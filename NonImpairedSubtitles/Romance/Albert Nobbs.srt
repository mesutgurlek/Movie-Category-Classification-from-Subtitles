- Good evening, Albert.
- Mrs. Baker, ma'am.

3
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:30,181
All right, girls,

00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,468
no finger marks
on the knife blades, please.

00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:47,365
What?

7
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:49,367
Well, Helen Dawes,
what are you grinning about?

8
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:52,405
Nothing, Mrs. Baker.
Sorry, Mrs. Baker.

9
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:14,927
Good evening, Mr. and Mrs. Moore.
Your table awaits.

10
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:16,686
Thank you.

11
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:25,104
What sweet roses, Nobbs.
You always remember.

12
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,567
Madam.

13
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,789

00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:44,498
Oh, right.

17
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:47,794
- You look gorgeous.
- Thank you.

18
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:49,506
What do you say,
the lamb or the beef?

19
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:52,514
Do you think we'll be able
to tell the difference?

20
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:53,720
Good evening.

Thank you.

25
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:14,365
Have the lamb, Dr. Holloran.
It will melt in your mouth.

26
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:16,246
The lamb it shall be, Duchess.

27
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:19,287
Sean, Dr. Holloran will take the lamb.

28
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:20,826
Yes, ma'am.

29
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,913
- Will you have the soup?
- I won't, thank you.

30
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,172
Sean.

31
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,554
- There's a stain on your tie.
- Ma'am?

32
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:34,056
Have a care, Sean.

33
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:36,467
Last week it was the jacket,
tonight the tie.

34
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:38,635
- Yes, ma'am, I'm sorry.
- Remember, there are hundreds,

35
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:41,100
hundreds of young men
walking the streets of Dublin

36
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:42,310
looking for work.

37
00:03:43,265 --> 00:03:44,767
Young men, Sean.

38
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:47,402
Good man, Nobbs.

00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:53,283

44
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:17,928
Terribly sorry.
I know. We're late,

45
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,843
but could you forgive us
just this once?

46
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,887
- We're simply famished.
- Of course.

47
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:24,681
Aubrey insisted we walk
all the way from Ballsbridge.

48
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:26,691
Well, milady, there's nothing
like a brisk walk

49
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,397
for giving a body an appetite.

50
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,154
Come along now,
your table is set and waiting.

51
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:35,275
Tell me, how is your mother,
dear Lady Yarrell?

52
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:37,160
- Tip-top, Mrs. B, tip-top.

53
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:39,617
I certainly hope she will come
and visit us soon.

54
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,782
She'd be delighted, I'm sure.

55
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,245
So sorry, dear lady.

56
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:46,457
No bother at all, Mr. Smythe-Willard.

57
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,463
- To be sure.

Well...

69
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:53,521
I wouldn't say no to a nightcap now,
sure I wouldn't.

70
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:58,191
Only I haven't a drop left, meself.

71

Good night, Mr. Casey.

Thruppence, Mrs. Cavendish,
when I brought her stationery.

79
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,358
Another thruppence from what's-his-name,
the Viscount's friend.

80

Tenner from the Viscount
and another from his missus.

four shillings, eight pence.

85
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:07,363
Ah, Mr. Gilligan, Madam, so good
to have had you with us again.

86
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:08,951
I hope your stay was satisfactory?

87
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:11,458
Yes. Perfectly fine. Thank you.

88
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:20,675
- For God's sake, man!
- I'm sorry, sir!

89
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:22,962
Look what you've done. You've ruined
my boots, defaced my luggage.

90
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:25,222
I've never seen such
blatant incompetence.

91
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,098
Are you all right, my dear?

92
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:28,975
Does that look all right to you?

93
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:30,886
Where's the manager?
Where's that fool Sweeney?

94
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:32,178
I'm very sorry, sir.

95
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,393
Yes, yes, everyone's sorry!
It's outrageous ineptitude.

96
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:37,230
Clean up the mess
you've made of my boots.

97
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:45,359
I won't patronize
this establishment again

98
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:48,574
and I will urge my friends
and acquaintances to do the same,

99
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:50,580
if you keep this man
in your employ.

Yes, Mr. Gilligan, sir.

101

- Now!
- Yes, sir.

00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:11,426
Fine.

104
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,775
Give us the marmalade there,
Mr. Donaghue.

105
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:29,532
- It's the marmalade.
- The marmalade, Patrick.

106
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:32,664
Will you pass the marmalade
to Mr. Casey?

Always on Tuesdays,
if I recall correctly.

- Who?

00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:10,752
so I've told him he can muddle in
with you for one night.

159
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:15,674
With... With me, ma'am?

160
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:18,381
Yes, Mr. Nobbs. With you.

161
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:21,597
- But...
- What?

162
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:23,261
What are you trying to say?

163
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:26,601
My bed is full of lumps.

164
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:28,482
Full of lumps?

165
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:34,110
Your bed was re-picked
and buttoned just six months ago.

166
00:13:34,272 --> 00:13:35,444
What are you talking about?

167
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:37,074
So it was, ma'am, so it was.

168
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:39,486
But you see,
I'm a very light sleeper,

169
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,700
and me being sleepless
might keep Mr. Page awake.

170
00:13:41,863 --> 00:13:45,663
I'm thinking he might be better off
on the sofa in the coffee room.

171
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:48,374
On the sofa in a coffee room?

172
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:51,039
I don't wish to be an inconvenience.
It's a fine night.

173
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:52,832
I'll keep meself warm
with a sharp walk.

174
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:55,343
You'll do nothing of the kind,
Mr. Page.

175
00:13:57,795 --> 00:14:00,093
Of course, Mrs. Baker.

176
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:02,975
If Mr. Page is pleased to share my bed,

177
00:14:03,134 --> 00:14:04,977
he's welcome, I'm sure.

178
00:14:05,136 --> 00:14:06,854
I should think so, indeed.

179
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:09,891
Right. That's settled then.

180
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:14,529
Mrs. Baker, ma'am, the man
about the boiler has just arrived.

181
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:17,114
Have you a letter from Holmans?

182
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:18,775
Holmans?

183
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:20,409
The plumbers? No.

184
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:22,161
I thought you said he was from Holmans?

185
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,663
Um, yes, I... Didn't they give you...

186
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:25,915
No, indeed.
I said nothing about Holmans.

187
00:14:26,074 --> 00:14:28,497
- I thought you said they gave you...
- I said I know about boilers.

188
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:32,293
And do you...
know about boilers?

189
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:33,672
I do, ma'am.

190
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,502
I'm an apprentice boiler man.

191
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:39,846
Well.

192
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:42,806
Since you're here,
you might as well come

193
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:44,967
and have a look at the blessed thing.

194
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:47,686
Thank you, Polly.

195
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:49,222
Thanks, ma'am.

It's the bane of our lives.

198
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:02,868
I'm depending on you to put
some manners on it.

199
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:05,371
We've our costume ball tomorrow

200
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:09,205
and it's of the utmost importance
that it's in full working order.

201
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:16,215
I'll do me best, ma'am.

202
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:19,260
Right then.

203

- No! Don't!

are concerned?

Ah, go on, you take the bed.

00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:21,353
I'll go downstairs

- So what then?

Mrs. Baker will have my hide

- You'll take the bed.
- And where will you sleep?

Here. I don't mind.

We didn't discuss that sort of thing.

Well, I wanted to...

00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:19,442
Will I take something in
to Mr. Page?

301
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:22,946
Oh, yes, good girl. He wants
to work through and finish early.

and, believe it or not,

309
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,428
he has tamed that boiler of ours.

310
00:25:46,587 --> 00:25:48,339
Oh, thank God for that.

311
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:52,385
Now, I've been thinking that we need
a strong man about the house,

312
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:55,350
So I've asked Mr. Mackins to stay on.

313
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:56,684
- Mr. Nobbs.
- Ma'am.

314
00:25:56,847 --> 00:25:58,849
After Mr. Mackins has
had something to eat,

315
00:25:59,016 --> 00:26:01,110
- would you show him to the yard room.
- Yes, ma'am.

316
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:03,145
Welcome to Morrison's, Mr. Mackins.

318
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:24,086
Mrs. Baker is talking
about a party tomorrow.

319
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:26,877
It's our fancy-dress ball.
We have it every year.

320
00:26:27,044 --> 00:26:29,763
We don't dress up.
It's only for the guests.

321
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:30,923
That's a shame.

322
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:32,262
Where are you from, then?

323
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:34,847
<font color="#808080">JOE:</font> - Where are you from?

- Cork.

325
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:38,646
Are you mad, are you?

326
00:26:38,806 --> 00:26:40,934
I'm from Galway, of course.

327
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,148
I declare to me granny,
if you can't tell the difference...

328
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:46,405
Cork, Galway, it's all the same
to a Dublin man.

329
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:49,487
Oh, a Jackeen, are you?
Never would have known.

330
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:53,371
Born and bred in Sheriff Street, where
no sheriff was ever known to venture.

this time, Mr. Nobbs?

333
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:09,924
Don't worry.

334
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:12,760
Your secret's safe with me.

335
00:27:12,923 --> 00:27:14,345
It's just...

It's just I'm afraid,

337
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:19,896

Not more tea.

345
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,417
Do you want to hear my story?

346
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:39,551
It's not much to tell.

347
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:43,643
I was married,
to a house-painter, as it happens,

348
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:45,227
a drunk and a bully.

349
00:28:45,933 --> 00:28:49,904
One night he came home scuttered,
gave me the usual hiding.

350
00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:53,692
Only this time he rounded it off
with an almighty kick,

351
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:58,153
and that was the end of that.

352

00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:13,010
I took his things, and I left.

00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:14,761
This is his work coat,

355
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:18,595
I kept it, all these years, to
remember him by, the fucking waster.

356
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:22,219
So you're still married.

357

Mrs. Donaghue, so you are.

So...

365
00:29:55,544 --> 00:29:58,548
you married a woman?

366
00:29:58,714 --> 00:30:01,558
I met a girl as lonely as myself.

367
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:06,813
We fixed up to get a place,
sharing the rent and all that.

368
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:08,895
She had her dressmaking,

369
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:10,400
I had me work.

370
00:30:11,393 --> 00:30:15,193
But people began to talk,
so we got married.

371
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:18,574
- But...
- What's your name?

372
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:20,618
Albert.

373
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:22,199
Your real name.

374
00:30:25,115 --> 00:30:26,367
Albert.

375
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:38,004
Listen, Mr. Page,
I hear tell you're a betting man.

376
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:41,256
Have you a tip
for Leopardstown tomorrow?

377
00:30:41,423 --> 00:30:43,221
I'm in need of a winner.

378
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:47,104
I lost me shirt on Lightning Lad
in the Gold Cup.

379
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:49,230
Lightning, my arse.

380
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:54,649
You did a grand job, Mr. Page.
Very salubrious.

381
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:56,154
Thank you, ma'am.

382
00:30:56,313 --> 00:30:58,907
If only I could afford
to have the whole place done.

383
00:30:59,733 --> 00:31:01,952
Could you possibly tell me
in your expert opinion,

384
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,987
how much do you think
it would cost?

385
00:31:04,154 --> 00:31:05,747
- What, to paint the whole interior?
- Indeed.

386
00:31:05,906 --> 00:31:08,455
Oh, well now...
Uh... let me think.

387
00:31:10,035 --> 00:31:13,630
Um... Well, there's all this out here.

388
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:17,467
And the coffee room.

389
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:25,224
- Is that the dining room?
- Yes.

390
00:31:25,384 --> 00:31:27,136
- And how many guest ﬂoors?
- Two.

391
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:28,804
Two.

392
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:31,598
Well, it's only an estimate, but...

393
00:31:32,474 --> 00:31:34,852
I'd say it couldn't be done
for under 200 pounds.

200? on, my.

00:40:09,198 --> 00:40:10,370
Your tea, sir?

469
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,292
Your Bushmills.

470
00:40:15,455 --> 00:40:17,628
Oh, good man, Nobbs.

471
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:22,011
Let's have a drop, shall we,
for an eye-opener.

472
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:25,556
That's good. Oh, dear.

473
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:27,971
<font color="#D900D9">(groans)</font>

474
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:36,059
<font color="#D900D9">(grumbles)</font>

475
00:40:42,023 --> 00:40:43,366
Everything all right, Albert?

476
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:46,907
Sir?

477
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:49,072
Is there something on your mind?

478
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:50,740
Oh, no. No, sir.

479
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:57,292
Well...

480
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:01,088
Well, sir, the fact is, uh...

481
00:41:03,086 --> 00:41:04,838
I've been thinking.

482
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:07,473
Oh, thinking, are you?

483
00:41:07,632 --> 00:41:09,054
- Yes, sir.
- Hmm.

484
00:41:09,801 --> 00:41:11,303
I've been thinking...

485
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:15,147
I might purchase a little business.

486
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:17,980
Ah, a business. Fancy that.

487
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:19,940
What kind of a business?

488
00:41:21,646 --> 00:41:23,239
Perhaps...

489
00:41:24,232 --> 00:41:26,951
- a little shop.
- Hmm.

490
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:29,954
What kind of a shop?

491
00:41:30,113 --> 00:41:32,866
I'm thinking, maybe... tobacco.

492
00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:37,125
Oh, well, yes, a tobacconist's, now?

493
00:41:37,286 --> 00:41:38,412
That would suit a man.

494
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:41,924
But a woman could serve
at the counter.

495
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:44,085
Yes, indeed, a woman could.

496
00:41:50,091 --> 00:41:51,593
You're not thinking
of taking a wife?

497
00:41:52,552 --> 00:41:54,179
Are you, Nobbs?

498
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:56,518
Who's the lucky lady?
<font color="#D900D9">(chuckles)</font>

499
00:41:56,681 --> 00:41:58,775
- Good morning, Dr. Holloran.
- Good morning, Mary.

500
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:00,731
Good morning, Mr. Nobbs.

501
00:42:03,104 --> 00:42:05,106
Get that out of your way there.

502
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:12,705
Women.

503
00:42:18,494 --> 00:42:21,714
Here. Oh! Whoa, there.

504
00:42:35,845 --> 00:42:37,438
Oh, mister.

505
00:42:37,597 --> 00:42:40,191
<font color="#D900D9">(vendors hawking, children shouting)</font>

506
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:13,557
Two counters,

507
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:18,646
one for tobacco... and things,

508
00:43:19,806 --> 00:43:21,808
the other for sweetmeats.

509
00:43:27,897 --> 00:43:29,945
There's a door behind

510
00:43:31,067 --> 00:43:33,035
leading to the parlor.

511
00:43:34,028 --> 00:43:36,372
The wife's parlor.

512
00:43:49,919 --> 00:43:53,139
But where do Hubert
and Cathleen sleep?

513
00:43:58,219 --> 00:44:00,768
- Need a hand there, Mr. Nobbs?
- No.

514
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:03,228
All right, don't lose your rag.

515
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:06,060
Lovely to see you again, ladies.

516
00:44:06,227 --> 00:44:09,481
- We'll be back.
- Thank you, Mrs. Baker.

517
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:13,277
There now, Albert will look after you.

518
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:30,634
Now she can have a clock
on a marble chimneypiece.

519
00:45:06,579 --> 00:45:07,751
Yes?

520
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:13,590
Mr. Nobbs.

521
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:19,092
I was... passing by.

522
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:23,304
Come in, come in.

523
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:33,148
Cathleen, this is Mr. Nobbs.

524
00:45:33,314 --> 00:45:35,863
Mr. Nobbs, my wife.

525
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:39,328
Mrs. Page.

526
00:45:39,487 --> 00:45:42,115
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Nobbs.

527
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:47,211
Well now,

528
00:45:48,663 --> 00:45:50,711
we were just about to have
a bit of dinner, Mr. Nobbs.

529
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:53,968
- Will you join us?
- Oh, no, thank you, Mrs. Page,

530
00:45:54,126 --> 00:45:59,428
I wanted to... to give you this.

531
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:01,684
You left it in my...

532
00:46:01,842 --> 00:46:03,970
in the room.

533
00:46:04,136 --> 00:46:07,265
You came all this way,
just to give me this.

534
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:09,433
It's the button from my work coat.

535
00:46:10,393 --> 00:46:13,272
- I didn't have another one to match.
<font color="#D900D9">(chuckles)</font>

536
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:17,613
Well, you have averted
a veritable tragedy, Mr. Nobbs.

537
00:46:17,775 --> 00:46:21,120
For that you must certainly stay
and have your dinner with us.

538
00:46:21,279 --> 00:46:23,953
Hubert, you take
Mr. Nobbs's coat and hat,

539
00:46:24,115 --> 00:46:26,834
and not have him standing there
like a stranger.

540
00:46:46,762 --> 00:46:51,017
Well, I... I thought she'd be...

541
00:46:51,183 --> 00:46:53,060
- different.
- Cathleen?

542
00:46:53,894 --> 00:46:54,895
In what way?

543
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:57,482
Well, she's...

544
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:02,028
- real.
- Ah, she's real, all right.

545
00:47:04,739 --> 00:47:06,537
So, you've been thinking
about my Cathleen, have you?

546
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:12,543
Or, how you might find
a Cathleen of your own?

547
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:18,760
Sit down.

548
00:47:31,307 --> 00:47:34,231
I thought you'd be dressed
as a woman at home.

549
00:47:35,186 --> 00:47:38,486
And what if a neighbor passing by
happened to look in the window?

550
00:47:38,647 --> 00:47:42,868
So... you never wear a dress?

551
00:47:43,027 --> 00:47:46,327
It's safer, this way.
But I don't need to tell you that.

552
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:52,124
And anyway, it's not like
we robbed a bank or killed someone.

553
00:47:57,708 --> 00:47:59,176
You know, um...

554
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:06,433
I never gave you
the chance to tell your story.

555
00:48:10,471 --> 00:48:12,644
So, why don't you tell me now?

556
00:48:21,941 --> 00:48:23,943
I don't know the beginning.

557
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:33,456
I was a...

558
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:36,414
bastard.

559
00:48:41,669 --> 00:48:45,719
Mrs. Nobbs, the woman
who was paid to raise me,

560
00:48:45,881 --> 00:48:48,760
she knew who I was,
but she never told me.

561
00:48:49,969 --> 00:48:52,939
Maybe she would have one day, but...

562
00:48:53,097 --> 00:48:54,815
she died suddenly.

563
00:48:54,974 --> 00:48:58,649
- Without telling you who you are?
- Yes.

564
00:48:59,687 --> 00:49:03,567
She gave me a picture of a lady
she said was my mother

565
00:49:04,316 --> 00:49:07,286
and she hinted, more than once,

566
00:49:07,445 --> 00:49:10,870
that my people were grand folk.

567
00:49:12,158 --> 00:49:14,126
I got a convent education

568
00:49:14,285 --> 00:49:17,129
because of a big allowance
from my mother's family.

569
00:49:17,288 --> 00:49:22,340
But one day, the Reverend Mother
told us that my mother was dead

570
00:49:22,501 --> 00:49:24,094
and we had to leave.

571
00:49:25,004 --> 00:49:27,507
So we went to live in Seven Dials.

572
00:49:27,673 --> 00:49:29,675
Had to go find work.

573
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:34,059
Thought I'd die living
among such rough people.

574
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:36,898
They were poor,

575
00:49:37,057 --> 00:49:39,276
living like animals.

576
00:49:39,435 --> 00:49:41,153
Indecently.

577
00:49:42,271 --> 00:49:44,899
Life without decency is unbearable.

578
00:49:48,194 --> 00:49:50,697
Then Mrs. Nobbs died.

579
00:49:51,864 --> 00:49:53,116
And you were what age?

580
00:49:54,325 --> 00:49:55,622
Fourteen.

581
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:04,965
So... you decided to become a man?

582
00:50:17,723 --> 00:50:19,441
One night.

583
00:50:21,143 --> 00:50:22,520
There was...

584
00:50:25,814 --> 00:50:27,532
There was five of them.

585
00:50:28,317 --> 00:50:31,366
They caught me and they...

586
00:50:33,405 --> 00:50:35,407
they pulled me apart.

587
00:50:37,993 --> 00:50:39,870
It was under the stairs.

588
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:48,796
They hurt me...

589
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:58,605
and then they left me there.

590
00:51:03,185 --> 00:51:04,528
Soon after that, I...

591
00:51:05,396 --> 00:51:09,697
I heard there was to be a big dinner
at the Freemasons Hall,

592
00:51:09,858 --> 00:51:13,032
and that they were short of waiters.
<font color="#D900D9">(chuckles)</font>

593
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:16,748
And back then, my...

594
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:19,956
my figure was just right
for a waiter's, so...

595
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:26,209
I managed to get
a second-hand suit of clothes,

596
00:51:27,209 --> 00:51:28,961
an evening suit.

597
00:51:30,254 --> 00:51:32,131
I didn't think they'd hire me,

598
00:51:32,298 --> 00:51:35,393
but they were shorthanded

599
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:37,269
and I got the job.

600
00:51:39,513 --> 00:51:41,732
I was paid 10 shillings.

601
00:51:49,231 --> 00:51:50,824
That was it.

602
00:51:58,741 --> 00:52:02,871
Since then, I've sewed round
tables of all the biggest places

603
00:52:03,037 --> 00:52:06,382
in London and Manchester,
Liverpool.

604
00:52:07,333 --> 00:52:08,630
Then...

605
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:14,093
Then I came to Morrison's.

606
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:16,925
<font color="#D900D9">(footsteps)</font>

607
00:52:18,093 --> 00:52:21,814
Right, you men, up you get, before
everything on the table is stone cold.

608
00:52:25,934 --> 00:52:28,733
"Oh, very salubrious, Mr. Page,

609
00:52:28,896 --> 00:52:31,649
very salubrious."
<font color="#D900D9">(chuckles)</font>

610
00:52:31,815 --> 00:52:33,158
Salubrious?

611
00:52:33,317 --> 00:52:35,991
Who does she think she is,
the Queen of England?

612
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:40,283
Oh, I'd love to get a squint at her,
the old trout.

613
00:52:40,449 --> 00:52:42,577
<font color="#D900D9">(Hubert and Cathleen laugh)</font>

614
00:52:53,045 --> 00:52:56,219
It must be nice, though, Mr. Nobbs,
working in a hotel.

615
00:52:57,341 --> 00:53:01,687
Always something happening,
something to give you a laugh.

616
00:53:14,066 --> 00:53:16,569
Yesterday...

617
00:53:16,735 --> 00:53:19,909
Sean Casey fell down
the coal-hole steps.

618
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:23,580
And who, may I ask, is Sean Casey?

619
00:53:23,742 --> 00:53:25,836
He's one of the waiters.

620
00:53:26,954 --> 00:53:29,173
And did he hurt himself?

621
00:53:29,331 --> 00:53:33,632
- He got a black eye.
- A black eye. In the coal-hole.

622
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:37,881
You're funny.

623
00:53:41,593 --> 00:53:45,643
Now, you'd better learn how to do this,
if you're going to open a tobacco shop.

624
00:53:46,598 --> 00:53:48,646
So we were speaking of Morrison's.

625
00:53:48,809 --> 00:53:53,406
That Helen Dawes, she's a fine girl.

626
00:53:53,564 --> 00:53:55,692
Aw, she's the life
of the place, she is.

627
00:53:58,861 --> 00:54:00,454
Helen, is it?

628
00:54:01,196 --> 00:54:05,121
That's not the first time that name's
been heard in this house, Mr. Nobbs.

629
00:54:05,284 --> 00:54:07,503
Hubert took quite a shine to her,
didn't you, now?

630
00:54:07,661 --> 00:54:08,662
Well...

631
00:54:08,829 --> 00:54:10,331
Look at you, you're all thumbs.
Give it to me.

632
00:54:10,497 --> 00:54:13,421
I'm just saying, you know, if one day
you should take it into your head

633
00:54:13,584 --> 00:54:15,461
to run off to America,

634
00:54:15,627 --> 00:54:18,050
I might indeed try me luck
with Miss Dawes.

635
00:54:18,213 --> 00:54:20,215
How could you deny
that sweet little face

636
00:54:20,382 --> 00:54:24,432
and all those lovely blonde curls?
Aw, she's gorgeous.

637
00:54:24,595 --> 00:54:26,814
- Try me luck, is it?

638
00:54:26,972 --> 00:54:28,849
I wouldn't be getting me hopes up,
Hubert Page,

639
00:54:29,016 --> 00:54:32,145
'cause I have no intentions
of budging from this spot.

640
00:54:32,311 --> 00:54:33,437
There you go, Mr. Nobbs.

641
00:54:50,454 --> 00:54:53,298
The shop is a sound idea, Albert.

642
00:54:53,457 --> 00:54:57,052
You've been shrewd in the way you've
saved up money, all these years.

643
00:54:57,211 --> 00:54:58,838
I haven't enough yet.

644
00:54:59,004 --> 00:55:01,473
You have it all stashed under
the mattress, is it, Mr. Nobbs?

645
00:55:01,632 --> 00:55:03,054
<font color="#D900D9">(coughs)</font>

646
00:55:03,217 --> 00:55:04,969
Easy now, little fella.

647
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:08,264
Could we have some water?
Are you all right?

648
00:55:11,350 --> 00:55:13,478
My dad, now there was a boozer,

649
00:55:13,644 --> 00:55:15,487
a fierce whore for the drink.

650
00:55:15,646 --> 00:55:18,115
None of us ever slept,

651
00:55:18,273 --> 00:55:20,025
we'd be lying there,

652
00:55:20,192 --> 00:55:22,661
shivering with the fright,
waiting for him to come home,

653
00:55:23,695 --> 00:55:25,493
knowing that if he did...

654
00:55:26,615 --> 00:55:28,663
there'd be no place to hide.

655
00:55:32,204 --> 00:55:33,877
He'd get up in the morning
with no memory

656
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:37,009
of having beat the stuffing
out of us the night before.

657
00:55:40,546 --> 00:55:42,719
You know what kept me
from killing him?

658
00:55:43,549 --> 00:55:44,846
What?

659
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:48,975
The thought of getting on a boat
and hopping it to America.

<font color="#D900D9">(indistinct chatter)</font>

661
00:57:19,186 --> 00:57:21,359
Good evening, Miss Dawes.

662
00:57:21,521 --> 00:57:23,273
Evening, Mr. Nobbs.

663
00:57:27,486 --> 00:57:28,988
Miss Dawes.

664
00:57:40,791 --> 00:57:44,796
I was wondering, Miss Dawes,
if you would care to come out for a walk.

665
00:57:46,046 --> 00:57:47,639
Uh, pardon me, Mr. Nobbs?

666
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:51,639
I'm off duty at 3:00 tomorrow

667
00:57:51,802 --> 00:57:53,804
and if you're not engaged...

668
00:57:53,971 --> 00:57:56,349
"Engaged"?

669
00:57:56,515 --> 00:57:59,735
No, I'm not engaged, Mr. Nobbs.

670
00:57:59,893 --> 00:58:04,364
But are you asking me
to walk out with you?

671
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:07,784
I am.

672
00:58:10,862 --> 00:58:12,364
Well, uh...

673
00:58:13,532 --> 00:58:16,411
Well, the thing is, I'm walking out
with Joe Mackins.

674
00:58:17,411 --> 00:58:20,460
I don't know what he'd say if I started
walking out with you, as well.

675
00:58:21,957 --> 00:58:23,459
Ah, yes.

676
00:58:27,671 --> 00:58:29,514
Good night, Miss Dawes.

677
00:58:31,299 --> 00:58:32,801
Mr. Nobbs.

678
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:37,185
<font color="#D900D9">(both laughing)</font>

679
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:39,441
He asked you to go for a walk?

680
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:42,853
That's a good one. The sly old dog.

681
00:58:47,357 --> 00:58:50,361
Why don't you go for a walk
with the charmer, then?

682
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:51,528
What?

683
00:58:51,695 --> 00:58:54,869
Sure, why not?
There's a whiff of money off him.

684
00:58:56,491 --> 00:58:58,914
Maybe he could take you out.

685
00:58:59,077 --> 00:59:00,670
Have a good time.

686
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:03,832
What about you?

687
00:59:04,708 --> 00:59:06,460
I'm not the jealous type.

688
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:11,048
Come here to me, Helen Dawes.

689
00:59:11,214 --> 00:59:15,890
If he lays a hand on you, I'd wring
his scrawny neck, so help me I will.

690
00:59:21,308 --> 00:59:22,480
Poke him up.

691
00:59:22,642 --> 00:59:24,519
See what he's after.

692
00:59:25,896 --> 00:59:28,524
Get him to take you somewhere fancy.

693
00:59:29,483 --> 00:59:33,454
Get him to buy you
something sweet, like yourself.

694
00:59:36,490 --> 00:59:38,413
Be sure not to keep him waiting.

695
00:59:38,575 --> 00:59:41,545
Not for me, not for Joseph.

696
01:00:03,475 --> 01:00:05,352
Were you afraid I wasn't coming?

697
01:00:06,686 --> 01:00:08,359
Not very.

700
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:25,372
Did you see that dress?

701
01:00:26,123 --> 01:00:28,342
Five guineas if it was a penny.

702
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:31,094
- Five guineas?
- At least.

703
01:00:34,005 --> 01:00:37,179
Lord, I love the smell
of roasting coffee.

704
01:00:41,513 --> 01:00:43,390
Would you like to go in?

705
01:00:48,186 --> 01:00:49,438
All right.

Look at the chocolates.

708
01:01:04,828 --> 01:01:06,705
Aren't they gorgeous?

709
01:01:07,747 --> 01:01:10,045
I'm afraid they'd cost a lot.

710
01:01:11,334 --> 01:01:13,007
Oh. Well...

711
01:01:14,296 --> 01:01:17,220
we'll go somewhere else,
somewhere cheaper.

712
01:01:18,133 --> 01:01:20,101
No, please.

713
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:52,960
May I help you?

714
01:01:53,668 --> 01:01:55,887
We'd like some chocolate, please.

715
01:01:56,046 --> 01:01:57,468
What kind of chocolate?

716
01:01:59,174 --> 01:02:01,393
Just chocolate.

717
01:02:02,052 --> 01:02:04,350
Dark chocolate? Milk chocolate?
Creams? Caramels?

718
01:02:04,512 --> 01:02:06,389
Nougat? Nuts?

719
01:02:06,556 --> 01:02:08,684
No, a box of chocolates.

720
01:02:10,518 --> 01:02:12,316
To take with us.

721
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:15,574
Oh, to take with you.
And not something to drink?

722
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:19,202
No. A box of chocolates.

723
01:02:19,361 --> 01:02:21,705
- One of those.
- Which one?

724
01:02:23,114 --> 01:02:24,115
Which one?

725
01:02:24,282 --> 01:02:26,956
That one, with the two ladies.

726
01:02:28,203 --> 01:02:29,250
Oh, no, wait.

727
01:02:29,955 --> 01:02:32,879
That one,
with the soldier and the lady.

728
01:02:33,041 --> 01:02:36,341
Wait, I can't decide.

729
01:02:39,214 --> 01:02:42,058
Then me dad died,
and I had to go out to work.

730
01:02:43,093 --> 01:02:44,845
First I was in service,

731
01:02:45,011 --> 01:02:47,434
then I served behind the counter
in a shop for a while.

732
01:02:50,392 --> 01:02:51,769
In a shop?

733
01:02:52,769 --> 01:02:54,066
Yes.

734
01:02:54,229 --> 01:02:55,606
In a draper's.

735
01:02:56,523 --> 01:03:00,744
Treated like dirt by any bloody bitch
with sixpence to spend.

736
01:03:01,987 --> 01:03:03,455
Where did you live?

737
01:03:03,613 --> 01:03:05,365
I had me own room.

738
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:09,123
Above the shop?

739
01:03:10,287 --> 01:03:12,039
Yes, above the shop.

740
01:03:18,044 --> 01:03:20,046
Do you know what, Mr. Nobbs?

741
01:03:21,214 --> 01:03:24,559
I think you are the strangest man
I've ever met.

742
01:03:27,679 --> 01:03:30,933
Chocolates, three shillings, sixpence.

743
01:03:31,099 --> 01:03:34,353
If every time we walk out
is to cost three and six,

744
01:03:34,519 --> 01:03:36,817
14 shillings a month,

745
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:40,154
twice, that's 28 shillings a month,

746
01:03:40,317 --> 01:03:41,910
two boxes a week.

747
01:03:42,068 --> 01:03:45,823
At this rate,
16 pounds, six shillings a year.

748
01:03:46,865 --> 01:03:48,287
Oh, Lord.

749
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:26,155
Perhaps I'd only need to court her
for three months.

Here.

752
01:04:49,094 --> 01:04:52,189
- Is this the best you could do?
- At least he bought me something.

753
01:04:52,347 --> 01:04:54,645
Oh, look at you, Miss High-and-Mighty.

754
01:04:54,808 --> 01:04:56,810
Lord Albert put ideas
in your head, did he?

755
01:04:56,976 --> 01:05:00,150
You should have seen him pay for it.
Blood from a turnip.

756
01:05:00,313 --> 01:05:02,156
Oh, so he's sweet on you then, eh?

757
01:05:02,315 --> 01:05:03,612
Hmm.

758
01:05:03,775 --> 01:05:05,698
- Well, next time...
- Next time?

759
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:08,909
Ask him for, I don't know,
a bottle of something.

760
01:05:09,072 --> 01:05:10,540
What sort of something?

761
01:05:10,698 --> 01:05:12,245
Whisky.

762
01:05:12,409 --> 01:05:14,628
A good bottle of malt.

763
01:05:14,786 --> 01:05:18,131
I like a drop of malt.
Say... Say it's for your brother.

764
01:05:18,289 --> 01:05:20,462
- I haven't got a brother.
- Well, he won't know that.

765
01:05:22,252 --> 01:05:26,132
I've walked out before, but never
with the likes of Albert Nobbs.

766
01:05:26,297 --> 01:05:29,517
- He's a freak, is what he is.
- He has manners, at least.

767
01:05:29,676 --> 01:05:31,303
Not like some people I could mention.

768
01:05:31,469 --> 01:05:34,439
Well, his manners won't get you
to America now, will they?

769
01:05:35,348 --> 01:05:37,021
What?

770
01:05:38,518 --> 01:05:40,566
I may not have manners...

771
01:05:42,730 --> 01:05:45,324
but I swear
I'm getting us out of here.

772
01:05:47,694 --> 01:05:50,163
There's no hope for us here, Helen.

773
01:05:52,490 --> 01:05:53,833
None.

774
01:05:56,035 --> 01:05:58,914
All my life I've dreamed of getting out

775
01:06:00,248 --> 01:06:02,046
and nothing's gonna stop me.

776
01:06:03,293 --> 01:06:06,046
America's the only place
for people like me.

777
01:06:06,212 --> 01:06:10,092
Over there, I'd learn fast and I'd work hard.
And we could have a life.

778
01:06:14,304 --> 01:06:16,102
Will you chance it with me?

779
01:06:19,350 --> 01:06:20,727
Will you?

780
01:06:23,146 --> 01:06:24,568
Yes.

781
01:06:26,441 --> 01:06:27,943
I love you, Joe.

782
01:06:29,527 --> 01:06:30,949
I love you.

783
01:06:33,948 --> 01:06:36,622
- Why are we going this way?
- You'll see.

784
01:06:37,619 --> 01:06:39,747
Can we not stop and have
a cup of tea somewhere?

785
01:06:40,705 --> 01:06:43,254
My heels are raw,
we've walked that far.

786
01:06:49,923 --> 01:06:51,220
What's this?

787
01:06:52,133 --> 01:06:53,806
Just imagine.

788
01:06:53,968 --> 01:06:57,472
Blue doors, cream walls inside,

789
01:06:58,348 --> 01:07:01,067
nice curtains on the upstairs windows.

790
01:07:01,893 --> 01:07:03,941
Up there a sign:

791
01:07:04,103 --> 01:07:06,982
Tobacconist, A. Nobbs.

792
01:07:07,982 --> 01:07:09,734
What do you think?

793
01:07:13,571 --> 01:07:16,074
It's big enough for a shop

794
01:07:16,241 --> 01:07:17,834
and for...

795
01:07:19,702 --> 01:07:22,831
for... people

796
01:07:22,997 --> 01:07:24,294
to live above.

797
01:07:27,669 --> 01:07:29,842
It's a very desirable property,

798
01:07:30,004 --> 01:07:33,008
and can only appreciate,
the agent said so.

799
01:07:33,174 --> 01:07:37,475
In 15 years, it will fetch
three times what it's worth now.

800
01:07:38,596 --> 01:07:40,269
Sell up then,

801
01:07:40,431 --> 01:07:43,025
move to some place by the sea.

802
01:07:45,061 --> 01:07:47,985
I've always wanted
to live by the sea.

803
01:07:49,566 --> 01:07:53,036
You haven't moved in and you've
already got yourself retired.

804
01:07:53,194 --> 01:07:56,494
But I just...
I just wanted to show it to you.

805
01:07:57,365 --> 01:07:59,709
You ask me to come out with you.

806
01:07:59,867 --> 01:08:02,711
You walk me off my feet,
and we end up in this back alley.

807
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:06,424
I've spent my life trying
to get out of holes like this.

808
01:08:06,583 --> 01:08:07,584
Helen?

809
01:08:09,085 --> 01:08:10,587
Helen.

810
01:08:13,131 --> 01:08:15,509
Please take me back.

811
01:08:15,675 --> 01:08:17,097
I'm tired.

812
01:08:23,349 --> 01:08:24,350
Thanks for the bottle.

813
01:08:28,771 --> 01:08:30,148
And the hat.

814
01:08:32,275 --> 01:08:34,698
Oh yes. Thank you.

815
01:08:39,073 --> 01:08:40,450
Where does he live?

816
01:08:40,617 --> 01:08:41,834
Who?

817
01:08:41,993 --> 01:08:44,837
- Your brother.
- Me brother?

818
01:08:44,996 --> 01:08:46,088
Oh. Me brother.

819
01:08:46,247 --> 01:08:49,091
In... In Mallow.

820
01:08:51,252 --> 01:08:53,129
But he often comes up to Dublin.

821
01:09:00,887 --> 01:09:02,104
Joe.

822
01:09:03,681 --> 01:09:04,898
Joe.

823
01:09:09,646 --> 01:09:12,195
<font color="#D900D9">(blows sharply)</font>
- Joe Mackins.

824
01:09:12,357 --> 01:09:14,359
You nearly made me wet meself.

825
01:09:18,029 --> 01:09:19,872
- Here.
- What's this?

826
01:09:20,823 --> 01:09:24,453
Well, well.
So his nibs coughed up, did he?

827
01:09:27,914 --> 01:09:29,666
This is good stuff.

828
01:09:29,832 --> 01:09:30,799
Good girl.

829
01:09:38,132 --> 01:09:39,975
Now see if you can screw
a few quid out of him.

830
01:09:40,134 --> 01:09:41,135
A few quid?

831
01:09:41,302 --> 01:09:43,304
The first one's always the hardest.

832
01:09:43,471 --> 01:09:45,394
But after that, it's like shelling peas.

833
01:09:45,556 --> 01:09:47,149
You don't know Albert Nobbs

834
01:09:47,308 --> 01:09:50,061
if you think we can get him
to pay our way out of here.

835
01:09:50,228 --> 01:09:52,230
He wouldn't give you
the steam off his water.

836
01:09:52,397 --> 01:09:54,570
He bought you those chocolates,
didn't he?

837
01:09:54,732 --> 01:09:56,075
And now this?

838
01:10:01,614 --> 01:10:02,957
Oh, and that hat.

839
01:10:07,161 --> 01:10:08,788
See, you got him hooked.

840
01:10:13,876 --> 01:10:15,378
Has he tried any...?

841
01:10:18,172 --> 01:10:20,174
- What?
- You know.

842
01:10:27,390 --> 01:10:29,438
Next time you go out with him...

843
01:10:31,102 --> 01:10:33,025
work him up a bit,

844
01:10:33,187 --> 01:10:35,155
see what he's made of.

845
01:10:35,314 --> 01:10:37,442
See if there's a sting in him.

846
01:10:37,608 --> 01:10:39,702
I'm not going out with him any more.

847
01:10:39,861 --> 01:10:42,205
Well, how else
we gonna get to America?

848
01:10:44,115 --> 01:10:46,584
You've got to walk out with him
<i>as</i> long as there is a bob in his pocket,

849
01:10:46,743 --> 01:10:49,087
and you've a hand to pull it out.

850
01:10:53,833 --> 01:10:55,176
Here, here.

851
01:10:58,629 --> 01:11:00,222
Come back tonight.

852
01:11:07,764 --> 01:11:09,311
Should I...

853
01:11:10,641 --> 01:11:12,985
tell her before we're married...

854
01:11:13,936 --> 01:11:16,359
or save it for the wedding night?

855
01:11:20,151 --> 01:11:22,449
She might call the police,

856
01:11:22,612 --> 01:11:25,206
who'd take us both to the station.

857
01:11:27,867 --> 01:11:33,340
If only I'd been able to ask Hubert
how she did it.

858
01:11:36,292 --> 01:11:38,545
She was like this when we came in.

859
01:11:40,546 --> 01:11:41,843
Is she going to die?

860
01:11:42,882 --> 01:11:45,476
- Has anyone else been here?
- No, only us.

861
01:11:47,929 --> 01:11:49,977
Ay, leave her with me.

862
01:11:50,139 --> 01:11:52,312
And wash your hands, all of you,
scrub them in carbolic.

863
01:11:52,475 --> 01:11:55,854
Mother of God,
is it the fever? Is it?

864
01:11:57,313 --> 01:11:58,439
Go on.

865
01:11:58,606 --> 01:12:00,859
Don't say anything to anybody.
I'll talk to Mrs. Baker.

866
01:12:03,110 --> 01:12:04,453
And wash your hands.

870
01:12:31,305 --> 01:12:32,306
Come on.

871
01:12:33,850 --> 01:12:34,942
Pick up your feet.

872
01:12:35,726 --> 01:12:37,148
That's it. Good boy.

873
01:12:37,311 --> 01:12:38,528
Monsieur Pigot.

874
01:12:38,688 --> 01:12:41,783
Monsieur Pigot, I insist you not go
without paying your bill.

875
01:12:41,941 --> 01:12:42,942
Send it on.

876
01:12:43,109 --> 01:12:46,033
But where is my man?
Where is my Patrick?

877
01:12:46,195 --> 01:12:48,118
Why isn't he here?

- But there's only one girl who died.
- Madam, madam, please.

881
01:12:54,954 --> 01:12:56,706
- She was sick when she came here.
- This is in the public interest.

882
01:12:56,873 --> 01:12:58,170
- This is my livelihood.
- I'm sorry.

883
01:12:58,332 --> 01:12:59,254
This is the way I earn my living.

884
01:12:59,417 --> 01:13:01,545

There's something
I have to tell you.

890
01:14:40,726 --> 01:14:42,444
What's that, then?

891
01:14:47,608 --> 01:14:49,656
Is it something I want to hear?

892
01:14:52,405 --> 01:14:53,952
I'm expecting.

893
01:14:57,284 --> 01:14:59,378
I'm going to have a baby.

900
01:16:57,029 --> 01:16:59,373
You do have a great gift
for exaggeration, Duchess.

901
01:16:59,532 --> 01:17:01,751
No, I am. I am.

902
01:17:01,909 --> 01:17:06,164

I've an office full of unpaid bills.

without you.

in heaven,

Mr. Nobbs,
will you eat something?

910
01:17:43,075 --> 01:17:44,873
Have you some porridge?

911
01:17:45,035 --> 01:17:47,129
Yes, of course.

Oh, yes, she's all right.

917

The fever never touched her.

Mr. Page...

925
01:19:30,432 --> 01:19:34,733
the two of us could always...
set up together.

926
01:19:37,189 --> 01:19:38,657
I mean...

927
01:19:39,525 --> 01:19:43,280
perhaps we could pool our money

928
01:19:43,445 --> 01:19:45,539
and buy a bigger shop.

929
01:19:46,782 --> 01:19:48,876
We could run it together.

930
01:19:49,034 --> 01:19:52,038
Just like you and Cathleen did.

931
01:19:52,204 --> 01:19:55,583
Or you could keep at
the house painting,

932
01:19:55,749 --> 01:19:58,093
and I could run the shop.

933
01:20:01,422 --> 01:20:03,390
What are you saying?

934
01:20:04,174 --> 01:20:05,767
Um...

935
01:20:05,926 --> 01:20:07,553
perhaps...

936
01:20:09,513 --> 01:20:12,983
I could live here, like Cathleen.

937
01:20:15,811 --> 01:20:17,813
Neither of us would be alone.

01:24:13,924 --> 01:24:17,349
So if you want to go out and find
someone to start a new life with

951
01:24:17,511 --> 01:24:19,513
then you go out and find that person.

952
01:24:22,891 --> 01:24:25,360
<font color="#808080">HELEN:</font> - I didn't say that, Joe.
<font color="#808080">JOE:</font> - Well, I'm not deaf, am I?

953
01:24:25,519 --> 01:24:27,567
I know what you said.
You couldn't help yourself.

954
01:24:27,729 --> 01:24:30,573
<font color="#808080">HELEN:</font> - Why would I ever say that?
<font color="#808080">JOE:</font> - Because it's what you think.

955
01:24:30,732 --> 01:24:33,827
<font color="#808080">HELEN:</font> - It's not fair, Joe.
<font color="#808080">JOE:</font> - Tell me what's fair.

956
01:24:33,986 --> 01:24:36,956
Tell me, tell me, tell me
what you think is fair.

957
01:24:37,114 --> 01:24:38,912
I'm all fucking ears.

958
01:24:39,074 --> 01:24:42,374
Nothing in this whole bloody place.
That's what.

959
01:24:43,203 --> 01:24:45,581
<font color="#808080">POLLY:</font> Good dog.

960
01:24:45,747 --> 01:24:47,920
Good, good dog.

961
01:24:48,083 --> 01:24:49,460
Are you all right, Mr. N?

962
01:24:54,047 --> 01:24:55,264
Are you all right?

963
01:25:09,730 --> 01:25:11,903
She's not worth it, you know.

964
01:25:13,692 --> 01:25:16,946
She's just full of that Joe Mackins.

965
01:25:17,779 --> 01:25:20,407
And he's a waster, if ever I met one.

966
01:25:21,867 --> 01:25:23,869
And he's put her in the family way.

967
01:25:24,995 --> 01:25:27,043
And now they're talking
about going to America.

968
01:25:27,164 --> 01:25:30,543
Ha. It's complete for show.

969
01:25:31,501 --> 01:25:33,094
Mark my words.

970
01:25:34,713 --> 01:25:36,932
He'll never take her.

971
01:25:37,090 --> 01:25:40,720
Not now. Not ever.

972
01:26:19,007 --> 01:26:22,352
It's a pity this place
isn't nearer Morrison's.

973
01:26:24,137 --> 01:26:26,890
You think we'd be let out
to walk in it if it was?

974
01:26:28,433 --> 01:26:30,561
It'd be Lord and Lady Snot

975
01:26:30,727 --> 01:26:32,900
swanking it
up and down the grass.

976
01:26:34,106 --> 01:26:35,653
Not you and me.

977
01:26:39,820 --> 01:26:42,949
You and Joe have been
down to the sea, haven't you?

978
01:26:44,783 --> 01:26:46,000
And what if we have?

979
01:26:46,159 --> 01:26:49,584
Well, it's just that
I don't think it's right

980
01:26:49,746 --> 01:26:52,795
for a girl to be keeping company
with two fellows.

981
01:26:53,709 --> 01:26:54,756
And I thought...

982
01:26:54,918 --> 01:26:56,591
What did you think?

983
01:26:59,214 --> 01:27:02,388
That you didn't care for me enough.

984
01:27:03,677 --> 01:27:05,304
Enough for what?

985
01:27:06,596 --> 01:27:10,066
We've been walking out, so-called,
for a while now.

986
01:27:10,225 --> 01:27:12,648
It's not natural to be just talking,

987
01:27:12,811 --> 01:27:15,735
never wanting to put your arm
around a girl's waist.

988
01:27:15,897 --> 01:27:17,899
But that's for when we're married.

989
01:27:18,066 --> 01:27:20,034
Married?

990
01:27:21,361 --> 01:27:24,991
This is the first time you've said
anything about getting married.

991
01:27:25,157 --> 01:27:28,411
I've put a deposit on the shop.

992
01:27:28,577 --> 01:27:29,874
A hundred pounds.

993
01:27:30,036 --> 01:27:32,789
The agent says he has another offer

994
01:27:32,956 --> 01:27:35,379
and that we have till Monday to decide.

995
01:27:36,376 --> 01:27:38,720
After that we'll lose the deposit.

996
01:27:38,879 --> 01:27:40,005
"We"?

997
01:27:41,506 --> 01:27:44,009
We'll make a great success of our shop.

998
01:27:44,176 --> 01:27:46,929
People will be coming to see us,

999
01:27:47,095 --> 01:27:50,190
having tea with us in the parlor.

1000
01:27:50,348 --> 01:27:52,316
And our wedding will be a great...

1001
01:27:53,977 --> 01:27:55,570
wonder.

1002
01:27:56,480 --> 01:27:58,278
A great wonder?

1003
01:27:59,191 --> 01:28:00,784
Oh, it would be that, all right.

1004
01:28:01,526 --> 01:28:04,530
Sometimes I think you're soft in the head,
did you know that?

1005
01:28:05,238 --> 01:28:08,583
What kind of man
would ask a girl to marry him

1006
01:28:08,742 --> 01:28:11,120
without ever having so much
as kissed her?

1007
01:28:11,286 --> 01:28:14,381
You must not love me if
you don't want to kiss me.

1008
01:28:14,539 --> 01:28:17,668
I don't want to many a man
who isn't in love with me.

1009
01:28:18,794 --> 01:28:20,296
But...

1010
01:28:22,672 --> 01:28:24,345
I do love you.

1011
01:28:34,601 --> 01:28:36,444
You call that kissing?

1012
01:28:45,612 --> 01:28:47,740
That's the way people in love kiss.

1013
01:28:48,490 --> 01:28:50,788
That's the way Joe Mackins kisses me.

1014
01:28:51,493 --> 01:28:53,291
That's the way I like to be kissed.

1015
01:28:55,038 --> 01:28:56,039
I'm going home.

1016
01:28:57,415 --> 01:28:58,917
Helen.

1017
01:28:59,084 --> 01:29:00,131
Helen, wait...

1018
01:29:00,293 --> 01:29:02,091
You're a fool of a man.

1019
01:29:02,254 --> 01:29:05,053
If you think me a fool of a man,
why did you walk out with me?

1020
01:29:05,215 --> 01:29:08,685
I don't know why. I wish I hadn't.

1021
01:29:08,844 --> 01:29:11,472
Anyway, you don't have to worry
about that any more.

1022
01:29:11,638 --> 01:29:13,060
What do you mean?

1023
01:29:13,223 --> 01:29:14,850
Please, Helen, wait.

1024
01:29:15,016 --> 01:29:17,064
What about the shoes and stockings
I ordered for you.

1025
01:29:17,227 --> 01:29:19,195
- What shall I do with them?
- I'll take the stockings.

1026
01:29:19,354 --> 01:29:20,606
- And the shoes?
- And the shoes.

1027
01:29:20,772 --> 01:29:22,774
And you'll wear them
when you walk out with Joe Mackins?

1028
01:29:22,941 --> 01:29:26,036
- Yes.
- He won't take you to America.

1029
01:29:26,194 --> 01:29:29,073
He'll leave you here.
You and the baby.

1030
01:29:29,239 --> 01:29:31,241
He will. He'll leave you.

1031
01:29:32,325 --> 01:29:33,668
No!

1032
01:29:33,827 --> 01:29:36,580
- He will not leave me!
- You'll be safe with me.

1033
01:29:36,746 --> 01:29:39,295
- He will not leave me!
- I'll take care of you both.

1034
01:29:39,457 --> 01:29:40,800
Stop it!

1035
01:29:41,668 --> 01:29:43,341
Why do you say that?

1036
01:30:16,369 --> 01:30:17,416
It's snowing.

1037
01:30:20,665 --> 01:30:23,043
Don't worry about the hat.

1038
01:30:23,209 --> 01:30:24,802
I'll buy you another one.

1039
01:30:25,962 --> 01:30:27,305
No.

1040
01:30:29,841 --> 01:30:31,184
Goodbye.

1041
01:31:11,383 --> 01:31:13,602
<font color="#D900D9">(gasps)</font> Your ladyship.

1042
01:31:15,512 --> 01:31:17,981
How wonderful to see you back.

1043
01:31:18,139 --> 01:31:19,391
- Miss Shaw.
- Thank you.

1044
01:31:19,557 --> 01:31:21,855
I've put you in your usual rooms.

1045
01:31:23,561 --> 01:31:24,904
There, now.

1046
01:31:25,063 --> 01:31:26,940
Joseph will look after you.

1047
01:31:27,107 --> 01:31:29,326
Out of my way.

1048
01:31:29,484 --> 01:31:31,111
Out of the way.

1049
01:31:33,738 --> 01:31:36,537
Oh, hop to it, you lazy fellow.
Hop to it.

1050
01:31:36,700 --> 01:31:39,294

1052
01:32:06,396 --> 01:32:07,864
What's that?

1053
01:32:08,773 --> 01:32:11,492
Oh, I never eat anything blue.
Please take it away.

1054
01:32:17,866 --> 01:32:20,164
Am I the last to know?

1055
01:32:20,326 --> 01:32:22,328
I'll throw her out, brazen hussy.

1056
01:32:22,495 --> 01:32:24,839
I'll throw them both out.
By God I will.

1057
01:32:24,998 --> 01:32:26,796
You'll do no such thing.

1058
01:33:21,054 --> 01:33:22,852
I can't do it, Helen.

1059
01:33:24,349 --> 01:33:26,693
I hate meself for it, but I can't do it.

1060
01:33:26,851 --> 01:33:28,649
It's the same old story
and you know it.

1061
01:33:28,812 --> 01:33:31,531
And how many times have you
seen it happen?

1062
01:33:35,401 --> 01:33:37,449
- It shouldn't have happened.
- But it did happen.

1063
01:33:37,612 --> 01:33:39,455
Yeah, but it happened too soon.

1064
01:33:43,201 --> 01:33:44,919
It will change us.

1065
01:33:46,496 --> 01:33:47,622
It will change me.

1066
01:33:50,041 --> 01:33:52,135
I don't want to be that person, Helen.

1067
01:33:55,171 --> 01:33:57,219
I don't wanna be me fuckin' dad.

1068
01:33:59,717 --> 01:34:01,560
I can't even fucking read.

1069
01:34:04,514 --> 01:34:05,481

<font color="#808080">JOE:</font> What have you done to us?
You've ruined everything.

You can't leave.

1072
01:34:12,272 --> 01:34:14,616
You wouldn't let me go
and now you say it's my fault?

1073
01:34:14,774 --> 01:34:18,324
<font color="#808080">JOE:</font> - I didn't mean that, Helen.
<font color="#808080">HELEN:</font> - What didn't you mean?

01:34:32,208 --> 01:34:33,460

You and the child.

He'll never take you to America.

1083
01:34:42,552 --> 01:34:43,724
What do you know,
you miserable little prick?

1084
01:34:43,887 --> 01:34:45,730
- Joseph...
- Huh? You were all talk just now.

1085
01:34:45,889 --> 01:34:47,357
Why don't you say to me
what you were saying to her?

1086
01:34:47,515 --> 01:34:49,313
Joe. Stop it.

1087
01:34:49,475 --> 01:34:51,773
You won't... You won't...
You won't take her to America.

1088
01:34:51,936 --> 01:34:53,688
That is none of your fucking
goddamn business.

1089

You did this to us.

1104
01:36:03,716 --> 01:36:06,515
You're a boozer, Joe Mackins,
Just like your father.

1105
01:36:06,678 --> 01:36:08,806
- I'm not like that bastard!
- A boozer and a dirty bully.

1106
01:36:08,972 --> 01:36:11,691
Get your paws off me, you fucking
nancy-boy. I'll smash your fucking face!

01:36:11,849 --> 01:36:13,476
I don't want you any more!

1108
01:36:18,856 --> 01:36:20,449
I don't want you.

1109
01:36:38,042 --> 01:36:40,761
- Joe.
- Helen, no, no.

1110
01:36:42,422 --> 01:36:44,345
- Come, let's go.
- No!

1111
01:37:19,625 --> 01:37:21,298

01:38:30,696 --> 01:38:33,199
Lucy, would you go downstairs
and get some coal.

1114
01:38:34,242 --> 01:38:38,497
A big load of coal. This has got
to be kept red hot for my cooking.

1115
01:38:38,663 --> 01:38:41,257
- Ow!

Now there's the black pudding.

1117
01:38:43,251 --> 01:38:46,676
Now, which room ordered kippers?
Was it seven or nine?

1118
01:38:46,838 --> 01:38:48,556
- Seven.
- Seven. Good girl.

1119
01:38:48,714 --> 01:38:51,058
Get me a nice plate for the kippers.
Now we've got everything else.

1120
01:38:51,217 --> 01:38:54,517
Chicken livers, bacon,
black pudding, black pudding,

1121
01:38:54,679 --> 01:38:57,432
prunes, sausages, jam, milk.

1122
01:38:57,598 --> 01:38:59,066
Yeah, we got everything.
Now watch out.

That's fine. I'll take it from here.

Oh, Albert Nobbs.

Albert Nobbs, a woman?

1135
01:42:37,360 --> 01:42:41,240
Yes. Did you not hear about it?
It was in all the papers.

1136
01:42:41,405 --> 01:42:43,157
I mean the death was bad enough,

1137
01:42:43,324 --> 01:42:45,952
but then all those years,
and no one suspecting.

1138
01:42:46,118 --> 01:42:50,624
Not even you, and you slept here,
in the same bed with him.

1139
01:42:51,499 --> 01:42:52,546
Her.

1140
01:42:54,043 --> 01:42:57,217
And Dr. Holloran left us.

1141
01:42:58,297 --> 01:43:01,676
Took off to England with,
what's-her-name, Mary.

1142
01:43:01,842 --> 01:43:04,721
Said he was tired of secrets.
Can you imagine?

1143
01:43:05,721 --> 01:43:07,894
And that good-for-nothing Joe Mackins
went off to America,

1144
01:43:08,057 --> 01:43:12,107
and left me with an unwed hussy
of a maid, with a brat.

1145
01:43:12,269 --> 01:43:14,863
Now, Mr. Page, I have a heart.

1146
01:43:15,773 --> 01:43:17,366
I couldn't throw her out
onto the streets

1147
01:43:17,525 --> 01:43:19,323
and call myself a Christian,
now could I?

Oh, my lordship.

1150
01:43:27,118 --> 01:43:30,418
I trust you're finding
your suites satisfactory.

1151
01:43:30,579 --> 01:43:33,753
Splendid, Mrs. B. Splendid.

1152
01:43:33,916 --> 01:43:38,296
However, we seem to have misplaced
the key to the connecting door.

1153
01:43:38,462 --> 01:43:40,055
Could you have your man
open it for us?

1154
01:43:40,214 --> 01:43:41,932
I'll have it done right away.

1155
01:43:42,091 --> 01:43:43,343
Thank you.

1156
01:43:44,719 --> 01:43:46,221
I have an appetite.

1157
01:43:49,306 --> 01:43:51,183
Lovely, lovely people.

1158
01:43:53,060 --> 01:43:55,154
- So you want the whole place painted?
- Yes.

1159
01:43:55,312 --> 01:43:57,815
Top to bottom. You'll have
to hire in help, I should think.

1160
01:43:58,607 --> 01:44:01,952
Well, it's a big job.
It won't be cheap, ma'am.

1161
01:44:02,111 --> 01:44:05,866
Oh, don't worry about that.
I... I came into a bit of money.

1162
01:44:07,283 --> 01:44:09,377
A bit of good fortune.

1163
01:44:09,535 --> 01:44:12,209
Well, to work, Mr. Page.

1164
01:44:12,371 --> 01:44:15,124
I've put you up in Albert's old room.

I heard Mrs. Baker

01:46:10,364 --> 01:46:13,163
Well, it's a big job
she wants me to do.

1172
01:46:14,618 --> 01:46:15,870
Good.

1173
01:46:18,706 --> 01:46:19,798
May I?

is letting you stay, is she?

1180
01:47:04,418 --> 01:47:06,887
Oh, she told you that, did she?

1181
01:47:08,005 --> 01:47:10,224
Out of the kindness
of her Christian heart?

1182
01:47:13,761 --> 01:47:16,890
The truth is, Mr. Page...

1183
01:47:17,056 --> 01:47:19,024
The truth is,

1184
01:47:19,183 --> 01:47:21,231
she says she won't tell the priest
about my Albert

1185
01:47:21,393 --> 01:47:23,361
as long as I work here for nothing.

1186
01:47:28,567 --> 01:47:31,070
But they are going to take
him away from me.

1187
01:47:32,738 --> 01:47:34,581
You know they will.

1188
01:47:39,328 --> 01:47:42,047
And they will throw me
out onto the street.

1189
01:47:45,960 --> 01:47:47,962
It's just a matter of time.

1190
01:47:52,800 --> 01:47:54,143
Well, now...

1191
01:47:56,428 --> 01:47:58,772
We can't let that happen, can we?
