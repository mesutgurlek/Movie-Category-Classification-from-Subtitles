Fucking dark in here.

163
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:28,009
Corky's doing some work
for Mr Bianchinni.

164
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:30,923
Oh, yeah, yeah. Right.
Don mentioned that to me.

165
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:33,080
Uh... I’m sorry.

166
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:36,207
Hi. Welcome to the family.

167
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:39,605
So, uh, you're working
with Rajeev, right?

168
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:42,204
No. Rajeev's in India.

169
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:45,521
- She's doing the work herself.
- No shit.

170
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:48,329
Bianchinni hired you. You
must be good with your hands.

171
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:50,719
- He's a good friend.
- That's what Violet says.

172
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:53,165
Family, really.

173
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:55,525
- So, when did you get out?
- Jesus, Ceasar.

174
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:58,044
What? It ain't
no big fucking deal.

175
00:15:58,130 --> 00:16:00,166
I know who Don hires.

176
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:04,846
You know, he did time himself.
13 fucking years.

177
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:06,761
What did you do?

178
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:10,559
- 5.
- 5. That's not bad.

179
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:12,129
What for?

180
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:14,485
None of your
goddamn business, Ceasar.

181
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:17,130
Right. It's none
of my goddamn business.

182
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:19,678
You don't have to tell me.
Look, it's just...

183
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,761
I want you to understand
one thing, all right?

184
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:25,445
You're amongst good people here.

185
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:35,045
Come on. Come on.

186
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:38,281
If you understand what I'm
talking about, you'll take it.

187
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:42,886
If you don't, then I'm
gonna have to worry about you.

188
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:49,205
Good. I hate to worry.

189
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:51,326
I got ulcers.

190
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:56,010
- I should be going.
- Why?

191
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:58,001
Nah. Stick around.
Get her a drink.

192
00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:00,445
No. I got to go
clean out my brushes.

193
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:02,919
Another time.

194
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:05,922
Right. Another time.

195
00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:24,448
Corky, Corky.

196
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:26,521
What are you doing?

197
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:53,283
- I had to see you.
- Look...

198
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:55,042
I don't think
this is a good idea.

199
00:17:55,130 --> 00:18:02,002
- I wanted to apologise.
- Oh, please, don't apologise.

200
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:05,082
I can't stand women
who apologise for wanting sex.

201
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:14,128
I'm not apologising
for what I did.

202
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:19,523
I'm apologising
for what I didn't do.

203
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:44,088
You have a bed somewhere?

204
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:16,207
I can see again.

205
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:35,447
I needed that.

206
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:41,803
- So Ceasar's Mafia, huh?
- You have to ask?

207
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:44,848
- No.
- Funny.

208
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:47,046
Nobody really calls
it that anymore.

209
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:49,166
Ceasar just calls it
"The Business".

210
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:54,278
- How d'you meet him?
- Took over a club I worked at.

211
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:56,247
Ceasar managed it.

212
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:59,527
- He's a launderer?
- Basically.

213
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:03,489
- How long you been with him?
- About 5 years.

214
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:09,642
- 5 years is a long time.
- Yes, it is.

215
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:14,444
- The redistribution of wealth.
- Excuse me?

216
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:18,648
That's what you wanted to know,
isn't it? What I did time for?

217
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:21,563
The redistribution of wealth?

218
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:24,448
That's what I tell someone
I'm trying to get in my bed.

219
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:27,169
But I'm already in your bed.

220
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:33,480
My cellmate would say she did
her time for getting caught.

221
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:36,004
She was always
a lot more honest than me.

222
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:40,208
You didn't have to tell me
if you didn't want to.

223
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:43,168
I guess I wanted to.

224
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:50,605
- I'm glad you did.
- So am I.

225
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:54,725
[# Hallelujah, I love her so #
playing]

226
00:21:57,770 --> 00:22:00,489
# Let me tell you
about a girl I know

227
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:03,767
# She's my baby
and she lives next door

228

# Every morning
before the sun comes up

229

# She brings my coffee
in my favourite cup

230

# That's why I know... #

231
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:13,086
You think I don't know
that he's gone?

232
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:14,762
Come on. Just...

233
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:16,966
I have to leave tonight.

234
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:19,518
Come on. Don't make
me beg, Violet.

235
00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:24,001
Oh, come... 2 Minutes. Da-dink.

236
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:26,361
[Door buzzes]

[Knocking on door]

238
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:39,009
You look great.

239
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:47,520
[Violet moaning]

240
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:53,279
[Violet]
I had this image of you...

241
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:55,201
inside of me,

242
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:58,088
like a part of me.

243
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:03,087
You are so beautiful.

244
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:08,407
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

245
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:10,759
Yes, there is.

246
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:13,318
You didn't want
to see me, did you?

247
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:16,607
If there's one thing I can't
stand about sleeping with women,

248
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:18,521
it's all the fucking
mind reading.

249
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:20,879
I don't understand.

250
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:22,369
I know.

251
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:24,247
Violet, that's because
you can't understand.

252
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:25,365
We're different.

253
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:27,600
We're not that different, Corky.

254
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:30,488
Ahh, let's see.

255
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:32,879
This is the part
where you tell me

256
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:34,608
what matters is on the inside,

257
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:36,726
and that inside of you,

258
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:38,687
there's a little dyke
just like me.

259
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:40,169
No, she's nothing like you.

260
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:42,605
She's a whole lot
smarter than you are.

261
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:44,601
Is that what
her daddy tells her?

262
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:46,248
I know what I am.

263
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:48,969
I don't have to have it
tattooed on my shoulder.

264
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:51,200
What are you saying,
you don't have sex with men?

265
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:52,928
I don't.

266
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:57,242
For Christ's sake, Violet.
I heard you.

267
00:23:57,330 --> 00:23:59,127
Thin walls, remember?

268
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:02,247
What you heard wasn't sex.

269
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:07,006
- What the fuck was it?
- Work.

270
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:12,926
You made certain choices
in your life that you paid for.

271
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:16,400
You said you made them because
you were good at something

272
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:18,401
and it was easy.

273
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:20,799
Do you think you're the only
person that's good at something?

274
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:26,006
We make our own choices.
We pay our own prices.

275
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:28,729
I think we're more alike
than you care to admit.

00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:35,769
Don't tell me.
You're a workaholic.

279
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:38,159
No. Shelly knows what I am.

280
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:41,481
He saw me in a bar
with another woman.

281
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:45,324
Yeah. I suppose he
just wants to watch.

282
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:48,447
Fuck it. I think
you'd better leave.

283

321
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:39,562
I didn't use a good towel.

322
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:42,608
I'm serious. I can't take this.
I have to get out of here.

323
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:46,808
Why? Because you know him?

324
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:49,759
Oh, you see...

325
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:52,603
Baby, that's what
I love about you.

326
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:55,409
You're so fucking sensitive.

327
00:27:56,330 --> 00:27:58,321
But I like you here.

328
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:00,719
I want you to stay.

329
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:03,608
You know, this is
hard on me, too.

330
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:05,885
I like Shelly.

331
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:08,680
So why don't you watch some TV

332
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:10,761
or put on a cassette
or something?

333
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:19,487
Are you OK, Violet?

334
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:22,687
Mick, why is Johnnie here?

335
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:26,160
You know how I feel
about that psycho fuck.

336
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:29,039
Ceasar, didn't I tell you
to get something?

337
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:32,281
Sure. Sorry, Mickey.

338
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:37,559
You shouldn't have to see this.

339
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:40,118
Why don't you get outta here?
Go for a walk.

340
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:42,849
Ceasar wants me to stay.

341
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:47,525
Don't worry about Ceasar.

342
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:49,919
I'll handle Ceasar.

343
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:56,599
- You just get out of here. OK?
- OK. Thank you, Mickey.

344
00:28:56,690 --> 00:28:57,725
[Man grunts]

345
00:28:57,810 --> 00:28:59,243
Here you go, Mick.

346
00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:00,968
[Johnnie]
Go all fucking night, Baby!

347
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:03,325
All night!

348
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:05,480
[Man grunting]

349
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:12,167
Hey, Johnnie, ease up, OK?

350
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:15,645
Bitch!

351
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:20,760
[Mickey] Pick him up.

352
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:30,328
Shelly.

353
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:33,407
I'm going to ask you 10 times.

354
00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:35,845
You understand?

355
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:37,124
10 times.

356
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:39,121
[Shelly whimpering]

357
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:53,679
One.

358
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:55,249
Where's our money?

359
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:56,285
Aah, God!

360
00:29:56,370 --> 00:29:57,769
[Snip]

361
00:29:57,850 --> 00:29:58,839
Ohh!

362
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:01,203
[Muffled screaming]

363
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:17,848
You all right?

364
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:33,328
Come on. Let's get outta here.

365
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:38,925
Keep it.

366
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:58,083
Shelly was skimming
from the business.

367
00:30:58,170 --> 00:31:00,400
He came to see me yesterday

368
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:03,288
because he was afraid
Ceasar found out.

369
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:06,089
He wanted to run, but he
wanted me to come with him.

370
00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:09,640
- Even though he knew about you.
- Yeah.

371
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:12,005
What, this guy's
in love with you, right?

372
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:15,082
That's what he tells himself,
but it's not even about me.

373
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:17,047
You see, he could
have run at any time,

374
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:19,041
but he didn't want out.

375
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:20,688
Sounds like he wanted
to get caught.

376
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:23,159
Yeah. Maybe he did.

377
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:25,844
He would brag
to me all the time.

378
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:29,127
He was never afraid
of Ceasar because...

379
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:30,689
he didn't know him.

380
00:31:30,770 --> 00:31:32,203
Not like I do.

381
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:36,245
I used to be able
to block it out.

382
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:38,685
I would just tell myself

383
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:43,400
that I wasn't really
there, and so...

384
00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:46,448
none of it really mattered.

385
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:50,085
But I can't do that any more.

386
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:55,844
I'm making the same
mistake Shelly made,

387
00:31:55,930 --> 00:31:57,568
but now...

388
00:31:57,650 --> 00:31:59,925
I know what I want.

389
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:05,598
I want out.

390
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:09,758
I want a new life.

391
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:14,887
I see what I've been waiting
for, but I can't do it alone.

392
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:23,919
I need your help, Corky.

393
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:30,799
Ceasar's gonna get the money.
He's gonna bring it...

394
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:31,800
How much money?

395
00:32:31,890 --> 00:32:33,926
Shelly said
it's over $2 million.

396
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:38,682
Yeah.

397
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:40,249
So Ceasar's going to get it.

398
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:41,649
He's going to bring it
by the apartment.

399
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:42,924
He's going to count it.

400
00:32:43,010 --> 00:32:45,922
He'll go through the books and
figure out how Shelly did it.

401
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:48,683
Violet, do you know
what you're saying?

402
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:52,319
You're asking me
to help you fuck over the Mob.

403
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:54,321
Violet, these people
are serious.

404
00:32:54,410 --> 00:32:57,163
You wanna know how serious,
you ask your friend Shelly.

405
00:32:57,250 --> 00:33:00,879
They are worse than cops because
they have money and no rules.

406
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:02,722
You fuck them,
you'd better do it right.

407
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:04,482
That's why I need your help.

408
00:33:04,570 --> 00:33:07,846
- You said you were good.
- I AM good.

409
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:12,161
All right, let's just
say for a moment

410
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:13,922
I believe everything
you're saying.

411
00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:17,127
- You think I'm lying?
- I didn't say that,

412
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:20,805
but since you did,
let's say you are.

413
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:23,450
It would have been easy
for you to set up Shelly.

414
00:33:23,530 --> 00:33:24,679
You could have had him killed

415
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:29,446
knowing that Ceasar would bring
the money back to the apartment.

416
00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:32,442
All you'd need to keep yourself
clean is someone unconnected:

417
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:34,568
Someone like me.

418
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:40,608
- Is that what you think?
- I'm just making a point.

419
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:45,000
You have no idea
what you're asking,

420
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:49,959
how much trust it takes 2 people
to do something like this.

421
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:56,482
I mean, stealing's always
been a lot like sex.

422
00:33:56,570 --> 00:34:01,439
2 people who want the same
thing, they get in a room.

423
00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:02,883
They talk about it.

424
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:06,440
They start to plan.
It's kind of like flirting.

425
00:34:06,530 --> 00:34:09,203
It's kind of like foreplay,

426
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:13,442
because the more they talk
about it, the wetter they get.

427
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:18,289
The only difference is,
I can fuck someone I just met,

428
00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:21,004
but to steal,

429
00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:23,524
I need to know someone
like I know myself.

430
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:27,046
You think you know me like that?

431
00:34:28,810 --> 00:34:30,641
I want to see the money.

432
00:34:33,450 --> 00:34:37,523
- Oh, my God.
- Don't worry. It ain't mine.

433
00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:48,004
- Ceasar, what happened?
- It was unbelievable, Vi.

434
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:51,127
Un-fucking-believable.

435
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:55,089
Shit. Look at this shirt.
Look at it. It's ruined.

436
00:34:55,170 --> 00:34:57,604
It all started when Shelly
took us to the money.

437
00:34:57,690 --> 00:35:00,204
I'll tell you something.
Mickey? He knows his shit.

438
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:02,360
He does. Shelly
took us right there.

439
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:04,805
So Shelly's down
on his knees, right?

440
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:06,528
And he's pulling out
this money

441
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:08,168
from the safe on the floor.

442
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:09,763
And I'm there,
I'm standing there,

443
00:35:09,850 --> 00:35:12,159
and I'm looking at it, right?

444
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:14,559
Like, "Holy fuck,"
and all I can think about

445
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:17,801
is, "How the fuck
was he able to do this?"

446
00:35:17,890 --> 00:35:19,289
When... Bang!

447
00:35:19,370 --> 00:35:20,769
Johnnie caps him.

448
00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:22,647
He capped Shelly!

449
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:24,083
Blood goes flying everywhere,

450
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:25,489
all over me, all over the money.

451
00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:28,562
I have no idea if this
is even all of it.

452
00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:33,641
And right then, I go
through the roof, and... BAM!

453
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:35,368
I punch the dumb son of a bitch.

454
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:38,044
I punch him, Vi, right
in his dumb fucking face.

455
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:39,768
I didn't give a shit
whose son he was.

456
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:41,488
I just wanted to hit him again,

457
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:44,243
smack some sense into
the dumb son of a bitch.

458
00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:47,288
Look at the shit that I
got to fucking deal with now.

459
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:48,519
What'll you do with it?

460
00:35:48,610 --> 00:35:50,521
I told him to run it
through the cycles, but no.

461
00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:53,408
Johnnie calls up the old man,
and I guess he's got other plans

462
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:56,846
because he wants to pick up
this shit tomorrow night.

463
00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:04,928
- Where's the laundry detergent?
- It's in the linen cabinet.

464
00:36:23,490 --> 00:36:27,483
Come to my place
in the morning... early.

465
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:31,409
[Violet] You think you
know me like that... like that...

466
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:33,242
[Violet's voice echoes]

467
00:36:34,370 --> 00:36:36,122
[Corky] $2 million.

468
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:40,647
[Violet]
You're having second thoughts.

469
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:42,209
No.

470
00:36:42,290 --> 00:36:44,804
You said Ceasar washed
the money?

471
00:36:44,890 --> 00:36:46,243
Yeah.

472
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:48,161
Then what, exactly?

473
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:50,923
- He hung it up.
- He what?

474
00:36:51,010 --> 00:36:53,319
To let it dry.

475
00:36:55,490 --> 00:36:57,208
It was unreal.

476
00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:07,887
Hundreds paper-clipped
everywhere like leaves.

477
00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:18,844
Then, one by one,
he ironed all of it.

478
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:27,763
- Did he sleep?
- No, but neither did I.

479
00:37:32,610 --> 00:37:35,647
All night long,
I listened to that sound.

480
00:37:35,730 --> 00:37:38,802
- What sound?
- The sound of money.

481
00:37:44,290 --> 00:37:48,363
- Where is it now?
- It's in his office.

482
00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:51,123
I saw it this morning.

483
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:57,803
I need to go to the store.

484
00:38:01,330 --> 00:38:03,924
[Violet]
It's in a case on his desk.

485
00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:05,523
[Corky] Does the case lock?

486
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:08,761
- Yes.
- Huh.

487
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:12,241
- Tell me about Johnnie.
- Johnnie?

488
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:14,127
Yeah. Sounds like he and Ceasar
don't like each other.

489
00:38:14,210 --> 00:38:16,007
Like each other?
They hate each other.

490
00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:18,081
- Why?
- I don't know.

491
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:19,842
Happened long before
I came around.

492
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:23,684
I think basically, Ceasar thinks
Johnnie's a complete idiot,

493
00:38:23,770 --> 00:38:26,238
but, you know, what can you do?

494
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:28,890
Johnnie runs Chicago
'cause Gino's his father.

495
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:30,005
Who's Gino?

496
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:33,241
Gino Marzzone.

497
00:38:34,370 --> 00:38:36,042
Marzzone.

498
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:38,564
As in Angelo Marzzone,
head of the Marzzone family?

499
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:40,606
Yeah. That's his brother.

500
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:44,042
Shit.

501
00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:46,405
Gino Marzzone's coming
to your place tonight

502
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:47,479
to pick up the money?

503
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:49,208
Yeah.

504
00:38:49,290 --> 00:38:51,645
And Johnnie Marzzone's
his son. That's Johnnie?

505
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:53,083
Yeah.

506
00:38:55,610 --> 00:38:57,601
Sweet Jesus.

507
00:39:03,850 --> 00:39:05,647
It's perfect.

508
00:39:05,730 --> 00:39:07,288
Gino Marzzone's coming
to your place tonight.

509
00:39:07,370 --> 00:39:08,439
This is the big deal.

510
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:09,849
Ceasar's gonna want
to do it right.

511
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:11,249
He's not going to want
to look like an idiot.

512
00:39:11,330 --> 00:39:12,809
Has Gino ever been
to your place before?

513
00:39:12,890 --> 00:39:15,245
- Yeah, twice before.
- What happened?

514
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:18,447
Well, Ceasar was really nervous.
He kept cleaning the apartment.

515
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:22,284
The first time, he picked out
the dress he wanted me to wear.

516
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:25,601
- Did Johnnie ever hit on you?
- He hits on me all the time.

517
00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:27,487
He hits on anything
in high heels.

518
00:39:27,570 --> 00:39:28,923
Did Ceasar ever see this?

519
00:39:29,010 --> 00:39:30,841
He does it right
in front of him.

520
00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:33,967
Oh, this is getting
better and better. Go on.

521
00:39:34,050 --> 00:39:36,723
Well, Gino doesn't
speak much English,

522
00:39:36,810 --> 00:39:37,879
or at least he pretends not to,

523
00:39:37,970 --> 00:39:39,881
so he usually gets
right to the point.

524
00:39:39,970 --> 00:39:42,768
Both times, they only
talked for about 5 minutes.

525
00:39:42,850 --> 00:39:44,681
They had a drink,
and then they left.

526
00:39:44,770 --> 00:39:45,964
What did Gino drink?

527
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:48,086
Scotch. Glenlivet.

528
00:39:48,170 --> 00:39:51,719
I remember that because Ceasar
made a big deal about it.

529
00:39:53,890 --> 00:39:56,040
All right.

530
00:40:02,570 --> 00:40:04,686
I've an idea how
to make this work.

531
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:07,686
[Corky] Go back and get ready.

532
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:09,840
Take your time. Make it real.

533
00:40:09,930 --> 00:40:12,808
What time did you
say they'd be there?

534
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:15,165
[Violet]
The plane gets in at 7:00, so...

535
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:16,842
I'd say around 8:00.

536
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:18,124
[Corky] All right.

537
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:20,519
Now, at some point,
Ceasar's going to quit,

538
00:40:20,610 --> 00:40:22,521
I guess some time around 6:00,

539
00:40:22,610 --> 00:40:24,362
making sure he's got
time to get ready.

540
00:40:24,450 --> 00:40:27,487
As soon as he's done
you'll be right there

541
00:40:28,290 --> 00:40:29,120
to put a big drink
in his hand.

542
00:40:29,210 --> 00:40:32,520
[Ceasar] Unbelievable
what this guy Shelly did.

543
00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:35,170
I'll tell you, Shelly's
one smart-ass motherfucker.

544
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:39,084
I mean, he WAS one
smart-ass motherfucker.

545
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:42,719
Poor boy has to work so hard.

546
00:40:45,490 --> 00:40:46,764
[Violet moans]

547
00:40:46,850 --> 00:40:50,968
[Corky]
We want him to relax, unwind.

548
00:40:51,050 --> 00:40:53,644
You look good enough to eat.

549
00:40:55,010 --> 00:40:56,238
[Violet] Where will you be?

550
00:40:56,330 --> 00:40:58,082
[Corky] I'll be waiting
in the apartment next door.

551
00:40:58,170 --> 00:40:59,489
Waiting for what?

552
00:40:59,570 --> 00:41:04,485
For the shower.
That's gonna be our signal.

553
00:41:04,570 --> 00:41:08,688
When he's done with his shower,
you'll go to the bar.

554
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:10,965
You'll get out the Scotch
that Gino drinks.

555
00:41:11,050 --> 00:41:15,282
As you do, the bottle will
slip from your hands:

556
00:41:15,370 --> 00:41:16,849
An accident.

557
00:41:19,090 --> 00:41:21,126
[Ceasar]
Vi, what the hell was that?

558
00:41:21,210 --> 00:41:23,599
Vi, you can't hear me?

559
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:25,123
Oh, fuck!

560
00:41:25,210 --> 00:41:26,689
It slipped.
I was trying to get ready.

561
00:41:26,770 --> 00:41:28,522
How the fuck did you do that?

562
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:30,919
Ceasar, it was an accident.
I didn't mean to.

563
00:41:31,010 --> 00:41:33,763
- I'll get some more.
- There's no fucking time!

564
00:41:33,850 --> 00:41:36,000
Don't be silly.
There's lots of time.

565
00:41:36,090 --> 00:41:37,648
I'll clean this up,
and I'll be back

566
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:40,164
- before you're even dressed.
- Ah, fuck, Vi!

567
00:41:46,530 --> 00:41:49,681
[Corky] When you open
the door, I'll be there.

568
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:57,005
- What if he sees you?
- He won't.

569
00:41:57,090 --> 00:42:00,969
You can't know for certain
that he won't see you.

570
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:04,884
- Trust me.
- I'm just asking, what if?

571
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:07,006
If he does...

572
00:42:08,130 --> 00:42:11,042
then I won't have
a choice, will I?

573
00:42:13,410 --> 00:42:16,686
When I'm inside,
I'll get the money.

574
00:42:56,210 --> 00:42:58,599
I'm going to need something
to fill the case.

575
00:42:58,690 --> 00:43:00,806
Hide it near the desk.

576
00:43:00,890 --> 00:43:02,881
And at that point...

577
00:43:05,770 --> 00:43:08,807
There's no turning back.

578
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:21,849
When I get the Scotch,

579
00:43:21,930 --> 00:43:23,966
how do I know you
won’t just take off?

580
00:43:24,050 --> 00:43:29,283
The same way I'll know that
you got the Scotch: Trust.

581
00:43:29,370 --> 00:43:31,486
I still don't see
how I'll get away clean

582
00:43:31,570 --> 00:43:33,367
with all the money
in the apartment.

583
00:43:33,450 --> 00:43:35,441
Everyone's gonna think
I took it.

584
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:36,849
- Not Ceasar.
- Why?

585
00:43:36,930 --> 00:43:39,046
Because of what
you're gonna tell him.

586
00:43:39,130 --> 00:43:41,166
You gotta be
as real as you can.

587
00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:44,879
When you walk through that door
with the Scotch in your hand,

588
00:43:44,970 --> 00:43:46,881
you'll be covered.

589
00:43:46,970 --> 00:43:50,246
That moment's the most important
moment of the plan.

590
00:43:50,330 --> 00:43:53,208
If you're real enough,
he's gonna believe you

591
00:43:53,290 --> 00:43:55,087
'cause deep down, he'll want to.

592
00:43:55,170 --> 00:43:56,444
Cea!

593
00:43:56,530 --> 00:43:59,522
Shit. I'm sorry.
They were early.

594
00:43:59,610 --> 00:44:02,408
- What are you talking about?
- They just left, didn't they?

595
00:44:02,490 --> 00:44:05,209
- What are you, drunk?
- They weren’t just up here?

596
00:44:05,290 --> 00:44:09,408
- No. They're on their way.
- That doesn't make any sense.

597
00:44:09,490 --> 00:44:11,560
Why?

598
00:44:11,650 --> 00:44:13,959
Well, I just saw
Johnnie downstairs.

599
00:44:17,170 --> 00:44:18,603
- What?
- Yeah.

600
00:44:18,690 --> 00:44:21,079
I got out of my car
and saw him in his BMW.

601
00:44:23,050 --> 00:44:24,927
Nah, it couldn't have been.

602
00:44:25,010 --> 00:44:28,320
It was him, Ceasar.
I'm positive.

603
00:44:28,770 --> 00:44:32,809
- Vi, that's impossible.
- Ceasar, I know Johnnie.

604
00:44:32,890 --> 00:44:34,403
It was him.

605
00:44:34,490 --> 00:44:36,924
I screamed when I saw him. I
couldn't believe I missed them.

606
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:38,363
I knew you were
going to be upset,

607
00:44:38,450 --> 00:44:41,726
so I thought I'd apologise
and give Gino the Scotch.

608
00:44:41,810 --> 00:44:45,644
I honked a few times, but he
didn't hear me and didn't stop.

609
00:44:48,610 --> 00:44:50,965
But...

610
00:44:51,050 --> 00:44:54,201
Gino's plane doesn't get here
for another half-hour.

611
00:44:57,290 --> 00:44:59,326
Actually, I didn't
see Gino in the car.

612
00:45:10,370 --> 00:45:12,804
[Corky] If Ceasar hates
Johnnie as much as you say,

613
00:45:12,890 --> 00:45:14,243
the second he opens the case,

614
00:45:14,330 --> 00:45:17,959
he's gonna know in his gut
that Johnnie just fucked him.

615
00:45:18,050 --> 00:45:19,085
He'll have no choice.

616
00:45:19,170 --> 00:45:21,559
He can't go after
Gino or Johnnie.

617
00:45:21,650 --> 00:45:25,689
There's only one way out.
He'll have to run.

618
00:45:27,490 --> 00:45:32,006
And if he runs, everyone
will assume he took the money.

619
00:45:32,090 --> 00:45:34,888
You'll be clean,
and we'll be rich.

620
00:45:34,970 --> 00:45:38,565
[Violet]
Jesus, that's beautiful.

621
00:45:38,650 --> 00:45:42,359
If you're this goddamn smart,
how did you ever get caught?

622
00:45:42,450 --> 00:45:45,487
I had a partner once.

623
00:45:45,570 --> 00:45:47,765
She fucked me.

624
00:45:48,930 --> 00:45:55,403
- I won't.
- I think we're gonna find out.

625
00:45:59,930 --> 00:46:01,841
- Oh, God...
- Ceasar?

626
00:46:07,610 --> 00:46:08,565
Cea?

627
00:46:10,250 --> 00:46:12,559
Oh, no. Oh!

628
00:46:12,690 --> 00:46:14,282
Oh, God.

629
00:46:15,370 --> 00:46:17,281
Ahhh...

630
00:46:18,010 --> 00:46:20,399
Vi...

631
00:46:20,490 --> 00:46:23,607
- Vi, I've been set up.
- Johnnie?

632
00:46:23,690 --> 00:46:25,920
That fuck.

633
00:46:26,010 --> 00:46:28,649

That motherless rat fuck!

635
00:46:31,250 --> 00:46:34,481
Why? Why would Johnnie do this?

636
00:46:38,250 --> 00:46:41,959
Jesus Christ, Violet,
open your fucking eyes.

637
00:46:42,050 --> 00:46:45,599
Johnnie hates me
as much as I hate him.

638
00:46:45,690 --> 00:46:47,328
I hate that motherless
rat fucker. I hate him.

639
00:46:47,410 --> 00:46:49,162
I fucking hate him. I hate him.

640
00:46:49,250 --> 00:46:52,765
- But you know he did it.
- Yeah, so what?

641
00:46:52,850 --> 00:46:54,966
Violet, so fucking what?

642
00:46:55,050 --> 00:46:58,884
Look, the money is gone, right?

643
00:46:58,970 --> 00:47:00,562
Gino's coming to get it.

644
00:47:00,650 --> 00:47:02,959
Now, do you think Gino
is going to believe me

645
00:47:03,050 --> 00:47:05,405
when I tell him his
little rat-fuck son stole it?

646
00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:07,958
Is that what you think?
Because I don't.

647
00:47:08,050 --> 00:47:09,278
You know what I think?

648
00:47:09,370 --> 00:47:10,723
I think I'm a dead man.

649
00:47:10,810 --> 00:47:14,405
I'm one in the back of the head.
That's what I think.

650
00:47:15,650 --> 00:47:16,969
Ceasar, what are we going to do?

651
00:47:17,050 --> 00:47:19,564
Well, I know what Johnnie
wants me to do.

652
00:47:19,650 --> 00:47:22,403
Johnnie wants me to run.
He wants me out of here.

653
00:47:22,490 --> 00:47:25,368
But if I run, then everybody
thinks I fucking did it,

654
00:47:25,450 --> 00:47:28,408
and he gets away
with 2 million clean.

655
00:47:29,450 --> 00:47:31,645
I can see him right now,

656
00:47:31,730 --> 00:47:33,846
on the way to get Gino,
laughing at me.

657
00:47:33,930 --> 00:47:35,079
Laughing at me. Laughing at me!

658
00:47:35,170 --> 00:47:37,240
Laughing at me! Laughing at me!

659
00:47:37,330 --> 00:47:40,128
Fucking laughing at me!

- Cea, Cea...
- Don't, Violet, please.

661
00:47:42,770 --> 00:47:43,964
Don't touch me, OK?

662
00:47:44,050 --> 00:47:46,883
I gotta think. I gotta
fucking think this through!

663
00:47:46,970 --> 00:47:49,359
- Ceasar...
- No. No, Vi.

664
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:51,406
I think we should run.
We should go.

665
00:47:51,490 --> 00:47:53,048
We have to go now
before it's too late.

666
00:47:53,130 --> 00:47:55,564
No, please, Violet,
leave me alone!

667
00:47:55,650 --> 00:47:57,447
Please! All right?

668
00:47:57,530 --> 00:48:01,079
Just leave me the fuck alone!

669
00:48:02,970 --> 00:48:05,086
All right, Ceasar.

670
00:48:06,090 --> 00:48:08,046
I-I-I just, I got
to think. That's all.

671
00:48:08,130 --> 00:48:10,644
I-I-I just got to think.

- It's me.
- What happened?

677
00:48:35,250 --> 00:48:38,401
He totally freaked out.
I've never seen him like this.

678
00:48:38,490 --> 00:48:40,048
He's out of his fucking mind.

679
00:48:40,130 --> 00:48:42,690
[Corky] All right, as long
as he believes it was Johnnie.

680
00:48:42,770 --> 00:48:47,286
Believes it? Jesus.
It's driving him crazy.

681
00:48:47,370 --> 00:48:49,679
He wants to kill him.

682
00:48:49,770 --> 00:48:51,522
I don't know, Corky.
I don't know.

683
00:48:51,610 --> 00:48:53,680
I'm getting nervous.
I'm getting really nervous.

684
00:48:53,770 --> 00:48:55,169
I don't know
what he's gonna do.

685
00:48:55,250 --> 00:48:57,684
It's all right, Violet.
It's working.

686
00:48:57,770 --> 00:49:00,728
All we gotta do is wait him out
and see what he does.

687
00:49:00,810 --> 00:49:03,608
[Violet] What if he doesn't run?

688
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:05,442
That means he'll
probably kill Johnnie.

689
00:49:05,530 --> 00:49:08,090
[Violet] Oh, Christ.
I have to get out of here.

690
00:49:08,170 --> 00:49:09,285
Listen.

691
00:49:09,370 --> 00:49:12,567
If he doesn't run,
all you gotta do is break down.

692
00:49:12,650 --> 00:49:15,369
Go into the bedroom
and pack some things.

693
00:49:15,450 --> 00:49:17,918
Start crying. Tell him you
love him, but you can't take it.

694
00:49:18,010 --> 00:49:21,685
You're sorry, but you
gotta leave. Just walk out.

695
00:49:21,770 --> 00:49:23,522
All right. OK.

696
00:49:23,610 --> 00:49:25,760
[Corky] We're almost there.
Just hang on.

[Footsteps]

698
00:49:26,850 --> 00:49:28,568
He's coming.

699
00:49:30,290 --> 00:49:32,201
I got it.
I know what I have to do.

700
00:49:32,290 --> 00:49:36,363
- I have to get the money back.
- The money? The money's gone.

701
00:49:36,450 --> 00:49:39,601
No, no, no. Johnnie's got it.
I gotta get it back.

702
00:49:39,690 --> 00:49:41,043
But it could be anywhere.

703
00:49:41,130 --> 00:49:43,439
There's not enough time,
Violet.

704
00:49:43,530 --> 00:49:45,964
Johnnie's picking up
Gino at the airport, right?

705
00:49:46,050 --> 00:49:47,688
[Muffled] That means he's
probably got the money with him.

706
00:49:47,770 --> 00:49:49,840
He's probably got it in the car.

707
00:49:49,930 --> 00:49:51,329
He didn't see you, did he?

708
00:49:51,410 --> 00:49:55,369
- No.
- Good.

709
00:49:55,450 --> 00:49:57,520
That's good.

710
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:02,086
So that means I got the edge.

711
00:50:02,170 --> 00:50:04,730
He doesn't know I know.

712
00:50:07,210 --> 00:50:10,486
That's why he put
the paper in the case.

713
00:50:10,570 --> 00:50:14,119
He wants me to hand it to Gino.

714
00:50:14,210 --> 00:50:17,725
Then there's no doubt I did it.

715
00:50:17,810 --> 00:50:20,608
Gino will put a bullet
in me himself.

716
00:50:22,170 --> 00:50:24,638
But that's not gonna happen.

717
00:50:27,690 --> 00:50:30,807
That jackoff's not gonna set
me up. No way, not like this.

718
00:50:32,330 --> 00:50:34,480
This is insane.

719
00:50:38,690 --> 00:50:41,329
What are you doing?

720
00:50:41,410 --> 00:50:44,163
I'm leaving. I don't want
any part of this shit.

I don't wanna be involved.

722
00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:48,366
- You can't leave.
- The hell I can't.

723
00:50:50,210 --> 00:50:51,962
I need you.

724
00:50:52,050 --> 00:50:55,679
You don't need me.
You've never needed me.

725
00:50:55,770 --> 00:50:57,681
I can't help you. Understand?

726
00:51:06,090 --> 00:51:09,082
I can't let you leave, Violet.

727
00:51:09,170 --> 00:51:12,048
If you're not with me
I assume you're against me.

729

Maybe it is, maybe it isn't.

730
00:51:20,290 --> 00:51:22,406
Maybe you dropped that bottle
of Scotch by accident.

731
00:51:22,490 --> 00:51:23,843
Maybe you didn't.

732

It would have been so easy

733
00:51:26,610 --> 00:51:29,966
to let him in as you left.

734
00:51:31,610 --> 00:51:32,759
You can't believe that.

I've seen the way
he looks at you.

He's always wanted you.

Maybe 2 million bucks
finally bought you.

I'm sorry, Violet.

to know one thing.

Oh, no, no, no!

Hey, Violet, you remember these?

I'm gonna ask you 10 questions.

I don't get an answer...

All right. I'll tell you.

It's in the apartment

- I put it in the paint drums.
- Good.

01:23:22,690 --> 01:23:26,285
Now, I promised you
I would kill you. Remember?

01:23:26,370 --> 01:23:30,921
- You can't kill me.
- Oh, really? Why not?

- It was busted up... bad.
- What?

maybe it's about the money.

is the busy signal.

was helping me relax,

maybe.

Oh, God, Mickey,
he made me do it.

1286
01:34:22,850 --> 01:34:25,808
I was so afraid!
I didn't want to, Mickey.

1287
01:34:25,890 --> 01:34:28,358
It was Ceasar, all Ceasar.
He made me help him.

1288
01:34:28,450 --> 01:34:30,122
You have to help me.

It's over, Ceasar.

I called Mickey.
He's on his way.

Get out of here, Ceasar.

1297
01:36:11,130 --> 01:36:13,690
If you want to live,
you better start running.

1298
01:36:15,690 --> 01:36:18,250
All these years, Vi,
and you still don't know me...

- But I know you.
- Ceasar, don't.

01:36:25,770 --> 01:36:28,807
What are you going to do
with that, Vi? Shoot me?

1301
01:36:28,890 --> 01:36:33,441
Kill me in cold blood?
I don't think so.

1302
01:36:33,530 --> 01:36:35,919
If you were going to
shoot me, Vi,

1303
01:36:36,010 --> 01:36:37,523
you'd have done it
a long time ago.

1304
01:36:37,610 --> 01:36:40,204
If I were you, I'd have shot me

back to the apartment,

1306

but you didn't,
and I'll tell you why.

You don't want to shoot me, Vi.

Ceasar, you don't know shit.

1312

[Violet] I'll never
understand it, Mickey.

1313
01:37:49,890 --> 01:37:51,243
You didn't even call the police.

1314
01:37:51,330 --> 01:37:55,084
I told you. The family
doesn't want the police around.

1315

We want to take care of it
ourselves and we will.

Thanks, Mickey, but...

1323
01:38:17,970 --> 01:38:19,449
I have to get out.

1324
01:38:19,530 --> 01:38:23,239
You know, I have to get away
from all this.
