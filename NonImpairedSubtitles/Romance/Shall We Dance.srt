1
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:34,630
A million and a half people
ride the El trains every day.

2
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:39,570
Over 20 years, I've written wills
for about 8.000 of 'em.

3
00:00:40,573 --> 00:00:43,701
I've sat with 'em as they've
combed through their assets.

4
00:00:43,777 --> 00:00:47,076
Figured out which kid gets
the painting over the fireplace,

5
00:00:47,147 --> 00:00:51,049
which one gets the
antique spoon collection.

6
00:00:51,117 --> 00:00:57,317
Last thanks, parting shots, confessions...
People try to fit it all in.

7
00:00:59,692 --> 00:01:03,788
And once I've finished,
another life has been summed up -

8
00:01:03,863 --> 00:01:07,526
assets and debts tallied,
then zeroed out.

9
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,967
You initial here and there,
you sign at the bottom...

10
00:01:11,037 --> 00:01:14,871
then, If you're like most clients,
you look up, smile,

11
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:20,379
and you ask the question I've heard
for 20 years: "Is that it, then?"

12
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:27,049
"That's it for the paperwork", I tell 'em.
"The rest is up to you."

13
00:01:27,821 --> 00:01:34,090
♪ Happy birthday to you,
Happy birthday to you

14
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:40,190
♪ Happy birthday, dear Dad
Happy birthday to you

15
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:43,099
Ohh, wow. Beautiful.

16
00:01:43,169 --> 00:01:44,761
All right, make a wish.

17
00:01:48,575 --> 00:01:50,475
Sorry. I just have
to take this call.

18
00:01:50,543 --> 00:01:53,307
- Did you win?
- "Take this call"?

19
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:57,645
- She's 14. How can she be "taking calls"?
- Jen, not now. Now's not the time.

20
00:01:57,717 --> 00:02:00,515
Remind me, why was it we agreed
to give her the phone?

21
00:02:00,587 --> 00:02:02,646
- Emergencies.
- Which this is, by the way.

22
00:02:02,722 --> 00:02:04,656
Serious problem over there.

23
00:02:04,724 --> 00:02:06,624
Get off, Jen.
Now, please. Come on.

24
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:08,456
- All right!
- Come on, get off.

25
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:13,397
Yeah, my dad's just gonna blow out
about a million candles. Bye.

26
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:16,958
All right, everyone,
are we all happy now?

27
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:22,606
Thank you. Thank you.

28
00:02:22,675 --> 00:02:26,111
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you.

29
00:02:29,415 --> 00:02:32,111
- Sorry about the bathrobe.
- What do you mean?

30
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:35,154
Oh, I just had such a hard time
getting you a present.

31
00:02:35,221 --> 00:02:36,415
I love this bathrobe.

32
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:39,686
I think the problem is that
you never really want anything.

33
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:41,226
- That's not true.
- That's true.

34
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:44,024
- Tell me one thing that you really want.
- What you gave me tonight.

35
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:47,066
Evan coming home, everyone's
at dinner, that cake you make...

36
00:02:47,133 --> 00:02:51,399
Tell me one thing that you want
that comes in a box.

37
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:55,503
I rest my case.

38
00:03:06,786 --> 00:03:11,018
Yes! That's it! That's it!
That's what we needed.

39
00:03:15,895 --> 00:03:18,762
Good night, Mary.
I left the Anderson will on your desk.

40
00:03:18,831 --> 00:03:20,822
Night, Bill.

41
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:52,157
Next stop. Sedgwick.

42
00:03:52,932 --> 00:03:56,060
Hello. I'm home.

43
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:05,070
There's a female bonding ritual
going on in the den.

44
00:04:05,144 --> 00:04:06,805
- I know.
- What are they doing in there?

45
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:10,246
Tattooing "I love Satan" on their foreheads,
piercing their bellybuttons, stuff like that.

46
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:14,047
- Great. What did you say about that?
- I said, "Don't get any blood on the couch."

47
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,146
I worry about Jenna. She's
too beautiful. That's your fault.

48
00:04:17,223 --> 00:04:18,747
- Here, sign this.
- What is it?

49
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:21,020
- It's your mom's birthday card.
- Oh, God, thank you.

50
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:23,824
- How was your workout?
- Same. How are you?

51
00:04:23,896 --> 00:04:27,457
Fine. You know, ordering the
spring line at the store, yada-yada.

52
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:30,969
- I've got to get going.
- I thought you just got here.

53
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:33,471
Yeah, but it's the fundraiser
at Jen's school.

54
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:36,337
So your dinner's in the oven
and the girls have already eaten.

55
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:40,004
Can we go see a movie sometime?

56
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:44,948
Yeah. Or at least we could
look at the ads in the paper together.

57
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:50,282
How are you doing?

58
00:04:50,356 --> 00:04:52,347
Fine.

59
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:57,725
Check on them now and then, OK?

60
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:59,958
Don't wait up.

61
00:05:06,172 --> 00:05:08,902
Get out of here, Dad!

62
00:06:24,283 --> 00:06:28,379
Bev? It's not true
that I don't want anything.

63
00:06:34,026 --> 00:06:35,994
Bev?

64
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:08,888
Doors open on the right.

65
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:20,299
- Doors closing. Next stop, Sedgwick.</i>
- Excuse me.

66
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:35,114
Oh, my God. What are you doing?
What are you doing?

67
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:42,325
You know what?
I'm gonna just go up.

68
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:48,327
Oh, my God.

69
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,942
That was a great class.

70
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,371
Come on.

71
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:06,145
- Are we goin' up, or what?
- I'm just trying to...

72
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:08,153
Here.

73
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:10,789
- OK, don't do that.
- Do what?

74
00:08:10,857 --> 00:08:14,258
Stand there looking dumb.
It's just not cute in a guy your age.

75
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,488
Be a doll and help me
carry my clothes.

76
00:08:16,562 --> 00:08:19,827
Come on.
And stop lookin' at my ass.

77
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:22,292
I'll try.

78
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:26,332
T... A... N-G-O...

79
00:08:26,772 --> 00:08:30,139
T... A... N-G-O...

80
00:08:30,476 --> 00:08:34,242
T... A... N-G... Oh!

81
00:08:34,313 --> 00:08:37,749
- I found him at the bottom of the stairs.
- Um... Uh...

82
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:40,513
Paulina, could you help?

83
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:42,850
Excuse me.

84
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:51,287
May I help you?

85
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,659
The sign said
"Feel free to watch."

86
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:57,100
Are you here for lessons?

87
00:08:58,004 --> 00:08:59,403
Yes.

88
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:03,107
- Mr...?
- Clark.

89
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:06,573
Are you registering
as a couple or as a single?

90
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:09,206
Single. I mean, not that I'm...

91
00:09:12,084 --> 00:09:14,314
Single. Yeah, just me.

92
00:09:16,989 --> 00:09:21,483
Single privates are $45 an hour. If you buy
six at a time, the price per class drops $5.

93
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:25,395
- Have you ever danced before?
- No. No. But I'm a fast learner.

94
00:09:25,464 --> 00:09:27,591
We're starting a new intro
ballroom series for singles.

95
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:30,693
I recommend that beginners start with that.
There's still room in the class.

96
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:34,536
It meets every Wednesday
at 7:30, for eight weeks.

97
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:36,632
All right.

98
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:40,712
Right, Wednesdays, 7:30. Great.

99
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,272
Great. Well...

100
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:47,951
- I'll come back then. Thank you.
- Mr. Clark?

101
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:52,150
Where are you going?
The class starts tonight.

102
00:09:52,224 --> 00:09:53,851
Tonight?

103
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:56,622
Oh, right, yeah.
Wednesday, 7:30.

104
00:09:56,696 --> 00:09:59,756
You can wait over there.
We'll begin shortly.

105
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:04,199
OK...

106
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:24,815
Hey. I'm Vern.

107
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:26,448
John.

108
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:32,721
- You beginning ballroom?
- Yeah, looks that way. Yeah.

109
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:35,130
- Chic. Hey.
- Hey.

110
00:10:43,943 --> 00:10:46,104
So, you dance much?

111
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:51,579
High-school prom.
"Stairway to Heaven."

112
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:56,413
- You?
- Not even a prom. I didn't go.

113
00:10:56,489 --> 00:11:02,519
Anybody see any girls?
I mean, I'm here for the babes, right.

114
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:04,995
I mean, it can't be just us, can it?

115
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:11,459
Guys dancin' with guys ain't my kinda
thing, you know? No offense, sir.

116
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:14,965
None taken.

117
00:11:20,212 --> 00:11:21,873
Hi.

118
00:11:22,481 --> 00:11:26,975
See the slinky one with the eyebrows?
That's me - if you don't mind.

119
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:29,283
I know you</i> won't mind.

120
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:33,191
- Be my guest.
- All right.

121
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:37,521
Work the goods.

122
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:42,467
Oh, yeah. Here they come.
Come to Papa.

123
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,594
Here they...

124
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:47,327
Ouch.

125
00:11:47,406 --> 00:11:51,035
Memories of high school, huh, boys?

126
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:15,693
Good evening, gentlemen, and
welcome to the beginner's ballroom class.

127
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:19,397
My name is Miss Mitzi. I am the owner
of this dancing establishment,

128
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:22,532
and I am going to be your teacher.
Disappointed that I'm older?

129
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:24,940
Yes. I mean, no. I mean...

130
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:27,342
Hey, you look... experienced.

131
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:31,941
Forward, side, closed...
Back, side, close.

132
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:36,680
Very good, Chic.
Is it "Chick," or "Sheek"?

133
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,724
- Whoa! "Chick."
- "Chick."

134
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:40,190
- Yes. Very good.
- Easy.

135
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:42,693
Remember to use
the balls of your feet.

136
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,787
Wait a minute, Vern.
Where is your right foot?

137
00:12:44,864 --> 00:12:48,129
- It's right back there. See?
- Yes, I know. It hasn't moved, has it?

138
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,428
Not yet.

139
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:51,527
- Well, now would be a good time.
- OK.

140
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:54,038
- OK? Close.
- Close...

141
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:56,370
Excellent. Very good.

142
00:12:56,442 --> 00:13:01,812
All right. Forward, side, close.
Back, side, close.

143
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:04,543
One, two, three, rise.

144
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:08,383
- Hey, hey, hey!
- You guys saw that?

145
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:11,423
Excellent, gentlemen.
Excellent.

146
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:16,123
Keep your sticks up.
Promenade.

147
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:19,392
- And...
- Counter-promenade.

148
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:21,433
Let me see what you're doing. Ah!

149
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,128
- Miss Mitzi, I'm sorry. Sorry.
- God! Jesus!

150
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:26,137
- I said I'm sorry.
- Put the stick down.

151
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:29,436
We're not gonna play with these sticks
anymore if you boys won't behave.

152
00:13:29,508 --> 00:13:32,705
A little faster this time. And...

153
00:13:32,778 --> 00:13:36,646
Heel, toe, toe-toe,
toe, heel, toe-toe.

154
00:13:36,715 --> 00:13:39,513
Excuse me. When we go forward,
is it heel-toe or toe...

155
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:41,815
It's forward, heel, toe, toe...

156
00:13:41,887 --> 00:13:44,515
So it's back... Whoa...

157
00:13:53,532 --> 00:13:56,831
Harder than it looks,
isn't it, gentlemen?

158
00:13:56,902 --> 00:13:59,962
Well, you've all done very very well
for your first lesson.

159
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:01,597
And before you leave tonight,

160
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:05,735
I'm gonna give you a little incentive
to keep on dancing.

161
00:14:05,811 --> 00:14:07,176
Paulina?

162
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:11,546
Would you and Francesco mind giving
our new students a little demonstration?

163
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:13,744
Certainly, Miss Mitzi.

164
00:14:13,819 --> 00:14:15,980
Daphne?

165
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:27,054
Thank you, Paulina.

166
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:32,789
Whoo! Whoo!

167
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:36,300
That was beautiful.

168
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:40,668
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm good.

169
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,172
Hey, guys, wait up.
I'm comin'.

170
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:46,734
Great. How lucky for us.

171
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:48,006
- Hey.
- Where are we goin'?

172
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,048
- Somewhere close.
- Yeah. I haven't got long.

173
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:51,605
Anyway. You guys.
Don't go to Jim's.

174
00:15:51,684 --> 00:15:54,084
They got a bad roach problem
there around the corner.

175
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:57,589
You're gonna go anywhere after class,
you come here, OK? Thank you.

176
00:15:57,656 --> 00:15:59,317
Why'd you guys decide
to take dance, anyway?

177
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:01,951
- I'm gettin' married in September.
- Nice.

178
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:04,689
Yeah. My bride said she'd like
to see me lose a few pounds.

179
00:16:04,763 --> 00:16:08,164
She thinks the dancing will help.
I said it won't.

180
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:11,634
- I think you'll win that argument.
- I'm taking classes to impress the ladies.

181
00:16:11,704 --> 00:16:13,501
You know what they say
about guys who can dance, right?

182
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:15,540
- That they're great in bed.
- Yeah, baby.

183
00:16:15,607 --> 00:16:19,065
- Where do you get that stupid crap?
- Everywhere. What do you think?

184
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:22,671
Everybody knows a guy who can move
on the dance floor can move in the sack.

185
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:26,411
Most guys, they can't dance at all. Guys
who can, they get their pick of the litter.

186
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:29,010
That's why, when I'm done with this class,
babes will drop at my feet.

187
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:31,147
They're gonna be droppin'
dead</i> at your feet.

188
00:16:31,223 --> 00:16:35,489
When you took your shoes off in class
today, I had to run to the window for air.

189
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:38,496
What kind of person says something like
that to somebody they don't even know?

190
00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:40,293
Hey, man, I'm doin' you a favor.

191
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:43,164
I'm telling you something obnoxious about
yourself that you might not be aware of.

192
00:16:43,235 --> 00:16:45,669
If there's something obnoxious about me
that you don't think I'm aware of,

193
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:49,640
y'all should feel free to say
something about it to me.

194
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:52,567
Shooting fish in a barrel.

195
00:16:52,644 --> 00:16:55,579
- Where are all the ladies, anyways?
- I don't know what I'm talking about.

196
00:16:55,647 --> 00:16:58,377
The ladies, they all go and take
the classes down at Doctor Dance -

197
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:02,648
that's, like, the hip place to go downtown.
Ditzy Mitzi's is only hangin' on by a thread.

198
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:06,418
Only reason I go there is she lets me
rehearse whenever I want for free.

199
00:17:06,492 --> 00:17:09,757
I'm gonna compete in the
Chicago Taittinger Trophy.

200
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:12,228
Soon as I find a partner.

201
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:16,233
So... that leaves you.

202
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:19,098
Leaves me? How? What?

203
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:22,436
Leaves you as the only one here
who hasn't said why he's dancing yet.

204
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:25,500
Oh. Well, I'm dancing
for exercise, like Vern.

205
00:17:25,577 --> 00:17:26,669
Bull.

206
00:17:26,745 --> 00:17:29,578
Because I'm lousy in bed, like Chic.
There, I've said it.

207
00:17:29,648 --> 00:17:33,448
- That is bull! I didn't say I was bad in bed.
- You didn't have to.

208
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:35,510
Come on, why?

209
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:39,051
Is there any pepper here?
Could I have some?

210
00:17:39,124 --> 00:17:41,524
That's what I thought.

211
00:17:41,593 --> 00:17:44,118
She was a Blackpool finalist, you know.

212
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:45,185
Who?

213
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:48,131
The princess.
The other teacher, Paulina.

214
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,327
What's Blackpool?

215
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:52,666
Every year, all the best dancers
from all over the world...

216
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:56,697
go to England to compete there.
She was there last year with her partner -

217
00:17:56,775 --> 00:17:59,608
who they say was much more to her
than just her partner.

218
00:17:59,678 --> 00:18:02,374
Anyway, he dumped her. That's the only
reason she came back here to teach -

219
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:04,541
mad at the world,
boo-hoo-hoo and all that.

220
00:18:04,616 --> 00:18:06,049
- Why'd he dump her?
- Yeah.

221
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:10,817
How the hell should I know?
God, they say women gossip! Golly!

222
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:37,111
Hello? I'm home.

223
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:59,870
Great. Great, Vern.
Slow. The mambo is slow.

224
00:18:59,938 --> 00:19:01,667
Slide that hand one inch
south of the equator...

225
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:04,300
and I will bust you on your ass,
twinkle-toes.

226
00:19:04,376 --> 00:19:09,370
Let's get something straight. I don't like
the tropics any more than you do, OK?

227
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:27,056
Five, six, seven, eight...</i>

228
00:19:27,132 --> 00:19:30,397
Arms. And basic.
And cross over.

229
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:32,667
Right.

230
00:19:32,738 --> 00:19:35,298
One more time,
and walk around.

231
00:19:36,241 --> 00:19:39,210
- And basic.
- Watch out.

232
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:41,439
And big ending.

233
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:52,588
Look at you, John!

234
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:04,902
- That was pretty good.
- You were really good.

235
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,757
Hey, I'm sorry I'm late.
I'm gonna go up and change.

236
00:20:35,834 --> 00:20:37,859
Right.

237
00:20:37,936 --> 00:20:41,667
- Dad work late tonight?
- Yeah, looks that way.

238
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:46,604
Guess whatever he's working on,
he must like it.

239
00:20:46,678 --> 00:20:50,671
- Why do you say that?
- He seems happier lately.

240
00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:56,279
Does he?

241
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:03,387
I called the Halston people
in New York.

242
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:07,023
We're gonna have trouble getting more
stock in. Everything's on back-order.

243
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:10,557
Look, Carolyn, I'm gonna need you
to go to New York and sweet-talk them.

244
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:13,127
- Can you leave tomorrow?
- No.

245
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:15,264
Why not?

246
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:18,275
My husband is having an affair.

247
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,614
How do you know that?

248
00:21:23,682 --> 00:21:26,446
I picked up the receiver last night
to phone a friend,

249
00:21:26,518 --> 00:21:31,683
not knowing that Greg was already
on the other line in the den.

250
00:21:31,757 --> 00:21:33,782
He was whispering.

251
00:21:34,526 --> 00:21:36,551
What was he whispering?

252
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:38,721
I don't know.

253
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:42,358
I was so scared I hung up
before I could hear anything.

254
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:46,370
Well, there's lots of other reasons
why he could be whispering.

255
00:21:46,438 --> 00:21:50,875
I mean, maybe he didn't wanna
wake up the kids. Huh?

256
00:21:50,942 --> 00:21:56,539
Or he could be planning a surprise for you.
I mean, your birthday's coming up, isn't it?

257
00:21:58,617 --> 00:22:01,347
In two weeks.

258
00:22:06,391 --> 00:22:08,484
That's it.

259
00:22:11,296 --> 00:22:15,596
Take a breath, go get yourself a brownie
in the kitchen, just chill. It's gonna be fine.

260
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:17,658
OK.

261
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:21,164
- Euh!
- Ooh-hoo-hoo!

262
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:23,605
You silly goose, you.

263
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:28,271
She'll be divorced by Easter.

264
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:42,351
Come on, John.
Join the warm-up.

265
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:22,522
Ow!

266
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:25,593
- Jesus! I'm sorry!
- Watch your floorcraft, spasmo!

267
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:29,162
What, you think you own this floor? I'll
have a bruise the size of Texas tomorrow!

268
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:31,709
- Go away!
- Go away? You go away!

269
00:23:31,777 --> 00:23:34,678
Take your stupid music with you!
I can't dance to that crap.

270
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:37,943
You just gonna stand there
and let that fat cow insult you?

271
00:23:38,016 --> 00:23:42,976
- I'm sorry, what did you say?
- Nothing. She didn't say anything.

272
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:56,567
Sorry. These are the teeth
I wear for the Latin.

273
00:23:56,635 --> 00:23:59,570
It gets your smile out there.
Just a little bit bigger smile.

274
00:23:59,638 --> 00:24:02,471
Bam! Gets the judges right
in the eye, catches the light.

275
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:04,202
And then the make-up -
you know the make-up.

276
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:07,302
"Swish-butt," "Fancy pants,"
"Pinky boy"...

277
00:24:07,379 --> 00:24:10,610
All these names, all these names I've been
called ever since I was eight years old...

278
00:24:10,682 --> 00:24:13,776
and dancing around
to my mother's rumba records.

279
00:24:13,852 --> 00:24:16,616
You know what
the worst of it is? Huh?

280
00:24:17,722 --> 00:24:21,988
I'm not gay. Can you imagine how much
easier my life would be if I were?

281
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:24,187
I mean, a straight man who likes
to dance around in sequins...

282
00:24:24,262 --> 00:24:26,958
walks a very lonely road.
I got news for you.

283
00:24:27,032 --> 00:24:28,966
Look, you're not gonna
tell anybody in the office, are you?

284
00:24:29,034 --> 00:24:32,526
No, no, no. I wouldn't do that.
Look, I'm in the same boat, aren't I?

285
00:24:32,604 --> 00:24:34,196
No, you're not. You're not.

286
00:24:34,272 --> 00:24:36,832
- Why not?
- Because... people like you.

287
00:24:36,908 --> 00:24:38,603
You know what I mean?
You're charming.

288
00:24:38,677 --> 00:24:42,773
I'm Linky Link. They would
crucify me if they found out.

289
00:24:42,848 --> 00:24:46,284
I'm the sports trivia king,
I'm the super sports fan, you know?

290
00:24:46,351 --> 00:24:49,514
- You don't like football?
- I... You know.

291
00:24:49,588 --> 00:24:52,648
Run three yards, fall down, pile up.
Run three yards, fall down, pile up.

292
00:24:52,724 --> 00:24:56,160
I mean, you know, four months of that,
I'm ready to put a gun to my head.

293
00:24:56,228 --> 00:24:59,425
- Fooled me.
- I know. I fooled everybody.

294
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:01,329
You know what my dream is?

295
00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:03,230
What?

296
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:09,935
My dream... is to be able
to dance free and proud.

297
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:13,102
Under my own name.
For all the world to see.

298
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:15,408
That's my dream.

299
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,243
Did I get it all?

300
00:25:23,255 --> 00:25:24,517
Hey, Andy. It's Bev.

301
00:25:24,589 --> 00:25:27,922
Look, I'm sorry to call you so late.
I was just trying to find John.

302
00:25:27,993 --> 00:25:33,625
Called the office at six and Betsy said
that he'd left for the day, and I was just...

303
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:36,758
You got home by five?
How did you manage that, you lucky dog?

304
00:25:36,835 --> 00:25:40,396
Ah, there's the door.
OK. See you. Bye.

305
00:25:40,472 --> 00:25:42,201
Sorry I'm late.
I got hung up at the office.

306
00:25:42,274 --> 00:25:45,072
I wish you'd call, 'cause we were looking
all over for your car keys forever...

307
00:25:45,143 --> 00:25:48,044
- I thought you were shopping with Jenna.
- That was weeks ago.

308
00:25:48,113 --> 00:25:50,980
I called the office and Betsy said
you left for the day at six.

309
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:52,983
Yeah, I did - for a sandwich.
Then I came back.

310
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:56,077
Oh. Well, I called your private line
a few times, nobody picked up.

311
00:25:56,154 --> 00:25:58,418
That's because I wasn't working
in my office, I was in Andy's.

312
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:00,117
Oh. How is Andy?

313
00:26:00,191 --> 00:26:04,423
We're working on a really big
estate plan together.

314
00:26:04,496 --> 00:26:06,896
- So he was there?
- What?

315
00:26:06,965 --> 00:26:08,626
Was Andy there?

316
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,429
Why are you asking me
all these questions?

317
00:26:10,502 --> 00:26:12,436
I don't know.

318
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:17,770
Anyway, I stopped off for a bite
on the way home with Link Peterson.

319
00:26:17,842 --> 00:26:20,436
Remember him?
Interesting guy.

320
00:26:21,112 --> 00:26:23,842
Not what you'd think.

321
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:26,315
- How was your day?
- Great.

322
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:37,486
One, two, three, four...

323
00:26:38,797 --> 00:26:41,163
One, two, three...

324
00:26:57,949 --> 00:26:59,416
Mom?

325
00:27:00,085 --> 00:27:02,417
Dad's acting weird.

326
00:27:10,195 --> 00:27:15,394
They met five years ago
in a chat room for gardeners.

327
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:20,066
He says they're in love.

328
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:23,137
He's moving out Saturday.

329
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:26,234
He'll be back.
He loves those kids.

330
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:28,370
I thought we were happy.

331
00:27:28,446 --> 00:27:30,710
He seemed happy to me.

332
00:27:31,916 --> 00:27:34,441
I didn't know anything.

333
00:27:36,254 --> 00:27:37,881
I didn't know.

334
00:27:46,698 --> 00:27:48,757
Oh...

335
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:50,892
Hi.

336
00:27:50,969 --> 00:27:55,997
I, uh... I give free consultations
during my lunch hour.

337
00:27:56,074 --> 00:27:58,474
You sure you don't
wanna come in?

338
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:01,175
So he comes home late
on Wednesdays,

339
00:28:01,246 --> 00:28:03,214
and when he comes home
his shirts smell like perfume.

340
00:28:03,281 --> 00:28:06,546
He's been seen making strange body
movements and you feel he has a secret.

341
00:28:06,618 --> 00:28:09,212
- That's correct.
- Ever think about just asking him?

342
00:28:09,287 --> 00:28:12,848
- Yes, I've thought about it...
- Mrs. Clark...

343
00:28:12,924 --> 00:28:17,258
things happen in long marriages.
To the best of people.

344
00:28:17,328 --> 00:28:20,229
And sometimes the thing that happens
doesn't mean anything.

345
00:28:20,298 --> 00:28:23,199
Doesn't need an investigator, just needs
somebody to look the other way for a while.

346
00:28:23,268 --> 00:28:27,830
My husband is a serious man, Mr. Devine.
If he's having an affair, it is not casual.

347
00:28:27,906 --> 00:28:30,602
In which case,
the sooner I know, the better.

348
00:28:32,277 --> 00:28:36,111
All right. Give me a moment while
I call in my associate, Mr. Harcourt.

349
00:28:36,181 --> 00:28:38,172
Scottie!

350
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:41,314
Scottie Harcourt,
this is Mrs. Clark.

351
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:43,786
She suspects
her husband's up to no good.

352
00:28:43,855 --> 00:28:48,189
"To catch a husband is an art.
To hold him is a job."

353
00:28:48,259 --> 00:28:51,751
Simone de Beauvoir said that.
It's very nice to meet you, Mrs. Clark.

354
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:52,819
Same here.

355
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:55,889
I think we can start this investigation
without too much cost to Mrs. Clark.

356
00:28:55,967 --> 00:29:01,098
Yes. Follow that husband around for a few
days, take some pictures, see what's up.

357
00:29:01,172 --> 00:29:02,935
But I have to warn you,
if it goes to trial it's gonna be...

358
00:29:03,007 --> 00:29:05,237
Trial?

359
00:29:06,544 --> 00:29:09,012
In the event of a divorce.

360
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,877
But we don't know if
he's having an affair.

361
00:29:10,949 --> 00:29:16,182
I mean, he could just be
involved with... I don't know...

362
00:29:17,155 --> 00:29:20,124
people who get together
to invest things,

363
00:29:20,191 --> 00:29:26,027
and... and the place that they
invest things is... filled with potpourri,

364
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:31,228
and that's why his shirts smell so sweet
when he comes home. It's possible.

365
00:29:31,302 --> 00:29:33,600
Yeah, it's possible.
It's possible.

366
00:29:33,671 --> 00:29:38,335
It's possible we could find your husband
neck-deep in potpourri, investing things.

367
00:29:38,409 --> 00:29:40,400
Not likely.

368
00:29:44,482 --> 00:29:47,076
Look, this is what we'll do.

369
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:51,684
We start out gently.

370
00:29:56,161 --> 00:29:58,186
We look for the potpourri.

371
00:29:58,263 --> 00:30:03,758
And if we find it, and it smells like flowers,
then 2,000 ought to cover my time.

372
00:30:03,835 --> 00:30:08,135
But if we find the potpourri and there's
something big and stinky in the pot,

373
00:30:08,206 --> 00:30:11,698
then you and I renegotiate, OK?
That sound good?

374
00:30:11,776 --> 00:30:13,767
OK.

375
00:30:19,584 --> 00:30:21,449
- Hey.
- Hi.

376
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:23,783
- How you doin'?
- Good.

377
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:28,857
- I can tell, you know.
- Tell what?

378
00:30:28,927 --> 00:30:31,725
That you've been dancing.
Your posture, it's a dead giveaway.

379
00:30:31,796 --> 00:30:33,957
- You're kidding.
- No.

380
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:38,595
- How much you been practicing, anyway?
- Just in class.

381
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:42,606
No. Should be five to one.
Five-to-one ratio.

382
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:46,542
Five hours of practice
for every one hour of class.

383
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:52,244
Doctor Dance has an open
dance party every Thursday.

384
00:30:52,317 --> 00:30:55,718
Anybody can go and practice.
Even you.

385
00:30:57,322 --> 00:30:59,517
Ballroom is all or nothing, John.

386
00:30:59,591 --> 00:31:02,321
I'm draggin' your ass out of class
and onto a real dance floor.

387
00:31:02,393 --> 00:31:05,328
We'll go straight there
after work.

388
00:31:05,396 --> 00:31:07,694
- Link?
- Yeah?

389
00:31:07,765 --> 00:31:10,199
Can you really tell?

390
00:31:10,268 --> 00:31:11,963
Yeah.

391
00:31:33,992 --> 00:31:36,187
Having fun?

392
00:31:36,261 --> 00:31:39,753
- What are you doing here?
- Spying.

393
00:32:06,958 --> 00:32:09,256
Excuse me, we were
dancing together.

394
00:32:09,327 --> 00:32:12,091
Dude, she does not wanna
dance with you. Now back off.

395
00:32:12,163 --> 00:32:14,063
Hey, you know, I...

396
00:32:18,836 --> 00:32:22,602
Link always insists on dancing
with the youngest girls.

397
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:27,976
I've never seen him with his perfect
partner. Not that those are easy to find.

398
00:32:28,046 --> 00:32:30,014
Have you ever found one?

399
00:32:30,081 --> 00:32:34,984
Once. He was my
dancing partner for 15 years.

400
00:32:35,053 --> 00:32:37,920
- We were husband and wife for 14.
- Wow.

401
00:32:37,989 --> 00:32:42,688
Yeah. He was my perfect partner.
Doesn't happen twice in a lifetime.

402
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:45,695
I'm lucky it even happened once.

403
00:32:45,763 --> 00:32:46,661
Ah!

404
00:32:46,731 --> 00:32:51,395
At last, a song I know.
Oh, I love this song.

405
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:54,297
♪ Da da-da da...

406
00:32:54,372 --> 00:32:58,968
♪ Shall we still be together
With our arms around each other

407
00:32:59,043 --> 00:33:03,275
♪ And shall you be
my new romance?

408
00:33:03,348 --> 00:33:07,944
♪ On the clear understanding
that this kind of thing can happen

409
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:12,251
♪ Shall we dance, shall we dance,
shall we dance?

410
00:33:13,091 --> 00:33:16,857
It's The King and I.</i> Yul Brynner
and Deborah Kerr. Do you remember that?

411
00:33:16,928 --> 00:33:20,193
They held hands like this...
Oh, come on, John, let's try it.

412
00:33:20,264 --> 00:33:22,926
- No. No, no, no, I can't. No way. I can't.
- Why not?

413
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:28,029
- Oh, John, come on. Come on.
- I don't... No, I don't want to...

414
00:33:34,912 --> 00:33:37,244
Let go, John.

415
00:33:44,055 --> 00:33:46,046
That's it, John.

416
00:33:50,128 --> 00:33:51,152
Whoa!

417
00:33:51,229 --> 00:33:53,925
- Sorry! I wasn't watching.
- Hi! How are you?

418
00:33:53,998 --> 00:33:57,957
- It doesn't matter. We're finished anyway.
- What do you mean?

419
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:00,061
No offense, but I can't be
your dance partner.

420
00:34:00,138 --> 00:34:01,901
- Why?
- You're too much of a freak.

421
00:34:01,973 --> 00:34:05,739
I mean, look at your palms. They're
bright orange from self-tanning lotion.

422
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:11,407
Don't you know you're supposed to wash
your hands after you use that stuff?

423
00:34:16,687 --> 00:34:18,780
Excuse me.

424
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:47,513
Miss Mitzi couldn't make it tonight,
so I'll be your teacher.

425
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:49,212
I'm Paulina.

426
00:34:49,287 --> 00:34:54,315
And you're...
Chic and Vern and...

427
00:34:56,527 --> 00:34:59,621
- Tom.
- John. It's John.

428
00:35:01,799 --> 00:35:04,165
What would you like
to work on tonight?

429
00:35:04,235 --> 00:35:09,935
Well, in my opinion - Chic - I think since
we're beginners, a good idea would be...

430
00:35:10,007 --> 00:35:11,804
Waltz.

431
00:35:11,876 --> 00:35:14,071
Maybe the waltz.

432
00:35:17,181 --> 00:35:19,649
OK. Um...

433
00:35:19,717 --> 00:35:24,086
I'll work with you one at a time
and you can be first.

434
00:35:25,089 --> 00:35:27,250
OK. All right.

435
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,134
- Oops.
- I'm sorry.

436
00:37:04,589 --> 00:37:07,422
So are you really
a reporter for The Times</i>.

437
00:37:07,491 --> 00:37:10,016
Or are you just pickin' up on her,
like everybody else?

438
00:37:10,094 --> 00:37:13,086
I'm a reporter.
Plus, she's not my type.

439
00:37:13,164 --> 00:37:16,827
I like a woman built for comfort,
not for speed.

440
00:37:18,135 --> 00:37:22,936
Really? Why don't you put the camera
down and take me out on the dance floor?

441
00:37:23,007 --> 00:37:27,137
Two reasons: I'm working
and this is not my type of dance.

442
00:37:27,211 --> 00:37:28,872
Well, how do you know
if you've never tried?

443
00:37:28,946 --> 00:37:32,211
Come on, put the camera down.
Come on, give me a shot.

444
00:37:32,283 --> 00:37:33,682
Oh, dear!

445
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:35,810
Sorry, sorry!

446
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:40,788
- I'm sorry.
- It's gonna stain.

447
00:37:40,858 --> 00:37:44,385
Don't... worry.
I'll take care of it.

448
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:08,043
- Would you like to use this?
- Excuse me?

449
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:10,747
Just to wipe your coat, or...

450
00:38:12,256 --> 00:38:16,420
Go ahead, just take it.
Please. Go ahead.

451
00:38:16,494 --> 00:38:20,225
- It's silly, but it's my favorite coat.
- I'm sorry.

452
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:22,289
It's vintage.

453
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:26,828
But this part's real suede,
so now it's ruined.

454
00:38:26,904 --> 00:38:29,464
You sure?
Maybe they can fix that.

455
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:32,976
No. I know about stains. It's...

456
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:36,105
You know, I never understood that.
I never understood -

457
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:40,480
live cows get dirty all the time,
they don't get stained.

458
00:38:40,551 --> 00:38:44,544
All that leather stands in the mud,
nothing happens. Go figure. What is that?

459
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:47,849
Exactly.

460
00:38:50,027 --> 00:38:53,656
Get a little sauce
on your coat and look.

461
00:38:53,731 --> 00:38:55,892
- Why is that?
- I don't know.

462
00:38:55,966 --> 00:38:59,902
We'll have to ask the
next cow that comes by.

463
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:15,646
A man with a handkerchief. Wow.
I didn't know they made those anymore.

464
00:39:21,459 --> 00:39:27,591
I haven't eaten yet. If you haven't eaten yet,
maybe we can go and... get a bite.

465
00:39:28,432 --> 00:39:30,923
Someplace close. You know,
I saw a Chinese over here.

466
00:39:31,001 --> 00:39:35,836
We could use chopsticks and drop an
endless variety of things on our clothes.

467
00:39:35,906 --> 00:39:39,273
I'm sorry, I prefer not to
socialize with students.

468
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:41,902
Oh. OK. All right.

469
00:39:42,413 --> 00:39:45,541
I shouldn't have taken this from you.
I'll buy you a new one.

470
00:39:45,616 --> 00:39:49,245
Please. I didn't...
I didn't mean anything by that.

471
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:52,088
I'll buy you a new one.

472
00:39:52,156 --> 00:39:54,147
Excuse me.

473
00:39:58,763 --> 00:40:01,459
Mr. Clark, I take dance
very seriously.

474
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:05,194
Miss Mitzi's is a school,
not a disco.

475
00:40:05,269 --> 00:40:07,737
And I hope you didn't join class
with me as your goal,

476
00:40:07,805 --> 00:40:10,865
because you'd be
wasting your time.

477
00:40:11,609 --> 00:40:14,874
Don't dance if that's
what you're after.

478
00:40:33,063 --> 00:40:36,055
Dance lessons? My husband
is taking dance lessons?

479
00:40:36,133 --> 00:40:38,567
Well, I've found a lot worse hiding
in the potpourri over the years.

480
00:40:38,636 --> 00:40:39,728
Consider yourself lucky.

481
00:40:39,804 --> 00:40:42,364
What's this beautiful
young woman? Who's she?

482
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,534
His substitute teacher.
His regular teacher's a much older woman.

483
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:47,941
Great legs, but older.

484
00:40:48,012 --> 00:40:52,676
Mr. Devine, what would make a man who's
done the same thing for the last 20 years...

485
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:56,379
suddenly do something so completely
out of character just out of the blue?

486
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:58,718
That's a question for a shrink.
I'm just a detective.

487
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:03,522
I'm not asking you as a detective.
I'm asking you as a man.

488
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:11,931
Scottie? What would cause
a man after 20 years...

489
00:41:12,002 --> 00:41:14,095
to do something completely
out of character out of the blue?

490
00:41:14,171 --> 00:41:16,639
- Did I get that right?
- Yeah.

491
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:23,037
"The mass of men
lead lives of quiet desperation."

492
00:41:23,113 --> 00:41:25,946
Maybe the desperation
can't be quiet anymore.

493
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:27,347
Bingo.

494
00:41:27,418 --> 00:41:29,784
That's a wonderful use
of Thoreau, Scottie.

495
00:41:29,854 --> 00:41:32,084
Thank you.
Hello again, Mrs. Clark.

496
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:33,885
Hey.

497
00:41:35,125 --> 00:41:37,753
- Desperation.
- Well, that's a possibility.

498
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:40,456
Mrs. Clark, the point is
your husband's dancing,

499
00:41:40,531 --> 00:41:42,192
he's not checking into
hotel rooms.

500
00:41:42,266 --> 00:41:44,427
We can continue to keep an eye
on things for you,

501
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:48,598
but my guess is your husband will hang up
his dancing shoes shortly anyway.

502
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:53,268
- What makes you say that?
- Voice of experience.

503
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:56,677
You give him some time.
He'll be home soon.

504
00:42:05,656 --> 00:42:10,593
"The rest is up to you", I tell my clients.
"The rest is up to you."

505
00:42:11,395 --> 00:42:13,192
Every few years they come back.

506
00:42:13,264 --> 00:42:18,395
So I have these snapshots in my head
of how they've changed over the years.

507
00:42:18,469 --> 00:42:24,999
The ones who've changed the most finally
bought that boat. Moved to that island.

508
00:42:25,075 --> 00:42:27,236
Those who haven't changed...

509
00:42:27,311 --> 00:42:31,941
I suppose they take comfort in
knowing what course their lives are on.

510
00:42:32,016 --> 00:42:35,850
They like to believe
they know what lies ahead.

511
00:42:38,822 --> 00:42:40,221
Shit!

512
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:06,477
Dad!

513
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:09,018
Evan!
What are you doing here?

514
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:12,522
Trying to meet up with some friends.
What are you doing here?

515
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:14,080
Well, you know, work...

516
00:43:14,158 --> 00:43:17,616
I had to come to visit a client
over here. I had to come by and...

517
00:43:17,695 --> 00:43:20,789
- It's really weird.
- It is?

518
00:43:20,864 --> 00:43:24,960
Yeah. Because I've been wanting you
to meet this girl that I'm crazy about,

519
00:43:25,035 --> 00:43:29,529
and I'm going to meet her right now
at this bar with my other friends.

520
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:32,599
So can you...
Do you wanna go?

521
00:43:33,577 --> 00:43:36,569
Of course I do.
Lead on, my son.

522
00:43:52,096 --> 00:43:54,587
Come on, let's get out there.

523
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:58,158
So, does your dad
wanna dance?

524
00:43:58,235 --> 00:44:01,568
I don't know. Dad, you haven't
danced in, what, 90 years?

525
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:05,166
You two go. Go.
It's been a long day for me.

526
00:44:30,901 --> 00:44:32,892
Mr. Clark?

527
00:44:33,404 --> 00:44:35,235
Mr. Clark?

528
00:44:35,439 --> 00:44:37,566
Do you wanna dance?

529
00:44:40,778 --> 00:44:43,178
Yes. Yes, I do.

530
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:44,469
OK.

531
00:44:44,548 --> 00:44:46,846
Could you say goodbye
to Evan for me? Thank you.

532
00:44:46,917 --> 00:44:48,885
Sure.

533
00:45:00,664 --> 00:45:04,225
- Sorry I'm late.
- Don't let it happen again.

534
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:09,204
Join the warm-up, John.

535
00:46:13,737 --> 00:46:15,568
Come on!

536
00:46:15,639 --> 00:46:17,504
Christ, Vern!

537
00:46:18,709 --> 00:46:22,110
You're soaking wet, man.
I already had a shower today.

538
00:46:22,179 --> 00:46:24,909
- Sorry.
- You're disgusting!

539
00:46:24,982 --> 00:46:26,916
You don't have
to put it like that.

540
00:46:26,984 --> 00:46:29,680
Why not? It's the truth.
And I prefer to tell the truth,

541
00:46:29,753 --> 00:46:33,689
unlike some people who make up stories
about nonexistent fiancées.

542
00:46:33,757 --> 00:46:36,157
What are you talking about?
He's getting married in the fall.

543
00:46:36,226 --> 00:46:38,285
Oh, come on.
What, are ya dumb?

544
00:46:38,362 --> 00:46:41,854
People who are engaged take the classes
together, or what the hell's the point?

545
00:46:41,932 --> 00:46:47,097
Come on, tell the people the truth.
You're not engaged, are you?

546
00:46:47,171 --> 00:46:48,331
Huh?

547
00:46:48,405 --> 00:46:50,430
- Not exactly.
- Uh-huh.

548
00:46:51,441 --> 00:46:55,537
- I haven't asked her quite yet.
- Thank you very much.

549
00:46:58,615 --> 00:47:01,709
Look, I was gonna lose
some weight first,

550
00:47:01,785 --> 00:47:06,688
and then I was gonna take
her dancing somewhere romantic.

551
00:47:06,757 --> 00:47:09,521
And then maybe pop the question.

552
00:47:10,928 --> 00:47:15,365
But I guess if I'm sweating all over the
place, that wouldn't be too romantic, huh?

553
00:47:16,066 --> 00:47:18,330
She's a great dancer.

554
00:47:21,271 --> 00:47:25,071
Well, hey, don't listen to me.
What, are you...

555
00:47:27,044 --> 00:47:32,209
C'mon, don't be a big baby. I didn't mean
to upset you or anything. Jesus, Vern.

556
00:47:34,051 --> 00:47:36,315
I said I was sorry.

557
00:47:38,055 --> 00:47:39,386
Bobbie!

558
00:47:40,824 --> 00:47:42,917
Somebody call a doctor.

559
00:47:42,993 --> 00:47:45,484
Are you all right? She's out.

560
00:47:47,331 --> 00:47:51,233
It's her electrolytes. They get crazy
because she overworks herself.

561
00:47:51,301 --> 00:47:54,134
She's been in here twice before.

562
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:56,695
And it's getting so boring, Mom.

563
00:47:56,773 --> 00:48:00,106
- Shut up, Tina.
- No, you shut up. God, she pisses me off.

564
00:48:00,177 --> 00:48:03,977
She pulls a 12-hour shift at
Jimmy's Diner, working five till five,

565
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:06,845
and then she goes and cooks and
cleans for an old feeb in a wheelchair...

566
00:48:06,917 --> 00:48:09,215
to earn extra money
for her crazy costumes.

567
00:48:09,286 --> 00:48:12,983
And then she plays Cinderella
every night at dance practice.

568
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:16,423
- When you should be home, resting.
- I don't need rest.

569
00:48:16,493 --> 00:48:19,929
Right. You need to hang out and flirt with
the shy guy with the nice-smelling sweat.

570
00:48:19,997 --> 00:48:22,557
- She told me all about you.
- Shut up, Tina.

571
00:48:22,633 --> 00:48:25,193
I never said his sweat smells nice.
I never said...

572
00:48:25,269 --> 00:48:27,829
She said it was the best-smelling sweat
she'd ever smelled.

573
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:29,031
OK, kill me now.

574
00:48:29,106 --> 00:48:33,372
It's all right, Bobbie. I've smelled
his sweat and I agree, it's not bad.

575
00:48:33,443 --> 00:48:36,435
Well, I mean, it's no field of flowers
after a spring rain...

576
00:48:36,513 --> 00:48:38,845
Yeah, I think we've talked
about this enough.

577
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:42,613
Maybe we should all go home now
and let Bobbie get some rest.

578
00:48:42,686 --> 00:48:44,244
- Yeah.
- Bye, sweetheart.

579
00:48:44,321 --> 00:48:47,313
Thank you. Thank you.

580
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:04,801
Bobbie needs a partner
for the competition.

581
00:49:04,875 --> 00:49:07,105
Why not you, John?

582
00:49:07,177 --> 00:49:12,979
Me? Competition? No, no, I can't...
She'd never go for it anyway. Forget it.

583
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:17,851
Why not? What are you talking about?
You heard her daughter - she likes you.

584
00:49:17,921 --> 00:49:21,413
And dance begins
with the dancers' feelings.

585
00:49:21,491 --> 00:49:25,325
I'll work with the both of you
after class. Two extra hours.

586
00:49:25,395 --> 00:49:29,491
The Miss Mitzi Special.
We've got three months.

587
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:32,928
This is good.

588
00:49:39,076 --> 00:49:41,135
What do you think?

589
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:46,377
I think you better
stock up on deodorant.

590
00:49:54,057 --> 00:49:58,289
Anything a client says
in a lawyer's office is confidential.

591
00:49:58,362 --> 00:50:01,729
So I've gotten used
to holding onto secrets.

592
00:50:01,798 --> 00:50:04,198
They're usually
nothing incriminating.

593
00:50:04,267 --> 00:50:08,727
But a lot of people have accounts
they haven't reconciled -

594
00:50:08,805 --> 00:50:12,070
things they're just
not ready to share.

595
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:23,816
I took the liberty of ordering for you.
Bombay Sapphire, three limes.

596
00:50:23,887 --> 00:50:27,050
I hired you to watch my husband.
You're not supposed to be watching me.

597
00:50:27,124 --> 00:50:29,991
It's very hard not to, Mrs. Clark -
with all due respect.

598
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:32,790
- Are you a married man, Mr. Devine?
- I was.

599
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:35,832
- Oh, what happened?
- Unfaithful.

600
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:38,600
- She hired a detective?
- No, no, no.

601
00:50:38,668 --> 00:50:42,570
When she found out,
I was too far gone, so...

602
00:50:42,639 --> 00:50:45,039
You're smiling at me.

603
00:50:45,108 --> 00:50:47,702
You are on a strange journey
to redemption, Mr. Devine.

604
00:50:47,778 --> 00:50:50,406
And a very long one, Mrs. Clark.

605
00:50:54,217 --> 00:50:56,344
All these promises
that we make and we break.

606
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:58,718
Why is it, do you think,
that people get married?

607
00:50:58,789 --> 00:51:01,485
- Passion.
- No.

608
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:06,495
That's interesting. Because I would've
taken you for a romantic. Why, then?

609
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:10,458
Because we need
a witness to our lives.

610
00:51:10,534 --> 00:51:15,267
There's a billion people on the planet.
I mean, what does any one life really mean?

611
00:51:15,338 --> 00:51:20,935
But in a marriage, you're promising
to care about everything -

612
00:51:21,011 --> 00:51:25,209
the good things, the bad things,
the terrible things, the mundane things...

613
00:51:25,282 --> 00:51:27,842
All of it.
All the time, every day.

614
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:34,050
You're saying, "Your life will not
go unnoticed, because I will notice it.

615
00:51:34,124 --> 00:51:38,925
"Your life will not go unwitnessed,
because I will be your witness."

616
00:51:42,632 --> 00:51:45,328
You can quote me on that,
if you like.

617
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:47,233
I'm sure I will.

618
00:51:47,304 --> 00:51:50,068
Anyway, the reason
that I called you here today,

619
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:53,473
to tell you in person that I won't
be needing your services anymore.

620
00:51:53,543 --> 00:51:54,737
Oh.

621
00:51:54,811 --> 00:51:56,278
I think to continue...

622
00:51:56,346 --> 00:52:01,181
would be an unwarranted invasion
of my husband's privacy and...

623
00:52:01,251 --> 00:52:03,879
Anyway, even though
there was a reason...

624
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:08,584
I'm sorry for what I've done
and I know enough now and...

625
00:52:09,426 --> 00:52:11,553
it's time to stop.

626
00:52:12,829 --> 00:52:16,128
Thank you for everything
and... goodbye.

627
00:52:16,199 --> 00:52:17,962
Bye.

628
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:22,962
Mrs. Clark?

629
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:27,009
I was right.
You are a romantic.

630
00:52:36,386 --> 00:52:38,081
Bobbie!

631
00:52:38,155 --> 00:52:40,214
- A new costume.
- Yeah.

632
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:42,690
I got it from this mermaid dream
I had in the hospital.

633
00:52:42,759 --> 00:52:44,659
Just floated up from
my subconscious.

634
00:52:44,728 --> 00:52:47,822
Where, tragically,
it did not stay.

635
00:52:49,366 --> 00:52:52,199
Come on, partner.
What are you waiting for?

636
00:52:52,269 --> 00:52:54,499
Divine intervention?

637
00:52:54,571 --> 00:52:59,804
You're a brave man, John Clark. Not
just anyone could take on the Bobbinator.

638
00:52:59,876 --> 00:53:00,934
Yeah.

639
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:03,070
Good luck, man.
We're with you.

640
00:53:03,146 --> 00:53:07,207
Somebody help me up! Please?

641
00:53:08,218 --> 00:53:10,186
John!

642
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:18,954
OK. 55 days from today you two
are gonna win the novice competition.

643
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:21,998
That means you're gonna
have to master five dances.

644
00:53:22,065 --> 00:53:25,034
I've asked Paulina
to videotape you tonight,

645
00:53:25,101 --> 00:53:27,501
so you can see what
you're doing wrong.

646
00:53:27,571 --> 00:53:30,199
Let's start with a rumba.

647
00:53:56,166 --> 00:53:58,566
What? What is it?

648
00:53:58,635 --> 00:54:02,264
It's the rumba.
It's the dance of love.

649
00:54:03,406 --> 00:54:05,897
And he's just not
giving me anything.

650
00:54:05,976 --> 00:54:08,911
What does she want me to do?
I'm doing it exactly the way I was taught.

651
00:54:08,979 --> 00:54:10,139
You think it's easy...?

652
00:54:10,213 --> 00:54:15,742
The rumba... is a vertical expression
of a horizontal wish.

653
00:54:15,819 --> 00:54:21,655
You have to hold her like the skin
on her thigh is your reason for living.

654
00:54:22,525 --> 00:54:27,121
Let her go like your heart's
being ripped from your chest.

655
00:54:28,031 --> 00:54:34,664
Pull her back like you're gonna have your
way with her, right here on the dance floor.

656
00:54:34,738 --> 00:54:37,138
And then finish...

657
00:54:38,441 --> 00:54:41,239
Like she's ruined you for life.

658
00:54:54,658 --> 00:54:57,422
See? Why can't you
just do it like that?

659
00:54:58,395 --> 00:55:01,694
Anyone else care
for a glass of water?

660
00:55:04,501 --> 00:55:05,559
Damn it!

661
00:55:05,635 --> 00:55:07,227
No, not you.

662
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:10,239
Look, I have to call you back.

663
00:55:10,307 --> 00:55:12,468
No, he's not home yet.

664
00:55:19,249 --> 00:55:22,082
What was the score at half-time
in the NBA playoffs last night?

665
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:23,016
Why?

666
00:55:23,086 --> 00:55:24,883
Why? You said you watched.
What was the score?

667
00:55:24,954 --> 00:55:27,980
- I forget now.
- You didn't forget. You didn't watch.

668
00:55:28,058 --> 00:55:30,925
You don't care about playoffs.
You care about dancing!

669
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:32,427
Shh!

670
00:55:32,495 --> 00:55:33,962
I do not.

671
00:55:34,030 --> 00:55:35,861
Yeah? Then what's this?

672
00:55:35,932 --> 00:55:39,299
Give me that! No!
Give me that! Give me...

673
00:55:39,369 --> 00:55:41,894
It's not even mine.
It's my mother's.

674
00:55:43,773 --> 00:55:46,833
At least, it was my mother's until I took it
to this wonderful alterations guy...

675
00:55:46,910 --> 00:55:49,344
who had it tailored for me.

676
00:55:50,647 --> 00:55:53,480
Look, it's not like I've
figured this out either.

677
00:55:53,550 --> 00:55:56,713
- Hey, listen...
- What?

678
00:55:56,786 --> 00:55:58,310
- Come back to class.
- No.

679
00:55:58,388 --> 00:56:01,880
You could take over as
Bobbie's partner in the Latin dances.

680
00:56:01,958 --> 00:56:05,325
You've got those knocked already.
There's no way I could learn 'em in time.

681
00:56:05,395 --> 00:56:07,920
I'm not comin' back as
the Bobbinator's partner!

682
00:56:07,997 --> 00:56:10,465
We'll look like an olive
and a toothpick together.

683
00:56:10,533 --> 00:56:12,763
Besides, she would
never dance with me.

684
00:56:12,836 --> 00:56:14,633
Sure she would.

685
00:56:14,704 --> 00:56:19,073
Just the Latin dances.
I'll still do the waltz and the quickstep.

686
00:56:19,142 --> 00:56:21,007
She would.

687
00:56:21,411 --> 00:56:22,969
No!

688
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:27,380
Not if he was the last bald, bad-breathed,
heterosexual sequin-freak on earth -

689
00:56:27,450 --> 00:56:29,782
which he probably is.
I'm not doin' it.

690
00:56:29,853 --> 00:56:33,186
You wanna win the Latin competition
or not? It's up to you. I don't care.

691
00:56:33,256 --> 00:56:37,249
Link already knows the dances.
And he'll be a good competitor.

692
00:56:37,327 --> 00:56:39,318
Right, Link?

693
00:56:46,669 --> 00:56:49,763
So, finally giving up
on the underage bimbettes...

694
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:51,966
and gonna go for a real woman?
Is that it?

695
00:56:52,041 --> 00:56:57,673
Yeah, no more underage bimbettes for me.
Only real women from now on.

696
00:56:57,747 --> 00:57:03,379
Don't even think about coming near me
without a breath mint. You got that?

697
00:57:03,453 --> 00:57:06,286
And quit lookin' at my ass.

698
00:57:06,356 --> 00:57:08,756
We'll try.

699
00:57:08,825 --> 00:57:13,455
Vern, you know, there's a
joyful freedom in your Latin.

700
00:57:13,530 --> 00:57:18,490
And Chic, you have an innate sensuality
quite uncommon in a man.

701
00:57:19,502 --> 00:57:23,336
I've entered you both in the
competition along with John.

702
00:57:25,175 --> 00:57:27,109
Good. That's settled.

703
00:57:48,631 --> 00:57:50,997
You... are the frame.

704
00:57:51,067 --> 00:57:52,534
I'm the frame.

705
00:57:52,602 --> 00:57:56,698
- She is the picture...
- She is the picture...

706
00:57:56,773 --> 00:57:58,832
...in your frame.

707
00:57:58,908 --> 00:58:02,366
Everything that you do
is to show her off.

708
00:58:03,012 --> 00:58:05,344
- You got that?
- I didn't hear that.

709
00:58:19,729 --> 00:58:22,163
Nice. Invite the lady in.

710
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:25,900
And... make the connection.

711
00:58:29,639 --> 00:58:32,335
Projecting to the third balcony.

712
00:58:34,844 --> 00:58:37,108
911! 911, quick!

713
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:39,546
Quick, 911! 9...

714
00:58:42,285 --> 00:58:46,278
And start here with an
initial sweep past the crowd.

715
00:58:46,356 --> 00:58:48,347
Watch.

716
00:58:52,929 --> 00:58:54,920
And contra-check.

717
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:06,333
Excellent.

718
00:59:51,654 --> 00:59:54,145
Oh, Jesus.

719
00:59:54,223 --> 00:59:55,815
We wanted something unusual.

720
00:59:55,892 --> 00:59:57,223
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

721
00:59:57,293 --> 00:59:58,624
- You sure?
- No, I'm good.

722
00:59:58,695 --> 01:00:01,892
But you guys look exhausted.

723
01:00:01,965 --> 01:00:05,526
I tell you what,
why don't we call it a night?

724
01:00:05,602 --> 01:00:09,129
For your sake, John.
You look like you're toast.

725
01:00:09,205 --> 01:00:12,402
- And tomorrow's a big day.
- Yeah.

726
01:00:12,475 --> 01:00:14,306
- Get home safe.
- OK.

727
01:00:14,978 --> 01:00:17,071
- I'm wearing you guys out.
- No. No, no, no.

728
01:00:17,146 --> 01:00:22,015
It's good. I like it when my feet hurt.
Takes my mind off my knees.

729
01:00:22,085 --> 01:00:26,146
I've just been getting carried away, you
know, working hard with the two of you.

730
01:00:26,222 --> 01:00:29,623
I guess I like it.
Feels good, you know?

731
01:00:29,692 --> 01:00:31,660
For me too.

732
01:00:32,795 --> 01:00:36,162
All right.
Well, I'm going home.

733
01:00:36,232 --> 01:00:38,427
Hey, wait.

734
01:00:41,404 --> 01:00:45,602
I wanted to talk to you about
that night that you asked me to dinner.

735
01:00:45,675 --> 01:00:49,008
I'm sorry about
how I treated you.

736
01:00:49,846 --> 01:00:53,043
It's just, you know, that people get
the wrong idea about me all the time.

737
01:00:53,116 --> 01:00:56,142
Paulina, you don't have to
explain anything to me, ever.

738
01:00:56,219 --> 01:00:59,416
Well, I know I don't have
to explain anything to anybody...

739
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:01,389
because I don't care
what people think about me.

740
01:01:01,457 --> 01:01:03,925
Good. Good.

741
01:01:03,993 --> 01:01:07,861
- I mean it.
- Yeah, uh-huh. Good. Good.

742
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:20,338
I'm sorry. I shouldn't
be here right now.

743
01:01:20,410 --> 01:01:26,076
No, it's OK. I think I'm just
hungry or something.

744
01:01:29,986 --> 01:01:32,181
- Hungry?
- Very.

745
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:37,285
- Oh, this is so stupid.
- No.

746
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:40,591
No, not at all. No, no.
I cry too when I'm hungry.

747
01:01:40,663 --> 01:01:43,325
For French fries, usually. You?

748
01:01:44,667 --> 01:01:46,225
Cake.

749
01:01:50,807 --> 01:01:53,367
Careful. Don't spill it
on your new coat.

750
01:01:53,443 --> 01:01:56,640
- Old coat, new color. I had it dyed.
- Yeah?

751
01:01:56,713 --> 01:01:59,614
Yeah, my dad did it.
He's a dry-cleaner.

752
01:01:59,682 --> 01:02:03,812
As is my mom, my brother,
my two older sisters and me.

753
01:02:03,886 --> 01:02:06,252
I told you I know about stains.

754
01:02:06,322 --> 01:02:11,191
- You're a dry-cleaner?
- Well, I was. Until I was eight.

755
01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:13,990
Actually, that's when
I started dancing.

756
01:02:14,063 --> 01:02:16,725
I was helping out in the store
one day after school...

757
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:19,791
when my mom asked me
to go in the back and get an order.

758
01:02:19,869 --> 01:02:25,967
It was this incredibly delicate sequined
thing, held together by a gold thread.

759
01:02:26,042 --> 01:02:30,069
Well, I carried the costume
like it was gonna break.

760
01:02:30,146 --> 01:02:32,580
And then I saw the customer.

761
01:02:32,648 --> 01:02:37,244
She was the most beautiful woman
I had ever laid eyes on.

762
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:43,054
She invited us to see her dance that night.
And my mother said yes.

763
01:02:45,428 --> 01:02:51,230
It was like the whole world had suddenly
gone from black-and-white to color.

764
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:54,963
The beautiful woman and her partner
stopped right in front of us...

765
01:02:55,037 --> 01:02:57,631
and did a waltz pose.

766
01:02:57,707 --> 01:03:01,837
She tilted her head back
and she winked at me.

767
01:03:02,945 --> 01:03:06,813
And I felt like she was trying
to tell me something.

768
01:03:06,883 --> 01:03:09,249
I took it as a sign.

769
01:03:09,318 --> 01:03:14,756
And from then on. I knew that
ballroom dancing would be my life.

770
01:03:20,263 --> 01:03:23,824
It wasn't the kind of dream
my parents had in mind.

771
01:03:25,401 --> 01:03:27,869
What made you wanna dance?

772
01:03:28,504 --> 01:03:30,495
You.

773
01:03:32,108 --> 01:03:35,566
Looking out that window,
right up there.

774
01:03:36,813 --> 01:03:39,680
You can see it from the train and...

775
01:03:40,583 --> 01:03:46,647
every night I'd come home from work
and I'd look for you, your face.

776
01:03:48,391 --> 01:03:52,828
You looked on the outside
the way I was feeling on the inside.

777
01:03:52,895 --> 01:03:54,988
I was watching you too.

778
01:03:55,064 --> 01:03:57,328
From the window I saw you
practicing on the platform.

779
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:59,391
No! Oh...

780
01:04:03,739 --> 01:04:09,871
That night I said all those things to you,
I didn't think I'd ever see you again.

781
01:04:12,181 --> 01:04:14,706
But you kept coming back.

782
01:04:14,784 --> 01:04:16,843
I didn't want to.

783
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:22,789
But I figured if I hadn't, you'd have been
right about everything you accused me of.

784
01:04:22,859 --> 01:04:26,420
Then I started dancing and I found
I really liked it. It made me happy.

785
01:04:26,495 --> 01:04:28,622
Yes, it shows.

786
01:04:28,698 --> 01:04:34,261
I mean, I feel excited about something
for the first time in such a long time.

787
01:04:34,337 --> 01:04:35,929
- Aren't you?
- Excited?

788
01:04:36,005 --> 01:04:39,065
About tomorrow.
The competition.

789
01:04:39,141 --> 01:04:42,133
No, no, no.
I'm petrified. I'm...

790
01:04:42,945 --> 01:04:45,880
I'm gonna forget everything, I won't be able
to put one foot in front of the other,

791
01:04:45,948 --> 01:04:49,247
- I'll make a mess of the whole thing.
- No.

792
01:04:54,290 --> 01:04:56,758
Give me one hour.

793
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:07,560
Leave it. Leave the light.

794
01:05:13,476 --> 01:05:16,934
Don't say anything...
and don't think.

795
01:05:19,649 --> 01:05:22,846
And don't move
unless you feel it.

796
01:07:50,833 --> 01:07:53,131
Be this alive.

797
01:07:56,539 --> 01:07:59,269
Be this alive tomorrow.

798
01:08:13,489 --> 01:08:15,514
Thank you.

799
01:09:17,086 --> 01:09:19,452
God, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I lost my balance.

800
01:09:19,522 --> 01:09:21,251
Oh, that's OK.
I lost my fiancé.

801
01:09:21,323 --> 01:09:22,620
Lisa! Lisa.

802
01:09:22,691 --> 01:09:25,592
- There you are.
- Found the earring.

803
01:09:30,332 --> 01:09:33,233
John Clark.
Photo op. Come on.

804
01:09:33,736 --> 01:09:35,260
Smile, everyone.

805
01:09:35,337 --> 01:09:38,033
Paso doble!

806
01:09:39,542 --> 01:09:42,443
- Good luck, everybody.
- Good luck.

807
01:09:43,045 --> 01:09:44,376
- Hey.
- Yeah.

808
01:09:44,446 --> 01:09:48,348
So what did I tell you?
Girls love guys who can dance, right?

809
01:09:48,417 --> 01:09:51,386
Even I got a partner.
Check it out.

810
01:09:51,453 --> 01:09:53,421
Cute.

811
01:09:53,489 --> 01:09:57,550
- But who's the guy?
- Oh, that's her brother.

812
01:09:59,261 --> 01:10:02,128
Yeah, we play basketball together.

813
01:10:08,637 --> 01:10:12,129
Aren't they adorable?
They're gonna get slaughtered.

814
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:14,369
Oh, shh. Don't say that.

815
01:10:16,345 --> 01:10:18,336
Mr. Clark.

816
01:10:19,315 --> 01:10:21,078
John?

817
01:10:22,051 --> 01:10:25,543
You look blue. Breathe.

818
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:32,584
Thanks.

819
01:10:35,564 --> 01:10:38,590
Ladies and gentlemen,
good evening.

820
01:10:38,667 --> 01:10:42,569
The Chicago Taittinger Trophy
Latin competition will now begin.

821
01:10:42,638 --> 01:10:47,268
Judges, this is a semifinal round
with 11 couples on the floor.

822
01:10:47,343 --> 01:10:51,302
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
your first dance is the cha-cha.

823
01:10:51,380 --> 01:10:53,109
Music, please.

824
01:11:16,705 --> 01:11:19,139
Nice chassé, Vern!

825
01:11:49,238 --> 01:11:51,035
Whoa!

826
01:12:14,563 --> 01:12:16,929
Let's hear it for the cha-cha,
ladies and gentlemen.

827
01:12:16,999 --> 01:12:21,095
Who's your favorite couple out there?
Let them hear their numbers.

828
01:12:21,170 --> 01:12:25,129
We danced like shit! All you did
was worry about that stupid wig!

829
01:12:25,207 --> 01:12:27,232
Well, what did you
expect me to do? You saw...

830
01:12:27,309 --> 01:12:29,539
I know, he's a pig.
But you know what? This is Latin.

831
01:12:29,611 --> 01:12:31,909
The judges are looking
at your hips, not your hair.

832
01:12:31,980 --> 01:12:35,939
So unless that thing
looks good on your ass, lose it!

833
01:12:36,552 --> 01:12:38,543
Fine!

834
01:12:44,259 --> 01:12:46,921
We love you, baldy!

835
01:12:47,629 --> 01:12:49,062
Thank you, dancers.

836
01:12:49,131 --> 01:12:52,828
Please take your positions for your
second and final dance of this competition,

837
01:12:52,901 --> 01:12:55,426
the paso doble.

838
01:12:55,504 --> 01:12:57,096
Music, please.

839
01:13:22,998 --> 01:13:25,592
Looks like he got rid of
a lot more than the wig.

840
01:14:33,836 --> 01:14:37,738
Ladies and gentlemen, I have the
final results for the Latin competition.

841
01:14:37,806 --> 01:14:41,708
Your finalists are...
couple 102...

842
01:14:42,945 --> 01:14:45,971
We did it! Lisa,
we did it, we did it!

843
01:14:46,048 --> 01:14:47,811
Couple 104.

844
01:14:51,019 --> 01:14:54,352
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- Couple 106.

845
01:14:54,723 --> 01:14:56,691
Couple 109.

846
01:14:56,758 --> 01:14:59,226
Couple 110.

847
01:14:59,294 --> 01:15:01,319
And couple 105...

848
01:15:01,396 --> 01:15:04,092
has been disqualified.

849
01:15:04,166 --> 01:15:05,565
What?!

850
01:15:11,173 --> 01:15:13,471
I thought Slick Willy
was pretty good.

851
01:15:13,542 --> 01:15:17,911
Bad attitude. Ungentlemanly behavior.
It's a British sport, after all.

852
01:15:17,980 --> 01:15:20,175
- The man was working it.
- Well...

853
01:15:20,249 --> 01:15:22,342
Immediately following,
the standard competition.

854
01:15:22,417 --> 01:15:23,611
Ladies and gentlemen,

855
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:27,652
the Chicago Taittinger Trophy
standard competition will now begin.

856
01:15:28,156 --> 01:15:31,922
Judges, this is a semifinal round
with ten couples on the floor.

857
01:15:31,994 --> 01:15:34,986
They'll be dancing the waltz
and the quickstep.

858
01:15:35,063 --> 01:15:37,463
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
let's bring our dancers out...

859
01:15:37,533 --> 01:15:39,398
with a nice big round of applause.

860
01:15:39,468 --> 01:15:42,232
Couples 115...

861
01:15:42,738 --> 01:15:44,603
Couple 116.

862
01:15:48,844 --> 01:15:50,869
Couple number 117.

863
01:15:53,148 --> 01:15:55,582
Couple number 118.

864
01:15:56,952 --> 01:15:58,681
Couple number 119.

865
01:16:00,055 --> 01:16:02,182
Couple 120.

866
01:16:02,758 --> 01:16:04,817
Couple 121...

867
01:16:08,096 --> 01:16:09,620
Wow.

868
01:16:11,166 --> 01:16:13,600
Come on, come on,
we're gonna be late.

869
01:16:14,970 --> 01:16:16,961
Hey, you're not gonna
choke on me, are you?

870
01:16:17,039 --> 01:16:18,973
I think my feet are asleep,
I don't remember anything...

871
01:16:19,041 --> 01:16:21,305
Don't worry. You're great.
You look beautiful.

872
01:16:21,376 --> 01:16:23,970
And finally, couple number 126.

873
01:16:37,392 --> 01:16:40,953
- There they are.
- Yeah. They look nervous.

874
01:16:41,029 --> 01:16:43,224
No, not them. Them.

875
01:16:48,170 --> 01:16:49,865
You invited them?

876
01:16:49,938 --> 01:16:51,872
She said she wanted to be
a witness to her husband's life.

877
01:16:51,940 --> 01:16:53,965
I thought she should witness this.

878
01:16:54,042 --> 01:17:00,242
So you're a marriage counselor now. But
could you at least bill Mrs. Clark for that?

879
01:17:01,149 --> 01:17:03,947
As our dancers take their positions
for their first dance,

880
01:17:04,019 --> 01:17:10,390
I'd like to remind the judges that you'll be
recalling six couples for the final round.

881
01:17:10,459 --> 01:17:14,793
Ladies and gentlemen,
your first dance is the waltz.

882
01:17:16,965 --> 01:17:19,297
Music, please.

883
01:17:45,527 --> 01:17:47,791
Well done!

884
01:17:56,204 --> 01:17:58,195
He's awesome.

885
01:17:58,907 --> 01:18:01,205
Dad is awesome!

886
01:18:32,741 --> 01:18:34,732
Spectacular.

887
01:18:36,078 --> 01:18:37,909
It's spectacular.

888
01:19:08,610 --> 01:19:12,205
- 116!
- Whoo!

889
01:19:20,322 --> 01:19:22,586
Way to go, Dad!

890
01:19:27,662 --> 01:19:29,823
Such a beautiful waltz.

891
01:19:29,898 --> 01:19:31,798
We weren't terrible.
I can't believe it.

892
01:19:31,867 --> 01:19:34,700
Of course we weren't - you were
dancing with me, you big nut.

893
01:19:34,770 --> 01:19:38,604
...the second and final dance
of this competition, the quickstep!

894
01:19:47,249 --> 01:19:50,480
- Hey, is your daughter here tonight?
- No. Why?

895
01:19:50,552 --> 01:19:53,419
I thought I heard someone
yell at you "Go, Dad."

896
01:20:17,979 --> 01:20:19,708
Yes!

897
01:20:35,831 --> 01:20:37,321
126!

898
01:20:37,699 --> 01:20:39,690
Go, Dad!

899
01:20:48,410 --> 01:20:50,241
Way to go, Dad!

900
01:21:55,377 --> 01:21:57,242
- Beverly!
- Dad.

901
01:21:57,312 --> 01:21:59,803
- Wait a minute. Wait, wait.
- Dad, you were terrific.

902
01:21:59,881 --> 01:22:02,611
Get in the car, Jen.
Just get in the car.

903
01:22:02,684 --> 01:22:05,209
Beverly, how did you know?

904
01:22:05,287 --> 01:22:08,723
Because I hired a detective. Yeah.
I thought you were having an affair.

905
01:22:08,790 --> 01:22:12,248
- It's ridiculous, I know. OK. I feel...
- Hey, listen, that was really bad luck.

906
01:22:12,327 --> 01:22:14,386
Don't worry.
There's always next year.

907
01:22:14,462 --> 01:22:18,694
Oh, "there's always next year." Thanks.
Well, I have a whole year to prepare for it.

908
01:22:18,767 --> 01:22:21,702
- Beverly, please, can we talk...
- No, there's nothing to talk about.

909
01:22:21,770 --> 01:22:25,001
Please.
Will you please stay here...

910
01:22:28,310 --> 01:22:30,870
Stop. No.

911
01:22:30,946 --> 01:22:33,107
- Please, will you talk to me?
- If you want to talk,

912
01:22:33,181 --> 01:22:36,810
you can start by explaining what was it
that I just saw in there? What did I witness?

913
01:22:36,885 --> 01:22:38,819
I'm not having an affair.
There was no aff...

914
01:22:38,887 --> 01:22:41,378
What's goin' on?

915
01:22:41,456 --> 01:22:43,481
- Let's go!
- They're new friends.

916
01:22:43,558 --> 01:22:47,392
But you could've told me about it, couldn't
you? You just completely left me out.

917
01:22:47,462 --> 01:22:50,625
Why didn't you tell me, John?
You've gotta answer that.

918
01:22:50,699 --> 01:22:53,133
- I was ashamed.
- Ashamed of what? Of dancing?

919
01:22:53,201 --> 01:22:55,931
- Well, no, no...
- Well, then of what?

920
01:22:56,705 --> 01:22:59,003
Of wanting to be happier.

921
01:23:00,008 --> 01:23:02,442
When we have so much.

922
01:23:05,814 --> 01:23:08,339
And it's not your fault.

923
01:23:08,416 --> 01:23:12,785
Hey, Fred Astaire!
You're blocking traffic!

924
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:21,190
Finally! Thank you!

925
01:23:36,945 --> 01:23:42,008
The reading of a will can actually
come as a kind of relief.

926
01:23:43,518 --> 01:23:48,455
After the initial shock wears off
about that trust fund for the family dog,

927
01:23:48,523 --> 01:23:51,856
or the opera seats
left to the gardener,

928
01:23:51,926 --> 01:23:57,592
there is at least the sense that
everything is finally out on the table.

929
01:23:58,700 --> 01:24:02,295
This, you are not gonna
believe this, guys. Louis, Louis.

930
01:24:02,370 --> 01:24:05,032
"Link started dancing in 1985.

931
01:24:05,106 --> 01:24:09,202
"It soon became his passion and he
started dancing six days a week.

932
01:24:09,277 --> 01:24:11,268
"Lawyer by day and dancer by night,

933
01:24:11,346 --> 01:24:14,281
"Link really lights up the floor
with all of his energy."

934
01:24:14,349 --> 01:24:18,547
See? I told you. I knew it.
I knew Link Peterson was a freaky bastard.

935
01:24:18,620 --> 01:24:22,613
I think Linky Link might be batting for
the other team, you know what I mean?

936
01:24:23,458 --> 01:24:27,326
Could those pants be any tighter?
Look at his package!

937
01:24:27,395 --> 01:24:29,295
Somebody get a magnifying glass!

938
01:24:29,364 --> 01:24:34,358
There is nothing wrong
with ballroom dancing.

939
01:24:42,710 --> 01:24:44,701
Sorry.

940
01:24:46,881 --> 01:24:48,405
Oh...

941
01:24:57,859 --> 01:25:00,054
Fuck you all.

942
01:25:00,829 --> 01:25:03,161
And football sucks.

943
01:25:14,476 --> 01:25:16,034
- Hey, how you doin'?
- Hey.

944
01:25:16,111 --> 01:25:17,635
Surprise.

945
01:25:17,712 --> 01:25:19,976
- This is gorgeous.
- Yeah, it's a pretty spot.

946
01:25:20,048 --> 01:25:21,811
Thanks.

947
01:25:21,883 --> 01:25:23,646
John, look, we just wanted
to talk to you for a minute.

948
01:25:23,718 --> 01:25:27,245
Yeah, I just hope that you weren't
staying away from class on account of me.

949
01:25:27,322 --> 01:25:30,189
I'm not mad about you ripping
my dress or anything. Seriously.

950
01:25:30,258 --> 01:25:31,885
I mean, I know you always
wanted to look at my ass...

951
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:35,691
and I think you picked a pretty weird
time to do it, but I forgive you, John.

952
01:25:35,763 --> 01:25:37,958
- Thanks. Thank you.
- Honestly. OK?

953
01:25:38,032 --> 01:25:40,023
Come on, can we tell Miss Mitzi
you're coming back?

954
01:25:40,101 --> 01:25:46,040
I'm sorry, guys, I'm not coming back.
It's... It's... I'm done with that now.

955
01:25:46,107 --> 01:25:50,407
But thanks a lot for coming out here.
I really appreciate that.

956
01:25:50,478 --> 01:25:52,503
John, look...

957
01:25:52,580 --> 01:25:56,846
Paulina, you know, she's gonna
go to England to study dance,

958
01:25:56,918 --> 01:26:00,615
and we're havin' a little, you know,
going-away party for her...

959
01:26:00,688 --> 01:26:05,887
and we'd love for you to come.
Really love it if you would come by.

960
01:26:05,960 --> 01:26:09,020
She gave me this
to give to you, so...

961
01:26:13,835 --> 01:26:17,999
Anyway, we hope that
we see you there. All right?

962
01:26:18,072 --> 01:26:19,733
All right, come on.

963
01:26:19,807 --> 01:26:22,037
- Bye, John.
- Bye.

964
01:26:29,083 --> 01:26:32,951
"I hope you're not upset about
what happened with you and Bobbie.

965
01:26:33,021 --> 01:26:36,081
"Because you were
wonderful that night.

966
01:26:36,157 --> 01:26:41,390
"I'd hate to think that what happened
would make you give it all up.

967
01:26:41,462 --> 01:26:44,920
"You looked so graceful
and brave out there -

968
01:26:44,999 --> 01:26:50,665
a different person from the one who
first walked into Miss Mitzi's studio.

969
01:26:50,738 --> 01:26:55,766
"But a lot has changed for both of us
over the last few months.

970
01:26:57,645 --> 01:27:00,739
"When my partner and I
went to Blackpool last year...

971
01:27:00,815 --> 01:27:04,273
we were so excited
to make it to the finals.

972
01:27:06,487 --> 01:27:09,422
"Everyone was convinced
that we were going to win.

973
01:27:09,490 --> 01:27:12,050
And we wanted
to prove them right.

974
01:27:12,126 --> 01:27:15,892
"We'd been together as a couple
for as long as we'd been partners.

975
01:27:15,964 --> 01:27:22,460
"But we began training too hard.
Pushing each other. Expecting too much.

976
01:27:23,871 --> 01:27:28,069
"Well, we didn't win.
Not even close.

977
01:27:30,845 --> 01:27:35,111
"I came back without
my trophy or my partner.

978
01:27:35,817 --> 01:27:39,275
"And all this time I've been
hiding out at Miss Mitzi's.

979
01:27:39,354 --> 01:27:43,723
Angry at myself.
Frustrated and embarrassed.

980
01:27:45,960 --> 01:27:51,364
"But coaching you and Bobbie,
seeing how alive you were out there...

981
01:27:51,432 --> 01:27:54,560
made me realize
just how much I'd given up.

982
01:28:20,261 --> 01:28:24,891
"And now,
for the first time in a long time...

983
01:28:26,334 --> 01:28:28,928
I want to dance again.

984
01:28:31,205 --> 01:28:36,939
"So I need to thank you -
thank you for helping me to see this.

985
01:28:41,516 --> 01:28:46,818
"I hope I get to see you and dance
with you once more before I leave.

986
01:28:49,724 --> 01:28:51,715
"Paulina."

987
01:29:03,071 --> 01:29:05,062
Thanks.

988
01:29:08,042 --> 01:29:10,772
By the way, I'm not
going to this party.

989
01:29:10,845 --> 01:29:12,506
Oh, OK.

990
01:29:12,580 --> 01:29:15,947
But you're not
giving up dancing, are you?

991
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:22,978
You could...
teach me to dance.

992
01:29:25,927 --> 01:29:28,691
Beverly, I'm not
dancing anymore.

993
01:29:29,530 --> 01:29:31,395
Why not, Dad?

994
01:29:33,201 --> 01:29:36,602
Why don't you teach
Mom how to dance?

995
01:29:55,757 --> 01:30:00,717
The one thing I am proudest
of in my whole life...

996
01:30:02,797 --> 01:30:05,766
is that you are happy with me.

997
01:30:05,833 --> 01:30:10,896
If I couldn't... if I couldn't tell you
that I was unhappy sometimes,

998
01:30:10,972 --> 01:30:16,808
it was because I didn't want to risk
hurting the one person I treasure most.

999
01:30:19,814 --> 01:30:21,941
I'm so sorry.
