00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:15,470
Hey,hey,hey,hey Oohh,ooh

3
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,600
Won't you come see about me?

4
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:21,660
I'll be alone dancing

5
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:23,380
You know it,baby

6
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:27,340
Tell me your troubles and doubts

7
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:31,400
Giving me everything inside and out

8
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:36,650
And don't you forget about me

9
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,810
Don't,don't,don't,don't

10
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:45,540
Don't you forget about me

Victorious S03E01 The Breakfast Bunch

12
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,100
well,this is a great way to spend a Saturday.

13
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:54,020
I have never had detention before.

14
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm kind of nervous.

15
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:56,900
if you hadn't made us late for class,

16
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:57,740
We wouldn't be here.

17
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:00,780
I was choking on a pretzel!

18
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,390
well, why do you always gotta be chokin' on something'?

19
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:04,650
ah,give him a break.

20
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:05,650
yeah, it's not robbie's fault

21
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:08,090
He has a petite throat.

22
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:11,960
it's average!

23
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,400
hey,who's in charge of detention anyway?

24
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,430
vice principal--

25
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:18,070
Dickers.

26
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:22,200
mornin' waz-bags.

27
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:24,340
Detention is that way --

28
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:26,570
In the library.

29
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:30,980
Get ready for the worst day of your lives.

30
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:32,480
yay!

31
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,450
We're at school on a Saturday!

32
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:37,050
Ha ha ha ha...

33
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:38,690
library!

34
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:39,350
okay.

35
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,000
geez.

36
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:40,670
calm down.

37
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:45,930
well,well.

38
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:49,300
It's 7:06 a.M. here in los angeles.

39
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:54,000
That means in australia, it's yesterday.

40
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,540
Or tomorrow.

41
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:58,150
You know, in Australia.

42
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:00,600
When you flash the toilet, the water swirls backwdsds.

43
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:06,310
Put a socket in, alfro. You clowns are gonna sit here

44
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,830
all day and think about why you're in detention.

45
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:19,260
- Now, cellphones, let's have them.  - Why?

46
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:22,400
Because in detentions, there are no phone calls.

47
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,200
- What about texting?  - No!

48
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,270
- Email?  - No!

49
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:31,310
- Can we play grumpy gerbils?  - I love grumpy gerbils.

50
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:34,510
I can't get pass level twenty-three.

51
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:38,580
- Sip it, corn pie! - Can we have corn pie?

52
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:42,750
Shut up! Phones!

53
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,200
Now, I'm gonna put your box of phones right here.

54
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:58,390
What, princess?

55
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,540
I am just wondering what the plan is for lunch.

56
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:04,770
Well, if you pretends to get hungry,

57
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:08,940
There's a big plane of tuna right here.

58
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:12,380
Uh,techinically sir. If perishable foods aren't kept

59
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:15,990
either below 34 degrees or above 140 degrees--

60
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:17,670
Pipe outside, salad.

61
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,510
Eat the tuna or starve. I can care less.

62
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,840
um,I think you mean you couldn't care less.

63
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,740
what's that?

64
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:30,290
You said you could care less

65
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:32,870
which implies that you do care.

66
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:33,940
At least a little bit.

67
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:34,940
I don't.

68
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:38,750
well,then you should've said you couldn't care less.

69
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,050
but you did not.

70
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:44,270
Hey, what about the guy who first landed on the moon?

71
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:46,870
He said "One small step for man."

72
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:49,460
I wanna just say "Oh my god, I'm on the moon!"

73
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,960
All right, not another word.

74
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:54,020
Word.

75
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,270
That's it, West.

76
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:58,500
You just bought yourself for another Saturday detention.

77
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,960
did I get a good deal on it?

78
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:01,980
You just bought yourself another one!!!

79
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:05,610
Look, I am sorry. I apologize.

80
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:08,410
That's three. Three saturdays.

81
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:10,420
But she was apologizing.

82
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,250
okay, vega, now you got one.

83
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:12,920
Why?

84
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,200
boom! Another one!

85
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,480
I don't want another one.

86
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:17,660
that's three! You wanna try for four?

87
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:18,570
I really don't.

88
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:20,520
That's four. You want five?

89
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,260
yes.

90
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,670
Ok, Vega. You just got five!

91
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,180
- What?  - Tori.

92
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,120
Stop what? Jade said yes!

93
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:31,430
I guess he's afraid to get warm the rabbit.

94
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:33,750
oh yeah?

95
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:36,670
I got one for you too! Fudge sack!

96
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,490
Anybody else? Huh?

97
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:46,460
Anybody? You mess with the cow...

98
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:47,660
You get the udders.

99
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:01,440
forget you.

100
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:55,630
- You know what I could go for right now? - Tacos

101
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:59,870
- How you know? - I felt ya, dawg.

102
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:02,600
Tacos do sound really good right now.

103
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:07,780
- Put up for tacos.  - yeah, I love tacos.

104
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:10,540
Look who's been reeeaaal quiet.

105
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,420
I am just not that hungry right now.

106
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:16,780
Yeah, why do you tell everyone the truth?

107
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:19,550
- Leave me alone.  - What's goin' on here?

108
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:28,800
Our pristine little friend cat has never had a taco.

109
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:33,050
I'm not that pristine. Wait what's pristine mean?

110
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:38,330
are you a vegan?

111
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:43,780
Knock it off, guys.

112
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:45,080
What's a vegan?

113
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,100
It's a person who doesn't eat meat.

114
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:48,200
I love meat.

115
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:50,010
don't shush me.

116
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:55,260
Come on, Cat. Tell us.

117
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:58,590
Have you ever had a crispy corn shell...

118
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:02,830
full of meat, lettuce...

119
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,610
Shredded cheese...

120
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:14,210
Hey, leave her alone.

121
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,450
What do you gonna do if I don't?

122
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:21,350
Oh I just might go online... To the slap...

123
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:24,790
- And unfriend you.  -Oh really?

124
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:30,120
Two clicks. One to unfriend you.

125
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:34,890
And one to confirm that I am really wanna unfriend you.

126
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,900
Hey, come on y'all. How are we gonna get some tacos?

127
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,440
I can call Trina. Ask her to pick some up

128
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,530
and leave it in my locker.

129
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:47,620
You're so conceited, Tori.

130
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:50,100
You're so conceited

131
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,600
... What?

132
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,140
come on!

133
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:55,420
Okay.

134
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:16,190
Tacos. The girl has tacos. They're tacos.

135
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,470
Do you approve of this?

136
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:01,840
whoa,whoa,whoa,

137
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:04,320
The floor is wet.

138
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,760
You can't run across that. It's too dangerous.

139
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:14,450
Way to go, Tori. You just had to have your taco.

140
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:20,140
- We're dead.  - No... Just me.

141
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:27,340
- You guys get back to the library. - What about you?

142
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:30,500
- I am gonna get Dickers' attention. - How?

143
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:34,720
Here I am once again

144
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:39,910
You don't have to be afraid to put your dream in action.

145
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:43,800
You're never gonna fade you'll be the main attraction

146
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:47,670
Just remember me

147
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:50,000
Well, I'll make it shine.

148
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:55,540
oh, I'm gonna make it shine.

149
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,550
I'm gonna make it shine real good.

150
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:02,100
- Listen. - ahhhh,

151
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,100
You're in big trouble, Vega.

152
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,990
for what?

153
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:07,230
For leaving the library. Skinny-jeans.

154
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:12,060
And sing it off key. Come on!

155
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:16,600
I was running and singing at the same time! That's really hard.

156
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,100
oh, shut up!

157
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:30,060
That's the last time, Vega.

158
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,020
That's the last time you run around these halls

159
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:34,380
singing about making things shine.

160
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:37,800
I'm sorry.

161
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,200
You watch that mouth.

162
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:41,260
what did I say?!

163
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:45,900
You know what you're gonna be five years from now?

164
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:48,610
You're gonna be a big pop star.

165
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:51,960
that... Sounds pretty cool.

166
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:55,990
Ok, Miss pop star. See if you can pop this!

167
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:59,380

00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:00,620

179
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:56,490

184
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:16,500
Cat, you're not eating your taco.

185

187
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:28,980
vegan.

188
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,370
I am not.

189
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:32,700
then eat your taco if you're not a vegan.

190
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,460
why do you have to be so mean sometimes.

191
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:35,970
I know,right?

192
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:39,720
I am just honest. Unlike some people here.

193
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:43,900
What?

194
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,130
why aren't you eating your taco, Robbie.

195
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:50,370
you know, I am just getting ready.

196
00:13:53,610 --> 00:14:00,210
maybe we have another vegan among us.

197
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:02,780
I'm not a vegan. I had taco lots of times.

198
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:06,330

199
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:12,440

201
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:16,080

202
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:20,930
Robbie's trying to tell me that sometimes,

203
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:24,840
You and he crounch the corn shell together.

204
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:28,430
I didn't say that.

205
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,820
did you or did you not motion to Tori.

206
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,990

207
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:36,120

208
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:41,870

209
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:58,020
Oh, man. These tacos. It's got me pumped!

210
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:05,610
I think he's gonna run dance.

211
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:20,130
give her some hot sauce.

212
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:36,390
I tell you,chicks cannot hold their hot sauce.

213
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:55,060
are we gonna be just like our parents?

214
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:09,550
- When you get old, you buy sags - And you can't find your pants

215
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:14,750
sometimes I feel so much pressure.

216
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:16,910
You know,with my music.

217
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:19,550
My counsin JJ is always telling me,

218
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:23,400
"You gotta be the best. You gotta be number one. Number one!"

219
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:27,440
And I wanna tell him, hey man, get off my chiz.

220
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:28,670
But he drives me to school,

221
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:30,570
and I don't wanna blow my ride.

222
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:35,610

223
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:41,040

224
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:47,670

I can't believe I'm doing this...

229
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:20,430
that was amazing.

230
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:24,200
You learn that from your daddy?

231
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:28,630
Your daddy know how to shoot a bow and arrow with his foot?

232
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,370
I'm sorry, did I miss something?

233
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,550

234
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:39,740

Cause my dad can't do anything with his feet!

238
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:48,900
That is not my fault.

240
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:54,950
As teenagers,we are all under too much pressure!!!

00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:15,770
Robbie.

242
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:18,470
You're gonna look a lot better

243
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:19,840
without these balck curls in your hair.

244
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:22,730
