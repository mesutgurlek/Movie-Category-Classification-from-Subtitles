1
00:00:04,001 --> 00:00:25,668
Dr. Muhammad Awais Amin

2
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:25,668
All right,
get out of there.

3
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:30,214
Let's go.

4
00:02:09,004 --> 00:02:10,880
All the way down
and take a seat.

5
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:15,426
Let's go. Stop your
dragging. Let's go! Move!

6
00:02:20,724 --> 00:02:22,058
Let's go. Let's go.

7
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:18,030
Let's go! Line up! Line up!
DIETRICH: Move! Move! Right turn!

8
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:25,204
Stay with me! PIERPONT:
Keep your head down!

9
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:26,789
Line up! Line up!

10
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:28,124
DIETRICH: Everybody ready?
Come on.

11
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,292
Line up!
Get off me!

12
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:32,587
Come on.
PIERPONT: One...

13
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:34,881
Now march us to the changing
rooms. ...two, three.

14
00:03:35,007 --> 00:03:36,507
Go. Let's go.
Line up!

15
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:41,137
I know you.

16
00:03:42,014 --> 00:03:45,808
You just got paroled out of
here. You didn't last very long.

17
00:03:46,602 --> 00:03:48,519
When was that?

18
00:03:48,604 --> 00:03:50,146
Eight weeks ago.

19
00:03:51,315 --> 00:03:52,857
Did nine years.

20
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:55,359
John. John Dillinger.

21
00:03:55,444 --> 00:03:56,777
That's right.

22
00:03:57,571 --> 00:03:58,988
My friends call me John.

23
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:04,160
But a son-of-a-bitch screw like you
better address me as Mr. Dillinger.

24
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:10,333
Open it! Open it or
I'll blow you in half.

25
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:13,461
Against the wall.

26
00:04:17,633 --> 00:04:21,177
Take your
clothes off, now!

27
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:22,970
DIETRICH: You did it, kid.

28
00:04:23,055 --> 00:04:24,180
Sure did, Walter.

29
00:04:27,351 --> 00:04:28,517
Give me
the goddamn jacket.

30
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:29,727
Red!

31
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:45,576
Come on. Hurry up! PIERPONT: Get
undressed. Take your clothes off.

32
00:04:45,661 --> 00:04:46,786
Come on.

33
00:04:48,664 --> 00:04:50,414
You eyeballing me,
you son of a bitch?

34
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:52,875
Cut it out,
Shouse!

35
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,336
Shouse! Shouse!

36
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:06,055
Lockdown!

37
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:12,979
Bring them in
from the yard!

38
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:24,365
There they are!

39
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:54,437
Walter! Come on.

40
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,480
Walter Dietrich's dead
'cause of you.

41
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:40,274
The bastard guard wouldn't
do what he was told, Johnny.

42
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,069
Homer?

43
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:44,695
Just let him
have it, Johnny.

44
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:45,780
Pete?

45
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:47,239
It's up to you.

46
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:13,891
How far is the farm?

47
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:15,976
3.2 miles.

48
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,087
We're ready!

49
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:45,214
Okay. Let's go!

50
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:49,218
Burn these,
okay, honey?

51
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:52,096
Thanks for
getting us out, Red.

52
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,305
It was Johnny's plan.

53
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,640
Yeah, but thanks.

54
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,109
Take me with you, mister.

55
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:08,028
I can't, darling.
I'm sorry.

56
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:29,842
Welcome back, Pete.

57
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,597
Let's go to Chicago
and make some money.

58
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,219
Floyd, halt!

59
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:54,635
Melvin, look out!

60
00:09:59,391 --> 00:10:02,101
Pretty Boy Floyd,
you are under arrest.

61
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:05,062
It's Charles.
Charles Floyd.

62
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:10,526
Who are you? Melvin Purvis,
Bureau of Investigation.

63
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:13,445
Where is your friend,
Harry Campbell?

64
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:16,282
I believe
you've killed me.

65
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:20,286
So you can go
rot in hell.

66
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:01,702
Sport.

67
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,338
Red, call Oscar.
Okay.

68
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:17,092
Hi, there, doll.
Let's switch out the shorts.

69
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:18,302
We gonna
use Berman?

70
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:20,763
Yeah. Get a Plymouth
and an Essex.

71
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:24,266
Where them other gals?

72
00:11:24,768 --> 00:11:26,352
You get a hold of Marty?
Sure did.

73
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:27,478
How you doing,
Mr. Johnny?

74
00:11:27,562 --> 00:11:28,729
Doing great, Sport.

75
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:40,866
The main spring's too tight
on this one. Jammed twice.

76
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:42,993
I cut off
one coil.

77
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:50,000
And it rides up
and to the right.

78
00:11:50,085 --> 00:11:51,794
I widen port.

79
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:02,679
Hey, Red.
Hi, Harry.

80
00:12:05,517 --> 00:12:07,393
Harry, this is Pete.
Pete, this is Harry Berman.

81
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:08,977
Hi, Pete.
How you doing?

82
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:11,563
So, what do we got? Got a
couple of nice straight eights.

83
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:14,400
Bored them out. Rebuilt
the carburetors myself.

84
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:15,984
These are some
really fast cars.

85
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:17,778
Perfect work cars for
a couple of gentlemen.

86
00:12:20,115 --> 00:12:21,865
Johnny, how are you?
Good.

87
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:26,370
Marty,

88
00:12:27,956 --> 00:12:30,332
tell me that me
and my boys are okay.

89
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:31,583
As long as you stay
in East Chicago,

90
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:34,086
you're in safe haven,
any time you want.

91
00:12:36,131 --> 00:12:37,756
Extra cake's in here.

92
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:38,966
Thanks.

93
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:40,843
Hey, Anna.

94
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:45,055
I opened up in Chicago on Halsted
now. Come by and see the girls.

95
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:04,491
PIERPONT: How are you?

96
00:13:05,869 --> 00:13:11,665
On the floor! Now! Now! Do it!
Do it! On the floor, now! Now!

97
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:15,002
Let's play a game, Mr. President.
It's called Spin the Dial.

98
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:17,880
PIERPONT: You, hands up!
Come on. And, you, sit down!

99
00:13:19,883 --> 00:13:21,133
On the floor!

100
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:22,718
Relax, pops.

101
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:26,722
Open it up.

102
00:13:26,848 --> 00:13:30,309
Empty it! Move, move!
Shut up!

103
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:31,852
It's one of these.

104
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:38,066
You can be a dead hero
or a live coward.

105
00:13:39,611 --> 00:13:41,361
Get it open.
All of it!

106
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:43,947
PIERPONT: You, hands up.
Come on!

107
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:46,783
Empty it! All of it!

108
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:48,660
PIERPONT: Hey, sit down!

109
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:49,953
Push it to me!

110
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:54,082
And don't move!

111
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:10,557
PIERPONT: We got company!

112
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:22,778
Move out of there!

113
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:36,625
You can put it away. Not here for
your money. Here for the bank's money.

114
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,168
I said,
move it out of there!

115
00:14:38,253 --> 00:14:39,378
What for?

116
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,468
Come here, sister.
Let's take a ride.

117
00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:02,734
DETECTIVE: Get down!

118
00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:41,523
Beat it.
You, too, sister.

119
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:46,778
Come here.

120
00:15:54,037 --> 00:15:56,872
There you go, doll.
Something to remember me by.

121
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:05,047
You know, when I'm not doing
this, I'm a scout for the movies.

122
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,840
Really?

123
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:13,972
Join hands.

124
00:16:14,057 --> 00:16:15,098
We'll freeze here!

125
00:16:15,183 --> 00:16:18,226
No. You'll worm your way out
of there in about 10 minutes.

126
00:16:42,085 --> 00:16:43,126
Why do we
need this?

127
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:46,296
Because criminals flee in fast
automobiles across state lines,

128
00:16:46,381 --> 00:16:47,839
thereby defeating
local jurisdiction

129
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:50,217
because there is no federal
police force to stop them.

130
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:52,511
By my tally, your
Bureau wants to spend

131
00:16:52,595 --> 00:16:54,805
more taxpayers' dollars
catching crooks

132
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:57,349
than what the crooks you
catch stole in the first place.

133
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:59,393
Well, that's ridiculous.
The Bureau has apprehended

134
00:16:59,477 --> 00:17:00,811
kidnappers and
bank robbers who have

135
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:03,146
stolen up to and in excess of... Really?

136
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:06,358
How many have you
apprehended?

137
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:09,778
We have arrested and
arraigned 213 wanted felons.

138
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:12,364
No, I mean you, Director
Hoover. How many?

139
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,282
Well, as Director,
I administer.

140
00:17:15,118 --> 00:17:17,452
How many have you
arrested personally?

141
00:17:22,417 --> 00:17:24,376
I have never
arrested anybody.

142
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:27,796
You've never
arrested anybody.

143
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,464
Well, of course not.
I am an administrator.

144
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:31,633
With no field experience.

145
00:17:32,343 --> 00:17:35,345
You are shockingly
unqualified, aren't you, sir?

146
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:37,431
You have never
personally conducted

147
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:40,267
a criminal investigation
in the field in your life.

148
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:42,477
I think you're a front.

149
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:46,815
I think your prowess
as a lawman is a myth

150
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:50,610
created from the hoopla of headlines
by Mr. Suydam, your publicist there.

151
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:53,864
Crimebusters, G-men, you're
setting yourself up as a czar?

152
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:56,116
That's running wild
in my estimation.

153
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,659
A crime is what
runs wild.

154
00:17:57,744 --> 00:18:00,245
If this country requires
a Bureau such as yours,

155
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:02,789
I question whether you are
the person fit to run it.

156
00:18:02,874 --> 00:18:06,418
Well, I will not be judged by a
kangaroo court of venal politicians.

157
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:08,879
Your appropriation
increase is denied.

158
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:20,640
Feed the following
to Walter Winchell.

159
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:25,270
McKellar is a Neanderthal, and he is
on a personal vendetta to destroy me.

160
00:18:26,022 --> 00:18:27,522
We will not contest him
in his committee room.

161
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:29,483
We will fight him
on the front page.

162
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:32,194
Where is John Dillinger?

163
00:18:41,204 --> 00:18:43,455
Agent Purvis,
congratulations.

164
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:45,123
Thank you, sir.

165
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:47,167
May I ask why?
They're ready for him.

166
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:49,836
This is Henry Suydam. He is
our expert in press relations.

167
00:18:49,921 --> 00:18:52,589
Congratulations
for Pretty Boy Floyd,

168
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:54,925
for which you have
my personal gratitude.

169
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:57,010
Second, you are,
as of this moment,

170
00:18:57,094 --> 00:19:00,013
the Special Agent in Charge
of the Chicago field office.

171
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:01,932
Are you up to that
task, Agent Purvis?

172
00:19:02,016 --> 00:19:03,517
Absolutely, sir.

173
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:09,815
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

174
00:19:10,441 --> 00:19:16,071
Today, I am declaring the United
States of America's first War on Crime.

175
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:22,536
And I'd like to introduce one of our
finest G-men, Agent Melvin Purvis.

176
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,580
Agent Purvis will be in charge
of the field office in Chicago,

177
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:28,416
the center of the crime
wave sweeping America.

178
00:19:28,626 --> 00:19:32,879
His task will be to get Public
Enemy Number One, John Dillinger.

179
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:35,340
Director?
Mr. Purvis?

180
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:36,800
Say a few words,
would you?

181
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:43,515
Mr. Purvis, how did you
run down Pretty Boy Floyd?

182
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:48,019
Through an apple orchard.

183
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:52,399
Mr. Tolson, when he's done, you
tell him if he needs anything,

184
00:19:52,483 --> 00:19:54,276
you'll get it for him.

185
00:19:55,278 --> 00:19:57,279
And tell him
he may call me J. E.

186
00:19:57,363 --> 00:20:00,532
Yeah, but people say John Dillinger's
a lot smarter and a lot tougher.

187
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:03,201
Well, nevertheless,
we will get him.

188
00:20:03,286 --> 00:20:04,911
What makes
you so sure?

189
00:20:04,996 --> 00:20:06,872
We have two things
Dillinger does not.

190
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:08,039
What are they?

191
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:12,002
The Bureau's modern techniques
of fighting crime scientifically

192
00:20:12,086 --> 00:20:13,795
and the visionary
leadership

193
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,630
of our Director,
J. Edgar Hoover.

194
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:23,763
The broad over there is looking at me.

195
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:25,307
She likes me.

196
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:27,183
How you doing,
sweetheart?

197
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:51,750
Alvin.
Good to see you.

198
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:53,084
How you doing?

199
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:54,461
Homer. Pete.

200
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:00,926
Me, Freddy and Doc are
looking to snatch a fellow.

201
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:05,347
He's a Saint Paul banker, Ed
Bremer. We need a few more hands.

202
00:21:06,724 --> 00:21:08,183
I don't like kidnapping.

203
00:21:08,935 --> 00:21:11,519
Well, robbing banks
is getting tougher.

204
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:13,605
The public don't
like kidnapping.

205
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:15,732
Who gives a damn
what the public likes?

206
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:17,567
I do.
I hide out among them.

207
00:21:17,652 --> 00:21:19,319
We gotta care
what they think.

208
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:21,863
We also got a mail train
we're looking at, too.

209
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:26,451
By the way, if somebody was to get
pinched, who knows their way around?

210
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:32,040
Syndicate lawyer named Piquett,
Louis Piquett. We all use him.

211
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,875
What's it all about,
this train?

212
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:36,711
Needs two or three more real
right guys to stick it up.

213
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:38,463
Be ready in
a couple of months.

214
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:43,218
About $1,700,000. It's a
Federal Reserve shipment.

215
00:21:44,345 --> 00:21:46,596
It's the kind of score
you go away on after.

216
00:21:47,682 --> 00:21:49,015
Where you gonna go?

217
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:53,603
I don't know. Brazil,
Cuba. I like Varadero Beach.

218
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:55,480
What about you?

219
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:57,565
No plans.

220
00:21:58,067 --> 00:21:59,526
Yeah, well,
you ought to.

221
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:02,487
What we're doing
won't last forever.

222
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:04,739
We're having too
good a time today.

223
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:06,908
We ain't thinking
about tomorrow.

224
00:22:08,619 --> 00:22:11,830
Keep me in mind on the train,
would you? All right. Thanks.

225
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:16,918
You know how much they made
taking that Hamm Brewery guy?

226
00:22:17,003 --> 00:22:19,087
$100,000.
Simmer down, Homer.

227
00:22:19,547 --> 00:22:22,007
Come on, fellas.
Let's go to the bar.

228
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:24,009
I got three broads
convinced I own the place.

229
00:22:25,261 --> 00:22:26,553
See you.

230
00:22:30,224 --> 00:22:31,933
Is Homer staying
steady enough?

231
00:22:32,935 --> 00:22:34,144
Homer's fine.

232
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:36,896
One rule I learned
from Walter Dietrich,

233
00:22:36,981 --> 00:22:38,648
never work with people
who are desperate.

234
00:22:38,733 --> 00:22:41,443
Yeah, well, I got a rule,
too. Stay away from the women.

235
00:22:45,448 --> 00:22:47,490
Without women, it's
like back in the stir.

236
00:22:47,825 --> 00:22:49,701
That's why they
invented whores.

237
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:52,579
Hey, hey, Anna.

238
00:22:52,663 --> 00:22:54,247
How are you doing,
big boy?

239
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:56,207
Who's this?
Veronica.

240
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:57,751
Veronica, Red.

241
00:22:57,835 --> 00:22:59,627
Hi, Johnny.
Hey, Anna.

242
00:23:21,484 --> 00:23:24,069
I don't know why you gave
that fellow the go-by,

243
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:28,156
but I'm awful glad
you did.

244
00:23:29,158 --> 00:23:30,408
What's your name?

245
00:23:30,493 --> 00:23:31,618
Billie Frechette.

246
00:23:34,497 --> 00:23:35,705
Can I buy you a drink?

247
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:36,915
Okay.

248
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:42,712
You got a name?

249
00:23:45,466 --> 00:23:46,549
Yeah.

250
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:49,511
Jack.
You dance, Jack?

251
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:52,722
I don't know how.

252
00:23:54,016 --> 00:23:55,058
Come on.

253
00:23:57,603 --> 00:23:59,562
How come you don't
know how to dance?

254
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:01,856
Frechette.

255
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:03,900
That French?

256
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:07,862
On my father's side.
There's an "e" at the end.

257
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:09,864
This is a two-step.

258
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:12,033
Blackbird

259
00:24:15,371 --> 00:24:19,499
Where somebody waits for me

260
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:26,548
Sugar's sweet, so is he

261
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:34,639
Daddy's French.
What's on the other side?

262
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:40,395
My mama's
a Menominee Indian, okay?

263
00:24:41,063 --> 00:24:42,814
Most men don't like that.

264
00:24:45,401 --> 00:24:46,484
I ain't most men.

265
00:24:46,569 --> 00:24:47,652
Yeah?

266
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:52,282
And I've been a dice girl, and I
check coats at the Steuben Club.

267
00:24:57,663 --> 00:24:59,080
And what do you do?

268
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:03,501
I'm catching up.

269
00:25:06,589 --> 00:25:08,089
Meeting somebody
like you,

270
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:11,342
dark and beautiful,

271
00:25:14,555 --> 00:25:16,055
like that bird
in that song.

272
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:22,395
Blackbird, bye-bye

273
00:25:24,148 --> 00:25:28,610
No one here can love

274
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:34,532
Or understand me

275
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:40,163
You cold?

276
00:26:05,231 --> 00:26:07,482
What is it exactly
you do for a living?

277
00:26:09,777 --> 00:26:11,778
I'm John Dillinger.
I rob banks.

278
00:26:15,658 --> 00:26:18,243
That's where all these
people here put their money.

279
00:26:20,162 --> 00:26:21,788
Why did you
tell me that?

280
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:24,958
You could have
made up a story.

281
00:26:25,042 --> 00:26:26,584
I'm not gonna
lie to you.

282
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:31,089
That's a serious thing to
say to a girl you just met.

283
00:26:31,173 --> 00:26:32,340
I know you.

284
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:33,967
Well, I don't know you.

285
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:37,428
I haven't been anyplace.

286
00:26:37,513 --> 00:26:39,847
Well, some of the places
I've been ain't so hot.

287
00:26:42,184 --> 00:26:44,477
Where I'm going is
a whole lot better.

288
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:46,771
Want to come along?

289
00:26:47,356 --> 00:26:49,190
Boy, you are in a hurry!

290
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:53,069
If you were looking at what I'm
looking at, you'd be in a hurry, too.

291
00:26:53,487 --> 00:26:54,612
Well,

292
00:26:55,406 --> 00:26:57,615
it's me they're
looking at this time.

293
00:26:58,367 --> 00:26:59,534
You're beautiful.

294
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:01,953
They're looking at me
because they're not used to

295
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:03,871
having a girl in
their restaurant

296
00:27:03,956 --> 00:27:05,707
in a $3 dress.

297
00:27:07,668 --> 00:27:08,835
Listen, doll.

298
00:27:09,795 --> 00:27:12,630
That's 'cause they're all
about where people come from.

299
00:27:14,216 --> 00:27:17,135
The only thing that's important
is where somebody's going.

300
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:20,513
Where are you going?

301
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:24,225
Anywhere I want.

302
00:27:32,318 --> 00:27:33,735
Let's get out of here.

303
00:27:46,332 --> 00:27:47,582
Hey, Johnny!

304
00:27:52,046 --> 00:27:53,463
Go wait for me outside.

305
00:28:02,473 --> 00:28:03,556
Gil.

306
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:08,603
Ever since I got out, I've
been working for Frank Nitti.

307
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:11,856
These guys are connected to
everybody all over the country now.

308
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,734
He looks like a barber.

309
00:28:27,164 --> 00:28:31,626
Phil D'Andrea. Every time I
read about one of your bank jobs

310
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:34,462
where you give the customers
back their money, you crack me up.

311
00:28:36,632 --> 00:28:38,841
You need anything,
ask Gilbert.

312
00:28:38,926 --> 00:28:40,551
Gilbert knows
how to find me.

313
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:42,136
Thank you.

314
00:28:58,487 --> 00:29:00,113
Where'd that girl go?
I don't know, sir.

315
00:29:00,197 --> 00:29:01,989
She jumped in a cab
and took off.

316
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:08,079
This is
Lowell Thomas.

317
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:09,789
From West Virginia
comes accusations

318
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:12,250
by the Carnegie CoaI company
of Red influence

319
00:29:12,334 --> 00:29:14,001
on the United Mine
Workers' strike.

320
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:17,630
Meanwhile, in Racine, Wisconsin,
after raiding the American Trust Bank,

321
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:20,007
Public Enemy Number One
John Dillinger

322
00:29:20,092 --> 00:29:23,094
roams the wilds pursued
by the hounds of justice.

323
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:24,679
And in Geneva,
the League of Nations

324
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:26,597
voted the USSR
full membership.

325
00:29:26,682 --> 00:29:29,559
According to the bank
teller, Barbara Patzke,

326
00:29:29,643 --> 00:29:31,978
this is
John Dillinger's coat.

327
00:29:32,062 --> 00:29:34,856
It's made by Shragge
Quality out of St. Louis.

328
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:39,569
Price, $35, windproof
32-ounce wool. Top stitching.

329
00:29:40,446 --> 00:29:41,821
Thank you, Agent Baum.

330
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:47,201
Agents in our offices
across the country

331
00:29:48,412 --> 00:29:52,248
are identifying every store in the
United States that sold this overcoat.

332
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:55,710
Then we will cross-reference
every Dillinger associate

333
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:58,337
at locales where
that coat was sold.

334
00:29:59,006 --> 00:30:00,298
He was in a place.

335
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:02,842
He got cold.
He bought a coat.

336
00:30:03,886 --> 00:30:05,678
Unless he was
traveling through,

337
00:30:06,847 --> 00:30:08,598
he was being
harbored nearby.

338
00:30:08,682 --> 00:30:10,349
If he returns,
we will be there.

339
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:16,939
It is by such methods that our
Bureau will get John Dillinger.

340
00:30:17,858 --> 00:30:19,859
Now, Doris,
would you please contact

341
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:23,237
the Chicago area telephone
exchange supervisors. There are six.

342
00:30:23,322 --> 00:30:25,448
Request appointments for
Carter Baum and myself.

343
00:30:27,201 --> 00:30:28,409
Gentlemen,

344
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:34,415
shortly you will be provided
Thompson submachine guns, BARs

345
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:37,585
and a.351 Winchester
semi-automatic rifle.

346
00:30:41,924 --> 00:30:45,760
We are pursuing hardened
killers. They will be dangerous.

347
00:30:46,929 --> 00:30:49,764
And those of you who aren't
prepared for that should go.

348
00:30:51,934 --> 00:30:54,227
And if you are going
to go, please go now.

349
00:30:58,357 --> 00:31:00,233
This is a phone call
conversation

350
00:31:00,317 --> 00:31:03,402
from a car dealership
from 27 minutes ago.

351
00:31:03,487 --> 00:31:04,487
Harry Berman.

352
00:31:05,364 --> 00:31:08,282
When you drop it, leave
the keys on the floorboard.

353
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:10,535
I got a DeSoto.
Okay.

354
00:31:10,619 --> 00:31:12,203
Interior's no good.

355
00:31:12,621 --> 00:31:13,955
How did we get
to Berman?

356
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:15,331
Off the Dillinger coat.

357
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:17,083
The coat was bought
in Cicero, lllinois,

358
00:31:17,167 --> 00:31:19,460
a few doors down from
Berman's dealership.

359
00:31:19,545 --> 00:31:23,381
Now, we know Berman. He's been supplying
cars to the Syndicate since Capone.

360
00:31:23,465 --> 00:31:25,258
When Dillinger
bought that coat,

361
00:31:25,342 --> 00:31:27,218
he must have been at
Berman's switching cars.

362
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:30,012
As soon as they call to drop
the DeSoto, we'll tail it.

363
00:31:30,097 --> 00:31:32,974
I want men on this
around the clock.

364
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:44,735
May I check
your coat, sir?

365
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,028
Yes, thank you.

366
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:49,156
You ran out on me.

367
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:51,033
You left me standing
on the sidewalk.

368
00:31:51,118 --> 00:31:52,577
If you're
gonna be my girl,

369
00:31:52,661 --> 00:31:55,913
you're gonna have to swear to me
that you'll never ever do that again.

370
00:31:55,998 --> 00:31:58,207
Hey, I'm not your girl.
Brown overcoat.

371
00:31:58,292 --> 00:31:59,584
And I'm not
gonna say that.

372
00:31:59,668 --> 00:32:01,752
I'm waiting.
So am I.

373
00:32:01,837 --> 00:32:05,131
"I'm never gonna run out on
you ever again. " Say the words.

374
00:32:05,215 --> 00:32:06,924
No.
My coat.

375
00:32:07,009 --> 00:32:09,218
Well, I ain't ever gonna run
out on you, and that's a promise.

376
00:32:09,303 --> 00:32:11,554
Well, I want to run
out of here, so, lady...

377
00:32:29,239 --> 00:32:31,824
Hit the road, sport.
Keep the tip.

378
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:36,787
You ain't getting other people's
hats and coats no more neither.

379
00:32:36,872 --> 00:32:38,122
Why'd you do that?

380
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:39,957
'Cause you're with me now.

381
00:32:40,042 --> 00:32:42,084
I don't know
anything about you.

382
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:44,795
I was raised on a farm
in Mooresville, Indiana.

383
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,005
My mama died
when I was three.

384
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:49,634
My daddy beat the hell out of me 'cause
he didn't know no better way to raise me.

385
00:32:49,718 --> 00:32:54,972
I like baseball, movies, good
clothes, fast cars, whiskey and you.

386
00:32:56,308 --> 00:32:57,975
What else
you need to know?

387
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:35,429
Have a seat.

388
00:33:38,225 --> 00:33:39,392
You been living here long?

389
00:33:39,476 --> 00:33:40,643
Yeah.

390
00:33:41,353 --> 00:33:42,603
Since yesterday.

391
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:47,900
Hey.

392
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:01,122
I got you something.

393
00:35:02,851 --> 00:35:04,018
BILLIE: When I was a girl,

394
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:06,604
we went to live on the
reservation in Flandreau

395
00:35:06,688 --> 00:35:08,522
'cause my daddy died.

396
00:35:10,734 --> 00:35:13,277
In Flandreau,
nothing ever happened.

397
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:17,782
And when I was 13, I went to live
in Milwaukee with my Aunt Ines.

398
00:35:19,993 --> 00:35:22,203
We had a lot of
Indian friends,

399
00:35:23,205 --> 00:35:26,165
and we went around to
churches and put on plays.

400
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,712
And nothing exciting ever
happened there, either.

401
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:36,801
So I haven't been anywhere or done
anything except come to Chicago

402
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:39,720
and try to make my way.

403
00:36:02,619 --> 00:36:04,161
You're all packed.

404
00:36:10,377 --> 00:36:11,544
Well, baby,

405
00:36:16,258 --> 00:36:17,967
I'm gonna
take you with me.

406
00:36:21,847 --> 00:36:25,057
And you're gonna start a whole
new exciting kind of life.

407
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:32,898
And what do you want?

408
00:36:36,778 --> 00:36:38,112
Everything.

409
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:42,658
Right now.

410
00:36:49,291 --> 00:36:50,708
Purvis.

411
00:36:50,792 --> 00:36:54,086
Berman dropped the DeSoto at
Sherone Apartments 20 minutes ago.

412
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:58,757
Men go in and out of an apartment
rented to a Miss Vi Scott.

413
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:02,344
They carry heavy suitcases. One
of them looks like Dillinger.

414
00:37:10,312 --> 00:37:11,395
Where are your men?

415
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:13,564
In cars on Clarendon
and Wilson Avenue.

416
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:15,149
Blocking vehicles?
The alley?

417
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:18,444
Who has a line of sight
on the DeSoto to you?

418
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:28,621
Are they aware that we are
here? Any rapid movements?

419
00:37:28,705 --> 00:37:29,830
No.

420
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:33,167
Carter,

421
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:37,421
you keep an eye on
the DeSoto from there.

422
00:37:41,301 --> 00:37:42,843
Barton, you're with me.

423
00:38:13,667 --> 00:38:14,792
Yes?

424
00:38:16,211 --> 00:38:19,380
I'm Special Agent Melvin
Purvis, Miss Scott.

425
00:38:20,173 --> 00:38:21,173
Are you here
by yourself?

426
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:23,467
No. I'm here
with my fiancé.

427
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:24,969
And what is
your fiancé's name?

428
00:38:25,053 --> 00:38:27,096
Leonard McHenry.

429
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:30,641
May we come in?

430
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:31,809
Well, please.

431
00:38:31,893 --> 00:38:33,769
I'm perfectly safe,
but come on in.

432
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:39,316
Something wrong?

433
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:41,819
You have identification?

434
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:44,530
Yeah, sure.

435
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:48,617
Honey, would you get my driver's
license? It's in my jacket pocket.

436
00:38:48,702 --> 00:38:49,743
Sure.

437
00:38:50,996 --> 00:38:52,121
I know you.

438
00:38:53,123 --> 00:38:54,289
You're...

439
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:56,792
You're Melvin Purvis.
Right?

440
00:38:58,044 --> 00:39:00,295
Yeah. I seen your picture.

441
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,882
And what do you do
for a living, Leonard?

442
00:39:04,426 --> 00:39:05,968
I travel
in ladies' shoes.

443
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:08,679
Show him, honey.

444
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:11,849
Cute, huh?

445
00:39:15,687 --> 00:39:19,606
Well, you enjoy the rest
of your dinner, Mr. McHenry.

446
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,734
Thanks.
Good night.

447
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:33,662
No one in or out. I'll get
the others. You stay here.

448
00:39:33,747 --> 00:39:36,123
You watch that door
from right there.

449
00:39:42,297 --> 00:39:43,756
Get the men
from Sheridan.

450
00:40:13,328 --> 00:40:16,663
Bureau of Investigation.
What's your name?

451
00:40:18,208 --> 00:40:19,666
You wanna know
my name?

452
00:40:28,009 --> 00:40:29,176
Come on.

453
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:33,388
Baum, you keep an eye
on the alley.

454
00:40:45,193 --> 00:40:46,401
Barton?

455
00:40:48,321 --> 00:40:49,446
Barton.

456
00:41:29,529 --> 00:41:30,988
Where is he?

457
00:41:42,167 --> 00:41:43,584
They're headed east!

458
00:41:44,252 --> 00:41:45,752
Who was in
the blocking car?

459
00:41:45,837 --> 00:41:47,171
That was us.

460
00:41:49,257 --> 00:41:52,092
We heard gunfire
so we came here.

461
00:41:54,971 --> 00:41:56,638
Who was it?
Dillinger?

462
00:42:00,268 --> 00:42:03,020
The man we let get away
wasn't John Dillinger.

463
00:42:03,104 --> 00:42:05,063
That was Baby Face Nelson.

464
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:32,841
Get on the floor!
Now! Go!

465
00:42:32,926 --> 00:42:34,301
Y'all get up
against that wall.

466
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:36,428
Go on, all of you. PIERPONT:
This is a stick-up! Up!

467
00:42:36,596 --> 00:42:38,388
Put them up! Up!

468
00:42:38,473 --> 00:42:40,015
Down on the floor,
now! Down!

469
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:41,600
Put them up! Come on.
Put them up!

470
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:43,101
This is a stick-up!

471
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:45,145
Let's go. Come on.
Up!

472
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:46,855
Where I can
see them, up!

473
00:42:47,899 --> 00:42:50,484
Customers, stay calm.
Don't move.

474
00:42:51,778 --> 00:42:53,153
Hey! You! Up!

475
00:42:54,489 --> 00:42:57,824
Hands up!
Move! Empty it!

476
00:42:59,077 --> 00:43:01,662
John Dillinger held up
a bank for $74,000

477
00:43:01,746 --> 00:43:03,956
while you failed
to arrest Nelson.

478
00:43:04,374 --> 00:43:06,166
Sir, I take
full responsibility.

479
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:09,586
And I would like
to make a request.

480
00:43:09,963 --> 00:43:12,506
That we transfer men with
special qualifications

481
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:14,508
to augment the staff
here in Chicago.

482
00:43:14,801 --> 00:43:16,593
There are some former
Texas and Oklahoma lawmen

483
00:43:16,678 --> 00:43:18,887
currently with
the Bureau in Dallas.

484
00:43:19,681 --> 00:43:22,015
I thought you understood
what I'm building.

485
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,644
A modern force of professional
young men of the best sort.

486
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:29,481
I'm afraid our type
cannot get the job done.

487
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:31,650
Excuse me,
I cannot hear you.

488
00:43:31,734 --> 00:43:34,611
Our type cannot
get the job done.

489
00:43:34,696 --> 00:43:36,071
I cannot hear you.

490
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:39,741
Our type cannot
get the job done.

491
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:42,202
Without qualified help,

492
00:43:43,496 --> 00:43:44,746
I would have to resign
this appointment.

493
00:43:44,831 --> 00:43:47,124
Otherwise, I am leading
my men to slaughter.

494
00:43:50,503 --> 00:43:52,671
Mr. Tolson will call you,
Agent Purvis.

495
00:44:22,827 --> 00:44:24,077
Did he say what
he looked like?

496
00:44:24,162 --> 00:44:25,370
Didn't say.

497
00:44:25,455 --> 00:44:26,496
You gentlemen
need any help?

498
00:44:26,581 --> 00:44:27,664
Thank you, no.

499
00:44:44,057 --> 00:44:45,390
WINSTEAD: Shine?
Morning.

500
00:44:45,475 --> 00:44:47,434
How you doing?
I'm doing all right.

501
00:44:51,147 --> 00:44:52,564
Agent Winstead?

502
00:44:53,149 --> 00:44:54,941
That's right.
It's a pleasure.

503
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:59,071
Welcome to Chicago. We have a lot
of work to do here on Mr. Dillinger.

504
00:44:59,155 --> 00:45:00,947
Another time.
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

505
00:45:01,032 --> 00:45:02,240
Have a nice day.

506
00:45:23,471 --> 00:45:26,973
Put Johnny Patton down front
on the other four tracks.

507
00:45:30,061 --> 00:45:31,103
It's hot out, right?

508
00:45:31,187 --> 00:45:32,604
Yes, Frank.

509
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:35,524
Ever since those pricks
shot me, I can't get warm.

510
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:39,403
What?

511
00:45:39,487 --> 00:45:41,279
Some people from
Chicago over there.

512
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:51,373
Johnny.

513
00:45:51,916 --> 00:45:53,834
What do you say we meet you
in Tucson around the 25th?

514
00:45:53,918 --> 00:45:55,502
Okay.
All right.

515
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:57,712
I heard one today.
Indiana paper,

516
00:45:57,797 --> 00:46:00,966
"Wanted, John Dillinger,
dead or dead. "

517
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:07,639
I think we wore out
the Midwest for a while.

518
00:46:12,186 --> 00:46:13,228
What?

519
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:16,940
Come out to the Colonial tonight.
It's our joint. Be my guest.

520
00:46:17,525 --> 00:46:19,276
The best steaks in Miami.

521
00:46:20,695 --> 00:46:21,945
You're not gonna
take our picture, are you?

522
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:23,697
No pictures.

523
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:25,198
All right.
We'll be there.

524
00:46:27,118 --> 00:46:29,077
Thank you for taking me
on this trip.

525
00:46:30,371 --> 00:46:32,664
You going somewhere,
doll? Am I?

526
00:46:33,541 --> 00:46:35,584
No.
Don't kid a kidder.

527
00:46:35,668 --> 00:46:37,794
Then don't play me
for a fool.

528
00:46:37,879 --> 00:46:40,881
We both know I end up back
checking coats at the Steuben Club,

529
00:46:40,965 --> 00:46:42,299
one way or the other.

530
00:46:42,383 --> 00:46:43,675
What does that mean?

531
00:46:43,885 --> 00:46:47,304
You don't think past today
or tomorrow. And eventually,

532
00:46:47,388 --> 00:46:48,972
they will catch you
or kill you

533
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:51,516
and I don't want to be
there when that happens.

534
00:46:52,768 --> 00:46:53,935
Who gave you
a crystal ball?

535
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:55,812
I don't need one.

536
00:46:55,897 --> 00:46:57,272
Ask Homer.

537
00:46:58,191 --> 00:46:59,232
Ask Homer what?

538
00:46:59,317 --> 00:47:01,902
And his goddamn joke,
"dead or dead. "

539
00:47:07,283 --> 00:47:09,910
You ain't going nowhere,
you hear me?

540
00:47:10,328 --> 00:47:12,370
I'm gonna die an old man
in your arms.

541
00:47:12,914 --> 00:47:14,372
We're too good for them.

542
00:47:15,082 --> 00:47:17,709
They ain't tough enough,
smart enough or fast enough.

543
00:47:18,461 --> 00:47:20,337
I hit any bank
I want any time.

544
00:47:20,421 --> 00:47:23,632
They got to be at
every bank all the time.

545
00:47:25,134 --> 00:47:27,052
That's why we're
on top of the world.

546
00:47:27,887 --> 00:47:29,638
Ain't nobody
lay a glove on us.

547
00:47:30,515 --> 00:47:31,681
No.

548
00:47:32,934 --> 00:47:36,353
I ain't going nowhere.
Neither are you.

549
00:47:37,355 --> 00:47:38,939
What do you got
to say about that?

550
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:15,934
Hi, folks.

551
00:48:16,352 --> 00:48:19,771
Afternoon. Got a reservation for
a Mr. and Mrs. Frank Sullivan.

552
00:48:24,652 --> 00:48:27,112
I can send up some sandwiches
and beer if you like.

553
00:48:27,196 --> 00:48:28,488
That'd be swell.

554
00:48:28,990 --> 00:48:30,574
Some friends of mine
should be here already,

555
00:48:30,658 --> 00:48:32,659
a J.C. Davies
and a Mr. Clark?

556
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:35,036
Out shopping, I believe.

557
00:48:35,121 --> 00:48:36,621
I'll let them know you're
in when they get back.

558
00:48:36,706 --> 00:48:37,831
Okey-doke.

559
00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:42,419
The elevator's
right down that way.

560
00:48:42,503 --> 00:48:43,962
Thank you very much.

561
00:49:18,331 --> 00:49:20,415
You look like you
could use some company.

562
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:25,170
How's about me and my friend Prince
Albert come and pay you a visit?

563
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:29,507
Get on in here,
both of you.

564
00:49:38,601 --> 00:49:42,145
BILLIE: Johnny! Johnny!

565
00:49:45,566 --> 00:49:47,275
Put some clothes on, miss.

566
00:49:52,573 --> 00:49:54,115
What the hell
happened, boys?

567
00:49:54,784 --> 00:49:56,660
There was a fire
in the hotel.

568
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:02,165
Firemen found our guns.
They called the cops.

569
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:03,291
Where they taking you?

570
00:50:03,376 --> 00:50:04,876
We're getting
shanghaied to Ohio.

571
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,086
Where's Billie?

572
00:50:15,596 --> 00:50:18,014
Your girl's been put on
a bus back to Chicago.

573
00:50:18,099 --> 00:50:19,849
We ain't holding her.

574
00:50:41,122 --> 00:50:42,455
Right this way.

575
00:50:53,551 --> 00:50:54,759
Well,

576
00:50:57,805 --> 00:51:00,306
here's the man who
killed Pretty Boy Floyd.

577
00:51:01,517 --> 00:51:04,811
Damn good thing he was pretty,
'cause he sure wasn't Whiz Kid Floyd.

578
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:12,485
Tell me something,
Mr. Purvis.

579
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:16,156
That fellow, the one who got
killed at the Sherone Apartments,

580
00:51:19,118 --> 00:51:21,327
the newspaper said
you found him alive.

581
00:51:24,957 --> 00:51:26,416
It's the eyes,
ain't it?

582
00:51:28,627 --> 00:51:30,587
They look at you
right before they go.

583
00:51:34,550 --> 00:51:38,178
And then they just
drift away into nothing.

584
00:51:43,058 --> 00:51:44,809
That'll keep
you up nights.

585
00:51:47,646 --> 00:51:49,856
And what keeps you up
nights, Mr. Dillinger?

586
00:51:54,487 --> 00:51:55,695
Coffee.

587
00:52:02,369 --> 00:52:05,079
You act like a confident
man, Mr. Purvis.

588
00:52:05,164 --> 00:52:06,706
You got a few qualities.

589
00:52:07,166 --> 00:52:09,459
Probably pretty good
from a distance,

590
00:52:09,543 --> 00:52:11,961
especially when you got
the fellow outnumbered.

591
00:52:12,046 --> 00:52:13,713
But up close,
toe to toe,

592
00:52:14,381 --> 00:52:17,383
when somebody's about to
die right here, right now,

593
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:21,888
I'm used to that.

594
00:52:23,516 --> 00:52:24,724
What about you?

595
00:52:25,726 --> 00:52:27,060
Goodbye, Mr. Dillinger.

596
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:29,854
I'll see you
down the road.

597
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:34,692
No, you will not.

598
00:52:37,238 --> 00:52:39,072
The only way that you
will leave a jail cell

599
00:52:39,156 --> 00:52:41,616
is when we take you out
to execute you.

600
00:52:44,453 --> 00:52:46,454
Well, we'll see
about that.

601
00:52:49,542 --> 00:52:52,001
You ought to get yourself
another line of work, Melvin.

602
00:53:02,346 --> 00:53:05,139
Hey, I was just kidding.

603
00:53:05,975 --> 00:53:08,309
I believe I'm gonna let you
boys keep me here a while.

604
00:53:10,229 --> 00:53:13,398
We'd like that, Johnny, but
don't get too comfortable.

605
00:53:14,066 --> 00:53:15,483
They're moving you.

606
00:53:15,568 --> 00:53:16,568
Where to?

607
00:53:16,652 --> 00:53:17,944
Indiana.

608
00:53:19,488 --> 00:53:20,655
Why?

609
00:53:21,782 --> 00:53:24,617
I have absolutely nothing
I want to do in Indiana.

610
00:56:09,783 --> 00:56:10,950
He's here.

611
00:56:16,749 --> 00:56:18,916
Back up, fellas.
Back up.

612
00:56:24,423 --> 00:56:27,467
We'll take custody now.
Take the manacles off.

613
00:56:35,476 --> 00:56:36,893
Are you glad
to see Indiana again?

614
00:56:36,977 --> 00:56:38,895
About as glad as Indiana
is to see me, I suppose.

615
00:56:40,105 --> 00:56:42,398
Did you smuggle the guns into
Indiana State Penitentiary

616
00:56:42,483 --> 00:56:44,233
for the big break
of September 26th?

617
00:56:44,318 --> 00:56:46,486
Right now, you're
too inquisitive, buddy.

618
00:56:47,321 --> 00:56:48,738
Put your arm
around Dillinger.

619
00:56:52,659 --> 00:56:54,994
Hey, when was the last time
you were in Mooresville?

620
00:56:55,996 --> 00:56:57,288
Ten years ago.

621
00:56:58,415 --> 00:57:01,834
I was a wild boy, and,
well, I was foolish.

622
00:57:02,795 --> 00:57:03,836
I held up a grocery store,

623
00:57:03,921 --> 00:57:07,173
which I never should have done
'cause Mr. Morgan was a good man.

624
00:57:07,883 --> 00:57:12,345
And they sentenced me to 10 years in
the state penitentiary for a $50 theft.

625
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:18,142
When I was in prison,
I met a lot of good fellows.

626
00:57:18,977 --> 00:57:20,269
So sure, yeah,

627
00:57:21,230 --> 00:57:23,981
I helped set up the break
at Michigan City. Why not?

628
00:57:24,525 --> 00:57:27,026
I stick with my pals
and my pals stick with me.

629
00:57:27,402 --> 00:57:30,071
Johnny, how long does it
take you to go through a bank?

630
00:57:31,156 --> 00:57:35,076
Oh, about one minute,
40 seconds.

631
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:36,119
Flat.

632
00:57:38,205 --> 00:57:39,288
Let's go.

633
00:58:00,853 --> 00:58:02,603
Mr. Johnny,
your lawyer's here.

634
00:58:19,246 --> 00:58:22,206
You come highly
recommended by Alvin Karpis.

635
00:58:23,667 --> 00:58:26,002
At the arraignment,

636
00:58:26,086 --> 00:58:29,297
they're gonna try and
transfer me to the state pen.

637
00:58:30,883 --> 00:58:32,216
What can you do for me?

638
00:58:32,926 --> 00:58:34,468
What's on your mind?

639
00:58:36,054 --> 00:58:37,430
The electric chair.

640
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:54,113
Your Honor, are we to have an arraignment
in accord with the laws of this nation

641
00:58:54,198 --> 00:58:58,784
or is the State to be permitted to
incite an atmosphere of prejudice?

642
00:58:59,203 --> 00:59:03,164
The very air reeks with the
bloody rancor of intolerant malice!

643
00:59:03,582 --> 00:59:06,876
The clanging of shackles
brings to our minds

644
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,544
the dungeons of the czars,

645
00:59:08,629 --> 00:59:11,547
not the flag-bedecked liberty
of an American courtroom.

646
00:59:11,632 --> 00:59:15,009
I request the court to direct that
those shackles be removed forthwith.

647
00:59:15,093 --> 00:59:17,053
This is a very dangerous
man, Your Honor.

648
00:59:17,137 --> 00:59:18,930
And I'm responsible for the
safeguarding of this prisoner.

649
00:59:19,014 --> 00:59:22,391
Are you a lawyer? What right do
you have to address this court?

650
00:59:22,476 --> 00:59:26,270
All right. Remove the
shackles from the prisoner.

651
00:59:26,813 --> 00:59:30,233
Your Honor, we would like
to relocate the prisoner.

652
00:59:30,317 --> 00:59:32,693
Only Indiana State
Penitentiary in Michigan City

653
00:59:32,778 --> 00:59:35,196
can guarantee
Dillinger will not escape.

654
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:36,948
Sheriff Holley?
I concur, Your Honor.

655
00:59:37,032 --> 00:59:40,201
Sheriff Holley, I think this is a
very nice jail you have right here.

656
00:59:40,285 --> 00:59:42,411
What makes you think there's
something wrong with it?

657
00:59:42,496 --> 00:59:43,955
There's nothing
wrong with my jail.

658
00:59:44,039 --> 00:59:45,456
It's the strongest jail
in Indiana.

659
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:47,291
That's what I thought.

660
00:59:47,376 --> 00:59:50,211
But of course, I don't want
to embarrass Mrs. Holley.

661
00:59:50,504 --> 00:59:53,256
I appreciate she's a woman
and she's afraid of an escape.

662
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:55,174
Oh, no. I'm not afraid
of an escape.

663
00:59:55,259 --> 00:59:58,386
I can take care of John
Dillinger or any other prisoner.

664
01:00:00,847 --> 01:00:02,056
Okay.

665
01:00:02,724 --> 01:00:04,141
Dillinger will stay here.

666
01:00:04,226 --> 01:00:05,685
PIQUETT: Thank you,
Your Honor.

667
01:00:05,769 --> 01:00:08,980
The defense will need four
months to prepare itself.

668
01:00:09,064 --> 01:00:10,856
It should take 10 days.

669
01:00:10,941 --> 01:00:14,235
To go to trial in 10 days would
be a legal lynching of this lad.

670
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:15,569
There's a law
against lynching.

671
01:00:15,654 --> 01:00:16,821
There's a law
against murder!

672
01:00:16,905 --> 01:00:18,698
Then observe
the law part.

673
01:00:18,782 --> 01:00:22,285
Or just stand Dillinger
up against a wall

674
01:00:22,369 --> 01:00:25,079
and shoot him.
Just shoot him.

675
01:00:25,163 --> 01:00:27,999
Then there's no need to throw away
the State's money on this mockery.

676
01:00:28,083 --> 01:00:29,500
Calm down.

677
01:00:30,377 --> 01:00:32,086
I apologize to the court.

678
01:00:32,879 --> 01:00:35,214
Bob and I respect
each other very much.

679
01:00:36,883 --> 01:00:39,385
Watch out or he'll be putting
his arm around you, too.

680
01:00:41,805 --> 01:00:44,181
Trial starts in one
month on March 12th.

681
01:00:48,979 --> 01:00:50,271
Attaboy, counselor.

682
01:01:29,144 --> 01:01:30,311
Open the gate.

683
01:01:38,862 --> 01:01:40,112
Hey, Cahoon!

684
01:01:42,741 --> 01:01:44,116
Come here a minute.

685
01:01:48,288 --> 01:01:49,830
Come on, Sam.

686
01:01:50,749 --> 01:01:52,333
You and me's going places.

687
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:00,591
Call Bryant.

688
01:02:01,802 --> 01:02:02,968
Bryant?

689
01:02:15,816 --> 01:02:16,982
Call Max.

690
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:20,027
I'll kill you if I have
to. Don't think I won't.

691
01:02:22,489 --> 01:02:23,656
Open up!

692
01:03:03,905 --> 01:03:05,489
I'll plug him right here.

693
01:03:09,911 --> 01:03:13,622
Open the gun safe.
Go on. Open it up!

694
01:03:30,432 --> 01:03:31,640
Lock up the warden.

695
01:03:31,725 --> 01:03:33,392
That wasn't real, was it?

696
01:03:39,691 --> 01:03:40,900
Let's go.

697
01:04:03,632 --> 01:04:04,673
Put your hands up!

698
01:04:04,758 --> 01:04:06,675
Which one of these
here cars is the fastest?

699
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:09,220
That would be that Ford right
there. It's got the new V-8.

700
01:04:09,304 --> 01:04:11,138
We're gonna take
that one. Go on.

701
01:04:14,476 --> 01:04:17,228
That's Sheriff Lillian
Holley's personal car.

702
01:04:17,312 --> 01:04:18,437
Good.

703
01:05:40,186 --> 01:05:43,022
Mr. Youngblood,
are we clear now?

704
01:05:44,608 --> 01:05:45,774
We are.

705
01:05:58,788 --> 01:06:00,039
Okay, then.

706
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:03,208
Oh, come on, buddy.

707
01:06:05,295 --> 01:06:07,796
You gotta relax a little
bit. Just take it easy.

708
01:06:07,881 --> 01:06:11,050
Do you know the words
to The Last Round-Up?

709
01:06:12,761 --> 01:06:14,845
Get along,
little dogies

710
01:06:14,929 --> 01:06:16,764
Get along, get along

711
01:06:16,848 --> 01:06:19,558
Get along, little dogies
Get along

712
01:06:20,060 --> 01:06:24,146
Get along, little dogies
Get along, get along

713
01:06:24,898 --> 01:06:27,399
Get along, little dogies
Get along

714
01:06:29,069 --> 01:06:33,238
I'm a-headed for
the last round-up

715
01:06:34,324 --> 01:06:36,200
How did he act?
Was he jolly?

716
01:06:36,284 --> 01:06:38,077
Yes. He sang
part of the way.

717
01:06:39,329 --> 01:06:44,083
Get along, little dogies
Get along, get along

718
01:06:44,584 --> 01:06:47,503
While in Washington today,
President Roosevelt said,

719
01:06:47,587 --> 01:06:49,213
"John Dillinger
is making a mockery

720
01:06:49,297 --> 01:06:51,590
"of the system of justice
in this country. "

721
01:06:52,300 --> 01:06:55,844
The passing of John J. McGraw, long-time
manager of the New York Giants...

722
01:07:04,729 --> 01:07:07,272
Hello.
Hey, doll, it's me.

723
01:07:07,357 --> 01:07:09,149
Look, I can't talk long.
You okay?

724
01:07:09,234 --> 01:07:10,275
Yeah.

725
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:12,861
I heard it on the radio.
How about you?

726
01:07:13,113 --> 01:07:14,697
Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm fine.

727
01:07:15,448 --> 01:07:17,116
Don't come
to Chicago, Johnny.

728
01:07:18,201 --> 01:07:19,785
What's that
supposed to mean?

729
01:07:20,787 --> 01:07:22,329
I promised I'd look
after you, didn't I?

730
01:07:22,414 --> 01:07:23,622
Yes.

731
01:07:23,707 --> 01:07:24,998
Well, then that's
what I'm gonna do.

732
01:07:26,751 --> 01:07:28,043
You know that,
don't you?

733
01:07:28,336 --> 01:07:29,461
Yes.

734
01:07:31,464 --> 01:07:33,340
Look, I think
they're watching me.

735
01:07:35,135 --> 01:07:37,219
I'm gonna come get you out
of there and take care of you.

736
01:07:38,513 --> 01:07:39,847
Baby, don't come
to Chicago!

737
01:07:39,931 --> 01:07:41,181
Say you know it.

738
01:07:44,561 --> 01:07:45,978
Say it.

739
01:07:49,149 --> 01:07:50,899
I know you will
take care of me.

740
01:07:54,988 --> 01:07:56,071
I love you.

741
01:08:18,762 --> 01:08:20,512
Sooner or later,

742
01:08:21,639 --> 01:08:23,515
she will go to him

743
01:08:24,893 --> 01:08:26,852
or he is gonna
come for her.

744
01:08:46,706 --> 01:08:49,875
Say, Sport! Mr. Johnny, you
got to hold it right there.

745
01:08:54,798 --> 01:08:57,341
Can't stay here
no more, Mr. Johnny.

746
01:09:00,428 --> 01:09:01,637
Says who?

747
01:09:01,721 --> 01:09:04,723
Sport's only following
orders. So am I.

748
01:09:04,808 --> 01:09:06,975
They thought
you might come here.

749
01:09:07,977 --> 01:09:09,228
I don't get it.

750
01:09:10,104 --> 01:09:11,814
Talk to your
pal Gilbert.

751
01:09:11,898 --> 01:09:13,232
About what?

752
01:09:13,817 --> 01:09:15,651
You gotta talk
to Gilbert Catena.

753
01:09:28,414 --> 01:09:31,083
Come on. Come on, get out
of here! Beat it! Scram!

754
01:09:33,044 --> 01:09:34,753
The welcome mat
was not out.

755
01:09:34,838 --> 01:09:37,589
I kept hearing your name.
Now, I'm going to ask you once.

756
01:09:38,591 --> 01:09:39,925
And I just did.

757
01:10:03,074 --> 01:10:04,533
Anybody see him come in?

758
01:10:04,617 --> 01:10:05,826
I don't think so.

759
01:10:16,004 --> 01:10:17,754
You want to know
if we're armed?

760
01:10:18,882 --> 01:10:20,132
We're armed.

761
01:10:23,303 --> 01:10:24,511
Calm down.

762
01:10:26,806 --> 01:10:28,348
Calm down. Calm down.

763
01:10:30,435 --> 01:10:31,768
Hey, back to work.

764
01:10:34,606 --> 01:10:35,814
What's the deal, Phil?

765
01:10:35,899 --> 01:10:37,900
Look around.
What do you see?

766
01:10:39,152 --> 01:10:40,235
A whole bunch
of telephones.

767
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:41,361
You see money.

768
01:10:42,238 --> 01:10:44,323
Last month, there were
independent wire services

769
01:10:44,407 --> 01:10:48,076
letting bookies know who won the
third race at Sportsman's Park,

770
01:10:48,161 --> 01:10:52,497
300 of them nationwide.
Now there's only one, ours.

771
01:10:53,249 --> 01:10:56,084
On October 23rd, you robbed a
bank in Greencastle, Indiana.

772
01:10:56,169 --> 01:10:59,046
You got away
with $74,802.

773
01:10:59,130 --> 01:11:01,089
You thought that
was a big score.

774
01:11:01,174 --> 01:11:03,133
These phones
make that every day.

775
01:11:03,676 --> 01:11:06,762
And it keeps getting made,
day after day after day,

776
01:11:06,846 --> 01:11:10,265
a river of money, and
it gets deeper and wider,

777
01:11:10,350 --> 01:11:14,645
week in and week out, month in
and month out, flowing right to us.

778
01:11:18,858 --> 01:11:20,817
Unless the cops
come through that door.

779
01:11:20,902 --> 01:11:22,861
Which you pay them
not to do.

780
01:11:23,279 --> 01:11:24,404
Right.

781
01:11:25,698 --> 01:11:27,741
Unless you're around.

782
01:11:27,825 --> 01:11:30,661
Then they gotta come through
that door no matter what.

783
01:11:30,745 --> 01:11:32,079
What does that tell you?

784
01:11:32,163 --> 01:11:33,413
I'm popular.

785
01:11:34,332 --> 01:11:36,625
It tells us you're
bad for business.

786
01:11:37,710 --> 01:11:39,795
So the Syndicate's
got a new policy.

787
01:11:40,505 --> 01:11:44,508
All the guys like you,
Karpis, Nelson, Campbell,

788
01:11:45,969 --> 01:11:48,428
we ain't laundering your
money or bonds no more.

789
01:11:48,513 --> 01:11:50,806
You ain't holing up in
our whorehouses anymore.

790
01:11:50,890 --> 01:11:56,228
No armorers, no doctors, no safe
havens, no nothing. You get it?

791
01:12:02,610 --> 01:12:05,237
Personally, you need
something to tide you over?

792
01:12:11,327 --> 01:12:12,661
Good luck to you.

793
01:12:16,124 --> 01:12:19,501
Hamilton has a 34-year-old
sister in Detroit. Arrest her.

794
01:12:19,585 --> 01:12:23,880
Pick up all known Dillinger
associates, doctors, family,

795
01:12:23,965 --> 01:12:26,008
Pierpont's mother
in Indianapolis,

796
01:12:26,092 --> 01:12:28,010
Dillinger's family
in Mooresville.

797
01:12:28,094 --> 01:12:30,262
We suspect them
of harboring.

798
01:12:30,388 --> 01:12:33,432
But Hamilton's family has not
had word from Red in years.

799
01:12:33,933 --> 01:12:36,268
You convince them
to get word.

800
01:12:36,769 --> 01:12:38,854
Create informants,
Agent Purvis.

801
01:12:38,938 --> 01:12:41,773
The suspects are to be
interrogated vigorously, grilled,

802
01:12:41,858 --> 01:12:44,234
no obsolete notions
of sentimentality.

803
01:12:44,318 --> 01:12:46,361
We are in the modern age.
We are making history.

804
01:12:46,446 --> 01:12:48,697
Take direct,
expedient action.

805
01:12:48,781 --> 01:12:51,867
As they say in Italy these days,
"Take off the white gloves!"

806
01:12:52,452 --> 01:12:54,745
Do we understand each
other, Agent Purvis?

807
01:13:01,085 --> 01:13:03,628
These are fine young men
here. What's your name, son?

808
01:13:03,713 --> 01:13:04,796
Harris.

809
01:13:06,466 --> 01:13:09,217
G- men all over the country
have picked up the gauntlet

810
01:13:09,302 --> 01:13:11,928
flung down by the outlaws
and the wanton murderers.

811
01:13:12,013 --> 01:13:13,346
And these junior
crime fighters here,

812
01:13:13,431 --> 01:13:16,058
these Junior G-men, has,
every one of them,

813
01:13:16,142 --> 01:13:17,976
stopped some crime
from occurring

814
01:13:18,061 --> 01:13:21,104
and forestalled an entry into
the black book of criminal deeds.

815
01:13:21,522 --> 01:13:23,940
Today, I am rewarding them
with these medals.

816
01:13:24,025 --> 01:13:26,735
My friend Harris here is
the first. Well done, son.

817
01:13:26,819 --> 01:13:29,237
You can size up a score like
nobody's business, Tommy.

818
01:13:29,322 --> 01:13:30,614
You're a good egg.

819
01:13:31,824 --> 01:13:34,076
But I don't like
Baby Face Nelson.

820
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:37,829
You got Nelson all wrong, John.
He thinks the world of you.

821
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:41,625
Hell, the whole country
thinks you're a goddamn hero.

822
01:13:43,127 --> 01:13:44,419
Where's the bank?

823
01:13:44,504 --> 01:13:45,921
Sioux Falls.

824
01:13:46,005 --> 01:13:48,757
Nelson says there's
$800,000 in there.

825
01:13:49,217 --> 01:13:51,176
Says he's got us a sweet
little place to hole up

826
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:53,595
till after the heat
blows over.

827
01:13:53,679 --> 01:13:55,055
What's he here for?

828
01:13:56,682 --> 01:14:01,269
John, we gotta all be friends, all
right, or this ain't gonna work.

829
01:14:01,354 --> 01:14:05,607
Red told you, after the bank,
we bust out Pierpont and Makley.

830
01:14:05,691 --> 01:14:07,609
It'll take a lot
of careful planning.

831
01:14:08,277 --> 01:14:09,444
Yeah. So?

832
01:14:09,529 --> 01:14:12,864
...and Public Enemy
Number One, John Dillinger.

833
01:14:15,451 --> 01:14:17,202
They may be sitting
amongst you.

834
01:14:20,373 --> 01:14:22,249
They may be in your row.

835
01:14:31,676 --> 01:14:33,093
Turn to your right.

836
01:14:36,556 --> 01:14:38,223
And turn to your left.

837
01:14:39,725 --> 01:14:43,812
If you see them, call the Bureau of
Investigation or your local police.

838
01:14:57,160 --> 01:14:58,368
After the bank,

839
01:14:58,452 --> 01:15:01,663
we'll figure out if we
can bust them out. Okay?

840
01:15:06,878 --> 01:15:08,044
Okay.

841
01:15:21,017 --> 01:15:23,268
"You don't work with
people you don't know

842
01:15:23,352 --> 01:15:24,644
"and you don't work
when you're desperate. "

843
01:15:24,729 --> 01:15:26,813
Walter Dietrich.
Remember that?

844
01:15:27,106 --> 01:15:28,607
Walter forgot.

845
01:15:29,525 --> 01:15:32,194
When you're desperate,
that's when you got no choice.

846
01:15:48,294 --> 01:15:49,711
I got one!

847
01:15:58,888 --> 01:16:01,723
What are you doing? Get your
hands up! Get your hands up!

848
01:16:07,939 --> 01:16:09,731
Come on, sugar,
let's go. Come on.

849
01:16:11,442 --> 01:16:13,443
Where's all the damn money
we came here for?

850
01:16:21,410 --> 01:16:22,410
Come on.

851
01:16:22,745 --> 01:16:24,371
Open the door. What
are you looking at, huh?

852
01:16:25,998 --> 01:16:27,499
What are you looking at?

853
01:16:51,190 --> 01:16:52,357
Tommy.

854
01:17:13,879 --> 01:17:15,338
John, let's go!

855
01:17:20,928 --> 01:17:23,847
Let's go!
Get in the goddamn car!

856
01:17:25,516 --> 01:17:27,475
Let's go!
Let's go! Let's go!

857
01:18:38,214 --> 01:18:39,547
How'd you find
this place?

858
01:18:39,632 --> 01:18:42,175
Don't worry. Nobody
will find us. Come on.

859
01:18:51,977 --> 01:18:53,228
How much?

860
01:18:53,813 --> 01:18:56,231
$46, 120.

861
01:18:58,651 --> 01:19:01,569
That'd be less than
$800,000. Am I right?

862
01:19:04,281 --> 01:19:05,490
Am I right?

863
01:19:06,158 --> 01:19:07,534
It's $8,000 a man.

864
01:19:12,665 --> 01:19:14,249
Leave me
my share and get out.

865
01:19:35,771 --> 01:19:38,022
We gotta cut loose
from Nelson.

866
01:19:38,107 --> 01:19:39,732
You gotta
rest up a while.

867
01:19:40,317 --> 01:19:41,568
No.

868
01:19:42,862 --> 01:19:45,738
No. If we don't get out of
here first thing in the morning,

869
01:19:46,532 --> 01:19:47,532
we're gonna wind up dead.

870
01:19:47,616 --> 01:19:49,200
Only you're
gonna make it.

871
01:19:52,538 --> 01:19:54,998
God damn it, don't talk like that, Red.

872
01:19:55,082 --> 01:19:58,042
No, Johnny. I got a
feeling that my time is up.

873
01:19:58,961 --> 01:20:01,212
And when your time is up,
your time's up.

874
01:20:05,509 --> 01:20:06,718
Red,

875
01:20:08,220 --> 01:20:09,220
look here.

876
01:20:10,556 --> 01:20:15,351
Tomorrow morning, Homer,
you and me will go to Reno,

877
01:20:16,395 --> 01:20:17,770
and everything
will be fine.

878
01:20:37,708 --> 01:20:38,666
Give me a shot.

879
01:20:38,751 --> 01:20:40,752
I'll give you the shot if you
tell me where the gang's holed up.

880
01:20:40,836 --> 01:20:42,378
I don't know anything.
Where's Baby Face Nelson?

881
01:20:42,463 --> 01:20:43,588
I don't know!
Where's Dillinger?

882
01:20:43,631 --> 01:20:44,714
I wanna know where
they are. I don't know!

883
01:20:44,798 --> 01:20:46,132
Tell me!
Where are they?

884
01:20:46,926 --> 01:20:48,468
The bullet entered
the back of his head.

885
01:20:48,552 --> 01:20:50,011
It's resting
over his right eye.

886
01:20:50,095 --> 01:20:51,137
Do not interfere.

887
01:20:51,263 --> 01:20:53,097
Do not interfere. His brain is
swelling! He will be dead soon!

888
01:20:53,182 --> 01:20:55,099
He's suffering and I
need to sedate him!

889
01:20:55,184 --> 01:20:56,309
Not yet.

890
01:20:56,393 --> 01:20:58,228
If you interfere,
I will arrest you.

891
01:20:58,312 --> 01:21:02,315
I don't know! Please, give
me a shot! Oh, mother, please!

892
01:21:02,399 --> 01:21:04,192
Tell me where he is!
I don't know!

893
01:21:04,276 --> 01:21:05,360
All right.

894
01:21:07,154 --> 01:21:08,238
Where?

895
01:21:11,742 --> 01:21:12,742
Tell me!

896
01:21:14,411 --> 01:21:16,162
Little Bohemia.
Little Bohemia.

897
01:21:16,247 --> 01:21:17,830
Manitowish, Wisconsin.

898
01:21:18,457 --> 01:21:19,791
Fuck you!

899
01:21:23,504 --> 01:21:24,879
Give me a shot.

900
01:21:38,686 --> 01:21:42,021
Little Bohemia is in
Manitowish, Wisconsin.

901
01:21:42,398 --> 01:21:43,898
Sam, you drive up.

902
01:23:07,524 --> 01:23:12,320
Madala and Clegg, you cut through
the woods. Stay in the trees.

903
01:23:12,404 --> 01:23:13,738
Come up on it
from the south,

904
01:23:13,822 --> 01:23:16,824
close enough to see if
they're in the barroom there.

905
01:23:16,909 --> 01:23:18,910
Rice, Rorer,

906
01:23:21,413 --> 01:23:24,248
come up on it from the
north. The kitchen is there.

907
01:23:25,084 --> 01:23:28,127
You see if they're in what is probably
the dining room. You stay in the trees.

908
01:23:28,253 --> 01:23:30,171
And if he sees them in there? We go in.

909
01:23:30,255 --> 01:23:31,589
And if he doesn't?

910
01:23:34,259 --> 01:23:35,593
We go in anyway.

911
01:23:37,471 --> 01:23:39,305
There's too much
real estate out here.

912
01:23:39,390 --> 01:23:40,640
Too many ways for him
to get out,

913
01:23:40,724 --> 01:23:43,017
too few of us
to block him in.

914
01:23:43,102 --> 01:23:44,977
We need to blockade
the roads behind us.

915
01:23:45,062 --> 01:23:47,814
We need to wait for Cowley's
group to surround him.

916
01:23:47,898 --> 01:23:50,108
Mr. Purvis, this is
not the way to do it.

917
01:23:53,278 --> 01:23:55,613
I will not risk their
escaping the Bureau again.

918
01:23:57,533 --> 01:24:00,201
You and Hurt take the northeast
corner where the road turns.

919
01:24:00,285 --> 01:24:04,497
Cover that and the front.
Campbell, Baum, you're with me.

920
01:24:11,171 --> 01:24:12,213
Thanks,
but we gotta go.

921
01:24:12,297 --> 01:24:13,881
No, come on, stick
around. Let's have a party.

922
01:24:13,966 --> 01:24:16,008
We gotta work tomorrow.
Aw, work's for mugs.

923
01:24:16,093 --> 01:24:17,301
Get out of here!

924
01:24:29,648 --> 01:24:31,065
You wanna see
my James Cagney?

925
01:24:31,150 --> 01:24:33,568
You wanna see my James
Cagney act? Huh? Huh?

926
01:24:33,652 --> 01:24:36,070
What do you see? What do
you say? What do you know?

927
01:24:36,155 --> 01:24:39,323
What's your name, doll?
This your wife, you dumb egg?

928
01:24:51,420 --> 01:24:52,670
Go ahead.

929
01:25:10,189 --> 01:25:11,397
Stop that car!

930
01:25:12,483 --> 01:25:13,983
Bureau of Investigation!

931
01:25:16,028 --> 01:25:17,111
Stop that car!

932
01:25:19,865 --> 01:25:21,032
Fire!

933
01:26:15,504 --> 01:26:17,713
Don't shoot!
Get on the floor!

934
01:26:28,308 --> 01:26:29,433
Johnny!

935
01:27:19,234 --> 01:27:20,401
Go!

936
01:28:00,275 --> 01:28:01,692
Someone got out!

937
01:28:03,403 --> 01:28:04,862
Is it Dillinger?

938
01:28:04,988 --> 01:28:06,447
I think so!

939
01:28:07,908 --> 01:28:10,868
Baum, you drive around
the woods. You flank him!

940
01:29:43,045 --> 01:29:44,086
Go.

941
01:29:45,922 --> 01:29:47,089
Go!

942
01:30:00,520 --> 01:30:03,272
Come on, Red, come on. Come
on. We're getting out of here.

943
01:30:13,867 --> 01:30:16,869
Hey, give me the keys
to that car.

944
01:30:42,979 --> 01:30:43,979
Have you...

945
01:30:48,193 --> 01:30:49,819
All you bastards
wear vests,

946
01:30:49,903 --> 01:30:52,988
so I'm gonna give it to you high
and I'm gonna give it to you low.

947
01:31:09,005 --> 01:31:10,214
Carter?

948
01:31:15,595 --> 01:31:17,638
Who was it? Dillinger?

949
01:31:17,722 --> 01:31:19,390
Nelson.

950
01:31:40,912 --> 01:31:43,247
Sir, there's somebody
on the road.

951
01:31:45,083 --> 01:31:46,667
PURVIS: Cowley!
Did you see a car?

952
01:31:46,751 --> 01:31:48,169
A Ford, yeah,
it's going the other way.

953
01:31:48,253 --> 01:31:51,130
Turn it around! Madala,
get in. It's Nelson!

954
01:32:06,938 --> 01:32:09,315
Get in, you dumb bastards!
Get in!

955
01:32:11,318 --> 01:32:13,569
Get in. Come on.
Let's go. Come on.

956
01:32:14,112 --> 01:32:15,362
Where'd
you get the car?

957
01:32:15,447 --> 01:32:16,655
I killed a Fed
by the road.

958
01:32:21,244 --> 01:32:22,620
Faster, Sam!

959
01:32:34,507 --> 01:32:36,508
They're behind us.
Let them have it, Homer!

960
01:32:41,723 --> 01:32:43,557
Steady the car,
God damn it!

961
01:32:53,818 --> 01:32:54,944
Shit!

962
01:33:12,671 --> 01:33:14,505
Homer! Homer!

963
01:33:30,146 --> 01:33:31,355
Come on!

964
01:34:13,315 --> 01:34:14,815
Have you never seen
a man die before?

965
01:34:14,899 --> 01:34:16,066
Hush up.

966
01:34:18,611 --> 01:34:20,237
You gotta let go, John.

967
01:34:21,489 --> 01:34:22,614
Bullshit.

968
01:34:26,745 --> 01:34:28,662
And you gotta
let Billie go, too.

969
01:34:34,419 --> 01:34:35,794
I know you.

970
01:34:37,589 --> 01:34:39,298
You've never let
nobody down.

971
01:34:40,759 --> 01:34:42,217
But this time,

972
01:34:43,303 --> 01:34:44,720
you gotta go on.

973
01:34:46,973 --> 01:34:48,390
You gotta let go.

974
01:35:22,884 --> 01:35:24,301
Right now,

975
01:35:25,970 --> 01:35:27,888
all of Dillinger's
friends are dead.

976
01:35:30,975 --> 01:35:32,226
He is out there.

977
01:35:34,104 --> 01:35:35,479
He is alone.

978
01:35:37,524 --> 01:35:41,443
And there will not be a
better chance to run him down.

979
01:35:42,570 --> 01:35:44,238
Yeah, but he could
be anywhere.

980
01:35:44,322 --> 01:35:46,073
He could be anywhere.

981
01:35:46,157 --> 01:35:49,159
But he is not anywhere, because
what he wants is right here.

982
01:36:12,517 --> 01:36:14,601
I don't believe
in the government,

983
01:36:14,686 --> 01:36:16,937
and I don't believe in the
government spending all its money,

984
01:36:17,021 --> 01:36:19,857
and hence I don't
take any part of it.

985
01:36:20,650 --> 01:36:23,318
And you say no, you...

986
01:36:40,128 --> 01:36:42,963
I ought to refuse to accept the
money. It's government money.

987
01:36:43,047 --> 01:36:45,591
I don't believe in
the government spending.

988
01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:48,051
I'm not gonna take it.

989
01:36:51,514 --> 01:36:52,890
What's she doing?

990
01:36:53,600 --> 01:36:55,392
Still listening
to the radio.

991
01:37:52,408 --> 01:37:55,202
Sir, we have questioned
a source, John Probasco.

992
01:37:55,286 --> 01:37:58,455
We have information that leads
us to believe that they're...

993
01:38:25,567 --> 01:38:28,110
But Dillinger did aid
law enforcement in one way.

994
01:38:29,070 --> 01:38:32,990
He's cited as the reason Congress is
considering the first national crime bill,

995
01:38:33,074 --> 01:38:36,660
making criminal enterprise across
state lines a federal offense.

996
01:38:36,744 --> 01:38:37,911
Meanwhile, in Fargo,
North Dakota...

997
01:38:37,996 --> 01:38:39,705
We're building
coast-to-coast.

998
01:38:39,789 --> 01:38:42,291
We want it nice and quiet,
and they bring this on us?

999
01:38:42,834 --> 01:38:45,836
Frank, calm down. They rob banks. Right.

1000
01:38:46,170 --> 01:38:49,756
In one state, then another
state, that's called interstate.

1001
01:38:49,841 --> 01:38:52,217
We're coast to coast.
Wake up!

1002
01:38:52,302 --> 01:38:53,969
Now they can use
these laws on us.

1003
01:39:13,656 --> 01:39:15,073
BILLIE: What time is it?

1004
01:39:16,618 --> 01:39:19,536
It's 4:00 a. m., Sunday
morning. What's wrong?

1005
01:39:20,872 --> 01:39:22,331
I don't want to sleep.

1006
01:39:22,415 --> 01:39:23,540
Why?

1007
01:39:25,084 --> 01:39:27,085
Because I want
all the time we got.

1008
01:39:39,057 --> 01:39:40,390
What if

1009
01:39:41,267 --> 01:39:43,935
we could get out
of here altogether?

1010
01:39:47,231 --> 01:39:48,398
Where?

1011
01:39:50,652 --> 01:39:51,818
Like Cuba?

1012
01:39:52,737 --> 01:39:53,779
Maybe further.

1013
01:39:56,032 --> 01:39:59,785
Alvin's got this job. It's
a big job, a lot of dough.

1014
01:40:02,622 --> 01:40:04,081
We could go away on it.

1015
01:40:04,957 --> 01:40:07,376
We grab a Pan Am
Clipper to Caracas,

1016
01:40:08,252 --> 01:40:11,046
scoot on over to Rio
for some fun in the sun,

1017
01:40:13,633 --> 01:40:14,925
slide off the map.

1018
01:40:18,763 --> 01:40:20,138
We could go dancing

1019
01:40:21,140 --> 01:40:22,724
and have
a lot of laughs

1020
01:40:24,227 --> 01:40:25,560
any time we want.

1021
01:40:31,484 --> 01:40:33,276
Want to take
that ride with me?

1022
01:40:38,616 --> 01:40:40,909
Yeah, I want to take
that ride with you.

1023
01:41:06,394 --> 01:41:07,769
BILLIE: Where's
the apartment?

1024
01:41:07,854 --> 01:41:09,104
Oakley and Potomac.

1025
01:41:09,188 --> 01:41:11,690
All right, the bartender's
name is Larry Strong.

1026
01:41:12,066 --> 01:41:13,567
He'll give you the keys.

1027
01:41:46,100 --> 01:41:48,226
Who brought you?
How did you get here?

1028
01:41:50,188 --> 01:41:52,522
A taxi. I took a taxi.

1029
01:42:16,380 --> 01:42:18,590
Let's go. Let's go, guys.
Come on! Get her outside.

1030
01:43:38,129 --> 01:43:39,296
Where is he?

1031
01:43:40,298 --> 01:43:42,299
Where were you meeting?
Where were you hiding out?

1032
01:43:42,383 --> 01:43:45,635
REINECKE: Answer him or they'll drop
you in a black hole in Cook County.

1033
01:43:52,518 --> 01:43:53,810
Where is he?

1034
01:43:55,187 --> 01:43:56,938
I have to go
to the bathroom.

1035
01:44:33,351 --> 01:44:35,143
Christ, look what you did.

1036
01:44:38,189 --> 01:44:40,148
Where were you
supposed to meet him?

1037
01:44:44,320 --> 01:44:45,612
I can't hear you.

1038
01:44:46,238 --> 01:44:48,448
I can't hear you!

1039
01:44:59,919 --> 01:45:02,379
We were supposed to
meet at our apartment.

1040
01:45:03,673 --> 01:45:04,839
Where?

1041
01:45:05,716 --> 01:45:07,092
On Addison.

1042
01:45:07,551 --> 01:45:08,802
What number?

1043
01:45:11,180 --> 01:45:13,014
1148.

1044
01:45:13,099 --> 01:45:14,557
When?

1045
01:45:17,895 --> 01:45:19,145
Right now.

1046
01:45:26,404 --> 01:45:28,905
Miss Roberts, can you
reach Agent Purvis?

1047
01:45:28,990 --> 01:45:31,658
No. He's on his way back
from Mooresville, Indiana.

1048
01:45:31,742 --> 01:45:33,618
He's going directly
to Cook County Jail.

1049
01:45:36,872 --> 01:45:39,833
John Dillinger's holed up
at 1148 Addison.

1050
01:46:15,786 --> 01:46:16,953
Where is he?

1051
01:46:20,750 --> 01:46:21,791
Well,

1052
01:46:24,712 --> 01:46:27,797
way the hell away from
here by now, isn't he?

1053
01:46:29,550 --> 01:46:33,136
You wanted to know where
he is, you dumb flatfoot.

1054
01:46:35,848 --> 01:46:39,309
Mr. Purvis, those men cannot
treat a woman in this way.

1055
01:46:42,271 --> 01:46:44,981
You walked right past him
on State Street.

1056
01:46:46,025 --> 01:46:48,318
You were too scared
to look around.

1057
01:46:49,028 --> 01:46:51,362
He was at the curb
in that black Buick.

1058
01:46:52,573 --> 01:46:55,241
You asked me how I got there,
I told you I took a taxi,

1059
01:46:55,326 --> 01:46:57,494
and you believed me?

1060
01:46:58,496 --> 01:47:01,414
He dropped me off
and was waiting for me.

1061
01:47:01,999 --> 01:47:04,918
And you walked
right past him.

1062
01:47:13,803 --> 01:47:18,515
And when my Johnny finds out
how you slapped around his girl,

1063
01:47:19,850 --> 01:47:23,103
you know what happens
to you, fat boy?

1064
01:47:31,654 --> 01:47:32,862
Uncuff her.

1065
01:47:46,877 --> 01:47:48,878
Restroom is
down the hall.

1066
01:47:56,053 --> 01:47:57,470
I can't stand up.

1067
01:48:17,324 --> 01:48:18,491
Miss Rogers.

1068
01:48:35,342 --> 01:48:36,342
Hello.

1069
01:48:36,927 --> 01:48:40,430
I'm Marty Zarkovich. I was
told to call you, Mr. Nitti.

1070
01:48:41,473 --> 01:48:43,433
I think I can get her
to play ball.

1071
01:48:44,935 --> 01:48:46,102
Make sure.

1072
01:48:49,148 --> 01:48:50,356
Yes, sir, Mr. Nitti.

1073
01:48:59,992 --> 01:49:01,451
What did they say, Anna?

1074
01:49:04,455 --> 01:49:07,081
They say they send me
back to Romania.

1075
01:49:08,500 --> 01:49:09,792
You know what to do.

1076
01:49:16,800 --> 01:49:19,469
Can they fix deportation?
Can they do that?

1077
01:49:20,971 --> 01:49:22,722
These guys
can fix anything.

1078
01:49:32,775 --> 01:49:33,858
Okay.

1079
01:50:00,010 --> 01:50:01,261
I want guarantee.

1080
01:50:03,681 --> 01:50:06,766
If you aid us in
apprehending John Dillinger,

1081
01:50:07,393 --> 01:50:08,935
I give you my word

1082
01:50:09,561 --> 01:50:12,230
I will do everything I can to
influence Bureau of Immigration

1083
01:50:12,314 --> 01:50:13,773
to let you stay
in America.

1084
01:50:13,857 --> 01:50:14,983
Not enough.

1085
01:50:16,360 --> 01:50:17,819
Well, that's all there is.

1086
01:50:18,696 --> 01:50:20,154
I want guarantee.

1087
01:50:21,573 --> 01:50:23,366
Well, you're not
gonna get one.

1088
01:50:25,035 --> 01:50:26,536
I think you did this.

1089
01:50:26,620 --> 01:50:30,039
I think you told Immigration to pick
me up and send me back to Romania.

1090
01:50:32,418 --> 01:50:34,210
How do you
socialize with him?

1091
01:50:38,132 --> 01:50:39,299
We go out.

1092
01:50:41,760 --> 01:50:44,512
Maybe tomorrow night.
Maybe not.

1093
01:50:45,681 --> 01:50:48,891
Maybe in a week, a month.
Maybe never.

1094
01:50:51,979 --> 01:50:54,731
I will not guarantee
what Immigration will do,

1095
01:50:54,815 --> 01:50:56,983
but I can guarantee
what I will do.

1096
01:50:57,067 --> 01:50:59,444
If you do not cooperate,

1097
01:51:00,779 --> 01:51:04,115
you will be on a boat out
of this country in 48 hours.

1098
01:51:04,742 --> 01:51:06,576
Do not play games
with me.

1099
01:51:13,917 --> 01:51:15,084
Who is "we"?

1100
01:51:16,420 --> 01:51:19,714
Me, him, Polly Hamilton,
one of my girls.

1101
01:51:22,051 --> 01:51:23,676
How will we know?

1102
01:51:25,262 --> 01:51:27,263
I call you on the day
when I know.

1103
01:51:53,040 --> 01:51:54,040
Did you get in there?
Did you see her?

1104
01:51:54,124 --> 01:51:55,500
Yes, I did.

1105
01:51:56,794 --> 01:51:58,252
She palmed me
this note.

1106
01:52:14,269 --> 01:52:15,812
PIQUETT: She told me
what it said.

1107
01:52:16,897 --> 01:52:18,147
That's good advice.

1108
01:52:21,735 --> 01:52:23,319
What are you doing here?

1109
01:52:26,407 --> 01:52:27,740
Meeting people.

1110
01:52:43,340 --> 01:52:46,426
On Tuesday, it'll carry the payrolls
for seven factories around Rockford.

1111
01:52:46,510 --> 01:52:48,344
There's two ways in,
two ways out.

1112
01:52:48,429 --> 01:52:51,222
Doc cuts the telephone lines
five minutes before.

1113
01:52:51,306 --> 01:52:53,599
Train arrives,
you and I go in strong.

1114
01:52:53,684 --> 01:52:55,435
Harry handles the door
and the safe.

1115
01:52:55,519 --> 01:52:57,019
Jimmy and Freddy drive.

1116
01:53:00,023 --> 01:53:01,107
What do you figure?

1117
01:53:01,191 --> 01:53:04,652
About $1,500,000
to $1,700,000.

1118
01:53:05,320 --> 01:53:07,280
$300,000 each.

1119
01:53:07,364 --> 01:53:08,865
Holy cow.
Yeah.

1120
01:53:10,868 --> 01:53:13,369
We pull this Tuesday,
I'm gone Wednesday.

1121
01:53:13,454 --> 01:53:14,954
Yeah. Where? Cuba?

1122
01:53:15,456 --> 01:53:16,581
No.

1123
01:53:17,499 --> 01:53:20,376
No. Where I go, I'm gonna have
to go a lot farther than Cuba.

1124
01:53:21,920 --> 01:53:23,171
Yeah.

1125
01:53:33,474 --> 01:53:34,474
Hi, Jimmy.

1126
01:53:34,558 --> 01:53:35,600
What do you say?

1127
01:53:35,684 --> 01:53:37,143
Polly, Jimmy's back!

1128
01:53:54,286 --> 01:53:55,620
I tell you what, doll.

1129
01:53:56,538 --> 01:53:59,373
How about you, Polly and me
go out to a movie tonight?

1130
01:53:59,458 --> 01:54:00,958
Get in some refrigeration.

1131
01:54:01,627 --> 01:54:03,085
Where do you
want to go?

1132
01:54:03,587 --> 01:54:05,755
Maybe the Marbro
or the Biograph.

1133
01:54:07,591 --> 01:54:09,467
Jimmy's taking us
to the picture show.

1134
01:54:09,551 --> 01:54:10,593
Mmm.

1135
01:54:10,677 --> 01:54:13,054
I'll go to the store later and
make fried chicken for dinner.

1136
01:54:13,138 --> 01:54:14,430
Where you going?

1137
01:54:14,556 --> 01:54:15,806
Streetcar.

1138
01:54:16,266 --> 01:54:18,768
I gotta go downtown to get
my waitressing license.

1139
01:54:19,978 --> 01:54:23,731
Hang on a minute. I'll take
you. It's too damn hot in here.

1140
01:54:24,316 --> 01:54:25,316
Yeah?

1141
01:54:41,583 --> 01:54:44,001
Mr. Purvis. Anna Sage.

1142
01:54:46,505 --> 01:54:48,005
Afternoon, Miss Sage.

1143
01:54:56,098 --> 01:54:57,265
It is tonight!

1144
01:54:57,808 --> 01:54:59,600
Anna Sage will be with him

1145
01:54:59,685 --> 01:55:02,853
and will wear a white blouse
over an orange skirt.

1146
01:55:02,938 --> 01:55:04,855
PURVIS: That is how
we will know it is him.

1147
01:55:05,732 --> 01:55:07,692
He may have changed
his appearance.

1148
01:55:07,776 --> 01:55:10,570
And we have not learned if he will
go to the Marbro or the Biograph.

1149
01:55:10,654 --> 01:55:12,655
Two theaters?
That's right.

1150
01:55:12,739 --> 01:55:13,990
What's playing?

1151
01:55:14,074 --> 01:55:15,283
Excuse me?

1152
01:55:15,367 --> 01:55:18,077
What's playing at the Marbro?
What's playing at the Biograph?

1153
01:55:21,498 --> 01:55:25,293
A Shirley Temple movie called
Little Miss Marker is at the Marbro.

1154
01:55:25,377 --> 01:55:27,628
The Biograph is playing
a gangster picture

1155
01:55:27,713 --> 01:55:30,756
starring Clark Gable,
Manhattan Melodrama.

1156
01:55:31,174 --> 01:55:34,010
John Dillinger ain't going
to a Shirley Temple movie.

1157
01:55:34,553 --> 01:55:37,972
Sergeants Zarkovich and O'Neill, from
the East Chicago Police Department,

1158
01:55:38,056 --> 01:55:41,892
and Agent Winstead will be
at the Biograph, as will I.

1159
01:55:41,977 --> 01:55:44,895
Now, Virgil Peterson, you
will coordinate the Marbro.

1160
01:55:44,980 --> 01:55:48,024
He will be armed and
extremely dangerous.

1161
01:55:52,362 --> 01:55:53,613
Is that it?

1162
01:55:53,697 --> 01:55:54,822
Yep.

1163
01:55:54,906 --> 01:55:56,657
I'll be right back.
Hold on.

1164
01:56:01,872 --> 01:56:03,122
I'll go in with you.

1165
01:56:04,041 --> 01:56:05,333
All right.

1166
01:56:09,004 --> 01:56:10,546
It might take 10 minutes.

1167
01:56:11,548 --> 01:56:12,882
I'll meet you outside.

1168
01:58:11,835 --> 01:58:15,254
I'd like to see Babe take
one more swing this season.

1169
01:58:17,716 --> 01:58:22,178
But his leg is pretty sore. He takes a
bit of batting practice, but not very much.

1170
01:58:26,975 --> 01:58:28,184
What's the score?

1171
01:58:29,352 --> 01:58:31,228
Cubs, 3-2,
top of the 7th.

1172
01:58:31,688 --> 01:58:33,731
...that's why he's
out of today's game.

1173
01:58:33,815 --> 01:58:36,275
The pitch is high.
Ball one.

1174
01:58:36,777 --> 01:58:41,030
Broaca, the batter
leading off for the Yankees,

1175
01:58:41,865 --> 01:58:43,574
did not see
the ball very well.

1176
01:58:45,744 --> 01:58:47,036
What's going on?

1177
01:58:50,540 --> 01:58:51,832
Nothing yet.

1178
01:58:59,216 --> 01:59:01,425
They haven't shown up
at the Marbro.

1179
02:00:36,271 --> 02:00:37,563
Blackie!
Jim!

1180
02:00:37,647 --> 02:00:38,814
Well, you old
son of a gun!

1181
02:00:38,899 --> 02:00:40,733
I say, you're
looking swell, Jim.

1182
02:00:40,817 --> 02:00:42,401
Let's get a load of this
Dempsey-Firpo binge, shall we?

1183
02:00:42,485 --> 02:00:44,945
Yeah, yeah. But when will we get
together again? Gee, it's been weeks!

1184
02:00:45,030 --> 02:00:46,572
Well, what about
tomorrow night? Saturday?

1185
02:00:47,073 --> 02:00:50,200
I will light my cigar
when he's coming out.

1186
02:00:50,869 --> 02:00:54,204
Zarkovich, O'Neill,
you and your men

1187
02:00:54,289 --> 02:00:56,832
take the hat store right
across from the theater.

1188
02:00:57,500 --> 02:01:01,837
Smith, Suran, Clegg, take two
agents, you cover the rear alley.

1189
02:01:02,505 --> 02:01:06,467
And Rorer and Rice, you stay in
the car with Reinecke to the north.

1190
02:01:06,551 --> 02:01:08,427
Clarence and I are
gonna be in the doorway

1191
02:01:08,511 --> 02:01:10,930
30 feet south of
the theater entrance.

1192
02:01:11,014 --> 02:01:14,600
Gerry, you're in the tan sedan
just to the north of the entrance.

1193
02:01:14,684 --> 02:01:16,143
In case he walks north?

1194
02:01:16,227 --> 02:01:18,187
He ain't gonna walk
north, Mr. Purvis.

1195
02:01:18,271 --> 02:01:21,732
He's gonna head south, cut through
the alley back to her place.

1196
02:01:23,735 --> 02:01:25,277
Madala.

1197
02:01:34,996 --> 02:01:36,163
Hello, Gallagher.

1198
02:01:36,247 --> 02:01:37,623
Hello, Snow.

1199
02:01:37,707 --> 02:01:38,832
Must be something
pretty important,

1200
02:01:38,917 --> 02:01:40,751
getting me in here in
the middle of the game.

1201
02:01:40,835 --> 02:01:41,961
What do you want?

1202
02:01:42,045 --> 02:01:44,213
I want to do a little
favor for a friend.

1203
02:02:04,067 --> 02:02:07,528
You're the governor.
You can save his life.

1204
02:02:09,447 --> 02:02:11,991
He's guilty.
The jury says so.

1205
02:02:33,263 --> 02:02:34,596
Goodbye, Blackie.

1206
02:03:01,791 --> 02:03:02,875
Goodbye, Jim.

1207
02:03:02,959 --> 02:03:04,376
I can't help it, Blackie.

1208
02:03:04,461 --> 02:03:06,086
I'm not gonna
let you die.

1209
02:03:06,713 --> 02:03:07,963
I've got to commute you.

1210
02:03:08,548 --> 02:03:10,007
You think you're
doing me a favor

1211
02:03:10,091 --> 02:03:12,801
by keeping me locked up in this
filthy trap for the rest of my life?

1212
02:03:12,886 --> 02:03:16,430
No, thanks. Come on,
warden, let's go.

1213
02:03:41,998 --> 02:03:43,373
So long, Blackie.

1214
02:03:44,125 --> 02:03:46,835
Kid, keep your chin
up and your nose clean.

1215
02:03:50,840 --> 02:03:53,258
Die the way you lived, all of
a sudden, that's the way to go.

1216
02:03:53,343 --> 02:03:55,094
Don't drag it out.

1217
02:03:55,178 --> 02:03:57,304
Living like that
doesn't mean a thing.

1218
02:07:14,377 --> 02:07:15,711
What did he say?

1219
02:07:18,423 --> 02:07:19,881
I couldn't hear him.

1220
02:07:31,894 --> 02:07:35,063
You take care of this. I
need to go call Washington.

1221
02:09:05,196 --> 02:09:06,738
How you doing, Billie?

1222
02:09:11,119 --> 02:09:12,953
I'm Special Agent Winstead.

1223
02:09:17,417 --> 02:09:19,835
If you've come here to ask
me more damn questions...

1224
02:09:20,628 --> 02:09:22,921
"Where's this one
or that one?"

1225
02:09:23,005 --> 02:09:25,424
I didn't come here for
you to tell me something.

1226
02:09:26,426 --> 02:09:28,468
I came here to
tell you something.

1227
02:09:39,063 --> 02:09:41,106
They say you're the man who shot him.

1228
02:09:44,402 --> 02:09:46,903
That's right.
One of them.

1229
02:09:48,406 --> 02:09:50,365
So why are you
coming here to see me?

1230
02:09:52,493 --> 02:09:54,494
To see the damage
you've done?

1231
02:09:57,582 --> 02:09:58,665
No.

1232
02:10:01,544 --> 02:10:03,503
I came here because
he asked me to.

1233
02:10:08,426 --> 02:10:10,302
When he went down,
he said something.

1234
02:10:12,221 --> 02:10:14,055
I put my ear
next to his mouth,

1235
02:10:15,224 --> 02:10:17,142
and what I think
he said was this.

1236
02:10:19,145 --> 02:10:20,395
He said,

1237
02:10:21,189 --> 02:10:23,064
"Tell Billie for me,

1238
02:10:24,525 --> 02:10:26,234
"'Bye-bye, blackbird. "'
