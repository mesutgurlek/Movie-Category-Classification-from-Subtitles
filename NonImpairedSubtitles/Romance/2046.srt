1
00:02:10,287 --> 00:02:14,963
In the year 2046, a vast
rail network spans the globe

2
00:02:16,087 --> 00:02:20,558
A mysterious train leaves
for 2046 every once in a while

3
00:02:21,967 --> 00:02:25,562
Every passenger going to
2046 has the same intention

4
00:02:26,207 --> 00:02:28,675
They want to recapture lost
memories

5
00:02:29,367 --> 00:02:33,485
Because nothing ever changes
in 2046

6
00:02:34,607 --> 00:02:36,563
Nobody really knows if
that's true

7
00:02:36,887 --> 00:02:39,720
Because nobody's ever come back

8
00:02:40,487 --> 00:02:42,318
Except me

9
00:02:45,887 --> 00:02:48,765
998.

10
00:02:51,447 --> 00:02:53,961
997.

11
00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:56,284
I f someone wants to I eave 2046...

12
00:02:58,207 --> 00:03:00,277
...how long will it take?

13
00:03:01,327 --> 00:03:03,283
Some people get away
fairly easily

14
00:03:04,687 --> 00:03:08,123
Others find that it takes
them much longer

15
00:03:09,367 --> 00:03:12,518
I forget how long I've been
on this train

16
00:03:13,767 --> 00:03:16,281
I'm starting to feel very lonely

17
00:03:21,207 --> 00:03:24,643
As I recall
many have gone to 2046

18
00:03:25,367 --> 00:03:27,756
You're the first to come back

19
00:03:29,967 --> 00:03:33,676
May I ask why you left 2046?

20
00:03:39,767 --> 00:03:42,804
Whenever anyone asked
why I left 2046...

21
00:03:43,287 --> 00:03:46,518
...I gave them some vague answer

22
00:03:50,367 --> 00:03:51,846
Before...

23
00:03:52,527 --> 00:03:55,360
...when people had secrets
they didn't want to share

24
00:03:55,727 --> 00:03:57,843
...they'd climb a mountain

25
00:03:58,367 --> 00:04:01,086
They'd find a tree
and carve a hole in it

26
00:04:03,687 --> 00:04:06,121
And whisper the secret into the hole

27
00:04:07,487 --> 00:04:09,762
Then cover it over with mud

28
00:04:12,807 --> 00:04:18,325
That way. nobody else would
ever discover it

29
00:04:20,327 --> 00:04:22,124
I once fell in love with someone

30
00:04:24,287 --> 00:04:26,403
After a while. she wasn't there

31
00:04:28,527 --> 00:04:30,165
I went to 2046

32
00:04:31,607 --> 00:04:35,236
I thought she might be waiting
for me there

33
00:04:37,447 --> 00:04:39,642
But I couldn't find her

34
00:04:43,207 --> 00:04:47,200
I can't stop wondering if
she loved me or not

35
00:04:50,007 --> 00:04:52,999
But I never found out

36
00:04:54,647 --> 00:04:57,480
Maybe her answer was
like a secret...

37
00:04:58,647 --> 00:05:01,844
that no one else would ever know

38
00:05:04,007 --> 00:05:08,398
All memories are traces of tears

39
00:05:25,407 --> 00:05:27,477
Didn't you promise not to
come back?

40
00:05:29,367 --> 00:05:30,561
I came to see you

41
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,316
Why?

42
00:05:37,647 --> 00:05:39,399
I have no prospects here

43
00:05:39,847 --> 00:05:42,884
So I'll see how things are
in Hong Kong

44
00:05:49,047 --> 00:05:50,480
When are you leaving?

45
00:05:52,487 --> 00:05:54,443
The boat sails in two days

46
00:06:02,607 --> 00:06:04,245
Why are you telling me?

47
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:16,284
I thought we might go together

48
00:06:27,607 --> 00:06:29,598
You know nothing about my past
do you?

49
00:06:34,927 --> 00:06:36,838
If you'd rather not tell me
I don't mind

50
00:06:52,847 --> 00:06:54,405
If you win. I'll join you

51
00:07:31,287 --> 00:07:33,357
She found an indirect way
of rejecting me

52
00:07:34,567 --> 00:07:35,682
As I recall...

53
00:07:36,367 --> 00:07:38,198
...that was the very last time
we saw each other

54
00:07:39,247 --> 00:07:41,556
Right after that
I left Singapore

55
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:08,404
I got back to Hong Kong
at the end of 1966

56
00:08:09,247 --> 00:08:10,965
Because of the price raise
of ferry ticket

57
00:08:11,207 --> 00:08:12,401
There was riots in Kowloon

58
00:08:13,847 --> 00:08:15,439
I wasn't sure how long
I'd be staying...

59
00:08:16,087 --> 00:08:18,362
So I took a room in a small
hotel in Wanchai

60
00:08:18,567 --> 00:08:20,319
I wrote columns for the Newspapers

61
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:23,758
They paid HK$10 per thousand words

62
00:08:24,807 --> 00:08:26,877
I t was pretty tough at first

63
00:08:42,447 --> 00:08:43,675
As long as I could make ends meet

64
00:08:44,247 --> 00:08:47,683
...it made no difference what
kind of stuff I wrote

65
00:08:48,367 --> 00:08:49,595
"Diary of the Bazooka Hero"

66
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:52,641
"The new star at
Club Luk Kwok is Fei Fei!"

67
00:08:53,287 --> 00:08:55,278
"A knockout beauty with
amazing bazookas!"

68
00:08:56,167 --> 00:08:57,725
"A smash hit with tit-lovers!"

69
00:08:59,207 --> 00:09:01,596
Hang on. of course I exaggerate

70
00:09:01,927 --> 00:09:03,599
I can't say her tits are fake
can I?

71
00:09:12,607 --> 00:09:15,075
I soon got used to
this kind of life

72
00:09:15,647 --> 00:09:17,000
I became an expert ladies' man

73
00:09:18,047 --> 00:09:19,924
Lots of one-night-stands

74
00:09:20,527 --> 00:09:23,564
But nothing lasts forever anyway

75
00:09:40,047 --> 00:09:43,881
24 December 1966

76
00:09:50,687 --> 00:09:52,439
Is that really true?

77
00:09:53,567 --> 00:09:55,080
Why would I lie to you?

78
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:57,764
You really know me?

79
00:09:58,647 --> 00:10:00,478
Weren't you in a show in
Singapore in ' 64?

80
00:10:01,647 --> 00:10:02,557
Yes

81
00:10:03,007 --> 00:10:04,360
You' re Lu I u

82
00:10:17,207 --> 00:10:18,276
I was then

83
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,360
Not any more

84
00:10:21,127 --> 00:10:22,480
What's your name now?

85
00:10:25,967 --> 00:10:27,400
Why should I tell you?

86
00:10:29,847 --> 00:10:31,166
On Christmas Eve 1966...

87
00:10:32,047 --> 00:10:35,164
...I ran into a friend from
Singapore in a night club

88
00:10:35,967 --> 00:10:37,320
We'd been rather close

89
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:38,763
But that night...

90
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:40,806
...she'd apparent I y forgotten me

91
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:47,479
Have we really met before?

92
00:10:50,287 --> 00:10:51,845
How could you forget?

93
00:10:53,367 --> 00:10:55,597
You said I looked like
your late boyfriend

94
00:10:55,847 --> 00:10:57,883
You taught me the cha-cha

95
00:11:09,327 --> 00:11:10,646
Go on...

96
00:11:17,367 --> 00:11:19,244
You were always dragging
me to the casino

97
00:11:20,727 --> 00:11:22,080
You'd hit a losing streak

98
00:11:23,047 --> 00:11:24,241
You owed a fortune

99
00:11:25,767 --> 00:11:27,997
My friends and I paid
for your passage to Hong Kong

100
00:11:30,847 --> 00:11:32,997
You talked a lot about
your late boyfriend

101
00:11:34,407 --> 00:11:38,400
A Chinese Filipino from
a rich family

102
00:11:40,087 --> 00:11:41,486
You planned to marry him

103
00:11:42,487 --> 00:11:43,715
But he died young

104
00:11:45,567 --> 00:11:47,398
You said he was the
love of your life

105
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,282
I shouldn't bring
back sad memories...

106
00:11:54,967 --> 00:11:56,286
...at this time of year

107
00:11:58,207 --> 00:11:59,879
But do you remember
that Christmas night...

108
00:12:00,687 --> 00:12:02,245
...we went drinking?

109
00:12:17,007 --> 00:12:18,565
We talked a lot

110
00:12:20,327 --> 00:12:23,046
Was she just pretending
she'd forgotten me?

111
00:12:25,527 --> 00:12:28,166
I took her back to her hotel
She was dead to the world

112
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:49,639
She'd had too much to drink...

113
00:12:50,167 --> 00:12:51,725
...so I left quickly

114
00:13:22,487 --> 00:13:25,638
On my way out. I noticed a
very familiar number

115
00:13:28,567 --> 00:13:32,480
If I hadn't run into her that night
I wouldn't have seen that number

116
00:13:32,967 --> 00:13:35,800
...and I wouldn't have written '2046'

117
00:13:46,767 --> 00:13:48,246
Can I help you?

118
00:13:48,687 --> 00:13:50,200
Is Miss Lulu in?

119
00:13:50,447 --> 00:13:53,519
Lulu? There's no Miss Lulu here

120
00:13:53,887 --> 00:13:55,206
There was a Mimi...

121
00:13:55,567 --> 00:13:56,841
...but she's moved out

122
00:13:58,367 --> 00:14:00,403
But I was here two days ago!

123
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:02,565
Do you know where she's gone?

124
00:14:03,207 --> 00:14:05,596
No! What do you want with her?

125
00:14:06,127 --> 00:14:07,003
Nothing. really

126
00:14:08,687 --> 00:14:10,086
I have her key

127
00:14:10,327 --> 00:14:11,442
I wanted to return it

128
00:14:11,687 --> 00:14:13,120
You can give it to me

129
00:14:13,887 --> 00:14:14,842
Thanks

130
00:14:20,207 --> 00:14:21,435
You want to rent the room?

131
00:14:22,687 --> 00:14:23,676
I'm just back from abroad

132
00:14:24,007 --> 00:14:25,122
I don't have my own place yet

133
00:14:25,567 --> 00:14:27,125
If the room's vacant
I could take a look

134
00:14:27,767 --> 00:14:29,439
This is just a small hotel

135
00:14:30,047 --> 00:14:32,561
But our residents are
all decent people

136
00:14:33,487 --> 00:14:35,079
What's your line of work?

137
00:14:35,367 --> 00:14:36,561
I write for newspapers

138
00:14:36,887 --> 00:14:39,924
Great! A fellow artist!

139
00:14:42,207 --> 00:14:43,560
I haven't always done this

140
00:14:44,127 --> 00:14:46,197
I used to be an artist too

141
00:14:46,767 --> 00:14:47,677
Really?

142
00:14:47,967 --> 00:14:50,276
I took singing lessons
in Harbin

143
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:52,843
Back then. I was a tenor

144
00:14:53,847 --> 00:14:56,315
It'll be a pleasure to
have you here

145
00:14:56,807 --> 00:14:57,956
When will you move in?

146
00:14:58,647 --> 00:14:59,762
As soon as possible

147
00:15:01,727 --> 00:15:03,080
But...

148
00:15:03,327 --> 00:15:05,158
2046 has to be redecorated

149
00:15:05,447 --> 00:15:06,960
2047 is vacant

150
00:15:07,247 --> 00:15:08,566
Take a look at it

151
00:15:16,927 --> 00:15:18,280
Never mind

152
00:15:18,487 --> 00:15:19,886
I'll come back when it's ready

153
00:15:21,367 --> 00:15:22,959
Why that particular room?

154
00:15:24,807 --> 00:15:26,320
Maybe it's the number

155
00:15:27,047 --> 00:15:29,197
It has some significance for you?

156
00:15:29,487 --> 00:15:30,886
I'm joking

157
00:15:31,527 --> 00:15:32,437
Tell you what...

158
00:15:33,127 --> 00:15:34,276
Take a quick look at 2047

159
00:15:34,687 --> 00:15:36,917
If it's okay. you can move in

160
00:15:37,367 --> 00:15:41,758
Then switch to 2046
when it's ready

161
00:15:42,007 --> 00:15:43,838
How about it?

162
00:15:46,167 --> 00:15:47,520
Can I see the room?

163
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:49,765
Of course! Please...

164
00:16:07,487 --> 00:16:08,715
Once I moved in...

165
00:16:09,767 --> 00:16:10,677
...I found out what had
happened the night before

166
00:16:11,487 --> 00:16:13,796
Lulu was stabbed by a
jealous boyfriend

167
00:16:15,967 --> 00:16:17,525
A drummer from the club

168
00:16:18,527 --> 00:16:19,562
She'd really liked him...

169
00:16:21,007 --> 00:16:23,237
...and compared him with a
bird that could never land

170
00:16:24,527 --> 00:16:25,562
For all these years...

171
00:16:26,287 --> 00:16:29,245
She has been looking
for her legless bird'

172
00:16:30,407 --> 00:16:31,840
Most of her affairs ended badly

173
00:16:32,887 --> 00:16:34,366
But she didn't mind sad endings

174
00:16:35,847 --> 00:16:36,723
No matter what happened...

175
00:16:37,727 --> 00:16:39,718
...at least she was
always the leading lady

176
00:17:28,567 --> 00:17:29,886
Good!

177
00:17:30,327 --> 00:17:31,919
Sure!

178
00:17:33,247 --> 00:17:34,646
Go!

179
00:17:36,407 --> 00:17:37,806
Let's go!

180
00:17:39,967 --> 00:17:41,559
Let's go!

181
00:17:42,087 --> 00:17:43,566
I'll go with you!

182
00:17:44,527 --> 00:17:46,119
Good. I'll go with you!

183
00:17:46,727 --> 00:17:48,206
Sure!

184
00:17:50,367 --> 00:17:52,164
I understand!

185
00:17:54,007 --> 00:17:57,682
You know what I mean?
I know... I understand

186
00:17:59,247 --> 00:18:00,919
I got it!

187
00:18:03,967 --> 00:18:06,845
Can I go?

188
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,043
I can go!

189
00:18:10,327 --> 00:18:11,680
Sure!

190
00:18:13,007 --> 00:18:14,679
I understand!

191
00:18:15,367 --> 00:18:17,835
Got it!

192
00:18:23,007 --> 00:18:25,567
It didn't take long to
finish redecorating 2046

193
00:18:27,007 --> 00:18:28,963
But by then I was used to 2047

194
00:18:31,207 --> 00:18:32,162
Sure!

195
00:18:32,447 --> 00:18:34,085
I started hearing a strange
voice through the wall

196
00:18:34,967 --> 00:18:36,446
I thought someone had moved in

197
00:18:37,807 --> 00:18:39,399
But it was the daughter of
the hotel owner. Mr. Wang

198
00:18:43,087 --> 00:18:43,997
Definitely!

199
00:18:45,007 --> 00:18:46,326
I'm definitely going!

200
00:18:48,087 --> 00:18:51,284
Okay. let's go!

201
00:19:09,727 --> 00:19:11,319
I had no idea what she was saying

202
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:17,517
The bell-hop told
me it was Japanese

203
00:19:20,327 --> 00:19:22,761
It seems she had a Japanese boyfriend

204
00:19:24,687 --> 00:19:27,520
Tell the driver "220 Granville Road"

205
00:19:28,287 --> 00:19:29,686
Ga... ran... wai....
220 Granville Road

206
00:19:29,927 --> 00:19:35,320
Turn from Humphreys Avenue
near to Kimberley Road

207
00:19:35,527 --> 00:19:36,596
Can you say again?

208
00:19:36,847 --> 00:19:38,166
Don't turn down Salisbury
Road Slowly. please...

209
00:19:38,527 --> 00:19:39,403
I'll draw you a map

210
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:40,636
That's my pen!

211
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:41,882
I'll repeat it once more

212
00:19:42,167 --> 00:19:43,646
Turn from Humphreys Avenue

213
00:19:43,967 --> 00:19:45,036
Near to Kimberley Road

214
00:19:45,447 --> 00:19:47,438
But don't turn down Salisbury Road

215
00:19:47,807 --> 00:19:48,717
Understand?

216
00:19:49,047 --> 00:19:50,366
I'll draw you a map

217
00:19:51,527 --> 00:19:52,721
Granville Road

218
00:19:53,407 --> 00:19:54,396
Turn from Humphreys Avenue

219
00:19:55,207 --> 00:19:56,606
Don't turn down Salisbury Road

220
00:19:58,767 --> 00:20:00,758
Remember
don't turn down Salisbury Road

221
00:20:10,287 --> 00:20:11,481
His company in Japan had
sent him to Hong Kong

222
00:20:13,527 --> 00:20:15,995
When he got here
he checked into this hotel

223
00:20:18,287 --> 00:20:19,606
The world is full of men!

224
00:20:20,247 --> 00:20:22,397
Why do you have
to choose a Japanese?

225
00:20:22,967 --> 00:20:24,195
Get rid of him!

226
00:20:24,567 --> 00:20:26,603
I will never meet him!

227
00:20:27,247 --> 00:20:28,362
You want my blessing?

228
00:20:29,327 --> 00:20:31,204
Not while I'm alive!

229
00:20:33,967 --> 00:20:35,241
It had been going on for ages

230
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:36,802
Mr. Wang's family suffered
under the Japanese in the war

231
00:20:37,727 --> 00:20:38,796
So they had to break up

232
00:21:16,127 --> 00:21:18,561
Can you tell me what you feel?

233
00:21:24,247 --> 00:21:26,397
Do you like me?

234
00:21:29,367 --> 00:21:30,959
Or not?

235
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:38,157
I'm scared to hear your answer

236
00:21:46,887 --> 00:21:49,037
But I have to ask anyway

237
00:22:11,887 --> 00:22:13,240
Leave with me

238
00:22:54,447 --> 00:22:56,244
Goodbye

239
00:23:15,007 --> 00:23:16,360
The man finally went back to Japan

240
00:23:18,887 --> 00:23:23,278
That's when Miss
Wang began talking to herself

241
00:23:51,527 --> 00:23:53,757
Hey. ask your boss to turn it a bit!

242
00:23:54,967 --> 00:23:57,845
Mr. Chow
you'd better ask him yourself

243
00:24:00,927 --> 00:24:02,076
Mr. Chow....

244
00:24:03,007 --> 00:24:04,122
Hasn't he left already?

245
00:24:04,327 --> 00:24:05,680
Why is he back?

246
00:24:05,927 --> 00:24:07,246
I will not see him!

247
00:24:07,887 --> 00:24:08,922
If you won't give him up...

248
00:24:09,607 --> 00:24:11,006
Get out! Go away with him!

249
00:24:13,927 --> 00:24:15,997
I assumed that Mr. Wang
played it so loud...

250
00:24:16,327 --> 00:24:17,885
...because he loved his opera

251
00:24:18,527 --> 00:24:21,564
Actually he didn't want anyone
to overhear the family row

252
00:25:16,367 --> 00:25:17,846
What are you doing?

253
00:25:28,607 --> 00:25:30,086
Come back for me when
you're a little older!

254
00:25:33,487 --> 00:25:34,442
I said. Wait till you grow up!

255
00:25:39,407 --> 00:25:40,806
I like it

256
00:25:42,727 --> 00:25:43,842
Mr. Wang thought about very little

257
00:25:44,407 --> 00:25:46,284
...but his two daughters

258
00:25:46,847 --> 00:25:47,677
The elder one was crazy
about her Japanese man

259
00:25:48,847 --> 00:25:50,041
The younger one was
precocious for her age

260
00:25:50,807 --> 00:25:52,843
She kept coming into
my room for drinks

261
00:25:53,407 --> 00:25:55,762
Then she ran off with some man

262
00:25:56,567 --> 00:25:59,127
Another drummer from a
club band. I heard

263
00:26:00,087 --> 00:26:03,204
After she left. her elder
sister got into trouble too

264
00:26:03,727 --> 00:26:04,876
Hey. have a word with
your boss for me

265
00:26:05,167 --> 00:26:06,077
I'm a bit late with the rent

266
00:26:06,567 --> 00:26:07,761
Anyway. he has my deposit

267
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:10,923
Mr. Chow. tell him yourself

268
00:26:11,247 --> 00:26:12,396
He's in a foul mood these days

269
00:26:13,087 --> 00:26:14,042
What's eating him?

270
00:26:14,967 --> 00:26:15,922
First. one daughter ran away

271
00:26:16,607 --> 00:26:17,835
Now the other one's in hospital

272
00:26:18,327 --> 00:26:19,442
That's why he's so angry

273
00:26:19,687 --> 00:26:20,915
Why is she in hospital?

274
00:26:21,207 --> 00:26:22,959
He wouldn't say. he was
quite strange...

275
00:26:23,767 --> 00:26:25,200
Steer clear of him!

276
00:26:25,527 --> 00:26:26,562
So. that's it?

277
00:26:27,567 --> 00:26:28,682
Anyhow. give him my invitation

278
00:26:28,967 --> 00:26:30,082
It's my father's birthday banquet

279
00:26:30,567 --> 00:26:32,239
He can deduct his gift
from the rent I owe

280
00:26:35,327 --> 00:26:38,637
Later they imposed a
curfew in Hong Kong

281
00:26:39,687 --> 00:26:40,836
Home-made bombs caused panic

282
00:26:41,727 --> 00:26:43,638
The economy stopped dead

283
00:26:45,727 --> 00:26:47,126
I stopped going out

284
00:26:48,247 --> 00:26:49,600
Some thought I was a
reformed character

285
00:26:50,287 --> 00:26:51,925
Actually. I was writing

286
00:26:52,687 --> 00:26:54,325
A story called 2046

287
00:26:55,167 --> 00:26:56,680
All about men and women
looking for love...

288
00:26:57,327 --> 00:27:00,000
...risking everything to
get to a place called 2046

289
00:27:00,727 --> 00:27:01,716
What's that?

290
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:04,323
Let's go to...

291
00:27:05,367 --> 00:27:06,561
2046.

292
00:27:06,927 --> 00:27:09,316
I made it as bizarre and erotic as
possible. without crossing the line

293
00:27:10,207 --> 00:27:11,401
The readers liked it

294
00:27:13,127 --> 00:27:16,403
Some didn't take to the
science-fiction angle

295
00:27:17,207 --> 00:27:18,276
But all '2046' meant to me was...

296
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:20,605
...the number of a hotel room

297
00:27:24,407 --> 00:27:25,726
I made up the whole thing

298
00:27:26,247 --> 00:27:29,000
But some of my own experiences
found their way into it

299
00:29:53,487 --> 00:29:55,205
People I ran into in the normal
course of things...

300
00:29:55,647 --> 00:29:57,205
...turned up in my stories

301
00:29:57,607 --> 00:30:00,201
I felt more and more at ease
in my fictional world

302
00:30:10,647 --> 00:30:13,366
Around that time. Mr. Wang's
music got louder again

303
00:30:15,007 --> 00:30:15,996
More trouble with his two
daughters...

304
00:30:17,167 --> 00:30:19,283
But also because of the bad
state of the economy

305
00:30:19,527 --> 00:30:21,279
Allot of the rooms were empty

306
00:30:22,047 --> 00:30:24,641
Then in September
the rioting ended

307
00:30:25,127 --> 00:30:26,958
Life went back to normal

308
00:30:34,327 --> 00:30:37,399
Soon. someone moved into 2046

309
00:30:45,447 --> 00:30:46,766
Have you nearly finished?

310
00:30:47,327 --> 00:30:48,760
It's too early in the day for that!

311
00:30:49,447 --> 00:30:51,278
Some of us are trying to sleep!

312
00:31:49,327 --> 00:31:50,760
Peeking?

313
00:31:51,447 --> 00:31:52,641
The woman next door is quite a dish!

314
00:31:52,927 --> 00:31:53,962
What are my chances?

315
00:31:54,327 --> 00:31:55,316
You're off your head!

316
00:31:55,767 --> 00:31:57,519
A father-to-be shouldn't have
that on his mind!

317
00:31:58,087 --> 00:31:59,236
Now she's pregnant

318
00:31:59,487 --> 00:32:00,522
My wife won't let me touch her!

319
00:32:01,127 --> 00:32:02,446
Come on

320
00:32:05,687 --> 00:32:06,278
Put in a word for me

321
00:32:06,967 --> 00:32:08,036
Okay...

322
00:32:08,847 --> 00:32:09,882
How much?

323
00:32:10,727 --> 00:32:12,206
How much have you got?

324
00:32:13,807 --> 00:32:15,035
Only $100...

325
00:32:15,287 --> 00:32:16,163
Wait for my call

326
00:32:16,367 --> 00:32:17,925
Mr. Chow!

327
00:32:18,127 --> 00:32:21,676
Mr. Chow. a call for you!

328
00:32:22,047 --> 00:32:23,036
Bright and early. huh?

329
00:32:24,127 --> 00:32:25,321
She's not up yet

330
00:32:27,687 --> 00:32:28,756
Why come over?

331
00:32:29,127 --> 00:32:30,355
I told you
It has to be arranged

332
00:32:30,607 --> 00:32:33,804
She's not some streetwalker!

333
00:32:35,687 --> 00:32:37,279
A fellow artist like you

334
00:32:37,567 --> 00:32:38,886
Show her a little respect
will you?

335
00:32:40,647 --> 00:32:42,638
Yes. I'll tell you right away!

336
00:32:44,687 --> 00:32:46,086
Miss Bai. your key

337
00:32:47,767 --> 00:32:49,120
You're back. Miss Bai

338
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:03,966
Who is it?

339
00:33:04,247 --> 00:33:04,963
Who are you looking for?

340
00:33:05,207 --> 00:33:06,720
Mr. Chow suggested I come by...

341
00:33:08,327 --> 00:33:09,362
You're back. Mr. Chow

342
00:33:10,487 --> 00:33:11,840
Did you win on the dogs?

343
00:33:12,247 --> 00:33:14,397
I lost! I won a little

344
00:33:36,727 --> 00:33:37,842
Looking for me?

345
00:33:42,887 --> 00:33:44,923
I think you know this person?

346
00:33:47,087 --> 00:33:48,202
What are doing in that room?

347
00:33:48,447 --> 00:33:51,359
You said you'd arrange it!
I paid you!

348
00:33:51,607 --> 00:33:52,881
When did I say it was this room?

349
00:33:53,127 --> 00:33:55,083
I said that room
I said this one

350
00:33:55,287 --> 00:33:57,005
Your girl's in that room

351
00:33:57,767 --> 00:33:58,882
How embarrassing!
Please excuse him

352
00:33:59,647 --> 00:34:01,603
I told you. the room on the left!

353
00:34:01,887 --> 00:34:03,605
I said I wanted that one!
Shut up!

354
00:34:06,007 --> 00:34:06,757
Who is it?

355
00:34:13,047 --> 00:34:14,162
Oh. you again!

356
00:34:14,927 --> 00:34:17,999
I just wanted to apologize
for last night

357
00:34:18,527 --> 00:34:19,676
Forget it

358
00:34:19,927 --> 00:34:20,803
Go away

359
00:34:28,807 --> 00:34:30,081
Ping. my editor. was out of line

360
00:34:30,647 --> 00:34:31,762
But he's not really so bad

361
00:34:32,727 --> 00:34:35,685
Just a bit stingy!
Never pays his way!

362
00:34:36,487 --> 00:34:38,159
Always says he's broke
when the check arrives

363
00:34:38,887 --> 00:34:40,002
So I thought I'd play a trick on him

364
00:34:42,367 --> 00:34:46,155
At my expense?
Didn't you go a bit far?

365
00:34:48,047 --> 00:34:49,765
He only fell for it because
you're so beautiful

366
00:34:50,167 --> 00:34:53,364
You're quite a flirt!

367
00:34:54,767 --> 00:34:56,166
Just stating the fact!

368
00:34:57,927 --> 00:34:59,246
A small token of apology...

369
00:35:01,327 --> 00:35:03,158
Please accept it

370
00:35:04,607 --> 00:35:05,596
I don't want it

371
00:35:06,527 --> 00:35:08,802
You're still cross. aren't you?

372
00:35:10,287 --> 00:35:12,084
Please accept it
No!

373
00:35:12,447 --> 00:35:14,517
Come on...
No!

374
00:35:14,687 --> 00:35:16,040
It's just a token...

375
00:35:17,807 --> 00:35:20,958
Don't make fun of me
I mean what I say!

376
00:35:21,247 --> 00:35:22,441
Now. get out!

377
00:35:27,087 --> 00:35:28,998
That's good. let it all out

378
00:35:30,487 --> 00:35:31,715
How can I make you feel better?

379
00:35:32,207 --> 00:35:33,845
Slap me again!

380
00:35:34,047 --> 00:35:35,275
Think I wouldn’t dare?

381
00:35:36,127 --> 00:35:37,446
Come closer!

382
00:35:43,207 --> 00:35:44,959
Bastard!

383
00:35:53,327 --> 00:35:54,680
Don't be so petty!

384
00:35:55,167 --> 00:35:56,282
That's enough

385
00:35:57,407 --> 00:35:59,967
I'm courteous enough not to
slap you again

386
00:36:00,727 --> 00:36:02,001
That doesn't mean you can
take advantage!

387
00:36:04,527 --> 00:36:06,677
This time I'll give you face

388
00:36:08,527 --> 00:36:11,519
If there's ever a next time
I'll be less polite

389
00:36:12,127 --> 00:36:13,446
It won't happen again

390
00:36:14,047 --> 00:36:15,446
My face is still numb

391
00:36:17,087 --> 00:36:18,236
Accept it!

392
00:36:18,687 --> 00:36:19,517
No!

393
00:36:21,207 --> 00:36:22,481
They're just a token of my regard

394
00:36:23,607 --> 00:36:25,086
I chose them myself

395
00:36:26,647 --> 00:36:29,559
See if you like them

396
00:36:29,807 --> 00:36:31,320
If you don't. just throw them away

397
00:36:40,927 --> 00:36:42,155
Good

398
00:36:50,807 --> 00:36:52,525
I'll leave now

399
00:37:10,247 --> 00:37:12,681
Calm down!

400
00:37:15,087 --> 00:37:18,443
It's none of your business
who I dated last night!

401
00:37:21,647 --> 00:37:22,602
Who?

402
00:37:24,527 --> 00:37:26,006
Dabao!

403
00:37:27,887 --> 00:37:29,445
Which Dabao?

404
00:37:30,527 --> 00:37:32,722
The fat one or the skinny one?

405
00:37:33,287 --> 00:37:35,118
From Shanghai or from Shandong?

406
00:37:36,207 --> 00:37:39,517
The trouble is
I know so many men named Dabao

407
00:37:40,087 --> 00:37:41,918
How should I know which one you mean?

408
00:37:45,207 --> 00:37:46,196
Yes. I did

409
00:37:46,727 --> 00:37:48,683
What are you going to do about it?

410
00:37:51,367 --> 00:37:52,277
Fine!

411
00:37:52,767 --> 00:37:54,120
I'll be waiting!

412
00:38:00,047 --> 00:38:00,923
Let me just say...

413
00:38:02,047 --> 00:38:03,082
Get out!

414
00:38:04,047 --> 00:38:05,924
You think I can accept this?

415
00:38:06,327 --> 00:38:08,283
Her or me

416
00:38:08,527 --> 00:38:10,006
You'd better choose!

417
00:38:10,167 --> 00:38:11,486
Now get out!

418
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:51,803
24 December 1967

419
00:39:20,007 --> 00:39:21,281
You're back early!

420
00:39:21,647 --> 00:39:22,682
It's Christmas!

421
00:39:23,087 --> 00:39:24,361
Shouldn’t you behaving
dinner with your boyfriend?

422
00:39:25,687 --> 00:39:26,722
What boyfriend?

423
00:39:32,527 --> 00:39:33,926
Then let's have supper!

424
00:39:34,167 --> 00:39:35,156
Come on...

425
00:39:35,967 --> 00:39:39,516
You have so many girl friends!
You need company?

426
00:39:40,487 --> 00:39:41,397
Go out with them!

427
00:39:44,487 --> 00:39:46,318
They all want to be with me
but I can't choose

428
00:39:47,127 --> 00:39:48,924
The fairest thing is to see
none of them

429
00:39:50,287 --> 00:39:52,517
Come on. no point in staying
cooped up in your room

430
00:39:54,167 --> 00:39:55,156
I'm not in a good mood tonight

431
00:39:57,167 --> 00:39:58,043
I might get drunk...

432
00:39:59,247 --> 00:40:00,965
...and slap you again

433
00:40:04,047 --> 00:40:05,116
That's okay

434
00:40:05,767 --> 00:40:07,280
I'm used to it!

435
00:40:08,047 --> 00:40:09,036
If slapping me would make you happy

436
00:40:09,367 --> 00:40:11,119
take that as my Christmas present!

437
00:40:15,087 --> 00:40:16,042
Come on...

438
00:40:16,647 --> 00:40:17,602
Come with me

439
00:40:19,167 --> 00:40:20,282
Let go!

440
00:40:45,847 --> 00:40:47,803
I didn't expect to spend
Christmas Like this

441
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:50,436
What were you expecting?

442
00:40:54,087 --> 00:40:55,202
We'd made plans

443
00:40:56,847 --> 00:40:58,405
He was taking me to Singapore

444
00:41:00,727 --> 00:41:02,957
He says it's warm
there at Christmas

445
00:41:09,487 --> 00:41:11,796
So I didn't even
pack winter clothes

446
00:41:13,767 --> 00:41:14,995
What I'm wearing now...

447
00:41:16,727 --> 00:41:18,126
...is for summer!

448
00:41:26,367 --> 00:41:27,846
Have you been to Singapore?

449
00:41:30,567 --> 00:41:32,319
I worked there for several years

450
00:41:36,927 --> 00:41:37,996
What kind of work?

451
00:41:39,007 --> 00:41:40,440
On a newspaper

452
00:41:43,367 --> 00:41:44,641
Is it fun there?

453
00:41:46,567 --> 00:41:47,397
It's okay

454
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:54,280
Tell me more

455
00:41:55,847 --> 00:41:56,916
I won't be going...

456
00:41:58,527 --> 00:42:00,085
So I'll just have to imagine it

457
00:42:06,167 --> 00:42:07,441
What do you want to know?

458
00:42:14,647 --> 00:42:16,080
How's the climate?

459
00:42:20,447 --> 00:42:21,436
Pretty warm

460
00:42:22,967 --> 00:42:24,161
All year round

461
00:42:25,607 --> 00:42:27,484
Sometimes you can't tell
what season it is

462
00:42:31,207 --> 00:42:32,526
The food stalls are great!

463
00:42:33,887 --> 00:42:35,923
Ping and I ate there after work

464
00:42:37,207 --> 00:42:39,198
We'd eat and drink till dawn

465
00:42:46,167 --> 00:42:47,566
Our land lord was a funny man

466
00:42:48,727 --> 00:42:50,604
Short and fat
and he always wore a skirt...

467
00:42:52,487 --> 00:42:54,842
What the Malays call a 'sarong'

468
00:42:58,407 --> 00:42:59,920
But when you're away from home

469
00:43:01,727 --> 00:43:03,001
...it sometimes gets boring

470
00:43:15,247 --> 00:43:16,680
That was a dull meal!

471
00:43:17,687 --> 00:43:18,961
Another drink somewhere else?

472
00:43:20,847 --> 00:43:22,166
You really Like to drink?

473
00:43:23,687 --> 00:43:24,961
It makes things easy

474
00:43:25,487 --> 00:43:27,318
When I'm drunk. I have no worries!

475
00:43:29,807 --> 00:43:33,356
Won't your girl friends be
missing you tonight?

476
00:43:34,727 --> 00:43:36,001
They're not stuck to me!

477
00:43:36,487 --> 00:43:37,840
They see other men too

478
00:43:38,727 --> 00:43:39,796
We just have fun together

479
00:43:41,007 --> 00:43:42,725
They still need to make a living!

480
00:43:45,007 --> 00:43:45,917
I don't get it

481
00:43:47,047 --> 00:43:49,481
Where does all that fun get you?

482
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:51,446
If you find the right person...

483
00:43:52,247 --> 00:43:53,316
...why waste time on the others?

484
00:43:54,207 --> 00:43:55,481
If I find the right person!

485
00:43:56,407 --> 00:43:57,522
A man Like me has nothing much

486
00:43:58,087 --> 00:43:58,997
...except free time

487
00:44:00,007 --> 00:44:02,157
That's why I need company

488
00:44:03,927 --> 00:44:05,201
So people are just time-fillers to you?

489
00:44:06,127 --> 00:44:07,116
I wouldn’t say that

490
00:44:08,767 --> 00:44:10,917
Other people can borrow my time too

491
00:44:13,647 --> 00:44:15,080
And this evening?

492
00:44:15,847 --> 00:44:17,644
Are you borrowing me or am
I borrowing you?

493
00:44:18,367 --> 00:44:19,356
No difference!

494
00:44:20,527 --> 00:44:21,926
Maybe I borrowed you earlier...

495
00:44:22,487 --> 00:44:24,125
...and now you're borrowing me

496
00:44:24,527 --> 00:44:25,562
Ridiculous!

497
00:44:30,767 --> 00:44:32,041
Don't get me wrong

498
00:44:33,887 --> 00:44:35,718
I don't intend to take advantage
of you

499
00:44:37,447 --> 00:44:38,402
If that was what I wanted...

500
00:44:38,887 --> 00:44:40,286
...I had plenty of options

501
00:44:41,447 --> 00:44:43,403
I just want us to be drinking pals

502
00:44:45,567 --> 00:44:46,920
Is that okay?

503
00:44:49,447 --> 00:44:50,436
It's hard

504
00:44:51,647 --> 00:44:53,205
But I'll give it a try

505
00:44:55,887 --> 00:44:57,286
Okay...

506
00:44:58,367 --> 00:44:59,925
Let's try!

507
00:45:04,047 --> 00:45:05,878
Where to? Let's drink!

508
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:39,482
Mr. Chow. you seem happy tonight!

509
00:46:40,087 --> 00:46:41,839
I certainly am
my friends are buying me dinner

510
00:46:43,087 --> 00:46:43,837
This way please...

511
00:46:46,607 --> 00:46:48,518
Ping! Is it someone's birthday?

512
00:46:48,807 --> 00:46:52,277
Better than that
Chow has a new girlfriend!

513
00:46:53,167 --> 00:46:54,998
Definitely worth celebrating!

514
00:46:55,647 --> 00:46:56,841
Mr. Chow. what would you
Like to eat tonight?

515
00:46:57,767 --> 00:46:59,837
Something expensive!

516
00:47:01,127 --> 00:47:01,843
Snake?

517
00:47:02,327 --> 00:47:03,123
Yes. snake would be good

518
00:47:03,687 --> 00:47:05,245
Snake isn't cheap
Can you afford it?

519
00:47:05,447 --> 00:47:06,118
Sure you'll win the bet?

520
00:47:06,607 --> 00:47:08,086
Shut up! Don't mind him

521
00:47:08,727 --> 00:47:10,001
What'll it be
Mr. Chow? Snake!

522
00:47:10,927 --> 00:47:12,121
And a lamb casserole too

523
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:14,282
And bring Hoi's whiskey

524
00:47:14,807 --> 00:47:15,557
Yes! Good!

525
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:34,837
Can't Let this go to waste
it's delicious

526
00:47:35,487 --> 00:47:36,886
Where's your girl. Chow?

527
00:47:37,487 --> 00:47:39,876
It's already 2 a. m.
Is she coming?

528
00:47:41,287 --> 00:47:44,882
She can't be coming

529
00:47:45,567 --> 00:47:46,158
I don't think she's coming

530
00:47:46,407 --> 00:47:47,556
It's all your fault

531
00:47:47,887 --> 00:47:49,206
It's because of you
that this happened

532
00:47:49,407 --> 00:47:50,044
Why blame me?

533
00:47:50,407 --> 00:47:51,920
You brought this on yourself

534
00:47:52,247 --> 00:47:54,807
You said she was gentle and obedient

535
00:47:55,407 --> 00:47:56,237
Now we know the truth!

536
00:47:57,567 --> 00:47:59,285
I said she was sometimes obedient...

537
00:47:59,927 --> 00:48:01,645
...and sometimes gentle

538
00:48:02,767 --> 00:48:05,565
But she's full of surprises
that's part of the fun

539
00:48:06,407 --> 00:48:08,967
So. what next?
Yes. what now?

540
00:48:09,167 --> 00:48:11,442
Whatever you feel Like doing

541
00:48:16,807 --> 00:48:18,684
And then what happened?

542
00:48:19,207 --> 00:48:20,401
Tell me!

543
00:48:25,967 --> 00:48:27,798
How are you going to thank me?

544
00:48:32,687 --> 00:48:34,837
Pervert!

545
00:48:43,127 --> 00:48:44,355
Open up!

546
00:48:44,967 --> 00:48:45,604
Who is it?

547
00:48:45,847 --> 00:48:47,121
Open the door!

548
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:50,916
It's late

549
00:48:52,767 --> 00:48:54,564
You played a fine joke
on me tonight

550
00:48:55,567 --> 00:48:57,319
I finished work Late

551
00:48:57,687 --> 00:48:59,757
Too Late to get there

552
00:49:00,727 --> 00:49:02,001
So I didn't come

553
00:49:05,687 --> 00:49:06,676
What's this?

554
00:49:07,127 --> 00:49:09,846
That's your fault too

555
00:49:11,687 --> 00:49:12,915
How could I know
you'd stand me up?

556
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:17,760
I thought I'd win a few hundred

557
00:49:18,327 --> 00:49:19,726
Instead I lost my moustache

558
00:49:20,367 --> 00:49:21,482
This is all your fault

559
00:49:23,607 --> 00:49:25,962
You deserved it

560
00:49:26,767 --> 00:49:27,882
Who pushed you into the bet?

561
00:49:30,847 --> 00:49:31,836
I'll tell you something...

562
00:49:32,607 --> 00:49:34,165
Ping asked me not to show up

563
00:49:35,847 --> 00:49:36,802
Anyhow...

564
00:49:37,367 --> 00:49:39,517
I wasn't that fond of
the moustache

565
00:49:41,647 --> 00:49:43,000
You look younger now

566
00:49:44,727 --> 00:49:45,955
Don't you Like it?

567
00:49:48,247 --> 00:49:49,316
You're making fun of me!

568
00:49:51,167 --> 00:49:52,646
You tricked me!

569
00:49:56,727 --> 00:49:58,445
I'll get you for this

570
00:50:01,327 --> 00:50:02,237
How will you make it up to me?

571
00:50:03,327 --> 00:50:04,203
At least give me a kiss

572
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:09,802
You bit me!

573
00:50:10,207 --> 00:50:11,003
Come and get me!

574
00:50:13,767 --> 00:50:15,803
You're in for it when
I catch you!

575
00:50:19,167 --> 00:50:20,316
Don't touch me there!

576
00:50:36,407 --> 00:50:37,476
What?

577
00:50:40,447 --> 00:50:41,402
What are you doing?

578
00:50:41,847 --> 00:50:44,486
Shaving you Don't!

579
00:50:45,287 --> 00:50:47,323
Who knows where that shaver's been?

580
00:50:48,527 --> 00:50:49,437
It could bring me bad luck

581
00:50:57,687 --> 00:50:58,642
Let's go for Round Two!

582
00:51:22,367 --> 00:51:23,516
Why are you dressed?

583
00:51:28,367 --> 00:51:29,322
I'm going back to my room...

584
00:51:30,327 --> 00:51:31,476
I'm exhausted

585
00:51:37,287 --> 00:51:38,561
This is all I have

586
00:51:39,927 --> 00:51:41,246
Aside from loose change for the bus

587
00:51:43,287 --> 00:51:44,561
Here's $200

588
00:51:46,847 --> 00:51:48,246
Please take it

589
00:51:48,487 --> 00:51:49,920
I don't want it

590
00:51:50,527 --> 00:51:51,755
I wasn't selling

591
00:51:53,127 --> 00:51:54,401
That's not how I meant it

592
00:51:55,087 --> 00:51:58,318
I want to pay for
your torn dress

593
00:51:59,127 --> 00:52:00,003
Please take it

594
00:52:03,847 --> 00:52:04,802
I see...

595
00:52:06,247 --> 00:52:08,556
You're afraid I'll cling to
you. is that it?

596
00:52:14,127 --> 00:52:15,116
Fine...

597
00:52:15,607 --> 00:52:16,835
I'll take $10

598
00:52:17,967 --> 00:52:19,719
Think of it as a discount rate

599
00:52:23,647 --> 00:52:24,875
If you ever want to come over again

600
00:52:26,207 --> 00:52:27,526
...I'll charge the same

601
00:53:59,287 --> 00:54:00,800
I'm going back to my room

602
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:31,206
Come here

603
00:55:02,127 --> 00:55:03,242
Not tonight

604
00:55:04,327 --> 00:55:05,237
Why not?

605
00:55:06,647 --> 00:55:08,285
Not in the mood?

606
00:55:10,727 --> 00:55:12,206
Can't take the strain tonight

607
00:55:14,407 --> 00:55:16,921
Anyhow. I'm a bit short of cash

608
00:55:18,167 --> 00:55:21,716
Never mind. you can owe me

609
00:55:25,087 --> 00:55:25,758
No....

610
00:55:27,047 --> 00:55:28,196
I don't Like being in debt

611
00:55:50,167 --> 00:55:51,520
The reception's at 6. dinner at 8

612
00:55:51,967 --> 00:55:53,798
I don't mind if you can't make it
just send your gift

613
00:55:55,287 --> 00:55:56,322
No more than you do!

614
00:55:56,767 --> 00:55:58,120
You hold banquets all year round!

615
00:55:58,367 --> 00:55:59,800
I've had four birthday invitations
from you this year!

616
00:56:00,687 --> 00:56:02,917
I'll send over some more
invitation cards later

617
00:56:03,407 --> 00:56:04,396
Think of people with money...

618
00:56:04,687 --> 00:56:06,439
Write in their names and send
them invitations!

619
00:56:06,687 --> 00:56:08,040
Okay. that's settled

620
00:56:08,367 --> 00:56:09,482
Mr. Chow. holding another banquet?

621
00:56:10,447 --> 00:56:12,597
You know we have birthdays
indifferent calendars?

622
00:56:13,127 --> 00:56:14,526
Another of mine has come around

623
00:56:14,847 --> 00:56:15,802
No doubt

624
00:56:16,327 --> 00:56:19,160
Here's one for your boss Alright

625
00:56:19,487 --> 00:56:20,761
Tell him that since
we're so close...

626
00:56:21,007 --> 00:56:23,077
He can deduct his gift from
the rent I owe

627
00:56:24,247 --> 00:56:25,282
Make sure he gets it

628
00:56:25,647 --> 00:56:26,284
Okay

629
00:56:31,527 --> 00:56:32,926
It's Late. what's so urgent?

630
00:56:33,367 --> 00:56:35,119
Just got back from Macau

631
00:56:35,367 --> 00:56:36,925
Chow asked me to bring
you a present

632
00:56:39,887 --> 00:56:40,717
You two went to Macau?

633
00:56:41,287 --> 00:56:43,198
Yes. we had some days off

634
00:56:43,687 --> 00:56:44,881
So we went to the casino

635
00:56:52,127 --> 00:56:53,401
Oh. it's beautiful

636
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:56,358
He says he found some money...

637
00:56:56,967 --> 00:56:58,320
...in his pocket

638
00:56:58,927 --> 00:57:01,487
So before losing it all
at the tables...

639
00:57:02,527 --> 00:57:03,482
...he bought you a present

640
00:57:06,127 --> 00:57:06,957
Where is he?

641
00:57:07,767 --> 00:57:10,600
Not back yet
You know what he's Like

642
00:57:11,407 --> 00:57:12,522
Extravagant at
the start of the month

643
00:57:13,047 --> 00:57:14,400
...and broke well before the end

644
00:57:15,007 --> 00:57:17,157
He made several thousand
hosting that party

645
00:57:17,887 --> 00:57:19,002
So now he's really
enjoying himself!

646
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:21,162
Is he there alone?

647
00:57:21,807 --> 00:57:23,559
Of course not!
There's a gang of them

648
00:57:24,327 --> 00:57:25,680
He likes company

649
00:57:27,887 --> 00:57:29,081
Was he always Like this?

650
00:57:29,727 --> 00:57:31,285
Let's not talk about him
Let’s have a drink

651
00:57:37,487 --> 00:57:39,159
But I should warn you...

652
00:57:40,007 --> 00:57:41,042
I know you Like Chow a lot

653
00:57:41,967 --> 00:57:44,037
Don't waste your time on him

654
00:57:44,527 --> 00:57:45,277
He's not serious!

655
00:58:06,607 --> 00:58:07,835
Guess who?

656
00:58:08,607 --> 00:58:10,802
There's only one possibility!

657
00:58:12,487 --> 00:58:13,522
Let me have a bite first!

658
00:58:22,447 --> 00:58:23,562
What are you doing here?

659
00:58:27,327 --> 00:58:28,476
What am I doing here?

660
00:58:29,967 --> 00:58:31,002
What do you think?

661
00:59:03,847 --> 00:59:05,280
I thought I was pretty wild

662
00:59:06,607 --> 00:59:08,245
But you're much wilder!

663
00:59:10,087 --> 00:59:10,917
Pay up!

664
00:59:12,407 --> 00:59:14,284
I haven't seen you for ages

665
00:59:16,367 --> 00:59:17,356
I've been busy

666
00:59:18,447 --> 00:59:19,402
Liar

667
00:59:20,007 --> 00:59:21,884
Tell me the truth

668
00:59:24,007 --> 00:59:24,837
I am!

669
00:59:29,247 --> 00:59:30,805
Who was that woman the other day?

670
00:59:33,607 --> 00:59:34,483
What woman?

671
00:59:35,847 --> 00:59:36,677
Don't pretend

672
00:59:39,367 --> 00:59:41,642
I saw her leaving your room

673
00:59:43,087 --> 00:59:44,236
Who is she?

674
00:59:45,687 --> 00:59:46,483
A friend

675
00:59:46,967 --> 00:59:47,877
A friend?

676
00:59:51,567 --> 00:59:53,285
What was she doing in your room?

677
00:59:55,007 --> 00:59:56,326
Don't be nosy. alright?

678
00:59:57,527 --> 00:59:58,437
Go back to your room

679
00:59:59,327 --> 01:00:00,316
I have work to do

680
01:00:05,487 --> 01:00:06,522
I won't!

681
01:00:08,927 --> 01:00:10,280
I'm sleeping here tonight

682
01:00:11,927 --> 01:00:13,280
An overnight stay is expensive

683
01:00:13,727 --> 01:00:14,637
No problem

684
01:00:15,327 --> 01:00:16,726
Name your price

685
01:00:18,367 --> 01:00:21,757
I'd pay anything to be with you
Every day

686
01:00:23,727 --> 01:00:24,523
Retail is fine

687
01:00:25,767 --> 01:00:27,086
Wholesale is out of the question

688
01:00:27,967 --> 01:00:28,843
Why?

689
01:00:29,527 --> 01:00:30,562
I just don't Like it

690
01:00:33,567 --> 01:00:34,966
Could you make an exception for me?

691
01:00:36,407 --> 01:00:37,123
No

692
01:00:40,687 --> 01:00:42,518
You treat all women Like this?

693
01:00:44,127 --> 01:00:45,037
Except one

694
01:00:45,887 --> 01:00:46,637
Who?

695
01:00:47,367 --> 01:00:48,436
My mother

696
01:00:48,687 --> 01:00:49,722
I'm serious

697
01:00:54,127 --> 01:00:55,879
I don't mind you having other women

698
01:00:57,287 --> 01:00:58,720
But I won't be treated
the same as them

699
01:01:05,007 --> 01:01:06,201
I don't care if you love me or not

700
01:01:08,327 --> 01:01:09,601
I'II Love you anyway

701
01:01:13,407 --> 01:01:15,159
Since we got together. I haven't
brought other men back

702
01:01:17,967 --> 01:01:19,719
I hoped you'd think the same way

703
01:01:22,687 --> 01:01:23,802
Will you promise me that?

704
01:01:24,487 --> 01:01:25,363
No

705
01:01:38,967 --> 01:01:39,922
I see...

706
01:01:42,087 --> 01:01:43,122
Then we're through

707
01:01:49,727 --> 01:01:50,796
I'll never bother you

708
01:01:51,727 --> 01:01:52,876
And I don't ever want you in
my room again

709
01:01:58,927 --> 01:01:59,837
Here. $10

710
01:02:01,207 --> 01:02:02,799
Tonight. I'm paying

711
01:02:08,847 --> 01:02:09,802
Thank you!

712
01:02:11,487 --> 01:02:13,842
If you're ever in the mood
feel free to come over

713
01:02:15,367 --> 01:02:16,880
I'll charge you the same

714
01:02:34,687 --> 01:02:35,563
Having fun?

715
01:02:37,007 --> 01:02:37,996
What do you care?
