1
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:05,961
Timed and captioned by elementxstyle

2
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,540
Tis a truth universally acknowledged.

3
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:44,003
That a zombie in possession of
brains must be in want of more brains.

4
00:00:45,933 --> 00:00:47,580
Never was this truth more plain

5
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:50,184
than in the recent attacks at Netherfield Park.

6
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:56,700
In which an entire household was slaughtered
by a horde of the living dead during a whist party.

7
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:04,740
Who goes there?

8
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:08,747
Who goes there?

9
00:01:09,088 --> 00:01:13,740
Darcy. Colonel Darcy.

10
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:48,420
No zombie bite marks on this pristine young body.

11
00:01:58,580 --> 00:01:59,606
Father.

12
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:06,326
How are you able to discern that the
wound from my rib was from fencing?

13
00:02:06,358 --> 00:02:09,500
Been a bit a long time my son.

14
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,740
I have no wound.

15
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:22,620
More sherry for Mr. Kingston please.

16
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:27,311
Darcy?

17
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:33,580
Carry on, we've absolutely nothing to hide.

18
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:36,540
Please, everyone enjoy.

19
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,700
Mr. Darcy.

20
00:02:44,104 --> 00:02:48,460
Colonel Darcy, Mrs. Featherstone
I'm here on official business.

21
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:53,540
There's been a report that
somebody here has been bitten.

22
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:54,700
Surely not.

23
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:58,620
There hasn't been a zombie
incident in over two years.

24
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,700
I assure you we've taken every precaution.

25
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:07,660
A newly infected zombie is
almost impossible to detect.

26
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:10,580
Until they've ingested their
first human brains, at which point

27
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:13,500
the transformation accelerates
with every subsequent kill.

28
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:17,620
Yes, we are all well aware
of how it works Col. Darcy.

29
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:23,660
Well? Are you quite satisfied?

30
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:26,580
Quite.

31
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:29,500
- Might I play a hand?
- Of course.

32
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:32,700
Good evening.

33
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:35,460
So shall we?

34
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,500
- A potion?
- Flies, madam.

35
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,175
I beg your pardon?

36
00:03:45,213 --> 00:03:46,038
Carrion flies.

37
00:03:47,113 --> 00:03:51,700
They're in possession of
but one truly, enviable talent.

38
00:03:54,107 --> 00:03:56,580
The ability to detect dead flesh.

39
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,431
I've won the trick!

40
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:01,304
A very crafty play Mr. Kingston.

41
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:05,500
I dare say, but the
buzzing is frightfully loud

42
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:08,253
It's not the buzzing that
should concern you madam.

43
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,740
But rather when the buzzing stops.

44
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,660
Oh dear.

45
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:53,620
Is there anyone else present?

46
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:56,700
Whom he would've had the
opportunity to infect?

47
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,740
A family member perhaps.

48
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,660
Good evening.

49
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,166
Mr. Kingston's niece is here!

50
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,620
There is no need to put that
girl through Mr. Darcy's interrogation.

51
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,660
Cassandra come back!

52
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,660
Annabelle.

53
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,620
Where are you?

54
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:45,620
Annabelle?

55
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:05,500
It wasn't always like this my dear daughters.

56
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:10,500
As the century began

57
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:15,269
Britannia was rich with the
fruits of world wide trade.

58
00:06:15,283 --> 00:06:18,620
From the colonies there came
not just silks and spices

59
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:21,660
but a virulent and abominable plague.

60
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:25,620
Naturally many suspected the French were to blame.

61
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:28,173
Are you surprised?

62
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:33,660
Once bitten, the newly infected were filled
with an insatiable hunger

63
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:36,580
for the brains of the living.

64
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:44,236
Millions perished, only to rise again.
As legions of undead.

65
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:47,540
So certain it would seem
the end of days had come.

66
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:53,266
But even the four horsemen of the apocalypse
are said to have ascended from hell.

67
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:57,460
To protect the living, the Grand Barrier was built.

68
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:00,660
A one hundred foot wall,
encircling London.

69
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:04,620
Then excavation began on the royal canal.

70
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:11,540
A vast mote thirty fathoms deep
surrounding both the city and its walls.

71
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:17,660
The land twixt the two fortifications
became known as The Inbetween.

72
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:23,540
At this time it became fashionable
to study the deadly arts of the orient.

73
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,620
Japan for the wealthy.

74
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:28,460
China for the wise.

75
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:34,233
In the second battle of Kent. One of the bridges
that cross the royal canal was breached.

76
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:39,300
Ravenous zombie hordes massacred
every villager of The Inbetween.

77
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:44,340
It was said the sight of this slaughter
drove young King George mad.

78
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:50,420
When the battle was finally won, he ordered
the destruction of all the bridges, save one.

79
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:51,540
Hingham Bridge.

80
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:57,980
Which to this day remains the only means
by which to cross the royal canal.

81
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:01,314
Many believed the enemy was finally vanquished.

82
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:05,756
The gentry began to leave the safe confines
of London's defenses.

83
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:08,507
For their newly fortified country estates.

84
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,860
But vigilance is still every essence.

85
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:15,820
Remember this.
Keep your swords as sharp as your wit.

86
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:22,620
For the ultimate battle between the living
and the undead has yet to be staged.

87
00:08:54,462 --> 00:08:55,262
Mr. Bennet!

88
00:08:56,462 --> 00:08:57,575
Mr. Bennet?

89
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:06,160
Mr. Bennet, have you heard that Netherfield Park is occupied again?

90
00:09:06,758 --> 00:09:08,344
By a Mr. Bingley

91
00:09:08,921 --> 00:09:12,480
A young single man of large fortune

92
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,860
Mrs. Long says his income has grown to 5,000 a year!

93
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:18,240
He is attending the village dance tonight.

94
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,820
How does this concern our warrior daughters?

95
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:22,820
How can you be so tiresome?

96
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,793
You know I mean for him
to marry one of them.

97
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:29,224
Daughters do not dance well
with masticated brains, Mrs. Bennet.

98
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:32,020
You sir have already put them
at a decided social disadvantage

99
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:34,626
by insisting they do their combat
training in China as opposed to Japan.

100
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,274
The Chinese deadly arts have no equal!

101
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:38,542
I for one would trade nothing
for my Shaolin training.

102
00:09:39,586 --> 00:09:41,523
You mustn't speak like that Lizzy.

103
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,942
I should like to go to the dance.

104
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:44,358
Do you think Mr. Bingley's handsome?

105
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:47,820
With his income Lydia, you'd think him
handsome if he had half a zombie face.

106
00:09:53,088 --> 00:09:56,024
You'll make me very very happy.

107
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,375
Well I suppose if we all go.

108
00:09:58,396 --> 00:09:58,935
No!

109
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:02,657
I don't care to be paraded like
a herd of heffers at a farm auction.

110
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:07,780
That's because you're the cow whose least
proficient in the art of tempting the other sex.

111
00:10:10,427 --> 00:10:10,845
Moo.

112
00:10:13,686 --> 00:10:17,820
Do not mistake my indulgence
for relaxation in discipline.

113
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,553
They must find husbands Mr. Bennet.

114
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:23,516
For as you know too well, they
shall inherit nothing when you pass.

115
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:26,220
Their immediate survival is my present concern.

116
00:10:26,351 --> 00:10:27,820
Be patient.

117
00:11:12,406 --> 00:11:15,820
Can I say you're easily five times as
beautiful as any other woman in this room.

118
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:18,740
- Stop it Liz.
- It's true.

119
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,198
These girls don't stand a chance.

120
00:11:20,535 --> 00:11:23,885
They say Mr. Bingley brought a
train of London dandies with him.

121
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:27,700
Smile Liz.

122
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,740
I will later.

123
00:11:35,683 --> 00:11:38,013
There's the handsome new master of Netherfield.

124
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:43,231
It was my understanding that
Captain Bingley was in want of a wife.

125
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:44,180
Oh he is!

126
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,627
Those are his sisters: Caroline Bingley and Louisa Hurst.

127
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:50,956
They say he inherited nearly a hundred thousand pounds.

128
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,590
What a magnificent husband he'd make.

129
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,900
Charlotte Lucas do you think of nothing else?

130
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:05,540
Zombies or no zombies all woman must think of marriage, Lizzy.

131
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:08,030
I shall never relinquish my sword for a ring.

132
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:09,040
For the right man you would.

133
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,550
The right man wouldn't ask me to.

134
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:15,690
Mr. Darcy!

135
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:17,580
Rather an imposing presence.

136
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:19,370
Owns half of Derbyshire!

137
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:21,940
Ten thousand pounds a year at least.

138
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,100
Welcome dear friend!

139
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:38,950
How are you?

140
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:39,740
How do you do?

141
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,610
I'm very well, how's this gentry rubbish?

142
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:42,340
Fine.

143
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,690
So this is merry?

144
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,440
She's the most beautiful creature I ever beheld.

145
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:00,850
She smiles too much.

146
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,550
She shows her age.

147
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:15,370
Charles Bingley, pleased to make your acquaintance.

148
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:16,580
Mrs. Bennet.

149
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:19,220
We've heard so much about you Mr. Bingley.

150
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:20,420
My daughters.

151
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,480
All of impeccable character.

152
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:28,880
May I introduce my friend, Mr. Darcy of Derbyshire.

153
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,980
Are you enjoying hutch Mr. Bingley?

154
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,320
Very much.

155
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:38,940
I've heard the library at Netherfield is one of the finest.

156
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:42,680
Library? Is it?

157
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:47,210
Ms. Bennet may I be so bold as
to request the next two dances.

158
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:49,460
If you're not otherwise engaged.

159
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,300
I'm not engaged.

160
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:56,930
Good for you Mr. Bingley, you chose
the loveliest of my daughters.

161
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:57,890
Mother!

162
00:13:57,890 --> 00:13:59,890
What?

163
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:05,100
I consider dancing to be the first refinement of
polished society, don't you agree Mr. Darcy?

164
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:07,210
Now every savage can dance.

165
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:10,020
Why I imagine even the zombies could do it with some degree of success.

166
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,170
Thank you.

167
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:39,780
Please don't forget our next dance Ms. Bennet.

168
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,780
Darcy...

169
00:14:44,873 --> 00:14:47,123
I hate to see you just standing there you must dance.

170
00:14:47,175 --> 00:14:49,740
Oh you know I detest it when I'm not acquainted with my partner.

171
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:51,780
- Oh, well.
- Darcy.

172
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:55,311
You'll dance with the only handsome girl here.

173
00:14:55,419 --> 00:14:58,740
Every one of her sisters is also very pretty dare I say.

174
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,702
Very agreeable.

175
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,180
Well she's tolerable but-

176
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:08,820
Tolerable?

177
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:12,462
Yes, tolerable. But not handsome enough tempt me.

178
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,817
Nor any other man here apparently.

179
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:18,420
Darcy, your standards my dear fellow-

180
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,860
Oh, that is unfortunate.

181
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,820
Mr. Darcy.

182
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:40,820
You insufferable prick.

183
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,820
It's William Darcy.

184
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:45,620
I quite detest the man.

185
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:48,601
So high and so conceited I can't enjoy him.

186
00:15:48,657 --> 00:15:49,561
Indeed.

187
00:15:50,556 --> 00:15:51,808
Wouldn't dance with him if he-

188
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:58,620
Mrs. Featherstone?

189
00:16:08,267 --> 00:16:09,820
You're undead!

190
00:16:10,674 --> 00:16:11,820
Shh..

191
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,266
I've come to tell you someth-

192
00:16:20,424 --> 00:16:21,753
What happened, Lizzy?

193
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,493
I narrowly saved her life.

194
00:16:24,886 --> 00:16:26,300
From Mrs. Featherstone?

195
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,700
From an undead Mrs. Featherstone.

196
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:31,740
I found her to be exceedingly tolerable.

197
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,700
Well done, Darcy.

198
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:34,740
Very heroic.

199
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,431
She was trying to tell me something.

200
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:37,610
A recipe perhaps?

201
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:41,008
Laugh as much as you choose.

202
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:43,161
But you shall not laugh me out of my opinion.

203
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,860
She posed no threat.

204
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:52,660
We're under attack!

205
00:17:48,587 --> 00:17:49,780
Their faces!

206
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:53,940
Rendered uncommonly intelligent
by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes.

207
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:58,080
And I'm forced to acknowledge
her figure as both light and pleasing.

208
00:17:59,398 --> 00:18:03,241
That her arms are surprisingly muscular
but not so much as to be unfeminine.

209
00:18:08,288 --> 00:18:10,796
Oh Lizzy I never saw such happy manners.

210
00:18:11,394 --> 00:18:13,260
So much ease with such good breeding.

211
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,441
I give you leave to like him.

212
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:17,005
You've liked many a stupid a person.

213
00:18:17,443 --> 00:18:19,394
He's just what a young man ought to be.

214
00:18:19,547 --> 00:18:22,020
Good humored, lively, handsome and-

215
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:22,573
Quite rich.

216
00:18:23,259 --> 00:18:25,820
But young men ought like wise to be if you possibly can.

217
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:28,580
Not as rich as Darcy.

218
00:18:31,346 --> 00:18:34,125
I saw how you liked at him when he first walked into the dance.

219
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:35,540
I hated him as if-

220
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:36,469
You liked him!

221
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:38,300
Hinted his manners in disgust!

222
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:40,940
He acts as if he were above our company and above being pitied.

223
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:42,300
Admit you find him handsome!

224
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:42,860
Handsome?

225
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:44,629
As his handsome does...

226
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:47,200
Mr. Darcy is therefore a very ill looking man.

227
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:51,547
You will not suck us down!

228
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:55,780
Never have I encountered a
man so consumed by his own pride!

229
00:18:55,968 --> 00:19:00,212
One cannot wonder that a so
very fine young man with family, fortune...

230
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:02,820
Everything in his favor, should think highly of himself.

231
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:08,620
If I may so expressing.

232
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:11,046
He has a right to be proud.

233
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,820
I can easily think of his pride.

234
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:17,820
If he had not mortified mine.

235
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:21,170
Pride is a very common failing I believe.

236
00:19:21,561 --> 00:19:25,353
Vanity and pride are different things so
they're words are often used synonymously.

237
00:19:25,387 --> 00:19:27,900
How's it make me proud without being vain?

238
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,780
Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves.

239
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:34,580
And vanity is what we would have others think of us.

240
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:41,019
Letter for Ms. Jane Bennet.

241
00:19:41,266 --> 00:19:43,095
He saved you from a zombie.

242
00:19:43,224 --> 00:19:45,613
Mrs. Featherstone was quite civilized!

243
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:49,580
Yield!

244
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:50,476
Never!

245
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:55,126
She was a zombie Lizzy!

246
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,556
Thank goodness he was there.

247
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:17,660
The Bingleys have invited me to tea.

248
00:20:18,153 --> 00:20:19,683
Of course they have!

249
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:22,566
What?

250
00:20:23,815 --> 00:20:25,580
Truly, I'd much rather go by coach.

251
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:27,346
You had much better go on horseback.

252
00:20:27,405 --> 00:20:28,900
For it seems likely to rain!

253
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,643
Then you must stay all night!

254
00:20:31,488 --> 00:20:32,780
That would be a good scheme.

255
00:20:33,067 --> 00:20:34,780
If you were sure they would not send her home.

256
00:20:35,008 --> 00:20:36,860
Mother, I really would prefer the carriage.

257
00:20:37,193 --> 00:20:40,375
Jane, Mr. Bingley undoubtedly
likes you but in 9 cases out of 10

258
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:42,700
A woman had far better share
more affection than she feels.

259
00:20:42,827 --> 00:20:43,648
Enough.

260
00:20:44,803 --> 00:20:45,593
Go quickly now.

261
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:47,940
The zombies spring easily from the wet earth.

262
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:26,700
Massive god...

263
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:28,700
this cannot be.

264
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:54,820
Where is she?

265
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:58,660
- She must be closely monitored, and her room locked.
- At all times.

266
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:01,660
Miss Elizabeth Bennet.

267
00:23:04,514 --> 00:23:06,643
Did you walk all the way here?

268
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:07,770
Yes.

269
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:09,707
How's my sister?

270
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:12,041
She was feverish and slept ill last night.

271
00:23:12,361 --> 00:23:13,460
I think she has the flu.

272
00:23:14,337 --> 00:23:14,980
Or worse.

273
00:23:15,446 --> 00:23:16,726
I detest illness.

274
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:19,020
Keeps one in a continual state of inelegance.

275
00:23:19,321 --> 00:23:19,794
Quite.

276
00:23:21,057 --> 00:23:22,285
May I tend to her?

277
00:23:22,313 --> 00:23:24,511
Of course.  Edwin, show Ms. Bennet the way.

278
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:26,330
Thank you.

279
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:31,860
I will not make the same mistake I made
at Mrs. Featherstone's whist party Bingley.

280
00:23:38,706 --> 00:23:40,660
Oh Janey.

281
00:23:43,193 --> 00:23:43,923
Miss Bennet?

282
00:23:46,417 --> 00:23:48,139
The physician has arrived.

283
00:23:49,106 --> 00:23:49,683
Please.

284
00:23:58,608 --> 00:24:00,069
She got caught in the down pour?

285
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:01,259
Yes.

286
00:24:26,946 --> 00:24:28,400
The wound, doctor.

287
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:30,700
Her musket backfired.

288
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:40,820
I see no indication of a bite.

289
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:42,860
That was never in question.

290
00:24:54,438 --> 00:24:56,281
I believe that these belong to you.

291
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:19,860
How is she?

292
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:21,660
She's fast asleep.

293
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:23,820
I'm sure she'll be quite well, please!

294
00:25:24,229 --> 00:25:25,113
Join us, Miss Bennet.

295
00:25:25,262 --> 00:25:27,321
Oh, thank you but I'll amuse myself with a book.

296
00:25:27,415 --> 00:25:29,415
You prefer reading to cards?

297
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:31,735
I prefer a great many things to cards Mr. Hurst.

298
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:41,820
- I don't speak horrible Japanese.
- No, of course.

299
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,820
You didn't train in Japan.

300
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:45,660
China, was it?

301
00:25:45,766 --> 00:25:48,620
A Shaolin Temple in Henan Province.

302
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:51,464
It was there that I learned to
endure all manner of discomfort.

303
00:25:51,502 --> 00:25:54,326
May I inquire as to the
nature of this discomfort?

304
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,709
I would much rather give
you a demonstration.

305
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:02,700
Mr. Darcy.

306
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:05,620
Is your sister much grown since the spring?

307
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:07,780
She's now about the same
height as Ms. Elizabeth Bennet.

308
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:11,370
I don't believe I've ever met
a girl so extremely accomplished.

309
00:26:11,422 --> 00:26:15,780
The word "accomplished" is far too
liberally applied to young ladies today but

310
00:26:16,062 --> 00:26:18,921
my sister Georgiana does
deserve that distinction.

311
00:26:19,565 --> 00:26:22,059
Not only is she a master of the female arts but

312
00:26:22,093 --> 00:26:23,700
Deadly as well.

313
00:26:24,003 --> 00:26:27,140
I cannot boast knowing more half
a dozen in the whole range of my acquaintance

314
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:28,302
that is less accomplished.

315
00:26:28,375 --> 00:26:29,740
Nor I, I'm sure.

316
00:26:30,076 --> 00:26:31,537
And Mr. Darcy.

317
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:35,012
You must comprehend a great deal in
your idea of an accomplished woman?

318
00:26:35,582 --> 00:26:36,160
I do.

319
00:26:36,699 --> 00:26:38,700
A woman must have a thorough knowledge of

320
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:41,544
Music, singing, drawing, dancing

321
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,820
and the modern languages.

322
00:26:43,273 --> 00:26:46,500
She must be well trained in the
fighting styles of the Kyoto masters

323
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,500
and weapons and tactics of modern Europe.

324
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,542
Or the term would only...

325
00:26:50,598 --> 00:26:51,500
Half deserved.

326
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:54,069
And you know six such women?

327
00:26:54,459 --> 00:26:56,066
I wonder now at your knowing any.

328
00:26:56,139 --> 00:26:58,220
Are you so severe on your own sex?

329
00:26:58,316 --> 00:27:00,876
A woman is either highly trained or highly refined.

330
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:04,153
One cannot afford the luxury of both in such times.

331
00:27:08,678 --> 00:27:09,660
Ah..

332
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:11,740
"L'Art De La Guerre"

333
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:13,740
The art of war.

334
00:27:15,749 --> 00:27:17,700
Have you not read it in its original Wu dialect?

335
00:27:21,408 --> 00:27:22,219
Alas.

336
00:27:32,264 --> 00:27:34,620
I should get back to Jane.

337
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:45,819
She is one of those young ladies who seeks

338
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:49,600
to recommend themselves to
men by undervaluing their own sex.

339
00:27:51,471 --> 00:27:52,820
Undoubtedly.

340
00:28:49,293 --> 00:28:54,860
Mrs. Bennet. Miss Bennet, Ms. Bennet.... and Ms. Bennet.

341
00:28:55,419 --> 00:28:57,620
Mrs. Bennet I'm so glad to see you.

342
00:28:57,620 --> 00:29:01,099
On, yeah and sadly on this distressing circumstances.

343
00:29:01,151 --> 00:29:02,780
Are you here to take Jane home?

344
00:29:03,252 --> 00:29:03,660
No.

345
00:29:03,906 --> 00:29:07,426
Yes, we must not trespass
any longer on your kindness.

346
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:10,620
Surely she is too ill to be moved?

347
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:11,989
Truly, she does look very pale.

348
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:12,820
Bingley!

349
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,702
I must protest.

350
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:15,130
Bingley.

351
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:15,533
Please.

352
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,965
Carelessness when dealing with a zombie infection

353
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,300
can lead to your abrupt demise.

354
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:21,109
Arrogance can lead to yours.

355
00:29:21,899 --> 00:29:25,123
Your defect, Ms. Bennet, besides eavesdropping...

356
00:29:25,506 --> 00:29:27,620
is to willfully misunderstand people.

357
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:30,434
And yours is to be unjustly prejudiced against them.

358
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:32,780
Come on, Eliza, come on.

359
00:29:36,619 --> 00:29:41,140
Mr. Bingley, I know just the
thing to break this terrible tension and...

360
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:42,740
and lift the spirits of the county.

361
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:44,940
A ball at Netherfield.

362
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:45,820
Out of the question!

363
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,728
The security risk alone-

364
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,850
It's a brilliant idea.

365
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:52,700
When Janey's recovered, we shall.
If you please name the day.

366
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,045
She'd be honored.

367
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:20,660
Look at her.

368
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:22,780
We could have stayed on for
another week in that palace.

369
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:26,700
I'd risk a cold before I'd risk Darcy's blade.

370
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:33,780
Mrs. Beacham's orphanage fell.

371
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:47,700
There will be an addition to
our party for dinner tonight.

372
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:53,700
It would appear your health is fully restored.

373
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:55,820
Quite recovered, Papa.

374
00:30:56,532 --> 00:30:57,860
I know of no one who is coming.

375
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:03,780
The person of whom I speak, is a certain gentleman.

376
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,493
There he is!

377
00:31:09,756 --> 00:31:10,660
Who is it?

378
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:12,031
This is hurting...

379
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:19,780
He is perusing his future property.

380
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:26,860
This estate must by law go to a male heir.

381
00:31:26,942 --> 00:31:32,140
Now that odious man, Mr. Collins,
may the moment I am dead.

382
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:36,660
Toss you out of this house, at his pleasure.

383
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:41,401
Tell me to which of my fair
cousins do I owe the compliments?

384
00:31:41,586 --> 00:31:44,838
Of the excellent, and I repeat, excellent cooking?

385
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:47,443
My daughters are trained
for battle, sir. Not the kitchen.

386
00:31:48,274 --> 00:31:49,238
Quite, Mr. Bennet.

387
00:31:50,024 --> 00:31:53,620
My patroness is not only
the King's richestsubject

388
00:31:53,662 --> 00:31:57,820
deadliest singularly dedicated
to the annihilation of theundead.

389
00:31:58,097 --> 00:32:02,740
I assume you have all heard
...of Lady Catherine deBourgh.

390
00:32:07,446 --> 00:32:10,347
She's the most deadly swor
dswoman in all of GreatBritain.

391
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:12,027
With the agility of a black panther.

392
00:32:12,128 --> 00:32:14,420
My humble abode but so Lady has stayed.

393
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:15,780
Rosings Park.

394
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:18,320
- Was she ever married?
- Widowed sadly.

395
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:21,874
She has one daughter Anne who is
unfortunately the sickly constitution.

396
00:32:21,975 --> 00:32:25,700
- Had Anne been presented?
- Oh no, no Mrs. Bennet.

397
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,436
Her ill health prevents it.

398
00:32:27,464 --> 00:32:31,603
I told Lady Catherine that the court
has been deprived of its brightest ornament.

399
00:32:32,066 --> 00:32:37,340
I have a talent you see, for delivering these
very delicate compliments with an unstudied air.

400
00:32:37,436 --> 00:32:39,801
It would seem sir, that all you lack now...

401
00:32:40,507 --> 00:32:41,900
is a wife.

402
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:45,700
I must confess Mrs. Bennet.

403
00:32:45,968 --> 00:32:48,980
The fairest wifely choices be in this room.

404
00:32:50,998 --> 00:32:53,982
I declare that I am...

405
00:32:54,253 --> 00:32:56,620
enchanted by your daughter, Jane.

406
00:32:56,740 --> 00:33:00,198
And request to speak to her alone. If I may?

407
00:33:00,438 --> 00:33:01,700
Oh, dear Parson.

408
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:06,620
I'm afraid Jane is already spoken for, we
expect a serious proposal imminently.

409
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:09,596
Oh...fuddle.

410
00:33:09,627 --> 00:33:11,064
But Liz is quite available.

411
00:33:11,189 --> 00:33:13,335
And almost as fair as Jane.

412
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,326
Is there absolutely no negotiation over Jane?

413
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,386
The early bird catches the worm, Mr. Collins.

414
00:33:20,386 --> 00:33:20,900
Oh, indeed.

415
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:24,344
Be mindful of your talent in the delicate compliments, sir.

416
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:29,580
Oh, no! Yea...why yes!
She is...almost-

417
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:31,206
As fair as the other one.

418
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:32,780
Splendid.

419
00:33:33,554 --> 00:33:35,580
Thank you ladies. Settle down.

420
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:39,850
Now I thought I this morning I might
read to you from Fordyce's sermons,

421
00:33:40,006 --> 00:33:41,133
To Young Women.

422
00:33:41,133 --> 00:33:42,940
What a treat, what a treat!

423
00:33:43,283 --> 00:33:45,457
"Chapter One: The Home"

424
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:47,620
We're walking to Meryton to visit Aunt Phillips.

425
00:33:47,645 --> 00:33:50,660
So long as Jane and Lizzy are willing to accompany you.

426
00:33:50,699 --> 00:33:53,660
- We most certainly are.
- And Mr. Collins!

427
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:55,819
- Course?
- Oh, well I shall be delighted-

428
00:33:55,810 --> 00:33:59,740
Only if Mr. Bennet will consent to release me from my reading.

429
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:04,620
- With a heavy heart, sir.
- Mr. Bennet I am susceptible to flattery and you sir...

430
00:34:04,692 --> 00:34:07,433
are very charming. Come along ladies!

431
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:10,340
Miss Elizabeth how charming you look today.

432
00:34:10,483 --> 00:34:13,840
Let us look in the shop windows of Meryton
we can buy some new pots and pans?

433
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:16,340
Take the place of your swords and daggers?

434
00:34:22,017 --> 00:34:24,500
Oh...is there some sort of trouble?

435
00:34:25,412 --> 00:34:26,720
Oh, it appears there is.

436
00:34:31,283 --> 00:34:32,740
Help!

437
00:34:33,603 --> 00:34:36,620
- Penny McGregor's carriage.
- Help!

438
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:39,620
- Someone's trapped inside.
- Jane.

439
00:34:43,457 --> 00:34:48,740
Please help me! Anyone! Hey! Help!

440
00:34:55,801 --> 00:34:57,300
That was a horrible accident.

441
00:34:59,523 --> 00:35:01,092
But I survived!

442
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:02,820
Survived, Jane!

443
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:06,660
Not in the traditional sense of the word.

444
00:35:11,923 --> 00:35:15,820
Appears Ms. McGregor won't be delivering anymore lamp oil.

445
00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:17,871
I must confess.

446
00:35:18,104 --> 00:35:22,006
I was unaware that zombies possessed
the required acuity to set such...

447
00:35:22,608 --> 00:35:23,690
...traps.

448
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:26,841
Before we know it, they'll be running for parliament.

449
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:30,740
Come along.

450
00:35:32,292 --> 00:35:35,822
Fantastic, we must try and make
elevenses actually. Come along, Elizabeth!

451
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:37,780
We mustn't dawdle we can't be late.

452
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:42,700
Ms. Bennet.

453
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:45,700
- Thank you, Mr. Collins.
- Allow me.

454
00:35:47,593 --> 00:35:50,765
Galantry isn't dead. Come, come now we mustn't be late.

455
00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:02,620
This must be the extra military stationed here in Meryton.

456
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:11,620
Leftenant Danny!

457
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:15,780
Who is that with him?

458
00:36:17,495 --> 00:36:20,316
Ms. Lydia Bennet and Ms. Katherine Bennet,
Leftnenant Wickham.

459
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:23,516
He's just been assigned to our Meryton
regiment to deal with the zombie resurgence.

460
00:36:23,547 --> 00:36:26,570
I bet your fearful handsome in your regimens.

461
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:28,700
Kitty! Lydia!

462
00:36:29,641 --> 00:36:31,085
Ms. Jane and Elizabeth Bennet,

463
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,299
- May I introduce-.
- George Wickham.

464
00:36:32,587 --> 00:36:33,224
He's a Leftenant.

465
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:35,780
This is our cousin Mr. Collins.

466
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:37,820
Parson Collins.

467
00:36:39,325 --> 00:36:40,813
Aren't we overdo at the Phillips?

468
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:43,700
Walk us?

469
00:36:43,739 --> 00:36:45,700
I fear I have a prior engagement.

470
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:46,860
Mr. Wickham?

471
00:36:47,231 --> 00:36:48,163
Yes, enchanted!

472
00:36:48,393 --> 00:36:50,860
She is baking, so we mustn't be late.

473
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:53,467
I said she is baking.

474
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:56,340
I was very keen to be on time.

475
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:59,180
But it is apparent that Aunt Phillips
muffins are splendid you see.

476
00:36:59,180 --> 00:36:59,975
Is that so?

477
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:02,940
You know I and Lady
Catherine abhor tardiness

478
00:37:03,408 --> 00:37:06,740
and actually it has instilled me
with a real sense of order.

479
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:08,984
Thank you for accompanying us.

480
00:37:09,043 --> 00:37:10,973
And enduring my younger sisters.

481
00:37:11,627 --> 00:37:12,713
It's my pleasure.

482
00:37:14,048 --> 00:37:16,250
Are you going to be stationed
here all winter, Mr. Wickham?

483
00:37:16,525 --> 00:37:19,700
Well that depends entirely what the
enemies have in store for us, Ms. Bennet.

484
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:24,700
Mr. Bingley!

485
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:29,620
We were just on our way
to Longbourn!

486
00:37:29,704 --> 00:37:32,740
Mr. Bingley you promised you'd throw
a ball at Netherfield.

487
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:36,780
- You're quite recovered.
- She is.

488
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:39,217
Then I shall begin preparations
immediately the most

489
00:37:39,210 --> 00:37:41,920
glorious ball Hertfordshire has seen.

490
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:44,740
Can Leftenant Wickham come?

491
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:47,980
Of course.

492
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:51,780
An invitation shall sent to all
my fellow officers.

493
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:55,600
Excuse me.

494
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:00,580
Good day, Jane.

495
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:03,986
There you are my beautiful nieces!

496
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:09,540
Please join us Mr. Wickham.

497
00:38:09,648 --> 00:38:11,095
No, duty calls I'm afraid.

498
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:15,820
I must know Mr. Wickham.

499
00:38:17,161 --> 00:38:19,740
What is amiss between you and Mr. Darcy?

500
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:23,780
Are you much acquainted with him?

501
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:25,740
More than I wish to be.

502
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:29,700
He's been here for less than a month
and already the least popular man in the county.

503
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:32,700
Yes it always gives me
great pain to see him.

504
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:34,780
I've been connected to his family
since infancy.

505
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:39,820
My father managed the late Mr. Darcy's estate
Darcy and I grew up together.

506
00:38:40,410 --> 00:38:42,111
His father treated me like a second son.

507
00:38:42,288 --> 00:38:44,427
I cannot begin to do justice to his kindness.

508
00:38:44,991 --> 00:38:46,940
He bequeathed me with the best living and his gift.

509
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,158
I had my heart set on joining the church.

510
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:51,700
But when he was slain in the 2nd battle of Kent,

511
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:54,620
Darcy ignored his wishes and
gave my living to another man.

512
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:58,580
What could've induced him to pay
you so cruelly?

513
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:00,820
Pride.

514
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:03,620
He thought me too low to be
worth his consideration.

515
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:07,057
I loved his father dearly so I can
never expose Darcy or challenge him to a duel.

516
00:39:07,126 --> 00:39:08,740
Come now, Lizzy.

517
00:39:09,106 --> 00:39:11,179
We must plan our trip to the North Gantry.

518
00:39:11,206 --> 00:39:12,518
I'll be right there.

519
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:16,420
Well perhaps I shall see
you at Mr. Bingley's Ball.

520
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:18,615
Perhaps.

521
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:23,168
I'll be there.

522
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:50,700
Mr. Wickham.

523
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:52,780
- You came.
- As I said I would.

524
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:55,740
I oughta think that Mr. Darcy's
presence would keep you away.

525
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:58,580
If Mr. Darcy wishes to avoid me
he must go, not I.

526
00:40:59,606 --> 00:41:01,366
I have found you Ms. Bennet.

527
00:41:03,509 --> 00:41:05,081
Sorry, and you are?

528
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:06,180
- Wickham.
- Oh, Tuan Wickham. Aku ingat.

529
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:08,956
Oh! Mr. Wickham I never...

530
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:11,700
...forget a face, especially one as angelic as Ms. Bennet's

531
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:13,660
I do hope you haven't forgotten our dance?

532
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:15,780
Of course not, Parson Collins.

533
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:17,580
Oh, allow me.

534
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:18,650
Thank you, Mr. Wickham.

535
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:22,780
Lady Catherine herself has praised
me on my lightness of foot.

536
00:41:24,210 --> 00:41:27,366
Wonders to how you found the time
to hone such delicacy in your step.

537
00:41:27,422 --> 00:41:29,659
Flattery will get you everywhere, Ms. Bennet.

538
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:30,820
Yeah.

539
00:41:31,330 --> 00:41:32,643
The dance seems to be getting away with us.

540
00:41:32,685 --> 00:41:34,980
I think it only right and proper that every clergymen

541
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:37,410
should set the example for matrimony in the parish.

542
00:41:42,379 --> 00:41:44,149
This is my favorite moment in the dance!

543
00:41:44,292 --> 00:41:46,660
The non partisan full swing!

544
00:41:48,306 --> 00:41:49,780
Such splendor in the air!

545
00:41:53,596 --> 00:41:56,620
Mr. Collins please keep your voice down.

546
00:41:58,994 --> 00:42:01,780
Splendid, splendid work everyone!

547
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:03,740
Thank you for your attention.

548
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:05,266
Everyone did valiantly.

549
00:42:05,293 --> 00:42:09,860
Ms. Bennet it is my intention to remain very
close to you throughout all the evening.

550
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:13,620
- May I have the next dance?
- Yes!

551
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:22,177
Mr. Darcy this is Mr. Collins.

552
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:24,149
- Parson Collins.
- Parson Collins.

553
00:42:25,596 --> 00:42:26,400
Your?

554
00:42:27,881 --> 00:42:29,057
Perhaps my cousin.

555
00:42:29,638 --> 00:42:33,523
Mr. Darcy I have made the
most incredible discovery

556
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:37,092
No, tush—An extraordinary discovery sir.

557
00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:41,740
You are the nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh.

558
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:44,448
I know.

559
00:42:46,153 --> 00:42:47,620
Well, I know you know.

560
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:50,173
- And I'm here to do the honor of introducing myself-
- Please. excuse me.

561
00:42:50,246 --> 00:42:53,986
-am Parson Collins—my humble abode

562
00:42:54,083 --> 00:42:58,780
I predict a wedding in under 3 months.

563
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:01,820
Such a charming young man!

564
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:03,547
He's so-

565
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:06,660
well rich!

566
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:10,620
Jane marrying Bingley is bound to
throw her sisters in the way of others.

567
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:12,090
Rich men, and then-!

568
00:43:12,191 --> 00:43:14,820
Mother, it's time to go!

569
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:18,620
Don't be so impertinent!

570
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:20,107
Mr. Darcy overheard you.

571
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:22,914
Who is Mr. Darcy to me pray
that I should be afraid of him?

572
00:43:22,914 --> 00:43:24,860
I can't find Papa or Lydia anywhere!

573
00:43:25,026 --> 00:43:28,100
Papa will be in the library and I'll find that stupid girl!

574
00:43:33,443 --> 00:43:35,513
Edwin, where is dessert?

575
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:40,660
Sir?

576
00:43:43,488 --> 00:43:46,660
- We must find Darcy immediately
- There's no time.

577
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:50,700
Mr. Bingley.

578
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:52,900
Yes.

579
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:13,860
Bingley?

580
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:26,780
- Your Ms. Beacham's servants.
- We were Ms. Bennet.

581
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:28,660
How did you get in here?

582
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:31,820
Our new friend showed us the way in!

583
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:43,860
Mr. Darcy!

584
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:04,820
Was he bitten?

585
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:09,820
- Was he bitten?!
- No!

586
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:12,740
No, he fell and hit his head!

587
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:17,820
Bingley?

588
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:32,660
Your ability as a warrior are beyond reproach Mr. Darcy.

589
00:45:32,750 --> 00:45:34,309
If only you were as good a friend.

590
00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:01,740
Dear Jane, we've decided to close
down Netherfield and return to London.

591
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:03,740
We're not sure when we shall return.

592
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:06,740
The Bingley's just closed down the house and left?

593
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:08,660
I don't understand.

594
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:10,380
Why would he not know when he is to return?

595
00:46:10,525 --> 00:46:14,740
According to Caroline Bingley,
Mr. Darcy is impatient to see his sister.

596
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:16,780
My brother admires her greatly already.

597
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:20,700
Who will now be seeing her frequently and on the most intimate footing.

598
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:22,118
Am I wrong my dearest Jane,

599
00:46:22,125 --> 00:46:25,660
in indulging the hope of an event which
will secure the happiness of so many.

600
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:27,820
Obviously she knows her
brother is in love with you

601
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:30,820
And wants him to marry Ms. Darcy.

602
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:35,980
If Mr. Bingley truly loves me,
nothing can keep us apart.

603
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:40,700
No one who has ever seen you
together can doubt his affection.

604
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:45,740
I'm sure Mr. Bingley will be back soon.

605
00:46:45,860 --> 00:46:48,024
And that there's a good reason for all this.

606
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:57,820
Ladies. Good morrow.

607
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:23,700
Mr. Collins would like a private
audience with your sister.

608
00:47:38,368 --> 00:47:39,151
Miss Elizabeth...

609
00:47:39,443 --> 00:47:43,307
As soon as I entered the house I singled
you out as the companion for my future life.

610
00:47:43,492 --> 00:47:44,125
Oh, no!

611
00:47:44,299 --> 00:47:48,539
I am convinced marrying you will
add very greatly to my happiness.

612
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:50,876
But actually I must add-

613
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:54,313
I will of course require you to retire your warrior skills

614
00:47:54,310 --> 00:47:56,438
as part of the marital submission.

615
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,740
We absolutely can't have
swords in the home.

616
00:47:58,860 --> 00:48:00,740
But now, Miss Elizabeth.

617
00:48:01,020 --> 00:48:03,380
But allow me to assure you in
the most animated language

618
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:06,620
of the violence—the sheer violence of my affection.

619
00:48:06,667 --> 00:48:08,820
Sir, I'm honored by your proposal.

620
00:48:08,852 --> 00:48:09,756
- Thank you.
- I am.

621
00:48:10,629 --> 00:48:12,300
But I regret I must refuse.

622
00:48:13,575 --> 00:48:16,852
Lizzy, I insist you marry Mr. Collins!

623
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:20,358
Do not worry Mr. Collins she shall be brought to reason

624
00:48:20,393 --> 00:48:20,928
Oh good!

625
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:21,266
No.

626
00:48:21,516 --> 00:48:22,358
Oh, no...

627
00:48:22,570 --> 00:48:23,467
I'm terribly sorry.

628
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:41,820
Lizzy, Lizzy.

629
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:45,580
You will marry Mr. Collins or
I shall never speak to you again!

630
00:48:47,547 --> 00:48:48,994
You talk to her.

631
00:48:50,034 --> 00:48:50,643
Lizzy!

632
00:48:51,606 --> 00:48:53,958
An unhappy alternative is before you.

633
00:48:54,535 --> 00:48:57,725
Your mother will never speak to
you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins.

634
00:48:58,820 --> 00:49:01,582
And I will never speak
to you again if you do.

635
00:49:07,683 --> 00:49:10,125
Who will maintain you when your father is dead?

636
00:49:10,264 --> 00:49:15,206
No one! Elizabeth Bennet. You shall
become a poor and pathetic spinster!

637
00:49:15,297 --> 00:49:19,700
Anything! Anything is to be preferred or endured

638
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:22,740
rather than marrying without affection!

639
00:49:25,669 --> 00:49:28,700
Lizzy don't go into the woods alone!

640
00:49:29,088 --> 00:49:30,434
Lizzy!

641
00:49:30,490 --> 00:49:33,700
I forbid you!

642
00:49:54,980 --> 00:49:56,820
Elizabeth?

643
00:49:57,980 --> 00:49:59,860
Mr. Wickham?

644
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,740
You vanished at the Ball.

645
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:11,740
Yes. I thought it would be selfish of me
to seek an encounter with Mr. Darcy.

646
00:50:12,114 --> 00:50:13,740
Would've ruined the Ball for
anyone who witnessed it.

647
00:50:13,979 --> 00:50:16,633
I am very sorry I lost the pleasure of dancing with you though.

648
00:50:17,753 --> 00:50:20,813
Did you happen to see four gentlemen pass this way?

649
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:22,820
In top hats?

650
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:23,857
You saw them?

651
00:50:23,850 --> 00:50:24,483
No.

652
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:26,980
But they were undoubtedly Pall Bearers.

653
00:50:27,346 --> 00:50:28,860
This is a cemetery.

654
00:50:30,347 --> 00:50:31,405
Oh, Ms. Bennet?

655
00:50:33,384 --> 00:50:35,900
I want to take you somewhere very special to me.

656
00:50:36,299 --> 00:50:39,620
It's a secret place I've never shown another living soul.

657
00:50:41,485 --> 00:50:45,283
I stumbled upon it by accident when
I was first stationed in the "inbetween"

658
00:50:45,683 --> 00:50:49,311
But somehow I believe I was
always destined to find it, Ms. Bennet.

659
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:15,620
You go in. I'll join you after I seat my horse.

660
00:51:19,464 --> 00:51:20,330
Don't be afraid.

661
00:51:22,636 --> 00:51:23,245
I'm not.

662
00:51:53,516 --> 00:51:54,695
You're quite rude!

663
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:04,431
It's alright.

664
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:10,660
"Happy are those who are called to his supper."

665
00:52:15,820 --> 00:52:18,500
The locusts have no king.

666
00:52:18,820 --> 00:52:23,460
Yet all of them go forth marching anywhere.

667
00:52:29,579 --> 00:52:32,620
- Brains.
- No, they are pig's brains.

668
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:34,540
You have nothing to fear.

669
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:39,500
You see if they never consume human brains
they will never fully transform into zombies.

670
00:52:39,820 --> 00:52:43,000
St. Lazarus' is the key to find the ending the
struggle between the living and the undead.

671
00:52:43,405 --> 00:52:47,420
We must force some kind of understanding
with the most advanced among them.

672
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:50,380
Surely the crown will support such a venture.

673
00:52:50,445 --> 00:52:52,580
The war has almost bankrupted Great Britain.

674
00:52:53,172 --> 00:52:53,909
I don't know where to turn.

675
00:52:55,860 --> 00:52:58,540
It's only a matter of time before
they outnumber us.

676
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:14,500
- Liz.
- Charlotte?

677
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:16,500
I didn't know you were coming to visit.

678
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:19,540
I have some news.

679
00:53:20,333 --> 00:53:23,460
I'm engaged to be married to Mr. Collins.

680
00:53:27,196 --> 00:53:28,500
You must be surprised.

681
00:53:28,820 --> 00:53:30,500
I'm not, I'm relieved.

682
00:53:30,860 --> 00:53:35,500
I believe my chances of happiness with him
is as fair as most women can hope for.

683
00:53:36,940 --> 00:53:39,380
And that's what you expect?

684
00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:42,500
Twenty five is more than I expect.

685
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:49,500
Charlotte, if you're happy for you,

686
00:53:49,820 --> 00:53:51,700
then I am too.

687
00:53:54,740 --> 00:53:57,540
But I am to be presented to Lady Catherine and

688
00:53:57,860 --> 00:54:02,660
if I'm to stay the night at Mr. Collin's
rectory I will require a chaperone.

689
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:05,860
- Charlotte.
- She is said to be quite imposing

690
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:09,420
and the thought of facing her without
you makes me deathly nervous so.

691
00:54:09,707 --> 00:54:10,608
Please?

692
00:54:16,643 --> 00:54:17,506
I'll come.

693
00:54:19,735 --> 00:54:22,540
- But I have one stipulation.
- Anything.

694
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:26,180
Now when we meet Lady Catherine,
a simply curtsy will suffice.

695
00:54:26,222 --> 00:54:29,660
Maintain eye contact but don't
speak unless spoken to please.

696
00:54:31,820 --> 00:54:33,916
Lady Catherine's favorite Black Guard.

697
00:54:34,424 --> 00:54:35,940
They can't move.

698
00:54:37,085 --> 00:54:39,005
Look at this you can tickle him with a feather.

699
00:54:41,509 --> 00:54:44,460
An extraordinary sight is it not?

700
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:49,660
Oh, such splendor!

701
00:54:53,210 --> 00:54:58,500
Lady Catherine's "Smiting the Undead" which is so majestic.

702
00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:02,991
Elizabeth Bennet.

703
00:55:07,860 --> 00:55:09,940
The Four Horsemen of the Zombie Apocalypse.

704
00:55:10,288 --> 00:55:12,806
When they're there, the end of days is nigh.

705
00:55:13,074 --> 00:55:14,608
This way, please.

706
00:55:18,636 --> 00:55:23,420
Parson Collins. Ms. Lucas and Ms. Bennet.

707
00:55:28,860 --> 00:55:30,540
Lady Catherine?

708
00:55:31,471 --> 00:55:32,434
Miss de Bourgh?

709
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:35,460
Lady Catherine.

710
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:37,620
So you are Elizabeth Bennet.

711
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:40,006
Yes, I am your ladyship.

712
00:55:43,262 --> 00:55:44,730
This is my daughter.

713
00:55:49,064 --> 00:55:53,460
Well it's very kind of you to invite us
over for tea Lady Catherine, really.

714
00:55:53,725 --> 00:55:55,500
Very grateful.

715
00:55:56,619 --> 00:55:58,420
Mr. Darcy?

716
00:55:58,940 --> 00:56:00,660
Ms. Bennet.

717
00:56:00,980 --> 00:56:03,460
You know my nephew?

718
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:07,460
Yes I had the tremendous pleasure
of meeting him in Hertfordshire.

719
00:56:07,655 --> 00:56:08,540
Mr. Wickham.

720
00:56:09,307 --> 00:56:10,942
Is this the soldier you spoke of?

721
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:14,608
Yes, Ms. Bennet requested he attend that
he might confer with your ladyship

722
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:17,050
about a strategy with which to combat the scourge.

723
00:56:17,206 --> 00:56:19,920
A Leftenant? Really?

724
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:22,973
And tea is brought up.

725
00:56:23,029 --> 00:56:24,386
Shall we?

726
00:56:24,386 --> 00:56:25,700
Delighted to.

727
00:56:25,980 --> 00:56:27,380
Please.

728
00:56:27,860 --> 00:56:31,380
I have given you entrance to the
wealthiest woman in the kingdom.

729
00:56:31,860 --> 00:56:33,620
The rest is up to you.

730
00:56:36,086 --> 00:56:37,763
Your ladyship has perhaps heard

731
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:40,267
some of the stricken have not succumbed
to the urge to feed upon the living.

732
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:42,460
And in so doing have maintained their human ways.

733
00:56:42,793 --> 00:56:45,993
And they've managed to resist this
most primal of zombie urges how?

734
00:56:46,062 --> 00:56:47,766
Their ironclad constitutions?

735
00:56:49,613 --> 00:56:52,420
Yes, fortified by religious piety and pig's brains.

736
00:56:52,633 --> 00:56:54,540
Which they receive in communion as the blood of Christ.

737
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:57,144
The pig's brains quench their apetite for human brains.

738
00:56:57,276 --> 00:56:58,900
Ah, yes of course.

739
00:56:58,987 --> 00:57:00,535
The crown's funds have been drained.

740
00:57:00,530 --> 00:57:02,173
You are here to solicit money?

741
00:57:02,702 --> 00:57:04,940
I'm here to propose a venture
that would end the war forever.

742
00:57:04,940 --> 00:57:07,540
These new zombies can be reasoned with.

743
00:57:07,860 --> 00:57:10,396
With the proper funding I believe
we can cultivate trust

744
00:57:10,390 --> 00:57:12,827
and even good will with this new iteration of undead.

745
00:57:12,860 --> 00:57:16,660
Who seem to possess an inherent
power over the lower ranks of their kind.

746
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:21,248
Zombie aristocrats?

747
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:29,660
I prefer to think of them
as souls lost in purgatory.

748
00:57:30,243 --> 00:57:31,986
The common hordes look to them for leadership.

749
00:57:32,177 --> 00:57:35,443
It takes just one of them to realize their
power and to lead their hordes into battle-

750
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:36,695
The undead are like locusts.

751
00:57:36,690 --> 00:57:37,290
Locusts.

752
00:57:37,290 --> 00:57:38,580
They go forth and destroy.

753
00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:41,420
They have no use for leaders.

754
00:57:41,499 --> 00:57:43,450
Oh, except one actually.

755
00:57:45,363 --> 00:57:48,460
According to the Book of Revelation actually

756
00:57:48,460 --> 00:57:50,817
the anti-christ shall lead the undead.

757
00:57:51,020 --> 00:57:56,420
On the day that shall be the last day of mankind.

758
00:57:56,580 --> 00:57:57,408
How cheery Collins.

759
00:57:57,485 --> 00:58:00,845
Thank you Lady Catherine, Franklin
are there more scones?

760
00:58:00,940 --> 00:58:04,420
- If we can negotiate with a select group of...
- Aristocrats?

761
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:06,420
- To what end?
- A treaty.

762
00:58:06,660 --> 00:58:07,780
Appeasement?

763
00:58:08,629 --> 00:58:09,283
Never.

764
00:58:09,283 --> 00:58:11,280
Well then the human race is surely doomed.

765
00:58:13,140 --> 00:58:17,020
Your ladyship the undead will always
multiply faster than the living and procreate.

766
00:58:17,234 --> 00:58:19,660
Nine months to make a baby then 16 years

767
00:58:19,660 --> 00:58:22,460
to make a soldier and one
raw second to make a zombie.

768
00:58:22,747 --> 00:58:25,460
You must realize if they were to
organize we cannot defeat them.

769
00:58:25,697 --> 00:58:28,060
The only hope is to find a way to coexist with them.

770
00:58:28,535 --> 00:58:30,417
Before they find their anti-christ.

771
00:58:33,492 --> 00:58:35,697
The late Mr. Darcy would have
supported such a venture.

772
00:58:37,328 --> 00:58:40,420
I have tolerated your presence
here long enough, Wickham.

773
00:58:40,566 --> 00:58:41,391
Guards!

774
00:58:48,121 --> 00:58:50,460
Please do remember this moment.

775
00:58:50,820 --> 00:58:53,500
And the opportunity you so glibly spurned.

776
00:58:53,820 --> 00:58:55,540
The day of the zombie is already brokered.

777
00:58:55,958 --> 00:58:58,660
Wake and face the light or slumber into oblivion.

778
00:59:10,434 --> 00:59:14,660
Mr. Darcy, you are as unfeeling
as the undead.

779
00:59:20,820 --> 00:59:26,460
My word. You give your opinion
very decidedly for so young a person.

780
00:59:26,780 --> 00:59:28,358
Indeed Lady Catherine.

781
00:59:28,368 --> 00:59:31,700
Well I would like to say how dutifully behaved
I think Lady Anne has been this morning.

782
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:34,660
A real credit to the crest actually.

783
00:59:35,860 --> 00:59:37,660
Would you like a scone, dear?

784
01:00:38,900 --> 01:00:40,660
I didn't mean to frighten you.

785
01:00:41,721 --> 01:00:42,431
You didn't.

786
01:00:43,020 --> 01:00:44,540
No, of course not.

787
01:00:44,860 --> 01:00:47,620
Rosings is the safest place in England.

788
01:00:48,483 --> 01:00:49,993
You see that's the problem.

789
01:00:50,860 --> 01:00:54,460
I wish those feel invincible within their
great houses but how wrong they are.

790
01:00:55,286 --> 01:00:56,820
Their hubris will be their downfall.

791
01:00:57,820 --> 01:00:59,580
Downfall?

792
01:01:00,382 --> 01:01:02,860
You act as if the undead have already defeated us.

793
01:01:05,820 --> 01:01:07,627
I think you and I understand each other Elizabeth.

794
01:01:11,669 --> 01:01:13,283
By the way you championed
me earlier, I thought.

795
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:16,299
Mr. Darcy's treatment of you
has been utterly despicable.

796
01:01:16,368 --> 01:01:18,918
No more despicable than his
treatment of you and your family.

797
01:01:18,980 --> 01:01:22,420
I don't understand you sir.

798
01:01:23,631 --> 01:01:26,960
It was Darcy that persuaded Bingley to stay
clear of your sister and leave Netherfield.

799
01:01:28,740 --> 01:01:29,620
Why?

800
01:01:29,980 --> 01:01:33,660
Because he believe your
sister to be inferior to his friend.

801
01:01:34,215 --> 01:01:38,500
Darcy also convinced Bingley that she was
after his fortune and doesn't really love him.

802
01:01:38,860 --> 01:01:40,620
How could you possibly know this?

803
01:01:40,940 --> 01:01:42,580
Men talk.

804
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:44,904
Darcy brags about it with his intimates.

805
01:01:47,860 --> 01:01:50,540
Ms. Bennet, run away with me.

806
01:01:54,382 --> 01:01:55,951
You have crossed a line, sir.

807
01:01:57,860 --> 01:02:00,580
We're far beyond lines now, Ms. Bennet.

808
01:02:04,758 --> 01:02:08,660
Take you to the pasture Ms. Bennet—day of reckoning is upon us.

809
01:02:40,940 --> 01:02:42,540
Charlotte?

810
01:02:43,900 --> 01:02:45,460
Charlotte?

811
01:03:10,940 --> 01:03:13,460
- Mr. Darcy.
- Ms. Bennet.

812
01:03:13,780 --> 01:03:16,653
You've finally arisen. How fortuitous.

813
01:03:19,780 --> 01:03:23,380
There are some words, I must say.

814
01:03:24,448 --> 01:03:25,707
Please do be seated.

815
01:03:33,820 --> 01:03:37,420
Ms. Bennet although I know many
consider you to be decidedly inferior.

816
01:03:37,568 --> 01:03:41,660
As a matter of your birth, family and circumstances.

817
01:03:42,354 --> 01:03:46,620
My feelings will not be repressed.
In vein, I struggled.

818
01:03:47,860 --> 01:03:50,146
I've come to feel for you a most ardent

819
01:03:50,140 --> 01:03:54,370
admiration and regard which
has overcome my better judgment.

820
01:03:56,483 --> 01:04:01,328
So now I ask you most fervently to
end my turmoil and consent to be my wife.

821
01:04:06,490 --> 01:04:09,290
If I could feel gratitude I would now thank you.

822
01:04:10,860 --> 01:04:12,460
But I cannot.

823
01:04:12,820 --> 01:04:18,460
I never desired your good opinion.
And you've certainly bestowed it most unwillingly.

824
01:04:29,860 --> 01:04:31,580
Might I be informed why?

825
01:04:32,278 --> 01:04:35,300
With so little endeavored civility I am rejected.

826
01:04:35,683 --> 01:04:39,005
You intentionally ruined the
happiness of my most beloved sister.

827
01:04:40,780 --> 01:04:43,500
- Do you deny it?
- I have no wish to deny it.

828
01:04:44,514 --> 01:04:48,382
I did everything in my power to
separate my friend from your sister.

829
01:04:53,276 --> 01:04:54,500
How could you?

830
01:04:55,022 --> 01:04:58,834
(inaudible)

831
01:04:59,172 --> 01:05:04,540
- I believed her to be indifferent.
- Indifferent? She's shy!

832
01:05:11,373 --> 01:05:16,500
Did you suggest to Mr. Bingley that his
fortune had some bearing on the matter.

833
01:05:16,860 --> 01:05:20,460
I wouldn't do your sister the dishonor
though it was suggested.

834
01:05:24,194 --> 01:05:27,180
- By Ms. Bingley?!
- By your mother at the Ball.

835
01:05:31,340 --> 01:05:35,026
Your character was reprehensible

836
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:39,777
What I don't understand his misfortunes are your hand.

837
01:05:39,794 --> 01:05:42,212
Mr. Wickham's misfortunes
have been very great indeed.

838
01:05:52,758 --> 01:05:56,086
You withheld the advantages that
you know would defriend him.**

839
01:05:59,940 --> 01:06:01,420
Is this your opinion of me?

840
01:06:01,690 --> 01:06:03,660
Then I thank you for explaining it so fully.

841
01:06:18,380 --> 01:06:20,306
You could not have made the offer of your hand

842
01:06:20,300 --> 01:06:24,460
in any possible way that would've tempted me to accept it.

843
01:06:24,483 --> 01:06:26,473
I have not known you a month.

844
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:32,420
Before I thought you were the last man in the
world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.

845
01:06:36,326 --> 01:06:38,460
You've said quite enough madam.

846
01:06:39,490 --> 01:06:40,886
I fully comprehend your feelings

847
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:43,092
now have only to be ashamed of what may happen.

848
01:06:48,970 --> 01:06:52,584
Please forgive me. And accept my best
wishes for your health and happiness.

849
01:07:12,780 --> 01:07:14,420
Heavens.

850
01:07:14,860 --> 01:07:16,620
What happened, Lizzy?

851
01:07:16,940 --> 01:07:17,864
This is an antique.

852
01:07:20,980 --> 01:07:22,620
- Mr. Darcy

853
01:07:23,179 --> 01:07:25,660
Mr. Darcy came out of the cottage?

854
01:07:29,565 --> 01:07:31,565
This will need clearing up, Elizabeth.

855
01:08:00,556 --> 01:08:02,580
Dear Miss Elizabeth Bennet,

856
01:08:03,860 --> 01:08:07,580
I'm not writing to renew the sentiments
that were so disgusting to you.

857
01:08:07,900 --> 01:08:11,420
But to address the 2 offenses you accuse me of.

858
01:08:11,740 --> 01:08:14,460
I did not intentionally wound your sister.

859
01:08:14,780 --> 01:08:18,540
It was a most unfortunate consequence
of protecting my dearest friend.

860
01:08:18,900 --> 01:08:21,140
Mr. Bingley's feelings for Ms. Bennet

861
01:08:21,140 --> 01:08:23,460
were beyond any I had ever witnessed in him.

862
01:08:23,820 --> 01:08:26,620
Or indeed even thought incapable.

863
01:08:26,980 --> 01:08:30,810
The evening of the dance at Netherfield,
after overhearing your mother

864
01:08:30,810 --> 01:08:34,540
coldly stating her intention of having
all her daughters marry favorably

865
01:08:34,860 --> 01:08:37,540
I persuaded Bingley of the unfitness of the match.

866
01:08:37,900 --> 01:08:41,620
If I have wounded Ms. Bennet's feelings
it was unknowingly done.

867
01:08:41,980 --> 01:08:45,620
As to your other accusation of
having injured Mr. Wickham.

868
01:08:46,320 --> 01:08:49,106
No sooner had my father made clear his intention

869
01:08:49,100 --> 01:08:51,420
to leave Mr. Wickham a handsome sum.

870
01:08:51,464 --> 01:08:55,580
That Mr. Darcy was mysteriously infected by the plague.

871
01:08:56,220 --> 01:09:00,580
It was left to me his son,
to provide a merciful ending.

872
01:09:07,020 --> 01:09:10,620
Still I gave Wickham the
inheritance my father left.

873
01:09:10,900 --> 01:09:12,580
Wickham squandered it.

874
01:09:13,220 --> 01:09:15,620
Where upon he demanded more and more money.

875
01:09:15,980 --> 01:09:18,460
Until I eventually refused.

876
01:09:18,740 --> 01:09:21,154
Thereafter he severed all ties with me.

877
01:09:21,554 --> 01:09:25,460
Last summer he began a relation-
ship with my 15 year old sister.

878
01:09:25,693 --> 01:09:27,580
And convinced her to elope.

879
01:09:28,180 --> 01:09:32,380
Mr. Wickham's prime target was her inheritance of 30,000 pounds.

880
01:09:32,608 --> 01:09:36,337
But revenging himself on me was
a strong additional inducement.

881
01:09:36,860 --> 01:09:42,580
Fortunately I was able to persuade my sister of
Mr. Wickham's ulterior motives before it was too late.

882
01:09:43,113 --> 01:09:48,460
I hope this helps explain and perhaps mitigate my behavior in your eyes.

883
01:09:48,820 --> 01:09:53,540
Of all weapons in the world,
I now know love to be the most dangerous.

884
01:09:53,900 --> 01:09:56,420
For I have suffered a mortal wound.

885
01:09:56,532 --> 01:09:59,660
When did I fall so deeply under your spell, Ms. Bennet?

886
01:10:00,413 --> 01:10:04,789
I cannot fix the hour or the spot or the look
or the words which lay the foundation.

887
01:10:05,150 --> 01:10:08,139
I was in the middle before I knew I began.

888
01:10:08,382 --> 01:10:10,540
But a proud fool I was.

889
01:10:10,860 --> 01:10:12,380
I have faced the harsh truth.

890
01:10:12,643 --> 01:10:15,500
That I can never hope to win your love in this life.

891
01:10:15,820 --> 01:10:18,620
And so I sought solace in combat.

892
01:10:18,900 --> 01:10:22,540
I write to you from the siege of London.

893
01:10:22,940 --> 01:10:25,660
There is now a coming designed zombie attack.

894
01:10:25,980 --> 01:10:27,972
I sense a dark hand is at work.

895
01:10:28,017 --> 01:10:29,660
They are guiding the enemy Ms. Bennet.

896
01:10:30,222 --> 01:10:33,700
By taking London they've increased
their ranks a hundred fold.

897
01:10:36,820 --> 01:10:40,380
Now we endeavor to keep them
trapped within the great wall.

898
01:10:41,860 --> 01:10:44,500
This isn't the random act of some mindless horde.

899
01:10:44,786 --> 01:10:46,681
They struck the palace and both houses.

900
01:10:48,121 --> 01:10:50,660
They cut off our head before we could cut off theirs.

901
01:10:55,020 --> 01:10:58,420
If we should fail to contain them
and they breach Hingham Bridge,

902
01:10:58,573 --> 01:11:02,354
It'll be as if a great dam has broken
and they'll reach out for us swiftly.

903
01:11:03,980 --> 01:11:07,500
And in overwhelming numbers.

904
01:11:07,940 --> 01:11:09,420
Dear Ms. Bennet.

905
01:11:09,780 --> 01:11:12,500
I implore you to be ready.

906
01:11:18,860 --> 01:11:21,460
- Liz!
- Jane.

907
01:11:22,900 --> 01:11:23,660
Jane,

908
01:11:24,424 --> 01:11:25,516
Jane what is it?

909
01:11:25,700 --> 01:11:27,420
Wickham's run off with Lydia.

910
01:11:27,740 --> 01:11:29,540
She's barely more than a child.

911
01:11:29,900 --> 01:11:32,460
I never could have imagined
my own face so improper.

912
01:11:32,740 --> 01:11:34,580
To be such a flaggard.

913
01:11:36,441 --> 01:11:37,516
What are we to do?

914
01:11:44,820 --> 01:11:47,380
These letters.

915
01:11:48,940 --> 01:11:51,380
I know where she is.

916
01:12:03,940 --> 01:12:05,580
You have very small estate.

917
01:12:05,900 --> 01:12:08,500
And yet we endure it.

918
01:12:09,575 --> 01:12:11,986
I have urgent business to attend to.

919
01:12:13,085 --> 01:12:16,069
A falsehood of the most scandalous
nature has reached me.

920
01:12:16,685 --> 01:12:19,833
That you intend to unite with
my own nephew Mr. Darcy.

921
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:21,067
Is this true?

922
01:12:21,533 --> 01:12:23,659
I do not possess your frankness your ladyship.

923
01:12:23,860 --> 01:12:26,041
You may ask questions I may
not choose to answer.

924
01:12:26,093 --> 01:12:27,700
Let me be rightly understood Ms. Bennet.

925
01:12:28,288 --> 01:12:30,820
Darcy has been promised
since infancy to my daughter.

926
01:12:32,820 --> 01:12:36,104
You have no reason to
suppose he made me an offer.

927
01:12:36,170 --> 01:12:38,500
Are you engaged to him or not?

928
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:41,140
Not.

929
01:12:43,377 --> 01:12:44,900
Will you promise me

930
01:12:45,286 --> 01:12:47,909
never to enter into social engagement?

931
01:12:48,166 --> 01:12:50,184
I will make no such promise.

932
01:12:50,900 --> 01:12:53,700
And I shall protect the
dignity of a far superior man.

933
01:12:57,140 --> 01:12:58,620
You doth face me in combat.

934
01:12:59,227 --> 01:13:00,340
I do not.

935
01:13:00,820 --> 01:13:02,921
For to take arms against you my lady,

936
01:13:02,984 --> 01:13:04,775
would be to take arms against England.

937
01:13:06,935 --> 01:13:08,448
My proxy will have to suffice.

938
01:13:08,740 --> 01:13:09,325
Wilhelm.

939
01:13:16,900 --> 01:13:18,660
Bennet.

940
01:13:18,980 --> 01:13:21,420
Do you concede?

941
01:13:21,740 --> 01:13:22,660
I do not.

942
01:13:23,530 --> 01:13:27,420
My courage always rises at
every attempt to intimidate me.

943
01:13:57,860 --> 01:14:00,580
Do you still refuse to oblige me?

944
01:14:01,290 --> 01:14:04,460
I do!

945
01:14:29,325 --> 01:14:32,700
I do not know which I admire more Ms. Bennet..

946
01:14:33,464 --> 01:14:35,580
Your skill as a warrior,

947
01:14:36,354 --> 01:14:38,660
or your resolve as a woman.

948
01:14:45,940 --> 01:14:47,420
Tunggu, ayah..

949
01:14:47,740 --> 01:14:50,220
What's right to do cannot be done too soon.

950
01:14:50,469 --> 01:14:52,420
You don't even know where she is!

951
01:14:52,643 --> 01:14:55,099
I do I promise you I won't forsake Lydia.

952
01:14:55,180 --> 01:14:56,260
I'll go with you.

953
01:14:56,424 --> 01:14:58,309
No you must stay here to protect Longbourn.

954
01:14:58,333 --> 01:14:59,500
Ride at once both of you.

955
01:14:59,975 --> 01:15:02,180
I will take the rest of your family back with me to Rosings.

956
01:15:02,229 --> 01:15:04,580
There's no safer place.

957
01:15:05,252 --> 01:15:07,580
Collect your people.

958
01:15:16,700 --> 01:15:18,420
All of London's fallen to the zombies.

959
01:15:18,540 --> 01:15:20,271
We have urgent business on the other side.

960
01:15:20,270 --> 01:15:22,460
This bridge is rigged with all the explosives left in England.

961
01:15:22,780 --> 01:15:24,520
It's to be detonated tomorrow at dawn.

962
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:26,180
And the last squadron withdrawn from the "inbetween."

963
01:15:26,180 --> 01:15:28,140
Our boys can't hold them much longer.

964
01:15:28,194 --> 01:15:32,500
If the undead of London take the bridge,
the rest of England will surely be lost.

965
01:15:32,820 --> 01:15:33,580
Nevertheless.

966
01:15:34,229 --> 01:15:36,700
We mustn't turn back.

967
01:16:46,820 --> 01:16:49,380
Hello, Ms. Bennet.

968
01:17:17,980 --> 01:17:19,620
Pottersfield.

969
01:17:19,940 --> 01:17:21,206
Yes, quite.

970
01:17:22,796 --> 01:17:23,760
What?

971
01:17:23,860 --> 01:17:26,500
This. What we're standing on.

972
01:17:26,820 --> 01:17:29,420
It's an unmarked zombie graveyard.

973
01:17:29,980 --> 01:17:32,460
Yes of course.

974
01:17:38,900 --> 01:17:41,506
Ms. Bennet was possible cause would the two of you have

975
01:17:41,500 --> 01:17:44,540
for leaving Hertfordshire and entering into the inbetween?

976
01:17:45,900 --> 01:17:49,060
If adventures will not befall a young lady in her own village,

977
01:17:49,060 --> 01:17:51,460
she must seek them abroad.

978
01:17:54,780 --> 01:17:57,380
We had no choice.

979
01:17:57,820 --> 01:17:59,540
Wickham has run off with Lydia.

980
01:17:59,860 --> 01:18:03,420
He's taken her to where his zombie aristocrats congregate.

981
01:18:03,860 --> 01:18:05,580
St. Lazarus.

982
01:18:12,403 --> 01:18:14,024
St. Lazarus?

983
01:18:15,453 --> 01:18:17,540
I know it well.

984
01:18:19,540 --> 01:18:21,000
I saw it razed to the ground.

985
01:18:21,220 --> 01:18:23,500
Five days ago.

986
01:18:23,820 --> 01:18:26,620
Your sister couldn't have possibly survived.

987
01:18:30,820 --> 01:18:33,540
I'm profoundly sorry for your loss.

988
01:18:34,020 --> 01:18:35,620
Colonel Darcy.

989
01:18:40,820 --> 01:18:44,500
I feel I must depart for Hingham Bridge immediately.

990
01:18:44,980 --> 01:18:47,580
Of course.

991
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:06,215
Let's see how reasonable his aristocrats are

992
01:19:06,210 --> 01:19:07,880
after their apetites have been whet.

993
01:19:07,900 --> 01:19:11,342
On my mark. Now.

994
01:19:12,860 --> 01:19:15,500
Dawn breaks at five o clock tomorrow.

995
01:19:16,540 --> 01:19:20,380
- I'll make it back.
- Course you will old man.

996
01:19:20,486 --> 01:19:23,975
The order must be given at first light, no matter what.

997
01:19:24,780 --> 01:19:26,620
I'll give the order.

998
01:20:18,900 --> 01:20:21,420
I fear I should not have confided in Darcy.

999
01:20:21,420 --> 01:20:24,660
Fear the hordes of ravenous unmentionables swarming our way.

1000
01:20:26,820 --> 01:20:30,700
Liz, London has already fallen and
the Grand Barrier burns as we speak.

1001
01:20:37,820 --> 01:20:40,460
Hingham Bridge is behind us.

1002
01:20:40,780 --> 01:20:42,540
London's over there.

1003
01:20:43,561 --> 01:20:46,460
Which direction are you looking in Mr. Bingley?

1004
01:20:47,020 --> 01:20:49,580
St. Lazarus.

1005
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:52,406
- Darcy lied..
- To spare you...

1006
01:20:52,740 --> 01:20:54,852
He'd risk anything for you Ms. Bennet.

1007
01:20:54,850 --> 01:20:58,580
Lizzy. Lizzy!

1008
01:21:10,900 --> 01:21:13,660
Who would steal the brains of dead soldiers?

1009
01:22:13,820 --> 01:22:16,420
- Mr. Darcy.
- it's alright.

1010
01:22:17,860 --> 01:22:19,540
He said you'd come.

1011
01:22:21,820 --> 01:22:23,540
Mr. Darcy!

1012
01:22:39,756 --> 01:22:41,015
Bastard.

1013
01:22:42,393 --> 01:22:44,540
My god you're so predictable.

1014
01:22:45,158 --> 01:22:48,500
I knew by taking young Lydia you'd have
to protect the Bennet's honor.

1015
01:22:48,820 --> 01:22:51,380
So, come to kill me then?

1016
01:22:51,589 --> 01:22:52,700
On the contrary.

1017
01:22:53,020 --> 01:22:55,620
I've come to make you an offer.

1018
01:22:59,020 --> 01:23:00,660
The Bennets

1019
01:23:01,565 --> 01:23:04,380
Have authorized me to offer
you a commission of 10,000 pounds.

1020
01:23:04,532 --> 01:23:06,761
To return Lydia and leave England for good.

1021
01:23:06,900 --> 01:23:10,620
How very noble of you to deliver the Bennet's
offer but I'm afraid my answer is no.

1022
01:23:11,366 --> 01:23:14,420
And is the "no" financial inducement?

1023
01:23:14,511 --> 01:23:16,860
To convince you to do the honorable thing, George.

1024
01:23:17,820 --> 01:23:19,380
None.

1025
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:22,460
You see money is off no use to me now.

1026
01:23:25,900 --> 01:23:28,460
Is that your father's watch?

1027
01:23:28,820 --> 01:23:29,660
Yes.

1028
01:23:30,483 --> 01:23:32,620
Give it to me.

1029
01:23:38,740 --> 01:23:40,500
No.

1030
01:24:48,020 --> 01:24:49,420
Lydia, listen to me.

1031
01:24:49,740 --> 01:24:51,260
You have to get across Hingham Bridge.

1032
01:24:51,290 --> 01:24:54,060
- Mr. Darcy? - As long as Wickham lives England is in peril.

1033
01:24:54,060 --> 01:24:55,500
Go Lydia! Go!

1034
01:25:07,820 --> 01:25:09,540
I conquered London, Darcy.

1035
01:25:09,900 --> 01:25:12,420
Do you really think you can defeat me?

1036
01:25:12,740 --> 01:25:14,380
Always have.

1037
01:25:31,740 --> 01:25:33,100
You're a traitor George!

1038
01:25:33,140 --> 01:25:35,660
No, I'm a King!

1039
01:26:00,740 --> 01:26:01,660
Lydia!

1040
01:26:01,980 --> 01:26:03,580
Lydia!

1041
01:26:31,740 --> 01:26:32,660
It's time sir.

1042
01:26:39,780 --> 01:26:40,700
Seven minutes.

1043
01:26:49,740 --> 01:26:50,540
Rider!

1044
01:26:50,900 --> 01:26:52,460
Wait!

1045
01:26:57,740 --> 01:26:58,540
Lydia!

1046
01:26:58,860 --> 01:27:00,500
Where are the others?

1047
01:27:40,820 --> 01:27:43,540
I just wanted to fall in love!

1048
01:27:43,860 --> 01:27:47,220
If I had the living your father intended
me I never would've been in the army!

1049
01:27:47,273 --> 01:27:48,946
I never would've been infected!

1050
01:27:49,151 --> 01:27:50,540
This is your doing Darcy!

1051
01:27:51,144 --> 01:27:53,046
I survived it wasn't easy.

1052
01:27:53,314 --> 01:27:56,243
With Lydia gone, I have my hatred of you to sustain me!

1053
01:27:56,511 --> 01:27:58,685
The Four Horsemen have risen from hell!

1054
01:27:59,060 --> 01:28:00,737
The zombie apocalypse is here!

1055
01:28:01,133 --> 01:28:03,137
I am the one you've been waiting for!

1056
01:28:03,206 --> 01:28:04,460
The one to lead them!

1057
01:28:04,820 --> 01:28:05,900
Every life I take...

1058
01:28:06,274 --> 01:28:07,820
Every atrocity I commit...

1059
01:28:07,933 --> 01:28:09,540
is on your head!

1060
01:28:23,874 --> 01:28:25,572
Can't delay any longer sir.

1061
01:28:26,149 --> 01:28:28,869
The undead will have reached the
bridge soon and then it'll be too late.

1062
01:28:29,033 --> 01:28:31,276
Their not back yet you must wait Bingley!

1063
01:28:34,740 --> 01:28:35,540
Give the order.

1064
01:28:35,860 --> 01:28:37,580
- Give the order!
- Yes, sir.

1065
01:29:04,980 --> 01:29:06,540
Liz!

1066
01:30:46,205 --> 01:30:49,420
The very first moment I beheld you,

1067
01:30:50,024 --> 01:30:53,053
My heart was irrevocably gone.

1068
01:31:57,740 --> 01:32:00,000
Lady Catherine—might I take this opportunity

1069
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,460
to compliment you on your pantaloons?

1070
01:32:03,940 --> 01:32:05,460
And your eyepatch.

1071
01:32:05,968 --> 01:32:07,033
Very fetching is it?

1072
01:32:07,631 --> 01:32:08,963
Function or fashion?

1073
01:32:08,977 --> 01:32:09,660
Function.

1074
01:32:13,339 --> 01:32:14,540
Her ladyship.

1075
01:32:15,780 --> 01:32:18,066
Guess whose speaking with Papa in the library its-

1076
01:32:18,060 --> 01:32:19,500
Mr. Bingley.

1077
01:32:22,848 --> 01:32:23,620
Lady Catherine.

1078
01:32:29,780 --> 01:32:31,540
This is all rather embarrassing.

1079
01:32:32,622 --> 01:32:35,980
But I would like to request the privilege of speaking with Ms. Jane.

1080
01:32:36,566 --> 01:32:37,676
Alone.

1081
01:32:50,386 --> 01:32:51,575
Mr. Darcy.

1082
01:32:54,031 --> 01:32:55,179
My favorite nephew.

1083
01:32:55,394 --> 01:32:56,973
You lay unconscious for so long,

1084
01:32:56,970 --> 01:32:58,140
that when we'd heard you'd risen

1085
01:32:58,140 --> 01:33:00,220
we had feared you had
joined the ranks of the undead.

1086
01:33:01,700 --> 01:33:02,987
Any word from the canal?

1087
01:33:03,227 --> 01:33:04,660
It's holding for the time being.

1088
01:33:06,740 --> 01:33:07,620
Yes!

1089
01:33:09,740 --> 01:33:11,420
Would you excuse me?

1090
01:33:26,780 --> 01:33:27,620
Ms. Bennet.

1091
01:33:30,820 --> 01:33:32,460
Mr. Darcy.

1092
01:33:34,700 --> 01:33:36,420
Look as though you are fully mended.

1093
01:33:36,780 --> 01:33:38,700
I am. Thank you.

1094
01:33:39,554 --> 01:33:41,660
If it wasn't for you I'd of surely perished.

1095
01:33:42,542 --> 01:33:44,620
You have saved me in more ways than one.

1096
01:33:47,081 --> 01:33:49,460
What you said to me on Hingham Bridge.

1097
01:33:51,780 --> 01:33:53,460
You heard me?

1098
01:33:53,980 --> 01:33:55,580
I did.

1099
01:33:57,346 --> 01:33:58,580
It gave me hope.

1100
01:33:59,499 --> 01:34:00,278
For what?

1101
01:34:01,297 --> 01:34:03,620
That your feelings towards me may have changed?

1102
01:34:06,525 --> 01:34:09,620
However one word from you now will silence me on the subject forever.

1103
01:34:30,860 --> 01:34:34,380
You are the love of my life Elizabeth Bennet.

1104
01:34:36,980 --> 01:34:39,380
So I ask you now...

1105
01:34:39,820 --> 01:34:41,540
half in anguish...

1106
01:34:41,940 --> 01:34:43,620
half in hope...

1107
01:34:46,860 --> 01:34:50,380
Will you do me the great great honor,

1108
01:34:50,900 --> 01:34:52,620
of taking me for your husband?

1109
01:34:57,980 --> 01:34:59,620
Yes.

1110
01:35:18,980 --> 01:35:20,620
Dearly beloved...

1111
01:35:20,980 --> 01:35:24,500
We're gathered here today in the sight of God,

1112
01:35:24,900 --> 01:35:29,460
To join together this man and this woman.

1113
01:35:29,980 --> 01:35:33,460
And this man and this woman.

1114
01:35:33,780 --> 01:35:35,660
In holy matrimony.

1115
01:35:36,740 --> 01:35:40,660
I now pronounce you man and wife.

1116
01:35:40,980 --> 01:35:44,580
And man and wife.

1117
01:35:45,020 --> 01:35:49,620
You may now kiss the brides.

1118
01:35:50,740 --> 01:35:52,620
You may now kiss the brides!

1119
01:35:58,940 --> 01:36:00,540
Oh...
