That was in your questions.

Why would you
do that to me?

174
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:57,925
Because whenever he's
in the society pages,

175
00:11:58,093 --> 00:12:00,761
he's never been
photographed with a woman.
So, naturally...

Well, maybe he just
wants to keep his

1315
01:32:32,047 --> 01:32:33,247
And this is my father,
Carrick.

1316
01:32:33,340 --> 01:32:35,549
Hi, pleasure to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

1317
01:32:35,717 --> 01:32:37,509
MIA: Is she here?
You are the subject
of some speculation.

1318
01:32:37,677 --> 01:32:40,346
Oh, my God, you exist!

1319
01:32:41,264 --> 01:32:43,849
It's a great apartment,
and the rent's
not ridiculous.

1320
01:32:44,017 --> 01:32:45,851
Elliot and José
helped us move in.

1321
01:32:46,519 --> 01:32:47,686
José is Ana's friend.

1322
01:32:48,229 --> 01:32:50,939
Although, I think
that Elliot's
trying to poach him.

1323
01:32:51,024 --> 01:32:53,192
They've sparked
quite the bromance.

1324
01:32:53,360 --> 01:32:54,860
He's a cool guy.

1325
01:32:55,278 --> 01:32:57,529
Ana, where is
your family from?

1326
01:32:58,114 --> 01:33:00,908
My stepfather
lives in Montesano,
and my mom's in Georgia.

1327
01:33:01,076 --> 01:33:02,701
Georgia? Which part?

1328
01:33:02,869 --> 01:33:04,036
Savannah.

1329
01:33:04,204 --> 01:33:05,287
How nice.

1330
01:33:05,455 --> 01:33:08,415
Although, I do hear
it gets rather humid
in Georgia this time of year.

1331
01:33:08,583 --> 01:33:09,875
Oh, my God, it does.

1332
01:33:10,293 --> 01:33:12,044
It's stifling sometimes.

1333
01:33:12,212 --> 01:33:14,088
Actually, I'm going
to visit her tomorrow.

1334
01:33:14,547 --> 01:33:16,048
DR. GREY: Oh, how nice.
Mmm-hmm.

1335
01:33:16,216 --> 01:33:17,716
You hear that, Christian?

1336
01:33:17,884 --> 01:33:21,303
Some children do
visit their parents
now and again.

1337
01:33:22,889 --> 01:33:24,556
Hey, Dad, you catch
the Mariners game?

1338
01:33:24,724 --> 01:33:26,164
Uh, I heard it went
to extra innings.

1339
01:33:26,267 --> 01:33:28,268
Ugh. Seattle baseball...
(SPEAKING FRENCH)

1340
01:33:28,812 --> 01:33:29,812
This is news to me.

1341
01:33:31,564 --> 01:33:32,981
When were you gonna tell me?

1342
01:33:33,900 --> 01:33:35,734
DR. GREY: Who wants coffee?

1343
01:33:35,902 --> 01:33:39,154
Actually, I promised Ana
a tour of the grounds.

1344
01:33:39,322 --> 01:33:40,906
Excuse us.

1345
01:33:45,453 --> 01:33:48,914
ANASTASIA: Christian,
I cannot walk that fast
in these shoes.

1346
01:33:50,125 --> 01:33:51,405
(CHRISTIAN GRUNTS)
ANASTASIA: Oh.

1347
01:33:52,168 --> 01:33:54,086
When were you gonna
tell me about Georgia?

1348
01:33:54,254 --> 01:33:56,296
What? You have
no right to be mad.

1349
01:33:56,464 --> 01:33:59,425
Yeah, but I am mad.
Palm-twitchingly mad.

1350
01:33:59,592 --> 01:34:00,592
Ow!

1351
01:34:03,763 --> 01:34:04,763
You're mine.

1352
01:34:04,931 --> 01:34:06,807
All mine, you understand?

1353
01:34:13,940 --> 01:34:16,024
Christian,
you are so confusing.

1354
01:34:19,737 --> 01:34:20,737
Ana.

1355
01:34:21,156 --> 01:34:22,781
What do you want?

1356
01:34:23,783 --> 01:34:24,950
What do you want?

1357
01:34:25,118 --> 01:34:26,702
I want you.

1358
01:34:27,620 --> 01:34:29,621
(SIGHS) I'm trying,
Christian.

1359
01:34:33,877 --> 01:34:35,461
I know you are.

1360
01:34:36,296 --> 01:34:38,630
Why can't we sleep
in the same bed?

1361
01:34:39,340 --> 01:34:41,467
Why won't you let me
touch you?

1362
01:34:41,968 --> 01:34:44,178
Why does it have
to be like this?

1363
01:34:51,019 --> 01:34:52,311
If you would just
sign the contract,

1364
01:34:52,395 --> 01:34:53,437
you wouldn't have
to think about...

1365
01:34:53,521 --> 01:34:55,601
Why do you care
so much about
the contract, Christian?

1366
01:34:55,690 --> 01:34:57,733
Don't you like me
the way I am?

1367
01:34:57,984 --> 01:34:59,234
Of course I do.

1368
01:34:59,486 --> 01:35:01,320
Then why are you
trying to change me?

1369
01:35:01,821 --> 01:35:03,322
I'm not.

1370
01:35:04,574 --> 01:35:05,574
It's...

1371
01:35:05,825 --> 01:35:08,660
I need more. I want more.

1372
01:35:09,829 --> 01:35:11,538
Hearts and flowers?

1373
01:35:12,332 --> 01:35:14,333
That's not something I know.

1374
01:35:16,127 --> 01:35:17,669
Ana, please.

1375
01:35:19,797 --> 01:35:22,341
It's you that's changing me.

1376
01:35:23,843 --> 01:35:25,969
Let me touch you.

1377
01:35:26,679 --> 01:35:28,305
Let me.

1378
01:35:41,986 --> 01:35:43,570
Are they burns?

1379
01:35:44,697 --> 01:35:47,032
I had a rough start in life.

1380
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:48,700
That's all you need to know.

1381
01:35:50,870 --> 01:35:52,371
Okay.

1382
01:36:14,894 --> 01:36:17,396
The woman that
gave birth to me

1383
01:36:18,189 --> 01:36:20,274
was a crack addict

1384
01:36:21,025 --> 01:36:23,235
and a prostitute.

1385
01:36:27,407 --> 01:36:29,408
She died when I was four.

1386
01:36:33,079 --> 01:36:35,247
I remember certain things.

1387
01:36:38,376 --> 01:36:40,252
Terrible things.

1388
01:36:44,257 --> 01:36:46,425
But I don't remember her.

1389
01:36:49,429 --> 01:36:51,263
But sometimes,

1390
01:36:53,433 --> 01:36:55,892
I think I see her
in my dreams.

1391
01:37:13,119 --> 01:37:14,119
Mmm.

1392
01:37:15,288 --> 01:37:17,331
Do you really have
to go to Georgia?

1393
01:37:21,586 --> 01:37:23,837
Yeah, I really do.

1394
01:37:28,259 --> 01:37:30,302
Good morning. 12-H is
down to your right.

1395

1396

to be in coach.

been upgraded.

very healthy, Bob.

You'll get fat with
all this sitting around.
You tell him, Ana.

1406
01:38:37,703 --> 01:38:38,954
I'm not gonna tell him that.

1407

Yes, thank you, Ana.

1408
01:38:40,873 --> 01:38:44,334
I'm just saying that
gazpacho is basically
eating a bowl of salsa.

1409
01:38:44,502 --> 01:38:47,337
You should hand me some chips
with my bowl of salsa here.

1410

You can have a carrot.
