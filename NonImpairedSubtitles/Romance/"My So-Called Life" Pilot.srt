Excuse me...

3
00:00:07,954 --> 00:00:10,616
Could you spare some
change, for a phone call?

4
00:00:10,691 --> 00:00:12,352
lt's an emergency.

5
00:00:12,959 --> 00:00:14,950
See, okay, see, this guy, like...

6
00:00:15,028 --> 00:00:19,761

you know my sister and l...

7
00:00:19,833 --> 00:00:21,664
We're, we're twins--

8
00:00:21,735 --> 00:00:23,566
No, we're not the kind
of twins who look alike.

9
00:00:23,637 --> 00:00:25,605
We just finish
each other's sentences.

10
00:00:25,672 --> 00:00:27,663
That was cool.
How'd we do that?

11
00:00:28,975 --> 00:00:32,035
H i, could you spare some change?

12
00:00:32,646 --> 00:00:36,639
She's upset, you see...

13
00:00:36,717 --> 00:00:40,050
you look a little like
her mother who's in a coma.

14
00:00:45,625 --> 00:00:49,083
Excuse her, she's hypoglycemic...

15
00:00:49,162 --> 00:00:52,427
l've got to get her some chocolate.

16

22
00:01:22,596 --> 00:01:24,587
which is like so low.

23

l mean, it's just, l know, if she
doesn't want to be in yearbook...

24
00:01:29,035 --> 00:01:31,026
she should, like, quit...

l mean, she always
does stuff like that.

33
00:02:14,181 --> 00:02:17,173
l mean, it's not like too
embarrassing for me to know this...

35
00:02:30,931 --> 00:02:32,831

around in a towel, okay?

92
00:06:13,386 --> 00:06:16,355
- You can tell her.
- No, l can't.

93

lf l could tell her,
l would tell her. You tell her.

Or get her a bigger towel.

God, Chelsea Clinton.
Will you look at this?

96

No freedom, no privacy, constant

cutting class, doing drugs.

Having sex. Like we did.

102
00:07:07,173 --> 00:07:11,405
l never cut class, and you
never had sex in high school.

103
00:07:11,478 --> 00:07:16,541
You know, l know why she did it.
She did it to get me to react.

104
00:07:16,616 --> 00:07:18,174
Maybe she just did it to do it.

105
00:07:18,251 --> 00:07:20,481
- No, she did it to get a reaction.
- Well then don't react!

- l thought you liked yearbook.

154
00:11:26,599 --> 00:11:28,260
l found it!

155
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:34,103
Well don't thank me or anything.

156
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:36,331
Get out of my room.

157
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:40,108
And when were you
planning on telling me?

158
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:43,774
Listen to me.
' l thought you liked yearbook. '

159
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:45,841
'Your room is a disaster. '

160
00:11:45,918 --> 00:11:48,910
Do you think l ever dreamed
that l would sound like this?

161
00:11:49,322 --> 00:11:53,850
Angela, l am not cleaning this up!

162
00:12:02,435 --> 00:12:05,700
So, Rickie, Angela's in
love with Jordan Catalano.

163
00:12:05,772 --> 00:12:08,172
- We have to help her.
- Rayanne!

164
00:12:08,241 --> 00:12:12,109
Oh come on, l can tell Rickie.
You got to come to Tino's tonight.

165
00:12:12,178 --> 00:12:14,976
- He'll be there.
- He doesn't even know me.

166
00:12:15,248 --> 00:12:18,274
- Am l making a fool of myself?
- l don't know.

167
00:12:18,785 --> 00:12:21,117
Rickie, give us the male perspective.

168
00:12:21,187 --> 00:12:23,178
Don't you love how he leans?

169
00:12:23,256 --> 00:12:26,692
See, l don't get obsessed with him,
so l don't have these problems.

170
00:12:27,193 --> 00:12:30,185
Oh God, that's the second bell.

171
00:12:32,698 --> 00:12:35,360
l mean, l may as well go to Bio.

172
00:12:35,435 --> 00:12:38,097
Since l'm not all that busy.

173
00:12:52,385 --> 00:12:56,378
And, what is the purpose of plasma?

174
00:12:57,723 --> 00:13:02,217
The purpose of plasma is to...what?

175
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:06,162
Why do we need plasma?

176
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,389
Brian?

177
00:13:09,068 --> 00:13:11,059
Because the league of nations failed.

178
00:13:12,238 --> 00:13:14,900
And why did the league
of nations fail?

179
00:13:18,678 --> 00:13:19,667
Brian.

180
00:13:19,745 --> 00:13:21,508
Because it's written
in the first person.

181
00:13:21,747 --> 00:13:24,011
Exactly, thank you.

182
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:27,746
Does she say:
'She was forced to go into hiding'?

183
00:13:29,388 --> 00:13:31,356
Somebody else besides Brian.

184
00:13:33,426 --> 00:13:35,917
- Brian?
- No.

185
00:13:35,995 --> 00:13:40,989
No, she says, ' l',
' l was forced to go into hiding. '

186
00:13:42,435 --> 00:13:46,769
lt's called the first person, okay?
This will be on the quiz.

187
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:52,208
So how would you
describe Anne Frank?

188
00:13:52,612 --> 00:13:54,273
Lucky.

189
00:13:54,447 --> 00:13:57,439
ls that supposed
to be funny, Angela?

190
00:14:02,922 --> 00:14:05,755
How on earth could you make
a statement like that?

191
00:14:17,737 --> 00:14:20,570
Anne Frank perished
in a concentration camp.

192
00:14:21,307 --> 00:14:25,038
Anne Frank is a tragic figure.
How could Anne Frank be lucky?

193
00:14:25,811 --> 00:14:28,041
l don't know.

194
00:14:28,214 --> 00:14:30,705
Because she was
trapped in an attic...

195
00:14:30,783 --> 00:14:33,445
for three years with
this guy she really liked?

196
00:14:47,233 --> 00:14:50,361
Excuse my eating,
but with all these cutbacks...

197
00:14:50,436 --> 00:14:53,667
l don't really get a
lunch break on Thursdays.

198
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:56,571
Sit down, Angela.

199
00:15:02,515 --> 00:15:06,849
<i>Seelng a teacher's actual</i>
<i>lunch ls, llke, so depresslng, </i>

200
00:15:07,119 --> 00:15:09,246
<i>Not to mentlon her bra strap, </i>

201
00:15:09,689 --> 00:15:15,685
So, you quit yearbook?
No explanation.

202
00:15:19,031 --> 00:15:21,124
Your appearance has altered.

203
00:15:21,767 --> 00:15:25,100
l'm really concerned you're
getting off on the wrong foot.

204
00:15:26,305 --> 00:15:28,466
ls there a problem at home?

205
00:15:33,646 --> 00:15:36,444
lt just seems like...

206
00:15:36,515 --> 00:15:41,009
you agree to have a certain
personality or something.

207
00:15:42,221 --> 00:15:47,215
For no reason. J ust to make
things easier for everyone.

208
00:15:49,562 --> 00:15:53,896
But when you think about it,
how do you know it's even you?

209
00:16:00,573 --> 00:16:03,565
And, l mean, this whole thing
with yearbook. lt's like...

210
00:16:03,643 --> 00:16:07,170
everybody is in this
big hurry to make this book...

211
00:16:07,246 --> 00:16:10,147
to supposedly remember
what happened but...

212
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:14,015
it's not even what really happened,
it's what everyone thinks...

213
00:16:14,086 --> 00:16:16,554
was supposed to happen.

214
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:20,923
Because if you made a book
of what really happened...

215
00:16:21,694 --> 00:16:23,855
it'd be a really upsetting book.

216
00:16:26,599 --> 00:16:28,931
You know, in my humble opinion.

217
00:16:48,321 --> 00:16:50,312
<i>My dad sells prlntlng, </i>

218
00:16:51,023 --> 00:16:53,014
<i>lt was ln my mom's famlly, </i>

219
00:16:53,092 --> 00:16:56,289
<i>My dad was just supposed</i>
<i>to do lt for a whlle,,, </i>

220
00:16:56,362 --> 00:16:59,092
<i>then he was supposed to go</i>
<i>chef school, but he never dld, </i>

221
00:16:59,632 --> 00:17:01,224
<i>l'm not sure why, </i>

222
00:17:03,703 --> 00:17:06,695
You should see what they call
"chili con carne" at school.

223
00:17:07,239 --> 00:17:10,333
- First of all, it's just beans.
- That's not "chili con carne."

224
00:17:10,409 --> 00:17:13,207
- l know.
- "Con carne." With meat.

225
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:14,109
l know.

226
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:16,842
l think it's the lack of meat
is destroying America.

227
00:17:18,084 --> 00:17:20,416
<i>My mom took over the buslness, </i>

228
00:17:20,486 --> 00:17:22,681
<i>She's klnd of my dad's boss now,,, </i>

229
00:17:22,755 --> 00:17:25,087
<i>whlch l guess he trles</i>
<i>not to thlnk about, </i>

230
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:30,592
Mom won't be home until late.

231
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:33,924
You know, l think you give her...

232
00:17:33,999 --> 00:17:36,661
too hard a time, sometimes.

233
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:41,833
She just wants you to be happy.
She wants everyone to be happy.

234
00:17:42,508 --> 00:17:44,499
No, that's you.

235
00:17:47,179 --> 00:17:50,273
My point...l mean.

236
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:55,746
Think of all the things
that she does, for you.

237
00:17:58,991 --> 00:18:02,051
Out of nowhere,
she'll get in this mood.

238
00:18:03,496 --> 00:18:05,760
And her lips will get all tight.

239
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:11,000
lt's just so obvious that she's
looking for someone to blame.

240
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:13,261
Yeah.

241
00:18:15,808 --> 00:18:18,800
But you know
that's not the real her.

242
00:18:20,045 --> 00:18:22,536
J ust try to be nicer to her.

243
00:18:24,216 --> 00:18:26,548
Once in a while.

244
00:18:26,619 --> 00:18:28,610
As an experiment.

245
00:18:29,388 --> 00:18:31,049
Okay.

246
00:18:38,397 --> 00:18:41,230
Dad, there's this thing tonight...

247
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:43,632
at a friend of Rayanne's house.

248
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:47,903
Like, this rehearsal?

249
00:18:50,176 --> 00:18:54,010
For this play that we might
all do as extra credit.

250
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:57,247
And l know mom says
no going out on school nights...

251
00:18:57,316 --> 00:18:59,841
but this is like part of school...

252
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:03,855
and l won't be home late,
and l just really want to go.

253
00:21:57,763 --> 00:22:00,095
This doesn't seem like a Friday.

254
00:22:02,401 --> 00:22:04,062
lt's Thursday.

255
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,671
Are you sure?

256
00:22:11,477 --> 00:22:13,809
Yesterday was Wednesday, so...

257
00:22:16,448 --> 00:22:18,609
Oh...right.

258
00:22:20,285 --> 00:22:22,412
So, that's how l know.

259
00:22:29,495 --> 00:22:32,123
Jordan, this bites.
Let's go over to Grunden's.

260
00:22:45,544 --> 00:22:47,535
- The point is--
- No, l know what the point is.

261
00:22:47,613 --> 00:22:50,878
The point is...l can't believe
we're having this conversation.

262
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:53,041
- l know.
- l can't believe it.

263
00:22:53,118 --> 00:22:55,916
- We need a new conversation.
- l shouldn't have allowed her to--

264
00:22:56,155 --> 00:22:58,419
Why do l always have
to be the mean one?

265
00:22:58,557 --> 00:23:01,219
Why can't you be the mean
one every once in a while?

266
00:23:01,293 --> 00:23:04,456
- l can be!
- But you never are. Look...

267
00:23:06,165 --> 00:23:07,655
l'm calm, okay?

268
00:23:07,733 --> 00:23:09,724
But you can't keep letting...

269
00:23:09,802 --> 00:23:12,100
l mean you know she
loves you more anyway...

270
00:23:12,171 --> 00:23:13,695
She doesn't love me more!

271
00:23:13,772 --> 00:23:16,400
She does. Come on.
She loves you more.

272
00:23:16,475 --> 00:23:18,966
l accept that. But,
that's not enough for you.

273
00:23:19,144 --> 00:23:20,805
You have to--

274
00:23:22,848 --> 00:23:25,840
l don't want to fight. Actually...

275
00:23:25,918 --> 00:23:28,751
l'm not even that upset.

276
00:23:32,091 --> 00:23:36,323
Where the hell have you been?
Oh my God, what happened to you?

277
00:23:36,395 --> 00:23:37,521
Are you alright? What happened?

278
00:23:37,596 --> 00:23:39,928
Did you explain it to her?

279
00:23:40,532 --> 00:23:44,559
- Excuse me, you explain it to her.
- Alright. Maybe it isn't her fault!

280
00:23:44,636 --> 00:23:47,264
Graham, of course it's
her fault, she snowed you!

281
00:23:47,339 --> 00:23:49,000
- l told you she said--
- Shut up!

282
00:23:49,708 --> 00:23:51,903
- What did l do?
- l'm sorry, sweetheart.

283
00:23:52,678 --> 00:23:55,078
Could we just find out what
happened? Could we just find out--

284
00:23:55,247 --> 00:23:57,681
How do you expect her to
have any respect for me?

285
00:23:57,750 --> 00:24:00,548
l respect you, God!

286
00:24:02,888 --> 00:24:07,348
Nothing happened.
l fell in some mud. l'm alright.

287
00:24:18,537 --> 00:24:21,529
l think we should all go to bed.

288
00:24:43,996 --> 00:24:45,657
What really happened?

289
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:04,408
So there's this rave tonight,
okay, at that club, Let's Bolt.

290
00:25:04,983 --> 00:25:09,545
Tino can get us in. Guaranteed,
Jordan Catalano will be there.

291
00:25:10,289 --> 00:25:12,689
What? lt's perfect, and you don't
have to think of anything to say...

292
00:25:12,758 --> 00:25:14,919
to him because no one
can hear anybody.

293
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:18,122
l think lard is my
favorite food group.

294
00:25:24,303 --> 00:25:27,795
<i>The cafeterla ls the embarrassment</i>
<i>capltal of the world, </i>

295
00:25:28,273 --> 00:25:30,264
<i>lt's llke a prlson movle, </i>

296
00:25:35,147 --> 00:25:37,138
So, where do you want to sit?

297
00:25:37,216 --> 00:25:39,377
l don't have anything to
wear to a place like that.

298
00:25:40,018 --> 00:25:42,009
l'll lend you something.

299
00:25:42,087 --> 00:25:45,682
You have to look tough. Somebody
once set fire to my hair at Let's Bolt.

300
00:25:46,258 --> 00:25:48,249
Wait, so what's fat- free?

301
00:25:48,994 --> 00:25:52,259
When something's, like, free. Of fat.

302
00:25:52,331 --> 00:25:55,323
What's the difference between
fat- free, and like, nonfat?

303
00:25:56,335 --> 00:25:58,166
Good question.

304
00:25:59,671 --> 00:26:01,571
l'd have to think of a lie.

305
00:26:02,474 --> 00:26:04,465
Simple. You're staying
over at my place.

306
00:26:04,776 --> 00:26:08,769
And it's a perfect lie,
because you can stay over.

307
00:26:08,847 --> 00:26:10,838
My mom won't even be there.

308
00:26:12,618 --> 00:26:13,949
l've got to go find Tino.

309
00:26:16,855 --> 00:26:18,345
Think about it.

310
00:26:26,498 --> 00:26:28,489
ls there any soap in there?

311
00:26:29,468 --> 00:26:31,299
There's never soap.

312
00:26:34,239 --> 00:26:35,729
H i.

313
00:26:48,887 --> 00:26:52,846
So l...l just think you should know
what people are saying about you.

314
00:26:53,558 --> 00:26:54,718
What?

315
00:26:56,061 --> 00:27:00,327
That you think
you're so above everyone.

316
00:27:00,699 --> 00:27:05,068
And that Rayanne Graff
is like God to you now...

317
00:27:05,137 --> 00:27:07,128
and you just do whatever she says.

318
00:27:07,239 --> 00:27:10,731
And by the way, she's just using
you like she did with Jody Barsh.

319
00:27:11,176 --> 00:27:13,007
l just thought you should know.

320
00:27:13,445 --> 00:27:15,504
What'd she do to Jody Barsh?

321
00:27:17,182 --> 00:27:20,242
Oh please. That's like so known.

322
00:27:24,256 --> 00:27:26,850
So tell me what l did, Angela.

323
00:27:26,925 --> 00:27:28,916
l mean, l would
really like to know.

324
00:27:31,229 --> 00:27:33,220
Nothing. lt's not
something that you--

325
00:27:33,298 --> 00:27:35,789
So you just drop your oldest
friend for no reason?

326
00:27:36,668 --> 00:27:39,398
l mean, just tell me what l did.

327
00:27:41,773 --> 00:27:43,604
l can't.

328
00:27:44,076 --> 00:27:47,204
lt's not like one thing,
it's not like that.

329
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:50,373
Okay, great. So, just,
never speak to me again.

330
00:27:50,449 --> 00:27:52,440
Real mature Angela.

331
00:27:53,118 --> 00:27:55,109
No, l want to speak to you.
l never wanted--

332
00:27:55,187 --> 00:27:56,950
No, forget it!

333
00:28:09,134 --> 00:28:12,399
God, you and your hair.

334
00:28:15,974 --> 00:28:18,966
Did Patty, like, hemorrhage
first time she saw it?

335
00:28:21,813 --> 00:28:23,474
l n a sense.

336
00:28:24,149 --> 00:28:26,140
Well, l have to say...

337
00:28:28,086 --> 00:28:29,917
l hate it.

338
00:28:42,567 --> 00:28:47,903
Hey! You know what l think? l think
that we should all go ice skating.

339
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:53,402
l mean it. All of us.
lce skating. Hot chocolate.

340
00:28:53,478 --> 00:28:57,005
Sprained ankles. l'm in the mood.

341
00:28:57,082 --> 00:28:59,482
So, there's this movie on
tonight, l really want to watch.

342
00:28:59,651 --> 00:29:03,109
lt's about this girl. She gets
these obscene phone calls.

343
00:29:03,188 --> 00:29:05,679
- lt's like her job.
- Really?

344
00:29:05,824 --> 00:29:07,985
l told Neil that l'd shoot
pool with him tonight.

345
00:29:10,629 --> 00:29:12,620
You're seeing your
brother twice in one week?

346
00:29:12,697 --> 00:29:15,393
Well he broke up with her
again. l feel sorry for him.

347
00:29:15,467 --> 00:29:18,800
And then somebody, like, tries to
kill her, like, over the phone.

348
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:21,930
Well, l guess it's just us
girls tonight, which--

349
00:29:22,007 --> 00:29:25,306
So l'm grounded, just
because of last night?

350
00:29:25,377 --> 00:29:28,039
l never said that you were
grounded. What l said--

351
00:29:28,113 --> 00:29:30,377
So, Mom, l'm allowed to right?

352
00:29:30,882 --> 00:29:35,216
Because, Rayanne invited me
to sleep over at her house tonight.

353
00:29:35,387 --> 00:29:37,582
l am allowed to watch that, right?

354
00:29:37,889 --> 00:29:40,414
That girl from the other day?
That rude girl?

355
00:29:40,492 --> 00:29:41,857
She wasn't rude.

356
00:29:41,927 --> 00:29:43,918
She finished my cheese.

357
00:29:43,995 --> 00:29:45,986
l had this new brick of cheese.
She devoured it.

358
00:29:46,064 --> 00:29:48,089
- l'm allowed to. Right?
- You know...

359
00:29:48,166 --> 00:29:49,827
l have met this
Rayanne exactly once.

360
00:29:49,901 --> 00:29:51,801
l do not know her. l do
not know her parents.

361
00:29:53,105 --> 00:29:55,596
What? You never spent a
night at a friend's house?

362
00:29:55,674 --> 00:29:58,108
My parents knew my friends.

363
00:29:58,176 --> 00:30:00,736
- Mom, right?
- Yes, you may watch the movie.

364
00:30:00,812 --> 00:30:02,803
Mom, you offered the cheese.

365
00:30:02,881 --> 00:30:05,543
They knew all 900
of your friends personally?

366
00:30:05,617 --> 00:30:07,915
Okay, we've all heard this before.

367
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:11,082
<i>My parents went</i>
<i>to the same hlgh school,,, </i>

368
00:30:11,156 --> 00:30:13,647
<i>but they never</i>
<i>knew each other, then, </i>

369
00:30:14,459 --> 00:30:17,087
Did you know that they had to change
the date of the prom because...

370
00:30:17,162 --> 00:30:19,323
your mother was getting
her appendix out?

371
00:30:19,397 --> 00:30:21,558
l never asked them
to change the date.

372
00:30:21,633 --> 00:30:24,124
Meanwhile, l couldn't
get a girl to look at me.

373
00:30:29,007 --> 00:30:30,998
You don't even
have to drive me...

374
00:30:31,076 --> 00:30:32,907
because Rickie's cousin
said he would.

375
00:30:33,145 --> 00:30:36,137
Rickie's cousin!
Why didn't you say so?

376
00:30:36,214 --> 00:30:38,341
That eases my mind.

377
00:30:42,454 --> 00:30:44,115
- Angela!
- Patty.

378
00:30:45,891 --> 00:30:48,189
- Patty.
- You haven't met this Rickie.

379
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:51,957
- Stop calling him 'this Rickie. '
- l did parallel bars today.

380
00:30:52,063 --> 00:30:55,328
Ms. Siten said
my dismount was perfect.

381
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:58,062
l find Rickie a little confusing.

382
00:30:58,303 --> 00:31:02,865
Okay, so maybe he's bi. Who cares?
H is cousin can still drive.

383
00:31:02,941 --> 00:31:07,173
What? He's what? Do you hear
these terms she's throwing around?

384
00:31:07,245 --> 00:31:08,234
" Bi?"

385
00:31:08,313 --> 00:31:10,577
- lt means bisexual.
- He's bisexual?

386
00:31:10,649 --> 00:31:14,642
How can he be bi- anything? He's a
child, he's obviously very confused.

387
00:31:14,719 --> 00:31:17,210
- No, he's not confused.
- He wears eyeliner.

388
00:31:17,289 --> 00:31:18,881
He wears eyeliner?

389
00:31:18,957 --> 00:31:21,858
- l thought you were on my side.
- l'm not on anyone's side.

390
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:26,053
- Graham. Grow up. Choose a side.
- ls her mother going to be there?

391
00:31:26,131 --> 00:31:29,760
No. No, Rayanne lives by
her wits. l n an alley.

392
00:31:30,202 --> 00:31:32,727
Yes, obviously.
l mean, she's a mother.

393
00:31:32,804 --> 00:31:34,795
They live in the same place.

394
00:31:34,873 --> 00:31:37,137
Obviously her mother
is going to be there.

395
00:31:37,209 --> 00:31:39,803
Dad! Do you want to see
my headstand?

396
00:31:40,845 --> 00:31:45,680
Fine, go. Spend the night at
some total stranger's house.

397
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:47,877
- l don't care.
- Like you really mean that.

398
00:31:47,953 --> 00:31:50,285
No, go. And you, go shoot
pool with your brother...

399
00:31:50,355 --> 00:31:52,346
or wherever the hell you're going.

400
00:31:52,691 --> 00:31:55,626
Oh sure, so you can have it as
a grudge and never forgive me.

401
00:31:57,529 --> 00:31:59,520
Dad, are you looking?

402
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:03,691
Dad, are you looking?

403
00:32:33,398 --> 00:32:35,389
Hey Chase.

404
00:32:35,934 --> 00:32:38,061
Get out of here, Krakow.

405
00:32:44,509 --> 00:32:46,909
You're breaking like
1 4 different laws.

406
00:32:48,413 --> 00:32:50,244
You looked better before.

407
00:32:50,315 --> 00:32:52,476
- Like l'm devastated.
- Like l am.

408
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:57,420
Oh, look at me, l'm way cool.

409
00:32:57,489 --> 00:33:00,185
l'm off with my way cool
friends to sniff floor wax.

410
00:33:01,259 --> 00:33:03,819
- That's right, cover that zit.
- Want me to do yours?

411
00:33:04,429 --> 00:33:05,589
That hurt.

412
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:09,923
Who you waiting for? Catalano?
Maybe you're not going anywhere.

413
00:33:10,001 --> 00:33:13,368
- l mean, maybe you're just a...
- l'm going to Let's Bolt.

414
00:33:13,438 --> 00:33:15,429
an exhibitionist.

415
00:33:16,241 --> 00:33:18,732
Like they're really going
to let you into Let's Bolt.

416
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,970
Quit it!

417
00:33:24,049 --> 00:33:26,813
You're not stupid, don't act
like it. lt's a stupid act.

418
00:33:29,921 --> 00:33:33,254
Everybody is an act. l ncluding you.

419
00:33:37,128 --> 00:33:40,962
So have a really amazing night,
okay? l'm going to throw up now.

420
00:33:41,032 --> 00:33:43,023
Have a wonderful time.

421
00:33:49,341 --> 00:33:51,332
My clueless neighbor.

422
00:33:51,509 --> 00:33:54,444
You look so tough, this is
going to be one amazing night.

423
00:34:00,151 --> 00:34:02,142
Where is Tino?

424
00:34:02,987 --> 00:34:06,184
He'll be here, okay?
Haven't you ever waiting for anything?

425
00:34:06,324 --> 00:34:08,315
Yeah, for my life to start.

426
00:34:10,829 --> 00:34:13,229
l mean, Tino's coming. lt's way early.

427
00:34:14,833 --> 00:34:17,495
Look around, nobody is here yet.

428
00:34:22,674 --> 00:34:24,665
Look how thin yours are.

429
00:34:24,743 --> 00:34:26,506
Tino, where are you?

430
00:34:27,545 --> 00:34:29,536
But yours are really little.

431
00:34:30,181 --> 00:34:32,547
But they're fat, they're like fatter.

432
00:34:33,651 --> 00:34:35,642
Rickie loves cuter feet!

433
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:37,051
Me?

434
00:34:37,355 --> 00:34:39,346
Let's trade shoes.

435
00:34:47,866 --> 00:34:50,198
lf you were about to do it, okay...

436
00:34:50,268 --> 00:34:53,396
what would you want the other
person to say, like, right before?

437
00:34:53,471 --> 00:34:56,907
- 'This won't take long. '
- No, seriously.

438
00:34:58,376 --> 00:35:02,437
- ' Don't l know you? '
- No, for real, like romantic.

439
00:35:04,716 --> 00:35:10,211
'You're so beautiful,
it hurts to look at you. '

440
00:35:11,723 --> 00:35:13,350
' lt hurts to look at you? '

441
00:35:15,059 --> 00:35:17,050
How'd you think of that?

442
00:35:17,996 --> 00:35:19,623
Where would it hurt?

443
00:35:19,697 --> 00:35:21,688
l really like that.

444
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,630
Well l'm going to tell Jordan.

445
00:35:24,836 --> 00:35:26,827
Rayanne!

446
00:35:28,706 --> 00:35:31,197
Jordan! l'm going to tell Jordan.

447
00:35:40,251 --> 00:35:42,242
Could you get us in?

448
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,311
Our friend's in there,
he's got my keys.

449
00:35:44,389 --> 00:35:46,220
lt's an emergency.

450
00:35:46,925 --> 00:35:48,916
So what,
they wouldn't let you in?

451
00:35:49,894 --> 00:35:51,418
How old are you?

452
00:35:57,936 --> 00:35:59,927
You guys want to go somewhere?

453
00:36:00,004 --> 00:36:02,199
- Do you?
- l don't know.

454
00:36:02,273 --> 00:36:05,265
They are really young, isn't that
like kidnapping or something?

455
00:36:05,643 --> 00:36:06,974
Don't you?

456
00:36:07,111 --> 00:36:10,979
No, wait a minute, no.
Not three. J ust you, and you.

457
00:36:11,616 --> 00:36:13,846
l'm not leaving Rickie here.

458
00:36:13,918 --> 00:36:16,250
- Rickie don't mind.
- l don't mind.

459
00:36:19,457 --> 00:36:20,947
You.

460
00:36:22,126 --> 00:36:24,458
Come here, l want to

461
00:36:24,529 --> 00:36:26,190
Ask me from there.

462
00:36:26,798 --> 00:36:30,666
- l want to ask you over here.
- Come on, too young.

463
00:36:35,807 --> 00:36:39,709
l don't take orders,
and l'm not stupid.

464
00:36:40,245 --> 00:36:42,338
But you came when
l called, didn't you?

465
00:36:50,388 --> 00:36:54,722
<i>Somethlng was actually happenlng, </i>
<i>but lt was too actual, </i>

466
00:36:56,327 --> 00:36:58,818
- So where are we going?
- Come on, that's enough.

467
00:36:58,897 --> 00:37:00,194
Come on!

468
00:37:02,033 --> 00:37:04,365
Quit it! Let go of her!

469
00:37:05,003 --> 00:37:08,461
- What's your problem?
- Come on man. Let's go.

470
00:37:10,241 --> 00:37:13,404
Hey, l take care of myself! Okay?

471
00:37:14,679 --> 00:37:16,510
Oh man, you're dead!

472
00:37:16,581 --> 00:37:18,845
Forget it! Forget it!

473
00:37:19,684 --> 00:37:21,584
Come on, forget it.

474
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:25,785
She won't remember this tomorrow,
she blacks out when she drinks.

475
00:37:26,424 --> 00:37:28,551
- Hey!
- Let's just go.

476
00:37:29,193 --> 00:37:30,854
l got to go.

477
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:34,962
You know these girls?

478
00:37:41,706 --> 00:37:47,736
M r. Policeman. Perfect!
Because we need a ride.

479
00:37:49,314 --> 00:37:52,306
Relax. l'm not arresting you.

480
00:37:52,784 --> 00:37:55,776
Could you do the siren?
Please, please, please.

481
00:37:55,853 --> 00:37:57,787
Oh my God, Angela!

482
00:38:01,559 --> 00:38:03,550
Oh my God. Oh my--

483
00:38:05,396 --> 00:38:07,387
Hey, l know that girl.

484
00:38:08,266 --> 00:38:09,927
Oh my God!

485
00:38:11,235 --> 00:38:12,896
Angela!

486
00:38:33,891 --> 00:38:36,291
l knew what l was doing
back there, you know.

487
00:38:37,161 --> 00:38:38,822
Okay.

488
00:38:40,098 --> 00:38:45,695
l'll always watch out for you.

489
00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:49,934
Okay. l'll always
be there for you, so...

490
00:38:50,008 --> 00:38:51,999
don't worry, okay?

491
00:38:52,443 --> 00:38:53,933
l won't.

492
00:38:57,782 --> 00:39:02,242
And, you know, with
your hair like that?

493
00:39:03,287 --> 00:39:05,778
lt hurts to look at you.

494
00:39:10,962 --> 00:39:12,429
Come on.

495
00:39:21,305 --> 00:39:24,866
<i>At Rayanne's house, </i>
<i>no one was home, </i>

496
00:39:40,992 --> 00:39:43,483
Well, l never read the book.

497
00:39:43,661 --> 00:39:49,361
Oh, the book is really--
See, it's this diary of her life.

498
00:39:50,334 --> 00:39:53,667
See, these Nazis
were going to kill her, so...

499
00:39:53,738 --> 00:39:56,832
whatever she'd been like
with her friends or her teachers...

500
00:39:56,908 --> 00:40:01,845
that was just over.
She was hiding.

501
00:40:01,913 --> 00:40:05,781
But in this other way she wasn't.

502
00:40:05,850 --> 00:40:11,117
She, like, stopped hiding.
She was free.

503
00:40:17,528 --> 00:40:20,429
Don't do this again. You got that?

504
00:40:23,034 --> 00:40:25,628
Could you please not come to my door?

505
00:40:42,887 --> 00:40:44,218
Hey, you.

506
00:40:46,224 --> 00:40:49,489
- Are you a friend of hers?
- Yeah.

507
00:40:49,594 --> 00:40:51,425
Then act like it.

508
00:41:02,406 --> 00:41:05,068
Watch out for her.

509
00:41:11,916 --> 00:41:14,476
So, what happened?

510
00:41:25,763 --> 00:41:28,926
Right, you're not going to
tell me what happened. Chase?

511
00:41:31,435 --> 00:41:34,268
These guys started hitting on us.

512
00:41:34,338 --> 00:41:37,330
What? Like, sexual harassment?

513
00:41:39,010 --> 00:41:41,001
Like guys.

514
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:46,345
So they picked a theme, for yearbook.

515
00:41:50,822 --> 00:41:54,223
- Who told you l liked Jordan Catalano?
- Nobody.

516
00:41:54,959 --> 00:41:57,291
So do you?

517
00:42:05,469 --> 00:42:07,300
Angela.

518
00:42:37,501 --> 00:42:39,492
These aren't my shoes.

519
00:42:45,343 --> 00:42:50,679
lt's the Year 2000. That's the
theme. J ust, what it'll be like.

520
00:42:54,518 --> 00:42:55,644
Angela...

521
00:42:56,954 --> 00:42:58,444
l got to go.

522
00:42:59,023 --> 00:43:00,854
Okay.

523
00:43:07,865 --> 00:43:10,265
That's a pathetic theme.

524
00:43:10,334 --> 00:43:12,199
l know.

525
00:44:39,056 --> 00:44:43,789
H i. What happened to
spending the night?

526
00:44:48,799 --> 00:44:51,597
Well did you at least have fun?

527
00:44:53,137 --> 00:44:54,968
Sort of.

528
00:44:55,039 --> 00:44:57,371
How did you get home?

529
00:45:00,945 --> 00:45:02,936
Rayanne's mom.

530
00:45:06,083 --> 00:45:10,850
<i>My mother's adopted, For a whlle, </i>
<i>she was looklng for her real parents, </i>

531
00:45:14,558 --> 00:45:16,890
<i>l guess that's what</i>
<i>everyone's looklng for, </i>

532
00:45:23,334 --> 00:45:25,666
l'm really sorry.

533
00:45:35,513 --> 00:45:39,677
About my hair and everything.

534
00:45:50,027 --> 00:45:53,190
lt's not important, it'll grow out.

535
00:45:56,033 --> 00:46:00,970
lt actually looks not that bad...

536
00:46:03,207 --> 00:46:05,869
in my humble opinion.

537
00:46:12,216 --> 00:46:17,552
<i>l fell asleep rlght there, </i>
<i>l must've been really tlred, </i>

538
00:46:27,064 --> 00:46:29,328

- H i.

539
00:46:31,235 --> 00:46:34,227
- Out on bail?
- Yeah.

540
00:46:38,142 --> 00:46:40,303
So how was your weekend?

541
00:46:42,746 --> 00:46:44,737
lt sucked.

542
00:46:52,323 --> 00:46:54,154
l got to go.

543
00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:58,751
Rayanne, you are so full of it!

544
00:46:58,829 --> 00:47:01,821
Oh, please!
Ask Rickie, it was wicked. lt was--

545
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:04,864
- Oh, hey girlfriend!
- Hey Angela!

546
00:47:04,935 --> 00:47:07,267
Ask Angela, she was there.
Angela, tell her--

547
00:47:07,338 --> 00:47:09,329
We hung out and these guys
tried to pick them up.

548
00:47:09,406 --> 00:47:12,034
- lt was totally wicked, am l right?
- And the cops came.

549
00:47:12,109 --> 00:47:15,272
l am telling you,
we had a time. Didn't we?

550
00:47:15,346 --> 00:47:17,837
Didn't we have a time?

551
00:47:17,915 --> 00:47:20,907
We did. We had a time.
