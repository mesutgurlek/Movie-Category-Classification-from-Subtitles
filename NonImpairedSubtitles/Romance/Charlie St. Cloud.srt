this time, Tessy.

44
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:30,167
Next time.

45
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:33,901
Ooh, thank you.

46
00:03:34,867 --> 00:03:37,869
Charlie, l just
wanted to say great race.
You really closed out,

47
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:39,168
Thanks, man.

48
00:03:39,233 --> 00:03:41,001
Yeah. You know,

49
00:03:41,066 --> 00:03:42,834
in college races ,
St. Cloud

50
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,402
Yale-Stanford,
third race this season.

51
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,068
Mark it down on
your calendar, St. Cloud,

52
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:48,867
'cause that's when
l'm gonna smoke you.

53
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:56,035
Come on, Sam.
Don't look at me like that.

54
00:03:56,132 --> 00:03:59,001
Oh, l guess there are
some things you
can't buy, Connors.

55
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:01,834
Owned.

56
00:04:09,132 --> 00:04:11,133
Where do you think
they're going, Charlie?

57
00:04:12,066 --> 00:04:13,867
Everywhere, Sammy.

58
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:16,368
They're going everywhere.

59
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,702
Don't wory, that's
going to be us one day.

You and me, bud.
Setting sail at
sunset cannons,

61
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,834
It's not like it
would be the end of the world.
l'm just saying,

62
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:41,503
l could work for a year,
fill the coffers,
and then go to Stanford.

63
00:04:41,566 --> 00:04:43,668
You said yourself
it was too expensive,
even with the aid, Mom.

64
00:04:43,733 --> 00:04:46,368
l didn't say it
was too expensive.
l said it was expensive.

65
00:04:46,466 --> 00:04:49,869
Mom , I don't want you
having to work double shifts
at the hospital all the time.

66
00:04:49,967 --> 00:04:52,569
You got in fall,
so you go in fall.

67
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:56,503
You can't put life
on hold, Charlie.
It doesn't wait for you.

68
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,401

00:05:15,733 --> 00:05:19,303
Eveybody's dressed so fancy.

73
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:23,400
You look beautiful, Mom.

74

81
00:05:47,967 --> 00:05:49,034
Stop it.

Straighten up,
Iook sharp.

83
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,301
This suit's so lame.

Sammy!

85
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:01,500
Put me down, Sullivan!

86
00:06:01,566 --> 00:06:02,667
Sammy's on a rampage.

87
00:06:02,733 --> 00:06:04,167
Don't make me
hurt you, Green!

88
00:06:04,233 --> 00:06:05,801

Come on, come on, come on.

90
00:06:08,032 --> 00:06:09,500
You want to tap out?

We made it.
AIl right, All right.

92

Don't mess with me, Green.

101
00:06:56,299 --> 00:06:57,700
You're late.

102
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:00,534
Oh, yeah, l couldn't
find my glove.

103
00:07:00,633 --> 00:07:03,569
You're late, Sam.
Do you want to make

Yeah, l'm gonna try.

105

Yes, definitely, yes!

106
00:07:07,233 --> 00:07:08,867
'Cause l don't want to
waste my time here with you.

107
00:07:08,967 --> 00:07:10,635
Yes! Yes! Yeah!
Yeah?

108
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:13,335
Okay. Then l'Il
make a deal with you.

109
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:16,968
l'll practice with you
for one hour every day,

110
00:07:17,032 --> 00:07:19,467
right after l get off work,
up until l leave for Stanford.

111
00:07:22,366 --> 00:07:25,669
l'll meet you at
sunset cannons every day.

112
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:28,200
But if you keep me
waiting like this

113
00:07:28,299 --> 00:07:30,668
just one time,
the whole deal's off.

114
00:07:30,733 --> 00:07:32,167
No, l won't. l won't.

115
00:07:32,233 --> 00:07:33,467
You'd better not.

116
00:07:33,533 --> 00:07:35,635
No. l swear.
No, l won't,

117
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,034
Okay.

Fundamentals.
Get over here.

122
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:00,334
Put your hand out;
palms up.

123
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:01,533
you see these wide seams?

124
00:08:01,633 --> 00:08:02,867
Mmm-hmm.

125
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:05,467
That's the correct way
to hold a baseball.

126
00:08:05,533 --> 00:08:08,202
l didn't know l
was gonna get to go
to baseball camp this summer.

127
00:08:08,299 --> 00:08:10,734
That's because rich kids
go to camp, Sammy.

128
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:12,968
Do you have a trust fund
you're not telling me about?

129
00:08:13,032 --> 00:08:14,333
Not really. No.

130
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:15,466
No, you don't.

131
00:08:15,533 --> 00:08:17,401
But you know
what you do have?

132
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,168
Good looks?
No, you got me.

133
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,135
Get back over there.
Hustle,

134
00:08:24,566 --> 00:08:28,870
Hey. l pulled an extra shift.
You are on Sam duty,

135
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:30,301

Catchl Go!

142
00:08:46,733 --> 00:08:48,968
How could you let that go
between your legs?

143
00:08:49,032 --> 00:08:50,166
I could play
better than that!

144
00:08:50,233 --> 00:08:52,501
Hey, buddy,
your dinner's ready, okay?

145
00:08:52,566 --> 00:08:54,334
Sam, l'm putting
your dinner in the oven,
all right?

146
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:55,700
Okay!

What are you doing?
You're on Sam dutyl

151
00:09:29,633 --> 00:09:31,234
No one babysat me
when l was 11 , Sam.

152
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:32,701
Look, it's the
7th-inning stretch.

153
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,868
Can you please
just get me to Tommy's
by the bottom of the 8th?

154
00:09:34,967 --> 00:09:37,035
No. It's not exactly
on the way, Sam.

155
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,568
Sweet ride.

156
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:50,134
You're going out
like that?

157

Hey, keep an eye

162
00:10:12,132 --> 00:10:14,400
Hey, keep an eye
out for cops.

163
00:10:14,566 --> 00:10:15,967
Whatever.

164
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:18,000
Sammy! Cheer up.

165
00:10:19,566 --> 00:10:22,735
Come on, Sammy.
Sammy, baby.

166
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:25,668
You just can't wait,
can you?

167
00:10:25,733 --> 00:10:28,035
Sully and Green
Ieave for basic training
in a week.

168
00:10:28,132 --> 00:10:30,634
No, Charlie,

169
00:10:31,466 --> 00:10:34,535
Come on. l'm gonna
see you all the time.

170
00:10:36,533 --> 00:10:37,667
That's what Dad said.

171
00:10:37,733 --> 00:10:39,367
Yeah, but l'm not Dad.

172
00:10:40,066 --> 00:10:43,402
l'm not gonna ditch you, Sam.
l'm not gonna ditch you.

173
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:48,234
Cheer up, man.

174
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:51,335
Not an option.
You got one second
to cheer up.

175
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,968
You're lucky that
wasn't my throwing arm.

176
00:10:57,032 --> 00:10:58,566
Or what?

177
00:10:59,733 --> 00:11:01,034
l'd have to kick your ass.

178
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:07,700
Hey, what are you doing?

179
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,201
Ow! My nose!

180
00:11:09,299 --> 00:11:11,734
Shut your window, man.
l feel a draft.

181
00:11:12,199 --> 00:11:14,034
Dude. Watch it, punk.

182
00:11:14,366 --> 00:11:16,201
Calm down, l'm driving!
l'm driving, l'm driving!

183
00:11:16,299 --> 00:11:17,833
Sam! l'm driving!

184
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:30,567
Come on.

185
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:40,633
Charlie?

186
00:12:02,566 --> 00:12:04,034
Mom's gonna kill us!

187
00:12:04,566 --> 00:12:06,868
Don't worry,
l'll take the blame.

188
00:12:06,967 --> 00:12:08,401
God, l hurt so much.

189
00:12:11,533 --> 00:12:13,134
What's that?

190
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,234
They're looking for us.

191
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:16,901
Who?
l don't know.

192
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:18,500
Whatever happens, please,

193
00:12:18,566 --> 00:12:19,900

l won't.

194
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,335
Charlie.,. Charlie!

195
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,501
Charlie!

196
00:12:24,566 --> 00:12:26,401
I won't!

197
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:32,635
Give it up,
The kid's flatlined.
He's a lost cause.

198
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,701
There's no such thing
as a lost cause, Quiet.

199
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:39,068
Come on. Come on.

200
00:12:43,366 --> 00:12:44,667
My word.

201
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:50,069
Thank you, Jude.
Hey, Hey. Hey.

202
00:12:50,566 --> 00:12:52,200
Welcome back.
Where was l?

203
00:12:52,299 --> 00:12:53,533
lt's okay.
Where was l?

204
00:12:53,633 --> 00:12:55,401
You've just got to relax.
Where's Sam?

205
00:12:55,533 --> 00:12:57,568
Everything's okay,
but you gotta stay still.
Where's Sam?

206
00:12:57,666 --> 00:12:59,901
You got
to stay still. Okay?

207
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,535
Shh, Everything's okay.
Sam?

208
00:13:02,633 --> 00:13:03,900
Hey, Sam?

209
00:13:05,233 --> 00:13:07,902
Sam! Sam?
You've got to rest.

210
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,668
Come on, come on.

211
00:13:10,733 --> 00:13:13,469

213
00:13:18,366 --> 00:13:20,968
That's my brother! Sam!

214
00:13:22,566 --> 00:13:24,868
l can't leave him.
l can't leave him.

215
00:13:25,366 --> 00:13:28,235
Oh, my God,
l'm sory, Sam!

216
00:13:30,066 --> 00:13:33,502
No! Sam! l'm sorry, Sam.

217
00:13:41,132 --> 00:13:44,134
Dispatch, be advised, 351-BT,

218
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:46,067
One conscious, one DOA.

219
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,402
Through our Lord,
Jesus Christ.

220
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:53,302
God, whose mercies
cannot be numbered,

on behalf of the soul
of thy servant departed

222
00:13:57,533 --> 00:14:01,236
and grant him an entrance
into the land
of light and joy.

223
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:03,368
and the fellowship
of thy saints,

224
00:14:03,466 --> 00:14:05,835
through Jesus Christ,

Most merciful Father

228
00:14:16,066 --> 00:14:17,867
and who walk as
yet by faith.,.
Charlie.

229
00:14:17,967 --> 00:14:21,970
in glory everlasting,...
through Jesus Christ,
our Lord.

230
00:14:23,066 --> 00:14:24,567
Amen.

231
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:26,567
Charlie?

232
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,468
lf you want to drop
the glove in now?

233
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,234
l can't.

234
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:42,300
Charlie.

235
00:14:42,366 --> 00:14:44,134
l'm sory. l've got to go.

236
00:14:44,199 --> 00:14:45,400
Don't.

237
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:06,067
You're late.

238
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,868
l thought we had a deal.

239
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:15,000
We do.

240
00:16:16,132 --> 00:16:17,900
We do have a deal.

241
00:16:23,633 --> 00:16:27,636
We meet here evey day
at sunset cannons.

242
00:16:30,533 --> 00:16:31,800
promise?

243
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,234
l promise.

244
00:16:37,867 --> 00:16:39,201
l promise.

245
00:17:46,366 --> 00:17:49,335
Good morning,
Quincy. This is meteorologist
Banner Gwynne.

246
00:17:49,399 --> 00:17:50,867
Now, for all you
sallors out there,

247
00:17:50,967 --> 00:17:53,336
we have green flag wind
conditions this afternoon,

248
00:17:53,399 --> 00:17:55,567
so today is the day to
get out on the water.

249
00:19:05,533 --> 00:19:07,067
You all right, boss man?

250
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:08,333
Right. So them
geese are back,

251
00:19:08,399 --> 00:19:10,567
and they've done nasty things
to my grass again.

252
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:14,969
And they've crapped
over every headstone
in the whole place.

253
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:16,867
That one's the leader, Him.

254
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,168
Hmm, Do the best
you can with the grass.

255
00:19:21,233 --> 00:19:23,635
Yeah, well, the best
l can do is to shoot
the buggers, Charlie.

256
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,368
You want to run
around Seaside with
a rifle, Alistair?

257
00:19:25,466 --> 00:19:27,301
What about
a high-powered crossbow?

258
00:19:28,032 --> 00:19:30,367
You remember
Mr. Cosimono?

259
00:19:30,466 --> 00:19:32,868
We put him in
over Peach Tree Hill
about a month ago?

260
00:19:32,967 --> 00:19:34,568
Yeah, the dead guy,
Yeah.

261
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,668
He's coming up.
Why?

262
00:19:36,733 --> 00:19:41,003
Because the police suspect
his wife may be responsible
for his untimely demise.

263
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:45,203
You're joking.
l shouldn't laugh.
It's not funny,

264
00:19:45,299 --> 00:19:46,667
Oh! Speaking of
untimely demise,

265
00:19:46,733 --> 00:19:49,001
it's me and Cindy's
anniversary tomorrow night.

266
00:19:49,066 --> 00:19:50,801
We're going to Maddie's.
Want to come?

267
00:19:51,233 --> 00:19:52,801
Yeah, l'Il try.
Will you actually
ty, though?

268
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,301
'Cause last time
you said you'd try,

269
00:19:54,366 --> 00:19:55,667
you didn't really try,
did you, Charlie?

270
00:19:55,733 --> 00:19:56,900
You just ended
up staying here.

271
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,970
And this time,
Cindy has arranged
a little friend to meet you.

272
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:03,534
Are you even listening?
No, of course you're not.

273
00:20:03,633 --> 00:20:06,235
You got that glitch
in the sprinkler system
fixed, didn't you?

274
00:20:07,733 --> 00:20:09,835
That would be a no.
But it's not my
fault this time!

275
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,401
Don't look at me like that.
It's actually not my fault.

276
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:14,402
l called the sprinkler guy,
and he said he couldn't
come till next week.

277
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,001
So l was like,
''All right, cool.
Come next week,''

278
00:20:16,066 --> 00:20:18,368
But more important,
all right,
listen to me about this.

279
00:20:18,466 --> 00:20:19,867
Cindy's got this
mate over staying,

280
00:20:19,967 --> 00:20:22,669
and she is a waitress
at the Red Dog lnn.

281
00:20:22,733 --> 00:20:24,167
Charlie? The Red Dog Inn.

282
00:20:24,233 --> 00:20:26,201
You know about the
Red Dog Inn, don't you?
Mmm-hmm.

283
00:20:26,299 --> 00:20:28,334
AIl right. Okay.
So we've been
telling her about you,

284
00:20:28,399 --> 00:20:29,666
and she really wants
to meet you, all right?

285
00:20:29,733 --> 00:20:30,800
Hey!

286
00:20:30,867 --> 00:20:32,635
Who's got the green thumb?
What?

287
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:35,534
The garden around
my father's grave

288
00:20:35,633 --> 00:20:37,334
needs to be
completely replanted.

289
00:20:38,366 --> 00:20:39,400
And?

290
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,168
And maybe you could do it!

291
00:20:41,233 --> 00:20:42,968
Any flower preferences?
Yeah, living.

292
00:20:43,032 --> 00:20:45,401
l prefer living flowers.

293
00:20:49,366 --> 00:20:51,801
Good, l'll get right on that.

294
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:54,402
Yeah, that'll be great,

295
00:20:55,132 --> 00:20:57,133
getting flowers.

296
00:20:58,366 --> 00:21:00,000
Sorry. Thank you.

297
00:21:01,566 --> 00:21:02,667
Bye!

298
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,868
Anyway,
so she's a little
bit naughty,

299
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:10,135
a little bit saucy,
a little bit promiscuous.

300
00:21:10,199 --> 00:21:11,199
Mmm?

301
00:21:11,299 --> 00:21:14,402
The waitress, Charlie!
Please keep up, mate.
Red Dog Inn.

302
00:21:24,566 --> 00:21:27,902
Hey! Hey!

303
00:21:32,566 --> 00:21:33,900
Hey, buddy.

304
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:37,734
Hey, can you read signs?
No rubbingl

305
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:42,900
lf l was going
to rub one out,

306
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,068
l wouldn't do it in
a graveyard, St. Cloud.

307
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:52,068
People are always
tracing these headstones.

308
00:21:54,833 --> 00:21:56,568
Lieutenant Sullivan.

309
00:21:59,233 --> 00:22:00,367
Sir!

310
00:22:00,466 --> 00:22:01,733
At ease.

311
00:22:03,199 --> 00:22:05,367
You haven't changed,
St. Cloud,

312
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,001
How's your mom?

313
00:22:08,066 --> 00:22:09,500
She moved to Portland.

314
00:22:12,132 --> 00:22:13,733
Hey, were you here
when they brought Green in?

315
00:22:15,366 --> 00:22:18,202
Drove over a land mine.
He was a real mess,

316
00:22:18,733 --> 00:22:22,169
Not by the time l saw him.
Everybody looks great after.

317
00:22:23,299 --> 00:22:25,901
l'm glad to hear
there are some perks.

318
00:22:26,867 --> 00:22:29,135
Hey, what's with this stuff
all over the stone?

319
00:22:29,199 --> 00:22:32,402
lt's the geese, man.
There's something
corrosive in their shit.

320
00:22:33,199 --> 00:22:35,000
Don't worry, l'm on it.

321
00:22:35,066 --> 00:22:36,233
Thanks.

322
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,235
l wish l was there
with you guys,

323
00:22:49,533 --> 00:22:51,735
l'm glad you weren't,
Charlie,

324
00:22:52,833 --> 00:22:54,901
Yeah. l'm glad you weren't.

325
00:23:20,333 --> 00:23:22,802
You don't have
to go right away.

326
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,234
Got to face it sometime.

327
00:23:29,967 --> 00:23:33,036
AIl right.
l'Il say hi to
Sammy for you.

328
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,334
He's not there.

329
00:23:51,066 --> 00:23:52,567
l don't get it.

330
00:23:53,032 --> 00:23:54,366
He's totally cute.

331
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,834
Puppies are cute.

332
00:23:56,566 --> 00:23:58,834
He's weird.
He's misunderstood.

333
00:23:59,233 --> 00:24:00,901
He works in a graveyard!

334
00:24:01,466 --> 00:24:02,700
Yeah, wounded.

335
00:24:07,666 --> 00:24:08,800
Hey.

336
00:24:09,633 --> 00:24:10,700
Hi.

337
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,867
You're funny.

338
00:24:11,967 --> 00:24:13,034
$97.50.

339
00:24:15,066 --> 00:24:19,737
So, maybe you want to
take me out on your
boat sometime, Charlie?

340
00:24:22,199 --> 00:24:24,067
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

341
00:24:25,833 --> 00:24:27,634
l love sailing.

342
00:24:28,366 --> 00:24:29,467
Cool.

343
00:24:32,166 --> 00:24:34,368
Well, maybe
l can take you
out sometime, too.

344
00:24:34,466 --> 00:24:35,500
yeah!

345
00:24:35,566 --> 00:24:37,567
Enjoy your toy plane,
Charlie,

346
00:24:37,666 --> 00:24:39,034
lt's not for me.

347
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,735
lt's for the geese.

348
00:24:45,466 --> 00:24:47,034
So, what do you
wear on a sailing date?

349
00:24:47,132 --> 00:24:48,533
l wouldn't put too
much thought into it,

350
00:24:48,633 --> 00:24:51,736
seeing as he
hasn't been sailing
in five years.

351
00:25:50,733 --> 00:25:52,134
So, what's new in Quincy?

352
00:25:52,199 --> 00:25:53,400
Not much.

353
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,234
Man, you got it!

354
00:25:55,333 --> 00:25:56,333
Great, let's go
hit the lake,

355
00:25:56,399 --> 00:25:57,466
No. Not till
after practice.

356
00:25:57,533 --> 00:25:59,001
Back up, back up.
Get out of here.

357
00:25:59,066 --> 00:26:00,700
Please? Can we just go now?

358
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,134
What's our deal, Sam?

359
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:07,203
We practice evey
day at sunset cannons,

360
00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:09,000
come rain or shine,
come hell or high water.

361
00:26:09,066 --> 00:26:12,002
Yeah, that's the deal.
Let's go. Grounders.

362
00:26:20,566 --> 00:26:21,700
Nice.

363
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:25,467
What's wrong?

364
00:26:25,533 --> 00:26:27,201
Nothing,
Remember, two hands.

365
00:26:28,833 --> 00:26:31,335
Don't sit back
like that. Charge.

366
00:26:31,399 --> 00:26:32,900
Something bad.

367
00:26:35,833 --> 00:26:37,868
l didn't want to tell you.

368
00:26:39,299 --> 00:26:41,401
Sox lost a home-and-home
to the Yankees.

369
00:26:46,533 --> 00:26:48,201
l'm kidding, dork.

370
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,568
l saw Sully today.

371
00:26:59,132 --> 00:27:00,566
Did he say anything?

372
00:27:02,833 --> 00:27:04,301
About leaving?

373
00:27:04,366 --> 00:27:07,802
You know Sully.
l think he was good with it.

374
00:27:09,066 --> 00:27:11,368
I think he really
missed Green.

375
00:27:12,833 --> 00:27:14,401
l think l'd miss you.

376
00:27:15,533 --> 00:27:17,301
A little bit, Maybe.

377
00:27:18,733 --> 00:27:20,568
But you don't have to.

378
00:27:21,066 --> 00:27:23,001
Because we got
this thing wired,

379
00:27:23,733 --> 00:27:25,401
Yeah.

380
00:27:30,967 --> 00:27:32,902
AIl right, you ready?

381
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,534
Here they come.

382
00:27:35,199 --> 00:27:37,200
lt's about to get bloody.

383
00:27:46,066 --> 00:27:48,635
lncoming!
Whoa! Retreat!

384
00:28:40,333 --> 00:28:41,734
Excuse me.

385
00:28:42,166 --> 00:28:43,367
You all right? l'm sorry.

386
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:46,901
Oh, my Lord,

387
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,501
Charlie St, Cloud.

388
00:28:49,566 --> 00:28:50,566
Yeah.

389
00:28:50,666 --> 00:28:54,403
I brought you
back from the dead.
Does that ring a bell?

390
00:28:56,032 --> 00:28:58,334
You're the paramedic.
l'm the paramedic.

391
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:01,735
Florio Ferrente.
It's so good to see you.

392
00:29:02,566 --> 00:29:05,302
You want to grab
a cup of coffee?
Catch up?

393
00:29:05,366 --> 00:29:08,035
l can't, man.
l've got to get back to work.
l'm sory.

394
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:10,634
You can't have
a cup of coffee?

395
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:18,401
So, what.,.

396
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:22,335
What have you been up to
the past five years?

397
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:25,034
Are you in love?
You married?

398
00:29:25,366 --> 00:29:28,068
No. It hasn't happened yet.

399
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:29,333
No?

400
00:29:36,299 --> 00:29:37,700
You're sick.

401
00:29:39,533 --> 00:29:42,202
Yeah. l got the big C.

402
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:45,001
l'm sorry.

403
00:29:45,066 --> 00:29:46,400
Nah, don't be.

404
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:50,737
l have no regrets.
l lived a full life.

405
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:54,500
ls that really
a consolation?

406
00:29:55,967 --> 00:29:58,235
That's the only one
there is, Charlie.

407
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:02,303
Plus, l got to
witness a miracle.

408
00:30:03,833 --> 00:30:05,801
How many people can
say that to Saint Peter

409
00:30:05,867 --> 00:30:08,236
when they reach
the pearly gates? Huh?

410
00:30:09,199 --> 00:30:11,401
You were a
complete flatline.

411
00:30:12,733 --> 00:30:13,967
Nothing.

412
00:30:15,132 --> 00:30:16,533
And then.,.

413
00:30:24,066 --> 00:30:25,700
You must think about why.

414
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:29,833
Why what?

415
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:31,901
Why you?

416
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:36,903
Why did you get
a second chance?
God just doesn't show off.

417
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,970
There's got to be a reason
God gave you a second chance.

418
00:30:41,366 --> 00:30:44,469
Well, if there is one,
l haven't figured it out yet.

419
00:30:44,533 --> 00:30:46,067
Yeah, well.,.

420
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:49,569
l don't think it's
gonna come to you
working in a graveyard.

421
00:30:51,233 --> 00:30:52,901
You're a young man.

422
00:30:53,533 --> 00:30:56,669
You should be
out in the world
living your life,

423
00:30:57,166 --> 00:31:00,469
Don't squander this gift
you've been given.

424
00:31:42,199 --> 00:31:43,500
One of Quincy's own,

425
00:31:43,566 --> 00:31:45,834
she will seek to become
the youngest skipper ever

426
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:50,137
to compete in the grueling
VELUX 5 Oceans
race around the world.

427
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:53,135
Eveybody's excited,
This is a first for the town.

428
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:08,968
So, one of you
tie the main down.

429
00:32:09,032 --> 00:32:11,501
And l need
the cockpit tidied up.

430
00:32:11,566 --> 00:32:16,504
She was fully at whole speed
going downwind,
handled super light,

431
00:32:16,566 --> 00:32:18,501
No, whether l win
this race or not,

432
00:32:18,566 --> 00:32:20,801
let's hope that l do,
right, Tink?

433
00:32:20,867 --> 00:32:22,635
l mean, Coach?

434
00:32:22,733 --> 00:32:24,134
No, but whether
l win it or not,

435
00:32:24,199 --> 00:32:26,834
it will not be because
l didn't have a great boat.

436
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:29,168
Thank you so much, guys.

437
00:32:29,233 --> 00:32:31,368
That girl is gonna
sail around the world?

438
00:32:31,466 --> 00:32:32,834
Yeah.

439
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:40,335
Is that the girl?
She's hotI

440
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:41,666
She's all right.

441
00:32:41,733 --> 00:32:44,368
''All right''?
Is there a swimsuit shot
anywhere in there?

442
00:32:44,466 --> 00:32:45,667
What are you gonna do
with a swimsuit shot?

443
00:32:45,733 --> 00:32:47,134
Everything.

444
00:32:49,066 --> 00:32:50,200
Come on.
you want it?

445
00:32:50,299 --> 00:32:52,134
Give me the magazine.
Sam, you're gonna wreck it.

446
00:32:52,199 --> 00:32:54,968
l'm totally gonna wreck it.
l'm gonna wreck it repeatedly,
Charlie.

447
00:32:56,967 --> 00:32:58,535
''Tess Carroll,''

448
00:33:01,733 --> 00:33:04,735
Well done, Charlie. Mature.

449
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:08,201
You only left me
with the cover page.

450
00:34:07,366 --> 00:34:08,567
Charlie!

451
00:34:10,333 --> 00:34:13,002
l cannot believe
that you're here!

452
00:34:13,066 --> 00:34:14,467
Hello!
Hi.

453
00:34:15,733 --> 00:34:17,334
lt's our anniversary!
Yeah.

454
00:34:17,399 --> 00:34:20,168
No, not our anniversary,
because we're not going out,

455
00:34:20,233 --> 00:34:22,468
but me and Cindy's.

456
00:34:22,533 --> 00:34:24,234
l wouldn't miss
your anniversary, man.

457
00:34:24,333 --> 00:34:25,467
l know you wouldn't

458
00:34:25,566 --> 00:34:26,900
and it means a lot.
What's that?
Nothing.

459
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,034
You all right?
Yeah.

460
00:34:28,132 --> 00:34:31,502
What are you doing?
Doing a bit of drawing?

461
00:34:31,566 --> 00:34:35,236
Very nice, Come on inside.
It's gonna be well fun, mate.

462
00:34:35,333 --> 00:34:38,836
''This man's just got to go!''
declared his enemies

463
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:42,570
But the ladies begged
"Don't you tey
to do it, please"

464
00:34:42,666 --> 00:34:46,236
No doubt this Rasputin
hed iots of hidden charms

465
00:34:47,466 --> 00:34:49,334
Hey!
Hey, Cindy!

466
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:51,900
Happy anniversary,
Thanks.

467
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,535
He's really talented.
Oh, l know.

468
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:56,800
Come meet Rachel.

469
00:34:56,867 --> 00:34:58,501
Right now?
Yeah.

470
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:05,637
Rachel, this is Charlie,
the one l told you about.

471
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:07,334
Hi. Hey.

472
00:35:07,399 --> 00:35:09,000
Cindy said you wouldn't show.

473
00:35:09,066 --> 00:35:11,134
Only because we never see you
out at night, Charlie.

474
00:35:13,032 --> 00:35:17,970
Ever since the werewolf bite,
l tend to only come
out during full moons.

475
00:35:18,399 --> 00:35:20,200
The moon isn't full.

476
00:35:20,299 --> 00:35:22,401
Then I guess it's
your lucky night.

477
00:35:30,666 --> 00:35:32,667
Let's hear it for Cindy!

478
00:35:49,199 --> 00:35:50,233
Hey.

479
00:35:50,333 --> 00:35:52,034
How's the weather
looking, Coach?

480
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:56,703
Look. Low-pressure system
coming down from Alaska,

481
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,536
See how tight those isobars
are on the back
of the depression?

482
00:36:00,032 --> 00:36:01,366
Not good.

483
00:36:01,466 --> 00:36:02,800
That means more wind.

484
00:36:03,066 --> 00:36:05,668
Too much wind.
This test run can wait.

485
00:36:05,733 --> 00:36:07,835
The electronics
aren't even installed yet.

486
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,835
My boat gets shipped
back east in a week.

487
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,668
l need to get
out on the water.

488
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:14,135
Look, obviously l'Il
stay clear of the storm.

489
00:36:17,399 --> 00:36:19,234
Didn't you used to
be Charlie St. Cloud?

490
00:36:19,333 --> 00:36:22,969
Charlie! My man.
Been a long time, huh?

491
00:36:23,032 --> 00:36:25,234
Come on.
Jagerbombs, now.
Let's go.

492
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:32,336
Hey, why are you so
interested in that loon?

493
00:36:32,399 --> 00:36:33,900
l'm not.

494
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:36,501
l ran into him
for the first time

495
00:36:36,566 --> 00:36:38,134
since high school
the other day and.,.

496
00:36:38,199 --> 00:36:39,967
And?

497
00:36:40,032 --> 00:36:41,500
And he flummoxed me.

498
00:36:41,566 --> 00:36:45,369
Listen.
Eveybody in town knows
this St. Cloud kid,

499
00:36:47,166 --> 00:36:48,367
totally certifiable.

500
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:53,870
When we were growing up,
Charlie was unbeatable
on the water

501
00:36:53,967 --> 00:36:57,570
even got himself
a sailing scholarship
and eveything.

502
00:36:58,233 --> 00:36:59,968
Glory days,
huh, Charlie?

503
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:10,201
Hey.

504
00:37:12,132 --> 00:37:13,833
Hey.

505
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,635
No, that's okay, man.
l'm good. Thank you.

506
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:18,002
Come on, St. Cloud,
don't be a woman.
Have another.

507
00:37:18,066 --> 00:37:21,169
lt's not like there's
a big demand for you
as a designated driver.

508
00:37:21,233 --> 00:37:23,001
So take the drink.

509
00:37:25,299 --> 00:37:26,833
Wait, Charlie!

510
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:28,968
Come on, take it easy.
l'm fine.

511
00:37:29,032 --> 00:37:31,701
You want a piece of me,
you pathetic townie creep?

512
00:37:32,867 --> 00:37:35,236
Your boy just saved
you from a beating.

513
00:37:36,132 --> 00:37:37,900
No, you're probably right.

514
00:37:39,032 --> 00:37:42,001
l'm sory, man.
How is everything?
How's Goldman Sachs?

515
00:37:42,066 --> 00:37:43,734
I heard the layoffs
have been pretty brutal.

516
00:37:44,066 --> 00:37:46,001
Just a better opportunity
to weed out the weak.

517
00:37:46,066 --> 00:37:47,967
Yeah. But you're
good, right?

518
00:37:48,032 --> 00:37:49,400
You still have full
dental and everything?

519
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:50,634
Yeah.

520
00:39:01,833 --> 00:39:03,234
Hey!

521
00:39:05,733 --> 00:39:07,134
What are you doing?

522
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:08,900
l was just looking
at your boat.

523
00:39:11,066 --> 00:39:12,400
l'm sory if l scared you.

524
00:39:12,566 --> 00:39:13,967
You don't scare me.

525
00:39:17,733 --> 00:39:19,668
l'm harmless, l promise.
l'm not...

526
00:39:19,733 --> 00:39:21,167
Really?

527
00:39:21,366 --> 00:39:22,867
You didn't seem so
harmless up at Maddie's.

528
00:39:22,967 --> 00:39:26,003
Yeah, that.
l can explain that.

529
00:39:26,066 --> 00:39:27,467
Yeah?
Yeah.

530
00:39:29,199 --> 00:39:30,867
Connors is a dick.

531
00:39:31,967 --> 00:39:34,202
Yeah.
AIways has been.

532
00:39:40,733 --> 00:39:42,835
You don't
remember me, do you?

533
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:44,801
Yeah. Yeah, l do.

534
00:39:44,867 --> 00:39:46,368
You do?
l do.

535
00:39:47,032 --> 00:39:48,466
l already replanted
all the flowers

536
00:39:48,533 --> 00:39:51,068
by your father's grave.
No!

537
00:39:51,166 --> 00:39:52,567
High school.

538
00:39:53,399 --> 00:39:57,336
We took an AP class together.
And you don't remember.

539
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,167
Of course l remember you!

540
00:40:04,399 --> 00:40:05,566
You sat at the
front of the class.

541
00:40:06,733 --> 00:40:08,835
Had your hand up
the entire semester.

542
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:10,401
Busted.
Yeah.

543
00:40:11,066 --> 00:40:13,168
And you won
the Commodores' Cup.
Yeah.

544
00:40:13,233 --> 00:40:16,703
You got a big
sailing scholarship
to Stanford, right?

545
00:40:17,199 --> 00:40:18,567
l deferred.

546
00:40:19,733 --> 00:40:21,167
For a while.

547
00:40:27,566 --> 00:40:28,967
Anyways.,.

548
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:31,568
l should get going, l guess.

549
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:33,368
Yeah, it was.,.

550
00:40:34,833 --> 00:40:35,900
lt's good catching up.

551
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,034
Yeah.

552
00:40:51,233 --> 00:40:52,534
Flukes!

553
00:40:54,399 --> 00:40:55,867
Flukes?

554
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,668
Flukes.
Like a whale tail.
Uh-huh.

555
00:40:57,733 --> 00:40:59,468
Can l show you something?

556
00:40:59,533 --> 00:41:00,700
Yeah.

557
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:09,534
See, there's a.,.

558
00:41:10,466 --> 00:41:14,536
There's newer technology.
You can fabricate
organic lines.

559
00:41:15,166 --> 00:41:17,334
This would completely
change your boat,

560
00:41:17,399 --> 00:41:20,869
There's no drag.
There's virtually
no cavitation,

561
00:41:20,967 --> 00:41:24,403
Yeah. l know.
l wanted to do
something similar.

562
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:28,736
But everyone told me
structural stability
was more important.

563
00:41:28,833 --> 00:41:30,234
That doesn't apply here.

564
00:41:30,333 --> 00:41:31,400
Why?

565
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,203
Because this eliminates
direct stress on the keel.

566
00:41:35,299 --> 00:41:37,534
That's basic!
Are you serious?

567
00:41:38,733 --> 00:41:39,900
Sorry.

568
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:47,834
Anyways.,.

569
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:49,067
ls that my boat?

570
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:50,801
Yeah.

571
00:41:53,299 --> 00:41:54,700
You drew my boat.

572
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:55,901
Yeah.

573
00:41:56,566 --> 00:41:58,801
Good luck with the race,

574
00:42:00,299 --> 00:42:02,334
and be careful out there.

575
00:42:02,399 --> 00:42:03,800
Thank you.

576
00:42:38,733 --> 00:42:40,534
How's my girl?

577
00:42:40,633 --> 00:42:41,700
Bored.

578
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,801
Thet's what I like to hear.
Where are you?

579
00:42:43,867 --> 00:42:46,736
I was just
passing Whidbey Island,
heading into Puget Sound.

580
00:42:47,399 --> 00:42:49,234
Okay, good girl,
Keep going southeast.

581
00:42:49,333 --> 00:42:51,635
That storm's rolling in,
Iooking really haiy.

582
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:53,468
Aye-aye, Captain!

583
00:42:54,066 --> 00:42:55,167
Over.

584
00:42:57,299 --> 00:43:00,068
AIl right,
If you can't make it through
a little low-pressure system,

585
00:43:00,166 --> 00:43:02,801
then you have no right
being in that race,

586
00:43:02,867 --> 00:43:04,068
Come on!

587
00:43:09,132 --> 00:43:10,366
Come on.

588
00:43:11,666 --> 00:43:12,967
Come on.

589
00:43:13,032 --> 00:43:15,334
This is what
you were made for.

590
00:43:33,166 --> 00:43:38,804
The first leg is
an all-out 8,000-mile sprint
to Cape Town.

591
00:43:39,466 --> 00:43:41,000
Boom shaka-laka.

592
00:43:41,066 --> 00:43:44,002
l would kill that.
You would never catch me.

593
00:43:45,867 --> 00:43:47,034
Slider?

594
00:43:47,132 --> 00:43:49,033
No, I don't feel like
retrieving balls today.

595
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:54,336
See, rounding Cape Horn
is where it gets tricky,

596
00:43:54,399 --> 00:43:56,834
The southern seas are tough
for even the most
experienced sailors

597
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:58,901
because of the,..
Blood-sucking Sea-Monkeys.

598
00:44:01,233 --> 00:44:02,500
lcebergs.

599
00:44:03,032 --> 00:44:05,868
Of course, the
icebergs.

600
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:08,001
You could never
do this race.

601
00:44:08,066 --> 00:44:09,333
Why? Why can't
I do the raçe?

602
00:44:09,399 --> 00:44:13,136
lt's a solo race.
You couldn't take being
alone for six months.

603
00:44:13,199 --> 00:44:14,233
No way.

604
00:44:14,333 --> 00:44:15,333
l could do it.

605
00:44:15,399 --> 00:44:19,035
What? If it wasn't
for me, you could go?

606
00:44:19,132 --> 00:44:22,068
No, Sam, l didn't say that.
l just said l could.

607
00:44:22,867 --> 00:44:25,836
I won't, of course,
but I could.

608
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:27,868
Don't let me stop you.

609
00:44:28,299 --> 00:44:29,566
Oh!

610
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:32,969
Getting angry?
Trying to bring
the heat, Sam?

611
00:44:33,032 --> 00:44:36,068
The heat? Tha't not heat.
You want heat?

612
00:44:36,166 --> 00:44:38,501
Bring the heat, Sammy,
Let's go.

613
00:44:39,032 --> 00:44:41,067
So scared.

614
00:44:41,533 --> 00:44:43,234
Come on, Sam,
Falling asleep here.

615
00:44:52,132 --> 00:44:53,199
Oh!

616
00:44:55,399 --> 00:44:56,733
You okay?

617
00:44:58,633 --> 00:44:59,834
Oh!

618
00:45:00,166 --> 00:45:01,400
Strike.

619
00:45:04,032 --> 00:45:06,968
Did you see that?
There's lightning!

620
00:45:11,399 --> 00:45:14,235
Let the Mud Games begin!
Let the Mud Games begin!

621
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:30,234
Hey, guys.

622
00:46:32,032 --> 00:46:34,667
How long are we
gonna do this for? Hmm?

623
00:46:35,733 --> 00:46:37,401
This isn't a game.

624
00:46:40,233 --> 00:46:42,368
Get out of here!
Get out of here!

625
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:44,968
God, what the hell
are you doing?

626
00:46:45,466 --> 00:46:47,067
Hi.
Hi.

627
00:46:50,633 --> 00:46:55,471
l'm sory about the noise.
l apologize.
l just got carried away,

628
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:02,070
Hey! You did a lovely
job with the flowers,

629
00:47:02,867 --> 00:47:06,036
No, I'm fine.
I just hit some
rough weather last night.

630
00:47:06,666 --> 00:47:08,167
Have you had
that looked at?

631
00:47:08,233 --> 00:47:09,467
What?

632
00:47:10,399 --> 00:47:14,002
No, It's fine. I just
need some sleep. I'm fine.

633
00:47:14,066 --> 00:47:16,201
l could clean it up for you
and see if it needs a stitch.

634
00:47:16,666 --> 00:47:19,535
lt's pretty...
It's kind of gross.

635
00:47:21,967 --> 00:47:23,902
l'm right down the hill.

636
00:47:25,299 --> 00:47:27,000
A little sting now.

637
00:47:27,066 --> 00:47:28,400
Is it fatal?

638
00:47:30,166 --> 00:47:31,534
Definitely.

639
00:47:33,666 --> 00:47:34,900
AIl done.

640
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,568
You don't need stitches.

641
00:47:38,666 --> 00:47:40,401
Not a stitch?
No

642
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:54,501
It was a drunk driver
wasn't it?

643
00:47:54,566 --> 00:47:56,167
l'm sory. What?

644
00:47:57,032 --> 00:47:58,500
Your brother.

645
00:47:58,566 --> 00:48:02,803
ls that why you
gave up sailing,
Stanford, eveything?

646
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,735
Christ, that was tactless.
l'm sory.

647
00:48:07,833 --> 00:48:10,001
l must be concussed
or something.

648
00:48:10,066 --> 00:48:11,300
No. No.

649
00:48:12,633 --> 00:48:16,336
Maybe we could talk.
Another time.

650
00:48:17,233 --> 00:48:19,501
Yeah. Yeah, l'd like that.

651
00:48:20,333 --> 00:48:24,870
l'd like to talk with
you sometime, Charlie.
Yeah, maybe when l get back.

652
00:48:27,867 --> 00:48:29,501
ln six months.

653
00:48:44,833 --> 00:48:46,801
Come on,
l can do this.

654
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:48,967
l can do this.

655
00:49:02,333 --> 00:49:05,169
Hey! Hey.

656
00:49:08,132 --> 00:49:09,299
l know how to cook.

657
00:49:09,366 --> 00:49:10,734
Yeah?

658
00:49:11,233 --> 00:49:14,502
I mean, would you please
have dinner with me tonight?

659
00:49:14,566 --> 00:49:16,000
At my place?

660
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:19,135
Charlie, in a few days
l'm going to get in my boat

661
00:49:19,233 --> 00:49:21,635
and sail away
for six months.
Six months.

662
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:24,702
So, not really much
of a prospect, am l?

663
00:49:27,533 --> 00:49:29,167
Are you a good cook?

664
00:49:29,233 --> 00:49:30,467
Excellent.

665
00:49:33,666 --> 00:49:35,134
Beer or wine?

666
00:49:38,867 --> 00:49:40,301
Surprise me.

667
00:49:40,633 --> 00:49:41,834
Okay.

668
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:44,535
AIl right, l will.

669
00:49:44,633 --> 00:49:46,234
Well, you have to
make her pizza,

670
00:49:48,299 --> 00:49:50,234
Okay.
What? pizza's delicious.

671
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:52,802
l'm not arguing.
l think pizza is delicious.

672
00:49:52,867 --> 00:49:54,368
Good.

673
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:05,236
Remember me telling you
that l kissed Jenny York?

674
00:50:07,066 --> 00:50:08,167
Yeah.

675
00:50:11,233 --> 00:50:13,835
Well, l lied.

676
00:50:19,399 --> 00:50:20,566
Hey.

677
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:24,035
Believe me,
you're not missing much.

678
00:50:31,566 --> 00:50:33,234
ls she a Sox fan?

679
00:50:34,967 --> 00:50:36,301
Absolute fanatic.

680
00:50:37,132 --> 00:50:38,466
Really?

681
00:50:38,566 --> 00:50:40,534
l hate baseball.
You're insane.

682
00:50:40,833 --> 00:50:41,833
You don't agree?

683
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:43,067
Well.,.

684
00:50:43,233 --> 00:50:44,500
lt's so boring!

685
00:50:44,566 --> 00:50:45,833
Agree to disagree.

686
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:48,702
Come on,
They stand around
for nine innings,

687
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:50,468
and they don't do.,.
What about golf?

688
00:50:50,533 --> 00:50:52,334
Golf?
Yeah, or shopping?

689
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:55,068
Football. That's my sport.

690
00:50:55,166 --> 00:50:56,967
Oh, come on.
Oh, please!

691
00:50:57,032 --> 00:50:58,366
No way,
Yes!

692
00:50:58,466 --> 00:51:00,000
You didn't strike me
as one of those chicks

693
00:51:00,066 --> 00:51:01,500
who likes neckless
'roid-heads,

694
00:51:01,566 --> 00:51:02,700
Well, l do.

695
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:04,067
Come on, hairier
the better.

696
00:51:04,166 --> 00:51:06,167
yeah. More wine?

697
00:51:06,867 --> 00:51:08,368
Yes, please.

698
00:51:24,166 --> 00:51:25,700
Are you moving?

699
00:51:27,132 --> 00:51:29,234
No, that's all Sam's stuff.

700
00:51:30,633 --> 00:51:33,635
I couidn't get rid of
my ded's stuff, either.

701
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:39,002
This one over
here contains

702
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:42,869
thousands of vintage
Red Sox baseball cards.

703
00:51:42,967 --> 00:51:44,468
Really?
Yeah.

704
00:51:45,132 --> 00:51:48,301
Why the obsession
with a team from Boston?

705
00:51:48,399 --> 00:51:49,466
According to Sammy,

706
00:51:49,533 --> 00:51:51,334
our dad played
for the Red Sox.

707
00:51:52,233 --> 00:51:53,634
Did he?
No.

708
00:51:55,066 --> 00:51:58,169
He tried out for
the Triple-A team
in Pawtucket.

709
00:51:59,399 --> 00:52:01,634
That was the last
we saw of him.

710
00:52:09,466 --> 00:52:10,900
Can l have that
sketch someday?

711
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:28,234
lt's yours now.

712
00:52:30,666 --> 00:52:31,867
Thanks.

713
00:52:34,566 --> 00:52:37,001
So, l haven't shown
you my route.

714
00:52:37,666 --> 00:52:38,833
You're limping.

715
00:52:40,233 --> 00:52:41,734
Yeah, l told you,

716
00:52:41,833 --> 00:52:44,902
l got tossed
around pretty good
on my last sail.

717
00:52:45,233 --> 00:52:47,568
So l'm starting in Boston,

718
00:52:48,233 --> 00:52:51,069
and then l'm going
to make my way south

719
00:52:51,399 --> 00:52:53,067
towards Brazil.

720
00:52:55,666 --> 00:52:57,634
And then l'm going to go

721
00:53:02,466 --> 00:53:04,467
through the.,.

722
00:53:11,233 --> 00:53:14,502
Charlie, what are we doing?

723
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:16,968
l don't know.

724
00:53:17,066 --> 00:53:19,234
No, l.., Charlie.,.

725
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:22,901
l leave in a week.

726
00:53:24,233 --> 00:53:25,367
l know.

727
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:27,800
l think l should go.

728
00:53:29,967 --> 00:53:31,468
Can l walk you?

729
00:53:31,833 --> 00:53:33,034
No.

730
00:53:33,299 --> 00:53:35,334
Come on, let me walk you.
No, Charlie.

731
00:53:37,733 --> 00:53:39,234
Timing,

732
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:43,735
it really is eveything.

733
00:53:45,233 --> 00:53:46,567
l'm sorry.

734
00:54:12,366 --> 00:54:13,467
Tess?

735
00:54:16,399 --> 00:54:17,500
Tess!

736
00:54:18,833 --> 00:54:20,301
Come find me!

737
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:02,301
l found you.

738
00:56:36,733 --> 00:56:37,867
What are these?

739
00:56:39,299 --> 00:56:40,667
Burn marks.

740
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:44,335
lt's where the paramedic
shocked me.

741
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:49,500
They're beautiful.

742
00:56:49,566 --> 00:56:50,733
Hardly.

743
00:56:51,833 --> 00:56:52,900
Hey.

744
00:56:54,466 --> 00:56:56,234
They saved your life.

745
00:56:57,800 --> 00:56:59,468
They're beautiful.

746
00:57:27,066 --> 00:57:29,234
This doesn't
change anything.

747
00:58:01,299 --> 00:58:03,067
l knew you'd find me!

748
00:58:19,066 --> 00:58:20,400
Here we go!

749
00:58:27,066 --> 00:58:28,667
Hike! Hike hard!

750
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,401
lt's choppy.

751
00:58:36,967 --> 00:58:38,201
Whoa, hey!

752
00:58:40,733 --> 00:58:41,900
Thank you.

753
00:58:42,399 --> 00:58:43,500
For what?

754
00:58:43,566 --> 00:58:44,700
For this.

755
00:58:46,666 --> 00:58:48,567
Stand by to come about!

756
00:58:48,733 --> 00:58:50,401
Aye-aye, Captain!

757
00:58:55,900 --> 00:58:57,901
Sorry.
It's been a while.

758
00:58:59,466 --> 00:59:01,334
lt won't happen again.

759
00:59:06,399 --> 00:59:09,135
''trust your heart
if the seas catch fire

760
00:59:10,233 --> 00:59:13,035
''and live by love..,''
''by love though
the stars walk backward''

761
00:59:17,666 --> 00:59:18,800
How did you know that?

762
00:59:19,166 --> 00:59:20,901
l heard you read it.

763
00:59:22,566 --> 00:59:24,834
Were you at my
father's memorial?

764
00:59:28,466 --> 00:59:29,567
Oh, my God.

765
00:59:33,633 --> 00:59:35,368
lt's E.E. Cummings.

766
00:59:36,132 --> 00:59:38,133
lt was my dad's favorite.

767
00:59:40,566 --> 00:59:42,167
l like it a lot.

768
00:59:43,066 --> 00:59:44,667
l don't understand it at all.

769
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,035
lt's about taking chances.

770
00:59:51,466 --> 00:59:53,367
Sailing around the world.

771
00:59:56,233 --> 00:59:58,168
l wish you could
come with me,

772
00:59:59,967 --> 01:00:01,301
lt's a solo race.

773
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:04,502
So you could be part
of my support team,

774
01:00:04,566 --> 01:00:06,067
l could see you
for a couple days.

775
01:00:06,166 --> 01:00:07,567
l can't.

776
01:00:08,666 --> 01:00:11,468
Why? Come on,
you don't have
any holidays?

777
01:00:11,967 --> 01:00:13,401
l just can't.

778
01:00:15,366 --> 01:00:16,900
You just can't.

779
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:22,368
l just can't.

780
01:00:27,199 --> 01:00:28,700
Oh, shit.
What?

781
01:00:29,233 --> 01:00:30,801
Nothing.
l left something at work.

782
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,334
What? Well, hold on,
l'll come with you,

783
01:00:32,399 --> 01:00:33,733
No. l won't be long.

784
01:00:34,066 --> 01:00:35,333
l'll meet you at the cottage.

785
01:00:44,399 --> 01:00:45,900
Sam. Sam!

786
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:49,001
Stop!

787
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:51,334
Sam, stop!

788
01:00:53,967 --> 01:00:55,335
You're late.

789
01:00:55,399 --> 01:00:56,733
l couldn't.,.

790
01:00:57,733 --> 01:00:59,701
l couldn't help it, Sam.

791
01:01:00,032 --> 01:01:01,566
l knew you'd be late.

792
01:01:03,066 --> 01:01:06,035
l could.., l could
feel you forgetting me.

793
01:01:06,967 --> 01:01:08,368
No, Sam.

794
01:01:09,333 --> 01:01:10,734
lt's like,

795
01:01:12,132 --> 01:01:13,566
without you,

796
01:01:14,399 --> 01:01:17,802
l feel myself
start to disappear.

797
01:01:21,399 --> 01:01:22,733
Be nothing.

798
01:01:24,967 --> 01:01:27,169
There's nothing to
be scared of, Sam.

799
01:01:27,233 --> 01:01:28,500
Do you want me to go?

800
01:01:28,566 --> 01:01:29,667
No.

801
01:01:29,733 --> 01:01:31,501
Then why did you
bring her?

802
01:01:34,633 --> 01:01:36,735
l didn't mean
to spy on you.

803
01:01:39,233 --> 01:01:41,468
Charlie, it's okay.

804
01:01:47,166 --> 01:01:48,667
Sam and l made a deal.

805
01:01:49,066 --> 01:01:50,834
Charlie, you don't
have to explain
anything to me.

806
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:52,401
No, we made a,..
We made a pact.,.
You don't.

807
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:54,235
..,that evey day at sunset
l would meet him here.

808
01:01:54,333 --> 01:01:55,400
Charlie.

809
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,901
l can't lose Sam, Tess.

810
01:02:02,633 --> 01:02:04,234
l can't lose Sam.

811
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:08,001
Let's go.

812
01:02:08,066 --> 01:02:09,567
No.
Let's go.

813
01:02:11,399 --> 01:02:14,468
The more l'm in your world,
the less l can be in his.

814
01:02:16,666 --> 01:02:19,668
Charlie, at some point
we all have to let go.

815
01:02:24,233 --> 01:02:26,168
l can't lose Sam, Tess.

816
01:02:36,666 --> 01:02:38,167
Goodbye, Tess.

817
01:02:41,233 --> 01:02:43,201
Good luck with the race.

818
01:02:44,900 --> 01:02:47,736
You didn't die in
that car crash, Charlie.

819
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:56,068
Actually, l did.

820
01:03:09,466 --> 01:03:12,535
l can't come to
Cape Town because

821
01:03:13,199 --> 01:03:16,835
evey evening l play catch
with my dead brother

822
01:03:18,132 --> 01:03:19,733
in the graveyard.

823
01:03:22,299 --> 01:03:25,068
But l'll be here
when you get back, Tess.

824
01:03:26,132 --> 01:03:27,867
Because, of course,

825
01:03:28,900 --> 01:03:30,401
l never leave.

826
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:48,233
You.

827
01:03:50,566 --> 01:03:52,801
Come on.
Let's go for a walk.

828
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:55,334
Bobbo! Come here!

829
01:03:56,199 --> 01:03:57,300
Hey!

830
01:04:05,566 --> 01:04:06,733
Hello?

831
01:04:08,333 --> 01:04:09,567
Charlie?

832
01:04:09,900 --> 01:04:12,969
l never can tell
if your machine
has picked up.

833
01:04:13,399 --> 01:04:14,900
it's your mom.

834
01:04:17,633 --> 01:04:19,534
I just reaily miss you.

835
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:23,035
Give me a call sometime,
okay?

836
01:04:23,333 --> 01:04:24,701
I love you.

837
01:04:25,900 --> 01:04:27,201
Bye.

838
01:04:46,900 --> 01:04:48,868
You all right,
boss Man?

839
01:04:50,967 --> 01:04:52,802
You look dirty, mate.
What happened to you?

840
01:04:54,166 --> 01:04:56,568
Please say you
got laid at least.

841
01:04:58,733 --> 01:05:00,835
ls that a no, is it?
Oh, well.

842
01:05:01,566 --> 01:05:03,000
Thanks, babes.

843
01:05:05,833 --> 01:05:07,134
Can l have your attention?

844
01:05:08,233 --> 01:05:09,400
Bobbo!

845
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,001
Julie, can you get Bobbo?

846
01:05:13,399 --> 01:05:14,500
Julie!

847
01:05:16,199 --> 01:05:17,366
Julie?

848
01:05:25,066 --> 01:05:27,301
We've got a boat missing out
of Quincy Harbor.

849
01:05:28,233 --> 01:05:29,367
Whose boat?

850
01:05:30,967 --> 01:05:34,203
lt's the Querencia.
Tess Carroll's boat.

851
01:05:35,566 --> 01:05:38,035
She was out sailing
during the storm
three days ago,

852
01:05:38,199 --> 01:05:39,967
There's been no
contact since.

853
01:05:40,399 --> 01:05:42,567
She was out sailing
during the storm
three days ago.

854
01:05:42,833 --> 01:05:46,369
Three days ago.

855
01:05:46,466 --> 01:05:47,967
Is it fatal?

856
01:05:48,032 --> 01:05:50,501
l just hit some
rough weather last night.

857
01:05:50,566 --> 01:05:54,002
Yeah, I got tossed
around pretty good
on my last sail.

858
01:05:58,833 --> 01:06:00,134
The Coast Guard's
overextended,

859
01:06:00,199 --> 01:06:02,334
so we're asking for volunteers
to join the search.

860
01:06:13,066 --> 01:06:14,567
lt's too late.

861
01:06:40,566 --> 01:06:41,667
Tess?

862
01:06:45,032 --> 01:06:46,133
Tess?

863
01:06:50,299 --> 01:06:53,468
Why are you the only one
who can see me, Charlie?

864
01:06:56,900 --> 01:06:59,469
I can see you
because I can see Sam.

865
01:07:09,299 --> 01:07:10,667
Sam's dead.

866
01:07:11,867 --> 01:07:13,868
Your boat never
came back, Tess.

867
01:07:17,166 --> 01:07:18,901
You never came back.

868
01:07:20,066 --> 01:07:21,133
No, l.,.

869
01:07:21,366 --> 01:07:23,134
You're in between now.

870
01:07:23,900 --> 01:07:25,635
No, l lied to Tink.

871
01:07:26,299 --> 01:07:28,034
l lied to him. l.,.

872
01:07:28,466 --> 01:07:30,234
I sailed stralght
into the storm.

873
01:07:31,132 --> 01:07:33,801
l remember,.. l remember
l saw the old
Cape Flattery light.

874
01:07:33,867 --> 01:07:35,835
Everyone sees the light.

875
01:07:36,900 --> 01:07:38,401
No, you didn't.,.

876
01:07:38,633 --> 01:07:40,735
l've seen that light, Tess.

877
01:07:41,399 --> 01:07:44,034
Charlie, l'm getting cold.
l'm scared.

878
01:07:48,233 --> 01:07:50,068
l wanted you to find me.

879
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:52,868
That's why.,.
That's why l came here,

880
01:07:52,967 --> 01:07:55,002
'cause l wanted
you to find me.

881
01:07:55,066 --> 01:07:57,835
You were supposed to find me,
because you're
supposed to help me.

882
01:07:57,900 --> 01:07:59,368
You were supposed to find me.

883
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:02,169
I cannot be dead.
Please, Charlie, find me.

884
01:08:02,233 --> 01:08:03,567
Tess!

885
01:08:14,967 --> 01:08:16,234
Tess!

886
01:09:34,399 --> 01:09:36,367
She's dead, that girl.

887
01:09:39,900 --> 01:09:41,234
Tess.

888
01:09:45,299 --> 01:09:47,734
She took a boat
out in that storm.

889
01:09:49,066 --> 01:09:50,233
She...

890
01:09:52,466 --> 01:09:54,234
She never came back.

891
01:10:08,299 --> 01:10:09,900
You still got me.

892
01:10:15,233 --> 01:10:16,901
Yeah, l know, man.

893
01:10:19,900 --> 01:10:21,067
l know.

894
01:10:54,967 --> 01:10:56,034
Mr. St, Cloud?

895
01:10:56,132 --> 01:10:57,299
l'm not on duty.

896
01:10:57,900 --> 01:10:59,534
This is
a personal matter.

897
01:10:59,900 --> 01:11:03,069
l'm Carla Ferrente.
Florio was my husband.

898
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,569
l tried calling
earlier. He..,

899
01:11:07,900 --> 01:11:09,635
He died last night.

900
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:13,536
Florio wanted you to
have his medallion.

901
01:11:18,700 --> 01:11:19,901
Are you sure?

902
01:11:21,233 --> 01:11:24,169
l'm sure. He said it
was the answer for you.

903
01:11:27,900 --> 01:11:29,167
To what?

904
01:11:30,066 --> 01:11:31,400
''Why you?''

905
01:11:33,399 --> 01:11:34,733
That's it?

906
01:11:35,466 --> 01:11:36,800
That's it.

907
01:11:39,333 --> 01:11:41,568
l've never seen one of
these without a cross.

908
01:11:42,132 --> 01:11:44,067
lt's not Christ,
It's Saint Jude.

909
01:11:44,566 --> 01:11:47,035
Jude is the saint
of all lost causes.

910
01:11:47,500 --> 01:11:49,835
There's no such thing
as a lost cause.

911
01:11:50,466 --> 01:11:51,667
Yeah.

912
01:11:51,733 --> 01:11:55,736
Well, that's what my Florio
used to always say.

913
01:12:34,666 --> 01:12:36,234
God just doesn't show off.

914
01:12:36,366 --> 01:12:40,403
There's got to be a reason
God gave you a second chance.

915
01:12:42,366 --> 01:12:43,967
You're not dead.

916
01:12:45,032 --> 01:12:48,335
I just really
hate geese, mate.
I just hate them.

917
01:12:48,399 --> 01:12:50,067
They're dirty,
they crap everywhere.

918
01:12:50,166 --> 01:12:51,400
Where's Tink?

919
01:12:53,032 --> 01:12:54,900
You fueled up? Let's go.

920
01:12:55,333 --> 01:12:56,834
What are you doing, man?
Hey, hey!

921
01:12:56,900 --> 01:12:59,802
Get your hands off my boat!
In case you haven't heard,

922
01:12:59,867 --> 01:13:01,168
the Coast Guard
called off the search.

923
01:13:01,233 --> 01:13:03,168
Well, then give me your keys.
l'm taking your boat.

924
01:13:03,233 --> 01:13:04,367
The hell you are.

925
01:13:04,967 --> 01:13:06,234
l know
where she is, Tink.
Do you?

926
01:13:06,366 --> 01:13:08,067
l know where she is!
That's it, whack jobI

927
01:13:08,166 --> 01:13:10,368
Go back to your
coffin before l.,.

928
01:13:10,466 --> 01:13:11,834
l know where
Tess is, Tink!

929
01:13:11,900 --> 01:13:13,234
And she's running
out of time!
Charlie! Shut up!

930
01:13:13,333 --> 01:13:14,567
Charlie! Go.
Go back inside.

931
01:13:14,666 --> 01:13:15,833
He's not worth it.
She's running out of time!

932
01:13:15,900 --> 01:13:17,067
Tink, we're going,
all right?

933
01:13:20,066 --> 01:13:21,834
What are you doing?

934
01:13:24,366 --> 01:13:26,034
Sorry about that.

935
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:29,636
The key's in the ignition,
all right? Go.

936
01:13:30,399 --> 01:13:31,733
Go, go, go, go, go, Quick!

937
01:13:38,299 --> 01:13:40,567
Go, go, go, go! Go!

938
01:13:41,366 --> 01:13:42,467
Stop right now!

939
01:13:43,366 --> 01:13:45,067
I don't think
he's gonna make it.

940
01:13:45,166 --> 01:13:46,867
you son of a bitch!

941
01:13:48,733 --> 01:13:50,067
Oh, he made it.

942
01:13:50,166 --> 01:13:51,367
Stay down,
stay down, stay down.

943
01:13:51,466 --> 01:13:52,800
You frigging nutjob!

944
01:13:52,867 --> 01:13:54,068
Relax, relax.
Calm down, all right?

945
01:13:54,199 --> 01:13:55,800
Calm down!
Where are you two
taking my boat?

946
01:13:55,867 --> 01:13:56,901
Cape Flattery.

947
01:13:57,299 --> 01:13:59,834
That's 20 miles
from Tess' last
known position.

948
01:13:59,900 --> 01:14:01,534
But it's exactly
where she would have been

949
01:14:01,633 --> 01:14:03,368
if she sailed straight
into the storm, Tink!

950
01:14:03,466 --> 01:14:05,067
She's about to
sail around the world.

951
01:14:05,399 --> 01:14:07,834
She would have
wanted to test her boat
in heavy weather,

952
01:14:07,900 --> 01:14:09,234
You didn't even
know her, St. Cloud.

953
01:14:09,333 --> 01:14:11,334
How could you possibly know
what she would have done?

954
01:14:11,399 --> 01:14:13,567
Because it's what
l would have done, Tink.

955
01:14:14,032 --> 01:14:16,067
That's what any
sailor would do.

956
01:14:16,566 --> 01:14:17,867
l'm good. l'm good.
You all right?

957
01:14:17,967 --> 01:14:18,967
l'm gonna let
you up, all right?

958
01:14:19,032 --> 01:14:20,032
Relax.

959
01:14:20,132 --> 01:14:23,001
All right. AIl right,
Charlie. Say you're right.

960
01:14:23,533 --> 01:14:26,168
Say she wanted to
test the boat. Okay?

961
01:14:26,233 --> 01:14:27,334
It doesn't matter

962
01:14:27,399 --> 01:14:29,167
'cause we both know
that no one can survive

963
01:14:29,233 --> 01:14:30,500
for three days in
these cold waters.

964
01:14:30,566 --> 01:14:33,068
Just listen to me, Tink.

965
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:35,201
She's alive.

966
01:14:36,333 --> 01:14:37,734
She's alive.

967
01:14:41,466 --> 01:14:43,134
She's alive, Tink.

968
01:15:01,333 --> 01:15:02,667
Flattery Light!

969
01:15:32,733 --> 01:15:34,367
What time is it?

970
01:15:35,166 --> 01:15:36,367
Midday.

971
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:39,534
We've covered eveything
up to Spike Rock,

972
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:43,203
Let me grab the wheel.
Come on, l got it,

973
01:15:43,500 --> 01:15:45,335
lt's my boat.
l know what to do. Come on.

974
01:15:45,566 --> 01:15:46,800
Come on.

975
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:49,735
Keep your eyes open.

976
01:15:49,833 --> 01:15:51,334
Get some rest.

977
01:16:18,633 --> 01:16:22,336
lf we start now,
we could make it back
to Quincy by sunset,

978
01:16:28,633 --> 01:16:31,736
What is it you do
in the woods
every night, man?

979
01:16:35,032 --> 01:16:37,234
lf l told you,
you wouldn't.,.

980
01:16:38,867 --> 01:16:40,368
You wouldn't believe me.

981
01:16:40,466 --> 01:16:41,900
l would believe you.

982
01:16:42,399 --> 01:16:43,967
You're my mate.

983
01:16:57,967 --> 01:17:00,803
You know, she might
not even be out there.

984
01:17:04,132 --> 01:17:06,133
What's up, Charlie?

985
01:17:06,199 --> 01:17:09,135
We going back?
Or are we moving on?

986
01:17:16,066 --> 01:17:18,001
l'm going to find Tess.

987
01:18:01,032 --> 01:18:02,233
Charlie?

988
01:18:08,366 --> 01:18:09,567
Charlie?

989
01:18:34,566 --> 01:18:36,167
Forgive me, Sam.

990
01:18:52,900 --> 01:18:54,701
l love you, Charlie.

991
01:19:45,533 --> 01:19:46,834
Sam?

992
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:54,035
Over there!
Outer rocks! That way!

993
01:20:01,733 --> 01:20:04,068
Just bear right,
all right? Slow down.

994
01:20:05,399 --> 01:20:07,534
We should be
coming up on it.

995
01:20:07,633 --> 01:20:09,067
We're clear on
the starboard side.

996
01:20:09,166 --> 01:20:10,734
AIl right, that first
one's going past us now.

997
01:20:16,733 --> 01:20:18,201
There it is!

998
01:20:18,566 --> 01:20:20,367
Goddamn it, Tess!

999
01:20:21,233 --> 01:20:22,867
It's at 10 o'clock,
about 10 meters off.

1000
01:20:22,967 --> 01:20:24,635
l can see it,
l can see the base!
l'm bringing her back.

1001
01:20:24,700 --> 01:20:25,834
Bear right, mate!
Bear right!

1002
01:20:25,900 --> 01:20:26,967
l got it,
l got it, l got it.

1003
01:20:27,032 --> 01:20:28,566
Get as close as you can!

1004
01:20:28,666 --> 01:20:29,733
Hey!

1005
01:20:29,833 --> 01:20:32,001
Hey!
Charlie, what are you doing?

1006
01:20:33,399 --> 01:20:36,668
Charlie! Charlie,
the water's like ice!
Don't be an idiot, mate!

1007
01:20:36,733 --> 01:20:38,134
Please wait for
the Coast Guard!

1008
01:20:38,199 --> 01:20:39,567
If we wait,
it'll be too late.

1009
01:20:39,733 --> 01:20:42,035
You won't last long enough
to save her, mate, Please!

1010
01:20:42,132 --> 01:20:44,133
This is why l was
given a second chance.

1011
01:20:44,366 --> 01:20:45,400
No! Wait! Charlie!

1012
01:20:51,633 --> 01:20:54,002
We need immediate
medical assistance
for one,..

1013
01:20:54,066 --> 01:20:55,500
Two!
He just dove in!

1014
01:20:55,566 --> 01:20:56,967
Make it two people!

1015
01:21:21,399 --> 01:21:22,500
Tess?

1016
01:21:24,666 --> 01:21:25,733
Tess?

1017
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:29,067
Tess?

1018
01:21:29,399 --> 01:21:30,500
Tess.

1019
01:21:33,032 --> 01:21:34,166
Tess.

1020
01:22:39,299 --> 01:22:40,566
Charlie!

1021
01:22:40,666 --> 01:22:42,134
I won't!

1022
01:22:50,333 --> 01:22:51,801
Come find me.

1023
01:24:35,199 --> 01:24:36,233
Sit tight.

1024
01:24:36,399 --> 01:24:37,500
Sit tight!

1025
01:25:27,399 --> 01:25:29,634
Never steal
another man's gin.

1026
01:25:30,566 --> 01:25:31,667
Water.

1027
01:25:32,466 --> 01:25:34,401
Water.
Yeah, all right.

1028
01:25:37,633 --> 01:25:39,735
Welcome back.
How you doing?

1029
01:25:41,166 --> 01:25:42,367
How is she?

1030
01:25:42,466 --> 01:25:45,168
Yeah, she's good, mate.
Yeah, she's good,
She's recovering.

1031
01:25:45,233 --> 01:25:47,335
Doctor said she
had hypothermia.

1032
01:25:47,399 --> 01:25:51,469
And when you hugged her,
your body warmth
kept her alive.

1033
01:25:53,132 --> 01:25:54,867
Look, well done, mate.
Proper hero.

1034
01:26:54,666 --> 01:26:56,467
l heard you were back home.

1035
01:27:04,666 --> 01:27:06,734
lsn't this
Bemelman's old boat?

1036
01:27:06,833 --> 01:27:08,334
lt's mine now.

1037
01:27:08,833 --> 01:27:11,001
They were gonna
strip it for scrap,
so l took it off their hands.

1038
01:27:11,066 --> 01:27:13,802
l always loved this boat.

1039
01:27:16,199 --> 01:27:18,301
Well, l'm gonna fix her up,

1040
01:27:18,533 --> 01:27:20,034
make some modifications.

1041
01:27:20,233 --> 01:27:21,634
Oh, yeah? Some flukes?

1042
01:27:21,700 --> 01:27:23,034
Yeah.

1043
01:27:23,399 --> 01:27:24,833
Some flukes.

1044
01:27:26,066 --> 01:27:27,667
You know,
that was the last
conversation l had

1045
01:27:27,733 --> 01:27:29,634
before l woke up
in the hospital bed.

1046
01:27:31,399 --> 01:27:32,533
Really?

1047
01:27:32,633 --> 01:27:36,903
Yep. Well, unless you include
Tink's radio chatter.
Which l don't.

1048
01:27:39,066 --> 01:27:40,734
You have a good memory.

1049
01:27:41,366 --> 01:27:44,135
Well, there's one thing
l'll never forget.

1050
01:27:44,199 --> 01:27:47,302
lt's that you saved my life,
Charlie St. Cloud.

1051
01:27:50,900 --> 01:27:54,036
She's a blue-water cruiser.
Where you headed?

1052
01:27:55,366 --> 01:27:56,734
Evermhere.

1053
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,235
As soon as she's sound,
l'm gonna sail
around the world,

1054
01:28:04,066 --> 01:28:05,167
Well, good luck.

1055
01:28:08,066 --> 01:28:10,234
Do you want to go
for a spin?

1056
01:28:16,166 --> 01:28:17,367
No, not today.

1057
01:28:17,466 --> 01:28:18,567
Come on, Tess.

1058
01:28:18,666 --> 01:28:21,468
You're gonna have to get back
on the water eventually,

1059
01:28:21,533 --> 01:28:23,067
l will. l will.

1060
01:28:25,900 --> 01:28:29,036
lt's not the water that
l'm afraid of, Charlie.

1061
01:28:30,466 --> 01:28:31,733
lt's you.

1062
01:28:35,233 --> 01:28:36,233
Me?

1063
01:28:37,032 --> 01:28:38,566
The way you
make me feel.,.

1064
01:28:40,399 --> 01:28:42,634
l don't know,
l've been having
these visions,

1065
01:28:42,700 --> 01:28:44,301
or maybe dreams,

1066
01:28:44,366 --> 01:28:48,069
but they're more
vivid than any dreams
that l've ever had, And.,.

1067
01:28:49,299 --> 01:28:50,800
And you're in them.

1068
01:28:51,633 --> 01:28:53,634
And we're in them, And.,.

1069
01:28:56,967 --> 01:28:58,335
Never mind.

1070
01:28:59,166 --> 01:29:01,167
They're not dreams, Tess.

1071
01:29:01,867 --> 01:29:03,501
They're memories.

1072
01:29:06,399 --> 01:29:08,667
''trust your heart
if the seas catch fire

1073
01:29:08,867 --> 01:29:11,035
"and live by love though
the stars walk backward"

1074
01:29:18,666 --> 01:29:20,534
How did you know that?

1075
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:27,069
lt's E.E. Cummings,
It was your dad's favorite.

1076
01:29:28,166 --> 01:29:30,201
lt's about taking chances.

1077
01:29:41,166 --> 01:29:43,167
Just take a chance, Tess.

1078
01:29:53,733 --> 01:29:55,367
My legs are still
a little wobbly.

1079
01:29:55,466 --> 01:29:56,967
No worries.

1080
01:30:39,233 --> 01:30:40,634
l miss you.

1081
01:30:43,399 --> 01:30:45,067
l'm okay, Charlie.

1082
01:30:46,533 --> 01:30:48,835
l'd give anything
for you to see me,

1083
01:30:48,900 --> 01:30:50,501
what l'd have become.

1084
01:30:52,666 --> 01:30:56,069
But no one ever gets to see
what could have been.

1085
01:30:59,566 --> 01:31:01,834
Sorry l had to
break our deal.

1086
01:31:03,733 --> 01:31:05,167
lt was time.

1087
01:31:06,900 --> 01:31:10,003
l mean, it's beyond anything
we ever imagined, Charlie.

1088
01:31:12,399 --> 01:31:14,868
l hurt as bad as
the day you died.

1089
01:31:15,833 --> 01:31:18,068
You hurt because
you're alive,

1090
01:31:35,066 --> 01:31:37,067
We'll always be brothers.

1091
01:31:38,733 --> 01:31:40,000
promise?

1092
01:31:41,366 --> 01:31:42,700
Every day?

1093
01:31:43,066 --> 01:31:46,002
Come rain or shine?
Come hell or high water?

1094
01:32:00,066 --> 01:32:01,400
l promise.

1095
01:33:13,733 --> 01:33:15,401
l'm gonna pretend
l like that,
