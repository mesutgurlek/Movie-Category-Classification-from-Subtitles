1
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:32,761
Oh, let's just get in there, baby.
Let's go. Hustle. Here we go.

2
00:00:34,135 --> 00:00:36,968
I love angry sex. This is the best.

3
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:38,831
Oh, you wanna do it right here, huh?

4
00:00:39,073 --> 00:00:43,066
Oh, yeah... Okay.

5
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:49,011
Give up, already.
Yeah, you know.

6
00:00:58,626 --> 00:01:02,153
I like this girl. Really do.

7
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:04,020
Sometimes you just know.

8
00:01:11,072 --> 00:01:13,870
I'm not finished.

9
00:01:21,115 --> 00:01:23,174
I tried like a motherfucker
to follow you up...

10
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:28,354
...but this door, it does a little thing
with the lock when you're inside.

11
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:32,582
Anyway, here's what I'm thinking.
We start with a blowjob.

12
00:01:32,827 --> 00:01:34,761
Yeah. I mean, obviously, you know?

13
00:01:34,995 --> 00:01:37,259
And most girls
find it rewarding the way I do it...

14
00:01:37,498 --> 00:01:42,094
...because I turn what is normally
a chore into, like, a training session.

15
00:01:42,336 --> 00:01:46,033
It's like my own special Head Start
program. Even got Chloraseptic spray.

16
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:48,639
Do that really well,
we move on to the nasty stuff.

17
00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:52,037
Bring my buddies over, maybe
take some "artsy" pictures, you know?

18
00:01:52,313 --> 00:01:55,214
Do some artsy live streaming video.
Totally tasteful.

19
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:57,110
Don't worry, I'll get you paid. Easy.

20
00:01:57,351 --> 00:01:59,376
That way you could
get that can opener fixed...

21
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:02,646
...lipo the back end,
maybe refurbish the balcony.

22
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:05,882
- Wait, I'm sorry. Is this a bad time?
- Yeah.

23
00:02:06,127 --> 00:02:08,493
Real quick, yes to bad timing
or yes, you wanna go...?

24
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:11,129
- Fuck you!
- Exactly.

25
00:02:20,174 --> 00:02:24,008
- Why won't you just die already?
- I accept your rebuke of my advances.

26
00:02:24,245 --> 00:02:27,214
But for future reference, could you
at least give me a reason why?

27
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:29,244
How about 10?

28
00:02:30,084 --> 00:02:31,642
I love angry sex. This is the best.

29
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,120
It's gonna be great. Just...

30
00:02:42,096 --> 00:02:44,291
Hey, we're going Dutch
on gas money, you know.

31
00:02:45,766 --> 00:02:46,733
Is that your phone?

32
00:02:48,169 --> 00:02:49,796
- Don't you answer?
- I don't know.

33
00:02:50,037 --> 00:02:51,698
Or are you more interested
in me right now?

34
00:02:51,939 --> 00:02:54,373
- I'm...
- Answer your phone. That's my phone.

35
00:02:54,642 --> 00:02:56,872
Shit. Hold on one second. I got it.

36
00:02:57,144 --> 00:02:58,338
Hello.

37
00:02:58,946 --> 00:03:00,675
Hey. Yeah, I got it. I'm a knee guy.

38
00:03:00,915 --> 00:03:02,746
- You need...
- Listen to me. Listen, Sarah...

39
00:03:02,983 --> 00:03:05,850
Shut the fuck up.
I'm not even listen...

40
00:03:06,086 --> 00:03:07,610
Oh, my God! Why aren't you...?

41
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:09,254
Dick!

42
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:12,516
- Listen. Sarah, are you pregnant?
- Oh, my God.

43
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,818
I'll just be a minute.

44
00:03:14,061 --> 00:03:16,655
You know what, you expect me
to swallow that horseshit?

45
00:03:16,897 --> 00:03:20,025
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm predictable.
Well, then fucking marry me!

46
00:03:20,568 --> 00:03:23,298
- Didn't see that one coming, did you?
- What are you doing?

47
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:26,097
How am I supposed to know
it was your sister? How was I?

48
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,468
Okay, it was dark, I was drunk
and I thought it was you.

49
00:03:30,477 --> 00:03:34,140
- Oh, she's pregnant too. Talk to her.
- What? No.

50
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:35,678
Okay, you tell your sister...

51
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:39,408
...that I'll make a donation
to Planned Parenthood in her honor.

52
00:03:40,921 --> 00:03:43,389
Sarah, my ex.

53
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:46,355
Big cunt.

54
00:03:56,337 --> 00:03:57,531
Rachel, I apologize.

55
00:03:57,771 --> 00:04:00,171
Sometimes when you try
a new restaurant, it's a gamble.

56
00:04:00,441 --> 00:04:02,534
And today we lost.

57
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,576
I'm thinking to avoid
any sexual obligation, that's you.

58
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:25,398
Oh, my God.

59
00:04:25,633 --> 00:04:28,500
- Everything okay?
- I can't eat this. I can't.

60
00:04:28,736 --> 00:04:32,467
Perhaps I can interest you in some of
our fabulous Famine Fiesta Fries?

61
00:04:32,706 --> 00:04:35,732
She could use a little more famine
and a little less fried.

62
00:04:42,683 --> 00:04:43,650
Tank.

63
00:04:44,151 --> 00:04:48,212
Okay. Since you have yet to
ask me anything at all...

64
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:51,549
...I just thought I should tell you
a little bit about myself.

65
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:52,816
I'm a social worker.

66
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,994
- Yeah, I know what you're thinking.
- Yeah?

67
00:04:55,229 --> 00:04:56,856
It's very... It's challenging work...

68
00:04:57,097 --> 00:05:01,397
...but it's so important.
- Whoa, whoa, there, big time.

69
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:04,900
I'm a customer satisfaction rep
at Airmeister Air Filtration Systems.

70
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,603
That is important work.
Because without air, we cannot live.

71
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:12,544
What can I get for you tonight?

72
00:05:13,714 --> 00:05:17,150
Is the corned beef quesadilla,
is that any good?

73
00:05:17,418 --> 00:05:19,113
Or what do you recommend?

74
00:05:19,353 --> 00:05:22,948
Do you mean unspoiled? For example,
if you said, "Is this milk any good?"...

75
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:26,648
...your concern would not be with taste
but rather your personal safety.

76
00:05:32,566 --> 00:05:35,763
Hi, my name is Pedro O'Malley.
I'll be your server for tonight.

77
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:37,334
Something to drink?

78
00:05:37,571 --> 00:05:40,369
Two Baja Car Bombs on the snap.

79
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:42,372
Okay, no, I don't drink...

80
00:05:42,643 --> 00:05:45,237
...but thank you.
- I wasn't ordering for you.

81
00:05:47,881 --> 00:05:50,281
- I gotta warn you, the stereo's busted.
- That's okay.

82
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:52,451
I've got a little bit
of a headache, so...

83
00:05:56,256 --> 00:05:57,883
See?!

84
00:05:58,659 --> 00:06:00,058
It's been like this for a month!

85
00:06:01,295 --> 00:06:03,058
I got it.

86
00:06:10,838 --> 00:06:13,568
These are for your ears!

87
00:06:14,641 --> 00:06:15,835
Thanks.

88
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:19,045
You look offended by the song!

89
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:22,407
But if you really listen,
it's not really vulgar.

90
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:27,552
It's about a guy, he's in love. And
I know he's saying, "Pop the pussy."

91
00:06:27,788 --> 00:06:29,813
But it's a metaphor for, like:

92
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:32,457
"I wanna hug you!"

93
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:36,423
<i>Pop that pussy
Hug me, hug me, hug me, hug me</i>

94
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:39,057
It's not about fucking.

95
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:41,426
It's about taking a relationship...

96
00:06:41,668 --> 00:06:43,693
...to another level!

97
00:06:44,304 --> 00:06:47,364
- What?
- Yeah. And now we see it.

98
00:06:47,641 --> 00:06:51,907
So we should listen to the whole thing
so you know the story.

99
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,512
Listen, listen.

100
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:59,043
No, it's easy, all right? She's not
even gonna make it past dinner.

101
00:06:59,286 --> 00:07:01,914
By the time I'm done, she'll know
the difference between...

102
00:07:02,156 --> 00:07:04,716
...what's in the hand
and what's in the bush.

103
00:07:06,994 --> 00:07:08,086
Hi.

104
00:07:08,328 --> 00:07:11,729
- Yeah, we said 7:00.
- I know.

105
00:07:11,965 --> 00:07:13,899
I tutor this high-school girl.

106
00:07:15,002 --> 00:07:16,993
She's part of my Head Start program.

107
00:07:17,237 --> 00:07:20,365
And she's slow, learning-disabled.

108
00:07:20,641 --> 00:07:23,269
It's sad.

109
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:28,608
Every time I come,
I feel like I'm wasting my time.

110
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:32,617
- You know, not in her eyes.
- Actually...

111
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,221
No one is doubting your memory,
which is both vivid and damning.

112
00:07:36,457 --> 00:07:39,620
But if I could, I'd like to briefly
challenge points four and seven.

113
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:43,352
Oh, really? Because, you know what?
I didn't even get to mention...

114
00:07:45,365 --> 00:07:46,389
Oh, my God.

115
00:07:47,234 --> 00:07:48,929
Please stop. Please stop.
Please stop.

116
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,913
So I'll call you later?

117
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,947
- And I'll call the cops, you asshole.
- I had a nice time tonight.

118
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:13,558
<i>- Hello.
- Josh, I just went on...</i>

119
00:08:13,794 --> 00:08:15,921
<i>- ... the worst date of my life.
- Rachel.</i>

120
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:20,224
<i>- Hey, look, I'm gl...
- I'm so, so sorry.</i>

121
00:08:20,467 --> 00:08:23,231
Why are you sorry?
Baby, I was the one who...

122
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:26,997
<i>- Can we maybe, you know, grab a...?
- Yeah. Yeah, no, that sounds great.</i>

123
00:08:27,241 --> 00:08:29,732
<i>- Yeah.
- I'd really like that.</i>

124
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:33,571
Listen, I'm out with a friend right now.
But can I call you?

125
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:36,042
<i>- What about dinner tomorrow night?
- I'd like that.</i>

126
00:08:36,283 --> 00:08:38,080
Yeah, I'd like that too. All right.

127
00:08:38,318 --> 00:08:42,186
I'm so glad you called. All right, bye.

128
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:45,183
Told you.
I just show them the difference...

129
00:08:45,425 --> 00:08:47,791
...between what's in the hand
and what's in the bush.

130
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:50,462
You have mastered
the female psyche.

131
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:53,029
To get them to run,
I make them think that I'm shit.

132
00:08:53,267 --> 00:08:55,599
To get them to come,
I make them think they're shit.

133
00:08:55,836 --> 00:08:57,827
Either way, you're the asshole.

134
00:08:58,572 --> 00:09:00,369
It's what I do.

135
00:09:35,876 --> 00:09:37,639
<i>Sorry.</i>

136
00:09:52,192 --> 00:09:53,489
All right.

137
00:09:54,061 --> 00:09:55,585
Look at you, all white and thin.

138
00:09:55,829 --> 00:09:58,992
I bet if I laid you on this bar,
she could snort you.

139
00:09:59,566 --> 00:10:00,533
Listen, beauty queen.

140
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:04,066
I know people are concerned about
you because you're dangerously thin.

141
00:10:04,304 --> 00:10:07,068
But I'm not one of those people.
Yet I am concerned.

142
00:10:07,307 --> 00:10:08,831
That you've had too many drinks...

143
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:12,510
...and your fingers are in this bowl
like it's one of your sorority sisters.

144
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:14,872
These pretzeled devils,
far from complimentary.

145
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:16,911
I mean, baby,
get your head in the game.

146
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:19,880
Nothing tastes as good
as looking good.

147
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,985
- That is just...
- Excuse me.

148
00:10:22,756 --> 00:10:25,657
Are you psycho? I mean,
how can you even begin to talk to...?

149
00:10:25,892 --> 00:10:26,881
Easy, Urlacher.

150
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:30,119
Ever notice it's the linebackers
concerned with people not eating?

151
00:10:30,364 --> 00:10:33,333
If the pussy police here would
stop ordering her fries tempura...

152
00:10:33,567 --> 00:10:34,499
I just had a child.

153
00:10:34,735 --> 00:10:37,067
Congratulations.
I'm sure he was probably delicious.

154
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:38,896
Looks like you
downed the whole thing.

155
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:41,699
You're an asshole.

156
00:10:44,277 --> 00:10:47,735
- You really are an asshole.
- Then walk away.

157
00:10:59,926 --> 00:11:03,123
- Let me just go get my purse, okay?
- Get cigarettes.

158
00:11:05,198 --> 00:11:06,165
- Let's go.
- Okay.

159
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:10,200
Take me. Take me to your house.
Take me right now to your house.

160
00:11:10,437 --> 00:11:13,406
- Hey, guy.
- Tank, hey. Tank, this is Renee.

161
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,437
- Yeah. Come here.
- Renee, Tank.

162
00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:18,177
- Hey, okay. Two seconds.
- Talk to me for a second.

163
00:11:18,445 --> 00:11:20,743
- Yeah, I'll talk to you all night.
- All right.

164
00:11:20,981 --> 00:11:23,609
Didn't I just save your ass?
I just cleaned up your bed...

165
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:27,718
...and you're shitting in it again, okay?
Aren't you getting fucking married?

166
00:11:28,121 --> 00:11:30,248
I am getting married...

167
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:32,825
...but not tonight.

168
00:11:33,427 --> 00:11:36,191
- Renee. Renee, there she is.
- Josh.

169
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:39,661
There she is. She's all mine.

170
00:11:43,737 --> 00:11:46,001
I have to work tomorrow.

171
00:11:47,507 --> 00:11:50,874
Everybody's gotta work tomorrow.
It's Tuesday.

172
00:11:51,111 --> 00:11:55,810
Good one.
I have a strict no-sleepover policy.

173
00:11:57,484 --> 00:11:58,917
Yeah.

174
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:09,157
Come on, Tank, it's almost 5.

175
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:14,094
For some people that's not tonight,
it's tomorrow.

176
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:24,074
I hate those people.

177
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,657
Shit.

178
00:12:41,895 --> 00:12:46,195
Dustin? Yeah, five minutes is fine.
Okay, bye.

179
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:48,833
- Dude. What the shit?
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

180
00:12:49,069 --> 00:12:52,732
I told you this was happening. As
of now, I'm training for the marathon.

181
00:12:52,973 --> 00:12:56,966
Goal: Run, don't walk. Nothing wrong
with a little bit of discipline.

182
00:12:57,244 --> 00:12:58,609
By the way, you should try it.

183
00:12:58,845 --> 00:13:01,313
You need discipline
like I need to miss my period.

184
00:13:01,581 --> 00:13:03,173
Seriously, you're already, like...

185
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:06,681
...a crazy, insane, OCD alpha-dog...

186
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,615
...cyborg crazy creature.

187
00:13:08,855 --> 00:13:10,254
You mean, I have a job?

188
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:14,085
And now you're gonna wake me up
at 5:15 every single morning...

189
00:13:14,327 --> 00:13:17,262
...so that eventually
you can run 26 miles in a circle.

190
00:13:17,497 --> 00:13:21,263
Here's the great part. You get to
go back to sleep indefinitely. Yea!

191
00:13:22,536 --> 00:13:28,736
For the record, I am involved in
a very taboo interoffice relationship.

192
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:33,108
- Morning.
- Good morning.

193
00:13:33,413 --> 00:13:37,179
Dustin, the bad boy
from the wrong side of the tracks.

194
00:13:37,417 --> 00:13:38,748
I'm from Lexington.

195
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:40,782
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

196
00:13:41,021 --> 00:13:42,921
- See you.
- Yeah.

197
00:13:48,862 --> 00:13:51,387
That's not the secret knock.

198
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,759
That's the one. What's going on, man?

199
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:58,630
I need to move this into your room.
Tonight is the night.

200
00:13:58,872 --> 00:14:02,308
And if all goes according to plan,
consider this move permanent.

201
00:14:02,576 --> 00:14:06,012
<i>- "Lawrence of a Labia"?
- Yeah, in a moment of weakness...</i>

202
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:10,613
...I bought the entire EFI. The
Erotic Film Institute's top 100. Enjoy.

203
00:14:10,851 --> 00:14:13,183
Where did it go wrong?
You have a serious problem.

204
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,411
Better than taking
sexual frustrations out...

205
00:14:15,655 --> 00:14:18,249
...on a parade of one-night skanks
I'll never see again.

206
00:14:18,491 --> 00:14:19,458
- True.
- Good morning.

207
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:22,856
Hey, no, no, come here. This
is Dusty, my roommate-slash-cousin.

208
00:14:23,096 --> 00:14:26,896
Not technically related. Our parents
were friends until his mom walked out.

209
00:14:27,133 --> 00:14:30,432
Slash-fuckhead for bringing up
bad family shit at inappropriate times.

210
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:31,637
It's nice to meet you.

211
00:14:31,872 --> 00:14:33,840
- Nice to meet you.
- Fucking family.

212
00:14:34,074 --> 00:14:37,134
What's the plan? Bring this girl
back here, pop open chloroform...

213
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:39,207
...insert Tab A into Slot B, repeat?

214
00:14:39,446 --> 00:14:42,040
No. Tonight is the night
I tell her how I feel.

215
00:14:42,282 --> 00:14:45,740
Tank, this girl... This girl is my
soul mate and it's time she knew that.

216
00:14:45,986 --> 00:14:48,250
Not if you want to fuck her.

217
00:14:48,488 --> 00:14:51,423
You, what is the nicest thing
I've said to you since I met you?

218
00:14:51,658 --> 00:14:54,024
You complimented me
on my technique.

219
00:14:54,261 --> 00:14:55,626
Okay, look, I'm not you, okay?

220
00:14:55,862 --> 00:14:58,956
I'm not gonna manipulate her,
I'm not gonna con her.

221
00:14:59,132 --> 00:15:00,759
- I'm just gonna be myself.
- No.

222
00:15:01,001 --> 00:15:04,300
Yourself is a repressed headcase that
beats more meat than Rocky Balboa.

223
00:15:04,537 --> 00:15:08,064
By hiding porn, taking her to joints
you hate, training for a marathon...

224
00:15:08,341 --> 00:15:11,606
...you're not showing the real you.
You're showing a highlight-reel you.

225
00:15:11,845 --> 00:15:16,111
- Thus, in fact, you're conning her.
- You don't get it. You don't get it.

226
00:15:16,349 --> 00:15:19,079
I love her. Alexis...

227
00:15:19,319 --> 00:15:21,617
Alexis is my angel.

228
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:25,755
You get it, right?

229
00:15:26,993 --> 00:15:29,291
We don't get it. We don't.

230
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:31,587
Anyway, we can skip this
"call me" scenario.

231
00:15:31,831 --> 00:15:32,923
- I'm already late.
- Great.

232
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:34,758
I wanna know something.
This chick...

233
00:15:35,001 --> 00:15:36,093
- What's her name?
- Alexis.

234
00:15:36,336 --> 00:15:39,703
If this chick Alexis means so much to
you, how come I haven't met her yet?

235
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,805
Because she means
that much to me.

236
00:15:42,075 --> 00:15:46,136
Mazel tov, man.
Love. Angels. Awesome.

237
00:15:46,413 --> 00:15:50,110
What about that girl at camp who
used to let you play with her boobies?

238
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:53,877
- Jackie? We were 15.
- She looked like a baton with titties.

239
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,213
What about Gracie, love of your life...

240
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:58,947
...till you caught her blowing Holstein
freshman year?

241
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:01,787
- What's your point?
- My point is this: Lindsay, gym crush.

242
00:16:02,028 --> 00:16:04,895
Melissa, your barista.
A lot of angels, Dust.

243
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:07,622
- Why you gotta be such an asshole?
- It's what I do, man.

244
00:16:07,867 --> 00:16:10,836
Good luck. If you need them,
condoms are in the medicine cabinet.

245
00:16:11,071 --> 00:16:15,030
If not, Jergens lotion,
underneath my bed.

246
00:16:25,885 --> 00:16:28,945
Dusty, this is absurd.

247
00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:31,214
What? You love steak,
we're eating steak.

248
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:35,087
- You're a vegan.
- Not tonight. Eat, eat, eat. Enjoy.

249
00:16:36,129 --> 00:16:41,192
I feel a little guilty loving steak
so much and you're a vegan.

250
00:16:41,634 --> 00:16:43,397
But whatever.

251
00:16:44,037 --> 00:16:46,369
I love the way you eat.

252
00:16:46,973 --> 00:16:48,634
I love that you eat.

253
00:16:48,908 --> 00:16:50,933
I love that you pay.

254
00:16:54,314 --> 00:16:59,843
Seriously, though, I just love
watching you do anything.

255
00:17:00,086 --> 00:17:02,884
I love it... I love you, Alexis.
I love you.

256
00:17:07,627 --> 00:17:09,094
Oh, shit.

257
00:17:10,597 --> 00:17:16,092
We just said more than once
we're gonna keep it light.

258
00:17:16,669 --> 00:17:20,264
- We work together, we're friends.
- That's what I'm supposed to say.

259
00:17:20,507 --> 00:17:23,738
Right? I mean, I'm supposed to be
the relationship tough guy, you know?

260
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:25,068
I'm the dude.

261
00:17:25,345 --> 00:17:26,869
The dude can't just come out with:

262
00:17:27,147 --> 00:17:30,082
"I've loved you since the moment
I first saw you, pounding out...

263
00:17:30,316 --> 00:17:32,341
...a lender's agreement,
eating Cocoa Puffs...

264
00:17:32,585 --> 00:17:34,519
...while some pretty boy
drooled over you."

265
00:17:34,754 --> 00:17:38,155
- Michi Yamana.
- Yeah, Michi Yamana. Dick.

266
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:41,619
So I love you, madly.

267
00:17:41,861 --> 00:17:43,590
Sorry. l... l... I know I need to stop.

268
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:46,560
Now, stop. Just stop speaking,
Dustin. Just shut your mouth.

269
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:50,702
I'm sorry. Wow, kamikaze, huh?
See, this is what you do to me.

270
00:17:50,937 --> 00:17:52,837
- What do I say here, but...?
- I'm sorry.

271
00:17:53,073 --> 00:17:55,701
But do you know how hard it's been
trying to play it cool?

272
00:17:55,975 --> 00:17:57,533
- It's been five weeks.
- I know.

273
00:17:57,811 --> 00:17:59,244
We haven't even had sex.

274
00:18:02,715 --> 00:18:06,378
Well, that's why we're here, Alexis.
I wanted to talk to you about...

275
00:18:08,054 --> 00:18:09,851
I think I'm ready
to take the next step.

276
00:18:11,391 --> 00:18:13,882
Sex isn't a step, Dustin.

277
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:17,825
Being exclusive would be a step
or moving in together is a step.

278
00:18:18,064 --> 00:18:19,463
Then let's move in together.

279
00:18:24,871 --> 00:18:26,361
I need you to take me home.

280
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:29,871
But it just felt so right.
It just felt so right.

281
00:18:30,143 --> 00:18:31,405
No, it does, it feels right.

282
00:18:31,678 --> 00:18:36,377
Just not right now.

283
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:38,709
"Just not right now."

284
00:18:44,858 --> 00:18:46,223
<i>Oh, God.</i>

285
00:18:54,701 --> 00:18:56,566
God, I'm a fag.

286
00:19:01,007 --> 00:19:04,170
- Dude, you canceled Spice.
- It was like 21 bucks a month, dude.

287
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,777
Someone had a rough night.

288
00:19:10,617 --> 00:19:12,278
I'm Mr. Right...

289
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:15,283
...just not Mr. Right Now.

290
00:19:17,157 --> 00:19:20,422
What...? What does that even mean?
What does that even mean?

291
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:23,094
- I told her I loved her...
- Oh, no.

292
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:24,887
What?

293
00:19:25,465 --> 00:19:29,401
I went in early. No, no, I know.
I went in a little early, but she...

294
00:19:31,304 --> 00:19:35,172
- Thanks for your support. Sweet.
- Dustin.

295
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:39,205
Dusty, look.

296
00:19:39,479 --> 00:19:41,947
This too shall pass, all right?

297
00:19:42,215 --> 00:19:45,082
But that journey begins...

298
00:19:45,318 --> 00:19:47,286
...with self-exploration.

299
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,715
And I'm holding the map, Dusty.

300
00:19:49,956 --> 00:19:51,355
Hey.

301
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:54,753
Kid, I got your 'bate crate.

302
00:19:54,994 --> 00:19:56,928
You know how much
you love your 'bate crate.

303
00:19:57,163 --> 00:19:59,358
"I'm like comfort food for your penis."

304
00:20:02,435 --> 00:20:04,460
- What do I do?
- Okay.

305
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:07,104
What do you do?
Okay, let's look at the options.

306
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:10,969
Stalk her. But you're never gonna
be with her. Love her from a distance.

307
00:20:11,244 --> 00:20:14,236
Never have a family but you could
love her kids from a distance.

308
00:20:14,514 --> 00:20:16,744
Murder-suicide,
but that's trending upward.

309
00:20:16,983 --> 00:20:20,146
- Or I could just hire you.
- No.

310
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:22,251
- Why not?
- I don't fuck with family.

311
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:25,850
Well, technically
we're not blood-related. Right?

312
00:20:26,092 --> 00:20:27,821
Go to bed, Dust.

313
00:20:28,494 --> 00:20:30,985
You're serious. Okay.

314
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:33,028
I'll get serious.

315
00:20:33,433 --> 00:20:35,424
If I do this...

316
00:20:38,004 --> 00:20:41,838
If I do this, I'm gonna make it
the finest Tank-ing of my career.

317
00:20:42,108 --> 00:20:43,166
My fucking masterpiece.

318
00:20:43,443 --> 00:20:45,934
She'll lose her shit
like a shit collector with amnesia.

319
00:20:46,212 --> 00:20:50,410
I'm talking about a Turkish twist,
epic mindfuck of a Tank-ing, okay?

320
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:55,246
Her brain'll be rocking back and forth
in the shower for like three weeks.

321
00:20:55,488 --> 00:20:58,457
Okay? I'm talking about
demonic fucking Tank.

322
00:20:58,691 --> 00:21:00,056
I'll be flying up into the sky.

323
00:21:00,293 --> 00:21:04,696
She's gonna cry tears that form
"Call Dusty" on the ground.

324
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:07,559
Yes? Am I doing it?
Tell me I'm doing it.

325
00:21:09,836 --> 00:21:12,236
Okay, that was weird.
And I'm not sure that...

326
00:21:12,472 --> 00:21:14,906
Listen, rain check, maybe though.

327
00:21:15,174 --> 00:21:18,871
Wow, can't believe I almost resorted
to emotional terrorism. I'm sorry.

328
00:21:19,145 --> 00:21:21,545
You're sweet.
Next time with the next one, maybe.

329
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:23,544
- Thank you.
- I'm here.

330
00:21:25,285 --> 00:21:27,219
A little crazy. Sweet, crazy mostly.

331
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:33,121
Don't say a word.

332
00:21:57,483 --> 00:21:59,747
God! Son of...

333
00:21:59,986 --> 00:22:03,820
Why? That stupid...

334
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,560
Hi. Tank Turner,
Customer Satisfaction.

335
00:22:09,796 --> 00:22:11,093
How may I help you today?

336
00:22:11,331 --> 00:22:14,391
<i>Excuse me, do you have any idea
how long I was just on hold?</i>

337
00:22:14,634 --> 00:22:16,465
<i>It's been like an hour and a half.</i>

338
00:22:16,703 --> 00:22:18,102
<i>Hello. In your manual...</i>

339
00:22:18,338 --> 00:22:20,898
<i>... you've expressed a possibility
of some odor issues.</i>

340
00:22:21,174 --> 00:22:25,804
<i>"Faint aroma," it says here on page 7.
Come on. "Faint aroma"? Bullshit.</i>

341
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:28,639
<i>It smells like burnt fucking hair, dude.</i>

342
00:22:28,915 --> 00:22:33,249
<i>Because apparently
I paid 49.90-motherfucking-5...</i>

343
00:22:33,486 --> 00:22:37,855
<i>... so that my sweet-ass condo smells
like some Korean cat barbecue.</i>

344
00:22:38,091 --> 00:22:39,922
<i>- Touchdown.
- You lose. You lose.</i>

345
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:41,683
You suck.

346
00:22:42,628 --> 00:22:46,530
Sir, I will gladly give you a refund, but
that's not gonna solve your problem.

347
00:22:47,834 --> 00:22:49,495
New girl.

348
00:22:52,038 --> 00:22:53,699
<i>New girl</i>

349
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,198
<i>Ooh, new girl</i>

350
00:22:58,745 --> 00:23:00,474
Did the emotional terrorist win?

351
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:03,648
I just... You know, it's funny.
I never noticed your highlights...

352
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:05,817
...until somebody actually
said something.

353
00:23:06,085 --> 00:23:07,518
They're actually really good.

354
00:23:07,987 --> 00:23:10,478
- Just tell me how it works.
- Let me make this clear.

355
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:13,624
Before she can love you,
she has to hate me.

356
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:16,590
But before she can hate me,
she has to like me.

357
00:23:16,829 --> 00:23:18,820
That may be
the hardest part of the equation.

358
00:23:19,065 --> 00:23:20,293
So I set up the meet-cute.

359
00:23:20,533 --> 00:23:22,728
In every movie,
the stars meet in some cutesy way.

360
00:23:22,969 --> 00:23:25,904
Since every woman is looking
for that dreamy, witty, goofy guy...

361
00:23:26,139 --> 00:23:29,575
...of their sitcom, rom-com fantasies,
I've gotta be that thing.

362
00:23:29,842 --> 00:23:30,968
Here.

363
00:23:31,244 --> 00:23:33,508
Lucky slap on the ass. Hit it.

364
00:24:09,348 --> 00:24:10,542
Are you okay?

365
00:24:14,587 --> 00:24:17,454
That was rough. I'm Alexis.

366
00:24:27,066 --> 00:24:28,465
Wow, that looked really real.

367
00:24:29,702 --> 00:24:32,034
- Is that real?
- It's real and it hurts.

368
00:24:32,271 --> 00:24:35,001
Okay. So, like, what happens now?
You come back every day...

369
00:24:35,274 --> 00:24:38,038
...for a couple weeks. Slowly,
eventually you build her trust.

370
00:24:38,511 --> 00:24:40,945
- Daddy bee's got the honey.
- That's her number.

371
00:24:41,214 --> 00:24:43,910
- Let's go eat.
- How...? How did...?

372
00:24:44,717 --> 00:24:47,550
Now, remember, she's classy.
So maybe a fast-food joint.

373
00:24:47,787 --> 00:24:49,550
Or wait, wait, drive-through.

374
00:24:49,789 --> 00:24:52,656
Do I tell you what flavor of jam
to eat out of your boss's ass?

375
00:24:52,892 --> 00:24:56,225
No. Dusty, it's what I do, okay?
You want offensive locales?

376
00:24:56,462 --> 00:24:59,192
There's a place in Revere,
they let you boil your own dolphin.

377
00:24:59,432 --> 00:25:01,593
Arlington, you can have
a dominatrix waitress...

378
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:04,564
...take a dump on your lap
while she peppers your Cobb salad.

379
00:25:04,804 --> 00:25:08,035
I know a spot in P-town, you can get
a meat loaf shaped like a cock.

380
00:25:08,574 --> 00:25:11,702
You gotta trust me.
She's not gonna know what hit her.

381
00:25:13,713 --> 00:25:13,974
All right. Good luck.

382
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:22,754
- Do not wear that, please.
- What am I doing?

383
00:25:22,989 --> 00:25:24,820
Just take this.
This is what you're doing.

384
00:25:25,057 --> 00:25:28,652
Clean the pipes. It's mandatory to
flush them out after a relationship.

385
00:25:28,895 --> 00:25:31,363
That's disgusting.
But seriously, what's wrong with me?

386
00:25:31,597 --> 00:25:33,087
Dustin's a good guy.

387
00:25:33,332 --> 00:25:35,823
- You're such a fucking girl sometimes.
- Pretty good guy.

388
00:25:36,068 --> 00:25:37,467
A good guy? Who cares?

389
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:41,298
A good guy is, like,
somebody that your parents dig or...

390
00:25:41,574 --> 00:25:45,032
- Listen to me. In the real world... Ami.
- I'm listening.

391
00:25:45,311 --> 00:25:47,802
- In the real world...
- Yes.

392
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,538
What if he's a good man
with a good heart...

393
00:25:51,817 --> 00:25:54,809
...and he's smart? And if
he's not too rough on the eyes?

394
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:59,286
If "ifs" and "buts" were cocks and nuts,
I'd be getting gangbanged right now.

395
00:25:59,525 --> 00:26:02,961
Seriously. But it's that I wanna teach
you something that took me, like...

396
00:26:03,195 --> 00:26:05,561
...years and years of promiscuity
to learn, okay?

397
00:26:05,798 --> 00:26:07,561
- What is this outfit?
- It's aweso...

398
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,563
Hey, how many guys
have you slept with?

399
00:26:09,802 --> 00:26:12,532
- Like, total? Three, right?
- Two.

400
00:26:14,407 --> 00:26:16,671
- Two?
- I'm a serial monogamist.

401
00:26:16,943 --> 00:26:20,902
Well, okay. That's, like, the first
big, huge problem right there.

402
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:24,115
Didn't anybody ever tell you
that you have to suck a few frogs...

403
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:27,080
...before you get to suck a prince?

404
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,220
I believe it's "kiss."

405
00:26:29,455 --> 00:26:31,184
Pretend it's a year abroad, you know?

406
00:26:31,424 --> 00:26:36,020
But instead of going to Europe, you're
gonna bang a whole shitload of dudes.

407
00:26:36,262 --> 00:26:38,822
- It's awesome.
- I haven't been drunk in a long time.

408
00:26:39,065 --> 00:26:41,226
Good. You need it. You need it.

409
00:26:41,467 --> 00:26:44,698
Now tell me something.
What do you see in this box?

410
00:26:46,272 --> 00:26:49,969
- I see into the...
- No, in the box.

411
00:26:50,576 --> 00:26:53,010
An inordinate amount
of masturbatory aides...

412
00:26:53,245 --> 00:26:57,181
...which some,
I pray, are novelty-sized.

413
00:26:58,818 --> 00:27:01,309
Oh, my God.

414
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:04,616
Okay, that will do nicely.

415
00:27:04,857 --> 00:27:07,223
- You, show her a good time tonight.
- I love you.

416
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:08,984
- Show her a good time.
- I love you.

417
00:27:09,228 --> 00:27:11,423
- Such a good time. Love you.
- Have a great night.

418
00:27:11,664 --> 00:27:12,858
Don't be scared without me.

419
00:27:13,099 --> 00:27:15,863
- I'll be back. I'll be back.
- Yeah. I'll be waiting...

420
00:27:16,102 --> 00:27:19,128
- She's my roommate.
- I bet she gives great head.

421
00:27:19,372 --> 00:27:21,772
Actually, I'm sure she does.

422
00:27:22,041 --> 00:27:23,508
You're pretty drunk.

423
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:26,370
I'm pretty ready to rock.

424
00:27:28,948 --> 00:27:30,745
Oh, boy.

425
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:33,577
Tank, is this a Mustang?

426
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:35,116
It's a GTO.

427
00:27:35,921 --> 00:27:40,255
- A... Whatever that means.
- Yeah.

428
00:27:41,227 --> 00:27:44,663
Well, listen, I just wanna warn you,
my stereo's busted.

429
00:27:44,897 --> 00:27:47,297
Oh, that's cool. That's cool.

430
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:56,337
Hey, this is my...
I almost lost my virginity to this song.

431
00:28:08,454 --> 00:28:09,079
- Let's go.
- Yeah, let's go.

432
00:28:13,492 --> 00:28:16,723
- This is a first, Tank.
- Yeah, me too.

433
00:28:16,962 --> 00:28:19,658
Should we sit front row and center?

434
00:28:21,934 --> 00:28:23,697
Oh, wild.

435
00:28:25,171 --> 00:28:27,071
Yeah, can we get
two Long Island Iced Teas?

436
00:28:27,306 --> 00:28:29,433
And put the chop-chop on that, lady.

437
00:28:29,709 --> 00:28:33,110
Could you make mine a double?
And two shots of tequila, please.

438
00:28:39,218 --> 00:28:40,617
Okay, let's slow down, princess.

439
00:28:40,853 --> 00:28:43,720
You're getting sloshed
like it's your prom night here.

440
00:28:44,724 --> 00:28:48,091
- I never went to prom. I never went.
- No shock there. I believe that.

441
00:28:48,327 --> 00:28:50,090
I had the date, I had the dress.

442
00:28:50,329 --> 00:28:52,923
But prom was the night my dog
bit my sister in the neck...

443
00:28:53,165 --> 00:28:54,826
...and we had to put him down.
- Shit.

444
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:57,695
And I will never... Oh, my goodness.

445
00:28:57,937 --> 00:29:00,428
- ever forget the horror
in little Fraggle's eyes...

446
00:29:00,673 --> 00:29:03,642
...as his paw went limp in my hand.

447
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:06,605
It was horrible. Blood.
It was just, like:

448
00:29:06,879 --> 00:29:09,814
I'm sure that's not the only thing
that's gone limp in your hand.

449
00:29:10,049 --> 00:29:12,882
I will say it. In all sincerity,
that sucks hard.

450
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:14,950
It's sad to lose a pet.

451
00:29:15,187 --> 00:29:16,916
Where do they learn how to do this?

452
00:29:17,156 --> 00:29:20,216
- Well, I taught them a few things.
- I wanna know.

453
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:26,155
That's incredible.

454
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:30,291
What is that?

455
00:29:30,536 --> 00:29:33,733
- What is that?
- I think we should just fuck tonight.

456
00:29:48,888 --> 00:29:51,379
That looks pretty.

457
00:29:51,624 --> 00:29:53,854
- I'm gonna go pee.
- Got it.

458
00:29:56,729 --> 00:29:57,696
Hey, I can't talk.

459
00:29:57,930 --> 00:30:00,455
- Where are you?
- I'm out, I'm seeing a band.

460
00:30:00,699 --> 00:30:03,224
They suck, but I'm seeing them
so I really can't talk.

461
00:30:03,469 --> 00:30:06,563
- Put your "Guitar Hero" down.
- What the fuck are you talking about?

462
00:30:06,806 --> 00:30:09,934
I'm not playing "Guitar Hero."
It's Saturday night. I'm out.

463
00:30:10,209 --> 00:30:12,575
Just put it down.
We have problems.

464
00:30:12,812 --> 00:30:14,006
All right. What's the story?

465
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:18,683
I am drunk and he's either
the biggest asshole in America...

466
00:30:18,951 --> 00:30:21,818
...or trying to convince me
he's the biggest asshole in America.

467
00:30:22,054 --> 00:30:26,013
Either way, even a broken clock is
right twice a day, but this guy...

468
00:30:26,258 --> 00:30:28,818
Come on. How better to
appreciate Dustin than to do this?

469
00:30:29,061 --> 00:30:31,529
Than to bang this guy,
who's obviously far inferior...

470
00:30:31,764 --> 00:30:34,733
...but probably hung like Seabiscuit.
Right?

471
00:30:34,967 --> 00:30:38,733
Now go. Go and bang. Bang
like you have never "bung" before.

472
00:30:38,971 --> 00:30:41,462
And do it for Dustin.

473
00:30:43,475 --> 00:30:44,772
Jesus.

474
00:30:45,044 --> 00:30:47,410
- Baby doll...
- Hi.

475
00:30:47,646 --> 00:30:48,874
- Hi.
- I'm Alexis.

476
00:30:49,114 --> 00:30:50,945
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

477
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:54,744
And when it comes to love,
there's only one thing you can trust.

478
00:30:54,987 --> 00:30:57,922
It's not your friends,
it's not your head.

479
00:30:58,157 --> 00:31:01,422
It's that little voice
inside your clamburger.

480
00:31:05,331 --> 00:31:07,561
"Listen to me."

481
00:31:16,342 --> 00:31:18,867
Watch this. It's a game.
It's called "Who's at the Door?"

482
00:31:19,144 --> 00:31:20,941
And I look out the peephole.

483
00:31:21,413 --> 00:31:23,074
It's the mailman.

484
00:31:27,753 --> 00:31:30,745
Would it hurt you to play with her tits?
Help me out.

485
00:31:33,092 --> 00:31:34,684
You can stay there. That's good.

486
00:31:34,927 --> 00:31:37,293
Oh, you grab that.
I'll get the next one.

487
00:31:37,529 --> 00:31:39,827
- There won't be a next time.
- Lucky me.

488
00:31:46,138 --> 00:31:50,097
And our motto, basically,
is, "Without air, we..."

489
00:31:50,376 --> 00:31:52,776
"Without air, we cannot live."

490
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:54,344
- Stop.
- Right.

491
00:31:54,613 --> 00:31:57,047
I get it. You're a dick.

492
00:31:57,283 --> 00:31:59,581
I'm sufficiently offended.

493
00:31:59,985 --> 00:32:01,509
Done.

494
00:32:24,243 --> 00:32:27,041
Coming up?

495
00:32:39,658 --> 00:32:41,558
Suit yourself.

496
00:32:43,729 --> 00:32:46,596
Enjoy the long ride home.

497
00:32:54,073 --> 00:32:55,267
I'm going home, okay?

498
00:32:55,507 --> 00:32:57,475
Why am I going home?
Because I'm going home.

499
00:32:57,710 --> 00:33:01,806
I'm getting in the car. Eyes
in the game and the head in the ball.

500
00:33:02,047 --> 00:33:03,742
Can't do it.

501
00:33:04,883 --> 00:33:07,078
Just start the car.
Just start the car, baby.

502
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:09,685
Just gotta start the car,
get the fuck out of here.

503
00:33:09,922 --> 00:33:13,323
Why? Because, look. Your head's
in the game, your balls are attached...

504
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:17,495
<i>...and you're gonna go home
and maybe she'll call you mañana.</i>

505
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:19,527
Why would she call me?
She'll call Dusty.

506
00:33:19,765 --> 00:33:22,700
Because she's what? Dusty's
girlfriend. Follow the bouncing ball.

507
00:33:22,935 --> 00:33:25,563
She is Dusty's girlfriend.

508
00:33:26,338 --> 00:33:28,203
Listen to me.

509
00:33:31,677 --> 00:33:35,545
What is wrong with you, asshole?

510
00:33:48,494 --> 00:33:54,091
You asked me to trust you.

511
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,833
- And I trusted you.
- Done.

512
00:33:58,470 --> 00:33:59,459
Somehow.

513
00:33:59,705 --> 00:34:01,366
Some way.

514
00:34:03,876 --> 00:34:05,343
Thank you.

515
00:34:10,249 --> 00:34:11,910
Dude, you did it. She just called.

516
00:34:12,151 --> 00:34:14,779
Okay, quote,
"I just had the worst night of my life."

517
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:17,580
"I just had the worst night of my life."
You did it, man.

518
00:34:17,823 --> 00:34:19,051
We're having lunch tomorrow.

519
00:34:19,291 --> 00:34:21,282
Tank, we're having lunch.
Can you believe it?

520
00:34:21,527 --> 00:34:24,621
Dude, when it comes to being
an asshole, you are a genius.

521
00:34:24,863 --> 00:34:26,763
Genius.

522
00:34:29,935 --> 00:34:31,459
Anything for a friend.

523
00:34:33,038 --> 00:34:36,337
So about the other night.

524
00:34:36,608 --> 00:34:38,576
Okay, I was stupid. I was stupid.

525
00:34:38,844 --> 00:34:42,507
It's just... I've never gone this far
with a girl, emotionally.

526
00:34:42,748 --> 00:34:44,648
- And I just lost it.
- Slow down. Slow down.

527
00:34:44,883 --> 00:34:46,874
I was stupid and harsh...

528
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:48,518
...and I'm sorry.

529
00:34:48,754 --> 00:34:52,019
Last night I went out
with a real asshole. Horrible.

530
00:34:52,257 --> 00:34:54,782
It just made me realize
that guys like you are so rare.

531
00:34:57,196 --> 00:34:59,494
But it also made me realize
how few guys I've dated.

532
00:34:59,731 --> 00:35:01,722
How few guys
I've actually gone out with.

533
00:35:01,967 --> 00:35:04,435
Like, none. I need to date
and you need to date...

534
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:07,503
...other people. I'm just saying that...

535
00:35:07,739 --> 00:35:11,971
What I'm trying to say is that
I wanna start over as friends first.

536
00:35:12,244 --> 00:35:14,644
Like, be friends.

537
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,178
I like you as my friend.

538
00:35:24,089 --> 00:35:25,818
Start over...

539
00:35:26,058 --> 00:35:28,185
...as friends first.
- Friends.

540
00:35:28,427 --> 00:35:30,361
Like Harry and Sally.

541
00:35:33,799 --> 00:35:37,326
I think the point of that movie was that
men and women can't just be friends.

542
00:35:37,569 --> 00:35:40,470
No, no, no,
they can be just friends...

543
00:35:40,706 --> 00:35:43,436
...even date other people,
as long as they end up together...

544
00:35:43,709 --> 00:35:46,405
...in the end. As long
as they end up together, right?

545
00:35:46,678 --> 00:35:47,736
Yeah.

546
00:35:48,013 --> 00:35:53,679
This is fun. You know, I'm gonna go
because my sister is getting married.

547
00:35:53,919 --> 00:35:55,853
It's an on-again, off-again,
on-again thing.

548
00:35:56,088 --> 00:35:59,683
She's freaking out, treating me like
her assistant so I'm running all over.

549
00:35:59,925 --> 00:36:02,359
I'm really glad we had this talk,
you know?

550
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:07,464
Dude. You check out that sandwich
they got downstairs?

551
00:36:07,699 --> 00:36:09,894
Bread is, like,
two slices of freaking pizza, man.

552
00:36:10,135 --> 00:36:11,363
Only in America. Fuck me.

553
00:36:11,603 --> 00:36:15,039
<i>Clean air probably shouldn't stink
like flaming ass nougat.</i>

554
00:36:15,274 --> 00:36:17,208
I got a real fucking tough guy
over here.

555
00:36:17,442 --> 00:36:20,843
I got a guy on the verge of a five-state
killing spree. Do you wanna?

556
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:23,138
Ready? Three, two, one.

557
00:36:23,415 --> 00:36:26,350
- Let me transfer you to my supervisor.
- Let me transfer you to my supervisor.

558
00:36:26,618 --> 00:36:28,916
- Make me proud.
- Kill it.

559
00:36:29,555 --> 00:36:31,580
Hi, this is Supervisor Eugene Lenay.

560
00:36:31,823 --> 00:36:33,688
- How may I help you?
- How may I help you?

561
00:36:35,561 --> 00:36:37,028
- Please hold.
- Please hold.

562
00:36:39,932 --> 00:36:42,025
Treat her like a bowling ball.

563
00:36:42,267 --> 00:36:43,495
Strike.

564
00:36:43,735 --> 00:36:45,362
Dust, hold on one second, all right?

565
00:36:45,604 --> 00:36:48,698
Sir, I looked into the problem
and it'll actually fix itself.

566
00:36:48,974 --> 00:36:50,464
- What's up, kid?
- You failed, Tank.

567
00:36:50,742 --> 00:36:52,505
She wants to see other people.

568
00:36:52,778 --> 00:36:54,507
She said she wants
to see other people?

569
00:36:54,746 --> 00:36:57,180
She did. That's why
you're gonna take her out again.

570
00:36:57,449 --> 00:36:59,917
Except this time,
you're gonna get seriously diabolical.

571
00:37:00,152 --> 00:37:02,518
I'm talking public defecation.

572
00:37:02,754 --> 00:37:06,246
Dust, you're freaking me out here,
okay? Tank-ing is a subtle art.

573
00:37:06,491 --> 00:37:09,187
You can't go in there crazy
like a dragon with a hemorrhoid.

574
00:37:09,428 --> 00:37:12,420
Besides, what makes you think
she'd ever wanna speak to me again?

575
00:37:13,665 --> 00:37:15,530
Don't worry, I'm taking care of that.

576
00:37:15,767 --> 00:37:18,031
No, you're not. You do... Dust.

577
00:37:18,437 --> 00:37:19,870
<i>Don't do anything, okay? Listen.</i>

578
00:37:21,607 --> 00:37:24,167
I have to teach a training seminar
10 minutes ago. Dusty?

579
00:37:26,345 --> 00:37:27,676
All right.

580
00:37:29,648 --> 00:37:31,809
- You're late, Tank.
- I know.

581
00:37:32,751 --> 00:37:34,309
- You're Tank, right?
- Are you a cop?

582
00:37:34,553 --> 00:37:37,317
No, Roger's friend Sonny
said you fix things.

583
00:37:37,556 --> 00:37:38,648
Walk with me.

584
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:39,914
- You're late.
- Thank you.

585
00:37:40,158 --> 00:37:43,286
I'm going crazy without her.
Shit-in-the-bed-and-roll-around crazy.

586
00:37:43,528 --> 00:37:44,517
- You're late.
- Shut up.

587
00:37:44,763 --> 00:37:47,061
Okay, religious girl.
How do I bump into her?

588
00:37:47,299 --> 00:37:48,357
- You're late.
- No shit.

589
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,363
She's a high-school English teacher.

590
00:37:50,602 --> 00:37:53,730
Guy can't really hang around a
high school these days, unfortunately.

591
00:37:53,972 --> 00:37:55,872
- She gets her hair done Tuesdays.
- Love it.

592
00:37:56,141 --> 00:37:59,633
What'd you do? Foot in your mouth?
Foot-long in somebody's mouth? Facts.

593
00:37:59,911 --> 00:38:03,142
Let's say you're gonna have to be
a real asshole to make me look good.

594
00:38:03,382 --> 00:38:04,815
It's what I do.

595
00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:07,211
- You're late.
- Yes.

596
00:38:07,452 --> 00:38:09,647
Everybody, you're late.
Don't let it happen again.

597
00:38:09,888 --> 00:38:11,150
I'm Tank and I will be brief.

598
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:13,756
Here at Airmeister
we have two rules.

599
00:38:13,992 --> 00:38:15,892
No refunds.

600
00:38:16,128 --> 00:38:20,087
The beauty of an air purifier is that
nobody can prove that it doesn't work.

601
00:38:20,332 --> 00:38:23,597
Amanda, you saucy tart.
I want somebody really pissed off.

602
00:38:23,835 --> 00:38:26,099
I'm talking about DEFCON 2
level of anger.

603
00:38:26,338 --> 00:38:27,566
Who do you got for me, baby?

604
00:38:27,806 --> 00:38:31,799
<i>I have just the one for you. She's
furious and asked for you by name.</i>

605
00:38:32,077 --> 00:38:33,544
Put her through.

606
00:38:36,148 --> 00:38:40,050
Tank Turner, Customer Satisfaction.
How may I help you?

607
00:38:40,285 --> 00:38:42,116
<i>Before we even discuss
what I received...</i>

608
00:38:42,354 --> 00:38:44,049
<i>... which is a whole other mystery...</i>

609
00:38:44,289 --> 00:38:46,154
...I demand an explanation
for yesterday.

610
00:38:46,391 --> 00:38:49,360
Ma'am, I'm fully concerned.
What happened yesterday?

611
00:38:49,594 --> 00:38:51,653
Are you gay?
Or are you just an asshole?

612
00:38:51,897 --> 00:38:56,527
Oh, ma'am. Profanity is superfluous
because no verbal affront...

613
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:59,828
...could be as devastating to me
as your dissatisfaction.

614
00:39:00,072 --> 00:39:01,539
Dissatisfaction?

615
00:39:01,773 --> 00:39:06,210
Yes, I mean if the unit's performance
or lack thereof has left you frustrated...

616
00:39:06,445 --> 00:39:09,710
See, I never saw your unit. I gave
you a chance and you didn't deliver.

617
00:39:09,948 --> 00:39:11,609
Ma'am, you're upset.

618
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:15,752
I'm upset. I'm upset that you will
never, ever know what it's like...

619
00:39:15,987 --> 00:39:19,855
...to sit on a hot, sweaty
summer night...

620
00:39:20,092 --> 00:39:23,823
...and let that unit blow
its glorious bounty all over your face.

621
00:39:24,796 --> 00:39:26,923
You think after the shit
you put me through...

622
00:39:27,165 --> 00:39:30,896
...that I called just so
you could talk dirty to me?

623
00:39:31,136 --> 00:39:33,627
I gave you a one-time
free hall pass for sex.

624
00:39:33,872 --> 00:39:35,362
<i>Good sex. Hot sex.</i>

625
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:38,404
l... l... I fucking roofied myself.

626
00:39:40,612 --> 00:39:41,943
I'm a little confused. Amanda?

627
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:43,943
<i>You're confused?
That makes two of us...</i>

628
00:39:44,182 --> 00:39:47,242
...because I don't know what kind
of asshole acts like an asshole...

629
00:39:47,486 --> 00:39:51,479
...and then when it actually comes
time to be an asshole, walks away.

630
00:39:51,723 --> 00:39:53,520
Like a total asshole.

631
00:39:53,759 --> 00:39:56,353
Making me look like
an even bigger asshole...

632
00:39:56,595 --> 00:40:01,794
...for offering some big-ass asshole
asshole-sex in the first place.

633
00:40:02,033 --> 00:40:04,001
What kind of asshole are you?

634
00:40:06,538 --> 00:40:08,699
This is actually a personal call.

635
00:40:09,007 --> 00:40:10,736
Dude, you are so hired.

636
00:40:11,243 --> 00:40:13,074
Excuse me for a second.

637
00:40:13,478 --> 00:40:14,843
Shit.

638
00:40:15,347 --> 00:40:16,541
Asshole.

639
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:34,224
Sorry. Offer expired.

640
00:40:40,405 --> 00:40:44,865
Did you really think roses and a poem
would give you a second chance?

641
00:40:45,143 --> 00:40:47,509
You rhymed "apology"
with "apologetically."

642
00:40:47,746 --> 00:40:50,078
- I'm...
- I just felt bad, okay?

643
00:40:50,315 --> 00:40:52,249
You're right,
I do owe you an explanation.

644
00:40:52,484 --> 00:40:54,952
I didn't sleep with you
because you're not attractive.

645
00:40:55,187 --> 00:40:56,518
- There, I said it.
- Oh, thanks.

646
00:40:56,755 --> 00:40:58,746
Thank you so much
because you saved me...

647
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:01,481
...from what could've been
the worst decision of my life.

648
00:41:01,726 --> 00:41:03,785
- And I've eaten sushi in Tijuana.
- One-nothing.

649
00:41:04,029 --> 00:41:06,623
You're below my standards.
Even for a one-night pity fuck.

650
00:41:06,865 --> 00:41:10,961
- And I've taken down some real hogs.
- Yeah, hogs, cows, sheep.

651
00:41:11,203 --> 00:41:13,569
I bet your sex life is
a regular heavy-petting zoo.

652
00:41:13,805 --> 00:41:15,932
You know what?
You're what we call a two-bagger.

653
00:41:16,174 --> 00:41:18,165
That means I have to wear
a bag on my head...

654
00:41:18,443 --> 00:41:20,707
...just in case
the one on yours breaks.

655
00:41:21,246 --> 00:41:22,838
You sure it's not just a size thing?

656
00:41:23,114 --> 00:41:26,880
Because it's gotta be tough standing at
a urinal, pissing on your own testicles.

657
00:41:27,118 --> 00:41:28,983
At least I can hide my shame
in my pants.

658
00:41:29,221 --> 00:41:30,882
What really sucks is having an ass...

659
00:41:31,122 --> 00:41:34,649
...the size of a miniature
Mediterranean donkey. That suck...

660
00:41:35,494 --> 00:41:37,223
- Don't...
- You think that's too big?

661
00:41:37,462 --> 00:41:39,726
You think that's too small?

662
00:41:57,983 --> 00:42:00,543
So you said do nothing,
but I did something, totally small.

663
00:42:00,785 --> 00:42:03,913
I sent her a couple hundred bucks
worth of roses and a kick-ass poem.

664
00:42:04,155 --> 00:42:05,952
A few stanzas, no big deal.
Did she call?

665
00:42:06,458 --> 00:42:07,618
No, she didn't.

666
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:10,692
Dusty, these women, they have
a way of getting into our head.

667
00:42:10,929 --> 00:42:12,829
I'm gonna give you
some fresh perspective.

668
00:42:13,064 --> 00:42:15,055
Listen to me.
This girl, I'm getting a hunch.

669
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:17,495
She's built for destruction.
You can't trust her.

670
00:42:17,736 --> 00:42:20,728
You know who you have to trust,
Dusty? Each other.

671
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:24,372
Yeah. It's time to let her go.
Maybe get some... You know.

672
00:42:24,643 --> 00:42:26,338
Just let her go. Move on.

673
00:42:26,611 --> 00:42:28,943
You want me to move on?

674
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:32,638
Give up. Want me to give up. That's
your big plan? I should just give up?

675
00:42:32,918 --> 00:42:36,046
That doesn't quite work for me, okay?
That doesn't quite work for me.

676
00:42:36,288 --> 00:42:37,949
I'm not some sort of misogynist...

677
00:42:38,189 --> 00:42:41,317
...that can just swap out women
like they were batteries, okay?

678
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:44,393
I love her, Tank. I care more
about this girl than I do myself.

679
00:42:44,629 --> 00:42:46,961
- You will never understand that.
- It's new to me.

680
00:42:47,198 --> 00:42:49,359
She said she wants to be friends.

681
00:42:51,403 --> 00:42:53,030
You know what? I'll give her a friend.

682
00:42:54,773 --> 00:42:56,502
I'll be the best goddamn friend
she ever had.

683
00:43:27,572 --> 00:43:28,800
Today was a good day for us.

684
00:43:29,074 --> 00:43:31,338
We made eye contact,
although I couldn't gauge...

685
00:43:32,811 --> 00:43:33,800
I gotta run.

686
00:43:45,657 --> 00:43:46,589
<i>Turn.</i>

687
00:43:54,332 --> 00:43:55,890
She's really tough to read.

688
00:43:56,134 --> 00:43:57,431
Really tough to read.

689
00:43:57,669 --> 00:44:01,935
I felt like... I felt like
she was a bit distracted.

690
00:44:04,442 --> 00:44:06,706
Totally. Hey, can we do this later?

691
00:44:42,747 --> 00:44:44,510
It's hot.

692
00:44:49,254 --> 00:44:50,846
Where you going?

693
00:45:14,312 --> 00:45:16,439
She's seeing someone.

694
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:20,081
Dusty.

695
00:45:20,318 --> 00:45:22,809
What are you doing?
You're scaring the shit out of me.

696
00:45:23,054 --> 00:45:25,614
Sitting in the dark like a vampire,
you creepy weirdo.

697
00:45:25,857 --> 00:45:27,825
She's seeing someone.

698
00:45:28,993 --> 00:45:32,485
We don't go out at night.
I get her voice mail after 10.

699
00:45:32,731 --> 00:45:34,722
She's seeing someone.

700
00:45:34,966 --> 00:45:37,594
- And I'm gonna find out who.
- I'm gonna take back "weirdo."

701
00:45:37,836 --> 00:45:40,327
You're giving off more of
a full-blown serial psycho...

702
00:45:40,572 --> 00:45:42,403
...crawlspace-full-of-skin-sombreros
vibe.

703
00:45:42,674 --> 00:45:43,868
Stop. Intervention time.

704
00:45:44,142 --> 00:45:46,610
It's time to forget about Alexis.
Look at me, all right?

705
00:45:46,878 --> 00:45:51,542
It's time to wipe the cobwebs
off your cock and stick something.

706
00:45:51,916 --> 00:45:53,679
I don't think she'd be cool with that.

707
00:45:53,918 --> 00:45:57,354
Look at me, please. You definitely...
You don't need her permission.

708
00:45:57,589 --> 00:45:58,715
You need to get laid.

709
00:45:58,957 --> 00:46:01,619
And if you'll listen to me,
I bet I could make that happen.

710
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:05,091
This is one of the most important
things that any man can do.

711
00:46:05,330 --> 00:46:06,763
A haircut?

712
00:46:07,232 --> 00:46:09,132
Yes, Dusty, a haircut. Look at me.

713
00:46:09,367 --> 00:46:11,631
You look like Chewbacca and
Sasquatch had a baby...

714
00:46:11,870 --> 00:46:14,236
...the baby took a shit,
and that shit was blinded...

715
00:46:14,472 --> 00:46:16,099
...moments before styling your hair.

716
00:46:16,341 --> 00:46:19,139
- A bit harsh.
- Appointment for Dusty, please.

717
00:46:19,410 --> 00:46:21,002
Grab a seat.

718
00:46:22,947 --> 00:46:25,415
Great article. I've read that.
Sorry to interrupt.

719
00:46:26,718 --> 00:46:29,209
My associate here is looking for
a stylist he can trust.

720
00:46:29,454 --> 00:46:33,652
And this place was recommended to
us by a woman in our prayer group.

721
00:46:34,359 --> 00:46:36,691
Well, is he looking
for something simple or?

722
00:46:36,928 --> 00:46:39,522
Maybe a what-would-Jesus-'do.

723
00:46:43,368 --> 00:46:45,859
- I'm Hilary.
- Hilary, my name is Tank.

724
00:46:46,104 --> 00:46:47,969
- This is Dustin.
- Hi.

725
00:46:50,008 --> 00:46:53,205
So I've got an $85 haircut
so you could have a meet-cute?

726
00:46:53,478 --> 00:46:55,412
Oh, it's $ 110. Worth every penny.

727
00:46:55,647 --> 00:46:57,478
In return,
I'm gonna get you a date with...

728
00:46:57,715 --> 00:47:01,378
Let's just call her a confidence booster.
A slow, fat one down the middle.

729
00:47:01,619 --> 00:47:03,143
I hope that's a baseball metaphor.

730
00:47:03,388 --> 00:47:06,448
This pitch is in your wheelhouse.
Grand slam, upper deck. Game over.

731
00:47:06,691 --> 00:47:09,216
- Hey, beauty queen.
- Hey, I have a question. I'm sorry.

732
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:11,485
I've got these little...
Is there any way...?

733
00:47:11,729 --> 00:47:13,458
Yeah.

734
00:47:14,632 --> 00:47:16,099
- Shit.
- I'm so sorry.

735
00:47:16,334 --> 00:47:18,666
No, I'm sorry. Sorry.

736
00:47:18,903 --> 00:47:22,634
- Is there any other way we could...?
- Yeah, okay.

737
00:47:22,907 --> 00:47:25,307
Guess what.
We're all set for tonight.

738
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:27,671
Okay, hold still.

739
00:47:29,113 --> 00:47:32,207
What about, like, frosting my tips?

740
00:47:32,450 --> 00:47:33,644
What are you, a Mini-Wheat?

741
00:47:33,885 --> 00:47:36,752
Listen, this girl's not Alexis.
She's got a bed built for sex...

742
00:47:36,988 --> 00:47:39,047
...not stuffed animals.
- Wait, what?

743
00:47:39,290 --> 00:47:42,157
How do you know that Alexis
has stuffed animals on her bed?

744
00:47:51,669 --> 00:47:52,636
- Wait.
- Oh, my.

745
00:47:52,871 --> 00:47:55,533
- Fuck.
- Oh, my God...

746
00:47:55,773 --> 00:47:58,139
This stuff happens in salons.
Sometimes it's fixable.

747
00:47:58,409 --> 00:48:00,274
- Tell him it's fixable.
- I'm gonna throw up.

748
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:02,274
Makeup, little shading,
maybe some glue.

749
00:48:02,513 --> 00:48:03,912
How about an eyebrow toupee?

750
00:48:04,148 --> 00:48:06,241
- Where's my eyebrow?
- I don't know what to say.

751
00:48:06,484 --> 00:48:09,351
Oh, God, kill me. Kill me. Kill me!
Where's my eyebrow?

752
00:48:09,587 --> 00:48:10,576
That's a new look.

753
00:48:10,822 --> 00:48:13,586
- You can fix it, right?
- Sure, just pop into my DeLorean.

754
00:48:13,825 --> 00:48:15,452
- It's in the back.
- Don't be a bitch.

755
00:48:15,693 --> 00:48:18,662
- You're the bitch, bitch.
- Hey, gossip girls. Focus on my friend.

756
00:48:18,897 --> 00:48:21,491
- He's follicly deformed.
- Fuck my fucking mother.

757
00:48:21,733 --> 00:48:25,260
Let's come up with this... Dusty, unless
one's missing, nobody's gonna notice.

758
00:48:25,503 --> 00:48:26,561
Yeah.

759
00:48:26,804 --> 00:48:30,535
- Come here. Come here, sit down.
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

760
00:48:31,242 --> 00:48:33,233
You gotta be brave, man.

761
00:48:34,345 --> 00:48:36,040
Oh, my God.

762
00:48:36,714 --> 00:48:38,511
- Do it. It's good.
- Come on. It's gonna...

763
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:41,082
You know what?
I think it's gonna look great.

764
00:48:41,319 --> 00:48:44,618
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- It's gonna be really hot.

765
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:47,688
- It better be hot.
- Yeah.

766
00:48:50,828 --> 00:48:52,489
Fuck.

767
00:48:53,298 --> 00:48:55,926
Bad, bad times.

768
00:48:57,735 --> 00:48:59,430
Oh, my fucking shit.

769
00:49:01,272 --> 00:49:02,796
I'm coming.

770
00:49:05,643 --> 00:49:07,975
Oh, those are lovely.

771
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:12,546
And I see
you've got a hairstyle change.

772
00:49:12,784 --> 00:49:16,584
- True.
- Claire, he's here.

773
00:49:16,821 --> 00:49:18,482
Come on in. She'll be right out.

774
00:49:20,425 --> 00:49:24,589
I'm sorry, I was
under the impression that we...

775
00:49:24,829 --> 00:49:29,357
Us? No.
Tank said you needed a lay-up.

776
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:31,158
Are you calling me a lay-up?

777
00:49:31,402 --> 00:49:33,734
No. God, no. No.

778
00:49:37,442 --> 00:49:39,433
They told me you were taller.

779
00:49:40,812 --> 00:49:43,246
Just for peace of mind,
the father of this child is?

780
00:49:43,514 --> 00:49:47,041
In the middle of a brutal divorce
with the mother of this child.

781
00:49:47,285 --> 00:49:48,513
Cool.

782
00:49:48,753 --> 00:49:50,880
I mean, not cool.
That's not cool. But... But...

783
00:49:51,122 --> 00:49:52,248
Here you go.

784
00:49:52,490 --> 00:49:54,822
Lilies. Thoughtful.

785
00:49:58,529 --> 00:50:01,157
- Sorry.
- I don't wanna give them up.

786
00:50:01,399 --> 00:50:02,798
- Thanks.
- I told you.

787
00:50:03,034 --> 00:50:04,934
My friend said
he was one of the good guys.

788
00:50:05,169 --> 00:50:08,161
I don't know if I would say
I'm one of the...

789
00:50:08,406 --> 00:50:12,069
I've been known to be
a bit of a dog sometimes.

790
00:50:12,944 --> 00:50:16,436
How cute,
he's trying to convince himself.

791
00:50:16,714 --> 00:50:19,376
Oh, no, you're a sweetheart,
and that's okay.

792
00:50:19,617 --> 00:50:23,280
I mean, Claire needs someone like you
after the mess she's been through.

793
00:50:23,521 --> 00:50:25,819
Someone nice.

794
00:50:26,057 --> 00:50:29,356
Nice is nice.

795
00:50:29,594 --> 00:50:30,993
- Should I take those?
- Oh, yes.

796
00:50:32,697 --> 00:50:34,665
I'm sorry, sitter's running a bit late.

797
00:50:34,899 --> 00:50:37,629
Can I get you something
to drink, cutie?

798
00:50:41,139 --> 00:50:43,164
- Yeah, actually, as a matter of fact.
- Okay.

799
00:50:43,408 --> 00:50:44,875
You can.

800
00:50:47,345 --> 00:50:49,108
I'll have what he's having.

801
00:50:49,347 --> 00:50:51,713
- What the fuck?
- What just happened?

802
00:50:51,949 --> 00:50:54,281
- He just said he wants...
- I just, I said...

803
00:50:54,519 --> 00:50:56,680
He looked at Liam,
licked his lips and said:

804
00:50:56,921 --> 00:50:59,355
- "I'll have what he's having."
- Okay, but what I meant...

805
00:50:59,590 --> 00:51:01,717
- What does that even mean?
- What does that mean?

806
00:51:01,959 --> 00:51:04,587
- I'll ex... Let me explain.
- You want me to lactate for you?

807
00:51:04,829 --> 00:51:05,887
- No.
- You want my big...

808
00:51:06,130 --> 00:51:09,827
...life-giving, mothering, nurturing
breasts in your filthy mouth?

809
00:51:10,268 --> 00:51:12,236
What's wrong with you?
There's a child here.

810
00:51:12,470 --> 00:51:14,097
- She's got a child.
- I see the child.

811
00:51:14,338 --> 00:51:16,033
- A child.
- It is a child. I was just...

812
00:51:16,274 --> 00:51:18,037
- You wanna breast-feed.
- What?

813
00:51:18,309 --> 00:51:19,708
That's what this is.

814
00:51:19,944 --> 00:51:24,040
You're some fetishistic monster
who preys on women.

815
00:51:24,282 --> 00:51:27,342
- Okay, I was just kidding.
- You're disgusting.

816
00:51:27,585 --> 00:51:31,715
I was gonna throw myself at you,
and you...

817
00:51:32,423 --> 00:51:33,651
I was just joking...

818
00:51:33,891 --> 00:51:35,256
- Can we just start over?
- Hi.

819
00:51:35,493 --> 00:51:39,054
- I just wanna start...
- Sorry, Laney, we don't need a sitter.

820
00:51:39,297 --> 00:51:42,289
Groucho here made a mark
about suckling at my teat...

821
00:51:42,533 --> 00:51:44,694
...and stealing my baby's milk...

822
00:51:44,936 --> 00:51:46,995
...and is consequently leaving.
- Okay.

823
00:51:47,238 --> 00:51:49,399
- Get the fuck out!
- Okay, I'm really sorry.

824
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:51,835
- I'm just... I'm sorry.
- No. No more. Just get out.

825
00:51:52,110 --> 00:51:54,578
- I'm really sorry.
- Go, go.

826
00:51:55,746 --> 00:51:57,213
Come here.

827
00:52:02,053 --> 00:52:04,453
You got shot down...

828
00:52:04,689 --> 00:52:07,658
...in a blaze of glory.

829
00:52:08,593 --> 00:52:10,493
You cost me a job, man.

830
00:52:10,728 --> 00:52:14,755
I'm sorry. Let me make it up to you.
How much?

831
00:52:14,999 --> 00:52:17,729
- Forty... Fifty if it's past 11.
- Okay.

832
00:52:17,969 --> 00:52:21,029
Here's 60 for your trouble.
I'm really sorry.

833
00:52:21,272 --> 00:52:22,933
Sweet.

834
00:52:23,174 --> 00:52:26,940
Hey, for another 60,
I'll jerk you off in the parking garage.

835
00:52:27,912 --> 00:52:31,575
Jesus. Do I really
look that desperate?

836
00:52:35,620 --> 00:52:39,351
There's no milk, but I'll let you suck tit
for 5 bucks a minute.

837
00:52:42,827 --> 00:52:44,385
Excuse me.

838
00:53:13,291 --> 00:53:15,316
Alexis!

839
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:17,528
Alexis!

840
00:53:18,529 --> 00:53:20,156
Alexis, I love you!

841
00:53:20,698 --> 00:53:24,566
I love you, Alexis.
I can't just be friends, okay?

842
00:53:25,169 --> 00:53:27,364
Alexis, come to the door.

843
00:53:29,774 --> 00:53:31,435
Come on.

844
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:33,532
- Oh, Dobler.
- Hey, hey.

845
00:53:33,811 --> 00:53:37,645
Hi there. I'm so sorry,
your BFF's upstairs with another guy.

846
00:53:38,149 --> 00:53:40,413
Holy shit, what is
going on with your eyebrows?

847
00:53:40,651 --> 00:53:44,451
- Seriously, I think there's something...
- I'm sorry. She's got a guy up there?

848
00:53:44,689 --> 00:53:47,385
But they're just hanging out, right?
Is she seeing this guy?

849
00:53:47,625 --> 00:53:49,684
No, no, no.
No, no, just an occasional bang.

850
00:53:49,927 --> 00:53:52,327
No, no. God, no. How many times
have they gone out?

851
00:53:52,563 --> 00:53:55,623
- How many times have they...? Not...
- They don't go out ever.

852
00:53:55,866 --> 00:53:58,664
No, he just comes over and
he bangs, and then he leaves.

853
00:53:59,170 --> 00:54:01,229
- What?
- You know, she's doing this all for you.

854
00:54:01,472 --> 00:54:04,908
Think about it. She's up there with
her knees by her ears, getting railed...

855
00:54:05,176 --> 00:54:07,770
...so one day she can settle down
with a nice boy like you.

856
00:54:08,045 --> 00:54:09,478
- I love her. I love her.
- Dustin.

857
00:54:09,747 --> 00:54:12,545
- You'd better be ready. I'm serious.
- Alexis.

858
00:54:12,950 --> 00:54:15,282
Alexis. Ale...

859
00:54:18,589 --> 00:54:21,422
Dustin, what are you doing here?

860
00:54:22,293 --> 00:54:24,659
- What is he doing here?
- Well, this is my...

861
00:54:24,895 --> 00:54:26,624
It's Tank.

862
00:54:28,399 --> 00:54:31,300
- This is the guy you're with?
- No, I'm not with anyone.

863
00:54:31,535 --> 00:54:33,298
I'm not... We're not together.

864
00:54:33,537 --> 00:54:36,233
I mean, no offense, Tank,
but we're not...

865
00:54:36,574 --> 00:54:39,099
I told you. I told you that
I was gonna get out there...

866
00:54:39,377 --> 00:54:42,141
...and I was gonna see other people
and I was gonna date...

867
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:44,280
...and get some experience
under my belt...

868
00:54:44,515 --> 00:54:48,542
...and live my life a little bit. For once
in my life, do something like that...

869
00:54:48,786 --> 00:54:50,981
...and that's exactly what I'm doing.

870
00:54:54,191 --> 00:54:56,091
- Should I go?
- Yes.

871
00:54:56,661 --> 00:54:57,787
- I'm gonna go.
- No, no, no.

872
00:54:58,029 --> 00:54:58,927
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Tank.

873
00:54:59,163 --> 00:55:01,529
- You know what? I'll go.
- No, you don't go, you stay.

874
00:55:01,766 --> 00:55:05,031
I should get going, I have a big day
tomorrow. My roommate's moving out.

875
00:55:05,269 --> 00:55:06,236
I have shit to do too.

876
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:07,562
- Really?
- Bye.

877
00:55:07,805 --> 00:55:09,830
- I'll call you later.
- I'll call you later.

878
00:55:10,107 --> 00:55:11,335
- No, after you.
- No, you go.

879
00:55:11,609 --> 00:55:13,304
No, no, please, Tank. You go first.

880
00:55:13,577 --> 00:55:15,101
- All right.
- Fine.

881
00:55:18,883 --> 00:55:21,181
- How can I trust you?
- I don't know.

882
00:55:21,419 --> 00:55:25,150
Hey, I wasn't kidding.
You're out by tomorrow morning.

883
00:55:27,558 --> 00:55:29,116
Dusty...

884
00:55:39,370 --> 00:55:41,065
I thought so.

885
00:55:46,844 --> 00:55:49,472
So we remember
the words of Betty Friedan:

886
00:55:49,847 --> 00:55:53,943
"A woman has got to be able to say,
and not feel guilty:

887
00:55:55,419 --> 00:55:57,011
'Who am I...

888
00:55:58,055 --> 00:56:00,546
...and what do I want out of life?"'

889
00:56:01,359 --> 00:56:03,850
That's why my Women's Studies
program will be focused...

890
00:56:04,095 --> 00:56:08,657
...on the liberation,
celebration and exploration...

891
00:56:12,436 --> 00:56:13,767
...of you...

892
00:56:17,575 --> 00:56:19,008
...and you...

893
00:56:22,046 --> 00:56:23,570
...and you.

894
00:56:25,483 --> 00:56:29,385
Enjoy your weekend,
and please try to do so responsibly.

895
00:56:32,323 --> 00:56:35,121
The man is Oprah.

896
00:56:40,064 --> 00:56:43,033
Would you all excuse me
for just one second, please?

897
00:56:47,838 --> 00:56:49,703
- Sherman, Sherman, Sherman.
- Hey, Dad.

898
00:56:50,174 --> 00:56:54,008
If there's anything else I can get for
you, I'm always available, professor.

899
00:56:54,245 --> 00:56:58,443
One of my teaching assistants, and
a very hard-working young woman.

900
00:57:03,621 --> 00:57:08,217
Last night, I fucked her
within an inch of her life.

901
00:57:08,459 --> 00:57:11,189
True story. I'm jamming
her head through the headboard...

902
00:57:11,429 --> 00:57:13,761
...I flip her over, she screams,
"Give me a choker."

903
00:57:13,998 --> 00:57:17,161
I play the choirboy, "What's that?"
Star wipe to five minutes later...

904
00:57:17,401 --> 00:57:20,268
...she's bucking like an epileptic
at a strobe-light convention.

905
00:57:20,504 --> 00:57:21,471
I'm getting scared.

906
00:57:21,705 --> 00:57:24,435
As I'm working out the 911 phone call
in my head, she goes:

907
00:57:28,679 --> 00:57:30,647
Like an air bag.

908
00:57:33,117 --> 00:57:34,345
Now, that's a Tuesday night.

909
00:57:35,219 --> 00:57:36,345
You got a good gig, Dad.

910
00:57:37,755 --> 00:57:38,722
How you doing, son?

911
00:57:40,958 --> 00:57:41,925
Dusty kicked me out.

912
00:57:42,159 --> 00:57:45,526
In all fairness, I was accidentally
sleeping with his pseudo-girlfriend...

913
00:57:45,763 --> 00:57:48,231
...but I feel like shit.

914
00:57:48,466 --> 00:57:50,593
Son, let me tell you a story.

915
00:57:50,835 --> 00:57:53,565
December, 1977,
your mother, God rest her soul...

916
00:57:53,804 --> 00:57:56,102
...throws one of her infamous
pot potlucks...

917
00:57:56,340 --> 00:57:59,741
...and I find myself sozzled in
the boathouse with your Aunt Francie.

918
00:58:00,010 --> 00:58:02,376
Now today, some might consider her
to be zaftig...

919
00:58:02,613 --> 00:58:05,514
...but back then,
she could really hang a sundress.

920
00:58:05,749 --> 00:58:08,547
How I yearned for her.

921
00:58:08,786 --> 00:58:11,550
But I refrained because
it was your mother's sister.

922
00:58:11,789 --> 00:58:14,758
- I get it. I fucked up.
- No. No.

923
00:58:14,992 --> 00:58:18,189
The point is, is that two days later,
I banged the shit out of her...

924
00:58:18,429 --> 00:58:22,092
...in the back of a Bonneville while
your mother filled my prescription.

925
00:58:23,734 --> 00:58:25,361
Best Pontiac sex I've ever had.

926
00:58:27,438 --> 00:58:29,303
Okay, so you approve?

927
00:58:31,475 --> 00:58:35,741
Guilt is just one more thing
trying to asphyxiate us during sex.

928
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:39,381
You cheat, you feel bad, you watch TV,
you feel better, you cheat again.

929
00:58:48,993 --> 00:58:51,120
All right, you know what?
This girl's different.

930
00:58:51,362 --> 00:58:55,423
She's smart, she's cool,
she's tough, she's a 10.

931
00:58:56,800 --> 00:59:00,759
Ms. Barber, I must apologize
for my son's antiquated phraseology.

932
00:59:01,005 --> 00:59:03,303
Out of desperation,
he continues to assess women...

933
00:59:03,574 --> 00:59:04,802
...a base-10 value number...

934
00:59:05,075 --> 00:59:07,305
...predicated solely
on their physical countenance.

935
00:59:07,578 --> 00:59:09,045
That's...

936
00:59:09,813 --> 00:59:12,247
- That's wrong, Sherman.
- No problem.

937
00:59:29,433 --> 00:59:32,766
I moved from numbers a long time ago.
You rarely find a 10 outside of L.A.

938
00:59:33,003 --> 00:59:36,063
That's ass-up polyurethane. Really
talking about a one through nine.

939
00:59:36,307 --> 00:59:39,572
It was too constricting.
I'm all about the letters now.

940
00:59:40,210 --> 00:59:41,472
J.

941
00:59:43,547 --> 00:59:45,037
She smells like a J.

942
00:59:45,316 --> 00:59:46,647
E over there in the booth.

943
00:59:47,117 --> 00:59:50,644
An E is a 22 on a scale of 26.

944
00:59:50,888 --> 00:59:52,150
It gets easier with practice.

945
00:59:54,325 --> 00:59:57,192
- S.
- Crop-top here, she would be an F.

946
00:59:57,428 --> 01:00:00,864
No, bad skin. She's a G,
maybe an H without the war paint.

947
01:00:01,098 --> 01:00:04,499
But that cougar over there,
Bo Derek with the blue wrap.

948
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:06,498
- She's a solid L.
- Okay, wait a second.

949
01:00:06,737 --> 01:00:08,796
That woman is 62,
that wrap is a shawl...

950
01:00:09,039 --> 01:00:11,633
...that L is a Y, and
there's a reason they call them Y's.

951
01:00:11,909 --> 01:00:13,536
- Come on.
- Check it.

952
01:00:14,178 --> 01:00:17,045
No, good call, Sherm, good call.

953
01:00:17,314 --> 01:00:19,214
I've gotta get that Lasik.

954
01:00:19,450 --> 01:00:23,011
- So you gonna wing me or what?
- What's the game plan?

955
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,594
Being an educator,
I like to stick to the school grades...

956
01:00:25,837 --> 01:00:28,328
...A, B, C and D.
You, on the other hand...

957
01:00:28,573 --> 01:00:30,973
...should stay with the back 13,
thin out the herd.

958
01:00:31,209 --> 01:00:33,177
Thanks, Dad.
I'm off the market right now.

959
01:00:33,411 --> 01:00:35,902
I told you about this girl.
You know, she...

960
01:00:36,147 --> 01:00:37,808
The other night, we're making love...

961
01:00:38,049 --> 01:00:40,449
...and we're just
laying there afterwards and...

962
01:00:40,685 --> 01:00:43,119
- Sharing the silence?
- Yeah.

963
01:00:43,354 --> 01:00:45,584
What the fuck is wrong with you?

964
01:00:45,857 --> 01:00:47,620
"Making love"?
What are you, Nora Ephron?

965
01:00:47,892 --> 01:00:49,325
<i>Is this some Redbook interview?</i>

966
01:00:49,594 --> 01:00:51,994
You sound like Liberace's
stylist's boyfriend.

967
01:00:52,230 --> 01:00:55,028
"Let's just enjoy the silences
and the caprice together."

968
01:00:55,266 --> 01:00:58,030
- I have no son. I have no son.
- Dad, I dig this girl.

969
01:00:58,269 --> 01:01:00,260
Good, keep talking.
And while you're talking...

970
01:01:00,505 --> 01:01:02,871
...there are cougars on my right
who are clocking us.

971
01:01:03,107 --> 01:01:05,575
- Can you listen?
- Soon as you put on your safari hat...

972
01:01:05,810 --> 01:01:09,302
...and grab your gun.
- Dad, can you just stay here with me?

973
01:01:09,847 --> 01:01:10,814
Of course I can, son.

974
01:01:11,048 --> 01:01:14,279
Since you fucked my chances with
the "Dad" play. Thanks for projecting.

975
01:01:14,519 --> 01:01:17,386
Not to mention the gay-caress
maneuver for the hearing-impaired.

976
01:01:17,655 --> 01:01:20,021
Can't you just be my Dad
for five fucking seconds?

977
01:01:20,258 --> 01:01:24,354
Oh, I'm sorry, you want the real
father-son bullshit. Right this way.

978
01:01:24,595 --> 01:01:27,758
That girl was dating Dusty,
which means she's out of your league.

979
01:01:28,166 --> 01:01:29,463
She was slumming it, Sherman.

980
01:01:31,202 --> 01:01:34,694
"Now, the truth may set you free,
but first it's gonna piss you off."

981
01:01:34,939 --> 01:01:36,406
Gloria Steinem said that.

982
01:01:42,713 --> 01:01:44,908
My son, the booty call.

983
01:01:45,683 --> 01:01:46,945
Thanks for the advice, professor.

984
01:01:57,462 --> 01:01:59,054
Shit.

985
01:02:15,780 --> 01:02:17,805
That was insane.

986
01:02:22,954 --> 01:02:24,751
It was insane, right?

987
01:02:29,427 --> 01:02:30,416
It was...

988
01:02:34,599 --> 01:02:36,624
Hey, can I have some of that?

989
01:02:43,541 --> 01:02:45,031
Who's that guy?

990
01:02:45,543 --> 01:02:48,068
That's Greg, he's an old friend.

991
01:02:50,147 --> 01:02:51,512
Why?

992
01:02:53,284 --> 01:02:57,015
Just I'm seeing, you know,
his arm's a little low on your hip.

993
01:02:57,588 --> 01:03:02,218
One of his hands is almost near
your ass. You know, for a friend.

994
01:03:03,427 --> 01:03:06,089
Did you guys ever hook up? Really?

995
01:03:06,330 --> 01:03:09,356
You're not serious, are you?

996
01:03:10,067 --> 01:03:13,503
No. No, I'm not serious at all.

997
01:03:14,505 --> 01:03:18,942
- I mean, you're in a picture with him.
- Oh, my God, you're serious.

998
01:03:19,744 --> 01:03:21,871
Why don't we have a picture?

999
01:03:24,415 --> 01:03:26,280
I don't know.

1000
01:03:26,884 --> 01:03:29,318
- I can fix that. That's easy.
- No, no, no.

1001
01:03:29,554 --> 01:03:32,682
- No, no. I'm naked. I don't want... Tank.
- Yeah. I know, I want that...

1002
01:03:32,957 --> 01:03:34,549
- Come here. You're pushing me.
- Tank.

1003
01:03:34,825 --> 01:03:36,258
- I'm out of the bed.
- I'm serious.

1004
01:03:36,527 --> 01:03:38,552
- Okay.
- That hurt.

1005
01:03:38,829 --> 01:03:41,161
- I'm tired.
- That really hurt.

1006
01:03:46,604 --> 01:03:49,334
Stupid idea. It's late.

1007
01:03:57,381 --> 01:03:59,849
I gotta work tomorrow.

1008
01:04:00,851 --> 01:04:03,115
Everybody's gotta work tomorrow.

1009
01:04:08,459 --> 01:04:11,326
You don't want me to stay tonight.

1010
01:04:12,830 --> 01:04:15,924
- I just sort of feel like it's...
- Yeah.

1011
01:04:18,035 --> 01:04:20,060
Totally understandable.

1012
01:04:21,005 --> 01:04:22,165
Yeah.

1013
01:06:02,073 --> 01:06:03,870
Hi.

1014
01:06:04,341 --> 01:06:06,434
What happened to 8?

1015
01:06:06,677 --> 01:06:09,840
- Eight's good.
- But you're an hour late.

1016
01:06:10,414 --> 01:06:11,779
Can we make it 9?

1017
01:06:12,016 --> 01:06:14,211
I thought you wanted
to get drinks before dinner.

1018
01:06:14,452 --> 01:06:17,751
I did. And I did.

1019
01:06:18,022 --> 01:06:20,115
Well, I'm not getting in a car
with you.

1020
01:06:20,391 --> 01:06:23,417
Like I tell my students,
even one drink is one drink too many.

1021
01:06:23,694 --> 01:06:27,596
No vehicle necessary, teach.
The place we're going is right here.

1022
01:06:27,865 --> 01:06:29,696
It's good. Let's go.

1023
01:06:43,347 --> 01:06:45,577
This is wrong.

1024
01:06:46,717 --> 01:06:48,150
Let's eat.

1025
01:06:48,385 --> 01:06:49,852
Right there.

1026
01:06:53,824 --> 01:06:57,055
I'm starving. I wanted to show you
this too. Look, it's my new T-shirt.

1027
01:06:58,329 --> 01:07:00,194
"My cock plus your pussy equals..."?

1028
01:07:01,532 --> 01:07:03,363
- "Good times"?
- That's it.

1029
01:07:03,601 --> 01:07:06,570
Welcome to Cheesus Crust,
where pizza is a religious experience.

1030
01:07:06,804 --> 01:07:08,567
How can I ordain your order?

1031
01:07:08,806 --> 01:07:11,673
How is the Pizza of Nazareth?

1032
01:07:11,909 --> 01:07:13,843
People worship it.

1033
01:07:16,046 --> 01:07:18,640
- I'm deeply offended.
- Me too.

1034
01:07:18,883 --> 01:07:20,111
These prices are outrageous.

1035
01:07:20,351 --> 01:07:22,478
Which is why I carry
my Flavor Savior card.

1036
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:26,816
Fifteen percent off,
all who eat here religiously.

1037
01:07:28,225 --> 01:07:30,250
Do you think this is funny?

1038
01:07:33,497 --> 01:07:35,055
Good night.

1039
01:07:36,534 --> 01:07:39,230
- You people are sinners!
- You should have thought of that...

1040
01:07:39,470 --> 01:07:42,803
...19 years ago before you stopped
my mom from going into that clinic.

1041
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:44,735
Have a blessed day.

1042
01:07:47,945 --> 01:07:49,640
Fastest ever.

1043
01:08:13,737 --> 01:08:15,864
Even Jesus had to eat.

1044
01:08:16,674 --> 01:08:19,700
- Don't.
- It was a bad date.

1045
01:08:20,444 --> 01:08:23,572
Well, it was supposed to be
a nice night out.

1046
01:08:23,814 --> 01:08:26,442
You know, my last boyfriend
never took me anywhere.

1047
01:08:26,684 --> 01:08:28,151
Ever.

1048
01:08:28,385 --> 01:08:31,115
He'd text me late at night
to come hang out at his place...

1049
01:08:31,388 --> 01:08:34,585
...like he was ashamed
to be seen with me in public.

1050
01:08:34,859 --> 01:08:38,590
- Please don't cry. Wait. Please?
- I'd make excuses for him, you know?

1051
01:08:38,829 --> 01:08:40,797
He's not using me, I'm using him.

1052
01:08:41,065 --> 01:08:45,092
- And I'm in total control...
- Total control and it's not that serious.

1053
01:08:45,336 --> 01:08:46,963
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1054
01:08:47,204 --> 01:08:48,398
But when that phone rang...

1055
01:08:48,639 --> 01:08:51,039
...my heart leapt, and I was there.
- Totally.

1056
01:08:51,275 --> 01:08:55,041
And now I finally get the chance to
go out on a real date and it's with you.

1057
01:08:55,279 --> 01:08:59,238
- I know, that sucks.
- No, you suck.

1058
01:08:59,483 --> 01:09:02,816
I do. I do suck.

1059
01:09:03,053 --> 01:09:04,782
I suck.

1060
01:09:09,026 --> 01:09:11,859
You must be hungry. Let's go eat.

1061
01:09:14,331 --> 01:09:20,031
My senior year, I take this girl
on a date... Horrible, date from hell.

1062
01:09:20,271 --> 01:09:23,240
About a week later, this frat boy
comes up and he says to me:

1063
01:09:23,474 --> 01:09:25,965
"Only you could make me look good."

1064
01:09:27,511 --> 01:09:29,376
All right? I laughed...

1065
01:09:29,613 --> 01:09:33,572
...until one of his buddies
then came to me and was like:

1066
01:09:33,817 --> 01:09:35,944
"Can you help me with my ex?"

1067
01:09:36,186 --> 01:09:39,246
- Tank was born.
- Yeah. Yeah, really.

1068
01:09:43,294 --> 01:09:46,593
- I'm sorry.
- I understand.

1069
01:09:47,932 --> 01:09:49,263
But...

1070
01:09:49,733 --> 01:09:50,893
...do you enjoy it?

1071
01:09:51,135 --> 01:09:53,365
I'm good at it.
I'm good at being an asshole.

1072
01:09:54,238 --> 01:09:55,865
It's what I do.

1073
01:09:56,473 --> 01:09:59,271
- You're like the anti-Cupid.
- More like the Antichrist.

1074
01:10:01,679 --> 01:10:03,112
Sorry.

1075
01:10:03,347 --> 01:10:06,544
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

1076
01:10:07,484 --> 01:10:10,544
You know, in a cruel, twisted way...

1077
01:10:10,821 --> 01:10:13,346
...you give couples a second chance.

1078
01:10:13,624 --> 01:10:15,057
You're a closet romantic.

1079
01:10:15,859 --> 01:10:18,657
- I don't know about that.
- You are.

1080
01:10:19,330 --> 01:10:21,457
You know you have to
confront this girl, Alexis.

1081
01:10:22,232 --> 01:10:23,699
I can't.

1082
01:10:25,235 --> 01:10:26,224
I can't.

1083
01:10:26,470 --> 01:10:29,166
If you don't do this,
she will never take you seriously.

1084
01:10:29,406 --> 01:10:32,307
You need to march up there
and tell her how you feel.

1085
01:10:33,043 --> 01:10:34,635
Alexis.

1086
01:10:36,847 --> 01:10:39,042
Alexis, it's Tank.

1087
01:10:39,483 --> 01:10:40,848
Yeah.

1088
01:10:44,154 --> 01:10:46,054
I'm just gonna say this.
I'm gonna say it.

1089
01:10:46,290 --> 01:10:49,657
If you value this, us, we...

1090
01:10:49,893 --> 01:10:53,693
...then you will let me take you
on a proper date.

1091
01:10:53,931 --> 01:10:55,694
- In public.
- It's 2 a.m. in the morning.

1092
01:10:55,933 --> 01:10:57,696
Can we do the proper date
another time?

1093
01:11:01,505 --> 01:11:02,904
- Tomorrow.
- Yes.

1094
01:11:03,140 --> 01:11:04,630
Proper date. In public.

1095
01:11:05,309 --> 01:11:06,298
- Get some...
- Good night.

1096
01:11:06,543 --> 01:11:08,704
- Good night.
- Nice shirt.

1097
01:11:25,929 --> 01:11:27,328
Oh, you've gotta be kidding me.

1098
01:11:31,035 --> 01:11:33,094
This is for you.
Have to have a corsage.

1099
01:11:33,337 --> 01:11:35,532
Oh, my God.

1100
01:11:35,773 --> 01:11:39,072
- You gotta be kidding me.
- No, I'm not.

1101
01:11:40,210 --> 01:11:42,269
I never went to prom.

1102
01:11:42,513 --> 01:11:44,140
I remember.

1103
01:11:46,950 --> 01:11:48,975
Oh, yeah, that's right.

1104
01:11:55,993 --> 01:11:58,655
She's got a shank. You might
wanna actually focus on her.

1105
01:11:58,829 --> 01:12:01,992
- They're with me, okay? Thanks.
- Alexis, this is Hilary, our chaperon.

1106
01:12:02,232 --> 01:12:04,723
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

1107
01:12:05,536 --> 01:12:06,503
<i>Thank you.</i>

1108
01:12:08,072 --> 01:12:09,334
You two kids have fun.

1109
01:12:14,278 --> 01:12:16,246
I'm having fun.

1110
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:20,211
Let's set the stage here.
You're 17 years old.

1111
01:12:20,451 --> 01:12:23,249
As you make the mistake of
heading out onto the dance floor...

1112
01:12:23,487 --> 01:12:25,546
...a fine, young chap
stops you on your way...

1113
01:12:25,823 --> 01:12:28,519
Strikingly handsome. Some
would say ruggedly good-looking.

1114
01:12:28,792 --> 01:12:31,693
He stops you and says, "Excuse me,
would you care to dance?"

1115
01:12:31,929 --> 01:12:34,830
- Don't tell me you dance.
- Me?

1116
01:12:35,065 --> 01:12:36,089
Never.

1117
01:12:39,069 --> 01:12:41,196
Oh, my God.

1118
01:12:42,139 --> 01:12:44,972
- Oh, my God.
- That's it. That's all I've got, really.

1119
01:12:50,814 --> 01:12:51,940
No way.

1120
01:12:57,254 --> 01:12:58,243
For you.

1121
01:12:59,389 --> 01:13:01,016
- Let's go.
- No, I can't...

1122
01:13:01,291 --> 01:13:05,022
You're making this embarrassing-
myself-to-be-cute thing really difficult.

1123
01:13:05,262 --> 01:13:06,661
Look at this, check it out.

1124
01:13:09,199 --> 01:13:12,760
- Did you see that little move?
- I saw it. I wanna see more over here.

1125
01:13:39,630 --> 01:13:40,654
I got caught up.

1126
01:14:05,222 --> 01:14:07,315
- Hi.
- Hey.

1127
01:14:31,748 --> 01:14:33,079
Hey.

1128
01:14:37,421 --> 01:14:38,911
Fun, huh?

1129
01:14:39,189 --> 01:14:40,486
Yeah.

1130
01:14:44,595 --> 01:14:47,029
You know you could have
any girl out there, right?

1131
01:14:48,131 --> 01:14:51,123
Hey, dude, look at me.

1132
01:14:51,368 --> 01:14:52,562
Look at this.

1133
01:14:52,803 --> 01:14:54,668
It's not about
what you look like, man.

1134
01:14:54,905 --> 01:14:55,963
It's right here, okay?

1135
01:14:56,206 --> 01:14:59,505
It's attitude, it's how you look at them.
Pretend you don't give a shit...

1136
01:14:59,743 --> 01:15:03,179
...they will be on you like acne.
Guaranteed or your money back.

1137
01:15:04,281 --> 01:15:08,718
So, then, like, why have you been
such a kiss-ass to your girl all night?

1138
01:15:08,952 --> 01:15:10,943
Pulling out chairs,
throwing out compliments.

1139
01:15:11,188 --> 01:15:15,454
I'm on a different plan. You're on a...
What you... What l...

1140
01:15:15,726 --> 01:15:18,092
"Can I wipe your ass, baby?"

1141
01:15:18,495 --> 01:15:21,794
I was trying to help you, but fuck you.

1142
01:15:22,032 --> 01:15:23,260
Fuck you, you hypocrite.

1143
01:15:23,500 --> 01:15:26,060
"Hey nerd, let me give you
some condescending advice."

1144
01:15:26,303 --> 01:15:27,361
Be cruel to women?

1145
01:15:27,604 --> 01:15:29,231
Fat, pathetic, sad dork.

1146
01:15:29,473 --> 01:15:32,442
- Old man at a high-school prom.
- Husky bitch.

1147
01:15:35,479 --> 01:15:38,312
Don't get ahead of yourself here.
And I'm just curious...

1148
01:15:38,548 --> 01:15:40,846
...but are you seeing anybody?
- No.

1149
01:15:41,084 --> 01:15:42,779
No?

1150
01:15:42,986 --> 01:15:45,045
- Are you?
- No.

1151
01:15:45,355 --> 01:15:47,755
What about that awkward night
with that guy?

1152
01:15:47,991 --> 01:15:49,117
You still calling him?

1153
01:15:49,626 --> 01:15:51,787
He kind of disappeared.

1154
01:15:52,362 --> 01:15:54,125
I haven't heard from him since he quit.

1155
01:15:54,364 --> 01:15:56,764
Maybe you could call him. You know?

1156
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,491
See how he's holding up kind of thing.

1157
01:15:59,970 --> 01:16:02,200
- What?
- Or don't.

1158
01:16:02,439 --> 01:16:04,999
It's... It's your choice.
I mean, I'm just saying...

1159
01:16:05,242 --> 01:16:08,268
- No, I know. It's sweet.
- Polite.

1160
01:16:09,446 --> 01:16:13,212
Even if it is a part of your whole show
that you've got going on tonight.

1161
01:16:13,550 --> 01:16:16,144
You're pulling out all the stops.

1162
01:16:16,720 --> 01:16:19,518
Sweet Tank.
Sweet Tank is way into me.

1163
01:16:23,994 --> 01:16:26,622
You know what, though?
You're right. I should call him.

1164
01:16:28,965 --> 01:16:30,865
I should call him.

1165
01:16:36,073 --> 01:16:37,597
I think I'll say good night.

1166
01:16:37,841 --> 01:16:39,832
- Yes, I will be going.
- Wait, what?

1167
01:16:40,077 --> 01:16:41,510
Good night.

1168
01:16:42,479 --> 01:16:44,379
I got what I wanted. A real first date.

1169
01:16:44,614 --> 01:16:47,242
Although this may be the worst
possible time to admit it...

1170
01:16:47,484 --> 01:16:50,544
...l'm not good at the no-sex thing.
So I'll see you later.

1171
01:16:50,821 --> 01:16:53,346
Hey, if you insist on celibacy...

1172
01:16:53,623 --> 01:16:56,456
...do you think we can have
our second official date on July 7?

1173
01:16:56,693 --> 01:16:58,388
Because my sister is getting married.

1174
01:16:58,628 --> 01:17:01,495
And it would be great...

1175
01:17:01,765 --> 01:17:03,995
...if you'd come with me.

1176
01:17:04,735 --> 01:17:07,135
Yes, I can do that.
But I'm gonna walk away...

1177
01:17:07,371 --> 01:17:09,566
...because...
- You're missing out.

1178
01:17:10,707 --> 01:17:13,198
After a while, crocodile.

1179
01:17:19,683 --> 01:17:22,413
You know, it was really cool
of you to call, Alexis.

1180
01:17:22,652 --> 01:17:25,621
Lunch, wedding errands.
Just like old times, huh?

1181
01:17:25,889 --> 01:17:28,858
I haven't seen you since I took
my leave of absence from work.

1182
01:17:29,126 --> 01:17:30,559
Yeah, I heard you quit.

1183
01:17:30,827 --> 01:17:34,319
Oh, no, no, no, I just...
I took a sabbatical. A sabbatical.

1184
01:17:34,564 --> 01:17:36,464
I just wanted to do
some soul-searching.

1185
01:17:44,274 --> 01:17:47,141
- My sister picked it out.
- Well, you should thank her.

1186
01:17:47,377 --> 01:17:50,244
- The whole world should thank her.
- Well, you're welcome.

1187
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:52,880
- Speaking of the devil.
- Oh, my gosh.

1188
01:17:53,116 --> 01:17:55,050
I love it. I love it so much.

1189
01:17:55,285 --> 01:17:57,276
This is my friend, Dustin.
This is my sister.

1190
01:17:57,521 --> 01:17:58,647
- Oh, hi.
- No. Get over here.

1191
01:17:58,922 --> 01:18:00,651
- What?
- Congratulations.

1192
01:18:00,924 --> 01:18:03,119
Alexis will not shut up about you,
the wedding...

1193
01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:05,726
That was really smart.
That was so smart, yeah.

1194
01:18:05,962 --> 01:18:08,021
See, I brought mine too. Hi.

1195
01:18:08,265 --> 01:18:12,531
It's really the only opinion
that means anything these days.

1196
01:18:12,769 --> 01:18:13,827
Oh, my gosh.

1197
01:18:14,638 --> 01:18:16,833
You have to see my dress.
Great, now.

1198
01:18:20,110 --> 01:18:21,975
- Yeah, I did it when...
- Alexis, I'm sorry.

1199
01:18:22,212 --> 01:18:24,874
I'm the...
I'm the dress-shopping gay pal?

1200
01:18:25,115 --> 01:18:27,675
I just think that now's
not the time to set her straight.

1201
01:18:27,918 --> 01:18:29,476
She's a little crazy, she's manic.

1202
01:18:29,719 --> 01:18:32,051
I get that we're in slow-down mode...

1203
01:18:32,322 --> 01:18:34,415
...but I'm not gonna, like,
meet your parents...

1204
01:18:34,691 --> 01:18:38,092
...under the pretext of the gay friend.
I mean, that's ridic...

1205
01:18:38,328 --> 01:18:41,695
What? No, I don't mean "meet
your parents" meet your parents.

1206
01:18:41,932 --> 01:18:44,992
I just mean at the wedding,
I'm sure I'll casually bump into them...

1207
01:18:45,235 --> 01:18:47,430
- That's... What?
- I'm sorry, excuse me one second.

1208
01:18:47,671 --> 01:18:49,332
- Dustin, you need to...
- What? What?

1209
01:18:49,573 --> 01:18:52,371
Yeah, what? What is it? What?
Is something wrong?

1210
01:18:52,609 --> 01:18:56,238
- Do you not want me to come?
- You've got it all...

1211
01:18:56,480 --> 01:18:59,972
- You... You don't want me to?
- Wrong.

1212
01:19:00,217 --> 01:19:02,651
Yeah, no. No.

1213
01:19:02,886 --> 01:19:05,218
- Totally. You know what? Sorry.
- Dustin, I have to...

1214
01:19:05,489 --> 01:19:08,083
- That was presumptuous.
- Promise me you won't be upset...

1215
01:19:08,358 --> 01:19:10,622
...if I tell you something.
- Yeah, what?

1216
01:19:11,161 --> 01:19:13,061
I'm seeing somebody.

1217
01:19:13,296 --> 01:19:17,630
And so I asked him
to come with me to the wedding.

1218
01:19:20,136 --> 01:19:21,728
- You're... You're upset.
- No. What?

1219
01:19:22,706 --> 01:19:24,936
Upset? No. Why would I be upset?

1220
01:19:25,275 --> 01:19:27,300
Come on. That's crazy.

1221
01:19:27,544 --> 01:19:30,945
Like I'm a guy that gets upset.
Come on. More like happy.

1222
01:19:31,181 --> 01:19:33,479
You know? I'm happy that...
That, you know.

1223
01:19:33,717 --> 01:19:36,880
- That you found someone special.
- It still feels a little short.

1224
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:38,815
I still think that if you put the...

1225
01:19:39,089 --> 01:19:40,818
- So, dish.
- I just wanna make sure my...

1226
01:19:41,091 --> 01:19:42,752
Who is he?

1227
01:19:43,026 --> 01:19:46,928
Yeah, I think that's too much shoe.

1228
01:19:48,398 --> 01:19:51,834
Man-ischewitz, Sherman,
look at you.

1229
01:19:52,068 --> 01:19:54,298
You remind me of me
on my wedding day.

1230
01:19:54,538 --> 01:19:57,769
I was one nasty son of a bitch.

1231
01:19:59,075 --> 01:20:02,044
- Dad, why did Mom marry you?
- Who makes this tux? Versace?

1232
01:20:02,279 --> 01:20:04,839
- Pop, come on. Fess up. Dad.
- Where'd you get this tux?

1233
01:20:05,081 --> 01:20:07,948
- The black on black.
- Come on, Dad, really.

1234
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:12,117
Your mother was
an incredible woman...

1235
01:20:12,389 --> 01:20:16,120
...but she had awful judgment.

1236
01:20:16,359 --> 01:20:18,793
She was always trying to
find the better man inside me.

1237
01:20:19,062 --> 01:20:23,226
Unfortunately, she found him
inside of her psychotherapist, Janine.

1238
01:20:23,733 --> 01:20:24,700
Not good.

1239
01:20:24,935 --> 01:20:28,769
See, I always knew that your mom was
the best it was ever gonna get for me.

1240
01:20:29,005 --> 01:20:31,997
And I never asked the more
important question, which is:

1241
01:20:32,242 --> 01:20:34,335
Was I the best it was
ever gonna get for her?

1242
01:20:38,949 --> 01:20:40,541
You're not so bad, Pop.

1243
01:20:44,154 --> 01:20:47,123
I'm a fraud, Sherman. Yeah.

1244
01:20:47,357 --> 01:20:49,621
And I'm a selfish asshole.

1245
01:20:56,199 --> 01:20:58,099
And so are you.

1246
01:20:59,069 --> 01:21:01,299
So I want you to get out there...

1247
01:21:02,772 --> 01:21:05,070
...and I want you to revel in it.

1248
01:21:26,262 --> 01:21:28,127
- Oh, my God.
- Hi.

1249
01:21:28,365 --> 01:21:30,356
- You are hot as a pistol.
- You look handsome.

1250
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:33,501
- No, you. I am very...
- I am so impressed with you.

1251
01:21:33,737 --> 01:21:35,932
...impressed. You look beautiful.

1252
01:21:36,539 --> 01:21:39,406
- Do you like the red lipstick?
- I wanna do you right here.

1253
01:21:39,643 --> 01:21:41,668
Okay, I gotta go... Josh.

1254
01:21:41,911 --> 01:21:45,403
My future brother-in-law. Josh,
I want you to meet my boyfriend, Tank.

1255
01:21:45,649 --> 01:21:47,378
Hey, Josh. I'll be your groom...

1256
01:21:47,617 --> 01:21:50,211
<i>...in today's performance of
Fuck Me, I'm Getting Married.</i>

1257
01:21:50,453 --> 01:21:53,320
Okay, well, I'm gonna go
tame Bridezilla.

1258
01:21:53,590 --> 01:21:56,718
- You want me to come? Lex?
- No, I'll look out for him. All right?

1259
01:21:56,993 --> 01:21:59,461
- Just breathe for a second, all right?
- I am breathing.

1260
01:21:59,729 --> 01:22:00,889
Now adapt.

1261
01:22:01,131 --> 01:22:02,462
- Are we adapting?
- Yeah.

1262
01:22:02,699 --> 01:22:04,428
Are we ready to evolve?

1263
01:22:04,668 --> 01:22:07,330
You let fly one word
about our arrangement...

1264
01:22:07,570 --> 01:22:09,595
...I will crush your nuts into butter.

1265
01:22:09,839 --> 01:22:12,706
Like the kind at the health-food store,
but not so good for you.

1266
01:22:12,942 --> 01:22:15,137
But... But, but...

1267
01:22:15,612 --> 01:22:19,013
...you play ball, I will plant your flag
right next to mine. All right?

1268
01:22:19,249 --> 01:22:21,877
I will make you family.
And believe me, Tank...

1269
01:22:22,118 --> 01:22:24,416
...you wanna be family.

1270
01:22:25,555 --> 01:22:27,420
- Money.
- Jesus Christ.

1271
01:22:27,657 --> 01:22:29,921
Like, "money" money.

1272
01:22:30,160 --> 01:22:32,594
Old money, new money,
fuck-me money, fuck-you money.

1273
01:22:32,829 --> 01:22:34,160
Family money, money.

1274
01:22:34,397 --> 01:22:37,457
Okay, yeah.
Josh, you got me all wrong.

1275
01:22:37,701 --> 01:22:40,864
No. I know exactly
who you are, all right?

1276
01:22:41,104 --> 01:22:43,868
It's Alexis who's got you all wrong.

1277
01:22:44,107 --> 01:22:46,667
Let's do what we do, brother.
Hey, Merrilee.

1278
01:22:47,410 --> 01:22:49,674
- Brian.
- Now, I've told you, fella...

1279
01:22:49,913 --> 01:22:52,040
...from here on out,
it's strictly Mom and Dad.

1280
01:22:52,282 --> 01:22:55,115
I'd like to introduce you to
your next son-in-law, Tank Turner.

1281
01:22:55,351 --> 01:22:56,978
This is Alexis' guy.

1282
01:22:57,220 --> 01:23:00,417
- I've heard so much about you.
- That is unfortunate.

1283
01:23:00,690 --> 01:23:02,385
Forget it all.

1284
01:23:02,659 --> 01:23:04,251
- Tank.
- Hi.

1285
01:23:07,630 --> 01:23:11,088
Tank Turner is an asshole.

1286
01:23:11,701 --> 01:23:14,670
- You brought Satan to my wedding?
- Well, he's changed.

1287
01:23:14,904 --> 01:23:16,963
Or he's going to change.
Or he's changing.

1288
01:23:17,207 --> 01:23:18,333
No.

1289
01:23:18,575 --> 01:23:21,066
I'm sorry, but that is not enough.

1290
01:23:21,311 --> 01:23:24,007
Okay, maybe he's this fun vacation
on the dark side...

1291
01:23:24,247 --> 01:23:26,738
Rachel, Rachel, Rachel,
I'm falling in love with him.

1292
01:23:27,250 --> 01:23:28,581
What?

1293
01:23:29,719 --> 01:23:31,277
I love him.

1294
01:23:41,131 --> 01:23:43,497
- Hey, so...
- So many things that I want...

1295
01:23:43,733 --> 01:23:45,462
Oh, come here.

1296
01:23:50,907 --> 01:23:55,241
- I gotta go. I'm going. I'm leaving.
- Go.

1297
01:24:15,932 --> 01:24:18,696
Are you the best
it's ever gonna get for her?

1298
01:24:29,879 --> 01:24:31,369
Are you?

1299
01:25:46,456 --> 01:25:49,857
If anyone here can show just cause
why these two should not be joined...

1300
01:25:50,126 --> 01:25:55,154
...let them speak now
or forever hold their peace.

1301
01:25:55,465 --> 01:25:57,194
White dress.

1302
01:25:57,967 --> 01:26:00,231
Chick's seen more dick than this guy.

1303
01:26:01,537 --> 01:26:03,198
Ridonculous.

1304
01:26:08,478 --> 01:26:12,972
I've been wanting to come over here
because I was reminded of a joke.

1305
01:26:13,683 --> 01:26:16,914
A priest and a Rabbi are at a wedding.
Who knew?

1306
01:26:17,487 --> 01:26:21,446
And they see a small boy
bending over to tie his shoe.

1307
01:26:21,724 --> 01:26:23,851
So the priest says to the Rabbi:

1308
01:26:24,127 --> 01:26:26,186
"God, I'd really love to screw that kid."

1309
01:26:26,462 --> 01:26:30,023
And then the Rabbi says,
"Out of what?"

1310
01:26:32,001 --> 01:26:34,868
It's a visual thing,
because the kid is basically like this.

1311
01:26:35,104 --> 01:26:36,230
He's bending over.

1312
01:26:38,508 --> 01:26:40,203
Dirty Houdini. You gotta try this.

1313
01:26:40,443 --> 01:26:44,004
While you're giving it
to your lady from behind, okay?

1314
01:26:44,247 --> 01:26:46,010
Very important.
You gotta be behind her.

1315
01:26:46,249 --> 01:26:48,513
Start making some sounds
like you're gonna bust...

1316
01:26:48,751 --> 01:26:49,877
...then you pull out.

1317
01:26:50,119 --> 01:26:53,316
As you pull out, you let a little dribble
of saliva trickle down...

1318
01:26:53,589 --> 01:26:56,615
...onto the small of her back.
She thinks it's over, she flips over:

1319
01:26:56,893 --> 01:26:58,224
"Good, I can go to sleep."

1320
01:26:58,461 --> 01:27:00,691
Fireman's hose. All over.

1321
01:27:05,301 --> 01:27:07,201
- I don't get it.
- You don't get it?

1322
01:27:07,437 --> 01:27:10,463
Here's what you're gonna do.
Go ask your mom. Right there. Pound.

1323
01:27:16,946 --> 01:27:18,106
Ready, and wow.

1324
01:27:19,549 --> 01:27:21,483
It's like lifting a coffin.

1325
01:27:22,919 --> 01:27:25,513
Oh, Nana. You have a lead vagina.

1326
01:27:30,326 --> 01:27:32,157
Hello? Yeah, I can talk.

1327
01:27:37,633 --> 01:27:39,760
- You weren't gonna drink.
- Can't have a glass...

1328
01:27:40,003 --> 01:27:41,561
...to celebrate the holy sacrament?

1329
01:27:41,804 --> 01:27:43,897
- Is that Jägermeister I smell?
- I don't know.

1330
01:27:44,140 --> 01:27:45,903
Wine, huh?

1331
01:27:47,844 --> 01:27:49,402
- No.
- Don't get into any trouble.

1332
01:27:49,645 --> 01:27:52,273
- I'm don't-ing. I'm don't-ing.
- Don't get into any trouble.

1333
01:28:01,124 --> 01:28:03,388
For their first dance
as a married couple...

1334
01:28:03,626 --> 01:28:08,120
...l'd like to present to you
Rachel and Josh.

1335
01:28:20,576 --> 01:28:21,634
Sorry.

1336
01:28:22,578 --> 01:28:24,409
Can I have this dance?

1337
01:28:24,647 --> 01:28:25,875
Not a good time? Okay.

1338
01:28:26,115 --> 01:28:30,575
Sorry, everybody. This is their night.
I'll clean that up. It's the chicken.

1339
01:28:31,621 --> 01:28:33,486
The bride and groom.

1340
01:28:39,762 --> 01:28:42,663
I'm gonna grab these. Clean.
I washed them after I threw up.

1341
01:28:42,899 --> 01:28:45,629
How are you? There's
a lot of talent here tonight, okay?

1342
01:28:45,868 --> 01:28:49,599
Lookit, lookit that one right over there.
Check out the lungs on that one.

1343
01:28:50,039 --> 01:28:52,530
That's Rachel's cousin. She's 15.

1344
01:28:52,775 --> 01:28:54,868
She's gonna be a scuba diver
when she grows up.

1345
01:28:55,111 --> 01:28:57,102
Not that you don't have
some stuff going on.

1346
01:28:57,346 --> 01:28:59,780
I'd part you like the Red Sea
and let you call me Moses.

1347
01:29:00,016 --> 01:29:02,484
I would open you up like
a public pool on Memorial Day.

1348
01:29:02,718 --> 01:29:04,583
Three words:

1349
01:29:04,854 --> 01:29:06,321
Let's eat.

1350
01:29:07,023 --> 01:29:08,923
It's okay, I got the sleeve. I caught it.

1351
01:29:09,158 --> 01:29:11,626
Usually they come in twos
and threes, so that's...

1352
01:29:14,330 --> 01:29:16,798
Cocaine, you know,
just kind of gets me sneezy.

1353
01:29:17,033 --> 01:29:20,059
And you, by the way, look lovely.
I just wanted to...

1354
01:29:20,303 --> 01:29:22,897
...say a hello to you.

1355
01:29:27,276 --> 01:29:28,766
All right.

1356
01:29:33,549 --> 01:29:35,983
Weddings get me hot and hard,
know what I'm saying?

1357
01:29:36,219 --> 01:29:37,846
What do you got going on?

1358
01:29:38,087 --> 01:29:40,555
I want that in my fucking mouth.

1359
01:29:43,993 --> 01:29:45,790
When's the last time
you shit your pants?

1360
01:29:46,028 --> 01:29:48,758
- Today. Today.
- You shit your pants today?

1361
01:29:48,998 --> 01:29:52,058
- I shit my pants yesterday.
- Today!

1362
01:29:52,301 --> 01:29:55,099
- Me, today.
- Just a little. But not a whole shit.

1363
01:29:55,338 --> 01:29:59,138
Hey. Hey, Alexis sent me
to look for you, so let's go.

1364
01:29:59,542 --> 01:30:02,033
Let me just take a snapshot
of you in my mind right now.

1365
01:30:02,278 --> 01:30:04,974
Gross. Fuck, I can
smell you from here, dude.

1366
01:30:05,214 --> 01:30:08,581
- How drunk are you right now?
- I had massive amounts of alcohol.

1367
01:30:08,818 --> 01:30:11,412
I'm embarrassed.
But I'm sobering up now...

1368
01:30:11,654 --> 01:30:13,588
...and I feel better.
Having a little chat.

1369
01:30:13,823 --> 01:30:17,224
With my friend.
Taking a breather. Breathing.

1370
01:30:19,195 --> 01:30:21,891
Fucking goddamn it.
What do you call that shit, A. J?

1371
01:30:22,131 --> 01:30:24,656
Afghani-Kush Kryptonite.

1372
01:30:24,901 --> 01:30:28,234
Kryptonite. It killed Superman.
I'm just a man.

1373
01:30:28,471 --> 01:30:31,702
You really are, like, a super
special kind of asshole, aren't you?

1374
01:30:31,941 --> 01:30:33,841
I ride the special-kind-of-asshole bus.

1375
01:30:34,076 --> 01:30:36,169
- Do you really?
- All right. Okay.

1376
01:30:36,979 --> 01:30:39,038
- One more bite.
- What are you doing?

1377
01:30:39,282 --> 01:30:41,773
Alexis is gonna freak out
when she sees this.

1378
01:30:42,018 --> 01:30:43,144
- No she won't.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1379
01:30:43,386 --> 01:30:45,149
- She's understanding.
- Oh, my God, dude.

1380
01:30:45,421 --> 01:30:48,390
- She's never gonna forgive you.
- All right. I'm coming. I'm coming.

1381
01:30:50,459 --> 01:30:51,892
- What a day.
- Yeah.

1382
01:30:53,362 --> 01:30:55,728
May I partake?

1383
01:30:56,332 --> 01:30:59,324
My daughter got married today.

1384
01:30:59,569 --> 01:31:03,027
- Wonderful.
- Oh, God, I feel old.

1385
01:31:03,272 --> 01:31:08,710
I bet back in the day, you were
one hot slice of fuckberry pie.

1386
01:31:12,048 --> 01:31:15,711
You bet your sweet ass I was.

1387
01:31:17,320 --> 01:31:20,448
Hey. I love your shoes.

1388
01:31:21,324 --> 01:31:23,292
So are we gonna do this or what?

1389
01:31:25,595 --> 01:31:26,789
Come on, it's not gonna
suck itself, Mama.

1390
01:31:27,897 --> 01:31:29,922
Oh, my God.

1391
01:31:30,166 --> 01:31:32,327
Who is this guy?

1392
01:31:34,136 --> 01:31:36,536
And he's ruining my entire wedding.

1393
01:31:36,772 --> 01:31:39,866
He ruined my dance,
my actual dance.

1394
01:31:40,109 --> 01:31:43,374
No, it's ruined.
And... Why did you bring him here?

1395
01:31:43,613 --> 01:31:45,376
It's disgusting.

1396
01:31:47,283 --> 01:31:50,741
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1397
01:31:50,987 --> 01:31:53,854
- Are you kidding me?
- He really?

1398
01:31:56,626 --> 01:31:59,390
I got a bass-ackward way of
showing it, but I care about you.

1399
01:31:59,629 --> 01:32:02,359
Tank. Tank! How could you?!

1400
01:32:02,965 --> 01:32:05,627
My ex, Sarah. Cunt.

1401
01:32:07,270 --> 01:32:09,397
Oh, no. You're not gonna
walk away from me.

1402
01:32:09,639 --> 01:32:11,436
You're gonna talk to me.
This is insane.

1403
01:32:11,674 --> 01:32:13,733
Who is that person, huh?
Who is that guy?

1404
01:32:13,976 --> 01:32:16,501
This is me. I'm an asshole.

1405
01:32:16,746 --> 01:32:19,408
You had your chance with a good guy
and you threw it away.

1406
01:32:19,649 --> 01:32:20,911
- Who?
- Dustin.

1407
01:32:21,150 --> 01:32:24,176
- You have no right to tell me...
- No, Dustin. Dustin's here.

1408
01:32:24,420 --> 01:32:26,388
Dustin. Dustin?

1409
01:32:26,656 --> 01:32:27,748
- Dustin?
- Be careful.

1410
01:32:28,024 --> 01:32:29,787
Tank!

1411
01:32:40,002 --> 01:32:41,560
It's time you all knew the truth.

1412
01:32:41,804 --> 01:32:44,705
Would you stop? If I go down,
you're coming with me, okay?

1413
01:32:44,940 --> 01:32:49,070
Okay? So I'm sure every...

1414
01:32:49,979 --> 01:32:50,946
Don't touch.

1415
01:32:52,348 --> 01:32:55,283
I would like to share something
with you about Mr. Tank Turner.

1416
01:32:55,518 --> 01:32:58,282
Surely by now he's charmed his way
into your hearts... Stop.

1417
01:32:58,554 --> 01:33:01,523
Charmed his way into your hearts
but I've got something to tell you.

1418
01:33:01,791 --> 01:33:03,588
Tank Turner is a fraud.

1419
01:33:03,826 --> 01:33:05,623
Okay? Why don't you
take a walk with me?

1420
01:33:05,861 --> 01:33:08,728
- Hey! Come with me, okay?
- Dustin.

1421
01:33:08,964 --> 01:33:11,489
Would you guys like to know
what this man...? Excuse me.

1422
01:33:11,734 --> 01:33:14,032
- What this man does as a hobby?
- Stop.

1423
01:33:14,270 --> 01:33:17,137
- You stop! You stop! Okay?
- Please.

1424
01:33:17,373 --> 01:33:18,340
- Hold on.
- I'm sorry.

1425
01:33:18,574 --> 01:33:22,135
Let's say, for example...

1426
01:33:22,378 --> 01:33:25,745
...I get dumped by my girl.

1427
01:33:25,981 --> 01:33:30,315
And I want to pay him
to go out with her...

1428
01:33:30,553 --> 01:33:32,817
- Oh, boy.
...terrorize her...

1429
01:33:33,089 --> 01:33:37,025
...and have her come screaming back
into my arms.

1430
01:33:37,293 --> 01:33:39,591
So your Mr. Perfect...

1431
01:33:39,829 --> 01:33:41,057
Your Mr. Perfect...

1432
01:33:41,297 --> 01:33:47,395
...is actually Mr. Asshole-
Dickhead-Shitface-Guy, okay?

1433
01:33:48,471 --> 01:33:52,532
Alexis, l... l...
I loved you so much.

1434
01:33:52,775 --> 01:33:57,405
I did. And I just,
I couldn't bear to lose you...

1435
01:33:57,646 --> 01:34:02,208
...and so I made a deal
with the devil.

1436
01:34:02,451 --> 01:34:06,251
That's what I did. Which is pathetic.

1437
01:34:06,522 --> 01:34:07,955
- I'm a pathetic fool.
- Yeah, okay.

1438
01:34:08,224 --> 01:34:11,523
- But... But what does that make him?
- Okay, stop. Stop it.

1439
01:34:11,761 --> 01:34:14,457
Just tell me this isn't true.

1440
01:34:17,099 --> 01:34:18,964
Ask him.

1441
01:34:20,069 --> 01:34:21,502
- Baby, sorry.
- You make me sick.

1442
01:34:21,737 --> 01:34:24,831
- Ask him.
- I hate you.

1443
01:34:26,308 --> 01:34:28,003
- Ask him.
- I'm gonna kill you!

1444
01:34:28,244 --> 01:34:30,075
I'm gonna kill you!

1445
01:34:30,312 --> 01:34:32,678
- I work on referrals.
- Okay.

1446
01:34:33,983 --> 01:34:36,543
You're honestly gonna tell me...

1447
01:34:37,686 --> 01:34:41,588
...that you and I, that's nothing?

1448
01:34:42,124 --> 01:34:43,819
That's nothing?

1449
01:34:45,861 --> 01:34:48,125
I'm just a job?

1450
01:34:49,131 --> 01:34:53,295
I need you to tell me.
Tank, tell me right now...

1451
01:34:53,536 --> 01:34:55,527
...that I'm just a job.

1452
01:34:55,771 --> 01:34:59,537
- Tell me to my face.
- You're just a job.

1453
01:35:04,680 --> 01:35:06,545
Just a job.

1454
01:35:06,782 --> 01:35:09,546
I never wanna see you again.

1455
01:35:10,586 --> 01:35:12,144
Yeah.

1456
01:35:12,388 --> 01:35:14,652
Alexis. Alexis.

1457
01:35:14,924 --> 01:35:16,824
I'm gonna kill you!

1458
01:35:46,722 --> 01:35:48,622
Motherfucker.

1459
01:36:09,612 --> 01:36:12,240
<i>You have one new message.</i>

1460
01:36:13,249 --> 01:36:15,183
<i>Dust, you were right.</i>

1461
01:36:15,417 --> 01:36:17,476
<i>Alexis is an angel...</i>

1462
01:36:17,720 --> 01:36:20,553
<i>... and she deserves the best.</i>

1463
01:36:22,191 --> 01:36:24,318
<i>And that's you.
So I'm sorry it took so long...</i>

1464
01:36:24,593 --> 01:36:27,153
<i>... but I finally did
what you hired me to do.</i>

1465
01:36:27,396 --> 01:36:30,126
<i>I got a bass-ackward way of
showing it, but I care about you.</i>

1466
01:36:30,366 --> 01:36:33,335
<i>Tank. Tank! How could you?!</i>

1467
01:36:33,569 --> 01:36:36,094
<i>My ex, Sarah. Cunt.</i>

1468
01:37:09,238 --> 01:37:10,830
Did you love her?

1469
01:37:11,073 --> 01:37:13,564
Do you love her?
That's all I wanna know.

1470
01:37:15,077 --> 01:37:17,238
I don't even know what that means.

1471
01:37:17,479 --> 01:37:20,471
Yeah. Well, apparently, neither do I.

1472
01:37:20,849 --> 01:37:23,477
All I know is that me and her
ends up with her hurt.

1473
01:37:23,719 --> 01:37:25,084
It's inevitable.

1474
01:37:25,321 --> 01:37:27,846
Turners and women, right, Pop?

1475
01:37:28,123 --> 01:37:29,420
Yeah.

1476
01:37:31,594 --> 01:37:33,858
I banged a lot of women, Sherman.

1477
01:37:34,597 --> 01:37:36,497
I've been banging
since back in the day...

1478
01:37:36,732 --> 01:37:39,257
...when you were
laminating pictures of them.

1479
01:37:39,501 --> 01:37:41,594
So, yeah, that's me.

1480
01:37:42,237 --> 01:37:45,206
That's this guy, but that ain't you.
No.

1481
01:37:45,441 --> 01:37:48,842
Last night, you proved something
that I have long feared.

1482
01:37:49,078 --> 01:37:50,636
And that is...

1483
01:37:50,879 --> 01:37:53,040
...you may just
take after your mother.

1484
01:37:54,917 --> 01:37:58,648
Yeah, I can't believe you actually
tried to give Alexis up for me.

1485
01:37:59,254 --> 01:38:00,380
I know, dude.

1486
01:38:00,656 --> 01:38:02,521
- That's pretty fucked up, right?
- Yeah.

1487
01:38:02,758 --> 01:38:04,783
I mean, if that's not love...

1488
01:38:05,628 --> 01:38:07,562
Yeah, I'm sorry, man.

1489
01:38:08,097 --> 01:38:11,157
I'm sorry. I'm the guy who...

1490
01:38:12,768 --> 01:38:14,668
You were my best friend.

1491
01:38:15,337 --> 01:38:16,964
I still am.

1492
01:38:18,774 --> 01:38:20,833
You guys gonna make out now, huh?

1493
01:38:21,076 --> 01:38:23,943
Go ahead, stick your tongue
in his mouth. That'll clear the air.

1494
01:38:26,949 --> 01:38:28,382
How about a?

1495
01:38:35,758 --> 01:38:39,888
Look, I know I kind of lost it for a while,
but now I'm seeing things clearly.

1496
01:38:40,129 --> 01:38:42,063
You need to get her back.

1497
01:38:44,199 --> 01:38:46,190
- But I don't deserve her.
- No, you... Tank.

1498
01:38:46,435 --> 01:38:48,903
If you were willing to give her up,
you deserve her.

1499
01:38:49,271 --> 01:38:51,705
That's fucked up, but you're right.

1500
01:38:54,209 --> 01:38:56,404
She's my angel
and it's time she knew.

1501
01:38:56,645 --> 01:38:58,510
Yes. So, what's stopping you?

1502
01:38:58,681 --> 01:39:00,546
I propositioned her mother
for a blowjob.

1503
01:39:01,984 --> 01:39:04,578
Man, that is great.

1504
01:39:04,820 --> 01:39:07,288
That is so great. Yes.

1505
01:39:08,190 --> 01:39:10,988
Alexis! Alexis, wait.

1506
01:39:11,226 --> 01:39:12,659
Alexis.

1507
01:39:12,895 --> 01:39:14,658
Just hear me out, all right? Listen.

1508
01:39:14,897 --> 01:39:17,627
Nope. Nope. Nope.

1509
01:39:17,866 --> 01:39:19,197
I did it for you.

1510
01:39:19,435 --> 01:39:21,995
I pushed you away because
I thought I didn't deserve you.

1511
01:39:22,237 --> 01:39:25,638
- You don't.
- So I made a mistake.

1512
01:39:25,874 --> 01:39:28,399
- Many.
- I know.

1513
01:39:28,644 --> 01:39:30,805
- I will never do better than you.
- I know.

1514
01:39:31,046 --> 01:39:32,980
- I need you in my life.
- I know.

1515
01:39:33,215 --> 01:39:36,048
- And I wanna apologize.
- I don't want it.

1516
01:39:36,285 --> 01:39:38,719
Good, because it's not for you.

1517
01:39:38,987 --> 01:39:41,683
I wanna apologize to myself.

1518
01:39:41,957 --> 01:39:45,393
I'm sorry, Tank,
that you blew it with Alexis.

1519
01:39:45,661 --> 01:39:47,959
- But you did.
- Because I thought you deserved...

1520
01:39:48,197 --> 01:39:49,562
...someone better than me.

1521
01:39:49,798 --> 01:39:53,495
But when I'm with you,
it's like I'm better than me.

1522
01:39:53,969 --> 01:39:57,700
You're the only person that could ever
make me do cardio. And I hate cardio.

1523
01:39:57,940 --> 01:40:01,398
I wanna faint, I want a cigarette
and I have a massive cramp.

1524
01:40:01,643 --> 01:40:03,907
But I would run a marathon for you.

1525
01:40:09,585 --> 01:40:11,644
- Okay.
- Fuck me.

1526
01:40:11,887 --> 01:40:13,855
You ruined my sister's wedding.

1527
01:40:14,123 --> 01:40:17,286
But I saved her life.
That guy was a fucking fuckface.

1528
01:40:17,559 --> 01:40:21,552
- You curse incessantly.
- I will never swear again.

1529
01:40:21,830 --> 01:40:23,263
Fuck. Last one.

1530
01:40:23,532 --> 01:40:26,865
- My parents hate you.
- Well, they'll come around.

1531
01:40:27,102 --> 01:40:28,364
Except your mother.

1532
01:40:28,604 --> 01:40:29,593
And your dad.

1533
01:40:29,838 --> 01:40:32,671
- Your job is a joke.
- A joke? I sell air.

1534
01:40:32,908 --> 01:40:34,273
I do the impossible every day.

1535
01:40:34,510 --> 01:40:36,205
Have you ever even read a book?

1536
01:40:36,445 --> 01:40:38,106
<i>The Giving Tree.</i>

1537
01:40:38,547 --> 01:40:41,107
- And?
- Among others. Countless others.

1538
01:40:41,350 --> 01:40:44,148
- Tank.
- I'll join a book club.

1539
01:40:44,887 --> 01:40:47,583
What's the matter?
You can't keep up?

1540
01:40:48,657 --> 01:40:51,820
You are not passionate
about anything.

1541
01:40:52,060 --> 01:40:55,427
Except you. I'm passionate about you.
As evidence, consider the fact...

1542
01:40:55,664 --> 01:40:57,791
...that I've been running
for two goddamn hours.

1543
01:40:58,033 --> 01:41:00,228
- I need to stop and rest.
- You sabotage dates.

1544
01:41:00,469 --> 01:41:02,733
You're a professional asshole.
That's what you do.

1545
01:41:02,971 --> 01:41:06,168
No. It's what I did.

1546
01:41:06,942 --> 01:41:10,070
Tank, I just don't think
you're the one.

1547
01:41:13,182 --> 01:41:16,208
Not yet, but I'll get there.

1548
01:41:28,330 --> 01:41:29,627
You okay?

1549
01:42:42,838 --> 01:42:45,739
Without air, we cannot live.

1550
01:42:47,276 --> 01:42:49,267
I think those words resonate
with people...

1551
01:42:49,511 --> 01:42:53,208
...because they're really true,
you know?

1552
01:42:58,587 --> 01:42:59,918
What?

1553
01:43:00,956 --> 01:43:02,981
I thought... I thought that was a joke.

1554
01:43:03,525 --> 01:43:07,689
- It wasn't. What are you talking about?
- Nothing.

1555
01:43:07,930 --> 01:43:09,261
Air?

1556
01:43:09,498 --> 01:43:12,467
Because I don't really think
there's anything funny about air.

1557
01:43:12,701 --> 01:43:14,601
It's kind of too important.

1558
01:43:25,080 --> 01:43:26,638
Asshole.

1559
01:43:29,985 --> 01:43:30,952
- Hi.
- Hi.

1560
01:43:31,186 --> 01:43:32,153
- I'm Alexis.
- Hi.

1561
01:43:32,421 --> 01:43:34,855
Do you wanna know what
this guy did? He humiliated me.

1562
01:43:35,090 --> 01:43:37,081
- He embarrassed me. He literally...
- Alexis.

1563
01:43:37,359 --> 01:43:38,451
I'm having a conversation.

1564
01:43:38,727 --> 01:43:42,026
I'm having a conversation.
It's with her, it's not with you.

1565
01:43:43,031 --> 01:43:45,158
What this guy did to me
makes me sick every day.

1566
01:43:45,400 --> 01:43:46,992
Physically ill.

1567
01:43:47,235 --> 01:43:49,635
But is that like lovesickness
or like hatesickness?

1568
01:43:49,871 --> 01:43:52,066
- No, it's like morning sickness.
- What?

1569
01:43:53,475 --> 01:43:56,740
Yeah, I'm pregnant, okay?
So I'm sorry.

1570
01:43:57,512 --> 01:43:59,639
It makes me a little emotional.

1571
01:43:59,881 --> 01:44:03,112
- You're pregnant?
- Yes, I'm fucking pregnant!

1572
01:44:03,352 --> 01:44:05,081
I probably should go.

1573
01:44:05,320 --> 01:44:06,787
But how? It's...

1574
01:44:08,090 --> 01:44:09,921
How do you think?

1575
01:44:10,158 --> 01:44:11,489
That's right, everybody.

1576
01:44:11,727 --> 01:44:15,823
This asshole got me pregnant.

1577
01:44:16,465 --> 01:44:19,992
- I definitely think I should go.
- Okay, I didn't know. I didn't know.

1578
01:44:20,235 --> 01:44:21,532
If you think that's bad...

1579
01:44:21,770 --> 01:44:23,965
...you should hear what this guy
did to my sister.

1580
01:44:24,206 --> 01:44:28,643
- Alexis, I've apologized a million times.
- He got her pregnant too.

1581
01:44:29,378 --> 01:44:32,006
So there's two of us
having a baby together...

1582
01:44:32,247 --> 01:44:35,580
...about three and a half weeks
apart.

1583
01:44:35,817 --> 01:44:37,341
- Yeah.
- It was dark, I was drunk...

1584
01:44:37,586 --> 01:44:39,019
...and I thought it was you.

1585
01:44:39,254 --> 01:44:40,721
Right?

1586
01:44:44,760 --> 01:44:47,695
I'm gonna go now.
It was nice meeting you.

1587
01:44:47,929 --> 01:44:50,159
Yeah, nice to meet you too.

1588
01:44:51,700 --> 01:44:52,826
What's going on here?

1589
01:44:53,935 --> 01:44:56,130
Oh, I'm just saving another girl...

1590
01:44:56,371 --> 01:44:59,067
...from the worst sex
she'll ever have in her life.

1591
01:45:03,812 --> 01:45:06,178
Well, your mother never complained.

1592
01:45:08,150 --> 01:45:11,415
You wanna know why
I didn't return your e-mails?

1593
01:45:12,120 --> 01:45:13,610
Your pathetic calls?

1594
01:45:14,956 --> 01:45:18,289
You are unattractive. I said it.

1595
01:45:20,195 --> 01:45:22,322
I'm not attractive.
Well, let's put it this way.

1596
01:45:22,564 --> 01:45:25,727
I would kick your ass right now,
but my foot might get sucked in.

1597
01:45:27,736 --> 01:45:32,036
I'd kick your dick right now,
but my foot might get herpes.

1598
01:45:32,841 --> 01:45:35,537
Well, you know, you can
stop trying to be clever, Alexis.

1599
01:45:35,777 --> 01:45:39,304
The funniest thing that'll ever
come out of you is me.

1600
01:45:39,781 --> 01:45:41,840
All right, Tank.

1601
01:45:42,084 --> 01:45:44,416
You got the best joke here.

1602
01:45:45,520 --> 01:45:47,181
And it's in your pants.

1603
01:45:58,100 --> 01:46:00,034
- I hate you.
- I hate you too.

1604
01:46:00,268 --> 01:46:01,997
Oh, baby.
