1
00:01:04,399 --> 00:01:08,403
<i>Every year, it's weird going back to school.
Seeing each other face-to-face again,</i>

2
00:01:08,486 --> 00:01:11,573
<i>but at least I have my best friends,
Janice and Emily.</i>

3
00:01:13,449 --> 00:01:16,494
<i>We're in slo-mo, 'cause that's how
all the hot girls always show up.</i>

4
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:18,371
<i>Just kidding.</i>

5
00:01:19,038 --> 00:01:23,501
<i>We just wanna look like we don't care.
Especially in front of the guys.</i>

6
00:01:27,005 --> 00:01:30,174
<i>And this is me not caring.</i>

7
00:01:33,553 --> 00:01:38,141
<i>And that's Janice and Lloyd,
pretending to be very complicated.</i>

8
00:01:39,726 --> 00:01:42,979
<i>And Wen, well,
nobody seems to care about him.</i>

9
00:01:43,021 --> 00:01:44,022
Hello, what's happening?

10
00:01:45,189 --> 00:01:49,986
<i>But when it comes to friendship, and I mean
real friendship, like with me and Kyle,</i>

11
00:01:50,528 --> 00:01:52,864
<i>you can officially care
and just be yourself.</i>

12
00:01:53,615 --> 00:01:54,907
<i>Oh, and her...</i>

13
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:58,494
<i>We call her the Post-it,
'cause she sticks to every guy</i>

14
00:01:58,536 --> 00:02:01,706
<i>and pretends that she loves them. Whatever.</i>

15
00:02:02,749 --> 00:02:05,543
<i>All I know is I'm sick
of all the pretending.</i>

16
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,879
<i>The truth is I just wanna
have a great year.</i>

17
00:02:10,173 --> 00:02:13,301
<i>Just like last year
when I fell in love with Chad.</i>

18
00:02:15,553 --> 00:02:18,681
"Forever."

19
00:02:24,729 --> 00:02:28,316
<i>Speaking of forever, that's how long
Kyle and I have been friends.</i>

20
00:02:33,738 --> 00:02:34,781
I'm here.

21
00:02:37,033 --> 00:02:38,660
<i>I hope it always stays that way.</i>

22
00:02:42,372 --> 00:02:45,041
<i>Anyway, here we are
just going with the flow.</i>

23
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:48,336
<i>Trying to love, live and laugh out loud.</i>

24
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:52,340
<i>Which is nice, 'cause my name is Lola,
but everyone calls me Lol.</i>

25
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:04,560
Dude, I cannot believe
she hijacked my Zadig bag!

26
00:03:04,769 --> 00:03:06,479
I had to special order this thing.

27
00:03:07,563 --> 00:03:09,482
Oh, my God, your new song is amazing.

28
00:03:09,565 --> 00:03:10,566
You liked it?

29
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:12,235
That guitar solo is hot!

30
00:03:13,486 --> 00:03:15,655
Ladies, ladies, welcome back.

31
00:03:16,447 --> 00:03:18,616
Okay, Wen, don't even try, okay.

32
00:03:18,658 --> 00:03:20,201
- You know you want me.
- Yeah.

33
00:03:20,284 --> 00:03:22,120
Okay, I want you to leave me alone now.

34
00:03:22,578 --> 00:03:24,664
- I like it. Alone. Tonight?
- Yeah. Yes.

35
00:03:24,789 --> 00:03:26,582
Good, I'll see you tonight, alone.

36
00:03:28,543 --> 00:03:32,130
Oh, my God, he is so gorgeous it hurts.

37
00:03:35,007 --> 00:03:37,427
I can't believe you're taking trig class
just for him.

38
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:46,010
- So you missed me?
- Yeah.

39
00:03:46,561 --> 00:03:48,479
It was brutal.

40
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,106
You didn't call or text me.

41
00:03:50,314 --> 00:03:53,818
I did. You just didn't get it
because there was no reception.

42
00:03:55,153 --> 00:03:59,657
Plus, I kind of hooked up with this girl,
another counselor.

43
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:05,663
Yeah, no problem. I just...

44
00:04:05,747 --> 00:04:07,165
It was just a onetime thing.

45
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:09,834
No, it's cool, I'm happy you said that.

46
00:04:09,876 --> 00:04:13,880
'Cause I hooked up with somebody, too.
Just to try it.

47
00:04:15,006 --> 00:04:19,510
I really hope you kept his number. I mean,
I'd hate for you to end up all alone.

48
00:04:20,011 --> 00:04:21,012
Got it on speed dial.

49
00:04:26,142 --> 00:04:28,186
Hey, Lola, you okay?

50
00:04:28,978 --> 00:04:29,979
Lola!

51
00:04:30,271 --> 00:04:31,647
Hey, Lola, you okay?

52
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,145
Hey, so what happened with volleyball?

53
00:05:11,229 --> 00:05:12,396
I got a stomachache.

54
00:05:12,563 --> 00:05:14,398
So, you'll be the dolphin. What's his name?

55
00:05:17,735 --> 00:05:18,986
Lola, is that a Brazilian?

56
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,321
Mom!

57
00:05:21,447 --> 00:05:22,448
Mom, what?

58
00:05:23,574 --> 00:05:27,370
Nothing, it's just... It's my body
and I'll take care of it how I want to.

59
00:05:27,578 --> 00:05:31,165
No, it's not. And I'm not going
to let you be a porn star.

60
00:05:31,582 --> 00:05:32,583
What's a porn star?

61
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:33,626
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

62
00:05:35,795 --> 00:05:40,383
You haven't done anything with boys.
I mean, you would tell me, right?

63
00:05:40,466 --> 00:05:42,051
Yes, Mom. I would tell you.

64
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:45,930
I just want to take a nice, relaxing shower
and hang outwith my family.

65
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:49,267
And then, here you go, putting me on trial
for my grooming choices.

66
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:50,351
I'm not a baby any more.

67
00:05:50,685 --> 00:05:53,271
Hey, and come back
and pick up these clothes.

68
00:05:53,521 --> 00:05:54,689
I'm not your maid.

69
00:05:55,648 --> 00:05:59,151
<i>"Aren't mothers supposed to have
some kind of protective instinct?"</i>

70
00:05:59,485 --> 00:06:03,990
<i>"She has no idea what it's like out there
This was so not a perfect day."</i>

71
00:06:24,635 --> 00:06:25,720
My baby!

72
00:06:27,471 --> 00:06:30,433
- I love you, Mom.
- I love you, too.

73
00:06:44,655 --> 00:06:47,992
Mom, hurry.
Mom, come on, you're making me late.

74
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:50,077
Then wake up earlier.
I'm not your chauffeur.

75
00:06:50,161 --> 00:06:51,621
I haven't even had my coffee yet.

76
00:06:52,663 --> 00:06:56,500
Lola, is that my sweater?
Quit stealing my things.

77
00:06:56,584 --> 00:06:58,169
Oh, yeah, Mom, you want me to freeze?

78
00:06:58,210 --> 00:06:59,587
Depends, will it make you nicer?

79
00:07:04,133 --> 00:07:07,845
So here I am, driving you to school,
thinking, "This will be great."

80
00:07:07,887 --> 00:07:12,016
"We can have some good conversation.
We can connect with one another."

81
00:07:12,183 --> 00:07:14,644
But here you are in your bubble
and I'm not in that bubble.

82
00:07:14,685 --> 00:07:17,021
And I'm right here. I'm right here.

83
00:07:25,988 --> 00:07:28,741
- Hey, hey, hey!
- What? Here. Here.

84
00:07:34,163 --> 00:07:35,206
Go.

85
00:08:13,703 --> 00:08:15,788
And your reason for being late is?

86
00:08:17,206 --> 00:08:18,582
Well, you're going to laugh.

87
00:08:18,749 --> 00:08:20,501
This is as much as I laugh.

88
00:08:23,504 --> 00:08:25,881
- Did you see her face?
- Yeah, she totally wants me.

89
00:08:25,923 --> 00:08:26,924
Shut up!

90
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:29,510
So, did you make up with Chad?

91
00:08:30,011 --> 00:08:31,012
No.

92
00:08:31,929 --> 00:08:35,141
Well, I just want you to know that
if I were him, I'd never let you go.

93
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:36,851
Yeah, but you're not him.

94
00:08:37,101 --> 00:08:39,937
I know we're friends,
but I don't always agree with him.

95
00:08:40,312 --> 00:08:41,313
I know.

96
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,817
And I kind of want us to stay friends.

97
00:08:46,235 --> 00:08:47,236
Me too.

98
00:08:48,487 --> 00:08:49,488
Cool.

99
00:08:50,156 --> 00:08:51,157
Cool.

100
00:08:55,536 --> 00:09:00,624
X-squared equals 9X plus 4B.
B equals 9, C equals 14.

101
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:01,709
Any questions?

102
00:09:01,876 --> 00:09:05,129
All right, pay attention. Let's keep
it moving, people. Next equation.

103
00:09:08,632 --> 00:09:09,800
Emily, can you solve this?

104
00:09:15,473 --> 00:09:17,099
Do you need some help solving this?

105
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,811
Okay, well, it's not that complicated.

106
00:09:21,145 --> 00:09:26,025
First, to find the range for F,
we must solve for the inverse of...

107
00:09:26,942 --> 00:09:29,153
F to the negative first power.

108
00:09:30,404 --> 00:09:33,866
X equals X plus one over...

109
00:10:02,394 --> 00:10:07,066
X plus one over X minus two.

110
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:08,359
Yeah, you got that?

111
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:10,861
- Yeah.
- Okay. Everybody got that?

112
00:10:17,076 --> 00:10:18,077
Sorry I'm late.

113
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,497
Yeah, yeah, come in.

114
00:10:27,002 --> 00:10:28,712
Man, the girls are in heat.

115
00:10:29,421 --> 00:10:30,422
Yeah, you would know.

116
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,841
What?

117
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:35,719
What's your problem?

118
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:48,107
That's not funny. Do you want to
go to the principal's office?

119
00:10:49,191 --> 00:10:50,442
What? It's a French baguette.

120
00:10:52,111 --> 00:10:53,237
Sorry I'm late.

121
00:10:54,405 --> 00:10:57,032
- Sorry.
- Hey, enough with the feet. Quiet, please.

122
00:10:57,408 --> 00:10:59,660
And you, put it away.
We do not eat in class.

123
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:07,543
The first one who uses his...

124
00:11:08,586 --> 00:11:16,586
Keep it up,
I'll cancel the spring break trip to Paris.

125
00:11:28,939 --> 00:11:30,107
Tutoring for what?

126
00:11:31,233 --> 00:11:32,443
For trig, of course.

127
00:11:33,235 --> 00:11:34,236
For your mother?

128
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:35,821
No, for me.

129
00:11:37,323 --> 00:11:38,699
Right, right, right. Sorry.

130
00:11:40,492 --> 00:11:44,163
No, no, I'm sorry, I'm already
all booked up this semester.

131
00:11:45,247 --> 00:11:47,374
Wait, even on Friday nights?

132
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,002
Yeah. Even on Friday nights.

133
00:11:50,461 --> 00:11:52,963
Well, that's too bad. Yeah.

134
00:11:53,589 --> 00:11:55,799
I guess I'll just... I'll
see you around, then?

135
00:11:56,342 --> 00:11:57,426
Yeah, I'll see you in class.

136
00:11:57,843 --> 00:11:59,011
Okay, I'll see you around.

137
00:12:00,262 --> 00:12:01,263
I'll see you in class.

138
00:12:01,597 --> 00:12:02,598
Okay.

139
00:12:04,433 --> 00:12:06,810
When I went to talk to him in the class,
he got all blushy.

140
00:12:06,894 --> 00:12:09,563
- He got all red when I was talking to him.
- Oh, God! He's your teacher.

141
00:12:09,647 --> 00:12:11,690
- No, I don't care.
- Shut up.

142
00:12:11,774 --> 00:12:14,276
Okay, look. Chad's over there.
Do you wanna go?

143
00:12:14,318 --> 00:12:15,486
- No, it's fine.
- Why?

144
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:17,696
- Why?
- 'Cause she'd be happy if we left.

145
00:12:18,864 --> 00:12:20,449
Why is she always with them?

146
00:12:20,616 --> 00:12:23,285
Because she's a Post-it.
She sticks to everything.

147
00:12:23,327 --> 00:12:25,162
In that outfit, really? No.

148
00:12:25,204 --> 00:12:26,205
I know.

149
00:12:26,288 --> 00:12:27,915
I really like your shirt.

150
00:12:28,207 --> 00:12:30,668
- Yeah, I like what's under your shirt.
- Hey! Stop.

151
00:12:31,335 --> 00:12:33,629
- What up, what up, what up?
- Can I talk to you for a second?

152
00:12:34,463 --> 00:12:36,173
- Go ahead.
- Let's go.

153
00:12:36,382 --> 00:12:37,383
It's all right.

154
00:12:38,926 --> 00:12:42,930
So, now that you're giving it up
to everybody,

155
00:12:43,013 --> 00:12:44,974
- I figured maybe I could get some.
- Are you serious?

156
00:12:47,476 --> 00:12:48,477
What was all that about?

157
00:12:49,895 --> 00:12:52,273
- Classy, bro.
- What do you care?

158
00:12:55,901 --> 00:12:59,947
<i>"I hate Chad. I hate every stupid second
I spent obsessing over him!"</i>

159
00:13:00,614 --> 00:13:01,865
<i>"What a waste!"</i>

160
00:13:08,414 --> 00:13:12,251
<i>- So, can I come over tonight?
- No, we can't do this every night.</i>

161
00:13:12,668 --> 00:13:13,919
<i>What's the point of being divorced?</i>

162
00:13:18,716 --> 00:13:22,469
<i>"Oh, my God!
Dad's totally hooking up with Mom again!"</i>

163
00:13:22,553 --> 00:13:23,887
<i>"Or is it the other way around?"</i>

164
00:13:23,929 --> 00:13:26,557
<i>"Whatever it is,
I just can't go through this again."</i>

165
00:13:27,558 --> 00:13:31,437
Okay, so after Jimmy Carter, it was Ron...

166
00:13:31,645 --> 00:13:32,771
Ronald.

167
00:13:33,731 --> 00:13:35,232
Ronald McDonald?

168
00:13:35,441 --> 00:13:36,859
You're so stupid.

169
00:13:37,318 --> 00:13:39,278
Ethan, please try to be human.

170
00:13:40,154 --> 00:13:42,698
Okay, so, Ronald Reagan.

171
00:13:43,073 --> 00:13:47,244
<i>I still can't believe
the secret guy Mom's dating is Dad.</i>

172
00:13:47,995 --> 00:13:49,413
<i>What else is she hiding?</i>

173
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:52,499
What? What's With that look?

174
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:54,918
Nothing. Just looking.

175
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:02,384
Okay, so, keep going. Ronald Reagan...

176
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:07,765
- Take off your shoes.
- Why? The kids are sleeping.

177
00:14:09,433 --> 00:14:10,684
The floor creaks.

178
00:14:12,102 --> 00:14:14,605
- Like a thief in my own home.
- Ex-home.

179
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,443
You think it's a mistake
I'm seeing my ex-husband again?

180
00:14:24,239 --> 00:14:25,240
Yes?

181
00:14:25,783 --> 00:14:26,784
No?

182
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:32,373
Could you stop saying...
And just give me a real answer?

183
00:14:40,464 --> 00:14:41,673
Stop it, Ethan!

184
00:14:47,388 --> 00:14:48,389
Jackson!

185
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:50,140
Stop it.

186
00:14:50,766 --> 00:14:52,309
Jackson, shut up!

187
00:14:52,643 --> 00:14:54,061
Stop it. Shove it up your ass.

188
00:14:54,144 --> 00:14:55,479
Mom, did you hear that?

189
00:14:56,146 --> 00:14:57,564
Lola, language.

190
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:02,820
Jackson! I'm going to kill you.
I swear to God!

191
00:15:03,237 --> 00:15:06,323
I am so tired of that.
Give it to me. Give it to me.

192
00:15:08,158 --> 00:15:09,159
- Mom!
- You!

193
00:15:09,243 --> 00:15:10,244
Mommy!

194
00:15:10,828 --> 00:15:12,871
Mom, Emily won't let me practice.

195
00:15:13,664 --> 00:15:14,832
It's time for dinner.

196
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:18,752
<i>Dinner's on the table. You were supposed
to be here a half an hour ago.</i>

197
00:15:18,961 --> 00:15:20,462
Fine, okay. I'm coming back.

198
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:22,756
<i>- You know your father!</i>
- Okay. Whatever.

199
00:15:24,258 --> 00:15:25,843
Sorry, guys, I gotta bail.

200
00:15:25,884 --> 00:15:27,845
Bail? Dude, we got to practice. Come on.

201
00:15:27,928 --> 00:15:30,013
- No, I'll make it up next time, I promise.
- Make it up?

202
00:15:30,347 --> 00:15:32,975
Bro, we're gonna suck if we don't practice.
Battle of the Bands is coming up.

203
00:15:33,016 --> 00:15:34,768
We're not going to suck, dude.
We're putting in the time.

204
00:15:34,852 --> 00:15:35,853
It's going to be fine, okay?

205
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:44,770
Dude, these kids practice every day,
all right?

206
00:15:49,366 --> 00:15:51,910
We wanna see you all at the show.
No Shampoo.

207
00:15:54,037 --> 00:15:55,038
Semifinals!

208
00:15:56,707 --> 00:16:00,461
Ladies get in free, come check us out.
No Shampoo. Guys, $10.

209
00:16:01,295 --> 00:16:02,296
Come check them out.

210
00:16:02,463 --> 00:16:06,675
- What kind of music?
- Indie. A little bit of everything.

211
00:16:06,717 --> 00:16:08,427
Well, if you're there, I'm there.

212
00:16:09,761 --> 00:16:11,263
You're passing out flyers now?

213
00:16:11,972 --> 00:16:14,766
Yeah, but apparently, it works better
if you're pretty.

214
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:17,269
Like you would know.

215
00:16:17,561 --> 00:16:18,645
Don't be jealous.

216
00:16:18,854 --> 00:16:20,856
- Don't worry.
- I never do.

217
00:17:14,618 --> 00:17:17,120
I swear, guys,
if we don't make it through after that...

218
00:17:17,162 --> 00:17:18,455
Oh, my God, you're going to make it.

219
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:19,790
All right.

220
00:17:19,831 --> 00:17:21,625
- You did so good.
- You think so?

221
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,794
- I know so.
- Thanks.

222
00:17:23,835 --> 00:17:25,587
- "I know so."
- "I know so."

223
00:17:25,629 --> 00:17:26,964
You really are amazing.

224
00:17:27,005 --> 00:17:29,341
No, you're amazing.

225
00:17:33,345 --> 00:17:34,346
Kyle!

226
00:17:35,639 --> 00:17:36,640
You coming?

227
00:17:37,307 --> 00:17:38,725
Yeah, yeah.

228
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:41,311
Come on.

229
00:17:44,523 --> 00:17:46,108
We're going to rock it next time.

230
00:18:04,251 --> 00:18:05,419
There he is.

231
00:18:06,044 --> 00:18:07,045
So, where you been?

232
00:18:07,337 --> 00:18:09,673
At Chad's. Working on our history project.

233
00:18:10,007 --> 00:18:11,008
How did it go?

234
00:18:11,174 --> 00:18:14,011
It went really great.
It's about the Industrial Revolution.

235
00:18:14,344 --> 00:18:15,345
Hon, want some soup?

236
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:17,764
Thank you.

237
00:18:19,891 --> 00:18:23,562
So, hey, Dad, remember that
Battle of the Bands thing I told you about?

238
00:18:24,605 --> 00:18:26,440
The winners, they get a record deal.

239
00:18:27,024 --> 00:18:30,110
It's really more of a showcase,
but we might have a spot.

240
00:18:31,069 --> 00:18:32,070
Pass me the salt.

241
00:18:34,364 --> 00:18:35,782
Did you hear what I said?

242
00:18:36,116 --> 00:18:37,743
Yeah. Did you hear what I said?

243
00:18:38,493 --> 00:18:40,412
We'll talk about music
when your grades are better.

244
00:18:48,003 --> 00:18:49,004
Thank you.

245
00:18:53,842 --> 00:18:55,427
Lola, I said no.

246
00:18:55,719 --> 00:18:58,722
I'm on my way home. I'm at the courthouse.

247
00:18:59,181 --> 00:19:03,393
Because I got a ticket. You know what?
Enough with this inquisition.

248
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,936
I'm going to just see you at home.

249
00:19:09,232 --> 00:19:10,233
Oh, shit!

250
00:19:10,275 --> 00:19:11,276
Really?

251
00:19:13,654 --> 00:19:14,655
Need some help?

252
00:19:15,113 --> 00:19:16,740
Not unless you can fix this.

253
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,575
Not exactly my skill set.

254
00:19:18,742 --> 00:19:21,078
- Then too bad.
- Too bad.

255
00:19:22,412 --> 00:19:25,248
- So, where are we going?
- What?

256
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:28,126
You can't limp home, and I doubt
you'll find a cab this time of day.

257
00:19:28,418 --> 00:19:32,089
Well, they kept me in there forever.
Stupid asshole cops, giving me a ticket.

258
00:19:32,589 --> 00:19:34,925
Just because
my registration's expired one day.

259
00:19:37,761 --> 00:19:38,970
You're not gonna find a cab.

260
00:19:40,889 --> 00:19:42,599
Trust me, I'm a very safe driver.

261
00:19:44,935 --> 00:19:45,936
Okay.

262
00:19:49,523 --> 00:19:51,024
- Need some help?
- Yeah.

263
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:02,452
Come on. What are you waiting for?

264
00:20:03,787 --> 00:20:07,332
But, hey, what about your helmet?
The cops will just bust you for anything.

265
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:09,126
Don't worry about it. We'll be okay.

266
00:20:10,293 --> 00:20:11,461
Have a good one, Detective.

267
00:20:11,545 --> 00:20:12,921
You, too, have a good one.

268
00:20:16,007 --> 00:20:17,342
- Ready?
- Yeah.

269
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:40,574
Let me help you with that.
It gets stuck sometimes.

270
00:20:40,657 --> 00:20:41,658
Okay.

271
00:20:51,626 --> 00:20:56,339
Thanks. I'm sorry I insulted
your entire profession.

272
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,508
It's okay, I'm kind of used to it.

273
00:20:59,176 --> 00:21:00,802
Appreciate the rescue.

274
00:21:01,845 --> 00:21:02,846
Anytime.

275
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,601
Is he hot?

276
00:21:08,935 --> 00:21:10,061
You're so bad.

277
00:21:10,687 --> 00:21:15,400
It doesn't matter, because I'm not gonna
go out with some random cop.

278
00:21:15,484 --> 00:21:18,820
All right, well then, one night.
Quick and dirty. One night.

279
00:21:18,862 --> 00:21:21,364
No, 'cause that's really not my style.

280
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:22,491
With a guy?

281
00:21:22,657 --> 00:21:24,117
No, the quick and dirty.

282
00:21:25,076 --> 00:21:27,329
Okay, well, you've been divorced
for more than a year.

283
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:29,080
It's time to step it up. Get your game on.

284
00:21:29,164 --> 00:21:31,166
Let me tell you something,
if I was a divorced woman...

285
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:32,459
If you were a divorced woman, what?

286
00:21:33,418 --> 00:21:34,878
Nothing. Nothing.

287
00:21:35,212 --> 00:21:37,214
- Nothing.
- Everything.

288
00:21:37,589 --> 00:21:40,717
I'd sleep with a different guy
every single night. Just like you do.

289
00:21:41,051 --> 00:21:43,386
Oh, really?
Well, I haven't slept with anybody but you.

290
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:46,264
I'm not talking about you.
I'm talking about men. Men.

291
00:21:46,348 --> 00:21:51,603
You mean us. You mean us men.
The great confederation of bastards.

292
00:21:51,686 --> 00:21:53,021
Hey, look who's here.

293
00:21:53,271 --> 00:21:56,233
- Mom, Jeremy got a scooter.
- Jeremy got a scooter.

294
00:21:56,316 --> 00:21:57,901
Jeremy got a scooter?

295
00:21:58,026 --> 00:21:59,736
- Yeah. Dad said it was cool.
- Surprise!

296
00:21:59,778 --> 00:22:01,655
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I got the kid a scooter.

297
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:03,281
Wait, excuse me. We discussed this.

298
00:22:03,448 --> 00:22:06,743
I think I should get one, too.
I could avoid being late for school.

299
00:22:06,868 --> 00:22:08,495
- It's not gonna happen.
- Why?

300
00:22:08,578 --> 00:22:10,163
Because I'm not gonna go

301
00:22:10,247 --> 00:22:12,624
and be peeling you up off of the sidewalk
because you've splattered...

302
00:22:12,707 --> 00:22:13,959
That's dramatic.

303
00:22:14,626 --> 00:22:16,545
It's not dramatic. And it's not happening.

304
00:22:16,628 --> 00:22:17,629
Whatever.

305
00:22:18,171 --> 00:22:19,256
Where are you going?

306
00:22:19,381 --> 00:22:21,216
I've got to show Jeremy
something on the computer.

307
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:22,300
How can you make that decision without...

308
00:22:22,384 --> 00:22:24,845
- I know. But I've set the table.
- We'll come back.

309
00:22:24,928 --> 00:22:27,097
It's just we're not really interested
in the senior conversations.

310
00:22:27,138 --> 00:22:28,139
Yeah. Thanks, Dad.

311
00:22:28,223 --> 00:22:29,224
- What?
- Senior...

312
00:22:29,266 --> 00:22:31,768
We're not interested
in your teenage conversations.

313
00:22:31,852 --> 00:22:33,103
- Senior conversations?
- Are you serious?

314
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:35,188
- She's so polite.
- I'm dyeing my beard.

315
00:22:38,775 --> 00:22:39,776
What do you think?

316
00:22:39,943 --> 00:22:41,695
Not bad. Who is it?

317
00:22:41,862 --> 00:22:42,863
It's my friend, Kyle.

318
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:44,948
Okay, Mr. Kyle.

319
00:22:45,073 --> 00:22:46,074
Shut up.

320
00:22:47,117 --> 00:22:48,118
Does Lola smoke?

321
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:49,411
Are you crazy?

322
00:22:50,203 --> 00:22:52,122
Do you smoke in front of her?

323
00:22:52,956 --> 00:22:55,876
Never. What about Jeremy?

324
00:22:56,376 --> 00:22:58,712
Don't worry about Jeremy. He hates drugs.

325
00:23:00,046 --> 00:23:02,883
I think I'm going to surfing camp.
What about you?

326
00:23:03,508 --> 00:23:05,635
I don't know, but my dad
is totally doing my mom again.

327
00:23:06,052 --> 00:23:08,471
No shit. You cool with that?

328
00:23:08,638 --> 00:23:11,349
No. I'm sick of them lying to me
and I know that it's never going to work.

329
00:23:12,142 --> 00:23:13,143
I know the feeling.

330
00:23:19,941 --> 00:23:21,484
So, I need to ask you a favor.

331
00:23:21,818 --> 00:23:23,570
Okay. What do you need?

332
00:23:26,114 --> 00:23:27,115
I need you to sleep with me.

333
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:32,370
Now, women don't just screw.

334
00:23:33,455 --> 00:23:35,749
Okay? They need an emotional attachment.

335
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:38,168
- Do we?
- Though I will say this,

336
00:23:38,418 --> 00:23:41,671
that no matter how liberated
you women think you are,

337
00:23:41,713 --> 00:23:44,799
male sexuality and female sexuality,
very different.

338
00:23:45,175 --> 00:23:48,803
Come on, what's the big deal?
It's not like I asked you for euthanasia.

339
00:23:48,845 --> 00:23:51,640
It's just one little favor.
You've known me forever. Come on.

340
00:23:51,681 --> 00:23:52,682
It's not just a little favor.

341
00:23:52,807 --> 00:23:54,893
Okay. What would you say if I asked you?

342
00:23:54,976 --> 00:23:56,227
Yes.

343
00:23:57,270 --> 00:24:05,270
I say no, okay? I respect you too much.

344
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:08,365
All right, fine, next subject.

345
00:24:09,407 --> 00:24:10,533
Why don't you do it with Mr. Kyle?

346
00:24:10,909 --> 00:24:13,912
Because he thinks I did it already,
and if I ask him,

347
00:24:13,995 --> 00:24:16,706
then he's going to know that I'm lying.
And so will Chad.

348
00:24:17,707 --> 00:24:18,875
You women really are nuts.

349
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:21,628
We are not nuts.
Since Lucy has broken up with Rick,

350
00:24:21,962 --> 00:24:23,546
she's going out with a ton of guys.

351
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,757
Everybody knows that Lucy is a slut.

352
00:24:26,675 --> 00:24:30,887
She's having the time of her life.
And I doubt anyone's farting in her bed.

353
00:24:32,305 --> 00:24:33,556
I'm so sorry.

354
00:24:33,848 --> 00:24:35,058
You used to love my farts.

355
00:24:35,183 --> 00:24:36,559
I was lying to you.

356
00:24:36,601 --> 00:24:39,229
What about you and Allen?
You guys still see each other?

357
00:24:40,397 --> 00:24:41,773
Just with the kids.

358
00:24:42,816 --> 00:24:50,816
Good, because we saw Allen the other day
with the biggest bimbo.

359
00:24:54,744 --> 00:24:56,371
Doesn't mean anything. Okay?

360
00:24:57,455 --> 00:24:59,332
Oh, shit, did I just say something dumb?

361
00:25:01,334 --> 00:25:02,335
Not at all.

362
00:25:03,795 --> 00:25:04,796
Why?

363
00:25:07,424 --> 00:25:08,717
- More pie?
- Yes, please.

364
00:25:08,758 --> 00:25:10,385
- I'd love some. Thanks.
- Yes.

365
00:25:24,774 --> 00:25:25,775
Hey!

366
00:25:26,818 --> 00:25:28,278
Are you seeing someone else?

367
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,321
What?

368
00:25:31,364 --> 00:25:32,365
You heard me.

369
00:25:34,492 --> 00:25:35,493
You mean,

370
00:25:37,454 --> 00:25:41,458
am I sleeping with someone else?

371
00:25:41,958 --> 00:25:42,959
Exactly.

372
00:25:45,003 --> 00:25:46,713
What is wrong with you?

373
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:50,550
So you're not seeing anyone else
besides me?

374
00:25:55,263 --> 00:25:57,849
I don't know.
I thought we were back together.

375
00:25:57,932 --> 00:26:00,351
Why are you even asking me this?

376
00:26:00,435 --> 00:26:02,035
Are we?

377
00:26:20,205 --> 00:26:21,331
I wish I had her ass, though.

378
00:26:21,664 --> 00:26:23,208
- Come on.
- What?

379
00:26:23,291 --> 00:26:25,293
That ass is a full-time job for her.

380
00:26:25,502 --> 00:26:28,129
You know what,
no matter if I work out and I do anything,

381
00:26:28,171 --> 00:26:29,881
my ass is always going to be flat.

382
00:26:32,967 --> 00:26:35,887
Em? Are those Care Bears on your undies?

383
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:39,349
Shut up, okay? It's all my mom will buy.
What am I supposed to do about it?

384
00:26:39,432 --> 00:26:41,893
Mom just got a ton of stuff
from Victoria's Secret that doesn't fit.

385
00:26:41,976 --> 00:26:43,311
And she's not gonna return it.
Do you want it?

386
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,105
- Yeah.
- Okay.

387
00:26:45,522 --> 00:26:47,190
Yeah, no, I need something
that Colin's going to like.

388
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,483
Who's Colin?

389
00:26:48,566 --> 00:26:50,235
Mr. Ross. The trig teacher.

390
00:26:50,985 --> 00:26:52,320
- Are you kidding me?
- Nope.

391
00:26:52,362 --> 00:26:53,363
- Don't worry about it.
- You're sick.

392
00:26:53,905 --> 00:26:55,615
- Double. Double. Double.
- You're sick.

393
00:26:55,698 --> 00:26:56,950
- You're sick.
- You're sick.

394
00:27:00,662 --> 00:27:02,831
Emily, Emily, free me.
Come on, I love you, please.

395
00:27:02,956 --> 00:27:04,457
- Okay, go bother somebody else.
- I love you.

396
00:27:04,541 --> 00:27:05,542
No, come on.

397
00:27:08,545 --> 00:27:10,505
- Hey, watch it.
- I was just going for the ball.

398
00:27:10,964 --> 00:27:12,090
Hey, Lola, are you okay?

399
00:27:12,173 --> 00:27:13,925
- Let's go.
- It's not funny. Why are you laughing?

400
00:27:14,342 --> 00:27:16,010
It's always funny when someone falls.

401
00:27:16,052 --> 00:27:17,387
Yo, can we play? Come on.

402
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,472
Walk away. Just ignore him. He's a jerk.

403
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:27,730
- Stop following me.
- You wish.

404
00:27:28,064 --> 00:27:30,191
- Skank-ass ho.
- Stop calling me that!

405
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,277
Stop calling me that!

406
00:27:34,904 --> 00:27:37,490
- Hey, come on. Leave it.
- You're pretty hot when you're mad.

407
00:27:37,574 --> 00:27:40,243
- Screw you!
- Lola, walk away!

408
00:27:40,326 --> 00:27:42,203
- Just get out of here. Leave it. Come on.
- Are you kidding me?

409
00:27:42,245 --> 00:27:43,997
Come on, come on, leave it. Seriously.

410
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:49,127
- Lola, stop.
- Come on, come on.

411
00:27:49,669 --> 00:27:50,795
Kyle, the hero.

412
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:57,135
Look, it's not my fault.
He won't quit harassing me.

413
00:27:57,218 --> 00:27:58,219
You wish.

414
00:27:58,261 --> 00:28:00,305
Now you guys are harassing me.

415
00:28:01,681 --> 00:28:03,057
Please don't call my mom.

416
00:28:04,267 --> 00:28:06,686
- Give me your phone.
- No, Mom, please, you can't do that.

417
00:28:06,769 --> 00:28:10,231
Yes, I can. Bad grades are one thing,
but this is unacceptable.

418
00:28:10,273 --> 00:28:13,818
- Mom, I swear it's not my fault.
- Whose fault is it, then?

419
00:28:14,402 --> 00:28:15,403
I don't want to talk about it.

420
00:28:15,528 --> 00:28:17,947
Fine! You don't want to talk about it,
then give me your phone.

421
00:28:18,031 --> 00:28:19,324
I don't have it. It's at Janice's.

422
00:28:19,949 --> 00:28:21,993
It's at Janice's. Mom.

423
00:28:25,622 --> 00:28:27,248
No, Mom! That's not fair!

424
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:29,918
You want to know what's not fair
is me being called out of a client meeting

425
00:28:29,959 --> 00:28:32,462
because you started a fight in school.
- It's not my fault.

426
00:28:32,503 --> 00:28:35,965
And you know what, that whole little
Friday night get-together deal is off.

427
00:28:37,926 --> 00:28:39,636
Chad called me a ho, okay?

428
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:43,556
Do you want me to let it go
and say thank you?

429
00:28:44,265 --> 00:28:45,266
Your Chad?

430
00:28:46,142 --> 00:28:47,644
He's not my Chad any more, Mom.

431
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:51,981
Why did he call you that?

432
00:28:53,107 --> 00:28:54,359
God, do you have to know everything?

433
00:28:56,027 --> 00:29:00,156
Yeah, I do if you want your phone back.

434
00:29:00,281 --> 00:29:01,866
- Stop.
- And look here.

435
00:29:01,991 --> 00:29:03,576
- You're getting a text from Emily.
- No.

436
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:06,329
- And she says, "Hey."
- Mom, stop!

437
00:29:09,666 --> 00:29:12,168
Chad slept with somebody else,
so to pretend I was okay with it,

438
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:13,544
I said that I did, too. Okay?

439
00:29:14,712 --> 00:29:16,547
- Did you?
- No.

440
00:29:16,631 --> 00:29:19,008
Is that all you care about
is if I had sex or not?

441
00:29:19,175 --> 00:29:21,386
No, that is not all that I care about.

442
00:29:21,469 --> 00:29:24,722
I don't want you making stupid mistakes
out of spite.

443
00:29:25,515 --> 00:29:27,267
Baby, I care about you.

444
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,687
I know. I'm sorry, Mom.

445
00:29:31,145 --> 00:29:32,855
Why didn't you talk to me?

446
00:29:34,357 --> 00:29:36,859
- I love you, Mom.
- I love you, baby.

447
00:29:38,069 --> 00:29:40,029
Can I have my phone back now?

448
00:29:44,784 --> 00:29:46,119
And have my party on Friday?

449
00:29:47,578 --> 00:29:48,579
Two friends.

450
00:29:49,247 --> 00:29:50,248
Six.

451
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:51,958
- Four.
- Deal.

452
00:31:55,456 --> 00:31:59,627
<i>"I can't love him, but I do.
I feel so real with him."</i>

453
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:02,880
<i>"If he figures it out,
it will totally ruin our friendship."</i>

454
00:32:02,964 --> 00:32:05,049
<i>"Okay, I'm just going to have to hide it. "</i>

455
00:32:23,443 --> 00:32:25,027
Hey, Lol?

456
00:32:25,111 --> 00:32:29,365
Maybe we should...
I don't want Chad to get the wrong idea.

457
00:32:29,866 --> 00:32:31,367
He's so jealous.

458
00:32:31,409 --> 00:32:33,077
I don't blame him.

459
00:32:34,078 --> 00:32:37,081
Well, I'm flattered
you still want to hang out with me.

460
00:32:38,207 --> 00:32:39,542
I love hanging outwith you.

461
00:32:40,209 --> 00:32:41,294
Go.

462
00:32:41,377 --> 00:32:43,337
- Okay, I'll see you later.
- See you later.

463
00:33:25,338 --> 00:33:26,756
Where's my chicken?

464
00:33:42,271 --> 00:33:43,272
Jackson!

465
00:33:43,356 --> 00:33:44,357
My chicken.

466
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:51,781
Jackson.

467
00:33:53,199 --> 00:33:54,867
- What?
- My chicken. Where is it?

468
00:33:55,201 --> 00:33:56,202
How should I know?

469
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:59,705
Oh, really? What is that?

470
00:33:59,914 --> 00:34:03,376
- Mom, I swear...
- I will not tolerate lying in my home.

471
00:34:09,674 --> 00:34:10,967
I hate my life.

472
00:34:12,802 --> 00:34:14,303
Wait, where did you say you were going?

473
00:34:14,387 --> 00:34:17,431
It's just a spa weekend with the girls.

474
00:34:17,515 --> 00:34:18,516
What girls?

475
00:34:19,433 --> 00:34:21,644
Actually, you don't know them.

476
00:34:22,019 --> 00:34:25,731
You have friends that I don't know?
Like who?

477
00:34:27,608 --> 00:34:29,610
So, wait, why aren't Emma and Ethan
going with Dad?

478
00:34:29,652 --> 00:34:31,404
Because he's going out of town
this weekend.

479
00:34:31,946 --> 00:34:33,322
- So, Mom...
- Yes, dear.

480
00:34:33,364 --> 00:34:34,991
- You got this covered?
- Yes, dear.

481
00:34:35,074 --> 00:34:37,952
- She gets to have three friends.
- Only three. I mean it.

482
00:34:37,994 --> 00:34:40,538
- And pizza.
- Only pizza. That's it.

483
00:34:40,663 --> 00:34:41,664
I kind of want Chinese.

484
00:34:41,706 --> 00:34:44,834
And don't let them sweet-talk you,
because they are ruthless.

485
00:34:44,917 --> 00:34:48,004
- Me?
- Really? What a surprise! Chinese it is.

486
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:50,590
- Okay, here you go.
- Here's your bag.

487
00:34:53,175 --> 00:34:54,176
Are you guys trying to get rid of me?

488
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,344
- No.
- Yes.

489
00:34:55,845 --> 00:34:57,013
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

490
00:34:58,097 --> 00:34:59,974
- Love you, Mom.
- Love you.

491
00:35:00,016 --> 00:35:02,393
- Party time.
- No way. Three friends.

492
00:35:02,476 --> 00:35:03,519
- Come on.
- Maybe five.

493
00:35:03,644 --> 00:35:04,687
- Come on.
- Just five.

494
00:35:04,729 --> 00:35:06,147
You know when she says three,
she means like 30.

495
00:35:06,188 --> 00:35:08,024
- No, she doesn't.
- Come on. Be cool.

496
00:35:08,107 --> 00:35:09,108
That's as cool as I get.

497
00:35:13,654 --> 00:35:15,865
You knew she was gonna go
spend the weekend with Dad.

498
00:35:15,948 --> 00:35:19,577
Yes, it's so romantic.
They're sneaking around like teenagers.

499
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:23,164
Unfortunately, teenagers
aren't like that any more.

500
00:35:23,539 --> 00:35:25,166
Oh, sweet pea.

501
00:35:27,376 --> 00:35:29,003
They're so cute.

502
00:35:29,545 --> 00:35:30,671
I guess so.

503
00:35:41,307 --> 00:35:44,393
- So, do you play basketball?
- Yeah, I play a lot.

504
00:35:44,852 --> 00:35:47,021
- How tall are you?
- I'm about 6'2".

505
00:35:48,105 --> 00:35:50,232
Excuse me, ma'am.
Would you like something to drink?

506
00:35:50,358 --> 00:35:53,152
Thank you, honey.
I'll have a Coke with a little scotch.

507
00:35:53,319 --> 00:35:55,696
Actually, make that a scotch
with a little Coke.

508
00:35:56,739 --> 00:35:57,740
Not so much.

509
00:35:57,865 --> 00:36:00,576
Listen, this is going to help her sleep,
then we're going to party all night.

510
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:01,911
I'm gonna go to hell.

511
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:03,621
You're such a chicken.

512
00:36:04,705 --> 00:36:06,624
- Here's your drink.
- Thanks, sweetie.

513
00:36:10,544 --> 00:36:12,713
- So, how is it?
- It's good.

514
00:36:12,755 --> 00:36:13,798
Thank you for making me a drink.

515
00:36:15,925 --> 00:36:19,011
But then she never called me back.
I see you. Where you going?

516
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:20,888
Wait, I'm going to call
you later, all right?

517
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:21,931
See you, Wen.

518
00:36:22,682 --> 00:36:25,059
Wen, Wen, is that your T-shirt?

519
00:36:25,768 --> 00:36:27,019
I don't know.

520
00:36:27,937 --> 00:36:28,938
Okay, shut up.

521
00:36:30,606 --> 00:36:32,733
No, but is it vintage?

522
00:36:33,192 --> 00:36:35,611
- Is it vintage?
- Or is it new?

523
00:36:35,653 --> 00:36:36,696
- I don't know.
- Are there a lot of them?

524
00:36:36,779 --> 00:36:38,572
Did you borrow it from somebody else?

525
00:36:38,739 --> 00:36:40,157
No, no, it's neither.

526
00:36:41,075 --> 00:36:42,702
Oh, dear God! Okay...

527
00:36:43,452 --> 00:36:45,871
I'm just... Okay.

528
00:36:46,288 --> 00:36:48,332
- I'm gonna go.
- Are you all right?

529
00:37:07,309 --> 00:37:10,479
- I really want to kiss you.
- Me too.

530
00:37:10,813 --> 00:37:12,440
Let's party, yeah!

531
00:38:11,207 --> 00:38:14,418
<i>Friendship is not that
easy to turn into love.</i>

532
00:38:14,502 --> 00:38:18,881
<i>Good news, we laughed a lot,
and I just think we both weren't ready.</i>

533
00:38:18,964 --> 00:38:21,926
<i>But still, it was</i> a <i>perfect night.</i>

534
00:38:22,426 --> 00:38:23,511
<i>Bad news?</i>

535
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:30,684
<i>Mom left Dad again and she came home
a little bit earlier than I expected.</i>

536
00:38:34,522 --> 00:38:35,606
Lola!

537
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:41,111
Honey, I'll help you with the garbage.

538
00:38:41,529 --> 00:38:42,947
Thanks, Mom, you've done enough.

539
00:38:46,075 --> 00:38:47,076
Hey, Mom.

540
00:38:49,245 --> 00:38:51,747
What first, joints or condoms?

541
00:38:51,789 --> 00:38:54,250
- It wasn't me.
- That's not funny, Mom.

542
00:38:54,583 --> 00:38:57,711
- I can explain.
- I would so love for you to explain.

543
00:38:58,045 --> 00:39:00,840
- I know that this looks bad.
- It looks really bad.

544
00:39:00,923 --> 00:39:02,758
Mom, I had no idea
that these people were coming.

545
00:39:02,842 --> 00:39:04,969
I just had my friends.
People from school showed up.

546
00:39:05,052 --> 00:39:07,388
- I don't know how this happened.
- Mom, how could you let this happen?

547
00:39:07,471 --> 00:39:11,100
Honey, I just don't know. I can't seem
to hold my drinks like I used to.

548
00:39:12,768 --> 00:39:13,769
And what about this?

549
00:39:14,562 --> 00:39:17,815
I wasn't smoking. I don't smoke. Mom!

550
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:21,277
If I ever catch you with this again, I am
shipping you off to your dad's! Got it?

551
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,112
That would be a dream, huh, Mom?

552
00:39:23,195 --> 00:39:25,322
And don't worry,
I'll see you there in the morning.

553
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:31,662
Your Paris trip is off. And you're gonna
come back and clean this mess!

554
00:39:33,664 --> 00:39:36,208
<i>"I can't believe I screwed
things up this bad."</i>

555
00:39:36,458 --> 00:39:39,962
<i>"Why can't I rewind in real life?
What a mess!"</i>

556
00:39:42,256 --> 00:39:45,801
Lloyd, get your lazy ass over here
so we can rehearse, man. Call me back.

557
00:39:47,887 --> 00:39:48,888
He's not even picking up.

558
00:39:51,515 --> 00:39:52,516
So, how was the party?

559
00:39:54,268 --> 00:39:56,979
It was okay.

560
00:39:59,481 --> 00:40:00,482
Do anything fun?

561
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:03,068
Well, you know, the grandma was there.

562
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:20,127
Why is Lola vacuuming, Mom?

563
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:21,211
Ask her.

564
00:41:06,507 --> 00:41:07,508
Anne.

565
00:41:08,467 --> 00:41:09,593
What do you want?

566
00:41:09,677 --> 00:41:11,720
Would love for us to stop fighting
over nothing.

567
00:41:12,137 --> 00:41:16,141
Nothing? You call sleeping
with random sluts nothing?

568
00:41:16,225 --> 00:41:18,894
- Anne...
<i>- I can't... I can't do this.</i>

569
00:41:18,978 --> 00:41:22,106
You know what? You are the best thing
in my life and you are also the worst.

570
00:41:22,189 --> 00:41:25,526
- Anne, I swear, I never slept with any...
<i>- Stop swearing.</i>

571
00:41:25,609 --> 00:41:28,737
And more importantly,
will you stop lying to me? All of you.

572
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:32,700
<i>I think we just need to stick
to being what we're meant to be.</i>

573
00:41:32,741 --> 00:41:33,909
Which is?

574
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:35,661
Parents to our kids.

575
00:41:37,746 --> 00:41:39,331
<i>- I got to go.</i>
- Anne, please don't...

576
00:41:56,598 --> 00:41:58,183
This is gonna be good.

577
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:02,604
Wow. Your sister is hot. Hi, I'm Chad.

578
00:42:02,646 --> 00:42:04,106
She's not my sister.

579
00:42:04,189 --> 00:42:05,816
Actually, I'm her step-mother.

580
00:42:05,899 --> 00:42:07,776
And she's my wife, pal.

581
00:42:10,404 --> 00:42:12,948
Settle down, please. Quiet, please.

582
00:42:13,073 --> 00:42:14,366
Quiet!

583
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:17,244
Welcome, parents and students.

584
00:42:17,286 --> 00:42:18,662
Hello.

585
00:42:18,746 --> 00:42:20,581
- Oh, my gosh. He's so cute.
- Check him out.

586
00:42:20,622 --> 00:42:23,667
We have a detective
from the Narcotics Division

587
00:42:23,751 --> 00:42:25,461
of the Chicago Police Department.

588
00:42:26,128 --> 00:42:27,463
He's here to talk to you today.

589
00:42:27,546 --> 00:42:30,549
So, please,
give him your undivided attention.

590
00:42:30,674 --> 00:42:32,301
He's got my attention.

591
00:42:33,302 --> 00:42:34,970
What?

592
00:42:35,012 --> 00:42:37,514
Settle... Please, please, be quiet.

593
00:42:40,434 --> 00:42:42,603
I'm sure you all have
something better to do

594
00:42:42,644 --> 00:42:46,065
than sit here and listen to some guy
who thinks he's cool and educational.

595
00:42:46,148 --> 00:42:47,649
Yeah!

596
00:42:48,108 --> 00:42:49,359
I hear you, I hear you.

597
00:42:49,443 --> 00:42:51,361
But there's some facts
I need to arm you with.

598
00:42:51,445 --> 00:42:54,364
I have a picture
that shows the detrimental effects

599
00:42:54,490 --> 00:42:56,825
of long-term drug abuse. Take a look.

600
00:43:03,791 --> 00:43:05,125
Now that I have your attention,

601
00:43:05,167 --> 00:43:08,462
I want to show you
the real effects of THC on the brain.

602
00:43:08,545 --> 00:43:12,341
THC is the agent in pot that causes
the high in so-called "soft" drugs.

603
00:43:13,217 --> 00:43:16,804
You look at this image, it's pretty clear
it's not so soft any more, is it?

604
00:43:17,513 --> 00:43:21,558
Symptoms of cannabis
can range from paranoia to panic attacks,

605
00:43:21,642 --> 00:43:23,227
to symptoms of schizophrenia.

606
00:43:23,811 --> 00:43:25,437
- That was a very good talk.
- I know.

607
00:43:25,521 --> 00:43:27,147
- I hope some of that sticks into your head.
- Okay.

608
00:43:27,189 --> 00:43:28,232
Why are you running?

609
00:43:28,315 --> 00:43:31,193
Because there's someone
that I'd like to avoid.

610
00:43:31,276 --> 00:43:32,486
- There's Janice. I got to go.
- No, no.

611
00:43:32,528 --> 00:43:34,488
- We need to get... We need to get going.
- Hey.

612
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:36,949
- How you doing?
- Hey, how are you?

613
00:43:37,032 --> 00:43:38,158
Good. How is the heel?

614
00:43:38,617 --> 00:43:41,370
The heel is fine.

615
00:43:41,453 --> 00:43:44,540
Once is coincidence.
Twice, I'm going to have to call that fate.

616
00:43:44,873 --> 00:43:46,375
Is that what you call it?

617
00:43:46,458 --> 00:43:48,710
- Does she know him?
- Oh, God, I hope not.

618
00:43:49,461 --> 00:43:51,296
I think he's going to handcuff your mom
to your bed.

619
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:54,550
Shut up, shut up. Don't say that.

620
00:43:54,633 --> 00:43:56,593
- Are you coming tonight?
- I'll try, but I'm grounded.

621
00:43:57,386 --> 00:43:59,221
- Your artwork?
- Hey, look, look, look.

622
00:43:59,263 --> 00:44:01,223
- She's up to no good. I told you.
- Really?

623
00:44:01,265 --> 00:44:02,850
She's disgusting. I don't get it.

624
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:07,563
You know, that was so great, to the...
The talk in there. I...

625
00:44:07,646 --> 00:44:08,897
I'm gonna buy you a drink.

626
00:44:09,898 --> 00:44:11,650
I...

627
00:44:12,317 --> 00:44:14,695
It wasn't a question.
I'm telling you I'm gonna buy you a drink.

628
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:20,075
Mom. Can I go to Janice's house?
Just to do homework.

629
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:21,493
Lola, this is...

630
00:44:21,577 --> 00:44:22,619
- James.
- Hey.

631
00:44:22,703 --> 00:44:24,246
- My daughter, Lola.
- Mom, can I go?

632
00:44:24,872 --> 00:44:26,415
No, you have to do your homework at home.

633
00:44:26,456 --> 00:44:27,583
- This isn't fair.
- What was that?

634
00:44:27,666 --> 00:44:29,668
Nothing. Love you, Mom.

635
00:44:29,751 --> 00:44:31,003
I'll see you at home.

636
00:44:33,255 --> 00:44:34,506
Charming.

637
00:44:35,048 --> 00:44:36,175
You ready for a drink?

638
00:44:37,634 --> 00:44:40,470
- I thought it wasn't a question.
- It's not.

639
00:44:42,431 --> 00:44:44,474
- Okay. This... All right.
- Yeah.

640
00:44:45,934 --> 00:44:48,061
- Have you seen Kyle?
- Yeah, he's in the bathroom.

641
00:44:56,695 --> 00:44:58,113
Hey...

642
00:45:13,545 --> 00:45:15,047
So how was it?

643
00:45:16,173 --> 00:45:18,675
- It was awesome.
- You're disgusting.

644
00:45:20,802 --> 00:45:22,346
- Was it good?
- What do you mean?

645
00:45:23,138 --> 00:45:25,724
Come on, don't lie to me.
Just own up to it.

646
00:45:27,017 --> 00:45:29,770
Hey, Lol. What's going on?
What did you tell her?

647
00:45:29,811 --> 00:45:33,523
Nothing. It's not my fault
your little groupie can't take a joke.

648
00:45:34,066 --> 00:45:37,486
Hey, Lol, wait up! Hey, Lol, stop. Please.

649
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:48,288
I need to go.

650
00:45:48,330 --> 00:45:50,958
- I knew that. Come here.
- Okay, Wen. Stop it. Okay?

651
00:45:50,999 --> 00:45:54,211
- What are you doing?
- What just happened never happened.

652
00:45:54,294 --> 00:45:55,420
Got it?

653
00:45:55,504 --> 00:45:57,214
- You're funny.
- No, I'm serious, okay?

654
00:45:57,339 --> 00:46:01,051
Take this. Wait five minutes. I'm not kidding.
I'm not kidding. Wait.

655
00:46:01,134 --> 00:46:03,679
What happened? What did I do?

656
00:46:13,272 --> 00:46:14,940
Get in!

657
00:46:15,607 --> 00:46:17,943
- Hey, Lol, wait up!
- Leave me alone.

658
00:46:18,026 --> 00:46:21,488
What did Ashley say to you?
What did she say to you?

659
00:46:21,530 --> 00:46:22,781
- Kyle, don't play dumb.
- No, seriously.

660
00:46:22,864 --> 00:46:24,574
What's wrong? Come on.

661
00:46:24,658 --> 00:46:26,535
- Don't act like you don't know.
- Hey, Lol, what's your deal?

662
00:46:26,618 --> 00:46:30,247
My deal is that everybody knows
she does guys in the bathroom, Kyle.

663
00:46:31,039 --> 00:46:33,709
Wait. What? You think Ashley and I...

664
00:46:34,042 --> 00:46:35,460
In the bathroom?

665
00:46:35,544 --> 00:46:37,379
Well, at least you can get it on
with someone.

666
00:46:37,546 --> 00:46:38,797
Congratulations.

667
00:46:40,549 --> 00:46:43,093
Wow! I guess we're done.

668
00:46:55,522 --> 00:46:56,606
Lola?

669
00:46:59,985 --> 00:47:03,030
Lola? Sweetie, what is it? What's wrong?

670
00:47:04,531 --> 00:47:06,074
Nothing.

671
00:47:06,116 --> 00:47:08,327
Come on, have something to eat.

672
00:47:08,410 --> 00:47:09,745
It's good to eat when you're sad.

673
00:47:10,537 --> 00:47:12,331
What would you like?
What would taste good?

674
00:47:12,414 --> 00:47:14,082
Nothing right now.

675
00:47:15,208 --> 00:47:17,878
You're not going to turn anorexic now,
are you?

676
00:47:18,545 --> 00:47:20,881
Not from skipping one meal.

677
00:47:22,591 --> 00:47:25,927
No, I saw something on TV.
It goes pretty fast.

678
00:47:28,013 --> 00:47:30,807
- It's not what it is.
- I know.

679
00:47:31,767 --> 00:47:34,102
Nobody's worth your tears, baby.

680
00:47:35,854 --> 00:47:37,481
I'm gonna get you some soup.

681
00:47:37,564 --> 00:47:38,815
Okay. I love you.

682
00:48:30,117 --> 00:48:32,828
No, I saw him.
He was in there with the Post-it.

683
00:48:32,911 --> 00:48:33,995
When?

684
00:48:34,037 --> 00:48:36,331
After that drug assembly thing.

685
00:48:36,373 --> 00:48:38,625
Okay, are you absolutely positive
that it was them?

686
00:48:38,667 --> 00:48:41,795
Yes. Yes. I saw that stupid bag.
No offense.

687
00:48:42,796 --> 00:48:44,005
No, it's fine.

688
00:48:44,339 --> 00:48:47,676
Hey, girl! High-five it.
Girl, I'll see you...

689
00:48:49,094 --> 00:48:50,595
Here they are.

690
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:52,806
Shit.

691
00:49:00,605 --> 00:49:02,065
<i>"What's wrong with me?"</i>

692
00:49:02,149 --> 00:49:04,943
<i>"Do I have a sign on my head
that says 'Cheat on me' ?"</i>

693
00:49:05,026 --> 00:49:08,989
<i>"I mean, no surprise
from Ashley, but Kyle?"</i>

694
00:49:09,030 --> 00:49:11,658
<i>"And since bad things come in threes..."</i>

695
00:49:19,374 --> 00:49:21,918
You know what this report smells like?

696
00:49:22,002 --> 00:49:23,086
What?

697
00:49:25,213 --> 00:49:27,799
No more music. Merry Christmas.

698
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,469
Merry Christmas to you, too.

699
00:49:42,898 --> 00:49:45,108
The most important thing
is that you're pretty.

700
00:49:45,442 --> 00:49:46,860
You'll get a rich husband.

701
00:49:48,111 --> 00:49:49,237
Great.

702
00:49:49,446 --> 00:49:51,239
Last year, you were on the honor roll.

703
00:49:51,781 --> 00:49:53,158
Mom, it's only one B.

704
00:49:53,617 --> 00:49:55,619
That's exactly my point.

705
00:49:57,412 --> 00:50:01,666
A B in math, a C in
history, a D in biology?

706
00:50:02,042 --> 00:50:03,585
Lola, what are you thinking?

707
00:50:03,668 --> 00:50:06,087
<i>I'm not thinking anything, Mom.</i>

708
00:50:06,171 --> 00:50:08,965
<i>Because I don't care
about the population of China</i>

709
00:50:09,049 --> 00:50:11,218
<i>or the division of cells.</i>

710
00:50:11,259 --> 00:50:12,594
<i>The only thing I care about,</i>

711
00:50:12,677 --> 00:50:15,805
<i>the only thing that hurts,
is Kyle and the Post-it.</i>

712
00:50:15,889 --> 00:50:18,683
<i>And howl want to hurt them
as much as they hurt me.</i>

713
00:50:25,065 --> 00:50:27,692
So, who's the guy
we're supposed to make jealous?

714
00:50:27,776 --> 00:50:29,027
The emo one next to the slut.

715
00:50:29,611 --> 00:50:31,446
Nice hair. What a dork.

716
00:50:31,696 --> 00:50:34,407
Come on, he's not that bad.
Shut up and make it look sexy.

717
00:50:34,449 --> 00:50:35,784
Okay.

718
00:50:37,244 --> 00:50:39,412
- Like only you can.
- Yeah, it's true.

719
00:50:39,454 --> 00:50:41,456
- No. I'm not talking...
- Who needs a girl?

720
00:50:41,540 --> 00:50:42,666
- Come on.
- Hey, who is that guy?

721
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:46,503
- Who's that guy?
- Jeremy. He's cool. Why?

722
00:50:47,170 --> 00:50:48,338
Nothing.

723
00:50:50,507 --> 00:50:53,009
I mean, who drives a stupid red Vespa
in the middle of winter?

724
00:50:53,093 --> 00:50:55,762
- Why do you care?
- Yeah, why do you care?

725
00:50:55,887 --> 00:50:57,889
I don't care. Come on, let's go.

726
00:51:03,728 --> 00:51:05,021
She de-friended me?

727
00:51:27,711 --> 00:51:28,712
Thank you.

728
00:51:30,255 --> 00:51:32,173
So, how's Jeremy?

729
00:51:32,215 --> 00:51:33,216
How's Ashley?

730
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:34,676
You know I'm not seeing Ashley.

731
00:51:34,801 --> 00:51:36,094
- Can we talk?
- Okay.

732
00:51:36,386 --> 00:51:39,848
No, in private. At your house at 7:00?

733
00:51:39,973 --> 00:51:41,057
Okay.

734
00:51:41,433 --> 00:51:42,684
Okay.

735
00:51:43,602 --> 00:51:45,353
I called you, but you didn't come.

736
00:51:45,437 --> 00:51:46,730
Come on, come here.

737
00:51:46,813 --> 00:51:47,814
Who is it?

738
00:51:47,856 --> 00:51:49,024
It's Ashley.

739
00:51:49,399 --> 00:51:51,026
Why'd you call her over, man?

740
00:51:51,318 --> 00:51:52,652
Hey, boys.

741
00:51:53,778 --> 00:51:55,280
Hey.

742
00:51:55,655 --> 00:51:56,698
Oh, God,

743
00:51:56,781 --> 00:51:59,451
she just always shows up everywhere.

744
00:51:59,534 --> 00:52:01,036
She's like a bad dream.

745
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:03,079
You just can't wake up from it.

746
00:52:03,163 --> 00:52:04,414
Jesus.

747
00:52:05,248 --> 00:52:06,708
<i>I deal with kids every day.</i>

748
00:52:06,791 --> 00:52:08,585
I know the difference
between a kid in trouble

749
00:52:08,668 --> 00:52:09,669
and a kid testing the limits,

750
00:52:09,711 --> 00:52:12,797
and she sounds really normal.

751
00:52:12,881 --> 00:52:13,965
Don't feel guilty.

752
00:52:14,049 --> 00:52:15,842
With kids, it's always guilt.

753
00:52:15,884 --> 00:52:17,385
If I'm too lenient, I'm guilty.

754
00:52:18,178 --> 00:52:21,306
If I yell, it's even worse.

755
00:52:21,473 --> 00:52:23,683
And then it's like I'm
a cop in my own home.

756
00:52:23,892 --> 00:52:25,101
That must be awful.

757
00:52:27,979 --> 00:52:30,065
I keep insulting your profession.

758
00:52:31,941 --> 00:52:34,569
The thing is I'm the one
who is always saying

759
00:52:34,653 --> 00:52:36,404
that a woman should have the same rights

760
00:52:36,446 --> 00:52:39,199
and should be able to enjoy sex
the same way a man does.

761
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:40,617
I couldn't agree more.

762
00:52:41,326 --> 00:52:42,410
You know what I mean.

763
00:52:42,494 --> 00:52:43,620
I know what you mean.

764
00:52:43,703 --> 00:52:46,164
But it's my little girl.

765
00:52:46,247 --> 00:52:50,251
And now that she's starting
to live life as a liberated woman,

766
00:52:50,293 --> 00:52:52,295
I just don't know if I feel the same.

767
00:52:52,587 --> 00:52:54,964
And I don't even know
what to do about Paris.

768
00:52:55,256 --> 00:52:58,343
I am so confused.
I don't even know what to believe.

769
00:52:59,094 --> 00:53:00,679
It's a school trip.

770
00:53:00,804 --> 00:53:03,098
You should let her go to Paris.

771
00:53:07,936 --> 00:53:11,439
Are you saying this to reassure me,
or is that what you really think?

772
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:14,067
I think you think too much.

773
00:53:18,655 --> 00:53:22,701
Hey, Lol, it's me.
I'll be there in 10 minutes. Okay.

774
00:53:29,624 --> 00:53:32,252
- Where do you think you're going?
- To Chad's. Excuse me...

775
00:53:32,293 --> 00:53:36,047
Are you that stupid
that you bring pot into my house?

776
00:53:36,214 --> 00:53:37,632
- Oh, please.
- Oh, please?

777
00:53:37,799 --> 00:53:38,967
Did you say, "Oh, please"?

778
00:53:39,050 --> 00:53:41,302
How about, oh, please,
wave goodbye to all this

779
00:53:41,386 --> 00:53:43,471
'cause next year, it's military school.

780
00:53:43,513 --> 00:53:44,806
Oh, you think that's funny?

781
00:53:44,848 --> 00:53:47,392
- Get your hands off my guitar!
- It's my guitar!

782
00:53:47,475 --> 00:53:50,311
Dad, no! What are you doing?
Are you crazy?

783
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:53,022
No more phone! No more computer!

784
00:53:58,319 --> 00:54:00,905
Hey, Kyle. It's Lola. Remember me?

785
00:54:01,239 --> 00:54:04,117
Whatever. I've been waiting here for an hour.
I'm not an idiot.

786
00:54:04,159 --> 00:54:05,744
Don't ever talk to me again, okay?

787
00:54:15,253 --> 00:54:19,758
Thank you for listening to my meltdown.
It really helped.

788
00:54:20,258 --> 00:54:22,218
It's all part of the job, ma'am.

789
00:54:22,302 --> 00:54:24,429
- It was really nice.
- It was nice.

790
00:54:33,146 --> 00:54:34,397
What are you doing here?

791
00:54:36,065 --> 00:54:38,109
Allen, James...

792
00:54:38,610 --> 00:54:41,029
Allen's the father of my children.

793
00:54:42,197 --> 00:54:43,823
Lola,

794
00:54:46,034 --> 00:54:48,077
she forgot her books in my...

795
00:54:48,161 --> 00:54:50,538
I signed the little
permission slip for Paris.

796
00:54:50,622 --> 00:54:52,665
We needed to talk about that.

797
00:54:52,791 --> 00:54:55,043
Should we talk about this now?

798
00:54:55,126 --> 00:54:56,294
Allen.

799
00:54:56,503 --> 00:54:58,087
That's a nice dress.

800
00:55:03,384 --> 00:55:04,385
Night.

801
00:55:13,102 --> 00:55:14,395
You Okay?

802
00:55:14,562 --> 00:55:15,647
Yeah.

803
00:55:16,981 --> 00:55:19,275
I guess I should let you
feel guilty in peace.

804
00:55:20,485 --> 00:55:22,403
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

805
00:55:30,578 --> 00:55:31,996
Good night.

806
00:55:32,372 --> 00:55:33,748
Good night.

807
00:55:59,190 --> 00:56:00,400
Yummy.

808
00:56:07,448 --> 00:56:09,117
- Oh, my gosh.
- Oh, God. You okay?

809
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:10,660
- Oh, hey.
- Oh, Mr. Ross.

810
00:56:11,035 --> 00:56:13,621
I didn't see you there, I'm sorry.
How are you?

811
00:56:13,830 --> 00:56:16,291
Good, good. Just grocery shopping.

812
00:56:16,624 --> 00:56:18,293
Yeah, me too.

813
00:56:20,211 --> 00:56:21,254
Wow, healthy.

814
00:56:21,462 --> 00:56:22,839
Do you cook a lot?

815
00:56:23,131 --> 00:56:24,257
Yeah, I love to cook.

816
00:56:24,924 --> 00:56:25,967
I love to cook.

817
00:56:26,551 --> 00:56:28,553
I cook all the time.

818
00:56:28,970 --> 00:56:31,890
Emily, did you find the milk?

819
00:56:32,098 --> 00:56:34,475
No, it's not that way.

820
00:56:35,184 --> 00:56:37,812
- But this is my trig teacher, Mr. Ross.
- How are you doing?

821
00:56:37,854 --> 00:56:39,147
- This is my mom.
- Hello.

822
00:56:39,188 --> 00:56:40,857
And my brother.

823
00:56:41,024 --> 00:56:42,191
Hey.

824
00:56:42,483 --> 00:56:46,487
I'm sorry about the home tutoring thing.
I just was already booked up this semester.

825
00:56:46,529 --> 00:56:48,531
Home tutoring for Emily?

826
00:56:48,615 --> 00:56:49,616
Yeah.

827
00:56:51,326 --> 00:56:53,328
No. No, no, sorry.

828
00:56:54,537 --> 00:56:57,165
My fault. I must've gotten her mixed up
with some other student.

829
00:56:57,582 --> 00:57:01,127
Well, teachers should keep their
minds sharpened, shouldn't they? Come on.

830
00:57:01,794 --> 00:57:03,129
- Emily.
- Yeah, no...

831
00:57:03,463 --> 00:57:05,089
Nice meeting you.

832
00:57:05,965 --> 00:57:07,884
Since when do teachers look like that?

833
00:57:08,051 --> 00:57:09,260
Yeah, right?

834
00:57:13,473 --> 00:57:16,100
So, he does his own grocery shopping,
which means he's totally single.

835
00:57:16,225 --> 00:57:18,353
<i>So? You're not going to be
sleeping with your teacher, Em.</i>

836
00:57:18,686 --> 00:57:19,729
Yeah, says who?

837
00:57:22,482 --> 00:57:25,276
Is something wrong with you?
You seem kind of...

838
00:57:25,401 --> 00:57:27,403
I can't quit thinking
about Kyle and Ashley.

839
00:57:34,535 --> 00:57:36,287
Lola, it was me, okay?

840
00:57:36,955 --> 00:57:37,997
It was you what?

841
00:57:38,122 --> 00:57:40,792
<i>It wasn't the Post-it and it wasn't Kyle.
It was me.</i>

842
00:57:40,959 --> 00:57:42,377
In the boys' bathroom.

843
00:57:42,418 --> 00:57:45,129
You didn't see her purse. You saw mine.

844
00:57:47,215 --> 00:57:49,759
- Wait, you and Kyle?
- No!

845
00:57:49,884 --> 00:57:52,929
<i>I want to tell you who, but I can't.
Believe me.</i>

846
00:57:53,012 --> 00:57:56,891
Okay, it was just a onetime thing.
I wanted to just get it over with.

847
00:57:56,975 --> 00:57:59,227
So that I would be ready for Mr. Ross
when he was ready.

848
00:57:59,352 --> 00:58:00,353
<i>You know?</i>

849
00:58:00,395 --> 00:58:01,729
Oh, my God. Are you serious?

850
00:58:01,813 --> 00:58:02,897
I wanted to tell you,

851
00:58:02,939 --> 00:58:05,900
but then you did the whole, like,
"Who does it in the boys' bathroom?"

852
00:58:05,984 --> 00:58:07,151
"She's a ho!"

853
00:58:07,318 --> 00:58:09,237
Me and Kyle broke up because of this.

854
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:10,530
Look, I'm really sorry.

855
00:58:10,571 --> 00:58:13,741
I cannot believe you did that.
I can't talk to you right now. I'm sorry.

856
00:58:17,453 --> 00:58:18,579
Okay.

857
00:58:33,136 --> 00:58:35,847
Wow, you're back early for a change.

858
00:58:36,973 --> 00:58:39,934
Wow, look at you doing homework
for a change.

859
00:58:44,564 --> 00:58:46,107
Answer me.

860
00:59:07,253 --> 00:59:10,548
So, about this trip to Paris?

861
00:59:11,215 --> 00:59:12,467
Yes?

862
00:59:14,385 --> 00:59:16,637
Are all your friends going?

863
00:59:18,222 --> 00:59:19,307
Yes.

864
00:59:22,810 --> 00:59:26,397
And if I were to let you go,
would you promise...

865
00:59:26,481 --> 00:59:28,900
Oh, my God.
I promise, I will be so good, Mom.

866
00:59:28,983 --> 00:59:31,903
Please, please, please, please, Mom.
Please, please.

867
00:59:32,028 --> 00:59:33,654
Is that a yes?

868
00:59:34,697 --> 00:59:36,491
Yes, yes! Thank you so much!

869
00:59:38,659 --> 00:59:41,287
Mom, it's not the jungle. It's Paris.

870
00:59:41,829 --> 00:59:44,540
This is what I gave you
last time for cramps.

871
00:59:44,624 --> 00:59:47,376
Should I write cramps on it?
Think you'll remember?

872
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:49,003
I have a brain.

873
00:59:50,088 --> 00:59:51,255
Good for you, angel.

874
00:59:51,339 --> 00:59:53,633
- I'm gonna go pack.
- Good for you.

875
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:57,178
I found it, sweetie.

876
00:59:57,345 --> 00:59:59,806
Oh, nice. All right, conservative.

877
01:00:01,682 --> 01:00:03,851
What is this? An eye patch?

878
01:00:03,893 --> 01:00:04,894
No, it's Lola's.

879
01:00:04,977 --> 01:00:06,229
She left it here when she spent the night.

880
01:00:06,312 --> 01:00:07,355
I just have to give it back to her.

881
01:00:07,396 --> 01:00:10,149
Oh, really? How many nights
did she spend here? Eighty?

882
01:00:10,441 --> 01:00:11,692
Do you think I'm stupid?

883
01:00:11,776 --> 01:00:13,986
- No, I don't think you're...
- You haven't even left yet,

884
01:00:14,028 --> 01:00:16,030
and if I find any more of these,
you're not going anywhere!

885
01:00:16,405 --> 01:00:19,033
These are for bad girls with bad grades
and no futures!

886
01:00:19,158 --> 01:00:21,160
This is garbage! Garbage!

887
01:00:28,876 --> 01:00:30,670
You promise you're going
to be careful, right?

888
01:00:30,753 --> 01:00:32,088
Why do you keep asking me that?

889
01:00:32,213 --> 01:00:35,883
I really don't feel comfortable with you
staying with a family that I don't know.

890
01:00:35,925 --> 01:00:38,094
Mom, they're French.
They're probably stricter than you.

891
01:00:38,177 --> 01:00:39,178
Okay.

892
01:00:39,220 --> 01:00:43,808
So I have a little something for you,
just to add to your collection.

893
01:00:49,981 --> 01:00:51,983
I love it. Thank you so much.

894
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:53,651
It's so cute. Thank you, Mom.

895
01:00:53,734 --> 01:00:55,278
- You're welcome.
- I love you.

896
01:00:55,945 --> 01:00:57,738
- Let me put it on.
- Yeah.

897
01:00:58,281 --> 01:00:59,282
It's so cute.

898
01:00:59,365 --> 01:01:00,950
You promise, right? To be careful?

899
01:01:01,033 --> 01:01:03,953
- I promise. Stop asking.
- Okay.

900
01:01:04,203 --> 01:01:05,538
- No, no.
- What?

901
01:01:05,580 --> 01:01:06,622
- No. No.
- Mom!

902
01:01:06,747 --> 01:01:07,915
Mom, I don't have any warm sweaters.

903
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:09,667
You have a ton.

904
01:01:09,750 --> 01:01:11,544
They're all scratchy. This one is soft.

905
01:01:11,586 --> 01:01:13,504
Yeah, well, six-ply cashmere, it better be.

906
01:01:13,588 --> 01:01:15,923
- Mom, please. Please, Mommy.
- No. No.

907
01:01:16,007 --> 01:01:18,217
Mommy, I'm going to be cold,
and when I wear it, I'll think of you

908
01:01:18,259 --> 01:01:20,011
and how much you love me
and how much I love you

909
01:01:20,094 --> 01:01:21,512
and how much I miss you, Mom. Please.

910
01:01:21,596 --> 01:01:23,848
Please. It's my favorite...

911
01:01:23,931 --> 01:01:27,018
You are such a pain in the ass.

912
01:01:27,518 --> 01:01:28,728
Unbelievable.

913
01:01:28,769 --> 01:01:31,022
- Do not stretch this out.
- I won't.

914
01:01:46,037 --> 01:01:48,164
I'm gonna get some water.
Do you want some?

915
01:01:48,247 --> 01:01:50,208
I'm good, thank you.

916
01:01:51,209 --> 01:01:52,710
Are we cool, Lola?

917
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:54,629
Yeah, we're cool.

918
01:01:55,296 --> 01:01:57,089
Look, I can just go talk
to him right now, okay?

919
01:01:57,131 --> 01:01:58,424
It's fine.

920
01:02:00,092 --> 01:02:02,595
All right. I'm gonna get some water.

921
01:02:03,638 --> 01:02:04,847
Hey, what's the matter?

922
01:02:04,972 --> 01:02:07,600
She's still mad at me. I'm getting water.

923
01:02:33,167 --> 01:02:34,168
Hey.

924
01:03:15,293 --> 01:03:17,753
Mrs. Chandler, where are we?
This is terrible.

925
01:03:20,047 --> 01:03:24,176
Come on, we're here.
There are your families.

926
01:03:27,054 --> 01:03:28,431
Come on. Get down quickly, girls!

927
01:03:28,514 --> 01:03:30,224
Okay, where is the Eiffel Tower?

928
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:33,936
- Oh, my God.
- Is that sheep?

929
01:03:34,395 --> 01:03:36,105
Mrs. Chandler, can I go home?

930
01:03:36,188 --> 01:03:38,733
When you said we were going to Paris,
what did you mean?

931
01:03:38,816 --> 01:03:41,819
We're only 20 minutes away. Okay?

932
01:03:47,450 --> 01:03:50,661
This is a way to say hello.
It's a French hello.

933
01:03:52,538 --> 01:03:53,748
What's up?

934
01:03:54,999 --> 01:03:57,960
Dude, I've seen this in a horror film.
It does not end well.

935
01:03:58,044 --> 01:04:00,129
- We got to get out of here.
- Don't discriminate, bro.

936
01:04:00,212 --> 01:04:03,090
Discriminate? Are you kidding me?
Don't say that to me.

937
01:04:05,926 --> 01:04:08,429
Oh, my God. I need a hotel now.

938
01:04:50,846 --> 01:04:51,972
Hello.

939
01:05:14,537 --> 01:05:15,746
It's nice here.

940
01:05:15,830 --> 01:05:18,040
Welcome to the psych ward.

941
01:05:19,208 --> 01:05:21,001
Okay, Mom, I gotta go.

942
01:05:21,085 --> 01:05:24,255
My battery's about to die
and I got to find an adapter, okay?

943
01:05:24,338 --> 01:05:25,506
They don't have one.

944
01:05:26,632 --> 01:05:28,426
This family is so weird.

945
01:05:28,801 --> 01:05:30,719
- Love you.
- Okay, bye.

946
01:05:31,053 --> 01:05:32,847
She said her family is weird.

947
01:05:32,972 --> 01:05:34,306
I knew that I shouldn't let her go.

948
01:05:34,348 --> 01:05:36,725
- Why are they weird?
- They're not weird. They're French.

949
01:05:36,809 --> 01:05:39,228
And how could I forget
to send her with an adapter?

950
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:41,522
Well, you've given her life, that's enough.

951
01:05:41,856 --> 01:05:44,191
- You know what? I have to go.
- Where are you going?

952
01:05:44,316 --> 01:05:46,485
You know what?
Do you guys have homework?

953
01:05:46,527 --> 01:05:48,654
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I thought so. Let's get on it.

954
01:05:50,489 --> 01:05:51,866
So, do you like him?

955
01:05:52,199 --> 01:05:53,617
- Who?
- Who?

956
01:05:54,034 --> 01:05:56,912
- Starsky.
- Mom, would you not call him that?

957
01:05:56,996 --> 01:05:58,122
And I haven't even thought about it.

958
01:05:58,956 --> 01:06:00,791
Don't bullshit me, dear.

959
01:06:00,875 --> 01:06:02,376
I haven't. Really.

960
01:06:02,501 --> 01:06:05,504
I just hate it when everyone
acts like your life is over

961
01:06:05,546 --> 01:06:06,755
if you don't have a man.

962
01:06:06,964 --> 01:06:09,091
There's nothing wrong with
getting back on the horse, you know.

963
01:06:09,300 --> 01:06:10,551
So, where is he taking you?

964
01:06:10,634 --> 01:06:13,554
Mom, would you quit asking me questions?

965
01:06:13,762 --> 01:06:15,806
You don't have to know everything.

966
01:06:16,182 --> 01:06:17,224
How do I look?

967
01:06:18,058 --> 01:06:19,894
You look adorable.

968
01:06:21,437 --> 01:06:23,189
Now, don't forget to take a sweater

969
01:06:23,772 --> 01:06:25,691
and other things to protect yourself.

970
01:06:26,442 --> 01:06:27,902
- Mom!
- I mean it.

971
01:06:28,235 --> 01:06:30,196
She's like Mom with Lola.

972
01:06:30,404 --> 01:06:32,990
Hey, come on. What about that homework?

973
01:06:33,073 --> 01:06:35,159
Let's get on it, chop, chop, chop.

974
01:06:35,242 --> 01:06:36,410
Have fun.

975
01:06:44,877 --> 01:06:46,504
That thing is so creepy.

976
01:06:47,296 --> 01:06:50,633
- Oh, my God, it is so cold in here.
- I know.

977
01:06:51,300 --> 01:06:53,552
What? French people don't have heat?

978
01:06:54,053 --> 01:06:57,431
- No, it's just these creepy Joan of Arc fans.
- Why?

979
01:06:58,098 --> 01:06:59,683
Because she was burned at the stake!

980
01:07:06,815 --> 01:07:08,776
Lola, why are you still mad at me?

981
01:07:09,235 --> 01:07:10,819
Because I would never do to you
what you did to me.

982
01:07:10,945 --> 01:07:12,613
Yeah, but you don't really even
know what happened,

983
01:07:12,696 --> 01:07:13,906
and if you knew, you would not be upset.

984
01:07:13,948 --> 01:07:15,324
'Cause you won't tell me!

985
01:07:18,077 --> 01:07:20,204
Okay, but if I tell you,

986
01:07:20,287 --> 01:07:23,541
do you promise that you won't tell anybody
and you won't laugh at me?

987
01:07:24,166 --> 01:07:25,167
Promise.

988
01:07:25,793 --> 01:07:28,462
- You swear? Okay.
- Swear! Come on.

989
01:07:31,715 --> 01:07:33,300
- What?
- Oh, God!

990
01:07:33,384 --> 01:07:35,344
- Come on, tell me.
- Oh, my God! I can't.

991
01:07:36,804 --> 01:07:37,805
It was Wen.

992
01:07:38,222 --> 01:07:40,641
You said you wouldn't laugh!

993
01:07:40,766 --> 01:07:43,561
- You said you wouldn't laugh.
- Okay, I get why you lied.

994
01:09:31,752 --> 01:09:34,880
So, James, what do you do for a living?

995
01:09:35,422 --> 01:09:36,632
I'm a cop.

996
01:09:37,549 --> 01:09:39,718
- Narcotics.
- Take that.

997
01:09:41,261 --> 01:09:44,098
Just breathe. Take it easy.

998
01:09:44,139 --> 01:09:46,183
I only smoke because of my sciatica.

999
01:09:46,767 --> 01:09:48,686
- Sciatica?
- He is so full of it.

1000
01:09:48,769 --> 01:09:50,729
- No, I'm not.
- No, sweetheart, it's okay.

1001
01:09:50,813 --> 01:09:53,190
He's a cop!

1002
01:10:14,586 --> 01:10:15,587
Stop.

1003
01:10:20,759 --> 01:10:22,302
No, no, no, no.

1004
01:10:38,277 --> 01:10:39,278
Okay.

1005
01:10:40,112 --> 01:10:41,113
Lola?

1006
01:10:44,366 --> 01:10:45,367
Lola?

1007
01:10:47,244 --> 01:10:48,746
Oh, my God!

1008
01:10:51,206 --> 01:10:53,208
You're a genius. Nice muscles.

1009
01:11:36,418 --> 01:11:37,419
We're going to go to bed.

1010
01:11:38,712 --> 01:11:41,548
- Thanks, man. You're great.
- Screw you. This is the second time.

1011
01:11:48,806 --> 01:11:49,890
Deaf-mute.

1012
01:11:53,769 --> 01:11:57,689
- Why is it so complicated in Chicago?
- I don't know.

1013
01:11:59,733 --> 01:12:01,693
It's not complicated here.

1014
01:12:06,615 --> 01:12:08,909
- Hey, Lol.
- Yeah?

1015
01:12:09,743 --> 01:12:12,079
Can you do me a favor?

1016
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:15,082
Can you keep my guitar back in Chicago?

1017
01:12:15,999 --> 01:12:17,709
You're the only person I can trust.

1018
01:12:19,211 --> 01:12:20,212
Sure.

1019
01:12:30,597 --> 01:12:33,433
- Can I tell you something?
- What?

1020
01:12:34,768 --> 01:12:36,395
It's actually my first time.

1021
01:12:57,624 --> 01:13:01,044
It's my first time since my divorce.

1022
01:13:56,433 --> 01:13:59,311
<i>It's so good to love someone
so much it hurts.</i>

1023
01:13:59,978 --> 01:14:02,439
<i>I don't know how people survive this.</i>

1024
01:14:02,522 --> 01:14:04,483
<i>Honestly, I don't.</i>

1025
01:14:32,886 --> 01:14:34,972
- Hey.
- Hey, what's up?

1026
01:14:35,764 --> 01:14:38,600
How did it go? I want the scoop.

1027
01:14:39,101 --> 01:14:40,936
- What scoop?
- On Paris.

1028
01:14:42,062 --> 01:14:43,730
It was cool.

1029
01:14:45,315 --> 01:14:46,942
Okay, well, what did you do?

1030
01:14:47,859 --> 01:14:51,822
School stuff. It was like, the
Eiffel Tower, which is beautiful.

1031
01:14:52,364 --> 01:14:54,574
And learned some French.
It was nothing special.

1032
01:14:55,409 --> 01:14:56,410
What about you?

1033
01:14:56,785 --> 01:14:58,328
- Me?
- Yeah, what did you do?

1034
01:14:59,913 --> 01:15:03,583
Really nothing special.

1035
01:15:13,135 --> 01:15:14,428
Okay, are you scared?

1036
01:15:14,469 --> 01:15:17,305
Well, if he kisses you on the lips,
it means he's cool being your boyfriend.

1037
01:15:17,389 --> 01:15:18,849
If not, forget it.

1038
01:15:20,726 --> 01:15:22,102
Hey.

1039
01:15:23,937 --> 01:15:25,480
What are you doing?

1040
01:15:26,982 --> 01:15:28,525
Okay, yeah.

1041
01:15:28,942 --> 01:15:30,694
- Okay. No. Come on.
- I love you.

1042
01:15:32,863 --> 01:15:34,573
<i>So, is your old man
going to let you play the gig?</i>

1043
01:15:34,614 --> 01:15:36,616
Or are we going to have to tunnel you out?

1044
01:15:36,783 --> 01:15:38,618
Are you kidding?
There's no way I'm going to let my dad ruin

1045
01:15:38,660 --> 01:15:39,786
our chance at getting signed.

1046
01:15:39,828 --> 01:15:41,288
This is huge, right?

1047
01:15:41,371 --> 01:15:44,041
I mean, it's like the biggest chance
we have, dude.

1048
01:15:45,459 --> 01:15:46,960
Maybe your parents could adopt me.

1049
01:15:47,085 --> 01:15:49,421
Yeah, but then my brother

1050
01:15:49,463 --> 01:15:51,715
could be hooking up with my ex-girlfriend
in my own house.

1051
01:15:55,469 --> 01:15:57,471
Look, man, about that.

1052
01:15:57,512 --> 01:15:59,723
- You just got to get over it.
- It's cool.

1053
01:16:00,932 --> 01:16:05,145
Look, just keep it real with me,
and we'll be cool.

1054
01:16:06,021 --> 01:16:07,689
I mean, we're like brothers, right?

1055
01:16:26,124 --> 01:16:27,626
This is so awesome.

1056
01:16:28,085 --> 01:16:29,169
You're a sociopath.

1057
01:16:29,628 --> 01:16:31,755
Okay, no, I'm not doing this.

1058
01:16:31,838 --> 01:16:33,882
How many pigs had to die for this class?

1059
01:16:34,549 --> 01:16:35,550
Where's PETA?

1060
01:16:35,842 --> 01:16:37,552
What do you think
they test all your ho makeup on?

1061
01:16:38,178 --> 01:16:40,680
Stop calling every girl a ho.
It's getting old, okay?

1062
01:16:40,722 --> 01:16:42,641
- Yeah, whatever, ho.
- Thank you.

1063
01:16:43,350 --> 01:16:44,351
Welcome.

1064
01:16:44,684 --> 01:16:45,852
Yeah, it comes from the heart.

1065
01:16:45,936 --> 01:16:48,021
- Oh, my God.
- That is so gross!

1066
01:16:48,897 --> 01:16:50,690
Kyle, stop!

1067
01:16:52,526 --> 01:16:54,569
Are you kidding me
with this room right now, Lola?

1068
01:16:54,820 --> 01:16:56,196
It is a pigsty.

1069
01:16:56,238 --> 01:16:57,364
<i>All right, will you get out of my stuff?</i>

1070
01:16:57,447 --> 01:16:58,907
<i>You're never going to find
anything in there anyway.</i>

1071
01:16:58,990 --> 01:17:01,785
Well, if I can't find my sweater, then
you're losing your computer for a month.

1072
01:17:01,868 --> 01:17:03,662
<i>All right. Love you, Mom, love you, Mom.</i>

1073
01:17:17,717 --> 01:17:19,761
<i>"Emily's lie totally worked,"</i>

1074
01:17:20,011 --> 01:17:23,056
<i>"and I finally got to have sex with Kyle.
Sex with Kyle. "</i>

1075
01:17:45,912 --> 01:17:48,874
This is the worst thing
you can do to your child, isn't it?

1076
01:17:48,915 --> 01:17:50,542
To betray their secrets.

1077
01:17:51,084 --> 01:17:52,711
I feel terrible.

1078
01:17:53,420 --> 01:17:54,713
So tell her.

1079
01:17:55,547 --> 01:17:56,965
- What?
- All of it.

1080
01:17:57,632 --> 01:18:00,594
That you found her diary.
That you know everything. Tell her.

1081
01:18:01,094 --> 01:18:03,305
But she would never forgive me.

1082
01:18:25,118 --> 01:18:26,119
Hello.

1083
01:18:30,457 --> 01:18:33,168
So, you wanted to talk?

1084
01:18:33,835 --> 01:18:34,961
I'm listening.

1085
01:18:35,253 --> 01:18:36,796
Yes, I want to talk about Lola.

1086
01:18:37,130 --> 01:18:38,548
Did you order?

1087
01:18:39,299 --> 01:18:40,800
Don't you start.

1088
01:18:41,635 --> 01:18:43,011
- What?
- I have a therapist

1089
01:18:43,094 --> 01:18:44,679
who says... and it drives me crazy.

1090
01:18:49,935 --> 01:18:51,436
Did you tell her how you're doing someone?

1091
01:18:52,479 --> 01:18:54,189
I am not doing anyone.

1092
01:18:54,272 --> 01:18:56,483
Oh, I'm sorry, yes. You're right.

1093
01:18:56,566 --> 01:18:58,318
It's men who do sluts.

1094
01:18:58,985 --> 01:19:03,531
You women are always making love
to incredible gentlemen.

1095
01:19:03,823 --> 01:19:06,034
Just stop it. This is really not the time.

1096
01:19:06,326 --> 01:19:08,203
This is a great time for me.

1097
01:19:09,162 --> 01:19:11,873
But I forgot I'm speaking
with Miss Moral High Ground.

1098
01:19:13,333 --> 01:19:14,376
Lola's doing drugs.

1099
01:19:15,669 --> 01:19:16,670
She's smoking pot.

1100
01:19:17,128 --> 01:19:18,421
She's a mess right now.

1101
01:19:18,505 --> 01:19:19,506
Well.

1102
01:19:20,507 --> 01:19:21,675
You are her role model.

1103
01:19:22,842 --> 01:19:23,843
Yeah.

1104
01:19:24,386 --> 01:19:26,721
When she hears about your new sex life,
I can't wait for that.

1105
01:19:29,182 --> 01:19:31,434
- Hey.
- You're an idiot. An absolute idiot.

1106
01:19:31,559 --> 01:19:32,560
Hey...

1107
01:19:41,653 --> 01:19:42,988
I'll see you later.

1108
01:19:44,197 --> 01:19:45,198
Come on, let's go!

1109
01:19:45,657 --> 01:19:47,701
- I gotta go.
- Now. We're gonna be late.

1110
01:19:52,539 --> 01:19:54,124
- Hello, Anne.
- Hi.

1111
01:19:55,875 --> 01:19:57,544
- Love you.
- Okay.

1112
01:19:59,379 --> 01:20:00,380
That was cold.

1113
01:20:01,089 --> 01:20:03,133
Well, I'm not crazy about you
hanging outwith that girl.

1114
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:06,720
That girl is my best friend. I'll hang
outwith her if I want to. It's my life.

1115
01:20:07,345 --> 01:20:08,888
- What?
- It's my life.

1116
01:20:08,972 --> 01:20:10,890
You're my daughter, my responsibility.

1117
01:20:10,932 --> 01:20:13,560
And until you turn 18, there's a few things
that I won't tolerate.

1118
01:20:13,643 --> 01:20:15,645
- Really, like what?
- Like messing up your life.

1119
01:20:15,729 --> 01:20:16,855
I'm not messing up my life.

1120
01:20:16,896 --> 01:20:19,649
Smoking pot, drinking alcohol,
sleeping around.

1121
01:20:19,733 --> 01:20:21,276
- What do you call that?
- Where'd you get that?

1122
01:20:23,862 --> 01:20:25,238
I read your diary, okay?

1123
01:20:25,739 --> 01:20:27,824
- What? What?
- It was an accident.

1124
01:20:27,907 --> 01:20:29,617
I was looking for my
sweater and it fell out...

1125
01:20:29,701 --> 01:20:31,369
That is not an accident! It did not fall!

1126
01:20:31,411 --> 01:20:32,454
It was hidden, Mom!

1127
01:20:32,537 --> 01:20:33,997
Well, at least we now know
we're on the same page.

1128
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:35,749
Yeah, you're a liar! Are you kidding?

1129
01:20:35,999 --> 01:20:37,500
You had no right to do that!

1130
01:20:37,792 --> 01:20:39,336
That is my private stuff!

1131
01:20:39,586 --> 01:20:40,712
God, you're a bitch!

1132
01:20:47,344 --> 01:20:50,055
Lola! Lola!

1133
01:20:52,474 --> 01:20:54,309
Lola!

1134
01:20:59,439 --> 01:21:00,940
Lola!

1135
01:21:00,982 --> 01:21:02,525
This house needs a man.

1136
01:21:02,942 --> 01:21:05,236
- What about me?
- Oh, sweetie.

1137
01:21:05,528 --> 01:21:07,238
We just need to talk.

1138
01:21:08,698 --> 01:21:12,285
- Where are you going?
- To Dad's! Do you mind?

1139
01:21:14,746 --> 01:21:16,623
No, not at all.
I'll even be happy to drive you...

1140
01:21:16,706 --> 01:21:17,957
No! I got it.

1141
01:21:18,792 --> 01:21:19,793
Bye.

1142
01:21:24,631 --> 01:21:25,632
Come here.

1143
01:21:27,509 --> 01:21:31,805
My baby. I know. I know, sweetheart.

1144
01:21:32,138 --> 01:21:34,307
It'll be okay. She'll come back.

1145
01:21:36,101 --> 01:21:38,978
- I was never that bad, was I?
- Well, sometimes you were.

1146
01:21:50,824 --> 01:21:52,700
I'm putting garlic in the sauce.

1147
01:21:54,244 --> 01:21:55,245
No.

1148
01:21:57,664 --> 01:21:58,665
Yes!

1149
01:22:01,126 --> 01:22:03,336
- Emily, it's dinner!
- I'm coming!

1150
01:22:09,717 --> 01:22:12,011
Is the image of the J-F-K triangle

1151
01:22:12,178 --> 01:22:14,347
by translation of vector I-D,

1152
01:22:14,722 --> 01:22:17,350
the E-A-F triangle or the E-F-J triangle?

1153
01:22:18,059 --> 01:22:19,853
- Okay. Yes?
- Wen?

1154
01:22:20,228 --> 01:22:22,105
You do know what a vector is, right?

1155
01:22:22,480 --> 01:22:24,691
Yeah, like Hannibal Vector?

1156
01:22:25,817 --> 01:22:28,236
Cute. Look. Are you texting?

1157
01:22:28,403 --> 01:22:29,863
What are you doing? I
wasn't even on that...

1158
01:22:29,904 --> 01:22:31,531
Okay. I need you to focus on this.

1159
01:22:31,573 --> 01:22:33,366
I told you what a vector is.
You asked what a vector is.

1160
01:22:33,450 --> 01:22:34,951
I told you what it is.

1161
01:22:43,668 --> 01:22:45,003
Hey,

1162
01:22:45,044 --> 01:22:49,132
I didn't get a chance to thank you
for covering for me at the supermarket.

1163
01:22:49,549 --> 01:22:51,384
Emily, there's no need to thank me.

1164
01:22:52,886 --> 01:22:57,056
But, Emily, you are a beautiful girl,
and you're also a smart girl.

1165
01:22:57,474 --> 01:23:01,853
And smart girls don't need lies and tricks
to get what they want out of life.

1166
01:23:02,437 --> 01:23:03,438
You know what I'm saying?

1167
01:23:04,731 --> 01:23:08,026
Yeah, totally. Okay.

1168
01:23:08,359 --> 01:23:10,945
And also, Wen is very nice.
He's a good kid.

1169
01:23:11,029 --> 01:23:15,033
But maybe you could inspire him to focus
a little bit more on his schoolwork.

1170
01:23:16,367 --> 01:23:18,870
- Okay.
- And also the picture on his cell phone.

1171
01:23:19,078 --> 01:23:20,246
Get him to change it.

1172
01:23:21,873 --> 01:23:23,124
Yeah. Okay.

1173
01:23:23,833 --> 01:23:26,419
Yeah, I'm gonna... I'll do that.
Okay. Good-bye.

1174
01:23:36,095 --> 01:23:38,932
I caught you. You just ate some cream.

1175
01:23:39,307 --> 01:23:41,267
- I did.
- I'm going to eat some chocolate.

1176
01:23:41,309 --> 01:23:43,186
This doesn't make it my favorite.

1177
01:23:48,107 --> 01:23:50,276
See, I like the cream the best.

1178
01:23:50,944 --> 01:23:52,111
I like the chocolate.

1179
01:23:52,529 --> 01:23:54,989
Yeah, you're just like your mother.

1180
01:23:59,786 --> 01:24:01,454
Complicated?

1181
01:24:01,955 --> 01:24:03,081
Very.

1182
01:24:10,755 --> 01:24:13,675
<i>"Dear Mom, I'm sorry
if what you read in my journal"</i>

1183
01:24:13,758 --> 01:24:15,718
<i>"made you feel differently about me,"</i>

1184
01:24:15,802 --> 01:24:19,597
<i>"but the truth is,
I wanted to tell you everything in there,"</i>

1185
01:24:19,639 --> 01:24:21,975
<i>"but I was scared."</i>

1186
01:24:22,767 --> 01:24:26,271
<i>"Scared of what you'd think of me,
and scared that you'd blame yourself;"</i>

1187
01:24:26,479 --> 01:24:27,981
<i>"which you shouldn't."</i>

1188
01:24:28,815 --> 01:24:32,569
<i>"I know I've been a real handful this year.
And I haven't appreciated your love."</i>

1189
01:24:34,737 --> 01:24:38,241
<i>"Since I left, I'm not
crying because I'm sad."</i>

1190
01:24:38,825 --> 01:24:42,245
<i>"It's because I made you sad,
and you so don't deserve it."</i>

1191
01:24:43,413 --> 01:24:45,373
<i>"I know we 're both
just coming from our own sides,"</i>

1192
01:24:45,456 --> 01:24:48,710
<i>"but maybe we could meet in the middle."</i>

1193
01:24:48,793 --> 01:24:50,837
<i>"I miss you so much it hurts."</i>

1194
01:24:51,170 --> 01:24:52,839
<i>"Love, Lola. "</i>

1195
01:25:44,807 --> 01:25:47,435
- I missed you so much.
- Missed you, too.

1196
01:25:52,732 --> 01:25:56,944
- Sorry.
- It's okay. I'm sorry, too.

1197
01:26:03,743 --> 01:26:05,620
Battle of the Bands.

1198
01:26:07,330 --> 01:26:08,998
Check it out.

1199
01:26:10,249 --> 01:26:13,586
- Battle of the Bands. Finals.
- Battle of the Bands.

1200
01:26:15,672 --> 01:26:18,049
- I'm out.
- That was quick.

1201
01:26:19,050 --> 01:26:22,011
I don't know. If I go home before the show,
my dad won't let me out.

1202
01:26:22,136 --> 01:26:23,888
Wait, you said you had this taken care of.

1203
01:26:25,056 --> 01:26:27,141
You got to figure out something
and we can't go to my house.

1204
01:26:27,725 --> 01:26:29,352
Okay, well, you guys figure it out
and let me know,

1205
01:26:29,435 --> 01:26:30,520
but I got to go change.

1206
01:26:31,979 --> 01:26:33,356
Got to do something.

1207
01:26:33,815 --> 01:26:35,108
- For you?
- Hit me.

1208
01:26:35,191 --> 01:26:37,777
Mom? Can I ask you a favor?

1209
01:26:37,819 --> 01:26:40,446
Already? Yes?

1210
01:26:40,780 --> 01:26:44,992
It's like... You would be
the best mom in the whole, wide world.

1211
01:26:45,076 --> 01:26:46,619
- What do you want?
- I just have a few friends

1212
01:26:46,703 --> 01:26:48,621
that need to do band practice. Come here!

1213
01:26:49,247 --> 01:26:50,998
This is Kyle. You remember Kyle, right?

1214
01:26:51,082 --> 01:26:52,959
- Yes. Hi.
- Nice to meet you again.

1215
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:54,627
He has this show thing.
You're the best. Bye!

1216
01:26:54,711 --> 01:26:56,129
- Thank you.
- Hi!

1217
01:27:02,719 --> 01:27:03,970
You're the best mom in the world.

1218
01:27:06,973 --> 01:27:07,974
Kyle!

1219
01:27:12,311 --> 01:27:13,813
That's it. He's done.

1220
01:28:33,518 --> 01:28:34,811
<i>We have our results,</i>

1221
01:28:34,894 --> 01:28:37,814
<i>and the winner of the Battle of the Bands
is No Shampoo!</i>

1222
01:28:38,439 --> 01:28:40,149
Let's have them sing another song!

1223
01:28:46,239 --> 01:28:47,240
<i>Thank you!</i>

1224
01:28:53,287 --> 01:28:55,414
<i>This song is for someone
who means a lot to me.</i>

1225
01:30:36,098 --> 01:30:38,309
<i>I guess if I've learned anything this year,</i>

1226
01:30:38,559 --> 01:30:41,520
<i>it's that you can pretend to be
anyone you want.</i>

1227
01:30:41,562 --> 01:30:43,648
<i>But when it comes to love,</i>

1228
01:30:43,940 --> 01:30:45,149
<i>I mean real love,</i>

1229
01:30:45,900 --> 01:30:49,445
<i>the best thing is just be yourself.</i>

1230
01:31:12,385 --> 01:31:15,221
<i>Truth is, me and Mom aren't so different.</i>

1231
01:31:16,889 --> 01:31:20,643
<i>After all this, we 're finally ready
to let each other grow up.</i>

1232
01:31:20,726 --> 01:31:23,437
<i>And it's nice to know,
no matter what happens,</i>

1233
01:31:24,146 --> 01:31:25,898
<i>we'll always be there for each other.</i>
