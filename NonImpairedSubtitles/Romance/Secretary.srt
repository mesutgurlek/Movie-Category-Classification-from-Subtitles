1
00:03:05,932 --> 00:03:10,936
I got out of the institution on
the day of my sister's wedding.

2
00:03:10,971 --> 00:03:13,769
I'd started to get used
to the place...

3
00:03:13,807 --> 00:03:20,343
breakfast at 8:00, classes at 2:00,
therapy at 4:00 and asleep by 10:00.

4
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,371
You can call me anytime, Lee.

5
00:03:22,415 --> 00:03:25,851
I will always try
and be of heIp to you.

6
00:03:25,886 --> 00:03:28,116
Inside, life was simple.

7
00:03:28,154 --> 00:03:30,145
Thank you, Dr. Twardon.

8
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:33,421
For that reason,
I was reluctant to go.

9
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:35,451
Bon voyage.

10
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:06,748
Come on kiss her, kiss her.

11
00:04:08,228 --> 00:04:10,890
Give her a big wet kiss...

12
00:04:10,931 --> 00:04:13,729
Save some for the honeymoon.

13
00:04:22,042 --> 00:04:24,033
Hi, Peter.

14
00:04:24,077 --> 00:04:27,877
Peter, yeah, who you
almost successfully forgot.

15
00:04:27,914 --> 00:04:29,905
No, I did not.

16
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:32,043
Are you happy to be home?

17
00:04:33,887 --> 00:04:37,050
I mean, are you happy
to be home?

18
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:40,059
How did you know?

19
00:04:41,728 --> 00:04:44,356
I know what you mean.

20
00:04:58,445 --> 00:05:01,141
Here's a little something
for the lovebirds.

21
00:05:04,718 --> 00:05:07,778
You Iook so beautiful.

22
00:05:07,821 --> 00:05:10,483
Thanks, Dad.

23
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:14,491
I thought you stopped.

24
00:05:18,198 --> 00:05:20,996
Do you know how much
we missed you, pumpkin?

25
00:05:21,034 --> 00:05:23,594
I missed you too.

26
00:05:28,908 --> 00:05:31,172
You know what?

27
00:05:31,211 --> 00:05:33,702
I don't feel so good.

28
00:05:33,747 --> 00:05:36,739
Let's go sit down.

29
00:07:27,727 --> 00:07:30,252
You want to talk to me
like a chiId.

30
00:07:30,296 --> 00:07:32,856
I'm not a child!
Think I don't know what I'm doing?

31
00:07:32,899 --> 00:07:36,528
You act like a child!
You don't act like a man.

32
00:07:36,569 --> 00:07:38,901
You've been fired!

33
00:07:38,938 --> 00:07:40,929
Well, I'm glad I'm fired.

34
00:07:40,974 --> 00:07:43,374
I'm glad I'm fired.
Boy, I hated that job.

35
00:07:43,409 --> 00:07:45,900
I don't care that you hated it.
You're drunk!

36
00:07:45,945 --> 00:07:48,846
I'm not drunk. Why do you...
why do you... I'm not drunk!

37
00:07:48,882 --> 00:07:50,873
Why do you always say that?

38
00:07:50,917 --> 00:07:53,181
Get off my fucking back!

39
00:08:05,865 --> 00:08:09,323
Watch this.
Watch this, huh?

40
00:09:13,233 --> 00:09:16,430
Avoid the temptation

41
00:09:16,469 --> 00:09:18,960
of placing your fingers
on the home keys by sight.

42
00:09:19,005 --> 00:09:23,465
Strike each key so that your
fingers bounce with each stroke.

43
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:25,735
Do not strike without thinking.

44
00:09:25,778 --> 00:09:30,078
Do not even attempt to steaI
a gIance at your paper.

45
00:09:30,116 --> 00:09:33,313
'My flowers had just about
given up in despair,

46
00:09:33,353 --> 00:09:36,322
so with the exception of a few
potted pIants from the florist,

47
00:09:36,356 --> 00:09:39,382
we're flowerIess
for the first spring in years.'

48
00:09:39,425 --> 00:09:41,416
And... time.

49
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:46,960
I'm so proud of you, honey...

50
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,332
being out in the world like this.

51
00:09:52,906 --> 00:09:54,897
When my accident happened

52
00:09:54,941 --> 00:10:00,641
we were in the kitchen
and my back was to her.

53
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:05,148
Upstairs, my dad was just leaving
for work at Havis Department Store.

54
00:10:05,184 --> 00:10:07,414
Because there was
a limited amount of time

55
00:10:07,453 --> 00:10:10,183
that my mom's
back was turned...

56
00:10:10,223 --> 00:10:13,021
Lee!
- I slipped and cut too deep.

57
00:10:13,059 --> 00:10:16,426
I'm not sure how
I could have misjudged.

58
00:10:16,462 --> 00:10:20,125
I've been doing it
since 7th grade.

59
00:10:36,649 --> 00:10:39,311
Just a precaution.

60
00:11:25,732 --> 00:11:28,633
'Be a leader.'

61
00:11:37,043 --> 00:11:41,343
I have never
had a job before.

62
00:11:41,381 --> 00:11:43,372
But I can assure you

63
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:46,249
that I am very excited
about this opportunity.

64
00:11:46,285 --> 00:11:48,879
Thank you.

65
00:11:48,921 --> 00:11:54,126
Oh... well...
I don't have any references yet.

66
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,027
But I think that
the Municipal Tax Office

67
00:11:57,063 --> 00:11:59,998
would be a wonderful place...

68
00:12:00,033 --> 00:12:03,628
to begin...

69
00:12:03,669 --> 00:12:05,660
my career.

70
00:12:15,581 --> 00:12:18,345
'Secretary.'

71
00:13:33,025 --> 00:13:35,858
Hello, I...

72
00:13:36,562 --> 00:13:39,156
Wait. I...

73
00:13:55,548 --> 00:13:57,709
Hello?

74
00:14:03,156 --> 00:14:05,181
Hello?

75
00:14:07,093 --> 00:14:09,084
In here.

76
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:19,161
Hi.

77
00:14:22,308 --> 00:14:24,299
Hi.

78
00:14:25,511 --> 00:14:27,502
Are you the lawyer?

79
00:14:31,684 --> 00:14:34,517
Yes.

80
00:14:34,554 --> 00:14:38,285
I'm sorry, I'll come back later.
- No.

81
00:14:39,425 --> 00:14:41,916
No, stay.

82
00:14:59,078 --> 00:15:01,512
It said, 'secretary.'

83
00:15:03,983 --> 00:15:06,474
That's right.

84
00:15:10,256 --> 00:15:12,850
Are you pregnant?

85
00:15:14,827 --> 00:15:16,818
No.

86
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:20,563
Do you plan on getting pregnant?

87
00:15:24,537 --> 00:15:27,062
No.

88
00:15:27,206 --> 00:15:29,697
Are you living in an apartment?
- A house.

89
00:15:29,742 --> 00:15:32,905
Alone?
- With my parents.

90
00:15:32,945 --> 00:15:35,038
Siblings?

91
00:15:36,048 --> 00:15:38,516
My sister is going
to live in the backyard,

92
00:15:38,551 --> 00:15:40,883
with her husband,
in the pool house.

93
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,115
Are you married?

94
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:46,181
No.

95
00:15:47,727 --> 00:15:50,389
Have you ever won an award?

96
00:15:50,463 --> 00:15:54,024
Yes.
- What did you win the award in?

97
00:15:54,066 --> 00:15:55,727
Typing.

98
00:16:00,139 --> 00:16:03,108
Are those your scores?

99
00:16:06,279 --> 00:16:08,372
Yes.

100
00:16:08,414 --> 00:16:10,405
Lee...

101
00:16:10,449 --> 00:16:12,440
Holloway.

102
00:16:22,361 --> 00:16:25,194
Could you get me
a cup of coffee with sugar?

103
00:17:26,592 --> 00:17:29,083
Do you really
want to be a secretary, Lee?

104
00:17:29,128 --> 00:17:31,119
Yes, I do.

105
00:17:38,537 --> 00:17:42,268
You scored higher than anyone
I've ever interviewed.

106
00:17:42,308 --> 00:17:46,972
You're really
overqualified for the job.

107
00:17:47,012 --> 00:17:51,381
You'd be bored to death.
- I want to be bored.

108
00:17:59,058 --> 00:18:03,119
I have a part-time paralegal.

109
00:18:03,162 --> 00:18:11,661
All I need is a typist,
who can get to work on time...

110
00:18:11,704 --> 00:18:14,764
and answer the phone.
- I can do that.

111
00:18:14,807 --> 00:18:18,607
We only use typewriters here,
not computers.

112
00:18:18,644 --> 00:18:23,911
That's fine.
- It's very dull work.

113
00:18:23,949 --> 00:18:26,645
I like dull work.

114
00:18:32,491 --> 00:18:36,052
There's something about you.

115
00:18:37,797 --> 00:18:40,425
You're...

116
00:18:41,801 --> 00:18:46,033
you're... closed tight.

117
00:18:47,106 --> 00:18:50,439
Wall.

118
00:18:50,476 --> 00:18:53,445
I know.

119
00:18:53,479 --> 00:18:56,141
Do you ever loosen up?

120
00:18:58,784 --> 00:19:01,480
I don't know.

121
00:19:05,191 --> 00:19:07,352
I'm not here.

122
00:19:21,607 --> 00:19:24,070
Less sugar in the coffee.

123
00:19:32,451 --> 00:19:34,942
How did it go?

124
00:19:35,955 --> 00:19:38,287
Lee: I got it.

125
00:19:46,532 --> 00:19:50,332
I knew you could do it!

126
00:20:04,116 --> 00:20:06,914
'Hello...'

127
00:20:19,331 --> 00:20:28,494
'Hello. You have reached the office
of Mr. E. Edward Grey.

128
00:20:29,441 --> 00:20:33,309
Please leave your message
and the time you called

129
00:20:33,345 --> 00:20:39,485
along with your phone number
and the best time to reach you...

130
00:20:41,987 --> 00:20:44,319
and we...

131
00:20:44,356 --> 00:20:49,555
will get back to you
as soon as possibIe.'

132
00:20:51,964 --> 00:20:53,955
'We.'

133
00:20:55,034 --> 00:20:57,832
Secretary...

134
00:21:08,681 --> 00:21:12,742
Type up this letter and send
four copies to O'Malley & Barrett.

135
00:21:13,619 --> 00:21:16,019
Right away, sir.

136
00:21:28,434 --> 00:21:31,460
That's good.
That's good.

137
00:21:35,307 --> 00:21:38,071
So you're the new secretary?

138
00:21:39,878 --> 00:21:41,869
Yeah.

139
00:21:45,918 --> 00:21:50,218
Excuse me?
What exactly is a paralegal?

140
00:21:57,763 --> 00:22:00,527
See ya.

141
00:22:22,688 --> 00:22:26,488
Okay...

142
00:22:26,525 --> 00:22:28,516
up...

143
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:31,028
and... wide.

144
00:22:55,554 --> 00:22:57,784
I brought you these.

145
00:23:04,229 --> 00:23:09,857
I think I accidentally threw out
my notes on the Feldman case.

146
00:23:09,902 --> 00:23:13,463
Maybe you could...
- Go through the garbage?

147
00:23:19,745 --> 00:23:22,236
Yes, Lee, thank you.

148
00:24:35,587 --> 00:24:38,215
Why are you here?

149
00:24:38,257 --> 00:24:41,158
I'm just waiting for you, honey.

150
00:24:41,193 --> 00:24:43,821
But I'm here for five more hours.

151
00:24:43,862 --> 00:24:46,558
I know.

152
00:24:57,943 --> 00:25:01,037
Excuse me, sir?

153
00:25:02,281 --> 00:25:04,476
It's okay.
I found another set.

154
00:25:08,153 --> 00:25:11,145
This needs more sugar.
- Sugar?

155
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:13,886
And six copies of these.

156
00:25:15,828 --> 00:25:19,229
Freshen up that trap, Lee,
and put out one more.

157
00:25:46,091 --> 00:25:49,618
Mice like to go behind
the chairs too, Lee.

158
00:25:49,661 --> 00:25:51,652
Just because
it's hard to reach...

159
00:25:51,697 --> 00:25:55,133
does not mean we don't
take care of every possibility.

160
00:26:01,006 --> 00:26:03,907
Here, give me that.

161
00:26:18,624 --> 00:26:20,922
Thank you.

162
00:27:02,167 --> 00:27:05,933
E. Edward Grey's office,
may I heIp you?

163
00:27:05,971 --> 00:27:09,702
We're very happy with AT&T.
Thanks, though.

164
00:27:09,741 --> 00:27:12,904
Is he in?
- Could you just wait one moment?

165
00:27:14,379 --> 00:27:16,677
You're right,
that is a very good offer.

166
00:27:16,715 --> 00:27:21,675
I'm going back now.
- Could you wait one minute, please?

167
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,484
Yes, I do understand that.

168
00:27:24,523 --> 00:27:27,321
Submissive.

169
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:29,987
Excuse me?

170
00:27:30,028 --> 00:27:32,258
Edward!

171
00:27:33,665 --> 00:27:36,566
Listen... I have no idea
if we make...

172
00:27:36,601 --> 00:27:40,594
over $40 worth of long distance
calls to Chattanooga each month.

173
00:27:44,943 --> 00:27:47,241
Tell him it's Tricia O'Connor.

174
00:27:48,547 --> 00:27:51,038
Mr. Grey?

175
00:27:57,622 --> 00:27:59,613
Hello?

176
00:28:03,895 --> 00:28:06,489
Mr. Grey?

177
00:28:06,531 --> 00:28:09,056
Ms. Holloway.

178
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:20,601
Mr. Grey?

179
00:28:20,645 --> 00:28:23,478
I'm not here.

180
00:28:27,319 --> 00:28:29,719
Okay.

181
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:37,058
I'm afraid he's gone.

182
00:28:37,095 --> 00:28:40,223
Is that right?

183
00:28:45,971 --> 00:28:48,667
E. Edward Grey's office.

184
00:28:48,707 --> 00:28:51,972
Is that you honey? It's me.
- Daddy?

185
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:54,501
It's so good to hear your voice.

186
00:28:54,546 --> 00:28:57,174
Dad... where are you?

187
00:28:57,215 --> 00:29:00,275
I'm downtown... somewhere.

188
00:29:00,318 --> 00:29:04,687
Could you pIease hold?

189
00:29:06,058 --> 00:29:08,856
Do you have a message, Ms. O'Connor?

190
00:29:19,171 --> 00:29:21,867
Tell him to sign the settlement.

191
00:29:27,045 --> 00:29:29,036
Hello?

192
00:29:29,081 --> 00:29:32,175
Hello... ?

193
00:29:32,217 --> 00:29:34,481
Hello, Dad?

194
00:30:52,531 --> 00:30:54,556
How's work?

195
00:30:54,599 --> 00:30:56,658
Fine.

196
00:30:56,701 --> 00:30:59,761
How's Mr. Grey?

197
00:30:59,804 --> 00:31:02,432
He's fine.

198
00:31:02,474 --> 00:31:05,068
Well... Peter called.

199
00:31:13,051 --> 00:31:15,815
Some people have to wash something...

200
00:31:15,854 --> 00:31:18,118
as soon as they've worn it
for like half a day.

201
00:31:18,156 --> 00:31:20,386
Yes.
- And then you got...

202
00:31:20,425 --> 00:31:23,258
your more laid-back folk, who will
wash this stuff when it's dirty.

203
00:31:23,295 --> 00:31:25,820
Which kind are you?

204
00:31:25,864 --> 00:31:28,958
I'm the type of guy...

205
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,232
who wants to get married
and have a kid.

206
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:38,671
I wash my clothes
just when they're dirty.

207
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:42,771
Me too, and that
is what counts in a relationship.

208
00:31:42,814 --> 00:31:45,681
Compatibility.

209
00:31:47,152 --> 00:31:49,950
In a relationship?
- In a...

210
00:31:49,988 --> 00:31:52,388
relationship.

211
00:32:02,701 --> 00:32:05,568
May I interest you
in a little more?

212
00:32:05,604 --> 00:32:08,767
Just a little more?
- Why not? Okay.

213
00:32:14,112 --> 00:32:17,206
You're different than you were
in high school, Peter.

214
00:32:17,249 --> 00:32:20,150
I've changed.

215
00:32:20,185 --> 00:32:24,451
What happened?
- I had a nervous breakdown.

216
00:32:24,489 --> 00:32:26,821
Me too.

217
00:32:28,627 --> 00:32:30,618
Sort of.

218
00:32:34,432 --> 00:32:38,562
Tom, I have this and these.

219
00:32:38,603 --> 00:32:40,696
Peter?
- Yes, Lee?

220
00:32:40,739 --> 00:32:49,308
I've read that if you wear that
kind of underwear that it squeezes...

221
00:32:49,347 --> 00:32:51,338
your 'thingies.'

222
00:32:51,383 --> 00:32:54,375
Balls... my balls?
- Yes.

223
00:32:55,186 --> 00:32:58,747
My 'grapes'?
- Your grapes.

224
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:01,258
My...
- Your testicIes.

225
00:33:03,128 --> 00:33:07,588
Your sperm gets 'squozen'
and then you can't have babies...

226
00:33:07,632 --> 00:33:10,123
and I thought that you said
that you wanted to have babies.

227
00:33:10,168 --> 00:33:12,159
There you go,
I said it.

228
00:33:15,106 --> 00:33:17,506
To babies.

229
00:33:17,909 --> 00:33:19,900
Diapers.

230
00:33:19,944 --> 00:33:22,071
Diaper rash.

231
00:33:22,113 --> 00:33:25,480
Breast feeding and crying.

232
00:33:25,517 --> 00:33:28,042
Vomit.

233
00:34:11,229 --> 00:34:13,220
Look at it.

234
00:34:13,932 --> 00:34:16,492
Do you see that?
- What?

235
00:34:16,534 --> 00:34:18,593
This letter has
three typing errors in it,

236
00:34:18,636 --> 00:34:21,002
one of which is,
I believe, a spelling error.

237
00:34:23,408 --> 00:34:25,399
I'm sorry.
- This isn't the first time, either.

238
00:34:25,443 --> 00:34:27,434
There have been others
that I let go...

239
00:34:27,479 --> 00:34:30,175
in the first few weeks.
This cannot go on.

240
00:34:30,215 --> 00:34:32,046
Do you know what this
makes me look like...

241
00:34:32,083 --> 00:34:34,074
to the peopIe who receive
these letters?

242
00:34:34,119 --> 00:34:36,110
I'm sorry.

243
00:34:36,154 --> 00:34:40,386
Type it again...
and get it right.

244
00:34:58,710 --> 00:34:59,404
You're wasting my time.

245
00:35:40,985 --> 00:35:42,976
Bye.

246
00:35:57,969 --> 00:36:00,802
Go type up a bill
for that woman for $500.

247
00:36:00,839 --> 00:36:03,831
Aren't you going
to proofread the letter?

248
00:36:20,525 --> 00:36:22,789
Lee...

249
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:27,321
when peopIe come
into this office,...

250
00:36:27,365 --> 00:36:30,960
you are a visual
representation of my business...

251
00:36:31,002 --> 00:36:33,766
and the way
you dress is disgusting.

252
00:36:35,139 --> 00:36:39,542
Sorry.

253
00:36:39,577 --> 00:36:43,206
You're tapping your toe all the time
and playing with your hair.

254
00:36:43,248 --> 00:36:45,239
You're either going
to have to wear a hair net

255
00:36:45,283 --> 00:36:48,013
or stop playing with your hair.

256
00:36:51,022 --> 00:36:53,684
And another thing...

257
00:36:53,725 --> 00:36:57,627
do you realize that you
are always sniffling?

258
00:36:57,662 --> 00:37:00,722
I'm sniffling?

259
00:37:00,765 --> 00:37:03,859
And what is with
your tongue...

260
00:37:03,902 --> 00:37:06,962
when you're typing?

261
00:37:07,005 --> 00:37:10,497
I'm sorry,
I didn't know I sniffled.

262
00:37:10,542 --> 00:37:14,945
Well, you do.

263
00:37:21,319 --> 00:37:24,015
'Mr. Grey...

264
00:37:24,055 --> 00:37:30,285
thank you so much for
your helpful suggestions.

265
00:37:30,328 --> 00:37:35,195
Because I am trying to be...

266
00:37:35,233 --> 00:37:42,050
the very best secretary
that I can be for you.'

267
00:37:42,807 --> 00:37:44,798
The sentence should read,...

268
00:37:44,842 --> 00:37:48,369
'Without proper guidance
from a knowledgeable source,...

269
00:37:48,413 --> 00:37:51,143
my client would never have made...

270
00:37:51,182 --> 00:37:54,743
these material decisions
on her own.' Period!

271
00:37:54,786 --> 00:37:56,811
I have repeated the sentence...

272
00:38:12,503 --> 00:38:14,937
Are you sure
you wouldn't like some wine?

273
00:38:14,973 --> 00:38:18,033
We make it homemade,
don't we, Stewart?

274
00:38:18,076 --> 00:38:21,512
Try it, it's good.
- Would you like some, Lee?

275
00:38:21,546 --> 00:38:25,346
No, thank you.
Not right now, Sylvia.

276
00:38:25,383 --> 00:38:27,874
Peter taIks about you all the time.

277
00:38:27,919 --> 00:38:31,616
He says he's found his soul mate.

278
00:38:31,656 --> 00:38:34,591
Did you say that?

279
00:38:36,527 --> 00:38:39,826
I did.
- Peter's sister Lindsey...

280
00:38:39,864 --> 00:38:44,130
is getting married
this coming winter in Vegas.

281
00:38:45,503 --> 00:38:48,165
Did you know Peter has
a very stable job at J. C. Penney?

282
00:38:48,206 --> 00:38:51,403
They even gave him a cell phone.
- Perhaps it'II be a double wedding?

283
00:38:54,779 --> 00:38:57,043
Mom...

284
00:39:20,705 --> 00:39:22,866
Ms. Holloway.

285
00:39:22,907 --> 00:39:25,341
Come into the library...

286
00:39:25,376 --> 00:39:28,004
immediateIy.

287
00:39:44,395 --> 00:39:46,386
'...the remarks made in print,...

288
00:39:46,431 --> 00:39:48,422
in summation
of the events in regard...

289
00:39:48,466 --> 00:39:52,334
to the Rubin Berkowitz libel.
Yours sincerely,' etc.

290
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,831
Okay.

291
00:39:57,875 --> 00:40:00,366
The phone is ringing.

292
00:40:05,850 --> 00:40:07,841
Answer it.

293
00:40:10,488 --> 00:40:13,184
I'm sorry...
- Brr-ing!

294
00:40:14,792 --> 00:40:17,124
Brr-ing!

295
00:40:18,062 --> 00:40:21,259
Oh.
- Brr-rr--!

296
00:40:22,567 --> 00:40:26,162
'Hello.
This is the office of...'

297
00:40:26,204 --> 00:40:28,195
Listen... you're a big girl.

298
00:40:28,239 --> 00:40:32,505
You can get a much bigger voice
out of that tiny throat of yours.

299
00:40:33,511 --> 00:40:36,810
Tiny?
- Ms. Holloway,...

300
00:40:36,848 --> 00:40:41,342
you told me when I hired you that
you were used to answering phones.

301
00:40:41,385 --> 00:40:44,411
I am.

302
00:40:44,455 --> 00:40:46,719
Did you get
enough sleep last night?

303
00:40:46,758 --> 00:40:49,852
I...
- The phone is ringing.

304
00:40:52,330 --> 00:40:54,423
'Hello...

305
00:40:54,465 --> 00:40:58,561
this is the office
of Mr. E. Edward Grey.'

306
00:40:58,603 --> 00:41:01,231
You see? You see?

307
00:41:01,272 --> 00:41:05,436
That's showing a little spunk.
I'm not running a mortuary.

308
00:41:05,476 --> 00:41:07,501
No.

309
00:41:17,688 --> 00:41:19,986
Lee.

310
00:41:20,024 --> 00:41:22,618
Mr. Grey...?

311
00:41:23,694 --> 00:41:26,527
Come here.

312
00:41:52,423 --> 00:41:54,789
Did you have a date recently?

313
00:41:58,696 --> 00:42:00,857
Yes.

314
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,234
With whom did you have a date?

315
00:42:06,537 --> 00:42:08,596
Peter.
- Peter.

316
00:42:08,639 --> 00:42:10,834
Did you have sex?

317
00:42:12,443 --> 00:42:15,412
No?

318
00:42:17,515 --> 00:42:20,211
I don't know.

319
00:42:22,486 --> 00:42:26,013
Are you shy?

320
00:42:26,057 --> 00:42:28,992
I'm shy.

321
00:42:29,026 --> 00:42:33,224
You're not shy.
You're a lawyer.

322
00:42:35,967 --> 00:42:38,435
I'm shy.

323
00:42:38,469 --> 00:42:40,903
I overcome my shyness...

324
00:42:43,007 --> 00:42:46,272
in order to get things done.

325
00:42:47,478 --> 00:42:50,038
I don't think you're shy.

326
00:42:54,919 --> 00:42:57,410
Lee, I'm going
to be frank with you.

327
00:42:57,455 --> 00:43:01,323
I know I'm your employer...

328
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:05,159
and we have
a proscribed relationship...

329
00:43:08,366 --> 00:43:13,926
but you really should feel
free...

330
00:43:15,439 --> 00:43:19,136
to discuss your
problems with me.

331
00:43:30,087 --> 00:43:32,783
What's going on with
the sewing kit and the Band-Aids?

332
00:43:40,665 --> 00:43:42,656
Lee...?

333
00:43:45,870 --> 00:43:48,361
I feel...

334
00:43:50,241 --> 00:43:52,505
Shy.

335
00:43:55,546 --> 00:43:58,037
Do you want some hot chocolate?

336
00:43:58,082 --> 00:44:00,073
Okay.

337
00:44:14,231 --> 00:44:16,495
Why do you cut yourseIf, Lee?

338
00:44:21,939 --> 00:44:24,464
I don't know.

339
00:44:24,508 --> 00:44:27,409
Is it that sometimes the pain
inside has to come to the surface...

340
00:44:27,445 --> 00:44:30,039
and when you see evidence
of the pain inside...

341
00:44:30,081 --> 00:44:32,515
you finally know
you're really here?

342
00:44:32,550 --> 00:44:38,288
Then when you watch the wound heal
it's comforting, isn't it?

343
00:44:40,391 --> 00:44:42,382
I...

344
00:44:45,896 --> 00:44:48,091
that's a way to put it.

345
00:44:48,132 --> 00:44:51,693
I'm going to tell you something.
Are you ready to listen?

346
00:44:53,070 --> 00:44:55,937
Yes.
- Are you listening?

347
00:44:59,210 --> 00:45:01,201
You will never...

348
00:45:01,245 --> 00:45:03,236
ever...

349
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:05,805
cut yourself again.

350
00:45:05,850 --> 00:45:08,148
Do you understand?

351
00:45:08,185 --> 00:45:11,712
Have I made that perfectly cIear?

352
00:45:11,756 --> 00:45:14,452
You're over that now.

353
00:45:14,492 --> 00:45:16,483
It's in the past.

354
00:45:22,733 --> 00:45:24,724
Yes.

355
00:45:27,338 --> 00:45:29,363
Never again.

356
00:45:32,143 --> 00:45:34,134
Okay.

357
00:45:35,146 --> 00:45:38,707
Now, you know what
I want you to do?

358
00:45:40,985 --> 00:45:43,715
I want you to leave work early.

359
00:45:45,222 --> 00:45:47,690
You're a big girl...
a grown woman,...

360
00:45:47,725 --> 00:45:51,058
your mother doesn't need
to pick you up every day.

361
00:45:51,095 --> 00:45:54,326
I want you
to take a nice walk home,...

362
00:45:54,365 --> 00:45:58,028
in the fresh air,
because you require relief.

363
00:45:58,069 --> 00:46:03,564
Because you won't be
doing that anymore, will you?

364
00:46:03,607 --> 00:46:07,236
No, sir.

365
00:46:07,278 --> 00:46:10,008
Good.

366
00:46:24,495 --> 00:46:26,986
Oh, it's early.

367
00:46:27,998 --> 00:46:30,296
Mom...

368
00:46:30,334 --> 00:46:34,065
I'm going to walk home
from now on.

369
00:46:35,573 --> 00:46:38,974
I took a shortcut
through Hawkins Park,...

370
00:46:39,009 --> 00:46:42,308
and it was as if
I'd never taken a walk

371
00:46:42,346 --> 00:46:45,281
by myself before.
And when I thought about it,...

372
00:46:45,316 --> 00:46:49,685
I realized that I had probably
never had taken a walk alone.

373
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:52,848
But because he had given me
the permission to do this...

374
00:46:52,890 --> 00:47:00,727
because he'd insisted I do it,
I felt held by him as I walked along.

375
00:47:00,764 --> 00:47:03,790
I felt he was with me.

376
00:47:03,868 --> 00:47:11,170
At the same time I was feeling
something growing in Mr. Grey...

377
00:47:11,208 --> 00:47:16,612
an intimate tendril creeping
from one of his darker areas,...

378
00:47:16,647 --> 00:47:23,318
nursed on the feeling that he
had discovered something about me.

379
00:47:23,354 --> 00:47:27,851
The next day I didn't even bring
my cuticle scissors and my iodine...

380
00:47:27,892 --> 00:47:30,554
but I did make
another typing mistake.

381
00:47:30,594 --> 00:47:33,461
What is wrong with you?
That is all you have to do...

382
00:47:33,497 --> 00:47:36,398
type and answer the phones.
Is that beyond you?

383
00:47:36,433 --> 00:47:38,765
I'm sorry.
- It certainly seems to be.

384
00:47:38,802 --> 00:47:41,362
I'm sorry.
- Don't apologize to me.

385
00:47:41,405 --> 00:47:45,808
What goes on inside
that head of yours?

386
00:48:34,391 --> 00:48:37,383
Come into my office
and bring that letter.

387
00:48:50,808 --> 00:48:53,402
Put the letter on my desk.

388
00:49:03,887 --> 00:49:07,983
I want you to bend over the desk
so you're looking directly at it.

389
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:14,758
Get your face very close to the letter
and read the letter aloud.

390
00:49:15,766 --> 00:49:18,200
I don't understand.

391
00:49:18,235 --> 00:49:21,033
There's nothing to understand.

392
00:49:21,071 --> 00:49:23,505
Put your elbows on the desk...

393
00:49:23,540 --> 00:49:25,565
bend over...

394
00:49:25,609 --> 00:49:30,370
get your face close to the letter
and read it aloud.

395
00:49:40,524 --> 00:49:42,856
'Dear Mr. Garvey,...

396
00:49:42,893 --> 00:49:45,691
I'm grateful
to you for referring...'

397
00:49:57,841 --> 00:50:00,366
Continue.

398
00:50:03,914 --> 00:50:07,179
Ms. Holloway, read.

399
00:50:18,295 --> 00:50:22,129
'...for referring me to your case.

400
00:50:23,233 --> 00:50:25,667
The subject of animal captivity...

401
00:50:25,703 --> 00:50:28,331
has been of interest
to me for quite a while,...

402
00:50:28,372 --> 00:50:32,468
and my secretary has prepared...
research material...

403
00:50:32,509 --> 00:50:35,876
that I think you will
find illuminating.

404
00:50:35,913 --> 00:50:38,347
If you wouId be so kind...

405
00:50:40,050 --> 00:50:44,350
as to send me the June 5th Ietter
of which we spoke,...

406
00:50:44,388 --> 00:50:48,256
my associates and I
will review it immediately.

407
00:50:49,259 --> 00:50:53,719
Please feel free to call me
at your earliest convenience.

408
00:50:53,764 --> 00:50:58,360
Yours sincerely,
E. Edward Grey.'

409
00:51:07,010 --> 00:51:09,501
Read it again.

410
00:51:14,752 --> 00:51:17,186
'Dear Mr. Garvey...'

411
00:51:20,257 --> 00:51:22,725
'I am grateful to you...'

412
00:51:24,795 --> 00:51:27,195
'for referring me to your case.

413

414
00:51:37,908 --> 00:51:41,776

417
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:32,588
Now straighten yourseIf up
and go type it again.

418
00:54:20,504 --> 00:54:23,905
Ms. Holloway?
Good letter.

419
00:54:43,493 --> 00:54:45,484
Mom?

420
00:54:45,529 --> 00:54:49,397
The lock can
come off the cabinet now.

421
00:54:58,208 --> 00:55:00,802
Oh, honey.

422
00:56:06,076 --> 00:56:09,341
Replace the light bulb
in the hallway to my office.

423
00:56:10,614 --> 00:56:12,605
120 watts.

424
00:56:12,649 --> 00:56:14,981
Mr. Grey.
- Good to see you again, Mr. Garvey.

425
00:56:15,018 --> 00:56:17,282
You remember my secretary,
Ms. Holloway.

426
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:20,380
I'm sorry about the typo.

427
00:56:29,066 --> 00:56:32,968
It's porterhouse steak,
mashed... no...

428
00:56:33,003 --> 00:56:39,000
creamed potatoes, green peas,
iced tea and ice cream.

429
00:56:39,042 --> 00:56:42,534
Okay. Just a scoop
of creamed potatoes...

430
00:56:42,579 --> 00:56:45,343
and a slice of butter.

431
00:56:45,382 --> 00:56:48,442
Four peas...

432
00:56:49,453 --> 00:56:52,149
and as much ice cream
as you like to eat.

433
00:57:31,394 --> 00:57:34,955
'Cosmo's' advice for
'getting your man...

434
00:57:34,998 --> 00:57:37,865
to share his feelings
more intimately'

435
00:57:37,901 --> 00:57:41,530
is to first try
some 'breezy humor.'

436
00:57:41,571 --> 00:57:48,271
Whatever you do, don't jump too
quickly into 'relationship talk.'

437
00:59:06,890 --> 00:59:09,518
I'm your secretary.

438
00:59:09,559 --> 00:59:11,652
I'm your secretary.

439
00:59:11,695 --> 00:59:16,132
Just one scoop
of creamed potatoes,

440
00:59:16,166 --> 00:59:18,566
one slice of butter...

441
00:59:18,602 --> 00:59:22,436
oh... and four peas...

442
00:59:27,344 --> 00:59:30,802
How many inches away
was the furnace...?

443
00:59:30,847 --> 00:59:35,681
Had you turned off the furnace before
you went down into the basement?

444
00:59:43,860 --> 00:59:45,885
Okay...

445
00:59:45,929 --> 00:59:48,762
maybe you didn't
squeeze it hard enough.

446
00:59:50,066 --> 00:59:53,866
There's always concern
about it bursting.

447
00:59:56,072 --> 00:59:59,508
No, God no.
I haven't had time to get to that.

448
01:00:00,644 --> 01:00:03,613
I'm doing as much
as I possibly can.

449
01:00:09,619 --> 01:00:13,285
Where was she when you
crawled under the house?

450
01:00:15,592 --> 01:00:19,028
And the lock box? Did you cover it
with dirt before you left?

451
01:00:19,462 --> 01:00:22,625
Mud upstairs?

452
01:00:22,666 --> 01:00:26,033
No, I'm confused by that.

453
01:00:26,069 --> 01:00:28,162
Ah, but...

454
01:00:28,204 --> 01:00:32,334
this was the overweight child
or your nephew from Baltimore?

455
01:00:33,310 --> 01:00:35,801
On the banister.

456
01:00:42,752 --> 01:00:45,653
I have to work.

457
01:00:47,824 --> 01:00:52,124
Okay. Give me a week
and I'll have something for you.

458
01:00:52,162 --> 01:00:54,153
I'm sorry, the office has been...

459
01:00:55,999 --> 01:00:58,467
overwhelmed.

460
01:01:00,770 --> 01:01:03,637
Mr. Grey, I'm going
to go home now.

461
01:01:03,673 --> 01:01:10,538
If you need any more typing done
I could come back later.

462
01:01:15,085 --> 01:01:18,486
Thank you, Ms. Holloway.
Good night.

463
01:01:25,362 --> 01:01:27,353
That will be all.

464
01:01:33,403 --> 01:01:35,394
Oh, here's just one example.

465
01:01:35,438 --> 01:01:39,996
He asked me out to Red Lobster
the other night for a nightcap.

466
01:01:40,744 --> 01:01:43,907
And yesterday he asked
if my hose were control top...

467
01:01:43,947 --> 01:01:46,472
and if they were,
I certainIy didn't need it.

468
01:01:46,516 --> 01:01:48,916
Your boss?
- Yeah.

469
01:01:48,952 --> 01:01:51,853
You shouId sue him
for sexual harassment.

470
01:01:51,888 --> 01:01:54,220
I like that idea.
- Hello?

471
01:01:54,257 --> 01:01:58,283
My lawyer is representing a woman who's
suing her boss for sexual harassment.

472
01:01:58,328 --> 01:02:00,626
Is he a good lawyer?

473
01:02:00,663 --> 01:02:03,154
He's the best.

474
01:02:03,199 --> 01:02:07,260
'He's the best.'
- How long will he be there?

475
01:02:13,476 --> 01:02:15,910
Who was that?

476
01:02:15,945 --> 01:02:18,880
He checked himself into the hospitaI.

477
01:02:44,674 --> 01:02:46,164
Lee...?

478
01:03:17,474 --> 01:03:19,772
Yes, Lee?

479
01:03:19,809 --> 01:03:23,540
Hi.

480
01:03:26,583 --> 01:03:28,574
I...

481
01:03:28,618 --> 01:03:32,645
I just wanted...

482
01:03:34,557 --> 01:03:37,321
I needed you...

483
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:41,490
I wanted you to...

484
01:03:43,900 --> 01:03:46,425
You need me to what?

485
01:03:53,276 --> 01:03:57,302
I just wanted you to not forget to
go over the Lynch papers for tomorrow.

486
01:04:00,984 --> 01:04:02,975
No, I haven't.

487
01:04:03,019 --> 01:04:05,817
That's good.

488
01:04:11,060 --> 01:04:12,994
Thank you, Lee.

489
01:04:59,842 --> 01:05:02,538
After he turned me
away from his house,...

490
01:05:02,579 --> 01:05:08,341
he put me back at my old desk
and he just stopped doing it.

491
01:05:08,384 --> 01:05:11,285
He threw out all his red pens.

492
01:05:11,854 --> 01:05:13,845
I kept making typos...

493
01:05:13,890 --> 01:05:18,725
but he just treated me
like a regular old secretary.

494
01:05:18,761 --> 01:05:20,752
Are you coming?

495
01:05:20,797 --> 01:05:24,460
After a while I began to wonder
if that was all I was.

496
01:05:27,370 --> 01:05:29,702
Have we received
any checks from Mr. Garvey?

497
01:05:29,739 --> 01:05:32,572
No, sir.

498
01:05:32,609 --> 01:05:34,600
File these.

499
01:05:43,553 --> 01:05:45,578
That's a pretty tie.

500
01:05:45,622 --> 01:05:48,420
But I guess you
won't be golfing today.

501
01:05:48,458 --> 01:05:49,948
What?

502
01:05:49,993 --> 01:05:53,622
Your tie...
it has golfers on it.

503
01:06:00,003 --> 01:06:01,994
Right.

504
01:06:05,008 --> 01:06:07,272
Damn it.

505
01:09:13,562 --> 01:09:15,453
Don't be scared.

506
01:09:15,498 --> 01:09:20,231
I'm not.

507
01:09:31,047 --> 01:09:34,448
That's not what I meant.

508
01:09:35,418 --> 01:09:38,216
I'm sorry.

509
01:09:39,255 --> 01:09:41,246
Look here, see...

510
01:09:42,258 --> 01:09:44,283
I'm sorry.

511
01:09:45,261 --> 01:09:47,320
Okay...

512
01:09:47,363 --> 01:09:50,890
but my cIothes get to stay on
and I want the lights out.

513
01:10:28,804 --> 01:10:31,500
I didn't hurt you, did I?

514
01:10:33,042 --> 01:10:35,033
No.

515
01:12:06,068 --> 01:12:08,593
Ms. Holloway?

516
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:13,031
Yes, Mr. Grey?

517
01:12:13,075 --> 01:12:15,635
Come in to my office.

518
01:12:17,913 --> 01:12:20,746
But Mr. Marvel is waiting.

519
01:12:22,151 --> 01:12:24,984
Ms. Holloway,
come in to my office.

520
01:12:25,021 --> 01:12:27,285
Yes, sir.

521
01:12:29,058 --> 01:12:31,618
Finally.

522
01:13:07,563 --> 01:13:09,827
Ignore it.

523
01:13:26,148 --> 01:13:28,480
Now pull up your skirt.

524
01:13:30,853 --> 01:13:32,844
Why?

525
01:13:32,888 --> 01:13:36,380
You're not worried that I'm going
to fuck you, are you?

526
01:13:37,860 --> 01:13:41,159
I'm not interested in that,
not in the least.

527
01:13:41,197 --> 01:13:43,927
Now pull up your skirt.

528
01:13:48,537 --> 01:13:51,529
Lee...? Lee?

529
01:13:54,844 --> 01:13:57,438
I said, pull up your skirt.

530
01:13:59,915 --> 01:14:01,906
Peter?

531
01:14:02,918 --> 01:14:06,854
I'm not going to be able to come
to the diner today, okay?

532
01:14:10,693 --> 01:14:12,684
Okay.

533
01:14:12,728 --> 01:14:16,994
That's okay, 'cause...
it's all right.

534
01:14:41,056 --> 01:14:44,116
Pull down your pantyhose
and underwear.

535
01:14:48,931 --> 01:14:51,923
I told you I'm not
going to fuck you.

536
01:17:45,574 --> 01:17:48,236
Get these forms filled out.

537
01:17:48,277 --> 01:17:51,212
And then you can
take your lunch break.

538
01:17:51,246 --> 01:17:54,647
Bring me my sandwich,
I'm eating in.

539
01:17:54,683 --> 01:17:57,311
And...

540
01:17:59,755 --> 01:18:02,417
go have the usual.

541
01:18:05,194 --> 01:18:08,095
No mayonnaise this time.

542
01:18:08,130 --> 01:18:10,121
And...

543
01:18:10,899 --> 01:18:14,096
send in what's-his-name.

544
01:18:19,475 --> 01:18:21,466
Okay?

545
01:19:06,889 --> 01:19:08,880
Mr. Grey.

546
01:19:29,711 --> 01:19:31,702
Cock.

547
01:19:31,747 --> 01:19:34,716
Place your prick in my mouth.

548
01:19:34,750 --> 01:19:37,310
Screw me.

549
01:19:54,903 --> 01:19:57,838
Oh shit. Fuck.

550
01:19:57,873 --> 01:20:01,365
Mayonnaise.
Orchid.

551
01:20:02,044 --> 01:20:04,740
Oh, Mr. Grey...!

552
01:20:27,903 --> 01:20:30,428
Edward.

553
01:20:49,191 --> 01:20:54,191
Most people think that the best way
to live is to run from pain.

554
01:20:54,229 --> 01:20:56,459
But a much more joyful life...

555
01:20:56,498 --> 01:20:59,797
embraces the entire spectrum
of human feeling.

556
01:20:59,835 --> 01:21:03,236
If we can fully experience
pain as well as pIeasure,...

557
01:21:03,272 --> 01:21:09,336
we can live a much deeper
and more meaningful life.

558
01:21:56,825 --> 01:21:58,816
Ms. Holloway?

559
01:22:01,296 --> 01:22:04,356
Yes, sir?
- Bring your typing scores.

560
01:22:04,566 --> 01:22:06,557
Okay.

561
01:22:29,424 --> 01:22:31,449
What happened?

562
01:22:33,495 --> 01:22:36,055
Are you pregnant?

563
01:22:37,599 --> 01:22:39,590
No.

564
01:22:40,502 --> 01:22:42,970
Do you plan on being pregnant?
- Could I...

565
01:22:43,005 --> 01:22:45,701
You plan on getting pregnant?

566
01:22:46,708 --> 01:22:48,699
No.

567
01:22:48,744 --> 01:22:50,905
Are you living in an apartment?

568
01:22:50,946 --> 01:22:53,039
A house.

569
01:22:53,081 --> 01:22:56,812
Alone?
- With my parents.

570
01:22:56,852 --> 01:23:00,151
Are you married?

571
01:23:01,456 --> 01:23:03,447
No.

572
01:23:13,001 --> 01:23:15,936
Are those your scores?

573
01:23:15,971 --> 01:23:18,166
Yes.

574
01:23:23,979 --> 01:23:26,675
Do you really want
to be my secretary?

575
01:23:29,718 --> 01:23:31,879
Yes, I do.

576
01:23:36,058 --> 01:23:38,652
This isn't just about typos,
tape, staples and pencils,...

577
01:23:38,694 --> 01:23:41,595
is it, Lee?
- No, sir.

578
01:23:41,630 --> 01:23:43,621
What?

579
01:23:43,665 --> 01:23:46,156
No, sir.

580
01:23:50,038 --> 01:23:53,474
I like you Lee, but I don't think
I'm going to offer you the job.

581
01:23:56,445 --> 01:23:58,777
Why?

582
01:23:59,681 --> 01:24:02,172
It's your behavior.

583
01:24:03,452 --> 01:24:05,750
What about my behavior?

584
01:24:05,787 --> 01:24:07,914
It's very bad.

585
01:24:11,660 --> 01:24:15,118
I'm sorry.
You can collect your things.

586
01:24:16,598 --> 01:24:18,793
Time out.
- Time out?

587
01:24:18,834 --> 01:24:21,098
You're fired.
- You're fired!

588
01:24:21,136 --> 01:24:24,003
You're fired!
Now, Lee. Get out!

589
01:24:30,912 --> 01:24:35,076
Why did you get glue smear
all over the Ramsey papers?

590
01:24:35,117 --> 01:24:37,881
Because I was fixing your shredder.
You saw me.

591
01:24:37,919 --> 01:24:42,913
Are you aware you kick
your shoes off under your desk?

592
01:24:42,958 --> 01:24:44,949
I can smell your feet.
Do you ever change your pantyhose?

593
01:24:44,993 --> 01:24:47,621
Every day.
- Every time you erase...

594
01:24:47,662 --> 01:24:50,187
there are littIe shavings
all over your desk.

595
01:24:50,232 --> 01:24:53,929
I told you to take
that Walkman home.

596
01:24:53,969 --> 01:24:57,803
I don't want the possibility
of your listening to music...

597
01:24:57,839 --> 01:25:00,034
when you're supposed
to be working for me.

598
01:25:00,075 --> 01:25:03,238
I saw it in your desk...
I know it's there.

599
01:25:03,278 --> 01:25:05,712
I'll move it.

600
01:25:44,753 --> 01:25:47,745
You have to go
or I won't stop.

601
01:25:48,790 --> 01:25:51,281
Don't.

602
01:25:53,595 --> 01:25:56,723
I cannot do this anymore.

603
01:25:58,767 --> 01:26:01,531
But I want to know you.

604
01:26:27,162 --> 01:26:30,325
I'm so sorry for
what happened between us.

605
01:26:31,333 --> 01:26:38,331
I realize what a terrible mistake
I made with you.

606
01:26:38,373 --> 01:26:43,037
And I can only hope
that you understand.

607
01:26:43,078 --> 01:26:47,538
Be assured you can count on me
for excellent references.

608
01:26:52,187 --> 01:26:54,178
Get out.

609
01:26:55,824 --> 01:26:57,815
Get out.

610
01:26:57,859 --> 01:27:00,487
What are you do...
- Get out!

611
01:28:15,904 --> 01:28:19,362
I opened the envelope
the second I got home.

612
01:28:19,407 --> 01:28:25,209
It was a check for $680.
More than he actually owed me.

613
01:28:25,246 --> 01:28:28,773
It occurred to me
to tear up the check, but I didn't.

614
01:28:28,817 --> 01:28:31,513
I felt like I was doing
the right thing.

615
01:28:31,553 --> 01:28:35,421
And I didn't tell anybody
about any of it.

616
01:28:35,523 --> 01:28:38,651
I pretended to go
to work as usual,...

617
01:28:38,693 --> 01:28:42,254
and watched his office
from across the street.

618
01:28:42,297 --> 01:28:46,823
He hired a new girl and
changed the locks on the doors.

619
01:28:48,236 --> 01:28:51,865
There was just nothing
for me to do about it.

620
01:29:01,983 --> 01:29:05,282
My doctor at the
institution once said,...

621
01:29:05,320 --> 01:29:08,756
'Every journey begins
with the first step.'

622
01:29:08,790 --> 01:29:12,886
So I decided it was time
to meet someone new.

623
01:29:14,195 --> 01:29:17,722
There was one who tried
to grab and pinch my nipples...

624
01:29:17,766 --> 01:29:20,200
before we even
made it to his car.

625
01:29:20,235 --> 01:29:21,395
Hi.

626
01:29:21,436 --> 01:29:24,837
Another guy kept ordering me
to pee on his patio...

627
01:29:24,873 --> 01:29:28,434
and when I refused, he said...
- I thought you were a masochist.

628
01:29:28,476 --> 01:29:31,775
Then there was the one who liked
being tied to a gas stove...

629
01:29:31,813 --> 01:29:33,804
while the burners were on
full blast.

630
01:29:33,848 --> 01:29:36,874
I had to throw tomatoes at him.
- Thank you.

631
01:29:36,918 --> 01:29:40,354
For a while I stopped trying
and stayed at home...

632
01:29:40,388 --> 01:29:43,949
helping Dad adjust
to his new sobriety.

633
01:29:43,992 --> 01:29:47,689
Until one day,
out of the blue,...

634
01:29:47,729 --> 01:29:53,592
Peter proposed marriage to me
in the basement of J.C. Penney's.

635
01:29:53,635 --> 01:29:56,968
I think I said yes because
I didn't know what else to do.

636
01:29:57,005 --> 01:30:00,907
I guess I was a little lighter
than you in those days.

637
01:30:00,942 --> 01:30:02,933
Okay.

638
01:30:05,046 --> 01:30:07,776
If you hold your breath through
the wedding, you'll make it.

639
01:30:07,816 --> 01:30:09,875
Don't move.
I'm going to get Stewart.

640
01:30:09,918 --> 01:30:13,410
You're beautiful,
you're just too beautiful.

641
01:30:36,778 --> 01:30:38,245
Lee...?

642
01:30:38,279 --> 01:30:41,146
No! I'm not supposed to see you
before the wedding.

643
01:30:41,182 --> 01:30:43,377
Where are you going?

644
01:30:58,166 --> 01:31:01,624
I have something to say to you.
- Lee.

645
01:31:01,669 --> 01:31:03,330
I love you.

646
01:31:03,371 --> 01:31:06,135
Lee, you should not be here.

647
01:31:06,174 --> 01:31:08,870
I love you.

648
01:31:21,589 --> 01:31:25,320
I'm sorry, I... but I don't
believe that to be true.

649
01:31:25,360 --> 01:31:27,419
Well, it is true.

650
01:31:27,462 --> 01:31:29,453
It is.

651
01:31:31,299 --> 01:31:34,097
This matter was resolved...

652
01:31:34,135 --> 01:31:36,194
when I received your canceled
severance check.

653
01:31:37,205 --> 01:31:39,673
I love you.

654
01:31:42,343 --> 01:31:45,540
We can't do this 24 hours a day,
seven days a week.

655
01:31:45,580 --> 01:31:47,912
Why not?

656
01:32:02,063 --> 01:32:04,793
Put both your hands
on the desk, palms down.

657
01:32:12,740 --> 01:32:15,732
I want to make love.

658
01:32:22,183 --> 01:32:25,550
Keep both your feet
on the floor until I come back.

659
01:33:15,603 --> 01:33:17,867
Hello?
- In case you're wondering,...

660
01:33:17,906 --> 01:33:20,739
your fiancée is at my office.

661
01:33:54,042 --> 01:33:58,103
Lee, I'm very fond
of you as well...

662
01:34:03,418 --> 01:34:05,852
Oh, it's you.

663
01:34:14,228 --> 01:34:16,992
Lee, what are you doing?

664
01:34:17,031 --> 01:34:20,762
Lee, I don't... I don't know
how to deal with...

665
01:34:20,802 --> 01:34:23,100
I'm sorry, I'm going to have
to ask you to leave.

666
01:34:25,907 --> 01:34:27,932
I'm your fiancé, Lee.

667
01:34:27,976 --> 01:34:31,070
You are trespassing.

668
01:34:31,112 --> 01:34:34,013
You are making
an unwarranted incursion...

669
01:34:34,048 --> 01:34:37,984
a gradual or stealthy entrance
into the sphere of another.

670
01:34:41,489 --> 01:34:47,194
Okay, Lee...
are you doing something...

671
01:34:48,396 --> 01:34:50,660
sexual, right now?

672
01:34:50,698 --> 01:34:53,861
Does this look sexual to you?

673
01:34:56,137 --> 01:34:58,128
I don't know, Lee!

674
01:34:59,474 --> 01:35:02,910
Why don't you move your hands?

675
01:35:05,446 --> 01:35:08,973
Because I don't want to.

676
01:35:11,953 --> 01:35:13,944
No!

677
01:35:43,985 --> 01:35:47,216
Peter...

678
01:35:47,255 --> 01:35:49,780
I don't want you.

679
01:35:54,228 --> 01:35:56,219
Now, get out.

680
01:35:57,632 --> 01:35:59,623
Get out.

681
01:36:01,869 --> 01:36:04,360
Get out!

682
01:36:44,178 --> 01:36:47,204
I brought you some peas.

683
01:36:51,552 --> 01:36:53,577
There are no statutes
capable of controlling...

684
01:36:53,621 --> 01:36:56,317
the relations between
men and women.

685
01:36:56,357 --> 01:36:58,723
There are other ways
to show your feelings, Lee.

686
01:36:58,759 --> 01:37:00,784
More conventional ways.

687
01:37:00,828 --> 01:37:05,060
I expect that dress back,
dry cleaned, in perfect condition.

688
01:37:05,099 --> 01:37:08,557
I'm just going to leave
you with this literature.

689
01:37:08,603 --> 01:37:12,630
Why don't you read
about women's struggle first?

690
01:37:26,888 --> 01:37:29,982
You know, Lee,...

691
01:37:30,024 --> 01:37:33,152
there's a long history
of this in Catholicism.

692
01:37:33,194 --> 01:37:37,392
The monks used to wear
thorns on their temples.

693
01:37:37,431 --> 01:37:40,832
And the nuns wore them
sewn inside their clothing.

694
01:37:40,868 --> 01:37:44,531
Two years ago when it didn't
work out between us, that was it.

695
01:37:44,572 --> 01:37:46,563
I let him slip through my fingers.

696
01:37:46,607 --> 01:37:50,976
You are part of a great tradition.
- I admire you, Ms. Holloway.

697
01:37:51,012 --> 01:37:55,108
Without question, he is the most
isolated man I've ever known.

698
01:37:55,149 --> 01:37:57,549
The worm... amazing.

699
01:37:57,585 --> 01:38:01,385
Who's to say that love
needs to be soft and gentle?

700
01:38:01,422 --> 01:38:05,791
'You are the child of God's
hoIy gift of life.

701
01:38:05,826 --> 01:38:11,590
You come from me,
but you are not me.

702
01:38:11,632 --> 01:38:14,726
Your soul and your body
are your own,...

703
01:38:14,769 --> 01:38:18,603
and yours to do with
as you wish.'

704
01:38:20,741 --> 01:38:24,199
Thank you, Daddy.

705
01:38:39,927 --> 01:38:41,918
Drinks.

706
01:38:41,963 --> 01:38:43,954
Take what you ordered.

707
01:38:43,998 --> 01:38:46,728
Don't take anybody else's drink.
What you ordered.

708
01:39:18,833 --> 01:39:22,200
We are here on day three
of what has come to be known...

709
01:39:22,236 --> 01:39:25,603
as the 'Lee Holloway Hunger Strike.'
You may have heard...

710
01:39:25,640 --> 01:39:27,972
that there are those
in the community who wonder...

711
01:39:28,009 --> 01:39:31,035
if Ms. Holloway is even willing
to starve herself to death.

712
01:39:35,416 --> 01:39:38,852
'In one way or another,
I've always suffered.

713
01:39:38,886 --> 01:39:41,582
I didn't know why, exactly.

714
01:39:41,622 --> 01:39:46,082
But I do know that I'm not
so scared of suffering now.

715
01:39:46,127 --> 01:39:49,153
I feeI more
than I've ever felt,...

716
01:39:49,196 --> 01:39:56,961
and I've found someone to feel with,
to pIay with, to love,...

717
01:39:57,004 --> 01:40:00,599
in a way that
feels right for me.

718
01:40:00,641 --> 01:40:04,543
I hope he knows that I can see
that he suffers too,...

719
01:40:04,578 --> 01:40:07,945
and that I want to love him.'

720
01:42:39,099 --> 01:42:46,430
Each cut, each scar, each burn,
a different mood or time.

721
01:42:46,474 --> 01:42:49,637
I told him
what the first one was.

722
01:42:49,677 --> 01:42:52,168
I told him
where the second one came from.

723
01:42:52,213 --> 01:42:54,909
I remembered them all.

724
01:42:54,949 --> 01:43:01,978
And for the first time in my life,
I felt beautiful.

725
01:43:02,022 --> 01:43:04,786
Finally part of the earth.

726
01:43:04,825 --> 01:43:10,720
I touched the soil
and he loved me back.

727
01:43:31,418 --> 01:43:34,046
Where did you go to high school?

728
01:43:37,391 --> 01:43:40,189
What was your mother like?

729
01:43:40,227 --> 01:43:43,060
What was her name?

730
01:43:47,101 --> 01:43:49,626
What did it say...

731
01:43:49,670 --> 01:43:53,003
under your senior
yearbook picture?

732
01:43:56,176 --> 01:43:59,441
Who was your first Iove?

733
01:44:02,550 --> 01:44:04,916
When did your heart...

734
01:44:04,952 --> 01:44:08,217
first get broken?

735
01:44:14,061 --> 01:44:16,894
Where were you born?

736
01:44:24,471 --> 01:44:26,803
Des Moines, Iowa.

737
01:44:47,061 --> 01:44:52,761
All our activities melted into
an everyday sort of life...

738
01:44:52,800 --> 01:44:56,292
until we looked like
any other couple you'd see.

739
01:44:56,337 --> 01:44:58,828
Pull it over, yes.

740
01:44:58,872 --> 01:45:01,705
Just pull it tight.

741
01:45:01,742 --> 01:45:06,669
Now these pillows
like to be stacked...

742
01:45:07,681 --> 01:45:11,139
largest to the smallest.

743
01:45:11,185 --> 01:45:16,097
We had a June wedding, by ourselves,
at the justice of the peace.

744
01:45:17,658 --> 01:45:20,923
Then we honeymooned
in the mountains.

745
01:45:20,961 --> 01:45:25,261
We only had the weekend, because
Edward had to get back to work.
