Yes, Miss Margaret.

490
00:37:28,012 --> 00:37:32,415
Sharon, what
I'm trying to say is that
the decision to marry...

491
00:37:32,483 --> 00:37:35,919
is something best considered
after you've lived
a little bit longer.

492
00:37:35,987 --> 00:37:40,481
Mother, you're perfectly right.
Stafford was much
too juvenile for me.

Well, thank goodness
for that.

the old zing just wasn't there.
- Zing?

up your spine when you meet
the one man you wanna marry.

Well... I don't know how
we got around to him.

to talk about Daddy?

when you've been in love
with somebody once,

and memory might be bitter--

many, many years ago.

00:44:59,129 --> 00:45:01,427
Well, did you tell her
anything about us?

591
00:45:12,943 --> 00:45:16,276
- Good to be home again?
- Sure is.

592
00:45:16,346 --> 00:45:20,578
Verbena, there's
a woman downstairs.

593
00:45:20,651 --> 00:45:23,211
Mm-hmm.
There is indeed.

594
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:28,350
Well, who is she?
What is she doing here?

595
00:45:28,425 --> 00:45:33,556
I'm not saying a word.
I mind my own business.

596
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:38,294
EXcept if he wants to make
a ninny of himself, that's his
affair. I don't say a word.

597
00:45:38,368 --> 00:45:42,099
- Well, how did she get here?
- It's none of my never mind.

I don't say a word.

''It was always thus.''

I'm not sayin' a word.

<i>I'm not sayin'a word,</i>

612
00:46:38,262 --> 00:46:42,358
Not one single word.
Besides, I don't think
you oughta talk about people--

613
00:46:56,613 --> 00:47:00,879
Hi, Susie. We were
just talking about you.
Uh, this is Miss Robinson.

614
00:47:00,951 --> 00:47:02,816
- How do you do?
- Hello, darling.

615
00:47:02,886 --> 00:47:05,855
I've been looking
forward to meeting you
for just weeks now.

616
00:47:05,923 --> 00:47:10,860
From the way your father talked,
I eXpected a little girl,
but you're practically a woman.

617
00:47:10,928 --> 00:47:15,422
- I'm nearly 1 <i>4.</i>
- Say, I think I'll go and make
martinis. You want one?

618
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:19,162
- Oh, I'd love one.
- Uh, how about you, honey?
You want root beer, ginger ale?

619
00:47:19,236 --> 00:47:23,730
- Could I have a ginger ale?
- Sure. You get acquainted.
I'll be just a minute.

620
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:28,574
- Your father tells me you were
at camp, dear. Was it fun?
- Yes, it was lovely. Thank you.

621
00:47:28,645 --> 00:47:33,048
You know, ever since
I met your father, it's been
''Susan this'' and ''Susan that.''

622
00:47:33,116 --> 00:47:36,643
You're obviously very
good friends, and I think
that's just wonderful.

623
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:40,383
I can, uh, tell you
something else too
if you can keep a secret.

624
00:47:40,457 --> 00:47:43,426
- From whom?
- From your father.

625
00:47:43,493 --> 00:47:46,951
Oh, then you
better not tell me.

626
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:49,624
Daddy and I don't keep secrets
from one another.

627
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:52,726
We tell each other
everything.

628
00:47:52,803 --> 00:47:57,172
Oh, well, no, dear.
It wasn't that kind of a secret.

629
00:47:57,241 --> 00:48:01,974
I just wanted to confide in you
that I find him a very special,
wonderful kind of person.

630
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:05,879
Well,just between us,

631
00:48:05,949 --> 00:48:09,715
he's not too brilliant
or clever with what he says,

632
00:48:09,786 --> 00:48:13,449
you know, like the ''charm fellows''
we all adore so.

633
00:48:13,523 --> 00:48:17,926
We were riding the other day.
Your father let me ride Schotzli.

634
00:48:17,995 --> 00:48:20,623
<i>I understand</i>
<i>she's your horse,</i>

635

I hope you don't mind
my riding her.

636
00:48:24,067 --> 00:48:26,035
Oh, no.

637
00:48:26,136 --> 00:48:30,004
Schotzli and I are used
to strange women riding her.

638
00:48:30,073 --> 00:48:32,974
<i>- What?</i>
- Oh, you know Daddy.

639
00:48:33,043 --> 00:48:35,637
He's always
playing the field.

640
00:48:35,712 --> 00:48:39,546
- No, I didn't know.
- Oh, yes.

641
00:48:39,616 --> 00:48:43,143
Every week mostly,
he has some different
dame up here.

642
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:45,950
One week,
I'll never forget,

643
00:48:46,023 --> 00:48:48,719
he had <i>five</i>
different women up here.

644
00:48:48,792 --> 00:48:52,626
- You don't say.
- Of course, it's none
of my business...

645
00:48:52,696 --> 00:48:56,393
if he wants to make a ninny
of himself with all those women.

646
00:48:56,466 --> 00:49:01,267
That's why I'm not saying
a word. Not one single word.

647
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:06,305
Here you are.
Now, did you two
get to know each other?

648
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:08,378
Yes.

649
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:11,881
We had a lovely
little talk.

- I got to talk to you
about their first date.
- Susan--

656
00:50:06,203 --> 00:50:09,570
-Italian dinner, drippy candles,
checkered tablecloth--
-Susan, will you listen?

657
00:50:09,639 --> 00:50:13,598
Ooh, I got their song.
It goes like this.
? For now, for always ?

- Susan, I've got
something to tell you.
- ? La-la, la-la, la-- ??

- Susan!
- What?

660
00:50:18,448 --> 00:50:21,178
We're in trouble.
You'll have to bring
Mother out immediately.

661
00:50:21,251 --> 00:50:25,449
No! Holy smokes,
I just had one day with her.
I hardly got to know her at all.

662
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:28,184
- Susan, it's an emergency.
There's a woman out here.
- Huh?

663
00:50:28,258 --> 00:50:30,192
Her name's Vicky,
and she's beautiful.

664
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:33,388
Oh, is that all? Don't be silly.
Dad'd never get serious.

665
00:50:33,463 --> 00:50:38,059
But he's serious about this one.
He's trying to get Vicky and me
to be friends. She's dangerous.

666
00:50:38,135 --> 00:50:40,330
Well, bust it up,
for heaven sakes!

667
00:50:40,404 --> 00:50:42,964
Follow him wherever he goes
and submarine her!

668
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:47,238
-You've got to tell Mother
and come out here to help!
-I want some more time with her.

669
00:50:47,344 --> 00:50:50,279
- You've had her for 1 3 years,
and I just got here!
- Susan!

670
00:50:50,347 --> 00:50:53,874
I won't! Do the best
you can and stay on
Daddy's tail. That's all!

- Susan, please.
- I won't give up Mother
this soon and that's final!

I'm glad you could come along
today, honey, because there's
something I wanna talk about.

675
00:51:13,937 --> 00:51:15,928

- Oh, what is it?

676
00:51:16,006 --> 00:51:19,635
- Well, you know the girl
you met at the house, Vicky?
- Mm-hmm.

677
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:24,510
Well, I thought that we ought
to be alone a little while
so we could talk.

678
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:29,644
- Well, I wanted to talk to you
about something too, Dad.
- Oh? Okay, go ahead.

679
00:51:29,719 --> 00:51:34,247
All those weeks at camp,
I've been wondering about my mother.

680

You what? What do you
wanna start wondering about
something like that for?

681
00:51:38,028 --> 00:51:42,397
Well, it's a perfectly
natural thing for a girl
to do. Where is she?

682
00:51:42,466 --> 00:51:44,661
Well, I don't know where she is.
How should I know?

683
00:51:44,734 --> 00:51:49,330
- Last thing I heard, she went
to Spain and married some drunk.
- Daddy, that's not true. Stop.

684
00:51:49,406 --> 00:51:52,375
All right. I lost track.
You wouldn't like her anyway, hon.

685
00:51:52,442 --> 00:51:55,775
She's-- These big staring eyes
and red frizzy hair.

686
00:51:55,846 --> 00:51:58,815
And besides,
she was fat, really fat.

687
00:51:58,915 --> 00:52:01,611
Then why did you
fall in love with her?

688
00:52:01,685 --> 00:52:05,143
Well, you know, you lose
your head sometimes.

689
00:52:05,222 --> 00:52:08,089
Besides that--
Wait just a minute.

Hey, Fletcher, play on through.
I'll pick you up at the bar.

don't wanna start thinkin' about

There's a-- Well,
there's no need for that.

694

You can always come and
talk to me about anything.
You always have.

695
00:52:31,214 --> 00:52:35,275
Well, it's not the same.
Well, father and daughter is okay.

696
00:52:35,352 --> 00:52:38,446
But when a girl gets
to a certain age,

697
00:52:38,522 --> 00:52:41,320
that's when she really
misses her mother.

698
00:52:42,792 --> 00:52:46,888
Why?
I mean, uh--

699

Oh, you mean the talk
about... certain things?

we never have just sat down and
talked about that, have we?

Well, this is kind of
an odd place, but I guess
it's as good as any.

- About what you were
just talking about?
- Nothing. Absolutely nothing!

the subject and I wondered why.
