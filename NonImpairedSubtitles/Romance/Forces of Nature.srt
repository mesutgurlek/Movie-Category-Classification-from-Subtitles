1
00:00:44,819 --> 00:00:48,531
It's a great pleasure-

2
00:00:48,573 --> 00:00:51,451
It's a great pleasure-

3
00:00:51,493 --> 00:00:57,040
It's a great pleasure to
have all of you here today.

4
00:01:01,211 --> 00:01:04,422
I thought you all might
begin your tour here.

5
00:01:10,971 --> 00:01:14,453
I really didn't want a bachelor
party in the first place.

6
00:01:14,488 --> 00:01:17,936
I'll tell you why. It's not
that I'm against tradition.

7
00:01:17,978 --> 00:01:21,731
There's just something bizarre about
having a strange, naked woman...

8
00:01:21,773 --> 00:01:24,234
dance around me while
my friends yell out,

9
00:01:24,276 --> 00:01:26,368
"Go for it, Ben.

10
00:01:26,403 --> 00:01:29,322
Last night of freedom, Ben. "

11
00:01:29,364 --> 00:01:32,207
Last night of freedom for what?

12
00:01:32,242 --> 00:01:35,245
Which is what I told
my best friend Alan.

13
00:01:35,287 --> 00:01:38,915
I didn't want any strippers.
I didn't wanna get lucky.

14
00:01:38,957 --> 00:01:41,960
I was lucky enough just getting married.

15
00:01:42,002 --> 00:01:45,088
All right. Quiet!

16
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:49,134
Guys!

17
00:01:49,175 --> 00:01:53,930
All right. I'm not payin' for
that. It already was chipped.

18
00:01:53,972 --> 00:01:58,768
We're here to, uh, wish Ben
good luck and good riddance...

19
00:01:58,803 --> 00:02:02,272
as he heads down that
rocky path to matrimony.

20
00:02:02,314 --> 00:02:04,322
And, uh, hey, you know what.

21
00:02:04,357 --> 00:02:07,819
Ben's dad Richard and his grandpa
Max are here. Where are you guys?

22
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:12,115
Those guys
- Watch out. You guys gotta pace yourselves.

23
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:15,493
Knowing Ben, I'd have to
say that he's probably,

24
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:20,332
- uh, one of the most loyal guys that I've ever met,
- Like a dog!

25
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:22,292
and, uh, monogamous.

26
00:02:22,334 --> 00:02:26,755
And so this is probably
gonna be the last time...

27
00:02:26,796 --> 00:02:29,716
that you're gonna spend in
a room with your friends...

28
00:02:29,758 --> 00:02:32,969
and a n-n-naked
woman...

29
00:02:33,011 --> 00:02:36,139
other than your wife, man!

30
00:02:36,181 --> 00:02:38,850
So you can close your eyes
if you want to. Close 'em!

31
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:43,980
But then you're gonna be
missin' Juanita, the bull tamer!

32
00:02:59,955 --> 00:03:03,416
You don't have to do this.

33
00:03:08,838 --> 00:03:11,508
You really don't have to do this.

34
00:03:27,482 --> 00:03:30,193
Very nice.

35
00:03:35,532 --> 00:03:39,035
Ole!

36
00:04:06,062 --> 00:04:08,356
Pop?

37
00:04:08,398 --> 00:04:10,609
Pop?

38
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:13,882
Pop? Max?

39
00:04:13,917 --> 00:04:17,115
Call 911.

40
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:28,216
How did this happen? Hmm?

41
00:04:28,251 --> 00:04:30,211
What's the difference how it happened?

42
00:04:30,253 --> 00:04:32,255
- I wanna know how it happened.
- It happened.

43
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:33,847
It makes a difference to me.

44
00:04:33,882 --> 00:04:35,884
All of a sudden he has a
heart attack out of no place?

45
00:04:35,926 --> 00:04:38,094
Mom, can we please not
talk about this now?

46
00:04:38,136 --> 00:04:40,221
What is it you don't want to talk about?

47
00:04:40,263 --> 00:04:44,017
Mrs. Holmes, if it's any consolation, I
think he was having a really good time.

48
00:04:44,059 --> 00:04:45,977
- Alan, shut up.
- Okay.

49
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:48,813
- Come into the hall.
- What is in the hall?

50
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:50,982
A vending machine. Come on, butchki.

51
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:54,027
- Who's hungry? I'm buying.
- All hours of the night-

52
00:04:54,069 --> 00:04:57,239
This is insane.

53
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,741
He probably just ate some spicy food.

54
00:04:59,783 --> 00:05:01,868
It was spicy, all right,
but it wasn't food.

55
00:05:01,903 --> 00:05:03,912
- Butchki!
- What?

56
00:05:03,954 --> 00:05:07,874
Richard, you are the silliest old tart.

57
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:10,835
Grandpa, what came over you?

58
00:05:10,877 --> 00:05:13,678
Hmm?

59
00:05:13,713 --> 00:05:16,925
- Hey.
- Ben.

60
00:05:16,967 --> 00:05:19,935
- You all right?
- Ben.

61
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:24,975
She was the most
beautiful woman I ever saw.

62
00:05:25,016 --> 00:05:27,686
What about Nana?

63
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:32,190
Did you ever take a good
look at your grandmother?

64
00:05:32,232 --> 00:05:35,026
Woman looked like Tolstoy.

65
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:38,321
I was never attracted to her.

66
00:05:38,363 --> 00:05:41,449
Oh, maybe in the beginning,

67
00:05:41,491 --> 00:05:45,203
because she was the only
woman I'd ever been with.

68
00:05:45,245 --> 00:05:49,833
Well, you know, that's great. That's, uh
- That's loyalty.

69
00:05:49,868 --> 00:05:52,294
Loyalty? It's fear.

70
00:05:52,335 --> 00:05:55,297
Did you ever feel her arms, her-

71
00:05:55,338 --> 00:05:59,342
Oh, Ben, I used to
dream about other women.

72
00:05:59,384 --> 00:06:03,346
What it would be like
to hold them and to-

73
00:06:03,388 --> 00:06:05,557
- Okay. - Touch
them and to-

74
00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:07,601
- That's- -
Smell them.

75
00:06:07,642 --> 00:06:11,396
Grandma smelled. She had a
very distinct smell. It was a-

76
00:06:11,438 --> 00:06:13,356
Ben. Ben.

77
00:06:15,025 --> 00:06:16,985
Listen to me.

78
00:06:17,027 --> 00:06:19,404
Don't tie yourself down.

79
00:06:19,446 --> 00:06:22,532
Even if you love a woman, it fades.

80
00:06:22,574 --> 00:06:26,578
Marriage is a prison.

81
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:30,707
Ben!

82
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:44,220
Could I help you out? Here we go.

83
00:06:44,262 --> 00:06:46,556
- You just passed my room.
- Sorry.

84
00:06:46,591 --> 00:06:48,391
Feel better.

85
00:06:48,426 --> 00:06:50,477
Hi.

86
00:06:50,602 --> 00:06:53,688
- Hi, sweetie.
- Honey.

87
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:59,236
Oh, why does everything feel so
much better now that you're here?

88
00:06:59,277 --> 00:07:01,529
- How's he doing?
- He's stable.

89
00:07:01,571 --> 00:07:04,074
- You know, physically, at least.
- Great.

90
00:07:04,109 --> 00:07:06,117
What happened?

91
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:09,788
What do you expect? He's an 80-year-old
man with high blood pressure...

92
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:14,918
and a naked balloon-popping
toreador is a rough combination.

93
00:07:14,953 --> 00:07:17,921
- It didn't pan out. It's not funny.
- It's not funny.

94
00:07:17,963 --> 00:07:21,132
- Be serious.
- There's something I want to do.

95
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:25,929
- Okay. Why? - I wanna be able to remember
this moment in 30 or 40 years.

96
00:07:25,971 --> 00:07:29,099
Think my next husband
will get a kick out of it.

97
00:07:29,134 --> 00:07:31,017
Oh, that's nice. Okay.

98
00:07:31,059 --> 00:07:35,855
It's the night before I am flying
down to Savannah for our wedding alone,

99
00:07:35,897 --> 00:07:41,361
because Ben's grandfather, who we
will now refer to as Larry Flynt,

100
00:07:41,403 --> 00:07:43,947
has partied himself into intensive care.

101
00:07:43,989 --> 00:07:47,701
- What do you have to say?
- Put the video camera away.

102
00:07:47,742 --> 00:07:51,371
No, no, no, honey, you're not
going to get off that easy.

103
00:07:51,413 --> 00:07:53,456
No, I'm saving it for my vows.

104
00:07:53,498 --> 00:07:56,001
I have already finished my vows.

105
00:07:56,036 --> 00:07:58,426
What's in 'em?

106
00:07:58,461 --> 00:08:01,590
You know why? Because it's
easy for you. I'm a writer.

107
00:08:01,631 --> 00:08:05,802
- Oh, really? - I can't just slap something
down on paper like you do.

108
00:08:05,837 --> 00:08:09,306
Ben, listen.

109
00:08:12,142 --> 00:08:15,895
You don't have to be brilliant...

110
00:08:15,937 --> 00:08:19,649
or witty or clever or polite even.

111
00:08:19,691 --> 00:08:23,278
Just have to be honest.

112
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,655
Come on. Say something.
What are you feeling?

113
00:08:25,697 --> 00:08:29,576
Are you nervous? Are you
happy? Are you scared?

114
00:08:29,611 --> 00:08:32,329
Am I scared? What would I be scared of?

115
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:37,334
- I'm scared.
- You are? Why? Now you're making me scared.

116
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:41,755
Because it's a big thing. It's our
marriage. It's the rest of our lives.

117
00:08:41,796 --> 00:08:44,215
It's
- It's scary.

118
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:48,059
I know. I'm not scared.

119
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:51,306
- The only thing we
have to tear- - Yeah?

120
00:08:51,348 --> 00:08:55,852
- Is this video camera.
- Hey! Come on! Just say a few words for posterity.

121
00:08:55,887 --> 00:09:01,149
What, what, what

122
00:09:01,983 --> 00:09:04,027
What

123
00:09:04,069 --> 00:09:07,697
What, what

124
00:09:07,739 --> 00:09:11,243
Follow me to the scene What

125
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:14,162
Really? You think I can
rent shoes down there?

126
00:09:14,204 --> 00:09:16,039
I can't believe I forgot my shoes.

127
00:09:16,081 --> 00:09:19,501
I hear they have shoes in Savannah
now. The whole South has 'em.

128
00:09:19,542 --> 00:09:22,087
All right. Wedding dress. Check.

129
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:24,554
Check for the minister. Check.

130
00:09:24,589 --> 00:09:26,967
Valium for Bridget's mother. Check.

131
00:09:27,008 --> 00:09:30,553
- Ball and chain for you. Check.
- Not listening to you. Check.

132
00:09:30,595 --> 00:09:33,848
- Here, look. Here you go.
- Thanks.

133
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:37,811
This is your present,
okay? It's a book of quotes.

134
00:09:37,852 --> 00:09:40,647
I crossed out the ones I'm
gonna use in my toast. Listen.

135
00:09:40,689 --> 00:09:43,441
"To say that you can love
one person all your life...

136
00:09:43,483 --> 00:09:48,697
is like saying that one candle will
continue to burn as long as you live. "

137
00:09:48,738 --> 00:09:52,242
- Think about that for a minute.
- I will. That's profound.

138
00:09:52,284 --> 00:09:54,202
This is used.

139
00:09:54,244 --> 00:09:57,747
I forgot the rings.

140
00:09:57,789 --> 00:10:01,167
That's not funny. No, don't do that.

141
00:10:01,209 --> 00:10:04,504
I forgot the rings, so-

142
00:10:04,539 --> 00:10:07,632
Come on, man! No!

143
00:10:07,674 --> 00:10:09,426
Relax. I'll catch the next plane.

144
00:10:09,467 --> 00:10:10,969
Son of a bitch!

145
00:10:11,011 --> 00:10:14,764
I'll see ya in Savannah.
Hey, I need to go to the city.

146
00:10:14,806 --> 00:10:16,725
- New York! New York City!
- No, I can't.

147
00:10:16,766 --> 00:10:21,354
Don't take the Van Wyck though.

148
00:10:35,619 --> 00:10:39,331
Hurricane Amanda is headed
for the Southeast coastline.

149
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:43,043
The eye of the hurricane is
presently located 200 miles...

150
00:10:43,078 --> 00:10:45,545
east of South Carolina
and Savannah, Georgia.

151
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:47,505
North, northwest-

152
00:11:09,736 --> 00:11:13,205
Excuse me, folks.

153
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:16,826
Just the line's movin' forward.

154
00:11:24,918 --> 00:11:28,922
No. Well, I love you.

155
00:11:28,957 --> 00:11:31,383
I love you more.

156
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:33,802
No, I love you more.

157
00:11:33,843 --> 00:11:36,471
No, you more.

158
00:11:36,513 --> 00:11:40,433
No, I love you more.

159
00:11:40,475 --> 00:11:43,603
Okay, I have to go, because I just
made another passenger nauseous.

160
00:11:43,645 --> 00:11:45,855
Okay?

161
00:11:45,897 --> 00:11:48,900
That's my fiancée.

162
00:11:48,942 --> 00:11:50,902
Goin' down to get
married, so we're a little-

163
00:11:50,944 --> 00:11:54,948
Oh! Jack Bealy, Snap-On Tools.

164
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:58,785
Ben Holmes, scared of flyin'.

165
00:11:58,827 --> 00:12:01,788
- Yeah, I was married once.
- Yeah?

166
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:04,791
To me marriage is just one big lie.

167
00:12:04,826 --> 00:12:06,591
You don't say.

168
00:12:06,626 --> 00:12:10,213
In the morning I had to
say, 'Don't be silly, honey.

169
00:12:10,248 --> 00:12:14,259
Your breath is fine.
You smell like a rose. "

170
00:12:14,301 --> 00:12:16,428
Then I had to say, '"No, honey.

171
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:19,104
I never noticed that
18-year-old girl...

172
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:24,060
with the fantastic body and halter
top that delivers our newspaper.

173
00:12:24,102 --> 00:12:27,355
She can't hold a candle to you...

174
00:12:27,397 --> 00:12:31,484
and the 30 pounds you've put on
since we stopped having sex. "

175
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:34,536
So when's the wedding day?

176
00:12:34,571 --> 00:12:37,157
May cancel it. I may have to call back.

177
00:12:37,198 --> 00:12:43,330
I didn't mean to throw a wet towel on
ya with my whole marital disaster tirade.

178
00:12:43,371 --> 00:12:45,540
It's all right. It was a nice story
actually. It was very touching.

179
00:12:45,582 --> 00:12:47,500
- Nice girl?
- Very nice.

180
00:12:47,626 --> 00:12:51,171
As a matter of fact, I just happen
to have a picture of her right here.

181
00:12:51,212 --> 00:12:53,423
- Wow, what a knockout.
- Yeah, she's beautiful.

182
00:12:53,465 --> 00:12:57,218
- Oh, baby, come to Daddy.
- Well, take it easy, Jack.

183
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:59,930
What I wouldn't give
for an ass like that.

184
00:13:02,223 --> 00:13:04,726
- Huh? Here we go.
- Hi.

185
00:13:04,768 --> 00:13:07,187
- This is me.
- Really?

186
00:13:07,229 --> 00:13:10,523
Well, this is your
lucky day, sweetheart.

187
00:13:10,565 --> 00:13:12,943
We got just about enough
room for one of you, darlin'.

188
00:13:12,984 --> 00:13:15,028
Must be destiny, huh?

189
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:16,863
- Careful.
- Okay.

190
00:13:16,905 --> 00:13:18,698
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

191
00:13:42,472 --> 00:13:44,606
- Sorry.
- Hmm?

192
00:13:44,641 --> 00:13:49,145
I was reading what you were writing. My
eye just kind of wandered over. Sorry.

193
00:13:49,187 --> 00:13:52,691
Do you work for Hallmark?

194
00:13:57,696 --> 00:14:01,992
Even if I had seen you looking
at it, that wouldn't bother me.

195
00:14:02,027 --> 00:14:04,035
Well, I don't care either.

196
00:14:04,077 --> 00:14:06,705
I'm absolutely fascinated you
can't admit you saw me reading it.

197
00:14:06,746 --> 00:14:09,374
If I had seen you reading it, I'd
be perfectly happy to admit it.

198
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:11,876
Then why did you close your computer?

199
00:14:11,918 --> 00:14:14,337
I'm known to do that from time to time.

200
00:14:14,379 --> 00:14:19,092
I'm a rebel. I'll open it, then
I'll close it again just like that.

201
00:14:19,127 --> 00:14:21,344
Don't get next to my fire,
because you'll get burned.

202
00:14:21,386 --> 00:14:23,395
This is not working properly.

203
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:26,641
Stewardess, this isn't
- Miss? Thank you.

204
00:14:26,683 --> 00:14:29,102
You're a little jumpy
for a rebel, aren't ya?

205
00:14:29,137 --> 00:14:31,021
My seat belt's not functioning properly.

206
00:14:31,062 --> 00:14:33,982
He's a scared flier.
Jack Bealy, Snap-On Tools.

207
00:14:34,024 --> 00:14:37,158
Sarah Lewis. And you are?

208
00:14:37,193 --> 00:14:40,739
Ben Holmes. Really, I'm not that scared.

209
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:45,535
- Jack's- - I can assure you
absolutely nothing is going to happen.

210
00:14:45,577 --> 00:14:50,373
I speak from experience. I was
a flight attendant. There you go.

211
00:14:50,408 --> 00:14:52,959
Oh, yeah? In one of
those little uniforms?

212
00:15:38,338 --> 00:15:41,007
Please stay calm!

213
00:15:41,042 --> 00:15:45,011
Oh, my God!

214
00:15:49,349 --> 00:15:51,768
Hold on!

215
00:16:06,157 --> 00:16:08,868
Oh, my God! This is a disaster.

216
00:16:10,453 --> 00:16:13,331
- Daddy.
- Oh, for heaven sake.

217
00:16:13,373 --> 00:16:16,126
- Let's go live- -
On the other hand,

218
00:16:16,167 --> 00:16:18,837
you can never have too many of these.

219
00:16:18,878 --> 00:16:21,381
- It's fabulously colorful.
- Give you that.

220
00:16:21,423 --> 00:16:23,258
How tar do you think I could throw it?

221
00:16:23,383 --> 00:16:25,302
Don't you dare, young
- Give me that now.

222
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:27,304
To the hospital for minor injuries.

223
00:16:27,345 --> 00:16:29,354
Ceramic clown from the?

224
00:16:29,389 --> 00:16:33,108
- Brewsters.
- My God! That's Ben!

225
00:16:33,143 --> 00:16:35,145
There's no official word
on the cause of the crash.

226
00:16:35,186 --> 00:16:37,439
There may have been a foreign object-

227
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,858
Let's get some help!

228
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:42,193
She hit her head.

229
00:16:42,235 --> 00:16:44,279
Everyone's pretty shook up.

230
00:16:44,321 --> 00:16:47,866
We had a couple of passengers go to
a local hospital with concussions.

231
00:16:47,908 --> 00:16:50,702
Oh, my God. There he is again.

232
00:16:50,744 --> 00:16:53,496
Call me! Oh, Ben! I love you.

233
00:16:53,538 --> 00:16:55,874
Call me! No. Go back.

234
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:58,084
There you have it.
The latest information-

235
00:17:00,378 --> 00:17:02,839
Hello? Ah, Ben!

236
00:17:02,881 --> 00:17:06,343
Hi, honey. Yeah, I'm fine. No, I'm okay.

237
00:17:06,378 --> 00:17:08,887
I'm a little frazzled.

238
00:17:08,929 --> 00:17:11,014
I mean, I was in a plane crash.

239
00:17:11,056 --> 00:17:13,982
This place is a nightmare.

240
00:17:14,017 --> 00:17:18,063
People are running around.
I guess they lost everything.

241
00:17:18,104 --> 00:17:21,650
I don't care about any of that.
I'm just so happy you're okay.

242
00:17:21,691 --> 00:17:24,409
I- I-I just
wish that-

243
00:17:24,444 --> 00:17:27,329
- Ben! Ben, listen.
- Tell him, um-

244
00:17:27,364 --> 00:17:30,784
- What happened?
- You just get yourself down here sate and sound.

245
00:17:30,825 --> 00:17:35,622
The thing is, I'm a little bit scared
to fly before I was in a plane crash,

246
00:17:35,664 --> 00:17:37,916
so I don't feel much like getting-

247
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:40,502
- Jesus!
- You are a god.

248
00:17:40,543 --> 00:17:44,798
- You are a god amongst all men. Do you realize that?
- I'm on the phone.

249
00:17:44,839 --> 00:17:46,514
- Sorry.
- Do you mind?

250
00:17:46,549 --> 00:17:50,136
- What in the hell?
- Just one of the passengers.

251
00:17:50,171 --> 00:17:52,222
- He saved my life!
- She's kidding.

252
00:17:52,257 --> 00:17:53,640
It's a joke.

253
00:17:53,682 --> 00:17:57,185
I'm gonna get a rental car
and drive down there, okay?

254
00:17:57,227 --> 00:18:00,313
I'll call you w-w-when
I have a finalized plan.

255
00:18:00,355 --> 00:18:02,524
Okay, great. Thank you, sir.

256
00:18:09,197 --> 00:18:11,908
Sorry. I couldn't contain myself.

257
00:18:13,577 --> 00:18:16,663
It's amazing when you think about
it. We almost died today. Dead.

258
00:18:16,705 --> 00:18:19,749
Isn't there a rent-a-car this
way? Are we goin' the right way?

259
00:18:19,784 --> 00:18:22,711
It I died, how many people would care?

260
00:18:22,752 --> 00:18:26,381
I mean, really care. You'd have
your shares of "What a shame.

261
00:18:26,423 --> 00:18:28,550
What a waste. She was so young. "

262
00:18:28,592 --> 00:18:30,677
- But no real crying.
- It might be in that terminal.

263
00:18:30,719 --> 00:18:34,222
No eating disorders,
no attempted suicides.

264
00:18:34,264 --> 00:18:36,891
Nothing. Absolutely depressed.

265
00:18:36,933 --> 00:18:40,103
You know what? I'm thoroughly depressed.

266
00:18:40,145 --> 00:18:42,647
I just need to shake it off.

267
00:18:42,689 --> 00:18:45,115
So what were you thinking?

268
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:50,363
I was thinking how it would
affect our frequent flier miles.

269
00:18:50,405 --> 00:18:53,074
What do you do for a living?

270
00:18:53,116 --> 00:18:55,869
I'm a, uh, jacket copywriter.

271
00:18:55,911 --> 00:18:58,580
Huh. What does that mean?

272
00:18:58,622 --> 00:19:02,500
- Means I write jackets to books basically.
- Oh.

273
00:19:02,535 --> 00:19:05,253
Do mostly fiction, but
I do some nonfiction.

274
00:19:05,295 --> 00:19:08,548
You do blurbs. You're a blurb
writer. You're a "blurbologist. "

275
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:10,467
I'm a jacket copywriter.

276
00:19:10,508 --> 00:19:12,677
As you can imagine,

277
00:19:12,719 --> 00:19:15,013
- due to today's minor
incident- - Oh, sh-

278
00:19:18,975 --> 00:19:22,562
Nada cars. Non cars. Cars nyet.

279
00:19:22,604 --> 00:19:25,106
You should have called as
soon as you got off the plane.

280
00:19:25,148 --> 00:19:27,609
Why didn't I think of that
when I was unconscious...

281
00:19:27,651 --> 00:19:30,946
and bleeding from the head?

282
00:19:33,323 --> 00:19:37,202
So, cars nyet. We can check
the other airports though.

283
00:19:37,244 --> 00:19:39,127
No, that's all right. You can go ahead.

284
00:19:39,162 --> 00:19:42,749
I'm not that big a fan of the idea
of getting on another plane today...

285
00:19:42,784 --> 00:19:45,210
or tomorrow or ever, it that soon.

286
00:19:45,252 --> 00:19:49,589
But you go ahead. I think I'm gonna be a
ground transportation kind of guy from now on.

287
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:51,508
I'll be right back.

288
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:55,262
How ya doin'? Did ya get a car?

289
00:19:56,930 --> 00:20:01,101
- This is Vic. He's gonna give us a ride.
- All the way to Georgia?

290
00:20:01,136 --> 00:20:06,106
Sure. We split the cost of
the car, the gas, whatever.

291
00:20:06,141 --> 00:20:08,149
- Great.
- Good. Let's go.

292
00:20:08,191 --> 00:20:10,860
- Okay.
- Wait, wait, wait. We don't even know this guy.

293
00:20:10,902 --> 00:20:13,745
- He's Vic.
- Oh, he's Vic.

294
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:18,034
Great, he's Vic. He chops us
up, leaves us in the woods.

295
00:20:18,076 --> 00:20:22,247
That's why I asked that you
come along to protect me.

296
00:20:22,289 --> 00:20:25,792
How do you know that I'm not dangerous?

297
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:37,887
I said, hallelujah to the 16 royal fins

298
00:20:37,929 --> 00:20:40,390
You're gettin' down on your knees

299
00:20:40,432 --> 00:20:42,767
And it's time for your sickness again

300
00:20:42,809 --> 00:20:45,061
Come on and tell me what you need now

301
00:20:45,103 --> 00:20:47,856
Tell me what is making ya bleed

302
00:20:47,898 --> 00:20:52,694
We got two more minutes sayin'
we're gonna cut you what you need

303
00:20:53,945 --> 00:20:56,531
What's your story, Ben?
What's down in Savannah?

304
00:20:56,573 --> 00:20:58,867
- My wedding, Vic.
- No kiddin'. That's great.

305
00:20:58,909 --> 00:21:01,620
- Isn't that great?
- Yeah, it's a blessing.

306
00:21:01,661 --> 00:21:04,372
- First marriage?
- That I know of, yeah.

307
00:21:04,414 --> 00:21:07,792
Yeah, I was married once.

308
00:21:07,834 --> 00:21:10,712
One day I walk into the house
and I hear the shower runnin'.

309
00:21:10,754 --> 00:21:14,507
I had Chinese food with me, figurin'
it would be a nice romantic surprise.

310
00:21:14,542 --> 00:21:16,426
She starts singin' in the shower.

311
00:21:16,468 --> 00:21:20,180
What's that song? "Up in the
sky"? "Up with the eagles"?

312
00:21:20,221 --> 00:21:23,642
- '"Wind Beneath My Wings. " Very touching song.
- "Wind Beneath My Wings. "

313
00:21:23,683 --> 00:21:27,437
Suddenly there's another
voice in the shower with her.

314
00:21:27,472 --> 00:21:29,522
- Oh, no.
- A baritone.

315
00:21:29,557 --> 00:21:31,650
Uh-oh.

316
00:21:31,691 --> 00:21:33,735
Now it's a freakin' duet.

317
00:21:33,777 --> 00:21:37,072
So I walk in the bathroom and
there she is... with my brother.

318
00:21:37,113 --> 00:21:40,867
- Oh! - I grab my brother and throw
him through the window naked.

319
00:21:40,909 --> 00:21:43,870
He broke his leg in
two different places.

320
00:21:43,912 --> 00:21:46,665
Dare we ask what, uh,
became of your wife?

321
00:21:46,706 --> 00:21:50,043
I put the wind beneath her ass
and sent her packin'. Divorced her.

322
00:21:50,085 --> 00:21:55,131
She never got a penny, the
lyin', whorin', adulteratin' pig.

323
00:21:55,173 --> 00:21:57,717
What about you, sweetheart?
What's your story?

324
00:21:57,759 --> 00:22:01,721
I'm going down to visit my brother
and hang out with my nephew.

325
00:22:01,763 --> 00:22:03,890
That's nice. Kids.

326
00:22:03,932 --> 00:22:08,812
- Yep. Got any?
- Nah. But I see 'em all over.

327
00:22:08,853 --> 00:22:11,398
Come on, come on

328
00:22:14,025 --> 00:22:17,827
So what else have you
jacket copywritten?

329
00:22:17,862 --> 00:22:21,825
What else did I do? The low
point of my career was...

330
00:22:21,866 --> 00:22:24,995
I did the blurb for a thriller...

331
00:22:25,036 --> 00:22:28,039
about a woman-
an archaeologist-

332
00:22:28,081 --> 00:22:30,667
who finds love in the pyramids.

333
00:22:30,709 --> 00:22:33,044
It was called Me And My Pharaoh.

334
00:22:33,086 --> 00:22:35,380
- I have that book.
- No, you don't.

335
00:22:35,422 --> 00:22:40,010
Yes, I do. "A scintillating
tale of erotic mummification. "

336
00:22:40,045 --> 00:22:41,928
I wrote that line.

337
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:44,431
Oh, my God! That's
why I bought the book.

338
00:22:44,472 --> 00:22:48,935
Anybody who could find embalming
either scintillating or erotic...

339
00:22:48,977 --> 00:22:50,812
had to be read.

340
00:22:50,854 --> 00:22:54,774
- It was brilliant.
- Well, you know, I mean, it's all about adjectives.

341
00:22:54,816 --> 00:22:58,778
I was gonna go with "engaging tale
of erotic mummification" first.

342
00:22:58,813 --> 00:23:01,156
- But then I said, no, scintillating.
- Right on the money.

343
00:23:01,197 --> 00:23:05,327
It's still selling now,
but at least I get to write.

344
00:23:05,368 --> 00:23:07,370
What do you do?

345
00:23:07,412 --> 00:23:11,333
I haven't settled down to
one particular thing yet.

346
00:23:11,374 --> 00:23:15,211
Worked at galleries, sold cars,
tried out for "Aladdin On Ice. "

347
00:23:15,253 --> 00:23:18,513
Um, wedding videographer.

348
00:23:18,548 --> 00:23:21,801
I got fired, though, because
apparently nobody wants a crash zoom...

349
00:23:21,843 --> 00:23:24,679
to the priest during the ceremony.

350
00:23:24,721 --> 00:23:29,226
I was a exotic dancer, hostess
at the New York auto show.

351
00:23:29,261 --> 00:23:31,519
- That's a gift.
- Yeah.

352
00:23:31,561 --> 00:23:33,647
Let's see. What else?

353
00:23:33,688 --> 00:23:36,858
- Is there anything else?
- I don't think so.

354
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:40,028
- Kids, we should get goin'.
- You got it, Vic.

355
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:44,824
Two wayward travelers stuck
in a Geo with a guy named Vic.

356
00:23:47,869 --> 00:23:51,414
Don't you think this is just
a little bit over the top?

357
00:23:51,456 --> 00:23:53,291
Oh, so what if it is?

358
00:23:53,333 --> 00:23:55,168
Knock, knock.

359
00:23:55,252 --> 00:23:59,798
- Steve! How are you?
- I'm good, real good.

360
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:04,344
- Virginia, nice to see ya.
- Well, hi, Steve.

361
00:24:04,386 --> 00:24:06,179
Bridget.

362
00:24:06,221 --> 00:24:09,849
Yes. I mean, hi. Hi.

363
00:24:09,891 --> 00:24:13,270
Steve? How are you?

364
00:24:13,311 --> 00:24:16,022
- It's been a long time.
- Yeah.

365
00:24:16,064 --> 00:24:18,483
You look wonderful.

366
00:24:18,525 --> 00:24:20,902
Thank you. So do you.

367
00:24:20,944 --> 00:24:24,322
- So, how are you?
- How is he?

368
00:24:24,364 --> 00:24:27,367
Just the most successful
lawyer in Savannah. That's how.

369
00:24:27,409 --> 00:24:29,834
Youngest member at his
firm. Handles all my work.

370
00:24:29,869 --> 00:24:34,583
Which I appreciate, 'cause there's not a
contractor who gets sued more than your daddy.

371
00:24:34,624 --> 00:24:38,128
And what's so funny about that, Hadley?

372
00:24:38,169 --> 00:24:41,423
God, you are an unpleasant woman.

373
00:24:41,464 --> 00:24:45,135
Gale force winds it the hurricane
stays on course for Savannah.

374
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:48,186
Anybody want some weed?

375
00:24:48,221 --> 00:24:52,726
The experiment was a complete
failure. The U.F.O. landed-

376
00:24:52,767 --> 00:24:57,779
It's sinsemilla. It’ll
take your head right off.

377
00:24:57,814 --> 00:25:02,819
That's great, Vic. You think you should
have your head taken off while driving?

378
00:25:02,861 --> 00:25:04,946
- Can I have some?
- Atta girl.

379
00:25:04,988 --> 00:25:06,955
You sure you don't want, Ben?

380
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:10,702
No, that's okay. I had some
peyote for lunch, so I'm all set.

381
00:25:10,744 --> 00:25:14,414
He's getting married. Don't
forget. He has to be responsible.

382
00:25:14,456 --> 00:25:17,834
Not necessarily. You know,
look at the Fitzgeralds.

383
00:25:17,876 --> 00:25:20,879
F. Scott and Zelda,
crazy, married couple.

384
00:25:20,921 --> 00:25:23,924
They drove a-

385
00:25:24,841 --> 00:25:28,553
Had to know about that.

386
00:25:28,595 --> 00:25:30,847
- Whoa! Hey!
- Sorry. Sorry.

387
00:25:30,889 --> 00:25:35,185
Oh, shit!

388
00:25:42,275 --> 00:25:45,327
Uh, what's that?

389
00:25:45,362 --> 00:25:47,447
- Do you hear that?
- What's what?

390
00:25:49,866 --> 00:25:53,370
Hi, honey. How are the
bridesmaids' dresses comin' out?

391
00:25:53,411 --> 00:25:57,874
Good. No, everything's tine. I
just got a little bit delayed.

392
00:25:57,916 --> 00:26:00,710
Car trouble, in a manner of speaking.

393
00:26:00,752 --> 00:26:03,546
But I'm fine.
Everything's gonna be okay.

394
00:26:03,581 --> 00:26:08,093
Yes, I know. Well, I love you too.

395
00:26:08,134 --> 00:26:12,437
Well, hoo-hoochie, I love you so much.

396
00:26:12,472 --> 00:26:15,392
Baby, no, because I love
you more. I love you more-

397
00:26:15,433 --> 00:26:18,311
Honey, I can't do this right now.

398
00:26:20,397 --> 00:26:24,234
- I'm gonna miss my wedding.
- Oh, relax, Benjie.

399
00:26:24,276 --> 00:26:27,279
It's a simple drug bust. It's
not like we killed anybody.

400
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:31,366
This may be an everyday event in your
life, but speaking as a non-felon-

401
00:26:31,408 --> 00:26:33,708
I'm on a bit of a time
crunch here, too, okay?

402
00:26:33,743 --> 00:26:37,789
If I don't make it down to Savannah by
Saturday morning, I lose 25,000 bucks.

403
00:26:37,831 --> 00:26:42,919
Are you on Dig For Dollars? You told me you
were going to visit your brother and nephew.

404
00:26:42,961 --> 00:26:45,297
Yeah, I know.

405
00:26:45,338 --> 00:26:47,382
Okay, kids. Here's the situation.

406
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:50,093
Vic DeFranco was driving
with an expired license.

407
00:26:50,135 --> 00:26:52,345
Plus he's got three priors
for possession and selling.

408
00:26:52,429 --> 00:26:57,642
And there was ten ounces in the
vehicle that he admits is his.

409
00:26:57,684 --> 00:27:00,437
Did anybody else know
there were drugs in the car?

410
00:27:00,478 --> 00:27:02,904
- No, sir. In fact, I just
met this man- - You can't-

411
00:27:02,939 --> 00:27:05,567
You can't ask us these questions
without an attorney present.

412
00:27:05,609 --> 00:27:08,069
You haven't advised us of our rights.

413
00:27:08,111 --> 00:27:10,655
I believe that's called-

414
00:27:10,697 --> 00:27:14,326
Oh
- Ah! A Miranda violation. That's it.

415
00:27:14,367 --> 00:27:17,085
This is a very simple procedure.

416
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:23,084
You tell me you didn't do anything illegal.
you sign a statement. And you go quietly.

417
00:27:23,126 --> 00:27:26,212
Sir, I'd like to be considered
separate from her, sir.

418
00:27:28,924 --> 00:27:32,802
- Hmm. What part of quiet didn't you understand?
- What are you doing?

419
00:27:32,837 --> 00:27:34,721
Why me?

420
00:27:34,763 --> 00:27:39,434
Well, I think that went well.

421
00:27:39,476 --> 00:27:43,230
- I'm not that happy with how that went.
- No?

422
00:27:43,265 --> 00:27:45,148
No, not really.

423
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:49,110
I haven't known you that long, but I
think something may be wrong with you.

424
00:27:49,152 --> 00:27:53,114
- May we have two tickets
to Savannah, please?

425
00:27:53,156 --> 00:27:55,200
You want these seats together?

426
00:27:59,371 --> 00:28:02,791
It's totally up to you.

427
00:28:02,832 --> 00:28:07,837
- Just give me one second. Can I talk to you?
- Yeah.

428
00:28:07,872 --> 00:28:11,383
I just, uh
- I don't want to be rude or anything,

429
00:28:11,424 --> 00:28:14,928
but in situations like
this, I think about...

430
00:28:15,011 --> 00:28:18,348
what I would want Bridget to do
it the situation were reversed.

431
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:22,018
I wouldn't necessarily be
that comfortable with her...

432
00:28:22,053 --> 00:28:25,647
riding down on a train
together with some guy...

433
00:28:25,689 --> 00:28:29,276
who she had a, you know,
kind of a connection...

434
00:28:29,317 --> 00:28:33,530
or a chemistry or spark,

435
00:28:33,572 --> 00:28:35,949
whatever, some kind
of a thing like that.

436
00:28:35,991 --> 00:28:38,243
You know, and-

437
00:28:38,285 --> 00:28:42,122
The look on your face is
telling me you have no-

438
00:28:42,163 --> 00:28:45,208
You're not feeling
or you're not sensing-

439
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:50,672
- You have no idea what I'm-
- Oh, no, no, not really.

440
00:28:50,714 --> 00:28:53,758
Fascinating. Okay.

441
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,177
Maybe we just shouldn't
ride down together,

442
00:28:56,219 --> 00:29:00,265
because at this point I really
made kind of a chump out of myself.

443
00:29:00,307 --> 00:29:03,859
Okay.

444
00:29:03,894 --> 00:29:06,897
- Have a nice nuptial.
- Thank you.

445
00:29:06,938 --> 00:29:10,567
Other than the drug bust and
the plane crash, it was, uh, tun.

446
00:29:10,609 --> 00:29:13,278
So long, Sarah.

447
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,697
- Farewell, Ben.
- Okay.

448
00:29:20,076 --> 00:29:23,163
'Oscar Wilde: One
should always be in love.

449
00:29:23,204 --> 00:29:26,249
This is the reason one
should never marry. "

450
00:29:26,284 --> 00:29:29,753
Well, what did he know?

451
00:29:46,269 --> 00:29:49,231
What you writing there, mister?

452
00:29:49,272 --> 00:29:52,692
My wedding vows actually. My
fiancée and I are writing our own.

453
00:29:52,734 --> 00:29:54,653
Oh, that's sweet.
Isn't that sweet, Emma?

454
00:29:54,694 --> 00:29:58,240
- It's sweet as pie.
- We didn't write our own vows.

455
00:29:58,281 --> 00:30:01,743
It's kind of a new thing.
It's nontraditionalist.

456
00:30:01,785 --> 00:30:05,830
We were so nervous. It was hard
enough to do what the preacher told us.

457
00:30:05,872 --> 00:30:12,003
I didn't really think about it at all. It
just seemed natural, the order of things.

458
00:30:12,045 --> 00:30:14,763
I had doubts. I'll be honest.

459
00:30:14,798 --> 00:30:19,803
- You did? You never told me that.
- I don't tell you everything.

460
00:30:19,844 --> 00:30:22,270
You better, you old geezer.

461
00:30:22,305 --> 00:30:25,475
It seems like it worked out
pretty well for both of you.

462
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:28,144
Oh, we're not married.
We're having an affair.

463
00:30:28,186 --> 00:30:31,565
I'm happy for the
first time in 34 years.

464
00:30:31,606 --> 00:30:34,901
- I don't believe this.
- I don't have any regrets.

465
00:30:34,943 --> 00:30:39,322
My children are long gone, and
I gave my wife 30 faithful years.

466
00:30:39,364 --> 00:30:42,117
Until I met Ned, I
always was convinced...

467
00:30:42,158 --> 00:30:45,370
that sex was some horrible
obligation God put on women...

468
00:30:45,412 --> 00:30:48,039
like cramps or high heels.

469
00:30:48,081 --> 00:30:51,626
For all those years, she never
experienced a genuine orgasm.

470
00:30:51,668 --> 00:30:54,546
Wonderful. Could you watch my stuff?

471
00:30:54,588 --> 00:30:57,465
I'm gonna go pull the emergency cord.

472
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:09,894
- Hi. How are you?
- Hi.

473
00:31:09,929 --> 00:31:12,439
- Truck.
- What do you have?

474
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:17,360
A truck? Can I see? Hey,
hey, let me see your truck.

475
00:31:17,402 --> 00:31:21,197
- Grab my nose. Oh!
- Grab nose.

476
00:31:21,239 --> 00:31:24,743
What are you doin'?

477
00:31:24,784 --> 00:31:27,704
What are you doin'? Slap
me five. Slap me five.

478
00:31:27,746 --> 00:31:29,706
- Five!
- Slap me five.

479
00:31:33,126 --> 00:31:37,881
Something's wrong. He
should have called by now.

480
00:31:37,923 --> 00:31:40,592
He can take care of himself.
He's a grown man, isn't he?

481
00:31:40,634 --> 00:31:43,184
Daddy, what is it exactly
that you don't like about Ben,

482
00:31:43,219 --> 00:31:46,556
besides the tact that he's from
New York and he voted for Clinton?

483
00:31:46,598 --> 00:31:49,601
- That's not enough?
- I voted for Clinton.

484
00:31:49,643 --> 00:31:51,686
All the best presidents sleep around.

485
00:31:51,728 --> 00:31:55,280
Help.

486
00:31:55,315 --> 00:31:58,443
Hello? Oh, hi, Steve.

487
00:31:58,485 --> 00:32:00,403
Ooh.

488
00:32:00,445 --> 00:32:06,493
Oh, nothing, just, uh, you know,
staving oft a nervous break down.

489
00:32:06,534 --> 00:32:09,287
Oh, well, thank you, but I can't.

490
00:32:09,329 --> 00:32:11,873
No. No, no, it does.
It does sound like fun.

491
00:32:11,915 --> 00:32:14,209
But quite frankly, a series of
rabies shots sounds like tun...

492
00:32:14,251 --> 00:32:16,134
compared to another
evening with these two.

493
00:32:16,169 --> 00:32:19,339
Bridget, come watch the biography
of Newt with me. He's amazing!

494
00:32:19,374 --> 00:32:21,383
He is not. He's an imbecile.

495
00:32:21,424 --> 00:32:24,094
- No, he's not. He's a damn genius.
- Well, then, you're an imbecile.

496
00:32:24,135 --> 00:32:26,179
Maybe I can come by
for just a little while.

497
00:32:34,771 --> 00:32:37,273
The train will be underway momentarily.

498
00:32:37,308 --> 00:32:39,776
We apologize for the inconvenience.

499
00:32:39,811 --> 00:32:44,531
Hello!

500
00:32:46,449 --> 00:32:49,918
Can you hear me?

501
00:32:49,953 --> 00:32:53,164
Is anybody out there?

502
00:32:53,206 --> 00:32:58,295
No, but leave a message,
and we'll call you back!

503
00:32:58,336 --> 00:33:01,923
Hi.

504
00:33:01,965 --> 00:33:04,009
I wasn't expecting an answer.

505
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:07,387
I wasn't expecting to find
some crazy woman on the roof.

506
00:33:07,429 --> 00:33:09,347
Wanna come up?

507
00:33:09,389 --> 00:33:14,436
No, not really. I think probably that
the top of the train might be off-limits.

508
00:33:14,477 --> 00:33:19,482
I know. How many times in your life
you gonna see a view like this? Come on.

509
00:33:19,524 --> 00:33:22,360
Seize the moment, Benjie. Come on.

510
00:33:22,402 --> 00:33:25,322
I am. I'm eye level
with the sunset here,

511
00:33:25,363 --> 00:33:28,241
so I have a better view because I'm-

512
00:33:28,283 --> 00:33:31,369
Come up.

513
00:33:34,581 --> 00:33:39,002
Okay, buddy, this time, we're gonna
do it with a little more feeling.

514
00:33:39,037 --> 00:33:40,837
- Okay. - We're
just gonna-

515
00:33:40,879 --> 00:33:43,423
Echo!

516
00:33:43,465 --> 00:33:46,551
I am alive!

517
00:33:46,593 --> 00:33:48,637
Just a little
- Open. Just push out.

518
00:33:48,678 --> 00:33:54,434
Push out. No one can hear
you. Just throw it out there.

519
00:33:54,469 --> 00:33:57,771
I am somebody!

520
00:33:59,606 --> 00:34:02,073
- I think-
- Oh, God.

521
00:34:02,108 --> 00:34:05,028
I think He heard me.
Excuse me. I'm fine.

522
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:07,948
Let me show you how
I do it. Okay, ready?

523
00:34:09,950 --> 00:34:12,369
All right, here we go.

524
00:34:24,965 --> 00:34:28,969
Oh, God!

525
00:34:29,010 --> 00:34:32,973
Stella!

526
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:40,564
Well, that was nice. You
know, I mean, as sunsets go.

527
00:34:40,605 --> 00:34:43,900
This is interesting. I don't
remember the rooster car.

528
00:34:43,942 --> 00:34:48,947
- Do you remember seeing roosters?
- No, I'm a vegetarian.

529
00:34:50,907 --> 00:34:55,078
Oh, no, not again. Didn't
you two hear the announcement?

530
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:57,455
When we stop outside Youngsville,

531
00:34:57,497 --> 00:35:02,085
no one on the Savannah-bound train is
supposed to board the last three cars.

532
00:35:02,127 --> 00:35:06,464
- We uncouple there, and then we reroute.
- What does that mean?

533
00:35:06,506 --> 00:35:08,967
That means this train's
going to Chicago.

534
00:35:09,009 --> 00:35:11,011
Aah!

535
00:35:11,052 --> 00:35:13,722
I got you. I got you.

536
00:35:13,763 --> 00:35:16,474
You try to seize the moment, you
end up getting yourself killed.

537
00:35:16,516 --> 00:35:19,185
- Will you jump? It's not going that fast.
- It's too fast!

538
00:35:19,227 --> 00:35:22,063
I got you. I got you. There you go.

539
00:35:22,105 --> 00:35:26,610
There's another one coming tomorrow
afternoon, or there's a bus station in town.

540
00:35:26,645 --> 00:35:28,945
Okay, thanks!

541
00:35:28,987 --> 00:35:34,618
I'm starting to get the feeling that there's
maybe a hint that I'm not getting here.

542
00:35:34,659 --> 00:35:39,080
Just spell it out for me!

543
00:35:39,122 --> 00:35:42,459
- That pretty much spell it out for ya?
- I'd say it does.

544
00:35:57,891 --> 00:36:00,852
Whoo! Yeah! Whoo!

545
00:36:00,894 --> 00:36:04,231
Hey! Come on! What are you doing?

546
00:36:04,272 --> 00:36:07,651
- Oh! Come on!
- Oh!

547
00:36:11,655 --> 00:36:16,374
Whee!

548
00:36:16,409 --> 00:36:20,545
Oh, come on!

549
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:24,334
Ah! It kills. It kills. Ah!

550
00:36:24,376 --> 00:36:27,087
Ow!

551
00:36:29,256 --> 00:36:31,675
- Not exactly a hub city, I guess.
- No!

552
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:33,892
But we'll come back in the morning.

553
00:36:33,927 --> 00:36:36,304
- What do we do for the next 12 hours?
- Come on.

554
00:36:36,346 --> 00:36:41,434
- I have an instinct about these things.
- No! It's hailing! No!

555
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:48,400
How are you?

556
00:36:48,441 --> 00:36:50,443
It's so good to see you!

557
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:57,492
- You gotta see Linda. Remember Linda?
- Hi!

558
00:36:57,534 --> 00:37:01,496
Hey, you guys, look who came.
Bridget's getting married this weekend.

559
00:37:03,957 --> 00:37:08,628
Hey, hey, hey, hey

560
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:12,716
- Ouch! It kills! It kills!
- Hey, hey, hey, hey

561
00:37:12,757 --> 00:37:15,809
Oh! Oh, man!

562
00:37:15,844 --> 00:37:19,931
- It's open 24 hours.
- What are you doing? No, no, hey.

563
00:37:19,973 --> 00:37:22,350
Benjie, they cannot kick us out.

564
00:37:22,392 --> 00:37:25,395
- Please, get up.
- Oh, God!

565
00:37:25,437 --> 00:37:28,231
I love this place so much.

566
00:37:28,273 --> 00:37:31,192
- Oh! Oh!
- This is dry. It's the best thing I can say.

567
00:37:31,234 --> 00:37:35,113
Oh, my God, this is heaven.

568
00:37:35,155 --> 00:37:40,493
Baby has an old witch
doll My baby rang his bell

569
00:37:45,999 --> 00:37:50,170
I didn't have the time to
tell my baby fare you well

570
00:37:50,211 --> 00:37:54,007
Hey, hey, hey, hey

571
00:38:04,351 --> 00:38:07,187
Takes him down.

572
00:38:08,855 --> 00:38:11,733
I just wish we'd stayed in touch.

573
00:38:11,775 --> 00:38:15,528
- I regret not keeping the friendship going.
- We're friends.

574
00:38:15,563 --> 00:38:19,074
Steve, friends.

575
00:38:19,115 --> 00:38:22,577
I regret that too.

576
00:38:29,292 --> 00:38:33,338
How can I just let you walk away

577
00:38:33,373 --> 00:38:37,384
Let you leave without a trace

578
00:38:37,425 --> 00:38:41,471
When I stand here taking every breath

579
00:38:41,513 --> 00:38:45,934
With you Ooh, ooh

580
00:38:45,976 --> 00:38:52,107
You're the only one who
really knew me at all

581
00:38:52,148 --> 00:38:55,819
So take a look at me now

582
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:59,364
There's just an empty space

583
00:38:59,406 --> 00:39:03,660
There's nothing left here to remind me

584
00:39:03,702 --> 00:39:06,621
Just the memory of your face

585
00:39:06,656 --> 00:39:10,792
Take a look at me now

586
00:39:14,004 --> 00:39:17,549
- Do you remember that song?
- Yeah.

587
00:39:17,591 --> 00:39:20,552
I thought you would.

588
00:39:20,594 --> 00:39:23,388
All I'm saying is that I don't
understand the idea of living...

589
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:26,016
with just one person
for the rest of my life.

590
00:39:26,051 --> 00:39:28,476
How do you make a choice like that?

591
00:39:28,518 --> 00:39:30,437
That's like choosing what
you're gonna wear in 25 years.

592
00:39:30,478 --> 00:39:33,710
It things worked that way, everyone
would still be wearing hot pants.

593
00:39:33,745 --> 00:39:36,943
- Ya dig? - I never wore hot pants,
so there goes your whole argument.

594
00:39:36,985 --> 00:39:40,238
Hey, life is supposed
to be a ride, right?

595
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:44,034
You want to be on your deathbed saying,
"I played by all the rules," or "I lived"?

596
00:39:44,075 --> 00:39:47,454
'Cause I lived. I loved.
I fought. I broke hearts.

597
00:39:47,495 --> 00:39:50,373
I screamed. I bled.

598
00:39:50,415 --> 00:39:52,959
I guess thinking like that can
explain your hostility toward marriage.

599
00:39:53,001 --> 00:39:56,880
I don't have hostility toward marriage.
I just have hostility towards my husband.

600
00:39:56,915 --> 00:39:59,633
You're married?

601
00:39:59,674 --> 00:40:01,600
Yep. Twice, actually.

602
00:40:01,635 --> 00:40:04,971
you saw him. I was
kissing him at the airport.

603
00:40:05,013 --> 00:40:09,184
My husband Carl was a hustler
from the first day I met him.

604
00:40:09,219 --> 00:40:12,270
Who am I to talk? I was a dog walker.

605
00:40:12,312 --> 00:40:16,149
He convinced me I should invest
in a bagel store down in Savannah,

606
00:40:16,191 --> 00:40:18,443
because he thought they
couldn't make good bagels.

607
00:40:18,485 --> 00:40:20,368
That's why they lost the Civil War.

608
00:40:20,403 --> 00:40:22,781
Of course, we had to
invest all my money,

609
00:40:22,822 --> 00:40:26,451
because Carl's was tied up
in some phony tax shelter.

610
00:40:26,486 --> 00:40:30,080
- Is that your $25,000 you were talking about?
- Yep.

611
00:40:30,121 --> 00:40:34,584
I am going to sell the place, get
the last in a string of divorces.

612
00:40:34,626 --> 00:40:38,255
of course, he doesn't know
about it, or the divorce.

613
00:40:38,296 --> 00:40:41,132
Wow. What a story.

614
00:40:41,174 --> 00:40:44,719
So do you think it's a
terrible thing I'm doing?

615
00:40:44,761 --> 00:40:49,432
You know, deceiving my husband?

616
00:40:49,474 --> 00:40:54,104
No, I
- It's none of my business.

617
00:40:54,145 --> 00:40:57,440
Well, I do.

618
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:04,197
Beg you listen me, don't
be kissin' me till I'm done

619
00:41:04,239 --> 00:41:08,243
I'm some champion of
reason like seasoning

620
00:41:08,285 --> 00:41:11,288
Pepper your thoughts with
spice and entice you to a space

621
00:41:11,329 --> 00:41:14,082
Where bass players or layers are leaps

622
00:41:14,124 --> 00:41:16,835
Think what I think with
my prayers, it's nice

623
00:41:16,876 --> 00:41:19,546
My world is everything
I've become contained

624
00:41:19,588 --> 00:41:22,132
In the hum between voice and drum

625
00:41:22,173 --> 00:41:24,968
I'm comin' from the same
place I'm still runnin' from

626
00:41:25,010 --> 00:41:30,181
Even sittin' in the garden
I can still get stung

627
00:41:41,443 --> 00:41:45,989
- Hi.
- Hello.

628
00:41:46,031 --> 00:41:50,410
I'm gonna go outside and take a walk.

629
00:41:50,452 --> 00:41:53,455
Will you watch my stuff for me?

630
00:41:53,490 --> 00:41:56,875
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay.

631
00:42:20,857 --> 00:42:23,443
My Jesus

632
00:43:11,241 --> 00:43:15,036
Mr. Spiro, hi. It's Sarah Lewis.

633
00:43:15,078 --> 00:43:20,917
Yeah, listen, I'm on my way down to
sell the bagel shop. I should be there-

634
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:23,128
What?

635
00:43:27,382 --> 00:43:30,141
No.

636
00:43:30,176 --> 00:43:33,179
Mr. Spiro, I think
that's a misunderstanding,

637
00:43:33,221 --> 00:43:36,558
'cause the man who called couldn't
possibly have been my husband.

638
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:39,811
No.

639
00:43:41,771 --> 00:43:47,193
No, Mr. Spiro, actually, my husband
- He's coming with me to sell the property.

640
00:43:47,235 --> 00:43:49,744
- Hi.
- No, no, no, no. I have these. How ya doin'?

641
00:43:49,779 --> 00:43:52,532
- It's okay. I can pay for them.
- It's the least I can do.

642
00:43:52,567 --> 00:43:54,659
- Two for the 9:30 to Savannah, please.
- Thank you.

643
00:43:54,701 --> 00:43:56,786
Residents of Savannah,
Georgia, are at risk...

644
00:43:56,870 --> 00:44:00,749
for the hurricane to make
landfall by tomorrow afternoon.

645
00:44:00,790 --> 00:44:03,126
Where's my wallet?

646
00:44:10,342 --> 00:44:13,136
Fun in the sun.

647
00:44:13,178 --> 00:44:16,598
You've already won.
We're taking you to Miami.

648
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:19,684
Hey, Ben, you know what this is?

649
00:44:19,726 --> 00:44:23,320
This is one of those real estate
things where they give you prizes.

650
00:44:23,355 --> 00:44:27,150
You look at one of their condos. I used
to do phone solicitation for these guys.

651
00:44:27,185 --> 00:44:29,486
I was wonderin' why you hadn't
mentioned phone solicitation.

652
00:44:29,527 --> 00:44:33,281
They'll take you anywhere it they think
there's a chance of you buyin' a condo.

653
00:44:33,323 --> 00:44:36,618
I'm sure you've done this
before, but it's not my speed.

654
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:38,960
Benjie, make you a deal, okay?

655
00:44:38,995 --> 00:44:42,624
I will get you on the bus. I'll get
you down to Savannah for your wedding,

656
00:44:42,666 --> 00:44:47,879
if once we're down there just for a couple
of minutes, you pretend you're my husband.

657
00:44:47,921 --> 00:44:51,841
What do I have to do? Treat you badly
and get you to make bad investments?

658
00:44:51,883 --> 00:44:56,221
No. We have no other option. What
options do we have? Zero. None.

659
00:44:56,263 --> 00:44:59,683
Yet still somehow, they seem
more appealing than this one.

660
00:44:59,718 --> 00:45:02,143
I'm going another way. Wait, Sarah.

661
00:45:02,185 --> 00:45:06,731
- I don't wanna be your husband.
- Ben. Ben.

662
00:45:06,773 --> 00:45:10,610
- Do you think I like these?
- I don't know. Everybody's different.

663
00:45:10,652 --> 00:45:13,947
No, Ben, this is not for me.
This is for a little person.

664
00:45:13,989 --> 00:45:18,743
- I know, your nephew.
- No, not my nephew, my son.

665
00:45:18,785 --> 00:45:21,830
- You have a son?
- Yes, I have a son.

666
00:45:21,871 --> 00:45:27,210
I have a ten-year-old boy who lives
in Savannah with my first ex-husband.

667
00:45:27,245 --> 00:45:29,963
And, um, I haven't seen
him in, like, two years.

668
00:45:30,005 --> 00:45:34,301
I wanted to take the money from the
store, and I wanted to give it to him...

669
00:45:34,336 --> 00:45:37,352
for college or school
or whatever he wanted.

670
00:45:37,387 --> 00:45:43,059
It didn't matter to me, but I
can't go in there empty-handed.

671
00:45:43,094 --> 00:45:46,271
So, please?

672
00:45:48,565 --> 00:45:50,400
Hey, everybody. I want your
attention for one second.

673
00:45:50,442 --> 00:45:52,235
Hey, everybody. I want your
attention for one second.

674
00:45:52,270 --> 00:45:54,404
I'm like to introduce
two new sun seekers.

675
00:45:54,446 --> 00:45:57,073
Okay, Ben and Sarah.

676
00:45:57,115 --> 00:45:59,576
- Holmes and Lewis.
- Just married.

677
00:45:59,618 --> 00:46:02,287
Yes, I'm keeping my name.
What am I? His slave?

678
00:46:02,329 --> 00:46:05,714
They missed their bus, so I
thought we'd give them a ride.

679
00:46:05,749 --> 00:46:09,294
Actually, as it turns out, they
are looking for a place to live.

680
00:46:09,336 --> 00:46:13,924
We were gonna stay with his parents, but I can
take that for a week before I poke out my eye.

681
00:46:13,959 --> 00:46:16,558
No offense, honey, but
really, they're not human.

682
00:46:16,593 --> 00:46:20,347
And guess what, everybody. You're
gonna love this. Ben is a doctor.

683
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:25,852
We came to the right bus.

684
00:46:25,894 --> 00:46:29,105
Tell 'em what your specialty is.

685
00:46:29,147 --> 00:46:32,359
What's your specialty, pooky?

686
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,492
Tsk.

687
00:46:34,527 --> 00:46:37,447
He's a surgeon. Yeah.

688
00:46:37,489 --> 00:46:39,783
- Going to be.
- Going.

689
00:46:39,824 --> 00:46:42,035
He's shy. Brain surgeon.

690
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:45,163
That's why we're
relocating down to Miami.

691
00:46:45,205 --> 00:46:48,833
Let's face facts. It's like one
big emergency room down there.

692
00:46:48,875 --> 00:46:51,211
No offense. No offense.

693
00:46:57,592 --> 00:47:01,471
Every day I get in the queue

694
00:47:01,506 --> 00:47:03,390
Too much, magic bus

695
00:47:03,431 --> 00:47:07,442
Get on the bus It takes me to you

696
00:47:07,477 --> 00:47:11,314
I'm so nervous I just sit down and smile

697
00:47:11,356 --> 00:47:16,653
Okay, one hour fiesta. A little taste
of Mexico, and you can drink the water.

698
00:47:16,695 --> 00:47:20,789
Ben Holmes. Sorry
about the collect call.

699
00:47:20,824 --> 00:47:26,496
I'll reimburse you when I get
- Okay. Is Bridget around?

700
00:47:26,531 --> 00:47:30,333
Uh-huh. She's out to
lunch. Okay. Who's Steve?

701
00:47:32,502 --> 00:47:34,796
- Come on.
- Yes.

702
00:47:34,831 --> 00:47:37,055
Hyah, hyah, hyah.

703
00:47:37,090 --> 00:47:40,760
Hyah, hyah, hyah, hyah.

704
00:47:42,429 --> 00:47:44,472
Hi.

705
00:47:44,514 --> 00:47:46,808
You wanna go on the
spinning sombrero ride?

706
00:47:46,850 --> 00:47:49,060
- No, not really.
- Oh, come on.

707
00:47:49,102 --> 00:47:51,271
Bunch of 70-year-olds
are going. Come on.

708
00:47:51,313 --> 00:47:53,440
Sarah, there's two
kinds of people in life.

709
00:47:53,481 --> 00:47:56,943
The kind that look at the
spinning sombrero ride and think...

710
00:47:56,978 --> 00:47:58,862
that there's maybe some
amusement to be had there...

711
00:47:58,904 --> 00:48:01,698
and the kind that look at it and
think, "Where will I throw up after?"

712
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:04,868
You really should get some thrills
in your life before you die.

713
00:48:04,903 --> 00:48:07,245
- Nausea is not a thrill.
- Shh!

714
00:48:08,914 --> 00:48:11,374
I've noticed you around.

715
00:48:11,416 --> 00:48:13,627
Everybody, say, "Come on, Ben. "

716
00:48:13,662 --> 00:48:16,588
Come on, Ben!

717
00:48:16,630 --> 00:48:17,964
All right.

718
00:48:17,999 --> 00:48:19,466
Whoo!

719
00:48:27,265 --> 00:48:30,810
Don't throw up on me, Tony.

720
00:48:30,852 --> 00:48:32,687
Let it out, baby!

721
00:48:52,290 --> 00:48:54,376
Murray!

722
00:48:56,586 --> 00:48:58,838
Hey! Stop the ride!

723
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:01,174
Stop the ride!

724
00:49:04,261 --> 00:49:07,472
Give him some room.

725
00:49:07,514 --> 00:49:10,350
Where's Dr. Holmes? Anybody
see Dr. Holmes? Dr. Holmes!

726
00:49:10,385 --> 00:49:16,273
Dr. Holmes, I think we, uh
- I think we need you.

727
00:49:18,149 --> 00:49:22,988
Step back. Let the
doctor do some work, huh?

728
00:49:23,029 --> 00:49:27,867
- Uh, all right. Call 911.
- Somebody call 911!

729
00:49:27,902 --> 00:49:29,786
We're gonna get your head back here.

730
00:49:29,828 --> 00:49:33,373
Okay. Listen for breath,
check for a pulse.

731
00:49:33,415 --> 00:49:36,341
Hey, you know what. Step back, guys.

732
00:49:36,376 --> 00:49:42,048
Let him breathe a little
bit, huh? Step back.

733
00:49:45,552 --> 00:49:48,263
Excuse me, guys. Excuse me.

734
00:49:48,298 --> 00:49:50,939
Dr. Keller, this is Dr. Holmes.

735
00:49:50,974 --> 00:49:54,311
He suffered an acute
myocardial infarction...

736
00:49:54,352 --> 00:49:57,647
that was complicated by
ventricular fibrillation.

737
00:49:57,689 --> 00:50:00,532
Okay.

738
00:50:00,567 --> 00:50:04,446
But he's going to be fine. You
saved his life. Good work, Doctor.

739
00:50:04,487 --> 00:50:06,615
Good work.

740
00:50:06,656 --> 00:50:10,410
Hey, everyone, I think out
of respect for Florence,

741
00:50:10,445 --> 00:50:12,913
we're gonna stay here
in town tonight, okay?

742
00:50:12,948 --> 00:50:16,381
I made arrangements at a local motel.

743
00:50:16,416 --> 00:50:20,712
We really have to get on the road,
so we're gonna part ways here.

744
00:50:20,754 --> 00:50:25,508
- I absolutely insist. See ya
outside. - No, no, no, we're-

745
00:50:33,767 --> 00:50:37,145
Wow. What a passion pit.

746
00:50:37,187 --> 00:50:40,941
It's the honeymoon suite. Imagine
what the wedding must have been like.

747
00:50:40,982 --> 00:50:42,817
Mm-mmm.

748
00:50:55,330 --> 00:50:58,124
I think I'm gonna take a bath.

749
00:51:14,808 --> 00:51:16,810
- Hi.
- Door won't close.

750
00:51:16,851 --> 00:51:19,813
Need some help?

751
00:51:23,066 --> 00:51:26,486
Thank you.

752
00:52:08,111 --> 00:52:11,323
Oh, yeah. Oh.

753
00:52:11,364 --> 00:52:16,036
If I call three times a day

754
00:52:16,077 --> 00:52:20,707
Come and drive my blues away

755
00:52:21,958 --> 00:52:26,713
Be ready to play

756
00:52:26,755 --> 00:52:31,343
Do your, do your

757
00:52:31,384 --> 00:52:35,555
If you want to have some luck

758
00:52:35,590 --> 00:52:39,726
Give your baby your last buck

759
00:52:39,761 --> 00:52:42,896
And it you can't be

760
00:52:42,938 --> 00:52:45,023
With the one you love, honey

761
00:52:45,065 --> 00:52:47,609
Love the one you're with

762
00:52:47,651 --> 00:52:49,986
Love the one you're with

763
00:52:50,028 --> 00:52:54,824
- I heard you said you didn't love me

764
00:52:57,744 --> 00:53:00,712
If I need attention

765
00:53:00,747 --> 00:53:06,461
Call, I'll call you on the phone

766
00:53:06,503 --> 00:53:10,305
I'm gonna head down to the gift shop.

767
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:15,262
- It's Ben.
- Okay. Thanks for clearing that up.

768
00:53:15,303 --> 00:53:18,647
If my radiator gets too hot

769
00:53:18,682 --> 00:53:22,519
Yeah, Dad, uh, wire the money to, uh,

770
00:53:22,561 --> 00:53:25,737
Cash-O-Gram office in
Orin, South Carolina.

771
00:53:25,772 --> 00:53:29,074
Yeah, Ben, Orin, South
Carolina, but what are you do-

772
00:53:29,109 --> 00:53:31,945
- What is he doing in South Carolina?
- I'm handling this.

773
00:53:31,987 --> 00:53:33,905
What are you doing in South Carolina?

774
00:53:33,947 --> 00:53:36,741
What's going on? Are you coming
through the Bermuda Triangle?

775
00:53:36,783 --> 00:53:39,369
Could I talk to you guys a second?

776
00:53:39,404 --> 00:53:41,288
- Certainly.
- Yeah, sure.

777
00:53:41,329 --> 00:53:44,874
I was wondering- I
mean, I- Are you happy?

778
00:53:44,916 --> 00:53:48,260
- You're asking if we're happy?
- Yeah.

779
00:53:48,295 --> 00:53:50,672
- We're very proud of you.
- That's not what he asked.

780
00:53:50,714 --> 00:53:53,008
- He asked if we're happy.
- I heard what he said.

781
00:53:53,049 --> 00:53:55,635
- Why shouldn't we be
happy? - I mean, uh-

782
00:53:55,677 --> 00:53:58,179
With your lives together,
with your marriage.

783
00:53:58,221 --> 00:54:01,224
- What kind of questions are these?
- What's this about?

784
00:54:02,601 --> 00:54:05,729
Well, on the way down
here, I met this woman.

785
00:54:05,770 --> 00:54:08,857
- Oh, Ben, you idiot!
- Would you let him talk?

786
00:54:08,899 --> 00:54:10,400
What woman, you idiot?

787
00:54:10,525 --> 00:54:12,450
She's just
- It's not like that.

788
00:54:12,485 --> 00:54:15,947
It's just that she's completely
different than anyone I've ever met.

789
00:54:15,989 --> 00:54:18,033
Please! They always are!

790
00:54:18,074 --> 00:54:20,076
This is not good timing.

791
00:54:20,118 --> 00:54:23,413
- You're supposed to be getting married.
- I know, Mom.

792
00:54:23,455 --> 00:54:29,002
I want to know how, when you got married, how
you knew you were the right ones for one another.

793
00:54:29,037 --> 00:54:30,712
I understand. Listen to me.

794
00:54:30,754 --> 00:54:35,967
Ben, when I met your father, I had
an opportunity to marry Sam Wellman.

795
00:54:36,009 --> 00:54:38,970
- Sam Wellman?
- Shh! Will you please?

796
00:54:39,012 --> 00:54:42,224
- Who is now a very prominent
businessman- - He sells pools.

797
00:54:42,265 --> 00:54:45,435
They're not even built-in.
They're the kind you blow up.

798
00:54:45,477 --> 00:54:47,520
- Some are built-in.
- Even they leak.

799
00:54:47,646 --> 00:54:49,606
It's okay. You know what? It's tine.

800
00:54:49,648 --> 00:54:51,566
I was just curious, but it's-

801
00:54:51,608 --> 00:54:53,652
Dad, I appreciate it if
you could wire the money.

802
00:54:53,693 --> 00:54:57,530
- I'll be down there as soon as I can, okay?
- Okay, kid. Take care, huh?

803
00:54:57,572 --> 00:55:00,700
Yeah. Bye-bye.

804
00:55:00,735 --> 00:55:02,869
Thanks.

805
00:55:10,168 --> 00:55:12,796
- Whoo! Okay. Okay,
now, we're honeymooning.

806
00:55:12,831 --> 00:55:15,013
All right.

807
00:55:15,048 --> 00:55:17,133
But, I mean, it seems like
what you're saying, though,

808
00:55:17,175 --> 00:55:19,719
is that marriage itself is good.

809
00:55:19,761 --> 00:55:24,224
Oh, you know, yeah
- You gotta remember your parents were young once.

810
00:55:24,266 --> 00:55:26,434
They went out dancing.

811
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:29,104
They made love in the
back seats of cars.

812
00:55:29,145 --> 00:55:32,148
Then they got married and had
kids, and the kids, they slowly...

813
00:55:32,190 --> 00:55:34,442
sucked the life right out of them,

814
00:55:34,484 --> 00:55:37,988
until all their passion, all
their visions of a life...

815
00:55:38,029 --> 00:55:41,575
of great adventure are
reduced to hoping to be able...

816
00:55:41,610 --> 00:55:43,535
to sit on a goddamned toilet in peace!

817
00:55:46,871 --> 00:55:47,914
Well, I'm gonna get
something to eat, Joe, so I-

818
00:55:47,956 --> 00:55:48,915
Well, I'm gonna get
something to eat, Joe, so I-

819
00:55:48,957 --> 00:55:52,085
- I can't believe it!
- How weird!

820
00:55:52,127 --> 00:55:55,380
- Ben! Oh my God!
- Hey!

821
00:55:55,422 --> 00:55:58,008
- What's going on? Hey, Debbie.
- Hi!

822
00:55:58,049 --> 00:55:59,968
- How are ya?
- I'm good.

823
00:56:00,010 --> 00:56:02,888
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

824
00:56:02,929 --> 00:56:05,599
Uh, it's
- You would not believe what happened to me.

825
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:07,726
Tell me about it. When they closed
La Guardia, I couldn't get a flight...

826
00:56:07,851 --> 00:56:10,645
out of Newark or J.F.K.,
but, uh, luckily, uh,

827
00:56:10,687 --> 00:56:12,480
Debbie here had a vehicle.

828
00:56:12,522 --> 00:56:15,108
Uh, well, there's a certain symmetry
there. Best man, maid of honor.

829
00:56:15,150 --> 00:56:17,110
- You know.
- Well, not really.

830
00:56:17,152 --> 00:56:19,070
- This is Joe.
- Hi. Farrell.

831
00:56:19,112 --> 00:56:21,197
Head of the Sunshine
Seekers Real Estate Company.

832
00:56:21,232 --> 00:56:23,742
Joe, uh
- Joe gave me a ride down here.

833
00:56:23,783 --> 00:56:26,161
And it was a pleasure. Quite a couple.

834
00:56:26,202 --> 00:56:29,956
- So, you guys staying here?
- No, no, it's like the only place for miles.

835
00:56:29,991 --> 00:56:31,583
You know, we thought we'd
stop, get a bite to eat, pee.

836
00:56:31,625 --> 00:56:34,920
- Yeah, so come on. We'll give you a lift.
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

837
00:56:34,961 --> 00:56:38,590
- You're not taking the good doctor away from us now.
- The good doctor?

838
00:56:38,632 --> 00:56:41,468
So, maybe you guys should just eat,

839
00:56:41,509 --> 00:56:43,470
and I’ll just come back down
and meet you in say, you know-

840
00:56:43,511 --> 00:56:45,520
- Fifteen minutes? Is that good?
- Great.

841
00:56:45,555 --> 00:56:48,225
- Let me grab the stuff out of my
room. - You got a- You got a room?

842
00:56:48,266 --> 00:56:50,894
- Yeah, the honeymoon
suite. A little ba-da-bing.

843
00:56:50,936 --> 00:56:53,271
That's right. Rehearsing
for tomorrow night.

844
00:56:53,313 --> 00:56:57,234
- What's tomorrow night?
- Hey, this kid's gettin' married.

845
00:56:57,275 --> 00:57:00,535
Yeah.

846
00:57:00,570 --> 00:57:03,323
That's
- that's funny. He's already married.

847
00:57:09,871 --> 00:57:11,796
That's true, you know,

848
00:57:11,831 --> 00:57:14,716
but, uh, in my heart I'm already there.

849
00:57:14,751 --> 00:57:17,587
But we all have lives to lead, so let's move
on with that, and I'll see you guys in a bit.

850
00:57:17,629 --> 00:57:20,590
Nice talking to ya, Joe. Okay, guys.

851
00:57:20,632 --> 00:57:23,718
You gotta have heart

852
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:26,012
Please, ma'am, I need
your signature, ma'am.

853
00:57:26,054 --> 00:57:29,015
Signature? For what?

854
00:57:29,057 --> 00:57:31,226
Look at this. It says
"'damaged. " Do you see?

855
00:57:31,268 --> 00:57:34,604
- Can you read, young man? D-
A-M-A-G-E-D, damaged. - Damaged.

856
00:57:38,525 --> 00:57:42,487
We're very proud of Ben.

857
00:57:42,529 --> 00:57:46,157
If he's late, believe you
me, he has a good reason.

858
00:57:46,199 --> 00:57:49,786
What I don't understand is
how, in this day and age...

859
00:57:49,828 --> 00:57:52,956
of A.T.M.'s and cell
phones and the Internet...

860
00:57:52,991 --> 00:57:55,590
and Voyager Two,

861
00:57:55,625 --> 00:57:59,129
could it take two
days- two days-

862
00:57:59,170 --> 00:58:02,591
to get from New York to Savannah.

863
00:58:02,632 --> 00:58:06,386
Oh, don't drink out
of the bottle, darling.

864
00:58:06,428 --> 00:58:08,847
Thank you.

865
00:58:08,889 --> 00:58:11,308
We are really very proud of him.

866
00:58:13,476 --> 00:58:16,146
This is ridiculous.

867
00:58:16,187 --> 00:58:18,440
I'll put an end to this right now.

868
00:58:18,481 --> 00:58:23,820
Pretending to be a doctor, listening to
my parents' advice on my personal life.

869
00:58:23,855 --> 00:58:27,240
Sarah? Sarah?

870
00:58:36,207 --> 00:58:39,336
And where's my lousy maid
of honor? Where's Debbie?

871
00:58:39,377 --> 00:58:41,796
Huh? Can I not at least have that?

872
00:58:41,838 --> 00:58:46,218
Who's supposed to be pouring me drinks while
I'm being stood up by the so-called groom?

873
00:58:46,259 --> 00:58:48,053
Answer me that. Thank you.

874
00:58:48,094 --> 00:58:50,972
Honey, he'll be here.
It's all gonna work out.

875
00:58:51,014 --> 00:58:53,767
It's true, Bridge. Husband
and wife, that is something.

876
00:58:53,808 --> 00:58:56,519
It must be nice to see your
parents back together, though.

877
00:58:56,561 --> 00:58:59,105
Yeah, talk about a match made in hell.

878
00:58:59,147 --> 00:59:01,858
What do you mean, "back together?"

879
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:04,569
What do you mean you're separated?

880
00:59:04,611 --> 00:59:06,404
Oh, honey, baby, sugar lump,

881
00:59:06,446 --> 00:59:09,991
it means your father has
an apartment he stays in...

882
00:59:10,033 --> 00:59:12,369
- when you're not here.
- I'm never here.

883
00:59:12,410 --> 00:59:14,419
I stay there a lot.

884
00:59:14,454 --> 00:59:17,249
When were you going to tell me?

885
00:59:17,290 --> 00:59:19,376
Honey, we didn't want
to spoil your wedding.

886
00:59:19,459 --> 00:59:22,379
This is your special time.
Well, it would have been.

887
00:59:23,463 --> 00:59:28,760
Okay.

888
00:59:30,554 --> 00:59:33,640
Get me outta here.

889
00:59:44,734 --> 00:59:47,737
Whoo!

890
01:00:12,429 --> 01:00:17,267
- Look who's here. Hey, Ben.
- There's Ben.

891
01:00:22,856 --> 01:00:26,026
I want to buy this man-

892
01:00:29,946 --> 01:00:31,948
Whoo!

893
01:00:43,001 --> 01:00:45,921
Whoo!

894
01:01:01,478 --> 01:01:04,814
Whoo!

895
01:01:12,614 --> 01:01:14,366
Get out there.

896
01:01:14,407 --> 01:01:17,494
How can you resist it?

897
01:01:29,297 --> 01:01:32,634
You look like you should be writing to your
congressman to protest cuts in Medicare.

898
01:01:32,676 --> 01:01:34,594
Really? That's exactly
the look I was going for,

899
01:01:34,636 --> 01:01:36,930
compliments of Sun Seeker Phyllis.

900
01:01:36,972 --> 01:01:39,147
Listen, Sarah, I just ran into, uh-

901
01:01:39,182 --> 01:01:41,810
Shh. You can't do two
things at one time.

902
01:01:41,851 --> 01:01:44,396
- Well, the plans that
we sort of- - Okay.

903
01:01:44,437 --> 01:01:48,608
You obviously didn't win your fiancée
over on the dance floor either, did you?

904
01:01:53,905 --> 01:01:57,367
How did you and Bridget meet?

905
01:01:57,402 --> 01:02:00,537
- Uh, at a party.
- And?

906
01:02:00,579 --> 01:02:03,790
- It was a surprise party.
- Oh, what a beautiful story.

907
01:02:03,832 --> 01:02:05,792
It must have been a magical night.

908
01:02:05,834 --> 01:02:07,794
No wonder you can't write your vows.

909
01:02:15,802 --> 01:02:19,347
No offense, but I'm not sure I should
be taking romantic advice from you.

910
01:02:19,389 --> 01:02:22,225
- You think?
- Failure's a fantastic teacher.

911
01:02:22,267 --> 01:02:24,853
You could learn from my
mistakes. I could tell you...

912
01:02:24,895 --> 01:02:27,480
everything I hated about my husbands and
my boyfriends so you don't do the same.

913
01:02:27,522 --> 01:02:29,774
- Should I get a pad?
- Get a scroll.

914
01:02:29,816 --> 01:02:31,943
- A scroll?
- Aw, okay.

915
01:02:31,985 --> 01:02:36,239
Never forget her birthday. Make a
really, really big deal out of it.

916
01:02:36,281 --> 01:02:38,373
After sex, hold her for a little while.

917
01:02:38,408 --> 01:02:41,036
- You know, talk to her like a human being.
- Ah.

918
01:02:41,077 --> 01:02:45,206
Uh, oh, and do not
wear your socks to bed.

919
01:02:45,248 --> 01:02:47,042
- Why?
- No socks to bed,

920
01:02:47,083 --> 01:02:49,669
because you might not be all
that attractive to begin with.

921
01:02:49,711 --> 01:02:51,630
No. Keep going.

922
01:02:51,671 --> 01:02:55,342
Always, always side with her
in an argument with your mother.

923
01:02:55,377 --> 01:02:59,971
Um, listen to her like you mean it.

924
01:03:00,013 --> 01:03:04,100
Supportiveness is a
really, really sexy turn-on.

925
01:03:04,135 --> 01:03:05,936
- Never, ever hit.
- No.

926
01:03:05,977 --> 01:03:09,064
No. And, um,

927
01:03:09,105 --> 01:03:11,740
- no matter what annoying
habits she has, - Mm-hmm.

928
01:03:11,775 --> 01:03:16,071
just realize that she's dealing with a
huge mountain of imperfections every day.

929
01:03:16,112 --> 01:03:19,532
So you might just want to let it go.

930
01:03:19,567 --> 01:03:21,701
- That's it.
- That's it?

931
01:03:21,743 --> 01:03:25,121
Yep.

932
01:03:58,196 --> 01:04:00,490
- Hey, can I sit there?
- Hey.

933
01:04:05,495 --> 01:04:07,831
- Hey- Aaah!
Ohhh! - Oh!

934
01:04:07,872 --> 01:04:10,131
Uh, let's get some air.

935
01:04:10,166 --> 01:04:13,378
- Why? - I'm
just- I'm hot.

936
01:04:13,420 --> 01:04:16,548
Grilled prawns or something?

937
01:04:18,508 --> 01:04:20,510
One second.

938
01:04:27,100 --> 01:04:29,227
- What's the matter with you?
- Hmm?

939
01:04:29,269 --> 01:04:31,438
- What's the matter with you? -
Nothing's the matter with me. Do, uh-

940
01:04:31,479 --> 01:04:34,357
- Do you know how to swim?
- Of course I know how to swim.

941
01:04:55,629 --> 01:04:58,131
Aaah!

942
01:05:03,970 --> 01:05:06,848
I'm tellin' you, I
saw him come out here.

943
01:05:06,890 --> 01:05:09,601
That
- That's him down there. That's him.

944
01:05:09,643 --> 01:05:13,063
- I don't see anything.
- There's a body at the bottom of the pool.

945
01:05:13,104 --> 01:05:15,440
No, I think that's just a big drain.

946
01:05:15,482 --> 01:05:18,985
I don't know what you're talking about.

947
01:05:19,020 --> 01:05:21,571
Oh, and P.S.
- you're a moron.

948
01:05:21,613 --> 01:05:24,074
Hello? Excuse me? Hi. Hi.

949
01:05:24,115 --> 01:05:26,618
- Do you know Ben Holmes?
- I'm sorry. Know who?

950
01:05:26,660 --> 01:05:29,120
Ben Holmes. Is that Ben
at the bottom of the pool?

951
01:05:29,162 --> 01:05:31,998
I don't know, but I
could go ask for you.

952
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:34,799
It's not Ben, okay?
He's afraid of the water.

953
01:05:34,834 --> 01:05:38,505
He goes to the beach in a suit
and tie. Come on, let's go.

954
01:05:38,547 --> 01:05:40,882
I found it! I got it, I got it.

955
01:05:40,924 --> 01:05:43,718
- What?
- Godamn contact lenses.

956
01:05:43,753 --> 01:05:46,478
You oughta just stick with glasses.

957
01:05:46,513 --> 01:05:48,598
Oh, hey, guys? What's
going on? What's happening?

958
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:50,649
- Hi.
- Hey, Alan.

959
01:05:50,684 --> 01:05:52,894
This is Sarah. Sarah, Alan.

960
01:05:53,019 --> 01:05:55,689
- This is my best man at my wedding.
- Hey. How are you?

961
01:05:55,730 --> 01:05:57,607
Debbie. This is the maid of honor.

962
01:05:57,691 --> 01:06:00,068
- Hi, Debbie.
- Hi.

963
01:06:00,110 --> 01:06:02,153
So, how'd you two hook up?

964
01:06:02,195 --> 01:06:04,364
Uh, I wouldn't say that
we're hooked up, really.

965
01:06:04,406 --> 01:06:09,417
I sort of barely know this person, but-

966
01:06:09,452 --> 01:06:12,289
You were on the bus, right? Yeah,
we rode down on the bus together.

967
01:06:12,330 --> 01:06:15,834
There's a whole group of
folks. Rode down together.

968
01:06:15,876 --> 01:06:18,753
Okay, and the whole pool thing?

969
01:06:18,795 --> 01:06:21,513
She fell in the pool, and uh,

970
01:06:21,548 --> 01:06:24,134
didn't look like she
was a strong swimmer.

971
01:06:24,175 --> 01:06:26,636
She was kind of flailing around, so I-

972
01:06:26,678 --> 01:06:29,890
There's no lifeguard on duty
if you see the sign there,

973
01:06:29,931 --> 01:06:33,191
So I jumped in, and you
know, hauled her out.

974
01:06:33,226 --> 01:06:36,354
Then, in the course of that,
the contact lens fell out.

975
01:06:36,396 --> 01:06:39,733
Here you go, miss. You oughta be
careful with these, because they're-

976
01:06:39,768 --> 01:06:41,568
Here you go. It's your contact lens.

977
01:06:41,610 --> 01:06:43,945
That's a great story.

978
01:06:43,987 --> 01:06:48,366
Bridget's really lucky to be
marrying such a great swimmer.

979
01:06:48,408 --> 01:06:52,377
Whoa! What happened here?

980
01:06:52,412 --> 01:06:54,915
Well, perhaps after you dry off,
you'll come back in for another dance?

981
01:06:54,956 --> 01:06:58,084
- You got it, Herman.
- Dr. Holmes, you don't mind...

982
01:06:58,119 --> 01:07:00,754
if I dance with your wife, do you?

983
01:07:02,756 --> 01:07:05,634
Yeah. You don't mind, do you sweetie?

984
01:07:05,675 --> 01:07:09,429
- All right, all right. Well, I'll see you in there.
- Okay.

985
01:07:29,032 --> 01:07:31,493
I'm pretty disappointed in you, Ben.

986
01:07:31,534 --> 01:07:33,954
You know, everybody's always
telling Bridget she's so lucky...

987
01:07:33,989 --> 01:07:35,872
because you're such a nice guy.

988
01:07:35,914 --> 01:07:39,376
Debbie, I am a nice guy, all
right? This is not what you think.

989
01:07:39,411 --> 01:07:41,753
Okay. Whatever, Dr. Holmes.

990
01:07:41,795 --> 01:07:44,548
Okay?

991
01:07:46,216 --> 01:07:50,637
- Alan?
- Ben, you don't need to explain, okay?

992
01:07:50,672 --> 01:07:52,764
Remember, I'm the guy who begged you...

993
01:07:52,806 --> 01:07:55,100
to sleep with more women
before you got married.

994
01:07:55,141 --> 01:07:57,185
I am not sleeping with her, man!

995
01:07:57,227 --> 01:07:59,271
Okay? There's nothing going on!

996
01:08:00,939 --> 01:08:03,942
Why
- Why won't you listen to me?

997
01:08:03,984 --> 01:08:07,487
- Maybe because I'm getting married tomorrow?
- All right, look, Ben.

998
01:08:07,529 --> 01:08:09,447
It you're not gonna take
advantage of a night...

999
01:08:09,489 --> 01:08:15,245
that's gonna get you through many
sad, pathetic, lonely years, then-

1000
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:17,163
My God.

1001
01:08:17,205 --> 01:08:19,165
I'll see you in the
lobby in five minutes.

1002
01:08:27,841 --> 01:08:29,885
I hate to remind you, but
we had a deal, remember?

1003
01:08:29,926 --> 01:08:33,346
You were supposed to be my husband if
I got you a ride. Do you remember that?

1004
01:08:33,388 --> 01:08:35,348
Yes, I remember that arrangement.

1005
01:08:35,432 --> 01:08:37,809
I did not, however, presuppose
the tact that Debbie...

1006
01:08:37,851 --> 01:08:40,979
is now on her way down to tell
my fiancée that I am holed up...

1007
01:08:41,021 --> 01:08:44,107
in a hotel room in South
Carolina somewhere with a woman...

1008
01:08:44,149 --> 01:08:46,241
claiming to be the wife
of the good Dr. Ben Holmes!

1009
01:08:46,276 --> 01:08:49,404
What was I supposed to do? The
Sunshine people think we're married.

1010
01:08:49,446 --> 01:08:54,326
They would have stoned us. As it is, I already
feel bad enough about not buying a condo.

1011
01:08:54,367 --> 01:08:56,161
Why don't you just
tell Bridget the truth?

1012
01:08:56,202 --> 01:08:58,747
What kind of marriage do you
have if she doesn't believe you?

1013
01:08:58,788 --> 01:09:01,291
- Just explain why you're with
me- - Sarah, I'm not with you!

1014
01:09:01,333 --> 01:09:03,668
We're not together! This
is not a relationship!

1015
01:09:03,710 --> 01:09:06,796
I just happen to be traveling
alongside a natural disaster!

1016
01:09:06,838 --> 01:09:09,424
- You know what? I
really feel sorry for you.

1017
01:09:09,466 --> 01:09:12,886
'Cause at least when I was getting
married, I could admit I was scared.

1018
01:09:12,928 --> 01:09:16,306
- Well, save me your pity, because I am not scared.
- You know what?

1019
01:09:16,348 --> 01:09:19,100
You have such a problem with
honesty, Ben, you know that?

1020
01:09:19,142 --> 01:09:21,811
- Oh.
- You can't tell your fiancée what's going on.

1021
01:09:21,853 --> 01:09:25,607
You can't explain something absolutely
simple and innocent to your best man,

1022
01:09:25,649 --> 01:09:27,651
and you are with me, Ben!

1023
01:09:27,692 --> 01:09:29,778
You could have left a
hundred times, but you didn't!

1024
01:09:29,819 --> 01:09:32,906
- I tried to!
- Then why are you still here?

1025
01:09:32,948 --> 01:09:35,457
I'm leaving! All right, tine!

1026
01:09:35,492 --> 01:09:38,376
You wanna talk about honesty?
Let's talk about honesty.

1027
01:09:38,411 --> 01:09:41,456
- Bring it on.
- You complain about your life, nonstop, all the time.

1028
01:09:41,498 --> 01:09:43,333
It's all your fault.

1029
01:09:43,416 --> 01:09:47,420
You are a beautiful, incredible woman.
You could have any guy you wanted,

1030
01:09:47,455 --> 01:09:49,464
but you keep picking these losers.

1031
01:09:49,506 --> 01:09:52,259
And the only thing I can think of
is that you choose these guys...

1032
01:09:52,300 --> 01:09:55,011
who are intellectually inferior to
you so that you can control them,

1033
01:09:55,053 --> 01:09:59,140
but still feel conveniently
wounded when the relationship ends.

1034
01:09:59,182 --> 01:10:02,852
You're the one that's afraid of commitment.
You back out of every job you ever have!

1035
01:10:02,887 --> 01:10:05,487
You run away from anyone and anything,

1036
01:10:05,522 --> 01:10:08,441
and you think it's so
unconventional and liberating,

1037
01:10:08,483 --> 01:10:11,361
when in tact, it's just
cowardice and juvenile...

1038
01:10:11,403 --> 01:10:13,411
and unable to face the real world!

1039
01:10:13,446 --> 01:10:16,241
Ha! Okay, you want honesty,
I'll give you honesty.

1040
01:10:16,283 --> 01:10:18,952
Do you know why you can't
write your marriage vows?

1041
01:10:18,994 --> 01:10:22,122
Because you are absolutely terrified
that you have nothing to say.

1042
01:10:22,163 --> 01:10:25,000
And why would you, Ben? Because
you run around so scared...

1043
01:10:25,041 --> 01:10:29,379
that life is gonna throw you this
curveball that'll completely shatter...

1044
01:10:29,421 --> 01:10:33,383
this crystal clear, perfect existence that
you've created for yourself in your Day Timer,

1045
01:10:33,425 --> 01:10:37,304
that you blurb your way out of feeling
anything emotional, anything real.

1046
01:10:37,345 --> 01:10:41,224
You have no emotions, and that's
what makes you a shitty writer, Ben.

1047
01:10:41,259 --> 01:10:44,728
You know what? At least I
don't sit around obsessing...

1048
01:10:44,769 --> 01:10:46,646
that no one's going
to come to my funeral,

1049
01:10:46,730 --> 01:10:48,899
because I have relationships
that last longer than a week.

1050
01:10:48,940 --> 01:10:51,109
- My funeral is gonna be packed!
- You know what, Ben?

1051
01:10:51,151 --> 01:10:53,987
That is just great. And
I know your eulogy...

1052
01:10:54,029 --> 01:10:57,407
is gonna look so nice on
the back of a book cover.

1053
01:10:57,449 --> 01:11:00,827
I just think you are an
immature, selfish person.

1054
01:11:00,862 --> 01:11:03,044
Well, I'm obviously wrong.

1055
01:11:03,079 --> 01:11:07,500
Have a fabulous time in Westchester.
I do hope you enjoy the minivan.

1056
01:11:07,535 --> 01:11:11,838
God! How great it must be to be
so cool and above everyone, huh?

1057
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:14,049
It must be great! Let
me ask you somethin'.

1058
01:11:14,090 --> 01:11:16,927
How cool is it to abandon your kid?

1059
01:11:16,968 --> 01:11:21,014
I was 17 years old, okay? Fuck you.
You don't know anything about it.

1060
01:11:21,056 --> 01:11:23,016
- All right, well, try 27, Sarah,
- Nothing.

1061
01:11:23,099 --> 01:11:25,393
because seventeen's not working anymore.

1062
01:11:25,435 --> 01:11:29,689
Okay, Ben, take your marriage Clift
Notes and have a nice wedding, okay?

1063
01:11:29,731 --> 01:11:32,108
- Have a nice divorce.
- Okay.

1064
01:11:33,109 --> 01:11:36,529
Four, three, two, one.

1065
01:11:36,571 --> 01:11:38,823
- Okay, I'm leaving.
- Hey, Deb, he's comin'.

1066
01:11:38,865 --> 01:11:42,410
Five minutes. There he is. I think he's
- Come on!

1067
01:11:42,452 --> 01:11:45,587
No, no, no, don't-

1068
01:11:45,622 --> 01:11:48,792
- Well, that was smooth.
- You're getting married tomorrow, Ben.

1069
01:11:48,827 --> 01:11:52,170
What's your point?

1070
01:11:52,212 --> 01:11:55,215
Well, you see, if I'm
gonna turn my life around,

1071
01:11:55,257 --> 01:11:57,474
I can't very well
break up your marriage.

1072
01:11:57,509 --> 01:12:00,470
I'll have bad luck for the rest of
my life, karmically speaking, and I-

1073
01:12:01,471 --> 01:12:03,431
I am getting married tomorrow,

1074
01:12:03,473 --> 01:12:06,810
I have nonrefundable tickets to Hawaii,

1075
01:12:06,851 --> 01:12:10,146
and I cannot make
myself leave this room.

1076
01:12:11,189 --> 01:12:13,984
Well, I like you too, Ben.

1077
01:12:15,485 --> 01:12:17,404
I-

1078
01:12:17,445 --> 01:12:20,156
I can't go through with a
marriage like that. I can't.

1079
01:12:20,198 --> 01:12:23,702
Ben, relax. We didn't
even get to second base.

1080
01:12:23,743 --> 01:12:26,329
Have you seen Dr. Holmes and his wife?

1081
01:12:26,364 --> 01:12:28,373
We're doing the raffle.

1082
01:12:28,415 --> 01:12:31,209
He's not Dr. Holmes,
and she's not his wife.

1083
01:12:31,251 --> 01:12:33,837
Okey dokey? Okey dokey?

1084
01:12:41,094 --> 01:12:43,179
I'm gonna tell her.

1085
01:12:44,890 --> 01:12:47,350
I think at the very
least she deserves that.

1086
01:12:47,392 --> 01:12:49,853
If I can feel this
way about someone else-

1087
01:12:49,895 --> 01:12:52,147
Hey! Come on!

1088
01:12:52,188 --> 01:12:55,901
- Why does this have to get dangerous?
- Get in, you freak!

1089
01:12:55,942 --> 01:12:58,159
God!

1090
01:12:58,194 --> 01:13:00,864
Is that your ride?

1091
01:13:00,906 --> 01:13:03,533
Yeah. Yeah, it was.

1092
01:13:05,410 --> 01:13:08,587
Now what are you gonna do?

1093
01:13:08,622 --> 01:13:11,541
I don't know. Let's go get
the money my father wired.

1094
01:13:11,583 --> 01:13:14,461
That should get us a cab at least.

1095
01:13:23,345 --> 01:13:25,931
This is actually the
perfect car for this trip.

1096
01:13:25,972 --> 01:13:30,227
It's already been wrecked, totaled
and destroyed. What else can go wrong?

1097
01:13:49,412 --> 01:13:52,082
Well, you asked.

1098
01:13:52,123 --> 01:13:56,795
Really. That's interesting.

1099
01:13:56,836 --> 01:13:59,756
That's not really that funny, actually.

1100
01:14:03,176 --> 01:14:06,513
I think we should just sit here
and wait for the locusts to come!

1101
01:14:09,641 --> 01:14:12,519
Oh, my God.

1102
01:14:12,561 --> 01:14:15,320
- Oh.
- Oh.

1103
01:14:15,355 --> 01:14:18,692
- Yeah. All righty.
- Yeah.

1104
01:14:18,733 --> 01:14:22,571
She's on tire, Ben.

1105
01:14:44,134 --> 01:14:47,304
Well. I guess we should, uh-

1106
01:14:49,806 --> 01:14:53,643
Yeah. We should-

1107
01:15:32,515 --> 01:15:34,935
I am slipping!

1108
01:15:37,771 --> 01:15:40,405
This is so wrong.

1109
01:15:40,440 --> 01:15:43,693
But it feels so right to me.

1110
01:15:51,952 --> 01:15:54,829
Oh, good evening.

1111
01:15:54,871 --> 01:15:56,790
Good evening. Good evening.

1112
01:15:56,831 --> 01:15:59,417
- Hi, Joe.
- It is a good evening, isn't it?

1113
01:15:59,452 --> 01:16:02,963
Dr. Holmes, or whoever it is you are.

1114
01:16:03,004 --> 01:16:08,093
We made a call. There's no Dr.
Ben Holmes in New York City.

1115
01:16:08,134 --> 01:16:10,345
Unless you're a
veterinary brain surgeon.

1116
01:16:10,387 --> 01:16:14,099
Well, all God's creatures
are welcome in my office.

1117
01:16:14,140 --> 01:16:17,394
But the way you two carry on, you
oughta be ashamed of yourselves!

1118
01:16:17,429 --> 01:16:21,439
- You tell 'em.
- There is the matter of your bill.

1119
01:16:23,525 --> 01:16:26,611
Thank you very much.

1120
01:16:26,653 --> 01:16:28,697
I'm really sorry.

1121
01:16:28,738 --> 01:16:31,658
- Let's look at this bill here.
- Seems a little excessive.

1122
01:16:31,700 --> 01:16:34,578
No, if you add the two and the
two, that's tour, and then, uh-

1123
01:16:37,163 --> 01:16:40,208
Run! Jesus! Jesus!

1124
01:16:41,668 --> 01:16:43,837
How long do you think
before they call the police?

1125
01:16:43,879 --> 01:16:48,390
- Oh, about five minutes ago.
- All right.

1126
01:16:48,425 --> 01:16:52,095
Yesterday I was just trying to
get married, today I'm a fugitive.

1127
01:16:52,137 --> 01:16:54,139
Okay, I get it now.

1128
01:16:54,180 --> 01:16:56,558
This is a sign. This
whole thing is a sign.

1129
01:16:56,600 --> 01:16:59,102
I am not supposed to get
married. Loud and clear.

1130
01:16:59,137 --> 01:17:02,856
We have to be in
Savannah in the morning.

1131
01:17:02,891 --> 01:17:05,358
The fuzz are after us.

1132
01:17:06,902 --> 01:17:11,615
Hey, Ben, how much was that
car we saw back in the lot?

1133
01:17:11,650 --> 01:17:14,117
The disaster car? It was $150.

1134
01:17:14,159 --> 01:17:16,453
'Cause I'm thinking that if, uh-

1135
01:17:16,494 --> 01:17:18,955
It somebody went into
this place right here...

1136
01:17:18,997 --> 01:17:22,792
and did, you know, a little bump and grind
for the good old boys, they could, uh-

1137
01:17:22,834 --> 01:17:26,630
they could probably walk out of there
with that amount of money in their pocket.

1138
01:17:26,665 --> 01:17:28,847
Strip dancing?

1139
01:17:28,882 --> 01:17:31,635
You're saying you'd just go in and strip
dance? I'm talking about something serious.

1140
01:17:31,670 --> 01:17:34,179
Ben, let's weigh out
our alternatives here.

1141
01:17:34,221 --> 01:17:36,306
On one hand, what do we have? We
have a little harmless dancing...

1142
01:17:36,348 --> 01:17:39,601
that gets us to Savannah where
I have $25,000 waiting for me,

1143
01:17:39,643 --> 01:17:43,104
and you have what, 130 of your closest
family and friends waiting for you.

1144
01:17:43,139 --> 01:17:45,440
And on the other hand, we have
- oh, look, we have nothing.

1145
01:17:45,482 --> 01:17:49,569
Oh, there's nothing there. So, we have
dancing, going to Savannah. Oh, nothing!

1146
01:17:49,604 --> 01:17:52,906
- I see where you're going with this.
- You know I'm right.

1147
01:17:55,617 --> 01:17:57,536
The fuzz.

1148
01:17:57,577 --> 01:18:01,289
All right. Am I being
too prudish about this?

1149
01:18:01,331 --> 01:18:04,626
Is that what it is? Maybe I
am. I just gotta open my mind.

1150
01:18:04,668 --> 01:18:07,629
You go in there, you take your
clothes off, you have the power.

1151
01:18:07,671 --> 01:18:10,590
Post-feminist. It's aggressive.
You have the power and control.

1152
01:18:10,632 --> 01:18:13,385
I know what I'm doing. Watch my back.

1153
01:18:13,426 --> 01:18:16,555
Watch your back? What,
are we on Mod Squad now?

1154
01:18:20,183 --> 01:18:22,143
- Hiya. How ya doin'?
- Good.

1155
01:18:22,185 --> 01:18:25,570
I was wondering if y'all
had any entertainment.

1156
01:18:25,605 --> 01:18:29,192
- We got a pool table out back.
- What would you say to somebody dancing on it...

1157
01:18:29,227 --> 01:18:32,946
for a set price of, I don't know, $150?

1158
01:18:32,988 --> 01:18:36,533
I could guarantee you
a really good show.

1159
01:18:36,575 --> 01:18:40,537
- $150 seems like a lot of money.
- What? Look at her.

1160
01:18:40,579 --> 01:18:43,790
I am looking at her. I'm not interested.

1161
01:18:46,251 --> 01:18:48,962
How much for you to dance?

1162
01:18:49,004 --> 01:18:52,264
- Excuse me?
- Ben,

1163
01:18:52,299 --> 01:18:55,093
I think this is one of these places...

1164
01:18:55,135 --> 01:18:59,514
where everyone would much rather
see you dance than see me dance.

1165
01:19:00,849 --> 01:19:03,268
- You mean- - Get your
hands off of my man

1166
01:19:03,310 --> 01:19:07,981
Get your hands off of my man

1167
01:19:10,066 --> 01:19:12,444
It's not funny anymore,
because I don't even like...

1168
01:19:12,485 --> 01:19:14,369
to be naked at home
in my shower by myself.

1169
01:19:14,404 --> 01:19:16,823
- So, it was okay for me a minute ago?
- Well, it's on your resume.

1170
01:19:16,865 --> 01:19:18,825
If you want me to blurb you
a novel, I could do that.

1171
01:19:18,909 --> 01:19:20,911
So much for power and
control, big guy. Get up there.

1172
01:19:20,946 --> 01:19:22,996
- All right, I'm sorry.
- There you go.

1173
01:19:38,386 --> 01:19:43,565
Oh, watch me ride

1174
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:49,439
I'm a sexual animal
Eat you like a cannibal

1175
01:19:49,481 --> 01:19:51,942
Prime for the energy

1176
01:19:51,983 --> 01:19:55,243
I'm inflammable

1177
01:19:55,278 --> 01:19:59,783
Yeah, I finished my beer So come here

1178
01:19:59,824 --> 01:20:04,287
And get nice while I Lick your ear

1179
01:20:04,322 --> 01:20:06,998
Put your legs over there

1180
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:10,043
And kinda swing on a chair

1181
01:20:10,085 --> 01:20:12,879
I swear you look wicked

1182
01:20:12,921 --> 01:20:16,716
When your hand is in your hair

1183
01:20:16,758 --> 01:20:20,157
Eyes half closed Cute little nose

1184
01:20:20,192 --> 01:20:23,557
And like a pound of self raising

1185
01:20:23,598 --> 01:20:25,600
I roll and roll

1186
01:20:25,642 --> 01:20:28,937
Step out of my clothes

1187
01:20:28,979 --> 01:20:31,982
Like I'm doing the right thing

1188
01:20:32,023 --> 01:20:36,987
It was pumping and she was frightening

1189
01:20:37,028 --> 01:20:41,992
Yeah, lightning flashed
and thunder roared

1190
01:20:43,577 --> 01:20:45,745
They're really cheering for
you. You're doing a great job.

1191
01:20:45,787 --> 01:20:48,582
Nope. Everyone in here
is looking at your ass.

1192
01:20:48,623 --> 01:20:53,128
This is where I'm lost all night

1193
01:20:53,169 --> 01:20:58,174
If loving you is wrong
I don't want to be right

1194
01:20:58,216 --> 01:21:02,304
If loving you is wrong

1195
01:21:02,345 --> 01:21:05,473
I don't wanna be right

1196
01:21:05,515 --> 01:21:08,560
Don't wanna be right

1197
01:21:08,602 --> 01:21:12,147
If I come first Well, that's not worse

1198
01:21:25,911 --> 01:21:29,456
One take like an earthquake

1199
01:21:40,508 --> 01:21:45,722
I'll take a delight in making
the bedsprings sing all night

1200
01:21:45,764 --> 01:21:51,102
If loving you is wrong
I don't want to be right

1201
01:21:51,144 --> 01:21:54,898
- Whoo! Ha ha! Can do! Let's check it out.
- Come on.

1202
01:21:54,940 --> 01:21:57,776
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Look at that!

1203
01:21:57,817 --> 01:22:00,820
Convertible style.

1204
01:22:09,496 --> 01:22:12,666
I'm a sexual animal

1205
01:22:12,707 --> 01:22:15,835
Eat you like a cannibal

1206
01:22:17,212 --> 01:22:20,423
Well, I didn't have...

1207
01:22:20,465 --> 01:22:24,511
the g-string and the cowboy boots, but, uh,
I think it was a good showing nonetheless.

1208
01:22:24,553 --> 01:22:26,388
Don't be too proud of yourself.
You weren't that good, Ben.

1209
01:22:26,429 --> 01:22:29,057
Don't be jealous.

1210
01:22:29,099 --> 01:22:32,435
It's amazing, because the things you find
so exotic and interesting right now...

1211
01:22:32,477 --> 01:22:35,272
are gonna be the same things that
you're gonna hate me for in the end.

1212
01:22:35,307 --> 01:22:37,857
Why am I hating you in
this scenario? What's-

1213
01:22:37,899 --> 01:22:39,693
Okay? Trust me.

1214
01:22:39,734 --> 01:22:42,654
A lot of stuff’s happened really
fast. You're just not registering it.

1215
01:22:42,696 --> 01:22:45,782
It's registering, okay? I'm
a gay dancer and I'm proud.

1216
01:22:45,824 --> 01:22:47,826
I'm a gay, gay strip
dancer and I love it.

1217
01:22:47,868 --> 01:22:49,870
Registered. Cha-ching! Change!

1218
01:22:49,953 --> 01:22:53,248
The password is "denial,"
okay? You've known me two days.

1219
01:22:53,290 --> 01:22:56,626
Two days. Now we're on our way
down to go break up your marriage.

1220
01:22:58,587 --> 01:23:00,589
That has nothing to do with you.

1221
01:23:00,630 --> 01:23:03,300
I don't believe you.

1222
01:23:05,802 --> 01:23:07,888
I don't either.

1223
01:23:26,573 --> 01:23:29,075
Amanda is beginning to gather
strength as it continues...

1224
01:23:29,110 --> 01:23:30,994
its journey in the Atlantic.

1225
01:23:31,036 --> 01:23:33,747
It's currently a category two hurricane.

1226
01:23:36,750 --> 01:23:39,961
The hurricane is continuing
its push towards the northwest,

1227
01:23:40,003 --> 01:23:44,090
and that means the coastlines
of Georgia and South Carolina-

1228
01:23:45,425 --> 01:23:48,762
He'll make it.

1229
01:24:01,066 --> 01:24:04,361
That's it right there. Yep.

1230
01:24:04,402 --> 01:24:06,363
- Oh, my God, that's Carl.
- Carl?

1231
01:24:07,864 --> 01:24:09,950
My husband.

1232
01:24:15,163 --> 01:24:18,250
Surprise, sweetheart. Who's this?

1233
01:24:18,291 --> 01:24:22,546
I know it's not the guy you're trying to
sell the place to, 'cause I got an injunction.

1234
01:24:22,587 --> 01:24:24,714
Bullshit.

1235
01:24:28,802 --> 01:24:30,936
This is so fake.

1236
01:24:30,971 --> 01:24:33,473
You can't even get an
injunction that fast, all right?

1237
01:24:33,515 --> 01:24:35,433
- What are you doing this to me for?
- Carl.

1238
01:24:35,475 --> 01:24:37,477
- I have to get back pretty soon,
so- - This is my place, okay?

1239
01:24:37,512 --> 01:24:39,396
- I bought it with my money.
- Your place?

1240
01:24:39,437 --> 01:24:41,606
- Yeah.
- For chrissakes, Sarah, we're married.

1241
01:24:41,648 --> 01:24:45,951
You wanna sell the place? That's
fine, we'll sell the place.

1242
01:24:45,986 --> 01:24:49,114
You can send the money down to your
kid it that's what your worried about.

1243
01:24:49,155 --> 01:24:51,164
Now, come on.

1244
01:24:51,199 --> 01:24:54,160
Come on, angel. You
got no place else to go.

1245
01:24:55,287 --> 01:24:57,664
I'm not going, Carl.

1246
01:24:57,706 --> 01:24:59,875
You ungrateful bitch.

1247
01:24:59,916 --> 01:25:02,043
- What?
- Hey. Hold on.

1248
01:25:02,085 --> 01:25:05,762
- Nobody's talking to you, my friend.
- Okay. Just cool it.

1249
01:25:05,797 --> 01:25:08,592
- Sarah, get in the car.
- I'm not going, Carl. Forget it. Not going.

1250
01:25:08,633 --> 01:25:11,344
- I said get in the car, now!
- No, I'm not getting in the car!

1251
01:25:11,386 --> 01:25:13,388
Goddamn you. Hey, what's your problem?

1252
01:25:13,430 --> 01:25:15,265
You sleep with her and you
think that means something?

1253
01:25:15,307 --> 01:25:17,601
- You don't know what you're
talking about. - Don't you tell me-

1254
01:25:17,642 --> 01:25:22,355
- Ohh!
- You all right? You okay?

1255
01:25:22,397 --> 01:25:24,858
- Did you find my thumb?
- Get outta here, Carl.

1256
01:25:24,900 --> 01:25:27,242
- Go! Go!
- You know, I got news for you, buddy.

1257
01:25:27,277 --> 01:25:29,738
- You're just the next number on the list.
- Just go home, man.

1258
01:25:29,779 --> 01:25:32,199
You know what happened with
her kid? What did she tell you?

1259
01:25:32,240 --> 01:25:34,159
Carl, don't. Carl, don't.

1260
01:25:34,201 --> 01:25:36,161
- She let the dad raise him? Well, that's bullshit!
- Shut up.

1261
01:25:36,203 --> 01:25:39,080
The kid chose the father.

1262
01:25:40,457 --> 01:25:43,001
She was never even around.

1263
01:25:43,043 --> 01:25:45,337
But even a
six-year-old could see.

1264
01:25:45,378 --> 01:25:48,465
You can't trust her.

1265
01:25:48,506 --> 01:25:51,593
Enjoy the ride, pal.

1266
01:26:07,651 --> 01:26:10,987
- Hey, are you okay?
- Yeah.

1267
01:26:15,992 --> 01:26:21,414
Oh, Jesus. Now I can't even go see him.

1268
01:26:21,456 --> 01:26:23,291
Who? Your little boy?

1269
01:26:25,794 --> 01:26:30,340
Hey.

1270
01:26:30,382 --> 01:26:33,385
- Why? Because of $25,000?
- Yeah.

1271
01:26:33,426 --> 01:26:36,805
Aw, Sarah.

1272
01:26:36,846 --> 01:26:40,559
I don't know anything
about raising kids,

1273
01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:43,603
but I don't think $25,000
is gonna win him over.

1274
01:26:43,645 --> 01:26:46,648
I think he wants to see you.

1275
01:26:48,858 --> 01:26:53,321
Can't win him over. He obviously
doesn't want what I have to offer.

1276
01:26:55,740 --> 01:26:59,202
Sarah, you have the most
incredible ability...

1277
01:26:59,244 --> 01:27:02,434
to make people absolutely
crazy about you.

1278
01:27:02,469 --> 01:27:05,625
No, I have the ability
to make people crazy.

1279
01:27:05,667 --> 01:27:08,003
That's what I can do. Really well.

1280
01:27:08,044 --> 01:27:11,214
Sarah, everybody loves you.

1281
01:27:11,256 --> 01:27:14,342
You just-

1282
01:27:14,384 --> 01:27:16,970
You just think they're all wrong.

1283
01:27:20,640 --> 01:27:24,060
When does your wedding start?

1284
01:27:53,089 --> 01:27:55,175
Well.

1285
01:27:57,344 --> 01:28:00,513
Seventeen minutes late.

1286
01:28:00,555 --> 01:28:03,475
Ben's usually very prompt.

1287
01:28:03,516 --> 01:28:07,354
You must be so very proud of him.

1288
01:28:09,940 --> 01:28:12,984
I hate to interrupt, but
I think the hurricane...

1289
01:28:13,026 --> 01:28:15,779
may arrive before the groom.

1290
01:28:15,820 --> 01:28:18,406
Good Lord.

1291
01:28:20,367 --> 01:28:22,452
Ben, where are you?

1292
01:29:11,293 --> 01:29:14,421
Look, we'll-

1293
01:29:16,256 --> 01:29:19,009
I just wanna get my
bearings here for a second.

1294
01:29:19,044 --> 01:29:21,052
Okay.

1295
01:29:21,094 --> 01:29:24,980
- Well.
- All right.

1296
01:29:25,015 --> 01:29:28,914
Two strangers arrive at a
wedding. One invited, one is not.

1297
01:29:28,949 --> 01:29:32,814
And as the guests arrive and
the appetizers are served,

1298
01:29:32,856 --> 01:29:37,110
the true drama unfolds
just minutes from the altar.

1299
01:29:39,112 --> 01:29:41,823
I don't think I'm gonna be able
to blurb my way out of this one.

1300
01:29:43,783 --> 01:29:47,662
Nope. Probably not.

1301
01:29:49,414 --> 01:29:52,090
Okay. All right.

1302
01:29:52,125 --> 01:29:55,545
I'm just gonna run in there...

1303
01:29:55,587 --> 01:30:00,050
just put a quick stop to this
whole wedding thing, you know.

1304
01:30:00,091 --> 01:30:03,386
Maybe grab a few gifts on the way out.

1305
01:30:03,428 --> 01:30:06,473
- You need anything?
Bread maker? - Um-

1306
01:30:06,514 --> 01:30:09,559
- Cuisinart?
- No, no, I think I'm good.

1307
01:30:09,601 --> 01:30:11,561
Yeah.

1308
01:30:17,567 --> 01:30:21,029
You will be here when
I come back, won't you?

1309
01:30:21,071 --> 01:30:25,492
Oh, well, you know me.

1310
01:30:27,994 --> 01:30:30,080
I would not presume.

1311
01:30:32,499 --> 01:30:36,836
All right. Wish me luck.

1312
01:30:36,878 --> 01:30:42,008
Ben, do me a favor and just
forget about luck, okay?

1313
01:30:42,043 --> 01:30:46,346
Forget about loyalty, forget about...

1314
01:30:46,388 --> 01:30:50,642
being nice, forget about polite, okay?

1315
01:30:52,185 --> 01:30:56,606
Because this is the rest of your
life and possibly somebody else's too.

1316
01:30:56,641 --> 01:30:58,775
- Yeah.
- You know?

1317
01:30:58,817 --> 01:31:00,819
Yeah.

1318
01:31:00,860 --> 01:31:03,780
Just be honest.

1319
01:31:05,115 --> 01:31:09,369
If her father happens to
shoot me on my way out,

1320
01:31:09,411 --> 01:31:13,421
I guess I'll see you in heaven.

1321
01:31:13,456 --> 01:31:16,376
Yeah. I don't think I deserve heaven.

1322
01:31:17,544 --> 01:31:20,005
Ah, Sarah.

1323
01:31:20,046 --> 01:31:24,634
You deserve so much more than you think.

1324
01:31:24,676 --> 01:31:28,346
You deserve to be with somebody...

1325
01:31:28,388 --> 01:31:32,058
who will be really, really
depressed if your plane goes down.

1326
01:32:07,510 --> 01:32:10,263
- Hey, Ben.
- Hey, man, what happened to you?

1327
01:32:10,305 --> 01:32:12,974
What, did you go swimming?

1328
01:32:13,016 --> 01:32:15,393
- Ben! Honey, honey, come on.
- I have to talk to you!

1329
01:32:15,435 --> 01:32:18,021
- Dad, I can't right now.
- We just want to talk to you for a minute.

1330
01:32:18,063 --> 01:32:20,607
- I can't right now! -
Benjamin! - Get in there!

1331
01:32:22,609 --> 01:32:24,611
- All right, Benjamin.
- Barbara, please.

1332
01:32:24,646 --> 01:32:26,530
I want you to listen to your father.

1333
01:32:26,571 --> 01:32:29,032
- Ben? We were thinking about...
- Yes.

1334
01:32:29,074 --> 01:32:31,416
what you were telling us on the phone,

1335
01:32:31,451 --> 01:32:35,747
and the thing is, nobody
knows if it's gonna work out.

1336
01:32:35,789 --> 01:32:37,791
It's all a leap of faith.

1337
01:32:37,832 --> 01:32:42,546
It just so happened that
in my case, I was lucky.

1338
01:32:42,581 --> 01:32:46,716
My heart told me to
do something, I did it,

1339
01:32:46,751 --> 01:32:49,928
and 32 years later, here I am.

1340
01:32:51,888 --> 01:32:55,141
Don't speak. You'll ruin the moment.

1341
01:33:03,984 --> 01:33:06,451
You have got a lot of nerve!

1342
01:33:06,486 --> 01:33:09,322
Now, maybe this is how they
treat women back in New York,

1343
01:33:09,364 --> 01:33:12,158
but here in Savannah, we
have a little more respect...

1344
01:33:12,193 --> 01:33:14,494
for the sanctity of marriage.

1345
01:33:14,536 --> 01:33:17,914
- Oh, do you hear yourself?
- I am not talking to you, Virginia!

1346
01:33:17,956 --> 01:33:21,167
- Where's Bridget? I want to marry her.
- Who the hell are you?

1347
01:33:21,209 --> 01:33:24,803
- Someone who gets to a wedding on time!
- Hi, we haven't met. I'm Ben.

1348
01:33:24,838 --> 01:33:28,717
Steve Montgomery. I used to go out with
Bridget and I'm still in love with her.

1349
01:33:28,758 --> 01:33:30,886
- Can I see your invitation?
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!

1350
01:33:30,927 --> 01:33:33,722
Excuse me! Somebody should be asking
for your invitation, all right?

1351
01:33:33,763 --> 01:33:37,225
P.S.
- you shouldn't even be having a wedding!

1352
01:33:37,267 --> 01:33:41,521
- I saw him in the hotel last night with some woman!
- Whoa! Hey, untrue!

1353
01:33:41,563 --> 01:33:45,525
They are just travel
friends. And she's ugly!

1354
01:33:51,948 --> 01:33:55,118
Why do you New Yorkers
have to be so unpleasant?

1355
01:33:55,153 --> 01:33:57,621
- I like New York.
- Put 'em up!

1356
01:35:01,434 --> 01:35:05,230
- Ben?
- Yeah?

1357
01:35:05,272 --> 01:35:09,943
Um, in about five minutes, we're
supposed to be joined for eternity,

1358
01:35:09,985 --> 01:35:12,737
and I was wondering...

1359
01:35:12,779 --> 01:35:15,866
if you were gonna get dressed.

1360
01:35:15,907 --> 01:35:18,667
Well, if it's eternity, it can wait.

1361
01:35:18,702 --> 01:35:21,454
No, no, I think technically
eternity starts immediately,

1362
01:35:21,489 --> 01:35:24,666
especially when there's
ice sculpture involved.

1363
01:35:24,708 --> 01:35:27,794
- Well, Bridge.
- Yeah.

1364
01:35:31,131 --> 01:35:33,216
The truth is-

1365
01:35:40,390 --> 01:35:42,976
I'm sorry.

1366
01:35:43,018 --> 01:35:46,730
This always happens
at weddings, you know?

1367
01:35:46,771 --> 01:35:49,274
I'm sorry I took so long to get
down here. Something happened.

1368
01:35:49,316 --> 01:35:51,443
It's okay. I know.

1369
01:35:51,484 --> 01:35:54,571
Debbie told me, and I told her that
it didn't matter because I trusted you,

1370
01:35:54,613 --> 01:35:57,782
and I knew you wouldn't cheat on me.

1371
01:35:57,824 --> 01:36:03,038
And then I threw up. But, um
- Everything else was going wrong.

1372
01:36:03,079 --> 01:36:05,665
Everything was going wrong,
and my parents are separated,

1373
01:36:05,700 --> 01:36:07,834
and then this guy Steve, who-

1374
01:36:07,876 --> 01:36:09,794
Bridge, you know what?

1375
01:36:09,836 --> 01:36:13,590
I always thought that there was this one
perfect person for everybody in the world.

1376
01:36:13,625 --> 01:36:16,224
And when you found that person,

1377
01:36:16,259 --> 01:36:19,304
like the rest of the world just
kind of magically faded away...

1378
01:36:19,346 --> 01:36:23,350
and the two of you would
just be inside this kind of...

1379
01:36:23,391 --> 01:36:26,102
protective bubble,
but there is no bubble.

1380
01:36:26,144 --> 01:36:28,647
I mean, or if there
is, we have to make it.

1381
01:36:28,688 --> 01:36:34,194
I just think that life is more
than a series of moments, you know?

1382
01:36:35,695 --> 01:36:39,533
We can make choices, and we can
choose to protect the people we love,

1383
01:36:39,574 --> 01:36:42,953
and that's what makes us who we
are, and those are the real miracles.

1384
01:36:42,994 --> 01:36:45,830
Stop me when it just becomes glaringly
obvious that I have no idea...

1385
01:36:45,872 --> 01:36:48,708
- what I'm talking about.
- No, I know what you're talking about.

1386
01:36:48,750 --> 01:36:51,127
I do. I know exactly
what you're talking about.

1387
01:37:00,595 --> 01:37:03,390
Farewell, Ben.

1388
01:37:14,568 --> 01:37:17,118
I fell in love with you
the moment I saw you.

1389
01:37:17,153 --> 01:37:21,241
And when I saw you up there on the balcony,
I fell in love with you all over again.

1390
01:37:21,283 --> 01:37:25,078
None of the plane crashes
and the hurricanes...

1391
01:37:25,120 --> 01:37:28,797
and the other people
will ever change that.

1392
01:37:28,832 --> 01:37:31,918
Because when I'm on my
deathbed, I'm gonna know...

1393
01:37:31,960 --> 01:37:35,005
that I married the only
woman I ever really loved.

1394
01:37:38,341 --> 01:37:40,844
I think you just wrote your vows.

1395
01:37:43,763 --> 01:37:46,683
I love you so much.

1396
01:38:12,125 --> 01:38:16,213
- Get her out of the rain!
- Guys, hold on.

1397
01:38:16,248 --> 01:38:20,258
You guys, it's only rain.

1398
01:38:33,396 --> 01:38:35,982
All right, all right.

1399
01:38:46,743 --> 01:38:49,746
I'm okay. I'll be right back.

1400
01:38:49,788 --> 01:38:52,791
- It's okay.
- Bridge! Bridget!

1401
01:38:54,459 --> 01:38:56,419
You wanna get married like this?

1402
01:38:58,421 --> 01:39:03,218
Let's go get married...
under a waterfall in Hawaii!

1403
01:39:03,260 --> 01:39:06,346
- Okay.
- Okay. Let's go.

1404
01:39:13,228 --> 01:39:16,856
Morning smiles

1405
01:39:16,898 --> 01:39:20,485
Like the face

1406
01:39:20,527 --> 01:39:25,427
Of a newborn child

1407
01:39:25,462 --> 01:39:30,328
Better said unknowing

1408
01:39:33,665 --> 01:39:37,676
Rejoicing

1409
01:39:37,711 --> 01:39:44,301
From the sight of a long lost friend

1410
01:39:46,303 --> 01:39:49,723
Speaks to me of course

1411
01:39:52,559 --> 01:39:55,729
But I feel

1412
01:39:55,770 --> 01:39:59,399
I have nothing to give

1413
01:40:01,401 --> 01:40:06,323
I have so much to lose here

1414
01:40:06,358 --> 01:40:08,540
In this lonely place

1415
01:40:08,575 --> 01:40:13,788
Tangled up in our embrace

1416
01:40:13,830 --> 01:40:19,961
It's nothing I'm not feeling how to fall

1417
01:40:22,172 --> 01:40:27,219
Wind in tow

1418
01:40:27,260 --> 01:40:34,226
Grapes the flow trembling on the vine

1419
01:40:34,267 --> 01:40:37,896
- Nothing needs to shelter
- Don't hit my house, bad lightning.

1420
01:40:37,938 --> 01:40:39,731
You're gonna burn us down!

1421
01:40:39,773 --> 01:40:44,236
But I feel

1422
01:40:44,277 --> 01:40:49,115
I have nothing to give

1423
01:40:49,157 --> 01:40:52,118
Well, there's one quote
that pretty much sums it up.

1424
01:40:52,160 --> 01:40:55,622
It's from a bishop in the 16th century.

1425
01:40:55,664 --> 01:40:58,750
He said, "Marriage has less beauty...

1426
01:40:58,792 --> 01:41:02,170
but more safety than the single life.

1427
01:41:02,212 --> 01:41:05,549
It's full of sorrows and full of joys.

1428
01:41:05,584 --> 01:41:07,676
It lies under more burdens,

1429
01:41:07,717 --> 01:41:11,137
but it is supported by
all the strengths of love.

1430
01:41:11,179 --> 01:41:15,433
And those burdens are delightful. "

1431
01:41:15,475 --> 01:41:17,477
I have nothing to give

1432
01:41:17,519 --> 01:41:21,022
Sometimes the people we
meet change us forever.

1433
01:41:21,064 --> 01:41:25,652
I've never forgotten Sarah, and
I'm pretty sure I never will.

1434
01:41:25,694 --> 01:41:29,823
Wherever she is, I
really hope she's happy.

1435
01:41:31,908 --> 01:41:35,871
In the end, all you can do is
commit to the people you love,

1436
01:41:35,912 --> 01:41:38,039
hope for a little luck...

1437
01:41:38,081 --> 01:41:40,166
and some good weather.

1438
01:41:52,345 --> 01:41:55,140
Hearts gone astray

1439
01:41:55,181 --> 01:42:00,061
Keeping hurt when they go

1440
01:42:00,103 --> 01:42:02,647
I went away

1441
01:42:02,689 --> 01:42:07,569
Just when you needed me so

1442
01:42:07,611 --> 01:42:10,238
You won't regret

1443
01:42:10,280 --> 01:42:15,285
I'll come back begging you

1444
01:42:15,327 --> 01:42:17,836
Don't you forget

1445
01:42:17,871 --> 01:42:22,375
Welcome love we once knew

1446
01:42:22,417 --> 01:42:24,836
Yeah

1447
01:42:24,878 --> 01:42:28,680
Where life's river
flows No one really knows

1448
01:42:28,715 --> 01:42:32,719
You're someone left to
show the way to lasting love

1449
01:42:32,754 --> 01:42:36,556
Like the sun it shines
Endlessly it shines

1450
01:42:36,598 --> 01:42:40,060
You always will be my eternal love

1451
01:42:40,101 --> 01:42:44,064
Whenever love went wrong
Ours would still be strong

1452
01:42:44,105 --> 01:42:47,609
We'd have our own Everlasting love

1453
01:42:47,651 --> 01:42:55,283
This love will last forever

1454
01:42:55,325 --> 01:42:59,162
Open up your eyes Then you'll realize

1455
01:42:59,204 --> 01:43:02,999
You've always been my everlasting love

1456
01:43:03,041 --> 01:43:06,795
Need you by my side Come and be my bride

1457
01:43:06,836 --> 01:43:10,632
Never be denied Everlasting love

1458
01:43:10,674 --> 01:43:15,178
From the very start Open up your heart

1459
01:43:15,220 --> 01:43:19,724
Feel the love you got Everlasting love

1460
01:43:19,766 --> 01:43:21,601
Everlasting love

1461
01:43:29,943 --> 01:43:34,948
If you're dumb and confused

1462
01:43:34,990 --> 01:43:37,409
And you don't remember

1463
01:43:37,450 --> 01:43:39,870
Who you're talking to

1464
01:43:39,905 --> 01:43:41,997
Concentration

1465
01:43:42,038 --> 01:43:44,499
Just seems to fade

1466
01:43:44,541 --> 01:43:48,378
'Cause your baby is too far away

1467
01:43:50,046 --> 01:43:54,926
There's a rose in a fisted glove

1468
01:43:54,968 --> 01:43:59,604
And the eagle flies with the dove

1469
01:43:59,639 --> 01:44:03,101
And if you can't be
with the one you love

1470
01:44:03,143 --> 01:44:07,063
Honey, love the one you're with

1471
01:44:13,945 --> 01:44:16,239
Don't be angry

1472
01:44:16,281 --> 01:44:18,658
Don't be sad

1473
01:44:18,700 --> 01:44:20,994
Don't sit quiet

1474
01:44:21,036 --> 01:44:23,371
Good times you had

1475
01:44:23,413 --> 01:44:25,916
'Cause there's a girl

1476
01:44:25,957 --> 01:44:28,293
Right next to you

1477
01:44:28,335 --> 01:44:31,046
She's just waiting

1478
01:44:31,087 --> 01:44:33,715
For something to do

1479
01:44:33,757 --> 01:44:38,595
There's a rose in a fisted glove

1480
01:44:38,637 --> 01:44:43,225
And the eagle flies with the dove

1481
01:44:43,266 --> 01:44:46,686
And if you can't be
with the one you love

1482
01:44:46,728 --> 01:44:48,980
Honey, love the one you're with

1483
01:45:03,036 --> 01:45:05,372
Do-do-do-do
do-do-do-do

1484
01:45:05,455 --> 01:45:10,377
Do-do-do-do
do-do-do-do

1485
01:45:12,128 --> 01:45:14,464
Turn your heartache

1486
01:45:14,506 --> 01:45:16,800
Right into stone

1487
01:45:16,841 --> 01:45:19,135
'Cause she's a girl

1488
01:45:19,170 --> 01:45:21,471
A girl alone

1489
01:45:21,513 --> 01:45:23,974
So get it together

1490
01:45:24,015 --> 01:45:26,268
And you can fight

1491
01:45:26,309 --> 01:45:30,480
You're not gonna need any more goodbye

1492
01:45:31,940 --> 01:45:36,778
There's a rose in a fisted glove

1493
01:45:36,820 --> 01:45:41,373
And the eagle flies with the dove

1494
01:45:41,408 --> 01:45:44,870
And if you can't be
with the one you love

1495
01:45:44,911 --> 01:45:47,664
Honey, love the one you're with
