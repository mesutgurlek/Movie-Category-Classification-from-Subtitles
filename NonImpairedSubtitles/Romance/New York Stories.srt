1
00:01:11,167 --> 00:01:15,126
We skipped the light fandango

2
00:01:17,247 --> 00:01:20,444
Turnedcartwheels ´cross the floor

3
00:01:23,367 --> 00:01:25,927
l wasfeeling kindofseasick

4
00:01:29,807 --> 00:01:33,038
But the crowdcalledout formore

5
00:01:35,927 --> 00:01:38,646
The room washummingharder

6
00:01:41,847 --> 00:01:44,759
As the ceiling flewaway

7
00:01:47,647 --> 00:01:49,922
How´s it going?

8
00:01:54,567 --> 00:01:57,161
Had your lunch yet?

9
00:01:58,847 --> 00:02:01,236
I heard these two kids
in a restaurant yesterday.

10
00:02:01,327 --> 00:02:03,363
One said,
"What´s chocolate pudding?´´

11
00:02:03,447 --> 00:02:06,086
The other said, "It´s good.
It´s a lot like chocolate mousse.´´

12
00:02:09,367 --> 00:02:11,722
Why do I get this feeling
I´m not seeing any work today?

13
00:02:11,807 --> 00:02:15,277
There´s nothin´ to see.
It´s "The Emperor´s New Clothes.´´
I´m gonna get slaughtered, man.

14
00:02:15,367 --> 00:02:17,881
- Yeah, well, let me see what you got.
I´m sure it´s a lot--
-Just trust me on this. It´s shit.

15
00:02:17,967 --> 00:02:20,276
I´m in here, all I want to do
is lay down. I´m takin´ a dive.

16
00:02:20,367 --> 00:02:23,564
Well, ifyou can´t work, at least
you can eat. Come out with me.

17
00:02:23,647 --> 00:02:26,923
I can´t. I have to pick up
my assistant at the airport.

18
00:02:27,007 --> 00:02:29,077
I don´t know why she can´t
take a cab like everybody else.

19
00:02:29,167 --> 00:02:32,557
- But, you know--
- Whatever.

20
00:02:32,647 --> 00:02:37,038
So, uh, when would think would be
a good time for me to come back?

21
00:02:37,127 --> 00:02:39,925
The show´s in three weeks,
you know.

22
00:02:43,167 --> 00:02:46,477
Oh, Lionel, Lionel, you go
through this before every show.

23
00:02:46,567 --> 00:02:49,081
I´m talking 20 years ofthis!

24
00:02:49,167 --> 00:02:50,998
Now get to know yourself
a little better!

25
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:54,079
You can pull it off, Lionel.
You always do!

26
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:04,481
Andso it was

27
00:03:04,567 --> 00:03:07,161
That later

28
00:03:09,287 --> 00:03:12,643
As the millertoldhis tale

29
00:03:15,647 --> 00:03:18,923
That herface at firstjustghostly

30
00:03:20,007 --> 00:03:25,479
Turneda whitershade ofpale

31
00:03:39,607 --> 00:03:41,165
Shit!

32
00:03:41,247 --> 00:03:43,158
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?

33
00:03:43,247 --> 00:03:46,239
I thought I´d pickyou up so you
don´t have to hassle with cabs.

34
00:03:46,327 --> 00:03:48,602
- Didn´t you get my message?
- What?

35
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:50,962
I left it on the machine.
I said I´m not coming back.

36
00:03:51,047 --> 00:03:54,403
What do you mean, you´re not
comin´ back? You´re right here.
I´d call that comin´ back.

37
00:03:54,487 --> 00:03:57,365
- You should listen to
your machine now and then.
- "Listen to your machine´´?

38
00:03:57,447 --> 00:04:01,360
Doesn´t that have a horrifying
ring to it, that expression,
to listen to your machine?

39
00:04:03,287 --> 00:04:07,121
Look, I-- I didn´t go to Florida
with a girlfriend like I told you.

40
00:04:08,207 --> 00:04:10,482
Oh, yeah?

41
00:04:10,567 --> 00:04:12,603
I went with somebody else.

42
00:04:15,127 --> 00:04:17,038
A guy?

43
00:04:20,367 --> 00:04:23,518
- So? So what? Who´s the guy?
Did he come offthe plane with you?
- Why? You want to give him a lift home?

44
00:04:23,607 --> 00:04:26,838
Well, I´d be lyin´ if I said
I wasn´t curious to see what
kind of man rings your bell.

45
00:04:26,927 --> 00:04:30,078
- Look, he´s not here.
- What do you mean, he´s not here?
What´d he do? Take a goddam Greyhound?

46
00:04:30,167 --> 00:04:34,206
We had a fiight. He left me. I spent most
ofthe time down there by myself, okay?

47
00:04:34,287 --> 00:04:36,198
- He left me, okay?
- He left you?

48
00:04:36,287 --> 00:04:38,596
He left you?
Who is he?

49
00:04:38,687 --> 00:04:40,962
I mean, who in their right mind
would leave you? Who is this guy?

50
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:43,800
I know him, right?

51
00:04:43,887 --> 00:04:46,003
Gregory Stark.

52
00:04:46,087 --> 00:04:48,362
That kid?
The comedian?

53
00:04:48,447 --> 00:04:50,438
- A performance artist.
- Performance artist.

54
00:04:50,527 --> 00:04:54,440
What the hell is a performance artist?
A person´s an actor, a singer, a dancer.

55
00:04:54,527 --> 00:04:58,042
I mean, do you call the guy that picks
up your garbage a sanitary engineer?

56
00:04:58,127 --> 00:05:00,800
A performance artist.
And he left you?

57
00:05:00,887 --> 00:05:03,560
- Now, you see through that, right?
- I don´t care. It´s over.

58
00:05:03,647 --> 00:05:05,638
That´s all.

59
00:05:05,727 --> 00:05:08,002
Look, I´m moving out.

60
00:05:08,087 --> 00:05:10,237
That´s what
"I´m not coming back´´ means.

61
00:05:12,207 --> 00:05:14,926
Where you gonna go?

62
00:05:15,007 --> 00:05:17,601
What can you afford?

63
00:05:17,687 --> 00:05:19,803
You gonna move into a dormitory?

64
00:05:22,727 --> 00:05:24,957
You don´t want to sleep with me
any more? Hey, I´m a big boy.

65
00:05:25,047 --> 00:05:28,164
You don´t have to go out on the street.
You had a fling. Big deal.

66
00:05:28,247 --> 00:05:33,116
Welcome to the world. I mean, we´re
still employer and employee, right?

67
00:05:35,247 --> 00:05:39,923
I´m leaving New York.
I wanna go home.

68
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:42,362
Ah, yeah, well...

69
00:05:42,447 --> 00:05:44,722
that´s a whole
´nother ball o´ wax.

70
00:05:49,127 --> 00:05:52,085
You want to split? Fine.
Come back, pack up and go.

71
00:05:52,167 --> 00:05:54,123
Ifyou drag it out, I´ll die.
You know that.

72
00:05:54,207 --> 00:05:56,004
Come on.
Let´s get it over with.

73
00:06:02,767 --> 00:06:05,918
Shesaidthere isno reason

74
00:06:08,687 --> 00:06:11,406
Andthe truth isplain to see

75
00:06:14,847 --> 00:06:18,237
But l wanderedthrough
myplaying cards

76
00:06:20,967 --> 00:06:24,118
And wouldnot let herbe

77
00:06:26,927 --> 00:06:30,363
One of16 vestal virgins

78
00:06:33,367 --> 00:06:35,961
Who were leaving forthe coast

79
00:06:39,487 --> 00:06:43,366
Andalthough my eyes were open

80
00:06:45,567 --> 00:06:48,877
Theymightjust as well
have been closed

81
00:06:48,967 --> 00:06:53,279
Andso it was

82
00:06:53,367 --> 00:06:56,518
That later

83
00:07:12,727 --> 00:07:15,400
- You know, I can´t believe
I´ve never noticed that in here.
-Jesus!

84
00:07:15,487 --> 00:07:18,047
Has this always been in here?

85
00:07:19,887 --> 00:07:22,924
Incredibly handsome kid.
Beautiful boy.

86
00:07:23,007 --> 00:07:26,204
I can understand the attraction.

87
00:07:26,287 --> 00:07:28,198
Did you ever see him perform?

88
00:07:28,287 --> 00:07:30,357
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

89
00:07:30,447 --> 00:07:32,642
How in the hell can you let somebody
like that drive you out of New York?

90
00:07:32,727 --> 00:07:35,764
-I thought you had more spine than that.
-He´sjust some guy.

91
00:07:35,847 --> 00:07:38,680
He´s not driving me out.

92
00:07:40,807 --> 00:07:42,763
It´s not him.

93
00:07:44,007 --> 00:07:47,363
- It´s me?
- It´s nobody. It´s things.

94
00:07:47,447 --> 00:07:50,359
- Things? What things?
- Don´t you reason with me!

95
00:07:50,447 --> 00:07:53,757
What about your painting?
Huh?

96
00:07:53,847 --> 00:07:57,203
You gonna make a little studio
in your parents´ garage...

97
00:07:57,287 --> 00:07:59,676
with rusty hedge clippers
hanging on a nail...

98
00:07:59,767 --> 00:08:02,235
and pool stuff
laying in the corner...

99
00:08:02,327 --> 00:08:05,319
and a broken sled and mice?

100
00:08:05,407 --> 00:08:07,204
You work for Lionel Dobie.

101
00:08:07,287 --> 00:08:09,881
You work for the lion, baby.

102
00:08:09,967 --> 00:08:12,561
You stretch canvases.
You run a few errands.

103
00:08:12,647 --> 00:08:16,560
You got your own room, studio,
life lessons that are priceless...

104
00:08:16,647 --> 00:08:18,842
plus a salary.

105
00:08:18,927 --> 00:08:24,285
And ifyou act now, you´ll also receive
a handsome sterling service for 24.

106
00:08:24,367 --> 00:08:28,280
Look, I´m not kidding.
This kills me, you leaving.

107
00:08:29,367 --> 00:08:31,483
It´s a suicide.

108
00:08:31,567 --> 00:08:34,161
This is a time and a place.

109
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:39,526
At your age, you´re right in
the heart ofthe heart, Paulette.

110
00:08:39,607 --> 00:08:43,395
I swear, you walk now, you´ll curse
yourselfthe rest ofyour days.

111
00:08:51,287 --> 00:08:53,847
I don´t have to sleep
with you any more?

112
00:08:57,567 --> 00:09:01,355
Baby, I´m your ally
against horse dung and fraud.

113
00:09:01,447 --> 00:09:03,483
That´s as far as it goes
from now on.

114
00:09:35,607 --> 00:09:39,077
We skippedthe light fandango

115
00:09:41,687 --> 00:09:44,804

- Ow! Lionel, for God´s sakes!

119
00:10:04,007 --> 00:10:06,475
Sorry.

120
00:10:06,567 --> 00:10:09,206
As the ceiling flewaway

121
00:10:12,207 --> 00:10:17,235
When we calledout
foranotherdrink

122
00:10:18,407 --> 00:10:21,763
The waiterbrought a tray

123
00:10:21,847 --> 00:10:26,045
Andso it was

124
00:10:26,127 --> 00:10:28,482
That later

125
00:10:28,567 --> 00:10:30,797
Is the music too loud?

126
00:10:30,887 --> 00:10:33,845
- Uh-uh.
-As the millertoldhis tale

127
00:10:35,207 --> 00:10:39,758
- You should get some sleep.
- That herface at firstjustghostly
- I´m working on it.

Turneda whitershade ofpale

129
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:51,518
You´re gonna sleep like that,
you should shut this.

130
00:10:51,607 --> 00:10:54,041
Otherwise, come 4:00 or 5:00
in the morning, you´ll be freezing.

131
00:10:56,207 --> 00:10:58,118
Sorry.

132
00:11:00,367 --> 00:11:03,484
Can I, uh, get you anything?

133
00:11:03,567 --> 00:11:06,479
- Soup?
- "Soup´´?

134
00:11:06,567 --> 00:11:08,876
Who are you talking to?

135
00:11:08,967 --> 00:11:10,878
I don´t care.

136
00:11:14,487 --> 00:11:16,876
He´s driving me crazy.

137
00:11:50,047 --> 00:11:54,325
Heythere, now, baby

138
00:11:54,407 --> 00:11:56,921

What mypoliticsare

143
00:12:32,087 --> 00:12:34,282
- Don´t you knock?
- I did. I thought you said, "Come in.´´

144
00:12:34,367 --> 00:12:37,916
I´m sorry, I--
I think I left my sable brush in here.

145
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:40,077
- Did you see it?
- What are you doing?

146
00:12:40,167 --> 00:12:44,524
- I could´ve sworn that I left it--
- I´m not sleeping with you.
You promised.

147
00:12:49,087 --> 00:12:51,726
What?

148
00:12:51,807 --> 00:12:54,640
Jesus, you know what? This is crazy.
I just had this impulse.

149
00:12:54,727 --> 00:12:56,638
I wanted to kiss your foot.

150
00:12:56,727 --> 00:12:59,525
- You´re nuts.
- No, no, no. I´m just working too hard.

151
00:12:59,607 --> 00:13:01,996
I´m just getting weird.
I´m under a lot of pressure, you know.

152
00:13:02,087 --> 00:13:04,885
Phillip´s is hanging over my head
every day. "The show´s in three weeks.

153

Show´s in three weeks.
Show´s in three weeks.´´

154
00:13:06,967 --> 00:13:09,322
Like a goddam mockingbird
in my ear!

155
00:13:11,447 --> 00:13:13,961
I just wanted
to kiss your foot.

156
00:13:14,047 --> 00:13:18,040
I´m sorry.
It´s nothin´ personal.

157
00:13:18,127 --> 00:13:20,960
You want me to get you anything?

158
00:13:21,047 --> 00:13:25,598
That herface at firstjustghostly

do you love me?

162
00:13:55,087 --> 00:13:58,124
Love you?
I said I did, yes.

163
00:14:00,687 --> 00:14:02,723
What would you do if I left?

164
00:14:02,807 --> 00:14:04,718
What would I do?

165
00:14:05,927 --> 00:14:08,885
I´d go up on the roof
and howl like a gut-shot dog.

166
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:14,083
Well, I don´t love you.

167
00:14:15,727 --> 00:14:17,319
So what?

168
00:14:20,807 --> 00:14:24,038

00:15:24,967 --> 00:15:28,323
Well, it´sso nice

188
00:15:30,887 --> 00:15:33,924
It´s amazing how much more
interesting it´s getting.

189
00:15:34,007 --> 00:15:37,079
- What do you mean, "interesting´´?
- It´s not boring.

190
00:15:37,167 --> 00:15:40,125
You know, you got a nice
little irony working foryou.

191
00:15:40,207 --> 00:15:42,721
- Irony?
- Yeah. Nice irony.

192
00:15:44,447 --> 00:15:47,359
- How´s the tension? Last time--
- It´s nice.

193
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:50,358
- Nice?
- Yeah, nice.

194
00:15:53,767 --> 00:15:57,362
-You´re full ofshit, you know that?
-You know, you´re the only person in the
world who could say that to me and live.

195
00:15:57,447 --> 00:16:00,678
Look, could you just tell me ifyou
think I´m any good? How ´bout that?

196
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:02,997
Just tell me if-if-if...

197
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:07,080
I have any talent or ifyou
think I´m wasting my time.

198
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:10,398
Because sometimes I feel
I should just quit.

199
00:16:10,487 --> 00:16:12,637
Because--

200
00:16:13,687 --> 00:16:16,440
Just tell me what you think.
Come on.

201
00:16:20,207 --> 00:16:23,404
What the hell difference
does it matter what I think?

202
00:16:23,487 --> 00:16:25,523
It´s yours.

203
00:16:25,607 --> 00:16:27,802
I mean, you make art
because you have to.

204
00:16:27,887 --> 00:16:30,276
´Cause you got no choice.
It´s not about talent.

205
00:16:30,367 --> 00:16:33,439
It´s about no choice
but to do it.

206
00:16:33,527 --> 00:16:36,883
Now, are you any good?
Well, you´re 22, so who knows?

207
00:16:36,967 --> 00:16:40,801
Who cares?
You wanna to give it up?

208
00:16:40,887 --> 00:16:43,879
You give it up, you weren´t
a real artist to begin with.

209
00:16:46,767 --> 00:16:48,997
Christ´s sake.

210
00:16:49,087 --> 00:16:51,203
"You give it up, you weren´t
a real artist to begin with.´´

211
00:16:51,287 --> 00:16:53,881
What a stupid thing to say.
Stupid!

212
00:16:55,567 --> 00:16:57,478
Hi, Ma.

213
00:16:59,327 --> 00:17:01,238
Not so good.

214
00:17:03,127 --> 00:17:05,038
I´m not.

215
00:17:06,327 --> 00:17:08,238
I can´t.

216
00:17:11,807 --> 00:17:13,923
I want to go back to school.

217
00:17:17,967 --> 00:17:19,878
I don´t know.

218
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:24,996
Can I come home
for a little while?

219
00:17:35,367 --> 00:17:37,278
No.

220
00:17:40,807 --> 00:17:43,037
I just hate it here.

221
00:17:47,927 --> 00:17:50,122
- Nowhowdoes it feel
- Hey, Lionel.

222
00:17:51,207 --> 00:17:53,801
- Lionel!
- Howdoes it feel

223
00:17:53,887 --> 00:17:56,037
Turn the music down!

224
00:17:56,127 --> 00:18:00,120
- To be without a home
- Lionel.

225
00:18:00,207 --> 00:18:04,439
With no direction home

226
00:18:04,527 --> 00:18:07,564
Like a complete unknown

227
00:18:08,967 --> 00:18:12,039
Just like a rollingstone

228
00:18:17,807 --> 00:18:20,685

At Napoleon in rags
andthe language that he used

00:18:44,687 --> 00:18:48,043
Go to him now, he callsya

00:18:56,647 --> 00:19:00,083
To conceal

00:19:01,087 --> 00:19:02,998
Howdoes it feel

240
00:19:05,607 --> 00:19:08,201
Howdoes it feel

241
00:19:09,687 --> 00:19:11,837
To be without a home

242
00:19:14,087 --> 00:19:16,840
With no direction home

243
00:19:17,927 --> 00:19:20,805
Like a complete unknown

244
00:19:22,727 --> 00:19:24,957
Just like a rollingstone

245
00:19:42,247 --> 00:19:45,717
I appreciate you coming with me tonight.
I hate these things with a passion.

246
00:19:45,807 --> 00:19:48,685
You know this guy Wagner,
the party giver...

247
00:19:48,767 --> 00:19:50,837
he´s in real estate, right?

248
00:19:50,927 --> 00:19:53,600
Uh, he come down to
my studio one time.

249
00:19:53,687 --> 00:19:55,598
He puts his arm around
my shoulder and he says...

250
00:19:55,687 --> 00:19:58,838
"Lionel, do you understand
the importance ofJackson Pollock?´´

251
00:19:58,927 --> 00:20:01,885
Then he points out all the condos and
loft co-op conversions out the window...

252
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:05,004
and he says, "If it wasn´t forJackson,
none ofthis would be happening.´´

253
00:20:05,087 --> 00:20:07,237
Jackson, right?
His old pal.

254
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:13,638
His pal.

255
00:20:18,887 --> 00:20:22,084
You know, I haven´t had any
knock-around friends since 1 968.

256
00:20:22,167 --> 00:20:24,727
I´ve associates,
admirers, detractors...

257
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:26,763
ex-wives, rivals--

258
00:20:26,847 --> 00:20:30,965
- I have lots offriends.
- That´s a very mean thing to say to me.

259
00:20:31,047 --> 00:20:32,958
You have a string
in your hair.

260
00:20:33,047 --> 00:20:35,242
You see right
through me, don´t you?

261
00:20:36,327 --> 00:20:39,205
I was in the army.
Army intelligence.

262
00:20:39,287 --> 00:20:42,677
You see, they had me draw
Russian couples screwing.

263
00:20:42,767 --> 00:20:44,837
See, they fiigured this way,
come the next war...

264
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:48,397
they´d drop thousands ofthese drawings
behind enemy lines with the message...

265
00:20:48,487 --> 00:20:50,398
"Hey, Ivan, while you´re
out here fiightin´ democracy...

266
00:20:50,487 --> 00:20:52,876
ol´ Boris is back home
doing your wife.´´

267
00:20:52,967 --> 00:20:56,039
- How could you tell
the couples were Russians?
- Oh, I had ´em wearin´ fur hats.

268
00:20:56,127 --> 00:20:59,836
I mean, what´s the difference?
The next war was Vietnam anyhow.

269
00:20:59,927 --> 00:21:01,326
- Paulette what?
-Just Paulette.

270
00:21:01,407 --> 00:21:03,921
So, what´s it like to live
with the big man?

271
00:21:04,007 --> 00:21:07,966
-I don´t live with him. I work for him.
-She´s an artist
in her own right, right?

272
00:21:08,047 --> 00:21:11,198
- Ah, Pete, this is Paulette.
- Paulette what?

273
00:21:11,287 --> 00:21:14,802
-Just Paulette.
- Oh, yeah, you live with Lionel Dobie.

274
00:21:14,887 --> 00:21:18,277
- She works for him. She´s an artist.
- Yeah, I think it goes back, like,
to the Incas and the Aztecs, right?
- Really? Do you have visiting...

275
00:21:18,367 --> 00:21:20,801
- in your studio?
- Don´t you feel that?
- Uh, well, um--

276
00:21:20,887 --> 00:21:23,401
I, I, uh, collect
mainly ´50s stuff--

277
00:21:23,487 --> 00:21:25,762
uh, Rothko, Kline, you know.

278
00:21:25,847 --> 00:21:28,156
- But I like to keep
an ear to the rail.
- Excuse me a second.

279
00:21:28,247 --> 00:21:30,556
Oh, I-I don´t have anything
in the studio right now. I--

280
00:21:30,647 --> 00:21:34,162
- Do you have a show up somewhere?
- Uh, no, I-- I´m sort of
in between galleries.

281
00:21:34,247 --> 00:21:37,205
- Where did you show?
- Excuse me. Um, may I
speak to you a moment?

282
00:21:37,287 --> 00:21:39,357
I´ll bring her right back,
gentlemen. I promise.

283
00:21:39,447 --> 00:21:41,836
I got real good at it, all these
different sexual positions...

284
00:21:41,927 --> 00:21:43,918
and the expressions ofecstasy,
and the--

285
00:21:44,007 --> 00:21:47,044
This captain gave me
a hundred bucks for a set ofsix.

286
00:21:47,127 --> 00:21:50,324
Said it was an anniversary
present for his wife.

287
00:21:50,407 --> 00:21:52,523
It´s the fiirst stuff
I ever sold.

288
00:21:55,727 --> 00:21:59,561
- I´m sorry. I didn´t mean to be rude.
Are you an artist?
- Yes.

289
00:21:59,647 --> 00:22:02,081
Guys who were in my unit
who were in combat used to say...

290
00:22:02,167 --> 00:22:04,362
"Any day above ground´s
a good day.´´

291
00:22:07,167 --> 00:22:09,283
Do you think that´s true?

292
00:22:15,287 --> 00:22:19,439
-Who´s that short kid with the earring?
-Oh, the ladykiller? That´s Reuben Toro.

293
00:22:19,527 --> 00:22:23,839
He shows at Bendix.
He´s not bad. Nice kid too.

294
00:22:23,927 --> 00:22:26,487
- Hey, excuse me. Can I talk to you?
- Mr Lionel Dobie.

295
00:22:26,567 --> 00:22:29,445
- You know, you, sir, are like
my Willie Mays. It´s a pleasure...
- Thankyou. Can I talk to you?

296
00:22:29,527 --> 00:22:31,643
- Excuse me.
- ...to meet you.

297
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:40,837
- What?
- Shut up. Now, look now.

298
00:22:40,927 --> 00:22:44,556
I-I don´t know how to say this. I mean,
I´m not your shepherd or anything.

299
00:22:44,647 --> 00:22:47,445
- But people are laughin´
at ya out there.
- Why?

300
00:22:47,527 --> 00:22:50,564
Well, you know that greasy-haired kid
you´re dancing with?

301
00:22:50,647 --> 00:22:54,481
Well, he´s here to score and split.
I mean, he does this
everywhere he´s invited.

302
00:22:54,567 --> 00:22:56,956
He likes to fiind some innocent kid,
and then he preys upon them.

303
00:22:57,047 --> 00:23:00,483
I mean-- I mean, hey, you´re
a free agent. It´s your life.

304
00:23:00,567 --> 00:23:05,083
But I´m tellin´ ya, ifthat
low-rent hound does anything
to hurt you or humiliate you, I´ll--

305
00:23:05,167 --> 00:23:08,523
I thought you were gonna tell me
that they were laughing at me
because of my work.

306
00:23:10,207 --> 00:23:12,482
Well, this is kinda worse,
don´t you think?

307
00:23:15,767 --> 00:23:18,839
No. No, no, no, no.
Let me go out fiirst.
You stay in here a minute.

308
00:23:18,927 --> 00:23:22,476
Because if people see us go out
together, then their minds
make these leaps, you know.

309
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:24,603
- So stay here.
- Creep!
- Lionel, there you are.

310
00:23:24,687 --> 00:23:28,316
Lionel, I want you to meet Kurt Bloom.

in Berlin.

311
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:31,444

Lionel Dobie, nice to see you.

312
00:23:31,527 --> 00:23:33,563

313
00:23:33,647 --> 00:23:35,285

314
00:23:35,367 --> 00:23:37,437
- Oh.

- Yes, Rommel Gallery in Berlin.

316
00:23:39,567 --> 00:23:41,364

317
00:23:41,447 --> 00:23:43,438

318
00:23:43,527 --> 00:23:47,202

319
00:23:47,287 --> 00:23:50,836

lcan see no maze to unwind

336
00:26:42,567 --> 00:26:45,001
Oh, man, could I get a cup ofthat?
I´m dead and buried.

337
00:26:53,847 --> 00:26:56,441
Are you a graffiiti artist, Toro?

338
00:26:57,527 --> 00:26:59,643
No, I wouldn´t say that.

339
00:27:27,927 --> 00:27:30,202
It´s for theJapan House tonight.

340
00:27:30,287 --> 00:27:32,517
Listen, I´m sorry what
I said to you at the party.

341
00:27:32,607 --> 00:27:34,757
I-- I just get crazy.

342
00:27:36,607 --> 00:27:38,518
It´s beautiful.

343
00:27:38,607 --> 00:27:40,996
Look, I can´t go with you tonight.
I made other plans.

344
00:27:41,087 --> 00:27:44,284
- Oh, yeah?
- I´m going to the Blind Alley
with some girlfriends.

345
00:27:44,367 --> 00:27:47,245
Oh, yeah?
Who´s, uh, at the Blind Alley?

346
00:27:51,167 --> 00:27:53,237
I just want to show him that I don´t
give a damn any more, you know?

347
00:27:53,327 --> 00:27:56,637
I can go see him, see his stuff--
his stuff, like anybody else.

348
00:27:59,487 --> 00:28:01,284
Does that sound like
total horseshit, or what?

349
00:28:01,367 --> 00:28:04,962
No, absolutely not. I think, uh--
I think we should.

350
00:28:05,047 --> 00:28:08,960
I think we should show him
that life goes on, that he´s
not even worth avoiding.

351
00:28:09,047 --> 00:28:11,800
I-- I thinkyou have to go
right up in his face tonight.

352
00:28:11,887 --> 00:28:14,082
- I mean, right up in his face.
- I think I´d rather work.

353
00:28:14,167 --> 00:28:16,886
No, don´t use work as an excuse.
Your work´s sacred.

354
00:28:16,967 --> 00:28:19,435
- Yeah, well, maybe yours is.
- No, yours too. Yours too.

355
00:28:19,527 --> 00:28:21,677
Now, look, you go with your girlfriends,
you go with them...

356
00:28:21,767 --> 00:28:25,362
that´s like a bunch of high school girls
with a crush on some boy.

357
00:28:25,447 --> 00:28:30,316
But ify-you walk in with me,
you make an entrance with
fiirepower, with dignity.

358
00:28:32,167 --> 00:28:34,965
- What aboutJapan House?
- Now, fiirst comes our house.

359
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:40,405
I don´t know. I think-- I think
you should go right up in his face.

360
00:28:41,687 --> 00:28:45,475
See, I don´t look for trouble.
I mean, but some people do, right?

361
00:28:45,567 --> 00:28:49,480
You know, they--
they, like, walk around, you know?
They-They-They--They´re, like,
lookin´ for a-- for a fiight.

362
00:28:49,567 --> 00:28:53,719
Like, okay, I had this one guy one time.
He´s walkin´ down the street,
and he steps on my foot.

363
00:28:53,807 --> 00:28:56,799
All right, it was an accident.
He didn´t mean it, right?
But he doesn´t say anything.

364
00:28:56,887 --> 00:28:58,957
You know, so I said,
"Excuse me.´´ Yeah?

365
00:28:59,047 --> 00:29:01,607
He turns around, he says,
"Yeah, what?´´

366
00:29:01,687 --> 00:29:03,882
So okay, never mind. Forget about it.
Wha-- I mea-- Am I--

367
00:29:03,967 --> 00:29:07,926
Am I supposed to get into a fiight with
the guy because he steps on my foot?

368
00:29:08,007 --> 00:29:10,316
All right. What if I--
What if I do fiight with the guy...

369
00:29:10,407 --> 00:29:12,875
and I get lucky and I kill him?

370
00:29:12,967 --> 00:29:17,085
All right? Then, uh,
the cops come by and they say,
"Well, how come you killed this guy?´´

371
00:29:17,167 --> 00:29:19,556
I say, "Well-- Well,
he, uh, stepped on my foot.´´

372
00:29:19,647 --> 00:29:21,683
They´re gonna think I overreacted.

373
00:29:23,927 --> 00:29:29,240
See, I don´t know what it is. I woke up
today. I mean, I wake up every day.

374
00:29:29,327 --> 00:29:34,242
Today-- Today, I woke up and, uh,
I felt-- I felt really strange.

375
00:29:34,327 --> 00:29:38,605
You know? I mean, really weird,
because I wasn´t depressed.

376
00:29:38,687 --> 00:29:41,565
I wasn´t sad.
I wasn´t angry.

377
00:29:41,647 --> 00:29:44,207
On the other hand, I mean,
I wasn´t happy or good-natured.

378
00:29:44,287 --> 00:29:46,278
I just sort offelt...

379
00:29:46,367 --> 00:29:49,723
I-I-I don´t know, kind ofeven.

380
00:29:49,807 --> 00:29:52,640
Don´t get me wrong, okay?
I´m not content. I hate that.

381
00:29:52,727 --> 00:29:56,083
You know, when you say to somebody,
"Well, how are you?´´ and they go,
"Well, I´m content.´´

382
00:29:56,167 --> 00:29:59,364
I feel like saying, "Yeah, what would
you be if I smacked ya?´´ You know?

383
00:29:59,447 --> 00:30:02,962
I´d rather feel
one way or the other.

384
00:30:03,047 --> 00:30:07,518
But today, I-I-I just felt even.

385
00:30:07,607 --> 00:30:10,804
And, uh, I don´t like it.

386
00:30:25,927 --> 00:30:29,397
- Sex kick

He´s right there.

404
00:31:36,087 --> 00:31:38,681
- Hey! You feel better, right?
- Why´d you make me do that?

405
00:31:38,767 --> 00:31:40,883
- He´s a bastard!
- Look, you´re the bastard!

406
00:31:40,967 --> 00:31:42,605
I didn´t want to do that.
Why´d you make me do that?

407
00:31:42,687 --> 00:31:44,598
Me? I love you.

Kiss the driver on the mouth.
Then we´ll talk.

424
00:32:58,807 --> 00:33:01,241
What?

425
00:33:01,327 --> 00:33:04,239
Come on.
Show me how much you love me.

426
00:33:08,807 --> 00:33:12,686
- What if I do, huh?
- Then I´ll know your love is true.

427
00:33:12,767 --> 00:33:16,442
And ifyou don´t, your name
is King Bullshit, and I pack.

428
00:33:38,567 --> 00:33:42,526
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.
Check out Grizzly Adams here.

429
00:33:42,607 --> 00:33:44,598
Has he got anything?

430
00:33:44,687 --> 00:33:47,201
I don´t think so.

431
00:33:47,287 --> 00:33:50,245
Just looks like he lost his llama.

432
00:33:53,367 --> 00:33:55,756
What´s up?

433
00:33:55,847 --> 00:33:58,759
Hey. Hey-Hey, oh-ho-ho-ho.
Back away from the car, pal.

434
00:33:58,847 --> 00:34:01,281
You better back away from the car.

435
00:34:11,727 --> 00:34:13,843
Why do I get these
all the time?

436
00:34:15,007 --> 00:34:18,716
I love you too. Come on.
Take a walk, will ya?

437
00:34:39,687 --> 00:34:41,598
Is that for me?

438
00:34:42,847 --> 00:34:45,122
Is what foryou?

439
00:34:45,207 --> 00:34:47,357
You walk around
like that in front of me...

440
00:34:50,367 --> 00:34:53,439
what´s to stop me from losing control,
from just taking you?

441
00:34:55,047 --> 00:34:56,639
Taking me?

442
00:34:58,807 --> 00:35:02,766
I could do anything.
You know why?

443
00:35:02,847 --> 00:35:06,157
Because I´m nothin´ to you,
so who cares?

444
00:35:06,247 --> 00:35:10,240
I could rape you.
I could kill you.

445
00:35:10,327 --> 00:35:14,400
- I could kill myself.
- Or rape yourselfeven.

446
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:18,400
I could do anything, because I´m
nothing. I´m the invisible man with you.

447
00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:23,925
Night.

448
00:35:25,687 --> 00:35:28,918
Anything. Anything.

449
00:35:55,247 --> 00:35:57,761
- Hey, hear Heidi got a show?
- Her own show?

450
00:35:57,847 --> 00:36:00,122
- Well, it´s a group show.
- Where?

451
00:36:00,207 --> 00:36:04,837
In El Paso.
Is that Donald Dowd?

452
00:36:04,927 --> 00:36:06,679
Yep.

453
00:36:10,567 --> 00:36:14,082
- You see his show?
- I saw it with you.

454
00:36:15,167 --> 00:36:17,123
Yeah, I-- Sorry.

455
00:36:17,207 --> 00:36:20,324
Boy, I´m glad I make
such a strong impression.

456
00:36:20,407 --> 00:36:22,637
Shit!

457
00:36:28,087 --> 00:36:31,045
- Great.
- I heard he won some arts grant.

458
00:36:31,127 --> 00:36:33,561
- Yeah, from his parents.
- Yeah!

459
00:36:35,087 --> 00:36:37,476
- Hey.
- Hey.

460
00:36:37,567 --> 00:36:39,797
- How you doing?
- I´m great. How are you?

461
00:36:39,887 --> 00:36:41,798
- Good.
- Good.

462
00:36:44,287 --> 00:36:48,838
Oh, you know, I´m uh-- Got this new
piece running over at the Blind Alley.

463
00:36:48,927 --> 00:36:52,442
- You should come see it.
- She did see it, you self-absorbed,
no-talent son ofa bitch!

464
00:36:52,527 --> 00:36:55,280
- Shut up, Lionel.
- What´s your problem, man?

465
00:36:55,367 --> 00:36:58,564
Who in the hell told you you
were a human being? What the hell
do you know about the human heart?

466
00:36:58,647 --> 00:37:00,126
- You don´t even know her.
You don´t even see her.
- Lionel!
- Right.

467
00:37:00,207 --> 00:37:03,643
- What was shejust she,
just some piece ofass to you?
- Okay, stop it!
- Shut your mouth, man!

468
00:37:17,607 --> 00:37:19,518
Honey, don´t do that.

469
00:37:20,607 --> 00:37:22,598
Hey! What are you doing?
What are you doing?

470
00:37:22,687 --> 00:37:25,440
Are you punishing me?

471
00:37:25,527 --> 00:37:27,643
Punishing you?

472
00:37:27,727 --> 00:37:30,446
Listen, uh--
I got carried away. I´m sorry.

473
00:37:30,527 --> 00:37:34,156
- I-I love you.
- Look, my brother´s
driving in to pick me up.

474
00:37:34,247 --> 00:37:36,477
He´ll be here in two hours.
Stay out of my face till then!

475
00:37:36,567 --> 00:37:37,920
Wha-- Who-- Wai--
What´re you doing?

476
00:37:38,007 --> 00:37:40,123
I´m going home.
Stay out of my face!

477
00:37:40,207 --> 00:37:43,643
Home? This is New York. It´s here
foryou. I´ll-I´ll do anything foryou.

478
00:37:43,727 --> 00:37:47,117
All right, to hell with me. To hell
with me, okay? What about your painting?

479
00:37:47,207 --> 00:37:50,085
Tell me what´s here.
Don´t give me the shit about
"real artists have no choice.´´

480
00:37:50,167 --> 00:37:54,365
What´s here? Am I good?
Will I ever be good?

481
00:37:54,447 --> 00:37:57,757
Come on. Right now! Come on!

482
00:38:03,247 --> 00:38:05,158
I´m going home.

483
00:38:07,087 --> 00:38:11,922
You´re young yet.
I love you.

484
00:38:12,007 --> 00:38:15,283
Love me?
You just need me around to--

485
00:38:15,367 --> 00:38:19,406
Sometimes I feel like a human sacrifiice.
I don´t know.

486
00:38:19,487 --> 00:38:23,366
Maybe if I was as good as you, I
wouldn´t care about anybody else either.

487
00:38:23,447 --> 00:38:25,517
But I´m not, so goodbye.

488
00:38:25,607 --> 00:38:28,997
So I´m the monster, right? Well,
just what´s so hell great about you?

489
00:38:29,087 --> 00:38:31,965
- I don´t know. Nothing.
- You know, you gotta start learnin´
to like yourselfa little more.

490
00:38:32,047 --> 00:38:36,086
- Yeah, okay. I´ll try.
- But, see, you don´t think I love you,
because you don´t love yourself.

491
00:38:36,167 --> 00:38:38,158
I´ll keep that in mind.

492
00:38:38,247 --> 00:38:40,807
Okay, look, maybe it´s me.
It´s-- No, it´s me.

493
00:38:40,887 --> 00:38:42,843
You know, I indulge.
I indulge in love.

494
00:38:42,927 --> 00:38:45,202
I indulge in making my stuff,
and they feed offeach other, you know?

495
00:38:45,287 --> 00:38:48,279
And they come together at times,
but this-- this is bad.

496
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:50,835
This is selfiish.
So maybe I--

497
00:38:50,927 --> 00:38:54,158
I-I should try and be
a nice person forya.

498
00:38:54,247 --> 00:38:56,636
Maybe the key to that
is to try and stop.

499
00:38:56,727 --> 00:38:59,241
You know, just, uh, sh--
stop painting.

500
00:38:59,327 --> 00:39:04,276
And, uh, maybe I sh-- Yeah,
and I should stop-- stop painting
and just be a nice person foryou.

501
00:39:04,367 --> 00:39:06,562
Now, is-- is that what
you want me to do? Huh?

502
00:39:06,647 --> 00:39:11,163
I don´t give a damn what you do.
My brother´s a United States Marine,
and I can´t take this any more!

503
00:39:11,247 --> 00:39:13,477
Get out of here.
Get outta here!

504
00:39:13,567 --> 00:39:15,922
I can´t take this any more!

505
00:39:16,007 --> 00:39:18,202
Get out of my room!

506
00:39:18,287 --> 00:39:20,562
Your room?
I own the damn building!

507
00:39:20,647 --> 00:39:24,196
A complete unknown

508
00:39:24,287 --> 00:39:26,926
Just like a rollingstone

509
00:39:32,567 --> 00:39:35,206
You´vegone to the finestschool
Allright, MissLonely

510
00:39:35,287 --> 00:39:39,041
- Butyou knowyou only
usedtogetjuicedin it
- You know something?

511
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:45,478
Ifjust once you came by my room
and said, "Gee, Paulette,
you´re a terrible painter.

512
00:39:45,567 --> 00:39:48,718
- Why don´t you get a job and enjoy it?´´
- Let me tell you something.

513
00:39:48,807 --> 00:39:51,367
You think I just use people,
just grind ´em up.

514
00:39:51,447 --> 00:39:53,358
Well, you don´t know
anything about me.

515
00:39:53,447 --> 00:39:56,120
You don´t know how involved I get
or how far down I go.

516
00:39:56,207 --> 00:39:58,846
Hell, I was married four times since
before you were even born.

517
00:39:58,927 --> 00:40:03,603
- So don´t you tell me!
- He´snotsellin´anyalibis

518
00:40:03,687 --> 00:40:07,885
Asyoustare into the vacuum
ofhis eyes

519
00:40:07,967 --> 00:40:11,676
-Andsays toyou wouldyou like to
- So don´t tell me.

520
00:40:11,767 --> 00:40:14,918
Make a deal

521
00:40:15,967 --> 00:40:17,878
Howdoes it feel

522
00:40:20,607 --> 00:40:22,837
Howdoes it feel

523
00:40:24,287 --> 00:40:27,643
- To be without a home
- Chippies.

524
00:40:27,727 --> 00:40:31,083
You know why they call ´em that? Because
they like to chip away at you, man.

525
00:40:31,167 --> 00:40:35,001
Take a little chip. That´s your
art form. That´s your talent.

526
00:40:37,407 --> 00:40:39,762
Just like a rollingstone

527
00:40:40,847 --> 00:40:42,758
Oh, God.

528
00:41:01,527 --> 00:41:05,236
Excuse me, Mr Dobie, uh,
I-I just wanna tell ya, man, like,
I´m kinda like an artist myself.

529
00:41:05,327 --> 00:41:08,399
When I look at your stuff,
I just wanna divorce my wife.

530
00:41:08,487 --> 00:41:10,921
- I mean, like, thankyou.
- Thankyou.
- Thankyou.

531
00:41:21,247 --> 00:41:23,556
- Can I have a white wine, please?
- Sure.

532
00:41:25,407 --> 00:41:27,523
- There you go.
- Thankyou.

533
00:41:42,847 --> 00:41:47,637
- What was that?
- I wanted to touch you for good luck.

534
00:41:47,727 --> 00:41:50,844
- For me?
- No, for me.

535
00:41:50,927 --> 00:41:53,122
Maybe some of it´ll rub off, um--

536
00:41:55,127 --> 00:41:57,118
Are you an artist?

537
00:41:57,207 --> 00:42:00,677
You´re an artist.
I´m a painter.

538
00:42:00,767 --> 00:42:02,758
I mean, I´m trying to--

539
00:42:02,847 --> 00:42:06,396
- I´m not saying this right.
- Listen, are you making ends meet?

540
00:42:06,487 --> 00:42:08,637
Um, it´s an expensive city.

541
00:42:08,727 --> 00:42:11,605
Oh, it´s the only city.

542
00:42:11,687 --> 00:42:13,359
What´s Fowler pay you?
Peanuts, right?

543
00:42:15,247 --> 00:42:17,158
Yeah.

544
00:42:36,607 --> 00:42:41,476
I need an assistant.
I pay room and board, give life lessons
that are priceless, plus a salary.

545
00:42:41,567 --> 00:42:43,558
You wouldn´t know anybody
who needs a job, would ya?

546
00:42:43,647 --> 00:42:45,763
Oh, God!

547
00:42:45,847 --> 00:42:48,566
- What´s your name? I´m Lionel Dobie.
- Hi.

548
00:43:15,287 --> 00:43:19,360
We skippedthe light fandango

549
00:43:49,647 --> 00:43:55,165
Did you know that flute playing
was once banned by law?

550
00:43:55,247 --> 00:43:57,442
Once upon a time it was.

551
00:44:00,207 --> 00:44:03,517
It was banned because
it was so beautiful...

552
00:44:03,607 --> 00:44:07,566
that all the virgins fell in love
and got themselves seduced.

553
00:44:12,327 --> 00:44:16,115
My father told me that story.
He´s Claudio Montez...

554
00:44:16,207 --> 00:44:19,005
and he´s the greatest
flute player in the world.

555
00:44:22,207 --> 00:44:24,118
My mother is
Charlotte Montez...

556
00:44:24,207 --> 00:44:26,801
and she´s usually travelling
in India or somewhere...

557
00:44:26,887 --> 00:44:30,675
taking photographs
or maybe writing a book.

558
00:44:30,767 --> 00:44:33,839
Her beautiful face
was the fiirst sight I ever saw.

559
00:44:35,767 --> 00:44:38,679
When I was born, Claudio used
to play the baby music for me...

560
00:44:38,767 --> 00:44:40,678
on his silver flute.

561
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:45,723
It was the fiirst sound
I ever heard.

562
00:44:45,807 --> 00:44:50,278
They named me Zoe,
because Zoe means "life´´ in Greek.

563
00:44:58,127 --> 00:45:01,597
Zoe, considerher

564
00:45:01,687 --> 00:45:04,804
Zoe, deliverher

565
00:45:04,887 --> 00:45:08,277
She´sso offbeat

566
00:45:08,367 --> 00:45:12,326
So bittersweet

567
00:45:12,407 --> 00:45:15,956
Zoe, considerher

568
00:45:16,047 --> 00:45:19,323
Zoe, deliverher

569
00:45:19,407 --> 00:45:23,082
Life wouldbe nothing without her

570
00:45:23,167 --> 00:45:25,920
She´sgot thatsomethingabout her

571
00:45:26,007 --> 00:45:28,567
Makesme weak

572
00:45:34,087 --> 00:45:35,884
Zoe, considerher

573
00:45:35,967 --> 00:45:38,322
Since Claudio and
Charlotte are rarely home...

574
00:45:38,407 --> 00:45:40,637
I live alone in
the Sherry Netherlands Hotel...

575
00:45:40,727 --> 00:45:43,400
where the old ladies in the elevator
wear too much perfume.

576
00:45:46,687 --> 00:45:50,362
Hector is our family butler
and my guardian angel.

577
00:45:50,447 --> 00:45:53,007
He takes care of me
when my parents are travelling...

578
00:45:53,087 --> 00:45:55,203
which is most ofthe time.

579
00:46:00,287 --> 00:46:02,323
- I´m not in.
- Good morning, Miss Montez!

580
00:46:04,127 --> 00:46:06,800
Come on. Get up. You don´t
wanna be late for school again.

581
00:46:06,887 --> 00:46:08,843
- Hi, Vegas.
- Smell that hot chocolate.

582
00:46:08,927 --> 00:46:12,158
Come on. It´sjust like you like it--
sugar and Sweet´N Low.

583
00:46:12,247 --> 00:46:15,922
- One and one.
- Yeah. Don´t wanna go to school.

584
00:46:16,007 --> 00:46:18,441
- I don´t feel good.
- You don´t what?

585
00:46:18,527 --> 00:46:21,405
You know, maybe you have the flu.
It´s going around.

586
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:24,797
Let me-- Ooh!
I burned my hand!

587
00:46:24,887 --> 00:46:28,926
Quick, get the salve.
Ooh, please help! Please!

588
00:46:29,007 --> 00:46:31,601
Tell you what.
We´ll look at your horoscope, okay?

589
00:46:31,687 --> 00:46:34,485
See what that says
about going to school.

590
00:46:34,567 --> 00:46:36,797
"Miss Zoe Montez, Aries.

591
00:46:36,887 --> 00:46:38,798
Have a nice
continental breakfast...

592
00:46:38,887 --> 00:46:42,243
then get up real quick
and get dressed for school.

593
00:46:42,327 --> 00:46:44,682
Don´t dilly-dally.´´

594
00:46:44,767 --> 00:46:47,201
What´s that mean, "dilly-dally´´?

595
00:46:47,287 --> 00:46:49,403
It means you made it up.

596
00:46:50,847 --> 00:46:54,556
How ´bout you wear this today?
This is nice.

597
00:46:54,647 --> 00:46:58,959
My father gets the most unusual mail.
Brooklyn Academy of Music--

598
00:46:59,047 --> 00:47:01,436
- Yes or no? Wanna wear this?
- No.

599
00:47:01,527 --> 00:47:04,758
- No?
-Julio Iglesias tickets?

600
00:47:06,807 --> 00:47:09,526
How ´bout this?
You could put this on real quick.

601
00:47:09,607 --> 00:47:11,518
- Mm, okay.
- Okay.

602
00:47:13,887 --> 00:47:15,718
You know, maybe you should
open the rest ofthe mail...

603
00:47:15,807 --> 00:47:17,843
when you get home
from school tonight.

604
00:47:17,927 --> 00:47:20,282
You´ll have more time then.

605
00:47:20,367 --> 00:47:23,723
Hmm, the minister ofSharez
is having a big bash.

606
00:47:23,807 --> 00:47:26,480
- Sharez. Do you know where is?
- Mm, no.

607
00:47:26,567 --> 00:47:30,003
We could look it up in the atlas
tonight. But now you can´t be late.

608
00:47:30,087 --> 00:47:33,966
- You know what your mother said.
- Oh, my mother.
Her life is always such a mess.

609
00:47:34,047 --> 00:47:37,926
And before you know it, she tries
to organize mine long-distance.

610
00:47:38,007 --> 00:47:40,316
- Listen, you´re gonna miss
the bus again. You know what time--
- It´s not right.

611
00:47:40,407 --> 00:47:43,080
- Look, it´s 8:06, 8:07.
- It´sjust not fair.

612
00:47:43,167 --> 00:47:45,965
- Right in that area. Hurry.
- Hot to trot.

613
00:47:46,047 --> 00:47:50,245
Hey, you see? Your favourite.
Look, farm fresh.

614
00:47:50,327 --> 00:47:52,477
And it´s donejust
like you like it.

615
00:47:52,567 --> 00:47:54,478
Seven-and-a-half minutes.

616
00:47:54,567 --> 00:47:57,320
I put a little salt on it,
no pepper.

617
00:47:57,407 --> 00:47:59,967
Okay, now, chew it 20 times
like I showed you.

618
00:48:01,447 --> 00:48:03,802
One-- Oh. Okay, just yolk?

619
00:48:03,887 --> 00:48:05,798
I´ll give you some
ofthe white stuff later.

620
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:09,641
Remember her trying to teach me about my
credit cards and my damn bank balance?

621
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:12,446
Watch your language.
Don´t say "bank balance.´´

622
00:48:12,527 --> 00:48:14,995
Once I was in debt,
I was in debt so much...

623
00:48:15,087 --> 00:48:17,157
that with all the deductions
she took out of my allowance...

624
00:48:17,247 --> 00:48:19,761
I didn´t even have enough
money to pay for taxis.

625
00:48:21,967 --> 00:48:25,482
Thanks, Hector.Just don´t let
my mom long-distance harass you.

626
00:48:25,567 --> 00:48:27,717
Whatever´s right.
Whatever´s right.

627
00:48:27,807 --> 00:48:30,685
- Oh, good. Thanks, Vegas.
- The bus is leaving. It does not wait.

628
00:48:30,767 --> 00:48:34,396
- It´ll wait!
- Don´t miss the B-U-S!
- Don´t worry. Calm down.

629
00:48:34,487 --> 00:48:36,398
Go, Zoe, go!

630
00:48:40,887 --> 00:48:42,798
Hustle, Zoe.

631
00:48:44,327 --> 00:48:46,238
Good morning, Mr Lilly.
What´s new?

632
00:48:46,327 --> 00:48:49,285
I suppose you want cash, Zoe.

633
00:48:49,367 --> 00:48:51,483
I wasjust saying hello.

634
00:48:51,567 --> 00:48:54,798
Please, a twenty, two tens,
a fiive and fiive singles.

635
00:48:54,887 --> 00:48:58,675
Charge it to my account, please.
Just in case I miss my bus.

636
00:49:02,967 --> 00:49:05,435
And they´re off! Oh!

637
00:49:05,527 --> 00:49:08,883
Here comes Zoe, running tired.
Running tired.

638
00:49:08,967 --> 00:49:12,562
Zoe´s gonna be late for school again.
She´s gonna be late, folks.

639
00:49:12,647 --> 00:49:14,922
She´s running slow.
She´s running tired.

640
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:18,716
She´s not gonna make it!
Come on, Zoe. Run. Run, Zoe!

641
00:49:22,047 --> 00:49:23,958
Shit!

642
00:49:30,607 --> 00:49:33,121
Cab, cab, cab, cab!
Taxi!

643
00:49:43,087 --> 00:49:47,877
- You know, I have yet
to see you be on time.
- Thanks foryour concern.

644
00:49:47,967 --> 00:49:50,606
- Who is that?
- Oh, that´s the new kid.
- Oh, that´s the new boy.

645
00:49:50,687 --> 00:49:53,565
- New boy?
- Oh, my Lord, look!
- That´s a very, very nice suit.

646
00:49:53,647 --> 00:49:55,797
Look at that thing
on that guy´s head.

647
00:49:55,887 --> 00:49:58,321
It´s a turban.
Haven´t you ever seen one before?

648
00:49:58,407 --> 00:50:00,079
Let´s get an interview
with that new boy!

649
00:50:00,167 --> 00:50:04,206
Yeah! Andrea Melcher says he´s one
ofthe richest boys in the world.

650
00:50:04,287 --> 00:50:07,085
- Oh, my God.
- Andrea said that?
- She knows him already?

651
00:50:07,167 --> 00:50:11,558
- She works fast.
- The richest boy.

652
00:50:11,647 --> 00:50:14,684
- Excuse me.
- Zoe, how are we gonna get
an interview with him?

653
00:50:14,767 --> 00:50:16,883
- He has bodyguards.
- Yeah.
- Big bodyguards.

654
00:50:16,967 --> 00:50:18,878
Rich people like
to be in the press.

655
00:50:18,967 --> 00:50:21,117
Yeah, but what are you
gonna say to him?

656
00:50:21,207 --> 00:50:23,767
We have champagne
and caviar, baby.

657
00:50:23,847 --> 00:50:27,601
I show you my new BMW
and my red Ferarri.

658
00:50:27,687 --> 00:50:29,917
We make beautiful music together.

659
00:50:30,007 --> 00:50:33,795
He´s got a silver Maserati
with a 24-hour-a-day driver.

660
00:50:33,887 --> 00:50:38,199
- Can you believe that?
- My Maseratigoes 185

661
00:50:38,287 --> 00:50:41,199
Girls. Girls, girls.
Now, we need to get back to work.

662
00:50:41,287 --> 00:50:43,084
- Sorry, Mrs Mendez.
- We have a magazine to put out.

663
00:50:43,167 --> 00:50:44,919
- Who has his number?
How can we get his number?
- Andrea.

664
00:50:45,007 --> 00:50:49,558
- Andrea´sjust like--
- Andrea!

665
00:50:49,647 --> 00:50:52,161
- Are you talking to me?
- Can we have Abu´s phone number?

666
00:50:52,247 --> 00:50:54,841
He´ll be on the cover
of Dingbat News.

667
00:50:56,367 --> 00:50:59,359
I enjoy taking long walks.

668
00:50:59,447 --> 00:51:01,961
He enjoys long walks.

669
00:51:02,047 --> 00:51:04,686
I get really bored
with spending money.

670
00:51:06,527 --> 00:51:08,757
Bored spending money.

671
00:51:08,847 --> 00:51:11,042
I intend to inherit
my father´s wealth...

672
00:51:11,127 --> 00:51:13,925
and after that,
create many times more...

673
00:51:14,007 --> 00:51:16,237
so that I will be
the richest man in the world...

674
00:51:16,327 --> 00:51:18,124
by the time I am 24.

675
00:51:18,207 --> 00:51:22,359
Lately, people have been offering
me drugs, but I am not interested.

676
00:51:22,447 --> 00:51:26,201
- I can satisfy myself
with a chocolate bar.
- Really?

677
00:51:26,287 --> 00:51:29,120
I like going to parties.
Sometimes the Hewitt girls...

678
00:51:29,207 --> 00:51:33,678
- invite me to their parties...
- Thankyou.
- at the Carlyle or the Concorde.

679
00:51:33,767 --> 00:51:37,237
Last year, I was a straight guy.
I was very preppy--

680
00:51:37,327 --> 00:51:41,206
into computers, video games
and a dirt bike.

681
00:51:41,287 --> 00:51:45,485
- Now, I am into clothes
and music and art.
- Wow.

682
00:51:45,567 --> 00:51:48,240
This is the Dingbat News,
not People magazine.

683
00:51:48,327 --> 00:51:51,922
Well, we are supposed to
wear socks, but I do not.

684
00:51:52,007 --> 00:51:54,646
Oh, good.
Doesn´t wear socks.

685
00:51:54,727 --> 00:51:59,517
I have talked to Morgan Fairchild on
the telephone for an hour in my room.

686
00:52:02,247 --> 00:52:06,286
Oh, I suppose you see right through me,
popular girls like you.

687
00:52:06,367 --> 00:52:09,723
- See through you?
- Yes. Right through me, I think.

688
00:52:09,807 --> 00:52:13,038
- Why?
- I have no friends, hardly.

689
00:52:13,127 --> 00:52:15,163
Not any kids of my own age.

690
00:52:15,247 --> 00:52:17,522
But I have plenty
ofadult friends...

691
00:52:17,607 --> 00:52:20,041
but they´re easy to get
when you´re rich.

692
00:52:20,127 --> 00:52:22,846
- No friends at all?
- Not one.

693
00:52:22,927 --> 00:52:26,636
- Really?
- Gee, that´s too bad.
- Abu, I was a very lonely kid.

694
00:52:26,727 --> 00:52:30,242
I used to travel with my father,
so I had no friends.

695
00:52:30,327 --> 00:52:33,364
You? No friends? Really?

696
00:52:33,447 --> 00:52:35,517
Then my mom told me the story
ofthe bunny rabbit.

697
00:52:37,207 --> 00:52:41,325
"Bunny rabbit´´?
What is bunny rabbit?

698
00:52:41,407 --> 00:52:45,525
Once upon a time there was
a bunny rabbit, a lonely one.

699
00:52:45,607 --> 00:52:47,757
He had no friends at all.

700
00:52:47,847 --> 00:52:51,476
So his mother put him in his backyard
with all his toys and carrots...

701
00:52:51,567 --> 00:52:55,037
and vegetables and said,
"You play here with all your stuff.´´

702
00:52:55,127 --> 00:52:57,322
- And what do you think happened?
- What happened?

703
00:52:57,407 --> 00:53:00,843
Soon, lots of bunny rabbits were
peeking over the fence, saying...

704
00:53:00,927 --> 00:53:03,043
"Can I play too?´´

705
00:53:03,127 --> 00:53:06,005
My mom told me that story.

706
00:53:06,087 --> 00:53:08,282
Whenever I´m lonely
and have no friends...

707
00:53:08,367 --> 00:53:10,642
I just have a lot
offun by myself.

708
00:53:10,727 --> 00:53:14,845
And people always peek over the fence
and say, "Can we play too?´´

709
00:53:14,927 --> 00:53:18,522
I see. So be it.

710
00:53:18,607 --> 00:53:20,916
Can I play too?

711
00:53:21,007 --> 00:53:22,759
- Let´s go shopping.
- Okay.

712
00:53:29,727 --> 00:53:31,877
Thankyou, Abu.
I had a wonderful time.

713
00:53:31,967 --> 00:53:36,040
- So have I.
- But it´s extremely late.

714
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:39,164
- Will you be in trouble?
- I don´t think so. Bye-bye!

715
00:53:39,247 --> 00:53:41,681
I´m sorry.
We don´t have a "Carter´´ on here.

716
00:53:41,767 --> 00:53:44,759
Right here. Come on. Pull it.

717
00:53:44,847 --> 00:53:47,600
- Come on. Move! Hey!
- Hey, I´m cool, buddy.
I´m not a real security guard.

718
00:53:47,687 --> 00:53:50,997
- I´m just an out-of-work actor
tryin´ to pay the rent.
- Quiet! Quiet, fat man.

719
00:53:51,087 --> 00:53:54,477
- We do this all the time.
- Leave me alone!Jimmy, please!
- Now you got something to
tell your grandchildren.

720
00:53:54,567 --> 00:53:57,035
-Don´t hurt her!
-Lie down there. On your hands! Come on!

721
00:53:57,127 --> 00:53:59,038
It´s all right. Come on.
Do what they say. It´s a robbery.

722
00:53:59,127 --> 00:54:02,517
- Quiet! And don´t look!
- I´m scared.
- Be still and don´t look at them.

723
00:54:02,607 --> 00:54:04,996
Stay here and don´t look.
Don´t look!

724
00:54:08,607 --> 00:54:11,963
- Keep your eyes down.
- I don´t want to.
- Shut up, kid!

725
00:54:12,047 --> 00:54:14,880
- Comfy?
- Leave her alone.
Kick me. Don´t kick her.

726
00:54:16,607 --> 00:54:19,121
What do you have there?

727
00:54:21,247 --> 00:54:24,762
- Pop it, pop it. Come on!
- Hey, that´s my father´s. Number 77!

728
00:54:24,847 --> 00:54:28,601
- Clam up, kid, or I´ll make ya howl!
- They´ve got his security box!

729
00:54:28,687 --> 00:54:30,803
I was gonna inherit
his cuff links someday.

730
00:54:30,887 --> 00:54:34,436
- Will you keep quiet?
- Zoe, this is serious. Look at my eye.

731
00:54:34,527 --> 00:54:36,404
- I´ve got an audition tomorrow.
-Just the big stuff.

732
00:54:36,487 --> 00:54:40,036
- Blot that out with a little
Chanel Soft Bisque number three.
- Really?

733
00:54:40,127 --> 00:54:42,402
- Hey, how you kids doin´ there, huh?
You need anything?
- All right.

734
00:54:42,487 --> 00:54:44,478
- You comfy?
- Yeah.
- No.
- You want anything? A blanket?

735
00:54:44,567 --> 00:54:47,639
Uh, how about a lobster roll,
or, uh, maybe a club sandwich?

736
00:54:47,727 --> 00:54:51,322
How would you like that?
Ask me. Anything you want.
You just ask me. I´m your man, okay?

737
00:54:51,407 --> 00:54:54,046
Come on, fellas. Let´s go!
Move it! Come on! Let´s go.

738
00:55:01,847 --> 00:55:04,725
Don´t make any fuss for a while.
We might be right back.

739
00:55:05,887 --> 00:55:08,640
Good foryou.
Big deal.

740
00:55:08,727 --> 00:55:12,322
Boy, Zoe, if I could remember
this sense memory, I´d be
the hit of my acting class.

741
00:55:12,407 --> 00:55:14,875
- Bravo,Jimmy.
- Thankyou, Mr Lilly.

742
00:55:14,967 --> 00:55:16,923
- Are you all right, Zoe?
- Yeah.

743
00:55:17,007 --> 00:55:18,918
You were very brave.

744
00:55:27,287 --> 00:55:30,916
Lately, all these high-class New York
hotels have been getting robbed.

745
00:55:31,007 --> 00:55:33,237
I´m glad the crook dropped the package
he stole from my father´s...

746
00:55:33,327 --> 00:55:36,046
safe deposit box,
and I got it back.

747
00:55:42,367 --> 00:55:46,679
Wow. Those crooks sure
didn´t know what they had.

748
00:55:49,207 --> 00:55:51,596
I´d better tell Hector.

749
00:55:54,087 --> 00:55:57,238
Hector!
Hector, wake up! Hector!

750
00:55:57,327 --> 00:55:59,682
- What?
- There was a robbery downstairs!

751
00:55:59,767 --> 00:56:01,439
- What?
- Yeah.

752
00:56:01,527 --> 00:56:05,520
- Are you all right?
- Yes. Here, look.

753
00:56:05,607 --> 00:56:08,121
Theyjust took it out of
my father´s safety deposit box.

754
00:56:08,207 --> 00:56:11,244
Look, it´s a diamond,
and there´s a note.

755
00:56:11,327 --> 00:56:16,526
"A Tear ofSharez for my tears when
I heard your flute. Princess Soroya.´´

756
00:56:16,607 --> 00:56:21,397
- Sharez? Where´s that invitation
we opened this morning?
- In the garbage.

757
00:56:21,487 --> 00:56:24,445
- What?
- Threw it in the garbage.
- Oh, gosh.

758
00:56:24,527 --> 00:56:26,995
Come on.
Come on, Hector.

759
00:56:27,087 --> 00:56:29,601
- How´d you get that thing?
- Those crooks dropped it.

760
00:56:29,687 --> 00:56:32,485
- Vegas, drop-- Ahh!
- Ahh!
- Open your mouth.

761
00:56:32,567 --> 00:56:33,920
- Drop it!
- Zoe, just--
- I am!

762
00:56:34,007 --> 00:56:37,204
- Pull it, pull it, pull it.
- Wait! Got it!
- Got it? Okay.

763
00:56:37,287 --> 00:56:39,198
I hope we have all the pieces.
I don´t know.

764
00:56:39,287 --> 00:56:41,517
- Yeah.
- You think so?
- Yeah.

765
00:56:41,607 --> 00:56:43,757
Yeah, we-we got it all.
It´s all here.

766
00:56:43,847 --> 00:56:47,044
- "Sheik Omar requests--´´
- "Sheek´´ Omar.

767
00:56:47,127 --> 00:56:49,482
- It´s pronounced "shake´´.
- "Sheek´´ Omar.

768
00:56:49,567 --> 00:56:53,003
Okay. "Sheik Omar requests the pleasure
ofthe company of Mr Claudio Montez...

769
00:56:53,087 --> 00:56:55,442
at dinner and a party to follow.

770
00:56:55,527 --> 00:57:00,521
Princess Soroya will wear
the famed Tears ofSharez earrings.

771
00:57:00,607 --> 00:57:02,359
Black tie.´´

772
00:57:02,447 --> 00:57:04,483
Well, black tie´s no problem,
but the earrings--

773
00:57:04,567 --> 00:57:07,035
one earring, anyway,
is gonna be a problem.

774
00:57:07,127 --> 00:57:10,642
- How can she wear it if it´s here?
- I know.

775
00:57:10,727 --> 00:57:14,163
Claudio´s in big trouble,
and it´s not his fault.

776
00:57:14,247 --> 00:57:18,638
I know what happened. She probably
heard him play the flute, and then she
took it off her ear and gave it to him.

777
00:57:18,727 --> 00:57:21,241
- It happens all the time.
- And the sheik must think...

778
00:57:21,327 --> 00:57:23,363
that he´s falling
in love with his wife.

779
00:57:23,447 --> 00:57:26,564
- Oh, no.
- We gotta fiind this Princess Soroya.

780
00:57:26,647 --> 00:57:28,319
Give her back the diamond.
That´s all.

781
00:57:28,407 --> 00:57:30,762
Sheik Omar.
Maybe Abu´s heard of him.

782
00:57:30,847 --> 00:57:33,156
Abu? Who´s Abu? Abu who?

783
00:57:33,247 --> 00:57:35,158
Abu´s my new friend.

784
00:57:39,247 --> 00:57:41,636
Hi, Abu? It´s Zoe.

785
00:57:41,727 --> 00:57:43,797
Fine. And you?

786
00:57:43,887 --> 00:57:46,321
I hope it´s not too late.

787
00:57:46,407 --> 00:57:49,080
Say, Abu, do you know Sheik Omar?

788
00:57:50,887 --> 00:57:52,320
"Shake´´ Omar.

789
00:57:56,327 --> 00:57:58,397
Oh, he´s your uncle.

790
00:58:00,407 --> 00:58:02,523
Oh, he´s the king!

791
00:58:04,487 --> 00:58:06,762
So Princess Soroya is your aunt.

792
00:58:09,967 --> 00:58:13,801
Abu? How would you
like to have a party?

793
00:58:13,887 --> 00:58:16,196
- Play with all your
carrots and vegetables.
- Vegetables?

794
00:58:16,287 --> 00:58:19,245
- Sorry, Hector.
- Hit me in the head with the hat. Abu?

795
00:58:19,327 --> 00:58:22,683
- Yeah, like the bunny rabbit.
- Rabbits? What´s goin´ on?

796
00:58:22,767 --> 00:58:28,399
Oh! Your parents are
out oftown. Perfect!

797
00:58:29,846 --> 00:58:33,156
Yoo-hoo! Yoo-hoo!

798
00:58:33,246 --> 00:58:36,204
It´s Tom Cruise,
and I´m wearing a tank top.

799
00:58:36,286 --> 00:58:40,518
- Howdy,Jimmy. How´s tricks?
- Eh. Hey, Zoe, you think next time your
mom hasJoe Papp over for dinner...

800
00:58:40,606 --> 00:58:42,676
she could use these for place mats?

801
00:58:42,766 --> 00:58:45,883
- I think the plates might break.
- Ohh.

802
00:58:45,966 --> 00:58:49,038
- Say,Jimmy, I like you in that colour.
- Thanks,Jimmy.
- Something about a man in uniform.

803
00:58:49,126 --> 00:58:51,879
Oh, and, ladies, these pinky drinkies
are on Raoul.

804
00:58:51,966 --> 00:58:54,560
- All right.
- Strawberry daiquiris.
- Who´s coming to Abu´s party?

805
00:58:54,646 --> 00:58:57,160
Hey, the butler did it.

806
00:58:57,246 --> 00:58:59,840
Zoe, I gotta talk to you for a minute.

807
00:58:59,926 --> 00:59:02,679
- Zoe, your mother called and said--
- Yeah, I know.

808
00:59:02,766 --> 00:59:08,398
My mother called to tell me that
she´s working on a new photojournal
of India, and my mother is home.

809
00:59:08,486 --> 00:59:11,717
- My mother is home.
- Hello, Zoe darling.

810
00:59:11,806 --> 00:59:15,685
So, is this what your father
calls "sophisticated´´?

811
00:59:15,766 --> 00:59:19,679
Twelve-year-old girls drinking
strawberry daiquiris and reading
Paris Vogue.

812
00:59:19,766 --> 00:59:22,234
- Mom, what are you doing here?
- Oh, my God, we gotta go.

813
00:59:22,326 --> 00:59:24,044
That´s a warm welcome,
and I´m your mother...

814
00:59:24,126 --> 00:59:28,642
this is my bedroom,
and these are my earrings.

815
00:59:28,726 --> 00:59:30,364
- I´m sorry, Mrs Montez.
- Sorry.

816
00:59:30,446 --> 00:59:31,879
- Bye, Zoe.
- That´s my hat.

817
00:59:31,966 --> 00:59:34,275
- Watch that.
- Sorry.
- Bye, Mrs Montez.

818
00:59:34,366 --> 00:59:38,962
- I´m sorry, girls. I was not
intending to be a snob. It was--
- So long, Zoe.

819
00:59:39,046 --> 00:59:41,321
- You will forgive me, won´t you, girls?
- Bye, Zoe.
- Bye, Mrs Montez.

820
00:59:41,406 --> 00:59:43,795
- Bye, girls.
- Move it, move it. Let´s go. Move it.

821
00:59:47,206 --> 00:59:48,321
- Hello.
- Aw.

822
00:59:48,406 --> 00:59:49,919
One, two, three--

823
00:59:51,326 --> 00:59:53,601
Come on, Lundy.
Hurry up. Let´s go.

824
00:59:53,686 --> 00:59:55,358
- Bye, Zoe.
- See you later, Bridget.

825
00:59:55,446 --> 00:59:58,882
Uh, sorry, Mom,
but what´s going on?

826
00:59:58,966 --> 01:00:01,878
Zoe, I know this is--
this is diffiicult, but...

827
01:00:01,966 --> 01:00:04,799
your father and I
are trying a reconciliation.

828
01:00:05,806 --> 01:00:07,717
What?

829
01:00:09,046 --> 01:00:12,197
Oh, Zoe. Oh, sweetheart.

830
01:00:12,286 --> 01:00:14,641
Most kids would be happy
to hear that.

831
01:00:15,566 --> 01:00:17,955
Oh, whatever´s right.

832
01:00:19,166 --> 01:00:21,521
- It´s your clothes, I think.
- My clothes?

833
01:00:21,606 --> 01:00:23,642
Something´s wrong with my clothes?

834
01:00:23,726 --> 01:00:26,684
The shoulders are really big.

835
01:00:26,766 --> 01:00:30,315
Oh, Zoe, would yo--
Please don´t start on my shoulders.

836
01:00:30,406 --> 01:00:33,478
A woman shouldn´t have
bigger shoulders than a man.

837
01:00:33,566 --> 01:00:37,354
Besides, they slide around.

838
01:00:39,926 --> 01:00:42,360
Face it, Mom, they´re passé.

839
01:00:44,046 --> 01:00:46,082
We should have given me
a fair warning you were coming...

840
01:00:46,166 --> 01:00:48,839
so I could have reserved
a room at the Plaza.

841
01:00:48,926 --> 01:00:50,917
She´s a nut.

842
01:00:51,006 --> 01:00:53,440
See? And you´re smoking again.

843
01:00:53,526 --> 01:00:56,916
I tell you, Charlotte,
you shouldn´t be hanging out
with those art friends ofyours.

844
01:00:57,006 --> 01:01:01,318
Lucy Montana and Aggie Zenobia?
You´re better than that, Mom.

845
01:01:01,406 --> 01:01:04,796
You have real talent, and you´d see it
ifyou´d quit competing with Claudio.

846
01:01:06,726 --> 01:01:10,082
I´m the daughter,
and you´re the mother! Oh.

847
01:01:10,166 --> 01:01:12,600
I´m the mother,
and you´re the daughter.

848
01:01:12,686 --> 01:01:14,961
Right.

849
01:01:39,446 --> 01:01:41,118
Daddy, oh, Daddy!

850
01:01:41,206 --> 01:01:44,243
- I was worried about you.
- How´s my principessa?

851
01:01:46,766 --> 01:01:49,519
I love your scarf.
Can I wear it?

852
01:01:49,606 --> 01:01:51,085
Ofcourse.

853
01:01:51,166 --> 01:01:53,157
Can I have it?
Just kidding.

854
01:01:55,126 --> 01:01:57,117
Look. You can use it
for a poster.

855
01:01:58,366 --> 01:02:00,436
Ah. Wonderful. Good idea.

856
01:02:00,526 --> 01:02:03,438
It´s a-- It´s a work ofart.

857
01:02:03,526 --> 01:02:06,757
Look. I could use it
for an album cover.

858
01:02:06,846 --> 01:02:11,283
- What do you think?
- Yeah. Sit down. Relax.
You must be tired.

859
01:02:11,366 --> 01:02:13,561
- Can I get you a drink?
- Ah, sure.

860
01:02:17,806 --> 01:02:19,797
Hey, Vegas.
How are you, Vegas?

861
01:02:22,846 --> 01:02:24,359
Thankyou.

862
01:02:25,606 --> 01:02:27,915
- My bambina.
- How´s everything?

863
01:02:30,206 --> 01:02:31,355
Well...

864
01:02:32,526 --> 01:02:35,484
in life there are always
a few problems.

865
01:02:35,566 --> 01:02:38,399
But, uh, things are not too bad.

866
01:02:38,486 --> 01:02:40,477
We were all surprised
you interrupted your tour.

867
01:02:41,806 --> 01:02:44,718
- Well, you know how it is.
- How is it?

868
01:02:47,006 --> 01:02:50,965
Uh, I´m a little bit in hot water.

869
01:02:52,486 --> 01:02:55,398
- You know what that means?
- I can fiigure it out.

870
01:02:56,726 --> 01:02:59,365
But nothing foryou
to worry about, my little signorina.

871
01:03:03,886 --> 01:03:05,797
That´s for me, Vegas.

872
01:03:06,806 --> 01:03:08,444
Hello?

873
01:03:08,526 --> 01:03:10,357
Yes.

874
01:03:12,526 --> 01:03:14,357
Still?

875
01:03:16,926 --> 01:03:20,839
- What is it?
- Oh, my little charmer.

876
01:03:20,926 --> 01:03:22,917
Did you know Mom
was coming home too?

877
01:03:24,406 --> 01:03:26,317
Yes, your mother.

878
01:03:27,686 --> 01:03:31,759
Zoe, did I ever tell you how once
playing the flute was banned by law?

879
01:03:31,846 --> 01:03:33,438
A million times.

880
01:03:34,806 --> 01:03:37,878
It was banned because the sound
was so beautiful...

881
01:03:37,966 --> 01:03:40,355
so seductive.

882
01:03:40,446 --> 01:03:43,119
- It oughta be against the law.
- It´s true.

883
01:03:45,526 --> 01:03:47,482
Since when did you
start smoking again?

884
01:03:47,566 --> 01:03:49,761
Mm. Occasional cigarette.

885
01:03:49,846 --> 01:03:53,441
A flautist shouldn´t smoke.
I can help, Pops.

886
01:04:00,086 --> 01:04:02,680
Believe me, Zoe,
there is no problem, though.

887
01:04:04,166 --> 01:04:06,077
It wasjust a--

888
01:04:06,166 --> 01:04:08,726
- Well, you see--
- Yes?

889
01:04:11,686 --> 01:04:14,484
A very beautiful, mysterious woman.

890
01:04:14,566 --> 01:04:17,524
- A princess, in fact.
- She heard you play the flute.

891
01:04:19,006 --> 01:04:22,919
And she was so moved
that she gave me a jewel--

892
01:04:23,006 --> 01:04:25,156
an earring.

893
01:04:25,246 --> 01:04:27,806
She plucked from her ear and said...

894
01:04:28,886 --> 01:04:32,720
"A Tear ofSharez
for my tears...

895
01:04:32,806 --> 01:04:35,195
when I heard your flute.´´

896
01:04:35,286 --> 01:04:37,561
I put it in my pocket.

897
01:04:37,646 --> 01:04:41,434
- It´s nice, isn´t it?
- But-- But--

898
01:04:41,526 --> 01:04:44,199
How? I thought it was stolen.

899
01:04:47,046 --> 01:04:49,276
Her husband isj--

900
01:04:49,366 --> 01:04:53,200
You see, Zoe, he doesn´t know it was
all an innocent misunderstanding.

901
01:04:53,286 --> 01:04:55,402
- Neither will Mom.
- Exactly.

902
01:04:55,486 --> 01:04:58,523
And this is the wrong time
for something to go wrong.

903
01:04:58,606 --> 01:05:01,837
-Just give it back.
- He has a man watching me.

904
01:05:03,686 --> 01:05:06,564
Maybe I can help, Pops.
