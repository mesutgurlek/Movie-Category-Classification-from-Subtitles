1
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,840
Somebody's coming, Pa.

2
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,160
Well... Let him come.

3
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:59,320
Hope you don't mind
my cutting through your place.

4
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:03,920
- No, I guess not.
- I'm heading north.

5
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,840
Didn't expect to find
any fences around here.

6
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,040
Hello, boy.

7
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,440
- You were watching me, weren't you?
- Yes, I was.

8
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,760
I like a man who watches
things goin' around.

9
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:27,440
It means he'll make his mark some day.

10
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,920
Long time since I've seen a Jersey cow.

11
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:38,200
You'll see a lot more.
Jerseys and Holsteins...

12
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,600
...and the like.

13
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,360
- Can I offer you some water?
- Thanks.

14
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,840
You're a little touchy.

15
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,640
Joey!

16
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,320
- You know not to point guns at people.
- I wasn't pointing at anybody, Mother.

17
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,680
Sure had me snortin', son.

18
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,320
I just wanted you to see my rifle.

19
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:27,680
Bet you can shoot.

20
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,880
- Can't you?
- Little bit.

21
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:46,400
Looks like your friends are a little late.

22
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,400
What are the Ryker boys up to this time?

23
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,880
- Rykers?
- That's what I said.

24
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,360
I wouldn't know a Ryker
from your Jersey cow.

25
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,920
Don't forget to close the gate
on your way out.

26
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:03,320
Would you put down that gun?
Then I'll leave.

27
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,960
What's the difference?
You're leaving anyway.

28
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,720
I'd like it to be my idea.

29
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,560
Howdy, Starrett.

30
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,960
Expectin' trouble?

31
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:55,280
I don't want no trouble, Starrett.
I came to inform you.

32
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,200
I got that reservation beef contract.

33
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,440
- So many to tell me that?
- I mean business.

34
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:05,440
- Then, tend to your own.
- That's just what I'm doin'.

35
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,160
I'm gonna need all my range.

36
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,920
Now you've warned me,
get off my place.

37
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,080
Your place?

38
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,720
You'll have to get out before the snow.

39
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:20,160
- Supposin' I don't?
- You and the other squatters.

40
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:25,520
- Homesteaders, you mean.
- I could blast you outta here right now.

41
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:31,080
Listen to me. The time for gun-blastin'
a man off his place is passed.

42
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,080
- They're building a penitentiary...
- Joe, that's enough.

43
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,400
Who are you, stranger?

44
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:46,280
I'm a friend of Starrett's.

45
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:51,200
Well, Starrett, you can't say
I didn't warn you.

46
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:55,240
All right, you've told me.
Now get off my claim.

47
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:19,160
Supper'll be ready in a little while, Joe.
Won't be very long.

48
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,320
Wait, mister, I...

49
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:26,080
I swear, I... Wait a minute, please.

50
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,960
I take that back, what I...

51
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,120
Look, this... this thing ain't even loaded.

52
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:38,120
- Not loaded?
- No, Joey's too young to go loaded.

53
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,480
That's his gun.

54
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,680
If this don't beat all!

55
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:50,360
My name is Starrett, Joe Starrett,
and this here's Joey.

56
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,520
You heard what my little woman said.
Come on in, I feel like eatin'.

57
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:01,440
- You can call me Shane.
- Guess I spook kinda easy these days.

58
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,520
Hello, Joe.

59
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:11,440
My place ain't very much yet,
but my wife sure can cook!

60
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:17,400
It won't be long till supper.
You can wash up right here.

61
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:24,720
In case you wanted to know,
that's Ryker's spread all over there.

62
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:28,280
He thinks the whole world
belongs to him.

63
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,600
The old-timers can't see it yet,

64
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,560
but runnin' cattle
on an open range can't go on.

65
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,720
It takes too much space
for too little results.

66
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:40,640
Those herds aren't any good,
they're all horns and bone.

67
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:46,280
Cattle that is bred for meat and fenced in
and fed right, that's the thing.

68
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:51,280
You gotta pick your spot,
get your land, your own land.

69
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:55,520
A homesteader can't run but a few beef,
but he can grow grain,

70
00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:01,120
and then with his garden
and hogs and milk, he'll be all right.

71
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,960
We make out, don't we, Marian?

72
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,560
Of course.

73
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:18,040
It's that calf again.
Joey, chase her out of there.

74
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,200
Joey! Run on, son.

75
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,040
Don't forget to shut that gate.

76
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,840
Joey!

77
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,720
Come on, shoo!

78
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:43,240
I wouldn't ask you where you're bound.

79
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:49,160
One place or another.
Some place I've never been.

80
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:59,120
- The only way I'll leave is in a pine box.
- What do you mean, Pa?

81
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,960
I mean they'll have to shoot me
and carry me out.

82
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,360
- You shouldn't talk like that.
- It's the truth.

83
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:10,520
You love this place.
We've got our roots down.

84
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,480
- I wish you wouldn't talk that way.
- Our first real home.

85
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:19,120
- What did you mean...?
- Joey, be quiet. The men want to talk.

86
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:23,720
There's just more work here
than I can do.

87
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,480
If I could hire me a man that...

88
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,920
I had one once,
but the Rykers roughed him up,

89
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,520
so he lit out, cussin' me...

90
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,080
They knocked his teeth out.

91
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,600
Ready for pie?

92
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:44,760
If nobody else is gonna eat this biscuit,
I guess I'll have to.

93
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:00,840
- We're kind of fancy, aren't we?
- What is, Pa?

94
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,040
Good plates, an extra fork...

95
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,040
What about me, Ma?

96
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,280
- What's the matter, Marian?
- Nothing.

97
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:26,920
That was an elegant dinner, Mrs Starrett.

98
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,480
Excuse me.

99
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,120
Where's Mr Shane going?
He didn't even say goodbye.

100
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,800
He's not going, Joey.
He wouldn't go without taking that.

101
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,880
I'm going outside with him.

102
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:50,440
- Did you ask him to stay the night?
- I'll do that right now.

103
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:58,640
Well, I'll be doggone.
Come here a minute.

104
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:51,880
Joe, why don't you hitch up the team?

105
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:57,240
Marian, I've been fighting this stump
off and on for two years.

106
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,400
Use the team now,
this stump could say it beat us.

107
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:05,960
Sometimes nothing will do
but your own sweat and muscle.

108
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,560
All right.

109
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,200
Bang! Bang!

110
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:50,120
I wish they'd give me
some bullets for this gun.

111
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,720
- Good morning, Joey.
- How did you know it was me?

112
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,880
Well, I figured the cow
couldn't work that latch.

113
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,360
- Why are you up so early?
- You're to stay for breakfast.

114
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,240
Oh... Well, thank you.

115
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:19,600
- Then where will you go?
- Where would you say, Joey?

116
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,040
I wish you'd stay here.

117
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,840
- Would you teach me to shoot?
- You'd like to learn to shoot?

118
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:34,040
Pa wishes you'd stay, too.
I heard him tell Mother.

119
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,640
He said he didn't want you
to fight his fights for him,

120
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,520
just help with the work.

121
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,280
I bet you wouldn't leave
just because it's dangerous.

122
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,080
Joey!

123
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,720
Joey, come here this minute.

124
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:54,400
I hope you'll stay, Mr Shane.
Coming, Mother!

125
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,440
Close the gate, Joey.

126
00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:01,760
What are you doing in your nightshirt?
Come in and put your clothes on.

127
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:06,880
Would you like to hitch up the team
and haul that wire from Grafton's?

128
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:10,720
- Anything you say.
- Get off the bed. Go on!

129
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:13,760
He's holding it for me at the store.

130
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:19,280
While you're there, you might as well
get yourself some work clothes.

131
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,880
- What can I bring Joey?
- Soda-pop!

132
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,280
You don't need anything, Joey.

133
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,640
Be careful. I don't want my troubles
to be none of yours.

134
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,200
Aren't you wearing your six-shooter?

135
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:35,040
I didn't know there was
any wild game in town, Joey.

136
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,600
Come on, son.

137
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,840
Joey, come back here!

138
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,400
Bang!

139
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,120
Bang!

140
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:01,520
- Who are you shootin' at?
- Rykers. Bang!

141
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,240
- Did you get many?
- Missed one.

142
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,040
Well, can't stand for that.

143
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:10,920
Pa, do you guess
Shane will teach me to shoot?

144
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:15,080
I'll teach you myself
once I get the time, Joey.

145
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:21,760
- Can you shoot as good as Shane?
- I've never seen him shoot.

146
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,800
But I doubt it.

147
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,400
He didn't wear his gun today.
Why's that, Pa?

148
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:33,240
Well, he's tradin' at the store,
not holdin' it up.

149
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,240
But why, Pa? Honest, why didn't he?

150
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:42,240
- I don't wear one myself.
- It goes with him, though.

151
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:46,920
- Somebody's coming, Joe.
- I know. It's Ernie Wright.

152
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:55,480
Could you whip him, Pa?
Could you whip Shane?

153
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:59,400
- Can't you ask nothing but questions?
- But could you?

154
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,320
Oh, maybe.

155
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:07,000
No call for that though, Joey.
Shane's on our side.

156
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,400
Howdy, Joe.

157
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,320
How are you, Ernie?

158
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:14,000
- No good.
- What's the matter?

159
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,160
I'm pulling stakes.
No use of your talking.

160
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:22,680
- Now what's the matter?
- My wheat. Them Rykers raided it.

161
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:27,000
Fence cut, steers drove in.
It's just stubs now.

162
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,960
- When?
- Last night.

163
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:32,640
I'm leaving, and don't try
to talk me out of it.

164
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:36,120
- You can't...
- Just don't try, that's all.

165
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,600
- I listened to you too much already.
- Go ahead, nobody's holding you.

166
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:44,480
You wouldn't leave
your home and land, and...

167
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,800
Oh, Ernie, you...

168
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,840
I'm wore down and out. Tired of being
insulted by them fellas.

169
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:55,640
Called a pig-farmer.
Who knows what comes next?

170
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,560
Well, don't throw your tail up.

171
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:04,560
Tell you what, we'll all get together here
tonight and figure out something.

172
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,600
I don't know about me.

173
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:11,720
I'll get the word around.
You tell Shipstead and Torrey.

174
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:15,040
All right,
but if we're having a meeting,

175
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:19,600
it'd better be more than pokin' holes
in the air with your finger.

176
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:53,560
- Anything I can do you for?
- I came to get wire for Joe Starrett.

177
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,440
I've been holding wire
for Starrett for quite a spell.

178
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:02,280
- Are you new?
- Yes, I'm working for Starrett.

179
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,080
- Got ready-made pants to fit me?
- Farm rig?

180
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:09,200
I outfit all these farmers.

181
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:17,800
- Step right in back and try 'em on.
- Thanks.

182
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,880
Will.

183
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,680
Hey, Will.

184
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,480
You're thirsty, ain't you, Chris?

185
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:45,000
- Will! Who's tendin' bar round here?
- Comin' right in.

186
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,120
- How is it?
- Good enough.

187
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:00,360
- How much do I owe you?
- Now, let's see...

188
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:04,920
Pants, a dollar. Two shirts, 60 cents.

189
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,600
Belt...

190
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:17,440
Young man, you owe me
two dollars and two bits.

191
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:20,960
What's the matter, son?
You look kinda pale.

192
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:24,560
Been a long time since
I got store-bought clothes.

193
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,360
Money don't go very far these days.

194
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:30,760
A new sodbuster?

195
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,600
Thought I smelled pigs.

196
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:37,760
- Anything else?
- Got any soda-pop?

197
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:43,200
I sure do. I wish more men
around here would drink it.

198
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:46,360
- In my bar, in there.
- Thanks.

199
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:05,920
Will! Let's keep the smell of pigs
out from where we're drinking.

200
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,800
- Bartender.
- What can I do for you?

201
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,600
Do you have any soda-pop?

202
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:25,040
Are you gonna get him out
or do I have to?

203
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,840
Let me take him, Chris.

204
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,920
What'll it be?

205
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:42,080
Lemon, strawberry or lilac, sodbuster?

206
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,000
You speaking to me?

207
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,560
I don't see
nobody else standing there.

208
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,640
Here, have some of this.

209
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:01,320
Smell like a man.

210
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:06,480
Don't it smell better in here, Grafton?
Chris just fumigated a sodbuster.

211
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,680
Just take it easy.

212
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:12,920
I was just asking about sody-pop,

213
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:17,200
pigs and taters
and one thing and another.

214
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:21,680
Which one of them tater-pickers
are you working for?

215
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:25,160
Or are you just
squatting on the range?

216
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,960
Joe Starrett, if it's any of your business.

217
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:32,320
Supposing I make it my business?

218
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:42,000
Here's your soda-pop, mister.

219
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:51,240
Now you and your soda-pop
get outta here and stay outta here.

220
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,160
And don't come back!

221
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:10,160
Did you see that, Rufe?
Chris just put the run on a sodbuster.

222
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,640
That's it. Keep 'em on the move.

223
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,200
Warm it up for you?

224
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,160
It's getting so I don't like
to ride at night.

225
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,400
Let's hope the meeting starts...

226
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:31,680
- Is Shane going to be at the meeting?
- Mr Shane. Yes, I suppose so.

227
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,280
We all know why we're here.

228
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:38,040
Ryker's war-party's
been around to see all of us.

229
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:44,240
I'm here to tell you,
I ain't leavin' now or any other time.

230
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:47,360
Start with you, Axel. What do you say?

231
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:50,360
Well, Joe, you see...

232
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:53,480
I know what I want to say.
Start with me.

233
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:58,280
Ernie, we're gonna hear
everybody in turn. Go ahead.

234
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,040
Most of you don't know Shane.

235
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,640
- Shane, this is Yank Potts.
- Howdy.

236
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:07,240
- Fred Lewis here.
- I seen you in town.

237
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,720
Ernie Wright here, and Ed Howells.

238
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:13,720
- And Johnson.
- Howdy, Shane.

239
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,960
- See anybody else coming?
- No.

240
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:20,560
- We're waiting for Torrey.
- How far is Ryker gonna push us?

241
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,640
Let's not talk scared,
that's what Ryker wants.

242
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:27,600
He thinks he can shoo us off
like a flock of chickens.

243
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,440
Here's Torrey.

244
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:32,120
- Hello, Reb.
- Hello, Yank.

245
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,920
About time you showed up.

246
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:42,400
That's enough out of you, Yank.

247
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:46,920
- And you, too.
- All right. Cool off, Stonewall.

248
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,680
Shake hands with Shane, there.
Shane's working for me.

249
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,840
Shane. Oh, yeah...

250
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:57,160
I heard about you, at Grafton's.

251
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,040
Go on, Joe.

252
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:06,080
Well, Stonewall, it's like this...
Leaving Ernie out, maybe,

253
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:08,520
we've all agreed we're gonna stick.

254
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:12,720
Now you're whistling.
Ain't nobody pushing me off my claim.

255
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:17,320
- I think you all know that I'm staying.
- I, too, will stay.

256
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:21,120
I'll string along,
leastways till the shooting starts.

257
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:25,360
There ain't but seven of us,
if it comes to a fight.

258
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,240
- Him.
- That's eight.

259
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:32,480
- Can't count on him.
- He's proved that much.

260
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,440
Watch what you're saying.

261
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:38,400
Shane can tell you what happened
with Ryker's man, Chris.

262
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,880
They're talking about Shane!

263
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,920
What is this, Shane?

264
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,240
Let him say.

265
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:53,800
- Lewis seen and heard it.
- He let Chris buffalo him at Grafton's.

266
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,200
Fred, I told Shane
to stay away from trouble.

267
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:03,240
- Let's finish the story.
- He didn't. Shane didn't let him do that!

268
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:09,600
This Chris went around bragging
he put the run on a sodbuster.

269
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,920
Shane, you don't have to leave.

270
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:20,440
I figured you could talk freer
if I weren't around.

271
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,360
It's too late to finish this now.

272
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:29,040
- He didn't, did he?
- Joey, I want you to go to sleep.

273
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:33,160
- It's all right, everything's all right.
- Shane isn't going away?

274
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,560
No, he isn't. Now, get back into bed.

275
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,840
Stay there.

276
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,000
- Shane.
- Shane!

277
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:52,200
- I know you ain't afraid.
- It's a long story, Joey.

278
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,760
I think we know...

279
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,120
...Shane.

280
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:07,400
Don't stand in the rain.
You'll catch your death of cold!

281
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:18,080
So, on Saturday, we'll get together
and go into town for our supplies.

282
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:22,280
That's a good idea.
There's some strength in a whole bunch.

283
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:28,200
I don't need no bodyguard.
I'll put on my.38 and go when I please.

284
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,840
- Joey.
- Yes?

285
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:42,440
Don't get to liking Shane too much.

286
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,240
Why not?

287
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:49,480
I don't want you to.

288
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:55,640
- Is there anything wrong with him?
- No.

289
00:28:55,840 --> 00:29:00,560
- Then what, Mother?
- He'll be moving on one day, Joey.

290
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:05,840
You'll be upset,
if you get to liking him too much.

291
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:14,240
- Marian, you're pretty enough, come on!
- I'm coming!

292
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:19,520
I wish she'd hurry so we could get going.
I don't like this business.

293
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,280
Get in the wagon, son.

294
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:37,960
One thing a married man has
to get used to is waiting for women.

295
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:42,040
- Hurry up, Ma!
- Here she comes.

296
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,760
- Good afternoon.
- Hello.

297
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:47,560
Sometimes the waiting is worth it.

298
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,600
Take care and get a woman
worth waiting for.

299
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,480
Water's good.

300
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,760
Think I can get ready
as quickly as you?

301
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:03,440
Hold your horses, we wanted
to see how pretty you were.

302
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,640
Come on here.

303
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,840
All set?

304
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,760
Come on, girls!

305
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,720
- Hello!
- Morning.

306
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:53,360
- Are you all set?
- Reckon we are.

307
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,000
- Hello, Marian!
- Where's Stonewall?

308
00:30:56,200 --> 00:31:00,760
He got thirsty and went on in.
Said he had business that couldn't wait.

309
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,800
I got to stay and mind the girls.

310
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,640
- Bye!
- Bye!

311
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:12,320
- Come on, Red.
- Bye, Marian!

312
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:22,360
Stonewall, what are you doing?
We agreed to come together.

313
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:27,640
I had a little business to attend to.
We can't buy a drink.

314
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:31,840
Get down off that horse.
You're acting like a darn fool.

315
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:45,440
A whole bunch came in. They brought
their women to protect them.

316
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:50,840
- My jars come yet?
- Howdy, Starrett. What can I do you for?

317
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:53,160
My, my, my...!

318
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,320
What will they think of next?

319
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,320
Susan!

320
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:03,760
- Did you bring your mother's list?
- Yes, Pa.

321
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:06,240
Get the coal oil can from the wagon.

322
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:09,680
My woman want we get together
on the Fourth of July.

323
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:14,080
We make big celebration,
don't we, Marian?

324
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,520
Fine, that's just what we need.

325
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:20,040
It's Joe Starrett's anniversary,
the Fourth of July.

326
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:23,600
- We'll have a big party.
- Mr Grafton...

327
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,720
Have you got gunpowder
for the fireworks?

328
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:32,120
- How about some of those jellies...?
- We'll talk about that later.

329
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:35,280
- What do I get for the empty?
- The usual.

330
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,520
- Thank you.
- Give the bottle to Will.

331
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:43,960
I need some white flour, Mr Grafton,
and four pounds of coffee.

332
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,920
Joey.

333
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:52,840
- Let me take it in.
- You come, too, Shane.

334
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,000
Thank you.

335
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,680
Well, now looký here what we got.

336
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:19,360
That's one of the new ones.
They call him Sody-Pop.

337
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:23,160
- Deal me out.
- What's the matter, Pete?

338
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:27,120
Just say I'm superstitious, that's all.

339
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:35,480
I guess you don't hear very well,
sodbuster.

340
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:42,320
I told you, if you want to keep healthy,
stay out of here. Now, get going.

341
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:51,960
Look, pig-farmer. Get back with
the women and kids, where it's safe.

342
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:56,360
Don't push it, Calloway.

343
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:00,560
Did you hear me? I said get going.

344
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:08,360
Did you think you were gonna come
and drink with the men?

345
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:11,760
Set 'em up, bartender. Two whiskies.

346
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:15,280
You bought me a drink
last time I was in here.

347
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:18,840
Now I want to buy you one.

348
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,960
You ain't gonna drink that in here.

349
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,040
You guessed it.

350
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,120
Let me have him.

351
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,640
- Let him go.
- Let me have him.

352
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:52,040
Go get him, Chris.

353
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:59,760
Tear him apart!

354
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,360
Get that sodbuster.

355
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:06,080
- Hang one on him, Chris.
- Bust him.

356
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:08,520
Break his back.

357
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,880
This is bad, this is bad.

358
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:14,600
- I'm going in there.
- No, Stonewall, stay right here.

359
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,600
If we join in, we'll get run out.

360
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,760
- Go on!
- Go get him, Chris.

361
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:28,480
There ain't a marshal
within a hundred-mile ride.

362
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,960
Get after him, Chris.

363
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,280
Plough him under, Chris.

364
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:42,240
Beat his brains out!

365
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:54,480
Get him!

366
00:36:56,600 --> 00:37:01,360
- Land that right, Chris.
- Knock him into that pigpen, Chris!

367
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:09,760
Dirty pig-farmer!

368
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,680
- Stop this!
- Go on, get at it.

369
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,160
Here, men, stop this!

370
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,800
Settle it outside.

371
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:09,280
- Looks like it's all over.
- We should get out of here.

372
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:16,720
- Maybe you'd like to draw straws.
- Hold on, young fella.

373
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:20,360
You may have a friend
you don't know you've got.

374
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:24,640
- I could use a man like you.
- I'm working for Starrett.

375
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:29,840
You don't belong on the end of a shovel.
Anything to stop you drawin' your time?

376
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,200
I like working for Starrett.

377
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:37,760
- Whatever he's paying, I'll double.
- It's no use.

378
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:41,440
- What are you looking for?
- Nothing.

379
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:50,080
- Pretty wife, Starrett's got.
- You dirty old man!

380
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:53,440
- People don't talk to me that way.
- I'm talking that way.

381
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:58,040
You had a chance. Nobody messes up
my boys and gets away with it.

382
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,720
We'll ride you out of this valley.

383
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:05,560
Gonna rough you up and ride you out
and you're gonna stay out.

384
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:11,880
- Shane, come on!
- Joey, get out of here.

385
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:17,040
But, Shane, there's too many.

386
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:21,680
You wouldn't want me to run away,
would you?

387
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:26,640
But there's too many, Shane.

388
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,680
Go on, son, please.

389
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:42,840
- Stop!
- I'll pay the damages.

390
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,280
- No more fighting.
- Keep outta this.

391
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:48,400
- This man's unarmed.
- It ain't a shooting.

392
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:51,120
Quit butting in.

393
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:53,280
I'll take him.

394
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:01,360
Stop it, men! Stop fighting!

395
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,960
Stop it, men.

396
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:21,080
Stop this!

397
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,400
Break his neck!

398
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:41,640
- Where's Joey?
- Pa, they're going to kill Shane!

399
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:45,000
- They're trying to kill him!
- Stay with your mother.

400
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,800
- Don't go in.
- Shane's in there.

401
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,080
What Ryker's got coming
ain't fit for a woman to see.

402
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,400
Don't go in there, Joe...

403
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,800
Beat his brains in!

404
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:58,400
Stop it!

405
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,800
Stop it!

406
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:07,160
Stop it! You fools have had enough of it.
You'll all get killed.

407
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:12,120
Starrett, you and Shane
back on out of here.

408
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:18,440
That's making some sense, Starrett.
You've won.

409
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,480
- Get out of here.
- Ryker ain't paying for this damage.

410
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:27,280
I'm paying for what's broke.

411
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:32,840
No, by Godfrey, we're paying
for what's broke, me and Shane!

412
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:46,040
Morgan, put one of the boys
on a good horse.

413
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:51,400
He's got a long trip,
all the way to Cheyenne.

414
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:54,400
I'm through fooling, Grafton.

415
00:42:54,600 --> 00:43:01,360
From now on, when we fight with them,
the air's gonna be full of gunsmoke.

416
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:07,160
- I saw it all, Mother, every bit.
- It's no place for you, Joey.

417
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:09,440
No place for you either, Marian.

418
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:14,520
I was scared. Then Pa picked up
that man and slung him on the floor.

419
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:18,280
I didn't do much. It was all Shane.

420
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:21,200
- How are you feeling?
- Better.

421
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:25,840
You did, Joe.
It was ugly and you were both wonderful.

422
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:30,560
When that chair came down on you,
Shane, I thought you were a goner.

423
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:33,680
It was an easy chair, Joey.

424
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:39,560
I bet you two could lick anyone.

425
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:43,880
Well, one thing's for sure,
Ryker's gonna think twice.

426
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:49,480
- Don't talk about Ryker any more now.
- I wish we could forget him.

427
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:57,440
- This turpentine'll hurt.
- He wouldn't say nothing.

428
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:00,680
No matter how much it hurt.
Would you, Shane?

429
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:04,480
I'm afraid I would, Joey,
if it hurt bad enough.

430
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:09,520
- It stings like anything.
- Joey, go on to bed.

431
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:14,560
It does smart, I know.

432
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:17,280
- Ouch!
- Gosh!

433
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:22,040
- Joey, for the last time, go to bed.
- Yeah, me, too.

434
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:24,400
Come on, son.

435
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:28,560
- Will you kiss me goodnight, Mother?
- All right.

436
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:32,720
Your head...
Your head needs a bandage.

437
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:39,000
It's good enough, Marian, it's fine.
Thanks very much.

438
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:46,080
- You wanna know something, Mother?
- What is it?

439
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:53,640
- What is it, Joey?
- Mother...

440
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:59,000
- I just love Shane.
- Do you?

441
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:02,440
I love him almost as much as I love Pa.

442
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:06,000
That's all right, isn't it?

443
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:11,000
- He's a fine man.
- He's so good.

444
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:15,200
Don't you like him, Mother?

445
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:18,720
Yes, I like him, too, Joey.

446
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:21,280
Goodnight, Joey.

447
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:36,920
What's the matter, honey?

448
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:39,720
Joe...

449
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:43,880
Hold me.

450
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:48,760
Don't say anything. Just hold me tight.

451
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:04,160
- 'Night, Ma!
- Goodnight, Joey.

452
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:07,920
- 'Night, Pa!
- 'Night, son.

453
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:11,480
'Night, Shane!

454
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:09,040
Where's Ryker?

455
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:13,680
He's getting a little sleep.

456
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:17,360
- He sent for me.
- Sit down for a minute.

457
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:20,520
We're having a celebration today.

458
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:26,520
- Where's the coffee?
- I'll put it right on.

459
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:37,560
- What's going on here?
- Plenty.

460
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:41,160
- Going somewhere?
- Looks that way, don't it?

461
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:43,840
Don't let 'em bluff you, Ernie.

462
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:46,200
Bluff, huh?

463
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:51,160
See that?
They killed my sow last night.

464
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:55,480
Kept shooting
and yelling what they'd do next.

465
00:47:55,680 --> 00:48:00,160
Woke up the kids and
scared the missus half to death.

466
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:05,000
- We're gonna put a stop to that.
- I said I'd stay for one more hand.

467
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:09,000
Well, this is it. I had enough of Ryker.

468
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:14,400
Here they come again!

469
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:36,880
Right through my ploughed ground.

470
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:41,720
What do you think of that,
Stonewall Torrey?

471
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:46,320
Starrett and the rest of us
are gonna take the juice out of 'em,

472
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:49,360
one of these days.

473
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:52,880
Anyhow, I'm going to Grafton's
to get a bottle.

474
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:57,560
- Show 'em it's Independence Day.
- Ma, you getting ready?

475
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:02,960
- Good luck.
- Good luck for you, too, Stonewall.

476
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:08,200
Can't see a pig in sight!

477
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:12,360
I don't see none,
but I sure can smell 'em.

478
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:24,560
They cut Mr Wright's fence
and Mr Shipstead's, too.

479
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:26,800
They did?

480
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:32,360
Shane, what would you do
if you caught them cutting our fence?

481
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:35,600
I'd ask them
to please go around by the gate.

482
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:37,600
Oh, Shane!

483
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:44,480
- Come on, I'll race you to the barn.
- It's a go!

484
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:22,080
Why don't you ever wear
your six-shooter, Shane?

485
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:26,160
I guess I don't see
as many bad men as you do.

486
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:30,040
Shane.

487
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:36,360
- You want me to tell you something?
- If you want to.

488
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:40,320
I saw your gun in there, one day.

489
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:47,600
- I took a look at it.
- Oh?

490
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:53,200
- Are you mad?
- No, I guess not.

491
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:57,200
But if I were you,
I'd leave a thing like this alone.

492
00:50:57,400 --> 00:51:01,960
- I wrapped it up in the blanket again.
- That's a good boy.

493
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,120
Could I see it again?

494
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:09,640
You promised you'd show me
how to shoot.

495
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:14,080
Please!

496
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:16,160
All right, Joey. Come on.

497
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:26,440
Get 'em up!

498
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:30,360
We've got some learning to do!
Come on.

499
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:32,760
You stand right here.

500
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:36,400
All right, put your arms
down to your side.

501
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:40,840
Your holster's too low.
Never have your holster at arm's length.

502
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:43,240
Let's fix this.

503
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:48,520
You always have it here, with the grip
between the elbow and the wrist.

504
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:50,480
So when your hand comes up,

505
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:54,640
the gun clears the holster
without coming up too high, see?

506
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:57,960
Now you try it, real fast and straight.
That's it.

507
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:02,760
- Gosh! Is that what real gunfighters do?
- No, Joey.

508
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:05,920
Most of them have tricks of their own.

509
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:08,960
One, for instance,
likes a shoulder holster.

510
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:13,280
Another one puts it
in the belt of his pants.

511
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:18,160
And some like two guns.
But one's all you need if you can use it...

512
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:23,080
...after 15 paces. No good for putting
a bullet where you want it.

513
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:24,960
Which is the best way?

514
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:28,960
What I'm telling you is as good as any,
better than most.

515
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:34,080
- Let me see you shoot.
- What do you want me to shoot at?

516
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:37,440
The little white rock over there, see?

517
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:52,160
Gosh, almighty, that is good!

518
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:59,360
You see, Joey?
Now look. Remember.

519
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:02,520
When your hand comes up,
you still clear your holster.

520
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:06,520
- Shane.
- Hello, Mrs Starrett.

521
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:09,920
- I was teaching Joey a little shooting.
- I don't want...

522
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:13,760
You ought to see Shane shoot.
He's teaching me.

523
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:19,240
- Yes, I know. Get ready for the party.
- Oh, Ma!

524
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:22,000
Guns aren't going to be my boy's life.

525
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:25,960
Why do you always
have to spoil everything?

526
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:29,800
A gun is a tool,
no better or worse than any other tool,

527
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,520
an axe, a shovel, or anything.

528
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:38,280
A gun is as good or as bad
as the man using it. Remember that.

529
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:43,520
We'd all be better off
if there wasn't a single gun in this valley,

530
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:46,360
including yours.

531
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:49,680
What's all the shooting about?

532
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:55,240
You're starting the celebrating
a little early, aren't you?

533
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:59,840
Well, look at that woman,
in her wedding dress!

534
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:02,560
Shane, you better hitch up that team,

535
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:07,720
'cause today we're really gonna
celebrate the Fourth of July!

536
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:28,120
I'm supposed to say to the squatters,
"I'm busted but you're welcome."

537
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:31,320
- It ain't that bad.
- That's easy for you to say.

538
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:35,120
I've been your friend a long time,
I'm reasonable.

539
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:40,360
- But something's got to give.
- Out here a man can go just so far.

540
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:45,120
I've gone along with the new law.
I've stayed away from gunfighting.

541
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:48,200
Sure, I've tried to buffalo the sodbusters.

542
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:53,440
You got to admit,
my men have kept their six-guns cased.

543
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:56,680
And now?

544
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:18,440
- I can guess what's on your mind.
- Keep your guesses to yourself.

545
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:23,120
- I like Joe Starrett.
- Fool oughta listen to reason.

546
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:26,680
- Your reason?
- What's the matter with you?

547
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:29,480
No offence, Rufe.

548
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:35,120
It's your own conscience eating on you.

549
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:38,080
Conscience!

550
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:45,960
Hello, Torrey.
Something I can do you for?

551
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:51,880
- A jug. It's the Fourth.
- Come in, come in.

552
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:03,520
Jug. And a whiskey.

553
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:23,480
Here's to you, Ryker,
for running Ernie Wright off his claim.

554
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:27,400
Another.

555
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:30,560
- Is that one of them?
- Yeah.

556
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:36,720
It's a downright dirty shame.
It's all he had and he worked hard for it.

557
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:45,560
I want to tell you something, Ryker.
He's running because he's a coward.

558
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:52,720
And here's to me, 'cause I ain't a coward
and you ain't getting my claim.

559
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:55,880
They're hot-headed.

560
00:56:56,080 --> 00:57:00,760
You'd get him to draw
without any trouble.

561
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:02,920
It'd be easy.

562
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:08,680
You can't scare me
any more than you can Joe Starrett.

563
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:16,080
No. It's Starrett we want.

564
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:21,120
- Three cheers for Wyoming!
- The rest of you care to join me?

565
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:24,360
Drink a toast to the greatest state
in the Union?

566
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:27,320
I'm from Wyoming.

567
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:37,200
Here's to the independence
of the sovereign state of Alabama.

568
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:43,920
There you are.

569
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:43,800
I'm through with all you Yanks.
Listen, you Yankees...!

570
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,360
Hello, Axel.

571
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:48,880
You're late, Reb,
we took Richmond two hours ago!

572
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:52,360
- Everybody, come here...
- Marian!

573
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:56,040
You come too,
I have something important to tell you.

574
00:58:56,240 --> 00:59:01,160
- Axel...
- Ja, Mama. Now...

575
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:06,360
You all know what today is.
It's Independence Day.

576
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:09,880
Except for one man here. Yes, sir.

577
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:15,040
This was the day Joe Starrett
got himself hooked, by golly!

578
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,720
Well, no...

579
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:26,000
- What I'd like to say is...
- Well, say it, Joe!

580
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:31,080
- I'd like to say that Axel's right.
- What did he say, Joe?

581
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:35,920
I gave up my independence
10 years ago today.

582
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:40,120
But no man ever gave it up
as easy as I did.

583
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:46,600
And what's more, I wouldn't trade
places with any man in this world.

584
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:51,120
- Good speech!
- Go on, Joe, give her a kiss.

585
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:54,400
Come here!

586
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:19,560
Congratulations.

587
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:23,520
Pass the word to the boys,
I got some cheer for us.

588
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:26,600
Many more, Joe!

589
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:29,880
We were ready to give you up,
you and Ernie.

590
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:33,760
Ernie's getting out today.
Packed up kit and caboodle.

591
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:37,320
- Been expecting that.
- Ryker's boys bluffed him out.

592
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:41,040
- Maybe he had sense.
- What were you doing in town?

593
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:52,880
- Joe, I want to dance.
- Marian, they've fenced me out here.

594
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:57,760
- Joe don't want you in town by yourself.
- It's just Ryker and Grafton gabbing.

595
01:01:57,960 --> 01:01:59,520
Grafton's OK.

596
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:03,120
Another man was there,
likely hired by Ryker.

597
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:07,800
- Who was that?
- Stranger, decked out like a gunfighter.

598
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:12,000
- Did you say "guns"?
- Yeah, two guns.

599
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:17,560
- What did he look like?
- Packs two guns, kinda lean...

600
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:19,800
He wears a black hat.

601
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,760
- Is he a friend of yours?
- No.

602
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:26,440
A man named Wilson looks like that,
a gunfighter.

603
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:29,400
- Jack Wilson?
- Gunfighter outta Cheyenne.

604
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:33,000
- Can't be him, can it?
- I didn't ask him his name.

605
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:36,680
- What about him?
- What's a gunman doing around here?

606
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:40,880
- Pow-wow with Ryker?
- Don't start. We don't know it's Wilson.

607
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:45,200
This Wilson, would you know him,
Shane? If you saw him?

608
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:52,240
Maybe. If it is Wilson,
he's fast on the draw, so be careful.

609
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:56,560
You seem to know a lot about
this kind of business, Shane.

610
01:02:56,760 --> 01:02:59,840
That is enough. Come and eat
before things get cold.

611
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:03,720
I don't want no part of gunslinging.
Murder's a better name.

612
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:09,080
We eat now, everyone.
You fellas get the shoe game!

613
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:13,000
Torrey, I want to go to the blacksmith's,

614
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:16,480
but Joe says we shouldn't go alone.

615
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:20,800
Any time you wanna go to town,
I'll ride along with you.

616
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:24,320
I'm a soldier who's done fighting
in real battles.

617
01:03:24,520 --> 01:03:26,400
I can shoot just as straight...

618
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:36,800
Shane...

619
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:41,000
- Yes, Joey?
- Think that was him?

620
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:45,360
- Who?
- That man Torrey seen in town.

621
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:48,440
Do you think that was Wilson?

622
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:53,880
- Don't worry about things like that.
- Rest, Joey. It's past your bedtime.

623
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:56,160
Yes, Mother.

624
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:02,560
- No, Joey. I'll open it.
- All right.

625
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:05,600
All right. I'll open the gate for you.

626
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:08,040
Who goes there?

627
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:12,320
Brother Rufe's come
to pay you a little visit.

628
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:29,280
Howdy, Starrett.

629
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:33,240
Evening, ma'am.

630
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:37,960
I had somethin' I wanted
to talk over with you.

631
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:42,200
Whatever business we got,
we can talk over right here.

632
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:47,160
I'll just lay it on the barrelhead, then.
How'd you like to work for me?

633
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:50,480
I work for myself.
Done enough working for others.

634
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:52,800
Wait till I tell you.

635
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:58,160
I'll pay you top wages. More than
you make on this patch of ground.

636
01:04:58,360 --> 01:05:00,720
No, I'm not interested.

637
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:06,400
I haven't said it all.
You can run your cattle with mine.

638
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:09,840
What's more, I'll buy your homestead.

639
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:14,480
Set a price you think is reasonable,
you'll find me reasonable.

640
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:16,880
Is that fair?

641
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:20,800
You've made things hard for us,
and we're in the right.

642
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:24,560
Right? You in the right?

643
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:33,320
When I came to this country,
you weren't much older than your boy.

644
01:05:34,320 --> 01:05:40,080
We had rough times. Me and other men
that are mostly dead now.

645
01:05:40,280 --> 01:05:44,720
I got a bad shoulder yet
from a Cheyenne arrowhead.

646
01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:49,120
We made this country,
we found it and we made it,

647
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:52,280
with blood and empty bellies.

648
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:56,720
Cattle we brought in were hazed off
by Indians and rustlers.

649
01:05:56,920 --> 01:06:00,880
They don't bother you much any more
because we handled 'em.

650
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:04,320
We made a safe range out of this.

651
01:06:04,520 --> 01:06:08,560
Some of us died doing it,
but we made it.

652
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:14,080
Then people move in who never
had to raw-hide it through the old days.

653
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:19,240
They fence off my range
and fence me off from water.

654
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:24,800
Some of them plough ditches,
take out irrigation water.

655
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:31,280
So the creek runs dry sometimes
and I gotta move my stock because of it.

656
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:34,960
And you say we have no right
to the range.

657
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:39,160
The men that did the work
and ran the risks have no rights?

658
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:44,280
I take you for a fair man, Starrett.

659
01:06:45,320 --> 01:06:50,400
I'm not belittling what you did,
but you didn't find this country.

660
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:54,200
There were trappers here
and Indian traders before you.

661
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:57,840
- They tamed this country.
- They weren't ranchers.

662
01:06:58,040 --> 01:07:02,840
Rights! You think you've the right
to say nobody else has got any.

663
01:07:03,040 --> 01:07:05,960
That ain't the way
the Government looks at it.

664
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:11,680
I didn't come to argue.
I made you a fair proposition.

665
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:13,880
What about the others?

666
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:17,760
- Shane knows he can work for me.
- The other homesteaders?

667
01:07:17,960 --> 01:07:20,320
Look, be reasonable!

668
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:26,080
After all, there's just so many hands
in a deck of cards.

669
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:34,440
- Then, I've got to say no.
- You don't give a man much choice.

670
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:46,480
How do you feel about it, son?
Would you like to go partners with me?

671
01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:51,280
I don't want trouble with your father.
We don't want anyone to get hurt.

672
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:56,040
- Joey ain't quite of age, Ryker.
- How about it, son?

673
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:58,520
Come here, Joey.

674
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:10,240
I don't want you to be sorry, Starrett.

675
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:14,680
I'll see you.

676
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:33,720
What do you make of him?

677
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:36,840
He's no cow-puncher.

678
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:39,760
No. He doesn't look the part.

679
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:14,600
I like Starrett, too,
but I'll kill him if I have to.

680
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:20,520
- I'll kill him if I have to.
- You mean I'll kill him if you have to.

681
01:09:20,720 --> 01:09:25,480
I can't have any run-in with the law.
You heard Grafton.

682
01:09:25,680 --> 01:09:31,440
Just get Starrett in here.
It wouldn't take much to bait him.

683
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:38,400
Well, looký here.

684
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:46,960
Looký here.

685
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:08,560
Why don't we just gun him
and get on with it?

686
01:10:08,760 --> 01:10:13,720
One's run already.
It won't take much to stampede the rest.

687
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:22,080
Remember, Wilson, you got
to make this look right to Grafton.

688
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:25,440
Hey, come here!

689
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:33,520
Torrey... I wouldn't go over there, Torrey.

690
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:36,680
Nobody's gonna buffalo me.

691
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:55,200
- What can I do for you?
- Where do you think you're going?

692
01:11:56,240 --> 01:11:58,600
- To get a whiskey.
- Torrey.

693
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:06,360
Torrey.

694
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:18,600
Torrey.

695
01:12:46,680 --> 01:12:49,920
They tell me they call you "Stonewall".

696
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:55,400
- Anything wrong with that?
- It's just funny.

697
01:12:58,360 --> 01:13:01,680
I guess they named a lot of that...

698
01:13:01,880 --> 01:13:05,200
...Southern trash after old Stonewall.

699
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:13,040
Who'd they name you after?
Or would you know?

700
01:13:14,280 --> 01:13:20,080
I'm saying that "Stonewall" Jackson
was trash himself.

701
01:13:20,280 --> 01:13:25,240
Him and Lee,
and all the rest of them Rebs.

702
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:29,480
You, too.

703
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:35,040
- You're a low-down, lying Yankee.
- Prove it.

704
01:13:37,480 --> 01:13:38,960
No, Torrey!

705
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:04,560
One less sodbuster.

706
01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:09,040
- What?
- He tried to pull on Wilson.

707
01:14:09,240 --> 01:14:13,640
- Ain't that right, Swede?
- He tried to reach for a...

708
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:17,440
All right. Get him outta here.

709
01:14:19,240 --> 01:14:22,360
Tell your friends
we'll be waiting for any more

710
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:25,520
that come in looking for trouble.

711
01:14:27,080 --> 01:14:29,560
You understand that, Swede?

712
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:32,920
Now get him outta here.

713
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:36,640
- What happened?
- The sodbuster tried to kill Wilson.

714
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:42,840
- What's the shooting?
- Sodbuster tried to pull on Wilson.

715
01:14:49,960 --> 01:14:51,720
Lewis!

716
01:14:53,480 --> 01:14:58,160
- Lewis!
- Pa! What's happened?

717
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:03,240
- Lewis!
- Fred!

718
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:06,160
Fred!

719
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:22,920
Torrey, he is dead!

720
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:26,160
Ryker did it!

721
01:15:29,320 --> 01:15:31,480
I'll go get Starrett.

722
01:15:36,040 --> 01:15:39,640
Shane, we sure enough
earned our keep today.

723
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:44,640
If they just leave us alone,
we'll make a farm out of this yet.

724
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:47,400
Somebody's coming, Pa.

725
01:15:50,680 --> 01:15:53,880
- Looks like Shipstead.
- It's Mr Shipstead.

726
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:56,640
Starrett!

727
01:15:56,840 --> 01:15:59,800
Torrey, he is dead!

728
01:16:01,320 --> 01:16:03,080
Torrey?

729
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:06,960
Torrey, he is dead!

730
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:13,800
The new man shot him,
the new man that works for Ryker did it.

731
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:21,760
I was across the street,
I heard anger in the voices.

732
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:24,720
The two of them reach for pistols,

733
01:16:24,920 --> 01:16:28,440
but the new man is quick, terribly quick.

734
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:33,120
One shot, Torrey dead.

735
01:16:33,320 --> 01:16:36,400
- One shot.
- What happened?

736
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:41,480
We go to town together.
He say it be safe.

737
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:44,960
It was all quiet. We separate.

738
01:16:45,160 --> 01:16:50,360
Then the anger in the voices, I hear.
Only the anger, not the words.

739
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:53,480
Ryker's men were all around.

740
01:16:53,680 --> 01:16:55,280
What started it?

741
01:16:55,480 --> 01:17:01,040
I passed Lewis, his missus and Johnson.
They're scared.

742
01:17:01,240 --> 01:17:04,600
- Who saw it?
- Just the Ryker men and me.

743
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:10,280
Morgan say they wait for any more
who come looking for trouble.

744
01:17:10,480 --> 01:17:14,640
Marian, you get ready.
Mrs Torrey will need you.

745
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:18,800
Shane, hitch up the team.

746
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,200
What are you going to do, Joe?

747
01:17:21,400 --> 01:17:25,320
- Go to town. I'm gonna see about this.
- You can't go alone.

748
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:29,040
- Marian, I'm going.
- She's right, Joe.

749
01:17:29,240 --> 01:17:35,120
But the others are all in this,
it's not just you. Wait for them.

750
01:17:35,320 --> 01:17:42,240
- Sooner or later, someone's got to go.
- But not now. Don't you go alone!

751
01:17:42,440 --> 01:17:48,000
The other homesteaders, I think
they run. I think they get out of here.

752
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:55,240
Here comes Joe Starrett.
Wish he'd tend to his own business.

753
01:17:58,920 --> 01:18:04,120
- What goes on?
- We're going on. I've had enough.

754
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:06,800
I sure figured you for a better man.

755
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:11,040
You saw what's happened.
Torrey's dead.

756
01:18:11,240 --> 01:18:14,200
Just gonna pile up your plunder and skip.

757
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:17,680
Too scared to see Torrey
get a decent funeral.

758
01:18:17,880 --> 01:18:20,680
I don't want him killed. We're going.

759
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:24,240
It ain't a question
of who stays or who runs.

760
01:18:24,440 --> 01:18:28,400
We gotta see Stonewall
get a Christian burial,

761
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:32,360
and his wife hear some words of comfort
said over her man.

762
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:34,680
We'll make sure it's done.

763
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:38,920
Torrey's already dead.
I don't want it to happen to my man.

764
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:44,880
Fred, if you ain't at that funeral,
I'll sure take it bad of you.

765
01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:50,320
Well... cemetery hill's
on the way out, Martha...

766
01:19:36,680 --> 01:19:42,120
Shipstead, would you please
lead us in the Lord's Prayer?

767
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:49,760
Our Father who art in heaven,
hallowed be Thy name.

768
01:19:49,960 --> 01:19:56,120
Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done
on earth, as it is in heaven.

769
01:19:56,320 --> 01:19:59,080
Give us this day our daily bread,

770
01:19:59,280 --> 01:20:05,080
and forgive us our trespasses as we
forgive those who trespass against us.

771
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:10,440
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

772
01:20:10,640 --> 01:20:13,880
For Thine is the kingdom,
and the power,

773
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:17,240
and the glory, for ever. Amen.

774
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:10,120
He's gonna bite you!

775
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:53,280
Goodbye, Mrs Starrett, we're going.

776
01:22:53,480 --> 01:22:58,960
Goodbye, Joe. Goodbye, Axel.
Goodbye, John.

777
01:22:59,160 --> 01:23:02,000
Sue, you put the kids in the wagon.

778
01:23:02,200 --> 01:23:05,400
Wait for me, Lewis.
I'm coming with you.

779
01:23:06,600 --> 01:23:11,480
Wait a minute, let's not be in a hurry.
There's one more thing.

780
01:23:11,680 --> 01:23:15,280
Torrey was a pretty brave man.

781
01:23:15,480 --> 01:23:19,520
We'd be doing wrong
if we wasn't the same.

782
01:23:19,720 --> 01:23:22,760
Last time you argued that,
Torrey was alive.

783
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:28,120
- You want us to stay for more of this?
- We can have a regular settlement.

784
01:23:28,320 --> 01:23:32,000
We can have a town,
and churches and a school...

785
01:23:32,200 --> 01:23:34,760
Graveyards...

786
01:23:37,160 --> 01:23:40,120
You've just got to, that's all.

787
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:45,440
He wants you to stay for something
that means more than anything.

788
01:23:45,640 --> 01:23:47,360
Your families.

789
01:23:47,560 --> 01:23:50,240
Your wives and kids.

790
01:23:50,440 --> 01:23:53,880
Like you, Lewis, your girls...

791
01:23:54,080 --> 01:23:57,360
...and Shipstead with his boys.

792
01:23:57,560 --> 01:24:01,640
They've got a right to stay here
and grow up and be happy.

793
01:24:01,840 --> 01:24:06,920
It's up to you people
to have nerve enough to not give it up.

794
01:24:07,120 --> 01:24:13,600
That's right. We can't give up this valley
and we ain't gonna do it.

795
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:19,720
This is farming country, a place
for people to bring up their families.

796
01:24:21,160 --> 01:24:25,040
Who's Ryker to run us
away from our own homes?

797
01:24:25,240 --> 01:24:29,080
He only wants to grow beef,
and we want to grow families,

798
01:24:29,280 --> 01:24:33,680
to grow them good and strong,
the way they were meant to be grown.

799
01:24:33,880 --> 01:24:37,880
God didn't make all this country
just for one man like Ryker.

800
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:41,280
He's got it though,
and that's what counts.

801
01:24:41,480 --> 01:24:43,920
- Look, look there.
- A fire!

802
01:24:44,120 --> 01:24:47,080
It's Lewis's place.

803
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:52,960
It's our place.

804
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:57,320
- Ryker lit it.
- He had no right.

805
01:24:57,520 --> 01:25:00,320
He wouldn't have, if you hadn't left it.

806
01:25:00,520 --> 01:25:03,080
I built it with my own hands.

807
01:25:03,280 --> 01:25:06,360
- Not the girls' room.
- I was getting round to it.

808
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:10,040
If we stick together,
we can put that place back up.

809
01:25:10,240 --> 01:25:12,160
- Can't we?
- Right.

810
01:25:12,360 --> 01:25:15,960
We'll help you build the room,
Johnson and Joe.

811
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:18,560
- Shane'll help.
- Yeah.

812
01:25:18,760 --> 01:25:23,240
We'll get the timber
and put it right back up, right?

813
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:26,480
- Yes, sir! We'll do it.
- Me, too, I'll help.

814
01:25:26,680 --> 01:25:30,080
- You'll do that for us?
- All that, just for us?

815
01:25:30,280 --> 01:25:34,920
Not just for you, Martha,
for all of us in this valley.

816
01:25:35,120 --> 01:25:38,160
Come and help.
Maybe we can save part of that.

817
01:25:38,360 --> 01:25:44,080
- That's the spirit.
- Let's get to the Lewises' place.

818
01:25:45,880 --> 01:25:48,520
Come on, men!

819
01:25:54,840 --> 01:25:58,560
Boss! Looks like Lewis is going back.

820
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:07,120
Starrett's holding 'em together.

821
01:26:07,320 --> 01:26:10,920
- He could set fire to mine.
- Stay on your ground.

822
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:13,560
He'll do us like he did Torrey.

823
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:18,440
- There's a law against killing.
- The law is three days' ride from here.

824
01:26:18,640 --> 01:26:22,000
- You know that.
- What does that leave us with?

825
01:26:22,200 --> 01:26:25,800
- Give me time.
- Who's gonna fight Ryker?

826
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:29,720
- He knows he's got us on the run.
- You men hang on...

827
01:26:29,920 --> 01:26:33,600
- Hang on?
- I promise something's gonna be done.

828
01:26:33,800 --> 01:26:36,160
But what, Joe?

829
01:26:36,360 --> 01:26:39,560
Leave that to me.
I'll have it out with Ryker.

830
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:44,480
- You're taking on too much.
- If I have to kill him.

831
01:26:46,160 --> 01:26:50,880
That's wrong. Don't even think that.

832
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:10,640
Starrett's got to go.

833
01:27:10,840 --> 01:27:15,440
I've warned him twice, but he's
pig-headed. He'll have to pay for it.

834
01:27:32,240 --> 01:27:34,800
Joe, you can't do it!

835
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:39,800
If the Lewises have the courage
to start over, I won't let them down.

836
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:45,680
But you can't go in town
to kill Ryker. He'll kill you.

837
01:27:46,920 --> 01:27:51,360
Tell him I'm a reasonable man,
things have gone far enough.

838
01:27:51,560 --> 01:27:55,240
Tell him I'm beat, anything,
but, by Jupiter, get him here!

839
01:27:55,440 --> 01:27:59,240
He'll come.
He thinks he's a reasonable man.

840
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:01,840
Hello, Calloway.

841
01:28:11,840 --> 01:28:14,880
- He'll kill you.
- It's a chance I gotta take.

842
01:28:15,080 --> 01:28:19,320
This is a false square knot, Joey,
it won't hold.

843
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:24,720
Shane! Tell him he can't go.
Tell him it won't work. Tell him!

844
01:28:24,920 --> 01:28:27,440
Shane!

845
01:28:27,640 --> 01:28:32,440
Wait, Joe, till things cool off.
Wait that long, anyway.

846
01:28:32,640 --> 01:28:35,160
That's right, isn't it, Shane?

847
01:28:36,200 --> 01:28:39,720
I can't tell Joe what's right, Marian.

848
01:29:10,560 --> 01:29:13,320
Please wait, Joe.

849
01:29:14,360 --> 01:29:17,760
Won't you do even this for me?

850
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:42,600
Starrett?

851
01:29:44,040 --> 01:29:45,800
Mr Starrett!

852
01:30:09,320 --> 01:30:13,360
- Who is it?
- Peace party, from Ryker.

853
01:30:16,280 --> 01:30:19,640
One of you can come across and talk.

854
01:30:29,960 --> 01:30:33,920
- Stay out of that garden.
- We ain't armed.

855
01:30:41,040 --> 01:30:44,040
Brother Rufe wants to see you.

856
01:30:46,120 --> 01:30:49,280
He says to tell you
he's a reasonable man.

857
01:30:49,480 --> 01:30:52,320
He's responsible for Torrey's killing.

858
01:30:52,520 --> 01:30:56,880
My brother wouldn't kill anybody.
He don't wanna go to jail.

859
01:30:57,080 --> 01:31:00,120
Torrey was a hot-head,
he picked on a stranger.

860
01:31:00,320 --> 01:31:05,880
Torrey didn't wanna be reasonable.
You wanna be reasonable, don't you?

861
01:31:06,080 --> 01:31:08,520
I always figured on being reasonable.

862
01:31:08,720 --> 01:31:13,000
My brother's waiting.
He'll see you at Grafton's.

863
01:31:13,200 --> 01:31:16,080
Who else?

864
01:31:16,280 --> 01:31:20,200
Not us. We're heading home.

865
01:31:23,040 --> 01:31:25,160
I'll see your brother.

866
01:32:09,120 --> 01:32:10,680
Shane!

867
01:32:17,840 --> 01:32:19,600
Shane.

868
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:24,480
- Who is it?
- Calloway. Chris Calloway.

869
01:32:24,680 --> 01:32:30,640
- Stay where you are. I can drill you.
- Hold it, I got something to tell you.

870
01:32:32,960 --> 01:32:37,280
- What do you want?
- Starrett's up against a stacked deck.

871
01:32:37,480 --> 01:32:38,960
Bang! Bang!

872
01:32:39,160 --> 01:32:41,720
Bang! Bang!

873
01:32:43,040 --> 01:32:48,640
- Why are you telling me?
- I reckon something's come over me.

874
01:32:48,840 --> 01:32:52,160
- I don't figure.
- I'm quitting Ryker.

875
01:32:54,080 --> 01:32:57,320
- So long.
- Chris...

876
01:32:58,600 --> 01:33:00,680
Thanks.

877
01:33:02,320 --> 01:33:04,720
Be seeing you.

878
01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:20,880
No use to argue, Marian.
I'm going into this with my eyes open.

879
01:33:21,080 --> 01:33:22,680
No!

880
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:26,520
Isn't there anything I can say
to change things?

881
01:33:26,720 --> 01:33:29,320
Maybe this is a chance.

882
01:33:29,520 --> 01:33:31,760
Morgan and them boys went home...

883
01:33:31,960 --> 01:33:35,320
You don't really believe that,
that's not the reason.

884
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:41,200
It's just too much for me to give up,
this place and our valley...

885
01:33:41,400 --> 01:33:43,960
- All the things that will be.
- Will be!

886
01:33:44,160 --> 01:33:45,800
Bang!

887
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:47,960
Bang, bang, bang!

888
01:33:49,480 --> 01:33:53,560
Joey, don't point that thing!
Go play outside.

889
01:33:53,760 --> 01:33:56,640
Play outside, Joey!

890
01:34:00,240 --> 01:34:03,040
Please, dear. Go outside and play.

891
01:34:06,960 --> 01:34:12,360
It's just pride, that's all,
a silly kind of a pride.

892
01:34:12,560 --> 01:34:17,120
Don't I mean anything to you, Joe?
Doesn't Joey?

893
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:20,920
Marian...

894
01:34:24,200 --> 01:34:30,160
Honey, it's because you mean
so much to me that I've got to go.

895
01:34:31,720 --> 01:34:36,800
Could I go on living with you,
and you thinking I'd showed yellow?

896
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:40,440
And what about Joey?
How would I explain that to him?

897
01:34:40,640 --> 01:34:42,080
Oh, Joe...

898
01:34:43,040 --> 01:34:44,480
Joe!

899
01:34:46,840 --> 01:34:50,160
I've been thinking a lot, and...

900
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:56,320
...I know I'm kinda slow sometimes,
but I see things...

901
01:34:56,520 --> 01:35:02,280
And I know if anything happened to me
that you'd be took care of.

902
01:35:02,480 --> 01:35:07,800
You'd be took care of,
better than I could do it myself.

903
01:35:08,760 --> 01:35:12,680
I never thought I'd live
to hear myself say that, but...

904
01:35:12,880 --> 01:35:17,480
I guess now's a pretty good time
to lay things bare.

905
01:35:17,680 --> 01:35:21,440
You talk as though
I'd be glad for you to go.

906
01:35:21,640 --> 01:35:27,040
Honey, you're the most honest
and the finest girl that ever lived.

907
01:35:27,240 --> 01:35:33,200
I couldn't do what I gotta do if I hadn't
always known I could trust you.

908
01:35:41,680 --> 01:35:44,680
Now, don't you go counting me out!

909
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:50,360
I wouldn't have lived this long
if I wasn't pretty tough.

910
01:36:13,200 --> 01:36:16,640
Pa! Shane's got his gun on.
He's coming!

911
01:36:16,840 --> 01:36:18,600
Gun?

912
01:36:19,800 --> 01:36:25,240
- What's the idea?
- Don't let him go. Don't anybody go!

913
01:36:25,440 --> 01:36:28,480
- This is my kind of game.
- But it ain't yours.

914
01:36:28,680 --> 01:36:33,720
Maybe you're a match for Ryker, maybe
not, but you're no match for Wilson.

915
01:36:33,920 --> 01:36:37,920
Then, I'll outlast him.
But I do appreciate it, Shane.

916
01:36:38,120 --> 01:36:41,960
You're both out of your senses.
This isn't worth a life.

917
01:36:42,200 --> 01:36:46,520
Are you fighting for this shack,
this ground and nothing but work?

918
01:36:46,720 --> 01:36:51,640
I'm sick of it, I'm sick of trouble.
Let's move, let's go on, please!

919
01:36:51,840 --> 01:36:56,200
Marian, don't say that!
You love this place more than me.

920
01:36:56,400 --> 01:36:59,520
- Not any more.
- Even if it's true, it changes nothing.

921
01:36:59,720 --> 01:37:03,440
There must be some way, Shane?
Some way?

922
01:37:05,320 --> 01:37:09,120
- It's no use, Joe.
- No use? What's stopping me?

923
01:37:09,320 --> 01:37:12,480
- I am.
- Get out of my way.

924
01:37:13,480 --> 01:37:18,520
- Am I gonna have to fight you, too?
- That depends on you.

925
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:30,440
Stop!

926
01:37:50,160 --> 01:37:51,920
Stop!

927
01:39:38,840 --> 01:39:43,320
Shane! You hit him with your gun!
I hate you!

928
01:39:50,680 --> 01:39:56,800
- Walk him around when he comes to.
- Joey, bring water and a towel.

929
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,760
Here, Marian. Hide this.

930
01:40:01,280 --> 01:40:03,720
He'll be all right.

931
01:40:03,920 --> 01:40:08,480
No one can blame him
for not keeping that date.

932
01:40:09,480 --> 01:40:12,080
Shane... Wait!

933
01:40:15,280 --> 01:40:20,640
- You were through with gunfighting.
- I changed my mind.

934
01:40:21,640 --> 01:40:24,320
Are you doing this just for me?

935
01:40:24,520 --> 01:40:27,080
For you, Marian...

936
01:40:27,840 --> 01:40:30,400
...and Joe and little Joe.

937
01:40:33,400 --> 01:40:36,520
Then we'll never see you again?

938
01:40:36,720 --> 01:40:39,560
Never's a long time, Marian.

939
01:40:40,600 --> 01:40:44,240
Tell him...
Tell him I was sorry.

940
01:40:44,920 --> 01:40:47,880
No need to tell him that.

941
01:40:49,240 --> 01:40:51,200
Please, Shane...

942
01:40:53,680 --> 01:40:55,640
Mother...

943
01:41:00,200 --> 01:41:02,160
Please...

944
01:41:06,360 --> 01:41:09,320
Take care of yourself.

945
01:41:22,480 --> 01:41:26,040
Mother! Pa's coming along all right.

946
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:30,480
Yes, Joey.

947
01:41:30,680 --> 01:41:34,640
- Why did Shane...?
- Shane did what he had to do.

948
01:41:34,840 --> 01:41:39,200
- You don't hate Shane.
- I know, Mother.

949
01:41:42,480 --> 01:41:44,440
Shane...!

950
01:41:45,640 --> 01:41:48,000
I'm sorry!

951
01:41:49,040 --> 01:41:51,800
He didn't hear you.

952
01:41:59,720 --> 01:42:01,480
Shane!

953
01:42:05,280 --> 01:42:07,960
Shane! I'm sorry!

954
01:46:16,240 --> 01:46:18,560
I came to get your offer, Ryker.

955
01:46:18,760 --> 01:46:22,880
I'm not dealing with you.
Where's Starrett?

956
01:46:23,080 --> 01:46:28,240
- You're dealing with me, Ryker.
- I got no quarrel with you, Shane.

957
01:46:28,440 --> 01:46:31,640
You can walk out now
and no hard feeling.

958
01:46:31,840 --> 01:46:35,760
- What's your offer, Ryker?
- To you, not a thing.

959
01:46:35,960 --> 01:46:39,720
- That's too bad.
- Too bad.

960
01:46:39,920 --> 01:46:44,640
You've lived too long.
Your kind of days are over.

961
01:46:44,840 --> 01:46:49,680
- My days? And yours, gunfighter?
- The difference is I know it.

962
01:46:49,880 --> 01:46:53,520
So we'll turn in our six-guns
to the bartender,

963
01:46:53,720 --> 01:46:57,600
and we'll all start hoeing spuds,
is that it?

964
01:46:57,800 --> 01:47:00,160
Not quite yet.

965
01:47:01,640 --> 01:47:05,120
We haven't heard from your friend here.

966
01:47:12,680 --> 01:47:16,040
I wouldn't push too far if I were you.

967
01:47:37,320 --> 01:47:40,120
Our fight ain't with you.

968
01:47:41,360 --> 01:47:45,960
- It ain't with me, Wilson?
- No, it ain't, Shane.

969
01:47:46,160 --> 01:47:49,400
I wouldn't pull on Wilson, Shane.

970
01:47:49,600 --> 01:47:52,520
Will, you're a witness to this.

971
01:47:53,960 --> 01:47:57,640
So you're Jack Wilson.

972
01:47:57,840 --> 01:48:00,480
What's that mean to you, Shane?

973
01:48:00,680 --> 01:48:03,400
I've heard about you.

974
01:48:05,080 --> 01:48:08,040
What have you heard, Shane?

975
01:48:16,680 --> 01:48:20,400
I've heard that you're
a low-down, Yankee liar.

976
01:48:28,520 --> 01:48:30,280
Prove it!

977
01:48:59,800 --> 01:49:02,160
Shane, look out!

978
01:49:36,440 --> 01:49:38,200
Shane!

979
01:49:39,280 --> 01:49:44,680
I knew you could, Shane.
I knew it just as well as anything.

980
01:49:44,880 --> 01:49:47,960
Was that him? Was that Wilson?

981
01:49:48,160 --> 01:49:52,880
That was him.
That was Wilson, all right.

982
01:49:53,080 --> 01:49:57,080
He was fast, fast on the draw.

983
01:49:57,920 --> 01:50:00,880
Joey, what are you doing here?

984
01:50:02,440 --> 01:50:07,360
- I'm sorry, Shane.
- You don't have to be.

985
01:50:07,560 --> 01:50:12,320
- You'd better run back.
- Can't I ride home behind you?

986
01:50:13,800 --> 01:50:16,240
I'm afraid not, Joey.

987
01:50:16,440 --> 01:50:19,440
Please! Why not?

988
01:50:20,600 --> 01:50:23,560
I gotta be going on.

989
01:50:24,640 --> 01:50:27,400
Why, Shane?

990
01:50:28,480 --> 01:50:34,080
A man has to be what he is, Joey.
Can't break the mould.

991
01:50:34,840 --> 01:50:40,040
- I tried it and it didn't work for me.
- We want you, Shane.

992
01:50:41,680 --> 01:50:47,640
Joey, there's no living with a killing.
There's no going back from one.

993
01:50:47,840 --> 01:50:51,520
Right or wrong, it's a brand.
A brand sticks.

994
01:50:53,440 --> 01:50:55,960
There's no going back.

995
01:50:56,160 --> 01:50:59,600
Now you run on home to your mother,
and tell her...

996
01:50:59,800 --> 01:51:05,480
...tell her everything's all right and
there aren't any more guns in the valley.

997
01:51:05,680 --> 01:51:07,360
Shane...

998
01:51:08,360 --> 01:51:11,520
It's bloody! You're hurt!

999
01:51:14,800 --> 01:51:17,560
I'm all right, Joey.

1000
01:51:17,760 --> 01:51:24,320
Go home to your mother and father
and grow up to be strong and straight.

1001
01:51:26,680 --> 01:51:28,600
And, Joey...

1002
01:51:28,800 --> 01:51:33,000
Take care of them, both of them.

1003
01:51:37,600 --> 01:51:39,360
Yes, Shane.

1004
01:51:50,280 --> 01:51:54,480
He'd never have shot you
if you'd seen him!

1005
01:51:54,680 --> 01:51:56,480
Bye, little Joe.

1006
01:51:59,960 --> 01:52:04,320
He'd never even have cleared
the holster, would he, Shane?

1007
01:52:13,320 --> 01:52:19,720
Pa's got things for you to do!
And Mother wants you!

1008
01:52:19,920 --> 01:52:22,280
I know she does!

1009
01:52:23,440 --> 01:52:25,000
Shane!

1010
01:52:32,680 --> 01:52:34,640
Shane!

1011
01:52:36,280 --> 01:52:38,280
Come back!
