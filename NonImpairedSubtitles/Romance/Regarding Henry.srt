1
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,192
Folks, we've been here
for a long time now,

2
00:02:14,236 --> 00:02:18,798
listening to people talk
for months.

3
00:02:18,841 --> 00:02:21,742
Complicated medical testimony.

4
00:02:24,513 --> 00:02:28,313
A lot of emotion in this case.

5
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:31,513
There is not a person
in this room who isn't sorry

6
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:34,248
about what happened
to Mr. Matthews.

7
00:02:34,289 --> 00:02:39,158
It's a tragedy.

8
00:02:39,194 --> 00:02:41,321
And when something
like this happens,

9
00:02:41,363 --> 00:02:44,264
you desperately want
to blame someone, don't you?

10
00:02:44,299 --> 00:02:46,529
Someone else.

11
00:02:46,568 --> 00:02:49,765
We understand that.
It's natural.

12
00:02:52,608 --> 00:02:56,510
But what have we got here?
What's the bottom line?

13
00:02:56,545 --> 00:02:59,036
It's Mr. Matthews' word

14
00:02:59,081 --> 00:03:03,643
against the East Shore Hospital,
isn't it?

15
00:03:03,685 --> 00:03:07,052
That's exactly what it is.

16
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:11,750
Now, obviously,
any decent human being

17
00:03:11,794 --> 00:03:14,661
would want to believe
Mr. Matthews...

18
00:03:14,696 --> 00:03:18,132
believe that he told the
admitting nurse, Mrs. Valdez

19
00:03:18,167 --> 00:03:20,294
that he was diabetic.

20
00:03:20,335 --> 00:03:24,829
It would seem... poetic
that someone else was to blame.

21
00:03:24,873 --> 00:03:26,966
It would feel right.

22
00:03:27,009 --> 00:03:30,911
But it wouldn't be fair.

23
00:03:30,946 --> 00:03:32,277
Let's-let's think for a second.

24
00:03:32,314 --> 00:03:34,441
Who's being blamed here?

25
00:03:34,483 --> 00:03:38,385
It's not some, some big bad
hospital corporation.

26
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:41,912
We're talking
about human beings.

27
00:03:41,957 --> 00:03:43,447
Four doctors, five nurses,

28
00:03:43,492 --> 00:03:47,019
the hospital chief of staff
present at the time.

29
00:03:47,062 --> 00:03:49,929
All of them there
for no other purpose

30
00:03:49,965 --> 00:03:54,368
than to try and save
Jonathan Matthews' life.

31
00:03:54,403 --> 00:03:57,133
Now, this is painful,
and I don't like doing this,

32
00:03:57,172 --> 00:03:59,333
but if we're all going to do
our jobs,

33
00:03:59,374 --> 00:04:01,171
I've got to bring this up again.

34
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:03,770
Mr. Matthews is an alcoholic.

35
00:04:03,812 --> 00:04:07,339
In July of 1979,
he tried to commit suicide.

36
00:04:07,382 --> 00:04:09,577
And, you know, even I was
surprised to learn

37
00:04:09,618 --> 00:04:14,317
from the plaintiff's
own doctors, ironically,

38
00:04:14,356 --> 00:04:16,483
that this tragedy
could have been caused

39
00:04:16,558 --> 00:04:17,923
by the abuse of alcohol.

40
00:04:19,962 --> 00:04:23,056
So here's my point:

41
00:04:23,098 --> 00:04:25,589
We all understand why

42
00:04:25,634 --> 00:04:29,968
Mr. Matthews is blaming
the hospital...

43
00:04:30,005 --> 00:04:34,339
but nobody could have prevented
Mr. Mathews' suffering

44
00:04:34,376 --> 00:04:36,901
except Mr. Matthews.

45
00:04:42,284 --> 00:04:43,808
Listen to me.

46
00:04:43,852 --> 00:04:45,217
Listen to me.

47
00:04:45,254 --> 00:04:49,350
The table you delivered is
not the table I ordered.

48
00:04:49,391 --> 00:04:51,655
I'm-I'm having a party
on Friday,

49
00:04:51,693 --> 00:04:53,524
and the table sitting
in my dining room

50
00:04:53,562 --> 00:04:56,656
Iooks like a goddamned turtle.

51
00:05:09,311 --> 00:05:12,178
We find for the defendant
on all counts.

52
00:05:17,019 --> 00:05:19,249
Henry, that was great.

53
00:05:20,956 --> 00:05:22,287
Bruce.

54
00:05:30,232 --> 00:05:32,700
See you back at the office.

55
00:05:38,307 --> 00:05:40,605
Mr. Matthews, everyone.

56
00:05:40,642 --> 00:05:42,269
Bottoms up.

57
00:05:45,747 --> 00:05:46,714
Mr. Cameron?

58
00:05:46,748 --> 00:05:48,010
Hi, thanks.

59
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:49,142
Mm-hmm.

60
00:05:49,184 --> 00:05:51,948
Like father, like son.

61
00:05:51,987 --> 00:05:54,080
Yeah, the old bastard
would have loved this one, huh?

62
00:05:54,122 --> 00:05:55,589
Only if he'd pulled it off.

63
00:06:00,329 --> 00:06:02,297
Mr. Turner.

64
00:06:02,331 --> 00:06:03,730
If Maxwell calls,

65
00:06:03,765 --> 00:06:05,960
tell him we won East Shore,
and he owes me 50.

66
00:06:06,001 --> 00:06:07,298
Mm-hmm.

67
00:06:07,336 --> 00:06:08,564
Don't give me this now.

68
00:06:08,603 --> 00:06:09,865
Cancel my lunch tomorrow.

69
00:06:09,905 --> 00:06:11,202
I'm going to work through,

70
00:06:11,239 --> 00:06:12,968
and move the dinner
to next week.

71
00:06:13,008 --> 00:06:15,135
Go ahead and pull the file
on Briggs v. Gordon.

72
00:06:15,177 --> 00:06:16,906
Oh, what about
the Rosenberg brunch...

73
00:06:16,945 --> 00:06:17,912
May I finish, please?

74
00:06:17,946 --> 00:06:19,914
I need that Martinson deposition
on my desk

75
00:06:19,948 --> 00:06:21,074
by 9:00 tomorrow morning.

76
00:06:21,116 --> 00:06:22,083
Mm-hmm.

77
00:06:22,117 --> 00:06:23,641
Hmm, and call my wife

78
00:06:23,685 --> 00:06:26,654
and tell her I can't make dinner
at 7:30.

79
00:06:26,688 --> 00:06:27,916
Mm-hmm.

80
00:06:27,956 --> 00:06:30,288
Tell her to call the Who'sits
and make it 8:30 instead.

81
00:06:30,325 --> 00:06:31,758
Yes, sir.

82
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:35,159
Because you're responsible.

83
00:06:35,197 --> 00:06:36,164
And if you can't learn

84
00:06:36,198 --> 00:06:37,665
to respect
other people's things,

85
00:06:37,699 --> 00:06:39,462
then we're going to have
a big problem.

86
00:06:40,869 --> 00:06:42,803
Now, you're not to leave
this room tonight.

87
00:06:42,838 --> 00:06:44,533
You understand?

88
00:06:49,244 --> 00:06:51,838
The sooner we get there,
the sooner we can leave.

89
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,040
-You ready?
-Mm-hmm.

90
00:06:53,081 --> 00:06:55,675
Rosella, we're going now.

91
00:06:55,717 --> 00:06:57,048
Good night, missus.

92
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:06,688
Keys?

93
00:07:07,996 --> 00:07:09,520
Got 'em.

94
00:07:10,599 --> 00:07:11,566
I can't.

95
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,795
Next week, all of our relatives
are coming in.

96
00:07:15,404 --> 00:07:16,769
George, you should get a boat.

97
00:07:16,805 --> 00:07:19,069
Oh, oh, and just send
them away, huh? I like that.

98
00:07:19,107 --> 00:07:20,938
Last year when
Sarah's relatives came in,

99
00:07:20,976 --> 00:07:22,068
we chartered this boat...

100
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:23,236
Oh, God, the boat, the boat.

101
00:07:23,278 --> 00:07:24,643
You take them out.
You feed them.

102
00:07:24,679 --> 00:07:26,203
They stare at the
Statue of Liberty.

103
00:07:26,248 --> 00:07:27,715
Everybody's happy
and nobody talks.

104
00:07:27,749 --> 00:07:28,716
They don't even realize

105
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,149
they're not having
a conversation.

106
00:07:31,553 --> 00:07:33,646
The only reason I came
was because it said "two."

107
00:07:33,688 --> 00:07:34,882
In the paper, two fireplaces.

108
00:07:34,923 --> 00:07:36,220
Right. So finally, I get there,

109
00:07:36,258 --> 00:07:37,782
and she says,
"Oh, no, that's wrong,

110
00:07:37,826 --> 00:07:39,123
but it's got two fire escapes."

111
00:07:42,064 --> 00:07:43,361
Juliette?

112
00:07:43,398 --> 00:07:44,365
Julia.

113
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:45,627
Julia.

114
00:07:45,667 --> 00:07:48,727
George, you and Julia
really must come

115
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:50,670
to our Christmas party.

116
00:07:50,705 --> 00:07:52,366
Come on now,
Sarah's got a recipe

117
00:07:52,407 --> 00:07:53,374
for trifle you'd kill for.

118
00:07:53,408 --> 00:07:55,501
You must come.
We've chartered a boat.

119
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:57,942
Oh, come on!

120
00:08:07,923 --> 00:08:09,288
Good evening, Mrs. Turner.

121
00:08:09,324 --> 00:08:10,291
Hi, Eddie.

122
00:08:10,325 --> 00:08:11,917
Good evening, Mr. Turner.

123
00:08:27,409 --> 00:08:29,274
Goddamn it.

124
00:08:29,311 --> 00:08:32,212
You should apologize to Rachel.

125
00:08:32,247 --> 00:08:34,408
I don't want you dealing
with Tracy anymore.

126
00:08:34,449 --> 00:08:37,145
If she doesn't replace this
table tomorrow, that's it.

127
00:08:37,185 --> 00:08:39,346
Henry...

128
00:08:39,387 --> 00:08:41,082
go tell Rachel you're sorry.

129
00:08:41,123 --> 00:08:42,420
You never apologized.

130
00:08:42,457 --> 00:08:45,255
Did you tell the caterer
we're 60 now?

131
00:08:52,634 --> 00:08:54,829
Okay.

132
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:10,641
Hi.

133
00:09:20,829 --> 00:09:24,094
I was angry.

134
00:09:24,132 --> 00:09:26,999
I admit I was angry.

135
00:09:27,035 --> 00:09:28,002
But...

136
00:09:28,036 --> 00:09:31,096
with a reason.

137
00:09:31,139 --> 00:09:34,438
My piano is
very important to me.

138
00:09:34,476 --> 00:09:38,412
It's like your doll.

139
00:09:38,446 --> 00:09:39,640
Frank's your baby.

140
00:09:39,681 --> 00:09:41,979
How would you react
if I spilled grape juice

141
00:09:42,017 --> 00:09:43,041
all over your baby?

142
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:47,045
His name isn't Frank.

143
00:09:47,088 --> 00:09:52,924
Rachel, the point is,
if you can't be responsible,

144
00:09:52,961 --> 00:09:55,054
don't take food
out of the kitchen.

145
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:02,165
Finished a real big case today,
honey.

146
00:10:02,204 --> 00:10:04,866
And Daddy won.

147
00:10:06,341 --> 00:10:08,332
Okay?

148
00:10:08,376 --> 00:10:09,809
All better?

149
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:16,208
Qui tacet consentire videtur.

150
00:10:17,352 --> 00:10:21,948
He who is silent is understood
to consent.

151
00:10:37,038 --> 00:10:39,404
I told Rosella to get
some cigarettes.

152
00:10:39,441 --> 00:10:41,534
Goddamn it.

153
00:10:41,576 --> 00:10:45,945
Frances said Carol's daughter
wasn't accepted at Huntington.

154
00:10:45,981 --> 00:10:47,915
They're all dying Rachel got in.

155
00:10:49,851 --> 00:10:51,978
Carol's daughter's
a virtual idiot.

156
00:11:05,767 --> 00:11:07,064
I'm gonna go get some.

157
00:11:07,102 --> 00:11:09,229
I'll be right back.

158
00:11:09,271 --> 00:11:10,636
Don't forget your keys.

159
00:11:36,197 --> 00:11:37,562
Pack of Merits.

160
00:11:39,734 --> 00:11:40,962
Pack of Merits.

161
00:11:41,002 --> 00:11:42,367
Cigarettes.

162
00:11:45,173 --> 00:11:47,937
Look, any time tonight
would be okay.

163
00:11:50,378 --> 00:11:52,107
What a fucking day.

164
00:11:52,147 --> 00:11:53,341
Come on.
Give me your wallet.

165
00:11:53,381 --> 00:11:54,348
Give me a break, will you?

166
00:11:54,382 --> 00:11:55,610
I just want
a pack of cigarettes.

167
00:12:00,889 --> 00:12:03,858
All right, wait a second,
wait a second.

168
00:12:06,461 --> 00:12:08,861
All right, wait a minute.

169
00:12:08,897 --> 00:12:10,865
Will-will you just wait
a minute?

170
00:12:26,214 --> 00:12:28,079
I know.
I got to go.

171
00:12:29,851 --> 00:12:33,412
Okay. Good night.

172
00:12:34,723 --> 00:12:37,590
You should glue the keys
to your hand, Henry.

173
00:12:40,562 --> 00:12:42,325
What, what is it?

174
00:13:01,449 --> 00:13:02,882
Excuse us. Excuse us.

175
00:13:02,917 --> 00:13:04,077
Hello?

176
00:13:04,119 --> 00:13:06,383
This is Mrs. Turner.
Henry Turner.

177
00:13:10,158 --> 00:13:12,126
Mrs. Turner?

178
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,151
Mrs. Turner?

179
00:13:14,195 --> 00:13:16,186
Nurse.

180
00:13:36,184 --> 00:13:37,151
So he's driving,

181
00:13:37,185 --> 00:13:38,846
he just went off
the side of the road.

182
00:13:38,887 --> 00:13:42,015
Doctors say forget it...
no chance.

183
00:13:42,056 --> 00:13:44,354
Three months later,
he beat me in tennis.

184
00:13:44,392 --> 00:13:45,859
I swear to God.

185
00:13:45,894 --> 00:13:46,861
You never know.

186
00:13:46,895 --> 00:13:48,556
I mean, you never know.

187
00:13:51,065 --> 00:13:52,532
Sarah.

188
00:13:52,567 --> 00:13:54,194
Sarah, darling.

189
00:13:54,235 --> 00:13:56,203
We're here.

190
00:13:56,237 --> 00:13:58,137
We're here.

191
00:14:05,013 --> 00:14:09,473
What did the neurologist say
is going to happen to Dad?

192
00:14:09,517 --> 00:14:12,680
He said he didn't know.

193
00:14:29,537 --> 00:14:31,505
Rachel says "Hi."

194
00:14:31,539 --> 00:14:33,166
So does everyone.

195
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:36,871
The phone hasn't stopped
ringing all week.

196
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:41,041
Rosella keeps rewashing
your shirts

197
00:14:41,082 --> 00:14:42,344
so she has something to do.

198
00:14:42,383 --> 00:14:46,513
She's... she's being great,
just wonderful.

199
00:14:46,554 --> 00:14:49,022
My mother says "Hi."

200
00:14:49,057 --> 00:14:50,922
She wanted to fly in.

201
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:53,860
You know, always trying to help.

202
00:14:53,895 --> 00:14:57,194
She asked what she could
possibly do.

203
00:14:57,232 --> 00:15:00,895
I said, "Don't come."

204
00:15:03,171 --> 00:15:05,162
Rachel got her school uniform.

205
00:15:05,206 --> 00:15:07,640
It's-it's
the most adorable thing.

206
00:15:07,675 --> 00:15:09,973
She put it on and she said,

207
00:15:10,011 --> 00:15:14,277
"Mom, I don't feel smart."

208
00:15:24,359 --> 00:15:26,327
Henry...

209
00:15:26,361 --> 00:15:29,524
I know you can hear me.

210
00:15:33,334 --> 00:15:35,029
Okay, you can open one present.

211
00:15:35,069 --> 00:15:36,832
We'll do the rest
in the morning.

212
00:15:36,871 --> 00:15:38,168
Okay, I'll tell him.

213
00:15:38,206 --> 00:15:39,332
You go to sleep now.

214
00:15:39,374 --> 00:15:42,002
I'll be home soon
to tuck you in.

215
00:15:42,043 --> 00:15:43,510
Okay.

216
00:15:43,545 --> 00:15:44,842
I love you.

217
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:46,141
Goodnight, sweetheart.

218
00:15:51,219 --> 00:15:54,552
Well, I'm going home now.

219
00:15:56,724 --> 00:15:58,715
Goodnight, sweetheart.

220
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,491
I'll see you tomorrow.

221
00:16:10,171 --> 00:16:11,138
Goodnight, Claudia.

222
00:16:11,172 --> 00:16:12,639
Goodnight, Sarah.

223
00:16:12,674 --> 00:16:14,835
Merry Christmas.

224
00:16:33,027 --> 00:16:35,325
Oh, my goodness.

225
00:16:35,363 --> 00:16:37,263
Look who's awake.

226
00:16:37,298 --> 00:16:39,858
Hello, honey.

227
00:16:39,901 --> 00:16:41,596
Let me go and call your doctor.

228
00:16:48,075 --> 00:16:49,542
Hi.

229
00:16:57,218 --> 00:16:59,550
Hi.

230
00:17:05,226 --> 00:17:07,820
Hi, darling.

231
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:11,162
Hi, darling.

232
00:17:19,707 --> 00:17:21,470
Mrs. Turner,

233
00:17:21,509 --> 00:17:24,808
your-your husband's
incredibly lucky.

234
00:17:24,846 --> 00:17:29,476
The bullet wound to the head
caused minimal damage.

235
00:17:29,517 --> 00:17:32,816
See, it... it hit
the right frontal lobe.

236
00:17:32,854 --> 00:17:34,685
That's the only part
of the brain

237
00:17:34,722 --> 00:17:36,314
that has redundant systems.

238
00:17:36,357 --> 00:17:39,121
I mean, if you're going
to get shot in the head,

239
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,128
that's... that's
the way to do it.

240
00:17:43,364 --> 00:17:46,663
But... l, uh, I...

241
00:17:46,701 --> 00:17:48,168
can't lie to you,

242
00:17:48,202 --> 00:17:50,830
I wish I had all good news.

243
00:17:50,872 --> 00:17:57,175
The other bullet... hit
the subclavian artery.

244
00:17:57,211 --> 00:17:59,338
There was excessive
internal bleeding

245
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:02,144
and cardiac arrest.

246
00:18:02,183 --> 00:18:04,708
Your husband suffered anoxia.

247
00:18:04,752 --> 00:18:07,778
It's a lack of oxygen
to the brain.

248
00:18:07,822 --> 00:18:11,485
And the anoxia caused
some damage.

249
00:18:13,528 --> 00:18:17,294
What I'm getting at...

250
00:18:17,331 --> 00:18:20,164
is that it's going
to be a long,

251
00:18:20,201 --> 00:18:22,135
tough rehabilitation.

252
00:18:22,169 --> 00:18:24,831
How long?

253
00:18:24,872 --> 00:18:27,932
We'll know a lot more
in three months.

254
00:18:27,975 --> 00:18:29,875
The brain is very mysterious.

255
00:18:29,911 --> 00:18:32,471
Even though your husband
seems to have

256
00:18:32,513 --> 00:18:35,482
the capacity to recover,
there's no telling

257
00:18:35,516 --> 00:18:39,475
how well or how long
it might take.

258
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,953
In some ways,

259
00:18:40,988 --> 00:18:44,480
he's starting
from scratch here.

260
00:18:46,527 --> 00:18:49,325
Mrs. Turner...

261
00:18:49,363 --> 00:18:52,332
Henry can't speak.

262
00:18:52,366 --> 00:18:53,833
He can't move.

263
00:18:53,868 --> 00:18:56,496
His motor skills aren't
functioning properly.

264
00:18:56,537 --> 00:18:59,665
His memory might be
deeply affected.

265
00:18:59,707 --> 00:19:03,268
Certainly, one day,
everything might come back,

266
00:19:03,311 --> 00:19:06,109
but there are no guarantees.

267
00:19:07,148 --> 00:19:11,107
He might not be able
to regain his speech

268
00:19:11,152 --> 00:19:13,620
or physical coordination.

269
00:19:13,654 --> 00:19:16,555
Ever.

270
00:19:22,163 --> 00:19:24,996
So, how's Dad?

271
00:19:26,167 --> 00:19:29,330
He's doing great, sweetheart.

272
00:19:30,671 --> 00:19:32,969
The rehabilitation clinic's
going to be

273
00:19:33,007 --> 00:19:34,804
much better than the hospital.

274
00:19:34,842 --> 00:19:37,868
He wants to get better
before you see him.

275
00:19:44,685 --> 00:19:47,347
Can we get a puppy?

276
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:52,023
Maybe we will, honey.

277
00:20:10,811 --> 00:20:13,507
Charlie called yesterday.

278
00:20:13,547 --> 00:20:16,175
He says this is
a really great place.

279
00:20:16,217 --> 00:20:18,845
Everybody knows
about this place.

280
00:20:18,886 --> 00:20:22,515
But he can't wait to throw you
a welcome back party.

281
00:20:22,556 --> 00:20:24,285
And for the 500th time,

282
00:20:24,325 --> 00:20:27,089
he wants me to tell you
not to worry,

283
00:20:27,128 --> 00:20:29,187
everything's under control.

284
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:34,167
Just take your time,
but get back immediately.

285
00:20:37,405 --> 00:20:39,339
It's so pretty here, isn't it?

286
00:20:41,909 --> 00:20:43,035
Hello.

287
00:20:43,077 --> 00:20:44,374
-Mrs. Turner?
-Yes.

288
00:20:44,412 --> 00:20:46,209
I'm Dr. Marx, Chief of Staff.

289
00:20:46,247 --> 00:20:47,214
Hi.

290
00:20:47,248 --> 00:20:48,442
Hi, Henry.

291
00:20:48,482 --> 00:20:50,541
How's everything going so far?

292
00:20:50,584 --> 00:20:52,552
'Cause I'm the boss around here.

293
00:20:52,586 --> 00:20:55,453
If you have any problems,
you complain to me.

294
00:20:55,489 --> 00:20:57,548
What a beautiful little girl.

295
00:20:57,591 --> 00:20:59,058
Yeah, that's Rachel.

296
00:20:59,093 --> 00:21:00,390
How old is she?

297
00:21:00,428 --> 00:21:02,020
She's going to be 12.

298
00:21:02,063 --> 00:21:04,293
This your little girl, Henry?

299
00:21:05,332 --> 00:21:08,529
Is this your daughter?

300
00:21:09,537 --> 00:21:12,870
Do you remember your daughter?

301
00:21:16,711 --> 00:21:19,271
Do you remember your wife?

302
00:21:23,851 --> 00:21:27,014
Henry?

303
00:21:27,054 --> 00:21:29,488
Do you know who this is, Henry?

304
00:21:50,244 --> 00:21:51,871
What do you think?

305
00:21:52,913 --> 00:21:54,540
Oh...

306
00:21:54,582 --> 00:21:56,174
Look at you.

307
00:21:57,585 --> 00:21:59,553
Brings out your beautiful eyes.

308
00:21:59,587 --> 00:22:01,077
Come here, look.

309
00:22:03,023 --> 00:22:05,150
See?

310
00:22:05,192 --> 00:22:06,352
Now, the secret is

311
00:22:06,393 --> 00:22:08,987
is to send the thank you note
right away

312
00:22:09,029 --> 00:22:11,293
before a month goes by,
and Aunt Maggie thinks

313
00:22:11,332 --> 00:22:13,129
you've forgotten
all about her, okay?

314
00:22:20,207 --> 00:22:24,007
Are we going to be poor now?

315
00:22:24,044 --> 00:22:25,602
What?

316
00:22:28,215 --> 00:22:30,843
Jennifer Lerner said
that her mother said

317
00:22:30,885 --> 00:22:34,685
that with Dad in the hospital,
and the way we spend money,

318
00:22:34,722 --> 00:22:38,852
that we're going to be out
on the street in six months.

319
00:22:38,893 --> 00:22:42,021
Is that true?

320
00:22:44,565 --> 00:22:46,396
You can tell Jennifer Lerner
that her mother

321
00:22:46,433 --> 00:22:48,401
doesn't know what the hell
she's talking about.

322
00:22:48,435 --> 00:22:51,029
And that if she has anything
to say to me... anything at all...

323
00:22:51,071 --> 00:22:54,336
her mother better pick up
the phone and call me herself.

324
00:22:54,375 --> 00:22:56,434
Who the hell does she think
she is?

325
00:23:00,514 --> 00:23:02,573
Sorry.

326
00:23:04,618 --> 00:23:06,677
It's okay.

327
00:23:14,361 --> 00:23:18,024
Now, can you pick the circle?

328
00:23:23,704 --> 00:23:25,672
Yeah, very good.

329
00:23:25,706 --> 00:23:27,503
Yes, one for one.

330
00:23:27,541 --> 00:23:28,667
All right.

331
00:23:28,709 --> 00:23:31,542
Now, can you find
the triangle?

332
00:23:36,217 --> 00:23:37,514
Close.

333
00:23:37,551 --> 00:23:39,178
Now, I'll give you a hint:

334
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,346
that's not it.

335
00:23:40,387 --> 00:23:41,854
It's green.

336
00:23:41,889 --> 00:23:44,722
The triangle is green.

337
00:23:48,729 --> 00:23:51,027
Yes, very good!

338
00:23:51,065 --> 00:23:53,329
All right, Henry,
we're on our way.

339
00:23:55,069 --> 00:23:56,331
Come in.

340
00:23:56,370 --> 00:23:58,361
Good afternoon, Mr. Turner.

341
00:23:58,405 --> 00:23:59,531
Hey, Bradley.

342
00:23:59,573 --> 00:24:00,870
How's it going, Red?

343
00:24:00,908 --> 00:24:02,535
We're just finishing up here.

344
00:24:02,576 --> 00:24:04,009
How you doing, Hank?

345
00:24:04,044 --> 00:24:07,502
Henry's doing just fine,
right, Henry?

346
00:24:08,515 --> 00:24:09,812
I'll see you guys later.

347
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:10,976
All right.

348
00:24:11,018 --> 00:24:12,144
Bye.

349
00:24:12,186 --> 00:24:13,483
Look, if you don't want

350
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,283
to talk at first, it's cool.

351
00:24:15,322 --> 00:24:17,313
I was a shy kid.
Kept to myself.

352
00:24:17,358 --> 00:24:18,882
Name's Bradley.

353
00:24:18,926 --> 00:24:20,826
I'll be your physical therapist

354
00:24:20,861 --> 00:24:22,886
for the remainder
of the evening.

355
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:24,989
Your own personal gym teacher.

356
00:24:25,032 --> 00:24:28,229
See that wheelchair?

357
00:24:28,269 --> 00:24:32,330
That's going to be your
best friend for a while.

358
00:24:32,373 --> 00:24:35,365
Ready?

359
00:24:37,544 --> 00:24:39,171
All right!

360
00:24:39,213 --> 00:24:41,408
My man.

361
00:24:43,384 --> 00:24:45,511
Mr. Casella!

362
00:24:45,552 --> 00:24:49,352
Watch out.
You're looking sharp, sharp.

363
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:51,221
Bradley.

364
00:24:52,726 --> 00:24:54,250
That's Mr. Casella.

365
00:24:54,295 --> 00:24:55,887
He's from Kentucky.

366
00:24:57,231 --> 00:24:58,198
Hi, Bradley.

367
00:24:58,232 --> 00:24:59,199
Julie.

368
00:24:59,233 --> 00:25:02,794
Check out the new uniform. Yow!

369
00:25:02,836 --> 00:25:05,430
Hmm! I got to get me
some of that.

370
00:25:08,342 --> 00:25:10,401
Don't get any wrong ideas, man.

371
00:25:10,444 --> 00:25:12,241
This isn't cause I like it.

372
00:25:12,279 --> 00:25:14,474
It's to get you back
in the swing.

373
00:25:14,548 --> 00:25:17,142
You're going to be playing
basketball before you know it,

374
00:25:17,184 --> 00:25:19,345
jogging ten miles a day.

375
00:25:20,521 --> 00:25:24,480
I hear you haven't been talking
very much, is that true?

376
00:25:24,525 --> 00:25:29,087
Tell me Hank, is that true,
or just a nasty-ass rumor?

377
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:31,324
Hmm.

378
00:25:31,365 --> 00:25:32,992
Must be true.

379
00:25:33,033 --> 00:25:34,000
Yo, Gloria.

380
00:25:34,034 --> 00:25:35,001
Bradley.

381
00:25:35,035 --> 00:25:37,333
That's Gloria.

382
00:25:37,371 --> 00:25:39,931
Already had me some of that.

383
00:25:44,511 --> 00:25:47,480
I'll leave you alone so
you can talk about it.

384
00:25:57,157 --> 00:25:58,317
I love this place!

385
00:25:58,359 --> 00:26:00,350
This is fabulous.

386
00:26:00,394 --> 00:26:01,520
I love it.

387
00:26:01,595 --> 00:26:04,120
I'm so glad.
I'm so glad.

388
00:26:04,164 --> 00:26:05,688
I haven't done this in ages.

389
00:26:05,733 --> 00:26:07,428
Well, you're a genius,
you know that.

390
00:26:07,468 --> 00:26:10,437
New York real estate needs you,
my dear.

391
00:26:10,471 --> 00:26:12,132
This country needs you.

392
00:26:12,172 --> 00:26:14,970
I know that you know this,

393
00:26:15,009 --> 00:26:17,307
but if you or Rachel
ever need anything...

394
00:26:17,344 --> 00:26:19,005
Please, no.

395
00:26:19,046 --> 00:26:20,274
No, seriously.

396
00:26:20,314 --> 00:26:22,441
Pity scares me.

397
00:26:22,483 --> 00:26:26,681
Actually, this whole thing's
making me a stronger person.

398
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,483
Really.

399
00:26:28,589 --> 00:26:32,992
And Henry's getting better
every day, so...

400
00:26:33,027 --> 00:26:35,825
Sarah, this is me
you're talking to.

401
00:26:43,537 --> 00:26:45,971
He can't walk.

402
00:26:46,006 --> 00:26:48,474
He can't speak.

403
00:26:48,509 --> 00:26:52,741
He doesn't...
remember us.

404
00:26:54,748 --> 00:26:59,685
Nobody knows what's going
to happen.

405
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,688
I talked to our accountant
last week.

406
00:27:01,722 --> 00:27:04,452
And?

407
00:27:04,491 --> 00:27:07,460
Well, it's not good.

408
00:27:07,494 --> 00:27:10,861
We have nothing put away,
really.

409
00:27:10,898 --> 00:27:12,695
A few stocks.

410
00:27:12,733 --> 00:27:14,758
All we have is the apartment,

411
00:27:14,802 --> 00:27:18,397
which isn't worth what it was
five years ago.

412
00:27:18,439 --> 00:27:22,068
Without Henry's income,
things...

413
00:27:22,109 --> 00:27:24,942
maybe not tomorrow, but things
are going to have to change.

414
00:27:24,978 --> 00:27:28,744
Honey, can I give you
a little advice?

415
00:27:28,782 --> 00:27:33,685
Don't, do not tell anyone else
what you just told me.

416
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,051
Mm-hmm.

417
00:27:35,089 --> 00:27:36,613
If I were you,

418
00:27:36,657 --> 00:27:39,683
I would... go out
with a few friends,

419
00:27:39,726 --> 00:27:42,217
and spend a whole lot of money.

420
00:27:43,697 --> 00:27:45,858
Would you like
to walk through again?

421
00:27:45,899 --> 00:27:47,764
Oh, no, I don't have to, thanks.

422
00:27:47,801 --> 00:27:49,063
I'll take it.

423
00:27:49,103 --> 00:27:50,092
See what I mean?

424
00:27:50,137 --> 00:27:52,298
Just like that.

425
00:27:53,841 --> 00:27:55,399
Come on... ball.

426
00:27:55,442 --> 00:28:00,607
Now, you can hear the word
in your head, can't you?

427
00:28:00,647 --> 00:28:03,741
Good, good, now,
try to say it.

428
00:28:03,784 --> 00:28:04,978
Come on.

429
00:28:05,018 --> 00:28:08,010
You can do it.

430
00:28:08,055 --> 00:28:10,114
Ball.

431
00:28:10,157 --> 00:28:13,354
I know this is frustrating
for you,

432
00:28:13,393 --> 00:28:16,487
but you can do it. Ball.

433
00:28:19,733 --> 00:28:20,893
Come in.

434
00:28:20,934 --> 00:28:22,458
Boom ba doomp boomp

435
00:28:22,536 --> 00:28:24,401
Ow! Boomp, boomp, boomp

436
00:28:24,438 --> 00:28:26,804
Boomp, boomp,
boomp, boomp, ow!

437
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,808
Danananananaong!

438
00:28:28,842 --> 00:28:30,275
Ah!

439
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:31,470
Hello, Bradley.

440
00:28:31,545 --> 00:28:34,173
Thank you, thank you,
good night.

441
00:28:34,214 --> 00:28:36,114
You've been
a wonderful crowd.

442
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:37,640
Yo, what's up?

443
00:28:37,684 --> 00:28:40,244
Oh, just working
with the strong, silent type.

444
00:28:40,287 --> 00:28:42,084
Still no word
from the man, huh?

445
00:28:42,122 --> 00:28:45,182
No, but we're making progress.

446
00:28:47,828 --> 00:28:49,056
Breakfast.

447
00:29:09,082 --> 00:29:10,447
Thank you.

448
00:29:10,484 --> 00:29:12,918
Mm-hmm.

449
00:29:12,953 --> 00:29:13,942
Here you go.

450
00:29:13,987 --> 00:29:15,215
Thank you.
It looks fine.

451
00:29:15,255 --> 00:29:16,449
All right, listen.

452
00:29:16,557 --> 00:29:17,956
Since you're still not making

453
00:29:17,991 --> 00:29:20,459
any noise,
I'm choosing the menu.

454
00:29:20,527 --> 00:29:23,360
When you start to talk,
you can pick.

455
00:29:23,397 --> 00:29:24,455
Eggs Bradley.

456
00:29:24,531 --> 00:29:26,294
Made 'em myself.

457
00:29:28,769 --> 00:29:30,794
Hope you like 'em.

458
00:29:47,087 --> 00:29:49,783
What's wrong,
don't like my eggs?

459
00:29:49,823 --> 00:29:51,688
Ah! Agh! Ah!

460
00:29:51,725 --> 00:29:54,057
What? Okay, okay, I
heard you, I heard you.

461
00:29:54,094 --> 00:29:55,994
Don't be pretending
you can't talk.

462
00:29:56,029 --> 00:29:59,021
Listen, if you don't speak,
I don't know what you want.

463
00:29:59,066 --> 00:30:00,624
All you got to do is tell me.

464
00:30:00,667 --> 00:30:01,634
Anything you want.

465
00:30:01,668 --> 00:30:03,499
All you go to do
is make the call.

466
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:05,299
This is like room service here,
man.

467
00:30:05,339 --> 00:30:06,499
You ever been to a hotel?

468
00:30:06,573 --> 00:30:07,505
So, what do you want?

469
00:30:07,608 --> 00:30:09,075
Cheeseburger? Huh?
No, no, no.

470
00:30:09,109 --> 00:30:11,168
You like caviar
and shit like that, right?

471
00:30:11,211 --> 00:30:13,475
Cool, man, just-just tell me
you want caviar.

472
00:30:15,048 --> 00:30:16,242
Come on, say "caviar."

473
00:30:16,283 --> 00:30:17,375
"Ca-vi-ar."

474
00:30:18,619 --> 00:30:22,521
What? Come on, man, say it.

475
00:30:22,623 --> 00:30:24,147
R-Ritz.

476
00:30:24,191 --> 00:30:25,419
Ritz?

477
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,525
You want some crackers?

478
00:30:28,629 --> 00:30:31,154
You can have anything you want,
and you want some crackers.

479
00:30:32,566 --> 00:30:35,865
Get this man some Ritz crackers!

480
00:30:35,902 --> 00:30:37,130
Ritz.

481
00:30:39,573 --> 00:30:41,632
The work they do at Lawrence

482
00:30:41,675 --> 00:30:44,109
is just... inspiring.

483
00:30:44,144 --> 00:30:45,634
Henry's doing wonderfully.

484
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:47,476
You wouldn't believe your eyes.

485
00:30:47,514 --> 00:30:50,347
I knew he'd set records
for recovery.

486
00:30:50,384 --> 00:30:52,545
Well,
you'd be very proud of him.

487
00:30:52,653 --> 00:30:53,881
He's working hard.

488
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,080
Working hard... Henry?

489
00:30:55,122 --> 00:30:57,147
I can't imagine.

490
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:59,317
Every day I'm there,
it just amazes me.

491
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:00,553
He's lucky to have you.

492
00:31:00,594 --> 00:31:01,754
I second that.

493
00:31:01,795 --> 00:31:02,955
Thank you.

494
00:31:02,996 --> 00:31:04,361
I wanted to ask.

495
00:31:04,398 --> 00:31:06,958
Now, don't take this
the wrong way, darling.

496
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:12,165
I wanted to make sure...
that things are under control.

497
00:31:12,205 --> 00:31:13,502
That you're okay.

498
00:31:13,573 --> 00:31:18,476
Well... considering,
I'm perfect.

499
00:31:18,512 --> 00:31:21,310
I really do think
everything's going to be okay.

500
00:31:21,348 --> 00:31:23,908
It may take some time
to get back to normal,

501
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:26,077
but... it's going to happen.

502
00:31:26,119 --> 00:31:27,450
I mean, financially.

503
00:31:27,487 --> 00:31:28,886
Oh.

504
00:31:28,922 --> 00:31:30,947
Gee, I hate to leave you
with the bill,

505
00:31:30,991 --> 00:31:32,515
but you'd be paying anyway,
right?

506
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:33,685
Got to get to court.

507
00:31:33,727 --> 00:31:35,058
It was good to see you, Sarah.

508
00:31:35,095 --> 00:31:37,359
Oh, thank you.

509
00:31:37,397 --> 00:31:38,887
I know this is awkward.

510
00:31:38,932 --> 00:31:41,958
There are some things
we just don't talk about,

511
00:31:42,002 --> 00:31:44,869
but you and Henry are family,
you know that.

512
00:31:44,905 --> 00:31:46,930
Are you all right?

513
00:31:46,973 --> 00:31:50,136
Because, if you need help,
anything, I'm prepared to...

514
00:31:50,177 --> 00:31:52,543
We're in wonderful shape.

515
00:31:52,579 --> 00:31:54,547
No problems.

516
00:31:54,581 --> 00:31:55,707
Really, thank you.

517
00:31:55,749 --> 00:31:57,182
You're so sweet to offer.

518
00:31:57,217 --> 00:32:00,152
I knew
I could count on Henry.

519
00:32:01,756 --> 00:32:03,747
All right, my man.

520
00:32:03,791 --> 00:32:05,850
You know what this is?

521
00:32:05,893 --> 00:32:08,191
It's called a walker.

522
00:32:08,229 --> 00:32:09,628
Walker.

523
00:32:09,664 --> 00:32:11,791
Yeah, but that's
a load of bullshit,

524
00:32:11,832 --> 00:32:13,959
'cause you're doing
all the walking.

525
00:32:14,001 --> 00:32:16,993
Now, let's see if we
can get you standing up, huh?

526
00:32:17,038 --> 00:32:18,801
Scoot up for me a little bit.

527
00:32:18,839 --> 00:32:19,863
Good, okay.

528
00:32:19,907 --> 00:32:21,738
Sit tall, sit tall.

529
00:32:21,776 --> 00:32:23,710
Now lean towards me.

530
00:32:23,744 --> 00:32:27,009
I want you to push up, push up
with your arms and your legs.

531
00:32:27,048 --> 00:32:29,141
Push up, push up,
push up, very good.

532
00:32:29,183 --> 00:32:32,050
I got you, I got you,
don't worry about it.

533
00:32:32,086 --> 00:32:34,247
Good, very good.

534
00:32:34,288 --> 00:32:35,516
How's that feel?

535
00:32:35,556 --> 00:32:37,888
I don't know.

536
00:32:37,925 --> 00:32:39,415
Yeah, all that upper-body work's

537
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:40,654
getting ready to pay off.

538
00:32:40,695 --> 00:32:44,222
Put your right hand over there
on the walker.

539
00:32:44,265 --> 00:32:48,031
Good, good, okay.

540
00:32:48,069 --> 00:32:49,536
I got you.

541
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:51,162
You're doing real good, Hank.

542
00:32:51,205 --> 00:32:52,672
Doing real good.

543
00:32:52,707 --> 00:32:55,904
Okay, now, the first
thing I want you to do

544
00:32:55,943 --> 00:32:58,537
is slide that
walker forward, okay?

545
00:32:58,646 --> 00:33:00,546
Slide your left leg,
and bend it.

546
00:33:00,615 --> 00:33:02,913
Slide your
left leg, and bend it.

547
00:33:04,685 --> 00:33:07,051
Good, now stand tall,
stand tall, straight.

548
00:33:07,088 --> 00:33:09,716
Step.

549
00:33:09,757 --> 00:33:11,622
Good job, Hank, good job.

550
00:33:11,659 --> 00:33:13,388
Now slide.

551
00:33:13,427 --> 00:33:17,090
Bend and slide your left leg.

552
00:33:17,131 --> 00:33:22,330
Stand tall, and... step.

553
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:24,235
Good job.

554
00:33:24,272 --> 00:33:26,297
Push the walker forward.

555
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:28,638
Bend and slide.

556
00:33:28,676 --> 00:33:30,371
Stand tall.

557
00:33:30,411 --> 00:33:33,141
Step, you're doing it man,
you're doing it, baby.

558
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:34,670
Go ahead, push it forward.

559
00:33:34,715 --> 00:33:39,152
Left, left, bend, slide,
stand up straight.

560
00:33:39,186 --> 00:33:40,380
Step. There you go, man,

561
00:33:40,421 --> 00:33:42,116
you're stepping
like a natural man.

562
00:33:42,156 --> 00:33:43,953
Go ahead, put that
left leg forward.

563
00:33:43,991 --> 00:33:46,755
Put it forward.

564
00:33:46,794 --> 00:33:48,523
Step! Where's my video camera?

565
00:33:48,562 --> 00:33:51,463
We ought to be videotaping
this beautiful moment.

566
00:33:51,499 --> 00:33:53,797
Okay, bend that left leg.

567
00:33:53,834 --> 00:33:55,461
Slide it forward.

568
00:33:55,503 --> 00:33:56,527
Step! There you go, Hank!

569
00:33:56,637 --> 00:33:58,366
You're doing it, man,
you're doing it.

570
00:33:58,406 --> 00:33:59,737
Go ahead, bend that left leg.

571
00:33:59,774 --> 00:34:01,002
Slide it forward.

572
00:35:13,013 --> 00:35:15,777
So, my brother gets home, right?

573
00:35:15,816 --> 00:35:17,374
Goes into his bedroom.

574
00:35:17,418 --> 00:35:19,852
There's his wife
doing another man.

575
00:35:19,887 --> 00:35:21,787
The bitch was cheating.

576
00:35:21,822 --> 00:35:25,223
She was...
she cheating?

577
00:35:25,259 --> 00:35:27,489
Doing the serious
with another man.

578
00:35:27,561 --> 00:35:29,392
Sleeping with another guy.

579
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:30,658
Oh, no.

580
00:35:30,698 --> 00:35:32,029
Oh, yeah.

581
00:35:32,066 --> 00:35:35,695
And she just looks up,
and all she says is "Oops."

582
00:35:37,638 --> 00:35:40,402
So, so, then what?

583
00:35:40,441 --> 00:35:41,499
Loretta!

584
00:35:41,575 --> 00:35:44,009
-Hi.
-Looking hot.

585
00:35:44,044 --> 00:35:46,877
Mmm. She's hot.

586
00:35:46,914 --> 00:35:48,438
She's hot.

587
00:35:48,482 --> 00:35:50,109
Yeah, l-I know,

588
00:35:50,151 --> 00:35:52,449
you-you've got to get you
some of that.

589
00:35:54,255 --> 00:35:56,519
Where you going
looking so pretty?

590
00:35:56,557 --> 00:35:57,819
To get my dad.

591
00:35:57,858 --> 00:35:59,450
He doesn't remember me.

592
00:35:59,493 --> 00:36:01,484
Let's go, sweetie.

593
00:36:05,032 --> 00:36:06,795
Thanks, Eddie.

594
00:36:06,834 --> 00:36:08,165
-Okay.
-Bye.

595
00:36:10,037 --> 00:36:12,972
Go up the West Side Highway,
please.

596
00:36:25,019 --> 00:36:27,146
What's up, man?

597
00:36:27,188 --> 00:36:29,816
Hey, man, what you doing?

598
00:36:29,857 --> 00:36:32,348
Painting.

599
00:36:32,393 --> 00:36:34,384
Crackers.

600
00:36:37,131 --> 00:36:39,861
Looks great.

601
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:41,458
But you're not packed.

602
00:36:41,502 --> 00:36:44,335
Why aren't you packed?

603
00:36:44,371 --> 00:36:48,239
Um... I'm not going.

604
00:36:57,384 --> 00:36:59,682
Remember what Dr. Marx told you?

605
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:02,188
Remember when we talked
about this

606
00:37:02,223 --> 00:37:03,781
a couple days ago?

607
00:37:03,824 --> 00:37:07,920
Yeah. l-l-I changed
my mind.

608
00:37:07,962 --> 00:37:09,361
I'm going to stay.

609
00:37:09,396 --> 00:37:11,887
Your wife and daughter
are coming to pick you up.

610
00:37:11,932 --> 00:37:13,058
You're going home.

611
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:17,332
But... I live here.

612
00:37:17,371 --> 00:37:19,703
No, man, this is a pit stop.

613
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:23,267
I hear you got
a beautiful place.

614
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:26,473
You're not going to be there.

615
00:37:26,514 --> 00:37:28,482
No.

616
00:37:28,582 --> 00:37:31,050
No, I got to hang here.

617
00:37:31,085 --> 00:37:33,713
But you got your family.

618
00:37:33,754 --> 00:37:36,985
But...

619
00:37:37,024 --> 00:37:39,322
l-I...

620
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,622
I don't know them.

621
00:37:40,661 --> 00:37:42,219
l-I don't.

622
00:37:42,263 --> 00:37:43,355
They love you.

623
00:37:43,397 --> 00:37:44,830
They're going to take care
of you.

624
00:37:44,865 --> 00:37:45,991
Well, I don't want them

625
00:37:46,033 --> 00:37:47,660
to take care of me,
Bradley, I don't!

626
00:37:47,701 --> 00:37:48,998
-Listen...
-No, stop it!

627
00:37:49,036 --> 00:37:50,162
Hank, listen...

628
00:37:50,204 --> 00:37:51,171
Leave me alone, Bradley.

629
00:37:51,205 --> 00:37:53,435
Hank, you're gonna be fine.

630
00:37:53,474 --> 00:37:56,375
You got to go back sometime.

631
00:38:01,215 --> 00:38:03,183
I just...

632
00:38:03,217 --> 00:38:05,742
I just can't remember.

633
00:38:05,786 --> 00:38:08,880
I don't know those people.

634
00:38:23,737 --> 00:38:25,898
I'll be right outside.

635
00:38:28,609 --> 00:38:30,634
-Hi, Sarah.
-Hi.

636
00:38:30,678 --> 00:38:32,612
How you doing, honey?

637
00:38:32,646 --> 00:38:33,908
Fine.

638
00:38:33,948 --> 00:38:35,916
Hi, Henry.

639
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:37,542
Hi, Dad.

640
00:38:40,287 --> 00:38:42,551
Hi.

641
00:38:48,696 --> 00:38:50,857
We think it's time
you come home.

642
00:38:50,898 --> 00:38:53,799
Yeah, uh, he told me.

643
00:38:53,834 --> 00:38:56,496
Bradley... told me.

644
00:38:56,537 --> 00:38:58,767
Is that okay?

645
00:38:58,806 --> 00:39:00,398
Do you want to come home?

646
00:39:02,876 --> 00:39:04,571
What about Bradley?

647
00:39:04,612 --> 00:39:08,446
Bradley
can take care of himself.

648
00:39:08,482 --> 00:39:10,746
And you've got us.

649
00:39:10,784 --> 00:39:12,445
And we're going to help you

650
00:39:12,553 --> 00:39:15,078
in every way we can,
aren't we, honey?

651
00:39:15,122 --> 00:39:18,114
You've got a life back at home.

652
00:39:18,158 --> 00:39:20,456
A life with friends and family,

653
00:39:20,494 --> 00:39:23,019
and everything
you could ever want.

654
00:39:23,063 --> 00:39:26,590
All you have to do
is say you want to come home.

655
00:39:26,634 --> 00:39:28,465
That's all.

656
00:39:28,569 --> 00:39:30,366
It's easy.

657
00:39:34,208 --> 00:39:35,800
I don't want to.

658
00:39:44,251 --> 00:39:45,718
We already discussed this.

659
00:39:45,753 --> 00:39:48,483
I think it may be premature
for Henry to go home.

660
00:39:48,589 --> 00:39:51,057
I think he should want to first.

661
00:39:51,091 --> 00:39:53,059
I just want what's best.

662
00:40:05,105 --> 00:40:07,096
Hi.

663
00:40:07,141 --> 00:40:09,735
I'm Bradley.

664
00:40:17,951 --> 00:40:20,215
He's not mad at you.

665
00:40:20,254 --> 00:40:24,782
Hey, why don't you go
and talk to him?

666
00:41:10,604 --> 00:41:11,969
Big loop...

667
00:41:12,005 --> 00:41:14,166
little loop...

668
00:41:14,208 --> 00:41:16,005
cross over...

669
00:41:16,043 --> 00:41:18,102
pull through.

670
00:41:21,148 --> 00:41:23,981
How did you learn to do that?

671
00:41:24,017 --> 00:41:26,144
You taught me.

672
00:41:28,489 --> 00:41:31,754
It was gray carpet.

673
00:41:31,792 --> 00:41:34,727
I remember gray carpet.

674
00:41:36,597 --> 00:41:39,088
Where was that?

675
00:41:39,133 --> 00:41:41,397
That was home.

676
00:41:47,775 --> 00:41:49,800
I remember gray carpet.

677
00:41:49,843 --> 00:41:52,607
I want to go home.

678
00:41:55,816 --> 00:41:57,181
You okay, honey?

679
00:41:57,217 --> 00:41:58,582
Come on, Rachel.

680
00:42:04,091 --> 00:42:05,820
Henry?

681
00:42:05,859 --> 00:42:07,724
Come on.

682
00:42:10,764 --> 00:42:13,961
A Walkman,
for a walking man.

683
00:42:14,001 --> 00:42:14,968
Wow.

684
00:42:15,002 --> 00:42:15,969
When you get home,

685
00:42:16,003 --> 00:42:17,265
I want you
to listen to this

686
00:42:17,304 --> 00:42:18,828
and think of
your friend Bradley.

687
00:42:18,872 --> 00:42:20,897
Am I going to see you?

688
00:42:20,941 --> 00:42:21,908
Yeah.

689
00:42:21,942 --> 00:42:23,307
Promise?

690
00:42:23,343 --> 00:42:25,311
Hell, yeah, I promise.

691
00:42:29,683 --> 00:42:31,583
Okay, bye.

692
00:42:34,188 --> 00:42:35,780
Thanks.

693
00:42:37,324 --> 00:42:39,383
Hey, it's what I do.

694
00:42:39,426 --> 00:42:40,654
High five.

695
00:42:45,365 --> 00:42:46,354
Bye.

696
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,458
Bye.

697
00:43:21,335 --> 00:43:22,302
Hi, Eddie.

698
00:43:22,336 --> 00:43:23,303
Hi, Rach.

699
00:43:23,337 --> 00:43:24,304
Hi, Eddie.

700
00:43:24,338 --> 00:43:25,305
Hi.

701
00:43:25,339 --> 00:43:26,306
Hi, Eddie.

702
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:27,773
Good to see you, Mr. Turner.

703
00:43:41,922 --> 00:43:44,083
Wow.

704
00:43:44,124 --> 00:43:48,424
This is home.

705
00:43:58,338 --> 00:44:01,330
Wow.

706
00:44:01,375 --> 00:44:03,343
I remember the smell.

707
00:44:03,377 --> 00:44:05,709
I don't smell anything.

708
00:44:05,746 --> 00:44:09,204
Nice table.

709
00:44:11,785 --> 00:44:13,810
Henry?

710
00:44:13,854 --> 00:44:16,152
Yeah?

711
00:44:16,189 --> 00:44:18,316
Are you coming to bed?

712
00:44:22,329 --> 00:44:25,298
I'm gonna sleep there?

713
00:44:25,332 --> 00:44:28,301
Yeah.

714
00:44:28,335 --> 00:44:30,826
This is your side.

715
00:44:30,871 --> 00:44:32,532
Okay.

716
00:45:31,431 --> 00:45:34,832
I remember your hair.

717
00:45:39,773 --> 00:45:42,799
Everything's going to be okay.

718
00:45:42,843 --> 00:45:46,108
Everything.

719
00:45:49,316 --> 00:45:51,341
You look good, Mr. Henry.

720
00:45:51,385 --> 00:45:52,818
Real good.

721
00:45:52,853 --> 00:45:54,514
Your face and everything.

722
00:45:54,588 --> 00:45:55,850
Thanks.

723
00:45:55,889 --> 00:45:58,949
Oh, eggs.
No, I don't like eggs.

724
00:45:58,992 --> 00:46:00,118
What?

725
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:01,821
-Eggs are your favorite.
-Yeah.

726
00:46:01,862 --> 00:46:04,456
Okay, give me a lot of eggs.

727
00:46:04,531 --> 00:46:06,192
This is wonderful.

728
00:46:06,233 --> 00:46:07,632
All of us together again.

729
00:46:07,667 --> 00:46:10,295
We never used to eat breakfast
together.

730
00:46:10,337 --> 00:46:11,964
Well, I always wished we had.

731
00:46:12,005 --> 00:46:13,666
Oh, I'm sorry.

732
00:46:13,707 --> 00:46:17,473
That's okay,
I do that all the time.

733
00:46:17,511 --> 00:46:18,773
You do?

734
00:46:18,812 --> 00:46:20,006
Yeah.

735
00:46:20,047 --> 00:46:22,140
See?

736
00:46:43,070 --> 00:46:44,594
Henry?

737
00:46:44,638 --> 00:46:46,629
I'll be back in 20 minutes.

738
00:46:46,673 --> 00:46:48,903
Now, if you need anything,
just ask Rosella.

739
00:46:48,942 --> 00:46:51,502
Okay, the woman with the eggs.

740
00:46:51,611 --> 00:46:52,908
That's right.

741
00:46:52,946 --> 00:46:53,970
Ready.

742
00:46:54,014 --> 00:46:56,209
Okay, be back soon.

743
00:46:56,249 --> 00:46:57,648
Bye.

744
00:46:57,684 --> 00:46:58,651
Bye.

745
00:46:58,685 --> 00:46:59,652
Bye.

746
00:46:59,686 --> 00:47:00,812
Did you get your books?

747
00:47:00,854 --> 00:47:03,015
Yeah.

748
00:47:03,056 --> 00:47:05,115
I'm taking Rachel to school.

749
00:47:05,158 --> 00:47:06,250
Keep an eye on him?

750
00:47:06,293 --> 00:47:08,193
Is Mr. Henry okay?

751
00:47:08,228 --> 00:47:12,164
Yes. He's fine.

752
00:47:12,199 --> 00:47:15,191
Come on, honey.

753
00:47:15,235 --> 00:47:16,827
You okay?

754
00:47:16,870 --> 00:47:18,497
Yeah.

755
00:47:43,630 --> 00:47:45,757
You need anything, Mr. Henry?

756
00:47:45,799 --> 00:47:48,199
No. Thank you.

757
00:47:48,235 --> 00:47:53,639
Rosella... what do I do,
uh, when I'm home?

758
00:47:53,673 --> 00:47:56,506
You are working
all the time.

759
00:47:56,576 --> 00:47:58,510
l-I work a-a lot?

760
00:47:58,545 --> 00:48:02,242
You work so hard,
I can't believe it.

761
00:48:02,282 --> 00:48:06,412
What, what, what do I do
when I'm not working.

762
00:48:06,453 --> 00:48:09,752
You're always working.

763
00:48:11,825 --> 00:48:14,726
Welcome home, Mr. Henry.

764
00:49:24,064 --> 00:49:26,362
Thank you.

765
00:49:26,399 --> 00:49:28,060
Just a minute, please.

766
00:49:37,210 --> 00:49:38,404
Hello, Mr. Turner.

767
00:49:38,445 --> 00:49:39,878
Hi.

768
00:49:44,451 --> 00:49:45,850
Hello, Mr. Turner.

769
00:49:45,885 --> 00:49:47,477
Hi.

770
00:49:52,058 --> 00:49:54,322
There you are.

771
00:49:54,361 --> 00:49:55,487
Thank you.

772
00:49:55,528 --> 00:49:56,586
Bye-bye now.

773
00:49:56,630 --> 00:49:57,619
Thanks.

774
00:50:03,603 --> 00:50:05,264
Hi, Eddie.

775
00:50:05,305 --> 00:50:07,034
Morning, Mr. Turner.

776
00:50:07,073 --> 00:50:08,700
I'm going to take
a walk now.

777
00:50:08,742 --> 00:50:10,869
Have a good time, sir.

778
00:50:19,719 --> 00:50:21,812
What are you?
A goddamn retard?!

779
00:50:21,855 --> 00:50:23,720
Get the hell out of the street!

780
00:50:30,096 --> 00:50:32,064
Where's Henry?

781
00:50:32,098 --> 00:50:34,396
In your room, I think.

782
00:50:34,434 --> 00:50:36,868
Henry, where are you?

783
00:50:39,773 --> 00:50:41,536
Okay.

784
00:50:41,574 --> 00:50:43,064
Thanks.

785
00:50:43,109 --> 00:50:44,542
Hi.

786
00:50:44,611 --> 00:50:45,543
Hi.

787
00:50:45,645 --> 00:50:46,669
Hungry?

788
00:50:46,713 --> 00:50:47,805
Yeah.

789
00:50:47,847 --> 00:50:49,246
That's what I like to hear.

790
00:50:49,282 --> 00:50:50,715
Mustard and kraut?

791
00:50:50,750 --> 00:50:52,445
Kraut?

792
00:51:01,561 --> 00:51:03,028
Where is he?

793
00:51:22,682 --> 00:51:25,310
Hello. It's Henry.

794
00:51:41,134 --> 00:51:43,694
Check it out, check it out.

795
00:52:23,543 --> 00:52:24,737
Oh, my.

796
00:52:24,778 --> 00:52:27,406
He was wearing a blue shirt
and khaki pants.

797
00:52:27,447 --> 00:52:31,008
Listen, you're the fifth person
to ask me these questions.

798
00:52:31,050 --> 00:52:32,779
I just want to find my husband.

799
00:53:04,184 --> 00:53:05,981
I'll wait here.

800
00:53:06,019 --> 00:53:07,486
I won't be long, sweetheart.

801
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:10,011
I've just got to go look.

802
00:53:12,859 --> 00:53:14,656
Henry!

803
00:53:14,694 --> 00:53:16,161
Where were you?

804
00:53:16,196 --> 00:53:17,322
I bought a dog.

805
00:53:17,363 --> 00:53:18,660
Mom, look!

806
00:53:18,698 --> 00:53:22,134
A puppy, look!

807
00:53:23,703 --> 00:53:24,829
Wow.

808
00:53:24,871 --> 00:53:26,702
You really missed me, huh?

809
00:53:26,739 --> 00:53:27,967
Can we call him Buddy?

810
00:53:28,007 --> 00:53:31,067
Jennifer has a dog named Buddy,
but he's really ugly.

811
00:53:31,110 --> 00:53:32,077
Buddy.

812
00:53:32,111 --> 00:53:33,169
Yeah, is that okay?

813
00:53:33,213 --> 00:53:34,680
How you doing?
Sit, boy.

814
00:53:34,714 --> 00:53:36,511
Yeah, Buddy's fine.

815
00:53:36,616 --> 00:53:38,675
Hi, Buddy.

816
00:53:38,718 --> 00:53:42,347
Just let me know
before you go out next time.

817
00:53:42,388 --> 00:53:43,355
Okay?

818
00:53:43,389 --> 00:53:44,356
Okay.

819
00:53:44,390 --> 00:53:45,516
Sit, boy.

820
00:53:45,558 --> 00:53:47,185
Excuse me.

821
00:53:47,227 --> 00:53:49,058
Shh. Oh, sweetie.

822
00:53:49,095 --> 00:53:50,687
Buddy...

823
00:53:50,730 --> 00:53:52,322
Why is she so mad?

824
00:53:52,365 --> 00:53:55,163
If you're going to be late,
you have to call her.

825
00:53:55,201 --> 00:53:57,192
Oh.

826
00:53:57,237 --> 00:53:58,932
Okay.

827
00:53:59,006 --> 00:54:02,203
Some of them
you can borrow and take home,

828
00:54:02,242 --> 00:54:05,803
but some of them
you have to read here.

829
00:54:05,846 --> 00:54:07,814
And you can't talk loud.

830
00:54:07,848 --> 00:54:10,112
Right.

831
00:54:29,703 --> 00:54:31,933
Dad, stop it.

832
00:54:58,065 --> 00:54:59,623
Dad!

833
00:54:59,666 --> 00:55:01,861
I'm serious.

834
00:55:01,902 --> 00:55:03,130
I know.

835
00:55:03,170 --> 00:55:05,331
V-Very.

836
00:55:32,032 --> 00:55:33,659
Dad.

837
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:35,725
Read your book.

838
00:55:38,872 --> 00:55:41,966
I can't.

839
00:55:43,877 --> 00:55:46,675
I'm sorry.

840
00:55:46,713 --> 00:55:48,010
A...

841
00:55:48,048 --> 00:55:49,174
Ah.

842
00:55:49,216 --> 00:55:50,342
Ah...

843
00:55:50,383 --> 00:55:54,342
Ah... roo...

844
00:55:54,387 --> 00:55:56,014
Ahroo,

845
00:55:56,056 --> 00:55:57,523
ahrooee.

846
00:55:57,557 --> 00:55:58,683
The "E" is silent.

847
00:55:58,725 --> 00:56:00,852
-See, it's just "are."
-Are."

848
00:56:00,894 --> 00:56:03,454
Now Miss Petesky
always made us repeat it

849
00:56:03,497 --> 00:56:07,627
over and over,
but I won't make you do that.

850
00:56:07,667 --> 00:56:10,158
This next one's easy.

851
00:56:10,203 --> 00:56:11,397
Wiii...

852
00:56:11,438 --> 00:56:12,700
U...

853
00:56:12,739 --> 00:56:16,140
U... yoo...

854
00:56:16,176 --> 00:56:18,474
Yo...

855
00:56:18,512 --> 00:56:20,309
yo...

856
00:56:20,347 --> 00:56:21,473
Ooh.

857
00:56:21,515 --> 00:56:24,484
Yo, youu.

858
00:56:24,518 --> 00:56:26,145
Yo... ooh...

859
00:56:26,186 --> 00:56:29,314
-Yo. "You. You."
-You."

860
00:56:29,356 --> 00:56:30,323
"Are you."

861
00:56:30,357 --> 00:56:31,824
"You, you."

862
00:56:31,858 --> 00:56:34,486
See, the letters make up words,
and the words make up sentences.

863
00:56:34,594 --> 00:56:35,788
"Are you."

864
00:56:35,829 --> 00:56:38,992
This is a little one.

865
00:56:39,032 --> 00:56:45,335
Mmm... mmm...

866
00:56:45,372 --> 00:56:47,499
Mmm, wha, wha.

867
00:56:47,541 --> 00:56:49,031
Mmm, why?

868
00:56:49,075 --> 00:56:51,168
Mmmiii... my?

869
00:56:51,211 --> 00:56:52,337
"My. My"?

870
00:56:52,379 --> 00:56:53,846
"My"!

871
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:55,006
"Are you my."

872
00:56:55,048 --> 00:56:56,174
"Are you my."

873
00:56:56,216 --> 00:56:57,683
Okay, one more.

874
00:56:57,717 --> 00:56:59,685
This is the toughy.

875
00:56:59,719 --> 00:57:01,846
Mmm, mmm,

876
00:57:01,888 --> 00:57:04,789
moooat, moat...

877
00:57:04,824 --> 00:57:07,622
"Th", remember, thhhhh.

878
00:57:07,661 --> 00:57:10,459
Moooo, moooth,

879
00:57:10,497 --> 00:57:13,295
moooth, moooth.

880
00:57:13,333 --> 00:57:15,824
Mooth.

881
00:57:15,869 --> 00:57:19,464
Er. Er...

882
00:57:19,573 --> 00:57:21,803
Mooth er.

883
00:57:21,841 --> 00:57:25,140
Ma, ma, ma, moth.

884
00:57:25,178 --> 00:57:27,305
Moth er.

885
00:57:27,347 --> 00:57:28,473
Mo, moth er.

886
00:57:28,515 --> 00:57:30,142
"Mother"!

887
00:57:30,183 --> 00:57:31,150
"Mother"?

888
00:57:31,184 --> 00:57:32,151
-"Mother."
-Ha!

889
00:57:32,185 --> 00:57:33,152
You did it!

890
00:57:33,186 --> 00:57:35,814
"Are you my mother?"

891
00:57:35,855 --> 00:57:37,117
I... I can read!

892
00:57:37,157 --> 00:57:38,647
Sarah, Rosella.

893
00:57:38,692 --> 00:57:40,489
-I can read.
-He can read!

894
00:57:40,527 --> 00:57:41,653
-I can read!
-He can read!

895
00:57:41,695 --> 00:57:44,323
Ayy, ayy, jax.

896
00:57:44,364 --> 00:57:46,161
A-Ajax!
This is Ajax.

897
00:57:46,199 --> 00:57:47,461
Yes, it is!

898
00:57:50,203 --> 00:57:51,830
I can read!
I can read!

899
00:57:51,871 --> 00:57:53,168
What happened?

900
00:57:53,206 --> 00:57:54,468
-She taught me how to read!
-I taught Dad to read!

901
00:57:54,507 --> 00:57:55,838
This is Ajax!

902
00:57:55,875 --> 00:57:56,842
That's great!

903
00:57:56,876 --> 00:57:57,808
I can read!

904
00:57:58,979 --> 00:58:00,310
That's right!

905
00:58:07,887 --> 00:58:09,946
The door was unlocked.

906
00:58:09,990 --> 00:58:12,458
I knocked, but...

907
00:58:12,559 --> 00:58:14,322
I can read.

908
00:58:14,361 --> 00:58:16,625
Hi, Henry.

909
00:58:23,837 --> 00:58:26,806
Christ, I can't tell you
what a shock it was.

910
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:29,138
I mean, one minute
you're at the restaurant,

911
00:58:29,175 --> 00:58:31,336
the next, you know...

912
00:58:33,013 --> 00:58:34,105
And the newspapers.

913
00:58:34,147 --> 00:58:36,809
Jesus, they never stopped
calling the office.

914
00:58:36,850 --> 00:58:39,410
Charlie was out of his mind.

915
00:58:39,452 --> 00:58:44,856
Linda... everybody.

916
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:49,055
Henry...

917
00:58:51,364 --> 00:58:53,025
If they'd found
that son of a bitch,

918
00:58:53,066 --> 00:58:54,658
I'd have brought
the death penalty

919
00:58:54,701 --> 00:58:58,467
back to New York
single-handedly.

920
00:58:59,539 --> 00:59:02,201
Anyway.

921
00:59:04,577 --> 00:59:07,444
So, uh, here we are, huh?

922
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:10,449
And, uh...

923
00:59:10,483 --> 00:59:15,284
we got the big party coming up.

924
00:59:15,322 --> 00:59:18,348
I'm looking forward to then.

925
00:59:18,391 --> 00:59:21,827
And... I know Charlie is, too.

926
00:59:24,497 --> 00:59:27,955
W-Were we
really good friends...

927
00:59:28,001 --> 00:59:29,059
Bruce?

928
00:59:29,102 --> 00:59:31,627
Yeah.

929
00:59:31,671 --> 00:59:32,763
Oh, of course.

930
00:59:32,806 --> 00:59:34,797
You know, we're... partners.

931
00:59:34,841 --> 00:59:36,331
You know.

932
00:59:39,846 --> 00:59:42,644
Mm.

933
00:59:42,682 --> 00:59:45,810
Aren't you going to open it?

934
00:59:45,852 --> 00:59:47,513
Oh, yeah.

935
00:59:55,695 --> 00:59:58,664
It...

936
00:59:58,698 --> 01:00:00,666
it's a...

937
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:02,827
You know, it's a frame, it's...

938
01:00:02,869 --> 01:00:04,393
it's just a little frame, but...

939
01:00:04,437 --> 01:00:07,702
Okay. Thanks.

940
01:00:10,810 --> 01:00:13,005
"What am I going to do
with him?" Henry's Dad said.

941
01:00:13,046 --> 01:00:14,172
"I've grounded him,

942
01:00:14,214 --> 01:00:16,182
but I don't know
what to do with that boy."

943
01:00:16,216 --> 01:00:17,513
I said, "Are you kidding?

944
01:00:17,550 --> 01:00:18,676
"Grounded him?

945
01:00:18,718 --> 01:00:20,652
I want that boy in the firm."

946
01:00:23,056 --> 01:00:24,523
And as it turned out,

947
01:00:24,557 --> 01:00:27,219
it was the best decision
I ever made.

948
01:00:29,396 --> 01:00:30,624
For years,

949
01:00:30,663 --> 01:00:33,530
the halls of our firm
have resounded with the call

950
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:35,830
of Henry Turner throwing
on his jacket,

951
01:00:35,869 --> 01:00:37,530
striding through the office,

952
01:00:37,570 --> 01:00:41,062
crying, "Come on, guys, let's
go out and break some balls."

953
01:00:42,575 --> 01:00:44,668
I offer a toast to the years
to come

954
01:00:44,711 --> 01:00:46,542
when once more we will hear
that familiar cry.

955
01:00:46,579 --> 01:00:47,546
To Henry!

956
01:00:47,580 --> 01:00:48,638
To Henry!

957
01:00:48,681 --> 01:00:51,172
-Henry!
-To Henry!

958
01:01:02,529 --> 01:01:06,966
S-Sarah... Sarah s-said
I should say something.

959
01:01:10,036 --> 01:01:13,836
Uh... I don't remember
a-any of you.

960
01:01:13,873 --> 01:01:18,367
I don't really remember

961
01:01:18,411 --> 01:01:21,346
very much of-of anything, and...

962
01:01:21,381 --> 01:01:27,877
um, it's all mixed up, um...

963
01:01:27,921 --> 01:01:29,889
Like I remember...

964
01:01:29,923 --> 01:01:32,187
um...

965
01:01:32,225 --> 01:01:36,355
that Rachel likes strawberries
on her pancakes,

966
01:01:36,396 --> 01:01:39,194
but I don't...

967
01:01:39,232 --> 01:01:42,326
remember any
of her birthday parties,

968
01:01:42,368 --> 01:01:45,860
although I saw pictures,
and I was there.

969
01:01:45,905 --> 01:01:47,873
Um...

970
01:01:47,907 --> 01:01:53,209
I... I rem... remember
a woman in a blue dress

971
01:01:53,246 --> 01:01:55,214
standing on grass,

972
01:01:55,248 --> 01:01:58,547
and, um...

973
01:01:58,585 --> 01:02:02,487
l-I think that's my mother, but
I don't know if it's my mother.

974
01:02:02,522 --> 01:02:07,824
Um...

975
01:02:07,861 --> 01:02:10,329
So-so if you'll...
if you just be patient,

976
01:02:10,363 --> 01:02:13,526
I'll... I'm trying.

977
01:02:27,614 --> 01:02:31,448
And here's another one of me
as a baby.

978
01:02:36,556 --> 01:02:38,023
Wh-Who's this?

979
01:02:38,057 --> 01:02:40,355
You.

980
01:02:40,393 --> 01:02:42,691
Your father used to make you
mow the lawn

981
01:02:42,729 --> 01:02:45,027
and take out the garbage
and walk the dog

982
01:02:45,064 --> 01:02:46,361
and wash the car,

983
01:02:46,399 --> 01:02:49,232
and then you learn
to appreciate the work ethic.

984
01:02:51,070 --> 01:02:52,037
What's that?

985
01:02:52,071 --> 01:02:54,562
I don't know.

986
01:03:25,905 --> 01:03:27,304
Bike.

987
01:03:30,209 --> 01:03:31,176
Hi.

988
01:03:31,210 --> 01:03:32,177
Hi, Henry.

989
01:03:32,211 --> 01:03:33,337
Hi.

990
01:03:33,379 --> 01:03:35,006
-Good to see you.
-Hello.

991
01:03:35,048 --> 01:03:36,174
Hey, good to see you.

992
01:03:36,215 --> 01:03:37,842
Oh, thank you. Hi.

993
01:03:37,884 --> 01:03:39,010
-Hi, Darcy.
-Hi.

994
01:03:39,052 --> 01:03:40,178
-Hello.
-Hi.

995
01:03:40,219 --> 01:03:41,686
Hi.

996
01:03:41,721 --> 01:03:43,018
It's great to see you back.

997
01:03:43,056 --> 01:03:44,182
Oh, thank you.

998
01:03:44,223 --> 01:03:45,485
You look great, Henry.

999
01:03:45,525 --> 01:03:46,492
Hi.

1000
01:03:46,526 --> 01:03:48,357
-Hello.
-Hi.

1001
01:03:48,394 --> 01:03:50,191
-Welcome back.
-Welcome back, Mr. Turner.

1002
01:03:50,229 --> 01:03:51,287
Oh, thank you.

1003
01:03:51,331 --> 01:03:53,196
Henry.

1004
01:03:53,232 --> 01:03:55,029
Hello.

1005
01:03:55,068 --> 01:03:56,365
I'm Rudy.

1006
01:03:56,402 --> 01:03:57,528
Ruuuu-dy.

1007
01:03:57,570 --> 01:04:02,030
I just want to say hello
and welcome back.

1008
01:04:02,075 --> 01:04:03,975
What's wrong with him?

1009
01:04:04,010 --> 01:04:05,307
-He's an asshole.
-Oh.

1010
01:04:05,345 --> 01:04:06,312
Henry.

1011
01:04:06,346 --> 01:04:07,472
Hi.

1012
01:04:07,513 --> 01:04:08,980
It's Linda.

1013
01:04:09,015 --> 01:04:10,312
Hi, Linda.

1014
01:04:10,350 --> 01:04:12,841
It's good to see you
back at the office.

1015
01:04:12,885 --> 01:04:15,649
It's good to see you, too.

1016
01:04:15,688 --> 01:04:18,122
Linda.

1017
01:04:18,157 --> 01:04:20,318
Linda...

1018
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:22,851
This is your office.

1019
01:04:27,367 --> 01:04:28,994
And this is...

1020
01:04:29,035 --> 01:04:30,161
Jessica.

1021
01:04:30,203 --> 01:04:32,171
Jessica.
She was your secretary.

1022
01:04:32,205 --> 01:04:35,140
And she was working for Steven
while you were away.

1023
01:04:36,376 --> 01:04:37,536
Nice flower.

1024
01:04:39,312 --> 01:04:40,643
Thank you.

1025
01:04:42,048 --> 01:04:43,538
Wow.

1026
01:04:52,525 --> 01:04:54,686
I'm at the end of the hall
if you need anything.

1027
01:04:54,727 --> 01:04:58,527
Okay, well, I'll be in here
if you need anything.

1028
01:04:58,631 --> 01:05:00,189
Let's grab lunch this week.

1029
01:05:00,233 --> 01:05:01,530
Okay.

1030
01:05:01,567 --> 01:05:03,558
He's back.

1031
01:05:03,603 --> 01:05:05,127
Grab lunch?

1032
01:05:05,171 --> 01:05:07,139
Grab lunch...

1033
01:05:07,173 --> 01:05:09,334
Grab lunch.

1034
01:05:17,183 --> 01:05:22,177
Matthews v.
East Shore Hospital.

1035
01:05:26,859 --> 01:05:28,156
Mmm.

1036
01:05:28,194 --> 01:05:30,526
Say when.

1037
01:05:37,937 --> 01:05:41,338
When you've had enough,
Mr. Turner, you say "when."

1038
01:05:43,376 --> 01:05:45,344
Oh, when.

1039
01:05:56,089 --> 01:05:59,354
You want anything
from the kitchen?

1040
01:05:59,392 --> 01:06:02,259
Um, thanks, I'm okay.

1041
01:06:04,731 --> 01:06:07,757
A little milk and cookies?

1042
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:09,358
Mallomars?

1043
01:06:09,402 --> 01:06:12,769
Uh, no, I just,
I have to finish reading this.

1044
01:06:12,805 --> 01:06:15,467
You don't remember mallomars,
do you?

1045
01:06:15,575 --> 01:06:18,100
No.

1046
01:06:18,144 --> 01:06:19,873
Marshmallows in chocolate?

1047
01:06:20,947 --> 01:06:23,643
I once watched you eat
a whole package

1048
01:06:23,683 --> 01:06:25,708
in three and a half minutes.

1049
01:06:25,752 --> 01:06:28,721
Okay, I'll have some mallomars.

1050
01:06:32,091 --> 01:06:34,252
Buddy... sit.

1051
01:06:40,566 --> 01:06:41,897
So we push for October.

1052
01:06:41,934 --> 01:06:43,333
We can go to trial then.

1053
01:06:43,369 --> 01:06:45,496
What about Lawson?

1054
01:06:45,571 --> 01:06:46,868
He's on the Barnes case.

1055
01:06:46,906 --> 01:06:48,134
How long can that take?

1056
01:06:48,174 --> 01:06:49,334
Lawson? Try a decade.

1057
01:06:49,375 --> 01:06:50,342
What did he say?

1058
01:06:50,376 --> 01:06:51,502
Nothing that helped us.

1059
01:06:51,577 --> 01:06:53,807
I'm telling you,
we've got to make a choice.

1060
01:06:53,846 --> 01:06:54,835
What, do we postpone?

1061
01:06:54,881 --> 01:06:56,439
We can't push this off forever.

1062
01:06:56,482 --> 01:06:58,347
Listen, either we get it
or we don't.

1063
01:06:58,384 --> 01:07:00,249
There's a phone call
to be made here.

1064
01:07:00,286 --> 01:07:03,813
If we lose Rodgers, half a dozen
other clients will follow.

1065
01:07:03,856 --> 01:07:06,381
We can't lose his case
because of Barnes.

1066
01:07:06,425 --> 01:07:08,825
So we go with September
with another witness.

1067
01:07:08,861 --> 01:07:10,726
Exactly. We'll pull
a Henry Turner.

1068
01:07:15,568 --> 01:07:16,899
Hey, it's really decent of you

1069
01:07:16,936 --> 01:07:19,131
to let Henry come back
like this.

1070
01:07:19,172 --> 01:07:20,400
Well, after all...

1071
01:07:20,439 --> 01:07:22,464
we're human, aren't we?

1072
01:07:22,575 --> 01:07:25,135
Is-is there more on-on

1073
01:07:25,178 --> 01:07:28,409
Matthews v. East Shore
Hospital?

1074
01:07:28,447 --> 01:07:31,644
That would be in the file room.

1075
01:07:31,684 --> 01:07:33,481
I'll get the file.

1076
01:07:33,586 --> 01:07:34,951
Okay, I'll wait here.

1077
01:07:34,987 --> 01:07:37,114
Uh...

1078
01:07:37,156 --> 01:07:39,090
you can wait in your office.

1079
01:07:39,125 --> 01:07:40,683
I'll bring it to you.

1080
01:07:40,726 --> 01:07:43,923
Okay, I'll wait in my office.

1081
01:07:46,065 --> 01:07:47,464
He's going to Paul Weiss?

1082
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:49,730
They offered him 650
and a partnership.

1083
01:07:49,769 --> 01:07:50,827
What would you do?

1084
01:07:50,870 --> 01:07:52,770
Well, I'd have
to see the office.

1085
01:07:52,805 --> 01:07:53,965
Oh, yeah.

1086
01:07:54,006 --> 01:07:55,837
Welcome back, Mr. Turner.

1087
01:07:55,875 --> 01:07:56,842
Oh, hi.

1088
01:07:56,876 --> 01:07:59,640
Listen, I've got this question.

1089
01:07:59,679 --> 01:08:00,646
What is it?

1090
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:02,705
Um... uh... in this case.

1091
01:08:02,748 --> 01:08:03,976
Which one?

1092
01:08:04,016 --> 01:08:05,074
M-Matthews.

1093
01:08:05,117 --> 01:08:08,917
East Shore Hospital,
your famous last case.

1094
01:08:08,955 --> 01:08:12,118
Yeah, yeah, we said that
the hospital wasn't responsible

1095
01:08:12,158 --> 01:08:15,355
because Mr. Matthews didn't
tell them he was a diabetic.

1096
01:08:15,394 --> 01:08:16,952
Yeah, that was the argument.

1097
01:08:16,996 --> 01:08:18,725
The hospital wasn't responsible

1098
01:08:18,764 --> 01:08:20,789
because they didn't know
the guy was on insulin.

1099
01:08:20,833 --> 01:08:26,863
Yeah, but, look, um... in this
file, um, this... other patient,

1100
01:08:26,906 --> 01:08:29,067
uh, Miss McNair,

1101
01:08:29,108 --> 01:08:31,406
uh, said that
she heard Mr. Matthews, uh

1102
01:08:31,444 --> 01:08:33,571
tell the nurse he was diabetic,

1103
01:08:33,613 --> 01:08:35,638
but-but she didn't
write it down.

1104
01:08:35,681 --> 01:08:39,640
Um, so... um, we, we're saying
they're not responsible but,

1105
01:08:39,685 --> 01:08:43,314
but we didn't tell them
about this lady's statement.

1106
01:08:43,356 --> 01:08:44,380
So what?

1107
01:08:44,423 --> 01:08:46,323
Come on, Henry.
Put it away.

1108
01:08:46,359 --> 01:08:47,986
Put it back in the file.

1109
01:08:48,027 --> 01:08:51,224
But, so...

1110
01:08:53,566 --> 01:08:56,034
What we did was wrong.

1111
01:08:56,068 --> 01:08:59,868
What we did is paying
for our lunch.

1112
01:09:02,975 --> 01:09:03,043
So everything's okay?

1113
01:09:03,043 --> 01:09:04,943
So everything's okay?

1114
01:09:04,978 --> 01:09:06,275
Still love me?

1115
01:09:06,312 --> 01:09:08,337
Yeah. When are you coming home?

1116
01:09:08,381 --> 01:09:10,679
Uh, I'll be home by dinner.

1117
01:09:10,717 --> 01:09:12,981
Don't spoil your appetite.

1118
01:09:13,019 --> 01:09:16,386
Okay, you, too. Bye-bye.

1119
01:09:16,423 --> 01:09:20,018
"Mix until... creamy.

1120
01:09:20,060 --> 01:09:25,896
"Drop... spoonfuls on...

1121
01:09:25,932 --> 01:09:29,732
greas-ed... cookie sheet."

1122
01:09:29,769 --> 01:09:31,964
Let's make one big cookie.

1123
01:09:32,005 --> 01:09:33,700
You can't.
It doesn't cook.

1124
01:09:33,740 --> 01:09:34,764
I tried it once.

1125
01:09:34,808 --> 01:09:36,537
Oh.

1126
01:09:44,317 --> 01:09:48,344
Were you scared...
at the hospital?

1127
01:09:48,388 --> 01:09:50,982
Um...
at first, yeah.

1128
01:09:51,024 --> 01:09:54,482
But then it got okay, right?

1129
01:09:54,594 --> 01:09:57,188
Yeah, then it got okay.

1130
01:09:57,230 --> 01:09:59,630
'Cause I start school soon.

1131
01:09:59,666 --> 01:10:01,964
Sleep-away.

1132
01:10:02,001 --> 01:10:04,492
What-what do you mean?

1133
01:10:04,571 --> 01:10:07,438
I'm going away.

1134
01:10:07,474 --> 01:10:08,441
Wh...?

1135
01:10:08,475 --> 01:10:12,741
Well, no... no one... told me.

1136
01:10:14,614 --> 01:10:17,139
Are you scared?

1137
01:10:19,085 --> 01:10:21,485
Do you still want me to go?

1138
01:10:21,521 --> 01:10:22,510
Me? No, I...

1139
01:10:22,589 --> 01:10:25,524
No, l-l, no.

1140
01:10:25,558 --> 01:10:26,820
Really, 'cause I could,

1141
01:10:26,860 --> 01:10:28,657
I could go to school
around here.

1142
01:10:28,695 --> 01:10:32,825
Well, I don't want you
to go anywhere, but...

1143
01:10:34,300 --> 01:10:37,360
I'm not sure it's up to me.

1144
01:10:37,403 --> 01:10:39,132
Is it up to me?

1145
01:10:43,676 --> 01:10:46,839
Well, look,
I'll-I'll talk to Mom, okay?

1146
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:49,178
Okay.

1147
01:10:49,215 --> 01:10:51,274
Okay.

1148
01:10:51,317 --> 01:10:54,718
Maybe she could... stay home,

1149
01:10:54,754 --> 01:10:57,222
and-and go to school
somewhere around here.

1150
01:10:57,257 --> 01:10:58,849
It's what we agreed on.

1151
01:10:58,892 --> 01:11:01,417
That school only takes
30 kids a year,

1152
01:11:01,461 --> 01:11:03,190
and Rachel's one of them.

1153
01:11:08,635 --> 01:11:10,660
There's got to be a few things

1154
01:11:10,703 --> 01:11:13,228
that we decided
that I can count on.

1155
01:11:13,273 --> 01:11:17,266
It's a great opportunity
for her.

1156
01:11:17,310 --> 01:11:19,210
And for us.

1157
01:11:19,979 --> 01:11:22,607
I think it's important.

1158
01:11:26,252 --> 01:11:28,516
I...

1159
01:11:28,621 --> 01:11:30,782
I saw a house today.

1160
01:11:30,823 --> 01:11:33,018
A place I think'd be
much better for us.

1161
01:11:33,059 --> 01:11:34,993
It's so big here,
don't you think?

1162
01:11:36,963 --> 01:11:39,864
I found someone who wants
to buy this apartment.

1163
01:11:39,899 --> 01:11:41,958
And I want to show you
this house.

1164
01:11:46,673 --> 01:11:48,766
You think we should move?

1165
01:11:50,310 --> 01:11:51,743
I do.

1166
01:11:55,348 --> 01:11:59,409
And you think Rachel
should go a-away to school?

1167
01:12:00,820 --> 01:12:02,310
Yeah.

1168
01:12:08,027 --> 01:12:10,393
Okay.

1169
01:12:36,823 --> 01:12:38,290
Oh...

1170
01:12:38,324 --> 01:12:40,292
Hi, Rachel.

1171
01:12:40,326 --> 01:12:41,759
Hi, Jennifer.

1172
01:12:41,794 --> 01:12:43,694
Sweetheart.

1173
01:12:43,730 --> 01:12:45,698
This is
a wonderful school.

1174
01:12:45,732 --> 01:12:48,724
And see, you already
have a friend here.

1175
01:12:48,768 --> 01:12:50,292
I hate Jennifer.

1176
01:12:50,336 --> 01:12:53,772
You're going to meet all sorts
of very nice girls.

1177
01:12:53,806 --> 01:12:55,000
I don't think so.

1178
01:12:55,041 --> 01:12:57,202
Of course, you are.

1179
01:12:57,243 --> 01:12:58,540
Honey.

1180
01:12:58,611 --> 01:13:02,479
One of the things I do remember

1181
01:13:02,515 --> 01:13:06,144
is-is my first day at school.

1182
01:13:06,185 --> 01:13:10,087
There were all these...
weird-looking kids,

1183
01:13:10,123 --> 01:13:12,091
and I didn't know any of them,

1184
01:13:12,125 --> 01:13:15,424
and they didn't know me,
I was-I was scared.

1185
01:13:15,461 --> 01:13:18,021
But after two days,

1186
01:13:18,064 --> 01:13:22,831
we were all laughing
about-about how scared we were.

1187
01:13:22,869 --> 01:13:27,238
Everybody feels like you do,
honey, everybody.

1188
01:13:30,543 --> 01:13:32,977
Take care of Buddy.

1189
01:13:33,012 --> 01:13:34,377
I will.

1190
01:13:34,414 --> 01:13:37,747
Try and teach him
how to sit, okay?

1191
01:13:37,784 --> 01:13:38,716
Okay.

1192
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:43,718
Well...

1193
01:13:43,756 --> 01:13:46,281
you don't want
to miss orientation.

1194
01:13:51,764 --> 01:13:55,291
Henry. That's great.

1195
01:13:55,335 --> 01:13:57,303
I didn't know you
remembered your school.

1196
01:13:59,172 --> 01:14:01,333
I don't.

1197
01:14:42,749 --> 01:14:44,444
Hey.

1198
01:14:44,484 --> 01:14:46,782
How you doing?

1199
01:14:46,819 --> 01:14:49,481
Hmm. I miss her.

1200
01:14:49,522 --> 01:14:51,922
Mmm...

1201
01:14:53,726 --> 01:14:56,820
Me, too.

1202
01:14:59,365 --> 01:15:02,129
We'll see her on Parent's Day.

1203
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:10,375
Look, there's Cassiopeia.

1204
01:15:10,410 --> 01:15:15,404
And...

1205
01:15:15,448 --> 01:15:18,474
there's the Big Dripper.

1206
01:15:18,518 --> 01:15:21,419
And the Little Dripper.

1207
01:15:23,756 --> 01:15:25,246
Hmm.

1208
01:15:25,291 --> 01:15:27,350
So strange,
the things I remember.

1209
01:15:37,336 --> 01:15:40,328
Is this okay?

1210
01:15:40,373 --> 01:15:42,637
Yeah.

1211
01:15:46,045 --> 01:15:50,243
You know,
since you've come home,

1212
01:15:50,283 --> 01:15:52,251
we haven't made love.

1213
01:15:54,454 --> 01:15:59,357
I mean, if you're nervous
or something,

1214
01:15:59,392 --> 01:16:01,383
we could talk about it.

1215
01:16:01,427 --> 01:16:05,363
Well, yeah,
I'm a little... nervous.

1216
01:16:05,398 --> 01:16:09,664
Um, okay, well, re...

1217
01:16:11,204 --> 01:16:13,434
Really nervous.

1218
01:16:14,507 --> 01:16:16,975
Very nervous.

1219
01:16:17,009 --> 01:16:18,601
Why?

1220
01:16:18,644 --> 01:16:21,306
Well, um...

1221
01:16:21,347 --> 01:16:24,282
I don't know, I...

1222
01:16:25,451 --> 01:16:28,443
Look, I saw...

1223
01:16:28,488 --> 01:16:30,285
I saw this movie, and...

1224
01:16:30,323 --> 01:16:35,090
Well, I don't know if-if I can
do it like that guy did it.

1225
01:16:38,130 --> 01:16:39,995
Here.

1226
01:16:48,241 --> 01:16:49,902
Touch me.

1227
01:17:41,661 --> 01:17:43,151
Sarah?

1228
01:17:43,195 --> 01:17:44,992
Mm-hmm?

1229
01:17:45,031 --> 01:17:47,556
Tell me how we met.

1230
01:17:53,406 --> 01:17:55,772
Uh...

1231
01:17:55,808 --> 01:18:01,041
it was at Chris Liner's
birthday party.

1232
01:18:01,080 --> 01:18:05,449
You were a hot, young lawyer,

1233
01:18:05,551 --> 01:18:11,854
and I was answering phones
at Harper's Bazaar.

1234
01:18:11,891 --> 01:18:15,554
I was standing in the doorway
smoking a cigarette...

1235
01:18:15,595 --> 01:18:17,563
back when I used to smoke...

1236
01:18:17,597 --> 01:18:23,627
and you just came up to me.

1237
01:18:23,669 --> 01:18:27,901
"I'm Henry," you said,
"and you're beautiful."

1238
01:18:29,508 --> 01:18:33,069
I did?

1239
01:18:33,112 --> 01:18:37,344
That made me completely
self-conscious.

1240
01:18:37,383 --> 01:18:43,322
You had such confidence,
you just drew me in.

1241
01:18:43,356 --> 01:18:45,722
We talked for hours.

1242
01:18:45,758 --> 01:18:47,783
Ignored everyone.

1243
01:18:47,827 --> 01:18:51,490
And then the girl
you were with got mad

1244
01:18:51,597 --> 01:18:53,258
and wanted to go.

1245
01:18:53,299 --> 01:18:54,891
And as you left,

1246
01:18:54,934 --> 01:18:58,165
you handed me your card
and said,

1247
01:18:58,204 --> 01:19:01,139
"Have you ever eaten blowfish?

1248
01:19:01,173 --> 01:19:05,769
'Cause I know this great
blowfish place."

1249
01:19:11,317 --> 01:19:14,684
It made me laugh...

1250
01:19:17,023 --> 01:19:19,321
and I went home
and told my roommate

1251
01:19:19,358 --> 01:19:21,986
I'd met the man
I was going to marry.

1252
01:20:00,599 --> 01:20:02,965
I like it.

1253
01:20:18,284 --> 01:20:19,911
Hey, watch where you're walking.

1254
01:20:21,721 --> 01:20:25,248
...in the living room,
next to the couch.

1255
01:20:25,291 --> 01:20:27,816
We'll get to keep the dining
room table, right?

1256
01:20:27,860 --> 01:20:29,088
Right, right.

1257
01:20:29,128 --> 01:20:30,459
Okay.

1258
01:20:30,496 --> 01:20:32,191
What?

1259
01:20:32,231 --> 01:20:33,823
Does this bother you?

1260
01:20:33,866 --> 01:20:35,060
No.

1261
01:20:35,101 --> 01:20:37,296
Then why are you looking
at me like that?

1262
01:20:37,336 --> 01:20:40,533
Because you never
used to hold my hand.

1263
01:20:40,606 --> 01:20:42,540
Oh.

1264
01:20:42,575 --> 01:20:44,475
You didn't like showing
affection in public.

1265
01:20:44,510 --> 01:20:45,636
It bothered you.

1266
01:20:45,678 --> 01:20:46,645
Why?

1267
01:20:46,679 --> 01:20:47,976
I don't know why.

1268
01:20:48,013 --> 01:20:49,537
You don't know why?

1269
01:20:49,615 --> 01:20:51,139
No.

1270
01:20:51,183 --> 01:20:52,548
Me, either.

1271
01:20:54,820 --> 01:20:55,980
What are you doing?

1272
01:20:56,021 --> 01:20:56,988
Come up here.

1273
01:20:57,022 --> 01:20:58,250
Henry, what?

1274
01:20:58,290 --> 01:20:59,780
Come here.

1275
01:20:59,825 --> 01:21:03,317
I don't mind so much anymore.

1276
01:21:03,362 --> 01:21:06,490
Sarah?

1277
01:21:06,532 --> 01:21:09,831
Phyllis, hi.

1278
01:21:11,437 --> 01:21:12,495
Hi.

1279
01:21:12,605 --> 01:21:14,630
I thought that was you.

1280
01:21:14,673 --> 01:21:16,300
Hello, Henry.

1281
01:21:16,342 --> 01:21:17,832
Hi.

1282
01:21:17,877 --> 01:21:19,504
This is Phyllis and Daniel.

1283
01:21:19,545 --> 01:21:21,274
They were at Charlie's party.

1284
01:21:21,313 --> 01:21:22,905
Hello, Phyllis and Daniel.

1285
01:21:22,948 --> 01:21:24,347
Henry.

1286
01:21:24,383 --> 01:21:27,716
Well, um, no, l,
I was going to call you,

1287
01:21:27,753 --> 01:21:30,916
because, I'm having
a-a housewarming on the 20th.

1288
01:21:30,956 --> 01:21:32,514
I'd love it if you'd come.

1289
01:21:32,558 --> 01:21:33,820
Okay.

1290
01:21:33,859 --> 01:21:36,191
Okay, thanks.

1291
01:21:36,228 --> 01:21:38,822
All right, then, uh, we'll talk.

1292
01:21:38,864 --> 01:21:40,991
It's good to see you.

1293
01:21:41,033 --> 01:21:42,967
I'll call you.

1294
01:21:43,002 --> 01:21:44,526
Big kiss.

1295
01:21:44,570 --> 01:21:46,629
Okay.

1296
01:22:05,558 --> 01:22:10,962
Jessica, I'd like to see the
file on Stephenson v. Murray.

1297
01:22:12,631 --> 01:22:14,622
I'm sorry, Mr. Turner, I can't.

1298
01:22:14,667 --> 01:22:17,602
How come?

1299
01:22:20,339 --> 01:22:25,038
I'm not allowed to give you
any more of your old case files.

1300
01:22:37,489 --> 01:22:40,151
No one can believe
what you've done.

1301
01:22:40,192 --> 01:22:42,990
I just moved in
everything that I love.

1302
01:22:43,028 --> 01:22:44,427
It's amazing.

1303
01:22:44,463 --> 01:22:46,795
I said, "I don't even want to
see swatches for six months."

1304
01:22:46,832 --> 01:22:47,958
You're kidding me.

1305
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:49,934
I mean, it looks like
you've lived here forever.

1306
01:22:49,969 --> 01:22:51,630
Just all my old
favorite things.

1307
01:22:51,670 --> 01:22:52,728
A hundred?

1308
01:22:52,771 --> 01:22:54,796
I think this is the nicest
house you've ever had.

1309
01:22:54,840 --> 01:22:57,468
I agree.
I feel like I'm home.

1310
01:22:59,578 --> 01:23:00,545
Hi.

1311
01:23:00,613 --> 01:23:01,944
Hello, darling.
How's Henry?

1312
01:23:01,981 --> 01:23:03,141
Oh, he's fine, he's here.

1313
01:23:03,182 --> 01:23:04,171
Marvelous.

1314
01:23:07,486 --> 01:23:10,114
Seven brothers
and sisters, huh?

1315
01:23:10,155 --> 01:23:11,122
That's right.

1316
01:23:11,156 --> 01:23:12,418
Is it really hot in Memphis?

1317
01:23:12,458 --> 01:23:13,425
Very hot.

1318
01:23:13,459 --> 01:23:15,120
Hey, how you doing?

1319
01:23:15,160 --> 01:23:17,720
Well, these little ones
are really good.

1320
01:23:17,763 --> 01:23:20,323
But that lady over there
in the gold dress

1321
01:23:20,366 --> 01:23:22,027
thinks they're a disaster.

1322
01:23:22,067 --> 01:23:24,501
And that other woman
n-near the window?

1323
01:23:24,536 --> 01:23:26,003
Mm-hmm?

1324
01:23:26,038 --> 01:23:27,505
Just had her face done.

1325
01:23:27,539 --> 01:23:29,439
Not her neck, just her eyes.

1326
01:23:29,475 --> 01:23:33,377
And that other man
used to be her husband,

1327
01:23:33,412 --> 01:23:36,870
but who is she kidding,
the damage is done.

1328
01:23:39,518 --> 01:23:40,485
Such a shame.

1329
01:23:40,519 --> 01:23:41,508
I mean, he was so good.

1330
01:23:41,553 --> 01:23:42,679
He really was.

1331
01:23:42,721 --> 01:23:44,814
Henry represented my cousin
three years ago.

1332
01:23:44,857 --> 01:23:46,449
He was the best, the best.

1333
01:23:46,492 --> 01:23:48,187
Everybody was terrified of him.

1334
01:23:48,227 --> 01:23:50,320
Of course,
I've known Sarah forever.

1335
01:23:50,362 --> 01:23:52,057
I heard he's back at work.

1336
01:23:52,097 --> 01:23:53,689
Yeah, but doing what?

1337
01:23:53,732 --> 01:23:57,133
Getting paid for doing nothing
doesn't sound so bad, does it?

1338
01:23:57,169 --> 01:23:59,433
It's not Henry I feel sorry for,
it's Sarah.

1339
01:23:59,471 --> 01:24:01,200
It's like
she's got two kids now.

1340
01:24:01,240 --> 01:24:02,639
Worse! What does
she possibly have

1341
01:24:02,675 --> 01:24:03,699
to look forward to?

1342
01:24:03,742 --> 01:24:04,834
It is such a shame.

1343
01:24:04,877 --> 01:24:06,401
Christ, one minute
you're an attorney,

1344
01:24:06,445 --> 01:24:07,571
the next, you're an imbecile.

1345
01:24:07,613 --> 01:24:09,774
That's not a very long trip.

1346
01:24:15,654 --> 01:24:21,593
Phyllis, I am afraid we, uh,
we can't stay for dinner.

1347
01:24:21,627 --> 01:24:23,185
I just wanted
to say goodnight.

1348
01:24:23,228 --> 01:24:24,627
Thank you.

1349
01:24:28,801 --> 01:24:30,325
Shit!

1350
01:24:49,355 --> 01:24:53,086
You can't let them
hurt you, those people.

1351
01:24:53,125 --> 01:24:56,720
They don't know you anymore.

1352
01:24:56,762 --> 01:24:59,322
Darling...

1353
01:24:59,365 --> 01:25:02,926
I'm not going to work today.

1354
01:25:14,647 --> 01:25:17,275
Sit.

1355
01:25:32,198 --> 01:25:33,495
Henry.

1356
01:25:33,533 --> 01:25:36,263
I invited someone over.

1357
01:25:43,209 --> 01:25:45,939
Bradley.

1358
01:25:51,851 --> 01:25:54,012
Oh, dinner.

1359
01:25:54,053 --> 01:25:56,112
Thanks.

1360
01:26:08,201 --> 01:26:10,567
So... what's up?

1361
01:26:15,141 --> 01:26:20,636
I thought I could go back
to my life, but...

1362
01:26:20,680 --> 01:26:24,411
I don't like
who I was, Bradley.

1363
01:26:24,450 --> 01:26:27,578
l-I don't fit in.

1364
01:26:32,992 --> 01:26:35,153
I got bad knees.

1365
01:26:35,194 --> 01:26:37,321
What?

1366
01:26:37,363 --> 01:26:39,024
My knees, they're bad.

1367
01:26:39,065 --> 01:26:40,999
Ask me why.

1368
01:26:41,033 --> 01:26:43,297
Why?

1369
01:26:43,336 --> 01:26:44,928
Football.

1370
01:26:44,971 --> 01:26:47,439
Wrecked them both
playing college football.

1371
01:26:47,473 --> 01:26:51,500
Man, it was my life.

1372
01:26:51,544 --> 01:26:53,512
Football, what else was there?

1373
01:26:53,579 --> 01:26:55,672
Not jack shit.

1374
01:26:55,715 --> 01:26:58,206
Homecoming, right?

1375
01:26:58,251 --> 01:27:01,243
That son of a bitch
threw a perfect spiral,

1376
01:27:01,287 --> 01:27:04,586
and I caught it... boom.

1377
01:27:04,624 --> 01:27:06,455
Right out of the sky.

1378
01:27:06,526 --> 01:27:08,551
I had the moment.

1379
01:27:08,594 --> 01:27:13,361
When that safety hit me,
and I felt my knees pop,

1380
01:27:13,399 --> 01:27:15,867
I knew that was it.

1381
01:27:15,902 --> 01:27:17,631
Game over. Forget it.

1382
01:27:17,670 --> 01:27:20,195
I was dead.

1383
01:27:20,239 --> 01:27:22,207
My life was over, Hank.

1384
01:27:25,211 --> 01:27:29,238
Now ask me if I mind
having bad knees?

1385
01:27:29,282 --> 01:27:31,182
Do you mind...?

1386
01:27:31,217 --> 01:27:33,344
No. No way.

1387
01:27:33,386 --> 01:27:35,911
It was a test.

1388
01:27:35,955 --> 01:27:39,686
I had to find a life.

1389
01:27:41,527 --> 01:27:43,825
The therapist that
helped me walk again?

1390
01:27:43,863 --> 01:27:45,160
He was so cool.

1391
01:27:45,198 --> 01:27:48,998
I thought, "That's
what I want to do."

1392
01:27:49,035 --> 01:27:52,664
When I told some of my buddies,
they laughed right in my face.

1393
01:27:52,705 --> 01:27:53,865
Called me a nurse.

1394
01:27:53,906 --> 01:27:55,999
Bought me white dresses
and shit.

1395
01:27:56,042 --> 01:27:59,978
But check it out.

1396
01:28:00,012 --> 01:28:02,572
You're walking.

1397
01:28:02,615 --> 01:28:04,344
You're talking.

1398
01:28:04,383 --> 01:28:07,978
You're sitting here drinking
some pretty expensive damn beer.

1399
01:28:08,020 --> 01:28:09,988
I had something
to do with that.

1400
01:28:10,022 --> 01:28:13,287
If it weren't for my knees,
I'd never have met you.

1401
01:28:13,326 --> 01:28:17,888
So no, I don't mind
having bad knees, no.

1402
01:28:17,930 --> 01:28:21,229
Let me tell you something, Hank.

1403
01:28:21,267 --> 01:28:25,465
Don't listen to nobody
trying to tell you who you are.

1404
01:28:25,538 --> 01:28:31,340
It might take a while,
but you'll figure yourself out.

1405
01:28:35,715 --> 01:28:37,808
Thanks.

1406
01:28:51,898 --> 01:28:55,231
It'd be a great story
if we'd won the game.

1407
01:29:00,873 --> 01:29:04,434
Yeah, hi, this is
Rachel Turner's father.

1408
01:29:04,477 --> 01:29:07,378
I want to talk
to Rachel, please.

1409
01:29:07,413 --> 01:29:12,009
Well, I'm not sure
it's an emergency,

1410
01:29:12,051 --> 01:29:15,680
but I just got this letter
from her, and she's...

1411
01:29:15,721 --> 01:29:17,348
m-miserable.

1412
01:29:19,625 --> 01:29:23,561
Yeah, but she just sounds
so sad.

1413
01:29:23,596 --> 01:29:26,190
I just thought I could,
I don't know,

1414
01:29:26,232 --> 01:29:29,599
cheer her up
a little or something.

1415
01:29:29,635 --> 01:29:33,935
Yeah, I see. Uh-huh.

1416
01:29:33,973 --> 01:29:35,941
Okay, yeah.

1417
01:29:35,975 --> 01:29:38,466
I'll-I'll call back,
um, after 6:00.

1418
01:29:38,544 --> 01:29:40,978
Thank you.

1419
01:29:41,013 --> 01:29:44,039
This is for you, Mr. Henry.

1420
01:29:44,083 --> 01:29:45,573
Oh.

1421
01:29:45,618 --> 01:29:47,813
Thanks.

1422
01:29:51,223 --> 01:29:54,021
I'm going to miss you,
Mr. Henry.

1423
01:29:54,060 --> 01:29:56,927
I like you
much better now.

1424
01:30:14,080 --> 01:30:17,846
"Enjoy your new home.

1425
01:30:17,883 --> 01:30:22,513
Your friend and partner, Bruce."

1426
01:31:06,298 --> 01:31:14,330
"Sarah, I need you... now.

1427
01:31:14,373 --> 01:31:17,171
"Feel you...

1428
01:31:17,209 --> 01:31:19,541
"against me.

1429
01:31:21,547 --> 01:31:23,208
"Call me tonight.

1430
01:31:28,554 --> 01:31:30,954
Bruce."

1431
01:31:30,990 --> 01:31:33,925
Henry, you back here?

1432
01:31:36,128 --> 01:31:37,527
We closed.

1433
01:31:37,630 --> 01:31:38,892
It's ours.

1434
01:31:38,931 --> 01:31:41,126
The house
is officially ours.

1435
01:31:45,304 --> 01:31:48,102
Oh, God.

1436
01:31:48,140 --> 01:31:49,937
Oh, my God.

1437
01:31:49,975 --> 01:31:52,170
Henry.

1438
01:31:52,211 --> 01:31:55,339
It happened before?

1439
01:31:59,318 --> 01:32:01,718
Oh, God, please...

1440
01:32:06,692 --> 01:32:08,819
Before I was shot?

1441
01:32:08,861 --> 01:32:10,829
You slept with Bruce before?

1442
01:32:10,863 --> 01:32:14,264
It didn't last.

1443
01:32:14,300 --> 01:32:17,167
He kept writing to me,
but it didn't last.

1444
01:32:17,203 --> 01:32:20,229
Everything was different.

1445
01:32:20,272 --> 01:32:22,263
You were different.

1446
01:32:22,308 --> 01:32:23,935
I don't remember
what I was like, Sarah!

1447
01:32:23,976 --> 01:32:26,410
Listen to me.

1448
01:32:26,445 --> 01:32:28,003
Don't walk away.

1449
01:32:28,047 --> 01:32:30,140
We were miserable.

1450
01:32:30,182 --> 01:32:33,015
You don't remember,
but I do.

1451
01:32:33,052 --> 01:32:35,179
I was lonely.

1452
01:32:40,259 --> 01:32:42,853
We were in love once,
years ago,

1453
01:32:42,895 --> 01:32:45,363
and then we weren't,
not for a long time.

1454
01:32:45,397 --> 01:32:49,197
But we're better now.

1455
01:32:49,235 --> 01:32:51,260
Please don't walk away.

1456
01:32:51,303 --> 01:32:54,739
Not now.

1457
01:33:05,284 --> 01:33:07,650
Well, I would like to.

1458
01:33:07,686 --> 01:33:09,483
Could you do that?

1459
01:33:09,522 --> 01:33:11,319
You could?

1460
01:33:11,357 --> 01:33:13,518
I think that would be
perfect.

1461
01:33:15,194 --> 01:33:17,128
Wait a minute,
I'll call you back.

1462
01:33:31,377 --> 01:33:32,674
Please.

1463
01:33:32,711 --> 01:33:34,178
Please.

1464
01:33:34,213 --> 01:33:35,942
Talk to me.

1465
01:33:44,557 --> 01:33:46,548
Taxi!

1466
01:33:59,405 --> 01:34:00,895
Afternoon.

1467
01:34:45,884 --> 01:34:47,181
I followed you.

1468
01:34:47,219 --> 01:34:48,686
Bruce doesn't know I'm here.

1469
01:34:48,721 --> 01:34:52,680
Look, I...
I don't have anything to say.

1470
01:34:52,725 --> 01:34:55,193
I think we should talk.

1471
01:34:55,227 --> 01:34:57,388
Well, I don't.

1472
01:34:57,429 --> 01:34:59,329
Bruce was right,
you are different.

1473
01:35:00,899 --> 01:35:02,924
You shouldn't take it all out
on him.

1474
01:35:02,968 --> 01:35:04,765
He's been a good friend to you.

1475
01:35:04,803 --> 01:35:07,465
After the accident,
Bruce took over your cases.

1476
01:35:07,506 --> 01:35:08,803
He took care of things.

1477
01:35:08,841 --> 01:35:10,468
He sure did.

1478
01:35:10,576 --> 01:35:12,669
Bruce is so humiliated.

1479
01:35:12,711 --> 01:35:14,201
He's humiliated?

1480
01:35:14,246 --> 01:35:18,148
Look, Linda, I know Bruce
is a friend of yours and I...

1481
01:35:18,183 --> 01:35:20,981
I know that you mean well,
but this...

1482
01:35:21,020 --> 01:35:23,454
this is not a good time for me.

1483
01:35:23,489 --> 01:35:26,083
Henry this isn't any fun
for me either.

1484
01:35:26,125 --> 01:35:27,820
What are you talking about?

1485
01:35:28,861 --> 01:35:31,227
I'm talking about us.

1486
01:35:31,263 --> 01:35:34,994
You're not the only one
who lost in this.

1487
01:35:35,034 --> 01:35:37,195
I lost, too.

1488
01:35:38,203 --> 01:35:41,832
I lost the one man I ever loved.

1489
01:35:41,874 --> 01:35:43,842
And it was you, Henry.

1490
01:35:47,313 --> 01:35:52,012
It's hard to see you every day
in the office...

1491
01:35:52,051 --> 01:35:54,713
and you don't know me.

1492
01:35:57,556 --> 01:36:00,184
This was our hotel.

1493
01:36:00,225 --> 01:36:03,956
Every Tuesday and Thursday
at the Ritz.

1494
01:36:03,996 --> 01:36:07,159
But...

1495
01:36:09,335 --> 01:36:12,429
Ritz.

1496
01:36:12,471 --> 01:36:15,133
You were going to leave Sarah
for me.

1497
01:36:15,174 --> 01:36:17,301
And now it's gone.

1498
01:36:17,343 --> 01:36:20,176
No...
It's all gone.

1499
01:36:23,615 --> 01:36:25,913
Henry?

1500
01:36:25,951 --> 01:36:27,782
No...

1501
01:38:21,166 --> 01:38:22,963
Mrs. Matthews?

1502
01:38:23,001 --> 01:38:24,798
May I help...?

1503
01:38:24,836 --> 01:38:27,031
What are you doing here?

1504
01:38:28,073 --> 01:38:30,837
You remember me.

1505
01:38:30,876 --> 01:38:35,142
We remember you,
Mr. Turner.

1506
01:38:35,180 --> 01:38:37,307
I came to apologize.

1507
01:38:37,349 --> 01:38:39,146
Are you kidding me?

1508
01:38:39,184 --> 01:38:41,175
No, I'm serious.

1509
01:38:41,219 --> 01:38:42,447
Um...

1510
01:38:48,026 --> 01:38:50,290
Just give that to your lawyer.

1511
01:38:50,328 --> 01:38:53,024
What's this?

1512
01:38:54,065 --> 01:38:56,932
Your husband did tell the nurse

1513
01:38:56,968 --> 01:38:59,368
that-that he was diabetic.

1514
01:38:59,404 --> 01:39:01,531
It-it's all in there.

1515
01:39:03,475 --> 01:39:05,443
I'm sorry.

1516
01:39:05,477 --> 01:39:07,274
Why?

1517
01:39:07,312 --> 01:39:08,939
I changed.

1518
01:39:08,980 --> 01:39:11,744
I guess.

1519
01:39:11,783 --> 01:39:13,842
Bye.

1520
01:39:31,903 --> 01:39:32,961
Hi, Ann.

1521
01:39:33,004 --> 01:39:34,471
Mr. Turner,
he's in a meeting.

1522
01:39:34,506 --> 01:39:36,872
It's okay.

1523
01:39:36,908 --> 01:39:38,136
Got to go.

1524
01:39:38,176 --> 01:39:39,837
Jesus Christ.

1525
01:39:39,878 --> 01:39:41,971
Excuse me.

1526
01:39:42,013 --> 01:39:45,346
Charlie, I just came
to say good-bye.

1527
01:39:45,383 --> 01:39:46,475
Fine, Henry.

1528
01:39:46,518 --> 01:39:47,815
We'll see you tomorrow.

1529
01:39:47,852 --> 01:39:50,980
Uh... no, Charlie.

1530
01:39:51,022 --> 01:39:54,321
I can't be a lawyer anymore.

1531
01:39:54,359 --> 01:39:55,485
Thank you.

1532
01:39:55,527 --> 01:39:57,290
You've been really good to me.

1533
01:40:04,536 --> 01:40:05,662
Just wait.

1534
01:40:05,704 --> 01:40:08,002
We'll talk about this.

1535
01:40:08,039 --> 01:40:09,165
I can't wait.

1536
01:40:09,207 --> 01:40:10,504
Good-bye.

1537
01:40:10,542 --> 01:40:12,840
Well, good luck.

1538
01:40:12,877 --> 01:40:14,174
Mr. Cameron.

1539
01:40:14,212 --> 01:40:16,680
I have the Matthews' lawyer
on line three.

1540
01:40:16,715 --> 01:40:19,707
Good luck to you too,
Charlie.

1541
01:40:24,889 --> 01:40:27,221
Good-bye, Jessica.

1542
01:40:28,393 --> 01:40:30,054
Mr. Turner, what happened?

1543
01:40:30,095 --> 01:40:31,858
Well...

1544
01:40:31,896 --> 01:40:35,696
I had enough, so I said "when."

1545
01:40:38,069 --> 01:40:39,900
Good for you.

1546
01:40:41,239 --> 01:40:42,570
Bye.

1547
01:40:50,548 --> 01:40:52,880
Good-bye, Linda.

1548
01:41:05,764 --> 01:41:09,427
I know this great
blowfish place.

1549
01:41:16,207 --> 01:41:17,674
Henry...

1550
01:41:17,709 --> 01:41:20,507
I'm sorry.

1551
01:41:20,578 --> 01:41:23,012
No, I'm sorry.

1552
01:41:23,048 --> 01:41:25,175
You were right.

1553
01:41:25,216 --> 01:41:27,241
Things were different.

1554
01:41:27,285 --> 01:41:31,051
Oh, Henry.

1555
01:41:39,964 --> 01:41:43,866
There's something
I need to tell you.

1556
01:41:43,902 --> 01:41:46,393
What is it?

1557
01:41:48,073 --> 01:41:51,042
I don't like my clothes.

1558
01:41:51,076 --> 01:41:53,306
Maybe they used
to be my favorites,

1559
01:41:53,345 --> 01:41:56,280
but I don't feel
comfortable in them anymore.

1560
01:41:57,315 --> 01:41:59,909
We'll get you new clothes.

1561
01:42:00,919 --> 01:42:02,978
I'm not done.

1562
01:42:03,021 --> 01:42:05,182
Eggs.

1563
01:42:06,524 --> 01:42:08,321
I don't like eggs.

1564
01:42:08,360 --> 01:42:11,022
Or steak.

1565
01:42:12,197 --> 01:42:14,995
And, Sarah...

1566
01:42:15,033 --> 01:42:17,331
I hate being a lawyer.

1567
01:42:17,369 --> 01:42:20,133
I quit
and I told Charlie good-bye.

1568
01:42:21,539 --> 01:42:24,667
Whatever you want is fine.

1569
01:42:24,709 --> 01:42:28,008
I want us to be a family.

1570
01:42:28,046 --> 01:42:31,174
For as long as we can, Sarah.

1571
01:42:31,216 --> 01:42:34,379
For as long as we can.

1572
01:42:36,554 --> 01:42:38,681
I love you.

1573
01:42:38,723 --> 01:42:40,554
Oh, I love you, too.

1574
01:42:45,563 --> 01:42:49,329
I did like those mallomars,
though.

1575
01:42:55,573 --> 01:42:58,940
And you're all learning
what that means

1576
01:42:58,977 --> 01:43:02,003
when you ask yourself,
"Why do I push myself?

1577
01:43:02,046 --> 01:43:05,482
"Why do I strive to be
a harder worker?

1578
01:43:05,517 --> 01:43:07,382
A better listener?"

1579
01:43:07,419 --> 01:43:09,182
Well, look around you.

1580
01:43:09,220 --> 01:43:12,485
There are the answers
to those questions.

1581
01:43:12,524 --> 01:43:14,856
Competition.

1582
01:43:14,893 --> 01:43:17,691
Everyone, close your eyes.

1583
01:43:18,863 --> 01:43:22,264
Repeat to yourself silently:

1584
01:43:22,300 --> 01:43:27,863
"I will work harder."

1585
01:43:28,873 --> 01:43:30,841
"I will listen better."

1586
01:43:30,875 --> 01:43:32,137
Buddy?

1587
01:43:41,052 --> 01:43:43,145
You taught Buddy to sit.

1588
01:43:44,556 --> 01:43:46,820
Mr. Turner.

1589
01:43:46,858 --> 01:43:49,019
We're in the middle
of a session.

1590
01:43:49,060 --> 01:43:50,357
I know.

1591
01:43:50,395 --> 01:43:53,523
I'm... I'm sorry to interrupt.

1592
01:43:53,565 --> 01:43:55,556
I...

1593
01:43:56,568 --> 01:44:00,197
I missed her first 1 1 years,
and...

1594
01:44:00,238 --> 01:44:03,605
and-and I don't want to miss
anymore.

1595
01:44:03,641 --> 01:44:07,577
It's good to see you doing
so well, Mr. Turner.

1596
01:44:07,612 --> 01:44:08,636
Thank you.

1597
01:44:08,680 --> 01:44:10,511
Excuse us.

1598
01:44:14,185 --> 01:44:15,482
Come on, honey.

1599
01:44:15,520 --> 01:44:16,851
Let's go home.

1600
01:44:21,726 --> 01:44:23,523
Hi, honey.
