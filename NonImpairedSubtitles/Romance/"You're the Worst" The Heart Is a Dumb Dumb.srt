1
00:00:02,648 --> 00:00:04,970
So you kissed, and then what happened?

2
00:00:05,048 --> 00:00:07,483
Then she showed me her bronze medal.

3
00:00:07,616 --> 00:00:09,167
She did? Why?

4
00:00:09,246 --> 00:00:12,267
Because she was understandably proud of it.

5
00:00:12,314 --> 00:00:15,222
She... she was proud of her bronze medal?

6
00:00:15,257 --> 00:00:17,315
It's quite beautiful, close up.

7
00:00:18,151 --> 00:00:19,587
- What?
- Why would a person

8
00:00:19,622 --> 00:00:21,925
just show someone their butthole?

9
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,204
What? No!

10
00:00:23,239 --> 00:00:24,861
A real bronze medal.

11
00:00:24,896 --> 00:00:25,744
- Oh!
- Why would you think

12
00:00:25,779 --> 00:00:27,711
I meant a butthole?

13
00:00:27,746 --> 00:00:29,866
Well, you said "bronze medal."

14
00:00:29,901 --> 00:00:31,986
I mean, it is the third best hole.

15
00:00:32,304 --> 00:00:33,988
Brownish.

16
00:00:34,109 --> 00:00:35,733
So, you're feeling, um...

17
00:00:35,768 --> 00:00:37,008
Human.

18
00:00:37,043 --> 00:00:38,651
- A little human.
- Huh.

19
00:00:38,686 --> 00:00:40,016
So, next time you feel,

20
00:00:40,051 --> 00:00:42,680
you know, "it" coming on, maybe you

21
00:00:42,715 --> 00:00:45,399
- should try switching your meds?
- Meds?

22
00:00:45,434 --> 00:00:46,784
You're not on anti-depressants?

23
00:00:46,818 --> 00:00:48,348
Shit, no. I don't want to lose my edge.

24
00:00:48,383 --> 00:00:49,806
What?

25
00:00:49,841 --> 00:00:50,769
So you're-you're telling me

26
00:00:50,804 --> 00:00:52,667
you could have just taken a pill

27
00:00:52,702 --> 00:00:54,922
this whole time and you didn't?

28
00:00:54,957 --> 00:00:56,072
Nope.

29
00:00:56,259 --> 00:00:57,495
Wow!

30
00:00:57,530 --> 00:00:58,698
Well...

31
00:00:59,756 --> 00:01:00,349
Wow!

32
00:01:00,384 --> 00:01:02,448
We just proved I don't need medication.

33
00:01:02,483 --> 00:01:05,543
You actually can fix me!

34
00:01:05,578 --> 00:01:07,705
My bad.

35
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,093
You're upright!

36
00:01:10,128 --> 00:01:11,685
Why do you have two burgers?

37
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,173
One's for my baby.

38
00:01:13,208 --> 00:01:14,116
New Tinder rando?

39
00:01:14,151 --> 00:01:15,913
No, the baby in my pussy.

40
00:01:15,946 --> 00:01:18,549
- Bye.
- Jesus Christ, Lindser!

41
00:01:18,584 --> 00:01:20,208
Are you serious?

42
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:22,058
That microwave thing actually worked?

43
00:01:22,093 --> 00:01:24,717
Guess so. I just heated
it up like a baked potato.

44
00:01:24,752 --> 00:01:27,728
So, you and me, abobo and
then Marie Callender's?

45
00:01:27,763 --> 00:01:29,883
Sure. You know what's funny?

46
00:01:29,918 --> 00:01:31,123
Two weeks ago,

47
00:01:31,158 --> 00:01:32,630
I would have trapped Paul

48
00:01:32,665 --> 00:01:34,610
and torpedoed his gross relationship

49
00:01:34,645 --> 00:01:36,837
with Crunchy Princess Limp Hair.

50
00:01:36,872 --> 00:01:38,230
But I think I've matured.

51
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:39,776
Amy was right.

52
00:01:39,811 --> 00:01:42,572
I had a perfect man and I let him go.

53
00:01:42,607 --> 00:01:44,578
Linds, you never liked Paul.

54
00:01:44,613 --> 00:01:46,373
You only referred to him as dork,

55
00:01:46,408 --> 00:01:49,148
Lumpy Hubby, Paul Nye the Science Homo...

56
00:01:49,183 --> 00:01:51,141
Do you think he's going to be
at Becca's baby shower later?

57
00:01:51,176 --> 00:01:52,042
You going to tell him?

58
00:01:52,077 --> 00:01:53,117
No.

59
00:01:53,151 --> 00:01:54,808
I'm moving on.

60
00:01:55,264 --> 00:01:58,317
So, who's this basic ho

61
00:01:58,352 --> 00:01:59,475
Jimmy hooked up with?

62
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:00,511
Oh, it doesn't matter.

63
00:02:00,546 --> 00:02:01,511
Huh. If I were you,

64
00:02:01,546 --> 00:02:02,601
I would totally want to see

65
00:02:02,636 --> 00:02:06,225
what brand of slizz I was up against.

Oh!

71
00:02:53,511 --> 00:02:54,354
Uh-uh-uh.

72
00:02:54,389 --> 00:02:57,143
You are not serving your
stale, mail-order popcorn.

73
00:02:57,178 --> 00:03:00,502
Babe, people love fancy
popcorn, it's a proven fact.

74
00:03:00,564 --> 00:03:02,472
All right. As long as there's
no trash juice this time.

75
00:03:02,507 --> 00:03:04,011
'Course not. I promised.

76
00:03:04,046 --> 00:03:05,589
All right.

77
00:03:09,683 --> 00:03:11,939
Becca, you dummy.

78
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:16,226
There's Jimmy's car.

79
00:03:16,374 --> 00:03:17,132
You'll feel better

80
00:03:17,167 --> 00:03:18,696
after you tell him.

81
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:20,697
You know, maybe-maybe
I'll still drive over

82
00:03:20,732 --> 00:03:22,207
every morning to cook him breakfast

83
00:03:22,242 --> 00:03:24,464
until he eventually
discovers I've moved out,

84
00:03:24,499 --> 00:03:25,998
and by then, he'll see

85
00:03:26,033 --> 00:03:28,322
it won't have to change
anything between us.

86
00:03:28,357 --> 00:03:30,096
Things need to change between you, Edgar.

87
00:03:30,131 --> 00:03:31,096
You're always saying that.

88
00:03:31,131 --> 00:03:33,423
Well, I always say I didn't
know it was a school, too.

89
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:34,977
Look, I want you to feel proud

90
00:03:35,012 --> 00:03:36,394
that you're going to be living with me.

91
00:03:36,429 --> 00:03:37,721
You're right.

92
00:03:37,756 --> 00:03:38,298
I'll tell him.

93
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:40,687
Thank you.

94
00:03:40,722 --> 00:03:41,837
Wait, about that school...

95
00:03:41,872 --> 00:03:42,514
Oh, kidding.

96
00:03:42,549 --> 00:03:44,953
I totally didn't know.

97
00:03:46,534 --> 00:03:48,518
You're goddamn pregnant?

98
00:03:48,596 --> 00:03:50,764
I'm not keeping it.

99
00:03:50,905 --> 00:03:52,073
Well, I should hope not.

100
00:03:52,108 --> 00:03:53,528
And I'm gonna be a good sister.

101
00:03:53,563 --> 00:03:54,917
I'm not drinking.

102
00:03:54,952 --> 00:03:55,983
I'm gonna make sure everyone knows

103
00:03:56,018 --> 00:03:57,372
this is your day.

104
00:03:57,407 --> 00:04:01,012
I even brought lemons
this time, like you asked.

105
00:04:02,406 --> 00:04:03,220
Uh...

106
00:04:03,255 --> 00:04:04,749
Please don't tell Paul.

107
00:04:04,782 --> 00:04:06,318
Of course not.

108
00:04:07,255 --> 00:04:09,875
What a disaster.

109
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:14,927
I can have one.

110
00:04:19,489 --> 00:04:21,872
The popcorn is trash juice.

111
00:04:21,907 --> 00:04:24,702
Pass it on.

112
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:27,432
I need to tell you something.

113
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:29,732
Gretchen has never taken meds!

114
00:04:29,767 --> 00:04:31,367
Really? After all that?

115
00:04:31,402 --> 00:04:32,591
Exactly.

116
00:04:32,626 --> 00:04:34,865
And then she said she
doesn't ever need to now,

117
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,398
because she has me to fix her.

118
00:04:37,433 --> 00:04:39,483
Between her, you, Killian,

119
00:04:39,518 --> 00:04:42,033
I have to be the emotional
bedrock for everyone.

120
00:04:42,068 --> 00:04:43,819
When's it my turn to be taken care of?

121
00:04:43,854 --> 00:04:44,750
You know what?

122
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:45,948
Today.

123
00:04:45,983 --> 00:04:47,266
Today's my turn.

124
00:04:47,301 --> 00:04:50,731
I'm going to get absolutely snozzelled.

125
00:04:50,793 --> 00:04:52,114
Well, this is leading towards something

126
00:04:52,149 --> 00:04:53,582
dangerously misguided.

127
00:04:53,617 --> 00:04:56,591
We'll see how she likes
taking care of me for a change.

128
00:04:56,626 --> 00:05:00,391
You probably don't want to
get to "Level Two Jimmy drunk"

129
00:05:00,426 --> 00:05:02,185
around all these people.

130
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,823
Or maybe I do.

131
00:05:34,837 --> 00:05:36,639
It's on the house...

132
00:05:37,383 --> 00:05:38,986
Gretchen.

133
00:05:42,049 --> 00:05:44,167
For what it's worth, Jimmy
and I aren't talking right now.

134
00:05:44,202 --> 00:05:45,509
You know nothing really happened.

135
00:05:45,544 --> 00:05:47,821
Eh, we had problems already.

136
00:05:47,856 --> 00:05:49,446
I'm sorry anyway.

137
00:05:49,481 --> 00:05:50,927
Relationships are tough.

138
00:05:50,962 --> 00:05:53,194
He's just such a child!

139
00:05:53,229 --> 00:05:56,188
The other day, he bought
an $80 toy helicopter

140
00:05:56,223 --> 00:05:57,451
which he broke immediately.

141
00:05:57,486 --> 00:05:59,192
Do you know what he talked to
me about for an hour straight?

142
00:05:59,227 --> 00:06:00,727
- Tree houses?
- Yes!

143
00:06:00,762 --> 00:06:01,933
A full hour!

144
00:06:01,968 --> 00:06:04,770
Yeah, you got off easy.

145
00:06:06,418 --> 00:06:07,959
Let's grab a table.

146
00:06:09,492 --> 00:06:12,151
You're articulate, brilliant, courageous,

147
00:06:12,186 --> 00:06:16,333
dexterous, enthralling, foxy...

148
00:06:16,427 --> 00:06:17,886
G... galvanizing.

149
00:06:17,921 --> 00:06:19,327
Oh, I love it!

150
00:06:19,362 --> 00:06:21,494
You're articulate, brilliant, courageous,

151
00:06:21,529 --> 00:06:25,033
dexterous, enthralling,
foxy, galvanizing...

152
00:06:25,072 --> 00:06:27,564
and... horny.

153
00:06:27,626 --> 00:06:29,047
Amy!

154
00:06:29,082 --> 00:06:30,692
I have to go to the little girls' room.

155
00:06:30,727 --> 00:06:31,662
Save my seat?

156
00:06:31,697 --> 00:06:33,345
Always.

157
00:06:36,247 --> 00:06:37,509
Whew!

158
00:06:38,521 --> 00:06:39,804
Mm.

159
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:43,468
Just know I'm not really mad
at you for ditching Lindsay.

160
00:06:43,609 --> 00:06:44,841
I mean, you...

161
00:06:44,876 --> 00:06:47,212
you dodged a bullet with that.

162
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,282
And by bullet,

163
00:06:48,317 --> 00:06:52,258
I mean... it's way smaller
than a bullet right now,

164
00:06:52,293 --> 00:06:53,488
but probably just as dumb.

165
00:06:53,523 --> 00:06:55,866
Unless it got your genes.

166
00:06:55,901 --> 00:06:56,672
What?

167
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:58,286
Oh, dang it.

168
00:06:58,321 --> 00:06:59,721
I guess you figured it out.

169
00:06:59,756 --> 00:07:01,247
My sister impregnated herself

170
00:07:01,282 --> 00:07:02,372
by heating a condom

171
00:07:02,407 --> 00:07:04,731
full of your sperm in a microwave.

172
00:07:05,053 --> 00:07:07,155
You know, that's scientifically impossible

173
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:09,333
in ten different ways.

174
00:07:09,646 --> 00:07:10,534
Of course.

175
00:07:10,569 --> 00:07:12,307
That's my point.

176
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:13,457
Knowing her, she probably seduced

177
00:07:13,492 --> 00:07:14,871
the drive-thru guy at Del Taco

178
00:07:14,906 --> 00:07:16,242
and is just saying it's yours.

179
00:07:16,277 --> 00:07:18,279
Well, yes.

180
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:22,377
There's literally no way we...

181
00:07:22,474 --> 00:07:23,609
Wait.

182
00:07:28,266 --> 00:07:29,434
Oh...

183
00:07:33,634 --> 00:07:35,703
Oh, my God.

184
00:07:38,628 --> 00:07:39,630
Mm!

185
00:07:40,046 --> 00:07:41,598
I can have one.

186
00:07:59,337 --> 00:08:00,672
Mmm.

187
00:08:01,252 --> 00:08:02,921
Fruity.

188
00:08:05,591 --> 00:08:07,330
I seriously thought I was going crazy,

189
00:08:07,365 --> 00:08:08,994
I was texting and texting,

190
00:08:09,029 --> 00:08:12,036
and then I saw him lying in the bushes.

191
00:08:12,071 --> 00:08:13,953
One time, Jimmy spilled a bowl of cereal

192
00:08:13,988 --> 00:08:16,391
when Edgar wasn't home,
so he hid under his bed

193
00:08:16,426 --> 00:08:18,738
for two hours, until I
finally cleaned it up.

194
00:08:18,773 --> 00:08:20,231
And you date him.

195
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:22,036
Willingly.

196
00:08:22,091 --> 00:08:24,386
The heart is a dumb dumb.

197
00:08:24,451 --> 00:08:26,621
The dumbest dumb of them all.

198
00:08:27,732 --> 00:08:29,965
You're so pretty.

199
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,382
I can see why Jimmy almost
went to the cabin with you.

200
00:08:33,523 --> 00:08:36,598
There's something so captivating about you.

201
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:38,020
What is it?

202
00:08:38,055 --> 00:08:39,491
Uh... I don't know.

203
00:08:42,013 --> 00:08:45,512
How can you be athletic and funny?

204
00:08:45,547 --> 00:08:46,069
Gotta find out.

205
00:08:46,104 --> 00:08:48,730
- What are you doing?
- What? What are you doing?

206
00:08:48,765 --> 00:08:50,368
What is wrong with you?

207
00:08:50,403 --> 00:08:52,041
I'm not scared, if that's
what you're worried about.

208
00:08:52,076 --> 00:08:53,029
Get out of my bar!

209
00:08:53,064 --> 00:08:54,617
Come on, just kiss me.

210
00:08:54,652 --> 00:08:56,578
You kissed my boyfriend.

211
00:08:56,922 --> 00:08:58,315
Kiss me!

212
00:08:58,433 --> 00:08:59,491
Kiss me!

213
00:08:59,587 --> 00:09:01,002
You kiss me, girl!

214
00:09:01,037 --> 00:09:02,054
- Kiss me!
- Stop!

215
00:09:02,089 --> 00:09:03,398
What is wrong with you guys?

216
00:09:03,433 --> 00:09:05,686
- I am a real person!
- Are you?

217
00:09:05,721 --> 00:09:07,910
You're a skier who owns a bar.

218
00:09:07,945 --> 00:09:08,708
You don't think that sounds

219
00:09:08,743 --> 00:09:10,644
just a little bit like some male fantasy?

220
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:11,912
Come on, just kiss my mouth.

221
00:09:11,947 --> 00:09:13,389
- Kiss it!
- This might be a mistake,

222
00:09:13,424 --> 00:09:13,932
'cause you could have

223
00:09:13,967 --> 00:09:15,289
- crazy-person strength,
- Ow.

224
00:09:15,324 --> 00:09:15,830
- but if you don't
- Ow.

225
00:09:15,865 --> 00:09:17,127
get the hell out of my bar,

226
00:09:17,162 --> 00:09:19,355
I'm going to have to kick your ass.

227
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:20,668
God, that was so hot.

228
00:09:20,703 --> 00:09:23,219
Can you believe the
sexual tension between us?

229
00:09:38,288 --> 00:09:40,159
It's occupied.

230
00:09:40,194 --> 00:09:41,922
Occupied!

231
00:09:42,305 --> 00:09:43,364
Vernon, what the heck?

232
00:09:43,398 --> 00:09:44,360
I'm using the toilet!

233
00:09:44,395 --> 00:09:46,385
I need cash. My cards are maxed.

234
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:47,408
I wrote a bum check

235
00:09:47,443 --> 00:09:49,170
for my latest malpractice insurance.

236
00:09:49,252 --> 00:09:50,932
Man, I better not mess up any surgeries!

237
00:09:50,967 --> 00:09:53,846
I just gave you $15,000.

238
00:09:53,881 --> 00:09:55,477
You're the one who gave
money to a money pig.

239
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:56,189
That's on you.

240
00:09:56,224 --> 00:09:57,876
This isn't a good time.

241
00:09:57,927 --> 00:10:00,423
I just received some highly enervating news

242
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:01,880
that has my bowels in a state.

243
00:10:01,915 --> 00:10:03,309
You don't know enervating, Paul!

244
00:10:03,344 --> 00:10:04,707
Come talk to me about enervating

245
00:10:04,742 --> 00:10:06,522
when you got a goddamn baby on the way

246
00:10:06,557 --> 00:10:08,354
that's gonna cost at least a half millie

247
00:10:08,389 --> 00:10:09,421
in its stupid life.

248
00:10:09,456 --> 00:10:11,052
Just give me that money, turkey-dick!

249
00:10:11,087 --> 00:10:12,505
You shut the hell up,

250
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,372
- Vernon!
- Goddamn it.

251
00:10:14,407 --> 00:10:16,103
- Get the hell out of this bathroom
- Where is it?!

252
00:10:16,138 --> 00:10:19,141
or I will destroy you and
everything that you love!

253
00:10:19,176 --> 00:10:20,612
- I will smother you
- Ow.

254
00:10:20,647 --> 00:10:23,179
in your sleep, so help me God!

255
00:10:23,214 --> 00:10:25,191
I hate you! Give me that money, nerd!

256
00:10:25,226 --> 00:10:27,883
Get out, get out, get out!

257
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:28,904
Ah! Stop it!

258
00:10:28,939 --> 00:10:30,722
- Get out!
- God!

259
00:10:30,757 --> 00:10:33,663
- You are such an asshole.
- Get out!

260
00:10:33,698 --> 00:10:36,216
I wish you were dead!

261
00:10:41,986 --> 00:10:43,258
Where's Gretchen?

262
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:45,445
Jimmy, I'm moving out.

263
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,447
I'm so sorry, but the time has come

264
00:10:47,482 --> 00:10:48,987
for me to strike out on my own, and I...

265
00:10:49,022 --> 00:10:52,181
Ooh, you have to get a
place with a pool. Or a gym.

266
00:10:52,216 --> 00:10:53,858
Ac-Actually, we already have a place.

267
00:10:53,893 --> 00:10:54,584
We?

268
00:10:54,619 --> 00:10:56,025
- Me and Dorothy.
- What?

269
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:58,363
You've only known her
for about an hour, man.

270
00:10:58,398 --> 00:11:01,452
Who else do you know who moved
in with someone way too soon?

271
00:11:01,487 --> 00:11:02,822
Hmm?

272
00:11:04,623 --> 00:11:05,718
Me!

273
00:11:05,823 --> 00:11:08,244
I got saddled with a lemon.

274
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:08,984
Guess what I spent

275
00:11:09,019 --> 00:11:11,119
all afternoon doing Wednesday?

276
00:11:11,152 --> 00:11:13,620
I sat in a pillow fort

277
00:11:13,655 --> 00:11:15,292
while she wept.

278
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:16,318
So boring.

279
00:11:16,353 --> 00:11:17,661
Wait, Wednesday?

280
00:11:17,696 --> 00:11:19,028
That's why you missed my show?

281
00:11:19,063 --> 00:11:21,261
And no one can see you have a lemon.

282
00:11:21,295 --> 00:11:22,495
You pull up to the valet

283
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:24,910
and people are like, "Ooh, nice car,"

284
00:11:24,945 --> 00:11:27,758
but they can't see all the
work it needs on the interior.

285
00:11:27,858 --> 00:11:28,865
And then...

286
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,691
you find out there was a factory recall

287
00:11:30,726 --> 00:11:33,845
and that they could've fixed it themselves?

288
00:11:34,745 --> 00:11:35,962
Oh, no.

289
00:11:35,997 --> 00:11:37,811
Level Two Jimmy drunk:

290
00:11:37,845 --> 00:11:39,513
Angry Jimmy.

291
00:11:39,547 --> 00:11:41,690
Okay, just slow down

292
00:11:41,725 --> 00:11:44,236
before you get yourself to Level Three.

293
00:11:44,271 --> 00:11:46,496
Whose idea was this?

294
00:11:46,531 --> 00:11:47,536
Mine.

295
00:11:47,571 --> 00:11:49,147
And when did you have it?

296
00:11:49,182 --> 00:11:53,196
When she took me to go see an
apartment that she couldn't...

297
00:11:53,231 --> 00:11:56,385
quite afford on her own.

298
00:12:04,186 --> 00:12:06,540
♪ Play your favorite song ♪

299
00:12:06,671 --> 00:12:08,961
♪ Get your arm ready ♪

300
00:12:09,082 --> 00:12:11,470
♪ Take two deep breaths... ♪

301
00:12:22,934 --> 00:12:25,133
You're scaring me.

302
00:12:31,629 --> 00:12:33,653
Have you seen the rest of the house?

303
00:12:33,739 --> 00:12:35,035
Yikes.

304
00:12:35,069 --> 00:12:36,730
It is literally the exact opposite

305
00:12:36,782 --> 00:12:38,370
of how we should decorate our place.

306
00:12:38,417 --> 00:12:41,459
There's a framed poster
of G. Love & Special Sauce.

307
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:42,160
I shit you not.

308
00:12:42,195 --> 00:12:43,967
I can't move in with you.

309
00:12:44,002 --> 00:12:45,604
What? Why?

310
00:12:47,189 --> 00:12:51,691
Turns out, Jimmy missed the
show for a really good reason,

311
00:12:51,726 --> 00:12:54,289
and-and-and I...
I just got angry,

312
00:12:54,324 --> 00:12:55,680
and I made this rash decision, and...

313
00:12:55,715 --> 00:12:58,251
Okay, honey, listen to me.

314
00:12:58,286 --> 00:13:01,395
This is your chance to
start your life over.

315
00:13:01,428 --> 00:13:03,530
With me.

316
00:13:03,774 --> 00:13:04,469
You're ready.

317
00:13:04,504 --> 00:13:08,132
No, but I'm not ready
for what you want from me.

318
00:13:08,217 --> 00:13:11,560
You tell me that I am, but I'm not.

319
00:13:12,238 --> 00:13:14,091
Maybe in a few years.

320
00:13:15,358 --> 00:13:16,994
I don't have a few years.

321
00:13:17,121 --> 00:13:19,686
I spent four years too goddamn
long in that comedy house

322
00:13:19,721 --> 00:13:21,950
'cause I thought we were going somewhere.

323
00:13:22,102 --> 00:13:24,686
I don't have any more time to waste.

324
00:13:24,789 --> 00:13:26,713
I'm sorry.

325
00:13:30,856 --> 00:13:33,628
I can't believe this.

326
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:36,755
Goddamn you, Edgar.

327
00:13:48,749 --> 00:13:50,855
Okay, uh, everyone, hello.

328
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:54,316
Hi, everybody, gather round, please.

329
00:13:54,855 --> 00:13:57,677
Well, the moment of truth has arrived.

330
00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:00,153
In just a minute, we are gonna
be cutting into that cake,

331
00:14:00,188 --> 00:14:01,434
and depending on its color,

332
00:14:01,469 --> 00:14:02,622
finding out if we're gonna raising

333
00:14:02,657 --> 00:14:06,405
a-a precious little
baby girl or a macho boy.

334
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,825
Isn't that fun?

335
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:10,888
- We want to...
- Hello.

336
00:14:10,923 --> 00:14:11,855
Sorry.

337
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:14,427
I'd just like to say a few words.

338
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:16,004
Okay, now is not really the time.

339
00:14:16,039 --> 00:14:17,687
It's cool, Bec... It's all love.

340
00:14:17,722 --> 00:14:19,081
Oh, my God, Level Three.

341
00:14:19,116 --> 00:14:20,379
No, it's not, Becca.

342
00:14:20,414 --> 00:14:21,577
Happy Jimmy.

343
00:14:21,612 --> 00:14:25,125
Becca, y-you... are so special.

344
00:14:25,175 --> 00:14:26,445
No, I'm serious.

345
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,773
You take in my words.

346
00:14:27,808 --> 00:14:30,255
You accept how special you are.

347
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:31,908
You are a treasure.

348
00:14:31,943 --> 00:14:33,191
- Okay.
- Come here.

349
00:14:33,226 --> 00:14:35,174
- Come here, I'm gonna hug on you.
- Okay.

350
00:14:37,682 --> 00:14:38,934
Look at this woman...

351
00:14:38,969 --> 00:14:42,371
she's like a lioness on the savannah,

352
00:14:42,455 --> 00:14:45,292
just preparing to expel her...

353
00:14:45,325 --> 00:14:47,795
It must have been my pre-ejaculate.

354
00:14:47,916 --> 00:14:49,075
Goddamn, Becca.

355
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:52,037
Since we broke up, I started life-logging.

356
00:14:52,072 --> 00:14:53,632
I record everything.

357
00:14:53,667 --> 00:14:57,960
My conversations, bowel movements, fitness.

358
00:14:59,089 --> 00:15:01,504
My life in searchable data.

359
00:15:01,539 --> 00:15:02,705
And according to my records,

360
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:07,039
we did have unprotected vaginal
intercourse for 37 seconds

361
00:15:07,074 --> 00:15:09,095
before I donned a sheath.

362
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:13,089
Though the odds of conception
from pre-ejaculate are narrow,

363
00:15:13,124 --> 00:15:16,002
as you know, I do have a heavy seminal load

364
00:15:16,037 --> 00:15:19,259
of high viscosity and opacity.

365
00:15:19,662 --> 00:15:22,095
Oh, what happened to your face?

366
00:15:22,128 --> 00:15:24,729
Amy was signing so fast with her left hand,

367
00:15:24,764 --> 00:15:26,173
I didn't see the right hook coming.

368
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:28,472
- She hit you?
- And more.

369
00:15:28,507 --> 00:15:31,383
- Why?
- 'Cause I broke up with her.

370
00:15:31,813 --> 00:15:34,259
Do you remember when I told
you the definition of love

371
00:15:34,294 --> 00:15:37,302
was putting someone else's
needs above your own,

372
00:15:37,337 --> 00:15:39,127
and you said, "Ew"?

373
00:15:39,162 --> 00:15:40,455
Ew.

374
00:15:40,758 --> 00:15:41,636
I mean, yes.

375
00:15:41,671 --> 00:15:43,249
Tonight, you put me first

376
00:15:43,284 --> 00:15:46,355
when you decided not to
trap me with your pregnancy.

377
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:47,505
I quit on you.

378
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:49,657
I was a hypocrite.

379
00:15:49,724 --> 00:15:51,886
So, Lindsay...

380
00:15:51,949 --> 00:15:53,793
let's have baby.

381
00:15:55,071 --> 00:15:57,110
I don't know, Paul.

382
00:15:57,145 --> 00:15:59,470
I was really unhappy.

383
00:16:02,369 --> 00:16:04,633
Think about it, okay?

384
00:16:07,368 --> 00:16:10,096
It's just so sad, you know?

385
00:16:10,278 --> 00:16:11,979
Level Four.

386
00:16:13,169 --> 00:16:14,780
I've only heard about this.

387
00:16:14,815 --> 00:16:17,017
Edgar.

388
00:16:17,079 --> 00:16:20,020
My confidant.

389
00:16:20,212 --> 00:16:24,023
A Grumio to my Petruchio.

390
00:16:24,091 --> 00:16:28,041
The sweetest man I've ever known.

391
00:16:28,076 --> 00:16:33,479
It's so beautiful that you
and Dorothy found each other.

392
00:16:33,514 --> 00:16:35,380
But I just... I just broke up with her.

393
00:16:35,415 --> 00:16:37,597
Why'd you do that?

394
00:16:37,632 --> 00:16:39,089
You told me to.

395
00:16:39,124 --> 00:16:41,314
But Dorothy's amazing.

396
00:16:41,349 --> 00:16:43,139
You said she manipulated me.

397
00:16:43,174 --> 00:16:45,278
So what?

398
00:16:45,872 --> 00:16:47,908
Go!

399
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:50,839
Hey, I know it's cliché,

400
00:16:50,874 --> 00:16:54,618
but, really, what-what if
there were no possessions?

401
00:16:54,653 --> 00:16:56,634
Can you imagine that?

402
00:16:56,669 --> 00:17:00,139
Uh, do you guys know
my girlfriend, Gretchen?

403
00:17:00,174 --> 00:17:01,850
She's supposed to be here.

404
00:17:01,885 --> 00:17:04,590
She got sad for a long time.

405
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:06,417
That was hard.

406
00:17:06,452 --> 00:17:08,875
I'm used to being the complicated one.

407
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:10,471
Like, with-with Becca.

408
00:17:10,503 --> 00:17:13,907
Becca's, uh, like a Monday crossword.

409
00:17:14,003 --> 00:17:15,275
Gretchen...

410
00:17:15,429 --> 00:17:18,570
Sunday.

411
00:17:18,711 --> 00:17:20,348
Takes-takes all day,

412
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:23,617
but it's rewarding as hell.

413
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:26,847
Gretchen!

414
00:17:26,919 --> 00:17:30,291
You had a little too much
to drink, didn't you, buddy?

415
00:17:31,455 --> 00:17:34,084
Gretchen, what the hell am I doing up here?

416
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:36,288
Aw, I know.

417
00:17:37,282 --> 00:17:41,379
Y-You... have to help me,

418
00:17:41,414 --> 00:17:43,216
'cause my turn.

419
00:17:43,251 --> 00:17:45,421
It is, Jimmy.

420
00:17:45,701 --> 00:17:50,755
Okay, oh, I'm so sorry, everybody.

421
00:17:50,912 --> 00:17:52,011
Vernon.

422
00:17:52,082 --> 00:17:54,341
My father was a petty man.

423
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:56,136
Demeaning.

424
00:17:56,171 --> 00:17:58,229
Stingy.

425
00:17:58,473 --> 00:18:00,501
I think that's why I'm
so scared to be a father.

426
00:18:00,536 --> 00:18:02,898
Vernon, put down that mic right now.

427
00:18:02,933 --> 00:18:05,717
No, I have been silent too long!

428
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:07,427
I became a doctor...

429
00:18:07,462 --> 00:18:09,692
because I was born dead,

430
00:18:09,793 --> 00:18:11,018
but do you guys have any idea...

431
00:18:11,053 --> 00:18:12,655
You never came.

432
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:14,943
I tried to kiss Nina, and
she kicked me out of her bar.

433
00:18:14,978 --> 00:18:16,613
What?

434
00:18:16,663 --> 00:18:18,671
But you're so hot.

435
00:18:18,706 --> 00:18:20,641
I'm so hot.

436
00:18:20,676 --> 00:18:22,065
Did you wear your booby shirt?

437
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,871
Of course I wore my booby shirt.

438
00:18:23,906 --> 00:18:26,208
Anyway, I can see what you like about her.

439
00:18:26,243 --> 00:18:27,407
She's hella foxy.

440
00:18:27,493 --> 00:18:29,115
She a'ight.

441
00:18:29,966 --> 00:18:31,624
Ooh.

442
00:18:31,659 --> 00:18:33,511
I have a problem, you guys.

443
00:18:33,588 --> 00:18:36,877
I gave control of my finances
to a woman I don't know.

444
00:18:36,912 --> 00:18:38,605
There's nothing sexual about it.

445
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,062
Fine, I jack off to it sometimes,

446
00:18:40,097 --> 00:18:40,637
but that's not what it's about.

447
00:18:42,443 --> 00:18:45,631
I regret being born dead,

448
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:48,668
and I regret not being
ready to be a father,

449
00:18:48,702 --> 00:18:51,659
and I regret going to
see The Babadook.

450
00:18:51,694 --> 00:18:53,841
It was so scary, you guys.

451
00:18:53,933 --> 00:18:57,155
But mostly I regret hurting my wife.

452
00:18:57,190 --> 00:19:00,510
I regret, but I am not ashamed anymore.

453
00:19:00,545 --> 00:19:02,416
I am not ashamed.

454
00:19:02,448 --> 00:19:03,939
But I reiterate...

455
00:19:03,994 --> 00:19:06,263
do not see The Babadook.

456
00:19:06,298 --> 00:19:07,422

478
00:21:00,221 --> 00:21:02,186
but does that mean we have to break up?

479
00:21:02,221 --> 00:21:05,173
Because when two people
connect like I think we do,

480
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:08,451
I refuse to believe that
things have to just end.

481
00:21:08,486 --> 00:21:09,411
That's madness.

482
00:21:09,446 --> 00:21:12,507
I-I refuse to believe that
life has to be like that.

483
00:21:12,542 --> 00:21:14,246
I simply refuse.

484
00:21:14,281 --> 00:21:17,732
Life has to make more sense than that.

485
00:21:17,767 --> 00:21:19,538
Dude, we just got in a little fight.

486
00:21:19,573 --> 00:21:22,666
And now I'm taking the bus
home to show you how mad I am.

487
00:21:22,733 --> 00:21:25,178
- You're supposed to come after me.
- Oh.

488
00:21:25,213 --> 00:21:27,329
You thought we broke up?

489
00:21:27,817 --> 00:21:29,738
People don't behave like that, dummy.

490
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:35,214
Want to go get some food,

491
00:21:35,362 --> 00:21:37,284
help me figure out how
to get my deposit back?

492
00:21:37,319 --> 00:21:40,126

A doctor someone.

Maybe see about some medication.

your face and put you to bed,

you said something to
me that was pretty dark.

Don't tell me.

529
