My mother used it
for sewing.

She'd let me sit with her
in her chamber while she sewed

howling.

76

Old Nan used to
tell me stories

77
00:07:09,903 --> 00:07:11,937
about magical people
who could live

78
00:07:11,972 --> 00:07:16,675
inside stags,
birds, wolves.

79
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:18,677
That's exactly
what they are, Bran--

80

- stories.
- So she was lying?

81
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,549

- Well, they may have done.

And Rickon had
the same dream.

What about all the dreams
you had that didn't come true?

Only one Maester in 100
wears it on his chain.

96
00:08:05,726 --> 00:08:09,695
It signifies that I have
studied the higher mysteries.

97
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:13,899
And all who study these mysteries
try their hand at spells.

98
00:08:13,933 --> 00:08:15,835
I was no different.

99
00:08:15,869 --> 00:08:17,937
I was young.

100
00:08:17,971 --> 00:08:22,541
And what boy doesn't secretly
wish for hidden powers

101
00:08:22,576 --> 00:08:26,679
to lift him out of his
dull life into a special one?

102
00:08:26,713 --> 00:08:29,548
But in the end,
for all my efforts,

103
00:08:29,582 --> 00:08:32,818
I got no more out of it
than 1,000 boys before me.

00:13:03,755 --> 00:13:05,389
( Chuckles )

165
00:13:13,864 --> 00:13:16,099
Don't worry, My Lady.

166
00:13:16,133 --> 00:13:18,201
Our war is just beginning.

167
00:13:23,407 --> 00:13:26,442
( Men shouting )

168
00:13:31,349 --> 00:13:33,616
- Your Grace.
- Gerard.

169
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:36,285
- How's your foot?
- Better, Your Grace.

170
00:13:36,319 --> 00:13:38,620
They don't know
their own size is all.

171
00:13:38,655 --> 00:13:40,789
Good man.

172
00:13:42,592 --> 00:13:44,659
I have 100,000 men
at my command.

173
00:13:44,694 --> 00:13:47,295
All the might of the Stormlands
and the Reach.

174
00:13:47,329 --> 00:13:50,665
And all of them young and bold
like your Knight of Flowers?

175
00:13:51,834 --> 00:13:54,403
It's a game to you,
isn't it?

176
00:13:54,437 --> 00:13:56,705
- I pity them.
- Why?

177
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,607
Because it won't last.

178
00:13:58,642 --> 00:14:02,912
Because they are the Knights of summer
and winter is coming.

179
00:14:04,215 --> 00:14:08,586
Brienne, escort
Lady Catelyn to her tent.

180
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:11,623
- She's tired from her journey.
- <i>At once, Your Grace.</i>

181
00:14:11,657 --> 00:14:13,892
- Shall I return after?
- <i>That won't be necessary.</i>

182
00:14:13,926 --> 00:14:17,262
I would pray awhile.
Alone.

183
00:14:18,531 --> 00:14:20,565
If you'll follow me,
My Lady.

184
00:14:23,502 --> 00:14:26,204
You fought bravely today,
Lady Brienne.

185
00:14:26,238 --> 00:14:28,606
I fought for my King.

186
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:31,309
Soon I'll fight for him
on the battlefield.

187
00:14:31,343 --> 00:14:34,011
Die for him
if I must.

188
00:14:34,045 --> 00:14:38,215
And, if it please you,
Brienne's enough.

189
00:14:38,249 --> 00:14:40,451
I'm no lady.

190
00:15:11,784 --> 00:15:13,752
What are you doing here?

191
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:15,988
I live here.

192
00:15:16,022 --> 00:15:20,126
- Are you angry with me, brother?
- You lying bitch.

193
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,162
It's not my fault
you didn't recognize me.

194
00:15:23,197 --> 00:15:26,432
Recognize you?
How could I?

195
00:15:26,466 --> 00:15:28,334
The last time I saw you...

196
00:15:29,736 --> 00:15:31,871
You looked like
a fat little boy.

197
00:15:32,907 --> 00:15:35,541
You were a fat
little boy, too,

198
00:15:35,575 --> 00:15:38,111
but I recognized you.

199
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:39,579
Why didn't you tell me?

200
00:15:39,614 --> 00:15:41,649
I wanted to see
who you were first.

201
00:15:41,683 --> 00:15:43,684
( Laughs )
And I did.

202
00:15:45,888 --> 00:15:48,957
The plans are made.
It's time you heard them.

203
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:51,859
- Father.
- Father.

204
00:15:53,295 --> 00:15:55,696
The wolf pup
has gone south

205
00:15:55,731 --> 00:15:59,266
with the entirety of the northern
army at his back.

206
00:15:59,301 --> 00:16:01,602
While he's tangling with
the lion in the Westerlands,

207
00:16:01,637 --> 00:16:04,371
the north is ripe
for the taking.

208
00:16:04,405 --> 00:16:08,008
The Ironborn will reave and
pillage as it was in the old days

209
00:16:08,042 --> 00:16:10,043
all along the northern coast.

210
00:16:10,077 --> 00:16:13,114
We'll spread our dominion
across the green lands,

211
00:16:13,148 --> 00:16:16,017
<i>securing the Neck</i>
<i>and everything above.</i>

212
00:16:16,051 --> 00:16:18,954
Every stronghold will yield
to us one by one.

213
00:16:18,989 --> 00:16:21,657
Winterfell may defy us
for a year, but what of it?

214
00:16:21,692 --> 00:16:23,693
The rest shall be ours--

215
00:16:23,727 --> 00:16:27,197
forest, field and hall.

216
00:16:31,036 --> 00:16:34,137
Yara, my daughter,
you'll take 30 longships

217
00:16:34,172 --> 00:16:36,040
<i>to attack Deepwood Motte.</i>

218
00:16:36,074 --> 00:16:38,142
I've always wanted
a castle.

219
00:16:38,176 --> 00:16:40,844
And what's my role
in all this?

220
00:16:42,447 --> 00:16:45,983
You'll take a ship to raid the
fishing villages on the Stoney Shore.

221
00:16:46,017 --> 00:16:47,751
A ship?

222
00:16:47,786 --> 00:16:49,820
You give her 30
and I get one?

223
00:16:49,855 --> 00:16:53,357
The sea bitch. We thought
she'd be perfect for you.

224
00:16:55,528 --> 00:16:56,961
I'm to fight fishermen?

225
00:16:56,996 --> 00:16:59,398
Be careful
of their nets.

226
00:17:02,335 --> 00:17:06,740
Father, I fought with Robb Stark.
I know his men.

227
00:17:06,774 --> 00:17:08,542
He won't give up
the North so easily.

228
00:17:08,576 --> 00:17:10,377
They won't even know we're
there until it's too late.

229
00:17:10,411 --> 00:17:11,711
What do you
know of it, woman?

230
00:17:11,746 --> 00:17:13,480
I'm a proven warrior.

231
00:17:13,514 --> 00:17:16,616
Your brothers were warriors,
both of them dead

232
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:20,286
at the hands of those
you seem so eager to protect.

233
00:17:21,955 --> 00:17:23,789
I'm not protecting anyone.

234
00:17:23,823 --> 00:17:26,091
I just wonder
if it's not wiser to wait.

235
00:17:26,126 --> 00:17:29,828
Why risk going against the North
if they would be our allies?

236
00:17:29,862 --> 00:17:32,497
Rise up against them
and they could destroy us.

237
00:17:32,532 --> 00:17:34,967
But if we pledge
fealty to them,

238
00:17:35,002 --> 00:17:37,036
they'll give us
Casterly Rock.

239
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:40,074
What are our words?

240
00:17:40,108 --> 00:17:41,942
Our words?

241
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:47,149
- "We do not sow."
- "We do not sow."

242
00:17:47,183 --> 00:17:48,951
We are Ironborn.

243
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:51,820
We're not subjects.
We're not slaves.

244
00:17:51,855 --> 00:17:54,957
We do not plow the fields
or toil in the mine.

245
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:57,994
We take what is ours.

246
00:17:58,028 --> 00:18:01,531
Your time with the wolves
has made you weak.

247
00:18:05,136 --> 00:18:08,204
You act as if
I volunteered to go.

248
00:18:08,239 --> 00:18:11,207
You gave me away,
if you remember.

249
00:18:11,241 --> 00:18:13,543
The day you bent the knee
to Robert Baratheon.

250
00:18:13,577 --> 00:18:15,845
After he crushed you.

251
00:18:15,879 --> 00:18:17,747
Did you take
what was yours then?

252
00:18:21,685 --> 00:18:23,386
You gave me away!

253
00:18:24,488 --> 00:18:26,556
Your boy!

254
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:28,959
Your last boy!

255
00:18:28,993 --> 00:18:32,762
You gave me away like I was some dog
you didn't want anymore.

256
00:18:32,797 --> 00:18:36,166
And now you curse me
because I've come home.

257
00:18:46,077 --> 00:18:49,479
You'd have our father bow
down to your other family?

258
00:18:49,514 --> 00:18:52,081
I have no other family.

259
00:18:52,116 --> 00:18:54,150
Don't you?

260
00:18:55,385 --> 00:18:57,687
Make your choice, Theon,
and do it quickly.

261
00:18:57,722 --> 00:19:00,490
Our ships sail
with or without you.

262
00:19:12,636 --> 00:19:14,303
You won't let me
leave this room.

263
00:19:14,338 --> 00:19:17,340
- You won't let me--
- Shh, shh, keep your voice down.

264
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:23,446
Why? You think your father
can hear me?

265
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:26,115
He's 300 miles away!

266
00:19:26,149 --> 00:19:28,117
( Sighs )

267
00:19:28,152 --> 00:19:31,153
I don't intend for you
to stay here.

268
00:19:31,188 --> 00:19:34,090
I might be able to bring you into
the castle kitchens.

269
00:19:34,124 --> 00:19:37,793
Again, only temporary.

270
00:19:37,827 --> 00:19:40,362
Every man who has
tasted my cooking

271
00:19:40,397 --> 00:19:42,398
has told me what
a good whore I am.

272
00:19:42,432 --> 00:19:44,400
But you wouldn't
be a cook.

273
00:19:44,434 --> 00:19:48,137
You'd pose
as a scullion.

274
00:19:48,172 --> 00:19:51,374
Scullion?
What is a scullion?

275
00:19:51,409 --> 00:19:54,077
Kitchen wench.

276
00:19:54,111 --> 00:19:56,780
- A kitchen wench?
- Yes, but--

277
00:19:56,814 --> 00:19:58,308
Cleaning pots?

278
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:00,901
Is that how my lion
wants to see me?

279
00:20:00,985 --> 00:20:03,720
Your lion wants
to see you alive.

280
00:20:03,754 --> 00:20:06,189
We've come to
a dangerous place.

281
00:20:06,223 --> 00:20:08,024
My sister wants to hurt me.

282
00:20:08,059 --> 00:20:10,226
She'll look for any
weakness she can find.

283
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:12,128
She can't know about you.

284
00:20:12,162 --> 00:20:14,263
I'm the weakness?

285
00:20:14,298 --> 00:20:15,764
It's a compliment,
My Lady.

286
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:19,467
How is being a weakness
a compliment?

287
00:20:22,538 --> 00:20:24,239
Language can be
a bit tricky here.

288
00:20:24,273 --> 00:20:28,109
Oh, I'm too stupid
to understand.

289
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:30,511
The stupid foreign girl.

290
00:20:32,948 --> 00:20:36,250
I am not
a kitchen wench.

291
00:21:00,974 --> 00:21:03,476
When will Joffrey
and Sansa be married?

292
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:06,044
Soon, darling,
when the war is over.

293
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:08,980
Mother says I'll have
a new gown for the ceremony

294
00:21:09,015 --> 00:21:11,450
and another for the feast.

295
00:21:11,484 --> 00:21:14,553
But yours will be ivory
since you're the bride.

296
00:21:18,692 --> 00:21:20,894
The Princess
just spoke to you.

297
00:21:20,928 --> 00:21:22,997
Pardon, Your Grace.

298
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:27,668
I'm sure your dress will
be beautiful, Myrcella.

299
00:21:27,702 --> 00:21:31,238
I'm counting the days
until the fighting is done

300
00:21:31,273 --> 00:21:35,342
and I can pledge my love to
the King in sight of the Gods.

301
00:21:39,546 --> 00:21:41,814
Is Joffrey going to kill
Sansa's brother?

302
00:21:44,351 --> 00:21:46,418
He might.

303
00:21:48,054 --> 00:21:50,488
Would you like that?

304
00:21:52,024 --> 00:21:54,659
No.
I don't think so.

305
00:21:55,895 --> 00:21:59,564
Even if he does,
Sansa will do her duty.

306
00:22:01,334 --> 00:22:03,335
Won't you, little dove?

307
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:22,954
- <i>( Knocking )</i>
- ( Gasps ) Come in.

308
00:22:22,989 --> 00:22:26,725
<i>( Door opens )</i>

309
00:22:26,759 --> 00:22:28,126
Who are you?

310
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:31,062
I'm Shae, My Lady.
Your new handmaiden.

311
00:22:31,097 --> 00:22:34,499
I didn't know I needed
a new handmaiden.

312
00:22:36,102 --> 00:22:38,904
- You're not from here.
- No.

313
00:22:45,013 --> 00:22:46,547
What are you doing?

314
00:22:46,581 --> 00:22:48,449
Waiting for you
to tell me what to do.

315
00:22:48,484 --> 00:22:50,718
I shouldn't have to tell
you to do things.

316
00:22:50,753 --> 00:22:52,988
You should just do them.

317
00:22:53,022 --> 00:22:55,190
What things?

318
00:22:55,224 --> 00:22:57,292
Change my linens,
wash my clothing,

319
00:22:57,326 --> 00:23:00,929
scrub the floor, empty my chamber pot,
brush my hair.

320
00:23:09,772 --> 00:23:11,606
- No.
- You said to brush--

321
00:23:11,641 --> 00:23:14,442
Not now.

322
00:23:16,012 --> 00:23:18,880
Your chamber pot
is empty.

323
00:23:18,914 --> 00:23:21,183
Clean the table.

324
00:23:25,788 --> 00:23:28,590
Have you ever been
a handmaiden before?

325
00:23:28,624 --> 00:23:30,659
- Yes.
- For whom?

326
00:23:30,694 --> 00:23:32,694
- Lady Zuriff.
- Lady Zuriff?

327
00:23:34,698 --> 00:23:36,598
Lady Zuriff.

328
00:23:36,633 --> 00:23:40,336
There is no Lady Zuriff
in this city.

329
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:42,271
She wasn't in
this city.

330
00:23:42,305 --> 00:23:44,707
Well, I don't know how
they did things in that city,

331
00:23:44,741 --> 00:23:47,676
but in this city,
handmaidens wait on ladies,

332
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:49,245
not the other way around.

333
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:52,181
And I don't have time
to answer 1,000 questions

334
00:23:52,215 --> 00:23:54,683
and teach you
how to do your job.

335
00:23:57,854 --> 00:23:59,521
Do you want me to leave?

336
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:09,465
Just brush my hair.

337
00:24:23,749 --> 00:24:26,351
Oh, thank the Gods.

338
00:24:26,385 --> 00:24:28,620
I haven't had
a proper shit in six days.

339
00:24:28,654 --> 00:24:32,157
I've encountered this
problem before, My Lord.

340
00:24:32,191 --> 00:24:35,694
The stresses of power
often have this

341
00:24:35,728 --> 00:24:37,529
insalubrious effect.

342
00:24:37,564 --> 00:24:40,698
Two drops
with water daily.

343
00:24:40,733 --> 00:24:42,600
Right. I'm so grateful
to have a man

344
00:24:42,635 --> 00:24:45,336
of your vast knowledge
and wisdom on my side.

345
00:24:45,371 --> 00:24:48,239
- Please.
- Thank you, My Lord.

346
00:24:53,045 --> 00:24:55,147
I can trust you,
Pycelle, can I not?

347
00:24:55,181 --> 00:24:56,982
Why, yes, of course,
My Lord.

348
00:24:57,017 --> 00:24:59,185
These are perilous times.

349
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:01,187
And the crown must forge
new alliances.

350
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:06,327
And these alliances must often
be sealed in matrimony.

351
00:25:06,361 --> 00:25:08,863
Matrimony, huh?

352
00:25:08,897 --> 00:25:10,799
Yes.

353
00:25:10,833 --> 00:25:13,034
I'm trusting the council
with these plans,

354
00:25:13,069 --> 00:25:14,803
but the queen mustn't know.

355
00:25:14,837 --> 00:25:17,405
We can't have her
meddling in affairs

356
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,785
that could determine
the future of the realm.

357
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:20,010
There's too much at stake.

358
00:25:20,176 --> 00:25:23,144
Oh, yes, yes.
Indeed, yes.

359
00:25:23,179 --> 00:25:26,447
I shall be silent
as the grave.

360
00:25:26,482 --> 00:25:30,551
I'm brokering an alliance
with House Martell of Dorne.

361
00:25:30,586 --> 00:25:33,054
Princess Myrcella will wed
their youngest son

362
00:25:33,088 --> 00:25:36,024
when she comes of age,
ensuring their loyalty

363
00:25:36,059 --> 00:25:38,728
and their army
should we need it.

364
00:25:38,762 --> 00:25:42,733
Myrcella sent away
to Dorne?

365
00:25:44,436 --> 00:25:47,806
But remember,
the queen mustn't know.

366
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:51,109
Ooh, "the queen
mustn't know."

367
00:25:51,144 --> 00:25:54,679
I love conversations
that begin this way.

368
00:25:54,714 --> 00:25:57,949
I plan to marry
Princess Myrcella off

369
00:25:57,984 --> 00:25:59,684
to Theon Greyjoy.

370
00:26:01,254 --> 00:26:03,455
Theon Greyjoy?

371
00:26:03,489 --> 00:26:06,224
Forgive me, My Lord,?

372
00:26:06,258 --> 00:26:09,127
He grew up a ward
of Winterfell.

373
00:26:09,162 --> 00:26:10,795
He fights
for Robb Stark.

374
00:26:10,829 --> 00:26:14,365
Precisely. Theon's father
loathes the Starks

375
00:26:14,399 --> 00:26:17,168
and will convince the boy
to come to our side.

376
00:26:17,236 --> 00:26:20,671
Greyjoy can destroy
the northern army from within

377
00:26:20,706 --> 00:26:23,240
<i>and we can have</i>
<i>his father's ships.</i>

378
00:26:23,275 --> 00:26:26,777
But remember,
you must tell no one.

379
00:26:26,812 --> 00:26:29,347
Tell no one what?

380
00:26:29,381 --> 00:26:33,351
I plan to wed Princess Myrcella to
Robin Arryn of the Vale.

381
00:26:35,054 --> 00:26:38,222
Lysa is not fond of me.

382
00:26:38,257 --> 00:26:40,592
But perhaps the promise
of a royal match

383
00:26:40,626 --> 00:26:43,861
will convince her
to let bygones be bygones.

384
00:26:43,895 --> 00:26:45,830
She imprisoned you.

385
00:26:45,864 --> 00:26:47,932
She tried
to execute you.

386
00:26:47,966 --> 00:26:50,901
And you offer
her son a princess?

387
00:26:50,936 --> 00:26:54,771
For men in our position,
holding grudges can be

388
00:26:54,806 --> 00:26:56,573
an encumbrance,
don't you think?

389
00:26:56,608 --> 00:27:00,978
And I suppose you want me
to broker this agreement?

390
00:27:01,012 --> 00:27:02,646
Who better?

391
00:27:06,784 --> 00:27:09,252
Yes, I could sing
this song to Lysa,

392
00:27:09,286 --> 00:27:11,521
if I cared to.

393
00:27:11,555 --> 00:27:13,757
What's in it
for me?

394
00:27:15,627 --> 00:27:17,896
The gratitude of
the people of Westeros

395
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:19,631
for helping to end
this war,

396
00:27:19,666 --> 00:27:23,836
the adoration of the King for
bringing the Vale back into the fold...

397
00:27:25,639 --> 00:27:27,507
and Harrenhal.

398
00:27:27,541 --> 00:27:29,942
Harrenhal is cursed.

399
00:27:29,977 --> 00:27:31,878
Never took you
for a superstitious man.

400
00:27:31,912 --> 00:27:33,812
By all means,
tear it down and rebuild.

401
00:27:33,847 --> 00:27:35,614
You'll be able
to afford it.

402
00:27:35,648 --> 00:27:38,450
I plan to make you
Lord of the Riverlands.

403
00:27:40,352 --> 00:27:42,091
With a single stroke,
you'd make me one of the

404
00:27:42,116 --> 00:27:43,154
greatest lords in the realm.

405
00:27:43,155 --> 00:27:46,423
You served my family well
in the matter of the succession.

406
00:27:46,458 --> 00:27:49,660
So did Janos Slynt, and he
was given Harrenhal, too.

407
00:27:49,694 --> 00:27:52,596
Until you snatched it away.

408
00:27:52,631 --> 00:27:54,932
I need you to
deliver Lysa Arryn.

409
00:27:54,966 --> 00:27:57,702
I didn't need
Janos Slynt.

410
00:28:00,106 --> 00:28:02,574
<i>It's settled, then?</i>

411
00:28:03,677 --> 00:28:05,310
Good.

412
00:28:07,547 --> 00:28:09,748
Oh, and remember--

413
00:28:09,783 --> 00:28:11,617
the queen mustn't know.

414
00:28:23,397 --> 00:28:26,265
( Breathing heavily )

415
00:28:50,492 --> 00:28:52,159
That must hurt.

416
00:28:52,194 --> 00:28:54,461
( Groans )

417
00:29:02,304 --> 00:29:04,405
What?

418
00:29:06,041 --> 00:29:07,474
What is it?

419
00:29:07,509 --> 00:29:09,510
( Scoffs )

420
00:29:09,544 --> 00:29:12,413
A member of the Kingsguard?

421
00:29:12,447 --> 00:29:15,283
As if I wasn't humiliated
enough already.

422
00:29:15,317 --> 00:29:17,552
( Sighs )

423
00:29:17,586 --> 00:29:21,823
Brienne is a very
capable warrior.

424
00:29:23,025 --> 00:29:25,393
And she's devoted to me.

425
00:29:27,063 --> 00:29:29,631
You're jealous.

426
00:29:29,665 --> 00:29:31,567
Jealous?

427
00:29:31,601 --> 00:29:33,769
Of Brienne the beauty?

428
00:29:33,803 --> 00:29:35,870
Don't make me laugh.

429
00:29:37,507 --> 00:29:41,242
- I'll make it up to you.
- No, Your Grace.

430
00:29:42,378 --> 00:29:44,579
Not tonight.

431
00:29:44,614 --> 00:29:47,248
There's another Tyrell
who requires your attention.

432
00:29:47,283 --> 00:29:48,983
You didn't win
my father's support

433
00:29:49,018 --> 00:29:51,152
or his army
on charm alone.

434
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:08,569
Your vassals are starting
to snigger behind your back.

435
00:30:08,603 --> 00:30:11,572
Brides aren't usually virgins
two weeks after their wedding night.

436
00:30:11,607 --> 00:30:13,475
And Margaery's a virgin?

437
00:30:13,509 --> 00:30:15,711
Officially.

438
00:30:17,046 --> 00:30:19,081
Shall I bring her
to you?

439
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,781
I should warn you,

440
00:30:47,815 --> 00:30:49,749
I've had quite
a bit of wine.

441
00:30:49,784 --> 00:30:52,319
As is your right.
You are a King.

442
00:30:54,223 --> 00:30:56,391
You look
very beautiful.

443
00:30:56,425 --> 00:30:58,292
Thank you,
Your Grace.

444
00:30:58,327 --> 00:31:02,264
- It's a lovely gown.
- <i>You think so?</i>

445
00:31:02,298 --> 00:31:05,034
I can't decide
how I like it better.

446
00:31:05,069 --> 00:31:07,170
This way...

447
00:31:07,204 --> 00:31:10,207
or this way.

448
00:31:16,348 --> 00:31:17,981
You certainly don't need it.

449
00:31:19,617 --> 00:31:21,085
Although...

450
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:24,722
some say that
beauty most desired

451
00:31:24,756 --> 00:31:26,524
is the beauty concealed.

452
00:31:42,976 --> 00:31:45,211
Must be the wine.

453
00:31:45,245 --> 00:31:47,813
Here, let me.

454
00:32:03,229 --> 00:32:05,797
( Shudders )

455
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,768
I'm sorry.

456
00:32:09,802 --> 00:32:11,970
Do you want my brother
to come in and help?

457
00:32:14,974 --> 00:32:17,376
- What?
- He could get you started.

458
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:18,742
I know he wouldn't mind.

459
00:32:18,767 --> 00:32:21,346
Or I can turn over and you
can pretend I'm him.

460
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:26,152
I don't know what
you're talking about.

461
00:32:31,326 --> 00:32:34,128
There's no need
for us to play games.

462
00:32:34,163 --> 00:32:37,365
Save your lies for court.
You're going to need a lot of them.

463
00:32:55,985 --> 00:32:58,886
Your enemies
aren't happy about us.

464
00:32:58,921 --> 00:33:01,255
They want to tear
us apart.

465
00:33:01,290 --> 00:33:04,358
And the best way
to stop them

466
00:33:04,392 --> 00:33:07,695
is to put your baby

467
00:33:07,729 --> 00:33:10,197
in my belly.

468
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:15,603
We can try again later.

469
00:33:15,637 --> 00:33:17,505
You decide how
you want to do it--

470
00:33:17,539 --> 00:33:19,407
with me,
with me and Loras.

471
00:33:19,441 --> 00:33:21,910
However else you like.

472
00:33:24,281 --> 00:33:26,982
Whatever you need to do.

473
00:33:28,985 --> 00:33:32,288
You are a King.

474
00:33:40,598 --> 00:33:42,865
Cersei:
<i>You monster.</i>

475
00:33:42,899 --> 00:33:45,234
Myrcella is my only daughter.

476
00:33:45,269 --> 00:33:47,937
Do you really think I'll let you
sell her like a common whore?

477
00:33:47,971 --> 00:33:49,505
Myrcella's a Princess.

478
00:33:49,539 --> 00:33:51,173
Some would say
she was born for this.

479
00:33:51,208 --> 00:33:52,875
I will not let you
ship her off to Dorne

480
00:33:52,943 --> 00:33:55,044
as I was shipped off
to Robert Baratheon.

481
00:33:55,078 --> 00:33:57,379
Dorne is the safest place
or her.

482
00:33:57,413 --> 00:34:00,816
Are you mad?
The Martells loathe us.

483
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:03,285
That's why we need
to seduce them.

484
00:34:03,319 --> 00:34:05,153
We're going to need
their support in the war

485
00:34:05,188 --> 00:34:07,055
your son started.

486
00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:09,324
- She'll be a hostage.
- A guest.

487
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:11,961
You won't get away
with this.

488
00:34:11,995 --> 00:34:15,931
You think the piece of paper father
gave you keeps you safe.

489
00:34:18,568 --> 00:34:21,437
Ned Stark had a piece
of paper, too.

490
00:34:23,039 --> 00:34:25,807
- It's done, Cersei.
- No.

491
00:34:25,842 --> 00:34:30,045
- You cannot stop it.
- No!

492
00:34:32,248 --> 00:34:35,516
<i>Just how safe do you think</i>
<i>Myrcella is if this city falls?</i>

493
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:39,386
Do you want to see her raped,
butchered like the Targaryen children?

494
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:41,655
Make no mistake.

495
00:34:41,689 --> 00:34:44,291
They'll mount her pretty little head
on a spike right beside yours.

496
00:34:44,325 --> 00:34:46,626
Get out!
Get out!

497
00:35:48,154 --> 00:35:51,056
Theon of
the House Greyjoy,

498
00:35:51,091 --> 00:35:54,727
you would this day consecrate
your faith to the drowned God?

499
00:36:02,704 --> 00:36:05,540
- I would.
- <i>Kneel.</i>

500
00:36:08,911 --> 00:36:10,278
Let Theon,
your servant,

501
00:36:10,313 --> 00:36:13,482
be born again from
the sea as you were.

502
00:36:13,516 --> 00:36:16,251
Bless him with salt.

503
00:36:18,588 --> 00:36:21,423
Bless him with stone.

504
00:36:21,458 --> 00:36:23,225
Bless him with steel.

505
00:36:28,432 --> 00:36:30,533
What is dead
may never die.

506
00:36:30,567 --> 00:36:32,669
What is dead
may never die...

507
00:36:34,138 --> 00:36:37,807
But rises again
harder and stronger.

508
00:36:37,842 --> 00:36:39,943
Stand.

509
00:37:00,366 --> 00:37:02,968
<i>( Dog barking )</i>

510
00:37:06,506 --> 00:37:08,708
<i>( Footsteps approaching )</i>

511
00:37:08,742 --> 00:37:13,312
I don't appreciate being
made a fool of, dwarf.

512
00:37:13,347 --> 00:37:14,847
If Myrcella marries
the Martell boy,

513
00:37:14,881 --> 00:37:17,115
she can't very well
marry Robin Arryn, can she?

514
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:20,285
No, afraid not.
Sorry about that.

515
00:37:20,319 --> 00:37:22,120
And Harrenhal--

516
00:37:22,154 --> 00:37:25,223
I suppose that's
off the table as well.

517
00:37:25,257 --> 00:37:28,960
Yes, I fear so.
Sorry about that, too.

518
00:37:28,994 --> 00:37:31,161
Leave me out of your
next deception.

519
00:37:31,196 --> 00:37:33,197
Oh, that's a shame.

520
00:37:33,231 --> 00:37:36,533
You were to be the centerpiece of
my next deception.

521
00:37:36,568 --> 00:37:39,837
My brother Jaime rots
in a Northern stockade.

522
00:37:39,872 --> 00:37:42,073
I would see him released.

523
00:37:42,107 --> 00:37:43,574
That's where you come in.

524
00:37:43,609 --> 00:37:46,077
Robb Stark will never
release the Kingslayer.

525
00:37:46,111 --> 00:37:49,748
No, he won't.
But his mother might.

526
00:37:49,782 --> 00:37:52,685
How would you like to see
your beloved Cat again?

527
00:37:52,719 --> 00:37:55,221
<i>( Footsteps approaching )</i>

528
00:37:56,290 --> 00:37:58,391
- Find him?
- Oh, aye.

529
00:37:58,426 --> 00:38:00,360
And he has company.

530
00:38:01,997 --> 00:38:04,765
Filthy old stoat.
Almost hate to interrupt.

531
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,169
- No, you don't.
- No, I don't.

532
00:38:12,408 --> 00:38:15,043
- ( Door bursts )
- ( Gasps )

533
00:38:15,077 --> 00:38:17,779
What is the meaning
of this?

534
00:38:17,814 --> 00:38:19,815
No, please, please.

535
00:38:19,849 --> 00:38:22,250
You disappoint me,
Grand Maester.

536
00:38:22,284 --> 00:38:25,020
I am your loyal servant.

537
00:38:25,054 --> 00:38:26,856
So loyal that you told
the Queen about my plans

538
00:38:26,881 --> 00:38:28,486
to send Myrcella to Dorne.

539
00:38:28,524 --> 00:38:30,291
No! Never!

540
00:38:30,326 --> 00:38:32,961
It's a falsehood.
I swear it.

541
00:38:32,995 --> 00:38:34,463
It wasn't me.

542
00:38:34,497 --> 00:38:36,198
Ah, Varys.

543
00:38:36,232 --> 00:38:39,334
It was Varys
the spider.

544
00:38:39,369 --> 00:38:43,505
See, I told Varys that I was giving
the Princess to the Greyjoys.

545
00:38:43,539 --> 00:38:48,076
I told Littlefinger that I planned
to wed her to Robin Arryn.

546
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:51,547
I told no one that I was
offering her to the Dornish.

547
00:38:52,482 --> 00:38:54,149
No one but you.

548
00:38:54,184 --> 00:38:56,718
The eunuch has
spies everywhere.

549
00:38:56,753 --> 00:38:59,154
Cut off his manhood
and feed it to the goats.

550
00:38:59,188 --> 00:39:01,623
- No, no, no.
- There are no goats, halfman.

551
00:39:01,657 --> 00:39:03,692
Well, make do.

552
00:39:03,726 --> 00:39:05,761
( Whimpering )

553
00:39:05,795 --> 00:39:08,097
How long have you
been spying for my sister?

554
00:39:08,131 --> 00:39:10,733
All I did, I did
for House Lannister.

555
00:39:10,767 --> 00:39:13,235
<i>Always. Your lord father,</i>
<i>ask him.</i>

556
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:15,070
I've always been
his servant

557
00:39:15,105 --> 00:39:17,006
since the days
of the Mad King.

558
00:39:18,576 --> 00:39:21,645
- I don't like his beard.
- What?

559
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,481
What?
Oh, no. No.

560
00:39:23,515 --> 00:39:26,584
( Whimpering )

561
00:39:26,619 --> 00:39:29,788
How many hands have you
betrayed, Pycelle?

562
00:39:29,822 --> 00:39:32,257
Eddard Stark?
Jon Arryn?

563
00:39:32,292 --> 00:39:34,025
Lord Arryn,
he knew.

564
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:36,995
( Stammering ) He knew the truth
about the queen.

565
00:39:37,029 --> 00:39:40,631
And, well,
he planned to act,

566
00:39:40,666 --> 00:39:42,500
to tell King Robert.

567
00:39:42,534 --> 00:39:43,834
So you poisoned him?

568
00:39:43,869 --> 00:39:46,236
No. Never.

569
00:39:46,271 --> 00:39:49,105
But you let him die,
made sure he succumbed.

570
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:51,674
Lannister--
I always served Lannister.

571
00:39:51,709 --> 00:39:54,376
Get him out of my sight.
Throw him in one of the black cells.

572
00:39:54,411 --> 00:39:56,278
Oh, no. No, no, no.
No, please.

573
00:39:56,313 --> 00:39:58,480
<i>Don't!</i>
<i>You can't do this to me!</i>

574
00:40:00,083 --> 00:40:01,283
For your trouble.

575
00:40:01,317 --> 00:40:04,185
<i>( Pycelle shouting )</i>

576
00:40:25,573 --> 00:40:28,175
You'll be pleased to know
our mutual friend

577
00:40:28,209 --> 00:40:31,611
<i>is doing quite well</i>
<i>in Lady Sansa's service.</i>

578
00:40:31,645 --> 00:40:35,014
Good.
One of my better ideas.

579
00:40:35,048 --> 00:40:37,383
And it seems
the Grand Maester

580
00:40:37,417 --> 00:40:39,852
has found his way
into a black cell.

581
00:40:41,821 --> 00:40:44,322
Well played,
My Lord Hand.

582
00:40:45,558 --> 00:40:47,758
But should I be worried?

583
00:40:47,793 --> 00:40:49,760
Janos Slynt,
Pycelle--

584
00:40:49,795 --> 00:40:53,097
the small council
grows smaller every day.

585
00:40:53,132 --> 00:40:56,000
The council has a reputation
for serving past Hands poorly.

586
00:40:56,034 --> 00:40:59,170
I don't mean to follow
Ned Stark to the grave.

587
00:41:00,205 --> 00:41:03,574
Power is a curious thing,
My Lord.

588
00:41:03,609 --> 00:41:05,743
Are you fond of riddles?

589
00:41:05,778 --> 00:41:07,745
Why, am I about
to hear one?

590
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:10,214
Three great men
sit in a room.

591
00:41:10,249 --> 00:41:12,851
A king, a priest
and a rich man.

592
00:41:12,885 --> 00:41:15,654
Between them stands
a common Sellsword.

593
00:41:15,688 --> 00:41:19,625
<i>Each great man bids the</i>
<i>Sellsword kill the other two.</i>

594
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:22,428
Who lives, who dies?

595
00:41:22,463 --> 00:41:24,698
Depends on the Sellsword.

596
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:26,867
Does it?
He has neither crown

597
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:29,136
nor gold nor favor
with the Gods.

598
00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:31,405
He has a sword,
the power of life and death.

599
00:41:31,439 --> 00:41:33,574
But if it's swordsmen
who rule,

600
00:41:33,608 --> 00:41:36,110
why do we pretend
Kings hold all the power?

601
00:41:36,144 --> 00:41:38,879
<i>When Ned Stark</i>
<i>lost his head,</i>

602
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:41,715
<i>who was truly responsible?</i>

603
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:44,084
Joffrey?
The executioner?

604
00:41:44,118 --> 00:41:45,685
Or something else?

605
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:48,054
I've decided
I don't like riddles.

606
00:41:50,625 --> 00:41:55,295
Power resides where
men believe it resides.

607
00:41:55,330 --> 00:41:57,197
It's a trick,

608
00:41:57,231 --> 00:41:59,967
a shadow on the wall.

609
00:42:00,001 --> 00:42:03,838
And a very small man

610
00:42:03,872 --> 00:42:06,407
can cast a very large shadow.

611
00:42:11,346 --> 00:42:14,381
<i>( Crickets chirping )</i>

612

<i>( Door opens )</i>

615
00:42:46,415 --> 00:42:48,917
You should be sleeping.

616
00:42:48,951 --> 00:42:52,219
Tomorrow's a long march.

617
00:42:52,254 --> 00:42:55,222
30 miles if it
don't piss on us.

618
00:42:56,524 --> 00:42:58,158
I can't sleep.

619
00:43:02,797 --> 00:43:04,697
I don't like the taste.

620
00:43:04,731 --> 00:43:07,099
( Chuckles )

621
00:43:07,134 --> 00:43:10,369
Well...

622
00:43:10,403 --> 00:43:14,106
You don't drink it
for the flavor, to be honest.

623
00:43:21,747 --> 00:43:23,214
What?

624
00:43:23,248 --> 00:43:26,817
How do you sleep?

625
00:43:26,852 --> 00:43:29,053
Same as most men,
I think.

626
00:43:29,087 --> 00:43:31,755
But you've seen things,

627
00:43:31,789 --> 00:43:35,059
horrible things.

628
00:43:35,093 --> 00:43:37,729
Aye.

629
00:43:37,763 --> 00:43:40,765
I've seen some
pretty things, too,

630
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,035
but not nearly so many.

631
00:43:43,069 --> 00:43:46,473
How do you sleep
when you--

632
00:43:48,676 --> 00:43:53,013
when you have those
things in your head?

633
00:43:54,816 --> 00:43:57,785
You didn't see that.

634
00:43:57,819 --> 00:43:59,387
I made damn sure.

635
00:43:59,421 --> 00:44:01,656
I close my eyes
and I see them up there.

636
00:44:03,125 --> 00:44:05,427
All of them

637
00:44:05,461 --> 00:44:08,063
standing there--

638
00:44:08,098 --> 00:44:10,665
Joffrey,

639
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:13,268
the Queen,

640
00:44:13,303 --> 00:44:15,670
and--

641
00:44:15,705 --> 00:44:18,106
and my sister.

642
00:44:26,515 --> 00:44:31,018
You know, we've got something
in common, me and you.

643
00:44:31,052 --> 00:44:33,387
You know that?

644
00:44:33,421 --> 00:44:35,957
I must have been

645
00:44:35,991 --> 00:44:38,460
a couple of years
older than you.

646
00:44:40,396 --> 00:44:42,765
I saw my brother stabbed
through the heart

647
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,834
<i>right on our doorstep.</i>

648
00:44:44,868 --> 00:44:48,404
<i>He weren't much of a villain</i>
<i>what skewered him.</i>

649
00:44:48,439 --> 00:44:51,040
<i>Willem, the lad's name was.</i>

650
00:44:53,010 --> 00:44:55,912
He ran off before
anyone could spit.

651
00:44:55,947 --> 00:44:59,149
And I just stood there,

652
00:44:59,183 --> 00:45:01,852
watching my brother die.

653
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:06,156
<i>But here's the funny part.</i>

654
00:45:06,190 --> 00:45:09,393
I can't picture
my brother's face anymore.

655
00:45:09,427 --> 00:45:12,062
<i>But Willem--</i>

656
00:45:12,097 --> 00:45:15,066
oh, he was
a nice-looking boy.

657
00:45:16,502 --> 00:45:18,869
He had good white teeth,

658
00:45:18,904 --> 00:45:21,206
blue eyes,

659
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:24,976
<i>one of those dimpled chins</i>
<i>all the girls like.</i>

660
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:30,215
<i>I would think about him</i>
<i>when I was working,</i>

661
00:45:30,249 --> 00:45:34,319
when I was drinking,
when I was having a shit.

662
00:45:34,353 --> 00:45:36,621
It got to the point

663
00:45:36,656 --> 00:45:39,891
where I would say his name
every night before I went to bed.

664
00:45:39,925 --> 00:45:42,426
Willem. Willem.

665
00:45:42,461 --> 00:45:45,196
<i>Willem.</i>

666
00:45:45,230 --> 00:45:47,398
A prayer almost.

667
00:45:49,167 --> 00:45:51,835
<i>Well, one day...</i>

668
00:45:53,004 --> 00:45:56,907
<i>Willem came riding</i>
<i>back into town.</i>

669
00:45:59,276 --> 00:46:03,113
I buried an ax so deep
into Willem's skull,

670
00:46:03,147 --> 00:46:06,950
<i>they had to bury</i>
<i>him with it.</i>

671
00:46:06,984 --> 00:46:10,287
Willem's horse
got me to the Wall

672
00:46:10,321 --> 00:46:13,089
and I've been wearing
black ever since.

673
00:46:17,095 --> 00:46:19,097
Well...

674
00:46:19,131 --> 00:46:22,100
that'll help you sleep, eh?

675
00:46:23,370 --> 00:46:25,771
<i>( Horn sounds )</i>

676
00:46:25,806 --> 00:46:28,240
<i>( Men shouting )</i>

677
00:46:28,275 --> 00:46:29,542
Ho!

678
00:46:29,576 --> 00:46:32,745
Get up, you lazy
sons of whores!

679
00:46:32,779 --> 00:46:35,648
Arm yourselves.

680
00:46:35,682 --> 00:46:37,316
- Gendry: Get up.
- Arya: Get up.

681
00:46:37,351 --> 00:46:39,218
Keep out of sight,
both of you.

682
00:46:39,252 --> 00:46:40,786
- No, I'm not afraid.
- I can fight.

683
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:43,055
Keep out of sight.

684
00:46:43,089 --> 00:46:45,657
If things go wrong,
you run.

685
00:46:45,691 --> 00:46:46,920
Do you hear me?

686
00:46:46,945 --> 00:46:49,627
You run along North
and don't look back.

687
00:46:49,862 --> 00:46:52,397
Hey, there's men
out there

688
00:46:52,431 --> 00:46:54,667
who want to fuck
your corpses.

689
00:46:54,701 --> 00:46:57,369
Outside, now!

690
00:46:58,572 --> 00:47:00,640
Man:
<i>Come on, move, move!</i>

691
00:47:00,674 --> 00:47:02,442
<i>( Horse whinnies )</i>

692

( Shouting )

696
00:47:15,758 --> 00:47:19,594
Hey, you!
Open the damn cage!

697
00:47:23,133 --> 00:47:24,934
Where's the bastard, Crow?

698
00:47:24,968 --> 00:47:27,738
Got more than a few bastards here.
Who's asking?

699
00:47:27,772 --> 00:47:30,507
Ser Amory Lorch, sworn Bannerman
to Lord Tywin Lannister.

700
00:47:30,542 --> 00:47:34,711
<i>These men from the capital</i>
<i>requested our assistance.</i>

701
00:47:34,745 --> 00:47:36,612
Drop your weapons
in the name of the King.

702
00:47:36,647 --> 00:47:38,681
Now, which King
would that be?

703
00:47:38,715 --> 00:47:40,616
This is your last chance.

704
00:47:40,650 --> 00:47:43,351
In the name
of King Joffrey,

705
00:47:43,385 --> 00:47:45,620
drop your weapons.

706
00:47:47,389 --> 00:47:51,091
( Spits )
I don't think I will.

707
00:47:51,125 --> 00:47:53,293
So be it.

708
00:47:53,328 --> 00:47:55,963
( Grunts )

709
00:47:55,997 --> 00:47:59,533
I always hated crossbows.
Take too long to load.

710
00:48:16,652 --> 00:48:18,620
( Groans )

711
00:48:24,761 --> 00:48:27,363
( Gurgles )

712
00:48:37,341 --> 00:48:39,475
Jaqen: Boy, come here.
Boy!

713
00:48:39,509 --> 00:48:43,045
- Sweet boy, help us.
- Come back here!

714
00:48:43,079 --> 00:48:44,346
Help us, boy!

715
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:46,915
( Shouting )

716
00:48:48,184 --> 00:48:50,919
A man can fight!
Free us!

717
00:48:57,393 --> 00:48:59,895
Quick, give it to me.

718
00:49:01,531 --> 00:49:04,099
Give me the ax.
Give me that.

719
00:49:12,475 --> 00:49:14,108
Soldier:
<i>Put 'em on the wagon!</i>

720

<i>There's more here.</i>
<i>Come on.</i>

( Chuckles )

723
00:49:21,383 --> 00:49:24,885
What do we have here?

724
00:49:24,919 --> 00:49:26,886
No!

725
00:49:26,921 --> 00:49:30,356
That's a fine
little blade.

726
00:49:30,391 --> 00:49:32,792
Maybe I'll pick
my teeth with it.

727
00:49:32,826 --> 00:49:34,627
I yield!
I yield!

728
00:49:34,662 --> 00:49:36,897
Amory:
<i>Round up any survivors.</i>

729
00:49:36,931 --> 00:49:38,999
We'll take them back
to Harrenhal.

730
00:49:39,033 --> 00:49:42,170
You heard him.
You're coming with us.

731
00:49:42,204 --> 00:49:44,706
I yield!

732
00:49:46,776 --> 00:49:49,044
( Whimpering )

733
00:49:49,078 --> 00:49:51,080
Help!

00:49:51,114 --> 00:49:53,216
Help me!

735
00:49:56,753 --> 00:49:58,454
Something wrong
with your leg, boy?

736
00:49:58,489 --> 00:50:00,490
Look at it.

737
00:50:08,332 --> 00:50:09,966
Can you walk?

738
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,735
No.
You got to carry me.

739
00:50:13,771 --> 00:50:15,939
All right.

740
00:50:23,447 --> 00:50:25,982
( Coughing )

741
00:50:29,254 --> 00:50:31,789
Carry him, he says.
( Laughs )

742
00:50:40,365 --> 00:50:42,766
We're looking for
a bastard named Gendry.

743
00:50:42,801 --> 00:50:45,803
<i>Give him up</i>

744
00:50:45,837 --> 00:50:48,105
or I'll start
taking eyeballs.

745
00:51:00,519 --> 00:51:02,186
You want Gendry?

746
00:51:05,624 --> 00:51:07,925
You already got him.

747
00:51:12,096 --> 00:51:14,598
<i>He loved that helmet.</i>
