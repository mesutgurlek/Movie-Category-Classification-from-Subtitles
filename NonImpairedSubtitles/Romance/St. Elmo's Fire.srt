1
00:01:31,761 --> 00:01:32,595
Excuse me.

2
00:01:32,804 --> 00:01:36,391
Wendy Beamish and William Hicks.
They were in a car accident.

3
00:01:36,683 --> 00:01:38,059
See the officer about that.

4
00:01:38,559 --> 00:01:39,727
Good evening.

5
00:01:40,019 --> 00:01:42,772
Alec Newberry.
Congressman Langston's office.

6
00:01:43,022 --> 00:01:45,566
lf l can be of any assistance....

7
00:01:45,942 --> 00:01:48,319
-Congressman who?
-Langston.

8
00:01:48,569 --> 00:01:49,904
Clear, please.

9
00:01:50,113 --> 00:01:51,197
Are they dead?

10
00:01:51,447 --> 00:01:53,241
-Hi, you guys.
-Wendy.

11
00:01:54,784 --> 00:01:56,661
-Wendy. You okay?
-l'm fine.

12
00:01:56,911 --> 00:01:58,287
l'm fine.

13
00:01:58,496 --> 00:02:02,250
The car my dad got me
for graduation is totalled.

14
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:07,130
Go find Billy.
See if you can sober him up.

15
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:10,216
He almost kills you,
and you're paying?

16
00:02:10,425 --> 00:02:13,761
Jules, please.
ls that your date?

17
00:02:14,012 --> 00:02:15,013
No.

18
00:02:15,888 --> 00:02:17,265
That is.

19
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:21,436
We're dealing with
a first-time offender here.

20
00:02:21,728 --> 00:02:25,231
Miss Beamish won't press charges,
so why not let it slide?

21
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,483
Forget it, counsellor.

22
00:02:28,776 --> 00:02:31,237
l wouldn't strike a match
near his blood.

23
00:02:36,326 --> 00:02:38,286
Okay, you're under arrest.

24
00:02:38,536 --> 00:02:39,787
Watch the sax.

25
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:42,290
Do you believe in premarital sax?

26
00:02:42,999 --> 00:02:46,252
May l assume the accident
left you injury-free?

27
00:02:46,502 --> 00:02:48,713
Billy, four months after graduation...

28
00:02:48,921 --> 00:02:52,091
...and you still act like
every night's a frat party.

29
00:02:53,217 --> 00:02:56,054
Aren't you even a little
concerned about Wendy?

30
00:02:57,805 --> 00:02:59,140
-How bad is it?
-Severe.

31
00:02:59,349 --> 00:03:02,685
She might have exceeded
the limit on her father's VlSA.

32
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:06,064
You're being arrested
for drunk driving.

33
00:03:06,356 --> 00:03:10,485
Drunk, definitely. l don't know
if you can call it driving.

34
00:03:13,154 --> 00:03:15,865
-Are you okay?
-l'm fine.

35
00:03:16,074 --> 00:03:17,950
l'm sorry, Wendy.

36
00:03:18,201 --> 00:03:19,994
We'll be right behind you.

37
00:03:21,371 --> 00:03:23,998
Alec, l've got a lot of cash.

38
00:03:33,049 --> 00:03:34,425
Dale?

39
00:03:34,842 --> 00:03:36,302
Dale Biberman.

40
00:03:37,428 --> 00:03:39,806
-Do you remember me?
-Yes, but l'm--

41
00:03:40,014 --> 00:03:41,182
Kirby Keager.

42
00:03:42,266 --> 00:03:44,811
You were a senior
when l started Georgetown.

43
00:03:45,103 --> 00:03:47,397
Right. Kirby. How are you?

44
00:03:47,605 --> 00:03:48,523
l graduated.

45
00:03:48,898 --> 00:03:50,692
l always knew you would.

46
00:03:50,983 --> 00:03:52,527
And l'm a lawyer.

47
00:03:54,904 --> 00:03:56,781
l mean, l'm a waiter...

48
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:59,033
...studying to become a lawyer.

49
00:03:59,951 --> 00:04:01,995
Dale Biberman.
l can't believe it.

50
00:04:02,245 --> 00:04:03,621
Still like Woody Allen?

51
00:04:03,871 --> 00:04:05,581
l've gotta go.
Nice seeing you.

52
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:13,172
Don't you worry.
Everything's gonna be all right.

53
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:55,339
-Hey, thanks for bailing me out.
-Again.

54
00:04:55,715 --> 00:04:57,592
When are you gonna get a car...

55
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,887
...that expresses your lifestyle
as the perfect couple?

56
00:05:01,137 --> 00:05:05,683
Not everyone got recruited out of
school into international banking.

57
00:05:05,933 --> 00:05:10,563
My parents gave me the car. l bet
l was conceived in the back seat.

58
00:05:10,855 --> 00:05:12,023
lt's still sticky.

59
00:05:12,315 --> 00:05:15,068
Wait till my father hears
the car is totalled.

60
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:20,198
Wally, undergrads
sitting at our table?

61
00:05:20,448 --> 00:05:24,911
-Only been there for 1 0 minutes.
-We've been here four years!

62
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:27,664
Kirbo, come here.
Where have you been?

63
00:05:27,914 --> 00:05:29,791
lt's busy. Where'd you go?

64
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:31,209
-The hospital.
-What?

65
00:05:31,459 --> 00:05:32,919
-The hospital.
-You sick?

66
00:05:33,169 --> 00:05:35,922
-lt was an emergency.
-You could have told me.

67
00:05:36,172 --> 00:05:38,466
-Gonna fire me?
-l fired you last week.

68
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,426
Blinding white light.

69
00:05:40,635 --> 00:05:41,886
Skid.

70
00:05:42,095 --> 00:05:43,471
Tree.

71
00:05:43,971 --> 00:05:44,806
lmpact.

72
00:05:45,056 --> 00:05:49,769
l was out of hand! lt was a
metaphysical-precision collision.

73
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:54,774
Was it beautiful for you too, Wendy?

74
00:05:54,982 --> 00:05:56,859
Somebody get me a screwdriver.

75
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:58,277
And a hammer.

76
00:05:59,946 --> 00:06:04,992
Of course, you do know what it means
to have drunk driving on your record?

77
00:06:05,451 --> 00:06:07,161
l'll never be a cop in D.C.

78
00:06:07,412 --> 00:06:08,496
Wally!

79
00:06:10,832 --> 00:06:11,666
Hi, Wal.

80
00:06:11,916 --> 00:06:12,917
Betrayed.

81
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:16,921
-So you're not angry?
-No, l'm not angry.

82
00:06:17,171 --> 00:06:20,174
Never trust a woman
who says she isn't angry.

83
00:06:20,508 --> 00:06:22,135
-Tell me about it.
-l'm not.

84
00:06:22,343 --> 00:06:26,806
You're the angry one. l thought
writing for the paper made you happy.

85
00:06:27,056 --> 00:06:30,476
-You should call your wife.
-l'll tell you something, Jules.

86
00:06:30,685 --> 00:06:33,146
Obituaries isn't writing.
All my characters die.

87
00:06:33,438 --> 00:06:36,065
l'd like to write about
the meaning of life.

88
00:06:36,566 --> 00:06:39,569
-You'll get a chance, Kevin.
-Don't hold your breath.

89
00:06:41,029 --> 00:06:42,030
Tommy.

90
00:06:42,238 --> 00:06:42,989
Who's that?

91
00:06:43,573 --> 00:06:47,493
Tommy Bancroft. Senator Hodges'
key guy. l want you to meet him.

92
00:06:47,702 --> 00:06:50,455
-And to be impressive.
-Oh, yes, sir.

93
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:53,833
The meaning of life,
Kevin, is fun, good times...

94
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:56,210
...a little H-U-M-O-R.

95
00:06:56,461 --> 00:06:59,005
Don't you enjoy anything anymore?
Like girls?

96
00:06:59,255 --> 00:07:03,468
l enjoy being afraid of Russia.
lt makes America feel better.

97
00:07:03,676 --> 00:07:06,512
Russia feels national
worth from our paranoia.

98
00:07:06,804 --> 00:07:07,889
-How's that?
-Good.

99
00:07:08,139 --> 00:07:11,559
Good. l have to check in
with the death squad now.

100
00:07:11,809 --> 00:07:13,186
-Did you see her?
-Who?

101
00:07:13,436 --> 00:07:14,896
-Dale Biberman.
-Who?

102
00:07:15,146 --> 00:07:18,399
No, l said l'm sorry l woke the baby.

103
00:07:20,485 --> 00:07:23,196
Well, l kind of got
in an accident.

104
00:07:25,281 --> 00:07:28,201
l know l don't have insurance.
Just stop shouting.

105
00:07:28,493 --> 00:07:30,286
l need the phone.

106
00:07:30,536 --> 00:07:33,206
-You gonna ask if l'm okay?
-Give me the phone.

107
00:07:33,414 --> 00:07:36,334
Kevin's here. He says
he wants to say hello.

108
00:07:38,878 --> 00:07:40,421
Hi, Felicia. How you doing?

109
00:07:40,671 --> 00:07:43,424
Me? Oh, you know,
it ain't easy being me.

110
00:07:43,675 --> 00:07:47,011
Will you give Billy a break?
He lost his job today.

111
00:07:47,261 --> 00:07:50,515
-The job Alec got for him?
-Yeah.

112
00:07:51,557 --> 00:07:54,268
-Did you give him any money?
-A little.

113
00:07:54,477 --> 00:07:55,937
Wendy!

114
00:07:56,229 --> 00:08:00,066
l thought you were cutting out
things that don't work in your life.

115
00:08:00,316 --> 00:08:02,193
Doesn't leave much.

116
00:08:02,568 --> 00:08:04,862
l better break this to Alec gently.

117
00:08:06,239 --> 00:08:08,700
This thing with Billy
is too destructive.

118
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:10,743
Life in the fat lane.

119
00:08:10,993 --> 00:08:13,037
Wendy, you're not fat.

120
00:08:13,871 --> 00:08:15,748
My thighs are fat.

121
00:08:16,207 --> 00:08:17,375
No diet works.

122
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:20,545
Only way to lose weight
in your thighs is amputation.

123
00:08:20,837 --> 00:08:24,674
-What you need to amputate is Billy.
-l know.

124
00:08:24,882 --> 00:08:26,592
l know, but l can't.

125
00:08:27,385 --> 00:08:28,845
l don't get it.

126
00:08:29,887 --> 00:08:30,805
Me neither.

127
00:08:31,973 --> 00:08:36,352
-How about we cut out of here?
-Well, l came with some girlfriends.

128
00:08:36,602 --> 00:08:38,896
Look, this face seats five.

129
00:08:39,772 --> 00:08:40,857
Excuse me.

130
00:08:42,025 --> 00:08:44,861
Could l see you
in the men's room, please?

131
00:08:45,111 --> 00:08:47,655
Sure. Wait,
it'll just be a second.

132
00:08:47,905 --> 00:08:49,157
Alec.

133
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:50,658
Alec!

134
00:08:53,328 --> 00:08:54,328
Excuse me.

135
00:08:57,957 --> 00:08:59,917
-What?
-Step into my office.

136
00:09:00,168 --> 00:09:01,335
A little pick-me-up?

137
00:09:01,586 --> 00:09:03,046
All right.

138
00:09:04,005 --> 00:09:06,632
Why didn't you tell me
you lost another job?

139
00:09:09,427 --> 00:09:12,597
For some insane reason,
l thought you'd take it badly.

140
00:09:12,847 --> 00:09:16,434
-Don't drown him. He's a father.
-That's right. You're a father.

141
00:09:16,684 --> 00:09:18,561
When are you gonna grow up?

142
00:09:18,811 --> 00:09:21,022
-This is mature, Al.
-l just get angry...

143
00:09:21,272 --> 00:09:23,483
...because you put
pressure on all of us.

144
00:09:23,691 --> 00:09:26,235
Working for Sen. Pomerantz
wasn't for me.

145
00:09:26,486 --> 00:09:29,822
-l'm so sorry.
-lt's all right. The wet look is in.

146
00:09:30,031 --> 00:09:32,867
-Asshole.
-That's Mr. Asshole to you.

147
00:09:38,414 --> 00:09:41,250
-How come they put ice in urinals?
-Tastes better.

148
00:09:58,017 --> 00:10:02,480
l like a girl who drinks

149
00:10:03,731 --> 00:10:06,484
Life for herjust can't begin

150
00:10:06,734 --> 00:10:09,112
Till she's had a double gin

151
00:10:09,362 --> 00:10:12,115
She's stuck to the chase
When she gets a taste

152
00:10:12,365 --> 00:10:16,119
Give her a little drop more

153
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:21,082
lf we could find the money, it would
be better to get a longer sofa.

154
00:10:21,332 --> 00:10:25,169
Tommy Bancroft said l could work
on the weekends for Hodges.

155
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:26,671
lt's a step up.

156
00:10:26,921 --> 00:10:28,798
lsn't Hodges a Republican?

157
00:10:29,007 --> 00:10:30,466
Oh, my God. You're right.

158
00:10:30,758 --> 00:10:35,054
What happened to that Alec Newberry
political conviction that l love?

159
00:10:35,346 --> 00:10:38,099
Working for a Republican senator
pays more...

160
00:10:38,349 --> 00:10:41,352
...than working for
a Democratic congressman.

161
00:10:41,561 --> 00:10:46,107
We could get the longer sofa,
and we could get married.

162
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:50,862
-Married? We just moved in together.
-l know. lt's great, isn't it?

163
00:10:53,197 --> 00:10:55,658
-We're not ready yet.
-Oh, l am ready.

164
00:10:58,077 --> 00:10:59,871
You're always ready.

165
00:11:07,462 --> 00:11:11,466
l'm gonna get you a red,
lacy babydoll nightgown.

166
00:11:11,966 --> 00:11:14,802
l'm happy in your pyjamas,
thank you very much.

167
00:11:15,053 --> 00:11:17,764
l'm happy when you're
out of my pyjamas...

168
00:11:18,056 --> 00:11:20,099
...thank you very much.

169
00:11:29,776 --> 00:11:31,402
You don't need that thing.

170
00:11:31,653 --> 00:11:35,156
We're getting married soon.
Let's play some Russian roulette.

171
00:11:35,406 --> 00:11:38,493
And who carries the bullet
around for nine months?

172
00:11:38,743 --> 00:11:40,286
Senator Hodges?

173
00:11:41,371 --> 00:11:42,455
Right.

174
00:11:47,835 --> 00:11:48,836
Jules.

175
00:11:49,796 --> 00:11:54,509
This scuzzy welfare hospital calls me.
Remember my father's second wife?

176
00:11:54,717 --> 00:11:55,551
My step-monster?

177
00:11:55,843 --> 00:11:58,846
The one who locked you in
the closet when you cried?

178
00:11:59,055 --> 00:12:04,102
She lost all my Dad's money, is on her
deathbed and puts me as her next of kin.

179
00:12:04,352 --> 00:12:05,728
What about your father?

180
00:12:05,979 --> 00:12:09,065
He's in South Africa
somewhere with his new wife.

181
00:12:09,315 --> 00:12:11,859
Who's just three years
older than l am.

182
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:15,363
lf l don't find him, l'll be
stuck paying for her funeral.

183
00:12:15,613 --> 00:12:18,074
ls there some insane
irony to this or what?

184
00:12:18,366 --> 00:12:19,534
Thanks, Alec.

185
00:12:20,243 --> 00:12:24,455
Alec is becoming a Republican,
and he wants to get married.

186
00:12:24,706 --> 00:12:25,623
Oh, my God!

187
00:12:25,873 --> 00:12:28,710
l always knew he was a Republican.

188
00:12:29,002 --> 00:12:30,628
What should l do?

189
00:12:30,878 --> 00:12:34,549
-l think you should have another shot.
-l think so too.

190
00:12:38,052 --> 00:12:42,098
You two were the couple always
most likely to couple, don't forget.

191
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:45,810
l'm sure your father will
take care of everything.

192
00:12:46,102 --> 00:12:49,355
Yes, just like he takes care
of everything else.

193
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:53,943
You're always coming to my rescue.
What can l say?

194
00:12:54,235 --> 00:12:56,446
l won't come
between two old roommates.

195
00:12:57,572 --> 00:12:58,573
Good night.

196
00:12:58,823 --> 00:13:00,366
Thanks, guys.

197
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:29,812
What you want

198
00:13:30,104 --> 00:13:32,065
Baby, l got it

199
00:13:33,191 --> 00:13:34,108
What you need

200
00:13:34,317 --> 00:13:36,277
You know l got it

201
00:13:36,527 --> 00:13:38,071
All l'm asking

202
00:13:38,321 --> 00:13:39,864
ls for a little respect

203
00:13:40,114 --> 00:13:42,408
When you talk to me, baby

204
00:13:53,669 --> 00:13:55,296
What's the meaning of life?

205
00:13:55,546 --> 00:13:56,923
Dale Biberman.

206
00:13:57,215 --> 00:13:58,383
Who?

207
00:13:59,008 --> 00:14:01,719
Dale Biberman. Didn't you
see her at the hospital?

208
00:14:01,969 --> 00:14:04,806
The girl l was in love
with when we were freshmen.

209
00:14:05,014 --> 00:14:09,477
She's about yea tall.
Long dark hair, beautiful face.

210
00:14:09,686 --> 00:14:13,815
Remember that big fountain?
The one on main campus that says...

211
00:14:14,065 --> 00:14:16,359
...'' Knowledge, Art, Religion, Life''?

212
00:14:16,609 --> 00:14:18,069
We walked past that...

213
00:14:18,277 --> 00:14:20,405
...she was sitting
on the '' Life'' side...

214
00:14:20,655 --> 00:14:23,825
...and she just smiled at me.

215
00:14:24,534 --> 00:14:26,577
What? You took her to one movie.

216
00:14:26,786 --> 00:14:30,540
Kevin, there are several
quintessential moments in a man's life:

217
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:32,834
Losing his virginity,
getting married...

218
00:14:33,084 --> 00:14:35,920
...fatherhood and the right girl
smiling at you.

219
00:14:36,212 --> 00:14:41,342
l'm not going another year finding
your unmailed love-scratchings around.

220
00:14:42,677 --> 00:14:44,637
l have her hospital schedule.

221
00:14:45,513 --> 00:14:48,433
-lt's true love, my friend.
-You know what love is?

222
00:14:49,017 --> 00:14:53,020
An illusion created by lawyers to
perpetuate the illusion of marriage...

223
00:14:53,271 --> 00:14:56,941
...and the reality of divorce
and the need for divorce lawyers.

224
00:15:02,071 --> 00:15:05,408
l just can't deal with
the little missis. Can l crash?

225
00:15:09,871 --> 00:15:13,041
You know, there are more
people in law school now...

226
00:15:13,249 --> 00:15:15,960
...than there are lawyers
on the entire planet.

227
00:15:16,169 --> 00:15:20,465
You're just bitter because
you have not had sex in, how long?

228
00:15:20,715 --> 00:15:25,428
A year? Refresh my memory. Haven't
you heard of the sexual revolution?

229
00:15:25,636 --> 00:15:27,847
Who won? Huh? Nobody.

230
00:15:28,139 --> 00:15:31,476
Sex used to be a free thing.
No more. Alimony. Palimony.

231
00:15:31,684 --> 00:15:35,813
-lt's all financial, an illusion.
-lt's the only one that counts.

232
00:15:36,064 --> 00:15:37,857
-Says who?
-Anyone who's been in love.

233
00:15:38,524 --> 00:15:39,609
Love sucks.

234
00:15:40,026 --> 00:15:41,402
So does your attitude.

235
00:15:57,919 --> 00:15:59,087
Thank you.

236
00:16:01,339 --> 00:16:05,176
You should have brought the red dress.
Red drives men wild.

237
00:16:05,468 --> 00:16:07,428
Hi, beautiful. Like Porsches?

238
00:16:08,554 --> 00:16:09,389
See?

239
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:11,766
l have a madman in my life already.

240
00:16:15,687 --> 00:16:17,647
lt's good, isn't it? l like it.

241
00:16:17,897 --> 00:16:21,401
lt's interesting.
l forgot to spin at the end.

242
00:16:22,944 --> 00:16:24,737
All right, l'll see you in a bit.

243
00:16:25,905 --> 00:16:28,116
Hey, Jules. Hey, how about a lift?

244
00:16:30,618 --> 00:16:32,912
-Hi, baby.
-Missed you.

245
00:16:33,204 --> 00:16:34,372
How'd you do?

246
00:16:34,872 --> 00:16:39,168
Well, thanks to Alec, l am now
an official pollster.

247
00:16:40,044 --> 00:16:44,340
Who wants to suck back a few
bloody marys at St. Elmo's, on me?

248
00:16:44,966 --> 00:16:48,803
-No. l have to work.
-Since when do you work on Saturdays?

249
00:16:49,053 --> 00:16:52,890
Since he started volunteer
moonlighting for Senator Hodges.

250
00:16:55,143 --> 00:16:58,813
Why is the president of
Georgetown's Young Democrats...

251
00:16:59,022 --> 00:17:00,648
...working for a Republican?

252
00:17:01,149 --> 00:17:02,942
Moving up, Kirbo.

253
00:17:06,029 --> 00:17:09,615
-Let's get trashed anyway!
-For a change.

254
00:17:16,039 --> 00:17:19,625
-You haven't seen it since l moved in.
-You moved in too?

255
00:17:19,917 --> 00:17:22,295
l only remember 800 pairs of shoes.

256
00:17:26,674 --> 00:17:28,384
So what do you think?

257
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:31,471
Very subtle.

258
00:17:32,347 --> 00:17:34,223
And very pink.

259
00:17:36,517 --> 00:17:37,352
Jules.

260
00:17:38,269 --> 00:17:40,480
Where do you get
the money for all this?

261
00:17:40,772 --> 00:17:44,984
Why do you think God invented credit?
For fabulous people like me.

262
00:17:45,234 --> 00:17:47,528
Would you fix us a drink?

263
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,406
Kev, l knew you'd like it.

264
00:17:50,656 --> 00:17:52,950
You have such sensitivity.

265
00:17:53,493 --> 00:17:58,539
Oh, by the way, l want you
to meet my decorator, Ron.

266
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:02,293
He's so fabulous, and he lives
right across the hall.

267
00:18:02,543 --> 00:18:04,003
Ron?

268
00:18:06,047 --> 00:18:07,423
Sit down. Let's relax.

269
00:18:07,673 --> 00:18:10,927
Jules, why do l feel like
l'm not here by accident?

270
00:18:15,515 --> 00:18:17,809
l have been needing to talk to you.

271
00:18:18,101 --> 00:18:20,937
l see one of our infamous
conversations is coming.

272
00:18:21,229 --> 00:18:23,606
Like when you decided
l was adopted.

273
00:18:23,898 --> 00:18:24,732
Remember that?

274
00:18:24,941 --> 00:18:28,111
l still think your mother's
hiding something from you.

275
00:18:30,613 --> 00:18:32,573
Kevin, l'm curious.

276
00:18:33,616 --> 00:18:36,369
You know all those nights
we stayed up talking?

277
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:40,748
How come you never made a pass at me?

278
00:18:44,627 --> 00:18:45,461
What?

279
00:18:46,254 --> 00:18:47,964
Don't you find me attractive?

280
00:18:48,214 --> 00:18:53,344
You know you're the only guy at school
who never made a pass at me?

281
00:18:54,387 --> 00:18:56,514
Well, l never joined the Army either.

282
00:18:56,764 --> 00:18:58,307
Kev, you've got a problem.

283
00:18:58,558 --> 00:19:01,811
You're gay, and you're
madly in love with Alec.

284
00:19:03,896 --> 00:19:04,731
l see.

285
00:19:05,231 --> 00:19:08,317
lt's okay. We all love Alec.
He's our hero.

286
00:19:08,568 --> 00:19:11,821
But he's very, very straight.
And very taken.

287
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:16,826
Jules, there's the brink of insanity,
and then there is the abyss...

288
00:19:17,076 --> 00:19:19,996
-...which you have fallen into.
-Don't be ashamed.

289
00:19:20,204 --> 00:19:23,291
-Gay became chic in the '70s.
-No, l'm not ashamed.

290
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:26,419
l am not gay.
And l am not staying.

291
00:19:26,711 --> 00:19:28,087
Kevin!

292
00:19:30,089 --> 00:19:31,883
Look at me. Are you hard? No.

293
00:19:32,091 --> 00:19:36,471
Let me just introduce you to Ron.
He's gay too, and he's so fabulous.

294
00:19:36,679 --> 00:19:39,057
Ron, Kevin's here!
Kevin, wait, please.

295
00:19:39,307 --> 00:19:42,477
l've seen enough pink for today,
thank you very much.

296
00:19:45,146 --> 00:19:48,900
He's just not ready to face
reality yet. l'll get back to you.

297
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:50,401
Please.

298
00:20:08,961 --> 00:20:11,255
Excuse me, sir.
We do not open until 1 1 .

299
00:20:11,547 --> 00:20:13,091
That's cool. l'll wait.

300
00:20:14,676 --> 00:20:16,052
Do you have a reservation?

301
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:20,014
lt's for Keager. Party of two,
1 :00. And l want this table.

302
00:20:21,224 --> 00:20:24,560
l'd be very happy to find
a lovely table for you...

303
00:20:24,769 --> 00:20:26,479
...but this is a table for four.

304
00:20:28,648 --> 00:20:30,358
Well, then l'll pay double.

305
00:20:30,608 --> 00:20:33,319
You could order a nice
Napa Valley chardonnay.

306
00:20:33,528 --> 00:20:36,447
Or if she's worth it,
get an import to impress her.

307
00:20:36,989 --> 00:20:38,157
Well, money's no object.

308
00:20:38,408 --> 00:20:39,242
Really?

309
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:43,371
Then Montrachet or Meursault.

310
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:46,666
And make sure you smell the cork.
So who is she?

311
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:47,792
Never mind.

312
00:20:49,085 --> 00:20:50,878
Thank God it's payday!

313
00:20:51,796 --> 00:20:54,799
Jules, you're advanced
on your salary by two months.

314
00:20:55,008 --> 00:20:57,927
-l have no check for you.
-Thanks, Jules. l owe you.

315
00:20:58,136 --> 00:21:00,596
That's good because
l owe everyone else.

316
00:21:05,059 --> 00:21:09,063
Judy, l have to pay for my stepmom's
funeral, then l'll catch up.

317
00:21:09,313 --> 00:21:12,567
l'm afraid you'll have to speak
with Forrester Davidson.

318
00:21:13,276 --> 00:21:15,236
The president of the bank?

319
00:21:20,533 --> 00:21:22,577
l'm sorry l'm late.

320
00:21:24,746 --> 00:21:26,122
Thank you.

321
00:21:26,331 --> 00:21:29,041
-Have you been waiting long?
-Just got here.

322
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:31,127
The food is great here.

323
00:21:31,336 --> 00:21:35,715
Yes, and l'll be having alfalfa
sprouts and a plate of mashed yeast.

324
00:21:35,965 --> 00:21:37,050
You're vegetarian?

325
00:21:38,509 --> 00:21:42,638
That's from Annie Hall. The movie
we saw together. Remember?

326
00:21:42,889 --> 00:21:45,641
That's funny. l thought we
saw a Mel Brooks movie.

327
00:21:45,892 --> 00:21:47,769
No, no. lt was Annie Hall.

328
00:21:54,567 --> 00:21:55,735
Miss Biberman?

329
00:21:56,861 --> 00:21:58,029
-Telephone.
-Thank you.

330
00:22:00,907 --> 00:22:04,243
Yes, doctor. l'm sorry.
l have to go to the hospital.

331
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:07,246
l hope we can do this again sometime.

332
00:22:07,497 --> 00:22:08,498
When?

333
00:22:08,706 --> 00:22:10,917
Why don't you call me?
l'm so sorry.

334
00:22:12,293 --> 00:22:13,461
Great.

335
00:22:16,547 --> 00:22:21,344
You're not going to med school to
impress a girl you're infatuated with?

336
00:22:21,552 --> 00:22:24,722
lt's not just infatuation,
and she's not just a girl.

337
00:22:24,973 --> 00:22:27,809
She's the only evidence
of God l can find.

338
00:22:28,059 --> 00:22:30,353
With the exception
of the mystical force...

339
00:22:30,645 --> 00:22:33,648
...that always removes one of
my socks from the dryer.

340
00:22:35,525 --> 00:22:37,402
Fluff and fold, buddy.

341
00:22:37,944 --> 00:22:41,364
As soon as l make it really big,
l'm going fluff and fold.

342
00:22:41,614 --> 00:22:42,448
Dreamer.

343
00:22:42,657 --> 00:22:47,036
-l understand fold, but what's fluff?
-Fluff's what l write for the paper.

344
00:22:49,205 --> 00:22:52,208
-What am l doing wrong here?
-Let me see.

345
00:22:57,255 --> 00:22:58,881
Listen, Les....

346
00:22:59,424 --> 00:23:01,884
You think my attachment
to Alec is unnatural?

347
00:23:02,093 --> 00:23:04,387
No. l think mine is.

348
00:23:04,637 --> 00:23:08,933
-He tell you he wants to get married?
-Four years ago, the day he met you.

349
00:23:09,225 --> 00:23:12,979
But he was a Democrat then.
Now he's a Republican, so who knows.

350
00:23:14,147 --> 00:23:16,691
God! How do women
do this every night...

351
00:23:16,899 --> 00:23:19,527
-...and not go insane?
-They are insane.

352
00:23:19,736 --> 00:23:23,489
Love, marriage, children,
relationships. lt's all insane.

353
00:23:24,866 --> 00:23:27,243
-You're okay.
-Thanks.

354
00:23:27,577 --> 00:23:32,290
My perfect sister and her perfect
husband are getting a perfect divorce.

355
00:23:32,999 --> 00:23:36,753
l have the perfect solution.
Stay away from love.

356
00:23:37,337 --> 00:23:38,880
l can't.

357
00:23:39,088 --> 00:23:40,631
Kevin, you've been in love.

358
00:23:40,923 --> 00:23:43,301
-Doesn't Alec hate peppers?
-Oh, come on.

359
00:23:43,801 --> 00:23:48,097
You must have been in love
with someone, sometime.

360
00:23:48,306 --> 00:23:49,223
Yeah, once.

361
00:23:51,726 --> 00:23:55,855
Junior high, l played bongos in a band,
and l fell in love with the singer.

362
00:23:56,147 --> 00:24:00,860
And she sang ''We've Only Just Begun''
as sweet as Karen Carpenter.

363
00:24:01,152 --> 00:24:05,615
One night, l got high on cheap malt
liquor, and l pledged my love to her.

364
00:24:05,865 --> 00:24:08,618
Next day she ran off with
a bassist named Ringo.

365
00:24:10,578 --> 00:24:14,248
So l turned in my bongos for
a battered Underwood typewriter.

366
00:24:14,457 --> 00:24:18,503
On which you'll type your way
to becoming one of the best...

367
00:24:18,711 --> 00:24:20,046
...writers in America.

368
00:24:21,381 --> 00:24:23,591
l wouldn't hold your breath.

369
00:24:23,883 --> 00:24:27,929
l can't even organize my thoughts
into anything for the paper.

370
00:24:28,137 --> 00:24:31,808
Kevin, you need to stop thinking
so much and fall in love again.

371
00:24:32,058 --> 00:24:33,226
Love sucks.

372
00:24:36,312 --> 00:24:37,772
Hi, guys.

373
00:24:39,399 --> 00:24:41,025
Rough day on the right wing?

374
00:24:42,777 --> 00:24:44,237
This is for me?

375
00:24:51,077 --> 00:24:52,412
Try it on.

376
00:24:53,079 --> 00:24:54,789
Kevin, stir the vegetables.

377
00:24:56,582 --> 00:24:57,750
Right.

378
00:24:59,502 --> 00:25:01,713
Leslie has to marry me soon.

379
00:25:01,921 --> 00:25:03,464
Why? Are you pregnant?

380
00:25:03,715 --> 00:25:05,341
What is your marriage hurry?

381
00:25:05,591 --> 00:25:06,759
l'm gonna kill myself.

382
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:08,636
lt's only peppers, Al.

383
00:25:09,137 --> 00:25:10,847
l can't believe what l did.

384
00:25:11,097 --> 00:25:13,141
l innocently go to buy the nightgown...

385
00:25:13,391 --> 00:25:17,312
...and this amazingly leggy blond
salesgirl offers to model it for me.

386
00:25:17,562 --> 00:25:21,149
So we do it in the dressing room
in front of a three-way mirror.

387
00:25:21,441 --> 00:25:22,817
So there were six of you.

388
00:25:25,403 --> 00:25:26,946
lf Leslie would just marry me.

389
00:25:27,155 --> 00:25:28,614
Marriage will make you faithful?

390
00:25:28,823 --> 00:25:29,657
Yes.

391
00:25:29,949 --> 00:25:32,785
The idea of marriage
was invented by people...

392
00:25:33,077 --> 00:25:36,998
...who were lucky to make it to 20
without being eaten by dinosaurs.

393
00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:38,833
Marriage is obsolete.

394
00:25:39,041 --> 00:25:42,462
Dinosaurs are obsolete.
Marriage is still around.

395
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:45,840
Alec, come here. This is obscene!

396
00:25:46,382 --> 00:25:47,842
l love it.

397
00:25:49,469 --> 00:25:51,346
Stir those vegetables.

398
00:25:54,265 --> 00:25:55,266
Don't look!

399
00:25:55,558 --> 00:25:57,435
Don't look.

400
00:26:00,855 --> 00:26:02,398
Oh, come on.

401
00:26:06,277 --> 00:26:07,528
-Kevin--
-l don't care.

402
00:26:07,779 --> 00:26:09,739
Get off!
He'll burn my vegetables!

403
00:26:10,031 --> 00:26:12,867
-No, he knows what he's doing.
-No, he doesn't.

404
00:26:14,202 --> 00:26:15,745
Get off of me!

405
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:21,000
Look at this creep.

406
00:26:27,882 --> 00:26:29,926
Hi, you want a date?

407
00:26:33,721 --> 00:26:37,475
-Hi, you want a date?
-Maybe later, baby.

408
00:26:40,603 --> 00:26:43,064
How come you never ask me
if l want a date?

409
00:26:44,023 --> 00:26:45,984
Because l thought you were gay.

410
00:26:49,195 --> 00:26:50,989
Why would you think l'm gay?

411
00:26:51,948 --> 00:26:56,160
Because l never see you with a girl.
And you always look real strange.

412
00:26:56,828 --> 00:27:00,498
l happen to be in love with someone,
only they don't know it, okay?

413
00:27:03,209 --> 00:27:06,963
Guess you wouldn't understand about
loving someone from afar, huh?

414
00:27:08,423 --> 00:27:11,843
Delaware's about as far
as l've ever been.

415
00:27:15,722 --> 00:27:19,142
ls this person a he or a she?

416
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:26,316
lt's a secret. l guess you
wouldn't understand that either.

417
00:27:26,524 --> 00:27:30,903
You know, darling, lots of people
come to me for love...

418
00:27:31,154 --> 00:27:33,531
...and it's a secret.

419
00:27:39,704 --> 00:27:40,788
Come back here.

420
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:45,251
This secret of yours, is it
a little one or a big one?

421
00:27:48,212 --> 00:27:50,423
Hey, you want a date?

422
00:28:02,727 --> 00:28:03,645
Alec Newberry.

423
00:28:03,895 --> 00:28:08,191
Hi, Alec. lt's Jules.
l'm over at the Van Buren Hotel.

424
00:28:09,108 --> 00:28:11,486
-What time is it?
-l don't know.

425
00:28:11,694 --> 00:28:14,447
These Arabs have been
forcing me to do coke...

426
00:28:14,697 --> 00:28:18,534
...all night. l don't
understand very much Arabic...

427
00:28:18,743 --> 00:28:21,746
...but l think l heard
the words for ''gangbang.''

428
00:28:22,038 --> 00:28:23,998
Alec, you gotta come get me.

429
00:28:24,207 --> 00:28:27,460
Please? l'm in the Potomac Suite.

430
00:28:28,711 --> 00:28:32,548
-Alec, you should be sainted.
-No, then l'd have to wear underwear.

431
00:28:33,257 --> 00:28:34,258
l love you.

432
00:28:34,509 --> 00:28:35,760
Then marry me.

433
00:28:46,187 --> 00:28:49,440
-Yes, who is it?
-Open the door!

434
00:28:53,653 --> 00:28:56,572
Alec, what are you doing here?

435
00:28:59,617 --> 00:29:03,287
They hardly impressed me
as the gang-bang type.

436
00:29:03,496 --> 00:29:07,166
-How much coke did you do?
-Don't know. They have barrels full.

437
00:29:07,417 --> 00:29:11,796
Jules, sometimes l think you
make these dramas up to test me.

438
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:16,551
Why don't you come over?

439
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:20,930
-l have to be at work in the morning.
-Come on.

440
00:29:21,139 --> 00:29:22,598
No.

441
00:29:23,766 --> 00:29:25,560
Well, l don't wanna be alone.

442
00:29:30,189 --> 00:29:31,274
Who are you calling?

443
00:29:31,482 --> 00:29:33,443
A systems analyst.

444
00:29:33,693 --> 00:29:35,236
A very hot Jewish guy.

445
00:29:35,445 --> 00:29:38,072
Are you the new Mideast ambassador?

446
00:29:39,115 --> 00:29:40,283
Let me drive you home.

447
00:29:40,491 --> 00:29:42,452
And waste all this good coke?

448
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,458
lt's Jules. Did l wake you?

449
00:29:50,043 --> 00:29:55,006
Our purpose is to get you off welfare
and train you in a skilled profession.

450
00:29:55,214 --> 00:29:57,675
Are you interested
in the janitorial field?

451
00:29:57,884 --> 00:29:59,260
Just give me my check.

452
00:30:00,928 --> 00:30:03,931
-There are some educational--
-Just give me my check.

453
00:30:09,645 --> 00:30:12,815
Get yourself some hot clothes,
and get yourself a man...

454
00:30:13,066 --> 00:30:15,610
...and you won't be worrying
about this shit.

455
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:34,337
Welfare recipients are
getting better-looking.

456
00:30:36,089 --> 00:30:39,509
You ever feel like you're not
accomplishing anything all?

457
00:30:40,593 --> 00:30:43,304
l think l'm in touch
with that emotion.

458
00:30:45,306 --> 00:30:46,391
Let's get a drink.

459
00:30:51,062 --> 00:30:54,315
Billy, how come you're not at work?

460
00:31:01,322 --> 00:31:05,868
And this is our first store,
built in 1953.

461
00:31:07,286 --> 00:31:09,163
We now have 24 Card-a-terias...

462
00:31:09,372 --> 00:31:14,085
...the largest greeting cards
franchise in the East.

463
00:31:14,836 --> 00:31:16,713
What line are you in?

464
00:31:18,005 --> 00:31:19,173
Munitions.

465
00:31:21,676 --> 00:31:23,136
Don't bring up moving out.

466
00:31:23,344 --> 00:31:26,264
Daddy'll have a heart attack
in front of your boyfriend.

467
00:31:26,514 --> 00:31:28,057
He's not my boyfriend.

468
00:31:28,307 --> 00:31:31,060
Well, then there's a nice
young guy working for us.

469
00:31:31,352 --> 00:31:33,896
-Howie Krantz.
-Libby, please.

470
00:31:34,147 --> 00:31:38,359
Candace, do like grandmother did.
ln the centre of the plate, neatly.

471
00:31:38,568 --> 00:31:40,028
Mom, you look beautiful.

472
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:43,156
l'm fat, l'm thin.
l'm blond, l'm brunette.

473
00:31:43,364 --> 00:31:47,910
Well, you always wanted to look
like Elizabeth Taylor, and now you do.

474
00:31:53,166 --> 00:31:56,252
My mother finds certain words
too horrible to utter...

475
00:31:56,502 --> 00:31:59,505
...so she whispers them.
You'll get used to it.

476
00:32:00,131 --> 00:32:02,175
Did you hear about Betty Rothberg?

477
00:32:02,383 --> 00:32:03,301
Cancer.

478
00:32:04,635 --> 00:32:07,347
Say, Bill, the day l married Rachael...

479
00:32:07,597 --> 00:32:11,809
...l got three Card-a-terias.
l just bought a new BMW.

480
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:13,436
How great!

481
00:32:13,686 --> 00:32:16,439
Betty's daughter moved
into the new neighbourhood.

482
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:18,983
Only six Jewish families.

483
00:32:19,275 --> 00:32:20,818
But very wealthy.

484
00:32:23,363 --> 00:32:25,239
Are you in the card game too?

485
00:32:25,448 --> 00:32:26,699
Six franchises.

486
00:32:27,575 --> 00:32:29,869
Where did you meet Wendy again?

487
00:32:30,787 --> 00:32:32,163
Prison.

488
00:32:32,413 --> 00:32:33,873
What did he say?

489
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:36,084
ls $200 enough?

490
00:32:36,501 --> 00:32:39,504
$200 is more than enough.
Thank you, Dad.

491
00:32:39,712 --> 00:32:40,713
Thanks.

492
00:32:40,922 --> 00:32:43,383
lf you'd get married
and run a franchise...

493
00:32:43,591 --> 00:32:45,718
...you wouldn't have to borrow money.

494
00:32:45,968 --> 00:32:48,805
l have a job with
the Department of Human Services.

495
00:32:49,013 --> 00:32:52,350
That isn't a job. lt's killing time
until you get married.

496
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,644
Thank you. l'm very committed.

497
00:32:54,852 --> 00:32:57,605
Daddy, l think l should
get my own apartment.

498
00:32:58,064 --> 00:32:59,315
Grandpa! Grandpa!

499
00:32:59,524 --> 00:33:01,818
-Billy's on the roof!
-What?

500
00:33:03,277 --> 00:33:05,488
Wait a minute. Wait, wait.

501
00:33:18,334 --> 00:33:20,294
This is so great!

502
00:33:21,045 --> 00:33:24,298
All the years we lived here,
no one ever did this.

503
00:33:24,841 --> 00:33:26,801
l used to do it all the time.

504
00:33:27,302 --> 00:33:32,181
At the frat house, l'd crawl out of
Alec's window on the roof with my horn.

505
00:33:32,473 --> 00:33:34,100
This is ridiculous!

506
00:33:35,101 --> 00:33:36,811
My God! Wendy's up there too!

507
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:38,396
Come on down here!

508
00:33:38,896 --> 00:33:41,607
l knew it the minute
he came in. Drugs!

509
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,694
Should we call the police
or fire department?

510
00:33:44,902 --> 00:33:47,113
Maybe we should let Wendy handle it.

511
00:33:51,784 --> 00:33:53,161
You miss school, don't you?

512
00:33:54,829 --> 00:33:55,997
Yeah.

513
00:33:59,375 --> 00:34:01,419
School was pretty out of hand.

514
00:34:07,884 --> 00:34:10,803
ln everyday life,
there's just no way...

515
00:34:11,053 --> 00:34:12,680
...to be out of hand.

516
00:34:13,389 --> 00:34:15,183
You gotta be so....

517
00:34:19,395 --> 00:34:22,065
You know, if it ever
got to be too much....

518
00:34:24,359 --> 00:34:25,610
Like just...

519
00:34:25,818 --> 00:34:27,278
...too much.

520
00:34:33,367 --> 00:34:35,578
Well, that's out of hand.

521
00:34:40,083 --> 00:34:41,334
Ever think about it?

522
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:43,961
Not while l'm still a virgin.

523
00:34:48,633 --> 00:34:50,260
Why didn't you tell me that?

524
00:34:51,886 --> 00:34:52,720
l don't know.

525
00:34:54,472 --> 00:34:57,558
Come on. l mean, all those
guys you went out with--

526
00:34:57,809 --> 00:34:58,893
Stuey Newman?

527
00:35:00,061 --> 00:35:01,854
Oh, please.

528
00:35:02,396 --> 00:35:04,190
You'd do it with Stuey Newman?

529
00:35:04,857 --> 00:35:06,025
Well?

530
00:35:20,039 --> 00:35:21,499
'' Be vewy quiet.

531
00:35:21,791 --> 00:35:24,001
l'm hunting wabbit.''

532
00:35:40,268 --> 00:35:41,519
Nice.

533
00:35:53,072 --> 00:35:54,615
l'm sorry.

534
00:35:55,575 --> 00:35:57,368
-Peace.
-l'm sorry.

535
00:36:04,333 --> 00:36:05,877
What the hell is that?

536
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:11,507
lt's your scuba suit.

537
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:21,517
l'm sorry. You're allowed
to have fun when you're screwing.

538
00:36:23,394 --> 00:36:24,854
Wend, l was--

539
00:36:25,062 --> 00:36:26,522
l'm sorry.

540
00:36:26,856 --> 00:36:29,692
l don't think we should
see each other anymore.

541
00:36:31,611 --> 00:36:32,612
What?

542
00:36:35,782 --> 00:36:37,575
There's your rent money.

543
00:38:10,126 --> 00:38:14,339
l wanna meet the woman who's
turning Kirbo Keager into a doctor.

544
00:38:14,589 --> 00:38:17,425
Hey, l've been an amateur
gynaecologist for years.

545
00:38:17,675 --> 00:38:18,927
Billy is great.

546
00:38:19,135 --> 00:38:20,678
He's unbelievable.

547
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:22,722
Leslie, did l tell you?

548
00:38:23,431 --> 00:38:27,101
l thought l was getting fired.
lnstead, my boss took me to dinner.

549
00:38:27,352 --> 00:38:31,898
-l told you not to bop your boss.
-Too late. l'm gonna dance.

550
00:38:44,827 --> 00:38:47,372
Can l borrow a key
to your apartment tomorrow?

551
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:48,581
What for?

552
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:52,543
The lingerie salesgirl has been
calling me at the office.

553
00:38:52,835 --> 00:38:56,255
-You gotta learn to say no.
-When Leslie says yes, l will.

554
00:38:56,464 --> 00:38:57,548
Wendy.

555
00:38:59,092 --> 00:39:01,761
-This is Howie Krantz.
-Howie, Kevin Dolenz.

556
00:39:02,011 --> 00:39:03,805
-How do you do?
-Alec Newberry.

557
00:39:04,013 --> 00:39:06,307
Nice to meet you.
You wanna sit with us?

558
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:08,393
Oh, great. That'd be great.

559
00:39:09,102 --> 00:39:12,688
-Thought you weren't coming here.
-We were passing by.

560
00:39:12,939 --> 00:39:17,151
l'm in the greeting cards business.
l work for Wendy's brother-in-law.

561
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:20,071
Humongous future in greeting cards.

562
00:39:51,102 --> 00:39:52,562
Ron!

563
00:40:00,612 --> 00:40:04,740
Everybody, this is my friend
and decorator, Ron Dellasandro.

564
00:40:04,949 --> 00:40:06,200
You remember Ron.

565
00:40:06,451 --> 00:40:08,077
-Hello, Ron.
-Hi, Ron.

566
00:40:08,327 --> 00:40:10,371
-Hi, Kevin.
-Hi, Ron.

567
00:40:10,622 --> 00:40:12,999
And this is Wendy and Howie.

568
00:40:17,795 --> 00:40:19,589
-Unbelievable.
-What?

569
00:40:20,423 --> 00:40:22,884
-So what's wrong?
-Billy's wife.

570
00:40:23,092 --> 00:40:24,093
Who's she with?

571
00:40:46,616 --> 00:40:47,950
Let's rock!

572
00:41:29,992 --> 00:41:31,786
Take your hands off my wife.

573
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:33,746
Your wife?

574
00:41:33,955 --> 00:41:37,458
You're not married to me.
You're married to your friends.

575
00:41:39,669 --> 00:41:42,296
l said get your hands off my wife.

576
00:41:43,214 --> 00:41:44,465
ls he kidding?

577
00:41:55,393 --> 00:41:57,103
Get him out of here!

578
00:41:57,437 --> 00:41:58,980
Yeah, you little shit!

579
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:00,148
You're a shit!

580
00:42:00,356 --> 00:42:01,441
You're fired!

581
00:42:01,691 --> 00:42:03,985
So are the rest of you.
Everybody out!

582
00:42:07,655 --> 00:42:10,032
-He's bleeding.
-Yes, l know. Come on.

583
00:42:11,367 --> 00:42:14,203
-Come on.
-l just had my nose done!

584
00:42:15,121 --> 00:42:16,497
Goddamn it!

585
00:42:16,748 --> 00:42:19,834
l tell you, l should've
had a vasectomy at birth.

586
00:42:20,418 --> 00:42:24,714
lf you ever have boys, do them a favour
and get them neutered right away.

587
00:42:25,131 --> 00:42:28,801
Because if they knock up some slut,
they're the ones who are fucked!

588
00:42:29,093 --> 00:42:30,970
l hate you, you little bitch!

589
00:42:32,013 --> 00:42:34,223
Listen, you stupid pig!

590
00:42:35,725 --> 00:42:37,435
Get off me! Get off of me!

591
00:42:58,456 --> 00:43:01,375
You just go ahead with
your evening with Howie.

592
00:43:01,626 --> 00:43:05,046
Yes. No matter what he looks like.

593
00:43:09,968 --> 00:43:11,761
Happy Halloween.

594
00:43:26,943 --> 00:43:29,153
Hi, secret love.

595
00:43:29,862 --> 00:43:33,616
Trick or treat?
Or tricks and treats?

596
00:43:34,575 --> 00:43:37,203
What would you say
the meaning of life is?

597
00:43:37,662 --> 00:43:40,373
Got 50 bucks? l'll show you
the meaning of life.

598
00:43:40,623 --> 00:43:42,166
l don't pay for sex.

599
00:43:42,375 --> 00:43:43,835
Oh, no?

600
00:43:45,128 --> 00:43:48,464
You think that
if you get a little wife...

601
00:43:48,756 --> 00:43:51,593
...or girlfriend that you don't pay?

602
00:43:51,801 --> 00:43:53,052
You pay.

603
00:43:53,761 --> 00:43:56,848
Then you can't be sure
you'll get it. With Naomi--

604
00:43:57,098 --> 00:43:58,641
Naomi?

605
00:43:58,933 --> 00:44:01,769
You pay, and you get it.

606
00:44:03,688 --> 00:44:06,149
You get it good.

607
00:44:08,526 --> 00:44:09,902
Food for thought.

608
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:12,238
Food for thought.

609
00:44:15,241 --> 00:44:17,910
l don't think l have
enough food to feed them.

610
00:44:18,161 --> 00:44:21,831
Oh, we'll have plenty.
We'll be fine. There'll be enough.

611
00:44:23,124 --> 00:44:24,917
What are you doing here?

612
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:28,129
We're taking you to lunch.
Le Petit Château.

613
00:44:28,337 --> 00:44:30,632
l can't leave and go to
Le Petit Château.

614
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:33,301
Ladies, please, have
a little perspective.

615
00:44:33,593 --> 00:44:35,386
Well, we could eat here.

616
00:44:35,678 --> 00:44:37,472
-We could?
-Yes.

617
00:44:38,056 --> 00:44:38,890
lt's nutritious.

618
00:44:39,098 --> 00:44:41,225
-Yes, it's an adventure.
-Grab a tray.

619
00:44:41,517 --> 00:44:43,061
lt is that.

620
00:44:43,603 --> 00:44:44,687
Take this.

621
00:44:47,857 --> 00:44:52,904
And for our entrée,
Campbell mushroom barley. How chic.

622
00:44:53,404 --> 00:44:56,908
Hi, Myra. Meet my friends
Leslie and Jules. This is Myra.

623
00:44:57,158 --> 00:44:58,326
Hi, Myra.

624
00:44:58,618 --> 00:45:00,161
You need some salad.

625
00:45:00,370 --> 00:45:01,829
How's Howie?

626
00:45:02,622 --> 00:45:06,292
Well, l wouldn't say
my father's trying to bribe me...

627
00:45:06,542 --> 00:45:10,213
...but he did offer me a convertible
if l'd get engaged to Howie.

628
00:45:10,505 --> 00:45:13,591
-Have you fucked him yet?
-Jules! God!

629
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:18,096
Get the car, fuck him, and if you
don't like it, break the engagement.

630
00:45:19,013 --> 00:45:20,807
Then you can still fuck him.

631
00:45:21,933 --> 00:45:23,309
-Sorry.
-Not funny!

632
00:45:23,601 --> 00:45:24,936
Sorry. Thank you.

633
00:45:31,734 --> 00:45:34,028
l don't wanna beat around the bush.

634
00:45:34,279 --> 00:45:37,532
We really came here because
we're both worried about you.

635
00:45:38,866 --> 00:45:42,912
No, Jules, actually that was a scam
that Leslie and l worked out...

636
00:45:43,204 --> 00:45:45,248
...because we're worried about you.

637
00:45:46,624 --> 00:45:47,458
Moi?

638
00:45:51,546 --> 00:45:52,463
So what's up?

639
00:45:53,047 --> 00:45:55,508
We're worried about
this affair with your boss.

640
00:45:56,593 --> 00:45:57,760
Forrester?

641
00:45:58,010 --> 00:45:59,720
Come on. He's wonderful.

642
00:45:59,929 --> 00:46:01,264
Forrester is married.

643
00:46:02,390 --> 00:46:04,017
Leslie, this is the '80s.

644
00:46:04,309 --> 00:46:09,021
l bop him, get his job when he gets
his hand caught in the vault...

645
00:46:09,272 --> 00:46:13,192
...become a legend, get caught in a
sex scandal, retire in disgrace...

646
00:46:13,401 --> 00:46:17,155
...write a bestseller and become
the host of my own talk show.

647
00:46:18,072 --> 00:46:19,866
Well, silly of us to worry.

648
00:46:20,158 --> 00:46:23,244
lt really is.
He's helped me so much.

649
00:46:23,453 --> 00:46:27,373
He's come up with so many alternatives
for my step-monster's funeral.

650
00:46:27,624 --> 00:46:28,875
That's another thing.

651
00:46:29,125 --> 00:46:33,254
You seem obsessed with
this woman dying. lt's creepy.

652
00:46:33,504 --> 00:46:37,342
lt turns out cremation is just
as expensive as the non-torch method.

653
00:46:37,592 --> 00:46:41,512
lf l don't come up with a cheaper
solution, l'll end up a bag lady.

654
00:46:41,763 --> 00:46:43,806
Of course, l'll have alligator bags.

655
00:46:46,851 --> 00:46:50,772
l've gotta go. l just remembered
l'm supposed to meet Forrester.

656
00:46:51,397 --> 00:46:52,940
You haven't eaten.

657
00:46:53,483 --> 00:46:56,986
l really didn't want any.
l'll talk to you guys later.

658
00:46:57,236 --> 00:46:58,488
Nice meeting you, Myra.

659
00:46:58,947 --> 00:47:02,366
l'll talk to you guys later, okay?
Sorry. l have to go.

660
00:47:05,953 --> 00:47:07,413
Oh, God.

661
00:47:07,872 --> 00:47:09,040
l told you.

662
00:47:10,124 --> 00:47:13,294
Why is it that you
and Jules and my mother...

663
00:47:13,544 --> 00:47:17,215
...and everyone l know are so sure
l should marry Alec?

664
00:47:17,507 --> 00:47:20,927
lf you and Alec don't get married,
l don't know who should.

665
00:47:21,177 --> 00:47:22,804
l love Alec.

666
00:47:23,554 --> 00:47:26,641
lt's scary to think of spending
my whole life with him.

667
00:47:26,891 --> 00:47:30,311
Then again, it's scary to think
of life without him too.

668
00:47:31,479 --> 00:47:34,482
Men: Can't live with them,
can't shoot them.

669
00:47:39,153 --> 00:47:40,530
Seen Billy?

670
00:47:41,197 --> 00:47:43,950
l wondered how long
it'd take till you asked me.

671
00:47:44,158 --> 00:47:46,619
l know. lt's like stopping smoking.

672
00:47:46,911 --> 00:47:50,164
l go as long as l can,
and then l just gotta have a hit.

673
00:47:50,832 --> 00:47:53,668
Alec's got him working
for this Korean gangster...

674
00:47:53,876 --> 00:47:56,796
...and l think Billy's
doing a really good job.

675
00:47:57,005 --> 00:47:58,339
Great.

676
00:47:58,589 --> 00:47:59,966
That's great.

677
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:02,427
What? lt's great.

678
00:48:19,027 --> 00:48:20,486
Kim....

679
00:48:21,654 --> 00:48:24,365
l thought you were
coming back on Thursday.

680
00:49:19,879 --> 00:49:21,506
Watch your step.

681
00:50:26,070 --> 00:50:28,531
Excuse me, sir,
do you have an invitation?

682
00:50:34,620 --> 00:50:35,705
Excuse me.

683
00:50:43,046 --> 00:50:44,047
Kirby!

684
00:50:44,797 --> 00:50:46,132
How are you?

685
00:50:46,341 --> 00:50:49,010
l'm obsessed, thank you very much.

686
00:50:50,219 --> 00:50:52,346
But you don't even know me.

687
00:50:53,222 --> 00:50:56,225
l'm very average. Full of flaws.

688
00:50:57,602 --> 00:51:01,272
l'm a slob.
l can't even make a bed straight.

689
00:51:04,650 --> 00:51:08,154
l steal People magazine
from my dentist's office.

690
00:51:10,364 --> 00:51:11,532
And look.

691
00:51:12,450 --> 00:51:14,827
l rarely take out the garbage.

692
00:51:15,703 --> 00:51:18,331
Here's my roommate, Judith.
She hates me.

693
00:51:19,207 --> 00:51:20,541
l hate her.

694
00:51:47,151 --> 00:51:49,279
And here's the worst of all.

695
00:51:50,405 --> 00:51:54,867
When l first decided to be a doctor,
l thought l wanted to serve people.

696
00:51:55,159 --> 00:51:56,619
But now, well...

697
00:51:56,828 --> 00:52:01,040
...l'm starting to feel that what
medicine's really all about is money.

698
00:52:04,085 --> 00:52:07,338
-Would you like some coffee?
-lt's money, isn't it?

699
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:11,634
That's what you're telling me.
lt's because l don't have any money.

700
00:52:12,176 --> 00:52:13,719
Thank you for being honest.

701
00:52:44,208 --> 00:52:46,502
The man, the myth, the legend!

702
00:52:46,711 --> 00:52:49,088
The one and only Billy the Kid!

703
00:53:07,732 --> 00:53:10,193
Seems like old times, huh, Billy-boy?

704
00:53:10,401 --> 00:53:11,486
Old times.

705
00:53:14,322 --> 00:53:16,616
Troy, man, l was thinking...

706
00:53:16,866 --> 00:53:20,203
...that maybe l could get
a job on campus...

707
00:53:20,411 --> 00:53:23,748
...with the students.
The fraternity, coaching. Anything.

708
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:27,043
We could use somebody like you
around here.

709
00:53:27,293 --> 00:53:30,630
-Really?
-We need somebody to get us drugs.

710
00:53:31,130 --> 00:53:33,508
Come on, let's go play some ball.

711
00:53:43,101 --> 00:53:44,811
What is that, your rattle?

712
00:53:47,271 --> 00:53:48,523
Hi, babe.

713
00:53:51,984 --> 00:53:53,695
Remember Ray Slater?

714
00:53:55,113 --> 00:53:57,949
The guy l was going out with
before l met you?

715
00:53:58,616 --> 00:54:00,993
Well, he came by to see me yesterday.

716
00:54:01,953 --> 00:54:03,997
He still wants to marry me.

717
00:54:05,081 --> 00:54:07,792
He said he'd take care
of me and Melody.

718
00:54:09,919 --> 00:54:11,170
Don't give up on me.

719
00:54:11,421 --> 00:54:14,424
We could probably
still get an annulment.

720
00:54:18,177 --> 00:54:19,178
l'm gonna change.

721
00:54:20,346 --> 00:54:22,390
l'm gonna get the right job.

722
00:54:24,267 --> 00:54:26,936
Look, there's gonna be
no more drinking.

723
00:54:27,645 --> 00:54:28,479
And no more women.

724
00:54:39,115 --> 00:54:42,368
You're not gonna believe
how out of hand it's gonna be.

725
00:54:43,786 --> 00:54:47,832
l work out of my house.
You must be available 24 hours a day.

726
00:54:48,082 --> 00:54:50,543
Complete discretion and loyalty.

727
00:54:50,877 --> 00:54:52,045
$500 a week.

728
00:54:52,837 --> 00:54:54,213
l'm your man, Mr. Kim.

729
00:54:54,630 --> 00:54:59,260
l must be able to trust you with
my house, my car, my private affairs.

730
00:54:59,886 --> 00:55:02,513
Look no further, Mr. Kim.
l'm your man.

731
00:55:08,227 --> 00:55:10,188
That's her.
Okay, now open the door.

732
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:12,356
Give me a break, will you?

733
00:55:12,565 --> 00:55:14,442
Get out and open the door.

734
00:55:14,692 --> 00:55:16,027
That's your job.

735
00:55:24,452 --> 00:55:25,703
What are you up to?

736
00:55:25,953 --> 00:55:29,624
l was handpicked as special attaché
to Mr. Kim Sung Ho.

737
00:55:29,874 --> 00:55:31,667
The famous Korean entrepreneur?

738
00:55:32,710 --> 00:55:34,170
What about medical school?

739
00:55:34,796 --> 00:55:38,925
Foolish pipe dream. l had to grab my
financial opportunities while l could.

740
00:55:39,342 --> 00:55:42,011
-lt's all about money, right?
-Well, good luck.

741
00:55:42,261 --> 00:55:46,015
l'm throwing a little party
at Kim's house on Saturday night.

742
00:55:46,265 --> 00:55:47,809
l'd like to see you there.

743
00:55:48,101 --> 00:55:49,811
Thanks, Kirby. l'll try.

744
00:55:50,395 --> 00:55:51,312
Good deal.

745
00:55:53,773 --> 00:55:56,484
Did you see her face?
She'll be there.

746
00:55:57,443 --> 00:56:01,823
Mr. Kim finds out you're having a
party, and you'll be out in the street.

747
00:56:02,115 --> 00:56:03,908
No way.
He won't be home until Sunday.

748
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:07,453
Besides, there's an extra $1 00
for you to keep your mouth shut.

749
00:56:17,964 --> 00:56:21,384
So does this mean that
you're officially engaged?

750
00:56:22,468 --> 00:56:23,302
Well....

751
00:56:23,511 --> 00:56:25,555
lt means l'm officially
thinking about it.

752
00:56:25,805 --> 00:56:30,101
What is this? Didn't you think women
were always dying to get married?

753
00:56:30,351 --> 00:56:31,894
Not to me.

754
00:56:37,108 --> 00:56:38,568
Oh, God, look at this.

755
00:56:38,818 --> 00:56:39,986
You look great.

756
00:56:40,278 --> 00:56:43,197
Where's the beautiful doctor
we've been hearing about?

757
00:56:43,489 --> 00:56:45,032
-On her way.
-You are so wrong.

758
00:56:45,283 --> 00:56:49,579
College is a four-year delusion so
you don't have to deal with reality.

759
00:56:49,787 --> 00:56:53,041
You're lambs waiting to be
slaughtered, you undergrads.

760
00:56:53,291 --> 00:56:55,668
l take it medical school is now out.

761
00:56:55,918 --> 00:56:58,755
Absolutely.
l am now a student of life.

762
00:57:08,389 --> 00:57:11,142
This is my friend Howie Krantz.
Billy Hicks.

763
00:57:11,434 --> 00:57:12,435
Hi, Billy.

764
00:57:13,811 --> 00:57:15,855
We'll see you a little later.

765
00:57:18,524 --> 00:57:19,776
A friend of yours?

766
00:57:20,443 --> 00:57:25,573
Billy, l want you to know l'm not
gonna be getting you any more jobs.

767
00:57:26,324 --> 00:57:30,244
Al, you're so perfect.
Such a young god.

768
00:57:30,453 --> 00:57:32,163
You not only have the right stuff...

769
00:57:32,372 --> 00:57:34,999
...you have the right job
and the right hair.

770
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:37,293
l, of course, have the wrong hair.

771
00:57:37,585 --> 00:57:41,255
Forrester said he wanted to know what
l'm looking for in this relationship.

772
00:57:41,506 --> 00:57:45,426
So l told him love, companionship
and the vice-presidency.

773
00:57:46,552 --> 00:57:49,389
Sounds like you have your boss
wrapped around your finger.

774
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:52,934
l ever tell you what he likes me
to do with my finger?

775
00:57:53,267 --> 00:57:56,270
-How's your stepmother?
-Hanging on, the old witch.

776
00:57:56,562 --> 00:57:59,649
l found this place in California
called the Neptune Society.

777
00:57:59,941 --> 00:58:02,944
They just wrap her up and feed her
to the sharks for $500.

778
00:58:03,236 --> 00:58:04,946
l just have to ship her there.

779
00:58:05,238 --> 00:58:06,489
She's worse.

780
00:58:06,739 --> 00:58:09,033
lt's gonna be a long night.

781
00:58:10,451 --> 00:58:13,621
Yeah, hi. By any chance,
did Dale Biberman...

782
00:58:13,871 --> 00:58:16,332
...get called in
on an emergency duty tonight?

783
00:58:20,253 --> 00:58:21,337
Okay. Thanks.

784
00:58:31,097 --> 00:58:33,057
-So how you doing?
-Fine.

785
00:58:35,810 --> 00:58:36,978
You still live at home?

786
00:58:37,395 --> 00:58:39,188
Yeah. How about you?

787
00:58:40,565 --> 00:58:42,191
Felicia hasn't kicked me out yet.

788
00:58:45,069 --> 00:58:46,446
Been playing your sax?

789
00:58:48,322 --> 00:58:50,032
l hocked it to pay the bills.

790
00:59:04,756 --> 00:59:08,885
Have you forgiven me for being
such a horse's ass?

791
00:59:09,594 --> 00:59:11,637
There's nothing to forgive.

792
00:59:12,847 --> 00:59:14,724
Actually, l should thank you.

793
00:59:15,433 --> 00:59:19,729
lt helped me grow up a lot,
made me see how stupid l was being.

794
00:59:20,021 --> 00:59:21,731
Trusting a guy like me.

795
00:59:24,567 --> 00:59:26,194
You're very talented.

796
00:59:31,783 --> 00:59:33,743
So are you still...

797
00:59:33,993 --> 00:59:34,827
...a virgin?

798
00:59:38,456 --> 00:59:39,916
That's none of your business.

799
00:59:46,506 --> 00:59:50,635
l want you to make another emergency
breakthrough. Do you hear me?

800
00:59:50,885 --> 00:59:53,262
She won't release it?
Did you tell her who's calling?

801
00:59:53,554 --> 00:59:56,808
Did you tell her l was giving
a goddamn party for her?

802
01:00:01,813 --> 01:00:04,732
Make room.
The kid can't fly on one wing.

803
01:00:04,982 --> 01:00:06,234
Come to Mama.

804
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:08,361
Quiet, please!

805
01:00:09,570 --> 01:00:10,822
Quiet, please!

806
01:00:11,697 --> 01:00:13,574
Quiet, please. Everyone!

807
01:00:14,951 --> 01:00:15,785
Thank you.

808
01:00:16,035 --> 01:00:18,329
Big Al has an announcement to make!

809
01:00:18,621 --> 01:00:20,999
Oh, well, now we're excited.

810
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:24,710
On June 1 ...

811
01:00:25,294 --> 01:00:27,505
...Leslie Hunter will do me
the long...

812
01:00:27,714 --> 01:00:31,050
...long, long-awaited honour...

813
01:00:31,509 --> 01:00:32,885
...of becoming my bride.

814
01:00:34,762 --> 01:00:36,639
You're all invited!

815
01:00:36,973 --> 01:00:38,141
Thank you very much.

816
01:00:38,349 --> 01:00:40,893
Howie, let's make this
a double wedding.

817
01:00:49,235 --> 01:00:51,696
What's the matter with you?
Cut it out!

818
01:00:51,904 --> 01:00:54,740
We discussed this at home.
Now you completely discount me!

819
01:00:54,991 --> 01:00:58,661
l'm just trying to facilitate
the marriage process.

820
01:00:58,953 --> 01:01:00,663
You want marriage...

821
01:01:00,913 --> 01:01:04,417
...or a Christmas card with
the Newberrys in front of a fireplace?

822
01:01:04,709 --> 01:01:06,085
You're afraid to commit!

823
01:01:06,711 --> 01:01:08,504
No, l'm not afraid to commit.

824
01:01:09,464 --> 01:01:13,843
l have to have something for myself
first before l can share it with you.

825
01:01:14,093 --> 01:01:16,053
Will you just for once...

826
01:01:16,304 --> 01:01:20,433
...not use as the excuse for not
marrying me your goddamn career?

827
01:01:20,892 --> 01:01:23,186
Fine. All right then.

828
01:01:25,313 --> 01:01:27,356
l have a better excuse.

829
01:01:29,442 --> 01:01:32,779
What are we going to do about
your extracurricular love life?

830
01:01:35,490 --> 01:01:37,950
What extracurricular love life?

831
01:01:39,660 --> 01:01:41,371
Alec, come on.

832
01:01:46,584 --> 01:01:48,628
What did Kevin tell you?

833
01:01:51,339 --> 01:01:52,507
Nothing.

834
01:02:06,104 --> 01:02:07,563
What did you tell her?

835
01:02:07,772 --> 01:02:09,232
What did you tell her?

836
01:02:09,482 --> 01:02:11,025
He told me nothing.

837
01:02:11,567 --> 01:02:13,277
lt was just a hunch...

838
01:02:13,945 --> 01:02:14,862
...until now.

839
01:02:26,666 --> 01:02:29,585
l want you out of
the apartment tonight.

840
01:02:37,260 --> 01:02:38,261
Are you okay?

841
01:02:38,553 --> 01:02:39,554
That's okay.

842
01:02:40,096 --> 01:02:43,016
lt's cool. lt ain't a party
till something gets broken.

843
01:02:44,100 --> 01:02:45,643
We're swinging now.

844
01:02:52,275 --> 01:02:54,485
Get off the phone and open this door!

845
01:02:54,736 --> 01:02:57,488
Are you the maniac that's been
trying to cut in on my line?

846
01:02:57,739 --> 01:02:58,906
l should have known.

847
01:02:59,365 --> 01:03:00,283
Where's Dale?

848
01:03:00,575 --> 01:03:02,201
She went skiing.

849
01:03:02,452 --> 01:03:04,162
What do you mean? Where?

850
01:03:04,579 --> 01:03:06,039
Why should l tell you?

851
01:03:06,289 --> 01:03:09,876
Because l'm not responsible
for what l'll do to you if you don't.

852
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:16,633
Which one is yours?
l always forget.

853
01:03:17,050 --> 01:03:18,509
So do l.

854
01:03:20,762 --> 01:03:21,763
Let's get a drink.

855
01:03:23,181 --> 01:03:24,349
You wanna?

856
01:03:26,017 --> 01:03:28,144
Yeah, l do.
l've had a shit day.

857
01:03:28,394 --> 01:03:30,104
l've had a shit year.

858
01:03:30,897 --> 01:03:31,814
Where should we go?

859
01:03:33,399 --> 01:03:35,777
l think the bars are closed.

860
01:03:37,445 --> 01:03:38,613
Your place?

861
01:03:39,239 --> 01:03:40,615
Okay.

862
01:03:48,414 --> 01:03:51,501
You have really grown
into a fine-looking woman.

863
01:03:54,962 --> 01:03:56,839
l don't feel very fine-looking.

864
01:04:00,093 --> 01:04:03,346
There's something l've been
wanting to ask you all night.

865
01:04:06,307 --> 01:04:08,768
What you got on underneath that skirt?

866
01:04:10,395 --> 01:04:11,646
You should know.

867
01:04:28,329 --> 01:04:29,163
Okay, Billy.

868
01:04:31,958 --> 01:04:34,252
Come on.
Don't save it for your boss.

869
01:04:37,547 --> 01:04:39,007
Can you keep a secret?

870
01:04:39,257 --> 01:04:41,384
l have kept many secrets.

871
01:04:42,010 --> 01:04:43,886
Billy, enough.

872
01:04:44,178 --> 01:04:45,555
Enough!

873
01:04:45,972 --> 01:04:46,806
Says who?

874
01:04:48,057 --> 01:04:48,891
l say.

875
01:04:49,309 --> 01:04:51,436
-Oh, you say.
-That's right.

876
01:04:51,686 --> 01:04:54,605
You wouldn't have so much
to say with me in your mouth.

877
01:04:54,897 --> 01:04:57,191
l'm serious. l said no!

878
01:05:09,203 --> 01:05:10,580
Give me my keys.

879
01:05:13,499 --> 01:05:14,667
Come and get them.

880
01:05:15,501 --> 01:05:17,462
You shit, give me my keys!

881
01:05:17,754 --> 01:05:20,506
-Come here.
-No! Give me my keys!

882
01:05:21,633 --> 01:05:22,467
Come on!

883
01:05:23,468 --> 01:05:24,927
l'm getting a boner now!

884
01:05:29,140 --> 01:05:30,516
-Yes.
-Give me the keys!

885
01:05:30,808 --> 01:05:31,809
l love it!

886
01:05:33,895 --> 01:05:35,605
Give me my keys.

887
01:05:36,230 --> 01:05:38,941
Oh, watch the crease.
Watch the crease.

888
01:05:39,484 --> 01:05:40,943
l needed a friend tonight.

889
01:05:42,487 --> 01:05:46,240
Get back in the Jeep and assume
the missionary position.

890
01:05:49,327 --> 01:05:50,870
You break my heart.

891
01:05:54,749 --> 01:05:57,460
Then again, you break
everyone's heart.

892
01:06:09,389 --> 01:06:11,349
Hey, Jules, l'm sorry!

893
01:06:25,154 --> 01:06:26,239
l'm sorry.

894
01:07:12,118 --> 01:07:14,162
-Who is it?
-ls Dale Biberman there?

895
01:07:14,370 --> 01:07:16,247
-Who wants to know?
-Kirby Keager!

896
01:07:18,499 --> 01:07:20,293
-Who the hell are you?
-Who the hell are you?

897
01:07:21,127 --> 01:07:23,421
Kirby! What are you doing here?

898
01:07:30,178 --> 01:07:31,095
Who is that?

899
01:07:31,345 --> 01:07:34,098
-Stop him, Guy. Will you?
-l'm buck naked.

900
01:07:34,349 --> 01:07:36,643
Kirby, stop! Come inside!

901
01:07:41,314 --> 01:07:43,107
This guy is crazy.

902
01:07:52,575 --> 01:07:55,828
You've got no snow tires or chains.
You've got no traction.

903
01:07:56,120 --> 01:07:57,580
Kirby, please.

904
01:07:58,039 --> 01:08:00,416
You won't get out of here tonight.
Come inside.

905
01:08:01,083 --> 01:08:02,251
l'll stay in the car!

906
01:08:03,252 --> 01:08:06,255
-He wants to stay in the car.
-He'll freeze.

907
01:08:07,298 --> 01:08:08,675
People have died out here.

908
01:08:09,175 --> 01:08:12,845
So just leave me alone!
Get away from me and leave me alone!

909
01:08:16,057 --> 01:08:17,517
Please come inside.

910
01:08:28,569 --> 01:08:30,279
l haven't been here for a while.

911
01:08:30,530 --> 01:08:33,616
lt's still the same.
Small and ugly.

912
01:08:34,117 --> 01:08:37,453
But then again,
it is small and ugly. Here.

913
01:08:37,662 --> 01:08:40,498
You sure you don't want to go
to some nice ladylike hotel?

914
01:08:40,748 --> 01:08:42,000
l'll be fine here.

915
01:08:42,250 --> 01:08:45,336
As long as l'm not putting you
or Kirbo to any trouble.

916
01:08:45,628 --> 01:08:46,963
No, it's fine.

917
01:08:48,631 --> 01:08:50,091
ls that a coffin?

918
01:08:50,383 --> 01:08:53,219
l thought girls would think
it was sexy.

919
01:08:53,511 --> 01:08:54,679
And do they?

920
01:08:55,763 --> 01:08:57,390
How would l know?

921
01:08:58,057 --> 01:09:02,353
You better not let Jules see it.
She'll steal it for her stepmother.

922
01:09:02,645 --> 01:09:04,272
You wanna sit down there?

923
01:09:08,442 --> 01:09:10,319
When did you win
these writing awards?

924
01:09:10,570 --> 01:09:14,157
Oh, never. They're more effect
to impress young ladies.

925
01:09:15,366 --> 01:09:17,160
l did win something.

926
01:09:18,036 --> 01:09:19,495
ln eighth grade...

927
01:09:19,996 --> 01:09:21,623
...l won Best Haiku Poem.

928
01:09:21,873 --> 01:09:24,083
l beat out David Autry.

929
01:09:24,500 --> 01:09:26,127
Quite a thrill.

930
01:09:27,044 --> 01:09:31,424
So l've wandered into a real
woman trap here, haven't l?

931
01:09:33,885 --> 01:09:37,138
Only you're the first woman,
and l blew all my props already.

932
01:09:37,388 --> 01:09:39,098
You want some brandy?

933
01:09:39,807 --> 01:09:40,725
Good.

934
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:12,673
Am l part of your props?

935
01:10:26,729 --> 01:10:28,940
Your clothes should be dry
in a few hours.

936
01:10:29,148 --> 01:10:31,901
-He's a doctor, isn't he?
-And here are some pyjamas.

937
01:10:34,028 --> 01:10:35,905
You expect me to wear his pyjamas?

938
01:10:37,532 --> 01:10:39,575
We'll talk in the morning.

939
01:11:03,516 --> 01:11:05,560
Alec was the first.

940
01:11:05,810 --> 01:11:07,061
You know?

941
01:11:07,604 --> 01:11:12,066
l mean, there were other guys
for me in high school.

942
01:11:12,316 --> 01:11:13,568
Boys.

943
01:11:16,654 --> 01:11:19,824
Alec was the first love of my life.

944
01:11:23,036 --> 01:11:27,081
l sometimes think if we hadn't
ended up in the same dorm...

945
01:11:28,583 --> 01:11:30,960
...l would have just met someone else.

946
01:11:31,168 --> 01:11:32,003
So would he.

947
01:11:37,341 --> 01:11:40,678
Alec had the luck of geography, right?

948
01:11:43,890 --> 01:11:46,643
Whatever we say about Alec
we'll regret tomorrow.

949
01:11:48,478 --> 01:11:49,479
Tell me something.

950
01:11:52,148 --> 01:11:55,401
What do you think about
our relationship as an outsider?

951
01:11:55,651 --> 01:11:57,779
l want you to be honest.

952
01:11:58,196 --> 01:12:00,490
-Really.
-You want me to be honest?

953
01:12:00,698 --> 01:12:02,158
l don't know.

954
01:12:10,375 --> 01:12:12,001
Dangerous question.

955
01:12:12,251 --> 01:12:16,714
Well, l think l hang around you guys
so much, personally...

956
01:12:18,508 --> 01:12:21,135
...because, well,
you're all l think about.

957
01:12:23,846 --> 01:12:24,931
Me?

958
01:12:30,395 --> 01:12:34,232
And l think that the reason
l'm not interested in other women...

959
01:12:34,482 --> 01:12:37,110
...and why l haven't had sex
in so long...

960
01:12:38,945 --> 01:12:40,905
...is because l am...

961
01:12:41,864 --> 01:12:44,242
...desperately, completely...

962
01:12:45,535 --> 01:12:47,328
...in love with you.

963
01:13:00,550 --> 01:13:03,261
We won't even remember this
tomorrow, huh?

964
01:13:09,309 --> 01:13:11,019
lt is tomorrow.

965
01:13:19,819 --> 01:13:22,905
Oh, l love you!
l've always loved you!

966
01:13:23,990 --> 01:13:26,826
-Oh, l'm sorry!
-No, no, l love it! l love it!

967
01:13:27,535 --> 01:13:30,163
-What are you doing?
-Nothing. Where is this thing?

968
01:13:30,413 --> 01:13:32,707
-lt's in the front.
-Okay. Wait.

969
01:14:15,500 --> 01:14:17,710
l broke your shower!

970
01:14:42,193 --> 01:14:44,237
l gave him a key.

971
01:14:46,572 --> 01:14:49,200
l'm only gonna ask you this once.

972
01:14:53,454 --> 01:14:56,708
Did you tell Leslie
about my screwing around?

973
01:14:57,625 --> 01:14:58,626
No.

974
01:15:01,045 --> 01:15:02,839
l believe you.

975
01:15:03,673 --> 01:15:08,553
l want you to know that l believe you,
and l'm sorry l hit you.

976
01:15:17,437 --> 01:15:19,230
l don't think...

977
01:15:22,024 --> 01:15:27,071
...that l am ever gonna be able
to get Leslie back.

978
01:15:30,283 --> 01:15:31,367
Buddy...

979
01:15:31,659 --> 01:15:33,453
...l kind of got some company.

980
01:15:33,703 --> 01:15:35,413
Oh, Jesus.

981
01:15:37,207 --> 01:15:39,000
-l'm sorry.
-lt's all right.

982
01:15:39,959 --> 01:15:42,712
-l never thought....
-l'll call you tomorrow.

983
01:15:42,920 --> 01:15:45,923
-l never thought it was possible.
-Let me call you.

984
01:15:46,132 --> 01:15:48,426
-Hey, just a minute. Tell me.
-What?

985
01:15:49,302 --> 01:15:53,222
-ls it the fat chick from the party?
-Let me call you later.

986
01:15:53,765 --> 01:15:55,475
Come on. Come on.

987
01:15:57,310 --> 01:16:00,396
l have to know.
ls it the fat chick from the party?

988
01:16:05,693 --> 01:16:07,570
lt's not the fat chick.

989
01:16:14,744 --> 01:16:16,704
No way that this is happening.

990
01:16:18,957 --> 01:16:20,833
lt happened.

991
01:16:23,711 --> 01:16:24,712
-Alec--
-Shut up!

992
01:17:13,177 --> 01:17:15,805
Where is Kirby Keager?

993
01:17:20,268 --> 01:17:22,228
He took my new car.

994
01:17:27,942 --> 01:17:29,318
lt started!

995
01:17:30,194 --> 01:17:33,698
You better hurry up before
it starts snowing again.

996
01:17:43,833 --> 01:17:45,793
So drive carefully.

997
01:17:46,544 --> 01:17:48,087
Nice meeting you.

998
01:17:51,549 --> 01:17:56,429
Honey, l'll get the camera,
and we'll take a photo of you guys.

999
01:17:59,015 --> 01:18:03,144
l don't really know you that well,
but you seem like a fine person.

1000
01:18:03,394 --> 01:18:06,564
And l want you to know
l'm flattered by all this.

1001
01:18:08,774 --> 01:18:11,068
Deep down, l'm sure for a long time...

1002
01:18:11,319 --> 01:18:14,030
...l'll wonder if maybe
this isn't my loss.

1003
01:18:57,031 --> 01:18:58,282
Smile.

1004
01:19:02,245 --> 01:19:03,621
There you are.

1005
01:19:10,878 --> 01:19:12,130
Later, dude.

1006
01:20:08,520 --> 01:20:09,895
Hi, Daddy.

1007
01:20:14,734 --> 01:20:16,778
This is some neighbourhood.

1008
01:20:17,445 --> 01:20:19,322
Did you get your car fixed?

1009
01:20:19,739 --> 01:20:22,367
l got a personal letter
from Lee lacocca.

1010
01:20:24,118 --> 01:20:26,788
l did.
They fixed everything for nothing.

1011
01:20:27,247 --> 01:20:28,414
Good.

1012
01:20:28,957 --> 01:20:30,583
But l can't keep it.

1013
01:20:31,709 --> 01:20:35,755
l can't drive that car and work
with people who can't afford to eat.

1014
01:20:36,422 --> 01:20:39,509
Keep the car.
You and Howie will need it.

1015
01:20:41,386 --> 01:20:42,637
Well, Daddy...

1016
01:20:44,013 --> 01:20:46,224
...l'm giving Howie back too.

1017
01:20:48,476 --> 01:20:50,103
l don't love Howie.

1018
01:20:50,895 --> 01:20:52,271
Well, we learn to love.

1019
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:55,316
l mean, there's marriage
and there's family...

1020
01:20:56,442 --> 01:20:57,902
...and the family business.

1021
01:20:58,194 --> 01:21:00,154
That's what's important.

1022
01:21:00,905 --> 01:21:03,116
l have my own job.

1023
01:21:03,992 --> 01:21:06,744
And l want to get my own apartment.

1024
01:21:07,078 --> 01:21:09,539
But you can keep your job
until you're pregnant.

1025
01:21:11,416 --> 01:21:14,502
l mean, Howie's a fine boy...

1026
01:21:15,086 --> 01:21:17,713
...and l don't think
you need your own apartment.

1027
01:21:19,006 --> 01:21:21,926
-Do you ever hear me?
-Well, l do.

1028
01:21:22,135 --> 01:21:23,678
l don't love Howie.

1029
01:21:26,264 --> 01:21:27,724
l don't love him.

1030
01:21:29,267 --> 01:21:30,351
l love Billy.

1031
01:21:31,144 --> 01:21:32,395
Billy from the roof?

1032
01:22:17,857 --> 01:22:20,860
l took off work because
l thought you wouldn't be here.

1033
01:22:21,110 --> 01:22:22,195
l'm sick.

1034
01:22:23,988 --> 01:22:24,822
What's wrong?

1035
01:22:25,031 --> 01:22:26,741
Just sickness.

1036
01:22:35,541 --> 01:22:37,418
You can't have the Pretenders album.

1037
01:22:38,085 --> 01:22:39,629
-That's mine.
-l bought it.

1038
01:22:39,837 --> 01:22:40,755
You did not!

1039
01:22:43,591 --> 01:22:45,885
You can have all the Billy Joels.

1040
01:22:47,595 --> 01:22:48,763
Except The Stranger.

1041
01:22:50,098 --> 01:22:51,975
l'm taking Thriller...

1042
01:22:52,267 --> 01:22:54,060
...and Mahler's Ninth.

1043
01:22:55,979 --> 01:22:58,022
Kevin is so fond of Mahler.

1044
01:22:59,774 --> 01:23:01,234
l moved in with Jules.

1045
01:23:01,526 --> 01:23:03,152
Oh, how nice.

1046
01:23:03,653 --> 01:23:05,113
Roomies again.

1047
01:23:08,616 --> 01:23:10,660
No Springsteen leaves this house!

1048
01:23:12,495 --> 01:23:14,956
You can have all the Carly Simons.

1049
01:23:15,206 --> 01:23:18,042
You got me those for Valentine's Day.
Remember Valentine's?

1050
01:23:18,751 --> 01:23:21,295
You ran out on this relationship.
Take the consequences.

1051
01:23:21,546 --> 01:23:23,756
l didn't run out on anything.
You ran out.

1052
01:23:24,006 --> 01:23:26,217
-You fucked Kevin!
-You fucked many!

1053
01:23:26,551 --> 01:23:28,177
Nameless, faceless many!

1054
01:23:30,513 --> 01:23:32,557
l feel much better now.

1055
01:23:32,807 --> 01:23:33,975
Thanks.

1056
01:23:44,152 --> 01:23:45,528
You're not taking The Police--

1057
01:23:46,070 --> 01:23:48,614
Anyway, l didn't just fuck Kevin!

1058
01:23:48,865 --> 01:23:52,035
l was confused and angry,
and l care about him deeply.

1059
01:23:52,327 --> 01:23:55,163
Get your clothes,
give me the keys and get out!

1060
01:23:57,290 --> 01:23:58,374
Now!

1061
01:24:02,837 --> 01:24:05,298
l can't believe
this is happening to us.

1062
01:24:13,681 --> 01:24:15,808
Wasted love!

1063
01:24:23,608 --> 01:24:25,985
God, l just wish
l could get it back!

1064
01:24:43,544 --> 01:24:44,378
You did it!

1065
01:24:46,881 --> 01:24:49,967
l think l'll probably
be back doing obits tomorrow.

1066
01:24:50,218 --> 01:24:53,137
You're gonna attract
a lot of attention with this.

1067
01:24:53,388 --> 01:24:54,222
You think?

1068
01:24:54,430 --> 01:24:56,057
lt's because of you.

1069
01:24:56,266 --> 01:24:58,309
l couldn't write anything till you.

1070
01:24:59,394 --> 01:25:00,228
What?

1071
01:25:02,730 --> 01:25:04,690
Don't you guys ever use a bed?

1072
01:25:06,567 --> 01:25:08,444
l'm gonna show Jules your piece.

1073
01:25:10,405 --> 01:25:11,781
Wait, wait, wait.

1074
01:25:12,073 --> 01:25:12,991
What?

1075
01:25:37,015 --> 01:25:38,641
Kevin has his first byline.

1076
01:25:38,892 --> 01:25:41,436
Really? That's great.
Let me see.

1077
01:25:45,898 --> 01:25:47,150
'' Housing in Maryland''?

1078
01:25:47,441 --> 01:25:49,819
-The other piece.
-''The Meaning of Life.''

1079
01:25:50,069 --> 01:25:53,990
Forrester's waiting. Did the hospital
call? Did my step-monster die?

1080
01:25:54,240 --> 01:25:56,367
-He's waiting.
-l want to meet him.

1081
01:25:56,659 --> 01:25:58,703
Not now, but l'll have him wave up.

1082
01:26:02,415 --> 01:26:05,918
-She's out of control.
-Since the day we met her.

1083
01:26:10,757 --> 01:26:11,591
Who is that?

1084
01:26:11,966 --> 01:26:14,010
Jules' boss and lover.

1085
01:26:19,682 --> 01:26:21,976
lnternational banking
has gotten sexier.

1086
01:26:22,268 --> 01:26:25,938
Speaking of which, not to get ahead
of myself, but l was thinking...

1087
01:26:26,230 --> 01:26:28,191
...maybe we'd get a place together.

1088
01:26:28,441 --> 01:26:29,275
What?

1089
01:26:29,525 --> 01:26:32,361
l know it's fast,
but l also know l love you.

1090
01:26:35,073 --> 01:26:36,783
Sex isn't love.

1091
01:26:43,289 --> 01:26:44,290
What's that mean?

1092
01:26:44,499 --> 01:26:48,502
That means that you were sitting there
with all these feelings...

1093
01:26:48,753 --> 01:26:53,299
...incredible feelings, tied up
in a box with my pictures.

1094
01:26:53,508 --> 01:26:56,177
And l needed to break away from Alec.

1095
01:27:09,315 --> 01:27:11,192
l'm not proud of my behaviour.

1096
01:27:14,112 --> 01:27:16,489
-Hang up.
-Who's that?

1097
01:27:17,031 --> 01:27:18,491
That's not Kevin, is it?

1098
01:27:19,617 --> 01:27:22,078
You're not with Kevin
playing my records?

1099
01:27:22,328 --> 01:27:23,246
Stop it, please.

1100
01:27:23,538 --> 01:27:26,791
-Tell him we're moving in together.
-We are not!

1101
01:27:27,333 --> 01:27:30,503
So the two of you are
moving in together.

1102
01:27:38,136 --> 01:27:41,806
l wish everything could be like
it was, all of us friends.

1103
01:27:42,473 --> 01:27:44,767
l don't want to be friends.

1104
01:27:47,145 --> 01:27:48,521
l didn't mean that.

1105
01:27:48,771 --> 01:27:50,314
l mean, it was an accident.

1106
01:27:51,065 --> 01:27:53,818
l'm beginning to think
there aren't any accidents.

1107
01:27:57,530 --> 01:28:00,283
And l would really like it...

1108
01:28:00,491 --> 01:28:02,535
...if you would just leave.

1109
01:28:03,369 --> 01:28:04,454
Okay?

1110
01:28:12,545 --> 01:28:13,546
Great.

1111
01:28:17,341 --> 01:28:18,968
You were right all along.

1112
01:28:19,218 --> 01:28:21,262
-Love sucks.
-Yep.

1113
01:28:23,640 --> 01:28:26,309
So you gonna get the old job back?

1114
01:28:26,559 --> 01:28:27,894
No way.

1115
01:28:28,853 --> 01:28:32,440
Once l'm back in school,
l'll work part-time for a law firm.

1116
01:28:32,690 --> 01:28:35,610
Did you know there are
as many students in law school...

1117
01:28:35,860 --> 01:28:37,236
...as there are lawyers?

1118
01:28:37,487 --> 01:28:38,821
Sounds familiar.

1119
01:28:46,704 --> 01:28:49,082
l always thought
we'd be friends forever.

1120
01:28:50,708 --> 01:28:55,338
Yeah, well, forever got a lot
shorter suddenly, didn't it?

1121
01:29:01,886 --> 01:29:04,806
Okay, call Mary Dusit at that number.

1122
01:29:05,348 --> 01:29:06,599
Yeah, l'll call.

1123
01:29:14,190 --> 01:29:15,566
l'll call you back.

1124
01:29:23,992 --> 01:29:26,119
l'm sorry to bother you here.

1125
01:29:26,369 --> 01:29:28,663
Did you forget one of your albums?

1126
01:29:28,913 --> 01:29:30,540
lt's Jules.

1127
01:29:31,458 --> 01:29:33,584
After she left for work
this morning...

1128
01:29:33,834 --> 01:29:36,671
...some finance company came
and took everything.

1129
01:29:36,921 --> 01:29:40,174
l couldn't reach her,
so l went over to her office.

1130
01:29:40,466 --> 01:29:42,677
She's been pretending
to go to work...

1131
01:29:42,927 --> 01:29:45,638
...telling me she's having
an affair with her boss.

1132
01:29:45,847 --> 01:29:48,141
He fired her three weeks ago.

1133
01:29:49,309 --> 01:29:51,352
l confronted her,
and she denied everything.

1134
01:29:51,603 --> 01:29:56,315
But then she went crazy. And now
she's locked herself in the apartment.

1135
01:29:59,444 --> 01:30:01,654
Please, l need your help.

1136
01:30:10,455 --> 01:30:12,415
Hi, Jules. Open the door.

1137
01:30:14,458 --> 01:30:16,335
-Open the door.
-She's in there.

1138
01:30:16,544 --> 01:30:18,254
She's got it deadbolted.

1139
01:30:25,094 --> 01:30:27,555
-What's he doing here?
-l called him.

1140
01:30:27,805 --> 01:30:29,849
Did you call all your lovers?

1141
01:30:30,099 --> 01:30:32,727
Will your high-school prom date
be joining us too?

1142
01:30:33,728 --> 01:30:36,647
-What's happening with Jules?
-She's bolted the door.

1143
01:30:37,064 --> 01:30:38,524
The fire escape!

1144
01:30:44,489 --> 01:30:45,490
Open up!

1145
01:30:56,792 --> 01:30:58,336
What are you doing?

1146
01:30:58,878 --> 01:31:01,005
-You'll freeze.
-That's the idea.

1147
01:31:01,255 --> 01:31:02,882
Jules, honey, it's me!

1148
01:31:03,883 --> 01:31:05,677
You're really scaring me now!

1149
01:31:05,885 --> 01:31:08,262
The country's falling apart,
but these bars are perfect.

1150
01:31:08,554 --> 01:31:11,266
-We need a hacksaw.
-Or an experienced thief.

1151
01:31:11,474 --> 01:31:12,559
l'll find Billy.

1152
01:31:12,851 --> 01:31:14,185
l was kidding.

1153
01:31:14,394 --> 01:31:17,563
He's working at the Amoco station.
l'll see what he's got.

1154
01:31:17,855 --> 01:31:20,316
-He's around the corner.
-Billy's working at a gas station?

1155
01:31:20,608 --> 01:31:22,068
He needed the money.

1156
01:31:24,570 --> 01:31:25,488
You little shit!

1157
01:31:32,036 --> 01:31:32,871
Here!

1158
01:31:33,454 --> 01:31:34,372
What's happening?

1159
01:31:34,622 --> 01:31:37,166
-How do you feel now, best friend?
-My notes!

1160
01:31:37,708 --> 01:31:40,002
You won't be needing
your notes anymore.

1161
01:31:40,586 --> 01:31:42,463
Stop it!
You'll kill him!

1162
01:31:42,755 --> 01:31:45,508
This won't solve anything.
Think of your career.

1163
01:31:45,800 --> 01:31:48,636
-Stop it!
-After all l've done for you!

1164
01:31:48,928 --> 01:31:51,139
l've done a lot for you too.
Pull me up.

1165
01:31:51,598 --> 01:31:53,057
What you did for me, you shit...

1166
01:31:53,808 --> 01:31:56,644
...was steal the woman
that l was gonna marry!

1167
01:32:00,106 --> 01:32:01,816
Kirbo, you need any help?

1168
01:32:02,066 --> 01:32:04,777
-Quick!
-Help! Alec, pull him up!

1169
01:32:06,446 --> 01:32:07,822
Looks pretty out of hand.

1170
01:32:08,072 --> 01:32:10,992
Stop it! Do you think this
is helping Jules?

1171
01:32:11,242 --> 01:32:12,243
l love her, man.

1172
01:32:13,202 --> 01:32:14,454
Give me a hand!

1173
01:32:16,873 --> 01:32:18,041
l got it! l got it!

1174
01:32:26,132 --> 01:32:27,842
-You all right?
-Super.

1175
01:32:28,051 --> 01:32:29,135
l'm going upstairs.

1176
01:32:29,552 --> 01:32:32,639
Somebody give me a hand!
Come on!

1177
01:32:32,889 --> 01:32:33,806
Oh, my God!

1178
01:32:34,557 --> 01:32:36,768
Honey, open the door.
lt's so cold.

1179
01:32:37,018 --> 01:32:39,062
Noble how you ran up
to save your lover.

1180
01:32:39,354 --> 01:32:40,897
He's not my lover.

1181
01:32:41,147 --> 01:32:43,107
-Jules, listen--
-Bullshit!

1182
01:32:43,357 --> 01:32:47,028
l've never lied to you since the day
l met you, you cocky shithead!

1183
01:32:48,029 --> 01:32:49,655
-Alec!
-We all love you.

1184
01:32:49,906 --> 01:32:50,990
Help!

1185
01:32:54,827 --> 01:32:56,287
Open this goddamn door!

1186
01:32:58,498 --> 01:33:00,041
-Blowtorch?
-Give it to me.

1187
01:33:00,250 --> 01:33:03,252
-Do not hand that man a blowtorch.
-Put these on.

1188
01:33:06,547 --> 01:33:07,298
Open the door!

1189
01:33:08,132 --> 01:33:11,552
Did you hear me?
Open the door, or l'll bust it down!

1190
01:33:15,473 --> 01:33:17,100
l'm coming through this door!

1191
01:33:17,350 --> 01:33:19,978
You know l'm crazy enough to do it!

1192
01:33:22,063 --> 01:33:22,897
What's happening?

1193
01:33:34,284 --> 01:33:35,451
l'm going in.

1194
01:33:40,540 --> 01:33:41,374
Hi, Billy.

1195
01:33:51,551 --> 01:33:53,761
What's the big deal here?

1196
01:33:53,970 --> 01:33:55,430
You lost a job?

1197
01:33:55,722 --> 01:33:59,142
l've lost 20 of them since graduation.

1198
01:33:59,767 --> 01:34:01,394
Plus a wife and kid.

1199
01:34:02,061 --> 01:34:06,065
ln a new development, a handful
of hair in the shower this morning.

1200
01:34:06,899 --> 01:34:08,359
That's better.

1201
01:34:09,193 --> 01:34:10,194
You know...

1202
01:34:11,028 --> 01:34:14,782
...this smells to me like
a little bit of self-created drama.

1203
01:34:15,199 --> 01:34:18,369
l should know. l've been
starring in a few of my own.

1204
01:34:20,455 --> 01:34:24,208
Do you know what l've been doing
every day since l got fired?

1205
01:34:25,084 --> 01:34:26,002
What?

1206
01:34:26,252 --> 01:34:29,922
l've been sitting in the hospital
with my step-monster.

1207
01:34:32,425 --> 01:34:35,678
We've had the best talks
we've ever had.

1208
01:34:37,138 --> 01:34:41,267
Of course, she's in a coma,
which really pisses me off.

1209
01:34:43,144 --> 01:34:45,354
Because all that time...

1210
01:34:47,648 --> 01:34:49,108
...l just waited...

1211
01:34:49,400 --> 01:34:52,737
...for one word from that woman...

1212
01:34:54,489 --> 01:34:58,701
...about why my father
hates me so much.

1213
01:35:12,673 --> 01:35:14,467
Jules, you know...

1214
01:35:15,968 --> 01:35:17,595
...honey, this isn't real.

1215
01:35:18,054 --> 01:35:19,430
You know what it is?

1216
01:35:19,681 --> 01:35:21,057
lt's St. Elmo's fire.

1217
01:35:21,432 --> 01:35:25,478
The electric flashes of light that
appear in dark skies out of nowhere.

1218
01:35:31,317 --> 01:35:35,238
Sailors would guide entire journeys
by it. But there was no fire.

1219
01:35:35,488 --> 01:35:38,324
There wasn't even a St. Elmo.
They made it up...

1220
01:35:39,284 --> 01:35:43,288
...because they needed it
to keep going when things got tough.

1221
01:35:43,538 --> 01:35:45,915
Just like you're making up
all of this.

1222
01:35:50,336 --> 01:35:52,380
We're all going through this.

1223
01:35:55,007 --> 01:35:57,218
lt's our time on the edge.

1224
01:35:59,554 --> 01:36:02,223
l'm just so tired.

1225
01:36:04,684 --> 01:36:08,688
l never thought l'd be so tired at 22.

1226
01:36:13,067 --> 01:36:16,154
l just don't even know
who to be anymore.

1227
01:36:16,446 --> 01:36:18,072
Join the club.

1228
01:36:22,535 --> 01:36:26,998
No one was buying this together-
woman-of-the-eighties stuff anyway.

1229
01:36:35,256 --> 01:36:39,719
And all this time l was afraid
you'd find out l wasn't fabulous.

1230
01:36:42,055 --> 01:36:43,514
lt's cool.

1231
01:36:44,974 --> 01:36:48,728
All this time l was afraid
you'd find out l was irresponsible.

1232
01:36:54,609 --> 01:36:55,860
They're laughing.

1233
01:36:56,068 --> 01:36:57,945
The hysterical laughter heard...

1234
01:36:58,196 --> 01:37:00,823
...most frequently
from schizophrenic paranoids.

1235
01:37:01,324 --> 01:37:04,661
Set up my drafting table
so we can have coffee on it.

1236
01:37:08,414 --> 01:37:10,375
-Oh, baby.
-l love you.

1237
01:37:16,964 --> 01:37:18,758
And then what happened?

1238
01:37:18,966 --> 01:37:20,051
That was it.

1239
01:37:20,301 --> 01:37:24,347
We came out of the bedroom,
and then l shot her.

1240
01:37:24,889 --> 01:37:26,849
No, you did not.

1241
01:37:27,141 --> 01:37:28,601
You saved her life.

1242
01:37:28,852 --> 01:37:31,145
Oh, let's not be dramatic.

1243
01:37:32,104 --> 01:37:34,565
So when did you get so sane?

1244
01:37:35,107 --> 01:37:38,528
When l realized how insane l'd been
trying to be like Alec.

1245
01:37:39,195 --> 01:37:41,656
l'm not part of this
after-college life.

1246
01:37:41,948 --> 01:37:43,908
Careers. Marriage.

1247
01:37:45,285 --> 01:37:47,328
Felicia and Melody'll be
better off without me.

1248
01:37:47,579 --> 01:37:49,873
Did she get remarried already?

1249
01:37:50,748 --> 01:37:52,458
ln about three or four weeks.

1250
01:37:56,087 --> 01:37:58,381
l was thinking of hanging
around and being...

1251
01:37:58,631 --> 01:38:01,092
...one of those
l'll-see-you-on-the-weekend dads.

1252
01:38:01,384 --> 01:38:03,344
That's not what Melody needs.

1253
01:38:04,095 --> 01:38:06,389
Besides, it'd confuse everybody.

1254
01:38:11,811 --> 01:38:13,145
You don't have to.

1255
01:38:13,354 --> 01:38:15,898
Come on, it's not even half of
what l owe you.

1256
01:38:17,233 --> 01:38:19,694
l'll get you the rest
once l get settled in New York.

1257
01:38:19,944 --> 01:38:24,157
lf l can find someone who's
fool enough to let me play my sax.

1258
01:38:24,407 --> 01:38:26,534
Oh, they'll let you play.
You're really--

1259
01:38:26,826 --> 01:38:27,744
Talented, Billy.

1260
01:38:29,120 --> 01:38:30,580
You are.

1261
01:38:38,296 --> 01:38:40,089
This place is great.

1262
01:38:46,429 --> 01:38:48,389
You wanna know what's great?

1263
01:38:49,265 --> 01:38:51,142
Last night, l woke up...

1264
01:38:51,351 --> 01:38:54,437
...to make myself a peanut
butter and jelly sandwich.

1265
01:38:56,188 --> 01:39:00,985
And you know, it was my kitchen,
and it was my refrigerator...

1266
01:39:01,444 --> 01:39:03,321
...and it was my apartment...

1267
01:39:03,613 --> 01:39:06,366
...and it was the best peanut butter
and jelly sandwich...

1268
01:39:06,616 --> 01:39:08,576
...l've had in my entire life.

1269
01:39:32,725 --> 01:39:34,269
You're really going, huh?

1270
01:39:40,441 --> 01:39:41,609
You still a virgin?

1271
01:39:44,529 --> 01:39:48,282
Why is my sexual status
so important to you?

1272
01:40:12,307 --> 01:40:17,020
Have l abused our relationship
too much...

1273
01:40:19,313 --> 01:40:23,067
...or could l be so bold as to ask you
for a going-away present?

1274
01:40:49,427 --> 01:40:50,678
Oh, God.

1275
01:41:27,298 --> 01:41:28,299
Good luck.

1276
01:41:34,847 --> 01:41:36,474
You're gonna be okay.

1277
01:41:36,975 --> 01:41:38,601
So are you.

1278
01:41:45,107 --> 01:41:47,568
Forgive me for not getting intimate.

1279
01:41:48,027 --> 01:41:49,654
Here. Long ride.

1280
01:41:50,947 --> 01:41:52,991
-You shouldn't have.
-l know.

1281
01:41:55,577 --> 01:41:57,954
You're beautiful. Never shave.

1282
01:41:58,162 --> 01:42:00,707
Don't go changing to please me.

1283
01:42:05,753 --> 01:42:06,754
Bye.

1284
01:42:07,547 --> 01:42:09,257
Don't let her go.

1285
01:42:16,306 --> 01:42:18,099
Go get out of hand.

1286
01:42:18,308 --> 01:42:19,934
l'm gonna keep in touch.

1287
01:42:20,185 --> 01:42:21,728
No, you will not.

1288
01:42:58,014 --> 01:43:01,017
l can't remember
who met who first...

1289
01:43:01,392 --> 01:43:04,104
... or who fell in love
with who first.

1290
01:43:04,520 --> 01:43:09,150
All l can remember is
the seven of us always together.

1291
01:43:09,400 --> 01:43:11,611
And l've made a decision.

1292
01:43:13,654 --> 01:43:14,906
l think...

1293
01:43:15,239 --> 01:43:18,076
...l have to be
by myself for a while.

1294
01:43:20,578 --> 01:43:23,039
l thought l was
the miracle of your life.

1295
01:43:24,415 --> 01:43:26,042
l thought l was the miracle.

1296
01:43:26,292 --> 01:43:28,252
l love you both.

1297
01:43:29,128 --> 01:43:32,882
l'm gonna try life
without any miracles for a while.

1298
01:43:35,176 --> 01:43:37,470
l hope we can still be friends.

1299
01:43:42,141 --> 01:43:43,518
-Sure.
-Sure.

1300
01:43:44,227 --> 01:43:45,770
Let's kill her.

1301
01:43:56,531 --> 01:43:58,992
Do you want to go in
and get a drink?

1302
01:43:59,242 --> 01:44:01,911
-l gotta be at work early tomorrow.
-Me too.

1303
01:44:03,496 --> 01:44:06,332
-l need to find a job tomorrow.
-Me too.

1304
01:44:06,583 --> 01:44:07,959
How about brunch Sunday?

1305
01:44:08,209 --> 01:44:12,046
That sounds good.
So we meet here around 1 2:30?

1306
01:44:13,131 --> 01:44:15,174
Why don't we go to Hoolihan's?

1307
01:44:16,342 --> 01:44:17,176
Not so noisy.

1308
01:44:18,011 --> 01:44:19,971
Not so many kids.

1309
01:44:22,974 --> 01:44:24,601
-Great.
-Sunday, 1 2:30.

1310
01:44:27,770 --> 01:44:30,523
Guess what?
You guys will never believe it.

1311
01:44:30,731 --> 01:44:35,027
l found out that it only costs
$250 to bury a cat.

1312
01:44:35,236 --> 01:44:40,199
So l figured, why don't l just put
my step-monster into a large cat suit?
