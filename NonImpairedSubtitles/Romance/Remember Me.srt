TYLER: Well, at least
it's a young James Whistler,

38
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:12,181
because, God, l mean, Whistler,
he fell off in the latter half of his career.

by a group.

personal character is more important?

00:43:53,548 --> 00:43:54,840
{SlGHS}

626
00:44:00,138 --> 00:44:01,763
He killed himself.

627
00:44:08,021 --> 00:44:09,104
When?

628
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:14,693
On his 22nd birthday.

629
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:19,406
He'd just started working for my father.

630
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:23,744
l thought he was a musician.

631
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:27,414
Yeah, he was.

632
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:34,963
But he wasn't making any money. And

633
00:44:37,425 --> 00:44:39,843
my dad's a pretty compelling guy.

634
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:44,806
Yeah. So is mine.

635
00:44:47,602 --> 00:44:48,894
{Exclaiming}

00:44:48,978 --> 00:44:52,064
-{in lRlSH ACCENT} Damn, you're not naked!
-You're not lrish.

637
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:54,983
What the hell happened in the kitchen?

638
00:44:55,068 --> 00:44:58,570
it looks like somebody's water broke
in there. it’s gross.

639
00:44:59,906 --> 00:45:02,783
-Hi.
-ALLY: Hi.

640
00:45:02,909 --> 00:45:05,035

641
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:08,997
-Ally, Ally...
-Ally, Aidan. This is my roommate.

642
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:12,334

Wait. What?

646
00:45:19,342 --> 00:45:20,467
{ALLY Laughing}

647
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:23,970
Okay, "Around The World" party, third floor.
Come on, let's go.

648
00:45:24,055 --> 00:45:27,265
There's a whole lot of ugly,
but there's a lot more alcohol, so...

649
00:45:27,350 --> 00:45:29,184
Come on, let's go.

650
00:45:29,268 --> 00:45:31,019
Yeah, l would, l'd love to,
but l should get home.

651
00:45:31,104 --> 00:45:34,648
What? No, no, no.
All right, listen, listen, listen.

652
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:36,316
Ally? Ally, Ally?

653
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:38,360
One drink.

654
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:42,114
Any country you want.
l'll even put France on the table.

655
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:45,158
Come on. And then we'll go.

656
00:45:45,701 --> 00:45:47,119
One drink?

657
00:45:50,206 --> 00:45:53,291
-One drink?
-One drink.

658
00:45:55,169 --> 00:45:56,461
{Retching}

659
00:46:01,676 --> 00:46:03,093
How are we doing?

660
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:05,679
What?

661
00:46:06,722 --> 00:46:09,683
What? What do you want me to say?
You want me to say l'm sorry?

662
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:13,645
You want me to apologize
for showing a nice girl a good time?

663
00:46:17,984 --> 00:46:20,360
-l'm sorry.
-ALLY: Tyler,

664
00:46:22,488 --> 00:46:25,198
l need you to call my dad.

665
00:46:29,996 --> 00:46:33,123
Yeah, sure. Where's your phone?

666
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:34,332
{Coughing}

667
00:46:39,881 --> 00:46:41,840
Ally, your phone's dead.

668
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:45,969
Ally?

669
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:48,430
What's his number?

670
00:46:50,725 --> 00:46:51,808
{SlGHS}

671
00:46:51,893 --> 00:46:53,393
God damn.

672
00:46:56,814 --> 00:46:59,316
Nell: Do you think l give a shit how late it is?

673
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:04,237
l know she's a smart girl, Leo.
She's supposed to be back. She's not back.

674
00:47:07,033 --> 00:47:09,409
Leo, don't go there. All right?

675
00:47:10,286 --> 00:47:13,747

676
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:18,084
Yeah. And call me back.

677
00:47:19,921 --> 00:47:21,546
God damn it, just do it!

678
00:48:05,174 --> 00:48:06,967
Oh, shit.

679
00:48:07,176 --> 00:48:08,176
Shit!

680
00:48:17,687 --> 00:48:18,687
{GROANS}

681
00:48:42,503 --> 00:48:44,671
l'm sorry. l fell asleep.

682
00:48:47,008 --> 00:48:48,842
Asleep where?

683
00:48:50,052 --> 00:48:51,886
My phone died, so...

684
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:57,976
-That's mine. That's from my desk.
-l was trying to find some information.

685
00:48:58,269 --> 00:49:00,270
What am l now, one of your suspects?

686
00:49:00,354 --> 00:49:03,064
When you act like one.
Are you on anything?

687
00:49:03,149 --> 00:49:06,151
-Oh, for God's sake.
-Don't use that tone with me, Ally.

688
00:49:07,194 --> 00:49:09,029
l smell alcohol.

689
00:49:09,739 --> 00:49:11,239
Yeah, so do l.

690
00:49:13,159 --> 00:49:16,578
What's going on here, Ally? Are you trying
to tell me something with this?

691
00:49:16,662 --> 00:49:18,371
You're all grown up now?

692
00:49:18,581 --> 00:49:22,709
Yeah, maybe it's time you get used to it,
Dad, before you give yourself a heart attack.

693
00:49:23,294 --> 00:49:24,294
Who's the guy?

694
00:49:24,378 --> 00:49:27,881
-God, what makes you think there's a guy?
-Yeah, he's a real prince.

695
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:31,384
He gets you drunk,
sends you home smelling like a brewery,

696
00:49:31,469 --> 00:49:33,595
smelling like God knows what.

697
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:38,558
-You sure can pick them.
-Yeah, l take after my mother.

698
00:49:43,439 --> 00:49:47,400
-l'm not a child, okay?
-Hey! in this house, you are!

699
00:49:48,194 --> 00:49:49,402
You'd love that!

700
00:49:49,487 --> 00:49:52,030
You're pathetic! Would you strangle me
'cause you couldn't save Mom...

701
00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:57,911
Ally? Ally?

702
00:49:58,746 --> 00:50:00,038
{Panting}

703
00:50:00,122 --> 00:50:02,082
Don't touch me! Don't...

704
00:50:06,921 --> 00:50:08,088
{ALLY Crying}

705
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:19,474
So, what? She just left? No goodbye?

706
00:50:21,394 --> 00:50:23,770
You were the one dumping
Jell-O shots down her throat.

707
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:27,440
Hey, there are sins of omission
and sins of commission.

708
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:31,111
l've forgiven myself, okay?
You should do the same.

709
00:50:31,779 --> 00:50:33,446
All right, here we go.

710
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:36,116
Come on! {Grunting} Come on!

711
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:40,120
Here we go! Here we go!

712
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:45,500
Got it! Okay!

Okay... Don't think l can...

it’s crushing! l need a little help here! Tyler!

716
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:56,761
-What the hell, man?
-it’s penance.

717
00:50:57,471 --> 00:50:58,805
l'm going to work.

718
00:51:00,391 --> 00:51:01,599
Help!

719
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:03,935
TYLER: Well, if you had another one
of those protein shakes...

720
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:07,313
Yeah, but it was freaking
crushing my sternum, you jackass.

721
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:14,279
Hey.

00:51:21,162 --> 00:51:22,662
How's she doing?

724
00:51:25,541 --> 00:51:27,333
She's pretty shaken up.

725
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:33,339
We need to fix that deadbolt.

726
00:51:34,258 --> 00:51:36,676
Yeah. That's my bad.

727
00:51:36,886 --> 00:51:40,013
Don't worry about it.
Do you think she's goanna sleep?

728
00:51:45,853 --> 00:51:48,271
You know, you realize
if she'd had the S.L.U.T...

729
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:52,776
ls it too soon?

-Can l get you anything?
-No.

Thanks, honey. See you later.

l can't believe you still come down here.

00:56:21,754 --> 00:56:24,380
l can't believe he still drinks that stuff.

740
00:56:24,465 --> 00:56:27,633
Well, you know how it goes.
You can take the kid out of Brooklyn...

741
00:56:28,719 --> 00:56:31,763
You're not writing anything bad about me,
are you?

742
00:56:31,972 --> 00:56:33,389
Not today.

743
00:56:34,850 --> 00:56:37,143

752
00:57:10,677 --> 00:57:14,430
-Why?
-l went to a coffee shop.

753
00:57:16,016 --> 00:57:17,683

754
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:22,480
Thanks. Yeah.

755
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:26,192
You realize New York's
full of coffee shops?

756
00:57:27,653 --> 00:57:30,196
Yeah, it was me and Michael's place.

757
00:57:31,532 --> 00:57:34,617
We used to go there for breakfast
all the time.

758
00:57:35,369 --> 00:57:38,704
l mean, probably not as many times
as l think we did,

759
00:57:41,250 --> 00:57:42,667
but enough.

760
00:57:45,712 --> 00:57:48,339
We went there on the morning that...

761
00:57:50,217 --> 00:57:52,593
it was the last place l saw him.

762
00:57:53,804 --> 00:57:55,555
You go there to write to him?

763
00:57:58,517 --> 00:58:01,227
l just wanted to tell someone about you.

764
00:58:10,237 --> 00:58:12,697
My mom was murdered 1 0 years ago.

765
00:58:13,824 --> 00:58:17,243
You don't have to say anything.
You're sorry. l know.

766
00:58:18,871 --> 00:58:21,497
And my dad...

767
00:58:23,083 --> 00:58:26,878
My dad's the kind of guy
who needs to take care of people.

768
00:58:26,962 --> 00:58:29,714
l know that sounds kind of weird right now,

769
00:58:31,550 --> 00:58:33,259
but he's not that guy.

770
00:58:34,261 --> 00:58:37,597
You know, l trust him. l really do.

771
00:58:39,266 --> 00:58:41,017
And l just don't want you to think
that l'm here

772
00:58:41,101 --> 00:58:44,061
'cause he's some crazy, belligerent person.

773
00:58:45,981 --> 00:58:50,610
He just doesn't understand, or...

774
00:58:52,779 --> 00:58:57,241
l don't know, just doesn't know
what's going on right now.

775
00:59:03,832 --> 00:59:05,917
What's going on right now?

776
00:59:11,215 --> 00:59:12,715
l don't know.

777
00:59:23,268 --> 00:59:26,187
-Did you call dispatch to check?
-l...

778
00:59:26,271 --> 00:59:28,397
You're goanna have to testify to this!

And they're goanna ask you,
"Are you sure of the time?"

780

01:10:40,111 --> 01:10:41,361
TYLER: Ally.

942
01:10:49,412 --> 01:10:52,164
God, Tyler? Can we at least talk about this?

943
01:10:53,249 --> 01:10:55,292
Where are you going to go right now?
And what are you goanna do

944
01:10:55,376 --> 01:10:58,670
that's actually goanna help anything?
Do you really think...

945
01:10:59,672 --> 01:11:01,882
You better look after yourself for an hour.

946
01:11:02,675 --> 01:11:04,968
Are you capable of doing that?

947
01:11:23,446 --> 01:11:27,616
Are you guys telling me you get the call
at 6:00, and l don't get it till 8:00 tonight?

948
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:30,535
Now, l don't know what's going on,
but someone's dropped the ball here...

949
01:11:30,620 --> 01:11:32,746
-Tyler!
-Mr. Hawkins!

950
01:11:33,081 --> 01:11:34,665
it’s fine, Janine. it’s fine.

951
01:11:34,749 --> 01:11:38,043
She drew you a picture. She drew you
a picture, and you didn't come.

952
01:11:41,047 --> 01:11:42,798
Put it on the table.

953
01:11:43,925 --> 01:11:49,596
You have a daughter who sincerely believes
that you don't like her.

954
01:11:51,391 --> 01:11:54,726
l mean, she's trying to communicate.
She's speaking.

955
01:11:55,019 --> 01:11:59,773
But why aren't you listening?
l mean, why aren't you

956
01:12:01,150 --> 01:12:02,401
riveted?

957
01:12:03,111 --> 01:12:07,447
Why is this not the most important thing,
just for one night?

958
01:12:08,408 --> 01:12:09,408
Janine: {SOFTLY} Tyler.

959
01:12:09,534 --> 01:12:13,036
-We can come back.
-No, it's fine. Sit down. Sit down. it’s okay.

960
01:12:18,584 --> 01:12:20,460
Who's this display for?

961
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:23,839
it’s for you.

962
01:12:25,758 --> 01:12:28,176
She knows l'll take care of her.

963
01:12:28,261 --> 01:12:29,344
And?

964
01:12:30,138 --> 01:12:34,057
-MAN: We really can come back another...
-Sit the fuck down! Now!

965
01:12:37,270 --> 01:12:39,980
And that l love her. l love her.

966
01:12:41,858 --> 01:12:46,528
Good God, you toss that word around,
but you have no idea what it means!

967
01:12:46,612 --> 01:12:48,113
Maybe l don't.

968
01:12:48,781 --> 01:12:52,951
-And maybe Caroline doesn't, either.
-l have provided her world, and yours.

969
01:12:53,036 --> 01:12:56,413
That doesn't mean you can just shatter it
whenever you feel,

970
01:12:56,497 --> 01:12:58,540
{Stammering}
whenever there's something better to do!

971
01:12:58,624 --> 01:13:00,042
Who the hell do you think
you're talking to?

972
01:13:00,126 --> 01:13:02,419
You pedalled down here on your bike,
for Christ's sake!

973
01:13:02,503 --> 01:13:07,257
You got to take care of nothing!
You're responsible for no one! You're a kid!

974
01:13:07,341 --> 01:13:10,302
You think you're the first one
to lose anything?

975
01:13:10,386 --> 01:13:15,557
You think that whatever you feel
in your heart, l don't also feel it in mine?

976
01:13:19,353 --> 01:13:21,146
You didn't find him.

977
01:13:21,606 --> 01:13:23,231
See, l found him.

978
01:13:25,318 --> 01:13:29,362
And you're so just tragically blind

979
01:13:30,531 --> 01:13:34,826
that the rest of your children
are goanna hang themselves on your watch.

980
01:13:34,911 --> 01:13:37,454
You little piece of... Come over here,
l'm goanna smack you.

981

l could handle that for, like, a summer.

1011

And then Aidan saw you guys at school,

1070
01:22:59,224 --> 01:23:01,476
so he suggested that

1071

l introduce myself to you.

You set it up that way.

it’s not a big deal.

She'll be back.

1084
