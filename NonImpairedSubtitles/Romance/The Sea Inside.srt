1
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,800
Easy.

2
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,480
Diazepam, five milligrams.

3
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,120
Easy now, Mr. Cable,
you're gonna be fine.

4
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,000
Just having a nightmare.
Let it go Mr. Cable.

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,200
Whatever it is,
you have to let it go.

6
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,320
Where am I?

7
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,120
You're in a hospital.
Saint Jude's.

8
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm doctor Jeremy Newman.

9
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,200
I've been assigned
your case.

10
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,680
You were admitted
last night.

11
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,000
Don't you remember?

12
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:06,400
That's okay.

13
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:09,120
Perfectly normal after
that kind of trauma.

14
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,320
What happened?

15
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,080
Paramedics were called
just after midnight.

16
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,800
They found you, right
in front of your house.

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,880
You had violent choleric
abdominal convulsions.

18
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:24,200
I'm afraid we had to evacuate
your stomach contents.

19
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,600
And?

20
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:33,200
It's just, uh...
I apologize...

21
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,200
I've never had to tell
a patient this before.

22
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,000
We're a small hospital
and painfully short-staffed.

23
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm actually a pediatric
doctor by training so

24
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,880
any bad news
I have to give

25
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,800
usually involves a lollipop.

26
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,880
Would you like one?

27
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,000
It's grape.

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,480
Doctor, please.

29
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,880
You died, Mr. Cable.

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Your heart stopped beating
for nearly two minutes.

31
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,200
No, no, it's alright.

32
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,320
We resuscitated you.
We brought you back.

33
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,680
You're good as new
well, practically.

34
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,120
So, that's why I'm here.

35
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,000
Now, over the next
few days, we'll...

36
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,720
run a series of tests to...

37
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,880
My name is Simon Cable.

38
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I was born on
July 4th, 1974.

39
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,680
My parents were
Catherine and Leonard.

40
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,200
My father owned
a publishing company.

41
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,120
My mother ran charities.

42
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,400
I have one older brother
Peter.

43
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,480
You can ask me anything
I'm...

44
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,120
fine.

45
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,600
That's the spirit.
This won't take long.

46
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,480
Okay, so

47
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,400
do you remember my name?

48
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,800
Dr. Newman... Justin.

49
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:07,000
Jeremy, that's okay, nobody
around here remembers it anyway.

50
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,320
Um, and the date?

51
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,400
It's the...

52
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,400
Uh, have I missed a day?

53
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,720
No, it's friday.

54
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,120
Then it's uh...

55
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,520
God, I've always been
terrible with dates.

56
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,400
Well, that, that's okay
don't worry about it.

57
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:42,600
Um, how about the month?

58
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,880
What month do you
think it is?

59
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:53,680
It's uh, summer, maybe?

60
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,880
How about the year?

61
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,120
Well, last year was 1999.

62
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,080
So, this year is 2000.

63
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:16,200
It's the year 2000, right?

64
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,000
Uh, your wife's name?

65
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:33,280
Simon, this is the
29th of July.

66
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,000
The year is 2002.

67
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,800
And your wife
whose name is Anna

68
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,720
is waiting outside.

69
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,120
Back that truck out now!

70
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,080
Get these cars out of here!

71
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,520
We're gonna to need
some backup here!

72
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,200
Hey, come out here.

73
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,320
Are you alright?
You okay?

74
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,120
Take it easy man, I'm going to
take you on a little trip.

75
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,520
You okay? Just hang in there now.

76
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,720
Won't be long.

77
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,080
- What have we got?
- We got trauma...

78
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,320
Let's move on.
Saline, stabilize the heart.

79
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,200
Watch your backs.

80
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,080
Make it jolly.

81
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,320
Help me move.

82
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,880
Make that bolder.

83
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,200
His name is Simon Cable.

84
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,400
One, two, three.

85
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,280
Time is twenty hundred hours.

86
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,400
He's crashed, he's crashed!
Get the defrib!

87
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,200
Start chest compression.

88
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,800
One, two, three, four, five.

89
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,200
One, two, three, four, five.

90
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:22,480
One, two, three, four, five.

91
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:27,520
One, two, three, four, five.

92
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,680
One, two, three, four, five.

93
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,800
One, two, three, four, five.

94
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,000
No pulse.
Been flat.

95
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,600
Get someone from
surgery down here, pedals.

96
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,920
One hundred.

97
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,280
Charging!

98
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,520
Clear! No change.

99
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,200
Two hundred.

100
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,200
Charging! Clear!

101
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,800
There's nothing to explain
Dr. Newman.

102
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:11,000
His synoptic cholinesterase
is practically non-existent.

103
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,280
I really don't wanna be
discussing this right now.

104
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,720
What I need is coffee.

105
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,320
Poisonings have
suspicious need.

106
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,920
You have to come report it
to the police.

107
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,920
That's hospital policy.

108
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:23,800
Let's rule everything out first,
that's all I'm saying.

109
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,880
Diazepam, five milligrams.

110
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,080
Take it easy, Mr. Cable.
You're gonna be fine.

111
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,320
Just having a nightmare.

112
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,520
Let it go Mr. Cable.

113
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,000
Whatever it is
you just have to let it go.

114
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:42,320
So what we're looking at here
is anterior grade amnesia.

115
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,800
Basically short term
memory loss.

116
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,600
Nothing to get
too worried about.

117
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,480
Nothing to get
too worried about?

118
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,600
These episodes usually
sort themselves out

119
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,400
in a couple of days
a couple of weeks.

120
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,680
You're telling me that
I've lost two years of my life?

121
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,400
Think of it as if
your life's a puzzle

122
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,000
that's been jumbled up.

123
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,080
All the pieces are
still there

124
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,600
we just have to put them
back together.

125
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:08,000
Fit them in the right
order and place

126
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,280
and, honestly, Simon
I love a good puzzle.

127
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,280
And I have a wife?

128
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,400
Yeah, these situations are
tough on couples

129
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,680
but your wife will
help us with this.

130
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,600
She could be the key.

131
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,400
So, if you're
feeling up to it

132
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,920
I'll go and get her.

133
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,800
What do you think, Simon?

134
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,600
Would you like me
to get your wife?

135
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,280
Simon?

136
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:18,080
God! Simon.
I was so scared.

137
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,800
I called every hospital.
I didn't sleep at all.

138
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,080
Give me a break now.

139
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,200
The doctor says
i'll be just fine.

140
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,400
Oh, my god
what happened to you?

141
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,400
You have no idea
how scared I was.

142
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,400
For a moment lactually felt
what it would be like

143
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,720
if you weren't in my life.
I just completely lost it.

144
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,600
You know
it was kind of pathetic.

145
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,600
What's the matter?
Are you hurting?

146
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,320
Dr. Newman hasn't told you
what's happened to me, has he?

147
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,200
Now you're
freaking me out, sir.

148
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,080
I've lost my memory.

149
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,800
I can't remember anything
about the past two years.

150
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,520
I don't even know
how I got here last night

151
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,720
and I don't know
who you are.

152
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,720
What are you doing, Simon?

153
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,720
Telling you the truth.

154
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,400
I'm sorry.

155
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,000
I don't know you, at all.

156
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,600
You're serious?

157
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,600
With everything
that's happened

158
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,720
this is how you're
going to tell me?

159
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,600
Wait a second.
I don't think you understand.

160
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,680
- Are you crazy, Simon?
- I don't know what happened.

161
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,080
I have nothing left.

162
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,320
Wait! Please!

163
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,520
Anna!

164
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,280
Anna!

165
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,280
Whoa, Mr. Cable. Whoa, stop.

166
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,000
Stop her!

167
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,280
- Stop who?
- My wife!

168
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,600
- There's no one here
- What are you talking about?

169
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,880
No aerobics for at least
a week, Simon.

170
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,200
Dr. Newman, will you please
stop my wife?

171
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,400
Stop her?
She's not going anywhere.

172
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,200
You have to tell her
what's happened to me.

173
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,320
- I have, Simon
- No, you haven't!

174
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,000
Yes, he has, Simon.

175
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,200
Thank god, you're okay.

176
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:38,000
The kids I work with can't
get enough of these things.

177
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,400
I love watching their
eyes light up

178
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,200
when they finally
put it all together.

179
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,320
It's just amazing.

180
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,200
Anyway, in order to recover
what you've lost, Simon

181
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,600
we need to find
two points in time

182
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,400
and join them.

183
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,200
So, let's begin with the last memory
you can recall two years ago.

184
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:13,680
Can you tell us
what happened last night?

185
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,400
I wasn't with you
last night.

186
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,200
He has no memory
of any of it.

187
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:20,800
Your role, Anna
will be to help him

188
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,400
put his life back together.

189
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,920
Our life.

190
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,800
- It was our life.
- Of course.

191
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,280
Last night I was at home.

192
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,080
You were up here.
I don't know what happened.

193
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,320
Peter.

194
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,280
- I must have been visiting Peter.
- Peter?

195
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:46,000
Peter is my brother.
He lives up here.

196
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,800
He moved into our parent's
estate after my mom died.

197
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,800
We don't really
get along, but...

198
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,880
That's the only reason
I'd be up here, right?

199
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:05,120
Simon, honey.
Peter's dead.

200
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,320
What?

201
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,880
Peter died before we met.

202
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,400
There's no fucking way.

203
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:20,080
I was going to see him
just last night.

204
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,080
You didn't see
Peter last night.

205
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,200
He means his last night
the last night he can remember.

206
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,880
There was rain

207
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,000
and this light.

208
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,320
Then everything's quiet.

209
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:53,400
No rain.
No light, just...

210
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:56,320
Oh, gosh, he's talking
about the car accident.

211
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:02,000
Just this empty void

212
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,920
and I'm lost in it.

213
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,680
It happened right
before we met, Simon.

214
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,800
I don't know that much,

215
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,000
Just that you were up
here to see Peter.

216
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,800
I don't even know why

217
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,920
you never used to like
to talk about your brother.

218
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,600
There was a fight over
their father's estate.

219
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,280
Maybe you read about it.

220
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,800
Anyway after the accident

221
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,800
this is the hospital you were
taken to, I know that much.

222
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,200
Wait a minute.
I was here before?

223
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,920
I really need a cigarette.

224
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,920
So, we have our two moments
Simon.

225
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,880
Both were accidents.
Both led you to St Jude's.

226
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,320
I can't remember.

227
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
It doesn't make sense.

228
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,480
None of this makes
any fucking sense.

229
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,480
Two days ago
you came up here

230
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,320
to close up your
parents' house.

231
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,800
It's been sitting here
for two years, ever since...

232
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,600
Anyway, you finally
agreed to let it go.

233
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,720
You were going
to pack up the furniture

234
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,880
fix some of the fixtures
finish the old staircase and

235
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,080
refinish?

236
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,200
Interesting.

237
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,480
Not really, it's a gorgeous place
but it's falling apart.

238
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,400
No, no, what I mean is.

239
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:26,600
Well, one or two of Simon's
enzyme counts are lower than normal.

240
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,400
But I thought you said
I was okay.

241
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,680
I said practically, kid.

242
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,680
But your lower enzymes
are an indication

243
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,880
that somehow your
bloodstream was poisoned.

244
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,880
Are you saying someone
tried to poison him?

245
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,800
I'm not trying
to say anything.

246
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,920
But it's highly possible

247
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,480
that your condition was
caused by fumes

248
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,120
from certain cleaning
solutions or varnishes

249
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,280
trapped in an enclosed space.

250
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,920
- So now what?
- Well, you'll be fine.

251
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,280
We've got you an Atropane.

252
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,280
We'll reactivate your
Cholinesterase

253
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,280
with one of the Doximes.

254
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,200
The sooner you can eat
something, the better.

255
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,680
I've scheduled an M.R.I.

256
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,800
To make sure that
everything is a okay.

257
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,400
So, if you'll excuse me.

258
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,400
I'm sure you've seen enough
of me to last you a lifetime.

259
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,120
I'll check back in
with you in a few...

260
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,520
Anna?

261
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,000
You can drop the pretense now
you smug fuck.

262
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,200
My god, I knew you were
a good liar.

263
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,520
But this performance
is unbelievable!

264
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,320
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

265
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,400
Then I'd pay
closer attention.

266
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,120
Don't think you're going to win
this little game of yours.

267
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,080
Because I'm a much better
player than you are.

268
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,000
This is about her
isn't it?

269
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,520
Do you think
I'm that blind?

270
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,920
Is she really worth this?
All of it?

271
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,200
Who are you talking about?

272
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,800
I'm talking about you.

273
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,200
A rich little daddy's boy
in way over his head.

274
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,200
This would actually be sad
if you weren't so pathetic.

275
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:48,080
Wait!
You said Peter was dead.

276
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,080
Of course he's dead.
You killed him.

277
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:57,400
Knock knock, mr. Cable
it's time for your M.R.I.

278
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,200
What happened?

279
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:02,400
Ask him.
Sleep well, honey.

280
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,200
You... hey!

281
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,680
Come on, home boy.

282
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,600
I'm gonna take you
on a little trip.

283
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,400
This isn't happening,

284
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,800
Man, I didn't think
you could get any whiter.

285
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,600
But you look like
you've seen a ghost.

286
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,000
You have to lie here.

287
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,000
So?

288
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,680
What'd make someone
wanna kill a nice

289
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,200
all-american dude
like you?

290
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,400
What?

291
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,000
Who said what? Relax, man.
It's just a rumor.

292
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,600
Everyone talks about
everything around here.

293
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,920
Especially nurse Clayton.
Arms down, please.

294
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Nobody was trying
to kill me.

295
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,000
It was just chemical
I was using on the stairs.

296
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Right, yeah.
Fumes must've got to you.

297
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,600
Keep your head still.

298
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,800
Anyway, my point is this:
everybody dies

299
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,680
no mystery there.

300
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,000
But why and how
everyone dies?

301
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,520
That is a mystery
we would solve.

302
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:20,200
Probably the biggest
mystery there is.

303
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,600
Man, you're not
making any sense.

304
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:27,000
I'm not the one who can't
remember what year it is.

305
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,320
Okay.

306
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,880
- What's your name?
- Travis.

307
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,000
Straps, too tight?

308
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,320
Travis, are you going out of
your way to make me nervous?

309
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,000
Hell no, if I wanted
to scare you

310
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,400
I'd just tell you about
the number of tumors

311
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,200
these machines cause.

312
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,200
you hang tight now.

313
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,320
I don't wanna be around
when this thing starts leaking.

314
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,520
I mean scanning.

315
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,400
Dr. Newman will be right along
see you later.

316
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,120
Thanks, Travis.

317
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:15,600
Hey! You, in there.

318
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,200
Fuck.

319
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,800
who is it?

320
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,320
Doctor Newman?

321
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,520
I know this sounds ridiculous
but I've got this...

322
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,080
terrible itch on my nose.

323
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,520
Who is there?

324
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,200
Hey, I don't suppose
you can unstrap me for...

325
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,920
Hello?

326
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,480
Hello?

327
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,720
What are you doing?

328
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,320
My name is Simon Cable.

329
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,480
You want to check
the chart or something?

330
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,880
I don't think I need that!

331
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:22,800
Get off me.
Get the fuck off me!

332
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,280
Somebody! Somebody help me!

333
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,520
Somebody help me!

334
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,920
Sweet jesus.

335
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,880
what the hell just happened?

336
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,600
What are you, some kind of
a lunatic or something?

337
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,280
Who's that?

338
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,200
This is a hospital pal,
not a nuthouse!

339
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,120
Oh, hey doc!
Glad you could make it.

340
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,400
We got a live one here!

341
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,600
- How did I just get here?
- Just get into bed, Mr. Cable.

342
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,080
You shouldn't be up
and about, not yet.

343
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,400
Who are you?

344
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,800
Someone just tried
to kill me.

345
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,400
- Yeah, wacko!
- Mr Travitt, enough.

346
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,520
Giving him some positive
reinforcement, doc.

347
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,280
This is Saint Jude's
hospital.

348
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,200
Do you know
why you're here?

349
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,800
I was just in the M.R.I. room
I was strapped down mister...

350
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,400
No, Mr. Cable, you were admitted
into this room last night.

351
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,800
Now, do you know
why you're here?

352
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,320
I wasn't in this room
last night.

353
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,320
I was alone...
in a private room.

354
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,200
- No offense taken.
- Mr. Cable, look at me.

355
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,320
All I want you to do
is to answer my one question.

356
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,000
Do you know why you are in
the Saint Jude's hospital?

357
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,880
Yes, because of the
staircase.

358
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,880
See, I just need
to talk to my wife.

359
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,880
- Your wife?
- Just find dr. Newman.

360
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,600
He'll know where she is.

361
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,600
We don't have a Dr. Newman
on our staff, mr. Cable

362
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,520
Now, please look, if you
don't calm down I'm...

363
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,000
What do you mean
you don't have a Dr. Newman?

364
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,120
- I was with him all last night!
- Mr. Cable, please!

365
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,320
The doctor who was
here today

366
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,280
a pediatrician.

367
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,480
I talked to him
for about a half hour.

368
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,000
Mr. Cable, please
listen to me.

369
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,000
You have been unconscious
since your car accident.

370
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,400
No, no, it wasn't
an accident.

371
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,080
It was poisoning
you must not have been on duty.

372
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:53,200
You've been involved in a
serious road accident

373
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,320
and the trauma has obviously
affected your memory.

374
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,400
- A car accident?
- Yeah.

375
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,600
And you're lucky
to be alive, actually.

376
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,400
- Last night?
- Yeah.

377
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,720
That's impossible!

378
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:20,400
Swell going, doc.
You calmed him right down.

379
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,200
What are you running
away from, Mr. Cable?

380
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,920
What were you
hoping to find?

381
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:07,600
Your mind's playing tricks
on you mr. Cable, that's all.

382
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,720
- There was no poison?
- No, I'm sorry.

383
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:14,480
And there is no Dr. Newman
on the staff at this hospital.

384
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,080
Look, you've been
unconscious.

385
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,880
So the oxygen supply
throughout your system.

386
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,120
- What's the date?
- What?

387
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,000
The date today?

388
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,400
- July 29th, why?
- And the year?

389
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,680
- The year?
- Yeah, what year is it?

390
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,600
2000!

391
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,800
So you're telling me

392
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:36,880
that it's the year 2000
and I've been in a car accident.

393
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,400
That I wasn't poisoned

394
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,000
and there is no
doctor Newman.

395
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,400
Yeah, that's right.

396
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,600
What about my wife?

397
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,400
- Your wife?
- Yeah, my wife.

398
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,520
actually, your admission
papers have you down

399
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,000
as being single,
Mr. Cable.

400
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,600
Okay, I've just spent
the entire day

401
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,000
wandering this hospital

402
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:02,400
talking to a Dr. Newman.
My wife, a mystery woman

403
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,280
Orderly named Travis.

404
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,280
Now, you want me to believe
that none of this happened?

405
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,480
You want a cup of coffee?

406
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,600
I'm not crazy.
I can't be.

407
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,280
I don't doubt you believe
what you believe, mr. Cable

408
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:16,000
The mind is a remarkable thing

409
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,400
Perhaps your mind is
showing you

410
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,000
something you need to see.

411
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,280
So being poisoned
and nearly murdered

412
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,800
this is what I need
to see?

413
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,600
It's not for me to say.

414
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,600
I have been in this
hospital before

415
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,600
but two years from now.

416
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,680
This is not my mind playing
tricks on me, this happened.

417
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:34,000
And this is where you met
a Dr. Newman

418
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,920
and an orderly named travis?

419
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,200
Yes, will meet.

420
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,920
You know, it's possible
you could be suffering

421
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:42,200
from a preoccupied delusion
Mr. Cable.

422
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,480
- It wasn't a delusion.
- Just consider.

423
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,120
While you were unconscious
you fabricated a story

424
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,280
then stored it deep
within your memory banks.

425
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,520
So that now awake
when you look back on it

426
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,120
it appears as real as
any true memory.

427
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,080
It was as real as
these walls, or you.

428
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:59,400
Even when you're unconscious
your senses are alive.

429
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,320
You have overheard things

430
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,800
and then incorporated them
into your delusion.

431
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,200
You said Travis, the patient
in your room is Travitt.

432
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,400
You met a Dr. Newman
I'm Truman.

433
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,680
It's like in a dream.

434
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,320
You think you heard a siren
and then when you're wake

435
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,720
you realize
it's only your alarm.

436
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,720
Hey, wacko, you know
what I've been thinking?

437
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,880
I swear I know you
from somewhere, I mean

438
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,120
Were you anybody
been in the papers or anything?

439
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,720
What about Anna?
Is she also just part of the dream?

440
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:29,000
Yes, Mr. Cable, I would
venture that she is.

441
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:32,600
I just want to remember.
I have to.

442
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,200
Sorry to interrupt, doctor.

443
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,480
I wanted to bring in
one of my nursing students

444
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,800
to check Mr. Hungout's
vitals if that's okay.

445
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,200
That's fine, nurse Clayton
go right ahead

446
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,000
okay, what the hell
was she doing here?

447
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,520
- It's just nurse Clayton?
- But she was in my dream.

448
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:51,120
Mine, too, hey what's
she wearing in yours?

449
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,200
How are you today?

450
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,680
That's... but you said...

451
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,600
what? What is it?

452
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:06,320
That's... she's my wife!

453
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,720
Anna?

454
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:10,080
Yes?

455
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,480
Anna have you been here
in the last 24 hours?

456
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,200
No, is everything
okay, doctor?

457
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,480
Mr. Cable, I need you to
get into bed right now.

458
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,800
How could I know her name, huh?
How could I?

459
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,600
I know who you are.
I got it.

460
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,400
You're the son of that
dead rich guy, aren't you?

461
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,320
You're all in on this

462
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,200
You're all out of your
fuckin' minds!

463
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,600
I know I was here!
I was in this goddamned room!

464
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,200
Anna!

465
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,800
Tell him you know me!

466
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,800
- A Dactyl ten.
- Tell him you know me!

467
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,320
Mr. Cable, just come
and sit down, will ya?

468
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,800
- It wasn't a dream!
- I know.

469
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,280
- That was real, and this isn't.
- Just relax.

470
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:42,200
This is bullshit!
What are you doing?

471
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,800
This is for your own good.

472
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,800
No! No, please

473
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,400
- That's it.
- I'm telling you.

474
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,320
You're not real!

475
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,480
Who's there?

476
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,320
What do you want?

477
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,880
What do you want?

478
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,720
Get away from me!

479
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:17,520
Doctor!
Doctor, doctor, doctor!

480
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,480
- Has to be on the door.
- You're gonna hurt yourself.

481
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,080
This is around that
goddamn door!

482
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,920
Keep your head still.
- Mr. Newton...

483
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,200
- Someone behind that door!
- Nurse?

484
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,800
Please!
He's right there!

485
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:30,320
- Five milligrams Diazefam
- No, no!

486
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,800
Simon, listen very carefully
to what I'm saying.

487
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,880
You've been prescribed
a drug that's known to have

488
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,720
mild psychiatric
side effects.

489
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:41,400
No one in the hospital
who's gonna kill you.

490
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,800
There's no one behind the door

491
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,320
Well if you're so sure
then look.

492
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,120
Simon, please.

493
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,680
Look behind the
fucking door!

494
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,920
Okay, I know.
Just look behind the door.

495
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:54,600
Not to see if there is someone there

496
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,520
but to prove to me that
there isn't someone there.

497
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,280
This will relax you.

498
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,720
C ward I'll join you
there in a minute.

499
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,400
Don't leave!
Don't you leave me!

500
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:11,000
Simon, I have other
patients who need me

501
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
but they're not
about to die!

502
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,600
Neither are you.

503
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,480
And that's a promise.

504
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,720
Goddamn you people!

505
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:45,120
Mr. Cable, please have some
consideration for others.

506
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,720
Then get me off this thing.

507
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,000
The doctor's orders
were quite clear.

508
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:52,720
Yeah, I know, I know
but I'm claustrophobic

509
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,480
One hand.

510
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,000
Yeah, well, it'll keep you
quiet for a moment.

511
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,520
But just a moment.

512
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,120
Mr. Cable, I am not
going to fight you.

513
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,120
What I will do is
call security.

514
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,200
Mr. Cable, you're meant
to stay here

515
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,200
until you're ready to...

516
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,800
What are you looking for?

517
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,600
He was here.
I know he was.

518
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,000
It's 2002.

519
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,080
Someone just tried
to kill me.

520
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,000
I promise you, kid,
that is not true.

521
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,320
- Pralidoxime is known.
- You're not listening to me.

522
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,800
Someone tried to kill me
before the nightmare

523
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:40,880
Just after that orderly
left me

524
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,000
strapped to that
goddamned machine.

525
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,200
You've got to believe me
someone came into the room...

526
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,800
Take it easy, kid.

527
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:51,120
Try and relax.
Take a breath.

528
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,600
Good, okay.

529
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,520
Now, I wanna show you
something I think may help,

530
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,400
And that's me
waking you up.

531
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,200
Keep your head still.

532
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,400
No masked intruders
my friend.

533
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,400
It was so real
I, I just...

534
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:37,680
Under the influence of
some psychoreactive drugs

535
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:40,880
nightmares can be
indistinguishable from reality.

536
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,800
It couldn't have been
a nightmare.

537
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,720
You saw it
for yourself, Simon.

538
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,480
You were all alone
in that room.

539
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:50,720
I know I was here two years
ago, after my accident.

540
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,600
See now that's good.

541
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,280
I told you to start
remembering.

542
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:55,000
And the quicker
that happens

543
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,200
the quicker you accept
what really happened

544
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,280
the quicker you'll finally
be able to move on.

545
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,720
Yeah, but still, I...

546
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,520
It wasn't as if I was
remembering the past.

547
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,600
It was as if I was
part of it.

548
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,520
I could interact
with the people there.

549
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,800
I got it figured out then.

550
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,600
Maybe whoever it was that came
after you

551
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,920
was part of your memory too.

552
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
That's why he never
showed up on the tape.

553
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,920
I'll just sit here
and look pretty.

554
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,520
Was there ever
a Doctor Truman here?

555
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,520
Truman?
That vaguely rings a bell.

556
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,680
Yes, 'cause I remember
nurse Clayton.

557
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,800
And uh, and a
patient named Travitt.

558
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:32,320
No shit? There's a
Travitt on the fifth floor.

559
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:33,520
- What?
- Yeah.

560
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,600
Heart transplant patient.

561
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,880
Been waiting here
about two years.

562
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,000
May I help you?

563
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,200
I'm just uh...
Looking up a friend.

564
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,280
But it's two o'clock
in the morning.

565
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:00,000
What the fuck are you
looking at?

566
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,120
I'm so glad to see you.

567
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:07,200
Hey, got a cigarette?

568
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,480
No, he hasn't.

569
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,400
How you doing, doc?

570
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,200
Mr. Cable, I think we should
leave Mr. Travitt to sleep.

571
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,480
Oh, no.

572
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,600
Plenty of time to sleep

573
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,480
when you unplug me
from all this shit.

574
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,480
Don't you recognize me?

575
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,880
Grim reaper?

576
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,480
We were in this hospital
together two years ago.

577
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,120
They come and they go.

578
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,400
Come on, Mr. Travitt.
Please.

579
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:38,120
- Think back, 2 years.
- It doesn't matter.

580
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,520
Yes, it does!

581
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:42,120
I was in this hospital
two years ago I know I was

582
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:44,000
and he was here with me!

583
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:51,880
Holy shit, wacko!

584
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,880
Are you sure, Mr. Travitt?

585
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,880
Abso-fucking-lutely, yeah.

586
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,200
This guy almost
shouted the place down.

587
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:08,600
I see they won't let you
escape from this place either.

588
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,120
It wasn't a delusion then.

589
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:14,200
I was here two years ago.
It was real.

590
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,120
This is good.
Isn't it, doc?

591
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,480
Isn't it?

592
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,000
So you think you're feeling up
to a few more questions?

593
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,400
Simon Cable, born July 4th.

594
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:32,200
- My name?
- Dr. Newman, Justin?

595
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:35,880
Jeremy, close enough.
And the date?

596
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:36,880
Is it tomorrow?

597
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:41,280
Then it's the
30th of July, 2002.

598
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:44,120
I'm impressed, kid.
Who's the president?

599
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,200
Don't worry about it.

600
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,480
Let's get you back
down to your room.

601
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:52,120
Is uh, Mr. Travitt ever going
to make it out of here?

602
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:58,400
There's only one inescapable rule
in the game of life, kid.

603
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,120
Sooner or later everybody
has to stop playing.

604
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:03,280
Whoops, that's me.

605
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,200
I think it'd be better
if you've got some sleep.

606
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:10,720
Thank you, doctor.
I know I haven't been easy.

607
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:11,680
Of course
we're not done with you yet.

608
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:12,800
We have a puzzle downstairs.

609
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,000
That still needs to be
put together.

610
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,520
I think I just might
be up for that now.

611
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,880
Okay.

612
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,600
Simon?

613
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:37,200
Where have you been?

614
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,880
I've been looking
everywhere for you.

615
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:39,520
I know, I'm sorry.

616
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,400
I shouldn't have run off.
I just...

617
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,600
It just seemed so cruel
what you were saying.

618
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,800
You have to believe me.
I'm not making this up.

619
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,800
I'm not trying to hurt you.

620
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,200
I honestly don't remember
who you are.

621
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,880
The doctor swears
my memory will return, but

622
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,680
It just might
take some time.

623
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,520
I've got time.

624
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,880
I'll help you.

625
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,600
If I did something
to hurt you...

626
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,600
Claire.

627
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,720
My name is Claire.

628
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,320
Going down?

629
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,600
Yeah.

630
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,520
Sorry.

631
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:43,280
Freight elevator's broken.
This never happens.

632
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:48,120
This never usually happens.

633
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,120
You're going back up
I assume?

634
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,800
Yeah, we must have
missed our floor.

635
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,880
There's one thing
I don't understand.

636
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,120
How, how can you and I.

637
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,000
- I thought I was...
- You're married.

638
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,200
Yeah.

639
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,680
I don't regret it, Simon.
Any of it.

640
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,200
it was you.

641
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Anna knew.

642
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,400
No, she didn't.
That's impossible.

643
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:45,520
Yes, she did, something.
She said, she, she knew.

644
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,120
She was pissed.

645
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,800
I mean, really pissed.

646
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:52,480
You don't love her, Simon.

647
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:58,120
What we have is
something really amazing.

648
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,400
Anna doesn't matter.

649
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,880
I know what we were
and what you felt.

650
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,680
It's just waiting
to be remembered.

651
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,880
Some things just
don't get lost.

652
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:20,000
I don't know
what to believe anymore.

653
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,600
I'll come back then.

654
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:27,400
- wWe'll just take this slow.
- Claire, wait!

655
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,880
I love you, Claire.

656
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,880
Finally, he says it.

657
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Yeah, but don't leave me
out here all exposed.

658
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,600
I love you too, Simon.

659
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:46,480
I wish I didn't, but I do.

660
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:51,400
I think this is my favorite
room in the whole house.

661
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:56,720
All these things growing.
I could live in here.

662
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,800
Back in a minute.

663
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:26,720
Simon, what we just
said to each other.

664
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,400
It's serious.

665
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,520
I know.

666
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:34,200
I really don't need
this drama, you know?

667
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
I don't think
we have a choice.

668
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:39,880
We always have a choice,
Simon.

669
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,120
I remember...

670
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,120
What?

671
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:10,480
The sunroom...
You...

672
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,880
I remember loving you

673
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,320
I told you

674
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,800
some things just
don't get lost.

675
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,400
Sometimes...

676
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,200
I can't help but
think that

677
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:36,480
we're paying for
what happened.

678
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:42,880
What do you mean?

679
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,200
I'll come back.

680
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,800
Think of me.

681
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:03,520
Claire?

682
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,000
Claire?

683
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:10,800
Claire!

684
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:30,120
How about a glass of water?
Since you're up.

685
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:31,600
What the hell
are you doing here?

686
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:33,800
You're not going to start acting
funny on me, are you?

687
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:35,880
How the hell did you get down
here? You were just up...

688
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,520
Off we go.

689
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:42,160
- It's the year 2000, isn't it?
- All year.

690
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:44,480
You know, the egyptians have
these things called calendars.

691
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:45,920
- You might wanna get one
- Mr. Travitt.

692
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,400
Will you please stop
pressing that button?

693
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:51,400
Wacko is flying
high again, doc.

694
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:54,880
Give him a shot in the ass
with something or break my balls.

695
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:14,320
How are you feeling
right now?

696
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,280
Any dizziness?
Shortness of breath?

697
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:18,720
No.

698
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:25,920
I have some difficult
news for you.

699
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:27,680
Concerning your brother.

700
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,720
We did everything
we could for him.

701
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,520
Is there anyone we can
contact for you?

702
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,160
Your parents or...

703
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:44,320
No, both our parents
are dead.

704
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:47,280
I don't know what friends
he had up here.

705
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:48,480
The last few years

706
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:50,800
we didn't really
get together that much.

707
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:53,200
If it makes you feel any better

708
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:56,320
you donated blood to
your brother last night.

709
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:58,200
What did he need
my blood for?

710
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:01,520
I needed a transfusion
after the accident.

711
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,600
He was with me?

712
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:14,200
Wait, I, I thought
I had the accident before.

713
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,200
Great.

714
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:39,000
H.G. Wells
back from the future.

715
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:41,000
It's been a long night.

716
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:46,320
You're completely loony
you know that, don't you?

717
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:57,520
So, you want to talk about
horse racing?

718
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:58,720
What?

719
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:01,800
Tomorrow morning, they're
going to open me up

720
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:03,600
and cut out my heart.

721
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:07,160
Gonna replace it with
mechanical pump that's

722
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:10,600
supposed to keep me going until
my transplant comes through.

723
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:15,400
I like playing the horses.

724
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:18,400
I like long shots.

725
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:22,760
I mean, if this is the
last conversation

726
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:26,000
I'm ever going to have
I'd, I'd like...

727
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:30,480
Ah, forget it.

728
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:35,520
You're not going to die.

729
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:37,400
So, you're a doctor now?

730
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:40,800
No, time traveler.

731
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:42,800
Just like you said.

732
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:54,480
I've seen tomorrow.
Trust me.

733
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:56,720
You're not gonna die.

734
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:06,880
You feel up to
seeing her now?

735
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:08,560
And who would that be?

736
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:10,200
Your brother's fiance.

737
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:19,600
Why not?

738
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,200
Thanks.

739
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:33,880
Hi, I'm Simon.

740
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:35,920
It's so nice to
meet you.

741
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:38,800
Jesus.

742
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:55,120
No.

743
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:56,720
Sorry?

744
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:59,400
There's no way
you are engaged to him.

745
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:01,280
Not even in my
twisted head.

746
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:03,800
I was just having
some coffee, I...

747
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:06,320
I wasn't really
looking to get married.

748
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:17,280
Actually, now that
you're here

749
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:19,120
I do have a couple
of questions for you.

750
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:22,000
Yeah?
About what?

751
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:26,080
The car accident
last night?

752
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:28,760
And about your brother

753
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:32,600
I need you in the ICU
Miss Hathaway.

754
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:34,880
Okay, we can finish
this later.

755
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:36,800
We can finish what later?

756
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,200
Simon?

757
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:57,360
Claire?
Jesus, are you okay?

758
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:59,200
I've been thinking about you
but every time...

759
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:01,000
It's true about Peter.

760
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:08,600
You were engaged to him?

761
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:13,000
Oh, my god.
How could this be happening?

762
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,200
You were with Peter
and I knew?

763
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:20,600
Simon, stop, what's
wrong with you?

764
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:25,600
We were having an affair?

765
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:27,880
He was my brother, Claire.

766
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:30,320
- Don't do this, not now.
- Well didn't you loved him?

767
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:31,400
Stop it.

768
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:32,720
Did you ever love him?

769
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:34,200
Of course I loved him.

770
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:37,120
things change.
You know all this, Simon.

771
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:42,000
And us? Why?

772
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:02,800
I guess now we have
one of those moments.

773
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:07,280
you know, people are always
talking about them.

774
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:11,600
Something that happened
in the past, so...

775
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:16,200
A moment that you wish you could
go back to and change

776
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:21,800
something you wish you could
have said or done differently.

777
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:27,680
So, would you?

778
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,400
Change what happened?

779
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,280
Wouldn't you?

780
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:41,280
It's really good
to see you, sir.

781
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:46,320
Was that your
brother's fiance?

782
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:58,400
What do you want
Miss Hathaway?

783
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:03,280
You know, you can call me
Anna, if you want.

784
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,400
I just want to tell you
something if you had a second.

785
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:07,360
What?

786
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:10,720
Well, I think you'll like this story
'cause it's about your brother.

787
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:14,080
I was alone in the ICU
when he woke up.

788
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:15,360
What do you mean
he woke up?

789
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:17,680
It was really beautiful
you know this one last

790
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:19,920
fight for life
before he died.

791
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:25,600
Always check the patient's
blood pressure, Mr. Cable?

792
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:27,200
Nurse Clayton!

793
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:30,400
Patient has recovered
consciousness! Vitals are dropping!

794
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:35,800
Simon did this to me.

795
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:40,000
Simon killed me.

796
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:48,720
I left it on by mistake
in my pocket.

797
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:50,400
I hate it when I do that.

798
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:52,800
Do you want some coffee?

799
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:56,000
No, that's wrong.

800
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:59,920
I would never do anything
to hurt him.

801
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:01,520
Are you sure about that?

802
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:03,280
What, what does this
even matter to you?

803
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:04,720
'Cause I think
you're lying.

804
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:05,800
I am not lying.

805
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:07,600
How would you know?
You've been so confused.

806
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:08,320
Not about that.

807
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:10,880
I would know
if I'd killed my own brother or not.

808
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:20,480
See, you're not really
sure, are you?

809
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:21,600
Why are you doing this?

810
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,520
Truth is anything could've
happened that night

811
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:24,880
and you wouldn't know it.

812
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:27,520
Who are you?
Who are you?

813
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:29,680
I guess I'm nobody.

814
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:33,520
Not like you.
Rich family, glamorous.

815
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:35,520
I'm just a girl who's

816
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:37,680
trying really hard
to be seen.

817
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:41,280
Bet you see me now.

818
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:42,880
You're going to
blackmail me.

819
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,400
You've gonna blackmail me.

820
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:47,400
I love all those pictures
of you in the magazines.

821
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:49,920
Going to parties.
Living the life.

822
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:51,200
You're fucking nuts.

823
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:55,480
Won't it be so
nice to be part of it all?

824
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:57,680
You listen to me.
I would never hurt my brother.

825
00:52:57,720 --> 00:52:59,400
Do you understand?

826
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:03,000
If you want, I can go to the police.

827
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:04,800
I'm sure they'd
decide quickly.

828
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:06,600
What you would
or wouldn't do.

829
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:17,200
Would it be okay
if I called you Simon?

830
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:20,160
You know 'cause
we're going to be

831
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:21,600
seeing a lot of each other
from now on.

832
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:23,400
You're psychotic!

833
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:35,520
Wait!
You can't do this!

834
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:10,720
- I just don't give a fuck.
- Not anymore I don't.

835
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:12,160
It's just not going to happen.

836
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:14,880
Come on, man.
I just fucking screwed up.

837
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:16,480
You screwed everything up, Simon!

838
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:17,200
Mom was too easy on you.

839
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:19,600
I'm glad dad didn't live long
to see what you've turned into.

840
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:21,520
You know, I don't have to
listen to that shit anymore.

841
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:22,000
I'm sick of it!

842
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:23,400
Oh, you're sick?
How do you think I feel?

843
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:24,480
I'm sick of it!

844
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:27,120
- Get out of my house!
- Your house?

845
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:28,680
- Our house!
- It's my house!

846
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:30,480
Now, get out, Simon.
This time you lose!

847
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:32,720
You can't just
kick me out, Pete.

848
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:35,400
Where the hell
are they going?

849
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:47,200
Stay away from me!

850
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:50,320
Stay away from me!

851
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:09,280
All right, Mr. Travitt.
If you have other...

852
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:13,600
I told you someone
was trying to kill me.

853
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:16,880
I told you, but nobody
wanted to listen.

854
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:20,480
Okay, Mr. Cable.

855
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:23,800
can't you just let me...

856
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,720
I had no choice.

857
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:38,080
Mr Travitt.

858
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:40,560
No, it's not Travitt
it's that one.

859
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:41,600
The one who was waiting
behind the door.

860
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:43,000
The one that was
trying to kill me.

861
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:44,280
I told you to look!

862
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:46,080
I told you
to fucking look!

863
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:53,680
I'm... Just let me go.

864
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:54,800
Yes?

865
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:58,800
Help me!
Somebody!

866
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:35,000
Security to second floor.
security to second floor.

867
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:38,200
Don't do this to me!
No, don't do this to me!

868
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:41,000
- He's in that room.
- Alright.

869
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:52,200
In the stairs!

870
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,800
Shit, I'm still here.

871
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:53,680
My god.

872
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:55,920
Again?

873
01:00:57,600 --> 01:00:58,400
You killed him.

874
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:02,320
No, this isn't real!
You understand?

875
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:03,680
This can't be real.

876
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:10,400
Do not move!

877
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:29,800
- Hey, Cable, my man, slow down.
- It's you?

878
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:32,080
Last time I checked, yeah.
You okay?

879
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:33,680
Come on.

880
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:37,520
Look, I don't want mean to
be outta line or nothing

881
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:40,880
but you're really starting
to scare me here, you know?

882
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:44,200
- You okay?
- Wait.

883
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:46,720
Hey! Cable!

884
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:02,720
Oh, shit.

885
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:07,680
Thank god!
You're alive.

886
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:10,200
Matter of opinion, wacko.

887
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:13,400
What's the problem?
You look worse than me.

888
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:15,120
Mr. Cable, will you
please leave?

889
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:16,880
He's alright, see?

890
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,360
He's just fine!
It was just all in my head.

891
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:22,720
Why don't you go back
down the stairs to your own room.

892
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:23,920
I need you to tell me

893
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,480
about my brother's death.
Peter Cable, 2 years ago.

894
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:28,000
I need to know exactly
what happened!

895
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:28,960
The soup tastes weird.

896
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,120
It's the same as yesterday's
mr Travitt.

897
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:32,760
In fact, it probably
is yesterday's.

898
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:35,000
You were here, I need
to know what happened.

899
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:35,960
Doctor Newman said

900
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,320
you should remember things
at your own pace, Mr. Cable.

901
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:40,600
But I can't!
I'm running out of time!

902
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:42,320
The soup is too goddamned salty.

903
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:42,600
Please!

904
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:44,720
Like my wife she'd oversalt
the shit out of everything.

905
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:45,760
- I need you!
- Mr. Travitt

906
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:47,400
I'm sorry the food isn't
up to your standards

907
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:50,080
but it's the best I can...

908
01:02:56,480 --> 01:03:00,080
calm down! Calm down!
Calm down, calm down!

909
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:02,200
Oh, god, he's
hemorrhaging!

910
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:04,200
- What is it?
- Gurney now!

911
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:05,840
And find Newman!

912
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:07,160
You need to help me!

913
01:03:07,160 --> 01:03:08,400
It's not my fault!

914
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:10,200
Give me your hands now!

915
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:13,080
Press here firmly!

916
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:14,560
Okay, mr Travitt.
Both hands!

917
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:19,680
- There's so much blood.
- I didn't mean to do it, I...

918
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:21,200
Move! Move! Both!

919
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:24,480
Nurse, get him
some oxygen!

920
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:30,320
Give me a chest setting
for spreaders!

921
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:36,880
We're going to have to
hyperventilate.

922
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:39,680
Clear airway.

923
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:43,280
For christ's sake, I just
told you it was my fault!

924
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:44,200
I killed him!

925
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:45,920
This has nothing
to do with you.

926
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:48,000
I killed him!

927
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:40,400
Jesus.

928
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:02,080
Let go of my arm
Mr. Cable.

929
01:07:02,080 --> 01:07:06,600
Okay, please tell me about
Peter cable, two years ago.

930
01:07:08,080 --> 01:07:11,600
Can you page
Dr. Seymour for me, please?

931
01:07:11,640 --> 01:07:13,120
What happened to
my brother?

932
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:18,200
He was brought in
by the paramedics.

933
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:21,680
I think there were
3 of you.

934
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:23,520
Human M.V.A:s arrived
We got two.

935
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:25,000
There's one en route.

936
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:28,080
Your brother's injuries
were so severe

937
01:07:28,120 --> 01:07:31,400
Mr Cable, that after surgery

938
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,880
he was hooked up to
life support on the I.C.U.

939
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:38,360
where he died.

940
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:40,800
Yeah, I'm sorry.

941
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:43,920
Was nurse Hathaway
in the I.C.U. that night?

942
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:46,000
Why don't you ask her
yourself?

943
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:54,480
You know I know
she was here.

944
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:58,320
- Claire, hospital.
- What do you want?

945
01:07:58,320 --> 01:07:59,000
Just wanna make sure that

946
01:07:59,120 --> 01:08:01,520
you're playing by the
rules of the game

947
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:05,960
I gave into you.

948
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,400
You remember.

949
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:09,880
What a surprise.

950
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:11,280
You're completely out of
your fucking mind.

951
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:12,800
You realize that?

952
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:15,400
See, there's
the old Simon I know.

953
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:16,880
You coming home, honey?

954
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:19,280
- Not to you.
- Want to bet?

955
01:08:21,720 --> 01:08:22,880
You're bleeding.

956
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:27,000
I don't know
what happened.

957
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:27,920
You hit your head
in my memory.

958
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:29,400
And now you're bleeding.

959
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:32,000
I killed Travitt
and now he's dying.

960
01:08:33,720 --> 01:08:36,400
Anyway, now that you've made
your breathtaking recovery.

961
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:38,920
Are we clear on the terms
of our arrangement?

962
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:41,400
- It's over.
- I will decide when it's over.

963
01:08:41,440 --> 01:08:42,800
No, you won't.

964
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:44,600
The thing is, Anna.

965
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:46,400
None of this is
gonna to happen.

966
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:49,720
The thing is, Simon.
It happened.

967
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:51,200
And I'm going to
change it.

968
01:08:51,280 --> 01:08:53,200
Everything's going to
be different!

969
01:08:53,240 --> 01:08:54,480
You can't change anything.

970
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:56,400
This isn't going to
end like this!

971
01:08:56,440 --> 01:08:57,720
I won't let it!

972
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:06,480
Take me back!
One, two, three, four!

973
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:11,720
Shit.

974
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:14,280
That was stupid.

975
01:09:23,280 --> 01:09:24,480
Simon?

976
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:28,080
I love you, Claire.

977
01:09:29,280 --> 01:09:31,120
Finally, he says it.

978
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:37,120
I love you too, Simon.
I wish I didn't, but I do.

979
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,920
I think this is my favorite
room in the whole house.

980
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:44,400
All these things growing.

981
01:09:45,280 --> 01:09:46,720
I could live in here.

982
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,120
Back in a minute.

983
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:33,280
Simon, what we just said
to each other.

984
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:39,000
Serious, I mean.
It's really serious.

985
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:42,280
We do have a choice.

986
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:46,080
What are you saying?

987
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:48,280
I'm saying.

988
01:10:51,200 --> 01:10:53,280
As much as I love you
Claire,

989
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:57,000
He's my brother.

990
01:10:57,800 --> 01:10:59,640
I just can't do this
to him.

991
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:01,520
But you can do it to me?

992
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:04,800
I have to...

993
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:10,080
Peter.

994
01:11:14,280 --> 01:11:15,600
Peter, wait!

995
01:11:16,720 --> 01:11:18,880
Peter, please.
Can we talk about this?

996
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:20,680
I don't want to talk,
Claire.

997
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:22,000
I don't even want to
look at you!

998
01:11:22,040 --> 01:11:22,800
Peter, I...

999
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:26,600
Claire! Get the fuck out!

1000
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:28,720
Oh shit.

1001
01:11:40,280 --> 01:11:44,720
Wait! Claire!
Claire, wait!

1002
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,520
We really need
to talk, Pete.

1003
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:30,600
I don't think I have anything
left to say to you, Simon.

1004
01:12:30,720 --> 01:12:32,080
Peter, please.

1005
01:12:32,200 --> 01:12:34,080
she was my fiance
Simon!

1006
01:12:34,120 --> 01:12:35,960
Nothing happened
between us.

1007
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,480
You have to believe me.
She, she loves you.

1008
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:39,520
She's in love with you.

1009
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:42,800
- You don't know that.
- Simon, I want you out of the house.

1010
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:45,800
Pete, I didn't mean for
any of this to happen.

1011
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:47,120
You make me sick.

1012
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:49,800
You are not ending up
with her.

1013
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:51,880
Peter, don't go up there.
I made a mistake!

1014
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:53,840
Your whole life's a mistake, Simon!
Mom was too easy on you

1015
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:55,800
I'm glad dad didn't live
long enough to see what you've...

1016
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:57,760
Why is it always
have to be about this?

1017
01:12:57,800 --> 01:12:59,560
This is what its about.
I'm sick of it!

1018
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:01,520
- Now, get out of my house!
- It's our house!

1019
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:03,280
- It's our...
- It's over, get out Simon.

1020
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:04,160
This time you lose!

1021
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:06,480
Wait! Don't!
Don't go out!

1022
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:08,400
Don't go out there!

1023
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:11,800
Peter!

1024
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:30,000
Peter.

1025
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:35,000
Jesus!
Hang on, man.

1026
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:39,600
Peter, just keep
breathing.

1027
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:44,800
You okay?

1028
01:13:45,720 --> 01:13:49,000
I'm going to change, man.
I promise, I'll be different.

1029
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:51,000
I'm gonna get you
to the hospital.

1030
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:52,600
You're gonna make it, man.

1031
01:14:18,280 --> 01:14:20,200
You're going to be
alright, Pete.

1032
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:35,920
I'm going to get you
to the hospital.

1033
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:23,520
Come on! Just go!

1034
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:36,600
You're going to be
alright, Pete.

1035
01:15:36,720 --> 01:15:38,400
There won't be an accident.

1036
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:23,720
Back that truck up, now!

1037
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:26,000
Caucasian male.

1038
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:32,280
Lacerations to the head and neck.
Possibly thirty years old.

1039
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:34,280
Get these cars out of here.

1040
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:46,480
Are you alright?
You okay?

1041
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:49,000
Take it easy now man.
I'm gonna to take you on a little trip.

1042
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:36,200
Peter?

1043
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:38,000
Simon?

1044
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:40,080
Back here.

1045
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:00,720
A fire in summer?

1046
01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:06,000
I wanted a fire.
I figured why not

1047
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:08,080
learning to live
a little.

1048
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:11,920
It's really good
to see you, sir.

1049
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:13,520
It's good to see you, too.

1050
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:19,520
Come here.

1051
01:18:30,200 --> 01:18:33,520
- Are you okay?
- I don't know.

1052
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:35,920
No one says
you have to know.

1053
01:18:39,400 --> 01:18:43,520
Anyway.
I know you like bread.

1054
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:44,600
Great.

1055
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:50,280
I was thinking how much
I've missed seeing you,

1056
01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:52,880
like when we were kids.

1057
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,720
Oh, god, we used to be up
in that attic for hours.

1058
01:18:55,720 --> 01:18:56,880
Yeah.

1059
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,600
You know Pete, I don't even
remember why we stopped talking.

1060
01:19:01,640 --> 01:19:03,000
Doesn't matter now.

1061
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:05,280
You're here.
We're talking.

1062
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:06,800
That's all I wanted.

1063
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:11,000
I'm not sure I can remember
what happened, Peter.

1064
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:12,400
Your memory again?

1065
01:19:13,400 --> 01:19:16,480
I just I need to know
what happened.

1066
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:19,600
Why do you want to go
over this again?

1067
01:19:26,720 --> 01:19:29,920
You fell through
the skylight?

1068
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:31,200
Is that what happened?

1069
01:19:35,200 --> 01:19:37,280
I think you know
exactly what happened.

1070
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:39,720
It's just too tough
for you to face it.

1071
01:19:39,720 --> 01:19:41,400
Which I can understand

1072
01:19:42,600 --> 01:19:44,480
Well, but what about
Claire?

1073
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:49,520
She was coming back
for you, Simon.

1074
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:01,920
You were driving us
from the house,

1075
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:03,280
from the cliffs.

1076
01:20:03,280 --> 01:20:05,080
There's only one road.

1077
01:20:05,120 --> 01:20:06,600
There was no way
you could have seen.

1078
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:11,600
Seen what, Peter?

1079
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:24,480
I can't help but think that
we're paying for what happened.

1080
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:29,120
It wasn't supposed
to happen like this.

1081
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:30,600
Doesn't matter now.

1082
01:20:33,400 --> 01:20:37,000
There's only one inescapable
rule in the game of life, kid.

1083
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:41,600
Sooner or later
everybody has to stop playing.

1084
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:46,200
No, wait a minute.
There's something wrong, Peter!

1085
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:48,280
There's something wrong!

1086
01:20:48,280 --> 01:20:49,920
I was going to change
everything.

1087
01:20:51,400 --> 01:20:53,280
This is your choice, Simon.

1088
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:57,400
I thought I could
change it.

1089
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:01,920
You need to leave
this behind you, Simon.

1090
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:04,880
For Claire.
For me.

1091
01:21:05,720 --> 01:21:06,880
For dad.

1092
01:21:08,480 --> 01:21:10,200
You died, Simon.

1093
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:12,080
We all did.

1094
01:21:12,720 --> 01:21:15,720
And you can't move on from all
of this until you let go.

1095
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:18,200
Let it go.

1096
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:22,000
I need another chance.

1097
01:21:22,040 --> 01:21:23,920
I know I could do better.

1098
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:30,880
Simon, how many more chances
do you think you should get?

1099
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:38,280
Are you alright?

1100
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:39,760
You okay?

1101
01:21:39,800 --> 01:21:40,400
Take it easy man.

1102
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:42,280
I'm going to take you
on a little trip.

1103
01:21:45,720 --> 01:21:46,880
Dr. Truman, M.V.A.s arrived.

1104
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:48,600
- What have we got?
- We got two, there's one en route.

1105
01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:50,760
This is Mr. Simon Cable.

1106
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:53,800
- BP, one ten over forty.
- Watch your backs.

1107
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:00,400
M.V.A., we need assistance.

1108
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:02,600
One, two, three.

1109
01:22:02,720 --> 01:22:03,840
Time is twenty hundred hours.

1110
01:22:03,880 --> 01:22:05,000
He's crashed!
Get the defrib!

1111
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:09,200
- No pulse
- One, two, three, four, five.

1112
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:12,080
One hundred.

1113
01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:14,880
- Charging
- Clear!

1114
01:22:18,280 --> 01:22:19,600
Two hundred.

1115
01:22:34,600 --> 01:22:37,400
It's your choice, Simon.
Where you go.

1116
01:22:37,720 --> 01:22:39,200
It's your choice.

1117
01:22:40,280 --> 01:22:44,400
Time of death
20:02.

1118
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:58,000
Easy. 
Diazepam, five milligrams.

1119
01:22:58,040 --> 01:22:59,600
Easy now, Mr. Cable.

1120
01:22:59,640 --> 01:23:01,200
You're going to be fine.

1121
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:03,040
You were just having
a nightmare.

1122
01:23:03,080 --> 01:23:04,800
You're in a hospital
Saint Jude's.

1123
01:23:04,840 --> 01:23:06,000
I'm doctor Jeremy Newman.

1124
01:23:06,080 --> 01:23:09,600
I'm assigned your case.
You were admitted last night.

1125
01:23:09,640 --> 01:23:10,880
You don't remember?

1126
01:23:11,800 --> 01:23:16,280
This is the 29th of July.
The year is 2002,

1127
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:19,400
and your wife,
whose name is Anna,

1128
01:23:19,440 --> 01:23:21,280
is waiting outside.

1129
01:23:21,400 --> 01:23:23,800
You died, Mr. Cable.
