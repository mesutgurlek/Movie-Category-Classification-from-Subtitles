1
00:02:24,591 --> 00:02:28,118
Life is
a spinning wheel, it has been said.

2
00:02:28,195 --> 00:02:31,824
With each spoke,
a tale to be told.

3
00:02:31,898 --> 00:02:34,560
So keep silence
along the banks,

4
00:02:34,634 --> 00:02:37,364
and I will tell you
one ofthese tales.

5
00:02:37,437 --> 00:02:41,498
A story as enchanting
as the jungle itself.

6
00:02:41,575 --> 00:02:45,443
It is about pride
and powerand treasure...

7
00:02:45,512 --> 00:02:49,175
and about fangs
and claws and talons.

8
00:02:49,249 --> 00:02:52,548
But mostly, it is about love.

9
00:03:20,647 --> 00:03:23,514
My new command was
at the edge of the world,

10
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:26,882
surrounded by
a million miles ofjungle.

11
00:03:28,255 --> 00:03:30,553
With me was my daughter, Katherine,

12
00:03:30,624 --> 00:03:33,650
whom everyone called Kitty.

13
00:03:33,727 --> 00:03:36,389
Leading us was an Indian guide...

14
00:03:36,463 --> 00:03:40,024
whose son was called Mowgli.

15
00:03:41,268 --> 00:03:43,202
From the moment they were born,

16
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:45,500
Mowgli and Kitty had a common bond,

17
00:03:45,572 --> 00:03:50,236
for both oftheir mothers had left
this world while bringing them into it.

18
00:03:53,246 --> 00:03:57,342
Also with us was my good friend,
Dr.Julius Plumford,

19
00:03:57,417 --> 00:03:59,351
who was to be oursurgeon.

20
00:03:59,419 --> 00:04:00,852
Oh, look atthat.

21
00:04:24,878 --> 00:04:28,279
- Damned elephant!
Pullyourselftogether!

22
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:32,315
Shere Khan.

23
00:04:35,956 --> 00:04:39,483
-All right.That's enough.
That's enough!

24
00:04:42,329 --> 00:04:45,730
I say, could somebody
possibly grab this elephant?

25
00:04:45,799 --> 00:04:47,733
Sorry to botheryou.

26
00:04:56,176 --> 00:05:00,237
-And as surely as
a tiger named Shere Khan...

27
00:05:00,313 --> 00:05:02,679
was to be the jungle's
royal keeper,

28
00:05:02,749 --> 00:05:05,684
Mowgli was destined
to become its lord.

29
00:05:05,752 --> 00:05:09,586
-Well done, Mowgli.

30
00:05:09,656 --> 00:05:12,989
Buldeo, what on earth's going on?
-Shere Khan!

31
00:05:13,059 --> 00:05:14,788
He's returning!

32
00:05:14,861 --> 00:05:18,456
-Shere? Atiger?
-Shere Khan, king oftigers!

33
00:05:18,531 --> 00:05:21,364
He's angry because these men with
their guns have gone into his jungle...

34
00:05:21,434 --> 00:05:23,299
and killed more
than they can eat.

35
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:26,362
What is a tiger caring,
a few animals here orthere?

36
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:29,374
Would you allow someone to break
into your house and stealyourfood?

37
00:05:29,442 --> 00:05:33,936
-These three broke the jungle law.
Shere Khan knows it.

38
00:05:35,548 --> 00:05:37,277
We best beware.

39
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:59,415
All right.

40
00:08:01,327 --> 00:08:03,022
What is this?

41
00:08:03,096 --> 00:08:04,495
Baloo.

42
00:08:04,564 --> 00:08:06,327
-And in English?
- Bear.

43
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:08,128
Good.

44
00:08:08,201 --> 00:08:11,466
I'll betyou can't tell me
what this is.

45
00:08:11,538 --> 00:08:13,506
Bagheera.

46
00:08:16,509 --> 00:08:18,170
Panther?

47
00:08:18,244 --> 00:08:20,940
Very good.

48
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:24,506
And who do you think this is?

49
00:08:24,584 --> 00:08:27,212
-That's me!
-You? Shere Khan?

50
00:08:27,287 --> 00:08:30,154
The holy man say I'm halfa tiger.

51
00:08:30,223 --> 00:08:32,282
You are half a tiger?

52
00:08:32,358 --> 00:08:35,885
He saywhen I see Shere Khan
and show no fear,

53
00:08:35,962 --> 00:08:38,487
then I be whole tiger.

54
00:08:38,565 --> 00:08:41,295
Where did you see
this holy man, Mowgli?

55
00:08:41,367 --> 00:08:43,631
In my dreams.

56
00:09:13,099 --> 00:09:15,033
No.

57
00:09:18,238 --> 00:09:20,672
Help!

58
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:23,675
Tiger.! Tigerattack.!

59
00:09:28,581 --> 00:09:30,606
Geoffrey,what in God's name
is going on?

60
00:09:30,683 --> 00:09:33,618
Atiger!
I think it got Claibourne!

61
00:09:33,686 --> 00:09:35,517
Claibourne? Right.
I'll see to him.

62
00:09:42,829 --> 00:09:45,127
Stay here, Mowgli!

63
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:53,262
- Bapu?

64
00:10:05,385 --> 00:10:06,716
Damn!

-Shere Khan!

68
00:10:42,889 --> 00:10:45,414
Ha!
Shoot him, Buldeo! Ha!

69
00:10:55,835 --> 00:10:58,770
God! Mowgli!

70
00:10:58,838 --> 00:11:00,931
Mowgli!

71
00:11:04,677 --> 00:11:06,474

Oh, my God!The boy!

76
00:13:24,317 --> 00:13:27,286
Where's Mowgli, Father?

77
00:13:29,622 --> 00:13:32,557
He's gone, Kitty.
The boy is gone.

78
00:13:46,172 --> 00:13:48,766
Bapu?

79
00:13:52,845 --> 00:13:54,870
Bapu?

80
00:13:56,582 --> 00:13:58,516
Bapu?

81
00:13:59,819 --> 00:14:02,185
Bapu?

82
00:14:21,741 --> 00:14:26,075
Bapu? Bapu?

83
00:14:47,633 --> 00:14:49,897
Bagheera.

84
00:15:05,284 --> 00:15:07,343
Shere Khan.

85
00:17:29,495 --> 00:17:32,828
- Baloo?

86
00:26:23,328 --> 00:26:25,796
Keep up, ladies, keep up!

87
00:26:25,864 --> 00:26:29,891
Now,who can tell me what kind
of monkey that is overthere?

88
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:33,904
Nevermind, nevermind.
Um--

89
00:26:35,474 --> 00:26:38,568
Whataboutthose overthere?
Who can name those? You see them?

90
00:26:39,645 --> 00:26:41,408
[ Dr. Plumford]
Anybody?

91
00:26:43,649 --> 00:26:45,583
Kitty!

92
00:26:47,386 --> 00:26:49,320
Yes, Doctor?

93
00:26:49,388 --> 00:26:52,983
Perhaps you can name the primates
thatwe are aboutto paint.

94
00:26:54,126 --> 00:26:57,118
Thatone there is a macaque,

95
00:26:57,195 --> 00:26:59,891
those two are rhesus,

96
00:26:59,965 --> 00:27:03,662
and the bunch up there are langurs.

97
00:27:03,735 --> 00:27:07,262
Well, at least I've taught
somebody something.

98
00:27:07,339 --> 00:27:10,137
Oh, my goodness!
There's a spidermonkeywith a mustache!

99
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:12,506
-Oh,where?
-Where?

100
00:27:12,577 --> 00:27:14,943
He's gota white haton
and a linen suit.

101
00:27:25,023 --> 00:27:26,991
Now,this bridge...

102
00:27:27,059 --> 00:27:31,325
separates mankind
from the animal kingdom.

103
00:27:31,396 --> 00:27:34,923
To cross overthere is
to take your life in your hands.

104
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,197
You see this sign?
Itsays, ""Danger:

105
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:42,229
""to cross this bridge
is to enterthe black jungle,

the jungle of death.''

107
00:27:44,876 --> 00:27:47,674
-Actually, Doctor,
- Hmm?

108
00:27:47,746 --> 00:27:51,614
all the sign says is,
""Beware,this bridge is old.''

109
00:27:52,851 --> 00:27:55,786
It's a very literal
translation, Kitty.

110
00:27:55,854 --> 00:27:58,789
Come on, ladies.
We'll do our painting down there.

111
00:28:01,259 --> 00:28:03,989
- I dare you to cross it.
- I would never.

112
00:28:04,062 --> 00:28:07,395
- Neitherwould I.
-Well, I certainlywouldn't.

113
00:28:07,466 --> 00:28:09,400
I would.

114
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:13,736
Why am I notsurprised?

115
00:28:32,124 --> 00:28:34,354
- Hello.

116
00:28:46,972 --> 00:28:48,997
Hello?

Hello?

118
00:30:05,383 --> 00:30:07,510
He'll killyou.

119
00:30:37,349 --> 00:30:39,374
Whoa!

120
00:30:39,451 --> 00:30:41,385
- Hello,William.
-Whatare you doing here?

121
00:30:41,453 --> 00:30:43,853
You're notsupposed to cross the bridge.
You know it's dangerous.

122
00:30:43,922 --> 00:30:46,288
- I know, I know.
-You're a very naughty girl.

123
00:30:46,358 --> 00:30:49,657
- Not in public,Willie.
- Public?

124
00:30:49,728 --> 00:30:52,162
What public?
[Snickers]

125
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:56,633
I seem to remember our last kiss
being quite public.

126
00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:02,462
Heatofthe moment, my good man.
Heatofthe moment.

127
00:31:02,541 --> 00:31:05,874
-Nowwe best get back across the bridge.
-I should warn you.

128
00:31:05,944 --> 00:31:09,038
I'm feeling quite the huntertoday.

129
00:31:09,114 --> 00:31:11,480
And am I to be your prey?

130

131
00:31:20,292 --> 00:31:22,226
Why,you little savage!

And what have we here?

133

An animal.An animal that needs to be

I'll protectyou.

136
00:31:39,811 --> 00:31:43,406
Actually,William, I think

All right, I'll take it,
butonly if you promise to leave.

164
00:36:39,277 --> 00:36:41,211
There. Go now.

165
00:36:43,047 --> 00:36:45,515
What is itwith you
and flowers and kissing?

166
00:36:48,446 --> 00:36:51,347
- Billy! Billy!

167
00:36:51,415 --> 00:36:54,441
It's the savage we fought
in the jungle. He's here.

168
00:36:54,519 --> 00:36:56,680
What?

169
00:37:01,125 --> 00:37:03,389
Who are you?

170
00:37:05,329 --> 00:37:08,321
- Do you speak English?

171
00:37:08,399 --> 00:37:10,697
No. Hindi?

172
00:37:13,237 --> 00:37:15,603
Do you speak anything?

173
00:37:15,673 --> 00:37:18,164
Don'ttouch that.

174
00:37:18,242 --> 00:37:20,403
Oh. I told you.

175
00:37:21,646 --> 00:37:24,581
Here.

176
00:37:29,153 --> 00:37:31,212
- It's all right.

177
00:37:33,357 --> 00:37:35,291
It's all right.

178
00:37:59,784 --> 00:38:01,649
Where did you getthis?

179
00:38:03,654 --> 00:38:07,249
Where did you getthis?
This used to be mine.

180
00:38:11,629 --> 00:38:15,292
Mowgli.
Mowgli.

181
00:38:16,734 --> 00:38:19,328
I'm Kitty.

182
00:38:19,403 --> 00:38:22,338
Kitty Brydon.

183
00:38:22,406 --> 00:38:25,273
-Oh, God!You've gotto leave quickly.

184
00:38:25,343 --> 00:38:27,277
- Go.! They'll kill you. Go.!
-Get him!

185
00:38:27,345 --> 00:38:28,835
- No!William.
-Are you all right?

186
00:38:28,913 --> 00:38:30,881
-Yes. I'm fine.
-Are you sure?

187
00:38:30,948 --> 00:38:32,882
- Did he touch you?
- No, no, no. He's harmless.

188
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:34,884
-Wilkins!
-Gone!Just listen to me.

189
00:38:34,952 --> 00:38:36,817
All right, stay here
and lock the door.

190
00:38:36,888 --> 00:38:39,516
No, please.You don't understand.
William!

191
00:38:43,728 --> 00:38:46,196
There he is!
On the wall!

192
00:39:05,182 --> 00:39:08,549

Come down here! Get down here!
Down, down, down!

00:40:45,783 --> 00:40:48,911

00:40:48,986 --> 00:40:50,920
-Go ahead.You've got him!

201
00:41:07,171 --> 00:41:10,902
-Are you all right?

202
00:41:41,138 --> 00:41:43,800
Hunaman.

203
00:41:48,546 --> 00:41:51,743
Thank you, Buldeo.
That's Queen's evidence now.

204
00:41:52,983 --> 00:41:54,917
Yes, Captain, sahib.

205
00:41:59,824 --> 00:42:02,224
Stolen from some
rich maharaja, no doubt.

206
00:42:02,293 --> 00:42:04,227
No doubt.

207
00:42:04,295 --> 00:42:06,160
Captain, sahib.!

208
00:42:07,398 --> 00:42:10,629
That dagger... is having
very importantfamily.

209
00:42:10,701 --> 00:42:14,228
-Come on.

210
00:42:32,289 --> 00:42:35,588
Ah, my favorite officers.
Evenin', gents.

211
00:42:35,659 --> 00:42:37,593
- Harley.
- Evening, Harley.

212
00:42:37,661 --> 00:42:39,754
And what have we
got here,then?

213
00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:42,924
Caught this one attempting
to kill the Colonel's daughter.

214
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,400
Well,we can't be having
any ofthat now, can we?

215
00:42:45,469 --> 00:42:47,437
And...we found this on him.

216
00:42:47,505 --> 00:42:49,564
May have a brotherand sister.

217
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:53,872
Well,we can't be separatin'
no family now, can we?

218
00:42:53,944 --> 00:42:57,209
- No,we mostcertainly cannot.
- Right.

219
00:42:58,349 --> 00:43:00,943
Come on, my little
brown brother.

220
00:43:01,018 --> 00:43:05,421
Time to wake up.Tell Uncle Harley
where you gotthe dagger.

221
00:43:05,489 --> 00:43:07,684
Come on!

222
00:43:07,758 --> 00:43:10,921
You little--

223
00:43:10,995 --> 00:43:13,862
Hold him! Hold him!
Push him in! Push him in!

224
00:43:13,931 --> 00:43:16,263
Sergeant Harley.!
Come to order, ifyou please.!

225
00:43:18,769 --> 00:43:21,431
What is going on here?

226
00:43:21,505 --> 00:43:24,474
This is the, uh, intruderwe caught.

227
00:43:24,542 --> 00:43:28,273
I'm aware ofthat, but does
detaining a prisonermean you
have to beat him halfto death?

228
00:43:28,345 --> 00:43:30,336
He kicked me in the sweets, sir.

229
00:43:30,414 --> 00:43:32,405
- Yoursweets, eh, Harley?
-Sir!

230
00:43:32,483 --> 00:43:35,884
-What's his name?
-  Don't know, sir.

231
00:43:35,953 --> 00:43:38,114
What is your name?

232
00:43:46,730 --> 00:43:50,496
If I may say so, sir, congratulations
on your perfect Hindi, sir.

233
00:43:50,568 --> 00:43:53,264
-Shut up,Wilkins.
-Sorry, sir. Stupid--

234
00:43:54,338 --> 00:43:56,829
He, um, hasn'tsaid a word.

235
00:43:56,907 --> 00:43:59,171
Notyet, anyway.

236
00:43:59,243 --> 00:44:01,177
But I can assure you, sir,

237
00:44:01,245 --> 00:44:05,306
I intend to investigate
this business personally.

238
00:44:07,718 --> 00:44:11,313
All right, Boone.You're a good man.
I will entrust him to your care.

239
00:44:11,388 --> 00:44:13,788
Kindly showthe boy some charity.

240
00:44:13,857 --> 00:44:16,417
-Carry on.
-Very good, sir.

241
00:44:24,068 --> 00:44:26,195
You heard the man, Sergeant.

242
00:44:26,270 --> 00:44:29,239
Showthe boy some... charity.

243
00:44:46,790 --> 00:44:48,815
Stupid jungly!

244
00:45:12,549 --> 00:45:14,608
- Father?
- Katherine, how are you?

245
00:45:14,685 --> 00:45:17,347
Fine.What is that boy
doing in the dungeon?

246
00:45:17,421 --> 00:45:20,481
Well, it's self-evident. He stole into
the palace and broke into your bedroom.

247
00:45:20,557 --> 00:45:22,582
He's gentle and harmless.

248
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:25,185
Well,tell thatto
Sgt. Harley's sweets.

249
00:45:25,262 --> 00:45:27,230
- I'm sorry?
- Nevermind. Nevermind.

250
00:45:27,298 --> 00:45:30,756
-Anyway,
he's Captain Boone's concern now.
- Father, please, listen.

251
00:45:30,834 --> 00:45:33,428
Speaking of Captain Boone,
no news foryour old father?

252
00:45:33,504 --> 00:45:35,563
- Father, please.
- Hello, Geoffrey.!

253
00:45:35,639 --> 00:45:38,233
Isn't itall very,very exciting?

254
00:45:38,309 --> 00:45:40,368
Exciting? What?

255
00:45:41,612 --> 00:45:45,275
The boy, Father.
He's Mowgli.

256
00:45:46,383 --> 00:45:48,908
Mowgli?
Mowgli,the boy--

257
00:45:48,986 --> 00:45:51,386
Your little friend?

258
00:45:52,556 --> 00:45:55,184
No, itcouldn't possibly be.

259
00:45:55,259 --> 00:45:57,420
He's was five years old.
No child could survive in the jungle.

260
00:45:57,494 --> 00:45:59,462
Notforten minutes,
much less--

261
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:05,500
It's yourmother's bracelet.

262
00:46:05,569 --> 00:46:07,764
I gave this to you
when you were--

263
00:46:07,838 --> 00:46:11,137
Yes, and I gave itto
a small boy named Mowgli. Remember?

264
00:46:11,208 --> 00:46:13,369
Could it be him?

265
00:46:16,847 --> 00:46:19,179
Well, it's our duty
to help him.

266
00:46:19,249 --> 00:46:21,410
Be a fascinating
case study, Geoffrey.

267
00:46:21,485 --> 00:46:24,886
You know, chart his development, his
ability to learn language,to reason.

268
00:46:24,955 --> 00:46:28,584
Find outthe effects of growing up
away from civilization. It's--

269
00:46:28,659 --> 00:46:30,627
-A unique scientific--
-Opportunity!

270
00:46:30,694 --> 00:46:32,628
- Exactly.
- Exactly.

271
00:46:32,696 --> 00:46:34,630
-Thoughtthis out, haven'tyou?
-Justcame to us.

272
00:46:34,698 --> 00:46:38,498
-Spontaneously.
-Whatam I supposed to do?
Invite him forthe weekend?

273
00:46:38,569 --> 00:46:41,732
Well,we've been preparing a place
for him outside in the garden shed.

274
00:46:41,805 --> 00:46:44,035
So he won'tfeel so confined.

275
00:46:44,108 --> 00:46:46,906
Of course.Justcame to you.

276
00:46:46,977 --> 00:46:48,740
Splendid!

277
00:46:48,812 --> 00:46:52,407
-Where did you getthe dagger?

278
00:47:00,391 --> 00:47:04,327
Harley, my dull friend,
your Hindi is worse than your breath.

279
00:47:04,395 --> 00:47:07,330
- He's really something,
this one, isn't he?
- He's an animal, isn't he?

280
00:47:07,398 --> 00:47:09,332
Hello, William,
John, Sgt. Harley.

281
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:13,359
- Miss Katherine!
- Katherine.
Whatare you doing down here?

282
00:47:13,437 --> 00:47:17,430
Dr. Plumford and I believe your
new prisoner's the jungle boy
the villagers all talk about.

283
00:47:17,508 --> 00:47:19,442
-The one raised by the animals?
-Yes.

284
00:47:19,510 --> 00:47:22,536
We wantto help him reenter
man's world,teach him to speak.

285
00:47:22,613 --> 00:47:24,808
But he's vicious and uncivilized.

286
00:47:24,882 --> 00:47:26,816
Then we'll make him civilized.

287
00:47:30,788 --> 00:47:32,983
What did you do to him?

288
00:47:33,056 --> 00:47:36,583
He did itto himself.
We tried to stop him.

289
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:39,686
He has, miss. He's done it to himself.
- He's mad,you see.

290
00:47:39,763 --> 00:47:42,789
Don't putyourfingers
in there, miss. He'll bite them off.

291
00:47:48,372 --> 00:47:50,169
Mowgli.

292
00:47:55,546 --> 00:47:57,980
K-Kitty?

293
00:48:10,894 --> 00:48:13,556
Shh. Billy.

294
00:48:13,630 --> 00:48:18,067
If he can be taughtto speak,
then he can be made to talk.

295
00:48:20,737 --> 00:48:22,705
Come on, Mowgli.

296
00:48:24,408 --> 00:48:29,243
Come on. Good. Nice hot English
bath foryou.You'll enjoy it.

297
00:48:29,313 --> 00:48:31,281
There's nothing
to be scared about.

298
00:48:31,348 --> 00:48:33,816
Splendid.

299
00:48:34,885 --> 00:48:36,853
All right,then.

300
00:48:42,759 --> 00:48:44,693
All right,then.

Animals are ourfrien--

329
00:50:32,269 --> 00:50:34,203
Tongue depressor.
Also friend.

330
00:50:34,271 --> 00:50:36,205
Birds are beautiful.

331
00:50:36,273 --> 00:50:38,173
Birds are b-ful.

332
00:50:38,241 --> 00:50:41,267
- Dr. Plumford, please.
- Kitty, I'm trying to examine him.

333
00:50:41,345 --> 00:50:43,313

334
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:45,371

Birds are beautiful.

00:51:00,497 --> 00:51:03,694
Birds are beautiful.

341
00:51:05,502 --> 00:51:07,868
So is you.

342
00:51:07,938 --> 00:51:09,872
So are you.

343
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:13,398
Yes.You are.

344
00:51:14,711 --> 00:51:17,771
Thank you.

345
00:51:17,848 --> 00:51:20,009
Picking up fast, isn't he?

346
00:51:21,885 --> 00:51:24,911
-Where are we going?

347
00:51:38,635 --> 00:51:41,604
-Animals are friends.

348
00:51:41,672 --> 00:51:45,608
- Isn't that the same bearyou fought?

349
00:51:45,676 --> 00:51:47,610
Saving my life?

350
00:51:47,678 --> 00:51:49,270
Baloo?

351
00:51:49,346 --> 00:51:52,110
Yes, Baloo.

352
00:51:59,389 --> 00:52:01,823
Right hand goes here.

353
00:52:07,497 --> 00:52:11,729
One,two,three,
four,five, six.

354
00:52:11,802 --> 00:52:15,670
One,two,three, [Chuckles]
four,five, six.

355
00:52:17,474 --> 00:52:20,272
- It's all right.

356
00:52:35,726 --> 00:52:38,160
Man, woman,

357
00:52:38,228 --> 00:52:40,526
woman.

358
00:52:40,597 --> 00:52:43,361
One man,two women.

359
00:52:43,433 --> 00:52:45,697
Lucky man.

360
00:52:45,769 --> 00:52:49,170
Good.

361
00:52:53,677 --> 00:52:56,703
-One,two,three. One,two,three.

362
00:52:56,780 --> 00:53:00,307
Horse, saddle,
temple, riverDoctor.!

363
00:53:01,785 --> 00:53:04,754
This big tree--

364
00:53:09,693 --> 00:53:13,561
No,that's nota boat.
That's Queen Victoria.

365
00:53:14,631 --> 00:53:16,531
House, iron,jump, king.

366
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:19,831
Lamp, mail,
quick, royal,victory.

367
00:53:19,903 --> 00:53:22,701
- Extra,yellow, zebra.!
-Very good!

368
00:53:27,344 --> 00:53:29,608
So, can you speak
with the animals?

369
00:53:29,679 --> 00:53:32,079
Yes, butthey speak
notas men speak.

370
00:53:32,149 --> 00:53:35,880
With animals, every move, every look,
every sound has a meaning.

371
00:53:35,952 --> 00:53:39,718
-Aha.
-The jungle speaks to me.

372
00:53:39,790 --> 00:53:42,816
Because I've learned
howto listen.

373
00:53:42,893 --> 00:53:45,589
If you could have spoken
to me the firsttime in the jungle,

374
00:53:45,662 --> 00:53:47,789
whatwould you have said?
Oh!

375
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:53,902
Did you, uh--
Did you feel anything?

376
00:53:57,007 --> 00:53:58,941
Fire.

377
00:53:59,009 --> 00:54:01,239
Fire?

378
00:54:01,311 --> 00:54:03,905
Agreatfire.

379
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:07,108
Oh.

380
00:54:07,184 --> 00:54:09,345
It's late.
We'd better go.

381
00:54:09,419 --> 00:54:11,387
Please, stay here.

382
00:54:12,556 --> 00:54:15,024
With me.

383
00:54:16,092 --> 00:54:18,219
I can't.

384
00:54:18,295 --> 00:54:21,355
There are conventions,
formalities,

385
00:54:21,431 --> 00:54:23,456
things thatare just not done.

386
00:54:23,533 --> 00:54:26,730
I must do what's civilized.

387
00:54:28,872 --> 00:54:31,397
Whatmust I do?

388
00:54:43,286 --> 00:54:45,846
- Katherine!
- Hello, Father.

389
00:54:45,922 --> 00:54:50,086
Don'tyou ""Hello, Father'' me!
I've had men combing the whole
bloody district looking foryou.

390
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:53,254
Where were you? You were with
that jungle boy,weren'tyou?

391
00:54:53,330 --> 00:54:55,389
Mowgli, Father.
His name is Mowgli.

392
00:54:55,465 --> 00:54:58,662
Savage! He's bred in the jungle,
raised by animals.

393
00:54:58,735 --> 00:55:02,034
It's not rightfor a girl
of your standing, of your background.

394
00:55:02,105 --> 00:55:05,700
It's-- It's not done. Do you hear?
It's just not done!

395
00:55:05,775 --> 00:55:08,266
What's not done?
I haven't done anything.

396
00:55:08,345 --> 00:55:11,940
- People are beginning to talk.
-Well, people always talk, Father.

397
00:55:12,015 --> 00:55:14,313
Ijustwantwhat's
bestforyou.

398
00:55:14,384 --> 00:55:17,751
Well, I think you want
what's bestforyou.

399
00:55:29,232 --> 00:55:31,257
I'm sorry, Father.

400
00:55:32,269 --> 00:55:34,362
Yes,well, so am I.

401
00:55:34,437 --> 00:55:37,838
It's my fault, dragging you
halfway around the world.

402
00:55:37,908 --> 00:55:42,845
Well, I'm thinking... perhaps
it's in your best interest if I...

403
00:55:42,913 --> 00:55:45,040
send you home.

404
00:55:45,115 --> 00:55:48,107
To England? But India's my home.
I love it here.

405
00:55:48,184 --> 00:55:51,210
In England you'd have dozens
of handsome young suitors.

406
00:55:51,288 --> 00:55:54,917
It's time you turned
yourmind to... settling down.

407
00:55:54,991 --> 00:55:58,392
- I've plenty oftime forthat.
- No, no.There's no good reason
foryou to stay on.

408
00:55:58,461 --> 00:56:01,555
Unless

409
00:56:01,631 --> 00:56:05,158
- Unless, of course,
there's a better offer.

410
00:56:05,235 --> 00:56:08,136
- Hmm?
-Yes, Father.

411
00:56:39,836 --> 00:56:42,964
All right,
what's this all about?

412
00:56:43,039 --> 00:56:46,941
What it is all about,
my good Captain, sahib,

413
00:56:47,010 --> 00:56:49,171
is the lostcity of Hunaman.

414
00:56:49,245 --> 00:56:51,372
Yeah,yes,
I knowthe legend.

415
00:56:51,448 --> 00:56:56,044
- It is nota legend!
-Oh, no, sahib.
Mostcertainly it is not.

416
00:56:56,119 --> 00:57:00,749
Many thousand years ago
in the time of Hunaman,

417
00:57:00,824 --> 00:57:03,486
deep in the heart
of black jungle,

418
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:06,028
there was a most
magnificentcity.

419
00:57:06,096 --> 00:57:10,897
All people in Asia traveling there
for a chance to save their souls.

420
00:57:10,967 --> 00:57:14,869
- Boughttheirway
into heaven, did they?
-Ah,yes.

421
00:57:14,938 --> 00:57:18,271
And the treasures,
they're piling higher and higher.

422
00:57:18,341 --> 00:57:22,937
'Til one day black jungle
is becoming very angry...

423
00:57:23,013 --> 00:57:25,106
and is swallowing the whole city.

424
00:57:25,181 --> 00:57:27,672
And itwas lostforever?

425
00:57:27,751 --> 00:57:32,882
And all these centuries,
it's been waiting for
the rightman to come and find her.

426
00:57:32,956 --> 00:57:34,821
Men like us.

427
00:57:34,891 --> 00:57:38,850
Lots of men have gone
in search of lostcity,

428
00:57:38,928 --> 00:57:41,328
but no one
is ever returning.

429
00:57:41,398 --> 00:57:45,061
To go into the black jungle is
to invite death. Understand?

430
00:57:45,135 --> 00:57:47,899
Unless, of course,
one knows the way.

431
00:57:47,971 --> 00:57:50,337
-The jungle boy!
- Precisely.

432
00:57:50,407 --> 00:57:54,571
But, uh, getting
his cooperation...

433
00:57:54,644 --> 00:57:58,171
may take some... persuasion.

434
00:58:03,887 --> 00:58:06,583
Whatyou looking at?

435
00:58:06,656 --> 00:58:11,684
- I have seen that hat.
-That's King Louis of France.

436
00:58:11,761 --> 00:58:14,855
King Louis. If you see him,

437
00:58:14,931 --> 00:58:17,331
tell him I know
who took his hat.

438
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:19,334
I'll do that.

439
00:58:19,402 --> 00:58:21,336
Captain William Boone.

440
00:58:21,404 --> 00:58:25,773
- Mind yourmanners, Mowgli.
Hello,William.

441
00:58:25,842 --> 00:58:30,176
Hello, my dear. I thought
I'd pay you a surprise visit...

442
00:58:30,246 --> 00:58:34,876
seeing as we've been, uh,too busy
to see each other of late.

443
00:58:34,951 --> 00:58:37,784
I broughtyou these.
I knowthey're yourfavorite.

444
00:58:37,854 --> 00:58:40,322
Thank you.

445
00:58:40,390 --> 00:58:42,415
You're very sweet.

446
00:58:43,460 --> 00:58:47,328
So... lessons
going well, I hope?

447
00:58:47,397 --> 00:58:50,423
-Verywell.
-Good, good.

448
00:58:56,106 --> 00:58:59,974
Attentive fellow, isn't he?
-Yes,very.

449
00:59:00,043 --> 00:59:04,605
I've been doing a lot
ofthinking... aboutyou and I.

450
00:59:04,681 --> 00:59:06,615
-You have?
-Yes.

451
00:59:06,683 --> 00:59:09,481
And, uh,well--

452
00:59:12,522 --> 00:59:16,322
Katherine Ann Brydon,
willyou marry me?

453
00:59:16,392 --> 00:59:19,884
-William, I'm flattered.
-Good.Then it's settled.

454
00:59:19,963 --> 00:59:22,830
- Butmy father's planning on
sending me back to England--
-Shh.

455
00:59:22,899 --> 00:59:26,494
I've already spoken to yourfather,
and he feels this is the better offer.

456
00:59:26,569 --> 00:59:29,003
Oh, I don't knowwhatto say.

457
00:59:30,173 --> 00:59:32,164
Then don'tsay anything.

458
00:59:34,644 --> 00:59:38,910
Oh, Katherine,we shall be
the most perfectcouple in all India.

459
00:59:38,982 --> 00:59:43,442
-We'll have success,wealth, power.
- Love?

460
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:45,818
Yes,yes,thattoo,
of course.

461
00:59:47,824 --> 00:59:53,057
You know, I feel awful.
I've been quite remiss in my duties
to you of late, haven't I?

462
00:59:53,129 --> 00:59:57,122
I'll tellyou what.Why don't
I take yourfriend--What's his name?

463
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:59,964
- Mowgli.
- Mowgli. Mowgli.Yes.

464
01:00:00,036 --> 01:00:05,474
Why don't I take him for a tour ofthe
palace.You'd like that,wouldn'tyou?

465
01:00:05,542 --> 01:00:09,569
You know,William,you can be quite
sweetwhen you putyourmind to it.

466
01:00:09,646 --> 01:00:13,412
This one is a personal
favorite ofmine.

467
01:00:13,483 --> 01:00:17,647
You, um--You thrust it into your
opponent's belly, like that,you see?

468
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:20,712
And then you
twist ita little...

469
01:00:20,790 --> 01:00:24,487
and you rip out his stomach.

470
01:00:24,561 --> 01:00:26,552
Then do you... eat him?

471
01:00:26,629 --> 01:00:30,258
- No, of course not.
- Does he wantto eatyou?

472
01:00:30,333 --> 01:00:33,131
Why, no.

473
01:00:33,203 --> 01:00:35,694
Then why kill him?

474
01:00:36,773 --> 01:00:39,298
Because he's your enemy.

475
01:00:39,375 --> 01:00:41,343
What is enemy?

476
01:00:41,411 --> 01:00:43,971
Someone you hate.

477
01:00:45,515 --> 01:00:47,745
What is hate?

478
01:00:52,822 --> 01:00:57,122
Fifteenth century. Smart little buggers
back then,weren'tthey?

479
01:00:59,896 --> 01:01:02,091
And this one.

480
01:01:02,165 --> 01:01:05,259
-This one belongs to you, doesn't it?
- Mm.

481
01:01:05,335 --> 01:01:08,065
Where did you get it?

482
01:01:08,137 --> 01:01:10,867
- From Monkey City.
- Monkey City?

483
01:01:12,775 --> 01:01:17,371
Was there more treasure there?
More like this?

484
01:01:17,447 --> 01:01:21,679
In Monkey City,
there's mountains oftreasure.

485
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:26,054
Mountains,you say?

486
01:01:58,521 --> 01:02:01,012
I wantyou to take me
to this, um,

487
01:02:03,359 --> 01:02:05,827
Monkey City of yours.

488
01:02:05,895 --> 01:02:08,625
- No!
- No?

489
01:02:08,698 --> 01:02:11,428
For heaven's sake,why not?

490
01:02:11,501 --> 01:02:14,061
Only those who keep
the jungle lawmay go.

491
01:02:14,137 --> 01:02:18,904
My dear boy, I'm a British officer.
My job is to keep the law.

492
01:02:18,975 --> 01:02:22,308
-You keep notthe jungle law.
- Look here.

493
01:02:23,980 --> 01:02:27,245
I don't know aboutany jungle law,

494
01:02:27,317 --> 01:02:29,911
but I do keep man's law.

495
01:02:29,986 --> 01:02:32,716
And man's law rules around here.

496
01:02:32,789 --> 01:02:35,553
Man has many laws.

497
01:02:35,625 --> 01:02:38,093
Mostabout killing.

498
01:02:38,161 --> 01:02:40,391
You kill for sport...

499
01:02:40,463 --> 01:02:43,193
and anger and treasure.

500
01:02:45,101 --> 01:02:48,764
The jungle law say
we may only kill to eat...

501
01:02:50,006 --> 01:02:52,372
orto keep from being eaten.

502
01:02:52,442 --> 01:02:56,378
You know,you almost
sound like a man,

503
01:02:56,446 --> 01:02:59,574
instead of an animal that's been
trained to sound like one.

504
01:03:01,351 --> 01:03:04,411
The more I learn what is a man,

505
01:03:06,889 --> 01:03:09,653
the more I wantto be an animal.

506
01:03:09,726 --> 01:03:12,160
I huntanimals,you know?

507
01:03:14,330 --> 01:03:16,298
Maybe someday...

508
01:03:16,366 --> 01:03:18,459
you huntme.

509
01:03:22,638 --> 01:03:25,436
Thank you for inviting me, Dr. Plumford.

510
01:03:25,508 --> 01:03:28,773
Oh,think nothing of it,
my boy. Now, look atthat.

511
01:03:28,845 --> 01:03:31,245
The color and majesty of India.

512
01:03:31,314 --> 01:03:34,477
The exquisite manners
and food of England.

513
01:03:34,550 --> 01:03:37,542
All the bare necessities of life.

514
01:03:37,620 --> 01:03:41,181
Oh, incidentally,
I was joking aboutthe food.

515
01:03:41,257 --> 01:03:43,191
Adrian.

516
01:03:52,635 --> 01:03:56,366
My, my, my, but don'twe
look dandy tonight?

517
01:03:56,439 --> 01:04:00,808
-What does he think he looks like?
- I'm notentirely sure, Billy.

518
01:04:00,877 --> 01:04:03,903
But perhaps he could teach us
howthe apes dance, hmm?

519
01:04:03,980 --> 01:04:06,676
-Thatwould be fascinating.

520
01:04:09,085 --> 01:04:12,851
And then we were supposed
to name these monkeys
and I couldn't rememberthe names

521
01:04:28,438 --> 01:04:30,599
Come on.

522
01:05:04,207 --> 01:05:06,471
May I?

523
01:06:08,271 --> 01:06:11,399
Fascinating.
Come, Katherine.

524
01:06:11,474 --> 01:06:14,932
-Yourfather has a little
announcement he'd like to make.
-Thank you.

525
01:06:15,011 --> 01:06:17,673
All right, ladies and gentlemen.

526
01:06:17,747 --> 01:06:21,843
Ladies and gentlemen, if I could
have yourattention please.

527
01:06:21,918 --> 01:06:24,182
I have an announcementto make.

528
01:06:24,253 --> 01:06:27,552
This evening,
to my greatsurprise and delight,

529
01:06:27,623 --> 01:06:32,026
one ofthe finestyoung men that
I've ever had the privilege to know,

530
01:06:32,094 --> 01:06:35,621
has sought my consent
to marry my daughter, Katherine,

531
01:06:35,698 --> 01:06:39,156
-she having accepted his proposal.

532
01:06:39,235 --> 01:06:42,762
Nowadays, of course, parents are
the lastto knowthese things.

533
01:06:42,838 --> 01:06:47,798
Still, never having been one to stand
in the way of progress ortrue love,

534
01:06:47,877 --> 01:06:50,141
I am glad
to give that consent.

535
01:06:50,212 --> 01:06:53,943
And so it is with the greatest pleasure,
that I announce the engagement...

536
01:06:54,016 --> 01:06:57,850
of Katherine Ann Brydon
to Captain William Boone.

537
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:00,115
A toast...

538
01:07:00,189 --> 01:07:02,555
to Katherine and William.

539
01:07:02,625 --> 01:07:04,559
Katherine and William!

540
01:07:20,509 --> 01:07:22,943
What does this mean, Doctor?

541
01:07:24,246 --> 01:07:27,272
Itmeans, Mowgli,
thatthey are to wed.

542
01:07:30,319 --> 01:07:32,810
Itmeans...

543
01:07:32,888 --> 01:07:35,322
she belongs to him.

544
01:07:45,101 --> 01:07:47,262
Excuse me, Doctor.

545
01:07:55,945 --> 01:07:57,879
Dreadfully sorry, old bean.

546
01:07:57,947 --> 01:08:00,040
Pardon me, old chap.

547
01:08:19,802 --> 01:08:22,669
The poorthing.

548
01:08:36,452 --> 01:08:38,886
Let him go.

549
01:08:38,954 --> 01:08:40,979
Katherine!

550
01:08:48,898 --> 01:08:52,390
Mowgli! Mowgli,
where are you going?

551
01:08:53,369 --> 01:08:55,667
-To my home.
-You can't go back.

552
01:08:55,738 --> 01:08:59,230
-You're notan animal.You're a man.
- I am nota man!

553
01:09:03,746 --> 01:09:06,340
And I am notan animal.

554
01:09:07,883 --> 01:09:10,181
Please don't leave.

555
01:09:11,721 --> 01:09:13,848
Why should I stay?

556
01:09:19,829 --> 01:09:23,094
I run with the wolf pack.

557
01:09:23,165 --> 01:09:25,633
You...

558
01:09:25,701 --> 01:09:28,636
must run with the man pack.

559
01:09:29,872 --> 01:09:31,863
It is the properthing.

560
01:09:44,386 --> 01:09:47,981
I will shame your house no more.

561
01:10:12,181 --> 01:10:15,048
You know, I think you
owe me an apology.

562
01:10:15,117 --> 01:10:19,383
-There's been a mistake,William.
- Mistake?

563
01:10:19,455 --> 01:10:22,856
I can'tmarry you.
I won'tmarry you.

564
01:10:22,925 --> 01:10:27,191
No, Katherine!
I think it is you who is mistaken.

565
01:10:27,263 --> 01:10:32,166
I realize this adolescent
infatuation you have with this
savage has addled your brain,

566
01:10:32,234 --> 01:10:37,262
but I can'tallowyou to make
a fool of me and I will not lose
you to some puerile jungle boy!

567
01:10:53,022 --> 01:10:57,857
-You sure you won't reconsider?
After all, Captain Boone is--
- No, Father.

568
01:10:57,927 --> 01:11:01,761
Ah,well.
Sure you'll be very happy in England.

569
01:11:01,831 --> 01:11:04,698
Yes, I'm sure I will be.

570
01:11:04,767 --> 01:11:07,702
I shall miss you dreadfully.

571
01:11:20,282 --> 01:11:22,216
We're ready.

572
01:11:54,183 --> 01:11:58,916
Well, then, where do you suppose
my little brown brother has got to?

573
01:12:01,290 --> 01:12:03,121
Oh, nothin' personal.

574
01:12:08,931 --> 01:12:13,197
Keep youreyes open, laddies.
A bob forthe man thatspots him.

575
01:12:32,388 --> 01:12:35,482
Ahhh!
Me sweets!

576
01:13:08,757 --> 01:13:10,816
Baloo?

577
01:13:12,561 --> 01:13:14,529
Baloo?

578
01:14:08,283 --> 01:14:10,877
Dr. Plumford.!
Dr. Plumford.!

579
01:14:10,953 --> 01:14:13,717
-Where's the doctor?

580
01:14:13,789 --> 01:14:17,247
They just leftto bring Miss Katherine
to the ship to England.

581
01:14:17,326 --> 01:14:20,386
-Where?
-They're on the road toJaipur.

582
01:14:22,586 --> 01:14:24,520
Go on.

583
01:14:26,256 --> 01:14:28,121
Hyah!

584
01:14:28,191 --> 01:14:32,753
You'll absolutely love their house.
Rightacross from Holland Park.

585
01:14:35,399 --> 01:14:38,163
- Bloody hell!
- Bandits. Get down.
-What's happening?

586
01:14:47,577 --> 01:14:49,909
Make room!
Return fire!

587
01:15:02,225 --> 01:15:04,750
- Father! Doctor, help him!
-Geoffrey?

588
01:15:12,335 --> 01:15:15,236
Farewell, sahib!

589
01:15:18,241 --> 01:15:21,506
-You!

590
01:15:37,160 --> 01:15:39,060
Mowgli!

591
01:15:55,245 --> 01:15:57,907
Why did they do this?

592
01:15:57,981 --> 01:16:01,348
Theywantme to come for her.

593
01:16:01,418 --> 01:16:04,353
They know I'll come for her.

594
01:16:04,421 --> 01:16:07,185
You saved my life, Mowgli.

595
01:16:07,257 --> 01:16:09,987
Yes, Doctor.

596
01:16:12,963 --> 01:16:17,332
Now I need you...
to save the life of another.

597
01:16:29,780 --> 01:16:33,443
You bloody swine!
Leave her alone!

598
01:16:33,517 --> 01:16:36,918
-Ow! Getoff me!

599
01:16:39,289 --> 01:16:42,315

What is he doing here?

608
01:17:04,614 --> 01:17:08,015
Thatwasn't partofthe plan,
nowwas it, Buldeo?

609
01:17:08,084 --> 01:17:11,315
- Itwas a mistake.
-Captain Boone.

610
01:17:11,388 --> 01:17:14,323
Am I to understand
you're with this scum?

611
01:17:14,391 --> 01:17:16,552
Much to my surprise, sir.

612
01:17:16,626 --> 01:17:20,255
I have many friends
in low places.

613
01:17:20,330 --> 01:17:22,423
Sgt. Harley?

614
01:17:22,499 --> 01:17:27,129
I've had 25 years ofthe likes ofyou

617
01:17:37,080 --> 01:17:41,574
It's Wilkins, sir. Look,

618
01:17:41,651 --> 01:17:43,949
Oh, shut up,Wilkins.

01:17:44,020 --> 01:17:46,284
Look here.

620
01:17:46,356 --> 01:17:50,292
You're all soldiers
in the British Army.

621
01:17:50,360 --> 01:17:55,093
You're undermy command, and I order
you to return to the fort immediately!

622
01:17:55,165 --> 01:17:58,965
To be hung, drawn or quartered?
No, no, I'm afraid thatwon't do atall.

623
01:17:59,035 --> 01:18:01,162
-This is treason!
-No.!

624
01:18:01,238 --> 01:18:03,263
Oh, God, nowwe're in it.

625
01:18:03,340 --> 01:18:06,776
-Ah!You woman,you!
- How could you do this?

626
01:18:06,843 --> 01:18:10,438
Butyou don't knowwhat's

627
01:18:10,513 --> 01:18:13,744
-Why have you brought us here?

I will take you there,
and we will see who lives.

634
01:19:46,676 --> 01:19:50,271
Why do you suppose
he stares at us like that?

635
01:19:50,347 --> 01:19:54,443
Because to him...
you are food.

636
01:19:56,820 --> 01:19:59,015
Oh, good.

637
01:20:24,214 --> 01:20:26,682
My God!
Listen to that.

638
01:20:26,750 --> 01:20:30,584
Aw, are the noises
botherin'you, sonny?

639
01:20:33,223 --> 01:20:35,191
Can'tyou get'em to shut up?

640
01:20:35,258 --> 01:20:40,093
Aman talking to animals?
Is this done?

641
01:20:42,132 --> 01:20:45,465
Ifwe don't getmy father
to a doctor, he'll die.

642
01:20:45,535 --> 01:20:48,800
He's a British officer.
He can make do.

643
01:20:48,872 --> 01:20:52,774
-So, my jungle friend,

644
01:20:52,842 --> 01:20:55,834
where do we go
from here?

645
01:20:55,912 --> 01:20:58,346
Followthe mountains.

646
01:20:58,415 --> 01:21:02,784
-And then?
-And then, if you are still alive,

647
01:21:02,852 --> 01:21:04,786
I will tell you more.

648
01:21:04,854 --> 01:21:06,822
 Shut up.

649
01:21:06,890 --> 01:21:11,156
-Shut up.

650
01:21:11,227 --> 01:21:14,025
-Shut up!
-Aye. Shut up.

651
01:21:14,097 --> 01:21:16,827
Calm yourself,Wilkins.

652
01:21:46,629 --> 01:21:48,927
-What's that?

653
01:21:48,998 --> 01:21:53,025
Howthe hell should I know? Never
heard anything like that in my life.

654
01:21:53,103 --> 01:21:56,732
It is Shere Khan. He's returning.

655
01:21:56,806 --> 01:22:00,003
Good.
I'd like to bag me a tiger.

656
01:22:00,076 --> 01:22:05,070
Do not be wishing for this tiger, sahib.
He's the devil.

657
01:22:07,150 --> 01:22:09,243
Shere Khan hunts us.

658
01:22:09,319 --> 01:22:13,346
I must protectyou from him.
I mustescape.

659
01:22:13,423 --> 01:22:15,357
-We're going with you.
- No.

660
01:22:15,425 --> 01:22:19,418
It's saferwith these men
and their guns.

661
01:22:21,731 --> 01:22:23,699
Be careful.

662
01:22:25,001 --> 01:22:27,231
I will come back foryou.

663
01:22:28,738 --> 01:22:30,672
I know.

664
01:22:43,686 --> 01:22:45,950
Oh, stop.

665
01:23:08,745 --> 01:23:11,976
Ah!
He's escaped!

666
01:23:12,048 --> 01:23:14,016
Wake up!
He's escaped!

667
01:23:21,257 --> 01:23:24,488
No, no.
No, no!

668
01:23:24,561 --> 01:23:28,497
Boone, help me!
Boone!Wilkins!

669
01:23:28,565 --> 01:23:32,695
-Somebody help me.!
- Harley,whatare you doing in there?

670
01:23:32,769 --> 01:23:36,671
It's quicksand,Wilkins!
It's sucking me down.

671
01:23:36,739 --> 01:23:39,765
- It's gotmy legs!
It's sucking me under!
-Gimme your hand!

672
01:23:39,842 --> 01:23:43,278
-Get--Gimme your hand!

673
01:23:43,346 --> 01:23:46,873
-Stretch to me. Come on.
-Gimme your hand,Wilkins!

674
01:23:46,950 --> 01:23:50,784
-Come on, reach!
- I can't.

675
01:23:50,853 --> 01:23:52,980
-Come on.
-That's a boy.

676
01:23:55,124 --> 01:23:58,116
-Come here.
Harley,you're pulling me. Harley!
- Don't!

677
01:23:58,194 --> 01:24:01,459
- Don't let go.!
-You're pulling me in!

678
01:24:01,531 --> 01:24:04,227
Damn you,Wilkins!

679
01:24:25,054 --> 01:24:27,750
- Harley.
-Well,

680
01:24:27,824 --> 01:24:31,726
let's not be discouraged
by every little thing.

681
01:24:31,794 --> 01:24:34,854
- Let's go.

682
01:24:34,931 --> 01:24:37,365
-Go on.
- Butmy father.

683
01:24:37,433 --> 01:24:40,732
You can't leave my father!
He'll die!

684
01:24:41,638 --> 01:24:44,072
Such is life.

685
01:25:18,141 --> 01:25:20,302
God!

686
01:25:22,045 --> 01:25:25,640
-Come.We must go, quickly.

687
01:25:27,850 --> 01:25:30,580
Hey.

688
01:25:30,653 --> 01:25:34,714
- My friend will take you
back to the village.
- Friend?

689
01:25:43,599 --> 01:25:45,590
An elephant.

690
01:25:45,668 --> 01:25:48,933
It had to be an elephant.

691
01:25:52,308 --> 01:25:54,333
Bring her back forme.

692
01:25:55,745 --> 01:25:57,940
Please.

693
01:26:00,383 --> 01:26:02,613
Mowgli.

694
01:26:04,454 --> 01:26:09,482
I think a man lucky
who can countyou as a friend.

695
01:26:13,830 --> 01:26:16,060
Tut,tut,tut,tut.

696
01:26:20,770 --> 01:26:22,829
Tut,tut,tut,tut?

697
01:26:22,905 --> 01:26:25,567
-Whoa! Bloody elephants!

698
01:26:25,641 --> 01:26:27,632
Bane of my existence.

699
01:26:27,710 --> 01:26:32,340
This'd be a damn fine country ifit
wasn't forall the bloody elephants.!

700
01:26:32,415 --> 01:26:35,316
- Nowthis is just great.

701
01:26:35,385 --> 01:26:37,410
Great.!

702
01:26:43,860 --> 01:26:46,886
Just--Just be careful
with thatthing,willyou?

703
01:26:46,963 --> 01:26:50,194
- Bloody oaf!. ""Join the army,''they say.

704
01:26:50,266 --> 01:26:54,760
""See the world,''they say. This is
singly the most ridiculous thing...

705
01:26:54,837 --> 01:26:57,271
I've everdone in my life.!

706
01:26:57,340 --> 01:27:00,537
Once I get back to soci
Ow.! [ Grunts]

01:27:04,380 --> 01:27:06,746
Bloody jungle.!

709
01:27:29,172 --> 01:27:32,005
My father lives.

710
01:29:10,373 --> 01:29:12,864
Whata shame.

711
01:29:15,411 --> 01:29:18,505
Well, shall we continue?

712
01:29:23,452 --> 01:29:25,886
Kill him.

713
01:29:27,890 --> 01:29:31,291
Mowgli.!

714
01:29:31,360 --> 01:29:34,056
- No!

715
01:29:54,250 --> 01:29:56,184
Come on.

716
01:30:05,127 --> 01:30:07,288
My God!

717
01:30:17,306 --> 01:30:21,675
-What is that?
-  Sounds like monkeys.

718
01:30:21,744 --> 01:30:24,474
- Monkey City.

719
01:30:24,547 --> 01:30:26,515
Shere Khan!

720
01:30:29,952 --> 01:30:33,581
- My God, what are they doing?
-They run from Shere Khan!

721
01:31:03,719 --> 01:31:05,744
Boone?

722
01:31:06,856 --> 01:31:09,086

723
01:31:09,158 --> 01:31:11,285

724
01:31:17,833 --> 01:31:20,131
Boone!

725

726
01:31:31,981 --> 01:31:36,008
-Oops.
- Wilkins.! I am going to be killing you.!

727
01:31:36,085 --> 01:31:39,350
Stupid.

728
01:31:39,422 --> 01:31:41,617
Oh, my God, I've been shot.!

729
01:31:41,691 --> 01:31:43,625
Stupid.

730
01:32:29,405 --> 01:32:32,397
Wilkins!

731
01:32:32,475 --> 01:32:34,909
Wilkins!

732
01:32:43,619 --> 01:32:46,349
You could die too,you know?

733
01:32:46,422 --> 01:32:49,289
He won't letme die.

734
01:32:56,632 --> 01:33:00,068
-You're hurting me.
- Behave yourself and I won't.

735
01:33:11,881 --> 01:33:14,850
Follow him!
Follow King Louis to yourtreasure.

736
01:33:17,453 --> 01:33:19,785
Damn.

737
01:33:34,870 --> 01:33:38,067
See, Katherine?

738
01:33:38,140 --> 01:33:40,370
It's notall that disgusting.

739
01:33:40,442 --> 01:33:43,843
It's notthe place,William:
it's the company.

740
01:34:19,381 --> 01:34:21,872
It's beautiful.

741
01:34:21,951 --> 01:34:24,579
Brilliant.

742
01:34:54,683 --> 01:34:57,345
- Mowgli!
-Come on!

743
01:35:38,260 --> 01:35:40,421
I'm knowing you are down here,

01:35:40,496 --> 01:35:43,158
my little man cub.!

745
01:36:13,362 --> 01:36:15,353
Huh?

746
01:36:20,469 --> 01:36:23,404
My leg!

747
01:36:48,063 --> 01:36:50,088
No!

748
01:37:10,853 --> 01:37:14,482
Help me!

749
01:37:17,526 --> 01:37:19,926
Buldeo?

750
01:37:24,400 --> 01:37:26,561
Buldeo?

751
01:37:44,420 --> 01:37:46,684
- No!

752
01:39:09,771 --> 01:39:13,434
So,you've returned
to sealyourfate, have you?

753
01:39:22,351 --> 01:39:24,615
Friend of yours?

754
01:39:49,545 --> 01:39:51,479
Aha.

755
01:39:58,053 --> 01:40:00,021
Oh, dear.

756
01:40:32,888 --> 01:40:36,119
What do you think you have
that I don't, huh?

757
01:40:41,263 --> 01:40:43,493
Strength of a bear.

758
01:40:43,565 --> 01:40:47,126
-Speed of a panther.
- No!

759
01:40:47,202 --> 01:40:49,466
- No.!
- Heart of a wolf!.

760
01:40:55,244 --> 01:40:57,337
And very sharp teeth.

761
01:40:59,982 --> 01:41:02,143
Oh.

762
01:41:21,236 --> 01:41:23,761
Kitty, come!
We must go quickly!

763
01:41:23,839 --> 01:41:26,672
-We have to take some with us.
-This treasure only brings death!

764
01:41:31,947 --> 01:41:34,279
-Justone thing.
- Please.
- Katherine.!

765
01:41:34,349 --> 01:41:37,785
Look whatwe can have together.

766
01:41:40,088 --> 01:41:43,387
- Katherine, come back.!

767
01:41:44,660 --> 01:41:47,458
All right, go then!
Go!

768
01:41:47,529 --> 01:41:51,090
Go with your jungle boy.!

769
01:41:51,166 --> 01:41:53,361
I gotwhat I came for.!

770
01:41:53,435 --> 01:41:56,734
I don't need you.

771
01:44:21,349 --> 01:44:24,216
What's happening?

772
01:44:27,856 --> 01:44:32,190
Shere Khan sees me notas a man,

773
01:44:32,260 --> 01:44:34,785
butas a creature ofthe jungle.

774
01:45:21,243 --> 01:45:23,302
Hello.

775
01:45:23,378 --> 01:45:26,506
Look who's here.

776
01:45:26,581 --> 01:45:28,811
Baloo.

777
01:45:30,719 --> 01:45:34,348
He was a very good patient.
Hmm? Yes,you are.

778
01:45:34,422 --> 01:45:36,617
Look!

779
01:46:09,124 --> 01:46:11,490
So that is how it came to pass,

780
01:46:11,560 --> 01:46:16,998
that Mowgli, keeperofthe jungle law,
protectorofcreatures great and small,

781
01:46:17,065 --> 01:46:20,159
became lord ofthe jungle.

782
01:46:20,235 --> 01:46:23,295
So listen well
and hearthe call...

783
01:46:23,371 --> 01:46:27,808
and long life
to those that keep the jungle law.
