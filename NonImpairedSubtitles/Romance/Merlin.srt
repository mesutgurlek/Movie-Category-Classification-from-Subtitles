1
00:00:41,542 --> 00:00:44,044
I can't stand the thought of people...

2
00:00:44,045 --> 00:00:47,147
peering, whispering, pointing, at me.

3
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:49,883
We'll live in the forest.

4
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:53,120
Animals don't point and whisper.

5
00:00:53,121 --> 00:00:55,088
But it's a dream, Merlin.

6
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,491
I want to make it real.

7
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:01,762
I've found a place here...

8
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:04,998
and prayer... and meditation.

9
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:08,735
It's a peace that I've never known before.

10
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:11,205
It passes my understanding.

11
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:14,575
To be honest, Nimue...

12
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:18,078
it passes my understanding, too.

13
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:20,614
Why do you shut yourself away here?

14
00:01:20,615 --> 00:01:22,549
To be nearer my God...

15
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:24,785
The nearer you are to him...

16
00:01:24,852 --> 00:01:27,254
the further you are from me.

17
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:32,259
Take off that veil...

18
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,781
Well... where was I?

19
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:56,783
Oh... yes... yes...

20
00:01:58,151 --> 00:01:59,520
Arthur...

21
00:01:59,521 --> 00:02:01,488
had just been born.

22
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:05,125
I fostered him with Sir Hector.

23
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:06,960
Do unto others... as you would

24
00:02:06,961 --> 00:02:08,795
them do unto you.

25
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:11,632
I was his tutor.

26
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:13,634
I didn't teach him magic...

27
00:02:13,635 --> 00:02:15,335
I taught him ethics...

28
00:02:15,336 --> 00:02:16,637
and morals.

29
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:20,807
Arthur...

30
00:02:20,808 --> 00:02:21,975
which is much more difficult...

31
00:02:21,976 --> 00:02:23,477
believe me.

32
00:02:26,013 --> 00:02:28,482
His real father... King Uther...

33
00:02:28,483 --> 00:02:29,917
went mad...

34
00:02:29,918 --> 00:02:31,652
Kill the prisoners...

35
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,988
and killed himself.

36
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:41,728
That brings us up to date... I think.

37
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:44,865
Arthur grew up to be a fine young man.

38
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:46,333
Perhaps, as usual...

39
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:48,035
I expected too much of him... but...

40
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:51,004
he was the vessel of all my hopes.

41
00:02:51,005 --> 00:02:52,339
Arthur, don't charge around like that...

42
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:53,707
the horses don't like it.

43
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:54,842
And don't get off...

44
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:56,343
we're leaving right away.

45
00:02:56,344 --> 00:02:57,578
Merlin, have you heard the news?

46
00:02:57,579 --> 00:02:59,780
- Rupert...
- King Uther's dead!

47
00:03:00,747 --> 00:03:01,715
Didn't you hear what I said?

48
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,350
The king is dead!

49
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,285
- I know...
- Know?

50
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,688
How could you know out here in the woods?

51
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,858
A little bird told me.

52
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:12,359
Where are we going?

53
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,027
To make you king!

54
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:20,367
Merlin... tell me...

55
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,703
how can I be king?

56
00:03:22,704 --> 00:03:25,038
Because, you were born to it...

57
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:26,874
I've no royal blood in me!

58
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:28,876
Merlin...

59
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:33,981
Stand aside...

60
00:03:33,982 --> 00:03:35,549
this is a job for a man!

61
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:36,783
That old windbag... look at him!

62
00:03:36,784 --> 00:03:37,818
If he's not careful,

63
00:03:37,851 --> 00:03:39,720
he'll do himself an injury!

64
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:53,100
Arthur kept asking me...

65
00:03:53,101 --> 00:03:54,735
but I wasn't ready.

66
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:56,737
The truth about his father...

67
00:03:56,738 --> 00:03:57,938
the death of Cornwall...

68
00:03:57,939 --> 00:04:01,074
my part in the whole squalid plot.

69
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:03,577
No wonder I found it hard to tell him...

70
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:06,713
besides...

71
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:08,248
I was distracted.

72
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:51,959
Defense!

73
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:49,683
Thank-you...

74
00:05:50,918 --> 00:05:52,686
I did nothing...

75
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,855
I wasn't talking to you.

76
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:58,525
What was that?

77
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:02,462
That... that was a message...

78
00:06:03,297 --> 00:06:05,032
from an old friend.

79
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:25,052
Arthur wanted me to explain...

80
00:06:25,053 --> 00:06:26,553
- Why won't you tell me?
He couldn't know...

81
00:06:26,554 --> 00:06:27,888
that explaining everything...

82
00:06:27,889 --> 00:06:29,056
settles nothing.

83
00:06:29,057 --> 00:06:31,558
Yes, it's... it's time.

84
00:06:31,559 --> 00:06:33,894
I hoped he'd understand my part of it.

85
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:36,430
Arthur...

86
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:39,333
you should know that...

87
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:42,236
Sir Hector isn't your real father.

88
00:06:43,504 --> 00:06:45,005
Your father was King Uther...

89
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:46,740
and you...

90
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:49,409
are the true heir to the throne.

91
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:53,480
It turned out better than I'd hoped.

92
00:06:53,481 --> 00:06:54,915
If I am Uther's only son...

93
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:56,416
I want what's mine.

94
00:06:56,417 --> 00:06:57,684
I want to be king.

95
00:06:58,452 --> 00:07:00,587
When you are king... what then?

96
00:07:00,621 --> 00:07:01,522
Well... I...

97
00:07:01,523 --> 00:07:02,523
Whoa... whoa...

98
00:07:02,524 --> 00:07:04,791
What? What is it now?

99
00:07:04,792 --> 00:07:06,593
He has the right-of-way.

100
00:07:08,362 --> 00:07:09,630
You were saying... if you were king...

101
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:12,432
I'd...

102
00:07:12,466 --> 00:07:14,201
do all the things that you taught me.

103
00:07:15,035 --> 00:07:16,803
I'd... build a...

104
00:07:17,304 --> 00:07:18,872
golden city...

105
00:07:20,374 --> 00:07:21,842
devoted to peace...

106
00:07:23,043 --> 00:07:24,444
and charity.

107
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:27,781
What the world needs is...

108
00:07:27,782 --> 00:07:29,449
justice... compassion...

109
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:30,551
more than charity.

110
00:07:31,318 --> 00:07:32,452
Still...

111
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:33,954
Camelot sounds like a dream...

112
00:07:33,955 --> 00:07:36,123
worthy of a king!

113
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,293
Come on, Rupert...

114
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:43,130
Camelot!

115
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:47,801
Camelot...

116
00:07:47,802 --> 00:07:49,803
Come on, Arthur!

117
00:07:58,478 --> 00:07:59,313
All the knights in Britain...

118
00:07:59,314 --> 00:08:00,647
have tried to take it.

119
00:08:00,648 --> 00:08:02,683
But it is the sword of the true king.

120
00:08:02,684 --> 00:08:04,384
It is yours, Arthur!

121
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:13,160
Merlin...

122
00:08:13,161 --> 00:08:15,429
it seems you were here...

123
00:08:15,462 --> 00:08:18,332
only a moment ago.

124
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:19,500
My lord...

125
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:22,002
this man claims Excaliber.

126
00:08:22,003 --> 00:08:23,837
Who is it?

127
00:08:23,838 --> 00:08:26,773
Arthur... only son of Uther...

128
00:08:26,774 --> 00:08:28,709
and rightful king of Britain.

129
00:08:33,447 --> 00:08:36,316
Why give him the sword?

130
00:08:36,717 --> 00:08:38,018
He will betray the people...

131
00:08:38,019 --> 00:08:39,553
just as his father did.

132
00:08:39,953 --> 00:08:41,321
I don't know what I'll do...

133
00:08:41,322 --> 00:08:42,689
or what I'll become...

134
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,192
only what I am.

135
00:08:45,193 --> 00:08:47,594
A wise answer...

136
00:08:47,595 --> 00:08:49,196
I had a wise teacher.

137
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:51,865
You're destroying the old ways.

138
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:54,368
You will be forgotten...

139
00:08:54,369 --> 00:08:55,736
just like the rest of us.

140
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:59,540
That is your fear...

141
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:02,709
not mine, Mab.

142
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:06,346
I... cannot die.

143
00:09:07,548 --> 00:09:12,386
I am a rock of ages.

144
00:09:12,387 --> 00:09:17,224
I will live forever...

145
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:22,729
on the edge of dreams.

146
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:24,798
Take it now, Arthur.

147
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,236
NOW... ARTHUR!

148
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:46,253
The sword is yours!

149
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:58,098
Excaliber!

150
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:02,102
Excaliber...

151
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:04,771
Look at him... Merlin.

152
00:10:04,772 --> 00:10:07,674
His reign begins in blood...

153
00:10:07,675 --> 00:10:11,011
it will end the same way.

154
00:10:11,012 --> 00:10:13,213
No, Mab... you're wrong...

155
00:10:13,214 --> 00:10:15,616
Arthur will heal the land!

156
00:10:15,617 --> 00:10:16,917
He has the sword...

157
00:10:16,918 --> 00:10:19,186
he has Excalibur!

158
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,627
Long live the king!

159
00:10:28,495 --> 00:10:30,631
Don't you ever tidy, Frik?

160
00:10:31,031 --> 00:10:32,466
I try, your majesty...

161
00:10:32,499 --> 00:10:34,134
but I'm terribly overworked.

162
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:37,070
I can't use imps, gnomes, or fairies...

163
00:10:37,071 --> 00:10:38,572
they're utterly useless...

164
00:10:38,573 --> 00:10:39,806
with anything practical.

165
00:10:39,807 --> 00:10:41,842
I mean, I have so much to do!

166
00:10:41,843 --> 00:10:44,077
And you'll have more...

167
00:10:44,078 --> 00:10:46,046
I've totally given up on Merlin...

168
00:10:46,047 --> 00:10:48,782
I thought... perhaps...

169
00:10:48,783 --> 00:10:50,617
despite everything...

170
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:52,920
he might come 'round.

171
00:10:53,821 --> 00:10:55,789
Well, I mean, he's a
stubborn creature, isn't he?

172
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:56,790
I wanted him to...

173
00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:58,392
so I fooled myself.

174
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:02,496
I've never know you to do that before...

175
00:11:02,497 --> 00:11:03,997
over anyone!

176
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:06,333
Enough!

177
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:08,569
Arthur's cursed...

178
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:11,738
I want everyone to know in good time.

179
00:11:11,739 --> 00:11:15,509
And that will be your job... Frik!

180
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:18,111
Uther was my cousin...

181
00:11:18,112 --> 00:11:19,680
I claim the throne by right!

182
00:11:19,713 --> 00:11:21,682
You did not pull the sword...

183
00:11:21,683 --> 00:11:23,250
Excalibur, from the rock!

184
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:25,118
You all failed.

185
00:11:25,119 --> 00:11:28,755
My father is king by right of blood.

186
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,375
That's better... isn't it, my lords?

187
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:50,944
Now you can listen...

188
00:11:50,945 --> 00:11:51,945
instead of fighting.

189
00:11:51,946 --> 00:11:53,347
It should be a novel experience...

190
00:11:53,348 --> 00:11:54,648
for most of you.

191
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:58,552
Uther had a son...

192
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:01,722
I give you... Arthur...

193
00:12:01,723 --> 00:12:03,457
true king of Britain.

194
00:12:05,726 --> 00:12:07,361
Uther had no son!

195
00:12:07,362 --> 00:12:08,462
Everyone knows that...

196
00:12:08,463 --> 00:12:09,530
He did...

197
00:12:10,564 --> 00:12:12,733
Uther did have a son...

198
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:17,237
When Uther conquered Tintagel...

199
00:12:17,238 --> 00:12:19,673
he took the lady, Igraine.

200
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:22,409
A son was born.

201
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:24,077
It's true...

202
00:12:25,746 --> 00:12:27,481
I was there.

203
00:12:28,749 --> 00:12:29,950
Arthur...?

204
00:12:32,586 --> 00:12:34,521
is Uther's son?

205
00:12:34,522 --> 00:12:35,789
If he is...

206
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:38,292
let him draw Excaliber from the stone.

207
00:12:38,293 --> 00:12:39,626
I already have...

208
00:12:39,627 --> 00:12:42,262
Well... prove it!

209
00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:44,264
Prove that it is Excaliber.

210
00:13:12,626 --> 00:13:14,628
You do have Excaliber!

211
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:18,465
You are Uther's son.

212
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:22,302
I acknowledge you...

213
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:24,304
my liege, lord, and king.

214
00:13:27,274 --> 00:13:28,809
And so do I!

215
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:30,644
He has the sword...

216
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:32,312
Accept him... Lot.

217
00:13:32,313 --> 00:13:33,547
Never!

218
00:13:33,548 --> 00:13:35,482
I'll not bend my knee to a boy...

219
00:13:35,483 --> 00:13:36,984
nor will my son.

220
00:13:36,985 --> 00:13:38,485
I can speak for myself, Father.

221
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:40,487
He has Excaliber...

222
00:13:41,155 --> 00:13:42,956
he is the king.

223
00:13:43,657 --> 00:13:44,925
You'll go against your own father...

224
00:13:44,926 --> 00:13:46,527
The cause is just.

225
00:13:46,528 --> 00:13:48,328
And if it's not... and you're wrong?

226
00:13:48,996 --> 00:13:50,831
Then you'll have to kill me in battle.

227
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:54,368
I'm the king's man, Father.

228
00:13:57,571 --> 00:13:59,306
So be it!

229
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,542
My Lords...

230
00:14:02,543 --> 00:14:04,344
hard as it may be for you...

231
00:14:04,845 --> 00:14:06,547
think for a moment.

232
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:09,316
We have seen too many wars.

233
00:14:09,317 --> 00:14:12,186
My mind's made up!

234
00:14:30,037 --> 00:14:31,738
Hello... Morgan.

235
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,209
My... you've grown!

236
00:14:36,043 --> 00:14:36,877
Who are you?

237
00:14:36,878 --> 00:14:37,878
Don't you remember me

238
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:39,046
I used to visit you...

239
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:40,581
when you were very young.

240
00:15:00,067 --> 00:15:01,635
I remember you...

241
00:15:01,969 --> 00:15:03,570
I thought you were a dream.

242
00:15:03,604 --> 00:15:04,571
I'm real!

243
00:15:04,572 --> 00:15:05,572
You lied to me...

244
00:15:05,573 --> 00:15:06,907
you told me you'd make me beautiful...

245
00:15:06,908 --> 00:15:08,242
but you never did.

246
00:15:09,209 --> 00:15:10,844
I told you I'd make you beautiful...

247
00:15:10,845 --> 00:15:12,513
did I?

248
00:15:12,514 --> 00:15:13,580
Then I will!

249
00:15:13,581 --> 00:15:14,915
But first, it's time to put away...

250
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:16,283
childish things.

251
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:19,887
Why so sad?

252
00:15:19,888 --> 00:15:21,655
It's just a toy.

253
00:15:22,723 --> 00:15:24,424
Look at yourself...

254
00:15:31,098 --> 00:15:33,267
I'm beautiful...

255
00:15:33,268 --> 00:15:34,968
Very, very beautiful...

256
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:40,941
I think... clothes cut in the Roman style...

257
00:15:40,942 --> 00:15:42,075
are the only gowns for...

258
00:15:42,076 --> 00:15:43,610
a lady of fashion.

259
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:45,946
Oh... it's wonderful!

260
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:51,285
Now... get me the throne.

261
00:15:51,618 --> 00:15:53,554
That's... beyond my powers.

262
00:16:02,296 --> 00:16:04,131
I'll tell you from personal experience...

263
00:16:04,132 --> 00:16:06,667
that elves are so short...

264
00:16:06,668 --> 00:16:07,868
that when it rains...

265
00:16:08,802 --> 00:16:10,470
they're the last to know.

266
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:16,076
Because of their size...

267
00:16:16,977 --> 00:16:18,111
Frik...

268
00:16:19,046 --> 00:16:20,781
stop enjoying yourself...

269
00:16:20,782 --> 00:16:23,016
and get on with it!

270
00:16:25,152 --> 00:16:26,820
I've been thinking... Morgan...

271
00:16:26,821 --> 00:16:28,755
that there might be...

272
00:16:28,756 --> 00:16:30,791
a way of giving you what you want.

273
00:16:33,994 --> 00:16:36,129
Your son... could be king.

274
00:16:37,498 --> 00:16:38,699
Well, how?

275
00:16:38,832 --> 00:16:40,167
If Arthur defeats Lord Lot...

276
00:16:40,168 --> 00:16:41,835
he'll be king, and I can't marry him.

277
00:16:41,836 --> 00:16:43,237
You don't have to marry him...

278
00:16:43,238 --> 00:16:44,638
to have his son.

279
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:46,073
We have the same mother...

280
00:16:46,074 --> 00:16:47,674
and underneath this charming and...

281
00:16:47,675 --> 00:16:50,177
devilishly handsome exterior...

282
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:53,881
I'm a crabby, old gnome.

283
00:17:03,023 --> 00:17:04,024
Does it matter?

284
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:06,360
Not a bit!

285
00:17:07,394 --> 00:17:08,395
You don't to have to seduce me...

286
00:17:08,396 --> 00:17:09,696
to win me over...

287
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:12,699
like everyone else.

288
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:15,068
I want... the crown.

289
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:18,205
I like you, Morgan Le Fey.

290
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,375
You're a truthful young woman.

291
00:17:22,543 --> 00:17:23,844
And I like you...

292
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:37,724
Stand aside!

293
00:17:39,393 --> 00:17:41,061
The army is all it's ready size...

294
00:17:41,062 --> 00:17:42,896
going to be a bloody fight!

295
00:17:51,572 --> 00:17:53,006
Wait for my signal.

296
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:09,490
He'll be killed!

297
00:18:10,257 --> 00:18:11,325
Merlin!

298
00:18:11,326 --> 00:18:13,427
What the devil does he think he's doing?

299
00:18:35,449 --> 00:18:36,917
There is no reason why men should...

300
00:18:36,918 --> 00:18:38,285
die today, my lord.

301
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:40,454
The quarrel is between us.

302
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:42,256
It is...

303
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:46,293
This is Excalibur...

304
00:18:47,127 --> 00:18:48,829
the sword of the true king.

305
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:51,465
If you believe you have a right to it...

306
00:18:53,467 --> 00:18:54,801
take it...

307
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:04,478
and kill me.

308
00:19:19,493 --> 00:19:21,161
Forgive me, Arthur...

309
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:26,166
I can feel it.

310
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:34,508
The sword is yours.

311
00:19:34,509 --> 00:19:36,343
You are the true king!

312
00:19:40,681 --> 00:19:42,683
The war is over!

313
00:19:50,457 --> 00:19:53,327
Arthur is our true king...

314
00:19:53,328 --> 00:19:56,363
by blood and right.

315
00:20:18,218 --> 00:20:22,055
Here... in this circle...

316
00:20:22,556 --> 00:20:24,558
let us give thanks to our savior...

317
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:26,226
for this deliverance.

318
00:20:26,227 --> 00:20:27,895
And let this circle be a symbol...

319
00:20:27,896 --> 00:20:29,229
of our purpose.

320
00:20:31,565 --> 00:20:33,167
Each man in it...

321
00:20:34,401 --> 00:20:35,869
is equal to the other.

322
00:20:37,237 --> 00:20:38,906
Each has a voice...

323
00:20:40,741 --> 00:20:42,242
and each will strive...

324
00:20:42,243 --> 00:20:44,912
to fight for truth and honour.

325
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:47,581
Let us pray.

326
00:20:51,251 --> 00:20:52,920
I thought I'd finally achieved...

327
00:20:52,921 --> 00:20:55,122
one of my dreams.

328
00:20:55,756 --> 00:20:58,258
At last, there was a good king...

329
00:20:58,259 --> 00:20:59,927
on the throne.

330
00:21:11,939 --> 00:21:14,107
Your Majesty...

331
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:17,311
may I present Lady Marie...

332
00:21:17,444 --> 00:21:18,946
queen of the border Celts...

333
00:21:18,947 --> 00:21:21,281
who comes to pay you homage.

334
00:21:21,282 --> 00:21:23,283
You are most welcome, my Lady.

335
00:21:43,637 --> 00:21:46,073
Lady... we are overwhelmed...

336
00:21:46,074 --> 00:21:47,641
by your gifts.

337
00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:52,246
Perhaps, I... and my servants...

338
00:21:53,313 --> 00:21:55,182
can join you for the night.

339
00:21:55,816 --> 00:21:59,153
We've had a long... tiring journey.

340
00:22:00,587 --> 00:22:02,189
And we'd like to rest...

341
00:22:02,322 --> 00:22:03,991
before we return home.

342
00:22:04,324 --> 00:22:05,659
Of course...

343
00:22:07,494 --> 00:22:09,329
we can spend some time together.

344
00:22:10,931 --> 00:22:11,932
You can...

345
00:22:11,933 --> 00:22:14,668
tell me about... your people.

346
00:22:14,669 --> 00:22:16,170
It will be my pleasure...

347
00:22:17,671 --> 00:22:20,007
your Majesty.

348
00:22:55,375 --> 00:22:57,377
What are you showing me, Mab?

349
00:23:00,047 --> 00:23:01,882
What have you done?

350
00:23:21,902 --> 00:23:23,904
I rode fast that day...

351
00:23:23,905 --> 00:23:26,240
but I knew I was already too late...

352
00:23:26,241 --> 00:23:27,474
to stop something...

353
00:23:27,475 --> 00:23:29,409
that could finish us all.

354
00:23:33,413 --> 00:23:34,915
Out my Lords...

355
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:38,085
OUT!

356
00:23:43,757 --> 00:23:47,094
And close the door behind you.

357
00:23:50,097 --> 00:23:51,932
Merlin... what's the matter?

358
00:23:52,766 --> 00:23:54,134
Tell me the truth, Arthur...

359
00:23:55,936 --> 00:23:56,937
two nights ago you...

360
00:23:56,938 --> 00:23:58,272
slept with a woman.

361
00:23:59,506 --> 00:24:02,276
Yes... if you must know... I did.

362
00:24:03,443 --> 00:24:05,112
'though I don't see why I
need to tell you about it.

363
00:24:05,145 --> 00:24:06,847
That was Morgan Le Fey...

364
00:24:08,782 --> 00:24:10,951
her mother was the Lady Igraine...

365
00:24:10,952 --> 00:24:13,120
your mother!

366
00:24:24,631 --> 00:24:26,133
I didn't know...

367
00:24:28,302 --> 00:24:30,137
I swear I didn't know.

368
00:24:30,138 --> 00:24:31,138
There will be a child.

369
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:34,308
Mab will see to that.

370
00:24:36,643 --> 00:24:38,312
He'll be the future...

371
00:24:38,313 --> 00:24:40,481
and he'll destroy us!

372
00:25:04,905 --> 00:25:06,173
A mirror...

373
00:25:06,174 --> 00:25:08,175
there are no mirrors in Avalon.

374
00:25:30,697 --> 00:25:33,634
You see how it can change you?

375
00:25:33,635 --> 00:25:35,402
You've changed me already...

376
00:25:35,403 --> 00:25:37,371
you've scarred me.

377
00:25:37,372 --> 00:25:39,540
I know... so unfair!

378
00:25:39,541 --> 00:25:41,742
Unfair? That was evil.

379
00:25:43,043 --> 00:25:44,711
With evil all around me...

380
00:25:44,745 --> 00:25:47,714
I can do nothing but evil to survive.

381
00:25:48,415 --> 00:25:51,218
Ohh, that's too easy!

382
00:25:53,554 --> 00:25:56,223
You can fight it... like Merlin.

383
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:58,058
It's because of Merlin...

384
00:25:58,059 --> 00:26:00,060
that all this came about.

385
00:26:00,093 --> 00:26:01,728
That's not true!

386
00:26:01,729 --> 00:26:03,564
Why are you here, Mab?

387
00:26:04,965 --> 00:26:06,233
To make you an offer...

388
00:26:07,301 --> 00:26:08,869
I will restore your beauty...

389
00:26:08,902 --> 00:26:10,637
if you take Merlin...

390
00:26:10,638 --> 00:26:13,006
to a place that I have created for you.

391
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:15,576
You can live with him there...

392
00:26:15,577 --> 00:26:17,578
until the end of your days.

393
00:26:17,579 --> 00:26:19,580
And be happy?

394
00:26:20,514 --> 00:26:23,083
And be happy.

395
00:26:24,017 --> 00:26:25,919
He has a destiny.

396
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,921
It would keep him from his purpose.

397
00:26:27,922 --> 00:26:29,423
It would keep him from...

398
00:26:29,424 --> 00:26:31,358
wasting his life.

399
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:34,595
He believes...

400
00:26:34,596 --> 00:26:36,597
that fighting for what is right...

401
00:26:36,598 --> 00:26:37,998
isn't a waste.

402
00:26:39,433 --> 00:26:41,001
I wouldn't do that to him.

403
00:26:43,103 --> 00:26:44,104
I love him.

404
00:26:44,105 --> 00:26:45,772
- I love him...
- You hate him...

405
00:26:45,773 --> 00:26:47,274
I hate him, too.

406
00:26:47,674 --> 00:26:49,443
What's your answer?

407
00:26:49,444 --> 00:26:50,844
No!

408
00:26:54,448 --> 00:26:56,950
I'm... sorry...

409
00:27:00,454 --> 00:27:02,456
If you change your mind...

410
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:06,627
just... call my name...

411
00:27:06,628 --> 00:27:09,129
out loud.

412
00:27:38,659 --> 00:27:40,661
I couldn't stay away for long.

413
00:27:41,328 --> 00:27:42,496
Arthur was more to me...

414
00:27:42,497 --> 00:27:43,997
than just a king.

415
00:27:44,198 --> 00:27:46,166
And, I was curious

416
00:27:46,167 --> 00:27:48,001
to see what was going on.

417
00:28:00,681 --> 00:28:03,016
Merlin...

418
00:28:04,017 --> 00:28:05,519
it's good to see you, old friend.

419
00:28:06,687 --> 00:28:08,188
What's all this, Arthur?

420
00:28:08,189 --> 00:28:09,690
A promise made flesh.

421
00:28:10,357 --> 00:28:12,025
I'm building the city of Camelot.

422
00:28:13,694 --> 00:28:15,195
It's a new beginning.

423
00:28:16,029 --> 00:28:18,198
I made a mistake that night with Morgan.

424
00:28:18,298 --> 00:28:19,366
But I can't believe that I will be

425
00:28:19,367 --> 00:28:20,868
condemned for all eternity

426
00:28:20,869 --> 00:28:22,202
for one mistake.

427
00:28:22,203 --> 00:28:23,270
Well, not by me.

428
00:28:25,205 --> 00:28:26,707
I'll never condemn you, Arthur.

429
00:28:27,875 --> 00:28:29,543
I'm to marry Lord Leo's daughter.

430
00:28:30,544 --> 00:28:32,379
Ah... do you love her?

431
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:33,981
She'll make a splendid queen...

432
00:28:33,982 --> 00:28:35,215
and be a good wife.

433
00:28:36,884 --> 00:28:38,218
We hope to get married here at Camelot.

434
00:28:38,886 --> 00:28:40,554
It doesn't matter if it's not finished.

435
00:28:40,888 --> 00:28:42,055
Will you be there with me?

436
00:28:42,056 --> 00:28:43,223
I'd be honoured.

437
00:28:43,891 --> 00:28:45,225
What's her name... your bride?

438
00:28:47,227 --> 00:28:48,729
Guinevere.

439
00:29:19,092 --> 00:29:21,595
I was going to Tintagel castle.

440
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:25,265
Perhaps, Arthur wouldn't
have been so eager...

441
00:29:25,266 --> 00:29:28,101
to leave on his quest for the Holy Grail...

442
00:29:29,102 --> 00:29:30,037
if he'd known what a terrible...

443
00:29:30,038 --> 00:29:31,772
enemy he would leave behind...

444
00:29:31,773 --> 00:29:34,274
in Morgan Le Fey.

445
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:37,611
Merlin...

446
00:29:37,644 --> 00:29:39,112
is here to see you, my Lady.

447
00:29:41,782 --> 00:29:42,950
Send him in...

448
00:29:44,751 --> 00:29:46,119
You hear that Mordred?

449
00:29:46,954 --> 00:29:48,455
There's a wizard come to see us.

450
00:29:49,456 --> 00:29:50,624
Won't this be fun?

451
00:29:54,962 --> 00:29:56,296
My Lady Morgan...

452
00:29:56,297 --> 00:29:57,798
do you know why I'm here?

453
00:29:57,799 --> 00:29:59,800
Say hello to my son, Mordred.

454
00:30:00,467 --> 00:30:01,468
Master Mordred...

455
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:04,805
Hmm, that was rude, Mordred.

456
00:30:04,806 --> 00:30:06,006
You can do anything you like... but

457
00:30:06,007 --> 00:30:07,141
you must never be rude.

458
00:30:07,142 --> 00:30:08,475
Rude is being weak.

459
00:30:11,211 --> 00:30:12,479
You were saying, Merlin?

460
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:14,148
Do you know why I'm here?

461
00:30:14,149 --> 00:30:15,983
Hmm, it's to do with my son.

462
00:30:17,317 --> 00:30:18,152
Hasn't he grown?

463
00:30:18,153 --> 00:30:19,153
Yes, he has...

464
00:30:19,154 --> 00:30:20,654
and rather more than is natural...

465
00:30:20,655 --> 00:30:21,822
I have to say.

466
00:30:21,823 --> 00:30:22,990
Hmm, of course...

467
00:30:22,991 --> 00:30:24,324
it's magic!

468
00:30:25,325 --> 00:30:26,360
Morgan...

469
00:30:28,163 --> 00:30:29,163
I beg you for the sake...

470
00:30:29,164 --> 00:30:30,164
of the country...

471
00:30:30,165 --> 00:30:32,733
you must not teach him the old ways.

472
00:30:32,766 --> 00:30:34,668
Oh, this country means nothing to me.

473
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:37,504
A bastard sits on the throne...

474
00:30:37,505 --> 00:30:38,505
that should be mine.

475
00:30:39,006 --> 00:30:41,175
A bastard... begot in blood...

476
00:30:41,176 --> 00:30:42,176
when his father, Uther...

477
00:30:42,177 --> 00:30:44,178
seduced my mother... and killed my father.

478
00:30:44,179 --> 00:30:46,413
It's the future, I'm thinking of, Morgan.

479
00:30:46,414 --> 00:30:48,182
Oh, you would think of the future, Merlin.

480
00:30:48,682 --> 00:30:50,350
because the past is too painful.

481
00:30:51,185 --> 00:30:53,520
You choose Uther to be king.

482
00:30:54,855 --> 00:30:56,857
You helped him seduce my mother...

483
00:30:58,525 --> 00:31:00,861
and destroyed me.

484
00:31:01,028 --> 00:31:01,862
In the end...

485
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:03,030
you...

486
00:31:03,063 --> 00:31:04,364
begot Mordred.

487
00:31:04,431 --> 00:31:05,532
Just as surely...

488
00:31:05,533 --> 00:31:07,701
as Queen Mab, and Arthur.

489
00:31:07,702 --> 00:31:08,702
I know that, but...

490
00:31:08,703 --> 00:31:09,703
I can live with it.

491
00:31:09,704 --> 00:31:12,539
Just as you have to live with the fact...

492
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:14,875
that Mordred will be king.

493
00:31:14,876 --> 00:31:16,210
No... that can never be!

494
00:31:17,411 --> 00:31:18,545
Mordred!

495
00:31:19,046 --> 00:31:20,380
Merlin's a guest.

496
00:31:20,647 --> 00:31:21,882
Don't be naughty.

497
00:31:21,883 --> 00:31:23,383
He just wants attention.

498
00:31:24,218 --> 00:31:25,152
You'll get all you want...

499
00:31:25,352 --> 00:31:27,054
when you're king.

500
00:31:27,387 --> 00:31:28,555
And he will be, Merlin...

501
00:31:28,556 --> 00:31:29,890
he's Arthur's son.

502
00:31:29,891 --> 00:31:32,559
What about the old ways, Morgan?

503
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,560
Well, you're in no position to

504
00:31:33,561 --> 00:31:35,395
lecture me on what I can or can't do.

505
00:31:36,897 --> 00:31:39,399
Besides... the old ways

506
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,734
have been good to me.

507
00:31:41,401 --> 00:31:42,569
They gave me a son...

508
00:31:43,904 --> 00:31:45,405
and made me beautiful.

509
00:31:45,906 --> 00:31:47,241
Oh, poor Morgan...

510
00:31:49,743 --> 00:31:51,245
it's only an illusion.

511
00:31:51,246 --> 00:31:52,412
Beauty is always...

512
00:31:52,579 --> 00:31:54,081
only an illusion, Merlin.

513
00:31:54,748 --> 00:31:56,250
Didn't you know that?

514
00:32:01,588 --> 00:32:02,589
We thought we'd come in...

515
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:03,924
the traditional way...

516
00:32:04,424 --> 00:32:05,926
through the door.

517
00:32:05,927 --> 00:32:08,095
It's traditional to open it, first.

518
00:32:08,595 --> 00:32:10,264
Mordred! Look who's here!

519
00:32:10,265 --> 00:32:12,266
Your Auntie Mab, and Uncle Frik!

520
00:32:13,801 --> 00:32:16,103
It's been ages, Master Merlin...

521
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:18,105
Do you ever think of the old school...

522
00:32:18,106 --> 00:32:19,106
where I tried to teach you the...

523
00:32:19,107 --> 00:32:20,607
fundamentals of magic?

524
00:32:20,941 --> 00:32:22,776
He could have been my star pupil, Morgan...

525
00:32:22,777 --> 00:32:23,777
but he proved...

526
00:32:23,778 --> 00:32:25,612
disappointing.

527
00:32:25,613 --> 00:32:26,880
But you won't...

528
00:32:26,881 --> 00:32:27,948
will you, Mordred?

529
00:32:27,949 --> 00:32:28,949
Isn't he handsome?

530
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:30,450
Handsome is as handsome does.

531
00:32:31,118 --> 00:32:32,286
What does that mean?

532
00:32:32,287 --> 00:32:34,454
I've never really understood the phrase...

533
00:32:34,455 --> 00:32:35,455
Toys... Mordred...

534
00:32:36,957 --> 00:32:37,958
Auntie always brings you

535
00:32:37,959 --> 00:32:40,461
lots of lovely toys.

536
00:32:44,631 --> 00:32:45,632
You see, Merlin...

537
00:32:45,966 --> 00:32:47,801
you took my family away from me...

538
00:32:47,802 --> 00:32:49,803
now... I have a new one.

539
00:32:49,804 --> 00:32:51,805
It won't last, Morgan...

540
00:32:51,806 --> 00:32:53,474
Nothing does...

541
00:32:53,475 --> 00:32:55,642
Can't you see it... feel it?

542
00:32:55,643 --> 00:32:57,978
I'm winning, Merlin.

543
00:32:57,979 --> 00:33:01,315
I have the precious gift of patience.

544
00:33:02,149 --> 00:33:04,985
It'll be years before Mordred
can claim the throne...

545
00:33:04,986 --> 00:33:06,653
but I can wait.

546
00:33:06,654 --> 00:33:08,655
Time means nothing to me.

547
00:33:12,493 --> 00:33:14,027
You'll be the death of Arthur...

548
00:33:14,028 --> 00:33:16,997
and the end of all poor Merlin's dreams.

549
00:33:16,998 --> 00:33:19,333
Won't you, my sweetie?

550
00:33:19,334 --> 00:33:20,334
Oh! Look!

551
00:33:21,168 --> 00:33:23,003
The big, bad wizard can't do a thing!

552
00:33:24,671 --> 00:33:28,675
Run... run wizard!

553
00:33:47,694 --> 00:33:50,364
Merlin... you're troubled again.

554
00:33:51,865 --> 00:33:54,201
Still the same cry for help, Lady.

555
00:33:54,535 --> 00:33:56,870
You're sister, Mab, grows more powerful.

556
00:33:56,871 --> 00:33:59,373
And I grow weaker...

557
00:34:00,374 --> 00:34:01,375
What can I do? I...

558
00:34:02,709 --> 00:34:04,711
I have to find a man to guard the throne...

559
00:34:04,712 --> 00:34:06,046
while Arthur goes questing...

560
00:34:06,047 --> 00:34:07,214
for the Holy Grail.

561
00:34:08,715 --> 00:34:09,550
The temptation will be to

562
00:34:09,551 --> 00:34:11,051
seize the crown when he's gone.

563
00:34:11,052 --> 00:34:15,055
You need a man pure in heart.

564
00:34:15,056 --> 00:34:16,390
I've tried to find him before...

565
00:34:16,391 --> 00:34:17,558
he doesn't exist.

566
00:34:17,559 --> 00:34:21,595
The answer is at Joyous Guarde.

567
00:34:21,596 --> 00:34:25,566
My ship will take you.

568
00:34:31,238 --> 00:34:32,406
It was like a dream.

569
00:34:32,407 --> 00:34:34,808
A dream of a dream...

570
00:34:34,809 --> 00:34:37,411
the skies parted and I saw the dream

571
00:34:38,613 --> 00:34:40,147
come alive, before my eyes.

572
00:34:41,248 --> 00:34:42,749
That was...

573
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:44,351
someday, they'll describe me,

574
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:46,053
Arthur, Guinevere, and Camelot

575
00:34:46,054 --> 00:34:47,754
as a dream.

576
00:34:49,256 --> 00:34:50,257
Who are you?

577
00:34:50,924 --> 00:34:52,593
I am Merlin, the wizard.

578
00:34:52,594 --> 00:34:55,095
There aren't any wizards left.

579
00:34:55,762 --> 00:34:57,431
I'm the last of them.

580
00:34:58,432 --> 00:34:59,433
Who are you?

581
00:34:59,434 --> 00:35:00,434
Galahad...

582
00:35:00,435 --> 00:35:02,269
My mother is the Lady Elaine...

583
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:04,138
and my father is Sir Launcelot.

584
00:35:04,938 --> 00:35:06,306
I've come here to find a man

585
00:35:06,307 --> 00:35:09,109
to defend King Arthur, and his kingdom.

586
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:10,310
But he must be a good man...

587
00:35:10,311 --> 00:35:12,779
pure in heart.

588
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:13,981
You've found him.

589
00:35:16,283 --> 00:35:18,986
It was all... too easy.

590
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,622
You're sure this is what you want?

591
00:35:22,689 --> 00:35:23,791
It's not what I want...

592
00:35:24,625 --> 00:35:25,959
it's what you want.

593
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:28,128
I can't hold you back.

594
00:35:28,129 --> 00:35:30,798
It's your chance for
one last great adventure.

595
00:35:32,132 --> 00:35:33,467
I should have known.

596
00:35:33,468 --> 00:35:34,535
Galahad...

597
00:35:34,568 --> 00:35:37,070
protect your mother while I'm away.

598
00:35:48,148 --> 00:35:52,152
My Lords, Ladies, Knights of the realm...

599
00:35:53,487 --> 00:35:55,289
I shall leave soon, on a God-given

600
00:35:55,290 --> 00:35:56,990
quest for the Holy Grail.

601
00:35:57,558 --> 00:35:58,826
Now, I seek a champion...

602
00:35:58,827 --> 00:36:00,494
to protect our country, and

603
00:36:00,527 --> 00:36:01,962
the honour of our fair queen

604
00:36:01,963 --> 00:36:03,197
while I'm gone.

605
00:36:03,497 --> 00:36:04,832
I claim that honour, Sire.

606
00:36:05,666 --> 00:36:08,335
Gawaine, I hope that you don't win...

607
00:36:08,336 --> 00:36:09,837
you know I need you to come with me.

608
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:11,171
You should have let me compete

609
00:36:11,172 --> 00:36:12,172
in the tourney, Sire.

610
00:36:12,173 --> 00:36:14,508
You're too old, Sir Boris.

611
00:36:14,509 --> 00:36:15,509
Of course, he's too old...

612
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:16,844
but I'm not.

613
00:36:18,345 --> 00:36:19,913
Your Majesty...

614
00:36:21,348 --> 00:36:22,182
I wish to vouch for

615
00:36:22,183 --> 00:36:23,717
Sir Launcelot of the Lake.

616
00:36:24,184 --> 00:36:25,686
He wants to enter the jousts.

617
00:36:26,687 --> 00:36:27,855
So be it, Merlin.

618
00:37:22,576 --> 00:37:25,245
Aha! Gawaine, or this Launcelot!

619
00:37:53,607 --> 00:37:54,808
Launcelot of the Lake...

620
00:37:54,809 --> 00:37:56,510
takes the honours...

621
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:58,111
He is the best...

622
00:37:58,112 --> 00:38:00,280
and the noblest of the knights.

623
00:38:05,619 --> 00:38:08,122
He's very handsome... isn't he?

624
00:38:08,789 --> 00:38:09,957
Yes...

625
00:38:11,792 --> 00:38:12,860
What did you say, my Lady?

626
00:38:12,903 --> 00:38:14,995
Nothing...

627
00:38:15,629 --> 00:38:16,997
Your Majesty?

628
00:38:16,998 --> 00:38:18,632
I offer you my sword...

629
00:38:18,633 --> 00:38:19,867
and my life.

630
00:38:19,868 --> 00:38:21,235
It is an honour, brave knight.

631
00:38:21,236 --> 00:38:22,236
As champion, Launcelot shall be

632
00:38:40,053 --> 00:38:41,255
How is he?

633
00:38:41,989 --> 00:38:44,191
Fair to middling, considering we haven't

634
00:38:44,192 --> 00:38:45,793
taken the lance out, yet.

635
00:38:45,794 --> 00:38:46,927
And why not?

636
00:38:46,928 --> 00:38:48,228
There is a dispute... uh...

637
00:38:48,229 --> 00:38:49,530
scholarly dispute...

638
00:38:49,531 --> 00:38:50,531
as to whether we take it out

639
00:38:50,532 --> 00:38:52,533
con or contra wise.

640
00:38:52,534 --> 00:38:53,867
Which means, to the mere layman,

641
00:38:53,868 --> 00:38:55,836
turning and pulling it to the left...

642
00:38:55,869 --> 00:38:57,771
or to the right... contra.

643
00:38:57,772 --> 00:39:00,040
Is there anything I can
do for you, Sir Launcelot?

644
00:39:01,175 --> 00:39:02,843
Hold my hand, Lady.

645
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:05,312
No, Tannen, pull conwise...

646
00:39:05,313 --> 00:39:07,214
the planets of Venus, and Uranus

647
00:39:07,215 --> 00:39:09,016
will be the dominant influences.

648
00:39:09,017 --> 00:39:10,918
You're physicians... instead of arguing...

649
00:39:10,919 --> 00:39:12,219
about it... do it!

650
00:39:13,187 --> 00:39:15,355
We must talk about it first.

651
00:39:15,356 --> 00:39:17,825
Indeed... these are weighty matters...

652
00:39:17,826 --> 00:39:19,393
fit only for experts.

653
00:39:19,394 --> 00:39:20,427
Trust us...

654
00:39:20,428 --> 00:39:22,396
if we treat a knight for a broken arm...

655
00:39:22,429 --> 00:39:24,465
that is what he'll die of.

656
00:39:24,466 --> 00:39:26,033
That's enough... enough!

657
00:39:30,037 --> 00:39:33,207
Launcelot? Are you ready, Sir Knight?

658
00:39:37,211 --> 00:39:39,480
Do it... Gawaine.

659
00:40:16,817 --> 00:40:17,951
Goodbye, Merlin.

660
00:40:18,418 --> 00:40:21,221
'Bye, Arthur... come back to us.

661
00:40:22,422 --> 00:40:24,424
They left to chase dreams...

662
00:40:24,458 --> 00:40:26,960
shadows...

663
00:40:26,994 --> 00:40:27,961
but if I'd told them...

664
00:40:28,128 --> 00:40:29,930
they wouldn't have listened.

665
00:40:31,765 --> 00:40:33,934
And so, the years rolled on...

666
00:40:34,601 --> 00:40:36,436
one year merging into another...

667
00:40:37,838 --> 00:40:39,406
and another.

668
00:40:41,508 --> 00:40:43,977
If you five gentlemen
don't stop trembling...

669
00:40:43,978 --> 00:40:45,979
I might miss, and kill you all.

670
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:55,889
Less than perfect.

671
00:41:03,297 --> 00:41:04,932
That's enough, Mordred.

672
00:41:09,136 --> 00:41:11,472
You mustn’t get carried away, my sweet.

673
00:41:11,805 --> 00:41:14,274
It shows lack of control.

674
00:41:14,275 --> 00:41:16,143
Why fire at Auntie Mab, and Uncle Frik?

675
00:41:16,777 --> 00:41:18,278
I do hope that the boy...

676
00:41:18,312 --> 00:41:19,146
is just having fun,

677
00:41:19,213 --> 00:41:20,814
and it's nothing personal.

678
00:41:20,815 --> 00:41:23,016
It's not personal... he likes you.

679
00:41:23,017 --> 00:41:24,218
I often wonder what he would do

680
00:41:24,251 --> 00:41:25,652
if he didn't like me.

681
00:41:25,653 --> 00:41:27,020
Stop fussing, Mother!

682
00:41:27,321 --> 00:41:28,589
Auntie Mab understands...

683
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:29,823
don't you, Auntie Mab?

684
00:41:29,824 --> 00:41:31,825
Of course, I understand...

685
00:41:31,826 --> 00:41:32,826
you were testing yourself.

686
00:41:33,494 --> 00:41:35,496
Now, come and sit by me.

687
00:41:41,835 --> 00:41:44,338
You know you're my favourite, Mordred...

688
00:41:44,339 --> 00:41:46,840
but you have to channel your aggression.

689
00:41:46,841 --> 00:41:48,008
Against Arthur...

690
00:41:48,009 --> 00:41:50,344
Yes... always Arthur...

691
00:41:50,345 --> 00:41:51,812
and Merlin.

692
00:41:52,346 --> 00:41:54,047
You're looking pale, Mordred.

693
00:41:54,715 --> 00:41:57,184
You're not eating enough.

694
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:05,559
I already have the strength of ten men.

695
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:07,861
Listen to your aunt...

696
00:42:08,195 --> 00:42:10,030
Please do something about your hair.

697
00:42:12,533 --> 00:42:15,202
Very well, Mother.

698
00:42:16,537 --> 00:42:18,372
There's a good boy.

699
00:42:23,744 --> 00:42:25,979
The work is going much too slowly.

700
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:27,614
but you keep on changing
your mind,

701
00:42:27,648 --> 00:42:29,049
Sir Launcelot.

702
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:30,517
First this, then that...

703
00:42:30,518 --> 00:42:33,420
I'm giving it my best try!

704
00:42:33,421 --> 00:42:35,589
Well, you've got to do better than that.

705
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:38,425
How can I do better than my best?

706
00:42:40,994 --> 00:42:42,396
All alone, my Lady?

707
00:42:42,397 --> 00:42:44,431
Merlin is my faithful shadow.

708
00:42:45,632 --> 00:42:47,367
That's right, and proper.

709
00:42:47,368 --> 00:42:48,869
Why not you?

710
00:42:49,736 --> 00:42:51,071
You're my champion.

711
00:42:51,572 --> 00:42:53,740
Because when I'm near you,
I can't control my heart.

712
00:42:54,741 --> 00:42:55,943
You're near me now.

713
00:42:56,577 --> 00:42:58,078
It's dangerous...

714
00:42:58,579 --> 00:43:03,350
- My Lady...? My Lady...?
- Yes...

715
00:43:04,918 --> 00:43:07,654
Perhaps, we should be
grateful for my shadow.

716
00:43:25,439 --> 00:43:26,840
What's wrong, Merlin?

717
00:43:26,841 --> 00:43:29,543
The walls are whispering, Guinevere.

718
00:43:30,944 --> 00:43:32,813
Can't you hear them?

719
00:43:35,282 --> 00:43:37,618
No...

720
00:43:37,951 --> 00:43:39,586
What are they saying?

721
00:43:39,587 --> 00:43:42,489
That you are too friendly
with Sir Launcelot.

722
00:43:44,291 --> 00:43:46,326
Do you believe such whispers, Merlin?

723
00:43:46,327 --> 00:43:49,129
Ah, but I've seen how you
two look at each other.

724
00:43:49,963 --> 00:43:52,366
I don't care what others think.

725
00:43:52,367 --> 00:43:54,635
I'm a queen!

726
00:43:54,636 --> 00:43:56,937
That is why you must take special care...

727
00:43:56,938 --> 00:43:59,506
I can't protect you in this matter.

728
00:44:25,332 --> 00:44:27,801
You look... beautiful...

729
00:44:35,342 --> 00:44:37,177
I should jump...

730
00:44:37,178 --> 00:44:39,012
throw myself from the battlement.

731
00:44:39,013 --> 00:44:40,447
Then I'll jump, too...

732
00:44:42,683 --> 00:44:44,785
I can't live without you.

733
00:45:18,385 --> 00:45:20,387
I don't believe it!

734
00:45:20,487 --> 00:45:22,523
Launcelot wouldn't...

735
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:47,915
Auntie...

736
00:45:47,916 --> 00:45:50,751
you're looking extraordinarily
pleased with yourself.

737
00:45:52,619 --> 00:45:54,154
What have you done?

738
00:45:55,088 --> 00:45:56,690
Is it terrible?

739
00:45:57,758 --> 00:45:59,259
Do tell...

740
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:01,295
I'm sure it's perfect.

741
00:46:02,529 --> 00:46:04,064
I've made sure...

742
00:46:04,065 --> 00:46:06,366
Elaine knows that Launcelot...

743
00:46:06,367 --> 00:46:09,603
and Guinevere are lovers.

744
00:46:10,270 --> 00:46:13,440
How absolutely delicious!

745
00:46:15,109 --> 00:46:16,310
Isn't that...

746
00:46:16,311 --> 00:46:19,113
rather unworthy of us?

747
00:46:19,114 --> 00:46:20,481
Unworthy?

748
00:46:21,281 --> 00:46:22,950
Well, what does that mean, Mother?

749
00:46:24,785 --> 00:46:26,286
Ohh, I've forgotten...

750
00:46:26,287 --> 00:46:27,421
what does it mean?

751
00:46:27,454 --> 00:46:30,190
Yes... it is unworthy...

752
00:46:32,559 --> 00:46:36,296
but I don't like to be told, Frik.

753
00:46:41,969 --> 00:46:44,471
Frik...

754
00:46:52,312 --> 00:46:54,314
I warned you...

755
00:46:54,315 --> 00:46:56,683
you didn't listen.

756
00:46:57,751 --> 00:46:59,486
What's happened?

757
00:47:18,505 --> 00:47:20,441
Elaine...

758
00:47:21,108 --> 00:47:22,843
How did she die?

759
00:47:24,511 --> 00:47:26,680
She died of a broken heart...

760
00:47:28,515 --> 00:47:30,684
because of you.

761
00:47:42,529 --> 00:47:43,997
I'm sorry...

762
00:47:50,537 --> 00:47:53,207
I judged them too harshly.

763
00:47:54,041 --> 00:47:55,976
The blame was mine, too.

764
00:47:55,977 --> 00:47:58,712
I picked Launcelot, after all.

765
00:48:00,314 --> 00:48:02,883
I wish I'd told them that.

766
00:48:02,884 --> 00:48:04,885
It might have made it easier.

767
00:48:09,723 --> 00:48:11,225
Oh, great news...

768
00:48:11,226 --> 00:48:13,227
great news, Nimue!

769
00:48:13,228 --> 00:48:15,729
Arthur's coming home!

770
00:48:15,730 --> 00:48:17,364
Oh, thank God!

771
00:48:17,365 --> 00:48:18,732
Did he find the Holy Grail?

772
00:48:18,733 --> 00:48:19,900
No... but what of it?

773
00:48:19,901 --> 00:48:21,568
He's coming home.

774
00:48:21,569 --> 00:48:23,570
Holy Grail, or no Holy Grail...

775
00:48:23,571 --> 00:48:25,405
he should never have left.

776
00:48:25,472 --> 00:48:26,473
Merlin... he's free...

777
00:48:26,474 --> 00:48:28,909
he can start living his own life again.

778
00:48:28,910 --> 00:48:32,746
Yes... and it should be with you, my child.

779
00:48:33,747 --> 00:48:36,416
Your true vocation is Merlin.

780
00:48:37,584 --> 00:48:39,753
God doesn't want you when you love another.

781
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:44,091
Umm... I... I shouldn't really say this...

782
00:48:44,092 --> 00:48:45,793
in these hallowed walls.

783
00:48:45,794 --> 00:48:48,095
Faith is supreme, of course...

784
00:48:48,762 --> 00:48:52,432
but love is even better.

785
00:48:55,269 --> 00:48:56,603
Careful, my dear...

786
00:48:57,104 --> 00:48:58,939
these steps are very slippery.

787
00:48:58,940 --> 00:48:59,940
where are we going?

788
00:48:59,941 --> 00:49:01,275
To my land...

789
00:49:01,276 --> 00:49:03,110
the land of magic.

790
00:49:03,111 --> 00:49:04,611
Can I create monsters?

791
00:49:04,612 --> 00:49:06,213
Ohh, if you wish.

792
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:08,115
You're so good to me, Auntie.

793
00:49:08,116 --> 00:49:09,950
It won't all be fun, and games...

794
00:49:09,951 --> 00:49:11,685
Arthur's coming back.

795
00:49:11,686 --> 00:49:13,620
There will be things I have to teach you...

796
00:49:14,455 --> 00:49:15,622
Is Mother coming?

797
00:49:15,623 --> 00:49:17,724
No, we don't need her, anymore.

798
00:49:17,725 --> 00:49:20,060
Mab... where are you taking my son?

799
00:49:20,061 --> 00:49:21,628
It's time...

800
00:49:21,629 --> 00:49:22,629
without a word...?

801
00:49:23,297 --> 00:49:24,298
without a by-your-leave?

802
00:49:24,299 --> 00:49:25,732
I have to make him ready.

803
00:49:25,733 --> 00:49:26,800
You're not taking him!

804
00:49:26,801 --> 00:49:27,801
He's my son...

805
00:49:27,802 --> 00:49:28,802
He's mine!

806
00:49:28,803 --> 00:49:29,803
I gave him love...

807
00:49:29,804 --> 00:49:31,038
you gave him toys!

808
00:49:31,039 --> 00:49:33,807
I gave him life!

809
00:49:33,808 --> 00:49:35,309
I'm never letting him go.

810
00:49:40,647 --> 00:49:41,815
No!

811
00:49:44,751 --> 00:49:46,487
That was very clever, Auntie.

812
00:49:50,824 --> 00:49:51,825
My love...

813
00:49:52,993 --> 00:49:54,194
My love...

814
00:49:58,565 --> 00:49:59,800
Frik...?

815
00:50:00,334 --> 00:50:01,335
My love...?

816
00:50:03,003 --> 00:50:05,239
Am I still beautiful?

817
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:08,742
Beyond words, my love...

818
00:50:11,345 --> 00:50:12,713
Am I?

819
00:50:12,714 --> 00:50:14,782
Oh... yes...

820
00:50:16,483 --> 00:50:18,252
beyond words.

821
00:50:32,866 --> 00:50:34,201
You killed her!

822
00:50:34,202 --> 00:50:36,203
Perhaps, she just slipped.

823
00:50:36,204 --> 00:50:38,038
In any case, what does it matter?

824
00:50:38,039 --> 00:50:39,473
You're holding us up, Frik.

825
00:50:39,474 --> 00:50:40,707
We have a lot to do!

826
00:50:40,708 --> 00:50:42,543
Mab! You evil, old crone!

827
00:50:42,544 --> 00:50:44,812
May God have mercy on your soul!

828
00:50:44,813 --> 00:50:47,381
He obviously didn't have
any on the rest of you!

829
00:50:47,382 --> 00:50:49,416
Why is everybody suddenly against me?

830
00:50:50,384 --> 00:50:51,552
Frik!

831
00:50:51,553 --> 00:50:52,820
I'm leaving you...

832
00:50:52,821 --> 00:50:54,588
with your misery, and pain...

833
00:50:55,155 --> 00:50:57,724
but... with no more magic powers!

834
00:50:58,659 --> 00:51:01,061
Now... you will wander through the world...

835
00:51:01,395 --> 00:51:03,664
ugly and alone...

836
00:51:03,997 --> 00:51:06,567
just as if you were human.

837
00:51:06,568 --> 00:51:08,602
Goodbye, Frik... I'll miss you...

838
00:51:09,570 --> 00:51:11,405
No, I won't!

839
00:51:14,575 --> 00:51:16,410
Why didn’t you kill him, Auntie Mab?

840
00:51:16,411 --> 00:51:19,613
Because, that's what he wanted me to do.

841
00:51:42,102 --> 00:51:43,537
Camelot!

842
00:51:43,538 --> 00:51:45,105
It's built!

843
00:51:45,106 --> 00:51:46,940
Sir Launcelot has kept his word.

844
00:51:48,776 --> 00:51:51,445
We have to ride in with
our banners held high, Sire.

845
00:51:51,446 --> 00:51:52,780
You're right, Gawaine...

846
00:51:53,947 --> 00:51:56,617
Raise your banners, and your hearts, men!

847
00:51:56,618 --> 00:51:58,786
We're home!

848
00:52:15,302 --> 00:52:16,637
Where is everyone?

849
00:52:16,638 --> 00:52:18,305
Something's wrong, Sire.

850
00:52:26,647 --> 00:52:28,148
What's wrong here?

851
00:52:40,828 --> 00:52:41,995
Guinevere...

852
00:52:47,501 --> 00:52:49,336
Where is Merlin?

853
00:52:50,003 --> 00:52:51,672
Where's Launcelot?

854
00:52:51,673 --> 00:52:53,674
I'll tell you...

855
00:52:57,177 --> 00:52:58,846
Who the devil are you?

856
00:52:58,847 --> 00:53:01,181
Elegantly put...

857
00:53:01,182 --> 00:53:02,349
who the devil...

858
00:53:03,350 --> 00:53:04,852
yes, indeed.

859
00:53:05,619 --> 00:53:07,187
Who the devil...

860
00:53:08,021 --> 00:53:09,356
Well, don't you recognize me?

861
00:53:09,357 --> 00:53:10,357
No...

862
00:53:10,858 --> 00:53:12,392
should I?

863
00:53:12,393 --> 00:53:14,695
Ohh... I'm hurt!

864
00:53:15,262 --> 00:53:18,065
here... in my heart...

865
00:53:18,066 --> 00:53:21,034
not usually my most vulnerable spot.

866
00:53:22,269 --> 00:53:24,037
I recognize you...

867
00:53:24,038 --> 00:53:25,372
Father!

868
00:53:25,873 --> 00:53:29,209
I'm your long lost son, Mordred.

869
00:53:31,145 --> 00:53:34,548
Morgan Le Fey... is your mother.

870
00:53:34,549 --> 00:53:37,217
Not is, Father... was...

871
00:53:38,051 --> 00:53:40,554
she passed over into a better world.

872
00:53:41,889 --> 00:53:43,724
And she sleeps alone, at last.

873
00:53:44,458 --> 00:53:45,726
A great loss...

874
00:53:45,727 --> 00:53:48,061
one day, she was laughing, smiling...

875
00:53:48,062 --> 00:53:49,396
the next... gone!

876
00:53:49,397 --> 00:53:51,064
like a summer's breeze.

877
00:53:51,065 --> 00:53:54,568
In the midst of life, etc.
etc. and so on, and so forth.

878
00:53:55,569 --> 00:53:56,737
It's why I'm here...

879
00:53:57,070 --> 00:53:58,739
I don't understand...

880
00:53:58,740 --> 00:54:00,908
to protect your interests, Father.

881
00:54:00,909 --> 00:54:03,911
You see, your interests are my interests.

882
00:54:04,244 --> 00:54:05,913
Whilst you were away on this

883
00:54:05,914 --> 00:54:07,281
great spiritual quest...

884
00:54:07,282 --> 00:54:08,849
to cleanse your soul...

885
00:54:08,850 --> 00:54:10,918
How should I put it...?

886
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:13,921
you were being betrayed...

887
00:54:13,922 --> 00:54:14,922
MORDRED!

888
00:54:16,757 --> 00:54:18,592
- That's enough!
- It isn't!

889
00:54:18,593 --> 00:54:19,593
So, come Merlin...

890
00:54:19,626 --> 00:54:20,627
let's speak the truth, at last...

891
00:54:20,661 --> 00:54:22,763
farces in the time...

892
00:54:23,530 --> 00:54:26,433
Father... Launcelot
betrayed you with the queen.

893
00:54:26,434 --> 00:54:28,001
- What?
- or should it be...?

894
00:54:28,002 --> 00:54:30,270
the queen betrayed you with Launcelot?

895
00:54:30,271 --> 00:54:32,272
No pretense... no point being pedantic...

896
00:54:32,273 --> 00:54:33,607
You were betrayed!

897
00:54:33,608 --> 00:54:34,341
Guinevere?

898
00:54:34,374 --> 00:54:35,776
This isn't the place to discuss this matter.

899
00:54:35,943 --> 00:54:38,612
Oh... I think it's the perfect place.

900
00:54:39,279 --> 00:54:40,280
Is it true?

901
00:54:40,281 --> 00:54:42,449
Arthur, you have just returned...

902
00:54:42,450 --> 00:54:44,118
we must talk calmly.

903
00:54:44,119 --> 00:54:46,120
- Guinevere, is it true?
- Yes, it's true!

904
00:54:46,121 --> 00:54:47,287
Mordred, you have no right to be here.

905
00:54:47,288 --> 00:54:48,889
I have every right to be here.

906
00:54:48,890 --> 00:54:50,858
We all have. This isn't a private matter

907
00:54:50,859 --> 00:54:52,126
it concerns us all.

908
00:54:52,127 --> 00:54:53,460
How could you do that to me?

909
00:54:53,627 --> 00:54:55,629
Didn't you think of me at all?

910
00:54:55,630 --> 00:54:56,630
You left me alone for years...

911
00:54:56,631 --> 00:54:57,831
did you not think of me?

912
00:54:57,832 --> 00:54:58,966
What of my honour...

913
00:54:58,967 --> 00:55:00,768
finding out my husband had a child...

914
00:55:00,769 --> 00:55:02,302
by a woman named Morgan Le Fey?

915
00:55:02,303 --> 00:55:03,704
Good one...

916
00:55:03,705 --> 00:55:04,938
Oh, come, Father...

917
00:55:04,939 --> 00:55:07,341
this is becoming distressingly personal.

918
00:55:07,342 --> 00:55:08,542
When you're forgetting...

919
00:55:08,543 --> 00:55:09,543
it's a matter of state.

920
00:55:09,544 --> 00:55:10,811
Matter of state...!

921
00:55:10,812 --> 00:55:12,646
We are talking treason here...

922
00:55:14,648 --> 00:55:16,083
My Lords...

923
00:55:21,989 --> 00:55:24,057
I don't see it as treason...

924
00:55:25,159 --> 00:55:26,493
She betrayed me...

925
00:55:27,161 --> 00:55:28,762
and only me.

926
00:55:30,063 --> 00:55:30,998
That's enough.

927
00:55:30,999 --> 00:55:33,734
- No!
- Sire, Mordred is right...

928
00:55:33,735 --> 00:55:34,735
you are the king...

929
00:55:34,736 --> 00:55:37,004
and that makes her adultery treason.

930
00:55:37,005 --> 00:55:38,672
Then we must condemn her to death!

931
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:40,340
Do you really think we should do that?

932
00:55:40,341 --> 00:55:41,408
- It's the law!
- It's harsh...

933
00:55:41,409 --> 00:55:43,010
It's meant to be.

934
00:55:43,011 --> 00:55:44,778
My Lords...

935
00:55:45,179 --> 00:55:46,480
This is a time when we should...

936
00:55:46,481 --> 00:55:48,515
temper justice with mercy.

937
00:55:48,516 --> 00:55:49,683
After all...

938
00:55:49,684 --> 00:55:51,685
your religion proclaims it.

939
00:55:51,686 --> 00:55:53,754
Let he who is not guilty of sin...

940
00:55:53,755 --> 00:55:55,522
cast the first stone.

941
00:55:55,523 --> 00:55:58,025
Now... I know I have been guilty

942
00:55:58,026 --> 00:55:59,359
in my time. and I suspect that...

943
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:00,694
you have been, too.

944
00:56:00,695 --> 00:56:02,296
I must confess...

945
00:56:02,297 --> 00:56:04,698
I have sinned a little.

946
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:08,969
So... we make excuses for
her, because she's a queen.

947
00:56:08,970 --> 00:56:11,371
Because she is human.

948
00:56:11,372 --> 00:56:14,041
No... because she is Arthur's wife!

949
00:56:15,542 --> 00:56:16,844
Are we going back to one law for

950
00:56:16,845 --> 00:56:18,545
the rulers, and one for the ruled?

951
00:56:19,213 --> 00:56:20,380
Is that the way it is?

952
00:56:21,248 --> 00:56:22,716
Arthur?

953
00:56:22,717 --> 00:56:24,718
I thought Camelot was to be different.

954
00:56:25,886 --> 00:56:26,887
It is...

955
00:56:26,888 --> 00:56:29,223
Then, show the world you mean it!

956
00:56:40,567 --> 00:56:41,869
Merlin...

957
00:56:42,736 --> 00:56:44,238
What should I do?

958
00:56:45,239 --> 00:56:46,573
In the end...

959
00:56:46,574 --> 00:56:49,409
you must uphold the law.

960
00:57:01,922 --> 00:57:05,759
Guinevere... will be tried for treason.

961
00:57:11,698 --> 00:57:13,267
A splendid decision...

962
00:57:13,268 --> 00:57:16,103
both fair, and just, eh, Father?

963
00:57:16,104 --> 00:57:18,305
Now! Let's drink and enjoy ourselves

964
00:57:18,306 --> 00:57:20,607
I want you out of Camelot!

965
00:57:20,608 --> 00:57:23,277
But Father, I've only just arrived.

966
00:57:23,777 --> 00:57:24,945
I thought we could reminisce about

967
00:57:24,946 --> 00:57:26,947
old times, and play happy families.

968
00:57:26,948 --> 00:57:27,948
Stop him talking!

969
00:57:27,949 --> 00:57:29,783
You can't mean that, Father.

970
00:57:30,184 --> 00:57:31,185
I'm your beloved son...

971
00:57:31,186 --> 00:57:32,619
the crown prince,

972
00:57:32,620 --> 00:57:34,121
your one and only heir.

973
00:57:34,122 --> 00:57:35,289
I want you out of my sight.

974
00:57:35,290 --> 00:57:37,791
- Embrace me, Father...
- Never!

975
00:57:37,792 --> 00:57:39,626
or I'll take what's rightfully mine.

976
00:57:39,627 --> 00:57:41,795
Guards! Seize him!

977
00:57:44,798 --> 00:57:46,133
Don't get up...

978
00:57:46,134 --> 00:57:47,634
I know my way out.

979
00:57:50,270 --> 00:57:51,271
I'm sorry, Father...

980
00:57:51,272 --> 00:57:53,307
but I'm going to destroy you.

981
00:57:53,308 --> 00:57:55,809
And this time, you pet
wizard won't save you.

982
00:58:09,823 --> 00:58:11,825
Mab...

983
00:58:16,930 --> 00:58:19,099
I'm here, Nimue.

984
00:58:22,836 --> 00:58:24,872
You made me a promise, years ago...

985
00:58:24,873 --> 00:58:26,840
will you keep it?

986
00:58:28,342 --> 00:58:30,010
Yes...

987
00:58:31,678 --> 00:58:33,514
What made you change your mind?

988
00:58:34,414 --> 00:58:35,716
The king is coming home...

989
00:58:35,916 --> 00:58:38,352
Merlin is free to be with me.

990
00:58:39,186 --> 00:58:41,688
I've discovered all I want is Merlin.

991
00:58:45,459 --> 00:58:46,460
Will you agree to live with him...

992
00:58:46,461 --> 00:58:48,429
in a place that I choose?

993
00:58:50,030 --> 00:58:52,065
If you make me whole again.

994
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:55,536
I have to warn you, Nimue...

995
00:58:56,203 --> 00:58:58,372
that if you go to this place...

996
00:58:58,373 --> 00:59:00,741
you can never leave it.

997
00:59:01,809 --> 00:59:03,377
Will he come to me there?

998
00:59:03,378 --> 00:59:05,612
Yes... he will.

999
00:59:12,219 --> 00:59:13,821
Then, do it, Mab!

1000
01:00:05,272 --> 01:00:06,774
I've got to watch?

1001
01:00:07,274 --> 01:00:09,276
The sin was mine... not hers.

1002
01:00:15,616 --> 01:00:17,117
It's too late!

1003
01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:27,961
Merlin...

1004
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:14,007
Launcelot...

1005
01:01:14,008 --> 01:01:16,844
always left everything to the last moment.

1006
01:01:17,678 --> 01:01:19,413
But then, my memory of Launcelot is that...

1007
01:01:20,013 --> 01:01:22,015
he never got anything right.

1008
01:01:22,750 --> 01:01:23,917
Thank God!

1009
01:01:25,953 --> 01:01:28,155
And so Launcelot, and Guinevere...

1010
01:01:28,156 --> 01:01:29,690
rode out of my story...

1011
01:01:30,691 --> 01:01:32,526
and into legend.

1012
01:01:36,196 --> 01:01:37,698
What's the meaning of this?

1013
01:01:37,699 --> 01:01:39,833
You tricked us, Father...

1014
01:01:39,834 --> 01:01:41,735
you pretended to condemn
the queen to the stake...

1015
01:01:41,736 --> 01:01:42,936
then you had her rescued...

1016
01:01:42,937 --> 01:01:44,705
by your damned wizard!

1017
01:01:45,539 --> 01:01:46,640
You hadn't even the courage...

1018
01:01:46,641 --> 01:01:48,542
to set her free, yourself.

1019
01:01:49,543 --> 01:01:51,211
That's true...

1020
01:01:51,212 --> 01:01:52,880
I should have done it.

1021
01:01:53,447 --> 01:01:54,348
One law for you...

1022
01:01:54,349 --> 01:01:55,716
and another for the rest of us.

1023
01:01:55,717 --> 01:01:57,217
We can't live like that!

1024
01:01:57,218 --> 01:01:58,552
Do you hear?

1025
01:01:59,052 --> 01:02:01,388
They can't live like that!

1026
01:02:01,722 --> 01:02:04,224
I call upon all true-born Britains...

1027
01:02:04,225 --> 01:02:06,727
to rally to freedom's flag!

1028
01:02:17,404 --> 01:02:19,239
You caught me by surprise, Father.

1029
01:02:20,407 --> 01:02:22,075
I know how that is...

1030
01:02:22,076 --> 01:02:25,579
Nobles, the time for talking is over.

1031
01:02:26,947 --> 01:02:29,083
Those who value right, and justice...

1032
01:02:29,084 --> 01:02:30,751
follow me.

1033
01:02:59,379 --> 01:03:00,614
Who's there?

1034
01:03:01,448 --> 01:03:02,950
Father Abbot...

1035
01:03:02,951 --> 01:03:04,618
I rode all night to get here.

1036
01:03:04,619 --> 01:03:06,120
Nimue's gone!

1037
01:03:06,121 --> 01:03:07,387
- She's gone?
- Yes.

1038
01:03:07,388 --> 01:03:08,789
But she left you a message...

1039
01:03:08,790 --> 01:03:10,157
that she'll be waiting for you...

1040
01:03:10,158 --> 01:03:12,459
at the door of magic.

1041
01:03:14,628 --> 01:03:16,130
You're a liar!

1042
01:03:17,798 --> 01:03:19,299
How can you say such a thing?

1043
01:03:19,300 --> 01:03:21,201
You're a liar!

1044
01:03:33,981 --> 01:03:36,483
I'm glad to see you haven't lost

1045
01:03:36,484 --> 01:03:38,652
all the skills I taught you.

1046
01:03:38,653 --> 01:03:40,154
I've lost none of them...

1047
01:03:40,155 --> 01:03:42,322
and it was Frik, who taught me.

1048
01:03:42,323 --> 01:03:44,158
Don't mention that ingrate!

1049
01:03:45,325 --> 01:03:47,161
He's left my employment...

1050
01:03:47,162 --> 01:03:48,495
without a reference!

1051
01:03:48,496 --> 01:03:50,497
Anyway...

1052
01:03:50,498 --> 01:03:53,500
Nimue has gone...

1053
01:03:53,667 --> 01:03:57,504
and she does want you to join her...

1054
01:03:57,547 --> 01:03:59,173
when you're ready.

1055
01:04:11,185 --> 01:04:12,519
Merlin!

1056
01:04:13,253 --> 01:04:14,855
My noblemen...

1057
01:04:14,856 --> 01:04:16,256
don't want you with us

1058
01:04:16,257 --> 01:04:17,858
against Mordred.

1059
01:04:18,692 --> 01:04:19,860
They say that if you come...

1060
01:04:20,594 --> 01:04:22,529
then they won't follow me.

1061
01:04:24,198 --> 01:04:25,532
Ah...

1062
01:04:26,366 --> 01:04:28,202
What will you do now?

1063
01:04:29,203 --> 01:04:30,537
Close my books...

1064
01:04:30,538 --> 01:04:31,872
break my wand...

1065
01:04:31,873 --> 01:04:34,208
and... retire.

1066
01:04:35,442 --> 01:04:36,710
I have a life to live, and... uh...

1067
01:04:38,078 --> 01:04:39,546
a chance to live it.

1068
01:04:40,214 --> 01:04:41,381
Nimue?

1069
01:04:41,382 --> 01:04:42,983
I'm going to meet her, now.

1070
01:04:45,753 --> 01:04:47,387
You'll be able to deal with Mordred?

1071
01:04:48,555 --> 01:04:50,224
It's just one more battle...

1072
01:04:50,225 --> 01:04:52,059
and right is on our side.

1073
01:05:02,069 --> 01:05:04,071
I'm proud of you, Arthur.

1074
01:05:13,580 --> 01:05:15,082
Don't worry about me, Merlin.

1075
01:05:16,083 --> 01:05:18,085
I've still got Excaliber.

1076
01:05:42,443 --> 01:05:43,777
Hello...

1077
01:05:55,222 --> 01:05:56,623
Nimue...

1078
01:05:58,358 --> 01:05:59,626
Nimue...

1079
01:05:59,627 --> 01:06:00,627
Merlin...

1080
01:06:01,261 --> 01:06:02,629
I am here...

1081
01:07:04,358 --> 01:07:05,492
Look!

1082
01:07:07,961 --> 01:07:09,530
Look where we are...

1083
01:07:38,725 --> 01:07:40,561
This is all Mab...

1084
01:07:41,028 --> 01:07:43,430
Oh... forget her...

1085
01:07:43,897 --> 01:07:45,065
we've wasted...

1086
01:07:45,066 --> 01:07:46,366
so much of our lives together...

1087
01:07:46,367 --> 01:07:48,102
we're ready.

1088
01:07:49,236 --> 01:07:51,105
Now, it's our turn.

1089
01:07:51,106 --> 01:07:53,907
Isn't it what you've always wanted?

1090
01:08:39,620 --> 01:08:40,988
Gawaine!

1091
01:08:41,789 --> 01:08:43,457
What a pleasant surprise!

1092
01:08:43,524 --> 01:08:46,293
Stop talking, Mordred... and fight!

1093
01:08:46,326 --> 01:08:47,728
I though you might enjoy a little light...

1094
01:08:47,729 --> 01:08:49,797
conversaton, before you die.

1095
01:08:49,798 --> 01:08:51,465
But... as you wish.

1096
01:09:02,142 --> 01:09:03,811
Mordred!

1097
01:09:09,316 --> 01:09:11,151
Clever boy!

1098
01:09:11,152 --> 01:09:12,152
Father!

1099
01:09:29,503 --> 01:09:31,839
So...

1100
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:32,840
Mordred.

1101
01:09:33,173 --> 01:09:34,174
Hello...

1102
01:09:35,509 --> 01:09:36,510
Father.

1103
01:09:38,345 --> 01:09:41,014
It's time to... end it all.

1104
01:09:41,015 --> 01:09:42,015
Well...

1105
01:09:42,850 --> 01:09:44,685
we agree on that, at least.

1106
01:09:45,352 --> 01:09:46,587
You know, Father...

1107
01:09:46,588 --> 01:09:48,522
if you'd lived...

1108
01:09:48,523 --> 01:09:49,523
I don't think we'd have been very...

1109
01:09:49,524 --> 01:09:51,024
happy as a family.

1110
01:09:58,699 --> 01:10:00,367
What is it, Merlin?

1111
01:10:02,202 --> 01:10:03,704
I heard a scream.

1112
01:10:05,372 --> 01:10:07,207
I didn't hear anything.

1113
01:10:08,542 --> 01:10:10,544
It's the sound of battle.

1114
01:10:11,712 --> 01:10:13,881
Arthur and Mordred.

1115
01:10:13,882 --> 01:10:15,716
Oh... no...

1116
01:10:15,717 --> 01:10:18,051
It's nothing to do with us.

1117
01:10:19,052 --> 01:10:20,053
No...

1118
01:11:19,613 --> 01:11:21,949
I'm sorry... Mordred.

1119
01:11:22,616 --> 01:11:23,951
Don't tell me, Father...

1120
01:11:23,984 --> 01:11:25,953
another sin?

1121
01:11:26,787 --> 01:11:28,956
You've killed your own son.

1122
01:11:54,314 --> 01:11:56,316
Mordred...!

1123
01:12:17,004 --> 01:12:19,006
Arthur is dying.

1124
01:12:19,007 --> 01:12:20,841
I must go to him.

1125
01:12:22,142 --> 01:12:24,011
I'll be back very soon.

1126
01:12:24,845 --> 01:12:26,680
I'll be waiting for you...

1127
01:12:27,014 --> 01:12:29,183
always.

1128
01:12:30,184 --> 01:12:33,520
Very soon... I swear!

1129
01:12:53,774 --> 01:12:56,376
Why didn't you tell me?

1130
01:12:59,546 --> 01:13:01,048
Nimue...

1131
01:13:04,384 --> 01:13:07,221
I knew I would never see her again.

1132
01:13:08,388 --> 01:13:13,060
I cannot save you...

1133
01:13:14,561 --> 01:13:17,898
Don't die, Mordred.

1134
01:13:19,066 --> 01:13:21,068
Die here, Auntie Mab...

1135
01:13:21,902 --> 01:13:24,238
that's the last thing I shall do.

1136
01:13:31,412 --> 01:13:33,747
No...

1137
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:02,476
Merlin... old friend...

1138
01:14:05,779 --> 01:14:08,115
I knew you would come.

1139
01:14:08,449 --> 01:14:10,784
How goes the day, Arthur?

1140
01:14:11,118 --> 01:14:13,120
I've seen better...

1141
01:14:19,126 --> 01:14:20,127
Merlin...

1142
01:14:21,128 --> 01:14:23,797
take the sword to the lake...

1143
01:14:25,065 --> 01:14:27,301
No one must have it.

1144
01:14:29,970 --> 01:14:33,140
Go, Merlin... now!

1145
01:14:35,142 --> 01:14:37,311
Rest easy, son...

1146
01:14:39,146 --> 01:14:40,147
You were the right man...

1147
01:14:40,148 --> 01:14:42,149
to hold Excaliber.

1148
01:15:04,171 --> 01:15:06,340
Take it back, Lady...

1149
01:15:20,020 --> 01:15:21,855
You lied to me...

1150
01:15:27,194 --> 01:15:30,364
I didn't lie to you, Merlin.

1151
01:15:30,365 --> 01:15:34,868
I told you the answer was at Joyous Guarde.

1152
01:15:35,536 --> 01:15:37,871
That's where I found Launcelot.

1153
01:15:41,875 --> 01:15:43,710
It wasn't Launcelot, was it?

1154
01:15:43,711 --> 01:15:46,814
It was the boy... Galahad.

1155
01:15:49,049 --> 01:15:52,319
It's human to make mistakes, Merlin.

1156
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:55,889
and part of you is human...

1157
01:15:55,890 --> 01:15:58,559
the best part.

1158
01:15:59,226 --> 01:16:00,894
Goodbye, Merlin...

1159
01:16:01,229 --> 01:16:05,899
my sister, Mab, was right about one thing...

1160
01:16:05,900 --> 01:16:07,901
when we're forgotten...

1161
01:16:09,069 --> 01:16:12,906
we cease to exist.

1162
01:16:34,595 --> 01:16:35,929
What are you doing here, Frik?

1163
01:16:35,963 --> 01:16:38,599
Betraying my principles, I'm afraid.

1164
01:16:38,600 --> 01:16:39,600
Indeed, I've always believed...

1165
01:16:39,601 --> 01:16:41,135
that it was better to be a coward...

1166
01:16:41,136 --> 01:16:42,202
for a second...

1167
01:16:42,203 --> 01:16:43,737
than dead for a lifetime.

1168
01:16:43,738 --> 01:16:44,738
And yet...

1169
01:16:44,739 --> 01:16:46,140
here I am fighting...

1170
01:16:46,907 --> 01:16:48,275
fighting on the side of right...

1171
01:16:48,276 --> 01:16:49,276
which is worse.

1172
01:16:50,611 --> 01:16:51,612
And Mab?

1173
01:16:52,780 --> 01:16:53,614
As a matter of fact...

1174
01:16:53,615 --> 01:16:54,681
I gave in my notice.

1175
01:16:55,616 --> 01:16:58,218
If you're going after her, Master Merlin...

1176
01:16:58,552 --> 01:17:00,287
you'll need help.

1177
01:17:18,038 --> 01:17:19,706
I knew I'd find you here, Mab.

1178
01:17:21,008 --> 01:17:23,477
You've come to see my final triumph?

1179
01:17:23,478 --> 01:17:25,646
No, I've come to see your final defeat.

1180
01:17:26,980 --> 01:17:29,817
You always were a dreamer, Merlin.

1181
01:17:30,984 --> 01:17:32,486
Let me see...

1182
01:17:32,719 --> 01:17:34,988
you've lost Arthur...

1183
01:17:35,589 --> 01:17:36,857
the battle...

1184
01:17:37,825 --> 01:17:39,760
you're one, true love...

1185
01:17:39,761 --> 01:17:41,995
The battle isn't over yet, Mab.

1186
01:17:42,162 --> 01:17:44,498
You can't win...

1187
01:17:47,668 --> 01:17:50,671
Why are you consulting with that traitor?

1188
01:17:50,672 --> 01:17:52,506
Madam! After all my years of...

1189
01:17:52,507 --> 01:17:53,741
of faithful service... I mean that's...

1190
01:17:53,742 --> 01:17:55,175
rather harsh.

1191
01:17:55,176 --> 01:17:57,344
Not as harsh as I'm going to be...

1192
01:17:57,345 --> 01:17:59,680
Sorry! Can't stay!

1193
01:18:04,184 --> 01:18:06,353
Mordred's dead...

1194
01:18:06,354 --> 01:18:08,689
So, we both have nothing to lose.

1195
01:18:10,157 --> 01:18:13,360
The battle is just between you, and me, Mab.

1196
01:18:48,395 --> 01:18:52,066
I'll show you how weak I am...

1197
01:19:39,646 --> 01:19:42,783
My strength may be fading, Merlin...

1198
01:19:43,784 --> 01:19:46,053
but I can still deal with...

1199
01:19:46,120 --> 01:19:48,122
these poor humans.

1200
01:19:49,456 --> 01:19:51,125
What do you plan to do?

1201
01:19:51,291 --> 01:19:55,629
Use you puny sword... on me?

1202
01:19:55,796 --> 01:19:56,797
No, Mab...

1203
01:19:57,464 --> 01:20:00,134
we're just going to forget you.

1204
01:20:06,473 --> 01:20:08,142
Merlin?

1205
01:20:09,042 --> 01:20:10,477
What are you doing?

1206
01:20:10,478 --> 01:20:11,478
You can't fight us...

1207
01:20:11,479 --> 01:20:12,479
or frighten us...

1208
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:13,480
you're just...

1209
01:20:13,814 --> 01:20:16,316
not important enough, anymore.

1210
01:20:16,317 --> 01:20:19,486
We forget you, Queen Mab.

1211
01:20:20,154 --> 01:20:22,156
Go join your sister, in the lake...

1212
01:20:22,823 --> 01:20:24,491
and be forgotten.

1213
01:20:26,326 --> 01:20:29,163
Look at me...

1214
01:20:31,832 --> 01:20:33,667
Look at me!

1215
01:20:36,170 --> 01:20:37,504
Frik!

1216
01:20:41,675 --> 01:20:43,510
Merlin!

1217
01:20:45,012 --> 01:20:46,680
Merlin!

1218
01:20:51,685 --> 01:20:53,420
Don't forget me, Merlin...

1219
01:20:53,454 --> 01:20:56,690
I... uh... love you...

1220
01:20:56,691 --> 01:20:58,525
as a son.

1221
01:21:00,127 --> 01:21:01,195
Merlin?

1222
01:21:03,864 --> 01:21:05,365
Merlin!

1223
01:21:06,700 --> 01:21:08,869
You failed!

1224
01:21:09,870 --> 01:21:11,071
I had won.

1225
01:21:12,439 --> 01:21:14,575
I was trying to smile...

1226
01:21:14,875 --> 01:21:15,876
but it was the smile...

1227
01:21:15,877 --> 01:21:18,045
of... desolation.

1228
01:21:18,545 --> 01:21:19,580
Inside I felt...

1229
01:21:19,581 --> 01:21:20,881
only the pity...

1230
01:21:20,914 --> 01:21:21,815
and the terror...

1231
01:21:21,849 --> 01:21:24,218
and the waste of it all.

1232
01:21:24,219 --> 01:21:26,053
Everyone I ever loved...

1233
01:21:26,054 --> 01:21:27,821
and who ever loved me...

1234
01:21:28,389 --> 01:21:29,757
all gone.

1235
01:21:29,923 --> 01:21:31,225
All gone, now.

1236
01:21:32,559 --> 01:21:35,396
And then... Galahad returned...

1237
01:21:35,562 --> 01:21:37,765
and brought with him... the Holy Grail...

1238
01:21:37,766 --> 01:21:38,899
and spring.

1239
01:21:39,900 --> 01:21:42,903
and the land became fertile, again.

1240
01:21:42,904 --> 01:21:44,405
And the cycle of death...

1241
01:21:44,406 --> 01:21:46,240
and darkness ended...

1242
01:21:47,574 --> 01:21:49,910
and so does my story.

1243
01:21:51,445 --> 01:21:52,446
Now...

1244
01:21:53,414 --> 01:21:54,581
if my story...

1245
01:21:54,582 --> 01:21:56,750
entertained, or enchanted...

1246
01:21:57,418 --> 01:21:59,586
you may show you appreciaton...

1247
01:21:59,753 --> 01:22:01,922
in any way you see fit...

1248
01:22:01,923 --> 01:22:03,257
but particularly...

1249
01:22:03,258 --> 01:22:05,092
with money.

1250
01:22:05,426 --> 01:22:06,760
Master Merlin...

1251
01:22:06,761 --> 01:22:09,263
did you ever find Nimue?

1252
01:22:09,430 --> 01:22:10,831
No, I never found Nimue...

1253
01:22:11,432 --> 01:22:13,267
or even the cave, again.

1254
01:22:14,134 --> 01:22:15,602
What about the magic?

1255
01:22:15,603 --> 01:22:17,271
Can you still do magic?

1256
01:22:17,272 --> 01:22:18,272
No...

1257
01:22:18,273 --> 01:22:20,941
I got out of the habit, and besides...

1258
01:22:21,775 --> 01:22:23,944
nobody believes in it anymore.

1259
01:22:26,280 --> 01:22:27,948
Thank-you...

1260
01:22:28,782 --> 01:22:29,616
it's all over, friend...

1261
01:22:29,617 --> 01:22:31,952
there is no more.

1262
01:22:33,287 --> 01:22:34,354
Is it all exactly...

1263
01:22:34,355 --> 01:22:35,823
the way I remember it...

1264
01:22:35,824 --> 01:22:37,491
Master Merlin?

1265
01:22:37,492 --> 01:22:38,525
Frik...

1266
01:22:38,792 --> 01:22:40,561
Is it you?

1267
01:22:42,629 --> 01:22:44,565
Yes... it's me.

1268
01:22:52,840 --> 01:22:54,374
I must say, you do...

1269
01:22:54,375 --> 01:22:56,310
tell a rather good tale...

1270
01:22:56,311 --> 01:22:58,245
terribly exciting and all.

1271
01:22:58,479 --> 01:23:00,314
But I was intrigued...

1272
01:23:00,315 --> 01:23:02,382
that you chose to omit certain...

1273
01:23:02,383 --> 01:23:03,817
Well, that's the way they like it...

1274
01:23:03,818 --> 01:23:04,985
and besides...

1275
01:23:05,719 --> 01:23:06,653
I didn't think they'd believe it...

1276
01:23:06,654 --> 01:23:08,489
if I told the way it really was.

1277
01:23:09,390 --> 01:23:10,791
And how are you doing...

1278
01:23:10,824 --> 01:23:12,493
in this world, Master Frik?

1279
01:23:13,160 --> 01:23:14,328
Well... I mean... there will

1280
01:23:14,329 --> 01:23:15,996
always be a need...

1281
01:23:15,997 --> 01:23:18,499
for the perfect gentleman's gentleman.

1282
01:23:18,500 --> 01:23:20,267
And I was, and always will be...

1283
01:23:20,268 --> 01:23:22,169
one of the best, you see.

1284
01:23:26,807 --> 01:23:28,108
Ohh... it can't be...

1285
01:23:29,343 --> 01:23:30,344
It 'tis...

1286
01:23:30,345 --> 01:23:32,346
Sir Rupert!

1287
01:23:32,347 --> 01:23:35,015
Yes, well I found him grazing in a field...

1288
01:23:35,016 --> 01:23:36,550
then, we got to reminising.

1289
01:23:37,418 --> 01:23:39,086
Dear old boy...

1290
01:23:39,087 --> 01:23:40,687
shouldn't you be dead by now?

1291
01:23:40,688 --> 01:23:42,089
No... no...

1292
01:23:42,090 --> 01:23:43,357
there's a little magic...

1293
01:23:43,358 --> 01:23:45,025
in me, too, Merlin.

1294
01:23:45,292 --> 01:23:46,960
Oh, I almost forgot...

1295
01:23:47,361 --> 01:23:49,196
Nimue...

1296
01:23:49,197 --> 01:23:50,197
What about her?

1297
01:23:50,198 --> 01:23:51,198
Oh, nothing really...

1298
01:23:51,199 --> 01:23:53,367
other than she was inquiring about you...

1299
01:23:53,368 --> 01:23:55,536
when I saw her... last month.

1300
01:23:56,703 --> 01:23:58,038
I don't understand...

1301
01:23:59,039 --> 01:24:00,307
what happened?

1302
01:24:00,308 --> 01:24:02,543
Sometime, after Mab disappeared...

1303
01:24:02,544 --> 01:24:05,779
her spells began to lose their power.

1304
01:24:05,979 --> 01:24:08,382
And, Nimue was set free!

1305
01:24:10,217 --> 01:24:11,552
Where is she, Frik?

1306
01:24:11,553 --> 01:24:13,721
Sir Rupert knows...

1307
01:24:15,055 --> 01:24:16,724
Thank-you, my old friend...

1308
01:24:16,890 --> 01:24:18,325
for everything.

1309
01:24:18,326 --> 01:24:19,493
Oh, no need to thank me...

1310
01:24:19,494 --> 01:24:22,730
I just... love happy endings.

1311
01:24:44,251 --> 01:24:46,086
Merlin...

1312
01:24:50,257 --> 01:24:52,760
Oh... my dearest...

1313
01:24:58,098 --> 01:25:00,267
Frik found you...

1314
01:25:00,768 --> 01:25:01,769
I never believed...

1315
01:25:01,770 --> 01:25:04,104
I would ever see you, again.

1316
01:25:05,773 --> 01:25:07,608
So many years... lost.

1317
01:25:13,046 --> 01:25:14,948
You've grown old...

1318
01:25:20,120 --> 01:25:22,289
You, too.

1319
01:25:23,791 --> 01:25:25,125
Does it matter?

1320
01:25:25,793 --> 01:25:28,796
No... not anymore.

1321
01:25:32,132 --> 01:25:33,133
What?

1322
01:25:36,804 --> 01:25:39,473
I think I have one, last trick...

1323
01:26:16,844 --> 01:26:18,312
There's no more...

1324
01:26:18,479 --> 01:26:21,348
That's the end of magic.
