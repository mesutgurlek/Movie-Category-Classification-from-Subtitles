1
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:00,750
Cheers.

2
00:01:06,766 --> 00:01:07,892
Bitterman?

3
00:01:11,504 --> 00:01:12,971
Why are you shaving?

4
00:01:13,139 --> 00:01:14,868
Because Robin doesn't have a beard.

5
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:17,703
Bitterman, we're only doing this
for a bit of a laugh.

6
00:01:17,877 --> 00:01:20,402
We're not genuine crime fighters, are we?

7
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,447
And if we were, you would not be
my first choice of sidekick.

8
00:01:23,616 --> 00:01:26,779
Look at your shoes.
They're your chauffeur shoes, aren't they?

9
00:01:27,053 --> 00:01:28,520
I can see your tummy.

10
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:31,857
Mr. Bach, are you sure you wanna go
to your mother's fundraiser like this?

11
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:34,116
I think it's black-tie.

12
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:36,523
This is black.

13
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:39,128
Just that Hobson said
not to get into any trouble.

14
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:42,530
What trouble could possibly come
from a harmless game of dress-up?

15
00:01:42,702 --> 00:01:43,964
Hmm?

16
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:45,461
Already bought the car.

17
00:01:53,546 --> 00:01:54,877
You think they're chasing us?

18
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:58,211
Don't be ridiculous, this is the Batmobile.
We're their friends.

19
00:01:58,384 --> 00:02:00,318
Driver, pull the car over.

20
00:02:00,487 --> 00:02:01,545
How do you slow down?

21
00:02:05,024 --> 00:02:08,152
- Where are the brakes on this thing?
- What do you suppose this does?

22
00:02:16,035 --> 00:02:17,059
- Oh!
- Ow!

23
00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:31,014
Ask the police for directions
to your mother's fundraiser.

24
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:33,448
I think that problem
has been recently superseded.

25
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:36,714
- Tell them it's at a museum.
- We destroyed a beloved landmark.

26
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:38,357
It's around here somewhere.

27
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:40,652
I need you to not to
talk for a little while.

28
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:43,921
Good evening, officers.
What seems to be the problem?

29
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:45,428
You're drunk again, Arthur.

30
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,096
No. I have remained drunk
since our last encounter.

31
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:54,502
Let's go. Batman and Robin,
out of the car. Come on.

32
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:59,333
Could I just point out
the elephant in the room?

33
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:02,845
Are these testicles strictly necessary?
They're an accident waiting to happen.

34
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,415
Okay, let's go. Come on.

35
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:07,883
See, I don't like being this close
to these balls.

36
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:09,552
I'll be right with you.

37
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:17,287
Gotham is safe.

38
00:03:17,463 --> 00:03:18,555
Oh, man.

39
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:22,167
If I could just write you a check
for the damage to your golden cow...

40
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:24,599
...we can all be about our business.
Say no more.

41
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:27,604
- Or not. Turn around. Come on.
- What's it...?

42
00:03:27,774 --> 00:03:29,264
- Are we going to prison?
- Yes.

43
00:03:29,442 --> 00:03:31,910
We're going to prison.
We're going to prison, Bitterman.

44
00:03:32,078 --> 00:03:34,774
- Yes.
- I knew this day would come and it's today.

45
00:03:35,181 --> 00:03:36,671
That's all well and good...

46
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:40,080
...but it's not a market crash
we're concerned about.

47
00:03:40,253 --> 00:03:41,845
Your concerns are legitimate, chancellor.

48
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:46,354
I do assure you that Arthur's
a bit more serious these days.

49
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:49,324
- He's begun to take an interest in finance.
- Wonderful.

50
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,955
- Could you excuse us?
- Sure.

51
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:04,271
I'm sorry, Vivienne. The university
cannot wager its endowment...

52
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:08,107
...on a fund
with such an uncertain future.

53
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:18,623
He's like a ship without an anchor.

54
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:23,289
Maybe it's time we tied him
to another ship.

55
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:32,863
Tito! Tito, I'll see you at the cockfight.
Better be what I think it is.

56
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:34,973
Wow, you paid for everyone's release?

57
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:37,735
It seemed unfair that we'd leave
and that they'd remain.

58
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:41,607
How do you explain
this frivolous spending during a recession?

59
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:43,039
Fair point.

60
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:44,649
Uh, recession...

61
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:47,512
Free money!

62
00:04:49,088 --> 00:04:50,248
This is yours.

63
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:53,051
Okay, recession's over! We're in a boom!

64
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:46,404
That was brave.
What incredible flexibility.

65
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:50,340
- Hello, Hobson.
- Morning, Arthur. And friend.

66
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:51,540
Tiffany.

67
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:54,846
Oh, points for knowing her name
and saying it with confidence.

68
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:57,581
I made a mental association
with my lamp.

69
00:05:57,757 --> 00:06:01,716
Tiffany, this is my nanny, Hobson,
my best friend in the whole world.

70
00:06:01,894 --> 00:06:05,125
- Your nanny?
- He's merely shaped like an adult.

71
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:07,391
So how are you feeling
on the other side of...

72
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:09,933
...that vast moat of champagne
called "last night"?

73
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:11,127
Splendid.

74
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:14,569
Your mother called.
She wants to see you this morning.

75
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:18,674
Vivienne? Why do you think
Vivienne wants to see me today?

76
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:19,903
It doesn't make sense.

77
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,610
After destroying
a world-famous landmark...

78
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:27,276
...and giving away $78,000
from an ATM, I can't imagine.

79
00:06:27,453 --> 00:06:29,751
- Is she gonna stay here?
- Um...

80
00:06:29,922 --> 00:06:32,857
...I wouldn't recommend letting him
get used to your breasts, dear.

81
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:36,483
He's got an addictive personality,
you know. He was at mine till he was 6.

82
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,158
Hobson.

83
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:40,925
I had to dab Tabasco on the nipples
to see him off.

84
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:44,365
- That lady has never once breast-fed me.
- Despite his best efforts.

85
00:06:44,537 --> 00:06:46,004
Hey, that's my purse.

86
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:47,196
Oh.

87
00:06:47,373 --> 00:06:50,274
Look, I don't know how that
got in there. I don't know, Arthur.

88
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:54,504
It's probably just one of those mysteries
that will never be discovered.

89
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,580
JFK, who nicked my watch.

90
00:06:57,283 --> 00:07:00,150
- Oh, that's actually mine.
- Bravo, well done.

91
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,287
Something of yours in your handbag.

92
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:04,923
No, you don't have to
go through the pictures, actually.

93
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:07,218
- Arthur.
- Oh, don't worry about all that.

94
00:07:07,393 --> 00:07:09,987
That's very rude. Invasion of privacy.

95
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:14,661
Oh, you're leaving?
I support your decision 100 percent.

96
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:18,463
Will you be requiring a taxi
or just getting into a random passing car?

97
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:22,507
You guys are weird and racist.

98
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:23,699
Bye-bye, Tiffany.

99
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:26,936
I'll call you,
if you've not stolen my phone.

100
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:31,379
Help yourself to that priceless sculpture
on your way out the door.

101
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:34,244
Put it down.

102
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,617
Say goodbye
to your other new friends now, Arthur.

103
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,691
They have to go back to the real world.

104
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:45,695
Oh, I hate the real world, Hobson.
I'll work from bed today if you don't mind.

105
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:47,893
Hobson.

106
00:07:48,367 --> 00:07:50,028
Breakfast, now.

107
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:05,844
Here.

108
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:13,486
Hobson!

109
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:16,389
Hobson?

110
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:20,163
Hobson! Hobson! Hobson!

111
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:23,325
- Hobson! Hobson!
- What?

112
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:27,400
Lesbian Simon and Garfunkel,
61st and Park.

113
00:08:27,573 --> 00:08:28,972
Look.

114
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:40,575
Hmm. Well spotted.
Another of your wasted talents.

115
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:45,023
Wash your winkie. Thoroughly.

116
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:49,423
Heaven knows what exotic wildlife
that girl was harboring between her thighs.

117
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:54,197
Whoa, Hobson. You're missing Asian you.

118
00:08:55,968 --> 00:08:58,562
Ah! You're going too quickly.
You're pushing it too hard.

119
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:01,798
- I don't like it here, Hobson.
- Course you don't. People work here.

120
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:04,442
But there's an elevator.
You get to press the buttons.

121
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:05,804
Silver lining.

122
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:18,546
Mr. Bach?

123
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:20,316
Your mother will see you now.

124
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:26,163
Don't worry, Arthur, it won't take long.
Then we'll watch cartoons.

125
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:40,774
Hello, Arthur.

126
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:42,938
Oh, hello, Susan.

127
00:09:43,115 --> 00:09:47,950
I didn't see you there coming down this long,
brightly-lit, unobstructed corridor...

128
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,088
...walking straight towards me.

129
00:09:51,123 --> 00:09:52,613
I owe you a call, don't I?

130
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,284
From January.

131
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:57,953
We dated three months.
You just disappeared.

132
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:59,825
When Houdini did it, it was fun.

133
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:01,296
Hmm.

134
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:04,027
Houdini was a conjurer.
He used to disappear.

135
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:07,229
- I understood the reference.
- I just thought it deserved more.

136
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:13,003
You know, you're the only man
I ever slept with who broke up with me.

137
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:15,145
- Really?
- Really.

138
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:16,611
Well, call me a romantic...

139
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:21,048
...but I believe
that dating should involve crazy things...

140
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:23,586
...like talking.
Oh, ha, ha.

141
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:26,816
- What are we gonna do with you, Arthur?
- Release me into the wild.

142
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:28,893
Hunt me down with dogs.

143
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:31,557
Good luck with your mother.

144
00:10:37,536 --> 00:10:39,231
Come in, Arthur.

145
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:42,740
Oh, hello. The future's now.

146
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:47,638
Hello, Vivienne. I remember you
from when I used to live in your womb.

147
00:10:50,282 --> 00:10:51,909
Arthur.

148
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,953
Well, today, Arthur,
we're gonna have a friendly chat.

149
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:56,645
Then a serious talk.

150
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:59,347
And finally,
I'm going to offer you an ultimatum.

151
00:10:59,525 --> 00:11:00,856
How does all that sound?

152
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:03,086
Like it would be improved by vodka.

153
00:11:03,262 --> 00:11:05,253
So I hear you've been having fun.

154
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:08,059
Quite the contrary, actually.
I've been rather busy.

155
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:12,671
I've got a riding boot shoot and, uh,
I had a bit of a scare with Bitterman.

156
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:16,501
Thought he'd found a lump. Turned out
it was just his phone in his back pocket.

157
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,041
But worrying time nonetheless.

158
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:22,506
Well, that went very well.
Surprisingly warm. Our best chat yet.

159
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:25,617
I'm aware that our relationship
has never been ideal.

160
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:26,945
Mm...

161
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,681
No, please. Don't reproach yourself.

162
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:32,346
Yes, motherhood wasn't your forte...

163
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:36,359
...but you did provide me with
that lovable cloth monkey as a surrogate.

164
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,360
You know, sometimes I'm glad he's gone.

165
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:41,193
I'm gonna assume you mean Father
and not Mr. Tickles.

166
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,396
So that he never had to see this.

167
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:48,732
In fairness,
those two told me they were over 18.

168
00:11:48,908 --> 00:11:51,934
And that they weren't men.
It's terrible the way you find out.

169
00:11:52,344 --> 00:11:56,440
Who is this lovable rogue who's rough around
the edges, but with stars in his eyes?

170
00:11:56,849 --> 00:11:58,714
What forgivable antics.

171
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:02,615
Who could be anything other than charmed
by this delightful individual?

172
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,323
- Congratulations.
- How can you squander...

173
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:09,222
...your considerable intelligence
on idiocy like this?

174
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:12,626
It's quite easy.
I don't consider it to be idiocy...

175
00:12:12,798 --> 00:12:16,734
...rather a savantish gift
for defying death with fun.

176
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:19,837
That's your justification?
That's why you crashed a Batmobile?

177
00:12:20,005 --> 00:12:23,168
Yes, it is. Are we done?

178
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:24,569
Sit down.

179
00:12:28,647 --> 00:12:34,210
When the sole heir of a corporation as big as
ours gets arrested, it frightens investors.

180
00:12:34,386 --> 00:12:36,445
The nonsense has to stop.

181
00:12:36,822 --> 00:12:40,087
As the charming, coffee-colored gentleman
who runs this country said...

182
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:43,057
...the time has come
to set aside childish things.

183
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:45,857
I don't think
you can say "coffee-colored."

184
00:12:46,031 --> 00:12:48,397
So I've arrived at a solution.

185
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:50,601
- Susan Johnson.
- Interesting.

186
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:54,262
Dresses well.
Borderline personality disorder.

187
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,873
How is that a solution?

188
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:58,373
You're going to marry her, Arthur.

189
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:02,379
- Why?
- Susan is a very impressive woman.

190
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:07,112
Lovely, yes.
She's certainly in control of that beast.

191
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:12,014
Capable woman, and quite willing to help
poor people if there's a camera nearby.

192
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:15,456
Actually, if you want videos of Susan,
you should come to my apartment.

193
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:19,086
- I've got one that'll knock your socks off.
- Bach Worldwide has been run...

194
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:20,823
...by a Bach for generations.

195
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,331
With Susan as one of us...

196
00:13:22,501 --> 00:13:27,063
...investors will be comforted to know the
line of succession doesn't end in a bottle.

197
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:28,706
When did you become so cynical?

198
00:13:28,874 --> 00:13:33,004
Marriage isn't a tool
to protect a corporate image.

199
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:35,545
It's to validate unwanted pregnancy.

200
00:13:35,714 --> 00:13:38,274
If that's how you feel, Arthur,
you give me no choice.

201
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:41,044
As of this moment, you are cut off.

202
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:46,390
What do you mean "cut off"?
Cut off from you and the?

203
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:50,826
You don't mean cut off from the?

204
00:13:51,697 --> 00:13:53,756
The money, Arthur.

205
00:13:58,737 --> 00:14:02,798
No. I'm not gonna allow you
to manipulate me, Vivienne.

206
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:05,102
I shall get married when I fall in love.

207
00:14:05,744 --> 00:14:09,202
I respect your integrity.
You've just lost $950 million.

208
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:16,050
Actually, Susan is a very special girl,
isn't she?

209
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:19,453
With that mouth,
that velvety, beautiful mouth...

210
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,058
...like a clown's mouth.

211
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:24,856
But not in a bad way.
Like a sexy clown.

212
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,964
And she'll make a wonderful wife.

213
00:14:27,132 --> 00:14:31,034
Yeah. I mean,
who wouldn't wanna marry a sexy clown?

214
00:14:31,937 --> 00:14:34,132
Congratulations, Vivienne. You win.

215
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,774
I don't respect you, Arthur...

216
00:14:36,942 --> 00:14:41,140
...but I do applaud your talent
for self-preservation.

217
00:14:41,313 --> 00:14:45,215
Congratulations. You're gonna be
a wealthy man for the rest of your life.

218
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:47,909
That's all I've ever wanted to be.

219
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:54,788
The ring your father
gave your mother, I believe.

220
00:14:58,697 --> 00:15:00,460
It's like an ice rink for a mouse.

221
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,027
I don't like Susan.

222
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:07,161
Well, I don't like you very much and we've
been happily stuck together for 30 years.

223
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:10,706
I know it's not perfect,
but Susan is smart and capable...

224
00:15:10,876 --> 00:15:13,276
...and you need a woman like that
to look after you.

225
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:18,348
I think I already have one of those.
In fact, do you want it?

226
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:24,887
Hobson, will you carry on
being my nanny?

227
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,824
This is just my mother
trying to control me.

228
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:30,452
Hey, Hobson, do you have the checkbook?

229
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:32,494
I wanna squander some wealth.

230
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:35,566
Ten thousand dollars
for this item from the czar's collection.

231
00:15:35,734 --> 00:15:40,034
Are we all done at 10,000? Ten thousand
dollars going once, going twice.

232
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,806
Twenty thousand dollars of money!

233
00:15:43,976 --> 00:15:45,841
Twenty thousand dollars is the bid.

234
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:47,876
Thank you, sir. Do I hear 30?
Do I hear 30,000?

235
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:49,912
Thirty thousand dollars, please.

236
00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:51,140
Thirty thousand.

237
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:52,807
Thirty-five thousand.

238
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:55,647
How dare you.
It's a challenge you want, is it?

239
00:15:55,821 --> 00:15:57,982
Yeah, I want a challenge, plus I bid first.

240
00:15:58,157 --> 00:16:01,388
That is irrelevant.
The highest number has supremacy.

241
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,152
You've clearly never been to an auction.

242
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:04,523
That's tit for tat.

243
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:06,961
That's exactly how the situation
in the Middle East began.

244
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:09,191
You leave me no choice.

245
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:12,235
One hundred thousand dollars
and one penny...

246
00:16:12,404 --> 00:16:16,238
...because you, sir, are
a vile spendthrift.

247
00:16:16,408 --> 00:16:19,343
Well, that's the first sensible thing
you've said all day.

248
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:24,973
Sold to one of the Mr. Bachs
for $100,000 and one penny.

249
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,209
- Thank you, sirs.
- Congratulations.

250
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:28,950
Hey, come on, Hobson.

251
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:31,885
You know I've always coveted
the cutlery of Czar Nicholas II.

252
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:33,752
- Me too.
- Oh.

253
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:36,385
Our last item up for bid today:

254
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:40,020
The suit in which Abraham Lincoln
delivered his second inaugural address.

255
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:43,695
Let's start the bidding at 50,000.
Do I hear 50,000?

256
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:45,866
I'll take it.

257
00:16:46,038 --> 00:16:48,700
And the teleportation
device in which it stands.

258
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:53,637
If you think this represents a victory
over your mother's financial tyranny...

259
00:16:53,812 --> 00:16:56,246
...you're deluded.
Thanks for the spoon, Arthur.

260
00:16:56,415 --> 00:16:59,851
- Anytime. Buy me a fork one day.
- Where's Bitterman with the car?

261
00:17:00,052 --> 00:17:02,316
He said he was gonna be
by the big gray thing.

262
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:03,750
- Where?
- He said...

263
00:17:03,922 --> 00:17:06,755
...the big gray sculpture thing
with things on it.

264
00:17:06,925 --> 00:17:09,416
It was like a riddle.
He can be very vague.

265
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:11,790
It's the blind leading the drunk.

266
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:14,558
Hobson, you find Bitterman
while I wander off.

267
00:17:22,274 --> 00:17:23,434
Wow.

268
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:24,633
What is this for?

269
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,201
Where's everyone going?

270
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:31,110
This is actually not Grand Central
Station, it's Grand Central Terminal.

271
00:17:31,283 --> 00:17:32,409
- Oh.
- Oh!

272
00:17:32,584 --> 00:17:35,985
- Sorry.
- No, no, I was static in a thoroughfare.

273
00:17:36,855 --> 00:17:40,256
Uh, I'm lost. Do you know where I can get
a drink, please?

274
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:41,586
Um...

275
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:45,229
This is really all I have.

276
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:47,128
Good luck.

277
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:48,391
- Come on.
- Coins.

278
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:52,469
- I played with these when I was a boy.
- Let's keep going. Time's a wasting.

279
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:53,969
Speaking of time...

280
00:17:54,139 --> 00:17:58,098
...the clock behind me is one of the
most expensive clocks in the world.

281
00:18:05,317 --> 00:18:07,683
Thousands of people
pass through here every day...

282
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:10,219
...and no one ever bothers to look up.

283
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:14,086
It's magical. It's the only place
in Manhattan where you can see the stars.

284
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:17,353
But it wasn't always that way...
Oh, you again.

285
00:18:18,964 --> 00:18:22,923
If you look in the corner you can see
one dirty brick...

286
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:27,801
...and the whole ceiling used to be
like that until it was renovated in 1998.

287
00:18:27,973 --> 00:18:32,307
Wow, this is brilliant. If you like ceilings,
I've got a beautiful one above my bed.

288
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,943
That sounded cheeky.
I didn't mean that. It lights up.

289
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,377
Thanks for that.

290
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:40,950
If you direct your attention to the
opposite corner, you'll see a...

291
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:44,286
...police officer.
Miss, I warned you about this.

292
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:47,186
You don't have a tour license
and now you're impeding foot traffic.

293
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:48,758
Come on, up, up, everybody up.

294
00:18:48,927 --> 00:18:52,829
Officer, which law prevents
this radiant stranger...

295
00:18:52,998 --> 00:18:55,523
...from finding the magical
in the mundane?

296
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:59,797
- MTA Code 1085.1, Section 5.
- Could you be more specific?

297
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,907
- Hey. Hey!
- Oh, there's a chase. We're in a chase.

298
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:06,635
Sir, grab my Lincoln stick.

299
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:07,836
Chase!

300
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:11,339
My mind is racing. My heart is pounding.

301
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:13,508
This is my first chase, and I love it.

302
00:19:14,586 --> 00:19:17,885
- Let me through, I'm a free spirit!
- West on 42nd.

303
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,253
This is what I live for!

304
00:19:20,425 --> 00:19:21,551
We've got a runner.

305
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:24,127
A chase is happening!
This is a genuine chase!

306
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:25,991
Oh! I'm... I...

307
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:30,659
- No, no, no.
- I was gonna go get my license.

308
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:33,532
You ran from me, Naomi.
Now I gotta take you in.

309
00:19:33,705 --> 00:19:36,697
Besides, you've had three warnings
for operating an illegal tour.

310
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:39,343
Except this isn't an illegal tour...

311
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:42,878
...because these people aren't tourists,
they're our family.

312
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:46,115
Yes. They are, they're my family.

313
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:48,344
That's my family.
We're having a family reunion.

314
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,853
Reunion. Uh, that, for example,
is Uncle Stuart waving there.

315
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:54,219
Yes. Oh, hey, Uncle Stuart.

316
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:57,419
Under that sun hat,
that's Caribbean Diane Keaton.

317
00:19:57,596 --> 00:20:00,064
- Yes, exactly.
- And also we have...

318
00:20:00,232 --> 00:20:02,462
Uncle Korean John Lennon.

319
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:05,301
And this is, uh, Abe Lincoln, I presume.

320
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:06,937
- Oh, no.
- No.

321
00:20:07,105 --> 00:20:12,042
- He is my admittedly eccentric...
- Fiancée. I'm her fiancée.

322
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,543
He is my fiancée.

323
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:18,149
Oh. Mm-hm.

324
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,317
Darling, you don't want
these people to think...

325
00:20:23,488 --> 00:20:26,218
...that you're some kind of
random British pervert.

326
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:30,555
No, I'm a very specific British pervert,
which is why you fell in love with me...

327
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:33,664
...from our first date.
Which was where, exactly?

328
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,091
Grand Central.

329
00:20:36,268 --> 00:20:38,998
You had your first date
at Grand Central Station.

330
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:43,733
It wasn't a shabby affair. I'd hired
out the entire place. It was deserted.

331
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:46,673
Acrobats were in the place,
put on quite a show for us.

332
00:20:46,878 --> 00:20:48,311
- Didn't they, Naomi?
- No, no.

333
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,675
The floor was strewn
with a million petals.

334
00:20:50,882 --> 00:20:53,442
Their scent hung in the air
like the sweet breath of angels.

335
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:56,087
And we forgot ourselves entirely.
Didn't we?

336
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,155
And ran nude through that concourse.

337
00:20:58,323 --> 00:21:00,848
No, no, we just...
We had clothes on and we ate.

338
00:21:01,026 --> 00:21:02,755
- What'd you eat?
- Oh.

339
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,327
Oh, what was that?

340
00:21:04,496 --> 00:21:05,963
- Pe...
- Pe... Pe... Pe...

341
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:07,155
PEZ.

342
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:09,425
Have any identification, Mr. Lincoln?

343
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:10,932
Actually, I do.

344
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:14,470
Um, here you go. I think you'll find that
should do the trick.

345
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,336
There's plenty more where that
came from, if you catch my drift, hmm?

346
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:20,034
Ah. You keep it, Arthur,
and thank you for the show.

347
00:21:21,713 --> 00:21:24,443
- Naomi, get a license. Good luck.
- Okay.

348
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:27,949
What was that? Who are you?

349
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:32,056
I'm just a ragged-trousered stranger
with a crazy hat.

350
00:21:32,224 --> 00:21:34,158
Oh, my God.

351
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:39,590
Arthur, your safari into the pointless
ends now. Get in the car.

352
00:21:39,765 --> 00:21:43,030
No. It's okay.
Uh, Hobson can't tell me what to do.

353
00:21:43,201 --> 00:21:46,693
Yes, I can. I work for his mother.
Get in the car. Bitterman, open the door.

354
00:21:48,006 --> 00:21:50,941
- Bitterman, close that door.
- Get in the car.

355
00:21:51,109 --> 00:21:53,009
- Not you, Bitterman.
- Yes, you, Bitterman.

356
00:21:53,178 --> 00:21:56,204
I'm sorry. Who are you people?

357
00:21:56,381 --> 00:21:57,712
I'm his nanny.

358
00:21:58,917 --> 00:22:00,214
I'm not, I'm Bitterman.

359
00:22:00,385 --> 00:22:04,719
Well, I have to get back to our confused
family over there, so have a nice day.

360
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:06,221
Oh, hang... Uh, excuse me.

361
00:22:07,025 --> 00:22:10,222
Naomi Quinn,
I'd like to see you again.

362
00:22:10,395 --> 00:22:13,831
- I don't date boys who have nannies.
- Very wise choice.

363
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:16,934
You're not the first woman
who walks the streets for a living...

364
00:22:17,102 --> 00:22:18,569
...that he's taken a liking to.

365
00:22:20,205 --> 00:22:21,570
Is she always with you?

366
00:22:24,042 --> 00:22:28,376
Okay. 917-176-2030.

367
00:22:28,547 --> 00:22:31,209
- Uh... Did you remember that?
- No.

368
00:22:37,756 --> 00:22:39,087
Arthur, get in the car.

369
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:45,261
I'm gonna get in the car now, but because
I want to, not because you have told me to.

370
00:22:45,597 --> 00:22:47,030
Distinction.

371
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:48,461
Bitterman.

372
00:22:49,067 --> 00:22:53,094
It was magical. We ran
from the police, then we lied to them.

373
00:22:53,271 --> 00:22:56,263
- Have you ever had days like that, Evander?
- I believe I have.

374
00:22:57,642 --> 00:23:01,874
Me and this girl are two perfectly matched
opponents, like you and Mike Tyson.

375
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:03,708
- She could be the one.
- Yes.

376
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:06,612
Oh. I'm so sorry. That went
right through your guard.

377
00:23:06,785 --> 00:23:08,946
- Are you okay?
- I'll make it.

378
00:23:09,121 --> 00:23:10,645
What I like about her, Naomi...

379
00:23:10,822 --> 00:23:13,382
...is she's got a very unique way
of seeing the world.

380
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:14,820
So do flies.

381
00:23:14,993 --> 00:23:18,793
This is a repeat of when you were certain
you needed a pet giraffe to be happy.

382
00:23:18,964 --> 00:23:22,456
- Well, you were bored after a week.
- Because he ate his monocle.

383
00:23:22,634 --> 00:23:24,932
The brute had no regard
for fashion, Evander.

384
00:23:25,103 --> 00:23:28,163
No, because you were from two
different worlds, the same as this girl.

385
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:31,537
Listen, could you just let me focus
on my jab and refresh me, please?

386
00:23:33,278 --> 00:23:36,338
- Aah! That's vodka in there.
- Refreshed?

387
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:40,942
No, but I think some of it probably went
in my bloodstream so it's not all bad news.

388
00:23:41,353 --> 00:23:43,412
- Get dressed.
- Why?

389
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:45,920
Because at 3:00
you're going to ask Burt Johnson...

390
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:48,025
...for his daughter's hand in marriage.

391
00:23:48,193 --> 00:23:51,526
I will do no such thing. I'm going to
remain here and box with Evander.

392
00:23:51,696 --> 00:23:54,824
And then I shall have my music lesson
with Kanye West as planned.

393
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,758
Out, now.

394
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:01,000
Make me.

395
00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:06,038
I'll just have a bit of fun with her.

396
00:24:06,211 --> 00:24:08,179
Use the old rope-a-dope,
I should think.

397
00:24:08,346 --> 00:24:11,543
- Stick and move, like you taught me.
- Arthur, after you're married...

398
00:24:11,716 --> 00:24:14,708
...you're going to have to stop this
obsession with random women.

399
00:24:14,886 --> 00:24:17,377
She is not a random woman,
she understands me.

400
00:24:17,556 --> 00:24:21,822
She laughs at my jokes. She's like you, but
with a more appropriate potential for sex.

401
00:24:24,396 --> 00:24:28,890
Ow! That really hurt. Evander,
you assured me I was indestructible.

402
00:24:29,067 --> 00:24:31,160
Burt Johnson, 3:00.

403
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:36,935
Evander, if he's not out of this ring in
one minute, I'll bite your other ear off.

404
00:24:55,193 --> 00:24:57,423
What am I doing here, Bitterman?

405
00:24:57,863 --> 00:25:00,991
Uh, you asked me to drive you
to the Burt Johnson Tower.

406
00:25:03,235 --> 00:25:06,102
- But if you were me...
- I would like that very much.

407
00:25:06,371 --> 00:25:08,202
That's very flattering.

408
00:25:08,373 --> 00:25:12,173
But if you were me
and you were in this situation...

409
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:14,539
...what would you do? What should I say?

410
00:25:14,713 --> 00:25:20,276
Uh, I'd go in there and say, um,
"Mr. Johnson, I like your tower.

411
00:25:21,586 --> 00:25:23,247
But I love your daughter."

412
00:25:23,421 --> 00:25:26,686
- But I don't love his daughter.
- Don't say that, because then he'll say no.

413
00:25:27,893 --> 00:25:29,292
You've been very helpful.

414
00:25:31,162 --> 00:25:33,426
Put this on. Wait here.

415
00:25:33,598 --> 00:25:35,691
It's the same as your one.

416
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:38,233
"BJ," I'll never get tired of that.

417
00:25:46,645 --> 00:25:48,704
Woo-hoo, Bitterman!

418
00:25:59,691 --> 00:26:01,989
Bloody hell.

419
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:04,091
It's an apocalyptic future.

420
00:26:04,262 --> 00:26:07,629
The Upper East Side lay
in absolute ruin.

421
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:09,960
The machines have taken over, as usual.

422
00:26:10,135 --> 00:26:12,000
Ah, malevolent toaster.

423
00:26:12,203 --> 00:26:15,104
Only one man can save civilization.

424
00:26:15,273 --> 00:26:18,106
And that man is Arthur Bach.

425
00:26:18,276 --> 00:26:20,244
Justice!

426
00:26:33,458 --> 00:26:34,482
Hello, Arthur.

427
00:26:34,659 --> 00:26:38,993
- Uh, sorry, I've never used...
- Never used what, Arthur?

428
00:26:39,164 --> 00:26:42,099
One of these guns what makes nails
come out of it.

429
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:46,601
Oh, the Grip-Rite GR 350.

430
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:48,630
It's a good gun.

431
00:26:48,807 --> 00:26:52,402
It's lovely, isn't it?
It's also one of my favorites.

432
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:55,709
Do you know you've got nails sticking
in you?

433
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:58,314
Framing nails.

434
00:26:58,683 --> 00:27:00,708
Standard.

435
00:27:02,053 --> 00:27:04,783
Well, I love what
you've done with the place, Burt.

436
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:07,982
It reminds me of a gay club
I went to once in Copenhagen.

437
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,457
This is gonna be my new office.

438
00:27:10,895 --> 00:27:12,920
Oh, my God. I live right over there.

439
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:17,765
I can see my living room, Burt.
That's interesting.

440
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:19,662
And frightening.

441
00:27:19,838 --> 00:27:23,831
Did you put this building here just
so you can spy on me?

442
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:25,374
Mm-hm.

443
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:29,010
Shouldn't you be getting
to the hospital?

444
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:34,379
If I ran off to the hospital every
time I got a little boo-boo...

445
00:27:34,552 --> 00:27:36,383
Yeah. What's a nail through the body?

446
00:27:36,554 --> 00:27:38,249
Made a hero out of Jesus.

447
00:27:38,423 --> 00:27:41,517
Uh, Burt, I'm starting to feel
a bit queasy.

448
00:27:41,693 --> 00:27:44,594
Let's cut the bullshit, Arthur.
I'm from Pittsburgh...

449
00:27:44,763 --> 00:27:46,856
...and now I own skyscrapers.

450
00:27:47,032 --> 00:27:49,557
Unlike you, I wasn't given my billions.

451
00:27:49,734 --> 00:27:51,634
I took them.

452
00:27:52,604 --> 00:27:53,662
But you know...

453
00:27:55,106 --> 00:28:00,738
...I'm actually fine
with my little girl marrying you.

454
00:28:01,212 --> 00:28:02,611
Do you know why?

455
00:28:02,781 --> 00:28:05,181
Because you've lost a lot of blood
and you're disoriented?

456
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:08,717
My little Susan can turn you around.

457
00:28:08,887 --> 00:28:13,517
You know, she once bought a crack house
and turned it into a condo.

458
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:16,058
That's funny,
I once did the exact opposite.

459
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:21,424
Now, you listen to me carefully. I need
to trust that you'll do what she says.

460
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:22,725
- Yes.
- Table saw.

461
00:28:24,102 --> 00:28:26,798
Most dangerous piece of equipment
on a job site.

462
00:28:26,971 --> 00:28:29,963
Hands five inches on either
side of the blade and you'll be fine.

463
00:28:30,141 --> 00:28:33,474
- No, I don't like things like this.
- Come on. You can do it.

464
00:28:33,645 --> 00:28:35,306
No... Just, uh... Just push it through.

465
00:28:40,085 --> 00:28:43,316
I did it, Burt! I did a man thing!
That was incredible.

466
00:28:43,488 --> 00:28:46,252
- Let's saw something else in half.
- How about your finger?

467
00:28:46,791 --> 00:28:47,917
My finger?

468
00:28:48,093 --> 00:28:52,257
It's okay, the saw has a safety
device. It detects moisture.

469
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:56,992
Anything containing moisture touches
that blade, and bam, it'll stop.

470
00:28:57,168 --> 00:28:59,568
That sounds a little bit risky
to me, Burt.

471
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:01,069
Use your tongue.

472
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:04,431
- My tongue?
- Plenty of moisture in your tongue.

473
00:29:04,609 --> 00:29:06,941
Oh, no. I don't think
I should do that, Burt.

474
00:29:07,112 --> 00:29:10,479
I think I'd like to go back over there
now to house.

475
00:29:10,648 --> 00:29:13,014
- No, Burt! What are you doing?
- Lick the saw!

476
00:29:13,184 --> 00:29:15,778
No, Burt.
You've taken leave of your senses.

477
00:29:15,954 --> 00:29:18,479
You need to stick out your tongue
or it won't sense the moisture.

478
00:29:19,858 --> 00:29:21,450
I want my nanny.

479
00:29:44,048 --> 00:29:47,984
Mr. Johnson,
a very wise man once said:

480
00:29:48,153 --> 00:29:52,613
"I like your tower,
but I love your daughter."

481
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:54,452
Can I marry her, please?

482
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:56,787
Sure.

483
00:29:59,831 --> 00:30:02,629
- Pascal, I'm gonna have the veal.
- Excellent choice.

484
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:05,964
Could you tell Jerome, please,
that it was a little dry last time?

485
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:07,570
- I will see to it.
- Thank you.

486
00:30:07,739 --> 00:30:11,470
- For you, sir?
- Just a caldron of tequila and a spoon.

487
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:16,003
I hear you have something to ask me.

488
00:30:16,181 --> 00:30:18,012
Yeah, I do, as a matter of fact, Susan.

489
00:30:18,183 --> 00:30:20,981
Would you mind telling me what
the bloody hell's been going on?

490
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:24,019
We're having a magical night.
I don't understand.

491
00:30:24,189 --> 00:30:26,817
You don't understand
that there's a macabre conspiracy...

492
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:29,585
...to inveigle me into a loveless marriage.
Susan, we...

493
00:30:29,761 --> 00:30:32,025
- "Loveless marriage."
- We should not get married.

494
00:30:32,197 --> 00:30:34,427
We don't have anything in common,
do we?

495
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:39,059
I mean, we don't like the same food.
Veal? I think that's really cruel.

496
00:30:39,237 --> 00:30:41,102
Do you like it because it's cruel?

497
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:44,367
We don't like the same people, music.

498
00:30:44,542 --> 00:30:46,339
You love horses.

499
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:48,069
- I do.
- I don't trust them.

500
00:30:48,246 --> 00:30:50,407
- Think about this.
- Their eyes, their sneaky feet.

501
00:30:50,582 --> 00:30:54,040
- This is a business... Stay with me.
- Their shoes are permanent.

502
00:30:54,219 --> 00:30:57,086
- All you have to do...
- Who makes that commitment to a shoe?

503
00:30:57,255 --> 00:31:01,248
- Most marriages devolve eventually.
- Mean faces.

504
00:31:02,627 --> 00:31:04,458
This is all it is,
it's a business partnership.

505
00:31:04,629 --> 00:31:07,598
With the added benefit of attraction.

506
00:31:08,433 --> 00:31:12,733
Undeniably, you have got something
dark and twisted in you.

507
00:31:12,904 --> 00:31:16,362
And for awhile,
I thought I might be able to bugger it out.

508
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:19,305
But I tried really hard
and I think it's still in there.

509
00:31:19,477 --> 00:31:22,469
Reach into your pocket, pull out the ring,
and say four little words.

510
00:31:22,647 --> 00:31:25,275
Okay. Uh, I don't love you.

511
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:26,542
Try again.

512
00:31:27,285 --> 00:31:28,650
I like other girls.

513
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:33,052
- Oh, well, me too. Let's invite one over.
- I'll embarrass you. Daily.

514
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:36,921
For example, look, I'm quite capable
of this kind of conduct.

515
00:31:37,095 --> 00:31:38,119
I've seen it before.

516
00:31:39,497 --> 00:31:40,555
All right. Yes.

517
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:45,392
That's just part of my repertoire.
By thunder, here's a pretty dame.

518
00:31:49,173 --> 00:31:52,939
There. Hmm? What do you think
about that? She's probably pregnant.

519
00:31:53,311 --> 00:31:55,905
- Well done. Go on.
- Okay.

520
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:58,177
Where's the kitchen?
I'm going to the kitchen.

521
00:31:58,349 --> 00:31:59,941
- Coming in the kitchen.
- Isn't he mad?

522
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:02,650
I'm a naughty robot.

523
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,947
- But I just love him.
- I've got tin titties.

524
00:32:05,123 --> 00:32:08,991
This is what you're doing to me.
This is how I feel.

525
00:32:10,361 --> 00:32:13,125
- I think this sausage is cooked.
- Pascal, drinks, for everyone.

526
00:32:13,298 --> 00:32:16,495
I'll tell you what, it's a lot more fun
in that bloody kitchen.

527
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:21,034
Daddy did, uh, show you
his little table saw, didn't he?

528
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:28,303
Turn around and tell everyone you're
crazy when you're in love. Ready? Go.

529
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:33,307
I don't know why I did all of those things
just then. I go crazy when I'm in love.

530
00:32:36,854 --> 00:32:37,946
Sit down. Great.

531
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:39,987
Help me. Help me.

532
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:46,593
Embarrassing me or your family is the
one thing that will not be tolerated.

533
00:32:46,764 --> 00:32:48,561
- Is that clear?
- Yes, please.

534
00:32:48,733 --> 00:32:53,727
Sweet boy, this can all be
a ton of fun if you let it.

535
00:32:59,043 --> 00:33:00,340
Shall we try again?

536
00:33:02,513 --> 00:33:06,313
On one knee. I'm just an old-fashioned girl.
Just go ahead.

537
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:10,886
Susan. Pfft.

538
00:33:11,055 --> 00:33:14,047
- Are you sure about this?
- You're running from yourself, Arthur.

539
00:33:14,525 --> 00:33:16,823
I wish I was,
because I'd let me get away.

540
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:18,758
Ask me. Ask me.

541
00:33:19,697 --> 00:33:21,096
Have it. Go on.

542
00:33:21,566 --> 00:33:22,828
Yes, Arthur.

543
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:26,127
Madames et monsieurs, the happy couple.

544
00:33:32,944 --> 00:33:34,434
Ah!

545
00:33:58,102 --> 00:33:59,296
Aspirin.

546
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:03,340
Give me the whole bottle.
My life's over.

547
00:34:03,508 --> 00:34:06,568
You're gonna be looked after
and you're gonna stay fabulously rich.

548
00:34:06,744 --> 00:34:11,613
Maybe I'd rather be fabulously poor.
Some poor people I see look really happy.

549
00:34:11,783 --> 00:34:14,650
That's because they're far away
or you've given them money.

550
00:34:15,787 --> 00:34:17,584
What do you know, Alfred?

551
00:34:18,456 --> 00:34:21,721
Arthur, poor people have to work.

552
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:25,989
They have to stand in the rain waiting for
buses to take them to things called jobs...

553
00:34:26,164 --> 00:34:29,327
...which they have to do all year round
for holidays away from those jobs.

554
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:34,301
Don't patronize me, Snobson.
I know what a jobs are.

555
00:34:34,472 --> 00:34:35,996
I model riding boots, don't I?

556
00:34:36,641 --> 00:34:41,476
Posing in riding boots for another pampered
prick is not a job. Now take your vitamin.

557
00:34:50,021 --> 00:34:52,421
- I erased her number.
- Hobson, I have to see her.

558
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:54,649
We'll unravel
this engagement bollocks later.

559
00:34:54,826 --> 00:34:58,853
Arthur, you made the choice.
An engagement is a promise.

560
00:34:59,831 --> 00:35:01,731
Be a man.

561
00:35:11,843 --> 00:35:14,471
Continuing on,
this is Grand Central Terminal...

562
00:35:14,645 --> 00:35:18,775
...and it is home to more
than 750,000 commuters a day.

563
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:21,942
Boring. What a tiresome fact that was.

564
00:35:22,386 --> 00:35:26,789
Oh, ladies and gentlemen, this is a
classic New York architectural feature:

565
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:29,324
The man who takes your number
and then never calls you.

566
00:35:29,494 --> 00:35:30,518
Ooh.

567
00:35:30,695 --> 00:35:33,163
- I'm bored too.
- Yeah, he's bored, I'm bored...

568
00:35:33,331 --> 00:35:37,700
...the whole tour is really bored.
Come on, liven it up, lady.

569
00:35:37,869 --> 00:35:39,393
Okay, well, what about this:

570
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:41,538
See that clock up there?
See those statues?

571
00:35:41,706 --> 00:35:44,834
That's Jupiter and Minerva
and Hercules.

572
00:35:45,009 --> 00:35:47,876
When the clock strikes 12,
they reach down and they stop time.

573
00:35:48,045 --> 00:35:51,913
And then they go out on the town. They go
swim in the Hudson and cavort at the zoo.

574
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:55,382
- Sometimes they even go to a strip club.
- Oh, okay.

575
00:35:55,553 --> 00:35:57,418
Okay, guys,
that's the end of your tour. Um...

576
00:35:57,588 --> 00:36:01,183
Your complimentary pretzel awaits.
It's only $5.

577
00:36:03,094 --> 00:36:05,153
- Wow, you look really, really amazing.
- Okay.

578
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:07,297
- I've got something to show you.
- I don't...

579
00:36:07,465 --> 00:36:09,126
We're on a tight schedule. Come.

580
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,426
- Okay.
- Stop thinking.

581
00:36:16,641 --> 00:36:19,906
Um, Arthur, there are no people.
Where are the people?

582
00:36:20,077 --> 00:36:24,343
The people have been rerouted
for 45 minutes by me for you.

583
00:36:25,416 --> 00:36:30,649
It's sort of romantic, but in another way,
it's incredibly selfish of you.

584
00:36:32,256 --> 00:36:34,315
Grand Central.

585
00:36:35,326 --> 00:36:37,624
Rose petals.

586
00:36:37,795 --> 00:36:40,389
Dinner. Oh, my God.

587
00:36:43,234 --> 00:36:44,861
This is our first date.

588
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:48,870
Oh, is that what we said to the police
officer? I'd quite forgotten.

589
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:51,864
Wait, I'm not getting naked.

590
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:55,774
Don't rule it out at this stage, it takes
some of the pizzazz out of the evening.

591
00:36:55,947 --> 00:36:57,972
It's like we're the last people
on the planet.

592
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:02,948
Wow, this is amazing. Thank you.

593
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:13,022
- There's a waiter on that escalator.
- Shh.

594
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:15,490
He's in formal attire.

595
00:37:15,967 --> 00:37:17,901
- He's carrying a platter.
- Wait for it.

596
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,605
Excellent.

597
00:37:29,347 --> 00:37:31,941
- Your dinner, madam.
- Thank you.

598
00:37:33,017 --> 00:37:34,985
PEZ.

599
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:40,823
These are us as PEZ heads? Ha, ha.

600
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:43,358
You're the cute one.
Well, the cuter one.

601
00:37:43,527 --> 00:37:44,687
Do you want me?

602
00:37:44,862 --> 00:37:46,159
- Thank you.
- Ha, ha.

603
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:49,762
Hey, you know, as soon as I saw you...

604
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:52,869
...I knew I wanted to eat candy bricks
out of your neck hole.

605
00:37:53,037 --> 00:37:54,129
You're not the first.

606
00:37:55,706 --> 00:37:58,197
What do you think? Do you like it?

607
00:37:58,476 --> 00:38:01,445
Well, on my last date...

608
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:05,673
...the guy told me that I could only
eat salad and then he said he was gay.

609
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:06,976
- This is better.
- Yeah.

610
00:38:07,151 --> 00:38:08,880
I mean, I'm heterosexual, so...

611
00:38:09,053 --> 00:38:10,077
Oh, already winning.

612
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:14,049
Did you know that the zodiac
is painted on backwards?

613
00:38:14,225 --> 00:38:18,218
It was a goof by the artist, but then the
Vanderbilts, who commissioned the place...

614
00:38:18,396 --> 00:38:20,762
...said that it was God's view
of the heavens.

615
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:23,365
Trust the Vanderbilts to see the world
from God's perspective.

616
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:27,164
There's a woman jumping behind you.

617
00:38:27,505 --> 00:38:30,406
Oh, yeah. I promised you acrobats.

618
00:38:34,111 --> 00:38:36,978
Arthur, this is... This is insane.

619
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:39,548
Yeah, this is what money is for.

620
00:38:39,717 --> 00:38:45,246
Creating excitement and joy
and acrobats and PEZ heads and...

621
00:38:46,524 --> 00:38:47,582
Italy.

622
00:38:47,925 --> 00:38:49,688
- What?
- Let's go to Italy.

623
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:52,328
Okay, let's go.
When do you wanna go to Italy?

624
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:58,696
- Tonight. I'll charter a jet. Giuseppe, hi.
- I can't go to Italy with you tonight.

625
00:38:59,103 --> 00:39:00,832
Excuse me.

626
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:02,063
- Naomi...
- Mm-hm?

627
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:04,139
...I'm talking about Tuscany.

628
00:39:04,308 --> 00:39:08,108
White truffle gelato. Have you ever
tasted white truffle gelato?

629
00:39:08,279 --> 00:39:10,440
It makes all other gelato
taste like shit.

630
00:39:10,614 --> 00:39:15,074
Arthur, you emptied out
Grand Central Station.

631
00:39:16,787 --> 00:39:18,687
Can't you just be here?

632
00:39:22,727 --> 00:39:24,388
Can I show you something?

633
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:28,455
After we moved to New York
when I was 11...

634
00:39:28,632 --> 00:39:30,930
...my mom used to bring me down here
all the time.

635
00:39:31,102 --> 00:39:34,071
We'd take the train in from Queens.

636
00:39:34,238 --> 00:39:37,935
This is the Whisper Wall.
It's a really special place.

637
00:39:38,109 --> 00:39:41,670
Okay, you have to go in that corner,
and I'll be over here.

638
00:39:41,846 --> 00:39:43,939
And say something.

639
00:39:44,115 --> 00:39:45,275
What?

640
00:39:45,649 --> 00:39:46,877
I don't know, anything.

641
00:39:47,184 --> 00:39:51,951
Oh, you could call me up and ask me out,
like you failed to do.

642
00:39:52,923 --> 00:39:54,823
Good idea.

643
00:39:57,995 --> 00:40:01,260
Hello, this is Arthur.
Is Naomi there, please?

644
00:40:01,432 --> 00:40:03,559
Yes, this is Naomi.

645
00:40:03,868 --> 00:40:07,668
My God, that's amazing. You're over there,
but I can hear you perfectly over here.

646
00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:10,306
- It's acoustics.
- Wow.

647
00:40:10,708 --> 00:40:12,107
I'm gonna buy one of these.

648
00:40:12,476 --> 00:40:15,001
You don't have to buy it, it's free.

649
00:40:15,346 --> 00:40:17,177
Incredible.

650
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:20,243
I was just having a phone call,
so I've gotta go back.

651
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:21,680
Oh.

652
00:40:22,987 --> 00:40:28,323
If you're, um, not too busy, would you like
to maybe go on a date with me?

653
00:40:30,828 --> 00:40:35,322
Actually, I'm free right now
if you'd like to do something simple.

654
00:40:35,499 --> 00:40:37,592
Food, my house?

655
00:40:47,878 --> 00:40:49,106
What is this, please?

656
00:40:50,014 --> 00:40:54,314
- Oh, this is, um, generic brand Saucy-Os.
- Saucy-Os.

657
00:40:54,485 --> 00:40:59,787
Yeah. It's one of the few times the generic
brand's actually better than the real thing.

658
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:02,323
Something happens in the factory.

659
00:41:04,161 --> 00:41:05,355
It's delicious.

660
00:41:05,529 --> 00:41:07,224
Welcome to the life of humans.

661
00:41:07,398 --> 00:41:09,764
It is the culinary success of the season.

662
00:41:11,435 --> 00:41:12,993
- Mademoiselle, you are...
- Shh. Shh. Shh.

663
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:15,297
- What?
- My dad is asleep.

664
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:18,067
But your mum wears earplugs,
so we don't need to worry about her.

665
00:41:18,242 --> 00:41:21,177
My mom doesn't wear anything anymore.

666
00:41:21,345 --> 00:41:23,870
Naked. Sleeping au naturel.

667
00:41:24,048 --> 00:41:25,413
She's dead.

668
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:28,175
I'm so sorry.

669
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:31,347
She died, um, last year.

670
00:41:31,522 --> 00:41:35,652
It's really recent, and I made a joke about
your dead nude mum. I'm so sorry, Naomi.

671
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:39,489
- No, no, no, really, it's okay.
- I'm always doing things like that.

672
00:41:40,064 --> 00:41:44,228
If it's any consolation,
my dad is similarly deceased.

673
00:41:44,401 --> 00:41:46,198
I'm so sorry. Was that recent?

674
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:50,329
No, it was when I was a child,
so you've won that round, but, uh...

675
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:52,339
- Point, Naomi.
- Right, well done.

676
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:55,274
You're winning,
but it's not too late for me to run home...

677
00:41:55,446 --> 00:41:57,971
...and butcher my mother
just to edge into the lead.

678
00:41:58,148 --> 00:42:00,446
Uh, no. My dad died when I was a kid.

679
00:42:00,618 --> 00:42:04,611
He was by all accounts a very
sensible, uh, frugal man...

680
00:42:04,788 --> 00:42:07,052
...who didn't drink, didn't smoke,
walked everywhere.

681
00:42:07,224 --> 00:42:08,248
Hmm.

682
00:42:08,425 --> 00:42:11,622
Dropped dead of a heart attack
when he was 44.

683
00:42:11,795 --> 00:42:14,491
Lesson being,
why bother taking care of yourself?

684
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:16,632
- Cheers.
- I don't think that's the lesson.

685
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,358
- It's the lesson I learned.
- Cheers.

686
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:19,560
Mm.

687
00:42:21,805 --> 00:42:23,102
Ah.

688
00:42:23,274 --> 00:42:24,901
No, thanks.

689
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:27,142
What were you like as a kid?

690
00:42:27,311 --> 00:42:30,576
Well, ha, ha, aside from being
grief-stricken...

691
00:42:30,748 --> 00:42:33,512
- Ha, ha, yes.
- I was kind of little...

692
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:35,582
...and I didn't drink so much then.

693
00:42:35,753 --> 00:42:38,984
What about you?
Did you drink much as a child?

694
00:42:39,156 --> 00:42:40,384
Strictly juice boxes.

695
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:42,526
- What a weirdo.
- I was a weirdo.

696
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:44,853
I thought that the moon
followed me everywhere.

697
00:42:45,029 --> 00:42:47,122
I thought it meant something special
was gonna happen.

698
00:42:47,498 --> 00:42:50,331
Well, that's a pretty
ridiculous hypotheses, Naomi...

699
00:42:50,501 --> 00:42:53,834
...because by that notion,
the moon would be out there right n...

700
00:42:55,205 --> 00:42:58,663
Naomi, the moon is literally out there
right now spying on us...

701
00:42:58,842 --> 00:43:02,608
...his light shining down on your face
and clutter.

702
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:04,372
What is all these things?

703
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:07,912
- My dad's pills.
- Hmm.

704
00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:12,546
Got a lot of incriminating stuff lying
around in here young la... What's this for?

705
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:14,451
- That's nothing. That's...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

706
00:43:14,625 --> 00:43:17,185
This is not nothing. This is something.

707
00:43:18,862 --> 00:43:22,229
I used to write stories
and draw pictures for kids.

708
00:43:22,399 --> 00:43:23,423
Ah.

709
00:43:24,168 --> 00:43:25,192
Wow.

710
00:43:25,369 --> 00:43:28,463
"The Statue of Liberty had traveled
all the way from France.

711
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:32,632
She missed her friend,
the Eiffel Tower, and her arm hurt."

712
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:35,335
- Naomi, that's wonderful.
- Thank you.

713
00:43:35,512 --> 00:43:38,970
In this, the Statue of Liberty
is a lonely French giant.

714
00:43:39,383 --> 00:43:43,979
Yeah. And she stays lonely until she
meets her friend, the Chrysler Building.

715
00:43:44,822 --> 00:43:46,153
That's brilliant, Naomi.

716
00:43:47,524 --> 00:43:51,187
You should quit your job
and focus all your energy on this.

717
00:43:51,362 --> 00:43:53,262
- I can't.
- Why? What have you got to lose?

718
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:55,159
The house and electricity and...

719
00:43:55,332 --> 00:43:58,062
You can pay for all those things
when this is published.

720
00:43:59,036 --> 00:44:03,496
Arthur, things like that don't happen
to people like me.

721
00:44:04,208 --> 00:44:06,676
Then why is the moon
still following you?

722
00:44:11,348 --> 00:44:13,475
But this doesn't wake your father?

723
00:44:14,084 --> 00:44:18,077
- He's used to this.
- This could wake my father.

724
00:44:18,255 --> 00:44:19,279
From his grave.

725
00:44:21,892 --> 00:44:24,122
Okay, lovely, but a little closer together.

726
00:44:24,294 --> 00:44:26,888
All right. Smile, Daddy, smile.

727
00:44:27,197 --> 00:44:29,529
Okay, and now,
I'd love to see some more love.

728
00:44:32,069 --> 00:44:33,593
What is this?

729
00:44:33,771 --> 00:44:35,739
Your engagement photo
for Town & Country.

730
00:44:35,906 --> 00:44:37,771
How about a couple
of you and your mum?

731
00:44:38,108 --> 00:44:39,598
Oh, all right, yeah. Okay.

732
00:44:39,777 --> 00:44:41,210
All right.

733
00:44:41,779 --> 00:44:43,770
- Vivienne?
- Yes, Arthur?

734
00:44:43,947 --> 00:44:45,244
If hypothetically...

735
00:44:45,416 --> 00:44:49,750
...uh, I was to develop feelings
for a woman who isn't exactly Susan...

736
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:53,117
...kind of an un-Susan, an anti-Susan,
as it were...

737
00:44:53,290 --> 00:44:56,885
...um, how would that make you feel,
hypothetically?

738
00:44:57,061 --> 00:44:59,825
Hypothetically, I'd say congratulations.

739
00:44:59,997 --> 00:45:02,397
But unfortunately,
the most magical relationships...

740
00:45:02,566 --> 00:45:04,796
...will wilt in the midst
of grinding poverty.

741
00:45:04,968 --> 00:45:07,266
Wonderful.
Arthur, how about a few of you...

742
00:45:07,438 --> 00:45:09,429
...and your future father-in-law?
- What? No, no.

743
00:45:09,606 --> 00:45:11,403
- Ha, ha. Hello, Burt.
- Hello.

744
00:45:13,444 --> 00:45:15,742
I'll never get used to
that handshake.

745
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:18,113
Where were you last night, Arthur?

746
00:45:18,282 --> 00:45:19,647
What? Just at home. Home.

747
00:45:19,817 --> 00:45:21,444
You sure about that?

748
00:45:21,618 --> 00:45:23,415
- Yes.
- My turn, Daddy.

749
00:45:23,587 --> 00:45:25,248
- Oh, Jesus.
- Oh, great.

750
00:45:25,422 --> 00:45:28,823
This is for the cover shot.
I need the bride and the groom, please.

751
00:45:28,992 --> 00:45:30,289
Get on the horse, Arthur.

752
00:45:30,461 --> 00:45:33,487
I love animals, but I don't trust you.

753
00:45:33,664 --> 00:45:34,790
Get on the horse.

754
00:45:35,432 --> 00:45:37,662
You will not make me cry today.

755
00:45:37,835 --> 00:45:41,771
For the riding boot shoots, we use
a stuffed horse or sometimes a girl.

756
00:45:41,939 --> 00:45:43,839
- Maybe Daddy could help?
- Yeah, let me help.

757
00:45:44,007 --> 00:45:45,907
- No, it's all right, Burt.
- Help him up.

758
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:49,045
You're a weak man, Burt. Burt.
No, Burt, you're... That doesn't help.

759
00:45:49,213 --> 00:45:52,080
Ow! Oh, my God.
Burt, you're not qualified.

760
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:53,876
Aah! Ha, ha.

761
00:45:54,051 --> 00:45:56,019
That was no trouble. That was no tr...

762
00:45:56,186 --> 00:45:59,246
What a lot of fuss.
What a lot of fuss about nothing.

763
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:00,947
Okay, lovely.

764
00:46:01,325 --> 00:46:03,020
Who is she, Arthur?

765
00:46:03,694 --> 00:46:06,891
I don't know, I imagine she's called
Trixy or Rocket. Something like that.

766
00:46:07,064 --> 00:46:09,032
Not the horse. The girl.

767
00:46:09,199 --> 00:46:11,064
I don't know what you mean.

768
00:46:11,235 --> 00:46:13,100
We'll be right back. Excuse us.

769
00:46:14,571 --> 00:46:16,505
Wha...? Aah! I didn't agree to this.

770
00:46:16,673 --> 00:46:19,141
First your father, now the horse.

771
00:46:19,309 --> 00:46:22,005
When will my testicles get some rest?

772
00:46:22,312 --> 00:46:26,840
Delaying a hundred commuter trains
for a secret date wasn't the smartest move.

773
00:46:27,017 --> 00:46:28,780
It was in The Times and the Post.

774
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:32,410
I must've hurt you with that. I understand
if you wanna cancel the wedding.

775
00:46:32,589 --> 00:46:36,184
We're not gonna cancel the wedding.
It's happening as scheduled. End of story.

776
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:40,621
Are those gonna be your vows?
"To death do us part, as scheduled"?

777
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:44,666
Listen, Susan, is this about money?
I've got news for you, you're already rich.

778
00:46:45,002 --> 00:46:48,699
I'm not you rich, Arthur.
My family doesn't have a coat of arms.

779
00:46:48,872 --> 00:46:51,432
I'll draw you one. It's quite simple.
It's usually just a sword.

780
00:46:51,608 --> 00:46:53,166
I hear them whisper at functions.

781
00:46:53,343 --> 00:46:56,540
In their eyes, I'm just the daughter
of a contractor from Pittsburgh.

782
00:46:56,713 --> 00:46:57,839
They sneer when I walk past.

783
00:46:58,015 --> 00:47:00,984
That's probably just because
of who you are as a person.

784
00:47:06,557 --> 00:47:09,355
Bach Worldwide has been run
by a Bach for generations.

785
00:47:09,693 --> 00:47:13,094
Susan Johnson-Bach will be in control
of one of the largest trusts in the world.

786
00:47:13,263 --> 00:47:16,391
You're not gonna get in my way.
Say goodbye to your little girlfriend.

787
00:47:16,567 --> 00:47:20,526
But Vivienne. Susienne. Satan. Susan.
I like this girl.

788
00:47:20,704 --> 00:47:24,265
We connect, she and I.
She's spontaneous and...

789
00:47:24,441 --> 00:47:26,102
I'm spontaneous.

790
00:47:26,276 --> 00:47:29,211
Really? You planned to confront me
during a contrived photo shoot...

791
00:47:29,379 --> 00:47:31,540
...wearing an outfit you selected
when you were a child.

792
00:47:31,715 --> 00:47:32,739
Ow!

793
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:35,382
Okay, lovebirds, are you ready?

794
00:47:35,552 --> 00:47:38,248
Don't forget, it's all about the eyes.
Those happy eyes.

795
00:47:38,422 --> 00:47:39,548
You embarrassed me.

796
00:47:39,723 --> 00:47:41,554
Embarrass me again
and my father will cut off...

797
00:47:41,725 --> 00:47:42,783
I know, my tongue.

798
00:47:42,993 --> 00:47:44,585
No, your balls.

799
00:47:44,928 --> 00:47:46,293
Not if I keep them moist.

800
00:47:53,136 --> 00:47:54,899
Thoughts, Hobnobs?

801
00:47:55,072 --> 00:47:58,530
I think you're engaged, and going out
with Naomi is a really bad idea.

802
00:47:58,709 --> 00:47:59,733
Exactly.

803
00:48:01,111 --> 00:48:04,308
Which is why I've invited her here.

804
00:48:06,450 --> 00:48:07,917
Arthur, think.

805
00:48:08,085 --> 00:48:11,714
I have thinked. And that is why we're
all gonna hang out together.

806
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:14,790
I've never hung out in my life.
I'm not gonna start tonight.

807
00:48:14,958 --> 00:48:17,756
Hobson, if you get to know this girl,
you're gonna love her.

808
00:48:17,928 --> 00:48:20,260
Arthur, you must tell Naomi
you're getting married.

809
00:48:20,430 --> 00:48:23,593
You don't think that might rather
mar the romance of the evening?

810
00:48:24,101 --> 00:48:25,125
Hello, Arthur.

811
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:30,470
- Hi, Hobson.
- Hello, Susan. How nice to see you.

812
00:48:30,641 --> 00:48:32,734
Can you just give us one
little minute?

813
00:48:34,177 --> 00:48:36,304
Yes, of course.

814
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:38,607
Thank you.

815
00:48:41,218 --> 00:48:42,776
Mm-mm.

816
00:48:44,121 --> 00:48:46,453
- What was that?
- A French kiss.

817
00:48:46,623 --> 00:48:48,614
Really? Because the French
always surrender.

818
00:48:48,792 --> 00:48:50,259
That was decidedly German.

819
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:52,486
I was just at home
feeling spontaneous.

820
00:48:52,996 --> 00:48:55,464
I decided to put on
a little something spontaneous...

821
00:48:55,632 --> 00:48:58,567
...and come over here spontaneously.

822
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:02,569
Susan, mentally ill people are spontaneous.
It's all about context.

823
00:49:06,076 --> 00:49:11,810
Oh, good, this is happening now.
Shall we go to the bedroom?

824
00:49:11,982 --> 00:49:13,279
- You're a bit drunk.
- Okay.

825
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:15,850
So you just, uh... You wait here. Oh, no.

826
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:19,188
Oh-ho. Lovely. That's come off.

827
00:49:19,356 --> 00:49:22,382
- Um, I'm gonna get ice.
- What do you have in mind?

828
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:25,255
Uh, I imagine there'll be some injuries.
It'll reduce the swelling.

829
00:49:25,429 --> 00:49:26,896
Hurry.

830
00:49:29,733 --> 00:49:31,724
Naomi, I'm very happy to see you.

831
00:49:31,902 --> 00:49:33,028
- You are?
- Um...

832
00:49:34,671 --> 00:49:36,366
Naomi, I'm so glad you're here.

833
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:39,873
Um, did you kill Minnie Mouse
or did she surrender her dress willingly?

834
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:43,010
If it makes you feel better,
she didn't suffer.

835
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:46,215
Well, this is all very nice.
Come in, Naomi. Come in.

836
00:49:46,383 --> 00:49:48,351
Now, I know we were gonna
have a night in...

837
00:49:48,518 --> 00:49:51,453
- I can see why.
- But, actually, why don't we...?

838
00:49:51,621 --> 00:49:53,885
- This is amazing.
- Uh, no. Um...

839
00:49:54,057 --> 00:49:56,651
- That fish looks like a cat.
- Naomi. No, it doesn't.

840
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:59,057
- Wow, bubblegum rocket.
- Don't look at that.

841
00:49:59,229 --> 00:50:01,925
Now, tell me where the room
filled with buckets of gold is.

842
00:50:02,099 --> 00:50:04,431
It's over here,
away from the bedroom, actually.

843
00:50:04,601 --> 00:50:07,001
You have a glittery camel. Why?

844
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:08,899
They're 10 a penny in England.
Ignore that.

845
00:50:09,072 --> 00:50:13,941
Naomi, let me give you a full tour of the
apartment while Arthur primps himself.

846
00:50:14,111 --> 00:50:16,272
I'll be primping. I've gotta primp.

847
00:50:16,446 --> 00:50:19,381
- Oh, that's you.
- Yes, thank you.

848
00:50:20,450 --> 00:50:23,317
Ah, Susan.

849
00:50:25,088 --> 00:50:26,919
You're posing suggestively.

850
00:50:27,090 --> 00:50:29,615
Do you like it, my fiancé?

851
00:50:30,727 --> 00:50:31,751
Buckets of gold?

852
00:50:31,928 --> 00:50:34,419
Broken lunar module.
Silly bugger drove it down the stairs.

853
00:50:34,598 --> 00:50:38,398
Come through here. This should keep your
eyes off the valuables for a few minutes.

854
00:50:39,770 --> 00:50:42,034
Get out.

855
00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:45,663
Oh, I love Looney Tunes.

856
00:50:45,842 --> 00:50:47,104
Are these always playing?

857
00:50:47,434 --> 00:50:50,994
No, it, uh, alternates between this
and historical documentaries.

858
00:50:51,437 --> 00:50:54,736
- Really?
- No. Just this.

859
00:50:54,907 --> 00:50:59,435
Okay, I just have
to get the perfect place.

860
00:51:01,013 --> 00:51:02,310
Yes.

861
00:51:02,481 --> 00:51:04,711
Your friend will be with you shortly.

862
00:51:04,883 --> 00:51:08,148
Thank you. Oh, wait, don't you wanna stay?
This is a really good one.

863
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:11,948
Pepé tries to kiss Penelope Pussycat,
but then he falls off the boat.

864
00:51:12,123 --> 00:51:14,091
You forgot to say "spoiler alert."

865
00:51:14,258 --> 00:51:19,696
You are my peanut and I am your brittle.

866
00:51:20,631 --> 00:51:23,429
- Ooh.
- I'm Susan Johnson, your fiancée.

867
00:51:25,002 --> 00:51:26,799
- That's the problem, actually.
- Come on.

868
00:51:26,971 --> 00:51:29,439
No. I'm getting up here,
but this is not complicité.

869
00:51:29,607 --> 00:51:32,507
- I'm just helping you to get dressed.
- Saving yourself for marriage?

870
00:51:32,676 --> 00:51:34,041
More the divorce, to be honest.

871
00:51:35,412 --> 00:51:36,436
Susan, my buttons.

872
00:51:37,814 --> 00:51:39,372
How much have you had to drink?

873
00:51:40,817 --> 00:51:44,548
- Glasses? Bottles. Okay.
- Ha, ha.

874
00:51:44,721 --> 00:51:47,315
We are now in an area of my expertise.

875
00:51:47,491 --> 00:51:50,891
You are very drunk.
You need to sleep it off.

876
00:51:51,060 --> 00:51:54,427
- Close that. That's good. Good. Don't...
- Oh, that's... That's nice.

877
00:51:54,597 --> 00:51:56,531
- Try not to speak any words.
- Mm-hm.

878
00:51:57,900 --> 00:51:58,924
Shh. Shut up.

879
00:52:00,302 --> 00:52:04,705
No, you're not a sexy cat.
You're not a sexy cat. Stop that.

880
00:52:04,874 --> 00:52:06,705
I'm a bad kitty.

881
00:52:06,876 --> 00:52:09,344
You're not a bad kitty,
you're a sleepy lunatic.

882
00:52:09,512 --> 00:52:13,743
I'm a bad kitty.
I need to have my whiskers licked.

883
00:52:13,915 --> 00:52:16,315
There are no circumstances under which
I'd do that to a cat.

884
00:52:17,685 --> 00:52:20,085
Go to sleep.
That's enough of that. Stop it. Get... Ow!

885
00:52:21,456 --> 00:52:23,583
No! Unh. Ow!

886
00:52:27,829 --> 00:52:29,921
So this must be a fun job.

887
00:52:30,497 --> 00:52:32,624
Yes, it has its moments.

888
00:52:32,833 --> 00:52:36,667
Like trying to protect Arthur
from people with dubious intentions.

889
00:52:36,837 --> 00:52:37,963
Hmm.

890
00:52:40,941 --> 00:52:43,409
Oh, you mean me.

891
00:52:43,577 --> 00:52:46,740
Because I'm totally after the money,
if that's what you're thinking.

892
00:52:46,914 --> 00:52:49,780
How is the illegal
tour guide business going?

893
00:52:50,283 --> 00:52:51,875
Feeds my dad.

894
00:52:52,552 --> 00:52:55,385
But I'm actually writing a book.
A children's book.

895
00:52:56,155 --> 00:52:57,554
It was Arthur's idea.

896
00:52:57,723 --> 00:53:01,682
Well, make sure there are lots of pictures,
otherwise he won't understand it.

897
00:53:01,861 --> 00:53:04,762
I think Arthur understands
more than you realize.

898
00:53:11,467 --> 00:53:15,301
So, Hobson, are there any men
in your life?

899
00:53:15,671 --> 00:53:18,162
Are you attempting
to make small talk with me?

900
00:53:18,374 --> 00:53:20,934
I am attempting it. Is it working?

901
00:53:21,744 --> 00:53:24,474
- No, not really.
- Darn it.

902
00:53:25,314 --> 00:53:26,406
So?

903
00:53:27,884 --> 00:53:29,350
Any man I've ever met...

904
00:53:29,518 --> 00:53:35,423
...pales in comparison to the dazzling
floor show that is Arthur's company.

905
00:53:38,693 --> 00:53:41,423
I know you were being sarcastic
just then...

906
00:53:42,197 --> 00:53:45,394
...but it really is quite dazzling.

907
00:53:45,567 --> 00:53:48,934
All is fair in love and war, eh, darling?

908
00:53:49,103 --> 00:53:51,230
Do you think he's okay?

909
00:53:51,405 --> 00:53:52,429
Ow! Ow!

910
00:53:52,606 --> 00:53:55,598
- Bad horse.
- Ow! That's not erotic. It just hurts.

911
00:53:55,776 --> 00:53:57,710
No. Susan. Stop it.
You can't do that.

912
00:53:57,878 --> 00:54:00,574
Horses and cats can't mate.
Our children will be monsters.

913
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:10,048
Hobson, it's not what it looks like.
Unless it looks like a cat raping a horse.

914
00:54:14,027 --> 00:54:15,358
Arthur.

915
00:54:15,528 --> 00:54:16,961
- What's happening?
- Oh.

916
00:54:17,130 --> 00:54:18,529
What has happened to me?

917
00:54:18,698 --> 00:54:21,565
I think the problem is your clothes
are made of metal...

918
00:54:21,734 --> 00:54:24,362
...and my bed is made of magnets.

919
00:54:24,537 --> 00:54:27,097
- Oh, you think so?
- Right. Okay. Uh, stay calm, kitty.

920
00:54:27,273 --> 00:54:29,297
I'm not a cat anymore.
I am a businesswoman.

921
00:54:29,475 --> 00:54:31,500
I think I have a remote control.
Excuse me.

922
00:54:31,677 --> 00:54:34,669
- Uh... Ah, right. I've got the remote.
- Get me off of here!

923
00:54:34,847 --> 00:54:36,781
Okay, I'm coming.
I'm gonna... Ah, got it.

924
00:54:36,949 --> 00:54:39,543
- What are you doing?
- Okay, it's not that, obviously.

925
00:54:39,718 --> 00:54:43,176
Uh, on the bright side, at least something
in this room is attracted to you.

926
00:54:43,355 --> 00:54:44,652
For the love of God.

927
00:54:44,823 --> 00:54:45,983
Maybe this.

928
00:54:47,559 --> 00:54:50,118
- Oh, are you all right?
- Not that.

929
00:54:50,294 --> 00:54:51,921
I'm not gonna press this anymore...

930
00:54:52,096 --> 00:54:55,862
...because if I press the wrong button,
the bed could fall and kill you.

931
00:54:56,033 --> 00:54:58,297
Which none of us would want.
None of us.

932
00:54:58,803 --> 00:55:00,930
I've gotta go and get Hobson.
She knows how this works.

933
00:55:01,105 --> 00:55:05,701
Oh, you are a useless man. You can't do
anything without that miserable old woman.

934
00:55:09,779 --> 00:55:11,007
There you are.

935
00:55:11,648 --> 00:55:13,377
That was a lot of primping.

936
00:55:13,550 --> 00:55:16,110
Oh, ha, yeah, yeah.
Primping. Yeah, primping.

937
00:55:16,286 --> 00:55:18,846
Yeah, it's primpalicious, though,
isn't it? The results.

938
00:55:19,022 --> 00:55:20,512
He's a primpanzee.

939
00:55:20,690 --> 00:55:24,820
Sorry about this noise. I think it's, um...
It's the bloody neighbors.

940
00:55:24,995 --> 00:55:27,429
- Neighbors?
- Well, I think I'll retire now.

941
00:55:27,597 --> 00:55:28,893
Good night, Hobson.

942
00:55:29,064 --> 00:55:32,591
Ahem. Hobson.
Um, thank you for everything.

943
00:55:32,768 --> 00:55:33,826
I did it for her.

944
00:55:34,003 --> 00:55:35,527
I don't want that poor girl humiliated.

945
00:55:35,704 --> 00:55:40,232
- You like her, don't you? She's lovely.
- Just be a grown-up for once, Arthur.

946
00:55:40,409 --> 00:55:42,206
Okay.

947
00:55:43,345 --> 00:55:48,805
Oh, um, could you detach the half-naked
businesswoman from under my bed?

948
00:55:49,083 --> 00:55:50,778
Sorry.

949
00:55:52,287 --> 00:55:53,447
Good night, Hobson.

950
00:55:53,621 --> 00:55:55,384
Goodbye, Naomi.

951
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:00,650
Not a bad back yard.

952
00:56:00,828 --> 00:56:03,922
Yes, except whenever I sunbathe nude,
I get the strangest looks.

953
00:56:04,098 --> 00:56:05,395
Oh, you're that guy.

954
00:56:05,567 --> 00:56:08,001
- Are you a bit chilly?
- Oh, yes.

955
00:56:08,169 --> 00:56:11,035
- Would you like...?
- Thank you.

956
00:56:11,204 --> 00:56:13,035
Ahem, here.

957
00:56:13,407 --> 00:56:16,342
- Is this your father's? "Gerald Bach."
- It is.

958
00:56:16,543 --> 00:56:20,809
Well, it was. I had some of his suits
re-tailored to fit me.

959
00:56:20,981 --> 00:56:23,506
It seemed silly to throw them away.

960
00:56:24,985 --> 00:56:27,317
- Mm.
- Oh.

961
00:56:27,487 --> 00:56:29,283
"Why bother taking care of yourself?"

962
00:56:29,455 --> 00:56:32,015
Ha, ha. Yeah. Just have fun.

963
00:56:32,191 --> 00:56:34,318
- Well, you seem to have a lot of fun.
- It's my calling.

964
00:56:35,695 --> 00:56:38,323
I found a free thing to show you.
It's this way.

965
00:56:38,497 --> 00:56:40,465
- Come with me. Come on.
- Okay.

966
00:56:41,634 --> 00:56:46,469
In my mind, this is the pond
from a book I had when I was a kid...

967
00:56:46,639 --> 00:56:48,469
...called Frog and Toad Together.

968
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:51,803
I love Frog and Toad. My mom used to
read them to me all the time.

969
00:56:51,977 --> 00:56:53,103
- Really?
- Yeah.

970
00:56:53,278 --> 00:56:55,610
My mom subcontracted
that job to Hobson.

971
00:56:55,780 --> 00:57:01,218
There's a really sad one
where Toad freaks out...

972
00:57:01,386 --> 00:57:04,947
...because he sees Frog sitting alone
on a rock.

973
00:57:05,123 --> 00:57:09,456
So he swims out to him with a picnic,
but then it falls in the water.

974
00:57:09,627 --> 00:57:11,117
"Our lunch is spoiled.

975
00:57:11,295 --> 00:57:13,855
I made it for you, Frog,
so you'd be happy."

976
00:57:14,031 --> 00:57:16,022
But Frog wasn't sad.

977
00:57:16,867 --> 00:57:18,698
"When I woke up, I felt good...

978
00:57:18,869 --> 00:57:22,327
...because the sun was shining.
I felt good because I was a frog."

979
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:26,703
And I felt good
because I have you for a friend.

980
00:57:29,245 --> 00:57:32,146
If you were sitting alone,
I'd bring you a sandwich.

981
00:57:33,683 --> 00:57:35,674
I'll sit alone, then.

982
00:57:52,901 --> 00:57:56,769
"And Frog and Toad
stayed on the island all afternoon."

983
00:57:56,938 --> 00:58:00,931
They ate wet sandwiches
without iced tea.

984
00:58:01,843 --> 00:58:06,007
"They were two close friends
sitting alone together."

985
00:58:09,583 --> 00:58:11,642
I couldn't tell her, Hobson.

986
00:58:11,852 --> 00:58:13,547
She's my Toad.

987
00:58:13,721 --> 00:58:15,586
Oh, bollocks.

988
00:58:16,957 --> 00:58:20,620
Listen, Arthur, I'm sure Naomi
is a very nice girl...

989
00:58:20,795 --> 00:58:23,093
...but you can't live
without the money.

990
00:58:23,864 --> 00:58:25,331
How do you know?

991
00:58:25,499 --> 00:58:29,161
Please. You can't go half an hour
without buying another sports car.

992
00:58:30,737 --> 00:58:32,728
When I was little you used to say:

993
00:58:32,906 --> 00:58:35,636
"Arthur,
you can do anything under the sun."

994
00:58:35,809 --> 00:58:37,106
I never spoke like that.

995
00:58:37,277 --> 00:58:38,403
It was a bit like that.

996
00:58:38,578 --> 00:58:40,944
That was before
you paid Elton John $2 million...

997
00:58:41,114 --> 00:58:43,344
...to sing over the PA in a grocery store.

998
00:58:43,950 --> 00:58:45,679
Yeah, well, it was Easter.

999
00:58:46,486 --> 00:58:50,080
- I think I could live without the money.
- Oh, yes? How?

1000
00:58:51,323 --> 00:58:52,415
I'd get a job.

1001
00:58:52,591 --> 00:58:54,559
- Ha!
- What?

1002
00:58:55,761 --> 00:59:00,095
Fine. Fine. Go ahead. Get a job.

1003
00:59:01,066 --> 00:59:02,590
I am a grown man...

1004
00:59:02,768 --> 00:59:07,068
...and I shall join the mature world
of gainful employment to prove it.

1005
00:59:10,408 --> 00:59:13,377
Don't let that undermine
what I just said.

1006
00:59:25,089 --> 00:59:27,556
- Do you know how to use Excel?
- No.

1007
00:59:27,724 --> 00:59:29,749
- PowerPoint?
- No.

1008
00:59:30,794 --> 00:59:33,262
- Outlook.
- Generally positive. You know, I mean...

1009
00:59:33,430 --> 00:59:36,160
- ...I have down days like anyone, but...
- It's a program.

1010
00:59:36,333 --> 00:59:38,164
Oh, um, no.

1011
00:59:39,202 --> 00:59:40,226
Can you file?

1012
00:59:40,403 --> 00:59:41,427
- File?
- Yes.

1013
00:59:41,605 --> 00:59:43,072
In a?

1014
00:59:44,174 --> 00:59:45,198
No.

1015
00:59:46,777 --> 00:59:48,676
There must be something I can do.

1016
00:59:51,781 --> 00:59:52,805
Hey!

1017
00:59:52,982 --> 00:59:55,075
And so, this is how you simply sign on...

1018
00:59:55,251 --> 00:59:56,809
...and that unlocks the register.

1019
00:59:56,986 --> 01:00:01,787
Now, you clock in, employee number,
password and the register's yours.

1020
01:00:02,525 --> 01:00:04,686
This, uh, might seem a bit much
for my first day...

1021
01:00:04,860 --> 01:00:07,760
...but could I inquire as to the
possibility of a transfer...

1022
01:00:07,929 --> 01:00:09,760
...to the costume-greeter department?

1023
01:00:09,931 --> 01:00:10,989
I think I'd thrive.

1024
01:00:11,166 --> 01:00:13,794
No. Let's just start
with the register for you.

1025
01:00:14,002 --> 01:00:15,867
I've got my own costume, if that helps.

1026
01:00:16,037 --> 01:00:18,028
Nope, doesn't really make
a difference. No.

1027
01:00:18,206 --> 01:00:19,503
Register. So I've cleared it.

1028
01:00:19,674 --> 01:00:22,040
Go ahead and enter your
employee number and log in.

1029
01:00:23,411 --> 01:00:26,778
- Okay. You just hit a lot of random keys.
- Well, that's what you did, in fairness.

1030
01:00:28,148 --> 01:00:30,548
- It says "invalid key."
- Yes. Invalid key.

1031
01:00:30,717 --> 01:00:32,446
That means that I need to reset this.

1032
01:00:32,619 --> 01:00:35,645
This may take a moment.
Would you mind just stepping right over...?

1033
01:00:35,823 --> 01:00:39,486
How did he get that job, exactly? What
is he, the owner? The son of the owner?

1034
01:00:39,660 --> 01:00:42,857
- You can't do it, and you never will.
- Never?

1035
01:00:43,030 --> 01:00:44,054
That's harsh.

1036
01:00:44,231 --> 01:00:46,563
I've entered
your employee number and... Oh.

1037
01:00:46,733 --> 01:00:48,131
Want some?

1038
01:00:48,401 --> 01:00:51,370
- I think you should take the day off.
- As a reward?

1039
01:00:51,938 --> 01:00:53,997
Tomorrow we'll find
something more suitable for you.

1040
01:00:54,173 --> 01:00:56,664
I think what he's doing is derivative.

1041
01:01:03,983 --> 01:01:06,008
Oh, the moon really is following me.

1042
01:01:06,185 --> 01:01:09,085
Would you stop going on about the moon
following you?

1043
01:01:10,488 --> 01:01:11,580
He's lunar.

1044
01:01:11,756 --> 01:01:12,780
He's clearly a pervert.

1045
01:01:25,303 --> 01:01:28,738
Arthur? There've been some reports
of staff members eating on the floor.

1046
01:01:28,906 --> 01:01:30,168
Do you know anything about that?

1047
01:01:30,341 --> 01:01:31,831
Um, no.

1048
01:01:32,009 --> 01:01:34,239
No, I don't know anything
about that, Peter.

1049
01:01:34,411 --> 01:01:37,107
You know, I think it's not appropriate
for you to be on the floor.

1050
01:01:37,281 --> 01:01:39,841
We should find something
for you in the stock room.

1051
01:01:43,587 --> 01:01:44,611
Excuse me.

1052
01:01:45,890 --> 01:01:49,222
If I gave you $10,000...

1053
01:01:49,392 --> 01:01:52,623
...would you let me wear this costume
for one hour?

1054
01:01:54,297 --> 01:01:58,893
Hello. Welcome to the store.
May all your dreams come true.

1055
01:01:59,068 --> 01:02:00,933
Free candy! Here you go, kids!

1056
01:02:02,405 --> 01:02:04,270
I'm a lovely bear. Grr.

1057
01:02:05,642 --> 01:02:08,132
Sorry. Sorry. I'm not a genuine bear.

1058
01:02:08,310 --> 01:02:10,778
Here, listen, you take this with you.

1059
01:02:10,946 --> 01:02:15,076
If you leave very quickly, security won't
have an opportunity to ascertain you.

1060
01:02:15,250 --> 01:02:17,150
- Go. Try not to look suspicious.
- Arthur?

1061
01:02:17,319 --> 01:02:18,581
- Hello.
- What are you doing?

1062
01:02:18,754 --> 01:02:20,551
Peter, I can explain everything.

1063
01:02:22,391 --> 01:02:24,484
I've got one. I'm okay.

1064
01:02:27,595 --> 01:02:28,619
Arthur.

1065
01:02:30,131 --> 01:02:33,464
- May I have a word with you?
- Is that word "promotion"?

1066
01:02:34,869 --> 01:02:38,202
One apocalyptic hangover, no job.

1067
01:02:38,673 --> 01:02:40,573
Congratulations, Arthur.

1068
01:02:43,077 --> 01:02:45,978
The employment market is a vortex.

1069
01:02:46,147 --> 01:02:51,448
"Aquarium needs help
cleaning tanks. Swim with the fishes."

1070
01:02:51,651 --> 01:02:52,948
That is a Mob threat.

1071
01:02:53,153 --> 01:02:55,485
None of these jobs make any sense at all.

1072
01:02:55,655 --> 01:02:58,453
"Systems integration professional."

1073
01:02:58,658 --> 01:03:00,285
Would anyone do it as an amateur?

1074
01:03:00,460 --> 01:03:02,451
Would anyone approach
systems integration...

1075
01:03:02,629 --> 01:03:05,894
...as a hobby for fun on a Saturday
afternoon instead of flying a kite?

1076
01:03:06,066 --> 01:03:09,523
Who is integrating systems
for their own amusement?

1077
01:03:10,869 --> 01:03:11,927
Hobson.

1078
01:03:13,105 --> 01:03:16,541
I think in order to do this...

1079
01:03:16,709 --> 01:03:19,439
...I may have to be a little more sober.

1080
01:03:24,416 --> 01:03:25,883
What do you think?

1081
01:03:26,051 --> 01:03:28,985
To, you know, preserve my anonymity.

1082
01:03:29,954 --> 01:03:32,286
You're right,
it would be a shame to jeopardize...

1083
01:03:32,457 --> 01:03:35,051
...such a distinguished public profile.

1084
01:03:43,134 --> 01:03:46,000
I stole from my friends, my family.

1085
01:03:46,570 --> 01:03:49,334
I sold my son's tricycle
so I could score some junk.

1086
01:03:50,007 --> 01:03:51,907
- Jesus.
- I was so drunk once...

1087
01:03:52,075 --> 01:03:54,942
...I backed my car
over my mother outside Walgreens.

1088
01:03:55,112 --> 01:03:56,170
Thirty-seven days sober.

1089
01:03:57,547 --> 01:04:00,243
But sometimes, it's just so hard.

1090
01:04:00,417 --> 01:04:01,975
Like I'm in this grave...

1091
01:04:02,152 --> 01:04:06,019
Whoa, this is depressing.
It's like unhappy hour.

1092
01:04:06,188 --> 01:04:07,883
- Shh.
- It is. I don't like it in here.

1093
01:04:08,057 --> 01:04:09,581
This is making me want to drink more.

1094
01:04:09,759 --> 01:04:13,251
Sir, you need to wait till the end
of the meeting. Go on, James.

1095
01:04:13,662 --> 01:04:14,993
It's okay. I'm done.

1096
01:04:16,365 --> 01:04:17,559
And you are?

1097
01:04:19,101 --> 01:04:21,831
My name is...

1098
01:04:22,038 --> 01:04:23,767
...Gandalf.

1099
01:04:23,939 --> 01:04:25,736
Hi, Gandalf.

1100
01:04:26,174 --> 01:04:27,937
Hello.

1101
01:04:28,343 --> 01:04:33,679
And I came here because I'd like to drink
a bit less. Not give it up altogether.

1102
01:04:33,848 --> 01:04:36,476
Maybe 5, 10 percent cut down.
Reasonable.

1103
01:04:36,651 --> 01:04:41,782
Look, I'm sorry. No one's gonna convince
me that my life isn't fun, okay?

1104
01:04:41,956 --> 01:04:44,424
And forgive my crassness...

1105
01:04:44,592 --> 01:04:48,687
...but if I ran my mother over,
I'd be out celebrating with booze.

1106
01:04:49,129 --> 01:04:52,997
Which is what I plan to do right now.

1107
01:04:53,167 --> 01:04:54,600
Cheerio.

1108
01:04:54,768 --> 01:04:57,134
Excuse me. Hobson.

1109
01:04:59,073 --> 01:05:01,541
My name is Lillian and I'm an alcoholic.

1110
01:05:01,708 --> 01:05:03,005
Hi, Lillian.

1111
01:05:03,177 --> 01:05:04,644
Good afternoon.

1112
01:05:04,812 --> 01:05:07,245
I'm rich. I'm fabulously rich.

1113
01:05:07,980 --> 01:05:10,642
I'm also generous and kindhearted.

1114
01:05:11,684 --> 01:05:16,053
My father died when I was young and
my mother was absent most of the time.

1115
01:05:16,222 --> 01:05:20,022
Is this an excuse for making a mockery
of my life?

1116
01:05:20,326 --> 01:05:23,056
Oh, sure, it all looks very wild
from the outside.

1117
01:05:23,229 --> 01:05:27,255
Do you know, I once went to bed with three
European princesses at the same time.

1118
01:05:27,432 --> 01:05:29,263
But, A, I can't remember anything
about it...

1119
01:05:29,434 --> 01:05:31,368
...and, B, apparently,
I vomited on two of them...

1120
01:05:31,536 --> 01:05:33,902
...before losing control of my bladder
on the third.

1121
01:05:34,072 --> 01:05:36,597
Oh, yes, all such fun.

1122
01:05:36,775 --> 01:05:40,040
Until the fog parts,
and suddenly there's a hole so big...

1123
01:05:40,212 --> 01:05:45,513
...that all the vintage champagne and the
Batmobiles in the world won't fill it.

1124
01:05:45,683 --> 01:05:49,847
And then? Well, then,
I'm all alone on my magnetic bed...

1125
01:05:50,020 --> 01:05:53,854
...wondering what venereal disease
I've just caught.

1126
01:06:01,232 --> 01:06:03,359
Always the quiet ones.

1127
01:06:08,104 --> 01:06:10,402
This is itchy.

1128
01:06:20,483 --> 01:06:24,385
That was really lovely what you said
in there about me.

1129
01:06:25,787 --> 01:06:30,781
Now, if you could just do the drinking for
me, I think we'd have this thing cracked.

1130
01:06:47,308 --> 01:06:49,936
- Vivienne.
- Yes?

1131
01:06:51,078 --> 01:06:53,239
Don't make me do this, please.

1132
01:06:54,782 --> 01:06:56,682
I'm not the one with a choice.

1133
01:06:56,884 --> 01:06:58,909
You can walk away any time you like.

1134
01:06:59,086 --> 01:07:01,680
There's a simple solution
to all of this, Arthur.

1135
01:07:01,889 --> 01:07:04,551
Marry Susan
and cheat with the nobody from Queens.

1136
01:07:34,119 --> 01:07:36,917
Hello, Naomi's dad.
Is your daughter here?

1137
01:07:37,089 --> 01:07:39,717
Her name is Naomi.
Just clear up any confusion.

1138
01:07:39,892 --> 01:07:43,123
It's a little late, but I wasn't
sleeping myself. Come in, come in.

1139
01:07:43,295 --> 01:07:44,387
Arthur?

1140
01:07:44,963 --> 01:07:47,227
Oh, hello, Naomi.

1141
01:07:51,135 --> 01:07:53,035
You may wanna sit down.

1142
01:07:56,140 --> 01:07:57,198
Or lay down.

1143
01:07:57,375 --> 01:07:59,969
Although I prefer you stayed awake,
because this is important.

1144
01:08:00,345 --> 01:08:01,437
What is it?

1145
01:08:01,946 --> 01:08:04,244
I'm engaged to another Susan.

1146
01:08:04,449 --> 01:08:06,882
Woman. Another Susan woman.

1147
01:08:08,518 --> 01:08:09,951
You're engaged?

1148
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:13,749
I'm so sorry I didn't tell you.
I meant to before.

1149
01:08:13,957 --> 01:08:16,824
You meant to tell me that you were
engaged to another woman.

1150
01:08:16,994 --> 01:08:21,431
- I was gonna get Hobson to do it...
- Oh, my God. Arthur.

1151
01:08:21,598 --> 01:08:23,122
- Who do you think you are?
- Naomi.

1152
01:08:23,900 --> 01:08:26,197
I'm not saying I think I'm Naomi.
You are.

1153
01:08:26,369 --> 01:08:28,269
Why else would you be wearing
her pajamas.

1154
01:08:28,671 --> 01:08:32,107
I didn't mean for this to happen,
but then I started falling for you.

1155
01:08:32,275 --> 01:08:34,573
And I thought,
"Oh, no. I'm falling for Naomi...

1156
01:08:34,744 --> 01:08:37,577
...and I have to marry Susan woman
or I'll lose the money."

1157
01:08:38,180 --> 01:08:41,115
Let me get this straight.
You don't wanna marry this woman.

1158
01:08:41,284 --> 01:08:44,048
- Susan woman.
- But you're going to...

1159
01:08:44,220 --> 01:08:46,449
...because you're scared
of losing the money?

1160
01:08:46,621 --> 01:08:50,751
- Yeah, see, I'm trapped by the money.
- Oh, you're trapped by the money.

1161
01:08:50,925 --> 01:08:54,053
Oh, okay. Well, we should probably
start a telethon.

1162
01:08:54,229 --> 01:08:57,494
And then people could call in
and relieve you from this horrible money.

1163
01:08:57,666 --> 01:08:59,531
If you think it would help.

1164
01:08:59,701 --> 01:09:02,465
Naomi, Naomi, Naomi, please.

1165
01:09:02,904 --> 01:09:05,997
You're the most special person...

1166
01:09:06,173 --> 01:09:08,334
...that I have ever...
What, lied to?

1167
01:09:08,742 --> 01:09:10,300
I was gonna say "met."

1168
01:09:11,078 --> 01:09:13,706
Am I the most special person
you ever made this for?

1169
01:09:14,515 --> 01:09:17,643
Who makes a PEZ dispenser
of somebody's head...

1170
01:09:17,818 --> 01:09:19,683
...when they're engaged
to someone else?

1171
01:09:19,853 --> 01:09:22,048
Admittedly, we're a small demographic.

1172
01:09:22,222 --> 01:09:23,450
Stop joking.

1173
01:09:23,624 --> 01:09:26,683
Okay. Let me run this up the flag pole.

1174
01:09:26,859 --> 01:09:30,226
What if I were to install a secret door?

1175
01:09:30,663 --> 01:09:33,655
It leads to an apartment.
And you live in that.

1176
01:09:33,833 --> 01:09:36,461
On the other side of that door,
I'm married to Susan.

1177
01:09:36,636 --> 01:09:40,572
That's not ideal. But on the bright side,
I assure you it's entirely sexless.

1178
01:09:40,740 --> 01:09:43,538
What...? Naomi, don't leave, Naomi.

1179
01:09:43,710 --> 01:09:47,941
This is my apartment, Arthur.
You have to leave.

1180
01:09:53,418 --> 01:09:55,409
This is for you.

1181
01:09:55,687 --> 01:09:59,054
For your dad. For your writing career.

1182
01:10:03,095 --> 01:10:05,187
Nine hundred
and ninety-nine thousand dollars.

1183
01:10:05,363 --> 01:10:08,855
- I thought a million would be vulgar.
- We don't want your money.

1184
01:10:10,768 --> 01:10:12,599
Could you leave?

1185
01:10:13,838 --> 01:10:15,863
Can I just stay here for a minute, please?

1186
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:17,564
Why?

1187
01:10:18,209 --> 01:10:23,976
Because it will reduce the proportion of my
life that I spend feeling utterly miserable.

1188
01:10:24,714 --> 01:10:26,807
Goodbye, Arthur.

1189
01:10:36,726 --> 01:10:38,489
Closet.

1190
01:10:47,903 --> 01:10:50,030
And back, two, three. Front, two, three.

1191
01:10:50,205 --> 01:10:51,638
Back. And here we turn.

1192
01:10:52,241 --> 01:10:54,801
This is gonna be our first dance
as husband and wife.

1193
01:10:54,977 --> 01:10:57,343
At least you could just try to smile.

1194
01:10:57,513 --> 01:10:59,071
Sorry.

1195
01:10:59,248 --> 01:11:02,411
And I apologize for leaving you
attached to that magnetic bed.

1196
01:11:02,584 --> 01:11:04,073
Oh.

1197
01:11:04,252 --> 01:11:07,153
Someone's coming to his senses. Finally.

1198
01:11:07,321 --> 01:11:09,346
Good. Now, under the arm.

1199
01:12:41,812 --> 01:12:43,369
Hobson.

1200
01:12:43,546 --> 01:12:45,275
Hobson!

1201
01:12:45,781 --> 01:12:48,841
Hobson. I've just spotted Orphan Annie
as a man.

1202
01:12:49,485 --> 01:12:50,611
Orphan Mannie!

1203
01:12:50,786 --> 01:12:53,482
Bitterman. What are you doing
in my bathroom? We discussed this.

1204
01:12:53,656 --> 01:12:56,750
Hobson left me in charge.
She went back to bed. She had a headache.

1205
01:12:57,226 --> 01:12:58,989
- Hobson's got a headache?
- Yes, sir.

1206
01:12:59,161 --> 01:13:01,391
How did she say it? What did she say?

1207
01:13:01,564 --> 01:13:04,430
"Bitterman, I'm going to bed.
I have a headache."

1208
01:13:04,733 --> 01:13:07,702
She sort of said it like that,
all broken up and staccato?

1209
01:13:08,136 --> 01:13:09,535
Pretty much, sir.

1210
01:13:09,704 --> 01:13:11,433
Solely on their mother...

1211
01:13:11,606 --> 01:13:14,700
...for food, shelter and safety.
This mother bear has no...

1212
01:13:16,378 --> 01:13:19,609
- What's the matter? Why are you in bed?
- Arthur, put my bears back on.

1213
01:13:19,781 --> 01:13:22,272
There'll be no bears
until you tell me what's the matter.

1214
01:13:25,052 --> 01:13:28,419
I'm traveling down this white tunnel.

1215
01:13:28,589 --> 01:13:30,056
There's a garden at the end.

1216
01:13:30,658 --> 01:13:34,526
Who's that red gentleman with a pitchfork?
Why is it so hot in here?

1217
01:13:34,695 --> 01:13:36,390
Stop being childish.

1218
01:13:36,797 --> 01:13:38,628
Sorry.

1219
01:13:39,166 --> 01:13:42,101
Okay, Arthur, I've got something to tell you.
Will you sit down?

1220
01:13:48,308 --> 01:13:50,037
Listen...

1221
01:13:51,344 --> 01:13:53,710
...there are three books.

1222
01:13:54,347 --> 01:13:57,282
Take them back to the library.

1223
01:13:58,084 --> 01:14:01,383
Oh, Hobson, please don't die anymore.
It's getting very boring.

1224
01:14:02,221 --> 01:14:05,656
What about you?
You look a bit lost today.

1225
01:14:07,159 --> 01:14:08,490
Naomi won't talk to me.

1226
01:14:10,896 --> 01:14:15,265
Oh, I am sorry. It's a shame she
wouldn't come to an agreement.

1227
01:14:15,434 --> 01:14:18,494
Little tart like that would've saved you
a fortune in prostitutes.

1228
01:14:19,071 --> 01:14:23,302
How dare you talk about Naomi like that.
She's one of the finest people I know.

1229
01:14:23,474 --> 01:14:25,066
I employ you to support me.

1230
01:14:25,242 --> 01:14:28,803
I don't pay you to make snide comments
about my friends. Remember that.

1231
01:14:29,213 --> 01:14:31,340
You're just Mary Poppins with menopause.

1232
01:14:37,755 --> 01:14:41,384
Delightful to see you, Hobson.
To what do I owe the pleasure?

1233
01:14:41,559 --> 01:14:44,857
Well, it's this marriage, Vivienne.

1234
01:14:45,028 --> 01:14:48,862
I'm very excited for Arthur.
I'm worried for him too.

1235
01:14:50,133 --> 01:14:51,191
Are you, now?

1236
01:14:51,735 --> 01:14:55,569
Look, he has attempted gainful employment
and he even went to AA.

1237
01:14:55,739 --> 01:14:59,300
- It didn't last very long, but I have hopes...
- AA?

1238
01:15:00,143 --> 01:15:03,339
There's this girl.
I think she's inspiring him to...

1239
01:15:03,512 --> 01:15:08,176
- He's getting married.
- Yes, but is it right for him, Vivienne?

1240
01:15:08,817 --> 01:15:11,513
Arthur does have other issues.

1241
01:15:12,254 --> 01:15:13,949
And whose fault is that?

1242
01:15:18,127 --> 01:15:23,291
Well, I'm so sorry to have wasted
your valuable time.

1243
01:15:24,832 --> 01:15:26,732
He needs this, Lillian, he's weak.

1244
01:15:28,036 --> 01:15:30,596
He's stronger than you think.

1245
01:15:40,248 --> 01:15:42,011
Who was that?

1246
01:15:42,549 --> 01:15:43,880
Um...

1247
01:15:45,285 --> 01:15:47,378
Hobson is in my house.

1248
01:15:47,554 --> 01:15:49,317
Surprisingly, I am.

1249
01:15:49,489 --> 01:15:53,357
Well, don't be intimidated by the space.
We don't use all the rooms.

1250
01:15:57,998 --> 01:16:00,466
You got that, McKenzie? Thank you.

1251
01:16:00,634 --> 01:16:02,931
Why am I stuck here in this room?

1252
01:16:03,102 --> 01:16:05,798
I'm not the bride
I'm the bloody groom

1253
01:16:08,841 --> 01:16:10,103
Isn't he charming?

1254
01:16:11,477 --> 01:16:12,739
It's the sweetest thing.

1255
01:16:12,912 --> 01:16:15,540
Oh. Oh, McKenzie, this is stunning.

1256
01:16:15,715 --> 01:16:18,548
Ooh.

1257
01:16:18,718 --> 01:16:20,845
- No metal.
- Very nice.

1258
01:16:21,020 --> 01:16:23,317
Just don't leave me for a minute

1259
01:16:23,488 --> 01:16:25,956
Or you'll come home and find me in it

1260
01:16:27,325 --> 01:16:29,156
I just made that up.
That just came to me.

1261
01:16:29,327 --> 01:16:30,658
Here.

1262
01:16:31,296 --> 01:16:35,460
Oh. Love these. The grape shears.
Look, Arthur.

1263
01:16:35,633 --> 01:16:38,295
Grape shears, what an innovation

1264
01:16:38,470 --> 01:16:41,598
You can use them for my castration

1265
01:16:43,073 --> 01:16:47,237
Because she does that. I've been...
I've been horribly emasculated.

1266
01:16:51,181 --> 01:16:52,910
Arthur misses you desperately.

1267
01:16:53,350 --> 01:16:56,615
Has he asked you to go on a tour
of all of the girls that he misses?

1268
01:16:56,787 --> 01:16:59,984
No, he's far too decent to be involved
in anything as tawdry as this.

1269
01:17:00,157 --> 01:17:01,317
As what?

1270
01:17:01,492 --> 01:17:03,789
As my plea not to give up on him.

1271
01:17:08,197 --> 01:17:09,926
You really look after him, don't you?

1272
01:17:10,133 --> 01:17:14,001
Yes, I do.
And it's a job that I recommend highly.

1273
01:17:14,403 --> 01:17:16,428
A, um, taste of England.

1274
01:17:16,606 --> 01:17:19,575
Oh. Oh, lovely.

1275
01:17:20,076 --> 01:17:22,839
As, I believe,
you look after this gentleman.

1276
01:17:23,245 --> 01:17:27,443
Look, I appreciate what you're trying
to do, but Arthur is getting married.

1277
01:17:28,950 --> 01:17:35,014
Naomi, if there's one thing an old woman
can recognize it's a young man in love.

1278
01:17:40,262 --> 01:17:41,524
How's that tea?

1279
01:17:42,296 --> 01:17:43,456
Like sewage.

1280
01:17:50,304 --> 01:17:52,772
- I'm so sorry.
- Uh, are you okay?

1281
01:17:52,940 --> 01:17:57,468
Thank you. Thanks, ladies, for such
a lovely afternoon. These are gorgeous.

1282
01:17:57,778 --> 01:17:59,871
- Arthur, hasn't it been...?
- Cheers. Thank you.

1283
01:18:00,047 --> 01:18:02,014
Thank you, ladies. Thank you.

1284
01:18:02,182 --> 01:18:04,742
I'll be here all week.
And for the rest of my bloody life.

1285
01:18:10,990 --> 01:18:12,787
Hey. Hello.

1286
01:18:13,927 --> 01:18:14,951
What?

1287
01:18:16,262 --> 01:18:17,854
It's just a headache.

1288
01:18:18,031 --> 01:18:22,126
Hold on. You've been having tests for
months. The doctor told me on the phone.

1289
01:18:22,301 --> 01:18:24,326
Oh, bother snaps.

1290
01:18:24,503 --> 01:18:26,232
Well, what do doctors know anyway?

1291
01:18:26,405 --> 01:18:30,205
I think they're usually really well qualified, Hobson.
Why didn't you mention this?

1292
01:18:30,576 --> 01:18:34,637
I'm sorry.
It's just I didn't want to worry you.

1293
01:18:35,113 --> 01:18:36,546
Well, now I am worried.

1294
01:18:39,685 --> 01:18:43,381
But forget the worry
and enjoy this extravagant gesture!

1295
01:18:43,554 --> 01:18:46,580
Look at those bears. I love them.

1296
01:18:46,757 --> 01:18:48,884
- The biggest ones in the shop.
- Can I have one?

1297
01:18:49,060 --> 01:18:51,688
That's part of a display.
They didn't wanna sell that one.

1298
01:18:53,764 --> 01:18:55,061
Put this on, please.

1299
01:18:55,233 --> 01:18:56,495
I'm not putting that on.

1300
01:18:57,101 --> 01:18:59,501
Put it on or the bears will be incinerated.

1301
01:19:08,511 --> 01:19:09,773
Humiliating.

1302
01:19:09,946 --> 01:19:11,937
- You look really dignified.
- Mm.

1303
01:19:16,219 --> 01:19:18,619
How much did you waste on this?

1304
01:19:18,788 --> 01:19:21,018
They're very reasonable, actually.

1305
01:19:21,190 --> 01:19:24,751
- Uh, so say, "Wash your winkie."
- Wash your winkie.

1306
01:19:26,629 --> 01:19:29,223
Say, "If you have to pay them,
it's not love."

1307
01:19:29,398 --> 01:19:31,559
If you have to pay, it's not love.

1308
01:19:31,734 --> 01:19:33,725
Ha! You do one, you do one.

1309
01:19:33,903 --> 01:19:36,201
Could you do Sammy Davis, Jr?

1310
01:19:36,405 --> 01:19:38,600
Sammy Davis, Jr. Is not to do
with that costume.

1311
01:19:38,774 --> 01:19:40,833
- I like Sammy.
- What's the point in that?

1312
01:19:41,009 --> 01:19:43,500
I see you've decided not to grow up.

1313
01:19:43,678 --> 01:19:46,476
Yeah, I already decided not to bother.

1314
01:19:49,350 --> 01:19:51,477
- Where's Naomi?
- Outside. Do you wanna see her?

1315
01:19:52,887 --> 01:19:54,980
You see her for me, will you?

1316
01:20:00,928 --> 01:20:02,156
How is she?

1317
01:20:02,729 --> 01:20:05,857
All she'll tell me is she's got a headache.
No one else will tell me anything...

1318
01:20:06,033 --> 01:20:09,059
...because we're not family.
That's hospitals.

1319
01:20:10,103 --> 01:20:11,400
Why was she at your house?

1320
01:20:11,705 --> 01:20:16,108
Hobson and I hang out all the time. We go
shoplifting every Wednesday. Bergdorf's.

1321
01:20:16,310 --> 01:20:19,143
That's a good time to do it.
Hardly any security.

1322
01:20:19,579 --> 01:20:21,512
She was worried about you.

1323
01:20:26,218 --> 01:20:28,584
Hey, how's the writing going?

1324
01:20:29,588 --> 01:20:32,079
It's really good, actually.

1325
01:20:32,458 --> 01:20:34,255
I sold my book.

1326
01:20:34,427 --> 01:20:37,555
Congratulations, that's such fantastic news.
You deserve that.

1327
01:20:37,730 --> 01:20:40,198
When you found out,
did you do a scream?

1328
01:20:40,366 --> 01:20:42,026
I did. I went:

1329
01:20:46,037 --> 01:20:48,164
- Only louder.
- Right.

1330
01:20:48,340 --> 01:20:53,607
Yeah. I mean, a scream is defined
by its vocal quality to some degree.

1331
01:20:54,713 --> 01:20:57,147
I've been really angry at you.

1332
01:20:58,049 --> 01:21:03,111
And I've been rehearsing in my head what I
was gonna say to you if I saw you again.

1333
01:21:03,287 --> 01:21:05,687
And it was gonna start with, "Hi, Arthur."

1334
01:21:05,856 --> 01:21:07,483
That's conventional.

1335
01:21:07,658 --> 01:21:11,560
And then I was gonna
get into a lot of really mean stuff.

1336
01:21:12,463 --> 01:21:17,457
And it was gonna be directed at you in
a very pointed way because you lied to me.

1337
01:21:17,634 --> 01:21:21,160
But then I would run out of steam
eventually and I'd say, begrudgingly:

1338
01:21:21,938 --> 01:21:25,567
"Thank you for encouraging me
with my writing."

1339
01:21:26,743 --> 01:21:31,237
And then I would get very serious and I'd
look at you in the eyes and I would say:

1340
01:21:31,781 --> 01:21:33,476
"Arthur...

1341
01:21:33,916 --> 01:21:35,178
...you have a problem."

1342
01:21:37,086 --> 01:21:41,021
I'm glad that was hypothetical
because that would be really hard to hear.

1343
01:21:42,491 --> 01:21:43,515
How is Hobson?

1344
01:21:43,692 --> 01:21:46,183
Ah. Well...

1345
01:21:47,129 --> 01:21:49,723
Naomi, this is Susan...

1346
01:21:50,499 --> 01:21:52,626
...my fiancée.

1347
01:21:52,801 --> 01:21:55,361
And, uh, Susan, this is Naomi.

1348
01:21:55,537 --> 01:21:57,164
It's nice to finally meet you.

1349
01:21:57,339 --> 01:22:00,364
That is like a medium-size ice rink.

1350
01:22:00,541 --> 01:22:03,510
And ice rink. That's what I said,
but I said for mice. Because it's small.

1351
01:22:03,677 --> 01:22:06,339
- You're a tour guide, right?
- Yep.

1352
01:22:06,514 --> 01:22:09,415
Well, actually, Susan, Naomi's a writer.
She's being published.

1353
01:22:09,583 --> 01:22:12,211
Oh, well, congratulations.
Who's gonna publish your book?

1354
01:22:12,386 --> 01:22:14,946
- Doesn't matter, does it?
- Uh, Painted Wagon Press.

1355
01:22:15,122 --> 01:22:17,113
- They're all the same.
- Ha, ha, Painted Wagon Press.

1356
01:22:17,291 --> 01:22:19,885
That name sounds familiar.
Sorry, I can't think of...

1357
01:22:20,061 --> 01:22:22,119
Why might that name
sound so familiar to me?

1358
01:22:22,629 --> 01:22:25,120
Can you help me with that?
Why I might know that name?

1359
01:22:25,665 --> 01:22:28,429
No, Susan, I can't.

1360
01:22:29,102 --> 01:22:30,126
Oh.

1361
01:22:30,303 --> 01:22:33,033
It's coming to me.
Bach Worldwide just acquired them.

1362
01:22:33,973 --> 01:22:37,238
You should've come to me about that.
I could've made you a better deal.

1363
01:22:38,645 --> 01:22:40,612
But why would you buy them?

1364
01:22:42,214 --> 01:22:44,910
So you could tell them
to publish my book.

1365
01:22:51,256 --> 01:22:52,814
Thank you.

1366
01:22:55,260 --> 01:22:57,558
What'd you do that for?

1367
01:22:58,097 --> 01:23:00,394
I just did her a favor.

1368
01:23:01,532 --> 01:23:03,159
Naomi, wait.

1369
01:23:05,636 --> 01:23:07,263
Wait.

1370
01:23:08,973 --> 01:23:12,465
I didn't think I was ever gonna see you
again, and I think you're talented...

1371
01:23:12,643 --> 01:23:14,975
I thought other people
thought that I was talented.

1372
01:23:15,146 --> 01:23:18,582
I thought that I had earned it.
I thought that I had earned it.

1373
01:23:18,749 --> 01:23:21,740
And that felt really good.
I like that. I like earning something.

1374
01:23:21,918 --> 01:23:27,652
And I know that you don't know
what that feels like, but it's great.

1375
01:23:29,126 --> 01:23:31,822
You should try it sometime.

1376
01:23:36,199 --> 01:23:37,928
Ow, ow, ow.

1377
01:23:38,101 --> 01:23:40,967
I cut my hand. There's blood in those.

1378
01:23:42,138 --> 01:23:45,130
Actually, um, don't eat them
because of the blood.

1379
01:23:54,517 --> 01:23:56,417
Hobson, how does this bag of tea work?

1380
01:23:56,585 --> 01:24:00,111
Do you tear the top off
or you use this to cut in? How?

1381
01:24:00,288 --> 01:24:02,381
No, you put the whole bag in the pot.

1382
01:24:02,557 --> 01:24:05,253
- Just put the whole bag in?
- Mm. With water. Hot water.

1383
01:24:05,426 --> 01:24:07,155
- Brilliant.
- But not out of the tap.

1384
01:24:07,328 --> 01:24:08,386
- From a...?
- Kettle.

1385
01:24:08,563 --> 01:24:09,894
Brilliant. Perfect.

1386
01:24:15,770 --> 01:24:17,761
Be careful of that plate.
It's gonna be very, very...

1387
01:24:19,140 --> 01:24:20,731
Oh, God, no!

1388
01:24:20,908 --> 01:24:22,705
Hot.

1389
01:24:22,910 --> 01:24:25,401
I think I was better off in the hospital.

1390
01:24:27,414 --> 01:24:29,143
Bon appétit.

1391
01:24:32,553 --> 01:24:35,852
Actually, my medication
makes me sufficiently nauseous.

1392
01:24:36,023 --> 01:24:38,218
You're forever pestering me
about change...

1393
01:24:38,392 --> 01:24:41,849
...and you're afraid to eat a little bowl
of spaghetti circles. Come along.

1394
01:24:45,298 --> 01:24:47,198
Please let me look after you.

1395
01:25:00,378 --> 01:25:01,504
Quite nice.

1396
01:25:01,680 --> 01:25:03,113
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

1397
01:25:03,615 --> 01:25:06,448
- It's not unpleasant, is it?
- Well, it is unpleasant...

1398
01:25:06,618 --> 01:25:07,949
Ha.
...but it's quite nice.

1399
01:25:08,386 --> 01:25:10,479
I'm a genius in there.

1400
01:25:21,432 --> 01:25:23,900
Mother bear will care for her cubs...

1401
01:25:24,068 --> 01:25:26,730
...for up to two years.

1402
01:25:47,957 --> 01:25:49,584
Lovely.

1403
01:25:50,927 --> 01:25:53,259
Come on, come on, come on.

1404
01:25:53,429 --> 01:25:55,363
- No. Not like this.
- Aah! Ha-ha-ha.

1405
01:25:55,531 --> 01:25:57,260
You've got so much to give.

1406
01:26:15,183 --> 01:26:16,741
Have you called her, Arthur?

1407
01:26:17,185 --> 01:26:19,049
No.

1408
01:26:23,224 --> 01:26:25,749
Have you ever been in love, Hobson?

1409
01:26:27,361 --> 01:26:29,386
Yes, I was once.

1410
01:26:29,563 --> 01:26:32,794
Yes, in London. He was from Spain.

1411
01:26:33,167 --> 01:26:35,032
He asked me to go there with him.

1412
01:26:35,202 --> 01:26:36,794
You were nearly 3.

1413
01:26:37,271 --> 01:26:38,636
What happened?

1414
01:26:40,540 --> 01:26:43,304
Two days before I was due to leave...

1415
01:26:43,476 --> 01:26:45,774
I had my bags all packed.

1416
01:26:45,945 --> 01:26:47,139
Your father died.

1417
01:26:59,725 --> 01:27:01,317
You should've gone.
I would've understood.

1418
01:27:02,928 --> 01:27:05,055
It was too late.

1419
01:27:05,431 --> 01:27:07,626
I loved you.

1420
01:27:08,834 --> 01:27:10,825
Why have you never told me?

1421
01:27:11,070 --> 01:27:13,504
I didn't want you to feel bad.

1422
01:27:13,672 --> 01:27:17,267
- Why are you telling me now?
- I want you to feel bad.

1423
01:27:25,283 --> 01:27:28,343
So this is what it's like
to go to bed at 9:00.

1424
01:27:28,519 --> 01:27:30,282
Yes.

1425
01:27:30,488 --> 01:27:32,718
Isn't it wicked?

1426
01:27:41,932 --> 01:27:44,127
Hmm, Hobson.

1427
01:27:44,701 --> 01:27:46,566
I had a bad dream.

1428
01:27:46,737 --> 01:27:48,534
Hobson?

1429
01:27:50,040 --> 01:27:52,600
Hobson, stop mucking about.

1430
01:27:52,843 --> 01:27:56,210
You can't see a tunnel of light
and red pitchfork.

1431
01:27:56,380 --> 01:28:00,008
I'm not gonna take those three books
back to the library.

1432
01:28:02,885 --> 01:28:04,750
Hobson?

1433
01:28:10,292 --> 01:28:12,089
Nurse!

1434
01:28:12,261 --> 01:28:14,092
Nurse!

1435
01:29:17,323 --> 01:29:19,119
Bitterman?

1436
01:29:24,262 --> 01:29:26,355
We're gonna have a party.

1437
01:29:26,531 --> 01:29:28,795
I'm tired of being sad now.

1438
01:30:22,818 --> 01:30:24,945
Bitterman, what are you doing?

1439
01:30:25,120 --> 01:30:27,884
I'm trying to cheer you up, Mr. Bach.

1440
01:30:28,056 --> 01:30:29,148
Is it working?

1441
01:30:30,425 --> 01:30:31,483
Not yet.

1442
01:30:35,664 --> 01:30:36,756
How about now?

1443
01:30:37,499 --> 01:30:40,194
You have to do something funny.
You can't just stand there.

1444
01:30:40,368 --> 01:30:44,270
- Just say something incongruous or pithy.
- Okay.

1445
01:30:44,906 --> 01:30:47,101
Today's your wedding day, Mr. Bach.

1446
01:30:47,275 --> 01:30:49,835
Well, that's it. I'm gonna drown myself.

1447
01:30:50,311 --> 01:30:51,869
Mr. Bach?

1448
01:30:52,046 --> 01:30:53,946
Mr. Bach? Where'd you go?

1449
01:30:55,616 --> 01:30:58,584
Lovely to see you. Hello.

1450
01:30:59,719 --> 01:31:01,118
Chancellor.

1451
01:31:01,288 --> 01:31:03,984
- I am so delighted you're here.
- Oh, thank you.

1452
01:31:04,157 --> 01:31:07,320
I think you'll be very, very pleasantly
surprised. Enjoy yourself.

1453
01:31:07,494 --> 01:31:08,586
The groom is here.

1454
01:31:08,762 --> 01:31:12,789
Ah. I gather the groom has arrived.

1455
01:31:12,966 --> 01:31:14,763
Bitterman. Bitterman.

1456
01:31:15,402 --> 01:31:17,869
Please. I'm getting married today.

1457
01:31:18,037 --> 01:31:20,198
But you were in there too long.

1458
01:31:20,706 --> 01:31:23,675
- Oh, God. She's here.
- You're late. Was I not clear?

1459
01:31:23,842 --> 01:31:26,402
Don't... Don't... Don't blame Bitterman.

1460
01:31:26,579 --> 01:31:29,377
He had a hell of a struggle getting me
out of the bath.

1461
01:31:29,615 --> 01:31:30,707
Coffee. Now.

1462
01:31:30,883 --> 01:31:32,680
Good idea. I'll have one too.

1463
01:31:32,851 --> 01:31:33,943
I'm a bit drunk.

1464
01:31:34,119 --> 01:31:35,586
Okay.

1465
01:31:35,754 --> 01:31:38,051
The good news is you're here
and you're not wearing a cape.

1466
01:31:38,222 --> 01:31:40,213
Proud day for you, Viv?

1467
01:31:41,859 --> 01:31:44,487
I have guests to attend to. Stay.

1468
01:32:21,597 --> 01:32:23,064
Psst.

1469
01:32:23,432 --> 01:32:25,400
Small person.

1470
01:32:26,068 --> 01:32:27,433
Can you read?

1471
01:32:28,304 --> 01:32:30,363
For, like, four years. Can you?

1472
01:32:30,673 --> 01:32:32,607
Not at the moment, no.

1473
01:32:32,775 --> 01:32:33,799
Help. Come here.

1474
01:32:43,318 --> 01:32:45,218
I need you to read this for me.

1475
01:32:45,787 --> 01:32:47,379
Okay.

1476
01:32:51,926 --> 01:32:57,329
"My dearest Arthur.
Listen up, you pampered prick."

1477
01:32:57,498 --> 01:32:59,261
Carry on.

1478
01:32:59,433 --> 01:33:01,526
"You now know where the tea bags are."

1479
01:33:01,702 --> 01:33:04,296
To operate kettle, press red button.

1480
01:33:04,571 --> 01:33:06,095
Milk in refrigerator.

1481
01:33:06,273 --> 01:33:09,868
That's the big box with the pretty light
that comes on when you open the door.

1482
01:33:10,577 --> 01:33:14,741
It's not too late, Arthur.
You can do anything under the sun.

1483
01:33:14,915 --> 01:33:17,542
All my deepest, fondest love.

1484
01:33:17,717 --> 01:33:19,708
I'm smiling down at you.

1485
01:33:19,886 --> 01:33:22,878
Or, more likely, up at you.

1486
01:33:23,456 --> 01:33:27,017
"Forever and ever, H."

1487
01:33:32,465 --> 01:33:33,693
Are you crying?

1488
01:33:35,201 --> 01:33:38,192
That's a bride's job, to cry.

1489
01:33:38,370 --> 01:33:40,099
It's time to man up, Arthur.

1490
01:34:21,478 --> 01:34:22,536
Dearly beloved...

1491
01:34:23,413 --> 01:34:28,441
...we are gathered here today
to join Arthur and Susan in matrimony.

1492
01:34:29,419 --> 01:34:33,321
Which is commended
to be honorable among all men.

1493
01:34:33,490 --> 01:34:39,689
And therefore, is not by any to be entered
into unadvisedly or lightly...

1494
01:34:39,895 --> 01:34:43,695
...but reverently, discreetly and solemnly.

1495
01:34:43,866 --> 01:34:46,994
Seems like a lot of adverbs.
That seem like a lot of adverbs to you?

1496
01:34:47,169 --> 01:34:48,500
Shh, Arthur.

1497
01:34:48,670 --> 01:34:52,003
If any person can show just cause...

1498
01:34:52,307 --> 01:34:55,504
...why they may not
be joined together...

1499
01:34:55,677 --> 01:34:59,612
...let him speak now
or forever hold his peace.

1500
01:35:06,020 --> 01:35:07,146
I object!

1501
01:35:08,756 --> 01:35:12,590
- To this wedding.
- Arthur, you can't object. It's your wedding.

1502
01:35:12,760 --> 01:35:17,253
Is it my wedding? Because I think if it
was, I'd know who all these people were.

1503
01:35:17,430 --> 01:35:18,829
I mean, who are you?

1504
01:35:19,132 --> 01:35:21,327
- I'm your best man.
- I've never seen you befor...

1505
01:35:21,501 --> 01:35:24,959
- Actually, have I? I recognize you a bit.
- I'm your mother's receptionist.

1506
01:35:25,138 --> 01:35:27,106
Oh, yeah, right. It's nice to see you.

1507
01:35:27,274 --> 01:35:29,970
But what about you two?
Who's Abercrombie and who's Fitch?

1508
01:35:30,143 --> 01:35:32,668
And was there a bachelor party?
I wasn't invited.

1509
01:35:32,846 --> 01:35:36,508
If there was, then I don't think
I'd have enjoyed it. You look like squares.

1510
01:35:36,682 --> 01:35:38,650
And I've slept with three of them.

1511
01:35:38,951 --> 01:35:41,112
Not sure which three.
I just... Statistically...

1512
01:35:41,287 --> 01:35:43,619
Susan, this isn't real.

1513
01:35:43,789 --> 01:35:47,122
This wedding is a sham. It's a
wonderful sham wedding, but it's a sham.

1514
01:35:47,293 --> 01:35:48,885
We don't love each other.

1515
01:35:49,061 --> 01:35:51,621
Even you deserve better than this.

1516
01:35:55,568 --> 01:35:58,661
In fact, it was Abraham Lincoln
who said, "Freedom..."

1517
01:36:00,538 --> 01:36:01,562
That's my little girl.

1518
01:36:05,143 --> 01:36:08,078
- You will marry me.
- No, Susan. Abercrombie. Fitch.

1519
01:36:08,246 --> 01:36:13,582
I am the future of this company,
and all I need is your goddamn last name.

1520
01:36:15,653 --> 01:36:17,176
- Hit him in the face.
- No.

1521
01:36:17,354 --> 01:36:19,322
Stop.

1522
01:36:19,489 --> 01:36:21,423
Don't touch my son.

1523
01:36:24,228 --> 01:36:26,162
But Vivienne.

1524
01:36:26,396 --> 01:36:28,591
I think you've said enough.

1525
01:36:28,966 --> 01:36:29,990
Arthur, come here.

1526
01:36:40,543 --> 01:36:42,170
Are you certain about this?

1527
01:36:42,912 --> 01:36:44,607
Yes, I am.

1528
01:36:45,014 --> 01:36:46,538
It means giving up everything.

1529
01:36:47,817 --> 01:36:50,377
I'm happy to give up everything.

1530
01:36:50,920 --> 01:36:55,220
In fact, Vivienne, I can start
giving up everything right now.

1531
01:36:55,391 --> 01:36:58,553
This, for example.
Don't need that where I'm going.

1532
01:36:58,727 --> 01:37:01,218
Blue-collar district.
This will look sarcastic.

1533
01:37:01,396 --> 01:37:04,797
I feel like I'm bound up
like a little Japanese girl's foot.

1534
01:37:04,966 --> 01:37:08,766
I don't want that on anymore.
Shackles, chaining me to wealth.

1535
01:37:08,937 --> 01:37:10,302
Bloody thing. Ugh.

1536
01:37:11,006 --> 01:37:13,236
This shirt, itchy.

1537
01:37:13,408 --> 01:37:14,932
I don't want it anymore.

1538
01:37:15,110 --> 01:37:18,135
I can assure all of you that after this...

1539
01:37:18,312 --> 01:37:21,543
...I will be nowhere near the Bach fund.

1540
01:37:21,715 --> 01:37:24,912
So your investments are on solid footing.

1541
01:37:27,488 --> 01:37:31,049
Excuse me. Don't let that detract
from what I just said.

1542
01:37:31,225 --> 01:37:32,453
And finally...

1543
01:37:34,595 --> 01:37:38,860
Actually, um, these were
a Christmas present from Hobson. I...

1544
01:37:39,065 --> 01:37:40,623
I think I'll hang onto them.

1545
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:43,997
- I'm keeping this ring. I'm keeping this ring.
- Yes.

1546
01:37:44,170 --> 01:37:47,401
Okay, well, uh, I'm going to be poor now.

1547
01:37:54,614 --> 01:37:55,739
So how'd it go?

1548
01:37:56,214 --> 01:38:00,981
Well, um, I'm very sorry, Bitterman,
but I'm afraid you're out of a job.

1549
01:38:02,988 --> 01:38:04,012
Congratulations.

1550
01:38:05,023 --> 01:38:08,220
- Is there anywhere I could take you, sir?
- Well, that's very sweet...

1551
01:38:08,393 --> 01:38:11,055
...but I've gotta get used to fending
for myself now.

1552
01:38:11,229 --> 01:38:13,629
Could you hail me a cab, please?

1553
01:38:16,200 --> 01:38:18,134
Arthur.

1554
01:38:22,673 --> 01:38:25,005
- Once again, you've humiliated me.
- Sorry.

1555
01:38:25,176 --> 01:38:29,135
But this time, I respect you for it.

1556
01:38:29,313 --> 01:38:30,974
You're stronger than I thought.

1557
01:38:31,182 --> 01:38:33,343
And you've shown me the truth
about Susan.

1558
01:38:33,517 --> 01:38:35,211
Yeah, she's bloody evil, isn't she?

1559
01:38:35,385 --> 01:38:36,875
Oh.

1560
01:38:37,921 --> 01:38:40,151
- For the cab.
- Oh.

1561
01:38:40,323 --> 01:38:42,120
Good luck in your life, Arthur.

1562
01:38:44,661 --> 01:38:46,185
A bit awkward.

1563
01:38:47,564 --> 01:38:48,895
We've got to get to Queens.

1564
01:38:49,065 --> 01:38:50,692
Do you know Queens?

1565
01:38:50,867 --> 01:38:53,563
It's full of traffic, isn't it?

1566
01:38:56,872 --> 01:38:58,169
Do you know Naomi?

1567
01:38:58,340 --> 01:39:00,001
Mazel tov, I'm looking for Naomi.

1568
01:39:00,175 --> 01:39:01,733
Naomi!

1569
01:39:01,910 --> 01:39:03,002
What?

1570
01:39:04,380 --> 01:39:09,443
Hello. I remembered.
I remembered the bricks and the train.

1571
01:39:09,651 --> 01:39:11,016
I came in a taxi.

1572
01:39:11,587 --> 01:39:14,078
- You're wasted, Arthur.
- No!

1573
01:39:14,256 --> 01:39:17,747
Well, yes. But that was only
so I could get married.

1574
01:39:17,925 --> 01:39:22,692
- Oh, okay.
- Naomi! I didn't go through with it.

1575
01:39:22,864 --> 01:39:28,166
Instead, I did the only rational thing,
and I gave away all of my clothes.

1576
01:39:28,336 --> 01:39:32,067
Do you remember one word
of the last conversation we had, Arthur?

1577
01:39:32,240 --> 01:39:37,768
- Yeah, we were going to build a secret door.
- No. The other conversation.

1578
01:39:38,045 --> 01:39:41,344
I gave away billions of money for you.

1579
01:39:41,782 --> 01:39:44,250
You shouldn't have done that.

1580
01:39:45,886 --> 01:39:47,513
Naomi?

1581
01:39:50,590 --> 01:39:52,820
My mum's dead.

1582
01:39:53,760 --> 01:39:55,386
I know.

1583
01:39:56,262 --> 01:40:00,460
And I am so... I'm so, so sorry.

1584
01:40:00,633 --> 01:40:02,066
But...

1585
01:40:02,835 --> 01:40:05,429
...I can't be her replacement.

1586
01:40:07,073 --> 01:40:08,631
Okay.

1587
01:40:45,876 --> 01:40:47,468
I used to have in my apartment...

1588
01:40:47,644 --> 01:40:52,047
...a rather large,
incredibly decadent magnetic bed.

1589
01:40:52,249 --> 01:40:54,648
Thought "This bed is gonna
make me truly happy."

1590
01:40:54,817 --> 01:40:58,446
This is the one thing that my life
requires, is a floating magnetic bed.

1591
01:40:58,621 --> 01:41:03,183
When I get that, I'll be happy.
And my companion that evening was, um...

1592
01:41:03,359 --> 01:41:07,386
What's a euphemistic way to say it
that doesn't sound unpleasant? Um...

1593
01:41:07,563 --> 01:41:08,587
A prostitute. And...

1594
01:41:09,966 --> 01:41:12,264
We tried to prize open the door
of the fish tank...

1595
01:41:12,435 --> 01:41:14,493
...because we thought
we could make a phone call.

1596
01:41:14,669 --> 01:41:17,433
Broke the door off of the fish tank.

1597
01:41:17,606 --> 01:41:19,733
The fish came flooding out.
I nearly drowned.

1598
01:41:21,376 --> 01:41:25,506
It wasn't without its amusing moments,
but it took a spiritual toll on me...

1599
01:41:25,680 --> 01:41:30,583
...and none of these phone boxes, nor
magnetic beds could fill the hole within me.

1600
01:41:30,785 --> 01:41:34,777
I spent a lot of my life embarrassing
my family and people that care about me.

1601
01:41:34,955 --> 01:41:38,823
But I've made amends with my mother
now. As much as you can with a dragon.

1602
01:41:38,993 --> 01:41:40,858
I'm six months clean today.

1603
01:41:42,663 --> 01:41:44,654
Congratulations.

1604
01:41:44,899 --> 01:41:47,424
I think this is the most
I've ever valued a coin.

1605
01:42:08,821 --> 01:42:10,413
Next.

1606
01:42:10,590 --> 01:42:12,251
Next in line, please.

1607
01:42:15,894 --> 01:42:17,885
That's 12.50.

1608
01:42:30,042 --> 01:42:33,307
Lady Liberty wrapped
her giant green arms...

1609
01:42:33,478 --> 01:42:35,775
...around the Chrysler Building
one last time.

1610
01:42:35,947 --> 01:42:39,542
And then she carefully walked
back to her own island.

1611
01:42:39,717 --> 01:42:41,844
Even though they'll
always live apart...

1612
01:42:42,019 --> 01:42:45,921
...they'll still stand a little taller
and shine a little brighter...

1613
01:42:46,457 --> 01:42:48,721
...because they shared an adventure.

1614
01:42:49,227 --> 01:42:50,251
The end.

1615
01:42:53,030 --> 01:42:55,862
It's question time.
Does anybody have any questions?

1616
01:42:56,032 --> 01:42:57,090
I have a question.

1617
01:42:59,069 --> 01:43:03,802
Does anybody mind
if I tell another story?

1618
01:43:03,974 --> 01:43:05,134
- I mind.
- Me too.

1619
01:43:05,575 --> 01:43:07,475
You sound like Harry Potter.

1620
01:43:07,644 --> 01:43:10,442
Yeah, well, is that a bad thing?
He's a great wizard.

1621
01:43:10,614 --> 01:43:14,276
Listen, it's quite a good story,
and if no one here minds...

1622
01:43:14,450 --> 01:43:15,474
Uh, excuse me, sorry.

1623
01:43:15,651 --> 01:43:19,712
I'd really like the opportunity
to tell it.

1624
01:43:19,888 --> 01:43:22,356
If that's okay, um...

1625
01:43:22,891 --> 01:43:27,419
Once upon a time, there was a prince.
Handsome, he was.

1626
01:43:27,763 --> 01:43:30,095
He fell in love with a princess
from Queens.

1627
01:43:30,266 --> 01:43:32,496
- Are you a girl or a boy?
- Doesn't matter.

1628
01:43:33,102 --> 01:43:36,298
The fact is,
he loved this princess so much...

1629
01:43:36,471 --> 01:43:39,235
...that he was prepared
to give up his kingdom for her...

1630
01:43:39,407 --> 01:43:41,500
...but she turned him away.

1631
01:43:41,709 --> 01:43:44,576
- What a bitch.
- She was not. Why would you say that?

1632
01:43:44,746 --> 01:43:46,611
She did the right thing,
it turns out...

1633
01:43:46,781 --> 01:43:52,014
...because this prince
had a little bit of a problem with...

1634
01:43:52,987 --> 01:43:56,649
...candy. He couldn't get enough candy.

1635
01:43:56,823 --> 01:43:59,155
- Do you mean drugs?
- No. No. Where did you grow up?

1636
01:43:59,326 --> 01:44:00,486
- Meth?
- No.

1637
01:44:00,661 --> 01:44:02,424
- Crack?
- No. It was just booze.

1638
01:44:02,596 --> 01:44:05,463
Look, this isn't working. Okay.

1639
01:44:09,036 --> 01:44:14,496
What I came here to say to you,
Naomi, is that I'm sorry.

1640
01:44:14,974 --> 01:44:17,135
I'm sorry that I lied to you.

1641
01:44:17,310 --> 01:44:19,710
I'm sorry that I hurt you.

1642
01:44:19,879 --> 01:44:22,677
And I'm sorry
that I asked you to take care of me...

1643
01:44:22,848 --> 01:44:27,979
...when what I want more than anything
in the world is to take care of you.

1644
01:44:32,825 --> 01:44:35,793
And I think that's the end of the story.

1645
01:44:52,110 --> 01:44:54,134
Ew!

1646
01:44:55,579 --> 01:44:56,876
Hey, what's wrong with you?

1647
01:44:57,047 --> 01:45:01,074
This is just two adults
kissing in a room full of children.

1648
01:45:04,855 --> 01:45:06,584
So how's the real world treating you?

1649
01:45:06,757 --> 01:45:09,920
Oh, I've learned mostly that I should
just try and live simply now.

1650
01:45:10,094 --> 01:45:12,028
- It's better for me.
- What is this?

1651
01:45:12,196 --> 01:45:13,719
Bitterman! Why?

1652
01:45:13,896 --> 01:45:18,196
You said, "This is the girl I can buy
back with a fleet of movie cars."

1653
01:45:18,368 --> 01:45:22,964
I said this is a girl I can't buy back
with a fleet of movie cars.

1654
01:45:23,139 --> 01:45:25,403
- Oh.
- Specifically, I said "can't."

1655
01:45:25,575 --> 01:45:28,942
Get rid of...
Just get rid of them. It's embarrassing.

1656
01:45:29,112 --> 01:45:31,910
- So I guess your mother forgave you.
- Yeah, yeah, you know.

1657
01:45:32,081 --> 01:45:36,710
I got my inheritance in return
for running the Bach charity discreetly.

1658
01:45:36,885 --> 01:45:38,785
Should we just take the subway?

1659
01:45:40,255 --> 01:45:42,280
Which one's the fastest?

1660
01:45:48,830 --> 01:45:51,594
Through the park, please, Bitterman.

1661
01:49:53,495 --> 01:49:55,486
Carrot was here
