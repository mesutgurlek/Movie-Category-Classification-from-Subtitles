1
00:01:38,474 --> 00:01:41,684
So... I'm pretty good at archery.

2
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:46,439
That'll be useful
if you ever have a time machine

3
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:50,693
and your time machine breaks,
and you're stuck in the Medieval Ages.

4
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:53,613
You're funny. It's weird.

5
00:01:53,781 --> 00:01:56,449
Yeah. I'm weird.

6
00:01:56,617 --> 00:01:58,576
Me too.

7
00:01:58,744 --> 00:02:02,872
Yeah, right. Everyone loves you and
your dad's like famous, or something.

8
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:08,085
My parents are getting a divorce,
that's why I had to go to camp, so...

9
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:15,343
- Are you crying?
- No.

10
00:02:17,513 --> 00:02:19,096
Jesus.

11
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:29,816
Look... I'm not really
an affectionate person.

12
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:37,740
People aren't meant
to be together forever.

13
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:40,618
You think so?

14
00:02:40,786 --> 00:02:42,411
Yeah.

15
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:48,084
Can I finger you?

16
00:02:48,252 --> 00:02:49,418
No.

17
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:50,753
OK.

18
00:03:19,283 --> 00:03:21,742
- Come on, baby, I got ya!
- Don't drop me!

19
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:34,589
Hey! Hey!

20
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:36,299
Patrice!

21
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:41,178
Oh, my God! I told you
that this was a pajama party.

22
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:43,681
What are you wearing?
What is this?

23
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:47,310
You're wearing actual long johns?
What?!

24
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:49,395
This is a frat party.

25
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:52,148
You just have to be drunk
and look hot.

26
00:03:52,316 --> 00:03:54,233
Watch and learn.

27
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:58,487
Hey. Hey!

28
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:01,240
I'm so drunk!

29
00:04:06,622 --> 00:04:09,540
Drink! Drink! Drink!

30
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:14,670
Hey, do you know that girl?

31
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:16,172
The sexy pioneer?

32
00:04:21,053 --> 00:04:22,720
I think I know her.

33
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:28,351
I'd have sex with a pioneer.
For sure.

34
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:30,478
A hungry pioneer lost on the trail.

35
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:35,858
- Do I know you?
- Hi, Adam Franklin of Camp Weehawken.

36
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:38,319
I'm Emma Kurtzman.
You tried to finger me?

37
00:04:40,656 --> 00:04:44,367
Yeah. Wow!
Do you go here? Why?

38
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:47,203
- What are you doing at a party of frat?
- No. I go to MIT,

39
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:50,539
but I have this family thing,
and I grew up in Ann Arbor.

40
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:53,834
MIT? Wow. So you grew up to be
a lot smarter than me.

41
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:56,837
Yeah, sometimes
my neck gets sore.

42
00:04:57,005 --> 00:05:00,466
- Why?
- 'Cause my brain's so big.

43
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:08,265
I agree, it didn't work. Drop it.

44
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,686
I like you.

45
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:14,605
What? Why?
You don't even know me.

46
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,274
I like you.

47
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:23,656
I have to go to this stupid thing
tomorrow. You wanna come with me?

48
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:29,328
Yeah, sure. I'll come with you.

49
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:31,789
- What is it?
- Some stupid thing.

50
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,378
I wanted to leave you
with something David said to me

51
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:39,422
almost every day at the lab.

52
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:41,424
It's Einstein.

53
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:44,010
"There are only two ways
to live your life.

54
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:47,054
One, as if nothing is a miracle.

55
00:05:47,222 --> 00:05:50,725
The other,
as if everything is a miracle."

56
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:55,438
For David, there was no bigger miracle
than his family.

57
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:59,567
His daughters, Emma and Katie,
and his wife, Sandra.

58
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:07,992
Mom?

59
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,161
I want you to meet Adam.

60
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:14,373
I'm so sorry.

61
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:17,293
And this is my sister, Katie,
and her lover, Kevin.

62
00:06:17,461 --> 00:06:20,755
Boyfriend.
And my best friend.

63
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:26,093
Oh, well... thank you. I didn't know
you were dating someone, Emma.

64
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:27,303
Oh, I'm not.

65
00:06:27,471 --> 00:06:30,097
I just had a one-night stand with him
when I was 14.

66
00:06:32,184 --> 00:06:34,560
It was a really nice funeral.

67
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:01,629
I'm sorry.

68
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:11,972
I'm glad you stayed.

69
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:15,476
Me too.

70
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:20,564
So, I'll call you, or something...

71
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:22,358
Adam, you're wonderful.

72
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:26,028
If you're lucky,
you're never gonna see me again.

73
00:07:53,849 --> 00:07:55,141
Yes.

74
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:01,564
Hey.

75
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:06,110
Did we? Yes, we did.
We went to college together.

76
00:08:06,278 --> 00:08:07,862
You have two gay dads.

77
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:09,989
Yeah, I'm the man
with the two gay dads.

78
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:12,825
They helped me move
my boxes sophomore year.

79
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:15,786
They're the best. I love them.
I'm super straight, though.

80
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:18,122
- So, yeah.
- OK.

81
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:19,415
- You're Patrice, right?
- Yes.

82
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:21,333
Yeah, Eli. I'm with... Adam!

83
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:24,795
I'll be right back.

84
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,757
Pick up some of that kettle corn.

85
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:30,342
- It's Patrice.
- Hey!

86
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,554
- Patrice! Hey!
- How are you?

87
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:35,097
- Weird.
- Wow.

88
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:37,933
I haven't seen you in... wow.

89
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:39,476
- How are you?
- Good.

90
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:40,644
Adam.

91
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:44,481
Emma.

92
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:46,150
What is this, the Peach Pit?

93
00:08:46,318 --> 00:08:50,362
- And, yeah, that was a 90210 reference.
- Yeah, you're super straight.

94
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:54,116
- What are you doing here?
- I just moved here a week ago.

95
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:57,203
I'm doing my residency
at the Westwood Teaching Hospital.

96
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,705
- Hi.
- Vanessa, this is Emma.

97
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:04,460
- Emma, Vanessa.
- Hi. How do you do?

98
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:06,545
This is our friend, Patrice.

99
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:09,340
- Hi. How do you do?
- How do I what?

100
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:11,133
- Hi.
- Hi.

101
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:13,135
Hi, you look nice.

102
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:15,095
It's nice to meet you.

103
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:18,933
You remember my sister, Katie.
She's just finishing school here.

104
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:22,061
Yeah. I haven't seen you guys since...

105
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:24,188
- Yeah, Dad's funeral.
- Dad's funeral.

106
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:26,815
Sad.

107
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:30,819
OK. Well, we should head out, so...

108
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:32,821
Yeah, we should, too.
You know...

109
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:35,407
But we should hang out.
Let me just... I'll get your number.

110
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:38,160
Yeah, just give me your phone.
I'll put it in there.

111
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:40,704
Yeah, that's probably easier.

112
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:48,337
We really have to be
somewhere now, so...

113
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:50,464
Yeah. We should...

114
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:53,050
Totally. Totally.

115
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:54,927
All right, well, good to hang out.

116
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:56,762
- Good seeing you guys. Have fun.
- Yeah.

117
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,890
- Take care.
- Take care, ladies.

118
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:53,610
And cut!

119
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:55,279
- Great.
- That's good.

120
00:10:55,447 --> 00:10:57,323
- OK! Yeah!
- Great. Great.

121
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:01,452
OK, guys, we're gonna do this again.
All right? Five minutes.

122
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:03,287
- All right, let's...
- Good job.

123
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:06,332
- Great job. Great job...
- Wait. What are, people?

124
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:10,753
- Hey, Benji! Good scene.
- Cool. Thanks.

125
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,088
You looked great!

126
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:16,717
Sari. I told you to play hard to get.

127
00:11:16,885 --> 00:11:19,136
I'm incredibly easy to get!

128
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:21,930
Adam.

129
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:24,433
You were gonna ask me
something before the break.

130
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:25,934
- What was it?
- Yeah, I...

131
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:28,395
Wait, wait, wait. Fuck, fuckety-fuck.
What was it? Stop.

132
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:31,023
You wanted to know if you could
get off early to see your dad,

133
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:33,192
- which is, yeah, totally fine.
- Thank you.

134
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,278
By the way, tell your dad,
it's like my favorite show ever.

135
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:39,073
Love it, own it, lost it,
bought it again. It's so great.

136
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,699
"Great Scott!"

137
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,828
- You probably hear that all the time.
- Not that much.

138
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:46,455
Yeah.

139
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:49,083
Chuck!

140
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,627
Chuck! If I catch you taking pictures
of your dick one more time,

141
00:11:51,795 --> 00:11:53,545
I'm gonna take that thing away.

142
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,851
Hello. How can I help you?

143
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:11,855
- Hey, Philippe, it's Adam.
- Hi. Come in.

144
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:33,168
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey.

145
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:34,837
Check it out.

146
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:37,339
Vinyasa yoga
and the Army Ranger workout.

147
00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:41,009
- I combined them!
- Wow. That's very impressive.

148
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:43,637
I'm gonna do a video, I think.
Vinyasa Power.

149
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:45,806
I can almost see
where your muscles go.

150
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:49,935
Very funny. Hit me.

151
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:52,187
No, I'm not gonna hit you.
I don't want to hurt you.

152
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:53,772
You're not gonna hurt me.

153
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,150
Come on, hit me.
Give me your best shot.

154
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,527
Come on, quick,
before I get a hernia!

155
00:12:58,695 --> 00:12:59,736
No.

156
00:13:02,824 --> 00:13:06,160
You're right.
Let's smoke some weed.

157
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:08,162
This is really good stuff.

158
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:10,831
My agent got me one of those
medical marijuana cards.

159
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:12,666
It's nice to see they're
supporting your career.

160
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:16,044
Yeah. So, how's the show going?

161
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:17,671
I mean, great.

162
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,591
I mean, it's about high-schoolers
who sing and dance and blog.

163
00:13:21,885 --> 00:13:24,303
At least you're writing,
that's what's important.

164
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:27,014
No. I'm an assistant.

165
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:31,602
Well, but... at least they've
seen your writing.

166
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:34,229
Not yet.

167
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:35,814
Actually...

168
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:41,069
I wanted to get your opinion
on this episode that I wrote.

169
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:43,238
Kind of a sample.

170
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:47,743
That's my boy.

171
00:13:47,911 --> 00:13:50,704
I'll take a look at it, sure.
And then I'll call somebody.

172
00:13:50,914 --> 00:13:55,709
No. Do not call anyone.
Just read it and tell me what you think.

173
00:13:55,877 --> 00:13:57,169
OK.

174
00:13:58,922 --> 00:14:00,923
So...

175
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,424
Are you having sex?

176
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,011
Yes. I'm having sex.

177
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:09,014
'Cause if you want any pointers,
you know...

178
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:11,433
...I can help you out.
If there's one thing you learn

179
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:14,561
after two failed marriages,
it's how to eat kitty.

180
00:14:14,729 --> 00:14:18,106
- Anyone special?
- No.

181
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:20,359
I mean, not since Vanessa.

182
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:23,278
It's been a year.
It's time to move on.

183
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:25,280
It's been eight months, Dad.

184
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:28,575
What did you want
to talk to me about, anyway?

185
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:33,956
- You got a dog? Seriously, that's...
- Freckles! Come!

186
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:40,629
You didn't tell him yet?

187
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:42,297
Damn!

188
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:45,926
I...

189
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:50,973
Adam, I wanted to tell you.
I was just about to tell you.

190
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,307
How long?

191
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:54,726
- Well...
- How long?

192
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,853
Not long. I...

193
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:01,400
She needed a place to stay because,
you know, her landlord is such a D-bag.

194
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:04,528
Christmas.
I ran into her at a party.

195
00:15:04,696 --> 00:15:07,155
We got to talking. About you, mostly.

196
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:13,829
It looked so soft!

197
00:15:14,497 --> 00:15:16,915
It's not. God!

198
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:20,669
Oh, that really hurt. Damn.

199
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:24,506
You're fucking my ex-girlfriend?

200
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:27,634
Well, yeah, but...

201
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:34,933
- She's just so hot.
- I know how hot she is.

202
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:38,145
- That's really sweet. Thanks, guys.
- Fuck you!

203
00:15:38,313 --> 00:15:41,481
Adam. All right,
I'm not the perfect dad.

204
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:44,776
But the worst thing you can do in life
is to say no to love.

205
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:48,822
And I think she really loves me.

206
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:50,073
Don't.

207
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:51,450
Adam.

208
00:15:54,037 --> 00:15:55,871
Hey, you know the best part
about my gay dads?

209
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:56,997
What?

210
00:15:57,165 --> 00:15:59,166
They're never gonna eat out
my ex-girlfriends.

211
00:15:59,334 --> 00:16:00,959
That's true.

212
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:04,713
Hey, I heard. You and your dad
are tunnel buddies, huh?

213
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:08,717
- Wow, Wallace!
- She chose your dad over you, man.

214
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:11,637
That's like trading an iPod
for a 8 track.

215
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:15,849
You need to get even. Go have sex
with one of his ex-girlfriends.

216
00:16:16,017 --> 00:16:18,101
Hey, you think
when he's busting a nut,

217
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:22,689
he's like, "Great Scott"? No?

218
00:16:22,857 --> 00:16:26,485
Wait. Can we talk about something else?
Like, literally, anything else?

219
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:28,570
- Yeah.
- Of course. Yeah.

220
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:32,199
- Great Scott.
- OK.

221
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:36,912
- That's it. I'm going for it.
- Going for what?

222
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,872
I'm gonna call every girl in my phone

223
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,582
until someone agrees
to have sex with me.

224
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:43,293
- That's strong. Toast to that.
- Toast.

225
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:45,379
That is a terrible,
self-destructive plan,

226
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:47,422
and we're behind you
a hundred percent.

227
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:52,928
Well, hello to you!

228
00:16:56,391 --> 00:16:58,392
Yeah, I can come to Ohio.

229
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:01,812
Ohio? No, you can't.

230
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,439
I'll take a cab.

231
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:07,109
No, it's fine. I'll come to you.

232
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:08,777
What hospital?

233
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:12,614
I just really need to be
with someone right now.

234
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:14,866
Hey, I was wondering...

235
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:17,119
Do you have someplace
I could put my boner?

236
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:22,165
No, it's just... we could just snuggle
or something.

237
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:25,001
What? Well, how old are you?

238
00:17:26,337 --> 00:17:27,671
- Oh...
- OK.

239
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:31,717
I got it! I got it.

240
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:34,678
I got it. I got it.

241
00:17:34,846 --> 00:17:36,346
I got it!

242
00:18:05,877 --> 00:18:08,003
You don't remember my name, do you?

243
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,302
It's OK.

244
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:19,639
It's Shira, and you look like
you could use some coffee.

245
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:24,352
Yes. Coffee's good.

246
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,527
I got...

247
00:18:33,196 --> 00:18:34,863
Where are my pants?

248
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:38,533
I don't know. They could be anywhere.
Here's your coffee.

249
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:40,368
Thank you.

250
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:50,504
Did you have a good time last night?

251
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:54,883
It was all right.
Nothing special.

252
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:03,058
Listen, I want you to know that...

253
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:06,311
...I respect you.

254
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:08,355
Thank you.

255
00:19:08,523 --> 00:19:12,692
Normally, I would remember
the name of someone that I've...

256
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,945
What? Oh, my God.

257
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:18,406
Did you think we had sex?
Oh, my God, we did not have sex.

258
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:21,576
Hey, Adam.
You left your socks in my room.

259
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,455
- Did I?
- You did.

260
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:29,251
Did I, by chance, leave
my pants in your room?

261
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:32,128
No. When we met,
you weren't wearing pants.

262
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:35,507
Stop teasing him, you guys.

263
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:38,093
- Patrice. Hey, I know you.
- Hey.

264
00:19:38,261 --> 00:19:40,262
- Yeah.
- OK.

265
00:19:41,472 --> 00:19:42,764
What happened last night?

266
00:19:43,933 --> 00:19:46,184
- Did we do it?
- We had sex.

267
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:48,645
Yeah. I really liked it.

268
00:19:49,981 --> 00:19:55,735
I didn't know that my body
could handle that much pain.

269
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:58,405
And that I would like it.

270
00:19:59,073 --> 00:20:00,323
You're up.

271
00:20:01,284 --> 00:20:03,076
Emma.

272
00:20:03,244 --> 00:20:04,953
- You live here?
- Yep.

273
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:07,455
You feeling any better?

274
00:20:09,292 --> 00:20:12,252
Did I have sex with anyone
in this apartment last night?

275
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,379
No, you didn't.

276
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:16,798
- No. Sorry.
- You didn't.

277
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:20,343
Thank you.
Yeah, that's... that's funny.

278
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:23,555
Let's make fun
of the hung-over naked guy.

279
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:27,601
But I do have your pants,
so if you want them, come with me.

280
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:30,979
Yes. Thank you.

281
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:35,525
You don't have to feel embarrassed,
because we're all doctors,

282
00:20:35,693 --> 00:20:39,863
so we see literally
hundreds of penises a week.

283
00:20:40,031 --> 00:20:41,114
I see thousands.

284
00:20:41,282 --> 00:20:43,617
I just pulled a penis out
of a VitaminWater yesterday.

285
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:45,827
- So, we are cool with penises here.
- OK.

286
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:47,329
We're professionals.

287
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:48,622
Well...

288
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,083
It has been a pleasure.

289
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:57,505
Bravo.

290
00:20:57,673 --> 00:21:00,634
- Nice.
- Bravo, bravo.

291
00:21:02,345 --> 00:21:04,304
Yep, I'm definitely gay.

292
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:06,848
So, how did I get here?

293
00:21:07,016 --> 00:21:09,392
You texted me
that it was an emergency,

294
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:12,687
and then I texted you my address,
and then you came over.

295
00:21:12,855 --> 00:21:16,358
And I think you thought
you were at home,

296
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:18,568
because you started
taking off all your clothes.

297
00:21:18,736 --> 00:21:19,694
Oh, God.

298
00:21:19,862 --> 00:21:22,113
- Here are your pants.
- Thank you.

299
00:21:30,164 --> 00:21:31,957
So...

300
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:36,252
- Did I just pass out on your couch?
- No.

301
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:39,214
No, then you did this thing.
It was...

302
00:21:39,966 --> 00:21:42,384
...like a dance?

303
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:44,886
- Dance?
- Yeah, like...

304
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:50,558
- I shook my dick at you?
- Yeah.

305
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:53,144
Oh, shit. I'm sorry.

306
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,563
No, no, it was... it was exciting.

307
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:57,857
It was like you were cheering
while you were doing it.

308
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:01,403
You were like, "Look at my dick!"

309
00:22:03,906 --> 00:22:06,449
- Did you look at it?
- Yeah, I looked.

310
00:22:06,617 --> 00:22:10,286
It was nice.
You have a really nice penis.

311
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:13,665
- Nice?
- It seems kind of like carefree.

312
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:15,208
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

313
00:22:15,376 --> 00:22:19,129
Jesus. I don't know where to start.
My dad's...

314
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:23,216
My dad's dating my ex-girlfriend.

315
00:22:23,384 --> 00:22:25,343
You told me about it last night.

316
00:22:25,511 --> 00:22:27,095
Did I tell you like in a charming way?

317
00:22:27,263 --> 00:22:29,681
Was I like charming and funny
when I told you?

318
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:31,891
Yeah. You were...

319
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:34,185
...naked and crying.

320
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,481
Yeah.

321
00:22:38,649 --> 00:22:40,275
I'm a mess.

322
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:46,114
Hey.

323
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:49,826
It's gonna be OK.

324
00:22:53,706 --> 00:22:55,040
Thanks.

325
00:22:58,294 --> 00:22:59,711
Seriously.

326
00:23:01,255 --> 00:23:02,756
Thank you.

327
00:23:03,758 --> 00:23:08,136
I should probably get ready now.
I don't want to be late.

328
00:23:08,304 --> 00:23:12,265
Yeah, it's...
You don't want to be late.

329
00:23:12,433 --> 00:23:14,809
No, that would be bad.

330
00:23:40,461 --> 00:23:41,544
Condom?

331
00:23:41,712 --> 00:23:43,463
- Condom. Get a condom.
- I know. Condoms.

332
00:23:43,631 --> 00:23:45,507
- OK.
- Condoms.

333
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:52,138
Got it.

334
00:23:52,306 --> 00:23:53,640
- Got it.
- Hurry.

335
00:23:58,437 --> 00:23:59,604
You need help?

336
00:24:00,481 --> 00:24:02,649
- I got it.
- OK.

337
00:24:02,817 --> 00:24:04,442
Here we go.

338
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:05,902
Oh, you got your...

339
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:07,779
- Yep.
- Let me just...

340
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:29,175
- Hey.
- Yeah.

341
00:24:29,343 --> 00:24:31,261
- We're having sex.
- I know.

342
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:41,354
Emma, we have to be
in the hospital in ten minutes.

343
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:43,731
OK.

344
00:24:47,236 --> 00:24:51,156
You have 45 seconds to pull
your shit together, OK?

345
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:53,658
- I'm way ahead of you.
- Fine.

346
00:24:53,826 --> 00:24:55,660
Fine.

347
00:25:29,153 --> 00:25:32,322
- Found it!
- Oh, great.

348
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:33,781
Thank you.

349
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:38,661
So, we're not gonna
tell anyone about this, OK?

350
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:41,581
- Yeah. Of course.
- It's just easier that way.

351
00:25:41,749 --> 00:25:44,459
- Definitely.
- Good.

352
00:25:48,464 --> 00:25:50,506
Emma, time to go!

353
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,384
Coming!

354
00:25:54,011 --> 00:25:55,470
- All right?
- Is this?

355
00:25:55,638 --> 00:25:58,056
- No.
- It looks like something happened.

356
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:04,354
I'm gonna get the bill.
I'll pay for it.

357
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:05,480
Thank you.

358
00:26:05,648 --> 00:26:07,899
- Hey.
- Hey.

359
00:26:13,948 --> 00:26:15,323
Hi.

360
00:26:18,244 --> 00:26:22,330
I just wanted to follow up
that text with a phone call.

361
00:26:22,498 --> 00:26:24,874
Wanted to see
if you wanted to hang out again.

362
00:26:25,042 --> 00:26:26,334
I'm starving.

363
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:29,295
That's weird. You just pulled up

364
00:26:29,463 --> 00:26:31,798
in front of the restaurant
that I'm eating at.

365
00:26:33,175 --> 00:26:34,550
Hey.

366
00:26:36,053 --> 00:26:37,428
Hi.

367
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:41,266
- Hey. I'm Sam.
- We work together at the hospital.

368
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:43,309
We have like 15 minutes
to get food, so...

369
00:26:43,477 --> 00:26:45,520
She's just using me for my car.

370
00:26:45,688 --> 00:26:48,356
- You're a doctor?
- Not yet. Fingers crossed.

371
00:26:48,524 --> 00:26:52,026
Awesome.
That's awesome for you.

372
00:26:52,695 --> 00:26:54,195
- Hey, Eli.
- Hey.

373
00:26:54,363 --> 00:26:56,572
Well, we're kind of in a rush,
so it was good seeing you.

374
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,283
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice meeting you.

375
00:26:59,201 --> 00:27:01,077
You look beautiful today.

376
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:06,332
Nice meeting you.

377
00:27:11,505 --> 00:27:13,339
You piece of shit.

378
00:27:13,507 --> 00:27:17,593
- What?
- "What?" Let me ask you.

379
00:27:18,846 --> 00:27:20,305
Did you have sex with Emma?

380
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:23,099
No.

381
00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:26,811
Did you have sex with Emma?

382
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:29,230
Yes.

383
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:33,735
- I'm not supposed to tell anyone.
- Yes! Wow!

384
00:27:36,155 --> 00:27:38,823
I called her, but she didn't
call me back. She sent me a text.

385
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:41,617
- All right. Well, what'd she text you?
- "Hi."

386
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:44,120
- Just "Hi"?
- "Hi."

387
00:27:44,288 --> 00:27:45,788
With nothing else? Just "H-i"?

388
00:27:45,956 --> 00:27:47,707
I don't know. What do I do with that?
I don't know.

389
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:49,250
That's not good.

390
00:27:49,418 --> 00:27:51,294
You just gotta walk away, pal.
It's over.

391
00:27:51,462 --> 00:27:53,755
- She's not into it.
- Shit. Seriously?

392
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:56,299
- Good seeing you guys.
- See you later.

393
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:05,558
You really think
she's just using him for his car?

394
00:28:05,726 --> 00:28:08,978
No, Adam, I don't. I think
he wants to fuck her in his Prius.

395
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:10,855
And the thing
about fucking in a Prius

396
00:28:11,023 --> 00:28:13,024
is that you don't have
to feel guilty afterwards.

397
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:16,986
- 'Cause of the carbon footprint.
- Yeah.

398
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:24,369
- Metzner talked to me the other day.
- Shut up. What did he say?

399
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:28,039
He was like, "No, you're doing
that wrong." It was amazing.

400
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:31,125
Emma.

401
00:28:33,796 --> 00:28:35,588
What are you doing here?

402
00:28:35,756 --> 00:28:39,967
Hi. You didn't call me back,
so I thought I'd come here.

403
00:28:40,636 --> 00:28:42,136
It's for you.

404
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:46,766
"Congrats"? For what?
Having sex with you?

405
00:28:46,934 --> 00:28:52,271
Yeah. You did a good job, so...
I thought you deserved a balloon.

406
00:28:53,023 --> 00:28:54,941
- I'm working.
- OK.

407
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:58,903
So, what's up with not calling me back?

408
00:28:59,655 --> 00:29:02,073
- I'm not good at this stuff.
- At what, talking?

409
00:29:02,241 --> 00:29:05,118
Yeah, talking. Communicating.
Relationship stuff.

410
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:07,954
It's just... This is...

411
00:29:08,122 --> 00:29:09,539
If we were in a relationship,

412
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:12,750
I'd become a weird,
scary version of myself, and...

413
00:29:13,419 --> 00:29:16,045
My throat starts constricting,
the walls start throbbing.

414
00:29:16,213 --> 00:29:19,549
It's like a peanut allergy,
like... an emotional peanut allergy.

415
00:29:20,092 --> 00:29:23,302
Well, I can't date you, either.
'Cause you're not my dad's type, so...

416
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:25,471
Emma, rounds. Hey, Adam.

417
00:29:25,639 --> 00:29:28,516
- What's up?
- Look, I should probably go.

418
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:32,562
Thank you.
We'll be friends, right?

419
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:34,397
Yeah, friends.

420
00:29:35,232 --> 00:29:37,358
With the height difference?

421
00:29:37,526 --> 00:29:40,278
We stand next to each other,
it looks like he's kidnapping me.

422
00:29:40,446 --> 00:29:42,280
- What?
- You always do this.

423
00:29:42,448 --> 00:29:45,491
You always find something wrong
with everybody who likes you.

424
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:47,743
And I date guys
who have real problems.

425
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:50,204
I date guys who steal my credit card,

426
00:29:50,372 --> 00:29:53,040
and then they tell me it's my fault
because I left it out.

427
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:55,668
You find these perfect guys,

428
00:29:55,836 --> 00:29:59,380
and then you're like,
"It'll never work, he's too happy."

429
00:29:59,548 --> 00:30:01,716
What's up, Dr. Metzner?

430
00:30:02,718 --> 00:30:06,220
Did I just say "What's up"
to Stephen Metzner?

431
00:30:06,388 --> 00:30:08,764
That was really hard to watch.

432
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:13,394
Look, I know I'm supposed
to want to be in a relationship.

433
00:30:13,562 --> 00:30:17,231
But I'd just end up with a broken heart
and a bunch of his old T-shirts.

434
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:19,859
- Just from a purely logical aspect...
- What are you doing?

435
00:30:20,027 --> 00:30:22,528
- I'm texting him.
- Of course you are.

436
00:30:37,711 --> 00:30:40,046
You know, you shouldn't have
gotten her a balloon actually.

437
00:30:40,214 --> 00:30:42,256
Who do you think you are,
the old guy from Up?

438
00:30:42,424 --> 00:30:44,217
You told me to get her a balloon.

439
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:48,054
Well, I didn't think you'd actually
do it. It's a terrible idea.

440
00:30:48,222 --> 00:30:49,639
Listen. Hey, nobody knows about this,

441
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:51,849
- so don't say anything to anyone. OK?
- All right, I won't.

442
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:55,895
- It's from Emma.
- What's it say?

443
00:30:56,063 --> 00:30:59,607
- "Where are you?"
- What are you writing?

444
00:31:00,943 --> 00:31:03,778
"Hi, how are you doing?"
And then a winky face.

445
00:31:03,946 --> 00:31:05,947
No, Adam, it's after 10pm.

446
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:08,157
Come on, the "Where are you?" text
is like saying:

447
00:31:08,325 --> 00:31:10,409
"Hey, I want to have sex with you,

448
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:12,328
but I just need to know
how drunk you are."

449
00:31:12,496 --> 00:31:14,163
Hey.

450
00:31:14,331 --> 00:31:16,582
Did you fuck Emma
and then bring her a balloon?

451
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:18,626
What? Did you tell him?

452
00:31:18,794 --> 00:31:20,253
No! Yes!

453
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:24,382
- You can't tell anyone.
- She just texted him, "Where are you?"

454
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:25,883
Oh, she wants the dick.

455
00:31:26,802 --> 00:31:30,096
Adam, you want to come back strong
here. Go from a position of power.

456
00:31:30,264 --> 00:31:33,975
Something like, "Where am I?
Why don't you check your underpants."

457
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:36,018
- Yeah. Don't write that.
- Yeah!

458
00:31:36,186 --> 00:31:39,230
- I would never write that.
- See, I like to be kind of scary.

459
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:42,191
Like, "Boo! Here comes my dick."

460
00:31:42,818 --> 00:31:45,319
Did you have sex with some girl
and give her a balloon?

461
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:49,740
Can we not tell everyone?

462
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:52,034
I apologize.

463
00:31:52,202 --> 00:31:53,995
So, what'd you write back?

464
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:56,163
"Hi."

465
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:04,422
- Yeah, that could work.
- Yeah, it's not bad. "Hi" is fine.

466
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:16,851
There were so many
interesting things going on.

467
00:32:17,019 --> 00:32:19,729
- Yeah.
- That flippy thing, what was that?

468
00:32:20,606 --> 00:32:23,816
Sure, I just, I don't know,
I had an idea, I just went with it.

469
00:32:23,984 --> 00:32:26,611
- That was a really good call.
- Thank you.

470
00:32:32,826 --> 00:32:34,827
We probably shouldn't snuggle.

471
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:38,706
Yeah. That just felt wrong.

472
00:32:39,583 --> 00:32:41,292
I should head out.

473
00:32:42,044 --> 00:32:44,253
- Already?
- Yeah.

474
00:32:46,006 --> 00:32:47,882
You want to grab a muffin
or something?

475
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:50,593
I can't. I have to go to work.

476
00:32:50,761 --> 00:32:56,098
OK. You know,
I don't want to freak you out, but...

477
00:32:56,266 --> 00:32:59,018
...I'd love to hang out with you
in the daytime sometime.

478
00:32:59,728 --> 00:33:02,021
It's not really possible.
I have no time.

479
00:33:02,731 --> 00:33:06,525
I work 80 hours a week,
doing 36-hour shifts.

480
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:11,197
What I need is someone who's gonna be
in my bed at 2am,

481
00:33:11,365 --> 00:33:14,617
who I don't have to lie
to or eat breakfast with.

482
00:33:14,785 --> 00:33:17,870
I hate breakfast. And lying.

483
00:33:18,622 --> 00:33:20,706
I also hate war.

484
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:32,802
Do you want to do this?

485
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:35,554
Do what?

486
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:40,685
Use each other for sex,
at all hours of the day and night.

487
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:42,520
Nothing else.

488
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:51,529
- Yeah, I could do that.
- Good.

489
00:33:55,492 --> 00:33:56,784
It's gonna be fun.

490
00:33:56,952 --> 00:33:59,829
- You know this is never gonna work.
- Why not?

491
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:02,790
Because clearly you're gonna
fall in love with me.

492
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:06,127
Oh, really?
Well, then we just do this

493
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:09,714
until one of us feels something more,
and then we stop.

494
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:13,426
- Well, it won't be me.
- It won't be me.

495
00:34:17,973 --> 00:34:19,724
Good luck with that.

496
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:24,228
- Hey.
- Hey.

497
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,023
We're sex friends.

498
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:31,110
Just friends who have sex.

499
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:33,487
That's not possible.

500
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:55,593
I'm going to distribute these
for an hour or so.

501
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:12,193
Listen, we should keep this simple.

502
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:15,279
I mean, maybe we should establish
some ground rules.

503
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:17,573
Ground rules. Good idea.

504
00:35:17,741 --> 00:35:21,035
OK, well, we can start
with no fighting.

505
00:35:21,203 --> 00:35:24,121
- No lying.
- Those are good ones.

506
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:28,167
No jealousy, no staring deeply
into each other's eyes.

507
00:35:28,335 --> 00:35:31,212
Don't list me as your emergency contact.
I won't come.

508
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:33,047
Isn't that against
your Hippocratic oath?

509
00:35:33,215 --> 00:35:34,256
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

510
00:35:34,424 --> 00:35:36,467
- I'd let you die.
- Oh, yeah?

511
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:40,054
I'll be back in like... an hour.

512
00:35:40,931 --> 00:35:42,431
Have fun.

513
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:45,017
I'm just getting some yogurt.

514
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:49,355
God, I am single as fuck.

515
00:36:00,033 --> 00:36:01,450
Oh, my God.

516
00:36:01,618 --> 00:36:04,161
It looks like it's coming right at me.

517
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,206
Hey, one more thing.

518
00:36:07,374 --> 00:36:09,083
Don't call my penis cute.

519
00:36:09,251 --> 00:36:11,168
Even if it's dressed up
like a Care Bear,

520
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:13,546
and it's giving you a Care Stare.

521
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:16,090
Don't dress up your penis. Ever.

522
00:36:27,227 --> 00:36:31,605
Does your insurance
cover invasive procedures?

523
00:36:31,773 --> 00:36:34,233
OK. OK, this is getting
a little too realistic.

524
00:36:34,943 --> 00:36:36,110
Trust me.

525
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:50,583
I can't focus on my porn with all this
real sex going on around me!

526
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:02,344
Yes, I'm ready.

527
00:37:02,512 --> 00:37:04,471
What are you doing?!

528
00:37:07,392 --> 00:37:10,269
I just friended you. Do you think
you're gonna confirm or ignore?

529
00:37:10,437 --> 00:37:13,063
Oh, I'm gonna confirm.
For sure.

530
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:16,233
Yeah, look at you. Of course.

531
00:37:21,323 --> 00:37:22,948
Anytime.
Need some help?

532
00:37:23,116 --> 00:37:25,868
Oh, beautiful! Beautiful!

533
00:37:38,632 --> 00:37:40,966
...the tomatoes are Australian.

534
00:37:49,351 --> 00:37:50,976
- What was that?
- What?

535
00:37:51,144 --> 00:37:54,897
- Are you being jealous?
- Of that guy? Come on.

536
00:37:55,065 --> 00:37:57,858
Look, even if I did like him,
it doesn't change what we're doing.

537
00:37:58,026 --> 00:38:02,237
- Ah, so you like him.
- Adam, I'm not yours.

538
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:04,907
No, of course not.
Why would I think that?

539
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:10,245
Wow. Prius. Nice.

540
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:14,375
- It's kind of girly, but nice, huh?
- What do you drive?

541
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:18,587
Just an old BMW.
Five series. Right there.

542
00:38:18,755 --> 00:38:21,590
Oh, yeah, sure.
I actually paid for mine.

543
00:38:21,758 --> 00:38:24,343
I didn't take it from my parents.

544
00:38:24,511 --> 00:38:26,804
Yeah, I paid for mine, too.

545
00:38:26,972 --> 00:38:28,681
Oh, yeah?

546
00:38:30,892 --> 00:38:33,310
You're a big guy.
Do you work out?

547
00:38:33,478 --> 00:38:35,854
Oh. I row.

548
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:37,398
Like boats?

549
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:40,901
- I rowed crew at Harvard.
- Oh, Harvard.

550
00:38:41,069 --> 00:38:42,861
What were you, a cocksman?
What do they say?

551
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:44,905
- What do they call it?
- Coxswain.

552
00:38:45,073 --> 00:38:48,867
No. You know, I get it, right?
That you're sleeping with Emma?

553
00:38:49,786 --> 00:38:50,995
I what?

554
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:53,288
That you and Emma
have sex sometimes. I get it.

555
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:55,916
She's tired, she calls you up,
you drive over,

556
00:38:56,084 --> 00:38:58,002
and have sex for, I'm guessing,
ten minutes.

557
00:38:58,169 --> 00:38:59,503
Think that's gonna last?

558
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:03,799
I don't know what you're talking about.

559
00:39:03,967 --> 00:39:06,468
Sure you do.
And that's fine, for now.

560
00:39:06,636 --> 00:39:09,972
But you should just know that I'm gonna
be there right next to her every day,

561
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:12,599
using big words...

562
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:14,852
...saving people's lives.

563
00:39:16,271 --> 00:39:18,188
Then, when she's done having
her fun with you, she's gonna

564
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:22,359
come running to me, because
I'm a grownup, and I have a real job.

565
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:26,447
I can actually take care of her,
you know?

566
00:39:27,741 --> 00:39:29,992
I'm the guy she marries, Adam.

567
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:35,080
You're the guy she fucked a couple
of times in the handicapped bathroom.

568
00:39:53,308 --> 00:39:56,977
- What's this?
- These are my feet, Adam.

569
00:39:57,145 --> 00:40:00,397
- They're fantastic.
- No, this.

570
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:02,691
That's your script.

571
00:40:02,859 --> 00:40:04,651
Your dad told me to give it to you.

572
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:07,488
Yeah, he read it,
and he gave you notes, and...

573
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:11,492
I'm not saying Alvin and I
did mushrooms together,

574
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:13,952
but I'm not prepared
to say that we didn't.

575
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,455
I know that you have issues
with your dad, and that's cool,

576
00:40:16,623 --> 00:40:19,792
but he really likes you
and he definitely likes me,

577
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:22,669
and we were just jamming ideas
and goofing around

578
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:25,130
and tripping our balls off.

579
00:40:26,007 --> 00:40:29,843
Hey. So... I really feel
like it needs to be more ghetto.

580
00:40:30,011 --> 00:40:34,306
You know, like, more crunk?
Can you work it out? Thanks.

581
00:40:34,474 --> 00:40:35,849
- Hey. Nice moves.
- Hey.

582
00:40:36,017 --> 00:40:38,811
I know you were trying really hard
out there, but it just didn't work.

583
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:41,772
Hey, would you ever? I...

584
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:44,024
I wrote an episode.

585
00:40:44,192 --> 00:40:47,986
- I used to write in college, so...
- OK.

586
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:49,822
I'm gonna have to stop
you right there.

587
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:52,282
- Not your job.
- Yeah.

588
00:40:53,326 --> 00:40:56,078
Hey. I'm, like, actually
one of those freaks who reads things,

589
00:40:56,246 --> 00:40:58,664
so if you wanted to give it to me,
that's cool.

590
00:40:58,832 --> 00:41:00,374
- Really?
- Yeah.

591
00:41:00,542 --> 00:41:01,708
- Thank you.
- Sure.

592
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:04,670
Megan listens to me.
Sometimes.

593
00:41:05,922 --> 00:41:09,383
Victoria! Seriously?
Like, I can see you smoking right there.

594
00:41:09,551 --> 00:41:11,969
Put it out!
I'm not gonna chase you.

595
00:41:12,846 --> 00:41:17,516
I'm not gonna... I'm not gonna...
Victoria! Hey!

596
00:41:22,272 --> 00:41:23,730
Emma!

597
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:25,858
Katie, is everything OK?
I got your message.

598
00:41:26,025 --> 00:41:28,735
Emma, I have really good news.

599
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:30,904
OK, it happened yesterday
after the picnic,

600
00:41:31,072 --> 00:41:33,532
but I wanted to tell you in person.

601
00:41:35,952 --> 00:41:37,161
Oh, my God.

602
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:39,580
I'm getting married.

603
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:40,956
I'm getting married!

604
00:41:41,124 --> 00:41:43,500
- You're getting married.
- I'm getting married!

605
00:41:45,253 --> 00:41:47,880
Mom is so excited.

606
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:50,883
She was like screaming
and crying last night.

607
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:53,594
And she's gonna fly down with Bones
and help me shop for the dress.

608
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:57,639
With who? "Bones"?
Who's Bones?

609
00:41:57,807 --> 00:42:00,392
- Oh, crap.
- Katie, who's Bones?

610
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:03,103
He's Mom's friend.

611
00:42:03,271 --> 00:42:06,440
I wasn't supposed to tell you
about it. Crap.

612
00:42:06,608 --> 00:42:11,028
She has a boyfriend?
Named Bones?

613
00:42:11,196 --> 00:42:13,780
- What is he, a drifter?
- No.

614
00:42:13,948 --> 00:42:15,407
Why didn't she tell me?

615
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:18,368
Well, Emma...

616
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:22,122
You're so good at being alone.
Mom and I aren't like that.

617
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:25,375
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It just is true.

618
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:28,295
Look, Katie.

619
00:42:28,463 --> 00:42:31,715
You're 22. Do you really think
you're ready to quit school?

620
00:42:31,883 --> 00:42:34,176
I love him.

621
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,059
Tea for your 'gina.

622
00:42:43,311 --> 00:42:46,230
Thanks. My sister's getting married.

623
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:47,981
- Yes, we know that.
- We heard.

624
00:42:48,149 --> 00:42:50,150
Oh, shut up, Emma.

625
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:51,693
Did you take your Pamprin?

626
00:42:51,861 --> 00:42:53,654
- Leave me alone.
- You leave me alone.

627
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:55,697
I love it when we're all
on the same cycle.

628
00:42:55,865 --> 00:42:57,658
We all get to be
passive-aggressive and fight.

629
00:42:57,825 --> 00:42:59,785
You are not even a woman.

630
00:43:01,329 --> 00:43:02,913
Who is that?

631
00:43:05,792 --> 00:43:07,000
Hello?

632
00:43:07,168 --> 00:43:09,211
Hey, it's Adam.

633
00:43:10,755 --> 00:43:12,172
Are you kidding me?

634
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:15,050
Go away.

635
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:17,844
I've got cupcakes.

636
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:34,194
Hello, everyone.

637
00:43:34,362 --> 00:43:37,781
I told you not to come.
It's not safe in here.

638
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:40,033
Do you think that you have
red velvet in there?

639
00:43:40,201 --> 00:43:41,702
I might.

640
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:45,580
Let's take a look
and see what we have here.

641
00:43:46,124 --> 00:43:48,667
Shira, chocolate. Now.

642
00:43:49,294 --> 00:43:52,754
I understand what's going on.
You're all on the same cycle.

643
00:43:52,922 --> 00:43:54,881
This is very exciting.

644
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:58,802
Your uterine walls will be shedding
for the next three to five days.

645
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:01,430
Nice memorization.
Did you Google that?

646
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:03,557
I may have.

647
00:44:03,725 --> 00:44:07,519
Because you're women.
And I think that's a beautiful thing.

648
00:44:08,896 --> 00:44:11,857
It's like a crime scene in my pants.

649
00:44:12,025 --> 00:44:15,610
Oh. I also...

650
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:18,530
...made you this.

651
00:44:18,698 --> 00:44:21,074
To help soothe your womb.

652
00:44:22,535 --> 00:44:24,161
It's a mix.

653
00:44:24,329 --> 00:44:28,081
"Even Flow,"
"Red Red Wine."

654
00:44:28,249 --> 00:44:30,083
"Sunday Bloody Sunday"?

655
00:44:31,002 --> 00:44:32,669
Adam.

656
00:44:32,837 --> 00:44:34,880
Did you make me a period mix?

657
00:44:36,132 --> 00:44:37,716
That's so romantic.

658
00:44:37,884 --> 00:44:39,926
Frank Sinatra.

659
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:42,179
"I've Got The World On A String."

660
00:44:42,347 --> 00:44:44,264
It's a classic.

661
00:44:46,476 --> 00:44:49,436
Keep, keep bleedin' love

662
00:44:49,604 --> 00:44:51,104
I keep bleedin'...

663
00:44:51,272 --> 00:44:53,398
Get that shit away from me.

664
00:44:53,566 --> 00:44:56,276
Come on, it's soup.
It's good for your uterus.

665
00:44:56,444 --> 00:44:59,196
Just take it,
or I'm gonna keep singing.

666
00:45:03,576 --> 00:45:07,954
Keep bleedin',
I keep, keep bleedin' love

667
00:45:23,221 --> 00:45:24,930
Oh, shit.

668
00:45:25,598 --> 00:45:27,265
Oh, Adam.

669
00:45:28,393 --> 00:45:30,644
Adam.

670
00:45:30,812 --> 00:45:32,312
What?

671
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:37,651
We fell asleep. We were spooning.

672
00:45:39,821 --> 00:45:41,655
- We were?
- Yeah.

673
00:45:41,823 --> 00:45:44,825
And we were spooning
with our clothes on,

674
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:47,994
which is like ten times worse.

675
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:49,996
- Oh, shit.
- Yeah.

676
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:53,625
- Fully clothed spoon.
- This is bad.

677
00:45:57,422 --> 00:46:00,757
This is my fault.
I should not have made you soup.

678
00:46:01,634 --> 00:46:05,303
- What are we gonna do?
- About what?

679
00:46:05,471 --> 00:46:08,890
Maybe we should...
Maybe we should stop for a while.

680
00:46:09,892 --> 00:46:12,602
No, we're not stopping.

681
00:46:13,354 --> 00:46:17,149
Yeah, well, I don't know.

682
00:46:18,943 --> 00:46:20,902
Go hook up with someone else.

683
00:46:23,281 --> 00:46:25,615
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, go...

684
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:28,785
Go to the nearest bar
and have sex with a stranger.

685
00:46:28,953 --> 00:46:31,413
- You're kidding?
- No.

686
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:41,089
- This is crazy.
- You made me a period mix.

687
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:47,429
Adam, this is an emergency.

688
00:46:47,597 --> 00:46:49,890
- So you just want me to go?
- Yeah.

689
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:52,434
- Just have sex with a random woman?
- Yeah, go.

690
00:46:52,602 --> 00:46:54,311
Like a sexual woman?

691
00:46:54,479 --> 00:46:56,062
Yes!

692
00:46:58,065 --> 00:47:00,609
I'll go have sex with someone, too.

693
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:09,326
OK.

694
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:15,081
- No, this is gonna be good for us.
- Yeah. It's great.

695
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:22,797
Great. Well done. Well played.

696
00:47:23,758 --> 00:47:25,258
Bye.

697
00:47:27,178 --> 00:47:29,179
I haven't seen her in two weeks, so...

698
00:47:30,890 --> 00:47:32,432
She said I should hook up
with other people.

699
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:33,850
I mean, what am I supposed to do
with that?

700
00:47:34,018 --> 00:47:37,395
- Look at my face.
- No, I get it. I just...

701
00:47:37,563 --> 00:47:39,147
Look at my face.
What does my face say?

702
00:47:39,315 --> 00:47:41,608
Yeah, Adam, come on,
you're living every man's dreams.

703
00:47:41,776 --> 00:47:43,485
I mean, she wants you to hook up
with other girls.

704
00:47:43,653 --> 00:47:45,695
- Yes.
- Look, in ten years from now,

705
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:47,739
you're gonna be having sex
with your wife.

706
00:47:47,907 --> 00:47:49,699
And it's gonna be
in the missionary position.

707
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:52,160
- And one of you is going to be asleep.
- Yep.

708
00:47:52,328 --> 00:47:54,329
And you're gonna think
back to this moment,

709
00:47:54,497 --> 00:47:57,290
and you're gonna call me up, crying.

710
00:47:57,458 --> 00:48:00,835
And I'm gonna laugh in your face, Adam.
I'm sorry, but it's what I'm gonna do.

711
00:48:01,003 --> 00:48:02,504
This is a gift right now.

712
00:48:02,672 --> 00:48:04,464
You don't even have to have
breakfast with her.

713
00:48:04,632 --> 00:48:07,133
I know. I get that. I just...

714
00:48:07,301 --> 00:48:09,135
Look at my face.

715
00:48:11,013 --> 00:48:13,139
You bringing Adam
to the Christmas party tonight?

716
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:16,393
No. Things were getting too intense,
so we decided not to see each other

717
00:48:16,561 --> 00:48:18,311
until we hook up with other people.

718
00:48:18,479 --> 00:48:23,149
OK. Yes. Good.
We are getting laid tonight, right?

719
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:25,652
This is gonna be like Sideways,
except that you're Paul Giamatti,

720
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:27,988
- and I'm the guy that gets laid.
- I can't get laid?

721
00:48:28,155 --> 00:48:30,782
No. Tonight is about me, Emma.
All right? I'm feeling hot.

722
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:32,784
I'm feeling good.
I am wearing bikini bottoms

723
00:48:32,952 --> 00:48:34,411
because my other underwear is dirty.

724
00:48:34,579 --> 00:48:37,330
All right, we're hot. You feel hot?

725
00:48:37,498 --> 00:48:39,499
No one threw up on me today.

726
00:48:39,667 --> 00:48:43,044
We're sluts, Emma!
We're dirty, dirty, sluts!

727
00:48:43,212 --> 00:48:45,672
- OK.
- Remember, we're sluts!

728
00:48:58,853 --> 00:49:00,687
Good evening, sir.

729
00:49:02,815 --> 00:49:05,483
No, I got that! I got that, pal.
That's gonna be me.

730
00:49:08,696 --> 00:49:11,698
- Did you just open the car door for me?
- Yes, I did.

731
00:49:11,866 --> 00:49:14,367
No one's ever done
that for me before. Do it again.

732
00:49:14,535 --> 00:49:16,036
All right.

733
00:49:19,999 --> 00:49:22,334
- How's that?
- It's amazing.

734
00:49:23,502 --> 00:49:24,669
Can I have your arm?

735
00:49:26,839 --> 00:49:29,549
So, when I have to tell someone
that someone they loved died,

736
00:49:29,717 --> 00:49:32,552
it's hard, you know?
Sometimes I laugh.

737
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:35,055
Because it's kind of weird.

738
00:49:35,222 --> 00:49:36,389
Very nice.

739
00:49:36,557 --> 00:49:40,268
- Oh, don't even think about it.
- I'm gonna go talk to him.

740
00:49:40,436 --> 00:49:42,062
Emma, no.

741
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:45,106
I'm gonna do this.

742
00:49:45,274 --> 00:49:48,151
Emma, think about your career.
Do not do this.

743
00:49:51,113 --> 00:49:52,989
- Dr. Metzner.
- Yes?

744
00:49:53,157 --> 00:49:55,033
Hi. I'm Emma Kurtzman.

745
00:49:56,077 --> 00:50:01,956
I've been ho, ho, hoping
that I'd get the chance to talk to you.

746
00:50:04,752 --> 00:50:07,545
- Does anyone here need a drink?
- Patrón!

747
00:50:08,798 --> 00:50:10,340
How are you guys doing?

748
00:50:10,508 --> 00:50:12,884
- Joy, come join us.
- Hey, Joy.

749
00:50:13,052 --> 00:50:14,427
- What's up?
- I have to work.

750
00:50:14,595 --> 00:50:15,929
- Come on, just sit down for a second.
- Sit down.

751
00:50:16,097 --> 00:50:17,931
- OK.
- Come on. Here. You take that one.

752
00:50:18,099 --> 00:50:19,182
- We're just hanging.
- Thank you.

753
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:21,017
Screw the customers.

754
00:50:21,185 --> 00:50:23,770
She is so good at impressions.

755
00:50:23,938 --> 00:50:26,356
- Do an impression, then.
- Yes, do an impression.

756
00:50:26,524 --> 00:50:27,816
All right, guess who this is.

757
00:50:30,778 --> 00:50:32,278
Dad!

758
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,989
- Dad!
- Oh, my God, that's so cute.

759
00:50:35,157 --> 00:50:36,116
- I don't know.
- Come on.

760
00:50:36,283 --> 00:50:37,867
- Where are you?
- I don't know.

761
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:41,413
- Where are you, Dad?
- It's Nemo.

762
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:43,623
- Yes!
- Yeah.

763
00:50:43,791 --> 00:50:44,958
- Nemo.
- Amazing.

764
00:50:45,126 --> 00:50:48,086
I don't know why I didn't get that.
How did you know that?

765
00:50:48,254 --> 00:50:50,922
'Cause I've seen it a thousand times.
That's how.

766
00:50:51,090 --> 00:50:53,883
- Drew Barrymore.
- I don't know if I'm drunk enough.

767
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:55,677
- Come on.
- You can't do Drew Barrymore.

768
00:50:55,845 --> 00:50:57,762
Oh, but she can.

769
00:50:57,930 --> 00:51:03,601
Happy holidays.
I was in The Wedding Singer.

770
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:05,145
That's it. That's all I have.

771
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:07,480
That was kind of an amazing
Drew Barrymore.

772
00:51:07,648 --> 00:51:09,482
You kind of even looked
like her when you did it.

773
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:12,610
Oh, my God, Joy.
I love you so much.

774
00:51:14,321 --> 00:51:15,447
You do?

775
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:17,657
Yeah.

776
00:51:17,825 --> 00:51:19,200
Lisa...

777
00:51:19,368 --> 00:51:21,828
...I love you.

778
00:51:21,996 --> 00:51:24,831
- Wait.
- I'm seriously in love with you.

779
00:51:24,999 --> 00:51:26,750
Wait. Why didn't you tell me sooner?

780
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:30,336
- I didn't have the courage.
- Oh, my God. This is amazing.

781
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:34,424
- God, you look so beautiful.
- And your eyes are so pretty.

782
00:51:34,592 --> 00:51:37,427
- Have you got?
- Let's do this.

783
00:51:37,595 --> 00:51:39,596
Wallace, could you
take a picture of this?

784
00:51:39,764 --> 00:51:42,307
Yeah, Wallace, I got a camera
right here, if you just wanna...

785
00:51:42,475 --> 00:51:45,518
No problem at all.
Just get a little closer, ladies.

786
00:51:45,686 --> 00:51:48,688
All right. Everybody smile.

787
00:51:48,856 --> 00:51:50,857
Happy ho-lidays!

788
00:51:58,282 --> 00:51:59,532
Hey, hey!

789
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:01,701
Merry Christmas. Happy holidays.

790
00:52:01,869 --> 00:52:03,328
Can I get you a dri?

791
00:52:07,416 --> 00:52:09,501
You want to get out of here?

792
00:52:10,503 --> 00:52:11,753
Yes. Yeah.

793
00:52:11,921 --> 00:52:13,797
I'll get my stuff.

794
00:52:41,075 --> 00:52:43,535
Listen, don't fuck one of those girls.

795
00:52:43,702 --> 00:52:47,622
They're not... they're not nice.
They're not nice girls.

796
00:52:48,916 --> 00:52:51,000
What? Emma?

797
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:52,710
Is that you?

798
00:52:53,879 --> 00:52:55,296
Katie!

799
00:52:55,464 --> 00:52:58,675
Yeah, hi. What are you doing?
Where are you?

800
00:52:58,843 --> 00:53:01,928
I'm just studying
for the doctor test.

801
00:53:02,096 --> 00:53:03,555
You're coming tomorrow, right?

802
00:53:03,722 --> 00:53:05,431
Hold on.

803
00:53:06,976 --> 00:53:08,059
Hey, Adam.

804
00:53:08,227 --> 00:53:09,853
I am following
your instructions diligently.

805
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:13,106
- Put that away!
- Who are you talking to?

806
00:53:19,864 --> 00:53:22,031
Are you there?
You're not there, are you?

807
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:27,704
Taxi! Taxi!

808
00:53:33,919 --> 00:53:35,461
Take me to Adam's house.

809
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:38,423
- OK, ma'am, where's that?
- Where Adam lives.

810
00:53:38,591 --> 00:53:40,383
- All right...
- Just go. Go.

811
00:53:40,551 --> 00:53:42,343
OK, I'm going.

812
00:53:57,526 --> 00:54:01,279
Got a cocktail for the ladies.

813
00:54:01,447 --> 00:54:03,948
That's my Christopher Walken.

814
00:54:04,658 --> 00:54:09,037
Yeah. I'll just set these
over here and...

815
00:54:10,414 --> 00:54:13,541
...then we can all sort
of involve ourselves in...

816
00:54:13,709 --> 00:54:15,752
OK, let's...

817
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:19,047
Well, you guys are doing
a really good job.

818
00:54:19,214 --> 00:54:21,174
I'll just be over here if you need me.

819
00:54:21,342 --> 00:54:22,717
Adam!

820
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:26,304
Adam Franklin!

821
00:54:28,182 --> 00:54:30,683
Adam! Franklin!

822
00:54:31,226 --> 00:54:32,977
OK.

823
00:54:33,145 --> 00:54:35,772
Just keep up the good work, ladies.

824
00:54:43,781 --> 00:54:45,823
What are? What are you?

825
00:54:47,242 --> 00:54:48,534
Hey.

826
00:54:48,702 --> 00:54:50,787
Are you?

827
00:54:50,955 --> 00:54:53,665
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

828
00:54:57,127 --> 00:54:59,629
What's going on?

829
00:54:59,797 --> 00:55:02,340
- This is Joy.
- I'm Joy. Hi.

830
00:55:03,592 --> 00:55:06,761
- Good for you.
- Adam?

831
00:55:08,389 --> 00:55:10,181
And this is Lisa.

832
00:55:11,767 --> 00:55:15,561
You are such an overachiever.

833
00:55:15,729 --> 00:55:17,021
Thank you.

834
00:55:17,189 --> 00:55:18,898
No, we don't need her.
Make her leave.

835
00:55:19,066 --> 00:55:21,734
No. You leave.

836
00:55:22,695 --> 00:55:24,988
Are you trying to get rid of us?

837
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:26,781
You look like a pumpkin, bitch!

838
00:55:26,949 --> 00:55:29,742
- This is amazing.
- Oh, you make... Hey!

839
00:55:31,245 --> 00:55:33,329
OK. I got this.

840
00:55:33,497 --> 00:55:37,375
I got this. You just... calm down.

841
00:55:40,879 --> 00:55:43,589
But we don't look
anything like pumpkins.

842
00:55:43,757 --> 00:55:47,176
I know. She probably forgot
to take her meds.

843
00:55:47,344 --> 00:55:50,596
You know, for your own safety,
you'd better get your stuff and go.

844
00:55:50,764 --> 00:55:52,056
Thanks.

845
00:55:53,017 --> 00:55:55,601
Watch out, though.
She could be anywhere.

846
00:55:55,769 --> 00:55:58,688
She's quick. Like a puma.

847
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:02,567
You're so mean!

848
00:56:02,735 --> 00:56:07,447
Ring, ring! It's the pumpkin patch!
They want their pumpkins back!

849
00:56:07,614 --> 00:56:09,866
- We're not pumpkins!
- We're ladies!

850
00:56:10,034 --> 00:56:12,452
But you're so orange.

851
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:15,079
Hey, someone call Charlie Brown!

852
00:56:15,247 --> 00:56:17,707
We found the Great Pumpkin!

853
00:56:17,875 --> 00:56:19,876
Ow! Don't! Don't!

854
00:56:27,134 --> 00:56:29,594
You're crazy.

855
00:56:29,762 --> 00:56:32,263
I felt like Flavor Flav.

856
00:56:32,431 --> 00:56:37,310
- I can't believe you chose those girls.
- Are you jealous?

857
00:56:37,478 --> 00:56:41,272
Don't do that.
Don't just disappear like that on me.

858
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:44,150
- You told me to.
- You shouldn't listen to me.

859
00:56:44,318 --> 00:56:46,027
Fine, I won't.

860
00:56:54,161 --> 00:56:57,580
- Did you smell my hair?
- No.

861
00:57:08,092 --> 00:57:10,009
- What did you want to talk to me about?
- Wait. Just hang out here.

862
00:57:10,177 --> 00:57:11,636
Right here?

863
00:57:11,804 --> 00:57:13,179
Oh, man.

864
00:57:13,764 --> 00:57:15,014
Surprise!

865
00:57:15,182 --> 00:57:17,934
Happy birthday!

866
00:57:28,362 --> 00:57:31,864
As the days of the year roll by

867
00:57:33,158 --> 00:57:38,037
There's one that brings a tear
to a daddy's eye

868
00:57:38,789 --> 00:57:41,499
'Cause I'm so happy

869
00:57:41,667 --> 00:57:44,836
To be your pappy

870
00:57:45,003 --> 00:57:49,132
Today and I'll tell you why

871
00:57:51,677 --> 00:57:54,345
It's your birthday

872
00:57:54,513 --> 00:57:56,973
Baby boy

873
00:57:57,683 --> 00:58:00,393
- It's your birthday
- Birthday

874
00:58:00,561 --> 00:58:02,895
Birthday boy

875
00:58:03,063 --> 00:58:05,731
- Happy birthday, happy birthday
- Hap... py!

876
00:58:05,899 --> 00:58:07,900
- Happy birthday, happy birthday
- Birth... day!

877
00:58:08,068 --> 00:58:10,444
Happy birthday

878
00:58:10,612 --> 00:58:11,737
To you

879
00:58:11,905 --> 00:58:13,322
Everybody!

880
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:17,410
Happy birthday

881
00:58:17,578 --> 00:58:21,247
To you!

882
00:58:29,047 --> 00:58:31,799
Blow it out! Blow it out!
Oh, Adam, happy birthday.

883
00:58:31,967 --> 00:58:34,093
- We're so proud of you.
- Make a wish.

884
00:58:42,269 --> 00:58:44,687
Guys, you get a five-minute warning.

885
00:58:44,855 --> 00:58:46,439
- OK?
- No, he's ten-one.

886
00:58:46,607 --> 00:58:48,566
I already texted him.

887
00:58:48,734 --> 00:58:53,654
- So, all is forgiven?
- No. Nothing is forgiven.

888
00:58:54,448 --> 00:58:57,116
Adam, don't you think
it's been weird for me, too?

889
00:58:57,284 --> 00:59:00,745
Knowing that... my own son
had sex with my girlfriend?

890
00:59:02,289 --> 00:59:04,582
But I got over it.
You should, too.

891
00:59:04,750 --> 00:59:06,292
Excuse me!
Can I have your autograph, please?

892
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:07,960
- Mine, too, please.
- Certainly.

893
00:59:08,128 --> 00:59:10,922
Listen, let me take you
to a nice birthday dinner tonight.

894
00:59:11,089 --> 00:59:14,634
You, me and Vanessa. We have
something we want to talk to you about.

895
00:59:14,801 --> 00:59:15,927
- Something?
- Yeah.

896
00:59:16,094 --> 00:59:19,472
- Like what?
- Just something important, OK?

897
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:21,515
- Please don't do this.
- 8:30, STK.

898
00:59:21,683 --> 00:59:25,019
All right? Be there.
Bring anyone you want, all right?

899
00:59:25,187 --> 00:59:27,563
- Bye, everyone. Thank you.
- Oh, thank you so much for coming.

900
00:59:27,731 --> 00:59:29,190
It's been an honor.

901
00:59:29,358 --> 00:59:33,152
- Great Scott!
- Bravo! Bravo!

902
00:59:37,157 --> 00:59:39,575
What the fuck?

903
00:59:39,743 --> 00:59:42,453
- What happened?
- Oh, my.

904
00:59:42,621 --> 00:59:45,414
Are you OK?
Are you OK? What happened?

905
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:47,708
- Give me that!
- That's my phone!

906
00:59:47,876 --> 00:59:50,753
Fuck you, Chuck!
You're very talented, but fuck you!

907
00:59:50,921 --> 00:59:52,255
Can we get a medic, please?

908
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:55,841
Try to use it as little as possible.

909
00:59:56,009 --> 00:59:59,095
- No sports or working out for a while.
- Dr. Metzner?

910
01:00:01,348 --> 01:00:04,183
Adam, what's going on?
What happened?

911
01:00:04,351 --> 01:00:07,687
He sprained his wrist
punching a wall.

912
01:00:08,689 --> 01:00:10,898
You texted me that you were dying.

913
01:00:11,066 --> 01:00:12,608
It really hurt.

914
01:00:13,151 --> 01:00:16,529
I gave him some hydrocodone for the
night. It's a very strong painkiller.

915
01:00:16,697 --> 01:00:19,156
You might want to have
Dr. Kurtzman here drive you home.

916
01:00:20,784 --> 01:00:24,620
And here is a prescription
for an anti-inflammatory.

917
01:00:25,956 --> 01:00:27,665
Don't worry.
You're in good hands.

918
01:00:27,833 --> 01:00:29,792
Your girlfriend here is
a very talented doctor.

919
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:32,503
No. No, I'm... I'm not his girlfriend.

920
01:00:32,671 --> 01:00:34,463
She is not my girlfriend.

921
01:00:34,631 --> 01:00:38,175
Oh, sorry. I saw that he listed you
as an emergency contact.

922
01:00:39,970 --> 01:00:42,805
My mistake. Feel better.

923
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:47,184
Oh, by the way,
I enjoyed your dad's TV show.

924
01:00:47,352 --> 01:00:49,645
Great Scott. That's funny stuff.

925
01:00:50,355 --> 01:00:52,356
I'll tell him you said that.

926
01:00:57,446 --> 01:01:00,573
My dad invited me to dinner,

927
01:01:00,741 --> 01:01:02,742
and he's bringing Vanessa.

928
01:01:03,744 --> 01:01:06,454
- You have to come.
- No, I don't.

929
01:01:06,621 --> 01:01:08,873
I just worked 14 hours.
I'm not gonna meet your parents.

930
01:01:09,041 --> 01:01:11,917
You know what? Just help me.

931
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:17,923
These are really powerful painkillers.
I can't feel anything.

932
01:01:20,218 --> 01:01:21,552
Feel that?

933
01:01:23,722 --> 01:01:26,015
Yeah. I felt that.

934
01:01:26,183 --> 01:01:28,100
Happy birthday, Adam.

935
01:01:28,268 --> 01:01:30,603
I'm so glad you guys
could join us for dinner.

936
01:01:30,771 --> 01:01:33,439
Cheers. I'll come right back
to take your order.

937
01:01:34,399 --> 01:01:38,235
So, how you doing there, kiddo?

938
01:01:38,403 --> 01:01:41,864
Perfect, Dad.
Thank you for asking.

939
01:01:43,116 --> 01:01:44,784
How long have you two been together?

940
01:01:44,951 --> 01:01:46,702
Oh, we're not.

941
01:01:46,870 --> 01:01:50,164
- We're sex friends.
- Yeah. Yes, we are.

942
01:01:50,957 --> 01:01:54,460
Yeah, friends with benefits?
Fuck buddies?

943
01:01:55,962 --> 01:01:58,089
Great Scott!

944
01:01:59,007 --> 01:02:03,636
I know this might be hard,
but just because I'm your ex-girlfriend

945
01:02:03,804 --> 01:02:09,392
doesn't mean that you can't
look at me as a kind of... mum?

946
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:11,477
- Oh, boy.
- Especially because, well,

947
01:02:11,645 --> 01:02:17,566
Alvin and I have been talking about
creating new life together.

948
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:19,819
You see, we were at Burning Man.

949
01:02:19,986 --> 01:02:22,905
- And we were dressed up.
- Yeah. I was dressed as a fire bird.

950
01:02:23,073 --> 01:02:24,824
And what were you dressed as?

951
01:02:24,991 --> 01:02:28,494
I was naked. And we were just
out there in the desert,

952
01:02:28,662 --> 01:02:31,330
and he was burying
my bare body in the sand.

953
01:02:31,498 --> 01:02:34,834
Yeah. Pecking at it with my...
fire beak.

954
01:02:35,001 --> 01:02:36,919
And then I just thought,

955
01:02:37,087 --> 01:02:41,257
you know, what if all
these grains of sand,

956
01:02:41,425 --> 01:02:44,051
were actually babies?

957
01:02:44,678 --> 01:02:48,264
- And so we...
- We had this wonderful idea.

958
01:02:48,432 --> 01:02:52,560
And we... well,
we'd like your blessing, Adam.

959
01:02:52,727 --> 01:02:56,272
How do you feel about the two of us
having a baby together?

960
01:02:58,650 --> 01:02:59,733
Adam.

961
01:03:02,737 --> 01:03:05,281
This isn't really my place.
I mean, who am I?

962
01:03:05,449 --> 01:03:07,283
I just have sex
with your son sometimes.

963
01:03:07,451 --> 01:03:09,118
- But...
- Yes, she does.

964
01:03:09,661 --> 01:03:12,746
But... there is really no reason

965
01:03:12,914 --> 01:03:15,207
for you to bring a child
into this world,

966
01:03:15,375 --> 01:03:17,918
since you're acting
like children already.

967
01:03:18,086 --> 01:03:20,337
- That was really mean.
- Yeah.

968
01:03:21,298 --> 01:03:23,549
I'm mean. But you're fucking crazy.

969
01:03:23,717 --> 01:03:25,843
'Cause given the choice
between Adam and his dad,

970
01:03:26,011 --> 01:03:27,887
given the choice between Adam
and anyone, really,

971
01:03:28,054 --> 01:03:30,598
I'd choose Adam, every time.

972
01:03:33,101 --> 01:03:36,187
- Do you want to get out of here?
- Yep.

973
01:03:36,354 --> 01:03:38,355
Fuck this.

974
01:03:39,524 --> 01:03:41,692
Oh, by the way...

975
01:03:41,860 --> 01:03:43,652
...it's the best sex of my life.

976
01:03:47,782 --> 01:03:49,492
Great Scott!

977
01:03:56,625 --> 01:04:00,794
I have to say, this is probably
the best birthday dinner ever.

978
01:04:00,962 --> 01:04:02,880
I wanted to make it special.

979
01:04:03,048 --> 01:04:04,381
Yeah? Where's the cake?

980
01:04:05,425 --> 01:04:07,384
That comes later, baby.

981
01:04:10,931 --> 01:04:12,264
- Hey.
- What?

982
01:04:12,432 --> 01:04:15,935
Thank you for what you did
back at the restaurant.

983
01:04:34,496 --> 01:04:36,121
Go on a date with me.

984
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:39,041
You're heavily sedated.

985
01:04:39,209 --> 01:04:42,670
Come on, it's... it's one date.
Just do it.

986
01:04:42,837 --> 01:04:45,756
Why? So I can wear makeup
and act perfect all night?

987
01:04:45,924 --> 01:04:47,383
Yeah.

988
01:04:47,551 --> 01:04:51,470
I'll pick you up, and we can talk
about our favorite books

989
01:04:51,638 --> 01:04:54,348
and our favorite TV shows.

990
01:04:54,516 --> 01:04:57,017
I'll pay for everything,
and you can reward me

991
01:04:57,185 --> 01:04:59,979
with an over-the-jeans cock rub.

992
01:05:01,147 --> 01:05:02,356
Like a real date.

993
01:05:02,524 --> 01:05:05,943
- Is that really what you want?
- This Friday.

994
01:05:06,820 --> 01:05:08,362
This Friday is Valentine's Day.

995
01:05:08,530 --> 01:05:09,863
- Yeah.
- No.

996
01:05:10,031 --> 01:05:12,324
Go big or go home.
There'll be hearts,

997
01:05:12,492 --> 01:05:15,077
and maybe some flowers.

998
01:05:18,498 --> 01:05:19,665
One date.

999
01:05:23,712 --> 01:05:25,296
Fine.

1000
01:05:25,463 --> 01:05:31,343
- What?
- I'll go on a date with you.

1001
01:05:31,511 --> 01:05:34,138
- I thought that's what you said.
- But no flowers, OK?

1002
01:05:54,284 --> 01:05:56,076
You look amazing.

1003
01:05:56,244 --> 01:05:58,662
Thank you.

1004
01:06:02,375 --> 01:06:04,960
- You said no flowers.
- That's pretty cute.

1005
01:06:05,128 --> 01:06:06,962
Yeah, I'm pretty good at this.

1006
01:06:08,465 --> 01:06:10,466
Thank you.

1007
01:06:10,634 --> 01:06:14,970
I've had a really tough day,
so, I just won't...

1008
01:06:15,138 --> 01:06:17,765
I promise. It's about to get better.

1009
01:06:31,237 --> 01:06:34,573
- I made you a Valentine's Day card.
- What?

1010
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:39,078
It's perfect.

1011
01:06:39,245 --> 01:06:42,706
Can you read it for me?
Is that weird?

1012
01:06:44,584 --> 01:06:48,545
"You give me premature
ventricular contractions."

1013
01:06:49,923 --> 01:06:52,925
- I'm assuming that's a good thing?
- You make my heart skip a beat.

1014
01:06:55,428 --> 01:06:57,846
- Don't make fun of me.
- Wow.

1015
01:06:58,723 --> 01:07:00,849
- So, you ready for tonight?
- Yeah.

1016
01:07:02,018 --> 01:07:03,227
I'm glad to see you.

1017
01:07:06,272 --> 01:07:08,774
- Are you excited?
- Yeah.

1018
01:07:09,901 --> 01:07:11,026
- Louder!
- Yeah!

1019
01:07:11,194 --> 01:07:13,529
- Yeah!
- So excited!

1020
01:07:15,907 --> 01:07:19,118
- Here's our itinerary.
- You made me an itinerary?

1021
01:07:19,285 --> 01:07:22,121
Yeah, we got a lot to do.
We got to make up for lost time.

1022
01:07:23,415 --> 01:07:25,040
Google Maps. Nice.

1023
01:07:25,834 --> 01:07:28,627
OK, full disclosure:

1024
01:07:28,795 --> 01:07:30,963
I have played before,

1025
01:07:31,131 --> 01:07:33,382
and I might be kind of good.

1026
01:07:33,550 --> 01:07:35,050
- This is pretty.
- It is pretty.

1027
01:07:35,218 --> 01:07:37,720
- But this... it's just gonna be fun.
- OK.

1028
01:07:38,263 --> 01:07:39,471
Ladies first.

1029
01:07:40,223 --> 01:07:43,976
OK. Don't expect too much.

1030
01:07:48,148 --> 01:07:49,481
Nice and easy.

1031
01:07:57,824 --> 01:08:01,410
- Yeah. I stuck it in.
- Wow.

1032
01:08:01,578 --> 01:08:03,829
Well, this hole's
a little bit more complicated.

1033
01:08:03,997 --> 01:08:07,624
You're gonna have to bank it off there.
It's all about the geometry.

1034
01:08:07,792 --> 01:08:09,168
I'm a doctor.

1035
01:08:22,807 --> 01:08:24,558
That hole is my bitch!

1036
01:08:38,823 --> 01:08:41,533
Yes! Yes!

1037
01:08:41,701 --> 01:08:43,285
Yeah!

1038
01:08:44,996 --> 01:08:46,163
Thank you.

1039
01:08:46,831 --> 01:08:48,791
I don't get my own milkshake?

1040
01:08:48,958 --> 01:08:52,878
No, it's one milkshake, two straws.
That's what makes it special.

1041
01:08:53,046 --> 01:08:54,838
But I'm so hungry.

1042
01:08:55,006 --> 01:08:57,716
We have dinner later.
Didn't you read the itinerary?

1043
01:08:57,884 --> 01:09:00,552
You're gonna get more shake,
you have a bigger mouth.

1044
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:03,514
You have a pretty big mouth.
Oh, easy.

1045
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:10,938
Hey! That's cheating.

1046
01:09:18,404 --> 01:09:19,696
Sorry.

1047
01:09:21,115 --> 01:09:22,366
Thanks.

1048
01:09:23,451 --> 01:09:26,745
I really like you.

1049
01:09:27,413 --> 01:09:29,122
I actually think that...

1050
01:09:32,961 --> 01:09:34,545
...I'm falling...

1051
01:09:39,926 --> 01:09:41,552
You can have the rest.

1052
01:10:09,289 --> 01:10:11,623
How do they change these lightbulbs?

1053
01:10:11,791 --> 01:10:13,375
Must be a nightmare.

1054
01:10:13,543 --> 01:10:17,379
- Adam?
- Oh, here. You want your coat?

1055
01:10:17,547 --> 01:10:19,214
- I can take that.
- You cold?

1056
01:10:23,052 --> 01:10:26,471
I can't do this. Could you please
take me back to work?

1057
01:10:26,639 --> 01:10:29,182
No. No, that's not the deal.

1058
01:10:29,350 --> 01:10:31,977
The deal is
that we're gonna walk around,

1059
01:10:32,145 --> 01:10:34,521
and we're gonna look
at the twinkly lights, and then...

1060
01:10:34,689 --> 01:10:36,690
Why are you messing
everything up?

1061
01:10:37,442 --> 01:10:39,818
That's what people do, Emma.

1062
01:10:39,986 --> 01:10:41,987
They buy each other flowers,
and they go to museums...

1063
01:10:42,155 --> 01:10:45,282
You know me.
This stuff freaks me out.

1064
01:10:45,450 --> 01:10:46,909
It's fake.

1065
01:10:48,494 --> 01:10:51,830
What's wrong with what we're doing?
It's working. We don't have to fight...

1066
01:10:51,998 --> 01:10:54,333
- Maybe I want to fight.
- Yeah, well, I don't.

1067
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:57,544
What are you gonna do?
You're never gonna feel anything?

1068
01:10:57,712 --> 01:10:59,129
How you gonna do that?

1069
01:10:59,297 --> 01:11:01,840
I don't know. I'll figure it out.

1070
01:11:05,595 --> 01:11:07,930
- You're so messed up.
- Yeah?

1071
01:11:08,097 --> 01:11:12,643
I don't need you to take care of me.
I take care of myself.

1072
01:11:13,353 --> 01:11:15,520
That's what I do.

1073
01:11:15,688 --> 01:11:20,567
Why don't you go find some other girl
who's not gonna hurt you?

1074
01:11:22,737 --> 01:11:25,072
Because I love you.

1075
01:11:25,239 --> 01:11:27,532
It's obvious.
I completely love you. There.

1076
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:29,534
Oh, yeah. You're such a wimp.

1077
01:11:29,702 --> 01:11:31,578
- I am not a wimp.
- Well, then be with me!

1078
01:11:32,288 --> 01:11:34,831
OK, you're gonna fight me.
Yeah? Is that what you're gonna?

1079
01:11:34,999 --> 01:11:39,461
You can't fight me, you're miniature.
You're like a girl Rick Moranis.

1080
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:42,547
You fight like a hamster.

1081
01:11:42,715 --> 01:11:45,050
Hey. Hey!

1082
01:11:45,218 --> 01:11:49,554
Excuse me! Excuse me!
You can't do that here.

1083
01:11:49,722 --> 01:11:52,516
OK. I'm sorry.

1084
01:12:00,316 --> 01:12:01,817
All right, you're out!

1085
01:12:18,626 --> 01:12:20,419
I can't keep doing this.

1086
01:12:25,591 --> 01:12:27,592
I'm not gonna see you again.

1087
01:12:29,095 --> 01:12:30,429
I know.

1088
01:12:31,514 --> 01:12:33,181
That makes sense.

1089
01:12:40,523 --> 01:12:42,399
Bye.

1090
01:13:12,930 --> 01:13:16,850
- Hey, you OK?
- Yeah. I'm fine, thanks.

1091
01:13:17,018 --> 01:13:21,063
- You wanna go get a coffee?
- No, thanks.

1092
01:13:36,579 --> 01:13:38,497
You're a really good cook.

1093
01:13:38,664 --> 01:13:40,248
Oh, this? I just threw it together.

1094
01:13:41,751 --> 01:13:42,918
Oh, shit.

1095
01:13:43,836 --> 01:13:44,836
Oh, hey, Adam!

1096
01:13:47,006 --> 01:13:49,216
Adam. Hello!

1097
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:51,968
Lucy.

1098
01:13:52,136 --> 01:13:53,720
Yeah, we were just having
a romantic night

1099
01:13:53,888 --> 01:13:55,889
when your friend
stopped by from work.

1100
01:13:56,057 --> 01:13:57,808
Usually I spend Valentine's Day
catching up on work and stuff,

1101
01:13:57,975 --> 01:14:00,393
but this is like, this is really fun.

1102
01:14:01,437 --> 01:14:02,854
How was your night?

1103
01:14:03,856 --> 01:14:05,273
Yeah, it wasn't.

1104
01:14:10,029 --> 01:14:11,738
Do you want to go to my room?

1105
01:14:11,906 --> 01:14:14,032
Yes, I do. Perfect.

1106
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:16,409
Sorry, gotta go. So sorry.

1107
01:14:16,577 --> 01:14:19,371
Oh, you know what? I need a napkin.
Can I just borrow this one?

1108
01:14:19,539 --> 01:14:23,500
Sorry. Just... quick.
Thank you. Beautiful.

1109
01:14:23,668 --> 01:14:25,585
So, I'm really excited to talk to you.

1110
01:14:25,753 --> 01:14:29,548
I hope it's OK
that I got your address from the W-4.

1111
01:14:29,715 --> 01:14:31,925
- Is that weird? OK.
- No.

1112
01:14:34,804 --> 01:14:37,639
Oh, wow. This is cool.
This is a cool space.

1113
01:14:37,807 --> 01:14:39,015
- Thanks.
- Cozy.

1114
01:14:39,183 --> 01:14:41,685
I didn't know that...
I'm sorry about everything.

1115
01:14:41,853 --> 01:14:44,020
What? Oh, my God.
You're sorry? Are you crazy?

1116
01:14:44,188 --> 01:14:47,566
No, I'm sorry. I'm the one
who's come to your house uninvited.

1117
01:14:47,733 --> 01:14:50,527
So unprofessional.
But I read your script.

1118
01:14:51,237 --> 01:14:54,239
- And I love it. I really do.
- Really?

1119
01:14:54,407 --> 01:14:56,241
Yeah, and honestly, like, I didn't think
that you could write,

1120
01:14:56,409 --> 01:14:58,910
mainly 'cause you're just...
so beautiful.

1121
01:14:59,078 --> 01:15:03,790
- Seriously, it's distracting for me.
- Thank you. For reading it.

1122
01:15:03,958 --> 01:15:05,083
Yeah.

1123
01:15:05,251 --> 01:15:07,752
I mean, it's just teenagers
singing about homework.

1124
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:09,921
Yeah, yeah, but no, I read it
and I was like,

1125
01:15:10,089 --> 01:15:12,799
"God, I want to, like, drive over there
and tell him in person."

1126
01:15:12,967 --> 01:15:14,676
So I did. I got in my car,
and here I am.

1127
01:15:14,844 --> 01:15:17,429
You know, it's just...
I know, it sounds crazy,

1128
01:15:17,597 --> 01:15:19,264
'cause now that I'm saying it out loud,
it does sound crazy.

1129
01:15:19,432 --> 01:15:22,267
It's not crazy.
I mean, thank you for reading it.

1130
01:15:22,435 --> 01:15:24,311
No, no, no.
I e-mailed it to Megan, and...

1131
01:15:24,478 --> 01:15:25,729
- No shit?
- Yeah.

1132
01:15:25,897 --> 01:15:28,815
- And we'll see what she says.
- Wow.

1133
01:15:28,983 --> 01:15:30,442
Yeah, I told her she'd be crazy
to not like it.

1134
01:15:30,610 --> 01:15:33,778
But then again, she is a functioning
psychotic, so it's like, who knows?

1135
01:15:33,946 --> 01:15:36,364
But there is this extra episode
right before the break.

1136
01:15:36,532 --> 01:15:37,908
And they are gonna hire
a freelancer, so...

1137
01:15:38,075 --> 01:15:40,410
I feel like I'm talking
too much about this, but...

1138
01:15:40,578 --> 01:15:42,454
- Hey, do you wanna?
- What?

1139
01:15:42,622 --> 01:15:44,080
Yeah, sorry. What were you gonna?

1140
01:15:45,541 --> 01:15:46,917
Just to hang out.

1141
01:15:48,002 --> 01:15:50,503
Oh. That's crazy.
I was like, "What's he gonna say?"

1142
01:15:50,671 --> 01:15:53,298
And then you said that. It's not
what I thought you were gonna say.

1143
01:15:57,303 --> 01:15:59,387
That is a chair.

1144
01:16:02,099 --> 01:16:03,475
Fuck, yeah.

1145
01:16:04,685 --> 01:16:06,061
Do I curse too much?

1146
01:16:06,854 --> 01:16:08,480
Fuck, no.

1147
01:16:24,288 --> 01:16:27,874
Dr. Anseed, three-two-five-one.
Dr. Anseed...

1148
01:16:28,042 --> 01:16:29,793
- Hey.
...three-two-five-one.

1149
01:16:32,838 --> 01:16:34,506
Can I say something?

1150
01:16:34,674 --> 01:16:36,424
And don't take this the wrong way,

1151
01:16:36,592 --> 01:16:38,718
because you know I'll be
your friend, no matter what.

1152
01:16:38,886 --> 01:16:41,846
It's just, you've been kind of
depressing to be around lately,

1153
01:16:42,014 --> 01:16:46,309
and I might start avoiding you
in the hallway, that's all.

1154
01:16:46,477 --> 01:16:48,311
Just thought you should know.

1155
01:16:52,858 --> 01:16:54,567
So, we won't be there
for the rehearsal dinner,

1156
01:16:54,735 --> 01:16:57,153
but we'll definitely be there
for the wedding on Saturday.

1157
01:16:57,321 --> 01:16:58,446
Well, what are you doing tonight?

1158
01:16:58,614 --> 01:17:02,659
Adam's episode is taping tonight,
so Eli wanted to go.

1159
01:17:02,827 --> 01:17:05,912
- I don't have to go.
- No. No, go. Have fun, really.

1160
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:07,497
Doctors.

1161
01:17:10,501 --> 01:17:11,459
So?

1162
01:17:11,627 --> 01:17:13,420
Don't worry about it.
I'll see you Saturday.

1163
01:17:27,184 --> 01:17:29,894
- He's an amazing lover.
- Oh, boy.

1164
01:17:30,730 --> 01:17:32,230
That's...

1165
01:17:32,398 --> 01:17:34,316
...why they call him Bones.

1166
01:17:38,988 --> 01:17:40,739
You know, I worry about you sometimes.

1167
01:17:41,282 --> 01:17:43,950
Why? Is this about me
not having a date?

1168
01:17:44,118 --> 01:17:48,955
No, no. I know you can dance alone,
and I know that you'll be fine.

1169
01:17:49,123 --> 01:17:51,333
You're always fine.

1170
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:54,919
- So?
- I don't know.

1171
01:17:57,048 --> 01:18:00,216
When we lost your father,
I couldn't stand to see you in pain,

1172
01:18:00,384 --> 01:18:04,596
and... I think you knew that.

1173
01:18:05,890 --> 01:18:10,226
And I think that... you got good
at being strong for me.

1174
01:18:12,980 --> 01:18:15,607
But I'm telling you, be hurt.

1175
01:18:15,775 --> 01:18:17,734
I can take it.

1176
01:18:20,821 --> 01:18:22,781
The world can take it.

1177
01:18:27,828 --> 01:18:28,953
OK.

1178
01:18:32,166 --> 01:18:33,875
Very pretty here.

1179
01:19:49,702 --> 01:19:51,911
So come by the bar. Great place.

1180
01:19:52,079 --> 01:19:53,997
Bring your friends.
I will take care of you.

1181
01:19:54,165 --> 01:19:56,583
Here's my business card.
I'm the owner. Me.

1182
01:19:56,750 --> 01:19:58,543
- So make sure you come by.
- Yeah.

1183
01:19:58,711 --> 01:20:01,212
All right? Hey. Great job.

1184
01:20:01,380 --> 01:20:03,089
- Yeah, great job, man.
- Really good, yeah.

1185
01:20:03,257 --> 01:20:06,050
- You guys liked it? Like really?
- Yeah.

1186
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:08,928
- But Wallace cried.
- So?

1187
01:20:09,096 --> 01:20:11,139
It reminded me of my senior prom.

1188
01:20:11,307 --> 01:20:14,225
I got a hand job on the dance floor
to "Who Let The Dogs Out."

1189
01:20:15,603 --> 01:20:18,813
Hey. Sorry.
OK, so there's good news, bad news.

1190
01:20:18,981 --> 01:20:21,316
The bad news is,
Megan is remarkably drunk.

1191
01:20:21,484 --> 01:20:23,401
Seriously, she was, like,
trying to take her shirt off.

1192
01:20:23,569 --> 01:20:26,029
But the good news is,
she wants to put you on staff.

1193
01:20:26,906 --> 01:20:28,239
- Really?
- So... Yeah.

1194
01:20:28,407 --> 01:20:30,158
- That's amazing.
- Yeah, so she... Yeah.

1195
01:20:30,326 --> 01:20:32,285
- Thank you.
- So, you're a paid writer.

1196
01:20:32,453 --> 01:20:34,287
Yeah.

1197
01:20:34,455 --> 01:20:37,332
Oh, my God. She's getting on
the buffet table? That makes...

1198
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:38,958
Wow.

1199
01:20:39,126 --> 01:20:40,752
Why are you not trying
to fuck that girl?

1200
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:41,961
Yeah.

1201
01:20:42,129 --> 01:20:45,548
Yeah, she's crazy hot, Adam.
She's like a sexy scientist.

1202
01:20:45,716 --> 01:20:48,635
You need to go over there,
man up, you need to go for it.

1203
01:20:48,802 --> 01:20:51,054
We're counting on you here, man.
Man up, man!

1204
01:20:51,222 --> 01:20:54,432
- Go for it! Man up!
- You keep saying "Man up."

1205
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:56,976
- You cried during the show.
- I liked the show.

1206
01:20:59,939 --> 01:21:01,314
Yeah.

1207
01:21:01,482 --> 01:21:03,608
- It was very good.
- It was OK.

1208
01:21:03,776 --> 01:21:05,902
You know, I have to...
One minute.

1209
01:21:10,241 --> 01:21:11,824
Katie?

1210
01:21:11,992 --> 01:21:14,452
The bridesmaids had pot.

1211
01:21:14,620 --> 01:21:16,788
Oh, my God, I'm so hungry.

1212
01:21:17,748 --> 01:21:19,958
Are you OK?

1213
01:21:20,125 --> 01:21:24,295
I'm fine, I just...
You know, I just...

1214
01:21:24,463 --> 01:21:26,631
Oh, God, I just love Kevin.

1215
01:21:26,799 --> 01:21:29,509
I just love Kevin so much, you know?

1216
01:21:29,677 --> 01:21:33,471
- I know you think it's stupid.
- No. No, I don't.

1217
01:21:33,639 --> 01:21:35,765
- You don't?
- No.

1218
01:21:40,813 --> 01:21:42,397
I can't stop thinking about him.

1219
01:21:42,565 --> 01:21:45,858
Who? Adam?

1220
01:21:48,696 --> 01:21:52,657
Yeah. I know it's over,
and I'm looking.

1221
01:21:52,825 --> 01:21:56,202
It's just no one is as...

1222
01:21:56,370 --> 01:21:58,454
- Tall?
- He's so tall.

1223
01:21:58,622 --> 01:22:01,207
- So tall...
- And he's so, like...

1224
01:22:01,375 --> 01:22:04,961
- Happy?
- Annoyingly happy, all the time.

1225
01:22:06,005 --> 01:22:09,507
But he has this...

1226
01:22:11,135 --> 01:22:13,052
He has the best heart.

1227
01:22:17,516 --> 01:22:19,559
- Call him.
- What? No.

1228
01:22:19,727 --> 01:22:21,019
I can't just call him.

1229
01:22:21,186 --> 01:22:23,146
I'm too stoned.
Don't argue with me.

1230
01:22:23,314 --> 01:22:24,689
He doesn't want me to call him.

1231
01:22:24,857 --> 01:22:26,608
I'm the bride.
You have to do what I say.

1232
01:22:26,775 --> 01:22:29,110
- We haven't talked in months.
- I'm the bride, it's my day.

1233
01:22:29,278 --> 01:22:30,695
It's my day!

1234
01:22:31,989 --> 01:22:33,489
Hey, Adam!

1235
01:22:34,116 --> 01:22:35,408
Oh, God.

1236
01:22:35,993 --> 01:22:38,453
You're so dope.
Did you know that about yourself?

1237
01:22:38,621 --> 01:22:40,288
Mama needs to get a cab home, so...

1238
01:22:40,456 --> 01:22:42,540
- Yeah.
- Shoot, I left my phone in my office...

1239
01:22:42,708 --> 01:22:44,167
I got it, I got it. Hang on. Here.

1240
01:22:44,335 --> 01:22:45,793
- Do you want to call and just?
- Yeah.

1241
01:22:45,961 --> 01:22:47,795
What are you doing?

1242
01:22:47,963 --> 01:22:51,466
Chuck! Chuck!
Will you please fuck off? Please?

1243
01:22:51,634 --> 01:22:53,134
- I don't want to go.
- Yeah, all right.

1244
01:22:53,302 --> 01:22:55,053
I don't want to go home.

1245
01:22:55,638 --> 01:22:57,639
- I don't want to go home.
- Who is it?

1246
01:22:58,724 --> 01:23:02,226
"Do Not Call Her" is calling.
Do you want to take it?

1247
01:23:03,729 --> 01:23:04,937
I want your face.

1248
01:23:17,201 --> 01:23:18,242
Hello?

1249
01:23:18,410 --> 01:23:20,620
Hi.

1250
01:23:20,788 --> 01:23:23,748
It's Emma. Kurtzman.

1251
01:23:23,916 --> 01:23:25,917
From Camp Weehawken.

1252
01:23:29,171 --> 01:23:33,257
Yes... What is it?

1253
01:23:34,093 --> 01:23:38,846
So, my sister is getting married
in Santa Barbara tomorrow, and...

1254
01:23:40,224 --> 01:23:43,434
I don't know. I heard your show is
tonight. Congratulations.

1255
01:23:43,602 --> 01:23:45,603
Thank you.

1256
01:23:47,773 --> 01:23:51,275
I know this is random. I just...

1257
01:23:52,194 --> 01:23:55,613
I miss you. I miss you so much.

1258
01:23:56,740 --> 01:23:57,990
OK.

1259
01:23:59,993 --> 01:24:01,828
I don't know what to say.

1260
01:24:02,496 --> 01:24:05,623
You're... You're calling me because
you're at your sister's wedding,

1261
01:24:05,791 --> 01:24:07,458
and she looks happy, and...

1262
01:24:07,626 --> 01:24:11,462
...everyone is happy,
and you're not.

1263
01:24:13,090 --> 01:24:17,510
I thought...
I don't know what I thought. I just...

1264
01:24:17,678 --> 01:24:20,972
I... I guess I wanted to hear
your voice.

1265
01:24:22,141 --> 01:24:24,892
- I mean, I know we broke up, but...
- Emma.

1266
01:24:26,145 --> 01:24:30,148
We didn't break up.
We never started.

1267
01:24:32,276 --> 01:24:34,861
I gotta go. I'm still at work, so...

1268
01:24:36,155 --> 01:24:40,533
Have fun at the wedding,
and tell your sister congratulations.

1269
01:24:41,660 --> 01:24:42,869
Bye.

1270
01:24:51,670 --> 01:24:54,130
Oh, fuck.

1271
01:25:02,181 --> 01:25:03,181
I have to...

1272
01:25:03,348 --> 01:25:05,808
- Go.
- Now.

1273
01:25:10,981 --> 01:25:14,233
- Hey. Can I?
- Hey. Of course.

1274
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:16,861
Is everything OK? Are you?

1275
01:25:17,029 --> 01:25:18,571
Yeah.

1276
01:25:18,739 --> 01:25:21,532
- Yeah. Yes.
- Yeah. Good.

1277
01:25:21,700 --> 01:25:24,243
- This is amazing.
- Yeah.

1278
01:25:24,411 --> 01:25:26,078
Thank you for this. This...

1279
01:25:26,246 --> 01:25:28,581
- What?
- This was all you.

1280
01:25:28,749 --> 01:25:32,043
- What? No, I mean...
- No, I'm not here without you.

1281
01:25:32,211 --> 01:25:35,838
That's... That's not true.
It's all you.

1282
01:25:36,006 --> 01:25:37,465
It's all you. This was all you.

1283
01:25:39,802 --> 01:25:42,678
Hey, wait! If you don't make it back
for my wedding, I'll kill you.

1284
01:25:42,846 --> 01:25:44,514
Bye. Drive safe.

1285
01:26:40,821 --> 01:26:43,281
No, but that was you,
and it felt poignant

1286
01:26:43,448 --> 01:26:44,782
that, of course,
the song was "It Was You."

1287
01:26:44,950 --> 01:26:47,743
- When Benji and Sari did the kiss...
- They committed to it.

1288
01:26:47,911 --> 01:26:50,580
That's what hit. Do you think
they could remix the song?

1289
01:26:50,747 --> 01:26:53,916
How drunk was Megan?
She tried to hump my leg.

1290
01:26:54,084 --> 01:26:55,793
You have no idea,
the stories that I could tell you.

1291
01:26:55,961 --> 01:26:59,297
- No, she really tried to like mount it.
- Yeah, I know.

1292
01:27:02,301 --> 01:27:03,926
Yeah, I got it.

1293
01:27:06,430 --> 01:27:08,139
Ornery thing.

1294
01:27:26,158 --> 01:27:28,993
Hey. How'd it go?
Did you find him?

1295
01:27:29,828 --> 01:27:34,040
Yeah. He was with... with a girl.
It was his girlfriend.

1296
01:27:35,042 --> 01:27:37,376
And I was in a bush.

1297
01:27:37,544 --> 01:27:39,003
- Oh.
- Yeah.

1298
01:27:39,171 --> 01:27:40,671
Crap.

1299
01:27:43,008 --> 01:27:45,468
- Are you still there?
- Yeah.

1300
01:27:45,636 --> 01:27:47,511
OK, get in your car and drive away.

1301
01:27:47,679 --> 01:27:49,639
And how much money
do you have on you?

1302
01:27:52,643 --> 01:27:54,477
Like ten bucks.

1303
01:27:54,645 --> 01:27:57,563
OK. The box of 50
doughnut holes is $5.79.

1304
01:27:58,732 --> 01:28:01,067
You're gonna need two boxes.

1305
01:28:01,234 --> 01:28:02,693
I lost him.

1306
01:28:02,861 --> 01:28:06,364
- I'm so sorry.
- Yeah.

1307
01:28:06,531 --> 01:28:09,992
- I love you.
- I know.

1308
01:28:12,871 --> 01:28:15,206
So, then when I was, like, 11,
I was in therapy

1309
01:28:15,374 --> 01:28:18,376
because I was, like, obsessively
biting my hair,

1310
01:28:18,543 --> 01:28:21,212
and then three months in,
my therapist died.

1311
01:28:21,380 --> 01:28:22,964
- I know, so that was kind of a bummer.
- Whoa.

1312
01:28:23,131 --> 01:28:26,050
But, yeah.
That's why I hate planes.

1313
01:28:27,552 --> 01:28:28,594
Thanks.

1314
01:28:28,762 --> 01:28:30,596
- So, that's that story.
- Cheers.

1315
01:28:30,764 --> 01:28:32,264
Thank you.

1316
01:28:39,231 --> 01:28:40,272
- I'm so sorry.
- No...

1317
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:42,400
- That was such a fail on my part.
- It's OK...

1318
01:28:42,567 --> 01:28:43,901
- Wait, let me...
- It's fine.

1319
01:28:44,695 --> 01:28:46,070
We can... I can do better than that.

1320
01:28:46,238 --> 01:28:48,280
- Can we try again?
- Sure. Mulligan.

1321
01:28:48,448 --> 01:28:50,157
- Let's... Why don't we?
- OK.

1322
01:28:50,325 --> 01:28:51,701
All right.

1323
01:28:58,250 --> 01:29:01,210
Oh, my God. This is happening.
Is this really happening?

1324
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:04,338
Oh, my God. You're touching me.
This is so happening.

1325
01:29:04,506 --> 01:29:06,757
Maybe we don't need to talk
about everything.

1326
01:29:06,925 --> 01:29:10,594
Oh. OK, great. OK. Cool.

1327
01:29:12,806 --> 01:29:14,974
Wait. Are you sure
that you want to do this, though?

1328
01:29:16,435 --> 01:29:18,436
Yes. Yeah.

1329
01:29:18,603 --> 01:29:20,563
OK, 'cause, like, we can just
talk about it, if you want...

1330
01:29:20,731 --> 01:29:24,108
- Let's not talk about it.
- Oh, OK. OK.

1331
01:29:24,276 --> 01:29:26,527
Wait. Should I take my shirt off,
or do you want to...

1332
01:29:26,695 --> 01:29:28,404
Do you want to take it off yourself?

1333
01:29:28,572 --> 01:29:31,532
- I'll take it off.
- You know what? I'll take it off.

1334
01:29:31,700 --> 01:29:33,075
OK.

1335
01:29:36,788 --> 01:29:38,706
Glad I wore a good bra.

1336
01:29:40,625 --> 01:29:43,210
Is that your phone? Do you wanna?

1337
01:29:44,171 --> 01:29:45,212
We'll just ignore it.

1338
01:29:45,380 --> 01:29:47,423
You can just get it.

1339
01:29:48,258 --> 01:29:50,134
No, it's fine.

1340
01:29:52,137 --> 01:29:55,473
- Is it "Do Not Call Her"?
- No.

1341
01:29:56,266 --> 01:29:57,475
I don't know.

1342
01:29:59,311 --> 01:30:01,353
Wait. I'll just...

1343
01:30:01,521 --> 01:30:02,813
- OK.
- I'll just shut it off.

1344
01:30:02,981 --> 01:30:06,067
Yeah, just...
That'll be easier, switch...

1345
01:30:09,654 --> 01:30:12,156
- Sorry.
- Yeah.

1346
01:30:12,324 --> 01:30:13,908
Vanessa?

1347
01:30:18,830 --> 01:30:21,665
- I'm coming.
- You're what?

1348
01:30:25,128 --> 01:30:28,047
It's my dad. There's an emergency.
He's in the hospital.

1349
01:30:28,215 --> 01:30:31,175
Oh, my God.
OK. Do you want me to go with you?

1350
01:30:31,343 --> 01:30:34,887
- No, I'm OK.
- OK.

1351
01:30:35,055 --> 01:30:37,181
- Can I call you later?
- Yeah. No, I'll get a cab.

1352
01:30:37,349 --> 01:30:39,934
I'll, like, find my way home.
Go. Yeah.

1353
01:30:54,282 --> 01:30:57,201
Keep, keep bleedin' love

1354
01:30:57,369 --> 01:31:01,622
Keep bleedin'
I keep, keep bleedin'

1355
01:31:16,221 --> 01:31:18,430
Hey. Where is he?
What happened?

1356
01:31:18,598 --> 01:31:20,057
OK.

1357
01:31:20,225 --> 01:31:22,226
Don't freak out, OK?

1358
01:31:23,562 --> 01:31:25,396
Your dad overdosed on cough syrup.

1359
01:31:26,106 --> 01:31:28,816
- He what?
- The Purple Drank.

1360
01:31:29,609 --> 01:31:31,402
"The Purple Drank"?

1361
01:31:31,570 --> 01:31:35,406
It's Seven-Up, cough syrup
and a Jolly Rancher.

1362
01:31:36,700 --> 01:31:39,201
Why would he do that, Vanessa?

1363
01:31:39,369 --> 01:31:41,453
Because he loves Lil Wayne, OK?

1364
01:31:41,621 --> 01:31:43,581
You don't know everything
about your dad.

1365
01:31:43,748 --> 01:31:47,293
Why are you making him
listen to Lil Wayne?

1366
01:31:47,878 --> 01:31:51,547
- You should be taking care of him.
- I can't do this. I can't do it.

1367
01:31:51,715 --> 01:31:54,466
You know, I didn't think
that it was gonna be so...

1368
01:31:55,886 --> 01:31:59,263
I don't want to have kids.
I... I just... I want to have fun.

1369
01:32:02,017 --> 01:32:06,478
- He's so old.
- Yeah. He's getting older.

1370
01:32:07,230 --> 01:32:09,440
And you're gonna have to deal with that.

1371
01:32:10,942 --> 01:32:14,695
Adam...
old people scare me.

1372
01:32:17,240 --> 01:32:19,408
Let's just go see him, OK?

1373
01:32:19,576 --> 01:32:22,536
No, no, no. I can't. I can't.
Adam, I can't. I've gotta go.

1374
01:32:22,704 --> 01:32:26,540
My friend, she's having a party.
I'm already so late.

1375
01:32:28,168 --> 01:32:30,002
Will you just take Freckles?

1376
01:32:34,966 --> 01:32:39,511
Don't take this the wrong way,
but you're a terrible person.

1377
01:32:39,679 --> 01:32:41,805
Just take Freckles.

1378
01:33:12,379 --> 01:33:13,837
Hey, Dad.

1379
01:33:16,758 --> 01:33:18,300
Hey, kiddo.

1380
01:33:20,303 --> 01:33:24,265
- I had a bad trip on The Drank.
- Yeah, I heard.

1381
01:33:28,019 --> 01:33:31,021
If anybody asks,
this is a Seeing Eye dog.

1382
01:33:34,526 --> 01:33:37,152
- Where's?
- She went home.

1383
01:33:38,154 --> 01:33:39,280
Right.

1384
01:33:41,741 --> 01:33:45,286
I really don't like the Little Wayne.
Can't understand what he's saying.

1385
01:33:47,247 --> 01:33:49,873
You know who I wish
was here right now?

1386
01:33:50,041 --> 01:33:51,583
Your mom.

1387
01:33:52,419 --> 01:33:55,546
Yeah. Well, you left her, so...

1388
01:33:58,008 --> 01:33:59,300
Why?

1389
01:34:00,385 --> 01:34:03,679
When you're married
and you do blow...

1390
01:34:04,806 --> 01:34:07,891
...try to stay away from women
who want to fuck you.

1391
01:34:08,059 --> 01:34:09,643
Even ugly women.

1392
01:34:09,811 --> 01:34:13,272
Blow is blind, Adam.
Blow is blind.

1393
01:34:14,274 --> 01:34:15,774
You're an asshole.

1394
01:34:16,651 --> 01:34:18,152
But you're not.

1395
01:34:19,237 --> 01:34:24,366
You got a good heart, Adam.
Try to keep it.

1396
01:34:24,534 --> 01:34:27,828
Where's that girl, Emma?
You guys still together?

1397
01:34:29,414 --> 01:34:33,500
- We were never together.
- Oh, that's right. Friends...

1398
01:34:34,794 --> 01:34:37,671
Sex friends... I'm old.
I don't know what you call it.

1399
01:34:37,839 --> 01:34:39,006
You liked her.

1400
01:34:42,886 --> 01:34:45,012
She drives me crazy.

1401
01:34:49,768 --> 01:34:52,936
I'm 58 years old.
I've been married three times.

1402
01:34:53,104 --> 01:34:54,897
Twice.

1403
01:34:55,607 --> 01:34:56,940
OK.

1404
01:34:57,108 --> 01:35:01,278
I've got six pictures
of my cock on my phone,

1405
01:35:01,446 --> 01:35:03,113
and two of someone else's,

1406
01:35:03,281 --> 01:35:05,366
and I'm still pretty high
on the cough syrup,

1407
01:35:05,533 --> 01:35:07,910
so you can take this
with a grain of salt, but...

1408
01:35:08,078 --> 01:35:11,955
...we don't pick
who we fall in love with.

1409
01:35:12,123 --> 01:35:14,750
And it never happens like it should.

1410
01:35:17,754 --> 01:35:19,004
Yes.

1411
01:35:19,172 --> 01:35:24,760
I may have to kill this dog.
I just haven't decided how.

1412
01:35:29,516 --> 01:35:31,392
Get some sleep, Dad.

1413
01:35:33,645 --> 01:35:35,813
I'll call you in the morning.

1414
01:35:44,489 --> 01:35:46,615
He'll call in the morning.

1415
01:35:49,035 --> 01:35:50,619
Isn't that something?

1416
01:35:51,871 --> 01:35:53,497
Am I boring you?

1417
01:35:53,665 --> 01:35:55,207
Oh, good.

1418
01:36:10,515 --> 01:36:12,182
Adam!

1419
01:36:12,642 --> 01:36:17,688
Hey. You can't call me
and tell me that you miss me.

1420
01:36:17,856 --> 01:36:20,482
I don't want to have
that conversation on the phone.

1421
01:36:20,650 --> 01:36:24,027
So you can't text me
and you can't e-mail me,

1422
01:36:24,195 --> 01:36:27,865
and you can't... write on my wall.

1423
01:36:28,032 --> 01:36:30,868
Like, if you really miss me,
you need to grow up

1424
01:36:31,035 --> 01:36:34,288
and get in your car
and come and see me.

1425
01:36:35,081 --> 01:36:36,874
I'm here.

1426
01:36:44,799 --> 01:36:46,383
How did...
How did you know that?

1427
01:36:46,551 --> 01:36:50,387
Shira texted me about
your dad, so I came here.

1428
01:36:56,102 --> 01:36:57,102
You got...

1429
01:36:59,355 --> 01:37:00,522
How is your dad?

1430
01:37:02,066 --> 01:37:03,734
- He's OK.
- Good.

1431
01:37:05,987 --> 01:37:09,907
- I know I can't just call you.
- No. You can't.

1432
01:37:10,074 --> 01:37:13,952
I know.
I hurt you. I'm sorry.

1433
01:37:15,455 --> 01:37:19,500
I don't know why I wasted so much time
pretending I didn't care.

1434
01:37:19,667 --> 01:37:24,171
I guess I just didn't
want to feel like this.

1435
01:37:24,339 --> 01:37:25,672
It hurts.

1436
01:37:28,259 --> 01:37:30,761
But I love you. I'm totally
and completely in love with you,

1437
01:37:30,929 --> 01:37:34,306
and I don't care if you think it's
too late, I'm telling you anyway.

1438
01:37:40,438 --> 01:37:42,814
- Will you please say something?
- Wait.

1439
01:37:46,110 --> 01:37:47,528
You should know...

1440
01:37:50,323 --> 01:37:52,783
...if you come any closer,

1441
01:37:52,951 --> 01:37:55,452
I'm not letting you go.

1442
01:38:06,047 --> 01:38:09,633
- I love you.
- That's good.

1443
01:38:18,059 --> 01:38:20,227
You want to go with me
to this stupid thing?

1444
01:38:20,395 --> 01:38:23,814
Your sister's wedding thing?

1445
01:38:25,024 --> 01:38:27,150
How long do we have
till we have to be there?

1446
01:38:27,318 --> 01:38:29,695
A couple hours.

1447
01:38:30,613 --> 01:38:34,825
- What do you want to do?
- Something crazy.

1448
01:38:45,878 --> 01:38:47,879
Now I know why you never wanted
to have breakfast with me.

1449
01:38:48,047 --> 01:38:49,339
What?

1450
01:38:49,507 --> 01:38:53,510
You eat like a baby dinosaur.
You don't even chew.

1451
01:38:54,679 --> 01:38:57,180
Do you think you can get used to it?

1452
01:38:57,348 --> 01:38:58,348
Yeah, I think so.

1453
01:38:58,516 --> 01:39:01,351
Good. I was hoping
we could do this a lot more.

1454
01:39:01,519 --> 01:39:05,147
Really?
You know, I was thinking...

1455
01:39:05,315 --> 01:39:07,983
We're gonna have to come up
with some new rules.

1456
01:39:08,151 --> 01:39:11,028
I'd like to start calling you
"honey" and "babe."

1457
01:39:11,195 --> 01:39:14,281
- I don't know about "babe."
- No?

1458
01:39:15,617 --> 01:39:16,950
- Snuggling?
- Oh, yeah.

1459
01:39:17,118 --> 01:39:21,788
- I'm gonna hold your hand.
- Wow. This is all moving so fast.

1460
01:39:22,415 --> 01:39:26,043
Also, I'd like to leave
the door open when I pee.

1461
01:39:28,421 --> 01:39:29,713
I think no.

1462
01:39:29,881 --> 01:39:34,051
I think I'm gonna do it all the time.
It's gonna get weird.

1463
01:39:56,407 --> 01:39:58,742
- Thank God we're on time.
- Yeah.

1464
01:40:15,885 --> 01:40:17,594
So what happens now?

1465
01:40:46,916 --> 01:40:49,710
- Adam should be here any minute.
- Good, 'cause I'm starving.

1466
01:40:49,877 --> 01:40:54,256
So, you've told him about us.

1467
01:40:55,675 --> 01:40:57,634
- No, not yet.
- What?

1468
01:40:59,053 --> 01:41:00,929
I thought I'd wait till he got here.

1469
01:41:04,100 --> 01:41:06,935
- And that's a good idea?
- Yeah, it'll be fine.

1470
01:41:07,103 --> 01:41:09,312
So, to Burning Man?

1471
01:41:09,480 --> 01:41:11,982
- Was that fun, or what?
- So fun.

1472
01:41:12,400 --> 01:41:14,067
Dad!

1473
01:41:14,235 --> 01:41:15,819
Eli!

1474
01:41:15,987 --> 01:41:17,237
This is her! This is Patrice!

1475
01:41:17,405 --> 01:41:20,323
Hi, it's so nice to see you again.

1476
01:41:20,491 --> 01:41:24,786
- We love you already!
- Come on, family hug!

1477
01:42:15,588 --> 01:42:19,132
Shira, I feel like there are parts of me
that I haven't explored yet.

1478
01:42:19,300 --> 01:42:22,344
And I'm feeling like
I want to see other people.

1479
01:42:22,512 --> 01:42:25,138
Oh, I thought...
This is embarrassing.

1480
01:42:25,306 --> 01:42:28,183
I have been seeing other people, Sam.

1481
01:42:28,351 --> 01:42:30,685
- You have?
- Yeah, a lot of other people.

1482
01:42:30,853 --> 01:42:32,270
How many?

1483
01:42:32,438 --> 01:42:34,189
I don't know, man. I mean,

1484
01:42:34,357 --> 01:42:36,566
two that I can think of
off the top of my head, but...

1485
01:42:36,734 --> 01:42:39,069
- You remember when I went to Cabo?
- Yeah.

1486
01:42:39,237 --> 01:42:42,197
- I was a very bad girl on that trip.
- You're kidding me?

1487
01:42:42,365 --> 01:42:43,782
You're doing great.

1488
01:42:43,950 --> 01:42:45,659
Keep pushing.

1489
01:42:45,827 --> 01:42:46,827
Oh, God.

1490
01:42:46,994 --> 01:42:49,329
I've got the ice chips, honey.
Here you go.

1491
01:42:49,497 --> 01:42:51,998
Oh, I hate you, you dumb fuck!
Get the fuck out...

1492
01:42:52,166 --> 01:42:55,001
- You eat the fucking ice chips!
- I love you so much.

1493
01:42:56,963 --> 01:42:59,214
Come on. It's OK.
