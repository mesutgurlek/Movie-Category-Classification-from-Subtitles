The shape of the pelvic bones
rules out childbirth as the cause...

00:57:30,864 --> 00:57:34,027
It's kind of a long story.
Or not that long of a story.

783
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:37,692
- Hey. Am I interrupting?
- No, not at all.

784
00:57:37,871 --> 00:57:40,362
- Great. Can we take this chair? Thanks.
- Sure.

785

Sit down.

786

Do you know Julia? Lan.

787
00:57:44,244 --> 00:57:46,303
Yeah, we've met once or twice.

788
00:57:46,479 --> 00:57:48,674

just like mine.

- RADA?

790
00:57:52,051 --> 00:57:54,645
Royal Academy of Dramatic Art,
it's in London.

791
00:57:54,821 --> 00:57:55,981
Oh.

792
00:57:56,156 --> 00:57:58,920
- Did you hear about Patrick O'Houlihan?
- Lucky bastard.

793

I'm hoping to catch the show
when I go to New York.

We should get a whole group of
people together and surprise him.

795

Sounds fun.

796

- Jam, on your lip.
- Oh.

797
00:58:11,804 --> 00:58:15,103
You know, we really should order.
We've got a rehearsal to get back to.

798

BRIDGET:
Hello?

801
00:58:25,418 --> 00:58:27,283
Excuse me, sir?

802
00:58:30,423 --> 00:58:32,721
Hi. Greta?

803
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:36,194
Um, I'm really sorry.

804
00:58:36,362 --> 00:58:39,593
I should have called first, but I'm...

805
00:58:39,766 --> 00:58:41,996
I think I know my own granddaughter.

806
00:58:45,071 --> 00:58:47,301
You're not running away from home,
are you?

807
00:58:50,410 --> 00:58:54,005
No, actually, I'm coming home,
from Turkey.

808
00:58:54,714 --> 00:58:57,114
That's an interesting sense of direction.

809
00:59:04,524 --> 00:59:06,754
So you fix your own car?

810
00:59:07,327 --> 00:59:12,230
Cars are easy.
It's people you need a manual for.

811
00:59:20,473 --> 00:59:23,499
Come on in. You must be exhausted.

812
00:59:23,676 --> 00:59:25,667
BRIDGET:
Yep. You don't even know.

813
00:59:25,845 --> 00:59:28,143
GRETA: Why don't you go right up
and get some rest?

814
00:59:31,451 --> 00:59:33,385
- Hello!
- Hey.

815
00:59:33,553 --> 00:59:35,487
Hey. Wow, you look great.

816
00:59:36,055 --> 00:59:37,386
You think? Thanks.

817
00:59:37,890 --> 00:59:39,221
So, what's the occasion?

818
00:59:39,392 --> 00:59:41,758
Um, lan asked me to dinner.

819
00:59:42,895 --> 00:59:45,056
I mean, I can be so dense sometimes.

820
00:59:45,231 --> 00:59:47,927
I didn't even know
that he liked me that way.

821
00:59:48,468 --> 00:59:50,698
- Did you?
- No.

822
00:59:51,437 --> 00:59:54,372
But, then again,
I can be pretty dense too so...

823
00:59:54,540 --> 00:59:56,974
I just thought he
might have said something to you...

824
00:59:57,143 --> 01:00:00,169
...because you guys have become
such good friends. You know men.

825
01:00:00,346 --> 01:00:03,179
So you're going, then?
You're going on a date?

826
01:00:03,349 --> 01:00:07,410
Yeah. I mean, he's gorgeous,
and he's really nice, and...

827
01:00:07,587 --> 01:00:10,954
...he's really real. For an actor, anyway.

828
01:00:11,958 --> 01:00:15,052
I just thought, why not give it a chance?

829
01:00:15,228 --> 01:00:19,028
We have so much in common anyway,
and it might really work.

830
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:22,868
I know you need sleep
before rehearsal tomorrow.

831

but don't wait up.

01:01:14,253 --> 01:01:16,619
...junior high and high school.

It's good. I haven't declared
a major yet, but...

Listen, you ought to kick up
some trouble now...

My grandfather, I think he could see
I did not love her.

...there never was a baby.

I wanted to tell you right away.

I had the right to ask your forgiveness.

- Forgive you?

I forgive you.

- That I'd be waiting for you to come here?

Well, you don't know that, Effie.

1243
01:34:08,256 --> 01:34:10,952
You don't treat someone
like that if you love them!

1244
01:34:11,126 --> 01:34:14,289
Well, it's not that simple.

1245
01:34:14,730 --> 01:34:17,130
You're actually taking
her side on this, aren't you?

1246
01:34:17,299 --> 01:34:19,062
No, I'm not taking sides.

Even though I'm your sister,
you've always chosen them over me.

Effie, that's not...

I wish I was on my way to Greece...

1250
01:34:26,375 --> 01:34:28,809
...so I could be out of this house
and away from you.

You know, you've barely said
two words to me all week.

I'm not good enough to be your friend?

Actually, I didn't read the reviews.
Were they any good?

That's not the point, Carmen.

1255

In case you forgot, I brought you here.

1256

So you wouldn't have any of this
if it weren't for me.

But you didn't really give me anything.

1258
01:35:12,687 --> 01:35:18,182
I am who I've always been, and, sure,
maybe for a minute, I was a little insecure.

I know you did what you could
to keep me that way.

from you.

But if there's one thing
I've learned this summer...

1264
01:35:37,245 --> 01:35:40,237
...it's that no one can diminish you
but yourself.

- What's wrong?

Took what?

1274
01:36:19,354 --> 01:36:20,582
The pants.

You took them? You have the pa...
You have them over there in Greece?

1276

That's the terrible part.

1277
01:36:29,664 --> 01:36:32,224
You see, I wore them on the ferry
and they got wet...

1278
01:36:32,400 --> 01:36:35,858
...so when I got to Yia Yia's,
I hung them on the clothesline.

blew them away or what, but they're gone.
