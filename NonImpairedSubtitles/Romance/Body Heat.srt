ANGELA:
My God, it's hot!

3
00:02:41,748 --> 00:02:45,168
l got out of the shower
and started sweating again.

4
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:47,754
Still burning?

5
00:02:48,087 --> 00:02:50,089
Jesus, it's bigger!

6
00:02:51,966 --> 00:02:53,051
What is it?

7
00:02:53,593 --> 00:02:57,305
NED: lt's the Seawater lnn.
My family used to eat there 25 years ago.

8
00:02:57,555 --> 00:03:00,183
Now somebody's torched it
to clear the lot.

ANGELA: lt's a shame.
NED: Probably one of my clients.

ANGELA:
l'm leaving.

11
00:03:08,399 --> 00:03:10,777
ANGELA: What do you care?
You're watching the fire.

12
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:12,320
You're done with me.

13
00:03:13,696 --> 00:03:15,490
You've had your fun.
You're spent.

14
00:03:16,241 --> 00:03:18,409
My history is burning up out there.

15
00:03:18,826 --> 00:03:21,162
l don't mind.
l'm leaving.

16
00:03:21,955 --> 00:03:24,916
l'm just getting into my uniform here.

17
00:03:27,043 --> 00:03:29,963
Why do they make these
damn skirts so hard to zip?

18
00:03:35,218 --> 00:03:38,137
NED: ''You're spent''?
Where did you hear that?

19
00:03:46,354 --> 00:03:49,899
Mr. Racine, l no longer care
whether these alleged toilets. . .

20
00:03:50,191 --> 00:03:52,610
. . .were ever actually en route
from lndiana.

21
00:03:52,861 --> 00:03:55,196
l think we're wasting our time here.

22
00:03:55,446 --> 00:03:59,200
lt's clear that your client
has attempted to defraud the county. . .

23
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:01,953
. . .in a not very ingenious manner.

24
00:04:02,203 --> 00:04:06,124
The assistant prosecutor has made
what l consider a generous offer.

25
00:04:06,374 --> 00:04:08,626
Given no semblance of a defense--

26
00:04:08,877 --> 00:04:11,671
Judge, perhaps when
l've presented all the evidence--

27
00:04:11,921 --> 00:04:13,631
Listen, if l were you. . .

28
00:04:13,882 --> 00:04:17,886
. . .l would recommend to your client
to do as Mr. Lowenstein suggests.

29
00:04:18,428 --> 00:04:21,139
Plead nolo contendere,
file chapter 1 1 . . .

30

. . .and agree to never do business
with Okeelanta County again.

31
00:04:26,603 --> 00:04:27,854
You'd agree?

32
00:04:28,104 --> 00:04:29,647
He could walk.

33
00:04:29,898 --> 00:04:33,902
But don't test my patience.
lf he hesitates, l'll nail him.

34
00:04:34,152 --> 00:04:35,904
l'll talk to him.

35
00:04:36,154 --> 00:04:37,113
And Mr. Racine. . .

36
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:43,786
. . .next time you come to my courtroom,
either get a better defense. . .

37
00:04:44,787 --> 00:04:47,373
. . .or a better class of client.

38
00:04:48,124 --> 00:04:50,251
Thank you, Your Honor.

39
00:05:05,725 --> 00:05:08,686
l underestimated you.
Don't know why it took me so long.

40
00:05:08,937 --> 00:05:11,022
You use your incompetence
as a weapon.

41
00:05:11,272 --> 00:05:15,193
My defense was evolving
and you guys got scared.

42
00:05:15,443 --> 00:05:18,238
NED: Costanza doesn't like me.
What'd l do to him?

43
00:05:18,488 --> 00:05:20,740
LOWENSTElN:
He thinks he belongs in circuit court.

44
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:25,578
He's here with top-notch corruption
and stuck with the county toilets.

45
00:05:25,829 --> 00:05:29,290
Surprised you weren't in on the caper.
Could've been your quick score.

46
00:05:29,541 --> 00:05:33,086
Or maybe Costanza was in on it.
That's why he was so mad.

47
00:05:33,336 --> 00:05:36,589
What's the good word from the
halls of justice? Anything juicy?

48
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:40,301
Maybe Stella was in on it. When
will you get a real air conditioner?

49
00:05:40,552 --> 00:05:42,762
You don't like it,
there are other places.

50
00:05:43,012 --> 00:05:45,348
They don't have you.
l've got to go.

51
00:05:47,308 --> 00:05:49,102
You can't buy me.

52
00:05:49,352 --> 00:05:51,312
l don't come cheap.

53
00:05:52,689 --> 00:05:54,149
MAN:
Lowenstein, you're a fag.

54
00:05:54,566 --> 00:05:57,610
-Why does he do that?
-He's good. That's the weird part.

55
00:05:57,861 --> 00:06:00,363
-You hear about Dr. Block?
-No. Do l want to?

56
00:06:00,613 --> 00:06:02,157
Agnes Marshall.

57
00:06:02,407 --> 00:06:04,868
Must've been
Mrs. Block's idea of punishment.

58
00:06:05,118 --> 00:06:07,454
That's right.
How did you know that?

59
00:06:07,704 --> 00:06:09,914
You are better plugged in than l am.

60
00:06:10,623 --> 00:06:13,626
l guess you know about
Mrs. Block's friend in Ocean Grove.

61
00:06:13,877 --> 00:06:17,755
Stella, this is beneath even you.
Things must be slow.

62
00:06:19,048 --> 00:06:20,717
STELLA:
lt's the heat.

63
00:08:04,988 --> 00:08:09,200
You can stand here with me, but you
must agree not to speak of the heat.

64
00:08:14,372 --> 00:08:15,915
l'm a married woman.

65
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:19,753
-Meaning what?
-Meaning l'm not looking for company.

66
00:08:20,003 --> 00:08:22,088
Should've said,
''a happily married woman. ''

67
00:08:22,338 --> 00:08:24,215
That's my business.

68

What?

69
00:08:25,633 --> 00:08:28,595
-How happy l am.
-And how happy is that?

70
00:08:29,679 --> 00:08:31,181
Not too smart, are you?

71
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:33,641
l like that in a man.

72
00:08:33,892 --> 00:08:37,812
What else do you like? Lazy?
Ugly? Horny? l've got them all.

73
00:08:38,063 --> 00:08:39,981
You don't look lazy.

74
00:08:41,483 --> 00:08:44,903
Tell me, does chat like this
work with most women?

75
00:08:45,362 --> 00:08:47,280
lf they haven't been around much.

76
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:50,033

-l told you, l've got a husband.

-l'll buy him one too.
-He's out of town.

79
00:08:58,249 --> 00:09:01,378
My favorite kind.
We'll drink to him.

80
00:09:01,628 --> 00:09:03,963
He only comes up on weekends.

81
00:09:04,214 --> 00:09:06,549
l'm liking him better all the time.

82

Take me up on this quick.
ln 45 minutes l'll get up and go away.

83

Want to buy me something?
l'll take one of those.

84
00:09:17,143 --> 00:09:18,853
-What kind?
-Cherry.

85

NED:
Two cherries.

86

You're not staying in Miranda Beach.

MATTY: ls this town that small?

88

Pinehaven?

89
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:41,459
You're staying down in Pinehaven.

90
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:43,128
On the waterway.

91
00:09:47,465 --> 00:09:50,593
-You have a house.
-How do you know that?

92
00:09:50,844 --> 00:09:52,846
You look like Pinehaven.

93
00:09:53,096 --> 00:09:54,597
How does Pinehaven look?

94
00:09:55,724 --> 00:09:59,269
-Well-tended.
-l'm well-tended, all right.

95
00:10:00,145 --> 00:10:01,730
Well-tended.

96
00:10:03,606 --> 00:10:04,941
What about you?

97
00:10:05,191 --> 00:10:06,609
Me?

98
00:10:08,069 --> 00:10:11,072
l need tending. l need
someone to take care of me. . .

99

. . .someone to rub my tired muscles,
smooth out my sheets.

100
00:10:15,452 --> 00:10:17,078
Get married.

101
00:10:17,704 --> 00:10:19,080
l just need it for tonight.

102
00:10:22,834 --> 00:10:24,127
Nice move, Matty.

103
00:10:24,377 --> 00:10:27,714
Matty? l like it.
lt's right over your heart.

104
00:10:27,964 --> 00:10:31,968
-At least it's cool. l was burning up.
-No talking about the heat.

105
00:10:32,218 --> 00:10:35,138
Would you get me a paper towel,
dip it in cold water?

106
00:10:35,388 --> 00:10:38,016
Right away.
l'll even wipe it off for you.

107

MATTY:
You don't want to lick it?

108

Look who's here.
lsn't this a coincidence.

NED:
l know you.

110
00:12:48,063 --> 00:12:50,357
You're the one who hates
talking about heat.

111
00:12:50,607 --> 00:12:54,778
-Too bad. l'd talk about chimes.
-What about them?

112
00:12:55,028 --> 00:12:56,821
The wind chimes on my porch.

113
00:12:57,072 --> 00:13:00,075
They keep ringing
and l go out, expecting a cool breeze.

114
00:13:00,325 --> 00:13:02,869
That's what they always mean.
But not this year.

115
00:13:03,119 --> 00:13:05,121
This year it's just hot air.

116
00:13:05,372 --> 00:13:08,124
NED:
Do l remind you of hot air?

117
00:13:09,793 --> 00:13:12,837
Bourbon, any kind, on the rocks.
Do you want another?

118
00:13:16,383 --> 00:13:18,343
-What are you doing in Pinehaven?
-l'm no yokel.

119
00:13:18,593 --> 00:13:20,804
l was all the way to Miami once.

120

Some men, once they get a whiff of it,
they trail you like a hound.

l'm not that eager.

Matty Walker.

NED: You all right?
MATTY: Yes, l'm fine.

125

My temperature runs a couple
of degrees high, around 1 00.

126
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:43,660
l don't mind.
lt's the engine or something.

127
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:45,662
Maybe you need a tune-up.

128
00:13:45,912 --> 00:13:48,665
Don't tell me.
You have just the right tool.

l don't talk like that.

130

How did you find me, Ned?

131
00:14:03,096 --> 00:14:05,473
This is the only joint in Pinehaven.

132
00:14:06,725 --> 00:14:10,687
You shouldn't have come.
You're going to be disappointed.

133

NED:
What did l do?

134
00:14:19,779 --> 00:14:22,365
A lot of them have tried that seat.

You're the first l've let stay.

136
00:14:25,702 --> 00:14:27,746
You must come here a lot.

137
00:14:28,914 --> 00:14:31,875
-Most men are little boys.
-Maybe you should drink at home.

138
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:34,961
-Too quiet.
-Maybe you shouldn't dress like that.

139
00:14:35,212 --> 00:14:38,590
This is a blouse and skirt.
l don't know what you mean.

140
00:14:39,007 --> 00:14:41,343
Then you shouldn't wear that body.

141
00:14:44,888 --> 00:14:46,181
Sometimes, l don't know.

142
00:14:46,765 --> 00:14:51,436
l just get so sick of everything,
l'm not sure l care anymore.

Do you know what l mean?

l know sometimes the shit comes down
so heavy l feel l should wear a hat.

145
00:15:04,449 --> 00:15:06,117
That's what l mean.

146
00:15:09,287 --> 00:15:11,039

147
00:15:11,289 --> 00:15:13,375

l want to see the chimes.

150
00:15:20,674 --> 00:15:22,300
You want to see the chimes.

l want to hear them.

152

That's all.

00:32:55,312 --> 00:32:58,816
MATTY: l know they own that place
in Miranda Beach, The Breakers.

312
00:32:59,275 --> 00:33:02,403
NED: The Breakers? l thought
Morrie Fisher owned that land.

313
00:33:02,653 --> 00:33:04,446
Edmund mentioned it once.

314
00:33:05,281 --> 00:33:07,700
lt scares me
to talk about these things.

315
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:08,909
NED:
Why?

316
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,245
MATTY: You know.
NED: No, l don't.

317
00:33:11,495 --> 00:33:14,498
Let's just not.
Let's not think about all he's got.

318
00:33:14,748 --> 00:33:16,292
NED:
Wait a minute.

319
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:20,212
Tell me exactly what it is
that frightens you.

320
00:33:22,131 --> 00:33:24,133
l'm afraid because. . .

321
00:33:25,384 --> 00:33:27,261
. . .when l think about it. . .

322
00:33:27,511 --> 00:33:29,388
. . .l wish he'd die.

323
00:33:30,222 --> 00:33:34,477
That's really what l want.
lt's horrible and it's ugly. . .

324
00:33:34,810 --> 00:33:36,812
. . .and it's what l most want.

325
00:33:38,731 --> 00:33:41,442
NED: That's where we're at, isn't it?
-What do you mean?

326
00:33:41,692 --> 00:33:46,071
NED: That's what we're both thinking.
How good it would be if he was gone.

327
00:33:46,322 --> 00:33:48,991
No, please.
Don't talk about it.

328
00:33:49,241 --> 00:33:51,118
Talk is dangerous,
makes things happen.

329
00:33:51,368 --> 00:33:53,454
-lt makes them real.
NED: Don't get scared.

330
00:33:53,704 --> 00:33:55,790
Because he is not going to die.

331
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:59,585
Nothing wrong with him, is there?
No reason to think he'll die?

332
00:34:00,044 --> 00:34:03,380
That's right.
So we might as well forget about it.

333
00:34:03,756 --> 00:34:06,884
lt's not going to just happen
to make things nice for us.

334
00:34:08,135 --> 00:34:10,095
lt won't just happen.

335
00:34:37,123 --> 00:34:39,041
NED: lf you leave him,
you'll do all right.

336
00:34:39,291 --> 00:34:41,502
MATTTY: A divorce?
NED: Yeah, he's ripe.

337
00:34:41,752 --> 00:34:44,797
No. l signed a prenuptial agreement.

338
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:48,342
-What?
-He insisted.

339
00:34:48,592 --> 00:34:53,013
He blamed it on his sister, Roz.
She hates me, but he wanted it too.

340
00:34:53,556 --> 00:34:56,100
-How is it?
-lt's bad.

341
00:34:56,517 --> 00:34:59,770
l get some money for a year,
not much. That's it.

342
00:35:03,566 --> 00:35:07,570
Does it matter, Ned?
Tell me the truth, please.

343
00:35:08,863 --> 00:35:13,451
The truth!
l wish you were going to be loaded.

344
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,329
Does it matter? No.

345
00:35:25,421 --> 00:35:27,840
God, you make me happy!

346
00:35:32,136 --> 00:35:34,138
lt's time for your present.

347
00:35:43,314 --> 00:35:47,568
Now, when it starts coming down on you,
l'll be there to protect you.

348
00:35:54,241 --> 00:35:56,869
Try it on.
l bet l guessed the size right.

349
00:36:03,417 --> 00:36:04,627
l love it!

350
00:36:05,336 --> 00:36:06,879
NED:
l want to see.

351
00:36:06,921 --> 00:36:07,588
MATTY:
Here.

352
00:36:30,486 --> 00:36:32,113
Hello, sweetheart.

353
00:36:32,363 --> 00:36:34,615
Have l got a nice present for you!

354
00:36:35,825 --> 00:36:37,702
Hi, Aunt Matty.

355
00:36:38,577 --> 00:36:40,162
Heather.

356
00:36:41,414 --> 00:36:43,999
EDMUND: What is it again?
HEATHER: Rover.

357
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:47,461
HEATHER: lt's between first and second.
EDMUND: That's not a shortstop?

358
00:36:47,712 --> 00:36:50,464
No. The shortstop is between
second and third.

359
00:36:50,715 --> 00:36:52,550
Good, that's the way l remember it.

360
00:36:52,967 --> 00:36:54,677
EDMUND:
Have a good time.

361
00:36:56,429 --> 00:36:58,180
You don't really mind, do you?

362
00:36:58,431 --> 00:36:59,682
Roz will pick her up Thursday.

363
00:37:00,558 --> 00:37:03,144
Don't worry.
Roz won't stay overnight.

364
00:37:03,894 --> 00:37:05,896
She can do whatever she wants.

365
00:37:46,812 --> 00:37:49,649
Oh, my God!
You scared me.

366
00:37:51,651 --> 00:37:53,903
You shouldn't be here.
Heather's upstairs.

367
00:37:54,153 --> 00:37:55,946
NED: Asleep.
And l know what l want.

368
00:37:56,197 --> 00:38:00,451
l know. l missed you so badly,
but it's too dangerous.

369
00:38:00,743 --> 00:38:02,995
-She won't wake now.
-You're so wet.

370
00:38:03,245 --> 00:38:05,331
NED:
l waited out there for 2 hours.

371
00:38:05,831 --> 00:38:07,416
MATTY:
You're so salty.

372
00:38:10,169 --> 00:38:11,462
MATTY:
Let me.

373
00:38:13,881 --> 00:38:15,216
Lie back.

374
00:38:15,466 --> 00:38:16,759
HEATHER:
Aunt Matty?

375
00:38:25,726 --> 00:38:26,852
What do you say?

376
00:38:27,103 --> 00:38:29,146
-l did!
MATTY: She did.

377
00:38:29,397 --> 00:38:31,357
Thank you, Aunt Matty.

378
00:38:31,607 --> 00:38:35,820
-Thanks, Matty. We appreciate it.
-A pleasure, Roz. Any time.

379
00:39:09,895 --> 00:39:13,566
-lt's just me tonight, Filomena.
-Okay. Just one minute.

380
00:39:16,235 --> 00:39:17,570
Well, hello to you!

381
00:39:19,488 --> 00:39:23,576
Darling, this is Mr. Racine.
l'm sorry, l don't know your first name.

382
00:39:25,411 --> 00:39:26,370
Ned.

383
00:39:27,246 --> 00:39:28,664
Edmund Walker.
Nice to meet you.

384
00:39:29,957 --> 00:39:32,084
Mr. Racine is the lawyer
l told you about.

385
00:39:32,335 --> 00:39:35,838
You remember. He had a client
who wanted to buy the house.

386
00:39:36,088 --> 00:39:37,882
MATTY: l told him we weren't selling.
-Right.

387
00:39:38,132 --> 00:39:39,383
NED:
That hasn't changed, has it?

388
00:39:40,468 --> 00:39:42,136
No, we're very happy with it.

389
00:39:43,012 --> 00:39:45,431
l can understand that.
lt's a terrific place.

390
00:39:46,641 --> 00:39:47,558
Are you going in?

391
00:39:48,225 --> 00:39:49,727
l was going to grab a bite.

392
00:39:50,645 --> 00:39:52,021
Join us.

393
00:39:52,271 --> 00:39:55,650
-No! Thanks, l don't want to interfere.
-No. Don't be silly.

394
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:57,777
We have room for three, don't we?

395
00:39:58,444 --> 00:40:00,488
EDMUND: lt's great,
but you can't get near it on weekends.

396
00:40:01,155 --> 00:40:04,408
-l don't get down during the week much.
NED: ls that right?

397
00:40:06,619 --> 00:40:09,830
l was a lawyer.
l still am, but l don't practice.

398
00:40:10,081 --> 00:40:13,042
-l went to Columbia. And you?
NED: F.S.U.

399
00:40:13,292 --> 00:40:17,088
EDMUND: A good school.
l got bored with it quick.

400
00:40:17,338 --> 00:40:19,340
l didn't have the temperament for it.

401
00:40:19,924 --> 00:40:22,134
l wanted to make the money faster.

402
00:40:22,385 --> 00:40:23,970
EDMUND:
ls there a living in it here?

403
00:40:24,595 --> 00:40:27,557
l can afford to send out my shirts. . .

404
00:40:27,807 --> 00:40:31,727
. . .and eat here once a month
if l don't order an appetizer.

405
00:40:34,105 --> 00:40:38,776
Honest lawyers don't make much
and the other kind are too slimy for me.

406
00:40:39,026 --> 00:40:41,779
l'd rather be up-front
about shafting somebody.

407
00:40:42,071 --> 00:40:42,989
MATTY:
Edmund, really!

408
00:40:43,239 --> 00:40:45,616
-lt's his profession.
NED: That's all right.

409
00:40:45,866 --> 00:40:47,201
l don't like it much.

410
00:40:47,451 --> 00:40:49,412
Call me Ned, will you?

411
00:40:50,413 --> 00:40:51,789
EDMUND:
What's to like?

412
00:40:52,290 --> 00:40:55,334
lt's the way of the world.
Most people despise their jobs.

413
00:40:55,585 --> 00:40:56,878
Do you?

414
00:40:59,171 --> 00:41:00,464
EDMUND:
No, l love it.

415
00:41:01,215 --> 00:41:03,092
But it's not a job.

416
00:41:03,426 --> 00:41:05,553
What is it exactly?

417
00:41:08,097 --> 00:41:10,600
l do various things.
This and that.

418
00:41:10,850 --> 00:41:13,477
EDMUND: Here and there.
NED: You don't have to be specific.

419
00:41:16,272 --> 00:41:19,358
Finance, basically.
Venture capital, real estate. . .

420
00:41:19,609 --> 00:41:21,777
. . .investments.
We're into a few things.

421
00:41:22,570 --> 00:41:24,155
-Around here?
EDMUND: Some.

422
00:41:24,655 --> 00:41:25,573
EDMUND:
Some things here.

423
00:41:25,823 --> 00:41:28,034
Edmund's company owns The Breakers.

424
00:41:28,951 --> 00:41:32,038
NED: Really?
EDMUND: lt's not that simple, really.

425
00:41:32,288 --> 00:41:34,999
We have an interest
in a few places along the shore.

426
00:41:35,249 --> 00:41:38,002
For the land, someday.

427
00:41:38,711 --> 00:41:40,087
Don't try explaining it to her.

428
00:41:40,838 --> 00:41:43,549
l'm too dumb.
A woman, you know.

429
00:41:45,801 --> 00:41:47,303
l'll be right back.

430
00:41:47,887 --> 00:41:52,558
Then maybe we can talk about
pantyhose or something interesting.

431
00:41:59,357 --> 00:42:01,025
She's something, isn't she?

432
00:42:01,275 --> 00:42:03,277
NED:
She is a lovely lady.

433
00:42:03,528 --> 00:42:05,154
EDMUND:
Yes, she is.

434
00:42:05,404 --> 00:42:07,365
And l'm crazy about her.

435
00:42:08,533 --> 00:42:10,493
lf l thought she was seeing
another guy. . . .

436
00:42:10,993 --> 00:42:12,495
l don't know.

437
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:16,123
l could understand how it could happen,
the way she is.

438
00:42:16,374 --> 00:42:17,792
l could understand it, but. . .

439
00:42:18,918 --> 00:42:22,004
. . .l think l'd kill the guy
with my bare hands.

440
00:42:22,672 --> 00:42:24,507
That's understanding.

441
00:42:28,678 --> 00:42:29,679
NED:
Please.

442
00:42:30,346 --> 00:42:33,850
You'd never believe the dorkus
she was with when l met her.

443
00:42:34,559 --> 00:42:37,728
The guy came to us
with a business proposition.

444
00:42:38,771 --> 00:42:40,940
We're always looking for opportunities.

445
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,484
We're willing to take a risk. . .

446
00:42:43,734 --> 00:42:46,863
. . .if the downside's not too steep,
if conditions are right.

447
00:42:47,113 --> 00:42:50,324
But this guy,
he hadn't done his homework.

448
00:42:50,575 --> 00:42:54,495
He didn't know the bottom line.
That's how l knew he was full of shit.

449
00:42:54,745 --> 00:42:58,166
Got to know the bottom line.
That's all that counts.

450
00:42:58,416 --> 00:43:00,710
But he didn't have the goods,
this guy.

451
00:43:02,211 --> 00:43:03,838
Like lots of guys you run into. . .

452
00:43:04,088 --> 00:43:08,134
. . .they want to get rich, do it quick,
be there with one score. . . .

453
00:43:08,551 --> 00:43:12,597
But they're not willing to do
what's necessary. You know what l mean?

454
00:43:12,847 --> 00:43:16,601
l'm not sure. You mean
do the groundwork? Earn it?

455
00:43:18,144 --> 00:43:20,646
No, l mean,
do what's necessary.

456
00:43:21,314 --> 00:43:23,441
Whatever is necessary.

457
00:43:27,445 --> 00:43:31,991
l know that kind of guy.
l hate that. lt makes me sick.

458
00:43:33,326 --> 00:43:34,202
Me too.

459
00:43:34,577 --> 00:43:36,746
l'm a lot like that.

460
00:44:11,864 --> 00:44:14,951
BEVERLY: Some messages are on your desk.
l'll be back in an hour.

461
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:39,142
Jesus!
Did Beverly see you?

462
00:44:39,976 --> 00:44:41,727
l waited until l saw her leave.

463
00:44:42,854 --> 00:44:44,605
MATTY:
Please, don't be angry.

464
00:44:46,023 --> 00:44:48,359
Angry? l'm not angry.
How did you get in?

465
00:44:48,609 --> 00:44:50,111
MATTY:
lt didn't lock.

466
00:44:51,612 --> 00:44:53,197
Ned, hold me.

467
00:44:54,407 --> 00:44:55,324
Please.

468
00:44:56,909 --> 00:44:57,827
MATTY:
Just hold me.

469
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:01,330
MATTY:
God, l love you!

470
00:45:03,624 --> 00:45:05,084
MATTY:
He left this morning.

471
00:45:05,334 --> 00:45:07,587
MATTY: l had to see you.
NED: l know.

472
00:45:12,675 --> 00:45:13,843
l couldn't call.

473
00:45:14,093 --> 00:45:16,971
l was afraid to. l was afraid
you wouldn't let me come.

474
00:45:17,221 --> 00:45:19,015
You mustn't call.
Never call.

475
00:45:19,265 --> 00:45:21,768
Be careful.
The phone company keeps records.

476
00:45:22,101 --> 00:45:23,770
l am careful.

477
00:45:24,145 --> 00:45:25,396
Ned, l hated it.

478
00:45:25,646 --> 00:45:28,691
l hated sitting there with you two.
l thought l'd scream.

479
00:45:28,941 --> 00:45:30,777
You called my apartment from the house.

480
00:45:31,027 --> 00:45:32,737
MATTY: No, never.
-Those two times?

481
00:45:32,987 --> 00:45:34,614
MATTY:
l went to phone booths.

482
00:45:34,864 --> 00:45:36,366
l'm afraid of him--

483
00:45:36,699 --> 00:45:40,119
That's good. Be very careful now
about the phones.

484
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:43,081
-Why say this now?
-We can account for some calls.

485
00:45:43,331 --> 00:45:45,041
We've had some contact.

486
00:45:45,291 --> 00:45:47,460
Why?
What's happened?

487
00:45:50,421 --> 00:45:52,423
Because we're going to kill him.

488
00:45:55,176 --> 00:45:57,470
We both know that.

489
00:45:59,639 --> 00:46:01,474
lt's what you want, isn't it?

490
00:46:02,475 --> 00:46:04,310
We knew it was coming.

491
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:07,146
lt's the only way we can
have everything we want.

492
00:46:23,746 --> 00:46:25,873
That man is going to die. . .

493
00:46:26,958 --> 00:46:30,670
. . .for no reason but we want him dead.

494
00:46:33,089 --> 00:46:35,967
He doesn't deserve it.
Let's not ever say that.

495
00:46:37,552 --> 00:46:42,515
We'll do it for us. You get half of all
he owns, that's what the will says.

496
00:46:46,144 --> 00:46:47,854
NED:
That's it, then.

497
00:46:51,649 --> 00:46:53,359
We're going to kill him.

498
00:46:54,110 --> 00:46:55,903
And l think l know how.

499
00:46:56,154 --> 00:46:58,614
-lt's real, then?
-lt's real, all right.

500
00:47:03,286 --> 00:47:06,706
And if we're not careful,
it'll be the last real thing we do.

501
00:48:28,288 --> 00:48:32,000
MATTY: Her mother works plenty hard
to keep Heather on Edmund's mind.

502
00:48:32,250 --> 00:48:36,713
Always bringing her around,
reporting on what she does in school.

503
00:48:37,171 --> 00:48:39,257
That Roz is a smart one.

504
00:48:39,632 --> 00:48:43,720
And anything Heather inherits goes
to Roz. Heather won't even see it.

505
00:48:43,970 --> 00:48:47,849
That's what seems so wrong,
that half of it should go to her.

506
00:48:48,099 --> 00:48:50,685
There's nothing we can do about it.

507
00:48:50,935 --> 00:48:52,478
Are you sure?

508
00:48:52,770 --> 00:48:56,024
l was thinking that maybe there is.

509
00:48:56,274 --> 00:49:00,028
The will is with Edmund's lawyer
in Miami. l know that.

510
00:49:01,487 --> 00:49:03,698
What if l got him to bring it home?

511
00:49:04,198 --> 00:49:07,619
And couldn't we rewrite it?
Change it?

512
00:49:08,661 --> 00:49:11,581
Every change would mean a lot for us.

513
00:49:12,498 --> 00:49:14,042
You know how to write it.

514
00:49:14,959 --> 00:49:16,294
lt wouldn't seem so odd.

515
00:49:16,544 --> 00:49:21,549
l'd say he brought it home and we
decided to make some changes up here.

516
00:49:21,883 --> 00:49:23,760
-And l knew you already--
NED: No!

517
00:49:24,218 --> 00:49:25,470
Forget it.

518
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:27,305
Why should Heather take half?

519
00:49:29,015 --> 00:49:31,643
Nothing strange can happen
in his life now.

520
00:49:31,893 --> 00:49:34,854
Not one thing out of the ordinary.

521
00:49:35,521 --> 00:49:37,148
That's the most important thing.

522
00:49:37,398 --> 00:49:40,693
lf it does,
the chances double that we get caught.

523
00:49:41,736 --> 00:49:43,571
You'll get half of everything.

524
00:49:43,821 --> 00:49:47,659
lt'll be plenty, no matter what.
We won't get greedy.

525
00:49:50,245 --> 00:49:52,372
lf we do, we'll get burned.

526
00:49:55,416 --> 00:49:57,001
You're right, darling.

527
00:49:58,545 --> 00:50:00,630
l'm sorry.
l know you're right.

528
00:50:17,397 --> 00:50:20,066
l know where he is.
lt's not far from here.

529
00:50:22,110 --> 00:50:25,196
-l don't want you with me.
-l thought we settled that.

530
00:50:25,446 --> 00:50:26,823
l'll wait in the car. . .

531
00:50:27,073 --> 00:50:30,827

We're both doing this.

lt's fast, it's hot, it's simple.

535

You can use the clock

lt will go with just the mag chips.

Regular, unleaded, supreme.
Whatever you like, Counselor.

540
00:51:25,173 --> 00:51:28,134
l got to tell you, though,
this mama has a big drawback.

00:51:28,510 --> 00:51:30,011
lt's easy to spot.

Even after the meltdown,
they're going to know it's arson.

Are you listening to me, asshole?
