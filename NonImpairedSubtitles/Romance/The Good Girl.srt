1
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:11,238
Justine: As a girl,
you see the world

2
00:01:11,363 --> 00:01:13,490
like a giant candy store...

3
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:13,866
filled with sweet candy
and such.

4
00:01:13,866 --> 00:01:16,493
filled with sweet candy
and such.

5
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:21,915
But one day you look around
and see a prison...

6
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,001
and you're on death row.

7
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,714
You want to run...

8
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:30,841
or scream...

9
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:33,260
or cry.

10
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:35,512
But something's
locking you up.

11
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:43,228
Are the other folks
cows chewing cud

12
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:46,231
till the hour come
when their heads roll?

13
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:53,947
Or are they just
keeping quiet like you?

14
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:00,537
Planning their escape.

15
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:09,922
On your left, honey.

16
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:11,548
What's that cashier's name?

17
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:13,091
Can't say.

18
00:02:13,175 --> 00:02:15,219
When did he start
working here?

19
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:17,596
Don't know. Yesterday.

20
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:20,641
Who is he?

21
00:02:20,766 --> 00:02:23,018
Don't know. Can't say.

22
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:24,770
What are you doing?

23
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:26,563
It's called work,
princess.

24
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,065
Kind of fun.

25
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:30,400
You might want to
give it a go some day.

26
00:02:30,526 --> 00:02:32,444
Woman, Listlessly Over P. A:
Attention, shoppers.

27
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:36,240
There's a Retail Rodeo special
on aisle 3.

28
00:02:36,365 --> 00:02:39,785
Liquid Drain Cleaner,
2 1 2-ounce cans for $5.00.

29
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:42,079
Liquid Drain Cleaner
has churning power...

30
00:02:42,204 --> 00:02:45,415
and it will churn
right through your pipes.

31
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:47,584
Ladies,
you need female plumbing.

32
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:50,462
Shove something clean and new
up your filthy pipes.

33
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:53,465
That's Liquid Drain Cleaner
on aisle 3.

34
00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:54,967
Have a good day...

35
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,761
and thank you for shopping
at Retail Rodeo.

36
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:02,891
Hey, Justine.

37
00:03:02,975 --> 00:03:04,601
Can I talk to you
for a second?

38
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:05,602
Yeah.

39
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:07,437
I was just curious, uh...

40
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:09,439
have you ever been
to a Bible study?

41
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:10,941
Yeah.

42
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,276
Yeah, well, we got
a good one going on

43
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:13,402
every Wednesday

44
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:14,862
at the First Church
of Nazarene.

45
00:03:14,987 --> 00:03:17,072
Rodney comes,
Bonita comes.

46
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:20,492
You got any interest
in reading the Bible?

47
00:03:20,576 --> 00:03:23,829
I have my own,
you know, beliefs.

48
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:25,873
Well, we don't preach
fire and brimstone.

49
00:03:25,998 --> 00:03:27,708
1 0 Commandments...
gotta live by those.

50
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:29,543
Other than
the usual ways...

51
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:31,295
we're not interested
in scaring people.

52
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:32,880
We're about loving Jesus.

53
00:03:33,005 --> 00:03:35,966
Mm-hmm. Yeah, I kind of like
my nights to myself.

54
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,968
Well, maybe you'll have
night after night

55
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,845
of eternal hellfire
all to yourself.

56
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:42,139
Just kidding you.
Drive safe.

57
00:03:43,265 --> 00:03:44,808
Bye-bye.

58
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:13,879
Man: Hey, Justine.

59
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:16,548
Hey, Teeny.
How was your day?

60
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:20,093
The same. How was yours?

61
00:04:20,219 --> 00:04:23,096
Wind was fipping up paint
in our eyes.

62
00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:26,517
Paint stings.

63
00:04:26,642 --> 00:04:27,768
Feel like
I've been attacked

64
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:30,354
by hornets
in my eyeballs.

65
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:34,399
Bubba, stand up.

66
00:04:34,525 --> 00:04:35,484
Why?

67
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:40,864
Oh, for Christ sakes.

68
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:43,033
Look at that couch, Phil.

69
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:45,077
Y'all got paint all over it.

70
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:47,871
This ain't gonna come off.

71
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:50,249
I bet the... Damn it, Phil.

72
00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:55,546
Including this gorgeous
eggplant shape...

73
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:03,595
I think we got
most of it up.

74
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:06,890
You two were stoned.

75
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:08,141
Keep frying
your brain like that...

76
00:05:08,267 --> 00:05:09,226
you're gonna
slip off a ladder

77
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,311
and crack open
your head bone.

78
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:13,605
You do really stupid things
when you're high, Phil.

79
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,816
Like what?

80
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:18,902
Like sitting on my couch
with your big blue ass.

81
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:22,573
Everything
just turns to shit.

82
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:24,074
We're finally getting
nice things...

83
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,535
and then everything
just gets messed up.

84
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:28,245
Why is this TV buzzing?

85
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,372
Oh, it's the wind
doing that.

86
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,084
They say
the wind's coming in

87
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:35,836
different lately.

88
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:37,796
Different from what?

89
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,118
Justine:
What you reading?

90
00:06:10,746 --> 00:06:12,664
Catcher in the Rye.

91
00:06:12,748 --> 00:06:15,292
I'm named after it.

92
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,044
What's your name,
Catcher?

93
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:18,629
Holden.

94
00:06:18,754 --> 00:06:20,172
After Holden Caulfield.

95
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:22,716
He's the main character.

96
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:24,301
What's he do?

97
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:27,721
He's put upon by society...

98
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:30,015
the hypocrisy of the world.

99
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,646
I notice that you're,
uh, not very social.

100
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:38,315
I'm a writer, so...

101
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,316
What do you write?

102
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:42,277
Novels, plays,
screenplays...

103
00:06:42,361 --> 00:06:44,821
stories, poetry.

104
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:47,741
Gwen: That's good.

105
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:49,576
Now Justine will be
right over with you.

106
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:50,702
Where is she?

107
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,663
Oh, I better go.

108
00:06:57,543 --> 00:07:01,004
W-What happens
at the end of your book?

109
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:02,339
Oh, he has
a nervous breakdown...

110
00:07:02,464 --> 00:07:05,050
goes to
a mental hospital.

111
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:09,847
Hmm.

112
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:13,475
You don't get paid
to pick your crack.

113
00:07:13,559 --> 00:07:15,185
You get paid to work.

114
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:18,355
I'm not sure
I can do makeovers.

115
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,566
Oh, come on. A little
pancake, eyeliner...

116
00:07:20,691 --> 00:07:22,150
mascara,
rouge on the cheeks...

117
00:07:22,234 --> 00:07:23,569
and powder it up.

118
00:07:23,694 --> 00:07:25,195
And then you take
a moist tissue...

119
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,238
roll it in a ball...

120
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:28,407
and toss it
in their face.

121
00:07:31,243 --> 00:07:33,579
Geez Louise, I'm talking
to a tree stump, girl.

122
00:07:33,704 --> 00:07:34,788
Where are you?

123
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:36,832
Sorry. I'm just
a little tired.

124
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:37,958
I'm telling you...

125
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:39,710
it's the food you eat,
Justine.

126
00:07:39,835 --> 00:07:41,879
Look at me... I am
1 0 years older than you...

127
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:44,256
and I've got
1 0 times your energy.

128
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:47,885
'Cause I don't eat meat,
and I don't eat dairy.

129
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:50,387
It's probably why you can't
get pregnant, honey.

130
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,722
Why you walk around

131
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:53,265
with that hung-jaw look
on your face.

132
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:55,225
It's the cheese
in your pizza

133
00:07:55,309 --> 00:07:56,768
and the chicken
in your salad.

134
00:07:56,852 --> 00:07:59,438
I've been to the doctor.
He says I'm fertile.

135
00:07:59,563 --> 00:08:01,648
Says I could repopulate
the entire planet.

136
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:03,108
Then what's the deal here?

137
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:05,527
Did he say you're
getting enough vitamins?

138
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:09,239
He didn't say.

139
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:19,208
Phil: Or you can make
a kind of paint

140
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:21,293
where,
at different angles...

141
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:23,587
the house
is different colors.

142
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:28,175
Like, you stand
at the front door...

143
00:08:29,301 --> 00:08:31,970
and the house is red.

144
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:33,639
But you stand
at the street...

145
00:08:33,764 --> 00:08:35,641
the house is green.

146
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:39,895
Or you could make, like,
an invisible paint.

147
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:42,064
Just make
the whole house disappear.

148
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:45,275
Or what would be really neat
is a paint that could

149
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,195
change the molecular structure
of a house...

150
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,323
like a chemical acid deal.

151
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:53,367
What do you think, Teeny?

152
00:08:53,492 --> 00:08:56,954
I think you two are
a pair of potheads.

153
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:03,043
OK, you getting a whole one
of these or a half?

154
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:04,586
I'm getting that
right there.

155
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:05,712
OK, wonderful.

156
00:09:05,838 --> 00:09:06,964
You didn't bring this
into the store with you?

157
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:08,090
No.

158
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:09,675
Then I'll go ahead
and charge you for it.

159
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,926
This is a hand lotion...

160
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:12,761
so don't put it on any
other part of your body...

161
00:09:12,845 --> 00:09:14,847
even if that part
needs lubrication.

162
00:09:14,972 --> 00:09:17,599
We try to keep frivolous
lawsuits to a minimum...

163
00:09:17,683 --> 00:09:19,393
unless, of course,
the customer is at fault.

164
00:09:19,518 --> 00:09:20,978
Do you
always wear makeup?

165
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:23,814
Oh, not very often.

166
00:09:23,939 --> 00:09:26,525
Here's your change,
and fuck you very much.

167
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:28,026
Excuse me?

168
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:30,320
Thank you very much.

169
00:09:30,404 --> 00:09:33,532
Good as new, I tell you.
Good as new.

170
00:09:33,657 --> 00:09:35,993
Now, you might be
interested in purchasing

171
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:38,120
some of the products
that I used today...

172
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:41,039
Oh, I'm not buying
anything today.

173
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:42,666
That'd be a mistake.

174
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:44,710
These are bargain prices.

175
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:47,588
I didn't bring my purse.

176
00:09:50,841 --> 00:09:52,926
I hate my job.

177
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:55,012
That makes two of us.

178
00:09:55,137 --> 00:09:56,680
I hate everybody here.

179
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,433
I hate Gwen.

180
00:09:59,558 --> 00:10:02,186
I don't know what the hell
she's so happy about.

181
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:06,523
I'm starting to understand
why maniacs go out there

182
00:10:06,607 --> 00:10:08,442
and get shotguns and
shoot everybody to pieces.

183
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,362
Maybe you're a maniac.

184
00:10:13,739 --> 00:10:15,115
Maybe so.

185
00:10:25,209 --> 00:10:28,253
You know your lips
are real pouty, like a woman?

186
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:30,589
And your eyes
always look sad...

187
00:10:30,714 --> 00:10:32,799
the way they droop
off to the side.

188
00:10:32,925 --> 00:10:34,259
How old are you?

189
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:36,929
Uh, 22.

190
00:10:37,054 --> 00:10:39,681
I'm an old lady next to you.

191
00:10:39,765 --> 00:10:41,683
How old are you?

192
00:10:41,767 --> 00:10:44,645
How old do you think?

193
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:47,606
I don't know.

194
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:53,070
I'm 30 years old.

195
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:57,950
How long you been
working here for?

196
00:10:58,075 --> 00:11:00,494
Forever and a day.

197
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:09,086
You don't have a car?

198
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:11,171
I live down the street.

199
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:13,882
You can ride in here.
There's room.

200
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:19,179
Do you wanna come in?

201
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:22,266
I don't know.
I'm in a funk.

202
00:11:23,851 --> 00:11:25,185
Well, I'm not
gonna beg you.

203
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:26,812
Well, I'm not
gonna beg you.

204
00:11:26,937 --> 00:11:29,898
Man, On TV: You got to
go there in your head...

205
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,820
And I did, and things
changed for me.

206
00:11:34,945 --> 00:11:36,613
I'll be in my room.

207
00:11:36,697 --> 00:11:38,490
Mother: OK, Tom.

208
00:11:40,951 --> 00:11:42,786
Man, On TV: I can look
over my shoulder...

209
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,955
figuratively speaking.

210
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:47,207
They call you Tom?

211
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:50,586
It's my slave name.

212
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:53,505
Holden's what I call myself.

213
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:57,968
This is my room.

214
00:11:59,094 --> 00:12:01,263
Not a lot to look at.

215
00:12:02,306 --> 00:12:04,850
What are your folks like?

216
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:09,688
They're OK.

217
00:12:09,813 --> 00:12:12,065
They don't get me.

218
00:12:12,191 --> 00:12:14,776
But they're all right.
They just...

219
00:12:15,861 --> 00:12:18,197
My husband doesn't get me.

220
00:12:19,323 --> 00:12:21,408
Since when do you
have a husband?

221
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:23,243
Since 7 years.

222
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:25,495
He's a painter.

223
00:12:28,207 --> 00:12:29,791
What's he paint?

224
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:31,585
Houses.

225
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:39,843
He's a pig. He talks,
but he doesn't think.

226
00:12:39,927 --> 00:12:41,803
I'm sick of it.

227
00:12:44,223 --> 00:12:46,183
Did you go to college?

228
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:49,186
Um, I had to drop out

229
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:51,480
'cause I had a problem
with drinking and stuff...

230
00:12:51,563 --> 00:12:53,690
but I'll go back.
I just got to...

231
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:56,818
prove to my folks
I can fy straight.

232
00:12:56,902 --> 00:12:59,363
Did you go to college?

233
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:03,283
I was afraid
I'd lose Phil if I went.

234
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:06,245
Now it'd be
reason enough to go.

235
00:13:12,543 --> 00:13:14,419
I was looking at you
in the store...

236
00:13:14,503 --> 00:13:16,922
and I liked how
you kept to yourself.

237
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:22,761
I saw in your eyes
that you hate the world.

238
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:26,056
I hate it, too.

239
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:31,937
You know what
I'm talking about?

240
00:13:49,913 --> 00:13:52,541
Justine: After living
in the dark for so long...

241
00:13:52,624 --> 00:13:55,252
a glimpse of the light
can make you giddy.

242
00:13:57,504 --> 00:13:59,506
Strange thoughts
come into your head...

243
00:13:59,631 --> 00:14:01,967
and you better think 'em.

244
00:14:05,095 --> 00:14:07,848
Has a special fate
been calling you

245
00:14:07,973 --> 00:14:09,433
and you not listening?

246
00:14:10,726 --> 00:14:14,188
Is there a secret message
right in front of you...

247
00:14:14,313 --> 00:14:16,148
and you're not reading it?

248
00:14:18,817 --> 00:14:21,778
Is this your last,
best chance?

249
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,326
Are you gonna take it?

250
00:14:31,121 --> 00:14:33,165
Or are you
going to the grave

251
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:35,709
with unlived lives
in your veins?

252
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:41,298
Notifying your wife,
for instance.

253
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:42,508
What did I say?

254
00:14:42,633 --> 00:14:43,717
If you had a wife.

255
00:14:43,842 --> 00:14:46,136
What did I talk about?

256
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:48,263
I talked to Margaret.

257
00:14:48,347 --> 00:14:51,683
She, uh, filled out a red dress.

258
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:53,477
What else?

259
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,811
Teeny, you're pretty.

260
00:14:54,937 --> 00:14:58,482
Bubba, isn't Teeny pretty?

261
00:14:58,607 --> 00:15:00,817
I seen better.
I seen worse.

262
00:15:01,944 --> 00:15:05,531
No, that's why
I ain't never married.

263
00:15:05,656 --> 00:15:09,076
You got yourself
the best fish in the sea.

264
00:15:10,869 --> 00:15:13,497
I wonder what it'd
be like to be a woman.

265
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:18,001
All that smooth skin...

266
00:15:18,085 --> 00:15:20,212
long hair.

267
00:15:20,337 --> 00:15:23,882
If I was a woman,
I'd be a slut.

268
00:15:25,008 --> 00:15:28,428
A lesbian slut.

269
00:15:29,721 --> 00:15:33,475
Gwen says smoking marijuana
lowers your sperm.

270
00:15:35,936 --> 00:15:38,021
Lowers it to where?

271
00:15:40,691 --> 00:15:42,901
Maybe you're the infertile one
around here.

272
00:15:43,026 --> 00:15:45,696
Maybe every time you smoke
a little doobie...

273
00:15:45,821 --> 00:15:48,240
you're killing
our unborn children.

274
00:15:56,915 --> 00:15:58,792
OK, close.

275
00:16:05,924 --> 00:16:08,385
Why are you limpin'?

276
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:14,224
l... I twisted up my ankle
on the stairs.

277
00:16:14,308 --> 00:16:15,559
Mm-hmm.

278
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:20,105
I was wondering maybe
you could give me a ride home.

279
00:16:20,189 --> 00:16:23,192
Yeah, sure, OK.

280
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:27,070
All right, I'll talk to you
about it later.

281
00:16:27,154 --> 00:16:28,280
Mm-hmm.

282
00:16:29,907 --> 00:16:32,701
All I know is, every woman
should have one beau

283
00:16:32,784 --> 00:16:35,162
before any woman has 2 beaus.

284
00:16:35,287 --> 00:16:38,624
He's not my beau.
He's my friend.

285
00:16:38,707 --> 00:16:41,960
Happy Halloween,
Retail Rodeo shoppers.

286
00:16:42,085 --> 00:16:46,965
There's a Retail Rodeo special
on all bulk candy on aisle 4.

287
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:51,053
Ghouls and goblins,
witches and warlocks...

288
00:16:51,136 --> 00:16:53,639
wandering these aisles
day after day...

289
00:16:53,764 --> 00:16:57,184
I put a Halloween curse
on your hellish heads.

290
00:16:57,309 --> 00:16:58,560
Good night, Corny.

291
00:16:58,644 --> 00:16:59,561
Good night.

292
00:16:59,645 --> 00:17:00,687
Happy Halloween.

293
00:17:00,812 --> 00:17:03,023
Oh, I'm not a pagan,
but thanks all the same.

294
00:17:04,566 --> 00:17:08,278
Which ankle
did you twist, Holden?

295
00:17:08,362 --> 00:17:09,696
My left.

296
00:17:09,821 --> 00:17:11,198
Hmm. Maybe you should

297
00:17:11,323 --> 00:17:13,283
put some cold water on it

298
00:17:13,408 --> 00:17:15,494
so it doesn't
swell up and infame.

299
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:17,746
OK.

300
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:25,754
You're a writer, so you have
yourself a goal, I guess.

301
00:17:27,756 --> 00:17:30,175
I used to, you know...

302
00:17:30,259 --> 00:17:34,596
lie in bed
and imagine other cities...

303
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:37,558
other jobs I could have...

304
00:17:37,683 --> 00:17:39,643
other husbands.

305
00:17:40,894 --> 00:17:44,481
Now I don't even know
what to imagine anymore.

306
00:18:07,296 --> 00:18:10,215
Holden, I have a husband.

307
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:13,552
Thought you said he was a pig.

308
00:18:13,677 --> 00:18:16,471
Well... Holden...

309
00:18:17,556 --> 00:18:20,184
I don't want
to hurt anybody.

310
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:38,160
Phil: So I been thinking
about what you're saying

311
00:18:38,243 --> 00:18:40,370
about my sperm being low.

312
00:18:41,455 --> 00:18:44,875
I mean, I know
I got good sperm.

313
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:47,669
It's baby-making sperm,
but...

314
00:18:48,754 --> 00:18:51,006
suppose it couldn't hurt

315
00:18:51,089 --> 00:18:53,717
to have it confirmed
by an expert.

316
00:18:53,842 --> 00:18:55,552
Oh, who gives a shit?

317
00:18:55,677 --> 00:18:57,221
Who needs
a fucking baby, anyway?

318
00:18:57,304 --> 00:18:58,972
You wanna make yourself
useful around here?

319
00:18:59,097 --> 00:19:01,225
Why don't you get
that goddamn TV fixed?

320
00:19:02,768 --> 00:19:04,102
What the hell?

321
00:19:04,228 --> 00:19:07,189
It sounds like a helicopter
is landing in here.

322
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:23,163
You want a blackberry,
honey?

323
00:19:23,288 --> 00:19:25,207
Man was selling 'em
on the road.

324
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:26,708
No, thank you.

325
00:19:26,792 --> 00:19:29,086
They're real sweet.

326
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:33,131
This is for you.
It's from Holden.

327
00:19:33,257 --> 00:19:35,050
Where is he?

328
00:19:35,133 --> 00:19:36,552
He's got the day off.

329
00:19:36,635 --> 00:19:38,554
He came by
this morning with it.

330
00:19:38,637 --> 00:19:39,763
Thanks.

331
00:19:39,847 --> 00:19:41,598
Don't mention it.
Hey, Gwen.

332
00:19:41,682 --> 00:19:42,599
Hi, sugar.

333
00:19:57,531 --> 00:20:00,117
Holden: DearJustine...

334
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,787
because of you,
I'll be quitting the Retail Rodeo.

335
00:20:05,539 --> 00:20:09,668
The last 2 days have been
the most god-awful of my life.

336
00:20:09,793 --> 00:20:12,421
I've not been able to get
rid of you in my head.

337
00:20:14,131 --> 00:20:16,633
I've never wanted
anything so bad...

338
00:20:16,717 --> 00:20:19,219
and I have wanted
many things.

339
00:20:19,344 --> 00:20:23,307
I'd given up long ago
on being gotten by someone else...

340
00:20:23,432 --> 00:20:25,851
and then you came along.

341
00:20:25,934 --> 00:20:29,146
The idea that I could be gotten
because of circumstance

342
00:20:29,229 --> 00:20:31,857
or never get got is the worst
feeling I've ever felt...

343
00:20:31,982 --> 00:20:34,443
and I have felt
many bad feelings.

344
00:20:34,526 --> 00:20:38,780
I'm sorry I can never
see you again, Justine.

345
00:20:38,864 --> 00:20:42,951
Forgive me for being so weak,
but that is who I am.

346
00:20:43,035 --> 00:20:45,078
Good-bye...

347
00:20:45,204 --> 00:20:46,705
Holden Worther.

348
00:20:51,376 --> 00:20:53,295
lf, for some reason...

349
00:20:53,378 --> 00:20:57,508
you could change your mind
and want to be with me...

350
00:20:57,591 --> 00:21:01,053
body and soul,
meet me after work.

351
00:21:01,136 --> 00:21:03,847
I will be waiting
for you at 5 p.m.

352
00:21:03,972 --> 00:21:05,682
outside Chuck E. Cheese.

353
00:21:05,807 --> 00:21:08,143
If you are not there
at 5:00...

354
00:21:08,227 --> 00:21:11,063
you will never see me again
in your lifetime.

355
00:21:14,233 --> 00:21:15,734
Gwen.

356
00:21:16,902 --> 00:21:18,028
Hmm.

357
00:21:18,111 --> 00:21:19,154
What's wrong?

358
00:21:19,238 --> 00:21:20,614
I'm OK.

359
00:21:20,739 --> 00:21:24,409
I feel a little sick.

360
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:33,544
Man On TV:
Let's go. There he goes.

361
00:21:41,218 --> 00:21:42,719
Man On TV:
What happened?

362
00:21:42,845 --> 00:21:44,471
Second Man On TV:
There he goes.

363
00:21:55,607 --> 00:21:56,733
Gwen?

364
00:21:56,859 --> 00:21:58,151
Gwen?

365
00:22:04,241 --> 00:22:05,617
Jack: Justine?

366
00:22:05,742 --> 00:22:06,910
You're OK.

367
00:22:06,994 --> 00:22:09,246
What's going on in here?

368
00:22:14,793 --> 00:22:17,296
Jesus.
Gwen, you sick?

369
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:23,343
We got... We gotta get her
to a hospital.

370
00:22:23,468 --> 00:22:25,846
Justine, you drive her
to Saint Catherine's.

371
00:22:25,971 --> 00:22:27,764
Well, what time is it?

372
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:31,059
It's a quarter to 5:00.
Why, you gotta be somewhere?

373
00:22:52,122 --> 00:22:52,998
Gwen.

374
00:22:53,123 --> 00:22:55,626
Oh, I had a dream.

375
00:22:55,709 --> 00:22:59,046
I had a dream I was sprouting
a beard made of bean sprouts.

376
00:22:59,171 --> 00:23:00,631
Oh.

377
00:23:00,756 --> 00:23:02,633
I'm gonna let you
off here, OK?

378
00:23:02,716 --> 00:23:06,220
OK. You'll meet me inside?

379
00:23:06,345 --> 00:23:09,306
Uh, well, yeah.
You know what I'm gonna do?

380
00:23:09,389 --> 00:23:10,974
I'm gonna park the car...

381
00:23:11,058 --> 00:23:12,309
and then I'll come in
and meet you in there.

382
00:23:12,392 --> 00:23:13,977
OK. Thanks.

383
00:23:16,647 --> 00:23:18,524
You're a doll.

384
00:23:53,725 --> 00:23:55,519
- Hey!
- Ohh!

385
00:23:56,603 --> 00:23:58,564
Oh, God, I'm really glad
you came.

386
00:23:58,689 --> 00:24:01,275
I just ditched Gwen
at the hospital.

387
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,359
Oh, God, thank God.

388
00:24:02,442 --> 00:24:03,360
Where are we going?

389
00:24:03,443 --> 00:24:04,361
Let's go to my house.

390
00:24:04,444 --> 00:24:06,280
No. With your folks there?

391
00:24:06,405 --> 00:24:07,948
We'll just park somewhere.

392
00:24:08,073 --> 00:24:09,533
Oh, this isn't well-planned.

393
00:24:09,616 --> 00:24:11,076
Look, I don't know.
I don't care.

394
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:11,577
Wherever you want.
I just want to hold you.

395
00:24:11,577 --> 00:24:13,537
Wherever you want.
I just want to hold you.

396
00:24:24,173 --> 00:24:26,049
That's $45 even.

397
00:24:26,133 --> 00:24:29,094
And I need you
to fill this out for me.

398
00:25:19,186 --> 00:25:21,146
Stay here.

399
00:25:54,638 --> 00:25:56,223
I can't do it.

400
00:25:57,349 --> 00:25:59,977
We'll be back here
before you know it.

401
00:26:03,021 --> 00:26:04,439
I don't want to.

402
00:26:04,523 --> 00:26:06,733
I don't want to go.

403
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:10,195
Justine.

404
00:26:12,322 --> 00:26:14,491
I'm yours.

405
00:26:14,575 --> 00:26:16,743
I'm all yours.

406
00:26:25,544 --> 00:26:26,545
Phil: Hey.

407
00:26:26,628 --> 00:26:27,754
Hey.

408
00:26:29,256 --> 00:26:30,549
Where you been?

409
00:26:32,843 --> 00:26:35,262
Gwen got real sick today.

410
00:26:35,387 --> 00:26:38,182
She was throwing up
all over the store.

411
00:26:38,265 --> 00:26:40,392
I had to take her
to the hospital

412
00:26:40,517 --> 00:26:42,311
and sat with her.

413
00:26:42,394 --> 00:26:45,022
Did she sick up on you?

414
00:26:45,105 --> 00:26:46,690
No.

415
00:26:47,774 --> 00:26:51,111
Did she sick up
on anybody?

416
00:26:51,236 --> 00:26:52,487
Ha ha ha ha.

417
00:26:52,571 --> 00:26:54,698
It's not funny, Phil.
It's serious.

418
00:26:54,823 --> 00:26:57,409
I'm gonna go by there
after work tomorrow, too.

419
00:26:57,534 --> 00:26:59,536
And the next day.

420
00:27:13,967 --> 00:27:16,553
Justine, what
happened to you?

421
00:27:16,678 --> 00:27:17,930
What?

422
00:27:18,055 --> 00:27:19,181
Went down
to Saint Catherine's

423
00:27:19,264 --> 00:27:20,390
to check up on Gwen.

424
00:27:20,516 --> 00:27:22,726
I looked all over for you.
She was asking for you.

425
00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:25,270
How is she?

426
00:27:25,354 --> 00:27:27,064
She was heaving up

427
00:27:27,189 --> 00:27:28,899
until there was
nothing left to heave.

428
00:27:28,982 --> 00:27:30,400
Doctor said she must've
eaten something

429
00:27:30,484 --> 00:27:31,902
with some kind
of parasite in it...

430
00:27:31,985 --> 00:27:33,487
some kind of bacteria.

431
00:27:33,612 --> 00:27:35,405
I bet it was
those blackberries.

432
00:27:35,531 --> 00:27:37,241
They're gonna
keep her in there

433
00:27:37,324 --> 00:27:39,159
until she gets better, so...

434
00:27:39,284 --> 00:27:42,621
you're gonna have to
supervise cosmetics.

435
00:27:57,469 --> 00:27:59,471
Stop it.
Somebody's gonna see.

436
00:27:59,596 --> 00:28:01,098
Who cares? I don't care.

437
00:28:01,223 --> 00:28:02,558
I crave you.

438
00:28:02,641 --> 00:28:06,937
I want to know everything
about you.

439
00:28:07,062 --> 00:28:08,689
Who are you?

440
00:28:10,899 --> 00:28:13,819
I'm just this woman.

441
00:28:13,944 --> 00:28:16,530
I moved to Texas
when I was 1 1.

442
00:28:16,655 --> 00:28:19,491
My daddy
was in the air force.

443
00:28:19,616 --> 00:28:23,287
I wanna knock your head open
and see what's inside.

444
00:28:23,412 --> 00:28:25,706
I've had so much pain
in my life.

445
00:28:25,831 --> 00:28:28,166
I know you have, too.
I can see it.

446
00:29:01,366 --> 00:29:05,162
Justine: Holden gave me two
of his stories to read.

447
00:29:05,287 --> 00:29:09,249
It was more like the story
of what a story would be.

448
00:29:09,374 --> 00:29:12,669
It was about a boy
who was put upon...

449
00:29:12,794 --> 00:29:15,506
whose mother
is cold and selfish

450
00:29:15,589 --> 00:29:19,676
and whose father wanted him
to play football.

451
00:29:20,928 --> 00:29:24,056
Other people didn't get him,
especially girls.

452
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,393
Soon enough,
the boy comes to believe

453
00:29:28,519 --> 00:29:30,521
that no one
can ever really know him.

454
00:29:30,646 --> 00:29:32,439
He starts acting out...

455
00:29:32,564 --> 00:29:36,360
drinking and taking all kinds
of drugs.

456
00:29:36,443 --> 00:29:39,029
At the end,
the boy kills himself

457
00:29:39,112 --> 00:29:41,114
by jumping over a bridge.

458
00:29:43,242 --> 00:29:45,702
The second story
was pretty much the same

459
00:29:45,786 --> 00:29:47,204
as the first...

460
00:29:47,287 --> 00:29:49,957
except, at the end,
the boy kills himself

461
00:29:50,082 --> 00:29:52,376
by drinking a bottle
of bug poison.

462
00:30:03,554 --> 00:30:06,223
Your stories are intense.

463
00:30:08,725 --> 00:30:11,895
I just want to leave
some kind of legacy.

464
00:30:11,979 --> 00:30:14,940
Something great.

465
00:30:15,023 --> 00:30:17,734
And after that, I don't
care what happens to me.

466
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:19,987
Don't say that.

467
00:30:24,032 --> 00:30:27,744
I wish there was
a story about me.

468
00:30:27,828 --> 00:30:31,790
I don't know who would
read it, though.

469
00:30:33,125 --> 00:30:35,252
I would.

470
00:30:38,046 --> 00:30:40,340
I like this.

471
00:30:42,301 --> 00:30:45,053
I like having a secret.

472
00:30:45,137 --> 00:30:47,097
You gave me a secret,
Holden.

473
00:30:47,181 --> 00:30:48,765
See?

474
00:30:48,891 --> 00:30:51,476
Now that you met me,
you're mysterious.

475
00:30:53,145 --> 00:30:55,772
And dark and twisted.

476
00:30:55,856 --> 00:30:57,941
I'm doomed to hell,
aren't I?

477
00:30:58,066 --> 00:30:59,776
Yes, you are.

478
00:31:12,873 --> 00:31:14,917
What is it?

479
00:31:16,043 --> 00:31:18,879
That's Bubba's truck.
Get in the car.

480
00:31:29,181 --> 00:31:31,892
Phil takes that truck
to work every day.

481
00:31:32,017 --> 00:31:34,603
Bubba picks him up
and drops him off.

482
00:31:34,686 --> 00:31:37,689
Why? Why would that truck
be parked there?

483
00:31:37,773 --> 00:31:40,817
Well, I don't know.

484
00:31:40,901 --> 00:31:43,403
If he finds out about us...

485
00:31:43,529 --> 00:31:45,822
I won't let him hurt you.

486
00:31:45,906 --> 00:31:48,283
He's big, Holden.
He'll kill you.

487
00:31:48,367 --> 00:31:50,702
He'll beat me,
but he will kill you.

488
00:31:50,827 --> 00:31:54,873
You can't worry about something
that hasn't even happened.

489
00:31:55,999 --> 00:31:58,252
I gotta go
to the hospital.

490
00:31:58,377 --> 00:31:59,336
All right.

491
00:31:59,461 --> 00:32:02,005
Don't. I mean,
he could be following us.

492
00:32:15,394 --> 00:32:16,395
Justine.

493
00:32:18,146 --> 00:32:22,025
Poor lady.
She just passed.

494
00:32:22,109 --> 00:32:23,569
What? Who did?

495
00:32:23,694 --> 00:32:26,822
Gwen.
She passed away.

496
00:32:29,199 --> 00:32:30,742
Wha... What do you mean?

497
00:32:30,868 --> 00:32:32,870
I thought
she had a stomachache.

498
00:32:32,953 --> 00:32:34,246
Well, she got worse...

499
00:32:34,371 --> 00:32:37,833
and she was on
life support all day, and...

500
00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:43,380
I don't understand.

501
00:32:43,463 --> 00:32:45,799
It was God's will, Justine.

502
00:32:45,924 --> 00:32:48,927
No one can understand it.
No point trying.

503
00:32:49,052 --> 00:32:51,555
It was just
Gwen's time to...

504
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:54,099
fy away home.

505
00:32:55,934 --> 00:32:58,228
Gwen died today.

506
00:32:58,312 --> 00:33:00,439
What?

507
00:33:01,565 --> 00:33:03,817
Are you kidding?
What for?

508
00:33:04,943 --> 00:33:07,487
Parasite. Bacteria.

509
00:33:07,613 --> 00:33:09,072
Something she ate.

510
00:33:09,156 --> 00:33:10,574
Are you OK?

511
00:33:10,699 --> 00:33:13,911
Where were you
this afternoon?

512
00:33:13,994 --> 00:33:16,747
Painting on Bovary. Why?

513
00:33:16,872 --> 00:33:19,082
What time did Bubba
bring you home?

514
00:33:19,166 --> 00:33:21,793
Knocked off early,
about 4:00.

515
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:24,963
Bubba had a date
with a stewardess. Why?

516
00:33:34,681 --> 00:33:37,851
I can't believe
she's dead.

517
00:33:43,357 --> 00:33:45,609
I wasn't a very good friend
to her.

518
00:33:45,692 --> 00:33:47,653
Aw, don't say that, Teeny.

519
00:33:47,778 --> 00:33:50,489
Of course you were.

520
00:33:50,614 --> 00:33:51,907
Of course you were.

521
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:06,713
Retail Rodeo employees...

522
00:34:06,839 --> 00:34:09,383
this is Jack Field,
your store manager.

523
00:34:09,508 --> 00:34:11,051
Before we open today...

524
00:34:11,176 --> 00:34:14,054
I have some terrible
and shocking news.

525
00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:17,558
One of our best employees,
Gwen Jackson...

526
00:34:17,683 --> 00:34:19,810
died yesterday.

527
00:34:19,893 --> 00:34:24,606
Gwen was a real class act.
She had a good attitude.

528
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:26,608
She had ideas.

529
00:34:26,692 --> 00:34:29,278
And we're all
gonna miss her.

530
00:34:29,361 --> 00:34:31,280
Now, if any of y'all need
to collect your thoughts

531
00:34:31,363 --> 00:34:34,700
and remember Glen... Gwen...

532
00:34:34,825 --> 00:34:38,078
ahem... then today's the day.

533
00:34:38,203 --> 00:34:40,497
You'll be excused from work...

534
00:34:40,581 --> 00:34:43,166
and we'll just have to
do without you.

535
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:46,962
Gwen, this one's for you.

536
00:34:49,381 --> 00:34:55,304
Woman:
~ I'll be seeing you ~

537
00:34:55,387 --> 00:35:02,853
~ In all the old,
familiar places ~

538
00:35:02,978 --> 00:35:07,941
~ That this heart
of mine embraces ~

539
00:35:08,066 --> 00:35:10,736
~ All day through ~

540
00:35:10,736 --> 00:35:12,154
~ All day through ~

541
00:35:16,992 --> 00:35:18,785
Justine:
Holden had the notion

542
00:35:18,911 --> 00:35:20,370
to spend the day
at Gabler's Creek...

543
00:35:20,454 --> 00:35:22,956
skinny-dipping
and making love.

544
00:35:23,081 --> 00:35:25,542
He said
we'd be like Adam and Eve...

545
00:35:25,626 --> 00:35:27,085
rolling
in the sticks and dirt

546
00:35:27,211 --> 00:35:29,338
and being one
with the wilderness.

547
00:35:31,006 --> 00:35:32,716
He was so fixed on the idea

548
00:35:32,841 --> 00:35:35,052
that even when the clouds
were coming in

549
00:35:35,177 --> 00:35:37,888
and the sky
was getting dark...

550
00:35:37,971 --> 00:35:39,932
he kept on swimmin'.

551
00:35:42,601 --> 00:35:45,312
All my thoughts
turned to death.

552
00:35:45,437 --> 00:35:48,524
I thought of Gwen's body
rotting away.

553
00:35:50,108 --> 00:35:53,278
I thought about
what a nice person she was...

554
00:35:53,403 --> 00:35:56,698
so full of life
and goodwill.

555
00:35:56,782 --> 00:36:00,494
If there is a heaven,
Gwen would be there...

556
00:36:00,619 --> 00:36:03,539
giving makeovers
and offering up helpful advice.

557
00:36:05,457 --> 00:36:09,253
I thought if I died today,
what would happen to me...

558
00:36:09,378 --> 00:36:11,755
a hateful girl...

559
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:14,299
a selfish girl?

560
00:36:15,676 --> 00:36:18,804
An adulteress.

561
00:36:18,929 --> 00:36:20,347
A liar.

562
00:36:25,227 --> 00:36:26,687
Oh.

563
00:36:41,118 --> 00:36:42,870
What are we doing?

564
00:36:42,995 --> 00:36:45,455
Making one out of two.

565
00:36:48,333 --> 00:36:51,003
I haven't thought
this through.

566
00:36:51,128 --> 00:36:53,589
Justine...

567
00:36:53,672 --> 00:36:55,424
you leave him.

568
00:36:57,926 --> 00:36:59,970
And go where?

569
00:37:01,889 --> 00:37:03,849
With you on my arm...

570
00:37:03,974 --> 00:37:06,727
my folks would think
I've changed...

571
00:37:06,852 --> 00:37:10,189
and they'd stop thinking
I'm such a loner.

572
00:37:10,314 --> 00:37:12,316
I have a girlfriend,
a pretty one...

573
00:37:12,441 --> 00:37:15,611
who knows me and likes me,
and they'd be so happy

574
00:37:15,694 --> 00:37:19,239
they'd give me money
to write my novel.

575
00:37:19,364 --> 00:37:22,242
But where will we go?

576
00:37:22,367 --> 00:37:24,161
It'll be like...

577
00:37:24,244 --> 00:37:26,538
Catcher in the Rye...

578
00:37:26,663 --> 00:37:29,041
but by me.

579
00:37:29,166 --> 00:37:31,752
I'll be immortal, and then,
likeJ.D. Salinger...

580
00:37:31,877 --> 00:37:33,212
I'll just vanish.

581
00:37:35,088 --> 00:37:37,549
- Hey, Teeny.

582
00:37:37,674 --> 00:37:39,801
We been up to no good.

583
00:37:39,885 --> 00:37:44,473
Got the day off
on account of the rain.

584
00:37:44,556 --> 00:37:47,184
I thought you might.

585
00:37:49,061 --> 00:37:50,979
Man On TV:
What are you doing?

586
00:37:53,357 --> 00:37:56,610
Say, I heard about your friend
being dead and all.

587
00:37:56,735 --> 00:37:58,612
I'm sorry.

588
00:37:58,737 --> 00:38:02,616
Yeah, she was
real healthy, too.

589
00:38:02,741 --> 00:38:07,037
Well, at least you were
with her when she went.

590
00:38:09,748 --> 00:38:14,711
Isn't that right? You were
with her when she went.

591
00:38:15,838 --> 00:38:17,548
Yeah.

592
00:38:17,631 --> 00:38:20,551
I wish it would rain
every day from here on out.

593
00:38:20,634 --> 00:38:23,178
Never have to paint again.

594
00:38:40,612 --> 00:38:42,447
Now, you have to make sure
you order the right ones

595
00:38:42,573 --> 00:38:43,448
when you run out.

596
00:38:43,574 --> 00:38:45,450
- Hey, Justine.
- Hi.

597
00:38:45,576 --> 00:38:46,952
How you holding up?

598
00:38:47,035 --> 00:38:48,036
Fine.

599
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:50,038
Real shocker.

600
00:38:51,331 --> 00:38:54,001
I decided to move Cheryl
over to cosmetics.

601
00:38:54,126 --> 00:38:55,919
She got a little
too creative on the P.A.

602
00:38:56,003 --> 00:38:57,796
Maybe she'll watch
her Ps and Qs over here.

603
00:38:57,921 --> 00:38:59,590
If she don't,
she's out on her butt.

604
00:38:59,715 --> 00:39:01,967
Now you listen
toJustine, sister.

605
00:39:06,972 --> 00:39:09,766
Do you want me to help you
get stuff out of storage?

606
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:11,435
Oh...

607
00:39:11,518 --> 00:39:13,604
no. Maybe later?

608
00:39:13,729 --> 00:39:16,148
All right. Well, are you going
to give me a ride home today?

609
00:39:16,273 --> 00:39:18,942
My ankle sure is acting up.

610
00:39:19,026 --> 00:39:21,862
I got to get home.
But maybe Cheryl can.

611
00:39:21,987 --> 00:39:24,239
What?
You need a ride?

612
00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:27,618
Forget it.

613
00:39:27,701 --> 00:39:29,912
I think we got
to take a breather.

614
00:39:29,995 --> 00:39:33,290
I'm nervous.
I feel guilty.

615
00:39:33,373 --> 00:39:35,334
Well, can't we go
to the motel?

616
00:39:35,417 --> 00:39:36,835
Not today.

617
00:39:36,919 --> 00:39:40,797
Well, let's go
to the storeroom.

618
00:39:40,881 --> 00:39:43,634
Just be patient, Holden.

619
00:39:49,723 --> 00:39:51,767
Um, I was wondering

620
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:54,645
what time was that,
uh, Bible study?

621
00:39:54,728 --> 00:39:56,813
It's tomorrow night
at 8:00.

622
00:39:56,939 --> 00:39:59,066
We'd sure
love to have you.

623
00:39:59,191 --> 00:40:00,734
Can I bring my husband?

624
00:40:00,859 --> 00:40:03,028
Of course.

625
00:40:03,153 --> 00:40:05,697
You know, the couple that
prays together stays together.

626
00:40:28,011 --> 00:40:29,471
What's this?

627
00:40:29,555 --> 00:40:31,014
The Holy Bible.

628
00:40:31,098 --> 00:40:34,768
There's one for you
and one for me.

629
00:40:34,893 --> 00:40:37,354
Not very light, is it?

630
00:40:37,437 --> 00:40:40,148
We're going
to Bible study.

631
00:40:40,232 --> 00:40:42,025
The couple
that prays together

632
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:44,361
stays together.

633
00:40:44,486 --> 00:40:45,529
I heard it was

634
00:40:45,612 --> 00:40:48,866
the couple that lays together
stays together.

635
00:40:48,949 --> 00:40:51,535
Well, you heard wrong.

636
00:40:54,997 --> 00:40:56,123
Cheryl...

637
00:40:56,248 --> 00:40:58,125
do you think you could
take this one?

638
00:40:58,250 --> 00:40:59,751
Sure.

639
00:40:59,877 --> 00:41:01,420
Sit right down here, ma'am.

640
00:41:01,545 --> 00:41:03,297
We're going
to make you pretty.

641
00:41:03,422 --> 00:41:05,048
Now how do you
like your hair?

642
00:41:05,174 --> 00:41:06,925
What? Are you going
to do my hair?

643
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:08,218
No, I just need to know

644
00:41:08,302 --> 00:41:09,761
if that's your usual way
of wearing it...

645
00:41:09,845 --> 00:41:10,888
all big and high.

646
00:41:11,054 --> 00:41:12,347
If it is,
I'll just put more makeup

647
00:41:12,431 --> 00:41:14,141
on your chin
to offset it.

648
00:41:14,266 --> 00:41:15,726
You're going
to want to take

649
00:41:15,851 --> 00:41:17,394
a whole bottle
of this home with you.

650
00:41:17,519 --> 00:41:19,229
It's got quite a lot
of ingredients in it...

651
00:41:19,354 --> 00:41:20,772
so you're getting
a good deal.

652
00:41:20,856 --> 00:41:22,065
It's got
ginkgo extract in it.

653
00:41:22,191 --> 00:41:23,400
Do you know what that is?

654
00:41:23,525 --> 00:41:24,443
No.

655
00:41:24,526 --> 00:41:26,236
It's extract
of the ginkgo...

656
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,654
and it makes
your skin real slick

657
00:41:27,779 --> 00:41:30,073
so that any liquid
will roll right off you...

658
00:41:30,199 --> 00:41:33,118
be it water,
or lemon juice, or urine.

659
00:41:33,243 --> 00:41:35,120
I'll put it
in a bag for you.

660
00:41:39,374 --> 00:41:40,292
Phil...

661
00:41:40,375 --> 00:41:41,502
what are you doing?

662
00:41:41,502 --> 00:41:43,086
what are you doing?

663
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:45,005
What?

664
00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:47,090
We're going to be late
for Bible study.

665
00:41:47,174 --> 00:41:49,134
You're stoned.
You got paint in your hair.

666
00:41:49,218 --> 00:41:51,053
Would you get in
the shower, dummy?

667
00:41:51,136 --> 00:41:52,930
I completely
didn't remember.

668
00:41:53,013 --> 00:41:55,933
Ohh, get in the shower.

669
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:04,316
Working on
your spiritual life?

670
00:42:07,986 --> 00:42:09,696
Yeah, I guess.

671
00:42:09,821 --> 00:42:11,823
Ain't that
a hoot and a holler?

672
00:42:14,117 --> 00:42:15,619
What do you mean?

673
00:42:17,329 --> 00:42:19,164
I saw you, Justine.

674
00:42:21,041 --> 00:42:22,626
You saw me what?

675
00:42:22,751 --> 00:42:25,963
I saw you.

676
00:42:28,215 --> 00:42:30,175
We got some things
to talk about...

677
00:42:30,259 --> 00:42:31,677
you and me.

678
00:42:34,930 --> 00:42:38,392
You come by my house
tomorrow after work...

679
00:42:40,018 --> 00:42:42,145
if you know
what's good for you.

680
00:43:00,205 --> 00:43:01,665
Hey...

681
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:03,125
where's Bubba?

682
00:43:05,210 --> 00:43:06,545
He left.

683
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:08,839
Well, I'm ready.
Let's go.

684
00:43:21,143 --> 00:43:24,104
I don't know what
to say aboutJesus.

685
00:43:24,229 --> 00:43:25,981
I'm stoned.

686
00:43:26,064 --> 00:43:29,234
Just let the other people
do the talking.

687
00:43:30,569 --> 00:43:31,445
Oh, geez...

688
00:43:31,570 --> 00:43:33,864
we forgot
the Bibles, Justine.

689
00:43:33,947 --> 00:43:36,491
Well, that's all right,
they'll forgive us.

690
00:43:37,743 --> 00:43:39,953
Howdy. Welcome.

691
00:43:40,078 --> 00:43:41,747
Hey there, people.

692
00:43:41,872 --> 00:43:43,332
Glad you could make it.

693
00:43:43,457 --> 00:43:44,541
Hi, Corny.

694
00:43:44,625 --> 00:43:45,542
This is my husband...

695
00:43:45,626 --> 00:43:46,543
Phil.

696
00:43:46,627 --> 00:43:47,544
Howdy, Phil.

697
00:43:47,628 --> 00:43:49,296
Y'all are in for a treat.

698
00:43:49,421 --> 00:43:51,632
We got a good discussion
planned for tonight.

699
00:43:51,757 --> 00:43:53,217
If man is made
in God's image...

700
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:56,178
what does that
say about God?

701
00:43:56,261 --> 00:43:58,764
Yeah, that sounds
like a good one, man.

702
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:00,933
Hey, Brandon,
I want to talk to you

703
00:44:01,058 --> 00:44:03,227
about the casting of
Pilgrim's Progress.

704
00:44:12,277 --> 00:44:13,153
Phil, come
with me to the car.

705
00:44:13,278 --> 00:44:14,321
What?

706
00:44:14,446 --> 00:44:16,782
Come with me to the car.
I got to get something.

707
00:44:21,662 --> 00:44:22,579
What are you doing?

708
00:44:22,663 --> 00:44:23,789
Get in the car.

709
00:44:23,914 --> 00:44:25,832
Just get
in the car, Phil.

710
00:44:29,753 --> 00:44:30,963
What the hell?

711
00:44:31,088 --> 00:44:32,965
I don't want
to go to Bible study.

712
00:44:33,090 --> 00:44:34,174
Why not?

713
00:44:34,299 --> 00:44:35,759
Because I don't want to.

714
00:44:35,884 --> 00:44:38,095
Now let's just
get out of here.

715
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:40,305
Justine,
this is embarrassing.

716
00:44:40,430 --> 00:44:41,807
We're running away
from Bible study

717
00:44:41,932 --> 00:44:43,600
like a couple of
devil worshipers.

718
00:44:43,684 --> 00:44:46,270
I don't care.
I'm not in the mood.

719
00:44:46,353 --> 00:44:49,273
You are
freaking me out, man.

720
00:44:49,356 --> 00:44:50,649
Why?

721
00:44:50,774 --> 00:44:52,276
Why?

722
00:44:52,401 --> 00:44:56,113
Because we forgot
our Bibles is why.

723
00:44:56,196 --> 00:44:57,406
You just said 2 seconds ago

724
00:44:57,489 --> 00:44:59,783
they'd forgive us.

725
00:44:59,908 --> 00:45:01,910
Well, they may not,
all right?

726
00:45:01,994 --> 00:45:04,788
So can we please just
get the shit out of here?

727
00:45:04,872 --> 00:45:05,873
All right.

728
00:45:05,998 --> 00:45:07,708
I'm never going back
to Bible study again.

729
00:45:07,833 --> 00:45:09,209
I can tell you that much.

730
00:45:09,334 --> 00:45:11,628
I don't care.
Fine by me. Let's just go.

731
00:45:19,553 --> 00:45:22,139
Woman: I look too white,
don't you think?

732
00:45:22,222 --> 00:45:24,725
Not at all. I'm just trying
to match your face with your hair.

733
00:45:24,850 --> 00:45:26,727
I was thinking
you're not white enough.

734
00:45:26,852 --> 00:45:29,188
I think I look
kind of weird.

735
00:45:29,313 --> 00:45:31,190
The first rule of fashion

736
00:45:31,315 --> 00:45:32,858
is you have to look weird.

737
00:45:32,983 --> 00:45:35,444
What I'm doing has come
straight here from France.

738
00:45:35,569 --> 00:45:36,653
Oh?

739
00:45:36,737 --> 00:45:38,071
It's called Cirque du Face...

740
00:45:38,197 --> 00:45:39,656
meaning
"Circus of the Face,"

741
00:45:39,781 --> 00:45:41,992
and it's all the rage
with the Frenchies, ma'am.

742
00:45:42,075 --> 00:45:44,036
Well, you're
the professional.

743
00:45:44,119 --> 00:45:45,120
That's right...

744
00:45:45,204 --> 00:45:47,122
and you're in good hands.

745
00:45:48,332 --> 00:45:50,751
Corny: Justine,
what happened to you?

746
00:45:50,876 --> 00:45:52,586
I looked over,
and I saw you two driving off

747
00:45:52,711 --> 00:45:53,754
like vampires in the night.

748
00:45:53,879 --> 00:45:55,088
Oh, gee...

749
00:45:55,214 --> 00:45:57,341
we... we forgot our Bibles.

750
00:45:57,466 --> 00:45:59,259
Well, you could have just
looked on with your neighbor.

751
00:45:59,384 --> 00:46:00,594
It's a church, you know.

752
00:46:00,719 --> 00:46:03,347
You can't make water without
bumping your nut on a Bible.

753
00:46:03,472 --> 00:46:06,141
Well, we felt bad.

754
00:46:07,726 --> 00:46:10,270
What in blazes?

755
00:46:10,395 --> 00:46:12,689
Do you like it?

756
00:46:12,773 --> 00:46:15,567
I can't go.

757
00:46:15,817 --> 00:46:16,693
What?

758
00:46:16,818 --> 00:46:18,529
I can't go today.

759
00:46:18,612 --> 00:46:19,530
There's something important

760
00:46:19,613 --> 00:46:21,365
that I have to tend to.

761
00:46:21,490 --> 00:46:23,867
I thought you said
we'd go today.

762
00:46:23,951 --> 00:46:26,703
Yeah, something came up.

763
00:46:26,787 --> 00:46:30,040
Well, what?
What came up?

764
00:46:30,165 --> 00:46:32,584
OK, look, uh...

765
00:46:32,709 --> 00:46:34,878
I think, um, maybe...

766
00:46:34,962 --> 00:46:37,506
somebody has found out about us.

767
00:46:41,009 --> 00:46:44,429
Well, I'm starting to wonder
if you even want to go.

768
00:46:46,014 --> 00:46:48,350
I'm starting to think
you don't get me.

769
00:46:53,814 --> 00:46:56,817
Maybe I don't get you.

770
00:47:05,450 --> 00:47:06,410
You do! You do get me!

771
00:47:06,535 --> 00:47:07,578
You just don't
want to get me...

772
00:47:07,661 --> 00:47:09,705
because I'm
too intensified for you.

773
00:47:09,788 --> 00:47:11,582
Justine, who cares...

774
00:47:11,665 --> 00:47:13,125
Who cares
if someone found out?

775
00:47:13,208 --> 00:47:15,210
Look, we don't have to
live like this, Justine.

776
00:47:15,294 --> 00:47:17,421
I know what it's like
to go home every night

777
00:47:17,504 --> 00:47:19,006
and feel like
you're hiding out.

778
00:47:19,131 --> 00:47:20,549
We can leave
all this behind.

779
00:47:20,632 --> 00:47:22,009
That's easy for you
to say, Holden.

780
00:47:22,134 --> 00:47:23,302
You are not married.

781
00:47:23,427 --> 00:47:24,761
Are you just
going to give up?

782
00:47:24,887 --> 00:47:25,846
You going to go
crawling back?

783
00:47:25,971 --> 00:47:27,848
Holden, you are going
to get us caught!

784
00:47:27,973 --> 00:47:29,183
You're so
fucking frightened...

785
00:47:29,308 --> 00:47:30,434
it makes me sick.

786
00:47:32,186 --> 00:47:33,270
Wait...

787
00:47:33,395 --> 00:47:36,607
don't give up on us.

788
00:47:36,690 --> 00:47:38,567
I won't.

789
00:47:44,781 --> 00:47:47,326
OK.

790
00:47:50,537 --> 00:47:51,622
OK.

791
00:48:00,047 --> 00:48:02,799
I'll see you
tomorrow, OK?

792
00:48:04,468 --> 00:48:06,136
OK?

793
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:07,387
OK.

794
00:48:07,513 --> 00:48:10,224
Good luck on
your important thing.

795
00:48:10,349 --> 00:48:12,518
Thanks.

796
00:48:32,037 --> 00:48:34,206
Easy, Bits. Easy, Bits.

797
00:48:34,331 --> 00:48:36,375
Back in your corner!
Back in your corner!

798
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:38,710
Back in your corner, Bits!

799
00:48:40,504 --> 00:48:41,797
Come on in.

800
00:48:44,091 --> 00:48:46,343
I want
to show you something.

801
00:48:47,886 --> 00:48:48,762
Sit.

802
00:48:50,681 --> 00:48:51,682
You get in your corner!

803
00:48:51,807 --> 00:48:53,058
Get in your corner!

804
00:48:53,183 --> 00:48:54,142
I mean it!
In your corner!

805
00:48:54,226 --> 00:48:56,270
In your corner!

806
00:49:07,573 --> 00:49:10,033
I'm in shock.

807
00:49:15,414 --> 00:49:17,291
Why?

808
00:49:17,416 --> 00:49:19,793
You know why.

809
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:24,089
Justine:
Bubba sat like that

810
00:49:24,214 --> 00:49:27,968
for what seemed like 1 0 years
before he began to speak.

811
00:49:28,093 --> 00:49:29,887
Finally,
when he opened his mouth...

812
00:49:29,970 --> 00:49:31,013
he talked a blue streak

813
00:49:31,096 --> 00:49:34,391
about the sad ruin
that was his life.

814
00:49:34,516 --> 00:49:36,393
He talked about
how he loved Phil...

815
00:49:36,476 --> 00:49:37,769
and how he loved me...

816
00:49:37,895 --> 00:49:40,439
and how he always wanted
a girlfriend just like me

817
00:49:40,564 --> 00:49:41,148
and to be a guy like Phil

818
00:49:41,148 --> 00:49:42,065
and to be a guy like Phil

819
00:49:42,149 --> 00:49:46,653
to this imaginary girl
like me who he never found.

820
00:49:46,778 --> 00:49:49,323
Then he started on about
giving up your dreams

821
00:49:49,448 --> 00:49:51,867
and how it's all a part
of getting older.

822
00:49:51,950 --> 00:49:55,287
Bubba had given up
his dream of being Phil.

823
00:49:55,412 --> 00:49:58,457
He had accepted his fate
of being Bubba...

824
00:49:58,582 --> 00:50:00,918
always and forever.

825
00:50:01,001 --> 00:50:02,628
Then last week...

826
00:50:02,753 --> 00:50:04,338
a door that had
always been shut

827
00:50:04,463 --> 00:50:06,590
swung wide open.

828
00:50:15,766 --> 00:50:18,977
Bubba felt that this
was no chance coincidence.

829
00:50:19,102 --> 00:50:22,856
A cosmic force was at work.

830
00:50:22,981 --> 00:50:25,442
The sounds of me making love
to a man who wasn't Phil

831
00:50:25,526 --> 00:50:27,194
was like
a shout in Bubba's ear

832
00:50:27,319 --> 00:50:29,363
from the Creator himself.

833
00:50:36,995 --> 00:50:38,956
What it meant,
or what to do or why...

834
00:50:39,081 --> 00:50:40,958
Bubba didn't know.

835
00:50:41,041 --> 00:50:42,709
All he knew
was that he hated me

836
00:50:42,835 --> 00:50:44,628
for poisoning
the well of idealism

837
00:50:44,753 --> 00:50:47,130
from which he had drunk
for so long.

838
00:50:47,214 --> 00:50:51,009
I was no longer Bubba's image
of perfection.

839
00:50:51,134 --> 00:50:53,762
I was just
a liar and a whore...

840
00:50:53,846 --> 00:50:57,349
and that sickened him.

841
00:50:57,474 --> 00:50:58,517
But on the other hand...

842
00:50:58,642 --> 00:51:00,352
he loved me
for opening his eyes

843
00:51:00,477 --> 00:51:02,729
and releasing him from
the bitter chains of envy

844
00:51:02,855 --> 00:51:05,732
that bound him to Phil.

845
00:51:05,858 --> 00:51:07,067
Phil was no Superman...

846
00:51:07,192 --> 00:51:09,111
just a cuckold and a fool...

847
00:51:09,194 --> 00:51:11,363
and that was beautiful.

848
00:51:15,576 --> 00:51:16,535
Bubba felt that there was

849
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:18,787
just one thing
left for us to do...

850
00:51:18,871 --> 00:51:20,998
something that would
solve both of our problems

851
00:51:21,123 --> 00:51:23,709
and end
this whole tragic saga.

852
00:51:23,834 --> 00:51:26,753
Bubba, I'm not going
to sleep with you.

853
00:51:26,879 --> 00:51:28,755
But don't you see?

854
00:51:28,881 --> 00:51:31,258
This is my chance
for liberation.

855
00:51:31,383 --> 00:51:33,260
But one person's...

856
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:34,636
But one person's...

857
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:36,346
you know, liberation...

858
00:51:36,430 --> 00:51:38,724
is another person's badness.

859
00:51:38,849 --> 00:51:40,184
There's just no way.

860
00:51:40,267 --> 00:51:41,852
I'm going to have
to tell Phil then.

861
00:51:41,977 --> 00:51:42,936
Why?

862
00:51:43,061 --> 00:51:44,730
He's my best friend.

863
00:51:44,855 --> 00:51:46,148
I can't
keep him in the dark

864
00:51:46,231 --> 00:51:47,816
about something this big.

865
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:49,193
He's a cuckold.

866
00:51:49,276 --> 00:51:51,195
But you want
to cuckold him yourself.

867
00:51:51,278 --> 00:51:53,614
That's different.
That's not about him.

868
00:51:53,739 --> 00:51:57,201
That's about my salvation.

869
00:51:57,326 --> 00:52:00,370
Look, you've got
your choice to make...

870
00:52:00,454 --> 00:52:02,080
Destroy your marriage

871
00:52:02,206 --> 00:52:04,208
and break
your husband's heart...

872
00:52:04,333 --> 00:52:06,835
or have sex with me
right now.

873
00:52:13,091 --> 00:52:14,051
In your corner, Bits!

874
00:52:14,176 --> 00:52:16,386
Down! In your corner!

875
00:52:21,433 --> 00:52:25,854
Justine! Justine! Justine!

876
00:52:38,283 --> 00:52:39,826
Oh! God!

877
00:52:39,952 --> 00:52:41,495
What?

878
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:42,496
There was someone
at that window.

879
00:52:42,621 --> 00:52:43,497
Did you not see?

880
00:52:43,622 --> 00:52:46,458
Oh, you're paranoid.

881
00:52:46,583 --> 00:52:47,960
I got to go.

882
00:52:49,253 --> 00:52:50,712
Phil is never
going to find out

883
00:52:50,796 --> 00:52:52,422
about any of this.

884
00:52:52,506 --> 00:52:54,091
Don't fret.

885
00:52:54,216 --> 00:52:56,093
Just get this damn dog
away from me.

886
00:52:57,219 --> 00:52:59,304
You're looking at
a free man, Justine.

887
00:52:59,429 --> 00:53:00,389
A free man.

888
00:53:00,472 --> 00:53:01,640
Great. Good for you.

889
00:53:01,765 --> 00:53:02,766
Thank you.

890
00:53:04,393 --> 00:53:05,269
Bits!

891
00:53:06,979 --> 00:53:09,106
Bits! Bits!

892
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:11,358
TV: . . The children.

893
00:53:11,483 --> 00:53:13,735
All the tales
of mystical places

894
00:53:13,819 --> 00:53:16,113
began with
"once upon a time..."

895
00:53:17,906 --> 00:53:19,324
I'm nervous.

896
00:53:21,451 --> 00:53:23,954
You're nervous? Why?

897
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:26,665
Because I got to go
to that doctor tomorrow

898
00:53:26,790 --> 00:53:29,501
and jism into a cup,
that's why.

899
00:53:29,626 --> 00:53:31,920
What if I can't do it?

900
00:53:32,004 --> 00:53:33,255
You can do it.

901
00:53:33,338 --> 00:53:35,257
You know, if you
said you'd help me...

902
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:38,010
I'd feel
a lot less nervous.

903
00:53:39,887 --> 00:53:43,307
It's going to be on
your lunch hour anyway.

904
00:53:46,018 --> 00:53:48,395
OK.

905
00:53:49,688 --> 00:53:51,148
You didn't even
say nothing

906
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:53,650
about the TV
being fixed.

907
00:53:53,775 --> 00:53:56,653
Oh. Is it?

908
00:54:00,324 --> 00:54:02,075
Thanks.

909
00:54:02,201 --> 00:54:05,662
You're welcome.

910
00:54:08,165 --> 00:54:10,709
Well, aren't you
a fright?

911
00:54:10,834 --> 00:54:13,170
Justine, have you
heard from Holden?

912
00:54:13,253 --> 00:54:14,171
He didn't show up
for work today.

913
00:54:14,254 --> 00:54:15,172
I want to know
what gives.

914
00:54:15,255 --> 00:54:16,757
I know you two
are friends.

915
00:54:16,882 --> 00:54:18,050
We're not friends.

916
00:54:18,175 --> 00:54:21,553
You eat lunch
together every day.

917
00:54:21,678 --> 00:54:23,347
No, we don't.

918
00:54:24,848 --> 00:54:26,183
Well, if you see him...

919
00:54:26,266 --> 00:54:27,976
tell him Jack Field's
looking for him.

920
00:54:39,905 --> 00:54:40,864
Oh, my God!

921
00:54:42,366 --> 00:54:43,283
What are you doing?

922
00:54:43,408 --> 00:54:44,576
You're a hooker.

923
00:54:44,701 --> 00:54:45,577
You hooker!

924
00:54:45,702 --> 00:54:47,079
I saw you.
You followed me.

925
00:54:47,204 --> 00:54:48,580
So how many guys
you gettin' with?

926
00:54:48,705 --> 00:54:50,374
You gettin' with
every guy in the state?

927
00:54:50,499 --> 00:54:53,210
No! Holden, this is
all because of you!

928
00:54:53,293 --> 00:54:54,920
He had me
over a barrel.

929
00:54:55,045 --> 00:54:55,921
If I didn't
sleep with him...

930
00:54:56,046 --> 00:54:57,297
he was going to tell
Phil about us.

931
00:54:57,422 --> 00:54:59,716
I'm so alone!

932
00:54:59,842 --> 00:55:01,844
You've got
to get ahold of yourself.

933
00:55:01,969 --> 00:55:04,471
Oh!

934
00:55:04,596 --> 00:55:05,514
Are you drunk?

935
00:55:05,597 --> 00:55:06,932
Yes, I'm drunk!

936
00:55:07,057 --> 00:55:08,684
And I'll be drunk every day
until the day I die!

937
00:55:08,767 --> 00:55:09,935
What do you care?

938
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:12,521
You'll jump on any pecker
that's put in front of you!

939
00:55:12,646 --> 00:55:14,523
It's not
what you think.

940
00:55:14,606 --> 00:55:16,358
I saw everything!

941
00:55:16,441 --> 00:55:18,777
Oh, God! Oh, my God!

942
00:55:18,902 --> 00:55:20,904
OK, go home, sober up...

943
00:55:21,029 --> 00:55:21,905
meet me after work...

944
00:55:22,030 --> 00:55:23,240
and we will
talk about this.

945
00:55:23,365 --> 00:55:24,575
Where are you going?

946
00:55:24,658 --> 00:55:26,660
I got to help Phil
with his sperm.

947
00:55:26,785 --> 00:55:27,744
What?

948
00:55:27,828 --> 00:55:28,912
Just go!

949
00:55:29,037 --> 00:55:30,122
- Go on!
- Wait.

950
00:55:30,247 --> 00:55:32,457
I can't share you, Justine!

951
00:55:32,583 --> 00:55:33,458
Maybe with one man...

952
00:55:33,584 --> 00:55:35,419
but not with
a whole bunch of them!

953
00:55:39,381 --> 00:55:40,966
Oh, great.

954
00:55:48,599 --> 00:55:50,684
Nurse: Mr. Last,
would you come with me?

955
00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:54,271
Wish me luck.

956
00:55:54,396 --> 00:55:55,272
Good luck, honey.

957
00:55:55,397 --> 00:55:56,481
Knock 'em dead, partner.

958
00:56:07,159 --> 00:56:08,452
You look nice.

959
00:56:08,535 --> 00:56:10,370
No, I don't.

960
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:12,873
I know you're angry,
and I can figure why...

961
00:56:12,998 --> 00:56:15,375
but from where I stand...

962
00:56:15,501 --> 00:56:17,878
what happened yesterday
was a wonderful thing.

963
00:56:18,003 --> 00:56:20,964
Nothing happened yesterday,
so drop it.

964
00:56:24,009 --> 00:56:26,220
Well, I'm awful grateful
to you, Justine. I am.

965
00:56:26,345 --> 00:56:29,306
Bubba, I mean it.

966
00:56:36,980 --> 00:56:41,818
Let me just
ask you one thing.

967
00:56:41,902 --> 00:56:44,238
How do I stack up
against Phil...

968
00:56:44,363 --> 00:56:45,906
you know?

969
00:56:46,031 --> 00:56:48,575
How do I stack up
against him where it counts?

970
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:50,244
Ma'am?

971
00:56:50,369 --> 00:56:53,288
Your husband has made
a request for your presence.

972
00:56:56,375 --> 00:56:58,168
Who's that?

973
00:56:58,293 --> 00:56:59,920
It's Justine.

974
00:57:02,464 --> 00:57:04,758
Come on.

975
00:57:08,804 --> 00:57:10,848
I can't do this on my own.

976
00:57:10,973 --> 00:57:12,683
I need help.

977
00:57:12,808 --> 00:57:15,686
What? You've never
done it on your own?

978
00:57:15,811 --> 00:57:18,021
Not in a place like this.

979
00:57:18,146 --> 00:57:22,192
Not when I have to
hand over the results.

980
00:57:22,317 --> 00:57:24,695
Just...

981
00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:27,865
let me hold your boob.

982
00:57:27,990 --> 00:57:30,242
Here.

983
00:57:31,743 --> 00:57:34,371
Ow! They're sore.

984
00:57:52,181 --> 00:57:55,058
What's wrong with you?
You look like death.

985
00:57:55,142 --> 00:57:59,104
My stomach's cramping.

986
00:57:59,188 --> 00:58:01,190
I feel sore.

987
00:58:01,315 --> 00:58:02,232
Is it your period?

988
00:58:02,316 --> 00:58:03,901
No, it's just stress.

989
00:58:03,984 --> 00:58:06,236
I know,
this job's stressful.

990
00:58:06,361 --> 00:58:08,280
I'm breaking out.

991
00:58:08,405 --> 00:58:09,615
You're breaking out

992
00:58:09,740 --> 00:58:11,825
because you put so much makeup
on your face.

993
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:14,912
Maybe you're pregnant.

994
00:58:14,995 --> 00:58:16,413
What?

995
00:58:16,496 --> 00:58:17,915
No.

996
00:58:34,014 --> 00:58:36,808
You know, sometimes
I think to myself...

997
00:58:36,934 --> 00:58:38,644
"At least it can't
get any worse."

998
00:58:38,769 --> 00:58:40,646
But it can.

999
00:58:40,771 --> 00:58:42,147
It could get worse.

1000
00:58:42,272 --> 00:58:44,233
As long as you can say
you hit rock bottom...

1001
00:58:44,358 --> 00:58:45,817
you haven't.

1002
00:58:47,152 --> 00:58:49,446
Oh, my God...

1003
00:58:49,530 --> 00:58:50,447
blackberries.

1004
00:58:50,531 --> 00:58:52,574
A blind man could go deaf...

1005
00:58:52,658 --> 00:58:54,159
a widow could
lose her children...

1006
00:58:54,243 --> 00:58:57,454
babies starve
and they never get food.

1007
00:58:59,581 --> 00:59:02,084
They never get any food!

1008
00:59:02,209 --> 00:59:05,003
They just come into the world
and they die.

1009
00:59:05,128 --> 00:59:07,297
Holden, calm down,
all right?

1010
00:59:07,381 --> 00:59:09,258
I can't calm down!

1011
00:59:09,341 --> 00:59:10,801
It'd be easy if
I was a hooker like you...

1012
00:59:10,884 --> 00:59:12,636
then I could calm down
all over town.

1013
00:59:12,719 --> 00:59:13,637
Hey!

1014
00:59:14,721 --> 00:59:17,057
I am not a hooker!

1015
00:59:18,183 --> 00:59:21,144
l... I know you're not.

1016
00:59:22,604 --> 00:59:24,648
I'm in agony.

1017
00:59:24,731 --> 00:59:25,899
Why?

1018
00:59:26,024 --> 00:59:27,860
What do you mean why?
I thought you hated your life.

1019
00:59:27,985 --> 00:59:31,405
I do. I mean,
I'm depressed, but...

1020
00:59:32,823 --> 00:59:35,242
but you are
really depressed.

1021
00:59:41,623 --> 00:59:44,543
I'll kill him.
I'll murder him in his sleep.

1022
00:59:44,626 --> 00:59:46,003
I'll kill my parents,
I'll steal their money...

1023
00:59:46,086 --> 00:59:48,005
whatever it takes...
just... just whatever you want.

1024
00:59:48,088 --> 00:59:49,673
Just as long as
it's you and me.

1025
00:59:49,798 --> 00:59:51,008
Please don't
forsake me, Justine.

1026
00:59:53,719 --> 00:59:54,887
OK.

1027
00:59:55,012 --> 00:59:56,054
I can't take it!

1028
00:59:56,180 --> 00:59:57,097
All right, I won't.

1029
00:59:57,222 --> 00:59:58,765
I won't, I promise.

1030
00:59:58,891 --> 01:00:00,184
I won't.

1031
01:00:00,267 --> 01:00:02,436
I promise, OK?

1032
01:00:03,896 --> 01:00:05,647
Justine: I realized then

1033
01:00:05,731 --> 01:00:07,524
that Holden was at best,
a child...

1034
01:00:07,608 --> 01:00:10,652
and at worst, a demon.

1035
01:00:10,736 --> 01:00:12,154
If I was ever
going to go straight...

1036
01:00:12,237 --> 01:00:14,156
I'd have to ditch him.

1037
01:00:14,239 --> 01:00:17,075
Sometimes to get back
on the road to redemption...

1038
01:00:17,201 --> 01:00:19,995
you have to make
a few pit stops.

1039
01:00:20,078 --> 01:00:21,413
How much are
the blackberries?

1040
01:00:21,538 --> 01:00:24,208
Ah, a tin for $2.00, miss.

1041
01:00:25,792 --> 01:00:27,586
Here you go.

1042
01:00:27,711 --> 01:00:28,670
Thank you.

1043
01:00:30,756 --> 01:00:32,633
Have a blackberry.

1044
01:00:35,844 --> 01:00:37,888
We... We need a plan.

1045
01:00:37,971 --> 01:00:39,598
We can't keep
living day-to-day.

1046
01:00:39,723 --> 01:00:41,642
We got to chart a course,
and we just got to stick...

1047
01:00:41,767 --> 01:00:44,186
Have a blackberry,
Holden!

1048
01:00:44,269 --> 01:00:45,896
They're... They're dirty.

1049
01:00:58,617 --> 01:01:00,619
They're sweet.

1050
01:01:06,875 --> 01:01:10,087
If I could only get
my hands on some money.

1051
01:01:10,170 --> 01:01:12,756
If someone could just
tell me the answer.

1052
01:01:16,260 --> 01:01:17,761
I got to do...

1053
01:01:17,886 --> 01:01:19,137
But I never do anything...

1054
01:01:19,263 --> 01:01:21,598
'cause I end up
thinking about it instead.

1055
01:01:21,682 --> 01:01:24,184
I got to do.

1056
01:01:25,811 --> 01:01:27,396
But do what...

1057
01:01:27,479 --> 01:01:29,273
Whoa. What?

1058
01:01:35,237 --> 01:01:36,989
What was that for?

1059
01:01:37,114 --> 01:01:38,240
They looked dirty.

1060
01:01:38,323 --> 01:01:41,118
They... like... I saw a bug
in them or something.

1061
01:01:59,678 --> 01:02:00,929
Son, I understood
your history.

1062
01:02:01,013 --> 01:02:03,515
Your father gave me a call,
I gave you a job.

1063
01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:04,933
I even let you
use that name...

1064
01:02:05,017 --> 01:02:05,934
even though
it isn't yours...

1065
01:02:06,018 --> 01:02:06,977
and I never do that

1066
01:02:07,060 --> 01:02:08,937
with other people
in the store, so...

1067
01:02:17,196 --> 01:02:20,574
I'm worried
about Holden... Tom.

1068
01:02:20,699 --> 01:02:23,493
I'm... I'm
worried about Tom.

1069
01:02:23,619 --> 01:02:27,581
I just befriended
Tom recently...

1070
01:02:27,706 --> 01:02:31,001
and now...

1071
01:02:31,126 --> 01:02:33,337
well...

1072
01:02:33,462 --> 01:02:36,465
I think
he's mentally ill.

1073
01:02:36,590 --> 01:02:38,717
He's got this idea
in his head

1074
01:02:38,842 --> 01:02:41,011
that we've had
some sort of affair...

1075
01:02:41,136 --> 01:02:42,513
which is crazy...

1076
01:02:42,596 --> 01:02:44,223
because
I'm... I'm married...

1077
01:02:44,348 --> 01:02:45,682
And... And he said...

1078
01:02:45,807 --> 01:02:48,018
He's been saying
all sorts of strange things

1079
01:02:48,143 --> 01:02:50,604
and making threats...

1080
01:02:50,729 --> 01:02:53,440
and drinkin'...

1081
01:02:53,565 --> 01:02:54,525
and...

1082
01:02:59,029 --> 01:03:01,156
and I just think

1083
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:03,700
he would be better off
someplace where people...

1084
01:03:03,784 --> 01:03:05,786
professionals...

1085
01:03:05,911 --> 01:03:08,080
could take care of him.

1086
01:03:08,205 --> 01:03:09,790
Otherwise, l... l... l...

1087
01:03:09,915 --> 01:03:12,543
He's going to get
himself into trouble.

1088
01:03:35,816 --> 01:03:38,569
What are you
doing in there?

1089
01:03:38,652 --> 01:03:40,279
What's that?

1090
01:03:40,404 --> 01:03:43,073
It's a home pregnancy test.

1091
01:03:43,156 --> 01:03:45,158
Why are you taking it?

1092
01:03:45,284 --> 01:03:48,078
Because I still haven't
gotten my period.

1093
01:03:50,163 --> 01:03:51,081
What's it say?

1094
01:03:51,164 --> 01:03:52,583
Well, I haven't
taken it yet.

1095
01:03:52,666 --> 01:03:55,419
Could you give me
a minute, please?

1096
01:03:55,544 --> 01:03:58,422
I want to be here
when you find out, Teeny.

1097
01:04:01,466 --> 01:04:03,051
OK.

1098
01:04:14,438 --> 01:04:17,482
The little plastic
doohickey's turning blue.

1099
01:04:17,608 --> 01:04:19,568
What's that mean?

1100
01:04:19,693 --> 01:04:21,445
Blue?

1101
01:04:21,570 --> 01:04:23,572
Bright blue.

1102
01:04:27,868 --> 01:04:30,454
That means I'm pregnant.

1103
01:04:34,458 --> 01:04:36,293
All right!

1104
01:04:36,418 --> 01:04:37,711
Phil: I knew it.

1105
01:04:37,836 --> 01:04:40,839
Waste of time going
to that sperm doctor.

1106
01:04:40,964 --> 01:04:42,174
We did it!

1107
01:04:42,299 --> 01:04:44,384
We're going to have
ourselves a baby.

1108
01:04:44,510 --> 01:04:47,137
Maybe.

1109
01:04:47,221 --> 01:04:48,138
Tomorrow...

1110
01:04:48,263 --> 01:04:51,183
we're going to celebrate
at Senor Tuna.

1111
01:04:51,308 --> 01:04:52,434
Yes, we are.

1112
01:04:52,518 --> 01:04:53,894
And I'm going
to bring Bubba...

1113
01:04:54,019 --> 01:04:56,605
you can bring some of your
friends from work, or...

1114
01:04:56,688 --> 01:04:58,607
the Bible-study guy...

1115
01:04:58,690 --> 01:04:59,983
whoever.

1116
01:05:01,485 --> 01:05:03,862
Too bad Gwen's dead.

1117
01:05:03,987 --> 01:05:06,156
The test
could be wrong, Phil.

1118
01:05:06,281 --> 01:05:08,325
It's a little early
to be having a party.

1119
01:05:12,538 --> 01:05:14,665
Well, let's do it
mellow then.

1120
01:05:17,251 --> 01:05:19,628
You sure don't
seem too excited.

1121
01:05:19,711 --> 01:05:22,506
Oh, I'm excited.

1122
01:05:22,631 --> 01:05:24,424
It's just...

1123
01:05:24,550 --> 01:05:26,468
you know, a lot of worries
come along with having a baby.

1124
01:05:26,552 --> 01:05:29,847
Now don't think negative.

1125
01:05:29,972 --> 01:05:32,266
Think positive.

1126
01:05:32,391 --> 01:05:36,019
We could have ourselves
a tiny Phil...

1127
01:05:37,229 --> 01:05:39,147
or a tiny Teeny.

1128
01:05:40,732 --> 01:05:44,528
Teeny's going to have
a teeny-weeny Teeny.

1129
01:05:49,449 --> 01:05:50,993
You think anything's
going to change...

1130
01:05:51,076 --> 01:05:52,786
having a baby?

1131
01:05:53,996 --> 01:05:54,872
What do you mean?

1132
01:05:54,997 --> 01:05:57,000
Everything's
going to change.

1133
01:05:59,293 --> 01:06:00,335
Yeah, but I mean...

1134
01:06:00,460 --> 01:06:04,214
do you think anything's
really going to change?

1135
01:06:05,924 --> 01:06:07,426
What do you mean?

1136
01:06:09,219 --> 01:06:10,095
Woman On TV: Gentlemen?

1137
01:06:10,220 --> 01:06:11,722
Man: Morning.

1138
01:06:11,847 --> 01:06:14,808
We found these
out in the road.

1139
01:06:14,933 --> 01:06:18,061
Belonged to a fellow
named of Burt Evans.

1140
01:06:26,278 --> 01:06:28,155
Man: Tell us
about everything.

1141
01:06:31,658 --> 01:06:32,576
Hello?

1142
01:06:32,659 --> 01:06:34,203
Woman: Hi.
This is Dr. Williams

1143
01:06:34,328 --> 01:06:36,622
returning the call
ofJean Worther.

1144
01:06:38,373 --> 01:06:39,750
I'm calling from

1145
01:06:39,875 --> 01:06:42,419
the Halin County
Psychiatric Hospital.

1146
01:06:47,591 --> 01:06:50,052
Who was it, Tom?

1147
01:06:50,135 --> 01:06:52,513
It was a wrong number.

1148
01:07:27,422 --> 01:07:29,258
Either of you
seen Holden?

1149
01:07:30,843 --> 01:07:33,762
That boy
is out on his ass!

1150
01:07:41,436 --> 01:07:44,898
Justine,
something's going on.

1151
01:07:55,158 --> 01:07:57,870
Something is
definitely happening.

1152
01:07:59,496 --> 01:08:00,789
OK, go find out.

1153
01:08:18,515 --> 01:08:20,058
What? What is it?
What's happening?

1154
01:08:20,184 --> 01:08:21,059
It's big.

1155
01:08:21,185 --> 01:08:22,060
What?

1156
01:08:22,186 --> 01:08:23,395
It's very big.

1157
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:25,063
Cheryl, come on.
I'm gonna kill you.

1158
01:08:25,189 --> 01:08:28,108
Somebody stole $1 5,000
from the safe.

1159
01:08:28,233 --> 01:08:31,403
Yeah. They blew the thing
open with a gun.

1160
01:08:31,528 --> 01:08:32,821
Oh, my God.

1161
01:08:32,905 --> 01:08:34,031
Not only that...

1162
01:08:34,114 --> 01:08:35,532
but the cops
know who did it.

1163
01:08:35,616 --> 01:08:36,783
Who?

1164
01:08:36,909 --> 01:08:38,744
Somebody who works here.

1165
01:08:38,869 --> 01:08:40,078
Oh, Cheryl!

1166
01:08:40,204 --> 01:08:41,580
Holden... Holden did it.

1167
01:08:41,705 --> 01:08:44,124
Fool left his cashier key
in the door.

1168
01:08:44,249 --> 01:08:45,417
Oh, my God.

1169
01:08:45,542 --> 01:08:46,752
They can't find him,
though.

1170
01:08:46,877 --> 01:08:48,754
They say he robbed
his folks, too...

1171
01:08:48,879 --> 01:08:50,005
Took off.

1172
01:08:50,088 --> 01:08:52,174
You in on it?

1173
01:08:52,257 --> 01:08:53,383
What?!

1174
01:08:53,467 --> 01:08:54,676
No.

1175
01:08:54,760 --> 01:08:56,803
I know you two played hooky
in the storeroom.

1176
01:08:56,929 --> 01:08:58,096
I'll never rat on you.

1177
01:08:58,222 --> 01:08:59,640
I done some things myself.

1178
01:08:59,765 --> 01:09:01,600
Just tell me...
you in on it?

1179
01:09:01,725 --> 01:09:04,019
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1180
01:09:04,102 --> 01:09:05,646
Suit yourself.

1181
01:09:10,484 --> 01:09:11,527
Justine...

1182
01:09:11,652 --> 01:09:13,904
can we talk to you
for a second?

1183
01:09:24,998 --> 01:09:26,416
Jack: Come in.

1184
01:09:30,295 --> 01:09:31,839
Hi, Justine.

1185
01:09:31,964 --> 01:09:33,799
Go ahead
and have a seat.

1186
01:09:45,686 --> 01:09:48,105
Justine,
you like working

1187
01:09:48,188 --> 01:09:50,440
at the Retail Rodeo,
don't you?

1188
01:09:50,524 --> 01:09:52,067
You like the company...

1189
01:09:52,192 --> 01:09:54,361
and you like
the people?

1190
01:09:54,486 --> 01:09:56,780
You wouldn't want
to jeopardize all that

1191
01:09:56,905 --> 01:09:58,615
by making some silly
error in judgment...

1192
01:09:58,699 --> 01:10:00,534
would you?

1193
01:10:00,659 --> 01:10:03,996
Holden stole $1 5,000
from the safe last night.

1194
01:10:05,998 --> 01:10:07,958
Did you have anything
to do with it?

1195
01:10:08,041 --> 01:10:09,168
No.

1196
01:10:09,293 --> 01:10:11,920
I don't know anything.

1197
01:10:12,004 --> 01:10:15,465
'Cause we know you're
very tight with Holden.

1198
01:10:15,549 --> 01:10:17,384
I hardly know him.

1199
01:10:20,679 --> 01:10:21,722
I've seen you

1200
01:10:21,847 --> 01:10:24,349
in the storeroom
with him, Justine...

1201
01:10:24,474 --> 01:10:26,518
on many an occasion.

1202
01:10:30,522 --> 01:10:32,816
I think you know him
pretty well.

1203
01:10:38,530 --> 01:10:41,283
I don't know anything.

1204
01:10:48,373 --> 01:10:49,875
Holden: Justine!

1205
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:51,293
Justine!

1206
01:10:51,376 --> 01:10:52,920
Justine!

1207
01:10:57,674 --> 01:10:58,675
I did it.

1208
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:00,010
I finally did something.

1209
01:11:00,135 --> 01:11:01,929
The police are
looking for you.

1210
01:11:02,054 --> 01:11:03,847
Oh, who cares?

1211
01:11:03,972 --> 01:11:06,642
I'm proud of myself.

1212
01:11:06,725 --> 01:11:08,519
Fuck them.
Fuck all of'em.

1213
01:11:08,644 --> 01:11:10,854
Hey! They think that
I'm in on it, too, OK?

1214
01:11:10,979 --> 01:11:12,940
Corny has got a camera
in that storage room.

1215
01:11:13,065 --> 01:11:14,358
That Bible-thumping pervert

1216
01:11:14,483 --> 01:11:15,859
has been watching us
the whole time.

1217
01:11:15,984 --> 01:11:17,361
Well, we're out of here!

1218
01:11:17,486 --> 01:11:19,154
Justine... God.

1219
01:11:19,238 --> 01:11:22,032
I got over $20,000.

1220
01:11:22,157 --> 01:11:23,951
I got a gun. What else?

1221
01:11:24,076 --> 01:11:25,577
Oh, God,
I'm getting all goosey.

1222
01:11:25,702 --> 01:11:27,246
I think
I'm gonna crash.

1223
01:11:35,712 --> 01:11:37,297
I'm pregnant, Holden.

1224
01:11:40,384 --> 01:11:41,802
It's my baby.

1225
01:11:41,927 --> 01:11:43,262
Not necessarily.

1226
01:11:43,387 --> 01:11:45,305
Yes, it is.
You know it is.

1227
01:11:46,932 --> 01:11:48,267
Even if it is...

1228
01:11:48,392 --> 01:11:50,853
you cannot raise
a baby on the run.

1229
01:11:50,936 --> 01:11:52,396
Yes, you can.

1230
01:11:52,521 --> 01:11:54,231
I mean, you can't
raise a baby here.

1231
01:11:54,314 --> 01:11:55,357
You know that.

1232
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:57,359
Justine.

1233
01:11:57,442 --> 01:12:00,279
You hate your husband.
You hate your job.

1234
01:12:00,404 --> 01:12:02,364
You love me, let's go.

1235
01:12:02,447 --> 01:12:03,574
I can't go tonight.

1236
01:12:03,657 --> 01:12:05,033
I gotta pack my things...

1237
01:12:05,117 --> 01:12:07,202
and I'd have
to get more money.

1238
01:12:07,286 --> 01:12:08,662
Well, then tomorrow.

1239
01:12:08,787 --> 01:12:10,622
I'll go to the motel,
and I'll wait for you.

1240
01:12:10,747 --> 01:12:12,666
Just be there by noon.

1241
01:12:12,791 --> 01:12:16,128
Oh, this is just
all going too fast.

1242
01:12:16,253 --> 01:12:18,422
Justine,
what do you have to lose?

1243
01:12:24,469 --> 01:12:26,638
Nothing.

1244
01:12:26,763 --> 01:12:28,557
Well,
then be there by noon.

1245
01:12:33,937 --> 01:12:34,897
OK.

1246
01:12:36,481 --> 01:12:37,774
I love you, Justine.

1247
01:12:37,900 --> 01:12:39,860
This is all
gonna work out.

1248
01:12:39,985 --> 01:12:41,403
I know it.

1249
01:12:41,486 --> 01:12:42,988
Oh, geez, wait.

1250
01:12:43,113 --> 01:12:44,239
I almost forgot.

1251
01:12:45,824 --> 01:12:47,868
Here's a story
of your life.

1252
01:12:47,993 --> 01:12:49,745
You inspired me.

1253
01:13:00,506 --> 01:13:02,341
Phil: Hey, Teeny.

1254
01:13:02,466 --> 01:13:03,550
Hey.

1255
01:13:03,675 --> 01:13:05,010
Getting worried about you.

1256
01:13:05,135 --> 01:13:06,011
Oh, I'm sorry.

1257
01:13:06,136 --> 01:13:07,346
Justine,
this is Floberta.

1258
01:13:07,471 --> 01:13:09,181
Floberta,
this is Justine.

1259
01:13:09,306 --> 01:13:10,557
- Hi.
- Hi.

1260
01:13:10,682 --> 01:13:13,644
Congratulations
on your expectation.

1261
01:13:13,727 --> 01:13:15,270
Thanks.

1262
01:13:15,354 --> 01:13:16,772
Well, you think
it's a girl or a boy?

1263
01:13:16,855 --> 01:13:18,023
It don't make
no difference

1264
01:13:18,148 --> 01:13:19,191
as long as it
plays quarterback

1265
01:13:19,316 --> 01:13:21,026
for the Cowboys.

1266
01:13:22,861 --> 01:13:24,530
Well, I hear
Senor Tuna calling.

1267
01:13:30,994 --> 01:13:31,870
Yello.

1268
01:13:33,830 --> 01:13:34,873
Yeah.

1269
01:13:36,875 --> 01:13:39,044
Well, it's not right.

1270
01:13:39,169 --> 01:13:41,880
What is that
supposed to mean?

1271
01:13:46,009 --> 01:13:47,386
Hey, look... No.

1272
01:13:47,511 --> 01:13:48,804
You... No, you look.

1273
01:13:48,887 --> 01:13:51,098
You... You don't know shit, OK?

1274
01:13:54,101 --> 01:13:55,894
Justine's pregnant.

1275
01:13:56,019 --> 01:13:57,229
You got that?

1276
01:13:58,856 --> 01:13:59,940
Yeah, well, look...

1277
01:14:00,065 --> 01:14:01,608
you better check
your records again, pal...

1278
01:14:01,733 --> 01:14:03,277
then you call me.

1279
01:14:10,450 --> 01:14:13,370
Dumb doctor says
my sperm's no good.

1280
01:14:27,467 --> 01:14:29,636
Does that mean
Justine's not pregnant?

1281
01:14:32,306 --> 01:14:33,348
No.

1282
01:14:33,473 --> 01:14:36,518
It just means
they messed up, is all.

1283
01:14:36,602 --> 01:14:38,312
They don't know
everything.

1284
01:14:41,732 --> 01:14:45,152
They just got it wrong,
is all.

1285
01:15:09,343 --> 01:15:10,469
It looks like

1286
01:15:10,594 --> 01:15:12,513
that wind's
picking up again.

1287
01:15:54,388 --> 01:15:58,725
Justine: How it all came down
to this, only the devil knows.

1288
01:15:58,851 --> 01:16:02,229
Retail Rodeo was
at the corner on my left.

1289
01:16:02,354 --> 01:16:05,566
The motel was
down the road to my right.

1290
01:16:05,691 --> 01:16:07,150
I closed my eyes

1291
01:16:07,276 --> 01:16:09,611
and tried to peer
into the future.

1292
01:16:12,239 --> 01:16:14,908
On my left,
I saw days upon days

1293
01:16:15,033 --> 01:16:17,911
of lipstick
and ticking clocks...

1294
01:16:18,036 --> 01:16:21,081
dirty looks
and quiet whisperings.

1295
01:16:22,291 --> 01:16:24,501
And burning secrets

1296
01:16:24,626 --> 01:16:27,129
that just won't ever
die away.

1297
01:16:30,299 --> 01:16:34,261
And on my right,
what could I picture?

1298
01:16:34,386 --> 01:16:36,763
The blue sky,
the desert earth...

1299
01:16:36,889 --> 01:16:39,933
stretching out into
the eerie infinity...

1300
01:16:40,058 --> 01:16:42,644
a beautiful,
never-ending nothing.

1301
01:17:24,269 --> 01:17:25,812
Hey, Justine.

1302
01:17:30,275 --> 01:17:31,985
I know where
you can find him.

1303
01:17:32,110 --> 01:17:33,070
Jack: Holden?

1304
01:17:33,153 --> 01:17:34,988
He's at
the Motel Glen Capri...

1305
01:17:35,113 --> 01:17:36,740
and he'll be there
till noon.

1306
01:17:38,784 --> 01:17:40,327
You done good.

1307
01:17:40,452 --> 01:17:42,663
You're a good girl.

1308
01:18:26,164 --> 01:18:27,165
Hey.

1309
01:18:27,291 --> 01:18:28,292
Hey.

1310
01:18:28,417 --> 01:18:30,127
What's going on
in the bedroom?

1311
01:18:30,252 --> 01:18:31,962
Looks like
a twister hit it.

1312
01:18:32,087 --> 01:18:33,630
Oh, yeah, I was, uh...

1313
01:18:33,755 --> 01:18:35,215
I was doing laundry.

1314
01:18:35,340 --> 01:18:36,717
I thought we'd been robbed.

1315
01:18:36,842 --> 01:18:39,052
TV: A spokesperson
from the sheriff's office

1316
01:18:39,178 --> 01:18:40,179
will be joining me.

1317
01:18:40,304 --> 01:18:41,722
Why aren't you at work?

1318
01:18:41,847 --> 01:18:43,807
They gave me the day off.

1319
01:18:43,891 --> 01:18:46,935
This is Ken Rudolph reporting
from the Glen Capri Motel

1320
01:18:47,019 --> 01:18:49,438
where a standoff between
police and a local man

1321
01:18:49,521 --> 01:18:51,982
has just ended in bloodshed.

1322
01:18:52,107 --> 01:18:53,275
Police had been given a tip

1323
01:18:53,358 --> 01:18:54,943
that a man suspected
of burglarizing

1324
01:18:55,027 --> 01:18:57,196
a local Retail Rodeo
discount store

1325
01:18:57,321 --> 01:18:58,405
had been staying
at the motel.

1326
01:18:58,405 --> 01:18:59,489
had been staying
at the motel.

1327
01:18:59,615 --> 01:19:01,491
The man was
a Retail Rodeo employee

1328
01:19:01,617 --> 01:19:03,118
named Thomas Worther.

1329
01:19:03,202 --> 01:19:05,662
Worther allegedly began
brandishing a handgun.

1330
01:19:05,787 --> 01:19:08,999
He then fired one shot,
taking his own life.

1331
01:19:09,082 --> 01:19:10,959
Inside the motel room...

1332
01:19:11,043 --> 01:19:13,295
police say they found
$1 5,000 and a handgun...

1333
01:19:13,378 --> 01:19:16,215
Phil: Oh, man.
Retail Rodeo...

1334
01:19:16,340 --> 01:19:18,091
You know that guy?

1335
01:19:18,217 --> 01:19:19,885
TV: Thomas Worther
was 22 years old.

1336
01:19:20,010 --> 01:19:21,094
Mm.

1337
01:19:21,220 --> 01:19:22,846
That is all the information
we have at this time.

1338
01:19:22,930 --> 01:19:24,806
Of course,
details are rather sketchy.

1339
01:19:24,890 --> 01:19:26,808
We'll continue to monitor
the situation...

1340
01:19:33,148 --> 01:19:35,150
...a spokesperson
from the sheriff's office

1341
01:19:35,234 --> 01:19:37,152
will be joining me
in a few moments with an update.

1342
01:19:37,236 --> 01:19:38,779
But for now, I can tell you
what we know.

1343
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:32,040
Attention,
Retail Rodeo employees...

1344
01:20:32,165 --> 01:20:34,084
this is Jack Field,
your store manager.

1345
01:20:34,209 --> 01:20:36,628
As most of y'all
know by now...

1346
01:20:36,753 --> 01:20:39,298
we lost another employee
yesterday.

1347
01:20:41,091 --> 01:20:43,802
Holden was a thief

1348
01:20:43,927 --> 01:20:45,470
and a disturbed young man...

1349
01:20:45,596 --> 01:20:48,307
and what happened
was a sad thing.

1350
01:20:48,432 --> 01:20:50,642
Perhaps we can learn a lesson
from this tragedy...

1351
01:20:50,767 --> 01:20:52,978
like don't steal
and don't be disturbed.

1352
01:20:53,103 --> 01:20:55,731
The important thing
is to move on.

1353
01:20:55,814 --> 01:20:58,275
Life does, and so should we.

1354
01:20:59,860 --> 01:21:01,987
This one's for you, Holden.

1355
01:21:05,866 --> 01:21:10,412
Woman:
~ Who's sorry now? ~

1356
01:21:10,537 --> 01:21:11,622
~ Ooh-ooh ~

1357
01:21:11,747 --> 01:21:14,625
~ Who's sorry now? ~

1358
01:21:14,708 --> 01:21:16,460
I thought we were
gonna get a day

1359
01:21:16,543 --> 01:21:18,295
to grieve
and go to the movies.

1360
01:21:18,378 --> 01:21:23,383
~ Whose heart is aching? ~

1361
01:21:26,345 --> 01:21:27,638
Justine: What?

1362
01:21:27,721 --> 01:21:28,764
What is it?

1363
01:21:28,889 --> 01:21:31,099
I was just at your house,
and the mail came...

1364
01:21:31,183 --> 01:21:33,101
and Phil was opening letters.

1365
01:21:33,185 --> 01:21:34,645
And he opened this bill

1366
01:21:34,728 --> 01:21:36,647
from a credit card company.

1367
01:21:36,730 --> 01:21:38,899
And, fuck...

1368
01:21:38,982 --> 01:21:41,318
please don't tell him
about us, Justine.

1369
01:21:41,401 --> 01:21:44,112
Please. Please.

1370
01:21:44,196 --> 01:21:45,656
I love Phil.

1371
01:21:45,739 --> 01:21:47,908
I love him
more than myself.

1372
01:21:47,991 --> 01:21:50,661
Please have mercy on me.

1373
01:22:03,173 --> 01:22:04,758
Justine: Hey, Phil.

1374
01:22:13,016 --> 01:22:14,935
Have you been
sleeping around

1375
01:22:15,018 --> 01:22:16,562
behind my back?

1376
01:22:18,188 --> 01:22:19,273
What?

1377
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:23,527
I said, have you
been sleeping around

1378
01:22:23,610 --> 01:22:25,028
behind my back?

1379
01:22:28,031 --> 01:22:29,241
Yes.

1380
01:22:35,122 --> 01:22:36,498
Why?

1381
01:22:45,257 --> 01:22:46,341
Why?

1382
01:22:49,761 --> 01:22:51,430
I don't know why.

1383
01:22:57,269 --> 01:22:59,563
Don't you love me?

1384
01:22:59,688 --> 01:23:01,440
Don't you love me
at all?

1385
01:23:01,565 --> 01:23:03,233
Yes.

1386
01:23:03,317 --> 01:23:04,902
You're the only
man alive

1387
01:23:05,027 --> 01:23:06,653
that I love.

1388
01:23:13,785 --> 01:23:15,662
Oh, God,
please don't tell me

1389
01:23:15,787 --> 01:23:18,081
it's not my baby.

1390
01:23:18,207 --> 01:23:19,958
It's your baby.

1391
01:23:21,627 --> 01:23:22,920
Are you sure?

1392
01:23:24,630 --> 01:23:27,758
It is. I swear.
I swear to God.

1393
01:23:31,386 --> 01:23:33,222
Who was he?

1394
01:23:33,305 --> 01:23:35,307
Oh, that doesn't matter.

1395
01:23:35,390 --> 01:23:36,767
Yeah, it does.

1396
01:23:39,394 --> 01:23:41,396
Was it someone from work?

1397
01:23:45,901 --> 01:23:47,653
Yeah, I know who it was.

1398
01:23:49,321 --> 01:23:50,906
It was that
Bible-study guy...

1399
01:23:50,989 --> 01:23:52,783
wasn't it?

1400
01:23:52,908 --> 01:23:54,243
That Nazarene.

1401
01:23:54,326 --> 01:23:56,245
That's why you're
acting so spooked.

1402
01:23:57,996 --> 01:24:00,666
Yeah. It was him.

1403
01:24:05,796 --> 01:24:07,548
I'm gonna beat his ass.

1404
01:24:07,673 --> 01:24:08,882
Phil, don't.

1405
01:24:11,844 --> 01:24:14,680
Ah, you're getting
all swollen.

1406
01:24:16,932 --> 01:24:19,685
I'm sorry
I hit you, baby.

1407
01:24:24,857 --> 01:24:26,608
I'm sorry, Phil.

1408
01:24:39,204 --> 01:24:41,498
I need to get stoned.

1409
01:24:43,584 --> 01:24:44,751
OK.

1410
01:24:46,378 --> 01:24:47,671
Get stoned.

1411
01:24:49,381 --> 01:24:51,758
I just gotta escape,
you know?

1412
01:24:53,343 --> 01:24:54,219
Yeah.

1413
01:24:56,346 --> 01:24:58,223
Do you ever
feel like that...

1414
01:24:58,348 --> 01:25:00,350
like you gotta escape?

1415
01:25:01,977 --> 01:25:03,228
Yeah.

1416
01:25:03,353 --> 01:25:04,813
Yeah, I do.

1417
01:25:28,378 --> 01:25:30,380
What are those?

1418
01:25:30,506 --> 01:25:33,926
Fake eyelashes,
extra long.

1419
01:25:34,051 --> 01:25:36,094
J-Just do it
normal for once.

1420
01:25:36,220 --> 01:25:38,931
You want me to make
the other cheek purple

1421
01:25:39,056 --> 01:25:40,349
to even it out?

1422
01:25:41,934 --> 01:25:43,268
No.

1423
01:25:46,730 --> 01:25:48,607
Cheryl: Did you
hear about Corny?

1424
01:25:48,732 --> 01:25:49,942
He was going home

1425
01:25:50,067 --> 01:25:51,985
after Bible study
last night...

1426
01:25:52,110 --> 01:25:54,238
and 2 beefy guys
with painted faces

1427
01:25:54,321 --> 01:25:57,741
pulled up in a truck
and jumped him.

1428
01:25:57,824 --> 01:26:00,536
That's terrible.

1429
01:26:02,329 --> 01:26:03,288
Yeah.

1430
01:26:06,500 --> 01:26:08,710
Justine:
That day, I read the story

1431
01:26:08,794 --> 01:26:10,420
Holden wrote for me.

1432
01:26:12,798 --> 01:26:15,759
It was kind of different
from the other ones

1433
01:26:15,843 --> 01:26:17,386
but kind of the same.

1434
01:26:23,267 --> 01:26:25,727
It was about a girl
who was put upon...

1435
01:26:25,853 --> 01:26:29,731
whose job
is like a prison

1436
01:26:29,815 --> 01:26:33,277
and whose life
has lost all meaning.

1437
01:26:33,360 --> 01:26:35,279
Other people
don't get her...

1438
01:26:35,362 --> 01:26:36,780
...new places
all the time.

1439
01:26:36,864 --> 01:26:38,574
especially her husband.

1440
01:26:43,036 --> 01:26:45,247
One day she meets a boy
who's also put upon...

1441
01:26:45,330 --> 01:26:48,292
and they fall in love.

1442
01:26:53,714 --> 01:26:55,799
After spending
their whole lives

1443
01:26:55,924 --> 01:26:57,801
never getting got...

1444
01:26:57,885 --> 01:26:59,803
with one look...

1445
01:26:59,887 --> 01:27:02,431
they get each other
completely.

1446
01:27:07,728 --> 01:27:09,646
That's my big baby.

1447
01:27:09,730 --> 01:27:12,107
In the end,
the girl and the boy

1448
01:27:12,191 --> 01:27:15,277
run away together
into the wilderness...

1449
01:27:15,402 --> 01:27:18,071
never to be heard from again.

1450
01:28:41,697 --> 01:28:43,657
~ Railroad Bill ~

1451
01:28:43,740 --> 01:28:47,828
~ Got a $40 bill ~

1452
01:28:47,953 --> 01:28:52,332
~ Took all the boys
on a trip to Mobile ~

1453
01:28:52,416 --> 01:28:54,710
~ Riding the road ~

1454
01:28:54,793 --> 01:28:56,086
~ With Railroad Bill ~

1455
01:28:56,211 --> 01:28:57,087
~ Railroad ~

1456
01:28:57,212 --> 01:28:58,630
~ Railroad ~

1457
01:28:58,755 --> 01:29:01,967
~ Railroad Bill ~

1458
01:29:02,092 --> 01:29:04,178
~ You ain't
never worked ~

1459
01:29:04,303 --> 01:29:08,182
~ And you know
you never will ~

1460
01:29:08,307 --> 01:29:09,474
~ Riding the road ~

1461
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:10,976
~ Ohh ~

1462
01:29:11,101 --> 01:29:12,144
~ With Railroad Bill ~

1463
01:29:12,269 --> 01:29:14,271
~ Railroad Bill ~

1464
01:29:14,396 --> 01:29:17,274
~ A.44 pistol ~

1465
01:29:17,399 --> 01:29:20,819
