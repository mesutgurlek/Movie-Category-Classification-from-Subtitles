1
00:00:39,042 --> 00:00:45,413
<i>Once there was a way
To get back homeward</i>

2
00:00:45,582 --> 00:00:49,575
<i>Are the stars out tonight?</i>

3
00:00:49,753 --> 00:00:55,020
<i>Once there was a way to get back home</i>

4
00:00:55,192 --> 00:00:57,456
<i>I only have eyes</i>

5
00:00:57,627 --> 00:01:02,655
<i>Sleep, pretty darling, do not cry</i>

6
00:01:02,833 --> 00:01:05,165
<i>For you</i>

7
00:01:05,335 --> 00:01:07,929
<i>And I will sing a lullaby</i>

8
00:01:08,104 --> 00:01:11,039
<i>With a song in my heart</i>

9
00:01:11,541 --> 00:01:13,600
<i>So tell me</i>

10
00:01:13,777 --> 00:01:17,076
<i>Tell me something good</i>

11
00:01:19,416 --> 00:01:22,249
<i>Tell me that you love me</i>

12
00:01:22,419 --> 00:01:25,047
<i>Tell me, baby</i>

13
00:01:25,222 --> 00:01:27,622
<i>Tell me something good</i>

14
00:01:27,791 --> 00:01:29,520
<i>Only you</i>

15
00:01:29,693 --> 00:01:31,593
<i>But how can you know for sure?</i>

16
00:01:31,761 --> 00:01:34,696
<i>Can make this world seem right</i>

17
00:01:34,865 --> 00:01:36,423
<i>Is there really just one?</i>

18
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,228
<i>I need your love</i>

19
00:01:39,636 --> 00:01:44,005
<i>So many songs, but I'm feeling so lonely.</i>

20
00:01:44,207 --> 00:01:47,973
<i>Where is the love?</i>

21
00:01:52,048 --> 00:01:56,485
<i>You don't have to be beautiful</i>

22
00:01:56,653 --> 00:01:59,588
<i>To turn me on</i>

23
00:02:00,457 --> 00:02:03,824
<i>I just need your body, baby</i>

24
00:02:03,994 --> 00:02:05,222
<i>Hello</i>

25
00:02:05,395 --> 00:02:08,660
<i>- From dusk till dawn
- Is it me you're looking for?</i>

26
00:02:08,832 --> 00:02:11,926
<i>You don't need experience</i>

27
00:02:12,102 --> 00:02:13,194
<i>Take</i>

28
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:16,862
<i>- To turn me out
- These broken wings</i>

29
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,134
<i>You just leave it all up to me</i>

30
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:25,247
<i>Let's talk about eggs, baby
Let's talk about you and me</i>

31
00:02:25,415 --> 00:02:27,042
<i>You don't have to be rich</i>

32
00:02:27,217 --> 00:02:29,481
<i>- Give me all your loving
- To be my pearl</i>

33
00:02:29,653 --> 00:02:33,589
<i>You don't have to be cool
To rule my world</i>

34
00:02:33,757 --> 00:02:37,853
<i>Ain't no particular song
I'm more compatible with</i>

35
00:02:38,028 --> 00:02:40,462
<i>I just want your extra...</i>

36
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:43,360
Boys. Boys.

37
00:02:43,533 --> 00:02:45,364
Give a chick a chance.

38
00:02:45,535 --> 00:02:49,972
<i>Well, since my baby left me</i>

39
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:53,541
<i>I found a new place to dwell</i>

40
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:58,204
<i>It's down at the end of Lonely Street
At Heartbreak Hotel</i>

41
00:02:58,381 --> 00:03:01,817
<i>And I said, "I'm feelin' so lonely, baby</i>

42
00:03:01,985 --> 00:03:04,545
<i>I'm feelin' so lonely</i>

43
00:03:04,721 --> 00:03:07,019
<i>Oh, I'm feelin' so lonely"...</i>

44
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:10,182
<i>I could die</i>

45
00:03:11,695 --> 00:03:17,065
<i>Don't have to be rich to be my girl</i>

46
00:03:17,233 --> 00:03:22,227
<i>Don't have to be cool to rule my world</i>

47
00:03:22,405 --> 00:03:23,895
<i>You rule my world</i>

48
00:03:24,074 --> 00:03:28,773
<i>You're the particular song
I'm compatible with</i>

49
00:03:28,945 --> 00:03:30,776
<i>I just want your</i>

50
00:03:30,947 --> 00:03:34,474
<i>- Extra time
- Extra time</i>

51
00:03:34,651 --> 00:03:40,749
<i>- And your kiss
- And your kiss</i>

52
00:03:40,924 --> 00:03:44,257
<i>His mom and dad met in the usual way.</i>

53
00:03:44,427 --> 00:03:47,157
<i>The song became love...</i>

54
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:50,766
<i>...and love became the egg.</i>

55
00:03:55,472 --> 00:03:57,099
Memphis?

56
00:03:57,273 --> 00:03:59,605
- You got it, sugar?
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.

57
00:03:59,776 --> 00:04:01,368
Safe and warm.

58
00:04:01,544 --> 00:04:03,034
Hold it tight, now.

59
00:04:03,213 --> 00:04:05,647
Whoa, I think I felt a move in there.

60
00:04:05,815 --> 00:04:07,908
<i>And in the usual way...</i>

61
00:04:08,084 --> 00:04:10,746
<i>...the moms left for the fishing season...</i>

62
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:15,152
<i>...while the dads stayed home
to do egg time.</i>

63
00:04:15,325 --> 00:04:16,587
You gonna be okay, Daddy?

64
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:20,287
Oh, sure, honey. We'll be waiting for you,
right here on Lonely Street.

65
00:04:20,463 --> 00:04:25,332
<i>I love you more and more, tell me why</i>

66
00:04:25,502 --> 00:04:26,799
Bye-bye, now.

67
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:30,269
Goodbye, Norma Jean.
Don't you worry about a thing.

68
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,273
<i>Don't wanna let you go</i>

69
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:37,805
<i>I never can say goodbye, boy</i>

70
00:04:40,683 --> 00:04:43,948
When all others leave...

71
00:04:44,721 --> 00:04:46,188
...we remain!

72
00:04:46,356 --> 00:04:49,052
When the sun vanishes...

73
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,151
...we remain!

74
00:04:52,328 --> 00:04:55,820
<i>I'm feelin' so lonely
I'm feelin' so lonely...</i>

75
00:04:55,999 --> 00:05:00,993
Heed the wisdoms, brothers!
Make a huddle!

76
00:05:01,171 --> 00:05:04,004
Warm thy egg!

77
00:05:04,174 --> 00:05:05,732
Make a huddle!

78
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:09,104
- Share the cold!
- Share the cold.

79
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:13,045
Each must take his turn
against the icy blast...

80
00:05:13,216 --> 00:05:16,242
...if we are to survive the endless night.

81
00:05:18,388 --> 00:05:21,016
<i>Raise your voices, brothers!</i>

82
00:05:21,191 --> 00:05:23,853
<i>Give praise to the Great 'Guin...</i>

83
00:05:24,027 --> 00:05:29,659
<i>...who puts songs in our hearts
and fish in our bellies!</i>

84
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:39,499
<i>Ain't no particular song
I'm more compatible with</i>

85
00:05:39,709 --> 00:05:43,076
oh, baby, I think I wanna dance now.

86
00:05:44,914 --> 00:05:46,438
No, no, no.

87
00:05:48,852 --> 00:05:51,650
<i>There is a wisdom,
brothers and sisters...</i>

88
00:05:51,821 --> 00:05:55,188
<i>...that stands above all others.</i>

89
00:05:55,825 --> 00:05:58,521
<i>- Never, ever...
- It's okay.</i>

90
00:05:58,695 --> 00:06:00,560
<i>- ... no matter what...
- No harm done. See?</i>

91
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:02,630
<i>...drop your egg.</i>

92
00:06:02,799 --> 00:06:05,825
No, we're cool. We're cool.

93
00:06:14,344 --> 00:06:19,782
<i>Of the many thousands who sang
through that long night of winter...</i>

94
00:06:19,949 --> 00:06:24,147
<i>...it was Memphis
who cried out most fervently...</i>

95
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:29,451
<i>...to turn the Earth
and bring back the sun.</i>

96
00:07:07,897 --> 00:07:09,762
- It's a boy!
- Hey, it's a girl!

97
00:07:09,933 --> 00:07:11,958
- What a peach!
- What a bruiser!

98
00:07:12,135 --> 00:07:14,296
- Come here, son.
- Come to Daddy, there you go.

99
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:16,370
Son, you have made
your daddy so proud.

100
00:07:16,539 --> 00:07:18,370
It's all genetics, you know.

101
00:07:28,985 --> 00:07:30,213
Memphis?

102
00:07:30,386 --> 00:07:33,150
Is everything okay?

103
00:07:34,023 --> 00:07:36,821
I don't know. I can't hear anything.

104
00:07:42,398 --> 00:07:44,025
- Is it empty?
- Honey.

105
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,292
- Can I have it?
- Gloria.

106
00:07:45,468 --> 00:07:47,629
It's okay, Maurice.

107
00:07:54,377 --> 00:07:57,039
It happens sometimes, Memphis.

108
00:07:57,647 --> 00:07:58,739
Yeah.

109
00:08:04,921 --> 00:08:06,445
Wait, you hear that?

110
00:08:07,757 --> 00:08:09,349
- Yeah.
- Hey, I can hear you, buddy.

111
00:08:09,926 --> 00:08:12,520
Oh, your papa's here, it's okay.

112
00:08:14,364 --> 00:08:17,629
Oh, he's okay, Maurice.
Whoa, there it is!

113
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,030
That's his little foot there.

114
00:08:20,703 --> 00:08:22,500
There's his other one.

115
00:08:24,874 --> 00:08:26,273
That's different.

116
00:08:26,442 --> 00:08:28,342
Hey! Come back here, Mr. Mumble.

117
00:08:28,511 --> 00:08:29,500
Gloria...

118
00:08:29,679 --> 00:08:31,738
She can call him
whatever the heck she likes.

119
00:08:31,914 --> 00:08:33,745
Whoa, little Mumble.

120
00:08:38,788 --> 00:08:41,018
- Mumble? Mumble?
- You okay?

121
00:08:42,258 --> 00:08:44,954
Freezing. Freezing.

122
00:08:45,128 --> 00:08:46,425
Oh, you'll get used to it.

123
00:08:48,398 --> 00:08:49,797
Come on. Come to your daddy.

124
00:08:52,201 --> 00:08:54,726
- What do you make of that?
- Little wobbly in the knees.

125
00:08:54,904 --> 00:08:56,098
- Is he okay?
- I don't know.

126
00:08:56,272 --> 00:08:57,569
What you doing there, boy?

127
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:59,037
I'm happy, Pa.

128
00:08:59,876 --> 00:09:01,241
What you doing with your feet?

129
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:04,369
They're happy too.

130
00:09:04,547 --> 00:09:07,072
- I wouldn't do that around folks, son.
- Why not?

131
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:10,117
- Well, it just ain't penguin, okay?
- Okay.

132
00:09:10,286 --> 00:09:13,653
Yeah. Hey, come on over here.
Get under here. Get warm.

133
00:09:13,823 --> 00:09:16,087
Watch the beak. Watch the beak... Beak!

134
00:09:16,259 --> 00:09:17,692
The beak.

135
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:20,590
Okay, good boy.

136
00:09:26,502 --> 00:09:28,766
So late. What's keeping them?

137
00:09:28,938 --> 00:09:32,738
Pray, brothers, the Great 'Guin
does not test us with a lean season.

138
00:09:32,909 --> 00:09:36,504
Why, Noah? Have we not all been dutiful?

139
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:38,911
So when you see your mama...

140
00:09:39,082 --> 00:09:41,209
- I stand perfectly still.
- You got it.

141
00:09:41,384 --> 00:09:44,114
But how will I know
which one's my mama?

142
00:09:44,287 --> 00:09:45,379
Oh, you'll know.

143
00:09:45,555 --> 00:09:48,353
She's got a wiggle in her walk
and a giggle in her talk.

144
00:09:48,725 --> 00:09:52,161
And when she sings,
it darn near breaks your heart.

145
00:09:58,468 --> 00:10:00,663
Hey, wait. I see them. I see them!

146
00:10:00,837 --> 00:10:02,065
You're right! You're right!

147
00:10:02,238 --> 00:10:04,468
Wives, ho!

148
00:10:04,974 --> 00:10:06,532
Wives, ho!

149
00:10:06,976 --> 00:10:08,603
Wives, ho!

150
00:10:08,945 --> 00:10:12,506
Wait, no. Wait, no, Mumble, get back here.
No, Mumble! Get back... Mumble!

151
00:10:12,682 --> 00:10:15,947
Mumble! Mumble!

152
00:10:16,586 --> 00:10:18,850
Mumble!

153
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:22,482
Michelle? Michelle?

154
00:10:22,658 --> 00:10:25,092
- Roxanne?
- Michelle?

155
00:10:26,729 --> 00:10:29,027
Alfie?

156
00:10:30,733 --> 00:10:33,361
- Maurice!
- Michelle! Michelle!

157
00:10:33,536 --> 00:10:34,696
Mommy!

158
00:10:34,871 --> 00:10:36,463
Oh, she's so darling.

159
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:41,303
Excuse me. Pardon me, pardon me.
Mumble? Mumble?

160
00:10:41,477 --> 00:10:42,501
Oh, Mumble.

161
00:10:42,678 --> 00:10:45,010
- Mama?
- Mumble!

162
00:10:45,181 --> 00:10:47,342
- Mama?
- Mumble!

163
00:10:47,517 --> 00:10:48,882
Mumble!

164
00:10:49,051 --> 00:10:50,313
Mama? Mama?

165
00:10:50,486 --> 00:10:53,546
- Mumble, boy, where are you?
- Mama!

166
00:10:59,429 --> 00:11:01,260
Memphis?

167
00:11:02,632 --> 00:11:05,328
Oh, Mama. Oh, Mama.

168
00:11:06,102 --> 00:11:08,195
- Oh, my.
- Daddy.

169
00:11:08,571 --> 00:11:10,334
So where's the baby?

170
00:11:10,506 --> 00:11:12,804
Well, honey, I'll find him.

171
00:11:12,975 --> 00:11:15,068
- You lost the baby? Memphis!
- It's okay.

172
00:11:15,244 --> 00:11:17,109
- Mama? Mama?
- Stay!

173
00:11:19,849 --> 00:11:21,180
- Come to Mommy.
- No, Mumble.

174
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:23,443
Mama, Mama.

175
00:11:23,986 --> 00:11:25,817
Hey, what's wrong with his feet?

176
00:11:25,988 --> 00:11:29,719
Oh, that's just a little thing he's got going.
He'll grow out of it.

177
00:11:29,892 --> 00:11:31,792
Mama!

178
00:11:32,962 --> 00:11:35,590
Oh, Memphis, he's gorgeous.

179
00:11:35,765 --> 00:11:38,461
- Isn't he, though?
- Look at you.

180
00:11:38,634 --> 00:11:40,625
I got something for you.

181
00:11:40,803 --> 00:11:42,532
Open up.

182
00:11:46,042 --> 00:11:48,738
Oh, I love the way she does that.

183
00:11:52,248 --> 00:11:54,182
<i>W, X, Y and Z</i>

184
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:55,544
Good morning, class.

185
00:11:55,718 --> 00:11:58,084
Good morning, Miss viola.

186
00:11:58,254 --> 00:11:59,243
Right.

187
00:11:59,422 --> 00:12:02,823
Well, today we begin with the most
important lesson you will ever learn...

188
00:12:02,992 --> 00:12:04,289
...at Penguin Elementary.

189
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:06,121
Does anyone know what that is?

190
00:12:06,295 --> 00:12:07,557
Anyone? Anyone?

191
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:08,719
Someone? Seymour?

192
00:12:08,898 --> 00:12:10,798
- Fishing?
- No.

193
00:12:10,967 --> 00:12:12,332
Mumble?

194
00:12:12,502 --> 00:12:14,094
Don't eat yellow snow?

195
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:15,669
No, that's not it, no.

196
00:12:15,838 --> 00:12:19,001
- It's our Heartsong, Miss.
- Thank you, Gloria. Excellent, yes.

197
00:12:19,175 --> 00:12:22,042
Without our Heartsong,
we can't be truly penguin, can we?

198
00:12:22,211 --> 00:12:24,008
No.

199
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:27,547
But, my dears, it's not something
that I can actually teach you.

200
00:12:27,717 --> 00:12:30,117
Does anybody know why?
Anyone? Anyone?

201
00:12:30,286 --> 00:12:31,947
You can't teach it to us, ma'am...

202
00:12:32,121 --> 00:12:35,750
...because we have to find
our Heartsongs all by ourselves.

203
00:12:35,925 --> 00:12:36,914
Well done, you.

204
00:12:37,093 --> 00:12:38,754
It's the voice you hear inside...

205
00:12:38,928 --> 00:12:40,520
...who you truly are.

206
00:12:40,696 --> 00:12:43,221
Yes. Thank you, Gloria.
Excellent, lovely, thank you.

207
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:45,765
So let's all be very still now.

208
00:12:45,935 --> 00:12:49,200
Take a moment and let it come to you.

209
00:12:49,372 --> 00:12:50,464
- I got one!
- Pick me!

210
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,575
- Pick me! Pick me!
- One at a time. Yes, Seymour.

211
00:12:53,743 --> 00:12:57,873
<i>Don't push me
'Cause I am close to the edge</i>

212
00:12:58,047 --> 00:13:00,982
<i>I'm trying not to lose my head</i>

213
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:04,119
Yes, I like that one. I could
really get jiggy with that. Lovely.

214
00:13:04,287 --> 00:13:05,879
I'm ready. I got one.

215
00:13:06,055 --> 00:13:08,615
Oh, I thought you might, Gloria.

216
00:13:11,193 --> 00:13:14,492
<i>Midnight creeps so slowly</i>

217
00:13:14,664 --> 00:13:17,098
<i>Into hearts of those</i>

218
00:13:17,266 --> 00:13:19,860
<i>Who need more than they get</i>

219
00:13:20,036 --> 00:13:22,937
<i>Daylight deals a bad hand</i>

220
00:13:23,105 --> 00:13:25,130
<i>To a penguin</i>

221
00:13:25,308 --> 00:13:31,736
<i>Who has laid too many bets</i>

222
00:13:32,081 --> 00:13:33,708
That's as far as I got so far.

223
00:13:33,883 --> 00:13:36,477
- Oh, yes, lovely. Really lovely.
- That's beautiful.

224
00:13:36,652 --> 00:13:39,917
Well, Mumble, since
you seem so keen to share.

225
00:13:40,723 --> 00:13:44,659
Mine's sort of a boom and a:

226
00:13:47,363 --> 00:13:48,660
And another boom.

227
00:13:48,831 --> 00:13:49,957
You heard that in there?

228
00:13:50,132 --> 00:13:52,396
- Do you like it?
- I'm afraid that's not a tune.

229
00:13:52,868 --> 00:13:56,827
- It's not?
- No, dear. A tune is like:

230
00:14:00,176 --> 00:14:02,303
Oh, okay.

231
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:08,345
Who is that?

232
00:14:08,517 --> 00:14:11,350
That is the offspring of Memphis
and Norma Jean.

233
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,078
The wee hippity-hopper.

234
00:14:19,495 --> 00:14:21,486
It's not funny!

235
00:14:21,664 --> 00:14:23,689
No. No, not in the least.

236
00:14:23,866 --> 00:14:27,324
A penguin without a Heartsong
is hardly a penguin at all.

237
00:14:27,503 --> 00:14:29,937
I think he broke my ear.

238
00:14:31,073 --> 00:14:32,802
In all my years, I've never, I mean...

239
00:14:32,975 --> 00:14:36,570
And you having such fine voices.
Well, it's bizarre.

240
00:14:36,746 --> 00:14:40,273
Did anything happen, you know,
during early development?

241
00:14:40,449 --> 00:14:42,883
No, all fine. Normal incubation.

242
00:14:43,052 --> 00:14:44,383
- Right.
- Wasn't it, honey?

243
00:14:44,553 --> 00:14:48,148
Yeah. Yeah, it was a tough winter,
I guess.

244
00:14:48,324 --> 00:14:49,313
Right, right.

245
00:14:49,492 --> 00:14:51,960
- He did hatch a little late...
- Yes, I understand. Yes.

246
00:14:52,128 --> 00:14:55,188
- To think he might spend his life alone...
- Quite, quite.

247
00:14:55,364 --> 00:14:57,525
...never to meet his one true love.

248
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:00,897
Oh, please, Miss viola,
isn't there something we can do?

249
00:15:02,038 --> 00:15:04,529
Well, there is always Mrs. Astrakhan.

250
00:15:04,707 --> 00:15:05,696
Mrs. Astrakhan?

251
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:08,639
If anyone can, Mrs. Astrakhan can.

252
00:15:13,015 --> 00:15:14,243
Can't sing?

253
00:15:14,417 --> 00:15:16,681
Can't sing? Rubbish, darling.

254
00:15:16,852 --> 00:15:19,480
Every little penguin has a song.

255
00:15:19,655 --> 00:15:21,282
When I have finished...

256
00:15:21,457 --> 00:15:25,120
...your singing will be giving everyone
the goose pimple.

257
00:15:25,294 --> 00:15:29,196
Now, to begin.
First, we must find a feeling.

258
00:15:29,365 --> 00:15:32,493
Happy feeling, sad feeling.

259
00:15:32,668 --> 00:15:36,001
Maybe lonely feeling.

260
00:15:36,505 --> 00:15:38,370
You feel it?

261
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:41,567
Good. Now, let it out.

262
00:15:41,744 --> 00:15:44,440
Be spontaneous.

263
00:15:48,384 --> 00:15:49,681
That, what is that?

264
00:15:49,852 --> 00:15:52,047
I'm being spontan-you-us.

265
00:15:53,489 --> 00:15:56,322
Darling, you want to meet beautiful girl?

266
00:15:56,492 --> 00:15:57,857
You want to make the egg?

267
00:15:58,027 --> 00:15:59,119
Oh, yes.

268
00:15:59,295 --> 00:16:04,699
Well, sing! And no jiggy-jog.
Do not move muscle.

269
00:16:04,867 --> 00:16:06,994
No moving!

270
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:11,206
<i>Twinkle, twinkle, little star</i>

271
00:16:11,907 --> 00:16:12,965
Enough!

272
00:16:13,142 --> 00:16:16,339
Okay. We go back to the top.

273
00:16:16,912 --> 00:16:20,439
Forget body. Look inside soul.

274
00:16:20,616 --> 00:16:24,313
Feel the feeling. Enormous feeling.

275
00:16:24,487 --> 00:16:27,854
So enormous it fills whole body.

276
00:16:28,023 --> 00:16:31,288
It must escape or you explode.

277
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:34,293
- Now, open your little beak.
- Come on.

278
00:16:34,463 --> 00:16:37,591
Yes, yes. Lift up the head, that's it.

279
00:16:37,767 --> 00:16:40,065
Now... Now...

280
00:16:40,236 --> 00:16:44,935
<i>Now</i>

281
00:17:13,836 --> 00:17:16,202
Disaster! Catastrophe!

282
00:17:16,372 --> 00:17:18,636
I never fail before.

283
00:17:18,808 --> 00:17:21,936
Never! Never!

284
00:17:30,719 --> 00:17:33,984
- Well, I thought it was kind of cute.
- But it just ain't penguin, okay?

285
00:17:34,156 --> 00:17:37,421
So what if he's a little different?
I always kind of liked different.

286
00:17:37,593 --> 00:17:40,255
He's not different.
He's a regular emperor penguin.

287
00:17:40,429 --> 00:17:42,454
Hey, you know what? I can leave school.

288
00:17:42,631 --> 00:17:44,826
I can go to work. The three of us.

289
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,834
Whoa, little fella. You ain't going nowhere
till you got yourself an education.

290
00:17:49,004 --> 00:17:51,939
You get them singing muscles
big and strong, you got that?

291
00:17:52,107 --> 00:17:53,233
I'll try, Pa.

292
00:17:53,409 --> 00:17:56,901
You bet you will. The word "triumph"
starts with "try," and it ends with?

293
00:17:57,079 --> 00:18:00,742
- "Umph. "
- That's right. A great big "umph. "

294
00:18:01,517 --> 00:18:03,075
I'm going fishing.

295
00:18:09,024 --> 00:18:11,219
Oh, Mumble.

296
00:18:14,964 --> 00:18:17,398
<i>That first hard summer...</i>

297
00:18:17,566 --> 00:18:20,592
<i>...while his mom and dad
were working overtime...</i>

298
00:18:20,769 --> 00:18:23,670
<i>...on the great commute to the sea...</i>

299
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:28,173
<i>...Mumble found a place
away from disapproving eyes...</i>

300
00:18:28,344 --> 00:18:33,805
<i>...where a funky little fella
could be himself.</i>

301
00:19:28,437 --> 00:19:30,905
Hey, what you doing there, flipper bird?

302
00:19:31,073 --> 00:19:33,303
Nothing. What are you doing?

303
00:19:33,475 --> 00:19:36,308
Nothing. Just dropped in
for a little lunch.

304
00:19:36,478 --> 00:19:39,208
There's food? Here?

305
00:19:39,748 --> 00:19:41,306
Leg or wing?

306
00:19:41,483 --> 00:19:43,917
Oh, no, no, wait. Not me, I'm a penguin.

307
00:19:44,086 --> 00:19:47,783
Exactly. The flipper birds,
that's you, eat the fish.

308
00:19:47,957 --> 00:19:51,484
The flying birds, that's me,
eat the flipper bird and the fish.

309
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,890
And lately, there ain't a lot of fish.

310
00:19:54,063 --> 00:19:56,156
- So...
- This time I'm getting the juicy bits.

311
00:19:56,332 --> 00:19:58,732
- Me first!
- Hey, you want a piece of me?

312
00:19:58,901 --> 00:20:01,563
Hey, hey, hey!
I'm trying to think about lunch.

313
00:20:01,737 --> 00:20:04,934
Wait! Watch this!

314
00:20:10,212 --> 00:20:15,309
Yeah, that's weird, all right. Listen.
For once, we're gonna do this civilized.

315
00:20:15,484 --> 00:20:18,078
- Now, get in line...
- Hey! What's that on your leg?

316
00:20:18,253 --> 00:20:21,381
- What? This little thing?
- Oh, no. Don't start him on that.

317
00:20:21,557 --> 00:20:24,685
Shut up! The little flipper bird
asked me a perceptive question.

318
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:27,556
- A question like that deserves an answer.
- Here we go.

319
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:29,391
I got two words for you:

320
00:20:30,065 --> 00:20:32,625
"Alien abduction. "

321
00:20:32,801 --> 00:20:34,496
- Oh, you had to ask.
- Have mercy.

322
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:36,535
Quiet!

323
00:20:36,705 --> 00:20:40,106
Now, little buddy,
there is something out there.

324
00:20:40,275 --> 00:20:42,368
Creatures. Not like us.

325
00:20:42,544 --> 00:20:44,774
Bigger, fiercer, and smarter too.

326
00:20:44,947 --> 00:20:46,437
- Ask me how I know.
- How?

327
00:20:46,615 --> 00:20:48,776
Because I've been captured by them,
that's how.

328
00:20:48,951 --> 00:20:49,975
Unbelievable.

329
00:20:50,152 --> 00:20:52,120
What do you mean "unbelievable?"
It's true.

330
00:20:52,287 --> 00:20:54,517
I'm sitting on a rock,
minding my own business...

331
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:56,282
...when suddenly, they're onto me.

332
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:58,585
These beings, like big ugly penguins.

333
00:20:58,761 --> 00:21:00,888
Fat, flabby faces with front-ways eyes...

334
00:21:01,063 --> 00:21:04,464
...no feathers, no beaks,
and these... These appendages.

335
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,325
They probe me. They tie me up.
They strap me down.

336
00:21:07,503 --> 00:21:10,370
They take this pointy thing
and they stick it into me.

337
00:21:10,539 --> 00:21:13,099
And then, blackout.

338
00:21:13,275 --> 00:21:14,674
Gosh.

339
00:21:14,843 --> 00:21:17,778
I woke up and there's this...
This thing on me.

340
00:21:17,946 --> 00:21:22,178
Every flying bird is dissing me,
"Hey, what's happening, yellow leg?"

341
00:21:22,351 --> 00:21:24,342
It was humiliating.

342
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,680
And then what?

343
00:21:25,854 --> 00:21:28,880
It was humiliating.
What more do you want?

344
00:21:29,892 --> 00:21:32,019
They could have eated you.

345
00:21:32,995 --> 00:21:35,156
Yeah. Yeah.

346
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:38,561
I guess my pitiful cries for mercy
appealed to their better nature.

347
00:21:39,001 --> 00:21:41,902
Can I appeal to your better nature?

348
00:21:42,671 --> 00:21:45,868
Nice try, kid, but no.

349
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:49,978
No. No. No!

350
00:21:50,145 --> 00:21:51,976
What you doing down there, flipper bird?

351
00:21:52,147 --> 00:21:53,136
Get up here.

352
00:21:53,315 --> 00:21:54,942
Get back up here this minute.

353
00:21:55,117 --> 00:21:57,278
Oh, great. You let him get away.
Didn't you?

354
00:21:57,453 --> 00:21:58,750
All your screwy alien talk.

355
00:21:58,921 --> 00:22:01,185
- Hey, I'm an abductee.
- Abduct this.

356
00:22:01,356 --> 00:22:03,984
- Don't make me call Uncle Angie.
- Oh, fine.

357
00:22:04,226 --> 00:22:06,251
Where youse going? I'm an abductee!

358
00:22:06,428 --> 00:22:09,989
- I don't care what you are, I'm hungry!
- Would you like to hear our specials?

359
00:22:10,165 --> 00:22:13,430
How about fish? There's no fish.
How about penguin? There's no penguin.

360
00:22:13,602 --> 00:22:15,593
What are we gonna eat?!

361
00:22:24,179 --> 00:22:30,118
<i>There's a world where I can go</i>

362
00:22:30,285 --> 00:22:35,621
<i>And tell my secrets to</i>

363
00:22:35,791 --> 00:22:37,952
<i>In my room</i>

364
00:22:38,127 --> 00:22:41,563
<i>Paying no mind to his dancing heart...</i>

365
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:46,064
<i>...the kid saw out his school days
at the back of the class...</i>

366
00:22:46,235 --> 00:22:49,261
<i>...lost in his imaginings.</i>

367
00:22:50,239 --> 00:22:53,106
<i>Now it's dark and I'm...</i>

368
00:22:53,542 --> 00:22:58,309
<i>What fabulous worlds lay out there,
far beyond the ice?</i>

369
00:22:58,947 --> 00:23:01,472
<i>- I won't be afraid</i>

370
00:23:02,017 --> 00:23:03,450
<i>Was there any place...</i>

371
00:23:03,619 --> 00:23:07,111
<i>...where one small penguin
without a Heartsong...</i>

372
00:23:07,289 --> 00:23:09,985
<i>...could ever truly belong?</i>

373
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:13,925
<i>In my room</i>

374
00:23:26,475 --> 00:23:28,909
And so, a thousand generations ago...

375
00:23:29,077 --> 00:23:32,604
...our forefathers
forsook our wings for flippers.

376
00:23:32,781 --> 00:23:35,807
You graduates going to sea
for the first time...

377
00:23:35,984 --> 00:23:38,680
...are to reap the benefits
of their wise choice.

378
00:23:39,454 --> 00:23:41,888
These are lean and uncertain times.

379
00:23:42,057 --> 00:23:44,821
But by the power
of the ancient penguin wisdoms...

380
00:23:44,993 --> 00:23:48,087
...we, my brethren, will endure.

381
00:23:48,263 --> 00:23:51,061
- "Blah, blah, blah. "
- Norma Jean.

382
00:23:51,233 --> 00:23:55,135
Who is he to say my boy can't graduate?
He's not hurting anyone.

383
00:23:55,304 --> 00:23:59,832
- True to our ways
and you will always be worthy of this...

384
00:24:00,008 --> 00:24:05,139
<i>...our brave penguin nation. Excelsior!</i>

385
00:24:17,893 --> 00:24:20,157
Ocean, here I come!

386
00:24:21,897 --> 00:24:25,526
You know what? We're gonna have
a little graduation ceremony of our own.

387
00:24:25,701 --> 00:24:27,066
- You mean it, Ma?
- You betcha.

388
00:24:27,236 --> 00:24:29,898
<i>- Excelsior!
- Excelsior!</i>

389
00:24:30,939 --> 00:24:32,600
Keep it down.

390
00:24:32,774 --> 00:24:35,208
- Pa.
- Memphis.

391
00:24:37,846 --> 00:24:40,815
- Go get them, tiger.
- Thanks, Ma.

392
00:24:43,518 --> 00:24:45,748
- Make every moment count!
- Got you, Ma!

393
00:24:45,921 --> 00:24:48,014
- Remember, "Stranger Danger. "
- Yeah, sure, Pa.

394
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:52,388
And watch out for those leopard seals
and them killer whales.

395
00:24:52,561 --> 00:24:53,926
Mark this, Noah.

396
00:24:54,096 --> 00:24:59,591
That boy was always a bad egg.
I'm telling you, no good will come of this.

397
00:25:09,244 --> 00:25:11,007
Guys!

398
00:25:12,047 --> 00:25:13,947
Wait up!

399
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,634
What do you think?

400
00:25:39,808 --> 00:25:42,572
- You first.
- No, you first.

401
00:25:43,712 --> 00:25:46,180
No. No, no, no.

402
00:25:50,786 --> 00:25:51,946
Stop pushing!

403
00:25:56,458 --> 00:25:59,825
- What was that?
- I think it was the fuzzball.

404
00:26:04,966 --> 00:26:07,093
See any blood?

405
00:26:10,072 --> 00:26:12,404
What you waiting for?

406
00:27:10,632 --> 00:27:12,224
Hey, Gloria!

407
00:27:12,401 --> 00:27:15,802
Gloria, I adore-ia. I'd like to see more-ia.

408
00:27:15,971 --> 00:27:17,632
Gloria.

409
00:27:36,658 --> 00:27:38,956
- Mumble?
- Gloria.

410
00:27:43,398 --> 00:27:44,922
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

411
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:47,625
Fall back, coming through!

412
00:28:06,188 --> 00:28:10,090
Gloria? All my life,
I've wanted to say that you're so...

413
00:28:10,258 --> 00:28:12,317
- Fish.
- Yeah. You're so fish.

414
00:28:12,494 --> 00:28:14,553
No. Fish!

415
00:28:14,729 --> 00:28:16,594
Fish!

416
00:28:18,033 --> 00:28:19,625
Oh, that's mine.

417
00:28:25,607 --> 00:28:28,542
- That's lousy.
- You didn't get one?

418
00:28:32,347 --> 00:28:33,439
Sorry.

419
00:28:33,615 --> 00:28:34,843
Gloria. You got one?

420
00:28:35,016 --> 00:28:37,484
- Nope. Not this time.
- You have it.

421
00:28:37,652 --> 00:28:40,348
- Thank you, Mumble, but it's yours.
- I want you to have it.

422
00:28:40,522 --> 00:28:43,184
- No. You caught it. You eat it.
- I want you to...

423
00:28:43,358 --> 00:28:45,588
Skua! You get back here!

424
00:28:53,335 --> 00:28:56,896
- Come on.
- Mumble! Let go!

425
00:28:57,072 --> 00:29:00,064
Mumble! Let go!

426
00:29:04,613 --> 00:29:06,774
You just let him get away!

427
00:29:15,557 --> 00:29:18,526
- Is he breathing?
- He's certainly not eating.

428
00:29:18,693 --> 00:29:22,094
Mumble? Are you okay?

429
00:29:22,964 --> 00:29:24,431
Mumble?

430
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,462
Take the fish.

431
00:29:28,637 --> 00:29:31,105
- What?
- Take the stupid fish.

432
00:29:31,273 --> 00:29:33,366
Oh, okay.

433
00:29:43,251 --> 00:29:45,549
Thank you, Mumble.

434
00:29:46,021 --> 00:29:47,955
You're welcome.

435
00:29:48,123 --> 00:29:51,684
<i>- somebody to</i>

- You listen. You know?
- Yeah.

479
00:32:10,632 --> 00:32:11,997
Mumble!

480
00:32:12,167 --> 00:32:15,227
- Who do you think you are?
- Yeah, you're spoiling it for everybody.

481
00:32:15,403 --> 00:32:18,338
- Take a flying leap.
- Yeah, jump in the lake.

482
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:29,446
<i>Where is my baby?</i>

483
00:32:32,153 --> 00:32:37,250
<i>Anybody find me, find me
Find me, find me</i>

484
00:32:37,425 --> 00:32:42,761
<i>Somebody</i>

485
00:33:04,886 --> 00:33:07,548
okay, fellas. Cut it out.

486
00:33:11,259 --> 00:33:14,023
I'm completely terrified.

487
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:16,724
Gloria?

488
00:33:17,766 --> 00:33:19,393
Guys?

489
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:25,135
Get up here or I'll come in after you.

490
00:34:58,633 --> 00:35:00,191
- Safe!
- Oh, yeah!

491
00:35:00,368 --> 00:35:02,563
- You the bomb, bro.
- That's a 9.8.

492
00:35:02,737 --> 00:35:03,965
- I give you 10.
- Why?

493
00:35:06,875 --> 00:35:09,673
Oh, no, no, no. Come on.
Bring it. Bring it on.

494
00:35:09,844 --> 00:35:12,039
- Kiss my frozen tushy.
- Kiss it. Kiss it.

495
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:19,384
Come here, sausage.
I take you with ketchup.

496
00:35:19,554 --> 00:35:22,045
But first you got to catch up.

497
00:35:22,223 --> 00:35:25,215
Oh, here he comes.
You better move in a half an hour.

498
00:35:25,393 --> 00:35:32,356
Let's get out of here.

499
00:35:34,202 --> 00:35:35,863
- Hey, amigo, do that again.
- Do what?

500
00:35:36,037 --> 00:35:38,130
- That thing with the...
- The clickety-clickety.

501
00:35:38,306 --> 00:35:39,295
- That.
- Yeah, do it.

502
00:35:39,474 --> 00:35:43,069
- Come on, come on.
- Well, I just kind of go:

503
00:35:44,679 --> 00:35:45,976
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Oh, nice.

504
00:35:46,147 --> 00:35:48,411
And then this:

505
00:35:52,754 --> 00:35:55,518
Way to go! It's amazing!

506
00:35:58,026 --> 00:36:00,586
- Oh, the little whisker.
- Look at him.

507
00:36:00,762 --> 00:36:04,061
Oh, he's leaving.
Oh, no, that was his face!

508
00:36:04,232 --> 00:36:06,894
Remember, dumplings,
I know where you live.

509
00:36:07,068 --> 00:36:09,002
Yeah, it's called land, lard face.

510
00:36:10,071 --> 00:36:11,698
Flop back anytime, rubber butt!

511
00:36:14,709 --> 00:36:17,041
See you, fatty.

512
00:36:17,211 --> 00:36:19,145
That's cool. "See you, fatty!"

513
00:36:19,314 --> 00:36:22,044
Did it take you a while
to come up with that one?

514
00:36:22,216 --> 00:36:23,877
All right, way to go, tall guy.

515
00:36:24,052 --> 00:36:26,213
Give me fin, give me fin.

516
00:36:27,088 --> 00:36:29,682
<i>To the left, to the right
I'm getting it, oh, yes</i>

517
00:36:29,857 --> 00:36:31,518
<i>Look out, here I go</i>

518
00:36:31,693 --> 00:36:35,891
<i>I got it, I got it, I don't, I had it</i>

519
00:36:36,064 --> 00:36:38,055
oh, my stomach hurts. I gotta pee.

520
00:36:39,334 --> 00:36:41,666
Ain't you coming, tall boy?

521
00:36:42,704 --> 00:36:45,673
What, you got something better to do?

522
00:36:46,874 --> 00:36:50,640
- No.
- Well, then, come along, Fluffy, let's go.

523
00:37:06,494 --> 00:37:09,088
Hey, stretch, you like to party?

524
00:37:09,263 --> 00:37:11,060
Party? I guess so.

525
00:37:11,232 --> 00:37:12,563
Well, stick with us, baby.

526
00:37:12,734 --> 00:37:15,760
Yeah, because we practically
own the action here.

527
00:37:15,937 --> 00:37:17,928
<i>Mambo!</i>

528
00:37:19,874 --> 00:37:22,308
Everybody's so... spontan-you-us.

529
00:37:22,477 --> 00:37:24,172
Spontan-you-us!

530
00:37:24,345 --> 00:37:25,642
And these are the bad times!

531
00:37:25,813 --> 00:37:29,146
- Yeah, our food chain go loco.
- Everyone a bit down.

532
00:37:29,317 --> 00:37:32,047
But it ain't gonna stop no party!

533
00:37:33,521 --> 00:37:35,113
- Viva la party!
- Watch me work.

534
00:37:35,289 --> 00:37:38,258
Gosh, he's eating rocks.

535
00:37:39,027 --> 00:37:42,190
- You hear what he said?
- "Eating rocks. "

536
00:37:42,363 --> 00:37:44,024
But he had a rock in his mouth.

537
00:37:44,198 --> 00:37:47,565
That's no rock, hombre. It's love stones.

538
00:37:47,735 --> 00:37:50,727
- For building the nest.
- The one with the most pebbles wins.

539
00:37:50,905 --> 00:37:53,271
You know:

540
00:37:53,474 --> 00:37:55,465
<i>You're not interested in chicas?</i>

541
00:37:55,643 --> 00:37:56,940
- Hey, hey, hey.
- You kidding?

542
00:37:57,111 --> 00:38:00,103
<i>Without us, the chicas got no boom.</i>

543
00:38:01,015 --> 00:38:03,848
- Why aren't you collecting pebbles?
- Pebbles, schmebbles, man.

544
00:38:04,018 --> 00:38:07,613
We got personality, with a capital Y.
Why? Because we're hot.

545
00:38:07,789 --> 00:38:10,553
Watch and learn, tall boy.

546
00:38:11,192 --> 00:38:13,387
- Hey. Hey, baby.
- Over here, mama. Chicky baby.

547
00:38:13,561 --> 00:38:14,994
- Baby.
- What are you looking at?

548
00:38:15,163 --> 00:38:16,790
- You looking at me?
- Come over here.

549
00:38:16,964 --> 00:38:19,592
<i>- Come on, mamî.
- You see something you like, yes?</i>

550
00:38:19,767 --> 00:38:22,292
I don't think so. Not tonight, baby.

551
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:25,098
Oh, don't be so snooty, booty.

552
00:38:25,273 --> 00:38:28,106
<i>That's the way... you like it, you like it</i>

553
00:38:28,276 --> 00:38:31,177
<i>You want it, I got it
Could've had it, you missed it</i>

554
00:38:31,345 --> 00:38:33,279
Look at the feet, huh?

555
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:37,579
- Where'd you learn that?
- The big guy.

556
00:38:37,752 --> 00:38:39,276
- He from out of town.
- He with us.

557
00:38:39,454 --> 00:38:42,946
- Do it again.
- Do it, baby. Show me those flipping feet.

558
00:38:43,124 --> 00:38:46,787
- No, no, no. Sorry, girls.
- Some other time maybe.

559
00:38:46,961 --> 00:38:49,725
You guys are soft in the head, okay?

560
00:38:50,264 --> 00:38:51,253
Let's go.

561
00:38:51,432 --> 00:38:54,526
- Leave them wanting more, you know?
- Hold back till the season.

562
00:38:54,936 --> 00:38:57,461
- You show them what you got.
- Either you got it or not.

563
00:38:57,638 --> 00:39:00,266
- And the Amigos?
- We got it!

564
00:39:02,143 --> 00:39:03,701
You think I could get some of it?

565
00:39:03,878 --> 00:39:08,679
Hombre, you've got so much already,
you dangerous, baby.

566
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:10,408
You really think so?

567
00:39:10,585 --> 00:39:12,314
You kidding? With moves like yours...

568
00:39:12,487 --> 00:39:14,955
...you must have all the ladies
drooling at your feet.

569
00:39:15,123 --> 00:39:19,287
- I wouldn't say that.
- Oh, listen to him. He's so cute.

570
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:20,950
Let me tell something to you.

571
00:39:21,362 --> 00:39:25,230
Except for me, tall boy,
you got the most charisma of anybody.

572
00:39:25,399 --> 00:39:28,926
Put that ego away, Ramon,
you're gonna hurt someone.

573
00:39:29,103 --> 00:39:33,005
You so jealous. Just a moment.
I hear people wanting something.

574
00:39:33,174 --> 00:39:35,267
Me!

575
00:39:36,377 --> 00:39:38,868
<i>- Mambo
- Okay, you girlies, Mambo</i>

576
00:39:39,046 --> 00:39:42,573
<i>One more time now, mambo
Mambo, mambo, mambo</i>

577
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:44,741
<i>Mambo!</i>

578
00:40:04,906 --> 00:40:08,000
Your turn, your turn.

579
00:40:08,176 --> 00:40:09,905
Oh, get down.

580
00:40:17,752 --> 00:40:20,118
Man, this guy is so accidentally cool.

581
00:40:21,522 --> 00:40:23,114
Okay, okay.

582
00:40:23,291 --> 00:40:24,417
Mama!

583
00:40:37,572 --> 00:40:39,631
Mommy!

584
00:41:01,963 --> 00:41:03,897
Come on, Fluffy.

585
00:41:07,468 --> 00:41:08,492
Oh, I love gravity.

586
00:41:08,669 --> 00:41:12,002
- Oh, I feel like reminiscing.
- Remin-icing?

587
00:42:39,493 --> 00:42:41,427
- It was too close.
- Come on, come on.

588
00:42:43,631 --> 00:42:46,099
Hey, guys! Where are we going?

589
00:42:46,267 --> 00:42:48,394
- We relocating.
- Placing ourselves elsewhere.

590
00:42:48,569 --> 00:42:51,538
- But that thing, what was it?
- How should we know?

591
00:42:51,706 --> 00:42:54,106
- We're penguins.
- Very little penguins.

592
00:42:54,275 --> 00:42:58,234
But where did it come from?
It's so weird, so alien.

593
00:42:58,412 --> 00:43:00,812
- What's he talking about?
- Some hombre called Elian.

594
00:43:00,981 --> 00:43:03,449
I don't know a guy Elian.
I knew a guy named Estevan...

595
00:43:03,617 --> 00:43:05,949
- Not Estevan, Elian.
- Guys, we have a mystery here.

596
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:07,246
A mind-boggling mystery.

597
00:43:07,421 --> 00:43:09,355
So? What are we
supposed to do about it?

598
00:43:09,523 --> 00:43:11,753
Amigos, we gotta get
to the bottom of this thing.

599
00:43:12,593 --> 00:43:17,895
Big guy, let me tell something to you.
Come close. Don't be afraid.

600
00:43:18,065 --> 00:43:19,760
- You want answers?
- Yeah.

601
00:43:19,934 --> 00:43:21,299
- That's all you need?
- Yeah.

602
00:43:21,469 --> 00:43:22,458
- Nothing else?
- No.

603
00:43:22,636 --> 00:43:24,001
Then this is very easy.

604
00:43:24,171 --> 00:43:25,331
You go see Lovelace.

605
00:43:26,474 --> 00:43:28,101
- Lovelace.
- Go see Lovelace.

606
00:43:28,275 --> 00:43:30,266
- Genius, Ramon. You are the man.
- Thank you.

607
00:43:30,444 --> 00:43:32,207
- I take a moment for myself.
- Let's go.

608
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:33,642
- Bow down.
- You the man.

609
00:43:33,814 --> 00:43:36,146
- That's enough, I feel your love.
- Who's Lovelace?

610
00:43:36,317 --> 00:43:38,649
- Lovelace is the guru.
- Go see Lovelace.

611
00:43:38,819 --> 00:43:40,912
- He got the answer to everything.
- Everything.

612
00:43:41,088 --> 00:43:43,181
- Really?
- Ask him, he never wrong.

613
00:43:43,357 --> 00:43:46,622
But first, you gonna need a pebble.

614
00:43:51,031 --> 00:43:54,728
<i>Hold it, y'all. I have a warning
for the audience.</i>

615
00:43:55,569 --> 00:43:58,868
<i>Ladies, please, avert your eyes...</i>

616
00:43:59,039 --> 00:44:02,372
<i>...because I've been known to hypnotize.</i>

617
00:44:03,244 --> 00:44:06,680
<i>You heard the voice,
now you're about to meet...</i>

618
00:44:06,847 --> 00:44:10,874
<i>...the one and only Lovelace,
in the flesh...</i>

619
00:44:11,051 --> 00:44:16,114
<i>...right here, right on, right now.</i>

620
00:44:16,290 --> 00:44:19,623
The devotion, please.

621
00:44:20,327 --> 00:44:21,521
Oh, yeah.

622
00:44:21,695 --> 00:44:24,220
And now, your question.

623
00:44:24,398 --> 00:44:25,831
Señor Lovelace...

624
00:44:26,367 --> 00:44:29,530
...my wife has disappeared. Is she alive?

625
00:44:32,673 --> 00:44:36,439
<i>Is she alive now?
Separate the truth from the jive</i>

626
00:44:36,644 --> 00:44:40,205
<i>Speak to me, oh, mystic beings</i>

627
00:44:42,583 --> 00:44:45,575
Yes! She's happy
and you're in her thoughts.

628
00:44:45,753 --> 00:44:47,482
Is she with another male?

629
00:44:47,655 --> 00:44:50,590
One pebble, one question. Next!

630
00:44:50,758 --> 00:44:53,784
Oh, Serene one.
Please ask the mystic beings...

631
00:44:53,961 --> 00:44:55,553
...will I ever be as rich as you?

632
00:44:56,030 --> 00:44:59,022
In your dreams, Jean. Next!

633
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:01,191
- Go ahead. Go ahead.
- Get up there, big guy.

634
00:45:01,368 --> 00:45:05,236
- That's it. Don't be scared.
- Gentleman, please! One at a time.

635
00:45:05,873 --> 00:45:07,340
- We with him.
- Yeah, we together.

636
00:45:07,508 --> 00:45:09,942
- He got a beautiful question. Go.
- Do it.

637
00:45:10,110 --> 00:45:11,634
Just don't look him in the eye.

638
00:45:11,812 --> 00:45:13,803
Have you ever been abducted by aliens?

639
00:45:14,315 --> 00:45:16,806
Excuse me?
What kind of question is that? Next!

640
00:45:16,984 --> 00:45:17,973
No, wait, señor.

641
00:45:18,152 --> 00:45:22,452
I met a skua once, with something like that
on his foot, said he was abducted by aliens.

642
00:45:22,623 --> 00:45:27,390
This, friend, is my sacred talisman...

643
00:45:28,395 --> 00:45:30,090
<i>Talisman, talisman</i>

644
00:45:30,264 --> 00:45:33,927
...bestowed on me by the mystic beings...

645
00:45:34,101 --> 00:45:36,626
<i>Mystic beings</i>

646
00:45:36,804 --> 00:45:40,706
...during my epic journey
of enlightenment...

647
00:45:41,509 --> 00:45:42,999
...to the forbidden shore.

648
00:45:43,177 --> 00:45:45,475
<i>Forbidden shore</i>

649
00:45:45,646 --> 00:45:47,671
oh, say it one more.

650
00:45:47,848 --> 00:45:51,409
<i>- Forbidden shore
- Oh, yeah</i>

651
00:45:51,585 --> 00:45:53,485
Wait, you saw mystic beings?

652
00:45:53,654 --> 00:45:56,953
I hear them! They speak through me!

653
00:45:57,124 --> 00:45:59,183
Oh, yeah.

654
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:02,352
There's a power that makes me
stand upon this tower!

655
00:46:02,530 --> 00:46:05,556
Did they have front-ways eyes?
Did they probe you? Strap you down?

656
00:46:05,733 --> 00:46:09,134
Enough! "Did they probe me?"

657
00:46:09,303 --> 00:46:12,101
Too many questions!
You don't have enough pebbles, fool.

658
00:46:12,606 --> 00:46:14,471
You haven't answered
any of my questions.

659
00:46:14,642 --> 00:46:18,237
- How many questions he got?
- We've all got stuff to ask!

660
00:46:22,583 --> 00:46:24,175
Enough!

661
00:46:25,686 --> 00:46:28,211
You bring this stranger before me.

662
00:46:28,389 --> 00:46:32,951
He doubts my powers.
He compares me to a skua.

663
00:46:33,327 --> 00:46:35,318
The voices are shrieking in my head.

664
00:46:35,496 --> 00:46:38,397
They say, "Lovelace, who is this fool?

665
00:46:38,832 --> 00:46:44,065
Tell him! Tell him to go forth
and multiply!"

666
00:46:44,305 --> 00:46:45,829
Come to think of it...

667
00:46:46,006 --> 00:46:49,772
...why don't we all go forth and multiply?

668
00:46:49,944 --> 00:46:52,105
- Lovelace.
- What he saying?

669
00:46:52,279 --> 00:46:54,076
- It's mating season.
- Already?

670
00:46:54,248 --> 00:46:58,275
I will retire now
to my couch of perpetual indulgence.

671
00:46:58,452 --> 00:47:00,886
- Okay, ladies, who's first?
- Me!

672
00:47:01,055 --> 00:47:03,819
One at a time. Don't touch the talisman,
baby, please.

673
00:47:03,991 --> 00:47:07,256
Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute.
What about us?

674
00:47:07,428 --> 00:47:10,192
<i>Lovelace, Lovelace, Lovelace!</i>

675
00:47:10,364 --> 00:47:12,127
Hear me!

676
00:47:12,299 --> 00:47:14,324
There's not enough love in the world.

677
00:47:14,501 --> 00:47:16,560
Turn to the penguin next to you.

678
00:47:16,737 --> 00:47:19,137
Put your flippers up.
Fluff him up a little bit.

679
00:47:19,306 --> 00:47:21,774
And give him a great big hug.

680
00:47:21,942 --> 00:47:24,103
Okay, ladies.

681
00:47:24,278 --> 00:47:26,644
Oh, make that little noise again, girl.

682
00:47:28,782 --> 00:47:30,374
Hey, what he got we don't got, man?

683
00:47:30,551 --> 00:47:32,416
- What you hugging me for?
- He told me to.

684
00:47:32,586 --> 00:47:33,814
- Get away.
- No, you like it.

685
00:47:33,988 --> 00:47:35,012
Get off him, Ramon.

686
00:47:35,189 --> 00:47:37,180
Stretch, got any stones
where you come from?

687
00:47:37,358 --> 00:47:39,485
- We don't collect stones.
- You don't? Why not?

688
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:40,649
We live on the ice.

689
00:47:40,828 --> 00:47:42,625
So how you win the heart of the ladies?

690
00:47:42,796 --> 00:47:45,287
Well, we sing.

691
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:49,892
- Stop! That's crazy!
- You're kidding, right?

692
00:47:50,070 --> 00:47:51,901
No. We sing to each other.

693
00:47:52,072 --> 00:47:55,064
If someone special likes your song,
you know...

694
00:47:55,242 --> 00:47:57,073
oh, and you have someone special?

695
00:47:57,244 --> 00:48:00,577
- A tall beauty in your dark romantic past?
- Of which you never speak?

696
00:48:00,748 --> 00:48:01,840
Well, sort of.

697
00:48:02,016 --> 00:48:04,814
Hey, let's go check it out.
Maybe she got some friends.

698
00:48:04,985 --> 00:48:05,974
I like them tall.

699
00:48:06,153 --> 00:48:07,552
It's never gonna work.

700
00:48:07,721 --> 00:48:09,484
- Hey, big guy.
- It's the loving season.

701
00:48:09,657 --> 00:48:11,147
All you gotta do is sing.

702
00:48:11,325 --> 00:48:12,792
That's the problem. I can't.

703
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:15,428
- You a bird, ain't you?
- All birds can sing.

704
00:48:15,596 --> 00:48:17,860
<i>I don't sing like the birdie do</i>

705
00:48:19,099 --> 00:48:20,589
All right.

706
00:48:20,768 --> 00:48:22,326
<i>Find me, find me</i>

707
00:48:22,770 --> 00:48:25,534
What's he doing?

708
00:48:25,706 --> 00:48:28,436
- I think he's singing.
- I know singing, that's not singing.

709
00:48:30,477 --> 00:48:34,004
I heard an animal once do that,
but then they rolled him over, he was dead.

710
00:48:34,515 --> 00:48:38,007
Yeah. And when she sings,
it darn near breaks your heart.

711
00:48:38,185 --> 00:48:39,948
You in tragic shape, man.

712
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:42,281
- Don't worry. We can fix it.
- We can?

713
00:48:42,456 --> 00:48:44,617
- Absolutely. We can. We can.
- We can?

714
00:48:44,792 --> 00:48:47,226
- Really?
- Yes! Let me tell something to you.

715
00:48:47,394 --> 00:48:50,761
- Come close. Closer. You wanna sing?
- Yeah.

716
00:48:50,931 --> 00:48:52,421
- You sure?
- Absolutely.

717
00:48:52,599 --> 00:48:54,999
You making fun of me?
Then this is very easy.

718
00:48:55,169 --> 00:48:58,263
Really? Gosh, if I could sing,
that would change everything.

719
00:48:58,439 --> 00:49:02,637
You will sing. You just got to do
exactly what I say.

720
00:49:02,810 --> 00:49:04,937
- Okay.
- Did I say "okay"?

721
00:49:05,112 --> 00:49:06,602
- No.
- No. What did I say?

722
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:10,307
- Do exactly what you say.
- Exactly what I say.

723
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:18,681
<i>Don't push me
'Cause I'm close to the edge</i>

724
00:49:20,761 --> 00:49:25,027
<i>I'm trying not to lose my...</i>

725
00:49:25,999 --> 00:49:27,557
<i>Gloria</i>

726
00:49:27,735 --> 00:49:29,930
<i>It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder</i>

727
00:49:30,104 --> 00:49:31,332
<i>How I keep from going under</i>

728
00:49:31,505 --> 00:49:35,202

Mumble.

745
00:50:57,424 --> 00:50:59,984
Oh, hi, Gloria.

746
00:51:06,466 --> 00:51:08,093
And this is you?

747
00:51:09,403 --> 00:51:12,395
Sure, it's me. You like?

748
00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:17,840
Well, I would, if it were really you, yeah.

749
00:51:18,946 --> 00:51:20,743
Well, it is me, sort of.

750

Yeah.

751
00:51:22,783 --> 00:51:24,614
Turn around.

- Turn around.
- Why?

753
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:28,579
- Well, why not?
- Well...

754
00:51:31,491 --> 00:51:32,924

- Yeah.

00:51:39,533 --> 00:51:40,591
Hello.

you possibly be thinking?

00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:05,068
<i>Into hearts of men
Who need more than they get</i>

791
00:54:05,245 --> 00:54:07,543
<i>Daylight deals a bad hand</i>

792
00:54:07,714 --> 00:54:12,413
<i>To a penguin who has laid too many bets</i>

793
00:54:12,586 --> 00:54:15,987
<i>The mirror stares you in the face</i>

794
00:54:16,156 --> 00:54:19,353
<i>And says, "Baby... it don't work"</i>

795
00:54:19,526 --> 00:54:23,053
<i>You say your prayers
Though you don't care</i>

796
00:54:23,230 --> 00:54:26,199
<i>You dance and shake the hurt</i>

797
00:54:26,366 --> 00:54:27,731
<i>Dance!</i>

798
00:54:27,901 --> 00:54:28,993
Mumble!

799
00:54:29,169 --> 00:54:33,367
<i>Boogie wonderland</i>

800
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:35,440
<i>Dance, dance, dance</i>

801
00:54:35,609 --> 00:54:36,769
<i>Mumble</i>

802
00:54:36,943 --> 00:54:39,070
<i>Boogie wonderland</i>

803
00:54:39,246 --> 00:54:41,771
<i>Check it out, check it out
Check it out, check it out</i>

804
00:54:43,784 --> 00:54:45,342
<i>My brothers</i>

805
00:54:52,692 --> 00:54:55,593
<i>You look so beautiful to me, baby</i>

806
00:55:05,138 --> 00:55:06,833
- Mumble.
- Hey, Miss viola.

807
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:12,639
<i>- All the love in the world can't be gone
- Mumble!</i>

808
00:55:12,813 --> 00:55:17,773
<i>- All the need to be loved can't be wrong
- Mumble!</i>

809
00:55:17,951 --> 00:55:19,509
Disgraceful!

810
00:55:21,188 --> 00:55:22,917
Who do they think they are?

811
00:55:23,090 --> 00:55:26,685
Where is Noah?
This is getting out of hand.

812
00:55:27,060 --> 00:55:28,652
Go!

813
00:55:32,933 --> 00:55:35,333
Hey, Memphis. It's your boy, Mumble.

814
00:55:35,902 --> 00:55:38,735
- Mumble?
- Mumble?

815
00:55:38,905 --> 00:55:42,397
No, no. No, it's "Mambo. " o!

816
00:55:42,576 --> 00:55:46,034
Baby. They're saying, "Mumble. "

817
00:56:07,434 --> 00:56:08,458
Boogie!

818
00:56:08,735 --> 00:56:09,929
Behold, Noah, look!

819
00:56:10,103 --> 00:56:16,099
This was an omen from the start
and now we have this uprising.

820
00:56:16,276 --> 00:56:19,803
Stop! Stop!

821
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:23,780
Stop this unruly nonsense!

822
00:56:25,952 --> 00:56:28,420
Stop it right now!

823
00:56:29,656 --> 00:56:32,090
A little self-control, if you please!

824
00:56:32,259 --> 00:56:36,958
You bring this disorder, this aberration,
to the very heart of our community.

825
00:56:37,130 --> 00:56:38,392
Have you lost your minds?

826
00:56:38,565 --> 00:56:40,328
- We're just having fun.
- Harmless fun.

827
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:44,732
"Harmless"? It is this kind of backsliding
that has brought the scarcity upon us.

828
00:56:44,905 --> 00:56:47,430
Excuse me, smiley. Can you speak
plain penguin, please?

829
00:56:47,607 --> 00:56:50,269
He thinks the food shortage
has something to do with me.

830
00:56:50,443 --> 00:56:54,106
Do you not understand that we can
only survive here when we're in harmony?

831
00:56:54,281 --> 00:56:57,512
When you and your foreign friends
lead us into your easy ways...

832
00:56:57,684 --> 00:56:59,311
...you offend the Great 'Guin.

833
00:56:59,486 --> 00:57:01,420
You invite him to withhold his bounty.

834
00:57:01,588 --> 00:57:05,183
- He rules the seasons.
- He giveth and he can taketh away.

835
00:57:05,358 --> 00:57:07,849
Wait a minute.
Happy feet can't cause a famine.

836
00:57:08,028 --> 00:57:11,623
If thy kind of pagan display
did not cause it, then what did?

837
00:57:11,798 --> 00:57:14,096
I think it comes from outside.
Way beyond the ice.

838
00:57:14,267 --> 00:57:16,599
There are things out there,
things we don't understand.

839
00:57:16,770 --> 00:57:18,431
- Mysteries.
- Mind-boggling mysteries.

840
00:57:18,605 --> 00:57:20,004
- Mystic beings.
- Yeah, aliens.

841
00:57:20,173 --> 00:57:21,800
- He's mad.
- No, aliens.

842
00:57:21,975 --> 00:57:23,636
- I hear they're smart.
- He's insane.

843
00:57:23,810 --> 00:57:26,438
No, they might be smarter than all of us.
Who knows?

844
00:57:26,613 --> 00:57:29,013
He drove the fish away,
now he's ranting this rubbish!

845
00:57:29,182 --> 00:57:32,447
- Hey, let me tell something to you.
- Don't touch me, you filthy vermin.

846
00:57:32,619 --> 00:57:34,450
- Hey, watch it.
- And so it follows.

847
00:57:34,621 --> 00:57:38,113
Dissent leads to division
and division leads us to doom.

848
00:57:38,291 --> 00:57:41,351
- You, Mumble Happy Feet, must go.
- Hear, hear.

849
00:57:41,528 --> 00:57:43,962
Don't you take one step, sweetheart.

850
00:57:44,130 --> 00:57:47,622
You have as much right to be here
as any of these daffy old fools.

851
00:57:48,468 --> 00:57:51,062
Norma Jean, I'll deal with this.

852
00:57:51,238 --> 00:57:52,705
Pa?

853
00:57:55,075 --> 00:57:58,067
Mumble, you must renounce
your so-called friends...

854
00:57:58,245 --> 00:58:00,270
...your peculiar thoughts,
your strange ways.

855
00:58:00,447 --> 00:58:01,812
- Memphis.
- Lf we are devout...

856
00:58:01,982 --> 00:58:04,109
...sincere in our praise,
the fish will return.

857
00:58:04,284 --> 00:58:07,549
- But, Pa...
- Listen, boy, I was a backslider myself.

858
00:58:07,721 --> 00:58:09,985
I was careless
and now we're paying the price.

859
00:58:10,156 --> 00:58:11,748
What's this got to do with Mumble?

860
00:58:11,925 --> 00:58:14,860
- It's why he is the way he is.
- There's nothing wrong with him!

861
00:58:15,028 --> 00:58:18,088
- Face it, our son's all messed up.
- He's not messed up, hear me?

862
00:58:18,265 --> 00:58:20,233
- Believe me, I know.
- How can you say that?

863
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:23,494
Because when he was just an egg,
I dropped him!

864
00:58:23,670 --> 00:58:25,433
Memphis.

865
00:58:27,274 --> 00:58:28,832
Mumble.

866
00:58:31,144 --> 00:58:33,704
Oh, my poor little Mumble.

867
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:35,541
But, Mom, I'm perfectly fine.

868
00:58:35,715 --> 00:58:37,706
- No. No, you're not, boy.
- That's right.

869
00:58:37,884 --> 00:58:41,445
For all our sakes, you must stop
this freakiness with the feet.

870
00:58:41,621 --> 00:58:45,751
Your father speaks wisely.
Heed his suffering heart and repent.

871
00:58:45,925 --> 00:58:48,120
But it just doesn't make any sense.

872
00:58:48,295 --> 00:58:50,354
Then your arrogance leaves us no choice!

873
00:58:50,530 --> 00:58:51,519
No, wait.

874
00:58:52,532 --> 00:58:56,798
Please, son, you can do this.
It ain't so hard.

875
00:58:58,738 --> 00:59:02,401
Don't ask me to change, Pa,
because I can't.

876
00:59:06,922 --> 00:59:10,824
And that, my brethren, is the end of it.

877
00:59:10,993 --> 00:59:12,893
You, begone!

878
00:59:15,831 --> 00:59:19,130
- Mumble.
- No, Ma, it's okay. It's okay.

879
00:59:20,369 --> 00:59:23,031
Let me tell something to you.

880
00:59:23,205 --> 00:59:25,332
When I find out
what's happening to the fish...

881
00:59:26,208 --> 00:59:28,005
...I'll be back.

882
00:59:28,844 --> 00:59:30,471
Let me through? Let me through.

883
00:59:30,646 --> 00:59:32,739
- Mumble, you don't have to go.
- Let it be.

884
00:59:32,915 --> 00:59:35,383
- Gloria.
- No. No, Dad, this isn't fair.

885
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:37,781
Gloria, listen to your father.

886
00:59:38,287 --> 00:59:43,850
<i>My folks were always putting him down</i>

887
00:59:44,026 --> 00:59:46,893
<i>Down, down, down</i>

888
00:59:47,062 --> 00:59:51,328
<i>They said he came
From the wrong side of town</i>

889
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:54,992
<i>He came from the wrong side of town</i>

890
00:59:55,170 --> 00:59:58,264
<i>They told me he was bad</i>

891
00:59:58,440 --> 00:59:59,532
<i>So bad</i>

892
00:59:59,708 --> 01:00:03,644
<i>- But I know he was sad
- So sad</i>

893
01:00:03,812 --> 01:00:08,977
<i>I'll never forget him
The leader of the pack</i>

894
01:00:09,151 --> 01:00:12,985
We sing the heart
of our true friend, Mumble.

895
01:00:13,155 --> 01:00:19,151
<i>You are a nation of peeny-weeny,
piffling, piccolini, piddly-diddly pouft!</i>

896
01:00:20,395 --> 01:00:22,295
Together, we prevail.

897
01:00:22,464 --> 01:00:24,329
In the wisdoms, we trust.

898
01:00:24,499 --> 01:00:26,433
We trust.

899
01:00:28,570 --> 01:00:31,403
<i>Look out</i>

900
01:00:31,573 --> 01:00:36,101
<i>Look out</i>

901
01:00:36,912 --> 01:00:39,881
<i>Look out</i>

902
01:00:40,048 --> 01:00:44,678
<i>Look</i>

903
01:00:44,853 --> 01:00:48,949
<i>Look out</i>

904
01:00:52,628 --> 01:00:56,826
Don't worry, tall guy.
My father also called me a pitiful loser.

905
01:00:56,999 --> 01:00:58,125
Look how I turn out.

906
01:00:58,300 --> 01:00:59,494
You're not helping, Ramon.

907
01:00:59,668 --> 01:01:03,365
He gonna be okay. All he gotta do
is find out what happened to the fish.

908
01:01:03,538 --> 01:01:05,506
- How he gonna do that?
- He think of something.

909
01:01:05,674 --> 01:01:07,665
- The aliens.
- What?

910
01:01:07,843 --> 01:01:10,676
- I'm gonna talk to the aliens.
- How you gonna find aliens?

911
01:01:10,846 --> 01:01:13,406
- Lovelace.
- He don't like you. He don't like you at all.

912
01:01:13,582 --> 01:01:15,675
That's okay. I'll appeal
to his better nature.

913
01:01:15,851 --> 01:01:18,319
- How you gonna do that?
- Cruel and unusual punishment?

914
01:01:18,487 --> 01:01:20,978
- Unimaginable torture?
- Imaginable torture?

915
01:01:21,156 --> 01:01:23,351
- Your singing?
- No!

916
01:01:23,525 --> 01:01:25,857
<i>"Can anybody find me"...</i>

917
01:01:26,261 --> 01:01:28,923
- You're cracking the ice!
- Avalanche!

918
01:01:29,097 --> 01:01:30,758
Yes, okay. Thank you.

919
01:01:41,176 --> 01:01:44,077
Lovelace. You there?

920
01:01:44,246 --> 01:01:46,373
Lovelace!

921
01:01:49,251 --> 01:01:51,048
Lovelace.

922
01:01:56,091 --> 01:01:57,718
Lovelace?

923
01:01:57,893 --> 01:01:59,224
Is this a bad time?

924
01:01:59,394 --> 01:02:01,328
I know we don't have
an appointment, but...

925
01:02:01,496 --> 01:02:03,623
Just one question and
I want a straight answer.

926
01:02:03,799 --> 01:02:05,391
Where do I find the mystic beings?

927
01:02:08,236 --> 01:02:10,227
Why don't he speak?

928
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:14,868
Lovelace, you okay?

929
01:02:16,345 --> 01:02:19,542
- Boy, he's possessed.
- It's a seizure! It's a seizure!

930
01:02:19,715 --> 01:02:21,182
- Open the beak.
- Grab his tongue.

931
01:02:21,350 --> 01:02:23,944
He's choking. That thing
around his neck, it's too tight.

932
01:02:24,119 --> 01:02:26,747
- Well, why didn't you say so?
- On three.

933
01:02:26,922 --> 01:02:31,188
Stop! Listen! No! Amigos! Amigos! Stop!

934
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:33,351
- What?
- You're hurting him.

935
01:02:35,430 --> 01:02:36,897
Any better?

936
01:02:37,065 --> 01:02:39,590
Lovelace, how did you get
that thing around your neck?

937
01:02:39,768 --> 01:02:43,101
- It was bestowed on him.
- By the mystic beings.

938
01:02:43,271 --> 01:02:45,432
- They didn't bestow it?
- No.

939
01:02:45,607 --> 01:02:48,599
Oh, come on, he don't know
what he's saying.

940
01:02:48,777 --> 01:02:51,769
You were swimming
and it just got caught around your neck.

941
01:02:51,947 --> 01:02:54,848
Oh, no way. He the guru.

942
01:02:55,851 --> 01:02:59,048
Lovelace, did you ever actually meet
a mystic being?

943
01:02:59,788 --> 01:03:01,415
Officially?

944
01:03:02,891 --> 01:03:03,880
No.

945
01:03:04,059 --> 01:03:05,993
I knew it! It's all a lie.

946
01:03:06,161 --> 01:03:08,026
But this belongs to someone.

947
01:03:08,196 --> 01:03:10,892
If we could find them,
I bet you they could take it off.

948
01:03:11,299 --> 01:03:15,531
Show me where you found it. I'm sure
they could help us. You and me both.

949
01:03:18,373 --> 01:03:20,273
Two words, three syllables.

950
01:03:20,442 --> 01:03:22,239
- What is it?
- You're dying?

951
01:03:22,411 --> 01:03:26,108
No, no, wait. Past, past, your past life.

952
01:03:26,281 --> 01:03:27,873
You're passing gas.

953
01:03:29,284 --> 01:03:31,275
Now he thinks he's an elephant seal.

954
01:03:31,453 --> 01:03:33,387
No, no, no. Go over the mountains.

955
01:03:33,555 --> 01:03:36,490
- Go over the mountains!
- Through the land of the elephant seals.

956
01:03:36,658 --> 01:03:41,254
- Beyond the land of the elephant seals.
- Beyond the land of the elephant seals!

957
01:03:52,207 --> 01:03:54,368
- Wait.
- What?

958
01:03:55,277 --> 01:03:57,268
I hear voices.

959
01:03:57,446 --> 01:03:59,107
- There is a voice.
- Where?

960
01:03:59,281 --> 01:04:02,842
- There's a little voice on the wind.
- Mumble!

961
01:04:03,018 --> 01:04:04,315
- "Mambo"?
- "Mambo"?

962
01:04:04,486 --> 01:04:05,919
- Listen.
- Mumble Happy Feet.

963
01:04:06,455 --> 01:04:07,683
- Gloria?
- Gloria!

964
01:04:07,856 --> 01:04:08,845
Gloria?

965
01:04:09,024 --> 01:04:11,549
Hey, you got a stalker.
She's obsessed with you, man.

966
01:04:15,163 --> 01:04:17,631
I can't believe it's you.

967
01:04:17,799 --> 01:04:19,858
Of course it's me.

968
01:04:21,169 --> 01:04:22,864
What are you doing here?

969
01:04:23,038 --> 01:04:26,235
<i>All the love in the world can't be gone</i>

970
01:04:26,408 --> 01:04:30,276
<i>All the need to be loved can't be wrong</i>

971
01:04:30,445 --> 01:04:33,175
- oh, my.
- So which way, twinkletoes?

972
01:04:33,348 --> 01:04:36,715
No, no, no. If you come,
you may never get back home.

973
01:04:36,885 --> 01:04:38,250
Fine by me.

974
01:04:38,420 --> 01:04:43,881
Gloria, you have a life back there.
I don't. I mean, we don't. Not out here.

975
01:04:44,059 --> 01:04:47,153
How can we keep an egg safe?
That's if we ever had an egg.

976
01:04:47,329 --> 01:04:49,923
Well, I don't need an egg to be happy.

977
01:04:50,098 --> 01:04:54,125
You say that now, but what about later
when all your friends have eggs?

978
01:04:55,504 --> 01:04:56,732
Then I'll have you.

979
01:04:58,173 --> 01:05:01,574
Now he's going to pledge
his soul forever.

980
01:05:01,743 --> 01:05:02,869
- Gloria.
- Here it comes.

981
01:05:03,044 --> 01:05:09,973
I'm a particular kind of guy,
the kind of guy who needs his own space.

982
01:05:10,252 --> 01:05:12,117
It's not you, it's me.

983
01:05:12,287 --> 01:05:14,721
I'm just not up for a serious relationship
right now.

984
01:05:14,890 --> 01:05:18,223
What he's trying to do now
is he's pushing her away. Let's watch.

985
01:05:18,393 --> 01:05:21,885
No matter what you say or do,
you're stuck with me.

986
01:05:22,063 --> 01:05:25,157
Oh, come on. As if you're not
totally thrilled that I'm here.

987
01:05:25,333 --> 01:05:28,791
- Now she got him on the ropes.
- See, right there is your problem.

988
01:05:28,970 --> 01:05:30,870
You think you're irresistible, don't you?

989
01:05:31,039 --> 01:05:33,371
I don't care where you're from,
that's got to hurt.

990
01:05:33,542 --> 01:05:36,272
- Excuse me?
- Gloria's so gorgeous, Gloria's so talented.

991
01:05:36,444 --> 01:05:37,433
What?

992
01:05:37,612 --> 01:05:40,012
Just because
you can hit a few high notes.

993
01:05:40,182 --> 01:05:42,309
You got a problem with my singing?

994
01:05:42,484 --> 01:05:44,714
No, it's perfectly fine.

995
01:05:44,886 --> 01:05:46,751
- "Fine"?
- Lf you like that sort of thing.

996
01:05:46,922 --> 01:05:49,516
- It's a little Nana Tootsie for my taste.
- What?

997
01:05:49,691 --> 01:05:51,818
You know, showy, flashy, froufrou.

998
01:05:51,993 --> 01:05:53,483
- "Froufrou"?
- That's right.

999
01:05:53,662 --> 01:05:57,792
Coming from someone who thinks it's cool
to jig up and down really fast on the spot...

1000
01:05:57,966 --> 01:06:00,230
...like some twitchy idiot.

1001
01:06:04,005 --> 01:06:06,633
You stubborn, hippity-hoppity fool!

1002
01:06:06,808 --> 01:06:08,673
Right back at you.

1003
01:06:19,020 --> 01:06:21,511
Amigo, that was a good thing you do.

1004
01:06:21,690 --> 01:06:23,954
She is going to be so much better off
without you.

1005
01:06:24,125 --> 01:06:27,253
She is going to find a good, steady guy
to comfort her...

1006
01:06:27,429 --> 01:06:30,626
...and love her up real good
and raise a big family.

1007
01:06:30,799 --> 01:06:33,029
- Ramon.
- And then she's going to let herself go...

1008
01:06:33,201 --> 01:06:36,329
Ramon. He's hurting. He's hurting bad.

1009
01:06:36,504 --> 01:06:41,168
Oh, listen, listen, don't hold it in
or you explode. You got to let it out.

1010
01:06:41,343 --> 01:06:44,039
You just let it out. You let it out.

1011
01:06:44,212 --> 01:06:47,079
Everybody, turn away for a moment.

1012
01:06:47,249 --> 01:06:49,547
<i>If she leave him now</i>

1013
01:06:49,718 --> 01:06:54,917
<i>She take away the biggest part of him</i>

1014
01:06:57,292 --> 01:06:59,226
<i>Don't, baby, please, don't go</i>

1015
01:06:59,394 --> 01:07:01,259
Please, guys.

1016
01:07:01,429 --> 01:07:03,420
No more singing.

1017
01:07:14,209 --> 01:07:16,871
Then she say to me, "Enough,
you are making me nauseous. "

1018
01:07:17,045 --> 01:07:20,776
So I become silent, almost moody,
and you know what she says?

1019
01:07:20,949 --> 01:07:23,008
"You never share. You got to let it out. "

1020
01:07:23,184 --> 01:07:25,948
- Ramon, come on.
- Let it out. Let it out.

1021
01:07:26,121 --> 01:07:27,554
Stop it! Let it go.

1022
01:07:27,722 --> 01:07:31,385
- I never had a good relationship in my life.
- Give him a hug. Give him a hug.

1023
01:07:31,559 --> 01:07:32,787
- I let it out!
- There we go.

1024
01:07:32,961 --> 01:07:35,521
- I let it out.
- I know. Get over it.

1025
01:07:35,697 --> 01:07:38,495
- Can you keep going?
- Yeah.

1026
01:07:38,667 --> 01:07:41,864
- What's that smell?
- It wasn't me.

1027
01:07:43,004 --> 01:07:46,770
Hey, Fluffy, we're following you.
Get up here.

1028
01:07:54,916 --> 01:07:58,977
So these elephant seals,
they're not penguin eaters, are they?

1029
01:07:59,154 --> 01:08:01,554
I don't know.
I believe they are herbivores.

1030
01:08:01,723 --> 01:08:03,588
- What?
- You know, kelp-suckers.

1031
01:08:03,758 --> 01:08:06,090
Here we go, Lovelace. Come on.

1032
01:08:07,762 --> 01:08:09,627
Jump in time. Jump in time.

1033
01:08:09,798 --> 01:08:12,562
- Okay, let's do it.
- Okay, okay, okay. Ready?

1034
01:08:15,770 --> 01:08:18,170
I can do this. I can do this.
I got to trick myself.

1035
01:08:18,340 --> 01:08:20,240
Boy, look at that. What?

1036
01:08:36,191 --> 01:08:40,753
You blokes better be lost,
because trespassing's a crime.

1037
01:08:40,929 --> 01:08:44,922
- We're just passing through.
- Yeah. We're with him.

1038
01:08:45,533 --> 01:08:48,001
You wouldn't be heading
over them distant hills...

1039
01:08:48,169 --> 01:08:50,103
...and through the blizzard country?

1040
01:08:50,271 --> 01:08:53,069
If it's the only way
to the forbidden shore, yeah.

1041
01:08:53,241 --> 01:08:54,435
Crikey.

1042
01:08:54,609 --> 01:08:58,101
You might come face to face
with an annihilator.

1043
01:08:58,279 --> 01:08:59,303
An alien annihilator?

1044
01:08:59,481 --> 01:09:02,416
Too right. Cut you up
as soon as look at you.

1045
01:09:02,584 --> 01:09:05,610
Waste every living thing in their path.

1046
01:09:05,787 --> 01:09:07,448
Could they be annihilating the fish?

1047
01:09:07,622 --> 01:09:09,214
Every living thing.

1048
01:09:09,391 --> 01:09:11,859
Merciless, mate. Merciless.

1049
01:09:12,026 --> 01:09:14,324
Even if you're a whopping great whale...

1050
01:09:14,496 --> 01:09:17,158
...they drag your sorry carcass ashore...

1051
01:09:17,332 --> 01:09:23,032
...dice you up, melt you down,
and turn you into fun food.

1052
01:09:23,204 --> 01:09:25,468
One day you're a big old whale...

1053
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:27,938
...next minute...

1054
01:09:28,109 --> 01:09:29,508
...fun food.

1055
01:09:29,677 --> 01:09:31,110
Someone's gotta stop them.

1056
01:09:31,279 --> 01:09:33,770
Oh, yeah? What's gonna be
your approach?

1057
01:09:33,948 --> 01:09:35,973
If I could just talk to them.

1058
01:09:36,151 --> 01:09:37,641
Appeal to their better nature.

1059
01:09:37,819 --> 01:09:38,808
Beauty.

1060
01:09:38,987 --> 01:09:44,584
When that crafty little trick pays off,
you be sure to let us know, won't you?

1061
01:09:44,759 --> 01:09:47,626
All right, Lovelace, let's go.

1062
01:09:49,864 --> 01:09:51,957
See you, Lovelace.

1063
01:09:54,402 --> 01:09:56,836
Your funeral, mate.

1064
01:10:44,652 --> 01:10:47,212
Oh, man!

1065
01:10:48,256 --> 01:10:50,986
- Push tight.
- Okay.

1066
01:11:05,640 --> 01:11:07,801
Come on, guys. Let's do it.

1067
01:11:07,976 --> 01:11:11,878
You can do it. Come on, push!

1068
01:11:56,124 --> 01:11:58,149
What's that noise?

1069
01:11:59,694 --> 01:12:00,888
There's no noise.

1070
01:12:01,062 --> 01:12:03,622
- No gasping. No wheezing.
- Where's Lovelace?

1071
01:12:05,700 --> 01:12:10,467
Sometimes a brave penguin
will just slip away to die.

1072
01:12:10,638 --> 01:12:12,572
Do you think he went to a happy place?

1073
01:12:12,740 --> 01:12:16,335
- Probably.
- No, no. I think he went this way.

1074
01:12:28,389 --> 01:12:30,880
Come on. Let's go.

1075
01:12:47,475 --> 01:12:49,375
Lovelace!

1076
01:12:50,545 --> 01:12:53,036
Lovelace!

1077
01:12:59,087 --> 01:13:00,918
Hello?

1078
01:13:02,323 --> 01:13:03,722
Is there anyone there?

1079
01:13:03,891 --> 01:13:07,486
- No... No need to shout.
- Somebody might hear you.

1080
01:13:13,134 --> 01:13:14,897
His feet don't look too good.

1081
01:13:15,069 --> 01:13:17,663
- He rested here.
- Now he's on his belly!

1082
01:13:17,839 --> 01:13:20,399
- No, this way.
- You don't want to know what he did here.

1083
01:13:20,575 --> 01:13:22,805
- You're right.
- There he is. Lovelace!

1084
01:13:22,977 --> 01:13:26,276
- All right! Lovelace!
- Lovelace!

1085
01:13:29,050 --> 01:13:30,813
- Oh, look at Lovelace.
- We're here.

1086
01:13:30,985 --> 01:13:34,546
- Are you okay?
- Come on, man. Hang in there, buddy.

1087
01:13:35,423 --> 01:13:37,050
What is it?

1088
01:13:37,225 --> 01:13:40,490
Oh, look. There's one for everyone.

1089
01:13:40,662 --> 01:13:43,187
Hang in there, Lovelace.
I know they're here somewhere.

1090
01:13:43,364 --> 01:13:45,889
- Why would they leave all this behind?
- I don't know.

1091
01:13:46,901 --> 01:13:47,890
Hey.

1092
01:13:48,069 --> 01:13:50,333
- Tell them we come in peace.
- We come in peace!

1093
01:13:50,505 --> 01:13:52,029
- Lovelace.
- Lovelace.

1094
01:13:52,206 --> 01:13:53,673
- Lovelace.
- Oh, buddy, come on.

1095
01:13:53,841 --> 01:13:55,900
- Are you okay?
- Hang in there, buddy.

1096
01:13:58,513 --> 01:14:00,981
- Oh, that's not good.
- Stay calm.

1097
01:14:01,149 --> 01:14:02,446
- Stay calm.
- That's not good.

1098
01:14:02,617 --> 01:14:05,211
- Okay, don't stay calm!
- Panic!

1099
01:14:11,926 --> 01:14:13,894
Oh, no, no!

1100
01:14:15,930 --> 01:14:19,024
- Oh, they're making us appe-teasers.
- They're appe-teasing us!

1101
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:21,327
We're all gonna die.

1102
01:14:22,603 --> 01:14:24,468
Whatever you do, stay out of the water!

1103
01:14:24,639 --> 01:14:26,766
- Stay out of the water.
- Don't go in the water!

1104
01:14:26,941 --> 01:14:29,637
Lovelace, don't go in the water!

1105
01:14:35,483 --> 01:14:37,007
Lovelace, hang in there!

1106
01:14:37,185 --> 01:14:39,085
Hang in there!

1107
01:14:40,455 --> 01:14:43,447
Get your dirty tongue off him!

1108
01:14:45,860 --> 01:14:47,760
No, no, no!

1109
01:14:47,929 --> 01:14:49,396
Stay out of the water!

1110
01:14:49,564 --> 01:14:51,259
- Mumble!
- Mumble!

1111
01:15:21,529 --> 01:15:26,125
- They playing birdminton?
- No, it's a show. Dinner and a show.

1112
01:15:29,771 --> 01:15:32,331
Lovelace!

1113
01:15:37,845 --> 01:15:39,836
Rejoice!

1114
01:15:48,256 --> 01:15:49,450
Lovelace!

1115
01:15:49,624 --> 01:15:51,683
- Help!
- Reach out!

1116
01:15:51,859 --> 01:15:53,690
Thank you, my brother, thank you!

1117
01:16:04,672 --> 01:16:06,537
I wasn't scared! I wasn't scared!

1118
01:16:07,341 --> 01:16:11,277
Oh, my beautiful brother, thank you,
thank you, thank you, thank you!

1119
01:16:15,449 --> 01:16:18,418
- Go, Lovelace! You the man!
- Go, go, go, go, go!

1120
01:16:18,586 --> 01:16:21,054
Enough!

1121
01:16:21,222 --> 01:16:23,315
It's a bad day for you!

1122
01:16:23,491 --> 01:16:25,550
You dealing with Lovelace now!

1123
01:16:25,726 --> 01:16:28,388
- And my man, Mumble, here.
- You tell them, Lovelace.

1124
01:16:28,563 --> 01:16:31,327
Begone, demon fish. Adios.

1125
01:16:32,733 --> 01:16:34,360
That's right.

1126
01:16:34,535 --> 01:16:36,298
You hightail it back to your mamas.

1127
01:16:36,604 --> 01:16:38,663
- How did he do that?
- Don't make me come in the water.

1128
01:16:38,840 --> 01:16:40,774
I'll come after your sons and daughters.

1129
01:16:40,942 --> 01:16:42,933
I'm gonna give you the bad eye.

1130
01:17:37,231 --> 01:17:38,562
A whole bunch of them.

1131
01:17:38,733 --> 01:17:41,361
They gonna rule the world.

1132
01:17:41,535 --> 01:17:42,524
It's gotta be them.

1133
01:17:42,703 --> 01:17:45,968
- Lf it is, I don't wanna know about it.
- They don't even know we exist.

1134
01:17:46,140 --> 01:17:47,471
Let me tell something to you.

1135
01:17:47,642 --> 01:17:50,634
This is the end of the road. It's over.

1136
01:17:50,811 --> 01:17:53,712
You did everything penguinly possible.

1137
01:17:53,881 --> 01:17:56,349
- You found the aliens.
- We gonna testify to that.

1138
01:17:56,517 --> 01:17:59,884
We'll tell your whole laughing-boy nation
they were dead wrong about you.

1139
01:18:00,054 --> 01:18:01,851
Now, let's all go back home. Right now.

1140
01:18:02,023 --> 01:18:03,388
Right on.

1141
01:18:03,557 --> 01:18:05,149
- Could I ask a favor of you?
- Sure.

1142
01:18:05,326 --> 01:18:07,886
- What kind of favor?
- Could you make sure Gloria's okay?

1143
01:18:08,062 --> 01:18:09,427
- And my ma.
- What?

1144
01:18:09,597 --> 01:18:11,189
And if you see Pa...

1145
01:18:11,365 --> 01:18:14,232
...tell him I tried.

1146
01:18:14,402 --> 01:18:15,892
Okay, what you talking about?

1147
01:18:16,070 --> 01:18:17,833
I'm gonna stop them taking our fish.

1148
01:18:18,005 --> 01:18:19,563
How you gonna do that, Mumble?

1149
01:18:21,943 --> 01:18:25,003
Adios, amigos!

1150
01:18:25,346 --> 01:18:26,836
Amigo! He did it.

1151
01:18:50,404 --> 01:18:51,428
You believe that?

1152
01:18:51,605 --> 01:18:55,166
How we gonna tell his mama
he bring us all this way just to kill himself?

1153
01:18:55,343 --> 01:18:58,107
No. He didn't. Look.

1154
01:18:58,946 --> 01:19:00,709
He loco maniac.

1155
01:19:00,881 --> 01:19:03,816
First ever flying flipper bird.

1156
01:19:03,985 --> 01:19:06,146
How tall you think that tall boy was?

1157
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:09,483
Who could say? Taller than anyone.

1158
01:19:09,657 --> 01:19:13,593
Hey, it's me, Lovelace...

1159
01:19:13,761 --> 01:19:16,161
...formerly known as "guru. "

1160
01:19:16,330 --> 01:19:19,322
I'm gonna be telling your story,
Happy Feet...

1161
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:23,368
...long after you dead and gone!

1162
01:19:40,388 --> 01:19:42,652
Hey! Hey!

1163
01:20:32,807 --> 01:20:35,503
<i>Enraged by their indifference...</i>

1164
01:20:35,676 --> 01:20:41,012
<i>...he followed them long after
they were gone from his sight.</i>

1165
01:20:43,184 --> 01:20:47,416
<i>He ventured further
than any of us had gone before...</i>

1166
01:20:47,588 --> 01:20:51,422
<i>...beyond all hope of return.</i>

1167
01:20:52,359 --> 01:20:54,793
<i>Swept up by the great currents...</i>

1168
01:20:54,962 --> 01:20:59,626
<i>...he was carried endlessly
across vast oceans...</i>

1169
01:20:59,800 --> 01:21:03,497
<i>...to worlds unknown.</i>

1170
01:21:59,793 --> 01:22:02,557
Excuse me. What is this place?

1171
01:22:02,730 --> 01:22:05,722
You're in heaven, Dave. Penguin heaven.

1172
01:22:05,900 --> 01:22:07,891
Is it anywhere near Emperor Land?

1173
01:22:08,068 --> 01:22:10,866
It's wherever you want it to be.

1174
01:22:11,705 --> 01:22:15,732
Try the water, Dave. It's really real.

1175
01:22:31,825 --> 01:22:36,194
<i>I heard tell,
when he finally saw aliens up close...</i>

1176
01:22:36,363 --> 01:22:40,561
<i>...they were just as the skua
had described.</i>

1177
01:22:40,734 --> 01:22:43,362
Excuse me. Why are you taking our fish?

1178
01:22:43,537 --> 01:22:48,839
<i>Big, ugly penguins without feathers
on their fat, flabby faces.</i>

1179
01:22:49,009 --> 01:22:54,743
Why are you taking our fish?
You're kind of killing us out there.

1180
01:22:57,117 --> 01:22:59,210
No! No, wait!

1181
01:23:08,829 --> 01:23:10,797
Oh, my.

1182
01:23:11,865 --> 01:23:16,029
Hello. Hello from Emperor Land.
Good afternoon.

1183
01:23:16,203 --> 01:23:17,966
Why are you taking our fish?

1184
01:23:18,138 --> 01:23:22,575
I'm sure you don't mean to,
but you're causing an awful lot of grief.

1185
01:23:23,577 --> 01:23:27,570
Am I not making myself clear?
I'm speaking plain penguin.

1186
01:23:28,482 --> 01:23:32,043
Penguin! Don't you understand?
You're stealing our fish.

1187
01:23:36,323 --> 01:23:39,053
Oh, please, anyone, talk to me!

1188
01:23:39,226 --> 01:23:41,456
For pity's sake, you're stealing our F-I-S...

1189
01:23:46,233 --> 01:23:51,000
<i>After three days, he would lose his voice.</i>

1190
01:23:51,171 --> 01:23:53,605
<i>After three months...</i>

1191
01:23:55,576 --> 01:23:59,706
<i>...he would all but lose his mind.</i>

1192
01:24:12,126 --> 01:24:15,095
So you found the fish, baby.

1193
01:24:16,196 --> 01:24:17,857
Ma?

1194
01:24:18,032 --> 01:24:19,329
- Hi, sweetie.
- Ma.

1195
01:24:19,500 --> 01:24:23,903
Fluffy, no matter what they say or do,
we never stopped believing in you.

1196
01:24:24,071 --> 01:24:26,164
So you'll be back soon, right?

1197
01:24:26,340 --> 01:24:27,967
Hey, come on. Let him eat.

1198
01:24:28,142 --> 01:24:30,133
Go ahead, Dave. Don't mind us.

1199
01:24:30,644 --> 01:24:32,111
But there's plenty for everyone.

1200
01:24:32,279 --> 01:24:34,577
It's okay, sugar. We can wait.

1201
01:24:34,748 --> 01:24:36,579
No, no, Ma! Ma!

1202
01:24:36,750 --> 01:24:40,151
There's lots here. Ma!

1203
01:24:44,091 --> 01:24:45,683
Ma!

1204
01:27:05,899 --> 01:27:08,595
- Kids, you gotta see this.
- He's on now.

1205
01:27:30,357 --> 01:27:32,723
Hey! Hello!

1206
01:27:35,162 --> 01:27:37,722
- Isn't that the fellow with the wacky feet?
- Looks like.

1207
01:27:37,898 --> 01:27:40,196
- What was his name?
- I thought he was dead.

1208
01:27:40,367 --> 01:27:41,766
- Everybody...
- Apparently not.

1209
01:27:41,935 --> 01:27:44,870
Everybody, listen up! I've got big news.

1210
01:27:45,205 --> 01:27:47,196
I know who's taking the fish!

1211
01:27:47,374 --> 01:27:49,842
- Yeah, and they took his brain.
- It's the aliens.

1212
01:27:50,010 --> 01:27:52,274
- I made contact with them.
- The lunatic is back.

1213
01:27:52,446 --> 01:27:54,437
The aliens are taking our fish.

1214
01:27:54,615 --> 01:27:56,674
Someone ought to fetch
Noah and the elders.

1215
01:27:56,850 --> 01:27:58,147
Hey, you.

1216
01:27:58,719 --> 01:28:00,277
Gloria.

1217
01:28:00,454 --> 01:28:02,547
Kind of weird, seeing you again.

1218
01:28:03,056 --> 01:28:04,045
Yeah.

1219
01:28:04,224 --> 01:28:06,590
- Everything cool here, baby?
- You remember Seymour.

1220
01:28:06,760 --> 01:28:08,057
Yeah. Hi, Seymour.

1221
01:28:08,228 --> 01:28:09,718
Yeah.

1222
01:28:11,031 --> 01:28:12,760
So which one is yours?

1223
01:28:14,001 --> 01:28:15,263
All of them.

1224
01:28:17,638 --> 01:28:21,768
This is our singing class.
He teaches rhythm. I teach the blues.

1225
01:28:21,942 --> 01:28:24,536
- So you're not...?
- I guess I never heard the right song.

1226
01:28:24,711 --> 01:28:27,839
That's great! I didn't mean...

1227
01:28:28,181 --> 01:28:29,773
I found out who's taking the fish.

1228
01:28:29,950 --> 01:28:32,077
They're big and kind of ugly,
but, Gloria...

1229
01:28:32,252 --> 01:28:34,550
...the things they can do.
They're coming here.

1230
01:28:34,721 --> 01:28:35,847
Oh, is that so?

1231
01:28:36,023 --> 01:28:38,423
They'll be here soon.
I think they wanna help us.

1232
01:28:38,592 --> 01:28:40,321
So now you speak with them?

1233
01:28:40,494 --> 01:28:43,691
Well, they don't speak penguin,
but they seem to respond to this.

1234
01:28:43,864 --> 01:28:45,923
- What's he doing?
- You gotta be kidding me.

1235
01:28:46,099 --> 01:28:49,125
I suggest we all do it.
It really gets their attention.

1236
01:28:49,303 --> 01:28:50,634
And why would it do that?

1237
01:28:50,804 --> 01:28:53,705
Beats me, but it works.

1238
01:28:53,874 --> 01:28:56,741
- Hey, it's the hippity-hopper.
- Freaky feet!

1239
01:28:56,910 --> 01:28:57,899
Boys, boys...

1240
01:28:58,078 --> 01:28:59,067
- Fluffy.
- Tall guy.

1241
01:28:59,246 --> 01:29:01,237
- Stretch!
- Amigo!

1242
01:29:04,851 --> 01:29:07,718
So you dare come back?

1243
01:29:08,021 --> 01:29:10,615
He says he's found aliens
and they're taking our fish.

1244
01:29:10,791 --> 01:29:13,316
He says that they're coming
and we all have to do this.

1245
01:29:14,795 --> 01:29:18,322
There be no such thing as aliens!

1246
01:29:20,434 --> 01:29:23,164
Mumble, turn around.

1247
01:29:26,306 --> 01:29:27,796
It's a disease.

1248
01:29:28,208 --> 01:29:29,903
Is that from them?

1249
01:29:30,611 --> 01:29:34,775
Yeah. But don't be afraid.
I think it's a way to find me, that's all.

1250
01:29:34,948 --> 01:29:38,645
You led them here?
You turned them on your own kind?

1251
01:29:39,453 --> 01:29:43,355
Wait a second, you just said
there's no such thing as aliens.

1252
01:29:45,792 --> 01:29:47,919
Well, there's not.

1253
01:29:48,095 --> 01:29:51,724
But if there were, only a traitorous fool
would bring them here.

1254
01:29:51,898 --> 01:29:52,990
But they have to come.

1255
01:29:53,166 --> 01:29:56,135
They're the ones taking our fish.
They can do something about it.

1256
01:29:56,303 --> 01:29:59,795
None but the Great 'Guin
has the power to give and take away.

1257
01:29:59,973 --> 01:30:04,433
The Great 'Guin didn't put things
out of whack, the aliens did.

1258
01:30:05,012 --> 01:30:08,948
A fool returns this day
to mock our suffering.

1259
01:30:09,116 --> 01:30:13,246
We are starving
and he wants us to hippity-hop.

1260
01:30:13,420 --> 01:30:16,355
So do we hold fast to our ways...

1261
01:30:16,523 --> 01:30:21,222
...or do we bend to the fetid fantasies
of a dancing fool?

1262
01:30:30,037 --> 01:30:32,733
Say, how does that feet thing go again?

1263
01:30:32,906 --> 01:30:34,464
Yeah, show us, Mumble.

1264
01:30:35,842 --> 01:30:37,901
Oh, it's really quite easy.

1265
01:30:38,078 --> 01:30:39,705
No, no!

1266
01:30:39,880 --> 01:30:41,211
No, you must resist!

1267
01:30:42,049 --> 01:30:43,744
That's right.

1268
01:30:44,117 --> 01:30:47,484
- Pointless nonsense.
- Resist! Stand your ground!

1269
01:30:47,654 --> 01:30:50,987
Stand your ground against this folly!

1270
01:30:56,763 --> 01:30:59,823
Raise your voices, brothers.

1271
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:03,299
Cry out in defiance of this jiggity-joggity!

1272
01:31:03,470 --> 01:31:05,597
Show me what you got.

1273
01:31:08,408 --> 01:31:10,137
You got it.

1274
01:31:14,681 --> 01:31:16,114
Come on.

1275
01:31:16,283 --> 01:31:17,614
Work, work it.

1276
01:31:17,784 --> 01:31:20,878
Yes, yes! Call on the wisdoms!

1277
01:31:21,054 --> 01:31:22,783
Let the world tremble!

1278
01:31:23,223 --> 01:31:25,088
For when all others leave...

1279
01:31:25,258 --> 01:31:27,123
...we remain!

1280
01:31:28,862 --> 01:31:30,489
Mumble! Mumble!

1281
01:31:30,664 --> 01:31:33,462
Mama? Amigos.

1282
01:31:34,835 --> 01:31:37,668
- Oh, Mama.
- Oh, my boy.

1283
01:31:37,838 --> 01:31:40,432
- My gorgeous boy.
- Oh, Mama.

1284
01:31:40,607 --> 01:31:42,734
- Look at him.
- You're so dazzling.

1285
01:31:42,909 --> 01:31:45,776
- Oh, Fluffy.
- We waited and waited for you.

1286
01:31:45,946 --> 01:31:48,779
- Oh, yeah.
- Where's Pa?

1287
01:31:48,949 --> 01:31:51,213
Believe me. You don't wanna see
your deadbeat dad.

1288
01:31:51,384 --> 01:31:53,443
- Your pa is sort of...
- What?

1289
01:31:53,620 --> 01:31:55,918
Come on, I'll show you.

1290
01:32:05,298 --> 01:32:07,095
Memphis?

1291
01:32:08,135 --> 01:32:09,568
Memphis?

1292
01:32:09,736 --> 01:32:11,226
Pa?

1293
01:32:15,142 --> 01:32:16,769
Mumble?

1294
01:32:16,943 --> 01:32:18,934
Is it truly you?

1295
01:32:19,112 --> 01:32:21,444
Every last bit of me, Pa.

1296
01:32:25,619 --> 01:32:27,450
I thought...

1297
01:32:31,591 --> 01:32:33,081
Pa?

1298
01:32:36,696 --> 01:32:39,096
There ain't been one day...

1299
01:32:41,067 --> 01:32:45,697
...not one day, that I done right by you.

1300
01:32:50,043 --> 01:32:52,068
Oh, Pa.

1301
01:32:52,245 --> 01:32:54,110
Dance for him, Daddy.

1302
01:32:54,281 --> 01:32:56,272
Dance with your boy.

1303
01:32:59,619 --> 01:33:02,019
You'll have to forgive me.

1304
01:33:02,823 --> 01:33:05,883
The music's gone clean out of me.

1305
01:33:07,761 --> 01:33:09,353
No, it hasn't.

1306
01:33:09,529 --> 01:33:13,329
It's just like singing with your body.

1307
01:33:13,500 --> 01:33:15,525
Come on, baby. We can do it.

1308
01:33:15,702 --> 01:33:17,260
Oh, Mama.

1309
01:33:17,437 --> 01:33:21,806
It's just one big old foot after the other.

1310
01:33:27,214 --> 01:33:28,203
That's it.

1311
01:33:30,217 --> 01:33:32,048
Yeah.

1312
01:33:33,420 --> 01:33:36,253
- Yeah, see?
- Well, that feels good.

1313
01:33:41,494 --> 01:33:44,930
<i>You don't have to be beautiful</i>

1314
01:33:45,365 --> 01:33:46,354
Yeah, Memphis.

1315
01:33:46,600 --> 01:33:48,227
<i>To turn me on</i>

1316
01:33:48,702 --> 01:33:49,691
Daddy.

1317
01:33:49,870 --> 01:33:53,897
<i>I just need your body, baby</i>

1318
01:33:54,074 --> 01:33:56,565
<i>From dusk till dawn</i>

1319
01:33:57,777 --> 01:34:01,508
<i>You don't have to be rich to be my girl</i>

1320
01:34:01,681 --> 01:34:05,674
<i>You don't have to be cool
To rule my world</i>

1321
01:34:05,852 --> 01:34:09,754
<i>Ain't no particular song
I'm more compatible with</i>

1322
01:34:09,923 --> 01:34:14,587
<i>I just want your extra time and your...</i>

1323
01:34:34,915 --> 01:34:37,941
Holy flock!

1324
01:35:03,343 --> 01:35:05,777
Mommy, Mommy, Mommy.

1325
01:35:42,449 --> 01:35:44,815
I think you better dance now.

1326
01:36:38,371 --> 01:36:40,839
First, there was just one.
Now there's thousands.

1327
01:36:41,007 --> 01:36:43,703
- Are they trying to tell us something?
- What's the problem?

1328
01:36:43,877 --> 01:36:46,675
- We're messing with their food chain.
- We've gotta do something.

1329
01:36:46,846 --> 01:36:50,543
- We suggest a ban on all marine harvesting.
- Too much money. Too many jobs.

1330
01:36:52,452 --> 01:36:54,613
Why should we do anything at all?

1331
01:37:00,326 --> 01:37:03,693
They're just a bunch of flightless birds
at the bottom of the world.

1332
01:37:08,201 --> 01:37:10,533
I don't wanna live in a world
without penguins.

1333
01:37:10,703 --> 01:37:12,068
What are we gonna do about it?

1334
01:37:12,238 --> 01:37:13,899
Bang up the sign "No Fishing. "

1335
01:37:15,675 --> 01:37:19,076
Is equal to the love...

1336
01:37:19,245 --> 01:37:20,644
...you make.

1337
01:37:24,717 --> 01:37:28,881
<i>Oh, baby. Right on.</i>

1338
01:37:41,401 --> 01:37:46,532
<i>Looking back on when I
Was a little nappy-headed boy</i>

1339
01:37:49,375 --> 01:37:50,842
<i>It's like a jungle sometimes</i>

1340
01:37:51,010 --> 01:37:53,205
<i>It makes me wonder
How I keep from going under</i>

1341
01:37:55,148 --> 01:37:56,615
Bring it on! Go ahead!

1342
01:37:57,484 --> 01:38:01,477
<i>Even though we sometimes
Would not get a thing</i>

1343
01:38:01,654 --> 01:38:05,522
<i>We were happy with
The joy the day would bring</i>

1344
01:38:05,692 --> 01:38:08,855
<i>I wish those days
Would come back once more</i>

1345
01:38:09,028 --> 01:38:13,226
<i>Come back those days, those days
Come back, don't go</i>

1346
01:38:13,633 --> 01:38:16,295
Come here, babe. Come on back.

1347
01:38:16,469 --> 01:38:17,458
<i>Come on back</i>

1348
01:38:17,637 --> 01:38:19,264
<i>- Come on back
- Come on back</i>

1349
01:38:19,439 --> 01:38:21,930
<i>- Come on back
- Come on back</i>

1350
01:38:22,108 --> 01:38:24,303
<i>I love them, I love them</i>

1351
01:38:24,477 --> 01:38:25,637
<i>I love them, I love them</i>

1352
01:38:30,450 --> 01:38:33,578
<i>Those days, those days
Those days, those days</i>

1353
01:38:33,753 --> 01:38:39,248
<i>Those days</i>

1354
01:48:22,908 --> 01:48:24,899
