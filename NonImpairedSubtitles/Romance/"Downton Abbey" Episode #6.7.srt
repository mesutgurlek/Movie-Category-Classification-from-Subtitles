has invited us all to watch him drive

not drive in it.

more than 10 minutes.

Well, who then?

I'd say this is the work
of Miss Cruikshank.

She's the one always making
a show of friendship.

Why don't I pay a call on her
and see if I can winkle out the truth?

Oh, no. I am yesterday,

You must be feeling very hurt.

Well, yes, the fact is,
I must be very honest,

00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,008
- I am angry at the way I've been treated.
- I don't blame you.

While angry I say things some people
find hard to forgive.

So I have decided to go away.

- Precisely.

But don't fear, I'll call on
Miss Cruikshank before I leave.

Why encourage Mrs Crawley

when your fiancé detests
the mere idea of her?

I still dispute that,

115
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,561
but I would say

116
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:05,167
that Larry had perhaps not quite
thought matters through.

117
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:08,210

- Only that his father is old

and alone

- In need of care?

Which you are not prepared to give.

I would have said a companion.

122
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,043
Which you are not prepared to be.

123
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,447
And what of this house?

She won't want to live at Cavenham

I bet it won't be too lonely

What did he want?

760
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,923
Again, no explanation was proffered.

761
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:17,651
Curiouser and curiouser.

762
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:20,610
Isobel, I hope we haven't kept you
waiting for hours.

763
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:24,321
Not at all. It's entirely my fault,
I got here far too early.

764
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,881
- How was it?
- Terrible, <i>as</i> it happens,

765
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:29,930
- but let's not go into that now.
ISOBEL: I am sorry.

766
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:31,889
And, to be quite honest,

767
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:34,850
- I feel rather awkward.
- Why? What is it?

768
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,446
I’ve a letter from Cousin Violet.

769
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:41,044
- Why didn't she bring it?
- Because she's gone away.

770
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:43,248
Gone away? Where?

771
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:46,768
She is on board to the Paris,
headed for the Mediterranean.

772
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:50,561
This is me, isn’t it? I've done it.
Shes furious with me.

773
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:53,246
I don't see the point
of bringing that up now.

774
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:56,563
- What does it say in the letter?
- Nothing much.

775
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:02,011
She needs a change of air and Spratt
is bringing a present by way of goodbye.

776
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,605
That's why he rang.

777
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:06,969
- Mr Spratt has arrived, my lord.
- Show him in.

778
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:11,967
Well, that is, he's in the servants' hall
with a, uh, present for your lordship

779
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:13,849
and he doesn't want to bring it here.

780
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,800
- What is going on?
- He may be right, my lord.

781
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:19,803
- Let's go and see.
ROBERT: If you wish.

782
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:22,850
But it all seems very rum to me.

783
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:25,642
What is it? What's the surprise?

784
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:28,690
You'll soon see, mi'lord,
but I think it's a good one.

785
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:30,330
- Good day, mi'lord.
- Spratt.

786
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,369
What is this secret
you're to reveal?

787
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:34,807
Her Ladyship chose her herself,
mi'lord.

788
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:36,928
She was most particular.

789
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:44,410
Ah! Hello, little one. Oh!

790
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:47,049
[CHUCKLING]

791
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:49,362
Now, what are we going
to call you?

792
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:52,724
CORA: Oh, hello.
- Oh, I know, Teo.

793
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:55,645
I thought we always had names
from Ancient Egypt.

794
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:59,771
Teo was a wife of Amenhotep the 2nd
and the mother of Tuthmosis the 4th.

795
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:02,685
- Don't you know?
SPRATT: She's not exactly trained yet.

796
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:05,127
We decided against bringing her up.

797
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:08,489
Oh, I don't care about that.
You're coming upstairs with me.

798
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:13,762
- He does love his dogs.
- Mm.

799
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:15,729
How were your guests this morning?

800
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:18,690
- Was everything satisfactory?
- Oh, very.

801
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:21,923
He was a doctor, Mrs Hughes.
Imagine that.

802
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:24,845
So I don't think I could have
started better.

803
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,241
Even if I worked harder
on their breakfast

804
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:29,801
than anything I've done
since Lady Rose got married.

805
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:31,611
Oh, talking of which,

806
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:35,287
has Mr Carson survived his ordeal
from last night?

807
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:36,771
Put it this way,

808
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:40,720
he has discovered a new respect
for the role of cook and bottle-washer,

809
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:43,360
so I think he'll be giving less trouble
in the future.

810
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:44,851
[BOTH LAUGHING]

811
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,570
What's so funny?

812
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:50,530
Just life, Mr Carson.

813
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:52,849
Just life.
