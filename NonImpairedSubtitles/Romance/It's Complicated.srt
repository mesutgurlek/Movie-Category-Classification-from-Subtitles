1
00:01:34,541 --> 00:01:36,133
Hi, Jane.
Hi!

2
00:01:47,287 --> 00:01:50,415
Happy, happy, happy...

3
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:51,548
Anniversary.

4
00:01:53,727 --> 00:01:55,422
Some things
never change, do they?

5
00:01:55,495 --> 00:01:57,224
I just thought
you might be drifting.

6
00:01:57,297 --> 00:01:59,128
He was pausing.
Exactly.

7
00:01:59,232 --> 00:02:01,097
Okay.
Happy anniversary.

8
00:02:01,168 --> 00:02:03,136
You two have led an
extraordinarily blessed life.

9
00:02:03,236 --> 00:02:05,136
Mmm. For as long as I've known you,

10
00:02:05,238 --> 00:02:08,799
you've managed to always somehow
do everything entirely right.

11
00:02:08,909 --> 00:02:10,240
That's so true.

12
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:12,175
BBut honestly, how could it be 30 years?

13
00:02:12,279 --> 00:02:13,507
When did we do
that trip to Spain?

14
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:15,309
It was for both
of our what?

15
00:02:15,415 --> 00:02:16,575
Fifteenth anniversaries.

16
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:18,083
God, that was
a great trip.

17
00:02:18,151 --> 00:02:19,641
Yeah.

18
00:02:19,753 --> 00:02:20,947
Hey, guys. How's it going? Hey!

19
00:02:21,021 --> 00:02:23,512
Hey, Ollie.
How was graduation?

20
00:02:23,623 --> 00:02:25,921
It was fantastic.
When's Luke's graduation?

21
00:02:25,992 --> 00:02:27,152
Next week.

22
00:02:27,227 --> 00:02:28,319
It's in three days.

23
00:02:28,428 --> 00:02:29,952
Oh, I'm sorry.
I mean, this week.

24
00:02:31,198 --> 00:02:34,258
Are the girls going?

25
00:02:35,769 --> 00:02:37,361
Yeah, they can't wait.

26
00:02:37,471 --> 00:02:40,304
How long is Luke home before
he has to go back to work?

27
00:02:42,342 --> 00:02:44,537
Um... Only a week.
Oh!

28
00:02:44,644 --> 00:02:45,633
That's it?

29
00:02:45,712 --> 00:02:46,804
I know. I hate it.

30
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,872
Hi, I'm back.
Hey.

31
00:02:49,649 --> 00:02:50,980
Here you go, babe.

32
00:02:51,051 --> 00:02:55,283
Well, congrats again.
Great, great party.

33
00:02:56,289 --> 00:02:57,381
And I'll see
you two in New York.

34
00:02:57,457 --> 00:02:58,515
Absolutely, I'm looking
forward to it.

35
00:02:58,625 --> 00:03:00,820
Yeah. Good. Well...

36
00:03:00,894 --> 00:03:02,691
Hey, Jane, what are you
wearing to the graduation?

37
00:03:02,796 --> 00:03:05,492
Oh! A suit or a dress.
Probably a suit.

38
00:03:05,565 --> 00:03:07,863
Fancy. Okay. I like that.

39
00:03:07,968 --> 00:03:09,959
Uh, Janey, we'll see you
there. Where are you staying?

40
00:03:10,036 --> 00:03:11,867
We're at the Park Regent.

41
00:03:11,972 --> 00:03:13,667
You said you were at
the Four Seasons, right?

42
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:14,764
I don't know.
Where are we?

43
00:03:14,841 --> 00:03:16,138
We're at
the Park Regent, too.

44
00:03:16,209 --> 00:03:21,237
Oh. Good. That's... That'll
be convenient, actually, for...

45
00:03:22,516 --> 00:03:26,418
Okay. So, well...
See you soon.

46
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,544
BBye, Janey.

47
00:03:27,621 --> 00:03:29,987
I'll walk you out.

48
00:03:31,157 --> 00:03:33,853
I thought it was very sweet how
well you and Jake were getting along.

49
00:03:33,927 --> 00:03:35,895
Yeah.
Felt like old times.

50
00:03:35,996 --> 00:03:39,989
We do know how to do this
by now. It's been 10 years.

51
00:03:40,066 --> 00:03:41,260
Really?
Yeah.

52
00:03:41,368 --> 00:03:43,199
That's crazy.
I know.

53
00:03:48,909 --> 00:03:51,173
BBye-bye.

54
00:04:07,627 --> 00:04:10,596
Gabby, stop. You are never
gonna fit all this in.

55
00:04:10,697 --> 00:04:12,221
You can come back for
the rest of it tomorrow.

56
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:14,733
I can't come back...

57
00:04:14,801 --> 00:04:16,792
Oh, God.
That is all my clothes.

58
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:17,928
This is clothes?

59
00:04:19,873 --> 00:04:23,434
Oh, good, your mom's home.
She'll figure this out.

60
00:04:24,644 --> 00:04:28,808
Gabby, you're leaving now? I thought
you weren't going till the morning.

61
00:04:28,915 --> 00:04:31,110
Yeah, except all
my friends are there

62
00:04:31,184 --> 00:04:32,879
and they want me to
come tonight. So...

63
00:04:32,953 --> 00:04:34,818
BBut it's gonna be
dark soon, honey.

64
00:04:34,921 --> 00:04:36,946
And you can't even
see out the back window.

65
00:04:37,057 --> 00:04:39,252
It's Saturday night, people
will be on the road, drinking...

66
00:04:39,326 --> 00:04:42,489
Mom. Mom, she'll be there in a
couple of hours. She'll be fine.

67
00:04:42,596 --> 00:04:44,325
Okay. I'm just gonna
leave this stuff here

68
00:04:44,397 --> 00:04:45,887
and come back
for it in a few days.

69
00:04:45,966 --> 00:04:47,456
You want me to drive it
down in the morning?

70
00:04:47,567 --> 00:04:48,727
I could be there by lunch.

71
00:04:48,802 --> 00:04:51,965
We could go to that big BBed, BBath
and BBeyond, get kitchen stuff.

72
00:04:52,072 --> 00:04:54,666
Gabby? Gabby, can you
look up from that thing?

73
00:04:54,774 --> 00:04:56,264
I got it covered, Mom.

74
00:04:56,343 --> 00:04:57,970
Hey, gangster. You gonna
help me carry these?

75
00:04:58,078 --> 00:04:59,067
You know it. Yeah.

76
00:04:59,145 --> 00:05:00,476
What up?

77
00:05:00,714 --> 00:05:02,443
Oh, no, don't trouble yourself. Okay.

78
00:05:02,549 --> 00:05:03,573
Why start now?

79
00:05:07,754 --> 00:05:11,315
Mom, are you afraid to
sleep in the house alone?

80
00:05:11,424 --> 00:05:12,652
No.
Are you?

81
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:16,559
No, I'm not! One of you
is always moving out.

82
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:20,122
I'm just wondering who I'm
gonna watch The Hills with.

83
00:05:20,233 --> 00:05:21,723
Oh! Mamacita.

84
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,628
I'm gonna miss you.

85
00:05:25,739 --> 00:05:27,070
Mmm-hmm.

86
00:05:28,074 --> 00:05:29,098
Oh, my God!

87
00:05:29,175 --> 00:05:30,608
L.A.!

88
00:05:31,678 --> 00:05:33,339
Oh, my God!

89
00:05:33,446 --> 00:05:35,141
Stop!

90
00:05:35,749 --> 00:05:36,909
Really doing this.
Okay. Yes, you are.

91
00:05:36,983 --> 00:05:38,177
Do it.

92
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:41,111
Oh, Mom.
What?

93
00:05:41,187 --> 00:05:43,781
You don't happen to know
where Dad is, do you?

94
00:05:43,857 --> 00:05:45,654
'Cause I tried calling him
to say goodbye.

95
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,454
He was at Ted and Sally's.

96
00:05:47,527 --> 00:05:49,654
He was? How was that?

97
00:05:50,096 --> 00:05:51,961
You and the two
of them at the same...

98
00:05:52,032 --> 00:05:53,431
I mean, that must've...

99
00:05:54,668 --> 00:05:55,692
How was that?

100
00:05:55,769 --> 00:05:57,532
It was...

101
00:05:58,204 --> 00:05:59,694
Whatever. It was fine.

102
00:05:59,806 --> 00:06:01,433
Was her lunatic child there?

103
00:06:01,508 --> 00:06:03,772
Not this time, no.

104
00:06:04,144 --> 00:06:05,668
Now, listen to me.

105
00:06:05,745 --> 00:06:07,110
Call me as soon
as you get there.

106
00:06:08,314 --> 00:06:10,646
Do not forget. Gabby!

107
00:06:10,717 --> 00:06:12,548
I will! I'll call you.

108
00:06:12,619 --> 00:06:13,984
You knock 'em dead,
little one.

109
00:06:14,054 --> 00:06:15,851
Hey, and call us
when you get there, too.

110
00:06:15,955 --> 00:06:18,116
None of this
on the road. Dangerous.

111
00:06:18,191 --> 00:06:19,624
Right. Thank you.

112
00:06:19,693 --> 00:06:20,887
Okay. BBye!

113
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,222
BBye.

114
00:06:22,328 --> 00:06:23,795
I love you, guys.
BBye.

115
00:06:30,303 --> 00:06:33,466
They grow up so freaking
fast, don't they?

116
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:35,371
I just hate it.
I hate it.

117
00:06:37,143 --> 00:06:39,668
Mom, maybe you
should get a dog.

118
00:06:39,746 --> 00:06:41,805
Oh, my God.
Goodbye, you two.

119
00:06:42,816 --> 00:06:44,113
BBye. Love you, boss.

120
00:06:44,184 --> 00:06:45,583
Love you.

121
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:53,150
BBye, Mom!

122
00:07:44,544 --> 00:07:45,568
Here you go.

123
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:58,314
Reynaldo.

124
00:07:58,391 --> 00:08:00,882
Yeah? Too much sugar.
Little bit.

125
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,587
I know.
Have you been helped?

126
00:08:02,662 --> 00:08:05,927
Hey, who wants coffee
while you're waiting?

127
00:08:06,332 --> 00:08:07,924
Everything okay?
It's great, thanks.

128
00:08:08,001 --> 00:08:10,299
Good.

129
00:08:10,737 --> 00:08:11,726
Go check on table five,
would you?

130
00:08:11,805 --> 00:08:12,829
Sure.

131
00:08:12,939 --> 00:08:14,236
Thanks.

132
00:08:15,108 --> 00:08:16,666
Hello.
Hi.

133
00:08:16,776 --> 00:08:18,266
Jane!

134
00:08:18,344 --> 00:08:19,368
Peter. Hi!

135
00:08:19,445 --> 00:08:20,434
Hi.

136
00:08:20,513 --> 00:08:21,707
How are you?

137
00:08:21,781 --> 00:08:22,941
Hi!

138
00:08:23,016 --> 00:08:24,916
I can't remember, have you
ever met Adam Schaeffer?

139
00:08:24,984 --> 00:08:26,315
Yes.
No.

140
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,081
Well, it was...
It was quick. Well...

141
00:08:30,857 --> 00:08:32,324
Look what we've got.

142
00:08:32,392 --> 00:08:33,450
Your plans.

143
00:08:33,526 --> 00:08:35,323
I'm so excited!

144
00:08:39,132 --> 00:08:41,930
I've been thinking
about this addition for...

145
00:08:42,001 --> 00:08:42,990
Ten years.

146
00:08:43,069 --> 00:08:44,536
Ten years? I know.

147
00:08:46,539 --> 00:08:49,531
Mmm-hmm.

148
00:08:51,044 --> 00:08:54,639
Ooh! This is nice. I like
this wall of windows, Peter.

149
00:08:54,714 --> 00:08:56,841
That was Adam, actually.

150
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:58,508
Oh!

151
00:08:58,618 --> 00:09:02,213
And I love where you've put
the stairs. That is so good.

152
00:09:02,322 --> 00:09:04,381
Adam's idea.

153
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:08,856
I'm finally getting
a reaI kitchen

154
00:09:08,962 --> 00:09:12,523
with four walls and place
to put everything I want.

155
00:09:14,634 --> 00:09:17,899
You actually understood
what I wanted.

156
00:09:18,004 --> 00:09:19,528
AII Adam.

157
00:09:20,807 --> 00:09:22,069
I'm happy you like it.

158
00:09:22,141 --> 00:09:24,405
I'm so... Hi.

159
00:09:24,644 --> 00:09:25,906
Hello.

160
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:29,639
So, you read all my e-mails.

161
00:09:29,716 --> 00:09:32,241
AII 47 of them, yes.

162
00:09:32,585 --> 00:09:34,712
Jane, it's 10:15.
Yeah?

163
00:09:34,821 --> 00:09:36,311
Oh, it is.

164
00:09:36,389 --> 00:09:39,358
Sorry, I have an appointment,
a dentist appointment.

165
00:09:40,059 --> 00:09:41,151
Sure.

166
00:09:41,227 --> 00:09:42,216
And, could you
just leave those here

167
00:09:42,295 --> 00:09:44,320
so I could make
a few notes and...

168
00:09:44,397 --> 00:09:48,060
Oh, actually, I do have
one tiny note now.

169
00:09:48,201 --> 00:09:51,261
In my bathroom,
no "his-and-her" sinks.

170
00:09:52,272 --> 00:09:54,502
Oh, okay. Sure. No "his. "

171
00:09:54,574 --> 00:09:55,734
Just "hers. "

172
00:09:55,842 --> 00:09:58,606
And you don't think in the
future you might want a "his"?

173
00:09:58,711 --> 00:10:01,236
Oh, God, we're talking
code about my life now.

174
00:10:01,347 --> 00:10:02,439
No, no,
I didn't mean to be.

175
00:10:02,548 --> 00:10:06,075
The truth is, in my current
bathroom I have two sinks

176
00:10:06,185 --> 00:10:10,417
and sometimes, the other
sink makes me feeI bad.

177
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:14,620
One sink. Not a problem.

178
00:10:14,727 --> 00:10:18,026
BBut we should schedule another
meeting. Is Tuesday good for you?

179
00:10:18,097 --> 00:10:20,361
Tuesday's great.
8:30 too early?

180
00:10:20,433 --> 00:10:22,298
At the house?
I'll be there.

181
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:32,241
Hi.
Hi.

182
00:10:32,312 --> 00:10:34,007
Hello, I'm Dr. Moss.

183
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,741
Hi, I'm Jane Adler.

184
00:10:35,815 --> 00:10:37,806
So, what brings
you in today?

185
00:10:37,917 --> 00:10:41,580
Well... Please don't
take this the wrong way.

186
00:10:41,821 --> 00:10:43,049
BBut I'm the type of person

187
00:10:43,122 --> 00:10:46,922
who kind of makes fun of
people who get plastic surgery.

188
00:10:46,993 --> 00:10:48,620
Well, I understand that.

189
00:10:48,728 --> 00:10:50,286
You do? Good.
Mmm-hmm.

190
00:10:50,396 --> 00:10:56,460
BBecause, you know, some women can
look a little fake and plasticky.

191
00:10:56,569 --> 00:10:59,094
And, I don't know, just,
in my opinion, worse.

192
00:10:59,172 --> 00:11:00,196
I agree.

193
00:11:00,273 --> 00:11:02,104
Well, good.
BBecause... Okay.

194
00:11:02,175 --> 00:11:05,906
So, as against the whole
thing as I... As I am,

195
00:11:07,914 --> 00:11:10,405
I do have a problem
that's really bugging me.

196
00:11:10,483 --> 00:11:13,577
My left eyelid
is really saggy

197
00:11:13,653 --> 00:11:16,349
and sometimes I find
myself holding it up

198
00:11:16,422 --> 00:11:18,287
when I'm watching TV
or reading or...

199
00:11:19,592 --> 00:11:22,686
I was just wondering if
that's something you could fix.

200
00:11:22,795 --> 00:11:25,286
Look straight ahead. Okay.

201
00:11:25,765 --> 00:11:28,427
Well, you have the same amount
of excess skin on both sides.

202
00:11:28,501 --> 00:11:30,526
Really? Oh.

203
00:11:30,636 --> 00:11:34,197
Well, I'm only interested
in fixing one eye.

204
00:11:34,507 --> 00:11:37,135
Jane, what you need to
fix this is a brow-lift.

205
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:40,202
A brow-lift?
What is that exactly?

206
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,641
Well, we surgically
cut at the hairline.

207
00:11:42,715 --> 00:11:44,512
We make
an incision right here

208
00:11:44,617 --> 00:11:45,777
and then we
pull the skin back

209
00:11:45,852 --> 00:11:47,217
a little tighter
over your skull

210
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,379
and staple it in place
right over your ears.

211
00:11:49,489 --> 00:11:51,320
Now, recovery is
not all that bad.

212
00:11:51,391 --> 00:11:54,360
You could be quite numb, and
you'll probably have a headache

213
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:57,486
that lasts anywhere from,
say, three to six months.

214
00:11:57,563 --> 00:11:59,463
Three to six months!
Oh. Awesome.

215
00:12:14,047 --> 00:12:16,208
Yes, it did. I am
under a lot of pressure.

216
00:12:16,315 --> 00:12:17,646
I don't know if
you're aware of that.

217
00:12:17,717 --> 00:12:18,979
No, no. I think
that is something

218
00:12:19,052 --> 00:12:20,644
that you should
fully be aware of.

219
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,655
Okay. Okay. BBut that's
not what you said.

220
00:12:23,723 --> 00:12:24,849
Jane!

221
00:12:24,957 --> 00:12:26,618
Hey.
Oh! Hi.

222
00:12:26,692 --> 00:12:28,250
Hello.
Hi.

223
00:12:29,128 --> 00:12:30,459
Jake. Jake.

224
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:34,523
Jake. Jake. Jake. Jake.
Jake. Jake? Hello, Jake?

225
00:12:34,634 --> 00:12:36,534
Uh, hold on, Pedro.
I'm talking with somebody.

226
00:12:36,636 --> 00:12:39,298
Pedro, up! Now!

227
00:12:40,907 --> 00:12:42,465
So, what are you
doing in this building?

228
00:12:42,542 --> 00:12:43,941
Dentist.

229
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:45,238
You don't go to
Sharon anymore?

230
00:12:45,344 --> 00:12:47,244
No. Changed.

231
00:12:48,147 --> 00:12:49,512
Oh.

232
00:13:07,266 --> 00:13:08,324
Yeah...

233
00:13:08,401 --> 00:13:09,993
Okay, buddy. Here we go. Jake.

234
00:13:10,069 --> 00:13:12,697
Okay, Pedro, honey,
don't do that. Pedro.

235
00:13:13,406 --> 00:13:14,873
See you in the BBig Apple.
I'll see you there.

236
00:13:20,446 --> 00:13:22,676
That is beyond!

237
00:13:22,782 --> 00:13:26,013
When the three of them
got in the elevator...

238
00:13:26,119 --> 00:13:28,917
BBetween that
and the staples

239
00:13:28,988 --> 00:13:31,513
and the headache
for six months...

240
00:13:31,624 --> 00:13:33,353
That was the most
insane hour of my life.

241
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,784
Jake has lost his mind.

242
00:13:35,862 --> 00:13:37,124
Yeah, I don't know.

243
00:13:37,196 --> 00:13:40,029
Oh, I know. He's a complete
prick for cheating on you.

244
00:13:40,133 --> 00:13:42,192
I can't disagree
with you on that.

245
00:13:42,368 --> 00:13:45,428
And then he marries her.
A known lunatic.

246
00:13:45,505 --> 00:13:46,870
Well, she has a big job.

247
00:13:48,341 --> 00:13:49,535
Why do you always say that?

248
00:13:49,642 --> 00:13:52,805
BBecause she does. She runs the
whole marketing department at KY

249
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:55,848
or whatever that
station's called.

250
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:59,841
She can't be that
big of a lunatic.

251
00:13:59,952 --> 00:14:01,044
Janey, come on.

252
00:14:01,154 --> 00:14:03,952
He cheats on you with her,
your 20 year marriage ends.

253
00:14:04,023 --> 00:14:06,014
Then six months later,
she leaves Jake

254
00:14:06,092 --> 00:14:07,650
and runs off with
some random guy,

255
00:14:07,727 --> 00:14:10,491
has a baby, then leaves
that guy for Jake.

256
00:14:10,563 --> 00:14:11,791
And she's not nuts?

257
00:14:11,864 --> 00:14:14,833
Oh, Jo, you are so
lucky Jerry is dead.

258
00:14:14,901 --> 00:14:16,391
Thank you.

259
00:14:16,502 --> 00:14:18,868
No, I mean, you don't
have to bump into him.

260
00:14:18,971 --> 00:14:20,302
Well, that's true.
Yeah.

261
00:14:21,974 --> 00:14:24,135
Oh, Janey,
do you wanna meet a guy

262
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:26,337
I met on Match. com
that I didn't like?

263
00:14:26,412 --> 00:14:28,642
Oh, wow,
what a great offer.

264
00:14:28,714 --> 00:14:30,477
No, thanks.
I don't think so.

265
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:32,575
Well, he wasn't that awfuI.

266
00:14:32,685 --> 00:14:34,710
Sounding better
every minute.

267
00:14:35,354 --> 00:14:39,814
You know, it's not healthy to not
have sex for however long it's been.

268
00:14:41,027 --> 00:14:44,554
Trust me, I am not
not doing it on purpose.

269
00:14:44,664 --> 00:14:46,427
Oh.

270
00:14:46,532 --> 00:14:48,261
Okay, I don't know
if this is true...

271
00:14:48,334 --> 00:14:49,392
Mmm-hmm.

272
00:14:49,502 --> 00:14:50,696
...but I read online
about a woman

273
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:52,601
that hadn't
done it in so long

274
00:14:52,705 --> 00:14:55,503
that her vagina closed up.

275
00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:01,546
What?
Get out of here! Come on.

276
00:15:01,614 --> 00:15:04,208
I swear to God,
it grew back together.

277
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:09,215
Wait, was it
ever one piece?

278
00:15:09,355 --> 00:15:11,016
What? Ooh, no.

279
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:12,853
No, she had to have
a vaginoplasty.

280
00:15:12,925 --> 00:15:13,949
Ouch!

281
00:15:14,026 --> 00:15:15,288
Oh, God!

282
00:15:17,029 --> 00:15:21,227
"Hello, Dr. Moss, I have a little
situation that needs fixing. "

283
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:24,235
BBubbee. BBubbee, if you wanna
have your situation fixed,

284
00:15:24,303 --> 00:15:26,237
you have to date someone.

285
00:15:26,305 --> 00:15:27,636
Seriously.

286
00:15:29,909 --> 00:15:31,103
Anyone.

287
00:15:52,064 --> 00:15:53,497
Oh, there he is!

288
00:15:54,734 --> 00:15:57,794
There he is!

289
00:15:57,903 --> 00:15:59,393
Oh, hello.

290
00:16:00,773 --> 00:16:02,673
Good to see you! We missed you. Hi!

291
00:16:02,908 --> 00:16:05,433
Who is this guy? Hey, hey. How are you?

292
00:16:05,511 --> 00:16:08,708
Oh, I love it when we're
all in the same time zone!

293
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:12,577
So, what's up, Luke? Did you
decide to have that party?

294
00:16:12,652 --> 00:16:13,846
Oh, yeah, big time.

295
00:16:13,953 --> 00:16:15,181
What party?

296
00:16:15,288 --> 00:16:16,448
Are you guys
going to sleep over?

297
00:16:16,522 --> 00:16:18,080
Yeah, if you give us your
bed and change the sheets.

298
00:16:18,157 --> 00:16:19,317
You're having
a party? When?

299
00:16:19,425 --> 00:16:21,154
Hi. Adler, two rooms.

300
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:22,420
Hopefully next
to each other.

301
00:16:22,495 --> 00:16:26,329
I have an Adler, J. in a
Superior Suite. Park Avenue view?

302
00:16:26,532 --> 00:16:30,161
Oh, I'm sorry, here it is.
Adler, J., two standard doubles.

303
00:16:30,269 --> 00:16:31,531
Sorry about that.
Right.

304
00:16:31,637 --> 00:16:34,765
We are not the ones
in the Superior Suite.

305
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:35,898
Mmm.

306
00:16:35,975 --> 00:16:39,467
Have the other Adlers checked
in yet? Just wondering.

307
00:16:39,545 --> 00:16:41,308
No, they haven't, ma'am.
Not yet.

308
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:43,974
Now, I just need a credit
card and your signature.

309
00:16:44,617 --> 00:16:46,642
Can the girls come with
me now and help me set up?

310
00:16:46,719 --> 00:16:48,983
Oh, and by girls,
he means the three of us.

311
00:16:49,055 --> 00:16:51,148
Wait, hold on.
Set up for what?

312
00:16:51,223 --> 00:16:54,522
I have reservations for us for
dinner. That's not happening now?

313
00:16:54,627 --> 00:16:56,117
I don't know.

314
00:16:56,195 --> 00:16:58,527
Me and my friends are having
this huge thing at our apartment

315
00:16:58,631 --> 00:17:00,861
and the girls said
they'd help us set up.

316
00:17:02,468 --> 00:17:04,561
We're gonna be together
all day tomorrow.

317
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:07,332
Mom, it's his last night
before graduation.

318
00:17:07,406 --> 00:17:08,805
Okay, okay.

319
00:17:09,408 --> 00:17:12,844
Can I do anything
to help, or you know...

320
00:17:14,647 --> 00:17:16,911
Love your credit card.

321
00:17:17,016 --> 00:17:18,381
Oh.

322
00:17:20,086 --> 00:17:22,316
Here it goes.
Once again.

323
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:55,019
Hi!
Hi.

324
00:17:55,087 --> 00:17:58,352
Adler, for one, Room 2112.

325
00:17:58,424 --> 00:18:00,221
Your table is almost ready, Mrs. Adler.

326
00:18:00,292 --> 00:18:02,192
Would you like to wait in the bar? Sure.

327
00:18:08,267 --> 00:18:10,393
Hi.

328
00:18:12,104 --> 00:18:13,503
I'll have a Pinot Noir.

329
00:18:13,572 --> 00:18:15,039
Right away.

330
00:18:15,107 --> 00:18:17,735
No, you know, I'll have a
very dry Tanqueray Martini,

331
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:18,868
straight up with a twist.

332
00:18:18,944 --> 00:18:20,104
Mmm-hmm.

333
00:18:32,091 --> 00:18:33,422
Hey.

334
00:18:37,663 --> 00:18:38,823
Where's your...

335
00:18:38,898 --> 00:18:40,889
Uh, Pedro got
the stomach flu.

336
00:18:40,966 --> 00:18:42,456
So, I'm flying solo.

337
00:18:42,568 --> 00:18:46,504
Really? Didn't know you
knew how to be by yourself.

338
00:18:46,605 --> 00:18:49,267
Any chance you
could go easy on me?

339
00:18:49,475 --> 00:18:51,170
Just a one-night free pass.

340
00:18:52,678 --> 00:18:54,009
You look good, Janey.

341
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:55,307
Yeah.

342
00:18:55,848 --> 00:18:57,748
You do. You always do.

343
00:18:57,817 --> 00:18:59,614
Your hair's shorter.
Longer.

344
00:18:59,685 --> 00:19:00,913
I like it.

345
00:19:01,787 --> 00:19:03,379
Mrs. Adler?
Your table is ready.

346
00:19:03,456 --> 00:19:04,514
Yes? Thank you.

347
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:07,787
Do you want
some company, Mrs. Adler?

348
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,851
Could we eat at the bar?
Absolutely.

349
00:19:09,962 --> 00:19:11,827
All right.
We both have to eat.

350
00:19:11,897 --> 00:19:13,364
Mmm.

351
00:19:13,466 --> 00:19:16,333
When was the last time
we had a meaI together?

352
00:19:16,435 --> 00:19:18,835
You and me? Alone? 1999.

353
00:19:18,938 --> 00:19:22,271
So, come on.
Once every 10 years.

354
00:19:30,616 --> 00:19:33,551
So, how are things in
the fertility world?

355
00:19:33,652 --> 00:19:35,813
I can't believe it took you
this long to bring that up.

356
00:19:35,888 --> 00:19:37,014
Sperm issues?

357
00:19:37,122 --> 00:19:38,612
Apparently, yes.

358
00:19:38,691 --> 00:19:40,716
A baby?

359
00:19:40,826 --> 00:19:42,691
Really, Jake?

360
00:19:43,729 --> 00:19:47,825
So, the next time you go to a
graduation, you'll be, what, 58 plus...

361
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:51,131
I believe the number
you're looking for is 79.

362
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:53,800
Okay. Yeah.

363
00:19:53,873 --> 00:19:56,205
Seriously,
how is that good?

364
00:19:56,742 --> 00:19:58,505
Why are we
talking about this?

365
00:19:58,577 --> 00:20:00,511
I thought we were
going to have some fun.

366
00:20:00,579 --> 00:20:02,137
Where did you
get that idea?

367
00:20:03,549 --> 00:20:06,245
Why do you want to know
this? You're obsessed.

368
00:20:06,352 --> 00:20:08,820
Just tell me, how long
were you seeing him for?

369
00:20:08,888 --> 00:20:11,356
Oh, please,
it was five years ago.

370
00:20:11,423 --> 00:20:13,323
I know, but I always
wondered. So? Mmm-hmm.

371
00:20:14,393 --> 00:20:15,690
Little jealous?

372
00:20:15,761 --> 00:20:17,251
Yes.

373
00:20:17,429 --> 00:20:19,158
Oh, the man is married now.

374
00:20:19,231 --> 00:20:21,756
I don't care. How long?

375
00:20:22,268 --> 00:20:24,566
Eight months.

376
00:20:24,637 --> 00:20:25,695
Long.

377
00:20:25,771 --> 00:20:27,602
Not long.

378
00:20:29,842 --> 00:20:30,866
No!

379
00:20:46,592 --> 00:20:49,925
This song reminds me of your birthday
party. The one in our old house.

380
00:20:50,029 --> 00:20:53,931
Oh! Oh, that was
such a fun night.

381
00:20:54,033 --> 00:20:56,297
So fun. You wore
that halter dress.

382
00:20:56,402 --> 00:20:57,926
Yeah.

383
00:20:59,972 --> 00:21:00,996
Oh, man.

384
00:21:01,073 --> 00:21:02,370
You wanna dance?

385
00:21:03,909 --> 00:21:05,206
No.

386
00:21:31,937 --> 00:21:34,770
You're married
to someone else!

387
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,808
Tell me about it.

388
00:21:57,930 --> 00:21:59,192
Home sweet home.

389
00:21:59,264 --> 00:22:01,425
Oh! Oh, God!

390
00:22:03,435 --> 00:22:05,630
That was one crazy ride.

391
00:22:05,704 --> 00:22:08,138
I thought we were
going to break the bed.

392
00:22:09,441 --> 00:22:11,807
I'm having
an out-of-body experience.

393
00:22:11,877 --> 00:22:13,276
Totally.

394
00:22:13,345 --> 00:22:16,781
You're so great, Janey. I
forgot how great. Holy shit.

395
00:22:16,849 --> 00:22:20,341
Please just shut up.

396
00:22:20,452 --> 00:22:22,682
I'm so dizzy.

397
00:22:22,788 --> 00:22:24,881
And the Pilates are
paying off, by the way.

398
00:22:27,826 --> 00:22:29,885
Oh, no! Are you okay?

399
00:22:29,995 --> 00:22:31,223
Look the other way, Jake.

400
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:32,319
Why?

401
00:22:32,398 --> 00:22:33,456
BBecause I have to get up.

402
00:22:33,532 --> 00:22:34,590
Well, Jane,
I've seen your...

403
00:22:34,667 --> 00:22:36,066
Look the other way, Jake!

404
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:45,899
Are you okay?

405
00:22:45,978 --> 00:22:47,036
What is wrong with us?

406
00:22:47,146 --> 00:22:51,810
What do you mean? This was
amazing. We just had a great time.

407
00:22:51,884 --> 00:22:54,011
Oh,
a great time.

408
00:22:54,086 --> 00:22:57,886
This is the dumbest thing
two people have ever done!

409
00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:01,551
Oh, really? I don't know.
I haven't thought it through,

410
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:05,357
but off the top of my head
I thought it was smoking hot,

411
00:23:05,431 --> 00:23:08,423
so something about
it wasn't so dumb.

412
00:23:08,534 --> 00:23:12,436
And FYI, I like that you
stopped getting bikini waxes.

413
00:23:12,538 --> 00:23:14,369
You've gone native.

414
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,737
I was into it.

415
00:23:28,387 --> 00:23:29,786
I love you.

416
00:23:36,695 --> 00:23:38,128
Do you see him?
No.

417
00:23:40,499 --> 00:23:42,194
There he is!

418
00:23:46,371 --> 00:23:47,770
Hey!

419
00:23:49,641 --> 00:23:50,869
Oh!

420
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,251
Look at Dad.

421
00:24:10,796 --> 00:24:12,491
Lukey!

422
00:24:21,607 --> 00:24:23,734
AII I hear is, "Luke David
Adler. " I got to go up.

423
00:24:23,809 --> 00:24:25,242
I got to jump
over these people.

424
00:24:26,278 --> 00:24:27,870
From our seats
it looked like you were

425
00:24:27,946 --> 00:24:29,811
crowd-surfing at
a Metallica show.

426
00:24:29,915 --> 00:24:30,939
Come on.

427
00:24:32,918 --> 00:24:33,976
You okay?

428
00:24:34,052 --> 00:24:35,451
Yeah. Totally.

429
00:24:42,861 --> 00:24:47,321
I would like to propose
a toast to your mother.

430
00:24:47,432 --> 00:24:49,764
To me? What?

431
00:24:49,835 --> 00:24:53,703
Now, I've done my part with
you guys, but, Jane, you...

432
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:56,134
Very talented you.

433
00:24:56,208 --> 00:24:57,368
Oh, God!

434
00:24:57,476 --> 00:24:58,773
Gabby, I'm serious.

435
00:24:58,844 --> 00:25:01,779
Jane, you've done
a magnificent job,

436
00:25:02,314 --> 00:25:03,838
as you always do.

437
00:25:03,949 --> 00:25:08,352
When I look at you three
beautifuI kids all grown up,

438
00:25:08,453 --> 00:25:11,183
I think of all the work
your mother did...

439
00:25:12,858 --> 00:25:14,348
Much of it without my help.

440
00:25:14,459 --> 00:25:16,427
Dude, pull it together.

441
00:25:16,495 --> 00:25:17,587
Yeah.

442
00:25:18,664 --> 00:25:21,360
Janey, I take
my hat off to you.

443
00:25:21,466 --> 00:25:23,991
Okay, Jake. Thank you.

444
00:25:24,102 --> 00:25:27,833
Out of nowhere, sudden appreciation.
BBut, thank you, really.

445
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:31,376
Not totally out of nowhere,
Jane. If you know what I mean.

446
00:25:32,144 --> 00:25:34,942
Which I don't.
BBut...

447
00:25:35,013 --> 00:25:36,071
What's he...

448
00:25:36,148 --> 00:25:37,672
I have no idea.
It's just...

449
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:39,711
Can we just move on?

450
00:25:39,818 --> 00:25:43,015
Okay, I would like to say
something, too. For reaI.

451
00:25:44,022 --> 00:25:46,889
No offense to the lovely Agness
or her charming offspring...

452
00:25:48,527 --> 00:25:50,685
Not nice.

453
00:25:51,196 --> 00:25:52,527
I know, I'm sorry.

454
00:25:52,631 --> 00:25:56,567
BBut I just wanted to say,
I really loved today.

455
00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:00,800
Just being with
the originaI five.

456
00:26:00,873 --> 00:26:03,398
Plus Harley,
but he's like one of us.

457
00:26:03,642 --> 00:26:06,611
I don't think we've
ever done this before...

458
00:26:06,745 --> 00:26:09,578
Had a meaI together
and hung out like this.

459
00:26:09,681 --> 00:26:11,740
You mean other than the
first 13 years of your life.

460
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:13,317
Oh, I know
what she's saying.

461
00:26:13,385 --> 00:26:19,722
It's been awesome just for
a whole day to be just us.

462
00:26:37,576 --> 00:26:41,239
Something feels right in the
universe again, doesn't it?

463
00:26:44,116 --> 00:26:47,210
So, who's coming home, when?
No one's told me the details.

464
00:26:49,521 --> 00:26:51,785
Hey. So how's Pedro feeling?

465
00:26:53,125 --> 00:26:54,183
Okay, we're gonna
pack Luke up.

466
00:26:54,259 --> 00:26:55,624
Three of us leave
day after tomorrow

467
00:26:55,727 --> 00:26:57,456
and Luke's coming home
end of the week.

468
00:26:57,562 --> 00:26:59,723
Uh, I will.
Great.

469
00:26:59,798 --> 00:27:02,767
I'll call you
when I land. BBye.

470
00:27:02,868 --> 00:27:04,893
Hey, Janey,
what flight are you on?

471
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:06,733
I'm on the 4:00.

472
00:27:06,805 --> 00:27:08,534
Oh! Too bad,
I'm on the 5:00.

473
00:27:08,607 --> 00:27:11,132
That's nuts! Why don't you
try to get on the same flight?

474
00:27:11,243 --> 00:27:13,234
Yeah, I could try.

475
00:27:13,545 --> 00:27:15,536
It's been great,
but let's not push it.

476
00:27:15,614 --> 00:27:17,047
Mom, he's just
trying to be nice.

477
00:27:17,115 --> 00:27:20,551
I know. I know. I know.
Okay, I gotta take off, kids.

478
00:27:20,619 --> 00:27:21,677
So, thank you for staying.

479
00:27:21,753 --> 00:27:22,742
Absolutely, yeah.

480
00:27:22,821 --> 00:27:25,619
You be good.
I'm so proud of you.

481
00:27:25,724 --> 00:27:26,884
Thanks, Mom.

482
00:27:26,959 --> 00:27:28,426
You can
call me if you need me.

483
00:27:28,493 --> 00:27:30,961
Mmm-hmm.

484
00:27:34,333 --> 00:27:36,528
It was really fun.

485
00:27:37,736 --> 00:27:39,670
Just follow a few basic rules

486
00:27:39,738 --> 00:27:41,763
to make your divorce
a less hurtfuI one,

487
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,331
by breaking
the cycle of conflict.

488
00:27:44,443 --> 00:27:46,843
Accept your ex
for who she is.

489
00:27:47,346 --> 00:27:49,007
A very big ho!

490
00:27:49,114 --> 00:27:50,445
And try to remember

491
00:27:50,515 --> 00:27:51,812
when you first
fell in love...

492
00:27:51,917 --> 00:27:54,511
There she is.
And there she goes.

493
00:27:56,922 --> 00:27:58,253
Jane!

494
00:28:00,359 --> 00:28:01,417
It's Adam.

495
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,888
Oh! It's 8:30,
Tuesday morning!

496
00:28:04,963 --> 00:28:05,987
Are we still okay?

497
00:28:06,064 --> 00:28:08,123
Yes! Yes!
I totally forgot.

498
00:28:08,233 --> 00:28:11,225
Really sorry. Can you give me
a lift back up to the house?

499
00:28:11,303 --> 00:28:13,134
Sure. Come on in.

500
00:28:13,205 --> 00:28:14,263
Thanks.

501
00:28:15,073 --> 00:28:17,007
But perhaps the most
important lesson

502
00:28:17,109 --> 00:28:20,078
in going through your divorce
is to learn to forgive.

503
00:28:20,145 --> 00:28:21,578
Forgiveness is the key to...

504
00:28:21,646 --> 00:28:22,977
Oh! Oh! Sorry.

505
00:28:23,048 --> 00:28:24,743
Forgiveness is...

506
00:28:28,587 --> 00:28:31,488
In spite of your hurt feelings,
prove to her that you are...

507
00:28:33,091 --> 00:28:35,116
Well...

508
00:28:37,162 --> 00:28:38,993
Just getting a divorce?

509
00:28:39,097 --> 00:28:41,327
Yeah.
Two-and-a-half years ago.

510
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,458
Whoa!

511
00:28:42,534 --> 00:28:45,526
It's, uh,
been a process.

512
00:28:46,972 --> 00:28:48,496
Here's the good news.

513
00:28:48,607 --> 00:28:52,543
In two more years, you'll actually
begin to feeI normaI again.

514
00:28:52,644 --> 00:28:55,977
In two more years
I'll begin to feeI normaI?

515
00:28:56,048 --> 00:28:59,484
Why am I having trouble
seeing that as good news?

516
00:29:00,152 --> 00:29:02,620
Maybe that was
just my experience.

517
00:29:02,687 --> 00:29:04,712
Oh, God, I hope so.

518
00:29:12,898 --> 00:29:15,867
Oh, I have an idea.
Let's see if this works.

519
00:29:15,967 --> 00:29:17,559
So, if we move
this wall back a bit,

520
00:29:17,636 --> 00:29:19,160
uh, we can bring
this arch forward,

521
00:29:19,237 --> 00:29:20,397
which is really where
you want it, right?

522
00:29:20,505 --> 00:29:22,370
Yeah, I would love that. I thought so.

523
00:29:24,076 --> 00:29:27,568
I have an idea. What if
we move my bedroom wall

524
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:32,582
like 6 or 8 feet that way, just so
I can get more of the morning light?

525
00:29:33,251 --> 00:29:34,513
Not possible?

526
00:29:34,586 --> 00:29:36,850
Yes. BBut you'd wake up in the morning,

527
00:29:36,922 --> 00:29:39,584
walk out your bedroom door and
fall 12 feet into the kitchen.

528
00:29:39,691 --> 00:29:42,990
I forgot it
was all open up there.

529
00:29:43,061 --> 00:29:44,050
BBut I see where
you're headed,

530
00:29:44,129 --> 00:29:45,187
so let me see
what I can do.

531
00:29:45,263 --> 00:29:47,629
BBy the way, this property is so great.

532
00:29:47,699 --> 00:29:48,859
Have you lived here
a long time?

533
00:29:48,934 --> 00:29:50,993
About 10 years. I tried...

534
00:29:52,537 --> 00:29:56,871
Oh! I bought the place right
after my divorce and, um...

535
00:29:56,942 --> 00:29:59,433
It's taken me

536
00:29:59,511 --> 00:30:02,571
untiI now to be able
to finally do this.

537
00:30:02,681 --> 00:30:04,842
Good morning.

538
00:30:04,916 --> 00:30:06,008
Uh... Hi.

539
00:30:06,084 --> 00:30:07,312
Am I interrupting?

540
00:30:07,385 --> 00:30:09,376
Adam, this is
my ex-husband...

541
00:30:09,454 --> 00:30:10,887
Oh!
... Jake.

542
00:30:10,956 --> 00:30:12,753
Adam Schaeffer,
my architect.

543
00:30:12,858 --> 00:30:14,086
Hi.
Good to meet you.

544
00:30:14,192 --> 00:30:15,557
Uh, can I take a look?
Do you mind?

545
00:30:15,627 --> 00:30:19,290
Well, everything's not
100% worked out yet.

546
00:30:19,397 --> 00:30:23,231
Wow! You're finally getting
that kitchen you always wanted.

547
00:30:23,301 --> 00:30:24,928
Yeah.

548
00:30:25,036 --> 00:30:27,129
Hmm. Huge bedroom.

549
00:30:28,073 --> 00:30:30,473
No,
it's not huge. It's...

550
00:30:31,476 --> 00:30:36,038
Why don't I show these to you a
little later when we're closer to...

551
00:30:36,114 --> 00:30:39,140
Uh... I... I think our next
step is to stake out the addition

552
00:30:39,251 --> 00:30:40,513
and see how it
feels size-wise.

553
00:30:40,585 --> 00:30:41,813
Yeah, that would be great.

554
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,115
So, I will e-maiI you
and we'll set something up.

555
00:30:44,222 --> 00:30:45,484
Sounds great.

556
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:47,285
Jake, nice meeting you.

557
00:30:47,359 --> 00:30:48,986
Yeah, you, too.

558
00:30:50,562 --> 00:30:52,291
Got time for
a cup of coffee?

559
00:30:52,364 --> 00:30:53,558
Sure.

560
00:31:00,839 --> 00:31:03,399
Why haven't you returned
any of my calls or e-mails?

561
00:31:03,475 --> 00:31:08,071
Jake, come on!
This is just too weird.

562
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:14,145
We have to just never do
what we did ever again.

563
00:31:15,353 --> 00:31:17,685
You are
an adulterer and I am

564
00:31:17,789 --> 00:31:19,689
an awfuI person, basically.

565
00:31:19,791 --> 00:31:22,419
I haven't slept in days.

566
00:31:22,494 --> 00:31:26,328
What we did was so wrong
on so many levels.

567
00:31:26,431 --> 00:31:29,127
And it was so right
on a couple of levels, too.

568
00:31:29,201 --> 00:31:30,327
Admit it.

569
00:31:30,402 --> 00:31:31,494
No, it wasn't.

570
00:31:31,603 --> 00:31:33,332
On no levels was it right.

571
00:31:33,438 --> 00:31:36,202
You can't say we didn't
enjoy each other's company.

572
00:31:36,308 --> 00:31:38,538
Sitting at the bar, dancing.

573
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:40,805
After dancing. Come on.

574
00:31:40,879 --> 00:31:43,006
You and I haven't had fun
like that in 100 years.

575
00:31:43,114 --> 00:31:47,016
Yes, because we're not
supposed to have fun like that.

576
00:31:47,118 --> 00:31:49,109
We are divorced.

577
00:31:51,022 --> 00:31:55,482
Are you, like, what, unhappy at
home? Does she not understand you?

578
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:58,859
Or did you just want to know what
it would be like with someone my age?

579
00:31:58,964 --> 00:32:00,329
What is this?

580
00:32:00,398 --> 00:32:02,832
I'd be Iying if I said I
never think about you, Janey.

581
00:32:02,901 --> 00:32:05,893
I think about you a lot.

582
00:32:06,004 --> 00:32:10,304
And, no, it's not perfect at
home, obviously. Look at me.

583
00:32:10,375 --> 00:32:13,173
I've got three grown kids and I'm
going to kindergarten interviews.

584
00:32:13,245 --> 00:32:14,735
I'm a walking cliché.

585
00:32:14,846 --> 00:32:18,373
And I can't, literally,
can't stop thinking

586
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:20,680
about what happened
in New York.

587
00:32:20,752 --> 00:32:24,916
Fate brought us together
once, maybe it happened again.

588
00:32:25,023 --> 00:32:28,754
And I know you've moved on
with your life, I get it.

589
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:32,990
BBut you can't deny that something
reaI and honest happened that night.

590
00:32:33,064 --> 00:32:35,658
Can't we just go with it?
See where it takes us?

591
00:32:35,734 --> 00:32:37,531
No one has to know.

592
00:32:37,602 --> 00:32:38,626
Wow.

593
00:32:38,703 --> 00:32:41,536
You were so great,
so loose and sexy.

594
00:32:41,606 --> 00:32:44,575
How often do you get
to be like that?

595
00:32:44,676 --> 00:32:46,769
You can run and
open restaurants

596
00:32:46,845 --> 00:32:49,507
and build your
perfect kitchen.

597
00:32:49,581 --> 00:32:54,712
BBut what about having someone to
hold you in the middle of the night?

598
00:32:54,786 --> 00:32:57,277
Not high on
my list these days.

599
00:32:57,389 --> 00:33:00,085
What if that someone is
someone who's known you

600
00:33:00,191 --> 00:33:02,022
since you were 23?

601
00:33:03,194 --> 00:33:04,684
And loved you

602
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:07,425
for most of your life.

603
00:33:07,699 --> 00:33:09,599
Oh, man!

604
00:33:11,703 --> 00:33:14,570
I forgot what
a good lawyer you are.

605
00:33:14,639 --> 00:33:16,937
Give this a shot, Janey.

606
00:33:17,475 --> 00:33:19,875
Life is short
and it's tough.

607
00:33:19,944 --> 00:33:22,242
Don't discount what
we have together.

608
00:33:22,314 --> 00:33:23,941
You know what they say,

609
00:33:24,049 --> 00:33:27,143
"People who live in nursing
homes that have plants live longer

610
00:33:27,986 --> 00:33:30,045
"than the people
without plants. "

611
00:33:30,121 --> 00:33:33,613
So you're saying this is
a healthy choice for me?

612
00:33:33,725 --> 00:33:36,717
Honey, I know it is.

613
00:33:49,708 --> 00:33:53,474
Oh, God! Oh, God!
It's officiaI.

614
00:33:53,578 --> 00:33:56,274
We're
having an affair.

615
00:33:56,915 --> 00:33:59,213
Why do you need
to labeI everything?

616
00:33:59,284 --> 00:34:02,720
BBecause that's what this is.

617
00:34:02,787 --> 00:34:06,814
Yes, in its crassest form maybe,
if we were two other people.

618
00:34:07,959 --> 00:34:09,950
Just because we were
married for 19 years

619
00:34:10,028 --> 00:34:12,428
does not not
make this an affair.

620
00:34:12,497 --> 00:34:17,958
Okay, but since we were together for
so long, it's not really that wrong.

621
00:34:18,069 --> 00:34:21,334
Really? You want to run
that logic by your wife?

622
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,843
Okay, will you
do me a favor?

623
00:34:30,949 --> 00:34:32,041
You're on my side.
Can we switch?

624
00:34:32,117 --> 00:34:35,314
I'm feeling a little,
uh, disoriented.

625
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:37,320
Since when is this your
side? Since 10 years ago.

626
00:34:37,422 --> 00:34:39,253
Come on, just... Please?

627
00:34:42,193 --> 00:34:43,683
Can I interest
you in a little...

628
00:34:43,795 --> 00:34:45,626
No.

629
00:34:50,835 --> 00:34:55,704
Why do you think the sex
is so much sexier this time?

630
00:34:56,708 --> 00:34:58,335
I don't know.

631
00:35:03,348 --> 00:35:05,839
I got to go to work.

632
00:35:06,284 --> 00:35:09,344
Okay. Me, too.

633
00:35:18,029 --> 00:35:20,554
You see what happens when
you're not looking out for me.

634
00:35:20,665 --> 00:35:24,157
She lets me eat everything.
Pasta, cream cheese.

635
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:28,200
Would you hand me
my robe, please?

636
00:35:30,041 --> 00:35:32,566
And, um, turn around.

637
00:35:32,677 --> 00:35:35,237
Why do I have to, uh, turn around?

638
00:35:35,346 --> 00:35:36,677
BBecause the last
time you saw me

639
00:35:36,748 --> 00:35:39,683
standing up naked
I was in my 40s.

640
00:35:41,186 --> 00:35:44,155
Things look different
Iying down. Just...

641
00:35:44,222 --> 00:35:46,315
You've
gotten kind of nuts.

642
00:35:46,391 --> 00:35:48,655
Yeah.
You know what, Jake,

643
00:35:48,726 --> 00:35:50,523
I think it would be
really good for us

644
00:35:50,595 --> 00:35:54,190
to just not talk
for a couple of days.

645
00:35:54,265 --> 00:35:57,359
You know what I think,
just for the record?

646
00:35:58,102 --> 00:36:00,536
I think we're doing
something kind of brilliant.

647
00:36:00,605 --> 00:36:03,335
All the things that tore us
apart aren't issues anymore.

648
00:36:03,408 --> 00:36:07,435
I'd say our problems
actually went away.

649
00:36:07,545 --> 00:36:08,603
What?

650
00:36:08,713 --> 00:36:11,011
Didn't you always say you
felt you weren't being heard?

651
00:36:11,082 --> 00:36:12,845
Wasn't that our big issue?

652
00:36:12,917 --> 00:36:16,250
BBoth of us always feeling
rejected and unappreciated.

653
00:36:16,354 --> 00:36:19,414
Look at us now. You're
so much more together.

654
00:36:20,225 --> 00:36:21,624
You're not exhausted
all the time.

655
00:36:21,726 --> 00:36:22,886
You're not catering
every weekend

656
00:36:22,961 --> 00:36:24,656
or busy all day
with the kids.

657
00:36:24,729 --> 00:36:27,960
And I'm calmer.
Not as obsessed with work.

658
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:30,759
I'm a partner. I'm there.

659
00:36:30,869 --> 00:36:34,361
We both grew into the people
we wanted each other to be.

660
00:36:34,439 --> 00:36:35,701
Really?

661
00:36:36,774 --> 00:36:40,642
Well, you're better than I am at
remembering all the details of our...

662
00:36:40,745 --> 00:36:43,077
Do you remember never
having time for sex?

663
00:36:43,147 --> 00:36:44,614
Now look at us.

664
00:36:44,716 --> 00:36:47,651
We've already done it two times
this week and it's only Tuesday.

665
00:36:47,752 --> 00:36:50,277
I swear to God, if half
the people who got divorced

666
00:36:50,388 --> 00:36:52,219
got back together
after 10 years,

667
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:54,451
their problems
would be solved.

668
00:36:54,559 --> 00:36:55,787
I think we're
on to something.

669
00:36:55,894 --> 00:36:58,488
Not sure
I agree with that.

670
00:36:58,563 --> 00:37:00,531
And, also, we are
not back together.

671
00:37:00,598 --> 00:37:03,761
And I know other divorced
people think about this.

672
00:37:03,835 --> 00:37:05,826
They wonder, "What if?"

673
00:37:06,604 --> 00:37:10,665
You know, I think this
is very French of us.

674
00:37:10,775 --> 00:37:14,142
How is
it French of us?

675
00:37:14,245 --> 00:37:19,148
I have a young wife but I am
having sex with my old wife.

676
00:37:20,451 --> 00:37:24,751
Not old. You know, "ex. "
I didn't mean "old. "

677
00:37:26,424 --> 00:37:27,584
You're doing that
thing when you act

678
00:37:27,659 --> 00:37:28,785
like you're not
listening to me,

679
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:31,761
but think about
what I said, okay?

680
00:37:31,829 --> 00:37:33,160
You got any of your
homemade granola here?

681
00:37:33,264 --> 00:37:34,959
It's been so long
since I had any.

682
00:37:35,033 --> 00:37:36,125
Oh, you miss it?

683
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,258
So much.

684
00:37:37,335 --> 00:37:39,803
We sell it for 6.50
a bag at the store.

685
00:37:39,871 --> 00:37:43,864
Yeah, well, why give
it away when you can...

686
00:37:43,975 --> 00:37:45,408
God!

687
00:37:45,476 --> 00:37:46,738
Ooh. Kiss goodbye?

688
00:37:46,811 --> 00:37:48,005
Mmm.

689
00:37:48,112 --> 00:37:52,105
Ooh!
She wants to be courted.

690
00:37:52,817 --> 00:37:55,843
I can do that. Oh, honey,
thanks for the coffee.

691
00:37:55,954 --> 00:37:57,319
Oh, God!

692
00:38:02,961 --> 00:38:04,895
Oh, my God! Now what?

693
00:38:04,996 --> 00:38:07,521
Three pies?
Oh, this is a feast!

694
00:38:07,632 --> 00:38:11,363
I don't know what's got into me
lately, but I have so much energy...

695
00:38:12,704 --> 00:38:15,172
...which is probably the result
of all the sex I've been having.

696
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:20,837
I'm actually not kidding.

697
00:38:22,547 --> 00:38:24,481
I'm having an affair.

698
00:38:26,784 --> 00:38:28,217
With a married man.

699
00:38:28,319 --> 00:38:29,718
What?

700
00:38:30,622 --> 00:38:31,611
When did
this happen?

701
00:38:31,689 --> 00:38:33,213
Where did you meet him?

702
00:38:33,324 --> 00:38:36,816
"Where did I... "
Well, it started in New York.

703
00:38:36,894 --> 00:38:37,918
New York, last week?

704
00:38:37,996 --> 00:38:38,985
Mmm-hmm.

705
00:38:39,063 --> 00:38:42,328
We did it once there
and once here.

706
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:45,460
Or maybe, maybe more
than once there.

707
00:38:45,536 --> 00:38:47,561
I don't know.
I was drunk, so I'm...

708
00:38:47,639 --> 00:38:49,869
You had drunken sex with
a married man in New York

709
00:38:49,974 --> 00:38:52,033
when you went back
for Luke's graduation?

710
00:38:52,143 --> 00:38:55,635
Yeah. Turns out,
I'm a bit of a slut.

711
00:38:55,713 --> 00:38:57,681
Apple, blueberry or plum?

712
00:38:57,749 --> 00:39:00,081
Wait, wait,
wait, wait. Hold on.

713
00:39:00,184 --> 00:39:02,379
You're not saying...

714
00:39:04,055 --> 00:39:05,044
What?

715
00:39:05,123 --> 00:39:06,181
No! You're not!

716
00:39:06,257 --> 00:39:08,487
Oh, yes, I am.

717
00:39:09,327 --> 00:39:12,660
I am having an affair with
Agness Adler's husband.

718
00:39:14,198 --> 00:39:16,758
Oh, God!
You're not.

719
00:39:16,868 --> 00:39:19,428
That is genius.

720
00:39:19,904 --> 00:39:23,101
Well, it's also
sort of wrong.

721
00:39:23,408 --> 00:39:25,376
I know. I know.

722
00:39:25,443 --> 00:39:27,172
Oh, please,
it's not that wrong.

723
00:39:27,245 --> 00:39:31,705
BBut I'm... I'm so happy
to be able to tell somebody.

724
00:39:32,717 --> 00:39:36,414
This is the most out-of-controI
thing I've ever done in my life!

725
00:39:36,521 --> 00:39:37,886
Literally! You know me.

726
00:39:37,955 --> 00:39:39,252
Yes!
Yes! We do.

727
00:39:39,357 --> 00:39:40,688
You've never done
anything wrong

728
00:39:40,758 --> 00:39:41,884
or bad ever.
No.

729
00:39:41,959 --> 00:39:43,256
Ever!

730
00:39:43,327 --> 00:39:44,919
So,
you're allowed this one.

731
00:39:45,763 --> 00:39:46,787
Well...

732
00:39:46,864 --> 00:39:48,525
I'm sorry.
I kind of love it!

733
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:50,260
And he was yours first.

734
00:39:50,334 --> 00:39:51,392
True.

735
00:39:52,036 --> 00:39:53,867
Not that I want him back, by the way.

736
00:39:53,938 --> 00:39:55,064
Of course not.
Oh, man.

737
00:39:55,139 --> 00:39:57,607
You can do better than Jake.

738
00:39:57,709 --> 00:39:59,301
Thanks.

739
00:39:59,377 --> 00:40:02,540
No. I mean,
you've outgrown him.

740
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:06,043
You've blossomed. You've
feng shuied your whole life.

741
00:40:06,117 --> 00:40:07,311
Yeah.

742
00:40:07,418 --> 00:40:09,818
Just please don't let him
talk you into saving him.

743
00:40:09,921 --> 00:40:11,548
I won't.

744
00:40:11,622 --> 00:40:14,250
Janey, there's something
perfect about this.

745
00:40:14,325 --> 00:40:16,953
You don't have to cook for
him, or clean up after him.

746
00:40:17,061 --> 00:40:18,926
You don't even actually
have to sleep with him.

747
00:40:18,996 --> 00:40:21,055
I know. I have
an ex with benefits.

748
00:40:22,567 --> 00:40:26,901
BBut, girls, what about the fact
that I'm now the other woman?

749
00:40:26,971 --> 00:40:28,302
I'm the one we hate!

750
00:40:28,406 --> 00:40:31,068
Oh, forget about that. Agness
is still the one we hate,

751
00:40:31,142 --> 00:40:32,336
even in this scenario.

752
00:40:32,443 --> 00:40:35,469
Yeah, karma is the
ultimate bitch in this one.

753
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:36,740
Let's hope so.

754
00:40:36,814 --> 00:40:38,748
Okay, tell me everything! You're
not getting away with anything.

755
00:40:38,816 --> 00:40:39,840
You tell me everything.

756
00:40:39,917 --> 00:40:42,647
I want details. Details,
details. No, you earned this...

757
00:40:44,155 --> 00:40:45,144
Reynaldo!

758
00:40:45,223 --> 00:40:46,520
Mmm?

759
00:40:46,591 --> 00:40:49,151
I want to change
the breakfast menu.

760
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:52,627
Give it more life.
What do you think?

761
00:40:52,697 --> 00:40:54,858
What did you do,
something to your hair?

762
00:40:54,966 --> 00:40:56,399
No, I don't think so.

763
00:40:56,467 --> 00:40:58,128
Something about you
looks different.

764
00:40:58,202 --> 00:40:59,760
A little more caliente?

765
00:40:59,837 --> 00:41:01,065
Caliente?

766
00:41:01,139 --> 00:41:02,333
You see it, Eddie?

767
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:04,135
Whatever it is,
it's working.

768
00:41:05,843 --> 00:41:09,836
Hello? Oh, no, I didn't do this again.

769
00:41:10,381 --> 00:41:13,373
Adam,
I'm so sorry.

770
00:41:14,352 --> 00:41:17,651
My mind is just...
Forgive me.

771
00:41:17,722 --> 00:41:19,383
You know, if I were
your shrink, I'd say

772
00:41:19,490 --> 00:41:20,957
maybe you don't really
want to build this addition.

773
00:41:21,025 --> 00:41:23,687
Oh, no, no,
that's completely not true.

774
00:41:23,795 --> 00:41:24,955
I'm really sorry.

775
00:41:25,029 --> 00:41:26,155
It's okay.

776
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:29,825
Oh, I like it already.

777
00:41:29,901 --> 00:41:33,735
Yeah, it's feeling really good.
So, this becomes your office.

778
00:41:33,838 --> 00:41:34,862
Uh-huh.

779
00:41:34,939 --> 00:41:36,497
You come down
your new hallway.

780
00:41:36,574 --> 00:41:38,838
The windows all along here.
Okay.

781
00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:40,537
Great. Love it!

782
00:41:40,645 --> 00:41:44,741
And from here to there... Well,
let me get the door for you.

783
00:41:47,485 --> 00:41:48,850
Your kitchen.

784
00:41:50,388 --> 00:41:53,380
We're in the eating area now.
How's the size feeI?

785
00:41:53,491 --> 00:41:54,515
Good.

786
00:41:54,592 --> 00:41:56,389
Right now, we're at
either end of the table.

787
00:41:56,494 --> 00:41:59,224
Oh!
Well, it feels perfect!

788
00:41:59,330 --> 00:42:00,524
I thought so, too.

789
00:42:00,598 --> 00:42:03,431
Yeah. Oh!

790
00:42:06,237 --> 00:42:07,534
This is heaven!

791
00:42:07,605 --> 00:42:09,095
It's gonna be cooI.

792
00:42:10,741 --> 00:42:11,935
You wanna go upstairs?

793
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:18,578
Oh!

794
00:42:18,683 --> 00:42:22,244
So if you were Iying in bed,
this would be your view.

795
00:42:22,353 --> 00:42:23,615
Oh!

796
00:42:34,532 --> 00:42:36,295
Oh, gosh!
Are you all right?

797
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,631
Mmm-hmm. Yeah.
I'm fine. I'm...

798
00:42:42,773 --> 00:42:44,638
Janey?
Call me.

799
00:42:57,588 --> 00:42:58,748
Jake!

800
00:42:58,823 --> 00:43:00,154
Coming!

801
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:04,560
What were you
doing in there?

802
00:43:04,629 --> 00:43:05,721
Going to the bathroom.

803
00:43:05,796 --> 00:43:07,161
The toilet isn't flushed.

804
00:43:07,265 --> 00:43:08,254
Yes, it did.

805
00:43:08,332 --> 00:43:09,390
Why were you in the shower

806
00:43:09,467 --> 00:43:11,401
with your clothes on?

807
00:43:11,469 --> 00:43:14,666
What are
you talking about?

808
00:43:14,772 --> 00:43:17,240
I heard the shower
door close, Jake.

809
00:43:17,308 --> 00:43:18,935
What do you have,
x- ray ears?

810
00:43:19,010 --> 00:43:20,477
Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

811
00:43:20,578 --> 00:43:22,068
What's up, Pedro?

812
00:43:22,146 --> 00:43:25,013
Jake took a shower
with his clothes on.

813
00:43:26,851 --> 00:43:28,182
Oh, Pedro, darling.

814
00:43:28,286 --> 00:43:29,310
Well, what's he
talking about?

815
00:43:29,387 --> 00:43:30,581
I don't speak Pedro.

816
00:43:30,655 --> 00:43:32,520
That's your department.

817
00:43:32,623 --> 00:43:35,251
Don't go in the kitchen, P.
I broke something.

818
00:43:35,326 --> 00:43:37,487
Yo, can you help?

819
00:43:37,561 --> 00:43:38,789
Yo, can you?

820
00:43:44,535 --> 00:43:45,695
That looks amazing.

821
00:43:45,803 --> 00:43:48,601
It's called
croque-monsieur.

822
00:43:48,673 --> 00:43:52,268
It was the first thing I learned
to make when I was living in Paris

823
00:43:52,343 --> 00:43:54,368
because the ingredients
are really, really cheap.

824
00:43:54,478 --> 00:43:55,877
When did you
live in Paris?

825
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:58,847
When I was in
my early 20s.

826
00:43:58,950 --> 00:44:01,680
I went there to take
a six-day pastry class,

827
00:44:01,752 --> 00:44:02,946
and I ended up
staying a year

828
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:05,648
working as an apprentice
in a bakery.

829
00:44:05,723 --> 00:44:07,054
Wow, that's brave.

830
00:44:10,294 --> 00:44:12,558
Thank you for taking
my 47 e-mails

831
00:44:12,630 --> 00:44:14,860
and turning them into
something so beautifuI.

832
00:44:14,966 --> 00:44:16,331
You are rapidly becoming

833
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,163
one of the most appreciative
clients I've ever had.

834
00:44:18,235 --> 00:44:20,863
I don't know
what it is but I...

835
00:44:21,539 --> 00:44:24,030
I'm always surprised when
I can count on someone.

836
00:44:25,476 --> 00:44:27,376
Really?
Yeah.

837
00:44:41,659 --> 00:44:44,890
I know it's none of my
business, but I was just

838
00:44:44,996 --> 00:44:48,022
trying to figure out why
someone like you is divorced.

839
00:44:48,099 --> 00:44:49,828
And what did
you come up with?

840
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:52,368
Something in the "you're
too nice" department.

841
00:44:52,436 --> 00:44:55,405
That, and my wife fell in
love with my best friend.

842
00:44:55,506 --> 00:44:58,066
Oh! No.
Ex-best friend.

843
00:44:58,175 --> 00:45:00,905
We were on a biking trip, he
and his wife and me and my wife,

844
00:45:01,012 --> 00:45:04,175
through Tuscany, and on
the last day of the trip,

845
00:45:04,248 --> 00:45:05,613
they announced that
they were in love.

846
00:45:05,716 --> 00:45:07,707
How awfuI!

847
00:45:07,785 --> 00:45:09,082
Not a great
plane ride home.

848
00:45:09,153 --> 00:45:11,621
Oh! I can just imagine.

849
00:45:11,722 --> 00:45:13,485
Sitting there
for hours and hours

850
00:45:13,557 --> 00:45:15,388
with your wife,
who you know is...

851
00:45:15,459 --> 00:45:16,483
Oh, that's rough.

852
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:18,050
Well, actually,
they went on to Venice.

853
00:45:18,129 --> 00:45:20,256
I flew home with CaroI,
that's his ex-wife.

854
00:45:20,364 --> 00:45:23,390
And you can't imagine what it's
like sitting next to someone

855
00:45:23,467 --> 00:45:26,095
who's crying on a plane
for 10 straight hours.

856
00:45:26,203 --> 00:45:27,295
I don't blame her.

857
00:45:27,371 --> 00:45:28,395
I'm talking about me.

858
00:45:30,775 --> 00:45:31,799
BBut anyway,
they're married now,

859
00:45:31,876 --> 00:45:34,606
and it's pretty much
an ongoing awfuI thing.

860
00:45:34,712 --> 00:45:36,339
BBut you and your ex,
when he stopped by

861
00:45:36,414 --> 00:45:37,904
the other morning
for coffee,

862
00:45:37,982 --> 00:45:40,542
I thought, "Wow. That's the
way it's supposed to be. "

863
00:45:40,618 --> 00:45:42,381
You two really seem
to have it figured out.

864
00:45:42,453 --> 00:45:46,048
Well... Yeah. We're not as
figured out as you'd think.

865
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:07,242
I hope you don't think that
I've been interrogating you,

866
00:46:07,311 --> 00:46:10,610
but I know what it's like
to have an ex who's remarried

867
00:46:10,681 --> 00:46:13,479
and not have that much
going on in that area.

868
00:46:13,584 --> 00:46:16,849
I mean,
do you date ever? Or...

869
00:46:16,954 --> 00:46:19,354
Oh, constantly, actually.

870
00:46:19,457 --> 00:46:20,481
Constantly? Really?

871
00:46:20,558 --> 00:46:21,820
Yeah. Everyone I know

872
00:46:21,926 --> 00:46:23,826
or have ever known
has fixed me up

873
00:46:23,894 --> 00:46:25,191
and sometimes
I just meet women.

874
00:46:25,262 --> 00:46:27,253
I don't really know
how it happens, but...

875
00:46:27,331 --> 00:46:30,129
BBut
no girlfriend yet?

876
00:46:30,201 --> 00:46:31,259
Not yet.

877
00:46:31,335 --> 00:46:33,303
Mmm-hmm.
Just like dating.

878
00:46:33,871 --> 00:46:35,805
Actually, I find it
really stressfuI.

879
00:46:35,873 --> 00:46:39,036
You know, the last time I was
in the dating world was 1978.

880
00:46:40,277 --> 00:46:41,471
And it's so much more
complicated these days.

881
00:46:41,545 --> 00:46:42,603
Oh, I know.

882
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:43,704
I can't tell you
how nice it is

883
00:46:43,781 --> 00:46:45,146
to have a conversation
with a woman

884
00:46:45,216 --> 00:46:49,050
and have the pressure off,
not to mention a home-cooked...

885
00:46:49,153 --> 00:46:50,882
That was
a compliment.

886
00:46:50,988 --> 00:46:52,546
Yeah.

887
00:46:52,656 --> 00:46:54,817
Do you have a guy in your
life at... At the moment?

888
00:46:54,892 --> 00:46:56,655
No.
No?

889
00:46:56,727 --> 00:46:58,695
No.

890
00:47:29,093 --> 00:47:31,254
This was so nice
and relaxing.

891
00:47:31,362 --> 00:47:34,160
And the lavender ice cream was
the best dessert of any sort

892
00:47:34,231 --> 00:47:36,199
I've ever had,
like, in my life.

893
00:47:36,267 --> 00:47:37,461
Aw! Oh! Thanks.

894
00:47:37,535 --> 00:47:39,503
I always make ice cream
when I can't sleep,

895
00:47:39,570 --> 00:47:41,094
so I'm glad someone
was here to eat it.

896
00:47:42,673 --> 00:47:43,867
Great getting to
know you a little.

897
00:47:43,941 --> 00:47:46,842
Yeah, it was really fun.

898
00:47:47,578 --> 00:47:49,512
Well...

899
00:47:52,616 --> 00:47:53,674
BBye. Okay.

900
00:47:53,751 --> 00:47:55,275
BBye.

901
00:48:00,691 --> 00:48:01,851
BBye.

902
00:48:14,271 --> 00:48:17,035
What? I'm coming.

903
00:48:21,445 --> 00:48:24,209
O.M.G., I thought
he'd never leave.

904
00:48:25,983 --> 00:48:27,610
Hello, Jane.
Hi.

905
00:48:27,718 --> 00:48:29,447
You're looking very
beautifuI tonight.

906
00:48:30,921 --> 00:48:32,149
Oh, I love when you
smell like butter.

907
00:48:32,223 --> 00:48:33,554
What are you doing here?

908
00:48:33,624 --> 00:48:34,955
Missed you.
Mmm-hmm.

909
00:48:35,059 --> 00:48:37,994
It's 9:00. Where does
your wife think you are?

910
00:48:38,329 --> 00:48:41,423
Yoga. Shall we do some
downward-facing dog, perhaps?

911
00:48:41,498 --> 00:48:43,591
Not tonight, big guy.

912
00:48:43,667 --> 00:48:44,998
Is it really
necessary for you

913
00:48:45,069 --> 00:48:47,731
to always say no
before you say yes?

914
00:48:47,805 --> 00:48:49,432
I'm not gonna think
less of you, you know.

915
00:48:49,506 --> 00:48:51,804
Really, Jake.
I'm a little tired

916
00:48:51,875 --> 00:48:54,241
and I was gonna
take a bath, and just...

917
00:48:54,311 --> 00:48:57,246
Okay. So we'll
just hang out.

918
00:48:57,314 --> 00:48:59,782
Is that
croque-monsieur?

919
00:48:59,850 --> 00:49:00,908
Yeah.

920
00:49:00,985 --> 00:49:03,010
Whose plate is this,
yours or his? That's mine.

921
00:49:05,522 --> 00:49:07,922
My God! Just like
I remember it.

922
00:49:08,692 --> 00:49:11,627
Don't you ever eat
at your house?

923
00:49:11,695 --> 00:49:15,153
Pedro dictates most meals,
and he has a very

924
00:49:15,266 --> 00:49:16,927
limited palate.
Mmm-hmm.

925
00:49:17,001 --> 00:49:18,229
What kind of
ice cream is that?

926
00:49:18,302 --> 00:49:19,735
Lavender honey.

927
00:49:19,803 --> 00:49:20,963
Not sleeping?

928
00:49:21,038 --> 00:49:23,029
Not at all. You?

929
00:49:24,375 --> 00:49:26,036
Never slept better.
Mmm-hmm.

930
00:49:26,143 --> 00:49:29,203
And my digestion is
finally back on track.

931
00:49:29,313 --> 00:49:32,282
You've turned my world
right-side up, Jane.

932
00:49:32,883 --> 00:49:35,943
You know what
that means, don't you?

933
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:38,284
No.

934
00:49:40,724 --> 00:49:44,626
That I've never really known
how to live without you.

935
00:49:52,503 --> 00:49:56,064
You know, maybe we should
be growing old together.

936
00:49:56,173 --> 00:50:03,136
I hate to tell you, big guy,
we already grew old, apart.

937
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:04,574
What is with the "big guy"?

938
00:50:04,682 --> 00:50:08,379
Is it because I'm fat, or
is it a term of endearment?

939
00:50:08,452 --> 00:50:12,286
I have no idea why I keep saying
that. I'm sorry. I'll stop.

940
00:50:12,389 --> 00:50:13,754
Thank you.

941
00:50:15,592 --> 00:50:17,082
I love how quiet
it is in your house.

942
00:50:17,161 --> 00:50:18,594
Mmm.

943
00:50:19,596 --> 00:50:22,793
I have no quiet
in my life. Ever.

944
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:25,800
Well, you live
with a 5-year-old.

945
00:50:25,903 --> 00:50:28,133
Yes. And let's
not forget Pedro.

946
00:50:31,942 --> 00:50:37,278
What are you saying, exactly? What's
going on over there at your place?

947
00:50:41,318 --> 00:50:43,252
My marriage is

948
00:50:44,388 --> 00:50:47,448
not turning out as I
hoped. That's obvious.

949
00:50:47,558 --> 00:50:52,291
Agness started out really looking
up to me. We never used to fight.

950
00:50:52,396 --> 00:50:54,091
BBut now with
the kid, lately,

951
00:50:54,164 --> 00:50:56,826
we're all about what
schooI he's going to

952
00:50:56,934 --> 00:51:00,233
and she thinks we need a
bigger house, more help.

953
00:51:00,304 --> 00:51:02,295
I was hoping to
cut back at work,

954
00:51:02,373 --> 00:51:04,341
but now that's
never gonna happen.

955
00:51:04,441 --> 00:51:05,465
And she wants to
have another baby

956
00:51:05,542 --> 00:51:08,033
before Pedro gets
too old, which I get.

957
00:51:08,112 --> 00:51:10,774
BBut since we're
always fighting...

958
00:51:10,881 --> 00:51:13,441
Oh, God.
Listen to me.

959
00:51:14,818 --> 00:51:17,719
Isn't a baby part of the deaI
when you marry a woman that age?

960
00:51:17,788 --> 00:51:20,552
Is it? I guess so.

961
00:51:21,091 --> 00:51:24,424
She's got me booked at the
fertility center every other day,

962
00:51:24,495 --> 00:51:27,225
and she is so amped up
on hormone injections,

963
00:51:27,297 --> 00:51:30,061
I'm gonna have to find an
exorcist if she doesn't calm down.

964
00:51:32,136 --> 00:51:34,001
I wish it was funny.

965
00:51:35,105 --> 00:51:36,333
Incredible ice cream.

966
00:51:36,407 --> 00:51:37,601
Hmm.

967
00:51:37,674 --> 00:51:40,074
I'm turning around.

968
00:51:40,144 --> 00:51:43,079
Hey, remember when
we used to smoke pot

969
00:51:43,147 --> 00:51:45,206
and eat your ice cream
in the hot tub?

970
00:51:45,282 --> 00:51:50,515
The hot tub? That feels
like a billion years ago.

971
00:51:50,621 --> 00:51:53,249
Yeah. How long has
it been since you, uh...

972
00:51:54,525 --> 00:51:57,585
Me? Since before
Lauren was born.

973
00:51:57,661 --> 00:51:58,992
Twenty-seven years.

974
00:51:59,062 --> 00:52:00,188
At least.

975
00:52:00,264 --> 00:52:01,424
Huh?

976
00:52:03,333 --> 00:52:07,861
Are you kidding me? Oh, put that
away. Oh! It's been too long.

977
00:52:07,971 --> 00:52:09,802
Exactly.
I'm not gonna...

978
00:52:09,873 --> 00:52:13,775
Okay. I'm gonna leave this
for you. It's kind of amazing.

979
00:52:13,844 --> 00:52:17,302
You take a few hits,
get your sea legs back,

980
00:52:17,381 --> 00:52:20,043
and, uh, we'll finish
the rest of it together.

981
00:52:20,117 --> 00:52:21,277
Maybe.

982
00:52:21,351 --> 00:52:25,481
So, that nerdy architect likes
you. You know that, right?

983
00:52:25,556 --> 00:52:27,490
He's not nerdy.

984
00:52:27,558 --> 00:52:29,992
And he definitely doesn't.

985
00:52:30,060 --> 00:52:31,550
We're just...
We're working together.

986
00:52:31,662 --> 00:52:34,654
I was watching while you
leaned over to open the oven,

987
00:52:34,731 --> 00:52:39,031
and his eyes were
glued to your ass.

988
00:52:39,136 --> 00:52:41,070
Hey, do me a favor?

989
00:52:43,507 --> 00:52:46,237
Tell me the truth, Janey. Is
this a great affair or what?

990
00:52:46,310 --> 00:52:49,108
I don't know.
It's my first.

991
00:52:49,179 --> 00:52:52,444
We don't even have to
have sex, and it's fun.

992
00:52:53,684 --> 00:52:54,810
I wish I could sleep over.

993
00:52:54,918 --> 00:52:59,014
I got to talk to my shrink
about this. This is...

994
00:52:59,122 --> 00:53:02,614
This is a lot to handle.
You better go, I guess.

995
00:53:07,431 --> 00:53:08,693
It's okay.

996
00:53:08,799 --> 00:53:10,357
No.

997
00:53:11,134 --> 00:53:13,932
Whoa!
What is happening, Jake?

998
00:53:30,821 --> 00:53:31,845
Don't get it.

999
00:53:31,922 --> 00:53:34,482
I always get it.
I have three kids.

1000
00:53:36,527 --> 00:53:40,224
Hello? Hi. You're still
on the phone?

1001
00:53:41,965 --> 00:53:44,456
Plane,
I meant plane.

1002
00:53:45,302 --> 00:53:48,203
Uh-huh? Well, how was Luke
when you left him?

1003
00:53:48,305 --> 00:53:52,469
Oh, that sounds like fun. Yeah,
let me know what I can bring.

1004
00:53:52,543 --> 00:53:55,569
No! I have no idea
where he is.

1005
00:53:56,647 --> 00:53:58,376
Okay, sweetheart.
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

1006
00:53:58,482 --> 00:54:00,211
Oh! Now I'm Iying.

1007
00:54:01,652 --> 00:54:03,279
Lauren and Harley
are giving Luke

1008
00:54:03,353 --> 00:54:06,652
a graduation party this
weekend. Sweet, huh?

1009
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:12,356
Hello, stranger.
Welcome back.

1010
00:54:13,163 --> 00:54:15,893
I'm, uh, just getting
into my car.

1011
00:54:15,999 --> 00:54:18,627
Yeah, this weekend
sounds great.

1012
00:54:18,702 --> 00:54:20,033
Let me know
what I can bring.

1013
00:54:22,639 --> 00:54:23,663
Okay.

1014
00:54:35,786 --> 00:54:38,812
Why am I laughing?
I mean, it's like nuts!

1015
00:54:48,632 --> 00:54:50,293
Dr. Allen.

1016
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:51,958
Jane, hi.
Am I seeing you today?

1017
00:54:52,069 --> 00:54:54,435
Oh, no. I just wanted to
talk. And I was wondering

1018
00:54:54,538 --> 00:54:57,302
if by any chance you could squeeze
me in for an emergency session?

1019
00:54:57,407 --> 00:55:00,069
BBecause I'm sort of in
desperate need of advice.

1020
00:55:00,143 --> 00:55:02,373
I brought you some
coffee cake that you like.

1021
00:55:02,446 --> 00:55:04,607
Not as a bribe
or anything. BBut...

1022
00:55:04,715 --> 00:55:06,307
I only have 20 minutes
before my first patient.

1023
00:55:06,416 --> 00:55:08,384
Well, that's fine!
I'll talk fast.

1024
00:55:08,452 --> 00:55:13,082
So at this point, I just need
some sound, unbiased guidance.

1025
00:55:14,291 --> 00:55:19,228
Is having an affair with you-know-who
a good thing or a bad thing?

1026
00:55:20,564 --> 00:55:22,998
It's a bad thing, right? This
can't be... How can it be good?

1027
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:25,398
It's not good,
it's not bad.

1028
00:55:27,537 --> 00:55:29,903
I've made a list
of everything

1029
00:55:29,973 --> 00:55:32,874
this could possibly
be about at my end.

1030
00:55:34,645 --> 00:55:35,669
May I read it to you?

1031
00:55:35,746 --> 00:55:37,873
Oh, please, of course.

1032
00:55:38,248 --> 00:55:39,875
Uh...

1033
00:55:39,950 --> 00:55:42,578
BBecause
I e-mailed it to myself.

1034
00:55:44,821 --> 00:55:47,722
Okay. "Am I still trying to
figure out why the marriage failed?

1035
00:55:47,791 --> 00:55:50,157
"Do I want to
get back together?

1036
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:53,093
"Do we have
unfinished business?

1037
00:55:53,163 --> 00:55:56,724
"Is this about revenge?
Or am I...

1038
00:56:04,675 --> 00:56:06,472
"Am I just lonely?

1039
00:56:06,576 --> 00:56:07,873
"Or is it my
caretaker thing?"

1040
00:56:07,944 --> 00:56:09,878
I mean, the kids
are finally gone now,

1041
00:56:09,946 --> 00:56:11,470
and all of
a sudden Jake is back,

1042
00:56:11,548 --> 00:56:14,176
and I get to take care
of him in some way.

1043
00:56:14,251 --> 00:56:18,119
Now, I understand. I get how
therapy works. I really do.

1044
00:56:18,989 --> 00:56:21,981
We look at things, we examine
them. Weeks turn into months.

1045
00:56:22,092 --> 00:56:23,684
And we're going
on eight years now.

1046
00:56:24,961 --> 00:56:27,156
And I'm okay with that.
I really am, believe me.

1047
00:56:27,264 --> 00:56:29,425
I... I like it, I do.

1048
00:56:29,499 --> 00:56:33,526
BBut in this case, I need you
to tell me what you really think.

1049
00:56:33,637 --> 00:56:37,334
Like, "Don't do this. "

1050
00:56:37,441 --> 00:56:39,136
You know,
I'd like you to say,

1051
00:56:39,209 --> 00:56:41,200
"Don't do this.
It's absolutely wrong,"

1052
00:56:41,311 --> 00:56:43,711
or, "Go ahead.
You'll be fine. "

1053
00:56:44,681 --> 00:56:47,514
I actually want to
be told what to do.

1054
00:56:48,285 --> 00:56:50,810
What's interesting is, I'm
already seeing you open up

1055
00:56:50,887 --> 00:56:52,684
more than you have
in some time.

1056
00:56:52,789 --> 00:56:54,848
I'm thinking,
through this affair,

1057
00:56:54,958 --> 00:56:58,394
you may learn to view the
world in a different way.

1058
00:56:59,996 --> 00:57:03,454
I'm sorry, what... I just
need something more concrete.

1059
00:57:03,533 --> 00:57:08,300
I'm... Are you saying that
I should just keep seeing him?

1060
00:57:08,371 --> 00:57:11,238
BBecause honestly,
I think that if the guilt...

1061
00:57:13,577 --> 00:57:17,069
The guilt and the fear could
go away, I could just...

1062
00:57:17,180 --> 00:57:21,344
I could let go a little
bit and, um, you know,

1063
00:57:22,586 --> 00:57:24,417
I could figure this out.

1064
00:57:24,988 --> 00:57:27,149
I wouldn't resist
looking at this.

1065
00:57:28,492 --> 00:57:32,223
Okay. And another way of
saying that might be...

1066
00:57:32,329 --> 00:57:35,025
Let go, Jane.
It can't hurt.

1067
00:57:37,634 --> 00:57:38,760
Thank you.

1068
00:57:46,576 --> 00:57:47,941
Santa BBarbara
Fertility Center,

1069
00:57:48,011 --> 00:57:50,241
will you please hold?
Thank you.

1070
00:57:56,787 --> 00:57:59,221
Jacob Adler?

1071
00:57:59,289 --> 00:58:00,381
Have fun.

1072
00:58:02,459 --> 00:58:05,451
Okay, you know the drill. You can
hang your things in the closet.

1073
00:58:05,562 --> 00:58:08,224
The remote's on the dresser, and
the materials are in the drawer.

1074
00:58:08,298 --> 00:58:10,232
Please deposit your
specimen in the cup,

1075
00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:12,860
and I'll see you
when you're done.

1076
00:58:24,481 --> 00:58:26,346
Hey, where are you?

1077
00:58:26,416 --> 00:58:28,179
Uh,
I'm at the office.

1078
00:58:28,251 --> 00:58:29,309
Want to grab some lunch?

1079
00:58:29,386 --> 00:58:31,081
Absolutely. When?

1080
00:58:31,154 --> 00:58:32,746
Can you do it now?
I have about an hour.

1081
00:58:32,823 --> 00:58:35,053
We could meet at the
Stanhope, get room service.

1082
00:58:36,426 --> 00:58:37,620
I'll be there in 10.

1083
00:58:37,694 --> 00:58:39,559
See you there, Adler.

1084
00:58:43,133 --> 00:58:46,068
She's coming back.

1085
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:51,766
Oh,
I'm not kidding.

1086
00:58:51,842 --> 00:58:54,436
That is exactly what the
guy said. I'm stunned.

1087
00:58:54,511 --> 00:58:56,069
Look at me.
I'm still stunned.

1088
00:58:56,146 --> 00:58:57,841
Oh, by the way, I talked
to my brother this morning

1089
00:58:57,948 --> 00:58:59,006
and he is so excited
about his party.

1090
00:58:59,082 --> 00:59:00,071
Really?

1091
00:59:00,150 --> 00:59:01,276
Mmm-hmm.
Great!

1092
00:59:01,351 --> 00:59:03,444
We can fit 40 people
in our place, can't we?

1093
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:05,613
Absolutely.
People won't sit down, but...

1094
00:59:06,990 --> 00:59:08,184
No big deaI, right?

1095
00:59:08,291 --> 00:59:10,156
Hi. Reservation. The name is Adler.

1096
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:11,520
Hey. There's your...

1097
00:59:11,595 --> 00:59:12,687
My what?

1098
00:59:12,829 --> 00:59:13,955
And here's your key.

1099
00:59:18,001 --> 00:59:18,990
Harley!

1100
00:59:19,069 --> 00:59:20,263
I'm really sorry, I
didn't mean to spit on you.

1101
00:59:20,837 --> 00:59:22,805
I just had to kiss you.
While you were choking?

1102
00:59:22,873 --> 00:59:24,670
Yeah, but it worked. 'Cause
I'm not really choking anymore.

1103
00:59:24,774 --> 00:59:26,503
Who did you just see?

1104
00:59:26,610 --> 00:59:27,872
No one. That was weird.

1105
00:59:27,978 --> 00:59:33,780
I thought it was your cousin
from... From... Oh, my sweet lord.

1106
00:59:34,217 --> 00:59:35,275
Now what?

1107
00:59:35,352 --> 00:59:36,341
Honey, I just totally forgot.

1108
00:59:36,453 --> 00:59:38,387
I have
a conference call at 1:15.

1109
00:59:38,488 --> 00:59:39,682
BBack at the office,
so I gotta go.

1110
00:59:39,789 --> 00:59:42,349
Waitress! Honey, I'm serious. Stop
eating. Help me call the waitress.

1111
00:59:42,459 --> 00:59:43,790
Anyone over here. Look
over there. Call that one.

1112
00:59:43,860 --> 00:59:45,191
No. Harley. Harley. Harley.
Harley, we can't leave.

1113
00:59:45,295 --> 00:59:46,489
We're meeting with
the wedding specialist.

1114
00:59:46,563 --> 00:59:47,894
Yeah, and you know what?

1115
00:59:47,998 --> 00:59:51,490
Mmm, I just don't know if today's
the best day for me for that.

1116
00:59:52,502 --> 00:59:54,163
Oh, my God!

1117
00:59:59,209 --> 01:00:02,337
When you just give love

1118
01:00:02,512 --> 01:00:05,572
And never get love

1119
01:00:06,416 --> 01:00:11,854
You'd better let love depart

1120
01:00:13,556 --> 01:00:16,320
I know it's so

1121
01:00:16,927 --> 01:00:20,226
And yet I know

1122
01:00:20,330 --> 01:00:26,200
I can't get you
out of my heart

1123
01:00:32,342 --> 01:00:35,778
You

1124
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:42,609
Made me leave my happy home

1125
01:00:44,287 --> 01:00:49,418
You took my love
and now you're gone

1126
01:00:51,628 --> 01:00:55,860
Since I fell for you

1127
01:01:02,439 --> 01:01:05,033
Your sweet love

1128
01:01:05,542 --> 01:01:07,737
Brings such misery...

1129
01:01:07,811 --> 01:01:11,713
Jake? Jake! Jake!

1130
01:01:12,082 --> 01:01:15,108
I adore October weddings. Let me show
you something we did last October.

1131
01:01:15,218 --> 01:01:16,583
Stunning, right?

1132
01:01:16,653 --> 01:01:17,711
And you can do as
much of the flowers

1133
01:01:17,787 --> 01:01:18,811
or as little
as you want...

1134
01:01:18,888 --> 01:01:20,321
Hey, hon, I'm gonna
make that call from...

1135
01:01:20,423 --> 01:01:21,720
...keeping with an
autumnaI theme. Great.

1136
01:01:21,791 --> 01:01:23,554
This is a gorgeous cake...
You guys just keep doing this,

1137
01:01:23,626 --> 01:01:24,888
and I'm gonna...... with
the chocolate ribbons.

1138
01:01:24,961 --> 01:01:27,122
Oh, I love it.

1139
01:01:28,431 --> 01:01:29,659
Ah! Doctor.

1140
01:01:29,733 --> 01:01:31,530
Hi. I received a call
about a Mr. Adler.

1141
01:01:31,601 --> 01:01:34,764
Yes, 408. His wife
says he's conscious now.

1142
01:01:34,838 --> 01:01:36,271
I'm on my way.

1143
01:01:39,342 --> 01:01:41,310
Okay. BBIood pressure's good.

1144
01:01:41,411 --> 01:01:42,605
How is his heart?

1145
01:01:42,946 --> 01:01:44,243
Do you have a heart
condition, Mr. Adler?

1146
01:01:44,314 --> 01:01:45,906
No. And I just
had a check-up.

1147
01:01:45,982 --> 01:01:47,506
You did? That's good.

1148
01:01:47,617 --> 01:01:49,983
And when you got dizzy, did you
feeI your heart was beating funny?

1149
01:01:50,086 --> 01:01:53,146
Yes. BBut I was
admiring my beautifuI...

1150
01:01:53,623 --> 01:01:55,147
It's nice to hear after all
these years. That's great.

1151
01:01:56,359 --> 01:01:57,951
Did you forget to take
any medications today?

1152
01:01:58,028 --> 01:01:59,825
Took 'em all.
What all did you take?

1153
01:01:59,929 --> 01:02:03,092
Lipitor, baby aspirin.
Flomax.

1154
01:02:05,001 --> 01:02:06,025
Flomax?

1155
01:02:06,102 --> 01:02:09,970
Yes. Otherwise,
I pee 40 times a day.

1156
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:11,803
How long have you
been taking the Flomax?

1157
01:02:11,875 --> 01:02:15,936
Not long. I only take it sporadically.
I have to sneak it, actually.

1158
01:02:16,379 --> 01:02:21,043
It reduces semen, which is not
good for my wife right now. Sorry.

1159
01:02:24,054 --> 01:02:25,112
Really?

1160
01:02:25,188 --> 01:02:27,156
Yes. I prefer
a lot of semen.

1161
01:02:27,457 --> 01:02:29,357
I always have.
Wow.

1162
01:02:29,459 --> 01:02:32,690
Okay, so good.
Thanks so much for coming.

1163
01:02:32,796 --> 01:02:33,820
Looks like
he's going to live.

1164
01:02:33,897 --> 01:02:35,330
Yes. My guess is Flomax

1165
01:02:35,398 --> 01:02:37,457
is probably
the culprit here.

1166
01:02:37,534 --> 01:02:39,468
I suggest you stay off
that for a few weeks.

1167
01:02:39,869 --> 01:02:42,303
Which, apparently,
your wife will appreciate.

1168
01:02:43,373 --> 01:02:44,670
Yeah, really good for me.

1169
01:02:44,741 --> 01:02:45,935
And I suggest
you rest quietly

1170
01:02:46,009 --> 01:02:47,135
for the rest
of the afternoon.

1171
01:02:47,210 --> 01:02:48,472
No hanky-panky, Mrs. Adler.

1172
01:02:48,545 --> 01:02:51,309
No chance,
I can assure you.

1173
01:02:59,322 --> 01:03:02,883
Okay, are you acting like
this because of the wedding?

1174
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:04,857
Tell me the truth.

1175
01:03:04,928 --> 01:03:06,828
Not at all, I swear to God.

1176
01:03:06,896 --> 01:03:08,727
BBecause I really don't want
to be one of those couples

1177
01:03:08,798 --> 01:03:10,129
where the guy
goes into a coma

1178
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:12,191
the whole time we plan the
wedding. God, no. Please.

1179
01:03:12,268 --> 01:03:13,667
It's not
worth it to me.

1180
01:03:15,605 --> 01:03:16,833
He's fine.

1181
01:03:17,774 --> 01:03:19,071
Okay!

1182
01:03:19,175 --> 01:03:22,372
We are back in business!
Oh, honey!

1183
01:03:22,445 --> 01:03:25,710
Don't you just love it
when a song raises you up,

1184
01:03:25,782 --> 01:03:28,273
makes you think
you can do anything

1185
01:03:28,351 --> 01:03:29,818
when all you have
to do is hear it

1186
01:03:29,886 --> 01:03:31,945
and you're motivated,
you're inspired,

1187
01:03:33,189 --> 01:03:34,679
...you don't stop believing...
See? Just that move?

1188
01:03:34,757 --> 01:03:37,920
You have no idea.
Not everyone's like that.

1189
01:03:39,796 --> 01:03:44,233
Jake, I have
a confession to make.

1190
01:03:48,071 --> 01:03:49,800
BBack when we broke up...

1191
01:03:52,408 --> 01:03:54,638
I knew it wasn't
all your fault.

1192
01:03:56,746 --> 01:03:58,737
You mean that? You've never
said that to me before.

1193
01:03:58,815 --> 01:04:00,214
I know.

1194
01:04:01,284 --> 01:04:03,411
BBecause when you cheated,
I didn't have to.

1195
01:04:07,924 --> 01:04:12,987
I think in some way
I gave up on us.

1196
01:04:14,931 --> 01:04:17,126
And I'm not sure
you ever really did.

1197
01:04:19,435 --> 01:04:20,663
I still haven't.

1198
01:04:25,742 --> 01:04:27,767
Are you and Agness
still having sex?

1199
01:04:36,419 --> 01:04:37,579
Only if she initiates it.

1200
01:04:38,855 --> 01:04:40,686
I'm trying not to rock
the boat at home

1201
01:04:40,757 --> 01:04:42,520
untiI you and I
figure this out.

1202
01:04:42,625 --> 01:04:44,684
It's a lot trickier
at my end than yours.

1203
01:04:44,794 --> 01:04:47,695
Right. Yeah. Okay.

1204
01:04:50,667 --> 01:04:52,066
I know you're going to
think I'm leaving now

1205
01:04:52,135 --> 01:04:53,363
because of what
you just said,

1206
01:04:53,436 --> 01:04:55,370
but, I really... I have
to get back to work.

1207
01:05:07,016 --> 01:05:09,780
We got really close
there for a moment.

1208
01:05:17,694 --> 01:05:19,491
Hello?
Hi.

1209
01:05:19,562 --> 01:05:21,359
Adam? I'm not interrupting
anything, am I?

1210
01:05:21,464 --> 01:05:23,193
Hi.

1211
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:26,963
Hey, I just found out there's
a French film festivaI in town

1212
01:05:27,036 --> 01:05:28,867
and made me think of you.

1213
01:05:28,972 --> 01:05:30,303
So I was wondering
if you might want to go

1214
01:05:30,373 --> 01:05:31,897
to the
opening night tomorrow.

1215
01:05:32,008 --> 01:05:34,499
Oh, that sounds so fun!

1216
01:05:34,877 --> 01:05:38,142
Tomorrow night?
Um, let me think.

1217
01:05:38,214 --> 01:05:40,239
Tomorrow night.
Tomorrow's what?

1218
01:05:40,350 --> 01:05:41,476
Say you're busy.

1219
01:05:41,551 --> 01:05:43,075
Agness has got
a dinner thing tomorrow.

1220
01:05:43,186 --> 01:05:44,847
I can come over.

1221
01:05:46,422 --> 01:05:48,253
Come on.

1222
01:05:52,161 --> 01:05:54,857
You know,
I would really love to.

1223
01:05:54,931 --> 01:05:58,059
BBut my son is coming home
from college the next day,

1224
01:05:58,501 --> 01:05:59,866
and I have
a bunch of things

1225
01:05:59,936 --> 01:06:02,063
that I have to do
to get ready.

1226
01:06:02,505 --> 01:06:05,406
I'm really sorry.

1227
01:06:05,942 --> 01:06:07,807
Yeah. It's no problem.
We can...

1228
01:06:07,877 --> 01:06:09,208
Maybe we can see
something another night.

1229
01:06:09,279 --> 01:06:10,906
Absolutely.
I'd love that.

1230
01:06:11,014 --> 01:06:12,379
Take care.
You, too.

1231
01:06:22,025 --> 01:06:23,549
Hey, Melanie, how would
you and your husband

1232
01:06:23,626 --> 01:06:25,753
like two tickets to
the French Film FestivaI?

1233
01:06:25,828 --> 01:06:27,489
Reserved seating,
VIP parking.

1234
01:06:27,563 --> 01:06:29,292
Seriously? Thanks, Adam.

1235
01:06:33,670 --> 01:06:35,604
You'll make the whole thing?
The roast chicken?

1236
01:06:35,705 --> 01:06:39,903
And mashed potatoes.
And sautéed string beans.

1237
01:06:40,443 --> 01:06:42,911
And double fudge
chocolate cake.

1238
01:06:43,546 --> 01:06:46,071
I know your
favorite dinner, Jakey.

1239
01:06:46,616 --> 01:06:48,550
You haven't called me
"Jakey" in 10 years.

1240
01:06:50,420 --> 01:06:53,116
So, do we have a date?

1241
01:06:58,227 --> 01:07:00,252
We have a date.

1242
01:07:49,946 --> 01:07:52,244
Why are you taking your
cell to the bathroom?

1243
01:07:54,083 --> 01:07:56,950
Oh. I didn't mean to.

1244
01:07:57,186 --> 01:07:59,086
Carry him
to his bed, will you?

1245
01:08:00,123 --> 01:08:01,920
Yeah.

1246
01:08:06,763 --> 01:08:09,493
And hurry back.
I'm ovulating.

1247
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:11,624
You are?

1248
01:08:11,701 --> 01:08:12,861
Why do you think
I canceled my dinner?

1249
01:09:34,884 --> 01:09:36,044
Oh, Mom, I keep
forgetting to tell you

1250
01:09:36,118 --> 01:09:37,813
about our meeting
at the Stanhope.

1251
01:09:37,887 --> 01:09:39,377
We went there
for lunch two days ago

1252
01:09:39,455 --> 01:09:40,786
and met with our
wedding specialist,

1253
01:09:40,857 --> 01:09:42,381
and I think
it could be the place.

1254
01:09:42,458 --> 01:09:44,289
Two days ago, you went
to the Stanhope for lunch?

1255
01:09:44,393 --> 01:09:45,519
Yes, we did.

1256
01:09:45,928 --> 01:09:47,054
And we saw nothing.

1257
01:09:47,129 --> 01:09:49,029
Harley, what is that
supposed to mean?

1258
01:09:49,098 --> 01:09:50,622
Who wants wine? Anyone?

1259
01:09:50,733 --> 01:09:54,464
Mom, you have an insane amount
of food in here, even for you.

1260
01:09:54,570 --> 01:09:56,800
Well, I knew everybody
was coming for the weekend,

1261
01:09:56,906 --> 01:09:59,704
so I just made a bunch
of stuff last night.

1262
01:09:59,775 --> 01:10:01,402
Looks like Dad's
favorite meaI.

1263
01:10:01,477 --> 01:10:03,138
Very funny.

1264
01:10:03,212 --> 01:10:04,270
Very.

1265
01:10:05,014 --> 01:10:06,106
Oh, my gosh.

1266
01:10:06,182 --> 01:10:07,672
Yay, he's home.

1267
01:10:07,750 --> 01:10:08,774
Yay.

1268
01:10:09,619 --> 01:10:10,916
Oh, my God.

1269
01:10:13,422 --> 01:10:14,548
Harley.
Yes!

1270
01:10:16,125 --> 01:10:17,820
Hey!
Hi.

1271
01:10:18,261 --> 01:10:19,819
Here he is!
Hi, darling.

1272
01:10:19,896 --> 01:10:21,227
Hi, Mom.

1273
01:10:21,931 --> 01:10:24,058
Mom, this looks amazing!

1274
01:10:24,133 --> 01:10:25,225
Welcome home.

1275
01:10:25,301 --> 01:10:26,825
Thanks.
How you doing?

1276
01:10:26,936 --> 01:10:28,836
Good.
Oh.

1277
01:10:29,338 --> 01:10:30,828
Look at this.

1278
01:10:32,375 --> 01:10:33,433
It smells so good.
I am starving.

1279
01:10:33,509 --> 01:10:34,533
Hi.

1280
01:10:34,610 --> 01:10:36,100
Hey.

1281
01:10:36,178 --> 01:10:37,611
Where should I put this?

1282
01:10:37,680 --> 01:10:38,840
Wherever.

1283
01:10:41,317 --> 01:10:43,217
That looks incredible.

1284
01:10:44,020 --> 01:10:45,647
Thanks.

1285
01:10:46,489 --> 01:10:48,389
Jake, glass of wine?

1286
01:10:48,491 --> 01:10:50,288
Uh, sure, thanks.
Jane?

1287
01:10:50,359 --> 01:10:51,656
No, thank you.

1288
01:10:55,398 --> 01:10:58,231
Hi, Agness.
Just got here.

1289
01:10:58,534 --> 01:11:01,002
Okay, I will.
Yeah. No, I know.

1290
01:11:06,008 --> 01:11:07,270
Sorry, guys,
I gotta hit it.

1291
01:11:07,343 --> 01:11:08,401
BBye-bye.

1292
01:11:08,477 --> 01:11:09,535
I've gotta
stop at the market.

1293
01:11:09,645 --> 01:11:11,112
Agness made
some pasta thing,

1294
01:11:11,180 --> 01:11:12,545
and she ran
out of olive oiI.

1295
01:11:12,648 --> 01:11:14,343
At least she's
finally cooking.

1296
01:11:14,417 --> 01:11:16,977
So, uh, I'll see you guys
at the party tomorrow.

1297
01:11:17,053 --> 01:11:18,816
Yeah. It's gonna be so fun.

1298
01:11:18,888 --> 01:11:20,651
I told you I'm bringing
someone, right?

1299
01:11:20,723 --> 01:11:22,156
No. Who?

1300
01:11:22,224 --> 01:11:24,089
Adam, my architect.

1301
01:11:25,161 --> 01:11:26,560
You're bringing
your architect?

1302
01:11:26,629 --> 01:11:27,789
Yes, I am.

1303
01:11:27,863 --> 01:11:28,852
Like, as a date?

1304
01:11:28,931 --> 01:11:29,920
Yeah.

1305
01:11:29,999 --> 01:11:31,990
I like the idea.
Me, too!

1306
01:11:32,101 --> 01:11:35,366
Yeah, I think it's gonna really
round everything out nicely.

1307
01:11:35,905 --> 01:11:38,271
No one's drinking
wine but me. No?

1308
01:11:38,374 --> 01:11:40,865
Here. Now you can stay
another five minutes.

1309
01:11:40,943 --> 01:11:42,740
Hey. You have three bottles in there.

1310
01:11:42,845 --> 01:11:46,337
Janey, could I speak with
you privately just for a sec?

1311
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:52,553
Okay. Okay.
Yeah...

1312
01:11:55,191 --> 01:11:58,683
All right. I think someone's
talking graduation gift.

1313
01:12:02,865 --> 01:12:04,025
What is it, Jake?

1314
01:12:04,367 --> 01:12:05,959
I don't get not
calling me back.

1315
01:12:06,068 --> 01:12:09,469
Okay, I don't care
what your excuse is.

1316
01:12:09,639 --> 01:12:11,197
So, that's it.

1317
01:12:11,273 --> 01:12:13,798
She didn't go out, Jane.
She changed her plans.

1318
01:12:13,909 --> 01:12:16,639
And every time I tried to
call or write, she caught me.

1319
01:12:16,746 --> 01:12:18,008
I wanted to be here.

1320
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:19,741
You know what?

1321
01:12:21,150 --> 01:12:23,243
You were worried about
rocking the boat at home.

1322
01:12:23,319 --> 01:12:26,117
Well, you're rocking my boat
now. And I don't like it!

1323
01:12:26,222 --> 01:12:28,156
Honey, don't let one
night... You don't understand.

1324
01:12:28,257 --> 01:12:31,556
I'm not... I'm not even blaming
you. I fully participated in this.

1325
01:12:31,627 --> 01:12:33,959
BBut I just don't
want to do it anymore.

1326
01:12:35,631 --> 01:12:36,928
The last thing
in the whole world

1327
01:12:36,999 --> 01:12:39,092
I should be right now
is your mistress.

1328
01:12:39,568 --> 01:12:43,664
Sitting around at 9:00 at
night, wearing heels and perfume

1329
01:12:44,740 --> 01:12:45,798
and blowing all
the candles out

1330
01:12:45,875 --> 01:12:47,342
and wrapping
everything in Saran Wrap

1331
01:12:47,443 --> 01:12:48,910
because your wife
canceled her plans.

1332
01:12:48,978 --> 01:12:53,347
It was just...
It was... humiliating.

1333
01:12:54,083 --> 01:12:55,744
You lit candles?

1334
01:12:56,185 --> 01:12:57,948
Shut up.

1335
01:12:58,020 --> 01:13:01,649
Look, I've had a pretty good
life these past 10 years.

1336
01:13:01,724 --> 01:13:03,282
I have figured it out.

1337
01:13:03,359 --> 01:13:07,523
I no longer feeI alone or
divorced. I just feeI normaI.

1338
01:13:07,630 --> 01:13:11,760
You know how long it took me
to get that balance back?

1339
01:13:13,436 --> 01:13:14,494
No.
No.

1340
01:13:15,805 --> 01:13:18,205
Well, I'm going in
the wrong direction here.

1341
01:13:18,307 --> 01:13:20,571
You know,
the worst part is,

1342
01:13:20,643 --> 01:13:22,270
it feels like
it used to feeI.

1343
01:13:23,045 --> 01:13:26,105
All the little
untruths that...

1344
01:13:26,182 --> 01:13:27,615
Hard to catch,
but they mount up.

1345
01:13:27,683 --> 01:13:30,618
Janey, come on.
It was one mistake.

1346
01:13:30,686 --> 01:13:31,710
No, it's...

1347
01:13:31,787 --> 01:13:32,811
Everything okay out here?

1348
01:13:34,724 --> 01:13:36,351
Kids are getting hungry.
Yeah.

1349
01:13:37,293 --> 01:13:39,284
We're done.
We were just...

1350
01:13:39,361 --> 01:13:41,795
Oh, Jane, it's none
of my beeswax, so...

1351
01:13:42,665 --> 01:13:44,030
Please don't tell me.

1352
01:13:44,100 --> 01:13:45,158
What's up?

1353
01:13:45,568 --> 01:13:46,660
Nothing, punky.
Yeah?

1354
01:13:46,736 --> 01:13:48,294
So we're gonna see you
tomorrow night for sure, right?

1355
01:13:48,370 --> 01:13:49,496
Absolutely.

1356
01:13:50,873 --> 01:13:52,500
What did you see
and what do you know?

1357
01:13:52,575 --> 01:13:54,065
Nothing. Really.
Harley!

1358
01:13:54,176 --> 01:13:55,473
Okay, he checked in,
then you arrived.

1359
01:13:55,544 --> 01:13:57,205
Then you met at the elevator,
possible kiss there.

1360
01:13:57,313 --> 01:13:58,837
Then the doctor went up
and the doctor came down.

1361
01:13:58,914 --> 01:14:00,643
Then there was a thumbs-up,
but that's it.

1362
01:14:00,716 --> 01:14:02,081
I have no idea what
happened in between.

1363
01:14:02,184 --> 01:14:03,208
Have you told Lauren?

1364
01:14:03,285 --> 01:14:04,513
No, and I won't.

1365
01:14:04,587 --> 01:14:06,487
Hey, Mom. Dad's leaving.

1366
01:14:09,492 --> 01:14:10,891
Looking good.
Oh, sorry. Wow.

1367
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:12,188
Yes, it's so good.

1368
01:14:12,261 --> 01:14:14,058
Mom, it looks beautifuI.
Thank you.

1369
01:14:14,163 --> 01:14:15,221
Yes, it does.

1370
01:14:15,297 --> 01:14:16,423
Hey, Dad,
thanks for picking me up.

1371
01:14:16,499 --> 01:14:18,364
Yeah. BBye.

1372
01:14:19,735 --> 01:14:20,759
...overdone it a little?

1373
01:14:20,836 --> 01:14:21,928
Just a little bit!

1374
01:14:58,407 --> 01:14:59,431
Yeah.

1375
01:15:34,910 --> 01:15:37,444
Hey.

1376
01:15:37,947 --> 01:15:39,073
You look fantastic.

1377
01:15:39,148 --> 01:15:42,242
I'm feeling
a little fantastic.

1378
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:46,114
This is for you.

1379
01:15:46,188 --> 01:15:48,247
Really? Thank you!

1380
01:15:48,324 --> 01:15:51,452
Come on in.
Wow. That's so...

1381
01:15:52,494 --> 01:15:55,486
Mmm. Will you
hold that for a sec?

1382
01:15:57,166 --> 01:15:59,191
Oh, my God!

1383
01:16:00,669 --> 01:16:03,832
Mmm. Mmm.

1384
01:16:04,940 --> 01:16:07,966
Could be the best cake I
ever made. You want a piece?

1385
01:16:08,043 --> 01:16:09,169
It's beyond.

1386
01:16:09,245 --> 01:16:10,337
I think I'm good.

1387
01:16:10,512 --> 01:16:16,815
Okay. Can't believe you
brought me a gift. So nice!

1388
01:16:19,889 --> 01:16:20,947
An appointment book.

1389
01:16:21,023 --> 01:16:22,820
I sort of assumed
you didn't have one.

1390
01:16:23,492 --> 01:16:27,861
BBecause I never
remember our...

1391
01:16:28,230 --> 01:16:29,288
Yeah.
Yeah.

1392
01:16:29,798 --> 01:16:31,698
Oh! I took the liberty of marking

1393
01:16:31,800 --> 01:16:33,700
our next two appointments
with Post-it notes.

1394
01:16:33,769 --> 01:16:35,566
And I wrote the...
Wrote it in red.

1395
01:16:35,638 --> 01:16:36,662
Mmm-hmm.

1396
01:16:36,739 --> 01:16:38,468
And highlighted them
in neon yellow.

1397
01:16:38,540 --> 01:16:40,303
Thank you. BBecause
I thought that was a...

1398
01:16:41,510 --> 01:16:42,568
Oh.

1399
01:16:42,678 --> 01:16:44,077
I'm sorry.

1400
01:16:44,914 --> 01:16:46,074
I'm not.

1401
01:16:47,416 --> 01:16:48,849
Wow. That cake is good.

1402
01:16:52,521 --> 01:16:53,545
I get it!

1403
01:16:53,722 --> 01:16:55,383
So, let me
ask you a question.

1404
01:16:55,491 --> 01:16:57,891
Please don't think that I'm
weird or out of line or anything.

1405
01:16:57,993 --> 01:17:01,485
BBut do you by any
chance poke smot?

1406
01:17:01,563 --> 01:17:03,053
Do I... Do I what?

1407
01:17:03,165 --> 01:17:05,929
I mean, do you smoke pot?

1408
01:17:06,035 --> 01:17:07,059
Oh.

1409
01:17:07,136 --> 01:17:08,501
I haven't asked
anyone that question

1410
01:17:08,570 --> 01:17:09,730
since I was 22.

1411
01:17:09,805 --> 01:17:11,466
Mmm, no, I don't.

1412
01:17:11,540 --> 01:17:16,170
BBut I have. Uh, but I don't think
I've had any since my kids were born,

1413
01:17:16,245 --> 01:17:18,873
so not like in 27 years.

1414
01:17:18,948 --> 01:17:21,542
Oh, my God!
Our kids are the same age.

1415
01:17:21,617 --> 01:17:24,245
And I haven't had any since
my kids were born either.

1416
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:25,651
Except for tonight.

1417
01:17:25,721 --> 01:17:28,383
I had one hit from this!

1418
01:17:29,925 --> 01:17:31,950
You might not wanna
hold that up quite so...

1419
01:17:34,063 --> 01:17:38,363
I actually know him.
BBIueberry scone and a latte.

1420
01:17:38,434 --> 01:17:40,925
Oh. Hi.

1421
01:17:42,438 --> 01:17:43,462
Hi.

1422
01:17:43,706 --> 01:17:45,867
Oh, my God.
That was horrifying.

1423
01:17:45,941 --> 01:17:48,739
I instantly saw myself
in a mug shot.

1424
01:17:48,811 --> 01:17:51,439
My heart is...
leaping out of my...

1425
01:17:51,547 --> 01:17:55,483
Wow. That's the most
insane dashboard I ever saw.

1426
01:17:55,951 --> 01:18:00,183
It's like we're in a
cockpit. Spectacular!

1427
01:18:00,255 --> 01:18:02,246
Adam, what kind
of car is this?

1428
01:18:02,324 --> 01:18:03,848
Uh, Jane.

1429
01:18:03,926 --> 01:18:04,984
Hi.

1430
01:18:05,327 --> 01:18:07,625
Did you get this high
from one hit?

1431
01:18:07,730 --> 01:18:13,669
Yes! I don't know what they've
done to pot in the last 30 years,

1432
01:18:13,902 --> 01:18:16,632
but it rocks!

1433
01:18:26,949 --> 01:18:30,646
Just don't take too much,
because it's really strong.

1434
01:18:40,696 --> 01:18:43,494
I haven't had fun in
almost three years, Jane.

1435
01:18:44,500 --> 01:18:48,266
BBring it on.

1436
01:18:53,042 --> 01:18:54,373
Who's got the reefer?

1437
01:18:54,476 --> 01:18:56,376
No one. Keep walking, please.

1438
01:19:10,025 --> 01:19:11,322
How are you feeling?

1439
01:19:11,393 --> 01:19:13,293
Totally fine.
Me, too.

1440
01:19:15,998 --> 01:19:17,556
Hi!

1441
01:19:18,300 --> 01:19:21,497
Oh! I love your dress!

1442
01:19:21,570 --> 01:19:22,696
Hey, Harls.

1443
01:19:22,771 --> 01:19:23,829
Harls? Uh-oh.

1444
01:19:23,906 --> 01:19:26,204
Adam, this is my
oldest, Lauren.

1445
01:19:26,308 --> 01:19:27,366
Hi.

1446
01:19:27,443 --> 01:19:29,843
And her fiancé Harley.

1447
01:19:29,912 --> 01:19:31,140
Right.

1448
01:19:31,213 --> 01:19:32,373
We're on a date.

1449
01:19:50,833 --> 01:19:53,927
The one good thing

1450
01:19:54,036 --> 01:19:56,561
In my life

1451
01:19:56,672 --> 01:19:59,163
Has gone away

1452
01:19:59,241 --> 01:20:01,732
I don't know why

1453
01:20:02,744 --> 01:20:04,837
She's gone away

1454
01:20:04,913 --> 01:20:07,347
I don't know where

1455
01:20:08,584 --> 01:20:13,180
Somewhere I can't
follow her

1456
01:20:15,958 --> 01:20:17,289
You got to come
meet them.

1457
01:20:17,359 --> 01:20:18,451
I need to go.

1458
01:20:18,527 --> 01:20:20,518
Hey, nice to meet you.
BBye. Nice meeting you.

1459
01:20:20,629 --> 01:20:21,857
We're gonna
get some drinks.

1460
01:20:21,930 --> 01:20:23,090
It was really nice
to meet you.

1461
01:20:23,899 --> 01:20:25,230
BBye.

1462
01:20:25,300 --> 01:20:26,790
Adorable.

1463
01:20:26,902 --> 01:20:27,960
Thanks.

1464
01:20:28,036 --> 01:20:29,503
BBy the way,
how great is this party?

1465
01:20:29,571 --> 01:20:31,562
It's great! Let's be the last to leave.

1466
01:20:31,640 --> 01:20:33,574
Okay.
Oh!

1467
01:20:34,776 --> 01:20:36,243
Hey, there's
your ex-husband.

1468
01:20:36,311 --> 01:20:38,302
Uh-oh, and he's headed
right toward us.

1469
01:20:38,413 --> 01:20:39,402
Oh, what?

1470
01:20:39,481 --> 01:20:41,472
Not a great time to
be feeling groovy.

1471
01:20:46,155 --> 01:20:48,885
Ooh, why so intense,
big fella?

1472
01:20:48,957 --> 01:20:50,049
Hi.

1473
01:20:51,593 --> 01:20:53,083
Hello, Jane.
Hi.

1474
01:20:53,162 --> 01:20:54,220
Hey!

1475
01:20:54,296 --> 01:20:55,320
Adam.

1476
01:20:55,397 --> 01:20:57,592
Good to see you again.

1477
01:20:57,666 --> 01:20:59,065
Hi.

1478
01:20:59,134 --> 01:21:01,796
Adam, this is Agness,
Jake's wife.

1479
01:21:02,638 --> 01:21:04,128
Hi.
Hi.

1480
01:21:04,239 --> 01:21:07,333
Ah! That's... That's
such an odd sentence

1481
01:21:07,442 --> 01:21:11,310
for me to say since that
was me for most of my life.

1482
01:21:11,413 --> 01:21:14,041
I mean, seriously.
How weird is that?

1483
01:21:14,116 --> 01:21:15,845
BBoth of us married
to the same man!

1484
01:21:15,918 --> 01:21:17,180
Hey. What are
you gonna do?

1485
01:21:17,286 --> 01:21:19,151
Yeah. Why go there?

1486
01:21:19,254 --> 01:21:24,089
BBecause there...
it's fascinating!

1487
01:21:24,459 --> 01:21:25,721
I mean,
if you think about it,

1488
01:21:25,794 --> 01:21:28,319
it sort of links us
in a sort of cosmic,

1489
01:21:28,430 --> 01:21:32,332
crazy way.
Doesn't it, Agness?

1490
01:21:32,434 --> 01:21:34,197
I mean, of all the men
on the planet,

1491
01:21:34,269 --> 01:21:35,759
we both said
"I do" to this guy!

1492
01:21:35,837 --> 01:21:37,202
Oh, wow!

1493
01:21:37,306 --> 01:21:39,501
Yeah, 25 years apart.

1494
01:21:39,608 --> 01:21:42,600
I know you are having,
like, an aha moment,

1495
01:21:42,678 --> 01:21:45,841
but I think I'm gonna get a
refill. Adam, good meeting you.

1496
01:21:45,948 --> 01:21:46,972
Great meeting you.

1497
01:21:47,049 --> 01:21:48,107
Ah, ha-ha.

1498
01:21:50,352 --> 01:21:51,649
Thank you.

1499
01:21:51,720 --> 01:21:54,018
She has a really
scary tattoo.

1500
01:21:55,691 --> 01:21:58,660
Janey, could I talk
to you for a quick sec?

1501
01:22:00,829 --> 01:22:02,660
He always needs me
for a quick sec.

1502
01:22:04,499 --> 01:22:06,330
Uh, are you okay?

1503
01:22:06,401 --> 01:22:07,766
Oh, I'm very okay.

1504
01:22:07,836 --> 01:22:10,464
What's going on?
You're acting insane.

1505
01:22:10,539 --> 01:22:12,234
I'm stoned.

1506
01:22:12,307 --> 01:22:13,467
What?

1507
01:22:13,742 --> 01:22:15,073
You smoked that joint
I gave you?

1508
01:22:15,177 --> 01:22:18,669
Yeah. You told me to.
It was amazing.

1509
01:22:18,747 --> 01:22:20,078
Well, you weren't supposed
to smoke it with him,

1510
01:22:20,182 --> 01:22:21,740
you were supposed
to smoke it with me!

1511
01:22:21,850 --> 01:22:24,045
Ooh, somebody's jealous.

1512
01:22:24,152 --> 01:22:27,713
Well, yes, of course. Why
shouldn't I be? You're my...

1513
01:22:28,357 --> 01:22:31,588
What? What am I, Jake?

1514
01:22:32,661 --> 01:22:35,562
You're my
ex-wife, lover...

1515
01:22:35,664 --> 01:22:36,688
Hmm.

1516
01:22:36,765 --> 01:22:38,460
...oldest friend,
girlfriend.

1517
01:22:38,533 --> 01:22:42,765
Okay, you are hilarious.

1518
01:22:42,871 --> 01:22:47,604
And because of that, even though
I kind of hate youllove you,

1519
01:22:47,709 --> 01:22:51,042
I'm gonna let you
have some of this.

1520
01:22:51,113 --> 01:22:52,205
You love me?

1521
01:22:52,281 --> 01:22:54,841
I mean, I heard "hate"
had top billing, but...

1522
01:22:57,719 --> 01:23:01,587
Oh, my God. Are you smoking
weed in the guest bathroom?

1523
01:23:01,690 --> 01:23:02,850
Yes, we are.

1524
01:23:02,924 --> 01:23:05,017
And we'd appreciate it if you
would not tell anybody about this.

1525
01:23:05,093 --> 01:23:07,618
No, never.
Just add it to the list.

1526
01:23:07,963 --> 01:23:09,555
Care for a toke?
No.

1527
01:23:09,631 --> 01:23:10,928
I don't smoke marijuana.

1528
01:23:11,033 --> 01:23:12,591
Me neither.
Okay, one hit.

1529
01:23:12,701 --> 01:23:13,861
Okay.
All right.

1530
01:23:13,935 --> 01:23:15,562
Oh, my God!

1531
01:23:17,272 --> 01:23:19,365
Is that what I look like?

1532
01:23:20,208 --> 01:23:21,698
Oh, man!

1533
01:23:36,558 --> 01:23:39,459
I love this. Turn it up.

1534
01:24:05,020 --> 01:24:07,511
They must be hammered.

1535
01:24:07,589 --> 01:24:08,681
Something like that.

1536
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:21,626
Sweetest divorced couple
in the world.

1537
01:24:40,622 --> 01:24:42,681
Jake, I gotta go.

1538
01:25:24,199 --> 01:25:25,223
Wow.

1539
01:25:27,903 --> 01:25:30,269
Fun is
not overrated, is it?

1540
01:25:32,407 --> 01:25:33,499
You know what's great?

1541
01:25:33,575 --> 01:25:34,633
What?

1542
01:25:36,244 --> 01:25:38,644
How much I like you.

1543
01:25:39,414 --> 01:25:40,438
Thank you.

1544
01:25:43,285 --> 01:25:45,549
I really like you
a lot, too.

1545
01:25:47,055 --> 01:25:51,321
Even though...
Oh, you didn't say "a lot. "

1546
01:25:51,426 --> 01:25:53,155
I was thinking it.

1547
01:25:56,264 --> 01:25:59,756
So, I'm not
too old for you?

1548
01:26:01,670 --> 01:26:04,070
How can you be too old for
me when I'm older than you?

1549
01:26:04,139 --> 01:26:05,800
I just figured
that all the women

1550
01:26:05,874 --> 01:26:08,399
you're fixed up
with are 35 or...

1551
01:26:08,477 --> 01:26:13,005
Jane, your age is one of my
favorite things about you.

1552
01:26:17,018 --> 01:26:18,110
And...

1553
01:26:19,988 --> 01:26:21,148
do you think...

1554
01:26:22,324 --> 01:26:24,121
Do you think you have any
more of that chocolate cake

1555
01:26:24,192 --> 01:26:26,160
at your house?

1556
01:26:26,261 --> 01:26:27,956
Hungry?
Starved.

1557
01:26:38,306 --> 01:26:39,330
Oh, God.

1558
01:26:41,543 --> 01:26:47,448
Oh. Officially now the best date
of my life, pre- or post-divorce.

1559
01:26:47,516 --> 01:26:49,177
Get out.

1560
01:26:49,851 --> 01:26:54,151
Okay. So, basically, I can
make you anything on the menu.

1561
01:26:54,222 --> 01:26:55,280
No!

1562
01:26:55,357 --> 01:26:56,949
Or even not on the menu.

1563
01:26:57,025 --> 01:26:58,049
Really?

1564
01:26:58,126 --> 01:26:59,457
Mmm-hmm. Just name it.

1565
01:26:59,528 --> 01:27:01,553
Okay. Wow.

1566
01:27:02,631 --> 01:27:07,728
Uh... Oh, what about a warm
chocolate croissant?

1567
01:27:07,836 --> 01:27:09,827
Oh, it's my specialty.

1568
01:27:14,709 --> 01:27:15,835
Okay.

1569
01:28:17,706 --> 01:28:18,866
Here it goes.

1570
01:28:18,940 --> 01:28:20,066
Oh, my God!

1571
01:28:27,382 --> 01:28:29,577
Oh, baby.

1572
01:28:31,753 --> 01:28:33,277
Hmm.

1573
01:28:33,388 --> 01:28:35,788
It's crazy
how good this is.

1574
01:28:36,157 --> 01:28:38,284
And I'm not even
stoned anymore.

1575
01:28:38,893 --> 01:28:40,383
Neither am I.

1576
01:28:40,729 --> 01:28:42,663
Well, then,
merci, monsieur.

1577
01:28:46,401 --> 01:28:48,892
Do you remember when I
asked you the other night

1578
01:28:48,970 --> 01:28:51,962
if you were dating anyone,
and you said no.

1579
01:28:52,607 --> 01:28:55,940
BBut it felt to me like
you were maybe saying yes.

1580
01:28:57,946 --> 01:29:01,245
I was sort of
seeing someone.

1581
01:29:02,350 --> 01:29:04,147
BBut it's over now.

1582
01:29:06,321 --> 01:29:07,686
Honestly.

1583
01:29:08,957 --> 01:29:13,121
BBecause I don't wanna fall for
someone who's seeing someone else.

1584
01:29:13,461 --> 01:29:16,191
I wouldn't be able
to take that again.

1585
01:29:16,998 --> 01:29:18,488
I understand.

1586
01:29:21,002 --> 01:29:24,938
I wouldn't say it was over
unless... Unless it was.

1587
01:29:25,840 --> 01:29:27,034
Great.

1588
01:29:32,781 --> 01:29:34,806
Oh, it's a cooking scar.

1589
01:29:35,517 --> 01:29:38,042
BBig batch
of hot carameI.

1590
01:29:38,153 --> 01:29:39,984
And what about this one?

1591
01:29:40,055 --> 01:29:43,456
Oh, that was boiling sugar.

1592
01:29:44,025 --> 01:29:47,119
Yeah, I wasn't very
skilled in the beginning.

1593
01:29:52,400 --> 01:29:57,167
That is a...
From a large French

1594
01:30:01,843 --> 01:30:03,242
sauté pan.

1595
01:30:04,579 --> 01:30:05,773
Would it be
all right if I...

1596
01:30:05,847 --> 01:30:06,973
Mmm-hmm.

1597
01:30:11,586 --> 01:30:13,577
I was going
to say "kiss you. "

1598
01:30:13,688 --> 01:30:15,087
I figured.

1599
01:30:15,990 --> 01:30:19,391
And if you feeI this is in any
way wrong because we're working...

1600
01:30:19,494 --> 01:30:20,756
I don't.

1601
01:30:28,636 --> 01:30:29,625
I don't.

1602
01:30:45,687 --> 01:30:47,780
Hey, sleepy.

1603
01:30:48,089 --> 01:30:49,113
Hi.

1604
01:30:49,190 --> 01:30:50,521
What time did you get in?

1605
01:30:50,592 --> 01:30:53,755
I have no idea. Lauren
and Harley drove me home.

1606
01:30:53,862 --> 01:30:55,591
I'm surprised
you remember that.

1607
01:30:55,697 --> 01:30:58,359
Hi! I didn't know
you slept over.

1608
01:30:58,433 --> 01:31:00,025
We were playing
Scattergories with Gabby,

1609
01:31:00,101 --> 01:31:01,625
and Harley fell asleep
on the couch.

1610
01:31:01,736 --> 01:31:03,567
Oh, sweet!

1611
01:31:05,206 --> 01:31:06,901
I got cold in the middle
of the night.

1612
01:31:06,975 --> 01:31:08,602
Wow.

1613
01:31:10,879 --> 01:31:13,871
Okay, who's hungry?
Who wants what?

1614
01:31:14,816 --> 01:31:15,840
Hey, baby.

1615
01:31:15,917 --> 01:31:18,579
Hi. What is Dad doing here?

1616
01:31:35,170 --> 01:31:36,899
Everything okay?

1617
01:31:38,106 --> 01:31:39,573
I left Agness.

1618
01:31:39,641 --> 01:31:42,303
No. Don't say that.

1619
01:31:42,410 --> 01:31:43,502
Janey, she saw it
in my eyes.

1620
01:31:43,578 --> 01:31:44,670
Saw what?

1621
01:31:44,779 --> 01:31:46,644
That I'm still
in love with you.

1622
01:31:46,714 --> 01:31:50,445
I admitted it, told her all
about us, and I've left her.

1623
01:31:50,618 --> 01:31:51,642
For you.

1624
01:31:51,719 --> 01:31:52,708
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1625
01:31:52,787 --> 01:31:55,449
What do you mean?
This is crazy, Jake!

1626
01:31:55,523 --> 01:31:57,684
Are you telling me
the truth?

1627
01:31:57,759 --> 01:31:59,317
This feels so right, Jane.

1628
01:32:00,128 --> 01:32:01,823
What's going on?

1629
01:32:03,331 --> 01:32:04,821
Go set the table.
I'll be right in.

1630
01:32:04,899 --> 01:32:07,800
Uh, Mom, nobody cares if the
table's set except for you.

1631
01:32:07,869 --> 01:32:10,429
Okay, then do it for me.
Just go in. Please?

1632
01:32:10,505 --> 01:32:11,597
What's up, Dad?

1633
01:32:11,673 --> 01:32:13,504
Uh, just having some
problems on the home front.

1634
01:32:13,575 --> 01:32:16,373
I wanted to talk to
your mom for a sec.

1635
01:32:16,511 --> 01:32:18,911
Uh, problems on
the home front?

1636
01:32:21,916 --> 01:32:23,713
Is one of you
seeing someone else?

1637
01:32:23,785 --> 01:32:25,810
Oh, no. No.

1638
01:32:25,887 --> 01:32:29,653
Nothing like that. I just,
uh, need a hoteI or something

1639
01:32:29,724 --> 01:32:32,818
for a few days, till
I get my head together.

1640
01:32:32,894 --> 01:32:34,691
It's that serious?

1641
01:32:35,096 --> 01:32:36,188
Mom, can Dad stay here
for a few days?

1642
01:32:36,264 --> 01:32:37,288
No.

1643
01:32:37,365 --> 01:32:38,696
He can share my room.

1644
01:32:38,766 --> 01:32:42,202
You know, I don't think
that's the best idea, Luke.

1645
01:32:42,837 --> 01:32:45,897
Daddy. Are you crying?

1646
01:32:50,011 --> 01:32:51,911
I'm sorry.

1647
01:32:57,785 --> 01:32:58,911
Mom!

1648
01:33:11,599 --> 01:33:15,228
Mommy is the best cook
in the world.

1649
01:33:27,148 --> 01:33:29,275
Think about
what he's doing.

1650
01:33:29,384 --> 01:33:32,547
He's nuts. Mmm.

1651
01:33:35,123 --> 01:33:36,750
Thank you for
saving me, Janey.

1652
01:33:36,824 --> 01:33:38,416
Jake.

1653
01:33:38,760 --> 01:33:40,193
You knew all
the kids were here.

1654
01:33:40,261 --> 01:33:41,660
Shouldn't we have
talked about this?

1655
01:33:41,763 --> 01:33:43,230
Agreed that it was
the right thing to do?

1656
01:33:43,298 --> 01:33:44,356
I'm sorry.

1657
01:33:44,432 --> 01:33:46,229
No, no.
This is just so typicaI.

1658
01:33:46,301 --> 01:33:48,235
Only thinking about
what works for you.

1659
01:33:48,303 --> 01:33:50,601
I guess I should have
called before showing up.

1660
01:33:50,672 --> 01:33:53,766
And I'm not sure
you left Agness.

1661
01:33:53,841 --> 01:33:57,333
Maybe she saw something
and threw you out.

1662
01:33:58,346 --> 01:34:01,076
What's the difference?
I was drowning over there.

1663
01:34:01,149 --> 01:34:03,310
I'm not gonna get
that many more chances

1664
01:34:03,418 --> 01:34:05,409
to figure myself out.
Yeah.

1665
01:34:05,486 --> 01:34:07,920
Janey, let's use
these couple of days

1666
01:34:07,989 --> 01:34:09,183
to see if we can
make this work!

1667
01:34:09,257 --> 01:34:10,417
No. We can't, Jake.

1668
01:34:10,491 --> 01:34:12,322
I told you this the other night. BBut...

1669
01:34:12,427 --> 01:34:13,621
No, you...
Please listen to me. You...

1670
01:34:13,695 --> 01:34:16,163
You were pissy because
you thought I stood you up.

1671
01:34:16,264 --> 01:34:18,755
Things are different now.
I'm a free man!

1672
01:34:21,436 --> 01:34:23,131
Can we just hug?

1673
01:34:23,871 --> 01:34:25,736
I hate that you're
being so distant.

1674
01:34:25,807 --> 01:34:29,140
It's literally giving me
a pain in my stomach.

1675
01:34:29,210 --> 01:34:31,838
Oh, God. Come here.

1676
01:34:35,516 --> 01:34:37,950
You okay?
No. See? Too much.

1677
01:34:38,019 --> 01:34:39,680
Okay. Good note.

1678
01:34:41,522 --> 01:34:44,980
Uh, can I help you with
what you're doing?

1679
01:34:45,059 --> 01:34:47,527
Maybe hold your basket?

1680
01:34:48,730 --> 01:34:50,027
I'm fine.

1681
01:34:50,131 --> 01:34:51,496
Okay, I'm going to
go to the video store

1682
01:34:51,566 --> 01:34:53,090
and get us a DVD
we can watch tonight.

1683
01:34:53,167 --> 01:34:54,725
Mmm-hmm. We'll have movie
night, like old times.

1684
01:34:54,836 --> 01:34:57,669
How's that? I'll make
the popcorn. Oh, God!

1685
01:34:57,739 --> 01:34:58,899
Fine.

1686
01:35:01,142 --> 01:35:02,131
Hello?

1687
01:35:02,210 --> 01:35:04,508
I love knowing that
I'm coming back here.

1688
01:35:06,147 --> 01:35:09,514
Hi! Oh.

1689
01:35:10,018 --> 01:35:13,044
Yeah, I slept great.
How about you?

1690
01:35:15,556 --> 01:35:18,855
Um. Oh!

1691
01:35:21,029 --> 01:35:23,554
I know. It was.

1692
01:35:23,931 --> 01:35:25,899
It was, I know.

1693
01:35:36,477 --> 01:35:38,035
Thanks, Daddy.

1694
01:35:41,516 --> 01:35:42,983
Can I help you, sir?

1695
01:35:43,051 --> 01:35:45,815
What?
Oh, no. I'm just...

1696
01:35:46,087 --> 01:35:47,577
Are you here
for an affair, sir?

1697
01:35:49,057 --> 01:35:50,217
What?

1698
01:35:50,291 --> 01:35:51,383
The Singleman party, sir?

1699
01:35:51,492 --> 01:35:53,858
Oh, yes.
The Singleman party.

1700
01:35:54,228 --> 01:35:55,422
It's in
the main ballroom.

1701
01:35:55,496 --> 01:35:57,430
Ah, thank you.

1702
01:35:57,498 --> 01:35:59,557
I'm so happy.

1703
01:36:04,105 --> 01:36:05,367
I never have food
in my apartment.

1704
01:36:05,440 --> 01:36:07,340
I know.
I don't either.

1705
01:36:07,408 --> 01:36:08,534
Oh,
get the mashed potato.

1706
01:36:08,609 --> 01:36:09,667
Yum!

1707
01:36:09,744 --> 01:36:10,802
Why are we still hungry?

1708
01:36:10,878 --> 01:36:11,902
I don't know.

1709
01:36:12,013 --> 01:36:13,537
It's...
Oh!

1710
01:36:13,614 --> 01:36:14,638
Any leftovers?

1711
01:36:14,715 --> 01:36:15,704
Uh, are you kidding?

1712
01:36:15,783 --> 01:36:18,183
Any of that
noodle thing left?

1713
01:36:19,587 --> 01:36:23,546
Oh! Where's your mom? She
disappeared so fast after the movie.

1714
01:36:23,624 --> 01:36:25,182
She's probably sleeping.

1715
01:36:25,259 --> 01:36:27,625
I think she's
on her computer.

1716
01:36:28,596 --> 01:36:30,496
Tonight was weird.

1717
01:36:30,565 --> 01:36:32,396
So weird. Still is.

1718
01:36:32,934 --> 01:36:33,992
I loved tonight.

1719
01:36:34,068 --> 01:36:35,797
Yeah. That's why
it's so weird.

1720
01:36:35,870 --> 01:36:38,395
Just to see you in
your robe in our kitchen.

1721
01:36:38,473 --> 01:36:39,872
Remember when you
weren't even allowed in?

1722
01:36:39,941 --> 01:36:42,102
Mom used to go out to
the car to talk to you.

1723
01:36:42,210 --> 01:36:46,306
You know, I don't even really
remember you and Mom as a couple.

1724
01:36:46,747 --> 01:36:49,716
What do you mean? You
were 10 when we broke up.

1725
01:36:49,784 --> 01:36:51,615
I was 12, actually.

1726
01:36:51,719 --> 01:36:55,382
And I don't know, it's just...
It's all foggy to me now.

1727
01:36:55,456 --> 01:36:57,424
You don't
remember us in Hawaii

1728
01:36:57,492 --> 01:36:59,790
or all of us sleeping together
in that tent in the backyard?

1729
01:36:59,894 --> 01:37:03,125
Yeah, of course. I just...
I don't remember, like,

1730
01:37:03,598 --> 01:37:07,557
you and Mom hugging
or waking up together.

1731
01:37:08,769 --> 01:37:09,895
Luke.

1732
01:37:09,971 --> 01:37:11,836
It's okay.
I'm not damaged or anything.

1733
01:37:11,939 --> 01:37:16,273
Dude, speak for yourself. I am
definitely damaged from this divorce.

1734
01:37:16,511 --> 01:37:17,808
Hello, troops.

1735
01:37:17,879 --> 01:37:19,141
Why are you still here?

1736
01:37:19,247 --> 01:37:22,739
I don't know. You and Mom
sleeping in the same house?

1737
01:37:23,284 --> 01:37:25,616
Harley thought
we should stay.

1738
01:37:26,320 --> 01:37:28,151
She exaggerates.
I just thought, perhaps,

1739
01:37:28,222 --> 01:37:29,985
you might want
to talk later or...

1740
01:37:30,091 --> 01:37:31,683
Is that the noodle thing?

1741
01:37:34,128 --> 01:37:36,722
Oh, I'm sorry.
I think I ate it all.

1742
01:37:36,797 --> 01:37:37,923
Dad!

1743
01:37:37,999 --> 01:37:39,330
I didn't know
anyone wanted it.

1744
01:37:40,935 --> 01:37:44,166
BBack up. BBack up. A little
bit back, so I can see. Oh!

1745
01:37:45,439 --> 01:37:46,497
Very festive.

1746
01:37:46,574 --> 01:37:47,836
Okay, thanks.

1747
01:37:48,176 --> 01:37:49,837
It was gift from
my ex-sister-in-law.

1748
01:37:49,911 --> 01:37:52,880
I have no idea why I
kept it. Into the pile.

1749
01:37:52,947 --> 01:37:55,006
Hey, Jane,
take a look at the pile.

1750
01:37:55,116 --> 01:37:57,346
Yeah. Nice!

1751
01:37:57,451 --> 01:37:59,316
Ah! The pile's moving.

1752
01:37:59,387 --> 01:38:00,877
Murphy, get out of there.

1753
01:38:03,124 --> 01:38:05,092
When I was in India
I had this made,

1754
01:38:05,159 --> 01:38:06,217
but the guy ran
out of fabric,

1755
01:38:06,694 --> 01:38:09,629
so he didn't give me long
sleeves, or short sleeves.

1756
01:38:09,697 --> 01:38:11,028
It's weird.

1757
01:38:11,098 --> 01:38:12,360
Uh, and kind of girly.

1758
01:38:12,700 --> 01:38:14,031
Not what I should
be going for.

1759
01:38:15,002 --> 01:38:17,562
How about this?
Gray sweater, very old.

1760
01:38:17,672 --> 01:38:19,299
Oh. BBut cute.

1761
01:38:19,373 --> 01:38:20,738
You're sure? Now you
don't have to say that

1762
01:38:20,841 --> 01:38:22,502
just because you nixed
the last 20 things.

1763
01:38:22,577 --> 01:38:24,807
No. You have to
keep that. It's cozy.

1764
01:38:24,879 --> 01:38:26,676
You are helping me
so much, by the way.

1765
01:38:26,747 --> 01:38:28,476
Okay, Adam, I feeI like...
I gotta pee.

1766
01:38:28,549 --> 01:38:31,746
Oh, good. Me, too.
I'll meet you back in 30.

1767
01:38:31,852 --> 01:38:33,444
I'm putting you on the desk.

1768
01:38:33,521 --> 01:38:35,113
I'm not in there.

1769
01:38:35,289 --> 01:38:36,881
Can't hear you!

1770
01:39:27,008 --> 01:39:28,305
No! Mother of... Whoa!

1771
01:39:28,376 --> 01:39:29,434
What?

1772
01:39:29,510 --> 01:39:31,273
What are you doing in
here? I wanted to see you.

1773
01:39:31,379 --> 01:39:33,074
Get it off!
Why are you naked?

1774
01:39:33,180 --> 01:39:34,169
Why do you think?

1775
01:39:34,248 --> 01:39:35,306
Oh! I'm gonna be sick!

1776
01:39:35,383 --> 01:39:38,216
Not working! BBig close-up!

1777
01:39:39,887 --> 01:39:41,718
Oh, the other side.

1778
01:39:41,922 --> 01:39:42,946
No, no, no! No!

1779
01:39:43,024 --> 01:39:45,288
No! Okay!

1780
01:39:56,804 --> 01:39:59,671
Mom! Everybody okay?

1781
01:40:01,642 --> 01:40:03,405
What's happening?

1782
01:40:03,811 --> 01:40:06,905
Okay. Just let me explain.

1783
01:40:08,416 --> 01:40:10,907
The reason that I left
Agness was not just because

1784
01:40:10,985 --> 01:40:13,351
my marriage
wasn't working.

1785
01:40:13,688 --> 01:40:17,146
I've also fallen in love...

1786
01:40:17,825 --> 01:40:21,852
BBack in love
with your mother.

1787
01:40:24,465 --> 01:40:27,434
Maybe, I never
stopped loving her.

1788
01:40:29,136 --> 01:40:30,763
Is this a joke?

1789
01:40:31,872 --> 01:40:34,033
I know it's shocking,

1790
01:40:34,141 --> 01:40:37,542
but I think this is the best
thing that's ever happened to me.

1791
01:40:37,645 --> 01:40:40,978
Your mother and I have been seeing
each other ever since New York.

1792
01:40:41,048 --> 01:40:43,278
Mom,
is this true?

1793
01:40:43,851 --> 01:40:46,149
That part is, but...

1794
01:40:46,220 --> 01:40:48,120
I found my way home.

1795
01:40:49,824 --> 01:40:51,985
I hope she'll take me back.

1796
01:40:58,999 --> 01:41:03,333
Why is everyone crying?
Why isn't this good news?

1797
01:41:04,638 --> 01:41:07,630
BBecause we're still
getting over the divorce.

1798
01:41:07,708 --> 01:41:09,676
Oh!
Mom,

1799
01:41:09,744 --> 01:41:12,542
are you and Dad
getting back together?

1800
01:41:16,751 --> 01:41:17,979
No.

1801
01:41:20,588 --> 01:41:22,021
We're not.

1802
01:42:04,398 --> 01:42:05,763
Lauren...

1803
01:43:20,307 --> 01:43:22,468
No! What...

1804
01:43:46,734 --> 01:43:48,292
Glad you're here, boss.

1805
01:43:53,807 --> 01:43:56,537
Now, Jane, I know you
don't need my advice, but...

1806
01:43:56,644 --> 01:43:59,010
I got this one.

1807
01:43:59,079 --> 01:44:01,411
Yeah. Yeah,
I know you do.

1808
01:44:23,671 --> 01:44:28,108
Knowing how to be divorced
is next to impossible.

1809
01:44:29,577 --> 01:44:32,045
And sometimes,
over the years,

1810
01:44:32,112 --> 01:44:36,378
I have thought that your dad
and I weren't quite finished.

1811
01:44:37,885 --> 01:44:40,854
And as it
turns out, we weren't.

1812
01:44:42,189 --> 01:44:44,350
So, I went out of
my comfort zone,

1813
01:44:44,425 --> 01:44:47,394
which I found out if you're
really honest with yourself,

1814
01:44:47,461 --> 01:44:49,691
isn't all that comforting.

1815
01:44:50,097 --> 01:44:52,759
And I experimented
with a part of myself

1816
01:44:52,866 --> 01:44:55,528
because I wanted to know
if after all these years

1817
01:44:55,603 --> 01:44:59,562
there was still something
there between us.

1818
01:45:00,207 --> 01:45:01,765
And was there?

1819
01:45:02,276 --> 01:45:04,437
Mmm,
there kind of was. Yeah.

1820
01:45:05,079 --> 01:45:07,343
BBut, Mom,
you have to understand

1821
01:45:07,414 --> 01:45:09,644
how bonkers
this sounds to us.

1822
01:45:09,750 --> 01:45:10,739
Mmm.

1823
01:45:10,818 --> 01:45:12,217
For two people,

1824
01:45:12,286 --> 01:45:15,744
who for years couldn't be
in the same room together,

1825
01:45:15,823 --> 01:45:17,814
to then have an affair.

1826
01:45:17,925 --> 01:45:21,088
I know. It was hard
for me and I was doing it.

1827
01:45:21,829 --> 01:45:26,892
I hope you'll forgive me
for confusing you.

1828
01:45:28,669 --> 01:45:30,796
And betraying your trust.

1829
01:45:32,072 --> 01:45:34,506
BBut, I did this for me.

1830
01:45:35,342 --> 01:45:37,276
And I did it for him.

1831
01:45:37,678 --> 01:45:40,306
And I realize that even
though your dad and I

1832
01:45:40,381 --> 01:45:43,817
once had
something extraordinary,

1833
01:45:44,852 --> 01:45:49,585
now we no longer really

1834
01:45:51,325 --> 01:45:52,849
fit together.

1835
01:45:56,196 --> 01:45:59,597
BBut he is a part of me.
He always will be.

1836
01:46:00,034 --> 01:46:04,130
So, it's over now? You guys
are back to being divorced?

1837
01:46:05,506 --> 01:46:06,837
Mmm-hmm.

1838
01:46:10,077 --> 01:46:12,136
For better or for worse.

1839
01:46:17,518 --> 01:46:18,917
Come here.

1840
01:46:20,087 --> 01:46:21,452
My littles...

1841
01:46:21,522 --> 01:46:23,353
Okay, I'm coming in.

1842
01:46:25,292 --> 01:46:26,623
Oh!

1843
01:46:34,101 --> 01:46:36,092
So, did you
get the elevations?

1844
01:46:36,170 --> 01:46:38,104
Yup,
we like them, too.

1845
01:46:38,706 --> 01:46:42,540
Uh-huh. Yeah. No, we
can definitely do that.

1846
01:46:42,609 --> 01:46:45,806
And I can have more
for you by mid week.

1847
01:46:48,916 --> 01:46:52,249
Sean, uh, can I call you
right back? Someone just...

1848
01:46:52,319 --> 01:46:53,843
Thanks.

1849
01:46:56,290 --> 01:46:57,621
Hi.
Hi.

1850
01:46:58,792 --> 01:46:59,816
May I come in?

1851
01:46:59,893 --> 01:47:00,882
Uh, sure.

1852
01:47:10,337 --> 01:47:13,568
I didn't call you last night because
I wasn't sure you'd take the call.

1853
01:47:15,008 --> 01:47:16,703
And then I thought that
could go on for months.

1854
01:47:16,810 --> 01:47:18,903
I would've taken the call.

1855
01:47:19,079 --> 01:47:22,242
Oh! Okay. Well...

1856
01:47:23,584 --> 01:47:26,348
Anyway, it's better to say
these things in person, Adam.

1857
01:47:26,420 --> 01:47:28,251
The man that
I was seeing...

1858
01:47:28,355 --> 01:47:31,051
I think I'm up to
speed on that part.

1859
01:47:32,426 --> 01:47:35,987
Yeah. Anyway, I want you
to know it didn't last long.

1860
01:47:36,864 --> 01:47:38,593
You're divorced. I mean,

1861
01:47:38,699 --> 01:47:40,997
maybe you can understand
when a marriage ends

1862
01:47:41,068 --> 01:47:45,004
there's doubts and hurt and
when you have kids, you just...

1863
01:47:45,072 --> 01:47:47,540
Sometimes you wonder
if you did the right thing,

1864
01:47:47,608 --> 01:47:50,008
and the moment
presents itself and...

1865
01:47:50,077 --> 01:47:53,342
I get it. I could
imagine it. I could.

1866
01:47:54,782 --> 01:47:58,115
And I told him that it wasn't
going to work out between us,

1867
01:47:58,218 --> 01:48:02,052
but I guess he didn't
hear me or believe me.

1868
01:48:03,857 --> 01:48:06,621
And, uh, unbeknownst to me, he
showed up at my house yesterday

1869
01:48:06,727 --> 01:48:08,251
and he has left Agness.

1870
01:48:08,362 --> 01:48:11,695
Jane, I actually think I
understand what happened.

1871
01:48:13,233 --> 01:48:17,363
BBut, you know, um, I'm
not as macho as I appear.

1872
01:48:17,738 --> 01:48:21,697
And I think it's
probably best for us

1873
01:48:21,775 --> 01:48:23,743
if we don't get
any more involved.

1874
01:48:24,745 --> 01:48:29,773
BBecause your relationship
with Jake isn't really done.

1875
01:48:30,317 --> 01:48:31,841
And I know
you're saying it is,

1876
01:48:31,919 --> 01:48:34,717
but he's still
in love with you.

1877
01:48:35,989 --> 01:48:40,323
And for everyone's sake, I think
that should probably get resolved.

1878
01:48:43,897 --> 01:48:47,424
Wow. So that's how
grownups talk.

1879
01:48:50,771 --> 01:48:53,171
Please don't tell me that
you're going to quit my job

1880
01:48:53,273 --> 01:48:55,673
and ask Peter
to take over now.

1881
01:48:55,843 --> 01:48:58,835
'Cause then I'll never
get to see you. And...

1882
01:48:58,946 --> 01:49:02,905
Um... I was thinking of
asking Peter to step back in.

1883
01:49:06,854 --> 01:49:08,617
I hope you don't.

1884
01:49:10,023 --> 01:49:11,320
Thanks.

1885
01:50:12,486 --> 01:50:13,885
I'm sorry.

1886
01:50:18,992 --> 01:50:21,426
How far back
does that sorry go?

1887
01:50:21,862 --> 01:50:23,853
How far back do
you need it to go?

1888
01:50:23,931 --> 01:50:25,398
Way back.

1889
01:50:26,900 --> 01:50:29,664
Consider it an
all-inclusive apology.

1890
01:50:30,337 --> 01:50:35,365
From not being
the husband you needed

1891
01:50:36,576 --> 01:50:39,374
to showing up nude on
your bed last night.

1892
01:50:39,446 --> 01:50:40,674
Yeah.

1893
01:50:42,616 --> 01:50:46,382
What were you
thinking with that move?

1894
01:50:47,287 --> 01:50:49,619
That you would
find me irresistible.

1895
01:50:49,723 --> 01:50:50,747
Mmm-hmm.

1896
01:50:50,824 --> 01:50:53,122
I never considered
the alternative.

1897
01:50:53,226 --> 01:50:55,421
Got to love that
about you.

1898
01:50:56,229 --> 01:50:57,526
Oh, man.

1899
01:50:59,066 --> 01:51:03,435
I can't believe I got up
to bat again and blew it.

1900
01:51:03,804 --> 01:51:05,635
You didn't blow it.

1901
01:51:07,574 --> 01:51:09,041
We blew it.

1902
01:51:10,210 --> 01:51:12,735
We blew it
the first time around.

1903
01:51:13,480 --> 01:51:16,449
This time we just
should've known better.

1904
01:51:17,751 --> 01:51:22,120
Too much time has passed.
Too much has happened.

1905
01:51:24,091 --> 01:51:27,083
And you don't think
we could make it right?

1906
01:51:28,929 --> 01:51:32,592
Does that mean you thought
it didn't feeI right either?

1907
01:51:33,166 --> 01:51:36,795
BBeing with you, Jane,
is the best I'm going to be.

1908
01:51:37,170 --> 01:51:39,604
BBut do you agree it...

1909
01:51:40,574 --> 01:51:41,598
It wasn't really...

1910
01:51:41,675 --> 01:51:43,472
It was complicated.

1911
01:51:44,511 --> 01:51:45,842
BBegging for an answer.

1912
01:51:45,946 --> 01:51:47,914
I thought it was good.

1913
01:51:48,749 --> 01:51:50,740
I wanted it to be good.

1914
01:51:51,952 --> 01:51:54,682
Well, it's as close as
I'm going to get, I guess.

1915
01:51:54,788 --> 01:51:57,450
Do you always have to be so hard on me?

1916
01:52:01,595 --> 01:52:05,361
No, I don't.

1917
01:52:12,439 --> 01:52:15,203
I don't regret
giving it another shot.

1918
01:52:17,611 --> 01:52:20,205
Probably would've been better
if you hadn't been married.

1919
01:52:21,982 --> 01:52:24,815
It may never have happened
if I wasn't married.

1920
01:52:29,022 --> 01:52:30,353
Yeah.

1921
01:52:42,903 --> 01:52:45,030
I don't regret it either.

1922
01:53:44,197 --> 01:53:46,623
Good morning.

1923
01:53:47,801 --> 01:53:51,237
Did you know it's good luck
to start building in the rain?

1924
01:53:51,304 --> 01:53:52,430
Really?
Oh, yeah.

1925
01:53:52,539 --> 01:53:55,770
It's a well-known, very
good, really lucky omen.

1926
01:53:58,478 --> 01:54:00,969
Good. I can use one.

1927
01:54:03,884 --> 01:54:06,444
Would you all like to have
your meeting inside?

1928
01:54:06,553 --> 01:54:08,919
It's dry and I have
hot coffee.

1929
01:54:16,596 --> 01:54:19,997
Jane, I need
to ask you something.

1930
01:54:23,937 --> 01:54:25,598
You don't happen
to have any of those

1931
01:54:25,672 --> 01:54:28,197
amazing chocolate croissants,
do you?

1932
01:54:28,275 --> 01:54:30,766
Oh,
you like those, huh?

1933
01:54:30,844 --> 01:54:33,142
I do have incredibly
fond memories of them.

1934
01:54:33,213 --> 01:54:35,773
Oh, well,
I don't have any here,

1935
01:54:35,849 --> 01:54:37,908
but we could go
into town and get some,

1936
01:54:37,984 --> 01:54:39,645
right out of the oven.

1937
01:54:39,719 --> 01:54:40,777
Do you want
to do that?

1938
01:54:40,854 --> 01:54:41,946
Okay.
