1
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,700
Pinewood marriage chest
with groove joinery

2
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:55,600
and hand-forged hinges
in the shape of tulip buds.

3
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,300
Walnut sideboard.

4
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,800
16th-century French decorations

5
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:04,900
of herms and griffin-shaped cartouches.

6
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:08,200
Embellished deplorably in the 19th century.

7
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,100
A pair of oak veneer cabinets
in the Flemish style.

8
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:15,900
Upper section with two doors,

9
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:19,400
featuring carved anthropomorphic
figures and caryatids.

10
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,900
Something wrong, Mr. Oldman?

11
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,850
Is it something important?

12
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:53,050
If you were kind enough
to let me have this as a gift,

13
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,800
I'd be delighted to accept.

14
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,800
I don't remember that object.

15
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,200
It may look like a useless
piece of mouldy wood,

16
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,700
but centuries ago, beneath the mould,

17
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,300
there must have been a painting.

18
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:58,800
- Good evening, Mr. Oldman. How are you?
- Very well.

19
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,800
The management and staff of Steirereck

20
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,400
would like to offer our very best wishes,
Mr. Oldman.

21
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,500
Happy birthday, Mr. Oldman.

22
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:15,100
This year, our chefs wish
to dedicate in your honour

23
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,800
an ancient recipe of a
Renaissance dessert

24
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:20,450
made of choux cream and bitter almonds.

25
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,100
Enjoy.

26
00:04:31,706 --> 00:04:35,119
<i>- Most likely a rash or something.
- lt must be that.</i>

27
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,800
Was it not to your taste, Mr. Oldman?

28
00:04:55,413 --> 00:04:59,027
Quite the contrary, but you see,
my birthday is tomorrow.

29
00:04:59,204 --> 00:05:03,300
It is now 10:35 p.m.
and I'm very superstitious.

30
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,203
Pretend I had accepted.

31
00:05:08,663 --> 00:05:10,452
The day after tomorrow, then.

32
00:05:13,204 --> 00:05:16,570
The director of the Vatican Museums
would be grateful if you could call him back.

33
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,900
The reliquary attributed to Cellini, I presume.

34
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:21,363
In any case, the report on this is ready.

35
00:05:21,538 --> 00:05:23,800
There's a pile of gifts.
What shall I do with them?

36
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,600
Send them all to my house
except the mobile phone.

37
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,600
- Only one this year.
- Good.

38
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,500
Word's out that I hate those things.

39
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,200
Unless you've changed the habits of a lifetime,
you'll have to answer that yourself, Virgil.

40
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,500
It's the first call on your birthday.

41
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,000
Tradition.

42
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,500
Hello.

43
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,198
<i>Please, believe me.
I have no wish to waste your time.</i>

44
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,000
- Who's speaking?
- <i>It's me again, Claire Ibbetson.</i>

45
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,825
<i>Please, please don't hang up on me again.</i>

46
00:05:50,995 --> 00:05:53,600
<i>You're Mr. Oldman's secretary, aren't you?</i>

47
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:56,500
You can speak to me.
It makes no difference.

48
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:59,949
<i>You see, I don't know anybody.
I'm on my own.</i>

49
00:06:00,119 --> 00:06:02,821
I'm sorry, Miss lbbetson,
but this is not a charity helpline.

50
00:06:02,994 --> 00:06:05,000
<i>I'm not explaining myself very well.</i>

51
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,750
<i>You see, I'm not in the habit
of speaking to people very much.</i>

52
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:10,000
Believe me, that's a considerable
stroke of good fortune.

53
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,100
Talking to people is extremely perilous.

53
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,950
- <i>Well, I'm desperate--</i>
- However, it was you who made the call,

54
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,700
so you're running the risk.

55
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,500
<i>It's about furniture that belong
to my parents' villa.</i>

56
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:22,000
<i>They... about a year ago.</i>

57
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,322
- <i>You see?</i>
- I understand.

58
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,700
<i>An estate of great...</i>

59
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:28,600
<i>Well, I've always heard it
referred to as being of...</i>

60
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,157
<i>Extremely valuable.</i>

61
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,992
<i>Very rare pieces, including paintings.</i>

62
00:06:33,325 --> 00:06:35,700
<i>Unfortunately, I have no photographs.</i>

63
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,100
So what?

64
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:40,897
<i>To be honest, I haven't decided yet,
but I would like to have a...</i>

65
00:06:41,074 --> 00:06:43,444
<i>Oh, I'm out of my depth. What's the word?</i>

66
00:06:43,617 --> 00:06:45,654
- Valuation.
- <i>Exactly.</i>

67
00:06:45,825 --> 00:06:49,200
<i>That is why I asked to speak to Mr. Oldman.
To make an appointment.</i>

68
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:52,100
Does Mr. Oldman already have
the pleasure of knowing you?

69
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:55,359
<i>Oh, no, not at all. He doesn't know me.</i>

70
00:06:55,533 --> 00:06:57,404
<i>But I know a lot about him.</i>

71
00:06:58,615 --> 00:07:01,800
Mr. Oldman's assistants are responsible
for preliminary assessments.

72
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,400
If you hold on, I'll put you through.

72
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,800
<i>Perhaps I didn't make myself clear.</i>

73
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,100
<i>I must speak to Mr. Oldman in person.</i>

74
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:11,300
Mr. Oldman never presides
over early appraisals.

75
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,400
<i>But you see, before he died,</i>

76
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,100
<i>Dad told me that if I decided
to sell everything,</i>

77
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,300
<i>I should entrust the auction sale
to Mr. Virgil Oldman.</i>

78
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,000
<i>In his opinion, the best.</i>

78
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Sold!

79
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:27,400
Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me
great pleasure to present lot 231,

80
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:32,852
an ancient refracting elongated telescope
constructed by the Italian scientist Galileo Galilei.

81
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,236
And it's still in perfect working order.

82
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,950
Can we open bidding, please,
at €1,000,000?

83
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,100
- 1,100,000.
- 1,100,000.

1,200,000.

88

91
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,700
2,500,000. I can sell it.

91
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,950
2,700,000.

92
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:11,550
At 2,700,000. Any more? Are we all done?

93
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,650
At €2,700,000 euros.

94
00:08:14,738 --> 00:08:16,395
Sold! Congratulations, sir.

95
00:08:16,695 --> 00:08:18,550
Lot 232.

96
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:22,598
Disciple of Boris Gregorian, Thurst.
Oil on canvas, 60 x 70.

97
00:08:22,903 --> 00:08:24,774
This one will go to the best offer.

98
00:08:25,944 --> 00:08:27,200
€1,000.

98
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,850

105
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,700
At €15,000.

106

107
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,934
Any more? Sold!

108
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,700
Beautiful, isn't it?

108
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,000
Yes. Very.

109
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,700
You never miss a trick, do you, governor?

110
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,472
- Who is it really?
- Yansky.

111
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:29,226
A Russian painter who died young
in the late '30s.

112
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,477
An outstanding landscape painter.

113
00:10:32,855 --> 00:10:36,433
But among his many splendid landscapes,
he painted three portraits.

114
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,305
Only three in his whole life.

115
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,978
And this is one of the three.

116
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,686
It's double, all right?

117
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,720
How long have we known each other, Virgil?

118
00:10:50,021 --> 00:10:51,098
Quite a while.

119
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:54,843
We've pulled off some sharp tricks
time after time.

120
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,638
Remember Milo Hensen?

121
00:10:56,812 --> 00:10:59,800
You were the only one who knew from
the start he was going to be really big.

122
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:02,597
We got that portrait of his mother for a song

123
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:06,200
from under the noses of that bunch of idiots.

124
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,894
Must be worth a fortune now.

125
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,466
You almost sound bitter
you didn't get a bit more.

126
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:13,341
Have we ever talked about money,
you and me?

127
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:16,050
- In all honesty, no. Never.
- It's been good enough for you.

128
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:18,467
It's always been good enough for me,
your misery.

129
00:11:18,645 --> 00:11:20,801
What matters is that you're satisfied.

130
00:11:21,103 --> 00:11:24,200
My only regret is never being able
to persuade you

131
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:27,765
that my paintings are evidence
of a great artistic talent.

132
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:32,000
The love of art and knowing how to hold
a brush doesn't make a man an artist.

134
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:35,677
You need an inner mystery. A knack,
my dear Billy, you've never possessed.

135
00:11:35,977 --> 00:11:39,094
You're right. Double wasn't enough.

136
00:13:55,761 --> 00:13:58,400
<i>In all my 36 years in this business,</i>

137
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:02,292
<i>never has anyone had the gall to keep
me waiting 40 minutes under the rain.</i>

138
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:05,135
It's a disgrace!
An appalling display of bad manners!

139
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:07,542
<i>Please, let me explain.
I tried to call you office.</i>

140
00:14:07,719 --> 00:14:09,793
- Be quiet! There's no excuse.
- <i>I tried to call your office.</i>

141
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,600
Never come near me again,
do you understand?

142
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,700
<i>But nobody answered and
I don't have your mobile number.</i>

143
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,041
I do not possess a mobile phone.

144
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:27,498
lt's the lbbetson woman on the phone.

145
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,503
- Tell her to go to hell.
- She's crying. Sounds desperate.

146
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,000
Serves her right.

147
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:34,305
She was hit by a car.
She was on her way to meet you.

148
00:14:34,484 --> 00:14:37,351
So much the worse for her.
It's no concern of mine.

149
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:39,060
She said she was left unconscious.

150
00:14:39,235 --> 00:14:42,434
She was lying in a pool of blood
when the ambulance arrived.

151
00:14:43,817 --> 00:14:46,140
All right. Put her through.

152
00:14:52,608 --> 00:14:55,014
- Yes?
- <i>Thank you. Please forgive me.</i>

153
00:14:55,316 --> 00:14:59,724
<i>I had no intention to be
in any way disrespectful.</i>

154
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,854
Nothing too serious, I hope.

155
00:15:02,024 --> 00:15:05,390
<i>No. Fortunately, they'll let me out tomorrow.</i>

156
00:15:05,566 --> 00:15:08,683
Good. Well, I hope you make
a speedy recovery.

157
00:15:08,857 --> 00:15:10,894
<i>Would you consent to make
a new appointment?</i>

158
00:15:12,023 --> 00:15:14,974
- <i>Please.</i>
- All right.

159
00:15:15,148 --> 00:15:17,139
But I must tell you I'm sending an assistant.

160
00:15:17,315 --> 00:15:20,313
<i>I hope it's the same one
that I spoke to last time.</i>

161
00:15:23,065 --> 00:15:24,227
What do you mean?

162
00:15:24,398 --> 00:15:27,561
<i>Well, I can't explain it,
but I understood from the outset</i>

163
00:15:27,732 --> 00:15:31,000
<i>that voice could only have been yours,
Mr. Oldman.</i>

164
00:15:31,522 --> 00:15:34,058
Truly surprising, wouldn't you say?

165
00:15:34,232 --> 00:15:37,016
We think we'll be able
to bring out the whole face,

166
00:15:37,189 --> 00:15:40,100
part of her dress and the left side
of the background.

167
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,764
Incredible! But what made
Mr. Oldman think that it would?

168
00:15:44,064 --> 00:15:46,682
- What period would you say it's from?
- Too soon to say.

169
00:15:46,855 --> 00:15:49,390
Perhaps Mr. Oldman
will be able to work this out

170
00:15:49,563 --> 00:15:51,685
more quickly and better than us.

171
00:15:53,606 --> 00:15:56,059
- It's a fake.
- How is that possible?

172
00:15:56,356 --> 00:15:58,511
- It's beautiful!
- I didn't say it was ugly.

173
00:15:58,688 --> 00:16:00,182
I said it wasn't authentic.

174
00:16:00,355 --> 00:16:02,724
From an initial analysis
of the pigments and wood,

175
00:16:03,021 --> 00:16:04,927
we thought it was pre-17th century.

176
00:16:05,105 --> 00:16:07,750
- Even older, if that matters.
- Then it must be worth something.

177
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:12,351
It is a work by Valiante, the celebrated
female forger of the 16th century.

178
00:16:12,646 --> 00:16:14,200
She copied the masterpieces of her day,

179
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,599
but she couldn't sign them,
because she was a woman.

180
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:21,000
So she marked them with a personal code
hidden in the folds of the drapery

182
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,640
or in the present case,
in the gaze of the subject.

183
00:16:23,937 --> 00:16:27,054
The beam of light on the iris
is nothing if not a V.

184
00:16:27,229 --> 00:16:28,650
That is Valiante.

185
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:33,427
It is worth something,
but nothing compared to the original.

186
00:16:55,228 --> 00:16:58,300
- Are you Mr. Oldman's assistant?
- Yes.

187
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,929
I'm Fred, the caretaker.
Pleased to meet you.

188
00:17:02,809 --> 00:17:05,477
- Please, come in.
- Thank you.

189
00:17:06,352 --> 00:17:07,382
And Miss lbbetson?

190
00:17:08,685 --> 00:17:09,929
Miss Ibbetson sends her apologies,

191
00:17:10,102 --> 00:17:12,671
but during the night
she was running a temperature.

192
00:17:12,851 --> 00:17:16,465
She should have called me. I could have
spared myself another wasted trip.

193
00:17:16,768 --> 00:17:18,473
Well, give her my best wishes.

194
00:17:18,642 --> 00:17:21,309
Miss Ibbetson asked if you would
go ahead with the valuation.

195
00:17:21,476 --> 00:17:23,632
She's instructed me to show
you around the house.

196
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:25,387
Everything's at your disposal.

196
00:17:26,509 --> 00:17:27,500
Come with me.

197
00:17:31,891 --> 00:17:34,511
In fact, Miss lbbetson was hoping
to meet your boss.

198
00:17:34,684 --> 00:17:37,764
It doesn't matter, considering
your mistress didn't show up either.

199
00:17:37,933 --> 00:17:39,095
Fair enough.

200
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:41,552
Anyway, I suppose it'll get
the job done quicker.

201
00:17:47,975 --> 00:17:49,384
Forgive the mess.

202
00:17:50,516 --> 00:17:54,427
It's gone to wrack and ruin ever since
Miss lbbetson's parents died.

203
00:17:56,515 --> 00:17:57,759
Let's go up.

204
00:17:59,723 --> 00:18:01,595
How long since the owners died?

205
00:18:01,765 --> 00:18:04,515
By the look of the place,
you'd think it was centuries ago,

206
00:18:04,682 --> 00:18:06,305
but it's only been one year.

207
00:18:06,599 --> 00:18:10,296
First Mrs. Ibbetson and then,
scarcely 45 days later,

208
00:18:10,474 --> 00:18:11,717
poor Mr. Ibbetson.

209
00:18:11,889 --> 00:18:14,556
You have a good look. Take your time.

210
00:18:14,723 --> 00:18:16,678
Just getting these curtains open.

211
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:20,089
Too many windows in this room.

212
00:18:25,849 --> 00:18:26,925
Okay.

213
00:18:31,223 --> 00:18:34,090
How many brothers and sisters
does Miss lbbetson have?

214
00:18:34,263 --> 00:18:35,804
None at all. She's an only child.

215
00:18:36,098 --> 00:18:37,838
- Is she married?
- No.

216
00:18:38,014 --> 00:18:40,633
- Has she ever been?
- No, no.

217
00:18:40,805 --> 00:18:43,009
I don't think she even has a boyfriend.

218
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:46,511
- Grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, in-laws?
- No, none at all.

219
00:18:46,805 --> 00:18:49,554
As far as I know,
Miss lbbetson is on her own.

220
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,710
So many rooms.

221
00:18:55,929 --> 00:18:58,500
You know, I've never managed
to count them all.

222
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:16,756
Have there been other valuations
before me?

223
00:19:16,928 --> 00:19:19,464
Absolutely none. Yours is the first.

224
00:19:19,762 --> 00:19:22,594
Miss lbbetson is extremely fond of this house.

225
00:19:22,762 --> 00:19:24,421
Maybe too fond.

226
00:19:24,596 --> 00:19:27,508
She would have prefer to keep everything,
but what can you do?

227
00:19:27,802 --> 00:19:30,635
The empire crumbles.
A woman on her own can't cope.

228
00:19:31,927 --> 00:19:35,009
Is she thinking of putting
the house up for sale as well?

229
00:19:35,178 --> 00:19:37,797
That, I don't know. Maybe a part of it.

230
00:19:38,095 --> 00:19:40,001
I don't think she'll get rid of the whole place.

231
00:19:40,302 --> 00:19:42,044
What kind of work does Miss Ibbetson do?

232
00:19:42,344 --> 00:19:45,625
I couldn't say. I only dealt with her parents.

233
00:19:48,594 --> 00:19:50,880
- May I see the cellars?
- It's this way.

234
00:19:52,177 --> 00:19:53,717
It's a long way down.

235
00:19:59,094 --> 00:20:00,254
Go ahead.

236
00:20:43,841 --> 00:20:45,250
I honestly don't get it.

237
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:48,422
In all the months I've known you,
Robert, I've never seen you beaten.

238
00:20:48,716 --> 00:20:51,630
I've watched you produce all manner
of weird and wonderful gadgets

239
00:20:51,799 --> 00:20:53,755
from the most unremarkable ironwork.

240
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:56,667
Optical or arithmetical devices, water clocks...

241
00:20:56,966 --> 00:21:01,254
Even that hairdryer that probably
dried the locks of Jules Verne's wife.

242
00:21:01,548 --> 00:21:04,795
But you've nothing to say
about this curious contraption?

243
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:07,838
I'm surprised that an art
connoisseur like yourself

244
00:21:08,007 --> 00:21:10,800
can get so carried away
by a banal piece of ironwork.

245
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:13,673
It's not the object in itself
that arouses my curiosity,

246
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,400
but it's contradiction.

247
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,456
- Contradiction?
- Look.

248
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:22,044
I found it in this position
in contact with damp flooring,

249
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:26,249
but the rust is all along the top
of the cogs, nowhere near the damp.

250
00:21:26,547 --> 00:21:27,659
What does all this mean?

251
00:21:27,964 --> 00:21:30,417
That the object plainly hadn't
been there for very long.

252
00:21:30,714 --> 00:21:34,542
Probably got rusted in some other place.
Or someone turned the thing upside down.

253
00:21:34,715 --> 00:21:38,043
That's all, nothing more than
a useless exercise in deduction.

254
00:21:38,295 --> 00:21:39,872
Hi, Robert. Did you manage it?

255
00:21:40,046 --> 00:21:41,700
Did you ever doubt me, huh?

256
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,206
This works perfectly now.

257
00:21:45,004 --> 00:21:48,000
And I transcribed the recording
from the tape.

258
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,300
You're a genius. How much do I owe you?

259
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,629
Oh, nothing.

260
00:21:51,963 --> 00:21:53,669
So maybe one day you'll invite me to diner.

261
00:21:53,837 --> 00:21:54,915
Count on it.

262
00:21:55,253 --> 00:21:57,700
- Can I give you a kiss?
- Yes, you can!

263
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,300
That is one thing I am good at.

264
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,495
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

265
00:22:01,837 --> 00:22:05,285
William Adolphe Bouguereau,
The Birth of Venus.

266
00:22:08,253 --> 00:22:09,283
Authentic.

267
00:22:12,671 --> 00:22:16,366
Umberto Veruda, The Honest, 1890.

268
00:22:34,794 --> 00:22:37,500
<i>You've been the talk of the town lately.</i>

269
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,500
<i>I was hoping to see you on television.</i>

270
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,583
I don't like to appear.
I prefer to remain in the shadows.

271
00:22:42,752 --> 00:22:44,327
<i>We're much the same that way.</i>

272
00:22:44,502 --> 00:22:46,100
That doesn't mean we'll be able to agree.

273
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,451
My secretary's been going mad
looking for you.

274
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:51,700
<i>How do you know that an unknown painter
will become famous and collectable?</i>

275
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:55,407
Intuition, Miss Ibbetson. The same intuition
that makes me doubt your intentions.

276
00:22:55,584 --> 00:22:59,600
<i>Sorry if I've given you that impression,
but I've already entrusted you with my belongings.</i>

277
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,120
That's not how things work.

278
00:23:01,293 --> 00:23:04,300
There has to be a signed contract
before an inventory can be drawn up.

279
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,100
It's a lenghty process,
and unless you stop fooling around

280
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:09,993
and decide to come out into the open,
it will never even get started.

281
00:23:10,166 --> 00:23:12,241
<i>Go ahead with the inventory, Mr. Oldman.</i>

282
00:23:12,416 --> 00:23:13,874
<i>The day you begin, I'll meet you at the villa.</i>

283
00:23:14,041 --> 00:23:17,000
<i>And we'll reach an agreement.
You have my word.</i>

285
00:23:17,583 --> 00:23:19,657
- Take these paper samples.
- Yes, sir.

286
00:23:19,834 --> 00:23:20,912
Be careful!

287
00:23:21,084 --> 00:23:23,203
I'm not sure, but it looks German to me.

288
00:23:23,375 --> 00:23:25,864
Austrian. Careful with that.

289
00:23:26,042 --> 00:23:28,200
It's almost 11:00,
the appointment was for 8:30.

290
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:32,077
Oh, she's not answering her mobile,
but if she said she'll come, she'll be here.

291
00:23:32,416 --> 00:23:34,620
It doesn't look like the piano
needs restoration.

292
00:23:34,791 --> 00:23:38,000
Quite so. We only have to check
the keyboard, but we don't have the key.

294
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,450
Well, here it is.

295
00:23:39,623 --> 00:23:42,743
- Last time there was no key on the lock.
- Looks good.

297
00:23:43,083 --> 00:23:44,907
Mr. Oldman!

298
00:23:45,083 --> 00:23:47,000
Would you help me with the bookcase?

299
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:50,158
Italian bookcase in solid wood.
First half of...

300
00:23:50,332 --> 00:23:51,361
Who smashed this?

301
00:23:51,539 --> 00:23:53,863
Nobody, Mr. Oldman, it was already broken.

302
00:23:54,039 --> 00:23:55,995
Is this part of the house inhabited?

303
00:23:56,164 --> 00:23:57,362
Why?

304
00:23:57,539 --> 00:23:59,700
There have been some changes.
I don't know why--

305
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,987
No, no, Mr...

306
00:24:01,165 --> 00:24:03,500
I'm sorry, I'm not sure of your name.

307
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:04,900
I thought you were...

308
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:06,496
It doesn't matter who I am.

309
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:08,203
But I assure you nobody lives here.

310
00:24:08,539 --> 00:24:11,700
Be that as it may, if your mistress
is not materialised by midday,

311
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,913
I will have no option but to suspend
operations and remove myself.

312
00:24:20,081 --> 00:24:21,159
Mr. Oldman!

313
00:24:25,995 --> 00:24:27,110
Miss lbbetson.

314
00:24:27,455 --> 00:24:29,326
<i>Hello, Mr. Oldman?</i>

315
00:24:29,496 --> 00:24:31,949
<i>Mr. Oldman, can you hear me?</i>

316
00:24:32,121 --> 00:24:35,900
<i>Mr. Oldman, I don't know how to apologise.
I don't know what must you think of me.</i>

317
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,600
At least spare me
the self-serving justifications.

318
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:39,600
<i>Please, let me speak.</i>

319
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:43,445
I cannot lay a hand on your possessions
without a signed contract. Is that clear?

320
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:46,488
<i>Would you be so kind and leave it
on the table in the hallway?</i>

321
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:49,150
<i>You'll find it signed.
I accept all your conditions.</i>

322
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:51,035
Yes, but I do not accept yours, Miss Ibbetson.

323
00:24:51,203 --> 00:24:54,616
I'm not in the habit of doing business with
the phantom of a silly, superficial woman!

324
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,700
- Be careful!
- <i>Be careful!</i>

325
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,073
<i>I can quite understand your exasperation,
Mr. Oldman.</i>

326
00:25:00,245 --> 00:25:03,000
<i>But please believe me
I didn't mean anything by it.</i>

327
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:07,445
<i>It's been a series of unfortunate,
unintentional mishaps.</i>

328
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,900
So what exactly happened today,
Miss Ibbetson?

329
00:25:10,119 --> 00:25:14,195
<i>My car was stolen and I had
to go to the police to report it.</i>

330
00:25:14,953 --> 00:25:17,442
Which police station did you go to?

331
00:25:17,619 --> 00:25:21,100
- <i>The one in the city centre.</i>
- Whereabouts in the city centre?

332
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,600
- <i>On the main square.</i>
- Which square?

333
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:25,100
<i>That's enough of this interrogation!
No more of this!</i>

334
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,400
<i>Who do you think you are?!</i>

335
00:25:32,703 --> 00:25:34,409
Are you here, Miss lbbetson?

336
00:25:34,578 --> 00:25:36,700
<i>What do you mean?
What kind of question is that?</i>

337
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,100
Are you here?

338
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,690
<i>I don't understand. I don't understand.</i>

339
00:25:40,868 --> 00:25:43,000
- lf you're here, come out at once and explain
- <i>Stop it!</i>

340
00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:46,300
the meaning of this senseless game,
which I do not find in the least amusing.

341
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,739
<i>Call me tonight at around 9 o'clock.
I'll explain everything.</i>

342
00:25:52,117 --> 00:25:54,025
Well, it's the same material

343
00:25:54,201 --> 00:25:55,989
and the same workmanship too.

344
00:25:56,325 --> 00:25:58,197
Yeah, there is no doubt these
belong to the same system.

345
00:25:58,534 --> 00:26:01,200
There's no signature, no mark, no inscription?

346
00:26:02,451 --> 00:26:07,031
I mean, I've got the rust and
the oxidisation off the other piece.

347
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:09,480
There's nothing.

348
00:26:09,826 --> 00:26:14,777
I can do the same with these, but,
I mean, right now, I can't see anything.

349
00:26:18,533 --> 00:26:20,439
What have you found?

350
00:26:20,782 --> 00:26:23,983
The technique, in which the cog
has been attached to it's axis.

351
00:26:24,157 --> 00:26:26,729
I mean, it's old, really old.
I've never seen anything like it.

352
00:26:26,908 --> 00:26:29,029
Here, look. Have a look.

353
00:26:36,781 --> 00:26:39,050
It's 18th century.

354
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:41,397
We could be onto something big here.

355
00:26:41,574 --> 00:26:43,445
Could you hazard a guess as to what it is?

356
00:26:44,907 --> 00:26:47,940
Three pieces of the mosaic
is just not enough, Mr Oldman.

357
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:52,441
In the last few years
the old couple were both unwell.

358
00:26:52,613 --> 00:26:54,900
The house was in a terrible state even then.

359
00:26:56,155 --> 00:26:59,687
Mr. lbbetson was always saying that
sooner or later they'd have to sell something.

360
00:27:00,031 --> 00:27:01,986
And Miss Claire. How old is she?

361
00:27:03,823 --> 00:27:05,445
About 27.

362
00:27:06,823 --> 00:27:09,227
What else can you tell me about her?

363
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:10,950
Nothing really.

364
00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:14,318
I've never had much to do with her.
I don't really know her at all.

365
00:27:14,655 --> 00:27:18,813
And yet you've been in the service
of the lbbetsons for about 10 years.

366
00:27:21,071 --> 00:27:23,774
Well, 11 years to be exact.

367
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:26,062
But as I was saying,
I didn't have much to do with her.

368
00:27:26,405 --> 00:27:28,950
I've talked to her a thousand times
at all hours, but...

369
00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:30,404
But?

370
00:27:30,737 --> 00:27:32,776
To tell you the truth, I've never seen her.

371
00:27:33,154 --> 00:27:36,650
- How could that be?
- It's the truth. Not once.

372
00:27:36,987 --> 00:27:38,527
Why?

373
00:27:40,571 --> 00:27:45,312
Because Miss Claire suffers
from a very strange illness.

374
00:27:46,486 --> 00:27:49,354
- <i>Hello.</i>
- Good evening, Miss Ibbetson. It's Oldman here.

375
00:27:49,527 --> 00:27:50,985
<i>I was expecting you to call.</i>

376
00:27:51,153 --> 00:27:54,850
Believe me, I have no wish to quarrel
and I'm sorry if I was rude today.

377
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:55,981
<i>It doesn't matter.</i>

378
00:27:56,153 --> 00:27:58,500
But if on one hand I confirm I am available,

379
00:27:58,550 --> 00:28:02,643
at the same time I cannot permit this joke
in poor taste to continue any longer.

380
00:28:02,986 --> 00:28:05,604
<i>I wish to tell you to cease
all involvement in my affairs.</i>

381
00:28:05,777 --> 00:28:07,483
<i>I apologise for the trouble I've caused you.</i>

382
00:28:07,652 --> 00:28:09,800
<i>Let me have your bill for expenses.
Good night.</i>

383
00:28:17,652 --> 00:28:20,000
Lot 93. Valiante. Portrait of a Lady.

384
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,400
First half of the 16th century,

385
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:24,897
inspired by the Portrait of
a Young Girl by Petrus Christus.

386
00:28:25,068 --> 00:28:26,182
Oil on wood. 30 x 40.

387
00:28:26,526 --> 00:28:28,932
I have here an opening bid of £20,000.

388
00:28:29,276 --> 00:28:31,812
- 22,000.
- 22,000.

389
00:28:31,985 --> 00:28:33,300
24,000.

389
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,935
26,000 on the telephone.

390
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,700
28,000 in the room.

390
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,273
30,000.

391
00:28:38,609 --> 00:28:40,399
35,000. Thank you, sir.

392
00:28:41,193 --> 00:28:42,800
40,000 on the telephone.

392
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:44,475
45,000 in the room.

393
00:28:44,651 --> 00:28:45,978
50,000.

394
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,200
55,000.

394
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:49,000
60,000.

394
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,800
65,000 on the telephone.

395
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:52,500
70,000.

395
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,769
At 70,000.

396
00:28:53,942 --> 00:28:56,200
Any advance on 70,000?

396
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,065
75,000.

397
00:28:58,401 --> 00:28:59,400
80,000 on the telephone.

397
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:00,450
Any more?

398
00:29:00,607 --> 00:29:02,479
All done at £80,000.

399
00:29:02,816 --> 00:29:04,474
All done at 80,000.

400
00:29:05,732 --> 00:29:07,400
£90,000.

400
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,500
Any more?

401
00:29:09,567 --> 00:29:10,810
Sold!

402
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,721
- Thank you, sir.
- I offered £90,000 too.

403
00:29:15,067 --> 00:29:18,017
Mr. Oldman should have been aware of that.

404
00:29:18,357 --> 00:29:22,250
I don't believe so, Mrs. Durane.
Mr. Whistler made the bid of £90,000.

405
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:25,513
- He was the only one.
- They bid simultaneously.

406
00:29:25,691 --> 00:29:28,096
She got her bid in first. I saw it.

407
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,813
What should we do, Mr. Oldman?

408
00:29:29,982 --> 00:29:34,355
I am the biggest collector of
Valiante forgeries and I'll sue you!

409
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:37,000
You were too slow, Billy!
That's all there is to it!

409
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,300
You didn't get in with your bid in time!

410
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,300
And you were too late! Too late!

411
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,768
You didn't keep up with me for Christ's sake!

412
00:29:43,105 --> 00:29:45,938
The old trout was behind me. If I'd seen her,
I'd have committed another bid.

413
00:29:46,272 --> 00:29:48,145
You're losing it! You're losing it! You're losing it!

414
00:29:48,314 --> 00:29:50,850
Maybe you're right, maybe I'm
not up to it like I used to be,

415
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:52,500
but it's not the first time we've messed up.

416
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:56,059
It's the way things go.
Never went into a rage like this before.

417
00:29:57,855 --> 00:29:59,850
That wasn't a Valiante forgery.

418
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:02,433
It was the genuine one article
by Petrus Christus.

419
00:30:03,271 --> 00:30:05,725
It'll be worth £8 million.

420
00:30:07,896 --> 00:30:09,555
Woe be me.

421
00:30:11,272 --> 00:30:13,144
I'm sorry. Honestly.

422
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:17,809
But even when we lost Van Gogh's
Lady With The Fan,

423
00:30:17,979 --> 00:30:19,803
you didn't take it this hard.

424
00:30:20,646 --> 00:30:22,352
What's going on, Virgil?

425
00:30:26,354 --> 00:30:28,226
642.

426
00:30:28,396 --> 00:30:29,936
729.

427
00:30:31,478 --> 00:30:33,700
918.

428
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:36,259
1,011.

429
00:30:36,602 --> 00:30:39,933
1,119.

430
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:42,593
1,320.

431
00:30:42,937 --> 00:30:45,177
1,404.

432
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:47,724
- What will you have?
- 1,581.

433
00:30:47,894 --> 00:30:48,925
Tea, thank you.

434
00:30:52,436 --> 00:30:54,094
8,109.

435
00:30:54,436 --> 00:30:56,391
8,725.

436
00:30:56,727 --> 00:30:59,808
Sorry, darling, 8,625.

437
00:30:59,978 --> 00:31:02,547
8,725!

438
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:05,009
8,725!

439
00:31:05,185 --> 00:31:07,300
Take a closer look, you moron.

440
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:11,100
Shit, You're right! 8,725. Well done, girl!

441
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,267
That's it?

442
00:31:24,185 --> 00:31:25,725
- Bye!
- Bye!

443
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:31,718
I gave them a thorough clean
with this special fluid.

444
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:34,767
And I have studied them
millimetre by millimetre.

445
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:37,220
And look what's come up.

446
00:31:38,267 --> 00:31:39,298
Vaucanson!

447
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:43,500
- I can't believe it!
- Jacques Vaucanson.

448
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,950
18th century constructor of automata.

449
00:31:46,225 --> 00:31:48,973
When I was a student, I did my thesis on him.

450
00:31:49,308 --> 00:31:51,133
That's incredible!

451
00:31:51,308 --> 00:31:54,472
It seems one of his most famous
androids even managed to talk.

452
00:31:54,641 --> 00:31:57,889
Exactly. People would pay money
to ask it questions.

453
00:31:58,058 --> 00:32:02,928
The android would move its head,
bow, and give its reply.

454
00:32:03,308 --> 00:32:05,178
You know, I bet there was
someone hiding inside.

455
00:32:05,348 --> 00:32:06,805
A dwarf maybe.

456
00:32:06,973 --> 00:32:10,671
Just like Edgar Allan Poe suspected
in the case of Maelzel's Chess Player, huh?

457
00:32:10,848 --> 00:32:12,053
More than likely.

458
00:32:12,224 --> 00:32:15,509
But the mystery that nobody
was ever able to explain

459
00:32:15,682 --> 00:32:18,514
was how Vaucanson's
automaton always got it right.

460
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:22,173
Of course there was some trickery
in making the automaton talk.

461
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,381
But everything it said was true.

462
00:32:27,015 --> 00:32:28,757
You bring me all the pieces,

463
00:32:28,931 --> 00:32:33,007
and I promise I can put them back together
exactly how Vaucanson had them.

464
00:32:33,181 --> 00:32:37,715
I don't doubt it, but I fear I've lost the chance
of getting my hands on the missing pieces.

466
00:32:38,056 --> 00:32:40,675
Well, they must be in the same place
that you found these.

467
00:32:41,015 --> 00:32:43,253
And all I need is 80% of the elements,

468
00:32:43,431 --> 00:32:46,297
and I can work out the rest
and rebuild it myself.

469
00:32:46,472 --> 00:32:48,379
It's not that easy.

470
00:32:49,971 --> 00:32:52,010
I'm sorry, Mr. Oldman. That's my girlfriend.

471
00:32:53,264 --> 00:32:55,966
Hey, Sarah. Sarah, this is Mr. Virgil Oldman.

472
00:33:00,221 --> 00:33:01,843
Pleased to meet you, Sarah.

473
00:33:02,013 --> 00:33:05,046
It's a pleasure. Robert has told me
so much about you.

474
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:08,100
I thought young people had more
exciting things to talk about.

475
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,213
Listen, why don't you come
and grab a bite with us?

476
00:33:10,388 --> 00:33:12,758
That's very kind. Another time, thank you.

477
00:33:13,138 --> 00:33:15,590
All right, we won't insist. But it's a promise.

478
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:17,635
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

479
00:33:24,012 --> 00:33:27,424
Cancel the trip to New York and tell
the Alphasons to meet us here.

480
00:33:27,762 --> 00:33:29,419
It was us who called the meeting.

481
00:33:29,803 --> 00:33:32,600
So we've changed our minds.
Is that a problem?

482
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:34,208
All right, Mr. Oldman.

483
00:33:39,261 --> 00:33:40,967
Claire lbbetson's been on the phone.

484
00:33:42,178 --> 00:33:43,456
What does she want now?

485
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,709
She asked whether you could
meet her today at 2:30.

486
00:33:46,053 --> 00:33:47,841
Meet her where?

487
00:33:48,178 --> 00:33:50,085
At the lbbetson villa.

488
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:51,670
Where else?

489
00:34:47,925 --> 00:34:52,415
<i>I'm extremely grateful to you for
accepting the invitation, Mr. Oldman.</i>

490
00:34:54,007 --> 00:34:56,129
How did you know it was me?

491
00:34:56,299 --> 00:34:58,503
<i>Fred has a limp. You don't.</i>

492
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,214
Ah.

493
00:35:01,799 --> 00:35:04,666
To be honest I didn't expect
you'd want to speak to me.

494
00:35:06,007 --> 00:35:09,669
<i>I know you can't stand my excuses.
If I were you, I wouldn't either.</i>

495
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:12,458
In fact, your beh... How should I put it?

497
00:35:12,631 --> 00:35:14,254
<i>Speak frankly. Don't worry.</i>

498
00:35:16,256 --> 00:35:20,172
I won't deny that your whimsical little
ways are getting a bit tiresome.

500
00:35:22,256 --> 00:35:23,797
<i>I hope not too tiresome.</i>

501
00:35:25,131 --> 00:35:29,337
<i>But I wanted to say sorry for...
well, for my behaviour.</i>

502
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:33,876
<i>Typical of a "silly, superficial woman",
as you put it.</i>

503
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:36,795
Why do you systematically
avoid meeting me?

504
00:35:36,964 --> 00:35:39,085
<i>Nothing personal, believe me.</i>

505
00:35:39,256 --> 00:35:41,700
Of course I wouldn't assume 
you'd want to do business

506
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:44,300
with a person who arouses
such deep seeded aversion in you

507
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:46,826
that you can't even look him in the face?

508
00:35:47,296 --> 00:35:50,500
<i>It's not easy to explain to you, because
I know you won't believe me anyway.</i>

509
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:54,960
If I didn't believe you, I wouldn't be
here playing hide and seek.

510
00:35:55,130 --> 00:35:56,586
<i>I don't meet many people.</i>

511
00:35:57,837 --> 00:35:59,994
<i>It's been a long time now.</i>

512
00:36:00,171 --> 00:36:03,169
I see nothing serious in that.

513
00:36:03,337 --> 00:36:07,414
Everybody has moments when
they prefer solitude to the multitudes.

515
00:36:07,587 --> 00:36:10,419
<i>I haven't left this house since I was 15.</i>

516
00:36:11,253 --> 00:36:14,417
- I don't think I understand.
- <i>You understand perfectly.</i>

517
00:36:14,753 --> 00:36:16,163
<i>This is my room.</i>

518
00:36:16,336 --> 00:36:18,956
<i>If there's somebody wandering
around the house or in the villa,</i>

519
00:36:19,128 --> 00:36:21,166
<i>I lock myself up in here.</i>

520
00:36:21,337 --> 00:36:25,033
<i>I've always done that,
even when my parents were here.</i>

521
00:36:25,211 --> 00:36:26,833
<i>I hardly ever saw them.</i>

522
00:36:27,002 --> 00:36:28,200
<i>I don't see anybody.</i>

523
00:36:29,168 --> 00:36:30,247
But why?

524
00:36:30,419 --> 00:36:33,620
<i>Why do you go around with
your hands covered by gloves?</i>

525
00:36:33,794 --> 00:36:36,792
lt's a simple question of hygiene.
I don't see the connection.

526
00:36:36,961 --> 00:36:38,833
<i>You're afraid of touching others.</i>

527
00:36:39,003 --> 00:36:41,288
<i>It disgusts you to put your hands
near their possessions.</i>

528
00:36:41,628 --> 00:36:44,495
<i>I'm afraid of going to places
where other people live.</i>

529
00:36:44,668 --> 00:36:47,452
<i>These seem to me very
similar personal choices.</i>

530
00:36:48,627 --> 00:36:52,324
You'd like me to believe that for 12 years
you haven't walked along a street?

531
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:53,865
<i>I see you know my age.</i>

532
00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:58,120
Wanting to be a hermit and employing
a caretaker in the house doesn't add up.

533
00:36:58,459 --> 00:37:01,740
<i>I walk about quite a bit,
if that's what you want to know.</i>

534
00:37:01,918 --> 00:37:05,034
<i>Inside the villa when there's nobody here.</i>

535
00:37:05,209 --> 00:37:08,160
<i>Which is often now. But I never go out.</i>

536
00:37:09,334 --> 00:37:11,489
<i>The very idea paralyses me.</i>

537
00:37:14,167 --> 00:37:16,205
<i>I hope you understand me now.</i>

538
00:37:16,541 --> 00:37:19,825
<i>And I hope that, within the limits
of your profession, you'll help me.</i>

539
00:37:21,167 --> 00:37:23,122
You have my word, Miss lbbetson.

540
00:37:23,291 --> 00:37:25,600
<i>As to any agreement between us,</i>

541
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:28,200
<i>I leave it to you to set your fee.
I trust you blindly.</i>

542
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:33,455
<i>Leave the contract on the table.</i>

543
00:37:33,791 --> 00:37:35,618
<i>You'll find it signed next time.</i>

544
00:37:35,791 --> 00:37:37,369
<i>Now, please, I'm very tired.</i>

545
00:37:50,167 --> 00:37:52,453
Apart from your fondness for my gloves,

546
00:37:52,792 --> 00:37:54,600
what made you decide to call me again?

547
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:56,500
I haven't been particularly kind to you.

548
00:37:57,456 --> 00:38:00,869
<i>I was taken by the way you were
looking at my house yesterday</i>

549
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,450
<i>from the bar opposite.</i>

550
00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:08,246
You found the missing pieces.

551
00:38:08,415 --> 00:38:12,000
In the meantime, you'll have
to make do with just this one.

552
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:14,000
How much would the automaton be worth,

553
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:16,743
if we managed to put it together
and make it work?

554
00:38:16,914 --> 00:38:18,821
Think of a really, really high figure.

555
00:38:20,998 --> 00:38:23,450
- Do you have one in mind?
- Yes.

556
00:38:23,665 --> 00:38:25,950
You've probably made the mistake
of pitching it too low.

557
00:38:26,205 --> 00:38:28,954
You know, you're very good at talking
without actually saying anything.

558
00:38:29,289 --> 00:38:31,410
I'll take that as a compliment.

559
00:38:32,039 --> 00:38:34,360
In any case, should things go
the way I trust they will,

560
00:38:34,539 --> 00:38:36,576
you'll be very handsomely rewarded.

561
00:38:36,914 --> 00:38:40,858
Listen, I didn't mean to talk about money.
It's a real privilege for me.

562
00:38:41,038 --> 00:38:42,614
Where did you on earth find these rarities?

563
00:38:42,954 --> 00:38:46,154
There are very precise rules
in the world of antiques.

564
00:38:46,330 --> 00:38:48,617
It's forbidden to reveal one's sources.

565
00:38:57,287 --> 00:39:00,201
There's a few more gears
but bigger in that corner.

566
00:39:00,371 --> 00:39:03,902
Gather them together. I'll take
care of the cataloguing myself.

567
00:39:04,078 --> 00:39:05,109
Of course.

568
00:39:06,246 --> 00:39:07,443
Candlesticks.

569
00:39:07,621 --> 00:39:10,369
- Which period?
- 17th-century. Repair.

570
00:39:12,286 --> 00:39:13,364
Mr. Oldman.

571
00:39:19,203 --> 00:39:20,482
<i>Mr. Oldman.</i>

572
00:39:21,662 --> 00:39:22,823
Yes?

573
00:39:22,994 --> 00:39:25,992
<i>What have you decided
about the furniture in this wing?</i>

574
00:39:26,162 --> 00:39:28,234
We're only at the stage of
drawing up the inventory.

575
00:39:28,411 --> 00:39:30,530
After that, you can tell me what to leave out.

576
00:39:30,702 --> 00:39:31,779
<i>Thank you.</i>

577
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:38,150
Listen, Miss lbbetson, I can't help
thinking about your situation.

578
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:40,565
<i>I'm sorry to have intruded on your thoughts.</i>

579
00:39:40,743 --> 00:39:42,319
That's not the point.

580
00:39:42,494 --> 00:39:45,113
I've been wondering how
you can live like this.

581
00:39:45,285 --> 00:39:47,358
<i>I'm quite organised and totally self-sufficient.</i>

582
00:39:47,535 --> 00:39:50,367
<i>I don't need any help,
but I appreciate your concern.</i>

583
00:39:50,535 --> 00:39:51,862
You're welcome.

584
00:39:54,659 --> 00:39:57,194
- See you soon, then.
- <i>Have a good day.</i>

585
00:39:59,534 --> 00:40:00,696
<i>Mr. Oldman!</i>

586
00:40:02,785 --> 00:40:04,158
<i>Your contract.</i>

587
00:40:20,075 --> 00:40:21,900
<i>I read it and it seems fine to me.</i>

588
00:40:22,283 --> 00:40:24,770
<i>I initialled every page and signed the last.</i>

589
00:40:24,949 --> 00:40:26,773
<i>That's how it's done, isn't it?</i>

590
00:40:26,949 --> 00:40:28,062
Perfect.

591
00:40:28,241 --> 00:40:30,527
But I see your personal details are missing.

592
00:40:34,283 --> 00:40:35,775
<i>Take them from my passport.</i>

593
00:40:46,365 --> 00:40:48,600
But it expired quite some time ago.

594
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:52,100
- <i>Personal details never expire.</i>
- That's true enough, I suppose.

595
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:55,149
<i>I was just a girl then,
but it'll do for your purposes.</i>

596
00:41:10,114 --> 00:41:12,500
I wanted to mention
that in certain critical cases

597
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:15,800
my advice is to proceed
directly to restoration.

598
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:17,269
<i>You know best.</i>

599
00:41:17,447 --> 00:41:20,195
It means the whole thing
will take a little longer.

600
00:41:20,364 --> 00:41:22,685
We can widen the scope of the valuation.

601
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:24,143
<i>I understand.</i>

602
00:41:39,279 --> 00:41:41,352
<i>You dye your hair. I never noticed.</i>

603
00:41:41,695 --> 00:41:45,000
<i>I'm disgusted by people who don't
trust the colour of their own hair!</i>

604
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:48,100
I trust even less people who have
such a high opinion of themselves

605
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,355
that they won't even poke
their nose outside the door!

606
00:41:51,778 --> 00:41:55,724
Ah, sir, there'll be no more
caretaker service as from Monday.

607
00:41:55,904 --> 00:41:58,854
I'll just come in to bring
Miss lbbetson her shopping.

608
00:41:59,028 --> 00:42:02,144
- The matter is of little interest to me.
- These are the keys for the house.

609
00:42:03,279 --> 00:42:07,200
- Why give them to me?
- It's what Miss lbbetson wanted.

610
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:10,395
In case you needed access
for further inspection.

611
00:42:13,237 --> 00:42:15,309
When you come in, slam the door,

612
00:42:15,653 --> 00:42:18,105
otherwise she'll get scared and panic.

613
00:42:30,528 --> 00:42:35,000
I'm going off my head trying to work out
the alignment of these devices,

615
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:38,019
you know, just trying to figure out
which one fitted into which.

616
00:42:38,192 --> 00:42:40,563
- That can't be easy.
- But not impossible.

617
00:42:42,068 --> 00:42:44,520
You know, gearboxes are like people.

618
00:42:45,443 --> 00:42:47,647
If they've been together long enough, then,

619
00:42:47,818 --> 00:42:50,306
eventually, they take on each other's forms.

620
00:42:51,234 --> 00:42:55,558
So, you believe time can make
any kind of co-habitation possible?

621
00:42:55,734 --> 00:42:57,309
Yeah, well, absolutely.

622
00:42:57,651 --> 00:43:00,897
You've reminded me of a friend of mine,
who met a much younger girl.

623
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,600
She was inflicted with agoraphobia.

624
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:05,097
What's that?
Fear of open spaces and distances?

625
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:09,388
Exactly. She lived for years locked
up in an apartment on her own.

626
00:43:10,607 --> 00:43:14,897
Recently, she gave him the keys
to her house and ever since,

627
00:43:15,066 --> 00:43:17,222
he's been in a state of...

628
00:43:18,816 --> 00:43:20,189
...permanent anxiety.

629
00:43:22,982 --> 00:43:26,479
What did I tell you? Now he's gonna
be constantly worried about her.

630
00:43:26,816 --> 00:43:27,700
He's gonna be thinking,

631
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:31,929
"What does she need,
shampoo, medicine, tights, yoghurt?"

632
00:43:32,274 --> 00:43:33,815
lt's beautiful, isn't it?

633
00:43:34,689 --> 00:43:36,000
I'm not so sure.

634
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:38,312
Now, you tell your friend to stay calm,

635
00:43:38,482 --> 00:43:41,313
'cause time is already working
on their gearboxes.

636
00:43:50,355 --> 00:43:52,476
And there you are, Mr. Oldman.

637
00:43:56,939 --> 00:43:59,724
- <i>Are you angry with me?</i>
- Why should I be?

638
00:43:59,898 --> 00:44:02,468
- <i>What I said about your hair.</i>
- Not at all.

639
00:44:03,524 --> 00:44:04,900
I was just calling to ask if you wish

640
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:09,181
the sale of the furniture to be
identified by your family name.

641
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:11,227
Or do you prefer anonymity?

642
00:44:11,397 --> 00:44:13,933
- <i>Anonymity, anonymity.</i>
- Good.

643
00:44:15,064 --> 00:44:16,888
<i>This time, I did see you.</i>

644
00:44:17,064 --> 00:44:18,556
- Oh?
- <i>On TV.</i>

645
00:44:18,731 --> 00:44:21,728
I don't generally give interviews,
but I was forced to.

646
00:44:21,897 --> 00:44:23,722
<i>You're more intriguing this way.</i>

647
00:44:23,897 --> 00:44:26,562
<i>You'll be a great success with the ladies.</i>

648
00:44:26,896 --> 00:44:28,933
So, we go to Lot 132.

649
00:44:29,105 --> 00:44:31,640
Gustave Rett,
Portrait of a Woman With a Hat.

650
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:37,051
1956. Oil on canvas. 80 x 100 cm.

651
00:44:37,228 --> 00:44:39,599
This one goes to the best offer.

652
00:44:39,937 --> 00:44:41,560
£10,000.

653
00:44:51,395 --> 00:44:54,842
Fred, any news from Miss lbbetson?
She hasn't answered the phone in days.

654
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:57,259
<i>It's been a while since
I heard from her too.</i>

655
00:44:57,437 --> 00:44:59,261
<i>I've been in bed all week with pneumonia.</i>

656
00:44:59,603 --> 00:45:01,391
Who's been bringing things to eat?

657
00:45:09,477 --> 00:45:10,756
Miss lbbetson?

658
00:45:17,478 --> 00:45:19,017
Miss lbbetson?

659
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:31,472
Miss lbbetson, answer me!

660
00:45:35,059 --> 00:45:37,263
Claire?

661
00:45:38,975 --> 00:45:40,349
Claire, are you all right?

662
00:45:41,850 --> 00:45:43,639
- <i>Oh, no! Please!</i>
- No, no.

663
00:45:43,809 --> 00:45:45,700
- It's me, Claire.
- <i>Get out!</i>

664
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:47,805
- It's me, Mr. Oldman.
- <i>Get out! Go away!</i>

665
00:45:47,975 --> 00:45:50,261
- Listen to me, it's Mr. Oldman.
- <i>Get out!</i>

666
00:45:50,434 --> 00:45:52,970
There's nobody else here. Calm down.

667
00:45:53,142 --> 00:45:55,179
Claire, what's wrong?
Tell me what happened.

668
00:45:56,433 --> 00:45:57,925
<i>I wasn't well.</i>

669
00:45:58,100 --> 00:46:00,137
<i>I didn't know who to call.</i>

670
00:46:00,308 --> 00:46:01,470
<i>Nobody answered.</i>

671
00:46:01,642 --> 00:46:03,964
<i>And then I fell.</i>

672
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:07,092
<i>I fell and I hit my...</i>

673
00:46:07,432 --> 00:46:09,139
- Claire, open the door!
- <i>No, no!</i>

674
00:46:09,474 --> 00:46:11,015
- You need to see a doctor!
- <i>No, please!</i>

675
00:46:11,349 --> 00:46:14,017
<i>Please! Please!</i>

676
00:46:14,350 --> 00:46:16,672
<i>Please, no!</i>

677
00:46:19,765 --> 00:46:21,969
Can you fix a broken auctioneer as well?

678
00:46:22,307 --> 00:46:24,096
I wouldn't know where to begin.

679
00:46:24,432 --> 00:46:26,754
It's good to see you again, Mr. Oldman.

680
00:46:26,932 --> 00:46:30,547
Is something wrong? You seem
more preoccupied than usual.

681
00:46:30,724 --> 00:46:32,679
Too many woodworms and spider webs

682
00:46:32,848 --> 00:46:35,087
and too few masterpieces.

683
00:46:35,264 --> 00:46:36,805
Could we put it that way?

684
00:46:38,098 --> 00:46:40,668
- So, how's our toy coming along?
- Ah.

685
00:46:40,848 --> 00:46:43,929
Well, I've managed to put
some sections back together.

686
00:46:45,806 --> 00:46:49,503
But, I mean, there's just still
too many pieces missing.

687
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:52,427
The entire exterior.

688
00:46:52,764 --> 00:46:55,595
And we still can't establish
what kind of character he is.

689
00:46:55,930 --> 00:46:58,419
Like that friend of mine
and his girl in the tower.

690
00:46:58,764 --> 00:47:01,631
Yeah, well, maybe.
Although we've never seen our android.

691
00:47:01,804 --> 00:47:03,960
We're still groping around in the dark.

692
00:47:04,305 --> 00:47:05,679
So is he.

693
00:47:06,096 --> 00:47:08,336
He speaks to her but through a closed door.

694
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:10,753
- Closed door?
- Yes.

695
00:47:10,929 --> 00:47:15,005
If there's anybody moving about in the house,
she barricades herself in her room.

696
00:47:15,346 --> 00:47:19,504
- You mean he's never seen her face?
- Not only him, no one has.

697
00:47:19,679 --> 00:47:22,677
That's a bit like when two young people
meet on the internet.

698
00:47:23,013 --> 00:47:26,129
The first day they get to know each other,
and then they reveal themselves.

699
00:47:26,304 --> 00:47:28,010
She won't reveal herself.

700
00:47:28,150 --> 00:47:31,046
Maybe that's because
he hasn't got a good strategy.

701
00:47:32,512 --> 00:47:36,050
So, it's more difficult for my friend
to succeed in his enterprise

702
00:47:36,150 --> 00:47:39,213
than for us to reconstruct
the Vaucanson automaton?

703
00:47:39,387 --> 00:47:43,215
Depends on the number of rusty
pieces you're able to bring me.

704
00:47:43,553 --> 00:47:44,927
Well...

705
00:47:46,137 --> 00:47:47,676
Here's one more.

706
00:47:49,677 --> 00:47:51,170
That's a mobile phone.

707
00:47:52,469 --> 00:47:53,499
This is brand new.

708
00:47:53,677 --> 00:47:56,959
I'm the one that's rusty,
because I don't know how to use it.

709
00:47:57,303 --> 00:48:00,253
Do you think you could teach me
before your girlfriend gets here?

710
00:48:19,343 --> 00:48:21,800
- Hello.
- <i>Good evening, Mr. Oldman.</i>

711
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:24,000
<i>It's Claire Ibbetson. Am I disturbing you?</i>

712
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:26,506
- <i>Is it too late?</i>
- No, not at all, Miss lbbetson.

713
00:48:26,675 --> 00:48:30,171
I told you, from now on,
you can call me any time you like.

714
00:48:30,341 --> 00:48:31,882
<i>I wanted to thank you for...</i>

715
00:48:33,009 --> 00:48:34,585
<i>...everything, really.</i>

716
00:48:34,759 --> 00:48:38,171
No need. All that's important
is you're feeling better now.

717
00:48:38,342 --> 00:48:41,500
<i>Yes, it was just a small cut
on the head. I'm much better.</i>

718
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:44,293
<i>I wanted to tell you,
I looked over the inventory.</i>

719
00:48:44,633 --> 00:48:46,872
Oh! What do you think?

720
00:48:48,133 --> 00:48:50,455
<i>You've done a great job. Really, you have.</i>

721
00:48:51,675 --> 00:48:53,831
<i>But I'm troubled by so many doubts.</i>

722
00:48:54,008 --> 00:48:57,705
<i>I'm not sure if it's a good idea to sell.
What would you advise?</i>

723
00:48:57,884 --> 00:49:00,667
I couldn't say. I don't really
know what your plans are.

724
00:49:01,008 --> 00:49:03,578
Why did you decide to sell in the first place?

725
00:49:03,757 --> 00:49:07,621
Out of necessity in order to start
life afresh or some other reason?

726
00:49:07,966 --> 00:49:09,920
<i>All of the above, I suppose.</i>

727
00:49:10,091 --> 00:49:13,124
<i>I'd even sell the house.
It's too big for me now.</i>

728
00:49:13,299 --> 00:49:16,960
<i>Sometimes, I feel as though
I were in a public square.</i>

729
00:49:17,132 --> 00:49:19,169
<i>I'd like something smaller.</i>

730
00:49:19,340 --> 00:49:21,300
<i>But the idea of having to leave here</i>

731
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:23,709
<i>and go somewhere else fills me with dread.</i>

732
00:49:23,882 --> 00:49:25,504
<i>How would I manage it?</i>

733
00:49:25,673 --> 00:49:28,955
<i>Wear blindfolds? Have myself
carried out while asleep?</i>

734
00:49:29,133 --> 00:49:32,461
<i>I'd get into a state and end up
putting everything off again and again.</i>

735
00:49:35,548 --> 00:49:38,498
You have all the time in the world
to make up your mind, Miss Ibbetson.

736
00:49:38,797 --> 00:49:41,748
- <i>You think?</i>
- Well, I mean until the catalogue is printed.

737
00:49:42,089 --> 00:49:46,034
Don't torment yourself.
Think of yourself, your future.

738
00:49:46,213 --> 00:49:48,287
<i>That's the biggest torment of all.</i>

739
00:49:48,629 --> 00:49:50,786
<i>When I think about it, I can't even work.</i>

740
00:49:50,964 --> 00:49:53,369
I didn't know you were working.

741
00:49:53,547 --> 00:49:57,871
<i>I write. I write novels, stories, things like that.</i>

742
00:49:58,214 --> 00:50:00,333
I'd like to read them. I'll buy some.

743
00:50:00,670 --> 00:50:03,075
<i>Luckily for both you and me,
you'll never manage to.</i>

744
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:04,700
Why not?

745
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:08,708
<i>Because I write under a pseudonym
and I loathe what I write.</i>

746
00:50:09,046 --> 00:50:12,044
Artists always loathe
what they produce, Miss lbbetson.

747
00:50:12,213 --> 00:50:14,167
<i>Yesterday, you called me Claire.</i>

748
00:50:16,211 --> 00:50:19,163
I wasn't aware. I was in a state of alarm.

749
00:50:19,337 --> 00:50:21,707
- Sorry.
- <i>I'd like you to continue.</i>

750
00:50:23,170 --> 00:50:27,165
"I'd like you to continue."
She said it to him, just like that.

751
00:50:27,337 --> 00:50:28,876
Well, what did he say?

752
00:50:29,045 --> 00:50:32,042
He was taken back, but he went
along with what she wanted.

753
00:50:32,378 --> 00:50:33,836
What else could he do?

754
00:50:34,168 --> 00:50:37,250
I would have asked her to do the same,
call me by my first name.

755
00:50:37,419 --> 00:50:38,912
That's not his style.

756
00:50:39,086 --> 00:50:42,037
Besides, I don't think my friend
intends to court her.

757
00:50:42,212 --> 00:50:44,616
Well, then he'll never get her out of there.

758
00:50:44,793 --> 00:50:47,900
<i>Besides, I don't think my friend
intends to court her.</i>

759
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,042
<i>Besides, I don't think my friend
intends to court her.</i>

760
00:50:51,211 --> 00:50:52,408
What a horrible voice!

761
00:50:52,752 --> 00:50:55,999
I'd have thought he'd at least
have desired to see her face.

762
00:50:56,168 --> 00:50:59,000
Desired's probably not the right word.

763
00:50:59,168 --> 00:51:03,079
Curious to see her, perhaps.
Yes, I could understand that.

764
00:51:03,251 --> 00:51:06,333
But the chances of it happening
seem to be really remote.

765
00:51:06,502 --> 00:51:07,829
Well, there might be a way.

766
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,491
Just depends on how brave your friend is.

767
00:51:11,793 --> 00:51:14,200
- The French bureau with the chiming clock.
- <i>Yes.</i>

768
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:17,000
The table inlaid with brass on elm.
The one with the roll top.

768
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:18,322
 <i>No, I'd like to keep that.</i>

769
00:51:18,667 --> 00:51:21,416
Well, that's it.
Next time, we'll do the paintings.

770
00:51:21,751 --> 00:51:23,658
- <i>Okay.</i>
- One last thing, Claire.

771
00:51:23,835 --> 00:51:27,697
You'll have to decide whether we do
the photography here or in a studio.

772
00:51:28,041 --> 00:51:30,992
<i>Better in a studio. I don't want too
many people around the house.</i>

773
00:51:31,333 --> 00:51:34,000
That's the best solution.
Well, I'm off now.

774
00:51:34,166 --> 00:51:37,081
- Anything you need?
- <i>No. Thank you, Mr. Oldman.</i>

775
00:51:38,416 --> 00:51:40,289
<i>When will we next see each other?</i>

776
00:51:41,626 --> 00:51:46,282
You mean, when do you see me,
since I am not given that privilege.

777
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:49,703
- <i>Forgive me.</i>
- But soon.

778
00:51:50,791 --> 00:51:52,947
- Have a good day.
- <i>You too.</i>

779
00:53:29,536 --> 00:53:30,613
<i>Hello?</i>

780
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:59,109
- I can't believe it!
- I couldn't sleep at night, Virgil.

781
00:53:59,284 --> 00:54:02,365
I had to do something
to make you forgive me.

782
00:54:02,534 --> 00:54:04,276
But how did you get it?

783
00:54:04,619 --> 00:54:07,699
I heard that Mrs. Durane
had fallen on hard times.

784
00:54:07,868 --> 00:54:12,572
So I persuaded her to sell it to me
for £250,000.

785
00:54:12,742 --> 00:54:14,947
Not exactly cheap!

786
00:54:15,117 --> 00:54:17,107
I thought it was a reasonable price.

787
00:54:17,450 --> 00:54:19,440
You were talking about 8 million.

788
00:54:19,617 --> 00:54:21,856
This way, everyone gets a good deal.

789
00:54:23,326 --> 00:54:25,113
How much do you want, Billy?

790
00:54:25,282 --> 00:54:27,901
I don't want a penny more
than I gave the old girl.

791
00:54:28,075 --> 00:54:30,112
Now you're really losing your grip.

792
00:54:30,450 --> 00:54:32,606
I just want to get back to where we were.

793
00:54:32,951 --> 00:54:35,699
When I was your friend, your accomplice,

794
00:54:36,032 --> 00:54:38,070
your trusted procurer of women.

795
00:54:39,657 --> 00:54:43,437
lf you're doing all this to win back my trust,
Billy, it's been a bad deal for you.

796
00:54:45,116 --> 00:54:47,153
Because you never lost it in the first place.

798
00:54:50,908 --> 00:54:53,987
This is great! This is great!

799
00:54:54,324 --> 00:54:56,100
You found some really important stuff here.

800
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:58,111
The best bit is this.

801
00:55:00,406 --> 00:55:03,275
- An ear.
- A big step forward, wouldn't you say?

802
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:06,069
I'd say! I'd say we're at a turning point.

803
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:07,483
Now, look.

804
00:55:13,614 --> 00:55:15,450
- Huh?
- Excellent!

805
00:55:15,655 --> 00:55:18,144
The pieces are beginning
to attract each other.

806
00:55:18,323 --> 00:55:19,353
So...

807
00:55:20,698 --> 00:55:23,944
How did things go with your... your friend?

808
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:30,273
How many seconds did it take you
to realise I was talking about myself?

809
00:55:30,446 --> 00:55:32,272
Quite a few, to be honest.

810
00:55:32,446 --> 00:55:35,065
Let me confess, I didn't follow your advice.

811
00:55:36,155 --> 00:55:40,195
There was something too contorted
about it, too imprudent.

812
00:55:40,363 --> 00:55:41,939
Yeah, okay, I see your point.

813
00:56:03,028 --> 00:56:07,104
The mathematical set of a 6-day week.

814
00:56:08,362 --> 00:56:13,351
The mathematical set of a 51-minute hour.

815
00:56:14,737 --> 00:56:16,000
What will you have, sir?

815
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:17,800
- Have you thought of anything else?
- Tea, please.

816
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:23,100
The length of a point.
The direction of a circle.

818
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:24,800
Your tea's ready, sir.

819
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:28,938
The edge of a circumference.
The centre of space.

820
00:56:31,069 --> 00:56:35,394
- The area of a segment.
- Amazing. Well done!

821
00:56:36,528 --> 00:56:39,145
The vertical position of a sphere.

822
00:56:41,069 --> 00:56:43,817
I brought you the valuations
of the furniture and paintings.

823
00:56:43,985 --> 00:56:47,397
Cast your eye over them carefully,
because you'll have to authorise them.

824
00:56:47,568 --> 00:56:51,514
- <i>I don't know a thing about this.</i>
- I know. You'll have to trust me, Miss lbbetson.

825
00:56:51,694 --> 00:56:54,500
<i>I noticed you've been spending
time in the cellars recently.</i>

826
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:58,200
- Is that why you had the locks changed?
- <i>I have them changed them every six months.</i>

827
00:57:01,318 --> 00:57:04,300
And I take care to double-check,
compare and correct,

828
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:07,200
especially when dealing with
discarded odds and ends in cellars.

829
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:09,852
It's how I work. If it upsets you, speak now.

830
00:57:10,234 --> 00:57:13,895
<i>You'll find the new keys on the table.
Please take them.</i>

831
00:57:18,317 --> 00:57:20,438
Thank you for your trust.

832
00:57:20,609 --> 00:57:22,764
<i>Were you offended at being locked out?</i>

833
00:57:22,941 --> 00:57:24,137
No, but I was worried.

834
00:57:25,482 --> 00:57:28,564
<i>You're right, I should have told you. I'm sorry.</i>

835
00:57:30,691 --> 00:57:34,270
Claire, you're ruining your life
for reasons which are beyond me.

836
00:57:34,608 --> 00:57:38,187
This illness of yours is so absurd,
it almost seems unreal.

837
00:57:39,857 --> 00:57:42,475
<i>Even my mother thought
I was faking it the first time.</i>

838
00:57:42,648 --> 00:57:44,022
<i>We were abroad.</i>

839
00:57:44,190 --> 00:57:47,100
<i>I was so afraid of walking
at the foot of the Eiffel Tower</i>

840
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:48,766
<i>that it paralysed me.</i>

841
00:57:48,940 --> 00:57:51,892
<i>I started screaming, fell to the ground.</i>

842
00:57:52,065 --> 00:57:55,265
<i>I was just a little girl, but it kept on
happening more and more often.</i>

843
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:56,980
<i>And she had to believe me.</i>

844
00:57:57,148 --> 00:57:58,900
Has there ever been an open space

845
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,475
where you weren't overcome by anxiety?

846
00:58:01,648 --> 00:58:06,389
<i>Only one. During a school trip
to Prague. I was 14.</i>

847
00:58:06,565 --> 00:58:08,850
<i>The square with the astronomical clock.</i>

848
00:58:09,022 --> 00:58:13,016
<i>I must have walked across it
a hundred times. It was beautiful.</i>

849
00:58:13,356 --> 00:58:16,471
<i>I remember a restaurant
with very strange decor.</i>

850
00:58:17,689 --> 00:58:21,136
<i>If there's one place in the world
I'm nostalgic for, it's that restaurant.</i>

851
00:58:21,314 --> 00:58:22,770
<i>I was really happy there.</i>

852
00:58:24,188 --> 00:58:26,593
<i>It was called "Night and Day".</i>

853
00:58:28,064 --> 00:58:31,014
- You've never been back?
- <i>Never.</i>

854
00:58:32,438 --> 00:58:36,218
Why not go now? I'd be happy to take you.

855
00:58:41,355 --> 00:58:45,347
Well, you don't seem too pleased.
We're almost there.

856
00:58:46,562 --> 00:58:49,763
Our automaton is about
to emerge from the shadows.

857
00:58:49,938 --> 00:58:52,342
No, I'm delighted. You're a force of nature.

858
00:58:54,645 --> 00:58:55,889
It's just that...

859
00:58:57,061 --> 00:59:01,556
this is one of those evenings when
one feels like this contraption here.

861
00:59:07,603 --> 00:59:08,764
Incomplete.

862
00:59:10,019 --> 00:59:13,016
Why did you never marry, never have kids?

863
00:59:13,311 --> 00:59:17,975
The regard I have for women is equal
to the fear I've always had of them.

865
00:59:18,144 --> 00:59:20,633
And to my failure to understand them.

866
00:59:21,768 --> 00:59:26,000
If that's the rule, then Miss lbbetson gives
every impression of being the exception.

868
00:59:27,769 --> 00:59:28,930
I'm afraid so.

869
00:59:29,103 --> 00:59:31,804
Have you really never set eyes on her?

870
00:59:31,975 --> 00:59:33,138
Just once.

871
00:59:34,185 --> 00:59:35,559
What's she like?

872
00:59:35,726 --> 00:59:39,388
I suppose feeling a certain
interest in a person

873
00:59:39,559 --> 00:59:43,139
necessarily engenders
a conviction that she's beautiful.

874
00:59:43,310 --> 00:59:44,968
Up to a point.

875
00:59:46,727 --> 00:59:50,387
It's her birthday in two days.
I'd like to get her something useful.

876
00:59:51,850 --> 00:59:54,802
Yeah. I don't think useful is
probably your best approach.

877
00:59:55,141 --> 00:59:56,700
- You don't?
- Not the first time.

878
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:59,765
It's better to get her something more...
traditional.

879
01:00:04,851 --> 01:00:06,046
- Morning, sir.
- Morning.

880
01:00:08,475 --> 01:00:10,299
Hello, sir.

881
01:00:10,641 --> 01:00:13,509
Hey, Mr. Oldman.
Look what I found in the cellar.

882
01:00:14,766 --> 01:00:17,053
I saw you were interested in this old junk.

883
01:00:18,433 --> 01:00:20,850
Oh, the supports for the
big Murano chandelier.

884
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:22,845
My colleagues couldn't find them.

885
01:00:23,016 --> 01:00:26,215
- If you give me your keys, I'll put them in your car.
- That's very kind.

886
01:00:27,974 --> 01:00:29,217
Wait.

887
01:00:30,974 --> 01:00:32,500
Oh, thanks.

888
01:00:34,433 --> 01:00:35,628
Morning, Mr. Oldman.

889
01:00:37,182 --> 01:00:40,630
I took the liberty of remembering
it's your birthday.

890
01:00:41,099 --> 01:00:42,508
Happy birthday, Claire.

891
01:00:45,223 --> 01:00:48,221
<i>I read the valuation documents.</i>

892
01:00:48,389 --> 01:00:50,629
Did you manage to understand some of it?

893
01:00:50,805 --> 01:00:52,843
<i>Of course! Ridiculous sums of money.</i>

894
01:00:53,014 --> 01:00:55,200
<i>Even a backwards child could
realise she's being cheated!</i>

895
01:00:55,300 --> 01:00:59,300
I did warn you those figures require
interpretation. Those are the starting bids.

896
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:02,263
- There'll be higher bids after that.
- <i>And suppose there aren't?</i>

897
01:01:02,431 --> 01:01:05,000
Unlikely, but in that case,
we'll even things out,

898
01:01:05,100 --> 01:01:07,600
by raising the margins we make
on the more important pieces.

899
01:01:07,700 --> 01:01:10,465
<i>A gamble?! Where I'm
the only one that can lose?</i>

900
01:01:10,638 --> 01:01:12,800
<i>You're trying to cheat me, Mr. Oldman!</i>

901
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:15,512
<i>It's all to your advantage.
You're a fucking thief!</i>

902
01:01:16,681 --> 01:01:19,429
I'm willing to resign the commission forthwith!

903
01:01:20,637 --> 01:01:21,667
<i>Huh!</i>

904
01:01:23,512 --> 01:01:27,257
I'll have them replace all your
mediocre bric-a-brac immediately!

905
01:01:27,430 --> 01:01:31,679
And do me the favour of disappearing
completely from the face of the earth!

907
01:02:16,261 --> 01:02:17,801
1984, sir.

908
01:02:34,801 --> 01:02:37,798
- Hello.
- <i>I behaved so badly.</i>

909
01:02:41,884 --> 01:02:46,174
<i>I feel so stupid.
I constantly have to offer justifications.</i>

910
01:02:48,634 --> 01:02:51,170
<i>I've never been given flowers before.</i>

911
01:02:51,342 --> 01:02:53,500
<i>I don't know what this says of me.</i>

912
01:02:58,050 --> 01:03:01,711
There's no need for this display
of anguish. I'm not angry with you.

913
01:03:05,675 --> 01:03:08,162
<i>My birthdays have always been so horrible.</i>

914
01:03:10,008 --> 01:03:11,714
<i>And you...</i>

915
01:03:11,883 --> 01:03:13,339
<i>Since you came along,</i>

916
01:03:14,549 --> 01:03:17,417
<i>you've turned my life upside down.</i>

917
01:03:20,132 --> 01:03:22,881
<i>The other day, I went downstairs.</i>

918
01:03:24,132 --> 01:03:28,126
<i>I opened the main door
and looked out onto the garden.</i>

919
01:03:29,799 --> 01:03:32,252
- Did you go out?
- <i>No.</i>

920
01:03:34,131 --> 01:03:35,921
<i>I was afraid.</i>

921
01:03:36,089 --> 01:03:37,629
<i>I felt terrible.</i>

922
01:03:39,465 --> 01:03:41,585
<i>But I never even got that far before.</i>

923
01:03:45,631 --> 01:03:47,172
Do you want me to come over?

924
01:03:49,004 --> 01:03:50,711
<i>I already know it's pointless.</i>

925
01:03:50,879 --> 01:03:53,961
There are new treatments nowadays.
They might help you.

926
01:03:54,130 --> 01:03:56,417
<i>I'd rather talk to you than to some shrink.</i>

927
01:03:57,880 --> 01:04:00,795
- Should I take that as a compliment?
- <i>Yes.</i>

928
01:04:04,464 --> 01:04:07,000
I see you've brought up
the portrait of the dancer.

929
01:04:07,100 --> 01:04:09,961
- <i>It's one of the things I want to keep.</i>
- No great value.

930
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:13,080
<i>It's a portrait of my mother.</i>

931
01:04:13,255 --> 01:04:15,458
<i>She was about my age
when she had it done.</i>

932
01:04:19,587 --> 01:04:20,996
Do you look like her?

933
01:04:21,100 --> 01:04:24,667
- <i>She was prettier, I can assure you.</i>
- Regrettably, I cannot judge.

934
01:04:34,212 --> 01:04:35,704
All right, Claire. I'll go.

935
01:04:35,878 --> 01:04:39,150
Don't hesitate to call
if you need anything at all.

936
01:04:39,253 --> 01:04:43,000
<i>Thank you, Mr. Oldman.
See you soon, I hope.</i>

937
01:05:29,292 --> 01:05:32,206
Hello? Oh, it's you, director.

938
01:05:32,584 --> 01:05:35,073
No, I would've called you. It's just that...

939
01:05:35,250 --> 01:05:38,083
clearing out the furniture has been
more complicated than I expected.

940
01:05:39,542 --> 01:05:41,912
Yes. Oldman is dealing with it.

941
01:05:42,792 --> 01:05:46,571
What's he like?
Not as old as you might think.

942
01:05:46,958 --> 01:05:50,702
He dresses in an odd way,
but he's still a good-looking man.

943
01:05:51,083 --> 01:05:53,039
And I know I can trust him.

944
01:05:53,208 --> 01:05:56,539
Why? Are you jealous?

945
01:05:57,167 --> 01:05:59,998
In love? No, I don't think so.

946
01:06:00,207 --> 01:06:03,200
He's too put off by my illness,
like everybody else.

947
01:06:05,123 --> 01:06:07,528
Oh no, it's nothing. I hurt my foot.

948
01:06:07,873 --> 01:06:09,532
Can we talk later?

949
01:06:35,165 --> 01:06:36,408
Who is it?

950
01:06:37,289 --> 01:06:38,829
Who's there?!

951
01:06:39,831 --> 01:06:42,366
No, get out! No, please, get out!

952
01:06:42,789 --> 01:06:45,074
Go away! Get out!

953
01:06:45,455 --> 01:06:48,453
<i>Get out! Please, leave me alone!</i>

954
01:06:50,331 --> 01:06:51,871
<i>Get out!</i>

955
01:06:54,538 --> 01:06:56,078
<i>Get out!</i>

956
01:07:11,246 --> 01:07:15,190
- Hello?
- <i>Please, help me. Please. Please.</i>

957
01:07:15,453 --> 01:07:18,024
- Calm down, Claire. What's happened?
- <i>Please. Please. No, no, no!</i>

958
01:07:18,287 --> 01:07:20,989
<i>You have to help me! Help me! Help me!</i>

959
01:07:21,245 --> 01:07:24,160
- I'll be there as soon as I can.
- <i>Please, Virgil.</i>

960
01:08:19,742 --> 01:08:21,284
Claire!

961
01:08:21,492 --> 01:08:25,439
- It's me. I'm here. What's happened?
- <i>There's somebody in the house!</i>

962
01:08:25,660 --> 01:08:28,691
- <i>Please get them out!</i>
- Calm down, Claire. There's nobody here.

963
01:08:28,866 --> 01:08:31,236
- <i>There's somebody in the house!</i>
- Calm down, Claire.

964
01:08:31,575 --> 01:08:34,608
- <i>Get them out!</i>
- It was me before, Claire. It was me.

965
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:37,741
It was me.

966
01:08:40,492 --> 01:08:43,061
I hid in the room so I could see you.

967
01:08:45,573 --> 01:08:47,031
<i>You were spying on me?</i>

968
01:08:48,157 --> 01:08:50,232
<i>You were spying on me?!</i>

969
01:08:50,824 --> 01:08:52,282
<i>Get out!</i>

970
01:08:52,449 --> 01:08:55,566
<i>I want nothing more to do with you! Get out!</i>

971
01:09:05,770 --> 01:09:08,258
Please, Virgil. Don't go.

972
01:09:26,019 --> 01:09:29,135
Believe me, I don't normally behave like this.

973
01:09:30,728 --> 01:09:32,267
Neither do I.

974
01:09:33,268 --> 01:09:36,386
So I'm bound to make some mistakes.

975
01:09:38,853 --> 01:09:42,382
But nothing in the world would
make me want to hurt you.

976
01:09:43,559 --> 01:09:46,841
It's just that I can't help myself.

977
01:09:49,060 --> 01:09:50,932
I need to see you.

978
01:10:27,475 --> 01:10:29,299
You should've seen her.

979
01:10:30,683 --> 01:10:33,467
Pale, like a Durer etching.

980
01:10:34,016 --> 01:10:37,346
She had the look of some creature
terrified of the universe.

981
01:10:37,682 --> 01:10:40,431
And I could read my own terror in her eyes.

982
01:10:40,766 --> 01:10:45,304
Every man on earth would like to be
as terrified as you at this moment.

983
01:10:53,433 --> 01:10:56,215
- You've worked a miracle.
- Well, it's too soon to tell.

984
01:10:56,598 --> 01:11:00,500
And you be careful, all right?
This is when mistakes occur.

985
01:11:00,598 --> 01:11:02,553
When you think you've made it with a woman,

986
01:11:02,931 --> 01:11:04,900
that is when you lose your grip on strategy.

987
01:11:05,056 --> 01:11:09,003
- And what strategy would that be?
- Never stop surprising them.

988
01:11:09,181 --> 01:11:13,802
Do things that they couldn't have
foreseen. Take a gamble, run a risk.

989
01:11:14,138 --> 01:11:16,971
You're asking me to behave
in a way that just isn't me.

990
01:11:17,305 --> 01:11:19,380
That's precisly why you have to do it.

991
01:11:20,180 --> 01:11:22,929
As long as you're playing
according to her rules,

992
01:11:23,097 --> 01:11:26,297
you're always gonna make her feel like...
like a patient.

993
01:11:26,471 --> 01:11:28,876
She needs to be treated like a woman.

994
01:11:59,636 --> 01:12:01,710
What do you think? Do you like it?

995
01:12:05,554 --> 01:12:07,094
I don't know.

996
01:12:08,386 --> 01:12:09,927
What do you think?

997
01:12:10,927 --> 01:12:12,918
lt looks marvellous on you, Claire.

998
01:12:13,677 --> 01:12:15,300
Perhaps the smaller size.

999
01:12:16,178 --> 01:12:18,797
Yes. I think so too.

1000
01:12:32,509 --> 01:12:35,343
It's been a long time
since I got a present like this.

1001
01:12:36,969 --> 01:12:40,380
- Long overdue, don't you think?
- I don't know.

1002
01:12:40,759 --> 01:12:43,508
I'm a little, you know, taken a back.

1003
01:12:50,551 --> 01:12:52,589
- I'm sorry, I can't...
- What?

1004
01:12:54,508 --> 01:12:55,705
Oh, certainly.

1005
01:12:56,592 --> 01:12:59,507
I'm sorry. I didn't understand.

1006
01:13:08,092 --> 01:13:11,173
I don't honestly know if I deserve all this.

1007
01:13:14,507 --> 01:13:16,962
Let me be the judge of that.

1008
01:13:35,466 --> 01:13:38,050
If we don't set a date
for the auction in Stockholm,

1009
01:13:38,150 --> 01:13:39,791
they'll shoot themselves.

1010
01:13:39,965 --> 01:13:42,700
It's too far. Let them shoot themselves.

1011
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:48,378
Then we have to schedule the meeting
with the director of the Hermitage

1012
01:13:48,715 --> 01:13:51,000
and the auctions in
San Francisco and Madrid.

1013
01:13:51,100 --> 01:13:53,050
Ditto. Too far away.

1014
01:13:53,150 --> 01:13:56,913
- We can't abandon them like this at the last minute.
- There are auctioneers galore in the world.

1015
01:13:57,090 --> 01:14:00,003
They'll find somebody else.
And it will cost them less.

1016
01:14:00,172 --> 01:14:01,451
As you wish, Mr. Oldman.

1017
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:08,960
Lambert, are you married?

1018
01:14:09,880 --> 01:14:12,334
Yes. Nearly 30 years.

1019
01:14:12,671 --> 01:14:15,207
What's it like, living with a woman?

1020
01:14:15,589 --> 01:14:17,462
Like taking part in an auction sale.

1021
01:14:18,129 --> 01:14:21,293
You never know if yours will be the best offer.

1022
01:14:48,087 --> 01:14:49,663
- This one.
- Very well, sir.

1023
01:14:51,420 --> 01:14:54,335
What do you think?
Have I made myself pretty?

1024
01:14:56,127 --> 01:14:58,800
- Beautiful. You've done very well.
- You're a liar.

1025
01:14:58,900 --> 01:15:01,164
- Claire.
- I haven't done this for centuries.

1026
01:15:01,502 --> 01:15:03,200
- I've completely forgotten how to do it.
- Your hand is a bit unsure,

1026
01:15:03,300 --> 01:15:04,501
- I look like a monster.
- but it's not bad.

1027
01:15:04,669 --> 01:15:07,583
Trust me. You need some practice
and you'll be wonderful.

1028
01:15:07,752 --> 01:15:10,206
And you'll take me to one of your auctions,

1029
01:15:10,377 --> 01:15:12,285
and to galas full with elegant people,

1030
01:15:12,627 --> 01:15:16,074
and to the most refined restaurants
in the world.

1031
01:15:16,419 --> 01:15:20,413
That's the reason for your presents,
isn't it, Virgil?

1032
01:15:21,377 --> 01:15:24,623
To help me recover little by little,
and then take me out.

1033
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:26,749
Isn't that right?

1034
01:15:29,169 --> 01:15:30,625
No!

1035
01:15:30,794 --> 01:15:33,033
Claire, don't be like this. Let's talk.

1036
01:15:37,291 --> 01:15:41,535
Maybe we did get the last moves wrong.
I was a bit rash.

1037
01:15:41,917 --> 01:15:43,410
Oh, don't blame yourself.

1038
01:15:43,585 --> 01:15:46,950
It's her who always manages
to pull everything apart.

1039
01:15:47,292 --> 01:15:49,700
Robert, my aunt's gone missing again.

1040
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:51,600
- You're kidding!
- Beg your pardon me.

1041
01:15:51,709 --> 01:15:54,824
- We found her in the Central Park.
- I'm so sorry, Terry.

1042
01:15:54,999 --> 01:15:57,914
It was no good trying to reset this thing.

1043
01:15:58,083 --> 01:16:01,414
It was much more easy
just to make a new one.

1044
01:16:01,583 --> 01:16:04,119
This one has a much wider range.

1045
01:16:04,459 --> 01:16:06,950
She can wander off as much as she likes,
and you'll never lose touch with her.

1046
01:16:07,125 --> 01:16:09,660
Just make sure you reprogram the PC, okay?

1047
01:16:09,832 --> 01:16:11,988
I can manage that. You're an angel.

1048
01:16:12,916 --> 01:16:14,706
- Thanks, darling.
- No worries.

1049
01:16:15,583 --> 01:16:17,100
I'll see you tomorrow night, yeah?

1049
01:16:17,150 --> 01:16:18,400
- Yes.
- Okay.

1050
01:16:20,583 --> 01:16:23,800
What you need is an idea
that's gonna excite her,

1050
01:16:23,850 --> 01:16:25,784
but at the same time
it's gonna reassure her.

1051
01:16:25,998 --> 01:16:30,572
Any idea you like, she's still going to see
through it as some deceitful therapy.

1052
01:16:30,873 --> 01:16:34,250
- You should invite her to dinner.
- Oh, yes! To the Noma in Copenhagen!

1053
01:16:34,300 --> 01:16:37,350
And at the romantic climax
of the evening, by candlelight,

1054
01:16:37,450 --> 01:16:39,743
you tell her she's far more
beautiful than her mother.

1055
01:16:40,081 --> 01:16:42,202
Yes, and after diner you'll come
and have coffee with us.

1056
01:16:42,540 --> 01:16:44,080
If you want to invite me, why not?

1057
01:16:45,997 --> 01:16:50,371
Joking apart, I'd be glad
if you did see her, hear her talk.

1058
01:16:50,748 --> 01:16:53,579
I'm sure you'd understand far more than I.

1059
01:16:55,371 --> 01:16:57,410
Who said anything about joking?

1060
01:16:58,956 --> 01:17:03,164
129,403.

1061
01:17:03,331 --> 01:17:05,037
Your champagne.

1062
01:17:05,150 --> 01:17:06,900
- See if you can cope with this.
- Thank you.

1063
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:14,618
- Thank you, sir.
- 12,624,831.333...

1064
01:17:17,038 --> 01:17:18,580
<i>Unbelievable!</i>

1065
01:17:24,120 --> 01:17:25,695
You're radiant, Claire.

1066
01:17:27,745 --> 01:17:29,155
You did all this?

1067
01:17:29,329 --> 01:17:32,200
I can turn my hand to interior decorating.

1068
01:17:40,993 --> 01:17:44,490
You've done a wonderful job, Virgil.
Thank you.

1069
01:17:50,493 --> 01:17:54,025
I can't tell you how long I've been wanting
to spend time alone with you.

1070
01:17:54,369 --> 01:17:57,865
Somewhere quiet,
far from the madding crowd.

1071
01:18:03,285 --> 01:18:05,359
To your serenity, Claire.

1072
01:18:07,952 --> 01:18:09,800
To your irony, Virgil.

1073
01:18:15,702 --> 01:18:18,300
- And now I feel I can finally tell you.
- What?

1074
01:18:18,410 --> 01:18:20,944
You are more beautiful than the dancer.

1075
01:18:23,659 --> 01:18:25,152
Dinner is served.

1076
01:18:25,534 --> 01:18:28,024
- Please be seated.
- Thank you.

1077
01:18:28,367 --> 01:18:31,000
But I warn you, as a waiter
I'm not of the highest class.

1078
01:18:31,100 --> 01:18:33,447
I offer no guarantees.

1079
01:18:34,160 --> 01:18:37,276
- I'll take the risk.
- Somewhat foolhardy of you.

1080
01:18:37,909 --> 01:18:40,942
- Why? - Because if the service
were not to be to your liking,

1081
01:18:41,116 --> 01:18:45,200
next time I would be obliged to make a
reservation at the finest restaurant in town.

1083
01:18:47,742 --> 01:18:49,862
Let's not ruin this evening, Virgil.

1084
01:18:50,033 --> 01:18:53,481
- Please, let's not talk about me.
- All right.

1085
01:18:53,826 --> 01:18:56,700
Instead I'd like you to tell me
about you, about your past.

1086
01:18:56,866 --> 01:19:00,065
You see, Claire, there's nothing
very original about my life.

1087
01:19:00,408 --> 01:19:03,525
A child loses his parents,
a horrible orphanage, that sort of thing.

1088
01:19:03,866 --> 01:19:07,300
The only point of interest is
that the nuns would punish the boy

1089
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:10,862
by forcing him to work with a restorer,
who had a workshop in the institution.

1090
01:19:11,199 --> 01:19:12,941
That's beautiful.

1091
01:19:13,115 --> 01:19:15,320
And since he loved to
observe this craftsman,

1092
01:19:15,657 --> 01:19:19,350
the little boy started to get up
to all sorts of mischief to ensure

1093
01:19:19,450 --> 01:19:22,100
that he would be punished
as frequently as possible.

1094
01:19:22,200 --> 01:19:24,399
So he became acquainted with works of art,

1095
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:26,400
the various techniques of painting,

1095
01:19:26,500 --> 01:19:28,520
how to tell a forgery from an original,

1096
01:19:28,699 --> 01:19:30,488
etc, etc.

1097
01:19:30,656 --> 01:19:35,645
You know, in an old article of yours I found
the other day on the internet, you said,

1098
01:19:35,988 --> 01:19:39,236
"There's always something authentic
concealed in every forgery."

1099
01:19:39,573 --> 01:19:40,982
What did you mean by that?

1100
01:19:41,155 --> 01:19:43,100
That in simulating another person's work,

1101
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:47,525
the forger cannot resist the temptation
to put in something of himself.

1102
01:19:47,698 --> 01:19:50,812
Often it's just a trifle, a detail of no interest.

1103
01:19:51,154 --> 01:19:52,800
One unsuspected brush-stroke,

1104
01:19:52,905 --> 01:19:56,152
by which the forger inevitably
ends up betraying himself,

1105
01:19:56,488 --> 01:19:59,771
and revealing his own,
utterly authentic sensibilities.

1106
01:20:00,738 --> 01:20:02,978
I really love the way you talk.

1107
01:20:03,321 --> 01:20:05,691
You couldn't have been more convincing.

1108
01:20:05,862 --> 01:20:07,653
Huh? A born seducer.

1109
01:20:07,987 --> 01:20:12,028
- So you'd give me a pass?
- A+. With distinction!

1110
01:20:12,362 --> 01:20:14,981
Sorry, you've been a bit neglected lately.

1111
01:20:16,779 --> 01:20:19,397
You haven't said anything about Claire.

1112
01:20:20,196 --> 01:20:23,857
If I didn't know about her problems,
I'd say she was a completely normal woman.

1113
01:20:24,237 --> 01:20:27,568
And she's much more beautiful
than you described.

1114
01:20:27,903 --> 01:20:30,300
Really, I liked her.

1115
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:32,400
So, now, you're going to make me jealous?

1116
01:20:32,500 --> 01:20:35,900
lf you want my advice, Virgil,
you pray that girl never gets better.

1117
01:20:36,236 --> 01:20:38,807
Mr/ Oldman, do you want lots
87 and 88 done separately?

1118
01:20:38,986 --> 01:20:41,357
No, together. Always together.
That's important.

1119
01:20:47,818 --> 01:20:49,725
How can I help you?

1120
01:20:51,444 --> 01:20:53,849
- It's about Robert.
- What's going on?

1121
01:20:55,860 --> 01:20:57,234
Don't be afraid to tell me.

1122
01:20:59,360 --> 01:21:02,194
We're not getting on so well,
that's the problem.

1123
01:21:02,526 --> 01:21:04,895
All those girls hovering around him.

1124
01:21:06,150 --> 01:21:07,692
I guess I'm just...

1125
01:21:08,276 --> 01:21:09,899
l'm afraid of losing him.

1126
01:21:10,984 --> 01:21:12,856
Is there anything I can do?

1127
01:21:14,194 --> 01:21:15,734
Do you want me to talk to him?

1128
01:21:17,859 --> 01:21:21,983
For a while now he's been talking
about someone called Claire.

1129
01:21:24,442 --> 01:21:25,983
Claire?

1130
01:21:26,942 --> 01:21:28,814
I don't understand.

1131
01:21:28,984 --> 01:21:33,392
With him, everybody's got to
be on their guard, all the time.

1132
01:21:33,732 --> 01:21:35,475
That goes for you, too.

1133
01:21:38,401 --> 01:21:40,273
I feel so stupid.

1134
01:21:43,567 --> 01:21:45,936
Promise me you won't say a word to him.

1135
01:21:47,024 --> 01:21:48,682
I promise.

1136
01:21:53,817 --> 01:21:56,387
Have you been waiting there long?

1137
01:21:56,567 --> 01:21:59,316
lf you'd 've phoned,
I wouldn't have kept you waiting.

1138
01:21:59,483 --> 01:22:02,300
- I prefer to speak to you in person.
- Why, is something wrong?

1139
01:22:02,481 --> 01:22:04,389
One of my assistants will come by today.

1140
01:22:04,565 --> 01:22:07,563
Kindly hand over the Vaucanson as it is.

1141
01:22:07,732 --> 01:22:09,805
All right. Whatever you want.

1142
01:22:10,149 --> 01:22:12,800
Tell him how much you're owed for
your work. He'll pay you on the spot.

1143
01:22:14,649 --> 01:22:16,686
I think I'm at least due an explanation,
aren't I?

1144
01:22:16,856 --> 01:22:19,806
You're not the trustworthy, discreet man
I thought you were.

1145
01:22:21,814 --> 01:22:25,180
lt's weird seeing them all
so perfect and polished up.

1146
01:22:25,523 --> 01:22:26,979
It's as if they weren't mine.

1147
01:22:38,189 --> 01:22:40,226
I believe nothing is missing.

1148
01:22:41,396 --> 01:22:43,020
There is something missing.

1149
01:23:03,562 --> 01:23:07,721
How could you have lived the best
years of your life in here, my darling?

1150
01:23:08,478 --> 01:23:11,596
I don't know. I don't know.

1151
01:23:12,313 --> 01:23:13,852
It was just the right thing.

1152
01:23:17,395 --> 01:23:18,887
"Was".

1153
01:23:20,687 --> 01:23:22,227
lt still is.

1154
01:23:22,562 --> 01:23:24,102
It always will be.

1155
01:23:24,853 --> 01:23:26,394
Always.

1156
01:23:33,436 --> 01:23:37,133
You have to get out of here
and you have to do it by yourself.

1157
01:23:38,144 --> 01:23:40,016
I don't have the courage.

1158
01:23:42,186 --> 01:23:45,432
It's a spider's web that
I'll never know how to break free of.

1159
01:23:49,894 --> 01:23:52,298
It's an old collection
my father was very fond of.

1160
01:23:52,643 --> 01:23:54,764
I never did understand what it was.

1161
01:24:01,935 --> 01:24:04,636
Hello? Good morning, director.

1162
01:24:05,726 --> 01:24:07,598
Yes, I'm nearly finished.

1163
01:24:08,351 --> 01:24:10,839
But I would like to rewrite the last chapter.

1164
01:24:11,517 --> 01:24:13,592
A more upbeat ending.

1165
01:24:15,684 --> 01:24:17,556
If that's all you want.

1166
01:24:18,392 --> 01:24:21,307
Yes. Talk to you soon. Thanks.

1167
01:24:23,642 --> 01:24:27,008
I wouldn't rule out them being
part of something of some value,

1168
01:24:27,184 --> 01:24:29,221
but exactly what I wouldn't be able to say.

1169
01:24:29,557 --> 01:24:32,000
- I often wonder if...
- What?

1170
01:24:32,100 --> 01:24:35,264
lf you're more interested in my
furniture and paintings than in me.

1171
01:24:37,016 --> 01:24:39,090
How could you say that?

1172
01:24:40,933 --> 01:24:43,847
I shouldn't have let you in here.
I shouldn't have.

1173
01:25:07,389 --> 01:25:09,843
I've found all the missing pieces.

1174
01:25:10,139 --> 01:25:12,426
How do you feel about finishing the job?

1175
01:25:13,306 --> 01:25:15,213
Well, it's your problem.

1176
01:25:17,389 --> 01:25:19,427
Sarah came to see me a few days ago.

1177
01:25:19,598 --> 01:25:21,837
She seemed very upset
about your relationship.

1178
01:25:25,306 --> 01:25:27,000
You are here to advise me now, are you?

1178
01:25:27,100 --> 01:25:29,713
I wouldn't dare. When it comes
to women, you're the expert.

1179
01:25:31,055 --> 01:25:33,721
All right. We can pick up
where we left off, if you like.

1180
01:25:34,055 --> 01:25:35,100
But on two conditions.

1181
01:25:35,200 --> 01:25:39,400
And the first is that you just stop
involving me in your private life.

1182
01:25:40,472 --> 01:25:41,550
And the second?

1183
01:25:47,387 --> 01:25:48,844
Is that you take this back.

1184
01:25:54,263 --> 01:25:57,878
I didn't get excited about
your Vaucanson for the money.

1185
01:26:01,345 --> 01:26:03,253
I brought it back. It's in the car.

1186
01:26:03,595 --> 01:26:05,419
And the new pieces too?

1187
01:26:05,762 --> 01:26:09,950
You'll have to be patient a bit longer for those.
They're tied up with my private life.

1188
01:26:10,179 --> 01:26:13,010
I don't know and I don't want to know.

1189
01:26:14,387 --> 01:26:18,510
If you were forced to choose between
Claire and the automaton, today,

1190
01:26:18,843 --> 01:26:20,752
which would you take?

1191
01:26:28,135 --> 01:26:31,501
- This one.
- An excellent choice, Mr. Oldman.

1192
01:26:31,844 --> 01:26:33,171
If it's not the right size,

1193
01:26:33,344 --> 01:26:36,461
please inform the lady to pass by
whenever she wishes.

1194
01:26:36,636 --> 01:26:38,341
Thank you, I'll let her know.

1195
01:26:38,677 --> 01:26:40,383
Claire, it's me.

1196
01:26:57,517 --> 01:27:00,457
Claire, I've brought lunch.

1197
01:27:10,092 --> 01:27:11,633
Claire!

1198
01:27:16,458 --> 01:27:18,081
Claire, answer me!

1199
01:27:19,800 --> 01:27:21,340
Claire!

1200
01:27:23,051 --> 01:27:24,590
Claire!

1201
01:27:26,626 --> 01:27:27,965
Claire!

1202
01:27:33,590 --> 01:27:35,166
Are you down here?

1203
01:27:40,674 --> 01:27:43,376
Claire!

1204
01:28:19,089 --> 01:28:21,200
Excuse me, but have anyone
of you seen a woman

1205
01:28:21,250 --> 01:28:24,170
going out the gate of the villa
across the road?

1206
01:28:24,339 --> 01:28:25,900
No, I can't say I have.

1207
01:28:26,130 --> 01:28:29,162
Has anybody seen someone
coming out of the villa?

1208
01:28:29,504 --> 01:28:32,254
A young woman. Medium height, light hair.

1209
01:28:32,587 --> 01:28:35,076
- A bit pale.
- I think I saw her.

1210
01:28:35,421 --> 01:28:36,800
- Yes.
- I didn't actually see her go out,

1211
01:28:36,900 --> 01:28:39,084
but she was walking away from the gate.

1212
01:28:39,422 --> 01:28:41,707
- When?
- This morning I was having breakfast.

1213
01:28:42,046 --> 01:28:45,209
- What else can you tell me?
- I don't know what to say. She seemed a bit weird.

1214
01:28:45,546 --> 01:28:49,870
- Weird? Which way did she go?
- That way. Towards the park.

1215
01:28:50,212 --> 01:28:51,954
231.

1216
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:55,200
Idiot!

1217
01:28:57,711 --> 01:29:00,100
<i>Hello? Helo, Virgil?</i>

1218
01:29:00,200 --> 01:29:01,200
- She's gone.
- <i>Who? What's going on?</i>

1218
01:29:01,300 --> 01:29:03,100
- Claire, she's disappeared.
- <i>You're kidding!</i>

1219
01:29:03,200 --> 01:29:05,900
I've looked everywhere.
They saw her leave this morning.

1220
01:29:06,086 --> 01:29:08,409
- <i>Okay, listen. Do you want me to come over?</i>
- Please.

1221
01:29:11,294 --> 01:29:12,835
Has this ever happened before?

1222
01:29:13,002 --> 01:29:15,500
I tell you, she never even appeared
at the windows.

1223
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:16,950
Just behind the shutters.

1224
01:29:17,210 --> 01:29:19,450
Did she have friends,
people she could've gone to?

1225
01:29:19,795 --> 01:29:23,000
She always used to sit at the computer
communicating with somebody,

1225
01:29:23,100 --> 01:29:24,200
but under different names.

1226
01:29:24,400 --> 01:29:27,998
- If she's gone out, she can't have gone far.
- Let's hope so.

1227
01:29:28,334 --> 01:29:30,372
I've already been round three times.

1228
01:29:33,001 --> 01:29:34,792
- Hello?
- <i>Mr. Oldman.</i>

1229
01:29:34,960 --> 01:29:37,745
- Oh, listen, Lambert, has Miss lbbetson phoned?
- <i>No.</i>

1230
01:29:37,919 --> 01:29:40,620
- lf she calls, let me know immediately.
- <i>I will.</i>

1231
01:29:40,794 --> 01:29:44,573
<i>Mr. Oldman, I wouldn't like
to think you'd forgotten.</i>

1232
01:29:44,750 --> 01:29:46,623
Forgotten what?

1232
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:52,600
<i>It's over an hour!</i>

1233
01:29:54,043 --> 01:29:57,455
- <i>There he is. Here we go.</i>
- Lot number 1.

1234
01:29:57,792 --> 01:30:01,831
Late Baroque, Venetian,
mid-18th-century mirror.

1235
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,121
Inlaid wood with gold leaf,

1236
01:30:04,458 --> 01:30:08,456
carved with adornments,
floral motifs and festoons.

1237
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:11,206
Upper frame richly...

1238
01:30:19,457 --> 01:30:22,206
Inlaid wood with gold leaf,
carved with adornments,

1239
01:30:22,374 --> 01:30:24,000
floral motifs and festoons.

1240
01:30:24,100 --> 01:30:26,300
Upper frame richly engraved with whirls.

1241
01:30:26,400 --> 01:30:28,290
Can we say €130,000?

1242
01:30:29,416 --> 01:30:30,992
€140,000.

1243
01:30:31,332 --> 01:30:33,500
150,000, gentleman on my left.

1244
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:35,870
160,000, lady up the back.

1245
01:30:36,249 --> 01:30:38,000
170,000.

1245
01:30:38,300 --> 01:30:40,372
180,000 on the telephone.

1246
01:30:40,706 --> 01:30:44,286
200,000, gentleman on my left in the room.

1247
01:30:44,456 --> 01:30:46,661
220,000.

1248
01:30:46,831 --> 01:30:49,948
250,000 on the teleph...

1249
01:30:50,290 --> 01:30:53,323
<i>Still nothing, Mr. Oldman.
I'll keep looking here.</i>

1250
01:30:53,499 --> 01:30:56,116
- <i>Robert's looking further afield.</i>
- All right.

1251
01:30:56,289 --> 01:30:59,073
- <i>I'll call you later.</i>
- All right.

1252
01:31:01,455 --> 01:31:04,158
- <i>He's gone crazy.</i>
- 280,000.

1253
01:31:04,497 --> 01:31:06,618
€310,000. Any more?

1254
01:31:07,497 --> 01:31:09,000
Sold!

1255
01:31:11,400 --> 01:31:14,200
<i>Virgil, listen, I'm doing the rounds of
the hospitals, but there's nothing here.</i>

1256
01:31:14,300 --> 01:31:15,360
Just keep looking.

1257
01:31:15,539 --> 01:31:18,156
- <i>We'll find her. I'll keep in touch.</i>
- Thanks, Robert.

1258
01:31:19,205 --> 01:31:20,780
Lot number 2.

1259
01:31:20,955 --> 01:31:23,869
The extraordinary 17th-century
Fassadenschranke wardrobe

1260
01:31:24,037 --> 01:31:25,863
in walnut, maple, oak and ash.

1261
01:31:26,038 --> 01:31:28,705
The carved frame surmounts an inlaid stripe,

1262
01:31:29,038 --> 01:31:32,320
and two doors engraved
with architectural motifs,

1263
01:31:32,663 --> 01:31:34,652
surrounded by carvings of fruit and masks.

1264
01:31:34,996 --> 01:31:38,400
Three spiralled, tapered columns
flank the doors.

1265
01:31:38,500 --> 01:31:41,487
The lower body has two drawers.

1267
01:31:50,245 --> 01:31:53,361
There's nothing for it but to call the police.

1268
01:31:53,536 --> 01:31:56,404
It'll be all over the papers.
They'll drag me into it.

1269
01:31:56,577 --> 01:31:58,036
Let's wait a bit longer.

1270
01:31:58,369 --> 01:31:59,946
What do you hope's gonna happen?

1271
01:32:00,287 --> 01:32:03,616
That she'll come back or turn up.

1272
01:32:04,953 --> 01:32:07,620
Or they'll find out where she is.

1273
01:32:07,787 --> 01:32:11,530
Someone with her problems
doesn't just disappear into thin air.

1274
01:32:11,702 --> 01:32:13,775
Well, that depends.

1275
01:32:14,118 --> 01:32:15,991
It doesn't matter how deeply rooted it is,

1276
01:32:16,160 --> 01:32:18,944
sometimes a phobia can
just disappear by itself.

1277
01:32:19,286 --> 01:32:21,300
So, why did she run away?

1278
01:32:21,400 --> 01:32:23,300
Maybe something happened
between you two.

1279
01:32:23,576 --> 01:32:26,147
And that drove her to take
that kind of decision.

1280
01:32:26,326 --> 01:32:29,609
You know perfectly well that's impossible.

1281
01:32:29,785 --> 01:32:32,617
You're the only person in the whole world
who knows everything

1282
01:32:32,785 --> 01:32:34,490
that happened between us.

1283
01:32:38,034 --> 01:32:40,000
Excuse me a minute.

1284
01:32:59,950 --> 01:33:02,740
- Hello?
- <i>I'm sorry, Mr. Oldman.</i>

1285
01:33:02,909 --> 01:33:05,313
<i>I've called all the publishers in existence,</i>

1286
01:33:05,491 --> 01:33:07,528
<i>but not one of them knows who she is.</i>

1287
01:33:07,698 --> 01:33:13,000
<i>They all said that often even they don't know
the identity of authors who use pseudonyms.</i>

1289
01:33:13,300 --> 01:33:15,772
I would never have guessed that you

1290
01:33:15,949 --> 01:33:18,403
would have ended up in a mess like this.

1291
01:33:18,574 --> 01:33:22,354
- I don't even know how I can help you.
- All you had to do was listen.

1293
01:33:25,032 --> 01:33:29,488
Considering the lady's illness,
it seems highly unrealistic

1294
01:33:29,823 --> 01:33:31,648
that she's just run away.

1295
01:33:32,948 --> 01:33:38,000
I'd say, I don't know, she'd been
abducted or something like that.

1296
01:33:38,100 --> 01:33:40,900
That's not likely.
I don't think she had any enemies.

1297
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:44,313
It could be somebody became
so besotted with her

1298
01:33:44,489 --> 01:33:46,066
that he carried her off by force.

1299
01:33:46,406 --> 01:33:49,950
- But who?
- I've had my doubts lately about Robert.

1300
01:33:50,156 --> 01:33:51,186
The young guy?

1301
01:33:52,530 --> 01:33:54,800
The way you describe him,
he doesn't seem the type.

1302
01:33:54,900 --> 01:33:58,028
From the literary point of view, he fits the bill.

1303
01:33:59,156 --> 01:34:01,192
The young knight rescuing the damsel

1304
01:34:01,364 --> 01:34:04,811
from the clutches of the old man
incapable of love.

1305
01:34:05,156 --> 01:34:07,904
Literature, exactly.

1306
01:34:08,237 --> 01:34:10,228
Don't go overboard, Virgil.

1307
01:34:10,571 --> 01:34:13,854
She could have had her own reasons
for disappearing.

1308
01:34:14,196 --> 01:34:16,685
I can't imagine what reasons.

1309
01:34:17,031 --> 01:34:20,400
Recently, she's been experiencing
emotions and feelings

1310
01:34:20,500 --> 01:34:22,690
that are incompatible with flight.

1311
01:34:23,028 --> 01:34:25,019
I wouldn't be so sure, if I were you.

1312
01:34:25,362 --> 01:34:27,851
Human emotions are like works of art.

1313
01:34:28,195 --> 01:34:29,902
They can be forged.

1314
01:34:30,071 --> 01:34:35,400
They seem just like the original,
but they're a forgery.

1315
01:34:36,529 --> 01:34:40,474
- Forgery?
- Everything can be faked, Virgil.

1316
01:34:40,819 --> 01:34:43,770
Joy, pain, hate.

1317
01:34:45,319 --> 01:34:47,774
Illness, recovery.

1318
01:34:49,319 --> 01:34:51,393
Even love.

1319
01:35:09,235 --> 01:35:10,977
- Hello?
- <i>Listen, Virgil.</i>

1320
01:35:11,152 --> 01:35:13,688
<i>There's something that hadn't occurred to us.</i>

1321
01:35:13,860 --> 01:35:17,900
<i>Are you sure there are
no other secret rooms in the villa?</i>

1322
01:35:18,068 --> 01:35:22,300
I don't remember of being any other doors
like the one to Miss lbbetson's room.

1324
01:35:23,984 --> 01:35:26,000
Claire!

1325
01:35:26,401 --> 01:35:31,106
The only place we haven't looked at
is the attic. If you want.

1326
01:35:37,066 --> 01:35:39,900
Did you know that Miss Claire was a writer?

1327
01:35:40,066 --> 01:35:42,638
I heard her parents talk about it.

1328
01:35:42,816 --> 01:35:45,850
She used a pseudonym for her books.

1329
01:35:46,026 --> 01:35:49,935
I never knew that. To tell you the truth,
I've never seen the books.

1330
01:35:50,275 --> 01:35:52,300
I don't think she ever wanted them
around the house.

1331
01:35:52,400 --> 01:35:53,731
Claire!

1332
01:35:55,025 --> 01:35:58,400
We're just wasting time.
There are no other secret rooms.

1333
01:35:58,500 --> 01:36:00,059
<i>You've come back.</i>

1334
01:36:00,233 --> 01:36:02,058
- We should--
- Quiet!

1335
01:36:02,400 --> 01:36:03,727
<i>You've...</i>

1336
01:36:04,899 --> 01:36:06,309
<i>You've come back.</i>

1337
01:36:06,482 --> 01:36:08,355
<i>You've...</i>

1338
01:36:10,398 --> 01:36:12,224
<i>You've come back.</i>

1339
01:36:12,564 --> 01:36:13,938
<i>You've...</i>

1340
01:36:14,107 --> 01:36:15,765
Claire?

1341
01:36:21,107 --> 01:36:24,804
Claire, I can feel you're there. Answer me.

1342
01:36:27,274 --> 01:36:28,765
<i>You've come back.</i>

1343
01:36:31,606 --> 01:36:34,686
- <i>You've come back.</i>
- Of course I have.

1344
01:36:36,023 --> 01:36:37,681
Were you afraid I wouldn't?

1345
01:36:49,646 --> 01:36:52,400
I thought you'd abandoned me.

1346
01:36:52,771 --> 01:36:56,268
- Like last time.
- Last time?

1347
01:36:56,905 --> 01:36:59,437
When we got back from Prague.

1348
01:37:02,606 --> 01:37:03,931
Claire.

1349
01:37:25,853 --> 01:37:27,950
I will never abandon you.

1350
01:37:31,478 --> 01:37:35,008
I'd been happy in Prague
in that very odd restaurant.

1351
01:37:37,686 --> 01:37:40,601
I was there with my first and only boyfriend.

1352
01:37:42,769 --> 01:37:44,392
He was older than me.

1353
01:37:49,269 --> 01:37:51,971
When we got back from that excursion,

1354
01:37:52,144 --> 01:37:55,058
one afternoon, we were walking
in the city centre.

1355
01:37:57,895 --> 01:37:59,968
A car crashed into us.

1356
01:38:01,144 --> 01:38:04,888
When I came to, he wasn't there anymore.

1357
01:38:26,392 --> 01:38:30,766
I went back home and I never went out again.

1358
01:38:59,141 --> 01:39:01,297
I've never slept with a woman.

1359
01:39:01,641 --> 01:39:04,638
In fact, I didn't close my eyes.

1360
01:39:04,973 --> 01:39:08,470
I spent the whole night just looking at her.

1361
01:39:08,807 --> 01:39:10,149
It was wonderful.

1361
01:39:11,600 --> 01:39:13,049
Well, welcome to the grown-up club.

1362
01:39:13,391 --> 01:39:16,174
You've succeeded in making her fall in love.

1363
01:39:17,889 --> 01:39:19,761
I had a good teacher.

1364
01:39:22,264 --> 01:39:24,420
Finally, I understood where the dwarf hid.

1365
01:39:24,765 --> 01:39:27,632
Look, there must have been
a sunken pedestal here.

1366
01:39:27,973 --> 01:39:29,600
The little man would crouch in there

1367
01:39:29,650 --> 01:39:32,169
and his voice would reverberate
inside the body.

1368
01:39:32,347 --> 01:39:34,137
It must have made a deep impression.

1369
01:39:34,471 --> 01:39:36,700
Robert, do you think it's possible
that love can be faked?

1370
01:39:41,347 --> 01:39:44,400
Well, in keeping with what you say
about art forgeries,

1371
01:39:44,500 --> 01:39:46,836
I'd just say it can't be completely faked.

1372
01:39:47,179 --> 01:39:49,500
If one could say love is a work of art.

1373
01:39:49,700 --> 01:39:52,043
It'd be amazing if it were, wouldn't it?

1374
01:39:52,221 --> 01:39:54,300
lt could be sold off at an auction.

1375
01:39:54,429 --> 01:39:58,091
The highest bidder could relive
the greatest love stories in history.

1376
01:39:58,263 --> 01:40:00,900
I hope I haven't destroyed
your love story with Sarah.

1377
01:40:01,096 --> 01:40:03,002
Oh, no problem. No problem.

1378
01:40:03,346 --> 01:40:05,751
A new valve, two hinges, one fuse...

1379
01:40:05,928 --> 01:40:08,500
It'll be good as new.
Just like on the first day.

1380
01:40:09,400 --> 01:40:11,043
What do you think you're going to do now?

1381
01:40:13,012 --> 01:40:15,335
I want to coax her out.

1382
01:40:15,800 --> 01:40:19,542
Yeah, I wouldn't push too hard if I were you.

1383
01:40:19,887 --> 01:40:21,961
She's too fragile.

1384
01:40:22,303 --> 01:40:26,676
You'll see. When you least expect it,
things will just fall into place quite naturally.

1385
01:40:41,844 --> 01:40:42,900
No!

1386
01:41:34,050 --> 01:41:37,210
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

1387
01:41:38,383 --> 01:41:41,216
<i>Virgil? Virgil, is that you?</i>

1388
01:42:13,590 --> 01:42:16,256
Virgil! Virgil!

1389
01:42:22,421 --> 01:42:24,000
Virgil?

1390
01:42:44,962 --> 01:42:46,950
Help! Help!

1391
01:42:48,087 --> 01:42:50,300
- Hold it up!
- It is up!

1392
01:43:19,878 --> 01:43:22,627
Why do you say don't you love it?

1393
01:43:22,794 --> 01:43:26,624
I've never felt it to be a real home.
More like a hotel.

1394
01:43:26,961 --> 01:43:29,050
You come home a night, sleep if you can.

1395
01:43:29,150 --> 01:43:31,623
Next morning, you're off somewhere else.

1396
01:43:32,960 --> 01:43:35,034
Let's go back inside.

1397
01:43:36,418 --> 01:43:40,199
Seems to have been planned
to welcome a lot of people.

1398
01:43:40,377 --> 01:43:43,741
Yes, but the plan was never realised.

1399
01:43:43,918 --> 01:43:46,585
Except for the inaugural reception.

1400
01:43:46,918 --> 01:43:48,874
I was so distrustful of other people

1401
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:53,747
that I kept them strictly away from
the perimeter of my personal hotel.

1402
01:43:56,042 --> 01:43:57,913
I was a fool.

1403
01:43:59,376 --> 01:44:00,952
Even now, I still get upset

1404
01:44:01,126 --> 01:44:04,408
when I see the housekeeper
and the maids walking about.

1405
01:44:04,584 --> 01:44:06,658
After dinner, I send them home.

1406
01:44:08,210 --> 01:44:10,744
I wasn't wrong when I said
we were very similar.

1407
01:44:10,916 --> 01:44:12,658
Yes, you were right.

1408
01:44:14,332 --> 01:44:16,407
And thanks to you, I understood.

1409
01:44:34,624 --> 01:44:37,242
- Where are you taking me?
- You'll soon find out.

1410
01:44:39,458 --> 01:44:43,367
Close your eyes.
I'll tell you when you can open them.

1411
01:44:51,957 --> 01:44:54,705
Don't be afraid. I'll lead the way.

1412
01:44:54,874 --> 01:44:58,155
I never liked games where
you had to close your eyes.

1413
01:45:05,456 --> 01:45:08,986
- Mind the step.
- Gently, please.

1414
01:45:13,205 --> 01:45:14,800
We're almost there.

1415
01:45:16,080 --> 01:45:17,489
Stop now.

1416
01:45:19,789 --> 01:45:21,495
Open your eyes.

1417
01:45:29,329 --> 01:45:31,035
I don't believe it.

1418
01:45:34,537 --> 01:45:36,030
It's overwhelming.

1419
01:45:36,662 --> 01:45:38,986
I've been collecting them all my life.

1420
01:45:40,997 --> 01:45:44,076
So, I'm not the first.
You have had other women

1421
01:45:44,411 --> 01:45:46,781
Yes.

1422
01:45:46,953 --> 01:45:49,525
I've loved them all and they loved me back.

1423
01:45:49,871 --> 01:45:51,992
They taught me to wait for you.

1424
01:45:53,829 --> 01:45:55,654
And now that you're here,

1425
01:45:55,829 --> 01:45:58,032
we'd like you to come and live with us

1426
01:45:58,203 --> 01:46:00,657
and make this beautiful hotel your home.

1427
01:46:02,203 --> 01:46:03,743
Oh, Virgil.

1428
01:46:06,411 --> 01:46:08,900
If anything should ever happen to us,

1429
01:46:09,078 --> 01:46:11,151
I want you to know that I do love you.

1430
01:46:13,369 --> 01:46:14,992
I love you too.

1431
01:46:15,160 --> 01:46:18,750
The catalogue for the auction sale
of the paintings and furniture

1432
01:46:18,800 --> 01:46:20,486
of Ibbetson Villa is ready.

1433
01:46:20,660 --> 01:46:24,108
- Congratulations, Virgil. This is a lovely volume.
- About time!

1434
01:46:25,784 --> 01:46:28,818
I wonder who's gonna buy
this wonderful stuff. Oh, sorry.

1435
01:46:28,994 --> 01:46:32,323
I can't conceal my anxiety to know
what you think about it.

1436
01:46:43,159 --> 01:46:44,700
Don't you like it?

1437
01:46:47,409 --> 01:46:48,783
No, it's just that...

1438
01:46:50,784 --> 01:46:53,569
...ever since I decided
to come and live with you...

1439
01:46:55,160 --> 01:46:58,855
I've been thinking I don't want
to sell anymore.

1440
01:47:01,242 --> 01:47:03,612
I'd like to leave everything the way it was.

1441
01:47:10,450 --> 01:47:11,527
I understand.

1442
01:47:12,575 --> 01:47:13,700
Are you sure?

1443
01:47:14,449 --> 01:47:16,984
Believe me, if I were you,
I'd do the same thing.

1444
01:47:19,157 --> 01:47:22,523
Tomorrow, everything
will be back in its place.

1445
01:47:25,573 --> 01:47:26,950
All right, Virgil, yes!

1446
01:47:31,449 --> 01:47:35,607
To the most tortured and most
fortunate catalogue of my career.

1447
01:47:35,782 --> 01:47:37,441
That's saying something.

1448
01:47:37,615 --> 01:47:39,652
- Here, here.
- Cheers.

1449
01:47:41,240 --> 01:47:43,645
And since you've become my family,

1450
01:47:45,531 --> 01:47:48,233
I too have an important
announcement to make.

1451
01:47:49,074 --> 01:47:51,300
Next week, I have an auction in London.

1452
01:47:51,400 --> 01:47:54,979
It will be the finest of my career
and the very last.

1453
01:48:00,697 --> 01:48:03,529
They say he's been seen
recently in female company.

1454
01:48:03,697 --> 01:48:05,439
- No! - Who? Virgil? - Yes.

1455
01:48:05,615 --> 01:48:09,738
It's finally come home to him that the
worst sexual perversion is chastity.

1456
01:48:10,947 --> 01:48:13,565
<i>How do you feel now that you are
on stage for the last time?</i>

1457
01:48:13,739 --> 01:48:17,601
I've never felt better. There's
a whiff of anticipation in the air.

1458
01:48:17,780 --> 01:48:20,067
All my colleagues have come to see me off.

1459
01:48:20,238 --> 01:48:21,612
<i>That's nice of them.</i>

1460
01:48:21,780 --> 01:48:25,608
The reason for this outburst of affection is they
know they won't have to put up with me anymore.

1461
01:48:27,946 --> 01:48:31,193
Anyhow, I'm happy, Claire.
I just wish you were here.

1462
01:48:31,362 --> 01:48:32,820
<i>Me too.</i>

1463
01:48:32,987 --> 01:48:36,436
<i>But I'm not ready to travel yet.
I got dizzy in the car yesterday.</i>

1464
01:48:36,613 --> 01:48:40,143
Don't let it get to you. We have
all the time in the world to travel.

1465
01:48:40,320 --> 01:48:42,476
- We're ready, Mr. Oldman.
- I'm coming.

1466
01:48:43,362 --> 01:48:45,566
Have you heard from our young friends?

1467
01:48:45,738 --> 01:48:48,800
<i>Constantly. I'm never left on my own,
if that's what you're worried about.</i>

1468
01:48:48,900 --> 01:48:50,900
Good. Give them my love.

1469
01:48:51,903 --> 01:48:54,569
- <i>I can hear you've got to go.</i>
- Yes.

1470
01:48:55,652 --> 01:48:59,400
- But I can't wait to get back home.
- <i>Good luck, my darling.</i>

1471
01:49:00,153 --> 01:49:02,606
£12,100,000.

1472
01:49:05,778 --> 01:49:07,187
Any more?

1473
01:49:09,068 --> 01:49:11,473
£12,300,000.

1474
01:49:12,777 --> 01:49:14,318
Any advance?

1475
01:49:17,319 --> 01:49:19,808
12,500,000 on the telephone.

1476
01:49:21,319 --> 01:49:23,310
Any more?

1477
01:49:23,485 --> 01:49:26,102
All done at 12,500,000.

1478
01:49:26,443 --> 01:49:29,939
Sold for £12,500,000.

1479
01:49:31,276 --> 01:49:34,642
Ladies and gentlemen, I thank you.

1480
01:49:46,984 --> 01:49:50,314
- Good to see you.
- Thank you. Not a bad price.

1481
01:49:50,650 --> 01:49:52,806
Am I allowed to say hello to you in public?

1482
01:49:52,983 --> 01:49:54,973
Oh, Billy!

1483
01:49:55,316 --> 01:49:59,750
You were fantastic, my friend.
I'm happy for you. I'm going to miss you.

1484
01:49:59,850 --> 01:50:02,200
You say it as though we're
never going to meet again.

1485
01:50:02,399 --> 01:50:03,892
Of course we will.

1486
01:50:04,066 --> 01:50:07,596
But I'm feeling nostalgic
thinking about all our exploits.

1487
01:50:08,316 --> 01:50:10,223
- You'll get over it.
- Virgil?

1488
01:50:11,358 --> 01:50:14,300
To remind you of what
a great artist I could've been

1489
01:50:14,483 --> 01:50:18,346
if only you'd believed in me,
I've sent you one of my paintings.

1490
01:50:18,524 --> 01:50:20,700
I promise I won't burn it.

1491
01:50:30,607 --> 01:50:32,147
Claire.

1492
01:50:33,690 --> 01:50:35,231
Claire, I'm back.

1493
01:50:37,231 --> 01:50:38,772
Hello?

1494
01:50:42,300 --> 01:50:44,848
- Have you seen Miss Claire?
- No, sir.

1495
01:50:45,231 --> 01:50:46,772
Claire?

1496
01:50:48,398 --> 01:50:49,808
Where are you?

1497
01:50:51,565 --> 01:50:52,726
Claire?

1498
01:50:53,939 --> 01:50:56,723
Mr. Oldman, she must have gone out.

1499
01:50:57,064 --> 01:50:58,520
It was the same yesterday.

1500
01:50:58,688 --> 01:51:02,018
Sarah and Robert came to get her,
and then came back for lunch.

1501
01:51:02,189 --> 01:51:03,432
All right.

1502
01:52:26,892 --> 01:52:32,000
<i>There is always something authentic
concealed in every forgery.</i>

1504
01:52:32,100 --> 01:52:35,596
<i>I couldn't agree more.
That's why I'll miss you, Mr. Oldman.</i>

1505
01:52:35,766 --> 01:52:39,931
<i>There is always something authentic
concealed in every forgery.</i>

1507
01:52:40,101 --> 01:52:41,973
<i>I couldn't agree more.</i>

1508
01:52:42,142 --> 01:52:44,761
<i>That's why I'll miss you, Mr. Oldman.</i>

1509
01:52:44,933 --> 01:52:49,050
<i>There is always something authentic
concealed in every forgery.</i>

1511
01:52:49,226 --> 01:52:51,097
<i>I couldn't agree more.</i>

1512
01:52:51,265 --> 01:52:53,885
<i>That's why I'll miss you, Mr. Oldman.</i>

1513
01:52:54,057 --> 01:52:58,056
<i>There is always something authentic
concealed in every forgery.</i>

1515
01:52:58,391 --> 01:53:02,386
<i>I couldn't agree more.
That's why I'll miss you, Mr. Oldman.</i>

1516
01:53:02,558 --> 01:53:06,597
<i>There is always something authentic
concealed in every forgery.</i>

1518
01:53:06,766 --> 01:53:08,803
<i>I couldn't agree more.</i>

1519
01:53:08,973 --> 01:53:11,010
<i>That's why I'll miss you, Mr. Oldman.</i>

1520
01:53:11,182 --> 01:53:14,630
<i>There is always something authentic
concealed in every forgery.</i>

1521
01:53:31,139 --> 01:53:35,133
Good morning, Mr. Oldman.
We have visitors today.

1522
01:53:35,305 --> 01:53:38,423
Isn't this nice? Look who's come to see you!

1523
01:53:45,972 --> 01:53:48,129
How are you, Mr. Oldman?

1524
01:53:52,763 --> 01:53:54,504
I've brought your mail,

1525
01:53:54,847 --> 01:53:58,300
some newspapers and a few magazines.

1526
01:55:25,009 --> 01:55:28,872
A few days ago, they brought some
pieces of furniture to the villa opposite.

1527
01:55:32,426 --> 01:55:33,587
Did you notice?

1528
01:55:34,383 --> 01:55:37,400
I think so, but I don't see much from in here.

1529
01:55:37,966 --> 01:55:38,996
Ask her.

1530
01:55:47,050 --> 01:55:48,459
Claire...

1531
01:55:48,632 --> 01:55:51,087
Listen to what this gentleman wants to say.

1532
01:55:52,217 --> 01:55:53,246
Yes.

1533
01:55:54,632 --> 01:55:56,042
And the day after,

1534
01:55:56,216 --> 01:55:59,463
other workmen came and
took everything away again.

1535
01:56:01,591 --> 01:56:03,131
The day after?

1536
01:56:04,423 --> 01:56:08,369
In 18 months,
three deliveries and three removals.

1537
01:56:11,341 --> 01:56:13,626
I was here a while ago.

1538
01:56:14,923 --> 01:56:17,127
- Do you remember?
- Nine.

1539
01:56:19,589 --> 01:56:23,536
- What do you mean?
- You've been here nine times.

1540
01:56:25,590 --> 01:56:27,200
Today makes ten.

1541
01:56:27,381 --> 01:56:30,995
I was wondering if you saw
a woman leave the villa.

1542
01:56:32,254 --> 01:56:35,455
Medium height, light hair, a bit pale?

1543
01:56:36,755 --> 01:56:40,619
- Yes.
- That time was 231.

1544
01:56:42,215 --> 01:56:43,671
Are you sure?

1545
01:56:44,005 --> 01:56:45,664
Then another 6.

1546
01:56:46,506 --> 01:56:51,457
In a year and a half,
I saw her go out 237 times.

1547
01:56:51,837 --> 01:56:53,247
What did I say?

1548
01:56:53,421 --> 01:56:55,875
She's a phenomenon.
She remembers everything.

1549
01:56:57,921 --> 01:56:59,462
It's not possible.

1550
01:57:02,003 --> 01:57:04,124
You were at the villa 63 times.

1551
01:57:04,463 --> 01:57:08,372
36 during the day and 27 at night,

1552
01:57:08,712 --> 01:57:11,035
excluding the night of the accident.

1553
01:57:12,503 --> 01:57:15,916
- 1-4-4.
- 1-4-4?

1554
01:57:16,253 --> 01:57:18,493
The telephone number for the ambulance.

1555
01:57:19,962 --> 01:57:21,538
The villa is free now.

1556
01:57:21,920 --> 01:57:24,836
If you're interested, I'll get you a good deal.

1557
01:57:26,462 --> 01:57:29,079
- Who owns it?
- Me.

1558
01:57:30,294 --> 01:57:32,368
But I don't know what to do with it.

1559
01:57:33,460 --> 01:57:36,127
I often rent it out to cinema people.

1560
01:57:37,044 --> 01:57:38,418
Cinema people?

1561
01:57:39,003 --> 01:57:41,953
For the past two years,
it's been taken by the engineer

1562
01:57:42,128 --> 01:57:44,663
who does the lift
that takes me up to my house.

1563
01:57:45,460 --> 01:57:47,200
He's really nice, that boy.

1564
01:57:48,085 --> 01:57:49,743
He can do anything.

1565
01:57:49,918 --> 01:57:52,408
There's nothing he can't fix.

1566
01:57:53,001 --> 01:57:56,333
And he's always kissing me.

1567
01:57:56,501 --> 01:57:58,292
Bringing me flowers.

1568
02:00:43,618 --> 02:00:47,399
<i>The Paris Express is now arriving
at platform 7.</i>

1569
02:00:48,868 --> 02:00:50,574
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

1570
02:00:50,742 --> 02:00:53,575
<i>The Berlin-Prague Blue Arrow
is running 40 minutes late</i>

1571
02:00:53,742 --> 02:00:54,939
<i>due to fog on the line.</i>

1572
02:00:56,785 --> 02:00:58,325
Come in, sir.

1573
02:00:59,659 --> 02:01:02,029
We furnished it exactly as you requested.

1574
02:01:03,451 --> 02:01:05,939
And tomorrow, your trunks will be delivered.

1575
02:01:06,117 --> 02:01:09,233
And later, I'll pass by
with a copy of your contract.

1576
02:01:09,576 --> 02:01:12,941
If there's anything else,
please don't hesitate to call.

1577
02:01:19,408 --> 02:01:20,949
Oh, Virgil.

1578
02:01:22,367 --> 02:01:26,573
If anything should ever happen to us,
I want you to know that I do love you.

1579
02:03:50,360 --> 02:03:52,433
Are you on your own, sir?

1580
02:04:03,067 --> 02:04:05,770
No. I'm waiting for someone.
