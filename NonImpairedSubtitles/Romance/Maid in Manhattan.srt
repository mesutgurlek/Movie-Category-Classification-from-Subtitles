1
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,763
Come on. Get your coat.
We gotta go.

2
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:23,769
-You have everything?
-Yeah.

3
00:02:23,936 --> 00:02:25,938
Hurry up, sweetie. We're late.

4
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,487
Ty. Today, puppy.

5
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:37,616
You're killing me, Ty.
Right now, you're killing Mommy.

6
00:02:37,783 --> 00:02:40,160
-Okay, let's go.
-It's not my fault, Mom.

7
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:46,291
All right. You want to do
your speech for me?

8
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:48,794
Ty! Hello? That's better.

9
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:51,088
You don't have to listen
to that 24 hours a day.

10
00:02:51,255 --> 00:02:53,131
Wait. It’s Simon and Garfunkel.

11
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:56,468
That's why I tell you to tie your shoes.
I know. I'm sorry. Oh, my God.

12
00:02:56,635 --> 00:02:59,847
-You can't just turn them off, Mom.
-I understand, baby. Come on.

13
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:10,566
-Careful of the puddle.
-Why'd they break up?

14
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:12,818
-Who?
-Simon and Garfunkel.

15
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:16,780
You got me.
You can Google it at school.

16
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:26,957
Let's go.

17
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:33,755
Will I get in trouble
if I didn't give my speech?

18
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:35,465
Because I’m not really feeling it.

19
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:38,677
What do you mean? You've been
working all summer on that speech.

20
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:41,263
-I can't wait to hear it.
-It’s boring.

21
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:45,017
Not to me or to grandma
or to your dad.

22
00:03:45,184 --> 00:03:47,269
I thought we were meeting him after.

23
00:03:47,436 --> 00:03:51,773
No way. He's coming, and then you
guys are going camping. Remember?

24
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,651
He's gonna be late,
and then everyone will see.

25
00:03:57,196 --> 00:04:00,782
Look, he knows what time it starts.
Don't worry, he'll be there.

26
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:06,079
-Hey, look at me.
-What?

27
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,790
-You got something on your face there.
-Where?

28
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:11,460
-Right there.
-Ma! Mom! Mom, no! Stop!

29
00:04:11,627 --> 00:04:13,712
There it is. I got it!

30
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:22,804
-Hey, guys. How's it going?
-Hey, Ty.

31
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:26,475
What's up?
The speech thing is at 4:00.

32
00:04:26,642 --> 00:04:29,561
I know. Come here.
You got something on your face.

33
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:31,313
-Mom!
-What?

34
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:35,901
-Please.
-I’m sorry. Mr. Cool Guy.

35
00:04:37,236 --> 00:04:38,987
I love you.

36
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:44,451
Have a good day.

37
00:05:39,173 --> 00:05:41,466
-Morning, Marisa.
-What's up, Cora? How my diamonds?

38
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:45,554
-They're hanging with your rubies.
-I like the sound of that.

39
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:56,064
-Just made it, Marisa.
-I always do.

40
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:17,377
-Good morning, Marisa.
-What's up, Keef?

41
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:21,590
How's the weather?
Sunshine. That's nice.

42
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:23,342
Anything good on?

43
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:30,849
He opened the door for the paper.
The wife just pushed him out.

44
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:34,394
That nasty butt first thing
in the morning, I’d kick him out too.

45
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:38,106
Oh, my God. Wait a minute. He's
one of mine, the lactose intolerant.

46
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:40,067
I like how you name the people.

47
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:43,237
What do you call me
behind my back, I wonder.

48
00:06:44,655 --> 00:06:49,576
Yeah. Can I get a robe to the
Charles Suite ASAP? Thank you.

49
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:52,704
I call you God because you see
everything and you still smile.

50
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:57,960
-I’m cool with that. I surely am.
-I’ll see you later, Keef.

51
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:04,716
A Beresford maid is expedient.
A Beresford maid is thorough.

52
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:06,885
A Beresford maid serves with a smile.

53
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:10,264
And above all, a Beresford maid
strives to be invisible.

54
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,767
Maybe we can disappear
one day altogether.

55
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:18,772
You know what I just heard?

56
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:21,942
Christina? History after the 1st.

57
00:07:22,526 --> 00:07:24,653
Christina kitchen or
Christina assistant manager?

58
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,822
Assistant manager.
You know what that means?

59
00:07:26,989 --> 00:07:29,449
Somebody else is gonna be
busting my ass on the 2nd.

60
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:32,077
Wrong. It means we're gonna
need an assistant manager.

61
00:07:32,244 --> 00:07:37,207
-Yo, Barb, we still on for happy hour?
-Ten hours and counting.

62
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:38,625
Hey, Marisa, you here?

63
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:40,961
Can I finish getting dressed,
please? Thank you.

64
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:43,589
You're the one who keeps
talking about being a manager.

65
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:47,009
All I’m saying is, it could be you.

66
00:07:47,176 --> 00:07:48,969
They're not gonna make
a maid a manager.

67
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:52,472
Why not? Today's a new day.
Anything's possible.

68
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,433
You know what I’m saying?

69
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:07,196
Friday morning, people!
Lots to do. Heads up.

70
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:12,701
Mr. Bextrum has an announcement
to make. Mr. Bextrum.

71
00:08:12,868 --> 00:08:16,955
Christina Howard's promotion created
a vacancy that we've decided to fill...

72
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:19,875
...with in-house personnel.

73
00:08:20,042 --> 00:08:23,337
-Perhaps one of our butlers.
-Excuse me, Mr. Bextrum, sir?

74
00:08:23,504 --> 00:08:27,925
-Yes, Miss Kehoe?
-Can a maid apply?

75
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:32,262
Technically, if an employee's been
here for three consecutive years...

76
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:35,974
...he or, indeed, she,
is qualified to apply.

77
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:40,646
So yes. Sure. Absolutely.
Why not? Anything is possible.

78
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:43,857
You hear that?
The man said anything's possible.

79
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:46,235
Yeah, I guess he did.

80
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:48,946
On to new business.

81
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:54,535
Mr. Radcliff is checking out of 709.
Mr. Greenwald is checking in.

82
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:58,121
He's back on the wagon,
so let's clear out the minibar.

83
00:08:58,413 --> 00:09:01,667
Kanga CFO, Mr. Fukimoro,
is checking into 814.

84
00:09:01,834 --> 00:09:05,921
Stock Evian, shampoo the rugs
and extra slippers for his guests.

85
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:08,799
Marisa, heads up
on the Madison Suite.

86
00:09:08,966 --> 00:09:10,509
Housekeeping.

87
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:12,886
Mrs. Sage is arriving
with the children...

88
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:16,390
...preferably after Mr. Sage's
girlfriend departs.

89
00:09:16,557 --> 00:09:18,684
You son of a bitch!

90
00:09:18,851 --> 00:09:21,562
Let's make sure it's
a smooth transition.

91
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:24,565
The Guedj sisters are back.
We'll track them on surveillance...

92
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:28,694
...but do keep an eye on all
bathrobes, cutlery and light fixtures.

93
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:32,573
Sotheby's director, Caroline Lane,
has switched from the Four Seasons.

94
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:34,449
She requested a park view...

95
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:38,328
...and favours purple orchids
and lavender scents.

96
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:41,540
Assemblyman Chris Marshall
arrives today.

97
00:09:41,707 --> 00:09:43,125
He's gearing up his campaign...

98
00:09:43,292 --> 00:09:45,878
...so his suite will be doubling
as a conference centre...

99
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:49,715
...with the liquor and coffee bars
turning over every four hours.

100
00:09:49,882 --> 00:09:54,261
And he's bringing his large dog,
so we'll need proper accoutrements.

101
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:58,265
And finally, Mr. Newman is back
in the Sherman Suite.

102
00:09:58,432 --> 00:10:02,269
Careful, ladies, he's a full Monty.

103
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:09,026
-I had no idea anyone was here.
-Don't worry about it, Mr. Monty.

104
00:10:09,193 --> 00:10:10,861
No big deal.

105
00:10:11,028 --> 00:10:15,032
-And I do mean no big deal.
-No big deal.

106
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:23,790
Lavender!

107
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:27,336
-You're very creative, Marisa.
-Thank you, ma'am.

108
00:10:27,586 --> 00:10:31,924
Since you have to leave at 3:00,
go find Lionel and have him sign off.

109
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:38,639
-Sir, I need you to sign off on the--
-Damn!

110
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:42,226
Oh, good Lord. Here, let me.

111
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:44,978
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

112
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:47,523
Oh, God. Your hand's bleeding.

113
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,402
Here. Squeeze tight.

114
00:10:57,658 --> 00:11:01,453
Damn. He's checked in.

115
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:04,498
Quote, “Sentimental favourite
Chris Marshall...

116
00:11:04,665 --> 00:11:05,707
...blah, blah, blah...

117
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:08,627
...son of late Senator
Graham Marshall, blah, blah...

118
00:11:08,794 --> 00:11:11,964
...is expected to run for his father's
seat in the next election.”

119
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,633
-End quote.
-Let me see that. Let me see it, Jerry.

120
00:11:14,842 --> 00:11:16,760
You don't need to see it. No.

121
00:11:16,927 --> 00:11:19,972
-Give it here.
-Fine. But I hadn't finished it yet.

122
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:23,058
”Sentimental favourite
and playboy politico...

123
00:11:23,225 --> 00:11:26,562
...Assemblyman Chris Marshall....”
Guess you missed a few words, Jer.

124
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:28,313
What, “playboy”?
That's a compliment.

125
00:11:28,522 --> 00:11:32,359
”Who called off his engagement
to über babe Daniella Van Graas...

126
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:35,737
...arrives in town solo.”
Respectful, huh?

127
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:40,075
Well, listen, you know, you're
a public figure. It’s news. So what?

128
00:11:40,242 --> 00:11:42,536
We were never engaged.
Whose side are you on?

129
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:45,289
Yours. That's why sometimes
you have to listen to me.

130
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:47,749
-Every now and again it might be nice.
-Here.

131
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,710
Welcome to the Beresford,
Mr. Marshall.

132
00:11:49,877 --> 00:11:50,961
-Hello.
-My name is Lionel.

133
00:11:51,128 --> 00:11:52,462
-Lionel?
-I’m the floor butler.

134
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:54,882
lf there's anything you need,
please call me.

135
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:58,886
Thank you. This is Jerry,
and this is Dan, and the dog is Rufus.

136
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:01,096
Thank you, Lionel.
Nice to meet you. Thanks.

137
00:12:01,263 --> 00:12:04,725
We'll call you if we need you. Chris,
will you look at me, please? Chris?

138
00:12:04,892 --> 00:12:07,561
-Can you look at me for a minute?
-What? I am looking at you.

139
00:12:07,728 --> 00:12:10,063
We're going to Maddox's thing
on Monday night.

140
00:12:10,272 --> 00:12:11,273
No, Jerry, we're not.

141
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,526
See, this is when I wish your
old man were here to back me up.

142
00:12:14,735 --> 00:12:16,320
-What?
-I said, I wish your old man...

143
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:19,406
-...were here to back me up.
-My father had no use for that man.

144
00:12:19,573 --> 00:12:22,743
Your father knew how
to use that man.

145
00:12:23,285 --> 00:12:24,953
-Where are you going?
-What?

146
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,207
-That depends. Where are you going?
-Bathroom. Alone.

147
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:30,417
-Yeah. Fine. Go. Great. Yeah. Sure.
-Thank you.

148
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:32,711
Call me if you need anything.

149
00:12:37,508 --> 00:12:39,927
Oh, my God. I’m sorry, sir.

150
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:46,016
Thank you.

151
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:01,532
Sir.

152
00:13:02,658 --> 00:13:05,494
Thank you. Thank you very much.
I’m so clumsy.

153
00:13:05,661 --> 00:13:08,163
-Happens to all of us. Here.
-Thank you.

154
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:10,332
-Let me help you.
-Thank you.

155
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:14,503
-Where do those go?
-Caroline Lane. Park Suite.

156
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:18,090
She just checked in with a request
for immediate unpack and press.

157
00:13:18,257 --> 00:13:21,260
Here. Blood and Dolce:

158
00:13:22,678 --> 00:13:26,640
Thank you. Thank you.

159
00:13:27,808 --> 00:13:30,269
I mean, there are limits.

160
00:13:31,645 --> 00:13:36,066
You're so bad. You really are, Rach.

161
00:13:36,233 --> 00:13:38,902
Yes, just hold on a second.

162
00:13:39,069 --> 00:13:41,864
Thank you. Anything, I mean,
it's up and down.

163
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:45,117
One day, we're looking at rings,
and the next day, we're breaking up.

164
00:13:45,284 --> 00:13:47,995
Yeah. No way.

165
00:13:48,162 --> 00:13:49,997
So l...

166
00:13:50,164 --> 00:13:55,836
...had my assistant accidentally forward
my calendar for the week to his e-mail.

167
00:13:56,336 --> 00:14:01,508
Of course, I added a few extra lunch
dates and dinner parties with my ex.

168
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:04,011
Fantastic, right?

169
00:14:04,553 --> 00:14:07,973
Eric will be furious.

170
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:11,143
-That needs pressing.
-Okay.

171
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:14,897
But let's not forget Eric trades
commodities for a living.

172
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:19,610
A little competition right now
might increase my market value.

173
00:14:20,944 --> 00:14:24,865
Listen, my darling, I’m going
to be late. I’ll call you later, okay?

174
00:14:26,158 --> 00:14:27,534
Excuse me. Sorry.

175
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:31,538
Could you just hold up those two
outfits that Dolce sent over earlier?

176
00:14:33,123 --> 00:14:35,000
These two?

177
00:14:35,876 --> 00:14:40,088
Well, I just simply can't tell
without the stockings.

178
00:14:41,507 --> 00:14:44,301
Could I ask you an enormous favour?

179
00:14:44,593 --> 00:14:49,556
I mean, I know this isn't your job,
and I’d never normally ask, but I’m so....

180
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:52,893
-It’s okay.
-You're such a doll.

181
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:56,104
Would you run down to Madison
and get me three pairs of pantyhose?

182
00:14:56,271 --> 00:14:59,942
-The concierge usually does that.
-Yes, but it will get lost in translation.

183
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:02,486
Please. You look like
you're someone...

184
00:15:02,653 --> 00:15:05,697
...who knows the difference
between taupe and caramel.

185
00:15:07,074 --> 00:15:10,035
-Okay.
-Thanks.

186
00:15:11,662 --> 00:15:13,705
Here. Thank you so much.

187
00:15:13,872 --> 00:15:15,916
-Okay.
-Oh, and sorry.

188
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:19,086
Can you send someone else
to finish the unpacking, please?

189
00:15:19,253 --> 00:15:21,380
-Right away.
-Thanks.

190
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,173
Bye.

191
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:25,926
Attention! Somebody's coming!

192
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:31,056
-You think it's gonna rain?
-Maybe. It’s possible.

193
00:15:31,265 --> 00:15:32,599
-Hi, where's the fire?
-Nowhere.

194
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:34,852
I just got sent on an errand.
I’m already late.

195
00:15:35,018 --> 00:15:37,312
-Get these pressed for me?
-Sure, in my spare time.

196
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:39,314
By the way, two poodles
raiding your cart.

197
00:15:39,481 --> 00:15:40,732
-What?
-Can't be late for Ty!

198
00:15:49,074 --> 00:15:52,119
Mary Anne, if you don't wear
that dress, I’m gonna come over.

199
00:15:52,286 --> 00:15:55,622
I’m gonna go in your closet.
I’m gonna put it on for you.

200
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:58,208
Wait. Hold on a sec.

201
00:15:58,542 --> 00:16:00,752
Excuse me, miss?
Where are you going?

202
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:03,255
-In back to see if Carrie's here.
-Carrie's not here.

203
00:16:03,422 --> 00:16:05,090
So could you just step away?

204
00:16:05,257 --> 00:16:06,425
Away.

205
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:09,595
Away. Away from there.
Thank you.

206
00:16:09,845 --> 00:16:13,223
Hi. Sorry. Okay, so you go first.

207
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:16,643
No, you! No, you.

208
00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:18,478
Get out.

209
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:22,065
-Get out.
-Excuse me, just a moment.

210
00:16:22,232 --> 00:16:24,359
You know what? I have customers,
so go on quick.

211
00:16:24,526 --> 00:16:27,738
Yeah. Then what?

212
00:16:27,905 --> 00:16:29,406
No, he didn't.

213
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:31,783
-No, he didn't.
-Can I just ask you one question?

214
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:36,830
You know what, ma'am?
You have to wait. Okay?

215
00:16:36,997 --> 00:16:40,584
What? No, a maid.

216
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,377
-I don't know.
-Yo.

217
00:16:42,544 --> 00:16:44,671
-You can't be back here.
-Leezette?

218
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:46,423
What are you doing?

219
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:49,134
Being that we're sisters
in the service business...

220
00:16:49,301 --> 00:16:50,427
...and I’m in a rush...

221
00:16:50,594 --> 00:16:53,222
...I’d say you start serving
your low-end customers...

222
00:16:53,388 --> 00:16:55,349
...because that's
the reason you're here.

223
00:16:55,516 --> 00:16:58,310
Unless we're not good enough
for you to service.

224
00:16:58,727 --> 00:17:00,896
In which case,
I’m sure your manager is.

225
00:17:01,063 --> 00:17:03,273
What do you say, ladies?
Am I right or am I right?

226
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,734
-You're right.
-Oh, yes.

227
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:11,281
-Sorry, Mom.
-Baby, where were you?

228
00:17:11,448 --> 00:17:12,574
Keef, do me a favour.

229
00:17:12,741 --> 00:17:14,535
These go to the goddess
in the Park Suite.

230
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:17,996
-I got you. Don't forget the bags.
-Thank you.

231
00:17:18,163 --> 00:17:19,414
Are you ready?

232
00:17:19,581 --> 00:17:22,584
-I’m not gonna have time to change.
-Sure you do. We'll be a little late.

233
00:17:22,751 --> 00:17:25,546
No, Ma, we cannot be late, okay?

234
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:27,297
-Come on.
-I was on time.

235
00:17:28,298 --> 00:17:30,592
Are they here yet?

236
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:50,070
-Hello?
-Marisa?

237
00:17:50,237 --> 00:17:53,365
Yeah. Marcus. Yeah.

238
00:17:53,532 --> 00:17:55,075
No, I can't hear you.

239
00:17:55,242 --> 00:17:58,245
-When's Ty's speech again?
-I’ll get it.

240
00:17:58,412 --> 00:18:00,664
In 20 minutes, at 4:00.

241
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:03,375
-And you cannot be late.
-Well....

242
00:18:03,584 --> 00:18:05,127
Marcus!

243
00:18:06,086 --> 00:18:09,089
-You're just breaking up. What?
-I can't be there. I'm in Miami.

244
00:18:09,256 --> 00:18:11,925
-Please tell me you're kidding.
-I'm in Miami with Mugsy.

245
00:18:12,092 --> 00:18:14,344
Don't do this to me, Marcus.

246
00:18:14,511 --> 00:18:17,556
Don't let him get away with it.
Be strong, Marisa.

247
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:20,017
What am I supposed
to tell him this time?

248
00:18:20,184 --> 00:18:21,977
-This weekend is the holiday.
-I know.

249
00:18:22,269 --> 00:18:24,354
-He's counting on it.
-He'll get over it.

250
00:18:24,521 --> 00:18:27,858
-I'll take him at Christmas, okay?
-Tell somebody who believes you.

251
00:18:28,025 --> 00:18:30,068
I gotta go.

252
00:18:31,904 --> 00:18:33,739
That shit.

253
00:18:35,449 --> 00:18:37,367
This fell out of your bag. Is it yours?

254
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:41,246
Yeah, thanks.

255
00:18:42,456 --> 00:18:44,750
Management, huh?

256
00:18:45,459 --> 00:18:46,919
How fancy.

257
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:51,465
What?

258
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:53,759
I’m not saying a word.

259
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:56,929
Can you not say a word
somewhere else?

260
00:18:58,639 --> 00:19:02,392
And our next speaker
will be Ty Ventura.

261
00:19:28,085 --> 00:19:29,711
Richard Milhous Nixon...

262
00:19:32,506 --> 00:19:35,634
...was a man
of many contradictions.

263
00:19:37,344 --> 00:19:40,472
Even though
he is remembered in history...

264
00:19:40,681 --> 00:19:44,101
...as the only president
to ever resign...

265
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:52,484
...his foreign policies
and his relations with China...

266
00:19:52,693 --> 00:19:56,947
...opened up the Western door
to Eastern--

267
00:19:57,114 --> 00:20:01,118
I mean, Eastern door
to Western ties.

268
00:20:01,285 --> 00:20:03,162
That's enough.

269
00:20:03,662 --> 00:20:07,958
Born a Quaker,
he was nevertheless....

270
00:20:08,959 --> 00:20:12,713
He was responsible for bombing...

271
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,842
...for the violent bombing of....

272
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:22,848
Richard Nixon was born in....

273
00:20:47,915 --> 00:20:50,042
Hey, baby.

274
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:56,882
They were all laughing at me,
and then I lost my words.

275
00:20:57,049 --> 00:21:00,052
You know, it happens
sometimes, honey.

276
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:03,472
I never want to do that again, okay?

277
00:21:05,891 --> 00:21:08,519
You're going to do better next time.

278
00:21:08,685 --> 00:21:10,395
No.

279
00:21:13,232 --> 00:21:15,984
All right, we'll talk about it later...

280
00:21:16,151 --> 00:21:21,031
...because I got something for you.
The new Nixon tapes.

281
00:21:24,451 --> 00:21:27,913
Come on, you know
you wanna open it.

282
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:33,001
Mom.

283
00:21:34,878 --> 00:21:36,630
Oh, puppy.

284
00:21:36,797 --> 00:21:38,215
I’m sorry.

285
00:21:41,844 --> 00:21:43,929
Where's Dad?

286
00:21:46,098 --> 00:21:48,475
He had a construction job
in Poughkeepsie.

287
00:21:48,642 --> 00:21:51,562
It was paying time and a half,
and he had to do it, baby.

288
00:21:53,021 --> 00:21:54,314
It’s okay.

289
00:21:54,481 --> 00:21:58,485
So you'll hang out with me
at the hotel this weekend, okay?

290
00:22:09,454 --> 00:22:11,290
A married guy was buying
clothes for his girlfriend.

291
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:13,625
I know. He gave me
his number yesterday.

292
00:22:13,792 --> 00:22:15,794
-What's up, Frannie, Michelle?
-Good morning.

293
00:22:15,961 --> 00:22:19,131
-Hey, Ty, how are you?
-What's up, Ty?

294
00:22:22,009 --> 00:22:23,510
Lily?

295
00:22:23,677 --> 00:22:25,679
We're here.

296
00:22:25,846 --> 00:22:29,892
Hey, are you going to keep me
company today, Ty?

297
00:22:30,058 --> 00:22:31,935
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

298
00:22:32,102 --> 00:22:37,357
Now, he's got books and puzzles
and all kinds of fun stuff. Right, baby?

299
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:43,113
-I’m on 22 if you need me, okay?
-Okay.

300
00:22:43,488 --> 00:22:45,949
So I’ll see you at lunchtime.

301
00:22:48,243 --> 00:22:49,328
You all right?

302
00:22:51,246 --> 00:22:52,498
I’m cool.

303
00:22:56,793 --> 00:22:59,296
You know, I am really sorry
about all this.

304
00:23:01,131 --> 00:23:03,550
It’s not your fault.

305
00:23:06,053 --> 00:23:09,264
-See you later. Thank you.
-Sure.

306
00:23:13,268 --> 00:23:14,853
What's with the face?

307
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:18,315
He's a kid. He has
a whole hotel to play with.

308
00:23:18,482 --> 00:23:20,859
-We come here every day.
-He'll have a ball.

309
00:23:21,026 --> 00:23:22,152
You said it.

310
00:23:22,861 --> 00:23:26,114
-You need to loosen up.
-I’m not interested.

311
00:23:26,281 --> 00:23:27,991
-Why are you stealing my tissues?
-I need them.

312
00:23:28,158 --> 00:23:32,830
While you're there, get me soap,
shower caps, some Kiehl's.

313
00:23:32,996 --> 00:23:37,501
We need some fun in our lives.
Be spontaneous, kick up our skirts.

314
00:23:38,502 --> 00:23:40,838
-The expression is “heels.”
-Maybe for you.

315
00:23:41,004 --> 00:23:42,965
-I’m with you, girl.
-You only live once.

316
00:23:43,131 --> 00:23:45,592
-You know. Come on.
-No.

317
00:23:47,928 --> 00:23:49,263
Live it, girl.

318
00:23:49,429 --> 00:23:51,306
I’m living.

319
00:23:51,473 --> 00:23:52,516
I’m living.

320
00:23:53,433 --> 00:23:56,812
Come on, help me clean the
Park Suite. You're not doing nothing.

321
00:24:00,023 --> 00:24:02,776
Oh, sorry. Aren't you
the maid I had yesterday?

322
00:24:02,943 --> 00:24:05,863
-Yes, ma'am.
-Oh, fantastic. I need another favour.

323
00:24:06,029 --> 00:24:07,781
I’m late for lunch,
otherwise I’d do it.

324
00:24:07,948 --> 00:24:11,910
Would you run down to the boutique
and return the outfits in the closet?

325
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:14,746
-Sure, I’ll take care of it.
-Thank you. You're the best.

326
00:24:14,913 --> 00:24:16,415
Okay.

327
00:24:16,623 --> 00:24:18,750
-Who's she?
-She's the goddess.

328
00:24:18,917 --> 00:24:21,753
She's staying in the Park Suite.
You two have a lot in common.

329
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,339
Yeah? Then why am I the one
wearing the uniform?

330
00:24:24,506 --> 00:24:26,967
What I meant was
that she also has a boyfriend...

331
00:24:27,134 --> 00:24:30,012
...who she's been with for a while,
who still has not popped--

332
00:24:30,179 --> 00:24:32,806
Her cherry?
Because then we'd be identical.

333
00:24:32,973 --> 00:24:36,935
-What are you looking at?
-I meant the question.

334
00:24:37,102 --> 00:24:39,438
My God, is your mind always...

335
00:24:39,605 --> 00:24:41,773
...on the pepperoni?

336
00:24:41,982 --> 00:24:44,193
That's right, baby.

337
00:24:54,536 --> 00:24:57,748
All right, here's the difference
between me and the goddess.

338
00:24:57,915 --> 00:25:00,459
She's playing games
to trick him into wanting her--

339
00:25:00,626 --> 00:25:03,337
-And you're what?
-I’m working hard for the money.

340
00:25:03,504 --> 00:25:07,382
Speaking of which, you hand
in your application? Management?

341
00:25:07,549 --> 00:25:09,051
Yeah.

342
00:25:11,303 --> 00:25:12,971
What are you doing?

343
00:25:13,847 --> 00:25:17,476
-Dolce, nice.
-No, no, come on, get out of there.

344
00:25:17,643 --> 00:25:20,604
I’m just taking a little peek.
They're going back anyway.

345
00:25:20,771 --> 00:25:22,397
You're gonna get us in trouble.

346
00:25:22,731 --> 00:25:24,816
Hello, ladies.

347
00:25:25,025 --> 00:25:26,777
Leave that stuff alone. Come on.

348
00:25:26,944 --> 00:25:28,987
You're supposed to be
helping me out in here.

349
00:25:29,196 --> 00:25:31,448
Feel this material.

350
00:25:31,615 --> 00:25:34,535
I mean, it's like butter.

351
00:25:36,829 --> 00:25:38,956
Oh, my God.

352
00:25:39,122 --> 00:25:42,042
This stuff is $5000.

353
00:25:42,209 --> 00:25:45,838
For one white outfit?
How do you keep it clean?

354
00:25:46,046 --> 00:25:47,172
Scotchgard.

355
00:25:47,381 --> 00:25:49,299
Oh, yeah.
They're a 6, you're a 6.

356
00:25:49,466 --> 00:25:51,677
What are you doing?
What are you doing?!

357
00:25:51,844 --> 00:25:53,846
And shoes too.

358
00:25:54,012 --> 00:25:56,348
Shoes. Size 9. Perfect.

359
00:25:56,515 --> 00:25:58,183
-I’m a 7 1/2.
-Which means you're an 8.

360
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:01,353
Just put on some gym socks,
you're good to go.

361
00:26:02,145 --> 00:26:04,606
That's it. Put this stuff back.
What are you doing?

362
00:26:04,773 --> 00:26:06,149
Not until you try it on.

363
00:26:06,316 --> 00:26:08,318
I can't try on her clothes!

364
00:26:08,819 --> 00:26:12,948
They're not hers. They're not Dolce's.
Technically, they've been abandoned.

365
00:26:13,115 --> 00:26:15,117
Let's not let them hear us.

366
00:26:15,284 --> 00:26:16,285
Who, the clothes?

367
00:26:16,451 --> 00:26:17,911
Marisa Ave Maria Ventura...

368
00:26:18,078 --> 00:26:22,207
...when will you or I ever get
to try on a $5000 anything?

369
00:26:22,374 --> 00:26:28,172
Come on, feel how
the other half feels, huh?

370
00:26:30,883 --> 00:26:32,634
Hey, Lily, what are you doing?

371
00:26:32,801 --> 00:26:36,555
Hey. I’m sewing on a button.

372
00:26:36,763 --> 00:26:39,099
What's the cook making for lunch?

373
00:26:39,266 --> 00:26:42,978
Saturday, you'll have
mac and cheese.

374
00:26:48,817 --> 00:26:50,569
Where you going?

375
00:26:50,736 --> 00:26:52,779
Around. I’ll be right back.

376
00:26:52,946 --> 00:26:56,283
-Stay close, okay?
-Okay.

377
00:26:56,783 --> 00:26:57,784
Rufus.

378
00:26:57,951 --> 00:27:00,412
Rufus, come here.
Come here. Sit.

379
00:27:00,579 --> 00:27:01,914
-Where are you going?
-For a walk.

380
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,625
No, there's a League of Women Voters
lunch downstairs.

381
00:27:04,791 --> 00:27:06,877
-We should do a drive-by.
-A quick pit stop?

382
00:27:07,044 --> 00:27:08,545
Yeah, in and out.
Leave them laughing.

383
00:27:08,712 --> 00:27:11,256
-Hey, Jer, quick question. Be honest.
-Sure thing.

384
00:27:11,423 --> 00:27:13,342
Do I look as stupid
as you think I am?

385
00:27:13,509 --> 00:27:16,220
No. I mean, you're not stupid.
What are you talking about?

386
00:27:16,386 --> 00:27:18,138
-Come on.
-Where are you going? No.

387
00:27:18,305 --> 00:27:20,265
You have a problem
with the ladies' lunch?

388
00:27:20,432 --> 00:27:22,935
I have a problem trying to upstage
Victor Delgado. Remember him?

389
00:27:23,143 --> 00:27:27,147
The guy running against me for Senate,
scheduled to speak downstairs?

390
00:27:27,314 --> 00:27:28,899
He's not speaking until 1:30.

391
00:27:36,156 --> 00:27:39,368
I know this offends your sense
of fairness, but I’d like to win.

392
00:27:39,535 --> 00:27:41,537
-You don't give up.
-No, of course not.

393
00:27:41,703 --> 00:27:44,748
That's why you hired me.
Look, you go to the luncheon, okay?

394
00:27:44,915 --> 00:27:48,377
You go to Maddox's thing on Monday.
”Hello,” “goodbye,” you're home free.

395
00:27:48,544 --> 00:27:50,754
Define “free.”

396
00:27:52,256 --> 00:27:56,176
Look, they have people who will
walk your dog for you.

397
00:27:56,343 --> 00:27:59,221
-I mean, I know that's a crazy idea.
-I want to walk my own dog.

398
00:27:59,388 --> 00:28:01,390
Relax. You're starting
to lose your hair.

399
00:28:03,517 --> 00:28:05,102
He's friendly.

400
00:28:05,269 --> 00:28:07,813
-His name is Rufus.
-Hey, Rufus.

401
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,148
So, what are you listening to?

402
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:16,655
-The Best of Bread.
-Best of Bread? Interesting.

403
00:28:16,989 --> 00:28:18,657
What's your name?

404
00:28:18,949 --> 00:28:22,661
-Ty.
-Nice to meet you, Ty. I’m Chris.

405
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:24,746
I’m bald and no one in particular.

406
00:28:24,913 --> 00:28:26,081
I know who you are.

407
00:28:27,541 --> 00:28:28,959
Yeah? What do you know?

408
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:32,171
I know that you're
the state assemblyman.

409
00:28:32,379 --> 00:28:34,715
I know you're thinking
of running for senator.

410
00:28:34,882 --> 00:28:38,260
I know your voting record and
your stand on environmental causes.

411
00:28:38,719 --> 00:28:40,012
Great.

412
00:28:40,179 --> 00:28:43,307
-Look, I hate to interrupt, but--
-Are you Republican?

413
00:28:44,558 --> 00:28:46,101
Yes.

414
00:28:46,268 --> 00:28:47,436
Why?

415
00:28:47,603 --> 00:28:49,396
Richard Nixon was Republican.

416
00:28:49,563 --> 00:28:50,856
So what?

417
00:28:51,023 --> 00:28:52,816
-He lied.
-So, what does that mean?

418
00:28:52,983 --> 00:28:54,526
Nothing.

419
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,237
Who told you to ask
these questions?

420
00:28:57,654 --> 00:28:58,780
Nobody.

421
00:28:59,114 --> 00:29:01,700
What press are you affiliated with?

422
00:29:02,201 --> 00:29:03,202
I’m 10.

423
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:05,120
Your parents?
Democrat or Republican?

424
00:29:05,287 --> 00:29:07,831
-What's the difference these days?
-I love this kid.

425
00:29:07,998 --> 00:29:09,917
Well, what's not to love?

426
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:12,503
-Where you going?
-I’m gonna walk Rufus.

427
00:29:12,669 --> 00:29:16,381
What, are you writing a book?
In 10 minutes, okay?

428
00:29:16,548 --> 00:29:18,467
-One pee.
-lf Mom says okay, can I come?

429
00:29:18,634 --> 00:29:20,594
-What?
-lf my mom says okay, can I come?

430
00:29:20,761 --> 00:29:23,972
-Sure. Where's your mom?
-Back on 22. Park Suite.

431
00:29:24,139 --> 00:29:26,141
No, you know what, Chris?
You're in a hurry.

432
00:29:26,308 --> 00:29:29,645
-He doesn't have time.
-No, he's in a hurry. I’m fine.

433
00:29:29,811 --> 00:29:31,021
-You take him.
-What?

434
00:29:31,188 --> 00:29:33,232
I’ll go up with you.
I forgot his ball anyway.

435
00:29:33,398 --> 00:29:35,692
I don't want to-- Wait!

436
00:29:39,446 --> 00:29:41,490
Hold on!

437
00:29:46,286 --> 00:29:48,121
Hi, honey. It’s Ty!

438
00:29:48,288 --> 00:29:50,290
What are you doing up here?

439
00:29:50,457 --> 00:29:51,500
Where's Mom?

440
00:29:55,295 --> 00:29:57,089
It’s for you, ma'am.

441
00:29:57,256 --> 00:29:58,924
What are you talking about?
Ty, don't you--?

442
00:29:59,091 --> 00:30:02,386
Hey, Ma, this is Chris. He's got
a giant grey dog named Rufus.

443
00:30:02,553 --> 00:30:06,265
And if you say okay,
I’m gonna go walk with him, okay?

444
00:30:06,473 --> 00:30:08,433
-Hello.
-Hi.

445
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:12,604
Let's not forget. I’m a kid and I need
fresh air. Please, can I go, Mom?

446
00:30:12,813 --> 00:30:14,690
I’m Chris Marshall.

447
00:30:15,023 --> 00:30:16,567
Caroline...

448
00:30:17,484 --> 00:30:18,735
...you want your coat?

449
00:30:18,902 --> 00:30:21,697
-What?
-The weather can be so tricky here.

450
00:30:21,864 --> 00:30:23,782
Weren't you saying
what a beautiful day it was?

451
00:30:24,158 --> 00:30:25,576
Oh, you're going out?

452
00:30:25,742 --> 00:30:28,662
Weren't you saying how you
wanted to stretch your legs?

453
00:30:28,829 --> 00:30:31,123
Well, if your husband
wouldn't mind....

454
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:33,542
She doesn't have a husband.

455
00:30:34,168 --> 00:30:36,128
-I don't have a husband.
-I insist, then.

456
00:30:36,336 --> 00:30:38,172
-Come with us, if you're free.
-Yeah.

457
00:30:38,338 --> 00:30:40,257
-Come on, Mom.
-Here we go.

458
00:30:40,424 --> 00:30:42,217
I can't.

459
00:30:44,344 --> 00:30:46,096
-Put these on.
-The shoes are too big.

460
00:30:46,263 --> 00:30:48,640
Have a good time. Have fun.

461
00:30:49,474 --> 00:30:53,145
-Come on, Ty, let's go find Rufus.
-Come on, Mom.

462
00:30:53,353 --> 00:30:55,939
Mr. Marshall, John Bextrum,
hotel manager.

463
00:30:56,106 --> 00:30:57,274
This is fun.

464
00:30:57,441 --> 00:31:00,110
-So be cool, okay?
-Okay.

465
00:31:00,277 --> 00:31:02,237
What's this?

466
00:31:02,404 --> 00:31:04,448
lf that slips out again,
tuck it in for me.

467
00:31:04,615 --> 00:31:07,159
And the night before.
You're not answering your pager.

468
00:31:07,326 --> 00:31:09,411
-Really? I never got the message.
-Really?

469
00:31:09,578 --> 00:31:10,871
You said you'd take us to Nike town.

470
00:31:11,038 --> 00:31:13,457
Well, here, I’ll go down with you.

471
00:31:24,635 --> 00:31:25,844
Scotchgard?

472
00:31:36,813 --> 00:31:38,023
Au revoir.

473
00:31:38,482 --> 00:31:39,691
Bye-Bye.

474
00:31:39,858 --> 00:31:41,485
Bye.

475
00:31:45,239 --> 00:31:48,575
Come on, Rufus, just pee
because I have stuff to do.

476
00:31:48,742 --> 00:31:52,371
-Pee! Lift your leg.
-Jerry Siegel, is that you?

477
00:31:52,579 --> 00:31:54,498
Hey, Maddox, how are you?
Small world.

478
00:31:54,665 --> 00:31:55,916
You know Victor Delgado.

479
00:31:56,083 --> 00:31:58,752
Victor, Jerry Siegel,
Chris Marshall's right-hand.

480
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:02,464
-You groom also?
-That's good.

481
00:32:02,631 --> 00:32:06,552
I was showing Victor our new
building on 57th. Wanna join us?

482
00:32:06,718 --> 00:32:08,595
No, I can't. I’m jammed.
I’ve got--

483
00:32:08,762 --> 00:32:10,973
-I can see that.
-Well, I mean--

484
00:32:11,139 --> 00:32:13,225
Don't forget to scoop.

485
00:32:16,562 --> 00:32:18,856
Kill! Kill! Rufus! Kill!

486
00:32:19,022 --> 00:32:22,025
Let's go. You're gonna
have to hold it. Come on!

487
00:32:23,735 --> 00:32:26,113
Okay, I’ll handle it.
Walk to the park.

488
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:29,074
I’ll get Rufus and Jerry,
and we'll catch up. Go ahead.

489
00:32:29,241 --> 00:32:32,202
Guys, there's nothing here.
Just an old friend and her son.

490
00:32:32,369 --> 00:32:35,122
-She got a name?
-Yeah, “Unidentified Old Friend.”

491
00:32:35,873 --> 00:32:38,625
You give me this,
I’ll give you 15 minutes...

492
00:32:38,792 --> 00:32:40,627
...inside the benefit,
Monday night.

493
00:32:40,794 --> 00:32:42,254
You'll get us in at the Met?

494
00:32:42,421 --> 00:32:43,797
-You got it.
-Open bar?

495
00:32:43,964 --> 00:32:46,717
-Don't push it.
-Thank you.

496
00:32:48,135 --> 00:32:49,720
Come on, Rufus.

497
00:32:49,887 --> 00:32:51,847
Did you have fun
with mean, old Jerry?

498
00:32:52,014 --> 00:32:54,057
A great time!
It was perfect timing.

499
00:32:54,224 --> 00:32:57,936
Both Delgado and Maddox
saw me walking your goddamn dog.

500
00:32:58,145 --> 00:33:01,106
See, you should get out more.
Come on, Rufus.

501
00:33:01,273 --> 00:33:03,775
He's gonna be there.
He's gonna be there at 1:30.

502
00:33:03,942 --> 00:33:07,154
I want you there at 1:00, okay?
All right? Okay?

503
00:33:07,321 --> 00:33:09,656
Bye. I’m going to shower.

504
00:33:10,491 --> 00:33:11,700
I just borrowed them.
Pretty hot, though, huh?

505
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,660
I just borrowed them.
Pretty hot, though, huh?

506
00:33:13,827 --> 00:33:15,954
-Wait up!
-Don't say anything. Just act--

507
00:33:18,373 --> 00:33:21,168
I couldn't do it.
All those photographers all the time.

508
00:33:21,335 --> 00:33:23,754
You don't know what you can do
until you have to.

509
00:33:23,921 --> 00:33:26,798
There's not a lot of choice.
You get used to it.

510
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:29,051
-Can I take him?
-Sure. Go ahead.

511
00:33:29,218 --> 00:33:30,969
-Be careful. He's strong.
-Come on.

512
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:33,680
-Be careful and stay close.
-I will.

513
00:33:35,057 --> 00:33:36,725
Hang on!

514
00:33:39,853 --> 00:33:43,857
Thanks for this.
He's been a little down lately.

515
00:33:44,024 --> 00:33:47,569
Then yesterday, he gave a speech
at school, and he messed it up.

516
00:33:47,736 --> 00:33:48,821
It was bad.

517
00:33:49,029 --> 00:33:52,491
Speeches can be tricky.
What happened?

518
00:33:52,699 --> 00:33:55,160
I don't know.
He just froze and ran off-stage.

519
00:33:55,369 --> 00:33:58,831
Now he has this thing about speaking
in public. He's all freaked out.

520
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:01,959
I always get nervous
before I go on.

521
00:34:02,376 --> 00:34:05,337
-Really?
-Yeah.

522
00:34:05,796 --> 00:34:09,508
Well, not always.
Just sometimes.

523
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:11,760
-Mr. Marshall?
-Look at the dogs.

524
00:34:11,927 --> 00:34:15,514
What a surprise, a dog walker.
Let me guess. Jerry sent you.

525
00:34:15,722 --> 00:34:17,641
Yeah, to get Rufus.

526
00:34:17,808 --> 00:34:19,226
-Is that Rufus?
-That's him.

527
00:34:19,393 --> 00:34:20,811
He's beautiful.

528
00:34:20,978 --> 00:34:22,688
-Can l?
-Sure.

529
00:34:22,855 --> 00:34:24,273
-Hey, buddy!
-Can I have him?

530
00:34:24,439 --> 00:34:26,525
-Okay.
-Thank you.

531
00:34:26,817 --> 00:34:29,236
-Ma, can I go play?
-Yeah, go ahead.

532
00:34:30,195 --> 00:34:31,405
This is for you.

533
00:34:31,989 --> 00:34:34,867
-Thank you.
-Bye. Let's go.

534
00:34:37,911 --> 00:34:39,246
It’s from my nanny.

535
00:34:39,496 --> 00:34:41,248
Do you want to sit down?

536
00:34:41,582 --> 00:34:44,334
-Sure.
-Over here.

537
00:34:50,674 --> 00:34:53,177
Cool, I won't get dirty.

538
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,598
Oh, Lord! I almost sat on your face.
Right there.

539
00:35:10,277 --> 00:35:12,988
Ty seems like a terrific kid.

540
00:35:13,447 --> 00:35:16,283
Thanks. I’m kind of crazy
about him.

541
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:21,038
I’ve never met a 10-year-old
Nixon aficionado.

542
00:35:21,205 --> 00:35:25,417
Yeah, I know. Last year,
they studied the '70s at school...

543
00:35:25,584 --> 00:35:28,462
...and he's become obsessed
with the politics, the music.

544
00:35:28,629 --> 00:35:30,631
He was reading
the Kissinger biography.

545
00:35:30,797 --> 00:35:32,549
-You're kidding!
-No.

546
00:35:32,716 --> 00:35:36,970
I’m waiting for him to discover another
decade. Until then, I’m learning a lot.

547
00:35:37,262 --> 00:35:40,265
Well, I think it's great.

548
00:35:40,766 --> 00:35:43,352
-You do?
-I do.

549
00:35:45,145 --> 00:35:48,190
Guess what? I threw a stick
in the air, and Rufus caught it!

550
00:35:48,357 --> 00:35:51,735
-Really?
-Yeah. I’m gonna go do it again.

551
00:35:52,194 --> 00:35:56,156
So how long are you
in town for?

552
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,785
I’m not sure.

553
00:35:59,993 --> 00:36:01,745
You always stay at the Beresford?

554
00:36:03,956 --> 00:36:06,959
Sometimes I feel like I live there.

555
00:36:07,501 --> 00:36:09,628
So, what brings you here?

556
00:36:10,671 --> 00:36:13,674
-Work.
-What do you do?

557
00:36:16,218 --> 00:36:19,680
-Oh, my God! 11:00, by the tree.
-What?

558
00:36:19,847 --> 00:36:21,807
Check it, 11:00.

559
00:36:22,307 --> 00:36:23,684
That's Eddie Yatter.

560
00:36:23,851 --> 00:36:26,854
-What does he want?
-He's paparazzi. I can't shake him.

561
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:29,439
He works for Blanton Maddox...

562
00:36:29,606 --> 00:36:32,526
...whose goal lately is
to catch me with another woman...

563
00:36:32,693 --> 00:36:37,531
...so his sleazy tabloid can say
that I’ve broken up with--

564
00:36:37,698 --> 00:36:40,200
Your supermodel fiancée?

565
00:36:40,367 --> 00:36:41,952
Oh, God! Ty!

566
00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:44,246
-What?
-Come on!

567
00:36:45,038 --> 00:36:48,000
-I just realized that you--
-Excuse me?

568
00:36:48,167 --> 00:36:50,669
-Sorry, it's just that my face is--
-What?

569
00:36:50,836 --> 00:36:53,422
-What's wrong with your face?
-It’s stuck to your--

570
00:36:53,589 --> 00:36:55,132
What's that?

571
00:36:55,299 --> 00:37:00,012
-Oh, God. Oh, God! Get it off.
-Here, let me. It’s okay.

572
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:03,515
Oh, my God! Did I get
anything on it? Is it okay?

573
00:37:03,682 --> 00:37:05,350
It’s perfect.

574
00:37:07,811 --> 00:37:09,730
-So....
-Okay.

575
00:37:09,897 --> 00:37:12,191
Don't believe everything you read.

576
00:37:12,357 --> 00:37:15,194
-Any of it true?
-No.

577
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:20,240
Well, we were seeing each other.
Now we're seeing less of each other.

578
00:37:20,407 --> 00:37:22,534
It’s complicated.

579
00:37:22,993 --> 00:37:26,246
I want to show you something.
Follow me.

580
00:37:32,669 --> 00:37:33,879
Oh, God.

581
00:37:34,087 --> 00:37:38,592
-Let me help you.
-I got it. It’s fine. I’m good.

582
00:37:39,843 --> 00:37:41,762
Don't worry about me.

583
00:37:41,929 --> 00:37:44,014
Look at that.

584
00:37:47,184 --> 00:37:49,603
It’s like two different worlds.

585
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:53,065
-Interesting perspective, huh?
-Yeah.

586
00:37:53,273 --> 00:37:56,109
And I’d like to point out
it's paparazzi-free.

587
00:37:57,569 --> 00:38:01,073
You know when I come here most
is when I have to make a speech...

588
00:38:01,281 --> 00:38:02,616
...and I get nervous.

589
00:38:02,783 --> 00:38:04,117
-You get nervous?
-Sure.

590
00:38:04,284 --> 00:38:05,285
See that?

591
00:38:05,452 --> 00:38:08,539
Sometimes when I have
to stand up in front of people...

592
00:38:08,705 --> 00:38:12,626
...my heart kind of races,
and I can't remember my words.

593
00:38:12,793 --> 00:38:16,255
-Same here. I know.
-Really? Same with you?

594
00:38:16,421 --> 00:38:19,591
Wow. Well, in my business,
it's not a good thing.

595
00:38:19,967 --> 00:38:22,636
-What do you do?
-What do I do?

596
00:38:23,262 --> 00:38:25,055
I want to show you something.

597
00:38:26,265 --> 00:38:29,810
I hold on to this.

598
00:38:30,644 --> 00:38:32,771
A paper clip?
Was that a paper clip?

599
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:34,690
It was.
I had to find something...

600
00:38:34,857 --> 00:38:37,359
...to draw the nervous energy
away from my heart.

601
00:38:37,526 --> 00:38:39,236
Like a....

602
00:38:39,403 --> 00:38:42,614
-Like a lightning rod?
-Like a lightning rod. Exactly.

603
00:38:42,781 --> 00:38:44,783
All the energy
goes into the paper clip.

604
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:47,077
And then what's left is....

605
00:38:47,286 --> 00:38:48,745
Your speech.

606
00:38:48,912 --> 00:38:51,790
Yeah, a smooth,
and I’d like to think...

607
00:38:51,957 --> 00:38:54,585
...very compelling speech.

608
00:38:56,336 --> 00:38:58,422
Some of the best speakers
in history...

609
00:38:59,673 --> 00:39:01,508
...a paper clip.

610
00:39:02,009 --> 00:39:04,219
Let me see, Henry Kissinger.

611
00:39:04,761 --> 00:39:06,889
He wasn't known
for his speaking abilities.

612
00:39:07,055 --> 00:39:09,516
No, he wasn't, was he?

613
00:39:11,852 --> 00:39:15,230
Well, imagine what he would've
been like without the:

614
00:39:16,273 --> 00:39:19,109
-He would've really sucked.
-He would've what?

615
00:39:19,276 --> 00:39:20,944
-Really sucked.
-Right.

616
00:39:22,654 --> 00:39:24,865
So maybe you'll try again?

617
00:39:27,284 --> 00:39:29,703
Hey, Ma,
can we go see the penguins?

618
00:39:31,747 --> 00:39:35,042
-Let's go see penguins.
-Five minutes.

619
00:39:37,294 --> 00:39:39,630
-You're a bad influence.
-I am?

620
00:39:39,796 --> 00:39:41,298
Hurry up!

621
00:39:48,055 --> 00:39:49,473
Look at this guy go.

622
00:39:52,392 --> 00:39:53,727
They're so funny.

623
00:39:53,894 --> 00:39:57,356
They look like little, fat,
short guys with tuxedos.

624
00:39:57,564 --> 00:40:00,901
Speaking of fat guys in tuxedos,
there's this thing Monday night.

625
00:40:01,068 --> 00:40:05,614
It’s a black-tie.
It’s a $2500-a-plate dinner.

626
00:40:05,781 --> 00:40:09,910
-Oh, my God. $2500 per plate?
-$2500 a plate.

627
00:40:10,077 --> 00:40:13,539
-I hope you get to keep the plate.
-You can if you want.

628
00:40:14,414 --> 00:40:15,541
What is it for?

629
00:40:15,707 --> 00:40:18,836
For the inner-city literacy campaign,
something I support.

630
00:40:19,002 --> 00:40:22,047
It’s a big benefit that Maddox
throws every year.

631
00:40:22,214 --> 00:40:26,552
It’s not quite as boring as it sounds.
I don't know, are you interested?

632
00:40:27,678 --> 00:40:31,890
Wait a minute. Isn't that the guy who
hired Yatter to get pictures of you?

633
00:40:32,099 --> 00:40:33,433
Yes, it is.

634
00:40:34,017 --> 00:40:35,727
I don't get it.
Why would you go?

635
00:40:35,894 --> 00:40:40,399
I go because-- I go--
It’s exposure.

636
00:40:41,066 --> 00:40:43,944
Won't everyone know you're there
just to expose yourself?

637
00:40:44,111 --> 00:40:47,239
Well, I kind of
have to expose myself.

638
00:40:47,406 --> 00:40:50,576
-When you put it that way--
-I didn't. You put it that way.

639
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:53,328
I don't care how much
you pay for dinner.

640
00:40:53,495 --> 00:40:56,707
You shouldn't serve yourself up,
no matter what the cause.

641
00:40:56,874 --> 00:40:59,459
So why don't you tell me
what you really think.

642
00:40:59,626 --> 00:41:02,212
You really want me
to tell you what I think?

643
00:41:02,379 --> 00:41:07,050
lf Mr. Wanton Maddox, or whatever
his name is, really wants to help...

644
00:41:07,217 --> 00:41:10,721
...why doesn't he give the $2500
per plate to the inner-city schools?

645
00:41:10,888 --> 00:41:13,807
And eat a little bit lighter that night,
you know?

646
00:41:14,391 --> 00:41:17,853
So why don't you come with me
and tell him yourself.

647
00:41:18,896 --> 00:41:20,522
Monday...

648
00:41:20,689 --> 00:41:22,774
...I’m busy. Sorry.

649
00:41:23,066 --> 00:41:27,488
You're busy, you can't?
What? Can you change it?

650
00:41:27,696 --> 00:41:29,740
It’s complicated.

651
00:41:30,657 --> 00:41:34,328
Which reminds me, I gotta get
out of here. Come on, we gotta go.

652
00:41:34,495 --> 00:41:37,956
-We gotta go. We're gonna be late.
-Do we have to?

653
00:41:39,833 --> 00:41:42,294
-I gotta get back.
-Caroline.

654
00:41:42,836 --> 00:41:46,673
This can't be it. Come on,
we haven't seen the snakes.

655
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:48,842
Except for Yatter.

656
00:41:50,135 --> 00:41:53,889
It was nice meeting you,
Chris Marshall.

657
00:41:59,770 --> 00:42:01,897
We're late. We gotta go.
Come on.

658
00:42:02,064 --> 00:42:03,857
Here, Ty....

659
00:42:04,817 --> 00:42:07,903
-Don't use them all on one speech.
-I won't.

660
00:42:08,946 --> 00:42:12,533
-Keep up the good voting record.
-I’ll do my best.

661
00:42:18,247 --> 00:42:20,707
”It’s complicated.”
What kind of answer is that?

662
00:42:20,874 --> 00:42:22,167
Honest.

663
00:42:22,334 --> 00:42:26,004
The only thing complicated between
me and him would be my bra strap.

664
00:42:26,171 --> 00:42:29,925
Look, what am I supposed to do?
Make his bed with me in it?

665
00:42:30,092 --> 00:42:31,176
Get real!

666
00:42:31,385 --> 00:42:34,346
-He thinks I’m a guest here.
-All right. All right.

667
00:42:34,513 --> 00:42:37,015
But just tell me what he was like.

668
00:42:37,724 --> 00:42:40,352
Sexy eyes.

669
00:42:40,561 --> 00:42:42,521
And nice lips.

670
00:42:42,688 --> 00:42:45,691
What about the hands?
Were they big?

671
00:42:51,071 --> 00:42:54,658
-They were perfect.
-Perfect works.

672
00:42:54,825 --> 00:42:56,577
-Marisa!
-Who? What?

673
00:42:56,743 --> 00:43:00,205
-Marisa Ventura, are you back there?
-Oh, my God, it's Paula!

674
00:43:11,508 --> 00:43:13,719
What are you doing?

675
00:43:13,927 --> 00:43:16,638
I just....
I spilled something on my apron...

676
00:43:16,805 --> 00:43:20,017
...so I was cleaning it,
and she was helping me tie it.

677
00:43:20,184 --> 00:43:22,853
Mr. Bextrum wants to see you
in his office right now.

678
00:43:29,776 --> 00:43:31,320
Oh, shit!

679
00:43:34,781 --> 00:43:38,285
Look who's here.
Let's review the last hour, okay?

680
00:43:38,452 --> 00:43:42,289
Delgado killed while you were
out walking that goddamn dog.

681
00:43:42,456 --> 00:43:45,584
-You got a pen that works?
-Sure. Here you go.

682
00:43:45,792 --> 00:43:48,754
-Anything else I can do for you?
-No, that's good, thanks.

683
00:43:48,921 --> 00:43:51,381
Get this note to the woman
in the Park Suite.

684
00:43:51,548 --> 00:43:54,134
Her name is Caroline.

685
00:43:54,301 --> 00:43:56,303
-Can you handle that for me?
-Certainly.

686
00:43:56,470 --> 00:43:59,431
-Thank you.
-Who's Caroline in the Park Suite?

687
00:43:59,598 --> 00:44:02,100
Someone I met.
You wanted me to have an escort...

688
00:44:02,267 --> 00:44:04,561
...for that Maddox literacy thing
on Monday night.

689
00:44:04,728 --> 00:44:08,816
But I was thinking more of a blind,
ex-illiterate senior citizen who learned...

690
00:44:08,982 --> 00:44:12,486
-...to read while fighting Nazis.
-I thought your mother was in Florida.

691
00:44:12,653 --> 00:44:16,114
Just make sure she's not married,
on medication...

692
00:44:16,281 --> 00:44:18,283
...or a Democrat.
Did you check, or--?

693
00:44:18,492 --> 00:44:19,451
Rufus.

694
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:22,871
Sure, okay, great.
Can I talk to you for a second?

695
00:44:23,038 --> 00:44:26,416
I want you to find out who
Caroline is in the Park Suite.

696
00:44:26,583 --> 00:44:28,794
Don't write it down.
Just remember it.

697
00:44:28,961 --> 00:44:30,337
Thanks. Good job.

698
00:44:40,347 --> 00:44:42,641
Come in, Miss Ventura.

699
00:44:45,644 --> 00:44:49,314
I assume you know the reason
you've been called here.

700
00:44:49,481 --> 00:44:51,692
I think so. Yes, sir.

701
00:44:52,693 --> 00:44:56,947
Do you know what the foundation
of a great hotel is?

702
00:45:00,242 --> 00:45:01,618
Location?

703
00:45:01,952 --> 00:45:05,164
Loyalty and trust.

704
00:45:05,372 --> 00:45:08,876
Would you say those are qualities
that you possess?

705
00:45:09,042 --> 00:45:10,586
I would. Yes, sir.

706
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:15,591
Miss Burns agrees.

707
00:45:15,757 --> 00:45:17,885
And she's urged me
to consider you.

708
00:45:18,385 --> 00:45:20,888
We had no idea you were
interested in management...

709
00:45:21,054 --> 00:45:24,057
...until Miss Kehoe brought us
your application.

710
00:45:24,808 --> 00:45:28,478
By the way, you forgot
your social security number...

711
00:45:28,645 --> 00:45:31,064
...and your mother's maiden name.

712
00:45:31,231 --> 00:45:35,569
lf you just fill them in
and sign right there. Perfect.

713
00:45:35,736 --> 00:45:39,990
Normally, you'd go through the program
and train for a year as a butler, but--

714
00:45:40,157 --> 00:45:43,577
-Given the circumstances--
-Due to overbooking and understaffing...

715
00:45:43,744 --> 00:45:46,038
...we decided to accelerate
your application.

716
00:45:46,205 --> 00:45:49,374
And move you into management
after the six-week training.

717
00:45:49,583 --> 00:45:51,960
With the proviso that you
pass the practical exam...

718
00:45:52,127 --> 00:45:54,922
...and fulfil each requirement
for every station.

719
00:45:55,088 --> 00:45:57,883
So you see, Miss Ventura,
sometimes...

720
00:45:58,050 --> 00:46:02,596
...when life shuts one door,
it opens a window.

721
00:46:03,514 --> 00:46:05,224
So jump.

722
00:46:08,936 --> 00:46:11,855
Steph, where are you?
I know you're in here.

723
00:46:12,898 --> 00:46:16,109
-Don't tell me you're busted.
-No, you are.

724
00:46:16,276 --> 00:46:18,862
You know what?
You had no right!

725
00:46:19,029 --> 00:46:20,405
What are you talking about?

726
00:46:20,697 --> 00:46:22,741
You filled out
an application for me?

727
00:46:23,909 --> 00:46:26,703
-They're considering you.
-Do you know what you've done?

728
00:46:26,870 --> 00:46:29,748
-I did you a favour.
-No. lf you wanna do me a favour...

729
00:46:29,915 --> 00:46:32,334
...then mind your own business
once in a while.

730
00:46:32,501 --> 00:46:35,796
For two years, you've yapped
about getting out of uniform...

731
00:46:35,963 --> 00:46:37,464
...and what ideas you got.

732
00:46:37,631 --> 00:46:41,093
This morning, I’m having coffee
with Rosalie from personnel...

733
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:43,637
...and I ask her.
I go, “Marisa got a shot?”

734
00:46:43,804 --> 00:46:46,682
She goes, “Marisa who?”
I go, “Marisa Ventura. She's applied.”

735
00:46:46,849 --> 00:46:50,018
She goes, “lf she applied,
I’d slip it to the top of the pile.”

736
00:46:50,185 --> 00:46:53,647
So I just act real nonchalant-like
and I go, “Are you sure?”

737
00:46:53,814 --> 00:46:56,483
So she goes, she double-checks,
and she tells me:

738
00:46:56,650 --> 00:47:01,196
”Marisa Ventura ain't never applied
for no management program ever.”

739
00:47:01,363 --> 00:47:04,283
Imagine my shock and dismay.

740
00:47:04,449 --> 00:47:06,326
My own partner,
lying to me like that.

741
00:47:06,493 --> 00:47:10,164
Then I figured maybe you were
too chicken shit, so I did it myself.

742
00:47:10,330 --> 00:47:11,957
lf they took you,
you'd be happy.

743
00:47:12,124 --> 00:47:15,502
And if they didn't, you wouldn't know
the difference. So sue me!

744
00:47:15,669 --> 00:47:18,714
These are the golden years.
We gotta prove our mothers wrong.

745
00:47:18,881 --> 00:47:20,883
Don't waste them.

746
00:47:35,856 --> 00:47:38,025
What we did today was wrong.

747
00:47:38,192 --> 00:47:41,111
But you didn't really lie.
Not technically.

748
00:47:41,278 --> 00:47:43,238
Now you're starting
to sound like Nixon.

749
00:47:43,405 --> 00:47:45,449
Letting someone believe
something's true when it's not...

750
00:47:45,616 --> 00:47:47,409
...is just as much
a lie as a lie is.

751
00:47:47,576 --> 00:47:51,330
I let him think I was staying in the
suite, not cleaning it. I’m the maid.

752
00:47:51,497 --> 00:47:55,375
I hate to break it to you,
but I don't think he's after your money.

753
00:47:56,043 --> 00:47:58,712
I can't believe you just said that!

754
00:47:59,838 --> 00:48:03,342
Just get my keys in my pocket,
please. This is hot.

755
00:48:27,950 --> 00:48:29,535
Good job.

756
00:48:30,118 --> 00:48:33,914
All right, sweetie.
Behave yourself, okay?

757
00:48:34,414 --> 00:48:36,875
-Thank you.
-My pleasure.

758
00:48:40,712 --> 00:48:42,089
Can I borrow this?

759
00:48:42,256 --> 00:48:44,007
-Of course.
-Thank you.

760
00:48:44,174 --> 00:48:45,717
Baby, bye.

761
00:48:45,926 --> 00:48:47,845
And remember,
all security IDs...

762
00:48:48,011 --> 00:48:50,722
...will need to be re-photographed
starting next week.

763
00:48:50,889 --> 00:48:53,308
I think that's all.
Thank you very much.

764
00:48:53,475 --> 00:48:56,436
Barbara, Clarice,
come with me, please.

765
00:49:03,777 --> 00:49:06,071
-Have you seen this?
-No. What?

766
00:49:06,238 --> 00:49:08,031
Well, let me show you.

767
00:49:08,198 --> 00:49:09,741
Give me this.

768
00:49:10,325 --> 00:49:12,953
Yeah. So?

769
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:16,623
What do you mean, “so”? What if
somebody from the hotel sees it?

770
00:49:16,790 --> 00:49:19,585
I hate to break the bubble.
You can't tell it's you.

771
00:49:19,751 --> 00:49:22,921
-Don't worry about it.
-It’s the front page of the paper today.

772
00:49:23,088 --> 00:49:26,925
Stop. You do one spontaneous thing,
you think you're going to hell.

773
00:49:27,092 --> 00:49:29,136
Do you understand
this could be bad?

774
00:49:29,303 --> 00:49:32,431
Don't be such a Catholic. Please.
Come on.

775
00:49:38,270 --> 00:49:40,022
Good morning.
Nice to see you.

776
00:49:40,189 --> 00:49:42,274
-Can I steal him away for a second?
-Sure.

777
00:49:42,483 --> 00:49:45,319
-Let me steal you away.
-Excuse me.

778
00:49:45,944 --> 00:49:48,280
-I want to talk to you.
-What's the problem?

779
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:51,325
This! Do you know
what this is gonna cost me?

780
00:49:51,492 --> 00:49:54,661
An entire day of doing nothing
but covering your ass.

781
00:49:54,828 --> 00:49:57,915
I’m getting calls from The London
Times, The Washington Post...

782
00:49:58,081 --> 00:50:01,293
...the Chicago Sun, asking
about her identity, her background...

783
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:04,254
...who the kid is. A kid!

784
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:09,468
Just when I get them to focus on your
assets, they're focusing on hers.

785
00:50:09,635 --> 00:50:10,802
Thanks.

786
00:50:11,011 --> 00:50:14,932
Yeah, well, they're fantastic assets,
don't you think?

787
00:50:21,188 --> 00:50:27,152
Squeezing the circle
tighter and tighter and tighter...

788
00:50:27,319 --> 00:50:30,489
...and release.
Let's try that again.

789
00:50:30,697 --> 00:50:35,160
And squeeze the circle
tighter, tighter...

790
00:50:35,327 --> 00:50:38,997
-...and relax.
-Sorry, I’ll come back.

791
00:50:40,082 --> 00:50:42,167
That's okay.
You can work around us.

792
00:50:42,376 --> 00:50:45,546
We could use some more towels,
por favour. Rapido.

793
00:50:45,712 --> 00:50:48,924
Squeezing the circle tighter...

794
00:50:49,091 --> 00:50:52,010
...and tighter and tighter.

795
00:50:52,177 --> 00:50:54,388
Radiating from the pelvis.

796
00:50:54,596 --> 00:50:57,641
Good. Breathe.

797
00:50:57,808 --> 00:50:59,601
Exhale.

798
00:50:59,768 --> 00:51:01,395
Are you all right?

799
00:51:02,229 --> 00:51:06,066
Twinkles, is it Eric?
I knew it.

800
00:51:08,569 --> 00:51:10,696
He hasn't called once.

801
00:51:10,904 --> 00:51:13,615
Not my cell, not the service,
not the hotel.

802
00:51:13,949 --> 00:51:19,580
So last night I called him, and--
Rach, he was with....

803
00:51:19,746 --> 00:51:25,288
I can't. It’s like cheap wine.

804
00:51:25,583 --> 00:51:28,878
-Shall we do some band work, ladies?
-Go on, I’m listening.

805
00:51:29,045 --> 00:51:31,798
-I heard her in the background.
-The cheap wine?

806
00:51:31,964 --> 00:51:35,426
His ex, in mid-laugh.

807
00:51:35,677 --> 00:51:37,011
Butler service, Miss Lane.

808
00:51:38,262 --> 00:51:41,516
I have a message
from Mr. Christopher Marshall.

809
00:51:41,683 --> 00:51:43,851
Christopher Marshall?

810
00:51:44,018 --> 00:51:46,437
As in, Christopher Marshall?

811
00:51:47,605 --> 00:51:50,692
He's staying in the York Suite
and was wondering...

812
00:51:50,858 --> 00:51:53,194
...if you had a response
to the luncheon invitation...

813
00:51:53,361 --> 00:51:55,863
...l placed in your room yesterday.

814
00:51:56,072 --> 00:51:58,741
-We're through. Thank you.
-In my room?

815
00:51:58,950 --> 00:52:01,119
-I have to charge the full hour.
-Yesterday.

816
00:52:01,285 --> 00:52:02,412
-Fine.
-For lunch?

817
00:52:02,578 --> 00:52:04,080
-For two.
-Get out!

818
00:52:04,247 --> 00:52:06,040
-Where?
-In his suite.

819
00:52:06,874 --> 00:52:08,751
This is a miracle.

820
00:52:09,961 --> 00:52:13,715
-Shall I give him an answer?
-Yes. Tell him yes. What time?

821
00:52:13,881 --> 00:52:16,509
-1 p.m.
-She'll be there. Thank you.

822
00:52:16,676 --> 00:52:18,261
When did this go down?

823
00:52:18,428 --> 00:52:21,514
We met at this thing
in Southampton last summer.

824
00:52:21,681 --> 00:52:24,434
I thought we had a moment.

825
00:52:24,642 --> 00:52:26,686
”Can you steal away an hour,
please?”

826
00:52:26,853 --> 00:52:31,065
-You think he saw you in the hall?
-Who cares? What should I wear?

827
00:52:31,232 --> 00:52:33,276
You look good in anything.

828
00:52:33,443 --> 00:52:35,528
But I didn't bring a thing!

829
00:52:35,695 --> 00:52:36,946
Let's see.

830
00:52:40,658 --> 00:52:44,037
Maria, thank goodness.
I need a favour. It’s urgent.

831
00:52:44,203 --> 00:52:47,540
Could you get those outfits
you returned for me yesterday?

832
00:52:47,707 --> 00:52:50,543
There's this divine
Dolce cashmere coat. It’s just--

833
00:52:50,710 --> 00:52:55,214
Actually, they're still in the closet.
I thought you might want a second look.

834
00:52:55,798 --> 00:52:58,801
You are so good.
Thank God!

835
00:52:59,010 --> 00:53:02,347
-You should be a personal assistant.
-She's a maid.

836
00:53:02,513 --> 00:53:07,477
-So are they, with better titles.
-Actually, I’m up for a position.

837
00:53:07,643 --> 00:53:09,395
What do you think?

838
00:53:09,896 --> 00:53:11,939
Dolce coat, Gucci pants...

839
00:53:12,106 --> 00:53:14,984
...or Ralph Lauren skirt,
Manolo pumps?

840
00:53:15,151 --> 00:53:17,320
They're both divine!
Let's see.

841
00:53:17,528 --> 00:53:20,323
How about the pants, open sandals,
see-through blouse...

842
00:53:20,490 --> 00:53:23,076
...coloured bra and carry
the Dolce coat for effect.

843
00:53:23,409 --> 00:53:27,038
-Maria?
-She barely speaks English.

844
00:53:28,956 --> 00:53:31,167
-What?
-Excuse me?

845
00:53:31,334 --> 00:53:34,212
Maria, what do you think?

846
00:53:35,129 --> 00:53:37,340
What about the beaded skirt
with that beige...

847
00:53:37,507 --> 00:53:39,884
...crocheted halter
you have in the closet?

848
00:53:40,051 --> 00:53:42,387
You know, casual sexy.
No stockings.

849
00:53:42,553 --> 00:53:45,181
Definitely eighty-six the coat.
It sends the wrong message.

850
00:53:45,348 --> 00:53:46,974
Like you're going someplace.

851
00:53:47,141 --> 00:53:51,104
Besides, that whole see-through
blouse, coloured-bra thing...

852
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:56,359
...reads a little desperate, older gal,
trying too hard. Don't you think?

853
00:53:58,194 --> 00:54:00,571
You want to make him work for it.

854
00:54:00,905 --> 00:54:03,658
Who does she think she is
to talk to me like that?

855
00:54:03,825 --> 00:54:05,535
Thank you, Maria.

856
00:54:05,702 --> 00:54:09,872
I have two words for you,
Rachel Hoffberg: Eric who?

857
00:54:11,499 --> 00:54:14,085
Excuse me. Sorry.

858
00:54:16,504 --> 00:54:18,256
Yes, that's it.

859
00:54:18,423 --> 00:54:22,093
All handles parallel
with the right elbow.

860
00:54:26,139 --> 00:54:29,934
Review your protocols
for table setting and wine service.

861
00:54:30,101 --> 00:54:33,313
We're serving lunch
at the York Suite today.

862
00:54:45,533 --> 00:54:47,952
Butler service, Mr. Marshall.

863
00:54:48,119 --> 00:54:49,412
Come on in.

864
00:54:49,579 --> 00:54:52,373
Rufus, it's okay.
Thank you.

865
00:55:30,161 --> 00:55:33,373
Water glasses 3 inches east
of the wine goblets.

866
00:55:33,539 --> 00:55:36,167
-Make a perfect triangle.
-Yes, sir.

867
00:55:47,011 --> 00:55:48,971
Hold on, I’m coming.

868
00:55:53,184 --> 00:55:56,813
You're an animal lover too!
So am l.

869
00:55:57,522 --> 00:56:00,650
I just can't get enough of them.

870
00:56:01,943 --> 00:56:05,655
What a wonderful idea.
Lunch à deux. Lovely!

871
00:56:06,781 --> 00:56:10,827
I just knew that we made
a connection at the...

872
00:56:10,994 --> 00:56:13,454
...Feathered Friends Tournament.

873
00:56:16,374 --> 00:56:18,418
Look!

874
00:56:20,628 --> 00:56:23,339
How sweet of you to remember.

875
00:56:24,507 --> 00:56:28,386
But I hope you didn't think
I needed reminding.

876
00:56:30,805 --> 00:56:33,683
Teddy Parrish sends you his best.

877
00:56:33,850 --> 00:56:34,976
Oh, Teddy.

878
00:56:35,268 --> 00:56:37,353
Right. Yeah.

879
00:56:38,062 --> 00:56:39,063
How is Teddy?

880
00:56:39,230 --> 00:56:41,899
Drinking again,
but you didn't hear it from me.

881
00:56:42,066 --> 00:56:44,027
Excuse me,
I gotta check on something.

882
00:56:44,193 --> 00:56:45,903
Of course.

883
00:56:49,741 --> 00:56:52,702
Who is that over there?

884
00:56:53,328 --> 00:56:55,288
Caroline Lane.

885
00:56:56,748 --> 00:56:59,292
No. No, it's not her.

886
00:56:59,459 --> 00:57:01,002
-It’s not her?
-No.

887
00:57:02,795 --> 00:57:04,547
The Maddox thing.

888
00:57:05,673 --> 00:57:08,551
-Are you going?
-Of course.

889
00:57:09,052 --> 00:57:12,305
You know who I can't figure out
where I know them from?

890
00:57:12,472 --> 00:57:14,432
The woman visiting you
the other day...

891
00:57:14,599 --> 00:57:18,561
...kind of Mediterranean,
with a little boy about 10.

892
00:57:18,728 --> 00:57:22,357
Rachel Hoffberg, Mediterranean?
She's from Westport.

893
00:57:22,690 --> 00:57:27,028
She's pre-menopausal,
but don't tell her I said so.

894
00:57:27,945 --> 00:57:31,157
You're staying in the Park Suite,
right, Caroline?

895
00:57:31,324 --> 00:57:34,327
Yes. Yes, I am.

896
00:57:35,536 --> 00:57:36,829
Good.

897
00:57:36,996 --> 00:57:40,249
Well, it's the damnedest thing.

898
00:57:51,427 --> 00:57:53,930
This salmon is perfect.

899
00:57:54,222 --> 00:57:58,559
Your whole presentation today
has been excellent. Well done.

900
00:57:58,726 --> 00:58:00,269
Thank you.

901
00:58:00,478 --> 00:58:02,897
Make sure you tuck it in tightly.

902
00:58:03,398 --> 00:58:06,943
She's about 5'6”, dark hair,
really beautiful, has a kid named Ty.

903
00:58:07,110 --> 00:58:08,903
What the hell happened?

904
00:58:09,070 --> 00:58:12,281
-I’m sorry, sir.
-Don't be sorry. Just find her.

905
00:58:12,490 --> 00:58:15,034
Chris, I loved your quote
in The Times.

906
00:58:15,201 --> 00:58:17,036
Please!

907
00:58:28,756 --> 00:58:32,427
We're all here to try to land
the Rothford Estate. It’s worth zillions.

908
00:58:32,802 --> 00:58:36,347
And Sotheby's are counting on me
to lock the whole thing up.

909
00:58:36,514 --> 00:58:38,725
-Thank you so much.
-Really?

910
00:58:38,891 --> 00:58:40,852
Rufus, come here.

911
00:58:41,019 --> 00:58:42,353
Thank you.

912
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:43,730
Sit. Sit.

913
00:58:43,896 --> 00:58:47,358
Maria, could I have a little water,
please?

914
00:58:47,942 --> 00:58:50,653
-Good boy.
-Such a sweet dog.

915
00:58:50,820 --> 00:58:51,821
Allow me.

916
00:58:52,655 --> 00:58:55,283
-That will be all.
-You know Nettie Rothford.

917
00:58:55,450 --> 00:58:56,701
Sure.

918
00:58:56,909 --> 00:58:58,786
She and I virtually grew up together.

919
00:58:58,953 --> 00:59:02,498
Her place was bang
next to Daddy's on the Vineyard.

920
00:59:07,962 --> 00:59:09,964
-Right there.
-Good evening.

921
00:59:10,131 --> 00:59:12,508
Another interesting day now,
huh, Marisa?

922
00:59:12,675 --> 00:59:16,137
-I don't know. Was it?
-You tell me.

923
00:59:16,304 --> 00:59:17,930
Nice lunch?

924
00:59:19,057 --> 00:59:21,267
All right, what's up, mystery man?

925
00:59:21,434 --> 00:59:24,228
How many times you watched
the monitors with me?

926
00:59:24,395 --> 00:59:28,149
How many times we enjoyed
the comings and goings?

927
00:59:28,316 --> 00:59:29,317
Thousands.

928
00:59:29,484 --> 00:59:33,404
You know what?
You over there, nosy body.

929
00:59:33,571 --> 00:59:37,116
You know I’m beholden
to report employees misbehaving.

930
00:59:38,493 --> 00:59:43,665
And there's only one thing
could make me shut my mouth.

931
00:59:50,088 --> 00:59:52,215
You dirty old man.

932
00:59:54,926 --> 00:59:57,720
You're in trouble.
What are you laughing at?

933
00:59:58,137 --> 01:00:01,349
About the silver soap dishes....

934
01:00:01,516 --> 01:00:03,351
Rach, darling, I’ll just be a sec.

935
01:00:03,518 --> 01:00:06,646
-Hi, I’m Caroline Lane--
-In the Park Suite, yes.

936
01:00:06,813 --> 01:00:10,066
-I called about a ticket to the--
-Benefit. Monday night.

937
01:00:10,274 --> 01:00:14,862
We were able to procure you a single
at a table adjacent to Mr. Marshall's.

938
01:00:15,029 --> 01:00:17,573
Fantastic! And how much will that be?

939
01:00:17,782 --> 01:00:19,909
-Three thousand dollars.
-What?

940
01:00:20,118 --> 01:00:22,620
The rates are raised
when a couple is split.

941
01:00:22,787 --> 01:00:24,831
Singles are always harder to place.

942
01:00:24,998 --> 01:00:29,168
Well, I mean what is it?
Is it on the internet I’m an ex-couple?

943
01:00:29,335 --> 01:00:31,879
I mean, does the whole hotel know?

944
01:00:32,046 --> 01:00:36,259
Is there a Biblical sign on my forehead?
”Unmarried, unclean”?

945
01:00:36,426 --> 01:00:40,430
Do I bear the scarlet letter? I’m....

946
01:00:40,638 --> 01:00:41,597
I’m....

947
01:00:41,806 --> 01:00:44,726
I’m just....
Sorry. l....

948
01:00:44,892 --> 01:00:46,811
I’m better now.

949
01:00:46,978 --> 01:00:49,355
Just charge it to my room.

950
01:00:49,522 --> 01:00:50,815
Yes, ma'am.

951
01:00:50,982 --> 01:00:53,943
Come on, Rach. Ghastly man!

952
01:00:54,110 --> 01:00:56,571
I am terrified to ask
what that was about.

953
01:00:56,738 --> 01:00:58,948
I think, being dumped.

954
01:00:59,157 --> 01:01:02,285
-Can I get your autograph?
-Amber? Is that your name?

955
01:01:02,452 --> 01:01:04,620
-Amber's your name.
-How you doing?

956
01:01:04,829 --> 01:01:08,708
Get in the car! Get in the car!

957
01:01:10,043 --> 01:01:13,504
-Did she see us?
-Yeah. No. You're fine. All's clear.

958
01:01:13,671 --> 01:01:15,673
-It’s fine.
-How did this happen?

959
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:18,009
I think she's very attractive.

960
01:01:18,176 --> 01:01:21,304
I had her checked out.
She comes from a family with money...

961
01:01:21,471 --> 01:01:23,931
...politically neutral and
has no naked pictures.

962
01:01:24,098 --> 01:01:26,184
That woman wasn't
the woman I wanted.

963
01:01:26,351 --> 01:01:29,395
I don't know what to say.
I talked to the hotel manager.

964
01:01:29,562 --> 01:01:33,232
That's the only Caroline Lane
staying in the Park Suite.

965
01:01:33,399 --> 01:01:35,735
Wait. There she is.

966
01:01:36,152 --> 01:01:38,071
That's her. Cordell, pull over.

967
01:01:42,492 --> 01:01:45,495
-Hey, wait! Ty! Caroline!
-Hey, Chris!

968
01:01:45,703 --> 01:01:48,206
-Hey. How's it going, Ty?
-Okay.

969
01:01:48,373 --> 01:01:49,707
-How you doing?
-Good.

970
01:01:49,874 --> 01:01:53,878
You want to hear something strange?
I invited you to lunch, and you came...

971
01:01:54,045 --> 01:01:55,296
...only it wasn't you.

972
01:01:55,838 --> 01:01:57,840
So, what happened?

973
01:01:58,049 --> 01:02:02,595
-I don't know what you mean.
-Are you still staying at the Beresford?

974
01:02:02,762 --> 01:02:06,766
No, we actually moved uptown.
You know, uptown.

975
01:02:06,933 --> 01:02:09,686
Hop in. We're going
to the Tremont Housing Projects.

976
01:02:09,852 --> 01:02:12,855
-We can drop you at the Upper East?
-Yeah, Mom!

977
01:02:13,064 --> 01:02:17,527
No. Remember, we're going to a party
just a few blocks away, so we'll walk.

978
01:02:17,735 --> 01:02:20,321
-So how do I get a hold of you?
-Her cell's 9-1-7--

979
01:02:20,989 --> 01:02:22,657
How about I call you?

980
01:02:22,824 --> 01:02:25,994
lf you want to get in touch with him,
call this number.

981
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:28,955
That's my card.
What's your last name, hon?

982
01:02:29,122 --> 01:02:31,624
-Ventura. What's yours?
-Spanish?

983
01:02:31,791 --> 01:02:35,128
-Jerry Spanish?
-No, Siegel. We have to go.

984
01:02:35,294 --> 01:02:37,839
-So do we.
-Use that number. Call anytime.

985
01:02:38,006 --> 01:02:39,382
-All right.
-Don't be shy.

986
01:02:39,549 --> 01:02:43,636
-You're late. You have to give a speech.
-In the Bronx?

987
01:02:43,803 --> 01:02:45,888
-On what?
-Housing projects.

988
01:02:46,055 --> 01:02:47,056
Really?

989
01:02:47,765 --> 01:02:50,852
You're telling people
in the Bronx about the projects?

990
01:02:51,019 --> 01:02:53,271
No, I’m just gonna
take the press up there...

991
01:02:53,438 --> 01:02:55,773
...and shine light
on the living conditions.

992
01:02:56,858 --> 01:02:59,610
-Interesting.
-Yeah, we think so. Shall we? Okay?

993
01:02:59,777 --> 01:03:01,654
-Bye.
-What are you not saying?

994
01:03:01,821 --> 01:03:04,073
-Nothing.
-Tell me.

995
01:03:07,035 --> 01:03:10,079
Maybe you should spend
real time in the projects...

996
01:03:10,288 --> 01:03:14,042
...and then you wouldn't have to make up
speeches and memorize them.

997
01:03:14,208 --> 01:03:17,587
You know, it would be coming
from someplace real.

998
01:03:17,754 --> 01:03:20,256
And how would you know? I mean....

999
01:03:20,423 --> 01:03:22,925
Because I grew up there.

1000
01:03:23,134 --> 01:03:26,095
I lived in a four-block radius
my whole life.

1001
01:03:26,304 --> 01:03:28,264
Bye.

1002
01:03:30,808 --> 01:03:33,436
Okay, let's go. Come on.

1003
01:03:35,313 --> 01:03:37,315
-Chris!
-What?

1004
01:03:37,482 --> 01:03:41,778
Shall we? Okay? Let's go.
Gotta go. Gotta go. Gotta go.

1005
01:03:43,988 --> 01:03:45,156
Who the hell is she?

1006
01:03:45,323 --> 01:03:51,245
I’ll tell you who she isn't. She isn't like
anyone I’ve met. And she isn't a phoney.

1007
01:03:51,412 --> 01:03:55,958
I’ll make you a deal. You want me
at the benefit? Then get her to go.

1008
01:03:56,125 --> 01:04:00,213
I swear to God, I’ll shake any
part of Maddox's body you want.

1009
01:04:02,590 --> 01:04:04,467
Deal?

1010
01:04:04,967 --> 01:04:07,136
Deal. All right, sure. Okay.

1011
01:04:14,811 --> 01:04:16,312
Okay, get in.

1012
01:04:21,192 --> 01:04:24,195
So for right now, with the review
and everything going on...

1013
01:04:24,362 --> 01:04:26,656
...we need to be extra careful,
all right?

1014
01:04:26,864 --> 01:04:29,575
That means no coming up
in the elevator to see me.

1015
01:04:29,742 --> 01:04:31,953
And no Chris Marshall.

1016
01:04:32,120 --> 01:04:35,373
-It’s not like you're breaking some law.
-Hey, I mean it.

1017
01:04:35,540 --> 01:04:36,916
lf you see him....

1018
01:04:37,083 --> 01:04:41,879
-I’ll make like a baby and head out first.
-Thank you. Go to bed, okay?

1019
01:04:42,046 --> 01:04:44,924
-Good night, Ma.
-Bye, baby.

1020
01:04:50,388 --> 01:04:51,723
Heads up!

1021
01:04:51,889 --> 01:04:55,018
The Chinese delegation will be
checking into the Lexington Suite.

1022
01:04:55,226 --> 01:04:59,063
Please note the television channel
needs to be set to one of the Chinese....

1023
01:04:59,230 --> 01:05:00,815
Oh, my God. Hide me.

1024
01:05:01,607 --> 01:05:04,736
The Shapiros have requested
an early check-in.

1025
01:05:04,902 --> 01:05:07,113
So we'll put them in the Dior Suite.

1026
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:08,781
Yes, sir?

1027
01:05:08,948 --> 01:05:10,867
-They're in the hall.
-What are they doing?

1028
01:05:11,034 --> 01:05:13,703
-He's got something in his hands.
-Does it look serious?

1029
01:05:13,870 --> 01:05:15,747
Calm down, it's just a letter.

1030
01:05:15,913 --> 01:05:17,874
-Find that girl.
-Certainly.

1031
01:05:18,082 --> 01:05:19,042
-He's coming.
-Be cool.

1032
01:05:19,250 --> 01:05:22,670
He's walking. Get out of here.
He's out of here.

1033
01:05:22,837 --> 01:05:24,797
Thank you very much. That will be all.

1034
01:05:40,897 --> 01:05:43,107
Now....

1035
01:05:43,274 --> 01:05:46,819
Are you truly interested
in management?

1036
01:05:46,986 --> 01:05:49,405
Yes, very much, sir.

1037
01:05:50,281 --> 01:05:55,161
Then I suggest that you go
to the Met tonight...

1038
01:05:55,328 --> 01:06:00,375
...and end all association
with Chris Marshall.

1039
01:06:01,084 --> 01:06:03,169
At least until you're a manager.

1040
01:06:03,628 --> 01:06:05,672
Then you can make your own rules.

1041
01:06:06,422 --> 01:06:08,424
I’ll make sure your shift is covered.

1042
01:06:24,399 --> 01:06:26,067
-Mari.
-What happened?

1043
01:06:26,234 --> 01:06:29,904
-You can still be a manager, right?
-Yeah, if I break it off with Chris.

1044
01:06:30,071 --> 01:06:33,282
Break what off? No offence,
sweetheart. What planet are you on?

1045
01:06:33,491 --> 01:06:35,118
You don't get it. None of you.

1046
01:06:35,326 --> 01:06:37,370
There was something
different about him.

1047
01:06:37,537 --> 01:06:38,788
Yeah, it's called money.

1048
01:06:38,997 --> 01:06:40,957
-No, it's called--
-Don't say, “love.”

1049
01:06:41,165 --> 01:06:43,126
-Don't let her say it.
-She's going to.

1050
01:06:43,334 --> 01:06:45,336
We connected, you know....

1051
01:06:45,503 --> 01:06:48,798
-I felt it. Ty felt it too.
-Snap out of it, all right?

1052
01:06:49,007 --> 01:06:51,801
You are not in love with this man.
He is not in love with you.

1053
01:06:51,968 --> 01:06:54,220
You have no connections,
affiliations or loyalties.

1054
01:06:54,387 --> 01:06:57,390
You're from two different worlds.
Do you hear me?

1055
01:06:57,557 --> 01:06:59,767
-I hear you.
-Me too.

1056
01:06:59,934 --> 01:07:01,519
I don't know.

1057
01:07:01,686 --> 01:07:04,731
Come on, Maris, you....

1058
01:07:04,897 --> 01:07:06,858
You could be manager!

1059
01:07:07,025 --> 01:07:09,819
Think of it, girl. One of us...

1060
01:07:10,028 --> 01:07:11,988
...out there!

1061
01:07:12,196 --> 01:07:13,614
In a blazer.

1062
01:07:13,781 --> 01:07:15,867
Yeah.

1063
01:07:16,868 --> 01:07:19,037
I don't have anything
to wear to this thing.

1064
01:07:19,203 --> 01:07:22,915
-Honey, look, it's not what you got.
-Baby, it's who you know.

1065
01:07:23,082 --> 01:07:25,793
-And what they got.
-You got it?

1066
01:07:25,960 --> 01:07:29,255
When you're a manager, your first
order of business is to get us--

1067
01:07:29,422 --> 01:07:32,008
Raises!

1068
01:08:56,134 --> 01:08:58,052
All right, Ty, focus.

1069
01:08:58,219 --> 01:08:59,679
Eyes forward.

1070
01:08:59,846 --> 01:09:02,849
Once more.
This is the Harry Winston....

1071
01:09:03,016 --> 01:09:05,727
Wreath necklace. Worth more
than I’ll see in 10 lifetimes.

1072
01:09:05,893 --> 01:09:09,605
Good. And if it leaves her neck
at any time, you'll....

1073
01:09:09,814 --> 01:09:13,109
Be put up for adoption
while my mom....

1074
01:09:14,944 --> 01:09:16,821
-Rots in prison!
-Excellent.

1075
01:09:21,492 --> 01:09:23,202
-You want to say hi to Harry?
-Harry.

1076
01:09:23,369 --> 01:09:25,455
What do you need?
Tell me what you need.

1077
01:09:25,663 --> 01:09:26,956
Just your support, Harry.

1078
01:09:27,165 --> 01:09:29,334
What about a cameo
on Saturday Night Live?

1079
01:09:29,500 --> 01:09:31,544
-Let's wait on that.
-I’m calling Lorne.

1080
01:09:31,711 --> 01:09:33,880
-It’s nice to see you.
-Good to see you.

1081
01:09:45,016 --> 01:09:46,809
-There they are. See them?
-I see them.

1082
01:09:47,018 --> 01:09:50,563
We're going to line up Maddox's
support and get Grey's endorsement.

1083
01:09:50,730 --> 01:09:52,273
Just go and get it over with.

1084
01:09:52,440 --> 01:09:56,027
-Is she here?
-She'll be here. She'll be here.

1085
01:09:58,821 --> 01:10:00,657
-Have fun, Ma.
-Thanks.

1086
01:10:00,823 --> 01:10:05,203
Listen, be good. Go to bed when
Steph tells you. No negotiating. Okay?

1087
01:10:05,370 --> 01:10:06,704
Oh, God.

1088
01:10:06,871 --> 01:10:09,082
I can't breathe.

1089
01:10:09,707 --> 01:10:12,251
What am I doing here, Steph?
This is all a lie.

1090
01:10:12,418 --> 01:10:15,046
No, honey.
It’s more like a dream, you know?

1091
01:10:15,213 --> 01:10:17,507
For one night,
you're living it for all of us.

1092
01:10:17,674 --> 01:10:20,551
Don't think about tomorrow.
Just think about tonight.

1093
01:10:20,718 --> 01:10:22,637
Tonight, the maid is a lie.

1094
01:10:22,804 --> 01:10:27,100
And this, this is who you really are.

1095
01:10:51,541 --> 01:10:52,709
What do you think?

1096
01:10:52,917 --> 01:10:55,461
I think we have a lot
of issues to talk about.

1097
01:10:56,170 --> 01:10:57,380
-Let's get together.
-Good.

1098
01:10:57,588 --> 01:11:01,050
Excuse me. I think now's
the perfect time if you'd like to....

1099
01:11:01,259 --> 01:11:03,678
Oh, my God, Jerry.
Look who's here.

1100
01:11:03,845 --> 01:11:07,890
Lovely of you,
but I don't think I’ll be in town.

1101
01:11:08,099 --> 01:11:09,976
I’m gonna bring him over here.

1102
01:11:10,143 --> 01:11:12,562
No. She should be here by now.
She's not coming.

1103
01:11:12,729 --> 01:11:15,857
-She'll be here. She'll be here.
-She'd better be, Jerry.

1104
01:11:53,645 --> 01:11:55,605
You're beautiful.

1105
01:11:56,814 --> 01:11:59,025
So are you.

1106
01:12:03,821 --> 01:12:06,115
Thank you for being here.

1107
01:12:08,951 --> 01:12:12,038
I only came to tell you that this...

1108
01:12:12,205 --> 01:12:15,249
...you and me, can't go
anywhere beyond this evening.

1109
01:12:15,416 --> 01:12:17,043
It just can't.

1110
01:12:18,378 --> 01:12:21,255
Well, then, you should've
worn a different dress.

1111
01:12:26,344 --> 01:12:28,262
Want to dance?

1112
01:12:51,953 --> 01:12:55,123
You have to listen.
I know you're used to getting your way.

1113
01:12:55,289 --> 01:12:57,709
Yeah, until I met you.

1114
01:12:59,544 --> 01:13:02,588
There's millions of women who are
dying for you to look their way.

1115
01:13:02,755 --> 01:13:06,300
Yeah? Then why are you
making me work so hard?

1116
01:13:06,467 --> 01:13:09,137
Chris? Hi.
Maddox is open.

1117
01:13:09,304 --> 01:13:11,431
So why don't you go over,
two minutes.

1118
01:13:11,597 --> 01:13:14,017
-Jerry. I’m here--
-I’ll take over. I know.

1119
01:13:17,270 --> 01:13:20,189
-Oh, Chris. Hi.
-Hello.

1120
01:13:21,733 --> 01:13:25,820
-What a night. I mean, who isn't here?
-Right.

1121
01:13:26,404 --> 01:13:30,408
Do I need to know something
that I don't know already?

1122
01:13:31,367 --> 01:13:35,079
Well, that sounds like something
between you and your God, Jerry.

1123
01:13:35,246 --> 01:13:37,457
I like a good mystery, you know.

1124
01:13:37,623 --> 01:13:40,251
But not where his girlfriends
are concerned.

1125
01:13:40,418 --> 01:13:41,919
I’m not his girlfriend.

1126
01:13:42,086 --> 01:13:44,630
Well, whatever.
I just need him focused.

1127
01:13:44,797 --> 01:13:46,549
-Sorry about that.
-Not at all.

1128
01:13:46,758 --> 01:13:48,384
-May I cut in?
-You certainly may.

1129
01:13:48,593 --> 01:13:52,639
Where were we?
Right about here, wasn't it?

1130
01:13:52,805 --> 01:13:57,060
You better do what you're supposed
to because Jerry thinks I distract you.

1131
01:13:57,268 --> 01:14:02,982
Wait, wait. Never, never start
a sentence with “Jerry thinks.”

1132
01:14:03,149 --> 01:14:06,527
No, but you should do the right thing.

1133
01:14:09,322 --> 01:14:11,282
Why are you smiling?

1134
01:14:11,449 --> 01:14:16,204
Nothing, just until this minute,
I didn't know what that was.

1135
01:14:16,371 --> 01:14:18,289
-But I do now.
-You do what?

1136
01:14:18,456 --> 01:14:20,708
-Don't go anywhere.
-Chris, I didn't mean--

1137
01:14:20,875 --> 01:14:23,878
I’ll be right back.
I’ll be right back.

1138
01:14:46,067 --> 01:14:47,652
Excuse me.

1139
01:14:47,819 --> 01:14:49,862
Excuse me.
Haven't we met?

1140
01:14:50,029 --> 01:14:53,533
-I’m Caroline Lane and you're...?
-Sotheby's Caroline Lane?

1141
01:14:53,700 --> 01:14:55,660
-Yes.
-It’s wonderful to see you again.

1142
01:14:55,827 --> 01:14:59,998
I just knew we knew each other.
I never forget a face. Wow!

1143
01:15:00,164 --> 01:15:02,667
Is that a Harry Winston wreath?

1144
01:15:02,834 --> 01:15:05,628
They haven't made
that design since the late '60s.

1145
01:15:05,795 --> 01:15:08,423
You're very good.
Excuse me, I have to go.

1146
01:15:08,589 --> 01:15:11,551
Listen, just between us girls.

1147
01:15:11,718 --> 01:15:14,679
Are you here with Chris?

1148
01:15:14,846 --> 01:15:17,140
-Can you keep a secret?
-Of course.

1149
01:15:17,348 --> 01:15:20,184
Good. So can l.

1150
01:15:28,693 --> 01:15:30,653
Caroline.

1151
01:15:33,573 --> 01:15:35,533
Caroline.

1152
01:15:38,453 --> 01:15:39,829
Caroline.

1153
01:15:39,996 --> 01:15:42,707
-Do you have somewhere else to be?
-I have to leave.

1154
01:15:42,874 --> 01:15:44,500
You're not leaving. You're running.

1155
01:15:44,709 --> 01:15:47,670
What I can't figure out is, are you
running towards something you want?

1156
01:15:47,837 --> 01:15:51,382
Or are you running away from
something you're afraid to want?

1157
01:15:51,883 --> 01:15:54,218
Look, I’ve made
so many mistakes already.

1158
01:15:54,385 --> 01:15:58,765
-I just don't want to make it worse.
-You won't. I promise.

1159
01:15:59,223 --> 01:16:02,101
There's something
you don't know, okay?

1160
01:16:02,977 --> 01:16:04,604
Oh, God. How do I tell you this?

1161
01:16:05,438 --> 01:16:09,901
-The first time you saw me, I was--
-You were mesmerizing.

1162
01:16:22,830 --> 01:16:25,625
lf tonight is all we have...

1163
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:29,462
...stay. Please.

1164
01:18:14,025 --> 01:18:16,444
It’s over, baby.

1165
01:18:28,373 --> 01:18:30,500
Hi, honey.

1166
01:18:31,125 --> 01:18:33,002
I’m good.

1167
01:18:33,169 --> 01:18:35,338
At work.

1168
01:18:35,546 --> 01:18:40,176
Listen, abuela's gonna be there in about
10 minutes, and I’ll be home at 6.

1169
01:18:40,343 --> 01:18:42,845
Did you and Steph have a good time?

1170
01:18:43,054 --> 01:18:44,639
Yeah?

1171
01:18:59,070 --> 01:19:00,738
What are you gonna do in Buffalo?

1172
01:19:00,905 --> 01:19:04,117
Well, my plan is to sort of
accidentally bump into him.

1173
01:19:04,283 --> 01:19:07,495
-I mean, do you think that's too obvious?
-No.

1174
01:19:11,958 --> 01:19:14,919
-A Harry Winston wreath?
-Morning.

1175
01:19:15,628 --> 01:19:18,381
Isn’t that that maid?

1176
01:19:20,258 --> 01:19:23,386
I mean, where would a maid get
that necklace? I thought maybe--

1177
01:19:23,553 --> 01:19:27,223
I’ll fast-forward through this, and you
just point her out if you see her.

1178
01:19:29,100 --> 01:19:32,312
Oh, wait, could you just
go back on that bit?

1179
01:19:35,356 --> 01:19:39,402
I mean, it could be her.

1180
01:19:39,610 --> 01:19:43,197
Let's just--
Can we just go forward?

1181
01:19:47,118 --> 01:19:49,912
Wait! That's my Dolce coat!

1182
01:19:50,079 --> 01:19:53,416
-How could you have missed that?
-I’m sorry, sir.

1183
01:19:56,294 --> 01:19:58,421
I’ll have maintenance
get there with a plunger.

1184
01:19:58,588 --> 01:20:02,008
And I’ll call the pharmacy to see
if they have something for that.

1185
01:20:02,175 --> 01:20:07,263
Excuse me, sir. Mr. Bextrum wants
to see both of you in the Park Suite.

1186
01:20:29,410 --> 01:20:31,245
Lionel. Marisa.

1187
01:20:31,412 --> 01:20:35,500
Oh. Well, that's interesting.
She told me her name was Maria.

1188
01:20:35,667 --> 01:20:38,461
I thought it would be impolite
to correct you.

1189
01:20:38,628 --> 01:20:41,923
And I suppose you think
it's polite to steal people's clothes?

1190
01:20:44,050 --> 01:20:46,636
-I didn't steal--
-Miss Ventura, Mr. Bextrum has spent...

1191
01:20:46,803 --> 01:20:50,056
...30 minutes trying to persuade
Miss Lane not to press charges.

1192
01:20:50,223 --> 01:20:52,433
I suggest you say as little as possible.

1193
01:20:52,600 --> 01:20:54,435
We have it all on video.

1194
01:20:54,602 --> 01:20:56,270
Was everything returned?

1195
01:20:57,188 --> 01:21:00,066
-Yes, sir.
-Oh, Chris, I’m terribly sorry...

1196
01:21:00,233 --> 01:21:03,569
...to interrupt you. We thought you
should know what was going on.

1197
01:21:03,736 --> 01:21:06,406
-What is going on?
-The woman you thought was a guest...

1198
01:21:06,572 --> 01:21:08,866
...on this floor is the maid on this floor.

1199
01:21:09,033 --> 01:21:10,284
Aren't you, Marisa?

1200
01:21:10,451 --> 01:21:12,662
No. Wait, her name is Caroline.

1201
01:21:12,829 --> 01:21:16,958
No, Chris, darling, that's my name.
She steals clothes, identities--

1202
01:21:17,125 --> 01:21:21,004
What the hell's happening here?
Why are you dressed that way?

1203
01:21:22,338 --> 01:21:24,132
Caroline?

1204
01:21:26,217 --> 01:21:27,844
Is this true?

1205
01:21:34,767 --> 01:21:36,436
Yeah, it is.

1206
01:21:36,894 --> 01:21:40,857
Jesus Christ! The press is gonna
have a field day with this one.

1207
01:21:41,065 --> 01:21:42,900
There's no reason to involve the press.

1208
01:21:43,067 --> 01:21:45,194
How will you prevent her
from speaking?

1209
01:21:45,403 --> 01:21:47,322
This would never happen
at the Four Seasons.

1210
01:21:47,488 --> 01:21:50,533
I can assure you it has never
happened here before either.

1211
01:21:50,742 --> 01:21:54,787
Lionel, you are slipping. You should've
noticed something. I am disappointed.

1212
01:21:54,954 --> 01:21:57,623
Please, Mr. Bextrum,
he had nothing to do with this.

1213
01:21:57,790 --> 01:22:00,293
Of course, sir. I understand.

1214
01:22:00,460 --> 01:22:03,838
We'll talk about this later.
Miss Ventura, you no longer work here.

1215
01:22:04,005 --> 01:22:05,923
Go to security,
hand in your passes...

1216
01:22:06,090 --> 01:22:08,384
...and you'll be escorted
from the building.

1217
01:22:09,927 --> 01:22:12,680
-Yes, sir.
-Is that really necessary?

1218
01:22:12,847 --> 01:22:15,391
Chris, let the man do his job, okay?

1219
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:17,727
Oh, Chris.

1220
01:22:17,894 --> 01:22:22,565
Oh, Chris. I can't help but feel
that this is partly my fault.

1221
01:22:22,732 --> 01:22:24,692
It isn't. Spare yourself.

1222
01:22:24,859 --> 01:22:26,527
At least let me buy you lunch.

1223
01:22:26,694 --> 01:22:30,573
After all, we've only got each other
to get through this humiliation.

1224
01:22:30,740 --> 01:22:35,703
Caroline, the first lunch was a mistake.
A second would be complete torture.

1225
01:22:36,204 --> 01:22:38,247
Drinks, then?

1226
01:22:38,456 --> 01:22:42,377
I need your nametag, passkey
and your ID card.

1227
01:22:42,543 --> 01:22:46,297
-Sorry, Marisa, but I have to.
-I understand.

1228
01:22:47,465 --> 01:22:49,926
God, don't tell me
they fired you over this too.

1229
01:22:50,134 --> 01:22:51,678
No.

1230
01:22:51,844 --> 01:22:55,682
Actually, I made a decision
a moment ago.

1231
01:22:55,848 --> 01:22:57,767
It was long overdue.

1232
01:22:59,435 --> 01:23:01,270
You quit?

1233
01:23:01,479 --> 01:23:03,439
Sometimes...

1234
01:23:03,606 --> 01:23:08,611
...we're forced in directions that we
ought to have found for ourselves.

1235
01:23:09,320 --> 01:23:11,114
Thank you.

1236
01:23:11,489 --> 01:23:14,575
Thanks, Keef. Bye.

1237
01:23:15,201 --> 01:23:17,787
To serve people...

1238
01:23:17,996 --> 01:23:20,623
...takes dignity and intelligence.

1239
01:23:20,790 --> 01:23:24,669
But remember,
they're only people with money.

1240
01:23:24,836 --> 01:23:29,632
And although we serve them,
we are not their servants.

1241
01:23:29,799 --> 01:23:35,305
What we do, Miss Ventura,
does not define who we are.

1242
01:23:35,513 --> 01:23:40,810
What defines us is how
well we rise after falling.

1243
01:23:44,355 --> 01:23:47,650
I think you'll make a wonderful
manager someday.

1244
01:23:50,111 --> 01:23:54,324
And it's been my great honour
to have worked with you.

1245
01:24:12,550 --> 01:24:14,344
Marisa?

1246
01:24:14,510 --> 01:24:17,555
Marisa! Caroline! Marisa!
I don't know which name to use.

1247
01:24:17,722 --> 01:24:19,682
Marisa.

1248
01:24:19,849 --> 01:24:21,643
I don't get it. What just happened?

1249
01:24:21,809 --> 01:24:23,478
What don't you get? I’m the maid.

1250
01:24:23,645 --> 01:24:26,564
What was all this, some kind of bet?

1251
01:24:26,731 --> 01:24:28,650
A little game of what, get-the-guests?

1252
01:24:28,816 --> 01:24:31,277
I was trying on her clothes,
and you were there...

1253
01:24:31,444 --> 01:24:33,655
...and you invited
me out, and everything--

1254
01:24:33,821 --> 01:24:36,491
And you thought you had to lie
to keep me interested?

1255
01:24:36,658 --> 01:24:37,909
Who's kidding who here?

1256
01:24:38,076 --> 01:24:40,995
Think you would've looked at me
if you knew I was the maid?

1257
01:24:41,162 --> 01:24:42,163
-Well....
-Come on.

1258
01:24:42,330 --> 01:24:44,248
With respect for
your big-hearted politics...

1259
01:24:44,415 --> 01:24:47,835
-...l don't think so, Mr. Assemblyman.
-You didn't give me a chance.

1260
01:24:48,002 --> 01:24:52,173
You stand on your soapbox, judging
everyone, so sure they're judging you.

1261
01:24:52,340 --> 01:24:54,050
And you think they're not?

1262
01:24:54,217 --> 01:24:57,136
Come on. Half the time, I’m
a stereotype they make fun of.

1263
01:24:57,303 --> 01:25:00,765
The other half of the time, I’m
invisible. Maybe that's the point.

1264
01:25:00,932 --> 01:25:04,644
The first time you saw me, I was cleaning
your bathroom, only you didn't see me.

1265
01:25:04,811 --> 01:25:07,522
Was I supposed to introduce
myself while taking a leak?

1266
01:25:07,689 --> 01:25:10,108
-You can't nail me for that.
-What are you doing?

1267
01:25:10,274 --> 01:25:11,401
Not now, Jerry. Just--

1268
01:25:11,567 --> 01:25:13,069
-Go.
-You might as well sell tickets.

1269
01:25:13,277 --> 01:25:14,570
-I don't care.
-You care.

1270
01:25:16,489 --> 01:25:19,409
-No. No. No. No.
-Marisa.

1271
01:25:19,575 --> 01:25:21,077
I just want the truth.

1272
01:25:25,206 --> 01:25:27,709
All right, you want the truth?

1273
01:25:30,211 --> 01:25:33,631
There was a part of me
that wanted to see what it felt like...

1274
01:25:33,798 --> 01:25:37,760
...to have someone like you look
at me the way you did, just once.

1275
01:25:40,680 --> 01:25:42,390
And I’m sorry.

1276
01:25:42,557 --> 01:25:44,142
Truly.

1277
01:25:44,309 --> 01:25:47,937
lf I could rewind the past week,
I would.

1278
01:25:50,064 --> 01:25:51,858
Was any of it real?

1279
01:25:54,777 --> 01:25:57,280
Yeah, it was real.

1280
01:25:58,448 --> 01:26:02,285
It was so real it made me wonder
how I was ever gonna give you up.

1281
01:26:05,246 --> 01:26:09,917
But I had to give you up.
That was the plan.

1282
01:26:12,670 --> 01:26:15,048
And then....

1283
01:26:15,214 --> 01:26:17,634
Last night...

1284
01:26:18,968 --> 01:26:21,054
...l couldn't.

1285
01:28:12,081 --> 01:28:16,544
Rosalie from personnel called.
We expected you hours ago.

1286
01:28:16,711 --> 01:28:17,962
Hi, baby.

1287
01:28:18,129 --> 01:28:20,131
She told me what happened.

1288
01:28:20,298 --> 01:28:23,134
Hey, Ma. You okay?

1289
01:28:23,301 --> 01:28:25,428
Scoot over, let me see your homework.

1290
01:28:25,595 --> 01:28:27,055
I don't know what to say.

1291
01:28:27,221 --> 01:28:30,099
What are we gonna do for dinner?
You hungry, sweetie?

1292
01:28:30,266 --> 01:28:32,393
Will you look at me?

1293
01:28:32,560 --> 01:28:35,855
No. I’m gonna take a bath.

1294
01:28:41,861 --> 01:28:43,696
Don't, Mom.

1295
01:28:43,863 --> 01:28:47,367
What were you thinking,
going out with someone like that?

1296
01:28:47,533 --> 01:28:49,077
Someone like what?

1297
01:28:50,495 --> 01:28:52,455
Chris Marshall.

1298
01:28:52,622 --> 01:28:55,416
You had to pretend to be somebody
so he'd go out with you?

1299
01:28:55,583 --> 01:28:58,586
Where is your pride, Marisa?

1300
01:28:58,753 --> 01:29:01,172
People like you make people
like him a God.

1301
01:29:01,339 --> 01:29:04,384
Why, because he's rich? White?
He has things we don't have...

1302
01:29:04,550 --> 01:29:06,469
...that we don't want to dream about?

1303
01:29:06,636 --> 01:29:10,306
It must really burn you that I think
I have the right to go out with him.

1304
01:29:10,515 --> 01:29:12,976
You don't.

1305
01:29:13,267 --> 01:29:16,479
Ty, go to your room
and finish your homework, please.

1306
01:29:19,190 --> 01:29:21,985
-What happened to you?
-Don't speak to me like that.

1307
01:29:22,193 --> 01:29:24,988
I am not the one
who lost her job today.

1308
01:29:25,196 --> 01:29:27,407
No, I did. I messed up.

1309
01:29:27,573 --> 01:29:31,703
Okay? It’s all my fault. You know what?
It’s all right. I’ll be fine.

1310
01:29:31,869 --> 01:29:34,414
You will because
we'll call Señora Rodriguez.

1311
01:29:34,580 --> 01:29:38,960
-She owes me a favour. She has--
-I’m not calling Mrs. Rodriguez.

1312
01:29:39,127 --> 01:29:41,838
I love you, okay? I do.

1313
01:29:42,046 --> 01:29:44,882
But I don't want to clean houses.

1314
01:29:45,049 --> 01:29:47,176
There's nowhere to go from there.

1315
01:29:48,553 --> 01:29:53,850
Hasn't this taught you anything? Wake
up, little girl, you have responsibilities.

1316
01:29:54,017 --> 01:29:57,437
And they come every month
like clockwork.

1317
01:29:57,603 --> 01:29:59,689
You want to end up
back in the projects?

1318
01:29:59,897 --> 01:30:03,693
Keep dreaming dreams
that will never happen.

1319
01:30:03,860 --> 01:30:07,322
You want to put food on the table?
Call Señora Rodriguez.

1320
01:30:11,743 --> 01:30:14,037
You're right, Ma.

1321
01:30:14,245 --> 01:30:16,748
I’m a good cleaning lady.

1322
01:30:17,165 --> 01:30:20,168
I’ll start over.

1323
01:30:20,335 --> 01:30:22,337
But not with Mrs. Rodriguez.

1324
01:30:24,422 --> 01:30:27,592
I’m gonna find a job
as a maid in some hotel.

1325
01:30:27,759 --> 01:30:32,138
After some time passes, I’m gonna
apply for the management program.

1326
01:30:32,305 --> 01:30:35,224
And when I get the chance
to be a manager....

1327
01:30:35,391 --> 01:30:38,895
And I will, Ma. I know I will.

1328
01:30:39,103 --> 01:30:41,814
I’m going to take
that chance without any fear.

1329
01:30:41,981 --> 01:30:45,735
Without your voice
in my head telling me that I can't.

1330
01:30:51,491 --> 01:30:52,575
Did you see this?

1331
01:30:53,910 --> 01:30:56,079
-How did it start?
-Did he know you were a maid?

1332
01:30:56,287 --> 01:30:59,082
-Are you a Beresford perk?
-How long were you involved?

1333
01:30:59,290 --> 01:31:00,583
How did they find you out?

1334
01:31:00,792 --> 01:31:03,169
Any advice to other maids
looking to trade up?

1335
01:31:03,336 --> 01:31:06,047
-Did Democrats put you up to this?
-Does he tip well?

1336
01:31:06,214 --> 01:31:08,424
Is it true you're booked
on Larry King Live?

1337
01:31:08,633 --> 01:31:11,094
I'm at the Beresford Hotel,
where yesterday...

1338
01:31:11,302 --> 01:31:15,098
...Senate hopeful Chris Marshall was
captured on video in a lovers' spat...

1339
01:31:15,264 --> 01:31:18,184
...with a woman now identified
as a hotel maid.

1340
01:31:18,351 --> 01:31:19,894
Who's kidding who here?

1341
01:31:20,061 --> 01:31:23,064
Think you would've looked
at me if you knew I was the maid?

1342
01:31:23,231 --> 01:31:25,441
-With respect--
-Oh, shit.

1343
01:31:26,651 --> 01:31:27,819
Oh, my God.

1344
01:31:28,486 --> 01:31:30,571
We won't--
We will not be answering--

1345
01:31:30,738 --> 01:31:33,574
We will not be taking
any questions right now.

1346
01:31:33,741 --> 01:31:36,703
Mr. Marshall will make a statement.

1347
01:31:41,708 --> 01:31:43,459
Morning.

1348
01:31:43,626 --> 01:31:45,753
I’d like to make a short statement.

1349
01:31:45,920 --> 01:31:49,632
And it will be all
that I have to say about this....

1350
01:31:49,841 --> 01:31:53,136
This invasion of my privacy.

1351
01:31:55,346 --> 01:31:58,391
I happened to meet
Miss Ventura and her son...

1352
01:31:58,558 --> 01:32:04,522
...during my stay
at a hotel in New York.

1353
01:32:05,523 --> 01:32:07,817
And we became friends.

1354
01:32:10,028 --> 01:32:14,407
There are people from all walks
of life who I count as friends.

1355
01:32:14,574 --> 01:32:18,494
And my only regret in this instance
is that one of them, Miss Ventura...

1356
01:32:21,247 --> 01:32:24,500
...was subjected to the scrutiny
and innuendo of the media...

1357
01:32:24,709 --> 01:32:28,379
...as a result of that friendship with me.

1358
01:32:37,805 --> 01:32:41,893
I need these numbers
to be plus 10 percent.

1359
01:33:03,414 --> 01:33:05,875
Welcome to the employee cafeteria.

1360
01:33:08,836 --> 01:33:11,673
It’s open 24 hours a day....

1361
01:33:12,256 --> 01:33:14,008
Please.

1362
01:33:31,818 --> 01:33:33,903
Is today the 19th?

1363
01:33:34,112 --> 01:33:36,239
Six more shopping days.

1364
01:33:36,406 --> 01:33:38,032
He's here. He's back!

1365
01:33:38,199 --> 01:33:42,328
-Who? What are you reading?
-Yesterday's paper. Chris is in town.

1366
01:33:42,495 --> 01:33:44,914
So? Go put your clothes on.
It’s late.

1367
01:33:45,081 --> 01:33:47,458
So? He's giving a press conference.
Guess where?

1368
01:33:47,625 --> 01:33:51,254
I don't care. Okay? Come on.
Put your turtleneck on too. It’s cold.

1369
01:33:51,462 --> 01:33:52,964
At your hotel.

1370
01:33:53,131 --> 01:33:54,299
-Ma!
-What?

1371
01:33:54,465 --> 01:33:55,591
At your hotel!

1372
01:33:55,758 --> 01:33:57,927
I heard you, bubba!

1373
01:33:58,136 --> 01:34:02,056
Don't you think it's weird?
You'll be there, he'll be there.

1374
01:34:02,849 --> 01:34:05,727
So will a thousand other people.
We talked about this.

1375
01:34:05,893 --> 01:34:08,354
You have your
turtleneck on backwards.

1376
01:34:08,521 --> 01:34:10,273
I thought we talked about this.

1377
01:34:10,773 --> 01:34:12,442
I know, but it's like fate.

1378
01:34:12,608 --> 01:34:17,238
No, it's like New York City
and an available conference room.

1379
01:34:17,405 --> 01:34:19,115
You knew, didn't you?

1380
01:34:19,324 --> 01:34:22,327
You weren't gonna tell me.
You knew he was coming.

1381
01:34:22,493 --> 01:34:26,581
Remember, bubba, what I told you?
We talked about this.

1382
01:34:26,998 --> 01:34:31,044
He's not part of our lives,
but we wish him luck with his, right?

1383
01:34:32,003 --> 01:34:33,296
You think he misses us?

1384
01:34:38,217 --> 01:34:41,220
Well, he'd be crazy not to.

1385
01:35:04,661 --> 01:35:07,538
Mr. Marshall, if elected,
you'll be the third Marshall...

1386
01:35:07,705 --> 01:35:10,833
...to serve New York in the Senate.
How does it feel?

1387
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,336
lf I get elected, I’ll let you know.

1388
01:35:15,213 --> 01:35:17,090
Did your father
leave you any advice?

1389
01:35:17,256 --> 01:35:20,635
Yeah, he said, “Don't run.”

1390
01:35:21,886 --> 01:35:24,013
We have time
for one more question, folks.

1391
01:35:24,222 --> 01:35:26,641
Then we have
a meet-and-greet in the Green Room.

1392
01:35:26,808 --> 01:35:28,768
I have a question.

1393
01:35:29,978 --> 01:35:34,649
-What? Who said that?
-Mr. Marshall, down here.

1394
01:35:36,025 --> 01:35:37,485
Sure.

1395
01:35:37,694 --> 01:35:40,029
What's your question?

1396
01:35:41,572 --> 01:35:42,657
I was wondering....

1397
01:35:42,824 --> 01:35:46,119
-Chris, don't do this.
-No. Wait. I’m listening. Go ahead.

1398
01:35:46,285 --> 01:35:47,370
Well....

1399
01:35:48,413 --> 01:35:51,165
I know everyone makes mistakes.

1400
01:35:51,332 --> 01:35:55,837
And it's a sign of character to give
a person a second chance, right?

1401
01:35:56,004 --> 01:35:58,715
Right. I’m with you.

1402
01:36:00,091 --> 01:36:04,137
Even if someone lied,
they should be forgiven.

1403
01:36:04,304 --> 01:36:07,557
Otherwise, we'd never have
any congressmen or presidents.

1404
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:11,853
Thanks very much.
We have to wrap this up.

1405
01:36:12,020 --> 01:36:14,522
Jerry, he's not done. Go on.

1406
01:36:14,731 --> 01:36:20,320
Well, what if you're not a politician
trying to do good for everybody?

1407
01:36:20,486 --> 01:36:23,865
What if you're just a regular person,
like a maid or something?

1408
01:36:26,034 --> 01:36:28,661
And she made a mistake.

1409
01:36:29,287 --> 01:36:31,706
Do you think she should
get a second chance?

1410
01:36:31,873 --> 01:36:33,708
I mean, nobody's perfect, right?

1411
01:36:34,667 --> 01:36:38,254
No. Nobody's perfect.

1412
01:36:39,005 --> 01:36:42,508
Ladies and gentlemen of the press,
take a look at a future candidate.

1413
01:36:43,468 --> 01:36:47,096
All right, thanks very much, folks.
We'll see you all in Buffalo.

1414
01:36:47,305 --> 01:36:52,518
-Don't do this. Don't throw it all--
-I’m just trusting my instincts here.

1415
01:36:57,065 --> 01:36:58,733
-Great speech.
-Really?

1416
01:36:59,067 --> 01:37:01,569
-Eating out of your hands.
-Thanks.

1417
01:37:07,158 --> 01:37:08,117
Cool.

1418
01:37:09,118 --> 01:37:11,120
Where is she?

1419
01:37:13,498 --> 01:37:15,124
This way!

1420
01:37:24,425 --> 01:37:27,762
-Have you seen Marisa Ventura?
-No, I haven't seen Marisa.

1421
01:37:44,237 --> 01:37:46,364
We haven't had this
kind of story in a while.

1422
01:37:46,531 --> 01:37:47,657
It will kill his career.

1423
01:37:48,032 --> 01:37:50,535
Will this hurt your
announcement for senator?

1424
01:37:50,702 --> 01:37:56,124
Mr. Marshall, are you still seeing her?
Was it love at first sight, Mr. Marshall?

1425
01:37:59,002 --> 01:37:59,502
-Marisa?
-Hey, Ma.

1426
01:37:59,502 --> 01:38:00,670
-Marisa?
-Hey, Ma.

1427
01:38:00,878 --> 01:38:05,883
Ty? What are you both
doing down here? What's--?

1428
01:38:18,062 --> 01:38:19,814
Hello.

1429
01:38:20,898 --> 01:38:23,401
-Hi.
-Hi.

1430
01:38:23,568 --> 01:38:25,361
Look....

1431
01:38:26,612 --> 01:38:29,282
Can we start over?

1432
01:38:29,449 --> 01:38:31,909
Second chance, second date?

1433
01:38:32,076 --> 01:38:34,412
You as you, me as me.

1434
01:38:34,579 --> 01:38:36,789
No secrets.

1435
01:38:37,623 --> 01:38:39,375
What do you think?

1436
01:38:39,917 --> 01:38:44,130
-We know you're in there!
-Open up! Only one way out.

1437
01:38:54,599 --> 01:38:56,684
Marisa Ventura.

1438
01:38:58,269 --> 01:39:00,438
Housekeeping.

1439
01:39:01,272 --> 01:39:05,068
Chris Marshall. Candidate for Senate.

1440
01:39:05,526 --> 01:39:07,195
I’d appreciate your vote.

1441
01:39:09,238 --> 01:39:10,531
We'll see.

1442
01:39:13,493 --> 01:39:14,952
We're in!

1443
01:39:15,119 --> 01:39:17,288
Mr. Marshall, over here!

1444
01:39:17,455 --> 01:39:19,457
Mr. Marshall.

1445
01:39:30,134 --> 01:39:31,427
Mira.

1446
01:39:31,594 --> 01:39:33,179
Esa es mi hija.

1447
01:39:34,222 --> 01:39:35,598
What's your relationship...

1448
01:39:35,765 --> 01:39:39,519
-...with the Latin community?
-Excellent. He speaks Latin-- Spanish.

1449
01:39:43,690 --> 01:39:45,692
Miss Ventura, will you
clean up the Senate?

1450
01:39:45,858 --> 01:39:50,154
What do you think, sir?
You two got a chance? Sir?
