As the bitter chill of winter...

168
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,040
descends on Moscow...

169
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:11,360
Russians are warming
to the angry rhetoric...

170
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,839
of former communist boss
Ivan Tretiak.

171
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,400
Now a billionaire oil magnate...

172
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,360
and leader
of his own political party...

173
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,240
Tretiak predicted that the civil
unrest engulfing Russia...

174
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:25,400
will only worsen, unless
Reformist President Karpov...

175
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,160
can overcome
the heating-oil shortage...

176
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:30,120
that has already killed
scores of Russians.

177
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,360
WOMAN: What beautiful work.

178
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,560
Ah. Cloisonne.

179
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,680
It is old.

180
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,800
SIMON: [Spanish accent] Yes.
It belonged to my grandmother.

181
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,760
Please.

182
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,280
Tonight I feel like
the oldest person on this plane.

183
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:15,120
My husband, he's sending me
to England to live...

184
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,080
until things change.

185
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:20,760
You are married
not even a year...

186
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,120
and already this bastard
has a girlfriend?!

187
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,400
I am sorry.

188
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,840
It's not my business.

189
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:32,480
How come you know
so much about me?

190
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,720
It is a gift.

191
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:40,640
I'm Martin de Porres.
I am from Spain...

192
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,520
but I'm named
for a Peruvian saint...

193
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:45,560
who could cure
the sick or the injured...

194
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,120
by the laying of hands.

195
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:01,080
INSPECTOR: Hmm.
He's the same build...

196
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,400
as the description
the Russians gave us...

197
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,000
but he doesn't
sound like an Aussie.

198
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,160
WOMAN: No.

199
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,360
WOMAN: Could be faking it.

200
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,800
SECURITY GUARD:
X-rays are clear.

201
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,320
He hasn't swallowed
the microchip. Anything?

202
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:25,040
SIMON: You English with
your chips, your fish and chips.

203
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,440
On the airplane, I had chicken.

204
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,560
WOMAN: Van Gogh theft,
Netherlands.

205
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,600
Last year. Same eyes.

206
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,320
INSPECTOR: Different chin.

207
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,600
DRIVER: Halcyon Hotel, guv.

PRIEST: Stand up!

209
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,040
What is your name?!

210
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,520
Answer the question!

211
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,000
[Echoing]
What is your name?! Hey!

212
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,600
MAN ON TELEPHONE:
Lou, the microchip arrived.

213
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,760
I put the dough in your account.

214
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,000
SIMON: Sorry I didn't get back
to you about that diamond.

215
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,600
Moscow's like Dodge City now.

216
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,160
All them greedy Commies have
turned into crazy capitalists.

217
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,440
It's disgusting.
It's made 'em sloppy.

218
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,680
One or two more easy scores
like this last one...

219
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,880
-I top 50 mil, I'm quitting.
-I heard that before.

220
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,280
SIMON: Not from me.
I don't know nuttin'.

221
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,720
You don't believe me?
Try and find me.

222
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,120
-Fuck you, Lou.
-See yourself.

223
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,760
Can't seem to break 50.

TRETIAK: Who are you?

SIMON: My name
is Bruno Hautenfaust.

240
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,560
I was named for a saint
who was a very wealthy man.

Had the wine, women, songs...

then took a vow of poverty
and became a hermit...

in the nude.

I'm his business manager.

Come on, Father. Let's go.

Listen and learn.

CIA? MI-6? Libya?

SIMON: He's not a racecar.
Nobody runs him.

255
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,000
He's an independent contractor.

256

TRETIAK: Good. Then no one
will mind if I kill him.

Oh, yes.

258
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,880
I can have a man killed

Be quiet.

SIMON: What is it
you request of my employer?

266
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,440
TRETIAK: Do you know
what cold fusion is?

267
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,880
SIMON: Of course.

268
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:14,040
It's the theory...

269
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,600
of nuclear fusion
at room temperature...

270
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,720
free energy forever.

271
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,000
TRETIAK: Yes.

00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,120
SERVER: Kaffee?

SIMON: Klein, Bitte.

274
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:26,720
SIMON: As far as science goes,
it ranks just above astrology.

275
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,640
Those who claim to
have achieved the experiment...

276
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,760
have never been able
to duplicate it.

277
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,040
TRETIAK: Until now.

278
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:37,720
There is an electrochemist
working at Oxford.

279
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,040
We believe
that this good lady...

280
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,880
made a breakthrough
in cold fusion.

281
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:46,840
Your employer
will obtain the formula for me.

282
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,520
He's very busy,
and you are very boring.

283
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,320
Your offer must inspire him.

284
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,840
This woman
has repeatedly avoided...

285
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,560
my agents' attempts
to find the formula.

286
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,600
She's cagey, difficult.

287
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,160
Maybe your agents are stupid.

288
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:12,000
I think this inspiration would
cost you three million dollars.

289
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:14,240
TRETIAK: [Chuckles]
Ridiculous.

290
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,840
SIMON: Why? You will have
the world market in energy.

291
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,240
Cost you a nickel
for every million you make.

292
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,520
His deposit should go--

293
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:25,600
Hey. It is not for me.

294
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,080
It is for mother Russia.

295
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,880
But you want mother Russia,
too, Mr. Tretiak.

296
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:34,520
Three million on deposit 
in a bank account in Zurich. Agreed?

297
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,240
Yes.

298
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:43,360
And... How long to get
your employer's agreement?

299
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,560
I'll ask.

300
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,920
Your offer has inspired her.

301
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,040
I'll do it.

302
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,840
Bank account number in Zurich.

303
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,600
Auf wiedersehen. Bye, sonny.

304
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,360
TRETIAK: Bye-bye.

305
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:15,920
I really love this guy.
Ha ha ha!

306
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,960
ILYA:
Too bad we have to kill him.

307
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,360
Yeah, too bad.

308
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,600
WOMAN: When the electrochemists
Pons and Fleischman...

309
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:42,040
announced in 1989...

310
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:45,160
that they had discovered
cold fusion...

311
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:49,320
a revolutionary process
of generating energy...

312
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,720
they were at first
acclaimed as geniuses...

313
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:55,480
and then condemned
as charlatans.

314
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,520
The protocols of cold fusion...

315
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,920
SIMON: What are those? Drugs?

316
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,960
Could I have one?
My head's pounding.

317
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,040
She's boring the life
out of me.

318
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,800
-They're for my heart.
-Oh.

319
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:14,080
You have very pretty eyes.
You're a pretty lady.

320
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:16,480
-Who are you?
-Me?

321
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,920
I'm here to do an interview
with that Dr. Russell.

322
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,560
I'm gonna expose her as a fraud.

323
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,440
You don't put any stock in
this cold fusion mumbo jumbo?

324
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,520
-Actually, I do.
-Really?

325
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:29,640
WOMAN: Dr. Emma Russell.

00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,680
Oops.

327
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:47,440
EMMA: Well, I didn't prepare
any formal remarks.

328
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,360
I'm actually more interested...

329
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:52,760
in what questions you all have
about cold fusion...

330
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,840
so I thought we would
start with those.

331
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,880
Any questions?

332
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,160
Please?

333
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,640
MAN: I have, Dr. Russell.

334
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,720
Can you explain
the actual process of fusion...

335
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,320
you know, the theory?

336
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,080
Yes. Oh, there it is.

337
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:13,960
This is the--the apparatus.

338
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,320
And very simply...

339
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,480
when positively charged
deuterons...

340
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:21,360
are attracted
to the palladium cathode...

341
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,800
they cram together...

342
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:26,240
and there are millions of them
inside the cathode...

343
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:29,520
getting closer and closer,
and then they fuse...

344
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,640
and they create energy
in the form of helium.

345
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,200
WOMAN: But I read somewhere...

346
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,920
that the experiment
couldn't be replicated...

347
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,600
so how do we know it works?

348
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,720
EMMA: We don't.

349
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:41,880
Not yet.

350
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,760
But if you remember Einstein...

351
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,800
he knew the theory
of relativity to be true...

352
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,600
long before he could prove it.

353
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,360
I mean, he felt the truth.

354
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,800
And, uh, some of us
feel the same way...

355
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,000
about cold fusion...

356
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:58,400
because it's there.
It's in nature...

357
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:03,000
the raw, natural power
just waiting to be harnessed.

358
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:07,280
When we ignite
that cold fusion fire...

359
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,520
I mean, just imagine.

360
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:14,480
There's more energy
in one cubic mile of seawater...

361
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:17,240
than in all the known
oil reserves on earth.

362
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:21,200
I mean, you could drive
your car 55 million miles...

363
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,600
on a gallon of heavy water.

364
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:26,400
It would be the end
of pollution...

365
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,880
warmth for the whole world.

366
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:34,080
So why don't I demonstrate
for you...

367
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:37,720
why other people in the past
have been so unsuccessful?

01:21:19,280 --> 01:21:21,640
He treats you like dirt.
You could have it all.

983
01:21:21,680 --> 01:21:23,160
ILYA: What are you saying?

984
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:25,320
I'm saying your father
stashed billions...

985
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:28,240
and I know where it's hidden.
Let's make a deal.

986
01:21:28,280 --> 01:21:31,800
So...where are all those
hidden billions?

987
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:36,280
I know...but I don't think
I'm gonna tell you.

988
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:01,440
[Sirens]

989
01:22:04,880 --> 01:22:07,640
MAN: Joseph, what's the holdup?
I said get 'em inside!

990
01:22:07,680 --> 01:22:09,560
DOCTOR: You're worse
than all the others.

991
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:12,200
However, burns will heal.

992
01:22:12,240 --> 01:22:14,800
Maybe a little chance
of scarring, perhaps...

993
01:22:14,840 --> 01:22:18,080
but all in all,
I'd say he's a very lucky boy.

994
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:20,360
ILYA: Lucky? Look at me.

995
01:22:21,240 --> 01:22:23,800
I am a damn devil.

996
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:25,320
TRETIAK: Christ.

997
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:29,560
Yes?

998
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:32,600
BOTVIN: I have run every test
on this cold fusion formula...

999
01:22:32,640 --> 01:22:37,000
and must conclude
it is not merely incomplete...

1000
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:39,240
but rather... 
impossible.

1001
01:22:39,280 --> 01:22:42,920
You may as well try to create
perpetual motion, Mr. Tretiak.

1002
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:46,560
I invest millions...

1003
01:22:47,720 --> 01:22:50,560
and you can't make it work!

1004
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:56,640
What are you doing
with my money?

1005
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:02,880
Do you think it comes so easy?

1006
01:23:02,920 --> 01:23:04,040
No!

1007
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:06,040
BOTVIN: But, sir...

1008
01:23:06,080 --> 01:23:10,560
I have been working for
nearly two weeks without sleep.

1009
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:15,000
At first blush, the theorem
appears quite impressiv, convincing.

1010
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:16,520
It does?

1011
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:24,920
Yes. It does.

1012
01:23:25,640 --> 01:23:26,920
Good man.

1013
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:29,520
We can use it
to destroy our enemies.

1014
01:23:31,240 --> 01:23:34,600
TRETIAK: Only Dr. Russell
can spoil my plan.

1015
01:23:34,640 --> 01:23:37,320
If she gets back to London
and speaks to the press...

1016
01:23:37,360 --> 01:23:41,040
YURI: From here to the airport
are three army checkpoints...

1017
01:23:41,080 --> 01:23:42,880
all of them loyal to us.

1018
01:23:42,920 --> 01:23:44,920
TRETIAK: Make certain
they get the message--

1019
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:47,720
she doesn't leave Moscow alive.

1020
01:23:50,160 --> 01:23:51,360
Mr. President.

1021
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:54,400
As former Vice-minister
of Energy and Power...

1022
01:23:54,440 --> 01:23:59,520
I hear all manner of schemes
that provide cheaper energy.

1023
01:23:59,560 --> 01:24:03,000
And as our countrymen
freeze to death...

1024
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:06,360
I've become aware of
a marvelous new technology...

1025
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:09,240
about which I'm hopelessly
out of my league...

1026
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:11,920
from a scientific viewpoint.

1027
01:24:11,960 --> 01:24:15,080
That's why I brought
our eminent physicist here...

1028
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:18,240
Dr. Lev Botvin from
the University of Moscow.

1029
01:24:18,280 --> 01:24:20,760
AIDE: Before we are dazzled
by the good news...

1030
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:23,360
let's dispense with the bad.

1031
01:24:23,400 --> 01:24:25,520
What is the price
of this marvel?

1032
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:28,280
YURI: The cost of research
and development are there...

1033
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:31,880
which is all
you are asked to defray.

1034
01:24:36,760 --> 01:24:39,400
Ten billion in hard currency?

1035
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:44,360
I can't even pay my teachers,
my miners, my doctors.

1036
01:24:51,560 --> 01:24:53,480
Where are you heading?

1037
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:56,800
I thought we'd drink
some vodka to get warmer.

1038
01:25:00,840 --> 01:25:03,800
Like the miracle of socialism...

1039
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:07,040
our miracle
of cold fusion failed.

1040
01:25:07,080 --> 01:25:08,200
But no matter.

1041
01:25:08,240 --> 01:25:12,360
We have sold cold fusion
to President Karpov.

1042
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:15,800
We will use the scandal
of its failure to destroy him.

1043
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:18,600
The army must be mobilized
by midnight tomorrow.

1044
01:25:18,640 --> 01:25:22,120
You're a man in a hurry.
That's only one day.

We're working.

TRETIAK: Yes. Think of it.

1047
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:32,520
One day, you can be proud again
to be a Russian general...

1048
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:36,520
with a big nuclear missile
where your prick used to be.

AIDE: You must complete a form
before you get on a flight home.

1050
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:41,160
Any medical problems?

EMMA: I have a heart condition.

1052

any medication for you?

1053
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,440
EMMA: Well, I haven't
needed a pill.

1054
01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:50,120
That's strange.

1055

table three down the corridor.

1056

all the way to the airport.

in central Moscow...

1060
01:25:59,240 --> 01:26:03,680
where a mob attacked several
companies with ties to America.

1061
01:26:03,720 --> 01:26:07,520
Apparently, four U.S. citizens
were injured in the attack.

01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:09,360
I'm told
that all American citizens...

Are you coming with me?

1074
01:26:41,120 --> 01:26:44,480
No. But they are.

1075
01:26:50,400 --> 01:26:53,880
I'll need you to develop
a sudden fear of flying.

1076
01:26:53,920 --> 01:26:55,720
Find a quiet room.

Finish the formula
and fax it back to me.

My number's on the back.

1079

I don't understand.
Why are you keeping my cards?

1080
01:27:04,240 --> 01:27:06,000
I've got to deal
with the Russians...

1081
01:27:06,040 --> 01:27:08,040
or you'll never be safe.

-Trust who?

What's your name?

1087
01:27:21,360 --> 01:27:24,040
My name is August Christopher.

1088

Of course I trust you,

Thomas More.

1092
01:27:35,160 --> 01:27:38,000
After all,
you are my personal saint.

1093
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:40,760
You have to be a very good...

1094
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:44,200
and, usually, a very dead person
to become a saint.

1095
01:27:44,240 --> 01:27:47,720
And more importantly,
you have to work three miracles.

1096
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:49,960
Now, get to work.

1097

Better hurry. It's leaving.

will depose the president...

It's so simple.

1294
01:41:37,560 --> 01:41:39,680
I love you, Simon.

1295
01:41:40,880 --> 01:41:42,840
Miracle three.

1296
01:42:05,400 --> 01:42:07,320
EMMA: Dear Simon...

1297
01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:10,600
the pin is something I've kept for years. 
God knows why.

1298
01:42:10,640 --> 01:42:13,920
A graduation gift
from Catholic school.

1299
01:42:13,960 --> 01:42:16,400
But don't worry.
You don't have to wear it.

1300
01:42:16,440 --> 01:42:18,800
I just wanted you
to have something of mine...

1301
01:42:18,840 --> 01:42:20,880
something I loved.

1302
01:42:20,920 --> 01:42:23,680
Simon, if sainthood
requires three miracles...

1303
01:42:23,720 --> 01:42:26,360
then I'd say you've made it,
my love...

1304
01:42:26,400 --> 01:42:28,480
and so I hope you'll understand.

1305
01:42:28,520 --> 01:42:31,960
Last night, it became clear
what I have to do this morning.

1306
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:35,200
I'm going to give
cold fusion to the world.

1307
01:42:35,240 --> 01:42:38,000
It's the only way,
if we're ever together again...

1308
01:42:38,040 --> 01:42:41,720
that I'll know it's for you,
and you'll know it's for me.

1309
01:42:41,720 --> 01:42:46,680
If cold fusion is free,
then you and I, Simon,  will be free, too.

1310
01:42:46,720 --> 01:42:49,840
Listen. If you think giving away
everything before the world...

1311
01:42:49,880 --> 01:42:52,120
preventing us from making
an unimaginable fortune...

1312
01:42:52,160 --> 01:42:54,200
will accomplish anything...

1313
01:42:55,360 --> 01:42:57,000
you're absolutely right.

1314
01:42:58,520 --> 01:43:00,400
Simon, what are you doing here?

1315
01:43:00,440 --> 01:43:02,800
There are police.

1316
01:43:02,840 --> 01:43:04,240
They're everywhere.

1317
01:43:04,280 --> 01:43:06,520
I wouldn't miss it
for the world.

1318
01:43:06,560 --> 01:43:09,480
-You wore the pin.
-Of course.

1319
01:43:13,280 --> 01:43:14,400
You better go.

1320
01:43:27,760 --> 01:43:29,040
How will I find you?

1321
01:43:29,080 --> 01:43:30,960
[Giggles]

1322
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:33,720
I'll find you. You found me.

1323
01:43:51,800 --> 01:43:54,280
[Applause]

1324
01:43:59,760 --> 01:44:02,720
Although our next speaker
requires no introduction...

1325
01:44:02,760 --> 01:44:07,120
after last week's
Moscow fireworks...

1326
01:44:07,160 --> 01:44:11,400
please let me welcome
Dr. E.J. Russell.

1327
01:44:11,440 --> 01:44:15,160
SIMON: Excuse me.
Is this seat taken?

1328
01:44:15,200 --> 01:44:18,080
No.

1329
01:44:18,120 --> 01:44:19,840
CHAIRMAN: Dr. Russell?

1330
01:44:28,520 --> 01:44:31,320
You don't believe in all this
cold fusion mumbo jumbo, do you?

1331
01:44:31,320 --> 01:44:32,920
EMMA:
Thank you. Good morning.

1332
01:44:32,960 --> 01:44:34,400
INSPECTOR: No.

1333
01:44:34,440 --> 01:44:38,480
We all know cold fusion
has had a...

1334
01:44:38,520 --> 01:44:41,360
a difficult childhood.

1335
01:44:41,400 --> 01:44:43,920
Those of us in the field
are orphans...

1336
01:44:43,960 --> 01:44:45,840
bastards, at best.

1337
01:44:45,880 --> 01:44:50,800
But difficult childhoods, I believe, 
make the most interesting adults.

1338
01:44:52,240 --> 01:44:55,680
I know most of you thought
that cold fusion...

1339
01:44:55,720 --> 01:44:57,080
SIMON: I'm her biggest fan.

1340
01:44:57,120 --> 01:44:59,840
I think she's a fox.
Look at that.

1341
01:44:59,840 --> 01:45:00,960
EMMA: Even though
some of you may feel...

1342
01:45:00,960 --> 01:45:02,760
EMMA: Even though
some of you may feel...

1343
01:45:02,800 --> 01:45:06,400
that its practical application
is still somewhat speculative...

1344
01:45:06,440 --> 01:45:10,520
I've come here today to share
how that dream is slowly...

1345
01:45:10,560 --> 01:45:12,240
becoming a reality.

1346
01:45:12,280 --> 01:45:15,040
Yes, it may take years
to finally learn...

1347
01:45:15,080 --> 01:45:16,960
SIMON: Look at the time.
Got to go.

1348
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:20,480
EMMA: ...stabilize its power,
but with your help...

1349
01:45:20,520 --> 01:45:23,400
we can all work towards
making the--the...

1350
01:45:24,520 --> 01:45:28,800
dream of cold fusion
finally come true.

1351
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:53,080
Quickly!

1352
01:45:53,120 --> 01:45:54,880
We got him!

1353
01:45:54,880 --> 01:45:56,760
Hyah!

1354
01:45:58,400 --> 01:46:00,120
INSPECTOR:
Hands behind your back!

1355
01:46:00,160 --> 01:46:02,160
Got you, you slippery--

Damn!

1358
01:46:17,280 --> 01:46:19,120
REPORTER: Donations totaling
three billion dollars...

1359
01:46:19,160 --> 01:46:21,040
were made today
to the Red Cross....

1360
01:46:21,080 --> 01:46:22,360
the Salvation Army...

1361
01:46:22,400 --> 01:46:24,080
and the United Nations
Children's Fund.

1362
01:46:24,120 --> 01:46:25,760
The funds were wired
from the account...

1363
01:46:25,800 --> 01:46:28,760
of jailed Russian tycoon
Ivan Tretiak.

1364
01:46:28,800 --> 01:46:30,680
In other philanthropic news...

1365
01:46:30,720 --> 01:46:32,960
a nonprofit
research foundation...

1366
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:36,960
has been established to develop
cold fusion technology...

1367
01:46:36,960 --> 01:46:39,160
funded with
an anonymous donation...

1368
01:46:39,200 --> 01:46:43,080
and to be headed by Russian
physicist Dr. Lev Botvin.

1369
01:46:43,120 --> 01:46:45,440

and the ones
who've gone before.

1375
01:46:57,960 --> 01:47:00,040
Here it comes now...

01:47:00,080 --> 01:47:03,200
sure as silence follows rain...

1377
01:47:03,240 --> 01:47:06,080
the taste of you upon my lips...

the fingers in my brain.

Ever gentle...

01:47:10,720 --> 01:47:14,400
as it kills me where I lay...

01:47:14,440 --> 01:47:16,920
who am I to resist?

1382

Who are you to fail?

1383
01:47:19,360 --> 01:47:23,280
Got to get you out of my mind...

1384
01:47:24,480 --> 01:47:28,880
but I can't escape
from the feeling...

1385
01:47:28,920 --> 01:47:33,680
as I try to leave
the memory behind.

1386

Without you,
what's left to believe in?

1387
01:47:51,320 --> 01:47:53,720
I'm so sorry...

1388
01:47:53,760 --> 01:47:56,640
for the way it had to go.

1389
01:47:56,640 --> 01:47:59,040
Now I feel your presence...

1390
01:47:59,080 --> 01:48:01,800
in a way I could not know...

1391
01:48:01,840 --> 01:48:03,880
and I wonder...

1392
01:48:03,920 --> 01:48:07,360
do you ever feel the same?

1393
01:48:07,400 --> 01:48:09,560
In the spilling darkness...

1394
01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:12,840
do you ever hear my name?

Got to get you out of my mind...

1396
01:48:17,920 --> 01:48:22,200
but I can't escape
from the feeling...

out of my mind...
