1025
01:52:27,421 --> 01:52:29,480
l'll find something.

1026
01:53:45,499 --> 01:53:47,433
Oh, Tomas.

1027
01:53:47,501 --> 01:53:49,731
Tomas.

1028
01:53:51,505 --> 01:53:53,439
Tomas.

1029
01:53:53,507 --> 01:53:56,067
Tomas.

1030
01:53:57,477 --> 01:53:59,570
Oh...

1031
01:53:59,646 --> 01:54:01,910
Oh!

1032
01:54:01,982 --> 01:54:04,917
Oh...

1033
01:54:04,985 --> 01:54:08,079
Oh...

1034
01:54:16,029 --> 01:54:18,930
l really
don't like to do this.

1035
01:54:18,999 --> 01:54:20,694
l shouldn't
have to do this.

1036
01:54:20,767 --> 01:54:25,170
You remember the article you wrote
about King Oedipus?

1037
01:54:25,238 --> 01:54:28,730
How communist leaders
should have put out their eyes?

1038
01:54:28,808 --> 01:54:32,005
Yes, l'd almost forgotten.

1039
01:54:33,747 --> 01:54:36,147
Well, they haven't.

1040
01:54:39,252 --> 01:54:41,686
They've prepared
this little letter...

1041
01:54:41,755 --> 01:54:43,689
sort of retraction.

1042
01:54:43,757 --> 01:54:45,725
Say you got it wrong,

1043
01:54:45,792 --> 01:54:48,090
you really
didn't understand...

1044
01:54:48,161 --> 01:54:50,356
You sign. That's all.

1045
01:54:51,798 --> 01:54:54,062
Don't misunderstand.

1046
01:54:54,134 --> 01:54:57,228
They're not asking for
a public declaration.

1047
01:54:57,304 --> 01:54:59,704
They're just
prudent bureaucrats.

1048
01:54:59,773 --> 01:55:01,832
They've given me
their word.

1049
01:55:01,908 --> 01:55:05,139
They won't
publish anything.

1050
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:10,543
l need you, Tomas.

1051
01:55:11,885 --> 01:55:14,581
l hope l can keep you.

1052
01:55:14,654 --> 01:55:18,317
You're not a writer,
savior of the country.

1053
01:55:18,391 --> 01:55:20,951
You're a doctor.
A scientist.

1054
01:55:23,363 --> 01:55:27,299
This article's so terribly
important to you?

1055
01:55:29,302 --> 01:55:31,065
lt couldn't be
less important.

1056
01:55:56,378 --> 01:55:57,777
Hi, Tomas.

1057
01:55:57,847 --> 01:55:58,939
Hi.

1058
01:56:06,388 --> 01:56:08,322
Tomas.

1059
01:56:08,390 --> 01:56:09,789
Hello, Jiri!

1060
01:56:09,859 --> 01:56:12,327
lt's nice to
see you back.

1061
01:56:12,394 --> 01:56:13,793
How are you?

1062
01:56:13,863 --> 01:56:15,956
Thanks, fine.

1063
01:56:16,031 --> 01:56:21,469
So...are you going to sign
the...thing?

1064
01:56:21,537 --> 01:56:23,232
What thing?

1065
01:56:23,305 --> 01:56:26,297
Mmm...your, um...

1066
01:56:26,375 --> 01:56:28,468
retraction.

1067
01:56:30,412 --> 01:56:33,711
What do you know
about my retraction?

1068
01:56:35,384 --> 01:56:37,318
Have you read it?

1069
01:56:37,386 --> 01:56:38,853
No.

1070
01:56:38,921 --> 01:56:41,981
But you know
how things work.

1071
01:56:44,894 --> 01:56:48,990
Who told you l had agreed
to go along with it?

1072
01:56:55,437 --> 01:56:56,927
See you.

1073
01:56:57,006 --> 01:56:58,997
Ha ha ha ha...

1074
01:57:19,428 --> 01:57:21,862
l suppose
a lot of them

1075
01:57:21,931 --> 01:57:23,899
have signed
these letters.

1076
01:57:23,966 --> 01:57:25,900
They're kept
on file.

1077
01:57:25,968 --> 01:57:29,369
They know they can be published
at any moment,

1078
01:57:29,438 --> 01:57:31,872
so they
keep quiet, see?

1079
01:57:31,941 --> 01:57:34,375
They can't say
anything anymore.

1080
01:57:34,443 --> 01:57:37,207
They accept
everything.

1081
01:57:40,449 --> 01:57:44,545
Cowardice slowly becomes
a rule of life.

1082
01:57:46,455 --> 01:57:48,889
Yes, l have
the feeling

1083
01:57:48,958 --> 01:57:52,894
that everyone would be
very happy to see me sign.

1084
01:57:52,962 --> 01:57:55,055
Everyone...
everyone but me.

1085
01:58:41,510 --> 01:58:44,604
So...what can
l do for you?

1086
01:58:46,015 --> 01:58:50,884
There is nothing you can do
for me, Doctor.

1087
01:58:50,953 --> 01:58:54,753
l represent
the Ministry of the lnterior.

1088
01:58:58,694 --> 01:59:02,528
Everybody at the Ministry
regrets seeing you here.

1089
01:59:02,598 --> 01:59:06,591
You are one of our best
brain specialists.

1090
01:59:06,668 --> 01:59:08,101
Just between us--

1091
01:59:08,170 --> 01:59:10,604
maybe l shouldn't
say it--

1092
01:59:10,672 --> 01:59:14,608
we don't all agree
with the drastic tactics

1093
01:59:14,676 --> 01:59:20,114
that are removing our top specialists
from their posts.

1094
01:59:21,417 --> 01:59:24,784
One can only be sorry
about all this.

1095
01:59:27,222 --> 01:59:28,621
May l?

1096
01:59:28,690 --> 01:59:30,282
Please.

1097
01:59:33,195 --> 01:59:36,130
You had a very good
position in Geneva,

1098
01:59:36,198 --> 01:59:38,632
and you came back
to our country.

1099
01:59:38,700 --> 01:59:41,669
We very much appreciate
your having returned,

1100
01:59:41,737 --> 01:59:44,672
but your place is at
the operating table.

1101
01:59:44,740 --> 01:59:46,799
l couldn't agree more.

1102
01:59:46,875 --> 01:59:48,638
Everybody agrees.

1103
01:59:48,710 --> 01:59:51,975
Then...
tell me, Doctor...

1104
01:59:52,047 --> 01:59:54,140
do you really think

1105
01:59:54,216 --> 01:59:58,516
that communists should pluck out
their own eyes?

1106
02:00:00,222 --> 02:00:03,157
You, who have healed
so many people?

1107
02:00:03,225 --> 02:00:05,193
That wasn't what l meant.

1108
02:00:05,260 --> 02:00:07,660
But that's how everyone
understood it.

1109
02:00:07,729 --> 02:00:10,664
And we can
only regret it.

1110
02:00:10,732 --> 02:00:13,667
How can you
let people think

1111
02:00:13,735 --> 02:00:15,703
that you,
a doctor,

1112
02:00:15,771 --> 02:00:20,504
want to deprive human beings
of their right to see?

1113
02:00:23,345 --> 02:00:25,279
Maybe someone
inspired this article?

1114
02:00:25,347 --> 02:00:26,939
No, no one.

1115
02:00:27,015 --> 02:00:28,949
Did you know
the publishers?

1116
02:00:29,017 --> 02:00:29,984
No.

1117
02:00:30,052 --> 02:00:31,451
You never spoke?

1118
02:00:31,520 --> 02:00:35,456
Once, they asked me over
to discuss the article.

1119
02:00:35,524 --> 02:00:38,015
Who was it
you talked to?

1120
02:00:38,093 --> 02:00:40,220
One of the editors.

1121
02:00:40,295 --> 02:00:42,354
What was his name?

1122
02:00:53,775 --> 02:00:57,006
l don't remember.

1123
02:00:57,079 --> 02:00:59,104
l've no idea.

1124
02:01:01,817 --> 02:01:04,980
What did he look like?

1125
02:01:05,053 --> 02:01:06,816
l can't remember.

1126
02:01:06,889 --> 02:01:10,222
Tell me
the truth, Doctor.

1127
02:01:12,828 --> 02:01:14,728
He was tall...

1128
02:01:14,796 --> 02:01:18,391
with...short, blond hair.

1129
02:01:25,340 --> 02:01:27,900
A little stooped, hmm?

1130
02:01:28,844 --> 02:01:30,243
Perhaps.

1131
02:01:30,312 --> 02:01:34,009
And how did he react?

1132
02:01:34,082 --> 02:01:36,243
What did
he say exactly?

1133
02:01:36,318 --> 02:01:39,754
He asked me
to make some changes.

1134
02:01:39,821 --> 02:01:41,789
So...

1135
02:01:41,857 --> 02:01:47,420
you might have been
manipulated, Doctor.

1136
02:01:48,830 --> 02:01:50,263
Used.

1137
02:01:50,332 --> 02:01:52,800
Whether you
meant to or not,

1138
02:01:52,868 --> 02:01:55,029
your article
contributed to

1139
02:01:55,103 --> 02:01:57,435
the anti-communist
hysteria.

1140
02:01:59,241 --> 02:02:03,940
Nobody requires a doctor
to understand politics.

1141
02:02:09,418 --> 02:02:15,357
Of course, we can't allow
a politically suspicious man

1142
02:02:15,424 --> 02:02:17,949
to operate on brains.

1143
02:02:21,897 --> 02:02:25,958
We have here
another declaration.

1144
02:02:28,870 --> 02:02:31,964
l would
advise you to sign.

1145
02:02:39,381 --> 02:02:41,474
''This temporary error...

1146
02:02:43,385 --> 02:02:47,481
due to bad influences from
so-called intellectuals...

1147
02:02:48,890 --> 02:02:51,825
doesn't in any way
put in doubt

1148
02:02:51,893 --> 02:02:54,862
my faithfulness to
the Communist party

1149
02:02:54,930 --> 02:02:58,366
or my admiration
for the Soviet Union.''

1150
02:02:58,433 --> 02:03:01,368
Of course, Doctor,
it's only a proposition,

1151
02:03:01,436 --> 02:03:02,835
a first draft.

1152
02:03:02,904 --> 02:03:05,873
lf there is something
you want to change...

1153
02:03:05,941 --> 02:03:08,501
after all,
it's your statement.

1154
02:03:10,912 --> 02:03:13,847
Just a paper
to keep in their files.

1155
02:03:13,915 --> 02:03:15,405
lt's nothing.

1156
02:03:15,484 --> 02:03:17,850
Just in case
someone reproaches them

1157
02:03:17,919 --> 02:03:20,513
for letting you
work here.

1158
02:04:42,003 --> 02:04:45,097
Good evening,
Excellency.

1159
02:04:53,515 --> 02:04:55,949
Why do they call him
Excellency?

1160
02:04:56,017 --> 02:04:59,817
He was an ambassador
in Vienna...before.

1161
02:04:59,888 --> 02:05:01,116
Oh.

1162
02:05:16,037 --> 02:05:18,130
Give me a cognac.

1163
02:05:21,042 --> 02:05:22,976
Ah. Ha.

1164
02:05:23,044 --> 02:05:24,944
Are you 18?

1165
02:05:25,013 --> 02:05:25,911
Yes.

1166
02:05:25,981 --> 02:05:30,145
May l see
your identification card?

1167
02:05:34,556 --> 02:05:35,488
Haaa.

1168
02:05:35,557 --> 02:05:37,149
Ugh! Drunk.

1169
02:05:38,827 --> 02:05:40,886
Give me a drink.

1170
02:05:43,098 --> 02:05:45,362
Give me a drink.

1171
02:05:48,036 --> 02:05:50,596
All right.

1172
02:05:50,672 --> 02:05:53,163
You have
beautiful legs!

1173
02:05:54,576 --> 02:05:57,977
l watched you
in the street.

1174
02:06:08,123 --> 02:06:09,249
Ugh.

1175
02:06:23,104 --> 02:06:24,071
Ow!

1176
02:06:24,139 --> 02:06:27,131
Stay here.
l want to look at you.

1177
02:06:27,209 --> 02:06:28,870
l love you!

1178
02:06:28,944 --> 02:06:30,878
Ohhh!

1179
02:06:32,047 --> 02:06:34,311
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

1180
02:06:56,037 --> 02:06:57,470
Madame.

1181
02:06:57,539 --> 02:07:01,839
You have no right
to serve alcohol to minors.

1182
02:07:01,910 --> 02:07:03,741
That was lemonade.

1183
02:07:03,812 --> 02:07:06,576
Do you think
l did not see

1184
02:07:06,648 --> 02:07:09,378
what else you put
into his lemonade?

1185
02:07:09,451 --> 02:07:11,612
What are you
talking about?

1186
02:07:11,686 --> 02:07:15,087
l've been watching you
for some time now.

1187
02:07:15,156 --> 02:07:18,091
Then be grateful
