a general.

455
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:01,946
Like his father before him.

456
00:33:01,946 --> 00:33:04,449
Sons take after
their fathers.

457
00:33:04,449 --> 00:33:08,419
I'm sure you're
a reflection of him.

458
00:33:08,419 --> 00:33:10,421
In a way.

459
00:33:12,423 --> 00:33:14,859
You'd have been
very proud of him.

460
00:33:14,859 --> 00:33:18,363
If only I could be
with him just once more.

461
00:33:20,365 --> 00:33:24,769
That can be arranged.

462
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:28,272
[ Panting ]
Go, go! I'll come for you!

463
00:33:28,272 --> 00:33:29,907
Ow! Ooh!

464
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:38,616
[ Gasping ]
Kill him!

465
00:33:38,616 --> 00:33:41,319
Iolaus! Help me!

466
00:33:43,888 --> 00:33:46,824
[ Grunting ]
Aah!

467
00:34:12,483 --> 00:34:14,952
Shoulda got a bigger stick!

468
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:34,972
Getting that
ol' sinking feeling, huh?

469
00:34:58,329 --> 00:35:00,765
[ Yells Wildly ]

470
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:03,034
Okay, you metalheads! Aah!

471
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:10,441
Incoming!

472
00:35:17,748 --> 00:35:19,984
Now, that rocked.

473
00:35:19,984 --> 00:35:21,986
Leandra.

474
00:35:21,986 --> 00:35:27,291
Big mistake giving that
to the creepy cretin
with the awful aura.

475
00:35:27,725 --> 00:35:32,230
Iagos is my friend.
[ Scoffs ] A guy who calls
you "ugly" to your face?

476
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:36,234
Yeah, that's a real bud.
Besides, it's not true.

477
00:35:36,234 --> 00:35:38,703
You can stop lying.

478
00:35:38,703 --> 00:35:43,141
Hera, my own mother, threw me
out of Olympus because she
couldn't stand the sight of me.

479
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:47,645
Horse-face Hera? There are
no mirrors in her home,
and for one good reason.

480
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:53,084
Besides, beauty's not
just what you look like.
It's also what you are inside.

481
00:35:53,084 --> 00:35:56,587
Whoa.
That's, like, profound.

482
00:35:56,587 --> 00:36:01,559
Of all the Olympian gods,
only I am ugly.

483
00:36:02,059 --> 00:36:04,562
If Zeus had been my father,
maybe my life
would be different.

484
00:36:04,562 --> 00:36:10,067
But you have no idea
what it's like to be judged
on your appearance alone.

485
00:36:10,067 --> 00:36:13,070
Oh, yes, I do.
We have that in common.

486
00:36:17,441 --> 00:36:19,944
It's done.

487
00:36:32,423 --> 00:36:34,926
This was intended for you.

488
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:47,972
You're free to leave.

489
00:36:50,474 --> 00:36:54,478
Actually,
I'm not in any hurry.

490
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:04,388
Good-bye, Aphrodite.
That's a first.

491
00:37:17,768 --> 00:37:20,338
Leandra! No!

492
00:37:20,338 --> 00:37:22,473
[ Leandra Screaming ]

493
00:37:25,643 --> 00:37:28,246
- [ Yelping ]
- Leandra! Hold on!

494
00:37:31,449 --> 00:37:34,552
[ Yelling ]

495
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:39,323
Okay. You have to help.

496
00:37:39,323 --> 00:37:41,826
[ Grunting ]
That's it.

497
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:46,264
Come on.

498
00:37:59,176 --> 00:38:01,178
[ Both Panting ]

499
00:38:02,179 --> 00:38:04,682
You all right?
Yeah. I'm fine.

500
00:38:04,682 --> 00:38:06,984
Thanks.

501
00:38:06,984 --> 00:38:08,986
We're family, right?

502
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:11,856
So we are.

503
00:38:11,856 --> 00:38:14,859
In one day, I lose a son
and gain a grandson.

504
00:38:14,859 --> 00:38:18,863
To think, if Skouros hadn't
wandered off like that,
you wouldn't be alive.

505
00:38:18,863 --> 00:38:20,865
Uh, yeah.

506
00:38:21,365 --> 00:38:26,370
I-- I guess sometimes things
really do work out the way
they're supposed to.

507
00:38:26,871 --> 00:38:31,042
What courage you have.
I'm so proud of you.

508
00:38:35,546 --> 00:38:37,381
Thanks.

509
00:38:41,118 --> 00:38:43,621
You think you can make it back
to Syllabus on your own?
Yes.

510
00:38:43,621 --> 00:38:46,524
Are you going
after Iagos?
Somebody has to.

511
00:38:47,024 --> 00:38:49,427
Please be careful.
Yeah.

512
00:38:57,735 --> 00:39:02,273
Not happy with the decor?
Hey, I think this place smokes.

513
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:07,745
You're still here.
Yeah, I cleared
my afternoon schedule.

514
00:39:07,745 --> 00:39:11,248
Tell me one thing:
Why Leandra?

515
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:17,755
A pale imitation, but...
she reminded me of you.

516
00:39:20,257 --> 00:39:23,260
When Iagos returns with her,
I'll send her back
to the village.

517
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:26,630
Syllabus is free.

518
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:31,135
That's what you wanted
to hear from me, isn't it?
No.

519
00:39:31,135 --> 00:39:35,639
What I want is
the answer to my question.

520
00:39:36,173 --> 00:39:38,142
Do you love me?

521
00:39:40,111 --> 00:39:42,113
For centuries.

522
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:56,660
Okay. This can be easy,
or it can be hard.

523
00:39:56,660 --> 00:40:00,598
- You choose.
- I already have.

524
00:40:00,598 --> 00:40:03,534
[ Laughing ]

525
00:40:05,002 --> 00:40:07,438
Yaah!
No, no. Not there.

526
00:40:07,438 --> 00:40:10,441
Over here.

527
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:20,184
Very good! But how long
will your luck hold out?

528
00:40:23,187 --> 00:40:25,689
[ Laughing ]

529
00:40:25,689 --> 00:40:30,194
A room full of weapons
fit for the gods,
and you choose a broom.

530
00:40:30,194 --> 00:40:32,696
Yeah. Well, I don't wanna
kill you, Iagos.

531
00:40:33,197 --> 00:40:36,700
Then you're unluckyandfoolish.
Not even worth my energy.

532
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:39,170
I'm leaving.

533
00:40:44,074 --> 00:40:47,077
I lied.
[ Laughing ]

534
00:40:51,081 --> 00:40:52,950
Which side of the sword
am I on?

535
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:56,954
You're trying to remember if
I'm right-handed or left-handed.

536
00:40:58,422 --> 00:41:00,891
[ Chuckling ]

537
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:06,363
- Aah!
-Uh!

538
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:15,072
That'd be left-handed.

539
00:41:17,041 --> 00:41:18,976
Kill him now!

540
00:41:23,414 --> 00:41:25,416
Here we go again.

541
00:41:44,068 --> 00:41:46,337
[ Screaming ]

542
00:41:51,609 --> 00:41:53,644
What a waste.

543
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:58,582
[ Sighing ]

544
00:42:01,051 --> 00:42:04,522
You trapped my panther,
bested my shield...

545
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:07,892
and defeated
my armored warriors.

546
00:42:07,892 --> 00:42:09,894
Guess I was on a roll.

547
00:42:09,894 --> 00:42:12,363
Where's Aphrodite?

548
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:17,868
You brought her to me.
And for that,
I'll be forever grateful.

549
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:20,237
[ Aphrodite ]
Me too.
[ Chuckles ]

550
00:42:20,237 --> 00:42:23,240
Sorry I didn't cover your back
with those moves you showed me.
I was busy showing Hephy here...

551
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:26,544
some moves of my own.
Dite, please.

552
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:28,779
- "Dite"?
- The God of Fire.

553
00:42:28,779 --> 00:42:32,283
It only takes one little spark
to start an awesome flame.

554
00:42:32,283 --> 00:42:37,288
- So things are back to normal
  between men and women, right?
- Totally.

555
00:42:37,288 --> 00:42:40,190
I've decided to leave
the action business up to
my big brother Hercules.

556
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:42,526
That's a relief.

557
00:42:42,526 --> 00:42:46,030
Well, I'm gonna go and say
good-bye to my grandmother.

558
00:42:46,463 --> 00:42:49,900
Remember if you or Hercules
ever need any weapons--
Hercules doesn't do weapons.

559
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:53,871
Oh, sweet cheeks.
I already got a petition
from some babe in Parthea.

560
00:42:56,874 --> 00:42:58,876
Evanthea. Huh!

561
00:42:58,876 --> 00:43:01,812
- She wants to see me again.
- Go and make somebody happy.

562
00:43:01,812 --> 00:43:03,314
Yeah.

563
00:43:03,314 --> 00:43:06,250
Or don't you and Hercules
do that either?

564
00:43:09,186 --> 00:43:12,089
[ Laughing ]

565
