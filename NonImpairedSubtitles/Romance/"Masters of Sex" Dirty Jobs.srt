<i>Previously on Masters Of Sex...</i>

2
00:00:03,306 --> 00:00:06,835
Because I wasn't sure when
I would be starting at Memorial,

3
00:00:06,837 --> 00:00:08,565
I haven't yet told Lillian.

4
00:00:08,567 --> 00:00:10,977
Greathouse feels it may not be possible

5
00:00:10,979 --> 00:00:12,749
for you to come over to Memorial.

6
00:00:12,751 --> 00:00:13,924
Great to see you, Bill.

7
00:00:13,926 --> 00:00:16,161
I hope you're treating him
right, Barbara.

8
00:00:16,163 --> 00:00:17,302
Because this one,

9
00:00:17,304 --> 00:00:19,139
he's got a bigger following
than "Gunsmoke."

10
00:00:19,141 --> 00:00:21,076
You, my dear,
are not married to a saint.

11
00:00:21,078 --> 00:00:23,489
You are to keep 100 miles away
from that study.

12
00:00:23,491 --> 00:00:25,789
Unofficially, I am very interested

13
00:00:25,791 --> 00:00:29,071
in what happens behind closed
doors... very, very interested.

14
00:00:29,073 --> 00:00:31,147
Metastasis was always a possibility.

15
00:00:31,149 --> 00:00:33,180
I know what to research now.

16
00:00:33,182 --> 00:00:35,788
I'm going to have to hand the work off

17
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:37,857
to someone who can fight the fight.

18
00:00:37,859 --> 00:00:40,362
You're sterile and yet engaging
in fertility treatments?

19
00:00:40,364 --> 00:00:41,871
It's not my problem.

20
00:00:41,873 --> 00:00:44,447
Last I looked, your new
job came with all the zeroes

21
00:00:44,449 --> 00:00:46,154
on that check my husband wrote.

22
00:00:46,156 --> 00:00:47,789
<i>Attention all hospital staff.</i>

23
00:00:47,791 --> 00:00:50,799
<i>Dr. Austin Langham
has spent the last two months</i>

24
00:00:50,801 --> 00:00:53,840
<i>fornicating
with his sister-in-law.</i>

25
00:00:53,842 --> 00:00:55,209
Thought he would do the trick.

26
00:00:55,211 --> 00:00:56,643
Having our son.

27
00:00:56,645 --> 00:00:59,416
I know my husband
was reticent about children.

28
00:00:59,418 --> 00:01:02,323
Who ever heard of a grown man
being afraid of his own child?

29
00:01:02,325 --> 00:01:04,127
I think you might have misunderstood

30
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:05,368
what happened between us.

31
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:07,603
Of course we're not having
an affair, Virginia.

32
00:01:07,605 --> 00:01:09,576
We never were.
I'm a happily married man.

33
00:01:09,578 --> 00:01:10,818
Continuing the work is a good idea

34
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:14,422
but only if you understand the terms.

35
00:01:14,424 --> 00:01:15,895
I agree.

36

Sync and corrections by n17t01

37
00:02:03,031 --> 00:02:06,002
If sex is merely
a vehicle for procreation,

38
00:02:06,004 --> 00:02:08,107
then clearly, the end of fertility

39
00:02:08,109 --> 00:02:09,876
marks the end of sexual desire.

40
00:02:09,878 --> 00:02:11,814
Yet Freud believed that menopause

41
00:02:11,816 --> 00:02:13,511
led to an increase in female libido.

42
00:02:13,513 --> 00:02:16,017
As usual, Dr. Freud
presents no empirical evidence

43
00:02:16,019 --> 00:02:17,154
to substantiate his claim.

44
00:02:17,156 --> 00:02:19,059
He wasn't all wrong, though.

45
00:02:19,061 --> 00:02:20,355
The data does show

46
00:02:20,357 --> 00:02:23,702
certain physiological changes
in women over 50...

47
00:02:23,704 --> 00:02:26,840
a longer period of foreplay
needed for lubrication,

48
00:02:26,842 --> 00:02:29,778
fewer vaginal contractions
in the orgasm phase.

49
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:32,148
When did you see
all of these participants?

50
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,910
Oh, those are only a small sampling.

51
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:37,788
So you've resumed the study.

52
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:39,252
- Yes, of course.
- Without me.

53
00:02:39,254 --> 00:02:40,587
I did everything I could, Virginia.

54
00:02:40,589 --> 00:02:42,756
The board just wasn't impressed
by your application.

55
00:02:42,758 --> 00:02:44,800
Uh, I-I don't understand.

56
00:02:44,802 --> 00:02:47,438
Try to see it from their perspective...

57
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,711
Limited experience,
no higher education.

58
00:02:49,713 --> 00:02:51,345
I tried to go back to school.

59
00:02:51,347 --> 00:02:53,378
You tried,
but you didn't see it through.

60
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:55,450
- You chose me instead.
- I chose the work.

61
00:02:55,452 --> 00:02:58,358
Virginia, you thought
it was about the work.

62
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,823
I always knew the truth.

63
00:02:59,825 --> 00:03:03,369
And that became apparent in
your application, so I'm sorry,

64
00:03:03,371 --> 00:03:06,066
but you really only have
yourself to blame.

65
00:03:06,068 --> 00:03:08,074
Because?

66
00:03:08,076 --> 00:03:09,642
For starters?

67
00:03:09,644 --> 00:03:14,719
Under "Current occupation,"
you wrote, "Mistress."

68
00:03:24,703 --> 00:03:25,703
You're up.

69
00:03:28,177 --> 00:03:29,208
How long was I...?

70
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:30,705
An hour, maybe.

71
00:03:30,707 --> 00:03:32,839
An hour?
Why didn't you wake me?

72
00:03:32,841 --> 00:03:35,109
You looked like you needed to sleep.

73
00:03:35,111 --> 00:03:37,550
Did you know you sleep
with your mouth open,

74
00:03:37,552 --> 00:03:38,879
like a little baby bird?

75
00:03:38,881 --> 00:03:41,182
You don't sleep here.

76
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:43,351
Or read.
This isn't vacation.

77
00:03:43,353 --> 00:03:45,220
I told the sitter
I'd be home by 10:00.

78
00:03:45,222 --> 00:03:47,451
It's only 9:15.
We still have...

79
00:03:47,453 --> 00:03:49,123
Please get dressed.

80
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:51,956
You still need to get
the study files out of my trunk.

81
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,864
<i>Oh, goodbye, Silky.</i>

82
00:03:59,866 --> 00:04:03,166
<i>And don't wait for me to write
another story about you.</i>

83
00:04:03,168 --> 00:04:04,301
<i>Drop in anytime.</i>

84
00:04:04,303 --> 00:04:06,669
<i>Goodbye, Mr. Thompson.</i>

85
00:04:06,671 --> 00:04:09,237
<i>Aren't you gonna escort me to the door?</i>

86
00:04:17,614 --> 00:04:20,552
<i>Mr. Thompson,
my wife didn't mean anything.</i>

87
00:04:20,554 --> 00:04:22,920
<i>We've been married for 25 years.</i>

88
00:04:22,922 --> 00:04:24,656
<i>You're not gonna shoot me.</i>

89
00:04:24,658 --> 00:04:26,321
<i>Why should I?</i>

90
00:04:26,323 --> 00:04:28,490
<i>If you want to get out of it,
shoot yourself.</i>

91
00:05:00,424 --> 00:05:03,294
It's a mess, but it's all there...

92
00:05:03,296 --> 00:05:06,558
Intake forms, instrument
readings, sexual histories.

93
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,597
I could have used these the other day.

94
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:12,534
Barbara tried to make fliers for
the study riddled with typos.

95
00:05:12,536 --> 00:05:13,870
Any response yet?

96
00:05:13,872 --> 00:05:15,902
Oh, the phone hasn't stopped ringing.

97
00:05:15,904 --> 00:05:17,343
I have seven interviews

98
00:05:17,345 --> 00:05:20,445
with prospective participants
tomorrow, six the next day.

99
00:05:20,447 --> 00:05:22,876
I meant any response from Greathouse

100
00:05:22,878 --> 00:05:24,475
about my position in the study.

101
00:05:24,477 --> 00:05:29,745
Uh, why, h-he can't
authorize me to hire you

102
00:05:29,747 --> 00:05:30,985
until the board signs off.

103
00:05:30,987 --> 00:05:33,114
Has he even brought it up to them?

104
00:05:33,116 --> 00:05:35,618
I'm gonna make sure he does.

105
00:05:37,756 --> 00:05:38,954
You should pull your car around

106
00:05:38,956 --> 00:05:40,255
so we can start loading these.

107
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:41,590
Well, m-maybe
you should hold on to them.

108
00:05:41,592 --> 00:05:44,759
Someone has to... put them back
into some kind of order.

109
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:46,556
I was under the impression

110
00:05:46,558 --> 00:05:48,460
that someone was called your secretary.

111
00:05:48,462 --> 00:05:49,797
Oh, Barbara can barely alphabetize.

112
00:05:49,799 --> 00:05:51,902
Besides, you know better than anyone

113
00:05:51,904 --> 00:05:53,638
how all the pieces fit together.

114
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:56,868
I-I want you to stay connected
to the work.

115
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:00,339
So I-I'm not qualified
as a researcher,

116
00:06:00,341 --> 00:06:04,071
but it's fine for me to play
secretary in my free time.

117
00:06:04,073 --> 00:06:06,712
Virginia, I'm as unhappy with
this situation as you are.

118
00:06:06,714 --> 00:06:10,743
Are you...
Are you taking... diet pills?

119
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:12,614
I'm selling them.

120
00:06:12,616 --> 00:06:14,350
You're holding on to them for a friend.

121
00:06:14,352 --> 00:06:15,814
No, I'm selling them.

122
00:06:15,816 --> 00:06:17,981
Without the extra money from the study,

123
00:06:17,983 --> 00:06:19,988
I can barely afford to pay my rent.

124
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:22,621
I need to make a living, Bill.

125
00:06:41,206 --> 00:06:44,539
This morning we're driving in,

126
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:47,945
and the parking attendant says,
"Morning, Mrs. Moretti."

127
00:06:47,947 --> 00:06:52,215
And it takes me a solid minute
to realize he meant me.

128
00:06:52,217 --> 00:06:55,645
I mean, your whole life, you're
walking around as Betty Dimello

129
00:06:55,647 --> 00:06:57,411
and the next day, you're married

130
00:06:57,413 --> 00:07:00,383
and someone's calling you
some other lady's name.

131
00:07:00,385 --> 00:07:02,152
It's like if, all of a sudden,

132
00:07:02,154 --> 00:07:06,352
I started calling you
Dr. Lipschitz.

133
00:07:06,354 --> 00:07:07,351
Mrs. Moretti.

134
00:07:07,353 --> 00:07:09,349
You know, it makes me feel like

135
00:07:09,351 --> 00:07:11,322
I'm pretending to be somebody I'm not.

136
00:07:11,324 --> 00:07:14,517
Know what I mean?

137
00:07:19,761 --> 00:07:22,760
They had a free subscription
offer, so I figured, "Why not?"

138
00:07:22,762 --> 00:07:24,694
But then I stumbled on this article.

139
00:07:24,696 --> 00:07:28,164
Turns out a new baby
is very traumatic for a man,

140
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:31,033
as though his home has been transformed

141
00:07:31,035 --> 00:07:32,864
into an oversized playpen.

142
00:07:32,866 --> 00:07:35,863
Messy, noisy.

143
00:07:35,865 --> 00:07:37,533
There are smells.

144
00:07:37,535 --> 00:07:39,500
Which explains why the moment
Bill walks through the door,

145
00:07:39,502 --> 00:07:41,542
the first thing he does
is take out the diaper pail.

146
00:07:42,741 --> 00:07:47,343
It also explains why Bill needs
to feel things are calm at home,

147
00:07:47,345 --> 00:07:50,140
orderly, unchanged.

148
00:07:50,142 --> 00:07:51,843
No bottles on the counters,

149
00:07:51,845 --> 00:07:54,242
no pacifiers stuck between cushions.

150
00:07:54,244 --> 00:07:56,714
It's also why today is important.

151
00:07:56,716 --> 00:07:58,483
I mean, I know it seems
like just a silly luncheon,

152
00:07:58,485 --> 00:08:01,722
but these are the wives
of Bill's new colleagues.

153
00:08:01,724 --> 00:08:03,354
If things go well here,

154
00:08:03,356 --> 00:08:06,365
they report as much
back to their husbands.

155
00:08:06,367 --> 00:08:09,626
That helps Bill at work
as well as at home.

156
00:08:09,628 --> 00:08:13,158
Is that a Dixie cup on his...?

157
00:08:14,233 --> 00:08:17,260
It's a trick I learned from
changing my brother's diapers.

158
00:08:17,262 --> 00:08:19,382
You'll lose your eyes if
you're not careful with boys.

159
00:08:20,498 --> 00:08:22,529
Maybe I should have axed
you before I put it on.

160
00:08:22,531 --> 00:08:25,506
Asked me...
before you put it on.

161
00:08:25,508 --> 00:08:28,399
We talked about this before, remember?

162
00:08:28,401 --> 00:08:30,535
Don't worry.
You'll get it.

163
00:08:33,714 --> 00:08:35,976
We should have a sample pap smear kit

164
00:08:35,978 --> 00:08:38,346
for Dr. Papanikolau to bring
to Florida with him.

165
00:08:38,348 --> 00:08:40,312
I put one together last week.

166
00:08:42,383 --> 00:08:44,382
Several... sample kits.

167
00:08:44,384 --> 00:08:46,920
At least three or four, even,
to be safe.

168
00:08:46,922 --> 00:08:50,220
Four seems reasonable, don't you think?

169
00:08:50,222 --> 00:08:51,891
He's only in St. Louis
once a year

170
00:08:51,893 --> 00:08:53,189
for the Thalberg conference.

171
00:08:53,191 --> 00:08:56,458
Does he prefer coffee or tea?

172
00:08:56,460 --> 00:09:00,095
Tea...
with cream and a little...

173
00:09:00,097 --> 00:09:01,599
with a little...

174
00:09:01,601 --> 00:09:03,965
the little squares
and the sugar's in...

175
00:09:03,967 --> 00:09:05,261
Sugar cubes.

176
00:09:06,534 --> 00:09:08,102
You're just nervous about tomorrow.

177
00:09:08,104 --> 00:09:09,807
They did name the pap smear

178
00:09:09,809 --> 00:09:12,008
after Dr. Papanikolau,
after all.

179
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:14,673
It makes sense that
you would want to impress him.

180
00:09:14,675 --> 00:09:17,179
I'm not trying to impress anyone.

181
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:18,851
Dr. Papanikolau happens to be

182
00:09:18,853 --> 00:09:21,312
a very respected figure
in the field. That's all.

183
00:09:21,314 --> 00:09:25,118
His support for our program
would be enormously useful.

184
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,987
Especially to you,
as you continue with our work.

185
00:09:28,989 --> 00:09:32,388
DePaul, Lillian?

186
00:09:40,664 --> 00:09:41,861
Save my seat.

187
00:10:24,566 --> 00:10:26,039
How long have you worked here?

188
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:28,405
Three years in March.

189
00:10:28,407 --> 00:10:30,773
I'm over at Maternity.

190
00:10:30,775 --> 00:10:31,773
Oh, my girlfriend Peggy
used to work there.

191
00:10:31,775 --> 00:10:32,877
How do you like it?

192
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:34,509
Truthfully?

193
00:10:34,511 --> 00:10:37,443
The stress of working in a hospital...

194
00:10:37,445 --> 00:10:41,313
Some days I just want to curl up
with a piece of chocolate cake.

195
00:10:41,315 --> 00:10:42,912
I know what you mean.

196
00:10:42,914 --> 00:10:45,446
We're supposed to give these
to patients for nausea.

197
00:10:45,448 --> 00:10:47,886
I can imagine it's tough

198
00:10:47,888 --> 00:10:50,516
being surrounded
by so much suffering every day.

199
00:10:50,518 --> 00:10:53,157
Especially when everyone's so skinny.

200
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:55,790
I did try the grapefruit diet,

201
00:10:55,792 --> 00:10:57,695
but all it did was give me cavities.

202
00:10:57,697 --> 00:10:59,896
That is the problem with fad diets.

203
00:10:59,898 --> 00:11:02,001
T-they promise you
the moon and the stars,

204
00:11:02,003 --> 00:11:04,336
but you just end up feeling
hungry all the time.

205
00:11:04,338 --> 00:11:08,144
That's why I started
using Cal-o-Metric.

206
00:11:10,745 --> 00:11:13,279
We'll be following the
exact same protocol as you did

207
00:11:13,281 --> 00:11:16,474
when you participated in the
study at Washington University.

208
00:11:16,476 --> 00:11:18,174
But what would I tell my husband?

209
00:11:18,176 --> 00:11:19,541
What did you tell him before?

210
00:11:19,543 --> 00:11:22,644
That there were two doctors,
and one of them was a lady.

211
00:11:22,646 --> 00:11:25,078
That's the only reason
he let me do it, Dr. Masters.

212
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:29,219
I'm sorry, but if it's just
going to be you here, alone,

213
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:33,788
watching... I'm sorry.

214
00:11:38,029 --> 00:11:39,461
Part of the study?

215
00:11:39,463 --> 00:11:40,765
Not anymore.

216
00:11:40,767 --> 00:11:42,997
Oh, shame.

217
00:11:42,999 --> 00:11:44,835
Yes,
and without Mrs. Johnson,

218
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:47,037
we can look forward to a lot
more qualified volunteers

219
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,438
declining to participate.

220
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,975
Mrs. Johnson is instrumental
in this part of the process.

221
00:11:50,977 --> 00:11:52,878
Nobody else puts people
at their ease...

222
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,677
Bill, I get it.

223
00:11:54,679 --> 00:11:57,010
You and I... we've been at this
a long time.

224
00:11:57,012 --> 00:11:59,313
You reach a certain point
in your career...

225
00:11:59,315 --> 00:12:01,176
same routine day in and day out.

226
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:04,216
It's like if you never see
another torn perineum again,

227
00:12:04,218 --> 00:12:05,582
it'll be too soon.

228
00:12:05,584 --> 00:12:09,054
So, you start a sex study,
get a research assistant.

229
00:12:09,056 --> 00:12:12,856
Mrs. Johnson
is indispensable to this study.

230
00:12:12,858 --> 00:12:15,726
She may seem indispensable
to you, but to the board,

231
00:12:15,728 --> 00:12:17,630
she's, uh, a overpriced secretary.

232
00:12:17,632 --> 00:12:20,827
Things aren't always
what they seem, are they?

233
00:12:20,829 --> 00:12:23,925
For instance, Barbara doesn't
seem to know the first thing

234
00:12:23,927 --> 00:12:25,662
about secretarial work, and yet,

235
00:12:25,664 --> 00:12:29,396
apparently,
she's essential... to you.

236
00:12:31,427 --> 00:12:32,666
I'm simply asking

237
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:35,003
that Mrs. Johnson be brought on
to this study

238
00:12:35,005 --> 00:12:39,066
because she is essential...
to the work.

239
00:12:41,538 --> 00:12:44,009
I'll float the idea
at tomorrow's board meeting,

240
00:12:44,011 --> 00:12:45,011
see what they think.

241
00:13:07,991 --> 00:13:11,160
What?
They're out of ambrosia?

242
00:13:11,162 --> 00:13:15,359
You know, last year,
when you left the study,

243
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:17,294
I thought to myself, "Why?

244
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:20,702
Why would Virginia
leave the work she loves

245
00:13:20,704 --> 00:13:22,000
to go back to typing memos?"

246
00:13:22,002 --> 00:13:24,069
Not to mention,
"Why would Bill let her go?"

247
00:13:24,071 --> 00:13:27,307
What are you talking about, Austin?

248
00:13:27,309 --> 00:13:30,738
Now I'm thinking, "What
complicates every relationship?

249
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:34,345
What splits two people up?"

250
00:13:35,747 --> 00:13:38,618
Elise is now staying at her mother's

251
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:41,755
across the river in Alton.

252
00:13:41,757 --> 00:13:44,152
So when it's my turn
for an overnight with the kids,

253
00:13:44,154 --> 00:13:46,055
I drive to Alton, where I pick them up,

254
00:13:46,057 --> 00:13:50,682
then take them to
the Chancery Park Plaza Hotel.

255
00:13:50,684 --> 00:13:55,354
I saw you there last night with Bill.

256
00:13:55,356 --> 00:13:58,826
Well, you should have said something.

257
00:13:58,828 --> 00:14:01,425
We could have all gotten a drink.

258
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:09,205
Bill and I have decided to go
ahead and publish the study.

259
00:14:09,207 --> 00:14:12,172
Now, it's still in the early stages...

260
00:14:12,174 --> 00:14:15,178
Compiling the data, drafting the texts.

261
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,246
Bill's not welcome here, obviously.

262
00:14:17,248 --> 00:14:19,012
I'm not welcome at his hospital.

263
00:14:19,014 --> 00:14:22,455
And we can't work late hours
at his house with the new baby.

264
00:14:22,457 --> 00:14:25,357
We can't exactly discuss
sex research at my house

265
00:14:25,359 --> 00:14:28,429
with my kids there,
so we work out of the hotel.

266
00:14:30,695 --> 00:14:32,695
Then why did you two
stop working together?

267
00:14:34,866 --> 00:14:38,830
Bill thought that we were ready
to present to the faculty,

268
00:14:38,832 --> 00:14:41,459
and I said we had not done
enough to prepare them

269
00:14:41,461 --> 00:14:43,363
for what they were about to hear,

270
00:14:43,365 --> 00:14:46,170
let alone the sight
of a pulsating vagina...

271
00:14:47,468 --> 00:14:48,802
...on a projection screen.

272
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:52,443
So we had a terrible fight,
and in the end, I quit.

273
00:14:53,675 --> 00:14:56,272
And then after the debacle
with the presentation,

274
00:14:56,274 --> 00:14:58,913
Bill admitted that he was wrong
and he apologized

275
00:14:58,915 --> 00:15:00,744
and he asked me to come back.

276
00:15:00,746 --> 00:15:02,815
So that's it?

277
00:15:02,817 --> 00:15:05,320
Yes, that's it.

278
00:15:14,534 --> 00:15:15,764
And we took the children

279
00:15:15,766 --> 00:15:17,764
to see The Music Man
with Robert Preston.

280
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:20,835
Oh, I hear that is fabulous!

281
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:22,401
- It's fabulous.
- Ohh!

282
00:15:22,403 --> 00:15:25,038
Oh, I couldn't drag Bill
to a Broadway musical.

283
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,773
He'd probably bring a journal
on uterine fibroids to read

284
00:15:27,775 --> 00:15:28,901
during the slow parts.

285
00:15:30,975 --> 00:15:32,406
So, how does he like the new hospital?

286
00:15:32,408 --> 00:15:33,941
Oh, he couldn't be happier.

287
00:15:33,943 --> 00:15:38,844
And that study of his...
Is that still happening, too?

288
00:15:38,846 --> 00:15:40,648
I bet you know all the secrets.

289
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:42,542
- Uh...
- Libby, do tell us

290
00:15:42,544 --> 00:15:44,581
the most delicious thing you've learned

291
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:46,009
from all of his experiments.

292
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:48,208
Uh, well, um...

293
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:52,277
I actually worked on the study
myself for a bit in his office,

294
00:15:52,279 --> 00:15:55,315
where I got to see firsthand
just how boring it all is.

295
00:15:55,317 --> 00:15:58,585
The charts and the graphs and
the incomprehensible diagram.

296
00:16:02,283 --> 00:16:03,585
Someone had a nice long nap.

297
00:16:04,787 --> 00:16:06,593
Oh, my goodness.

298
00:16:06,595 --> 00:16:09,688
Has that adorable creature
been here this whole time?

299
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:13,356
Oh, he is gorgeous, Libby.

300
00:16:13,358 --> 00:16:16,596
And she is so wonderful with him.

301
00:16:16,598 --> 00:16:18,335
- Can I hold?
- Mm-hmm.

302
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:22,137
Ahh.

303
00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:25,375
Where did you learn
to be so great with children?

304
00:16:25,377 --> 00:16:27,144
You're so young.

305
00:16:27,146 --> 00:16:29,977
Oh, well... my mama passed
when I was 10, and...

306
00:16:29,979 --> 00:16:31,251
Mm-hmm.

307
00:16:31,253 --> 00:16:32,786
...I had to bring up
my brothers and sisters.

308
00:16:32,788 --> 00:16:36,047
But even before that, you know,
I had baby cousins in Joplin...

309
00:16:36,049 --> 00:16:37,686
Coral, she doesn't
want your family history.

310
00:16:37,688 --> 00:16:38,551
She was just being polite.

311
00:16:38,553 --> 00:16:40,488
She axed.

312
00:16:42,825 --> 00:16:46,128
Either I'm... I'm losing
my mind, or I'm... His hair.

313
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:49,600
Is there something crawling in it?

314
00:16:52,065 --> 00:16:54,102
All my sales reports are there.

315
00:16:58,572 --> 00:17:01,773
I sold over $40 worth
of products this week.

316
00:17:01,775 --> 00:17:04,610
It's almost double
what I did the week before.

317
00:17:04,612 --> 00:17:06,609
Hmm.
Be still my heart.

318
00:17:06,611 --> 00:17:09,973
I did all of that
without using your sales script,

319
00:17:09,975 --> 00:17:11,173
by the way.

320
00:17:11,175 --> 00:17:12,477
No wonder your numbers stink.

321
00:17:12,479 --> 00:17:15,147
I don't...
I don't feel comfortable

322
00:17:15,149 --> 00:17:16,547
reading from a script

323
00:17:16,549 --> 00:17:19,250
that deliberately makes women
feel bad about themselves.

324
00:17:19,252 --> 00:17:21,714
And yet women who feel
great about themselves

325
00:17:21,716 --> 00:17:27,894
don't buy diet products, which
leaves us with a... conundrum.

326
00:17:27,896 --> 00:17:30,198
Listen, if you really want
to get good at this...

327
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,461
- Oh, I don't.
- Oh.

328
00:17:31,463 --> 00:17:33,164
I don't want to get good at this.

329
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:37,035
Selling diet pills may be enough
for most housewives

330
00:17:37,037 --> 00:17:39,739
that walk through your door,
but I already have a career.

331
00:17:39,741 --> 00:17:41,267
Oh, you're following your dreams.

332
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:42,804
Yes.

333
00:17:42,806 --> 00:17:46,045
At the moment, I need something
to supplement my income, but...

334
00:17:46,047 --> 00:17:50,384
Have you ever heard
of William Elvis Sloan?

335
00:17:50,386 --> 00:17:52,458
He invented Cal-o-Metric?

336
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:55,593
He came up with
how to make a toilet flush.

337
00:17:55,595 --> 00:17:56,960
Was that his calling?

338
00:17:56,962 --> 00:17:59,327
Did he wake up every morning
tickled pink

339
00:17:59,329 --> 00:18:00,759
and skipping off to work?

340
00:18:00,761 --> 00:18:01,959
Probably not.

341
00:18:01,961 --> 00:18:06,063
But he died a very rich man.

342
00:18:06,065 --> 00:18:08,500
So, sure, follow your dreams.

343
00:18:08,502 --> 00:18:11,101
It's a lovely slogan for a life

344
00:18:11,103 --> 00:18:13,369
most people can't afford to live.

345
00:18:13,371 --> 00:18:14,400
But who knows?

346
00:18:14,402 --> 00:18:18,500
Maybe you're special.

347
00:18:33,144 --> 00:18:35,247
I just asked for the check.

348
00:18:35,249 --> 00:18:36,447
I assumed you weren't coming.

349
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:39,449
I had to turn in my sales report.

350
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:40,921
Of course.

351
00:18:40,923 --> 00:18:44,086
I wouldn't want our work to
interfere with your diet pills.

352
00:18:44,088 --> 00:18:46,852
Austin saw us last
night leaving our room together.

353
00:18:46,854 --> 00:18:49,983
A-apparently, his wife is staying
with her mother in Alton,

354
00:18:49,985 --> 00:18:52,651
so when he takes the kids,
he stays at this hotel.

355
00:18:52,653 --> 00:18:53,852
Jesus.

356
00:18:53,854 --> 00:18:56,058
It's not a problem.
I handled it.

357
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,919
Says who?

358
00:18:57,921 --> 00:18:59,918
If someone like Austin
can walk through here,

359
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,158
that means anyone can.

360
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,957
So luckily, there's nothing strange

361
00:19:02,959 --> 00:19:05,258
about two colleagues having
a drink in a hotel lobby.

362
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:06,792
Virginia, I am a married man.

363
00:19:06,794 --> 00:19:10,529
You do understand what it would
mean if this were to get out.

364
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:14,526
I do.

365
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:17,630
Which means it would
probably be imprudent

366
00:19:17,632 --> 00:19:20,437
for us to head upstairs, wouldn't it?

367
00:19:27,746 --> 00:19:30,771
It's a mess, I know.

368
00:19:30,773 --> 00:19:32,982
I wasn't expecting you home until late.

369
00:19:32,984 --> 00:19:35,385
I, uh...
I hope you ate something.

370
00:19:35,387 --> 00:19:37,354
I haven't made a thing for dinner.

371
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:42,332
Everything's fine.

372
00:19:42,334 --> 00:19:45,301
We found lice in Johnny's hair,

373
00:19:45,303 --> 00:19:46,702
but I got a book from the library,

374
00:19:46,704 --> 00:19:48,237
and we just need to wash everything...

375
00:19:48,239 --> 00:19:50,805
all the fabric in the house...
and it shouldn't be a problem.

376
00:19:50,807 --> 00:19:51,973
The baby's crying.

377
00:19:51,975 --> 00:19:53,605
I know the baby's crying.

378
00:19:53,607 --> 00:19:55,279
The baby has been crying all day.

379
00:19:55,281 --> 00:19:57,112
I can't get the baby to stop crying.

380
00:19:59,215 --> 00:20:00,981
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

381
00:20:00,983 --> 00:20:03,115
You have enough to worry about.

382
00:20:03,117 --> 00:20:05,314
Now the girl brings in lice.

383
00:20:05,316 --> 00:20:06,818
- Coral?
- Who else?

384
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:09,186
I've never had lice.
You've never had lice.

385
00:20:09,188 --> 00:20:11,322
No one that we know has ever had lice.

386
00:20:11,324 --> 00:20:13,594
You don't have to wash everything.

387
00:20:15,027 --> 00:20:17,864
Libby, just the baby's clothes
and his blankets, then tomorrow,

388
00:20:17,866 --> 00:20:19,264
you can scrub his hair

389
00:20:19,266 --> 00:20:20,925
with the medicated shampoo
they sell at the supermarket.

390
00:20:20,927 --> 00:20:25,563
These are just a few harmless insects.

391
00:20:25,565 --> 00:20:28,097
They'll be gone in a day or two.

392
00:20:28,099 --> 00:20:30,630
See?

393
00:20:30,632 --> 00:20:34,164
It's so much nicer when we can
sort these things out together.

394
00:20:38,699 --> 00:20:42,270
I'll, uh, take out the diaper pail.

395
00:20:48,668 --> 00:20:50,642
Initial aim of the program

396
00:20:50,644 --> 00:20:52,705
is to expand access to early screening

397
00:20:52,707 --> 00:20:55,472
through a systematic outreach
effort to physicians

398
00:20:55,474 --> 00:20:58,850
and to... to...

399
00:20:58,852 --> 00:20:59,914
Hospitals.

400
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:01,785
And eventually, we hope to establish

401
00:21:01,787 --> 00:21:04,020
a research facility
at Washington University

402
00:21:04,022 --> 00:21:05,892
to develop new methods of detection

403
00:21:05,894 --> 00:21:07,692
and treatments of cervical cancer.

404
00:21:07,694 --> 00:21:09,028
But that's still years in the future.

405
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:11,857
I am creating a research center

406
00:21:11,859 --> 00:21:13,894
of my own at the University of Miami.

407
00:21:13,896 --> 00:21:15,694
- Are you really?
- Mm-hmm.

408
00:21:15,696 --> 00:21:16,694
How very interesting.

409
00:21:16,696 --> 00:21:17,830
Oh.

410
00:21:20,367 --> 00:21:22,131
This is the prototype

411
00:21:22,133 --> 00:21:24,395
for the testing kit
we'll be sending out.

412
00:21:24,397 --> 00:21:26,930
We've included a skort frim slip.

413
00:21:26,932 --> 00:21:29,400
Pardon?

414
00:21:29,402 --> 00:21:30,672
A skort frim slip.

415
00:21:30,674 --> 00:21:33,165
There's a short film strip.

416
00:21:34,502 --> 00:21:37,339
Yes. It is short.

417
00:21:37,341 --> 00:21:39,274
Do you have any questions?

418
00:21:47,002 --> 00:21:48,040
Hey, uh, Doc?

419
00:21:48,042 --> 00:21:49,367
Do you time it

420
00:21:49,369 --> 00:21:51,703
so we arrive at the exact
same moment every morning,

421
00:21:51,705 --> 00:21:54,540
or is it just the heavens
conspiring against me?

422
00:21:54,542 --> 00:21:56,939
Actually, uh, we wait
till we see your car pull in.

423
00:21:56,941 --> 00:21:58,978
Morning!

424
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:02,281
Gene came to give a donation.

425
00:22:02,283 --> 00:22:03,608
Well, you've been more
than generous already.

426
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:05,173
Not that kind of donation.

427
00:22:05,175 --> 00:22:07,842
Uh, poor Gene's been getting antsy

428
00:22:07,844 --> 00:22:10,144
with all this testing we're doing.

429
00:22:10,146 --> 00:22:12,847
He's been asking
when we're gonna move on.

430
00:22:12,849 --> 00:22:14,078
Move on to...?

431
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,350
Well, Betts says
you're good on her end,

432
00:22:15,352 --> 00:22:17,949
but you just need a sample
of my, uh... swimmers.

433
00:22:17,951 --> 00:22:19,951
Pardon my French.

434
00:22:21,422 --> 00:22:23,793
- Ready, Moretti?
- Yeah.

435
00:22:27,957 --> 00:22:29,355
Good morning, Dr. Masters.

436
00:22:29,357 --> 00:22:31,394
Betty, I... Betty,
I think it's best if you wait...

437
00:22:31,396 --> 00:22:32,730
Don't worry.
I can take care of this.

438
00:22:32,732 --> 00:22:34,195
If I could just have a...

439
00:22:34,197 --> 00:22:36,266
You really know your way
around here, don't you, honey?

440
00:22:36,268 --> 00:22:38,295
- I'm very observant.
- I really must insist.

441
00:22:38,297 --> 00:22:39,630
All right, reading material.

442
00:22:39,632 --> 00:22:41,303
Here. You always had a thing
for Ava Gardner.

443
00:22:41,305 --> 00:22:42,966
Dr. Masters, could I just...

444
00:22:42,968 --> 00:22:44,238
All right, don't have
too much fun in there.

445
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,367
Could I just have just a...

446
00:22:45,369 --> 00:22:47,174
Barbara, what is it?!

447
00:22:47,176 --> 00:22:48,637
Dr. Greathouse
would like to know

448
00:22:48,639 --> 00:22:49,973
what time tonight's study's starting.

449
00:22:49,975 --> 00:22:52,676
He would like to be there.

450
00:22:52,678 --> 00:22:54,381
7:00.

451
00:22:54,383 --> 00:22:57,916
But make sure he knows this
evening's area of focus, please.

452
00:22:57,918 --> 00:22:58,915
Uh, uh, yes.

453
00:22:58,917 --> 00:23:01,651
We'll be looking at men...

454
00:23:01,653 --> 00:23:03,882
with enlarged prostates,

455
00:23:03,884 --> 00:23:08,288
primarily elderly men
engaged in auto manipulation.

456
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:09,488
Auto... I'm... I'm sorry.

457
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:10,919
Old men masturbating!

458
00:23:13,855 --> 00:23:15,053
I know you're gonna say...

459
00:23:15,055 --> 00:23:16,655
- In my office.
- Mm-hmm.

460
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:22,562
Uh, I'm almost done in here.

461
00:23:22,564 --> 00:23:23,867
So maybe I could take the baby now?

462
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:25,132
Actually, there's something

463
00:23:25,134 --> 00:23:26,605
that I would like to speak
to you about.

464
00:23:26,607 --> 00:23:29,404
Uh, I need you to use this tonight.

465
00:23:29,406 --> 00:23:30,905
What is it?

466
00:23:30,907 --> 00:23:32,271
It's a special shampoo.

467
00:23:32,273 --> 00:23:35,636
It, um... It gets rid
of anything that's...

468
00:23:35,638 --> 00:23:37,539
The eggs, or, um...

469
00:23:39,265 --> 00:23:41,533
Everyone that you live with...
your family...

470
00:23:41,535 --> 00:23:42,732
they should use it, too.

471
00:23:42,734 --> 00:23:45,368
I don't have lice,
Mrs. Masters.

472
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:46,999
They didn't come from me.

473
00:23:47,001 --> 00:23:50,237
I never said that they did.

474
00:24:03,744 --> 00:24:05,942
All you have to do is look in there

475
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:07,509
and tell him he's got bum sperm.

476
00:24:07,511 --> 00:24:09,610
And... and this
I would divine somehow

477
00:24:09,612 --> 00:24:10,745
by staring into a cup.

478
00:24:10,747 --> 00:24:12,610
Put it under a magnifying glass.

479
00:24:12,612 --> 00:24:14,448
It's a shame you didn't
pursue a career in medicine

480
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:15,784
because you obviously
have a head for it.

481
00:24:15,786 --> 00:24:17,512
He won't know the difference.

482
00:24:17,514 --> 00:24:20,150
I know, and I will not
tell a patient he is sterile

483
00:24:20,152 --> 00:24:21,317
when I know for a fact

484
00:24:21,319 --> 00:24:23,548
that the only reason
he can't have children

485
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:25,955
is because his wife
underwent a tubal ligation.

486
00:24:25,957 --> 00:24:28,156
You want to get all high and mighty?

487
00:24:28,158 --> 00:24:29,492
Fine.
Let's end it now.

488
00:24:29,494 --> 00:24:31,958
You tell him I'm infertile.
Tell him the truth.

489
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,767
You tell him.

490
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:37,471
Hey.
Sorry to interrupt.

491
00:24:37,473 --> 00:24:40,374
I, uh...
I crossed the finish line.

492
00:24:44,682 --> 00:24:46,912
It's all just...

493
00:24:49,616 --> 00:24:51,646
Well, it's cruel.

494
00:24:51,648 --> 00:24:57,283
Ohh, you're out there
in the john making baby batter,

495
00:24:57,285 --> 00:25:01,719
while in here, the doc gets the
results from my very last test,

496
00:25:01,721 --> 00:25:03,779
and it turns out I'm the culprit.

497
00:25:08,094 --> 00:25:10,957
I don't even know what to say.

498
00:25:10,959 --> 00:25:15,166
Nobody does.
Only Betty knows.

499
00:25:15,168 --> 00:25:17,998
You know, your whole life,

500
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,571
you think all you got to do
is find the right fella.

501
00:25:22,573 --> 00:25:25,001
Getting knocked up,
that's the easy part.

502
00:25:25,003 --> 00:25:28,807
Then to find out your body's
just not cut out for it.

503
00:25:28,809 --> 00:25:30,503
Doc.

504
00:25:31,407 --> 00:25:33,678
Is there anything that we can do?

505
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:36,013
I'm afraid not.

506
00:25:36,015 --> 00:25:38,910
Nothing at all?

507
00:25:41,149 --> 00:25:42,181
Uh, this is a real blow.

508
00:25:42,183 --> 00:25:47,620
I... Uh, thank you for trying.

509
00:25:47,622 --> 00:25:51,687
I didn't do anything.
Really.

510
00:25:53,624 --> 00:25:59,788
I think it's only right that,
uh, you dispose of this, Betty.

511
00:26:04,861 --> 00:26:08,597
Hey. You okay?
'Cause I'm not sure I am.

512
00:26:08,599 --> 00:26:12,540
Uh, I'm,
you know... devastated.

513
00:26:12,542 --> 00:26:13,540
Hey.

514
00:26:13,542 --> 00:26:16,841
But at least we still got each other.

515
00:26:16,843 --> 00:26:18,336
Ah, hell.
Cashier.

516
00:26:18,338 --> 00:26:19,607
Need to settle up the bill.

517
00:26:19,609 --> 00:26:21,005
No.

518
00:26:21,007 --> 00:26:24,042
Um, Dr. Masters isn't gonna
charge us for this morning.

519
00:26:24,044 --> 00:26:25,739
No, we got to pay
for all the fertility tests

520
00:26:25,741 --> 00:26:27,379
and the treatments that you had.

521
00:26:27,381 --> 00:26:29,644
No, Gene, honey, let's just go home

522
00:26:29,646 --> 00:26:31,716
and start the healing process.

523
00:26:31,718 --> 00:26:33,348
Bets. We're here.

524
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:34,819
Let's just get it over with now.

525
00:26:42,719 --> 00:26:44,822
Your taxi should be here any minute.

526
00:26:46,822 --> 00:26:50,157
Dr. Papanikolau,
if I may speak frankly,

527
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:54,097
you chair the committee for
the Williams Prize, correct?

528
00:26:54,099 --> 00:26:55,394
I do.

529
00:26:55,396 --> 00:26:58,497
Well, Dr. DePaul
would never say this,

530
00:26:58,499 --> 00:27:00,429
but that kind of endorsement...

531
00:27:00,431 --> 00:27:02,301
it would be invaluable to our program,

532
00:27:02,303 --> 00:27:04,500
not to mention what
it would mean to Dr. DePaul

533
00:27:04,502 --> 00:27:06,561
on a more personal level...
coming from you.

534
00:27:06,563 --> 00:27:09,198
You see, nobody has stood
behind this program.

535
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,472
The administration
had to be strongarmed

536
00:27:11,474 --> 00:27:13,735
into offering even
a modicum of support.

537
00:27:13,737 --> 00:27:16,408
Everything that Dr. DePaul
has accomplished here,

538
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:19,375
she has had to do on her own
with no help, no guidance.

539
00:27:19,377 --> 00:27:22,047
I did not expect to be
impressed this morning.

540
00:27:22,049 --> 00:27:23,382
To be honest,

541
00:27:23,384 --> 00:27:26,516
I did not even remember
Dr... DePaul.

542
00:27:26,518 --> 00:27:30,180
But I am always pleased years later

543
00:27:30,182 --> 00:27:35,091
to hear that a student
considered me their mentor.

544
00:27:35,093 --> 00:27:37,827
No, I didn't say "Mentor."

545
00:27:37,829 --> 00:27:39,722
And neither did Dr. DePaul.

546
00:27:39,724 --> 00:27:42,130
She says she never had a mentor,
since mentors, I believe,

547
00:27:42,132 --> 00:27:43,794
were reserved for the male students.

548
00:27:44,931 --> 00:27:49,232
And you may not have remembered
her, but I guarantee you

549
00:27:49,234 --> 00:27:50,735
you will remember her now

550
00:27:50,737 --> 00:27:53,567
because what she has done
here... this program,

551
00:27:53,569 --> 00:27:57,574
all on her own...
it is remarkable.

552
00:27:57,576 --> 00:28:00,605
Yes.
You are right about that.

553
00:28:00,607 --> 00:28:04,979
Well, then, I hope you will
take that into consideration

554
00:28:04,981 --> 00:28:07,714
as you make your selections
for the Williams Prize.

555
00:28:17,783 --> 00:28:22,656
Now, uh, you control
the device yourself...

556
00:28:24,498 --> 00:28:27,129
The speed, intensity, depth.

557
00:28:27,131 --> 00:28:29,168
Ah, it's freezing.

558
00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:33,596
Oh, uh, my partner usually warms it

559
00:28:33,598 --> 00:28:35,194
with a hot towel.

560
00:28:35,196 --> 00:28:37,633
I-I've completely forgotten.

561
00:28:43,606 --> 00:28:49,165
Well, uh... The friction between
the device and the vaginal wall

562
00:28:49,167 --> 00:28:52,267
should, uh, gradually increase
the temperature.

563
00:29:19,548 --> 00:29:21,282
Oh, I thought we were doing prostates.

564
00:29:21,284 --> 00:29:23,421
Last-minute scheduling change.

565
00:29:23,423 --> 00:29:25,890
I see you opted
for old and fat instead.

566
00:29:25,892 --> 00:29:26,858
Hmm.

567
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:28,361
Post-menopausal, actually.

568
00:29:28,363 --> 00:29:29,498
Oh.

569
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:32,166
Well, pretend I'm not here.

570
00:29:32,168 --> 00:29:35,434
I'll be invisible.
Fly on the wall.

571
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:45,182
Thar she blows.

572
00:29:46,583 --> 00:29:48,915
Sorry, uh, no comments from
the peanut gallery. I know.

573
00:29:48,917 --> 00:29:51,221
Have you spoken to the
board yet about my assistant?

574
00:29:51,223 --> 00:29:53,021
Uh, yes, I did, actually.

575
00:29:53,023 --> 00:29:56,260
I spoke to them at length about
Mrs. Johnson just this morning,

576
00:29:56,262 --> 00:29:59,427
and, uh, they haven't made
a decision yet, obviously,

577
00:29:59,429 --> 00:30:01,229
but, uh, they seem open to it.

578
00:30:01,231 --> 00:30:02,630
Well, I'm happy to speak to them myself

579
00:30:02,632 --> 00:30:03,629
to answer any questions.

580
00:30:03,631 --> 00:30:05,402
Steady on, pal.

581
00:30:05,404 --> 00:30:09,000
It's a process.
It takes time.

582
00:30:09,002 --> 00:30:12,306
But trust me.
We'll get there.

583
00:30:21,013 --> 00:30:22,516
Knock, knock.

584
00:30:24,222 --> 00:30:25,355
I noticed you were burning
the midnight oil.

585
00:30:25,357 --> 00:30:26,418
Thought I'd say hello.

586
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:27,584
Hello.

587
00:30:27,586 --> 00:30:31,283
Do you know what the worst
part about this divorce is?

588
00:30:31,285 --> 00:30:32,649
It's not fighting with lawyers

589
00:30:32,651 --> 00:30:34,616
or driving a half an hour
to see your kids

590
00:30:34,618 --> 00:30:36,255
or watching your wife of 12 years

591
00:30:36,257 --> 00:30:37,855
turn into some kind
of a she-wolf.

592
00:30:37,857 --> 00:30:40,625
It's eating potato chips for dinner.

593
00:30:44,424 --> 00:30:47,602
I just keep fantasizing
about Elise's cooking.

594
00:30:47,604 --> 00:30:51,234
Beef Stroganoff, tuna noodle casserole,

595
00:30:51,236 --> 00:30:53,443
jiffy corn casserole,
cheeseburger casserole.

596
00:30:53,445 --> 00:30:56,906
Are you just going
to sit there, talking?

597
00:30:58,978 --> 00:31:02,111
Because if so, I need a drink.

598
00:31:05,618 --> 00:31:07,783
I didn't even know
that water polo was a sport,

599
00:31:07,785 --> 00:31:09,686
let alone that
it was my favorite sport.

600
00:31:17,527 --> 00:31:20,431
Mm, I have a stack of exams to grade.

601
00:31:20,433 --> 00:31:22,830
Give Virginia the answer sheet.

602
00:31:22,832 --> 00:31:23,765
Let her do it.

603
00:31:23,767 --> 00:31:24,997
One more.

604
00:31:30,136 --> 00:31:31,510
To Virginia.

605
00:31:31,512 --> 00:31:33,311
Virginia.

606
00:31:38,785 --> 00:31:41,185
Funny.

607
00:31:41,187 --> 00:31:43,921
The second I met Virginia,
I thought I had her pegged.

608
00:31:43,923 --> 00:31:46,996
Just another one of these women
unwilling to do the hard work.

609
00:31:46,998 --> 00:31:48,965
Ready to latch on to the first man

610
00:31:48,967 --> 00:31:51,597
that can take them
to the next rung of the ladder.

611
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:53,702
Well, then, that just proves

612
00:31:53,704 --> 00:31:55,741
you are a good judge of character.

613
00:31:55,743 --> 00:31:57,303
She's closer to you than...
than anyone.

614
00:31:59,445 --> 00:32:01,308
How long have you known?

615
00:32:03,508 --> 00:32:05,981
So... long.

616
00:32:05,983 --> 00:32:07,485
Very long.

617
00:32:07,487 --> 00:32:09,483
I saw them last night
leaving the hotel.

618
00:32:09,485 --> 00:32:10,617
Virginia, God bless her,

619
00:32:10,619 --> 00:32:12,478
tried... tried to give me
some baloney story

620
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,917
about how they're publishing the study,

621
00:32:14,919 --> 00:32:16,453
working out of the hotel.

622
00:32:16,455 --> 00:32:20,281
She used to do this thing every
once in a while in the lab.

623
00:32:20,283 --> 00:32:23,089
She would lean in
and fix Bill's bow tie,

624
00:32:23,091 --> 00:32:25,885
just sort of straighten it out,
you know?

625
00:32:25,887 --> 00:32:29,451
There is a fence around Bill Masters...

626
00:32:29,453 --> 00:32:31,218
chain link with barbed wire.

627
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:34,353
Nobody gets through that.
Nobody gets close.

628
00:32:34,355 --> 00:32:38,190
But Virginia... Virginia
would just waltz right through.

629
00:32:38,192 --> 00:32:39,559
I think back now.

630
00:32:39,561 --> 00:32:41,561
I mean, how could I have missed
something so obvious?

631
00:32:41,563 --> 00:32:42,696
How could I not have known

632
00:32:42,698 --> 00:32:44,618
that they were sleeping together
the entire time?

633
00:32:53,404 --> 00:32:56,738
Tatti Greathouse gave me
a recipe for osso bucco.

634
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:59,739
She says it's better
than the one at Bella Rossa.

635
00:32:59,741 --> 00:33:01,873
I may not be home
until after 9:00.

636
00:33:01,875 --> 00:33:04,249
Oh. I thought we could
have a late supper.

637
00:33:04,251 --> 00:33:06,281
We can close our eyes,
pretend we're in Florence.

638
00:33:06,283 --> 00:33:07,283
Here, I'll take that.

639
00:33:08,556 --> 00:33:10,187
Good morning, Mrs. Masters.

640
00:33:10,189 --> 00:33:11,386
Good morning, Dr. Masters.

641
00:33:11,388 --> 00:33:12,418
Good morning.

642
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:16,718
Hello, Coral.
I see, um...

643
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:20,019
Well, I see that your hair is
the same as it was yesterday.

644
00:33:20,021 --> 00:33:24,619
Oh. Yes, Mrs. Masters.
I feel like it suits me.

645
00:33:24,621 --> 00:33:27,251
I'm referring
to the shampoo that I gave you.

646
00:33:27,253 --> 00:33:28,690
Did you use it?

647
00:33:28,692 --> 00:33:31,322
My brother checked.
He didn't find nothing.

648
00:33:31,324 --> 00:33:33,659
Anything.
He didn't find anything.

649
00:33:36,163 --> 00:33:39,230
It costs me $4
to get my hair done every week.

650
00:33:39,232 --> 00:33:40,935
I can't afford to mess it up.

651
00:33:40,937 --> 00:33:42,967
So you didn't use the shampoo,

652
00:33:42,969 --> 00:33:45,933
even though you told me...
you promised me that you would.

653
00:33:45,935 --> 00:33:48,573
Dr. Masters,
I don't have lice.

654
00:33:48,575 --> 00:33:49,740
I swear I don't.

655
00:33:49,742 --> 00:33:51,572
My brother said negroes
can't even get it.

656
00:33:51,574 --> 00:33:53,878
Coral, this conversation
is between you and me.

657
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,342
Her brother is right.

658
00:33:55,344 --> 00:33:57,509
Negroes do have tightly coiled,
low-density hair,

659
00:33:57,511 --> 00:33:59,442
which makes it
very inhospitable for lice.

660
00:33:59,444 --> 00:34:01,911
I read about it in the, uh,
Wellford Journal of Medicine.

661
00:34:01,913 --> 00:34:04,448
So it does seem unlikely
she would have them.

662
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:06,448
Unlikely is not impossible.

663
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:08,855
I don't see why we need
to involve Dr. Masters

664
00:34:08,857 --> 00:34:10,223
in this discussion at all.

665
00:34:14,522 --> 00:34:16,751
I'll go get him.

666
00:34:31,898 --> 00:34:33,464
Is everything all right?

667
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,566
I cheated in college.

668
00:34:42,766 --> 00:34:44,004
Calculus.

669
00:34:44,006 --> 00:34:46,772
I could never get my head
around calculus.

670
00:34:46,774 --> 00:34:50,446
No matter how many hours I
studied, I couldn't crack a B+.

671
00:34:50,448 --> 00:34:52,444
And I was a straight A student.

672
00:34:52,446 --> 00:34:54,949
I figured medical schools
couldn't turn away

673
00:34:54,951 --> 00:34:57,980
a straight A student,
even if she were a woman.

674
00:34:57,982 --> 00:35:00,951
So I bought the final exam
from the previous year

675
00:35:00,953 --> 00:35:04,294
from a rather unscrupulous
graduate student named Marvin

676
00:35:04,296 --> 00:35:05,422
for $10.

677
00:35:09,066 --> 00:35:11,632
I'm impressed.

678
00:35:11,634 --> 00:35:14,470
Lillian DePaul breaks the rules.

679
00:35:16,273 --> 00:35:20,838
It was a shortcut.
That's all.

680
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:23,376
Does it negate the work
I've done since?

681
00:35:23,378 --> 00:35:26,753
Does one shortcut diminish
everything that comes after?

682
00:35:29,321 --> 00:35:30,416
So...?

683
00:35:30,418 --> 00:35:33,552
So... that's my secret.

684
00:35:33,554 --> 00:35:35,762
What's yours?

685
00:35:35,764 --> 00:35:37,964
My secret?

686
00:35:37,966 --> 00:35:40,196
I don't...
I don't have any secrets.

687
00:35:40,198 --> 00:35:41,564
I don't believe you.

688
00:35:54,381 --> 00:35:59,222
Virginia, you've seen me at my worst...

689
00:35:59,224 --> 00:36:02,190
lying naked on a hospital sheet,

690
00:36:02,192 --> 00:36:05,861
limping to the car after radiation.

691
00:36:05,863 --> 00:36:11,997
I've shared... nearly everything
with you... too much, even.

692
00:36:11,999 --> 00:36:16,070
It seems only right
that you should share with me.

693
00:36:20,607 --> 00:36:24,045
I...

694
00:36:26,246 --> 00:36:28,519
Honestly, Lillian...

695
00:36:31,554 --> 00:36:34,994
I'm not that interesting.

696
00:36:48,547 --> 00:36:51,789
Coral, could you come here, please?

697
00:36:54,324 --> 00:36:56,188
This relationship is about trust.

698
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:58,692
I leave you in my house
every day with my child,

699
00:36:58,694 --> 00:37:00,196
- and if I can't trust you...
- Mrs. Masters.

700
00:37:00,198 --> 00:37:02,428
What if something,
God forbid, happened to Johnny?

701
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:04,533
How do I know that you would
tell me the truth?

702
00:37:04,535 --> 00:37:06,806
How can I trust anything
that you say to me anymore?

703
00:37:06,808 --> 00:37:08,302
I'm sorry.

704
00:37:08,304 --> 00:37:10,638
I need you to sit down, please.

705
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:13,214
Mrs. Masters,
I'll use the shampoo.

706
00:37:13,216 --> 00:37:14,910
No, Coral, that is the point.

707
00:37:14,912 --> 00:37:16,916
I can't trust you anymore
to do it yourself.

708
00:37:19,014 --> 00:37:21,989
If you don't sit down, Coral,
you'll have to leave,

709
00:37:21,991 --> 00:37:24,084
and you will not be welcome back.

710
00:37:34,022 --> 00:37:36,188
Put your head back, please.

711
00:37:38,956 --> 00:37:41,692
The water warm enough?

712
00:37:43,828 --> 00:37:46,164
We need to be on the same side.

713
00:37:46,166 --> 00:37:50,202
If you have a problem
with something, you come to me.

714
00:37:50,204 --> 00:37:55,532
Dr. Masters is a busy man, and
we don't need to involve him.

715
00:37:55,534 --> 00:37:58,236
He's not a part of this.

716
00:37:58,238 --> 00:38:02,740
You and I... we need
to stick together, okay?

717
00:38:02,742 --> 00:38:05,506
I hope you can understand that.

718
00:38:22,531 --> 00:38:24,098
Please.

719
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:26,265
To get your hair redone.
It's my treat.

720
00:38:38,408 --> 00:38:40,176
I appreciate you meeting me

721
00:38:40,178 --> 00:38:42,008
on such short notice,
Dr. Papanikolau.

722
00:38:42,010 --> 00:38:43,480
I don't have much time.

723
00:38:43,482 --> 00:38:44,711
My plane leaves in one hour.

724
00:38:44,713 --> 00:38:46,150
This won't take long.

725
00:38:46,152 --> 00:38:49,652
I called because
I would like to ask you

726
00:38:49,654 --> 00:38:52,148
to take my program with you...

727
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:53,620
to Miami, to your new research center.

728
00:38:53,622 --> 00:38:56,853
I'm sorry if there's
been a misunderstanding,

729
00:38:56,855 --> 00:38:59,522
Lillian, but my staff
is already in place.

730
00:38:59,524 --> 00:39:01,826
No, I'm not asking for a job.

731
00:39:04,229 --> 00:39:07,763
After some consideration...

732
00:39:07,765 --> 00:39:10,571
I've come to the conclusion
that this university

733
00:39:10,573 --> 00:39:13,003
simply doesn't have
the proper personnel

734
00:39:13,005 --> 00:39:15,203
to fully realize the program.

735
00:39:16,644 --> 00:39:20,112
You understand
that if I were to oversee this,

736
00:39:20,114 --> 00:39:24,374
I would keep you informed of
any major decisions, of course.

737
00:39:24,376 --> 00:39:26,845
But in terms
of the day-to-day management...

738
00:39:26,847 --> 00:39:30,549
Once I give you the program, my
role in it will be finished.

739
00:39:36,422 --> 00:39:37,821
I understand.

740
00:39:47,270 --> 00:39:49,606
Ah. Bill.

741
00:39:49,608 --> 00:39:50,869
So?

742
00:39:50,871 --> 00:39:52,341
So, what?

743
00:39:52,343 --> 00:39:54,038
So, uh, what's on the menu tonight?

744
00:39:55,677 --> 00:39:58,474
You know, actually,
I was looking for you, Doug,

745
00:39:58,476 --> 00:40:04,248
uh, since I haven't had a chance
to apologize yet for last night.

746
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:08,050
I realized afterwards I had
completely forgotten to warn you

747
00:40:08,052 --> 00:40:10,290
about the transference effect.

748
00:40:10,292 --> 00:40:13,386
Does, uh, transference
involve attractive women?

749
00:40:14,692 --> 00:40:16,858
Well, yes, it can, but not necessarily.

750
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:22,561
Observation of sexual activity
can produce

751
00:40:22,563 --> 00:40:26,538
a kind of, um, tension
in the observers.

752
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:28,570
The researchers can find themselves

753
00:40:28,572 --> 00:40:33,073
experiencing certain
uninvited erotic sensations.

754
00:40:33,075 --> 00:40:36,114
Now, this can happen
between a man and a woman.

755
00:40:36,116 --> 00:40:39,282
It can also happen
between a man and another man.

756
00:40:42,014 --> 00:40:43,779
I'm not quite sure I understand.

757
00:40:43,781 --> 00:40:46,347
Well, I've been doing
this for a long time, Doug,

758
00:40:46,349 --> 00:40:48,681
so I'm immune to, uh,
the transference effect myself,

759
00:40:48,683 --> 00:40:53,456
but I have seen other men
in that small, confined space.

760
00:40:53,458 --> 00:40:57,487
Well, the danger is high,

761
00:40:57,489 --> 00:41:00,695
and for those male observers
that do get drawn in,

762
00:41:00,697 --> 00:41:06,692
well... they often don't come out
the other side.

763
00:41:06,694 --> 00:41:11,927
At least not the same way
they, uh, went in.

764
00:41:11,929 --> 00:41:14,664
You mean like in wrestling.

765
00:41:14,666 --> 00:41:17,906
Something like that.

766
00:41:29,315 --> 00:41:30,755
You're nervous.

767
00:41:30,757 --> 00:41:32,084
How can you tell?

768
00:41:32,086 --> 00:41:35,589
Slight generalized vasocongestion
in your face and chest,

769
00:41:35,591 --> 00:41:37,694
mild fasciculation in the hands, feet.

770
00:41:39,199 --> 00:41:42,629
You're flushed and... trembling.

771
00:41:46,104 --> 00:41:47,605
Is that bad?

772
00:41:50,509 --> 00:41:52,214
Uh...

773
00:41:56,849 --> 00:42:00,657
Honest to God, Bill, this is
better than my bachelor party.

774
00:42:06,396 --> 00:42:07,628
Step outside, Doug.

775
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:09,235
Sure.

776
00:42:15,275 --> 00:42:16,803
Yes?

777
00:42:16,805 --> 00:42:20,039
This is a scientific study,

778
00:42:20,041 --> 00:42:23,143
not a-a stag film
in a frat house.

779
00:42:23,145 --> 00:42:25,279
Your colleagues are
very interested in your work.

780
00:42:25,281 --> 00:42:26,814
I-I think you should
appreciate that.

781
00:42:26,816 --> 00:42:28,549
Get them out of here.

782
00:42:28,551 --> 00:42:30,847
Look, I know
that Bart Scully treated you

783
00:42:30,849 --> 00:42:32,118
like the second coming,

784
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:34,650
but here, in this hospital,
you're my employee.

785
00:42:34,652 --> 00:42:37,522
And you have grossly
misjudged me if you think

786
00:42:37,524 --> 00:42:40,258
I'm gonna allow those baboons
to sit in my exam room

787
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:42,291
slurping chop suey, mocking my work.

788
00:42:42,293 --> 00:42:43,458
The terms of my employment,

789
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:45,459
the terms between you and me
are changing now.

790
00:42:45,461 --> 00:42:48,628
You will clear my exam room,

791
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:51,604
and you will never get near it again.

792
00:42:51,606 --> 00:42:54,369
And you will authorize
Mrs. Johnson's hiring

793
00:42:54,371 --> 00:42:56,002
starting tomorrow morning.

794
00:42:56,004 --> 00:43:00,309
Now, let me tell you
how it works with secretaries.

795
00:43:00,311 --> 00:43:03,746
You don't promote them to lofty
positions above their pay grade

796
00:43:03,748 --> 00:43:06,344
or give them titles
like "Research Assistant."

797
00:43:06,346 --> 00:43:09,154
I didn't even mention
your assistant to the board,

798
00:43:09,156 --> 00:43:10,920
and you should thank me for that

799
00:43:10,922 --> 00:43:13,813
because I'm keeping you
from being perceived as a man

800
00:43:13,815 --> 00:43:16,717
that only thinks with his cock
and not with his head.

801
00:43:18,622 --> 00:43:20,692
Now, as far as your study goes,

802
00:43:20,694 --> 00:43:23,695
your colleagues are on your side.

803
00:43:23,697 --> 00:43:25,633
So relax.

804
00:43:40,048 --> 00:43:41,814
You care for one, Bill?

805
00:43:41,816 --> 00:43:43,781
They're delicious.
Not that spicy.

806
00:43:48,884 --> 00:43:50,988
- Hey!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

807
00:43:50,990 --> 00:43:52,556
What the hell?!

808
00:43:52,558 --> 00:43:54,859
- Ohh!
- What the fuck?!

809
00:43:54,861 --> 00:43:57,260
Uhh!

810
00:43:59,368 --> 00:44:00,368
Take it easy.

811
00:44:01,667 --> 00:44:03,708
By the time I'm off the phone
tomorrow morning,

812
00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:05,981
there's not gonna be a single
hospital in the Midwest

813
00:44:05,983 --> 00:44:08,223
that's gonna let you so much
as step through their doors!

814
00:44:23,863 --> 00:44:25,696
These need to be mimeographed

815
00:44:25,698 --> 00:44:27,527
and sent to Dr. Papanikolau's
office at Cornell

816
00:44:27,529 --> 00:44:28,832
as soon as possible.

817
00:44:28,834 --> 00:44:30,754
He requested the files for our program?

818
00:44:32,173 --> 00:44:34,339
Maybe he wants to share them
with the committee

819
00:44:34,341 --> 00:44:35,409
for the Williams Prize.

820
00:44:35,411 --> 00:44:36,810
Actually, Dr. Papanikolau

821
00:44:36,812 --> 00:44:38,347
will be bringing the program with him

822
00:44:38,349 --> 00:44:39,812
to his new research center in Miami.

823
00:44:39,814 --> 00:44:41,611
What do you mean?

824
00:44:41,613 --> 00:44:43,283
You'll need to speak to someone

825
00:44:43,285 --> 00:44:44,452
in the audiovisual department

826
00:44:44,454 --> 00:44:46,251
to make duplicates of the film strip.

827
00:44:46,253 --> 00:44:47,955
You gave him the program?

828
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:55,734
Why didn't you tell me about this?

829
00:44:55,736 --> 00:44:57,505
I'm telling you right now.

830
00:44:57,507 --> 00:44:59,540
After you've made your decision?

831
00:44:59,542 --> 00:45:03,013
I don't need to consult you about
the course of my research.

832
00:45:03,015 --> 00:45:04,276
Your research?!

833
00:45:04,278 --> 00:45:07,819
We're partners.
I-I believed it.

834
00:45:07,821 --> 00:45:10,422
I worked like a dog to get
this program off the ground!

835
00:45:10,424 --> 00:45:12,455
I recommended you
for the Williams Prize!

836
00:45:12,457 --> 00:45:13,854
I didn't ask you to do that.

837
00:45:13,856 --> 00:45:15,828
Well, I did it anyway!
For you!

838
00:45:15,830 --> 00:45:19,995
Papanikolau... he'll put
his name on your work!

839
00:45:19,997 --> 00:45:21,994
You won't even be a footnote!

840
00:45:21,996 --> 00:45:23,730
I didn't go into medicine

841
00:45:23,732 --> 00:45:25,533
to see my name on a study, Virginia.

842
00:45:43,150 --> 00:45:45,779
Loraine.
Virginia Johnson.

843
00:45:45,781 --> 00:45:47,484
We met last summer at the block party.

844
00:45:47,486 --> 00:45:48,821
Of course.
Are you still at Maternity?

845
00:45:48,823 --> 00:45:49,990
I am.

846
00:45:49,992 --> 00:45:52,316
Although I've recently
begun transitioning

847
00:45:52,318 --> 00:45:53,588
to a new line of work.

848
00:45:53,590 --> 00:45:56,419
I'm the new neighborhood
ambassador for Cal-o-Metric.

849
00:45:56,421 --> 00:46:00,163
Oh. This isn't one
of those fad diets, is it?

850
00:46:00,165 --> 00:46:02,128
My sister tried
the cabbage-soup one.

851
00:46:02,130 --> 00:46:04,527
She ended up so bloated,
we called her The Hindenburg.

852
00:46:04,529 --> 00:46:07,927
No, I can assure you,
Cal-o-Metric is not a fad at all.

853
00:46:07,929 --> 00:46:10,200
No, our trademark nutritional
formula is based

854
00:46:10,202 --> 00:46:12,368
on only the most
cutting-edge science.

855
00:46:12,370 --> 00:46:15,500
Well, good luck with it.

856
00:46:15,502 --> 00:46:17,205
Let me ask you something, Loraine.

857
00:46:17,207 --> 00:46:21,110
When you see yourself
in the mirror, how do you feel?

858
00:46:21,112 --> 00:46:22,509
How do you feel?

859
00:46:22,511 --> 00:46:25,048
I feel great.

860
00:46:25,050 --> 00:46:27,051
Well, you're lucky, then.

861
00:46:27,053 --> 00:46:28,755
I don't know many women that do.

862
00:46:28,757 --> 00:46:30,995
Well, I'll tell you who does.

863
00:46:30,997 --> 00:46:32,860
A woman who's confident in her figure.

864
00:46:32,862 --> 00:46:34,732
A woman like that feels great.

865
00:46:34,734 --> 00:46:37,467
In fact, a woman like that
feels fantastic.

866
00:46:37,469 --> 00:46:40,802
But a woman who's not so sure?

867
00:46:40,804 --> 00:46:43,467
Who's maybe put on a pound
or two over the years

868
00:46:43,469 --> 00:46:46,041
or noticed the slightest sag
here and there,

869
00:46:46,043 --> 00:46:48,578
wonders why her husband
doesn't look at her

870
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:49,641
quite the way he used to.

871
00:46:49,643 --> 00:46:54,348
Or even the checkout boy
who used to stare openly,

872
00:46:54,350 --> 00:46:56,744
but now just looks straight past
her as if she's not even there.

873
00:46:56,746 --> 00:46:59,753
You know, a woman like that...

874
00:46:59,755 --> 00:47:02,350
a woman like that
doesn't feel fantastic at all.

875
00:47:06,888 --> 00:47:09,361
This could be the start
of a brand-new you.

876
00:47:09,363 --> 00:47:12,201
I know it was for me.

877
00:47:35,287 --> 00:47:36,686
Bill.

878
00:47:36,688 --> 00:47:39,255
I need to talk to you.

879
00:47:39,257 --> 00:47:40,486
I hate to tell you guys this,

880
00:47:40,488 --> 00:47:43,358
but your kid's got a bad case
of the cutes!

881
00:47:44,464 --> 00:47:46,830
Dr. Langham decided
to drop by.

882
00:47:46,832 --> 00:47:47,861
Isn't that nice?

883
00:47:47,863 --> 00:47:50,227
I'm in major need of advice, Bill.

884
00:47:50,229 --> 00:47:51,532
I got this new patient,
real head-scratcher,

885
00:47:51,534 --> 00:47:52,934
right up your alley.

886
00:47:52,936 --> 00:47:55,901
Well, the skeletal
system is not exactly my...

887
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:58,274
Libby also invited me to dinner.

888
00:47:58,276 --> 00:48:00,937
She said the two magic words...
veal and shanks.

889
00:48:00,939 --> 00:48:02,241
How could I resist?

890
00:48:02,243 --> 00:48:05,041
Plus I picked up a few
Montecristos this weekend.

891
00:48:05,043 --> 00:48:06,841
You care to join me outside?

892
00:48:06,843 --> 00:48:09,314
I don't smoke.

893
00:48:09,316 --> 00:48:10,716
Why don't you join me, Bill?

894
00:48:12,788 --> 00:48:14,221
Do you want to go see mommy?

895
00:48:14,223 --> 00:48:15,591
I know.

896
00:48:15,593 --> 00:48:16,622
There.

897
00:48:18,629 --> 00:48:20,060
Aw.

898
00:48:20,062 --> 00:48:21,693
Okay.

899
00:48:21,695 --> 00:48:25,034
I did try to make
the heavenly ham loaf first.

900
00:48:25,036 --> 00:48:28,368
It was a Betty Crocker recipe
and everything.

901
00:48:28,370 --> 00:48:30,629
Oh, who, by the way, is a phony.

902
00:48:30,631 --> 00:48:33,667
Did you know that?

903
00:48:33,669 --> 00:48:36,531
Betty Crocker is some
advertising idea dreamed up

904
00:48:36,533 --> 00:48:39,142
by some suits sitting
in a fancy boardroom.

905
00:48:39,144 --> 00:48:41,175
Not a real person at all.

906
00:48:41,177 --> 00:48:42,942
It was a woman.

907
00:48:44,815 --> 00:48:46,954
A woman came up with Betty Crocker.

908
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:53,363
Well, you would know being
in the food business.

909
00:48:54,693 --> 00:48:56,733
And I guess you would be
the expert on phony Bettys.

910
00:48:58,465 --> 00:49:00,032
Okay.

911
00:49:02,499 --> 00:49:05,107
I deserve that.

912
00:49:05,109 --> 00:49:09,273
But just so you know,
I'm not going anywhere.

913
00:49:09,275 --> 00:49:11,873
So when you're done
extracting your pound of flesh,

914
00:49:11,875 --> 00:49:13,008
I'll be here.

915
00:49:13,010 --> 00:49:15,946
You knew you couldn't have kids.

916
00:49:15,948 --> 00:49:19,116
You knew before we married,
before we met.

917
00:49:20,287 --> 00:49:21,557
Why didn't you just tell me?

918
00:49:21,559 --> 00:49:22,956
Because you never would have married me

919
00:49:22,958 --> 00:49:24,554
- if you knew the truth.
- You know that?!

920
00:49:24,556 --> 00:49:26,688
I know what you saw
when you first met me...

921
00:49:26,690 --> 00:49:27,958
a good Christian girl at church

922
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:29,254
who'd have good Christian babies.

923
00:49:29,256 --> 00:49:30,621
I didn't meet you at church.

924
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:31,989
Of course you did.
Remember?

925
00:49:31,991 --> 00:49:36,032
It was Palm Sunday potluck
and I bumped into you

926
00:49:36,034 --> 00:49:38,370
and your coleslaw fell
into my pocketbook and I...

927
00:49:38,372 --> 00:49:39,569
It was before that.

928
00:49:44,109 --> 00:49:48,451
I have always been shy with girls.

929
00:49:48,453 --> 00:49:51,484
Always had trouble talking to them.

930
00:49:51,486 --> 00:49:56,125
So I thought, you know...

931
00:49:56,127 --> 00:50:00,693
go to a... go to a-a brothel.

932
00:50:00,695 --> 00:50:08,340
You know, maybe there
I could... learn, you know?

933
00:50:08,342 --> 00:50:13,508
I never met a girl
who was nice to me like that.

934
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:15,876
And I didn't want to leave.

935
00:50:15,878 --> 00:50:18,580
I was so scared that I
would never see you again.

936
00:50:18,582 --> 00:50:21,119
And then when I walked
into that church that morning,

937
00:50:21,121 --> 00:50:26,786
you were standing right there,
and I knew we were meant to be.

938
00:50:29,459 --> 00:50:31,859
I never thought you were
a good Christian girl.

939
00:50:31,861 --> 00:50:34,165
I just thought you were
the love of my life.

940
00:50:54,618 --> 00:50:57,153
I will admit it's an acquired taste.

941
00:50:57,155 --> 00:50:59,225
I've always liked the way it looks.

942
00:50:59,227 --> 00:51:01,626
Gives me sort of
a Hemingway air, I think.

943
00:51:01,628 --> 00:51:06,267
So, what advice can I give you?

944
00:51:06,269 --> 00:51:09,033
Actually, Bill, there's some
advice I'd like to give you.

945
00:51:09,035 --> 00:51:11,169
Do you know why I married Elise?

946
00:51:14,943 --> 00:51:16,405
I thought it would cure me.

947
00:51:16,407 --> 00:51:17,636
No more wandering eye.

948
00:51:17,638 --> 00:51:19,708
No more chasing ass like a teenager.

949
00:51:19,710 --> 00:51:21,378
It would be like magic, you know?

950
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:23,842
As soon as I put the ring
on my finger, abracadabra,

951
00:51:23,844 --> 00:51:25,284
all that stuff would disappear,

952
00:51:25,286 --> 00:51:28,149
and, well, it would just be me and her.

953
00:51:28,151 --> 00:51:32,128
I screwed a dental hygienist
named Gerty three months later.

954
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:33,561
Hated myself for it, too.

955
00:51:33,563 --> 00:51:35,764
Then I spent the next 12 years

956
00:51:35,766 --> 00:51:38,468
hating myself over and over again.

957
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:39,869
Most people, when they get burned,

958
00:51:39,871 --> 00:51:41,238
they don't touch the stove again,

959
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:43,407
so what the hell's the matter with me

960
00:51:43,409 --> 00:51:45,111
that I can't stop touching it?

961
00:51:48,314 --> 00:51:50,888
You don't know how many times
I've asked myself,

962
00:51:50,890 --> 00:51:52,917
"Why... can't you just be
more like Bill?"

963
00:51:54,550 --> 00:51:57,391
And then...
the other night...

964
00:51:59,823 --> 00:52:01,630
at the hotel,

965
00:52:01,632 --> 00:52:04,565
I-I realized that I've been
punishing myself for no reason,

966
00:52:04,567 --> 00:52:06,700
that... you and me...
we're the same.

967
00:52:06,702 --> 00:52:10,865
Two men trying our best.
How about that?

968
00:52:10,867 --> 00:52:12,496
I'm no better or worse
than Bill Masters.

969
00:52:12,498 --> 00:52:13,495
I thought Virginia explained

970
00:52:13,497 --> 00:52:14,797
we're starting up the study again.

971
00:52:14,799 --> 00:52:17,030
Come on, Bill.
Look who you're talking to here.

972
00:52:17,032 --> 00:52:19,070
I don't know what you mean by that.

973
00:52:19,072 --> 00:52:22,374
Just don't do it the way that I did.

974
00:52:22,376 --> 00:52:24,840
You have got to keep this thing
under wraps.

975
00:52:24,842 --> 00:52:27,145
I mean, I am not
the only one who knows.

976
00:52:27,147 --> 00:52:31,124
Lillian DePaul has been wise
to it from the beginning.

977
00:52:31,126 --> 00:52:34,556
Take it from me...
This bachelor life...

978
00:52:34,558 --> 00:52:35,724
is not all it's cracked up to be.

979
00:52:35,726 --> 00:52:38,658
And don't get me wrong.

980
00:52:38,660 --> 00:52:40,828
There are some days when
it feels like, literally,

981
00:52:40,830 --> 00:52:44,634
I've died and gone
to heaven... literally.

982
00:52:44,636 --> 00:52:46,737
But I can't walk by the nursery anymore

983
00:52:46,739 --> 00:52:50,399
because when I do see
those little bundles...

984
00:52:54,141 --> 00:52:56,542
all I can think is how much
I want to see my kids.

985
00:52:58,650 --> 00:53:03,983
All I'm saying is whatever
this is you have with Virginia,

986
00:53:03,985 --> 00:53:09,319
you... you've got to weigh it
against all of this.

987
00:53:12,931 --> 00:53:14,825
Is it worth it?

988
00:53:45,395 --> 00:53:48,133
Tatti Greathouse just called.

989
00:53:48,135 --> 00:53:52,970
She told me the most outlandish story.

990
00:53:52,972 --> 00:53:55,202
She said that you were fired.

991
00:53:55,204 --> 00:53:58,043
That you assaulted her husband.

992
00:53:58,045 --> 00:54:01,708
I-I-I did lose my temper,
Libby, but you would have, too.

993
00:54:01,710 --> 00:54:03,380
The man is an utter philistine.

994
00:54:03,382 --> 00:54:05,548
Why do I have to hear everything

995
00:54:05,550 --> 00:54:07,086
about my husband third hand?!

996
00:54:07,088 --> 00:54:10,225
I was gonna tell you last night,
but then Austin was here.

997
00:54:10,227 --> 00:54:12,227
This is the second job
in two months, Bill!

998
00:54:12,229 --> 00:54:16,363
Soon there won't be a hospital
left for you to storm out of!

999
00:54:16,365 --> 00:54:17,434
Lib.

1000
00:54:17,436 --> 00:54:19,504
Why are you doing this to me?!

1001
00:54:19,506 --> 00:54:23,610
Is this our life now... you
going from one job to another,

1002
00:54:23,612 --> 00:54:26,350
always finding some reason
why it's not good enough?!

1003
00:54:26,352 --> 00:54:28,247
It's not about "good enough," Libby.

1004
00:54:28,249 --> 00:54:29,318
It's about...

1005
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:30,349
Your study?

1006
00:54:30,351 --> 00:54:32,790
They didn't understand your study?!

1007
00:54:32,792 --> 00:54:36,558
Well, they didn't understand it
at Maternity, either!

1008
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:38,694
That doesn't mean
that things won't work out.

1009
00:54:38,696 --> 00:54:39,863
They will.
Everything will be fine.

1010
00:54:39,865 --> 00:54:40,961
When, Bill?

1011
00:54:40,963 --> 00:54:44,569
When, exactly, will everything be fine?

1012
00:54:44,571 --> 00:54:47,366
How many more opportunities
do you have to squander

1013
00:54:47,368 --> 00:54:48,870
before you make this work?!

1014
00:54:48,872 --> 00:54:54,945
You... you have a wife
and a child who depend on you!

1015
00:54:54,947 --> 00:54:57,249
Doesn't that mean anything?

1016
00:54:57,251 --> 00:55:01,520
Y-yes.
Yes, of c... of course.

1017
00:55:01,522 --> 00:55:04,983
That's all I think about...

1018
00:55:04,985 --> 00:55:11,728
How to do right by you, the baby.

1019
00:55:14,764 --> 00:55:19,236
You j... you just have to trust
me right now, okay?

1020
00:55:19,238 --> 00:55:21,407
I'm gonna take care of you.

1021
00:55:21,409 --> 00:55:24,312
Whatever happens, I will always
take care of you.

1022
00:55:24,314 --> 00:55:26,519
You just have to believe that.

1023
00:55:26,521 --> 00:55:29,152
Please, Libby.

1024
00:55:29,154 --> 00:55:31,520
I ju... I just... I just...

1025
00:55:31,522 --> 00:55:32,919
I nee... I need...

1026
00:55:32,921 --> 00:55:34,881
All right, all right,
all right, all right.

1027
00:55:37,424 --> 00:55:38,695
You'll find the right job.

1028
00:55:38,697 --> 00:55:42,266
And we'll be okay.

1029
00:55:42,268 --> 00:55:44,370
Everything will be okay.

1030
00:55:56,649 --> 00:55:59,520
What's 6 plus 4 equal?

1031
00:55:59,522 --> 00:56:02,616
10.

1032
00:56:02,618 --> 00:56:04,289
What's 6 plus 12?

1033
00:56:04,291 --> 00:56:05,490
Tessa.

1034
00:56:05,492 --> 00:56:07,131
Your brother can't do
your homework for you.

1035
00:56:07,133 --> 00:56:08,660
He does it better, though.

1036
00:56:08,662 --> 00:56:10,499
And what happens when he isn't there?

1037
00:56:10,501 --> 00:56:12,603
Hmm? When the teacher
calls on you in class,

1038
00:56:12,605 --> 00:56:13,932
what are you going to do then?

1039
00:56:15,544 --> 00:56:18,509
You can't count on anybody else
to do your work for you.

1040
00:56:18,511 --> 00:56:20,172
You can only count on yourself.

1041
00:56:20,174 --> 00:56:22,875
Everything that is worth doing
you have to do on your own.

1042
00:56:22,877 --> 00:56:25,315
Did you do everything on your own?

1043
00:56:26,684 --> 00:56:28,548
No, I didn't.

1044
00:56:28,550 --> 00:56:30,019
But I do now.

1045
00:56:30,021 --> 00:56:32,188
From now on.

1046
00:56:55,415 --> 00:56:57,845
We are so very pleased

1047
00:56:57,847 --> 00:57:01,051
that you've decided to join us,
Dr. Masters.

1048
00:57:01,053 --> 00:57:04,115
The pleasure is all mine.

1049
00:57:04,117 --> 00:57:07,324
And I feel comfortable
in speaking for my partner

1050
00:57:07,326 --> 00:57:09,695
when I say how pleased we both are

1051
00:57:09,697 --> 00:57:13,970
to be bringing our work here together.

1052
