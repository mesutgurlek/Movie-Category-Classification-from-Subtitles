a job that gives me experience?

168
00:06:00,681 --> 00:06:00,750
&nbsp

169
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:03,218
If we gave you a job
just to give you experience,

170
00:06:03,218 --> 00:06:03,286
&nbsp

171
00:06:03,286 --> 00:06:06,221
you'd take that experience
and get a better job.

172
00:06:06,221 --> 00:06:06,289
&nbsp

173
00:06:06,289 --> 00:06:08,280
Then that experience
would benefit someone else.

174
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:08,358
&nbsp

175
00:06:08,358 --> 00:06:11,293
But I was trained in college
to handle a job like this.

176
00:06:11,293 --> 00:06:11,361
&nbsp

177
00:06:11,361 --> 00:06:14,489
So in a sense,
I already have experience.

178
00:06:14,489 --> 00:06:14,564
&nbsp

179
00:06:14,564 --> 00:06:16,498
What you've got is
college experience,

180
00:06:16,498 --> 00:06:16,566
&nbsp

181
00:06:16,566 --> 00:06:20,195
not the practical, hard-nosed business
experience we're looking for.

182
00:06:20,195 --> 00:06:20,270
&nbsp

183
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:23,467
If you'd joined our training program out
of high school, you'd be qualified now.

184
00:06:23,467 --> 00:06:23,540
&nbsp

185
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:28,000
- Then why'd I go to college?
- Had fun, didn't you?

186
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,813
&nbsp

187
00:06:30,813 --> 00:06:32,872
What impresses me most...

188
00:06:32,872 --> 00:06:32,949
&nbsp

189
00:06:32,949 --> 00:06:36,350
is the amount of experience you picked
up while still attending college.

190
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:36,419
&nbsp

191
00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:39,582
Well, ma'am, I knew all
those years of college...

192
00:06:39,582 --> 00:06:39,656
&nbsp

193
00:06:39,656 --> 00:06:43,558
would be worthless without practical,
hard-nosed business experience.

194
00:06:43,558 --> 00:06:43,626
&nbsp

195

You're not gonna tell me I have
too much experience, are ya?

Certainly not, you're
perfect for the job.

207

No. No exceptions.

I want this job.
I need it. I can do it.

&nbsp

Everywhere I've been today
there's always been something wrong.

Whatever the exception is,
I can fix it.

&nbsp

219
00:07:16,092 --> 00:07:18,720
I can be older. I can be taller.
I can be anything.

&nbsp

223
00:07:23,433 --> 00:07:27,130
- Mom, I'm doin' great.

&nbsp

229

I got a fantastic office,
got a gorgeous secretary. The works.

00:07:37,436 --> 00:07:37,513
&nbsp

231
00:07:37,513 --> 00:07:40,914
- We don't care if she's gorgeous.
Is she any good?
- What?

232
00:07:40,914 --> 00:07:40,984
&nbsp

There is no danger.

263
00:08:26,329 --> 00:08:28,593

&nbsp

265

&nbsp
