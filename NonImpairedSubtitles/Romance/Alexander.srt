1
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,500
Our world has gone now.

2
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:12,200
Smashed by the wars.

3
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:16,700
Now I am the keeper of his body, 

4
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:20,600
bound here in the egyptian ways,

5
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:25,600
I followed him as pharaoh, and now ruled 40 years.

6
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,500
I am the victor, but what does it all mean.

7
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,900
When there is no one left to remember,

8
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:37,900
The great cavalry charge of (...) or the mountains of the hindu kush,

9
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:44,500
When we crossed the 100,000 man army into India.

10
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,100
He was a God (...) 

11
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,900
or as close as anything i've ever seen.

12
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,900
Tyrant they yelled so easily, i laugh.

13
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:04,500
No tyrant ever gave back so much.

14
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:09,500
And what do they know of the world,these school boys, 

15
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,200
it takes strong man to rule.

16
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:16,100
Alexander was more,he was permitheous, a friend to man,

17
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:19,100
He changed the world, 

18
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:24,100
before him, there were tribes, and after him,

19
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,100
Always possible, 

20
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:32,100
There was sudden near sense the world, could be ruled by one king, be better for all.

21
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:40,800
18 Great Alexandrias he built, it was an empire not of land and gold, 

22
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,800
but of the mind, lennox civilization, 

23
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:51,400
oakland, tour,

24
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:58,900
How can i say it? How can I tell you what it is like to be young?

25
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,600
To dream, big dreams, 

26
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:06,000
to believe when Alexander looked you in the eye,

27
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
You could do anything, anything.

28
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:16,500
In his presence, by the light of Apollo, we were better than ourselves.

29
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,800
Truly, i've known many great men in my life, 

30
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:28,700
but only one colossus,

31
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:31,000
And only now in old 

32
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
do i understand who this force of nature really was.

33
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,100
Or do I? 

34
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:46,400
Did such a man as Alexander exist?

35
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:51,400
Of course not, they idolize him, make him better than he was.

36
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:56,500
Men, all men reach in full, 

37
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:01,900
reach in full.

38
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:09,900
The east, the fast persian empire, ruled almost all the known world.

39
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,800
The west, once great greek city states, 

40
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:20,800
thieves, athens, sparta, had fallen from pride.

41
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:26,900
For a hundred years now, the persian kings had bribed the greeks with their gold,

42
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,000
To fight as mercenaries, 

43
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
it was Philip, the one eyed, that changed all this.

44
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:40,000
United tribes of illiterate sheep herders, from the high and low lands,

45
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,400
With his blood and guts, he built a professional army,

46
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:49,300
Brought the devious greeks to their knees.

47
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:52,400
He then turned his eye on persia, 

48
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,100
where to as said the new great king to arise himself,

49
00:06:56,100 --> 00:07:01,100
on his thrown in babylon, feared Philip.

50
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:09,900
It was from these loins of war, that Alexander was born, in Pella.

51
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:21,500
Pella Macedonia

52
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:26,200
Some called his mother queen Olympius, or sorcerous, 

53
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,900
and said that Alexander was the child of Dienisious,

54
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:34,700
others Zeus, 

55
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:39,700
but truly there was not a man in Macedonia who didn't look at father and son,

56
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:45,200
side by side, and wonder.

57
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:57,100
&Trust the ones who give you love&

58
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:04,400
&life has just begun son.&

59
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:10,700
Her skin is water, her tongue is fire.

60
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:18,100
She's your friend

61
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:23,200
Take it, 

62
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:27,200
If you hesitate she will strike,

63
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:32,200
Remember that, never hesitate.

64
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:44,600
Yes, they are like people, you can love them for years, 

65
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:50,700
feed them, nurture them, but still,

66
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:57,700
they can turn on you.

67
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:15,800
Come...

68
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:23,400
(...) babarian, Philip makes a mockery of Dienisious every night.

69
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:54,600
Women, are the only ones that know Dienisious.

70
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:33,600
My little achilles.

71
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:56,800
Stay Alexander down.

72
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,000
What is it you..

73
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
6 months to this day.

74
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,500
No no, not here.

75
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,700
Drop it to your king,

76
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:09,700
King of what, sheepherders men.

77
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,700
*laughing*

78
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:15,900
I, am of achilles royal blood.

79
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,600
Well achilles runs in my veins.

80
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,700
Your are nothing but a drunkin whore.

81
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:24,700
(...) curse the very name of you.

82
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:31,700
You think people respect you, you think they dont know your bastards?

83
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,300
Damn your sorcereous soul, keep him here like one of your snakes,

84
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:47,900
I told you not, i told you not!

85
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,400
It'll be me.

86
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,600
I will not.

87
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:55,600
You will be me or I'll kill you, with my own hands.

88
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:01,700
Stop stop stop

89
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:09,000
Your majesty no, 

90
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,200
in the name of god.

91
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,900
He will never be yours, NEVER! 

92
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:20,900
in my womb i carried my avengin.

93
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,500
8 years later

94
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:35,500
In the world he grew up to, I have come to believe it wasn't friendship,

95
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:41,100
that Alexander found his hamity.

96
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:46,100
Fight, (...) of a battle, taste, 

97
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:51,400
know the barbarian drive, courage wont be in the lining of your stomach,

98
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:57,200
It's in the heart of a man, 

99
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,500
We dont need to eat everyday or until your full, 

100
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:06,500
we dont need to lie in bed in the morning when you can have some good bean soup to sander,

101
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:12,200
Of your force night (...) come on Alexander, come on,

102
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:17,100
Whatever expects you as a king, just because of your father, 

103
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:21,700
the first rule of war is to do what you ask your men to do, 

104
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:26,700
no more no less.

105
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:32,800
That's it, well done my student, good wrestling, that's what i want,

106
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:37,000
come come come...You did well but you lost, 

107
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,000
now both of you will congratulate the other, good.

108
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:47,500
Would you want me to let you win Alexander?

109
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:52,500
Your right, but I promise you I will beat you one day Hephaistion.

110
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:00,200
It was said later that Alexander was never defeated 

111
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:04,700
except by Hephaistion's thighs.

112
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:07,500
Although an inferior race, 

113
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:12,500
the persians control at least 4/5's of the known world,

114
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:17,600
But is it possible, the source of Egypt's mighty river nile, 

115
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:22,000
could rise in these distance mountains of the outer earth?

116
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,000
If so, an experience navigator could find his way, 

117
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,300
here, by this river east,

118
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:33,000
down into the great plains of india, 

119
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Out into the eastern ocean, and into the world,

120
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,000
and by this route, up the nile, back to egypt, 

121
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:48,500
into the middle sea, and home, to Greece.

122
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:53,700
Now if only these frogs could look outward and act on their favorite position of the center,

123
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:57,200
Greece could rule the world.

124
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:02,200
Why is it master, in myth these lands you speak of are known,

125
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:09,400
India, where hericlees, and dienisious traveled.

126
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:14,400
All these men who went east, thesious, Jason, Achilles, were victorious.

127
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:20,100
From generation to generation there stories have been past on, why?

128
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,800
Unless there was truth to them.

129
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,100
Tales or amazons? 

130
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:28,100
no Alexander, only common people believe these tales.

131
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,900
As they believe most anything.

132
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:34,900
We are here precisly to educate ourselves against such foolish passions.

133
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,200
But if we are superior to the persians as you say, 

134
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,000
why do we not rule them?

135
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:46,000
It is, it has always been our greek dream to go east.

136
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:52,300
The east has a way of swallowing men and their dreams.

137
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,900
Master, master...

138
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:57,500
Yes?

139
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:57,800
Master?

140
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,900
Out with it, out with it.

141
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:02,200
Why are the persians so cool? 

142
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,000
That is not the subject for today neokus, 

143
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,000
but it is true, the oriental races are known for their barbarity, 

144
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,900
and their slavish devotion to their senses, 

145
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:16,300
Excess in all things, is the undoing of men, 

146
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:18,300
that is why we Greeks are superior,

147
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:23,300
We practice control of our senses, moderation, we hope.

148
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:28,200
And what of Achilles at Troy master? Was he not excessive?

149
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:33,200
Achilles simply lacks restraint he dominates other men so completely,

150
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,200
that even when he withdraws from battle crazed with grief,

151
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:41,400
over his dead lover procutules, he seriously endangers his own army,

152
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,900
He is a deeply selfish man.

153
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:48,900
Then would you say that the local (...) Achilles and Procutules is a corrupting one?

154
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:53,300
When men lie together in lust, it is a surrender to the passions,

155
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:56,700
and does nothing for the excellence in us, 

156
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:01,700
nor does any other, excess kasander, jealousy among them, 

157
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:07,400
but when men lie together and knowledge and virtue are pass between them, 

158
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:11,200
that is pure, and excellent, 

159
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:14,000
when they compete to bring out the good,

160
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,600
the best in each other, this is the love between men,

161
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:22,600
that can build the city state and lift us from our frog bottom.

162
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:32,000
Philip brought (...) Aristotle from Athens to educate our rough people,

163
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,000
and growing more ambitious he now planned the invasion of persia.

164
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:46,100
Is that the best you can do (...) back to the falinx with you,

165
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,000
I'll ride him myself. 

166
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:52,000
No one can ride that beast your majesty.

167
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:56,100
He's been breeding far too often.

168
00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:00,400
My noble king, he's a high spirit, (...)

169
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:05,400
and worthy of philip of macedonia(...)

170
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:12,600
Why would i want such a beast, i already have a wife.

171
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:17,800
Do I seem so old?

172
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:42,700
Broken neck comes free (...) he's too nervous for battle.

173
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:47,700
Buy him for me father, I'll ride him.

174
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,200
And if you dont?

175
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,600
I'll pay for him myself.

176
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,900
With what, your singing voice?

177
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,700
I'll pay you.

178
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:02,700
I tell you the horse can't be riden lad, he's mind is broken.

179
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:07,500
He can be riden, by me.

180
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:12,500
If you can rule that horse i'll make him yours, at half the price.

181
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,900
That horse will kill him Philip, will break the boy in two.

182
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:20,900
Really? perhaps you'll make a musician out of him yet.

183
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:33,700
The boy does not have the craft Philip, he could hurt himself.

184
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:38,700
He will have to figure that out for himself, it's time.

185
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,100
You do not like your shadow do ya? 

186
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:51,300
It is like a dark spirt coming up sketchy,

187
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:56,100
See that's us, 

188
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:59,300
It's just a trick of Apollos, 

189
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:04,300
he's the god of, Sun.

190
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:12,200
But i will show you how to out win him, you and me together.

191
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:39,400
Osephilis, that is what i will call you, strong and stubborn,

192
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:47,900
Osephilis and Alexander, 

193
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:52,900
come now, let us ride together.

194
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,200
Ahhhh, he's got some tight in em yet, 

195
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:31,200
(name), (name) for Zeus's sake, he beat ya man.

196
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Now Osephilles, show them.

197
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:17,200
My son, my son!

198
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,700
You remember Achilles?

199
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,000
He is my favorite?

200
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,800
Why?

201
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:36,500
Because he loved Procutules and avenged his death.

202
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,400
And his fate?

203
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,000
That he must die young, but with great glory.

204
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,700
Did he have a choice?

205
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:48,400
Oh yes, live a long life but there would be no glory.

206
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,700
Dream of glory Alexander, your mother encourages you,

207
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:57,700
There is no glory with out suffering, and this you will not allow.

208
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:04,500
One day I will be on walls like these.

209
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:09,500
Permitheous stole the secret of fire and gave it to man,

210
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:13,000
Made Zeus so angry, 

211
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,200
chained permitheous to a rock in the great carcasses,

212
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:21,000
and each day, his eagle pecked out the poor man's liver,

213
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,700
each night it grew back again, so that it could be eaten the next day, 

214
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:30,700
miserable fate.

215
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:34,100
Why?

216
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:39,100
Who knows these things, anyway, 

217
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:46,100
edipus, tore out his eyes,

218
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:51,100
He found out, murdered his father, married his mother, 

219
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:55,100
knowledge that came too late,

220
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:59,400
The Deer, slaughtered her two children in vengence,

221
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:04,400
And Jason left her for a younger wife.

222
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:16,300
My mother would never hurt me.

223
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:19,700
Never easy to escape our mothers Alexander,

224
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:24,700
All your life be ware of women, by far more dangerous than men.

225
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:36,000
Ariclees, even after he accomplished his 12 labors,

226
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:41,000
He was punished for madness, slaughtered his 3 children

227
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Poor Ariclees,great Ariclees, 

228
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:50,600
all great must come from loss,

229
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:55,600
Even you, the gods will one day judge partially.

230
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,800
When I'm king like you one day father.

231
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:03,800
Do not rush the day boy, you risk all, 

232
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:08,200
my father threw me into battle before i knew how to fight,

233
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:13,200
When i killed my first man he said "now you know" 

234
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,400
i hated him then,

235
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:20,400
But I understand why now, a king isn't born Alexander,

236
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:25,600
He is made by stealing, by suffering,

237
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:30,600
A king must know how to hurt those he loves.

238
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:37,100
It is lonely, ask Ariclees, 

239
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:41,800
ask any of them fate is cruel,

240
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:46,800
No man or woman could be too powerful or too beautiful, without disaster be falling, 

241
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,800
they laugh when you rise too high,

242
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:54,600
Crush everything you built with the wind,

243
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:59,400
The glory they give, in the ending they take away,

244
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:04,400
They make of us slaves.

245
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:29,300
8 years later

246
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:33,600
Pregnant so soon, the little whore,

247
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:38,000
You will marry her in the spring, during the (...) festival,

248
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,900
And when her first son is born, her sweet uncle atilus,

249
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:46,500
Will convince philix to name the boy, his successor,

250
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:49,000
With himself in regions.

251
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,200
And you, 

252
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:55,300
you will be sent on some impossible mission,

253
00:26:55,300 --> 00:27:00,000
Against some monstrous northern tribe, to be mutilated,

254
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,800
In one more meaningless battle over cattle,

255
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:08,800
And I no longer queen, will be put to death with your sister,

256
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,300
And the remaining members of our family.

257
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:17,000
I wish, sometimes you could see the light mother,

258
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:22,000
The truth is he has taken nothing from you that you have not been without.

259
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:28,000
The only way is to strike, announce your marriage to a macedonian,

260
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,600
Now with get the child of pure blood, 

261
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,700
he would be one of them not mine,

262
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:37,100
And he would have no choice but to make you king, 

263
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:41,200
there is still king henni.

264
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:45,400
(...) perfect, if your father that pig had not ravaged her.

265
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:50,400
Say nothing more of my father, do you hear me say nothing.

266
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:56,900
Your right, forgive me, 

267
00:27:56,900 --> 00:28:01,900
a mother loves too much.

268
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:11,200
Who shall I sing to at night anymore?

269
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:18,900
I wish, I wish we could spend more time together, 

270
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:24,700
like we used to, when you were the sweetest boy.

271
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:32,200
There's never been time mother, 

272
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:37,200
since I was a child, i have been groomed to be ever the best.

273
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:42,500
Aaw my poor child, like Achilles, 

274
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:47,500
cursed by your greatness.

275
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:55,400
Take my strength.

276
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:02,600
You must never confuse your feelings with your duties Alexander.

277
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:10,300
A king must make public gestures for the common people.

278
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:13,800
I know, but you will be 19 this summer, 

279
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:16,000
and the girls already say you dont like them,

280
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,700
You like Hephaistion more, 

281
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:22,400
I understand it is natural for a young man,

282
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:27,000
But if you go to Asia with out leaving your successor you risk all.

283
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,300
Hephaistion loves me, 

284
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:35,300
as I am, not who.

285
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:40,900
Loves? Loves? 

286
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:45,400
In the name of dienisious, 

287
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:50,400
understand how philix thinks for your own sake,

288
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,900
Your life hangs in the balance, 

289
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:58,900
he's spies are inside your closest...

290
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:02,900
Stop! 

291
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:07,900
I am his only worthy son, you crazed woman, 

292
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:12,000
he would never hurt me,

293
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Even if (name) had a boy, he would be 20 before he would let him rule.

294
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:20,400
Yes, and you would be 40, 

295
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:25,400
old and wise, like potterman and philix young son would be 20,

296
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:31,700
Like you now, but raised by him, 

297
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:36,700
his blood, he will never give you the thrown now alexander, 

298
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:43,000
never.

299
00:30:55,900 --> 00:31:00,400
Ahhh, come Alexander drink this (...) 

300
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:05,400
as only thirst can quench sorrow.

301
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,900
There is only one thing better than winning a battle son,

302
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:14,100
And that's the taste of a new woman 

303
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:19,000
you will find it far sweeter than (...)

304
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Alexander, Alexander found you the right girl?

305
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,700
What's your name? 

306
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:26,700
I'm chikini.

307
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:27,400
Huh, what's your name?

308
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:31,000
Chikini.

309
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,400
I love you my limp.

310
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:39,400
And I love you clopis.

311
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,900
Would you prefer a seat cleitis?

312
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:47,900
*lot of drunken talk*

313
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:01,400
A toast, a toast! 

314
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:06,400
I drink to our great friends and to our new union,

315
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:11,900
Macedonia and Greece equals in greatness, 

316
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:18,400
to Philip our king, 

317
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:21,900
without home this union could not be possible.

318
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:26,500
Come (name) Leave some damn air in the hole?

319
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:29,800
And last I drink to the king's marriage 

320
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:34,800
to my niece (name) a macedonian queen we can be proud of.

321
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:43,800
To Philip and (name) and to their legitamate sons.

322
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:54,800
You son of a dog, come then.

323
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:13,600
This is my wedding not some public brawl, 

324
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:18,000
apologize by Zeus before you dishoner me.

325
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,800
He's afraid the man who called my mother a whore and me a bastard, and i dishoner you?

326
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:27,200
You listen like your mother, Atlas is my family now the same as you.

327
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,900
Then choose your relatives more carefully, 

328
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:32,400
don't expect me to sit here and watch you shame yourself.

329
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,600
Shame?

330
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,700
He insults me!

331
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:39,400
I insult you? Am i not fit to ground my mother walks on? 

332
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,600
You dog, questioning your queen.

333
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:46,600
Shame? I have nothing to be ashamed of you arrogant brat, 

334
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:49,100
i'll marry the girl if i want,

335
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:54,100
And i'll have as many sons as I want and there's nothing you or your harpy mother could do about it.

336
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:58,100
Why drunken man must you think everything I do and say comes from my mother?

337
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:01,200
Because I know her heart by Hera.

338
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:06,200
And I see her in your eyes, you come with this thrown too much, 

339
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:12,300
now we all know that she will for the mother of yours, wants me dead, 

340
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,200
well you can both dream boy.

341
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:19,000
Come Philip, this is the wine talking, leave the boy, wait til morning.

342
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:24,000
No, I command you, 

343
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:29,500
apologize to your kinsmen.

344
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,400
Apologize!

345
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:42,400
NO kinsmen to me.

346
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:48,500
Goodnight old man, and when my mother re-marries, 

347
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:52,000
i'll invite you to her wedding.

348
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:57,000
You bastard.

349
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:04,300
You will obey me, come here.

350
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:24,500
And this is the man who is going to take you from Greece to Persia? 

351
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:27,300
He can't even make it from one couch to the next.

352
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:31,800
Get out of my palace, your exiled you bastard, 

353
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:36,100
banished from the land, your not welcomed here, 

354
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:41,100
You're no son of mine.

355
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:50,100
Everything, suddenly changed for him, 

356
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:54,800
His father King Philip was murdered, 

357
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:57,800
and Alexander 20 

358
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:02,800
became the new ruler of macedonia.

359
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:08,100
And breaking their treaties with us, dismissing alexander as an untried boy,

360
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:10,400
Several Greek city states, 

361
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:15,400
rose up in revolk much to persia's delight,

362
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:20,700
And have sponsored by their gold.

363
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:26,000
And truly Alexander could love like no other, 

364
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,900
but to betray him was to rouse a vast and frightening anger, 

365
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:35,000
(...) several thousand of the men of their tragic city thieves 

366
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,900
and sold the survivors into slavery. 

367
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:42,900
This has intended stund and defeated the greeks, 

368
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:47,900
and though in the end they treated most populations with magnimity 

369
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:49,900
it is these exceptions, 

370
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:54,900
thieves (...) persia and others,

371
00:36:55,800 --> 00:37:00,800
That are always remembered by those who hate Alexander and all that he stood for.

372
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,400
At 21, Alexander invaded Asia 

373
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:08,700
with an army of 40,000 trained men.

374
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:12,200
And liberating one city state after the other, 

375
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:16,100
he conquered all of western asia, south to egypt, 

376
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:20,300
where he was declared Pharoah of egypt, 

377
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:24,000
worshiped as a god.

378
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:29,000
It was in Egypt that the respected oracle siwah 

379
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:35,500
declared him the (...).

380
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:41,800
He finally provoked (name) himself to battle 

381
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:46,800
in the heart of the persian empire near babylon.

382
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:51,900
Gaugamela, Persia

383
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:56,900
It was mad, 40,000 of us against 250,000 barbarians.

384
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:05,500
It was the day Alexander had waited for all his life.

385
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:14,100
Alexander son of a god, 

386
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:19,100
it was a myth of course, at least it started as a myth, 

387
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:24,400
I know, i was there, i saw his eyes.

388
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:30,700
There at the crack of the persian line, we'll go for the head.

389
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:33,900
Kill their eyes?

390
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:37,900
The gods have brought him to us at last, 

391
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:40,200
If i die, it's one macedonian, 

392
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:44,300
but the persians they can not move with out authorized his command. 

393
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:49,000
Here, right here we cut the croak of the persian army.

394
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,600
This is madness, you will never get withing 100 paces of him.

395
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:55,300
Have you seen the sheer size of his force Alexander?

396
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:59,200
Not IF you hold him on the left, my brave parmanion, 

397
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:04,200
with your son (name), for just 1, 2 hours tomorrow.

398
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:09,700
And you unbreakable antagonist the center falinx (name, name, name, name) 

399
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,400
if you pin them on the walls of (name) here in the center, 

400
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,800
their cavalry will follow me out to the right, 

401
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:28,400
and when bold cassander breaks,

402
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,500
stretching their left, a hole will open, 

403
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:35,900
Then I and my cavalry, a revered cleitis, 

404
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:40,900
(name) and (name) will strike through that gap, 

405
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:45,100
and deal the death blow to the (...)head.

406
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:49,000
Alexander even with luck, timing, the gods, we must route them tomorrow, 

407
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,700
destory their army completely,

408
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:54,800
Or we be picked apart by bandit tribes on a long journey home.

409
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,900
Right.

410
00:39:56,900 --> 00:40:01,600
You speak of home and retreat, 

411
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:05,700
but do you understand how many on, 

412
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:10,400
babylon is my new home.

413
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:14,600
Alexander if we must fight, 

414
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:17,300
do so with stealth, use your numbers well, 

415
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:22,300
we should attack tonight when they least expect us.

416
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:26,900
I didn't cross asia to steal this victory cassander.

417
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:30,200
No, you are too honorable for that, 

418
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:35,200
no dad influence from sleeping with tales of troy under your pillow. 

419
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:40,100
But your father was no lover of homeless.

420
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:44,500
The lands west of the (...) the hand of his daughter in marriage, 

421
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:46,900
since when has a greek ever been given such honors?

422
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:50,900
This are not honors, are many of the bribes, 

423
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:55,000
the greeks have accepted too long,

424
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,900
Do you forget that the man who murdered my father lies across the valley floor.

425
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:03,900
Come Alexander, we are still not really sure if it was persian gold behind the assassination.

426
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:13,200
Your father taught you never to surrender your reason, to your passion, 

427
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:16,300
now I urge you to regroup,

428
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:19,500
Fall back to the coast, raise a larger force.

429
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:24,300
I would if I were permanian, 

430
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:26,800
but I am Alexander, 

431
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:31,300
and no more than earth has 2 sons will asia bear two kings, 

432
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:36,300
these are my terms, and if arias isn't a coward who hides behind his men, 

433
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:41,900
then he will come to me tomorrow,

434
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:46,900
And when he bows down to Greece, 

435
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:52,100
Alexander will be merciful.

436
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:07,800
(...)and lads feast tonight, for tomorrow we will die in hades.

437
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:24,200
To whom do you pray?

438
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:29,000
Phobos.

439
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Fear (...).

440
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:42,700
Or so for dorius. 

441
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:51,100
I have come to believe that fear of death drives all men Ephistian,

442
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:54,800
This we didn't learn at school board, 

443
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:58,900
it is the cause of all (...) fortunes.

444
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:00,600
So, mighty (name)

445
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:04,200
Your majesty.

446
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:05,500
Are you ready for tomorrow's dawn?

447
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:10,500
Ah, it's been too long coming if you ask me, I mean (...)

448
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:15,300
Good, fear makes men fight better.

449
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:17,600
Post your centurions alert keep them rested well.

450
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:21,900
Don't you worry General, i have been known to sleep with my eyes open as a baby's ass.

451
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:26,900
Only cause someone might steal his loot sire.

452
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:30,000
After tomorrow even the thrifty among you will shall be kings.

453
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,600
God be with us your majesty.

454
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:35,900
Will stay in the ground, with the persian blood of the king.

455
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:38,400
I alwasy believed Alexander 

456
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:42,300
but this seems so much bigger than us.

457
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:47,300
Did (petropolis) die before Achilles when they stood side by side at seed of Troy?

458
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:50,400
Petropolis died first.

459
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:55,400
If you do, if you were to fall Ephistian macedonia would lose a king, 

460
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:02,500
i will avenge you and follow you down to the house of death.

461
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:08,400
I would do the same.

462
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:20,600
On the eve of battle it is hardest to be alone.

463
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:28,100
Then perhaps, 

464
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:32,000
perhaps this is farewell then, 

465
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,800
my Alexander.

466
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:38,600
Fear not Ephistian, 

467
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:43,600
we are at the beginning.

468
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:19,900
Blood makes the world crazed, 

469
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:24,900
blood makes the rain fall, 

470
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:31,100
blood makes the earth grow.

471
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:32,700
In blood 

472
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:37,700
all man are born and died.

473
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:44,300
Blood is the food of the gods below.

474
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:04,200
Help me Osiphilis , today we ride to our destiny.

475
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:12,500
(name) I remember you the day you took the seed tower at tire, 

476
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:18,300
you were a giant, and today how will you fight?

477
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:28,700
(name) how far was it you threw your men resting at the last olympic games?

478
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:33,900
Will you match it with your spear?

479
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:41,200
And Tamander son of men under, a great soldier to my father, 

480
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,800
i still mourn your brother odius,

481
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:46,600
Who died so bravely at helicarnusus, 

482
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:50,300
what an honor of family you descend from tamander, 

483
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:54,900
You fight for them today.

484
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:59,900
You have all honored your country and your ancestors,

485
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:06,000
And now we come to this most distant place in asia,

486
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,300
Where across from us 

487
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:13,300
(name) has gathered a vast army...

488
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:43,600
But ask yourselves, Who is this great king, 

489
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:48,600
who pays assassins in gold coins to murder my father, 

490
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:53,700
our king, in a most dispicable, and cowardly manner, 

491
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:00,000
and who is this great king dorius who enslaves his own men to fight? 

492
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:05,100
Who is this king, but a king of air?

493
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:08,300
These men do not fight for their homes.

494
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:13,300
They fight because this king tells them they must.

495
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:28,700
We are here today, as Macedonian free men.

496
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:49,400
Some of you, perhaps myself,

497
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:55,500
Will not live to see the sun set over these mountains today,

498
00:49:56,100 --> 00:50:01,100
But I say to you, what every warrior has known since the beginning of time,

499
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:07,400
Conquer your fear, and I promise you will conquer death.

500
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:39,000
You will answer, i was here this day at Gagilaya, 

501
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:44,100
for the freedom 

502
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:49,100
and glory 

503
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:54,200
of Greece.

504
00:50:58,300 --> 00:51:03,300
ZUES be WITH US!!

505
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Where does he go?

506
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Don't know majesty.

507
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:47,000
(...)

508
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:26,000
He makes a mistake (name).

509
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:32,300
Yes there king.

510
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:36,400
Be brave men.

511
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:39,300
Macedonian Left

512
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:44,300
(leader giving instructions)

513
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:29,700
Prepare to repult centurions.

514
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:58,800
Alexander!! Go...

515
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:27,400
(...) We must fall back to the gally. (...)

516
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:57,600
Come (name) ride, ride!!!

517
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:14,300
Break through the hole!

518
00:58:57,900 --> 00:59:02,900
*instructions* 

519
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:09,000
Go tell Alexander yourself, 

520
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:14,000
and if he wont listen then survive me, and avenge his betrayal.

521
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:36,500
Pay attention lad, your father still watches over you!

522
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:20,900
Dorius!!! 

523
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:25,900
Ride your horses!

524
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:44,200
Dorius!!!!

525
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:22,400
We can reach those (...) by sunset,

526
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:24,800
Go (...) catch their eyes by dawn.

527
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:28,300
Releases the horses.

528
01:01:28,300 --> 01:01:32,200
Alexander, Alexander my father is lost, 

529
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:35,300
they have overrun us (...) their into the baggage train.

530
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:36,700
(name) is crumbling.

531
01:01:36,700 --> 01:01:37,600
Ah!!!!

532
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:42,400
Alexander if you chase them, you risk losing your army here.

533
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:47,400
And if we capture him we gain an empire.

534
01:01:54,700 --> 01:01:57,500
You can run to the ends of the earth you coward,

535
01:01:57,500 --> 01:02:01,200
But you will never run far enough.

536
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:06,200
(...)

537
01:02:23,900 --> 01:02:26,600
You bleed free my lord, May i tend to your wound?

538
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:29,000
No, atlas not now, 

539
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:34,000
it's far worse than me, go to them, help them.

540
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:02,200
Your majesty,

541
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:07,200
Your very brave, what should i call you?

542
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:08,400
Gloucus my king.

543
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:12,600
Gloucus and where is your home?

544
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:16,100
Elyria.

545
01:03:16,100 --> 01:03:20,100
Let your body go lose, 

546
01:03:20,100 --> 01:03:25,100
think about (...) be brave again Gloucus 

547
01:03:26,100 --> 01:03:29,200
and you will live on in glory.

548
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:34,200
Alexander.

549
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:46,600
Persian empire, the greatest the world had yet known was destroyed.

550
01:03:55,800 --> 01:04:00,800
And Alexander at 25 was now King of all.

551
01:04:13,300 --> 01:04:18,300
Alexander once said to me, we are most alone when we are with the myths.

552
01:04:23,900 --> 01:04:28,900
Babylon, Persia

553
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:33,300
And thus it came to pass in a dream as mythical to all greeks 

554
01:04:33,300 --> 01:04:36,000
as Achilles defeating the trojans,

555
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:39,400
That there is one glorious moment in time, 

556
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:44,400
Alexander was loved by all.

557
01:04:45,900 --> 01:04:49,700
But in the end i believed babylon was a far easier (...) to enter 

558
01:04:49,700 --> 01:04:54,700
than she was to leave.

559
01:06:15,500 --> 01:06:18,900
Imagine the minds that can see this, 

560
01:06:18,900 --> 01:06:20,200
with architects and engineers like these,

561
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:23,100
We can build cities such as we only dreamed.

562
01:06:23,100 --> 01:06:28,100
Aristotle may have called them barbarians but he never saw babylon.

563
01:06:28,100 --> 01:06:33,100
We have enough gold here to support another 3 generations of macedonian armies.

564
01:06:33,900 --> 01:06:37,000
Macedonia will soon corrupt cassander, 

565
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:42,000
wealth in great quantities brings the crows.

566
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:46,300
Not for the men who fought i trust?

567
01:06:46,300 --> 01:06:48,600
We will pay them well (name). 

568
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:50,600
But not as mercenaries for future services.

569
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:53,300
You sound like Philip.

570
01:06:53,300 --> 01:06:54,900
Philip never saw babylon.

571
01:06:54,900 --> 01:06:59,900
Look, he didnt advise him.

572
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:05,600
Alexander, i know you think me a stiff old sog, 

573
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:08,200
but whatever our differences, know this day,

574
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:13,200
Your father would be very proud of you.

575
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:16,200
Thank you (name), 

576
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:20,700
And i ask you to forgive me, my own anger my pride,

577
01:07:20,700 --> 01:07:25,700
They too blind me.

578
01:07:27,900 --> 01:07:31,300
Yes, the grandsons of goat herders 

579
01:07:31,300 --> 01:07:34,700
we now rule 2 million square miles.

580
01:07:34,700 --> 01:07:36,600
Not like we are giving it all away.

581
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:41,600
But, none of you fear that this straight fortune 

582
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:45,200
may drive us all to destruction.

583
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:50,200
You over value us, for As long as Dorius breathes he is the legitamite king of asia,

584
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:53,200
And I but the king of air.

585
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:56,300
But he has no power alexander, 

586
01:07:56,300 --> 01:07:58,300
he is lost in the mountains wit no (...)

587
01:07:58,300 --> 01:08:01,800
As long as he is lost (name) he can be believed in. 

588
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:06,800
Only when he is found will be decided.

589
01:08:06,900 --> 01:08:09,300
Seems you already made up your mind Alexander.

590
01:08:09,300 --> 01:08:12,100
We must finish what we failed to do at (...) Parmenium 

591
01:08:12,100 --> 01:08:14,400
we must hunt dorius if it be to the ends of earth.

592
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:16,000
That was not your father's mission.

593
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:20,600
And I am not my father.

594
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:25,600
Come on, have you so quickly forgotten, fortune favors the bold.

595
01:08:29,100 --> 01:08:30,400
By the gods what is this?

596
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:33,600
No wonder Dorius fled, he had this to come back to.

597
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:38,600
I venture one for every night of the year.  

598
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:08,100
Help me aphroditi, how will i ever go back to (name) after this?

599
01:09:08,100 --> 01:09:13,100
I advise you not to touch (...) here i'll take care of it for you.

600
01:09:54,900 --> 01:09:58,700
Aristotle was perhaps present, 

601
01:09:58,700 --> 01:10:03,700
with these images foolish with their beauty and degrade our souls. 

602
01:10:20,500 --> 01:10:25,500
Great king Alexander.

603
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:31,500
The princess of 1000 troses. and ellis daughter of the formerly great king Dorius.

604
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:35,800
(name presented)

605
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:40,800
Noble Alexander.

606
01:10:44,500 --> 01:10:49,500
I come to beg for the lives of my sisters, 

607
01:10:50,700 --> 01:10:55,700
my mother, my grandmother.

608
01:10:58,100 --> 01:11:02,600
You are not wrong princess (name), 

609
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:07,600
he too is alexander.

610
01:11:08,500 --> 01:11:13,500
Please, I plead for my families lives, 

611
01:11:15,500 --> 01:11:17,600
sell me as a slave great king.

612
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:22,200
Look now, into my eyes, 

613
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:25,300
princess, 

614
01:11:25,300 --> 01:11:30,300
and tell me how would you like to be treated?

615
01:11:32,300 --> 01:11:37,300
As I am, a princess.

616
01:11:39,900 --> 01:11:44,900
Then so be it, you and your family shall be treated as my family,

617
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:52,700
You shall live in this palace as long as you choose,

618
01:11:52,700 --> 01:11:57,700
Have you any other request? for me my noble princess?

619
01:11:58,900 --> 01:12:03,900
No, everything I wish, 

620
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:08,500
I have...

621
01:12:08,500 --> 01:12:14,400
Requested.

622
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:19,400
You truly are a queen.

623
01:12:25,100 --> 01:12:30,100
Yes, she would be a perfect match for you but you do nothing.

624
01:12:30,100 --> 01:12:34,000
3 months you have been in babylon, and leave me and (name)

625
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:37,900
At the mercy of your enemies, of which you have many,

626
01:12:37,900 --> 01:12:41,600
And (name) accustom now to the part you have given him,

627
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:46,600
I must watch him grow stronger.

628
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:53,000
I am certain that he communicates secretly with Parmenian,

629
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:58,000
Who is dangerous, but beware most of all of those closest to you,

630
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:02,300
They are like snakes and can be turned.

631
01:13:02,300 --> 01:13:06,500
General (name)

632
01:13:06,500 --> 01:13:10,500
Cassander is and tibiders son, 

633
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:14,400
even cleitis your fathers favorite,

634
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:17,200
Anton your friend yes, 

635
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:22,200
but beware of men who think too much, they blind themselves.

636
01:13:25,500 --> 01:13:29,000
Only Ephistian do i leave out, 

637
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:34,000
but all of them you may preach while your mother and yourself, 

638
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:38,500
You live in generous poverty, 

639
01:13:38,500 --> 01:13:41,800
why wont you ever believe me?

640
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:46,800
It is only a dark mind like mine that can know these secrets of the heart,

641
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:50,700
For they are dark Alexander, 

642
01:13:50,700 --> 01:13:55,100
so dark but in you, 

643
01:13:55,100 --> 01:14:00,000
the son of Zeus lies the light of the world,

644
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:04,200
Your companions will be shadows in the underworld,

645
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:07,500
And you are a name living forever in history,

646
01:14:07,500 --> 01:14:10,400
As the most glorious shining light of youth,

647
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:13,300
Forever young, forever inspiring, 

648
01:14:13,300 --> 01:14:17,100
Never will there be an Alexander like you,

649
01:14:17,100 --> 01:14:20,800
Alexander the Great.

650
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:24,500
Remember bring me to babylon as you promised,

651
01:14:24,500 --> 01:14:27,900
I can only help you for they know if they harm you,

652
01:14:27,900 --> 01:14:32,900
They will face my wrath, as queen of babylon.

653
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:37,400
That is a high ransom she charges for 9 months lodging in the womb.

654
01:14:37,400 --> 01:14:42,400
Bring her Alexander, It will give her such joy.

655
01:14:43,500 --> 01:14:48,500
And on the cracked mirror of her dreams.

656
01:14:49,400 --> 01:14:54,400
Stay with me tonight Ephistian.

657
01:14:58,700 --> 01:15:03,700
I will take my own bath, thank you (name).

658
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:23,800
The generals question your obsession with arias, 

659
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:27,300
They say it was never meant for you to be king of Asia.

660
01:15:27,300 --> 01:15:31,400
Naturally, they want only to return to their homes rich with gold.

661
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:36,400
But I've seen the future Ephistian, i've seen it 1000 times, 1000 faces,

662
01:15:36,900 --> 01:15:41,900
These people want, need change.

663
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:45,800
Aristotle was wrong about them.

664
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:47,500
How so?

665
01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:52,100
Look at those we have conquered, They leave their dead unburied,

666
01:15:52,100 --> 01:15:57,100
They smash their enemies skulls and drink from it's dust, they mate in public,

667
01:15:57,500 --> 01:16:02,400
What can they think, or sing or write, when none can read,

668
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:07,300
But as Alexander's army they can go, where they never thought possible,

669
01:16:07,300 --> 01:16:10,500
They can soldier work in the cities, 

670
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:15,300
the alexandrias egypt to the (...) ocean,

671
01:16:15,300 --> 01:16:19,500
We can connect these lands of (...) and the people,

672
01:16:19,500 --> 01:16:24,500
Some say these alexandrias are becoming extensions of alexander himself,

673
01:16:26,300 --> 01:16:29,500
They draw people into the cities so as to make slaves.

674
01:16:29,500 --> 01:16:34,500
But we freed them Ephistian from the persia where everyone lived as slaves,

675
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:39,000
To free the people of the world, 

676
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,400
such would be beyond the glory of archilles,

677
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:46,400
Beyond hericules, feet will rival pernithius, 

678
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:50,100
was always a friend to man.

679
01:16:50,100 --> 01:16:54,800
Remember the fates of these hereos, they suffered greatly.

680
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:59,800
No we all suffer, your father, mine,

681
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:03,800
They all came to the end of their time,

682
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:08,800
And in the end when its over all that matters is what you have done.

683
01:17:09,300 --> 01:17:14,300
You once said the fear of death drives all men,

684
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:17,400
Are there no other forces?

685
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:21,800
Is there not love in your life?

686
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:26,800
Alexander?

687
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:35,600
I wonder sometimes, if it is not your mother you run from,

688
01:17:37,100 --> 01:17:42,100
So many years, so many miles between you,

689
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:46,500
What is it you fear?

690
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:50,000
Who knows these things,

691
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:55,000
When I was a child my mother taught me to find my father weak,

692
01:17:57,700 --> 01:18:00,500
Which am I Ephistian?

693
01:18:00,500 --> 01:18:05,400
Weak or Divine?

694
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:10,400
All I know is I trust only you in this world,

695
01:18:10,700 --> 01:18:15,700
I missed you, I need you,

696
01:18:16,700 --> 01:18:21,700
It is you I love Ephistian, no other.

697
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:31,200
You still hold your head cocked,

698
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:33,000
Like that,

699
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:34,300
I have stopped that.

700
01:18:34,300 --> 01:18:35,600
No like a deer listening in the wind,

701
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:40,300
You strike me still Alexander,

702
01:18:40,300 --> 01:18:43,900
You have eyes like no other,

703
01:18:43,900 --> 01:18:48,900
Ugh I sounded stupid as school boy,

704
01:18:51,500 --> 01:18:54,400
Your everything I care for,

705
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:58,600
And by the sweet breathe of aphroditi,

706
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:01,900
I am so jealous of losing you to this world. You want so badly.

707
01:19:01,900 --> 01:19:05,200
You will never lose me Ephistian,

708
01:19:05,200 --> 01:19:08,900
I will be with you always, 

709
01:19:08,900 --> 01:19:13,900
until the end.

710
01:19:17,400 --> 01:19:22,400
Northeastern Persia

711
01:19:24,700 --> 01:19:27,100
The campaign in the northeastern persia 

712
01:19:27,100 --> 01:19:32,100
turned into a hard gorilla war of almost 3 years.

713
01:19:35,100 --> 01:19:40,100
We chased Dorius toward (place) but missed taking him by hours.

714
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,300
He was dying when we found him sire,

715
01:19:46,300 --> 01:19:51,300
He asked for water, he drank and died. 

716
01:19:57,600 --> 01:20:02,600
The great king Dorius had been betrayed by his own commanders.

717
01:20:30,300 --> 01:20:32,400
Fully honoring his corpse,

718
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:37,400
Alexander hunted down these commanders to unknown lands.

719
01:20:38,300 --> 01:20:43,300
Crossing even beyond the river oxes, into (place).

720
01:20:47,300 --> 01:20:52,300
We fought them as far as the unknown steps of (place),

721
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:55,900
For only legend we hereos who once taught,

722
01:20:55,900 --> 01:21:00,900
The surveyors told us we were now in the borders of where Europe and asia meet,

723
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:06,200
In fact we were totally lost,

724
01:21:06,200 --> 01:21:09,300
Here alexander founded his 10th alexandria, 

725
01:21:09,300 --> 01:21:14,300
and settled it with veterans then women and any who would dare the frontier life, 

726
01:21:15,700 --> 01:21:18,600
Unable to accept defeat in any form,

727
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:23,500
Alexander persissted in breaking every tribe that resisted,

728
01:21:23,500 --> 01:21:28,500
Until the day he received the head of his last enemy in surrender.

729
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:37,400
For alexander there could be no pretender to the thrown of asia,

730
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:43,000
Which now (...)

731
01:21:44,500 --> 01:21:49,500
It was here that alexander made one of his most mysterious decisions.
