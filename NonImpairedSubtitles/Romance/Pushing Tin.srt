Continental 901,
eight miles from marker...

00:02:55,136 --> 00:02:59,038
...maintain 2000 till
intercepting the localizer.

3
00:03:01,376 --> 00:03:04,504
TWA 732, runway 04.
Newark altimeter is 2992.

4
00:03:04,713 --> 00:03:08,149
Continental 525,
turn left heading 140.

5
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:10,375
Maintain 5000, 220 knots.

6
00:03:22,097 --> 00:03:25,328
- Please let that mean you're finished.
- Yes.

7
00:03:26,234 --> 00:03:28,225
We're here all week.

8
00:03:28,436 --> 00:03:32,930
- Contact Boston Center now.
- Ed, Tower wants them out faster.

9
00:03:33,174 --> 00:03:36,575
I've only got so much room.
Airspace is finite.

10
00:03:36,778 --> 00:03:39,440
- Ed's going down the pipes.
- I am not.

11
00:03:39,681 --> 00:03:43,242
You are. It happens when
you use the word "finite."

12
00:03:43,718 --> 00:03:47,381
American 427, heading 210.
Traffic 5:00 above you.

13
00:03:47,589 --> 00:03:52,026
- Correction, below you. No, no!
- Blow you? Blow me, correct.

14
00:03:52,594 --> 00:03:57,622
- Nick, could you take Allegheny 2629?
- Sure, I got room for the whole fleet.

15
00:03:57,866 --> 00:04:00,767
You don't have to take it.
You're full.

16
00:04:00,969 --> 00:04:03,301
- Teamwork.
- Don't be a pain, Pat.

17
00:04:03,538 --> 00:04:05,369
- Off the rubber!
- Get off!

18
00:04:05,573 --> 00:04:09,907
Allegheny 2629 reduce speed
to 180 knots. Altimeter 2992.

19
00:04:10,111 --> 00:04:12,705
One-eighty, 2629.

20
00:04:12,981 --> 00:04:17,975
KLM 3729, three miles southeast bound.
I put him ahead of you. Caution...

21
00:04:18,219 --> 00:04:20,744
...turbulence.
- He's in sight, 3729.

22
00:04:21,289 --> 00:04:25,419
Thanks. Turn 20 degrees left.
I'll keep you on the ILS.

23
00:04:26,561 --> 00:04:30,463
"4 out of 5 dentists surveyed
recommend sugarless gum."

24
00:04:30,732 --> 00:04:34,099
Sugarless gum, sugarless gum,
sugarless...

25
00:04:34,302 --> 00:04:38,796
...gum, gum, gum, income, become...
Continental 962, head 140.

26
00:04:39,074 --> 00:04:40,632
140, Continental 962.

27
00:04:40,842 --> 00:04:43,970
American 7736, contact
Newark tower, 118.3.

28
00:04:44,179 --> 00:04:47,637
- Thanks.
- You do good work. American 7736.

29
00:04:47,849 --> 00:04:51,580
- I need more planes to stay interested.
- I'll be damned.

30
00:04:51,786 --> 00:04:55,984
- Continental 428, descend to 5000.
- 6 to 5. Continental 428.

31
00:04:56,257 --> 00:05:00,353
- Continental 961, go to Robbinsville.
- To Robbinsville.

32
00:05:00,595 --> 00:05:02,358
He shoots. He scores.

33
00:05:03,932 --> 00:05:09,097
It's sleek, it's crisp.
Is that crisp vectoring or what?

34
00:05:09,637 --> 00:05:12,504
I got them lined up like Rockettes.

35
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:34,117
- You think Tina looks good lately?
- Too muscular.

36
00:05:34,329 --> 00:05:38,163
- We see her every day.
- It'd be like sex with your wife.

37
00:05:43,872 --> 00:05:46,841
- Extra-crispy makes me ill.
- I'll take them.

38
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:50,807
- I want a side of berries.
- White toast for me.

39
00:05:51,012 --> 00:05:54,641
- Whatever toast you got.
- No butter, wheat toast.

40
00:05:54,849 --> 00:05:58,080
- I gotta start again.
- Not to worry there, Kim.

41
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:02,585
Everybody loses the picture sometimes.
Take the weight off.

42
00:06:02,857 --> 00:06:06,884
Don't worry, he bails us out too.
She was gonna sit here.

43
00:06:07,896 --> 00:06:10,888
Two eggs easy, crisp bacon,
browns, wheat.

44
00:06:11,099 --> 00:06:13,897
A 3-egg ham and cheddar,
no onion, rye.

45
00:06:14,102 --> 00:06:16,593
A 3-egg sunny, tall buttermilk...

46
00:06:16,871 --> 00:06:20,170
...pigs, browns, double white
and side berries.

47
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:25,506
Move it! Strive for greatness.
I'm a restaurant critic for The Times.

48
00:06:32,854 --> 00:06:36,688
Pardon me. Would you join us
until something opens up?

49
00:06:36,925 --> 00:06:40,361
- We'll wait.
- My mother'd be ashamed of me sitting.

50
00:06:40,562 --> 00:06:43,793
She'll have a heart attack if I tell her.

51
00:06:44,032 --> 00:06:46,557
I think it would be okay.

52
00:06:46,901 --> 00:06:48,528
- How you doing?
- Good.

53
00:06:48,736 --> 00:06:52,604
- Come on, now. Part the Red Sea.
- Have a seat.

54
00:06:52,807 --> 00:06:56,243
- Thank you.
- Barry, Ron, Ed, I'm Nick. You are?

55
00:06:57,278 --> 00:06:59,644
- Karen.
- Nice to meet you.

56
00:06:59,914 --> 00:07:02,405
- I'm Beverly.
- Hi, how are you?

57
00:07:02,617 --> 00:07:04,642
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

58
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:06,216
I'm married.

59
00:07:06,821 --> 00:07:10,780
- You were about to attack him, huh?
- Do you work together?

60
00:07:10,992 --> 00:07:12,926
We're in aviation.

61
00:07:13,127 --> 00:07:14,924
- Pilots?
- How can you tell?

62
00:07:15,129 --> 00:07:16,562
I drive a plane.

63
00:07:18,299 --> 00:07:22,133
What are they doing?
What are they doing? Karen?

64
00:07:24,606 --> 00:07:26,073
You're safe.

65
00:07:26,307 --> 00:07:31,108
- We're air traffic controllers.
- So you work in a tower somewhere?

66
00:07:31,312 --> 00:07:34,577
No, we work in a big building
on the island.

67
00:07:34,782 --> 00:07:36,306
- A TRACON.
- A what?

68
00:07:36,517 --> 00:07:38,917
Terminal Radar Approach Control.

69
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,181
- It's not near an airport.
- We funnel planes through New York.

70
00:07:43,424 --> 00:07:46,621
- Tower turns you over to us.
- 7000 a day.

71
00:07:46,861 --> 00:07:50,319
More planes closer together
than any other place.

72
00:07:50,531 --> 00:07:52,761
- It's true.
- It sounds tough.

73
00:07:53,001 --> 00:07:56,459
- It is.
- I don't know what the big deal is.

74
00:07:56,671 --> 00:08:01,301
Seems to me like you just sit around
talking on the radio.

75
00:08:01,643 --> 00:08:05,511
- It's much more complicated than that.
- It's complicated.

76
00:08:05,713 --> 00:08:11,049
- This job can be a bit stressful...
- Stop saying it's stressful!

77
00:09:13,781 --> 00:09:16,011
- Hey, baby.
- Hey, honey.

78
00:09:16,384 --> 00:09:19,080
- You hungry?
- No, we ate at Ted's.

79
00:09:19,287 --> 00:09:22,256
- Lipstick.
- Where are you going?

80
00:09:22,457 --> 00:09:25,722
School, to talk about
Nicky's attention span.

81
00:09:25,927 --> 00:09:29,693
- What about it?
- Apparently he doesn't have one.

82
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:33,266
How do I look?

83
00:09:33,534 --> 00:09:36,367
Do I look parental and concerned?

84
00:09:37,105 --> 00:09:39,903
You look great. Maybe I should go too.

85
00:09:40,108 --> 00:09:42,975
That's okay. I can handle this.

86
00:09:44,379 --> 00:09:48,475
- I want you to stay, get some sleep.
- Sleep is boring.

87
00:09:48,716 --> 00:09:50,581
I worry about you.

88
00:09:50,785 --> 00:09:54,084
- Do you have to go right away?
- Why?

89
00:09:56,391 --> 00:09:58,621
Oh, that feels good.

90
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,755
Will you at least hurry back?

91
00:10:04,332 --> 00:10:07,130
- From what?
- The attention thing.

92
00:10:07,835 --> 00:10:11,271
Save it, honey.
There's a casserole in the...

93
00:10:12,106 --> 00:10:14,904
- In the fridge.
- Fridge.

94
00:10:30,658 --> 00:10:33,821
- Be fast.
- It'll be like it never happened.

95
00:10:34,028 --> 00:10:38,692
We need one of those chairs,
the things that the old people have.

96
00:10:39,033 --> 00:10:41,797
Yes, I'll be right there. I'm...

97
00:10:42,003 --> 00:10:44,699
I'm sorry, Sister Beatrice.

98
00:10:44,939 --> 00:10:47,237
Yes, I understand. I'm sorry.

99
00:10:47,442 --> 00:10:50,536
Yes, I'm very sorry. Yeah, bye-bye.

100
00:10:51,479 --> 00:10:56,883
I hate conferences like this. I always
feel like a failure as a parent.

101
00:10:57,118 --> 00:11:00,645
She's a nun.
They're very unhappy people.

102
00:11:00,855 --> 00:11:05,349
- I'll help with his homework.
- Only when you work days.

103
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:09,018
- He'll be a third smarter.
- You work days 12 times.

104
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:13,564
- It's not a third.
- Like what? 12 into 31. It's like...

105
00:11:13,801 --> 00:11:18,067
- I've got my art class tonight.
- What are you talking about?

106
00:11:18,539 --> 00:11:23,841
The adult extension class,
Drawing the Human Form. I told you.

107
00:11:24,045 --> 00:11:25,410
You know, I just...

108
00:11:25,713 --> 00:11:28,307
...I need to feel a little more...

109
00:11:28,649 --> 00:11:31,641
I need to have a life of the mind.

110
00:11:33,254 --> 00:11:36,519
- Will there be lots of bare-assed guys?
- No.

111
00:11:36,724 --> 00:11:40,023
- They come later.
- That's why you're doing it.

112
00:11:40,228 --> 00:11:42,492
Do you think it's a bad idea?

113
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:45,824
No, I think all that stuff is good.

114
00:11:47,068 --> 00:11:49,832
Whatever makes you happy, you know?

115
00:11:51,739 --> 00:11:54,367
You're happy, aren't you, Connie?

116
00:11:54,575 --> 00:11:57,100
Yeah. Sure.

117
00:11:59,347 --> 00:12:02,077
What a funny old question.

118
00:12:30,978 --> 00:12:35,244
This is the radar to show us
all the planes over New York.

119
00:12:35,449 --> 00:12:39,715
Kennedy, La Guardia and Newark
are all within 20 miles.

120
00:12:39,921 --> 00:12:42,116
7000 flights take off every...

121
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:45,223
- What are you doing?
- Let it go.

122
00:12:45,459 --> 00:12:47,450
Okay, guys. Right up here.

123
00:12:47,662 --> 00:12:53,123
- Cute kids, Pat. They all yours?
- In the past, I laid my share of pipe.

124
00:12:53,601 --> 00:12:58,732
- Each of these blips is an airplane.
- Mind stepping off the rubber?

125
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:01,966
Did you know that an
air traffic controller...

126
00:13:02,176 --> 00:13:05,509
...is responsible for more lives in a shift...

127
00:13:05,746 --> 00:13:08,078
...than a surgeon is in his life?

128
00:13:08,282 --> 00:13:11,809
- It looks like a computer game.
- This is no game.

129
00:13:12,019 --> 00:13:15,648
You make a mistake here,
there's no reset button.

130
00:13:15,856 --> 00:13:16,982
Don't touch me.

131
00:13:17,191 --> 00:13:21,025
I hear controllers have
the highest rates of depression...

132
00:13:21,262 --> 00:13:24,891
...nervous breakdowns,
heart attacks and alcoholism.

133
00:13:25,099 --> 00:13:29,900
- Don't forget suicide, kid.
- He always researches our field trips.

134
00:13:30,104 --> 00:13:32,732
- He's been online since he was 4.
- Pat.

135
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:35,465
- What?
- Take them somewhere else.

136
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:38,042
Okay, this way. Here we go.

137
00:13:38,245 --> 00:13:42,944
Controlling air traffic's
much like conducting an orchestra.

138
00:13:43,217 --> 00:13:47,119
Mr. Feeney used a metaphor.
Can you say "metaphor"?

139
00:13:47,321 --> 00:13:52,588
That wasn't a metaphor. That was
a simile. "Laying pipe" is a metaphor.

140
00:13:59,567 --> 00:14:02,434
I got a departure, he didn't tag up.

141
00:14:02,637 --> 00:14:05,128
- What did you give last?
- 28 and 8.

142
00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:08,399
- Climbing to 8? I don't see him.
- There!

143
00:14:08,643 --> 00:14:09,803
Turn him left!

144
00:14:10,011 --> 00:14:12,479
- I don't see his prime!
- Turn him.

145
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,807
- Turn him!
- I'm not seeing him!

146
00:14:15,016 --> 00:14:17,109
- I don't see him.
- Right there.

147
00:14:17,318 --> 00:14:21,516
- He's got no data block.
- Is there gonna be a crash?

148
00:14:21,756 --> 00:14:24,987
- Get these kids out of here.
- Come on, kids.

149
00:14:27,261 --> 00:14:30,321
Econojet 2166, traffic at 2:00.
You see him?

150
00:14:30,531 --> 00:14:31,862
That's a negative.

151
00:14:32,099 --> 00:14:35,466
Correction. I see him!
He's headed right at me!

152
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:38,867
2166, immediate left turn heading 070.
Expedite!

153
00:14:39,106 --> 00:14:40,630
Lmmediate. Roger.

154
00:14:44,512 --> 00:14:47,777
- They're in pieces.
- No, please.

155
00:14:58,793 --> 00:15:02,058
Econojet 2166. Left turn expedited.

156
00:15:02,296 --> 00:15:06,960
- I told you to turn him!
- Go, Ronnie. Go, Ronnie.

157
00:15:07,168 --> 00:15:09,033
- Knock it off!
- Big guy.

158
00:15:10,304 --> 00:15:14,570
- Nick, plug in.
- Why are you upset? Nobody got killed.

159
00:15:14,809 --> 00:15:18,108
- Wasn't a squawk. Not my fault.
- It's okay.

160
00:15:18,312 --> 00:15:21,213
- There's a Jetlink...
- I got the picture.

161
00:15:22,316 --> 00:15:23,908
There was no squawk.

162
00:15:24,151 --> 00:15:27,746
We're waiting for you in hell.
How about a wet one?

163
00:15:27,988 --> 00:15:29,751
- Kiss it.
- There was no ident.

164
00:15:30,024 --> 00:15:31,924
- Oh, no.
- It wasn't my fault.

165
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:34,559
Get back to your scope.

166
00:15:37,598 --> 00:15:39,691
You're done. You're through.

167
00:15:39,934 --> 00:15:43,495
Econojet 2166,
reduce speed to 170 knots.

168
00:16:26,313 --> 00:16:28,804
Jerk! Can we use the street too?!

169
00:16:29,049 --> 00:16:31,984
It looks like I wet my pants. Fuck.

170
00:16:51,672 --> 00:16:54,004
That's what I'm talking about.

171
00:17:00,915 --> 00:17:03,406
Continental 1250, turn left 130.

172
00:17:03,617 --> 00:17:06,745
Continental's lined up.
Jetlink's in fourth.

173
00:17:06,954 --> 00:17:10,754
This looks like a parrot cage.
You're almost molting.

174
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:12,118
See you.

175
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:14,691
- Come on!
- Sorry.

176
00:17:15,596 --> 00:17:20,465
Jetlink 3596, reduce speed
to 190 knots. Fly heading 090.

177
00:17:20,668 --> 00:17:25,469
- Lots of dinks for a weekday.
- Let's fly up close to them big jets.

178
00:17:25,673 --> 00:17:31,111
- Sparta 753 for Newark approach.
- Hey, Sparta 753. Is this Jethro?

179
00:17:32,146 --> 00:17:35,604
- How's my favorite redneck?
- You mocking me, son?

180
00:17:35,816 --> 00:17:40,150
Before you run out of cornpone
or whatever you use for fuel.

181
00:17:40,354 --> 00:17:43,687
We wouldn't waste
good moonshine to fly.

182
00:17:43,891 --> 00:17:47,224
Am I supposed to
find New York by the smell?

183
00:17:47,461 --> 00:17:51,989
Sparta 753, turn left heading 070.
Maintain 2000 till localizer.

184
00:17:52,199 --> 00:17:55,464
- Cleared ILS runway four.
- ILS runway four.

185
00:17:55,669 --> 00:17:59,969
Let's get dinner. I wanna see
if you're as ugly as you sound.

186
00:18:00,207 --> 00:18:03,335
I'll find a place
where we don't need shoes.

187
00:18:03,544 --> 00:18:06,638
Is your pig there
or are you sleeping alone?

188
00:18:06,881 --> 00:18:10,317
Can I have your attention?
Turn off your scopes.

189
00:18:10,517 --> 00:18:13,680
This is the new man.
This is Russell Bell.

190
00:18:13,921 --> 00:18:17,379
Russell's worked Albuquerque,
Denver, Phoenix.

191
00:18:17,591 --> 00:18:19,650
He's wanted in three states.

192
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:24,058
This motley group does the impossible:
Make me look good.

193
00:18:24,265 --> 00:18:29,202
Setting up a tailgate for the Giants game.
Meadowlands. Who's in?

194
00:18:29,403 --> 00:18:31,564
Who's up for it, huh? It's...

195
00:18:32,006 --> 00:18:33,667
You're all business.

196
00:18:33,874 --> 00:18:37,833
Okay, let's get
Russell checked out ASAP.

197
00:18:40,247 --> 00:18:44,911
Welcome aboard, Bell.
Get you started on your paperwork.

198
00:18:48,022 --> 00:18:51,287
- What's that?
- Who cares, if he makes the cut.

199
00:18:51,525 --> 00:18:55,586
That is one man closer to my getting
a quiet job upstate...

200
00:18:55,796 --> 00:18:58,094
...seeing a shrink with big tits.

201
00:18:58,299 --> 00:19:02,861
At least we know when he's here,
he won't be robbing our homes.

202
00:19:04,271 --> 00:19:08,264
I don't know.
I think he looks kind of interesting.

203
00:19:09,076 --> 00:19:12,477
You'd like to bring him down
your main runway?

204
00:19:12,713 --> 00:19:13,771
Go die.

205
00:19:13,981 --> 00:19:15,972
Like a wholegrain muffin?

206
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:19,447
- That kind of interesting?
- Hanging left today?

207
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:24,757
Jetlink 2946, your company traffic's
at 3:00. Slow down to 180.

208
00:19:24,959 --> 00:19:26,654
I am at 180.

209
00:19:26,927 --> 00:19:28,895
Correction, 160.

210
00:19:33,667 --> 00:19:36,966
I heard of this guy.
I got a buddy in Denver...

211
00:19:37,171 --> 00:19:41,107
...who mentioned a weird guy
who was the best controller.

212
00:19:41,308 --> 00:19:45,074
In the sticks.
Till you hit five, living is easy.

213
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:48,077
If it's him, I also heard he's crazy.

214
00:19:48,315 --> 00:19:52,149
He stood on a runway
and let a 747 fly over his head.

215
00:19:52,353 --> 00:19:53,342
What for?

216
00:19:53,587 --> 00:19:56,852
To understand what
wake turbulence felt like.

217
00:19:58,092 --> 00:20:00,151
- That's bullshit.
- That's bogus.

218
00:20:00,361 --> 00:20:04,263
We allow five miles between planes
for wake turbulence.

219
00:20:04,465 --> 00:20:05,898
That's what I heard.

220
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:10,264
- It would've killed him.
- You've seen him. Sure it didn't?

221
00:20:11,972 --> 00:20:13,530
Hey, Russell.

222
00:20:15,275 --> 00:20:18,767
You've met Ron Hewitt,
our very own Emily Post.

223
00:20:18,979 --> 00:20:20,810
Let's go, smiley.

224
00:20:25,886 --> 00:20:30,220
Nick Falzone. I'm called "The Zone."
Shake it like you mean it.

225
00:20:34,228 --> 00:20:38,187
So we're going out
after work for a few drinks...

226
00:20:38,399 --> 00:20:40,993
...a few laughs. You wanna join us?

227
00:20:48,942 --> 00:20:50,466
You don't say much.

228
00:21:03,457 --> 00:21:06,949
- Trudy, hit us up.
- Bring us seven shots, will you?

229
00:21:07,161 --> 00:21:10,597
Russell, word is you're a good controller.

230
00:21:10,798 --> 00:21:13,733
What's the most planes
you had to handle?

231
00:21:13,934 --> 00:21:19,304
- I didn't have time to count. Why?
- Our washout rate's a mere 50% .

232
00:21:19,506 --> 00:21:23,306
We wonder if the new guy
will go wacko when cornered.

233
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:25,910
And you will get cornered here.

234
00:21:26,747 --> 00:21:28,908
Don't unpack.

235
00:21:29,149 --> 00:21:32,641
I just move them around
so they don't collide.

236
00:21:32,853 --> 00:21:35,845
I felt that way, but they're human beings.

237
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:39,025
- Kind of dampens it.
- Nobody told me that.

238
00:21:39,259 --> 00:21:42,160
One more round, then I'm cutting you off.

239
00:21:42,362 --> 00:21:45,854
They test you,
you're blowing it without my help.

240
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:49,331
We heard you stood on a runway
in New Mexico...

241
00:21:49,536 --> 00:21:53,131
...and let a 747 part your hair
with wake turbulence.

242
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:55,331
- That happen?
- No.

243
00:21:55,709 --> 00:21:59,338
- That's what we thought.
- No, that was in Arizona.

244
00:22:01,048 --> 00:22:03,107
You really did that?

245
00:22:06,653 --> 00:22:11,056
- Why?
- My life was short on excitement.

246
00:22:11,391 --> 00:22:14,554
Of course, all that's changed tonight.

247
00:22:15,362 --> 00:22:18,229
- I'll get the tip.
- No, we'll flip for it.

248
00:22:18,432 --> 00:22:22,368
- Nope. On the quick, you ready?
- Can't we flip?

249
00:22:22,903 --> 00:22:26,999
- Everybody take a match.
- I hate this! Why do we do this?

250
00:22:27,207 --> 00:22:31,166
- Reindeer games.
- Got it? Strike on the count of three.

251
00:22:31,378 --> 00:22:33,846
- Wait, wait, wait.
- I'll count.

252
00:22:34,047 --> 00:22:36,743
One, two, three.

253
00:22:37,384 --> 00:22:42,378
- First one to drop it pays the tip.
- Wait, mine's burning faster.

254
00:22:42,656 --> 00:22:45,784
- Mine's burning faster.
- Another conspiracy.

255
00:22:45,993 --> 00:22:48,461
It's burning faster than yours.

256
00:22:48,695 --> 00:22:51,926
- Shit!
- We'll see if Ron owns a wallet.

257
00:22:52,166 --> 00:22:56,034
I own a wallet. It's not fair.
It's cheap matches.

258
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:58,135
Guys, Ron's paying.

259
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:03,500
Game's over, guys. Come on.

260
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:06,201
You guys, what are you doing?

261
00:23:21,695 --> 00:23:23,162
I guess that's it.

262
00:23:28,035 --> 00:23:30,833
I guess I'd better get out of here.

263
00:23:36,476 --> 00:23:40,003
- Jesus, what was that all about?
- Nothing.

264
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:46,481
Hey, Tommy, Dr. Freeze is back.

265
00:23:47,421 --> 00:23:49,013
Tina, guess what?

266
00:23:49,223 --> 00:23:52,317
- Dr. Freeze has returned.
- I'm coming.

267
00:23:54,895 --> 00:23:59,355
- Ed, Dr. Freeze is back.
- He's working with a new therapist.

268
00:23:59,566 --> 00:24:02,558
Five dollars says
he gets to the scopes.

269
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:06,062
Dr. Freeze is back
to try it one more time.

270
00:24:06,273 --> 00:24:09,174
- Who's Freeze, Tommy?
- Who's Freeze?

271
00:24:09,376 --> 00:24:14,678
He froze up on the scopes so bad,
they took him out in an ice-cream bag.

272
00:24:18,252 --> 00:24:20,584
It's a big sky. Lots of room.

273
00:24:20,787 --> 00:24:24,223
They won't hit. Lots of room.

274
00:24:25,859 --> 00:24:29,693
It's a big sky. Lots of room.

275
00:24:29,896 --> 00:24:32,956
They won't hit. Lots of room.

276
00:24:34,301 --> 00:24:37,566
- There he is!
- Morning, doc!

277
00:24:38,238 --> 00:24:39,899
Good to see you.

278
00:24:46,313 --> 00:24:49,441
All right, doc. Come on down.

279
00:24:50,884 --> 00:24:53,876
Lots of planes waiting out there, doc.

280
00:24:54,488 --> 00:24:58,015
- Come on, doc.
- You can do it. Come on, baby!

281
00:24:58,225 --> 00:24:59,556
Lots of sky.

282
00:24:59,826 --> 00:25:02,294
- Lots of sky.
- Looking good, doc.

283
00:25:02,829 --> 00:25:04,922
- United 2417...
- On approach.

284
00:25:05,232 --> 00:25:07,427
...climb to 4000.

285
00:25:09,403 --> 00:25:11,394
You got it. It's yours.

286
00:25:15,676 --> 00:25:17,837
One, two...

287
00:25:18,745 --> 00:25:20,576
I don't know, sir.

288
00:25:21,114 --> 00:25:23,639
- Lots of sky!
- Goodbye!

289
00:25:25,752 --> 00:25:27,617
Give me the money!

290
00:25:27,854 --> 00:25:31,449
- I had the door.
- You had the doorway.

291
00:25:31,658 --> 00:25:33,387
What's the difference?

292
00:25:33,593 --> 00:25:36,960
- Two inches from the door.
- From there to there...

293
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,725
Not to worry. How's it going?

294
00:25:42,936 --> 00:25:45,268
- I got to the door.
- Way to go!

295
00:25:45,505 --> 00:25:50,374
- That's your best since you went down.
- I got hypnosis to thank.

296
00:25:50,977 --> 00:25:54,344
- Good to see you. Come back soon.
- You too.

297
00:26:40,227 --> 00:26:42,161
You're an hour late.

298
00:26:42,362 --> 00:26:45,889
USAir 2166, turn left heading 120.
Altimeter 2992.

299
00:26:46,099 --> 00:26:49,933
- I'm up to my ass in airplanes...
- Roger. USAir 2166.

300
00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:52,001
Looks frightening, huh?

301
00:26:54,875 --> 00:26:58,936
Continental 2591, contact tower 118.3.
Take care, thanks.

302
00:27:02,416 --> 00:27:05,613
- Brought your chair with you.
- Yeah.

303
00:27:05,852 --> 00:27:10,221
- Is that a good-luck charm?
- I thought you were busy.

304
00:27:10,857 --> 00:27:13,883
Continental 2735,
caution wake turbulence.

305
00:27:14,127 --> 00:27:16,459
Contact tower 118.3. Thanks.

306
00:27:17,197 --> 00:27:19,597
Got you, 2735. Good day.

307
00:27:20,867 --> 00:27:24,735
Okay, chief, slide on in.
Let's get you all saddled up.

308
00:27:31,311 --> 00:27:36,112
- Delta's due for a right turn. Jet...
- I get it. I got the picture.

309
00:27:36,316 --> 00:27:39,808
Delta 532, turn left heading 140,
maintain 4000.

310
00:27:40,053 --> 00:27:43,147
- Was that 140?
- You'll be right up his butt.

311
00:27:43,423 --> 00:27:45,323
Delta 532. Up his butt.

312
00:27:45,559 --> 00:27:49,222
- Jetlink 3601, fly south heading 180.
- Jetlink. 180.

313
00:27:49,429 --> 00:27:54,264
- Eagle 4912, descend to 4000.
- Five to four. 4912.

314
00:27:54,734 --> 00:27:58,226
You got two airplanes
headed towards each other.

315
00:27:58,772 --> 00:28:00,433
- Yes.
- You gonna turn one?

316
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:05,168
- After I put the Jetlink between them.
- You wanna be in the paper?

317
00:28:05,445 --> 00:28:09,905
If I don't, everyone loses the connections.
Delta 532, slow to 160.

318
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:13,017
Continental 2478, slow to 140.

319
00:28:13,353 --> 00:28:17,346
- Jetlink 3594, increase speed to 230.
- Did you say 230?

320
00:28:17,591 --> 00:28:21,584
That's right. I need it now.
Come on. Pedal faster.

321
00:28:22,629 --> 00:28:27,657
- 2478, traffic at your 10:00.
- We've got him in sight. 2478.

322
00:28:27,868 --> 00:28:30,803
532, verify visual contact with 2:00.

323
00:28:31,004 --> 00:28:34,167
That's affirmative.
He's hard to miss now.

324
00:28:42,983 --> 00:28:47,613
- What's the problem?
- He almost put three planes together.

325
00:28:47,821 --> 00:28:49,448
They had visual.

326
00:28:49,723 --> 00:28:52,715
These two planes
are going nose to nose!

327
00:28:53,793 --> 00:28:59,060
Continental 2478, turn right
heading 060, slow to 140.

328
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:03,328
- Delta 532, slow to 160.
- 160.

329
00:29:03,637 --> 00:29:07,038
- Continental 2478, descend to 3000.
- 2478.

330
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:11,370
Delta 532, make a hard left turn
heading 090.

331
00:29:14,314 --> 00:29:16,179
It's too steep a turn.

332
00:29:17,684 --> 00:29:22,053
- I'm gonna kiss my tail.
- Make the turn or I'll spin you.

333
00:29:22,255 --> 00:29:25,986
You'll land nice and easy
sometime before Christmas.

334
00:29:28,261 --> 00:29:31,230
Left heading 090. Delta.

335
00:29:41,675 --> 00:29:45,042
Delta 532. Scary,
but I must say, good job.

336
00:29:45,245 --> 00:29:48,271
- Thank you very much.
- Good job.

337
00:29:48,548 --> 00:29:50,573
Nice talking to you, Bill.

338
00:29:51,117 --> 00:29:53,108
Yeah, you too, Nick.

339
00:29:56,356 --> 00:29:58,790
Nick, come on in.
Come on, boy.

340
00:29:59,059 --> 00:30:02,893
Come on in. Jeez.
Take a seat, pal. Go ahead.

341
00:30:03,096 --> 00:30:08,090
I called the traffic manager
about Russell. He sent me this.

342
00:30:51,277 --> 00:30:55,179
- Watch it again! This is funny stuff.
- Play that again.

343
00:31:08,361 --> 00:31:10,295
Do you believe that?

344
00:31:14,834 --> 00:31:17,803
He's a fucking cowboy. You know that?

345
00:31:18,004 --> 00:31:23,101
It's funny you should say that.
They told me he's part Cree Indian.

346
00:31:23,309 --> 00:31:25,903
He's a half-breed. He doesn't fit.

347
00:31:26,112 --> 00:31:29,513
There's an aluminum shower
in his future.

348
00:31:29,716 --> 00:31:33,015
Passenger safety
is our highest priority.

349
00:31:33,219 --> 00:31:37,019
Keeping them alive is second
to keeping them on time.

350
00:31:37,223 --> 00:31:40,317
I know he brings
them in steep and tight.

351
00:31:40,527 --> 00:31:44,122
But those airlines won't be
on my ass about delays...

352
00:31:44,364 --> 00:31:47,162
...while he's on the scopes.
He pushes tin.

353
00:31:50,203 --> 00:31:53,195
So, you gonna sign off on him or what?

354
00:31:53,973 --> 00:31:57,841
- Everyone likes him, I like him too.
- Everyone loves him.

355
00:31:58,044 --> 00:31:59,909
- What's not to like?
- Exactly.

356
00:32:00,146 --> 00:32:03,673
Ask all your buddies down there,
all those guys.

357
00:32:04,084 --> 00:32:09,078
Let me tell you something, Pat Sajak.
I say the guy's a loose cannon.

358
00:32:09,989 --> 00:32:12,389
Takes one to know one, Nicky.

359
00:32:15,395 --> 00:32:18,330
Take a dog.
I'm gonna run out of burgers.

360
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:21,928
Damn it!

361
00:32:22,168 --> 00:32:25,160
I left a note to use
alternate climb-outs.

362
00:32:25,371 --> 00:32:28,340
- Who's on departure?
- Probably Harrison.

363
00:32:28,541 --> 00:32:30,736
Harrison, you asshole!

364
00:32:31,177 --> 00:32:34,112
Every 747 tomorrow will blow his roof!

365
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:38,043
Well, at least it drowns out Falzone.

366
00:32:38,251 --> 00:32:42,620
- You believe he's never had a lesson?
- More beef, Todd?

367
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:57,729
My grandmother made sweaters.
You remind me of her.

368
00:32:57,937 --> 00:33:00,929
- Thank you.
- No, I don't mean it badly.

369
00:33:01,141 --> 00:33:04,736
I want you to make me one.
Would you make me one?

370
00:33:04,978 --> 00:33:06,639
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

371
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,575
- A red one?
- Lf you want.

372
00:33:08,782 --> 00:33:11,649
Barry gnashes his teeth while he sleeps.

373
00:33:11,885 --> 00:33:14,718
Ed did that until he got this jaw clamp.

374
00:33:14,954 --> 00:33:16,785
- Does it work?
- Very well.

375
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:19,151
He's gone through three.

376
00:33:19,392 --> 00:33:22,054
- Is it expensive?
- It's worth it.

377
00:33:22,295 --> 00:33:25,628
Turn angry postal workers
into a fighting force.

378
00:33:25,832 --> 00:33:28,392
Discipline would be a tall order...

379
00:33:28,601 --> 00:33:32,264
...but it would be perfect
for kamikaze missions.

380
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:34,139
Barry?

381
00:33:35,175 --> 00:33:39,111
Hi. Welcome. I'm Ed Clabes.
This is my party. You're...?

382
00:33:39,312 --> 00:33:42,247
- She'd make you pay for it.
- Shut up.

383
00:33:43,082 --> 00:33:46,779
- Real nice job.
- How are you doing? I'm Crystal.

384
00:33:46,986 --> 00:33:51,685
Zone, give me a beer.
Put them back in their holsters, boys.

385
00:33:51,925 --> 00:33:55,656
- That's Russell's wife.
- Russell's got a wife?

386
00:33:56,763 --> 00:34:02,099
- You invited Russell?
- Julie said he sounded interesting.

387
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:03,596
Problem, Nick?

388
00:34:03,803 --> 00:34:07,398
We get liquored up alone.
It's a tightknit group.

389
00:34:07,607 --> 00:34:09,768
It might upset our balance.

390
00:34:09,976 --> 00:34:14,003
- What's she doing with him?
- He's got her parents tied up.

391
00:34:14,781 --> 00:34:16,476
Hello.

392
00:34:17,951 --> 00:34:21,785
- How are you?
- We were just talking about you.

393
00:34:21,988 --> 00:34:24,786
- Zoner, get the man a beer.
- Coming up.

394
00:34:25,058 --> 00:34:28,152
- I don't drink.
- He doesn't drink.

395
00:34:28,394 --> 00:34:31,158
I met your wife. Very nice lady.

396
00:34:31,364 --> 00:34:33,355
Why don't I show you around?

397
00:34:35,902 --> 00:34:38,871
Let's go. Thanks so much for coming by.

398
00:34:39,072 --> 00:34:41,302
Glad you worked that one out.

399
00:34:44,844 --> 00:34:46,869
She's coming this way.

400
00:34:47,146 --> 00:34:50,047
- Act like you could give a shit.
- Relax.

401
00:34:50,416 --> 00:34:52,043
- Nick Falzone.
- Hi.

402
00:34:52,252 --> 00:34:55,085
- Maybe your husband mentioned me.
- Right.

403
00:34:55,321 --> 00:34:56,913
This is Barry and Ron.

404
00:34:57,156 --> 00:35:00,091
- Could I have a vodka tonic, please?
- Sure.

405
00:35:00,326 --> 00:35:05,389
Move out of the way. It's the
perfect accompaniment for burnt steak.

406
00:35:05,598 --> 00:35:08,396
- Honey, I need a refill.
- Hey, muffin.

407
00:35:09,335 --> 00:35:13,738
Hello. I'm Connie Falzone.
I just met your husband.

408
00:35:14,073 --> 00:35:17,201
- I'm Crystal. Nice to meet you.
- Oh, hi.

409
00:35:17,543 --> 00:35:20,068
Have you met my husband, Nick?

410
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:23,272
- No.
- Let's try that again. I'm Nick.

411
00:35:23,516 --> 00:35:27,577
- Here he is.
- I'm here all week. Nice to meet you.

412
00:35:27,921 --> 00:35:32,017
- So, Mary, do you have children?
- No, I don't.

413
00:35:32,225 --> 00:35:33,692
You don't?

414
00:35:34,761 --> 00:35:38,288
- No, please, come and sit down.
- Jeez, Louise!

415
00:35:38,531 --> 00:35:41,762
- She does a nice job for us.
- A fine job.

416
00:35:41,968 --> 00:35:43,299
My God.

417
00:35:54,147 --> 00:35:58,049
All right, game, game.
Free-throw contest.

418
00:35:58,251 --> 00:36:01,277
- I'll start.
- Okay.

419
00:36:01,554 --> 00:36:05,046
Get a room.
We're having a free-throw contest.

420
00:36:07,593 --> 00:36:09,458
Oh, come on.

421
00:36:09,662 --> 00:36:10,890
One!

422
00:36:11,164 --> 00:36:12,961
- Very nice.
- One!

423
00:36:17,637 --> 00:36:22,040
You know how it is. You ask
where he wants to go for dinner...

424
00:36:22,241 --> 00:36:23,902
...and he goes ballistic.

425
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:28,444
"I make 800 decisions a day.
You could make one tonight."

426
00:36:28,648 --> 00:36:32,778
- God forbid you make the wrong one.
- Because they never are.

427
00:36:32,986 --> 00:36:37,446
- They can't afford to be.
- Always sticking up for her husband.

428
00:36:37,657 --> 00:36:40,524
Don't forget. Connie's a first.

429
00:36:40,927 --> 00:36:43,191
Mary, what number are you?

430
00:36:43,696 --> 00:36:46,961
- I'm sorry. Number what?
- Which Mrs. Bell?

431
00:36:47,166 --> 00:36:52,035
Tanya and Crystal are seconds.
I'm a third. Linda's a fourth, right?

432
00:36:52,271 --> 00:36:55,172
At O'Hare, my best friend was a fifth.

433
00:36:55,375 --> 00:36:58,435
Or that's what she put away
every night.

434
00:37:01,848 --> 00:37:04,544
- It's not that funny.
- Come sit down.

435
00:37:06,019 --> 00:37:09,955
Seventeen! New record for The Zone!

436
00:37:18,197 --> 00:37:20,392
Too bad. Too bad.

437
00:37:20,666 --> 00:37:25,729
Ladies and gentlemen, world record!
Seventeen, Nick Falzone.

438
00:37:27,473 --> 00:37:31,500
It's a natural gift.
Anyone wanna go through the motions?

439
00:37:32,678 --> 00:37:35,670
- I'll go.
- Russell Bell.

440
00:37:36,382 --> 00:37:40,819
What's important is that Ed came home
with $100,000 last year...

441
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:43,284
...and he barely finished school.

442
00:37:43,489 --> 00:37:48,222
Even after we save money for the
kids' college and Ed's breakdown...

443
00:37:48,428 --> 00:37:51,829
...it's still a good chunk of change.
- Well done.

444
00:37:52,265 --> 00:37:53,755
Excuse me.

445
00:37:56,936 --> 00:37:59,996
Oh, by the way, I'm a first.

446
00:38:01,274 --> 00:38:04,038
Well, she's not gonna be the last.

447
00:38:04,243 --> 00:38:08,407
- Think they're real?
- Lf they are, we'll have to kill her.

448
00:38:09,615 --> 00:38:11,242
Nine!

449
00:38:22,962 --> 00:38:25,055
You trying to take my job?

450
00:38:25,264 --> 00:38:28,961
- Sorry, Barry. You the bartender here?
- Nick!

451
00:38:29,202 --> 00:38:32,296
- Nick. Nick, third time.
- Nick!

452
00:38:32,538 --> 00:38:35,405
I'll make you a tropical drink.

453
00:38:35,608 --> 00:38:40,671
- You'll feel no problems.
- What makes you think I have problems?

454
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:43,781
Everybody's got problems, don't they?

455
00:38:43,983 --> 00:38:48,420
- Is this the biggest glass?
- I could find a bucket for you.

456
00:38:49,822 --> 00:38:51,653
Fourteen!

457
00:38:56,162 --> 00:38:57,720
Fifteen!

458
00:38:59,665 --> 00:39:02,793
- Nice talking to you.
- Sixteen!

459
00:39:03,636 --> 00:39:04,967
Seventeen!

460
00:39:10,943 --> 00:39:14,640
That is 18! That is a new record!

461
00:39:29,629 --> 00:39:30,789
I wanna go home.

462
00:39:35,034 --> 00:39:38,663
- We're leaving.
- You'll get your winnings tomorrow.

463
00:39:38,871 --> 00:39:40,168
Bell!

464
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:44,241
- $100 says you can't hit it from there.
- Come on!

465
00:39:44,443 --> 00:39:46,877
- All right, 50¢.
- You said $100.

466
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:50,281
- I did say $100.
- You don't have to.

467
00:39:50,483 --> 00:39:52,508
- He's a gambling man.
- Come on.

468
00:39:52,718 --> 00:39:55,278
You could do a three-point shot.

469
00:40:03,563 --> 00:40:05,360
You were very close.

470
00:40:05,565 --> 00:40:08,329
Close enough. We'll call it even.

471
00:40:22,081 --> 00:40:24,572
You either make it or you don't.

472
00:40:26,219 --> 00:40:28,585
- See you.
- Thanks a lot.

473
00:40:28,854 --> 00:40:30,719
Yeah, see you Monday.

474
00:40:31,557 --> 00:40:35,550
Okay. I'm gonna shoot.
I'm gonna shoot.

475
00:40:35,761 --> 00:40:37,160
Ready?

476
00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:47,096
- Did you have a good time?
- Yeah. Did you?

477
00:40:47,673 --> 00:40:49,698
- Yeah.
- Good.

478
00:40:52,578 --> 00:40:54,944
What'd you think of the Bells?

479
00:40:55,581 --> 00:41:00,541
- I don't know. They're all right.
- She's a little standoffish, but...

480
00:41:00,753 --> 00:41:04,553
You know, I think she's
a bit of a sauce monster.

481
00:41:04,757 --> 00:41:07,521
- I think she's insecure.
- Maybe.

482
00:41:07,727 --> 00:41:10,389
Though she's very, very pretty.

483
00:41:10,596 --> 00:41:14,589
- You're prettier.
- Oh, gee. I don't think so.

484
00:41:14,867 --> 00:41:19,736
No, you are. Anybody says different,
I'll chop them into ground beef.

485
00:41:19,939 --> 00:41:21,372
Will you?

486
00:41:22,141 --> 00:41:25,372
- You're my guy.
- I know how to talk, right?

487
00:41:25,578 --> 00:41:27,876
Yeah. Not bad.

488
00:41:32,952 --> 00:41:36,479
What do you think of him?
He's weird, isn't he?

489
00:41:36,722 --> 00:41:38,280
Yeah.

490
00:41:39,425 --> 00:41:41,222
He's...

491
00:41:41,827 --> 00:41:43,920
He's sort of...

492
00:41:44,430 --> 00:41:46,261
...interesting.

493
00:41:46,966 --> 00:41:51,062
Eagle 4912, do not exceed 150 knots.
I'll give you a spin.

494
00:41:51,270 --> 00:41:54,239
Jetlink 3889, can you increase to 190?

495
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,771
No problem. 3889.

496
00:41:55,975 --> 00:41:58,739
Northwest 3518, descend.
Maintain 2000.

497
00:41:58,944 --> 00:42:03,643
- I have a hole. I need a plane.
- We can't get them all down at once.

498
00:42:03,849 --> 00:42:07,148
- Where's the hole?
- Here. Can you get me one?

499
00:42:07,353 --> 00:42:09,253
- You got it.
- Go ahead.

500
00:42:09,455 --> 00:42:13,414
- 744, cleared ILS runway 4.
- You're clear for approach.

501
00:42:13,659 --> 00:42:17,755
- 1783, descend. Maintain 5000.
- I got two more heavies.

502
00:42:17,963 --> 00:42:19,362
- I'll take them.
- Here.

503
00:42:19,632 --> 00:42:23,295
- 1698, traffic, 12:00. Do you see him?
- Will look.

504
00:42:23,536 --> 00:42:27,529
Keep searching. Inbound speed 160.
Now, 1698.

505
00:42:27,773 --> 00:42:29,673
- Easy.
- I want an airplane!

506
00:42:29,875 --> 00:42:31,502
- Where?
- By the United!

507
00:42:31,711 --> 00:42:34,771
- You'll have to slow that 747.
- I won't slow...

508
00:42:35,014 --> 00:42:36,345
747's with Russell.

509
00:42:36,549 --> 00:42:39,609
United 3426, you have traffic at 3:00.

510
00:42:39,819 --> 00:42:41,878
Continental, heading 141.

511
00:42:42,121 --> 00:42:45,318
Maintain 3000. Turn left 120.
What's Bob got?

512
00:42:45,558 --> 00:42:49,016
- This guy's got...
- What's he doing with that Delta?

513
00:42:49,228 --> 00:42:52,959
- I want the Delta.
- Kennedy rerouted a JAL heavy.

514
00:42:53,165 --> 00:42:55,690
- I got it!
- You don't have space.

515
00:42:55,901 --> 00:42:59,701
- I got a hole. I gotta take it now.
- Where's the hole?

516
00:42:59,905 --> 00:43:04,638
Behind the Delta. He'll bounce around
but I'll get him down.

517
00:43:05,745 --> 00:43:07,212
He's got no hole.

518
00:43:07,413 --> 00:43:09,847
- It's a hole.
- Gentlemen, please.

519
00:43:10,049 --> 00:43:13,917
Bring the Japan in.
I'm telling center to slow them.

520
00:43:14,153 --> 00:43:16,314
- This is nuts.
- It wasn't a hole.

521
00:43:16,522 --> 00:43:18,046
- It was.
- Was not.

522
00:43:18,257 --> 00:43:21,192
- Yes, it was.
- It wasn't a hole.

523
00:43:21,927 --> 00:43:23,519
It was. He's in it.

524
00:43:23,729 --> 00:43:25,196
- Ladies!
- It's a hole.

525
00:43:25,398 --> 00:43:27,559
Can we direct some traffic?

526
00:43:31,103 --> 00:43:33,367
- You wanna come with me?
- Where?

527
00:43:33,606 --> 00:43:35,267
Doughnut fix.

528
00:43:37,610 --> 00:43:40,511
Yeah. Let's do it.

529
00:44:58,157 --> 00:45:00,591
Don't get any greener.

530
00:45:09,835 --> 00:45:11,462
Get out of the road!

531
00:45:11,770 --> 00:45:13,499
Out!

532
00:45:17,543 --> 00:45:18,942
Oh, good. It's open.

533
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:25,608
- I want a croissant.
- Croissants are bread.

534
00:45:25,818 --> 00:45:29,345
- Croissants are pastry.
- No. Pastry's sweet.

535
00:45:29,555 --> 00:45:31,455
Not all of it.

536
00:45:31,891 --> 00:45:34,382
They don't have croissants.

537
00:46:05,558 --> 00:46:07,321
Mrs. Bell?

538
00:46:08,928 --> 00:46:11,089
God, please take me now.

539
00:46:13,098 --> 00:46:16,067
- Is there anything I can do?
- No, I'm fine.

540
00:46:17,069 --> 00:46:20,368
Is this man bothering you?
What did you say?

541
00:46:20,573 --> 00:46:24,669
Go away. Move it.
Go battle evil on aisle 12.

542
00:46:28,614 --> 00:46:31,515
- You have no idea how I hate this.
- What?

543
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:36,551
- Men feel superior when women cry.
- I don't. I cry all the time.

544
00:46:36,755 --> 00:46:38,689
- You do?
- I'm famous for it.

545
00:46:38,891 --> 00:46:41,860
I've never cried at the supermarket.

546
00:46:42,061 --> 00:46:47,124
I cry at old movies, songs, weddings.
I cried like a baby at my own.

547
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:50,268
Where's Russell tonight?

548
00:46:51,470 --> 00:46:53,961
- Gone.
- He's gone where?

549
00:46:54,206 --> 00:46:56,003
I don't know.

550
00:46:56,208 --> 00:47:00,702
He takes off on his motorcycle
and says he'll see me tomorrow.

551
00:47:02,114 --> 00:47:04,048
I understand.

552
00:47:04,550 --> 00:47:07,383
No, you don't understand.
That's not it.

553
00:47:07,586 --> 00:47:12,387
- Men aren't the only reason women cry.
- He's nuts for leaving you.

554
00:47:12,625 --> 00:47:17,392
That's just Russell. It's just
something he does. All right?

555
00:47:17,596 --> 00:47:21,293
This is what I have come to do.
Discuss my marriage...

556
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:26,335
...in a supermarket with a fucking
stranger. Goodbye, Mr. Falzone.

557
00:47:34,913 --> 00:47:36,608
Mrs. Bell?

558
00:47:36,982 --> 00:47:38,711
God! What?

559
00:47:38,917 --> 00:47:43,911
Listen. I know this great,
I'm talking great, Italian restaurant.

560
00:47:44,990 --> 00:47:50,155
It's a family-owned, local joint.
Best things aren't even on the menu.

561
00:47:51,430 --> 00:47:55,662
- You're asking me out?
- No. My wife has an art class.

562
00:47:55,868 --> 00:48:00,430
I hate eating alone in restaurants.
It's a humanitarian gesture.

563
00:48:00,673 --> 00:48:03,870
You should eat
before you hit that vodka.

564
00:48:07,012 --> 00:48:12,040
- Whatever I order will be on me.
- It's all right. We'll get you a bib.

565
00:48:14,887 --> 00:48:19,415
Tell me something. Are there people
who find you charming?

566
00:48:19,625 --> 00:48:22,856
Well, they pretend
because I try so hard.

567
00:49:02,901 --> 00:49:04,698
He's fantastic, yes?

568
00:49:05,337 --> 00:49:06,668
Here you go.

569
00:49:08,907 --> 00:49:13,105
Come on. See, that's a nice smile.

570
00:49:13,378 --> 00:49:15,346
First time you used it?

571
00:49:15,547 --> 00:49:18,573
I'm really not as big a bitch as you think.

572
00:49:18,784 --> 00:49:21,912
I've formed absolutely no opinion of you.

573
00:49:31,063 --> 00:49:33,361
So who are you? What do you...?

574
00:49:33,565 --> 00:49:36,591
What do you like to do? Do you work?

575
00:49:37,636 --> 00:49:40,537
Yeah, I do. I'm a social worker.

576
00:49:43,442 --> 00:49:44,932
Is that right?

577
00:49:46,311 --> 00:49:51,146
I took some classes, but I can't
even get volunteer work here.

578
00:49:51,750 --> 00:49:56,483
- Nobody in New York needs any help.
- No, we're all doing fine.

579
00:49:58,457 --> 00:50:02,791
Cheers. It's better than
the frozen food section.

580
00:50:07,833 --> 00:50:13,135
I never get drunk. I drink a lot.
I got the constitution of a walrus.

581
00:50:13,338 --> 00:50:17,172
Do that thing.
Put your hand up there. Yeah, see?

582
00:50:17,409 --> 00:50:21,846
That's definitely your evil side.
It's an angel.

583
00:50:22,114 --> 00:50:24,742
- You like the evil one.
- That one's bad.

584
00:50:24,950 --> 00:50:27,976
It's got a nice
Dorothy Hamill vibe going.

585
00:50:28,921 --> 00:50:33,017
So besides getting tattoos,
what are your hobbies?

586
00:50:33,592 --> 00:50:36,584
- Everybody's good at something.
- I read.

587
00:50:36,929 --> 00:50:39,796
You like to read?
Fiction, romance stuff?

588
00:50:40,032 --> 00:50:42,500
- Sure.
- Well, that's fun.

589
00:50:43,669 --> 00:50:47,332
Tons of fun. And I grow things.

590
00:50:47,539 --> 00:50:49,166
- Pardon?
- I grow things.

591
00:50:51,844 --> 00:50:54,312
- Flowers?
- And plants, usually.

592
00:50:54,546 --> 00:50:56,980
Some flowers, yeah. Just...

593
00:50:57,850 --> 00:50:59,875
That's nice.

594
00:51:00,953 --> 00:51:02,614
Wanna know something?

595
00:51:04,857 --> 00:51:10,318
I was crying in the supermarket
because I lost a plant today.

596
00:51:12,164 --> 00:51:15,725
My fuchsia hybrida voodoo died
this morning.

597
00:51:18,303 --> 00:51:21,966
I carried that plant on my lap
all over the country.

598
00:51:22,975 --> 00:51:24,704
It was like a pet.

599
00:51:24,910 --> 00:51:28,903
I'd take it into every bedroom
and put it by the bed...

600
00:51:29,147 --> 00:51:32,844
...and it'd make everything
feel cozy and familiar.

601
00:51:40,259 --> 00:51:42,659
Now, what, you think I'm crazy?

602
00:51:43,896 --> 00:51:49,095
I think you're a very intelligent woman,
who is in a new city...

603
00:51:50,235 --> 00:51:53,693
...who is lonely and a little scared.

604
00:51:57,743 --> 00:51:59,335
I love my husband.

605
00:52:00,412 --> 00:52:01,606
I love my wife.

606
00:52:01,847 --> 00:52:04,941
Here you go. My best Barbaresco.

607
00:52:08,086 --> 00:52:13,353
- Goddamn it, I'm in love with you.
- I'm in love with you too.

608
00:52:13,558 --> 00:52:17,460
Enzo, when you love somebody,
it's no good.

609
00:52:19,564 --> 00:52:21,623
He's gonna go sing now.

610
00:52:33,278 --> 00:52:34,802
Everybody!

611
00:52:51,463 --> 00:52:55,456
- Thanks for eating with me.
- Thank you.

612
00:52:55,834 --> 00:52:58,234
- Hope you had a good time.
- I did.

613
00:52:58,437 --> 00:53:01,463
- Good.
- I did.

614
00:53:03,075 --> 00:53:06,806
Be all right getting home?
You've had a lot of wine.

615
00:53:07,012 --> 00:53:10,470
- Want me to follow you?
- No, I'll be fine.

616
00:53:10,682 --> 00:53:14,516
No Russell at home,
no fuchsia hybrida voodoo.

617
00:53:14,753 --> 00:53:16,744
Hey, you remembered.

618
00:53:16,955 --> 00:53:20,254
It's my job, listening
and remembering things.

619
00:53:21,526 --> 00:53:23,619
- Yeah, I'll be fine.
- Okay.

620
00:53:24,296 --> 00:53:28,824
- Then I guess this is good night.
- Good night. See you around.

621
00:54:05,804 --> 00:54:10,070
I've had quite a bit of wine.
You should follow me home.

622
00:54:27,759 --> 00:54:29,488
Well, good night.

623
00:55:05,263 --> 00:55:07,629
I'm so sorry.

624
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:09,531
What?

625
00:55:11,369 --> 00:55:13,701
I wasn't talking to you.

626
00:55:15,140 --> 00:55:17,233
Who were you talking to?

627
00:55:19,778 --> 00:55:21,643
God, I guess.

628
00:55:24,149 --> 00:55:27,949
Do we go directly
from afterglow to shame?

629
00:55:29,988 --> 00:55:34,322
Russell's not gonna come in here
and burst in on us, is he?

630
00:55:35,327 --> 00:55:37,887
No, he's usually gone all night.

631
00:55:39,798 --> 00:55:42,494
How do you know? Where does he go?

632
00:55:44,402 --> 00:55:48,736
- I don't know.
- I mean, don't you ever ask him?

633
00:55:51,143 --> 00:55:55,079
You're really interested in Russell,
you know that?

634
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:57,111
No, no. What do you mean?

635
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:04,980
Can I ask you something personal?

636
00:56:07,325 --> 00:56:11,022
Whatever we do,
let's not get personal tonight.

637
00:56:11,463 --> 00:56:13,954
Have you ever done this before?

638
00:56:17,369 --> 00:56:20,497
That is a truly horrible question.

639
00:56:26,822 --> 00:56:30,053
It's the first time
I've ever cheated on him.

640
00:56:30,893 --> 00:56:35,262
I don't know why I did it.
I didn't want to be alone and he's...

641
00:56:39,268 --> 00:56:41,532
He keeps to himself a lot.

642
00:56:49,612 --> 00:56:51,739
What time is it, anyway?

643
00:56:55,951 --> 00:56:57,782
Hey, I better...

644
00:56:58,354 --> 00:57:02,518
I better get going.
It's getting kind of late, you know?

645
00:57:02,725 --> 00:57:07,128
I got my wife coming back
from art class and I don't know if...

646
00:57:11,767 --> 00:57:14,258
- Bye.
- Right.

647
00:57:16,805 --> 00:57:18,238
So...

648
00:57:18,741 --> 00:57:21,437
...Mary, if we don't talk
or anything...

649
00:57:21,644 --> 00:57:26,104
...don't take that as a reflection
on you or anything.

650
00:57:26,315 --> 00:57:31,218
You strike me as someone
who might take things...

651
00:57:34,790 --> 00:57:38,886
Who might take that stuff personally.
Don't think...

652
00:57:39,128 --> 00:57:41,562
- Mr. Falzone?
- Nick! Call me Nick.

653
00:57:41,764 --> 00:57:45,962
What are the fewest number of words
you can use to leave?

654
00:57:46,168 --> 00:57:48,728
I see. Very few.

655
00:57:51,073 --> 00:57:55,237
I want you to know I never planned
on sleeping with you.

656
00:57:55,444 --> 00:58:00,848
It was strange, and I enjoyed it
and I'll see you around.

657
00:58:03,419 --> 00:58:04,977
- Hey, baby.
- Hey.

658
00:58:05,254 --> 00:58:08,553
Wait. Come here.
I wanna show you something.

659
00:58:08,757 --> 00:58:11,123
Ready? Come here.

660
00:58:12,861 --> 00:58:15,329
- Did it in class tonight.
- J.F. K.?

661
00:58:16,198 --> 00:58:18,928
- You could tell?
- Looks just like him.

662
00:58:20,469 --> 00:58:23,165
You know, I feel like I know him.

663
00:58:23,372 --> 00:58:28,139
Yeah, we all do. That's an
original Falzone. We gotta hang it up.

664
00:58:28,343 --> 00:58:31,335
I'm gonna hit the shower. Guess what?

665
00:58:31,547 --> 00:58:35,039
- I had a hot date tonight.
- You did?

666
00:58:35,284 --> 00:58:37,149
- With who?
- Listen to this.

667
00:58:37,352 --> 00:58:40,651
I run into Mary Bell
at the supermarket.

668
00:58:40,856 --> 00:58:44,292
She's crying.
She had a nervous breakdown.

669
00:58:44,493 --> 00:58:47,894
Her plant had died.
Some craziness, right?

670
00:58:48,130 --> 00:58:51,691
- So I took her to Enzo's.
- Enzo's?

671
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:53,800
That was nice of you.

672
00:58:54,002 --> 00:58:58,666
Russell split town on her and
she was having a nervous breakdown.

673
00:58:58,874 --> 00:59:02,742
Sweet kid, so I just
sobered her up a bit, you know?

674
00:59:03,212 --> 00:59:05,305
It was real nice of you.

675
00:59:05,514 --> 00:59:08,972
- Well, I didn't know...
- I should call her.

676
00:59:15,023 --> 00:59:18,151
Have you seen Russell
around anywhere?

677
00:59:18,827 --> 00:59:22,524
- He was here a minute ago.
- Yeah? How did he seem?

678
00:59:22,731 --> 00:59:26,030
- What do you mean?
- How did he seem?

679
00:59:27,035 --> 00:59:31,938
I'll give him a complete physical
the next time I run into him.

680
00:59:34,576 --> 00:59:36,339
- Hello.
- Hey, honey.

681
00:59:36,545 --> 00:59:38,342
Great. Nicky, what's up?

682
00:59:38,547 --> 00:59:43,075
You wanna have dinner tonight with me?
Relax a little together?

683
00:59:43,352 --> 00:59:46,913
Sure. Okay. At Enzo's?

684
00:59:47,122 --> 00:59:49,249
- No, someplace else.
- Where?

685
00:59:49,458 --> 00:59:52,825
- You pick.
- What's wrong with Enzo's?

686
00:59:53,028 --> 00:59:57,795
- Bad experience with Mary Bell?
- It would've been better with you.

687
00:59:58,066 --> 01:00:00,694
- I mean, Enzo's would've been.
- Right.

688
01:00:00,936 --> 01:00:04,201
They treat us better
when we're both there.

689
01:00:04,406 --> 01:00:07,967
- I hadn't noticed that.
- Right. Enzo's it is.

690
01:00:10,879 --> 01:00:13,439
- I love you.
- I love you too.

691
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:29,056
- What's that racket?
- Enzo's getting good, huh?

692
01:00:33,468 --> 01:00:35,959
- Mr. And Mrs. Falzone.
- How are you?

693
01:00:36,238 --> 01:00:39,503
- I'm fine, thanks.
- Jesus Christ.

694
01:00:40,676 --> 01:00:45,113
Mr. And Mrs. Falzone, welcome.
It's so good to see you.

695
01:00:46,315 --> 01:00:49,045
- Your table is this way.
- Wanna leave?

696
01:00:49,251 --> 01:00:52,345
- It's Russell.
- Yeah, I know. I saw him.

697
01:01:07,469 --> 01:01:09,096
Don't worry.

698
01:01:09,805 --> 01:01:14,333
- Is there a table by the window?
- Sorry. We're full tonight.

699
01:01:28,991 --> 01:01:31,357
- They should join us.
- Who?

700
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:33,050
- The Bells.
- No.

701
01:01:33,295 --> 01:01:36,355
- Why not?
- This is a romantic dinner.

702
01:01:36,565 --> 01:01:40,899
- We're in that mode.
- Your husband has a beautiful voice.

703
01:01:41,136 --> 01:01:42,626
- Hi, Mary.
- Hi.

704
01:01:43,171 --> 01:01:45,662
- Nice to see you.
- Bruschetta.

705
01:01:45,874 --> 01:01:47,739
Bruschetta. Nick, my friend.

706
01:01:47,976 --> 01:01:49,500
- Enzo.
- And Connie.

707
01:01:50,078 --> 01:01:53,206
This place is filled
with beautiful women.

708
01:01:53,482 --> 01:01:56,383
You and Russell work together?

709
01:01:56,585 --> 01:02:00,817
He's an interesting guy.
And a beautiful voice too.

710
01:02:01,023 --> 01:02:03,890
- Thank you.
- I'll be back with the specials.

711
01:02:05,527 --> 01:02:09,520
- Would you like...?
- With little Nicky and the ADD thing?

712
01:02:09,731 --> 01:02:13,167
Does he need Ritalin?
Could he grow out of it?

713
01:02:13,402 --> 01:02:16,894
Yeah. We've done
all the allergy tests. Honey?

714
01:02:17,105 --> 01:02:20,165
He's not allergic
to chocolate or wheat.

715
01:02:20,409 --> 01:02:24,505
I think he should be okay.
Maybe some sort of relaxation.

716
01:02:24,746 --> 01:02:27,840
- Summer camp?
- He's focused on the ice.

717
01:02:28,083 --> 01:02:32,349
He got cross-checked in the first
period and he remembered.

718
01:02:32,554 --> 01:02:35,717
Third period,
he zeroed in on that punk.

719
01:02:35,924 --> 01:02:40,054
He got a five-minute major.
Very focused, tough individual.

720
01:02:40,262 --> 01:02:43,254
- Little man in a big man's shoes.
- You okay?

721
01:02:43,532 --> 01:02:46,262
I guess their kid plays hockey.

722
01:02:47,569 --> 01:02:52,302
- You play sports?
- I bowled when I was an alcoholic.

723
01:02:53,742 --> 01:02:54,970
Did it help?

724
01:02:59,114 --> 01:03:01,275
- This is ridiculous.
- What is?

725
01:03:02,818 --> 01:03:04,809
Would you like to join us?

726
01:03:05,754 --> 01:03:08,382
Well, not a drink, but...

727
01:03:08,890 --> 01:03:10,448
Honey?

728
01:03:10,792 --> 01:03:14,626
- I'd really appreciate it.
- Why not?

729
01:03:16,231 --> 01:03:21,294
I wouldn't trade it for anything.
That was a great way to grow up...

730
01:03:21,503 --> 01:03:25,166
...with no electricity
or running water or anything.

731
01:03:25,407 --> 01:03:29,309
My grandfather was raised
on a reservation in Oklahoma.

732
01:03:29,578 --> 01:03:34,880
Is that where the alcohol problem began?
It must've been hard, socially.

733
01:03:35,083 --> 01:03:36,948
- Not at all.
- We drink a lot.

734
01:03:37,152 --> 01:03:40,121
I don't, but the guys at work do.

735
01:03:40,322 --> 01:03:44,759
- It's more a spiritual thing.
- Was that a problem at school?

736
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:47,622
- What, liquor?
- No, being Indian.

737
01:03:47,829 --> 01:03:50,093
- Half.
- I'm sorry. Nick said...

738
01:03:50,332 --> 01:03:52,664
No, don't apologize. I'm half.

739
01:03:52,934 --> 01:03:54,458
- Right.
- My dad's Irish.

740
01:03:54,669 --> 01:03:57,263
- Your mom's...?
- My mom's Choctaw.

741
01:03:57,506 --> 01:03:59,667
- Choctop.
- Choctaw. Not Choctop.

742
01:03:59,875 --> 01:04:01,809
I thought you said Choctop.

743
01:04:02,010 --> 01:04:05,275
My grandmother's Italian,
and that's hard.

744
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:08,108
- In the '50s...
- It's hard to be Italian?

745
01:04:08,350 --> 01:04:09,874
No. I love it.

746
01:04:10,118 --> 01:04:15,146
I don't speak it or anything.
It was hard for them, the acceptance.

747
01:04:15,357 --> 01:04:19,123
- Tastes like chicken.
- They say that about crocodile.

748
01:04:19,327 --> 01:04:23,320
My dear friends. We have
many requests for another song.

749
01:04:23,799 --> 01:04:27,064
Russell, would you do another for us?

750
01:05:12,747 --> 01:05:17,946
Don't ever call me at work again.
Don't ever go to Sorrento's again.

751
01:05:18,186 --> 01:05:20,051
- Fine.
- What do you need?

752
01:05:20,288 --> 01:05:21,687
I told Russell.

753
01:05:22,624 --> 01:05:24,751
- You told him what?
- About us.

754
01:05:28,930 --> 01:05:33,526
Why did you do that?
Why would you do something like that?

755
01:05:34,636 --> 01:05:38,231
What are you, fucking nuts?
Why would you do that?

756
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:41,238
Tell me why you'd do... Are you sick?

757
01:05:43,378 --> 01:05:48,782
Last night was a major moment in our
marriage. We reached this honesty...

758
01:05:48,984 --> 01:05:53,478
...and he shared something with me
that was unbelievably personal.

759
01:05:53,722 --> 01:05:55,087
What?!

760
01:05:55,657 --> 01:05:57,488
Like I'm gonna tell you.

761
01:05:58,493 --> 01:06:01,792
It was important I share
with him in return.

762
01:06:01,997 --> 01:06:05,899
You know I gotta work with this guy?
We work together!

763
01:06:06,501 --> 01:06:09,993
I know. It's okay. He's not upset.

764
01:06:13,341 --> 01:06:15,138
Yeah, right!

765
01:06:15,410 --> 01:06:18,243
- He's all right about it.
- Bullshit!

766
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:23,440
You understand? It's never all right!
I'm a man! He's a man! Trust me!

767
01:06:23,685 --> 01:06:27,121
It's never all right. Ever! Ever!

768
01:06:27,322 --> 01:06:31,918
- He was moved that I was so honest.
- Oh, Jesus!

769
01:06:32,327 --> 01:06:35,490
- He surprises me.
- Maybe it's for the best.

770
01:06:35,697 --> 01:06:39,394
Assuming that Russell
doesn't shoot me in the eyes...

771
01:06:39,601 --> 01:06:42,832
...l'll change.
I haven't been the best husband.

772
01:06:43,038 --> 01:06:48,169
I acted on the occasional wrong impulse.
I've taken the detour...

773
01:06:48,376 --> 01:06:50,503
I'm way too sober for this.

774
01:07:15,370 --> 01:07:18,999
I wanna say something
then you do what you must.

775
01:07:19,207 --> 01:07:21,334
I must be losing my mind.

776
01:07:21,543 --> 01:07:25,206
To do that to another controller
is inexcusable.

777
01:07:25,413 --> 01:07:28,576
It was 99% alcohol...
You don't wanna hear that.

778
01:07:28,817 --> 01:07:32,184
I don't even wanna hear it or say it.

779
01:07:32,420 --> 01:07:36,982
Whatever we have to do to make it
right, I wanna make it right.

780
01:07:37,826 --> 01:07:40,317
So if you wanna take a swing at me...

781
01:07:41,596 --> 01:07:45,327
...I want you to know,
I wouldn't swing back.

782
01:07:46,835 --> 01:07:48,234
Come on.

783
01:07:49,404 --> 01:07:50,530
It's okay.

784
01:07:51,273 --> 01:07:53,070
Have a seat.

785
01:07:57,679 --> 01:07:59,169
Sit with me.

786
01:08:09,858 --> 01:08:12,588
It's okay. Sit with me.

787
01:08:29,311 --> 01:08:32,803
My grandfather said,
"If you wanna sleep at night...

788
01:08:33,048 --> 01:08:35,778
...don't marry a young, beautiful woman."

789
01:08:36,484 --> 01:08:38,281
Well, I did.

790
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:42,918
A 40-year-old man, I married
a beautiful 19-year-old girl.

791
01:08:43,158 --> 01:08:46,821
I've learned to accept things.
I know the dangers.

792
01:08:47,329 --> 01:08:52,767
I've also been on the other side,
the one following the little pink panties.

793
01:08:54,402 --> 01:08:57,667
It's torturous. We're men.
We can't help it.

794
01:08:58,773 --> 01:09:00,604
It's not fair.

795
01:09:05,447 --> 01:09:07,915
We have a huge burden on us.

796
01:09:08,183 --> 01:09:11,641
Jesus, you're being incredible
about this, Bell.

797
01:09:12,954 --> 01:09:16,082
I mean, amazing. Really.

798
01:09:16,424 --> 01:09:20,827
You're married to a beautiful woman.
You should understand.

799
01:09:21,863 --> 01:09:25,424
- Connie?
- Yeah, Connie.

800
01:09:25,934 --> 01:09:29,597
I mean, she's gorgeous.
My God, she's gorgeous.

801
01:09:29,804 --> 01:09:32,705
You must go crazy
when men gawk at her.

802
01:09:34,843 --> 01:09:36,868
If this happened to you...

803
01:09:37,345 --> 01:09:42,510
...if you were in this situation,
you'd understand.

804
01:09:42,884 --> 01:09:46,115
You might not like it,
but you'd understand.

805
01:09:48,823 --> 01:09:52,190
- I don't think I would.
- You might be surprised.

806
01:09:52,394 --> 01:09:54,123
I really don't think so.

807
01:09:54,329 --> 01:09:57,560
Human beings can tolerate
a lot of pain.

808
01:09:58,867 --> 01:10:01,495
You never know until it happens.

809
01:10:22,690 --> 01:10:25,158
- Hi there.
- How you doing?

810
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:28,989
Fine. Nick invited me for lunch.

811
01:10:29,197 --> 01:10:31,665
It's a beautiful day for it.

812
01:10:32,500 --> 01:10:35,901
With your complexion,
you must get a great tan.

813
01:10:36,104 --> 01:10:40,234
I spend 10 minutes outside,
they have to do skin grafts.

814
01:10:41,910 --> 01:10:45,778
- Where'd you learn to sing like that?
- I'm sorry?

815
01:10:46,014 --> 01:10:48,175
Your singing was beautiful.

816
01:10:48,383 --> 01:10:52,911
My father. He was a professional
singer, among other things.

817
01:10:53,388 --> 01:10:57,722
- What are you listening to?
- French tapes.

818
01:10:59,127 --> 01:11:01,254
You're learning French?

819
01:11:03,097 --> 01:11:06,260
- I like to learn new things.
- Me too.

820
01:11:07,101 --> 01:11:10,366
- You speak it?
- French? Me? No.

821
01:11:10,605 --> 01:11:15,736
I've always wanted to learn, though.
They say it's the language of love.

822
01:11:15,944 --> 01:11:18,606
I'm not sure how much I love it.

823
01:11:19,881 --> 01:11:21,473
But...

824
01:11:25,553 --> 01:11:27,544
That is nice.

825
01:11:30,758 --> 01:11:35,661
If you're interested,
I'll loan you these when I'm finished.

826
01:11:36,397 --> 01:11:40,060
- That might be fun.
- What might be fun, sweetheart?

827
01:11:40,735 --> 01:11:43,397
- Hi, baby.
- Bye.

828
01:11:48,843 --> 01:11:50,276
Hi, Russell.

829
01:11:53,081 --> 01:11:54,275
Au revoir.

830
01:11:57,819 --> 01:12:00,151
What might be fun, sweetheart?

831
01:12:00,355 --> 01:12:01,822
What might be fun?

832
01:12:02,023 --> 01:12:07,461
Oh, Russell? He's got French tapes
he's gonna loan me. Be able to...

833
01:12:07,829 --> 01:12:11,458
You barely know the guy.
You call him Russell?

834
01:12:11,666 --> 01:12:14,692
I know him.
What's your problem with him?

835
01:12:14,936 --> 01:12:16,301
I don't have one.

836
01:12:16,504 --> 01:12:20,702
He's a lowlife, but that's
his problem. It's not mine.

837
01:12:21,809 --> 01:12:25,142
- I don't like what he said about you.
- What?

838
01:12:25,380 --> 01:12:29,339
- He said you were attractive.
- Really?

839
01:12:30,618 --> 01:12:33,610
- He used the word "attractive"?
- Yes, he did.

840
01:12:36,057 --> 01:12:40,118
- What was the context...?
- The context was... I don't remember.

841
01:12:40,328 --> 01:12:43,024
- Right.
- That was the context.

842
01:12:43,498 --> 01:12:47,298
I got 30 minutes.
I don't wanna talk about him.

843
01:12:47,535 --> 01:12:50,527
We'll talk about
what you wanna talk about.

844
01:12:54,142 --> 01:12:57,043
Does he call you
Connie or Mrs. Falzone?

845
01:12:57,245 --> 01:12:59,509
No, honey. It's "babycakes."

846
01:13:03,685 --> 01:13:06,415
Tommy boy,
I haven't seen you in years.

847
01:13:06,654 --> 01:13:09,680
- No kidding.
- What are you doing here?

848
01:13:09,891 --> 01:13:12,724
- I'm filling in tonight.
- Who for?

849
01:13:12,927 --> 01:13:14,326
Bell.

850
01:13:18,066 --> 01:13:23,265
- Where'd he have to go tonight?
- I don't know. He called me to switch.

851
01:13:24,872 --> 01:13:26,863
Well, is he sick?

852
01:13:27,175 --> 01:13:28,904
No, he sounded good.

853
01:13:31,079 --> 01:13:34,207
Hello. This is the Falzone residence.

854
01:13:34,415 --> 01:13:39,546
We're not in, but leave your name
and number and we'll call you back.

855
01:13:39,754 --> 01:13:41,551
How do you turn it off?

856
01:13:41,756 --> 01:13:45,192
You there? You screening?
Don't screen. Pick up.

857
01:13:45,393 --> 01:13:46,883
Nicky?

858
01:13:47,695 --> 01:13:49,356
Connie?

859
01:13:51,432 --> 01:13:53,696
Okay, talk to you later. Bye.

860
01:13:58,573 --> 01:14:00,438
Bonjour.

861
01:14:01,542 --> 01:14:06,536
Let's welcome to tonight's Muscle
Queen contest, three young ladies...

862
01:14:06,781 --> 01:14:10,615
...whose mission it is
to tone the whole body.

863
01:14:10,885 --> 01:14:15,219
I don't know. I think she's
screwing around with Russell.

864
01:14:22,497 --> 01:14:24,397
Connie and Russell Bell?

865
01:14:24,599 --> 01:14:29,798
- Okay, what do you got?
- Nothing concrete. I got a gut feeling.

866
01:14:30,471 --> 01:14:33,463
- That's not...
- Connie's crazy about you.

867
01:14:33,675 --> 01:14:38,578
Besides, only scum would screw around
with another controller's wife.

868
01:14:38,913 --> 01:14:43,282
- There are exceptions to every rule.
- What's wrong with you?

869
01:14:44,585 --> 01:14:48,578
And now, our first contestant,
Miss Tina Leary.

870
01:15:02,437 --> 01:15:04,701
I did something stupid.

871
01:15:04,972 --> 01:15:07,805
- What did you do?
- Like, really stupid.

872
01:15:14,282 --> 01:15:17,149
I ran into Mary Bell
at the supermarket.

873
01:15:18,052 --> 01:15:21,544
She was upset over a plant.
She was a mess.

874
01:15:21,789 --> 01:15:25,122
Forget about the plant.
You know how she looks.

875
01:15:25,326 --> 01:15:30,059
I felt sorry for her. We went
to dinner. We had too much to drink...

876
01:15:30,331 --> 01:15:34,665
Okay, wait.
You bopped Mary Bell? Did you?

877
01:15:36,537 --> 01:15:38,232
Just once.

878
01:15:47,415 --> 01:15:50,043
A controller's wife. I broke the rule.

879
01:15:50,318 --> 01:15:53,719
At least you're disgusted
with your behavior.

880
01:15:53,921 --> 01:15:58,324
That's something, isn't it?
It counts for something.

881
01:15:58,526 --> 01:16:02,462
That'll teach Russell
to take on more planes than you.

882
01:16:02,663 --> 01:16:07,157
- I think he's trying to...
- You're starting to worry me.

883
01:16:08,102 --> 01:16:10,332
You're starting to worry me.

884
01:16:11,773 --> 01:16:16,107
This job can get to people.
Sometimes this job gets to people.

885
01:16:16,911 --> 01:16:20,369
- The universe tends towards chaos.
- What?

886
01:16:20,581 --> 01:16:22,845
It tends towards chaos.

887
01:16:23,050 --> 01:16:27,612
We're the last line of defense
against chaos in the sky.

888
01:16:28,723 --> 01:16:31,453
It can be too much of a burden.

889
01:16:31,726 --> 01:16:36,026
You know? It can be more
than the human mind...

890
01:16:36,230 --> 01:16:39,290
Yeah, I know what you mean. I got it.

891
01:16:42,537 --> 01:16:45,267
You're not screwing my wife, are you?

892
01:16:47,275 --> 01:16:48,606
This is crazy.

893
01:16:51,078 --> 01:16:53,273
Baby, you look so good!

894
01:16:54,115 --> 01:16:55,605
Connie?

895
01:17:01,923 --> 01:17:03,481
What's going on?

896
01:17:07,895 --> 01:17:10,591
Everything okay? Hey, buddy.

897
01:17:10,798 --> 01:17:15,565
- Run along. I need to talk to Daddy.
- Hey, Dr. T.

898
01:17:18,739 --> 01:17:21,230
- What is it?
- Sit down, Nick.

899
01:17:24,979 --> 01:17:29,973
I've been explaining to the kids
what it means that Daddy...

900
01:17:31,252 --> 01:17:33,686
...won't be around anymore.

901
01:17:40,695 --> 01:17:42,526
Hey, Connie.

902
01:17:43,297 --> 01:17:44,662
Wait a minute.

903
01:17:48,836 --> 01:17:51,703
Do you even wanna hear
my side of this?

904
01:17:52,306 --> 01:17:55,434
What's your side of my father dying?

905
01:18:01,515 --> 01:18:05,417
- It's a terrible shock.
- He's been sick for three years.

906
01:18:05,620 --> 01:18:07,349
You're never prepared.

907
01:18:07,555 --> 01:18:12,390
Don't worry. They can stay
with Laura and Kevin.

908
01:18:12,627 --> 01:18:16,723
But I gotta leave tomorrow.
So I've left three casseroles...

909
01:18:16,964 --> 01:18:20,661
- You assume I'm not going?
- You never take time off...

910
01:18:20,868 --> 01:18:23,200
I'll take time off.

911
01:18:25,740 --> 01:18:28,402
- I'll take time off.
- You sure?

912
01:18:30,578 --> 01:18:32,569
I got these for you.

913
01:18:35,049 --> 01:18:38,576
- Are you okay?
- Oh, yeah, yeah. I mean, no, no.

914
01:18:40,988 --> 01:18:44,048
Oh, my daddy's gone.

915
01:19:15,189 --> 01:19:16,850
Was that French?

916
01:19:17,091 --> 01:19:18,615
What?

917
01:19:18,926 --> 01:19:21,554
Did you say goodbye in French?

918
01:19:21,762 --> 01:19:24,925
- Yes. I did.
- That's lovely, Connie.

919
01:19:37,812 --> 01:19:42,909
I'll never forget the first night I met him.
He was a wonderful man.

920
01:19:43,117 --> 01:19:47,577
He said he thought no man
was good enough for his daughter.

921
01:19:47,822 --> 01:19:50,950
Then he met me, and he was sure of it.

922
01:19:51,459 --> 01:19:55,987
He said, "If you're not good enough
for her, then no one is."

923
01:19:57,264 --> 01:19:59,494
He had a sense of humor.

924
01:20:00,301 --> 01:20:03,464
He spoke his mind. He wasn't devious.

925
01:20:04,505 --> 01:20:07,338
He didn't sneak around
behind your back.

926
01:20:07,575 --> 01:20:11,170
He didn't ride around on a motorcycle.

927
01:20:27,762 --> 01:20:30,356
I didn't realize you knew French.

928
01:20:32,199 --> 01:20:35,293
I've been listening to tapes for weeks.

929
01:20:36,270 --> 01:20:37,669
Tapes.

930
01:20:38,105 --> 01:20:41,040
Russell Bell, he loaned them to me.

931
01:20:41,375 --> 01:20:45,835
- That was considerate of him.
- What is it with you?

932
01:20:46,147 --> 01:20:47,671
At this time...

933
01:20:48,149 --> 01:20:52,279
- It's like you don't trust me anymore.
- What are you saying?

934
01:20:59,660 --> 01:21:03,323
I read that when a person does not...

935
01:21:04,231 --> 01:21:06,222
...trust another person...

936
01:21:07,368 --> 01:21:11,202
...it's because they, themselves...
- They themselves what?

937
01:21:13,140 --> 01:21:16,667
Are you turning this around
so it's about me?

938
01:21:17,211 --> 01:21:18,735
Is it, Nick?

939
01:21:21,582 --> 01:21:25,814
- Is this about you?
- What are you talking about?

940
01:21:29,924 --> 01:21:32,085
You look me in the eye...

941
01:21:34,228 --> 01:21:37,322
...and tell me you've
never cheated on me.

942
01:21:38,065 --> 01:21:39,828
Come on.

943
01:21:43,671 --> 01:21:45,263
You want me to...

944
01:22:05,092 --> 01:22:09,859
I'm gonna be sick. I'm gonna be...
I'm gonna be sick.

945
01:22:11,198 --> 01:22:13,393
This is not okay.

946
01:22:15,703 --> 01:22:17,295
You are an asshole!

947
01:22:17,538 --> 01:22:21,304
- Capital A-S-H...
- Stop hitting me!

948
01:22:21,542 --> 01:22:23,942
Asshole! O-L-E!

949
01:22:30,784 --> 01:22:35,050
The captain, here.
Shortly, we'll be descending.

950
01:22:35,289 --> 01:22:38,452
The cabin crew will complete...

951
01:22:38,759 --> 01:22:42,889
I know it's too early
to ask you to forgive me.

952
01:22:43,097 --> 01:22:48,262
But do you think you could someday
imagine starting to think about it?

953
01:22:48,469 --> 01:22:53,270
I just want you to know
that if the situation were reversed...

954
01:22:53,474 --> 01:22:57,843
...in my heart I'd forgive you.
- There's nothing to forgive.

955
01:22:58,078 --> 01:23:02,174
- What do you mean?
- Wanna know why? Because I did it too.

956
01:23:02,650 --> 01:23:06,780
Russell et moi. We did the deed.

957
01:23:06,987 --> 01:23:12,084
Le grand of freaky-frick.
We went all over the house.

958
01:23:12,293 --> 01:23:16,161
We went upside down.
We went sideways.

959
01:23:16,363 --> 01:23:19,093
We should have worn helmets.

960
01:23:26,473 --> 01:23:29,840
- What's going on?
- Didn't mean a thing.

961
01:23:30,044 --> 01:23:35,277
No, this plane. I called. The TRACON's
supposed to bring us straight in.

962
01:23:35,482 --> 01:23:39,885
We've been informed there's
traffic ahead at the airport.

963
01:23:40,154 --> 01:23:42,987
They've asked us to delay our landing.

964
01:23:43,724 --> 01:23:47,057
It shouldn't be long.
We'll keep you advised.

965
01:23:47,294 --> 01:23:50,821
Guess I get to spend quality time
with my husband.

966
01:23:59,206 --> 01:24:01,470
Who's on approach right now?

967
01:24:01,675 --> 01:24:04,735
The captain's turned
on the seat belt sign.

968
01:24:04,979 --> 01:24:08,710
We're experiencing a few bumps.
It'll be over soon.

969
01:24:14,388 --> 01:24:16,413
This is crazy.

970
01:24:16,924 --> 01:24:20,860
They don't even fit me anymore.
Where are you going?

971
01:24:21,428 --> 01:24:23,726
I need a drink of water.

972
01:24:28,335 --> 01:24:31,532
The "fasten seat belt" sign is on.
Sit down!

973
01:24:31,739 --> 01:24:36,574
- I'm with TRACON. Plane's in danger.
- Is that a threat?

974
01:24:36,777 --> 01:24:40,008
The man in control
is under emotional strain.

975
01:24:40,214 --> 01:24:44,810
- The captain's fine.
- You think the captain's in control?

976
01:24:45,019 --> 01:24:49,217
- Return to your seat.
- I need to talk to the captain.

977
01:24:49,423 --> 01:24:51,891
- Sir, sit down!
- Just 20 seconds.

978
01:24:52,126 --> 01:24:56,290
- Right now!
- Okay. All right. I will.

979
01:25:00,234 --> 01:25:04,193
- Captain!
- You are not allowed in there! Sir!

980
01:25:05,606 --> 01:25:09,770
- Return to your seat or...
- It's being put in bad...

981
01:25:09,977 --> 01:25:13,606
This plane's being put
in bad weather intentionally!

982
01:25:13,814 --> 01:25:16,282
The controller has lost his mind!

983
01:25:18,152 --> 01:25:21,485
- No water?
- They had sparkling. I want flat.

984
01:25:22,323 --> 01:25:24,416
You should've asked nicely.

985
01:25:24,625 --> 01:25:29,961
- I have to go to the washroom.
- You can't drink from the washroom!

986
01:25:30,164 --> 01:25:34,260
I'm going to ask the flight crew
to buckle in.

987
01:25:34,468 --> 01:25:36,060
A little turbulence.

988
01:25:43,844 --> 01:25:46,312
Captain! Listen to me!

989
01:25:46,513 --> 01:25:51,644
I have the proper identification!
I'm an air traffic controller!

990
01:25:51,852 --> 01:25:56,812
There's an unstable man
on the ground controlling this plane!

991
01:25:57,024 --> 01:25:59,322
I gotta talk to the captain!

992
01:25:59,526 --> 01:26:03,053
We've just been cleared to land.

993
01:26:03,263 --> 01:26:06,994
Will you please just give the man
a drink of water?

994
01:26:07,201 --> 01:26:09,362
- Sit down!
- I'll get it myself.

995
01:26:09,603 --> 01:26:13,630
Thank you for your patience.
Thanks for flying Dynajet.

996
01:26:25,686 --> 01:26:29,850
...we're looking at snow
at least until rush hour.

997
01:26:30,057 --> 01:26:33,117
The accumulation
is already five inches.

998
01:26:33,327 --> 01:26:36,194
I need an alternate route in tonight.

999
01:26:40,134 --> 01:26:44,696
Somebody on the scopes
is about to go on mental health leave.

1000
01:26:48,475 --> 01:26:53,879
Airport conditions: One inch
of hard-packed snow on all runways.

1001
01:26:54,081 --> 01:26:57,915
Runways cleared for three landings
before replowing.

1002
01:26:58,152 --> 01:27:02,213
Tower advises visual range
of 1/4 mile at 2000 feet...

1003
01:27:29,783 --> 01:27:31,216
Morton.

1004
01:27:34,621 --> 01:27:36,612
Repeat, please.

1005
01:27:37,724 --> 01:27:39,555
Who is this? How...?

1006
01:27:49,536 --> 01:27:51,231
Hey, Falzone.

1007
01:27:59,947 --> 01:28:03,542
Were you on approach last night
around 1:00 a.m.?

1008
01:28:08,622 --> 01:28:11,557
- What are you doing?
- Wrong answer?

1009
01:28:11,758 --> 01:28:13,419
- Nick!
- Knock it off!

1010
01:28:13,627 --> 01:28:16,528
- What are you doing?
- Nick, come on!

1011
01:28:16,730 --> 01:28:21,258
- Leo, we gotta talk!
- There's a bomb in the building.

1012
01:28:26,073 --> 01:28:27,267
- What?
- A what?

1013
01:28:27,474 --> 01:28:32,502
- We just got a call. There's a bomb.
- Well, that's a hoax.

1014
01:28:32,746 --> 01:28:36,910
- It came in on the secure line.
- I just wet myself.

1015
01:28:37,117 --> 01:28:38,141
That was me.

1016
01:28:38,418 --> 01:28:41,854
Take out this place,
and you close the whole sky.

1017
01:28:42,089 --> 01:28:45,286
The guy said it's good to go at 11:00.

1018
01:28:45,492 --> 01:28:48,359
- What do we do?
- We clear the building.

1019
01:28:48,595 --> 01:28:51,359
We're stopping all takeoffs.

1020
01:28:51,598 --> 01:28:54,624
Central Flow's holding
all incoming flights.

1021
01:28:55,269 --> 01:28:57,965
All we gotta do is land or reroute...

1022
01:28:58,171 --> 01:29:01,937
...every plane in our airspace
within the next...

1023
01:29:02,643 --> 01:29:04,270
...26 minutes.

1024
01:29:04,511 --> 01:29:08,538
Listen. I know I can't ask
any of you to stay...

1025
01:29:08,782 --> 01:29:13,014
...but I need two volunteers
to handle approach. We can do it.

1026
01:29:13,220 --> 01:29:14,278
It'll be fun.

1027
01:29:15,022 --> 01:29:19,220
These guys are coming in
with close to zero visibility.

1028
01:29:20,127 --> 01:29:24,291
The human body has a finite capacity
for handling stress.

1029
01:29:24,565 --> 01:29:28,467
I don't mind losing my health,
but I wanna keep my ass.

1030
01:29:28,669 --> 01:29:29,727
I'll stay.

1031
01:29:29,970 --> 01:29:31,062
- Good.
- I'll stay.

1032
01:29:31,305 --> 01:29:32,704
- Not him!
- Why not?

1033
01:29:32,906 --> 01:29:36,842
- We'll talk later. Let Barry do it!
- I'm fine.

1034
01:29:37,711 --> 01:29:41,477
- I like Russell's idea.
- Russell's on. Come on, clear.

1035
01:29:42,182 --> 01:29:44,673
Move away from the building.

1036
01:29:47,754 --> 01:29:50,188
Get behind the yellow tape.

1037
01:29:50,424 --> 01:29:52,483
Move away from the building.

1038
01:30:00,200 --> 01:30:01,997
Hold those people back!

1039
01:30:03,337 --> 01:30:06,864
Here's the bomb squad.
I'm gonna get some answers.

1040
01:30:07,107 --> 01:30:10,736
Sir, how many controllers
are in the building?

1041
01:30:10,944 --> 01:30:12,411
We got two.

1042
01:30:15,849 --> 01:30:19,216
Come on! You rolling? Okay.

1043
01:30:19,453 --> 01:30:22,513
There are two controllers...

1044
01:30:22,723 --> 01:30:25,055
...inside the threatened facility...

1045
01:30:25,459 --> 01:30:28,553
...who are frantically
and very courageously...

1046
01:30:28,762 --> 01:30:32,061
...guiding aloft planes to safety.

1047
01:30:32,265 --> 01:30:35,894
- Go to 4000.
- Turn right heading 330, speed 180.

1048
01:30:36,103 --> 01:30:39,869
Delta 2202, left heading 040.
Maintain 4000.

1049
01:30:40,073 --> 01:30:43,509
No. I can't take any more
unless fuel emergency.

1050
01:30:43,710 --> 01:30:48,306
Pull Delta. I can take it.
Northwest 2442, Newark altimeter 2891.

1051
01:30:48,582 --> 01:30:53,417
3861, traffic below at 4000.
What the fuck's wrong with you?

1052
01:30:53,620 --> 01:30:58,819
Eagle 49, proceed to outer marker,
ILS runway four. Fuck you, Russell!

1053
01:31:08,001 --> 01:31:11,664
- Turn, Northwest.
- He's in the turn. Go to two.

1054
01:31:11,905 --> 01:31:14,965
- What did I do?
- Save it for the hearing!

1055
01:31:18,578 --> 01:31:21,672
- You'll go down in flames!
- Kiss my ass!

1056
01:31:21,948 --> 01:31:23,609
United. That wasn't to you.

1057
01:31:27,654 --> 01:31:30,179
- What is it?
- Enjoy your last session!

1058
01:31:30,424 --> 01:31:33,484
- What?!
- Will you take that thing off?!

1059
01:31:33,694 --> 01:31:36,663
- Give me my feather!
- You can't have it.

1060
01:31:36,863 --> 01:31:39,195
1361, you're clear for approach.

1061
01:31:39,933 --> 01:31:42,197
- You don't need it!
- Give it to me!

1062
01:31:42,436 --> 01:31:45,769
- Your luck's run out!
- Why do you take my shit?

1063
01:31:46,006 --> 01:31:49,464
- You Riverdance motherfucker!
- Give me my feather!

1064
01:31:49,676 --> 01:31:52,543
It's mine. It's mine.
You can't have it.

1065
01:31:56,016 --> 01:32:00,112
- 2297 to 6000.
Here we go. 1077245...

1066
01:32:00,320 --> 01:32:03,153
- Shit!
- Jesus Christ!

1067
01:32:03,457 --> 01:32:05,891
Switch over to the main speaker.

1068
01:32:09,196 --> 01:32:12,461
Continental 2130,
137 miles from marker...

1069
01:32:34,421 --> 01:32:36,218
- I'm clear.
- Me too.

1070
01:32:37,424 --> 01:32:39,415
Gotta go! Now! Get out now!

1071
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:44,724
- Give me my feather!
- I don't want to talk about it!

1072
01:32:44,931 --> 01:32:47,331
Sparta Air 753 checking in.

1073
01:32:47,567 --> 01:32:50,559
Newark approach. Sparta 753.

1074
01:32:53,707 --> 01:32:56,733
Sparta 753 checking in.
Anybody there?

1075
01:32:58,712 --> 01:33:01,340
Sparta Air 753.

1076
01:33:01,748 --> 01:33:05,013
It's Jethro. Sparta 753, do you read?

1077
01:33:08,688 --> 01:33:12,954
753, this is Newark approach.
If you read, squawk ident.

1078
01:33:13,193 --> 01:33:17,129
- He'll miss the localizer.
- He's below minimum.

1079
01:33:17,364 --> 01:33:20,356
Sparta 753, this is Newark on 121.5.

1080
01:33:20,934 --> 01:33:25,268
Sparta 753, Newark approach.
Sparta 753?

1081
01:33:25,472 --> 01:33:29,067
753 has radio failure.
Can you plug me through?

1082
01:33:29,709 --> 01:33:33,645
Shit. How about company frequency?
Thanks anyway.

1083
01:33:34,381 --> 01:33:36,440
Communications are down.

1084
01:33:39,085 --> 01:33:40,313
What the...?

1085
01:33:40,754 --> 01:33:42,881
I'm gonna try the center.

1086
01:33:45,091 --> 01:33:49,050
Center, Sparta 753 descending.
Needs a turn and a climb.

1087
01:33:49,296 --> 01:33:54,290
We can't reach him. If you can get
to him, climb him to 2000. Thanks.

1088
01:33:57,337 --> 01:33:58,827
Godspeed, son.

1089
01:33:59,072 --> 01:34:02,769
753. I am not receiving.
Ya'll get fired again?

1090
01:34:14,120 --> 01:34:17,647
Come on, Nick! Get out of there!
Get out of there!

1091
01:34:17,858 --> 01:34:22,659
- Get down, Nick! Get down!
- It's gonna blow!

1092
01:34:33,106 --> 01:34:34,539
What the...?

1093
01:34:36,509 --> 01:34:38,500
Get him out of there!

1094
01:34:39,646 --> 01:34:41,443
Get out of here!

1095
01:34:43,283 --> 01:34:46,150
All right. All right. Where's Russell?

1096
01:34:46,353 --> 01:34:49,652
- He came out before I did!
- No, he didn't!

1097
01:34:49,856 --> 01:34:51,221
Operator, listen.

1098
01:34:51,524 --> 01:34:55,688
Connect me with Sparta Base
Operations in Greensboro.

1099
01:35:17,517 --> 01:35:19,576
The pilot?

1100
01:35:20,520 --> 01:35:23,353
Who shall I say is calling?

1101
01:35:29,763 --> 01:35:33,927
Sparta Air 753,
ILS runway four, left.

1102
01:35:45,712 --> 01:35:49,876
Everybody, get down! Stay down!
Get behind the vehicle.

1103
01:35:50,951 --> 01:35:52,748
Get back, people. Down.

1104
01:35:52,953 --> 01:35:56,354
- My God, he made it!
- Look, it's Russell!

1105
01:35:59,025 --> 01:36:02,552
Please! Stay back behind the line!

1106
01:36:14,040 --> 01:36:16,941
What happened? Are you okay?

1107
01:36:18,144 --> 01:36:21,944
After a search of the building,
no bomb was found.

1108
01:36:22,215 --> 01:36:23,978
The call was a hoax...

1109
01:36:24,217 --> 01:36:29,314
...that put many lives at risk
in the sky and in air traffic control.

1110
01:36:29,589 --> 01:36:32,387
While controllers ran
for their lives...

1111
01:36:32,592 --> 01:36:35,755
...one man guided
the pilots to safety.

1112
01:36:35,962 --> 01:36:40,422
Russell Bell, what made you stay
as time was running out?

1113
01:36:40,633 --> 01:36:41,657
It's my job.

1114
01:36:43,103 --> 01:36:47,301
While the identity of the hoax caller
is unknown, New York has identified...

1115
01:36:47,674 --> 01:36:49,141
Perfect. Perfect.

1116
01:36:53,346 --> 01:36:54,574
Come on.

1117
01:36:54,814 --> 01:36:56,145
Come on.

1118
01:36:57,751 --> 01:37:01,778
The kids and I are going
to Felicia's for a while.

1119
01:37:03,990 --> 01:37:09,428
- Come on, this is crazy.
- I left some casseroles in the fridge.

1120
01:37:09,829 --> 01:37:11,854
Put the suitcases away, okay?

1121
01:37:12,098 --> 01:37:14,157
- I've lost you.
- I'm here.

1122
01:37:14,367 --> 01:37:16,858
- This is not...
- I'm right here.

1123
01:37:17,103 --> 01:37:21,267
It's not all about the cheating, okay?

1124
01:37:22,675 --> 01:37:27,442
You know, I think that's
messed you up more than it has me.

1125
01:37:28,181 --> 01:37:32,117
- Put the suitcase down, sweetie.
- We used to be...

1126
01:37:32,352 --> 01:37:34,286
...so much in love, Nick.

1127
01:37:34,487 --> 01:37:38,719
And anything less than that,
it just feels like nothing.

1128
01:37:38,958 --> 01:37:42,689
- Do you understand?
- You're making a big mistake.

1129
01:37:42,896 --> 01:37:46,627
- Do you understand?
- No, and you don't either!

1130
01:37:47,333 --> 01:37:50,791
- Motherfuck...
- Why do I bother, you know?

1131
01:37:52,672 --> 01:37:54,537
You're gonna leave?!

1132
01:37:57,410 --> 01:38:01,369
Is there anything even
in those suitcases? Connie?

1133
01:38:01,648 --> 01:38:05,584
You know I'm gonna make this up
to you, don't you?

1134
01:38:08,221 --> 01:38:11,918
- You all work with Russell?
- I'm right there.

1135
01:38:12,525 --> 01:38:16,359
I said something good about you
but it got cut out.

1136
01:38:16,563 --> 01:38:20,226
- See the guy with the hat right there?
- Hey, sweetie.

1137
01:38:20,433 --> 01:38:22,663
I'll have a double tequila.

1138
01:38:24,003 --> 01:38:27,734
Russell's gone.
He took off with that crazy wife.

1139
01:38:27,941 --> 01:38:31,877
- Russell Bell is a hero.
I must say, I think he is.

1140
01:38:32,112 --> 01:38:34,842
We've tried to find out more about...

1141
01:38:51,731 --> 01:38:54,461
3451, turn left heading 060. Expedite!

1142
01:38:57,971 --> 01:38:59,598
Mother...!

1143
01:39:01,307 --> 01:39:05,038
- What's the matter?
- This TWA got in my airspace.

1144
01:39:05,245 --> 01:39:09,204
- He's got a data block.
- He was supposed to be at 5000.

1145
01:39:09,415 --> 01:39:11,713
- Tommy, sit down for Nick.
- Sure.

1146
01:39:11,918 --> 01:39:13,749
- Zone.
- I don't need him.

1147
01:39:13,953 --> 01:39:18,583
- Let's go have coffee.
- It had to be an operational error!

1148
01:39:18,791 --> 01:39:22,818
- You had a deal.
- Yesterday, he lands a zillion planes.

1149
01:39:23,062 --> 01:39:26,122
Today, he takes two
and almost crashes them.

1150
01:39:26,332 --> 01:39:30,735
I'm going to work. I had a deal.
So you've slapped my wrist.

1151
01:39:30,970 --> 01:39:35,930
- Do the paperwork and let me get back.
- Why don't you take today off?

1152
01:39:36,142 --> 01:39:40,476
- Go play with the wife.
- Just make sure it's your wife.

1153
01:39:42,582 --> 01:39:43,981
What?

1154
01:39:46,186 --> 01:39:48,586
- Who's ready?
- I am.

1155
01:39:52,358 --> 01:39:55,452
He's a go-around.
Landing gear not green.

1156
01:39:55,662 --> 01:39:59,189
Also, focus here on USAir 4844
and United 2417.

1157
01:40:14,447 --> 01:40:19,282
Nick, are you all right?
Are you on that? Are you on that?!

1158
01:40:20,620 --> 01:40:23,680
- USAir 4844, descend 3000.
- What's going on?

1159
01:40:23,890 --> 01:40:26,825
2417, turn right heading 120.
Correction.

1160
01:40:27,026 --> 01:40:31,520
2417, turn right heading 220.
Resequencing for runway 04, right.

1161
01:40:31,998 --> 01:40:36,025
- You want to pull the tapes?
- There's nothing to hear, so...

1162
01:40:36,502 --> 01:40:38,629
I want you to go home.

1163
01:40:40,807 --> 01:40:41,865
Home?

1164
01:40:42,075 --> 01:40:46,512
You get three deals in two years
and then I gotta yank you.

1165
01:40:47,647 --> 01:40:52,607
- Go home. You're dangerous right now.
- Just get some rest, Zone.

1166
01:40:52,819 --> 01:40:55,515
It's a slow day. We can handle it.

1167
01:40:58,258 --> 01:41:03,093
- I'll come back in the morning.
- Come back when you're ready.

1168
01:41:31,891 --> 01:41:34,883
- Front door's open.
- Hey, Barry.

1169
01:41:35,261 --> 01:41:39,357
- Place looks great.
- Come on, have a seat.

1170
01:41:42,035 --> 01:41:44,902
See? That's an endurance contest.

1171
01:41:45,104 --> 01:41:47,629
Straight knockout competition.

1172
01:41:47,907 --> 01:41:51,434
They burn themselves with the sand
and the cactus...

1173
01:41:51,644 --> 01:41:55,410
...and the magnifying glass
on the nipples. But, see...

1174
01:41:55,615 --> 01:42:01,053
...there's no order to the torture.
But that doesn't matter because...

1175
01:42:01,287 --> 01:42:06,088
...it's who's gonna fall first.
It's a point or a demerit system.

1176
01:42:06,292 --> 01:42:09,557
But it's... That's what...
What else can it be?

1177
01:42:11,731 --> 01:42:14,757
It's good you're taking time off.

1178
01:42:15,568 --> 01:42:19,561
You look great.
You were getting tense there.

1179
01:42:20,006 --> 01:42:23,339
And that day you kicked
Russell in the butt...

1180
01:42:25,144 --> 01:42:27,977
- We can laugh about it.
- Laugh at what?

1181
01:42:28,181 --> 01:42:31,639
- When you kicked him.
- He put me in a thunderstorm.

1182
01:42:31,851 --> 01:42:33,546
Is that what you think?

1183
01:42:33,753 --> 01:42:39,157
He had a medical emergency on ASR
approach. He had to spin seven planes.

1184
01:42:39,359 --> 01:42:43,125
The guy had a heart attack.
Russell got him down.

1185
01:42:43,329 --> 01:42:45,422
He did a hell of a job.

1186
01:42:53,106 --> 01:42:54,698
Leo, it's Nick.

1187
01:42:55,508 --> 01:43:00,207
Yeah. Great, great. Do you have
any idea where Russell went?

1188
01:43:01,714 --> 01:43:03,341
Where did he go?

1189
01:43:05,718 --> 01:43:09,484
Operator, I'm trying to trace
a friend in Colorado.

1190
01:43:09,689 --> 01:43:13,181
Mr. And Mrs. Russell Bell.
Yes, Bell.

1191
01:43:14,394 --> 01:43:18,854
Meadow Creek, Colorado.
No, I just need the address.

1192
01:43:49,896 --> 01:43:51,523
You caught one!

1193
01:44:06,012 --> 01:44:08,003
Let me take a look.

1194
01:44:08,214 --> 01:44:11,945
He's a big one.
You caught Moby Dick. Good work.

1195
01:44:13,853 --> 01:44:17,016
Why'd you let him go?
He wasn't big enough?

1196
01:44:17,223 --> 01:44:20,124
He knows I caught him, and so do I.

1197
01:44:21,694 --> 01:44:26,757
- Don't quit on my account.
- It's too cold anyway.

1198
01:44:27,700 --> 01:44:32,797
I called your house and Mary said
you'd be here. She sounds good.

1199
01:44:33,639 --> 01:44:38,406
She said to tell you, "See? I told you
Colorado wasn't far enough."

1200
01:44:38,644 --> 01:44:43,638
- That's what she said.
- What are you doing here?

1201
01:44:44,584 --> 01:44:47,815
Do I need a reason
to see my good buddy?

1202
01:44:54,727 --> 01:44:56,786
My life is shit.

1203
01:44:58,564 --> 01:45:03,058
Connie left me.
She's my high school sweetheart.

1204
01:45:03,402 --> 01:45:08,806
15 years, I never forgot an anniversary
or her birthday. Just wedding vows.

1205
01:45:09,008 --> 01:45:13,342
And I miss the hell out of her.

1206
01:45:13,579 --> 01:45:17,242
I had two deals in one day,
in a half-hour.

1207
01:45:17,850 --> 01:45:19,943
One more and I'm gone.

1208
01:45:20,753 --> 01:45:22,687
All the way gone.

1209
01:45:24,524 --> 01:45:28,085
I keep trying to figure
this thing out because...

1210
01:45:28,794 --> 01:45:33,128
...before you, I was "The Zone."
Everyone thought I was the best.

1211
01:45:33,332 --> 01:45:36,426
Including me, most of the time. And...

1212
01:45:37,603 --> 01:45:40,800
...I could always
keep my shit together.

1213
01:45:41,007 --> 01:45:44,534
You know, control things.
Stay in control.

1214
01:45:46,879 --> 01:45:48,779
And I've lost it.

1215
01:45:51,384 --> 01:45:54,820
I've lost the reality of my reality.

1216
01:45:59,158 --> 01:46:02,559
And I want my wife back.
I want me back.

1217
01:46:04,130 --> 01:46:06,690
I got me to blame for where I am.

1218
01:46:06,966 --> 01:46:08,524
Maybe not.

1219
01:46:10,703 --> 01:46:13,137
We both played this stupid game.

1220
01:46:14,807 --> 01:46:19,471
- It helped my marriage and hurt yours.
- That's true.

1221
01:46:19,679 --> 01:46:24,378
There is a way out, but you
can't think your way out of it.

1222
01:46:26,719 --> 01:46:28,983
Thought is your enemy.

1223
01:46:29,388 --> 01:46:32,846
I gotta think less.
I had that thought, actually.

1224
01:46:33,059 --> 01:46:35,027
You have to let go.

1225
01:46:36,095 --> 01:46:37,562
Let go?

1226
01:46:38,931 --> 01:46:41,195
- Let go of what?
- Let go of you.

1227
01:46:42,868 --> 01:46:46,736
- What have you done for you lately?
- I'm not following.

1228
01:46:46,939 --> 01:46:48,930
- Jump in.
- On the scopes?

1229
01:46:49,175 --> 01:46:51,075
No, in the water.

1230
01:46:55,114 --> 01:46:58,572
- The river?
- Yes, jump in the river.

1231
01:46:59,051 --> 01:47:01,576
It's too cold for the fish, right?

1232
01:47:01,787 --> 01:47:06,554
You're thinking. If you jumped in,
you'd be out by now.

1233
01:47:06,792 --> 01:47:09,886
- What's the point?
- Jump in the river.

1234
01:47:10,096 --> 01:47:11,393
Jump in the river!

1235
01:47:11,597 --> 01:47:14,566
- In the river?
- Jump in the goddamn river!

1236
01:47:14,767 --> 01:47:16,325
- I'm going in!
- Good!

1237
01:47:16,535 --> 01:47:17,866
- It's cold!
- Jump!

1238
01:47:18,104 --> 01:47:22,871
- What's this gotta do with my life?
- Cleanse yourself of your sins...

1239
01:47:23,075 --> 01:47:25,270
...and be born again!

1240
01:47:25,778 --> 01:47:27,803
That kind of thing.

1241
01:47:31,584 --> 01:47:34,052
Bullshit, man! Bullshit!

1242
01:47:34,587 --> 01:47:37,715
Bullshit, bullshit!
Bullshit!

1243
01:47:37,923 --> 01:47:41,324
I didn't come 2000 miles
for acute hypothermia...

1244
01:47:41,594 --> 01:47:45,997
...and some Sunday-school lesson
out of a fucking fortune cookie!

1245
01:47:46,265 --> 01:47:50,725
- Forget it!
- You want me to go in? I'll go in!

1246
01:47:51,303 --> 01:47:55,296
- It's too late.
- It's official! The results are in!

1247
01:47:55,574 --> 01:47:57,405
You're nuts, Riverdance!

1248
01:47:57,610 --> 01:48:02,604
I always suspected it, and now I know!
Why did you quit?

1249
01:48:03,649 --> 01:48:05,742
Doesn't seem your style.

1250
01:48:09,622 --> 01:48:13,183
I left because I was afraid
of one of two things:

1251
01:48:13,426 --> 01:48:17,419
Either I was gonna kill you
or a plane full of Japanese.

1252
01:48:20,766 --> 01:48:25,169
Well, at least I got to you.
You sure got to me.

1253
01:48:25,771 --> 01:48:27,432
Good luck, Bell.

1254
01:48:31,143 --> 01:48:33,509
You want your life back?

1255
01:48:35,781 --> 01:48:39,308
- Do you really want it back?
- What's it look like?

1256
01:48:40,619 --> 01:48:43,053
- Come on.
- Great. Fine.

1257
01:48:43,289 --> 01:48:45,655
Anything's better than that.

1258
01:48:48,994 --> 01:48:50,552
Where we going?

1259
01:48:52,398 --> 01:48:56,960
Let me put it this way.
You'll wish you'd jumped in the river.

1260
01:49:02,074 --> 01:49:07,068
All right. What do I do? Brace myself?
Should I relax? Lean in?

1261
01:49:07,313 --> 01:49:09,474
It's a 747 coming at you.

1262
01:49:09,715 --> 01:49:13,344
Clapping for Tinkerbell
won't make any difference.

1263
01:49:13,552 --> 01:49:17,682
- Don't you get it?
- To tightly hold on to sanity is insane.

1264
01:49:17,890 --> 01:49:19,380
What?

1265
01:49:20,092 --> 01:49:24,153
- To gain control, you gotta lose it.
- I can't hear you!

1266
01:49:52,591 --> 01:49:55,219
What was that you were saying?

1267
01:50:09,275 --> 01:50:10,867
Thank you.

1268
01:50:21,787 --> 01:50:24,085
Hey, how's it going, Zone?

1269
01:50:24,356 --> 01:50:27,416
Are you gonna stay for a while today?

1270
01:50:27,626 --> 01:50:31,153
Hey, that's very good news. Carry on.

1271
01:50:33,799 --> 01:50:35,494
He's here.

1272
01:50:35,968 --> 01:50:40,132
- Good to have you back.
- The rest did you some good.

1273
01:50:40,372 --> 01:50:42,499
- How are you?
- How you doing?

1274
01:50:42,708 --> 01:50:46,371
- Good to see you guys. You look good.
- You too, man.

1275
01:50:46,645 --> 01:50:48,442
What the fuck?

1276
01:50:48,948 --> 01:50:52,884
- What do you want to do?
- Where do you want me?

1277
01:50:53,152 --> 01:50:55,347
Where do you want to be?

1278
01:50:57,723 --> 01:50:59,691
Approach looks fun.

1279
01:51:00,559 --> 01:51:02,959
I'm impressed.

1280
01:51:03,162 --> 01:51:04,527
Kick some ass.

1281
01:51:04,730 --> 01:51:07,198
- Tear them up, Zone.
- Lock and load.

1282
01:51:08,801 --> 01:51:12,669
Canadian 1160, reduce to 180.
Traffic at your 11:00.

1283
01:51:12,872 --> 01:51:14,840
- Hey, Pete.
- Hey, Zone.

1284
01:51:15,074 --> 01:51:17,838
- What's cooking?
- You got three in trail.

1285
01:51:18,043 --> 01:51:20,204
The heavy needs a turn at 10.

1286
01:51:20,412 --> 01:51:24,314
And the overflow's closed,
so you got a full plate.

1287
01:51:51,510 --> 01:51:54,104
- One too many cups of coffee.
- Right.

1288
01:51:54,346 --> 01:51:57,543
- Sure.
- Stay with it. I know you can do it.

1289
01:52:07,760 --> 01:52:10,786
- What's my name?
- What are you talking about?

1290
01:52:11,030 --> 01:52:14,591
Come here. What's my name?

1291
01:52:15,467 --> 01:52:17,264
Come on.

1292
01:52:18,804 --> 01:52:21,637
- No Fly Zone.
- No Fly Zone.

1293
01:52:21,907 --> 01:52:24,740
Not bad. Where's your money?

1294
01:52:27,446 --> 01:52:30,813
- I had you getting to the headset.
- And then?

1295
01:52:33,252 --> 01:52:35,243
Anybody got me making it?

1296
01:52:37,790 --> 01:52:40,657
Nobody had me making it. Tina?

1297
01:52:41,827 --> 01:52:44,819
I was out 5 bucks
when you left your car.

1298
01:52:46,932 --> 01:52:48,297
Were you?

1299
01:52:49,301 --> 01:52:52,464
- I had you making it.
- Thanks, Ed.

1300
01:52:52,671 --> 01:52:54,798
I was the last one in.

1301
01:53:01,680 --> 01:53:03,648
Today's your payday.

1302
01:53:11,657 --> 01:53:14,091
Continental 2653, turn right.

1303
01:53:14,693 --> 01:53:18,459
Correction: Turn left...

1304
01:53:18,664 --> 01:53:21,997
...heading 28... Make that 260.

1305
01:53:23,469 --> 01:53:28,873
- Traffic's at 12... Make that 1:00.
- That's my boy!

1306
01:53:32,378 --> 01:53:34,437
Nick, I won!

1307
01:53:37,549 --> 01:53:41,280
American 393, welcome to my sky.

1308
01:53:41,487 --> 01:53:43,455
Descend and maintain 4000.

1309
01:53:45,024 --> 01:53:49,984
USAir 2994, turn right heading 010
to join the localizer.

1310
01:53:50,229 --> 01:53:53,062
No, with Felicia in Wisconsin.

1311
01:53:53,332 --> 01:53:56,324
But, you know, it's all behind me now.

1312
01:53:56,802 --> 01:53:59,202
I'm on my way back to New York...

1313
01:53:59,405 --> 01:54:03,239
...to pick up my things
and start my new life.

1314
01:54:03,475 --> 01:54:07,639
It's like I've been released
from prison. You know? I'm...

1315
01:54:07,880 --> 01:54:09,472
I'm free...

1316
01:54:10,349 --> 01:54:12,579
...and I'm independent...

1317
01:54:13,152 --> 01:54:16,144
...and I'm facing the future alone.

1318
01:54:16,355 --> 01:54:20,257
I have the kids. I'm exhilarated.
Tell me about you.

1319
01:54:22,494 --> 01:54:25,520
Steve and I are on our honeymoon.

1320
01:54:26,265 --> 01:54:28,324
- You are?
- Yes.

1321
01:54:28,534 --> 01:54:33,665
- That's fantastic. I'm...
- The captain would like to see you.

1322
01:54:33,906 --> 01:54:35,999
- He would?
- Yes.

1323
01:54:39,178 --> 01:54:40,372
Would you hold...?

1324
01:54:45,784 --> 01:54:48,048
Now, just take a seat.

1325
01:54:51,223 --> 01:54:56,251
We wanted you to hear this.
Control, could you repeat directions?

1326
01:54:56,462 --> 01:54:59,556
269, descend and maintain 3000,
heading 160...

1327
01:54:59,798 --> 01:55:02,790
...if Connie will have dinner with me.

1328
01:55:03,035 --> 01:55:04,730
Oh, jeez.

1329
01:55:05,637 --> 01:55:09,368
- Or you're 23rd in line for landing.
- What?

1330
01:55:10,909 --> 01:55:12,706
We gotta talk, Connie.

1331
01:55:14,379 --> 01:55:18,713
- Just press the button.
- I'm not gonna fight with you.

1332
01:55:18,917 --> 01:55:23,581
I wake up in an empty house,
and I hear you and the kids.

1333
01:55:23,789 --> 01:55:26,622
I know you're not there, but I hear you.

1334
01:55:26,825 --> 01:55:30,625
I can't work. I can't concentrate.
I can't sleep.

1335
01:55:30,829 --> 01:55:35,630
- I look at the scopes and see you.
- Could you confirm our heading?

1336
01:55:35,834 --> 01:55:38,894
Not until I finish.
Have dinner with me.

1337
01:55:39,104 --> 01:55:40,628
Nick, I'm not...

1338
01:55:42,274 --> 01:55:43,741
No.

1339
01:55:44,343 --> 01:55:46,834
Lunch at Enzo's, Thursday.

1340
01:55:47,112 --> 01:55:49,637
Come on, lunch at Enzo's.

1341
01:55:49,848 --> 01:55:51,645
Coffee?

1342
01:55:52,985 --> 01:55:54,418
I can't Thursday.

1343
01:55:55,087 --> 01:55:56,850
Friday?

1344
01:55:57,789 --> 01:56:01,850
- I don't know.
- "I don't know" is good. That's fine.

1345
01:56:02,594 --> 01:56:06,428
- I've never heard him talk like this.
- He needs you.

1346
01:56:07,166 --> 01:56:10,533
Please, just coffee? Give it a chance?

1347
01:56:26,218 --> 01:56:29,051
Return to me

1348
01:56:29,254 --> 01:56:32,246
Oh, my dear, I'm so lonely

1349
01:56:32,991 --> 01:56:36,427
Hurry back, hurry back, hurry back

1350
01:56:36,628 --> 01:56:40,223
Oh, my love, I am yours

1351
01:56:40,432 --> 01:56:45,563
Return to me
For my heart wants you only

1352
01:56:46,838 --> 01:56:49,102
Hurry home, hurry home

1353
01:56:49,308 --> 01:56:54,211
Won't you please hurry home
I am yours

1354
01:56:54,413 --> 01:56:58,907
My darling
If I hurt you I'm sorry

1355
01:56:59,084 --> 01:57:03,885
Forgive me
And please say you are mine

1356
01:57:08,193 --> 01:57:10,559
Ritorna me

1357
01:57:10,796 --> 01:57:15,392
Cara mia ti amo

1358
01:57:15,567 --> 01:57:18,001
Solo tu, solo tu

1359
01:57:18,203 --> 01:57:20,068
Solo tu

1360
01:57:20,272 --> 01:57:22,934
Mio cuore

1361
01:57:23,709 --> 01:57:25,904
Mio cuore

1362
01:57:29,348 --> 01:57:34,684
Thank you, captain. Runway 4 left
cleared ILS, contact tower 118.3.

1363
01:57:35,254 --> 01:57:38,883
Connie, I've been thinking
about this a lot.

1364
01:57:39,091 --> 01:57:41,753
My mind, it's like a broken computer.

1365
01:57:41,960 --> 01:57:44,929
- You take...
- Nick, would you quit talking?

1366
01:57:45,130 --> 01:57:46,791
What can you do?

1367
01:57:47,032 --> 01:57:50,866
- It takes a good beating...
- You're losing me.

1368
01:57:51,069 --> 01:57:55,563
- I think I'm ready.
- Nick, quit with the talking okay?

1369
01:57:55,774 --> 01:57:58,242
You're right. I know.
Okay.
