THAT, UM, YOU KNOW,
IT'S IMPORTANT

164
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:19,558
WHEN YOU HAVE A BAD BREAKUP

165
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,728

172
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:44,499
NO. I MEANT FRIENDS
LIKE DONNA OR... NOT ME.

173
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:48,044
BUT I NOTICED
YOU'RE ALONE A LOT,

174
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:50,880
AND I'M ALONE A LOT,
SO LET'S BE ALONE TOGETHER.

175
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:54,634
LOOK, WE'RE ALONE RIGHT NOW.

176
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:58,388
THAT'S NOT REALLY A VERY
GOOD REASON FOR US TO...

177
00:09:58,431 --> 00:09:59,973
WAIT.

178

BAD JACKIE!

254
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:17,397
BUT, HYDE, I THOUGHT WE AGREED

255
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:20,441
THAT YOU WERE ALONE
AND I WAS ALONE...

256
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:24,153
JACKIE, I'M TRYING TO HELP YOU

BUT WHAT IF I NEVER FIND
ANYBODY ELSE?

260
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:33,663
OH, YOU WILL, MAN.
YOU'LL FIND SOMEBODY GREAT.

261
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:38,251
YOU SEE, I, MYSELF,
DON'T LIKE YOU.

262
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:41,087
I FIND YOU ABRASIVE.

263
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:45,967
BUT IF I DIDN'T KNOW YOU
AND I HAD NEVER TALKED TO YOU,

264
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:49,095
I'D THINK YOU WERE TOTALLY HOT.

265
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:53,558

321
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:10,088
SO, THEN ERIC SAYS TO DONNA,

322
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,589
"I CANNOT GO OUT WITH YOU,

323
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:13,216
BECAUSE I'M GOING OUT
WITH THE GUYS."

324
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:16,803
OH, JEEZ.

325
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:20,014
WHAT? I DON'T THINK
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

326
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:23,851
NO. WHAT'S HIS NAME'S RIGHT.
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

327
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:26,270
LOOK, I DON'T THINK
I DID ANYTHING WRONG.

328
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:27,647
I'M NOT GOING TO
APOLOGIZE TO DONNA.

329
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:30,066
OH, YEAH?

330
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:33,402
WHAT? WHY?

331
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:34,821
HERE'S THE THING.

332
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:37,698
YOU'RE ASSUMING THAT YOU'RE
GOOD ENOUGH FOR DONNA.

333
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:40,326
AND YOU'RE NOT.

334
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:43,371
YES, I AM.

335
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:44,997
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

336
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,791
JUST LIKE I'M NOT
GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOUR MOTHER.

337
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:48,501
OKAY, WELL...

338
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:51,629
YEAH, THAT'S TRUE.

339
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:53,840
HEY, WATCH IT. I'M TRYING TO
HELP YOU OUT HERE.

340
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:55,424
I'M SORRY. YES, SIR.

341
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:57,009
LOOK, DO YOU REALLY
THINK I WANTED TO SPEND

342
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:58,845
THE WHOLE DAMN DAY
SITTING IN A ROOM

343
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:03,099
WITH A WOMAN WHO HATES THE
BUCKS AND SMELLS LIKE CABBAGE?

344
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,851
WELL, I DIDN'T.

345
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:07,728
BUT THAT'S THE PRICE
YOU PAY, SON.

346
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:11,149
NOW, YOU GO CALL DONNA
BEFORE SHE REALIZES

347
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:13,734
HOW MUCH BETTER OFF
SHE IS WITHOUT YOU.

348
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:17,155
GO ON NOW. GO!

349
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:20,575
GO! YOU HEARD HIM, GO!

350
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:22,535
BUT WHAT ABOUT...

351
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:25,580
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.
MAKE THE CALL, LITTLE MAN.

352
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:35,381
LISTEN, DONNA...

353
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:36,716
NO. WAIT.

354
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:39,468
I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT...
YOU KNOW...

355
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:41,304
WHAT HAPPENED.

356
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:44,390
AND I REALIZE
I MAY HAVE OVERREACTED.

357
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:46,225
IT'S JUST THAT I'M
A LITTLE VULNERABLE NOW

358
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:50,146
THAT OUR RELATIONSHIP
IS... MATURED.

359
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:55,109
DONNA, NO APOLOGY NECESSARY.

360
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:58,196
I WELCOME YOUR INSANE
BEHAVIOR AND CRITICISM.

361
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:04,368
DON'T BE A JERK, ERIC.

362
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:07,622
NO. NO. UH, AHEM, I'M
ACTUALLY... I'M BEING SERIOUS.

363
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,416
I'M WILLING TO DO...

364
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:13,377
WHATEVER IT TAKES
FOR US TO BE TOGETHER.

365
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:16,380
WHATEVER IT TAKES.

366
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:18,758
IT'S WORTH IT.

367
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:22,929
WELL... THANK YOU.

368
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:27,600
SO, UH, FOR FUTURE REFERENCE,

369
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:30,645
DO I HAVE TO ASK YOU,
UH, BEFORE I GO OUT

370
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:33,397
WITH MY FRIENDS?

371
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,483
NO.

372
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:40,029
UH... YES.

373
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:42,531
SOMETIMES.

374
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:46,744
SO, UH, HOW WILL I
KNOW WHICH TIMES?

375
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:49,956
WELL, YOU'LL KNOW AFTERWARDS
WHEN I GET MAD.

376
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:54,502
OKAY. YEAH.

377
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:56,754
UH, IS THERE, YOU KNOW,

378
00:20:56,797 --> 00:21:00,591
MAYBE A BETTER SYSTEM THAN THAT?

379
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:03,761
NO. I REALLY CAN'T
THINK OF ONE. NO.

380
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:06,973
OKAY, FAIR ENOUGH.

381
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:09,183
I'M REALLY SORRY.

382
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:11,644
ME, TOO.

383
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:14,772
SO, UH, I BLEW OFF
THE GUYS TONIGHT

384
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:16,399
TO HANG OUT WITH YOU.

385
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:18,567
SO MY CALENDAR IS WIDE OPEN.

386
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:22,488
I'M... I'M HERE FOR YOU, DONNA.

387
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:26,284
OH, THAT'S TOO BAD.
I'M HANGING OUT WITH JACKIE.

388
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:29,161
YOU COULD COME IF YOU WANT.

389
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:39,164
THAT'S REALLY NOT FUNNY.

390
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:43,884
SO, AUNT PE...

391
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:46,012
SHH!

392
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:49,598
CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY CARSEY-WERNER
PRODUCTIONS AND FOX BROADCASTING COMPANY

393
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:05,281
I WAS WONDERING...

394
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:07,742
SHH! OKAY.
