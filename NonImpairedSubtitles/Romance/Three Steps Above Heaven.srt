1
00:00:28,607 --> 00:00:29,801
One day it happens.

2
00:00:31,047 --> 00:00:32,844
You're standing somewhere

3
00:00:33,047 --> 00:00:36,357
and you realize you don't want
to be any of those around you.

4
00:00:44,447 --> 00:00:47,678
You don't want to be
the dickhead you just beat up.

5
00:00:55,407 --> 00:00:59,241
Your honor, I've got
15 stitches here and 25 here.

or your brother,

8
00:01:04,047 --> 00:01:05,878
or anyone
in yourfucking family.

9
00:01:14,887 --> 00:01:16,240
Son of a bitch!

10
00:01:20,847 --> 00:01:22,485

18
00:01:45,087 --> 00:01:46,645

You must be carefuI

There can be
no more vioIent incidents.

21
00:01:53,727 --> 00:01:56,685
Another offense
means you'II go to prison.

22
00:01:57,487 --> 00:01:59,125
Hugo, are you Iistening?

23

They've changed already.

00:04:11,007 --> 00:04:11,996
Dogface!

33
00:04:15,527 --> 00:04:16,676

No, she's outside.

00:05:37,167 --> 00:05:38,282
Absent.

53
00:05:39,807 --> 00:05:41,081
So,

54
00:05:42,087 --> 00:05:43,361
HerrerueIa.

Take your phone.

57
00:05:48,167 --> 00:05:50,761
Domu itinere

HerrerueIa...

63
00:06:20,887 --> 00:06:22,957
On the way home

A lot.

66
00:06:30,727 --> 00:06:34,003
You'II have to study a lot
to get into coIIege.

67
00:06:35,407 --> 00:06:36,442
CeII.

-It's OK.
-SiIence!

75
00:07:38,247 --> 00:07:41,398
Mara, doing it a few times
doesn't mean you're dating.

00:07:41,607 --> 00:07:44,644
So what? Anyway, his paIs

-GirIs, are you ready?
-Yes, mom.

If you want a Iift,

At Ieast 15.

But I am 15.

86
00:08:15,607 --> 00:08:16,722
Let's see.

87
00:08:20,847 --> 00:08:22,246

89
00:08:43,567 --> 00:08:44,602

-Don't worry about that now.

92
00:08:56,967 --> 00:08:58,082
Chino!

94
00:09:07,687 --> 00:09:09,279
Are you ready?

Don't act Iike you're desperateIy

00:09:36,487 --> 00:09:38,079
But I am.

105
00:09:40,367 --> 00:09:41,516
There he is!

106
00:09:41,727 --> 00:09:42,762

107
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:46,358

Shit, with aII that make-up

118
00:10:16,967 --> 00:10:20,721
I was at another party,
but it was fuII of gays.

119
00:10:20,927 --> 00:10:21,598
A real bore.

120
00:10:21,807 --> 00:10:24,367
Someone eIse who was bored
brought me here.

121
00:10:25,007 --> 00:10:27,123
That's him,
chasing Berta's brother.

122
00:10:30,647 --> 00:10:31,557

00:12:08,767 --> 00:12:11,361
-Can we go?
-Sure, I've got tickets!

145
00:12:12,567 --> 00:12:14,922
-Coming?
-Not to a rich kids' party.

146
00:12:28,167 --> 00:12:29,919
WiII you ever forgive me?

147
00:12:30,887 --> 00:12:34,880
I've been looking for a reason
to do it, but I can't find one.

148
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:36,281
TypicaI of a woman.

149
00:12:36,487 --> 00:12:39,081
See? That ''typicaI''
is what ruins everything.

150
00:12:41,287 --> 00:12:42,845
You're beautifuI tonight.

157
00:13:06,407 --> 00:13:07,806
Sis!

00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:22,925
Listen to the music!

160
00:13:24,047 --> 00:13:25,162

-Take it.
-I can't.

165
00:14:18,127 --> 00:14:19,321
Some idiot got it first.

166
00:14:22,247 --> 00:14:23,316
Here.

167
00:14:24,847 --> 00:14:28,283

169
00:14:31,647 --> 00:14:34,684
-But I'd teIl yours something.
-ReaIIy? What?

170
00:14:35,447 --> 00:14:38,007
You can't go around
with just 50 euros.

171
00:14:38,327 --> 00:14:39,601
That's my week's aIIowance.

172
00:14:39,807 --> 00:14:42,037
-lt was.
-Now I'II go hungry.

173
00:14:42,287 --> 00:14:44,676
If you want,
I'II buy you Iunch tomorrow.

174
00:14:46,247 --> 00:14:47,566
You know what?

175
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:50,685
When l'm paying,
I Iike to choose my company.

176
00:14:51,687 --> 00:14:53,006
-What's that?
-Never mind!

177
00:14:53,207 --> 00:14:55,038
Stop it! Stop!

178
00:14:57,207 --> 00:14:58,435
HoIy shit!

179
00:14:59,567 --> 00:15:01,956
Forget about Iunch.
What wouId we do after?

180
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:03,236
TeII jokes?

181
00:15:03,447 --> 00:15:08,202
Look, I wouIdn't Iaugh at yours
and you wouIdn't understand mine.

182
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:09,840
The jokes, I mean.

183
00:15:10,487 --> 00:15:11,602
HaIf-wit!

184
00:15:21,327 --> 00:15:24,046
If you dare take any aIcohoI
I'II teII mom.

185
00:15:24,247 --> 00:15:25,123
Excuse me?

186
00:15:25,327 --> 00:15:26,555
Don't you remember?

187
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,724
I accompanied you to schooI
this morning.

188
00:15:30,167 --> 00:15:32,078
Well, l was your escort.

189
00:15:32,287 --> 00:15:35,040
You were the one
shouting stupidities.

190
00:15:35,647 --> 00:15:39,162
No, I just said one.
''Dogface''.

191
00:15:39,407 --> 00:15:40,681
You Iiked it, right?

192
00:15:41,207 --> 00:15:42,879
lt always works
with girIs Iike you.

193
00:15:43,087 --> 00:15:43,997
Like me?

194
00:15:44,207 --> 00:15:45,925
Up-tight and keen to break out.

195
00:15:46,807 --> 00:15:48,126
Do you want something?

196
00:15:48,327 --> 00:15:49,885
A Coca-coIa, pIease.

197
00:15:50,487 --> 00:15:52,079
I have to drive.

198
00:15:52,927 --> 00:15:54,485
Babi?

199
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:56,166
No, l served myseIf.

200
00:15:56,967 --> 00:16:00,323
See? When you're pIeasant
you're not such a dogface.

201
00:16:00,527 --> 00:16:01,516
What?

202
00:16:10,407 --> 00:16:11,965
-Chico!
-PoIIo, take this.

203
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:17,162
No, put me down, you brute!
Let go of me!

204
00:16:25,687 --> 00:16:30,078
No, no! l'm sorry I threw
the miIk shake at you!

205
00:16:30,287 --> 00:16:32,960
The damage has been done.

206
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:51,446
You're out of your mind!

207
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:53,685
I'm wearing a VaIentino!

208
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:58,640
-It's freezing!
-It's good for the circuIation.

209
00:16:58,847 --> 00:17:00,917
It pumps more bIood
to your brain.

210
00:17:01,127 --> 00:17:04,403
You offer miIk shakes,
you don't throw them at peopIe.

211
00:17:05,287 --> 00:17:07,005
And teII VaIentino

212
00:17:07,607 --> 00:17:09,598
the dress Iooks a Iot better wet.

213
00:17:14,607 --> 00:17:15,835
The poIice, pIease.

214
00:17:16,047 --> 00:17:17,480
ShaII l get you a towel?

215
00:17:17,687 --> 00:17:19,279
You don't want to catch coId.

216
00:17:19,487 --> 00:17:20,840
Go to heII!

217
00:17:21,247 --> 00:17:22,521
Move, they rang the cops!

218
00:17:22,727 --> 00:17:23,796
Remind me

219
00:17:24,007 --> 00:17:27,158
the next time we bathe together
to wash your mouth with soap.

220
00:17:41,007 --> 00:17:43,475
Why did you do nothing
when he threw me in the pooI?

221
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:44,483
Babi,

222
00:17:44,727 --> 00:17:46,445
it was aII a set-up.

223
00:17:46,647 --> 00:17:49,525
I rang those idiots to cause
a fuss so I could be with you.

224
00:17:52,727 --> 00:17:54,638
Roberta wiII never forgive you.

225
00:17:54,847 --> 00:17:56,485
They wrecked the house.

226
00:17:57,647 --> 00:17:58,966
What the heII...?

227
00:18:02,207 --> 00:18:03,242
What are they doing?

228
00:18:04,567 --> 00:18:05,716
Go away!

229
00:18:06,807 --> 00:18:08,365
Stop it, pIease!

230
00:18:11,127 --> 00:18:12,765
This is my father's car!

231
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:14,082
Bastards!

232
00:18:18,007 --> 00:18:19,360
You want aggro?

233
00:18:42,087 --> 00:18:44,601
-You're fucking crazy!
-Go to heII!

234
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:49,555
Are you OK?

235
00:19:01,007 --> 00:19:02,122
Shit!

236
00:19:02,727 --> 00:19:03,762
It's nothing.

237
00:19:04,087 --> 00:19:05,440
Just some scratches.

238
00:19:05,647 --> 00:19:07,399
-They could have kiIIed us!
-It's aII right.

239
00:19:07,607 --> 00:19:09,040
There's stiII time.

240
00:19:10,007 --> 00:19:11,235
-I'm sorry!
-Sorry?

241
00:19:11,447 --> 00:19:12,960
For what? TeII me.

242
00:19:13,167 --> 00:19:15,681
For calling the poIice
or for the hit and run?

243
00:19:15,887 --> 00:19:16,763
You're so sexy.

244
00:19:16,967 --> 00:19:19,003
Leave him aIone, you animaI!

245
00:19:19,207 --> 00:19:22,597
You brute! Leave him alone!
You're despicabIe!

246
00:19:23,887 --> 00:19:25,286
You want to groveI?

247
00:19:25,487 --> 00:19:26,966
AII right, say after me:

248
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:29,158
-I wiII not ruin the party...
-Stop!

249
00:19:31,127 --> 00:19:33,925
l wiII not ruin the party

250
00:19:34,127 --> 00:19:36,277
for peopIe who know
how to have fun.

251
00:19:36,807 --> 00:19:38,525
I won't ruin the party...

252
00:19:38,727 --> 00:19:39,921
PIease, heIp me!

253
00:19:40,127 --> 00:19:42,277
...for people who know
how to have fun.

254
00:19:42,487 --> 00:19:44,045
-Mr. Santamaria!
-What's going on?

255
00:19:44,247 --> 00:19:46,442
They're going
to kiII each other!

256
00:19:46,647 --> 00:19:48,239
Boys, that's enough!

257
00:19:48,927 --> 00:19:51,680
Let's get out of here!
Babi, come with us!

258
00:19:52,807 --> 00:19:54,365
Fuck, it was your fauIt
that I hit him!

259
00:19:54,567 --> 00:19:55,920
You made me hit him!

260
00:19:56,887 --> 00:19:57,922
Get in the car!

261
00:19:58,127 --> 00:20:01,961
-I won't...
-I won't ruin... That's it.

262
00:20:02,927 --> 00:20:03,962
Leave him aIone!

263
00:20:04,727 --> 00:20:05,876
I hate you!

264
00:20:06,207 --> 00:20:08,960
You're an animaI, a brute!

265
00:20:09,167 --> 00:20:10,486
I hate you!

266
00:20:11,007 --> 00:20:12,281
Put me down!

267
00:20:13,287 --> 00:20:15,482
AII right,
I've put you down.

268
00:20:19,807 --> 00:20:21,035
And he's gone.

269
00:20:22,007 --> 00:20:23,201
I'lI say goodbye too.

270
00:20:28,127 --> 00:20:29,845
How do I get home?

271
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:45,005
-Let me get on the bike.
-What?

272
00:20:45,207 --> 00:20:46,765
Let me get on the bike.

273
00:20:47,807 --> 00:20:50,196
You said I'm an animaI
and a brute, right?

274
00:20:51,727 --> 00:20:54,161
I can't Iet someone Iike that
take you home.

275
00:20:54,887 --> 00:20:55,876
It's for your own good.

276
00:20:56,487 --> 00:20:58,637
Tomorrow you'd regret
not being consistent.

277
00:21:02,127 --> 00:21:03,526
Stop, pIease.

278
00:21:03,727 --> 00:21:04,921
Want to go somewhere?

279
00:21:05,127 --> 00:21:06,958
You want your face smashed?

280
00:21:07,167 --> 00:21:08,077
Scram.

281
00:21:08,287 --> 00:21:09,276
Scram!

282
00:21:16,447 --> 00:21:19,519
Get on, I've fought enough peopIe
because of you.

283
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,924
Wait, wait.

284
00:21:37,127 --> 00:21:38,276
I'm paraIyzed.

285
00:21:39,727 --> 00:21:41,046
You're squeezing me.

286
00:21:42,007 --> 00:21:43,963
If you grab my jacket
I can't drive.

287
00:21:45,167 --> 00:21:45,963
PIease...

288
00:22:09,887 --> 00:22:12,720
You want to stay Iike this
aII night?

289
00:22:12,927 --> 00:22:15,885
Sorry, I've never ridden
on the back of a bike.

290
00:22:16,607 --> 00:22:18,598
So I'm the first, right?

291
00:22:20,687 --> 00:22:21,756
Shit!

292
00:22:28,927 --> 00:22:30,042
Babi!

293
00:22:30,847 --> 00:22:32,963
-Did you come on that bike?
-No, mom...

294
00:22:33,167 --> 00:22:36,159
She had no choice, ma'am, reaIIy.

295
00:22:37,727 --> 00:22:39,763
The boy who was driving her
dumped her

296
00:22:40,247 --> 00:22:42,158
and she had to come with me.

297
00:22:44,807 --> 00:22:45,637
Hi, mom!

298
00:22:45,847 --> 00:22:48,680
Didn't I teII you
to stay with your sister!

299
00:22:48,887 --> 00:22:50,525
-HeIIo.
-Hi.

300
00:22:51,487 --> 00:22:52,522
Get in the car.

301
00:22:52,727 --> 00:22:55,719
You two won't have
any kind of phone for a week!

302
00:22:55,927 --> 00:22:58,395
You're exactIy Iike your mother.

303
00:22:59,207 --> 00:23:00,196
A grouch.

304
00:23:06,527 --> 00:23:08,563
Are you seeing that guy?

305
00:23:08,767 --> 00:23:10,086
I don't even know him.

306
00:23:10,407 --> 00:23:11,920
He's Hugo Olivera,

307
00:23:12,127 --> 00:23:13,355
but they caII him H.

308
00:23:13,567 --> 00:23:16,684
Something horribIe happened
and he wants to forget his name.

309
00:23:16,927 --> 00:23:19,316
My friends and I say
it's H for ''hero''.

310
00:23:20,207 --> 00:23:21,640
He Iooks Iike
he'd save your Iife.

311
00:23:26,967 --> 00:23:28,286
Who the heII Iet you in?

312
00:23:28,487 --> 00:23:31,320
-Get up, you've things to do!
-Yeah, for you!

313
00:23:33,967 --> 00:23:35,366
No, I understand.

314
00:23:35,687 --> 00:23:39,760
But I couId go to Paris next week
and we'II cIose the deaI.

315
00:23:41,327 --> 00:23:43,716
AIex, I need to borrow 400 euros.

316
00:23:44,127 --> 00:23:45,480
Fuck, what a drag.

317
00:23:45,687 --> 00:23:46,324
Wait.

318
00:23:46,527 --> 00:23:48,404
We'II taIk to Head Office.

319
00:23:48,607 --> 00:23:49,756
Yeah, sure.

320
00:23:50,447 --> 00:23:51,323
OK.

321
00:23:51,527 --> 00:23:53,882
What are you doing?
Give me that!

322
00:23:56,247 --> 00:23:57,043
Are you crazy?

323
00:23:57,247 --> 00:23:58,999
Don't give it to him!

324
00:23:59,207 --> 00:24:01,357
Don't speak! Don't speak!

325
00:24:01,567 --> 00:24:02,716
Yes, of course.

326
00:24:02,927 --> 00:24:04,918
In my waIIet, in my jacket.

327
00:24:11,207 --> 00:24:12,037
Yes!

328
00:24:12,327 --> 00:24:13,999
-No, of course.
-Thank you!

329
00:24:14,407 --> 00:24:17,001
ReaIIy, if he can't,
I'lI see to it.

330
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:19,715
Hugo, remember about dinner
with dad.

331
00:24:25,367 --> 00:24:26,766
Are you sure it's here?

332
00:24:26,967 --> 00:24:30,039
Yeah, I saw it in her diary,
and we're having Iunch.

333
00:24:30,487 --> 00:24:33,559
-You're broke.
-She said she'd pay.

334
00:24:34,607 --> 00:24:36,165
-HeIIo.
-Hi.

335
00:24:37,927 --> 00:24:38,916
That's her!

336
00:24:39,167 --> 00:24:40,646
-Which one?
-The bIonde.

337
00:24:40,847 --> 00:24:41,882
-Bye, Babi.
-Bye.

338
00:24:42,407 --> 00:24:44,796
And that's the girl
from the foam bath.

339
00:24:45,527 --> 00:24:46,676
I'm off.

340
00:24:46,887 --> 00:24:48,036
God, Babi!

341
00:24:48,247 --> 00:24:50,078
That's the guy
who stoIe my aIIowance.

342
00:24:50,287 --> 00:24:52,881
-Which one?
-The ugIy one beside the bike.

343
00:24:54,487 --> 00:24:55,556
Oh, no!

344
00:24:55,767 --> 00:24:56,916
Did he steaI from you too?

345
00:24:57,127 --> 00:25:00,483
No, but his paI threw me in the pooI
and wrecked Chico's car.

346
00:25:00,687 --> 00:25:03,360
You never teII me
the interesting things!

347
00:25:04,727 --> 00:25:05,716
HeIIo.

348
00:25:05,927 --> 00:25:07,485
What are you doing here?

349
00:25:07,687 --> 00:25:08,881
Hey, take it easy.

350
00:25:09,367 --> 00:25:13,076
I just came with my friend,
he's having Iunch with that girl.

351
00:25:13,287 --> 00:25:15,437
But she happens
to be my best friend

352
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:17,603
and your friend
stoIe aII her money.

353
00:25:19,567 --> 00:25:20,886
You owe me one.

354
00:25:21,167 --> 00:25:23,078
Why not invite me somewhere nice?

355
00:25:23,287 --> 00:25:24,640
What do you say?

356
00:25:24,847 --> 00:25:25,757
Moron!

357
00:25:25,967 --> 00:25:27,525
How sweet!

358
00:25:27,727 --> 00:25:29,001
Coming for Iunch?

359
00:25:29,207 --> 00:25:30,845
You can't have Iunch with him!

360
00:25:31,047 --> 00:25:33,561
But he's paying, so I'II get
some of my money back.

361
00:25:33,767 --> 00:25:35,405
I thought she was paying.

362
00:25:35,607 --> 00:25:37,120
l swiped her money yesterday

363
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:39,477
so it's Iike she was paying.

364
00:25:40,087 --> 00:25:40,997
Don't be angry.

365
00:25:42,047 --> 00:25:43,162
I'II call you Iater.

366
00:25:45,167 --> 00:25:46,202
Excuse me.

367
00:25:47,287 --> 00:25:49,323
Just to show I'm not a Iiar,

368
00:25:50,047 --> 00:25:52,720
didn't you and I have
a foam bath yesterday?

369
00:25:57,687 --> 00:25:59,245
That's a yes.

370
00:26:02,327 --> 00:26:03,919
-Hi, mom.
-HeIIo, Iove.

371
00:26:10,647 --> 00:26:12,763
Why is your brother so Iate?

372
00:26:13,887 --> 00:26:16,117
You know him,
he's aIways working.

373
00:26:18,727 --> 00:26:20,001
Where's mom?

374
00:26:21,687 --> 00:26:23,598
On a trip,
with a girI friend.

375
00:26:56,807 --> 00:26:58,798
What grade wilI you get?
8 or more?

376
00:26:59,007 --> 00:27:01,680
In Physics?
A distinction, definitely.

377
00:27:07,567 --> 00:27:10,161
I'm popping out.
Do you need anything?

378
00:27:10,367 --> 00:27:12,517
No, I'II take a break later.

379
00:27:13,927 --> 00:27:16,999
Wrap up weII if you go out.
It's freezing.

380
00:27:17,287 --> 00:27:18,561
Yes, mom.

381
00:27:31,847 --> 00:27:35,078
Rebeca, did your on
ever argue with that man before?

382
00:27:35,447 --> 00:27:37,722
l didn't even know
they knew each other.

383
00:27:38,167 --> 00:27:39,361
With his injurie,

384
00:27:39,567 --> 00:27:42,445
if we don't have some proof

385
00:27:42,927 --> 00:27:44,645
Hugo couId be in big trouble.

386
00:27:44,847 --> 00:27:46,883
Do you think
I don't want to help my son?

387
00:27:50,327 --> 00:27:51,237
Hugo,

388
00:27:52,447 --> 00:27:53,766
have you nothing to say?

389
00:27:54,327 --> 00:27:55,840
I'm moving in with you.

390
00:28:06,727 --> 00:28:08,683
Don't you want to know
how it went?

391
00:28:08,967 --> 00:28:10,116
How did it go?

392
00:28:10,327 --> 00:28:11,965
If you ask Iike that
I won't teII you.

393
00:28:12,167 --> 00:28:13,998
-AII right, don't.
-Babi!

394
00:28:17,687 --> 00:28:20,997
Excuse me, that bIonde hunk
was giving you the eye.

395
00:28:23,647 --> 00:28:25,877
He's stiII doing it.
ShaIl we follow him?

396
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:29,442
Why are you Iooking Iike that?

397
00:28:29,687 --> 00:28:32,360
You dumped me
and went off with that thug.

398
00:28:32,567 --> 00:28:34,364
Hey, you don't know him!

399
00:28:34,647 --> 00:28:36,160
He's got probIems.

400
00:28:36,487 --> 00:28:39,399
He's got no money.
His father treats him badIy.

401
00:28:39,647 --> 00:28:41,000
But he's reaIIy nice.

402
00:28:41,207 --> 00:28:43,198
He asked me
to the races tonight.

403
00:28:43,407 --> 00:28:43,998
What races?

404
00:28:44,207 --> 00:28:45,959
I toId mom
I'm sIeeping at your house.

405
00:28:46,167 --> 00:28:48,761
-Leave a key under the mat.
-l don't beIieve this!

406
00:28:48,967 --> 00:28:50,320
-Why don't you come?
-No!

407
00:28:50,527 --> 00:28:52,677
l don't want to see him
or his friend.

408
00:28:53,127 --> 00:28:55,766
Then we're not going
to see each other either.

409
00:28:55,967 --> 00:28:58,527
-Why not?
-I'm going out with him!

410
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:01,516
Katina!

411
00:29:03,927 --> 00:29:05,758
-Babi!
-Yes?

412
00:29:06,487 --> 00:29:07,556
Come here a moment.

413
00:29:07,767 --> 00:29:08,882
Coming.

414
00:29:13,847 --> 00:29:14,597
What?

415
00:29:17,887 --> 00:29:19,445
Haven't you something to teII us?

416
00:29:21,407 --> 00:29:23,079
The Santamarias rang.

417
00:29:23,287 --> 00:29:26,199
FeIipe's nasaI septum was broken,
it aImost pierced his brain!

418
00:29:26,407 --> 00:29:29,717
-I had nothing to do with it.
-It's true, she didn't.

419
00:29:30,087 --> 00:29:31,918
Who asked you?
Be quiet!

420
00:29:32,127 --> 00:29:33,526
Look, Babi,

421
00:29:33,727 --> 00:29:37,083
they want to report your friend.
They want to know his name.

422
00:29:37,287 --> 00:29:39,801
He's not my friend.
I just know he's caIIed H.

423
00:29:40,247 --> 00:29:43,284
Are you defending him?
How Iong have you known him?

424
00:29:43,487 --> 00:29:46,524
The onIy thing I know
is his nickname!

425
00:29:47,367 --> 00:29:49,164
You know his name, teII them!

426
00:29:49,487 --> 00:29:53,275
-Do you think I'm a teIItaIe?
-You toId me his name.

427
00:29:53,847 --> 00:29:55,166
DanieIa, his name.

428
00:29:58,047 --> 00:30:00,561
Hugo OIivera.
That's his name, dad.

429
00:30:01,687 --> 00:30:04,121
CaII them, and say
Babi had nothing to do with it.

430
00:30:05,247 --> 00:30:07,841
Great, Babi, you've reaIly
put your foot in it!

431
00:30:08,047 --> 00:30:08,923
DanieIa...

432
00:30:12,487 --> 00:30:14,000
My parents are out.

433
00:30:14,847 --> 00:30:15,962
Yes, she's here.

434
00:30:16,407 --> 00:30:20,195
But I reckon that in a week
she'II be dead.

435
00:30:20,407 --> 00:30:23,365
She informed on a dangerous guy,
and she Iikes him.

436
00:30:23,567 --> 00:30:25,842
Stop taIking about me
and hang up.

437
00:30:26,047 --> 00:30:27,958
Wait, I've got another caII.

438
00:30:29,007 --> 00:30:30,122
Yes?

439
00:30:31,647 --> 00:30:33,319
Yes, just a minute.

440
00:30:33,887 --> 00:30:35,036
It's for you.

441
00:30:36,967 --> 00:30:37,956
Yes?

442
00:30:39,887 --> 00:30:41,923
Good evening!
Yes.

443
00:30:43,287 --> 00:30:45,960
Katina? She's sIeeping.

444
00:30:46,687 --> 00:30:48,040
ShaII l wake her?

445
00:30:50,447 --> 00:30:52,517
Yes, l'll teII her.

446
00:30:52,727 --> 00:30:53,443
Good night.

447
00:30:54,047 --> 00:30:55,082
Bye.

448
00:30:56,407 --> 00:30:57,237
What's going on?

449
00:30:58,567 --> 00:31:00,523
What is it?
Who was that?

450
00:31:00,727 --> 00:31:01,955
It's turned off.

451
00:31:02,447 --> 00:31:04,085
Where are the bike races?

452
00:31:04,287 --> 00:31:06,357
The Siamese races?
At the port.

453
00:31:06,567 --> 00:31:08,444
-Can I go? PIease...
-No way.

454
00:31:08,647 --> 00:31:10,000
And don't teII anyone.

455
00:31:14,727 --> 00:31:15,796
Know where my sister's going?

456
00:31:32,647 --> 00:31:34,763
WE REMEMBERYOU

457
00:31:52,847 --> 00:31:54,246
No, stop, PoIIo!

458
00:32:00,607 --> 00:32:03,280
What a surprise!
I'm so gIad you've come!

459
00:32:03,487 --> 00:32:05,637
Why is your phone off?
Your mother rang.

460
00:32:05,847 --> 00:32:08,645
-What did you teII her?
-That you were asIeep,

461
00:32:08,847 --> 00:32:10,166
and she beIieved me.

462
00:32:10,367 --> 00:32:13,564
She's picking you up tomorrow
at 7:00 for your bIood tests.

463
00:32:13,767 --> 00:32:16,440
Don't be Iate,
I don't want any probIems.

464
00:32:16,647 --> 00:32:17,762
-Come on, stay!
-No!

465
00:32:17,967 --> 00:32:19,366
We're going for a pizza.

466
00:32:19,567 --> 00:32:21,478
I doubt I'd eat
the pizzas you eat.

467
00:32:21,687 --> 00:32:25,202
Well, it's the untamed shrew!

468
00:32:25,407 --> 00:32:27,284
Have you come to see me race?

469
00:32:28,047 --> 00:32:29,878
I didn't even know
you were here.

470
00:32:30,087 --> 00:32:32,123
Then why are you
red as a beetroot?

471
00:32:32,327 --> 00:32:33,601
You just make me laugh.

472
00:32:33,807 --> 00:32:34,922
-Yeah?
-Yes.

473
00:32:35,527 --> 00:32:37,563
You won't be so cocky in court.

474
00:32:38,127 --> 00:32:41,119
I said it was you who broke
Mr. Santamaria's nose.

475
00:32:41,327 --> 00:32:43,238
-You bitch!
-Take it easy.

476
00:32:45,127 --> 00:32:47,641
You could go to prison!

477
00:32:47,847 --> 00:32:50,122
That won't happen, OK?

478
00:32:53,567 --> 00:32:55,717
The day I'm up in court

479
00:32:55,967 --> 00:32:58,606
this nice girI wiII say
l did nothing. Know why?

480
00:32:59,447 --> 00:33:00,402
Why?

481
00:33:00,807 --> 00:33:04,800
By then you'II be so crazy about me
you'II do anything to save me.

482
00:33:06,887 --> 00:33:08,366
The race is starting!

483
00:33:10,047 --> 00:33:11,526
The race is starting!

484
00:33:13,047 --> 00:33:14,878
Want to ride behind me?

485
00:33:15,367 --> 00:33:16,686
Never.

486
00:33:18,887 --> 00:33:20,923
H, wiII you take me?

487
00:33:22,807 --> 00:33:23,637
Get on.

488
00:33:25,247 --> 00:33:26,999
Stop being scared
and you'II have fun.

489
00:33:28,047 --> 00:33:29,321
You don't even have a belt.

490
00:33:29,527 --> 00:33:32,644
This is just for Siamese.
So, race or fuck off.

491
00:33:32,847 --> 00:33:34,121
She's a reaI cow.

492
00:33:34,327 --> 00:33:36,921
-What did you say?
-l'm racing now.

493
00:33:37,287 --> 00:33:38,481
WeIl, then?

494
00:33:40,487 --> 00:33:41,715

495
00:33:42,127 --> 00:33:43,606

00:33:48,127 --> 00:33:49,355

Get on!

498
00:33:57,887 --> 00:33:59,479
Are you crazy?
Don't!

499
00:34:00,047 --> 00:34:01,958
I haven't got aII day.

500
00:34:10,927 --> 00:34:11,882
Good Iuck!

501
00:35:05,767 --> 00:35:07,200

00:35:50,767 --> 00:35:52,200

503
00:36:08,087 --> 00:36:09,600
Up! Up!

504
00:36:29,167 --> 00:36:30,486
Last Iap!

505
00:36:39,727 --> 00:36:40,921
Chino!

506
00:37:06,447 --> 00:37:07,323
Stop! Stop!

507
00:37:08,247 --> 00:37:09,202
Stop! Stop!

508
00:37:13,487 --> 00:37:14,442
Shit!

509
00:37:29,127 --> 00:37:31,197
Forget the bike, heIp her!

510
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:34,885
Don't move her!

511
00:37:35,087 --> 00:37:36,964
-Lift her up!
-CaII an ambuIance!

512
00:37:52,207 --> 00:37:53,879
Get on! Get on!

513
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:56,683
The cameras!
Cover the Iicense pIate!

514
00:38:04,527 --> 00:38:06,358
Hide here!

515
00:38:07,127 --> 00:38:09,322
I'II pick you up
once I shake them off.

516
00:38:09,527 --> 00:38:10,880
Quick!

517
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:19,440
Shit!

518
00:38:37,847 --> 00:38:38,996
I'm here.

519
00:38:39,207 --> 00:38:40,686
-Where?
-Here.

520
00:38:41,287 --> 00:38:43,039
Why are you in there?
Come out.

521
00:38:43,247 --> 00:38:45,124
There's a huge dog out there.

522
00:38:45,327 --> 00:38:46,726
There's no dog here.

523
00:38:47,247 --> 00:38:48,760
I stiII can't come out.

524
00:38:48,967 --> 00:38:50,116
Why?

525
00:38:50,407 --> 00:38:51,760
I'm embarrassed.

526
00:38:55,647 --> 00:38:57,478
Come out now or I'II Ieave.

527
00:38:57,727 --> 00:38:58,796
No, wait!

528
00:38:59,007 --> 00:39:00,122
Wait!

529
00:39:00,367 --> 00:39:01,197
What?

530
00:39:01,607 --> 00:39:03,563
Promise you won't Iaugh.

531
00:39:04,847 --> 00:39:05,996
I promise.

532
00:39:16,647 --> 00:39:18,126
What have you done, kid?

533
00:39:19,407 --> 00:39:21,796
-Are you covered in mud?
-It's manure.

534
00:39:22,287 --> 00:39:23,800
That's manure?

535
00:39:24,007 --> 00:39:27,317
I don't beIieve it!
This is too good to be true.

536
00:39:27,527 --> 00:39:30,166
I knew it.
Your promises are worthIess.

537
00:39:30,447 --> 00:39:33,917
-Wait, what are you doing?
-I'm getting on the bike!

538
00:39:34,167 --> 00:39:35,600
Are you crazy?

539
00:39:35,847 --> 00:39:37,519
You're covered in shit.

540
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:39,998
-You're joking, right?
-No.

541
00:39:44,087 --> 00:39:47,284
If you want,
you can wear my jacket.

542
00:39:48,047 --> 00:39:50,038
But first take off those clothes

543
00:39:50,247 --> 00:39:52,681
or you can't get on the bike.

544
00:39:54,607 --> 00:39:57,485
Fuck, this is disgusting!

545
00:39:58,007 --> 00:40:00,362
-Look, H...
-I Iike how that sounds.

546
00:40:00,567 --> 00:40:02,364
It's the first time
you've said my name.

547
00:40:03,447 --> 00:40:04,766
If you turn round

548
00:40:04,967 --> 00:40:07,606
I swear I'II jump on you
and cover you with manure.

549
00:40:07,847 --> 00:40:09,644
And I do keep my promises.

550
00:40:10,847 --> 00:40:11,882
Don't Iook!

551
00:40:12,087 --> 00:40:14,123
l've got no interest in Iooking.

552
00:40:18,047 --> 00:40:20,197
I'd appreciate it if you'd hurry.

553
00:40:24,647 --> 00:40:27,320
You're a fiIthy,
disgusting bastard!

554
00:40:27,527 --> 00:40:30,644
I didn't turn round, did I?
But you've got a great ass.

555
00:40:30,847 --> 00:40:33,156
I wish I'd rubbed the manure
in your face.

556
00:40:33,367 --> 00:40:35,244
Now I do hear a rabid dog.

557
00:40:35,447 --> 00:40:37,005
-Hurry up!
-Look!

558
00:40:37,687 --> 00:40:40,326
Lift your legs
or he'Il bite you!

559
00:41:20,887 --> 00:41:22,286
Thank you for the Iift.

560
00:41:24,047 --> 00:41:26,003
So I'II pick you up tomorrow.

561
00:41:26,207 --> 00:41:27,481
What time?

562
00:41:27,767 --> 00:41:29,962
Sure, and the poIice
can chase us again.

563
00:41:30,167 --> 00:41:31,282
Right.

564
00:42:04,847 --> 00:42:07,042
You were a very brave Siamese.

565
00:42:08,287 --> 00:42:09,959
Are you going to report me?

566
00:42:10,567 --> 00:42:11,158
-Yes.
-Yes?

567
00:42:12,287 --> 00:42:14,721
ReaIIy?
Do you swear?

568
00:42:33,247 --> 00:42:35,078
Oh, Babi, Babi!

569
00:42:35,407 --> 00:42:37,796
I'm a pig, an animaI, a beast,

570
00:42:38,007 --> 00:42:39,520
but you'd let me kiss you.

571
00:42:39,727 --> 00:42:41,604
-You're inconsistent.
-And you're a bastard!

572
00:42:41,807 --> 00:42:45,083
You had your mouth open,
begging me to kiss you.

573
00:42:46,367 --> 00:42:48,961
Give me back my jacket right now.

574
00:42:51,127 --> 00:42:52,116
HotIips,

575
00:42:52,567 --> 00:42:54,205
what about a good night kiss?

576
00:42:54,407 --> 00:42:55,760
Go to heII!

577
00:43:11,367 --> 00:43:13,005
I was really worried.

578
00:43:13,207 --> 00:43:15,801
Your mom thought l was you
and gave me a good night kiss.

579
00:43:16,007 --> 00:43:17,998
-What happened?
-It was H, wasn't it?

580
00:43:18,567 --> 00:43:20,125
He tore off your cIothes.

581
00:43:20,607 --> 00:43:21,642
You'II wake mom.

582
00:43:21,847 --> 00:43:22,802

583
00:43:24,847 --> 00:43:25,996

584
00:43:27,847 --> 00:43:29,360
She smeIls of shit.

585
00:43:37,727 --> 00:43:39,718
Sorry, the poIice were after me.

586
00:43:40,287 --> 00:43:43,518
Liar, I saw you go off

Throw it up to me!

589
00:44:17,087 --> 00:44:18,076
Come on!

590
00:44:31,567 --> 00:44:33,444
She raced as a Siamese

591
00:44:33,647 --> 00:44:35,478
and saved a girI
who had an accident.

592
00:44:35,687 --> 00:44:36,836
It's realIy wild.

593
00:44:37,047 --> 00:44:38,765
-Are you going out?
-No!

594
00:44:39,967 --> 00:44:41,002
Sure.

595
00:44:45,887 --> 00:44:48,355
Katina, not again.
I'm not going out.

596
00:44:51,807 --> 00:44:53,286
Look who's waiting for you

597
00:45:16,767 --> 00:45:19,406
Babi! You're seeing H,
aren't you?

598
00:45:20,127 --> 00:45:22,721
If mom and dad ask,
I'm studying at Katina's.

599
00:45:22,927 --> 00:45:23,996
OK.

600

601
00:45:27,687 --> 00:45:29,166
I'm the hero's sister-in-Iaw.

602
00:45:46,687 --> 00:45:47,676
H...

603
00:45:48,287 --> 00:45:49,481
Got a Iight?

604
00:45:54,687 --> 00:45:55,722
What's up?

605
00:45:55,927 --> 00:45:57,280
New projects.

606
00:45:57,767 --> 00:46:02,045
Good Iuck, I don't think that prude
wiII open her Iegs so easiIy.

607
00:46:05,687 --> 00:46:07,006
I'll caII you, OK?

608
00:46:29,007 --> 00:46:30,235

609
00:48:21,047 --> 00:48:22,275
Dogface.

610
00:48:23,847 --> 00:48:24,836
Brute.

611
00:49:10,767 --> 00:49:12,086
Mom, why are you stiII up?

612
00:49:15,887 --> 00:49:19,402
Why are you behaving
as if you weren't my daughter?

613
00:49:19,687 --> 00:49:20,802
It got Iate.

614
00:49:21,007 --> 00:49:22,235
Come here!

615
00:49:35,807 --> 00:49:38,719
-Were you drinking?
-You know I don't drink.

616
00:49:40,567 --> 00:49:42,762
What's that boy doing to you?

617
00:49:42,967 --> 00:49:46,960
-Is he making you do anything?
-Nothing I don't want to do.

618
00:49:50,127 --> 00:49:51,196
Is anything wrong?

619
00:49:55,287 --> 00:49:57,562
No, dad, I came home Iate,
that's aII.

620
00:50:03,447 --> 00:50:05,358
I got his Iicense pIate.

621
00:50:05,567 --> 00:50:07,444
-TaIk to him.
-They're just kids.

622
00:50:07,647 --> 00:50:10,081

00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:26,317
Is that you?

625
00:50:29,327 --> 00:50:30,396

l got caught coming home late.

627
00:50:40,367 --> 00:50:42,005
So it's not an urban Iegend.

628
00:50:43,167 --> 00:50:44,885
Nice girIs who behave badIy

629
00:50:45,087 --> 00:50:46,486
are till grounded.

630
00:50:48,767 --> 00:50:50,041
What'll we do tomorrow?

631
00:50:51,247 --> 00:50:52,396
Go off somewhere.

632
00:50:55,727 --> 00:50:58,241
Pick me up at the schooI gate
and take me away.

633
00:50:58,647 --> 00:51:00,444

634
00:51:00,647 --> 00:51:01,796

635
00:51:02,007 --> 00:51:03,122
I might sleep in.

636
00:51:06,087 --> 00:51:07,486
I trust you, H.

637
00:51:08,847 --> 00:51:10,075

-Bye, Babi.

00:51:31,607 --> 00:51:33,245
Let's go inside.

641
00:51:33,567 --> 00:51:35,239
I can't. H is coming.

642
00:51:35,447 --> 00:51:37,039
-We're going off!
-What?

643
00:51:37,247 --> 00:51:38,726
You're going to screw!

644

As your best friend,

No, I'm reaIIy excited.

647
00:51:45,367 --> 00:51:47,676
lt's Iike I was
losing my virginity again.

648
00:51:50,327 --> 00:51:52,682
-There he is! Wish me Iuck.
-Lots of Iuck.

649
00:51:58,287 --> 00:52:00,357

Hugo, pIease.

654
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:41,886
Hugo, stop, pIease!

655
00:52:43,927 --> 00:52:45,360
H, what is it?

656
00:52:45,567 --> 00:52:48,161
Hugo, please, don't!

657
00:53:00,607 --> 00:53:02,199
In physics?
A distinction, definitely.

658
00:53:03,487 --> 00:53:05,921
I'm popping out.
Do you need anything?

659
00:53:06,767 --> 00:53:08,200
No, I'II take a break later.

660
00:53:29,887 --> 00:53:31,559
Son of a bitch!

661
00:53:41,967 --> 00:53:42,638
Stop!

662
00:53:44,687 --> 00:53:45,324
PIease, Hugo!

663
00:53:46,487 --> 00:53:47,283
PIease, stop!

664
00:53:47,487 --> 00:53:48,556
H, pIease!

665
00:53:50,767 --> 00:53:51,802
Stop, Hugo!

666
00:53:52,967 --> 00:53:53,922
Stop!

667
00:53:57,647 --> 00:53:58,636
Are you crazy?

668
00:53:58,847 --> 00:54:00,405
You couId have kiIIed us!

669
00:54:00,647 --> 00:54:01,762
Stop!

670
00:54:09,007 --> 00:54:09,883
Stop!

671
00:54:10,407 --> 00:54:11,442
Stop!

672
00:54:12,927 --> 00:54:13,837
Stop, pIease!

673
00:54:14,047 --> 00:54:15,719
H! Stop, stop!

674
00:54:37,087 --> 00:54:38,406
Who was that woman?

675
00:54:43,447 --> 00:54:44,800
She was my mother.

676
00:55:01,007 --> 00:55:03,919
Your father and your brother
don't know?

677
00:55:05,367 --> 00:55:07,278
My father thinks
she's with her friends.

678
00:55:12,807 --> 00:55:14,559
Am l the onIy one who knows?

679
00:56:13,447 --> 00:56:14,596
Stop, stop!

680
00:56:16,287 --> 00:56:17,322
Why?

681
00:56:18,767 --> 00:56:20,359
We're out in the open.

682
00:56:22,847 --> 00:56:24,565
There's no one here.

683
00:56:37,887 --> 00:56:39,559
I said no.

684
00:56:43,447 --> 00:56:44,596
OK.

685
00:56:48,367 --> 00:56:49,595
Come here.

686
00:56:49,807 --> 00:56:50,762
Come on.

687
00:58:17,247 --> 00:58:18,999
Why did you bring me here?

688
00:58:19,207 --> 00:58:20,276
Don't you Iike it?

689
00:58:20,967 --> 00:58:24,596
My parents always brought us here
when we were littIe.

690
00:58:25,487 --> 00:58:27,478
See the house that's for saIe?

691
00:58:27,687 --> 00:58:28,278
Yes.

692
00:58:29,607 --> 00:58:31,643
My sister and I
pretended it was ours.

693
00:58:31,847 --> 00:58:35,601
We used to see the owners
and we imagined we were them.

694
00:58:39,367 --> 00:58:40,482
It's so sad.

695
00:58:47,567 --> 00:58:49,876
It's Iike we can
never enjoy it again.

696
00:58:52,567 --> 00:58:53,966
I knew you'd Iike it.

697
00:59:04,567 --> 00:59:06,046
The jacket suits you.

698
00:59:09,727 --> 00:59:11,285
Who's caIling?

699
00:59:13,527 --> 00:59:15,882
My mother doesn't trust me.

700
00:59:18,007 --> 00:59:19,122
Or rather, you.

701
00:59:56,367 --> 00:59:58,039
Is that like mom's signature?

702
00:59:59,087 --> 01:00:00,679
I think it's perfect.

703
01:00:00,887 --> 01:00:02,764
-Thank you for helping me.
-Not at aII.

704
01:00:02,967 --> 01:00:05,162
Don't go yet,
come and meet my daughters.

705
01:00:05,727 --> 01:00:06,716
GirIs,

706
01:00:09,287 --> 01:00:11,596
this is Gustavo,
our new upstairs neighbor.

707
01:00:11,807 --> 01:00:14,275
-Yes, we've seen each other.
-Yes.

708
01:00:14,487 --> 01:00:18,366
He doesn't know anyone,
l said you could take him out

709
01:00:18,567 --> 01:00:19,920
and introduce him.

710
01:00:20,127 --> 01:00:21,606
Yes, mom, but not tonight.

711
01:00:21,807 --> 01:00:24,446
The girIs have asked me
to go to the cinema

712
01:00:24,727 --> 01:00:27,116
and as I'm not grounded anymore
I can go, can't I?

713
01:00:29,727 --> 01:00:31,365
I have to go.
My pIeasure.

714
01:00:31,567 --> 01:00:32,716
Likewise.

715
01:00:33,607 --> 01:00:34,835
Ciao.

716
01:00:36,407 --> 01:00:38,284
This weekend, if I can,
I'lI caII him.

717
01:00:43,407 --> 01:00:47,241
That hunk is walking
into the Iion's den.

718
01:01:41,687 --> 01:01:42,881
You, ''HeIlo, Kitty''.

719
01:01:43,687 --> 01:01:44,915
This is yours, right?

720
01:01:45,127 --> 01:01:46,845
You wouIdn't have
such good taste.

721
01:01:47,087 --> 01:01:49,555
The other night, H used it
to tie me to the bed.

722
01:01:51,087 --> 01:01:51,963
lt's strong.

723
01:01:52,167 --> 01:01:53,600
Not strong enough
if you're here.

724
01:01:53,807 --> 01:01:54,796
Poor thing.

725
01:01:55,007 --> 01:01:57,601
You thought he'd promise you
eternaI Iove, eh?

726
01:01:59,527 --> 01:02:00,960
I feeI sorry for you.

727
01:02:01,407 --> 01:02:03,363
It's obvious
you're crazy about him.

728
01:02:05,727 --> 01:02:07,797
Give me the scarf!
Give it to me!

729
01:02:08,007 --> 01:02:09,156
-Let go!
-Give it to me!

730
01:02:09,367 --> 01:02:10,686
-Get off!
-Let go of me!

731
01:02:10,887 --> 01:02:12,161
-Stop it!
-Give me the scarf!

732
01:02:12,367 --> 01:02:13,846
Let go, you bitch!

733
01:02:17,487 --> 01:02:18,442
Hit her, Babi!

734
01:02:25,127 --> 01:02:26,799
Hit her, Babi, go on!

735
01:02:28,247 --> 01:02:30,363
Hit her harder!

736
01:02:37,567 --> 01:02:38,556
H!

737
01:02:39,327 --> 01:02:40,555
Shit, it's Babi!

738
01:02:48,407 --> 01:02:50,159
Let go of me!

739
01:02:53,487 --> 01:02:55,842
The next time, l'll kiII you,
you whore!

740
01:03:09,367 --> 01:03:11,323
I don't know what happened me.

741
01:03:12,327 --> 01:03:13,646
l didn't want to hurt her.

742
01:03:15,567 --> 01:03:18,206
-She said you'd been with her...
-Babi, Babi...

743
01:03:21,487 --> 01:03:23,398
I won't cheat on you
or hurt you.

744
01:03:24,527 --> 01:03:25,721
I'm with you now.

745
01:03:28,087 --> 01:03:31,443
With the girI who'll beat up
anyone who insuIts her guy.

746
01:03:35,607 --> 01:03:39,600
You know what warriors do
after their first victory in battIe?

747
01:04:35,447 --> 01:04:36,402
Hugo...

748
01:04:38,167 --> 01:04:39,919
Someone wants a word with you.

749
01:04:42,047 --> 01:04:44,880
I'm CIaudio AIcazar,
Babi's father.

750
01:04:46,887 --> 01:04:49,845
-ShaII we go down for a drink?
-Yes, of course.

751
01:04:51,047 --> 01:04:51,763
Hugo,

752
01:04:52,447 --> 01:04:54,085
we have to taIk.

753
01:04:58,647 --> 01:05:01,036
-H, won't you introduce me?
-Of course.

754
01:05:02,207 --> 01:05:03,117
Rosanna, CIaudio.

755
01:05:03,407 --> 01:05:04,078
CIaudio, Rosanna.

756
01:05:04,287 --> 01:05:05,879
-My pIeasure.
-Likewise.

757
01:05:07,847 --> 01:05:10,315
Sweetheart,
you want oIives or nuts?

758
01:05:11,447 --> 01:05:12,721
OIives.

759
01:05:15,527 --> 01:05:16,926
She Iiked you.

760
01:05:17,127 --> 01:05:18,685
She doesn't offer nuts
to everyone.

761
01:05:18,887 --> 01:05:20,605
-No?
-No.

762
01:05:22,407 --> 01:05:24,875
I don't reaIIy know
where to begin.

763
01:05:25,367 --> 01:05:26,197
You see,

764
01:05:26,767 --> 01:05:27,756
my wife...

765
01:05:27,967 --> 01:05:31,596
OIives for the best Iooking man
to come in here this year.

766
01:05:32,927 --> 01:05:33,803
Married, of course.

767
01:05:38,287 --> 01:05:39,242
CIaudio,

768
01:05:41,087 --> 01:05:44,124
I understand
that your wife is concerned.

769
01:05:45,407 --> 01:05:47,762
Her daughter is with a guy
who rides a motorbike,

770
01:05:47,967 --> 01:05:49,878
racing around at 100 m.p.h.

771
01:05:50,487 --> 01:05:52,717
because I don't want
to see things.

772
01:05:54,567 --> 01:05:56,000
But suddenly

773
01:05:56,607 --> 01:05:58,837
someone appears and says
''CaIm down'',

774
01:05:59,647 --> 01:06:00,716
''ease up''.

775
01:06:01,847 --> 01:06:04,998
And when you ease up
you become aware of things.

776
01:06:06,487 --> 01:06:10,196
That there's a dance trophy
among the bottIes of tequiIa.

777
01:06:10,807 --> 01:06:13,082
That my favorite song is playing.

778
01:06:13,607 --> 01:06:15,040
That today is Tuesday 13th.

779
01:06:15,327 --> 01:06:18,922
And that Rosanna would run away
with you right now

780
01:06:19,127 --> 01:06:20,560
to the ends of the earth.

781
01:06:21,327 --> 01:06:22,760
LittIe things, CIaudio.

782
01:06:24,207 --> 01:06:25,686
Your daughter is easing me up.

783
01:06:29,607 --> 01:06:30,881
And that's good for me.

784
01:06:38,727 --> 01:06:39,762
Not now, AIex.

785
01:06:39,967 --> 01:06:43,084
What wrong with you? Didn't you
understand about prison?

786
01:06:43,287 --> 01:06:46,484
You can't just do as you wish.
I'm sick of being your nursemaid!

787
01:06:46,727 --> 01:06:49,287
Stop messing around
and behave Iike an aduIt!

788
01:06:51,687 --> 01:06:53,325
And what's that?

789
01:06:53,527 --> 01:06:57,315
Being oId at 30 and not knowing
how to enjoy Iife? TeIl me!

790
01:07:04,247 --> 01:07:05,236
l'm sorry.

791
01:07:15,767 --> 01:07:17,598
-Maria AveIIan.
-Present.

792
01:07:18,127 --> 01:07:20,118
-Babi AIcazar.
-Present.

793
01:07:20,807 --> 01:07:22,160
lrene Catur...

794
01:07:23,727 --> 01:07:24,921
Here you are.

795
01:07:26,487 --> 01:07:27,806
Miss AIcazar!

796
01:07:28,847 --> 01:07:30,485
Did your mother sign this?

797
01:07:30,847 --> 01:07:31,916
Yes.

798
01:07:32,447 --> 01:07:33,800
It's odd.

799
01:07:34,367 --> 01:07:37,598
I've just spoken to her
and she didn't know you were ilI.

800
01:07:39,287 --> 01:07:41,801
Nor that you were absent
on Friday.

801
01:07:43,207 --> 01:07:44,401
She's on her way.

802
01:07:45,247 --> 01:07:47,477
You know that what you've done

803
01:07:47,687 --> 01:07:50,406
means immediate expuIsion
from this schooI?

804
01:07:53,967 --> 01:07:56,401
-Did they expeI me, mom?
-No,

805
01:07:56,607 --> 01:07:59,804
because we've donated 8,000 euros
to the schooI.

806
01:08:00,007 --> 01:08:02,441
-Mom, I promise...
-Be quiet, pIease!

807
01:08:02,647 --> 01:08:04,638
Stop making a fooI of me.

808
01:08:04,847 --> 01:08:06,758
When did you decide
to Iaugh at me?

809
01:08:07,007 --> 01:08:09,077
l don't know you, Babi.

810
01:08:09,447 --> 01:08:11,677
-Babi, what's wrong?
-Stay away, Katina.

811
01:08:11,887 --> 01:08:13,240
And don't caII!

812
01:08:13,487 --> 01:08:14,840
She's in on it too, isn't she?

813
01:08:15,047 --> 01:08:17,607
It's time you stopped seeing her.

814
01:08:29,807 --> 01:08:31,718
Katina aid the teacher
is screwing you around.

815
01:08:32,247 --> 01:08:33,805
They tried to expel me.

816
01:08:34,407 --> 01:08:36,921
My parents paid a lot of money
to avoid it.

817
01:08:37,847 --> 01:08:40,202
They're going to Iower my grades.

818
01:08:40,647 --> 01:08:42,683
I mightn't get into coIIege.

819
01:08:48,687 --> 01:08:50,757
Are you crazy?
You'II wake my parents!

820
01:08:50,967 --> 01:08:52,082
Come on.

821
01:08:52,287 --> 01:08:54,676
I'm not cIimbing down there.

822
01:08:54,967 --> 01:08:56,366
-I'm scared.
-Scared?

823
01:08:56,567 --> 01:08:58,398
You're brave.
Come on.

824
01:08:58,847 --> 01:09:00,246
-No!
-Come on.

825
01:09:05,687 --> 01:09:07,166
-Where are we going?
-Come on.

826
01:09:07,647 --> 01:09:09,160
Trust me, Babi.

827
01:09:12,127 --> 01:09:14,163
-Hey, PoIlo!
-Look who's here!

828
01:09:14,487 --> 01:09:16,159
-Great!
-I didn't expect you.

829
01:09:16,367 --> 01:09:19,086
-l toId you.
-l bet 20 euros I didn't have.

830
01:09:19,287 --> 01:09:20,640
Get in the water!

831
01:09:20,847 --> 01:09:22,405
-I haven't got a costume.
-Come on.

832
01:09:22,727 --> 01:09:23,682
No, H...

833
01:09:23,887 --> 01:09:25,843
l've thrown you in before.

834
01:09:26,047 --> 01:09:27,116
Stop...

835
01:09:27,487 --> 01:09:28,283
No!

836
01:09:28,487 --> 01:09:29,761
Come on, it's great!

837
01:09:31,767 --> 01:09:33,200
Save me, Babi!

838
01:09:33,607 --> 01:09:35,404
-Come on, you two!
-Yeah, yeah.

839
01:09:37,967 --> 01:09:40,242
Stop! Stop, pIease!

840
01:10:22,407 --> 01:10:23,920
I have to teII you something.

841
01:10:25,967 --> 01:10:27,241
I'm nervous.

842
01:10:29,647 --> 01:10:30,602
Why?

843
01:10:32,367 --> 01:10:33,800
I've never done it.

844
01:10:38,327 --> 01:10:39,316
Me neither.

845
01:10:40,207 --> 01:10:41,799
Liar!

846
01:10:42,727 --> 01:10:43,842
Liar!

847
01:10:44,647 --> 01:10:47,445
Babi! This Iunatic just
asked me to marry him!

848
01:11:17,207 --> 01:11:18,799
I'm not in a hurry, Babi.

849
01:11:44,727 --> 01:11:46,604
You can't smoke here.

850
01:11:47,407 --> 01:11:48,760
I'II be brief.

851
01:11:50,047 --> 01:11:51,400
From now on,

852
01:11:51,727 --> 01:11:53,718
you'II treat
one pupiI very welI.

853
01:11:54,527 --> 01:11:56,245
If I hear that Babi

854
01:11:56,567 --> 01:11:58,717
has any probIem
because of you

855
01:11:59,927 --> 01:12:01,121
you're in troubIe.

856
01:12:01,887 --> 01:12:04,117
Don't waste your time
threatening me.

857
01:12:04,967 --> 01:12:06,286
You're not the first.

858
01:12:09,647 --> 01:12:11,319
I'II just say one thing.

859
01:12:13,447 --> 01:12:14,675
Listen carefuIIy.

860
01:12:17,247 --> 01:12:18,236
Pepito.

861
01:12:18,847 --> 01:12:19,597
Pepito!

862
01:12:20,607 --> 01:12:21,835
Fetch the baII!

863
01:12:22,167 --> 01:12:23,202
Pepito!

864
01:12:23,407 --> 01:12:24,681
The fucking baII!

865
01:12:25,447 --> 01:12:27,358
This dog must have a trauma.

866
01:12:27,567 --> 01:12:30,240
Like my aunt's dog,
it thinks it's a rabbit.

867
01:12:37,927 --> 01:12:38,996
What's that thing?

868
01:12:39,207 --> 01:12:40,356
No insuIts!

869
01:12:41,047 --> 01:12:43,163
He's Pepito,
and he's a sIow learner.

870
01:12:43,687 --> 01:12:45,200
We bought him between us.

871
01:12:45,407 --> 01:12:46,760
-Who has custody?
-PoIIo.

872
01:12:46,967 --> 01:12:48,798
-But he's staying with his mom.
-What?

873
01:12:51,887 --> 01:12:53,923
-Don't Ieave him here!
-Better take him out

874
01:12:54,127 --> 01:12:55,958
or he'II piss on the carpet.

875
01:12:56,167 --> 01:12:57,361
Bye, AIex.

876
01:12:58,127 --> 01:12:59,355
What's wrong?

877
01:13:07,807 --> 01:13:11,243
If mom hears you're smoking in here,
she'II sIice you up.

878
01:13:12,607 --> 01:13:14,882
But I won't say a word.

879
01:13:18,007 --> 01:13:19,406
ShalI we go see a movie?

880
01:13:20,087 --> 01:13:22,885
I thought everyone knew
I'm grounded for Iife.

881
01:13:24,527 --> 01:13:28,076
We'd pIanned to sIeep over
at Katina's and now I can't go.

882
01:13:30,887 --> 01:13:32,366
Go on, and have fun.

883
01:13:34,767 --> 01:13:36,086
And mom?

884
01:13:36,407 --> 01:13:37,806
I'II take care of that.

885
01:13:43,607 --> 01:13:47,759
I love the smeII of a pipe.
lt reminds me of when I was IittIe.

886
01:13:58,687 --> 01:14:00,006
-Hi!
-Hi!

887
01:14:42,527 --> 01:14:44,438
FOR SALE

888
01:14:50,407 --> 01:14:52,602
Wait here,
and don't Iook.

889
01:14:59,927 --> 01:15:01,155
l hear the sea!

890
01:15:04,567 --> 01:15:05,761
What was that?

891
01:15:12,807 --> 01:15:14,001
Come here.

892
01:15:16,327 --> 01:15:17,760
There's a step, carefuI.

893
01:15:22,087 --> 01:15:23,566
More steps.

894
01:15:27,207 --> 01:15:28,606
Where are we going?

895
01:15:32,327 --> 01:15:34,079
I can smeII it now.

896
01:15:37,807 --> 01:15:39,206
The sea!

897
01:15:56,487 --> 01:15:57,761
Like it?

898
01:16:02,287 --> 01:16:03,322
WeII?

899
01:16:08,967 --> 01:16:10,480
l never want this to end.

900
01:16:32,007 --> 01:16:33,565
This is incredibIe.

901
01:16:34,127 --> 01:16:35,480
It was your house, right?

902
01:16:36,567 --> 01:16:38,046
I've bought it back for you.

903
01:16:38,247 --> 01:16:39,362
You're crazy!

904
01:16:39,647 --> 01:16:41,683
Now we're the owners.

905
01:16:59,687 --> 01:17:00,722
Are you aII right?

906
01:17:01,567 --> 01:17:02,602
What do you think?

907
01:17:03,927 --> 01:17:05,963
Do you want me to be the first?

908
01:17:06,967 --> 01:17:08,241
And the Iast.

909
01:17:09,287 --> 01:17:10,561
Don't Iaugh.

910
01:18:08,567 --> 01:18:10,285
ReIax, my Iove.

911
01:18:11,127 --> 01:18:12,196
Relax.

912
01:18:33,527 --> 01:18:34,801
I Iove you, Babi.

913
01:19:15,567 --> 01:19:16,682
Are you aII right?

914
01:19:18,247 --> 01:19:20,124
-Did I hurt you?
-No.

915
01:19:21,967 --> 01:19:23,525
I'm not very good, am I?

916
01:19:24,687 --> 01:19:26,359
You're perfect.

917
01:19:28,127 --> 01:19:30,277
You made me feeI great.

918
01:19:30,807 --> 01:19:32,001
I'm happy.

919
01:19:32,247 --> 01:19:33,316
I'm happier.

920
01:19:33,647 --> 01:19:35,080
No, I'm much happier.

921
01:19:36,127 --> 01:19:38,846
-From here to BarceIona.
-From here to the sky.

922
01:19:39,047 --> 01:19:40,321
WeII, I'm even happier.

923
01:19:40,527 --> 01:19:41,755
How much?

924
01:19:44,407 --> 01:19:46,079
Three meters above the sky.

925
01:20:28,887 --> 01:20:29,922
Good morning!

926
01:20:46,407 --> 01:20:47,999
Why is she babysitting?

927
01:20:48,727 --> 01:20:49,876
Rich kids don't work.

928
01:20:50,087 --> 01:20:52,681
Her mother has stopped
her alIowance.

929
01:20:52,887 --> 01:20:54,843
Why did you bring Pepito?

930
01:20:55,487 --> 01:20:58,445
He doesn't Iike being aIone.
It upsets him.

931
01:20:58,647 --> 01:21:00,285
No, it upsets you.

932
01:21:03,527 --> 01:21:05,404
We mustn't be apart!

933
01:21:08,047 --> 01:21:09,162
Hi!

934
01:21:10,247 --> 01:21:11,885
You brought PoIIo and the dog?

935
01:21:12,207 --> 01:21:14,482
He can Iook after the kid.

936
01:21:15,847 --> 01:21:17,439
Hey, champ.

937
01:21:18,127 --> 01:21:19,276
You're pIaying tennis!

938
01:21:19,487 --> 01:21:20,761
Get Pepito off the couch!

939
01:21:20,967 --> 01:21:23,435
-He's caIIed Pepito?
-Yes, he is.

940
01:21:23,647 --> 01:21:25,524
And I'm PoIIo.
What's your name?

941
01:21:25,727 --> 01:21:27,957
Show me your favorite part
of the house.

942
01:21:29,447 --> 01:21:31,756
Come on,
or are you scared of me?

943
01:21:32,927 --> 01:21:34,645
Come on, hit it hard.

944
01:21:38,127 --> 01:21:40,482
-Let's go to your parents' room.
-No, come in.

945
01:21:43,527 --> 01:21:44,562
Sit down.

946
01:21:57,847 --> 01:21:59,075
-May I?
-Yes.

947
01:22:23,287 --> 01:22:26,085
-What was that?
-Don't worry, Pollo's in charge.

948
01:22:26,287 --> 01:22:27,879
That's what worries me.

949
01:22:36,647 --> 01:22:39,684
Who the heII do you think you are?
A friend of mine?

950
01:22:39,887 --> 01:22:42,799
-l'm sorry, Babi.
-Get this rabbIe out of here.

951
01:22:43,007 --> 01:22:44,645
-Get out!
-Everyone, out of here.

952
01:22:44,847 --> 01:22:47,680
Get the fuck out!
What were you doing, PoIIo?

953
01:22:48,807 --> 01:22:50,001
l'm sorry.

954
01:22:50,207 --> 01:22:51,879
Parties here don't Iast Iong.

955
01:22:52,087 --> 01:22:53,759
What are they doing here?

956
01:22:54,367 --> 01:22:56,517
You get out too.
I don't want to see you.

957
01:22:57,327 --> 01:22:58,555
Get out!

958
01:22:58,767 --> 01:23:00,246
You Iot don't respect anything!

959
01:23:00,607 --> 01:23:02,404
Babi, this isn't my fauIt!

960
01:23:02,607 --> 01:23:03,676
Get out!

961
01:23:23,127 --> 01:23:26,517
Hi, thi is Babi.
Leave a mesage.

962
01:23:44,927 --> 01:23:47,441
YOU AND I
3 M A S

963
01:24:10,727 --> 01:24:13,878
OK, the meat shouId be rare
with a IittIe salt.

964
01:24:14,207 --> 01:24:15,845
-A IittIe salt.
-And the strawberries?

965
01:24:16,047 --> 01:24:17,844
They're in the fridge.

966
01:24:18,047 --> 01:24:19,400
No, that's wrong!

967
01:24:21,247 --> 01:24:23,966
Add the cream
just before you serve them.

968
01:24:24,167 --> 01:24:27,000
And light the candIes
five minutes before she arrives.

969
01:24:27,207 --> 01:24:28,686
-Five minutes.
-Right.

970
01:24:29,247 --> 01:24:31,966
-Why not apoIogize over the phone?
-The dog!

971
01:24:32,167 --> 01:24:33,600
You're so unromantic!

972
01:24:33,887 --> 01:24:36,117
She's due at 8:00,
but she's aIways 10 minutes earIy.

973
01:24:36,327 --> 01:24:37,282
OK.

974
01:24:37,727 --> 01:24:38,716
OK.

975
01:25:04,727 --> 01:25:05,876
-Yes?
-HeIIo.

976
01:25:07,847 --> 01:25:09,917
Babi, supper's getting coId.

977
01:25:10,127 --> 01:25:12,766
Mom's looking all over
for a ring her mother gave her.

978
01:25:13,087 --> 01:25:15,123
lt' been mising
since your friends were here.

979
01:25:15,527 --> 01:25:18,325

980
01:25:20,527 --> 01:25:22,438
-No, Babi.
-Leave me alone.

981
01:25:50,447 --> 01:25:51,357
Chino...

982
01:25:52,767 --> 01:25:53,677
Watch it!

983
01:25:55,007 --> 01:25:56,804
I don't want any probIems.

984
01:25:59,927 --> 01:26:01,645
You don't want any problems?

985
01:26:02,767 --> 01:26:03,643
Tough guy.

986
01:26:06,647 --> 01:26:07,796
Don't touch me!

987
01:26:08,407 --> 01:26:09,681
Look at him.

988
01:26:09,887 --> 01:26:11,286
He wants a fight.

989
01:26:18,807 --> 01:26:20,286
I just want the ring.

990
01:26:38,527 --> 01:26:41,360
H, stop, pIease!

-H, go away, pIease!

993
01:27:03,607 --> 01:27:05,484
She isn't here!

994
01:27:05,687 --> 01:27:07,405

997
01:27:11,407 --> 01:27:15,116
-I'II calI the poIice.
-I have to give you something.

998
01:27:46,287 --> 01:27:47,356
Why are you crying?

999
01:28:00,727 --> 01:28:01,842
Miss AIcazar,

Babi! Wait!

1004
01:28:37,447 --> 01:28:39,915
Why are you humiIiating our famiIy?

1005
01:28:40,727 --> 01:28:44,276
What wiII they think of us?
We promised we'd heIp them!

1006
01:28:44,487 --> 01:28:46,443
No, you promised, I didn't.

1007
01:28:47,247 --> 01:28:50,159
Stop being ashamed for me,
stop deciding for me.

1008
01:28:50,767 --> 01:28:54,123
I refuse to grow oId

I won't live your Iousy Iife.

1010
01:28:59,087 --> 01:29:02,079

You hear?

1013
01:29:31,287 --> 01:29:33,926
If you keep doing as you pIease,

1014
01:29:35,887 --> 01:29:37,206
Very well.

I passed!

1018
01:29:58,647 --> 01:30:01,081
Be quick,

1019
01:30:02,247 --> 01:30:04,203
I got the best grade!

1022
01:30:12,687 --> 01:30:13,915

1025
01:30:24,327 --> 01:30:27,160
Don't guIp your food.
You know it makes you sick.

1026
01:30:29,407 --> 01:30:31,523
He doesn't want
to go back to the witch.

1027
01:30:31,727 --> 01:30:32,682
Who is it?

1029
01:30:35,087 --> 01:30:37,920

You hear?

1031
01:30:39,087 --> 01:30:40,566

01:30:49,247 --> 01:30:52,125
No, not a private room,

1035
01:30:52,967 --> 01:30:55,242
Yes, a very speciaI occasion.

1036
01:30:55,927 --> 01:30:57,599
Not just her good grades.

1037
01:30:57,807 --> 01:31:00,241
A daughter doesn't
turn 18 every day.

1038
01:31:00,447 --> 01:31:03,280
I'II send the guest Iist

1042

01:31:29,607 --> 01:31:31,245
Good morning.

1045
01:31:32,647 --> 01:31:33,762
I wanted to thank you...

1046
01:31:37,367 --> 01:31:38,356
Pepito?

1047
01:31:58,207 --> 01:31:59,401
I want to marry her.

1048
01:32:00,247 --> 01:32:01,760
First you need a job.

1049
01:32:02,127 --> 01:32:06,439
Or wiII she go on paying
for everything, Iike she does now.

1050
01:32:06,647 --> 01:32:08,444
Tomorrow, I'm going to win.

1051
01:32:09,287 --> 01:32:10,561
So she can see me do it.

1052
01:32:13,407 --> 01:32:14,920
Our girIs are incredibIe.

1053
01:32:16,407 --> 01:32:17,601
We have to live up to them.

1054
01:32:19,247 --> 01:32:20,396
She'II Iove it.

1055
01:32:24,647 --> 01:32:26,558
-I'll get it.
-H...

1056
01:32:28,607 --> 01:32:30,199
Promise you'II be there.

1057
01:32:30,847 --> 01:32:31,882
What do you think?

1058
01:32:47,407 --> 01:32:48,476
PoIIo...

1059
01:32:57,087 --> 01:32:58,998
It's Babi!
Here, take this.

1060
01:33:00,447 --> 01:33:01,323
HeIIo.

1061

1062
01:33:04,807 --> 01:33:05,683
Sure.

1063
01:33:05,887 --> 01:33:07,445
You threatened my teacher!

1064
01:33:08,887 --> 01:33:10,206
Are you stupid?

1065
01:33:11,967 --> 01:33:13,286
You screwed me, H.

1066
01:33:15,087 --> 01:33:17,726
-l thought that if...
-Stop thinking for me!

1067
01:33:18,847 --> 01:33:20,803
Don't treat me Iike a moron.

1068
01:33:24,767 --> 01:33:26,644
Let's Ieave it for a whiIe.

1069
01:33:47,167 --> 01:33:49,476
-ShaII I say anything to him?
-No.

1070
01:33:54,767 --> 01:33:56,883
I'II be aIong after the race, OK?

1071
01:34:10,247 --> 01:34:12,477
The dopey upstairs neighbor,

1072
01:34:12,687 --> 01:34:14,200
he'II take us to the party.

1073
01:34:22,447 --> 01:34:24,039
You're a fucking genius.

1074
01:34:26,327 --> 01:34:27,237
Come on.

1075
01:35:10,967 --> 01:35:13,083
-Have you seen H?
-No, I haven't.

1076
01:35:39,367 --> 01:35:40,163
Babi,

1077
01:35:40,447 --> 01:35:41,800
come here a moment.

1078
01:35:45,247 --> 01:35:46,202
Carlos,

1079
01:35:46,447 --> 01:35:47,357

-Happy birthday.
-Thank you.

01:35:52,927 --> 01:35:54,155
My Iove.

01:35:54,447 --> 01:35:55,596
A photo.

1083
01:36:00,607 --> 01:36:03,246
What wouId happen
if I asked your sister out?

1084
01:36:03,647 --> 01:36:07,276
Her boyfriend wouId break
every bone in your body.

1085
01:36:07,647 --> 01:36:08,716
That's all.

1086
01:36:09,207 --> 01:36:10,276
Hi, dad!

1087
01:36:11,047 --> 01:36:12,116
HeIIo.

1088
01:36:25,247 --> 01:36:26,475
Hey, where's your buddy?

1089
01:36:26,687 --> 01:36:28,518
I want some fucking revenge.

1090
01:36:29,567 --> 01:36:30,761
I'm racing for him today.

1091
01:38:41,527 --> 01:38:42,642
I Iove you.

1092
01:39:02,167 --> 01:39:04,123
Who is our daughter dancing with?

1093
01:39:05,487 --> 01:39:07,318
With a good boy, RafaeIa.

1094
01:40:15,607 --> 01:40:17,677
Be careful!
Stop, stop!

1095
01:40:24,287 --> 01:40:26,482
Forgive me, I'm sorry, Babi.

1096
01:40:26,687 --> 01:40:28,837
It's all right, Gustavo.

1097
01:40:36,487 --> 01:40:38,045
I said it's aII right.
Leave me aIone!

1098
01:40:38,247 --> 01:40:40,556
She toId you twice
to Ieave her aIone! Get out!

1099
01:40:40,847 --> 01:40:42,917
I'm just trying to heIp her.

1100
01:40:47,447 --> 01:40:48,800
What are you doing, H?

1101
01:40:49,847 --> 01:40:51,166
He didn't do it on purpose!

1102
01:40:53,967 --> 01:40:55,195
-Are you OK?
-Yes.

1103
01:40:56,127 --> 01:40:57,526
You think he meant to do it?

1104
01:41:07,287 --> 01:41:08,402
Yes?

1105
01:41:14,127 --> 01:41:16,004
Come on.

1106
01:41:16,847 --> 01:41:18,166
I'm sorry, CIaudio.

1107
01:41:45,287 --> 01:41:47,005
-Katina! What is it?
-PoIIo.

1108
01:41:47,527 --> 01:41:49,119
Where is he?
They won't teII me.

1109
01:41:49,847 --> 01:41:51,075
Look for him, H.

1110
01:41:51,327 --> 01:41:52,646
PIease, l'm begging you.

1111
01:42:00,567 --> 01:42:01,761
Where is he?

1112
01:42:02,847 --> 01:42:03,836
Over there.

1113
01:42:10,567 --> 01:42:12,444
You can't get through.

1114
01:42:18,367 --> 01:42:19,197
CaIm down.

1115
01:42:19,407 --> 01:42:22,126
Let go of me! Let go of me!
PoIIo!

1116
01:42:22,767 --> 01:42:25,804
Let go of me!

1117
01:42:56,607 --> 01:42:58,563
H!
H, stop, pIease!

1119
01:43:24,167 --> 01:43:25,202
-Don't touch me!
-Listen.

1120
01:43:25,407 --> 01:43:26,396
-Don't touch me!
-Listen.

1121
01:43:26,607 --> 01:43:27,483
l can't take any more.

1122
01:43:27,687 --> 01:43:30,281
Your Iife is fuII of shit
and death and blood,

1123
01:43:30,487 --> 01:43:31,886
you don't care about me.

1124
01:43:32,087 --> 01:43:34,362
I do care,
and Babi, I swear that...

1125
01:43:34,567 --> 01:43:37,445
Don't swear anything.
You don't care about anyone.

1126
01:43:37,647 --> 01:43:39,000
Not me or your family
or your best friend.

1127
01:43:39,207 --> 01:43:40,037
It's not my fauIt!

1128
01:43:40,247 --> 01:43:41,441
-Yes, it is!
-It's not!

1129
01:43:41,647 --> 01:43:43,000
Of course it is!

1130
01:43:44,087 --> 01:43:47,238
You kiIIed PoIIo!
You kiIIed him!

1131
01:45:10,007 --> 01:45:12,202
There' alway a moment
when the road forks.

1132
01:45:17,847 --> 01:45:21,726
Each one goe off, thinking
the road will come together again.

1133
01:45:29,967 --> 01:45:30,956
Come in.

1134
01:45:33,527 --> 01:45:36,121
You see the other peron
getting aller and maller.

1135
01:45:39,567 --> 01:45:40,886
That' all right.

1136
01:45:41,527 --> 01:45:43,040
We're ade for each other.

1137
01:45:48,887 --> 01:45:50,400
She'll be there at the end.

1138
01:45:53,207 --> 01:45:54,720
But at the end
only one thing happen.

1139
01:46:03,087 --> 01:46:04,566
The fucking winter come.

1140
01:46:34,327 --> 01:46:37,080
Yes, yes. Don't keep on.
I'm eating weII, AIex.

1141
01:46:38,807 --> 01:46:40,684
There's someone at the door.
I'II call you Iater.

1142
01:46:51,767 --> 01:46:53,086
Merry Christmas!

1143
01:46:58,487 --> 01:47:00,205
Come in, please.

1144
01:47:06,607 --> 01:47:09,440
I haven't been around much
these Iast months.

1145
01:47:11,367 --> 01:47:12,846
I couIdn't, I'm sorry.

1146
01:47:14,487 --> 01:47:15,840
Don't worry.

1147
01:47:20,527 --> 01:47:22,245
Santa Ieft this for you.

1148
01:47:42,887 --> 01:47:44,878
l miss him so much, H.

1149
01:47:46,167 --> 01:47:47,316
I can't...

1150
01:47:47,727 --> 01:47:50,366
Sometimes I think
I'II never find anyone Iike him.

1151
01:47:51,247 --> 01:47:52,839
No, no one Iike him.

1152
01:47:54,967 --> 01:47:57,037
But you'II find someone
who'II make you happy.

1153
01:48:00,207 --> 01:48:01,720
Have you spoken to Babi?

1154
01:48:06,087 --> 01:48:07,122
Have you?

1155
01:48:09,247 --> 01:48:11,715
We Iost touch after the accident.

1156
01:48:12,847 --> 01:48:14,565
I think she's with another crowd.

1157
01:48:16,327 --> 01:48:18,716
And she's going out
with some guy.

1158
01:48:22,127 --> 01:48:24,277
Maybe you shouId forget her.

1159
01:48:29,247 --> 01:48:30,680
Want to stay for supper?

1160
01:48:32,847 --> 01:48:33,802
l can't tonight.

1161
01:48:34,447 --> 01:48:36,039
Some other day.

1162
01:48:50,127 --> 01:48:51,242
Thank you.

1163
01:48:56,047 --> 01:48:57,116
That's OK.

1164
01:49:36,327 --> 01:49:37,237
Yes?

1165
01:49:37,447 --> 01:49:38,402
HeIIo.

1166
01:49:40,327 --> 01:49:41,282
Is Babi there?

1167
01:49:42,447 --> 01:49:43,516
Just a minute.

1168
01:49:44,727 --> 01:49:45,682
Bye, mom.

1169
01:49:45,887 --> 01:49:47,002
CalI me tomorrow.

1170
01:49:48,007 --> 01:49:48,996
Take care of her.

1171
01:49:49,207 --> 01:49:50,435
l will, Rafaela.

1172
01:50:04,287 --> 01:50:05,402
Are you ready?

1173
01:50:07,327 --> 01:50:08,885
We're leaving in five minutes.

1174
01:50:51,247 --> 01:50:52,441
What are you doing here?

1175
01:50:53,447 --> 01:50:55,517
-I Iocked myseIf out.
-OK, come on.

1176
01:50:58,927 --> 01:51:00,076
What's wrong?

1177
01:51:01,487 --> 01:51:02,556
Hugo, what's wrong?

1178
01:51:04,687 --> 01:51:06,006
What's happened?

1179
01:51:37,647 --> 01:51:40,480
Suddenly you realize
that everything is over.

1180
01:51:42,887 --> 01:51:44,081
Really.

1181
01:51:52,327 --> 01:51:53,646
I'm going away for a while.

1182
01:51:56,127 --> 01:51:57,446
To London.

1183
01:51:57,767 --> 01:51:59,041
To work.

1184
01:52:04,287 --> 01:52:05,766
That's a good idea.

1185
01:52:16,207 --> 01:52:17,799
I can't stay here.

1186
01:52:18,407 --> 01:52:19,726
There' no going back.

1187
01:52:20,847 --> 01:52:22,166
You feel it.

1188
01:52:45,527 --> 01:52:48,883
nd then you try to remeber
at what point it all began.

1189
01:52:50,287 --> 01:52:52,926
nd you dicover it tarted
before you thought.

1190
01:52:53,527 --> 01:52:54,562
HeIIo.

1191
01:52:58,647 --> 01:52:59,716
HeIIo.

1192
01:53:00,327 --> 01:53:01,442
Long before.

1193
01:53:04,527 --> 01:53:07,246
nd it' at that moment

1194
01:53:07,567 --> 01:53:10,320
you realize
thing only happen once.

1195
01:53:29,407 --> 01:53:33,195
nd no matter how hard you try
you'll never feel the ame again.

1196
01:53:34,047 --> 01:53:37,722
You'll never again feel
you're three meters above the ky.

1197
01:53:42,207 --> 01:53:45,756
THREE METERS ABOVE THE SKY

1198
