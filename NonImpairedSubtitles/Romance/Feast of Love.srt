00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:11,663
You...

163
00:11:12,638 --> 00:11:15,300
You have any experience
with this kind of work?

164
00:11:15,374 --> 00:11:17,535
- No.
- OSCAR: Neither did I when I started.

165
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:20,477
- Do you like coffee?
- Not much.

166
00:11:20,913 --> 00:11:22,881
OSCAR: She'll learn to love it.

167
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:25,080
But why here?

168
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:27,076
I don't know.

169
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:29,644
I just kind of felt
a harmonic convergence in this place.

170
00:11:29,722 --> 00:11:32,850
She's right, you know?
I felt the same kind of thing.

Ah.

HARRY: Bradley.

I think you'd better hire the girl
or you're going to lose Oscar.

And if you lose Oscar,

Who says I'm nervous?

It must be pretty weird
to be married and straight,

you're thinking about a woman.

you and me.

It's going to be, like, Kathryn and Jenny.

- Barlow.
- "Chloe"?

It used to be plain old Chloe,
but I customized it.

Well, you know, Chloe...

You're really pretty.
Has anybody ever told you that?

205

No, more conventional this time.

214
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:01,939
Classical, in fact, like Romeo and Juliet.

215

They laid eyes on each other
and their fates were sealed.

Did you talk to the dean today?

you've got to let him know.

and it stands out from all the rest,
you know?

or they'd throw
all their things in the street.

I had this dream one night
while I was wasted.

There was this African monkey
whispering all this creepy shit in my ear.

I was gonna die young,

And that morning I woke up
and I went to my first meeting.

292
00:20:05,437 --> 00:20:09,498
It was seven months and two weeks ago.

293
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:16,440

It doesn't scare you?

Most junkies, you know,
even if they never use again,

297
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:38,161
it doesn't matter. It's too late.

298
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:43,433
They're just gone,
you know, permanent zombies.

299
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:48,136
But then there's junkies where
all the horrible places they've been,

300
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:51,776
all the horrible shit they've done,

301
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:55,920
the fact that they come back from it

302
00:20:56,588 --> 00:21:00,854
makes them better people
than if they'd never used in the first place.

303
00:21:04,796 --> 00:21:06,127
That's you.

Yeah, well, don't you come in this house
again unless I invite you.

322

I can't be responsible for.

but I can be, too.

I'll protect you from anything.

327
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:00,169
Bradley, we have to talk.

328
00:23:00,445 --> 00:23:01,844
No, hold on.

329
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,255

330
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:20,490
Happy birthday, sweetheart.

331
00:23:23,602 --> 00:23:25,126
It's a dog.

No. No, no. That's not... It's the dog.

That's Bradley Jr.
That's the dog you picked out.

334
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:36,745
But I hate dogs and you know that.

335
00:23:36,815 --> 00:23:39,545
No, you don't. You... You love dogs.

336
00:23:39,618 --> 00:23:43,349
I would have said anything
to get out of that room.

337
00:23:44,489 --> 00:23:47,617
I don't want a goddamn dog!

338
00:23:47,692 --> 00:23:51,628
And you know that, but you
got me one anyway, because you...

339
00:23:51,696 --> 00:23:55,564
- Okay. Okay, time out, Kathryn...
- Because you have no idea who I am.

340
00:23:55,634 --> 00:24:00,799
I mean, I might as well be invisible to you.
What color are my eyes, Bradley?

341
00:24:00,872 --> 00:24:03,534
- What?
- Yeah, what color are my eyes?

342
00:24:05,377 --> 00:24:07,709
- Green!
- Hazel!

343
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:11,738
My eyes are hazel! I mean, Christ!
You're an artist!

344
00:24:11,817 --> 00:24:14,479
Okay, but there's a little greenish,
hazel tint.

345
00:24:14,553 --> 00:24:16,544
All right, listen,
we're rushing the dog thing.

346
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:17,610
- You're right.
- No.

347
00:24:17,689 --> 00:24:20,556
No, it's not just the dog thing
or the eye thing. It's everything.

348
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:24,061
It's every goddamn thing!
I cannot do this for one more day!

349
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:26,393

- What? You're leaving?

- Where are you going with this?

You know the shortstop,
the one that you asked over to our table?

352
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:35,806
Yes! She tagged you out.

353
00:24:36,107 --> 00:24:40,237
Yeah, well,
I'm not the only one she tagged out.

354
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:41,472
But you wouldn't know that,

355
00:24:41,546 --> 00:24:43,605
because you have your
head so far up your ass.

356
00:24:43,682 --> 00:24:46,242
Wait, you... You're friends with her?

357
00:24:49,955 --> 00:24:52,617
Wow. Goodbye, Bradley.

358
00:25:03,268 --> 00:25:06,169
If Kathryn's meant to be with women,
so be it,

359
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:11,233
but I just can't help but think
maybe I did something to cause it.

360
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:13,333
Mmm?

361
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:16,006
To put her off men forever.

362
00:25:18,617 --> 00:25:22,883
But what? Never cheated.

363
00:25:24,256 --> 00:25:25,746
I didn't lie.

364
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:30,487
I made love to her on a regular basis.

365
00:25:42,574 --> 00:25:45,008
She fell in love, that's all.

366
00:25:46,845 --> 00:25:48,107
One minute she was married,

367
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:50,511
next minute there was this person
right in front of her,

368
00:25:50,582 --> 00:25:54,109
whom she couldn't ignore
no matter how hard she tried.

369

How do you know that?

370
00:25:57,522 --> 00:26:02,118
Well, I was there when they met.
So were you.

371
00:26:04,596 --> 00:26:08,430
Bradley, look.
Try focusing on simple pleasures.

372
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,064
You know? Small blessings.

That's not for me to say.

- There's a start.

- Best espresso in Portland. The best!

We're going to keep him.

Not anymore. He's bonded with us.

- No...
- His name is Gumbo now.

I think Kathryn is a selfish bitch.

is go straight to the pound

It's null and void.

my responsibility is to him first, okay?

I hope you told her no.

I didn't.

No, I tried to give her a perspective.

I asked her questions. All very Socratic.

- What if I hadn't?

What if I'd taken a stronger stance?

What if I'd just told him,
"Son, this is right. This is wrong"?

You were a wonderful father. Nothing...

Nothing that you could have done
would have stopped him.

You don't know that.

00:42:37,788 --> 00:42:40,416
We don't know
what might have happened.

BRADLEY: Yeah!

It's pretty much
exactly what you asked for, Bradley.

One bedroom plus a studio.

616
00:43:10,287 --> 00:43:12,983
But the important thing to remember
about this place is...

617
00:43:13,057 --> 00:43:16,584
The important thing
is whether or not you had fun last night.

618
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:19,891
- Yes, I had a good time.
- What's that, Diana?

619
00:43:19,964 --> 00:43:24,697
- We always have a good time together.
- How come you never got married?

620
00:43:25,569 --> 00:43:28,231
Can we just stay on track here, Bradley,
for a minute?

621
00:43:28,305 --> 00:43:30,398
The owner will take a second mortgage,

622
00:43:30,474 --> 00:43:31,839
which means
that you can get out of renting...

623
00:43:31,909 --> 00:43:35,174
Is it because you never met anybody
as lovable as me?

or are you just jerking my chain?

you came into my life?

635
00:44:20,624 --> 00:44:23,422
Come on. You would have
found a place sooner or later.

636
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:25,428
That's not what I mean.

<i>Will play themselves out</i>

<i>That's all, folks.</i>

643
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:08,462
That was amazing.

644
00:45:11,108 --> 00:45:14,043
You're disgusting.
That's a disgusting habit.

645
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:27,622
Hey, how's your boyfriend?

646
00:45:28,992 --> 00:45:33,691
He's fine. Thank you for asking.

647
00:45:40,037 --> 00:45:43,268
Okay, I gotta know something.

648
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:44,329
Mmm-hmm?

649
00:45:45,542 --> 00:45:47,373

Well, he's not stupid, or inconsiderate.

652
00:45:55,853 --> 00:46:01,155
He's not obnoxious, or violent,

653
00:46:01,225 --> 00:46:04,490
or boring, or annoying.

654
00:46:04,561 --> 00:46:07,553
He's not a bad dresser,
he's not unemployed,

655
00:46:07,631 --> 00:46:10,964
and he is not unhandsome, either.

656
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:17,097
An absence of disqualifiers
is a rare and beautiful thing.

00:46:18,809 --> 00:46:22,176
Oh, and did I mention?
He's not married, either.

- You're extending your leave of absence?
- Indefinitely.

664
00:46:49,339 --> 00:46:52,433
- But I thought...
- I changed my mind.

665
00:46:52,509 --> 00:46:56,138
Honestly, I just don't feel like
I can be of much help to them now.

666
00:46:56,213 --> 00:46:59,046
Don't be ridiculous. They're just kids.

667
00:46:59,716 --> 00:47:02,651
All the more reason
to stay out of their way.

Go ahead.

- Where'd you get that?

What are you doing here?

695
00:48:55,866 --> 00:48:59,029
Well, I arrived about 28 years ago
and never left.

00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:01,063

- How did we never put that together?
- I don't know.

Stranger things have happened. A re-gift.

701

I'll use it to christen the fridge.

702
00:49:14,051 --> 00:49:15,541
It also makes a good doorstop.

Hey, honey!
I want you to meet somebody.

704

I can't believe it! You know,
I love this street. I love this area.

705
00:49:21,825 --> 00:49:25,022
Bradley, there's something
I need to share with you.

706
00:49:25,228 --> 00:49:28,891
This house has a history.

707
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:36,238
Over the years, we've watched
happy young couples move in here

708
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:39,002
and before you know it,
they're at each other's throats,

709
00:49:39,076 --> 00:49:42,307
and within weeks or months,
they're moving out.

710
00:49:42,379 --> 00:49:43,903
Separately.

711
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:46,950
Now, this has happened
three times in a row.

712
00:49:47,851 --> 00:49:50,411
Now, I'm a man of logic.
I think it's just coincidence.

713
00:49:50,487 --> 00:49:52,751
But, Esther, my wife,

714
00:49:53,890 --> 00:49:57,018
she thinks supernatural forces
are at work.

715
00:49:57,094 --> 00:50:00,029
She thinks the place is cursed.

716
00:50:00,564 --> 00:50:01,929
Hi.

717
00:50:02,199 --> 00:50:03,530
Hi.

718
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:06,535
Diana, this is Professor Harry Stevenson.

719
00:50:06,636 --> 00:50:08,103
- Hi, it's nice to meet you.
- Harry, this is Diana.

720
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:09,263
Nice to meet you.

721
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:12,831
My, my.
You're even more beautiful out of the rain.

722
00:50:13,944 --> 00:50:17,641
Now, how is it possible
that you were unattached?

723
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:22,379
Well, I have impossibly high standards.

724
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:25,688
So, you think this place is haunted?

725
00:50:26,156 --> 00:50:29,057
Well, my wife does.

726
00:50:30,894 --> 00:50:33,886
Well, that's okay.
We're not afraid of ghosts.

727
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:47,567
Hey, what happened?

728
00:50:47,644 --> 00:50:49,737
Did you see the video guy?
Did you talk to him?

729
00:50:49,813 --> 00:50:51,713
- What'd he say?
- Yeah, easy, sleazy.

730
00:50:51,782 --> 00:50:54,012
- What'd he say?
- Here, here.

731
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:00,284
That's it?

732
00:51:00,957 --> 00:51:03,790
- Two hundred and forty bucks?
- Well, nobody's ordering it.

733
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:07,819
- What do you mean nobody's ordering it?
- It's not hot enough.

734
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:09,866
- What?
- That's what he said.

735
00:51:09,933 --> 00:51:12,163
- It's totally hot. You said so yourself.
- Yeah, I know.

736
00:51:12,235 --> 00:51:15,227
But, I mean, I'm just a little old girl.

737
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:21,034
You guys are too in love, he says.
You laugh and shit.

738
00:51:21,111 --> 00:51:24,137
I guess when it comes to porn,
that's a drag.

739
00:51:25,115 --> 00:51:27,948
This isn't enough for a place with a foyer.

740
00:51:28,885 --> 00:51:30,113
Hey.

741
00:51:31,788 --> 00:51:33,915
Hey, we all got dreams.

742
00:51:33,990 --> 00:51:36,788
I mean,
I want to buy new tits and a hybrid.

743
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:38,122
Oh...

744
00:51:38,495 --> 00:51:40,690
Tell your friend he's an asshole.

745
00:52:15,499 --> 00:52:16,523
Yes?

746
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:20,559
Hi. I left my bike out on the street.
Is it gonna be safe?

747
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:22,798
Laurel and Hardy says it is.

748
00:52:22,873 --> 00:52:25,899
Tarot reading is $12, palm reading, $12.

750
00:52:31,448 --> 00:52:34,008
Well, can't get the future for free.

751
00:52:38,221 --> 00:52:40,815
Okay, honey,
what you want to know about?

752
00:52:40,891 --> 00:52:43,758
I have this boyfriend, Oscar.

753
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:46,421
Handsome boy, almost pretty.
That the one?

754
00:52:48,064 --> 00:52:51,192
Okay, we'll start with a palm reading.
You sit there.

755
00:52:59,643 --> 00:53:01,873
When did this Oscar pass over?

756
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,807
Pass over? You mean die?

757
00:53:07,651 --> 00:53:11,314
No, Oscar didn't die. He's fine.
He's just fine.

758
00:53:15,759 --> 00:53:17,920
Well, we can always ask the cards.

759
00:53:44,154 --> 00:53:46,714
I've seen better cards, I'll say that.

760
00:53:46,790 --> 00:53:48,121
Honey...

761
00:53:49,526 --> 00:53:52,723
It's important to take the future
with a grain of salt.

762
00:53:52,796 --> 00:53:55,321
I want the truth, Mrs. Maggarolian.

763
00:53:56,399 --> 00:53:58,094
Both Laurel and Hardy are telling me

764
00:53:58,168 --> 00:54:02,605
that his future prospects are not so hot.

765
00:54:07,877 --> 00:54:12,041
I didn't see that much of your future,
so I'm gonna give you a little refund.

766
00:54:12,649 --> 00:54:14,048
Stop on your way home and get Oscar

767
00:54:14,117 --> 00:54:17,211
a couple of cheeseburgers
and some French fries.

768
00:54:17,287 --> 00:54:18,652
He'll love that.

769
00:54:21,324 --> 00:54:23,315
If you really love him...

770
00:54:26,129 --> 00:54:28,859
People can keep other people alive.

771
00:54:30,533 --> 00:54:32,160
Trust me on that.

772
00:54:34,838 --> 00:54:36,032
CHLOE: Oscar?

773
00:54:38,308 --> 00:54:39,434
Oscar.

774
00:54:41,645 --> 00:54:44,409
- Oscar, wake up.
- What? I'm up.

775
00:54:45,081 --> 00:54:46,480
Hi.

776
00:54:46,816 --> 00:54:48,511
- Hey.
- Hi.

777
00:54:49,185 --> 00:54:51,210
- What's that?
- I brought you cheeseburgers.

778
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:54,519
Oh, nice.
I was just dreaming about cheeseburgers.

779
00:54:58,261 --> 00:54:59,353
Hey.

780
00:55:02,499 --> 00:55:03,796
Marry me.

781
00:55:05,669 --> 00:55:08,433
- What?
- Let's get married. You and me.

782
00:55:10,307 --> 00:55:11,535
Really?

783
00:55:12,742 --> 00:55:16,838
Yeah. Yes. Of course I'll marry you.

784
00:55:33,363 --> 00:55:37,993
She's sorry she couldn't be here.
She's writing up an offer.

785
00:55:38,068 --> 00:55:40,502
She's dying to meet you, by the way.

786
00:55:40,570 --> 00:55:42,834
From what I've seen out the window,
she's quite a looker.

787
00:55:42,906 --> 00:55:47,309
Oh, is she ever!
I mean, what the heck she sees in me I...

788
00:55:48,411 --> 00:55:50,208
I don't know.

789
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:54,182
- Must be your inner beauty.
- Or all that free coffee.

790
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:57,185
Honestly, I feel like
I'm the luckiest man alive. I...

791
00:55:57,253 --> 00:56:00,313
She is this force of nature.
I mean, she is so smart

It's like living with a wild animal, or...

What did you say?
How did you get out of that one?

805
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:08,656
I didn't, actually. I said yes.

806
00:57:13,863 --> 00:57:16,889
What do you mean, you said yes? You...

807

You're going to marry him?
You're going to marry him.

808

You're going to tear this guy apart.

- You know that.
- Oh, come on.

810

That's what you do to the
nice ones, Diana. Come on, I know you.

811
00:57:32,215 --> 00:57:34,740
- Oh, Jesus, David. I'm not that bad.
- I know every square inch of you.

812
00:57:34,818 --> 00:57:39,016
Yes, you are that bad.
You and me, we're the same like that.

- We're mean and ill-tempered.
- Really? Well, not around Bradley, I'm not.

When I'm with him, I'm nice.
I'm actually a nice person, David...

- Really?
...some of the time.

Okay. Well, if you're so fucking nice,
what are you doing here with me?

I don't know. We're having sex, I guess.
That's what we do, you and me.

Okay. All right,
so if you are going to marry this guy...

I am gonna marry him.

If you're going to marry
this Bradley person

shouldn't you at least
try to be with him exclusively?

You're the one
with the wedding ring, not me.

- Yeah, it's not the same thing.
- Yes, it is.

No, it's not the same thing!

828

You're going to enter into a marriage,
a first-timer.

829
00:58:21,030 --> 00:58:22,930
You haven't even tried to be faithful
to this guy?

830

I was faithful to Karen
for 11 fucking years!

831
00:58:25,535 --> 00:58:26,832
I gave that marriage everything that I had.

832

- Oh, Jesus Christ!
- What have you given this guy, huh?

833
00:58:28,438 --> 00:58:29,905
What have you given him?
Do you even love him?

- David, I'm done with this!
- Do you love him?

I find him exceedingly lovable.

Yeah, that's not what I asked.

Get the fuck out of my house!

No.

You're gonna marry a guy that you're
not even sure you're in love with.

843
00:58:55,965 --> 00:58:58,433
You deserve to be slapped. You're a cunt.

for both of us.

Don't say anything.

Can we... Can we just stop for a minute
and, please, can we just talk about this?

I think it would be better
if we just don't see each other again.

On our wedding night,
you remember how scared I was?

Hey, are we supposed to bring something
to this party?

952

It looks great. Enjoy it.

- It's okay.

Well, listen, regarding this house,

957

I'll help them out.

962
01:09:42,011 --> 01:09:45,174

- Good, good, good.

That sounds good. You all right?

966
01:09:53,956 --> 01:09:56,356
I'm gonna go get a drink.
Do you want anything?

967
01:09:56,425 --> 01:09:57,915
Just a beer, please.

- Hey.

- Thank you so much.

971

- I'm sorry?
- Karen Watson.

972
01:10:07,169 --> 01:10:10,570
My husband, Dave, and I bought a house
from you a few years ago.

973
01:10:11,173 --> 01:10:14,870
Oh, right. The two-story Georgian.

974
01:10:14,944 --> 01:10:17,606
- Exactly.
- On Walnut Street.

975
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:21,980
- So you're still happy with the house?
- Oh, well, we love it. At least I do.

976
01:10:22,051 --> 01:10:26,147
David's just so busy.

977
01:10:26,222 --> 01:10:28,019
He's not around much.

978

I'm... I'm sorry. Could you excuse me?

979
01:10:37,166 --> 01:10:39,361
I left the house, I asked my wife,
"Do you have the directions?"

980
01:10:39,435 --> 01:10:40,493
She said, "I don't have the directions."

981
01:10:40,569 --> 01:10:41,866
I'm like, "Well, I don't have the directions."

982
01:10:41,937 --> 01:10:44,428
So we get in the car and start driving
and I use my little thing,

983
01:10:44,506 --> 01:10:46,406
and I press the button
and put the address in

984
01:10:46,475 --> 01:10:48,306
and I start going.
It says, "Make a right. Make a right."

986
01:10:58,587 --> 01:11:00,179
Hello, David.

987
01:11:03,692 --> 01:11:07,059
That's... That's my shirt you're wearing.

988
01:11:07,129 --> 01:11:09,962
Yes, it is, as a matter of fact.

989
01:11:11,467 --> 01:11:13,264
Do you want it back?

990
01:11:16,705 --> 01:11:18,639
No, it's a little late for that.

991
01:11:18,707 --> 01:11:20,197
You know that was
a birthday present from Karen.

992
01:11:20,276 --> 01:11:22,107
No, I didn't know that.

993

there are hundreds of shirts like this

walking around Portland, David.

995
01:11:25,914 --> 01:11:27,905
But that one's got a button missing
from the left collar.

996
01:11:27,983 --> 01:11:33,444
Yeah. Well, I'm sorry
about this hideous mess that I've created.

And I didn't know that you already knew
that terrible things were going to happen.

1268
01:35:13,441 --> 01:35:16,569
Esther and I want you to come
and live with us.

1269
01:35:18,045 --> 01:35:19,774
Be our little girl.

1270
01:35:28,756 --> 01:35:30,189
Say yes.

1271
01:35:31,525 --> 01:35:33,322
Please say yes.

1272
01:35:35,696 --> 01:35:36,754
Yes.

1273
01:35:38,232 --> 01:35:39,358
Yes.

1274
01:35:40,801 --> 01:35:41,790
(CRYING)

1275
01:35:47,575 --> 01:35:48,735
Yes.

1276
01:35:49,944 --> 01:35:55,041
Esther and I will give you and your baby
all the love we have left to give.

1277
01:35:58,519 --> 01:36:00,111
Let's go home.

1278
01:36:07,194 --> 01:36:10,425
<i>HARRY: The unexpected is always upon us.</i>

1279
01:36:11,866 --> 01:36:14,664
<i>And of all the gifts arrayed before me,</i>

1280
01:36:14,735 --> 01:36:19,399
<i>this one thought at this moment in my life</i>
<i>is the most precious.</i>

1281
01:36:21,175 --> 01:36:24,941
<i>And so, we begin again.</i>
