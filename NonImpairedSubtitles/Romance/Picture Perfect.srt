1
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:32,614
I... I really don't
need to wear one.

2
00:00:32,682 --> 00:00:34,115
What?

3
00:00:34,184 --> 00:00:36,618
Yeah. I tested
negative, and, um...

4
00:00:36,686 --> 00:00:40,122
I've got this
unbelievable control.

5
00:00:41,658 --> 00:00:43,626
Ahem. Excuse me.

6
00:00:43,693 --> 00:00:45,126
Excuse me.
Up, up, up.

7
00:00:45,195 --> 00:00:46,628
What?
Something wrong?

8
00:00:46,696 --> 00:00:48,630
No. No, that was great.

9
00:00:48,698 --> 00:00:50,131
I had a really
nice night.

10
00:00:51,701 --> 00:00:53,362
Did-Did I
miss something?

11
00:00:53,436 --> 00:00:55,836
Nope, nothing.
You didn't miss anything.

12
00:00:55,905 --> 00:00:57,805
Nothing.

13
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:01,576
Look...

14
00:01:01,644 --> 00:01:03,578
I'll-I'll-
I'll wear one.

15
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:04,874
I'll happily wear one.

16
00:01:04,948 --> 00:01:07,576
But I just gotta
tell you right now it's...

17
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,845
it's just... it's not
going to be as good.

18
00:01:09,919 --> 00:01:12,547
It's not going
to be as...

19
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:15,590
I feel like I know you.

20
00:01:15,658 --> 00:01:17,592
I feel like I can
be honest with you.

21
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:21,289
Yeah. Um... you should really
ignore all those feelings.

22
00:01:21,364 --> 00:01:23,093
Can I call you?

23
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:25,100
No.

24
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:27,466
Is that a real no
or a...

25
00:01:27,537 --> 00:01:29,971
No, you should
consider that a...

26
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,064
hard no.

27
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:49,123
Hey, Ma, do me a favor.

28
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:50,659
Don't ever fix me up again.

29
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:56,423
I'm sitting

30
00:01:56,499 --> 00:01:58,763
Sitting in a boat all day

31
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:01,765
I been thinkin'

32
00:02:01,838 --> 00:02:04,705
Thinkin' what I might say

33
00:02:04,774 --> 00:02:06,935
I been lookin'

34
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:09,877
Over the top of that hill

35
00:02:09,946 --> 00:02:11,971
And I been battlin'

36
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:13,982
Battlin'with my will

37
00:02:15,985 --> 00:02:20,547
I got somethin'
to say to you

38
00:02:20,623 --> 00:02:25,253
Yeah, I got something I want
you to show me how to do

39
00:02:25,328 --> 00:02:27,091
'Cause I'm hungry, Lord

40
00:02:27,163 --> 00:02:28,391
The lake is full

41
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:31,596
Show me how to catch a fish

42
00:02:31,668 --> 00:02:33,033
I don't know
what happened.

43
00:02:33,103 --> 00:02:35,037
Somewhere along the way,
I screwed up.

44
00:02:35,105 --> 00:02:36,595
Either in high school
or college

45
00:02:36,673 --> 00:02:38,106
or my early twenties.

46
00:02:38,174 --> 00:02:40,301
I mean, you know, I really
thought, hey, this is a snap.

47
00:02:40,376 --> 00:02:42,606
I like men. Men like me.

48
00:02:42,679 --> 00:02:43,941
But then somewhere
in the last year or so,

49
00:02:44,013 --> 00:02:45,913
I just... I've just gotten
so screwed up.

50
00:02:45,982 --> 00:02:47,609
This might not make
any sense to you, Darce.

51
00:02:47,684 --> 00:02:49,117
I mean,
you've been married

52
00:02:49,185 --> 00:02:50,618
since you got
out of college.

53
00:02:50,687 --> 00:02:52,314
I was born married,
baby.

54
00:02:52,388 --> 00:02:54,117
But I think I'm finally
coming to realize

55
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:55,623
I like being single,
you know?

56
00:02:55,692 --> 00:02:57,125
Love being
self-sufficient.

57
00:02:57,193 --> 00:02:58,626
And I truly believe

58
00:02:58,695 --> 00:03:00,060
that this is
my nature, you know?

59
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:01,563
So what I'm
going to do is

60
00:03:01,631 --> 00:03:03,064
I'm just taking myself
out of the game.

61
00:03:03,133 --> 00:03:04,566
Put my mother
out of her misery,

62
00:03:04,634 --> 00:03:06,067
put me
out of my misery.

63
00:03:06,136 --> 00:03:07,569
Why are you looking
at me like that?

64
00:03:07,637 --> 00:03:08,569
Sorry. Let me
understand this.

65
00:03:08,638 --> 00:03:09,570
So if Sam
asked you out-

66
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:10,606
Darcy! Shh!

67
00:03:10,673 --> 00:03:12,072
You would just say,
"No, Sam."

68
00:03:12,142 --> 00:03:13,575
What are you doing?
He works here!

69
00:03:13,643 --> 00:03:15,076
Do you want him
to hear you?

70
00:03:15,145 --> 00:03:16,077
Sam. Sam.

71
00:03:16,146 --> 00:03:17,078
Shut up.

72
00:03:17,147 --> 00:03:18,079
Sam. Sam.

73
00:03:18,148 --> 00:03:19,080
Shut up. Shut up.

74
00:03:19,149 --> 00:03:21,083
Oh, hit me. Hit me.
I love it, Sam.

75
00:03:21,151 --> 00:03:22,243
Oh, God. You are
unbelievable.

76
00:03:38,668 --> 00:03:41,831
Okay, kids.

77
00:03:41,905 --> 00:03:47,605
Gulden's mustard has traditionally been
the number two mustard in America.

78
00:03:47,677 --> 00:03:50,612
What the Gulden's people are
looking for is increased sampling.

79
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:54,138
They're convinced that if they can
get people to try their product,

80
00:03:54,217 --> 00:03:56,151
they'll keep on using it.

81
00:03:56,219 --> 00:03:59,120
Three other agencies
in addition to ours

82
00:03:59,189 --> 00:04:02,056
have been invited to participate
in the review.

83
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:04,559
The pitch is on Friday...

84
00:04:04,627 --> 00:04:08,563
and we don't leave this room
until we're solid on a concept.

85
00:04:14,137 --> 00:04:15,365
You have
a good night now.

86
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:16,564
Yeah, you, too.

87
00:04:52,175 --> 00:04:55,110
Ahem. Um...

88
00:04:55,178 --> 00:04:59,114
Didn't Cindy Crawford
graduate second in her class?

89
00:04:59,182 --> 00:05:01,548
Did Cindy Crawford
graduate?

90
00:05:01,618 --> 00:05:03,552
I think she did.
Second in her class.

91
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,212
In biochemistry, I think.

92
00:05:05,288 --> 00:05:07,222
Excuse me?

93
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:09,850
Please. My friend-
my colleague-is having an epiphany.

94
00:05:09,926 --> 00:05:11,120
Oh.

95
00:05:11,194 --> 00:05:12,957
Okay.

96
00:05:13,029 --> 00:05:14,929
Um, I'll...

97
00:05:14,998 --> 00:05:17,933
I'll, uh, I'll give you
the print first.

98
00:05:18,001 --> 00:05:19,798
Um, okay. Big picture
of Cindy Crawford.

99
00:05:19,869 --> 00:05:21,302
Already
this is good.

100
00:05:21,371 --> 00:05:25,068
The headline reads "If you
never gave number two a try,

101
00:05:25,141 --> 00:05:27,075
think what
you'd be missing."

102
00:05:27,143 --> 00:05:28,576
In comes a picture of Cindy,

103
00:05:28,645 --> 00:05:30,977
and beneath that,
a little log line that says,

104
00:05:31,047 --> 00:05:33,538
"Cindy Crawford graduated
second from Podunk University,

105
00:05:33,616 --> 00:05:34,947
a B.S. In biochemistry."

106
00:05:35,018 --> 00:05:38,078
Then on the facing page,
a beauty shot of Gulden's mustard.

107
00:05:38,154 --> 00:05:40,588
And beneath that
in big letters,

108
00:05:40,657 --> 00:05:45,594
"Gulden's mustard. Number two,
and that ain't bad."

109
00:05:47,163 --> 00:05:49,097
That was impressive.

110
00:05:49,165 --> 00:05:51,099
I have to tell you.

111
00:05:51,167 --> 00:05:53,101
I could hardly keep
my legs together.

112
00:05:53,169 --> 00:05:54,602
You were so-

113
00:05:54,671 --> 00:05:56,104
Darce?

114
00:05:56,172 --> 00:05:57,605
I want that.

115
00:05:57,674 --> 00:05:59,608
Well, we all want that.

116
00:05:59,676 --> 00:06:01,541
No, I mean I want that.
You know what I mean?

117
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:05,047
I want a billboard in the middle
of Times Square, okay?

118
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:07,548
I want... I want
a commercial

119
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:09,050
in the middle of
the Academy Awards,

120
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:13,054
and I want a 10-page
layout in Vanity Fair.

121
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:15,556
And that's...
that's what I want.

122
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,058
Yeah, me, too.

123
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:19,560
God, we're shallow.

124
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:20,561
Argh!

125
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,154
Ha ha ha!

126
00:06:22,231 --> 00:06:24,597
I am making money

127
00:06:24,667 --> 00:06:26,464
I am loaded

128
00:06:26,536 --> 00:06:28,060
Well, your day
is coming soon.

129
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:30,298
They're going to give you
an account of your own

130
00:06:30,373 --> 00:06:32,341
and a window
and some new furniture.

131
00:06:32,408 --> 00:06:35,343
My furniture.
I like old furniture.

132
00:06:35,411 --> 00:06:37,072
Anyway, let me tell you
why I'm really here.

133
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:38,579
Oh, I know
why you're here.

134
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:40,582
I've been going over
my expense report,

135
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,083
and, uh,
I want to let you know,

136
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:43,584
in case anyone from
accounting should ask,

137
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:48,090
that I had dinner with you
on the ninth, on the 11th,

138
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:50,057
a humdinger on the 23rd,

139
00:06:50,126 --> 00:06:53,584
and a light lunch
yesterday, okay?

140
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:58,099
You know, I think I would really
feel a lot better about this

141
00:06:58,167 --> 00:07:00,362
if we actually did
have dinner onetime.

142
00:07:00,436 --> 00:07:01,801
I can't have dinner
with you, Kate.

143
00:07:01,871 --> 00:07:02,963
You know that.

144
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:03,971
I do?

145
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,268
Yes. Of course you do.

146
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:06,308
Do I know why?

147
00:07:06,376 --> 00:07:07,707
Yes, you know why.
We both know why.

148
00:07:07,777 --> 00:07:11,474
You're simply...
too nice.

149
00:07:11,547 --> 00:07:14,573
I think you're mistaken
about that, Sam.

150
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:16,242
I'm not.

151
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,186
I can be a bad girl,
Sam.

152
00:07:19,255 --> 00:07:21,485
Not bad enough for me,
Kate.

153
00:07:21,557 --> 00:07:22,785
Oh, really?

154
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:24,053
Truly.

155
00:07:24,127 --> 00:07:25,424
Uh!

156
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:29,564
Yes.

157
00:07:34,637 --> 00:07:36,070
Okay.

158
00:07:36,139 --> 00:07:38,266
All right. All right.
Let's get down to business-

159
00:07:38,341 --> 00:07:42,072
The business of servicing this
multimillion-dollar account.

160
00:07:42,145 --> 00:07:44,079
Our account executive
in charge-

161
00:07:44,147 --> 00:07:46,274
Darcy O'Neil.

162
00:07:46,349 --> 00:07:47,577
Yes!

163
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:49,083
Whoo!

164
00:07:49,152 --> 00:07:50,346
My girl!

165
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:52,354
And our creative team
is going to be headed up

166
00:07:52,422 --> 00:07:54,481
by my good friend Sela here.

167
00:07:56,159 --> 00:08:00,994
She has asked- She has asked
for Dominic, Nancy, and Jim to assist.

168
00:08:07,103 --> 00:08:09,037
Kate. Kate.

169
00:08:09,105 --> 00:08:10,538
Look, I'm sorry.
I don't mean to be rude.

170
00:08:10,606 --> 00:08:12,540
I just want to get
my resume Xeroxed

171
00:08:12,608 --> 00:08:14,041
before all this
healthy rage wears off.

172
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:15,543
Kate.

173
00:08:15,611 --> 00:08:17,135
Kate? Look, Kate.

174
00:08:17,213 --> 00:08:21,115
Look, I brought you to this agency,
and I'm glad I did.

175
00:08:21,184 --> 00:08:23,084
I know you conceived
that campaign.

176
00:08:23,152 --> 00:08:24,551
Let me talk to Mercer.
In fact, I'll get us a meeting

177
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:26,747
where the both of us
could talk to him.

178
00:08:26,823 --> 00:08:29,883
Kate, I'm going to
talk to him. I am.

179
00:08:31,127 --> 00:08:32,822
You have that wedding
this weekend, right?

180
00:08:32,895 --> 00:08:34,055
Yeah.

181
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:35,563
Okay, then.
Just do me a favor

182
00:08:35,631 --> 00:08:37,963
and please let me try
and make this right.

183
00:08:38,034 --> 00:08:39,467
Enjoy the weekend.

184
00:08:39,535 --> 00:08:41,059
I'll see you bright
and early on Monday, okay?

185
00:08:41,137 --> 00:08:42,570
Sure.

186
00:08:44,474 --> 00:08:47,272
You see that one
at Libby's station?

187
00:08:47,343 --> 00:08:48,776
She's marrying
a chiropodist.

188
00:08:48,845 --> 00:08:50,278
God's no fool.

189
00:08:50,346 --> 00:08:52,075
He gave her bad feet
for a reason.

190
00:08:52,148 --> 00:08:53,581
No. You know, maybe
that's my problem.

191
00:08:53,649 --> 00:08:55,583
Maybe I'm just
too damned healthy.

192
00:08:55,651 --> 00:08:58,085
I'm serious.
I bet there's an ob-gyn out there

193
00:08:58,154 --> 00:09:01,521
who's just waiting for me to come
walking into his office, you know?

194
00:09:01,591 --> 00:09:03,354
That would explain all those
damn yeast infections,

195
00:09:03,426 --> 00:09:04,518
don't you think?

196
00:09:04,594 --> 00:09:07,028
Don't be a smart ass,
and watch your mouth.

197
00:09:07,096 --> 00:09:08,529
This is a place
of business.

198
00:09:08,598 --> 00:09:11,897
You know who I met
at the supermarket the other day?

199
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:13,060
Who?

200
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:15,035
Mark Mclntyre. Whatever
happened with him, hmm?

201
00:09:15,104 --> 00:09:16,537
He's gay, Ma.

202
00:09:16,606 --> 00:09:18,039
So?

203
00:09:18,107 --> 00:09:19,039
Oh.

204
00:09:19,108 --> 00:09:20,541
Well, what are you
making faces?

205
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:22,043
You think I don't know
I sound neurotic?

206
00:09:22,111 --> 00:09:23,544
I know.
I can hear myself.

207
00:09:25,615 --> 00:09:28,550
I'd like a grandchild.

208
00:09:28,618 --> 00:09:30,051
So...

209
00:09:30,119 --> 00:09:31,552
Shoot me.

210
00:09:31,621 --> 00:09:33,555
All right, Ma.
Well, you'll be happy to know

211
00:09:33,623 --> 00:09:35,557
I'm looking into
getting some eggs frozen.

212
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:38,560
Wonderful. I can tell everyone
I'm having a grandsicle, hmm?

213
00:09:38,628 --> 00:09:41,062
Ha ha! Oh, come on, now.
That was good.

214
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:43,564
Well, it was cute.
It was definitely clever.

215
00:09:43,633 --> 00:09:46,568
Okay. Any idea what we're planning
up here with these rollers?

216
00:09:46,636 --> 00:09:49,571
Well, for once I want your hair
out of your eyes.

217
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:54,076
I want your eyes and your
ears open at this wedding.

218
00:09:54,143 --> 00:09:59,080
A wedding is a wonderful
place to meet new people.

219
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:16,655
As the power vested in me
by the state of New York,

220
00:10:16,732 --> 00:10:22,102
I now pronounce you, Sajit,
and you, Susan, as man and wife.

221
00:10:22,171 --> 00:10:24,605
You may kiss the bride, please.

222
00:10:33,649 --> 00:10:35,640
K.C. & The Sunshine Band:
Do a little dance

223
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:37,583
Make a little love

224
00:10:37,653 --> 00:10:41,984
Get down tonight

225
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:44,390
Do a little dance

226
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,155
Make a little love

227
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:50,526
Get down tonight

228
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,899
Get down, get down,
get down, get down

229
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:56,200
Get down tonight, baby

230
00:10:56,272 --> 00:10:59,036
Woowoowoowoo
woowoowoowoo

231
00:10:59,108 --> 00:11:02,373
Get down, get down,
get down, get down

232
00:11:02,445 --> 00:11:04,572
Get down tonight, baby

233
00:11:04,647 --> 00:11:07,582
Nah nah nah nah nah
nah nah nah nah nah

234
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:10,585
Oh. Hi.

235
00:11:12,655 --> 00:11:13,587
Hi.

236
00:11:13,656 --> 00:11:14,588
Hello.
How are you?

237
00:11:14,657 --> 00:11:15,589
Hello.

238
00:11:15,658 --> 00:11:17,091
Woman Over P A: Hello, everybody.

239
00:11:20,162 --> 00:11:24,599
Thank you all for coming
and for being a part of

240
00:11:24,667 --> 00:11:28,603
this very special
wedding celebration.

241
00:11:28,671 --> 00:11:32,107
Sajit and I really wanted today
to be unique.

242
00:11:32,174 --> 00:11:33,664
One new thing.

243
00:11:33,743 --> 00:11:36,678
Uh, in the center of each table,

244
00:11:36,746 --> 00:11:41,479
you'll find a Polaroid camera
and boxes of film.

245
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:43,814
They're there because
we want all of you

246
00:11:43,886 --> 00:11:47,185
to be our wedding photographers.

247
00:11:47,256 --> 00:11:52,091
Feel free to keep any pictures
you want or give them to us

248
00:11:52,161 --> 00:11:53,685
or to other guests.

249
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:57,991
Whoo!

250
00:11:58,067 --> 00:12:00,126
That's the idea.

251
00:12:00,202 --> 00:12:04,662
Dion: Yeah, I should have known it
from the very start

252
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:07,208
This girl will leave me
with a broken heart

253
00:12:07,276 --> 00:12:10,609
Now listen people
what I'm telling you

254
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:13,080
A- keep away
from a Runaround Sue

255
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:16,778
Yeah, I miss her lips
and the smile on her face

256
00:12:16,852 --> 00:12:19,343
The touch of her hair
and this girl's warm embrace

257
00:12:19,422 --> 00:12:22,448
So if you don't wanna cry
like I do

258
00:12:22,525 --> 00:12:25,460
A- keep away
from a Runaround Sue

259
00:12:25,528 --> 00:12:27,996
Whoa...

260
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:32,794
Susan's
single friend Kate?

261
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:36,138
Excuse me?

262
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:39,106
I'm sorry. I'm Nick.

263
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:40,608
I'm looking for Susan's
single friend Kate.

264
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:42,109
They told me they thought she
came out here.

265
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:44,112
Yeah. That's me.

266
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,613
Can I help you?

267
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:47,546
Don't you think that's,
uh, kind of strange

268
00:12:47,616 --> 00:12:49,311
that she only has
one friend?

269
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:54,622
Ahem. Okay. Uh...
basically what I'm doing

270
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:58,126
is, uh, putting together a video
testimonial for Susan and Sajit.

271
00:12:58,194 --> 00:12:59,627
Just, you know,
all their friends

272
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:01,094
wishing them the best
of everything,

273
00:13:01,163 --> 00:13:04,690
eternal bliss, truckloads of happiness,
et cetera, et cetera.

274
00:13:04,767 --> 00:13:06,098
Do you do this
for a living?

275
00:13:06,168 --> 00:13:07,601
Videotape weddings?
Yeah.

276
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:09,069
Bar mitzvahs, too.

277
00:13:09,138 --> 00:13:11,072
But, uh, in this case
it's kind of strange

278
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:13,074
because I'm also
Sajit's best friend,

279
00:13:13,142 --> 00:13:15,576
so I'm sort of
a working guest.

280
00:13:15,644 --> 00:13:17,077
You know,
pulling double duty.

281
00:13:17,146 --> 00:13:18,078
Mm-hmm.

282
00:13:18,147 --> 00:13:20,081
All right. You're on.

283
00:13:20,149 --> 00:13:22,083
Oh. Wow. That was fast.

284
00:13:22,151 --> 00:13:23,584
Um, okay.

285
00:13:24,653 --> 00:13:26,587
Hi, Susan. Hi, Sajit.

286
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:28,418
Uh, congratulations.

287
00:13:28,491 --> 00:13:32,427
Just have a great time.
Call me when you get back, and, um...

288
00:13:32,495 --> 00:13:35,931
Oh, and if you see
a really big gift,

289
00:13:35,998 --> 00:13:38,592
really expensive gift
with no card,

290
00:13:38,667 --> 00:13:40,100
it's mine.

291
00:13:40,169 --> 00:13:41,602
My gift to you.

292
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:43,103
Okay. Um, that's all.

293
00:13:43,172 --> 00:13:46,608
So have a wonderful time,
and I'll see you when you get back.

294
00:13:46,675 --> 00:13:47,607
Bye.

295
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:54,115
Okay. Can... Can you
cut it now?

296
00:13:54,183 --> 00:13:57,751
Cut it.

297
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:58,752
What?

298
00:13:58,821 --> 00:13:59,753
Cut it.

299
00:13:59,822 --> 00:14:00,811
Oh. I'm sorry.

300
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:02,050
You've done
this before, huh?

301
00:14:02,124 --> 00:14:03,056
Oh, yeah.

302
00:14:06,495 --> 00:14:08,053
Whoo!

303
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:09,563
Well, so, uh, I gotta
get back inside.

304
00:14:09,632 --> 00:14:11,566
The bunny hop's coming up,
and I have to shoot that.

305
00:14:11,634 --> 00:14:12,566
Okay.

306
00:14:12,635 --> 00:14:13,567
It's contractual.

307
00:14:13,636 --> 00:14:14,796
All right.

308
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:16,064
Kate? Nick.

309
00:14:16,138 --> 00:14:17,571
Good to meet you,
Nick.

310
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,800
You bunny hop?

311
00:14:18,874 --> 00:14:20,068
No.

312
00:14:20,142 --> 00:14:21,439
All right.
I'll see you later.

313
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:29,584
You're horny, huh?

314
00:14:29,652 --> 00:14:31,347
Yeah, I hear you.

315
00:14:39,195 --> 00:14:41,060
Yeah!

316
00:14:46,235 --> 00:14:48,100
Yes!

317
00:14:53,676 --> 00:14:55,075
Okay!

318
00:14:56,679 --> 00:14:59,147
All you single women...

319
00:14:59,215 --> 00:15:02,548
come on out here
and try to catch the bouquet!

320
00:15:02,618 --> 00:15:04,051
You going
to go out there?

321
00:15:04,119 --> 00:15:05,916
Uh-uh. I've been
married once. No, thanks.

322
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:06,920
Okay.

323
00:15:08,858 --> 00:15:11,224
Get out there. Come on.
Yes, yes, yes. It'll be fun. Go.

324
00:15:23,138 --> 00:15:24,070
Ahem.

325
00:15:26,141 --> 00:15:28,075
Okay. Just give me
the damn thing.

326
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:31,569
Oh, no, no.

327
00:15:31,647 --> 00:15:34,377
Captain And Tennille:
Love will keep us together

328
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:37,977
Think of me, babe, whenever

329
00:15:38,053 --> 00:15:41,682
Some sweet-talking girl
comes along

330
00:15:41,757 --> 00:15:43,554
Singing a song

331
00:15:43,626 --> 00:15:47,062
Don't mess around,
you just gotta be strong

332
00:15:47,129 --> 00:15:48,858
Just stop

333
00:15:48,931 --> 00:15:51,126
'Cause I really love you

334
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,360
Stop

335
00:15:52,434 --> 00:15:54,664
I've been thinking of you

336
00:15:54,737 --> 00:16:01,411
Look in my heart and let love
keep us together

337
00:16:04,113 --> 00:16:06,946
He's cute.

338
00:16:07,016 --> 00:16:08,449
So here's the deal.

339
00:16:08,518 --> 00:16:10,452
Mercer?
Yeah, he likes you,

340
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:13,546
but he's got a real point of view
about your career path.

341
00:16:13,623 --> 00:16:15,557
So just, you know,
let him get that out of the way,

342
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:16,557
and then-

343
00:16:16,626 --> 00:16:18,059
All right. Just relax.

344
00:16:18,127 --> 00:16:19,560
Trust me.

345
00:16:19,629 --> 00:16:21,062
I'm a little nervous.

346
00:16:24,634 --> 00:16:27,568
Hi.

347
00:16:27,637 --> 00:16:29,070
- Hi.
- Hi, Mr. Mercer.

348
00:16:29,138 --> 00:16:31,072
Thanks for taking
time to speak with me.

349
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:33,574
Not a problem.
Not a problem.

350
00:16:33,643 --> 00:16:35,975
We're meeting some clients for lunch
downstairs in about 20 minutes,

351
00:16:36,045 --> 00:16:37,569
so I'm going to get right to
the point here, Katherine.

352
00:16:37,647 --> 00:16:39,171
Uh, Kate.

353
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:42,581
Kate. Uh, you know, I think you're
doing a hell of a job for us, Kate.

354
00:16:42,652 --> 00:16:45,587
And I'm sorry if your role at the agency
isn't all you hoped it would be,

355
00:16:45,655 --> 00:16:47,623
but, uh, you know,
I suspect in time-

356
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:49,783
What if I don't
want to wait?

357
00:16:49,859 --> 00:16:51,292
Hey. It's me.

358
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,590
I mean, I think I'm
good at what I do.

359
00:16:53,663 --> 00:16:56,154
Obviously
the clients agree.

360
00:16:56,232 --> 00:16:58,860
I mean, otherwise we wouldn't be
landing all these accounts.

361
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:03,538
Um, let me tell you
a little story, okay?

362
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:05,039
When I started out
in advertising-

363
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:07,439
We're talking
the early seventies here.

364
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:09,535
The long beard, long hair,
and all that stuff.

365
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:14,549
And like you, I felt that my talents and
my hard work weren't being appreciated.

366
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:17,552
Anyway, I finally get
my 10 minutes with the boss,

367
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:22,057
and he says to me, "Alan, in business
we dress for the job we want,

368
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:25,355
not the job we have. Do you
really want to be the janitor? '

369
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:29,063
What do you want
to be, Kate?

370
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:33,999
I don't understand.

371
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:36,004
Well, look at Darcy here.

372
00:17:36,072 --> 00:17:39,564
Now, you two are the same age,
but Darcy owns a home-

373
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:41,633
a home that, in my opinion,
she can't really afford-

374
00:17:41,711 --> 00:17:44,145
and that pleases me no end

375
00:17:44,213 --> 00:17:47,114
because I know she's showing up
for work tomorrow.

376
00:17:47,183 --> 00:17:48,616
And this guy,

377
00:17:48,684 --> 00:17:50,584
I co-signed the loan
on his Mercedes.

378
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:52,086
Happy to do it.

379
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:53,587
He's not going anywhere.

380
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:54,588
Sela here...

381
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:56,591
Oh, yeah.
I've got it all:

382
00:17:56,659 --> 00:17:58,092
The husband,
the house,

383
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,593
and the car
we can't afford.

384
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:01,527
Which brings us to you.

385
00:18:01,597 --> 00:18:04,031
Now, unlike anyone else
who works for me,

386
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,864
you're the only person I know who lives
like they're still in college.

387
00:18:06,936 --> 00:18:09,530
I mean, you're, uh, you know,
you're as free as a bird,

388
00:18:09,605 --> 00:18:10,799
which is fine...

389
00:18:10,873 --> 00:18:12,738
for you.

390
00:18:12,808 --> 00:18:17,404
But I'm not about to encourage you to develop
a relationship with one of my largest clients

391
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:20,540
when I know there's nothing
keeping you from picking up

392
00:18:20,616 --> 00:18:22,243
and going to work
for one of my competitors

393
00:18:22,318 --> 00:18:26,152
and maybe taking
my big client with you.

394
00:18:30,126 --> 00:18:31,650
Ahem.

395
00:18:31,727 --> 00:18:33,718
Anybody care for a drink?

396
00:18:33,796 --> 00:18:35,730
Shit. Shit.

397
00:18:35,798 --> 00:18:38,562
Shit! Shit!
The world's shit!

398
00:18:38,634 --> 00:18:41,068
Shit! Shit!
Shit! Shit! Shit!

399
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:47,002
Shit.

400
00:18:47,076 --> 00:18:49,840
Oh, God. Ma'am, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I...

401
00:18:51,147 --> 00:18:52,580
Oh, God.

402
00:18:52,648 --> 00:18:53,580
Oh, shit.

403
00:18:53,649 --> 00:18:55,082
Oh, God. Okay.

404
00:18:55,151 --> 00:18:56,209
Okay.

405
00:18:56,285 --> 00:18:57,582
Okay. Okay. Okay.

406
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:07,425
Well, Mercer told me to tell you,
"Welcome to the team."

407
00:19:07,496 --> 00:19:09,293
What team?

408
00:19:09,365 --> 00:19:12,857
Uh, team Gulden's.
The Gulden's team.

409
00:19:12,935 --> 00:19:16,098
But I don't have a husband,
and I don't have a mortgage,

410
00:19:16,172 --> 00:19:19,369
and I don't have a car
manufactured by a goddamn Nazi.

411
00:19:19,442 --> 00:19:21,603
Oh, jeez,
wait a second.

412
00:19:21,677 --> 00:19:25,272
You mean you're not
engaged to this guy?

413
00:19:25,348 --> 00:19:27,248
Oh, what are you
talking about?

414
00:19:27,316 --> 00:19:29,045
Darcy,
what did you do?

415
00:19:29,118 --> 00:19:31,143
What did you do?
What did you do?!

416
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:32,619
Me? Nothing much.

417
00:19:32,688 --> 00:19:35,384
I just got you 150 more a week
and a new job title.

418
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:36,925
You lied?!

419
00:19:36,993 --> 00:19:38,790
Darcy, I earned
that promotion!

420
00:19:38,861 --> 00:19:40,294
I deserved
that promotion.

421
00:19:40,363 --> 00:19:42,297
Boy, are you in
the wrong profession.

422
00:19:42,365 --> 00:19:44,595
We're in advertising, Kate.
I didn't lie. I sold.

423
00:19:44,667 --> 00:19:46,498
Oh, God,
I got to sit down.

424
00:19:46,569 --> 00:19:48,867
I told him you were too proud
to mention it yourself.

425
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:51,133
They all said they want
to meet him, of course.

426
00:19:51,207 --> 00:19:52,799
Oh, great. Oh, my God.

427
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:55,400
That's my first chest pain.
That's my first official chest pain.

428
00:19:55,478 --> 00:19:56,809
Oh, relax.

429
00:19:56,879 --> 00:19:59,848
I mean, they don't really.
And by the way, if anyone asks,

430
00:19:59,915 --> 00:20:02,850
he lives in Boston, and he flies in
every Friday on the shuttle.

431
00:20:02,918 --> 00:20:04,351
Oh, Darcy!

432
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:07,321
Well, he has to.
You're house hunting.

433
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:10,416
House hunting? I'm not even
married to the guy yet.

434
00:20:10,493 --> 00:20:13,690
You will be... in March.
You wanted a spring wedding.

435
00:20:13,763 --> 00:20:15,390
And also, I figure
it gives you 9 months

436
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:17,091
until you have
to break it off.

437
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:19,293
And who knows? I could throw you
a little shower.

438
00:20:19,368 --> 00:20:21,427
You could score
some pretty nice gifts.

439
00:20:21,504 --> 00:20:24,200
God, I can't believe you did this to me.
To me, your friend.

440
00:20:24,273 --> 00:20:26,173
Well, excuse me
for changing your life.

441
00:20:26,242 --> 00:20:28,403
I didn't do it to you,
I did it for you.

442
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:30,604
And only because I knew you'd never
work up the courage

443
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,307
to do it for yourself.

444
00:20:32,381 --> 00:20:34,349
Courage? To what?
To lie?

445
00:20:34,417 --> 00:20:36,942
What about my work?
What about my talent?

446
00:20:37,019 --> 00:20:38,452
What about my-

447
00:20:38,521 --> 00:20:39,954
What about
your integrity?

448
00:20:40,022 --> 00:20:42,616
Your Girl Scout
code of ethics?

449
00:20:42,692 --> 00:20:44,159
What?

450
00:20:44,226 --> 00:20:47,127
Kate, you are a director of creative
affairs at Mercer Advertising.

451
00:20:47,196 --> 00:20:49,790
I told a little fib
to get you the gig.

452
00:20:49,865 --> 00:20:51,127
So what?

453
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,862
That doesn't change
the fact that you deserve it.

454
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:00,073
Oh, by the way,

455
00:21:00,142 --> 00:21:02,372
there's a reception for
the Gulden's people tomorrow night,

456
00:21:02,445 --> 00:21:04,538
and Mercer asked me
to ask you to be there.

457
00:21:04,613 --> 00:21:08,276
He also asked me
if you owned any nice dresses

458
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,648
he hadn't already
seen at work.

459
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,153
What does that mean?

460
00:21:12,221 --> 00:21:14,587
It means
buy a new dress, Kate.

461
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:24,963
What?

462
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:30,035
Hey, hey, hey!
Congratulations!

463
00:21:30,106 --> 00:21:32,472
Congratulations,
congratulations!

464
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,941
Oh, thank you.
Yeah, thank you.

465
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:37,240
Hey, Jesus Christ, Kate.
You know, you're breaking my heart.

466
00:21:37,313 --> 00:21:38,746
I never even
got my shot.

467
00:21:38,814 --> 00:21:39,872
Oh, come on.
You're married.

468
00:21:39,949 --> 00:21:41,644
I would have left her for you.
You know that.

469
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:43,344
So what
does he do?

470
00:21:43,419 --> 00:21:44,818
Um... videos.

471
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:48,015
What do you mean?
Like, music videos?

472
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:51,116
Yeah, sure.
Sometimes there's music in them.

473
00:21:51,193 --> 00:21:53,126
Really?

474
00:21:53,195 --> 00:21:54,457
Wow.
So happy for you.

475
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:55,656
I'm happier.

476
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:57,926
Thank you. That's
very nice, you guys.

477
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,230
Okay, I'll see you later.
I'm a little late.

478
00:22:00,302 --> 00:22:01,530
Videos. Crap.

479
00:22:01,604 --> 00:22:02,866
I give them two years.

480
00:22:02,938 --> 00:22:04,200
18 months, tops.

481
00:22:16,652 --> 00:22:19,587
Now, it's a fruitful acre...

482
00:22:21,957 --> 00:22:24,858
Gotto cross
the mighty river

483
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:27,122
And you got
to get along

484
00:22:27,196 --> 00:22:28,925
And I'm singing

485
00:22:28,998 --> 00:22:33,935
Oh, I got to keep
from goin' down

486
00:22:34,003 --> 00:22:38,963
Oh, though I don't know
where I'm bound

487
00:22:39,041 --> 00:22:50,011
It's too late
to turn back around

488
00:22:51,187 --> 00:22:52,916
Hey!

489
00:22:52,988 --> 00:22:54,785
Ah! Wow!

490
00:22:54,857 --> 00:22:56,620
Have my baby?

491
00:22:56,692 --> 00:22:59,183
Okay. Something happened,
though, between the store and here.

492
00:22:59,261 --> 00:23:01,024
I really-
I had more dress.

493
00:23:01,096 --> 00:23:03,621
Believe me, the part that's left
looks amazing.

494
00:23:03,699 --> 00:23:05,360
Really? Oh, good.

495
00:23:05,434 --> 00:23:06,366
Well... cheers.

496
00:23:06,435 --> 00:23:07,868
Oh, thank you.

497
00:23:07,937 --> 00:23:09,529
Have fun.
You look beautiful.

498
00:23:09,605 --> 00:23:11,129
Thank you. So do you.

499
00:23:11,207 --> 00:23:12,697
Mingle. Mingle.

500
00:23:12,775 --> 00:23:14,402
I will. Whoop. Big mustard
right behind you.

501
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:15,500
Bye.

502
00:23:16,745 --> 00:23:17,939
Oh...

503
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:28,589
Jim Davenport,
Katherine Mosley.

504
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:29,817
Miss Mosley.

505
00:23:29,892 --> 00:23:31,154
Hello.

506
00:23:31,227 --> 00:23:33,388
Saw you walking across the room
in that fabulous dress.

507
00:23:33,462 --> 00:23:35,396
I asked Alan and
Sela who you were.

508
00:23:35,464 --> 00:23:37,591
They tell me you're the author
of this wonderful catch phrase

509
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:39,600
we'll be using
in our new campaign.

510
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:41,602
Oh, well.
Now, we work as a team,

511
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,160
and Sela is actually
our team leader.

512
00:23:43,239 --> 00:23:44,206
I'm just,
you know...

513
00:23:44,273 --> 00:23:45,433
Tell her yours.

514
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:47,065
Jim's come up with an idea
for another campaign,

515
00:23:47,142 --> 00:23:48,575
something we can
use down the road.

516
00:23:48,644 --> 00:23:50,111
Great.

517
00:23:50,179 --> 00:23:53,307
Well, just imagine
a big bowl of mustard...

518
00:23:53,382 --> 00:23:55,043
Gulden's mustard...

519
00:23:55,117 --> 00:23:57,244
and a model...
a beautiful model.

520
00:23:57,319 --> 00:23:59,014
And she's behind
the bowl of mustard...

521
00:23:59,088 --> 00:24:00,851
and I don't know if she
has to be nude or not.

522
00:24:00,923 --> 00:24:02,891
I mean, maybe she wouldn't
actually have to be nude,

523
00:24:02,958 --> 00:24:04,949
but because of the way
the bowl is in the picture

524
00:24:05,027 --> 00:24:07,052
and given the parts of the model
you would actually see,

525
00:24:07,129 --> 00:24:09,029
she would appear
to be nude.

526
00:24:09,098 --> 00:24:11,157
We'll leave
the technical stuff to you.

527
00:24:11,233 --> 00:24:14,327
Anyway, you've got this model
and a bowl of mustard,

528
00:24:14,403 --> 00:24:17,463
and in big letters across the top
of the picture

529
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:19,803
are just the words,
"Spread this."

530
00:24:22,044 --> 00:24:23,511
"Spread this."
I mean...

531
00:24:23,579 --> 00:24:25,171
What do you think?

532
00:24:29,985 --> 00:24:31,282
Um...

533
00:24:31,353 --> 00:24:32,684
I like it...

534
00:24:32,755 --> 00:24:34,586
because it has
so many meanings.

535
00:24:34,657 --> 00:24:37,285
Yeah. I mean,
can't you just see it?

536
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:40,328
In dorm rooms, posters,
on bumper stickers...

537
00:24:40,396 --> 00:24:42,557
Yeah, I sure-
I sure can.

538
00:24:42,631 --> 00:24:44,098
Ha ha!

539
00:24:44,166 --> 00:24:45,656
Oh, I mean,
you know...

540
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:47,929
I hear something
like that,

541
00:24:48,003 --> 00:24:51,962
and I actually... I actually
have a physical reaction.

542
00:24:52,041 --> 00:24:54,601
I mean, you know,

543
00:24:54,677 --> 00:24:58,078
how often can you say that
nowadays, you know?

544
00:24:58,147 --> 00:24:59,978
Not very damn often!

545
00:25:00,049 --> 00:25:01,641
Nope!

546
00:25:01,717 --> 00:25:04,686
Excuse me, please.
Pleasure to meet you.

547
00:25:05,788 --> 00:25:07,119
Well...

548
00:25:07,189 --> 00:25:09,384
She is terrific!

549
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:46,059
So, what's different?

550
00:25:47,363 --> 00:25:50,423
It's... It's the dress,
I'm telling you.

551
00:25:50,499 --> 00:25:53,195
No, it's not just the dress.
It's something else.

552
00:25:53,268 --> 00:25:54,292
It's...

553
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:56,133
I don't know.
Success?

554
00:25:56,205 --> 00:25:59,663
Or... it's like some part of you
that I've never seen before.

555
00:25:59,742 --> 00:26:01,539
Aren't we going
to get in trouble...

556
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:03,441
I mean, leaving
the party like we did?

557
00:26:03,512 --> 00:26:05,503
Oh, nobody's ever going to notice.
Are you kidding?

558
00:26:05,581 --> 00:26:07,481
The big guys are
all hammered anyway.

559
00:26:07,549 --> 00:26:09,540
The working stiffs
will be leaving soon

560
00:26:09,618 --> 00:26:11,552
to catch the 9:31
to Syosset.

561
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:13,053
Ha ha!

562
00:26:19,628 --> 00:26:21,152
I like you.

563
00:26:25,134 --> 00:26:26,396
Um...

564
00:26:28,137 --> 00:26:30,401
Okay.

565
00:26:32,307 --> 00:26:34,138
Oh, oh. This isn't me.

566
00:26:34,209 --> 00:26:36,473
I don't normally do this.
I don't know...

567
00:26:36,545 --> 00:26:38,945
I don't know if it's the wine,
maybe, or if it's the beer,

568
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:40,072
or it's...

569
00:26:40,149 --> 00:26:41,946
Me?

570
00:26:43,152 --> 00:26:44,813
Maybe.

571
00:26:55,664 --> 00:27:00,260
So, uh... so tell me
about this guy.

572
00:27:01,603 --> 00:27:02,570
Huh?

573
00:27:04,606 --> 00:27:06,039
The guy.

574
00:27:06,108 --> 00:27:08,542
You know, the guy
in the picture.

575
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:10,407
I know all about him.

576
00:27:12,314 --> 00:27:15,477
You are a bad girl.

577
00:27:26,095 --> 00:27:28,461
Hi, Mom? It's me.

578
00:27:31,133 --> 00:27:32,566
It's Kate.

579
00:27:32,634 --> 00:27:36,126
No. I just wanted
to call you for a change.

580
00:27:36,205 --> 00:27:37,137
Look...

581
00:27:39,141 --> 00:27:41,575
- Whispering?
- I'm not whispering.

582
00:27:43,645 --> 00:27:45,237
Nice work. Good.

583
00:27:47,149 --> 00:27:48,081
In here.

584
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:49,082
Si.

585
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,718
Nice view.

586
00:28:02,831 --> 00:28:04,298
Hi there.

587
00:28:04,366 --> 00:28:05,697
Bad time?

588
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:07,098
No.

589
00:28:07,169 --> 00:28:10,605
Um... guys, could I just
have one minute, please?

590
00:28:10,672 --> 00:28:12,105
Thank you.

591
00:28:22,618 --> 00:28:25,314
So I woke up this morning,
and you were gone,

592
00:28:25,387 --> 00:28:28,049
and it occurred to me
that I may have done

593
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:30,023
a really shitty
thing here.

594
00:28:30,092 --> 00:28:31,525
What do you mean?

595
00:28:31,593 --> 00:28:35,757
Well, I knew that you were involved
with this other person. Uh...

596
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:39,692
Nick. Yeah.

597
00:28:39,768 --> 00:28:41,702
I'm supposed to be
your friend here.

598
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:43,601
I feel-I feel
responsible.

599
00:28:43,672 --> 00:28:46,197
Listen, Sam... I mean,
don't beat yourself up

600
00:28:46,275 --> 00:28:48,266
about this whole thing,
you know?

601
00:28:48,343 --> 00:28:50,072
I mean, I'm a big girl.

602
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:51,169
I know.

603
00:28:51,246 --> 00:28:52,213
You know?

604
00:28:53,649 --> 00:28:55,207
So what are we
going to do?

605
00:28:55,284 --> 00:28:56,717
- About?
- Nick.

606
00:28:56,785 --> 00:28:57,717
Oh.

607
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:01,918
Yeah. Um... I don't know.
I don't know.

608
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:04,788
What do you think
we should do?

609
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:07,294
Well, a lot of people
would tell you

610
00:29:07,362 --> 00:29:09,387
to be honest,
confess everything.

611
00:29:09,464 --> 00:29:11,455
I've had a lot of
experience with this.

612
00:29:11,533 --> 00:29:12,966
I think
that's just cruel.

613
00:29:13,035 --> 00:29:14,832
I mean, what good
is going to come of it?

614
00:29:14,903 --> 00:29:16,734
You're only going to
hurt someone's feelings.

615
00:29:16,805 --> 00:29:18,602
You can't take
the moment back.

616
00:29:18,674 --> 00:29:20,505
It's not like you can
turn back the clock.

617
00:29:20,576 --> 00:29:24,068
And it's... It's not like it's ever
going to happen again.

618
00:29:24,146 --> 00:29:25,773
Really?

619
00:29:28,116 --> 00:29:29,879
I mean, yeah. No.

620
00:29:29,952 --> 00:29:31,715
Yes, I know. No.

621
00:29:31,787 --> 00:29:33,220
Right.

622
00:29:33,288 --> 00:29:37,190
So maybe the less
Nick knows, the better.

623
00:29:37,259 --> 00:29:41,696
Yeah, yeah. I would- I think
I would be of that mind. Mm-hmm.

624
00:29:41,763 --> 00:29:42,923
Good.

625
00:29:42,998 --> 00:29:44,158
- Yeah. Great.
- Great.

626
00:29:44,233 --> 00:29:45,757
- Good.
- Great.

627
00:29:47,636 --> 00:29:48,830
Great.

628
00:29:53,075 --> 00:29:55,009
Have you ever been
to a tennis tournament?

629
00:29:55,077 --> 00:29:56,977
'Cause I got these two
tickets this weekend.

630
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:59,013
I mean, purely as a friend thing,
if you wanted to-

631
00:29:59,081 --> 00:30:01,106
Well, that's-

632
00:30:01,183 --> 00:30:03,083
That's very sweet, Sam,

633
00:30:03,151 --> 00:30:05,676
and I would love to,
as a friend thing,

634
00:30:05,754 --> 00:30:08,518
but, uh, you see,
the thing is...

635
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:11,218
Nick's coming
into town this weekend.

636
00:30:11,293 --> 00:30:12,692
Right, right, right.

637
00:30:12,761 --> 00:30:14,092
Right, okay.

638
00:30:14,162 --> 00:30:15,220
Right.

639
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:17,956
Hey.

640
00:30:18,033 --> 00:30:19,091
Yeah.

641
00:30:19,167 --> 00:30:20,759
Nick's a lucky guy.

642
00:30:20,836 --> 00:30:22,030
You think so?

643
00:30:22,104 --> 00:30:23,594
I do.

644
00:30:30,045 --> 00:30:31,569
Oh...

645
00:30:31,647 --> 00:30:32,978
God.

646
00:30:48,697 --> 00:30:50,130
Oh! Ma!
Jesus F-ing Christ!

647
00:30:50,198 --> 00:30:51,631
I did not go through
3 hours of labor-

648
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,133
not to mention 81/2 years
with your father-

649
00:30:53,201 --> 00:30:54,634
Why do you
do this to me?

650
00:30:54,703 --> 00:30:56,136
So that I could spend
my days worrying...

651
00:30:56,204 --> 00:30:57,796
Can't I just
put my stuff down?

652
00:30:57,873 --> 00:30:59,033
Whether my daughter was lying in
some ditch somewhere or something worse!

653
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:00,301
Ditch?! Mom,
listen to yourself!

654
00:31:00,375 --> 00:31:01,967
There are no goddamn
ditches in New York!

655
00:31:02,044 --> 00:31:04,171
Don't you raise
your voice to me, young lady!

656
00:31:04,246 --> 00:31:06,612
You want all
the neighbors to hear?

657
00:31:06,682 --> 00:31:09,845
My neighbors, Mother. This is
my apartment. What are you doing here?

658
00:31:09,918 --> 00:31:11,579
Let me ask you
a question.

659
00:31:11,653 --> 00:31:13,086
No! You answer
my question!

660
00:31:13,155 --> 00:31:15,089
Do I look stupid
to you?

661
00:31:15,157 --> 00:31:16,988
Stup-what? What is that
supposed to mean, Ma?

662
00:31:17,059 --> 00:31:18,583
"Hi, Mom.
It's me, Kate.

663
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:20,355
I just thought I'd call you
this morning for a change."

664
00:31:20,429 --> 00:31:21,862
Check your
answering machine.

665
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:25,127
The moment we hung up,
I called you back.

666
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:29,102
You weren't here. 7 times I tried.
7 times, young lady!

667
00:31:29,171 --> 00:31:31,105
So what?
No TV for a week?

668
00:31:31,173 --> 00:31:32,936
Then I phoned
the office,

669
00:31:33,008 --> 00:31:34,600
but apparently
Miss Big Shot

670
00:31:34,676 --> 00:31:36,610
was too busy to call
her mother back!

671
00:31:36,678 --> 00:31:39,112
Okay, you know what, though?
I'm here now, and I'm fine.

672
00:31:39,181 --> 00:31:40,648
Well, I'm not!

673
00:31:40,716 --> 00:31:42,684
And I want to know
where you were this morning!

674
00:31:42,751 --> 00:31:43,843
I have a right
to know!

675
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:45,409
No, you do not
have a right!

676
00:31:45,487 --> 00:31:46,419
You have no right,
Mother!

677
00:31:46,488 --> 00:31:47,819
I am 28 years old!

678
00:31:47,889 --> 00:31:50,221
Don't give me that.
I'm 54. I'm gonna be dead soon!

679
00:31:50,292 --> 00:31:51,452
Oh, God!

680
00:31:51,526 --> 00:31:52,686
Where are you going?

681
00:31:52,761 --> 00:31:54,126
To kill myself!

682
00:31:54,196 --> 00:31:55,322
No, no. Not until
you tell me

683
00:31:55,397 --> 00:31:57,627
where you were
this morning. No.

684
00:32:03,138 --> 00:32:06,471
All right, Mom.
I was with a man.

685
00:32:06,541 --> 00:32:10,068
I was with a really
beautiful man...

686
00:32:12,714 --> 00:32:14,648
who,
up until last night,

687
00:32:14,716 --> 00:32:16,183
never even noticed me.

688
00:32:16,251 --> 00:32:20,244
And then all of a sudden
he wanted to be with me,

689
00:32:20,322 --> 00:32:23,223
and I really wanted
to be with him...

690
00:32:23,291 --> 00:32:24,690
so we slept together.

691
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:28,594
We had sex, Mommy,
you know?

692
00:32:28,663 --> 00:32:30,597
The really dirty kind.

693
00:32:32,601 --> 00:32:35,069
And I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Mommy...

694
00:32:36,304 --> 00:32:39,535
But that's where I was.

695
00:32:40,742 --> 00:32:42,334
Oh, Kate.

696
00:32:44,179 --> 00:32:46,613
Now, that's enough
of that, hmm?

697
00:32:49,451 --> 00:32:51,612
Tell me the truth now.

698
00:32:53,355 --> 00:32:54,947
Oh, God.

699
00:32:55,023 --> 00:32:56,259
Mmm.

700
00:32:56,392 --> 00:32:58,189
And you know, the thing
that really kills me

701
00:32:58,261 --> 00:33:01,594
is she loved the lie so much better
than she liked the truth.

702
00:33:01,664 --> 00:33:03,825
I mean, even when I had to fudge
a little bit, you know?

703
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:05,127
"So, uh,
what does he do? '

704
00:33:05,201 --> 00:33:07,066
"Well, he owns
his own business."

705
00:33:07,136 --> 00:33:08,603
"Well, can I meet him
this weekend? '

706
00:33:08,671 --> 00:33:11,196
"Nope. We're going
ring shopping in Boston."

707
00:33:11,274 --> 00:33:12,502
Oh! Ring shopping.

708
00:33:12,575 --> 00:33:13,633
Yeah.

709
00:33:13,709 --> 00:33:14,767
Oh, you're really getting
the hang of this.

710
00:33:14,844 --> 00:33:17,711
I know. Well, it gets
easier once you realize

711
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:20,078
that's what everybody
wants you to do.

712
00:33:20,149 --> 00:33:23,550
Hi. Could I have the number for
Midtown Flowers, please?

713
00:33:23,619 --> 00:33:25,143
What are you doing?

714
00:33:25,221 --> 00:33:26,586
Ha ha! Thank you.

715
00:33:26,656 --> 00:33:30,717
Okay. "Press one
to connect this call."

716
00:33:30,793 --> 00:33:34,285
Yes, hi. I need to send
a huge bouquet

717
00:33:34,363 --> 00:33:39,460
to Katherine Mosley at Mercer
Advertising Agency. 555-96...

718
00:33:39,535 --> 00:33:40,763
Donna Summer: Bad girl

719
00:33:40,836 --> 00:33:42,463
Backup Singers: Bad girl

720
00:33:42,538 --> 00:33:45,234
Talkin' 'bout bad,
bad girls

721
00:33:45,308 --> 00:33:47,242
Yeah

722
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:48,242
Bad girl

723
00:33:48,311 --> 00:33:49,335
You bad girl

724
00:33:49,412 --> 00:33:51,346
You're such
a dirty bad girl

725
00:33:51,414 --> 00:33:52,642
Beep beep

726
00:33:52,715 --> 00:33:55,240
Uh-huh

727
00:33:55,318 --> 00:33:56,285
Hey, mister

728
00:33:57,386 --> 00:33:58,478
Beep beep

729
00:33:58,554 --> 00:34:00,920
Have you got a dime?

730
00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:03,481
Beep beep

731
00:34:03,559 --> 00:34:04,719
Mister

732
00:34:04,794 --> 00:34:06,056
Beep beep

733
00:34:06,128 --> 00:34:08,062
Do you want to
spend some time

734
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:09,062
Oh, yeah

735
00:34:09,131 --> 00:34:11,065
Beep beep

736
00:34:11,133 --> 00:34:12,122
Toot toot

737
00:34:12,201 --> 00:34:13,031
Hey, mister

738
00:34:13,102 --> 00:34:14,160
Beep beep

739
00:34:14,236 --> 00:34:16,932
I'll spend some time
with you

740
00:34:17,006 --> 00:34:18,872
Beep beep

741
00:34:18,941 --> 00:34:20,067
Can you...

742
00:34:22,645 --> 00:34:26,081
Hey, get your
hands off my stems.

743
00:34:26,148 --> 00:34:28,343
I've been waiting years
to use that line.

744
00:34:28,417 --> 00:34:29,441
So, what's
the occasion?

745
00:34:29,518 --> 00:34:31,645
Oh, come on, Sam.
You're smarter than that.

746
00:34:31,721 --> 00:34:35,521
You know there's only two reasons
why a man sends a woman flowers.

747
00:34:35,591 --> 00:34:37,320
I love it when I can
learn something new.

748
00:34:37,393 --> 00:34:39,486
Well, either
they've let you down,

749
00:34:39,562 --> 00:34:40,995
or they're about to.

750
00:34:41,063 --> 00:34:42,360
Nick?

751
00:34:42,431 --> 00:34:43,830
Mm-hmm.

752
00:34:43,899 --> 00:34:45,799
Nothing fatal,
I hope.

753
00:34:45,868 --> 00:34:48,701
No. He just has to
work this weekend.

754
00:34:49,772 --> 00:34:50,704
Ambition.

755
00:34:50,773 --> 00:34:52,798
I hate that
in a man.

756
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:58,408
Now, I'm quiet

757
00:34:58,481 --> 00:35:01,245
Quiet as a mouse could be

758
00:35:01,317 --> 00:35:03,308
But inside my head

759
00:35:03,386 --> 00:35:06,355
It's louder than a cavalry

760
00:35:06,422 --> 00:35:08,413
And I'm patient

761
00:35:08,491 --> 00:35:11,187
Patient as a clock

762
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:13,558
It is to feel the way

763
00:35:13,629 --> 00:35:15,790
When you're countin'
every tick and tock

764
00:35:15,865 --> 00:35:20,063
Show me how to
catch a fish

765
00:35:20,136 --> 00:35:23,367
Show

766
00:35:25,107 --> 00:35:27,632
Thanks for walking me
up here, Sam.

767
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:28,642
No problem.

768
00:35:28,711 --> 00:35:29,939
Oh, God,
I really had fun.

769
00:35:30,012 --> 00:35:31,570
I did.
I- you, uh...

770
00:35:31,647 --> 00:35:34,582
You really took
my mind off Nick.

771
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:38,552
Aw, come on.
We both know there is no Nick.

772
00:35:38,621 --> 00:35:40,987
There certainly
is a Nick.

773
00:35:41,056 --> 00:35:42,921
Not here.
Not now.

774
00:35:44,827 --> 00:35:46,351
What are you doing?

775
00:35:46,429 --> 00:35:49,091
This is called
mounting an offensive.

776
00:35:49,165 --> 00:35:50,689
Okay. Come on.

777
00:35:50,766 --> 00:35:52,597
Now, we know nobody's gonna be
mounting anybody around here.

778
00:35:52,668 --> 00:35:54,431
You're right. You're right.
Right. I'm sorry.

779
00:35:54,503 --> 00:35:55,527
All right?

780
00:35:55,604 --> 00:35:57,071
Can I just come in
for a glass of water?

781
00:35:57,139 --> 00:35:58,401
No.

782
00:35:58,474 --> 00:35:59,805
Well, can I come in
and pee?

783
00:35:59,875 --> 00:36:02,343
You just said you wanted
a glass of water.

784
00:36:02,411 --> 00:36:03,605
Oh, what can I say?

785
00:36:03,679 --> 00:36:05,874
The thought of drinking water
makes me have to pee.

786
00:36:05,948 --> 00:36:06,937
Come on.

787
00:36:07,016 --> 00:36:10,713
Sam, we have had
this conversation, okay?

788
00:36:10,786 --> 00:36:13,084
I'm engaged
to be married.

789
00:36:13,155 --> 00:36:14,884
We made this
mistake once.

790
00:36:14,957 --> 00:36:17,687
I cannot do it again.
I can't.

791
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:23,392
You know, I mean, God.
You know I like you. I can't deny that.

792
00:36:23,466 --> 00:36:26,629
But my heart
belongs to Nick.

793
00:36:26,702 --> 00:36:28,567
Okay?

794
00:36:28,637 --> 00:36:31,972
Okay.

795
00:36:32,041 --> 00:36:33,235
Thank you.

796
00:36:39,315 --> 00:36:40,304
Okay.

797
00:36:42,017 --> 00:36:43,507
Good night.

798
00:36:54,163 --> 00:36:56,222
Oh, there's steps,
there's steps, there's steps.

799
00:36:56,298 --> 00:36:58,425
It's over here.
Over here. Bedroom.

800
00:37:00,002 --> 00:37:02,835
Wow! Is this place
rent controlled?

801
00:37:02,905 --> 00:37:04,031
Ah!

802
00:37:10,946 --> 00:37:12,345
God,
you can't stay, Sam.

803
00:37:12,414 --> 00:37:13,540
Nick's gonna
call soon.

804
00:37:13,616 --> 00:37:15,015
I can be quiet.

805
00:37:15,084 --> 00:37:17,712
I can be really,
really quiet.

806
00:37:20,456 --> 00:37:23,425
The door.
I think you left the door open.

807
00:37:23,492 --> 00:37:25,050
No problem.

808
00:37:25,127 --> 00:37:30,622
Oh, I don't know, Sam.
It just feels wrong, you know?

809
00:37:30,699 --> 00:37:32,291
It just feels
really, really wrong.

810
00:37:32,368 --> 00:37:34,063
Ah!

811
00:37:34,136 --> 00:37:35,933
Well, good.

812
00:37:36,005 --> 00:37:37,939
'Cause that's
the feeling...

813
00:37:38,007 --> 00:37:39,406
that you feel...

814
00:37:39,475 --> 00:37:41,568
right before...

815
00:37:41,644 --> 00:37:44,704
it feels incredible.

816
00:37:56,158 --> 00:37:57,591
You know,

817
00:37:57,660 --> 00:38:03,792
normally this would be
about the time that I'd leave.

818
00:38:03,866 --> 00:38:06,357
Most of the women
I get involved with

819
00:38:06,435 --> 00:38:09,529
are either married
or have a boyfriend.

820
00:38:09,605 --> 00:38:13,041
It's always seemed to
work pretty well for me.

821
00:38:13,108 --> 00:38:15,542
You know,
the thing with that is

822
00:38:15,611 --> 00:38:18,341
that you always kind of
feel them looking past you,

823
00:38:18,414 --> 00:38:21,542
trying to steal
a glimpse of the clock

824
00:38:21,617 --> 00:38:25,553
or listening for a voice
on the answering machine.

825
00:38:25,621 --> 00:38:27,054
But you...

826
00:38:29,858 --> 00:38:32,827
I don't know.

827
00:38:32,895 --> 00:38:36,831
It's like,
even though you're engaged,

828
00:38:36,899 --> 00:38:40,027
when you're with me,

829
00:38:40,102 --> 00:38:43,071
I really feel like
you're with me, you know?

830
00:38:45,641 --> 00:38:48,576
You know what
the scary thing is?

831
00:38:48,644 --> 00:38:51,078
I actually
kind of like it.

832
00:38:57,152 --> 00:38:58,585
Are you asleep?

833
00:39:02,424 --> 00:39:03,356
Fabulous.

834
00:39:03,425 --> 00:39:05,017
My reputation
remains intact.

835
00:39:06,795 --> 00:39:08,956
Now, let me see
if I've got your story straight.

836
00:39:09,131 --> 00:39:12,965
It's Sunday night, you're
videotaping an out-of-town wedding,

837
00:39:13,035 --> 00:39:15,970
when suddenly
a fire alarm goes off.

838
00:39:16,038 --> 00:39:17,232
Everyone's evacuating,
but as you leave,

839
00:39:17,306 --> 00:39:19,297
you hear what sounds
like a child crying.

840
00:39:19,375 --> 00:39:22,242
You find a 6-year-old girl
by the vending machines.

841
00:39:22,311 --> 00:39:24,609
Now, you realize you're about to be
engulfed by flames.

842
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:27,012
So you take a chair.
You smash it through the window.

843
00:39:27,082 --> 00:39:29,175
With no firemen,
no nets below,

844
00:39:29,251 --> 00:39:32,118
you grab this little girl
and jump backwards out the window.

845
00:39:32,187 --> 00:39:33,484
Now, why backwards?

846
00:39:33,555 --> 00:39:35,819
Second I was hoping my body
would break her fall.

847
00:39:35,891 --> 00:39:37,552
What are you thinking
at that point?

848
00:39:37,626 --> 00:39:39,594
Well, honestly, I was thinking
I should get back inside,

849
00:39:39,662 --> 00:39:42,028
'Cause the bunny hop
was coming up...

850
00:39:42,097 --> 00:39:43,655
Aah!

851
00:39:43,732 --> 00:39:45,700
Well, you must-

852
00:39:45,768 --> 00:39:47,133
What?
What's up?

853
00:39:47,202 --> 00:39:48,567
...I mean, if an awning
broke my fall from 3 floors up.

854
00:39:48,637 --> 00:39:50,036
And the little girl?

855
00:39:50,105 --> 00:39:52,164
Oh, she's fine.
There's not a scratch on her.

856
00:39:52,241 --> 00:39:54,539
Hey, isn't
that your guy? Isn't that Nick?

857
00:39:54,610 --> 00:39:55,736
Uh-huh.

858
00:39:55,811 --> 00:39:58,371
Huh. Well, I guess we know
why he never called.

859
00:39:58,447 --> 00:39:59,607
All right, Nick.

860
00:39:59,682 --> 00:40:00,740
Thank you very much
for joining us this morning.

861
00:40:26,809 --> 00:40:29,107
Hey, Kate, I saw
your boyfriend on TV this morning.

862
00:40:29,178 --> 00:40:30,509
Hey, hey,
how about that?

863
00:40:30,579 --> 00:40:32,740
Also, your mother's
called 4 times already.

864
00:40:32,815 --> 00:40:33,907
Ah, I bet she has.

865
00:40:39,321 --> 00:40:41,755
Oh, well,
look at the bright side.

866
00:40:41,824 --> 00:40:43,291
At least he didn't make
the New York Times.

867
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:44,916
Yeah, right.
What the hell are we going to do?

868
00:40:44,993 --> 00:40:46,153
You okay?

869
00:40:46,228 --> 00:40:47,320
Uh-huh.

870
00:40:47,396 --> 00:40:48,090
Is he okay?

871
00:40:48,163 --> 00:40:49,130
Yeah.

872
00:40:49,198 --> 00:40:51,359
Of course he's okay.
He's on television.

873
00:40:51,433 --> 00:40:53,799
You know, I was just talking
to Davenport over at Gulden's,

874
00:40:53,869 --> 00:40:56,565
and when I told him that this guy
was your guy, well...

875
00:40:56,638 --> 00:40:58,765
We'd like to take
you two kids out to dinner,

876
00:40:58,841 --> 00:41:00,069
just the 6 of us.

877
00:41:01,310 --> 00:41:03,938
You got a cough,
Darcy? The 8 of us.

878
00:41:04,012 --> 00:41:06,378
Uh, Mr. Mercer,
the thing is,

879
00:41:06,448 --> 00:41:08,211
he lives in Massachusetts.

880
00:41:08,283 --> 00:41:09,409
Well, I'm not
talking about tonight.

881
00:41:09,485 --> 00:41:11,612
You know, this weekend
or early next week.

882
00:41:11,687 --> 00:41:14,622
It would really
mean the world to Davenport.

883
00:41:16,158 --> 00:41:17,591
Ah...

884
00:41:17,659 --> 00:41:20,321
Thank you for calling
Times Of Your Life Video.

885
00:41:20,395 --> 00:41:22,795
This is Nick. I'm not here
to take your call right now,

886
00:41:22,865 --> 00:41:25,026
but if you tell this machine who
you are and how to reach you,

887
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:26,897
I promise to call you back.

888
00:41:27,970 --> 00:41:29,597
Hi.
This is Kate Mosley.

889
00:41:29,671 --> 00:41:31,832
We met at Susan
and Sajit's wedding.

890
00:41:31,907 --> 00:41:34,842
I'm the girl who caught-
No. Wait.

891
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:36,275
I was actually handed
the bouquet, remember?

892
00:41:36,345 --> 00:41:37,903
Anyway, I got
your number from Susan,

893
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:41,347
and I was wondering if I could
buy you a cup of coffee.

894
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:43,316
You name the place.
I'll come to you.

895
00:41:43,385 --> 00:41:45,478
I'd appreciate it if you'd
call me back either way.

896
00:41:45,554 --> 00:41:46,680
Bye.

897
00:41:52,027 --> 00:41:53,961
Hey, how are you?

898
00:41:54,029 --> 00:41:55,018
Good job.

899
00:41:55,097 --> 00:41:56,530
That was
really wonderful.

900
00:41:56,598 --> 00:41:57,530
Great job.

901
00:41:57,599 --> 00:41:58,531
Thank you very much.

902
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,532
Hi.

903
00:41:59,601 --> 00:42:00,659
Hi.

904
00:42:00,736 --> 00:42:02,829
Wow! They really love you
around here, huh?

905
00:42:02,905 --> 00:42:06,068
Oh, yeah.
My public thing.

906
00:42:06,141 --> 00:42:08,371
Uh-huh.

907
00:42:08,443 --> 00:42:09,467
Thank you.

908
00:42:09,545 --> 00:42:10,477
Thanks, Lois.

909
00:42:10,546 --> 00:42:11,774
Um...

910
00:42:15,350 --> 00:42:18,148
I've done a really-
I've done a really horrible thing.

911
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:21,314
Wha-you know,
I find that hard to believe.

912
00:42:21,390 --> 00:42:23,881
Well, um...

913
00:42:23,959 --> 00:42:26,894
See, a friend of mine
found a picture

914
00:42:26,962 --> 00:42:30,864
of the two of us
from the wedding, you know,

915
00:42:30,933 --> 00:42:34,369
and basically led a lot
of people to believe

916
00:42:34,436 --> 00:42:36,870
that you and I
were basically...

917
00:42:36,939 --> 00:42:38,099
What?

918
00:42:39,675 --> 00:42:43,111
Uh, engaged,
actually.

919
00:42:43,178 --> 00:42:47,114
Yeah. And, uh, I didn't
really do or say much

920
00:42:47,182 --> 00:42:49,116
to let them
think otherwise.

921
00:42:49,184 --> 00:42:51,744
What do you
think so far?

922
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:55,114
Uh... so far?

923
00:42:55,190 --> 00:42:58,318
Uh, I-I'm flattered,
I think.

924
00:43:00,128 --> 00:43:04,929
Okay, well, see, it was going well,
for a while, you know,

925
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:09,903
and, uh, then you went
and you got famous on me.

926
00:43:09,972 --> 00:43:12,873
I'd, uh...
Oh, God. Oh, God.

927
00:43:12,941 --> 00:43:14,374
Wow. This is-

928
00:43:14,443 --> 00:43:17,378
This is just so embarrassing
and humiliating.

929
00:43:17,446 --> 00:43:19,744
What, uh, what did
you come here to ask me?

930
00:43:19,815 --> 00:43:21,180
All right.

931
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:24,981
All right,
it's a proposition, actually.

932
00:43:25,053 --> 00:43:27,954
I will pay you $ 1,000
if you will come to New York City

933
00:43:28,023 --> 00:43:30,355
and have dinner with me
and some people that I work with.

934
00:43:30,425 --> 00:43:31,790
I'll buy you
a plane ticket,

935
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:33,122
I'll buy you a suit
if you need one.

936
00:43:33,195 --> 00:43:34,423
I don't want you
to feel like a thing.

937
00:43:34,496 --> 00:43:36,088
I mean, think of it as,
like, a paid vacation.

938
00:43:36,164 --> 00:43:37,597
You can stay with me.

939
00:43:37,666 --> 00:43:41,500
You know, you can't
work with that cast, right? And...

940
00:43:41,570 --> 00:43:43,663
Okay, so this
is the plan.

941
00:43:43,739 --> 00:43:46,503
Two-thirds of the way through the
dinner, you would pick a fight with me.

942
00:43:46,575 --> 00:43:49,635
And we would have,
like, a quarrel, right?

943
00:43:49,711 --> 00:43:50,939
And everybody would
watch us break up.

944
00:43:51,013 --> 00:43:52,981
You would never
have to see me again.

945
00:43:53,048 --> 00:43:54,948
And, you know,
there it is.

946
00:43:55,017 --> 00:43:56,780
Wow. That really
sounds like something

947
00:43:56,852 --> 00:43:59,548
right out of The Patty Duke Show,
doesn't it? Ha ha.

948
00:43:59,621 --> 00:44:00,952
Oh.

949
00:44:01,023 --> 00:44:03,321
You want to pay me
to have dinner with you?

950
00:44:07,996 --> 00:44:09,156
Yeah.

951
00:44:12,634 --> 00:44:14,568
Uh...

952
00:44:14,636 --> 00:44:16,160
I, uh...

953
00:44:16,238 --> 00:44:19,332
I don't, you know,
I don't want your money.

954
00:44:19,408 --> 00:44:20,807
Yeah.

955
00:44:20,876 --> 00:44:22,070
Okay.

956
00:44:22,144 --> 00:44:25,204
That's...
That's a no, right?

957
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:26,770
See, the thing is,

958
00:44:26,848 --> 00:44:32,787
I was, uh, thinking
of coming to New York, you know...

959
00:44:32,854 --> 00:44:36,290
and, uh, you know, I was gonna
get your number from Susan

960
00:44:36,358 --> 00:44:42,092
and, uh, ask you if you wanted
to have dinner with me.

961
00:44:42,164 --> 00:44:47,124
So, yes. You, uh... Figure out
what night is best for you

962
00:44:47,202 --> 00:44:49,102
because I'm pretty
flexible, you know?

963
00:44:49,171 --> 00:44:51,901
So if you want to bring a friend
or people you work with,

964
00:44:51,974 --> 00:44:53,271
that's up to you,

965
00:44:53,342 --> 00:44:57,278
and it's good we ran into
each other again like this.

966
00:44:57,346 --> 00:44:59,906
So think about what I said, and I'll
give you a call tomorrow. Okay?

967
00:45:03,118 --> 00:45:05,086
Oh, uh, by the way...

968
00:45:05,153 --> 00:45:06,848
I do own a suit.

969
00:45:06,922 --> 00:45:09,356
Of course you do.

970
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:13,625
And when I get that feeling

971
00:45:13,695 --> 00:45:14,957
See you.

972
00:45:15,030 --> 00:45:17,055
Tony, I'll see
you tonight.

973
00:45:17,132 --> 00:45:19,327
I can no longer run

974
00:45:19,401 --> 00:45:20,993
I don't know

975
00:45:21,069 --> 00:45:24,903
And when I get that feeling

976
00:45:27,743 --> 00:45:29,711
Ma, your color
looks so beautiful.

977
00:45:29,778 --> 00:45:31,211
Never mind that.

978
00:45:31,279 --> 00:45:33,747
What I don't
understand is...

979
00:45:33,815 --> 00:45:35,510
He can come all
the way to New York

980
00:45:35,584 --> 00:45:37,381
just to meet the people
you work with,

981
00:45:37,452 --> 00:45:39,886
but he can't
find an hour

982
00:45:39,955 --> 00:45:42,981
to visit with his
future mother-in-law.

983
00:45:43,058 --> 00:45:45,549
Mom, he's busy, okay?
He's really busy.

984
00:45:45,627 --> 00:45:48,824
It's just gonna have to be
another trip, you know, another time.

985
00:45:48,897 --> 00:45:51,866
Are you lying to me?

986
00:45:51,933 --> 00:45:54,231
I embarrass you.

987
00:45:54,302 --> 00:45:55,234
Oh, Mom...

988
00:45:55,303 --> 00:45:56,600
Is that it?

989
00:45:56,671 --> 00:45:57,603
Mom, no, no.

990
00:45:57,672 --> 00:45:59,469
In fact,
you know what?

991
00:45:59,541 --> 00:46:01,907
I'm afraid he's
gonna come here,

992
00:46:01,977 --> 00:46:04,878
take one look at you,
and say to himself,

993
00:46:04,946 --> 00:46:09,042
"What the hell am I doing
marrying the junior version

994
00:46:09,117 --> 00:46:12,780
when the real thing
is still available? '

995
00:46:12,854 --> 00:46:15,288
I don't believe
a word of that,

996
00:46:15,357 --> 00:46:17,226
but I appreciate
the effort.

997
00:46:27,769 --> 00:46:29,202
But he won't.

998
00:46:29,271 --> 00:46:32,138
The key here that
you're missing is

999
00:46:32,207 --> 00:46:34,937
that the only mustard
he uses is Gulden's.

1000
00:46:35,010 --> 00:46:37,501
Yeah, that's it.
That's it.

1001
00:46:37,579 --> 00:46:40,070
Hi. Uh, yeah, okay,
so will you call-

1002
00:46:40,148 --> 00:46:43,584
I gotto go, but will you
call me when you find him?

1003
00:46:43,652 --> 00:46:44,710
Thank you very much.

1004
00:46:44,786 --> 00:46:46,879
Ha! Hey!

1005
00:46:46,955 --> 00:46:47,887
Hi!

1006
00:46:47,956 --> 00:46:49,583
Hi! You're here.

1007
00:46:49,658 --> 00:46:51,922
I'm supposed to meet you
at my apartment two hours from now.

1008
00:46:51,994 --> 00:46:53,723
Yeah. I got
an earlier bus.

1009
00:46:53,795 --> 00:46:55,228
Oh, did you?
Oh... oh.

1010
00:46:55,297 --> 00:46:57,788
Yeah. It's good
to see you-

1011
00:47:05,974 --> 00:47:08,306
I'm sorry, I didn't know we
were on the clock yet.

1012
00:47:08,377 --> 00:47:11,369
Okay, just grab my ass, kiss my neck,
and pull me into the office, okay?

1013
00:47:11,446 --> 00:47:12,879
Y- uh, y-yeah.

1014
00:47:12,948 --> 00:47:13,573
Yes, sir.

1015
00:47:13,649 --> 00:47:16,482
Whoo!
Ha ha ha!

1016
00:47:18,287 --> 00:47:21,017
Je-sus!

1017
00:47:21,089 --> 00:47:23,284
What is the world
coming to?

1018
00:47:23,358 --> 00:47:26,816
Okay, so what I told people
is that we met in college,

1019
00:47:26,895 --> 00:47:28,556
but we were
just friends

1020
00:47:28,630 --> 00:47:30,825
and that we re-met at this
reunion thing, like, 5 years later.

1021
00:47:30,899 --> 00:47:32,332
It was sort of like,

1022
00:47:32,401 --> 00:47:33,868
I don't know, that's when the fire
really got ignited, you know?

1023
00:47:33,935 --> 00:47:36,096
I kind of like that.
We meet. We meet again.

1024
00:47:36,171 --> 00:47:39,197
That makes it more,
I don't know... believable.

1025
00:47:39,274 --> 00:47:40,332
I wouldn't know.

1026
00:47:40,409 --> 00:47:41,603
You went to college,
right?

1027
00:47:41,677 --> 00:47:43,474
Yeah. Several.

1028
00:47:43,545 --> 00:47:44,944
Hmm.

1029
00:47:45,013 --> 00:47:47,846
Well, if anybody asks, just say
you went to Boston University,

1030
00:47:47,916 --> 00:47:50,248
because that's where
I went, and everybody knows that.

1031
00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:51,946
Maybe we should
say business.

1032
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:53,214
I majored
in business.

1033
00:47:53,288 --> 00:47:55,017
I mean, I told everybody you own
your own business,

1034
00:47:55,090 --> 00:47:56,114
you know,
the video thing,

1035
00:47:56,191 --> 00:47:57,453
but I kind of fudged
about the wedding part.

1036
00:47:57,526 --> 00:47:59,892
Maybe we should just let them
think it's music videos.

1037
00:47:59,961 --> 00:48:01,656
It's more glamorous
and all that sort of stuff, anyway.

1038
00:48:01,730 --> 00:48:02,754
Oh, you don't mind
that, do you?

1039
00:48:02,831 --> 00:48:04,822
Actually, you know,
I do mind, 'cause-

1040
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:06,868
Oh! And I had
really long hair.

1041
00:48:06,935 --> 00:48:08,800
In college I had
really long hair.

1042
00:48:08,870 --> 00:48:11,202
And I was about 20
or so pounds heavier.

1043
00:48:11,273 --> 00:48:13,298
But that's good.
That'll be good. You know why?

1044
00:48:13,375 --> 00:48:15,275
Because you can say
it was the weight thing

1045
00:48:15,344 --> 00:48:16,641
that kind of turned
your head around.

1046
00:48:16,712 --> 00:48:18,043
That'll be good.

1047
00:48:18,113 --> 00:48:19,671
Okay, now, this is
the bathroom,

1048
00:48:19,748 --> 00:48:21,909
and I'll get you
some towels and stuff,

1049
00:48:21,983 --> 00:48:23,143
and I'll let you know
which is yours.

1050
00:48:23,218 --> 00:48:24,549
And then this
is the couch.

1051
00:48:24,619 --> 00:48:25,916
This is where
you'll be sleeping.

1052
00:48:25,987 --> 00:48:27,181
And I'll get you
some comfy pillows

1053
00:48:27,255 --> 00:48:29,223
and some blankets
and sort of, you know-

1054
00:48:29,291 --> 00:48:30,223
it should be nice-

1055
00:48:31,293 --> 00:48:33,056
Oop, sorry.
Just a minute.

1056
00:48:34,262 --> 00:48:35,559
Hello?

1057
00:48:38,266 --> 00:48:40,860
Can you, uh,
hold on a second?

1058
00:48:40,936 --> 00:48:43,564
Uh, Nick,
I'll be right back.

1059
00:48:58,286 --> 00:49:01,687
Ha! I cannot believe
you are saying that.

1060
00:49:04,793 --> 00:49:07,728
Okay, all right.
Look, I'll do it. Okay?

1061
00:49:07,796 --> 00:49:09,764
But I cannot stay long.

1062
00:49:09,831 --> 00:49:11,025
All right?

1063
00:49:12,434 --> 00:49:14,026
Okay. Bye.

1064
00:49:15,570 --> 00:49:17,231
Is everything okay?

1065
00:49:17,305 --> 00:49:21,139
Um, yeah, I, uh-
Something just came up at work.

1066
00:49:21,209 --> 00:49:25,009
I've gotto meet a colleague
for a drink, but I shouldn't be long.

1067
00:49:34,856 --> 00:49:36,847
Hey!
Is this your mother?

1068
00:49:36,925 --> 00:49:38,825
Uh, I don't know
what you're looking at.

1069
00:49:38,894 --> 00:49:40,555
How about this picture
of a beautiful woman

1070
00:49:40,629 --> 00:49:42,221
that looks just like you
but older.

1071
00:49:42,297 --> 00:49:43,730
Is that your mother?

1072
00:49:43,799 --> 00:49:45,232
Ha ha ha!

1073
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:45,959
Yes.

1074
00:49:46,034 --> 00:49:47,626
That would be Mom.

1075
00:49:47,702 --> 00:49:49,067
She's pretty.

1076
00:49:54,643 --> 00:49:56,110
Whoo! Wow.

1077
00:49:56,178 --> 00:49:57,907
Thanks.

1078
00:49:57,979 --> 00:49:59,776
Okay, well, I shouldn't
be long, Nick.

1079
00:49:59,848 --> 00:50:00,872
An hour, tops.

1080
00:50:00,949 --> 00:50:02,314
Uh, I mean
I wouldn't even go,

1081
00:50:02,384 --> 00:50:04,909
I mean, I know it's your first night
in a strange city.

1082
00:50:04,986 --> 00:50:06,749
He just sounded
so panicked.

1083
00:50:06,822 --> 00:50:08,380
He?

1084
00:50:08,457 --> 00:50:10,049
Oh! I have
something for you.

1085
00:50:10,125 --> 00:50:11,558
Oh.

1086
00:50:16,631 --> 00:50:18,656
If you could look at this
while I'm gone,

1087
00:50:18,733 --> 00:50:20,257
that would be great.

1088
00:50:20,335 --> 00:50:22,064
Yeah. What is it?

1089
00:50:22,137 --> 00:50:25,971
Well, it's sort of
a study guide, actually.

1090
00:50:26,041 --> 00:50:28,874
It's, you know,
our life together.

1091
00:50:28,944 --> 00:50:31,071
My hobbies,
my ex-boyfriends,

1092
00:50:31,146 --> 00:50:34,775
uh, what happened to me
during the 5 years we were apart,

1093
00:50:34,850 --> 00:50:36,875
our reunion, things I've said
to people about you...

1094
00:50:36,952 --> 00:50:38,351
Wow! You've really
put a lot of work into this.

1095
00:50:38,420 --> 00:50:39,682
Yeah.

1096
00:50:39,754 --> 00:50:40,846
Well, it's my life.

1097
00:50:40,922 --> 00:50:42,219
Sort of.

1098
00:50:42,290 --> 00:50:45,259
Okay, and then
there's this.

1099
00:50:45,327 --> 00:50:47,352
Oh, hey, the, uh...

1100
00:50:47,429 --> 00:50:49,624
Yeah, this is the fight that we're
gonna have tomorrow night.

1101
00:50:49,698 --> 00:50:52,633
Um, so I sort of-
I wrote it out like a play, so...

1102
00:50:52,701 --> 00:50:54,635
Okay. "Look, I'm sorry, Kate,
but I can no longer accept that-"

1103
00:50:54,703 --> 00:50:55,635
This is me, right?

1104
00:50:55,704 --> 00:50:56,636
Yeah.

1105
00:50:56,705 --> 00:50:58,138
"I'm sorry, Kate,
but I can no longer

1106
00:50:58,206 --> 00:51:00,037
"accept the time and energy
you put into your work.

1107
00:51:00,108 --> 00:51:01,473
"There has to be
something left for me.

1108
00:51:01,543 --> 00:51:03,340
Every minute of every day
can't be about Mercer Advertising."

1109
00:51:03,411 --> 00:51:04,708
Yeah. Right.

1110
00:51:04,779 --> 00:51:07,407
So, you know, it doesn't have to be
verbatim, basically.

1111
00:51:07,482 --> 00:51:09,279
I mean, you can put it
into your own words.

1112
00:51:09,351 --> 00:51:11,512
Oh, oh, yeah.
I think I will.

1113
00:51:11,586 --> 00:51:13,850
Great. No, but as long as you
get the basic point across,

1114
00:51:13,922 --> 00:51:15,412
you know,
like you've had it.

1115
00:51:15,490 --> 00:51:18,789
I'm always at work,
my mind is always on my work.

1116
00:51:18,860 --> 00:51:20,418
So I thought that
would be sort of a nice touch,

1117
00:51:20,495 --> 00:51:22,895
if our breakup sort of reaffirmed
my commitment to the firm.

1118
00:51:22,964 --> 00:51:24,829
Well, yeah.
That sounds smart.

1119
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:28,097
Okay, great, so I'll be at this place
called Man Ray.

1120
00:51:28,169 --> 00:51:31,002
It's in the phone book
if you need me,

1121
00:51:31,072 --> 00:51:33,438
but I really- I should just
be an hour.

1122
00:51:34,843 --> 00:51:36,902
Oh... thanks, Nick,

1123
00:51:36,978 --> 00:51:41,108
for coming down here
and doing this.

1124
00:52:01,102 --> 00:52:02,399
I'm really
embarrassed.

1125
00:52:02,470 --> 00:52:04,802
I mean, I've been babbling
for what, like, two hours now?

1126
00:52:04,873 --> 00:52:06,465
Oh, come on, Sam.
Don't be embarrassed.

1127
00:52:06,541 --> 00:52:07,633
I don't usually
react this way.

1128
00:52:07,709 --> 00:52:09,074
You were
kissing your fianc.

1129
00:52:09,144 --> 00:52:11,578
It's a perfectly normal thing
for you to be doing.

1130
00:52:11,646 --> 00:52:13,841
I don't know why
it had such an effect on me.

1131
00:52:13,915 --> 00:52:15,542
It's okay, Sam,
it's really okay.

1132
00:52:15,617 --> 00:52:17,983
But you know what?
I did tell him an hour-

1133
00:52:18,053 --> 00:52:18,917
How did he do it?

1134
00:52:18,987 --> 00:52:20,079
What? Do what?

1135
00:52:20,155 --> 00:52:22,089
Propose. I mean,
did he get down on one knee?

1136
00:52:22,157 --> 00:52:23,419
What did he say?

1137
00:52:23,491 --> 00:52:24,924
Oh...

1138
00:52:24,993 --> 00:52:26,585
Oh, God.
I'm sorry.

1139
00:52:26,661 --> 00:52:28,060
Why? For what?

1140
00:52:28,129 --> 00:52:30,427
Well,
for the other night.

1141
00:52:30,498 --> 00:52:33,934
And the other...
other night.

1142
00:52:35,337 --> 00:52:36,599
Kate.

1143
00:52:36,671 --> 00:52:37,603
Yeah?

1144
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:42,305
If I had
known you first...

1145
00:52:42,377 --> 00:52:44,902
would it have
made a difference?

1146
00:52:48,016 --> 00:52:49,449
Sam...

1147
00:52:49,517 --> 00:52:52,315
Okay. I gotto
tell you something.

1148
00:52:52,387 --> 00:52:53,354
Okay?

1149
00:52:53,421 --> 00:52:57,118
It has to do with me
and, uh, Nick-

1150
00:52:57,192 --> 00:52:58,625
Somebody
mention my name?

1151
00:52:58,693 --> 00:53:00,092
Oh, my God! Hi!

1152
00:53:00,161 --> 00:53:01,025
Hi!

1153
00:53:01,096 --> 00:53:02,461
Nick-oop.

1154
00:53:02,530 --> 00:53:03,462
Unh-

1155
00:53:03,531 --> 00:53:04,463
Mmm.

1156
00:53:06,201 --> 00:53:09,136
That's, uh,
that's a kiss from college.

1157
00:53:09,204 --> 00:53:10,136
Boston University
thing. Ha!

1158
00:53:10,205 --> 00:53:13,265
Uh, Nick,
this is Sam Mayfair.

1159
00:53:13,341 --> 00:53:14,672
We work together
at Mercer.

1160
00:53:14,743 --> 00:53:15,835
And, uh...

1161
00:53:15,910 --> 00:53:18,310
This is, uh,
this is my Nick.

1162
00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:19,312
Wow.

1163
00:53:19,381 --> 00:53:20,678
Your Nick.

1164
00:53:20,749 --> 00:53:22,614
And you're Nick.

1165
00:53:22,684 --> 00:53:24,083
That's your Nick.

1166
00:53:24,152 --> 00:53:26,086
I may have had
a little too much to drink.

1167
00:53:26,154 --> 00:53:27,416
I'm her Sam.

1168
00:53:29,424 --> 00:53:32,086
It certainly is an honor
to have met you, Nick.

1169
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:34,594
I mean, you know,
you've been the topic

1170
00:53:34,663 --> 00:53:37,598
of a lot of conversation
and speculation around here.

1171
00:53:37,666 --> 00:53:40,601
I'm very sorry that I monopolized
your fiance's evening,

1172
00:53:40,669 --> 00:53:43,604
but I've just come to realize
that she's...

1173
00:53:43,672 --> 00:53:45,606
Damn it. She's just
the kind of girl

1174
00:53:45,674 --> 00:53:47,505
you'd like to
monopolize, you know?

1175
00:53:47,575 --> 00:53:48,872
Oh!

1176
00:53:48,943 --> 00:53:50,308
Is everything
okay in there?

1177
00:53:50,378 --> 00:53:53,108
Ha ha ha!

1178
00:53:53,181 --> 00:53:56,173
What? Is that guy-
Is he your boyfriend?

1179
00:53:56,251 --> 00:53:57,445
Oh, him? No.

1180
00:53:57,519 --> 00:53:58,577
No. He's
just a friend.

1181
00:53:58,653 --> 00:53:59,585
Oh.

1182
00:53:59,654 --> 00:54:00,848
Sleeps over
sometimes,

1183
00:54:00,922 --> 00:54:02,753
but he's
just a friend.

1184
00:54:02,824 --> 00:54:04,525
Aha.

1185
00:54:05,092 --> 00:54:07,925
Roger.

1186
00:54:07,995 --> 00:54:09,428
Mike.

1187
00:54:11,999 --> 00:54:14,433
Ivan.

1188
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:17,265
Sure is a lot of
boyfriends in here.

1189
00:54:17,337 --> 00:54:19,532
Yeah. So?

1190
00:54:19,606 --> 00:54:21,540
Going somewhere
with that?

1191
00:54:21,608 --> 00:54:24,372
No. No, no, no.

1192
00:54:24,444 --> 00:54:27,038
Not me.

1193
00:54:27,114 --> 00:54:31,380
Just, uh, your life's
a real page-turner. That's all.

1194
00:54:31,451 --> 00:54:34,215
Mmm.

1195
00:54:34,288 --> 00:54:37,052
Oh! There's something
I forgot to ask you.

1196
00:54:37,124 --> 00:54:39,251
How come there's nothing in the book
about your father?

1197
00:54:43,630 --> 00:54:47,566
Well... nothing
really to talk about.

1198
00:54:49,136 --> 00:54:53,573
I mean, he and my mother
split when I was 7,

1199
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:58,077
and I didn't see him again
for 10 years and then, uh...

1200
00:54:58,145 --> 00:54:59,840
and then he passed away.

1201
00:54:59,913 --> 00:55:01,574
I'm sorry.

1202
00:55:01,648 --> 00:55:04,082
Don't be.
I mean...

1203
00:55:04,151 --> 00:55:07,052
I really barely
remember the guy.

1204
00:55:10,090 --> 00:55:14,527
He had a pair
of plaid pajamas.

1205
00:55:16,597 --> 00:55:18,531
Ohh...

1206
00:55:18,599 --> 00:55:24,538
Oh, and I remember, um,
one night after work...

1207
00:55:26,106 --> 00:55:29,542
He took me to
the department store,

1208
00:55:29,610 --> 00:55:32,545
just-just him and me,

1209
00:55:32,613 --> 00:55:36,549
and, um, he bought me
my first watch.

1210
00:55:36,617 --> 00:55:41,054
It was one of those Cinderella watches,
you know, um...

1211
00:55:41,121 --> 00:55:42,611
Do you know what
I'm talking about?

1212
00:55:42,689 --> 00:55:43,656
Mm-hmm.

1213
00:55:43,724 --> 00:55:50,061
And, um, I remember
thinking to myself,

1214
00:55:50,130 --> 00:55:53,122
this is really special.

1215
00:55:54,635 --> 00:55:57,570
If I'd known
he was going to leave,

1216
00:55:57,638 --> 00:56:00,072
I would have taken a little better
care of the thing, you know...

1217
00:56:00,140 --> 00:56:02,631
hung on to it.

1218
00:56:07,581 --> 00:56:13,076
Huh. It's weird,
the things you remember.

1219
00:56:13,153 --> 00:56:14,586
Okay, my birthday?

1220
00:56:14,655 --> 00:56:16,020
April 3, 1968.

1221
00:56:16,089 --> 00:56:18,023
Okay, you can leave
out the year.

1222
00:56:18,091 --> 00:56:19,023
First job?

1223
00:56:19,092 --> 00:56:21,026
You were
a junior copywriter,

1224
00:56:21,094 --> 00:56:24,530
but you were promoted
to full copywriter in 5 short months.

1225
00:56:24,598 --> 00:56:26,031
Career ambition?

1226
00:56:26,099 --> 00:56:28,033
Total world domination.
Do you want to get some breakfast?

1227
00:56:28,101 --> 00:56:29,534
No. There's no time.

1228
00:56:29,603 --> 00:56:31,036
Can I ask
you something?

1229
00:56:31,104 --> 00:56:32,537
Yeah.

1230
00:56:32,606 --> 00:56:34,540
Don't you, uh, don't you
need to learn about me?

1231
00:56:34,608 --> 00:56:36,041
What do you mean?

1232
00:56:36,109 --> 00:56:38,543
Well, you know, I'm really
boning up here about you.

1233
00:56:38,612 --> 00:56:40,546
I mean, don't you think you should
learn a little about me?

1234
00:56:40,614 --> 00:56:42,548
Yeah, but, Nick, you're forgetting.
This isn't about you.

1235
00:56:42,616 --> 00:56:44,550
I mean,
not the real you.

1236
00:56:44,618 --> 00:56:46,552
This is about
the you that I made up.

1237
00:56:46,620 --> 00:56:49,555
Oh, you know what
I need to learn?

1238
00:56:49,623 --> 00:56:50,555
What?

1239
00:56:50,624 --> 00:56:52,057
How do you take
your coffee?

1240
00:56:52,125 --> 00:56:53,592
Light, Sweet 'N Low.
Why?

1241
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:56,060
Well, you know, that's just stuff
I should know cold at dinnertime.

1242
00:56:56,129 --> 00:56:58,063
When people are involved,
they know that stuff.

1243
00:56:58,131 --> 00:57:00,065
Oh, right.
No, you're right.

1244
00:57:00,133 --> 00:57:01,566
You got
a favorite drink?

1245
00:57:01,635 --> 00:57:03,569
I mean, 'cause I don't want to
have to ask in front of everybody.

1246
00:57:03,637 --> 00:57:05,002
Dirty Martini.

1247
00:57:05,072 --> 00:57:07,006
Okay.

1248
00:57:07,074 --> 00:57:08,473
Well, what about you?

1249
00:57:08,542 --> 00:57:10,009
What about me?

1250
00:57:10,077 --> 00:57:12,511
I mean, I think I should at least
know how you take your coffee.

1251
00:57:12,579 --> 00:57:14,513
Well, I'm confused.
You don't know?

1252
00:57:14,581 --> 00:57:16,515
I mean, didn't
you make me up?

1253
00:57:16,583 --> 00:57:17,515
All right.

1254
00:57:17,584 --> 00:57:19,017
Black, one sugar.

1255
00:57:19,086 --> 00:57:20,018
Thank you.

1256
00:57:20,087 --> 00:57:21,019
You're welcome.

1257
00:57:21,088 --> 00:57:22,521
Okay, first dates
for 20.

1258
00:57:22,589 --> 00:57:26,025
Monet exhibit, Museum of Modern Art,
September 1995.

1259
00:57:26,093 --> 00:57:27,526
Pets for 40.

1260
00:57:27,594 --> 00:57:29,528
She had this cat
named Jerry till she was 15.

1261
00:57:29,596 --> 00:57:32,030
I didn't know her then, but I keep
threatening to get her a new cat.

1262
00:57:32,099 --> 00:57:34,033
Mm-hmm. Final Jeopardy.
Personal imperfections.

1263
00:57:34,101 --> 00:57:35,534
She has the cutest
little appendix scar,

1264
00:57:35,602 --> 00:57:38,036
and of course there's
her birthmark that-

1265
00:57:38,105 --> 00:57:40,039
Oh, honey, I wasn't supposed to
mention that. I'm sorry.

1266
00:57:40,107 --> 00:57:41,540
All right.

1267
00:57:41,608 --> 00:57:44,543
Then there's her glass eye
and her artificial hip

1268
00:57:44,611 --> 00:57:46,340
and her wooden leg.

1269
00:57:46,413 --> 00:57:47,345
Good evening.

1270
00:57:47,414 --> 00:57:48,540
Hi.

1271
00:57:48,615 --> 00:57:49,843
Want a seat?

1272
00:57:49,916 --> 00:57:51,349
Sure. Go ahead.

1273
00:57:55,122 --> 00:57:57,056
Mr. Mercer:
I mean, as I sit here,

1274
00:57:57,124 --> 00:57:59,558
the thing I see when I
look at the two of you,

1275
00:57:59,626 --> 00:58:04,325
the thing that moves me
is your unconditional love.

1276
00:58:04,397 --> 00:58:05,489
Hear, hear.

1277
00:58:05,565 --> 00:58:06,759
Thank you.

1278
00:58:06,833 --> 00:58:09,996
That means so much to us,
especially coming from you.

1279
00:58:10,070 --> 00:58:13,005
I mean, you're married,
and you really know.

1280
00:58:13,073 --> 00:58:14,506
Yeah.

1281
00:58:14,574 --> 00:58:17,008
Except for you, Darcy.
You've only been married 5 years.

1282
00:58:17,077 --> 00:58:19,011
Well, that's
only dog-ears.

1283
00:58:19,079 --> 00:58:22,014
But the Mercers and the Davenports
that really, um...

1284
00:58:22,082 --> 00:58:25,017
Well, actually, Elizabeth and I
have been married,

1285
00:58:25,085 --> 00:58:27,019
what, honey, 4 years?

1286
00:58:27,087 --> 00:58:30,022
4 years. Second marriage
for both of us.

1287
00:58:30,090 --> 00:58:32,024
I'm cuter than his ex-wife, though.
Ha ha!

1288
00:58:32,092 --> 00:58:34,026
Second one
for me, too,

1289
00:58:34,094 --> 00:58:37,530
but you only get married
for the second time once.

1290
00:58:37,597 --> 00:58:39,531
Mrs. Mercer:
Jackie...

1291
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:40,531
Ohh...

1292
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:42,033
My third.

1293
00:58:42,102 --> 00:58:46,038
Wow. Then you guys really know
what you're talking about.

1294
00:58:46,106 --> 00:58:47,038
Yeah.

1295
00:58:47,107 --> 00:58:49,041
Mrs. Mercer: We do.

1296
00:58:49,109 --> 00:58:52,306
Ha ha ha.

1297
00:58:55,115 --> 00:58:59,108
So, Nick, tell me
about videos.

1298
00:58:59,186 --> 00:59:01,381
Well, uh, what
would you like to know?

1299
00:59:01,454 --> 00:59:03,547
Well, um, how did you
get into that line of work?

1300
00:59:03,623 --> 00:59:04,988
I mean, I watch
them all the time.

1301
00:59:05,058 --> 00:59:07,492
A lot of smoke, a lot
of half-naked girls.

1302
00:59:07,561 --> 00:59:09,085
Well, it seems like a decent way
to make a living.

1303
00:59:09,162 --> 00:59:12,256
Huh. Really?

1304
00:59:15,569 --> 00:59:19,232
Those aren't really
the kind of videos I do.

1305
00:59:19,306 --> 00:59:23,003
Oh, I don't understand.
They all seem pretty much the same.

1306
00:59:23,076 --> 00:59:24,771
What-What kind
do you do?

1307
00:59:24,845 --> 00:59:29,475
I videotape weddings.

1308
00:59:29,549 --> 00:59:35,010
Oh. Well, that-
That is different.

1309
00:59:35,088 --> 00:59:37,386
Um, well, how did
you get into that?

1310
00:59:42,596 --> 00:59:45,531
Uh, I was looking
for a job

1311
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:47,123
that would require me to work
as few days a week as possible,

1312
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:51,034
and your midweek wedding
is a pretty unusual occurrence.

1313
00:59:51,104 --> 00:59:54,369
You can actually make
a living that way?

1314
00:59:54,441 --> 00:59:57,035
Videotaping a wedding
or two on the weekends?

1315
00:59:57,110 --> 00:59:58,600
I mean, that
satisfies you?

1316
00:59:58,678 --> 01:00:00,612
No.

1317
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:04,081
But once I started
videotaping people's weddings,

1318
01:00:04,150 --> 01:00:07,483
they would, you know,
come up to me for other things.

1319
01:00:07,554 --> 01:00:10,580
You know, "My wife's having a baby
shower. Could you videotape that? '

1320
01:00:10,657 --> 01:00:13,990
Or "Hey, my daughter's getting baptized.
Could you come on by? '

1321
01:00:14,060 --> 01:00:16,620
Or "My kid's got the lead in the school
play. You gotto be there."

1322
01:00:16,696 --> 01:00:22,999
I was working 6, 7 days
a week, and I loved it.

1323
01:00:23,069 --> 01:00:25,060
I can't explain it
really.

1324
01:00:25,138 --> 01:00:29,006
Something about watching a baby being
welcomed to the world by its new family

1325
01:00:29,075 --> 01:00:33,011
or a kid getting his first at bat
in a little league game.

1326
01:00:33,079 --> 01:00:34,410
I don't know.

1327
01:00:34,481 --> 01:00:37,006
I don't know.
It's, uh...

1328
01:00:37,083 --> 01:00:39,074
It's an honor.

1329
01:00:39,152 --> 01:00:42,986
It's an honor that these people asked me
to be there for those moments...

1330
01:00:43,056 --> 01:00:46,514
and I get paid for it.

1331
01:00:51,831 --> 01:00:55,164
I'd like to propose
one last toast...

1332
01:00:55,235 --> 01:00:57,169
to our new friend Nick...

1333
01:00:57,237 --> 01:01:01,037
definitely someone
I'd like to have in my lifeboat.

1334
01:01:01,107 --> 01:01:02,039
Hear, hear.

1335
01:01:02,108 --> 01:01:03,040
Cheers.

1336
01:01:03,109 --> 01:01:04,474
Thank you.

1337
01:01:07,047 --> 01:01:09,038
What do you say,
honey?

1338
01:01:09,115 --> 01:01:11,982
Don't be afraid
to dive right in.

1339
01:01:28,068 --> 01:01:29,501
Whoo.

1340
01:01:32,505 --> 01:01:33,995
Ahem.

1341
01:01:34,074 --> 01:01:35,507
I suddenly realized

1342
01:01:35,575 --> 01:01:37,509
that I haven't told you
how beautiful you look tonight.

1343
01:01:37,577 --> 01:01:40,512
Oh, Nick, come on.
Don't waste that stuff.

1344
01:01:40,580 --> 01:01:42,514
Nobody's here.
They can't hear you.

1345
01:01:50,590 --> 01:01:53,525
Oh, I'm sorry.

1346
01:01:53,593 --> 01:01:55,527
I'm sorry.

1347
01:01:55,595 --> 01:01:57,529
Thank you.

1348
01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:01,533
Thank you.

1349
01:02:06,039 --> 01:02:07,973
Do you want to dance?
Maybe we should dance.

1350
01:02:08,041 --> 01:02:09,474
Yeah, yeah.

1351
01:02:29,062 --> 01:02:31,997
So how do you
think it's going?

1352
01:02:32,065 --> 01:02:34,499
Um, fine, I guess.

1353
01:02:34,567 --> 01:02:38,003
But you know if one of us
doesn't start this fight pretty soon,

1354
01:02:38,071 --> 01:02:40,471
um, everybody's
going to miss it.

1355
01:02:40,540 --> 01:02:42,007
Right.

1356
01:02:43,576 --> 01:02:46,511
I was, uh...
I was thinking.

1357
01:02:49,082 --> 01:02:52,449
What if, um, what if I didn't
pick a fight with you tonight?

1358
01:02:52,519 --> 01:02:56,011
You know, what if we finished
our meal with these people and...

1359
01:02:56,089 --> 01:02:57,386
And what?

1360
01:02:57,457 --> 01:02:59,516
Um, I don't know.

1361
01:02:59,592 --> 01:03:02,026
You know, I...

1362
01:03:02,095 --> 01:03:03,960
You know,
I could come down on weekends.

1363
01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:06,464
I could get to
know you better.

1364
01:03:06,533 --> 01:03:07,465
Ahem.

1365
01:03:07,534 --> 01:03:09,468
You could always
break up with me...

1366
01:03:09,536 --> 01:03:11,470
down the road,
you know?

1367
01:03:11,538 --> 01:03:12,869
Mm-hmm.

1368
01:03:12,939 --> 01:03:15,373
Sorry if I'm making your life
more complicated, Kate, okay?

1369
01:03:15,442 --> 01:03:17,876
But I find you
so attractive.

1370
01:03:17,944 --> 01:03:19,969
Okay, stop! Don't!
Listen, don't say that.

1371
01:03:20,046 --> 01:03:22,981
Come on. See,
that is why I wanted to pay you.

1372
01:03:23,049 --> 01:03:25,483
Okay. No, you're right.
I'm sorry.

1373
01:03:25,552 --> 01:03:27,486
I can't believe I'm apologizing
for liking you.

1374
01:03:27,554 --> 01:03:30,182
Is it this other guy?
This guy that's not your boyfriend?

1375
01:03:30,256 --> 01:03:31,484
Shh! Leave him out
of this, all right?

1376
01:03:31,558 --> 01:03:33,253
We had a deal.
That's all.

1377
01:03:33,326 --> 01:03:34,554
Then why isn't he
your boyfriend, Kate?

1378
01:03:34,627 --> 01:03:35,525
If you like him so much
and he likes you,

1379
01:03:35,595 --> 01:03:36,892
then why isn't he
your boyfriend?

1380
01:03:36,963 --> 01:03:38,487
Because, technically,
I'm unavailable

1381
01:03:38,565 --> 01:03:41,500
because, technically,
you are my boyfriend, okay?

1382
01:03:41,568 --> 01:03:44,264
Oh. So let me get
this straight.

1383
01:03:44,337 --> 01:03:48,569
You're sleeping with a guy who,
technically, you can't go out with,

1384
01:03:48,641 --> 01:03:50,506
but you won't even
consider just dating me,

1385
01:03:50,577 --> 01:03:52,738
who, technically, you're going to
marry and have kids with.

1386
01:03:52,812 --> 01:03:56,509
Okay, look. Listen, I don't want to
date you. I don't want to marry you.

1387
01:03:56,583 --> 01:04:00,019
I don't want to have kids with you.
I just want to break up with you.

1388
01:04:00,086 --> 01:04:03,021
Please, that's
why we're here. Okay?

1389
01:04:03,089 --> 01:04:06,923
So please can we
just stick to the plan?

1390
01:04:06,993 --> 01:04:08,517
Please.

1391
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:15,931
See you
Wednesday, all right?

1392
01:04:16,002 --> 01:04:17,526
Mrs. Davenport: Good night.

1393
01:04:17,604 --> 01:04:20,539
Well, sorry, kids,
but we're out of here.

1394
01:04:20,607 --> 01:04:23,542
No, no, no,
you can't leave yet.

1395
01:04:23,610 --> 01:04:25,544
I know, I know, I sense
that something big is in the air,

1396
01:04:25,612 --> 01:04:28,547
but I've gotto
get up early.

1397
01:04:28,615 --> 01:04:29,547
We've got a meeting
with a marriage counselor.

1398
01:04:29,616 --> 01:04:33,052
Nick, um, pleasure
meeting you,

1399
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:36,555
and you are everything
Kate said you would be.

1400
01:04:36,623 --> 01:04:37,555
Good night.

1401
01:04:37,624 --> 01:04:39,558
Good night!

1402
01:04:39,626 --> 01:04:41,059
Mrs. Mercer: Good night.

1403
01:04:41,127 --> 01:04:43,061
Good night.

1404
01:04:43,129 --> 01:04:45,791
Mrs. Mercer: Oh, I love her.

1405
01:04:45,865 --> 01:04:48,561
Jackie, she turned me on
to a great pilates teacher.

1406
01:04:48,635 --> 01:04:50,262
Very ambitious.

1407
01:04:50,336 --> 01:04:52,304
Honestly.

1408
01:04:52,372 --> 01:04:55,569
This has been such
a wonderful evening.

1409
01:04:55,642 --> 01:04:57,803
Thank you. Thanks.

1410
01:04:57,877 --> 01:04:59,242
Yes, it has been.
It really has been.

1411
01:05:00,647 --> 01:05:04,777
Mr. Davenport: Well, um,
one for the road?

1412
01:05:09,322 --> 01:05:13,019
My! Honey!
Are you-excuse me.

1413
01:05:13,092 --> 01:05:15,083
This is so weird, I-

1414
01:05:15,161 --> 01:05:17,356
Come on!

1415
01:05:19,098 --> 01:05:21,589
Everything all right
under there?

1416
01:05:21,668 --> 01:05:23,533
Ooh! Yeah!

1417
01:05:23,603 --> 01:05:26,834
I just, uh, kicked
myself in the shin.

1418
01:05:26,906 --> 01:05:28,737
He's always-He's
always doing that.

1419
01:05:28,808 --> 01:05:31,003
He just has this
weird tic thing that...

1420
01:05:31,077 --> 01:05:32,169
Spasm.

1421
01:05:32,245 --> 01:05:34,042
Oh, honey, you know
what? By the way,

1422
01:05:34,113 --> 01:05:35,546
don't bother flying
in next weekend.

1423
01:05:35,615 --> 01:05:37,549
I mean, I really need to spend
Saturday and Sunday

1424
01:05:37,617 --> 01:05:39,380
figuring out
the new media buys

1425
01:05:39,452 --> 01:05:40,714
for the next round
of Gulden's tests.

1426
01:05:40,787 --> 01:05:41,811
Oh. Hey.

1427
01:05:41,888 --> 01:05:44,755
If you got to work,
you got to work, right?

1428
01:05:44,824 --> 01:05:47,657
I mean, how often does somebody
our age get the opportunity

1429
01:05:47,727 --> 01:05:49,058
that Kate has?

1430
01:05:49,128 --> 01:05:50,561
There's a team
player right there.

1431
01:05:50,630 --> 01:05:52,461
You guys,
team-shmeam.

1432
01:05:52,532 --> 01:05:54,557
Oh, you know what else,
though?

1433
01:05:54,634 --> 01:05:56,761
About your parents'
35th anniversary party?

1434
01:05:56,836 --> 01:05:58,064
Mmm?

1435
01:05:58,137 --> 01:05:59,695
I don't think I can
commit to the date, honey.

1436
01:05:59,772 --> 01:06:01,706
I'm sorry.
I just can't.

1437
01:06:01,774 --> 01:06:04,072
I don't know where we're going to
be with Gulden's at that point.

1438
01:06:04,143 --> 01:06:05,974
Don't worry about it.
I'm sure Mom and Dad will understand.

1439
01:06:06,045 --> 01:06:08,013
You can see them
on their 36th anniversary.

1440
01:06:13,586 --> 01:06:16,521
Darling, you know
what else on that other issue?

1441
01:06:16,589 --> 01:06:21,026
I've decided no babies until I
put in a good 10 years at the agency.

1442
01:06:21,094 --> 01:06:24,427
I mean, I think
I owe Mr. Mercer that.

1443
01:06:24,497 --> 01:06:27,523
You know,
I had a hunch.

1444
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:29,033
So that's why
next weekend-

1445
01:06:29,102 --> 01:06:30,535
when you're working,
of course-

1446
01:06:30,603 --> 01:06:34,539
I'm going to look into
that surrogate mother thing

1447
01:06:34,607 --> 01:06:36,768
we talked about, okay?

1448
01:06:36,843 --> 01:06:41,576
I mean, a man's gotto do
what a man's gotto do, you know?

1449
01:06:41,648 --> 01:06:44,549
Excuse me just for a second,
'cause I'll be right back.

1450
01:06:44,617 --> 01:06:45,549
Excuse me.

1451
01:06:45,618 --> 01:06:47,085
Hurry back, honey.

1452
01:06:47,153 --> 01:06:48,814
Oh, don't worry.
I will.

1453
01:06:48,888 --> 01:06:51,049
Okay.

1454
01:06:51,157 --> 01:06:57,062
Excuse me, I was wondering-Could you
dial a phone number for me?

1455
01:06:57,130 --> 01:06:59,792
Certainly,
Mademoiselle.

1456
01:06:59,866 --> 01:07:05,566
But I mean, even then, you know,
with all that, I still just knew.

1457
01:07:05,638 --> 01:07:06,935
My God, she was
20 pounds heavier.

1458
01:07:07,006 --> 01:07:08,564
I mean, that's hard
to imagine.

1459
01:07:08,641 --> 01:07:10,438
Yeah, it is, huh?
Hey, there she is.

1460
01:07:10,510 --> 01:07:11,841
Here I am.

1461
01:07:11,911 --> 01:07:13,105
Have a nice little chat
with yourself?

1462
01:07:13,179 --> 01:07:14,237
Yes,
I certainly did.

1463
01:07:15,315 --> 01:07:17,374
I think it's
in your purse.

1464
01:07:17,450 --> 01:07:20,442
Ha! It's ours.

1465
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:21,953
Hello?

1466
01:07:23,523 --> 01:07:27,960
Yes. Hold, please.

1467
01:07:28,027 --> 01:07:30,222
It's for you.
It's her.

1468
01:07:30,296 --> 01:07:32,059
Who her? What?

1469
01:07:32,131 --> 01:07:34,065
Oh, come on, Nick.
This is humiliating enough.

1470
01:07:34,133 --> 01:07:35,828
Would you just
take the phone?

1471
01:07:37,537 --> 01:07:40,471
Hello?

1472
01:07:40,540 --> 01:07:41,507
There's nobody there,
Kate.

1473
01:07:41,574 --> 01:07:44,304
Well, no, not now
there isn't. No!

1474
01:07:44,377 --> 01:07:45,901
Darling?

1475
01:07:45,978 --> 01:07:48,606
I thought that was over.
I thought she was out of your life.

1476
01:07:48,681 --> 01:07:50,444
I can't believe you.

1477
01:07:50,516 --> 01:07:53,974
I can't believe this.
I'm sorry. This is- Oh, God!

1478
01:07:54,053 --> 01:07:56,487
Well, maybe the rest of us
should go to the bar for a few moments.

1479
01:07:56,556 --> 01:07:58,080
No, no, no!

1480
01:07:58,157 --> 01:08:00,455
We-We-We can go
to the bar, please!

1481
01:08:00,526 --> 01:08:03,518
We can go to the bar.

1482
01:08:03,596 --> 01:08:06,121
Honey, why don't we go to the bar
where we can talk about this?

1483
01:08:06,199 --> 01:08:08,429
No. You go to the bar, Nick!
You go to the bar,

1484
01:08:08,501 --> 01:08:10,765
because that's where people go
when they want to meet people

1485
01:08:10,837 --> 01:08:12,771
other than their wives
and their fiances, isn't it?

1486
01:08:12,839 --> 01:08:15,933
And besides, you know what?
We have nothing to talk about

1487
01:08:16,008 --> 01:08:19,705
because we had an agreement
and you broke it!

1488
01:08:19,779 --> 01:08:23,215
And I don't think
I like you very much anymore!

1489
01:08:23,282 --> 01:08:26,115
Mrs. Mercer: You're doing
the right thing, honey.

1490
01:08:26,185 --> 01:08:27,948
Put your foot down now.

1491
01:08:28,020 --> 01:08:29,282
Thank you.

1492
01:08:38,030 --> 01:08:39,861
So I have a mistress.

1493
01:08:39,932 --> 01:08:42,526
You mean you admit it?

1494
01:08:42,602 --> 01:08:44,467
Yes.

1495
01:08:46,539 --> 01:08:47,972
I admit it.

1496
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:49,473
Okay.

1497
01:08:49,542 --> 01:08:51,169
Yeah, I admit it.
I'm not ashamed of it, okay?

1498
01:08:51,244 --> 01:08:53,576
And you know why
I have a mistress?

1499
01:08:53,646 --> 01:08:55,671
Because she has
a mistress, too.

1500
01:08:55,748 --> 01:08:57,648
She's gay?

1501
01:08:57,717 --> 01:08:59,241
What are you saying?

1502
01:08:59,318 --> 01:09:00,478
- You want to know what I'm saying?
- Yeah!

1503
01:09:00,553 --> 01:09:01,986
I'll tell you what
I'm saying!

1504
01:09:02,054 --> 01:09:04,784
I can no longer play sloppy seconds
to you and your job!

1505
01:09:04,857 --> 01:09:07,758
You are so in love
with Mercer Advertising!

1506
01:09:07,827 --> 01:09:10,091
It's all you do! It's all you
think about! It's all you talk about!

1507
01:09:10,163 --> 01:09:12,427
Son, I want you to lower
your voice and sit down.

1508
01:09:12,498 --> 01:09:13,863
Excuse me!

1509
01:09:13,933 --> 01:09:16,925
Do either of you know what it's like
to always be number two

1510
01:09:17,003 --> 01:09:18,937
in the eyes of
the woman you love?

1511
01:09:23,509 --> 01:09:24,942
I do.

1512
01:09:28,014 --> 01:09:29,811
Now I know
how Gulden's feels.

1513
01:09:31,451 --> 01:09:33,942
Katie, I can no longer compete
with this man and his company,

1514
01:09:34,020 --> 01:09:35,487
and I want out!

1515
01:09:35,555 --> 01:09:37,716
What! What!
No, no, Nick!

1516
01:09:37,790 --> 01:09:38,984
Nick, no. You
can't do this.

1517
01:09:39,058 --> 01:09:41,458
Young man, this is not
the time and not the place.

1518
01:09:41,527 --> 01:09:45,327
Excuse me!
I don't want to marry you, Kate!

1519
01:09:45,398 --> 01:09:48,231
Do you understand?
I don't want to marry you!

1520
01:09:48,301 --> 01:09:52,499
It's over! You hear me!
I don't want to marry you anymore.

1521
01:09:52,572 --> 01:09:53,971
Not today!
Not tomorrow!

1522
01:10:00,079 --> 01:10:02,013
Let me tell you
something.

1523
01:10:02,081 --> 01:10:05,744
You may be a hero,
but you're no gentleman.

1524
01:10:05,818 --> 01:10:06,910
Come on, Katie. Dinner's over.
Let's get out of here.

1525
01:10:06,986 --> 01:10:08,920
Okay.

1526
01:10:16,496 --> 01:10:19,863
You know, it's one thing to cheat
after a few years of marriage,

1527
01:10:19,932 --> 01:10:21,991
but while you're
still single?!

1528
01:10:23,803 --> 01:10:26,431
Shame on you!

1529
01:10:30,510 --> 01:10:33,946
Don't bother looking back.
He is out of your life.

1530
01:10:34,013 --> 01:10:35,378
Come on.

1531
01:10:53,533 --> 01:10:55,467
Hey, how's your leg?

1532
01:10:59,038 --> 01:11:00,471
Think I'll live.

1533
01:11:00,540 --> 01:11:01,973
Yeah?

1534
01:11:02,041 --> 01:11:05,169
Sorry. I got a little
carried away in there.

1535
01:11:06,979 --> 01:11:09,914
So I guess now, um...

1536
01:11:09,982 --> 01:11:11,540
Now your life's
perfect, huh?

1537
01:11:11,617 --> 01:11:15,417
Well, uh...

1538
01:11:15,488 --> 01:11:17,217
Yeah, actually.

1539
01:11:20,493 --> 01:11:23,428
That's great.
Really, that's great.

1540
01:11:30,603 --> 01:11:34,437
I never met anyone in my life that knew
what they wanted more than you do.

1541
01:11:38,010 --> 01:11:39,443
Is that a compliment?

1542
01:11:39,512 --> 01:11:42,447
Yes, it's a compliment.
Definitely a compliment.

1543
01:11:42,515 --> 01:11:43,447
Thank you.

1544
01:11:43,516 --> 01:11:45,541
You're welcome.

1545
01:11:59,532 --> 01:12:01,466
That Sam's
a lucky guy.

1546
01:12:04,971 --> 01:12:07,633
Make sure you tell
him I said so, okay?

1547
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:36,434
Aren't you supposed
to be with your boyfriend?

1548
01:12:36,502 --> 01:12:38,936
How in God's name did
you get rid of him?

1549
01:12:39,005 --> 01:12:40,939
Oh, it was awful,
so awful.

1550
01:12:41,007 --> 01:12:43,441
We had this huge fight
in front of everybody.

1551
01:12:43,509 --> 01:12:46,444
But it's okay.
It's over. We ended it.

1552
01:12:50,516 --> 01:12:52,450
What?

1553
01:12:52,518 --> 01:12:56,454
Well, I hope you
didn't do this for me.

1554
01:12:56,522 --> 01:12:58,456
No.

1555
01:12:58,524 --> 01:13:01,960
Egomaniac,
I did it for me.

1556
01:13:05,965 --> 01:13:08,399
Now, why are you over there
and I'm over here?

1557
01:13:08,467 --> 01:13:11,402
I just think you should take a breath
and think this through.

1558
01:13:11,470 --> 01:13:14,405
I mean, what you had with Nick
was really special.

1559
01:13:14,473 --> 01:13:18,409
Really?
You think so, huh?

1560
01:13:20,479 --> 01:13:21,912
Hmm.

1561
01:13:25,985 --> 01:13:27,418
You know what, Sam?

1562
01:13:27,486 --> 01:13:29,420
You're just always going to be
that guy at the restaurant

1563
01:13:29,488 --> 01:13:31,422
who, when he gets
what he ordered,

1564
01:13:31,490 --> 01:13:34,425
always wishes he got
what the guy next to him did.

1565
01:13:34,493 --> 01:13:36,927
Oh, wait, wait.
Come on, what are you doing?

1566
01:13:36,996 --> 01:13:37,928
Please don't
leave mad.

1567
01:13:37,997 --> 01:13:39,430
No, I should just leave.

1568
01:13:39,498 --> 01:13:40,931
What are you
talking about?

1569
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,934
Come here, let me make you
a nice cup of coffee.

1570
01:13:43,002 --> 01:13:44,936
You don't even know
how I take my coffee.

1571
01:13:45,004 --> 01:13:47,438
Well, you'll tell me,
and then I'll know.

1572
01:13:47,506 --> 01:13:49,440
No. Come on! No!
Will you just let me out of here?

1573
01:13:49,508 --> 01:13:50,440
Hold on,
this one sticks.

1574
01:13:52,011 --> 01:13:54,002
God, I'm so sorry.
Are you okay?

1575
01:14:11,731 --> 01:14:13,460
That was fast.

1576
01:14:13,532 --> 01:14:15,557
Sorry.

1577
01:14:15,634 --> 01:14:18,262
Jesus!

1578
01:14:19,538 --> 01:14:21,472
What happened, Kate?
Did he hit you?

1579
01:14:21,540 --> 01:14:23,474
No. Just like everything else
that sucks in my life,

1580
01:14:23,542 --> 01:14:24,474
I did it to myself.

1581
01:14:24,543 --> 01:14:25,976
Come here.

1582
01:14:26,045 --> 01:14:27,478
It's not a big deal.

1583
01:14:27,546 --> 01:14:29,480
What do you mean it's not a big deal?
You look like a raccoon.

1584
01:14:29,548 --> 01:14:30,981
I just need to get ice
on it, that's all.

1585
01:14:31,050 --> 01:14:31,982
Okay, I'll get you ice.
I'll get you ice.

1586
01:14:32,051 --> 01:14:33,484
Oh, I'm a big girl.

1587
01:14:33,552 --> 01:14:34,484
Sit down. Sit down.

1588
01:14:34,553 --> 01:14:35,986
Don't go anywhere.
Stay.

1589
01:14:39,058 --> 01:14:40,150
You have any steak?

1590
01:14:40,226 --> 01:14:41,591
No.

1591
01:14:41,660 --> 01:14:44,322
Well, I don't think this Lean Cuisine's
going to get it done.

1592
01:14:44,397 --> 01:14:45,489
Here.

1593
01:14:45,564 --> 01:14:48,590
By the way, your mother
called about 5 times.

1594
01:14:48,667 --> 01:14:50,999
I let the machine
get it.

1595
01:14:51,070 --> 01:14:52,002
Thank you.

1596
01:14:52,071 --> 01:14:53,003
They're peas.

1597
01:14:53,072 --> 01:14:54,505
Go ahead.
They' refrozen.

1598
01:14:54,573 --> 01:14:57,508
All right.
Ahh... no, no, no.

1599
01:14:57,576 --> 01:14:59,043
Okay? Aww.

1600
01:15:02,014 --> 01:15:03,675
Oh, God.

1601
01:15:03,749 --> 01:15:04,613
It's on the floor
under my shirt.

1602
01:15:06,519 --> 01:15:09,613
Hello? Hi, I'm fine.
I'm alive. Don't come over.

1603
01:15:11,524 --> 01:15:15,984
My floral dress, my snakeskin sandals,
and my beaded bag.

1604
01:15:19,031 --> 01:15:21,625
Yeah. Yeah. No.
They loved him, Mom.

1605
01:15:21,700 --> 01:15:24,464
It was
a great night. We...

1606
01:15:26,405 --> 01:15:28,464
I mean-but you know,
something happened actually. No.

1607
01:15:28,541 --> 01:15:31,874
And, um... Ma,
I gotta call you back.

1608
01:15:31,944 --> 01:15:34,606
Why did you do that?

1609
01:15:35,881 --> 01:15:37,473
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do.

1610
01:15:37,550 --> 01:15:38,812
Answer the phone.

1611
01:15:38,884 --> 01:15:40,476
No, I don't want to lie.
I don't want to lie to her.

1612
01:15:40,553 --> 01:15:41,645
Then don't.

1613
01:15:53,065 --> 01:15:53,997
Hi, Ma.

1614
01:15:54,066 --> 01:15:58,002
Yeah. No.
Uh, something happened.

1615
01:15:58,070 --> 01:16:00,004
I don't know
what happened.

1616
01:16:00,072 --> 01:16:03,508
No. I know, I know, Ma.

1617
01:16:03,576 --> 01:16:06,443
I do know what happened.
I just-I panicked.

1618
01:16:06,512 --> 01:16:09,913
Because I don't want you to be
disappointed in me.

1619
01:16:12,751 --> 01:16:14,480
Right.

1620
01:16:14,553 --> 01:16:17,954
I know that you think that I could never
disappoint you, but, Mom, let me tell you,

1621
01:16:18,023 --> 01:16:18,955
I could.

1622
01:16:20,526 --> 01:16:24,462
Oh, yeah, that's what you were
talking about, right?

1623
01:16:24,530 --> 01:16:26,964
Well, you know,
they mostly loved him.

1624
01:16:29,034 --> 01:16:31,468
Where is he?

1625
01:16:31,537 --> 01:16:32,970
Now?

1626
01:16:33,038 --> 01:16:34,198
Um...

1627
01:16:35,708 --> 01:16:37,972
Well, see, now, what do you mean
when you say "where is he? '

1628
01:16:38,043 --> 01:16:38,975
You mean, like,
physically now?

1629
01:16:39,044 --> 01:16:40,944
I'm
right here, Rita.

1630
01:16:41,013 --> 01:16:43,481
But, uh, you have to
promise not to be shocked

1631
01:16:43,549 --> 01:16:46,211
or think any less of
your daughter, okay?

1632
01:16:47,553 --> 01:16:49,646
Right now?

1633
01:16:49,722 --> 01:16:55,524
Um... Well, a pair of boxer shorts,
a t-shirt, and a smile.

1634
01:16:57,563 --> 01:16:58,530
Yeah?

1635
01:17:00,566 --> 01:17:04,229
Well, you know what, I am looking
at your picture right now, too.

1636
01:17:08,007 --> 01:17:09,440
Yeah.

1637
01:17:09,508 --> 01:17:12,238
Yeah, I, uh,
I like her a lot.

1638
01:17:13,512 --> 01:17:16,037
Well, in fact, uh...

1639
01:17:16,115 --> 01:17:19,448
I like her more
every minute I spend with her.

1640
01:17:22,521 --> 01:17:24,955
I'm gonna give you
back to Kate now, okay?

1641
01:17:27,026 --> 01:17:29,961
Well, I look forward
to meeting you, too, Rita.

1642
01:17:30,029 --> 01:17:31,291
Bye.

1643
01:17:37,036 --> 01:17:39,470
Listen, Mom,
I'm gonna hang up now, okay?

1644
01:17:42,041 --> 01:17:43,474
Oh, my God.

1645
01:17:45,544 --> 01:17:48,479
A diaphragm, a sponge,
and a rubber. Good-bye.

1646
01:18:21,513 --> 01:18:22,946
Thank you for that.

1647
01:18:49,541 --> 01:18:53,807
Macy Gray: Games, changes, and fears

1648
01:18:53,879 --> 01:18:58,248
When will they go from here?

1649
01:18:58,317 --> 01:19:00,808
When will they stop

1650
01:19:00,886 --> 01:19:04,054
I believe that lie,
and I choke

1651
01:19:04,123 --> 01:19:07,923
I try to walk away,
and I stumble

1652
01:19:07,993 --> 01:19:10,621
And though I try to
hide it, it's clear

1653
01:19:10,696 --> 01:19:14,154
My world crumbles
when you are not there

1654
01:19:14,233 --> 01:19:16,701
Good-bye, and I choke

1655
01:19:16,769 --> 01:19:20,170
I try to walk away,
and I stumble

1656
01:19:20,239 --> 01:19:22,173
And though I try to hide it

1657
01:19:22,241 --> 01:19:23,435
It's clear

1658
01:19:23,509 --> 01:19:26,137
My world crumbles
when you are not near

1659
01:19:26,211 --> 01:19:27,439
You're kidding.

1660
01:19:27,513 --> 01:19:29,413
His mistress showed up
right there at the dinner?

1661
01:19:29,481 --> 01:19:30,948
Yeah. I heard Kate
had a complete breakdown.

1662
01:19:31,016 --> 01:19:32,449
And then Mrs. Mercer
either punched him

1663
01:19:32,518 --> 01:19:33,951
or punched
the girlfriend.

1664
01:19:34,019 --> 01:19:35,486
I heard the guy
punched Mr. Mercer.

1665
01:19:35,554 --> 01:19:37,454
I heard it turned into a giant brawl,
everybody punching everybody.

1666
01:19:37,523 --> 01:19:38,751
Shh.

1667
01:19:41,627 --> 01:19:44,689
Morning.

1668
01:19:46,565 --> 01:19:47,497
See that?

1669
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:50,966
She looks like
Petey from Our Gang.

1670
01:20:11,490 --> 01:20:12,514
Hello.

1671
01:20:12,591 --> 01:20:13,922
You're still there.

1672
01:20:13,992 --> 01:20:16,927
No. I-nothing's wrong.

1673
01:20:16,995 --> 01:20:21,432
I just had this awful
feeling, uh,

1674
01:20:21,500 --> 01:20:23,934
that, um...

1675
01:20:24,002 --> 01:20:27,369
That you were gonna leave and I wasn't
gonna have a chance to say good-bye.

1676
01:20:29,341 --> 01:20:30,672
You know how you said,

1677
01:20:30,743 --> 01:20:32,938
um, last night about
coming down on the weekends-

1678
01:20:33,011 --> 01:20:34,103
Ahem.

1679
01:20:34,179 --> 01:20:38,445
Uh, you know what?
I gotto call you back.

1680
01:20:38,517 --> 01:20:40,280
Are you gonna be around for a while?
Can I call you back?

1681
01:20:40,352 --> 01:20:41,876
Don't go far.

1682
01:20:46,024 --> 01:20:48,959
That must have been quite a show
you put on last night.

1683
01:20:49,027 --> 01:20:50,961
It's all anybody's
talking about.

1684
01:20:51,029 --> 01:20:52,963
I like
the Audrey Hepburn thing.

1685
01:20:53,031 --> 01:20:54,464
Nice touch.

1686
01:20:54,533 --> 01:20:56,899
Everyone will assume you're still
crying your eyes out.

1687
01:20:56,969 --> 01:20:58,197
Yeah.

1688
01:20:58,270 --> 01:20:59,965
Uh, Darce, I really gotto
talk to you about something.

1689
01:21:00,038 --> 01:21:03,735
Well, Mr. Mercer and I, we have
something we'd like talk to you about.

1690
01:21:03,809 --> 01:21:06,334
What? What did I do?

1691
01:21:06,411 --> 01:21:09,471
Yeah, well, I'm pleased
you're pleased.

1692
01:21:09,548 --> 01:21:11,072
I know.
Absolutely.

1693
01:21:11,150 --> 01:21:12,174
Ahem.

1694
01:21:12,251 --> 01:21:14,583
Uh, hold on.
My troops are just arriving.

1695
01:21:14,653 --> 01:21:17,451
Yeah, I'll call you back.

1696
01:21:19,158 --> 01:21:20,352
Ladies.

1697
01:21:28,500 --> 01:21:32,436
Um, everybody okay?

1698
01:21:32,504 --> 01:21:35,439
Oh, well,
she's just... you know.

1699
01:21:35,507 --> 01:21:37,441
Good. Good.

1700
01:21:37,509 --> 01:21:40,945
We've just gotten the results from
Gulden's advertising test in Rochester,

1701
01:21:41,013 --> 01:21:44,949
and everyone is so pleased that they've
decided to launch nationally A. SA.P.

1702
01:21:45,017 --> 01:21:46,382
Oh, God!

1703
01:21:46,451 --> 01:21:48,942
Now, what this early go-ahead means
is that we've got a shot

1704
01:21:49,021 --> 01:21:50,955
at putting something together
for the Super Bowl.

1705
01:21:52,124 --> 01:21:54,957
Baby, the Super Bowl!
The Super Bowl, baby!

1706
01:21:55,027 --> 01:21:56,187
Oh, my God!

1707
01:21:56,261 --> 01:21:57,228
The Super Bowl.

1708
01:21:57,296 --> 01:21:59,093
Oh, wow.
Oh, there's the chest pain.

1709
01:21:59,164 --> 01:22:02,861
Davenport and his people are coming by
day after tomorrow to hear concepts.

1710
01:22:02,935 --> 01:22:03,959
Yes. God.

1711
01:22:04,036 --> 01:22:05,401
Can I have a tissue,
please?

1712
01:22:05,470 --> 01:22:07,904
Also-And this is
a little complicated for me,

1713
01:22:07,973 --> 01:22:10,407
but don't let it spoil
your good fortune-

1714
01:22:10,475 --> 01:22:12,705
Davenport has asked me
to move Sela out of the way

1715
01:22:12,778 --> 01:22:14,336
and to make you creative
leader on the account.

1716
01:22:16,982 --> 01:22:18,916
Whoa.
What happened to you?

1717
01:22:18,984 --> 01:22:20,110
Nothing.

1718
01:22:20,185 --> 01:22:21,914
Oh, no. Nothing.

1719
01:22:21,987 --> 01:22:23,420
Oh, it's not-This is not
what you think it is.

1720
01:22:23,488 --> 01:22:24,819
It's-It's...

1721
01:22:24,890 --> 01:22:26,915
I'm such a klutz. I was
getting dressed in the dark-

1722
01:22:26,992 --> 01:22:29,426
Look, I know that this
goes without saying.

1723
01:22:29,494 --> 01:22:32,429
Last night was very upsetting
for all of us.

1724
01:22:32,497 --> 01:22:34,431
I mean, no one more so
than you, I'm sure,

1725
01:22:34,499 --> 01:22:36,433
but everyone here is
working under the assumption

1726
01:22:36,501 --> 01:22:38,401
that this part of
your life is over,

1727
01:22:38,470 --> 01:22:41,928
that this person
is out of your life.

1728
01:22:42,007 --> 01:22:43,941
I mean, with
this big account,

1729
01:22:44,009 --> 01:22:47,945
we're all gonna be eating a lot
of dinners, going to a lot of functions,

1730
01:22:48,013 --> 01:22:50,447
maybe picking up
a clio or two,

1731
01:22:50,515 --> 01:22:54,451
and he is not someone
anyone wants to see again...

1732
01:22:54,519 --> 01:22:56,453
certainly not with you.

1733
01:23:25,484 --> 01:23:28,681
There's something
wrong with your phone.

1734
01:23:28,754 --> 01:23:31,917
No, uh, I waited by it
all day for you to call me back,

1735
01:23:31,990 --> 01:23:34,424
and when you didn't,
I figured it out.

1736
01:23:34,493 --> 01:23:36,927
There must be something
wrong with it...

1737
01:23:36,995 --> 01:23:38,724
Something wrong
with something.

1738
01:23:38,797 --> 01:23:41,925
Oh, Nick, I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

1739
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:43,934
I... I'm a terrible person.

1740
01:23:44,002 --> 01:23:46,937
It just sort of got
really crazy here today.

1741
01:23:47,005 --> 01:23:49,940
Well, um...
Good crazy?

1742
01:23:50,008 --> 01:23:52,442
Well, good crazy,
bad crazy.

1743
01:23:52,511 --> 01:24:00,441
Um... I kind of got this enormous
opportunity to, um, do a commercial.

1744
01:24:00,519 --> 01:24:01,952
That sounds good.

1745
01:24:02,020 --> 01:24:05,456
It is good.
It is good, very good.

1746
01:24:05,524 --> 01:24:06,991
Uh...

1747
01:24:09,027 --> 01:24:11,825
I mean, you know, as you
can see in front of you,

1748
01:24:11,897 --> 01:24:13,455
it's, um...

1749
01:24:13,532 --> 01:24:16,467
I'm gonna be working
like mad, you know,

1750
01:24:16,535 --> 01:24:18,469
and it means
a lot of late nights

1751
01:24:18,537 --> 01:24:25,966
and, uh, deadlines and,
uh, migraines, and, um...

1752
01:24:26,044 --> 01:24:32,381
Doesn't really leave a lot
of time for anything else.

1753
01:24:32,451 --> 01:24:35,284
Is that the official
change of subject that just went by?

1754
01:24:38,056 --> 01:24:40,991
It's just really bad timing
with this, Nick.

1755
01:24:41,059 --> 01:24:42,788
Really bad timing.

1756
01:24:58,577 --> 01:25:00,044
I want you to have that.

1757
01:25:07,019 --> 01:25:10,955
I haven't been around
nearly as much as you, Kate, but, um...

1758
01:25:11,023 --> 01:25:14,390
I'm pretty sure you're supposed to
leave that on the night table.

1759
01:25:14,459 --> 01:25:16,450
All right. You know,
don't say that, okay?

1760
01:25:16,528 --> 01:25:18,962
That's for your travel expenses
and your-your incidentals.

1761
01:25:19,031 --> 01:25:20,430
I know what it's for.

1762
01:25:20,499 --> 01:25:22,967
Well, what do you
want me to do, huh, Nick?

1763
01:25:23,035 --> 01:25:24,969
I mean, you want me
to just quit?

1764
01:25:25,037 --> 01:25:27,733
All of this just because you had one nice
conversation with my mother on the phone?

1765
01:25:27,806 --> 01:25:29,239
Okay. I'll see you
around, Kate.

1766
01:25:29,307 --> 01:25:31,468
Or what? Just lie? Tell them
it was a lie? It was all a big joke?

1767
01:25:31,543 --> 01:25:32,771
I mean...

1768
01:25:32,844 --> 01:25:33,902
That's a thought.

1769
01:25:33,979 --> 01:25:35,469
Oh, yeah.

1770
01:25:35,547 --> 01:25:36,980
Okay.

1771
01:25:39,151 --> 01:25:40,243
Thank you.

1772
01:25:41,553 --> 01:25:43,612
I'll leave your key
under your mat.

1773
01:25:46,058 --> 01:25:47,821
I mean, you know, Nick,
remember the plan?

1774
01:25:47,893 --> 01:25:49,793
You were just
supposed to go away.

1775
01:25:49,861 --> 01:25:50,987
Right?

1776
01:26:01,072 --> 01:26:04,940
Aimee Mann: I'm told the case
is now closed

1777
01:26:08,546 --> 01:26:11,947
So I can come to my senses

1778
01:26:12,016 --> 01:26:13,074
Hi, Mom.

1779
01:26:16,254 --> 01:26:19,417
But when the question
is posed

1780
01:26:22,827 --> 01:26:26,593
I'll have
this meager defense

1781
01:26:26,664 --> 01:26:33,797
I was hopin' that
you'd know better than this

1782
01:26:33,871 --> 01:26:40,868
I was hopin',
but you're an amateur

1783
01:26:40,945 --> 01:26:46,815
I was hopin' that
you'd know better

1784
01:26:46,884 --> 01:26:53,653
But I've been wrong before

1785
01:26:53,724 --> 01:26:55,487
Tracy's gonna kill me,
I'm so late.

1786
01:26:55,559 --> 01:26:57,493
Second Share
a cab downtown?

1787
01:26:57,561 --> 01:26:59,495
My boyfriend's
meeting me at PJ. Clarke's.

1788
01:26:59,563 --> 01:27:00,996
Can I bring Sarah?

1789
01:27:01,065 --> 01:27:02,930
Yeah, I suppose.

1790
01:27:11,509 --> 01:27:12,840
Carlos.

1791
01:27:16,013 --> 01:27:17,446
Hey, Kate.

1792
01:27:17,515 --> 01:27:18,447
Yeah?

1793
01:27:18,516 --> 01:27:19,778
It's gonna be great.

1794
01:27:19,850 --> 01:27:21,317
Thank you.

1795
01:27:23,020 --> 01:27:23,952
Hi.

1796
01:27:24,021 --> 01:27:24,953
Oh. Thanks.

1797
01:27:26,023 --> 01:27:26,955
Same thing.

1798
01:27:27,024 --> 01:27:28,457
That's two dollars,
please?

1799
01:27:30,027 --> 01:27:31,289
Hmm.

1800
01:27:32,530 --> 01:27:33,963
Okay.

1801
01:27:34,031 --> 01:27:34,963
Sorry.

1802
01:28:20,010 --> 01:28:21,534
I'm sorry, I can't-

1803
01:28:21,612 --> 01:28:24,945
I don't think I'm going to be able
to present this idea this afternoon.

1804
01:28:29,019 --> 01:28:30,953
Really?

1805
01:28:31,021 --> 01:28:32,454
Why not?

1806
01:28:34,525 --> 01:28:35,719
It's Nick.

1807
01:28:40,030 --> 01:28:44,091
Wait a minute. Nick, your, uh,
fianc, the fellow who cheated on you?

1808
01:28:45,536 --> 01:28:47,470
Right.

1809
01:28:47,538 --> 01:28:53,704
Right, except, uh, he was never my
fianc, and, uh, he never cheated on me.

1810
01:28:55,546 --> 01:28:59,983
Well, um,
I'm totally confused.

1811
01:29:00,050 --> 01:29:01,984
I know.

1812
01:29:02,052 --> 01:29:07,422
He was just this guy that I happened to
have a photograph taken with at a wedding.

1813
01:29:07,491 --> 01:29:09,925
I mean, I didn't even
know him.

1814
01:29:09,994 --> 01:29:13,930
He was just a stranger,
and when he got famous,

1815
01:29:13,998 --> 01:29:19,834
I went and I found him and offered him
money to come and have dinner with us.

1816
01:29:23,007 --> 01:29:30,937
I asked him to make a fool
out of himself, and he didn't want to,

1817
01:29:31,015 --> 01:29:34,451
uh, but he did it for me.

1818
01:29:34,518 --> 01:29:39,455
He did it to please me,
and I did it to please you,

1819
01:29:39,523 --> 01:29:40,990
and I'm sorry.

1820
01:29:41,058 --> 01:29:48,464
And I'm sorry most of all,
I think, that I convinced myself

1821
01:29:48,532 --> 01:29:56,337
that whatever talent I had meant nothing unless
it came in this package that everyone liked.

1822
01:30:00,044 --> 01:30:03,980
I guess you could say I was
dressing for the job I wanted.

1823
01:30:07,985 --> 01:30:09,714
I'll be out of my office
in 20 minutes.

1824
01:30:24,001 --> 01:30:24,933
Hey, hey.

1825
01:30:25,002 --> 01:30:26,936
Yeah?

1826
01:30:27,004 --> 01:30:29,438
There never was a Nick?

1827
01:30:29,507 --> 01:30:30,439
No.

1828
01:30:30,508 --> 01:30:33,443
You-You just
made him up?

1829
01:30:33,511 --> 01:30:35,445
Yeah.

1830
01:30:35,513 --> 01:30:40,450
And one of the reasons
was... to be with me?

1831
01:30:40,518 --> 01:30:42,952
Mm-hmm.

1832
01:30:43,020 --> 01:30:44,044
Wow.

1833
01:30:46,023 --> 01:30:46,955
Wow.

1834
01:30:49,026 --> 01:30:51,620
You-You really are
a bad girl.

1835
01:30:53,030 --> 01:30:54,520
I mean...

1836
01:30:56,534 --> 01:30:58,968
You really
are something.

1837
01:30:59,036 --> 01:31:01,470
Yep. I know.

1838
01:31:01,539 --> 01:31:03,404
I am something.

1839
01:31:05,476 --> 01:31:07,910
Oh, but you know, Sam...

1840
01:31:07,978 --> 01:31:09,809
I'm a good girl.

1841
01:31:11,482 --> 01:31:13,416
I think that's always
been our problem,

1842
01:31:13,484 --> 01:31:16,920
is, you know, I-
I'm just a good girl.

1843
01:31:16,987 --> 01:31:18,181
You sure?

1844
01:31:18,255 --> 01:31:20,416
Mm-hmm.

1845
01:31:25,996 --> 01:31:33,129
I tell you, though, if I ever change,
you're the first person I'm calling.

1846
01:31:39,510 --> 01:31:40,602
I hope so.

1847
01:31:53,023 --> 01:31:53,955
Okay.

1848
01:31:59,530 --> 01:32:01,896
Just, um...
couple of things.

1849
01:32:04,969 --> 01:32:09,906
You know, when I-when I applied
for my first job at Young & Rubicam,

1850
01:32:09,974 --> 01:32:12,875
I told them that I graduated
in the top 10% of my class.

1851
01:32:14,478 --> 01:32:17,072
Well, the truth is I was
lucky to graduate at all.

1852
01:32:20,484 --> 01:32:25,922
Oh. Why don't you take a few days off,
maybe- maybe go upstate,

1853
01:32:25,990 --> 01:32:27,924
maybe go to Massachusetts?

1854
01:32:48,512 --> 01:32:51,072
Hear that music? That means
the main event's about to start,

1855
01:32:51,148 --> 01:32:53,742
so you better get in your seat
so you don't miss it. Go ahead.

1856
01:32:53,817 --> 01:32:55,944
There she goes,
back to her seat.

1857
01:32:56,020 --> 01:32:57,453
Heh heh heh!

1858
01:33:08,465 --> 01:33:09,989
Thanks for the watch.

1859
01:33:16,473 --> 01:33:18,634
Ok, Nick, I'm sorry.

1860
01:33:21,645 --> 01:33:23,408
I'm working now,
you know.

1861
01:33:23,480 --> 01:33:26,415
I know. I just wanted
to tell you that, um,

1862
01:33:26,483 --> 01:33:28,041
I told everybody
the truth.

1863
01:33:28,118 --> 01:33:30,416
Well, that's...

1864
01:33:30,487 --> 01:33:32,045
that's great.

1865
01:33:32,122 --> 01:33:33,054
Yeah.

1866
01:33:33,123 --> 01:33:35,421
That's great.

1867
01:33:35,492 --> 01:33:36,857
Good-bye, Kate.

1868
01:34:08,025 --> 01:34:10,289
Would you all
please be seated?

1869
01:34:20,037 --> 01:34:21,231
Nick.

1870
01:34:23,540 --> 01:34:25,007
I-

1871
01:34:25,075 --> 01:34:29,478
Dearly beloved, we are
gathered here in the sight of God

1872
01:34:29,546 --> 01:34:32,481
and in the face of
this congregation

1873
01:34:32,549 --> 01:34:37,486
to join together this man
and this woman in holy matrimony,

1874
01:34:37,554 --> 01:34:39,613
and therefore, if any man
can show just cause...

1875
01:34:39,690 --> 01:34:42,989
Kate... I got to work.

1876
01:34:43,060 --> 01:34:45,893
Just... Kate, just go.

1877
01:34:45,963 --> 01:34:46,895
No.

1878
01:34:46,964 --> 01:34:47,896
Yes.

1879
01:34:47,965 --> 01:34:49,762
- Yes.
- No.

1880
01:34:49,833 --> 01:34:51,926
- No!
...forever hold his peace.

1881
01:34:58,075 --> 01:35:02,944
Daniel, do you have something
you'd like to tell me?

1882
01:35:05,015 --> 01:35:08,451
I've never seen that woman
before in my life...

1883
01:35:08,519 --> 01:35:10,180
Uh, I don't think.

1884
01:35:11,522 --> 01:35:14,150
Uh, Miss.
You back there.

1885
01:35:14,224 --> 01:35:15,452
He's talking to you.

1886
01:35:15,526 --> 01:35:17,960
Do you have something to say,
something to tell us?

1887
01:35:18,028 --> 01:35:18,960
No. No.

1888
01:35:19,029 --> 01:35:20,462
I'm sorry.

1889
01:35:20,531 --> 01:35:22,192
No. Holding
my peace.

1890
01:35:22,266 --> 01:35:25,099
Got away from me
for a moment, but holding it.

1891
01:35:27,538 --> 01:35:29,597
It's held.
I promise.

1892
01:35:32,543 --> 01:35:33,840
God.

1893
01:35:37,414 --> 01:35:39,473
Oh, my God.

1894
01:35:42,052 --> 01:35:45,988
Hi. Could you do me a favor
and hold this for me?

1895
01:35:46,056 --> 01:35:48,490
Just point it-Seethe bride
and the groom over there?

1896
01:35:48,559 --> 01:35:49,992
You know them, right?

1897
01:35:50,060 --> 01:35:53,154
Can I, uh... Miss?
Could we, uh...

1898
01:35:54,665 --> 01:35:56,462
Get over here.

1899
01:35:56,533 --> 01:35:57,522
Listen, Kate-

1900
01:35:57,601 --> 01:36:00,092
I know.
I was calculating and callous.

1901
01:36:00,170 --> 01:36:03,606
And manipulative
and condescending and...

1902
01:36:03,674 --> 01:36:04,936
Okay.

1903
01:36:09,012 --> 01:36:10,570
I miss you.

1904
01:36:18,021 --> 01:36:21,957
Look, I know
I don't deserve it,

1905
01:36:22,025 --> 01:36:25,893
but I would love
another chance.

1906
01:36:29,733 --> 01:36:35,467
You know, I'm not asking for,
like, a ring or anything, you know?

1907
01:36:35,539 --> 01:36:37,632
I just want a date.

1908
01:36:39,042 --> 01:36:40,669
You know, just a date.

1909
01:36:43,547 --> 01:36:45,538
I mean, hey, you know,
I know how you take your coffee.

1910
01:36:58,562 --> 01:36:59,790
Okay.

1911
01:37:01,565 --> 01:37:02,725
Okay.

1912
01:37:28,525 --> 01:37:30,049
You bunny hop?

1913
01:37:33,530 --> 01:37:34,462
Huh?

1914
01:37:34,531 --> 01:37:37,022
Well, after this
there's a reception,

1915
01:37:37,100 --> 01:37:42,436
and maybe after that we could
see a movie or... something.

1916
01:37:56,553 --> 01:37:59,488
Ladies and gentlemen!

1917
01:37:59,556 --> 01:38:01,148
Thank you.

1918
01:38:01,224 --> 01:38:03,988
Unless someone has something else to
say, I now pronounce you man and wife.

1919
01:38:04,061 --> 01:38:05,528
You may kiss the bride.

1920
01:39:12,996 --> 01:39:18,263
20 seconds
on the bad time

1921
01:39:18,335 --> 01:39:21,133
I'm a-feel you're on the run

1922
01:39:23,240 --> 01:39:26,505
Never lived too long
to make right

1923
01:39:28,412 --> 01:39:32,246
I see you're doin' fine

1924
01:39:32,315 --> 01:39:37,184
And when I get that feeling,
I can no longer slide

1925
01:39:37,254 --> 01:39:39,154
I can no longer run

1926
01:39:39,222 --> 01:39:41,053
Oh, no, no

1927
01:39:41,124 --> 01:39:44,525
And when I get that feeling

1928
01:39:44,594 --> 01:39:47,188
I can no longer hide

1929
01:39:47,264 --> 01:39:51,598
For it's no longer fun,
oh, no, no

1930
01:39:51,668 --> 01:39:54,432
Yeah, you can say
what you want

1931
01:39:54,504 --> 01:39:56,597
But it won't change my mind

1932
01:39:56,673 --> 01:39:58,937
I'll feel the same

1933
01:39:59,009 --> 01:40:01,477
About you

1934
01:40:01,545 --> 01:40:04,537
And you can tell me
your reasons

1935
01:40:04,614 --> 01:40:06,912
But it won't
change my feelings

1936
01:40:06,983 --> 01:40:09,417
I'll feel the same

1937
01:40:09,486 --> 01:40:11,249
About you

1938
01:40:13,156 --> 01:40:18,492
What I am is
what you want of me

1939
01:40:18,562 --> 01:40:22,931
Yeah, now that I'm not there

1940
01:40:22,999 --> 01:40:28,437
I took the tables
away from you

1941
01:40:28,505 --> 01:40:32,305
It's turning, I don't care

1942
01:40:32,375 --> 01:40:34,935
And when I get that feeling

1943
01:40:35,011 --> 01:40:37,479
I can no longer slide

1944
01:40:37,547 --> 01:40:41,108
I can no longer run,
oh, no, no

1945
01:40:41,184 --> 01:40:44,483
And when I get that feeling

1946
01:40:44,554 --> 01:40:46,954
I can no longer hide

1947
01:40:47,023 --> 01:40:50,959
For it's no longer fun,
oh, no, no

1948
01:40:51,027 --> 01:40:54,485
Yeah, you can say
what you want

1949
01:40:54,564 --> 01:40:56,759
But it won't change my mind

1950
01:40:56,833 --> 01:41:01,668
I'll feel
the same about you

1951
01:41:01,738 --> 01:41:04,730
And you can tell me
your reasons

1952
01:41:04,808 --> 01:41:06,799
But it won't
change my feelings

1953
01:41:06,877 --> 01:41:11,678
I'll feel the same about you

1954
01:41:11,748 --> 01:41:14,740
Yeah, you can say
what you want

1955
01:41:14,818 --> 01:41:16,877
But it won't
change my mind

1956
01:41:16,953 --> 01:41:21,413
I'll feel the same about you

1957
01:41:21,491 --> 01:41:24,483
And you can tell me
your reasons

1958
01:41:24,561 --> 01:41:26,893
But it won't
change my feelings

1959
01:41:26,963 --> 01:41:31,730
I'll feel the same about you

1960
01:41:31,801 --> 01:41:34,929
And when I get that feeling

1961
01:41:35,005 --> 01:41:37,030
I can no longer smile...
