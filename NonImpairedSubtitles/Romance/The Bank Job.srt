00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,061
Another "Terry Leather
Low Mileage" done.

7
00:01:43,161 --> 00:01:45,502
Good you're glad, but have you all
sorted out for your wedding tomorrow?

8
00:01:45,602 --> 00:01:46,745
Yeah, of course, Terry.

9
00:01:46,845 --> 00:01:48,922
New suit, two buttons,
9 inch pump flaps.

10
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,142
Nice.
<i>Ingrid will like that.</i>

11
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,454
So, you're getting
married tomorrow, Ingrid?

12
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,386
I hope so.

13
00:01:56,486 --> 00:01:57,483
Go on, get off now.

14
00:01:57,583 --> 00:02:00,400
Go make yoursef more beautiful
than you already are.

15
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,607
If that's possible.

16
00:02:03,707 --> 00:02:04,807
Terry.

17
00:02:04,907 --> 00:02:07,309
Promise you won't get Eddie
too legless tonight, will you?

18
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:08,512
At his stag do?
(bachelor party)

19
00:02:08,612 --> 00:02:10,612
We're just going round the pub,
couple of pints and a sing song.

20
00:02:21,512 --> 00:02:23,112
Oh, fuck...

21
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,615
Fuck it, what are you
trying to do to me, eh?

22
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,222
I've got Jessul's money.

23
00:02:32,322 --> 00:02:34,099
The Problem is,
it's tied up in these cars,

24
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:36,104
and you wankers want to
trash the lot of 'em.

25
00:02:36,204 --> 00:02:38,277
Mr. Jessul doesn't care about
your inventory.

26
00:02:38,377 --> 00:02:40,100
Mr. Jessul wants to know
that he's getting paid.

27
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,715
Any day, I swear, Perky.

28
00:02:42,465 --> 00:02:44,235
What did you call me?

29
00:02:44,335 --> 00:02:46,094
I called you Perky, Perky!

30
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,468
Everyone calls you Perky,
and him Pinkey.

31
00:02:48,568 --> 00:02:50,300
- Pinkey and Perky?
- Yeah.

32
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,228
They're fucking cartoon pigs
on the telly,

33
00:02:52,328 --> 00:02:54,521
what, people call us
that behind our backs?

34
00:02:54,621 --> 00:02:56,340
Well, I'm not gonna say it to your face,
aren't I?

35
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:59,136
Well, you just bloody did!

36
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:03,610
Yeah well, you got me rolled.
I'm very intimidated.

37
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,978
Don't make us come back again.

38
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:23,360
Not every customer is
a satisfied customer.

39
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,254
What are you doing
here, my dear Martine?

40
00:03:25,354 --> 00:03:26,424
What are you doing tonight?

41
00:03:26,524 --> 00:03:29,125
Tonight?
Tonight is Eddie's stag do.

42
00:03:29,275 --> 00:03:31,559
Taking him out for a drink.
Why?

43
00:03:31,659 --> 00:03:33,828
I've got a proposition for you, Terry.

44
00:03:33,978 --> 00:03:34,928
A proposition?

45
00:03:35,028 --> 00:03:37,124
Can you meet me at the Player's Club
before you see the boys?

46
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,628
And I'll fill you in on the details.

47
00:03:39,728 --> 00:03:40,983
Make it 9 o'clock.

48
00:03:41,483 --> 00:03:43,483
<i>[3 weeks earlier]</i>

49
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,142
- Morning, Gale.
- Good morning, Tim.

50
00:03:47,242 --> 00:03:49,918
Top floor?
Summoned by the gods?

51
00:03:50,018 --> 00:03:50,877
Something like that.

52
00:03:50,977 --> 00:03:52,696
Got up to your new
mistress this weekend?

53
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,930
I don't know what you're talking about,
I'm a married man.

54
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,845
What do you think,
am I presentable?

55
00:03:59,945 --> 00:04:02,624
Not sure about the tie, darling.

56
00:04:02,724 --> 00:04:05,547
What's this?
"Peace and Love"?

57
00:04:05,647 --> 00:04:09,656
Too much of that nonsense
and we're both out of our job.

58
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,992
Michael Abdul Malik.
Calls himself Michael X,

59
00:04:14,092 --> 00:04:16,869
in homage to Malcolm X,
his American counterpart.

60
00:04:16,969 --> 00:04:20,189
The Pinko (socialist) press would
have us believe this Michael X

61
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:22,849
is a crusading champion
of the poor and oppressed.

62
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,545
And the black Robin Hood
of Notting Hill.

63
00:04:25,644 --> 00:04:29,000
The richer, whiter and more famous,
they will all fall over him

64
00:04:29,099 --> 00:04:31,242
The truth is, he's a slum landlord,
a drug dealer

65
00:04:31,392 --> 00:04:33,806
and a vicious pimp who should have
been in prison years ago.

66
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:40,316
Are you not charging outrageous rents
to my brothers and sisters, Mr. Brown?

67
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:43,525
I'm charging the same as your
slum-lord friend Lew Vogel.

68
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:46,499
Ten quids a week is too
much for these shitholes.

69
00:04:47,299 --> 00:04:48,679
You know,

70
00:04:48,779 --> 00:04:52,675
I always wanted to meet
a white man by the name of Brown.

71
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:58,023
You know what this is?
It's a slave collar.

72
00:04:58,123 --> 00:05:00,610
And a white man made my mothers
and fathers wear this

73
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:02,210
to bend them to his will.

74
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,220
Can I bend you to my will,
Mr. Brown?

75
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,500
You sure got a faithful
dog now, Michael.

76
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,657
Michael, I don't think we
should get our hopes up here.

77
00:05:15,807 --> 00:05:17,221
Kidnappning, extortion,

78
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,485
assault on this man Brown here,

79
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,800
as well as your previous problems
with the law, I mean...

80
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,900
You could be looking
at 10 to 20 years, I'd say.

81
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,795
I don't think so. I am smarter
and better protected than whitey thinks.

82
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:30,189
<i>All rise.</i>

83
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,476
<i>It seems Michael X has managed
to keep himself out of jail</i>

84
00:05:36,576 --> 00:05:37,889
<i>by threatening to release</i>

85
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:42,000
damning photographs of a
certain...royal personage.

86
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,806
Until we get our hands on these snaps,
the police can't move.

87
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,443
The public prosecutor won't move...

88
00:05:50,543 --> 00:05:52,242
and the home office
doesn't want to know.

89
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,830
Has anyone actually
seen these photographs?

90
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:57,920
Yes, but at the minute
I'm not at liberty...

91
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,766
to say who that person is.

92
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,276
We've had Michael X under surveillance
for quite a while.

93
00:06:02,376 --> 00:06:04,028
He keeps a safe deposit
box at the Lloyd's Bank...

94
00:06:04,128 --> 00:06:04,596
in Marylebone.

95
00:06:04,696 --> 00:06:07,500
We believe that's were
the photos are located.

96
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,585
Seems straightforward enough.

97
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,827
I'll send a team into this bank

98
00:06:12,927 --> 00:06:14,786
and take whatever he's got
in this safe deposit box.

99
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,363
That would have to be sanctioned
at the highest level,

100
00:06:17,513 --> 00:06:19,347
and that's not going to happen.

101
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,435
Do you see our problem?

102
00:06:22,535 --> 00:06:25,436
There can be no connection to 5 or 6.

103
00:06:25,536 --> 00:06:27,003
So you want me to come up with something

104
00:06:27,103 --> 00:06:29,456
devoid any accountability for anyone.

105
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,502
We'd welcome suggestions, Tim.

106
00:06:31,602 --> 00:06:35,359
And if it all goes pear-shaped (wrong),
I assume it's my arse on the line?

107
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:39,712
You're young and ambitions, Tim.
A chance to make a name for yourself.

108
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,689
Thank you, Sir.

109
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,366
Excuse me, madam, miss.
Can I have a word?

110
00:06:50,516 --> 00:06:51,263
Yes.

111
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,500
- Where have you been?
- Morocco.

112
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:00,655
- I'll have to check your underwear.
- Be my guest.

113
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,697
- We found what we're looking for.
- Found what?

114
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,065
What were you looking for?

115
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,538
Oh Tim, thank God!

116
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,829
I'm in a spot of bother.
(I've got problems)

117
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,205
- What have you been up to?
- Nothing much. You?

118
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,416
I was in Morocco recently.

119
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,667
- Business or pleasure?
- Bit of both.

120
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,032
Drinks are on me.

121
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,442
So, we're gonna sit here all night,
making small-talk?

122
00:07:30,542 --> 00:07:34,559
I know you, Terry,
and I know your mates (friends).

123
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,900
You've always been looking for
the big score,

124
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
the one that makes sense of everything.

125
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,784
- I have it for you.
- What?

126
00:07:43,884 --> 00:07:48,921
- A bank.
- A bank...as in robber?

127
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,834
What would you know about a bank?

128
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:55,510
I've been seeing this guy
who runs his own business.

129
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:56,902
Security systems.

130
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:01,041
Next month, they're installing
new alarms in a bank at Marylebone.

131
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,360
Seems like the trains have been...

132
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:03,821
setting off the trembler
alarms in the vault

133
00:08:03,921 --> 00:08:05,714
and they've had to turn them off.

134
00:08:05,814 --> 00:08:08,362
So for a week or so,
they won't have any.

135
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:12,425
Now why would he tell you all this?

136
00:08:12,975 --> 00:08:14,927
We were having a laugh about it.

137
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:18,522
Imagine if half the villains in
in London knew about this, he said.

138
00:08:18,622 --> 00:08:21,059
And I thought, I know half
the villains in London.

139
00:08:21,309 --> 00:08:22,896
I grew up with some of them.

140
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,394
Look, me and my mates have been
involved in the odd bit of

141
00:08:26,494 --> 00:08:27,786
skullduggery (criminal acts).

142
00:08:27,886 --> 00:08:28,734
Can you see us tooled up,

143
00:08:28,834 --> 00:08:30,401
taking on a bank like
the (Jesse) James gang?

144
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,239
This isn't about waving a
waterpistol at a cashier's head.

145
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:37,086
This is about getting into the basement
where the deposit boxes are.

146
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,629
Hidden, secret wealth.
Money and jewels, they're safe to steal,

147
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:43,101
- 'cause people won't report it.
- Oh, no no no.

148
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,550
You can't talk about this here.

149
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:48,443
It's a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity, Terry.

150
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,600
We can't pass it up.

151
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:55,500
I didn't expect this
from you tonight, Martine.

152
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,283
What did you expect?

153
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,300
I'll have to think about it.

154
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,991
You better get off to your stag party.

155
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:11,339
Thanks for the drink.

156
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,500
Eddie tells me his brother invited you
to the wedding.

157
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:21,871
- Are you going?
- I'll see you there.

158
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,065
Can I get a Campari and Soda, no ice?
- Yes, sir.

159
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,508
Thank you.

160
00:09:39,758 --> 00:09:41,700
Well, Tim sweety,
what do you think?

161
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:44,085
- Is he offering?
- Maybe.

162
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,945
Cheers, gorgeous.

163
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,441
- So you're coming in?
- I don't know, it's late.

164
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:12,221
Do you need to run home
like a good little boy?

165
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,358
I guess I've got time.

166
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:34,143
- What exactly do you do?
- Bit of this, bit of that.

167
00:10:34,243 --> 00:10:35,820
How did you and Hakim meet?

168
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,592
I met Hakim in Los Angeles
last spring.

169
00:10:38,692 --> 00:10:40,887
He was rasing money for a black
Montessori school

170
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,352
and writing his life's story.

171
00:10:42,452 --> 00:10:44,466
And what an extraordinary
life it has been.

172
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:49,111
The book is called "From the Dead Level,
Malcolm X and Me."

173
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:51,737
I've read the manuscript.
Hakim is a poet.

174
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,862
The voice of the black soul.

175
00:10:53,962 --> 00:10:55,386
A friend is throwing a thing next week

176
00:10:55,486 --> 00:10:57,388
to celebrate the launch of
Brother Hakim's book,

177
00:10:57,488 --> 00:10:59,414
and you are all invited.

178
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:02,128
Hakim, tell us more about your book.

179
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,469
It's about being born black
in America.

180
00:11:07,569 --> 00:11:11,190
Can any of you imagine what it is like
to be born a black man in this world?

181
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:15,882
Can any of you white women
imagine what it would be like

182
00:11:15,982 --> 00:11:18,076
to bring a black baby into this world?

183
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,592
Good evening, sir.

184
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,401
What, you freakhead? Why are we 
even having this conversation?

185
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,337
We're not--

186
00:12:03,387 --> 00:12:04,645
Here's your beer.

187
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,444
We are <i>not</i> bankrobbers.

188
00:12:09,544 --> 00:12:11,900
Maybe that's why we
could get away with it.

189
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,888
It's a bit daunting, isn't it?

190
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,416
You know what scares me more?

191
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,923
Living and dying with
nothing to show for it.

192
00:12:19,069 --> 00:12:21,586
You know how old Mozart was
when he composed his first minuet?

193
00:12:21,787 --> 00:12:24,572
- No.
- Five. Five! A fucking minuet!

194
00:12:24,907 --> 00:12:26,585
And how would you know that fact, Terry?

195
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:29,744
Because it's tattooed on
that stripper's arse, Kevin.

196
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,054
What the fuck's it matter how I know?

197
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,032
It's a fact and you're
missing the point, Kev.

198
00:12:34,132 --> 00:12:35,168
What I'm trying to say is,

199
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,644
we stop fucking about and stop...

200
00:12:36,744 --> 00:12:38,367
picking the shit from
under our fingernails.

201
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,166
Shtum (quiet), lads.
Coppers at 12 o'clock.

202
00:12:53,866 --> 00:12:55,066
Damn...

203
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,341
What are you two doing here,
personally?

204
00:12:58,441 --> 00:13:00,561
I thought you were way past
being a bagman, Jerry.

205
00:13:00,661 --> 00:13:04,608
Your associate Sonia Bern has raised
prices at that knocking shop of hers.

206
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,575
- £120 quid up from a £100.
- And your point?

207
00:13:07,674 --> 00:13:10,356
A rising tide lifts all ships, mate.

208
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,783
I think we are owed some money.

209
00:13:12,882 --> 00:13:15,554
- Cause even Sonia's can be raided.
- Yeah, you would do that, wouldn't you?

210
00:13:15,654 --> 00:13:17,665
You'd kill the goose that
lays you golden eggs.

211
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,350
Wouldn't that be dumb, would it?

212
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:21,479
But then again,
everyone knows coppers are dumb.

213
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,991
Now you can do one thing for me.

214
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:31,242
You stop your collegues from
having their boys night out in my clubs.

215
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:39,274
They're loud, they're lewd (horny)
and they expect free oral sex.

216
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:44,925
You know what, that's disgusting.
My, most of them have families.

217
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,715
We'll pass the word along.

218
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,148
Lew, you tell your
greedy little bobbies (cops)...

219
00:14:02,248 --> 00:14:03,996
to find their
perks (extra income) elsewhere.

220
00:14:04,096 --> 00:14:05,623
No one is going to bother me.

221
00:14:05,723 --> 00:14:08,919
My patrons could have a lot of these
wank-cockers cut out of pasture.

222
00:14:09,019 --> 00:14:11,093
Well, I'd say, spread the wealth around
and keep the peace.

223
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,314
Five quid a week extra.

224
00:14:13,414 --> 00:14:16,270
- It's all it's worth.
- I'll pass it on.

225
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:30,795
- Drysdale.
- Urquhart.

226
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:37,100
Lord Drysdale, can I offer you a drink
before your session?

227
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,861
Very kind of you, Sonia.

228
00:14:40,961 --> 00:14:45,943
- Good to see you.
- As well, Urquhart, as well.

229
00:14:51,543 --> 00:14:52,843
Good girl.

230
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,685
Tighter!
Yes, that's a good girl.

231
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:03,731
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

232
00:15:16,431 --> 00:15:18,431
[Congratulations
Eddie & Ingrid]

233
00:15:18,531 --> 00:15:19,531
Louder.

234
00:15:20,231 --> 00:15:21,531
Louder!

235
00:15:21,831 --> 00:15:23,231
Come on.

236
00:15:30,431 --> 00:15:32,431
<i>We want a kiss,
what's wrong with you?</i>

237
00:15:34,031 --> 00:15:36,031
- I just can't.
- Come on...

238
00:15:37,031 --> 00:15:38,531
<i>Give her a snogging (kiss), babe.</i>

239
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,089
Hello.

240
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:58,776
So you were in a magazine the other day?

241
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,583
The Campari ad on the beach.
Nice.

242
00:16:01,683 --> 00:16:03,794
Must have been an old one,
I'm not modeling any more.

243
00:16:03,893 --> 00:16:06,989
I don't know why.
You're still a knockout.

244
00:16:07,088 --> 00:16:09,550
- What are you doing these days, Dave?
- Me?

245
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:12,723
A bit of film work.
Extra, you know.

246
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,757
And you, Kevin?
You're still snapping, I see.

247
00:16:14,857 --> 00:16:15,543
The wedding photos?

248
00:16:15,643 --> 00:16:17,182
No no, these are just
photos for the family.

249
00:16:17,281 --> 00:16:19,467
Fashion is my game.
Fashion and passports.

250
00:16:19,567 --> 00:16:22,449
- And the odd snap of a wayward husband.
- Thank you, Dave.

251
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,290
So, what's the verdict, boys?

252
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,100
We're interested.

253
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,964
First thing we should do
is take a look at the place,

254
00:16:29,064 --> 00:16:30,064
suss (check) it out.

255
00:16:30,164 --> 00:16:32,388
- Maybe open a box of our own.
- I've already done that.

256
00:16:32,487 --> 00:16:34,243
We can go and have a look tomorrow.

257
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,437
Tomorrow it is.

258
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,387
Heads up, lads.

259
00:16:40,486 --> 00:16:43,307
- She's adorable, your little one.
- She is off.

260
00:16:43,406 --> 00:16:45,421
And what a gorgeous flower girl
your eldest made.

261
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:46,943
Thanks. Catherine.

262
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,824
I do envy you.

263
00:16:49,924 --> 00:16:51,296
- Kev, you want to dance?
- Yeah, come on.

264
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,667
It was lovely to see you all.

265
00:16:52,767 --> 00:16:54,173
- Ciao.
- Ciao.

266
00:16:54,273 --> 00:16:56,273
- All right, mate.
- All right.

267
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:01,516
She envies me...
She's being sarcastic?

268
00:17:01,616 --> 00:17:05,639
I suppose what she meant was,
money can't by what we have.

269
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,075
Didn't you use to go out with her?

270
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:09,704
No love, that was Kevin.

271
00:17:09,804 --> 00:17:12,110
He had this big thing for her.

272
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:14,875
- And you didn't?
- No.

273
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,839
I love me and you,
love at first sight.

274
00:17:17,939 --> 00:17:18,939
Oh yeah...

275
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:23,276
I remember that night, you were
with your mate Audrey at that disco.

276
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:26,170
I saw this gorgeous little bum
in a pencil skirt

277
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,676
and I thought: 
"Oh, I've gotta have that."

278
00:17:28,776 --> 00:17:30,991
But Audrey surely already had blows,
so I pulled you.

279
00:17:31,141 --> 00:17:32,342
Cheeky sod.

280
00:17:32,442 --> 00:17:37,924
Daddy, daddy, come and dance with me.
Come on, dad.

281
00:17:54,624 --> 00:17:56,624
Hands off me.

282
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,120
Good morning.

283
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:23,620
I'd like to access my
safe deposit box, please.

284
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,796
- Martine Love. L-O-V-E.
- Certainly, madam.

285
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:45,593
- You're an actor, right?
- That's right.

286
00:18:45,693 --> 00:18:47,522
I did a couple of films
for you, Mr. Vogel.

287
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,543
Yeah, right.

288
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,569
So what are these films you're in?

289
00:18:56,669 --> 00:18:57,791
Forget about it.

290
00:18:57,891 --> 00:18:59,037
Go on.

291
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,931
Technically, it's what you'd call...

292
00:19:03,081 --> 00:19:04,461
pornography.

293
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,788
- You're joking?
- No.

294
00:19:06,888 --> 00:19:08,552
So you've been going around town with a

295
00:19:08,652 --> 00:19:10,627
12 inch mutton dagger
hanging down your pants?

296
00:19:10,727 --> 00:19:13,565
That's nothing to be ashamed of.

297
00:19:46,265 --> 00:19:47,265
Nice.

298
00:19:47,965 --> 00:19:48,965
Fake.

299
00:19:49,065 --> 00:19:51,580
For the posh party at the weekend.

300
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:08,256
This is the one.
The lease is available.

301
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,823
Finally.

302
00:20:18,924 --> 00:20:22,333
- How do I look? Good?
- Not your best, Dave.

303
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,867
Here we go.

304
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,238
So how come you've got the inside
note on this place, Martine?

305
00:20:27,338 --> 00:20:29,675
She knows this bloke,
runs a security company.

306
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,164
Bloke? Is it serious?
Are you getting married?

307
00:20:32,265 --> 00:20:35,376
He is married.
All the best ones are.

308
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:36,576
Here we go.

309
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:39,659
Marylebone Road and Baker Street,
on the corner here is the bank,

310
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:43,254
next door is the Chicken Inn,
and at 189, Le Sac.

311
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,080
In the back is an underground
car park

312
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:47,685
with direct access to
the shops' basements.

313
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,729
We can pull in here from
Glentworth Street...

314
00:20:49,829 --> 00:20:50,526
into the car park

315
00:20:50,626 --> 00:20:53,273
for dropoffs and pickups
without being seen from the street.

316
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,311
We'll dig a tunnel from the basement
of the shop

317
00:20:55,411 --> 00:20:58,572
under the Chicken Inn and pop up
in the safe deposit vault.

318
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,427
I've got a question.

319
00:21:00,527 --> 00:21:03,132
What do ourselves know
about digging tunnels?

320
00:21:03,232 --> 00:21:03,634
Nothing.

321
00:21:03,734 --> 00:21:05,429
But I know a man who does.

322
00:21:05,529 --> 00:21:09,092
- So what do you reckon, Bambas?
- What do I reckon?

323
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,149
I reckon I know you guys,
but I don't know her.

324
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:15,153
Don't worry about Martine,
she's solid.

325
00:21:15,254 --> 00:21:16,099
We go way back.

326
00:21:16,249 --> 00:21:18,751
Terry, you have been up to
some mischief in your time

327
00:21:18,851 --> 00:21:21,746
but this, this is serious shit,
my friend.

328
00:21:21,846 --> 00:21:23,623
Don't you think it's a little
out of your league?

329
00:21:23,723 --> 00:21:26,941
Maybe it's time to step up
to the first division.

330
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,270
There's going to be reinforced concrete
under the vault.

331
00:21:33,371 --> 00:21:36,676
We're going to need a thermic lance,
a jackhammer, a generator,

332
00:21:36,776 --> 00:21:38,559
lights, ropes, cables, the works.

333
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,867
It's about 40 feet (13m) of digging
before we're under the bank.

334
00:21:40,968 --> 00:21:43,153
We can hire some Micks (Irishmen) from
Camden Town to do the digging

335
00:21:43,254 --> 00:21:44,544
That's brilliant, Dave.

336
00:21:44,644 --> 00:21:47,110
Why don't we just pay their
national ensurance contributions?

337
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:49,737
And then you have to get on
your Tommy Nutter suit.

338
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,207
- This way, Michael. One more shot.
- This way.

339
00:21:53,007 --> 00:21:54,707
Thank you, that was great.

340
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:59,947
- What are your plans?
- I am returning to Trinidad...

341
00:22:00,047 --> 00:22:02,175
to liberate my brothers and sisters

342
00:22:02,275 --> 00:22:05,272
from the enslavement of
the British colonialists.

343
00:22:05,373 --> 00:22:08,426
What about the charges you are facing?
How can you leave England?

344
00:22:08,526 --> 00:22:10,578
They are liars and cowards.

345
00:22:10,678 --> 00:22:13,034
If they had anything against me
but their fear of me,

346
00:22:13,134 --> 00:22:15,099
I'd be tried and jailed.

347
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,656
See you later, Bambas.

348
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,395
But we gonna need a front man
on this,

349
00:22:18,495 --> 00:22:21,078
someone who can sign the lease on
the shop and looks the business.

350
00:22:21,178 --> 00:22:23,941
I know someone, Guy Singer.
Calls himself "The Major".

351
00:22:24,041 --> 00:22:25,841
But that's a lot of bollocks,

352
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:29,508
He has got this white posh accent
if anyone comes nosing about.

353
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,289
A bit tight under the
arms, dont you think?

354
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,551
Traditional fit, sir.

355
00:22:36,651 --> 00:22:38,643
One can't raise ones
arms above one's head.

356
00:22:38,793 --> 00:22:41,491
It tends to inhibit any
impulsive acts of surrender.

357
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,948
I'll be right back, sir.

358
00:22:47,048 --> 00:22:49,354
What on earth are you doing here?

359
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:52,805
Got a bit of business for you here, Guy.
You'll be tempted.

360
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,602
Sit down, luv.

361
00:23:03,702 --> 00:23:05,905
What do you think you're doing?

362
00:23:06,005 --> 00:23:07,649
Taking the E (Jaguar E-Type)
for a test drive.

363
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,397
Tell your boss, he can
have his inventory back

364
00:23:09,547 --> 00:23:10,932
when he settles Mr. Jessul's debt.

365
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,962
And it'd better be soon

366
00:23:13,062 --> 00:23:16,235
or we'll be back to tap
through his kneecaps.

367
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:21,456
If I was you two,
I was looking for another job.

368
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,587
Lovely.

369
00:23:28,687 --> 00:23:30,475
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

370
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:37,081
So, come on then, what don't I know?
Romantic dinner on a Monday night?

371
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:45,115
Look honey,

372
00:23:45,216 --> 00:23:49,436
I'm going to be working some strange
hours over the next week or two, so...

373
00:23:49,536 --> 00:23:52,990
don't ask me what I'm doing,
because I don't want to lie to you.

374
00:23:53,091 --> 00:23:55,146
What are you doing?

375
00:23:57,196 --> 00:23:57,940
Look...

376
00:23:58,041 --> 00:24:02,739
All llife I've caused us a few problems
with all these cars aren't selling

377
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:06,789
All I was trying to do
is get ahead of the game.

378
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:09,116
- This thing's gonna put us there.
- Wicked.

379
00:24:09,266 --> 00:24:10,248
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

380
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:13,030
And a better place.

381
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:15,269
It's for all of us.

382
00:24:16,369 --> 00:24:18,995
For you and the kids.

383
00:24:19,095 --> 00:24:21,369
And how afraid do I have to be, Terry?

384
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:31,360
It'd be the best smart thing if you
wanted to stay with your aunt,

385
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:34,989
in case things turn out cursed, that is.

386
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:47,114
So, we are settled. 25% to run
my girls till I return from Trinidad.

387
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:50,104
It's all right,
you don't have to worry.

388
00:24:50,204 --> 00:24:53,567
I'll look after your little flock
of birds like they were my own.

389
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:56,837
As long as you remember
they are not your own.

390
00:24:56,937 --> 00:24:58,144
Lew, while I'm back in Trinidad,

391
00:24:58,294 --> 00:25:00,156
I can arrange for shipment of some
high grade gunja (weed, marihuana).

392
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,786
Not interested.

393
00:25:01,886 --> 00:25:03,546
You want my opinion?

394
00:25:03,646 --> 00:25:05,298
All these drugs are responsible for...

395
00:25:05,398 --> 00:25:07,184
the moral decay of
this countries' young.

396
00:25:07,284 --> 00:25:09,898
Smut, smut and more smut.
(pornography, dirt)

397
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,720
That's my special area of interest.

398
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:12,781
You should think about it.

399
00:25:12,881 --> 00:25:14,576
With these goodies you can make
a lot of dough (money),

400
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,170
especially the police in your pocket.

401
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,068
I am paying enough pung as it is,
(weed, here: money) 

402
00:25:18,169 --> 00:25:19,928
but probably not as much
as you're donating

403
00:25:20,078 --> 00:25:22,600
to be permitted to leave our
fair shores (the country).

404
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:27,174
Not a shilling! I have something
so special, I don't need to pay anyone.

405
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,228
And what would that be, Michael?

406
00:25:29,328 --> 00:25:31,119
Sorry, Lew.

407
00:25:31,369 --> 00:25:32,627
Well.

408
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:35,756
Whatever it is, you can't be buggered.
I hope you're keeping it safe.

409
00:25:35,856 --> 00:25:40,243
Yes, as safe as it can be.
In a place that you recommended.

410
00:25:40,542 --> 00:25:40,542
transcript by r o g a r d

411
00:25:41,592 --> 00:25:43,776
- You're late.
- Sorry.

412
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:47,473
This is the Major.
Major Guy Singer.

413
00:25:47,573 --> 00:25:49,263
Final member of our team.

414
00:25:49,363 --> 00:25:51,505
I don't know this man.
Who are you?

415
00:25:51,605 --> 00:25:53,112
None of your business.

416
00:25:53,212 --> 00:25:55,584
No secrets around here.
The Major is a con artist.

417
00:25:55,685 --> 00:25:57,454
Usually elderly widows.

418
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,961
There's no need to bring that up.

419
00:25:59,061 --> 00:26:01,339
Now he's the official
new owner of Le Sac.

420
00:26:01,489 --> 00:26:03,746
Handbags and leather accesories
for the discerning lady.

421
00:26:04,446 --> 00:26:05,446
Nice.

422
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:08,260
I told the district planner's
office about the remodelling.

423
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:12,267
They gave me the specs for the
sewage, drainage, gas and power lines.

424
00:26:12,367 --> 00:26:15,143
Lifted our take
to miss that lot (a pipe).

425
00:26:15,244 --> 00:26:16,537
What's this for?

426
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,621
That is the thermic lance.
It cuts through concrete and metal.

427
00:26:20,721 --> 00:26:24,760
We're doing this, right?
I mean, we're bloody going for it.

428
00:26:24,861 --> 00:26:26,205
Let's see what this thing can do.

429
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,758
Good idea, Kev.
Give us a demonstration, Bambas.

430
00:26:28,859 --> 00:26:30,666
Ok, hold this.
Hold it. Here.

431
00:26:30,766 --> 00:26:33,271
Kevin, go stand over there
by the oxygene.

432
00:26:33,371 --> 00:26:34,871
Here we go.

433
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,196
Turn it off!

434
00:26:51,546 --> 00:26:53,126
Off! Off! Off!

435
00:26:54,326 --> 00:26:55,326
Not good.

436
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,169
They know what they're doing,
these people, do they?

437
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,872
Absolutely.
Professional criminals.

438
00:26:59,973 --> 00:27:01,542
What's the worst case scenario?

439
00:27:01,643 --> 00:27:03,222
They get caught and go to jail.

440
00:27:03,322 --> 00:27:04,672
No possible connection to us.

441
00:27:04,773 --> 00:27:06,751
What about this model you're screwing?

442
00:27:06,901 --> 00:27:08,789
What promises have you made
to keep her in line?

443
00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:10,706
None that can't be broken.

444
00:27:10,806 --> 00:27:13,246
Look, she's already tied
to the bank operation.

445
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,565
If things do go belly up (go wrong)

446
00:27:14,665 --> 00:27:17,266
it'll only take one
cut to sever the knot.

447
00:27:17,366 --> 00:27:19,473
What's Gale Benson up to?

448
00:27:19,574 --> 00:27:22,343
I believe she's working her way
into Michael X's inner sanctum.

449
00:27:22,444 --> 00:27:25,873
Could you sign that book, please?
I've got them finally together.

450
00:27:25,973 --> 00:27:27,338
Daddy!

451
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,836
I am so glad you decided to come.

452
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:35,598
This is my father, Sir Leonard Plugge.

453
00:27:35,698 --> 00:27:37,064
Always happy to meet Gale's new friends.

454
00:27:37,164 --> 00:27:39,145
Her new name is Halekimga.

455
00:27:39,246 --> 00:27:42,114
It's an anagram
of the letters of our names:

456
00:27:42,215 --> 00:27:43,838
Hakim and Gale.

457
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:47,339
- And your name is?
- Hakim. Hakim Jamal.

458
00:27:47,439 --> 00:27:48,439
Right.

459
00:27:49,639 --> 00:27:50,939
Excuse me...

460
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,925
Hello, gorgeous.

461
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,229
So, where's the author?

462
00:28:00,329 --> 00:28:02,379
He's over there,
signing his masterpiece.

463
00:28:02,479 --> 00:28:04,439
Why don't you both drop by
the house this weekend

464
00:28:04,489 --> 00:28:06,339
and introduce Mr. Jamal to mother?

465
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,894
Sorry daddy, can't do that.

466
00:28:07,994 --> 00:28:10,484
We're popping (going) on time
for the islands for a while.

467
00:28:10,584 --> 00:28:14,997
- Let me get you a drink.
- Good luck with your book.

468
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:21,151
- So you've read this book of his?
- You must be joking.

469
00:28:21,251 --> 00:28:23,741
Right.
You're probably undercover,

470
00:28:23,842 --> 00:28:27,287
spying on Black Power's insidious
threat to the British way of life.

471
00:28:27,387 --> 00:28:28,481
Oh, that's very funny.

472
00:28:28,831 --> 00:28:31,427
Tell me, is that little enterprise
still shipshape (going well)?

473
00:28:31,527 --> 00:28:33,063
We're currently on schedule, Tim.

474
00:28:33,164 --> 00:28:36,034
We're taking over the shop
on Friday afternoon.

475
00:28:36,135 --> 00:28:38,523
I know if this stuffs up
I'm in poo poo land.

476
00:28:38,623 --> 00:28:40,623
(I know that I'm in serious trouble
if this goes wrong)

477
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,570
We have a blue Transit van
that's just pulled up.

478
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,592
"Clacy Builders" on the side.

479
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,228
And we have one man entering the shop.

480
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,119
Construction crew, for Le Sac.

481
00:29:49,719 --> 00:29:51,719
[Under new management.
Reopening soon]

482
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,988
I've got a question.

483
00:30:18,088 --> 00:30:20,238
What do we do with all the dirt 
we're gonna dig out of the hole?

484
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:21,690
That's all been worked out, Dave.

485
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:25,355
We'll dig another hole over there 
and put in in that. Over.

486
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:29,308
If we're to get the job done
before the bank opens on Monday morning,

487
00:30:29,409 --> 00:30:30,426
we better get a wriggle (move) on.

488
00:30:30,576 --> 00:30:31,784
Want to do the honours, Martine?

489
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:36,867
This is it,
here we go.

490
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,640
Watch your nails, Martine.

491
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:39,740
Yeah, yeah.

492
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:42,640
Let's get this store to rock.

493
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:07,214
- Some racket (noise) there is.
- Bloody hell! What's going on?

494
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:26,397
Dave, come on, mate.

495
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:36,388
Dave, you need a break.
I'll take over.

496
00:31:36,538 --> 00:31:38,154
Cheers (thanks), Major.

497
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,846
Heads up!

498
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:51,059
- Where's Dave?
- No idea.

499
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,943
Where did you get to?

500
00:31:57,044 --> 00:31:58,754
Just checking the door was locked.

501
00:31:58,854 --> 00:32:01,688
Of course it's locked, Dave.
I locked it.

502
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,282
Hang on.
Look what we got here.

503
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,998
This is a copper.

504
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:15,121
Christ, he's not going in there, is he?

505
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,603
- I'll go.
- Shit! Dave, Dave, get back.

506
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,393
- I only wanted--
- Stop! Hold it down!

507
00:32:21,543 --> 00:32:22,731
Someone is knocking.
Someone is at the door.

508
00:32:22,831 --> 00:32:24,831
Stop, Stop! There's somebody
at the door of the shop.

509
00:32:25,631 --> 00:32:27,038
Bambas!

510
00:32:27,138 --> 00:32:29,138
Bambas!
Hold on!

511
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:32,078
There's somebody at the door.

512
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:38,634
- Look, I don't want to go in.
- It's my job.

513
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,370
Coppers.

514
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:49,970
It's the old bill (police).

515
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:00,426
Good evening.
You're working late?

516
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:03,709
Around the clock, officer.
Expanding our storage.

517
00:33:03,809 --> 00:33:05,253
Trying to complete renovations
for the grand reopening--

518
00:33:05,403 --> 00:33:06,714
If you don't mind, sir.

519
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,361
Excuse me?

520
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,723
You use a jackhammer down there?

521
00:33:15,823 --> 00:33:18,103
Yeah. You heard some
complaints, officer?

522
00:33:18,203 --> 00:33:20,000
Yeah, from some of your neighbours.

523
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,679
We'll try to keep it down, all right?

524
00:33:25,579 --> 00:33:26,579
Right.

525
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,944
How the hell did they
talk their way out of that one?

526
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,953
Tim, Quinn here.

527
00:33:36,703 --> 00:33:39,191
We just had a copper
going into the shop.

528
00:33:39,291 --> 00:33:41,410
<i>Not sure why, but he's gone now.</i>

529
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,006
All clear.

530
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,918
We need a lookout,
someone on a roof somewhere.

531
00:33:49,019 --> 00:33:51,783
- We've got the walkie-talkies.
- What about Eddie?

532
00:33:51,884 --> 00:33:53,226
He's a good lad,
we can trust him.

533
00:33:53,327 --> 00:33:54,986
No. Look, we're not cutting
anyone else in.

534
00:33:55,086 --> 00:33:56,490
We won't cut him in on the loot.

535
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,078
We'll give him the car lot.

536
00:33:58,178 --> 00:34:00,601
Hopefully I won't need
that headache anymore.

537
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,525
- My God, not again.
- Get up there, Major.

538
00:34:03,625 --> 00:34:04,855
Cover that up!

539
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:13,154
It's not the coppers.

540
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,526
- Yes, can I help you?
- Delivery for Dave Shilling.

541
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:24,600
- And what is it?
- Chicken and chips.

542
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,763
I see...

543
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:35,166
- Takeaway for Mr. Shilling.
- Thanks.

544
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:39,395
- You can't be serious.
- I was starving.

545
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:55,467
Radio is in the bag,
binoculars as well.

546
00:34:55,567 --> 00:34:57,385
There's a pension on the
top floor of this building,

547
00:34:57,486 --> 00:34:59,109
paid for the week.

548
00:34:59,209 --> 00:35:00,546
There's a ladder that'll
get you to the roof.

549
00:35:00,646 --> 00:35:02,551
You're in from Liverpool,
looking for work.

550
00:35:02,651 --> 00:35:03,891
I don't have a Liverpool accent.

551
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,725
Then don't talk to anyone, Eddie.

552
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,662
I'm up on the roof, and...

553
00:35:48,762 --> 00:35:50,272
I've got a good view

554
00:35:50,372 --> 00:35:51,748
<i>of all directions, over.</i>

555
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:55,977
Are you in position, Nightjar?
Command HQ here. Acknowledge.

556
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:59,237
Yeah, I'm in position.
I can see the front of the bank,

557
00:35:59,337 --> 00:36:01,305
Marylebone Road,

558
00:36:01,406 --> 00:36:03,827
Baker Street, I can see
everything really well.

559
00:36:03,927 --> 00:36:06,623
<i>All clear on the Western front, Guy.
Over.</i>

560
00:36:06,723 --> 00:36:09,865
- No names, Eddie.
<i>- Sorry, Dave.<i>

561
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:13,155
Aye, you delinquents.
What have I told you?

562
00:36:13,305 --> 00:36:14,630
<i>No idle chitchat.</i>

563
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:17,130
Sorry, T--
Over.

564
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:18,630
Fuckin' hell...

565
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,133
Wakey wakey, gentlemen.

566
00:36:25,233 --> 00:36:27,188
I'll keep an eye on
the shop from here on.

567
00:36:27,289 --> 00:36:29,071
You two go down to Glentworth Street.

568
00:36:29,171 --> 00:36:30,596
Guard the parking garage exit.

569
00:36:30,697 --> 00:36:31,947
Okay.

570
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:53,583
Nightjar here, there's some fellow
looking through the window.

571
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,183
<i>Hang on.</i>

572
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:00,999
Wait, hang on. He's going.
He's going.

573
00:37:01,499 --> 00:37:02,999
Yeah, he's gone.
Over.

574
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:08,219
Roger, Nightjar.
Over and out.

575
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:11,155
I want to go to the pub,
grab some more smokes.

576
00:37:11,605 --> 00:37:13,126
Do you want anything?

577
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:15,785
A pack of Seniors.

578
00:37:15,885 --> 00:37:17,405
There you go, sir.

579
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,471
Two packets of Rothmans,

580
00:37:19,571 --> 00:37:21,726
2 Senior Service and 8 bags of crisps.

581
00:37:21,826 --> 00:37:22,534
Okay.

582
00:37:22,684 --> 00:37:25,294
Hello, gorgeous.
Are we still on track?

583
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:28,278
We had a scare last night.
The cops came round.

584
00:37:28,378 --> 00:37:30,510
Can't you pull rank and make
sure it doesn't happen again?

585
00:37:30,611 --> 00:37:33,825
No, we can't show our hand.
We're invisible, remember?

586
00:37:33,926 --> 00:37:36,740
- I wish I was.
- How about your friend Terry?

587
00:37:36,841 --> 00:37:39,061
Where is he planning to
carve up the proceeds?

588
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,691
Shit.

589
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:47,985
- A pint of ale, chief.
- What's wrong?

590
00:37:48,085 --> 00:37:50,092
I needed to take a break.

591
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,226
Who's that you've been talking to?

592
00:37:52,326 --> 00:37:55,087
I wasn't.
He was trying to chat me up.

593
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,254
Does happen, you know.

594
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,987
- Right.
<i>- Here you are.</i>

595
00:38:00,087 --> 00:38:02,485
- Cheers. Keep the change.
<i>- Thank you.</i>

596
00:38:02,585 --> 00:38:05,919
Now, what are you doing here?
Are you following me?

597
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:07,943
No.

598
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:12,489
- I just wanted a pint.
- Then enjoy it.

599
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,602
- Hello, Gale.
- Where have you been?

600
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,153
You're rather impressed with our
friend Hakim, aren't you?

601
00:38:45,253 --> 00:38:48,551
I know rule #1:
"Don't get emotionally involved"

602
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:51,532
That doesn't mean I can't
enjoy my work.

603
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:53,327
You certainly do.

604
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:57,972
What does your father think of your
consorting with these radicals anyway?

605
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,397
We are not amused.

606
00:39:00,247 --> 00:39:02,127
Of course, if he knew
what I was really up to,

607
00:39:02,227 --> 00:39:03,627
he would have a heart attack.

608
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:07,307
Here you are.
Credit cards and cash.

609
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:10,256
If he does have copies of the
photos and negatives there,

610
00:39:10,356 --> 00:39:11,148
they will be hidden.

611
00:39:11,248 --> 00:39:12,832
Find them.
Destroy them.

612
00:39:12,932 --> 00:39:14,745
And then get out.

613
00:39:14,845 --> 00:39:16,748
Michael X thinks he's safe,
tucked away in Trinidad.

614
00:39:16,898 --> 00:39:18,941
That will all change if
we're successful here.

615
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,996
Just remember, Gale:
He's a nasty piece of work.

616
00:39:22,096 --> 00:39:27,058
He's a crazy dope-smoking lunatic
pimp extortionist, that's what he is.

617
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:32,021
Everything okay, Nightjar?
Anything I need to know?

618
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:35,137
Yeah, everything's all right, mate.

619
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,636
Listen, what if I want to go
for a pee up here?

620
00:39:37,736 --> 00:39:40,307
<i>I don't know.
Use your imagination.</i>

621
00:39:40,407 --> 00:39:43,730
<i>Stay off the radio unless you
see any old bill (police), all right?</i>

622
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,271
<i>Yeah, all right. If I see any
old bill, I'll let you know.</i>

623
00:39:47,871 --> 00:39:49,871
<i>I'll speak to you in a bit.
Over.</i>

624
00:39:57,471 --> 00:39:58,271
Hey Bambas.

625
00:39:58,460 --> 00:39:59,903
What's all this brickwork?

626
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:03,494
I don't know,
it wasn't on the plans.

627
00:40:03,594 --> 00:40:04,594
Fuck!

628
00:40:06,394 --> 00:40:07,894
<i>Terry?
Fucking hell!</i>

629
00:40:09,394 --> 00:40:11,094
<i>Terry!
Bambas!</i>

630
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,672
Terry, talk to me!

631
00:40:15,272 --> 00:40:16,022
Terry!

632
00:40:16,122 --> 00:40:17,872
Oh fuck..

633
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:21,207
<i>Terry, talk to me!</i>

634
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:26,794
<i>- Are you all right?</i>
- I think so, yeah.

635
00:40:26,895 --> 00:40:28,105
What happened?

636
00:40:29,155 --> 00:40:30,816
<i>The floor just caved in.</i>

637
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:33,194
Bloody hell, Terry.
Don't do that to me.

638
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:34,500
- I thought you was a goner (dead).
- Yeah.

639
00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:36,743
Give us a light, Dave.

640
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,287
What's down there?

641
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:44,369
- It's a pile of skeletons.
<i>- You're joking.</i>

642
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:48,570
<i>Let's hope they're not the last gang
who tried to take this bank.</i>

643
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:55,348
Latin.
Roughly translated:

644
00:40:55,448 --> 00:40:57,676
Lamb of God,
forgive us our sins.

645
00:40:57,776 --> 00:41:00,718
- You actually know Latin?
- Catholic school.

646
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:03,144
The Bleeding Heart sisters
of eternal misery.

647
00:41:03,244 --> 00:41:05,353
Interesting date.
1665.

648
00:41:05,453 --> 00:41:06,976
You all know what year
that was, don't you?

649
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,837
The last time West Ham
won the (F.A.) cup?

650
00:41:08,937 --> 00:41:11,193
It was the great plague of London.

651
00:41:11,293 --> 00:41:13,394
This must be a
burial chamber.

652
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,324
A crypt where they dumped the bodies.

653
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,559
Well, if these poor
bastards had the plague,

654
00:41:17,659 --> 00:41:19,109
then they could be infectious.

655
00:41:19,209 --> 00:41:20,706
I don't think so, Dave.

656
00:41:20,806 --> 00:41:23,111
This crypt goes all
the way under the bank.

657
00:41:23,211 --> 00:41:24,743
It'll put us in the vault quicker.

658
00:41:24,843 --> 00:41:28,480
Well, then we'll gonna do that.

659
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,663
Concrete.

660
00:41:45,763 --> 00:41:47,881
Floor of the vault.

661
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:50,117
Time to get paid for all our work.

662
00:41:50,267 --> 00:41:50,961
Right.

663
00:41:51,062 --> 00:41:53,871
If we hit the restaurant by mistake,
we'll be knee-deep in fried chicken.

664
00:41:54,671 --> 00:41:56,671
I'll be happy if we don't
hit the sewage.

665
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,340
When are you guys
going to hit the vault?

666
00:42:45,490 --> 00:42:47,209
<i>I'm freezing my tits off up here.
Over.</i>

667
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:50,056
<i>In the army, soldiers would pull on</i>

668
00:42:50,206 --> 00:42:52,633
<i>their puds (penises) to keep their blood flowing.
How's that?</i>

669
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:55,509
What regiment were you in,
the Royal Corps of Wankers?

670
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:57,097
Over.

671
00:42:57,247 --> 00:43:00,261
<i>Yes, we welcome new members.
Roger, over and out.</i>

672
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:03,670
<i>Emergency operator.
Which service do you require?</i>

673
00:43:03,770 --> 00:43:06,868
- The police, please.
<i>- Putting you through.</i>

674
00:43:06,968 --> 00:43:08,255
<i>Police here.
Can I help you?</i>

675
00:43:08,355 --> 00:43:09,829
Yes.
I'm a HAM radio operator

676
00:43:09,979 --> 00:43:12,806
and I think I may be overhearing
a robbery in progress.

677
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:29,093
We're in!
Dave, get the ladder.

678
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:06,623
We're gonna move into the vault
after we take a break.

679
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:09,051
Later when the fume's cleared out.

680
00:44:09,201 --> 00:44:11,083
You're having a laugh, ain't you?
Let's go in now.

681
00:44:11,183 --> 00:44:15,316
Dave. Nothing's going nowhere.
I can hardly breathe in there.

682
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:19,438
- Nightjar, are you there? Over.
- Nightjar here, over.

683
00:44:19,539 --> 00:44:21,169
<i>We're in.
Over.</i>

684
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:23,988
What, in the actual vault?

685
00:44:24,088 --> 00:44:25,629
Yes, in the actual vault. Over.

686
00:44:25,729 --> 00:44:28,990
Great, great.
That's great news. Over.

687
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:31,498
We're taking a break.
We're knackered (tired).

688
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:32,820
<i>I need to get some sleep.</i>

689
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:35,082
<i>Getting a shut-eye (a nap). I want
the fumes cleared out. Over.</i>

690
00:44:35,182 --> 00:44:39,460
<i>Lucky you. My eyes are like
**** stops. Over.</i>

691
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:42,056
<i>We can smell the money now.
Over.</i>

692
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:44,862
Look, money may be your god,
but it ain't mine, all right?

693
00:44:44,962 --> 00:44:48,442
I want a warm bath and a cup of tea.
Over.

694
00:44:48,542 --> 00:44:51,284
You'll get your cup of tea.
Just your odd time.

695
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:54,466
<i>Lucky you.
My eyes are like **** stops.</i>

696
00:44:54,566 --> 00:44:56,822
<i>We can smell the money now.</i>

697
00:44:56,922 --> 00:44:58,782
I rang 4 other police
stations before you,

698
00:44:58,932 --> 00:45:00,348
but nobody took me sriously.

699
00:45:00,448 --> 00:45:02,553
They said it was probably a hoax.

700
00:45:02,654 --> 00:45:04,540
How strong was the signal, Mr. Addey?

701
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,675
I'd say they were within
a 10 mile radius.

702
00:45:06,775 --> 00:45:09,684
There must be a ton of
banks in that area.

703
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:11,680
And when was the last time
you picked them up?

704
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:14,101
They've been quiet for about an hour.

705
00:45:14,201 --> 00:45:16,503
What about releasing the tapes
to the radio and TV?

706
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,297
Maybe somebody can recognize the voices?

707
00:45:18,397 --> 00:45:19,014
No, no.

708
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:21,792
If they hear themselves,
they'll stop transmitting.

709
00:45:21,892 --> 00:45:23,393
No, we should keep listening.

710
00:45:23,493 --> 00:45:25,384
Maybe they'll reveal where they are.

711
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,953
Alfie, you stay here with Mr. Addey.
I am going back to the station.

712
00:45:28,053 --> 00:45:30,399
You call me if you hear anything.

713
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:30,389
<i>Hi.</i>

714
00:46:34,439 --> 00:46:36,555
You scared the piss out of me.

715
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:42,094
- What are you doing here?
- I couldn't sleep.

716
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:46,382
Yeah, I'm a bit tingly
(nervous) myself..

717
00:46:46,482 --> 00:46:50,397
I just had to come and have a look.
Our future is in those boxes.

718
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:57,882
So, what are you going to do
with your share?

719
00:46:57,982 --> 00:47:01,432
Vanish.
Martine Love will cease to exist.

720
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:07,723
Why, do you think if you
vanish you'll become someone else?

721
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:10,516
At least no one will know
who I was.

722
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:15,924
Why did you pick Kevin and me?
You could have found better thieves.

723
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,936
For old times' sake.

724
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:22,940
Must be old times
you spent with Kevin,

725
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:24,885
not me.

726
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,397
Kevin has it in his mind that
we had this passionate affair.

727
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:29,934
The truth is, it came down

728
00:47:30,084 --> 00:47:32,598
to 4 chinese meals and
a roll in the hay.

729
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,827
And that was a long time ago.

730
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:18,558
All right,

731
00:48:18,658 --> 00:48:20,158
let's make some money.

732
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:40,343
Look at this!

733
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:43,707
Look at all this cash.

734
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:45,952
Fantastic!

735
00:48:46,052 --> 00:48:47,452
Guys? Gold bars.

736
00:48:47,852 --> 00:48:49,252
Diamonds. Diamonds!

737
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:00,632
Guys, what's going on?

738
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:03,812
How would your wife fancy a tiara?

739
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,156
Too bloody right.

740
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:09,899
<i>Get the gas.
The gas.</i>

741
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,606
<i>Look at it.
Hold it.</i>

742
00:49:11,706 --> 00:49:13,706
- Emerald.
- It's like winning the lottery.

743
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:29,587
Dave.
Give us a hand with this one.

744
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,928
- What's so special about this box?
- It's my lucky number.

745
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:42,470
All yours, me lovely.

746
00:49:42,570 --> 00:49:44,570
- There you are.
- Cheers.

747
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:08,961
Holy shit.
You know who that is?

748
00:50:09,062 --> 00:50:10,903
It's Princess Margaret.

749
00:50:11,003 --> 00:50:13,857
Terry, anything for the
widows and auctions funds?

750
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:18,586
- Will that do?
- God bless you, you're very generous.

751
00:50:18,686 --> 00:50:20,552
Look, we have to have
some sort of system.

752
00:50:20,653 --> 00:50:22,449
You don't know what you are throwing
or what you are keeping.

753
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:23,844
Yeah, but we know what money looks like.

754
00:50:23,945 --> 00:50:26,075
We're not throwing that away, are we?

755
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:36,896
How long does it take
to rob a bank?

756
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:41,204
<i>We're just about to get
this job done, okay?</i>

757
00:50:41,354 --> 00:50:42,116
More cash.

758
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:44,685
Have a look at this.

759
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:02,024
No, nothing.

760
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:03,172
Still nothing.

761
00:51:03,272 --> 00:51:04,551
Sergeant, what we need is something

762
00:51:04,651 --> 00:51:06,272
that will motivate the
robbers to go on air,

763
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:09,296
<i>- give away their location.</i>
- Right..

764
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:11,296
Bait to lure the fish.

765
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:17,154
No, they are not there,
not transmitting.

766
00:51:17,254 --> 00:51:18,616
They are not there, sir.

767
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:22,406
Move to the next bank,
unit #2.
