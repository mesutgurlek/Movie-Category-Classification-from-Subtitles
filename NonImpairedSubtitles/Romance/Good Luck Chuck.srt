1
00:00:53,652 --> 00:00:56,143
All right, Kent!

2
00:00:57,489 --> 00:00:58,547
Go, Hayley.

3
00:00:58,657 --> 00:00:59,624
Seven minutes.

4
00:00:59,725 --> 00:01:01,454
Go get 'em, cowboy.

5
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,585
See you in seven minutes.

6
00:01:07,299 --> 00:01:09,358
Stu, run it by me again.

7
00:01:09,468 --> 00:01:11,026
Kissing is first base.

8
00:01:11,136 --> 00:01:12,433
Second base is boob.

9
00:01:12,538 --> 00:01:14,096
- Third base is-
- Finger.

10
00:01:14,206 --> 00:01:16,640
- Finger?
- Or thumb.

11
00:01:16,742 --> 00:01:17,902
Okay.

12
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:20,342
Charlie, trust me.

13
00:01:20,445 --> 00:01:22,913
Second base is what
it's all about.

14
00:01:23,015 --> 00:01:24,539
I'm all about
the boobies.

15
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:26,618
Okay.
Anything else?

16
00:01:26,718 --> 00:01:29,380
An intentional walk
is a kiss on the cheek.

17
00:01:29,488 --> 00:01:31,718
An inside park home run
is a blow job.

18
00:01:31,823 --> 00:01:33,085
What's a blow job?

19
00:01:33,192 --> 00:01:34,750
I have no idea,

20
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,259
but I overheard
my dad saying

21
00:01:36,361 --> 00:01:38,192
that he gets one
once a year on his birthday.

22
00:01:38,297 --> 00:01:40,162
So it must be good.

23
00:01:52,978 --> 00:01:54,240
Yeah!

24
00:01:54,346 --> 00:01:56,143
You, me.

25
00:01:56,248 --> 00:01:57,408
Closet.

26
00:01:57,516 --> 00:01:58,710
Seven minutes.

27
00:01:58,817 --> 00:01:59,749
Heaven.

28
00:02:00,886 --> 00:02:02,217
He's so gross.

29
00:02:04,923 --> 00:02:06,117
Sorry, Jennifer.

30
00:02:14,366 --> 00:02:15,298
Stop.

31
00:02:15,734 --> 00:02:16,666
Don't touch me.

32
00:02:16,768 --> 00:02:18,326
Stand on that side
of the closet,

33
00:02:18,437 --> 00:02:19,597
and I'll say we kissed.

34
00:02:19,705 --> 00:02:22,697
I will... if you say
we did the nasty.

35
00:02:22,808 --> 00:02:25,572
No.
I'll say we kissed.

36
00:02:25,677 --> 00:02:27,804
Say I touched
your boobies.

37
00:02:27,913 --> 00:02:30,882
No!
I'll say we kissed.

38
00:02:30,983 --> 00:02:32,848
Okay.

39
00:02:32,951 --> 00:02:34,646
I kissed your boobies.

40
00:02:57,476 --> 00:02:59,000
Anisha!

41
00:03:06,118 --> 00:03:07,915
Stop staring.
You're freaking me out.

42
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:10,750
I'm looking at you
'cause I like you, Charlie.

43
00:03:10,856 --> 00:03:12,153
It's okay.

44
00:03:12,257 --> 00:03:13,849
Come on. You can
do what you want.

45
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:16,757
That's okay.
I'm kind of new at this.

46
00:03:16,862 --> 00:03:18,295
Let me see your penis.

47
00:03:19,665 --> 00:03:21,826
What's the matter?
Don't you want me?

48
00:03:23,001 --> 00:03:24,764
Oh, my God!

49
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:26,337
That's my boy.

50
00:03:26,872 --> 00:03:28,601
He's probably
blow-jobbing her.

51
00:03:33,979 --> 00:03:36,743
Anisha!
I can't breathe!

52
00:03:36,848 --> 00:03:37,906
I love you, Charlie.

53
00:03:38,016 --> 00:03:39,005
I've loved you
since the third grade.

54
00:03:39,117 --> 00:03:40,778
Um... thank you?

55
00:03:40,886 --> 00:03:42,547
So you like to play
hard to get.

56
00:03:42,654 --> 00:03:44,519
Back off!

57
00:03:44,623 --> 00:03:46,181
I've read
in my mom's Cosmo

58
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:48,589
this is supposed
to increase pleasure.

59
00:03:50,495 --> 00:03:52,690
Don't worry.
This is my first time, too.

60
00:03:52,798 --> 00:03:54,766
First time what, killing?

61
00:03:54,866 --> 00:03:56,231
No, Charlie.
Making love.

62
00:03:57,969 --> 00:03:59,903
Get off me, you freak!

63
00:04:05,143 --> 00:04:08,306
Charlie Logan, you are not
my boyfriend anymore.

64
00:04:08,413 --> 00:04:09,573
I hex you!

65
00:04:09,681 --> 00:04:10,841
You what?

66
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:14,282
I hex you.
You will never be happy.

67
00:04:15,587 --> 00:04:17,748
Around you love will fall
like rain.

68
00:04:17,856 --> 00:04:20,825
But you won't hold it.
Your heart will pain!

69
00:04:20,926 --> 00:04:22,757
Once the girl
has been with you,

70
00:04:22,861 --> 00:04:25,159
to the next she will be true!

71
00:04:26,865 --> 00:04:28,492
Was that Phil Collins?

72
00:04:35,941 --> 00:04:37,169
What happened?

73
00:04:37,542 --> 00:04:39,100
Did you thumb her?

74
00:04:52,891 --> 00:04:55,792
Charlie, we could get arrested
for public indecency.

75
00:04:55,894 --> 00:04:57,521
I like the way you think.

76
00:05:17,349 --> 00:05:19,715
Okay.

77
00:05:26,191 --> 00:05:27,954
All right!

78
00:05:28,059 --> 00:05:31,426
Oh, my-
Oh, my God, Carol.

79
00:05:33,098 --> 00:05:34,759
I love you.

80
00:05:36,268 --> 00:05:38,133
I love you!

81
00:05:38,236 --> 00:05:40,227
Thank you.

82
00:05:40,338 --> 00:05:41,930
I love you, Charlie.

83
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,029
Oh, that's nice.

84
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:46,841
"That's nice"?

85
00:05:46,945 --> 00:05:48,810
I'm licking the sand
off your balls,

86
00:05:48,914 --> 00:05:50,074
and you say,
"That's nice"?

87
00:05:50,182 --> 00:05:52,275
No, I said,
"Oh, my God" to that.

88
00:05:52,384 --> 00:05:55,717
I said, "Oh, my God"
very enthusiastically about the ball lick.

89
00:05:55,821 --> 00:05:58,289
Hey, listen, I'm sorry.

90
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:01,223
I just don't think the "L" word
should be thrown around casually.

91
00:06:02,527 --> 00:06:04,961
The "L" word?
What are you, eight?

92
00:06:05,063 --> 00:06:08,157
How about the "F" word
and the "you" word?

93
00:06:27,786 --> 00:06:29,947
I can't believe
you and Carol went belly-up, man.

94
00:06:30,055 --> 00:06:31,215
She was so into you.

95
00:06:31,323 --> 00:06:34,190
Yeah, well, she was
a, uh, noisy eater.

96
00:06:36,027 --> 00:06:38,359
It's that word, Stu: love.

97
00:06:38,463 --> 00:06:40,863
I wanted to say it,
but I just- I couldn't.

98
00:06:40,966 --> 00:06:43,366
How can I say something
if I don't feel it?

99
00:06:43,468 --> 00:06:45,333
Easy. Lie.

100
00:06:45,437 --> 00:06:47,837
What do you think
all relationships are based on, man?

101
00:06:47,939 --> 00:06:48,997
Lies.

102
00:06:49,107 --> 00:06:51,632
"No, honey, your ass
looks great in those jeans. "

103
00:06:51,743 --> 00:06:54,303
"Honey,
I love your parents. "

104
00:06:54,412 --> 00:06:56,812
"You're kidding me. That sore right there?
That's not herpes. "

105
00:06:56,915 --> 00:06:58,075
You know what I'm saying?

106
00:06:58,183 --> 00:07:00,344
So, then, who are you
taking to Katie's wedding?

107
00:07:00,452 --> 00:07:02,352
Oh, I don't know.
You want to go?

108
00:07:02,521 --> 00:07:04,011
Do bridesmaids give head
in the coat room?

109
00:07:04,122 --> 00:07:07,148
Of course I want to go!

110
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:09,921
You know how easy it is
to score at a wedding?

111
00:07:10,028 --> 00:07:12,428
Have you ever scored
at a wedding?

112
00:07:12,531 --> 00:07:14,362
Pacing myself.

113
00:07:14,466 --> 00:07:16,024
Must be weird.

114
00:07:16,134 --> 00:07:17,795
You were dating Katie
six months ago,

115
00:07:17,903 --> 00:07:19,302
and now she's
marrying a doctor.

116
00:07:19,404 --> 00:07:21,031
I'm a doctor.

117
00:07:21,139 --> 00:07:23,198
He's a heart surgeon.
You're a dentist.

118
00:07:23,308 --> 00:07:25,208
It's like saying
General Patton and Colonel Mustard

119
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:26,675
are both military men.

120
00:07:26,778 --> 00:07:28,678
Hi, Dr. Stu.

121
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:29,747
Natalie.

122
00:07:36,288 --> 00:07:37,915
I jerk off
to her mammograms.

123
00:07:39,324 --> 00:07:41,087
God, I love my job.

124
00:07:41,192 --> 00:07:42,659
Every day is like Christmas.

125
00:07:42,761 --> 00:07:44,490
Who are you
working over today?

126
00:07:48,867 --> 00:07:50,960
Dr. Charlie,
you're five minutes late!

127
00:07:51,069 --> 00:07:52,730
You've got four fillings,
three cleanings,

128
00:07:52,837 --> 00:07:54,202
two crowns, and a canal.

129
00:07:54,306 --> 00:07:55,705
You've got too many patients,

130
00:07:55,807 --> 00:07:57,570
and I've got too little patience

131
00:07:57,676 --> 00:07:59,075
for you to be gabbing gossip

132
00:07:59,177 --> 00:08:01,008
with Dr. Boob Jobs in the hallway.

133
00:08:01,112 --> 00:08:02,670
How are you today, Reba?

134
00:08:02,781 --> 00:08:04,646
Were you just
looking at my tits?

135
00:08:04,749 --> 00:08:06,216
Because I am more than happy

136
00:08:06,318 --> 00:08:07,979
with what the Lord Almighty gave me.

137
00:08:08,086 --> 00:08:09,678
I wasn't looking at your-

138
00:08:09,788 --> 00:08:12,256
Come on, Dr. Charlie.

139
00:08:21,433 --> 00:08:25,893
I don't want anybody else

140
00:08:26,004 --> 00:08:29,997
When I think about you,
I rub myself

141
00:08:30,108 --> 00:08:34,408
I don't want
anybody else

142
00:08:34,512 --> 00:08:38,539
When I think about you,
I touch myself

143
00:08:39,384 --> 00:08:40,976
You are what-

144
00:08:41,119 --> 00:08:42,279
Okay, you're my wingman.

145
00:08:42,387 --> 00:08:44,048
If the blonde asks,

146
00:08:44,155 --> 00:08:46,521
I'm the billionaire
who invented string cheese.

147
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:47,785
If it's that redhead,

148
00:08:47,892 --> 00:08:49,792
tell her I wrote
"We Are the World. "

149
00:08:49,894 --> 00:08:52,055
And, uh, if it's
that cheerleader hottie over there,

150
00:08:52,163 --> 00:08:54,324
my penis is in
the Guinness Book of World Records:

151
00:08:54,432 --> 00:08:55,660
girth, not length.

152
00:08:55,767 --> 00:08:57,166
I want it to sound believable.

153
00:08:57,268 --> 00:08:58,792
Holy shit.

154
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,837
Activate pelvis.

155
00:09:14,419 --> 00:09:17,388
Yo, yo, yo, hold on
to your pantyhose.

156
00:09:17,489 --> 00:09:20,083
The hostess
with the mostest

157
00:09:20,191 --> 00:09:21,658
has got a toastess.

158
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,664
I just want to thank everybody

159
00:09:30,769 --> 00:09:32,828
for coming to share
this day with us.

160
00:09:32,937 --> 00:09:34,871
I couldn't imagine
being any happier

161
00:09:34,973 --> 00:09:36,372
than I am right now.

162
00:09:36,474 --> 00:09:38,442
Wait till tonight, sweetheart.

163
00:09:39,878 --> 00:09:41,470
I know it's
a little unorthodox,

164
00:09:41,579 --> 00:09:44,480
but I'd also like
to propose a toast...

165
00:09:46,484 --> 00:09:48,042
to Charlie Logan.

166
00:09:48,153 --> 00:09:53,147
Thank you, Charlie,
for being my lucky charm.

167
00:09:53,258 --> 00:09:54,190
To Charlie!

168
00:09:54,292 --> 00:09:56,283
- To Charlie.
- To Charlie.

169
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:03,726
So, you're that Charlie?

170
00:10:03,835 --> 00:10:05,063
What Charlie?

171
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:08,503
You know, Charlie,
the- the dentist.

172
00:10:34,032 --> 00:10:36,091
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

173
00:10:36,201 --> 00:10:37,691
- Oh, no. Are you okay?
- That's horrible.

174
00:10:37,802 --> 00:10:39,895
- I'm all right.
- I didn't- I didn't mean to.

175
00:10:40,004 --> 00:10:42,234
Sorry about that.

176
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:43,602
Oh, jeez.

177
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:45,107
Here you go.

178
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:46,472
- Thanks.
- Sure.

179
00:10:46,578 --> 00:10:48,205
Oh. There I am.

180
00:10:49,748 --> 00:10:51,215
Join us.

181
00:10:52,917 --> 00:10:55,044
So, what did I miss?

182
00:10:55,153 --> 00:10:56,381
Not much.

183
00:10:56,488 --> 00:10:58,285
Same old-
I do, I do.

184
00:10:58,389 --> 00:10:59,651
"You may
kiss the bride. "

185
00:10:59,758 --> 00:11:01,692
White cake
with raspberry filling,

186
00:11:01,793 --> 00:11:03,488
and the doves
being released,

187
00:11:03,595 --> 00:11:06,155
but the doves
refuse to leave.

188
00:11:08,099 --> 00:11:10,727
I'm Cam. I went
to college with the bride.

189
00:11:10,835 --> 00:11:13,065
I'm Charlie.
I used to date the bride.

190
00:11:13,171 --> 00:11:14,195
Me, too.

191
00:11:15,874 --> 00:11:18,399
Well, no. I mean,
it was a one-time-only

192
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:19,909
experimental thing,
sophomore year.

193
00:11:20,011 --> 00:11:22,445
We were young.
And drunk.

194
00:11:28,887 --> 00:11:31,515
Is this person
being dipped in acid?

195
00:11:31,623 --> 00:11:35,320
Waiter, could we
have some chloroform for the singer?

196
00:11:35,426 --> 00:11:37,053
What are you going to sing?

197
00:11:37,162 --> 00:11:39,221
I'm thinking about
doing Bon Jovi "Livin' On a Prayer. "

198
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:40,820
Really?
That's the one I was going to do.

199
00:11:40,932 --> 00:11:42,263
- Oh, really?
- No.

200
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:47,570
So, Cam, what do you do?

201
00:11:47,672 --> 00:11:50,106
I run the Penguin Habitat
at Aqua World.

202
00:11:51,442 --> 00:11:52,966
Seriously, what do you do?

203
00:11:54,245 --> 00:11:55,269
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

204
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:56,312
I'm a serial killer.

205
00:11:56,414 --> 00:11:58,575
My passion is killing people
I meet at weddings.

206
00:11:58,683 --> 00:11:59,581
What do you do?

207
00:11:59,684 --> 00:12:02,175
FBl.
You're under arrest.

208
00:12:02,287 --> 00:12:04,221
Your run is over,
Miss "Wexler,"

209
00:12:04,322 --> 00:12:06,586
if that's your real name.

210
00:12:08,193 --> 00:12:10,127
Actually, I am a dentist.

211
00:12:10,228 --> 00:12:11,456
You're a dentist?

212
00:12:11,563 --> 00:12:13,895
You'll love me.
Perfect teeth. No cavities.

213
00:12:13,998 --> 00:12:15,295
Want to see?

214
00:12:16,401 --> 00:12:17,993
Oh, my! My legs!

215
00:12:18,102 --> 00:12:20,002
I'm sorry.

216
00:12:20,104 --> 00:12:21,196
Water!

217
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:23,900
Oh, no!

218
00:12:24,008 --> 00:12:25,202
I'm sorry.

219
00:12:26,311 --> 00:12:28,575
I'll just get in there and-

220
00:12:29,881 --> 00:12:30,973
- That's all right.
- I'm sorry.

221
00:12:31,082 --> 00:12:32,743
Wait.
Let me see, let me see.

222
00:12:32,851 --> 00:12:36,014
- Thanks.
- It looks like cum!

223
00:12:36,855 --> 00:12:38,288
Well, here I am.

224
00:12:38,389 --> 00:12:39,879
What are your other two wishes?

225
00:12:41,292 --> 00:12:43,624
Stu, Cam.
Cam, Stu.

226
00:12:43,728 --> 00:12:44,626
- Hi.
- Hi.

227
00:12:44,729 --> 00:12:47,163
It's actually Doctor Stu.

228
00:12:47,265 --> 00:12:48,698
I'm a reconstructive
surgeon.

229
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,496
If anyone has an accident
or is born with a deformity,

230
00:12:51,603 --> 00:12:53,036
I'm there to help.

231
00:12:53,137 --> 00:12:55,332
And by deformity,
he means small breasts.

232
00:12:56,908 --> 00:12:58,375
He's just jealous

233
00:12:58,476 --> 00:13:00,637
because he has to clean
plaque all day long

234
00:13:00,745 --> 00:13:02,542
while I'm out
making the world a better place.

235
00:13:03,915 --> 00:13:06,315
Cam, you will not
believe this doofus

236
00:13:06,417 --> 00:13:08,282
that just tried to pick me up.

237
00:13:08,386 --> 00:13:09,717
Oh. Hi.

238
00:13:09,821 --> 00:13:10,719
Hi.

239
00:13:10,822 --> 00:13:11,982
- Again.
- Yeah.

240
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:13,489
Yeah.

241
00:13:14,525 --> 00:13:15,753
I got to go.

242
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,418
Nice to meet you.

243
00:13:18,596 --> 00:13:19,756
Tits and teeth.

244
00:13:23,001 --> 00:13:25,868
I don't think
she was into me.

245
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:28,268
Say, uh, ladies-

246
00:13:30,308 --> 00:13:31,400
Hey, you.

247
00:13:31,509 --> 00:13:32,976
Hey.

248
00:13:33,077 --> 00:13:34,635
- You look great.
- Thank you.

249
00:13:34,746 --> 00:13:36,270
So do you.

250
00:13:36,381 --> 00:13:38,679
So, how are you and Carol doing?

251
00:13:39,884 --> 00:13:40,942
We're-

252
00:13:42,921 --> 00:13:46,755
We're just giving each other
a little space right now.

253
00:13:46,858 --> 00:13:49,122
I worry about you
sometimes, Chuck.

254
00:13:49,227 --> 00:13:51,855
Always a bridesmaid,
never a bride.

255
00:13:51,963 --> 00:13:53,624
It's better
to have loved and lost

256
00:13:53,731 --> 00:13:55,494
than to have never
loved at all.

257
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,764
I'll buy that when you can honestly
tell me that you have loved.

258
00:13:59,871 --> 00:14:01,065
<i>Touché.</i>

259
00:14:03,174 --> 00:14:05,142
I just want to see you
happy, Chuckles.

260
00:14:07,045 --> 00:14:09,570
Attention, hot mamas.

261
00:14:09,681 --> 00:14:11,376
Can we have all
the single ladies

262
00:14:11,482 --> 00:14:14,212
out on the terrace
for the tossing of the bride's bouquet?

263
00:14:14,319 --> 00:14:15,513
See you.

264
00:14:23,561 --> 00:14:24,619
Ready, ladies?

265
00:14:24,729 --> 00:14:27,357
One!

266
00:14:27,465 --> 00:14:29,660
Two!

267
00:14:29,767 --> 00:14:31,291
Three!

268
00:14:51,255 --> 00:14:52,153
Morning, Reba.

269
00:14:52,256 --> 00:14:53,814
Good morning, Dr. Logan.

270
00:14:55,426 --> 00:14:57,826
Good morning, Doctor.

271
00:14:57,929 --> 00:14:59,863
I think I have a cavity.

272
00:14:59,964 --> 00:15:01,363
Me, too.

273
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,325
- Hey, Sharon. Is Stu in?
- Hi.

274
00:15:38,436 --> 00:15:40,870
Sharon-
Oh, Dr. Logan.

275
00:15:40,972 --> 00:15:43,099
Can you come back here
for a second, please?

276
00:15:49,847 --> 00:15:51,109
Oh, I'm sorry.

277
00:15:51,215 --> 00:15:53,376
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
We need you.

278
00:15:53,484 --> 00:15:55,315
Dr. Logan-

279
00:15:56,988 --> 00:15:58,546
This is Pleasure.

280
00:15:58,656 --> 00:15:59,816
Nice to meet you.

281
00:15:59,924 --> 00:16:01,755
The pleasure's all mine.

282
00:16:01,859 --> 00:16:03,451
Get it?

283
00:16:03,561 --> 00:16:05,256
"The pleasure's all mine"?

284
00:16:05,363 --> 00:16:07,331
My name is Pleasure.

285
00:16:07,432 --> 00:16:12,096
That is... enormously clever.

286
00:16:13,538 --> 00:16:15,062
We need
a second opinion.

287
00:16:15,173 --> 00:16:17,471
What do you think?

288
00:16:17,575 --> 00:16:19,975
Are they even?

289
00:16:20,078 --> 00:16:21,170
So you knew they were even.

290
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:22,610
Of course they were even. I did them.

291
00:16:22,713 --> 00:16:24,010
I just wanted you to see them

292
00:16:24,115 --> 00:16:25,844
without having to pay
for a lap dance.

293
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:27,941
How did you get a license
to practice medicine?

294
00:16:28,052 --> 00:16:29,314
You need a license?

295
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:33,083
Listen, have you noticed
anything different about me?

296
00:16:33,191 --> 00:16:36,592
Other than your aversion
to fantastic, gigantic titties?

297
00:16:36,694 --> 00:16:39,424
Women seem to be
coming on to me

298
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:41,430
in an unusual manner.

299
00:16:41,532 --> 00:16:42,999
Really?

300
00:16:51,676 --> 00:16:53,644
That's crazy.

301
00:16:54,712 --> 00:16:56,839
Charlie! Stuart.

302
00:16:56,948 --> 00:16:58,142
Carol.

303
00:16:58,249 --> 00:17:00,615
Are these back
in season again?

304
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:03,819
You're getting married.

305
00:17:03,921 --> 00:17:06,253
What can I say?

306
00:17:06,357 --> 00:17:08,416
I guess you are
a lucky charm.

307
00:17:25,743 --> 00:17:27,768
You have 14 new messages.

308
00:17:27,879 --> 00:17:28,971
Message 1.

309
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:31,207
Hey, Charlie.
My name's Nicole Adams.

310
00:17:31,315 --> 00:17:32,441
You don't know me,

311
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:34,484
but I got your number
from Amy in Radiology.

312
00:17:34,585 --> 00:17:36,553
I was wondering
if we could meet up

313
00:17:36,654 --> 00:17:37,814
for drinks
one of these nights.

314
00:17:38,923 --> 00:17:40,515
Hi, Charlie.
My name's Julia.

315
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:43,355
I normally don't do this, but I'm desperate.
Could you-

316
00:17:43,461 --> 00:17:45,986
I'm not sure how you
choose your dates,

317
00:17:46,097 --> 00:17:47,428
but I'm 5'10", blonde-

318
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:50,065
Hello, Charlie.
My name is Daisy.

319
00:17:50,168 --> 00:17:51,635
Uh, actually in town-

320
00:17:52,737 --> 00:17:53,999
Hi. My name is Bob.

321
00:17:54,105 --> 00:17:56,005
No, it's not a wrong number.
Hear me out.

322
00:17:57,108 --> 00:17:58,040
Hi. This is Cindy.

323
00:17:58,142 --> 00:17:59,302
I'm a friend of Katie's-

324
00:18:00,411 --> 00:18:01,309
Hey, my name's Colleen-

325
00:18:02,413 --> 00:18:03,846
Hey, there.
We met at the gym.

326
00:18:03,948 --> 00:18:04,937
StairMaster buddies?

327
00:18:09,754 --> 00:18:11,619
Eat up, Shadow.

328
00:18:11,722 --> 00:18:14,350
Last chance before bedtime.

329
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:16,483
Good boy.

330
00:18:16,594 --> 00:18:19,085
Grumpy, don't be a pig.

331
00:18:19,197 --> 00:18:22,564
Don't be a pig.
That's Chester's.

332
00:18:22,667 --> 00:18:24,032
There you go.

333
00:18:24,135 --> 00:18:26,433
Good boy.

334
00:18:26,537 --> 00:18:28,801
Here, Dougie.
Gobble it up.

335
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:31,800
Come here, Tina.

336
00:18:31,909 --> 00:18:34,241
Grumpy,
you're such a pig.

337
00:18:35,546 --> 00:18:37,343
Joe, hurry up!

338
00:18:37,448 --> 00:18:39,040
I want to go home.

339
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:44,549
Did you get lost
back there?

340
00:18:44,655 --> 00:18:45,747
Sorry.

341
00:18:45,856 --> 00:18:47,187
Just taking five...

342
00:18:48,025 --> 00:18:50,220
hits from my bong.

343
00:18:50,328 --> 00:18:52,796
If they catch you with weed,
you're going to get fired.

344
00:18:52,897 --> 00:18:54,387
They don't care
that you're my brother.

345
00:18:54,498 --> 00:18:55,897
Oh, take a chillaxitive.

346
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,525
How is anybody
going to know?

347
00:18:58,636 --> 00:19:01,298
Maybe 'cause you smell like you've been
bathing in bong water.

348
00:19:02,406 --> 00:19:03,964
Sweet.

349
00:19:04,075 --> 00:19:05,167
What's that in your pocket?

350
00:19:08,946 --> 00:19:11,107
Oh, I was looking for this.

351
00:19:11,215 --> 00:19:12,682
Three months.

352
00:19:12,783 --> 00:19:14,546
Hey, Skully.

353
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:22,449
Joe!
Joe, I'm slipping!

354
00:19:29,033 --> 00:19:31,160
And you think I look wasted.

355
00:19:36,607 --> 00:19:38,939
Grumpy, no!

356
00:19:50,554 --> 00:19:51,521
You okay?

357
00:19:53,357 --> 00:19:55,154
I think I chipped a tooth.

358
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,918
It's great to finally meet you.

359
00:19:58,029 --> 00:19:59,053
Let me get that for you.

360
00:19:59,163 --> 00:20:00,630
- Oh, thank you.
- Sure.

361
00:20:03,067 --> 00:20:04,500
- All right?
- Yeah.

362
00:20:10,241 --> 00:20:11,401
All right.

363
00:20:11,509 --> 00:20:12,407
Are you ready?

364
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:13,943
Yeah, let's go.

365
00:20:19,617 --> 00:20:20,914
Don't you want to, uh-

366
00:20:21,018 --> 00:20:22,144
What?

367
00:20:24,388 --> 00:20:25,650
I don't know,
have dinner first?

368
00:20:25,756 --> 00:20:27,587
Is that how this works?

369
00:20:27,692 --> 00:20:29,819
How what works?

370
00:20:29,927 --> 00:20:30,894
The thing.

371
00:20:30,995 --> 00:20:32,587
The thing. The magic.

372
00:20:32,697 --> 00:20:33,823
The charm.

373
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,328
Wait a second.

374
00:20:39,003 --> 00:20:40,994
Gretel, what the hell
are you talking about?

375
00:20:41,105 --> 00:20:43,266
You're a lucky charm.
You have sex with someone,

376
00:20:43,374 --> 00:20:45,137
and then they find
their true love.

377
00:20:45,242 --> 00:20:46,402
Isn't that how it works?

378
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:47,670
Has everybody
lost their minds?

379
00:20:47,778 --> 00:20:48,802
That's ridiculous.
That's absurd.

380
00:20:48,913 --> 00:20:51,347
Do you want top
or bottom?

381
00:20:51,449 --> 00:20:53,349
Put that back
in your secret booby place.

382
00:20:53,451 --> 00:20:55,476
That's- No.

383
00:20:55,586 --> 00:20:57,679
I don't want to take
advantage of you.

384
00:21:00,891 --> 00:21:03,655
Look, don't take this
so seriously.

385
00:21:03,761 --> 00:21:04,887
I'm certainly not.

386
00:21:04,995 --> 00:21:06,690
I'm doing this on a lark.

387
00:21:06,797 --> 00:21:09,265
And you won't be
taking advantage of me.

388
00:21:09,367 --> 00:21:12,336
Do you know how many
loser boyfriends I have had?

389
00:21:12,436 --> 00:21:15,030
Do you know how many times
I have given myself-

390
00:21:15,139 --> 00:21:16,697
body, mind, soul-

391
00:21:16,807 --> 00:21:18,968
hoping that this was it,
this was the one,

392
00:21:19,076 --> 00:21:23,638
only to find out he was
just another asshole?

393
00:21:23,748 --> 00:21:25,579
Look, if there's a chance-

394
00:21:25,683 --> 00:21:30,677
I mean even a. 0001 %%% chance
that you're the key,

395
00:21:30,788 --> 00:21:34,554
that being with you could
open the door to something better,

396
00:21:34,658 --> 00:21:39,527
well, I think I'd be
taking advantage of you.

397
00:21:42,266 --> 00:21:44,666
Do you want to have sex
before or after dinner?

398
00:21:44,769 --> 00:21:47,203
Actually, I have dinner plans.

399
00:21:48,939 --> 00:21:51,840
I got to get that.
It's my emergency line.

400
00:21:51,942 --> 00:21:53,842
Oh. Emergency.
Now, that's sexy.

401
00:21:53,944 --> 00:21:55,070
Dr. Logan speaking.

402
00:21:55,179 --> 00:21:57,238
Hey, it's Cam Wexler.

403
00:21:57,348 --> 00:21:59,316
Remember,
from the wedding?

404
00:21:59,417 --> 00:22:01,351
The serial killer?

405
00:22:05,423 --> 00:22:06,913
Yeah. Yeah, hi.

406
00:22:07,024 --> 00:22:08,252
I'm sorry to bother you,

407
00:22:08,359 --> 00:22:10,919
but I have a bit
of a dental emergency.

408
00:22:11,028 --> 00:22:12,928
You don't have to make up stories, Cam.

409
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:16,193
If you want to see me,
all you have to do is ask.

410
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,927
No, seriously.
I chipped a tooth,

411
00:22:18,035 --> 00:22:19,024
and it's Saturday night,

412
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:21,434
and I don't know
who else to call.

413
00:22:21,539 --> 00:22:23,063
Oh, you chipped a tooth?
How?

414
00:22:23,174 --> 00:22:25,142
I slipped while having
a fish fight,

415
00:22:25,242 --> 00:22:26,436
slid down an ice ramp,

416
00:22:26,544 --> 00:22:27,806
got tackled by a penguin,

417
00:22:27,912 --> 00:22:30,210
and fell face-first
into a fake ice boulder.

418
00:22:30,314 --> 00:22:32,373
This is very common.

419
00:22:32,483 --> 00:22:34,144
Do you know
where my office is?

420
00:22:34,251 --> 00:22:36,549
Yeah. I got your card
right here.

421
00:22:36,654 --> 00:22:38,383
I can be there
in 20 minutes?

422
00:22:38,489 --> 00:22:40,514
20 minutes.
I'm leaving now.

423
00:22:40,624 --> 00:22:41,921
Okay.

424
00:22:54,972 --> 00:22:56,769
Okay, all fixed.

425
00:22:56,874 --> 00:22:58,239
Does that hurt?

426
00:22:59,577 --> 00:23:01,841
Can you describe the penguin
that attacked you?

427
00:23:01,946 --> 00:23:03,208
Very funny.

428
00:23:03,314 --> 00:23:04,474
You can rinse.

429
00:23:07,551 --> 00:23:09,143
So what really happened?

430
00:23:09,253 --> 00:23:10,777
Did you get caught
in the middle

431
00:23:10,888 --> 00:23:12,617
of some North Pole-
South Pole gang war?

432
00:23:12,723 --> 00:23:14,850
There are no penguins
in the North Pole.

433
00:23:14,959 --> 00:23:16,187
That's polar bears.

434
00:23:16,293 --> 00:23:18,386
You really are
a penguin freak, aren't you?

435
00:23:18,496 --> 00:23:20,020
Oh, you have no idea.

436
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:22,189
Obsessed is putting it mildly.

437
00:23:22,299 --> 00:23:24,199
I believe you.

438
00:23:24,301 --> 00:23:26,030
Oh, what's that?

439
00:23:26,136 --> 00:23:29,503
Oh, I travel
to Guatemala every year

440
00:23:29,607 --> 00:23:31,370
to help some
of the poorer villagers.

441
00:23:32,443 --> 00:23:34,536
That's so sweet.

442
00:23:37,581 --> 00:23:38,548
Sorry!

443
00:23:38,649 --> 00:23:40,276
Oh! Oh, no!
They went in!

444
00:23:40,384 --> 00:23:41,282
They're in there!

445
00:23:41,385 --> 00:23:42,647
- What's in there?
- The things!

446
00:23:42,753 --> 00:23:44,277
Oh, here.

447
00:23:45,055 --> 00:23:46,682
Oh, I'm sorry.

448
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:49,190
This is bad.

449
00:23:49,293 --> 00:23:50,351
- You're hurt.
- It's okay.

450
00:23:50,461 --> 00:23:51,723
I'm so sorry.

451
00:23:51,829 --> 00:23:53,228
Should have worn
that lead vest.

452
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:56,424
Oh, this always
happens to me.

453
00:23:56,534 --> 00:23:57,728
Are you okay?

454
00:23:57,835 --> 00:23:58,995
Yes.
Yeah, I'm fine.

455
00:23:59,103 --> 00:24:00,434
- You sure?
- I feel good.

456
00:24:00,538 --> 00:24:04,304
Man. I hope you let me
buy you a new shirt.

457
00:24:04,408 --> 00:24:07,138
No. No, really.
It's, uh, it's good.

458
00:24:07,244 --> 00:24:09,906
But I hope you'll let me
take you out to dinner...

459
00:24:10,648 --> 00:24:12,013
sometime.

460
00:24:12,116 --> 00:24:14,380
Trust me, you can do
far more damage with a steak knife.

461
00:24:14,485 --> 00:24:17,613
I'm sorry.
I- I can't.

462
00:24:17,721 --> 00:24:19,882
How much do I owe you
for the tooth?

463
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:22,151
Wait a second.
So you will draw first blood,

464
00:24:22,259 --> 00:24:25,160
but you won't
make it up to me?

465
00:24:25,262 --> 00:24:27,856
Please, how much?

466
00:24:27,965 --> 00:24:28,954
No.

467
00:24:29,066 --> 00:24:30,590
Your money's no good here.

468
00:24:31,468 --> 00:24:32,628
You sure?

469
00:24:32,903 --> 00:24:34,063
I will not accept that.

470
00:24:34,171 --> 00:24:36,196
Really?

471
00:24:36,307 --> 00:24:37,205
Thank you.

472
00:24:37,308 --> 00:24:38,297
Yes.

473
00:24:39,443 --> 00:24:40,910
- I'm sorry.
- No.

474
00:24:42,646 --> 00:24:45,046
See you in six months
for a routine stabbing.

475
00:24:46,183 --> 00:24:47,707
- Bye.
- Bye.

476
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,629
Change your mind?

477
00:25:04,735 --> 00:25:06,202
My car won't start.

478
00:25:07,137 --> 00:25:08,229
Sure it won't.

479
00:25:08,339 --> 00:25:10,068
No, really.
I left my lights on.

480
00:25:13,377 --> 00:25:14,537
Fine.
I'm pushing the car.

481
00:25:14,645 --> 00:25:16,875
No, no, no, wait.
I want to jump you.

482
00:25:25,122 --> 00:25:26,020
Now?

483
00:25:26,123 --> 00:25:28,785
Not now.
Wait till I get this in here.

484
00:25:28,892 --> 00:25:29,984
Now?

485
00:25:33,631 --> 00:25:34,791
Oh!

486
00:25:36,734 --> 00:25:37,928
You okay?

487
00:25:38,035 --> 00:25:39,093
Yep.

488
00:25:39,203 --> 00:25:40,101
Let's-

489
00:25:40,204 --> 00:25:41,330
I'm so sorry.

490
00:25:41,438 --> 00:25:42,962
No, no. It's fine.
It's good.

491
00:25:43,073 --> 00:25:44,768
Cauterized my wounds.

492
00:25:47,378 --> 00:25:48,345
Thank you.

493
00:25:48,445 --> 00:25:51,107
Thank you for fixing my tooth

494
00:25:51,215 --> 00:25:52,409
and jumping my car.

495
00:25:52,516 --> 00:25:53,847
Don't mention it.

496
00:25:58,956 --> 00:26:01,117
And thank you
for taking me home

497
00:26:01,225 --> 00:26:03,216
to get my spare
set of keys.

498
00:26:09,199 --> 00:26:12,532
I have a feeling
this kind of thing happens to you often.

499
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:15,267
My brother
calls me Murphy.

500
00:26:15,372 --> 00:26:16,270
Murphy?

501
00:26:16,373 --> 00:26:18,238
You know,
like, Murphy's Law:

502
00:26:18,342 --> 00:26:20,139
anything that can
go wrong, will.

503
00:26:20,244 --> 00:26:21,506
Details.

504
00:26:21,612 --> 00:26:23,307
Check out the thumb.

505
00:26:24,682 --> 00:26:25,740
Holy crap!

506
00:26:25,849 --> 00:26:27,874
What, did you get
pissed off at a stamp?

507
00:26:29,086 --> 00:26:30,951
How many bones
have you broken?

508
00:26:31,055 --> 00:26:33,353
- 12.
- 12 bones?

509
00:26:33,457 --> 00:26:36,051
I'm warning you,
keep a safe distance.

510
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,720
Come on. I can't believe
it's really that bad.

511
00:26:39,863 --> 00:26:40,887
Is this the heat?

512
00:26:40,998 --> 00:26:41,965
No!

513
00:26:45,703 --> 00:26:47,227
Convertible top.

514
00:26:47,337 --> 00:26:49,396
Oops.

515
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:54,436
Keep the meter running.

516
00:26:54,545 --> 00:26:55,443
All right.

517
00:26:55,546 --> 00:26:56,945
Oh, shit!

518
00:26:57,047 --> 00:26:59,572
Shit! Shit! Shit!

519
00:26:59,683 --> 00:27:01,014
Pardon my French.

520
00:27:01,118 --> 00:27:04,315
I speak a little French,
and that sounded like "shit. "

521
00:27:04,421 --> 00:27:06,582
I left my house key
on the car ring-

522
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:07,952
You know what?
Doesn't matter.

523
00:27:25,776 --> 00:27:26,765
Got it!

524
00:27:34,852 --> 00:27:35,841
- Sorry.
- You all right?

525
00:27:35,953 --> 00:27:37,420
Yeah.

526
00:27:37,521 --> 00:27:39,386
- Hope these are the right keys.
- Yeah.

527
00:27:53,403 --> 00:27:54,563
Thank you.

528
00:27:54,671 --> 00:27:56,730
I'm sorry about the top,

529
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:59,240
and the, uh,
nerve damage in the back,

530
00:27:59,343 --> 00:28:02,335
and the whole
electrocution thing, and-

531
00:28:02,446 --> 00:28:05,176
I'd still like
to pay for the tooth.

532
00:28:05,282 --> 00:28:07,443
I told you.
Buy me dinner.

533
00:28:08,952 --> 00:28:10,317
Lunch.

534
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:12,081
Vending machine.

535
00:28:12,189 --> 00:28:15,090
Drinks. Water.
I'm easy.

536
00:28:22,766 --> 00:28:24,063
I'm just...

537
00:28:24,168 --> 00:28:26,762
not emotionally available
at this time.

538
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:28,337
I'm okay with that.

539
00:28:28,438 --> 00:28:30,770
I'm looking for more of
a physical relationship anyway.

540
00:28:31,842 --> 00:28:33,104
So I've heard.

541
00:28:34,211 --> 00:28:35,439
I was kidding.

542
00:28:35,546 --> 00:28:38,174
That was a joke.
That was a stupid joke.

543
00:28:38,282 --> 00:28:41,683
Okay. I- I get it.

544
00:28:41,785 --> 00:28:43,047
So no way, then.

545
00:28:45,088 --> 00:28:46,453
I'm sorry.

546
00:28:49,026 --> 00:28:50,516
Good night, Dr. Logan.

547
00:28:59,236 --> 00:29:00,168
Thank you.

548
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:02,431
I, uh...

549
00:29:02,539 --> 00:29:04,404
Yeah.

550
00:29:45,883 --> 00:29:46,975
Hi, Dr. Charlie.

551
00:29:47,084 --> 00:29:49,211
Reba! What the hell
are you doing here?

552
00:29:49,319 --> 00:29:50,581
Sorry. I didn't mean
to scare you.

553
00:29:50,687 --> 00:29:53,087
I used the key you left me
in case of emergencies.

554
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:55,317
What's the emergency?

555
00:29:55,425 --> 00:29:58,053
I know about the charm.

556
00:29:59,096 --> 00:30:00,063
Not you, too.

557
00:30:00,163 --> 00:30:01,323
Somebody
posted about you

558
00:30:01,431 --> 00:30:03,023
on perfectmatch. com

559
00:30:03,133 --> 00:30:04,760
It's an internet
dating site.

560
00:30:04,868 --> 00:30:06,267
Yeah, I know what it is.

561
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:07,530
This is out of control.

562
00:30:07,638 --> 00:30:09,071
These stories
are just coincidence.

563
00:30:09,172 --> 00:30:10,503
That's what I thought.

564
00:30:10,607 --> 00:30:13,440
But then I went
to urbanlegends. com,

565
00:30:13,543 --> 00:30:14,874
and nobody's disproved it.

566
00:30:14,978 --> 00:30:17,776
Reba, I'll see you at work on Monday.
Good night.

567
00:30:17,881 --> 00:30:19,678
Dr. Logan, you've always
been there for me.

568
00:30:19,783 --> 00:30:21,444
When you need a day off, yes.

569
00:30:21,551 --> 00:30:23,212
When you need a lift home, yes.

570
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,220
When Reggie died
four years ago,

571
00:30:25,322 --> 00:30:26,983
you sent that beautiful card.

572
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:28,489
Do you remember
what you wrote?

573
00:30:28,592 --> 00:30:31,993
"If there's anything I can do,
please let me know. "

574
00:30:32,095 --> 00:30:32,993
Yeah, but, uh-

575
00:30:33,096 --> 00:30:35,564
Well, I'm letting
you know.

576
00:30:37,601 --> 00:30:39,034
That's not
what I had in mind.

577
00:30:39,136 --> 00:30:40,433
These panties are edible,

578
00:30:40,537 --> 00:30:42,129
but I'd avoid the tush area

579
00:30:42,239 --> 00:30:44,673
as I've been sitting
for about three hours.

580
00:30:44,775 --> 00:30:46,436
Reba, I'm not the guy for you.

581
00:30:46,543 --> 00:30:47,771
I'm not saying you are.

582
00:30:47,878 --> 00:30:50,142
But the next guy might be.

583
00:30:50,247 --> 00:30:51,771
Dr. Charlie, if we're together,

584
00:30:51,882 --> 00:30:53,543
I know I'll find my soul mate.

585
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:55,447
That- That's ridiculous.

586
00:30:57,821 --> 00:30:59,049
No.

587
00:30:59,156 --> 00:31:00,919
No, Reba. Don't cry.
It's okay.

588
00:31:02,592 --> 00:31:03,650
Come on, Dr. Charlie.

589
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,728
You got to do this for me.
Please.

590
00:31:05,829 --> 00:31:06,727
- Reba!
- Charlie-

591
00:31:10,634 --> 00:31:12,226
I can't do this.

592
00:31:12,336 --> 00:31:13,894
Don't worry.

593
00:31:14,004 --> 00:31:15,904
I'll do everything.

594
00:31:16,006 --> 00:31:17,132
Please.

595
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:19,800
Just close your eyes

596
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:23,277
and imagine somebody beautiful.

597
00:31:34,658 --> 00:31:36,956
I'll imagine you.

598
00:31:38,261 --> 00:31:40,695
No one but you.

599
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,398
Reba?

600
00:31:44,501 --> 00:31:46,093
You slept with Reba?

601
00:31:46,203 --> 00:31:47,500
Shut up.

602
00:31:47,604 --> 00:31:48,502
You shut up.

603
00:31:48,605 --> 00:31:50,300
What the hell's
the matter with you?

604
00:31:50,407 --> 00:31:52,307
You're telling me
that you have the power

605
00:31:52,409 --> 00:31:54,070
to turn any hot chick
out there-

606
00:31:54,177 --> 00:31:55,439
any hot chick-

607
00:31:55,545 --> 00:31:59,311
into a knob-gobbling,
lance-waxing flesh monger,

608
00:31:59,416 --> 00:32:02,146
and you're out there
plowing the back 40 with Reba!

609
00:32:02,252 --> 00:32:04,720
You don't know
because you weren't there.

610
00:32:04,821 --> 00:32:06,288
Thank God I wasn't there.

611
00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:08,483
It's disgusting.
It's revolting.

612
00:32:08,592 --> 00:32:09,718
You're nasty.

613
00:32:09,826 --> 00:32:10,884
How was she?

614
00:32:12,829 --> 00:32:14,319
Dude, check it.

615
00:32:14,431 --> 00:32:17,161
You see, that is
the kind of tail you should be chasing.

616
00:32:17,267 --> 00:32:19,360
I could suck a fart
out of her ass

617
00:32:19,469 --> 00:32:20,697
and hold it
like a bong hit.

618
00:32:25,909 --> 00:32:28,343
Nice stop, kid.
Way to be.

619
00:32:30,313 --> 00:32:31,746
Dude, these chicks,

620
00:32:31,848 --> 00:32:34,009
they think that you're,
like, a lucky charm, man.

621
00:32:34,117 --> 00:32:35,516
I mean,
you poke the poon,

622
00:32:35,619 --> 00:32:38,213
she marries the next guy
she dates after you.

623
00:32:38,321 --> 00:32:39,583
It's not true.

624
00:32:39,689 --> 00:32:40,883
Who cares if it's true?

625
00:32:40,991 --> 00:32:42,549
Wake up, man.

626
00:32:42,659 --> 00:32:44,251
You got it made.

627
00:32:44,361 --> 00:32:46,591
What is it
that all women want?

628
00:32:46,696 --> 00:32:49,164
To get married,

629
00:32:49,266 --> 00:32:51,291
raise crib midgets,

630
00:32:51,401 --> 00:32:52,993
and apparently, buddy,

631
00:32:53,103 --> 00:32:55,469
you got the ticket
to the big show.

632
00:32:55,572 --> 00:32:57,096
Do you know
what this means?

633
00:32:57,207 --> 00:32:58,640
Trim.

634
00:32:58,742 --> 00:33:01,540
You're going to be seeing
trim like Tommy Lee,

635
00:33:01,645 --> 00:33:03,044
like Colin Farrell,

636
00:33:03,146 --> 00:33:05,239
like Ellen DeGeneres-
just-

637
00:33:08,185 --> 00:33:10,210
Have you considered
the possibility the reason

638
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,844
you haven't been laid
in the last decade

639
00:33:11,955 --> 00:33:14,515
has something to do with
your routine use of the word "trim"?

640
00:33:14,624 --> 00:33:15,716
Yeah!

641
00:33:15,826 --> 00:33:18,590
Seven days a week, 56 weeks a year, trim!

642
00:33:21,531 --> 00:33:22,657
That's my bad.

643
00:33:22,766 --> 00:33:25,098
Where's your manners, shithead?

644
00:33:25,202 --> 00:33:26,669
What did you say to me?

645
00:33:28,738 --> 00:33:29,830
Little help here, honey?

646
00:33:34,244 --> 00:33:36,144
Look, you and I are different, okay?

647
00:33:36,246 --> 00:33:38,146
Besides the fact
that I'm not retarded,

648
00:33:38,248 --> 00:33:40,011
I don't want
to take advantage.

649
00:33:40,117 --> 00:33:41,277
- Dude.
- Yeah.

650
00:33:41,384 --> 00:33:43,852
Was Martin Luther King,
Jr. taking advantage

651
00:33:43,954 --> 00:33:46,149
when he said that thing
in that place?

652
00:33:46,256 --> 00:33:47,814
I don't think so.

653
00:33:47,924 --> 00:33:51,951
Was Gandhi taking advantage
when he was doing his thing?

654
00:33:52,062 --> 00:33:53,359
No.

655
00:33:53,463 --> 00:33:55,363
And don't tell me
that Gandhi didn't score

656
00:33:55,465 --> 00:33:57,330
some sweet-ass
Native American trim.

657
00:33:57,434 --> 00:33:59,163
Gandhi was Indian.

658
00:33:59,269 --> 00:34:01,260
They don't like
to be called that.

659
00:34:01,371 --> 00:34:04,306
Dude, I thought
you wanted to feel love.

660
00:34:04,407 --> 00:34:05,465
I do.

661
00:34:05,575 --> 00:34:09,272
So stop dipping your foot in the pool
and dive the fuck in!

662
00:34:09,379 --> 00:34:11,210
And think about this, man.

663
00:34:11,314 --> 00:34:13,578
You'd be providing
a much-needed public service.

664
00:34:13,683 --> 00:34:16,811
You'd be helping women find love.

665
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,251
Now, don't come bitching to me

666
00:34:18,355 --> 00:34:19,754
you haven't found Miss Right yet

667
00:34:19,856 --> 00:34:22,017
if you got women lining up
for the position

668
00:34:22,125 --> 00:34:24,389
and you're turning
your back on them.

669
00:34:27,898 --> 00:34:28,922
Nice.

670
00:34:30,901 --> 00:34:32,698
I guess.

671
00:34:32,802 --> 00:34:34,702
If I did it for the right reasons.

672
00:34:34,804 --> 00:34:38,399
Whatever helps you
sleep at night, biznatch.

673
00:35:11,041 --> 00:35:12,941
No, no, no. Whoa, whoa.
Don't take off my top.

674
00:35:13,043 --> 00:35:15,068
Something wrong?

675
00:35:15,178 --> 00:35:16,907
They're for the baby.

676
00:35:17,013 --> 00:35:18,708
You have a baby?

677
00:35:18,815 --> 00:35:21,648
No, but I will someday.

678
00:35:27,757 --> 00:35:29,156
It's really good.

679
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:31,227
Fuck me.

680
00:35:34,297 --> 00:35:35,264
Fuck me harder.

681
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:39,234
Oh.
Yeah.

682
00:35:39,336 --> 00:35:40,701
Fuck me!

683
00:35:40,804 --> 00:35:42,601
- Fuck me!
- I'm fucking!

684
00:35:42,706 --> 00:35:45,436
Fuck me, you cocksucking,
cum-guzzling shithead!

685
00:35:45,542 --> 00:35:46,702
Split my pussy in two!

686
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:49,005
You motherfucking asshole!

687
00:35:53,116 --> 00:35:54,413
Is something wrong?

688
00:36:31,588 --> 00:36:32,987
Oh, God.

689
00:36:33,089 --> 00:36:35,080
Oh, God!

690
00:36:35,792 --> 00:36:40,286
Oh, God!
Oh, Jesus Christ, almighty!

691
00:36:40,397 --> 00:36:42,797
God, my savior!

692
00:36:42,899 --> 00:36:47,199
I shall adore thee from now
until forever more!

693
00:36:47,304 --> 00:36:49,670
Oh! Amen!

694
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:53,240
Would you like to
pray with me now?

695
00:36:54,411 --> 00:36:56,436
Uh... no.

696
00:37:20,236 --> 00:37:21,863
Yeah, I don't do that with men.

697
00:37:31,381 --> 00:37:32,746
Oh, yeah.
That's it.

698
00:37:32,849 --> 00:37:34,646
That's it!

699
00:37:34,751 --> 00:37:36,719
That's definitely it!

700
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:38,481
That'll be my wedding dress.

701
00:37:38,588 --> 00:37:40,180
What do you think?

702
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:59,474
Megan, I swear I know you
from some place.

703
00:37:59,576 --> 00:38:03,239
We went to high school together.

704
00:38:03,346 --> 00:38:05,007
Megan...

705
00:38:05,115 --> 00:38:06,810
What's your last name?

706
00:38:06,916 --> 00:38:08,042
Gilles.

707
00:38:08,151 --> 00:38:11,382
Gilles.
I knew a Matthew Gilles.

708
00:38:11,488 --> 00:38:13,888
God, you do look like him.
Is that your brother?

709
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:16,857
Actually, that was me
before the operation.

710
00:38:32,909 --> 00:38:34,206
Thanks.

711
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,342
You're welcome.

712
00:38:41,518 --> 00:38:43,782
- This just isn't working for me.
- Yeah, right.

713
00:38:43,987 --> 00:38:45,750
You're just gonna give up
boning all these women?

714
00:38:45,855 --> 00:38:47,880
These girls don't want
to be with me.

715
00:38:47,991 --> 00:38:49,788
They want to be
with the next guy.

716
00:38:49,893 --> 00:38:53,124
So what? The road
to the next guy leads through you.

717
00:38:53,229 --> 00:38:55,891
It's not that satisfying.

718
00:38:55,999 --> 00:38:57,796
I'll tell you not satisfying.

719
00:38:57,901 --> 00:39:00,631
Last night I masturbated
into a grapefruit.

720
00:39:02,672 --> 00:39:03,866
I put it in the microwave.

721
00:39:03,973 --> 00:39:05,668
I heated it up
a little bit, which helped,

722
00:39:05,775 --> 00:39:06,673
but...

723
00:39:06,776 --> 00:39:09,244
still.

724
00:39:16,252 --> 00:39:20,154
You know, I read somewhere
that penguins like to eat their own shit.

725
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,366
You have 108 messages.

726
00:39:34,471 --> 00:39:36,371
Messages deleted.

727
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:53,120
The female lays a single egg

728
00:39:53,223 --> 00:39:55,054
and rolls it onto
the feet of the male.

729
00:39:55,158 --> 00:39:57,820
The male stands
and incubates the egg

730
00:39:57,927 --> 00:40:00,896
until it hatches,
about 65 days.

731
00:40:00,997 --> 00:40:03,397
Having built up
a thick layer of fat

732
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:05,434
to sustain him
through the long winter,

733
00:40:05,535 --> 00:40:08,197
he never leaves the egg
to hunt for food.

734
00:40:08,304 --> 00:40:11,967
The female returns just
before the chick hatches.

735
00:40:15,144 --> 00:40:17,840
If you have any questions,
please feel free to ask.

736
00:40:25,488 --> 00:40:26,546
What are you doing here?

737
00:40:26,656 --> 00:40:28,487
Are you telling me
that the male penguin

738
00:40:28,591 --> 00:40:30,559
really lives off
his own fat for 65 days

739
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:32,252
while he's protecting
the egg?

740
00:40:32,362 --> 00:40:34,387
You think that the female could bring him,
like, a mackerel burger?

741
00:40:34,497 --> 00:40:38,126
Seriously, why are you here?

742
00:40:38,234 --> 00:40:39,633
Look, I don't buy the whole

743
00:40:39,736 --> 00:40:41,931
"I'm not emotionally available" thing.

744
00:40:42,038 --> 00:40:43,096
Are you dying?

745
00:40:43,206 --> 00:40:44,605
Is that why you don't want
to get involved with me?

746
00:40:44,707 --> 00:40:46,572
Because you don't wanna
hurt me when you die?

747
00:40:46,676 --> 00:40:47,734
No, I'm not dying.

748
00:40:47,844 --> 00:40:50,540
Well, I'm not dying either,
so what is it, then?

749
00:40:50,647 --> 00:40:52,672
Am I not your type?
I can take it if it's that.

750
00:40:52,782 --> 00:40:55,410
I think you should go.

751
00:40:55,518 --> 00:40:56,780
No, I think
I should stay,

752
00:40:56,886 --> 00:40:59,650
because I paid $38.00
to see you today.

753
00:40:59,756 --> 00:41:01,815
And I'm not leaving
until you pay me my money back.

754
00:41:01,925 --> 00:41:03,256
Is this the dude?

755
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:05,190
- No. Joe!
- Have you been talking about me?

756
00:41:05,295 --> 00:41:06,785
Why aren't you wearing your shirt?

757
00:41:06,896 --> 00:41:08,295
- Has she been talking about me?
- Yeah.

758
00:41:08,398 --> 00:41:09,592
- No!
- You're the dentist.

759
00:41:09,699 --> 00:41:11,599
I am the dude!

760
00:41:11,701 --> 00:41:13,965
No, I mentioned you in passing.

761
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:15,537
I said you were funny.

762
00:41:15,638 --> 00:41:17,265
- Oh.
- And you said he was-

763
00:41:17,373 --> 00:41:20,365
And I said you were
charming and...

764
00:41:20,476 --> 00:41:22,205
good-looking, and...

765
00:41:22,312 --> 00:41:23,301
you have a nice smile.

766
00:41:23,413 --> 00:41:25,472
Oh, I would not go out with me, either.

767
00:41:27,483 --> 00:41:30,111
Excuse me, miss?
How come the mommy penguin

768
00:41:30,219 --> 00:41:32,585
doesn't bring back food
for the daddy penguin?

769
00:41:32,689 --> 00:41:35,123
'Cause the daddy penguin
doesn't need any food, sweetie.

770
00:41:39,062 --> 00:41:40,791
I have another question.

771
00:41:40,897 --> 00:41:43,388
Why won't you go out with Charlie?

772
00:41:44,901 --> 00:41:47,563
- She'd love to.
- Joe! You're my brother!

773
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:49,638
Why are you taking his side?

774
00:41:49,739 --> 00:41:51,764
Because I know
how long it's been-

775
00:41:52,976 --> 00:41:54,705
Another word,
I hide your stash.

776
00:41:56,245 --> 00:41:57,644
Go put a shirt on.

777
00:42:00,316 --> 00:42:01,544
Look, how about this.

778
00:42:01,651 --> 00:42:03,243
Why don't you eat,

779
00:42:03,353 --> 00:42:05,719
and I'll just digest my own lard.

780
00:42:07,624 --> 00:42:09,251
Look...

781
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:10,986
I just...

782
00:42:11,094 --> 00:42:13,358
I know three women
you've gone out with.

783
00:42:13,463 --> 00:42:15,556
I'm just not into dating
as a sport.

784
00:42:18,401 --> 00:42:20,301
Wait, you said if anybody
had any questions-

785
00:42:20,403 --> 00:42:22,394
- No! I'm not going out with you!
- That's not my question.

786
00:42:22,505 --> 00:42:24,666
That was the little girl's question.
I have a new question.

787
00:42:24,774 --> 00:42:26,969
What is that penguin
right there?

788
00:42:30,346 --> 00:42:32,746
That's a Gentoo,
one of several species

789
00:42:32,849 --> 00:42:35,613
of penguin that is
completely monogamous.

790
00:42:35,718 --> 00:42:37,379
I hope that answers
your question.

791
00:42:37,487 --> 00:42:39,114
Oh, and penguins are unique

792
00:42:39,222 --> 00:42:42,385
in that mate selection
is up to the female.

793
00:42:42,492 --> 00:42:44,687
Much like our relationship.

794
00:42:44,794 --> 00:42:46,728
Why do you wanna take me
to dinner so badly?

795
00:42:46,829 --> 00:42:48,023
You look hungry.

796
00:42:48,131 --> 00:42:49,393
Seriously.

797
00:42:50,833 --> 00:42:52,061
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

798
00:42:53,736 --> 00:42:55,966
Because you remind me
of these penguins.

799
00:42:58,341 --> 00:43:01,071
Yes, they're kind of
awkward and goofy.

800
00:43:02,712 --> 00:43:05,510
Yet in the water,
they're so beautiful.

801
00:43:12,555 --> 00:43:13,920
Okay.

802
00:43:14,023 --> 00:43:15,183
Okay, what?

803
00:43:15,291 --> 00:43:17,259
- Okay, dinner.
- Will you put that in writing?

804
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:19,328
Don't push it.

805
00:43:19,429 --> 00:43:21,556
But only as friends...

806
00:43:21,664 --> 00:43:24,064
because if you must know,
there is someone else.

807
00:43:26,169 --> 00:43:28,194
His name is Howard Blaine.

808
00:43:28,304 --> 00:43:30,272
He is a foremost expert on penguins,

809
00:43:30,373 --> 00:43:33,206
and I'm meeting him
later this year at a conference.

810
00:43:33,309 --> 00:43:35,140
I'm interested in him.

811
00:43:35,244 --> 00:43:36,404
Well, I'm interested
in choreographing

812
00:43:36,512 --> 00:43:39,072
a wacky line dance
that sweeps the nation,

813
00:43:39,182 --> 00:43:41,707
but we both know
that's never gonna happen.

814
00:43:41,818 --> 00:43:43,843
One date as friends.

815
00:43:43,953 --> 00:43:45,818
Fine.

816
00:43:45,922 --> 00:43:47,321
Bye.

817
00:43:48,958 --> 00:43:50,516
I'm okay.
Just-

818
00:43:50,626 --> 00:43:52,059
- Yeah.
- I'm fine.

819
00:43:54,697 --> 00:43:55,823
Bye.

820
00:44:13,049 --> 00:44:15,517
So do sharks get cavities?

821
00:44:15,618 --> 00:44:16,778
No.

822
00:44:16,886 --> 00:44:18,717
- You have no idea, do you.
- I don't know.

823
00:44:20,523 --> 00:44:22,320
I thought we were gonna
ask each other personal questions.

824
00:44:22,425 --> 00:44:24,484
Isn't that the point
of 100 Questions?

825
00:44:24,594 --> 00:44:25,856
Is that your question?

826
00:44:25,962 --> 00:44:29,261
No, my question is...

827
00:44:29,365 --> 00:44:31,765
Why penguins? Why?

828
00:44:31,868 --> 00:44:33,028
Why teeth?

829
00:44:33,136 --> 00:44:34,228
Same as every other dentist.

830
00:44:34,337 --> 00:44:35,395
Couldn't get
into med school.

831
00:44:35,505 --> 00:44:37,166
That's funny.

832
00:44:37,273 --> 00:44:39,366
My parents didn't think so.

833
00:44:39,475 --> 00:44:41,602
So really, why penguins?

834
00:44:41,711 --> 00:44:43,110
Couldn't get into shark school.

835
00:44:45,748 --> 00:44:47,739
I don't know,
lots of reasons.

836
00:44:47,850 --> 00:44:50,182
For one, you can't help but smile
when you see a penguin.

837
00:44:50,286 --> 00:44:53,778
Yeah, plus they have that bad-ass tuxedo
embedded in their flesh.

838
00:44:53,890 --> 00:44:55,118
I know! They're just so cute.

839
00:44:55,224 --> 00:44:56,714
I just-
I just love 'em so much.

840
00:44:56,826 --> 00:44:59,522
I just love, love, love 'em!

841
00:44:59,629 --> 00:45:02,325
I even go to Antarctica
for research.

842
00:45:02,431 --> 00:45:04,331
Oh, it's so beautiful there.

843
00:45:04,433 --> 00:45:07,197
You know they have
once-a-year sunsets?

844
00:45:07,303 --> 00:45:09,362
You haven't seen beauty
until you've seen that.

845
00:45:09,472 --> 00:45:11,497
Oh, I don't know about that.

846
00:45:14,477 --> 00:45:17,469
And the penguin rituals
are just fascinating.

847
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:20,048
Okay now, by rituals,
do you mean, like,

848
00:45:20,149 --> 00:45:21,616
eating their own poop?

849
00:45:21,717 --> 00:45:23,116
No.

850
00:45:23,219 --> 00:45:25,210
Like when a male
is sweet on a female,

851
00:45:25,321 --> 00:45:26,754
he searches
the entire beach

852
00:45:26,856 --> 00:45:29,347
to find the perfect pebble
to present to her.

853
00:45:29,458 --> 00:45:30,982
When he finally finds it,

854
00:45:31,093 --> 00:45:32,424
he waddles over

855
00:45:32,528 --> 00:45:35,361
and presents the stone
by placing it at her feet.

856
00:45:35,464 --> 00:45:37,989
If she accepts,
they'll be life-long mates.

857
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:39,795
It's kind of like
an engagement ring.

858
00:45:39,902 --> 00:45:42,462
Yeah, it's unbelievable to watch.

859
00:45:47,009 --> 00:45:48,636
I have a feeling

860
00:45:48,744 --> 00:45:50,678
that you are
a very good kisser.

861
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:54,079
And I know this because I spent
an hour and a half inside your mouth,

862
00:45:54,183 --> 00:45:55,650
and I scoped it out.

863
00:45:55,751 --> 00:45:58,049
What makes you think
I'll be kissing you, huh?

864
00:46:00,790 --> 00:46:01,688
You all right?

865
00:46:03,392 --> 00:46:04,916
You okay?

866
00:46:25,548 --> 00:46:27,880
I guess I was wrong about
the "really good kisser" thing.

867
00:46:30,052 --> 00:46:31,519
Come on, we'll find
something you're good at.

868
00:46:31,621 --> 00:46:32,713
What!

869
00:46:35,258 --> 00:46:37,954
Perfectly imperfect?
What the hell does that mean?

870
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:39,288
I don't know.

871
00:46:39,395 --> 00:46:42,330
I mean, haven't you ever
fallen for someone's flaws?

872
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:43,796
I'm a plastic surgeon.

873
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:46,892
I see a flaw,
I pour spackle over it.

874
00:46:47,003 --> 00:46:48,766
Hey, are these new?

875
00:46:48,871 --> 00:46:50,304
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, hey, no!

876
00:46:50,406 --> 00:46:54,001
No, you don't touch these.

877
00:46:54,110 --> 00:46:56,305
It's Pamela Anderson's
breast implants.

878
00:46:56,412 --> 00:46:58,437
Why are they not implanted
in her breasts?

879
00:46:58,547 --> 00:47:01,209
It's a reduction, baby.
This is what came out.

880
00:47:01,317 --> 00:47:03,785
So you're hoping that
some sick dude will buy these?

881
00:47:03,886 --> 00:47:06,252
Some sick dude already did.

882
00:47:06,355 --> 00:47:07,822
This dude!

883
00:47:07,924 --> 00:47:10,484
What the hell do you want
Pamela Anderson's breast fillings for?

884
00:47:10,593 --> 00:47:12,288
Why the hell do you want
Miss Penguin Pussy?

885
00:47:12,395 --> 00:47:14,226
To each his own, buddy.

886
00:47:14,330 --> 00:47:16,560
Oh, Miss Penguin Pussy.
Who the fuck are you?

887
00:47:16,666 --> 00:47:19,430
Stu Klaminsky.
Nice to meet you.

888
00:47:19,535 --> 00:47:22,732
Anyway, Cam's the one, man.

889
00:47:22,838 --> 00:47:25,272
When I'm with her,
I don't know, Stu.

890
00:47:25,374 --> 00:47:27,035
I mean, I feel like...

891
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:29,472
She just-
She-

892
00:47:29,578 --> 00:47:30,806
Completes you.

893
00:47:30,913 --> 00:47:32,141
- Screw you.
- Screw you.

894
00:47:32,248 --> 00:47:33,476
And can I just say

895
00:47:33,582 --> 00:47:35,413
that I'm an idiot
for listening to you?

896
00:47:35,518 --> 00:47:36,485
Public service.

897
00:47:36,585 --> 00:47:37,483
May I remind you

898
00:47:37,586 --> 00:47:38,883
that you got
your axle greased

899
00:47:38,988 --> 00:47:40,285
a fair amount
in the process?

900
00:47:40,389 --> 00:47:42,880
What's sex without love?

901
00:47:43,826 --> 00:47:45,225
Sex!

902
00:47:45,328 --> 00:47:48,388
It's still sex!

903
00:47:48,497 --> 00:47:50,124
Jesus Christ.

904
00:47:50,232 --> 00:47:53,395
I never met a guy so bummed
to squirt a little baby gravy.

905
00:47:53,502 --> 00:47:54,662
Baby gravy?

906
00:47:54,770 --> 00:47:56,897
You know, man chowder.

907
00:48:00,343 --> 00:48:02,504
Can't believe you're going
cold turkey for this chick.

908
00:48:02,611 --> 00:48:04,442
If she wants me to be
more like a Gentoo,

909
00:48:04,547 --> 00:48:07,038
I'm going to be
like a Gentoo.

910
00:48:07,149 --> 00:48:08,446
You lost me.

911
00:48:08,551 --> 00:48:11,076
Gentoo.
It's a monogamous penguin.

912
00:48:11,187 --> 00:48:15,624
Who's ridiculed
by the other penguins

913
00:48:15,725 --> 00:48:18,023
for being a fag.

914
00:48:20,162 --> 00:48:21,925
Here it comes!

915
00:48:29,739 --> 00:48:32,207
You got some- right there.

916
00:48:32,308 --> 00:48:33,536
Thanks.

917
00:48:33,642 --> 00:48:35,041
Do I have any on me?

918
00:48:35,144 --> 00:48:36,042
No, no.

919
00:48:36,145 --> 00:48:37,442
You want to get that?

920
00:48:38,748 --> 00:48:39,976
You're silly.

921
00:48:41,751 --> 00:48:43,616
I have something for you.

922
00:48:43,719 --> 00:48:44,708
Really?

923
00:48:45,821 --> 00:48:47,288
A gift?

924
00:48:47,390 --> 00:48:48,914
Oh, bad form.

925
00:48:49,025 --> 00:48:50,424
A gift on the third date?

926
00:48:50,526 --> 00:48:51,788
Open it.

927
00:48:51,894 --> 00:48:53,293
Okay.

928
00:48:57,466 --> 00:48:59,525
You're an asshole.

929
00:48:59,635 --> 00:49:01,626
Yes, but a thoughtful asshole.

930
00:49:01,737 --> 00:49:03,295
Thank you.

931
00:49:05,975 --> 00:49:08,307
So, fess up about this charm.

932
00:49:09,412 --> 00:49:10,470
You heard about that.

933
00:49:10,579 --> 00:49:13,047
Yeah. It's quite a scam
you got going.

934
00:49:13,149 --> 00:49:14,639
- No, it's not me.
- Please.

935
00:49:14,750 --> 00:49:15,876
It's not.
I'm serious.

936
00:49:15,985 --> 00:49:17,612
Somebody somewhere
got it into their head

937
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:19,347
that once a girl's
been with me,

938
00:49:19,455 --> 00:49:20,581
she'll meet her true love

939
00:49:20,689 --> 00:49:22,520
with the next guy
she goes out with.

940
00:49:22,625 --> 00:49:23,649
Can you believe it?

941
00:49:23,759 --> 00:49:25,158
Please.

942
00:49:25,261 --> 00:49:27,821
People will believe
whatever they want to believe.

943
00:49:41,744 --> 00:49:43,302
Okay. I've got one for you.

944
00:49:43,412 --> 00:49:44,936
Did you know
it is physically impossible

945
00:49:45,047 --> 00:49:47,072
for a human being
to lick their own elbow?

946
00:49:47,183 --> 00:49:48,275
How do you know that?

947
00:49:48,384 --> 00:49:49,373
No one can do it.

948
00:49:49,485 --> 00:49:51,112
All right.
I can do it.

949
00:49:55,791 --> 00:49:57,554
Can't do it, my friend.

950
00:49:57,660 --> 00:49:58,888
All right, fine.

951
00:49:58,994 --> 00:50:00,086
I've got one.

952
00:50:00,196 --> 00:50:01,857
Did you know
that the average person

953
00:50:01,964 --> 00:50:04,125
produces 10,000 gallons of saliva
in their lifetime?

954
00:50:04,233 --> 00:50:08,033
Did you know that I produce
10,000 gallons of saliva in one kiss?

955
00:50:08,137 --> 00:50:09,161
That's disgusting.

956
00:50:09,271 --> 00:50:10,670
I'm going to show you.
Come here.

957
00:50:10,773 --> 00:50:12,172
I'm serious.
I'm serious about this.

958
00:50:12,274 --> 00:50:14,037
I don't like sloppy kisses.

959
00:50:46,142 --> 00:50:47,837
Are you trying to unhook my bra?

960
00:50:47,943 --> 00:50:51,435
No. No.
I wouldn't do that. No.

961
00:50:51,547 --> 00:50:53,879
Why not?
Am I not your type?

962
00:50:53,983 --> 00:50:55,974
You are definitely my type.

963
00:50:56,085 --> 00:50:57,143
What's your type?

964
00:50:57,253 --> 00:50:59,813
Black and blue,
riddled with bandages.

965
00:51:01,290 --> 00:51:04,123
And braless.
Yeah. Definitely braless.

966
00:51:20,042 --> 00:51:22,010
Your move.

967
00:51:27,783 --> 00:51:28,875
That's it?

968
00:51:28,984 --> 00:51:30,508
Socks are next.
Slow down.

969
00:51:30,619 --> 00:51:32,109
Wuss.

970
00:51:37,126 --> 00:51:38,559
You really want to do this?

971
00:51:38,661 --> 00:51:41,061
I mean, you really want
to take us further?

972
00:51:54,176 --> 00:51:56,007
This is not happening.

973
00:51:59,648 --> 00:52:01,275
I got to get it.

974
00:52:01,383 --> 00:52:03,283
It's- It's my emergency line.

975
00:52:03,385 --> 00:52:04,283
No. No.

976
00:52:04,386 --> 00:52:06,354
I got to get it.
I'll be back.

977
00:52:06,455 --> 00:52:07,581
I'll be fast.

978
00:52:11,427 --> 00:52:12,485
Dr. Logan speaking.

979
00:52:12,595 --> 00:52:14,290
Dude!

980
00:52:15,798 --> 00:52:17,698
Is this an emergency?

981
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:19,461
You're going to want
to hear this, man.

982
00:52:19,568 --> 00:52:22,594
Well, I am rather busy
right now.

983
00:52:22,705 --> 00:52:23,797
Good night!

984
00:52:23,906 --> 00:52:25,737
Whoa, whoa, wait.
Did you bone her yet?

985
00:52:25,841 --> 00:52:28,708
Look, unless
this is an emergency,

986
00:52:28,811 --> 00:52:30,972
call my office
in the morning.

987
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:33,344
Fine. You want
to lose her forever,

988
00:52:33,449 --> 00:52:35,110
you hang up the phone
right now.

989
00:52:35,217 --> 00:52:38,152
This is going to be
the best night of your life.

990
00:52:38,254 --> 00:52:39,846
Are you still there?

991
00:52:39,955 --> 00:52:43,356
Chuck. Are you there?

992
00:52:43,459 --> 00:52:44,756
What are you
talking about?

993
00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:47,158
Dude, it's that charm thing.

994
00:52:47,263 --> 00:52:49,663
It turns out it's real!

995
00:52:49,765 --> 00:52:53,531
No. That's not true
because you told me yourself-

996
00:52:53,636 --> 00:52:55,069
Uh-uh, but now I believe.

997
00:52:55,170 --> 00:52:57,035
I started
calling all your exes.

998
00:52:57,139 --> 00:52:58,470
They're married.

999
00:52:58,574 --> 00:53:00,098
Not just some. All.

1000
00:53:00,209 --> 00:53:02,336
A to Z on your Palm Pilot, man.

1001
00:53:02,444 --> 00:53:04,139
Susan Agrezzi
to Jeannie Zeigert.

1002
00:53:04,246 --> 00:53:06,578
Every single one
you closed the deal with.

1003
00:53:06,682 --> 00:53:09,310
And did you see this month's
high school newsletter?

1004
00:53:09,418 --> 00:53:10,783
Sarah McDowell.

1005
00:53:10,886 --> 00:53:12,649
What, the girl
I lost my virginity to?

1006
00:53:12,755 --> 00:53:14,484
Did you see who she
wound up marrying?

1007
00:53:14,590 --> 00:53:18,048
Tony Lamberto, that douche bag
she dumped you for!

1008
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:21,152
You know what this means,
don't you?

1009
00:53:21,263 --> 00:53:22,628
You shake the sheets with Cam,

1010
00:53:22,731 --> 00:53:24,892
she's going to marry
the next guy she dates.

1011
00:53:26,302 --> 00:53:28,930
This- This-

1012
00:53:29,038 --> 00:53:30,335
I hate you.

1013
00:53:30,439 --> 00:53:32,907
I really hate you!

1014
00:53:36,945 --> 00:53:38,810
I got to go.
I got to go.

1015
00:53:38,914 --> 00:53:40,677
A dental emergency.

1016
00:53:40,783 --> 00:53:42,910
Freak accident.

1017
00:53:43,018 --> 00:53:45,578
Children, they thought
it was gumballs.

1018
00:53:45,688 --> 00:53:47,155
Ball bearings,

1019
00:53:47,256 --> 00:53:49,747
and it just fucked up
their shit.

1020
00:53:51,293 --> 00:53:53,193
You look great.
I had a good time.

1021
00:53:53,295 --> 00:53:54,284
I got to go.

1022
00:53:56,398 --> 00:53:57,365
I got to go!

1023
00:54:00,002 --> 00:54:01,902
I can't believe you're
really considering doing this.

1024
00:54:02,004 --> 00:54:04,165
If you believe it
and everyone else believes it,

1025
00:54:04,273 --> 00:54:05,467
what else can I do?

1026
00:54:05,574 --> 00:54:06,632
Anything but this.

1027
00:54:06,742 --> 00:54:07,834
I got to be sure.

1028
00:54:07,943 --> 00:54:09,968
I've got to put the curse to the test.

1029
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:11,944
Where is she?

1030
00:54:12,047 --> 00:54:13,480
She's beached over there

1031
00:54:13,582 --> 00:54:16,949
by the giant garbage bag
full of doughnut holes.

1032
00:54:17,052 --> 00:54:19,247
Eleanor Skepple.

1033
00:54:19,355 --> 00:54:23,155
She's angry, rude,
and she smells bad.

1034
00:54:23,258 --> 00:54:24,885
In addition to back acne,

1035
00:54:24,993 --> 00:54:29,123
she's got front acne
and side acne.

1036
00:54:29,231 --> 00:54:31,358
You see that glass of water there?

1037
00:54:31,467 --> 00:54:33,435
She keeps her teeth
in that glass.

1038
00:54:33,535 --> 00:54:37,266
So you're saying
that she's single.

1039
00:54:37,373 --> 00:54:38,738
She's your best bet, man.

1040
00:54:38,841 --> 00:54:40,502
You sink the soldier all you want.

1041
00:54:40,609 --> 00:54:41,940
This chick ain't never
getting married.

1042
00:54:42,044 --> 00:54:44,205
If she was the last woman
on the face of the earth,

1043
00:54:44,313 --> 00:54:47,282
humanity would come
to a screeching halt.

1044
00:55:04,867 --> 00:55:08,325
Hey, asshole,
got my peanut butter?

1045
00:55:08,437 --> 00:55:11,998
No. My name's Charlie.

1046
00:55:16,612 --> 00:55:18,204
I'm sorry.
I was just wondering

1047
00:55:18,313 --> 00:55:21,407
if, um- if I could
take you out tonight.

1048
00:55:21,517 --> 00:55:24,213
How does that-
How does that sound?

1049
00:55:27,356 --> 00:55:29,324
You want me to elaborate?

1050
00:55:29,425 --> 00:55:31,325
No. I get your drift.

1051
00:55:31,427 --> 00:55:33,019
I'm sorry to have bothered you.

1052
00:55:39,835 --> 00:55:42,395
Pay you a hundred dollars
to go out with me tonight.

1053
00:55:45,307 --> 00:55:46,535
$200.

1054
00:55:49,111 --> 00:55:50,237
Make me happy.

1055
00:55:58,620 --> 00:55:59,814
So a thousand dollars,

1056
00:55:59,922 --> 00:56:02,550
and all you have to do
is take me to dinner?

1057
00:56:04,026 --> 00:56:06,586
Well, actually, I thought
that maybe we could,

1058
00:56:06,695 --> 00:56:09,755
you know, we-
you and I could, uh-

1059
00:56:15,404 --> 00:56:16,735
get physical.

1060
00:56:18,307 --> 00:56:20,605
All right.

1061
00:56:20,709 --> 00:56:24,770
I'm gonna fuck you
till you die!

1062
00:56:43,131 --> 00:56:44,792
And now we wait.

1063
00:56:48,537 --> 00:56:52,837
Oh, Coco,
I know how you feel.

1064
00:56:52,941 --> 00:56:54,909
We just put ourselves
out there,

1065
00:56:55,010 --> 00:56:56,136
and what happened?

1066
00:56:56,245 --> 00:56:57,906
I'm left hanging.

1067
00:56:58,013 --> 00:57:00,106
Huh, girl?

1068
00:57:02,885 --> 00:57:04,614
Has he called yet?

1069
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:07,245
No, Joe, he hasn't.

1070
00:57:07,356 --> 00:57:11,122
Thanks for asking.
I really appreciate it.

1071
00:57:11,226 --> 00:57:13,660
God, I feel so stupid.

1072
00:57:13,762 --> 00:57:16,094
Why did I act like that?

1073
00:57:17,466 --> 00:57:18,933
Why hasn't he called?

1074
00:57:19,034 --> 00:57:22,060
All this waiting
is driving me crazy.

1075
00:57:22,170 --> 00:57:26,106
You know, there's always
some madness in love.

1076
00:57:26,208 --> 00:57:31,942
But there's also always
some reason in madness.

1077
00:57:33,382 --> 00:57:35,043
Nietzsche.

1078
00:57:35,150 --> 00:57:37,175
Been using the pages
of this philosophy book

1079
00:57:37,286 --> 00:57:38,378
for rolling paper.

1080
00:57:38,487 --> 00:57:41,388
It's like I'm smoking
their thoughts.

1081
00:57:48,397 --> 00:57:49,386
It's him.

1082
00:57:49,498 --> 00:57:51,398
Well, get it.

1083
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:53,092
I'm gonna let it ring.

1084
00:57:56,238 --> 00:57:57,830
I'll screen it.

1085
00:57:57,940 --> 00:58:00,101
Sorry I haven't called,
but I've been really sick.

1086
00:58:01,443 --> 00:58:03,104
I can't even get out of bed.

1087
00:58:03,211 --> 00:58:05,907
Do you think maybe we could
just talk on the phone

1088
00:58:06,014 --> 00:58:07,106
or on the computer?

1089
00:58:08,951 --> 00:58:10,851
I'd really, really like that.

1090
00:58:10,953 --> 00:58:12,352
Call me.

1091
00:59:35,003 --> 00:59:36,436
I can't pretend
to be sick forever.

1092
00:59:36,538 --> 00:59:37,664
Come on, man.
You're my hero.

1093
00:59:37,773 --> 00:59:39,764
- I don't know.
- Yeah, you gotta do this for me.

1094
00:59:39,875 --> 00:59:41,900
You got this, my brother.
You're a crazy train.

1095
00:59:42,010 --> 00:59:43,671
You're the man
in the mirror.

1096
00:59:43,779 --> 00:59:45,440
You're a force of nature.
Hurricane Stu.

1097
00:59:45,547 --> 00:59:46,445
I can't do it.

1098
00:59:46,548 --> 00:59:47,742
You have to do it.

1099
00:59:47,849 --> 00:59:49,248
No one's asked her out yet.

1100
00:59:49,351 --> 00:59:51,842
Yeah, right. So I go out
with Eleanor Skepple

1101
00:59:51,953 --> 00:59:52,920
to test your curse,

1102
00:59:53,021 --> 00:59:54,283
and what happens next?

1103
00:59:54,389 --> 00:59:56,050
I'm walking down the aisle
with Shamu!

1104
00:59:56,158 --> 00:59:57,216
I don't think so.

1105
00:59:57,325 --> 00:59:59,054
Do you see what I'm doing here?

1106
01:00:00,429 --> 01:00:01,691
The friend card, man?

1107
01:00:01,797 --> 01:00:02,729
Yeah.

1108
01:00:02,831 --> 01:00:03,855
That's mean.

1109
01:00:03,965 --> 01:00:05,990
You leave me no choice.

1110
01:00:07,469 --> 01:00:10,495
Give me that,
you son of a bitch.

1111
01:00:10,605 --> 01:00:12,232
If I marry her, Chuck,

1112
01:00:12,340 --> 01:00:14,638
we're going to hunt you down
and eat you.

1113
01:00:29,057 --> 01:00:30,115
Yeah, Stu.

1114
01:00:34,396 --> 01:00:36,330
I can't believe
you're still sick.

1115
01:00:36,431 --> 01:00:37,830
How long has it been?

1116
01:00:37,933 --> 01:00:39,764
Two weeks. It's, uh...

1117
01:00:39,868 --> 01:00:41,165
it's killing me,
but, you know,

1118
01:00:41,269 --> 01:00:42,600
I don't
want to infect you.

1119
01:00:42,704 --> 01:00:44,865
At this point,
I wouldn't mind.

1120
01:00:46,975 --> 01:00:48,738
You know, I feel
like a kid again.

1121
01:00:48,844 --> 01:00:50,641
I haven't talked
on the phone this much

1122
01:00:50,746 --> 01:00:52,043
since I was in high school.

1123
01:00:52,147 --> 01:00:53,444
That reminds me.

1124
01:00:53,548 --> 01:00:55,607
Would you go to the prom with me?

1125
01:00:56,952 --> 01:00:58,783
I love your voice.

1126
01:00:58,887 --> 01:01:02,084
The crazy things is,
I can't picture you anymore.

1127
01:01:02,190 --> 01:01:04,124
Okay, here's the update:

1128
01:01:04,226 --> 01:01:05,488
I am now 4' 3",

1129
01:01:05,594 --> 01:01:09,121
I weigh 235 pounds,
and I've got a cleft eye.

1130
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:12,899
Can I ask you something?

1131
01:01:13,001 --> 01:01:14,229
Yeah.

1132
01:01:14,336 --> 01:01:16,668
Are you not into girls?

1133
01:01:21,710 --> 01:01:24,270
No.
No.

1134
01:01:24,379 --> 01:01:27,143
Are you... seriously, are you there?

1135
01:01:27,249 --> 01:01:28,147
Yeah.

1136
01:01:28,250 --> 01:01:29,774
I'm not... not into girls.

1137
01:01:29,885 --> 01:01:31,750
You should have seen
my room growing up.

1138
01:01:31,853 --> 01:01:33,844
It was full of posters of... of girls!

1139
01:01:33,955 --> 01:01:35,786
There was no guys.
It was girls!

1140
01:01:35,891 --> 01:01:39,088
Well, are you avoiding
actually seeing me?

1141
01:01:39,194 --> 01:01:42,630
No, Cam. I'm dying to see you.
It's killing me.

1142
01:01:42,731 --> 01:01:45,791
Then come over.
Right now. Wash my back.

1143
01:01:45,901 --> 01:01:46,993
Come on.

1144
01:01:47,102 --> 01:01:49,263
I'll wear a mask.
You could wear a mask.

1145
01:01:49,371 --> 01:01:50,269
We'll play doctor.

1146
01:01:50,372 --> 01:01:52,897
Ooh, boy. I want to,

1147
01:01:53,008 --> 01:01:54,168
but with the-

1148
01:01:54,276 --> 01:01:55,868
No buts.
I need to see you.

1149
01:01:55,977 --> 01:01:58,036
I need to see if that
birthmark you have

1150
01:01:58,146 --> 01:01:59,272
really looks like Alfred Hitchcock.

1151
01:01:59,381 --> 01:02:01,144
Now, wait. No. That-

1152
01:02:01,249 --> 01:02:03,410
That is a restricted area, okay?

1153
01:02:03,518 --> 01:02:04,815
Not everybody gets a peek

1154
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:06,387
at the Master of Suspense,

1155
01:02:06,488 --> 01:02:07,750
if you know
what I'm saying.

1156
01:02:07,856 --> 01:02:08,948
If I can't see you,

1157
01:02:09,057 --> 01:02:10,388
we should take
our phone relationship

1158
01:02:10,492 --> 01:02:11,584
to the next level.

1159
01:02:12,761 --> 01:02:13,955
What do you mean?

1160
01:02:16,565 --> 01:02:17,759
Oh, yeah.

1161
01:02:17,866 --> 01:02:19,595
That feels good.

1162
01:02:19,701 --> 01:02:22,397
I like that.
Do you like that?

1163
01:02:22,504 --> 01:02:23,937
Like what?

1164
01:02:24,039 --> 01:02:25,336
That's my phone sex voice.

1165
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:28,705
Come on, Charlie,
work with me here.

1166
01:02:28,810 --> 01:02:31,711
I want to. I just don't
think that we should do that.

1167
01:02:31,813 --> 01:02:33,644
I mean, nothing to do with-

1168
01:02:33,748 --> 01:02:34,874
Does your phone
receive pictures?

1169
01:02:34,983 --> 01:02:36,007
Yeah, why?

1170
01:02:36,117 --> 01:02:37,015
Sending.

1171
01:02:37,118 --> 01:02:38,278
Sending?

1172
01:02:38,386 --> 01:02:39,944
What are you sending to me?

1173
01:02:41,623 --> 01:02:42,521
Fuck!

1174
01:02:44,693 --> 01:02:45,819
- I got it.
- Got it?

1175
01:02:45,927 --> 01:02:47,485
I'm done for the night.
Thank you.

1176
01:02:48,597 --> 01:02:49,928
Oh, God.
Hold on one second.

1177
01:02:50,031 --> 01:02:50,998
Stu, what's up?

1178
01:02:52,534 --> 01:02:54,593
The deed is done.

1179
01:02:54,703 --> 01:02:56,830
I went out
with Eleanor Skepple.

1180
01:02:56,938 --> 01:02:58,701
I'm not proposing to her,

1181
01:02:58,807 --> 01:03:00,798
so you're in the clear.

1182
01:03:02,477 --> 01:03:03,535
Are you there?

1183
01:03:03,645 --> 01:03:05,272
Chuck?

1184
01:03:10,285 --> 01:03:11,377
I feel better.

1185
01:04:00,302 --> 01:04:01,929
Camcorder in the bedroom, huh?

1186
01:04:02,037 --> 01:04:03,004
Kinky.

1187
01:04:09,511 --> 01:04:11,945
So, for the, uh, camera,

1188
01:04:12,047 --> 01:04:14,641
do I have to sign a waiver
or something, you know,

1189
01:04:14,749 --> 01:04:15,841
for internet purposes?

1190
01:04:15,951 --> 01:04:17,782
You really want
to talk right now?

1191
01:04:19,087 --> 01:04:21,214
Whoa, those are nice.

1192
01:04:21,323 --> 01:04:23,018
Oh, God bless you.

1193
01:04:25,160 --> 01:04:26,058
You pushed me.

1194
01:04:26,161 --> 01:04:27,788
Sorry.
It's been a while.

1195
01:04:27,896 --> 01:04:30,296
I can see I'm going
to have to wear protection.

1196
01:04:53,655 --> 01:04:55,623
Stop staring at me.

1197
01:04:55,724 --> 01:04:58,090
You're creeping me out.

1198
01:05:27,355 --> 01:05:29,380
...no matter what your size.

1199
01:05:29,491 --> 01:05:31,015
You will not go to waste.

1200
01:05:31,126 --> 01:05:32,525
Sometimes it takes
a little love

1201
01:05:32,627 --> 01:05:35,061
to make someone want
to shed the pounds.

1202
01:05:35,163 --> 01:05:36,790
Two main reasons-

1203
01:05:47,175 --> 01:05:48,699
What the hell?

1204
01:05:52,047 --> 01:05:53,071
Hello.

1205
01:05:53,181 --> 01:05:55,581
"The deed is done"?
The deed is done!

1206
01:05:55,683 --> 01:05:56,775
I thought you said

1207
01:05:56,885 --> 01:05:58,284
you went out
with Eleanor Skepple.

1208
01:05:58,386 --> 01:05:59,751
No, man. I just said that.

1209
01:05:59,854 --> 01:06:01,446
What?

1210
01:06:01,556 --> 01:06:02,955
I didn't want to risk it.

1211
01:06:03,058 --> 01:06:04,389
Marrying her?
Are you stupid?

1212
01:06:04,492 --> 01:06:05,652
But I saw you, man.

1213
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:07,387
You asked her out.

1214
01:06:07,495 --> 01:06:09,486
No, man. I asked her
what time it was.

1215
01:06:09,597 --> 01:06:11,258
She said it was 3:53.

1216
01:06:14,335 --> 01:06:15,893
I can't believe
that I trusted you, Stu.

1217
01:06:16,004 --> 01:06:16,993
You fucked me!

1218
01:06:17,105 --> 01:06:18,299
Take out your friend card.

1219
01:06:18,406 --> 01:06:19,998
What?

1220
01:06:20,108 --> 01:06:22,508
Take out your friend card now
and rip it up

1221
01:06:22,610 --> 01:06:23,872
because you fucked me, Stu.

1222
01:06:23,978 --> 01:06:26,879
Oh, buddy, she's just a girl.

1223
01:06:26,981 --> 01:06:30,109
No. It's not a girl.

1224
01:06:32,987 --> 01:06:34,045
It's the girl.

1225
01:06:34,155 --> 01:06:36,715
Now I'm going to lose her.

1226
01:06:40,128 --> 01:06:42,392
I'm not going to lose her.

1227
01:06:50,105 --> 01:06:52,130
Breakfast in bed.

1228
01:06:53,508 --> 01:06:57,501
Wake up! Good morning!
It's a beautiful day!

1229
01:06:57,612 --> 01:06:59,079
Wow.

1230
01:06:59,180 --> 01:07:01,512
Am I supposed to eat
my way out of here?

1231
01:07:01,616 --> 01:07:03,208
I walked into the supermarket.

1232
01:07:03,318 --> 01:07:05,616
I stood there. I was like,
"What does Cam want?"

1233
01:07:05,720 --> 01:07:06,778
And I couldn't stop.

1234
01:07:06,888 --> 01:07:09,857
I was like, "She'll want that
and that and that," and I got it all.

1235
01:07:09,958 --> 01:07:12,119
They didn't have Spam, though.
I talked to the manager.

1236
01:07:12,227 --> 01:07:14,161
They won't have it in until next week.
Anyway, enjoy.

1237
01:07:14,262 --> 01:07:15,923
Are you okay?

1238
01:07:16,030 --> 01:07:17,429
I am fantastic.
I feel like-

1239
01:07:17,532 --> 01:07:19,022
I did this-

1240
01:07:19,501 --> 01:07:21,093
And then I gave myself
one of these. Look.

1241
01:07:21,202 --> 01:07:22,931
And I made out with myself.

1242
01:07:23,805 --> 01:07:25,136
You're acting kind of strange.

1243
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:26,764
No. No, no.

1244
01:07:28,676 --> 01:07:30,644
Yeah, eat up. Eat up.
Try that. Try that.

1245
01:07:30,745 --> 01:07:31,939
Eat up.

1246
01:07:32,046 --> 01:07:34,207
Hey, um, what are your plans

1247
01:07:34,315 --> 01:07:35,805
for the rest of today?

1248
01:07:35,917 --> 01:07:38,385
I'm going to work.

1249
01:07:38,486 --> 01:07:40,147
I'm going to go
to work with you!

1250
01:07:40,255 --> 01:07:41,483
I'm going to hang out.

1251
01:07:41,589 --> 01:07:43,955
I got it all planned out.
I'm going to go.

1252
01:07:45,727 --> 01:07:47,718
I'm kidding.
I'm not going to work with you.

1253
01:07:47,829 --> 01:07:49,057
Actually, Saturday.

1254
01:07:49,164 --> 01:07:50,461
What are you plans for Saturday- Sunday?

1255
01:07:50,565 --> 01:07:51,497
What are your plans
for Sunday?

1256
01:07:51,599 --> 01:07:52,827
Don't even answer that

1257
01:07:52,934 --> 01:07:54,367
because I'm already
thinking about Wednesday.

1258
01:07:54,469 --> 01:07:55,595
What are you doing Wednesday?

1259
01:07:55,703 --> 01:07:57,330
Let's just seal it right now-
seal the deal-

1260
01:07:57,438 --> 01:07:58,928
and then I'll do my pineapple dance.

1261
01:07:59,040 --> 01:08:00,769
Yes, Wednesday?

1262
01:08:03,578 --> 01:08:06,103
This is your fault!
Everything!

1263
01:08:06,214 --> 01:08:09,672
You!

1264
01:08:10,852 --> 01:08:13,548
Jesus Christ, why me?

1265
01:08:13,655 --> 01:08:16,453
Just shut your lips, Stu.
Shut up!

1266
01:08:18,826 --> 01:08:20,851
Hi, Cam. What's up?
It's Charlie.

1267
01:08:20,962 --> 01:08:22,020
How are you doing today?

1268
01:08:22,130 --> 01:08:23,290
I just wanted to call

1269
01:08:23,398 --> 01:08:25,298
and make sure I had
the right number,

1270
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:27,800
and I do, and I do.

1271
01:08:27,902 --> 01:08:29,028
How are you doing?

1272
01:08:29,137 --> 01:08:30,536
Having a good day at work?

1273
01:08:30,638 --> 01:08:32,970
Well, I'll let you get back,
but I wanted to remind you,

1274
01:08:33,074 --> 01:08:36,134
Wednesday night,
you and me, happily.

1275
01:08:36,244 --> 01:08:38,542
All right.
I'll talk to you later. Bye.

1276
01:08:38,646 --> 01:08:40,011
This is your fault!

1277
01:08:40,114 --> 01:08:41,513
His!

1278
01:08:45,486 --> 01:08:47,954
You already ate.
Why are you-

1279
01:08:57,632 --> 01:09:00,396
Is there something different
in here since lunch?

1280
01:09:26,294 --> 01:09:28,660
Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, banana

1281
01:09:28,763 --> 01:09:31,493
Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, banana

1282
01:09:31,599 --> 01:09:33,931
Got me lookin'
so crazy right now

1283
01:09:34,035 --> 01:09:36,902
Your love's got me
lookin' so crazy right now

1284
01:09:37,005 --> 01:09:39,496
Got me lookin'
so crazy right now

1285
01:09:39,607 --> 01:09:42,337
Your touch has got me
lookin' so crazy right now

1286
01:09:42,443 --> 01:09:45,105
Got me hopin'
you'd page me right now

1287
01:09:45,213 --> 01:09:48,239
Your kiss got me hopin'
you'd save me right now

1288
01:09:48,349 --> 01:09:50,840
Lookin' so crazy,
your love's got me lookin'

1289
01:09:50,952 --> 01:09:55,548
Got me lookin' so crazy,
your love

1290
01:09:55,657 --> 01:09:57,352
Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, got it.

1291
01:09:57,458 --> 01:09:59,653
Got me going,
so pay me right now

1292
01:10:01,596 --> 01:10:03,791
Raise the habitat.

1293
01:10:03,898 --> 01:10:05,991
Crazy, crazy, crazy

1294
01:10:06,100 --> 01:10:08,261
Crazy for you

1295
01:10:10,338 --> 01:10:11,327
Changed my mind.

1296
01:10:11,439 --> 01:10:12,997
Took the day off
so I could hang.

1297
01:10:13,107 --> 01:10:14,335
I won't be in the way.

1298
01:10:14,442 --> 01:10:16,706
I know what you're thinking.
I'm going to be in the way.

1299
01:10:16,811 --> 01:10:19,678
But I think I'm going to blend in like this.
I think I'll blend. Look.

1300
01:10:19,781 --> 01:10:21,339
I know how to do that.

1301
01:10:21,449 --> 01:10:24,782
Charlie, I'm working.

1302
01:10:30,391 --> 01:10:32,291
Or I could go.

1303
01:10:32,393 --> 01:10:33,792
Yeah, I-

1304
01:10:36,564 --> 01:10:37,758
Get out of here.

1305
01:10:39,667 --> 01:10:40,759
No, no.

1306
01:10:40,868 --> 01:10:41,892
Thanks.

1307
01:10:50,545 --> 01:10:52,035
Have a great day at work.

1308
01:10:53,081 --> 01:10:54,912
My car's this way.

1309
01:11:08,129 --> 01:11:09,289
Hi, Cam.

1310
01:11:17,572 --> 01:11:19,369
Work is done.
Time for fun.

1311
01:11:23,277 --> 01:11:24,437
Hey.

1312
01:11:26,381 --> 01:11:27,939
Listen, I know
an amazing sushi place,

1313
01:11:28,049 --> 01:11:29,380
and the best part of all:

1314
01:11:29,484 --> 01:11:30,781
when you're finished
with your leftovers,

1315
01:11:30,885 --> 01:11:33,080
they put them in a doggie bag-
or a penguin bag.

1316
01:11:33,187 --> 01:11:34,779
- Charlie-
- Oh, you don't like sushi.

1317
01:11:34,889 --> 01:11:36,447
Uh, Thai? Indian.

1318
01:11:36,557 --> 01:11:39,526
Listen to me, you need
to leave me alone, okay?

1319
01:11:39,627 --> 01:11:40,924
I need some space.

1320
01:11:43,498 --> 01:11:44,760
So tonight is no good.

1321
01:11:44,866 --> 01:11:48,825
I'm very close
to changing my phone number.

1322
01:11:48,936 --> 01:11:50,767
Do you understand?

1323
01:12:07,488 --> 01:12:09,513
If you were a hamburger
at McDonald's,

1324
01:12:09,624 --> 01:12:11,990
I'd name you my
McBeautiful Tittie Sandwich

1325
01:12:12,093 --> 01:12:13,492
With Titties On Top.

1326
01:12:27,475 --> 01:12:29,204
- Can I see Stu?
- Just a sec-

1327
01:12:29,310 --> 01:12:30,436
Yeah.

1328
01:12:30,545 --> 01:12:33,309
Stu, I need you.
It's important.

1329
01:12:33,414 --> 01:12:35,609
I'm Dr. Charlie Logan.

1330
01:12:35,716 --> 01:12:38,310
I don't know who this Stu
is you speak of.

1331
01:12:48,596 --> 01:12:49,494
Call me.

1332
01:12:49,597 --> 01:12:50,621
I need your help.

1333
01:12:50,731 --> 01:12:52,631
Hey, are we still friends?

1334
01:12:52,733 --> 01:12:55,031
Cam is going to fall in love with
and get married

1335
01:12:55,136 --> 01:12:57,263
to the next guy she goes
on a date with, right?

1336
01:12:57,371 --> 01:12:59,464
I'm going to be that next guy.

1337
01:12:59,574 --> 01:13:01,098
Yeah.
You're a plastic surgeon.

1338
01:13:01,209 --> 01:13:03,905
You're going to...
change my face up.

1339
01:13:04,011 --> 01:13:06,138
I don't care if you
give me a beak.

1340
01:13:06,247 --> 01:13:08,147
I'm going to look
like a different guy.

1341
01:13:08,249 --> 01:13:09,477
That way,
when I meet her-

1342
01:13:09,584 --> 01:13:10,676
Hi. My name's Ronald-

1343
01:13:10,785 --> 01:13:12,878
I'm the new guy
she falls in love with.

1344
01:13:12,987 --> 01:13:14,045
Let's go. Right now.

1345
01:13:14,155 --> 01:13:16,350
Don't look at me
in that tone of voice.

1346
01:13:16,457 --> 01:13:18,925
I'm talking the truth.
Please?

1347
01:13:19,026 --> 01:13:20,994
Chuck...

1348
01:13:21,095 --> 01:13:23,029
take a look around, man.

1349
01:13:23,130 --> 01:13:25,928
I mean, I can give you tits.
You want tits?

1350
01:13:26,033 --> 01:13:28,831
So you're
not going to help me.

1351
01:13:28,936 --> 01:13:32,372
Yes, but not by
rearranging your face, man.

1352
01:13:32,473 --> 01:13:34,134
Come here. Have a seat.

1353
01:13:35,376 --> 01:13:36,775
There's got to be
a better way, right?

1354
01:13:37,879 --> 01:13:39,744
I mean, I know
things are bad now,

1355
01:13:39,847 --> 01:13:42,748
but things could be
a lot worse, right?

1356
01:13:42,850 --> 01:13:45,444
Listen, you could be
like my cousin, man.

1357
01:13:45,553 --> 01:13:47,043
He found out last week

1358
01:13:47,154 --> 01:13:48,951
he's got an inoperable
brain tumor.

1359
01:13:50,858 --> 01:13:51,756
That's horrible.

1360
01:13:51,859 --> 01:13:53,019
Yeah.

1361
01:13:53,127 --> 01:13:54,992
He's only got, like,
one week left to live.

1362
01:13:57,398 --> 01:13:58,626
That is...

1363
01:14:00,134 --> 01:14:01,567
perfect.

1364
01:14:01,669 --> 01:14:03,899
That's perfect.
He's the perfect guy for her.

1365
01:14:04,005 --> 01:14:04,903
What?

1366
01:14:05,006 --> 01:14:06,098
Yeah.
There's no harm, right?

1367
01:14:06,207 --> 01:14:07,902
He gets laid.
She falls in love.

1368
01:14:08,009 --> 01:14:09,135
He's dead within a week.

1369
01:14:09,243 --> 01:14:10,369
I swoop in, console her.

1370
01:14:10,478 --> 01:14:11,570
Bing-bang-boom,
everybody's happy.

1371
01:14:11,679 --> 01:14:12,703
Hey!

1372
01:14:12,813 --> 01:14:15,509
Why don't you club her
and have a wedding ceremony

1373
01:14:15,616 --> 01:14:16,412
while she's knocked unconscious?

1374
01:14:16,517 --> 01:14:17,779
That'd work!

1375
01:14:19,487 --> 01:14:21,717
What the hell
is wrong with you?

1376
01:14:21,822 --> 01:14:25,383
You have to let her go.

1377
01:14:25,493 --> 01:14:28,860
That's the one thing
I can't do.

1378
01:15:00,194 --> 01:15:02,162
- Next time I'll bring my suit.
- Yeah.

1379
01:15:02,263 --> 01:15:03,594
Oh, no.

1380
01:15:03,698 --> 01:15:05,461
Oh, no. That's not good.

1381
01:15:10,905 --> 01:15:11,963
No.

1382
01:15:12,073 --> 01:15:14,234
It's over.

1383
01:15:14,342 --> 01:15:15,673
That has to be George.

1384
01:15:15,776 --> 01:15:17,801
George.

1385
01:15:20,214 --> 01:15:21,841
Hey, George!

1386
01:15:21,949 --> 01:15:23,507
- What's up, George?
- What?

1387
01:15:23,618 --> 01:15:24,949
- How you doing, George?
- I'm not George.

1388
01:15:25,052 --> 01:15:26,485
You're going to stay
away from Cam, all right?

1389
01:15:26,587 --> 01:15:29,715
You're going to stay away
from Cam, you hear me?

1390
01:15:29,824 --> 01:15:32,452
- You're George!
- Charlie!

1391
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:34,027
- I'm not George!
- Cam!

1392
01:15:34,128 --> 01:15:35,288
What are you doing?

1393
01:15:35,396 --> 01:15:37,296
I just met George.
He's a real jerk.

1394
01:15:37,398 --> 01:15:38,797
You shouldn't like him.
I want to see you.

1395
01:15:38,899 --> 01:15:41,390
Stay away from me!
Stay away from me!

1396
01:15:41,502 --> 01:15:42,469
No!

1397
01:15:43,170 --> 01:15:45,570
Falling.

1398
01:15:47,274 --> 01:15:48,536
What is wrong with you?

1399
01:15:52,913 --> 01:15:54,005
I'm being bitten!

1400
01:15:54,115 --> 01:15:56,310
Does he have fish
in his pants?

1401
01:16:01,622 --> 01:16:04,716
Oh, those fuckers
are vicious.

1402
01:16:04,825 --> 01:16:06,224
Yeah? Well, they don't like it

1403
01:16:06,327 --> 01:16:07,954
when someone disturbs
their environment.

1404
01:16:08,062 --> 01:16:09,529
Time to go, buddy.

1405
01:16:09,630 --> 01:16:11,564
I know I've been acting crazy,
but there's a reasonable-

1406
01:16:11,666 --> 01:16:12,860
Let me guess, Charlie.

1407
01:16:12,967 --> 01:16:14,366
You believe
you're a lucky charm,

1408
01:16:14,468 --> 01:16:17,369
and you're afraid I'm going
to marry the next guy I date,

1409
01:16:17,471 --> 01:16:19,939
so you've been smothering me
and attacking my friends.

1410
01:16:20,041 --> 01:16:21,099
What about George, okay?

1411
01:16:21,208 --> 01:16:22,607
What about your date with George?

1412
01:16:22,710 --> 01:16:24,610
Wednesday night?
What big date with George?

1413
01:16:24,712 --> 01:16:26,407
George is my hairdresser!

1414
01:16:28,215 --> 01:16:30,843
Excuse me. I'm sorry.
I was eavesdropping.

1415
01:16:30,951 --> 01:16:32,851
Are you really
Charlie Logan the lucky charm?

1416
01:16:32,953 --> 01:16:35,547
Because... I was wondering-

1417
01:16:35,656 --> 01:16:37,749
I can't. I'm sorry.
Cam, listen. Cam-

1418
01:16:37,858 --> 01:16:39,758
- No. Charlie, I just don't think we can
do this anymore.

1419
01:16:39,860 --> 01:16:40,690
- Don't say it!

1420
01:16:40,795 --> 01:16:42,092
- It's not working.
- Please, Cam.

1421
01:16:42,196 --> 01:16:44,255
Please, just don't say it's over.

1422
01:16:46,434 --> 01:16:47,526
It's over.

1423
01:17:16,530 --> 01:17:17,428
Dr. Charlie?

1424
01:17:17,531 --> 01:17:19,431
Hi, Reba.

1425
01:17:19,533 --> 01:17:21,467
I've been
calling you all day.

1426
01:17:21,569 --> 01:17:22,661
Where have you been?

1427
01:17:22,770 --> 01:17:24,635
Decided to take
another day off.

1428
01:17:24,739 --> 01:17:27,674
Hey, does our building
have roof access?

1429
01:17:27,775 --> 01:17:30,972
Oh, things can't be that bad.

1430
01:17:31,078 --> 01:17:34,309
You know, I owe you a thank-you.

1431
01:17:34,415 --> 01:17:37,213
I met a guy, and he's wonderful.

1432
01:17:37,318 --> 01:17:38,945
I really think he's the one.

1433
01:17:39,053 --> 01:17:43,046
That's great.
I'm happy for you.

1434
01:17:44,425 --> 01:17:47,792
You've done a good thing,
Dr. Charlie.

1435
01:17:47,895 --> 01:17:51,194
Helping people find love.

1436
01:17:51,298 --> 01:17:52,526
It's great.

1437
01:17:55,736 --> 01:17:57,795
I bet you didn't think
you'd be responsible

1438
01:17:57,905 --> 01:17:59,566
for helping me
find true love again,

1439
01:17:59,673 --> 01:18:00,833
but you did.

1440
01:18:00,941 --> 01:18:02,704
You did, Dr. Charlie.

1441
01:18:13,521 --> 01:18:15,386
Dr. Charlie, are you all right?

1442
01:18:15,489 --> 01:18:18,424
Love fall like rain.
I'm in pain.

1443
01:18:18,526 --> 01:18:20,016
She was right, Reba.

1444
01:18:20,127 --> 01:18:21,116
It's raining.

1445
01:18:21,228 --> 01:18:23,059
Oh, my God!

1446
01:18:27,034 --> 01:18:28,797
Stu, I need
to Google something.

1447
01:18:28,903 --> 01:18:30,029
Unacceptable!

1448
01:18:30,137 --> 01:18:31,365
Hey!

1449
01:18:31,472 --> 01:18:32,632
I wish I hadn't seen that!

1450
01:18:32,740 --> 01:18:34,674
A man can't masturbate
in his own house?

1451
01:18:34,775 --> 01:18:36,140
That is disgusting.

1452
01:18:36,243 --> 01:18:37,471
It's a known fact

1453
01:18:37,578 --> 01:18:39,136
that stimulation
of the prostate-

1454
01:18:39,246 --> 01:18:41,578
No, no, no, no.
Just get dressed

1455
01:18:41,682 --> 01:18:43,206
and wash your hands!

1456
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:48,013
All I know is that I'm hexed.

1457
01:18:48,122 --> 01:18:50,613
Yeah. If by hexed
you mean bat-shit crazy,

1458
01:18:50,724 --> 01:18:51,884
then yeah,
you're hexed, man.

1459
01:18:51,992 --> 01:18:53,050
Don't you remember?

1460
01:18:53,160 --> 01:18:54,491
Black lipstick,
long fingernails. A total freak.

1461
01:18:54,595 --> 01:18:56,222
She wanted me
to show her my penis.

1462
01:18:56,330 --> 01:18:57,991
I wouldn't,
so she pulled my nipples

1463
01:18:58,098 --> 01:18:59,497
and put a hex on me.

1464
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:02,330
Stu, I've lost the most
special person of my life.

1465
01:19:02,436 --> 01:19:04,461
I have to break this spell.

1466
01:19:04,572 --> 01:19:06,767
You haven't lost me, dude.

1467
01:19:06,874 --> 01:19:08,034
I'm here for you always.

1468
01:19:08,142 --> 01:19:09,837
Just drive the fucking car.

1469
01:19:13,747 --> 01:19:15,977
Oh, I'm so sorry, buddy.

1470
01:19:20,154 --> 01:19:22,384
Hey, what's up with Chester?

1471
01:19:22,489 --> 01:19:24,389
His girlfriend Molly's sick.

1472
01:19:24,491 --> 01:19:26,482
I sent her away for treatment.

1473
01:19:26,594 --> 01:19:28,255
He stopped grooming himself.

1474
01:19:30,965 --> 01:19:32,557
It's heartbreaking, you know?

1475
01:19:32,666 --> 01:19:34,065
If she doesn't come back,

1476
01:19:34,168 --> 01:19:36,602
he may never find another mate.

1477
01:19:42,276 --> 01:19:46,269
Murphy, maybe
you reacted too harshly.

1478
01:19:46,380 --> 01:19:48,211
You should call him.

1479
01:19:48,315 --> 01:19:49,543
I can't, Joe.

1480
01:19:49,650 --> 01:19:51,641
You saw him.
He's crazy.

1481
01:19:51,752 --> 01:19:54,653
Love does that
to you sometimes.

1482
01:19:54,755 --> 01:19:56,916
I don't want another one
of your philosophy lessons, Joe.

1483
01:19:57,024 --> 01:19:58,958
He was smothering me.

1484
01:19:59,059 --> 01:20:01,220
I want to be part of someone's life,

1485
01:20:01,328 --> 01:20:02,488
not all of it.

1486
01:20:02,596 --> 01:20:06,930
Have you taken a look
at your bedroom lately?

1487
01:20:07,034 --> 01:20:08,524
If you love something,

1488
01:20:08,636 --> 01:20:12,094
sometimes you just want
to be surrounded by it.

1489
01:20:19,747 --> 01:20:21,442
That's it. That's it.

1490
01:20:25,352 --> 01:20:27,843
How can I get her
to break the spell?

1491
01:20:27,955 --> 01:20:30,423
I don't know. She wanted to look
at your penis, right?

1492
01:20:30,524 --> 01:20:31,991
That was a joke.

1493
01:20:32,092 --> 01:20:33,320
Chuck?

1494
01:20:35,029 --> 01:20:36,257
Chuck, that was a joke.

1495
01:20:37,298 --> 01:20:38,287
Oh, my God.

1496
01:20:44,705 --> 01:20:46,935
Hi. Is your mother home?

1497
01:20:48,676 --> 01:20:51,338
Is your mother's name Anisha?

1498
01:20:51,445 --> 01:20:53,743
What's with the 50 questions?

1499
01:20:53,847 --> 01:20:55,246
That was two questions.

1500
01:20:55,349 --> 01:20:56,611
It's a hyperbole.

1501
01:20:56,717 --> 01:20:58,241
Sweetheart, who is it?

1502
01:21:00,187 --> 01:21:03,953
Are you Anisha Carpenter?

1503
01:21:04,058 --> 01:21:05,992
Do I know you?

1504
01:21:07,494 --> 01:21:09,189
Charlie Logan.

1505
01:21:10,464 --> 01:21:13,126
Look, I know this is
going to sound crazy,

1506
01:21:13,233 --> 01:21:15,861
but you put a hex on me

1507
01:21:15,970 --> 01:21:17,130
so that all my girlfriends

1508
01:21:17,237 --> 01:21:19,068
would fall in love
with other people,

1509
01:21:19,173 --> 01:21:20,800
and I need you...

1510
01:21:20,908 --> 01:21:22,432
to reverse the spell?

1511
01:21:26,680 --> 01:21:27,840
Woo! That-
That's your pendant.

1512
01:21:27,948 --> 01:21:29,313
You used to wear that!

1513
01:21:29,416 --> 01:21:32,317
You wore it at the party
when you pulled out my hair

1514
01:21:32,419 --> 01:21:34,011
and did the- with the thing.

1515
01:21:34,121 --> 01:21:35,486
And then you wanted
to see my penis,

1516
01:21:35,589 --> 01:21:36,613
and I said no.

1517
01:21:36,724 --> 01:21:38,624
Go to your room, Lila.
Lock the door.

1518
01:21:38,726 --> 01:21:40,125
But this is just getting good.

1519
01:21:40,227 --> 01:21:41,194
Now.

1520
01:21:42,730 --> 01:21:44,823
I'm sorry.

1521
01:21:44,932 --> 01:21:49,369
What can I do to convince you
to help me?

1522
01:22:07,554 --> 01:22:11,251
This spell-
turn it off, please.

1523
01:22:11,358 --> 01:22:12,757
Charlie, I was just a kid.

1524
01:22:12,860 --> 01:22:14,191
I didn't know
what I was doing.

1525
01:22:14,294 --> 01:22:15,591
I don't even know
what I did.

1526
01:22:15,696 --> 01:22:17,163
You fucked up my life!

1527
01:22:17,264 --> 01:22:18,356
That's what you did.

1528
01:22:18,465 --> 01:22:20,126
I asked you
to watch your language.

1529
01:22:20,234 --> 01:22:22,532
Your room. Now.

1530
01:22:25,439 --> 01:22:30,502
Anisha, I am begging you.

1531
01:22:30,611 --> 01:22:32,909
Have you ever wanted
someone so badly

1532
01:22:33,013 --> 01:22:35,174
that you would do anything
to get them?

1533
01:22:36,984 --> 01:22:39,418
If someone's
meant to be yours,

1534
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:42,080
eventually they will be.

1535
01:22:46,193 --> 01:22:48,127
No.
Wait. No!

1536
01:22:48,228 --> 01:22:50,059
If you think
that by me being here,

1537
01:22:50,164 --> 01:22:51,290
we're supposed
to get together-

1538
01:22:51,398 --> 01:22:54,367
I wasn't talking about you.

1539
01:22:55,969 --> 01:22:57,698
My husband Kurt.

1540
01:22:57,805 --> 01:23:00,399
Really, Charlie, I was 10.

1541
01:23:00,507 --> 01:23:02,407
I may have thought
I was in love,

1542
01:23:02,509 --> 01:23:04,443
but I was also hot
for Scott Baio.

1543
01:23:05,946 --> 01:23:07,345
So-

1544
01:23:13,153 --> 01:23:15,986
I've blown it.

1545
01:23:17,024 --> 01:23:20,391
Well, then,
all you can do is let her go.

1546
01:23:31,438 --> 01:23:32,564
Yeah, dude!

1547
01:23:32,673 --> 01:23:34,334
You're my hero!

1548
01:23:36,777 --> 01:23:39,371
How was she?

1549
01:23:39,480 --> 01:23:40,504
Take me home.

1550
01:23:40,614 --> 01:23:43,412
I'm not that easy, man.

1551
01:23:43,517 --> 01:23:46,509
You're going to have to
take me to dinner first.

1552
01:23:46,620 --> 01:23:48,781
You little munchkin.

1553
01:23:48,889 --> 01:23:50,550
I have to set her free,

1554
01:23:50,657 --> 01:23:52,716
let Mother Nature
take its course.

1555
01:23:52,826 --> 01:23:54,691
If you love something,
set it free, right?

1556
01:23:56,463 --> 01:23:58,556
I think Cam is really
going to respond

1557
01:23:58,665 --> 01:23:59,927
to the new gay you,
Chuck.

1558
01:24:00,033 --> 01:24:02,126
Take me home.

1559
01:24:02,236 --> 01:24:03,863
I got a phone call to make.

1560
01:24:16,016 --> 01:24:18,917
Hi. I'm trying to find
Howard Blaine.

1561
01:24:19,019 --> 01:24:20,281
Hi, Howard.

1562
01:24:20,387 --> 01:24:22,014
Um, we've never met,

1563
01:24:22,122 --> 01:24:26,491
but I have a friend
that you really need to meet.

1564
01:24:32,766 --> 01:24:33,926
Howard?

1565
01:25:51,411 --> 01:25:53,038
Eat me.

1566
01:25:53,146 --> 01:25:54,636
Eat me.

1567
01:25:54,748 --> 01:25:56,147
Gotcha.

1568
01:25:58,552 --> 01:25:59,746
Owned.

1569
01:26:00,787 --> 01:26:02,755
Owned.

1570
01:26:02,856 --> 01:26:04,551
I'm getting married!

1571
01:26:05,726 --> 01:26:08,286
Chuck! I found my dream girl,

1572
01:26:08,395 --> 01:26:11,330
and it's all because
of you I just proposed.

1573
01:26:11,431 --> 01:26:13,296
Lara, get your sweet ass
over here.

1574
01:26:13,400 --> 01:26:14,628
You remember Lara?

1575
01:26:16,637 --> 01:26:18,730
Lara stepped out of heaven-

1576
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:23,241
and into my office
to correct a condition.

1577
01:26:23,343 --> 01:26:24,503
She's got polymastia.

1578
01:26:25,712 --> 01:26:27,509
Has more than two boobs.

1579
01:26:27,614 --> 01:26:29,775
Isn't that perfect for me?
Show him.

1580
01:26:29,883 --> 01:26:30,781
No, no.

1581
01:26:30,884 --> 01:26:32,181
No, no, that's okay.

1582
01:26:32,286 --> 01:26:33,514
Really. I don't mind.

1583
01:26:33,620 --> 01:26:35,850
Yeah, I used to be
embarrassed about it,

1584
01:26:35,956 --> 01:26:37,753
but that was before
pookie pants here

1585
01:26:37,858 --> 01:26:40,019
made me realize
how special I am.

1586
01:26:40,127 --> 01:26:41,287
Oh, baby,
you're so goddamn special.

1587
01:26:41,395 --> 01:26:43,192
Oh, I love you, monkey pie.

1588
01:26:43,297 --> 01:26:44,730
- Okay, show him.
- Okay.

1589
01:26:47,801 --> 01:26:49,359
Is that or is that not

1590
01:26:49,469 --> 01:26:51,664
the most beautiful sight
you've ever seen in your life?

1591
01:26:51,772 --> 01:26:54,935
It's like seeing
the Grand Canyon for the first time.

1592
01:26:55,042 --> 01:26:57,602
It's like seeing Earth
from space.

1593
01:26:57,711 --> 01:26:59,440
<i>Like Three's Company,</i>

1594
01:26:59,546 --> 01:27:01,446
but all Chrissies,
you know what I'm saying?

1595
01:27:01,548 --> 01:27:02,674
I'm happy for you, buddy.

1596
01:27:03,950 --> 01:27:06,817
But, dude, that's not
why we came, okay?

1597
01:27:06,920 --> 01:27:10,321
Did you know that it smells
like shit in here?

1598
01:27:10,424 --> 01:27:12,255
You may want to open a window.

1599
01:27:12,359 --> 01:27:13,758
It's making me a little-

1600
01:27:13,860 --> 01:27:15,020
Okay, you tell him, baby.

1601
01:27:15,128 --> 01:27:17,722
Okay, so I'm friends with Katie,
who knows Cam,

1602
01:27:17,831 --> 01:27:19,890
and she said that Cam
said she's leaving today

1603
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,594
for Antarctica
with some penguin guru.

1604
01:27:26,039 --> 01:27:29,008
That's nice.
I'm happy for her.

1605
01:27:32,346 --> 01:27:34,906
You sure as shit
don't look happy.

1606
01:27:35,015 --> 01:27:38,178
I loved something,
and I set her free.

1607
01:27:38,285 --> 01:27:39,912
She met somebody else.

1608
01:27:40,020 --> 01:27:43,080
But I set her free.
That's what's important.

1609
01:27:49,529 --> 01:27:51,554
She's leaving, buddy...

1610
01:27:52,966 --> 01:27:54,263
for Antarctica...

1611
01:27:55,535 --> 01:27:57,025
right now.

1612
01:27:57,137 --> 01:28:01,233
She is going.

1613
01:28:01,341 --> 01:28:05,437
She's going.

1614
01:28:05,545 --> 01:28:10,881
She's... leaving.

1615
01:28:10,984 --> 01:28:12,315
What the fuck am I doing?

1616
01:28:12,419 --> 01:28:13,579
That's what we're saying!

1617
01:28:13,687 --> 01:28:16,383
Go!
Go get your girl, will you?

1618
01:28:16,490 --> 01:28:17,479
He's a little slow.

1619
01:28:49,022 --> 01:28:51,456
Excuse me.
I'm sorry, guys.

1620
01:28:51,558 --> 01:28:52,752
Ma'am, excuse me.

1621
01:28:55,395 --> 01:28:58,523
Has the flight for
Antarctica boarded yet?

1622
01:28:58,632 --> 01:29:00,725
There are no direct flights, sir.

1623
01:29:00,834 --> 01:29:01,892
Connecting flight?

1624
01:29:02,002 --> 01:29:03,970
Which one?
There are two.

1625
01:29:04,070 --> 01:29:05,162
Has the flight

1626
01:29:05,272 --> 01:29:07,866
with a passenger
named Cam Wexler boarded yet?

1627
01:29:07,974 --> 01:29:11,205
Sorry, sir.
Can't give you that information.

1628
01:29:11,311 --> 01:29:13,745
Sir, you won't be able to go
to the gate without a ticket.

1629
01:29:13,847 --> 01:29:16,338
I have to get
to Antarctica,

1630
01:29:16,450 --> 01:29:19,544
so I will take a ticket
for both planes.

1631
01:29:19,653 --> 01:29:23,248
There are only first class
tickets available, sir.

1632
01:29:23,356 --> 01:29:26,553
Of course there are.
I'll take them both.

1633
01:29:28,128 --> 01:29:30,119
Are you traveling
with any baggage?

1634
01:29:30,230 --> 01:29:31,356
No.

1635
01:29:31,465 --> 01:29:33,160
No.

1636
01:29:33,266 --> 01:29:35,700
You do realize
that it's -60 degrees there.

1637
01:29:35,802 --> 01:29:36,826
Yes.

1638
01:29:39,272 --> 01:29:41,706
And that'll be $17,412.

1639
01:29:48,582 --> 01:29:49,571
Just do it.

1640
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:55,046
Here you go.

1641
01:30:03,697 --> 01:30:06,131
Shoes, belt, watch.

1642
01:30:06,233 --> 01:30:08,167
You've never been
to an airport, dummy?

1643
01:30:15,575 --> 01:30:16,872
What goes in pockets?

1644
01:30:16,977 --> 01:30:18,103
Change.

1645
01:30:18,211 --> 01:30:20,179
Change.
Change goes in pockets.

1646
01:30:20,280 --> 01:30:21,304
Put it in the little bucket.

1647
01:30:21,414 --> 01:30:22,813
Don't waste
my big bucket.

1648
01:30:22,916 --> 01:30:24,474
No.
Small bucket!

1649
01:30:24,584 --> 01:30:25,881
I don't need it.

1650
01:30:25,986 --> 01:30:27,044
Want to make this quick?

1651
01:30:27,153 --> 01:30:28,552
I am in a real hurry.

1652
01:30:28,655 --> 01:30:30,020
Let's do this.
Take your pants off.

1653
01:30:30,123 --> 01:30:31,488
What?

1654
01:30:31,591 --> 01:30:33,684
You heard me.
Take your pants off.

1655
01:30:35,729 --> 01:30:37,788
I'm kidding you, weirdo.
Don't do that.

1656
01:30:37,898 --> 01:30:39,331
Why would you do that?

1657
01:30:39,432 --> 01:30:40,729
Come on, let's go.

1658
01:30:42,636 --> 01:30:45,070
Go, go, go.

1659
01:31:06,326 --> 01:31:07,293
Cam.

1660
01:31:08,628 --> 01:31:10,721
Wait!
One more! Here.

1661
01:31:18,505 --> 01:31:19,597
I meant to do that.

1662
01:31:30,784 --> 01:31:31,682
Here.

1663
01:31:31,785 --> 01:31:32,752
Thanks.

1664
01:31:34,521 --> 01:31:35,510
Charlie?

1665
01:31:35,622 --> 01:31:37,886
I'm sorry.
Please don't be mad.

1666
01:31:37,991 --> 01:31:40,789
Antarctica? You couldn't have
just taken her to a movie?

1667
01:31:40,894 --> 01:31:42,020
Charlie-

1668
01:31:42,128 --> 01:31:44,289
Look, I know that it's
crazy that I'm here,

1669
01:31:44,397 --> 01:31:46,991
but it felt even crazier
not to come.

1670
01:31:47,100 --> 01:31:49,534
Excuse me.
You have to take your seats.

1671
01:31:49,636 --> 01:31:50,534
Charlie-

1672
01:31:50,637 --> 01:31:51,729
My entire life,

1673
01:31:51,838 --> 01:31:53,499
I've been nothing more
than a stepping-stone

1674
01:31:53,607 --> 01:31:55,336
to every relationship
I've ever been in.

1675
01:31:55,442 --> 01:31:58,434
There's always been a next guy
who's better than me.

1676
01:31:58,545 --> 01:32:02,413
For once in my life,
I want to be that next guy.

1677
01:32:05,552 --> 01:32:09,454
I've never said this
to anybody in my whole life.

1678
01:32:09,556 --> 01:32:10,545
Cam...

1679
01:32:14,260 --> 01:32:16,455
I love you.

1680
01:32:16,563 --> 01:32:17,996
I love you, Cam.

1681
01:32:20,533 --> 01:32:23,127
Please don't go.

1682
01:32:24,638 --> 01:32:28,130
Charlie, I'm coming back
on Wednesday.

1683
01:32:28,241 --> 01:32:29,606
What?

1684
01:32:29,709 --> 01:32:30,607
Yeah.

1685
01:32:30,710 --> 01:32:31,870
But Howard and-

1686
01:32:31,978 --> 01:32:35,311
Have you met
Howard's wife Marilyn?

1687
01:32:35,415 --> 01:32:37,747
Howard's wife?

1688
01:32:37,851 --> 01:32:39,341
Howard's wife.

1689
01:32:39,452 --> 01:32:40,419
Hi.

1690
01:32:40,520 --> 01:32:41,919
Hi, Howard's wife.

1691
01:32:42,022 --> 01:32:43,011
Howard's wife.

1692
01:32:43,123 --> 01:32:45,683
I know about your call
to Howard.

1693
01:32:45,792 --> 01:32:47,453
I knew you wanted to meet him.

1694
01:32:47,560 --> 01:32:49,460
I knew it would make you happy.

1695
01:32:49,562 --> 01:32:51,757
I swear that's all
I've ever wanted to do.

1696
01:32:51,865 --> 01:32:54,629
Plus, mate selection
is up to the female.

1697
01:32:56,703 --> 01:32:58,796
But, Charlie,
you've been acting so-

1698
01:32:58,905 --> 01:33:00,566
I know, I know.
Idiotic, nuts.

1699
01:33:00,674 --> 01:33:02,665
And no more lucky charm excuse.

1700
01:33:02,776 --> 01:33:06,041
I'm done thinking
about the past and what could be.

1701
01:33:06,146 --> 01:33:09,047
All I care about now is what is.

1702
01:33:09,149 --> 01:33:11,515
And this-

1703
01:33:11,618 --> 01:33:13,848
This is.

1704
01:33:16,856 --> 01:33:18,551
Ladies and gentlemen,

1705
01:33:18,658 --> 01:33:20,353
we are about to close
the cabin doors.

1706
01:33:20,460 --> 01:33:21,552
Please take your seats.

1707
01:33:24,631 --> 01:33:25,723
That's for you.

1708
01:33:25,832 --> 01:33:27,390
Here.

1709
01:33:47,721 --> 01:33:48,779
Charlie!

1710
01:33:58,631 --> 01:34:00,292
Excuse me, are you that guy who-

1711
01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:01,560
He isn't anymore.

1712
01:35:01,694 --> 01:35:02,888
Excuse me.

1713
01:35:17,744 --> 01:35:20,645
Giggle monkey,
what are you looking for?

1714
01:35:20,747 --> 01:35:22,044
Sex tapes.

1715
01:35:22,148 --> 01:35:25,777
What is the point in house sitting
if you can't scope out

1716
01:35:25,885 --> 01:35:28,945
some good old-fashioned
homemade porn!

1717
01:35:29,055 --> 01:35:31,353
- Score!
- You're a genius.

1718
01:35:33,493 --> 01:35:34,517
Okay.

1719
01:35:34,627 --> 01:35:35,594
Hold on.

1720
01:35:43,469 --> 01:35:45,369
Do it. Do it. Oh, yeah.

1721
01:35:45,471 --> 01:35:46,369
Babe.

1722
01:35:46,472 --> 01:35:48,030
Yeah, what?

1723
01:35:48,141 --> 01:35:49,199
Oh, you like that.

1724
01:35:49,309 --> 01:35:51,209
You like when I do
stuff with the-

1725
01:35:51,311 --> 01:35:53,711
All right. I'll do it
for just one last time.

1726
01:35:53,813 --> 01:35:54,711
This is it.

1727
01:35:54,814 --> 01:35:55,906
Okay.

1728
01:35:56,015 --> 01:35:57,073
Because I'm not
into bestiality,

1729
01:35:57,183 --> 01:35:58,514
and you know that.
That's documented.

1730
01:35:58,618 --> 01:36:00,108
No, I know. It's fake.

1731
01:36:00,220 --> 01:36:01,118
All right.

1732
01:36:01,221 --> 01:36:02,119
But it's hot.

1733
01:36:02,222 --> 01:36:03,120
Okay.

1734
01:36:03,223 --> 01:36:05,589
Hey. So, uh...

1735
01:36:05,692 --> 01:36:06,886
so do you want to-

1736
01:36:06,993 --> 01:36:08,460
You come to this
glacier often?

1737
01:36:09,729 --> 01:36:13,221
I'm really interested in you
because you're a Gentoo soul.

1738
01:36:14,400 --> 01:36:15,731
You like that?

1739
01:36:15,835 --> 01:36:18,133
Yeah, I like that.
Do it faster.

1740
01:36:18,238 --> 01:36:20,331
You like... when I do that?

1741
01:36:21,608 --> 01:36:23,508
You ever seen me
go down on a-

1742
01:36:23,610 --> 01:36:24,770
Shh. It's okay. No, no.

1743
01:36:24,878 --> 01:36:26,243
Baby, baby, don't worry.

1744
01:36:28,281 --> 01:36:29,578
Yeah, I like that.

1745
01:36:35,388 --> 01:36:36,548
You like that, don't you?

1746
01:36:36,656 --> 01:36:37,554
Yeah.

1747
01:36:37,657 --> 01:36:38,681
Oh, that's so hot.

1748
01:36:38,791 --> 01:36:40,986
Shh. No more "Uhh. "
No more "Uhh. "

1749
01:36:43,997 --> 01:36:45,760
Do it. Yeah.

1750
01:36:45,865 --> 01:36:46,763
Oh, yeah.

1751
01:36:47,867 --> 01:36:50,893
That's really good.

1752
01:36:51,004 --> 01:36:52,403
Okay, now do the other thing.

1753
01:36:52,505 --> 01:36:53,631
Do the other thing.

1754
01:36:56,809 --> 01:36:58,868
Look at me. Here's
really what you like.

1755
01:36:58,978 --> 01:37:00,741
Yeah, you know what I like.

1756
01:37:00,847 --> 01:37:04,374
Oh, yeah. Oh, I'm really
getting in the mood now.

1757
01:37:04,484 --> 01:37:06,384
You like when I eat
your penguin ass?

1758
01:37:06,486 --> 01:37:08,784
Yeah. Baby,
I think I'm ready.

1759
01:37:10,156 --> 01:37:13,683
Turn it off, baby.

1760
01:37:15,395 --> 01:37:16,555
You still in the mood?

1761
01:37:16,663 --> 01:37:17,561
Yeah.

1762
01:37:17,664 --> 01:37:18,562
All right.

1763
01:41:09,962 --> 01:41:12,931
