1
00:01:50,213 --> 00:01:52,488
The essence of life isn't comic.

2
00:01:52,573 --> 00:01:54,450
lt's tragic.

3
00:01:54,533 --> 00:01:59,163
There's nothing intrinsically funny
about the terrible facts of human existence.

4
00:01:59,253 --> 00:02:04,771
l disagree. Philosophers call it absurd
because, in the end, all you can do is laugh.

5
00:02:04,853 --> 00:02:08,926
Human aspirations
are so ludicrous and irrational.

6
00:02:09,013 --> 00:02:12,767
l mean, if the underlying reality
of our being was tragic,

7
00:02:12,853 --> 00:02:15,413
my plays would make more than yours,

8
00:02:15,493 --> 00:02:19,452
because my stories would resonate
more profoundly with the human soul.

9
00:02:19,533 --> 00:02:25,369
l mean, it's exactly because tragedy
hits on the truly painful essence of life

10
00:02:25,453 --> 00:02:28,047
that people run to my comedies for escape.

11
00:02:28,133 --> 00:02:29,282
No, no.

12
00:02:29,373 --> 00:02:32,649
Tragedy confronts. Comedy escapes.

13
00:02:32,733 --> 00:02:35,327
Look, you guys,
what are we discussing here?

14
00:02:35,413 --> 00:02:41,329
ls there a deeper reality in comedy or
tragedy? Who can make such ajudgment?

15
00:02:41,413 --> 00:02:45,770
Look, let me tell you a story and you tell me,
is it material for a comedy or a tragedy?

16
00:02:45,853 --> 00:02:47,764
This happened to some people l know.

17
00:02:47,853 --> 00:02:51,641
lt's a small dinner party. The hosts
are trying to impress one of their guests.

18
00:02:51,733 --> 00:02:55,885
Suddenly the doorbell rings and out of
nowhere an unexpected person shows up.

19
00:02:55,973 --> 00:02:58,646
- A man or a woman?
- A woman. l'll give you the details

20
00:02:58,733 --> 00:03:01,122
and you tell me comedy or tragedy.

21
00:03:01,213 --> 00:03:05,206
So, the guest enters and
everyone is surprised, especially the host.

22
00:03:05,293 --> 00:03:08,012
Turns out she's got a particular problem...

23
00:03:08,093 --> 00:03:10,129
My God, that's quite amusing.

24
00:03:10,213 --> 00:03:13,922
l mean, she barges in unannounced
while they're eating.

25
00:03:14,013 --> 00:03:17,085
What you told us
would make a very good romantic comedy.

26
00:03:17,173 --> 00:03:21,291
- Because you see the world comically.
- You're missing the tragic implications.

27
00:03:21,373 --> 00:03:26,606
The entanglement it suggests.
No, l see the whole thing quite differently.

28
00:03:26,693 --> 00:03:29,127
l see this lone figure -

29
00:03:29,213 --> 00:03:32,330
a woman who's maybe just come off a bus.

30
00:03:32,413 --> 00:03:38,602
She's toting a suitcase. Maybe
she's searching nervously for an address.

31
00:04:02,133 --> 00:04:03,805
Hello?

32
00:04:03,893 --> 00:04:06,532
Who is it?

33
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:07,807
Hello?

34
00:04:08,013 --> 00:04:09,605
Hello?

35
00:04:10,853 --> 00:04:13,890
- Can l help you, miss?
- The Springers.

36
00:04:13,973 --> 00:04:15,964
Top floor.

37
00:04:33,893 --> 00:04:37,681
- lt's really good.
- These speakers are wonderful.

38
00:04:37,773 --> 00:04:40,571
You do pick up
every little nuance of the orchestra.

39
00:04:40,653 --> 00:04:43,247
Tell me again
why l can't have a glass of wine?

40
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:45,847
Every pregnancy,
she asks the same question.

41
00:04:45,933 --> 00:04:48,572
This is the ''Concerto in D''.

42
00:04:48,653 --> 00:04:51,486
Yes. My God,
you really know your Stravinsky.

43
00:04:51,573 --> 00:04:54,007
This would be good theme music for the play.

44
00:04:54,093 --> 00:04:56,448
- Lee?
- That's a brilliant idea.

45
00:04:56,533 --> 00:05:01,129
l need a little help with the final touches.

46
00:05:01,213 --> 00:05:05,604
- Can you get the two big serving dishes?
- l'm running out of obsequious banter.

47
00:05:05,693 --> 00:05:08,491
- How's it going?
- He thinks l'm perfect for the part.

48
00:05:08,573 --> 00:05:10,803
The goddamn producer
wants more of a name.

49
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:16,092
l don't understand why they make
such a big deal. lt's not like it's the lead.

50
00:05:16,173 --> 00:05:19,529
My first audition went better.
l don't know what happened.

51
00:05:19,613 --> 00:05:23,208
- And l know it's not the lead, Laurel.
- Doesn't he have any clout?

52
00:05:23,293 --> 00:05:27,525
They want a name. l'm not a name.
You didn't marry a name.

53
00:05:27,973 --> 00:05:31,443
- Sally said how much she loves your place.
- How long are you here?

54
00:05:31,533 --> 00:05:34,923
Six months, and we're still not finished.

55
00:05:35,013 --> 00:05:37,732
We have to furnish slowly
cos we used up all our money.

56
00:05:37,813 --> 00:05:41,692
We could not go on in that one-bedroom.
The piano ate up the living room.

57
00:05:41,773 --> 00:05:46,051
We're living beyond our means. l get nervous.
Laurel is certain God will provide.

58
00:05:46,133 --> 00:05:49,489
- They're poor, but happy.
- Definitely poor.

59
00:05:49,573 --> 00:05:52,610
- What do you do, Peter?
- l'm a lawyer. No jokes, please.

60
00:05:52,693 --> 00:05:55,127
Think the music's a little too loud?

61
00:05:55,213 --> 00:05:59,286
l saw you listening to the Mahler and crying.
You should have seen her.

62
00:05:59,373 --> 00:06:03,127
She was listening to Mahler
with tears streaming down her face.

63
00:06:03,213 --> 00:06:05,886
She looked so beautiful. l wanted to hug her.

64
00:06:05,973 --> 00:06:09,329
Yeah. But l had to get up early
and film a deodorant commercial.

65
00:06:09,413 --> 00:06:12,610
That's work at least, right?

66
00:06:12,693 --> 00:06:14,923
l think someone rang before. Did you hear?

67
00:06:15,013 --> 00:06:19,291
- So, how do you all know each other?
- We grew up together, Cassie and l.

68
00:06:19,373 --> 00:06:23,161
We were those little girls at school
with the plaid skirts.

69
00:06:23,253 --> 00:06:27,724
- And Lee and l met at Northwestern.
- He was the star actor, the handsome athlete.

70
00:06:27,813 --> 00:06:31,283
Everybody wanted him. But Laurel got him.

71
00:06:34,773 --> 00:06:36,491
- Melinda?
- Hi.

72
00:06:36,573 --> 00:06:38,564
Melinda?

73
00:06:39,133 --> 00:06:41,886
- Hi, Melinda, hi.
- My goodness.

74
00:06:41,973 --> 00:06:43,770
God.

75
00:06:43,853 --> 00:06:45,252
Cassie.

76
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:47,528
l'm stunned.

77
00:06:47,613 --> 00:06:49,569
Here, let me take these.

78
00:06:49,653 --> 00:06:52,087
God, look at you. You look so...

79
00:06:52,173 --> 00:06:55,131
No, don't. Don't say what you're thinking of.

80
00:06:55,213 --> 00:06:59,172
l've been on a bus.
l've been on a Greyhound bus since Tuesday,

81
00:06:59,253 --> 00:07:03,644
so l'm sure l look like
the wreck of the <i>Hesperus.</i>

82
00:07:03,733 --> 00:07:07,521
A bus from where?
l mean, what are you doing here?

83
00:07:07,613 --> 00:07:11,811
l've moved around.
l had to keep moving.

84
00:07:11,893 --> 00:07:14,407
Events unfolded

85
00:07:14,493 --> 00:07:17,883
in such a way that...

86
00:07:17,973 --> 00:07:20,248
ls it all right if l smoke?

87
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:25,327
l just feel a little nervous
barging in on you like this.

88
00:07:25,413 --> 00:07:29,008
Why don't you sit down and eat with us?
This is Jack and Sally Oliver.

89
00:07:29,093 --> 00:07:30,128
- Hi.
- Hi.

90
00:07:30,213 --> 00:07:32,249
l'm Melinda Robicheaux.

91
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:36,121
l've gone back to my mother's name.
lt's French. She was Parisienne.

92
00:07:36,213 --> 00:07:38,647
You must have dropped
off the goddamn moon.

93
00:07:38,733 --> 00:07:41,805
- Shall l get a chair?
- l could use a drink.

94
00:07:41,893 --> 00:07:44,123
Champagne or white wine.

95
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:49,526
The truth is,
l've gotten very used to single malt Scotch.

96
00:07:49,613 --> 00:07:53,049
An acquaintance of mine
introduced me to it, so...

97
00:07:53,133 --> 00:07:56,330
l really should freshen up, though.

98
00:07:56,413 --> 00:08:00,008
lf l could just get a single malt Scotch, and...

99
00:08:00,093 --> 00:08:02,926
Look at me. Jesus. l need a hot shower.

100
00:08:03,013 --> 00:08:05,083
Yeah. OK, please...

101
00:08:05,173 --> 00:08:07,767
Excuse us. Please start.

102
00:08:07,853 --> 00:08:10,048
This is so unexpected.

103
00:08:12,053 --> 00:08:14,123
l'll say.

104
00:08:14,213 --> 00:08:18,365
- You had no hint she was coming?
- She was nuts then, and she's nuts now.

105
00:08:18,453 --> 00:08:21,525
- Did you see the look in her eyes?
- She's been on a bus.

106
00:08:21,613 --> 00:08:23,683
You were asking how we know each other.

107
00:08:23,773 --> 00:08:26,890
Melinda is the third musketeer.
We went to school together.

108
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:31,046
- We haven't heard from her in ages.
- Yeah. She's had personal difficulties.

109
00:08:31,133 --> 00:08:35,524
She said she'd be coming to New York from...
l can't remember, Chicago or lndiana,

110
00:08:35,613 --> 00:08:39,765
and could we put her up?
Laurel said, ''Sure.'' l myself...

111
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:44,165
This is not the time to discuss this.
Let's just eat and change the subject.

112
00:08:44,253 --> 00:08:49,008
Well, what can you do? We've all had friends
drop in unannounced. Remember your aunt?

113
00:08:49,093 --> 00:08:53,962
l put up an extra bed. l fix up the room for her.
She doesn't show when she says she will.

114
00:08:54,053 --> 00:08:57,807
So we try to contact her
and there's no trace of her.

115
00:08:57,893 --> 00:09:03,365
Two months later, she calls up unannounced
in the middle of a frigging dinner party.

116
00:09:03,453 --> 00:09:06,684
- Am l unreasonable?
- No, no!

117
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:13,088
You're missing the whole point. You have the
makings of a delightful human comedy here.

118
00:09:13,173 --> 00:09:15,607
You missed the humour in everything.

119
00:09:15,693 --> 00:09:20,084
l see a sweet, tree-lined block
on the Upper East Side.

120
00:09:20,173 --> 00:09:25,645
lt's a dinner party. The husband is fawning
over his guest. He's a moviemaker.

121
00:09:25,733 --> 00:09:28,122
No, wait.

122
00:09:28,213 --> 00:09:34,686
Here's the idea. Make the film director the
wife. He's just her out-of-work actor husband.

123
00:09:34,773 --> 00:09:39,164
She's trying to impress the guest
and raise the money for an independent film.

124
00:09:39,253 --> 00:09:43,485
l just told Jennifer that Steve is interested
in investing in Susan's next movie.

125
00:09:43,573 --> 00:09:48,442
Yeah. l have most of the money. l've just
been trying to get it going now for two years.

126
00:09:48,533 --> 00:09:51,730
l liked your first picture.
Would you do this one on video too?

127
00:09:51,813 --> 00:09:55,089
No. That was just because
we only had $300,000.

128
00:09:55,173 --> 00:09:58,848
- This one will be on 35mm for sure.
- Well, how much do you need?

129
00:09:58,933 --> 00:10:02,369
l've raised about four million
and we need another two million.

130
00:10:02,453 --> 00:10:04,842
The problem is the theme is controversial.

131
00:10:04,933 --> 00:10:07,811
- What's the theme?
- Well, let's put it this way.

132
00:10:07,893 --> 00:10:13,968
lt's a mostly all-female cast
and it's called <i>The Castration Sonata.</i>

133
00:10:14,053 --> 00:10:17,648
- Do you happen to have single malt Scotch?
- You know, let me check.

134
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:23,088
- Hurry. l'm running out of obsequious banter.
- Don't throw me. Everything's timed.

135
00:10:23,173 --> 00:10:26,643
Chilean sea bass and caramelised filo
is not like scrambled eggs.

136
00:10:26,733 --> 00:10:31,602
Well, he happens to love it. Does he love it
$2 million worth? God, l hope so.

137
00:10:31,693 --> 00:10:33,843
l told you we should keep single malt Scotch.

138
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:35,651
- Who drinks it?
- He does.

139
00:10:35,733 --> 00:10:40,045
God, you're definitely going all out.
You're dressed very sexy.

140
00:10:40,133 --> 00:10:43,250
- Hobie, keep your eyes on the sea bass!
- OK, OK, OK.

141
00:10:43,813 --> 00:10:49,012
She goes down to buy
a bottle of single malt Scotch.

142
00:10:54,893 --> 00:10:56,884
Are you OK?

143
00:10:58,893 --> 00:11:01,248
Yeah, l'm fine.

144
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:03,563
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

145
00:11:07,813 --> 00:11:12,011
Here we go. These are
Coquilles St Jacques with cinnamon.

146
00:11:12,093 --> 00:11:17,451
And we're having sea bass in a caramelised
filo pastry, lightly dusted with lime powder.

147
00:11:17,533 --> 00:11:21,685
- Did someone send you a yuppie cookbook?
- Susan says you're a wonderful chef.

148
00:11:21,773 --> 00:11:24,492
l'm an out-of-work actor.

149
00:11:25,133 --> 00:11:27,124
Who's that?

150
00:11:28,413 --> 00:11:29,687
- Hi.
- Hi.

151
00:11:29,773 --> 00:11:32,162
l'm sorry. l hope l'm not intruding.

152
00:11:32,253 --> 00:11:34,608
No, it's OK.

153
00:11:36,533 --> 00:11:42,085
l've been having a kind of bad time
and l just took some sleeping pills.

154
00:11:42,173 --> 00:11:45,051
- Sleeping pills?
- How many?

155
00:11:45,133 --> 00:11:48,762
- 28.
- Whoa! Call 911.

156
00:11:48,853 --> 00:11:52,402
Stay and just eat. lt's gonna get cold.
Sit. Just stay and eat.

157
00:11:52,493 --> 00:11:54,051
lt's OK. lt's OK.

158
00:11:54,133 --> 00:11:56,727
- Hobie, make some black coffee.
- OK, OK.

159
00:11:56,813 --> 00:11:59,407
l'm allergic to coffee,
but do you have any vodka?

160
00:11:59,493 --> 00:12:02,132
- Vodka?
- Maybe we should call a doctor.

161
00:12:02,213 --> 00:12:05,205
lt's OK.
l just need something to calm my nerves.

162
00:12:05,293 --> 00:12:08,649
- Do you live in this building?
- l've been subletting for a month.

163
00:12:08,733 --> 00:12:11,372
- Somebody call a doctor.
- Careful.

164
00:12:11,453 --> 00:12:14,172
- l'm gonna be sick.
- That's the best thing.

165
00:12:14,253 --> 00:12:17,689
No, no, not on the carpet.
That's a new carpet. Go to the bathroom.

166
00:12:17,773 --> 00:12:20,492
l smell smoke. Can you smell smoke?

167
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:24,202
God! The Chilean sea bass
lightly dusted with lime!

168
00:12:25,413 --> 00:12:30,487
Should you be taking those pills?
You didn't have any dinner.

169
00:12:31,773 --> 00:12:34,207
lf l don't, l can't sleep.

170
00:12:34,293 --> 00:12:38,081
Well, Cassie's put on weight,
not that l'd ever say anything to her.

171
00:12:38,173 --> 00:12:41,643
- Cassie's pregnant.
- Again?

172
00:12:41,733 --> 00:12:44,645
They swear they're stopping at three children.

173
00:12:44,733 --> 00:12:47,293
For me, two was just the right number.

174
00:12:47,373 --> 00:12:52,049
- ls there any word?
- No, there's none. There's nothing.

175
00:12:53,533 --> 00:12:57,811
Now, l don't want you to get panicky,
but l am planning on staying. Just for a while.

176
00:12:57,893 --> 00:13:03,445
l just need to find a place
and settle in and rebuild my career.

177
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:06,445
And you did say that you had
enough room to put me up.

178
00:13:06,533 --> 00:13:09,969
We were surprised you never showed up.
We had everything ready.

179
00:13:10,053 --> 00:13:13,170
Lee had gotten your room in order.

180
00:13:13,253 --> 00:13:17,292
l apologise for that. l was going through
a kind of confused down period.

181
00:13:17,373 --> 00:13:21,366
l was worried. Lee couldn't figure out
how to get in contact with you.

182
00:13:21,453 --> 00:13:24,047
l'd no idea you were using different names.

183
00:13:24,133 --> 00:13:26,886
What happened?
l thought the worst was over.

184
00:13:27,893 --> 00:13:31,727
- Can l speak openly?
- Of course.

185
00:13:34,493 --> 00:13:37,087
l tried to commit suicide.

186
00:13:37,853 --> 00:13:40,287
You didn't.

187
00:13:40,373 --> 00:13:43,490
l did, and it wasn't a half-hearted attempt.

188
00:13:43,573 --> 00:13:45,882
lt wasn't a cry for help.

189
00:13:46,453 --> 00:13:51,447
Why? l thought everything that happened was
past. l thought you'd pulled yourself together.

190
00:13:51,533 --> 00:13:57,244
Because that's what l wrote you,
and some days l honestly thought it.

191
00:13:57,333 --> 00:14:02,248
But in the end,
l just couldn't take it any more.

192
00:14:02,693 --> 00:14:04,012
Melinda.

193
00:14:05,373 --> 00:14:09,048
You didn't find me because l was indisposed.

194
00:14:09,853 --> 00:14:15,246
lf you've never been in a state mental hospital
in a straitjacket, l wouldn't recommend one,

195
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:18,928
especially not the one l was in,
in the Midwest.

196
00:14:19,013 --> 00:14:21,129
l'm overwhelmed.

197
00:14:21,213 --> 00:14:23,522
Are you OK? l mean...

198
00:14:23,973 --> 00:14:26,487
l'm all right. l'm on the road back.

199
00:14:26,573 --> 00:14:30,407
l'm still a little fragile
when everything closes in,

200
00:14:30,493 --> 00:14:33,769
but l get stronger every day.

201
00:14:33,853 --> 00:14:37,004
You know you're welcome to stay here
as long as you like.

202
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:44,291
- There. How long is she gonna stay?
- Why?

203
00:14:44,373 --> 00:14:47,126
We promised my sister
could stay for Thanksgiving.

204
00:14:47,213 --> 00:14:50,728
- Well, Thanksgiving's not for a while.
- Well, l'm just saying.

205
00:14:50,813 --> 00:14:54,965
- She's trying to pull her life back together.
- She's her own worst enemy.

206
00:14:55,053 --> 00:14:58,204
- You don't know the details.
- Details? What details?

207
00:14:58,293 --> 00:15:01,012
She was married to some doctor.
She had two kids.

208
00:15:01,093 --> 00:15:04,051
What was she doing playing around with...
What was he?

209
00:15:04,133 --> 00:15:06,408
He was a photographer.

210
00:15:06,493 --> 00:15:07,687
Melinda.

211
00:15:07,773 --> 00:15:11,812
Lee's right. Whatever l went through,
l'm responsible for.

212
00:15:11,893 --> 00:15:15,647
Look, we've all been drinking
and we're really tired. lt's...

213
00:15:15,733 --> 00:15:18,042
No, he's right.

214
00:15:18,133 --> 00:15:22,809
l was married to a man who loved me
and gave me the two most beautiful children.

215
00:15:22,893 --> 00:15:26,772
That l'm not allowed
to set eyes on them is just proof

216
00:15:26,853 --> 00:15:29,731
of my weakness and my husband's strength.

217
00:15:29,813 --> 00:15:33,089
No. lt's disgusting how much influence
he had on the judge.

218
00:15:33,173 --> 00:15:35,733
lt's who you know. Life is all networking.

219
00:15:35,813 --> 00:15:40,443
l brought it on myself because l was bored.

220
00:15:41,413 --> 00:15:44,291
l mean, not bored with my children.

221
00:15:45,933 --> 00:15:48,401
God, they were the light of my life.

222
00:15:48,493 --> 00:15:52,088
But l was bored being a doctor's wife,

223
00:15:52,173 --> 00:15:55,529
just as my mother was bored
being a doctor's wife.

224
00:15:55,613 --> 00:16:01,404
Like Madame Bovary.
lt's not that St Louis isn't very beautiful.

225
00:16:01,493 --> 00:16:03,484
lt's just that

226
00:16:05,373 --> 00:16:11,767
everything that had seemed
so magical when l married Josh

227
00:16:11,853 --> 00:16:14,845
somehow just melted away.

228
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:17,811
lt was OK, you know?

229
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:22,887
And no matter what l did,
l couldn't make it any better.

230
00:16:25,133 --> 00:16:27,727
And then this

231
00:16:27,813 --> 00:16:30,771
man with a romantic name -

232
00:16:30,853 --> 00:16:34,243
John San Giuliano -

233
00:16:36,813 --> 00:16:39,008
took my photograph.

234
00:16:40,413 --> 00:16:44,406
And l fell in love with him,

235
00:16:44,493 --> 00:16:48,611
and we began having this love affair.

236
00:16:49,413 --> 00:16:53,122
And he wanted to know
if l could see myself living in ltaly,

237
00:16:53,213 --> 00:16:59,652
and l said, ''Well, look, Mr San Giuliano,
l'm married to a surgeon with two children.''

238
00:16:59,733 --> 00:17:02,884
''My life is fixed,
so don't ask me to tax my imagination.''

239
00:17:02,973 --> 00:17:09,765
''Let's just confine our passion to local motels
and forget Capistrano.''

240
00:17:13,453 --> 00:17:15,444
And then

241
00:17:16,533 --> 00:17:21,004
reality set in
in the person of a private detective

242
00:17:21,093 --> 00:17:24,483
with the unlikely name of Woodkrutch,

243
00:17:26,173 --> 00:17:28,368
and my children

244
00:17:28,453 --> 00:17:32,731
were handed over
to my humiliated husband forever.

245
00:17:35,573 --> 00:17:39,930
Mr San Giuliano

246
00:17:40,013 --> 00:17:44,609
took me on a safari to help me forget things.

247
00:17:44,693 --> 00:17:48,686
But l can't forget, no matter how hard l try.

248
00:17:49,493 --> 00:17:52,485
Then he met someone else.

249
00:17:52,933 --> 00:17:55,606
Stop, Melinda.

250
00:17:56,093 --> 00:17:58,891
Why? lt only gets worse.

251
00:18:01,293 --> 00:18:03,807
So that's pretty much how l got here.

252
00:18:03,893 --> 00:18:06,327
My God, that's a sad story.

253
00:18:06,413 --> 00:18:09,962
Guy leads her on, causes her to break up
her marriage, then dumps her.

254
00:18:10,053 --> 00:18:13,966
l caught him in bed with one of his models.
l mean, who can blame him?

255
00:18:14,053 --> 00:18:19,081
She was a 6ft Swede who was a Miss World
runner-up. Her legs started at her chin.

256
00:18:19,173 --> 00:18:24,088
See, that's why my film, <i>The Castration</i>
<i>Sonata</i>, puts male sexuality in perspective.

257
00:18:24,173 --> 00:18:29,566
lt's lucky you didn't have children.
He could have made custody trouble.

258
00:18:29,653 --> 00:18:33,248
l always wanted to have children,
but my husband wouldn't hear of it.

259
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:36,882
He couldn't bear having sex with
a pregnant woman for nine months,

260
00:18:36,973 --> 00:18:38,486
especially the fat months.

261
00:18:38,573 --> 00:18:42,248
- So, what are you gonna do now?
- l'm an art historian.

262
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:44,927
At least, that's what l majored in at Brandeis.

263
00:18:45,013 --> 00:18:48,403
And l may be getting offered
ajob in an art gallery.

264
00:18:48,493 --> 00:18:51,849
lt's only cataloguing,
but l'm in no position to turn it down.

265
00:18:51,933 --> 00:18:54,891
Anyone for more Ants Climb a Tree
before l throw it out?

266
00:18:54,973 --> 00:18:58,010
- l can't eat another bite.
- Dinner was delicious.

267
00:18:58,093 --> 00:19:01,290
Sorry about burning the sea bass
and the kitchen curtains.

268
00:19:01,373 --> 00:19:03,728
- l'm sorry about busting in on you.
- No, no.

269
00:19:03,813 --> 00:19:09,046
We love it when unexpected women
barge in and throw up. l'm kidding.

270
00:19:09,133 --> 00:19:12,409
l hope tonight didn't kill my chances
of getting my movie made.

271
00:19:12,493 --> 00:19:14,563
No, no. l think Steve Walsh was OK.

272
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:17,725
l told him l was gonna play
a male character in the movie.

273
00:19:17,813 --> 00:19:20,088
- What did he say?
- We discussed acting.

274
00:19:20,173 --> 00:19:22,812
l told him about
my award-winning <i>Pygmalion.</i>

275
00:19:22,893 --> 00:19:27,489
- Hobie, that was in college.
- lt was brilliant to play Henry with a limp.

276
00:19:27,573 --> 00:19:31,612
God, l hate being an assistant director.
After you've made your own film?

277
00:19:31,693 --> 00:19:35,242
Sad thing is, he could have
my movie happen like that.

278
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:37,972
What's $2 million to a real-estate billionaire?

279
00:19:38,053 --> 00:19:40,886
The upkeep of his private jet
is worth more than that.

280
00:19:40,973 --> 00:19:44,249
He was very impressed with you,
and you looked very sexy.

281
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:48,645
- Really? You thought l looked sexy?
- You are sexy. Really, you're very sexy.

282
00:19:48,733 --> 00:19:51,406
- Hobie, it's 2am.
- What's going on?

283
00:19:51,493 --> 00:19:55,406
We used to make love all the time,
and now there's always an excuse.

284
00:19:55,493 --> 00:19:59,247
l'm going through
an emotionally difficult time creatively.

285
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:04,168
- You feel we don't communicate?
- Of course we do. Can we not talk about it?

286
00:20:08,613 --> 00:20:11,491
Hi. Sorry l'm late.

287
00:20:11,573 --> 00:20:15,407
l saw these the other day.
l think they would look very beautiful on you.

288
00:20:15,493 --> 00:20:18,724
Beautiful, but you know Lee.
He gets crazy about my spending.

289
00:20:18,813 --> 00:20:21,202
How's he doing? You're not hurting for cash?

290
00:20:21,293 --> 00:20:24,091
He's on tenterhooks about the play,
but we're fine.

291
00:20:24,173 --> 00:20:27,927
He's got a number of irons on the fire,
some promising possibilities.

292
00:20:28,013 --> 00:20:31,164
- l have a very good prospect for Melinda.
- Ajob prospect?

293
00:20:31,253 --> 00:20:32,891
A guy.

294
00:20:32,973 --> 00:20:35,851
- Remember Bud Silverglide?
- No. Have l met him?

295
00:20:35,933 --> 00:20:40,290
Remember we had Thanksgiving at my house
and he brought his little girl Emily?

296
00:20:40,373 --> 00:20:43,763
- Emily... Emily?
- His wife had died the year before.

297
00:20:43,853 --> 00:20:46,367
Yes. l sat next to him.
He's average-looking.

298
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:48,409
He's fine. He'd be perfect.

299
00:20:48,493 --> 00:20:52,532
He's a very lovely guy. He's smart.
He's been through his share of suffering.

300
00:20:52,613 --> 00:20:55,332
Melinda would have a ready-made family.

301
00:20:55,413 --> 00:20:58,849
You think he's right for her?
l remember him as pleasant, but...

302
00:20:58,933 --> 00:21:03,290
She should be so lucky. He's got a very
successful dental practice in Manhattan.

303
00:21:03,373 --> 00:21:05,489
He plays bridge. He likes to hike.

304
00:21:05,573 --> 00:21:09,202
Think he'd be interested in Melinda,
especially when her past unfolds?

305
00:21:09,293 --> 00:21:12,729
l know. She's in no bargaining position
when all the facts come out.

306
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:14,963
Look, l can only bring them together.

307
00:21:15,053 --> 00:21:19,126
He's not the kind of guy who'd ever
wind up hurting her. That means a lot.

308
00:21:19,213 --> 00:21:22,410
Left to her own devices,
Melinda can be self-destructive.

309
00:21:22,493 --> 00:21:27,362
Bud is sweet, and l know he's lonely because
he's taken ads in the personal columns.

310
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:30,126
Don't tell Melinda that.

311
00:21:30,213 --> 00:21:33,888
Peter's checking into her custody case
to see if it's a lost cause.

312
00:21:33,973 --> 00:21:37,010
l told her to meet us here for lunch
after herjob interview.

313
00:21:37,093 --> 00:21:39,891
- Should we sit?
- l don't know. Can we take this table?

314
00:21:39,973 --> 00:21:41,725
Thanks.

315
00:21:41,813 --> 00:21:45,328
l know it's here somewhere.
We got this house guest living here.

316
00:21:45,413 --> 00:21:49,850
Everything's messed up. l wish she would
check before she moves my possessions.

317
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:53,608
l love your loft. lt's really amazing.

318
00:21:53,693 --> 00:21:57,402
Here we are.
An essay on Desdemona's role in <i>Othello.</i>

319
00:21:57,493 --> 00:22:01,645
The scene you should do in our next class
is the one we talked about yesterday.

320
00:22:01,733 --> 00:22:04,964
- You really think l'm ready for it?
- l do.

321
00:22:05,053 --> 00:22:08,523
You're among the two or three
most talented students in my class,

322
00:22:08,613 --> 00:22:11,446
and the sooner you challenge yourself,
the better.

323
00:22:11,533 --> 00:22:17,403
You're the only one who makes me feel
confident enough to take chances.

324
00:22:22,333 --> 00:22:24,801
Aren't you nervous bringing me back here?

325
00:22:24,893 --> 00:22:30,445
lt's OK. My wife's shopping, then going to
lunch. She's always shopping and lunching.

326
00:22:30,533 --> 00:22:35,971
She grew up shopping and lunching.
Her mother did, and her grandmother.

327
00:22:36,053 --> 00:22:39,602
You shouldn't really drink so early in the day.

328
00:22:39,693 --> 00:22:43,402
Shopping and lunching's what you get
when you marry a Park Avenue princess.

329
00:22:43,493 --> 00:22:46,451
- What does your wife do?
- Besides shopping?

330
00:22:46,533 --> 00:22:49,923
She teaches tin-eared teenagers
at a music school a few days a week.

331
00:22:50,013 --> 00:22:56,088
lt's funny, but life has a malicious way
of dealing with great potential.

332
00:23:01,613 --> 00:23:03,604
My God. Get...

333
00:23:12,653 --> 00:23:13,722
Hi.

334
00:23:13,813 --> 00:23:17,442
l just got back from my job interview.

335
00:23:18,253 --> 00:23:24,772
l don't think it went too well,
so just stopped off for a little pick-me-up.

336
00:23:24,853 --> 00:23:26,844
- You OK?
- Yeah.

337
00:23:27,933 --> 00:23:33,803
Yeah. Well, l'm gonna go and meet Laurel and
Cassie for lunch in our old neighbourhood.

338
00:23:38,693 --> 00:23:41,287
l'm just gonna go freshen up.

339
00:23:49,053 --> 00:23:54,002
- The park hasn't changed a bit.
- Not at all. lt brings back so many memories.

340
00:23:54,093 --> 00:23:58,848
Those days are gone when the three of us
thought we could call the shots.

341
00:23:58,933 --> 00:24:02,608
What l wouldn't give to wake up
and find my life has been a bad dream

342
00:24:02,693 --> 00:24:04,843
and we're all still 17.

343
00:24:04,933 --> 00:24:07,322
Tell me about it.

344
00:24:07,413 --> 00:24:12,089
You wouldn't change anything. l mean,
your life is pretty much on track, right?

345
00:24:12,173 --> 00:24:18,408
Well, the question's not fair. l mean, who
wouldn't profit from a second go around?

346
00:24:18,493 --> 00:24:20,882
So, what about Bud Silverglide?

347
00:24:21,653 --> 00:24:24,372
The dentist with the charming little daughter?

348
00:24:24,453 --> 00:24:28,685
He's a wonderful guy. lf anything
ever did happen and you hit it off,

349
00:24:28,773 --> 00:24:31,162
you could establish something solid.

350
00:24:31,253 --> 00:24:34,962
Not more unrealistic pipe dreams
that can't help but wind up badly.

351
00:24:35,053 --> 00:24:38,284
l'm sorry. Did that come out harsh?

352
00:24:38,373 --> 00:24:41,843
The truth is, l'm nervous.
l wanna meet someone so desperately,

353
00:24:41,933 --> 00:24:45,403
but when the chance comes along,
l just panic.

354
00:24:45,493 --> 00:24:50,328
lt won't be a date. l'll make a dinner party
and we'll all be there to support you.

355
00:24:50,413 --> 00:24:53,723
l'll invite a number of nice guests
and he'll be one of them,

356
00:24:53,813 --> 00:24:58,933
and if you meet and hit if off, then great,
and if not, then no obligation.

357
00:24:59,693 --> 00:25:03,322
Yeah. When he hears my story...
My God. l come with such baggage.

358
00:25:03,413 --> 00:25:07,929
- Well, don't go in with a defeatist attitude.
- Yeah. First see if you even like him.

359
00:25:08,013 --> 00:25:10,527
lf he's as nice as Cassie's painting him...

360
00:25:10,613 --> 00:25:13,127
He's a good catch,
if l can speak pragmatically,

361
00:25:13,213 --> 00:25:16,967
especially for you,
cos he's got his feet on the ground.

362
00:25:17,053 --> 00:25:22,127
lf l find him at all attractive, l think l should
just tell him my whole story right off.

363
00:25:22,213 --> 00:25:27,526
Or do you think it's better to wait? Let him
take the hook first, and then run with it?

364
00:25:27,613 --> 00:25:31,162
God. l can't believe l'm even asking this.

365
00:25:31,253 --> 00:25:34,245
l'm already strategising.
l haven't met this guy yet.

366
00:25:34,333 --> 00:25:37,530
lf we're gonna do this,
it has to be completely informal,

367
00:25:37,613 --> 00:25:43,165
cos l can't handle it any other way.
l don't have any dressy clothes anyhow.

368
00:25:43,253 --> 00:25:46,325
Funny part of that is,
as elegant as l can look -

369
00:25:46,413 --> 00:25:50,326
and you know, l can look pretty stylish -

370
00:25:50,413 --> 00:25:53,689
men find women sexier in casual attire.

371
00:25:54,613 --> 00:25:58,128
lt's true. l could wear my hair down and loose.

372
00:25:58,213 --> 00:26:02,092
That's enticing already.
At least it's not intimidating.

373
00:26:02,173 --> 00:26:05,688
- You haven't told him anything about me?
- l can if you like.

374
00:26:05,773 --> 00:26:07,843
No. No.

375
00:26:07,933 --> 00:26:14,406
My sad tale should come from my lips,
if and when l choose to reveal it.

376
00:26:16,413 --> 00:26:19,644
Cut. OK, great. That was great. lt was great.

377
00:26:19,733 --> 00:26:22,327
You took the note great. Print one and six.

378
00:26:22,413 --> 00:26:25,962
You got it? OK, hey, everybody,
that's lunch. One hour. Thank you.

379
00:26:26,053 --> 00:26:29,170
- Hey, are you gonnajoin us?
- No. l'm meeting a friend.

380
00:26:29,253 --> 00:26:32,086
Tell the actors we're gonna do
scene ten instead of 26.

381
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:35,802
OK. We're doing scene ten instead of 26.

382
00:26:42,093 --> 00:26:43,606
- Hey.
- Hey.

383
00:26:43,693 --> 00:26:46,366
- Should we just sit here?
- Yeah.

384
00:26:47,293 --> 00:26:52,845
- So, what did he say?
- That Steve is inclined to put up the money.

385
00:26:53,693 --> 00:26:56,446
He likes your script
and wants to have lunch with you.

386
00:26:56,533 --> 00:26:58,808
- Fantastic!
- Yeah, it looks really good.

387
00:26:58,893 --> 00:27:02,522
He was concerned that you intended for
Hobie to play the psychiatrist.

388
00:27:02,613 --> 00:27:05,605
- You know, he wants a name.
- l understand.

389
00:27:05,693 --> 00:27:08,127
lt's gonna be kind of
a touchy subject at home

390
00:27:08,213 --> 00:27:12,570
because, l mean, the truth is
he'd make the perfect shrink, and he knows it.

391
00:27:12,653 --> 00:27:17,773
But, let's face it, he's not a name,
and l want people to see my movie too, so...

392
00:27:17,853 --> 00:27:22,449
Well, l'm sure that you guys will figure it out,
and l think it's very exciting.

393
00:27:22,533 --> 00:27:25,252
Doug and l know somebody
perfect for Melinda,

394
00:27:25,333 --> 00:27:27,927
your downstairs neighbour
who crashed dinner.

395
00:27:28,013 --> 00:27:29,969
- Remember Greg Earlinger?
- No.

396
00:27:30,053 --> 00:27:33,932
- Doug's dentist. You met him with us once.
- Yes. He has a great sports car.

397
00:27:34,013 --> 00:27:36,447
The Bentley. He's single and available.

398
00:27:36,533 --> 00:27:39,684
She would find him fascinating.
He's smart, sensitive...

399
00:27:39,773 --> 00:27:41,809
Why would he be interested in her?

400
00:27:41,893 --> 00:27:46,603
She seemed quite pretty, she's offbeat
and Greg always likes complicated women.

401
00:27:46,693 --> 00:27:52,245
Doug has already hyped him on her.
Ask her if we can give him her number, OK?

402
00:28:01,413 --> 00:28:02,892
- Hey.
- Melinda.

403
00:28:02,973 --> 00:28:04,008
- Hey.
- Hi.

404
00:28:04,093 --> 00:28:05,606
Hi.

405
00:28:05,693 --> 00:28:08,491
My friend Walt. This is Melinda.
She just moved in.

406
00:28:08,573 --> 00:28:10,450
- How are you?
- Nice to meet you.

407
00:28:10,533 --> 00:28:12,649
- How's it going?
- All right.

408
00:28:12,733 --> 00:28:17,170
l just interviewed for ajob at an art gallery
and l don't think it went too well.

409
00:28:17,253 --> 00:28:21,371
You never know. l had a voice-over audition
today. Thought l'd never get it.

410
00:28:21,453 --> 00:28:24,968
Bang, l was chosen.
lt's the voice of a toothpaste.

411
00:28:25,053 --> 00:28:29,126
That's good. l'm trying to decide
whether to stay and wait for the phone call

412
00:28:29,213 --> 00:28:32,569
or whether l should go out
and treat myself to a movie.

413
00:28:32,653 --> 00:28:35,087
Why don't you come with us?

414
00:28:35,173 --> 00:28:37,641
- Where?
- Going to the track.

415
00:28:37,733 --> 00:28:41,248
- To the track?
- Yeah. Horse races. Belmont.

416
00:28:41,333 --> 00:28:44,211
- What, you play the horses?
- Never.

417
00:28:44,293 --> 00:28:48,605
Well, l go every ten years. Walt's always
going. He's a gambling degenerate.

418
00:28:48,693 --> 00:28:52,606
- Yes. Can't you tell l'm a degenerate?
- l'm a complete novice, like you.

419
00:28:52,693 --> 00:28:55,924
Come on. lt's a beautiful day.
We'll have some laughs.

420
00:28:56,013 --> 00:29:00,882
- Sure. l don't have any money.
- l've got plenty of money.

421
00:29:00,973 --> 00:29:03,885
For both of us. We'll pool our resources.

422
00:29:03,973 --> 00:29:06,612
- lf you want.
- OK. All right. Yeah.

423
00:29:06,693 --> 00:29:08,968
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you again.

424
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:15,325
- Come on! Come on, Bedazzled!
- Let's go, Bedazzled.

425
00:29:15,413 --> 00:29:18,371
No, no. You did not bet on Bedazzled.
lt's a 90-1 horse!

426
00:29:18,453 --> 00:29:22,241
- lf it wins, we're rich.
- He's right, Hobie. He's dropping back.

427
00:29:22,333 --> 00:29:25,962
No, no, no, no, no. He's second.
He's second... second from last.

428
00:29:28,613 --> 00:29:34,688
So, l have to ask you, how'd you go from
living on the Upper East Side to St Louis?

429
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:37,651
l moved there for him. He was gorgeous.

430
00:29:37,733 --> 00:29:42,761
He was talented, he was sexy,
he was a doctor, he was charming...

431
00:29:42,853 --> 00:29:44,844
Yes, but where's the attraction?

432
00:29:44,933 --> 00:29:48,084
- He just knew how to touch me.
- You mean emotionally?

433
00:29:48,173 --> 00:29:50,004
No, with his hands.

434
00:29:50,093 --> 00:29:54,405
l'm a very passionate person,
so sex is very important to me.

435
00:29:54,493 --> 00:29:58,566
You know, l need a lot of physical intimacy
very often and creatively.

436
00:29:58,653 --> 00:30:02,168
Right. Right, right, right, right.
That's... that's... Yeah.

437
00:30:02,253 --> 00:30:05,529
- Am l being too frank?
- No, no, no. No, l just...

438
00:30:05,613 --> 00:30:08,252
l'll be OK. l get hot flashes.

439
00:30:08,333 --> 00:30:12,451
- Your wife is passionate. l can tell by looking.
- Right, right.

440
00:30:12,533 --> 00:30:17,129
A lot of people have noticed.
Why did your marriage fail again?

441
00:30:17,213 --> 00:30:19,886
He was cheating with his secretary.

442
00:30:19,973 --> 00:30:24,285
l felt neglected,
so l started seeing someone else.

443
00:30:24,373 --> 00:30:28,844
l just wanna find someone,
fall in love and have a life.

444
00:31:16,213 --> 00:31:19,444
- Hello.
- Hey. Guess what?

445
00:31:19,533 --> 00:31:22,923
- What?
- Steve is putting up the money for my film.

446
00:31:23,013 --> 00:31:25,573
That's great. Congratulations.

447
00:31:25,653 --> 00:31:29,566
So if l'm suddenly very busy and distracted,
don't take it personally.

448
00:31:29,653 --> 00:31:32,372
- And we have to talk about casting.
- Yes.

449
00:31:32,453 --> 00:31:36,412
- What did you do today?
- l told you. l went out to the track.

450
00:31:36,493 --> 00:31:38,882
Yeah. With who again?

451
00:31:38,973 --> 00:31:44,047
With who? With me, with me.
With me... me and Walt. Walt Wagner.

452
00:31:44,133 --> 00:31:48,206
- Well, l hope you didn't lose a lot.
- No. We don't have a lot, so l couldn't.

453
00:31:48,293 --> 00:31:51,808
ln fact, if l had more money,
we could've lost more.

454
00:31:51,893 --> 00:31:54,248
lt's a system l developed.

455
00:31:54,333 --> 00:31:57,564
Why didn't you just tell her
Melinda came along?

456
00:31:57,653 --> 00:32:00,531
- What did you just say about Melinda?
- What? No.

457
00:32:00,613 --> 00:32:02,683
l didn't say anything about Melinda.

458
00:32:02,773 --> 00:32:07,608
- You just muttered her name.
- l was wondering how the poor thing's doing.

459
00:32:07,693 --> 00:32:10,161
You know, plain-looking girl, all alone...

460
00:32:10,253 --> 00:32:12,687
- l'd hardly call her plain-looking.
- Well...

461
00:32:12,773 --> 00:32:17,289
Jennifer wants to set her up with someone.
Remember Greg Earlinger, Doug's dentist?

462
00:32:17,373 --> 00:32:21,889
We met him once. He's a tall, sexy,
handsome-looking guy. The Bentley.

463
00:32:21,973 --> 00:32:24,328
Very well off. Charming, bright.

464
00:32:24,413 --> 00:32:28,326
- You commented on how impressive he was.
- Vaguely.

465
00:32:28,413 --> 00:32:32,725
- Anyway, Doug's hyped him on Melinda.
- Yeah, l think... Why, l do recall him.

466
00:32:32,813 --> 00:32:37,045
Wasn't he full of himself, though?
Kind of an unjustified self-confidence?

467
00:32:37,133 --> 00:32:41,365
- As l recall, it was justified.
- Someone who has an answer for everything.

468
00:32:41,453 --> 00:32:44,411
l'm gonna ask Melinda
if it's OK if we give him her number.

469
00:32:44,493 --> 00:32:47,929
No. No, don't be silly.
What does she wanna do with a dentist?

470
00:32:48,013 --> 00:32:51,210
She was already married to a doctor.
She found that dull.

471
00:32:51,293 --> 00:32:54,490
- A dentist is the same thing, but oral.
- Greg's not dull.

472
00:32:54,573 --> 00:32:58,407
He hikes. He's a great bridge player.
Tennis. He goes on safaris.

473
00:32:58,493 --> 00:33:02,281
Well, it ... l mean, who goes on safaris?

474
00:33:02,373 --> 00:33:06,764
- You need shots to do that.
- Melinda, hey, it's Susan. How are you?

475
00:33:06,853 --> 00:33:11,529
Good. l was wondering if it was OK with you
if we give your number to this wonderful guy.

476
00:33:11,613 --> 00:33:14,764
l'm not giving the number out.
Don't say that l am...

477
00:33:14,853 --> 00:33:19,131
He's a very rich dentist. He's cultivated
and athletic. He's gorgeous-looking.

478
00:33:19,213 --> 00:33:21,204
''Gorgeous dentist'' is an oxymoron.

479
00:33:21,293 --> 00:33:26,048
And... There's nothing to be nervous about.
Look, we'll all go out, the four of us.

480
00:33:26,133 --> 00:33:30,843
We'll go to dinner or we'll go to a show
or something. l don't think you'll be sorry.

481
00:33:30,933 --> 00:33:34,846
- l think she's never, ever gonna go for it.
- OK, great.

482
00:33:34,933 --> 00:33:37,970
- Not in a million years.
- Fantastic. OK, bye.

483
00:33:38,053 --> 00:33:41,762
- She loves the idea.
- l told you.

484
00:33:44,573 --> 00:33:46,609
Hi. What are you doing down here?

485
00:33:46,693 --> 00:33:50,891
l got the part! The director kept insisting
and the producers finally gave in.

486
00:33:50,973 --> 00:33:55,205
- That's great, Lee.
- Finally, a role l can make sing.

487
00:33:55,293 --> 00:33:57,853
You're certainly a natural for the character.

488
00:33:57,933 --> 00:34:01,050
- Why would you say that?
- You've said it a hundred times.

489
00:34:01,133 --> 00:34:03,886
l said l could act the hell out of it. He's a loser.

490
00:34:03,973 --> 00:34:07,249
Let's not fight. l meant
nobody can play the part like you can.

491
00:34:07,333 --> 00:34:10,769
You see me like that, don't you?
l'm asking. ls that how you see me?

492
00:34:10,853 --> 00:34:15,131
l'm really happy for you. l know how much
you wanted this. Can't we leave it at that?

493
00:34:15,213 --> 00:34:19,729
l'm wired. l didn't mean to seem snappish.
Shall we go out to dinner and celebrate?

494
00:34:19,813 --> 00:34:24,091
- Tonight's Cassie's party.
- Yeah, right. OK. Jesus.

495
00:34:24,173 --> 00:34:28,724
lt's time Melinda met someone, moved on.
l'd like a little privacy in the apartment.

496
00:34:29,413 --> 00:34:31,529
OK.

497
00:34:31,613 --> 00:34:34,047
l've got a couple of options.

498
00:34:34,133 --> 00:34:36,124
l could wear...

499
00:34:36,213 --> 00:34:38,932
l can wear this skirt

500
00:34:39,013 --> 00:34:41,288
with this shirt, like this.

501
00:34:41,373 --> 00:34:45,924
This goes around the other way, like this,
and l could wear it with this shirt here.

502
00:34:46,013 --> 00:34:50,086
- What do you think?
- The silk one is sexier, but this one's elegant.

503
00:34:50,173 --> 00:34:54,849
You think the silk one's sexier? So maybe
l should wear this. Sex works best in the end.

504
00:34:54,933 --> 00:35:00,724
Men like to feel there's some hot payoff
waiting for 'em somewhere down the track.

505
00:35:00,813 --> 00:35:05,967
- God, look at me. l'm so fat.
- Fat? Melinda, everyone should be so fat.

506
00:35:06,053 --> 00:35:09,648
l didn't eat anything since Friday.
l wanted to lose six pounds.

507
00:35:09,733 --> 00:35:15,046
lt's not healthy. l mean, an empty stomach
and all those pills, and...

508
00:35:15,133 --> 00:35:19,968
l don't know. Maybe this is better. Maybe
sex is too predatory a message to send,

509
00:35:20,053 --> 00:35:22,772
and elegance is a wiser opening gambit.

510
00:35:22,853 --> 00:35:26,129
l don't think it matters much.
You look great. Doesn't she?

511
00:35:26,213 --> 00:35:29,250
Yeah. Very stylish.

512
00:35:29,333 --> 00:35:34,088
Look at me. l'm fat. l can't lose any weight.
l think l need another drink.

513
00:35:34,173 --> 00:35:36,164
Alcohol's fattening.

514
00:35:37,333 --> 00:35:40,609
- Can you make it a vodka?
- Plus an empty stomach with pills?

515
00:35:40,693 --> 00:35:43,844
Vodka's not fattening.
l need something to calm me down,

516
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:46,572
just to make me a little more confident.

517
00:35:46,653 --> 00:35:51,329
- l've got goddamn circles under my eyes.
- You look fine.

518
00:35:51,773 --> 00:35:54,970
That's easy for you to say
because you're still beautiful.

519
00:35:55,053 --> 00:35:57,123
l feel like l'm running on empty.

520
00:35:57,213 --> 00:36:00,489
l don't wanna go.
Honestly, l don't wanna go to this thing.

521
00:36:00,573 --> 00:36:04,452
Come on. lt's just a little party with friends.

522
00:36:08,173 --> 00:36:13,566
How did l wind up desperate? Because that's
what l am, Laurel. There's no other word.

523
00:36:13,653 --> 00:36:16,645
You're a catch for the right man.
You really are.

524
00:36:16,733 --> 00:36:20,772
Falling in love
is gonna work wonders for you.

525
00:36:26,733 --> 00:36:30,282
- Congratulations. l hear Lee got that part.
- We're very excited.

526
00:36:30,373 --> 00:36:35,242
No one at school played the classics like Lee.
They still talk about the Strindberg series.

527
00:36:35,333 --> 00:36:40,009
Yes. He's held himself back from commercial
work because he's got such high standards.

528
00:36:40,093 --> 00:36:42,607
- He won't do anything just for the money.
- Yeah.

529
00:36:47,493 --> 00:36:52,123
l knew that director would have his way,
and he wanted you.

530
00:36:52,213 --> 00:36:56,968
My agent'll bring film people to the opening
cos there's talk of a project in California.

531
00:36:57,053 --> 00:37:00,523
l'd drink to your good fortune,
but vodka's not good for Samantha.

532
00:37:00,613 --> 00:37:02,604
lt's gonna be a girl.

533
00:37:02,693 --> 00:37:05,491
Cassie, l never slept
with a pregnant woman before.

534
00:37:05,573 --> 00:37:06,642
- No?
- No.

535
00:37:06,733 --> 00:37:10,203
lt always struck me as so erotic -
doing it with your big belly.

536
00:37:10,293 --> 00:37:14,002
Peter says it's just like
screwing any fat person.

537
00:37:14,093 --> 00:37:19,008
l don't suppose he'd lend you out to me
so l could satisfy a lifelong lustful curiosity?

538
00:37:19,093 --> 00:37:23,723
Why don't you get Laurel pregnant? Then
you wouldn't need to make arrangements.

539
00:37:23,813 --> 00:37:28,887
Maybe if things work out now, we can start to
think about it. l always wanted to have kids.

540
00:37:28,973 --> 00:37:32,568
Knock her up, then you can
make love to her in all the trimesters.

541
00:37:32,653 --> 00:37:37,010
lf you knew how much l wanted to do it with
you, you'd do itjust out of human kindness.

542
00:37:37,093 --> 00:37:40,847
Too late. Ball was in your court years ago.
You ran in another direction.

543
00:37:40,933 --> 00:37:44,482
How's our matchmaking going?
They seem to be hitting it off well.

544
00:37:44,573 --> 00:37:47,804
Peter, what's it like
to sleep with a pregnant woman?

545
00:37:47,893 --> 00:37:51,488
Have you ever made love
with a loser at Weight Watchers?

546
00:37:51,573 --> 00:37:54,326
Didn't l tell you?

547
00:37:54,773 --> 00:37:57,970
The great thing about hiking is you're free.

548
00:37:58,053 --> 00:38:00,044
You feel free.

549
00:38:00,133 --> 00:38:06,208
You're up there in the mountains
or in the woods, and it's beautiful.

550
00:38:06,293 --> 00:38:08,932
Almost religious.

551
00:38:09,013 --> 00:38:11,083
And l am not religious.

552
00:38:11,173 --> 00:38:14,643
Certainly not after Dorothy passed away.

553
00:38:15,813 --> 00:38:18,646
That must have been really tough
on your daughter.

554
00:38:18,733 --> 00:38:23,648
l've tried to explain it all to Emily,
including the whole religious aspect,

555
00:38:23,733 --> 00:38:26,645
but what the hell? She's four.

556
00:38:27,453 --> 00:38:32,732
l just don't want her to be angry at God
or against religion.

557
00:38:32,813 --> 00:38:36,089
l want her to be happy and educate herself

558
00:38:36,173 --> 00:38:40,610
and make her own decisions
about the big questions.

559
00:38:41,933 --> 00:38:44,288
Look, Melinda,

560
00:38:44,373 --> 00:38:49,606
l'd love to call you. Maybe we could spend
some time getting to know one another.

561
00:38:49,693 --> 00:38:53,686
l know you just returned to New York,
but it's really changed.

562
00:38:53,773 --> 00:38:56,765
l'd be glad to show you around.

563
00:38:56,853 --> 00:39:01,051
To tell you the truth, Bud,
l don't really think l'm ready to go out yet.

564
00:39:01,133 --> 00:39:05,684
l don't think it would be fair to you.
Maybe when l'm a little more settled.

565
00:39:05,773 --> 00:39:07,889
Sure. At your leisure.

566
00:39:07,973 --> 00:39:10,441
l understand.

567
00:39:10,533 --> 00:39:12,603
Jesus.

568
00:39:12,693 --> 00:39:17,289
Emily's with a new sitter tonight
and, of course, l'm a basket case.

569
00:39:17,373 --> 00:39:21,161
- That's very sweet.
- Would you excuse me?

570
00:39:42,853 --> 00:39:45,526
Laurel, you know this one. Play.

571
00:39:47,493 --> 00:39:51,372
- l can't. He plays so beautifully.
- Hey, here. Come on.

572
00:39:51,453 --> 00:39:53,444
Come on.

573
00:40:10,133 --> 00:40:12,727
Take over. You're wonderful.

574
00:40:44,613 --> 00:40:47,923
Sorry. l didn't mean to interrupt.
l'm just gonna get a drink.

575
00:40:48,013 --> 00:40:52,370
That's OK. l was just rubbing this lamp,
hoping to change my life.

576
00:40:52,453 --> 00:40:56,844
Well, l believe in magic. ln the end,
l think it's the only thing that can save us.

577
00:40:56,933 --> 00:41:01,245
- You're the piano player.
- Not any more. l'm on a break.

578
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:05,963
A mysterious stranger has temporarily
taken over. l must say, she plays beautifully.

579
00:41:06,053 --> 00:41:07,805
Hey.

580
00:41:07,893 --> 00:41:10,088
Are your eyes misting over?

581
00:41:10,173 --> 00:41:14,928
This song, it's meaningful to me.
lt was playing the night l met someone.

582
00:41:15,013 --> 00:41:17,766
So are they tears of sorrow or tears ofjoy?

583
00:41:17,853 --> 00:41:20,845
Well, aren't those the same tears?

584
00:41:21,973 --> 00:41:23,486
Yeah.

585
00:41:23,573 --> 00:41:29,284
Why do things that start off so promisingly
always have a way of ending up in the dump?

586
00:41:29,373 --> 00:41:33,366
- Not for everyone.
- Well, for anybody with any imagination.

587
00:41:33,453 --> 00:41:37,002
You know, life is manageable enough
if you keep your hopes modest.

588
00:41:37,093 --> 00:41:42,042
The minute you allow yourself sweet dreams
you run the risk of them crashing down.

589
00:41:42,133 --> 00:41:44,772
There's plenty of old songs that l cry over.

590
00:41:44,853 --> 00:41:47,367
My name is Melinda.

591
00:41:47,453 --> 00:41:50,411
Melinda Robicheaux. lt's French.

592
00:41:50,493 --> 00:41:54,372
- That's a very beautiful name.
- Thank you. lt's my mother's.

593
00:41:54,453 --> 00:41:59,288
She married a Dr Nash, so l grew up Nash,
but l've changed it to her name.

594
00:41:59,373 --> 00:42:01,603
And that is a wise choice.

595
00:42:01,693 --> 00:42:03,649
lt's very musical.

596
00:42:03,733 --> 00:42:07,328
My name is Ellis Moonsong.
l am from Harlem, USA.

597
00:42:07,413 --> 00:42:10,928
Ellis Moonsong. ls that really your name?

598
00:42:11,013 --> 00:42:13,846
Yes, it is. Let's go and sit down.

599
00:42:13,933 --> 00:42:17,846
lt's wonderful. You also play beautifully.

600
00:42:17,933 --> 00:42:20,572
Well, one thing l could always do
was make music.

601
00:42:20,653 --> 00:42:24,805
l can play all the instruments,
but my specialty is composition.

602
00:42:24,893 --> 00:42:28,966
l've written two operas. One was done
at Yale, l'm proud to say successfully,

603
00:42:29,053 --> 00:42:32,602
and the other one is being done
in Santa Fe next summer.

604
00:42:32,693 --> 00:42:35,491
- Very impressive.
- Yeah, listen to me brag.

605
00:42:35,573 --> 00:42:39,566
l'm insecure, so l sell myself.
The truth is, not everybody likes the music.

606
00:42:39,653 --> 00:42:43,612
They're kind of modern,
but the critics were extremely supportive.

607
00:42:43,693 --> 00:42:47,003
ls that what you wanna be -
another Verdi or Puccini?

608
00:42:47,093 --> 00:42:50,005
l don't kid myself, you know, but, yeah.

609
00:42:50,093 --> 00:42:54,405
lf l could rub that lamp and have my wish...
Operas, symphonies, string quartets.

610
00:42:54,493 --> 00:42:59,772
There's a lot of interest in my work in Europe.
l might go to Barcelona or to Paris to live.

611
00:42:59,853 --> 00:43:05,723
God, l can't stop gushing about myself.
You've opened Pandora's box.

612
00:43:05,813 --> 00:43:07,724
And you?

613
00:43:07,813 --> 00:43:11,772
l don't write opera,
but my life has been one.

614
00:43:11,853 --> 00:43:17,211
l'm one of those heroines too high-strung
for existence on this planet,

615
00:43:17,293 --> 00:43:19,887
although l brought
my worst troubles on myself.

616
00:43:19,973 --> 00:43:23,363
l shouldn't have reached
so thoughtlessly for my dreams.

617
00:43:23,453 --> 00:43:26,809
We grab without thinking
because we're passionate people.

618
00:43:26,893 --> 00:43:29,612
l knew you were passionate
once we started talking.

619
00:43:29,693 --> 00:43:32,366
- How?
- How?

620
00:43:32,453 --> 00:43:34,569
Well, your eyes, your voice.

621
00:43:34,653 --> 00:43:37,565
l got a great instinct about people.

622
00:43:37,653 --> 00:43:39,609
You know, l do. lt's a gift.

623
00:43:39,693 --> 00:43:42,969
Let me get right to the point.
Can l get to know you better?

624
00:43:43,053 --> 00:43:47,490
l gotta go back and play, but
could we have lunch, you know, or dinner?

625
00:43:47,573 --> 00:43:50,849
You can certainly have my number,
if that's what you're asking.

626
00:43:53,493 --> 00:43:56,007
Let me... l'll just get a pen.

627
00:43:56,093 --> 00:43:58,084
There you are.

628
00:43:58,173 --> 00:44:02,052
- l saw Mr Bud Silverglide.
- The mystery pianist.

629
00:44:02,133 --> 00:44:05,364
Mr Moonsong, Ellis Moonsong, this is Laurel.

630
00:44:05,453 --> 00:44:09,002
Laurel? l dated a Laurel.
She broke my heart.

631
00:44:09,093 --> 00:44:13,086
l wrote this piece of music and l dedicated it
to her hoping it would win her back.

632
00:44:13,173 --> 00:44:17,212
- Let me be the first to tell you, it did not.
- He composes serious music.

633
00:44:17,293 --> 00:44:20,603
You two should have a lot to discuss
cos Laurel gave concerts.

634
00:44:20,693 --> 00:44:23,002
Those days vanished with the lost chord.

635
00:44:23,093 --> 00:44:27,166
His opera was a big success at Yale
and they're doing the other one where?

636
00:44:27,253 --> 00:44:29,892
At the Santa Fe Opera House.

637
00:44:30,613 --> 00:44:33,332
lt's great when it's stretched out
in front of you.

638
00:44:33,413 --> 00:44:36,052
Well, l wish l was as optimistic as you.

639
00:44:36,133 --> 00:44:39,523
- Well, l'll call you tomorrow.
- l'm busy tomorrow.

640
00:44:39,613 --> 00:44:42,889
- What's tomorrow?
- Well, then, l'll call you the day after.

641
00:44:42,973 --> 00:44:45,168
lf you feel like it.

642
00:44:50,613 --> 00:44:54,447
What happened with you
and the swell dentist?

643
00:44:54,533 --> 00:44:56,603
He was very, very sweet.

644
00:44:56,693 --> 00:44:58,411
Very cute.

645
00:44:58,493 --> 00:45:00,688
Butjust not for me.

646
00:45:01,533 --> 00:45:06,846
But Ellis Moonsong is very poetic.

647
00:45:06,933 --> 00:45:08,525
Melinda.

648
00:45:08,613 --> 00:45:10,968
Things are amazing.

649
00:45:11,053 --> 00:45:13,408
You meet a stranger, and in a sudden rush,

650
00:45:13,493 --> 00:45:16,929
you're thinking to yourself,
''Could l live in Barcelona?''

651
00:45:17,013 --> 00:45:23,009
Be careful. l mean, you can't go through life
rubbing lamps and wishing.

652
00:45:24,173 --> 00:45:27,165
lt doesn't work. Take it from me.

653
00:45:36,453 --> 00:45:37,932
Hey.

654
00:45:38,013 --> 00:45:39,810
Greg Earlinger.

655
00:45:41,693 --> 00:45:44,127
Hi.

656
00:45:44,213 --> 00:45:46,886
- Greg Earlinger.
- l'm Susan. We've met.

657
00:45:46,973 --> 00:45:49,851
- This is Melinda.
- Yes, wow.

658
00:45:49,933 --> 00:45:52,401
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

659
00:45:52,493 --> 00:45:55,405
- So, this is Hobie.
- You're the gynaecologist.

660
00:45:55,493 --> 00:45:57,802
- Close. No, l'm the dentist.
- Dentist.

661
00:45:57,893 --> 00:46:00,691
Dentist. What were you thinking?

662
00:46:05,493 --> 00:46:10,328
- l love it at this time of year. lt's so beautiful.
- lt's nice when it's so bright, huh?

663
00:46:10,413 --> 00:46:13,325
You know, it's really sexy, isn't it?

664
00:46:13,413 --> 00:46:17,486
- You look a little carsick.
- Why? Cos l'm the colour of guacamole?

665
00:46:17,573 --> 00:46:21,566
This is going well.
Look how happy she looks.

666
00:46:21,653 --> 00:46:26,010
l wish we could afford a pad in the Hamptons.
Everybody who's anybody has one.

667
00:46:26,093 --> 00:46:31,213
But if you're somebody who's nobody, it's no
fun to be around anybody who's everybody.

668
00:46:31,293 --> 00:46:34,205
lsn't he charming?
And don't tell me he's not gorgeous.

669
00:46:34,293 --> 00:46:36,523
lf you like perfect features.

670
00:46:36,613 --> 00:46:38,683
Don't be such a crab.

671
00:46:38,773 --> 00:46:41,845
l'm gonna try to come out here more often.

672
00:46:42,813 --> 00:46:45,486
- Wow, it's so big.
- Thank you.

673
00:46:45,573 --> 00:46:49,566
lt's so clean, too.
lt's a great place to entertain, which l love.

674
00:46:49,653 --> 00:46:52,850
- God, Hobie, isn't it amazing?
- Yeah, l love the ramp.

675
00:46:52,933 --> 00:46:56,130
lt's wheelchair accessible.
That's important out here.

676
00:46:56,213 --> 00:46:58,886
- Go ahead, guys. Go in.
- Thanks.

677
00:47:02,333 --> 00:47:06,326
lt's tremendous for aerobics.
Come on, try it, Hobie.

678
00:47:06,413 --> 00:47:08,369
What do you do for exercise?

679
00:47:08,453 --> 00:47:11,843
Tiddlywinks.
And an occasional anxiety attack.

680
00:47:11,933 --> 00:47:16,404
- Try it, Hobie. lt's good manners.
- Since when do l have good manners?

681
00:47:16,493 --> 00:47:19,803
- What is that? ls it a pig?
- l don't know.

682
00:47:19,893 --> 00:47:22,123
Hey, Greg, did you shoot this?

683
00:47:22,213 --> 00:47:24,773
Well, actually, l shot all of those.

684
00:47:24,853 --> 00:47:28,926
Twice a year l go to Africa.
The experience would take your breath away.

685
00:47:29,013 --> 00:47:32,005
Huge herds of kudu -
greater kudu and lesser kudu.

686
00:47:32,093 --> 00:47:35,369
- Which is bigger? The greater or the lesser?
- Hobie!

687
00:47:35,453 --> 00:47:41,528
l think it would be the sexiest thing to sleep
under the stars in the middle of the jungle...

688
00:47:41,613 --> 00:47:45,128
lf you don't mind waking up
with a python in your sleeping bag.

689
00:47:45,213 --> 00:47:49,729
No, no. The whole thing is very civilised.
They have beds and bathrooms and showers.

690
00:47:49,813 --> 00:47:54,603
But no elevators. ln case you're being chased
by a tiger and you have to get up into a tree.

691
00:47:54,693 --> 00:47:57,685
- l'd have to take the elevator.
- l don't understand.

692
00:47:57,773 --> 00:48:00,287
- Me neither.
- Did you shoot all the furniture?

693
00:48:00,373 --> 00:48:05,083
- So, Melinda, have you ever shot a gun?
- How quickly was it shot? Freshly shot?

694
00:48:10,093 --> 00:48:12,926
- Right here?
- That's fine. This was fun. Thank you.

695
00:48:13,013 --> 00:48:15,652
- Are you sure you'll be all right?
- l'm fine.

696
00:48:15,733 --> 00:48:19,646
- Do you wanna come up for a drink?
- A drink! Yeah, we could do that.

697
00:48:19,733 --> 00:48:22,850
- We can't. You have to get up early.
- Why? l'm out of work.

698
00:48:22,933 --> 00:48:26,721
Hey, do you have any tequila?
l make the world's most potent margarita.

699
00:48:26,813 --> 00:48:28,849
- They're very strong.
- l sure do.

700
00:48:28,933 --> 00:48:31,493
- Are you all right?
- Here, can l help you?

701
00:48:31,573 --> 00:48:34,883
- Very good. You know this car so well.
- He's like an old man.

702
00:48:34,973 --> 00:48:38,045
- Thank you.
- l'm fine.

703
00:48:38,133 --> 00:48:39,725
lt's like we're dancing.

704
00:48:39,813 --> 00:48:42,964
- Tequila's on the surgeon general's list.
- Just be quiet.

705
00:48:43,053 --> 00:48:46,090
Why'd he stop twice to get the car washed?

706
00:48:46,613 --> 00:48:50,891
God, he's incredible, isn't he?
lt'd be great for Melinda if things worked out.

707
00:48:50,973 --> 00:48:53,407
l wouldn't let that guy fill my teeth.

708
00:48:53,493 --> 00:48:56,929
l mean, anyone who gets his jollies
putting holes in animals...

709
00:48:57,013 --> 00:48:59,846
The Ernest Hemingway of the root canal set.

710
00:48:59,933 --> 00:49:02,652
He's probably got her in bed by now.

711
00:49:03,453 --> 00:49:06,013
l didn't think she could stand him.

712
00:49:06,093 --> 00:49:08,971
Not every woman falls
for that phoney social rap,

713
00:49:09,053 --> 00:49:14,923
you know, with the Haut-Brion and
special cheeses and backgammon trophy.

714
00:49:15,013 --> 00:49:17,322
Someone must blow him up with an air hose.

715
00:49:17,413 --> 00:49:22,646
You know what? Can we just not discuss it?
And, frankly, l thought you acted like a clown.

716
00:49:22,733 --> 00:49:26,123
Now, can l talk to you for a minute?
And try not to get upset.

717
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:30,729
What? You wanna spend more time in
the Hamptons whether l go with you or not?

718
00:49:30,813 --> 00:49:33,646
l told you Steve Walsh
is gonna co-produce my film.

719
00:49:33,733 --> 00:49:38,011
Yes, that's fantastic. l figured out
a great way to play the psychiatrist.

720
00:49:38,093 --> 00:49:41,244
lt's fresh. With a limp. l do a great limp,

721
00:49:41,333 --> 00:49:44,211
and that will account
for his crushing insecurity.

722
00:49:44,293 --> 00:49:47,649
That way, when l make a pass at Rosalie,
l expect the rejection.

723
00:49:47,733 --> 00:49:49,928
You won't be able to play the shrink.

724
00:49:50,013 --> 00:49:52,243
- Why not?
- Steve wants a name.

725
00:49:52,333 --> 00:49:55,803
- l have a name on my driver's licence.
- He won't go with an unknown.

726
00:49:55,893 --> 00:49:59,647
- You're the director. You say what goes.
- Without him, there's no film.

727
00:49:59,733 --> 00:50:02,645
But l'm the perfect psychiatrist. You said it.

728
00:50:02,733 --> 00:50:05,725
l think l can find something else
for you in the script.

729
00:50:05,813 --> 00:50:08,088
- Like what?
- What about Moe Flanders?

730
00:50:08,173 --> 00:50:11,688
You'd be a natural.
You're more Flanders than you are the shrink.

731
00:50:11,773 --> 00:50:16,767
Flanders? The retarded elevator operator
with the cleft palate?

732
00:50:16,853 --> 00:50:20,892
- ls that how you see me?
- When have l said you had a cleft palate?

733
00:50:20,973 --> 00:50:23,931
- Help!
- My God. That's Melinda.

734
00:50:24,013 --> 00:50:27,130
He's raping her.
Probably put Novocaine in her margarita.

735
00:50:27,213 --> 00:50:30,808
- Help! Help!
- What is it? What's wrong? What's wrong?

736
00:50:30,893 --> 00:50:33,885
l got a tick! There's a tick in my leg.

737
00:50:33,973 --> 00:50:37,682
- Where's Greg?
- He's a dentist. He doesn't do tick extractions.

738
00:50:37,773 --> 00:50:40,526
His beeper went off.
He had some kind of emergency.

739
00:50:40,613 --> 00:50:43,525
Someone saw a rhino on Sixth Avenue
and they needed a hunter.

740
00:50:43,613 --> 00:50:47,401
- Get it out! Quick! Please! Please!
- l don't know how. ln the Bronx we had mice.

741
00:50:47,493 --> 00:50:51,805
You need a doctor. You can't pull it out cos
the body comes out and the head stays in.

742
00:50:51,893 --> 00:50:55,806
- l feel terrible. l think l'm gonna faint.
- Take her to the emergency room.

743
00:50:55,893 --> 00:50:59,886
- There's a tick inside me sucking my blood!
- lt's not sucking your blood.

744
00:50:59,973 --> 00:51:03,010
Those are leeches.
But this is disgusting enough.

745
00:51:31,893 --> 00:51:35,886
l'm so sorry. lt was so nice of you
to come and hang with me.

746
00:51:35,973 --> 00:51:37,372
That's OK.

747
00:51:37,453 --> 00:51:43,323
Actually, l love watching a live creature being
pulled out of somebody's body at 3.30am.

748
00:51:43,413 --> 00:51:48,806
- lf that happens again, please call me.
- lt was really nice of you - this whole day.

749
00:51:48,893 --> 00:51:51,566
lt's obvious
you don't care much for the beach.

750
00:51:51,653 --> 00:51:57,523
lt's not the beach so much as the ocean, the
sand and the seagulls and things like that.

751
00:51:57,613 --> 00:51:59,410
Well, go.

752
00:51:59,493 --> 00:52:02,053
You've had a long day. Rest.

753
00:52:02,133 --> 00:52:05,205
Call me. l'm over here if you need me. OK?

754
00:52:05,293 --> 00:52:09,491
But try not to panic.
The screaming frightened me.

755
00:52:09,573 --> 00:52:14,442
And you would be totally cool if you had a
live insect crawling around under your skin?

756
00:52:14,533 --> 00:52:16,808
l wouldn't enjoy it, but l wouldn't panic.

757
00:52:16,893 --> 00:52:20,044
That's good because
there's one in the back of your neck.

758
00:52:20,133 --> 00:52:21,725
- My neck?
- Your neck.

759
00:52:21,813 --> 00:52:23,963
- My neck?
- Yes. Right here. lt's OK.

760
00:52:24,053 --> 00:52:26,283
- Get it off! Get it off me!
- Relax. OK.

761
00:52:31,013 --> 00:52:33,925
This is exciting.
l've never been to the races before.

762
00:52:34,013 --> 00:52:38,291
Here's a horse called Broadway Melody.
l think that's a lucky name.

763
00:52:38,373 --> 00:52:44,369
Well, it's not very sensible to pick horses
by their names, but l guess it's romantic.

764
00:52:57,413 --> 00:52:59,324
That was so beautiful.

765
00:52:59,413 --> 00:53:02,610
There is no more sublime music
than that second movement.

766
00:53:02,693 --> 00:53:05,924
Laurel cannot listen without crying.
Her eyes are all red.

767
00:53:06,013 --> 00:53:10,404
l'm with her. When Raphael first laid eyes
upon the Sistine Chapel he passed out.

768
00:53:10,493 --> 00:53:13,803
- Aren't you gonna find us a taxi?
- Yeah, let's go.

769
00:53:13,893 --> 00:53:16,248
She's head over heels in love with him.

770
00:53:16,333 --> 00:53:19,689
He's gifted, sensitive.
He is unfazed by the details of her past.

771
00:53:19,773 --> 00:53:22,446
He is, in fact, moved by her suffering.

772
00:53:22,533 --> 00:53:28,165
Even the awful story she's been
reluctant to tell but feels that she must.

773
00:53:28,813 --> 00:53:31,088
l killed him.

774
00:53:31,173 --> 00:53:33,767
But it was an accident.

775
00:53:35,093 --> 00:53:36,890
No.

776
00:53:38,573 --> 00:53:42,851
ln my defence, l will say
l was out of my mind on drugs.

777
00:53:42,933 --> 00:53:45,811
l shouldn't say drugs. Pills.

778
00:53:45,893 --> 00:53:48,726
Pills to help me sleep at night,
pills to keep me awake,

779
00:53:48,813 --> 00:53:55,252
whatever l could get my hands on to sweep
my various pains and anxieties under the rug.

780
00:53:57,573 --> 00:54:01,327
But if l'm honest about it, l did mean to do it.

781
00:54:01,413 --> 00:54:03,210
No.

782
00:54:05,333 --> 00:54:08,450
l denied it in the trial, of course.

783
00:54:08,533 --> 00:54:10,922
But the fact is, l...

784
00:54:12,493 --> 00:54:15,246
l couldn't think of what else to do.

785
00:54:16,053 --> 00:54:19,090
l thought about killing myself.

786
00:54:19,173 --> 00:54:23,371
Why l didn't, l can't say.
lt would have been much more rational.

787
00:54:23,453 --> 00:54:26,923
l thought about killing his girlfriend.

788
00:54:28,613 --> 00:54:30,763
Maryanne was her name.

789
00:54:30,853 --> 00:54:32,844
Maryanne Lane.

790
00:54:35,373 --> 00:54:37,568
And it was...

791
00:54:38,613 --> 00:54:41,002
lt was so easy buying a gun.

792
00:54:42,493 --> 00:54:47,487
l just drove out of state
and l walked into a store and l bought one.

793
00:54:47,573 --> 00:54:49,370
There were no questions asked.

794
00:54:49,453 --> 00:54:56,052
l bought a box of bullets and l loaded it
like l'd been handling one my whole life.

795
00:54:57,493 --> 00:55:00,724
lt was all very premeditated,

796
00:55:02,253 --> 00:55:06,883
despite what my attorneys
would have everyone believe.

797
00:55:06,973 --> 00:55:09,362
And then l

798
00:55:09,453 --> 00:55:11,808
drove back to where he worked.

799
00:55:11,893 --> 00:55:17,251
lt was next to a Christian Science
reading room. l remember that.

800
00:55:17,333 --> 00:55:21,246
And l just waited out the front
for him to come out.

801
00:55:21,333 --> 00:55:24,484
And even that wasn't very difficult.

802
00:55:25,293 --> 00:55:30,003
There was a slight drizzle, l remember that,
but the wait wasn't interminable.

803
00:55:30,093 --> 00:55:32,084
And then

804
00:55:33,173 --> 00:55:38,247
when he came out and walked to his car,
l simply confronted him.

805
00:55:39,053 --> 00:55:43,046
And he said some
very cold and cruel things to me,

806
00:55:43,133 --> 00:55:47,331
and l shot Mr San Giuliano

807
00:55:50,413 --> 00:55:52,608
as l had planned to.

808
00:55:54,813 --> 00:55:57,008
As l had planned.

809
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:07,721
Well, they must have felt the circumstances
were extenuating if you got off so lightly.

810
00:56:07,811 --> 00:56:09,961
lt may seem lightly to you,

811
00:56:10,411 --> 00:56:12,402
but it was nothing but hell.

812
00:56:12,491 --> 00:56:18,088
And if you've never been arrested and put
on trial, well, that alone is sentence enough.

813
00:56:18,171 --> 00:56:20,446
The horror, the...

814
00:56:20,531 --> 00:56:26,925
the tension, the police, the journalists...
l went over my story hundreds of times -

815
00:56:27,011 --> 00:56:30,526
the jilted mother, seduced away
from her family, sick on drugs,

816
00:56:30,611 --> 00:56:34,081
the struggle for the gun, the gun goes off.

817
00:56:37,291 --> 00:56:39,680
But there was no struggle.

818
00:56:41,451 --> 00:56:43,760
That was legal fiction.

819
00:56:44,611 --> 00:56:47,489
Well, you had good lawyers.

820
00:56:47,571 --> 00:56:50,039
Not like your child custody team.

821
00:56:53,971 --> 00:56:58,601
l rememberjust lying
in my cell at night and thinking,

822
00:56:59,411 --> 00:57:01,402
''My God.''

823
00:57:03,331 --> 00:57:06,926
''You are Melinda Nash from Park Avenue.''

824
00:57:08,771 --> 00:57:13,640
''What the hell are you doing
in a women's prison in lllinois?''

825
00:57:15,971 --> 00:57:21,170
So, naturally, after l got out
l decided to end it all.

826
00:57:26,011 --> 00:57:28,081
What do you want?

827
00:57:32,571 --> 00:57:37,565
l want to want to live.

828
00:57:39,051 --> 00:57:41,246
Everybody wants to live.

829
00:57:47,451 --> 00:57:51,603
Now that l met you,
l'm feeling a little more positive about it.

830
00:57:52,571 --> 00:57:55,563
Congratulate me. l just got canned.

831
00:57:57,011 --> 00:58:01,562
My version differs from theirs. They would
have you believe l couldn't hold my liquor,

832
00:58:01,651 --> 00:58:05,246
which anyone who knows me
knows is a baseless canard.

833
00:58:05,331 --> 00:58:07,891
Lee, l knew this would happen.

834
00:58:08,611 --> 00:58:11,648
You did? Well, why didn't you tell me?

835
00:58:11,731 --> 00:58:14,928
l'm angry and disgusted.
l mean, Christ, can you blame them?

836
00:58:15,011 --> 00:58:19,562
Thank you for the emotional support.
l'll see you around.

837
00:58:24,091 --> 00:58:26,207
- Hey.
- Hi.

838
00:58:26,291 --> 00:58:30,762
- You all right? You seem a little glum.
- Lee got fired.

839
00:58:32,331 --> 00:58:33,810
What happened?

840
00:58:33,891 --> 00:58:36,485
lt was the producer.
They'd always wanted a name.

841
00:58:36,571 --> 00:58:40,200
- They got nervous cos ticket sales were slow.
- l'm sorry.

842
00:58:40,291 --> 00:58:44,250
- l know the realities of the marketplace.
- Yeah. So, what are you gonna do?

843
00:58:44,331 --> 00:58:48,643
l don't know if l should feel sorry for myself
or shop to blot out my depression.

844
00:58:48,731 --> 00:58:50,528
- Neither. Come with us.
- With you?

845
00:58:50,611 --> 00:58:54,286
Sure. l'm taking Melinda
to a recording session. Bartk.

846
00:58:54,371 --> 00:58:56,441
- No...
- lt'll take your mind off things.

847
00:58:56,531 --> 00:59:00,490
- You love Bartk. They're doing a quartet.
- You remembered?

848
00:59:00,571 --> 00:59:03,608
- Come on.
- Do l have time to change?

849
00:59:03,691 --> 00:59:07,445
- You look fine. Look at me.
- l feel so grungy. l've been working all day.

850
00:59:07,531 --> 00:59:11,729
- All right, but hurry, then we'll get a coffee.
- OK.

851
00:59:35,331 --> 00:59:38,403
- lt's beautiful, isn't it?
- They're so good.

852
00:59:38,491 --> 00:59:43,326
l could never decide between the piano and
the cello. The result is l play them both badly.

853
00:59:43,411 --> 00:59:46,608
- And the viola.
- l heard you play the piano. You're good.

854
00:59:46,691 --> 00:59:47,726
- No.
- Yes.

855
00:59:47,811 --> 00:59:51,599
Full of feeling.
You have a lovely touch of the keys.

856
00:59:51,691 --> 00:59:55,047
l can see a person's soul
by their intonation on an instrument -

857
00:59:55,131 --> 00:59:58,487
- keyboard, horn or strings. l can. lt's a gift.
- You saw my soul?

858
00:59:58,571 --> 01:00:02,849
Right off the bat. That first party,
when you sat down next to me to play,

859
01:00:02,931 --> 01:00:07,209
the minute you touched the keys
the chord went through me like a knife.

860
01:00:07,291 --> 01:00:09,964
l don't dare ask you what you saw.

861
01:00:12,411 --> 01:00:15,005
lt's great.

862
01:00:15,091 --> 01:00:19,881
Although l find
the more turbulent parts a little scary.

863
01:00:23,931 --> 01:00:26,491
- He's still not home.
- Come to dinner with us.

864
01:00:26,571 --> 01:00:29,131
- No, l can't.
- Come on. lt's gonna be fun.

865
01:00:29,211 --> 01:00:34,888
We'll go down to this little bistro downtown
west. lt's very quiet, very dark, very French.

866
01:00:34,971 --> 01:00:40,284
- l haven't been to a dark bistro since college.
- You'll love it. l've fallen in love there.

867
01:00:40,611 --> 01:00:42,488
No more for me.

868
01:00:42,571 --> 01:00:45,404
- Melinda was the fast, advanced one.
- Come on.

869
01:00:45,491 --> 01:00:48,688
All the men were crazy for her.
They were drawn to her.

870
01:00:48,771 --> 01:00:50,887
Her unpredictability.

871
01:00:50,971 --> 01:00:53,280
No, Laurel was the star of our group.

872
01:00:53,371 --> 01:00:56,727
l remember how jealous everyone was
when you married Lee.

873
01:00:56,811 --> 01:01:00,008
Lee was the most attractive,
most charismatic actor.

874
01:01:00,091 --> 01:01:06,166
My God. You almost broke Cassie's heart,
not that she'd ever admit it.

875
01:01:06,251 --> 01:01:11,200
Forgive me. Am l being too open here?
lt's just l feel great.

876
01:01:11,291 --> 01:01:13,566
- What is this?
- lt's a Haut-Brion.

877
01:01:13,651 --> 01:01:17,087
My head is swimming. But it feels good.

878
01:01:17,171 --> 01:01:22,006
You were the first one in our group to sleep
with a man. You were so very sophisticated.

879
01:01:22,091 --> 01:01:26,562
- l admired it. l did.
- Yeah, well, it was probably true.

880
01:01:26,651 --> 01:01:32,442
- l had a deep hunger for physical intimacy.
- A hunger that could not be denied.

881
01:01:32,531 --> 01:01:36,160
Not once adolescence descended
and the hormones kicked in.

882
01:01:36,251 --> 01:01:40,722
Melinda had a reputation
for being postmodern in bed.

883
01:01:40,811 --> 01:01:46,727
Life is short. That was a sobering discovery
l made when my mother killed herself.

884
01:01:46,811 --> 01:01:52,807
Short, and not about anything except
what you can touch and what touches you.

885
01:01:54,171 --> 01:01:56,162
Whereas l...

886
01:01:57,011 --> 01:02:00,162
l've only made love with one man in my life.

887
01:02:00,251 --> 01:02:03,926
Lee was the first
and Lee was the whole story ever since.

888
01:02:04,011 --> 01:02:06,889
That's perfect. No, l mean it.

889
01:02:06,971 --> 01:02:11,601
l think there's something almost mystical
about two people who only know each other.

890
01:02:11,691 --> 01:02:14,046
And, really, you're both very alike.

891
01:02:14,131 --> 01:02:17,601
You know, you're both very,
very passionate women.

892
01:02:17,691 --> 01:02:22,481
You're poured into one person, and you've
wanted to live out different experiences.

893
01:02:24,411 --> 01:02:27,130
- ls that you?
- No.

894
01:02:27,211 --> 01:02:29,600
No, l think it's me.

895
01:02:32,331 --> 01:02:34,322
So, l got a message.

896
01:02:36,451 --> 01:02:40,524
That was Peter.
l think he's got some news about my children.

897
01:02:41,531 --> 01:02:45,126
- Would you excuse me for a minute?
- Yeah, go ahead.

898
01:02:53,771 --> 01:02:56,683
l was determined not to ask you

899
01:02:56,771 --> 01:03:01,049
what you saw when you looked
right through to my soul when we met.

900
01:03:01,131 --> 01:03:02,928
But l wanna know.

901
01:03:03,451 --> 01:03:05,646
Something very clouded

902
01:03:06,731 --> 01:03:08,403
and

903
01:03:08,491 --> 01:03:11,164
protective,

904
01:03:11,251 --> 01:03:14,084
with lots of longing. There was...

905
01:03:14,171 --> 01:03:18,642
Wow, there was a great longing
in the notes you played.

906
01:03:19,531 --> 01:03:25,208
That's as accurate a diagnosis as a shrink
would make. lt took you a much shorter time.

907
01:03:25,291 --> 01:03:27,361
You sat down and pressed the keyboard,

908
01:03:27,451 --> 01:03:32,525
and l thought, ''Who is this lovely creature
with the melancholy touch on the keyboard?''

909
01:03:32,611 --> 01:03:37,207
Then l saw your wedding ring,
and l thought, you know, story of my life.

910
01:03:37,771 --> 01:03:39,966
ls that the story of your life?

911
01:03:40,411 --> 01:03:43,050
Well, it's the main chapters.

912
01:03:44,451 --> 01:03:46,521
My first impression was,

913
01:03:46,611 --> 01:03:48,522
he's handsome,

914
01:03:48,611 --> 01:03:50,522
he's lost,

915
01:03:50,611 --> 01:03:53,079
he's got inscrutable eyes...

916
01:03:53,931 --> 01:03:56,684
Melinda would like him.

917
01:03:57,891 --> 01:03:59,927
Speaking of Melinda.

918
01:04:02,291 --> 01:04:05,886
l don't dare say this, but it looks hopeful.

919
01:04:07,411 --> 01:04:09,766
God.

920
01:04:09,851 --> 01:04:12,968
l almost wish this opportunity
hadn't come up, you know.

921
01:04:13,051 --> 01:04:16,407
l just don't know
if l can handle the tension.

922
01:04:16,491 --> 01:04:18,561
l mean...

923
01:04:18,651 --> 01:04:23,167
- Just say it doesn't work out.
- lt will. You have to think positively.

924
01:04:23,251 --> 01:04:28,166
She's right. You were correct when you said
that life is short and not about anything,

925
01:04:28,251 --> 01:04:33,883
but one thing l do know is that we were not
put on this Earth to be dragged all the time.

926
01:04:35,451 --> 01:04:37,726
We should go.

927
01:04:37,811 --> 01:04:42,202
l was hoping that you could come by my
class one afternoon and lecture the students.

928
01:04:42,291 --> 01:04:46,125
- lt would be so meaningful to them.
- l'd love to.

929
01:04:46,211 --> 01:04:50,727
l'm a good lecturer. l just hope
l'm not a better lecturer than a composer.

930
01:04:55,131 --> 01:04:58,646
- You're home.
- l'm sorry, Laurel.

931
01:04:58,731 --> 01:05:00,847
l really messed things up.

932
01:05:00,931 --> 01:05:04,640
Yes, well, you really have
to get a handle on your drinking.

933
01:05:04,731 --> 01:05:07,370
Yes. And l will.

934
01:05:07,451 --> 01:05:10,045
Of course, now the boat sailed.

935
01:05:11,771 --> 01:05:14,968
- Made you some dinner.
- l ate.

936
01:05:15,051 --> 01:05:17,929
Where were you?

937
01:05:18,011 --> 01:05:20,889
l had some late meetings at school.

938
01:05:37,451 --> 01:05:40,409
- l don't know what to do.
- And you're sure?

939
01:05:40,491 --> 01:05:44,643
- Yes. lt was there in his talk, in his eyes.
- And you flirted back?

940
01:05:44,731 --> 01:05:48,041
Yes. l was outta control,
letting him know l was there for him.

941
01:05:48,131 --> 01:05:50,087
God. Poor Melinda.

942
01:05:50,171 --> 01:05:54,483
l don't wanna hear about poor Melinda.
Other people's lives are falling apart.

943
01:05:54,571 --> 01:05:58,007
Peter and l suspected
it was not going well with Lee.

944
01:05:58,091 --> 01:06:01,288
Does everyone? Am l gossiped about?

945
01:06:01,371 --> 01:06:03,441
God, that poor girl.

946
01:06:03,531 --> 01:06:07,160
- Don't worry. l'm not gonna do anything.
- You already have.

947
01:06:07,251 --> 01:06:10,880
lf you get divorced, there'll be lots of men.
Peter and l can help.

948
01:06:10,971 --> 01:06:16,045
No. l'm not gonna be the pathetic single
friend getting introduced to some dentist.

949
01:06:16,131 --> 01:06:18,929
You're gonna act on this. l see it.

950
01:06:22,691 --> 01:06:25,967
l don't know what to do.
l can't stop thinking about Melinda.

951
01:06:26,051 --> 01:06:29,441
She just knocked on our door
carrying her neurosis in her arms.

952
01:06:29,531 --> 01:06:32,603
- Now l can't get her out of my mind.
- Come on. You're married.

953
01:06:32,691 --> 01:06:38,448
l know. l know that. l'm consumed with guilt.
l dream of myself kissing Melinda.

954
01:06:38,531 --> 01:06:41,807
- Then l'm on trial at Nuremberg.
- How does Melinda feel?

955
01:06:41,891 --> 01:06:46,328
l haven't been able to tell her that.
The subject of infidelity's out of the question.

956
01:06:46,411 --> 01:06:49,369
- You don't know if she feels the same?
- No, l think she does.

957
01:06:49,451 --> 01:06:53,285
l just haven't had a chance to pursue it.
l mean, Walt, here's the thing.

958
01:06:53,371 --> 01:06:56,249
My marriage has been on the decline
for a long time.

959
01:06:56,331 --> 01:06:58,606
We hardly ever sleep together.

960
01:06:58,691 --> 01:07:02,684
The last time we did
Susan just lay there staring into the darkness

961
01:07:02,771 --> 01:07:05,763
as if her parents had been killed in a fire.

962
01:07:05,851 --> 01:07:09,890
Well, why can't you just tell her
it's not working any more?

963
01:07:09,971 --> 01:07:15,284
l don't wanna hurt her. l couldn't fire my
podiatrist who operated on my wrong foot.

964
01:07:15,371 --> 01:07:17,726
Maybe you should go back to your shrink.

965
01:07:17,811 --> 01:07:21,406
He'd just recommend Prozac.
l think he has stock in the company.

966
01:07:21,491 --> 01:07:24,449
- Maybe you're using Susan as an excuse.
- No.

967
01:07:24,531 --> 01:07:27,603
Yes. Maybe you don't even really wanna do it.

968
01:07:27,691 --> 01:07:32,890
No, cos if there was a button l could push to
be with Melinda but not hurt Susan, l'd do it.

969
01:07:32,971 --> 01:07:37,442
Tell me this. How wise is it to get involved
with a woman with Melinda's track record?

970
01:07:37,531 --> 01:07:42,321
That's why l'm convinced l'm in love with her,
because there's no logical reason to be.

971
01:07:42,411 --> 01:07:45,209
- Be a man. Be honest with Susan.
- l don't know...

972
01:07:45,291 --> 01:07:49,079
That's what you have to do!
Be honest with her. She'll live, you'll live.

973
01:07:49,171 --> 01:07:52,481
Then you go out,
you buy Melinda a nice little bauble -

974
01:07:52,571 --> 01:07:54,721
l heard her say that she likes Art Deco -

975
01:07:54,811 --> 01:07:58,167
- take her out, confess your feelings.
- You sure?

976
01:07:58,251 --> 01:08:02,324
- Yeah. That's the way.
- This is gonna crush Susan.

977
01:08:15,451 --> 01:08:19,205
How you doin'?
The Deco pin there.

978
01:08:19,291 --> 01:08:21,327
- How much is that?
- That's $150.

979
01:08:21,411 --> 01:08:25,484
- Could you giftwrap that for me?
- Yes, of course.

980
01:08:41,691 --> 01:08:46,162
l wish l could be with Melinda
without hurting my wife.

981
01:09:14,611 --> 01:09:19,241
- Hobie, what are you doing here?
- Now, don't get upset.

982
01:09:19,331 --> 01:09:25,327
Hobie, l think you should know that Steve
and l have become attracted to one another.

983
01:09:26,491 --> 01:09:30,564
- You have?
- lf you punch me in the nose, l'd understand.

984
01:09:30,651 --> 01:09:33,563
He came here to be with me while l told you.

985
01:09:33,651 --> 01:09:36,927
You have to admit,
things have run out of steam between us.

986
01:09:37,011 --> 01:09:39,923
l just... Try to understand.

987
01:09:40,011 --> 01:09:41,842
l do.

988
01:09:41,931 --> 01:09:45,924
l think we've been drifting a...
Wait. You do understand?

989
01:09:46,011 --> 01:09:48,764
l do. Most definitely.

990
01:09:48,851 --> 01:09:54,050
You're having an affair with Steve Walsh.
He's wonderful. He's clever.

991
01:09:54,131 --> 01:09:57,680
He's smart. He's fabulously wealthy.

992
01:09:58,131 --> 01:10:02,124
l know. l just want you to know
l don't want anything.

993
01:10:02,211 --> 01:10:05,009
l know how tough
your work has been for you,

994
01:10:05,091 --> 01:10:09,050
and we've decided Steve
is just gonna help with all the legal expenses,

995
01:10:09,131 --> 01:10:13,602
and l just want everything to be
as painless and as civilised as possible.

996
01:10:13,691 --> 01:10:17,843
You know, l think that
we can always be friends.

997
01:10:18,291 --> 01:10:21,681
Melinda. Hobie.
Can you meet me for a few minutes?

998
01:10:21,771 --> 01:10:25,127
There's something l'm dying to tell you
when you get off work.

999
01:10:25,211 --> 01:10:28,647
You know that little French bistro
on the corner of Tenth Avenue?

1000
01:10:28,731 --> 01:10:31,564
The little candlelightjoint,
near where you work.

1001
01:10:37,331 --> 01:10:42,007
Are you sure you should be drinking
so much without having any lunch?

1002
01:10:42,091 --> 01:10:47,211
Well, we worked through lunch.
l was doing a voice-over commercial.

1003
01:10:47,291 --> 01:10:50,920
lt's not what l envisioned
when l was at Northwestern.

1004
01:10:51,011 --> 01:10:55,243
They still talk about
my portrayal of King Lear.

1005
01:10:55,331 --> 01:10:57,765
l played it with a limp.

1006
01:10:59,611 --> 01:11:02,284
How are you liking the job at the gallery?

1007
01:11:02,971 --> 01:11:05,769
Well, my boss is great.

1008
01:11:05,851 --> 01:11:08,649
- She has amazing taste.
- Good.

1009
01:11:09,491 --> 01:11:12,961
l mean, it's not a very high-paying job,
but it's fantastic

1010
01:11:13,051 --> 01:11:17,169
cos l have plenty of time
to think about what l wanna do with my life.

1011
01:11:17,251 --> 01:11:19,640
Well, l'm glad you said that.

1012
01:11:20,851 --> 01:11:26,084
God, you look very pretty in this candlelight.

1013
01:11:27,211 --> 01:11:31,841
l'm sure anyone would look amazing
with all this flickering shadows

1014
01:11:31,931 --> 01:11:34,081
and all the wine you're drinking.

1015
01:11:34,171 --> 01:11:37,880
Right. Right. Well, l'm drinking

1016
01:11:37,971 --> 01:11:41,008
because life moves so fast.

1017
01:11:41,091 --> 01:11:43,286
So unpredictably.

1018
01:11:43,371 --> 01:11:46,886
You know, it's over so fast
and in the end, what is it?

1019
01:11:46,971 --> 01:11:49,280
Chekhov said a soap bubble.

1020
01:11:50,491 --> 01:11:53,927
Did l tell you l played Uncle Vanya once?

1021
01:11:54,011 --> 01:11:56,809
With a limp. lt was interesting.

1022
01:11:58,891 --> 01:12:04,568
You know, it's funny
that you should say ''unpredictable'',

1023
01:12:04,651 --> 01:12:08,246
because l was walking home yesterday.

1024
01:12:08,331 --> 01:12:10,686
l have to tell you this story.

1025
01:12:10,771 --> 01:12:14,400
So, some people were moving
into an apartment on 90th Street.

1026
01:12:14,491 --> 01:12:18,609
And they were moving this piano,
so there was this piano just, you know,

1027
01:12:18,691 --> 01:12:21,080
sitting in the middle of the sidewalk.

1028
01:12:21,171 --> 01:12:26,609
And l couldn't resist the temptation
just to go up and give it a little tinkle.

1029
01:12:26,691 --> 01:12:29,683
l play a little piano.
l used to play in high school.

1030
01:12:29,771 --> 01:12:33,002
l actually gave some concerts.

1031
01:12:33,091 --> 01:12:38,961
Anyway, l'm playing this piano. l'm playing
this little tune that my mother taught me.

1032
01:12:39,051 --> 01:12:41,360
And this...

1033
01:12:41,451 --> 01:12:43,601
this guy came up

1034
01:12:43,691 --> 01:12:46,080
and started talking to me.

1035
01:12:51,931 --> 01:12:53,922
- Hi.
- Hi.

1036
01:12:58,251 --> 01:13:00,242
That's good.

1037
01:13:01,131 --> 01:13:03,929
- You play the melody.
- All right.

1038
01:13:08,691 --> 01:13:11,285
ls that what you're trying for?

1039
01:13:12,971 --> 01:13:15,360
- Exactly.
- Good.

1040
01:13:16,811 --> 01:13:19,883
So, his name is Billy Wheeler,

1041
01:13:19,971 --> 01:13:22,280
and he's a piano player.

1042
01:13:22,371 --> 01:13:25,010
And he also writes pretty music.

1043
01:13:25,091 --> 01:13:29,562
And he walked me back to my apartment
and he invited me out on a date.

1044
01:13:29,651 --> 01:13:31,926
And

1045
01:13:32,011 --> 01:13:34,571
l think l'm in love.

1046
01:13:35,371 --> 01:13:38,761
- ln love?
- Well, l mean, l'm exaggerating, of course,

1047
01:13:38,851 --> 01:13:42,207
but some bell definitely went off.

1048
01:13:42,651 --> 01:13:46,166
- A bell?
- One of those bells that now and then rings,

1049
01:13:46,251 --> 01:13:52,599
as Mr Cole Porter put it. So, anyway, l just
thought that you would be pleased to know.

1050
01:13:52,691 --> 01:13:55,159
So, what is it that you wanted to tell me?

1051
01:13:59,491 --> 01:14:02,642
l don't... lt doesn't matter.

1052
01:14:02,731 --> 01:14:09,603
OK. This situation is perfect -
he's despondent, he's desperate, he's suicidal.

1053
01:14:10,051 --> 01:14:12,929
All the comic elements are in place.

1054
01:14:13,011 --> 01:14:18,244
Now she's going out with Billy Wheeler,
and Hobie's the single upstairs neighbour.

1055
01:14:18,331 --> 01:14:20,287
Now she's fixing him up.

1056
01:14:20,371 --> 01:14:22,362
We must know somebody for Hobie.

1057
01:14:22,451 --> 01:14:25,329
- The woman who owns your art gallery?
- Phoebe's married.

1058
01:14:25,411 --> 01:14:28,926
l don't need to meet anyone.
l'm fine just staying in my room and...

1059
01:14:29,011 --> 01:14:31,650
And what? Moping?

1060
01:14:31,731 --> 01:14:35,326
Get out and reinvest your emotion.
Don't indulge your depression.

1061
01:14:35,411 --> 01:14:39,040
- Hey. Stacey Fox. Why not?
- Who?

1062
01:14:39,131 --> 01:14:43,522
She recently broke up with some Wall
Street guy. She's bright and great-looking.

1063
01:14:43,611 --> 01:14:45,727
- What does she do?
- lnvestment.

1064
01:14:45,811 --> 01:14:49,599
One of those business suits
who makes love to you on a conference call.

1065
01:14:49,691 --> 01:14:55,641
She's no stereotype. She posed for a feature
for <i>Playboy</i> on naked political conservatives.

1066
01:14:55,731 --> 01:15:00,168
Well, uh, l don't know if that's his type.
She's probably got augmented cleavage.

1067
01:15:00,251 --> 01:15:03,527
She's anybody's type. Come on.
Wednesday's Halloween.

1068
01:15:03,611 --> 01:15:07,286
We were gonna go out. You should
meet Stacey. l think she just broke up.

1069
01:15:07,371 --> 01:15:12,286
Hobie agrees to being fixed up,
but he's still madly in love with Melinda.

1070
01:15:12,371 --> 01:15:16,728
He dreams about her all the time.
He's consumed with jealousy.

1071
01:15:16,811 --> 01:15:21,327
He can't bear the thought that she might
be making love with another man.

1072
01:15:21,411 --> 01:15:25,290
He wants to know!
But he doesn't wanna know.

1073
01:15:25,371 --> 01:15:27,760
lt's driving him crazy.

1074
01:15:38,771 --> 01:15:42,320
Did you hear something?
l heard something at the front.

1075
01:15:42,411 --> 01:15:46,484
Can you just go check the door?
Make sure it's locked.

1076
01:16:44,331 --> 01:16:48,085
- What is it? What's the matter?
- l need to talk to you.

1077
01:16:48,171 --> 01:16:50,969
You look terrible. What happened?

1078
01:16:51,051 --> 01:16:54,680
l think Laurel and Ellis are having an affair.

1079
01:16:54,771 --> 01:16:57,160
What?

1080
01:16:57,251 --> 01:17:00,004
l'm going crazy. l just...

1081
01:17:00,091 --> 01:17:02,810
- Take it easy, will you?
- l don't know what to do.

1082
01:17:02,891 --> 01:17:05,849
- Well, what makes you think so?
- l just know it, OK?

1083
01:17:05,931 --> 01:17:10,368
l've been through this once before.
Laurel is supposed to be my closest friend.

1084
01:17:10,451 --> 01:17:15,320
But what makes you think
that something's going on?

1085
01:17:15,411 --> 01:17:20,439
l thought it was my paranoia. Then last week
l was coming home from house hunting.

1086
01:17:20,531 --> 01:17:27,050
Ellis was out of town. And l overheard
this argument between Laurel and Lee.

1087
01:17:27,491 --> 01:17:30,005
- What's this?
- What?

1088
01:17:30,091 --> 01:17:32,730
Whose key is this? Who's A?

1089
01:17:32,811 --> 01:17:34,244
A?

1090
01:17:34,331 --> 01:17:36,606
Whose keys are in our bathroom?
Who was here?

1091
01:17:36,691 --> 01:17:38,682
l don't know.

1092
01:17:39,771 --> 01:17:42,604
- You were with someone.
- Laurel.

1093
01:17:42,691 --> 01:17:45,842
- You had a woman here!
- l can't listen to these accusations.

1094
01:17:45,931 --> 01:17:48,399
- You slept with someone here?
- Leave me alone.

1095
01:17:48,491 --> 01:17:51,403
l can't get into another
big discussion of my life.

1096
01:17:51,491 --> 01:17:55,530
Just because l was up here with someone
talking, doesn't mean we went to bed.

1097
01:17:55,611 --> 01:17:57,681
l am finished with this, Lee.

1098
01:17:57,771 --> 01:18:00,649
- You're a fine one to talk.
- What does that mean?

1099
01:18:00,731 --> 01:18:04,201
You'd love to call it quits
now your eye's on someone else.

1100
01:18:04,291 --> 01:18:08,079
- What?
- You throw yourself at Melinda's boyfriend.

1101
01:18:08,171 --> 01:18:12,323
- Don't try and turn this around!
- l'm amazed she tolerates it.

1102
01:18:12,411 --> 01:18:14,879
You're mixing things up cos you were caught.

1103
01:18:14,971 --> 01:18:18,930
No, you were caught. l know you
when you slip into your seductive mode.

1104
01:18:19,011 --> 01:18:23,766
- l'm not gonna have this stupid conversation!
- Don't worry, l won't be around much longer.

1105
01:18:23,851 --> 01:18:26,604
And then you can feel free
to pursue whoever you want!

1106
01:18:26,691 --> 01:18:29,763
From that moment, the demons set in.

1107
01:18:29,851 --> 01:18:33,890
l just couldn't sleep.
Doesn't matter how many pills l take.

1108
01:18:33,971 --> 01:18:39,523
l just feel myself consumed with suspicion
and l'm ashamed of it.

1109
01:18:39,611 --> 01:18:40,600
Melinda...

1110
01:18:40,691 --> 01:18:43,603
Cassie, you know it's true.
l can see it in your face.

1111
01:18:43,691 --> 01:18:47,400
Look, you have to pull yourself together.
You've been popping pills.

1112
01:18:47,491 --> 01:18:50,563
- You've been drinking...
- Stop avoiding answering me.

1113
01:18:50,651 --> 01:18:53,484
l don't know anything.

1114
01:18:53,571 --> 01:18:59,089
l called Ellis today. He's not where
he said he'd be, so l called Laurel's school.

1115
01:18:59,171 --> 01:19:02,846
She'd called in sick.
Clearly, she's not home sick.

1116
01:19:02,931 --> 01:19:07,925
Listen, even if your worst fears were true,
you can'tjust go off the deep end.

1117
01:19:09,811 --> 01:19:15,602
l pick up the phone extension. l have to know.
At the same time, l don't wanna know.

1118
01:19:15,691 --> 01:19:18,763
Listen, you cannot
give yourself over to fantasies.

1119
01:19:18,851 --> 01:19:23,049
Let's find out the reality first,
and stop drinking.

1120
01:19:23,131 --> 01:19:25,486
For God's sakes, it's not even noon yet.

1121
01:19:25,571 --> 01:19:29,484
God. l have an appointment
with your husband at noon.

1122
01:19:29,571 --> 01:19:31,641
Well, you're gonna be late.

1123
01:19:32,451 --> 01:19:34,840
l'm afraid the news is not good.

1124
01:19:39,571 --> 01:19:40,845
No?

1125
01:19:40,931 --> 01:19:47,245
My partner gave it everything he had, but the
politics of the situation is just too difficult.

1126
01:19:47,331 --> 01:19:49,765
Your ex-husband is very well connected

1127
01:19:49,851 --> 01:19:53,526
and very determined
to keep the children from you.

1128
01:19:53,611 --> 01:19:57,809
Naturally, the criminal conviction didn't help.

1129
01:19:59,051 --> 01:20:02,680
lt's funny. l steeled myself for this result,

1130
01:20:02,771 --> 01:20:06,161
but now that it's come...

1131
01:20:06,971 --> 01:20:12,170
You know, l know this will sound
very Pollyanna, but it's true.

1132
01:20:12,251 --> 01:20:17,689
When they grow up, they will want to know
who their mother was and get to know you.

1133
01:20:17,771 --> 01:20:22,162
My guess is they'll be quite angry
at their father for his unreasonableness.

1134
01:20:22,251 --> 01:20:25,687
You'll see. They'll grow up and come to you.

1135
01:20:28,451 --> 01:20:31,090
Well, l'm certain that they will.

1136
01:20:31,171 --> 01:20:36,768
l'm sure that they'll take after me
and look very much like my mother.

1137
01:20:36,851 --> 01:20:38,887
My mother

1138
01:20:38,971 --> 01:20:43,249
was a very gifted interior decorator.

1139
01:20:43,331 --> 01:20:48,166
And l studied art,
so l've always had this flair for graphics.

1140
01:20:48,251 --> 01:20:50,606
Can l get you anything?

1141
01:20:52,131 --> 01:20:56,363
No, l just hope that you'll be
sending some of your clients to me

1142
01:20:56,451 --> 01:20:59,648
when l get more established, you know.

1143
01:21:01,411 --> 01:21:05,643
Did l tell you that my mother... my mother...

1144
01:21:05,731 --> 01:21:10,566
my mother was
a very gifted interior decorator?

1145
01:21:10,651 --> 01:21:16,044
She was very talented. She did some
amazing houses on the Upper West Side.

1146
01:21:50,411 --> 01:21:52,925
Melinda...

1147
01:21:53,011 --> 01:21:56,321
There's been no easy way
to handle this situation.

1148
01:22:10,851 --> 01:22:13,649
l think we need to talk.

1149
01:22:15,531 --> 01:22:19,729
No, these situations are never easy.

1150
01:22:21,211 --> 01:22:23,361
l'm sorry, Melinda.

1151
01:22:23,451 --> 01:22:26,409
l really am sorry. lt's just...

1152
01:22:26,491 --> 01:22:32,760
We planned to tell you, but each of us
was so bewildered as how to approach it.

1153
01:22:33,411 --> 01:22:35,845
Bewildered.

1154
01:22:35,931 --> 01:22:38,684
lt's not like we planned on it happening.

1155
01:22:38,771 --> 01:22:45,210
We were going to explain things
as soon as we figured out the best approach.

1156
01:22:45,291 --> 01:22:50,319
- l loved you.
- l don't have a satisfying explanation.

1157
01:22:50,411 --> 01:22:53,403
You know, these things happen.

1158
01:22:54,651 --> 01:22:56,528
Living is messy.

1159
01:22:59,131 --> 01:23:01,599
My head is spinning.

1160
01:23:01,691 --> 01:23:04,444
l need to lie down and rest.

1161
01:23:04,531 --> 01:23:07,250
l wanna close my eyes

1162
01:23:07,331 --> 01:23:09,720
and never open them again.

1163
01:23:12,891 --> 01:23:15,485
- l'm going out the window.
- Ellis.

1164
01:23:16,651 --> 01:23:19,848
Meli... What are you doing?

1165
01:23:19,931 --> 01:23:21,922
l'm going out!

1166
01:23:27,971 --> 01:23:29,882
Cassie?

1167
01:23:29,971 --> 01:23:33,043
Melinda has to come
and stay with you for a while.

1168
01:23:33,131 --> 01:23:35,201
No, there is no other answer.

1169
01:23:35,291 --> 01:23:40,206
She has to be watched, and it's awkward
with me and Ellis under the circumstances.

1170
01:23:40,291 --> 01:23:42,600
Well, l can't be responsible either.

1171
01:23:42,691 --> 01:23:47,765
Let's face it, Cassie. She's one of those people
who will always need help.

1172
01:23:47,851 --> 01:23:51,924
lt's sad, but we have to
move on with our lives.

1173
01:24:00,051 --> 01:24:04,727
You killed her.
You killed her as l am about to kill you.

1174
01:24:19,131 --> 01:24:21,122
Come, Vitus.

1175
01:24:25,411 --> 01:24:28,005
Are we men or are we children?

1176
01:24:28,931 --> 01:24:31,286
- Of what use...
- So, what do you think?

1177
01:24:31,371 --> 01:24:35,125
She's gorgeous. Hard to believe
a Republican could be that sexual.

1178
01:24:35,211 --> 01:24:38,806
l bet she could put your portfolio in order.

1179
01:24:55,811 --> 01:25:01,681
- l thought you didn't like to dance.
- l'm just trying to be a good sport.

1180
01:25:12,211 --> 01:25:17,046
l think it'd only be fair
to tell you, l'm a liberal.

1181
01:25:17,131 --> 01:25:19,884
Are you talking politically
or in the bedroom?

1182
01:25:19,971 --> 01:25:25,967
l was talking politically.
ln the bedroom, l'm a left-wing liberal.

1183
01:25:26,051 --> 01:25:28,849
ln the bedroom, l'm a radical.

1184
01:25:30,131 --> 01:25:32,486
Look, can l level with you?

1185
01:25:32,571 --> 01:25:36,928
ln the past few months of my marriage
l really didn't sleep with my wife.

1186
01:25:37,011 --> 01:25:39,081
We weren't sleeping at all.

1187
01:25:39,171 --> 01:25:41,890
l... So it's,... you know.

1188
01:25:41,971 --> 01:25:44,360
l'm a little out of practice.

1189
01:25:44,451 --> 01:25:49,286
Politically speaking,
l'm ready for a little affirmative action.

1190
01:25:49,371 --> 01:25:52,727
What do you say we blow this joint
and go back to your place?

1191
01:25:52,811 --> 01:25:57,885
My place? Yes, by all means.
lt'd be great. This is like a drea...

1192
01:25:57,971 --> 01:26:02,044
So you're not gonna hold the fact
that we have conflicting viewpoints

1193
01:26:02,131 --> 01:26:04,929
on the direction America should take
against me?

1194
01:26:05,011 --> 01:26:09,084
l mean, l'd hate to get all worked up
and then we find we differ on a tax cut.

1195
01:26:09,171 --> 01:26:12,959
Come on.
l haven't made love in a while either.

1196
01:26:14,131 --> 01:26:17,840
Yes. l will never vote
against school prayer again.

1197
01:26:32,131 --> 01:26:35,806
- Hey, what are they up to?
- What do you think?

1198
01:26:39,611 --> 01:26:42,683
- So much dancing.
- That was so much fun.

1199
01:26:44,011 --> 01:26:46,002
You'll have to forgive the disarray.

1200
01:26:46,091 --> 01:26:51,040
My cleaning woman won $168 million
in the lottery and she asked for the day off.

1201
01:26:51,131 --> 01:26:54,328
- Ajoke.
- You must get depressed sleeping alone.

1202
01:26:54,411 --> 01:26:58,689
The truth is, l frighten myself. l'm always
worried burglars are gonna break in.

1203
01:26:58,771 --> 01:27:03,287
- l bought a baseball bat. Oh, drinks.
- l know the feeling of being dumped.

1204
01:27:03,371 --> 01:27:07,046
Except in my case,
it was between my fianc and my best friend.

1205
01:27:07,131 --> 01:27:09,087
- No!
- Yes.

1206
01:27:09,171 --> 01:27:13,767
l'd known her all my life. We were school
mates. We went through everything together.

1207
01:27:13,851 --> 01:27:17,048
She was the one who was responsible
for my meeting my fianc.

1208
01:27:17,131 --> 01:27:19,691
lt's a sad story. lt's awful.

1209
01:27:19,771 --> 01:27:23,844
Do you mind sleeping on cotton sheets?
l know you posed for <i>Playboy</i> on satin.

1210
01:27:23,931 --> 01:27:27,765
l couldn't help noticing
how they'd always make eye contact.

1211
01:27:27,851 --> 01:27:31,730
l thought l was paranoid,
but l should have trusted my instinct.

1212
01:27:31,811 --> 01:27:33,802
Always go with your gut feeling.

1213
01:27:33,891 --> 01:27:39,761
Sometimes l would pick up the phone
after it would ring, and there'd be no one.

1214
01:27:39,851 --> 01:27:42,923
- But they were signalling each other.
- Stacey.

1215
01:27:43,011 --> 01:27:46,481
Making love, meeting secretly,
laughing at me...

1216
01:27:46,571 --> 01:27:50,530
- l'm sure they weren't laughing at you.
- We were moving in together.

1217
01:27:50,611 --> 01:27:54,490
Looking for an apartment together,
to live together. l loved him.

1218
01:27:54,571 --> 01:27:56,766
- l'm sure.
- My closest friend knew that.

1219
01:27:56,851 --> 01:28:01,049
She knew how much l cared about him. She
knew my whole life was wrapped up in him.

1220
01:28:01,131 --> 01:28:05,249
Of course. Should l dim the lights?
Maybe a little jazz. Do you like jazz?

1221
01:28:05,331 --> 01:28:09,119
- l can't bear it. l can't bear to think about it.
- Don't think about it.

1222
01:28:09,211 --> 01:28:13,568
You know, life is so rotten, so cruel,
and then, finally, about nothing.

1223
01:28:13,651 --> 01:28:16,245
We can just stretch out on the carpet if you...

1224
01:28:16,331 --> 01:28:19,004
l can't stand it!
l'm going out the window.

1225
01:28:19,091 --> 01:28:20,160
What?

1226
01:28:20,251 --> 01:28:25,245
- l'm going out the window.
- Stacey, wait! Are you crazy?

1227
01:28:25,331 --> 01:28:26,730
Stacey...

1228
01:28:26,811 --> 01:28:28,563
Stacey.

1229
01:28:28,651 --> 01:28:31,688
- Leave me alone. l wanna end it all!
- No, no, no!

1230
01:28:31,771 --> 01:28:34,160
- Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
- Please!

1231
01:28:34,251 --> 01:28:36,640
Let's talk about what...

1232
01:28:38,411 --> 01:28:40,129
Jeez.

1233
01:28:40,211 --> 01:28:41,405
God!

1234
01:28:41,491 --> 01:28:43,402
Please, let me go.

1235
01:28:43,491 --> 01:28:45,083
Let me go!

1236
01:28:45,851 --> 01:28:49,287
Kiss me. l love you.

1237
01:28:50,651 --> 01:28:52,642
Kiss me. Please.

1238
01:28:58,651 --> 01:29:01,040
My gosh.

1239
01:29:01,131 --> 01:29:03,884
What a dream.

1240
01:29:26,931 --> 01:29:29,081
Melinda! What...

1241
01:29:29,171 --> 01:29:32,925
- What are you doing here?
- My God.

1242
01:29:33,011 --> 01:29:35,320
l was listening at your door.

1243
01:29:35,411 --> 01:29:39,006
- For what?
- l was jealous.

1244
01:29:39,091 --> 01:29:42,322
- Jealous? Jealous of what?
- Well...

1245
01:29:42,411 --> 01:29:48,441
You went home with Stacey,
and all night long l've been upset.

1246
01:29:48,531 --> 01:29:52,365
So l guess l've realised
how much l care for you.

1247
01:29:52,451 --> 01:29:56,763
- Really?
- ls she here? l heard lovemaking talk.

1248
01:29:56,851 --> 01:29:59,684
No, that was a dream.

1249
01:29:59,771 --> 01:30:02,046
You were dreaming about her?

1250
01:30:02,131 --> 01:30:04,691
l was dreaming of you, actually.

1251
01:30:04,771 --> 01:30:09,606
- Me? Why were you dreaming about me?
- l dreamt l was making love to you.

1252
01:30:10,691 --> 01:30:13,159
- Really?
- Melinda...

1253
01:30:13,251 --> 01:30:15,481
l'm in love with you.

1254
01:30:16,771 --> 01:30:19,649
Me? You never said anything.

1255
01:30:19,731 --> 01:30:23,121
l was married,
and when it was breaking up you met Bill.

1256
01:30:23,211 --> 01:30:27,568
My God. Couldn't you tell
l've been in love with you for a long time?

1257
01:30:27,651 --> 01:30:30,609
l couldn't even tell that l was in love with you.

1258
01:30:30,691 --> 01:30:32,841
And now you're spying on me.

1259
01:30:32,931 --> 01:30:34,967
What a silly thing -

1260
01:30:35,051 --> 01:30:40,409
a grown woman, a mature, sophisticated
woman, outside a door, spying.

1261
01:30:41,251 --> 01:30:45,210
By the way,
l found a piece of your bathrobe in my door.

1262
01:30:47,051 --> 01:30:52,569
- Strange. l should tell my laundress.
- You don't have a laundress.

1263
01:30:52,651 --> 01:30:56,041
Well, marry me and we'll get a laundress.

1264
01:31:04,051 --> 01:31:09,171
So, you see, it's all in the eye of the beholder.
We hear a little story, a few hearsay details.

1265
01:31:09,251 --> 01:31:14,928
You mould them into a tragic tale - a woman's
weakness for romance is her undoing.

1266
01:31:15,011 --> 01:31:16,808
And that's how you see life.

1267
01:31:16,891 --> 01:31:21,487
Whereas you, you take those details,
you put them into an amusing romance.

1268
01:31:21,571 --> 01:31:23,368
Great. That's your take on life.

1269
01:31:23,451 --> 01:31:28,081
But, obviously, there is no one
definitive essence that can be pinned down.

1270
01:31:28,171 --> 01:31:31,720
Well, moments of humour do exist.
l exploit them.

1271
01:31:31,811 --> 01:31:35,247
But, you know, they exist
within a tragic overall framework.

1272
01:31:35,331 --> 01:31:38,846
ls everybody going
to Phil Dorfman's funeral next week?

1273
01:31:38,931 --> 01:31:43,368
He dropped dead of a heart attack. He just
had his cardiogram, which was perfect.

1274
01:31:43,451 --> 01:31:46,966
- l hate funerals.
- Me too. Always, at the wrong time, l laugh.

1275
01:31:47,051 --> 01:31:53,047
See, that's my point. We laugh because
it masks our real terror about mortality.

1276
01:31:53,131 --> 01:31:55,804
l didn't mean to bring up
the subject of funerals.

1277
01:31:55,891 --> 01:32:00,806
Well, how can it be a romantic, funny world
if you can't trust your own cardiogram?

1278
01:32:00,891 --> 01:32:03,963
- l wanna be cremated.
- Now? Or after your death?

1279
01:32:04,051 --> 01:32:07,930
Let's change the subject. We came out
to have a fun and relaxing evening.

1280
01:32:08,011 --> 01:32:11,367
Let's drink to good times. Comic or tragic,

1281
01:32:11,451 --> 01:32:14,966
the most important thing to do
is to enjoy life while you can

1282
01:32:15,051 --> 01:32:18,805
because we only go round once,
and when it's over, it's over.

1283
01:32:18,891 --> 01:32:24,170
And, perfect cardiogram or not, when
you least expect it, it could end like that.

1284
01:34:45,851 --> 01:34:49,002
