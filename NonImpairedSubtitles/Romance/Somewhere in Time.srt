149

I have some things
I've been saving
for the theater collection.

150
00:19:55,794 --> 00:19:58,661
That was a costume
from one of the plays
she was in.

151
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:02,860
Miss Roberts,
what was she like?

152
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:07,736
When I knew her,
she was kind and thoughtful,

153
00:20:07,806 --> 00:20:11,742
but she was just
too much within herself.

154
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:15,041
She, she seemed
empty somehow.

155
00:20:15,113 --> 00:20:17,547
Well, she wasn't always
that way, was she?

156

Oh, no, not at all.

157
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:21,745
People who knew her
when she was young said...

158
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:24,584
that she was quick and bright
and full of fun,

159
00:20:24,656 --> 00:20:28,217
strong, willful,
not at all the way
she was later.

160
00:20:28,293 --> 00:20:31,558
What made her change?
<i>l don't know,</i>

161
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:34,997

taken place about 19 12,

162

I have a question
for you, sir.

181
00:22:22,641 --> 00:22:25,906
Shoot.
Is time travel possible?

182
00:22:25,977 --> 00:22:29,378
That is a question.

183
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:35,216
Let me tell you something,
Richard, is it?
Yes, sir.

184
00:22:35,287 --> 00:22:40,748
I was in Venice
in 1971 .

185
00:22:40,826 --> 00:22:45,195
I was staying in
a very old hotel.

186
00:22:45,263 --> 00:22:48,061
But I mean, <i>ve</i>ry old:

187
00:22:48,133 --> 00:22:52,433
the structure,
the furnishings,
everything.

188
00:22:52,504 --> 00:22:57,066
The atmosphere was aged,
if you follow me,

189
00:22:57,142 --> 00:23:00,873
and my room, I felt
as though it was...

190
00:23:00,946 --> 00:23:05,383
a century or more
earlier than 1971 .

191
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:07,384
You understand?
Yes, sir.

192
00:23:07,452 --> 00:23:10,182
So, in other words, then,
the location is very important.

193
00:23:10,255 --> 00:23:13,554
Not all important,
but essential.
Mm-hmm.

194
00:23:13,625 --> 00:23:15,559
The rest is <i>here</i>.

195
00:23:18,797 --> 00:23:22,028
One afternoon, I--

196
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:26,400
I was lying down
in that room,

197
00:23:26,471 --> 00:23:31,568
all the sights around me...
a part of the past,

198
00:23:31,643 --> 00:23:33,577

into my brain.

It's August, 1571 .

207

I am in
the Hotel Del Vecchio.

208
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:08,004
I spelled out the details
for myself...

209
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:10,946
and did it
over and over...

210

And I'm not sure
I'd want to do it again.

215
00:24:29,167 --> 00:24:34,264
I felt exhausted afterwards,
completely washed out.

216
00:24:34,339 --> 00:24:37,035
And if it really
did happen,

217
00:24:37,108 --> 00:24:40,339
I was only there a fraction
of an instant, remember.

- Yes, sir, I understand that,
