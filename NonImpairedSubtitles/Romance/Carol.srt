170
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,564
and we just got
a new model in last week.

171
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,006
It's hand-built
with hand-painted cars.

172
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,247
It's a limited edition

173
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,606
of 5,000.

174
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,160
You might have seen it
on the way in

175
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,651
over by the elevators.

176
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,371
I would show you, but I'm sort
of confined to this desk.

177
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,122
- Do you ship?
- Special delivery.

178
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,328
You could have it
in two or three days.

179
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,050
They'd even assemble it
for you.

180
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,486
Well,

181
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,966
that's that.

182
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,043
Sold.

183
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,328
Shall I pay now?

184
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,681
Oh, yes, of course.

185
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,205
Um...

186
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,570
We'll need your account details

187
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,404
and your shipping address.

188
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,721
Of course.

189
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,241
(sighs)
I love Christmas.

190
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,165
Wrapping presents and all that.

191
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,367
And then,

192
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:17,171
somehow you wind up overcooking

193
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,243
the turkey anyway.

194
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,203
Done.

195
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,048
Where'd you learn so much
about train sets?

196
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,281
Oh, I read.

197
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,602
Too much, probably.

198
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,125
That's refreshing.

199
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,931
Thank you.

200
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,401
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

201
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,566
(whispering):
I like the hat.

202
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,245
STORE ANNOUNCER:
There's a gift for everybody

203

204
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,643
where you'll find the entire

205
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,361
including Parker's new
smooth lining 51.

206
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,921
With only one moving part,

207
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:02,243
making writing
as easy as conversation.

208
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,402
See what the sensation
of the season is

209
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,561
in our toys department

210
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,171
on the fourth floor.

211
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,446
You won't be able to resist
the best-selling...

212
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,721
(alarm ringing)

213
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,923
(ringing stops)

214
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,326
WOMAN:
You look absolutely divine!

215
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,720
Turn around.

216
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,211
- Please.
- Come on.

217
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,010
- Perfect, wonderful shoulders.
- (thumps)

218
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,326
MAN:
Move over.

219
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,766
Nobody else can see the screen.

220
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,410
Nobody else is watching.

221
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,562
(chuckles)
I'm watching.

222
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,200
MAN 2:
I've seen it six times.

223
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,443
Hmm?

224
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,489
Right now, I'm charting
the correlation

225
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,927
between what the characters say
and how they really feel.

226
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:52,163
My kid brother, the movie jerk.

227
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,641
(lively chatter)

228
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,883
I'm strictly a beer man.

229
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,804
Everything else makes me
want to vomit.

230
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,086
(chuckles)

231
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,520
Well, wine makes me
feel naughty,

232
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,891
but in a good way.

233
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,407
I drink to forget I got to
get up for work in the morning.

234
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,686
Oh, see,
that's your problem, Semco.

235
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,887
You really ought to drink

236
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,440
because you remember
you have a job.

237
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,760
Employment's a curse.

238
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,081
You have a job, Phil.

239
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,287
You call that a job?

240
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,441
I call that an illusion.

241
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,647
You get paid.

242
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,484
Is money an illusion?

243
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,449
My kid brother,
the jerk philosopher.

244
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,443
And where do you work?

245
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,364
- Mmm.
- Didn't you know?

246
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,921
Dannie works
at the New York Times.

247
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,127
No kidding.

248
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,044
It's a job.

249
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,884
What I really want
to do is write.

250
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,963
That's why I watch movies.

251
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,565
Everybody's a writer.

252
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,882
Uh, say, Therese,

253
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,644
before I get too drunk
to remember...

254
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,404
(gasps)
You did it?

255
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,561
It's fixed?

256
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,165
He said it was a cinch,
no sweat.

257
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,407
Oh, thank you, Phil.

258
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,449
I was missing it.

259
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,125
So you take pictures?

260
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,560
Well...

261
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,210
She's more excited
about some chintzy camera

262
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,283
than she is about sailing
with me to Europe.

263
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,761
- Women!
- You said it, pal.

264
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,524
- I don't believe it!
- Oh, look who's coming.

265
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,682
Does the House
Un-American Activities know

266
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,604
- you two are back on the streets?
- It's been ages.

267
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,569
- Call me, would you?
- I will, I promise.

268
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,767
You still owe me

269
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,680
- for that poker game!
- Richard, watch out!

270
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,569
- Yeah, sure, I do.
- Say,

271
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,047
you should come by the Times

272
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,440
for dinner sometime.

273
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,608
I work nights, so...

274
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,489
I got a pal
who's a junior photo editor.

275
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,727
He loves to pontificate.

276
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,564
- I'll introduce you.
- Really?

277
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,848
- Yeah, I'd like that.
- (laughter)

278
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,525
Yeah?

279
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,920
- Okay.
- Okay.

280
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,003

Are you gonna color

I know she'd love

Well, give her my best.

THERESE (voice-over):
Well, I told the customer

320
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,368
it would arrive
by Christmas Eve.

321
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,521
According to what
we've been told,

322
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,761
three days should be
plenty of time.

323
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,331
It should've been delivered
this afternoon.

324
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,244
Oh.

325
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,526
Right.

326
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,245
So it arrived,
she signed for it?

Great. Thank you.

People.

501
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:31,000
I always feel funny
taking pictures of people,

502
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:33,731
like it's some sort of...

503
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,081
in...

504
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,288
Invasion of privacy?

505
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,408
Yeah.

506
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,608
Well...

507
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:46,124
all of us, you know,
we have affinities for people.

508
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,441
We like certain people.

509
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,880
You like certain people, right?

510
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,001
Sometimes.

511
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,241
And you don't like others.

512
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,522
And you don't know why

513
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,967
you are attracted
to some people and not others.

514
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,929
The only thing
you really know is

515
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:02,926
you either are attracted
or you're not.

516
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,929
It's like physics...

517
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,441
bouncing off each other
like pinballs.

518
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,645
Yeah, but not everything's
as simple

519
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,963
as a bunch of pinballs
reacting off of each other.

520

DANNIE:
Oh... (sighs)

521

Why? Did you mind?

No.

It was one night, Harge.

HARGE:
Abby.

541

There's always Abby.

542
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,568
Abby and I were over

543
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,644
long before you and I
were over, Harge.

544
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,724
I'll have Rindy packed
and ready for you

545
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:02,008
at 4:00 on Christmas Eve.

546

Where's this place in Jersey?

551
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,326
In the country, I think.

662
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:52,371
CAROL: I ordered a gift
from her desk.

663
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,010
I forget my gloves,
she returned them,

664
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,083
and I thanked her.

665
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,403
HARGE:
Well, that's bold.

666
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,803
THERESE:
Can I do anything?

667
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,928
CAROL:
Just leave it be.

668
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,643
(smooth Christmas
carols playing)

669
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,366
Okay, snowflake.

670
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,568
Give me a big one.

671
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:31,240
You're gonna have
the most wonderful Christmas.

672
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,243
I promise.

673
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:36,370
There's room for you
in the car, Mommy.

674
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,324
You can come with us.

675
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:39,726
No, darling.

676
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,530
I wish I could.

677
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,648
You know, but sometimes,

678
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,201
mommies and daddies

679
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,528
just decide there isn't
enough room for them

680
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,603
in the same place
at the same time.

681
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:54,283
Anyway, Mommy has to stay here

682
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:57,728
and make sure Santa's elf
doesn't give away your presents

683
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,370
to another little girl.

684
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:00,885
Wouldn't want that, would you?

685
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:03,162
- No.
- No.

686
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:05,243
I love you, snowflake.

687

Mmm, you smell good.

690
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:21,807
(Carol sighs)

691
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,610
You're drunk.

692
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:24,966
(sighs)

693
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:27,043
Harge, I'm cold.

694
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,563
I-I'll make you some coffee.

695
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,046
I'm not drunk.

696
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:34,366
You can still come with us.

697
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:36,409
Go pack a bag.

698
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,369
- I can't do that.
- Yes, you can.

699
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,409
We'll get you a ticket
in the morning.

What are you gonna do?

00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,201
What are you gonna do...

703
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,010
you going to stay here
with Abby over Christmas?

704
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,366
You gonna stay
with the shopgirl in there?

705
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:49,567
- Harge!
- Huh?

706
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:50,721
What are you gonna do,
Carol, huh?

707
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,962
- What is the plan?
- (music gets louder)

708

- Damn it!

709
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:56,728
I put nothing
past women like you, Carol.

710
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,370
You married a woman like me.

711

712

with us right now...

HELMAN:
Yes, sir.

HARGE:
How's my girl?

722

Ready to go see Grandma
and Grandpa?

call a cab.

728

Just when you think
it can't get any worse,

I'll buy some for you.
I don't mind, really.

CAROL: You don't have to run
out in the middle of nowhere

permanent custody petition.

Listen, let's wait till
after Christmas...

Fred, on what grounds?

798
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:36,282
They're petitioning the judge

799
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,960
to consider a morality clause.

800
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:40,610

Abby Gerhard.

Also, they're suggesting

806
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:54,291
similar associations with...

807
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:56,920
Well, they're alleging evidence
of a pattern of behavior.

808
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:59,009
"Evidence of a pattern"?

809
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:01,925
Abby is Rindy's godmother.

810
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:04,003
Abb...

811
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:09,842
If he can't have me,

812
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,081
I can't have Rindy.

813
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:12,890
That's what...

814
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:17,808
I'm sorry,
but they seem serious.

815
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:19,769
W-When is the custody hearing?

816
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,048
It's hard to say with
the holidays and a backlog.

Your best guess, Fred.

818

819
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:28,169

Not... Let me put it this way.

822
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:36,486
It wouldn't
be advisable under...

823

- At school? In an office?
- The issue is not where,

824
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:40,085
- necessarily.
- Surely,

825
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:41,844
- a visit, supervised, but...
- Carol, these are

826
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:43,087
serious allegations.

827
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:44,844

before the hearing.

00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,810
You risk inviting
further scrutiny

829
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:49,883
- concerning your conduct.
- My conduct?

830
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:54,082
Jesus Christ.

831
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:56,766
I'm her mother, for God's sake.

832
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:03,683
Morality clause.

833
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:06,803
I see.

834
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:08,086
Do you?

835
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:10,169
No.

836
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:14,441
There's nothing moral
about keeping Rindy from me.

837
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:37,283
MAN:
Taxi!

838
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:55,601
(horn honks)

839
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:57,444
MAN 2:
Hey, watch it, lady.

840
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:17,003
♪♪

841
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:24,327
♪♪

842
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:34,451
THERESE:
Yes, that's it.

843
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:36,523
Thank you.

844
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:42,083
(register bell dings)

845
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:53,881
RICHARD:
Find what you wanted?

846
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:56,008
THERESE: Yeah, something
for someone at the store.

847
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:58,811
RICHARD:
Huh, that's nice of you.

848
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:02,009
You should stop by
on Christmas sometime.

849
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:03,969
My mom's sort of planning on it.

850
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:05,485
THERESE:
Christmas?

851
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:07,130
That's for families.

852
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:09,203
I-I'd feel, I don't know...

853
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:11,687
RICHARD:
You are family, Terry.

854
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:17,126
THERESE: I've been thinking of
putting together a portfolio.

855
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:20,051
Of my pictures, you know?

856
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:22,004
Start taking portraits, even.

857
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:23,929
Apply for jobs.

858
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:25,690
Maybe even at a newspaper.

859
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:27,046
Dannie said he knows someone.

860
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:29,123
Have you been thinking
any more about Europe?

861
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:33,123
Terry?

862
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:36,323
What?

863
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:40,730
How many times
have you been in love?

864
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:42,848
(chuckles)

865
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,241
Never.

866
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:47,289
- Until you.
- Don't lie.

867
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:49,050
You told me
about those other two girls.

868
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:51,680
Come on, they were...

869
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:55,050
I had sex with them.

870
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:56,929
That's not the same thing.

871
00:50:57,080 --> 00:51:00,004
Meaning I'm different because
we haven't gone all the way?

872
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:01,531
No.

873
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:06,042
Hey, what's this all about?

874
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:08,282
I love you.

875
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:10,522
That's what's different.

876
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:20,168
Have you ever been in love
with a boy?

877
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:24,330
No.

878
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:26,005
But you've heard of it.

879
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:27,400
Of course.

880
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:29,200
I mean, have I heard
of people like that?

881
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:31,163
- Sure.
- I don't mean people like that.

882
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:33,049
I just mean two people

883
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:35,009
who fall in love
with each other.

884
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:37,208
Say, a boy and a boy
out of the blue.

885
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:40,529
I don't know anyone like that.

886
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:42,728
But I'll tell you this,

887
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:45,360
there's always some reason
for it in the background.

888
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:49,002
So you don't think
it could just...

889
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:50,889
happen to somebody,
to anybody?

890
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:53,651
No, I don't.

891
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:54,926
What are you saying?

892
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:56,200
Are you in love with a girl?

893
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:57,611
No.

894
00:51:57,800 --> 00:51:59,040
Don't you know I want to spend

895
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:00,804
my life with you?

896
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:02,007
Come to France with me.

897
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:03,161
Let's get married.

898
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:05,004
Richard,
I'm not ready for that.

899
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:07,003
I can't just make myself...

900
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:08,924
What?

901
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:10,525
- Tell me.
- I'm sorry.

902
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:11,806
I-I have to go.

903
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:13,121
Terry!

904
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:15,601
I'm sorry.

905
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:19,725
I found Rindy's hairbrush

906
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:22,929
underneath my pillow
this morning.

907
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:25,686
Full of her hair.

908
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:27,171
She does that, you know,

909
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:29,049
to let me know
she's been a good girl

910
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:31,168
and brushed properly.

911
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,207
Usually, I clean it out,

912
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:37,761
but today, for some reason...

913
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:39,246
ABBY:
How could he?

914
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:41,164
- (sighs)
- How dare he?

915
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:43,163
A morality what?

916
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:46,529
"Clause," he said.

917
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:48,131
Oh, Carol.

918
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:50,601
If I am responsible
in any way...

919
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:52,762
Don't you dare.

920
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:55,241
Don't you ever.

921
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:09,246
Anyway, I got my eye
on this redhead

922
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:11,687
who owns a steakhouse
outside of Paramus.

923
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:13,365
- (laughs)
- I'm talking

924
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:15,443
serious Rita Hayworth redhead.

925
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:17,250
Really? You think you got
what it takes

926
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:19,323
to handle a redhead?

927
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:25,130
You going somewhere?

928
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:27,089
West, I thought.

929
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:29,208
At least for a few weeks

930
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:30,725
until the hearing.

931
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:32,689
What else am I gonna do?

932
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:35,923
Well, I know you don't like
driving alone, so...

933
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:40,803
She's young.

934
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:45,564
Tell me you know
what you're doing.

935
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:49,963
I don't.

936
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:55,809
I never did.

937
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,525
(knocking on door)

938
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:14,647
Your landlady let me in.

939
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:19,321
Merry Christmas.

940
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:23,883
Open it.

941
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:40,971
Oh, Carol.

942
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:45,407
♪♪

943
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:56,565
It's not very good.

944
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:58,051
I was rushed.

945
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:00,567
I mean, I can do better.

946
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:04,408
CAROL: It's perfect.

947
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:10,569
Was this you?

948
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:12,643
Mm-hmm.

949
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:20,370
Do you have anything

950
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:22,568
other than photo chemicals
in the icebox?

951
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:24,085
I-I'm feeling...

952
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:26,163
Sure.

953
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:36,563
(sighs)

954
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:47,601
(Carol crying softly)

955
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:02,168
Is there any point in,

956
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:04,243
I don't know, fighting it?

957
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:08,689
The injunction?

958
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:10,723
No.

959
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:12,405
I feel useless,

960
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:15,530
like I can't help you
or offer anything.

961
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:18,803
(sighs)
It has nothing to do with you.

962
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:25,963
I'm going away for a while.

963
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:29,681
When?

964
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:31,251
Where?

965
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:33,767
Wherever my car will take me.

966
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:36,207
West.

967
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:40,043
Soon.

968
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:44,527
And I thought, perhaps,

969
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:46,569
you might like to come with me.

970
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:55,287
Would you?

971
00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:58,289
Yes.

972
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:00,363
Yes, I would.

973
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,650
You don't even know her!

974
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:19,885
You can forward any of my mail
to Chicago, General Post.

975
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:21,889
I've paid rent
through February.

976
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:23,969
I had a little extra...

977
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:25,849
money saved.

978
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:27,724
RICHARD:
For our trip.

979
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:29,684
Our trip, Terry.

980
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:31,166
And now you're...

981
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:34,290
I don't believe
this is happening.

982
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:38,131
I can't explain it.
I just...

983
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:39,645
What?

984
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:42,041
You got one hell of a crush
on this woman is what.

985
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:43,247
You're like a schoolgirl.

986
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:45,164
I do not.
I just like her is all.

987
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:47,641
I'm fond of anyone
I can really talk to.

988
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:49,723
Nice.

989
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:53,369
You know what I think?

990
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:54,726
I think, two weeks from now,

991
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:57,042
you're going
to be wishing that...

992
00:57:58,440 --> 00:57:59,851
She's going to get tired of you

993
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,411
and you're going
to that wish you had never...

994
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:02,971
- You don't understand!
- Oh, I do.

995
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:04,201

Good morning.

Glad to see you didn't

TOMMY:
Pleased to meet you.

1176
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:55,008
Mr. Tucker sells notions.

1177
01:09:57,280 --> 01:09:58,327
I see.

1178
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:00,448
I don't know what
notions are, exactly,

1179
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:02,284
but they do instruct us
to use the word.

1180
01:10:02,440 --> 01:10:03,487
Says it appeals to women.

1181
01:10:03,680 --> 01:10:05,842
Do you have any lipsticks?

1182
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,764
No.
But I do have a sewing kit.

1183
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:11,285
You don't need a sewing kit.

1184
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:13,681
I can tell.

1185
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:16,571
I think we can make Chicago

01:21:19,160 --> 01:21:20,844
I haven't the strength.

1320
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:22,923
(Abby speaks indistinctly)

1321
01:21:32,360 --> 01:21:34,044
What are you thinking?

1322
01:21:34,240 --> 01:21:35,651
(sighs)

1323
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:38,167
Do you know how many times
a day I ask you that?

1324
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:40,129
I'm sorry.

1325
01:21:40,280 --> 01:21:41,884
What am I thinking?

1326
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:44,970
I'm thinking that
I'm utterly selfish and I...

1327
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:46,326
Don't do this.

1328
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:48,289
You had no idea.
How could you have known?

1329
01:21:48,440 --> 01:21:51,922
And I should've said no to you,
but I never say no.

1330
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:55,846
And it's selfish, because...

1331
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:57,365
because I just take everything,

1332
01:21:57,520 --> 01:21:59,170
and I don't know anything,

1333
01:21:59,320 --> 01:22:01,129
and I don't know what I want,
and how could I

1334
01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:03,282
when all I ever do
is say yes to everything?

1335
01:22:03,480 --> 01:22:05,369
(Crying softly)

1336
01:22:20,080 --> 01:22:23,289
I took what you gave willingly.

1337
01:22:30,520 --> 01:22:32,363
It's not your fault,

1338
01:22:32,520 --> 01:22:34,443
Therese.

1339
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:39,523
- (engine starts)
- All right?

1340
01:22:42,360 --> 01:22:44,283

1341

CAROL:
Thank you, darling.

1342
01:22:56,360 --> 01:22:57,361
ABBY (over phone):
So, how are you now?

1343
01:22:57,520 --> 01:22:59,090
CAROL:
Oh, you know.

1344
01:22:59,280 --> 01:23:01,044
Shattered, sickened.

1345
01:23:01,240 --> 01:23:03,083
ABBY: Don't worry. We'll figure
this out, I promise you.

1346
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:05,049
I hope so.

1347
01:23:05,200 --> 01:23:06,440
ABBY:
Anything else you need?

1348
01:23:06,600 --> 01:23:08,409
No, no, talk tomorrow.

1349
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:09,920
- Try and get some sleep.
- I will.

1350
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:11,490
- And don't worry.
- Thank you.

1351
01:23:11,640 --> 01:23:13,563
- Good night.
- Good night.

1352
01:23:15,680 --> 01:23:17,603
(sighs)

1353
01:23:20,840 --> 01:23:22,922
You don't have to sleep
over there.

She's gone?

1359
01:24:54,640 --> 01:24:57,086
Early this morning.

1360
01:24:57,240 --> 01:24:59,481
Is she coming back?

No.

Why do you hate me?

01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:40,769
I haven't done anything to you.

1369
01:25:40,920 --> 01:25:43,810
You really think I've flown
halfway across the country

1370
01:25:43,960 --> 01:25:45,962
to drive you back east
because I hate you

1371
01:25:46,160 --> 01:25:48,049
and want to see you suffer?

1372
01:25:49,680 --> 01:25:51,205
It's for Carol, not for me.

1373

With you and Carol,

01:26:04,760 --> 01:26:06,364
what happened?

1377
01:26:06,520 --> 01:26:08,443
It's completely different.

1378
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:12,327
I've known Carol
since I was ten years old.

1379
01:26:20,720 --> 01:26:22,529
It was five or so years ago.

1380
01:26:22,680 --> 01:26:24,444
Summer.

1381
01:26:24,600 --> 01:26:27,251
Late one night, my Ford...

1382
01:26:27,400 --> 01:26:29,926
broke down near
my mother's house.

1383
01:26:32,440 --> 01:26:35,649
We tried to stay up...

1384
01:26:35,800 --> 01:26:37,325
but curled up together

1385
01:26:37,480 --> 01:26:39,608
in my old twin bed.

1386
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:41,683
And that was it.

1387
01:26:43,480 --> 01:26:45,403
For a while.

1388
01:26:48,840 --> 01:26:51,127
And then it changed.

1389
01:26:51,280 --> 01:26:53,203
It changes.

1390
01:26:54,520 --> 01:26:56,409
Nobody's fault.

1391
01:27:06,320 --> 01:27:08,288
So...

1392
01:27:08,440 --> 01:27:09,771
What?

1393
01:27:12,720 --> 01:27:14,165
Here.

1394
01:27:16,360 --> 01:27:18,522
(door opens)

1395
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,446
CAROL (voice-over):
Dearest,

1396
01:27:30,640 --> 01:27:33,803
there are no accidents,

1397
01:27:33,960 --> 01:27:37,407
and he would've found us
one way or another.

1398
01:27:39,960 --> 01:27:42,122
Everything comes full circle.

1399
01:27:42,280 --> 01:27:44,886
Be grateful it was sooner

1400
01:27:45,040 --> 01:27:47,964
rather than later.

1401
01:27:48,120 --> 01:27:50,726
You'll think it harsh of me
to say so,

1402
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:54,726
but no explanation I offer
will satisfy you.

1403
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:00,211
Please don't be angry

1404
01:28:00,360 --> 01:28:02,408
when I tell you
that you seek resolutions

1405
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:06,406
and explanations
because you're young.

1406
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:09,962
But you will
understand this one day.

1407
01:28:25,320 --> 01:28:27,209
(coughing)

1408
01:28:36,280 --> 01:28:38,487
And when it happens,

1409
01:28:38,640 --> 01:28:42,964
I want you to imagine me there
to greet you,

1410
01:28:43,120 --> 01:28:45,248
our lives stretched out
ahead of us,

1411
01:28:45,400 --> 01:28:47,926
a perpetual sunrise.

1412
01:29:00,480 --> 01:29:02,289
But until then,

1413
01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:04,960
there must be no contact
between us.

1414
01:29:05,120 --> 01:29:07,805
I have much to do,

1415
01:29:07,960 --> 01:29:11,089
and you, my darling, even more.

1416
01:29:13,120 --> 01:29:16,124
Please believe that I would do
anything to see you happy.

1417
01:29:27,680 --> 01:29:31,241
And so,
I do the only thing I can.

1418
01:29:41,920 --> 01:29:44,207
I release you.

I had thought, perhaps,

that-that Marge and Chester

with Rindy.

1469

And why shouldn't
she get along well?

1476
01:34:24,040 --> 01:34:25,963
He's a very expensive doctor.

1477
01:34:26,120 --> 01:34:29,283
Well, actually,
he's not a doctor.

1478
01:34:29,440 --> 01:34:31,363
He's a psychotherapist.

1479
01:34:33,120 --> 01:34:35,726
Well, he's very well regarded.

1480
01:34:35,880 --> 01:34:38,406
A Yale man, like your uncle.

1481
01:34:38,560 --> 01:34:40,403
Yes, but that doesn't
make him a doctor.

For our own country,
it has been a time...

1485

with her recovery
from the events of the winter,

Saddlebrook Institute
psychiatrists

1548

clearly stating

a series of events precipitated
by my client's husband

- That's absurd!

01:40:06,520 --> 01:40:08,170

I want to see these
depositions, and secondly, I...

01:40:16,920 --> 01:40:18,081
Contained in those tapes...

FRED:
This is off the record, honey.

1562

CAROL:
May as well be on the record.

1563
01:40:23,640 --> 01:40:25,290
Harge...

1564
01:40:25,440 --> 01:40:26,771
I want you...

1565
01:40:26,920 --> 01:40:28,843
to be happy.

1566
01:40:29,040 --> 01:40:30,610
I didn't give you that.

1567
01:40:30,760 --> 01:40:32,569
I... I failed you.

1568
01:40:32,720 --> 01:40:36,520
I mean, we both
could have given more, but...

1569
01:40:36,680 --> 01:40:39,206
we gave each other Rindy,

1570
01:40:39,360 --> 01:40:43,160
and that is
the most breathtaking,

1571
01:40:43,320 --> 01:40:45,527
the most generous of gifts.

1572
01:40:45,720 --> 01:40:49,202
So why are we spending
so much time

1573
01:40:49,360 --> 01:40:51,886
trying to keep her
from each other?

1574
01:40:53,760 --> 01:40:55,808
Now, what happened
with Therese...

1575
01:40:55,960 --> 01:40:57,325
I wanted.

1576
01:40:57,480 --> 01:41:00,563
And I will not deny it,

1577
01:41:00,720 --> 01:41:03,007
or say that I...

1578
01:41:03,200 --> 01:41:04,770
But I do regret,

1579
01:41:04,920 --> 01:41:07,890
and I grieve for the mess
we are about to make

1580
01:41:08,080 --> 01:41:10,082
of our child's life.

1581
01:41:10,240 --> 01:41:13,289
We, Harge,
are both responsible.

1582
01:41:15,440 --> 01:41:18,683
So I think I...
we-we should set it right.

1583
01:41:23,120 --> 01:41:24,929
Now, I think that Harge

1584
01:41:25,080 --> 01:41:26,730
should have custody

1585
01:41:26,880 --> 01:41:28,803
- of Rindy...
- FRED: Could I suggest we just take a break

1586
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:30,325
- for a moment?
- CAROL: No! (several talking)

1587
01:41:30,520 --> 01:41:31,851
Fred, will you let me speak?

1588
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:33,490
Because if you don't,

1589
01:41:33,640 --> 01:41:35,881
I will not be able to c-cope.

1590
01:41:37,240 --> 01:41:38,401
Now, I'm no martyr.

1591
01:41:38,560 --> 01:41:40,608
I have no clue
what is best for me.

1592
01:41:40,760 --> 01:41:43,081
But I do know,
and I feel it in my bones,

1593
01:41:43,280 --> 01:41:44,691
what is best for my daughter.

1594
01:41:44,840 --> 01:41:46,046
(trembling breath)

(sniffles softly)

1596
01:41:47,440 --> 01:41:49,169
Now, I want visits
with her, Harge.

1597
01:41:49,320 --> 01:41:50,810
I don't care
if they're supervised.

1598
01:41:50,960 --> 01:41:53,008
I just want them to be regular.

1599
01:41:55,360 --> 01:41:57,442
Now, there was a time...

1600
01:41:57,600 --> 01:41:59,409
when I would have done
almost anything,

1601
01:41:59,560 --> 01:42:01,767
I would have
locked myself away...

1602
01:42:01,920 --> 01:42:04,400
(sniffles, pants)
to keep Rindy with me.

1603

(sniffles)

1604
01:42:06,560 --> 01:42:08,210
But what use am I to her...

1605
01:42:08,360 --> 01:42:11,728
to us, if I'm living
against my own grain?

1606

So that's the deal.

I won't... I cannot
negotiate anymore.

You take it or leave it.

we go to court.

No. How could I hate you?

Nothing.

1658
01:45:54,480 --> 01:45:58,201
Harge and I are selling
the house.

1659
01:45:58,360 --> 01:46:01,921
- I've taken an apartment on Madison Avenue.
- No, thank you.

1660
01:46:02,120 --> 01:46:04,487
And a job, believe it or not.

1661

I'm gonna work
at a furniture house

1662

1671

It's big enough for two.

1672
01:46:41,200 --> 01:46:44,443
I was hoping you might like
to come live with me,

No, I don't think so.
