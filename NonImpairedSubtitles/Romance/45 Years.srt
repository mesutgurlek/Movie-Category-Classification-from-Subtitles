1
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:50,526
Come on, Max.

2
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,954
- Morning, Mrs Mercer.
- Oh, Chris.

3
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:19,539
You're early this morning.

4
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,916
I've got the twins waking me up
at the crack of dawn.

5
00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:23,668
Oh, my God, I completely forgot.

6
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:25,712
- Congratulations.
- Cheers.

7
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:28,173
- How are you both coping?
- It's a hell of a lot of work.

8
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:29,549
I don't doubt it a second.

9
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:32,093
But you'll be fine.
You were always a capable young man.

10
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:33,470
You must be getting excited.

11
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:36,181
- Saturday, isn't it?
- Don't remind me. So much work to do.

12
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:37,474
Yeah, it'll be fine.

13
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:39,309
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

14
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:41,519
And I'm really over the moon
for both of you.

15
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:44,272
- Thank you, Mrs Mercer.
- Kate. Call me Kate.

16
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:47,666
- We're not at school any more.
- Will do.

17
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:23,702
What do you think of that Platters song?

18
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:25,996
- The what?
- The Platters song.

19
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:28,441
What for?

20
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,276
First dance.

21
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:33,279
Or think it's a bit naff to have
the same song we had at our wedding?

22
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:34,906
No. Lovely song.

23
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:37,799
- I've always liked it.
- Yeah, I know.

24
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:50,505
Asked me how I knew

25
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:53,148
My true love was true

26
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:12,277
- What is it?
- A letter.

27
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:15,405
Yes, I know, but who from?

28
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:18,074
- It's in German.
- Yeah.

29
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:20,259
What's it say?

30
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:26,348
Well, I can't remember the verbs
as well as the nouns, but...

31
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:30,170
but I think it says they've found her.

32
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,172
Found who?

33
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,674
Well, her body, anyway.

34
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,858
God, who? Geoff.

35
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:40,988
They've found Katya.

36
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,475
Oh.

37
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:46,769
You know who I'm talking about,
don't you?

38
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:48,021
Of course.

39
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:51,191
Cos, I remember telling you,
clear as day.

40
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,818
Of course I remember.
I mean, it was a long time ago.

41
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:56,128
Yeah, I know I told you about my Katya.

42
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:05,220
She's been there over 50 years,
like something in the freezer.

43
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:08,682
Now they've found her.

44
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:15,480
Like that, er, Tollund Man
in the Swedish bog.

45
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:18,051
Well, Danish, actually.

46
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,011
- Hm?
- It was on the curriculum for years.

47
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:22,237
I taught it to the third-formers.

48
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:29,661
I'll make some more tea.

49
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:45,552
Yeah, I'm going to need a dictionary.

50
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:50,166
I don't know where to look.

51
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:52,517
Why don't you check
in the plastic boxes?

52
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:10,577
Nothing.
Nothing but "do-it-yourself" books.

53
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:19,503
Ah!

54
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:21,406
That's it.

55
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:23,366
Yeah.

56
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:25,550
Ah, thank you.

57
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:32,875
You see, what's happened is
the snow has completely melted.

58
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:35,295
All that's left is the ice.

59
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,797
And that's how they found her.

60
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:41,384
- What do you mean?
- Well, she's still there.

61
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:43,469
- In the ice?
- Yeah.

62
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:47,598
Way down, I'm sure, but the water
is very pure up there.

63
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:50,560
It must be, so they can see her.

64
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,563
- Well, haven't they taken her out?
- Not yet.

65
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:54,814
Why not?

66
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:57,525
Well, she's in a glacier
in the Swiss mountains, Kate.

67
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,235
It can't be that easy.

68
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:01,420
There are no roads up there.

69
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:03,948
Hm.

70
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:05,783
So, how do they know it's her?

71
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:08,411
I mean, it might not be her at all.

72
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:11,748
Well, they've made an assumption, I
suppose, from where they found her.

73
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:14,167
Maybe they can tell
from what she's wearing.

74
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:15,877
From what she's wearing?

75
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:21,799
Oh, yeah, yeah, those, er,
airmen in... Iceland, I think it was,

76
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:23,760
they were perfectly preserved.

77
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,345
Oh, I don't remember that.

78
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:28,181
Yes. I saw a documentary on it.

79
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:32,617
They were the same as when they died
because of how quickly they froze.

80
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:34,937
And you think that's what's happened?

81
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:37,747
Well, I don't know, but you can imagine.

82
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:43,863
Not sure it works like that.
Not after all this time.

83
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:46,491
How strange would that be, though?

84
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:49,634
She'll look like she did in 1962.

85
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:52,387
And I look like this.

86
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:04,717
What is it?

87
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:06,902
Er, don't be cross, Kate.

88
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:09,446
I'm going to have a smoke.

89
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,984
- Are you all right?
- Fine.

90
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:53,532
Please eat this. And take your pills.

91
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:57,786
They've asked
if I want to go to Switzerland.

92
00:08:58,454 --> 00:08:59,981
Why would they ask that?

93
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:02,165
Well, to see the body.

94
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,793
- When?
- Soon, I suppose.

95
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:08,412
- You aren't thinking of going?
- Don't know.

96
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:12,043
- All the way to Switzerland?
- It's not that far.

97
00:09:12,143 --> 00:09:15,496
- There are flights from Stansted.
- Yeah, but it's far enough.

98
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:17,457
- You don't think I should?
- Honestly?

99
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,459
Well, no.

100
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,502
I don't see the point.

101
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:24,755
- Plus we've got the party on Saturday.
- I wasn't thinking of going now.

102
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:27,175
- I wouldn't go now.
- Yeah, but still.

103
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:30,303
I don't like the idea of you climbing
a big bloody mountain.

104
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,638
Well, I don't think
it would come to that.

105
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:34,974
You don't like going for a walk with me
on the Broads

106
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:37,101
- and that's as flat as a pancake.
- I know.

107
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:40,730
Like I said, Kate,
it wouldn't come to that.

108
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,914
But still...

109
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:47,487
- Don't you have to go into town?
- Oh, I can rearrange.

110
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,697
No, you should go.

111
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:51,616
It's been a bit of a shock, that's all.

112
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:53,800
But I'm fine.

113
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:58,013
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, positive.

114
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:38,746
Oh. It looks different, all empty.

115
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:41,290
Well, this is where the tables
are usually placed.

116
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:45,086
The top one over there,
so that everyone can see you.

117
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:47,588
We won't be having a top table,
but thank you.

118
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:48,798
Really?

119
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:51,384
A top table is so lovely
at an event like this.

120
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,761
The two of you as a focal point
of the room.

121
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:55,846
We're not trying to recreate
the wedding.

122
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:57,640
It's just a party.

123
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,949
Yes, well, it's your choice, of course.

124
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:06,148
I will say, though, it's a wonderful
place, location-wise, for an anniversary.

125
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:08,109
It's your 40th, isn't it?

126
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:09,402
45th.

127
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,586
That's an unusual one to celebrate.

128
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:17,676
My husband was ill and our 40th
was cancelled, so we had to rearrange.

129
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:22,472
Well, I must try and make this one
super-special, then, mustn't I?

130
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:28,895
And this really is a great venue
for such an event.

131
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,564
So full of history, you see?

132
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:33,801
Like a good marriage.

133
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:38,014
Did you know that the Trafalgar Ball
was held here?

134
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:39,390
Yes, your assistant told me.

135
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:41,392
It was in 1805.

136
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:43,811
Can you imagine
how incredible that must have been?

137
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:48,915
Everyone here, dressed in their finest,
celebrating such an achievement.

138
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:51,501
Wasn't Nelson killed?

139
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:53,837
But the battle was won.

140
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:57,841
And that has to be worth celebrating,
doesn't it?

141
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:05,791
We had a table at our wedding,
a top table, but we didn't like it at all.

142
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:09,060
My husband thought it
a horribly bourgeois tradition.

143
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:13,674
Shall we have a look at the canapé list?

144
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:15,551
Er, yes, indeed.

145
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:17,736
I'll be right back.

146
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:20,029
No rush.

147
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:38,274
You have reached Geoff and Kate.
Please leave a message.

148
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:04,133
You haven't listened to this
for a long time.

149
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:08,539
- How are you feeling?
- I'm fine.

150
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,124
What have you done to your finger?

151
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:15,212
Oh, yeah, I was, er... trying to mend the
lavatory and, er, well, I cut me thumb.

152
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:16,422
Ugh.

153
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:18,174
Did you manage to fix it?

154
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:20,441
It needs a new ballcock, I think.

155
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:24,722
- Tried calling earlier on.
- Did you leave a message?

156
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:26,932
No, I just wanted to check
you were all right.

157
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:29,033
Right.

158
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:36,082
- What are you reading?
- Kierkegaard.

159
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,793
Gracious,
are you having a go at that again?

160
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:43,199
You know, you have three editions
of that book,

161
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:47,176
and I don't think you've got past
chapter two in any of them.

162
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:01,592
Yeah, it's been an odd day.

163
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:03,427
It sure has.

164
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:08,140
I just, er... stayed at home,

165
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,559
you know, grappling with the ballcock.

166
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:12,561
But you're right.

167
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:13,979
I hardly go walking any more.

168
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,650
And it was a nice day, so off I went.

169
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,209
- So, where did you go?
- Just to the village.

170
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,737
To buy cigarettes?

171
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:27,326
I haven't lost my sense of smell,
you know?

172
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:30,329
I just don't want us
to start smoking again.

173
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:31,872
No, I won't, I won't.

174
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:33,165
I promise.

175
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:35,251
OK. Go on.

176
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:40,422
So, I was in the village,
and I don't know what happened

177
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:43,759
but that racist
from the community centre...

178
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:45,469
Mm. Sandra Wilkins.

179
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:47,654
Yeah, her.

180
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:51,809
She came up to me, right up to me face,

181
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:55,078
and she kept asking me
if I was all right.

182
00:15:56,372 --> 00:16:00,333
And when I said I was,
she wouldn't believe me.

183
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:04,212
And... I wasn't doing anything.

184
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:10,160
Nothing. Just sitting on the bench
by the duck pond,

185
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,595
minding me own business
and getting some air.

186
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:15,040
All done.

187
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:19,251
- All I was doing, I promise.
- I believe you.

188
00:16:19,936 --> 00:16:21,589
She's a dreadful woman.

189
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:23,773
- Just ignore her.
- Mm.

190
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:33,767
Is it all right?

191
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:35,185
Oh, it's great. Great.

192
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:37,370
Yeah. Mm.

193
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:40,774
A drop more?

194
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:42,959
Mm, thank you.

195
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:08,609
- What?
- Nothing.

196
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:18,077
- There's something I want to tell you.
- OK.

197
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:21,690
You know, I feel sure
I've told you before,

198
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:25,668
but it was a long time ago,
so, I mean, I could be wrong.

199
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:32,993
- OK, go on.
- Yeah.

200
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:35,595
Um, I was her next of kin.

201
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:40,084
What do you mean?

202
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:42,127
Well, officially.

203
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:45,464
I was her next of kin.
I'm sure I told you this before, Kate.

204
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:49,609
I think I would remember my husband
being another woman's next of kin.

205
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:55,015
- Why?
- Why what?

206
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:57,142
Well, why were you her next of kin?

207
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:59,520
Because they thought we were married.

208
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:02,773
- Who did?
- The authorities. People.

209
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:04,149
What made them think that?

210
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:06,334
We told them we were.

211
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:09,405
You weren't, though?

212
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:11,991
Oh, no, no, no. No, hell, no.

213
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:15,202
We just had to pretend, so people
would let us stay in their houses.

214
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:20,514
Different in those days, Kate,
and then after the accident...

215
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,753
You're not lying to me?

216
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:28,382
No. Kate, she wore a ring on her finger.

217
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:33,236
It was a small wooden ring,
like a curtain ring, made of oak.

218
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,473
Funny you'd remember that.

219
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:38,658
Well, it wasn't real.

220
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:51,671
OK, you could've...
you could've just told me, Geoff.

221
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,883
I thought I had.

222
00:18:56,218 --> 00:19:01,430
If I hadn't, well, it's hardly, er...

223
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:04,668
the sort of thing you tell

224
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:08,229
your beautiful new girlfriend, is it?

225
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:13,943
I suppose not.

226
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:21,769
I think I'm going to have a...
go upstairs and have a bath.

227
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:24,646
I've got lots to do tomorrow.

228
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:27,316
- Are you sure you're all right?
- Yes. Yes.

229
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,567
Yeah, really, I am.

230
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:32,071
I can hardly be cross with something
that happened before we existed, can I?

231
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,255
Not really.

232
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,176
Still...

233
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:25,139
I suppose a cuddle's
out of the question.

234
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:41,739
It doesn't even feel like it was me
that was there.

235
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:44,560
Do you know what I mean?

236
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,270
How long had you been up there?

237
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:49,064
Oh, six or seven weeks, I suppose.

238
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:51,249
It seemed a lot longer.

239
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:54,695
We had a map, er, to start with.

240
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:57,505
It was so bloody unreliable.

241
00:20:58,298 --> 00:21:00,383
I've still got it somewhere.

242
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:04,705
Yeah, we were getting higher
into the mountains

243
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:09,626
and I decided it would be best
if we found someone,

244
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:13,437
you know, to help us
get to the Italian border.

245
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:16,508
- A guide?
- Yeah, wasn't really a guide.

246
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:20,319
This swarthy little bastard
who thought he was Jack Kerouac.

247
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:24,073
- You always did hate Kerouac.
- Yes, I did.

248
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,060
Maybe you were jealous.

249
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,370
- What, of Jack Kerouac?
- Of the guide.

250
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:32,858
Was he flirting with her?

251
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:36,862
Well, they did have, er... the language.

252
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:40,923
My German, it wasn't that great,
what with its accent.

253
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:43,827
They laughed a lot.

254
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:46,580
He was forever making these jokes
I didn't get.

255
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:50,182
- Oh, God, you wouldn't like that.
- No, I didn't.

256
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:57,174
They were walking up ahead,
more than they needed to perhaps,

257
00:21:57,274 --> 00:22:01,444
or... maybe I just let them,
I don't know.

258
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:06,574
We were on a track round this rock,

259
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:11,871
and the glacier was on the right,
below us.

260
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:14,566
Way down.

261
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,860
Beautiful thing, it was.

262
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,196
You'd love the landscape
out there, Kate.

263
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:21,380
- You really would.
- Yeah, I'm sure.

264
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:27,803
They were out of sight,
round the corner,

265
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:34,310
and the last sound but one
that I heard was her laughter.

266
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:38,314
And, Christ, did it annoy me.

267
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:42,568
But then, there was a scream.

268
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,905
It wasn't a loud scream, neither.

269
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:52,203
Sort of outpouring of air from her lungs,
from the shock, I suppose.

270
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:55,456
It was low and guttural,

271
00:22:56,458 --> 00:23:01,745
not like her voice,
which was soft, higher-pitched.

272
00:23:03,807 --> 00:23:06,034
God, that's just horrible.

273
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:08,495
Mm. Mm.

274
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:10,163
And then what?

275
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:12,124
That was it, really.

276
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:14,266
When I got there, she'd gone.

277
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:18,145
And Kerouac was looking down this hole.

278
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:22,384
A fissure.

279
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:26,946
Yeah, a fissure, I suppose you'd call it,
like a narrow, narrow crack in the rock.

280
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:30,324
Do you remember that one in Scotland?

281
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:34,771
- Yeah, I do.
- Yeah. Well, it was like that one.

282
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:37,706
- Yeah.
- Only much deeper.

283
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:41,252
And Kerouac was just standing there.

284
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:47,550
His face, oddly enough,
it looked almost yellow.

285
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,958
Was she blonde?

286
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:57,101
- Sorry?
- Did she have blonde hair?

287
00:23:57,686 --> 00:23:59,880
Oh, no, no. She had dark hair.

288
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,214
- Like mine, then.
- Mm.

289
00:24:01,314 --> 00:24:03,399
I mean, not now.

290
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:06,026
Yeah, like yours.

291
00:24:07,195 --> 00:24:09,222
How old was she?

292
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:15,896
She was two years older than me,
and that was '62.

293
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:17,981
Yeah, so she was about 27.

294
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:20,166
Yeah.

295
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:23,945
My mum died that year.

296
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:25,906
- Did she?
- Yeah. Mm.

297
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:29,034
- I don't know why that's funny but it is.
- Funny?

298
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:33,246
Well, we didn't know each other then,
you and I,

299
00:24:33,346 --> 00:24:37,501
but we were both going through something
really unpleasant, and...

300
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:41,838
and yet we never talked about it in all
the years that we've known each other.

301
00:24:41,938 --> 00:24:45,399
- Never.
- No. Never have.

302
00:25:02,542 --> 00:25:04,627
I'm tired.

303
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:08,005
Shall I turn off the light?

304
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:11,008
Yeah.

305
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:25,940
I'm quite tired, too.

306
00:25:49,464 --> 00:25:51,173
Come on.

307
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:54,176
Max!

308
00:26:01,434 --> 00:26:02,544
Max!

309
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:05,088
Yeah, boy! Come on!

310
00:26:05,188 --> 00:26:07,273
Come on! Good boy.

311
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:36,870
You're up early this morning.

312
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:39,873
Yeah, I thought I might come into town
with you, if you don't mind.

313
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:41,124
No, of course I don't mind.

314
00:26:41,224 --> 00:26:44,544
Yeah, I want to go to Thorns,
get a new ballcock.

315
00:26:44,644 --> 00:26:46,729
Oh, good.

316
00:26:50,817 --> 00:26:53,944
Do you think my library card
will still be valid, Kate?

317
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:58,058
- I don't see why not.
- I might pop in there if there's time.

318
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:00,242
Have a bit of a browse.

319
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:03,355
- We could have some lunch.
- Yeah, great.

320
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:06,566
Well, er, I'll just go do
what I have to do.

321
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:08,485
Give us a shout when you're ready.

322
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:09,694
OK.

323
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:13,213
About an hour. I've got to call
the florist and one or two things.

324
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:37,973
Do you think the library will have
anything on climate change?

325
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:40,658
- On what?
- Climate change.

326
00:27:58,093 --> 00:28:00,177
- Sorry I'm late.
- All right.

327
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:03,206
- Did you get the thing?
- What thing?

328
00:28:03,306 --> 00:28:05,667
- The ballcock.
- Er, they have to order it.

329
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:07,851
I'll pick it up in a few days.

330
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:11,423
What do you want to eat?

331
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:14,175
We've got to think a lot more
about the environment.

332
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:16,636
- Well, we recycle.
- Do we?

333
00:28:16,736 --> 00:28:19,598
- Yeah. Well, I try to, anyway.
- Well, we should.

334
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:23,518
You're welcome to clean out the dog cans
and put them in the right bins.

335
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:27,689
Because these glaciers, they're melting
a lot more than people imagined,

336
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:31,067
- and the water's just not coming down.
- It's got to go somewhere.

337
00:28:31,167 --> 00:28:35,739
No, it's saturating into the rock beneath,
and it's building up and up and up.

338
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:36,948
- Like...
- Like a dam.

339
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:41,686
Like a dam, yeah. It's waiting,
waiting, waiting, and then...

340
00:28:43,288 --> 00:28:45,081
Careful. No warning.

341
00:28:45,181 --> 00:28:49,127
Come down like a tsunami,
wipe out everything in its path.

342
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:54,633
Schools, churches, people in cafes
drinking their coffee,

343
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:57,693
old men in shops
tinkering with their cuckoo clocks.

344
00:28:59,612 --> 00:29:02,432
And if they hadn't found her,
that's when she'd have come down,

345
00:29:02,532 --> 00:29:04,893
with all the rock and debris.

346
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:07,077
We'll be long dead by then.

347
00:29:12,208 --> 00:29:14,209
Oh.

348
00:29:15,378 --> 00:29:16,571
Put your book away.

349
00:29:16,671 --> 00:29:18,756
Oh, yeah.

350
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:25,622
- You screening my calls, Kate?
- Not really.

351
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:26,831
- Hello.
- Hi.

352
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:28,541
- Sally!
- Hi, Geoff.

353
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:30,585
That's my favourite one, there.

354
00:29:30,685 --> 00:29:34,089
OK, Mum. I think it's enough now.
It's getting really boring.

355
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:37,384
- I'm proud of my grandson.
- Sally, I want to have a look at Charley.

356
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:39,960
These are so lovely.

357
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:42,180
And the photos are really beautiful.

358
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,557
- Aren't they?
- Sally's going to be a photographer.

359
00:29:44,657 --> 00:29:47,435
I'm not. I'm just taking an evening
course, just for the fun of it.

360
00:29:47,535 --> 00:29:48,603
It's nothing grand.

361
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:51,189
- But it might lead to something.
- Or it might not.

362
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:54,567
We shall see, won't we?
But you should concentrate on it.

363
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:57,779
I took it up about three months ago.

364
00:29:57,879 --> 00:30:01,449
It's a good instrument to learn.
You can play anything on the ukulele.

365
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:06,579
It's not just George Formby, which is good
because, as you know, I always hated him.

366
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:08,873
The Internet is absolutely brilliant.

367
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:12,085
If you go to a guy
called justinguitars.com,

368
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:14,546
he actually teaches guitar,
but it's all free.

369
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:17,048
He's started, er,
teaching ukulele as well.

370
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:18,591
See you later. Have a nice time.

371
00:30:18,691 --> 00:30:20,301
All right, see you later.

372
00:30:20,401 --> 00:30:23,054
I don't think... I don't think
Geoff wanted to go to the pub.

373
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:25,140
It's either that
or he comes shopping with us.

374
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,891
We could have gone to the pub,
all of us.

375
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:28,852
Know what he's like
with daytime drinking.

376
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:30,603
Oh, he'll be all right.

377
00:30:30,703 --> 00:30:32,939
Anyway, it gives him a chance to vent.

378
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:34,774
- About what?
- About you.

379
00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:36,192
Mum!

380
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:39,112
Not about you as such,
but about the party.

381
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:41,406
What do you mean about...
vent about the party?

382
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:44,200
When I think how awful George was
before our 40th,

383
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,077
I was that close to divorcing him.

384
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:47,495
Ignore her.

385
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:50,472
So, what's going to happen
with your dress? What would you like?

386
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:58,730
So, should I not be having a party?

387
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:00,508
Of course you should.

388
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:02,385
It is a lot of pressure for both of us.

389
00:31:02,485 --> 00:31:04,763
And I hate parties anyway,
at the best of times.

390
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:07,056
I mean, I never even
celebrate my birthday.

391
00:31:07,156 --> 00:31:09,517
No, no, no, no, no, you have to.

392
00:31:09,617 --> 00:31:11,478
I mean, that's the strange thing.

393
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:15,064
George was awful, but then do you
remember him at the actual party?

394
00:31:15,164 --> 00:31:16,649
How much he cried?

395
00:31:16,749 --> 00:31:18,834
And not only during the speeches.

396
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:22,713
Yeah, he was very sweet.

397
00:31:23,631 --> 00:31:25,366
That's why these things are important.

398
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:27,750
What, to make our husbands cry?

399
00:31:28,035 --> 00:31:31,039
Not just husbands, all men.

400
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:32,665
It's always them that break first.

401
00:31:32,765 --> 00:31:35,752
Sally's wedding, Charley's christening.

402
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:39,354
We hold it together cos we already
know how important these things are.

403
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:44,677
Geoff is not much of a crier.

404
00:31:44,777 --> 00:31:46,862
I bet he cried at your wedding.

405
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:49,823
I don't remember.

406
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:56,981
If it's some twist of evolution

407
00:31:57,081 --> 00:32:01,528
that needs men to be obsessed
by their obituaries, their legacies,

408
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:05,698
then maybe it's ours to nudge them
into realising what's really important

409
00:32:05,798 --> 00:32:09,551
before they kill themselves,
you know, with the disappointment.

410
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:25,877
- Morning.
- Oh.

411
00:32:26,483 --> 00:32:28,370
I nodded off.

412
00:32:30,698 --> 00:32:32,600
What did you think of Sally's photos?

413
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:35,562
- Mm?
- Sally's photos.

414
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:37,313
I think she's got a very good eye.

415
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:39,399
Oh, sure. Yeah. Mm.

416
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:41,150
Mm.

417
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:45,572
I sometimes think it's a shame not to
have more photos around the house.

418
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:47,949
We could put some up.

419
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:51,119
Yeah, but we don't have any. Not really.

420
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:55,377
I mean, not like Lena does
with her wall display.

421
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:06,149
I suppose it's because they've got
children and grandchildren, and...

422
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:12,823
I guess we didn't see the point of
taking pictures of ourselves.

423
00:33:13,866 --> 00:33:15,476
Would have been a bit vain.

424
00:33:15,576 --> 00:33:19,439
You used to say that everybody
taking pictures all the time

425
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:21,941
stopped anyone having any fun.

426
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:23,902
- Did I?
- You did.

427
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:26,336
- Sounds like something I'd say.
- Mm-hm.

428
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:30,617
You had a camera, once.

429
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:32,702
- Yeah, a Yashica.
- Mm, a Yashica.

430
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:34,162
Yeah, I've still got it.

431
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:36,346
It's in the loft.

432
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:44,104
Now that we're older, though,
it... it's a shame.

433
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:48,316
What would you want photos of?

434
00:33:51,612 --> 00:33:54,307
- Max when he was a pup.
- Mm-hm.

435
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:56,116
Tessa before him.

436
00:33:57,952 --> 00:34:03,040
You when you were decorating Clitheroe
and you hammered that nail into your hand.

437
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:04,525
You want a photograph of that?

438
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:05,944
Oh, you know what I mean.

439
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:08,029
It was our first house.

440
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:10,213
It was.

441
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:14,285
Yeah, it was my first home
since leaving home,

442
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:16,970
since leaving my parents,
leaving my father.

443
00:34:21,976 --> 00:34:25,380
I suppose we don't realise at the time

444
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:28,065
but those memories...

445
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:32,444
...they're the things, aren't they?

446
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:39,618
I'd want a picture of you
at the Leeds Mecca.

447
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:42,370
That's where we met.

448
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:44,831
You were a bloody knockout.

449
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:48,861
Oh, it's odd, isn't it,
thinking of us back then?

450
00:34:48,961 --> 00:34:54,826
I wasn't even 20, and you were so cool,
with your cigarette hanging in your mouth.

451
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:56,468
Mm.

452
00:34:59,013 --> 00:35:01,098
Tell you what.

453
00:35:01,724 --> 00:35:03,292
- What are you doing?
- Come on.

454
00:35:03,392 --> 00:35:05,044
- We can move the...
- Oh, bugger off!

455
00:35:05,144 --> 00:35:06,254
Come on.

456
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:10,598
I'm not prancing around
in the living room at this time of night.

457
00:35:39,314 --> 00:35:41,054
Over the top, yeah.

458
00:36:05,913 --> 00:36:07,998
We ain't 20 any more.

459
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:10,109
No.

460
00:36:10,209 --> 00:36:12,294
Let's go upstairs.

461
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:36,359
Come on with ya.

462
00:36:45,894 --> 00:36:48,121
Hope I can remember what you do.

463
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:52,918
I'll show you.

464
00:36:58,799 --> 00:37:01,244
- How are you doing down there?
- I think I'm ready.

465
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:02,453
Yeah?

466
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:05,331
- You don't want me to go on top?
- No, I'm nearly there.

467
00:37:05,431 --> 00:37:07,208
Oh, you are, too.

468
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:09,351
Oh, there you go.

469
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:12,547
Oh, yeah.

470
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:14,522
Oh.

471
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:20,070
A kiss.

472
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,164
Open your eyes.

473
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:36,294
- Uh...
- Oh, shit.

474
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:40,632
Oh, bugger.

475
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,385
- I think I've lost it.
- I...

476
00:37:45,888 --> 00:37:47,973
OK, OK, OK.

477
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:55,725
Geoff, it's OK, it's OK.

478
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:02,404
Hey.

479
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:06,559
- Aw...
- It's OK.

480
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:09,327
No, let's just go to sleep.

481
00:39:25,821 --> 00:39:27,556
Geoff?

482
00:39:27,656 --> 00:39:29,699
What are you doing?

483
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:32,952
- Geoff?
- I'm OK, Kate.

484
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:35,690
Please come down. This is ridiculous.

485
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:37,874
I'm OK.

486
00:39:39,835 --> 00:39:41,570
What's that in your hand?

487
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:43,322
Nothing.

488
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:46,492
- Is it her?
- I found it.

489
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:49,704
You didn't find it. You went looking
for it in the middle of the night

490
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:52,540
and that's not the same thing at all.

491
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,250
- Let me see it.
- No.

492
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:56,711
Please, Geoff. Can I see it?

493
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:59,046
Please, Kate, just go back to bed.

494
00:39:59,146 --> 00:40:01,231
Show me the bloody picture!

495
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:06,178
It's just a picture. It's all it is.

496
00:40:06,278 --> 00:40:08,988
It doesn't mean anything.
It's just a fucking picture.

497
00:40:24,296 --> 00:40:26,381
Thanks.

498
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:50,113
Max!

499
00:40:54,034 --> 00:40:56,119
Come on!

500
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:29,053
Are you getting someone
to do your makeup on Saturday?

501
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:31,237
I wasn't thinking of it.

502
00:41:31,363 --> 00:41:34,433
I know this girl. She's very subtle.

503
00:41:34,533 --> 00:41:37,593
You wouldn't have to worry about
looking like a hooker.

504
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:44,860
Sally's got this amazing roll-on thing,
zaps away dark circles.

505
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,446
I'm sure you could borrow it.

506
00:41:47,546 --> 00:41:50,908
If I'm looking tired,
you can just tell me.

507
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:53,134
You're looking tired.

508
00:41:56,472 --> 00:41:58,556
I'm fine.

509
00:41:59,391 --> 00:42:01,676
Ugh, this weather.

510
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:07,007
I'm just telling you what George said.

511
00:42:07,107 --> 00:42:09,927
I'm not trying to upset you.
Really, I'm not.

512
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:12,346
I'm not upset,
but you're not telling me anything.

513
00:42:12,446 --> 00:42:15,182
You're just saying that Geoff
was in a strange mood.

514
00:42:15,282 --> 00:42:17,367
That's what George said.

515
00:42:17,743 --> 00:42:19,827
Did Geoff say anything?

516
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:21,689
Like what?

517
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:23,482
That's what I'm asking you.

518
00:42:23,582 --> 00:42:27,301
- About the party?
- No, not about the party.

519
00:42:27,686 --> 00:42:30,262
They were talking politics.

520
00:42:30,681 --> 00:42:33,409
- That's it?
- Well, he was very aggressive.

521
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:36,120
Well, I'm sure George
can stand up for himself.

522
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:38,247
He was acting like he used to.

523
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:40,431
Meaning?

524
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:43,252
Like that time he kept accusing me
of being a fascist

525
00:42:43,352 --> 00:42:45,421
in front of all my friends
at my birthday

526
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:49,341
just because I dared to say that Thatcher
hadn't done such a bad job of it.

527
00:42:49,441 --> 00:42:51,526
I mean, I hadn't even voted for her.

528
00:42:52,444 --> 00:42:54,013
It wasn't funny, Kate.

529
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:55,639
No.

530
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:58,017
Very upsetting.

531
00:42:58,117 --> 00:43:00,201
He kept doing a Nazi salute.

532
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:06,499
All right, it was a little bit funny.

533
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:11,614
Oh, I'm sorry.

534
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:13,532
I shouldn't have brought it up.

535
00:43:13,632 --> 00:43:15,993
You know what Geoff's like.

536
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:18,678
He gets over-passionate about things.

537
00:43:19,638 --> 00:43:22,223
I suppose that's why
you fell in love with him.

538
00:43:24,184 --> 00:43:26,269
Yes.

539
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:39,433
Oh, er, there's another thing.

540
00:43:39,533 --> 00:43:40,976
What?

541
00:43:41,076 --> 00:43:44,522
Geoff says he's not sure
that he wants to go to the works lunch.

542
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:45,856
At Crawley's?

543
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:47,650
- But it's tomorrow.
- I know.

544
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:49,276
And it's been organised for so long.

545
00:43:49,376 --> 00:43:52,446
George was looking forward to
getting the old gang together but if...

546
00:43:52,546 --> 00:43:54,073
Well, did he say why?

547
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:56,257
Don't think so.

548
00:43:58,385 --> 00:43:59,578
I'll speak to him.

549
00:43:59,678 --> 00:44:01,247
Er, maybe it doesn't matter.

550
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:03,431
No, I'll speak to him.

551
00:44:15,611 --> 00:44:16,762
Ladies...

552
00:44:16,862 --> 00:44:18,695
Full, full?

553
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:21,616
Do you want more milk?

554
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:26,772
Yes.

555
00:44:26,872 --> 00:44:28,706
Biscuit? No?

556
00:44:30,793 --> 00:44:32,027
No?

557
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:34,572
Well, I'll leave them there.
And I'll take one.

558
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:36,198
- Thank you.
- After that,

559
00:44:36,298 --> 00:44:39,410
the merchants used these
newly created waterways,

560
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:43,539
and over the years
they were cut deeper and wider,

561
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:46,208
and this is why the Broads
are as they are today

562
00:44:46,308 --> 00:44:48,059
for all of you to enjoy.

563
00:44:48,769 --> 00:44:53,632
Now, just imagine if those Romans
had found peat elsewhere

564
00:44:53,732 --> 00:44:57,219
or chosen to dig
in another part of the country.

565
00:44:57,319 --> 00:44:59,404
Then these broads
wouldn't be here at all.

566
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,004
Is that Geoff?

567
00:46:40,297 --> 00:46:42,032
Yes, it is, yeah.

568
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:44,217
What's he doing?

569
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:46,412
Is he smoking again?

570
00:46:46,512 --> 00:46:48,638
Looks like it.

571
00:46:51,892 --> 00:46:54,685
You should get him to shave
before the big day too.

572
00:47:15,123 --> 00:47:17,750
- Hello, Geoffrey.
- Hello, Lena.

573
00:47:19,378 --> 00:47:21,447
Hope you've got your speech prepared.

574
00:47:21,547 --> 00:47:24,340
I want to hear nice things
about Kate on Saturday.

575
00:47:32,015 --> 00:47:35,017
So, I hear you don't want to
go to the Crawley's lunch.

576
00:47:38,105 --> 00:47:40,507
I don't mind if you don't,
but I wondered why.

577
00:47:40,607 --> 00:47:42,692
I just don't.

578
00:47:43,318 --> 00:47:45,763
You've been looking forward
to seeing everyone again.

579
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:47,822
You've been talking about it for weeks.

580
00:47:49,157 --> 00:47:52,102
- Why don't you want to go?
- I've got me reasons.

581
00:47:52,202 --> 00:47:53,395
Which are?

582
00:47:53,495 --> 00:47:55,981
Why does it matter to you
if I go or not?

583
00:47:56,081 --> 00:47:57,816
It doesn't, but it's been arranged.

584
00:47:57,916 --> 00:47:58,984
So?

585
00:47:59,084 --> 00:48:03,989
So you can't just back out of things
simply because you don't feel like it.

586
00:48:04,089 --> 00:48:06,473
Even when you have reasons.

587
00:48:12,472 --> 00:48:14,750
And George will be very upset.

588
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:18,170
He's... well, he's been
organising it for weeks.

589
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:20,354
- And he's your friend.
- Oh, fine.

590
00:48:21,106 --> 00:48:24,108
- Then you'll go?
- Well, that's what I said, didn't I?

591
00:48:30,115 --> 00:48:35,521
Some days, we forgot all about
getting to Italy. Just stayed put.

592
00:48:35,621 --> 00:48:37,648
We were being heedless.

593
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:40,317
I think that's the word I'm looking for.

594
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:41,610
Heedless?

595
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:43,794
Heedless.

596
00:48:44,046 --> 00:48:46,365
Back in her Berlin,
the Wall was going up

597
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:49,926
and in America
we'd just had the Bay of Pigs.

598
00:48:51,178 --> 00:48:55,473
But up there,
we weren't thinking about all that.

599
00:48:56,141 --> 00:48:58,935
Weren't thinking about our future.

600
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:02,130
But, at the same time,
we weren't heedless at all.

601
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:05,092
How can you be when,
when you know what your purpose is?

602
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:08,345
When every day seems to have
some point to it.

603
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:10,780
Finding somewhere to stay, finding food.

604
00:49:11,865 --> 00:49:13,950
And the days we didn't go anywhere,

605
00:49:14,076 --> 00:49:15,519
they seemed just as purposeful

606
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:20,915
as when we set out in complete seriousness
at four in the fucking morning.

607
00:49:21,959 --> 00:49:27,990
I think, um... I think that's
the worst part of getting decrepit,

608
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:31,717
losing that... purposefulness.

609
00:49:33,428 --> 00:49:37,974
I was remembering today
how we used to see these flowers.

610
00:49:38,725 --> 00:49:41,185
Some sort of violet, I think they were.

611
00:49:42,104 --> 00:49:46,633
They'd find a patch of grass
where the snow had melted

612
00:49:46,733 --> 00:49:48,818
and they'd just spring up.

613
00:49:49,194 --> 00:49:53,265
I know they were only flowers,
but they seemed so determined.

614
00:49:53,365 --> 00:49:55,449
Brave, even.

615
00:49:56,201 --> 00:49:59,036
And that's how I see Katya and me.

616
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:04,959
Wandering around,
turning our backs on civilisation.

617
00:50:05,627 --> 00:50:07,446
Brave?

618
00:50:07,546 --> 00:50:09,630
In a way.

619
00:50:09,881 --> 00:50:11,658
Don't you think?

620
00:50:11,758 --> 00:50:13,243
Not really.

621
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:15,287
Why not?

622
00:50:15,387 --> 00:50:17,831
I mean, what were you actually doing?

623
00:50:17,931 --> 00:50:20,599
You're just climbing up
some bloody mountain.

624
00:50:21,977 --> 00:50:25,062
Well, I'm not saying
what we did was out of bravery.

625
00:50:28,233 --> 00:50:31,610
I think you were just chasing a girl
who wanted to be chased.

626
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:41,120
You didn't know her.

627
00:50:41,955 --> 00:50:43,956
No.

628
00:50:44,624 --> 00:50:46,709
I didn't.

629
00:50:48,837 --> 00:50:50,921
I'm tired.

630
00:50:52,215 --> 00:50:54,826
I want to ask you something
before we go to sleep.

631
00:50:54,926 --> 00:50:57,011
What's that?

632
00:51:00,515 --> 00:51:05,545
If she hadn't died,
if you had got to Italy,

633
00:51:05,645 --> 00:51:07,772
would you have married her for real?

634
00:51:09,691 --> 00:51:12,344
But we didn't get to Italy, did we?

635
00:51:12,444 --> 00:51:13,887
And she did die.

636
00:51:13,987 --> 00:51:15,889
Yeah, but if you had.

637
00:51:15,989 --> 00:51:20,227
I thought you didn't
like theoretical questions.

638
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:22,369
Just answer me.

639
00:51:23,205 --> 00:51:25,289
Yes.

640
00:51:30,587 --> 00:51:32,572
Yes, you would have married her?

641
00:51:32,672 --> 00:51:34,507
Yes.

642
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:37,843
We would have married each other.

643
00:51:51,316 --> 00:51:53,734
I don't think I can
talk about her any more.

644
00:51:55,737 --> 00:51:59,782
I know I said I could, but I can't.

645
00:53:30,415 --> 00:53:32,067
Anyone you know still there?

646
00:53:32,167 --> 00:53:34,251
What? No, they're all new.

647
00:53:44,346 --> 00:53:46,039
OK, then, I'll see you later.

648
00:53:46,139 --> 00:53:47,874
Yeah.

649
00:53:47,974 --> 00:53:50,059
Hang on.

650
00:53:51,436 --> 00:53:52,921
Just try and enjoy yourself today.

651
00:53:53,021 --> 00:53:55,105
Yeah. I'll try.

652
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:21,335
Max, shut up!

653
00:59:55,925 --> 00:59:58,010
Oh...

654
01:00:58,237 --> 01:00:59,806
Hello.

655
01:00:59,906 --> 01:01:02,225
- Mrs Mercer?
- Yes, it is.

656
01:01:02,325 --> 01:01:03,977
Hi, it's George the DJ.

657
01:01:04,077 --> 01:01:06,161
Oh, yes, I meant to call you.

658
01:01:06,663 --> 01:01:08,982
I need the songs for Saturday.

659
01:01:09,082 --> 01:01:11,291
Er, song? Oh, songs, yes.

660
01:01:11,876 --> 01:01:15,321
Er... just a minute.

661
01:01:15,421 --> 01:01:17,422
Um...

662
01:01:19,926 --> 01:01:23,246
- Happy Together by The Turtles.
- OK, good choice.

663
01:01:23,346 --> 01:01:26,473
For What It's Worth
by Buffalo Springfield.

664
01:01:27,767 --> 01:01:30,644
Um, Your Precious Love by Marvin Gaye.

665
01:01:31,979 --> 01:01:34,731
And Higher And Higher by...

666
01:01:36,442 --> 01:01:37,927
I don't remember who that's by.

667
01:01:38,027 --> 01:01:39,887
Is it Jackie Wilson?

668
01:01:39,987 --> 01:01:42,015
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

669
01:01:42,115 --> 01:01:45,242
- What about Your Song by Elton John?
- No. No Elton John.

670
01:01:49,205 --> 01:01:51,289
What else? I haven't got my list.

671
01:01:56,462 --> 01:01:58,406
The Moody Blues?

672
01:01:58,506 --> 01:02:00,158
That's enough.

673
01:02:00,258 --> 01:02:02,744
What about your first dance?

674
01:02:02,844 --> 01:02:05,053
Smoke Gets In Your Eyes by The Platters.

675
01:02:05,805 --> 01:02:07,973
Yeah, thank you. Thank you so much.
Goodbye.

676
01:03:21,798 --> 01:03:23,533
How was it?

677
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:25,717
Fucking endless.

678
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:29,706
You wouldn't fucking believe
what they've done to the place.

679
01:03:29,806 --> 01:03:31,624
It's all been streamlined.

680
01:03:31,724 --> 01:03:35,002
My first job on the floor
doesn't exist any more.

681
01:03:35,102 --> 01:03:39,105
I tell you, if I was still in management,
I wouldn't have let that happen.

682
01:03:39,649 --> 01:03:41,467
And the unions, they don't give a shit.

683
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:45,070
Well, maybe they do
and nobody takes any notice.

684
01:03:50,993 --> 01:03:55,940
And how the lads have descended
into old age, it's not pretty.

685
01:03:56,040 --> 01:04:00,069
And there's George,
wanging on about his fucking ukulele.

686
01:04:00,169 --> 01:04:02,989
The worst part of it
is that they all seemed interested.

687
01:04:03,089 --> 01:04:07,452
And Len, he's got a villa
on the Algarve.

688
01:04:07,552 --> 01:04:09,245
Do you remember Red Len?

689
01:04:09,345 --> 01:04:11,080
We used to call him Len-in,

690
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:16,043
and now all he can talk about
is playing golf on the Al-fucking-garve

691
01:04:16,143 --> 01:04:18,395
with his grandson, who's a banker.

692
01:04:18,646 --> 01:04:21,883
Red Len, with a banker for a grandson.

693
01:04:21,983 --> 01:04:23,233
Fuck me!

694
01:08:36,237 --> 01:08:38,363
Hello, ladies. Have a good day, ladies.

695
01:08:39,073 --> 01:08:42,101
Would anybody like one,
this week's Big Issue?

696
01:08:42,201 --> 01:08:44,828
Could I interest you in a Big Issue?

697
01:08:45,788 --> 01:08:48,331
Would anybody like one,
this week's Big Issue?

698
01:08:57,550 --> 01:08:59,744
Good afternoon, love.
Spare a couple of minutes?

699
01:08:59,844 --> 01:09:02,580
I'd love to tell you a bit about
this charity we've got going on.

700
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:04,290
Um, I'm not interested.

701
01:09:04,390 --> 01:09:05,807
No? No problem.

702
01:09:35,963 --> 01:09:37,531
Can I help you?

703
01:09:37,631 --> 01:09:39,632
- May I sit down?
- Yeah, please do.

704
01:09:40,843 --> 01:09:43,496
- Is there somewhere you have in mind?
- No, I...

705
01:09:43,596 --> 01:09:46,457
I want to know if a man
has been in here.

706
01:09:46,557 --> 01:09:48,292
It's my husband.

707
01:09:48,392 --> 01:09:51,504
We've used you a few times
and I wondered if he'd been in.

708
01:09:51,604 --> 01:09:54,772
Um, was he enquiring about Switzerland?

709
01:11:28,784 --> 01:11:30,686
- Been a long time.
- Yeah, sorry.

710
01:11:30,786 --> 01:11:32,188
I've been...

711
01:11:32,288 --> 01:11:35,915
Well, town was very busy
and the bus back was... Sorry.

712
01:11:38,127 --> 01:11:40,112
I went to the travel agent today.

713
01:11:40,212 --> 01:11:43,214
- What?
- I went to the travel agent.

714
01:11:44,717 --> 01:11:46,801
Are you going to Switzerland?

715
01:11:50,055 --> 01:11:52,249
- No. I'm not.
- Why not?

716
01:11:52,349 --> 01:11:56,086
Well, I can't walk to the village
without... without sitting down.

717
01:11:56,186 --> 01:11:58,297
How am I going to climb
a fucking mountain?

718
01:11:58,397 --> 01:11:59,715
And that's the reason?

719
01:11:59,815 --> 01:12:01,342
No, Kate, that's not the reason.

720
01:12:01,442 --> 01:12:03,302
Because if you do go, and if I...

721
01:12:03,402 --> 01:12:05,971
Oh, Christ, Kate.
This isn't about Katya.

722
01:12:06,071 --> 01:12:08,140
Please, stop saying her name.

723
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:10,726
- I can't bear it.
- It isn't... It isn't about Katya.

724
01:12:10,826 --> 01:12:11,977
It is.

725
01:12:12,077 --> 01:12:14,162
Of course it is.

726
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:17,816
Like me discovering
what this smell is around the house.

727
01:12:17,916 --> 01:12:20,361
- Oh, please.
- And it's her perfume, OK?

728
01:12:20,461 --> 01:12:24,448
It's like she's been standing
in the corner of the room all this time,

729
01:12:24,548 --> 01:12:26,632
- behind my back.
- Oh, come on.

730
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:30,913
And it's tainted everything.

731
01:12:31,013 --> 01:12:34,667
All our decisions, where we go
on holiday, what books we read,

732
01:12:34,767 --> 01:12:37,894
what dog you want to choose,
what music we want to listen to.

733
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:40,339
And the big things, too.

734
01:12:40,439 --> 01:12:42,523
Especially the big things.

735
01:12:43,650 --> 01:12:46,569
She's had nothing to do
with any of that.

736
01:12:49,698 --> 01:12:53,868
I'd like to be able to tell you
everything I'm... thinking,

737
01:12:55,287 --> 01:12:57,022
and everything I know,

738
01:12:57,122 --> 01:12:59,207
but I can't.

739
01:12:59,625 --> 01:13:01,709
Do you understand that?

740
01:13:02,586 --> 01:13:04,670
Yeah.

741
01:13:04,797 --> 01:13:06,881
Yes, I do.

742
01:13:20,270 --> 01:13:24,925
All I want now is for you
to just come to the party tomorrow.

743
01:13:25,025 --> 01:13:27,928
- Of course I'm going to come.
- I really need you to want to be there.

744
01:13:28,028 --> 01:13:29,987
Yes, I do want to be there.

745
01:13:30,447 --> 01:13:33,267
Because it's one thing me knowing
I haven't been enough for you.

746
01:13:33,367 --> 01:13:35,451
It's something...

747
01:13:36,578 --> 01:13:39,898
...altogether different
that everyone else feels it, too.

748
01:13:39,998 --> 01:13:42,776
You really believe
you haven't been enough for me?

749
01:13:42,876 --> 01:13:44,961
No. I think I was enough for you.

750
01:13:45,921 --> 01:13:48,005
I'm just not sure you do.

751
01:13:50,259 --> 01:13:52,343
Ah, Kate.

752
01:13:53,470 --> 01:13:55,555
That's terrible.

753
01:13:58,225 --> 01:14:00,794
- Have you taken your pills today?
- No.

754
01:14:00,894 --> 01:14:03,339
Then I'm going to get them.

755
01:14:03,439 --> 01:14:07,316
And then we're going to have dinner,
and then we're going to go to bed.

756
01:14:08,026 --> 01:14:10,111
And then we're going to get up.

757
01:14:11,613 --> 01:14:13,698
And we'll try and start again.

758
01:14:14,867 --> 01:14:16,701
OK, Kate, I can do that.

759
01:14:18,996 --> 01:14:20,746
We can do that.

760
01:14:23,167 --> 01:14:25,168
I promise.

761
01:14:44,897 --> 01:14:46,090
Morning.

762
01:14:46,190 --> 01:14:47,591
I made you some tea.

763
01:14:47,691 --> 01:14:49,176
- Oh.
- And, er...

764
01:14:49,276 --> 01:14:52,904
I've managed to fix the lavatory
without cutting me finger off.

765
01:14:54,865 --> 01:14:56,767
Is it late?

766
01:14:56,867 --> 01:14:59,103
Yeah, I thought
I'd make us some scrambled eggs

767
01:14:59,203 --> 01:15:01,287
and then we can take Max for a walk.

768
01:15:01,872 --> 01:15:03,232
Oh.

769
01:15:03,332 --> 01:15:04,942
- Great.
- Right.

770
01:15:05,042 --> 01:15:07,126
Will do.

771
01:15:08,128 --> 01:15:10,338
Yeah, we have got some eggs, haven't we?

772
01:15:33,487 --> 01:15:37,057
I saw a treecreeper here,
once, a lovely little bird.

773
01:15:37,157 --> 01:15:42,563
Somebody told me that they fly down to the
bottom of the tree and work their way up.

774
01:15:42,663 --> 01:15:47,542
And nuthatches, they fly to the top of
the trunk, work their way down.

775
01:15:47,751 --> 01:15:49,835
Come on. Come on. Good boy.

776
01:15:50,087 --> 01:15:53,157
- You used to love your birdwatching.
- I did, yes.

777
01:15:53,257 --> 01:15:56,467
It's funny how you forget
the things in life that make you happy.

778
01:15:57,553 --> 01:15:59,637
Stay there, Max.

779
01:16:23,620 --> 01:16:25,705
Found it, Max.

780
01:19:56,583 --> 01:19:58,485
Again, I'm sorry
I didn't get you anything.

781
01:19:58,585 --> 01:20:00,669
Oh, don't be silly.

782
01:20:00,837 --> 01:20:02,197
This is very beautiful.

783
01:20:02,297 --> 01:20:04,381
I'm glad you like it.

784
01:20:05,383 --> 01:20:07,119
I was going to get you a watch.

785
01:20:07,219 --> 01:20:12,096
I was thinking of having it engraved,
but I wasn't sure what to write.

786
01:20:12,432 --> 01:20:14,517
I like not knowing the time.

787
01:20:56,685 --> 01:20:58,879
- I just couldn't do it.
- No.

788
01:20:58,979 --> 01:21:02,565
- Don't worry, darling, you don't have to.
- Most people don't want to.

789
01:21:39,019 --> 01:21:41,463
Will you come with me?
I've got something to show you.

790
01:21:41,563 --> 01:21:44,790
No surprises, Lena.
I don't want a surprise.

791
01:21:48,361 --> 01:21:50,764
- Wow.
- Isn't it wonderful?

792
01:21:50,864 --> 01:21:52,891
Look at this. Yes.

793
01:21:52,991 --> 01:21:55,868
- Lena, what's that?
- Ah, come and have a look.

794
01:21:58,538 --> 01:21:59,981
Wow.

795
01:22:00,081 --> 01:22:02,166
Photos.

796
01:22:02,500 --> 01:22:05,570
- Where did they all come from?
- I rang round. Everyone contributed.

797
01:22:05,670 --> 01:22:07,113
Most of them are mine.

798
01:22:07,213 --> 01:22:09,574
Look, Kate, look how beautiful you are.

799
01:22:09,674 --> 01:22:13,328
Kate, there's Tessa
when she was a puppy.

800
01:22:13,428 --> 01:22:17,165
Ah, there's me... me
and me goggles, strimming.

801
01:22:17,265 --> 01:22:18,375
Strimming.

802
01:22:18,475 --> 01:22:20,794
- Look at us there. Remember that?
- Egypt.

803
01:22:20,894 --> 01:22:22,254
Yeah, when we went to Egypt.

804
01:22:22,354 --> 01:22:24,381
Gorgeous, we both are.

805
01:22:24,481 --> 01:22:26,967
Lena, this is wonderful. Thank you.

806
01:22:27,067 --> 01:22:28,760
Not bad for an old fascist, huh?

807
01:22:28,860 --> 01:22:30,945
Yeah, not bad at all.

808
01:22:31,696 --> 01:22:34,474
- Oh, I can't wait to hear your speech.
- Yeah, it's all in here.

809
01:22:34,574 --> 01:22:37,618
- Ugh, we're all in trouble then.
- Yeah, especially you.

810
01:22:37,744 --> 01:22:39,312
Just you wait for those tears.

811
01:22:39,412 --> 01:22:41,398
- Who's that?
- That's Arthur, I think.

812
01:22:41,498 --> 01:22:42,691
- Yes, it is.
- Yes.

813
01:22:42,791 --> 01:22:46,251
- Yeah, it's Arthur, a few years ago.
- And who else do I see?

814
01:23:12,028 --> 01:23:17,116
Ladies and gentlemen,
the moment you've all been waiting for.

815
01:23:17,659 --> 01:23:20,619
I give you... Mr Geoffrey Mercer.

816
01:23:20,745 --> 01:23:22,736
Go on, Geoffrey.

817
01:23:28,003 --> 01:23:29,779
Now, can you hear me?

818
01:23:29,879 --> 01:23:31,964
- We can hear you.
- Yes.

819
01:23:32,590 --> 01:23:34,409
Oh, dear.

820
01:23:34,509 --> 01:23:36,870
I'd better try and make sense, then.

821
01:23:36,970 --> 01:23:42,349
Well, I'd like to thank you all,
first off, for being here this evening.

822
01:23:42,559 --> 01:23:47,464
Some of you may recall
that, er... my bypass,

823
01:23:47,564 --> 01:23:53,318
er, upstaged things a few years ago,
so, anyway, there we are.

824
01:23:55,238 --> 01:23:59,017
Now, er, I'm not used to
making this kind of speech

825
01:23:59,117 --> 01:24:01,811
on this, er... sort of occasion,

826
01:24:01,911 --> 01:24:04,371
but, er... well...

827
01:24:05,582 --> 01:24:07,666
I'll give it me best shot.

828
01:24:09,044 --> 01:24:12,421
As, um, as we get older,

829
01:24:13,173 --> 01:24:17,953
we seem to stop, er, making choices.

830
01:24:18,053 --> 01:24:20,163
Big ones, anyway.

831
01:24:20,263 --> 01:24:23,375
Perhaps we only get so many,
er, in a lifetime,

832
01:24:23,475 --> 01:24:27,561
and once we've used them up,
they're gone.

833
01:24:28,063 --> 01:24:33,969
Or maybe our brains, they just
get a bit, er, old and arthritic,

834
01:24:34,069 --> 01:24:37,287
like, er... like George's knee.

835
01:24:38,281 --> 01:24:40,240
Er, whatever.

836
01:24:40,742 --> 01:24:47,607
The upshot is that the choices we make
when we're young

837
01:24:47,707 --> 01:24:51,627
are pretty bloody important.

838
01:24:52,420 --> 01:24:58,092
Er, like the choice, er,
Kate and me made

839
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:02,262
45 years ago... today.

840
01:25:03,973 --> 01:25:06,058
Today.

841
01:25:10,230 --> 01:25:15,609
Now, things... things
haven't always been, er... idyllic.

842
01:25:16,569 --> 01:25:21,683
Er, like all couples, we've had
our downs as, er... as well as our ups.

843
01:25:21,783 --> 01:25:24,910
We all, we all, er, think...

844
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:28,622
We all wish we'd done some things,
er, differently,

845
01:25:28,915 --> 01:25:32,668
wish we hadn't made certain mistakes,

846
01:25:34,129 --> 01:25:36,964
but, er... whatever.

847
01:25:38,091 --> 01:25:41,844
I have to say, and I need to say,

848
01:25:43,054 --> 01:25:49,794
that persuading you,
er, to marry me, Kate,

849
01:25:49,894 --> 01:25:52,479
was the best thing I've ever done.

850
01:25:53,064 --> 01:25:55,717
Er, it took some doing, by the way.

851
01:25:55,817 --> 01:25:58,386
Yeah, so your father,
I don't think he was convinced

852
01:25:58,486 --> 01:26:00,571
I was the greatest catch in the world.

853
01:26:01,406 --> 01:26:03,558
I wonder why that was.

854
01:26:03,658 --> 01:26:07,187
But anyway, er,
persuading you to marry me

855
01:26:07,287 --> 01:26:11,066
was the best thing I've ever done,

856
01:26:11,166 --> 01:26:15,737
and, er, I'm sorry, I truly am,

857
01:26:15,837 --> 01:26:20,867
that, er, you haven't, er...
you haven't always known that

858
01:26:20,967 --> 01:26:24,329
because, er, well, for me, Kate,

859
01:26:24,429 --> 01:26:29,918
this is, er, this is what it's... what
it's all about, what all this is about,

860
01:26:30,018 --> 01:26:33,588
why all... why all our friends
are here this evening.

861
01:26:33,688 --> 01:26:37,232
It's about, er... it's about you and me.

862
01:26:38,860 --> 01:26:40,970
You and me, Kate.

863
01:26:41,070 --> 01:26:42,889
Us.

864
01:26:42,989 --> 01:26:44,682
Yeah.

865
01:26:44,782 --> 01:26:48,561
And I think, really,
that's about all I've, er... got to say,

866
01:26:48,661 --> 01:26:51,747
except that, er... I love you.

867
01:26:53,208 --> 01:26:55,292
Aw.

868
01:26:58,213 --> 01:26:59,572
I love you very much.

869
01:26:59,672 --> 01:27:03,910
And thank you for standing by me
through all these years

870
01:27:04,010 --> 01:27:08,680
and putting up with all my nonsense,
and, er... long may it continue.

871
01:27:16,064 --> 01:27:17,549
Geoff and Kate!

872
01:27:17,649 --> 01:27:19,733
Geoff and Kate!

873
01:27:27,659 --> 01:27:30,687
It was fantastic. Wasn't it?

874
01:27:30,787 --> 01:27:32,871
It was.

875
01:27:53,226 --> 01:27:55,086
And now...

876
01:27:55,186 --> 01:27:59,757
would the two lovebirds kindly
take to the floor for the first dance?

877
01:27:59,857 --> 01:28:00,967
Aw.

878
01:28:01,067 --> 01:28:05,221
And for those of you that don't know,
or weren't alive,

879
01:28:05,321 --> 01:28:10,560
this is the very same song
that was played 45 years ago today.

880
01:28:10,660 --> 01:28:12,395
Aw.

881
01:28:12,495 --> 01:28:15,778
I give you Mr and Mrs Mercer.
