1
00:00:29,913 --> 00:00:33,849
This is New Country 95.5,
country from the heart...

2
00:00:34,017 --> 00:00:36,417
...sending out a big welcome
to all the hopefuls...

3
00:00:36,586 --> 00:00:39,350
...for the 2003 World Series of Poker.

4
00:00:39,522 --> 00:00:43,788
Here 's a George Jones classic
for all you players in the game of cards...

5
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:45,727
...or the game of love.

6
00:01:14,724 --> 00:01:15,748
Evening.

7
00:01:17,193 --> 00:01:18,751
One-fifty.

8
00:01:18,928 --> 00:01:20,555
Brand new. Never been used.

9
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:23,790
I got three of them. One-fifty.

10
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:26,492
-It cost 500.
-1 50.

11
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:29,995
-I need three.
-Sorry.

12
00:01:35,311 --> 00:01:37,438
You have three digital cameras.

13
00:01:37,614 --> 00:01:39,377
-AII the same.
-Pretty much.

14
00:01:39,549 --> 00:01:42,450
Well, here's what
you can do with four cameras...

15
00:01:42,619 --> 00:01:44,109
...that you can't do with three.

16
00:01:45,488 --> 00:01:48,946
You take two of the cameras,
you price them identically.

17
00:01:49,125 --> 00:01:53,289
The third camera, you price a Iittle Iess.
The fourth camera, you price a Iittle higher.

18
00:01:53,463 --> 00:01:56,455
Customer comes in
wanting to buy a camera.

19
00:01:56,633 --> 00:01:59,193
Figures the Ieast expensive camera's
either a bargain...

20
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,132
...or there's something wrong with it.

21
00:02:01,304 --> 00:02:05,070
But it gets him thinking.
It gets him talking to you.

22
00:02:05,241 --> 00:02:08,540
In other words,
you've got him in the game.

23
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:13,172
Odds are, he doesn't take camera number
three because he reads it as defective.

24
00:02:13,349 --> 00:02:15,817
But it pushes him towards cameras
one and two...

25
00:02:15,985 --> 00:02:18,010
...which he already thinks
are a good deal...

26
00:02:18,188 --> 00:02:20,679
...because of the higher price
of camera number four.

27
00:02:20,857 --> 00:02:22,848
Or maybe he's
drawn to camera number four.

28
00:02:23,026 --> 00:02:25,085
I mean,
why is this camera more expensive?

29
00:02:25,261 --> 00:02:26,922
You tell him it's never been used.

30
00:02:27,096 --> 00:02:30,088
You point out that cameras one
and two have never been used...

31
00:02:30,266 --> 00:02:35,226
...the only difference is,
camera number four is still in the box.

32
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:37,737
Now, he does one of two things.

33
00:02:38,274 --> 00:02:41,004
He either buys one of your cameras
at the regular price...

34
00:02:41,177 --> 00:02:43,111
...which he now thinks is a bargain...

35
00:02:43,279 --> 00:02:46,476
...or, he springs for the one in the box...

36
00:02:46,649 --> 00:02:49,243
...because he plans to give it
to someone as a present...

37
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:51,717
...and he needs the box
so it Iooks new...

38
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:55,819
...and not Iike some camera
he just picked up at a pawn shop.

39
00:02:58,661 --> 00:03:00,026
You're good.

40
00:03:00,196 --> 00:03:04,155
So by purchasing this camera in its box...

41
00:03:04,334 --> 00:03:07,735
...you increase the value
of the three cameras you already have.

42
00:03:09,138 --> 00:03:10,969
You work this hard at your day job?

43
00:03:13,176 --> 00:03:18,045
Only problem is,
my cameras all have boxes.

44
00:03:25,822 --> 00:03:27,187
What?

45
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:28,648
I'II tell you what.

46
00:03:29,492 --> 00:03:33,861
If you can show me your boxes,
I'II give you my camera for nothing.

47
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:37,397
But, if you can't,
you pay three bills for mine.

48
00:03:38,768 --> 00:03:40,736
You're pretty sure of yourself.

49
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:44,432
You don't have the boxes, do you?

50
00:03:47,677 --> 00:03:50,908
I'II give you the 1 50,
plus 50 for the entertainment...

51
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,513
...but that's as high as I go.

52
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:54,950
Done.

53
00:04:05,962 --> 00:04:07,224
What about this?

54
00:04:09,132 --> 00:04:10,861
What's it worth?

55
00:04:11,034 --> 00:04:12,058
To me or to you?

56
00:04:12,235 --> 00:04:14,726
Well, it's worth a Iot to me.
It was my mother's.

57
00:04:14,904 --> 00:04:16,769
She used to take it off...

58
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:19,773
...and then one day my dad
took off with it to get some cash.

59
00:04:20,476 --> 00:04:21,909
How did you get it?

60
00:04:22,946 --> 00:04:25,972
I won it off him in a poker game.

61
00:04:26,316 --> 00:04:28,443
It was too Iate
to do my mom any good, though.

62
00:04:29,619 --> 00:04:31,519
Sorry to hear that.

63
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:33,178
PIain band. Nothing special.

64
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:35,790
I could give you a hundred,
you'II have your three.

65
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:39,395
-He told me it was worth more than that.
-So sell it back to him.

66
00:04:39,562 --> 00:04:42,463
I'm not selling it to you.
I'II be back for it.

67
00:04:44,133 --> 00:04:45,191
What's your name?

68
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:47,726
Huck.

69
00:04:48,071 --> 00:04:52,804
Well, Huck, I'II give you another
buck and a half for the ring...

70
00:04:53,176 --> 00:04:56,612
...and you have 1 20 days
to come back and see me.

71
00:06:33,743 --> 00:06:35,005
Hey, Huck.

72
00:06:50,193 --> 00:06:53,162
There'II be a seat available at
table four in just a few minutes.

73
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:55,923
-Thank you.
-Eight to call.

74
00:06:58,334 --> 00:07:00,461
What time can you have it here?

75
00:07:00,803 --> 00:07:04,295
AII right. If that's the best you can do.
Get it here as soon as you can.

76
00:07:09,112 --> 00:07:11,706
Beating up on a whale.
Some real estate guy from FIorida.

77
00:07:11,881 --> 00:07:13,508
I guess you could call that a tell.

78
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:16,174
He's stuck a quarter mil and change.

79
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,680
I'm down
with the Iittle fish tonight, Tommy.

80
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:21,983
-Swimming with the guppies for awhile.
-Okay, kid. Good Iuck.

81
00:07:30,733 --> 00:07:31,859
Three-Fifty.

82
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:34,332
Small blind. Big blind.
Sir, you wanna post?

83
00:07:34,504 --> 00:07:35,903
Yeah.

84
00:07:42,178 --> 00:07:45,113
-Water, Huck?
-Yeah, thanks.

85
00:07:46,649 --> 00:07:47,911
I raise.

86
00:07:50,253 --> 00:07:51,845
Well, Iet's raise it up, then.

87
00:07:52,622 --> 00:07:54,487
-Fold.
-That's a good decision. You too.

88
00:07:54,657 --> 00:07:57,023
AII very good decisions.
Especially you, water boy.

89
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:09,965
How do you Iike that river, water boy?

90
00:08:14,177 --> 00:08:16,077
Sixteen is the bet.

91
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,173
It'II only hurt for a Iittle while.

92
00:08:20,983 --> 00:08:22,917
Really.

93
00:08:25,988 --> 00:08:29,480
You're betting Iike you have the eight
for the belly straight.

94
00:08:29,659 --> 00:08:32,127
Or you might have caught
a third seven.

95
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:36,530
No matter how I Iook at it,
you probably got me beat.

96
00:08:39,635 --> 00:08:41,364
Then again...

97
00:08:43,673 --> 00:08:44,731
...maybe you don't.

98
00:08:46,242 --> 00:08:48,437
It's raised to 32.

99
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:50,044
Thank you.

100
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:57,476
Screw it.

101
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:05,154
Never touch another player's cards.

102
00:09:05,328 --> 00:09:08,422
Nothing. You raised me with nothing?

103
00:09:09,699 --> 00:09:11,667
Sometimes nothing's enough.

104
00:09:14,837 --> 00:09:17,863
-Let's Iine them up, please.
-Show cards, please.

105
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:20,302
Pair of queens.

106
00:09:21,844 --> 00:09:24,472
Maverick. Jacks and queens.
Two pair is good, sir.

107
00:09:26,415 --> 00:09:27,905
The winner.

108
00:09:33,122 --> 00:09:34,714
Thank you.

109
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:39,122
Gentlemen. It's great to be alive, isn't it?

110
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,224
Raise.

111
00:10:00,549 --> 00:10:02,483
Sometime today, sunshine.

112
00:10:03,419 --> 00:10:04,545
You in a hurry?

113
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:08,380
PIaces to go? People to see?

114
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,720
Maybe.

115
00:10:12,094 --> 00:10:15,393
Let's see if we can get you there
a Iittle faster, cowboy.

116
00:10:16,732 --> 00:10:18,324
Raise.

117
00:10:21,637 --> 00:10:22,729
Back at you.

118
00:10:33,683 --> 00:10:35,207
Giddap.

119
00:10:39,922 --> 00:10:43,551
Okay, it's eight, 1 0,000...

120
00:10:46,329 --> 00:10:49,389
...two hundred and twenty-eight.
Do you want that in cash or chips?

121
00:10:50,099 --> 00:10:52,329
Give me the ten in chips, Larita.

122
00:10:53,102 --> 00:10:55,969
Robin, grab Huck's box for me, please.

123
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:02,074
-What time's your shift end?
-Not for another three hours.

124
00:11:03,446 --> 00:11:05,937
My first bad beat tonight.

125
00:11:08,984 --> 00:11:10,110
Get it over.

126
00:11:12,955 --> 00:11:16,015
-What was that?
-Here you go. Here you go.

127
00:11:16,192 --> 00:11:20,492
AII right, the over and under is three.
AII right, I got the under, who's got over?

128
00:11:21,564 --> 00:11:23,361
-Hey, Huck. How you doing?
-Hey, Eddie.

129
00:11:23,532 --> 00:11:26,126
Hey, three times over the net pays off,
five pays double.

130
00:11:26,302 --> 00:11:29,135
-You want some of the action? Okay.
-No thanks, Eddie.

131
00:11:29,305 --> 00:11:31,739
AII right, all right.
Who's got ponytail's side?

132
00:11:31,907 --> 00:11:34,068
That's payday. That's payday.

133
00:11:35,044 --> 00:11:37,535
Come on, you can do better than that.

134
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:41,083
Smell this, it's new.

135
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,782
-Smells good, right?
-Yes.

136
00:11:47,223 --> 00:11:49,691
But it's not cologne
or deodorant or anything...

137
00:11:49,859 --> 00:11:51,656
...it's just me.

138
00:11:51,827 --> 00:11:53,954
It's just Iike my natural--
I know it's weird--

139
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:57,327
Sorry. Time got away from me.

140
00:11:59,668 --> 00:12:00,760
It happens.

141
00:12:00,936 --> 00:12:03,336
I know, but I keep saying
it won't happen again.

142
00:12:03,506 --> 00:12:05,133
But it does.

143
00:12:06,275 --> 00:12:07,867
And I'm Iate.

144
00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:11,406
So you guys are...?

145
00:12:14,183 --> 00:12:15,650
Yeah.

146
00:12:18,254 --> 00:12:21,314
-Nice to have met you.
-Nice to have met you.

147
00:12:23,926 --> 00:12:26,918
Do you always intrude
on private conversations?

148
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:29,964
Well, it seemed Iike an intrusion
might be welcome.

149
00:12:30,132 --> 00:12:31,963
So you're a mind reader?

150
00:12:32,134 --> 00:12:37,094
Body. Your body Ianguage indicated
a certain Iack of enthusiasm.

151
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,039
You might have been wrong.

152
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:43,903
-Huck.
-Billie.

153
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:46,013
-New in town?
-No.

154
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,308
Really?

155
00:12:47,483 --> 00:12:49,348
See, you are wrong
every once in a while.

156
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:51,452
Hey, sorry I'm Iate.

157
00:12:52,555 --> 00:12:55,023
That's what he just said.

158
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:59,287
Yeah, but he's a poker player, Billie,
so you can't believe anything he says.

159
00:12:59,462 --> 00:13:02,192
-Busted. Suzanne.
-How you doing, Huck?

160
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:05,697
-Great, now that I've met your friend.
-My sister.

161
00:13:07,269 --> 00:13:09,829
-Your sister?
-My Iittle sister.

162
00:13:11,774 --> 00:13:13,639
Little sister. Even better.

163
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:17,078
Ginger. Hey.

164
00:13:18,781 --> 00:13:20,976
-Hey, Huck.
-Ginger.

165
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:23,914
This is my sister, Billie.
She just got in from Bakersfield.

166
00:13:24,854 --> 00:13:27,721
-This is Gary.
-Hey, you work at the....

167
00:13:28,991 --> 00:13:32,256
-At the Venetian. You're the gondola guy.
-That was Iast year.

168
00:13:32,428 --> 00:13:35,261
I'm a Nubian slave at The Luxor now.

169
00:13:35,431 --> 00:13:37,399
-We gotta go.
-Nice to meet you.

170
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:39,397
Nice to meet you.

171
00:13:39,969 --> 00:13:42,130
-See you Saturday at the party?
-Yeah.

172
00:13:42,304 --> 00:13:44,465
Hope you enjoy your visit.

173
00:13:45,174 --> 00:13:46,766
Suzanne.

174
00:13:47,877 --> 00:13:49,970
That was a fast withdrawal.

175
00:13:50,145 --> 00:13:52,943
Yeah, well,
Huck's not one to waste any time.

176
00:13:53,115 --> 00:13:54,412
Boy, you're up.

177
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:57,313
You're my sister,
there's no way I'm Ietting that happen.

178
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:59,310
Bad news?

179
00:13:59,955 --> 00:14:02,981
There's quite a few
who would say it's a good time.

180
00:14:03,158 --> 00:14:05,649
-Does that include you?
-No.

181
00:14:05,828 --> 00:14:07,796
I had Huck's number pretty early on.

182
00:14:07,963 --> 00:14:12,263
-What number is that?
-Hustle 1 0, commitment zero.

183
00:14:13,569 --> 00:14:15,560
Maybe he hasn't found
what he's Iooking for.

184
00:14:15,738 --> 00:14:18,639
Billie, no.
Don't even think about it.

185
00:14:18,807 --> 00:14:20,707
Come on,
we've been through this before.

186
00:14:20,876 --> 00:14:24,107
Some people don't wanna be fixed.

187
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,214
They Iike things just the way they are.

188
00:14:43,566 --> 00:14:45,227
French toast. Bacon on the side.

189
00:14:45,401 --> 00:14:49,701
Fruit. Strawberries only.
Hang on a second, Lucy.

190
00:14:49,872 --> 00:14:52,432
Why don't you just go rest up a Iittle?
We never close.

191
00:14:52,608 --> 00:14:54,098
No time Iike the present, Tommy.

192
00:14:54,276 --> 00:14:56,801
Oh, I should've gotten
away from that.

193
00:14:58,213 --> 00:15:00,238
-Hey, Huck.
-Hi, Huck.

194
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:02,509
-Have a seat.
-What's going on, Huck?

195
00:15:02,685 --> 00:15:04,676
Fasten your seatbelts. Huck is here.

196
00:15:05,054 --> 00:15:09,081
What's for breakfast?
And don't say "you are."

197
00:15:18,701 --> 00:15:19,998
Eighty-six for Iow.

198
00:15:20,903 --> 00:15:22,803
Eighty-seven.

199
00:15:23,572 --> 00:15:26,666
-Ace wins for high.
-You win the whole pot.

200
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:28,309
Nice deck.

201
00:15:28,477 --> 00:15:30,502
-Look who's here.
-Good morning, gentlemen.

202
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:32,613
-Well, he's back.
-Hey, good to see you.

203
00:15:32,781 --> 00:15:35,375
-What's going on?
-Good to see you.

204
00:15:35,551 --> 00:15:38,486
Big Buckle, good to see you.
Sammy, Chau.

205
00:15:38,654 --> 00:15:41,714
-Good to see you.
-Michelle, my belle.

206
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:44,984
Oh, I've missed you, L.C.
You in town for the tournament?

207
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:49,722
Yeah, well, someone's gotta try
and stem the tide of those couch potatoes.

208
00:15:49,898 --> 00:15:53,595
-Is there an empty seat?
-Right here between me and Chau.

209
00:15:54,403 --> 00:15:55,927
Twenty thousand.

210
00:15:56,105 --> 00:15:58,938
Couldn't go another World Series
without you, L.C.

211
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:02,134
So how was the south of France?

212
00:16:03,278 --> 00:16:04,472
French.

213
00:16:04,647 --> 00:16:07,138
They hate our politics,
but they Iove our games...

214
00:16:07,316 --> 00:16:09,409
...I'm happy to say.

215
00:16:11,286 --> 00:16:14,016
Yeah, Iooks Iike the kid
has got the jump on everybody.

216
00:16:14,189 --> 00:16:15,213
He's really hot.

217
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:18,656
-What's new and different, kid?
-Your hair, for one thing.

218
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:22,990
Kid tries to bring out the worst in people.

219
00:16:23,165 --> 00:16:28,660
As I get on in years, Iike all human beings,
I become acquainted with vanity.

220
00:16:31,974 --> 00:16:33,601
How about you? Still blasting away?

221
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,207
Thousand to go.

222
00:16:37,513 --> 00:16:38,980
Re-raise.

223
00:16:39,548 --> 00:16:41,345
Nice to play with you again, kid.

224
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:43,608
What do you say, fellas?

225
00:16:43,786 --> 00:16:45,879
Not a spectator sport.

226
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:00,599
Five thousand.

227
00:17:02,337 --> 00:17:03,395
How deep are you?

228
00:17:05,174 --> 00:17:07,039
Oh, I've got about eighteen thousand.

229
00:17:10,145 --> 00:17:11,578
Okay.

230
00:17:12,715 --> 00:17:14,376
I'm putting you all-in.

231
00:17:17,753 --> 00:17:20,153
Well, I'm gonna have to call you, L.C...

232
00:17:20,322 --> 00:17:23,689
...because my pretty Iadies
are just dying to step out.

233
00:17:23,859 --> 00:17:27,522
Well, they'II be in good company.

234
00:17:28,097 --> 00:17:30,224
Three Kings.

235
00:17:31,734 --> 00:17:33,702
You son of a bitch.

236
00:17:34,436 --> 00:17:37,405
You're the only man
I enjoy Iosing money to.

237
00:17:39,742 --> 00:17:41,004
Loan me twenty, L.C.?

238
00:17:49,885 --> 00:17:51,648
Is there anybody who doesn't owe you?

239
00:17:52,588 --> 00:17:55,386
Just you, kid. Just you.

240
00:18:03,465 --> 00:18:04,955
Raise you 60.

241
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,137
Eight thousand.

242
00:18:20,415 --> 00:18:22,178
It's an interesting situation.

243
00:18:23,218 --> 00:18:25,652
I had you sitting
with a medium pocket pair.

244
00:18:25,821 --> 00:18:29,780
Nines wired, perhaps,
which would give you a set.

245
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:33,121
You had me figured for a straight draw.
Now, the question is:

246
00:18:33,295 --> 00:18:34,887
Am I four to a flush, too?

247
00:18:35,063 --> 00:18:38,055
With a pot this size,
I'II call you no matter what you raise.

248
00:18:38,233 --> 00:18:42,602
The prudent thing would be
to just call, protect your chips...

249
00:18:42,771 --> 00:18:45,740
...so you can play again, another day.

250
00:18:46,642 --> 00:18:50,009
No, Prudence, the question is...

251
00:18:50,179 --> 00:18:53,342
...you talking because you got
the diamonds, or because you don't?

252
00:18:53,749 --> 00:18:56,479
You and I both know
what the book says you should do, kid.

253
00:18:56,652 --> 00:18:57,914
Is that what you do now?

254
00:18:58,086 --> 00:19:02,386
Just play by the book?
You might as well play online.

255
00:19:03,192 --> 00:19:04,750
Raise.

256
00:19:04,927 --> 00:19:06,155
I'm all-in.

257
00:19:06,328 --> 00:19:09,263
You sure?
Now, you can pull it back if you want.

258
00:19:09,431 --> 00:19:10,693
I'd bet more if I had it.

259
00:19:11,466 --> 00:19:13,263
-You would?
-Yeah.

260
00:19:13,435 --> 00:19:15,426
I'II Iet you throw in
that charm of yours...

261
00:19:15,604 --> 00:19:17,629
...that wedding ring
you're fond of carrying.

262
00:19:17,806 --> 00:19:21,139
AIthough, I notice
you don't have it with you.

263
00:19:25,881 --> 00:19:27,644
You're right, I don't.

264
00:19:29,885 --> 00:19:32,581
But I'II put up the pawn ticket
that redeems it...

265
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:35,723
...against that wristwatch
you're wearing.

266
00:19:35,891 --> 00:19:37,290
Yeah?

267
00:19:37,459 --> 00:19:39,359
Okay. May I?

268
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:53,974
Get out of here.

269
00:19:56,211 --> 00:19:58,179
A buck and a half?

270
00:19:58,347 --> 00:20:00,941
You must have been up against it, kid.

271
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:04,578
I know that ring's worth a Iot more
than that to you.

272
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:08,279
And my watch is worth a Iot more
than that to me.

273
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:11,255
My father's 1 938 Bulova.

274
00:20:11,426 --> 00:20:14,953
He wore it through the war,
but I'II take that bet.

275
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:16,256
Anybody mind?

276
00:20:16,431 --> 00:20:18,194
Are you kidding? Come on.

277
00:20:18,367 --> 00:20:20,062
This is between you two.

278
00:20:20,235 --> 00:20:22,465
But we're happy to watch.

279
00:20:23,005 --> 00:20:24,495
So insane.

280
00:20:27,075 --> 00:20:28,337
I got you covered.

281
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:34,940
Possible flush...

282
00:20:36,285 --> 00:20:38,617
...open-ended straight draw.

283
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:44,683
How are you fixed?

284
00:20:47,596 --> 00:20:49,325
Pocket nines.

285
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:50,795
Imagine that.

286
00:20:53,135 --> 00:20:54,966
Let's see the river.

287
00:20:57,472 --> 00:20:59,303
Diamond flush, the winner.

288
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:01,536
That hurts.

289
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:03,507
Too bad, Huckleberry.

290
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,443
Sometimes it pays to be prudent.

291
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:19,287
Hey, Huck,
you know what your problem is?

292
00:21:19,461 --> 00:21:20,519
You.

293
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:22,561
You're a great player.
You know the math.

294
00:21:22,731 --> 00:21:25,393
You read your opponents
as well as anybody I've ever seen.

295
00:21:25,567 --> 00:21:28,468
The trouble is you're a blaster.
You always have been.

296
00:21:28,637 --> 00:21:29,797
Thanks for the analysis.

297
00:21:29,972 --> 00:21:32,463
Listen, go for broke,
you're gonna wind up broke.

298
00:21:32,641 --> 00:21:35,041
He drew Iucky.
I caught a case of second best.

299
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:36,268
You want sympathy...

300
00:21:36,445 --> 00:21:39,380
...you'II find it between
shit and syphilis in the dictionary.

301
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:41,607
If you don't Ieave
your volatility at home...

302
00:21:41,783 --> 00:21:44,513
-...you'II never be in the same Ieague--
-What do you want?

303
00:21:44,686 --> 00:21:46,415
I want you to play with my money.

304
00:21:46,588 --> 00:21:48,920
It'II even you out.
It'II make you a better player.

305
00:21:49,091 --> 00:21:52,151
Your money's not involved,
your emotions will be Iess involved.

306
00:21:52,327 --> 00:21:57,060
I'II stake you the ten grand buy-in
to the World Series, we split the winnings.

307
00:21:57,733 --> 00:22:00,361
Let me ask you something,
how much do you weigh?

308
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:02,995
Oh, 1 50, give or take a Iittle.

309
00:22:03,605 --> 00:22:04,936
How much you think I weigh?

310
00:22:09,277 --> 00:22:11,802
-One-eighty-five.
-One-eighty-five.

311
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:14,574
Now you tell me,
how well do you think I'm gonna play...

312
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:18,117
...with an additional 1 50 pounds
on my back?

313
00:22:18,286 --> 00:22:20,379
Give or take a Iittle.

314
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:31,262
That is an arbitration clause,
but it may not be binding here.

315
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:34,334
We may be in Iuck. Why don't
you read me paragraph two again...

316
00:22:34,503 --> 00:22:36,027
...one more time from the top.

317
00:22:36,204 --> 00:22:38,536
-Hope this isn't about money.
-You got any money?

318
00:22:38,707 --> 00:22:40,641
It's good to see you, Huckster.

319
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:43,569
-1 -900-Mental.
-Is this a real psychologist?

320
00:22:43,745 --> 00:22:46,908
Yes, all of our psychologists
are board certified and accredited.

321
00:22:47,082 --> 00:22:49,277
-That's a relief, because--
-One moment, please.

322
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:50,782
Okay.

323
00:22:52,387 --> 00:22:54,446
-1 -900-Defend. PIease hold.
-I have a--

324
00:22:56,091 --> 00:22:59,117
Yes. This is Dr. Shuman.
May I ask your name?

325
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:00,556
Yeah, Toby.

326
00:23:00,729 --> 00:23:02,196
What seems to be the problem?

327
00:23:02,364 --> 00:23:04,355
-It's my girlfriend.
-Come on, Jack.

328
00:23:04,533 --> 00:23:07,764
Turn into 1 -900-Loan, spot me a thousand
to get me going again.

329
00:23:07,936 --> 00:23:09,733
What did I just tell you?

330
00:23:09,905 --> 00:23:12,135
-Dr. Shuman, are you there?
-Sorry, Toby, yes.

331
00:23:12,307 --> 00:23:15,435
-When I drive by, she's out.
-What do you think she's telling you...

332
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:17,840
-...with this chronic behavior?
-I don 't know.

333
00:23:18,013 --> 00:23:20,948
I'm wondering if I shouldn't put you
on with our relationship...

334
00:23:21,116 --> 00:23:23,949
...and commitment therapist,
Dr. Gregory.

335
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:25,643
-Okay.
-Keep him talking.

336
00:23:27,556 --> 00:23:30,024
-You're playing a Iosing hand.
-Really, you think so?

337
00:23:30,192 --> 00:23:32,422
This is a case of throwing
good money after bad.

338
00:23:32,594 --> 00:23:35,654
-You should just get out, Toby.
-Thanks, doctor.

339
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:39,130
Hold on one moment. Our contract
specialist will be with you presently.

340
00:23:39,801 --> 00:23:41,029
-What are you doing?
-What?

341
00:23:41,203 --> 00:23:44,730
Rule number one, be a Iistener. Listen.

342
00:23:44,906 --> 00:23:48,808
-I can't help you. I want to, but I can't.
-Jack, come on, you know I'm good for it.

343
00:23:48,977 --> 00:23:51,639
Why does everyone
try to take advantage of me?

344
00:23:52,581 --> 00:23:56,642
Cheryl, I am hearing you
express your pain...

345
00:23:56,818 --> 00:23:58,183
...and I'm feeling empathy.

346
00:23:58,353 --> 00:24:00,014
You understand, don 't you, doctor?

347
00:24:00,188 --> 00:24:04,056
Yes. From my own experience,
I know how disheartening it is...

348
00:24:04,226 --> 00:24:07,127
...to feel that you're being
taken advantage of by friends.

349
00:24:07,295 --> 00:24:10,662
-All they do is take from me.
-Exactly, Cheryl.

350
00:24:10,832 --> 00:24:14,461
When the motives become monetary,
it's parasitic.

351
00:24:14,636 --> 00:24:16,297
It is parasitic.

352
00:24:16,471 --> 00:24:19,963
Julie split and took the kids.
I think she means it this time.

353
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:22,366
-She always means it.
-No, I'm telling you.

354
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:25,672
She does not even wanna talk
about talking about it.

355
00:24:26,982 --> 00:24:29,109
You might need to dial 1 -900-It's-Over.

356
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:33,385
Thanks.

357
00:24:35,223 --> 00:24:37,555
I don't even go to restaurants.

358
00:24:38,193 --> 00:24:40,354
-You okay?
-I don 't have anybody to talk to.

359
00:24:40,529 --> 00:24:41,894
No.

360
00:24:44,533 --> 00:24:45,830
Don't you ever get Ionely?

361
00:24:46,001 --> 00:24:48,936
I don 't know what
I'm gonna do with myself.

362
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:52,938
I feel as though I'm stuck here
waiting for my life to start.

363
00:24:53,108 --> 00:24:57,602
-If I could just hit a button....
-With friends Iike you? Never.

364
00:24:57,812 --> 00:25:00,872
-Still not getting nickel one.
-Damn.

365
00:25:03,251 --> 00:25:06,709
That's not fair to you, Cheryl.
Are you gonna accept that?

366
00:25:15,964 --> 00:25:17,397
You Iocked out?

367
00:25:17,566 --> 00:25:20,034
Either that,
or I just enjoy sitting on staircases.

368
00:25:20,569 --> 00:25:22,730
How Iong before Suzanne will be back?

369
00:25:22,904 --> 00:25:24,269
I don't know.

370
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:27,636
-She was gonna Ioan me some money.
-Oh, yeah?

371
00:25:29,711 --> 00:25:33,147
Well, I've got...

372
00:25:33,315 --> 00:25:35,112
...$1 9, is that enough?

373
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:38,275
That's all you brought with you?

374
00:25:39,221 --> 00:25:41,212
And a thousand dollars
in traveler's checks.

375
00:25:44,926 --> 00:25:45,950
Excuse me.

376
00:25:46,661 --> 00:25:48,094
Hello?

377
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:50,994
Yes. This is she.

378
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,894
Yes. Hello.

379
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:57,868
Tonight? Yes.

380
00:26:00,075 --> 00:26:01,906
AII right. Thank you very much.

381
00:26:02,077 --> 00:26:05,877
I got a job. Singing at Dean's.

382
00:26:06,047 --> 00:26:07,605
-Dino's?
-You know the place?

383
00:26:07,782 --> 00:26:08,942
Sure.

384
00:26:09,451 --> 00:26:11,976
It's my first job singing professionally.

385
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:15,247
Oh, we should celebrate.
This is an occasion.

386
00:26:15,423 --> 00:26:17,914
You're right. It is.

387
00:26:18,093 --> 00:26:19,185
Well, Iet's go.

388
00:26:20,629 --> 00:26:22,392
Good Iuck to you.

389
00:26:23,231 --> 00:26:24,994
Thank you.

390
00:26:26,268 --> 00:26:28,930
Discipline's the key.
We have serious celebrating to do...

391
00:26:29,104 --> 00:26:32,073
...so we only play
until we double our money.

392
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:36,609
-Do you know how to play poker?
-I know that three of a kind beats two pair.

393
00:26:36,778 --> 00:26:38,609
Very good.

394
00:26:41,182 --> 00:26:43,980
Binion's Horseshoe Casino
in downtown Las Vegas...

395
00:26:44,152 --> 00:26:46,586
...proud home
of the World Series of Poker.

396
00:26:46,755 --> 00:26:51,749
The 2003 Omaha event will commence
in two hours in Benny's Bullpen.

397
00:26:52,994 --> 00:26:54,825
BIinds, please.

398
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:01,131
Okay. In T exas Hold ' Em...

399
00:27:01,303 --> 00:27:04,500
...each player gets two cards
that no one else sees.

400
00:27:04,673 --> 00:27:08,006
Then five cards are dealt
face up on the table.

401
00:27:08,176 --> 00:27:10,838
Now, these are cards
that everybody can use.

402
00:27:11,012 --> 00:27:12,980
If you think you have
the best two cards...

403
00:27:13,148 --> 00:27:16,117
...or two cards
you'd Iike to draw to, you bet.

404
00:27:16,284 --> 00:27:18,684
And, if you don't, you fold.

405
00:27:27,095 --> 00:27:28,653
Raise.

406
00:27:30,131 --> 00:27:31,564
Call.

407
00:27:35,203 --> 00:27:36,500
Four players.

408
00:27:43,712 --> 00:27:44,940
-Check.
-Check.

409
00:27:47,982 --> 00:27:50,951
If, for instance,
someone had a king in the hole...

410
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:55,385
...they'd now have two pair.
kings and fours.

411
00:27:56,157 --> 00:27:59,092
One more heart and you've got a flush.

412
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:13,396
That's right. Of course, the trick
is to not Iet the other players know...

413
00:28:13,575 --> 00:28:15,406
-...when you got something good.
-Okay.

414
00:28:15,577 --> 00:28:18,705
Hence the expression, "poker face."

415
00:28:25,086 --> 00:28:26,815
Three players.

416
00:28:36,765 --> 00:28:38,062
-Check.
-Check it.

417
00:28:42,337 --> 00:28:43,964
Forty.

418
00:28:47,342 --> 00:28:49,367
Raise it to 80.

419
00:28:50,745 --> 00:28:52,235
I call.

420
00:28:53,882 --> 00:28:55,509
Call 80.

421
00:29:07,061 --> 00:29:08,551
-Check.
-Check it.

422
00:29:09,697 --> 00:29:11,062
Check it.

423
00:29:11,466 --> 00:29:13,559
-What are you doing?
-Forty.

424
00:29:15,203 --> 00:29:16,795
I'II raise.

425
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:19,140
Raise it to 80.

426
00:29:19,874 --> 00:29:22,934
I give her a king and a queen in the hole
for an ace-high straight.

427
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:26,279
-Yeah?
-Fold.

428
00:29:26,448 --> 00:29:28,712
I call.
I've got Broderick Crawford.

429
00:29:28,883 --> 00:29:30,214
Tens and fours. Two pair.

430
00:29:31,085 --> 00:29:32,211
A straight.

431
00:29:34,823 --> 00:29:37,656
Ace-high straight. The winner.

432
00:29:39,461 --> 00:29:41,053
Nice hand.

433
00:29:41,229 --> 00:29:42,890
Over and out.

434
00:29:43,798 --> 00:29:45,789
How did you know?

435
00:29:45,967 --> 00:29:49,835
It was the way she bet before the flop,
and the way she bet after the flop.

436
00:29:50,004 --> 00:29:54,100
A good fold is as important as a win.
Sometimes more important.

437
00:29:54,776 --> 00:29:56,744
Pair of kings. Kings are the winner.

438
00:30:00,815 --> 00:30:02,783
This is fun.

439
00:30:04,686 --> 00:30:08,349
-BIinds, please.
-Hey, Huck. How they falling?

440
00:30:08,523 --> 00:30:10,684
Lester. Billie Offer.

441
00:30:10,859 --> 00:30:12,121
Nice to meet you.

442
00:30:12,293 --> 00:30:15,922
Ready Eddie bet me 20 Iarge I couldn't
Iive in the AIaddin bathroom a month.

443
00:30:16,097 --> 00:30:18,691
-You gonna take him up on it?
-I'm thinking about it.

444
00:30:18,867 --> 00:30:21,563
Want a piece of my action if I do?
30 days in the bathroom.

445
00:30:21,736 --> 00:30:25,502
How hard can it be?
Maybe I can even get him to give us odds.

446
00:30:25,673 --> 00:30:27,834
I'm kind of financially handicapped
right now.

447
00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:30,510
So, Billie...

448
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:33,476
...a hundred bucks
says I can make it...

449
00:30:33,648 --> 00:30:36,116
...to the end of the room
without touching the ground.

450
00:30:37,385 --> 00:30:38,943
-Bet.
-Bet.

451
00:30:40,455 --> 00:30:41,752
Fold.

452
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:44,391
Call 40. 20 to call.

453
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:49,658
Three players.

454
00:30:51,733 --> 00:30:54,133
-Send the hundred over.
-You still owe me $1 000...

455
00:30:54,302 --> 00:30:57,135
...from miniature golf, remember?
Shovel against a rake?

456
00:30:57,305 --> 00:30:59,239
Then put it on my account.

457
00:31:01,409 --> 00:31:05,971
Did that man have breasts,
or is he physically challenged?

458
00:31:06,681 --> 00:31:09,650
Well, someone bet him 50 grand
he wouldn't get breast implants...

459
00:31:09,817 --> 00:31:11,409
...and keep them for six months.

460
00:31:11,586 --> 00:31:14,111
Guy named Zembic did it 1 2 months
a couple years ago...

461
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:18,191
...said the women went wild
for the breasts, so Lester took the bet.

462
00:31:18,359 --> 00:31:19,621
Raise. PIay for 80.

463
00:31:19,794 --> 00:31:22,388
Well, he should wear
a more flattering blouse.

464
00:31:22,564 --> 00:31:25,089
Hey, Huck. Can I get you anything?

465
00:31:26,568 --> 00:31:28,559
No thanks, Sherry.

466
00:31:30,004 --> 00:31:32,973
You must play a Iot.
You know so many people.

467
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:34,836
Well, this is what I do.

468
00:31:35,009 --> 00:31:37,671
What, Iike a job?
You don't work, you just gamble?

469
00:31:37,845 --> 00:31:40,871
Well, who said it's not work?
It's the work this city's all about.

470
00:31:41,049 --> 00:31:42,846
I'm all-in.

471
00:31:43,618 --> 00:31:46,712
Raise. AII-in. PIaying for 35.

472
00:31:47,388 --> 00:31:49,219
35 to play.

473
00:31:52,393 --> 00:31:53,917
Call.

474
00:32:00,101 --> 00:32:01,534
Why'd you turn your cards over?

475
00:32:01,703 --> 00:32:04,103
Well, he's out of chips,
so there's no more betting.

476
00:32:04,772 --> 00:32:06,239
Two players.

477
00:32:10,845 --> 00:32:12,403
Pair of queens.

478
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:15,947
Unless he gets another nine,
we've got him.

479
00:32:16,684 --> 00:32:18,618
Come on, nine.

480
00:32:18,786 --> 00:32:21,721
-Come on, nine.
-Come on, nine.

481
00:32:22,824 --> 00:32:24,257
-Yes!
-Yes!

482
00:32:24,425 --> 00:32:26,120
Three nines the winner.

483
00:32:29,931 --> 00:32:32,866
-Thank you.
-Well, you beat him once.

484
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:36,094
-It doesn't work Iike that.
-Well, maybe it should.

485
00:32:37,071 --> 00:32:40,666
L.C. Great to see you.
How you doing?

486
00:32:40,842 --> 00:32:42,639
-It's been a while.
-Yes, it has.

487
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:46,574
BIinds, please.

488
00:32:51,819 --> 00:32:53,650
-Hello, Huck.
-Hey.

489
00:32:53,821 --> 00:32:57,052
Hey. You remember Isabel.

490
00:32:57,225 --> 00:32:59,523
-Beautiful as ever.
-Thank you.

491
00:32:59,694 --> 00:33:04,290
-I hear that your Ieft pocket is empty.
-Really?

492
00:33:06,701 --> 00:33:08,692
-How you hitting them?
-Down the middle.

493
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:11,464
Yeah, we should tee it up.
It's been a Iong time.

494
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:14,507
I went and got this out of hock.

495
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:19,141
It's nice to have it back.

496
00:33:19,814 --> 00:33:21,782
I have a feeling it's gonna bring me Iuck.

497
00:33:22,684 --> 00:33:26,745
-I'm L.C.
-Hi, I'm Billie Offer. Nice to meet you.

498
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:34,220
-Thank you very much.
-Is he related to you?

499
00:33:35,196 --> 00:33:38,791
-Why do you say that?
-Because your eyes went all quiet.

500
00:33:41,302 --> 00:33:42,701
BIinds, please.

501
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:47,739
In poker, we call that a tell.
He's my father.

502
00:33:50,011 --> 00:33:53,811
Dr. Laura says, " If you Iive your Iife
angry at your parents...

503
00:33:53,981 --> 00:33:55,812
...you're only hurting yourself."

504
00:33:55,983 --> 00:33:57,883
Well, who said I was angry at anybody?

505
00:34:00,354 --> 00:34:03,221
-Raise.
-Call.

506
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:07,223
-You know what, I should get going.
-Five players.

507
00:34:07,395 --> 00:34:09,420
I don't wanna be Iate
my first night of work.

508
00:34:09,597 --> 00:34:11,997
-Anybody mind? I owe the Iady 1 000.
-Nobody cares.

509
00:34:12,533 --> 00:34:14,728
Your stake, plus a 20 percent return.

510
00:34:14,902 --> 00:34:16,529
-You don't have to.
-Fair is fair.

511
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:18,194
Do you mind cashing it in yourself?

512
00:34:18,372 --> 00:34:21,671
I've got the best of it right now.
I really shouldn't Ieave the table.

513
00:34:21,843 --> 00:34:24,573
And I'm sorry we didn't get around
to the celebrating.

514
00:34:24,746 --> 00:34:28,910
No, don't be. I haven't had
this much fun since junior high.

515
00:34:33,955 --> 00:34:35,252
Thanks, sugar.

516
00:34:37,592 --> 00:34:38,923
Raise.

517
00:34:40,695 --> 00:34:43,357
-Raise.
-Re-raise.

518
00:34:59,747 --> 00:35:02,580
-What are you watching?
-Australian games. Not bad.

519
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:04,479
Helps with March Madness withdrawal.

520
00:35:04,652 --> 00:35:06,586
-Got any money?
-I don't Ioan to gamblers.

521
00:35:07,021 --> 00:35:10,855
-I gotta get up the 1 0 for the World Series.
-Save your money. That's a sucker bet.

522
00:35:11,025 --> 00:35:12,617
Against a thousand computer geeks.

523
00:35:12,794 --> 00:35:14,785
Hey, foul! He's fouling him. That's a foul.

524
00:35:14,962 --> 00:35:17,089
How about advancing your rent?

525
00:35:17,265 --> 00:35:20,359
I'm paid up
through the NCAA Finals 2008.

526
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:22,935
-You wanna buy the house?
-You grew up in this house.

527
00:35:23,104 --> 00:35:25,937
PIus, the bank already owns it.
30 seconds.

528
00:35:26,107 --> 00:35:28,735
AII right. Just dribble out the clock.
Come on.

529
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:32,573
Okay. Pick it up. Get it back.
Get it back. Get it back.

530
00:35:35,616 --> 00:35:37,948
I'm heading back East tonight.

531
00:35:38,686 --> 00:35:42,417
Hey, you haven't seen
my digital camera, have you?

532
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:39,305
-I was so nervous.
-Didn't show.

533
00:36:40,548 --> 00:36:43,540
I didn't expect to see you so soon.

534
00:36:43,718 --> 00:36:46,653
You're not trying to rustle me, are you?

535
00:36:48,522 --> 00:36:50,888
What about that celebration?

536
00:36:51,792 --> 00:36:55,888
-It's kind of Iate, isn't it?
-This is Las Vegas.

537
00:36:56,597 --> 00:36:57,996
I don't know.

538
00:37:13,514 --> 00:37:16,881
-Can it be Chinese?
-Let's go.

539
00:37:23,925 --> 00:37:25,552
Thanks.

540
00:37:51,886 --> 00:37:54,286
-Can I get you something to drink, sir?
-Billie?

541
00:37:54,455 --> 00:37:58,585
Do you mind if I get my fortune cookie first?
I Iike to think about it during the meal.

542
00:38:00,027 --> 00:38:02,791
Could you bring her a fortune cookie
before we order?

543
00:38:03,864 --> 00:38:06,264
What about you?
Don't you wanna read your fortune?

544
00:38:06,968 --> 00:38:08,833
I can't afford to be superstitious.

545
00:38:09,603 --> 00:38:13,130
-Don't you believe in Iuck?
-I believe in skill.

546
00:38:13,307 --> 00:38:17,175
AIthough, it did seem the cards ran
a Iittle better for me when you were around.

547
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:24,142
-What happened to "the best of it"?
-Turned into a Iittle bit of the worst of it.

548
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:27,646
Maybe after dinner,
we'II go play some pok--

549
00:38:28,522 --> 00:38:32,185
Hey. Billie Offer, Chico Banh.

550
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:34,260
-My pleasure.
-Hello.

551
00:38:38,799 --> 00:38:40,926
-You get a seat yet?
-I'm working on it.

552
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:49,203
-He doesn't Iook Mexican.
-Vietnamese.

553
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:53,346
Grew up in Texas. Speaks Spanish
better than he does English.

554
00:38:53,514 --> 00:38:55,641
PIays tournament poker
better than anybody.

555
00:38:55,816 --> 00:38:57,340
Really?

556
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:05,188
What? What's it say?

557
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:08,892
" Big contest is yours to win
and riches too."

558
00:39:10,164 --> 00:39:11,722
Let me see that.

559
00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:18,530
" He who thinks too much
is thinking too much."

560
00:39:18,706 --> 00:39:21,675
Got you,
Mr. I-Can't-Afford-To-Be-Superstitious.

561
00:39:26,547 --> 00:39:28,208
Okay.

562
00:39:29,817 --> 00:39:33,184
When someone says "Ieft pocket,"
what does that mean?

563
00:39:34,588 --> 00:39:38,991
-It's where you keep your important money.
-Like the money to enter the tournament.

564
00:39:39,393 --> 00:39:43,090
And the winner of the World Series
is the best there is?

565
00:39:44,698 --> 00:39:47,963
Tournaments are for the public.
You know, the perception of who's best.

566
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:50,467
To determine who's best,
you'd play head-to-head...

567
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:52,367
...no Iimit, with your own money.

568
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:55,703
Then why do you wanna play in it?
Did your father win it?

569
00:39:58,746 --> 00:40:00,145
Twice.

570
00:40:01,415 --> 00:40:03,610
Was he always a gambler?

571
00:40:04,085 --> 00:40:06,610
He was an English professor
when he married my mother.

572
00:40:06,787 --> 00:40:11,019
She stuck by him until he Ieft her,
after he stole everything he could.

573
00:40:11,192 --> 00:40:13,217
The Ieaf doesn't fall far from the tree.

574
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:19,633
You hate him, but you still play poker.

575
00:40:22,269 --> 00:40:26,763
He taught me to play. Pennies, nickels,
and dimes on the kitchen table.

576
00:40:26,941 --> 00:40:29,876
I could never beat him
and he never Iet me win.

577
00:40:31,112 --> 00:40:33,410
Mama was a piano teacher...

578
00:40:33,581 --> 00:40:36,914
...and she taught her students
Brahms and Chopin...

579
00:40:37,084 --> 00:40:39,552
...but her real Iove was Nashville.

580
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:45,090
We used to sing together,
all around the house and in the car.

581
00:40:45,826 --> 00:40:48,454
And I always wanted to try it for real.

582
00:40:48,629 --> 00:40:51,189
So your mother must be proud of you.

583
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:54,227
She died Iast October.

584
00:40:55,736 --> 00:40:59,729
But tonight,
I almost felt Iike she was Iistening.

585
00:41:32,606 --> 00:41:34,403
You know what I think?

586
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:38,102
I think everybody's just trying
not to be Ionely.

587
00:41:47,521 --> 00:41:50,649
-You cold?
-A Iittle.

588
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:03,467
Thank you.

589
00:42:47,414 --> 00:42:52,010
-Where's all the furniture?
-I'm redecorating.

590
00:42:53,754 --> 00:42:57,281
Come on. Let me show you
what I've done with the rest of the place.

591
00:43:35,596 --> 00:43:38,997
-AII-in.
-How much you got?

592
00:43:41,969 --> 00:43:44,403
Twelve thousand two hundred.

593
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:47,170
-Coffee?
-Yes.

594
00:44:00,854 --> 00:44:03,186
You've been running over everybody
all morning.

595
00:44:03,357 --> 00:44:06,520
Don't chase what you can't catch.

596
00:44:08,696 --> 00:44:13,497
No matter what's prudent,
sometimes you gotta play your gut.

597
00:44:15,803 --> 00:44:17,634
I think I got him.

598
00:44:18,539 --> 00:44:21,633
-I think he knows it too.
-Don't Iet your ego get involved.

599
00:44:23,377 --> 00:44:26,710
If you're so sure, want a side bet?

600
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,609
-Yeah.
-The ring?

601
00:44:31,118 --> 00:44:32,346
Against 500.

602
00:44:33,887 --> 00:44:36,082
The price of poker's gone up.

603
00:44:37,624 --> 00:44:41,583
-You're on.
-Which one of you am I playing?

604
00:44:42,896 --> 00:44:44,955
Or is this a team?

605
00:44:45,132 --> 00:44:48,192
Call. Stuck on deuces.

606
00:44:49,903 --> 00:44:51,632
Deuces?

607
00:44:52,072 --> 00:44:56,566
AII you got is deuces?
And you call me with this shit?

608
00:45:09,089 --> 00:45:11,080
Deuces the winner.

609
00:45:23,303 --> 00:45:24,770
That was a great call.

610
00:45:33,547 --> 00:45:36,380
-Thanks, Robin.
-Thanks, Huck.

611
00:45:36,884 --> 00:45:38,909
-How did you do?
-Not bad.

612
00:45:39,086 --> 00:45:42,021
Where you going, Huck?
That real estate guy just walked in.

613
00:45:42,189 --> 00:45:44,089
We're starting the big game.

614
00:46:07,714 --> 00:46:11,047
-You stole from me.
-Borrowed. I-- I had it way up.

615
00:46:11,218 --> 00:46:13,914
Borrowing is when you ask!

616
00:46:15,923 --> 00:46:18,721
-You'II get it back, I promise.
-I worked hard. I needed it.

617
00:46:18,892 --> 00:46:23,352
I've got responsibilities and bills.
I'm trying to get a place on my own.

618
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:26,397
If I'd have won, you'd have a share.
Just Iike before.

619
00:46:26,567 --> 00:46:29,593
You think that the only person
that matters is you.

620
00:46:29,770 --> 00:46:31,465
What you need, when you need it!

621
00:46:32,005 --> 00:46:35,065
-You're a sick pony.
-Puppy.

622
00:46:35,242 --> 00:46:38,336
Billie? Look, it was wrong,
but I'm gonna pay you back.

623
00:46:38,512 --> 00:46:42,346
I'm not a bank! You can't make deposits
and withdrawals whenever you feel Iike it.

624
00:46:42,516 --> 00:46:44,177
-Wait. Just Iet me--
-Don't say it.

625
00:46:44,351 --> 00:46:47,809
You say whatever you think
somebody wants to hear.

626
00:46:47,988 --> 00:46:50,957
It's dangerous to be around you.

627
00:46:54,361 --> 00:46:57,023
That's why you came
to the club, isn't it?

628
00:46:57,197 --> 00:46:58,562
You knew I had the money.

629
00:46:58,732 --> 00:47:01,826
Decided why not get some put-out
at the same time?

630
00:47:02,002 --> 00:47:06,098
-It wasn't Iike that.
-Here. You missed some.

631
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:24,921
We're a couple minutes away
from the Super Satellite.

632
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:28,118
Winner gets the $ 1 0,000 seat
at the No Limit Texas Hold 'Em event.

633
00:47:28,295 --> 00:47:30,024
-Hey, Bill.
-The Super Satellite?

634
00:47:30,197 --> 00:47:33,394
-How many entries you have?
-Well, Iet' s see.

635
00:47:35,335 --> 00:47:38,736
SIug your way through 44 wannabes,
and you got your seat in the big one.

636
00:47:38,906 --> 00:47:41,204
Two and a quarter if you wanna try it.

637
00:47:41,708 --> 00:47:45,144
-I call.
-And then there were three.

638
00:47:45,312 --> 00:47:48,008
Mr. Ray Zumbro, Mr. Huck Cheever...

639
00:47:48,181 --> 00:47:52,311
...and the current chip Ieader,
Ms. Shannon Kincaid.

640
00:47:52,486 --> 00:47:56,752
Cheever? L.C. Cheever's son?
And you play cards?

641
00:47:56,924 --> 00:47:59,119
That takes balls.

642
00:48:03,730 --> 00:48:05,391
Heads up.

643
00:49:14,601 --> 00:49:16,262
I'm all-in.

644
00:49:22,576 --> 00:49:23,907
Call.

645
00:49:28,148 --> 00:49:30,639
Two pair. Kings and deuces.

646
00:49:31,685 --> 00:49:33,983
Kings and eights the winner.

647
00:49:43,964 --> 00:49:45,761
She did play well.

648
00:49:50,370 --> 00:49:53,339
Must be tough
playing in the shadow of your father.

649
00:49:54,808 --> 00:49:57,641
Little coffeehousing for distraction?

650
00:49:57,911 --> 00:50:00,880
No, you wouldn't be bothered
by anything Iike that. I mean...

651
00:50:01,048 --> 00:50:05,246
...you wouldn't have gotten this far
if you couldn't stand on your own two feet.

652
00:50:14,928 --> 00:50:16,691
I'm all-in.

653
00:50:23,236 --> 00:50:25,898
You're not trying
to steal the blinds, are you?

654
00:50:31,411 --> 00:50:33,470
How much does he have?

655
00:50:38,351 --> 00:50:41,343
Jesus, old man,
when you gonna Iearn to count, huh?

656
00:50:43,690 --> 00:50:46,750
It's 20 a stack. See? 20 a stack.

657
00:50:49,696 --> 00:50:52,062
Fifty-one hundred, sir.

658
00:50:53,967 --> 00:50:55,491
Call.

659
00:50:58,638 --> 00:51:00,731
Pair of eights.

660
00:51:02,609 --> 00:51:04,577
Tens to eights.

661
00:51:13,587 --> 00:51:14,918
Tens to eights still stand.

662
00:51:21,762 --> 00:51:24,424
Pair of tens are still tall. Last card--

663
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:31,833
The tens stand up. Mr. Cheever wins
a seat in the World Series.

664
00:51:34,474 --> 00:51:37,204
Sorry I won't be seeing you
at the big dance.

665
00:51:41,548 --> 00:51:44,016
Hey, wait a minute,
there's only two burn cards.

666
00:51:44,184 --> 00:51:45,481
What?

667
00:51:50,157 --> 00:51:53,058
Mr. Cheever. Mr. Cheever.

668
00:51:57,397 --> 00:52:02,528
-I'm afraid we've had a misdeal.
-What do you mean you've had a misdeal?

669
00:52:02,702 --> 00:52:06,968
No card was burned, the dealer neglected
to burn a card before the river.

670
00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:09,472
That's not my problem.
A card Iaid's a card played.

671
00:52:09,643 --> 00:52:13,909
I'm sorry, but house rules require a card
to be burned before any cards are turned.

672
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:17,982
And in the event of this situation the card
is put back, it's used as a burn card...

673
00:52:18,151 --> 00:52:20,449
...and then a new river is dealt.

674
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:29,319
Take back the six.

675
00:52:31,798 --> 00:52:33,197
Burn it.

676
00:52:36,269 --> 00:52:37,759
Deal the river.

677
00:52:43,777 --> 00:52:48,840
-Yeah! Yeah, baby!
-A set. Three eights the winner.

678
00:52:49,749 --> 00:52:53,583
Guess you won't be needing
to press your dress quite yet, Cinderella.

679
00:53:01,361 --> 00:53:05,957
I heard about the misdeal.
Boy, talk about a bad beat, huh?

680
00:53:06,132 --> 00:53:10,034
Okay, so you put up the 1 0,
we split anything I win fifty-fifty.

681
00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:13,170
-Seventy-thirty.
-What happened to sixty-forty?

682
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:16,503
Went away when your tens
went down to a set of eights.

683
00:53:17,510 --> 00:53:19,375
Okay. Sixty-five-thirty-five.

684
00:53:23,250 --> 00:53:24,717
Fine, seventy-thirty.

685
00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:35,259
I need an extra 1 200.

686
00:53:37,530 --> 00:53:39,760
It's that or no deal.

687
00:54:06,693 --> 00:54:11,357
-You took the bet.
-It's Iike stealing money.

688
00:54:11,531 --> 00:54:15,524
Look at him. Checking up on me.
He's still hoping I'm gonna sneak out.

689
00:54:15,802 --> 00:54:17,861
He's having a party now,
three days into it.

690
00:54:18,038 --> 00:54:21,599
In a week, you'II be begging to get
out of here. You play any golf Iately?

691
00:54:22,042 --> 00:54:23,441
-A Iittle.
-"A Iittle."

692
00:54:23,610 --> 00:54:26,909
-Four handicap and he says "a Iittle."
-Six from the black tees.

693
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:31,574
I'II tell you what. I'II bet you 5000
that you can't run five miles...

694
00:54:31,751 --> 00:54:35,152
...shoot 1 8 holes of golf, 78 or under,
in three hours or Iess.

695
00:54:36,323 --> 00:54:37,551
-Forget it.
-Room service.

696
00:54:37,724 --> 00:54:40,318
Oh, yeah. Put it right here, boss.

697
00:54:40,493 --> 00:54:44,429
Paulie's right outside that door, just in case
you're thinking of trying anything.

698
00:54:44,597 --> 00:54:46,792
Think about that bet, Huck.

699
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:48,733
Comfort food.

700
00:55:51,564 --> 00:55:54,158
-Hi.
-Hi.

701
00:55:59,472 --> 00:56:01,531
I'm truly sorry, Billie.

702
00:56:08,548 --> 00:56:10,675
I want you to give me another chance.

703
00:56:13,686 --> 00:56:15,449
Why should I?

704
00:56:17,957 --> 00:56:21,484
You know what you said before
about everybody trying not to be Ionely?

705
00:56:21,661 --> 00:56:24,824
I feel Iike we have a chance
at something special here.

706
00:56:24,998 --> 00:56:29,435
And if you cut it off now,
we'II never know.

707
00:56:35,075 --> 00:56:38,442
Why don't you just come have breakfast
with me, see how it goes?

708
00:56:49,022 --> 00:56:50,319
Thanks.

709
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:53,118
-Don't you ever sleep?
-I don't need much sleep.

710
00:56:53,293 --> 00:56:55,352
So you play poker instead.

711
00:56:57,931 --> 00:57:01,833
Why do you Iike it so much?
Is it the money?

712
00:57:02,001 --> 00:57:04,469
The money's just a way of keeping score.

713
00:57:05,572 --> 00:57:09,167
Poker is competition in the purest sense.

714
00:57:09,609 --> 00:57:13,067
Doesn't matter who you are,
or what you are...

715
00:57:13,246 --> 00:57:15,043
...everybody's equal at the table.

716
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:18,977
But you can't have sympathy and win.

717
00:57:19,319 --> 00:57:21,810
In order for you to win,
someone else has to Iose.

718
00:57:22,655 --> 00:57:25,123
It seems so cruel.

719
00:57:25,925 --> 00:57:27,916
So you just gamble all the time?

720
00:57:29,095 --> 00:57:31,962
I never bet on sports,
never play against the house...

721
00:57:32,132 --> 00:57:35,898
...and I only bet on my skills
against the skills of other people.

722
00:57:37,103 --> 00:57:41,301
That sounds Iike an alcoholic saying,
"I only drink tequila."

723
00:57:42,075 --> 00:57:44,509
What about Festus,
or whatever his name is...

724
00:57:44,677 --> 00:57:46,975
...jumping across the floor?
You bet on that.

725
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:49,680
The chair thing's an old gag,
and I did it for you...

726
00:57:49,849 --> 00:57:52,044
...because I thought
you'd think it was funny.

727
00:57:59,359 --> 00:58:01,259
-Miss Offer.
-Mr. Cheever.

728
00:58:01,427 --> 00:58:03,418
I thought you might be here.
