1
00:03:11,457 --> 00:03:13,948
Carlos!

2
00:03:14,093 --> 00:03:16,152
Carlos!

3
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:19,431
Carlos!

4
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,541
Yo, yo, what's up? Today, like every day,

5
00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:41,553
we're gonna be showing you
the dopest cribs in the world.

6
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:43,646
Check it out.

7
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:56,134
Hey.

8
00:03:57,337 --> 00:03:58,429
'Sup?

9
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:02,507
I'm tired. Go to bed.

10
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,575
Come on. Go to bed.

11
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:11,674
All right, man. I'm leavin'.

12
00:05:15,581 --> 00:05:17,344
Luis.

13
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:19,675
Wake up!

14
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:42,898
Apá, I need some money.

15
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:44,840
Again? Why?

16
00:05:45,878 --> 00:05:48,403
I need to buy some stuff for school.

17
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:51,380
Since when do you go to school?

18
00:05:51,884 --> 00:05:53,442
Every day.

19
00:05:54,987 --> 00:05:56,147
Right.

20
00:05:57,757 --> 00:06:00,089
How many days have you missed this year?

21
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:02,992
I don't know, 18, 19.

22
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:09,666
I don't want you to miss school no more.
School's important.

23
00:06:09,936 --> 00:06:11,233
It's everything.

24
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:12,293
Sí, Professor?

25
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:14,696
Sí, Professor.

26
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:16,667
You wanna end up like me?

27
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,168
No.

28
00:06:19,812 --> 00:06:22,372
Hey, so can I have the money or what?

29
00:06:22,982 --> 00:06:25,280
You want money? Come work.

30
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:27,914
You used to come with me on Saturdays.

31
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,246
Well, I had to stop 'cause of soccer.

32
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:32,018
You haven't played football in years.

33
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:35,057
Well, that's because
that league sucked, man.

34
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:38,723
If you need money in this world, Luis,
necesitas trabajar.

35
00:06:39,532 --> 00:06:41,363
You need to work.

36
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:43,866
Get yourself an education.

37
00:06:43,936 --> 00:06:48,066
You know what? I'm gonna jack an old lady
in the street, all right? I don't care.

38
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:54,110
That's not funny.

39
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,943
Don't even say that.

40
00:06:56,816 --> 00:06:58,943
You better go to school now.

41
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:01,646
Damn!

42
00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:08,091
Listen, buddy.

43
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:10,929
You ain't just buyin' a truck, or a business.

44
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:13,689
What you're buyin' is the American Dream.

45
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,900
I ain't buyin' your truck.

46
00:07:16,135 --> 00:07:21,732
Fine. If you don't buy her,
someone else will.

47
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:27,077
And if I sell her to someone else,
then you're out of a job.

48
00:07:27,513 --> 00:07:30,277
Back on that corner
where I found you six years ago.

49
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,583
Beggin' for work with all the other
desperate wetbacks.

50
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:37,719
Duckin' La Migra. Not knowing
where your next dollar's gonna come.

51
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:42,788
But you buy ol' girl from me,
you keep my tools...

52
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,256
You keep all my customers...

53
00:07:45,498 --> 00:07:47,625
...You'll be your own boss.

54
00:07:49,435 --> 00:07:50,732
Look at me.

55
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:55,701
I came here with nothing, but I'm
going home to my very own farm.

56
00:07:56,742 --> 00:07:58,869
I don't want to go home.

57
00:08:10,022 --> 00:08:11,853
Please tell him to be careful.

58
00:08:11,924 --> 00:08:12,913
Don't worry, Mrs. Donnely.

59
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:16,656
He does this all the time.
He's a professional.

60
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:19,865
Shouldn't you be using one of those
cherry-picker things?

61
00:08:19,932 --> 00:08:20,921
A cherry picker?

62
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:24,236
If I had a cherry picker,
I'd have to charge more.

63
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:28,071
Are you insured?

64
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:33,375
Mrs. Donnely,
I'm fully insured and bonded. I promise you.

65
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:36,712
This is the way we do it in Mexico.

66
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:38,380
It's safe. Believe me.

67
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:44,012
If it's so safe,
why don't you climb up here, fatty?

68
00:08:53,966 --> 00:08:58,266
What about you? How much you got?

69
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,401
You believe that? That fool's locochón.

70
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,343
I'm gonna hurt that boy.

71
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:06,772
Man, what's his name?

72
00:09:07,613 --> 00:09:09,877
I don't know. Ramon or somethin'.

73
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:11,041
Who he down with?

74
00:09:11,117 --> 00:09:12,584
I don't care who he with.

75
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:13,641
Hey!

76
00:09:14,921 --> 00:09:16,081
Hey, what's up?

77
00:09:16,155 --> 00:09:17,747
What's up?

78
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:19,154
What's up?

79
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:22,986
Facu just got taxed
by that big kid over there.

80
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:25,158
For real?

81
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:27,631
I heard Ramon had some yesca.

82
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:30,800
So I went over to him,
confirmed what was what,

83
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:31,962
and then I gave him the bolas.

84
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:33,432
No, he gave him my bolas.

85
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:36,669
And when I asked him for the yesca,
he just told me to step off.

86
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:38,073
And you let him get away with that shit?

87
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:39,372
Hell, no. I wasn't with this fool.

88
00:09:39,445 --> 00:09:43,279
Yo, Ruthie, what was I gonna do?
Cancel that fool with the judas right there?

89
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:46,317
You can't let these bitches take an inch
or they'll take a mile.

90
00:09:46,385 --> 00:09:48,080
Come on.

91
00:09:56,696 --> 00:09:58,391
Yo, my man, you know who I am?

92
00:09:59,398 --> 00:10:01,263
No. But I want to.

93
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:05,303
I'm gonna have you killed. That's who I am.

94
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:07,538
Why you wanna kill me for, mija?

95
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:09,635
Oh, you ain't believe me?

96
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:13,076
Ask anybody who my uncles are.
I'm gonna have you killed.

97
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:18,539
What's up then?

98
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:19,707
You took my man's money?

99
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:22,049
No, I told him I'd hook him up later
when the guards weren't lookin'.

100
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:23,110
Lyin' bitch! You didn't say that.

101
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:25,919
I said to hang back till after lunch
until we went inside.

102
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:30,323
So, what's up? You want that shit or not?

103
00:10:31,097 --> 00:10:33,156
- No.
- Just give him back his money.

104
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:37,901
All right.

105
00:10:44,176 --> 00:10:45,700
It was nice doin' business with you.

106
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,740
So, what's your real name, anyway, mija?

107
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:50,413
Hey, what?

108
00:11:04,196 --> 00:11:06,494
Hey, hey, stop!

109
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:11,869
Didn't do nothing! I didn't do anything!

110
00:11:11,937 --> 00:11:13,370
No?

111
00:11:28,788 --> 00:11:34,385
It's a pig farm, but we're also selling
sandwiches, drinks...

112
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:37,858
...Electronics, the whole deal.

113
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,465
We're delivering packages.

114
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:43,461
To who? We're all here.

115
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:48,263
What is it? The money?

116
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:52,033
Blasco...

117
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:56,710
...I wish more than anything
I could buy your truck.

118
00:11:57,149 --> 00:11:58,138
Then do it!

119
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,649
I can't do it.

120
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:03,147
Remember that lawyer
who took all my money?

121
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,554
He said he'd get me my papers.

122
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:07,586
No papers, no driver's license.

123
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:10,658
What if the cops stop me
for a broken tail light?

124
00:12:11,163 --> 00:12:13,893
You know what'll happen.
They'll send me back.

125
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,133
And then what'll happen to Luis?

126
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:22,203
Think about what happens
if you don't buy the truck.

127
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:25,609
What happens if the Migra gets you
and you're not makin' money?

128
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:28,711
They don't care about separatin'
parents from their kids.

129
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:31,278
Since 9l11 things aren't the same.

130
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:35,486
It's not
a little drive through Juarez anymore.

131
00:12:36,021 --> 00:12:37,989
It's three days in the desert.

132
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:43,159
My cousin Ernesto?
They never found his body.

133
00:12:43,996 --> 00:12:46,055
What happens if you stay in
that same neighborhood?

134
00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:52,197
Sendin' Luisito to that same school,
with those same low-lifes.

135
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:55,036
You wanna get your papers?

136
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:57,500
You wanna be legal?

137
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:00,140
Buy the truck, carnal.

138
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:04,507
...In a few months, you'll have
enough money to hire a real killer lawyer.

139
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:12,849
You know...

140
00:13:14,226 --> 00:13:20,790
...When you leave,
I'm just gonna find another job.

141
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,795
I'll stay quiet...

142
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:29,341
...Keep my head down...

143
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:34,078
...And try to stay invisible.

144
00:13:39,618 --> 00:13:41,313
Let's go back to work.

145
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:46,758
Why'd you hit the kid?

146
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:49,727
I don't know, man.
It's not that big of a deal.

147
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:52,525
Kids are getting down every day
in my school a lot worse than this.

148
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,567
You honestly expect me to believe
this wasn't some kind of gang beef?

149
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,800
You can believe
whatever you wanna believe.

150
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:04,698
Take your shirt off.

151
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,207
What?

152
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:08,974
Take your shirt off.
I need to get pictures of your tattoos.

153
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:11,243
Yo, man, I ain't in a gang.

154
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:13,279
Come on. Indulge me.

155
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:15,353
Man, why you gotta make every Chicano kid
out here...

156
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:18,083
Hey, kid, just take your shirt off.

157
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:31,067
What did I say?

158
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:35,931
Okay, tough guy.

159
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:38,602
Who do you want us to contact at home
about this?

160
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:41,475
- Your mom?
- I ain't got no mom.

161
00:14:41,747 --> 00:14:42,736
What about your father?

162
00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:45,409
You can't reach him.

163
00:14:46,518 --> 00:14:47,542
Why not?

164
00:14:49,021 --> 00:14:50,488
He's workin'.

165
00:16:23,248 --> 00:16:24,340
See you tomorrow.

166
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:28,010
No, compadre. Tomorrow we don't work.

167
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:32,420
I'm gonna see who'll give me
the best price for my truck.

168
00:16:36,061 --> 00:16:38,825
Sure. I understand.

169
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:40,754
Twelve thousand. That's a lot of money.

170
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:44,689
I can barely afford to put gas in the car.

171
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:51,763
I'd be able to pay you back in a year.

172
00:17:52,337 --> 00:17:53,326
Maybe sooner.

173
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:56,639
Sorry, I know you just got back from work.

174
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:57,936
Who are you talking to?

175
00:17:58,010 --> 00:17:59,068
Your uncle.

176
00:18:01,213 --> 00:18:02,771
Look, I just got home.

177
00:18:03,215 --> 00:18:07,049
Humberto already left for work.
I'll ask him about it tonight.

178
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:10,653
But don't get your hopes up.
You know what he's like.

179
00:18:10,956 --> 00:18:12,150
I know.

180
00:18:13,325 --> 00:18:15,452
He's the cheapest man
on the face of this earth.

181
00:18:15,894 --> 00:18:18,863
Don't worry. I'll figure something out.

182
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:22,293
God, I really wish I could help you.

183
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:24,035
Tell Luis I send him a hug.

184
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,167
And to behave.

185
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:27,997
Yeah, all right.

186
00:18:28,073 --> 00:18:29,199
Bye.

187
00:18:42,354 --> 00:18:43,912
Hey.

188
00:18:44,423 --> 00:18:46,448
Who was that you were talkin' to?

189
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:48,220
Your tía, Anita.

190
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:50,691
What's she want?

191
00:18:50,762 --> 00:18:52,787
She wants you to behave.

192
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:54,992
She can't tell me that herself?

193
00:18:55,834 --> 00:18:57,301
Come on, wake up.

194
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,536
I'm not going in today.

195
00:19:00,005 --> 00:19:01,404
Why? You sick?

196
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:03,771
- No, I got suspended.
- What?

197
00:19:04,776 --> 00:19:07,210
I got suspended.

198
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:10,975
Why?

199
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:13,176
I don't know, man. Some bullshit.
Don't worry about it.

200
00:19:14,253 --> 00:19:15,914
Come on, man. Let me go to sleep.

201
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:18,114
I don't want you to leave this house today.

202
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:22,019
- Luis?
- What?

203
00:19:22,194 --> 00:19:24,754
Did you understand?

204
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:27,162
Yeah, I got you, man.

205
00:19:27,232 --> 00:19:29,257
Go mow some lawns.

206
00:19:33,138 --> 00:19:37,234
I don't want you going outside. Not a step.

207
00:19:38,043 --> 00:19:40,034
You better not.

208
00:20:42,841 --> 00:20:44,672
How many people?

209
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:49,547
How many people? How many? How many?

210
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:50,639
Two.

211
00:20:50,716 --> 00:20:53,082
I need two. Two only.

212
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:43,991
So, I'm gonna catch up with them
pretty soon. Hopefully...

213
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:48,305
Man, why your girl
gotta handle our business yesterday?

214
00:21:48,373 --> 00:21:50,204
She made us look like a couple of bitches.

215
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:51,708
She made you look like a bitch.

216
00:21:51,777 --> 00:21:53,244
I was beatin' that boy's ass.

217
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:54,607
You was just tap dancing on him

218
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:57,374
like America's Got Talent or some shit.

219
00:21:57,449 --> 00:22:00,885
All's I know is your haina gets more respect
than you.

220
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:02,886
Even the cops know not to mess with her.

221
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:04,721
They know we ain't nothin'.

222
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:07,448
Speak for yourself, fool.

223
00:22:07,626 --> 00:22:10,288
Yeah? What's so special about you, fool?

224
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:11,727
You ain't no gangster.

225
00:22:11,797 --> 00:22:14,425
All you gonna do is mow lawns
like your pops.

226
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:15,693
Hell, no.

227
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:18,065
Then what? Bus tables at Denny's?

228
00:22:18,136 --> 00:22:20,502
Park cars in one of them little red vests?

229
00:22:21,773 --> 00:22:22,762
All right.

230
00:22:23,575 --> 00:22:26,408
If I make this right now,
it's all gonna work out for me.

231
00:22:26,611 --> 00:22:27,669
I'm gonna be rich.

232
00:22:28,447 --> 00:22:30,312
I'm gonna have
a big ol' mansion in Beverly Hills.

233
00:22:30,582 --> 00:22:32,812
And you're gonna mow my lawn, bitch.

234
00:22:33,819 --> 00:22:34,911
All right.

235
00:22:34,986 --> 00:22:36,283
But if you miss,

236
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:39,222
then you're gonna end up killed out here
in these streets.

237
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:40,383
Biatch!

238
00:22:40,459 --> 00:22:41,448
It ain't funny.

239
00:22:41,727 --> 00:22:43,160
I ain't jokin'.

240
00:22:43,228 --> 00:22:44,957
What's up, youngsters?

241
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:48,332
You bein' good to my cousin Ruthie?

242
00:22:49,334 --> 00:22:50,358
Yeah, you know it.

243
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:52,759
What up, 'Celo?

244
00:22:53,772 --> 00:22:56,468
Nothin', man. Just putting in work.
You know how we do.

245
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:57,530
No doubt.

246
00:22:57,609 --> 00:22:59,270
What you doin' out of school?

247
00:22:59,344 --> 00:23:00,675
Suspended.

248
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:05,615
That's all they know how to do.
Lock us out or lock us up.

249
00:23:05,684 --> 00:23:08,278
Watch out.
You know what they used to do with us?

250
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:10,548
Put on a video and leave the room.

251
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:14,557
Yeah. That's what they do to us, too.
It's just they got DVDs now.

252
00:23:16,194 --> 00:23:20,597
So I decided, "Screw it,
I'm getting into the hood."

253
00:23:20,665 --> 00:23:22,360
Hey, 'Celo.

254
00:23:22,467 --> 00:23:24,128
What if I'm ready?

255
00:23:24,669 --> 00:23:27,297
For what, Lil' Aztec All-Star?

256
00:23:27,372 --> 00:23:28,703
To get jumped into the barrio.

257
00:23:29,374 --> 00:23:30,773
Roll with y'all.

258
00:23:31,276 --> 00:23:32,470
Fuck it.

259
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:35,940
Nah. You don't wanna do that, homie.

260
00:23:36,014 --> 00:23:38,346
End up shot, or in the pinta.

261
00:23:39,718 --> 00:23:42,346
I don't know. Try me next week.

262
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,349
Hey, what's happenin', bro?

263
00:23:51,663 --> 00:23:53,028
What?

264
00:24:11,683 --> 00:24:12,707
What are you doin' here?

265
00:24:13,051 --> 00:24:14,416
It'd be better to talk inside.

266
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:28,496
Luis, get up. Your aunt's here.

267
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:33,532
Hola, Luis.

268
00:24:33,672 --> 00:24:34,969
So what? What's up?
You come to check on me?

269
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:37,832
See if I'm behaving?

270
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:39,137
I came to see your father.

271
00:24:39,211 --> 00:24:40,644
You want something to drink, flaca?

272
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:45,943
Water.
But I can't stay long or they'll dock my pay.

273
00:24:47,219 --> 00:24:48,743
Can you give us a moment?

274
00:25:00,966 --> 00:25:02,365
What's goin' on?

275
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:16,109
Humberto said yes?

276
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:19,210
- I didn't ask him.
- You didn't ask him?

277
00:25:19,417 --> 00:25:22,614
He would have said no.

278
00:25:23,455 --> 00:25:25,252
Where did you get the money?

279
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:31,993
Since Linda was born, we've saved some
money every month from his check...

280
00:25:32,297 --> 00:25:35,289
...So if one of us is sick, or gets laid off...

281
00:25:35,667 --> 00:25:38,534
...We'd have money for whatever happened.

282
00:25:39,504 --> 00:25:43,770
The account is in my name.
He never reads the statements.

283
00:25:58,156 --> 00:25:59,589
I can't, I'm sorry.

284
00:25:59,824 --> 00:26:01,314
Yes, you can.

285
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:03,591
- If something happens...
- It won't.

286
00:26:03,795 --> 00:26:04,887
But you don't understand.

287
00:26:05,297 --> 00:26:07,857
If I get in an accident, or arrested,
or anything...

288
00:26:07,933 --> 00:26:09,093
Carlos.

289
00:26:09,167 --> 00:26:11,260
I understand everything.

290
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:17,007
Buy the truck.

291
00:26:17,642 --> 00:26:20,236
And if you do well, like you say...

292
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:23,441
...Everything's gonna change.

293
00:26:23,715 --> 00:26:27,617
That's why we came here, right?

294
00:26:30,221 --> 00:26:32,189
Right.

295
00:26:37,228 --> 00:26:39,253
I've gotta get to work.

296
00:26:55,413 --> 00:26:57,176
Take care.

297
00:27:03,722 --> 00:27:04,950
What's goin' on?

298
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:40,776
All students, the bell has rung.

299
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:44,044
You need to leave the campus
in an orderly fashion.

300
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:46,547
I need you to stay in your lines.

301
00:28:53,098 --> 00:28:54,087
Oh, God.

302
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:57,223
Who's that?

303
00:28:57,335 --> 00:28:59,326
Wait a minute. Hold up.

304
00:29:06,544 --> 00:29:07,602
Hey.

305
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:09,637
What are you doing here?

306
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:14,017
I just wanted to come by
and see you at school.

307
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:15,943
Pretty nice, huh?

308
00:29:16,821 --> 00:29:17,810
Here.

309
00:29:18,389 --> 00:29:19,788
What's this?

310
00:29:20,291 --> 00:29:21,815
It's a present.

311
00:29:22,393 --> 00:29:23,553
For what?

312
00:29:23,628 --> 00:29:25,596
Just take a look at it.

313
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:34,228
I don't understand.

314
00:29:34,305 --> 00:29:35,636
That's your team, right?

315
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:38,265
Yeah, I guess.

316
00:29:42,914 --> 00:29:46,873
- So, what do you think?
- Blasco's truck?

317
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:49,048
Yeah, it's all right. Seen it before.

318
00:29:50,421 --> 00:29:52,753
It's not Blasco's truck anymore.

319
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:55,592
It's ours.

320
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:59,453
Good for you, apá.

321
00:29:59,531 --> 00:30:01,226
No, mijo.

322
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:03,199
Good for us.

323
00:30:06,171 --> 00:30:07,536
Sure.

324
00:30:07,605 --> 00:30:09,095
Good for us.

325
00:30:10,742 --> 00:30:12,903
Get in. I'll give you a ride home.

326
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:15,207
No, man. I gotta go with this girl.

327
00:30:16,247 --> 00:30:18,044
You guys gonna study?

328
00:30:18,416 --> 00:30:20,407
Yeah. Somethin' like that.

329
00:30:23,454 --> 00:30:25,217
Hey, apá?

330
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:27,315
You gonna let me drive this bad boy
when I'm 16?

331
00:30:28,193 --> 00:30:29,182
Sure.

332
00:30:29,561 --> 00:30:31,461
- For real?
- Yeah, yeah.

333
00:30:32,297 --> 00:30:33,730
If you get your license.

334
00:30:33,798 --> 00:30:35,766
You ain't got a license!

335
00:30:36,201 --> 00:30:38,533
Don't say that too loud, okay?

336
00:30:39,737 --> 00:30:41,637
See you later.

337
00:30:45,577 --> 00:30:47,568
Come on. Keep it moving.

338
00:30:56,120 --> 00:31:02,355
I can't live, I can't go on
knowing that I, I, I, I

339
00:31:02,594 --> 00:31:05,188
I let you get away

340
00:31:05,496 --> 00:31:08,659
All this time I should have known
I should have seen it

341
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:11,960
To get off the ground
And now you're slipping through my fingers

342
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:14,402
All because you never knew

343
00:31:14,472 --> 00:31:18,932
That I was falling for ya
Falling for you

344
00:31:23,348 --> 00:31:25,543
Yeah! That was great, nene.

345
00:31:27,452 --> 00:31:29,613
- Yeah.
- That was incredible.

346
00:31:29,687 --> 00:31:30,676
Thank you.

347
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:33,216
- Hey. I gotta be out.
- Okay.

348
00:31:33,524 --> 00:31:35,424
Luis, you sure you don't wanna take
some of this with you?

349
00:31:35,493 --> 00:31:36,482
No, gracias.

350
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:38,927
- Okay, baby. It was nice seein' you again.
- Yeah.

351
00:31:41,633 --> 00:31:42,725
You out, son?

352
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:45,860
- Yeah, I gotta bounce.
- All right, Luis. Be easy.

353
00:31:46,204 --> 00:31:49,571
Come through tomorrow, though.
Gotta talk about your future.

354
00:31:50,975 --> 00:31:51,964
Yeah, all right.

355
00:31:52,944 --> 00:31:54,434
All right, kid. Peace.

356
00:31:54,846 --> 00:31:56,006
Peace.

357
00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:07,290
- Okay. Get home safe.
- All right.

358
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:55,123
What time is it?

359
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,165
I don't know. Like, 12:00?

360
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,029
Where were you?

361
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:05,467
I told you. I was at that girl's house.

362
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:07,705
I ate dinner there.

363
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:13,876
Listen, mijo.

364
00:34:19,624 --> 00:34:22,855
I'm gonna make somethin'
out of this business.

365
00:34:22,927 --> 00:34:25,327
I'll make it grow into somethin' big.

366
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:32,096
So we could move out of here

367
00:34:32,703 --> 00:34:34,933
and get you in a better school.

368
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:41,773
And I'm not gonna work Sundays no more.

369
00:34:44,348 --> 00:34:47,977
We can do things, spend time together.

370
00:34:50,388 --> 00:34:54,688
If you want, you know?

371
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,494
I'm really tired, apá.
I'm just gonna go to bed.

372
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:08,295
Yeah.

373
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:11,272
Sure, mijo. Yeah, go to sleep.

374
00:35:53,251 --> 00:35:56,778
Sorry, I only need one.

375
00:36:03,528 --> 00:36:06,053
- What's your name?
- Santiago.

376
00:36:06,297 --> 00:36:08,765
Carlos. My pleasure.

377
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:12,102
Ready?

378
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:50,937
You're going to climb that?

379
00:36:51,809 --> 00:36:53,640
Sure.

380
00:36:54,011 --> 00:36:55,444
You're crazy.

381
00:36:57,949 --> 00:36:59,143
Piece of cake.

382
00:38:14,725 --> 00:38:16,886
It's a beautiful view.

383
00:38:20,898 --> 00:38:22,729
Give me the saw, will you?

384
00:39:50,354 --> 00:39:52,447
Stop! Please! Help!

385
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:54,710
What are you doing out here, man?

386
00:40:58,589 --> 00:40:59,578
What happened? Did you get in a fight?

387
00:41:00,658 --> 00:41:02,285
Are you drunk?

388
00:41:02,426 --> 00:41:03,415
Took it.

389
00:41:04,195 --> 00:41:05,992
Where are your tools?

390
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:07,889
They stole it.

391
00:41:07,998 --> 00:41:09,226
They stole the tools?

392
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:12,436
- The truck.
- They jacked the truck?

393
00:41:13,103 --> 00:41:14,502
Papá, what happened?

394
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:16,503
The truck, they took it.

395
00:41:17,541 --> 00:41:18,599
Who stole the truck?

396
00:41:18,776 --> 00:41:20,334
I gotta find him. I gotta find him.

397
00:41:20,411 --> 00:41:23,812
- Papá, you calm down.
- Gotta find him. Gotta find him.

398
00:41:24,615 --> 00:41:25,741
I have to find the truck!

399
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:29,344
If I don't get it back, I'm just...

400
00:41:31,689 --> 00:41:33,281
Are you gonna be okay?

401
00:42:48,499 --> 00:42:51,161
Papá, wait. Here. Take this.

402
00:42:53,771 --> 00:42:55,796
I made you some breakfast.

403
00:42:59,443 --> 00:43:02,503
No, I don't have time.
I gotta find the guy who stole the truck.

404
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:05,046
- That's my only chance.
- Okay, I'm comin' with you.

405
00:43:05,115 --> 00:43:06,912
No, Luis, this is my problem...

406
00:43:06,984 --> 00:43:08,815
No, this is our problem.

407
00:43:11,722 --> 00:43:14,282
Just go to school. Please.

408
00:43:14,358 --> 00:43:16,792
Man, I'm not going in today.

409
00:43:17,194 --> 00:43:18,821
Don't tell me you got suspended again.

410
00:43:20,564 --> 00:43:21,588
Nah, man.

411
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:23,858
It's Saturday.

412
00:43:25,569 --> 00:43:26,797
Okay.

413
00:43:27,304 --> 00:43:28,931
Okay, let's go.

414
00:43:36,513 --> 00:43:40,005
Look at these pendejos out here
hoin' themselves.

415
00:43:40,084 --> 00:43:41,745
You think they want to do this?

416
00:43:41,819 --> 00:43:42,911
Nah, but...

417
00:43:42,987 --> 00:43:47,048
That was me out there!
That's gonna be me out there.

418
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:49,786
Yeah. Well, it's also the bitch
that stole your truck.

419
00:43:52,696 --> 00:43:54,220
Just wait here.

420
00:44:28,399 --> 00:44:31,334
Okay. This is Jesus. He says he knows him.

421
00:44:31,435 --> 00:44:34,336
He'll show us where Santiago lives for $50.

422
00:44:34,605 --> 00:44:36,334
- Sure he will.
- Eh?

423
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:39,265
He can't work if he takes us, right?

424
00:44:40,177 --> 00:44:41,405
Tell him to give us the address.

425
00:44:41,478 --> 00:44:44,003
He doesn't know the address.
He only knows how to get there.

426
00:44:44,081 --> 00:44:45,070
Where?

427
00:44:47,117 --> 00:44:49,551
He lives in South Central.

428
00:44:49,953 --> 00:44:52,387
Great. That's Crip-land.

429
00:44:53,924 --> 00:44:57,257
Gangs, Papá. We're goin' to Crip-land
to find a Salvatrucha.

430
00:45:15,779 --> 00:45:17,644
Hey, hold up. What up?

431
00:45:18,682 --> 00:45:20,240
Come on over here.

432
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:24,650
Hey, what's up? What up?
What's up with y'all?

433
00:45:34,798 --> 00:45:38,063
Long way from Boyle Heights.

434
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:43,164
Hey, where's this fool takin' us?

435
00:45:44,341 --> 00:45:45,501
Is it far?

436
00:45:47,911 --> 00:45:49,674
Yeah. Well, tell homie
if he's lyin', he's dyin'.

437
00:45:55,953 --> 00:45:57,511
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

438
00:45:57,588 --> 00:45:58,987
Yeah, but in which one?

439
00:45:59,289 --> 00:46:01,814
I don't know, I'm sorry.

440
00:46:02,326 --> 00:46:05,955
Excuse me, sir. We're looking for a friend.

441
00:46:11,668 --> 00:46:13,226
We're gonna have to go door to door.

442
00:46:13,303 --> 00:46:15,567
No, no, hold on.
You say he took your phone, right?

443
00:46:17,407 --> 00:46:18,396
Yeah.

444
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:21,767
Yeah, yeah.

445
00:47:04,788 --> 00:47:06,847
Yeah, this is it.

446
00:47:21,371 --> 00:47:22,531
Santiago?

447
00:47:22,973 --> 00:47:24,167
Santiago? Wake up.

448
00:47:25,042 --> 00:47:26,373
Nah, man. If he's here, he's here.

449
00:47:26,443 --> 00:47:27,501
What's going on?

450
00:47:27,578 --> 00:47:28,602
Where's Santiago?

451
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:29,771
Who are you?

452
00:47:30,914 --> 00:47:32,973
I'm sorry Miss. We're looking for a friend.
It's urgent.

453
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:35,644
What's this guy called?

454
00:47:35,953 --> 00:47:37,853
Santiago. Do you know where he is?

455
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:41,223
Do you know a Santiago?

456
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:43,349
Do you know where Santiago is?

457
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:45,121
Are you sure? You don't know where he is?

458
00:47:49,933 --> 00:47:51,332
Santiago!

459
00:48:12,956 --> 00:48:15,322
Tell these fools if they don't fess up,
we're callin' la migra.

460
00:48:15,425 --> 00:48:16,414
No!

461
00:48:16,493 --> 00:48:17,551
Enough!

462
00:48:19,329 --> 00:48:21,820
Young man.

463
00:48:31,875 --> 00:48:33,843
I know Santiago.

464
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:38,777
Why are you looking for him?

465
00:48:41,485 --> 00:48:44,579
I owe him money...

466
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:53,191
Sir, he stole my truck.

467
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:01,631
He was here yesterday.

468
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:11,479
I bought this phone from him for 40 dollars.
Is it yours?

469
00:49:11,682 --> 00:49:12,808
Yes.

470
00:49:19,723 --> 00:49:20,917
Apá, no!

471
00:49:20,991 --> 00:49:21,980
No.

472
00:49:23,593 --> 00:49:25,993
The boy is right.

473
00:49:29,099 --> 00:49:30,396
Thank you very much.

474
00:49:31,234 --> 00:49:33,327
Do you know where I can find him?

475
00:49:35,138 --> 00:49:39,973
He took his clothes and said he was moving.

476
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:41,902
Where to?

477
00:49:42,446 --> 00:49:45,347
He said he found a place closer to his work.

478
00:49:46,116 --> 00:49:47,481
Where does he work?

479
00:49:47,751 --> 00:49:49,184
Some restaurant.

480
00:49:49,386 --> 00:49:51,320
As a dishwasher. Night shifts.

481
00:49:51,588 --> 00:49:55,046
During the day,
I think he does construction.

482
00:49:58,161 --> 00:50:00,288
Apá, is this him?

483
00:50:03,934 --> 00:50:04,992
Yeah.

484
00:50:06,470 --> 00:50:07,664
Yeah, yeah. That's him.

485
00:50:08,805 --> 00:50:11,569
Do you mind if I keep the photo,
to find the place?

486
00:50:13,543 --> 00:50:15,568
Thank you sir, thank you very much.

487
00:50:19,082 --> 00:50:21,175
I'm sorry.

488
00:50:25,622 --> 00:50:26,611
Shit.

489
00:50:27,524 --> 00:50:30,721
Man, don't pay this fool, man.
He didn't take us to Santiago.

490
00:50:31,161 --> 00:50:32,628
That was not the deal.

491
00:50:33,630 --> 00:50:35,495
You shouldn't pay him.

492
00:50:35,966 --> 00:50:37,194
And what?

493
00:50:37,267 --> 00:50:39,497
Spit in his face? Fight him?

494
00:50:40,637 --> 00:50:43,299
We had a deal.
He kept his word, I keep mine.

495
00:50:43,407 --> 00:50:45,898
- No. Give him half!
- Stop talking like an ass!

496
00:50:57,154 --> 00:51:00,146
- Come on.
- Man, he played us, man.

497
00:51:48,305 --> 00:51:50,068
What's that?

498
00:51:54,845 --> 00:51:56,369
Nothing.

499
00:52:09,092 --> 00:52:12,528
- What time is it?
- 4:30.

500
00:52:14,397 --> 00:52:17,230
- Is anyone there?
- No.

501
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:19,325
Let's go in the back.

502
00:52:28,512 --> 00:52:31,640
Guess we gotta wait for this bitch to show.

503
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:34,740
What's that over there?

504
00:52:36,186 --> 00:52:37,983
That's where they have the charreadas.

505
00:52:38,355 --> 00:52:40,016
- What?
- The rodeo.

506
00:52:40,090 --> 00:52:43,116
I took you there with your Aunt Anita,
when you were five.

507
00:52:43,193 --> 00:52:46,890
- I don't remember.
- Really? You loved it.

508
00:52:51,568 --> 00:52:52,660
Come on.

509
00:53:09,786 --> 00:53:11,083
Where these people think they're at?

510
00:53:11,488 --> 00:53:13,080
Some Halloween party or something?

511
00:53:15,125 --> 00:53:16,820
This is where I'm coming from.

512
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:20,687
This is your people. They're you.

513
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:23,730
- They ain't me.
- Really?

514
00:53:23,833 --> 00:53:26,358
I'll get you a hat and some boots
and we'll see.

515
00:53:36,713 --> 00:53:38,078
No.

516
00:53:41,785 --> 00:53:44,447
Oh, now you look at her, when she turn, eh?

517
00:53:59,236 --> 00:54:01,329
I hate this kind of music.

518
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:02,598
What kind do you like?

519
00:54:03,206 --> 00:54:05,231
Anything but this.

520
00:54:07,310 --> 00:54:08,641
What's that fool been trying to say?

521
00:54:16,386 --> 00:54:17,375
Try.

522
00:54:22,292 --> 00:54:24,055
He's talking about...

523
00:54:24,127 --> 00:54:28,587
About how jumping horses is dangerous
and it's brave.

524
00:54:40,543 --> 00:54:42,010
That's dope.

525
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:39,762
Is that sherry? It's good.

526
00:55:52,949 --> 00:55:56,009
What are we gonna do at the nightclub?

527
00:55:56,086 --> 00:55:58,520
We're just gonna take the truck back.

528
00:55:58,588 --> 00:55:59,577
How?

529
00:56:00,824 --> 00:56:02,883
I have a spare key.

530
00:56:04,627 --> 00:56:08,620
I'm gonna open the door.
Climb in. Start the engine.

531
00:56:08,698 --> 00:56:10,325
And then we'll drive back home.

532
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:11,492
What if it's not there?

533
00:56:15,438 --> 00:56:17,235
It has to be there.

534
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:31,810
You remember this?

535
00:56:31,888 --> 00:56:33,583
- What?
- This song?

536
00:56:37,727 --> 00:56:40,628
- No. No.
- You don't remember it?

537
00:56:44,167 --> 00:56:46,101
Your mother used to sing it
to you when you were a baby.

538
00:56:46,169 --> 00:56:48,501
I don't wanna talk about her.

539
00:56:51,408 --> 00:56:52,500
Yeah, okay.

540
00:56:54,978 --> 00:56:56,138
Let's not talk about her.

541
00:56:56,946 --> 00:56:58,345
Forget her.

542
00:57:01,151 --> 00:57:02,209
I was talking about you.

543
00:57:04,354 --> 00:57:05,981
You used to love that song when you were...

544
00:57:06,055 --> 00:57:07,386
When I wasn't a pain in the ass?

545
00:57:09,125 --> 00:57:10,820
No.

546
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:14,294
When you were little.

547
00:57:21,671 --> 00:57:23,434
Why did you have me?

548
00:57:27,410 --> 00:57:28,502
What?

549
00:57:30,847 --> 00:57:32,747
Why do all these poor people have kids?

550
00:57:34,517 --> 00:57:36,144
What's the point?

551
00:57:48,598 --> 00:57:50,532
Don't say that, mijo.

552
00:57:51,935 --> 00:57:53,903
Don't say that.

553
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:38,707
Hey! Apá, come here!

554
00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:44,951
Is this it?

555
00:58:46,756 --> 00:58:48,246
I don't know.

556
00:58:52,562 --> 00:58:54,587
- No. This can't be it.
- Are you sure?

557
00:58:54,664 --> 00:58:56,393
Yeah. My windshield had a crack.

558
00:58:56,799 --> 00:58:57,959
Maybe he fixed it.

559
00:58:58,701 --> 00:59:01,829
- So fast? No.
- Check the keys. Check the keys.

560
00:59:08,878 --> 00:59:09,936
It doesn't work.

561
00:59:10,013 --> 00:59:11,480
Hold up. Let me see.

562
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:14,642
I just told you, it doesn't work!

563
00:59:14,784 --> 00:59:16,376
Everything's different. The flatbed!

564
00:59:16,452 --> 00:59:19,683
It doesn't have the rack!
Even the color is different!

565
00:59:30,767 --> 00:59:31,791
What are you gonna do?

566
00:59:32,502 --> 00:59:33,935
I'll talk to the bouncer.

567
00:59:34,003 --> 00:59:36,096
They ain't gonna let you in
dressed like that.

568
01:01:51,274 --> 01:01:52,434
Hey!

569
01:02:01,217 --> 01:02:02,912
Luis!

570
01:02:04,487 --> 01:02:05,818
Luis.

571
01:02:07,223 --> 01:02:08,281
Where's the truck?

572
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:10,549
No! No, no, no. Stop! Stop!

573
01:02:10,660 --> 01:02:13,629
- Please.
- Look at this! Look at this.

574
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:19,800
You sent the money home, you bastard.

575
01:02:22,038 --> 01:02:24,268
Did you sell the truck?

576
01:02:24,340 --> 01:02:25,500
Did you sell it? Answer me!

577
01:02:25,575 --> 01:02:27,873
No! Luis, enough!

578
01:02:27,944 --> 01:02:29,411
You wanna be nice to this bitch?

579
01:02:29,612 --> 01:02:30,636
Huh?

580
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:33,908
What about all that shit you said about
movin' to a better neighborhood?

581
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:36,645
To a better house? To a better school?

582
01:02:38,988 --> 01:02:40,649
How the hell are we gonna do it now?

583
01:02:41,691 --> 01:02:45,525
No! Calm down! Don't touch him anymore!

584
01:02:46,562 --> 01:02:49,497
What's wrong with you?

585
01:02:49,565 --> 01:02:51,624
You hit me, but you don't hit him?

586
01:02:52,368 --> 01:02:54,859
- I'm sorry. Calm down.
- Calm down?

587
01:02:54,937 --> 01:02:56,666
- Yeah. Yeah, Luis!
- Let go of me!

588
01:02:56,739 --> 01:02:59,708
- Let go of me!
- Luis!

589
01:04:01,337 --> 01:04:04,568
- Mr. Galindo?
- Is Luis here?

590
01:04:07,443 --> 01:04:09,707
I want to talk to him.

591
01:04:11,147 --> 01:04:13,479
Yeah, he's here.

592
01:04:13,616 --> 01:04:14,878
You wanna come in?

593
01:04:14,951 --> 01:04:17,215
No. I'll just wait outside.

594
01:04:17,820 --> 01:04:20,050
All right. Let me go get him.

595
01:04:37,573 --> 01:04:39,302
What's up?

596
01:04:42,378 --> 01:04:45,404
I tried calling you,
but your phone was turned off.

597
01:04:48,484 --> 01:04:50,850
You scared me last night.

598
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:52,785
I didn't want you to get in trouble.

599
01:04:53,356 --> 01:04:55,051
You ain't gotta worry about me.

600
01:04:55,424 --> 01:04:57,654
But I do worry.

601
01:04:57,727 --> 01:05:00,287
I worry about you all the time.

602
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:10,937
- Santiago told me where he sold the truck.
- Yeah?

603
01:05:15,244 --> 01:05:17,712
A black market.

604
01:05:18,014 --> 01:05:19,879
I'm gonna try to get it back.
You wanna come?

605
01:05:23,619 --> 01:05:25,018
No.

606
01:05:30,459 --> 01:05:31,926
Okay, then.

607
01:05:37,066 --> 01:05:38,658
I'll see you at home.

608
01:05:49,545 --> 01:05:52,139
Man, you is one ruthless gangsta.

609
01:05:52,715 --> 01:05:54,376
You a crazy kid.

610
01:05:54,884 --> 01:05:57,853
If I had a pops, I'd never do him like that.

611
01:05:58,988 --> 01:06:02,219
You cold. Freezing cold.

612
01:06:04,827 --> 01:06:08,285
Hey, yo, I decided
we should jump in this weekend.

613
01:06:08,364 --> 01:06:09,991
'Celo's down for it.

614
01:06:10,066 --> 01:06:12,193
But we should do like mi carnal did.

615
01:06:12,268 --> 01:06:16,329
When I saw him in lockup, he just said,
"Keep your head down."

616
01:06:16,405 --> 01:06:19,397
Yeah, man.
You just go in the streets with the homies.

617
01:06:19,575 --> 01:06:20,872
And when they make their circle

618
01:06:20,943 --> 01:06:23,571
you put your hands up around your head
and don't let go.

619
01:06:24,580 --> 01:06:26,104
And when they start swingin'...

620
01:06:27,750 --> 01:06:28,808
You feel me?

621
01:06:29,485 --> 01:06:32,386
As long as you cover your face, you cool.

622
01:06:35,191 --> 01:06:36,249
Where you goin', kid?

623
01:07:42,124 --> 01:07:43,113
Look.

624
01:07:45,027 --> 01:07:47,052
Yeah, someone's still working.

625
01:07:47,696 --> 01:07:50,324
Okay. I'm gonna go find a place
to climb this fence over.

626
01:07:52,034 --> 01:07:54,502
I want you to stay here, okay?
Just watch for the guard.

627
01:07:55,304 --> 01:07:58,467
If he leaves the booth, shout,
and get out of here.

628
01:07:59,075 --> 01:08:00,167
Okay, I'll climb back over.

629
01:08:00,443 --> 01:08:03,139
Hey, just do as I say. Okay?

630
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:07,715
I'll be okay.

631
01:08:08,150 --> 01:08:09,174
Be careful, mijo.

632
01:08:13,756 --> 01:08:15,280
You, too.

633
01:10:13,742 --> 01:10:15,266
The truck! The truck!

634
01:10:16,478 --> 01:10:17,502
Hang on.

635
01:10:21,984 --> 01:10:22,973
Hey.

636
01:10:24,153 --> 01:10:26,144
It'll be alright.

637
01:10:33,329 --> 01:10:34,990
You okay?

638
01:10:42,137 --> 01:10:44,002
The windshield's gone.

639
01:10:52,815 --> 01:10:54,783
Yeah! The tools are here!

640
01:10:59,622 --> 01:11:02,955
Start it! Start it! Start it! Start it!

641
01:11:03,025 --> 01:11:05,016
They're coming! Go! Go! Go!

642
01:11:06,262 --> 01:11:07,752
Shit!

643
01:11:09,198 --> 01:11:10,688
Get out of here.

644
01:11:17,906 --> 01:11:18,998
Get down!

645
01:11:35,791 --> 01:11:38,885
That was nuts, man! That was nuts!

646
01:11:38,961 --> 01:11:40,690
You're an ol' G, apá.

647
01:11:40,763 --> 01:11:44,631
Man, I've never seen
somethin' like that in my life! Never!

648
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:47,692
Man, that was the craziest shit
I've ever seen, ever!

649
01:11:47,770 --> 01:11:49,032
That was just incredible.

650
01:11:49,104 --> 01:11:51,766
That was just the most incredible thing
I've ever seen!

651
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:53,603
- Hey, Luis!
- What?

652
01:11:56,078 --> 01:11:57,841
Thanks for coming with me.

653
01:11:59,982 --> 01:12:02,746
Thanks for coming with me.

654
01:12:02,818 --> 01:12:03,944
Sure, apá.

655
01:12:05,754 --> 01:12:07,517
You're welcome, Dad.

656
01:12:27,576 --> 01:12:29,601
Drive. Apá, drive.

657
01:12:29,678 --> 01:12:32,010
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Drive. Drive. Drive.

658
01:12:38,554 --> 01:12:40,454
Go, go, go, go.

659
01:12:43,759 --> 01:12:45,386
Are they on us?

660
01:12:53,369 --> 01:12:54,996
Truck, pull over, please.

661
01:12:56,605 --> 01:12:58,163
Apá, drive.

662
01:12:59,608 --> 01:13:01,269
What are you doing? Go!

663
01:13:01,677 --> 01:13:03,304
Please, go!

664
01:13:03,379 --> 01:13:05,040
Apá, go!

665
01:13:17,693 --> 01:13:18,990
What are you...

666
01:13:20,696 --> 01:13:23,187
Stop it. Luis!

667
01:13:25,401 --> 01:13:26,390
Luis.

668
01:13:27,636 --> 01:13:29,263
- Please.
- Luis.

669
01:13:32,174 --> 01:13:33,607
No, mijo.

670
01:13:37,913 --> 01:13:38,902
Yeah.

671
01:13:50,459 --> 01:13:54,190
May I have your driver's license
and registration, please?

672
01:13:54,730 --> 01:13:56,493
Sir?

673
01:13:57,199 --> 01:13:59,190
Your license?

674
01:14:38,173 --> 01:14:42,371
Welcome to Agua Dulce. Pay attention.
I'm not going to repeat myself.

675
01:14:42,611 --> 01:14:48,948
You're going to remove all of your clothes.
Everything. Socks, underwear, shoes.

676
01:14:49,451 --> 01:14:54,013
All jewelry, watches, necklaces, rings, etc.

677
01:14:54,890 --> 01:14:56,858
There's no fighting allowed in this prison.

678
01:14:57,459 --> 01:15:00,223
If you are involved in a conflict of any kind...

679
01:15:00,629 --> 01:15:05,123
...You will be criminally charged just
as you would be on the street.

680
01:15:06,935 --> 01:15:11,838
We need to know right now
if you have HIV-AIDS...

681
01:15:12,407 --> 01:15:14,807
...Tuberculosis, hepatitis or any other

682
01:15:14,877 --> 01:15:19,576
communicable diseases
or medical conditions.

683
01:15:20,315 --> 01:15:25,218
A word to the gang members.
Gangs are not allowed here.

684
01:15:25,921 --> 01:15:28,754
If you are caught congregating,
segregating...

685
01:15:28,824 --> 01:15:35,229
...Holding meetings, organizing, recruiting,
practicing any kind of intimidation...

686
01:15:35,664 --> 01:15:41,466
...Throwing signs, defacing property,
you will be swiftly sent to isolation.

687
01:15:41,937 --> 01:15:43,666
You will be processed into

688
01:15:43,739 --> 01:15:46,640
the Department of Homeland Security's
immigrant database.

689
01:15:46,975 --> 01:15:52,470
Your information will be made available
to all Federal Law Enforcement Agencies...

690
01:15:53,048 --> 01:15:56,484
...As well as International Agencies
and Governments.

691
01:15:57,119 --> 01:16:00,816
You're going to receive a $5 calling card...

692
01:16:01,657 --> 01:16:06,287
...Issued by the Immigrant Hope Charity
group of Greater Los Angeles.

693
01:16:07,563 --> 01:16:09,030
And finally...

694
01:16:10,065 --> 01:16:12,590
...You're going to be released
into general population.

695
01:16:15,037 --> 01:16:17,198
Thank you for your attention.

696
01:16:29,952 --> 01:16:31,977
Before they took him away,

697
01:16:32,054 --> 01:16:35,148
Papá said it was cool for you
to sell the truck.

698
01:16:35,223 --> 01:16:37,157
Get your money back.

699
01:16:37,793 --> 01:16:40,318
Blasco's daughter's gonna pick it up.
So you're cool.

700
01:16:42,764 --> 01:16:44,459
That's what you think?

701
01:16:44,700 --> 01:16:46,930
That I'm cool with that?

702
01:16:48,236 --> 01:16:50,727
You want to know something
about that man?

703
01:16:51,573 --> 01:16:54,974
When I got here,
for six years he gave me a place

704
01:16:55,544 --> 01:16:57,978
and took care of me and fed me,
and protected me.

705
01:16:58,046 --> 01:16:59,707
Yeah, and then you got the hell out,
didn't you?

706
01:17:01,516 --> 01:17:03,245
You married some pendejo for your papers.

707
01:17:03,552 --> 01:17:06,350
You got out and left him, and left me.

708
01:17:06,421 --> 01:17:08,048
So don't be tellin' me you know him.

709
01:17:08,490 --> 01:17:10,617
I knew him!

710
01:17:10,692 --> 01:17:12,091
He's all I got.

711
01:17:13,328 --> 01:17:16,491
That's not true. I'm here for you.

712
01:17:20,302 --> 01:17:23,601
But I have rules in my house.
And you have to behave.

713
01:17:24,439 --> 01:17:27,840
If I see the slightest sign
that you're involved in any stuff,

714
01:17:28,910 --> 01:17:31,208
drugs or gang stuff, you're out.

715
01:17:32,447 --> 01:17:35,905
Linda's only 12 years old.
Do you understand?

716
01:17:35,984 --> 01:17:37,110
Yeah, I understand.

717
01:17:37,486 --> 01:17:39,681
Luis. Luis!

718
01:17:43,325 --> 01:17:46,658
Mr. Galindo.
Do you want me to speak Spanish?

719
01:17:46,928 --> 01:17:49,920
- I understand English.
- Okay. I work for an NGO

720
01:17:49,998 --> 01:17:51,693
that represents undocumented aliens.

721
01:17:51,967 --> 01:17:54,697
I need you to know
that I'm not with the government.

722
01:17:54,803 --> 01:17:58,102
The government doesn't provide
representation to illegal aliens.

723
01:17:58,273 --> 01:18:00,673
I'm not Immigration,
I have nothing to do with the ICE.

724
01:18:00,976 --> 01:18:03,774
- Yeah. I can't pay a lawyer.
- Right.

725
01:18:04,046 --> 01:18:05,536
I'm free.

726
01:18:05,614 --> 01:18:08,606
I'm just here to help advise you
about your choices.

727
01:18:08,684 --> 01:18:11,016
I don't cost anything.

728
01:18:11,420 --> 01:18:13,820
Okay. You have a decision to make,

729
01:18:14,690 --> 01:18:18,251
whether or not you plan
to contest removal from this country.

730
01:18:19,327 --> 01:18:22,455
If you tell the deportation officer
that you wish to fight,

731
01:18:22,531 --> 01:18:26,160
he will set a date in the future
for your removal hearing.

732
01:18:26,368 --> 01:18:29,269
If you tell him
you don't want to contest removal,

733
01:18:29,337 --> 01:18:33,398
then the judge will order
your immediate deportation.

734
01:18:33,775 --> 01:18:37,074
Is there a good reason you should
be concerned about returning to Mexico?

735
01:18:37,679 --> 01:18:41,638
- A political situation?
- I have a 14-year-old son here.

736
01:18:42,250 --> 01:18:44,343
I'm his only parent.

737
01:18:45,554 --> 01:18:46,714
And where is he now?

738
01:18:47,422 --> 01:18:48,480
With my sister.

739
01:18:49,224 --> 01:18:51,454
- Will she take care of him for you?
- Yeah.

740
01:18:52,994 --> 01:18:55,986
Okay. The judge is not gonna offer you bail.

741
01:18:56,164 --> 01:18:58,962
Regardless of your sole provider status.

742
01:19:00,602 --> 01:19:03,628
So, if you decide to fight deportation,

743
01:19:03,705 --> 01:19:06,173
you'll have to stay in this detention center
until your removal hearing.

744
01:19:07,309 --> 01:19:08,901
For how long?

745
01:19:08,977 --> 01:19:10,877
You can figure on at least three months,

746
01:19:10,946 --> 01:19:14,575
probably more like six,
before you can argue your case in court.

747
01:19:16,084 --> 01:19:17,244
And...

748
01:19:19,321 --> 01:19:22,119
Be honest, what are my chances?

749
01:19:23,058 --> 01:19:24,457
Zero.

750
01:19:24,526 --> 01:19:27,757
Not exactly zero,
but only 3% of all removal hearings

751
01:19:28,163 --> 01:19:30,631
result in the alien being granted asylum.

752
01:19:30,699 --> 01:19:34,100
Thousands of people are deported each year
with children younger than yours.

753
01:19:34,169 --> 01:19:37,104
Even aliens who pay taxes
with clean records.

754
01:19:41,143 --> 01:19:42,701
Give it some thought.

755
01:19:42,778 --> 01:19:45,372
You have until tomorrow
to make up your final decision.

756
01:19:50,352 --> 01:19:53,253
Mr. Galindo, I need to warn you

757
01:19:53,321 --> 01:19:55,812
that even though it would be
quicker and cheaper

758
01:19:55,891 --> 01:19:57,358
to have a coyote bring you back here,

759
01:19:59,694 --> 01:20:02,788
there would be legal consequences.

760
01:20:02,864 --> 01:20:04,695
Do you understand me?

761
01:20:06,535 --> 01:20:08,969
I want you to understand me.

762
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:21,014
I need that, homie.

763
01:20:31,860 --> 01:20:33,828
Take it.

764
01:20:37,332 --> 01:20:40,165
Crazy old bastard.

765
01:22:12,894 --> 01:22:14,225
Hello, mijo.

766
01:22:14,296 --> 01:22:16,696
Luis, are you there?

767
01:22:19,034 --> 01:22:23,437
I just called your Aunt Anita
and she told me you are not with her.

768
01:22:24,472 --> 01:22:26,099
Are you at home?

769
01:22:27,809 --> 01:22:30,334
If you are there, pick up, please.

770
01:22:31,313 --> 01:22:33,804
I really need to talk to you.

771
01:22:33,882 --> 01:22:36,942
I need to know that you're okay.

772
01:22:37,018 --> 01:22:39,213
I'm really worried about you.

773
01:22:43,358 --> 01:22:44,985
Listen, mijo.

774
01:22:47,329 --> 01:22:48,887
I'm going away.

775
01:22:50,765 --> 01:22:52,357
I can't help it.

776
01:22:53,101 --> 01:22:56,070
I don't know when they're sending me away.

777
01:22:56,137 --> 01:22:58,128
But you have to come soon.

778
01:22:59,240 --> 01:23:01,208
It might be the last...

779
01:23:02,677 --> 01:23:04,008
It might be...

780
01:23:09,851 --> 01:23:12,342
They say I can have one bag with me.

781
01:23:14,489 --> 01:23:16,980
Mijo, come soon, please.

782
01:23:17,926 --> 01:23:21,418
Just call Anita and come soon, all right?

783
01:23:22,364 --> 01:23:23,695
Okay, bye.

784
01:23:26,735 --> 01:23:29,499
Yo, Luis. Open up, gangsta.

785
01:23:30,572 --> 01:23:33,166
Where this fool at? Tell him to get out here!

786
01:23:33,441 --> 01:23:35,739
Stop orderin' me! You ain't my girlie, yo!

787
01:23:35,810 --> 01:23:38,574
- You wish!
- Hell, no!

788
01:23:39,447 --> 01:23:43,247
Come on, biatch! Open up this door!

789
01:24:25,927 --> 01:24:26,951
Go ahead.

790
01:24:29,397 --> 01:24:30,591
Excuse me, please.

791
01:24:30,665 --> 01:24:32,656
We are here to see my brother,
Carlos Galindo.

792
01:24:32,734 --> 01:24:35,362
- Slow down. What's the name?
- Carlos Galindo.

793
01:24:35,603 --> 01:24:40,063
- How do you spell that?
- G-A-L-l-N-D-O.

794
01:24:40,408 --> 01:24:41,773
He's been processed
for deportation already.

795
01:24:43,178 --> 01:24:45,203
- No, that is not possible.
- He's gone already.

796
01:24:45,613 --> 01:24:47,308
I'm sorry. Next.

797
01:24:49,284 --> 01:24:51,115
Please, sir, can you check the list again?

798
01:24:51,352 --> 01:24:52,717
It says he's been processed already.

799
01:24:53,388 --> 01:24:54,821
- Next.
- Wait. I know he's here.

800
01:24:59,094 --> 01:25:00,220
Please.

801
01:25:09,471 --> 01:25:10,529
Galindo.

802
01:25:11,806 --> 01:25:12,864
Galindo!

803
01:25:41,536 --> 01:25:43,333
Make it quick.

804
01:25:50,311 --> 01:25:52,404
Thank you.

805
01:25:53,581 --> 01:25:54,843
Anita brought you?

806
01:25:58,086 --> 01:26:00,919
You're gonna have to stay with her.

807
01:26:16,471 --> 01:26:18,701
You asked me...

808
01:26:19,707 --> 01:26:21,766
You asked me why I had you.

809
01:26:25,046 --> 01:26:26,411
You know, back in the village,

810
01:26:26,481 --> 01:26:29,575
you just did what any man would do.

811
01:26:30,451 --> 01:26:33,648
You found a novia, got married,

812
01:26:35,423 --> 01:26:38,483
and then you headed north.

813
01:26:39,093 --> 01:26:42,324
And that's what I did,
'cause I didn't know any different.

814
01:26:45,133 --> 01:26:47,226
So we came here.

815
01:26:50,305 --> 01:26:51,772
And then,

816
01:26:53,374 --> 01:26:54,705
we had you.

817
01:26:56,611 --> 01:26:57,976
Why?

818
01:26:59,847 --> 01:27:02,907
Because your mother and I loved each other
very much.

819
01:27:07,388 --> 01:27:09,356
But then, people change.

820
01:27:12,760 --> 01:27:15,490
And things were different here.

821
01:27:16,664 --> 01:27:18,188
Your mother changed.

822
01:27:18,266 --> 01:27:21,463
She wanted more than I could give her.

823
01:27:23,972 --> 01:27:26,497
So, she went away.

824
01:27:27,542 --> 01:27:30,102
And I was left alone with you.

825
01:27:30,745 --> 01:27:32,337
I didn't know how I was going to manage

826
01:27:32,413 --> 01:27:35,974
with a small boy,
with no money and no regular job.

827
01:27:38,119 --> 01:27:40,417
I had a lot of anger inside me.

828
01:27:45,560 --> 01:27:47,323
But the thing...

829
01:27:49,430 --> 01:27:51,990
The one thing

830
01:27:52,367 --> 01:27:57,134
that helped me get over all that

831
01:28:02,744 --> 01:28:04,234
Was you.

832
01:28:06,114 --> 01:28:08,708
To be able to take care of you,

833
01:28:10,385 --> 01:28:12,410
and watch you grow.

834
01:28:12,787 --> 01:28:13,776
Because I love you.

835
01:28:13,855 --> 01:28:16,722
You are the most important thing
in this world to me, mijo.

836
01:28:21,596 --> 01:28:22,585
I...

837
01:28:25,266 --> 01:28:30,704
I wanted you to be able
to be anything you wanted to be.

838
01:28:36,277 --> 01:28:38,837
That would make me feel worthy.

839
01:28:41,916 --> 01:28:46,683
If you became somebody.

840
01:28:50,058 --> 01:28:51,082
That's why I had you.

841
01:28:53,361 --> 01:28:55,488
For me.

842
01:28:57,632 --> 01:28:59,930
For me.

843
01:29:00,001 --> 01:29:01,730
For a reason to live.

844
01:29:08,910 --> 01:29:11,242
I'm sorry about this.

845
01:29:11,312 --> 01:29:14,145
I wish you didn't have to see me like this.

846
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:27,284
I'm sorry about failing you.

847
01:29:27,595 --> 01:29:30,086
No. You never failed me.

848
01:29:30,765 --> 01:29:32,960
- I was never there.
- You were always there.

849
01:29:33,668 --> 01:29:35,966
You were always there. Always.

850
01:29:46,314 --> 01:29:50,648
Papá, you remember that song at the rodeo?

851
01:29:52,487 --> 01:29:54,011
The song?

852
01:29:55,123 --> 01:29:56,954
It was you, wasn't it?

853
01:29:57,024 --> 01:29:59,618
You used to sing it to me when I was little.

854
01:30:01,295 --> 01:30:04,560
I asked the shoemaker
to make me some shoes

855
01:30:04,899 --> 01:30:08,767
With a round little beak
like ducks have

856
01:30:12,940 --> 01:30:14,601
Damned shoemaker

857
01:30:14,675 --> 01:30:16,233
He cheated me

858
01:30:16,444 --> 01:30:19,242
He made me the shoes
but not the little beak

859
01:30:24,085 --> 01:30:26,451
Sorry. It's time to go.

860
01:30:27,922 --> 01:30:30,720
Luis, you gotta promise me
you're gonna stay with Anita, okay?

861
01:30:31,159 --> 01:30:33,354
And you're gonna give the new school
a chance, all right?

862
01:30:33,661 --> 01:30:34,821
Promise me that? Okay?

863
01:30:34,929 --> 01:30:36,055
Okay, I'm going, man. Okay.

864
01:30:36,130 --> 01:30:37,961
Okay, but you promise me!

865
01:30:38,332 --> 01:30:40,129
You promise me you're coming home!

866
01:30:40,201 --> 01:30:42,294
You promise me you're coming back!

867
01:30:42,637 --> 01:30:44,798
- Apá, you promise me, okay?
- Yes, mijo.

868
01:30:45,273 --> 01:30:46,968
You promise me you're coming back!

869
01:30:47,041 --> 01:30:48,065
- You can't leave me here!
- Yeah.

870
01:30:48,142 --> 01:30:50,576
Promise me you're coming home!
Promise me...

871
01:31:38,259 --> 01:31:41,422
Four Months Later

872
01:32:14,562 --> 01:32:16,120
Ready?

873
01:32:17,098 --> 01:32:18,861
To the other side.

874
01:32:21,536 --> 01:32:24,061
Let's go home.
