1
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:55,670
Who are you?

2
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:02,510
We're with
the opera troupe.

3
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:05,430
Oh, I didn't recognize you!

4
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:12,770
I'm a great fan of you both.

5
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:16,990
Is that so? Thank you.

6
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,990
It's been over twenty years since
you performed together, hasn't it?

7
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:27,000
Twenty-one.

8
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:28,580
Twenty-two.

9
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,960
Yes, twenty-two years.

10
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:36,380
And it's been ten years
since we last saw each other.

11
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:37,880
Eleven. Eleven years.

12
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:42,680
that's right, eleven years. Yes.

13
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:46,470
It's due to the Gang of Four
and the Cultural Revolution.

14
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,810
Right!

15
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:53,810
Yeah, that's right.

16
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:56,400
Things are better now.

17
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:01,110
that's for sure.

18
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:05,030
Everything's fine now.

19
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,000
Please, wait here a moment.
I'll go turn on the lights.

20
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,630
Sorry to trouble you.

21
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:30,790
1924
BEIJI NG - THE WARLORD ERA

22
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,960
Yanhong, is that you?
I've really missed you.

23
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:40,840
Whore!

24
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:01,820
Ladies and gentlemen,

25
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,820
enjoy the show!

26
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:45,690
You, cunning asshole!

27
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:48,530
Laizi is trying to run away again.
Brat! See how far you get!

28
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,570
Quick, go catch him!

29
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:55,660
I'm sorry.

30
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:57,250
Gentlemen, please be patient.

31
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:01,090
Trash ! how dare you
show yourselves around here?

32
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,980
Fuck you all !

33
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:24,780
Just as sure as my name
is Shitou. . .

34
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:28,900
I'll give you something
to look at.

35
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:12,320
What are you screaming for?
I haven't even said hello yet!

36
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:18,290
You're a disgrace to
the opera troupe.

37
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,750
You couldn't even
play a monkey right.

38
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:26,710
Thought you'd get away
with that brick act, didn't you?

39
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:29,760
It's garbage.

40
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:54,240
Sharpen your knives!

41
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:59,330
Sharpen your knives!

42
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:19,810
This child isn't fated
to be an actor.

43
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:23,230
Not with that extra finger.

44
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:29,020
He have a good face,
but he can't.

45
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:33,950
Sharpen your knives!

46
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:36,030
I can afford to raise him. . .

47
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:41,080
but he's getting too big
to keep at the brothel.

48
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:43,460
If only you take him,
you can do anything you like.

49
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:53,130
Don't look down on us.

50
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,300
don't be foolish.
Prostitutes and actors

51
00:07:56,470 --> 00:08:01,390
are equally despised
by society.

52
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:05,940
Just go away.

53
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:39,140
Ma, my hands are freezing.
They feel like ice.

54
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:13,940
Ma!

55
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,590
Get away from us,
you son of a whore!

56
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:50,270
It's from the whore house!
Drop it on the foor!

57
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:26,300
Are you bullying him?

58
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:29,640
Come over here.
Sleep with me!

59
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,450
You're really something !

60
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:47,530
Laizi, go snuggle up
with the Little Monk.

61
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,120
Catch !

62
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:00,340
It's so cold outside. . .

63
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:05,590
the piss froze
on the tip of my dick.

64
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,260
I nearly turned
a somersault!

65
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:29,700
If you belong to the human
race, you go to the opera.

66
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,040
Pigs and dogs
don't listen to opera.

67
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:38,080
If you don't go to the opera,

68
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:41,170
you're not a human being.

69
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:46,470
And where there's opera,
there's work for us actors!

70
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:52,470
Stop squealing !

71
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:01,110
Straighten that back!

72
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:07,610
If you think
you're above everyone else. . .

73
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:12,080
you'll learn the hard way.
This is just the beginning.

74
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:20,630
Don't worry, Douzi.

75
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,590
We're already half way
through.

76
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:30,090
Shitou, are you helping
someone cheat?

77
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:34,640
Master, I was looking up.
I didn't notice what was on the floor.

78
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:36,770
Bullshit! Get me my sword.

79
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:43,270
And hurry up!

80
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:01,250
Get up!

81
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:10,590
Don't you have something to say?

82
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,260
Yes. Forming cliques is
prohibited and wi'll be punished.

83
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,230
He's not fucking scared
of anything.

84
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,150
From the time opera began. . .

85
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:32,490
It's never enjoyed such
popularity as it does today!

86
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,450
You're lucky to be part of it!

87
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:35,830
We are!

88
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:01,690
Heavens will...
not a lack of material skill. . .

89
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:05,690
I've been practicing
kung fu

90
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:15,240
to keep myself warm.

91
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:19,790
It's cool out side, quite cool.

92
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:28,550
But I've become a man of fire.
Get away from me.

93
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:42,310
I am so strong,
I can uproot the Mountains. .

94
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:48,770
My courage is renowned

95
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:58,450
I've fallen on bad times

96
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:22,730
Yet even my horse
Won't run away to save itself.

97
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:27,350
These are our rules.
We must learn them well.

98
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:31,690
From ancient times,
man has needed a skill.

99
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:35,740
If you devote yourself to this,
you'll get paid off.

100
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:40,370
Now go off and practice!

101
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:44,620
Let's hear Fleeing by Night.

102
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:49,380
I look back at the Celestial Court
and hurry on wards in fight. . .

103
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,800
Heedless of. . . heedless of. . .

104
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,590
Heedless of what?

105
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58,340
Heedless of loyalty
and filial piety.

106
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:04,560
I am so strong,
I can uproot the mountains.

107
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:09,480
Yet even my horse
Won't run away to save itself.

108
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:12,360
And my beloved concubine,
what shall I do about her?

109
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,740
Excellent, not a word out of place.
Give me your hand.

110
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:23,490
This is so you'll remember
to do as well the next time.

111
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:29,670
I am a nun. .

112
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:33,590
At sixteen I am a nun.
My hair is shorn at youth's prime.

113
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,420
Go on.

114
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:39,470
I am by nature a boy...

115
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,470
I am by nature a boy...

116
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:49,350
You are by nature a girl !

117
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:52,360
I'll punish you, Laizi !
You still can't get it right, can you?

118
00:17:57,490 --> 00:17:58,950
Don't hit me!
I won't do it again !

119
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:11,000
I am. . . I am by nature. . .

120
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:14,050
Spit it out!

121
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,210
I am by nature a boy. . .

122
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:20,550
Is a nun a male or a female?

123
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:22,970
A. . .

124
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:23,640
A boy. . .

125
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:30,350
You really are in character.
You can't even tell male from female.

126
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:47,330
I-l-l am by nature a boy. . .

127
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:53,790
You've forgotten everything
the master has taught you!

128
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,050
Do it again, and I'll beat you
within an inch of your life.

129
00:18:57,090 --> 00:19:00,010
You'd better remember this.

130
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:30,870
If by chance
I'm beaten to death tomorrow. . .

131
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,590
The three copper coins
hidden under my mattress.

132
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:41,670
Careful !

133
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:46,970
Don't water your hand !

134
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:59,940
Douzi, in a few days, you'll be
initiated into the troupe.

135
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:04,820
Just pretend you're a girl,
and don't mess up the lyrics again.

136
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:21,590
Laizi, have you ever eaten
sweet pea cakes?

137
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:24,930
Whats the big deal
about sweet peacakes?

138
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:26,140
How about millet rolls?

139
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,600
Basin cakes?

140
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:29,930
The're about as fucking
special as dog farts.

141
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:31,850
So what do you like?

142
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:39,520
There's nothing yummier
than a stick of candied crab apples.

143
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:44,150
If I make it big, I'll eat candied
crab apples every day for dinner.

144
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:56,870
Candied crab apples for sale!
Candied crab apples for sale!

145
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:02,170
Don't look at us like that.
We're not sticks of apple.

146
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:06,180
Laizi,
you're drooling !

147
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,140
Laizi,
What the hell are you doing?

148
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:19,940
Wow, so many big kites!

149
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:40,750
Douzi, we got only 2 days
to go.

150
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:42,290
Run for it!

151
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:48,260
Come back!

152
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,140
Douzi !
we got 2days. .

153
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:59,810
Don't forget the money
under my pillow.

154
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:10,990
You're worthless.
Get out of my sight!

155
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,960
Where'd you get that?

156
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:27,170
Forget Shitou.
I'm spending your money now.

157
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:31,640
Ten apples on each stick.
I'll give you two.

158
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,760
What's wrong with you?

159
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:34,810
I have to pee real bad.

160
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:38,020
Not in the middle
of the street.

161
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:41,190
It's Manager Wang !

162
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:44,820
The stars have arrived !
here, come this way.

163
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:56,660
My dear sir, this is like
a visit from heaven !

164
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:04,090
All you need to do is sneeze
and you get a standing ovation.

165
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:12,260
Thanks for coming here.

166
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:45,420
We'll be lucky if no one
is trampled to death in there!

167
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:54,680
I'll sit on your shoulders
for a while, then you sit on mine.

168
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,420
The king !
It's the King of Chu!

169
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,920
What does it take
to become a star?

170
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:35,220
How many beatings?

171
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:39,760
When I'll ever enjoy
such fame?

172
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:19,010
You're pissing all over me!
Are you nuts?

173
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:38,280
I knew you'd go back.
You couldn't live without Shitou!

174
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:42,990
We're going to get a taste of
the sword. But I'm not afraid.

175
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:47,500
For me, it's like having
an itch scratched.

176
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:52,250
I've eaten my candied crab apple.
I'm a fucking star already.

177
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:59,970
You little runts,
you've come back after all.

178
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:02,930
Good ! I deserve it!
Good ! I deserve it!

179
00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:06,850
Why the hell did you
Let them go?

180
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:21,490
Die you runts!

181
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:26,120
Skipping class and running away
must be punished !

182
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,960
Master, I'll never do it again.
Please let me go!

183
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:34,130
You let them get away?
Assholes!

184
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:52,150
Master!

185
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:57,400
I wouldn't dare do it again,
master. I was wrong.

186
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:00,240
Beat me instead !

187
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:04,470
Didn't you think youd get yours?
I'll kill you!

188
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:09,600
Douzi,
speak! Say something !

189
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:12,440
Beg for mercy!
Say he's beaten you well !

190
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,440
Speak!
Let's just disband the troupe!

191
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:31,250
Youre killing Douzi !

192
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:37,670
I won't let you do this!

193
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:48,180
Master Guan !

194
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:50,600
Laizi, he-

195
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:51,120
This opera tells the story of war
between the Chu and han kings.

196
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:54,790
What sort of a man
was the King of Chu?

197
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:59,210
A peerless
and invincible hero. . .

198
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:03,710
a bold and resourceful general
capable of defeating vast armies.

199
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:09,340
But fate wasn't on his side.

200
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:13,390
At Gaixia he was outwitted. . .

201
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:17,730
by the Han king.

202
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:21,770
As they prepared for battle,
Han's troops sang victory songs. . .

203
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:26,240
because of Han's military tatics,

204
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,610
the Chu armies fed in a
great panic

205
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:31,740
had their country taken by Han.

206
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,500
Even the king was weeping.

207
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:41,670
No matter how resourceful
you are. . .

208
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:45,800
you can't fight fate.

209
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:50,760
The king had once been
all-powerful, but in the end. . .

210
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:55,390
all he had left was one woman
and one horse.

211
00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:00,140
He tried to get his steed
to run away, but it wouldn't go.

212
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:03,690
he wanted his concubine to free,
but she wouldn't.

213
00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:08,150
For the very last time, Concubine
poured wine for her king. . .

214
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:11,160
and danced for him
with a sword. . .

215
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:14,660
then cut her throat with it,

216
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:17,290
to keep her fidelity.

217
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:25,540
Theres a lesson in this story
for all of us. . .

218
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,260
that each person is responsible
for his or her own fate.

219
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:32,260
You better keep that
in your mind.

220
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:48,780
I am so strong,
I can uproot the Mountains

221
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:55,280
My courage is renowned

222
00:31:55,450 --> 00:32:03,250
I've fallen on bad times

223
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:07,920
Yet even my horse won't
run away to save itself

224
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:20,220
Old Man Zhang has commissioned
you to hire an opera troupe.

225
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:23,600
I truly congratulate you.

226
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:28,320
With your patronage, the children
will have new clothes to wear.

227
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:34,490
Good opera, however,
is not so simple.

228
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:37,370
When he was a palace eunuch. . .

229
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:42,660
Old Man Zhang attended operas
with the Empress Dowager herself.

230
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:49,300
I could lose a lot of respect.
But that's nothing.

231
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:52,880
You realize that if the performance
doesn't make the grade...

232
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:57,510
This kids got something.

233
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:59,640
How long he's been in training?

234
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,350
Douzi, come here

235
00:33:02,770 --> 00:33:04,810
and pay your respects.

236
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:22,540
he's got
a nice little figure too.

237
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:25,330
Can you sing any
old-style operas?

238
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:27,540
Yes, two.

239
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:32,760
Fleeing by Night is for male and
outside the Nunnery is for female...

240
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:34,380
Let's hear a bit of the last.

241
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:40,720
At sixteen I am a nun. . .

242
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:46,310
my hair shorn
at youths prime.

243
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,940
Yet I am by nature a boy,

244
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:53,400
not a girl...

245
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:55,440
Why-

246
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:03,290
Mr. Na, I am terribly sorry!

247
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:06,460
he's usually very good.

248
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:12,420
Master Guan,
I'll see you some other time.

249
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:21,600
Open your mouth. open it!

250
00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:28,520
You've screwed it up
for all of us!

251
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:33,400
I'll teach you.

252
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,390
I am by nature a girl,

253
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:13,810
I am by nature a girl,

254
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,710
At sixteen I am a nun. . .

255
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:38,670
my hair shorn at youths prime.

256
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:42,590
Yet I am by nature a girl,
not a boy.

257
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:46,100
Why must I wear
these sexless robes?

258
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:48,600
I see the joyful couples pass. . .

259
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:55,440
in their splendid brocades.

260
00:35:55,480 --> 00:36:10,830
Despite myself,
desire burns in my heart. . .

261
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:31,730
Year after year
All over the land

262
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:37,610
I've followed my king
on his military campaigns

263
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:44,530
enduring the wind
And frost and hard toil. .

264
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:52,120
Our people are fallen
into abyss of misery. .

265
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,180
This little boy. . .

266
00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:11,770
Master Guan. . .

267
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,770
Mr. Zhang, may you live
as long as South Mountain.

268
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:26,910
The king is here.

269
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:36,420
Your highness

270
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:48,010
The people have suffered
untold hardship and pain

271
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:58,600
this is an old man Zhan's special

272
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,570
reward for two kids.

273
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:09,740
So take this.

274
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,200
Yes, sir!

275
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:17,670
The Chu king would
have won with this sword !

276
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:20,210
If I were emperor,
then you'd be queen of the palace.

277
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,300
Take that sword.

278
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:26,720
Careful, kidys!

279
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,720
That's a real blade!

280
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:36,100
No need to run !

281
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,520
What's wrong?

282
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:43,110
The sweat stings the scratchs

283
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:45,780
Have them go together.

284
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:50,950
No way.
It's an old rule around here.

285
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:56,200
Master Guan, I'm sorry
if you don't understand.

286
00:38:56,250 --> 00:39:00,710
The concubine has to die
one way or the other.

287
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:02,080
Isn't it so?

288
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:08,920
Master?

289
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:11,720
Douzi !

290
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:52,800
What year is this?

291
00:39:52,930 --> 00:39:58,100
This is. . . this is 1932.

292
00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:04,020
Wrong !
This is still the Ching dynasty!

293
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:08,110
Come over here.

294
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:12,280
I. . . I want to find Shitou.

295
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,870
I need to pee.

296
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:29,420
Pee into this.

297
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:33,800
Don't waste it.
just pee into this.

298
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:13,220
Come to me!

299
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,010
Douzi !

300
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:02,890
What's happened to you?

301
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:07,900
Have you gone dumb?
Speak to me!

302
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:34,420
Douzi.

303
00:42:35,210 --> 00:42:38,130
Fate has determined
each of our lots.

304
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:41,180
Leave him to his destiny.

305
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:28,180
All right, look at the camera!

306
00:43:39,530 --> 00:43:42,490
Gentlemen, you have done
grandly for yourselves.

307
00:43:42,570 --> 00:43:45,200
You look so dignified and stunning
in any style of clothing.

308
00:43:45,330 --> 00:43:49,160
That's it!

309
00:44:01,590 --> 00:44:04,260
Oppose Japans invasion
of North China!

310
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:08,930
Damn !
It's those students again.

311
00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:19,150
1937
ON THE EVE OF WAR WITH JAPAN

312
00:44:22,990 --> 00:44:26,240
Down with Japanese imperialism!

313
00:44:26,410 --> 00:44:29,250
Are'nt they the opera actors?

314
00:44:31,290 --> 00:44:34,250
How can you put on make up
and sing opera at a time like this?

315
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:37,670
Have you no feeling
for your country?

316
00:44:40,170 --> 00:44:45,180
We're Chinese too,
Chinese to the core!

317
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:48,260
Look at us,
goddamn it!

318
00:44:50,930 --> 00:44:56,690
Chinese mustn't fight
among themselves!

319
00:44:59,020 --> 00:45:01,280
we're all Chinese here!

320
00:45:02,190 --> 00:45:05,280
And don ' t you forget it!

321
00:45:08,990 --> 00:45:11,450
How dare they pretend
to be patriotic!

322
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:17,590
Why don't they go out
and fight the Japanese soldiers?

323
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:21,630
Cause you're penniless
for women and marriage. .

324
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:23,220
Do something !

325
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:27,340
You just want to find
a way out...

326
00:45:28,050 --> 00:45:31,600
The one who was yelling the
loudest would make a good actor.

327
00:45:32,390 --> 00:45:35,310
Remember the first time we
performed Farewell, My Concubine?

328
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:38,110
Only you remember
that kind of thing.

329
00:45:38,230 --> 00:45:43,320
I know.

330
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:48,660
It was your lucky day
for you.

331
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:51,160
Back then it was...

332
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:53,330
I went there yesterday.

333
00:45:53,370 --> 00:45:55,330
I know you've been looking

334
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:56,710
for the sword, but it's long gone.

335
00:46:04,670 --> 00:46:07,680
Long life for Deyie!

336
00:46:08,430 --> 00:46:11,680
Candied crab apples for sale!

337
00:46:12,430 --> 00:46:15,430
Candied crab apples for sale!

338
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:19,060
We've got a sea of people.

339
00:46:19,190 --> 00:46:22,570
They're craning their necks
to catch a glimpse of their idols.

340
00:46:23,070 --> 00:46:28,160
Even master Yuan is here to see
you. It's a great honor for us.

341
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:40,710
Go away!
Go away!

342
00:47:00,270 --> 00:47:01,360
Mr. Duan. . .

343
00:47:02,770 --> 00:47:05,780
They're becoming impatient,
please hurry!

344
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:10,240
Trust me.

345
00:47:10,610 --> 00:47:13,620
They won't feel like they are
wasting their money.

346
00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:37,770
Year after year
all over the land

347
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:48,280
I've followed my king
on his military campaigns

348
00:48:01,290 --> 00:48:07,250
You be the judge.
Has he not blurred

349
00:48:07,670 --> 00:48:16,220
I hate only the lawless tyrant
Who plunged our people. . .of misery

350
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:23,560
the distinction between theater
and. . . male and female?

351
00:48:23,770 --> 00:48:25,820
He is now at the level of. .

352
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:49,800
Your highness

353
00:49:02,770 --> 00:49:06,270
Ive caused you

354
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:15,660
So much grief

355
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:24,710
So, Master Yuan has come
to see us tonight.

356
00:49:25,710 --> 00:49:30,550
I know. I sang so loudly,

357
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:33,380
I drowned out the horns.

358
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:37,640
I'll show him how great
we are without his patronage. .

359
00:49:37,890 --> 00:49:39,350
But Duan. .

360
00:49:39,470 --> 00:49:40,850
Don't worry.

361
00:49:41,430 --> 00:49:43,390
At key moments. . .

362
00:49:43,430 --> 00:49:46,690
I squeezed my waist
with my hands. . .

363
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:52,360
so it hurts. .

364
00:49:54,450 --> 00:49:55,490
here?

365
00:50:11,590 --> 00:50:13,880
Master Yuan !

366
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:18,010
It's an honor.

367
00:50:30,650 --> 00:50:34,780
You deserve this.

368
00:50:44,790 --> 00:50:51,420
the Empress Dowager herself. . .

369
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:54,340
never bestowed such a gift

370
00:50:54,460 --> 00:50:56,760
upon her favorite actors.

371
00:51:01,350 --> 00:51:05,520
Master Yuan, how can our Dieyi
be worthy of your favor?

372
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:13,770
Farewell, My Concubine
has a long history.

373
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:19,700
It evolved from the old-style opera
Story of the Precious one.

374
00:51:20,740 --> 00:51:23,870
Many famous actors
have fallen down in this role.

375
00:51:24,990 --> 00:51:27,540
I've never seen an actor

376
00:51:27,870 --> 00:51:30,920
as great as you are.

377
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:38,720
Impressive.

378
00:51:44,890 --> 00:51:47,480
For a moment or two. . .

379
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:51,350
this Yuan fellow
was so entranced. . .

380
00:51:52,690 --> 00:51:55,900
He believed Concubine Yu
had actually come back to life!

381
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:02,740
Master Duan. . .

382
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:08,410
When the king returns to camp
and meets Concubine Yu. . .

383
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:11,420
custom has it-

384
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:19,510
He takes seven steps.
You take but five.

385
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:22,840
If the King of Chu fails to bear
himself with majestic dignity. . .

386
00:52:23,590 --> 00:52:28,770
He's little better than a gangster
putting on airs!

387
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:32,690
Master Yuan, you are a master
of the theater arts.

388
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:37,070
You are an expert in all the
varieties and facets of opera.

389
00:52:39,070 --> 00:52:41,150
I may probably be

390
00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:45,030
as you say.

391
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:47,120
Please give us the benefit
of your advice and criticism.

392
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:53,040
If it's not beneath you,

393
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:56,710
I'd like to invite you. . .
to my humble home for some wine.

394
00:52:57,130 --> 00:53:01,760
There is still so much
to be said about this opera.

395
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:05,050
Im terribly sorry, Master Yuan.

396
00:53:05,590 --> 00:53:07,930
I've another drinking
engagement... with a courtesan.

397
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:11,560
With a courtesan...
