1
00:00:25,469 --> 00:00:35,375
 

2
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:35,328
Are you a top or a bottom?

3
00:02:36,779 --> 00:02:37,832
I beg your pardon?

4
00:02:38,407 --> 00:02:39,407
I mean in real life.

5
00:02:40,389 --> 00:02:42,532
This is real life.

6
00:02:43,146 --> 00:02:44,550
Let me put it this way:

7
00:02:45,568 --> 00:02:47,127
Do you think we should get out of Iraq?

8
00:02:47,195 --> 00:02:48,195
Is your daddy paying for this?

9
00:02:48,537 --> 00:02:49,537
No.

10
00:02:52,222 --> 00:02:54,565
You're taking a picture of yourself at Ground Zero --

11
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,570
do you smile?

12
00:02:57,484 --> 00:02:58,853
Get on the fucking bed!

13
00:04:17,427 --> 00:04:19,379
If you could have any superpower,
what would it be?

14
00:04:20,033 --> 00:04:22,032
The power to make you interesting.

15
00:04:23,838 --> 00:04:26,150
Do you think you'll ever have kids?

16
00:04:26,185 --> 00:04:27,312
You only have an hour.

17
00:04:27,347 --> 00:04:28,440
It's my money.

18
00:04:29,397 --> 00:04:32,080
Well, you fucking trust fund ** piece of fetish shit!

19
00:04:32,491 --> 00:04:33,443
I'm sorry!

20
00:04:33,478 --> 00:04:34,478
I'm sorry what?

21
00:04:34,506 --> 00:04:35,506
I'm sorry, Mistress Severin.

22
00:04:36,421 --> 00:04:37,421
But I'm serious.

23
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:39,671
What are your thoughts on procreation?

24
00:04:40,969 --> 00:04:41,969
I want to do it by myself,

25
00:04:43,193 --> 00:04:44,193
in the dark.

26
00:04:44,549 --> 00:04:45,767
Like a worm.

27
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:39,504
Can you describe your last orgasm?

28
00:05:39,972 --> 00:05:41,589
It was great.

29
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:45,708
It was like time had stopped
and I was completely alone.

30
00:05:52,849 --> 00:05:53,849
Let's go, partner.

31
00:05:56,924 --> 00:05:58,763
I'm gonna miss my fucking train.

32
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:22,519
Oh, God, oh.

33
00:06:25,598 --> 00:06:26,598
Oh, easy, easy.

34
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,579
Were you sad afterwards?

35
00:06:48,222 --> 00:06:49,222
Yeah.

36
00:06:50,514 --> 00:06:51,514
Why?

37
00:06:52,574 --> 00:06:54,613
Cause time hadn't stopped.

38
00:06:56,075 --> 00:06:57,714
And I wasn't alone.

39
00:07:06,598 --> 00:07:08,374
Hey hon, I'm home!

40
00:07:11,157 --> 00:07:12,157
Hey.

41
00:07:12,628 --> 00:07:13,945
You doing yoga?

42
00:07:14,188 --> 00:07:15,188
Yeah.

43
00:07:15,189 --> 00:07:16,189
Sorry, I would have been here sooner.

44
00:07:16,789 --> 00:07:18,849
Somebody threw themselves in front of the L train.

45
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,180
Hey.
- Hey.

46
00:07:25,074 --> 00:07:26,417
God, you're so sweaty.

47
00:07:26,686 --> 00:07:27,686
I love it.

48
00:07:29,693 --> 00:07:31,597
Wow!
- I just jerked off, actually.

49
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:33,652
You did?

50
00:07:35,032 --> 00:07:36,999
Did you think of me?

51
00:07:40,314 --> 00:07:42,131
I'll go put on some clothes.

52
00:07:45,043 --> 00:07:46,578
This is recording!

53
00:07:46,579 --> 00:07:47,579
Fuck!

54
00:07:51,233 --> 00:07:53,559
When are you going to let me see
what you're working on?

55
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,560
Soon.

56
00:08:08,366 --> 00:08:09,366
Thank you.

57
00:08:11,276 --> 00:08:12,661
Thank <i>you</i>...

58
00:08:14,514 --> 00:08:15,514
cutie.

59
00:08:16,473 --> 00:08:18,003
That was--
oh God, that was incredible.

60
00:08:18,545 --> 00:08:19,898
Definitely.

61
00:08:27,009 --> 00:08:29,545
Look, I do feel sorry for people who don't have what we have.

62
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:35,530
Like Brad and Cheryl.

63
00:08:36,989 --> 00:08:38,204
Brad and Cheryl?

64
00:08:38,915 --> 00:08:41,796
Yeah, the couple I've been working with.

65
00:08:43,432 --> 00:08:45,105
Can you keep a secret?

66
00:08:45,106 --> 00:08:46,792
Of course I can keep a secret.

67
00:08:48,474 --> 00:08:53,502
Yesterday Cheryl told me
she's been faking her orgasms.

68
00:08:55,385 --> 00:08:57,880
She won't tell Brad because
she's afraid he'll break up with her.

69
00:08:58,419 --> 00:09:00,375
So I finally told her what I think she should do.

70
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,623
What should she do?

71
00:09:02,624 --> 00:09:04,642
She should keep faking.

72
00:09:05,134 --> 00:09:08,043
It's a completely legitimate strategy to buy time.

73
00:09:08,044 --> 00:09:09,044
Really?

74
00:09:09,045 --> 00:09:14,020
Cause the thing is, if she tells Brad,
he's gonna think it's all his fault.

75
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:17,031
You know?

76
00:09:17,475 --> 00:09:20,454
And the thing is, an orgasm
isn't something Brad can give her.

77
00:09:21,591 --> 00:09:23,719
She has to claim it for herself.

78
00:09:26,602 --> 00:09:27,945
What do you think?

79
00:09:29,217 --> 00:09:31,615
What do you mean with,
what do I think?

80
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:51,030
Hi.

81
00:09:56,598 --> 00:09:58,360
Jamie and Jamie.

82
00:09:59,152 --> 00:10:01,326
Actually, I just started to call myself James again.

83
00:10:01,631 --> 00:10:03,568
I'm sorry. I keep forgetting.
- It's all right.

84
00:10:04,847 --> 00:10:06,995
Jamie and James.

85
00:10:06,996 --> 00:10:09,228
Tell me about yourselves.

86
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,832
Well, I'm Jamie Mitchell.

87
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:16,509
I was a child actor. I was on a
TV show called "One of the family".

88
00:10:18,244 --> 00:10:21,914
Where the rich black couple
adopted the poor white trash kid,

89
00:10:21,949 --> 00:10:24,925
and they didn't have the heart
to tell him he's not black?

90
00:10:24,973 --> 00:10:27,021
"I'm an albino!"

91
00:10:27,056 --> 00:10:29,072
I'm Canadian.

92
00:10:30,275 --> 00:10:32,999
Well, Jamie and I met
when I was doing research

93
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,444
for "Take him from the streets".
I paid a street hustler.

94
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:40,323
And -- James was -- well, he was --

95
00:10:40,324 --> 00:10:42,375
escorting at the time.

96
00:10:43,475 --> 00:10:45,031
James, what do you do now?

97
00:10:45,032 --> 00:10:46,861
Well, I don't hustle any more.

98
00:10:46,862 --> 00:10:48,386
Um, I guess I'm a...

99
00:10:48,387 --> 00:10:49,387
He's a lifeguard.

100
00:10:50,466 --> 00:10:51,466
Yeah, at a...

101
00:10:51,486 --> 00:10:53,386
a gym jacuzzi.

102
00:10:54,518 --> 00:10:55,518
Can you tell me why you're here?

103
00:10:56,939 --> 00:11:00,254
Recently we started about opening up our relationship, you know.

104
00:11:00,255 --> 00:11:01,255
Sexually.

105
00:11:02,396 --> 00:11:07,332
I was a little surprised when Jamie mentioned that he wanted to do this,

106
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:10,346
and then I thought, well, we've been together five years,

107
00:11:10,347 --> 00:11:11,347
and -- I mean, let's face it,

108
00:11:12,192 --> 00:11:14,091
monogamy's for straight people.

109
00:11:14,092 --> 00:11:18,159
But we thought we should get an impartial opinion from a sex therapist.

110
00:11:19,974 --> 00:11:20,974
Dr Lin?

111
00:11:22,696 --> 00:11:24,915
Actually I prefer the term "couples counselor".

112
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:27,972
Although I have a great deal of experience in sex therapy.

113
00:11:27,973 --> 00:11:31,342
Jamie, I'm wondering --
can you do me a big favor?

114
00:11:31,343 --> 00:11:32,343
Sure.

115
00:11:32,344 --> 00:11:33,344
Leave us alone.

116
00:11:36,511 --> 00:11:37,511
'K...

117
00:11:40,435 --> 00:11:41,306
Thanks.

118
00:11:41,341 --> 00:11:42,177
All right.

119
00:11:45,911 --> 00:11:47,915
Why are you here?

120
00:11:50,644 --> 00:11:53,549
Well, something did happen at work last week.

121
00:11:55,661 --> 00:11:59,448
Um, would you mind if I taped myself talking about this?

122
00:12:00,288 --> 00:12:04,912
See, I'm making this little film, and
I want to tape myself telling this story.

123
00:12:04,947 --> 00:12:05,724
Just me.

124
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:06,725
Sure, OK.

125
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:15,018
So I was at the gym last week...

126
00:12:44,441 --> 00:12:45,441
Oh, Jesus!

127
00:12:45,442 --> 00:12:48,051
There's something in there!
Something's on the bottom there!

128
00:12:54,633 --> 00:12:56,353
Can you help me?

129
00:13:36,594 --> 00:13:38,190
What was that?

130
00:13:38,191 --> 00:13:40,051
It must have been a brownout.

131
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:41,052
Are you OK?

132
00:13:41,053 --> 00:13:42,053
Yeah, yeah.

133
00:13:42,054 --> 00:13:43,054
Everything's fine.

134
00:13:43,171 --> 00:13:45,736
You know, we're making some progress.

135
00:13:46,984 --> 00:13:51,001
I got to hear from James,
and now I'd love to hear from you, Jamie.

136
00:13:54,048 --> 00:13:57,105
Tell me what you need in your life right now.

137
00:13:58,179 --> 00:13:59,655
Well, I need Jamie.

138
00:14:00,205 --> 00:14:01,205
Besides James.

139
00:14:03,066 --> 00:14:05,728
We love each other so much.

140
00:14:07,098 --> 00:14:08,098
I just...

141
00:14:10,525 --> 00:14:12,271
I don't want to lose him.

142
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:16,550
And I think about him and other guys,

143
00:14:16,551 --> 00:14:19,175
and then I think about me and other guys,

144
00:14:19,176 --> 00:14:22,894
and I think, maybe there's an opportunity here.

145
00:14:22,895 --> 00:14:28,312
I mean, there's a lot of good and cute people in the world who don't have any love in their lives,

146
00:14:28,313 --> 00:14:31,296
and I think we could help them.
I mean, I love cute people.

147
00:14:31,297 --> 00:14:33,597
Tell me what you need, in one sentence.

148
00:14:33,807 --> 00:14:34,807
I love everybody.

149
00:14:34,808 --> 00:14:36,804
That's not a need.

150
00:14:36,805 --> 00:14:39,919
I need to love everybody.

151
00:14:43,713 --> 00:14:45,552
Wait! Did you just hear me?

152
00:14:45,943 --> 00:14:47,714
"I need to love everybody"?

153
00:14:47,715 --> 00:14:50,251
How can I love everybody?
I can't even meet everybody!

154
00:14:50,252 --> 00:14:52,154
Wow! You're good!

155
00:14:52,155 --> 00:14:53,155
Thank you!
- Jamie...

156
00:14:54,192 --> 00:14:55,567
Thank you!
I'm having a breakthrough!

157
00:14:55,568 --> 00:14:58,085
Jamie, that's actually called a "false epiphany".

158
00:14:58,086 --> 00:15:00,254
Come on, give me a break!
Did you give him a breakthrough?

159
00:15:00,692 --> 00:15:02,224
You don't just dole out the breakthroughs.

160
00:15:02,225 --> 00:15:03,225
Well, you can!

161
00:15:03,226 --> 00:15:04,226
Don't you give yourself a breakthrough?

162
00:15:04,869 --> 00:15:05,869
I don't need a breakthrough.

163
00:15:05,979 --> 00:15:06,979
You're not gonna give me the breakthrough?

164
00:15:07,047 --> 00:15:08,047
I do not need a breakthrough.

165
00:15:08,425 --> 00:15:09,425
We all need breakthroughs.

166
00:15:09,546 --> 00:15:10,447
Well shut up and sit down!

167
00:15:10,482 --> 00:15:11,482
You shut up! And I...

168
00:15:11,517 --> 00:15:12,317
Sit down!

169
00:15:14,033 --> 00:15:16,307
Oh my God. I...

170
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,613
I am so sorry.

171
00:15:19,444 --> 00:15:21,770
I'm not gonna charge you for this session.

172
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:25,900
It's a...

173
00:15:30,093 --> 00:15:32,231
I'm preorgasmic.

174
00:15:34,727 --> 00:15:37,901
Does that mean you're about to have one?

175
00:15:37,902 --> 00:15:38,902
No.

176
00:15:40,296 --> 00:15:42,323
I've never had one.

177
00:18:06,433 --> 00:18:07,335
Get the hell out of here.

178
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:07,939
Everybody hates you.

179
00:18:07,974 --> 00:18:08,543
Do you know who I am?

180
00:18:09,311 --> 00:18:10,122
Yes, I know who you are.

181
00:18:10,508 --> 00:18:11,317
Dr Donuts.

182
00:18:11,688 --> 00:18:12,540
Eat my twat, Dr Donuts!

183
00:18:12,837 --> 00:18:13,695
Fuck you!

184
00:18:14,115 --> 00:18:16,464
I hate carbs!

185
00:18:17,368 --> 00:18:18,323
What are you looking at?

186
00:18:18,386 --> 00:18:19,412
Nothing. Um--

187
00:18:19,683 --> 00:18:21,813
Jamie and, um, James told me to come here.

188
00:18:22,566 --> 00:18:24,042
What's your name?

189
00:18:24,043 --> 00:18:25,043
Sophia.

190
00:18:25,044 --> 00:18:28,472
Oh, Sophia! I'm Justin Bond.
I'm the mistress of Shortbus.

191
00:18:28,473 --> 00:18:29,473
Come on.

192
00:18:36,037 --> 00:18:37,467
Do you know what a shortbus is?

193
00:18:37,802 --> 00:18:38,275
No.

194
00:18:38,276 --> 00:18:40,414
You've heard of the Big Yellow School Bus?

195
00:18:40,873 --> 00:18:42,303
Well, this is the short one.

196
00:18:42,338 --> 00:18:45,021
It's a salon for the gifted and challenged.

197
00:18:45,978 --> 00:18:46,978
Hi-ha!

198
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:50,365
That's Alice. She's got a cunt like a wizard's sleeve.

199
00:18:51,331 --> 00:18:52,331
This place has really taken off in the last few years,

200
00:18:52,332 --> 00:18:55,135
since all these young people started flocking to the city.

201
00:18:55,351 --> 00:18:57,618
Why would they come to New York?
It's so expensive to live here.

202
00:18:57,619 --> 00:18:58,619
9-11.

203
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:01,117
It's the only thing real that's ever happened to them.

204
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:04,125
Now in here is our performance room.

205
00:19:04,126 --> 00:19:06,397
But tonight we're having a film festival.

206
00:19:06,398 --> 00:19:09,326
They're boring as hell, but I've found the more boring they are,

207
00:19:09,361 --> 00:19:12,778
the more intelligent people think they are. But watch.

208
00:19:17,665 --> 00:19:19,101
"I'm an albino!"

209
00:19:20,212 --> 00:19:22,553
Oh, there's the Jamies.

210
00:19:24,856 --> 00:19:25,856
Hey. Mmm. Good to see you.

211
00:19:25,857 --> 00:19:26,857
Hi James.
- Hey.

212
00:19:29,185 --> 00:19:30,856
I'm so glad you came.

213
00:19:31,346 --> 00:19:35,117
I said to switch the films. We're gonna do
a three-hour Gertrude Stein documentary.

214
00:19:35,118 --> 00:19:36,975
That sounds like a real weenie shrinker.

215
00:19:36,976 --> 00:19:38,475
Come on, let's go get laid.

216
00:19:38,476 --> 00:19:39,476
You're gonna be all right?

217
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:39,986
Yeah.

218
00:19:42,054 --> 00:19:43,054
What's the matter?

219
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,500
Nothing.

220
00:19:45,632 --> 00:19:48,782
Are you sure you wanna try this tonight?

221
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,425
No, that's too late.
It'll be good for us.

222
00:19:52,114 --> 00:19:53,203
Are you OK with it?

223
00:19:53,665 --> 00:19:53,854
Yeah...

224
00:19:57,222 --> 00:20:01,664
If you find somebody and I don't,
you know, that's totally cool.

225
00:20:02,089 --> 00:20:05,662
But if I find somebody and you don't,
that's a dealbreaker for me. I can't do that.

226
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:06,663
No, don't do that.

227
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:11,233
I spend half of my time blowing the NYPD to keep this place open.

228
00:20:11,268 --> 00:20:13,125
I barely have any time for myself.

229
00:20:13,661 --> 00:20:17,385
Here's the sex *** room.
This is where it all happens.

230
00:20:17,386 --> 00:20:19,340
Aren't they beautiful?

231
00:20:30,155 --> 00:20:34,704
It's not your average sort of Friday night event,
but people seem to be enjoying themselves.

232
00:20:34,705 --> 00:20:37,324
Last week we had some people in here,
I had to throw them out,

233
00:20:37,325 --> 00:20:39,153
'cause you know, this is my house...

234
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:25,923
Oh, this is Creamy.
She's your maître d'.

235
00:21:25,924 --> 00:21:28,197
Pleased to meet you.
Can I help you with some condoms or lube?

236
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:29,770
No, I'm fine, thank you.

237
00:21:29,805 --> 00:21:32,242
Well, then maybe some blondies.
These are cannabis-free,

238
00:21:32,243 --> 00:21:33,243
the pot corn isn't.

239
00:21:33,244 --> 00:21:34,244
Excuse me.

240
00:21:34,245 --> 00:21:35,245
Pot corn.

241
00:21:35,246 --> 00:21:37,684
These are actually not all for me.
Thank you so, so much.

242
00:21:37,685 --> 00:21:39,622
Why don't you come in and have a look?

243
00:21:39,657 --> 00:21:43,181
After all, voyeurism is participation.

244
00:21:46,354 --> 00:21:48,086
Well?

245
00:21:48,087 --> 00:21:50,375
Now come on.

246
00:21:51,348 --> 00:21:54,023
These bitches in there. Eating asses and sucking cock,

247
00:21:54,024 --> 00:21:57,072
and then they show up at the buffet and say they're vegan.

248
00:21:57,088 --> 00:21:58,088
Hi.

249
00:21:58,941 --> 00:21:59,941
Any bites?

250
00:22:00,604 --> 00:22:01,604
No.

251
00:22:01,605 --> 00:22:02,605
I love these little gadgets.

252
00:22:02,782 --> 00:22:04,582
Oh, this is Sophia.
She's a friend of the Jamies.

253
00:22:04,583 --> 00:22:05,583
You know the Jamies?

254
00:22:05,584 --> 00:22:08,229
I love the Jamies!
They're like the cutest couple in the whole world.

255
00:22:08,374 --> 00:22:09,817
Do you think you could introduce me to them?

256
00:22:09,852 --> 00:22:10,375
Yeah, probably.

257
00:22:11,317 --> 00:22:13,127
I'm Ceth, with a C.
- Justin...

258
00:22:13,128 --> 00:22:16,772
Hmm?
- Someone just came on your cat.

259
00:22:16,807 --> 00:22:18,116
It's not funny!

260
00:22:19,689 --> 00:22:20,689
Why can't they leave my pussy alone?

261
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:22,079
What is that?

262
00:22:22,114 --> 00:22:25,385
That's the "yenta 650".
It's supposed to find me a husband.

263
00:22:25,386 --> 00:22:26,386
How does it work?

264
00:22:26,387 --> 00:22:27,387
I put in my profile...

265
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,720
"I got a match for you!"

266
00:22:31,377 --> 00:22:35,964
Hi.
- I'm Magnus. And you are Keth?

267
00:22:37,184 --> 00:22:41,520
That's actually Ceth. So you're 1.9 meters tall?
What's that in feet and inches?

268
00:22:42,592 --> 00:22:44,756
Do you know?
Where are you from?

269
00:22:44,791 --> 00:22:46,866
Canada.   - Oh really?
- 6 1/2 feet.

270
00:22:47,742 --> 00:22:50,286
6 1/2. So that makes...
a 15 cm dick...

271
00:22:50,298 --> 00:22:51,198
Oh my God!

272
00:22:51,213 --> 00:22:53,590
Maybe we can talk about this if we sit?

273
00:22:53,591 --> 00:22:55,851
Yeah, I'll be right there.
- Great.

274
00:22:55,852 --> 00:22:56,872
Is my hair OK?

275
00:22:57,073 --> 00:22:58,773
Yeah, it's fine.

276
00:23:01,529 --> 00:23:02,529
Thanks.

277
00:23:03,826 --> 00:23:05,307
Sophia, come sit with us.

278
00:23:05,308 --> 00:23:06,308
OK.

279
00:23:08,655 --> 00:23:11,137
You make it sound like the Loch Ness monster.

280
00:23:11,172 --> 00:23:14,191
It doesn't seem like it should be so hard to find.

281
00:23:14,192 --> 00:23:18,387
It is so elusive, you know.
I'm starting to wonder if it's even natural.

282
00:23:18,388 --> 00:23:20,787
It's not necessary for procreation, is it?

283
00:23:20,788 --> 00:23:22,802
It only seems to appear in a handful of species

284
00:23:22,837 --> 00:23:27,256
like the rabbit, the ferret,
the bottle-nosed dolphin, the macaque, the bonobo,...

285
00:23:27,257 --> 00:23:30,417
"I'm an albino!"

286
00:23:30,418 --> 00:23:31,418
Thanks.

287
00:23:31,419 --> 00:23:34,766
Well I am, so it meant a lot to me.

288
00:23:34,767 --> 00:23:35,767
Oh, that means a lot to <i>me</i>, actually.

289
00:23:37,132 --> 00:23:38,132
Hey.

290
00:23:39,274 --> 00:23:40,274
Hey.

291
00:23:40,275 --> 00:23:41,623
You gonna be around later?

292
00:23:41,631 --> 00:23:42,531
Sure.

293
00:23:45,385 --> 00:23:46,527
Sorry. Go on.

294
00:23:46,528 --> 00:23:48,326
You know, I feel like we're inundated by images

295
00:23:48,361 --> 00:23:51,938
of these super deluxe babes in the throes of the ultimate orgasm...

296
00:23:51,973 --> 00:23:54,863
I think it's just some myth to sell more magazines.

297
00:23:55,854 --> 00:24:00,030
Whoa, myth? Did you just say that
female orgasms are a myth?

298
00:24:00,031 --> 00:24:01,031
Yeah.

299
00:24:01,032 --> 00:24:04,557
I'm here to tell you, sister, they're not.
- Here we go.

300
00:24:04,592 --> 00:24:06,480
I've seen them happen before.
They're completely real.

301
00:24:06,969 --> 00:24:08,959
Shabbos, Sophia.
Sophia, Shabbos.

302
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,960
Hey kids.

303
00:24:10,587 --> 00:24:12,556
Nice to meet you.
I'm Shabbos Goy,

304
00:24:12,557 --> 00:24:15,093
and if you're Jewish
I can help you turn on your lights.

305
00:24:17,105 --> 00:24:18,332
I'm agnostic.

306
00:24:18,367 --> 00:24:19,254
Do you like performance art?

307
00:24:19,658 --> 00:24:20,344
Yeah, I do.

308
00:24:20,379 --> 00:24:22,634
OK, I'm gonna do a show soon, and I think that you should come to it.

309
00:24:22,635 --> 00:24:24,912
Might be a sort of therapeutic for your little problem.

310
00:24:24,947 --> 00:24:25,612
Excuse me?

311
00:24:25,613 --> 00:24:29,653
I have to say I find the fact that you can't have an orgasm completely unacceptable.

312
00:24:29,654 --> 00:24:31,078
I would really like to work with you.

313
00:24:31,079 --> 00:24:31,590
Shabbos!

314
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,249
Maybe I can help her!

315
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:35,274
You know, I'm sort of like a orgasmic superhero.

316
00:24:35,531 --> 00:24:42,000
"Have I got a match for you? Oy, **! Oy, sheyne ponim! Sheyne ponim at 11 o'clock! Come on, just get off and go! Why so picky?"

317
00:24:43,081 --> 00:24:44,612
Shit!

318
00:24:44,613 --> 00:24:47,061
Sir, I'm so sorry. Are you OK?

319
00:24:47,096 --> 00:24:51,027
My pacemaker. This odd vibration.

320
00:24:51,174 --> 00:24:52,651
I'm so sorry.

321
00:24:52,652 --> 00:24:53,652
No, no...

322
00:24:53,653 --> 00:24:55,534
I think that was my Yenta.

323
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:56,535
Your-- your who?

324
00:24:59,452 --> 00:25:02,124
Don't I know you from somewhere?

325
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:04,356
Well...

326
00:25:04,391 --> 00:25:08,699
I used to be the mayor of New York.

327
00:25:11,061 --> 00:25:12,724
Oh my God.

328
00:25:12,725 --> 00:25:14,590
It's called "Ode to the female secretion",

329
00:25:14,625 --> 00:25:16,719
and it works in five different movements:

330
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,452
Lubrication, Lactation,

331
00:25:19,453 --> 00:25:21,705
Ejaculation --which is my favorite--,

332
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:22,786
then Urinatinon and Menstruation.

333
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:24,315
I think my throat's closing.

334
00:25:24,503 --> 00:25:25,452
I can't use the last two.

335
00:25:25,453 --> 00:25:26,758
Are you a really heavy bleeder?

336
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:28,499
On my second and third days.

337
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,500
That's so hot.

338
00:25:31,109 --> 00:25:33,730
You know, I use menstrual blood as makeup in my show.

339
00:25:33,983 --> 00:25:37,984
Tampons. Just pull them right out, fresh from the fruit, and use it as lipstick.

340
00:25:37,985 --> 00:25:38,985
It's a period piece.

341
00:25:39,775 --> 00:25:41,186
You're kidding.

342
00:25:41,523 --> 00:25:44,477
I should really use that in the show. 
That's the first funny thing you've ever said in your life.

343
00:25:44,478 --> 00:25:46,436
Would you be interested in doing that?

344
00:25:46,437 --> 00:25:47,437
You mean, donating... my...

345
00:25:47,438 --> 00:25:50,101
Some of your menstrual blood for my face.

346
00:25:50,102 --> 00:25:51,102
Oh, come on now!

347
00:25:51,103 --> 00:25:51,603
What?

348
00:25:51,604 --> 00:25:53,104
Join the line!

349
00:25:54,083 --> 00:25:56,437
Did that make you... 
I think it just made you uncomfortable

350
00:25:56,438 --> 00:25:57,237
because you're a little baby homo.
- What are you doing?

351
00:25:58,144 --> 00:26:00,110
Does this really have to do with an orgasm?

352
00:26:00,111 --> 00:26:01,111
It comes from her fucking pussy,

353
00:26:01,112 --> 00:26:02,776
why are you so fucking uncomfortable about it?

354
00:26:02,777 --> 00:26:03,777
I can deal with pussies!

355
00:26:03,778 --> 00:26:05,221
I'm around them all the time!

356
00:26:05,222 --> 00:26:07,148
I'm not talking about your fucking boyfriend.

357
00:26:08,704 --> 00:26:09,704
Get off of me!

358
00:26:10,719 --> 00:26:11,719
You got a boner!

359
00:26:12,033 --> 00:26:13,585
That's my cellphone, you fucking albino butch faggot!

360
00:26:14,969 --> 00:26:16,960
Want to fuck me there with your mangina?

361
00:26:17,349 --> 00:26:20,171
*** just for cockfucking me, you fucking dick.

362
00:26:27,089 --> 00:26:28,089
Hi.

363
00:26:29,104 --> 00:26:30,511
Are you OK?

364
00:26:32,203 --> 00:26:33,403
There's just, uh... 

365
00:26:33,404 --> 00:26:34,914
lots of, uh...

366
00:26:34,949 --> 00:26:36,983
Men?

367
00:26:36,984 --> 00:26:37,984
Yes.
- Jesus.

368
00:26:37,985 --> 00:26:38,985
My name is Bitch.

369
00:26:39,995 --> 00:26:40,912
Hi Bitch.

370
00:26:40,971 --> 00:26:41,960
You are?

371
00:26:41,961 --> 00:26:42,961
Sophia.

372
00:26:43,354 --> 00:26:44,740
Hey, sister. Sit down.

373
00:26:44,741 --> 00:26:46,917
You're in the right place.

374
00:26:46,918 --> 00:26:47,918
You're in the Pussy Palace.

375
00:26:49,579 --> 00:26:52,266
So you're a sex therapist
but you've never had an orgasm?

376
00:26:52,267 --> 00:26:54,735
Actually I prefer the term "couples counselor".

377
00:26:54,736 --> 00:26:55,736
Have you ever been with a woman?

378
00:26:56,761 --> 00:27:00,171
Uh, no, you know--
I'm not sure if I'm wired that way.

379
00:27:00,172 --> 00:27:02,759
Rob's the only person I've ever been with.

380
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:03,760
Wow.
- It's cool.

381
00:27:03,761 --> 00:27:04,761
My god.

382
00:27:04,887 --> 00:27:07,336
You must have some major blue clit.

383
00:27:08,871 --> 00:27:10,502
Did you do those PC muscle exercises?

384
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,455
You know, the PC muscle that controls your pee?

385
00:27:12,456 --> 00:27:14,620
So when you're peeing next time, 
just, you know,

386
00:27:14,655 --> 00:27:18,416
squeeze it up and then let it go. 
Squeeze it up, let it go.

387
00:27:18,417 --> 00:27:19,417
That's good for your orgasms.

388
00:27:19,418 --> 00:27:21,725
I'm doing it right now.

389
00:27:21,726 --> 00:27:22,726
Can you guys tell from my face?

390
00:27:23,295 --> 00:27:24,691
May I ask you a question?

391
00:27:24,785 --> 00:27:30,156
I wanna know what did your very orgasm feel like.

392
00:27:32,624 --> 00:27:34,033
Welcome to Lifetime Television.

393
00:27:34,068 --> 00:27:35,658
It's all about your pussies.

394
00:27:35,693 --> 00:27:41,473
This is gonna sound really cheesy, but 
I felt like I was shooting out creative energy into the world,

395
00:27:41,474 --> 00:27:49,578
and it was merging with other people's energy, 
and then there was no was. There was peace.

396
00:27:49,579 --> 00:27:50,579
Wow.

397
00:27:52,428 --> 00:27:55,150
Well, mine was definitely with Little Prince.

398
00:27:55,151 --> 00:27:57,473
We had this incredible connection.

399
00:27:57,474 --> 00:28:01,026
We just like made it really slow and still,

400
00:28:01,061 --> 00:28:04,563
and I felt like I was finally not alone.

401
00:28:08,362 --> 00:28:12,017
Mine felt like I was talking with the gods or something. 
You know, they were--

402
00:28:12,052 --> 00:28:13,605
Shut the fuck up.

403
00:28:13,902 --> 00:28:14,984
Excuse me?

404
00:28:14,985 --> 00:28:17,530
Sophia, if you've never had an orgasm,

405
00:28:17,565 --> 00:28:20,857
then how does it feel like 
for you to have sex?

406
00:28:21,859 --> 00:28:22,859
Great.

407
00:28:25,599 --> 00:28:27,337
Yeah. Sex is really awesome.

408
00:28:27,338 --> 00:28:28,338
I love sex.

409
00:28:31,396 --> 00:28:33,610
Sex feels terrific.
- That's great.

410
00:28:34,844 --> 00:28:36,349
I love it. A lot.

411
00:28:36,384 --> 00:28:39,003
It's a great workout. 
It feels good.

412
00:28:39,038 --> 00:28:40,887
And I love loving my husband.

413
00:28:40,922 --> 00:28:45,100
It's just, there comes a point sometimes where it gets a lot of pressure

414
00:28:45,729 --> 00:28:47,948
and kinda like,

415
00:28:47,949 --> 00:28:48,949
it feels a little bit, 
kinda like, um,

416
00:28:50,682 --> 00:28:52,261
like somebody's gonna kill me,

417
00:28:52,296 --> 00:28:56,235
and I just have to smile 
and pretend to enjoy it.

418
00:28:57,548 --> 00:28:59,686
And that way I can survive.

419
00:29:05,396 --> 00:29:06,865
Fuck, Severin.

420
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:09,594
Excuse me, that was totally inappropriate.

421
00:29:09,862 --> 00:29:12,787
Don't mind her.
- Freak.

422
00:29:38,059 --> 00:29:40,633
But you know what's the most wonderful thing about New York?

423
00:29:40,634 --> 00:29:41,634
What?

424
00:29:41,635 --> 00:29:43,420
It's where everyone comes to get fucked.

425
00:29:45,749 --> 00:29:48,550
It's one of the last places where people are still willing to bend over

426
00:29:48,585 --> 00:29:50,775
to let in the new.

427
00:29:53,828 --> 00:29:55,546
And the old.

428
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:10,903
New Yorkers are... permeable.

429
00:30:10,904 --> 00:30:11,822
You know what I mean?

430
00:30:11,847 --> 00:30:13,132
Yeah.

431
00:30:13,148 --> 00:30:14,530
You sure are?

432
00:30:16,265 --> 00:30:18,508
Therefore we're sane.

433
00:30:18,509 --> 00:30:27,520
Consequently, we're the target of the impermeable. 
And the insane.

434
00:30:30,277 --> 00:30:37,231
And of course, New York is where everyone comes to be forgiven.

435
00:30:40,417 --> 00:30:42,959
What have you done wrong?

436
00:30:51,687 --> 00:30:54,649
Tell me, how have you sinned?

437
00:30:57,875 --> 00:30:59,932
I'm sure it's nothing serious.

438
00:30:59,933 --> 00:31:00,933
How would you know?

439
00:31:00,934 --> 00:31:06,522
Well, I'm-- I'm sure you did your best.

440
00:31:08,092 --> 00:31:13,214
Imagine if you grew up here like I did.

441
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:22,460
Home can be very unforgiving.

442
00:31:25,523 --> 00:31:27,225
It's true.

443
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:32,441
People said I didn't do enough

444
00:31:32,442 --> 00:31:35,908
to help prevent the AIDS crisis

445
00:31:35,909 --> 00:31:39,928
because I was in the closet.

446
00:31:42,654 --> 00:31:44,356
That's not true.

447
00:31:44,391 --> 00:31:47,835
I did the best I could.

448
00:31:49,562 --> 00:31:50,562
I was--

449
00:31:52,688 --> 00:31:54,198
I was scared

450
00:31:56,479 --> 00:31:58,592
and--

451
00:31:59,929 --> 00:32:00,929
impermeable.

452
00:32:03,938 --> 00:32:06,903
Everybody knew so little then.

453
00:32:11,491 --> 00:32:17,075
I know even less now.

454
00:34:02,364 --> 00:34:03,364
Chip?

455
00:34:12,302 --> 00:34:13,302
No, I'm OK.

456
00:34:19,479 --> 00:34:20,479
Who's that?

457
00:34:21,964 --> 00:34:23,627
If he's wearing a blue shirt, it's me.

458
00:34:24,952 --> 00:34:25,952
It's you.

459
00:34:27,166 --> 00:34:28,253
I made that for him.

460
00:34:28,288 --> 00:34:29,697
Oh yeah?

461
00:34:29,698 --> 00:34:31,772
That's Jamie there on the back.

462
00:34:31,807 --> 00:34:33,373
Oh my God.

463
00:34:33,408 --> 00:34:35,393
Shut up, that's so cute!

464
00:34:36,930 --> 00:34:38,868
How old are you guys?

465
00:34:38,869 --> 00:34:39,869
Seven.

466
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:40,870
Six.

467
00:34:42,769 --> 00:34:44,231
Somewhere around there.

468
00:34:49,715 --> 00:34:52,031
I think I'm actually gonna go.

469
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:54,150
What? No!

470
00:34:54,151 --> 00:34:55,151
Yeah.

471
00:34:55,152 --> 00:34:56,152
No, it's OK. It's cool.

472
00:34:56,153 --> 00:34:57,153
Are you sure?

473
00:34:57,154 --> 00:34:58,154
No.

474
00:34:58,155 --> 00:35:00,156
Yeah.

475
00:35:01,885 --> 00:35:03,538
Hang out for a while.

476
00:35:03,539 --> 00:35:04,539
OK.

477
00:35:04,896 --> 00:35:06,320
Come on.

478
00:35:32,729 --> 00:35:34,980
How do I be a model?

479
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:38,458
A lot of it's instinct, to be honest. 

480
00:35:38,493 --> 00:35:40,347
But there are some basics.

481
00:35:40,348 --> 00:35:42,801
The way I like to think about it, it's like geometry.

482
00:35:42,836 --> 00:35:44,848
Like lines and angles.

483
00:36:04,090 --> 00:36:05,090
I like that.

484
00:36:07,971 --> 00:36:09,555
That's perfect. That's like an ad right there.

485
00:36:11,626 --> 00:36:12,626
See, you got it.

486
00:36:14,227 --> 00:36:16,382
Whatever, I hate it. It totally sucks.

487
00:36:32,965 --> 00:36:33,965
James?

488
00:36:33,966 --> 00:36:34,966
Yeah?

489
00:36:35,805 --> 00:36:37,429
Can you actually use your other hand?

490
00:36:37,464 --> 00:36:40,454
'Cause I usually command it from a different angle.

491
00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:41,654
Sure.

492
00:36:44,402 --> 00:36:45,349
How's that?

493
00:36:45,384 --> 00:36:46,296
That's fine.

494
00:36:55,112 --> 00:36:56,392
That feels really good.

495
00:36:57,388 --> 00:36:58,262
What?

496
00:36:58,263 --> 00:36:58,870
Huh?

497
00:37:00,628 --> 00:37:02,150
Just say something.
- What are you talking...

498
00:37:02,499 --> 00:37:04,114
Make more sounds.

499
00:37:04,721 --> 00:37:05,814
"I'm an albino!"

500
00:37:07,018 --> 00:37:08,018
"I'm an albino!"

501
00:37:09,567 --> 00:37:10,567
"I'm an albino!"

502
00:37:12,099 --> 00:37:16,669
"O say, can you see"

503
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:22,723
"by the dawn’s early li-i-i-i-i-ight"

504
00:37:22,724 --> 00:37:33,788
"O say, does that
star-spangled banner yet wave"

505
00:37:33,789 --> 00:37:43,438
"O’er the land of the free-e-e-e-eee"

506
00:37:43,439 --> 00:37:52,694
"and the home of the b-rave?"

507
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:58,044
Is that the first time somebody sang the National Anthem in your ass?

508
00:37:58,045 --> 00:37:59,045
No.

509
00:38:30,505 --> 00:38:32,609
OK, rotate.

510
00:38:36,812 --> 00:38:39,205
Carpet burn.

511
00:38:52,236 --> 00:38:54,531
Jamie, can I watch you fuck him?

512
00:40:46,054 --> 00:40:47,848
I want you.

513
00:40:50,936 --> 00:40:52,991
You. You. You.

514
00:41:36,343 --> 00:41:39,058
That's it.

515
00:41:39,059 --> 00:41:41,110
Fuck...

516
00:42:02,917 --> 00:42:05,119
Fuck!

517
00:42:13,869 --> 00:42:14,644
Rob!

518
00:42:14,645 --> 00:42:15,609
What?

519
00:42:15,644 --> 00:42:16,577
It's too loud!

520
00:42:17,024 --> 00:42:18,031
No, it's not.

521
00:42:18,066 --> 00:42:18,542
It is!

522
00:42:18,543 --> 00:42:19,184
It's not!

523
00:42:19,185 --> 00:42:19,948
It is!

524
00:42:19,949 --> 00:42:20,329
It's not too loud!

525
00:42:20,350 --> 00:42:21,306
I can't concentrate!

526
00:42:21,307 --> 00:42:22,209
I'm looking for a job, OK?

527
00:42:22,210 --> 00:42:23,210
What kind of a job, a hand job?

528
00:42:24,664 --> 00:42:26,596
For Christ's sake, turn the fucking music off!

529
00:42:26,876 --> 00:42:27,994
And look at this place.

530
00:42:27,995 --> 00:42:30,925
I just got the fucking cleaners in here yesterday!

531
00:42:30,926 --> 00:42:32,416
These are my dried cranberries--

532
00:42:32,451 --> 00:42:34,047
And you bought everything in this house!

533
00:42:37,275 --> 00:42:38,538
Fuck - you!

534
00:42:41,126 --> 00:42:45,091
We agreed to come from a place of love.

535
00:42:52,489 --> 00:42:55,583
I feel your warm and loving hands.

536
00:42:57,657 --> 00:42:59,892
And I feel worried that you think I'm ugly.

537
00:43:01,611 --> 00:43:03,997
Because why else would you be doing that on the computer.

538
00:43:04,465 --> 00:43:06,873
I'm squeezing your perfectly round shoulders,

539
00:43:06,874 --> 00:43:09,892
following to your clavicle and your collarbone,

540
00:43:09,893 --> 00:43:12,273
so you know that you're incredibly attractive.

541
00:43:12,308 --> 00:43:13,151
I think you're incredibly sexy.

542
00:43:14,103 --> 00:43:16,356
And I'm just distracting myself.

543
00:43:17,167 --> 00:43:20,215
I feel the sleeves of your T-shirt.

544
00:43:20,250 --> 00:43:22,283
They're dry against my clammy hands.

545
00:43:22,284 --> 00:43:23,427
Your skin is perfect

546
00:43:23,462 --> 00:43:25,231
like I could never get this on a computer.

547
00:43:25,232 --> 00:43:26,860
'Cause I'm just-- blocked.

548
00:43:26,895 --> 00:43:29,025
Totally. We're both blocked, and--

549
00:43:29,336 --> 00:43:30,480
Oh god, that feels good.

550
00:43:30,481 --> 00:43:31,727
Really?

551
00:43:31,762 --> 00:43:34,026
Shit, I'm so crunchy up there.

552
00:43:35,509 --> 00:43:37,668
How about you unblock these beautiful breasts?

553
00:43:37,703 --> 00:43:39,070
Your pertinent nipples.

554
00:43:39,071 --> 00:43:40,071
"Pertinent"?

555
00:43:40,072 --> 00:43:41,503
Very relevant.

556
00:43:41,538 --> 00:43:42,898
Aw! Jeez!

557
00:43:42,933 --> 00:43:44,705
I am not a cow!

558
00:43:44,873 --> 00:43:46,813
I know you're not a cow, baby--

559
00:43:46,814 --> 00:43:47,814
It felt that way.

560
00:43:47,815 --> 00:43:49,540
It felt like I was a cow.

561
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:51,628
You wanna know why?
- That's what you felt.
- Yes. I own that.

562
00:43:53,965 --> 00:43:55,198
Can we try it again?

563
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:57,903
I'm feeling your strong biceps.

564
00:43:57,904 --> 00:44:02,091
They're so tender and smooth.

565
00:44:02,092 --> 00:44:04,509
Oh god, when you flex them,

566
00:44:04,544 --> 00:44:06,013
they're just like breasts.

567
00:44:07,088 --> 00:44:10,581
I feel the delicate wisps of your receding hairline...

568
00:44:10,644 --> 00:44:11,823
I'm not balding.

569
00:44:11,824 --> 00:44:14,147
Yes you are, honey. You are.

570
00:44:14,182 --> 00:44:17,961
And I love your balding, virile head.

571
00:44:19,002 --> 00:44:20,403
I feel really small.

572
00:44:20,404 --> 00:44:21,895
That's because we are small.

573
00:44:21,896 --> 00:44:23,753
We're so very small.

574
00:44:23,754 --> 00:44:24,754
No!

575
00:44:26,037 --> 00:44:28,910
I'm saying that I feel small.

576
00:44:29,890 --> 00:44:31,882
I feel like I can't take up enough space.

577
00:44:33,042 --> 00:44:35,462
I feel like my cock isn't big enough for you.

578
00:44:35,463 --> 00:44:37,813
This is your issue, and you have to own it.

579
00:44:37,814 --> 00:44:39,205
Because I am not a size queen, 
and I don't care about...

580
00:44:39,236 --> 00:44:42,067
I can't bring home any money. 
I feel like I'm not contributing.

581
00:44:42,759 --> 00:44:45,123
I love the fact that you deliver Meals on Wheels.

582
00:44:45,158 --> 00:44:47,518
You volunteer. It's beautiful. 
Why would you...

583
00:44:47,519 --> 00:44:50,658
Bullshit. I can't even give you an orgasm.

584
00:44:52,415 --> 00:44:54,358
Yes, you... many times you have.

585
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:55,525
Bullshit!

586
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:57,235
I think we can get over this.

587
00:44:57,270 --> 00:45:00,648
We can work this through. We've been through a lot of stuff together.

588
00:45:00,649 --> 00:45:02,284
I can't give you an orgasm!

589
00:45:15,068 --> 00:45:16,068
Hello?

590
00:45:16,911 --> 00:45:19,436
Hi. Is this Severin?

591
00:45:19,437 --> 00:45:20,437
Yeah.

592
00:45:20,438 --> 00:45:23,836
Hey. It's Sophia.

593
00:45:35,481 --> 00:45:38,455
So, do you like to jerk off?

594
00:45:38,490 --> 00:45:40,250
Of course I do.

595
00:45:42,761 --> 00:45:45,828
What are you doing with the cigarette in here?

596
00:45:45,863 --> 00:45:47,791
Please, put that out!

597
00:45:47,826 --> 00:45:49,349
This is a non-smoking environment.

598
00:45:49,350 --> 00:45:52,259
That's totally absurd. 
We're completely surrounded by water.

599
00:45:52,294 --> 00:45:54,272
It's like a dream smoking environment.

600
00:45:54,273 --> 00:45:55,273
You're gonna kill us in here.

601
00:45:56,354 --> 00:45:57,840
That feels good.

602
00:45:57,875 --> 00:45:59,392
Thank you.

603
00:45:59,427 --> 00:46:01,809
What about your husband, has he ever tried to get you off?

604
00:46:01,810 --> 00:46:02,810
This is not about Rob?

605
00:46:03,223 --> 00:46:06,109
70% of all women have trouble achieving an orgasm.

606
00:46:06,144 --> 00:46:07,702
70% of all men are assholes.

607
00:46:07,703 --> 00:46:08,703
He's not an asshole, he's a great guy.

608
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:11,519
If it wasn't for Rob, I'd still be a bank teller.

609
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:12,520
He totally changed my life around.

610
00:46:12,521 --> 00:46:13,521
He's my best friend.

611
00:46:14,644 --> 00:46:17,857
Why is it so important for you to have an orgasm anyway?

612
00:46:17,858 --> 00:46:20,927
I mean, it feels good, but it's not gonna save your life.

613
00:46:20,928 --> 00:46:23,040
I wanna be welcomed into the secret society of women.

614
00:46:23,041 --> 00:46:25,664
I was never a brownie. 
I haven't had an orgasm.

615
00:46:25,665 --> 00:46:27,813
God, I want to be able to save my marriage.

616
00:46:27,848 --> 00:46:29,536
What does it have to do with your marriage?

617
00:46:29,537 --> 00:46:31,640
It has a lot to do with--
- I think it has nothing to do with the other person.

618
00:46:31,675 --> 00:46:33,523
Like, I can only come if it's my own hand.

619
00:46:33,524 --> 00:46:38,426
It has everything to do, because 
you need two people to make love.

620
00:46:38,427 --> 00:46:39,921
No you don't.

621
00:46:40,450 --> 00:46:42,708
Have you even had a relationship?

622
00:46:48,362 --> 00:46:50,918
So were you like, abused as a child?

623
00:46:52,299 --> 00:46:53,299
No.

624
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:54,300
Were you?

625
00:46:54,301 --> 00:46:55,301
No!

626
00:46:56,270 --> 00:46:58,991
I come from a very traditional Chinese Canadian family.

627
00:46:58,992 --> 00:47:01,402
I love Chinese Canadian food, but what does that have to do with it?

628
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:03,483
Chinese families are very strict.

629
00:47:05,175 --> 00:47:07,235
My mom was a disciplinarian,

630
00:47:08,112 --> 00:47:11,235
and my father... was...

631
00:47:11,270 --> 00:47:13,346
my father was a great guy.

632
00:47:13,381 --> 00:47:15,481
Did he touch you?
- No.

633
00:47:16,692 --> 00:47:18,446
No, he didn't touch me.

634
00:47:18,481 --> 00:47:20,243
He didn't touch anyone, ever.

635
00:47:20,244 --> 00:47:22,684
Oh I see. Like, "My father wasn't there, 

636
00:47:22,719 --> 00:47:24,337
I can't feel anything between the legs."

637
00:47:24,372 --> 00:47:26,402
You are so far behind you think you're first.

638
00:47:28,144 --> 00:47:30,342
God, he was alway there for me.

639
00:47:30,377 --> 00:47:32,939
It's just-- he was always there for me, that was the problem.

640
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:33,940
He was always watching me. 
He was always watching me.

641
00:47:36,001 --> 00:47:38,003
Watching you how?

642
00:47:39,168 --> 00:47:41,436
You want me to say he raped me without touching me?

643
00:47:41,437 --> 00:47:42,437
Well, did he?

644
00:47:44,784 --> 00:47:45,784
Did he?

645
00:47:45,785 --> 00:47:47,797
You don't know what the fuck you're talking about.

646
00:47:47,798 --> 00:47:48,798
I'm sorry.

647
00:47:49,029 --> 00:47:53,421
Domination, black and white-- it's not as simple. 
Relationships are more complex than that?

648
00:47:53,422 --> 00:47:56,520
Are you saying that I can't understand your relationship with your father who "watched you",

649
00:47:56,555 --> 00:48:00,202
because I'm a dominatrix?

650
00:48:00,203 --> 00:48:01,203
Well, yes!

651
00:48:01,204 --> 00:48:03,595
That's really funny, because you're a sex therapist

652
00:48:03,596 --> 00:48:05,783
and you can't have an orgasm.

653
00:48:05,818 --> 00:48:07,418
You should be in... 
Where are you going?

654
00:48:07,453 --> 00:48:10,331
I am not one of your clients who pays to be dominated!

655
00:48:10,332 --> 00:48:12,710
Sophia, this is like the best conversation I've had over years.

656
00:48:12,711 --> 00:48:13,711
Let go of my arm!

657
00:48:14,381 --> 00:48:15,743
I won't grab you.

658
00:48:16,708 --> 00:48:18,223
Please, I'm--
I'm sorry, OK? I just--

659
00:48:19,964 --> 00:48:22,853
Sometimes when I get uncomfortable, I get mean.

660
00:48:22,854 --> 00:48:24,819
You are not gonna keep me keen by treating me mean.

661
00:48:25,344 --> 00:48:27,613
Look, I know I can help you have an orgasm.

662
00:48:27,614 --> 00:48:32,764
And maybe you can help me having a real human interaction with someone?

663
00:48:32,765 --> 00:48:35,332
Maybe we could meet here every week for an hour.

664
00:48:35,333 --> 00:48:36,983
I'm in a crisis.

665
00:48:37,018 --> 00:48:39,584
All right, every night this week, starting tomorrow.

666
00:48:44,527 --> 00:48:46,518
You're sitting all by yourself.

667
00:48:47,598 --> 00:48:50,078
And you look up, and there he is.

668
00:48:50,824 --> 00:48:52,432
With his lunch tray.

669
00:48:52,631 --> 00:48:53,681
What's his name again?

670
00:48:53,682 --> 00:48:55,402
Phil.

671
00:48:55,403 --> 00:48:56,403
Phil Mudd.

672
00:48:58,030 --> 00:48:59,743
Severin's not my real name.

673
00:49:02,437 --> 00:49:04,113
What is your real name?

674
00:49:06,403 --> 00:49:10,786
So Phil Mudd says, "Is anyone sitting here?"

675
00:49:11,443 --> 00:49:14,703
And you say, "No one's ever sat here."

676
00:49:15,487 --> 00:49:17,122
OK, I'm going down.

677
00:49:21,273 --> 00:49:26,123
Feel the thought first. 
<i>Then</i> get on the bus.

678
00:49:26,727 --> 00:49:29,361
Just whisper it to me. 
Whisper it in my ear.

679
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:34,365
I can't do it.

680
00:49:34,366 --> 00:49:35,366
Oh, Phil!

681
00:49:36,977 --> 00:49:39,165
I want you to see his lunch tray.

682
00:49:40,509 --> 00:49:43,252
It's got a carton of homogenized milk.

683
00:49:44,181 --> 00:49:46,523
Pour that all over you.

684
00:49:47,504 --> 00:49:51,114
Look at his Converse. 
He markered them all up.

685
00:49:52,083 --> 00:49:55,358
OK, if you can't say it, 
then just simply write it down.

686
00:49:55,663 --> 00:49:59,883
Feel the thought first. 
<i>Then</i> get on the bus.

687
00:50:08,994 --> 00:50:12,131
All right. You gotta pull the bus over. 
You're not riding safely. Park.

688
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:19,240
Jennifer.

689
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:22,777
That's a lovely name.

690
00:50:25,014 --> 00:50:26,014
Oh Jennifer.

691
00:50:29,090 --> 00:50:31,618
What's your last name?

692
00:50:37,903 --> 00:50:38,903
Aniston?

693
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:47,307
Jennifer Aniston.

694
00:50:49,209 --> 00:50:51,253
There's room for two in this world.

695
00:50:52,861 --> 00:50:55,608
Good going! It's OK! It's all right!

696
00:50:57,490 --> 00:50:59,479
Good work today, Jennifer.

697
00:52:24,717 --> 00:52:26,980
It's a remote-controlled vibrating egg.

698
00:52:28,037 --> 00:52:29,965
Where'd you get this?

699
00:52:30,370 --> 00:52:31,370
That's not important.

700
00:52:35,389 --> 00:52:36,915
OK, so here's the plan:

701
00:52:36,950 --> 00:52:40,334
We'll mingle separately to see what we can experience safely,

702
00:52:40,335 --> 00:52:43,720
and once in a while, I want you to check in with me

703
00:52:43,721 --> 00:52:44,721
with this.

704
00:52:45,526 --> 00:52:46,945
Jesus Christ, Sophia!

705
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:51,612
I want you to have control. 
So if you're feeling threatened or horny

706
00:52:51,647 --> 00:52:54,139
or if you just wanna check in and say "Hey", 
buzz me, OK?

707
00:52:57,124 --> 00:52:58,977
Come on, it'll be fun!

708
00:52:58,978 --> 00:52:59,978
It'll be hot.

709
00:53:03,085 --> 00:53:04,085
Come back, bitch!

710
00:53:06,755 --> 00:53:08,193
That's "Bumble bee kisses".

711
00:53:08,194 --> 00:53:09,194
Oh, that's nice.

712
00:53:41,693 --> 00:53:45,101
It's just like the 60s, only with less hope.

713
00:53:46,239 --> 00:53:47,646
See anything you like?

714
00:53:47,647 --> 00:53:50,558
Oh Jesus. It's a lot of stuff that I'm seeing. It's incredible.

715
00:53:52,049 --> 00:53:54,534
For a minute I thought that man didn't have an arm.

716
00:53:55,633 --> 00:53:58,902
So, how's the big O coming?

717
00:53:59,911 --> 00:54:00,911
Oh, everybody's talking about it.

718
00:54:00,912 --> 00:54:04,755
Everybody here knows.
"That's the girl that can't have orgasms."

719
00:54:06,101 --> 00:54:08,665
You're sitting up here in your corner 
with your flower choking your throat.

720
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:12,481
I mean, sweetheart, you gotta loosen up a little bit.

721
00:54:12,482 --> 00:54:14,350
I mean, you have nice boobs.

722
00:54:14,385 --> 00:54:17,276
You've got what it takes, sweetheart, what's the holdup?

723
00:54:17,277 --> 00:54:21,213
I think I have some sort of clog in my neural pathways

724
00:54:21,248 --> 00:54:23,878
somewhere between my brain and my clitoris.

725
00:54:24,699 --> 00:54:26,046
That's disgusting.

726
00:54:26,047 --> 00:54:27,047
No, I'm serious.

727
00:54:27,048 --> 00:54:28,381
Don't think of it as a clog.

728
00:54:28,416 --> 00:54:35,574
Think of it as some sort of magical circuit board. 
A motherboard, filled with desire, that travels all over the world.

729
00:54:35,575 --> 00:54:38,432
That touches you, that touches me, that connects everybody.

730
00:54:38,467 --> 00:54:42,043
You just have to find the right connection, the right circuitry.

731
00:54:42,044 --> 00:54:43,754
Look at all these people out there.

732
00:54:43,789 --> 00:54:45,451
They're trying to find the right connection.

733
00:54:45,452 --> 00:54:47,973
And I personally expect a few blown fuses

734
00:54:48,008 --> 00:54:49,462
before the night is over.

735
00:54:49,463 --> 00:54:51,761
And maybe one of them will be yours.

736
00:54:53,821 --> 00:54:57,401
Are you suggesting that Rob and I aren't compatible sexually?

737
00:54:57,930 --> 00:54:58,930
Who the hell is Rob?

738
00:54:58,931 --> 00:54:59,931
My husband.

739
00:54:59,932 --> 00:55:00,932
Well, where is he right now?

740
00:55:00,933 --> 00:55:01,933
I don't know.

741
00:55:02,580 --> 00:55:04,516
Well, then it's time to play.

742
00:55:04,551 --> 00:55:09,061
You've got the whole world. It's your playground. What do you think it will take?

743
00:55:09,096 --> 00:55:13,788
Maybe somebody who's just starting to explore their sexuality, somebody...

744
00:55:13,823 --> 00:55:14,900
Like a child?

745
00:55:16,104 --> 00:55:17,746
No.

746
00:55:17,781 --> 00:55:18,781
Not a child.

747
00:55:18,782 --> 00:55:21,186
I'm not recommending it. I'm just asking.

748
00:55:21,187 --> 00:55:23,385
I'm just trying to help you, dear.

749
00:55:24,616 --> 00:55:25,616
You're touching my thigh.

750
00:55:25,617 --> 00:55:26,617
Oh, I'm sorry.

751
00:55:26,618 --> 00:55:27,618
It's OK.

752
00:55:28,262 --> 00:55:29,262
I don't mind.

753
00:55:33,693 --> 00:55:37,933
Hey-- OK. What if I asked you, um-- if I can kiss you?

754
00:55:39,523 --> 00:55:41,167
Well, I don't know, I mean...

755
00:55:41,631 --> 00:55:43,550
I get really scared sometimes, but...

756
00:55:45,453 --> 00:55:49,004
all right, if you want to, but...
just real gently.

757
00:55:52,509 --> 00:55:53,509
OK.

758
00:56:15,290 --> 00:56:17,435
Wow. That was fast.

759
00:56:17,436 --> 00:56:19,318
No, it's my husband.
- Oh.

760
00:56:19,353 --> 00:56:22,701
He's trying to communicate with me.
- Oh.

761
00:56:30,784 --> 00:56:33,866
Oh my godness, how sad! Do you want a hug?
- I just want--
- Can I use your leash for a second?

762
00:56:37,133 --> 00:56:39,433
Jesus, do you have a cellphone in your twat?

763
00:56:39,434 --> 00:56:41,836
No, it's-- um, he's got the remote control.

764
00:56:41,871 --> 00:56:44,728
It's... this... vibrating, uh...

765
00:56:45,871 --> 00:56:51,051
OK, lady. Well, you know, best of luck, thanks for everything,

766
00:56:51,086 --> 00:56:54,976
as my dear departed friend Lotus Weinstock used to say:

767
00:56:54,978 --> 00:56:57,166
"I used to want to change the world.

768
00:56:57,167 --> 00:57:00,938
"Now I just want to leave the room with a little dignity."

769
00:57:00,939 --> 00:57:04,009
Excuse me while I crawl out of here.
- Um...

770
00:57:16,102 --> 00:57:17,102
That's fun.

771
00:57:20,125 --> 00:57:21,125
Are you guys hard?

772
00:57:22,828 --> 00:57:25,140
I get something to drink. I'll be right back.

773
00:57:29,616 --> 00:57:31,902
Wow. So weird.

774
00:57:32,369 --> 00:57:33,948
He's awesome.

775
00:57:37,852 --> 00:57:39,117
Do you think that...

776
00:57:39,152 --> 00:57:40,300
What?

777
00:57:43,464 --> 00:57:48,400
I don't know, I mean, 
I've heard of three-way relationships,

778
00:57:48,435 --> 00:57:50,142
but they're mostly in Berkeley.

779
00:57:51,303 --> 00:57:52,303
What do you think?

780
00:57:52,304 --> 00:57:53,304
I don't know.

781
00:57:53,305 --> 00:57:54,305
He's great.

782
00:57:54,306 --> 00:57:56,516
And I think we'll learn to do a lot, you know.

783
00:57:58,417 --> 00:58:00,157
That's good. It's a good thing.

784
00:58:04,098 --> 00:58:05,098
What?

785
00:58:05,099 --> 00:58:06,099
It's a good thing?

786
00:58:06,100 --> 00:58:07,100
Yeah!

787
00:58:08,928 --> 00:58:10,708
What's a good thing?

788
00:58:12,737 --> 00:58:13,302
I just think...

789
00:58:13,337 --> 00:58:14,791
Do you hear yourself?

790
00:58:14,826 --> 00:58:16,682
Do you even know what you're saying any more?

791
00:58:16,683 --> 00:58:17,683
'Cause I don't.

792
00:58:19,202 --> 00:58:22,170
I'm sick of having to drag every little thing out of you.

793
00:58:24,453 --> 00:58:26,383
I mean--

794
00:58:26,384 --> 00:58:29,168
I know you get depressed, but come on!

795
00:58:30,357 --> 00:58:31,357
I'm trying!

796
00:58:38,002 --> 00:58:39,002
Do you love me?

797
00:58:42,345 --> 00:58:44,178
You don't love me any more?

798
00:59:02,420 --> 00:59:03,420
Severin! Wait up!

799
00:59:03,421 --> 00:59:04,421
Wait!

800
00:59:13,401 --> 00:59:15,165
Ohhhhh!

801
00:59:15,166 --> 00:59:17,020
How's it going?

802
00:59:17,030 --> 00:59:18,456
Pretty great.

803
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:21,078
You had an orgasm?

804
00:59:21,793 --> 00:59:24,371
No, but-- I made out with somebody.

805
00:59:24,719 --> 00:59:25,370
Who?

806
00:59:25,405 --> 00:59:26,405
Justin Bond.

807
00:59:28,173 --> 00:59:29,678
He's an homosexual!

808
00:59:29,679 --> 00:59:31,181
Apparently not.

809
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:32,607
Oh my god.

810
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:33,800
Well, he's really cute.

811
00:59:33,801 --> 00:59:35,293
Yeah, he is.

812
00:59:35,774 --> 00:59:38,126
I saw Rob, by the way.

813
00:59:40,271 --> 00:59:41,721
Yeah. What was he up to?

814
00:59:42,590 --> 00:59:44,543
He was getting fucked up the ass.

815
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:47,960
It was really intense.

816
00:59:48,192 --> 00:59:49,192
Oh god.

817
00:59:51,552 --> 00:59:53,074
I'm just kidding.

818
00:59:54,697 --> 00:59:57,178
You brat!
- No, seriously, though-- he was.

819
00:59:59,805 --> 01:00:01,421
I should probably go find him.

820
01:00:03,763 --> 01:00:04,763
What's with him?

821
01:00:05,681 --> 01:00:08,309
That fucking trust fund muppet Jesse is

822
01:00:09,820 --> 01:00:12,586
like the longest relationship I've ever had.

823
01:00:13,173 --> 01:00:15,432
You deserve so much more, Jennifer.

824
01:00:15,433 --> 01:00:18,434
Thank you, but I can't respond to that name yet.

825
01:00:18,435 --> 01:00:19,435
I'm sorry.

826
01:00:25,089 --> 01:00:27,233
I can't do it any more.

827
01:00:29,795 --> 01:00:31,073
I can't...

828
01:00:31,074 --> 01:00:32,403
I just like...

829
01:00:32,438 --> 01:00:38,073
wanna have like a house, a cat, 
a pet, you know what I'm saying?

830
01:00:40,390 --> 01:00:41,390
I'm sorry.

831
01:00:41,391 --> 01:00:43,075
No, you shouldn't apologize.

832
01:00:43,110 --> 01:00:45,049
I'm glad that you're telling me these things.

833
01:00:45,050 --> 01:00:46,050
I want to hear you say these things.

834
01:00:47,773 --> 01:00:49,191
I'm gonna save up all my money,

835
01:00:49,192 --> 01:00:53,254
and then I'm just gonna make art for a year. Nothing else.

836
01:00:54,104 --> 01:00:55,303
I know you can do it.

837
01:00:55,304 --> 01:00:57,503
But everything's so fucking expensive!

838
01:00:58,319 --> 01:01:00,970
I don't even know if I can afford to live in New York any more.

839
01:01:01,005 --> 01:01:03,160
Where would I go, Fresno?

840
01:01:10,707 --> 01:01:11,707
It's OK.

841
01:01:14,765 --> 01:01:16,585
Your skin is so soft.

842
01:01:51,248 --> 01:01:52,248
Jesus.

843
01:01:52,657 --> 01:01:53,657
Rob.

844
01:01:53,658 --> 01:01:54,658
Hi, Rob.

845
01:02:00,275 --> 01:02:01,275
Oh my god.

846
01:02:05,865 --> 01:02:06,865
Oh, man.

847
01:02:11,391 --> 01:02:12,391
Oh god.

848
01:02:23,574 --> 01:02:26,161
Don't move.

849
01:02:46,907 --> 01:02:47,907
I'm so sorry.

850
01:02:51,632 --> 01:02:52,632
It's OK.

851
01:02:52,667 --> 01:02:53,633
I'm sorry.

852
01:02:53,634 --> 01:02:54,634
Don't apologize.
- Fuck.

853
01:03:04,258 --> 01:03:06,798
I just-- I'm like, so sensitive.

854
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:10,925
I should find Rob.

855
01:03:13,516 --> 01:03:15,505
You can tell me all about it tomorrow.

856
01:03:18,862 --> 01:03:19,862
Actually, um--

857
01:03:22,152 --> 01:03:25,648
I can't make it tomorrow, but I will give you a call.

858
01:03:28,221 --> 01:03:31,991
I'll give you a call. Later this week.

859
01:03:51,588 --> 01:03:52,532
Christ.

860
01:03:52,567 --> 01:03:53,567
Truth or dare?

861
01:03:53,816 --> 01:03:54,816
Truth.

862
01:03:54,817 --> 01:03:59,437
Out of everyone here, who would you want to make out with the most?

863
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:01,499
No one.

864
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:02,500
What?
- Bus cow.

865
01:04:04,552 --> 01:04:05,552
OK, spin.

866
01:04:11,510 --> 01:04:12,510
Dare.

867
01:04:12,511 --> 01:04:15,030
You and Severin have to go in that closet.

868
01:04:15,065 --> 01:04:18,808
You do whatever the fuck you want to to her, for five minutes. While we take a pee break.

869
01:04:25,154 --> 01:04:26,154
Oh my god.

870
01:04:41,313 --> 01:04:43,967
I'm not gonna make out with you, OK?

871
01:04:45,043 --> 01:04:46,043
I'm James.

872
01:04:46,573 --> 01:04:47,573
Severin.

873
01:04:52,708 --> 01:04:53,708
What is that?

874
01:04:54,376 --> 01:04:55,376
It's my film.

875
01:04:57,756 --> 01:04:58,956
What is it about?

876
01:05:02,311 --> 01:05:04,051
I have a hard time saying.

877
01:05:05,466 --> 01:05:07,038
Are you showing it here tonight?

878
01:05:09,487 --> 01:05:10,487
I don't know.

879
01:05:11,478 --> 01:05:13,488
What are you guys doing in there?

880
01:05:15,098 --> 01:05:16,098
I hate him.

881
01:05:17,901 --> 01:05:19,475
He can be a lot worse.

882
01:05:21,211 --> 01:05:22,211
At least he's cute.

883
01:05:23,225 --> 01:05:24,589
That's pretty unusual.

884
01:05:26,291 --> 01:05:27,553
What's pretty unusual?

885
01:05:28,790 --> 01:05:30,940
I never had a john that cute.

886
01:05:38,086 --> 01:05:40,031
You know how we got started?

887
01:05:40,066 --> 01:05:41,066
How?

888
01:05:41,067 --> 01:05:45,529
After watching "My own private Idaho".

889
01:05:45,564 --> 01:05:47,500
I grew up in a small town, so I didn't know where to go.

890
01:05:49,411 --> 01:05:52,384
So I waited outside the theater where it was playing.

891
01:05:52,385 --> 01:05:55,097
I waited for somebody to come out.

892
01:05:55,625 --> 01:05:56,625
And that's where I met my first john.

893
01:05:57,733 --> 01:05:59,254
So was it choice?

894
01:06:01,150 --> 01:06:02,150
Yeah.

895
01:06:04,387 --> 01:06:06,022
I loved it actually.

896
01:06:07,661 --> 01:06:10,149
I knew exactly what I was worth.

897
01:06:10,704 --> 01:06:11,704
You know?

898
01:06:13,064 --> 01:06:15,290
Exactly what I had to contribute.

899
01:06:15,985 --> 01:06:18,926
What was like, the most you ever made in a day?

900
01:06:21,757 --> 01:06:24,211
Well, with cab fare--

901
01:06:24,212 --> 01:06:25,212
$389.

902
01:06:28,945 --> 01:06:31,680
That's pretty good for a small town.

903
01:06:35,128 --> 01:06:37,612
You're with that guy who looks just like you, right?

904
01:06:37,613 --> 01:06:38,613
Yeah.

905
01:06:40,356 --> 01:06:42,307
He's cute. He looks like a jelly bean.

906
01:06:44,021 --> 01:06:45,021
Yeah.

907
01:06:47,028 --> 01:06:48,780
He's great, actually.

908
01:06:53,436 --> 01:06:55,474
I never let him fuck me.

909
01:06:57,594 --> 01:07:00,284
I never let anybody fuck me.

910
01:07:08,276 --> 01:07:10,187
What are you guys doing in there?

911
01:07:17,214 --> 01:07:17,417
You're an artist.

912
01:07:18,303 --> 01:07:19,494
No. I suck.

913
01:07:20,199 --> 01:07:21,556
Hey, me too.

914
01:07:23,593 --> 01:07:25,773
Do you take that camera everywhere you go?

915
01:07:25,774 --> 01:07:26,774
Yeah, something like that.

916
01:07:38,339 --> 01:07:39,339
Are you OK?

917
01:07:46,244 --> 01:07:47,883
Why are you crying?

918
01:07:56,227 --> 01:08:00,206
I look back to things that were when I was 12 years old.

919
01:08:02,357 --> 01:08:05,159
I'm still looking for the same things now.

920
01:08:15,831 --> 01:08:17,764
Time's up.

921
01:08:24,071 --> 01:08:25,571
Hey, what are you doing?

922
01:08:25,572 --> 01:08:26,572
I'm looking for my husband.

923
01:08:26,573 --> 01:08:28,329
I just found mine.

924
01:08:28,364 --> 01:08:32,826
Both of them. I'm totally in love with them. 
But together. Not so much separately.

925
01:08:32,827 --> 01:08:34,911
 I hope they know it's gonna have to be a monogamous relationship.
- Excuse me.

926
01:08:36,548 --> 01:08:38,236
What the fuck do you think you're doing?

927
01:08:38,237 --> 01:08:39,152
Who are you?

928
01:08:39,153 --> 01:08:40,198
Who the fuck are <i>you</i>?

929
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:41,722
I'm Ceth. Is there a problem?

930
01:08:41,723 --> 01:08:42,723
You're not funny.

931
01:08:42,724 --> 01:08:43,724
I thought it was kinda funny.

932
01:08:43,725 --> 01:08:46,715
No you're not. And you're a horrible therapist.

933
01:08:46,716 --> 01:08:49,389
Listen to me: James and Jamie are perfect.

934
01:08:49,390 --> 01:08:50,390
Just leave them alone.

935
01:08:50,391 --> 01:08:51,391
I think you need to leave.

936
01:08:51,392 --> 01:08:53,621
No. I think you're fucking with something very pivotal to them and to me.

937
01:08:53,622 --> 01:08:54,622
Just walk away!

938
01:08:54,623 --> 01:08:55,623
Fuck you!

939
01:08:55,624 --> 01:08:56,624
You motherfucker!

940
01:08:56,625 --> 01:08:57,625
OK, OK.

941
01:09:00,022 --> 01:09:01,022
Timeout, timeout.

942
01:09:02,839 --> 01:09:03,839
Sorry, I--

943
01:09:06,681 --> 01:09:07,612
Are you OK?

944
01:09:07,647 --> 01:09:09,985
I've got an egg vibrating between my legs!

945
01:09:29,808 --> 01:09:30,808
What the fuck is going on in here?

946
01:09:32,216 --> 01:09:34,918
Hey. Are you OK?

947
01:09:36,702 --> 01:09:37,702
You gave it away?

948
01:09:37,703 --> 01:09:38,703
I just misplaced it.

949
01:09:39,699 --> 01:09:40,390
I know you're hurt.

950
01:09:40,425 --> 01:09:42,903
I am not hurt. I am furious!

951
01:09:42,904 --> 01:09:45,985
I totally honor your feelings, but I want you to own them.

952
01:09:45,986 --> 01:09:47,814
Shut up with your "honoring your feelings". 
And do not tell me what to own.

953
01:09:47,849 --> 01:09:50,640
Because I know what I own, 

954
01:09:50,641 --> 01:09:53,166
you balding impotent liar!

955
01:09:53,167 --> 01:09:55,093
Right, sister!

956
01:09:57,750 --> 01:09:59,847
All right, show's over. 
We're gonna be processing to the next room now.

957
01:10:01,492 --> 01:10:02,492
Hey.

958
01:10:24,942 --> 01:10:27,798
Fuck! Fuck!

959
01:12:57,743 --> 01:12:59,535
Yes. I--I need an ambulance.

960
01:12:59,570 --> 01:13:01,988
I'm at the Palestra Gym. It's on 99...

961
01:14:28,239 --> 01:14:29,239
Hello?

962
01:14:29,661 --> 01:14:31,134
Who is this?

963
01:14:34,237 --> 01:14:37,027
Oh. Hey. How are you?

964
01:14:38,410 --> 01:14:40,288
Do I know you?

965
01:14:42,291 --> 01:14:43,291
No.

966
01:14:46,239 --> 01:14:48,143
Did you follow me?

967
01:14:49,810 --> 01:14:52,149
Why would you wanna do that to yourself?

968
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:59,657
James-- Yes, I followed you to the gym.

969
01:15:05,516 --> 01:15:07,554
Why?

970
01:15:07,555 --> 01:15:09,979
Let's not talk about this on the phone.

971
01:15:09,980 --> 01:15:12,021
What does your afternoon look like?

972
01:15:14,719 --> 01:15:19,944
I'm looking for a friend. His last name is Baysin.

973
01:15:21,312 --> 01:15:22,312
B-A-Y-

974
01:15:24,492 --> 01:15:26,565
What do you mean, he checked himself out?

975
01:15:27,909 --> 01:15:29,345
So what do you want?

976
01:15:29,346 --> 01:15:32,222
I want to be restrained, but I don't want to totally lose control.

977
01:15:32,223 --> 01:15:33,306
Good.

978
01:15:33,341 --> 01:15:35,769
'Cause I can't be bothered to tie you up.

979
01:15:35,770 --> 01:15:39,253
Turn over and hold the headbar. If you let go, I'll leave.

980
01:15:44,175 --> 01:15:45,994
You never asked your wife to do this?

981
01:15:46,828 --> 01:15:48,569
I guess she wouldn't understand.

982
01:15:49,146 --> 01:15:50,146
All right.

983
01:15:51,460 --> 01:15:53,294
This one's for her.

984
01:15:58,731 --> 01:16:01,702
And I told Brad, "I think you're confusing me with someone who hurt you."

985
01:16:03,008 --> 01:16:07,994
And he said, "No, Cheryl, you're hurting me."

986
01:16:10,508 --> 01:16:11,508
Right?

987
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:15,216
And that was an eye opener for me.

988
01:16:18,442 --> 01:16:21,621
And whenever I brought up my gastrointestinal problem...

989
01:16:37,784 --> 01:16:39,473
When did you start watching me?

990
01:16:42,178 --> 01:16:43,939
Um, a couple of years ago.

991
01:16:46,006 --> 01:16:47,968
I work right out of here. 

992
01:16:47,969 --> 01:16:49,754
I proofread for a living.

993
01:16:51,581 --> 01:16:53,065
I don't have cable.

994
01:16:53,066 --> 01:16:55,818
I remember watching Jamie cut your hair.

995
01:16:59,378 --> 01:17:01,312
It just seemed like fun.

996
01:17:02,659 --> 01:17:04,600
And you were always my favorite,

997
01:17:04,601 --> 01:17:06,546
because you were sad.

998
01:17:09,130 --> 01:17:10,719
Do you have a boyfriend?

999
01:17:11,713 --> 01:17:15,255
Look, James, please, you have to call Jamie, OK?

1000
01:17:15,256 --> 01:17:16,256
Just call him.

1001
01:17:16,257 --> 01:17:17,257
You can use my phone.

1002
01:17:31,185 --> 01:17:33,409
Why won't he come home?

1003
01:17:34,584 --> 01:17:36,543
Wouldn't you wanna go home?

1004
01:18:17,623 --> 01:18:19,812
What are you doing?

1005
01:18:22,095 --> 01:18:23,770
I don't understand?

1006
01:18:26,116 --> 01:18:28,304
What are you doing here?

1007
01:18:30,174 --> 01:18:32,580
Explain it to me, please.

1008
01:18:34,098 --> 01:18:37,235
First you bring Ceth into the relationship--

1009
01:18:37,236 --> 01:18:38,236
What's wrong with you?

1010
01:18:39,095 --> 01:18:40,975
I didn't want Jamie to be alone.

1011
01:18:43,070 --> 01:18:45,213
How long have you been planning this?

1012
01:18:47,427 --> 01:18:51,617
What, so you've been making a suicide tape for the last six months?

1013
01:18:52,532 --> 01:18:54,950
I just wanted him to know it wasn't his fault.

1014
01:18:57,839 --> 01:18:59,361
Jamie loves you.

1015
01:19:01,589 --> 01:19:03,044
You have so much.

1016
01:19:06,142 --> 01:19:07,142
I know.

1017
01:19:09,717 --> 01:19:11,818
I see it all around me.

1018
01:19:14,805 --> 01:19:16,860
But it stops at my skin.

1019
01:19:19,212 --> 01:19:21,240
I can't let it inside.

1020
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:25,396
It's always been like that.

1021
01:19:26,714 --> 01:19:29,074
It's always gonna be like that.

1022
01:19:31,536 --> 01:19:34,520
I can feel it in little moments with Jamie,

1023
01:19:34,555 --> 01:19:36,594
because he loves me so hard.

1024
01:19:39,016 --> 01:19:42,853
He loves me as hard as the people who treated me like shit.

1025
01:19:48,397 --> 01:19:49,397
I can't feel it.

1026
01:19:51,925 --> 01:19:52,925
Don't.

1027
01:19:55,207 --> 01:19:56,207
Don't. Don't. No.

1028
01:19:57,901 --> 01:19:58,901
No. No.

1029
01:20:02,293 --> 01:20:04,612
Go! Go!

1030
01:20:06,482 --> 01:20:08,551
Don't you see that I don't wanna be this!

1031
01:20:09,086 --> 01:20:11,317
... if that makes people uncomfortable, then it makes us uncomfortable.

1032
01:20:13,662 --> 01:20:15,862
But at least it's truthful.

1033
01:20:16,291 --> 01:20:17,954
I don't want to lie any more.

1034
01:20:17,955 --> 01:20:20,805
Because that isn't who I am, and it isn't who I'm trying to, who we're trying to be.

1035
01:21:48,422 --> 01:21:50,769
I have to get some sort of information,

1036
01:21:50,770 --> 01:21:54,872
because the patient that was there checked himself out.

1037
01:21:54,907 --> 01:21:56,061
Ceth!

1038
01:23:10,177 --> 01:23:11,910
Are you sure?

1039
01:24:05,999 --> 01:24:09,417
Be glad you followed me out into the fucking cold
and bucked a date

1040
01:24:09,452 --> 01:24:11,510
so you could feel something?

1041
01:24:12,604 --> 01:24:15,274
It's hard not to feel anything in your life.

1042
01:24:15,309 --> 01:24:17,250
Do you feel it now, you little faggot?

1043
01:24:53,791 --> 01:24:55,665
Don't you fucking look at me. 

1044
01:24:56,312 --> 01:24:58,186
Don't fucking look at me!

1045
01:25:05,443 --> 01:25:06,443
It's OK.

1046
01:26:50,332 --> 01:26:53,983
"... is doing everything possible to get some power back,

1047
01:26:53,984 --> 01:26:57,611
"and he's advising calm, which seems unnecessary,

1048
01:26:57,646 --> 01:27:01,239
"because there's been no reported incidents of looting or violence of any kind.

1049
01:27:01,240 --> 01:27:04,000
"So far, no explanation for what caused the...

1050
01:27:04,033 --> 01:27:07,135
I'm out to get some fruit and some batteries. 
I'll be back in five minutes.

1051
01:27:07,882 --> 01:27:11,416
"... no reason to believe that this is the result of terrorist acts..."
