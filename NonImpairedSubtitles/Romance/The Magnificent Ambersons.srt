1
00:00:26,355 --> 00:00:31,150
The magnificence of the
Ambersons began in 1873

2
00:00:31,444 --> 00:00:35,437
Their splendour lasted throughout
all the years that saw their

3
00:00:35,691 --> 00:00:37,457
midland town spread and
darken into a city.

4
00:00:39,045 --> 00:00:43,022
In that town, in those days,
all the women who wore silk or velvet

5
00:00:43,342 --> 00:00:45,644
knew all the other women who wore
silk or velvet

6
00:00:46,644 --> 00:00:49,045
and everybody knew everybody else's
family horse and carriage.

7
00:00:50,545 --> 00:00:52,445
The only public advance was
the street car.

8
00:00:54,996 --> 00:00:56,056
A lady could whistle to it from an upstairs
window

9
00:00:56,346 --> 00:00:59,449
and the car would hold at once
and wait for her

10
00:00:59,649 --> 00:01:05,650
while she shut her window, put on her hat
and coat, went downstairs, found an umbrella

11
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,032
told the girl what to have for dinner

12
00:01:10,171 --> 00:01:10,852
and came forth from the house.

13
00:01:12,254 --> 00:01:15,815
Too slow for us nowadays,
because the faster we are carried

14
00:01:16,454 --> 00:01:18,981
the less time we have to spare.

1
00:01:19,393 --> 00:01:21,189
During the earlier
years of this period

2
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:24,650
while bangs and bustles were
having their way with women,

3
00:01:24,902 --> 00:01:26,652
there were seen men of
all ages to whom a hat

4
00:01:26,903 --> 00:01:31,698
meant only that rigid
tall silk thing

5
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:33,160
known to impudents
as a "stove pipe."

6
00:01:34,075 --> 00:01:35,328
But the long contagion of
the derby had arrived:

7
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:39,455
one season the crown of
this hat would be a bucket,

8
00:01:39,707 --> 00:01:41,626
next it would be a spoon.

9
00:01:41,835 --> 00:01:45,629
Every house still kept its
bootjack, but high top boots

10
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,674
gave way to shoes
and congress gaiters

11
00:01:47,826 --> 00:01:51,845
and these were played through
fashions that shaped them now with

12
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:55,141
toes like box ends, and now with
toes like the prows of racing shells.

13
00:01:55,974 --> 00:01:57,893
Trousers with a crease were
considered plebeian; the

14
00:01:58,142 --> 00:02:00,853
crease proved that the garment
had lain upon a shelf,

15
00:02:01,104 --> 00:02:02,941
and hence was ready-made.

16
00:02:03,441 --> 00:02:06,444
With evening dress, a gentleman
wore a tan overcoat...so short that

17
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:10,948
his black coattails hung visible
5 inches below the overcoat.

18
00:02:11,156 --> 00:02:14,953
But after a season or two
he lengthened his overcoat
till it touched his heels.

19
00:02:15,663 --> 00:02:18,432
And he passed out of
his tight trousers

20
00:02:18,582 --> 00:02:20,792
into trousers like great bags.

21
00:02:22,878 --> 00:02:24,629
In those days,

22
00:02:24,838 --> 00:02:26,966
they had time for everything:

23
00:02:27,258 --> 00:02:29,927
time for sleigh rides, and balls,

24
00:02:30,175 --> 00:02:32,846
and assemblies, and cotillions.

25
00:02:33,097 --> 00:02:37,309
And open house on New Year's, and
all-day picnics in the woods.

26
00:02:37,643 --> 00:02:40,895
And even that prettiest
of all vanished customs,

27
00:02:41,146 --> 00:02:43,191
the serenade.

28
00:02:43,442 --> 00:02:44,609
Of a summer night,

29
00:02:44,859 --> 00:02:47,737
young men would bring an orchestra
under a pretty girl's window

30
00:02:47,989 --> 00:02:51,490
a flute, harp, fiddle,
cello, coronet, bass viole,

31
00:02:51,741 --> 00:02:55,163
would presently release their
melodies to the dulcet stars.

32
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:03,628
Against so home-spun a backdrop,

33
00:03:03,881 --> 00:03:06,422
the magnificence of the Ambersons

34
00:03:06,673 --> 00:03:09,552
was as conspicuous as a
brass band at a funeral.

35
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,597
There it is!

36
00:03:10,846 --> 00:03:12,097
The Amberson mansion!

37
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:14,850
- The pride of the town!
- Well, well...

38
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,517
$60,000 for the woodwork alone!

39
00:03:17,767 --> 00:03:20,229
- Hot and cold running water...
- Upstairs and down.

40
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:23,858
And stationary washstands in
every last bedroom in the place.

41
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,159
Is Miss Amberson at home?

42
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:35,495
No sir, Mr. Morgan.
Miss Amberson's not home.

43
00:03:36,955 --> 00:03:38,165
Well, thanks Sam...

44
00:03:48,675 --> 00:03:52,513
No sir, Miss Amberson ain't
home for you, Mr. Morgan.

45
00:03:53,137 --> 00:03:54,224
Thanks.

46
00:03:56,309 --> 00:03:58,060
- I guess she's still mad at him.
- Who?

47
00:03:58,729 --> 00:04:00,812
- Isabel.
- Major Amberson's daughter.

48
00:04:01,063 --> 00:04:03,273
Eugene Morgan's her best beau!

49
00:04:03,566 --> 00:04:06,071
Took a bit too much to drink
the other night right out here,

50
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:10,198
- and stepped clean through the
bass fiddle that was serenadin' her!
- Well, well.

51
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:14,870
I haven't seen her since
she got back from abroad.

52
00:04:16,037 --> 00:04:19,416
Isabel? Well sir, I don't know
as I know just how to put it,

53
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:22,002
but she's, she's kind of a,

54
00:04:22,254 --> 00:04:24,712
delightful-looking young lady.

55
00:04:41,273 --> 00:04:44,191
Wilbur? Wilbur Minafer?

56
00:04:44,483 --> 00:04:45,987
I never thought he'd get her.

57
00:04:46,027 --> 00:04:47,529
Well, whaddya know!

58
00:04:47,779 --> 00:04:50,740
Well, Wilbur may not be
any Apollo, as it were,

59
00:04:50,991 --> 00:04:52,575
but he's a steady young businessman.

60
00:04:52,826 --> 00:04:54,162
Wilbur Minafer!

61
00:04:54,453 --> 00:04:57,832
Looks like Isabel's pretty
sensible for such a showy girl.

62
00:04:58,083 --> 00:05:00,834
- To think of her takin' him!
- Yes, just because a man any

63
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:04,256
woman would like a thousand times
better was a little wild one night

64
00:05:04,547 --> 00:05:08,218
- at a serenade.
- What she minds was him makin' a
clown of himself in her own front yard.

65
00:05:08,511 --> 00:05:10,262
Made her think he didn't
care much about her!

66
00:05:10,553 --> 00:05:14,098
She's probably mistaken, but it's too
late for her to think anything else now.

67
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:17,101
The wedding will be a
big Amberson style thing...

68
00:05:17,393 --> 00:05:20,607
Raw oysters floating in
scooped-out blocks of ice,

69
00:05:20,856 --> 00:05:23,565
a band, from out of town,
and then Wilbur will take

70
00:05:23,716 --> 00:05:26,947
Isabel on the carefullest little
wedding trip he can manage.

71
00:05:27,197 --> 00:05:29,473
And she'll be a good wife
to him, but they'll have

72
00:05:29,624 --> 00:05:32,827
the worst-spoiled lot of children
this town will ever see.

73
00:05:33,077 --> 00:05:34,954
How on earth do you figure
that out, Mrs. Foster?

74
00:05:35,206 --> 00:05:37,289
She couldn't love Wilbur, could she?

75
00:05:37,665 --> 00:05:40,585
Well! It'll all go to her children.

76
00:05:40,836 --> 00:05:42,669
And she'll ruin them.

77
00:05:43,131 --> 00:05:47,591
The prophetess proved to be
mistaken in a single detail merely,

78
00:05:47,842 --> 00:05:51,139
Wilbur and Isabel did not have
"children," they had only one.

79
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:52,138
Only one,

80
00:05:52,431 --> 00:05:56,310
But I'd like to know if he isn't
spoiled enough for a whole carload!

81
00:05:56,852 --> 00:05:59,146
Again, she found none to challenge her

82
00:05:59,438 --> 00:06:02,899
and George Amberson Minafer,
the Major's one grandchild,

83
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:04,361
was a princely terror.

84
00:06:04,645 --> 00:06:09,031
Hey! Go, I guess you
think you own this town?

85
00:06:10,408 --> 00:06:13,201
There were people...grown
people they were,

86
00:06:13,617 --> 00:06:16,081
who expressed themselves longingly.

87
00:06:16,288 --> 00:06:18,667
They did hope to live to
see the day, they said,

88
00:06:19,794 --> 00:06:21,753
when that boy would
get his come-uppance.

89
00:06:22,003 --> 00:06:24,881
- His...what?
- His come-uppance.

90
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:28,050
Something's bound to
take him down some day.

91
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,636
I only want to be there!

92
00:06:30,179 --> 00:06:31,472
Nah, the little girly-curly,

93
00:06:32,056 --> 00:06:33,722
Nah, the little girly-curly,

94
00:06:33,932 --> 00:06:36,185
Say Bob, where'd you steal
your mother's old sash?

95
00:06:36,476 --> 00:06:38,062
Your sister stole it for me!

96
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:41,064
She stole it off our old
clothesline and gave it to me!

97
00:06:41,314 --> 00:06:44,401
You go get your hair cut!
You and I haven't got any sister!

98
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:47,698
Yeah, I know you haven't at home.
I mean the one that's in jail!

99
00:06:47,948 --> 00:06:49,700
I dare you to get out
of that pony cart!

100
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:52,578
I dare you outside that gate!

101
00:06:53,036 --> 00:06:54,996
I dare ya half way here I dare ya!

102
00:06:55,247 --> 00:06:56,038
Here I come, you...

103
00:07:03,211 --> 00:07:04,505
Little boy!

104
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:05,883
Little boy!

105
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,938
That'll be enough of that!

106
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:20,983
You stop that, you!

107
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:24,028
I guess you don't know who I am!

108
00:07:24,278 --> 00:07:26,404
Yes I do, and you're a
disgrace to your mother!

109
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:27,948
You shut up about my mother!

110
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:30,908
She outta be ashamed of a
bad little boy like you!

111
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:33,370
Be silent you billy goat, you!

112
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,706
Pull down your vest, and
wipe off your chin,

113
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,082
and go to hell!

114
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:38,041
What!

115
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:40,584
This was heard not only by myself,

116
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:43,381
but by my wife, and the
lady who lives next door.

117
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:44,759
He's an old liar.

118
00:07:45,009 --> 00:07:48,136
Georgie...you mustn't say "liar."

119
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:51,764
Dear, did you say
what he says you did?

120
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:56,019
Well, first I wouldn't wipe a
shoe on that old storyteller...

121
00:07:56,269 --> 00:07:57,145
Georgie, you mustn't!

122
00:07:57,394 --> 00:08:00,397
- I mean none of us Amberson's
wouldn't have anything to do with him.
- That's not what we're talking about.

123
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:04,736
I'll bet if he wanted to see any of us,
he'd have to go around to the side door.

124
00:08:04,765 --> 00:08:07,237
- No, you shouldn't say...
- Please, father!

125
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:10,116
Forgive me, he doesn't see a
very tactful person, but...

126
00:08:10,368 --> 00:08:11,660
He's just...riff-raff!

127
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:13,787
Oh, you mustn't say so!

128
00:08:15,122 --> 00:08:17,916
And you must promise me never
to use those bad words again.

129
00:08:18,167 --> 00:08:19,795
I promise not to...

130
00:08:22,337 --> 00:08:24,965
unless I get mad at somebody.

131
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:28,385
Wait'll they send him away to school.

132
00:08:28,677 --> 00:08:30,096
Then he'll get it!

133
00:08:30,345 --> 00:08:33,100
They'll knock the
stuffin' out of him!

134
00:08:33,976 --> 00:08:36,103
But George returned with
the same stuffing.

135
00:08:38,355 --> 00:08:40,942
Bloody siz! See here Bub, does
your mother know that you're out!

136
00:08:41,192 --> 00:08:43,277
Turn down your pants,
you would-be dude!

137
00:08:43,526 --> 00:08:48,197
When Mr. George Amberson
Minafer came home for the
holidays in his sophomore year,

138
00:08:48,448 --> 00:08:51,368
Nothing about him
encouraged any hope

139
00:08:51,618 --> 00:08:53,619
that he had received
his come-uppance.

140
00:08:54,913 --> 00:08:57,791
Cards were out for a
ball in his honour.

141
00:08:58,041 --> 00:09:00,671
And this pageant of the tenantry

142
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:04,006
was the last of the great
long-remembered dances

143
00:09:04,258 --> 00:09:06,592
that everybody talked about.

144
00:09:16,187 --> 00:09:17,312
Hello there...

145
00:09:24,985 --> 00:09:28,823
...that big bow window...
that's where they'll put the
Major when his time comes...

146
00:09:28,908 --> 00:09:31,786
Now don't you look at
me like that, Major!

147
00:09:32,037 --> 00:09:34,663
- Georgie! You look fine!
- Sam.

148
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:38,417
There was a time though in your
fourth month that you were so

149
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:40,670
puny, nobody thought you'd live!

150
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,631
- Where's Fanny?
- Know me very well indeed!

151
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:46,300
Isabel...

152
00:09:47,177 --> 00:09:48,054
Eugene!

153
00:09:49,765 --> 00:09:50,555
This your boy, Isabel?

154
00:09:51,681 --> 00:09:54,560
- George, this is Mr. Morgan.
- Remember you very well indeed.

155
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:58,524
George, you never saw
me before in your life.

156
00:09:58,659 --> 00:09:59,691
But from now on, you're
going to see a lot of me.

157
00:09:59,942 --> 00:10:02,235
- I hope.
- I hope so too, Eugene.

158
00:10:02,484 --> 00:10:03,109
Where's Wilbur?

159
00:10:03,529 --> 00:10:04,863
You'll find him
in the game room

160
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:06,239
with some of the others.

161
00:10:06,487 --> 00:10:08,407
He never was much for
parties, remember?

162
00:10:09,156 --> 00:10:10,578
Yes, I remember.

163
00:10:11,494 --> 00:10:12,371
I'll come back for a dance.

164
00:10:12,869 --> 00:10:14,038
Please do.

165
00:10:14,288 --> 00:10:15,622
- Eugene Morgan, Major Amberson.
- Well, well, well...

166
00:10:17,251 --> 00:10:19,876
Remember you very well indeed.
Remember you very well indeed.

167
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:21,629
Miss Morgan.

168
00:10:22,257 --> 00:10:23,094
(Jeeve!)

169
00:10:24,259 --> 00:10:26,094
Remember you very well indeed!

170
00:10:26,301 --> 00:10:30,138
You don't remember her either,
Georgie. But of course you will.

171
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:32,767
Miss Morgan's from out of town.

172
00:10:33,058 --> 00:10:36,271
You might take her up to the
dancing, I think you've pretty
well done your duty here.

173
00:10:36,521 --> 00:10:37,856
Be delighted.

174
00:10:41,818 --> 00:10:44,362
- What did you say your name was?
- Morgan.

175
00:10:45,321 --> 00:10:46,949
(Oh, well, I'm certainly
glad you're back.)

176
00:10:47,199 --> 00:10:49,199
(It's nice to be back too,
Jack. It's been a long time.)

177
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:50,660
Who's that?

178
00:10:51,413 --> 00:10:53,538
Oh, I didn't catch his name when
my mother presented him to me.

179
00:10:53,787 --> 00:10:55,164
You mean the queer-looking duck?

180
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:57,165
- The who?
- The queer-looking duck.

181
00:10:57,417 --> 00:10:58,795
Oh, I wouldn't say that.

182
00:10:59,087 --> 00:11:00,629
The one with him
is my Uncle Jack.

183
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:02,855
Honourable Jack Amberson.

184
00:11:02,965 --> 00:11:04,220
I thought everybody knew him.

185
00:11:04,269 --> 00:11:08,220
He looks as though everybody
ought to know him. Seems to
run in your family.

186
00:11:08,596 --> 00:11:13,325
Well, I suppose almost everybody
does know him. Out in this part
of the country especially.

187
00:11:14,599 --> 00:11:16,464
- Uncle Jack's pretty well-known.
He's a congressman, you know.
- Oh, really?

188
00:11:17,695 --> 00:11:20,283
Oh, yes. The family always liked
to have somebody in Congress.

189
00:11:20,536 --> 00:11:22,785
It's sort of a good
thing, in one way.

190
00:11:23,585 --> 00:11:24,816
- Hello, Lucy!
- Hello!

191
00:11:27,874 --> 00:11:29,825
How do all these ducks
get to know you so quick?

192
00:11:30,078 --> 00:11:31,267
Oh, I've been here a week.

193
00:11:31,563 --> 00:11:34,319
Seems to me you've
been pretty busy!

194
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,783
- Most of these...
- Hello, Lucy!
- Hello!

195
00:11:37,843 --> 00:11:40,300
Most of these ducks, I don't
know what my mother invited
them here for, anyway.

196
00:11:40,598 --> 00:11:41,829
Don't you like them?

197
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:45,815
Oh I used to be president
of a club we had here and
some of them belonged to it.

198
00:11:46,069 --> 00:11:48,700
But I don't care much for
that sort of thing anymore.

199
00:11:48,955 --> 00:11:50,777
I really don't see why
my mother invited 'em.

200
00:11:51,033 --> 00:11:53,749
Maybe she didn't want to
offend their fathers and mothers.

201
00:11:54,002 --> 00:11:57,733
I hardly think that my mother
need worry about offending
anybody in this old town.

202
00:11:58,242 --> 00:12:01,339
Must be wonderful, Mr.
Amberson. Mr. Minafer, I mean.

203
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:04,606
- What must be wonderful?
- To be so important as that.

204
00:12:04,817 --> 00:12:07,023
- Oh, that isn't important.
- (Good evening.)
- Good evening.

205
00:12:07,277 --> 00:12:11,774
Anybody that really is anybody oughta
be able to do about as they like in
their own town, I should think.

206
00:12:14,704 --> 00:12:19,452
- Hello!
- Well! How's that for a bit
of freshness!

207
00:12:19,705 --> 00:12:22,845
- What was?
- That queer-looking duck
waving his hand at me like that.

208
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,880
He meant me!

209
00:12:25,133 --> 00:12:26,658
Oh, he did?

210
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:29,036
Everybody seems to mean you!

211
00:12:31,538 --> 00:12:34,085
- See here, are you
engaged to anybody?
- No!

212
00:12:35,697 --> 00:12:37,265
You certainly seem to
know a good many people!

213
00:12:37,561 --> 00:12:41,294
Papa does. He used to live
in this town before I was born.

214
00:12:41,591 --> 00:12:44,052
- Where do you live now?
- We've lived all over.

215
00:12:44,858 --> 00:12:48,674
What do you keep moving around
so for? Is he a...promoter?

216
00:12:48,928 --> 00:12:50,370
No, he's an inventor.

217
00:12:51,222 --> 00:12:52,492
Oh? What's he invented?

218
00:12:52,746 --> 00:12:54,018
- Georgie.
- Grandfather.

219
00:12:54,275 --> 00:12:57,879
Just lately he's been working on
a new kind of horseless carriage.

220
00:12:58,133 --> 00:13:02,121
Horseless carri...automobile?
Well, well.

221
00:13:02,673 --> 00:13:04,962
Don't you approve of
them, Mr. Minafer?

222
00:13:05,218 --> 00:13:08,015
Oh, yes...they're all right.

223
00:13:09,034 --> 00:13:11,284
You know, I'm just
beginning to understand.

224
00:13:11,536 --> 00:13:13,147
Understand what? What?

225
00:13:15,906 --> 00:13:18,619
What it means to be a real
Amberson in this town.

226
00:13:18,874 --> 00:13:22,903
Papa told me something about
it before we came, but I see
he didn't say half enough.

227
00:13:23,158 --> 00:13:25,872
Did your father say he knew
the family before he left here?

228
00:13:26,127 --> 00:13:29,606
I don't think he meant
to boast of it. He spoke
of it quite calmly.

229
00:13:29,861 --> 00:13:31,769
Most girls are
usually pretty fresh.

230
00:13:32,023 --> 00:13:36,900
They oughta go to a man's college
for about a year. Men get taught
a few things about freshness.

231
00:13:37,537 --> 00:13:39,190
Look here, who sent
you those flowers

232
00:13:39,234 --> 00:13:40,888
you keep making
such a fuss over?

233
00:13:42,459 --> 00:13:43,898
- Lucy.
- He did.
- Who's he?

234
00:13:44,153 --> 00:13:46,952
- The queer-looking duck.
- I've come for that dance!

235
00:13:47,547 --> 00:13:52,552
Oh, him...I suppose
he's some old widower.
Heh; some old widower!

236
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:54,205
Yes, he is a widower!

237
00:13:54,461 --> 00:13:55,818
I ought to have told you before.

238
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,177
He's my father.

239
00:13:58,024 --> 00:13:59,298
Oh.

240
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:00,568
Well that's a horse on me.
If I'd known he was your...

241
00:14:00,823 --> 00:14:02,646
This is our dance.

242
00:14:03,326 --> 00:14:04,769
But I guess I won't insist on it.

243
00:14:05,023 --> 00:14:06,889
George, dear; are you
enjoying the party?

244
00:14:07,143 --> 00:14:08,416
Yes mother, very much.

245
00:14:08,672 --> 00:14:11,553
Will you please excuse us?
Miss Morgan...

246
00:14:14,904 --> 00:14:16,304
Eggnog, anybody?

247
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:17,789
Not for me, sir.

248
00:14:18,044 --> 00:14:19,993
I see that you kept
your promise, Gene.

249
00:14:20,289 --> 00:14:24,110
Isabel, I remember the
last drink Gene ever had.

250
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:27,375
Fact is, I believe if he
hadn't broken that bass fiddle,

251
00:14:27,629 --> 00:14:29,284
Isabel never would have taken Wilbur.

252
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:30,936
Heh, what do you think, Wilbur?

253
00:14:31,192 --> 00:14:35,390
I shouldn't be surprised.
If your notion's right, I'm
glad Gene broke the fiddle.

254
00:14:35,688 --> 00:14:37,723
What do you say about it, Isabel?

255
00:14:37,979 --> 00:14:41,203
By Jingo! She's blushing!

256
00:14:41,456 --> 00:14:43,236
Who wouldn't blush?

257
00:14:44,173 --> 00:14:46,123
The important thing is
that Wilbur did get her,

258
00:14:46,378 --> 00:14:48,116
and not only got her,
but kept her.

259
00:14:48,369 --> 00:14:51,042
There's another important
thing...that is, for me.

260
00:14:51,298 --> 00:14:55,032
In fact, it's the only thing
that makes me forgive that bass
viole for getting in my way.

261
00:14:56,344 --> 00:14:59,188
- Well, what's that?
- Lucy.

262
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,927
You havin' a good time?

263
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:03,216
I don't suppose you
ever gave up smoking...

264
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:04,234
No, sir.

265
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:06,609
Well, I've got some Havanas.

266
00:15:07,243 --> 00:15:09,535
Your ears don't burn, young lady?

267
00:15:09,789 --> 00:15:12,886
- Would you care for some
refreshments, Miss Morgan?
- Yes, thanks.

268
00:15:15,134 --> 00:15:16,830
What did you say your name was?

269
00:15:17,086 --> 00:15:17,976
Morgan.

270
00:15:18,273 --> 00:15:19,249
Funny name...

271
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,370
Everybody else's name always is.

272
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:23,194
I didn't mean it was really funny.

273
00:15:23,447 --> 00:15:26,501
That's just one of the crowd's
bits of horsing in college.

274
00:15:26,756 --> 00:15:28,113
I knew your last name was Morgan.

275
00:15:28,156 --> 00:15:29,472
I meant your first name.

276
00:15:29,724 --> 00:15:30,999
- Lucy.
- Well!

277
00:15:34,052 --> 00:15:35,919
Is "Lucy" a funny name, too?

278
00:15:37,995 --> 00:15:39,608
- No...Lucy's very much all right.
- Thanks.

279
00:15:39,862 --> 00:15:42,067
Here they are. Here
they are, Henry.

280
00:15:42,322 --> 00:15:43,807
- Are they?
- Thanks for what?

281
00:15:44,063 --> 00:15:46,647
Thanks about letting
my name be Lucy.

282
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:51,357
Good-bye. I've got
this dance with her.

283
00:15:51,611 --> 00:15:53,053
- With who?
- With Isabel, of course.

284
00:15:53,308 --> 00:15:55,387
18 years have passed...but have they?

285
00:15:55,642 --> 00:15:57,593
Tell me, have you danced with
poor old Fanny too, this evening?

286
00:15:57,847 --> 00:15:58,991
Twice. Wilbur...

287
00:15:59,203 --> 00:16:02,088
My gosh, old times certainly
are starting all over again...

288
00:16:02,344 --> 00:16:07,560
Not a bit! There aren't any
old times. When times are gone
they aren't old - they're dead.

289
00:16:07,815 --> 00:16:10,232
There aren't any
times but new times!

290
00:16:21,131 --> 00:16:23,677
- What are you studying in school?
- I beg your pardon?

291
00:16:23,975 --> 00:16:26,093
- What are you studying in school?
- College.
- College.

292
00:16:26,775 --> 00:16:28,513
Oh, lots of useless guff.

293
00:16:28,767 --> 00:16:30,633
Why don't you study
some useful guff?

294
00:16:30,931 --> 00:16:31,948
What do you mean "useful?"

295
00:16:32,203 --> 00:16:34,621
Something you can use later
in your business or profession.

296
00:16:34,872 --> 00:16:36,911
I don't intend to go into
any business or profession.

297
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:38,396
- No?
- No!

298
00:16:38,651 --> 00:16:39,838
Why not?

299
00:16:40,388 --> 00:16:41,618
Well...just look at them.

300
00:16:41,915 --> 00:16:43,954
That's a fine career
for a man, isn't it?

301
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:47,301
Lawyers, bankers, politicians!

302
00:16:47,557 --> 00:16:49,931
What do they ever get out
of life, I'd like to know?

303
00:16:50,569 --> 00:16:52,732
What they know about real things?

304
00:16:52,987 --> 00:16:54,812
Where do they ever get?

305
00:16:55,404 --> 00:16:57,483
What do you want to be?

306
00:16:58,287 --> 00:16:59,942
A yachtsman.

307
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:25,864
- What good are they?
They always break down!
- They do not always break down!

308
00:17:26,582 --> 00:17:28,915
Oh, of course they do!

309
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:32,984
- Horseless carriages! Automobiles!
- Hmm?

310
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:38,455
People aren't going to spend their
lives lying on their backs in the road
letting grease drip on their faces.

311
00:17:38,965 --> 00:17:41,681
No, I think your father
better forget about them.

312
00:17:42,358 --> 00:17:45,199
Papa would be so grateful if
he could have your advice.

313
00:17:45,497 --> 00:17:48,719
I don't know that I've done
anything to be insulted for.

314
00:17:49,397 --> 00:17:52,200
You know, I don't mind your
being such a lofty person at all.

315
00:17:52,451 --> 00:17:55,505
I think it's ever so interesting.
But Papa's a great man.

316
00:17:55,761 --> 00:17:58,178
Is he? Well let us hope so.

317
00:17:58,475 --> 00:18:00,384
I hope so, I'm sure.

318
00:18:07,511 --> 00:18:08,825
Hoe lovely your mother is!

319
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:10,437
I think she is.

320
00:18:10,732 --> 00:18:14,170
She's the gracefullest woman.
She dances like a girl of 16.

321
00:18:14,847 --> 00:18:17,094
Most girls of 16 are
pretty bad dancers.

322
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:18,749
Anyhow,

323
00:18:19,642 --> 00:18:22,694
I wouldn't dance with one
of them unless I had to.

324
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:25,664
Uh, the snow's fine for sleighing.

325
00:18:25,959 --> 00:18:27,869
I'll be by for you in a cutter,
ten minutes after two.

326
00:18:28,123 --> 00:18:30,117
- Tomorrow?
- (Thank you, Isabel.)
- I can't possibly go...

327
00:18:31,174 --> 00:18:35,203
- Bravo! Bravisimo!
- Papa.
- Lucy.

328
00:18:36,735 --> 00:18:38,261
I'll get your things.

329
00:18:39,957 --> 00:18:41,824
If you don't I'm going to sit
in a cutter at your front gate,

330
00:18:42,078 --> 00:18:45,003
and if you go out with
anybody else, he has to whip
me before he gets to you.

331
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:49,078
Hey, you two, I think you oughta
take this, in case you break down
in that...horseless carriage!

332
00:18:49,372 --> 00:18:51,239
- Uncle Jack!
- Take this scarf, mistress.
- Good night, Isabel.
- Come here.

333
00:18:52,555 --> 00:18:54,379
Fanny, where are you going?

334
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:55,609
Oh, just out to look.

335
00:18:55,862 --> 00:18:57,772
Think you'll be warm enough,
Lucy? Here, put this scarf on.

336
00:18:57,984 --> 00:19:00,530
- Well?
- (I will)
- Oh, nothing...

337
00:19:00,783 --> 00:19:02,564
Here, hold this.

338
00:19:02,819 --> 00:19:05,280
Who is this fellow, Morgan?

339
00:19:06,424 --> 00:19:09,394
I...he's a man with a
pretty daughter, Georgie.

340
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,895
He certainly seems to be
awfully at home, here.

341
00:19:12,149 --> 00:19:14,230
The way he was dancing with
Mother and aunt Fanny.

342
00:19:15,883 --> 00:19:18,684
Well, I'm afraid your aunt
Fanny's heart was stirred by

343
00:19:18,937 --> 00:19:21,184
Ancient recollections, Georgie.

344
00:19:21,439 --> 00:19:23,349
You mean she used to
be silly about him?

345
00:19:24,281 --> 00:19:27,165
Oh, she wasn't considered,
er, singular.

346
00:19:27,419 --> 00:19:29,880
- He was...he was popular.
- Ohh...

347
00:19:31,239 --> 00:19:34,376
Do you take the same passionate
interest in the parents of
every girl you dance with?

348
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:37,388
Oh, dry up! I only
wanted to know...

349
00:19:38,278 --> 00:19:39,934
Lucy...about that sleigh ride...
Don't go out with anybody.

350
00:19:40,229 --> 00:19:43,412
- I want to look at that automobile
carriage of yours, Gene.
- Fanny, you'll catch cold.

351
00:19:43,505 --> 00:19:46,591
- I want to ride in that thing
tomorrow, want to see if it's safe.
- Good night, Isabel.
- Good night, Eugene.

352
00:19:49,345 --> 00:19:56,271
- Got a blanket for
you here, Jeeves. Catch!
- Night!
- Bye! Bye!

353
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:05,424
Papa? Papa? Do you think
George is terrible arrogant
and domineering?

354
00:20:06,358 --> 00:20:08,562
Oh, he's still only a boy.

355
00:20:10,259 --> 00:20:12,466
Plenty of fine stuff in him.

356
00:20:13,441 --> 00:20:17,258
Can't help but be, he's...
Isabel Amberson's son.

357
00:20:20,059 --> 00:20:22,434
You liked her pretty
well once I guess, Papa.

358
00:20:24,384 --> 00:20:26,123
Do still.

359
00:20:26,548 --> 00:20:28,159
...I know that isn't
all that's worrying you.

360
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:30,321
Well, several things.

361
00:20:30,577 --> 00:20:32,784
I've been a little bothered
about your father, too.

362
00:20:33,078 --> 00:20:33,671
Why?

363
00:20:33,925 --> 00:20:36,047
It seems to me
he looks so badly.

364
00:20:36,301 --> 00:20:39,315
He isn't any different
than the way he's looked
all his life that I can see.

365
00:20:39,568 --> 00:20:42,580
He's been worried about some
investments he made last year.

366
00:20:43,004 --> 00:20:44,955
I think the worry's
affected his health.

367
00:20:45,211 --> 00:20:46,610
What investments?

368
00:20:46,864 --> 00:20:49,833
See here, he isn't going into
Morgan's automobile concern, is he?

369
00:20:50,088 --> 00:20:53,313
Oh, no. The automobile
concern is all Eugene's.

370
00:20:53,734 --> 00:20:56,068
No, your father's rolling mills...

371
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:58,402
Hello, dear.

372
00:20:58,655 --> 00:20:59,842
Have you had trouble sleeping?

373
00:21:00,095 --> 00:21:01,582
Look here, Father...

374
00:21:01,834 --> 00:21:04,252
about this man Morgan and
his old sewing machine.

375
00:21:04,506 --> 00:21:07,860
Didn't he want to get grandfather
to put some money into it?

376
00:21:08,157 --> 00:21:09,641
Isn't that what he's up to?

377
00:21:09,894 --> 00:21:11,889
You little silly! What on
earth are you talking about?

378
00:21:12,186 --> 00:21:15,877
Eugene Morgan's perfectly able to
finance his own inventions these days.

379
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:17,785
I'll bet he borrows
money from Uncle Jack.

380
00:21:17,997 --> 00:21:19,568
Georgie, why do you say such a thing?

381
00:21:20,202 --> 00:21:23,339
Just strikes me as that sort
of a man. Isn't he, Father?

382
00:21:23,597 --> 00:21:26,438
He was a fairly wild young
fellow twenty years ago.

383
00:21:26,691 --> 00:21:28,346
He's like you in one thing, Georgie.

384
00:21:28,643 --> 00:21:31,738
He spent too much money. Only
he didn't have a mother

385
00:21:32,078 --> 00:21:33,691
to get money out of a
grandfather for him.

386
00:21:33,903 --> 00:21:35,853
But I believe he's done
fairly well of late years,

387
00:21:36,107 --> 00:21:39,161
and I doubt if he needs anyone else's
money to back his horseless carriage.

388
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:41,200
Oh what's he brought the
old thing here for, then?

389
00:21:41,453 --> 00:21:44,294
I'm sure I don't know.
You might ask him.

390
00:21:44,548 --> 00:21:46,544
I'll be in to say goodnight, dear.

391
00:21:50,276 --> 00:21:50,825
Aunt Fanny.

392
00:21:51,078 --> 00:21:53,924
What in the world's
the matter with you?

393
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:58,926
I suppose you don't know why
Father doesn't want to go on that
horseless carriage trip tomorrow?

394
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:00,413
What do you mean?

395
00:22:00,709 --> 00:22:03,636
You're his only sister
and yet you don't know.

396
00:22:05,544 --> 00:22:09,320
H-he never wants to go
anywhere that I ever heard of.

397
00:22:09,956 --> 00:22:11,948
What is the matter with you?

398
00:22:12,203 --> 00:22:14,832
He doesn't want to go because
he doesn't like this man Morgan.

399
00:22:15,682 --> 00:22:17,377
Oh, good gracious!

400
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:21,789
Eugene Morgan isn't in
your Father's thoughts at
all one way or the other.

401
00:22:22,043 --> 00:22:23,145
- 'Night.
- Why should he be?
- Good night.
- Good night.

402
00:22:24,503 --> 00:22:25,097
You two at it again?

403
00:22:25,394 --> 00:22:28,915
Hey, what makes you and everybody
so excited over this man Morgan.

404
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:31,417
- This man Morgan.
- Excited!
- Oh, shut up!

405
00:22:32,902 --> 00:22:35,787
Can't...can't people be glad
to see an old friend without

406
00:22:36,041 --> 00:22:40,069
silly children like you
making a to-do about it?

407
00:22:43,378 --> 00:22:48,214
I...I've just been suggesting
to your mother that she might
give a little dinner for them.

408
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:50,036
For who?

409
00:22:50,291 --> 00:22:53,983
- "For whom", Georgie.
- "For whom, Georgie."

410
00:22:56,569 --> 00:22:59,327
For Mr. Morgan and his daughter.

411
00:23:00,387 --> 00:23:02,252
Oh, look here; don't do that.

412
00:23:02,507 --> 00:23:03,526
Mother mustn't do that.

413
00:23:03,823 --> 00:23:05,476
"Mother mustn't do that."

414
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:08,147
- It wouldn't look well.
- "Wouldn't look..."

415
00:23:10,354 --> 00:23:12,177
See here, George Minafer...

416
00:23:12,433 --> 00:23:13,875
I suggest

417
00:23:14,511 --> 00:23:17,948
that you just march
straight on into your room!

418
00:23:18,371 --> 00:23:21,170
Sometimes you say things that show
you have a pretty mean little mind!

419
00:23:21,425 --> 00:23:23,038
What upset you this much?

420
00:23:23,631 --> 00:23:25,964
- (Shut up!)
- I know what you mean!

421
00:23:26,219 --> 00:23:30,077
You're trying to insinuate that
I'd get your mother to invite
Eugene Morgan here on my account!

422
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:31,901
(I'm gonna move to a hotel!)

423
00:23:32,115 --> 00:23:33,556
Because he's a widower.

424
00:23:33,809 --> 00:23:35,124
- What?
- What!
- Huh huh huh
- "Heh heh heh heh heh"

425
00:23:38,646 --> 00:23:42,121
I'm trying to insinuate you're
setting your cap for him,

426
00:23:42,378 --> 00:23:44,033
and getting Mother to help you?

427
00:23:44,413 --> 00:23:46,109
- Ohh!
- Is that what you mean?

428
00:23:50,265 --> 00:23:52,176
You attend your own affairs!

429
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:55,228
Well! I will be shot!

430
00:23:55,994 --> 00:23:57,264
I will.

431
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,938
- I certainly will be shot.
- (Oh!)
- Ohh.

432
00:24:11,093 --> 00:24:13,510
You think you'll get it to start?

433
00:24:23,097 --> 00:24:24,623
What's wrong with it, Gene?

434
00:24:24,836 --> 00:24:26,658
I wish I knew!

435
00:25:00,889 --> 00:25:03,729
Get a horse!
Get a horse!

436
00:25:11,212 --> 00:25:13,415
- Look out, Lucy!
- What happened to them?

437
00:25:14,262 --> 00:25:16,467
- Oh, George!
- Don't get excited, Isabel.

438
00:25:25,237 --> 00:25:27,869
- Are you all right?
- (Georgie!)

439
00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:30,917
They're all right, Isabel.
The snow bank's a feather bed.

440
00:25:31,339 --> 00:25:33,969
- Georgie!
- Lucy dear!
- Oh, I'm fine, Papa.

441
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:37,747
- Nothing's the matter with them now.
- They're all right, Isabel.

442
00:25:38,045 --> 00:25:40,378
Are you sure you're
not hurt, Lucy dear?

443
00:25:40,927 --> 00:25:43,685
- Don't make a fuss, mother.
- Georgie, that terrible fall.

444
00:25:43,867 --> 00:25:44,704
Please Mother, please!
I'm all right.

445
00:25:45,636 --> 00:25:48,691
Are you sure, Georgie? Sometimes
one doesn't realize...the shock.

446
00:25:49,065 --> 00:25:50,723
- Oh, Isabel.
- I've just got to be sure, dear.

447
00:25:53,824 --> 00:25:55,646
- Everything's all right,
Mother. Nothing's the matter.
- Let me brush you off, dear.

448
00:25:55,856 --> 00:25:59,713
- You looked pretty surprised,
Lucy. All that snow becomes you!
- That's right, it does!

449
00:26:01,415 --> 00:26:02,985
That darned horse!

450
00:26:03,283 --> 00:26:05,741
He'll be home long before we will.

451
00:26:05,997 --> 00:26:09,008
All we've got to depend on
is Gene Morgan's broken down...

452
00:26:10,707 --> 00:26:13,715
- She'll go.
- Come on, asshole!
- All aboard!

453
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:17,577
Have to sit on my lap, Lucy!

454
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:20,628
Stamp the snow. You
mustn't ride with wet feet.

455
00:26:20,884 --> 00:26:21,860
They're not wet.

456
00:26:22,112 --> 00:26:25,634
- For goodness sake, get in; you're
standing in the snow yourself.
- Get in!

457
00:26:25,888 --> 00:26:29,453
You're the same Isabel I used to know.
You're a divine and ridiculous woman.

458
00:26:30,301 --> 00:26:33,227
George, you'll push if we
get started, won't you?

459
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:34,753
Push!

460
00:26:35,008 --> 00:26:38,486
Divine and ridiculous just
counterbalance each other, don't they?

461
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:41,709
Plus one and minus
one equal nothing.

462
00:26:42,006 --> 00:26:43,703
So you mean I'm nothing in particular?

463
00:26:43,956 --> 00:26:46,884
No, that doesn't seem to
be precisely what I meant.

464
00:26:47,181 --> 00:26:48,198
Jack, please get...

465
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:51,676
- We're under way...
- ...For fear of accident.

466
00:26:59,991 --> 00:27:01,517
Push, Georgie; push!

467
00:27:01,941 --> 00:27:03,171
I'm pushing.

468
00:27:03,893 --> 00:27:05,165
Push harder!

469
00:27:26,585 --> 00:27:27,689
Push, Georgie; push!

470
00:27:27,942 --> 00:27:29,426
What do you think I'm doing?

471
00:27:32,947 --> 00:27:36,638
Your father wanted to prove
that a horseless carriage
would run even in the snow.

472
00:27:36,891 --> 00:27:40,371
It really does too, you
know. It's so interesting.

473
00:27:41,007 --> 00:27:44,187
He says he's going to have
wheels all made of rubber,

474
00:27:44,441 --> 00:27:48,132
and blown up with air. I
should think they'd explode,

475
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:50,380
But Eugene seems
very confident that...

476
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,857
Oh, it seems so like old
times to hear him talk.

477
00:27:54,493 --> 00:27:57,548
"You broke the bank at
Monte Carlo..."

478
00:27:57,972 --> 00:27:59,541
Hooray; we're off!

479
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:16,804
George, you tried to
swing underneath me

480
00:28:17,102 --> 00:28:19,349
and break the fall for
me when we went over.

481
00:28:19,646 --> 00:28:21,808
I knew you were doing
that. It was nice of you.

482
00:28:22,021 --> 00:28:25,374
Wasn't much of a fall to
speak of. How about that kiss?

483
00:28:26,558 --> 00:28:27,917
You will hear them sigh

484
00:28:28,215 --> 00:28:30,547
and wish to die

485
00:28:30,801 --> 00:28:34,917
and see 'em wink the other eye, the
man who broke the bank at Monte Carlo.

486
00:28:35,298 --> 00:28:36,994
As I walked along

487
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:40,684
the Bois de Boulogne with
an independent air...

488
00:29:59,599 --> 00:30:01,018
Wilbur Minafer,

2
00:30:02,142 --> 00:30:03,352
quiet man.

3
00:30:04,688 --> 00:30:07,231
Town will hardly know he's gone.

4
00:30:18,281 --> 00:30:19,865
Where did Isabel go to?

5
00:30:20,367 --> 00:30:21,661
She was tired.

6
00:30:22,329 --> 00:30:24,664
Never was becoming to
her to look pale.

7
00:30:25,416 --> 00:30:26,418
Look out.

8
00:30:26,874 --> 00:30:27,916
Oh, boy...

9
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:30,963
- Strawberry shortcake!
- It's the first this season.

10
00:30:31,712 --> 00:30:33,130
I hope it's big enough.

11
00:30:34,005 --> 00:30:35,881
- You must know I'm coming home.
- Mmm.

12
00:30:37,801 --> 00:30:38,884
What did you say?

13
00:30:39,342 --> 00:30:40,344
Nothing.

14
00:30:43,847 --> 00:30:45,932
- Sweet enough?
- Fine.

15
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:51,020
I suppose your mother's been...

16
00:30:51,439 --> 00:30:53,314
pretty gay at the commencement.

17
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:55,649
Going a lot?

18
00:30:56,609 --> 00:30:58,276
How could she, she's in mourning.

19
00:30:58,776 --> 00:31:00,944
All she could do was sit
around and look on.

20
00:31:01,237 --> 00:31:03,948
- That's all Lucy could
do really, for that matter.
- How did Lucy get home?

21
00:31:04,993 --> 00:31:06,866
On the train; we rushed over.

22
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:09,453
Quit balling your food.

23
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:21,337
Did you drive out to their house
with her before you came here?

24
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:23,758
No.

25
00:31:24,425 --> 00:31:26,093
She went home with her father.

26
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:29,179
Oh, I see.

27
00:31:30,807 --> 00:31:33,015
Don't eat so fast, George.

28
00:31:37,351 --> 00:31:38,310
So, ah...

29
00:31:40,439 --> 00:31:42,940
Eugene came to the station to meet you?

30
00:31:44,568 --> 00:31:45,819
Meet us?

31
00:31:47,403 --> 00:31:48,697
How could he?

32
00:31:50,239 --> 00:31:52,117
I don't know what you mean.

33
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:57,203
Want some more milk?

34
00:31:57,454 --> 00:31:58,538
No, thanks.

35
00:32:02,209 --> 00:32:05,126
I haven't seen him while
your mother's been away.

36
00:32:05,877 --> 00:32:08,339
Naturally; he's beneath himself.

37
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,257
Did you see him?

38
00:32:11,759 --> 00:32:14,011
Naturally, since he made
the trip home with us.

39
00:32:14,845 --> 00:32:17,138
He did? He was with
you all the time?

40
00:32:19,348 --> 00:32:22,226
Un-uh. Only on the train, in the
last three day before we left.

41
00:32:22,434 --> 00:32:24,105
Uncle Jack got him to come along.

42
00:32:24,602 --> 00:32:26,020
You're gonna get fat.

43
00:32:26,562 --> 00:32:28,063
Mm, I can't help that.

44
00:32:28,607 --> 00:32:30,817
You're such a wonderful housekeeper.

45
00:32:31,776 --> 00:32:34,237
- You certainly know how to
make things taste good.
- Mmmm.

46
00:32:35,029 --> 00:32:37,781
I don't think you'd stay single
very long if some of these bachelors

47
00:32:37,988 --> 00:32:40,199
- or widowers around
town for just one...
- It's a little odd.

48
00:32:43,078 --> 00:32:44,204
What's odd?

49
00:32:44,996 --> 00:32:48,289
Your mother's not mentioning
that Mr. Morgan had been with you.

50
00:32:48,541 --> 00:32:50,210
Didn't think of it, I suppose.

51
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:53,295
- But I'll tell you
something in confidence...
- What?

52
00:32:53,546 --> 00:32:57,214
Well it struck me that
Mr. Morgan looked pretty
absent-minded most of the time.

53
00:32:57,465 --> 00:32:59,425
And he's certainly dressing
better than he used to.

54
00:33:00,676 --> 00:33:02,802
Oh he...he's isn't dressing
better, he's dressing up.

55
00:33:04,011 --> 00:33:06,559
Fanny, you oughta be a
little encouraging when a

56
00:33:06,809 --> 00:33:10,102
prized bachelor begins to
show by his haberdashery

57
00:33:10,688 --> 00:33:12,228
what he wants you to think about him.

58
00:33:12,479 --> 00:33:14,147
Jacks tells me that the
factory's been doing quite well.

59
00:33:14,397 --> 00:33:15,899
- Quite well?
- Honestly, Aunt Fanny...
- Why listen, you changed that...

60
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:18,861
I shouldn't be a bit surprised
to have him request an interview

61
00:33:19,151 --> 00:33:20,901
and declare that his
intentions are honourable.

62
00:33:21,196 --> 00:33:22,863
And ask my permission to
pay his addresses to you.

63
00:33:22,904 --> 00:33:24,574
What had I better tell him?

64
00:33:27,408 --> 00:33:28,617
Oh, Aunt Fanny.

65
00:33:28,825 --> 00:33:31,954
- Oh, Fanny, we were only teasing.
- Oh, let me alone!

66
00:33:32,204 --> 00:33:34,040
- Please, Fanny.
- We didn't mean anything.
- Let go of me! Please!

67
00:33:34,291 --> 00:33:37,961
- I didn't know you'd got
so sensitive as all this.
- Please, let me alone!

68
00:33:46,384 --> 00:33:49,262
It's getting so you can't joke
with her about anything anymore.

69
00:33:50,679 --> 00:33:53,515
It all began when we found out
that Father's estate was all washed

70
00:33:53,765 --> 00:33:55,975
up and he didn't leave anything.

71
00:33:57,394 --> 00:34:00,396
I thought she'd fell better when
we turned over his insurance to her.

72
00:34:01,565 --> 00:34:04,108
Gave it to her absolutely
without any strings to it.

73
00:34:04,859 --> 00:34:05,942
But, now...I dunno...

74
00:34:07,613 --> 00:34:08,571
Yeah.

75
00:34:11,363 --> 00:34:13,074
I think maybe we've been...

76
00:34:13,824 --> 00:34:15,909
teasing her about the wrong things.

77
00:34:17,869 --> 00:34:20,122
Fanny hasn't got much in her life.

78
00:34:23,833 --> 00:34:26,460
You know George, just
being an aunt isn't...

79
00:34:26,918 --> 00:34:29,965
really the great career it
may sometimes seem to be.

80
00:34:32,466 --> 00:34:35,009
I really don't know of
anything much Fanny has got.

81
00:34:36,053 --> 00:34:38,097
Except her feeling about Eugene.

82
00:34:45,062 --> 00:34:47,687
We're now turning out a
car and a quarter a day.

83
00:34:47,897 --> 00:34:50,316
- Isn't that marvelous?
- What's marvelous?

84
00:34:50,608 --> 00:34:53,026
They're turning out a
car and a quarter a day.

85
00:34:55,319 --> 00:34:56,322
Mother...

86
00:34:56,823 --> 00:34:59,573
All this noise and smell
seems to be good for you.

87
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:02,284
You oughta come here every
time you get the blues.

88
00:35:02,535 --> 00:35:04,578
She never gets the blues, George.

89
00:35:04,829 --> 00:35:07,248
I never knew a person of
a more even disposition.

90
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:10,125
- No, it's this place.
- I wish I could be more like that.

91
00:35:10,331 --> 00:35:14,044
Wouldn't anybody be delighted
to see an old friend take an

92
00:35:14,336 --> 00:35:16,713
idea out of the air like that? An
idea most people laughed at him for.

93
00:35:17,132 --> 00:35:20,300
And turn it to such a splendid
humming thing as this factory.

94
00:35:20,802 --> 00:35:21,969
Do you remember this?

95
00:35:23,678 --> 00:35:25,180
Our first machine.

96
00:35:25,556 --> 00:35:27,641
The original Morgan Invincible.

97
00:35:27,891 --> 00:35:29,101
I remember.

98
00:35:29,850 --> 00:35:31,101
How quaint!

99
00:35:31,435 --> 00:35:33,063
Of course I'm happy...

100
00:35:33,314 --> 00:35:36,773
- so very, very happy.
- Just look at the Morgan
now, Mrs. Minafer.

101
00:35:37,024 --> 00:35:38,151
It's beautiful.

102
00:35:38,568 --> 00:35:39,902
Just beautiful.

103
00:35:41,026 --> 00:35:42,987
Did you ever see
anything so lovely?

104
00:35:43,237 --> 00:35:46,364
- As what?
- As you mother. She's a darling!

105
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:50,619
And Papa looks as if he
were either going to explode,
or to utter loud sobs.

106
00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:52,371
It's just glorious.

107
00:35:53,206 --> 00:35:55,247
It makes us all happy, Eugene.

108
00:35:55,584 --> 00:35:57,291
Give him your hand, Fanny.

109
00:35:58,334 --> 00:36:01,003
There. If brother Jack were here,

110
00:36:01,214 --> 00:36:03,172
Eugene would have his three
oldest and best friends

111
00:36:03,214 --> 00:36:05,173
congratulating him all at once.

112
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,344
We know what brother Jack
thinks about it, though.

113
00:36:09,553 --> 00:36:12,220
I used to write verse
about 20 years ago,

114
00:36:12,597 --> 00:36:15,224
- remember that?
- I remember that, too.

115
00:36:16,141 --> 00:36:18,435
I'm almost thinking
I could do it again...

116
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:23,356
to thank you for making a factory
visit into such a kind celebration.

117
00:36:31,364 --> 00:36:32,573
Isabel, dear...

118
00:36:33,656 --> 00:36:34,867
Yes, Eugene.

119
00:36:35,325 --> 00:36:37,286
Don't you think you
should tell George?

120
00:36:38,496 --> 00:36:40,537
- About us?
- Yes.

121
00:36:42,999 --> 00:36:44,541
There's still time.

122
00:36:45,542 --> 00:36:47,086
I think he should hear it from you.

123
00:36:49,254 --> 00:36:50,756
He will, dearest.

124
00:36:52,633 --> 00:36:53,592
Soon...

125
00:36:56,886 --> 00:36:57,930
Soon.

126
00:37:07,478 --> 00:37:09,522
I'll still take a horse any day.

127
00:37:16,863 --> 00:37:18,656
- Wo.
- Oh, don't.
- Why?

128
00:37:18,989 --> 00:37:20,616
Do you want him to
trot his legs off?

129
00:37:20,908 --> 00:37:22,450
- No, but...
- "No but" what?

130
00:37:22,951 --> 00:37:26,663
I know when you make him walk
it's so you can give all your
attention to proposing to me again.

131
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:30,040
- George, do let Pendennis trot again.
- I won't.

132
00:37:30,291 --> 00:37:33,168
Get up, Pendennis. Go
on, trot! Commence!

133
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:34,546
Ah, Lucy,

134
00:37:34,877 --> 00:37:37,087
if you aren't the prettiest
thing in this world.

135
00:37:37,381 --> 00:37:39,507
When are you going to
say we're really engaged?

136
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:43,802
Not for years. So
there's the answer.

137
00:37:44,803 --> 00:37:45,805
Lucy!

138
00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:48,057
Dear, what's the matter?

139
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:50,517
You look as if you're going to cry.

140
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:54,939
You always do that, whenever I can
get you to talk about marrying me.

141
00:37:55,187 --> 00:37:57,648
- I know it.
- Well why do you?

142
00:37:58,398 --> 00:38:02,069
One reason's because...I have
a feeling it's never going to be.

143
00:38:02,319 --> 00:38:04,779
- You haven't any reason or...
- It's just a feeling.

144
00:38:05,741 --> 00:38:06,865
I don't know...

145
00:38:07,614 --> 00:38:09,533
Everything's so unsettled.

146
00:38:09,993 --> 00:38:13,204
If you aren't the queerest
girl. What's unsettled?

147
00:38:13,581 --> 00:38:15,122
Well for one thing, George,

148
00:38:15,373 --> 00:38:17,332
you haven't decided on
anything to do yet.

149
00:38:17,583 --> 00:38:19,541
Or at least if you have,
you've never spoken of it.

150
00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:22,713
Lucy, haven't you perfectly
well understood that I don't

151
00:38:23,005 --> 00:38:25,839
intend to go into a business
or adopt a profession?

152
00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:27,969
Well what are you going to do, George?

153
00:38:28,509 --> 00:38:30,969
Why, I expect to lead
an honorable life.

154
00:38:31,469 --> 00:38:34,223
I expect to contribute my
share to charities,

155
00:38:34,432 --> 00:38:36,893
and take part in,
well in, movements.

156
00:38:37,141 --> 00:38:39,311
- What kind?
- Whatever appeals to me.

157
00:38:40,145 --> 00:38:42,272
I should like to revert to the
questions I was asking you,

158
00:38:42,521 --> 00:38:44,192
- if you don't mind.
- No, George...

159
00:38:44,442 --> 00:38:46,818
- I think you'd better...
- Your father's a businessman
- He's a mechanical genius.

160
00:38:47,067 --> 00:38:48,903
- It is your father's idea...
- Or he's both.

161
00:38:48,953 --> 00:38:52,255
isn't it your father's idea that I
ought to go into business and you
oughtn't to be engaged to me until I do?

162
00:38:52,406 --> 00:38:54,907
No, I've never once
spoken to him about it.

163
00:38:55,159 --> 00:38:57,368
But you know that's the
way he does feel about it?

164
00:38:57,617 --> 00:38:58,660
Yes.

165
00:38:59,037 --> 00:39:01,287
Do you think that I'd be
very much of a man if I let

166
00:39:01,538 --> 00:39:03,958
another man dictate to
me my own way of life?

167
00:39:04,209 --> 00:39:06,168
George! Who's dictating
your way of life?

168
00:39:06,419 --> 00:39:09,128
I don't believe in the whole
world...scrubbing dishes,

169
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:12,423
selling potatoes or
trying law cases.

170
00:39:14,174 --> 00:39:16,341
No, I dare say I don't care
any more for your father's

171
00:39:16,592 --> 00:39:18,555
ideals than he does for mine.

172
00:39:18,845 --> 00:39:20,680
- George?
- Giddap, Pendennis!

173
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:26,395
Well, seems to have recovered.

174
00:39:27,145 --> 00:39:28,978
Looks the highest good spirits.

175
00:39:29,355 --> 00:39:31,565
- I beg pardon?
- Your grandson.

176
00:39:32,484 --> 00:39:34,984
Last night he seemed
inclined to melancholy.

177
00:39:35,235 --> 00:39:36,318
What about?

178
00:39:38,156 --> 00:39:42,118
Not getting remorseful about all the
money he spent in college, is he?

179
00:39:43,284 --> 00:39:46,787
- I wonder what he thinks I'm made of.
- Gold.

180
00:39:47,497 --> 00:39:49,578
And he's right about
that part of you, Father.

181
00:39:49,873 --> 00:39:52,085
- What part?
- Your heart.

182
00:39:54,168 --> 00:39:56,962
I suppose that may account
for how heavy it feels

183
00:39:57,211 --> 00:39:58,880
nowadays, sometimes.

184
00:40:00,882 --> 00:40:03,136
This town seems to be
rolling right over

185
00:40:03,387 --> 00:40:05,846
that old heart you
mentioned just now, Jack.

186
00:40:06,596 --> 00:40:09,598
Rolling over it and
burying it under.

187
00:40:16,023 --> 00:40:18,691
- I miss my best girl.
- We all do.

188
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:21,693
Lucy's on a visit, father. She's
spending a week with a school friend.

189
00:40:22,316 --> 00:40:23,528
She'll be back Monday.

190
00:40:23,736 --> 00:40:26,780
George, how does it happen
you didn't tell us before?

191
00:40:27,448 --> 00:40:30,074
You never said a word to
us about Lucy's going away.

192
00:40:30,325 --> 00:40:31,452
Probably afraid to.

193
00:40:31,702 --> 00:40:34,873
He didn't know that what
he might break down and cry
if he tried to speak of it.

194
00:40:35,124 --> 00:40:36,956
Isn't that so, Georgie?

195
00:40:37,205 --> 00:40:39,916
- Or didn't Lucy tell you she was going?
- She told me.

196
00:40:40,167 --> 00:40:42,130
At any rate, Georgie didn't approve.

197
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:44,837
I suppose you two aren't speaking again?

198
00:40:46,131 --> 00:40:47,922
Gene, what's this I hear
about someone else opening up

199
00:40:47,967 --> 00:40:49,717
another horseless carriage
shop, somewhere

200
00:40:49,967 --> 00:40:53,220
- out in the suburbs?
- Ah, I suppose they'll
drive you out of business,

201
00:40:53,512 --> 00:40:58,019
or else the two of you'll get together and
drive all the rest of us off of the streets!

202
00:40:58,268 --> 00:41:01,018
Well, we'll even things up by
making the streets bigger.

203
00:41:01,268 --> 00:41:04,562
Automobiles will carry our streets
clear out to the county line.

204
00:41:04,774 --> 00:41:07,526
Well I hope you're wrong, because
if people go to moving that far,

205
00:41:07,735 --> 00:41:11,863
real estate values here in
the old residence part of town
will be stretched pretty thin.

206
00:41:12,237 --> 00:41:16,199
So your devilish machines are going
to ruin all your old friends, eh Gene?

207
00:41:16,491 --> 00:41:19,454
You really think they're going
to change the face of the land?

208
00:41:19,743 --> 00:41:22,247
They're already doing it, Major,
and it can't be stopped.

209
00:41:22,538 --> 00:41:25,332
- Automobiles are...
- Automobiles are a useless nuisance.

210
00:41:28,837 --> 00:41:30,546
What did you say George?

211
00:41:30,839 --> 00:41:33,256
I said automobiles are
a useless nuisance.

212
00:41:33,549 --> 00:41:36,593
Nothing amount to anything
but a nuisance, and they had
no business to be invented.

213
00:41:36,968 --> 00:41:39,180
Course you forget
Mr. Morgan makes them.

214
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:41,638
Also did his share in inventing them.

215
00:41:42,639 --> 00:41:44,973
If you weren't so thoughtless, he
might think you rather offensive.

216
00:41:48,688 --> 00:41:51,606
I'm not sure that George
is wrong about automobiles.

217
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:55,151
With all their speed forward, they

218
00:41:55,444 --> 00:41:57,778
may be a step backward in civilization.

219
00:41:59,490 --> 00:42:02,242
May be that they won't add
to the beauty of the world,

220
00:42:02,533 --> 00:42:04,283
or the life of men's souls.

221
00:42:04,618 --> 00:42:05,828
I'm not sure.

222
00:42:07,162 --> 00:42:08,997
But automobiles have come.

223
00:42:10,415 --> 00:42:14,417
And almost all outward things
are going to be different
because of what they bring.

224
00:42:16,004 --> 00:42:19,297
They're going to alter war and
they're going to alter peace.

225
00:42:20,801 --> 00:42:23,925
And I think men's minds are going
to be changed in subtle ways

226
00:42:24,175 --> 00:42:25,679
because of automobiles.

227
00:42:27,304 --> 00:42:28,847
And it may be that George is right.

228
00:42:31,017 --> 00:42:32,517
Maybe, that in

229
00:42:32,728 --> 00:42:35,936
10 or 20 years from now, if
we can see the inward change

230
00:42:36,186 --> 00:42:37,857
in men by that time,

231
00:42:38,647 --> 00:42:42,609
I shouldn't be able to defend
the gasoline engine, but would
have to agree with George,

232
00:42:43,778 --> 00:42:45,237
that automobiles had no business

233
00:42:45,279 --> 00:42:46,740
to be invented.

234
00:42:53,161 --> 00:42:54,162
Well Major,

235
00:42:54,829 --> 00:42:56,956
if you'll excuse me. Fanny.

236
00:42:57,165 --> 00:42:58,957
- Oh Eugene, ple...
- Isabel.

237
00:42:59,333 --> 00:43:01,375
Got to run down to the shop
and speak to the foreman.

238
00:43:01,626 --> 00:43:04,421
- I'll see you to the door.
- Don't bother sir, I know the way.

239
00:43:04,671 --> 00:43:05,795
I'll come to.

240
00:43:23,395 --> 00:43:26,774
- Georgie dear, what did you mean?
- Just what I said.

241
00:43:28,399 --> 00:43:29,609
He was hurt.

242
00:43:30,277 --> 00:43:33,738
I...don't see why he should be.
I didn't say anything about him.

243
00:43:34,322 --> 00:43:37,157
Didn't seem to me to be hurt,
he seemed perfectly cheerful.

244
00:43:37,658 --> 00:43:39,496
What made you think he was hurt?

245
00:43:40,412 --> 00:43:41,579
I know him.

246
00:43:51,089 --> 00:43:54,715
- By Jove, Georgie; you are a puzzle!
- In what way, may I ask?

247
00:43:54,964 --> 00:43:57,801
Well, it's a new style, courting
a pretty girl I must say for a

248
00:43:58,053 --> 00:44:00,929
young fellow to go deliberately
out of his way to try and
make an enemy of her father,

249
00:44:01,179 --> 00:44:03,349
by attacking his businesses!

250
00:44:03,973 --> 00:44:05,140
By Jove!

251
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:07,813
It's a new way of winning a woman.

252
00:44:16,485 --> 00:44:17,527
George!

253
00:44:17,777 --> 00:44:20,363
You struck just the right
treatment to adopt, you're
doing just the right thing.

254
00:44:20,612 --> 00:44:23,199
- Oh, what do you want?
- Her father would thank you if
he could see what you're doing.

255
00:44:23,490 --> 00:44:25,783
Quit the mysterious detective
business. You make me dizzy.

256
00:44:26,033 --> 00:44:27,995
You don't care to hear that I
approve of what you're doing?

257
00:44:28,245 --> 00:44:30,122
For the gosh sakes, what in
the world is wrong with you?

258
00:44:30,414 --> 00:44:32,708
Oh, you're always picking on me, always

259
00:44:32,957 --> 00:44:35,168
- Ever since you were a little boy!
- Oh my gosh!

260
00:44:35,461 --> 00:44:37,545
You wouldn't treat anybody in the
world like this except old Fanny!

261
00:44:37,795 --> 00:44:40,589
"Old Fanny", you'd say, "It's nobody
but old Fanny, so I'll kick her."

262
00:44:40,841 --> 00:44:43,217
"Nobody'll resent it, so
I'll kick her all I want to."

263
00:44:43,508 --> 00:44:47,470
And you're right. I haven't got
anything in the world since my
brother died. Nobody, nothing...

264
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:50,179
- Oh my gosh!
- I never never in the world
would have told you about it,

265
00:44:50,473 --> 00:44:53,851
or even made the faintest reference
to it if I hadn't seen
that somebody else had told you

266
00:44:54,101 --> 00:44:57,101
- or you found out for
yourself in some way.
- Somebody else had told me what?

267
00:44:57,396 --> 00:44:59,397
How people are talking about your mother.

268
00:45:06,653 --> 00:45:07,987
What did you say?

269
00:45:08,239 --> 00:45:11,995
Of course, I understood what
you were doing when you
started being rude to Eugene.

270
00:45:12,244 --> 00:45:15,994
I knew you'd give Lucy up in a
minute if it came to a question
of your mother's reputation.

271
00:45:16,244 --> 00:45:18,539
- Look here!
- Because you said...
- Look here! Just what do you mean?

272
00:45:18,832 --> 00:45:22,249
I only wanted to say that I'm
sorry for you, George, that's all.

273
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:25,503
But it's only old Fanny,
so whatever she says,
pick on her for it.

274
00:45:25,754 --> 00:45:27,715
Hammer her! Hammer her...

275
00:45:28,006 --> 00:45:30,885
- Jack said...
- It's only poor old lonely Fanny!

276
00:45:31,135 --> 00:45:33,513
Uncle Jack said if there was
any gossip it was about you!

277
00:45:33,763 --> 00:45:36,388
He said people might be laughing
about the way you ran
after Morgan, but that was all!

278
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:38,351
Oh yes, it's always Fanny!

279
00:45:38,601 --> 00:45:41,559
- Ridiculous old Fanny! Always! Always!
- Listen!

280
00:45:41,934 --> 00:45:44,895
You said mother let him come here just
on your account, and now you say...

281
00:45:45,147 --> 00:45:48,025
He did! Anyhow, he liked to
dance with me. He danced with me

282
00:45:48,276 --> 00:45:49,899
as much as he did with her.

283
00:45:50,150 --> 00:45:52,528
You told me mother never saw him
except when she was chaperoning you.

284
00:45:52,819 --> 00:45:54,989
Well you don't suppose that
stops people from talking, do you?

285
00:45:56,281 --> 00:45:58,076
They just thought I didn't count!

286
00:45:58,575 --> 00:46:00,952
"It's only Fanny Minafer",
I suppose they'd say.

287
00:46:01,535 --> 00:46:04,082
Besides, everybody knew
he'd been engaged to her.

288
00:46:04,498 --> 00:46:06,291
- What's that?
- Everybody knows it. Everybody

289
00:46:06,541 --> 00:46:09,919
in this town knows that
Isabel never really cared
for any other man in her life.

290
00:46:10,169 --> 00:46:14,131
I believe I'm going crazy.
You mean you lied when you
told me there wasn't any talk?

291
00:46:14,382 --> 00:46:16,298
Oh it never would have amounted
to anything if Wilbur had lived.

292
00:46:16,550 --> 00:46:18,217
You mean Morgan might have married you?

293
00:46:18,469 --> 00:46:19,468
No.

294
00:46:20,134 --> 00:46:22,053
Because I don't know that
I'd have accepted him.

295
00:46:22,303 --> 00:46:24,639
Are you trying to tell me
that because he comes here

296
00:46:24,932 --> 00:46:27,017
and they see her with him,
driving and all that,

297
00:46:27,309 --> 00:46:29,686
they think that they were right
in saying that she was...

298
00:46:30,062 --> 00:46:32,105
she was in love with him before...

299
00:46:32,355 --> 00:46:34,189
before my father died?

300
00:46:34,524 --> 00:46:35,652
Why, George!

301
00:46:36,109 --> 00:46:38,276
Don't you know that's what they say?

302
00:46:38,651 --> 00:46:40,904
You must know that everybody in town...

303
00:46:41,154 --> 00:46:42,447
- Who told you?
- What?

304
00:46:42,657 --> 00:46:45,700
Who told you there was talk?
Where is this talk? Where does
it come from? Who does it!

305
00:46:45,991 --> 00:46:48,160
Why, I suppose pretty much everybody
I know. It's pretty general.

306
00:46:48,412 --> 00:46:50,577
- Who said so?
- Wha?
- How did you get hold
of it? You answer me!

307
00:46:50,872 --> 00:46:52,708
- Well I hardly think it
would be fair to give names.
- Look here.

308
00:46:52,998 --> 00:46:55,711
One of your best friends
is that mother of Charlie
Johnson's across the way.

309
00:46:56,002 --> 00:46:58,130
- Has she ever mentioned this to you?
- Well she may have intimated it...

310
00:46:58,336 --> 00:47:00,340
- You and she have been
talking about it! Do you deny it?
- Why George...

311
00:47:00,590 --> 00:47:03,966
- Do you deny it?
- She's a very kind discreet
woman, but she may have intimated...

312
00:47:04,174 --> 00:47:05,175
George!

313
00:47:07,304 --> 00:47:09,015
What are you going to do, George?

314
00:47:10,514 --> 00:47:11,974
Mr. Amberson...

315
00:47:12,558 --> 00:47:14,434
Heh heh, I mean Mr. Minafer.

316
00:47:14,683 --> 00:47:16,812
- Won't you come in, please.
- Thank you.

317
00:47:17,061 --> 00:47:19,980
Well! How nice to
see you, Mr. Minafer.

318
00:47:20,273 --> 00:47:21,522
Mrs. Johnson...

319
00:47:24,609 --> 00:47:27,864
Mrs. Johnson, I have come
to ask you a few questions.

320
00:47:28,112 --> 00:47:30,657
Certainly, Mr. Minafer,
anything I can do for you.

321
00:47:30,947 --> 00:47:32,908
I don't mean to waste
any time, Mrs. Johnson.

322
00:47:33,950 --> 00:47:36,578
You...you were talking
about a...a scandal

323
00:47:36,994 --> 00:47:39,040
that involved my mother's name!

324
00:47:39,246 --> 00:47:40,291
Mr. Minafer!

325
00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:42,917
My aunt told me that you
repeated the scandal to her.

326
00:47:43,832 --> 00:47:46,463
I don't think your aunt
can have said that.

327
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:51,091
We may have discussed some
few matters that have been a
topic of comment about town.

328
00:47:51,342 --> 00:47:54,845
- Yes, I think you may have!
- Other people may be less considerate.

329
00:47:55,095 --> 00:47:57,554
Other people! That's what I want
to know about! These other people,

330
00:47:57,847 --> 00:48:00,015
- how many? How many?
- What?

331
00:48:00,266 --> 00:48:01,727
How many other people talk about it?

332
00:48:02,017 --> 00:48:03,895
Heh, really, this isn't a courtroom.

333
00:48:04,144 --> 00:48:07,273
- And I'm not a defendant in a libel suit.
- You may be!

334
00:48:07,522 --> 00:48:11,443
I want to know just who dared to
say these things if I have to force
my way into every house in town.

335
00:48:11,694 --> 00:48:14,280
- I mean to know just who told you these...
- You mean to know!

336
00:48:14,488 --> 00:48:16,866
Well you'll know
something pretty quick!

337
00:48:17,116 --> 00:48:21,243
You'll know that you're
out in the street!
Please to leave my house!

338
00:48:28,086 --> 00:48:31,710
Oh...now you have done it!

339
00:48:31,963 --> 00:48:33,755
What have I done that wasn't
honourable and right?

340
00:48:33,964 --> 00:48:36,883
You think these riff-raff
can go around town bandying
my mother's good name?

341
00:48:37,132 --> 00:48:39,052
They can now!

342
00:48:39,759 --> 00:48:41,637
Georgie, gossip's never
fail till it's denied.

343
00:48:41,844 --> 00:48:44,223
- Well if you think I'm gonna
let my mother's good name...
- Good name!

344
00:48:44,474 --> 00:48:46,849
Nobody has a good name and a bad mouth!

345
00:48:47,101 --> 00:48:49,395
Nobody has a good name and
a...silly mouth, either.

346
00:48:49,687 --> 00:48:52,897
Didn't you understand me when
I told you people are saying my
mother means to marry this man?

347
00:48:53,146 --> 00:48:54,190
- Yes, yes, I understood you.
- Great gosh!

348
00:48:54,441 --> 00:48:56,733
You think of it so calmly!

349
00:48:56,984 --> 00:48:59,035
- Why shouldn't they
marry if they want to?
- Why shouldn't they!

350
00:48:59,085 --> 00:49:00,945
- It's their own affair!
- Why shouldn't they!
- Yes! Why shouldn't they!

351
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:05,074
Oh that you can sit there and
speak of it! Your own sister!

352
00:49:05,324 --> 00:49:07,451
Oh, for heaven's sake!
Don't be so theatrical.

353
00:49:07,992 --> 00:49:09,079
Come back here!

354
00:49:34,890 --> 00:49:36,313
Needn't mind, Mary.

355
00:49:36,854 --> 00:49:38,561
I'll see who it is and what they want.

356
00:49:38,604 --> 00:49:40,317
Probably it's only a peddler.

357
00:49:40,856 --> 00:49:42,190
Thank you, Mr. George.

358
00:49:53,408 --> 00:49:54,743
Good afternoon, George.

359
00:49:55,452 --> 00:49:58,246
Your mother expects to go
driving with me, I believe.

360
00:49:58,497 --> 00:50:01,206
You'll be so kind as to
send her word I'm here.

361
00:50:01,497 --> 00:50:02,334
No.

362
00:50:03,627 --> 00:50:05,920
- I beg your pardon, I said...
- I heard you.

363
00:50:06,173 --> 00:50:08,796
You say that you had an engagement
with my mother, and I said no.

364
00:50:10,341 --> 00:50:11,300
What's the matter?

365
00:50:11,592 --> 00:50:14,303
My mother will have no interest in
knowing that you came here today.

366
00:50:14,844 --> 00:50:15,929
Or any other day.

367
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:17,138
I'm afraid I don't understand you.

368
00:50:17,387 --> 00:50:20,266
It doubt if I can make it
much plainer, but I'll try.

369
00:50:21,098 --> 00:50:22,852
You're not wanted in
this house, Mr. Morgan.

370
00:50:23,809 --> 00:50:25,602
Now or at any other time.

371
00:50:25,854 --> 00:50:26,772
Perhaps you'll understand this!

372
00:51:08,724 --> 00:51:10,269
- Isabel.
- Yes.

373
00:51:10,936 --> 00:51:12,646
- I've just come from Eugene.
- Yes?

374
00:51:16,441 --> 00:51:17,943
I want to talk to you.

375
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:29,340
Well!

376
00:51:32,373 --> 00:51:34,747
I can just guess what that was about!

377
00:51:49,262 --> 00:51:51,096
He's telling her what
you did to Eugene!

378
00:51:51,345 --> 00:51:53,389
- You go back to your room!
- You're not going in there!

379
00:51:53,683 --> 00:51:55,642
- You go back to your room.
- George!

380
00:51:56,893 --> 00:51:59,647
George! No you don't, Georgie Minafer!

381
00:51:59,897 --> 00:52:01,689
- You keep away from here!
- You let go of me!
- I won't!

382
00:52:01,897 --> 00:52:03,649
- Stop taking ahold of me!
- Hush up!

383
00:52:04,899 --> 00:52:07,277
Go on to the top of
the stairs! Go on!

384
00:52:16,327 --> 00:52:17,579
It's indecent!

385
00:52:18,492 --> 00:52:21,290
Like squabbling outside the
door of an operating room!

386
00:52:22,666 --> 00:52:24,919
The idea of you going in there now!

387
00:52:25,251 --> 00:52:27,295
Jack's telling Isabel the whole thing.

388
00:52:27,545 --> 00:52:31,256
Now you stay here and let him tell her!
He's got some consideration for her!

389
00:52:31,508 --> 00:52:33,968
- I suppose you think I haven't?
- You, considerate of anybody!

390
00:52:34,177 --> 00:52:36,135
- I'm considerate of her good name!
- Ahh!

391
00:52:36,386 --> 00:52:38,388
Look here, seems to me you're
taking a pretty different tack!

392
00:52:38,638 --> 00:52:40,348
I thought you already
knew everything I did!

393
00:52:40,850 --> 00:52:43,976
I was...suffering, so I
wanted to let out a little.

394
00:52:44,725 --> 00:52:46,228
Oh, I was a fool!

395
00:52:47,063 --> 00:52:48,648
Eugene never would have looked at me,

396
00:52:48,688 --> 00:52:50,232
even if he had never seen Isabel.

397
00:52:50,983 --> 00:52:53,070
And they haven't done any harm.

398
00:52:53,692 --> 00:52:55,987
She made...Wilbur happy.

399
00:52:56,446 --> 00:52:59,489
She was a true wife to him,
for as long as he lived.

400
00:53:00,907 --> 00:53:04,038
I...Here I go...not doing
myself a bit of good by...

401
00:53:04,328 --> 00:53:06,037
And just ruining them.

402
00:53:06,288 --> 00:53:08,917
You told me how all the riff-raff
in town were busy with her name,

403
00:53:09,165 --> 00:53:11,668
- and the minute I lift my hand to
protect her, you attack me and...
- Shhh!

404
00:53:12,337 --> 00:53:13,628
Your uncle's leaving.

405
00:53:14,169 --> 00:53:15,587
I'll be back, Isabel.

406
00:53:15,837 --> 00:53:17,966
George! Let her alone!

407
00:53:18,216 --> 00:53:20,300
She's down there by
herself. Don't go down.

408
00:53:24,389 --> 00:53:25,722
Let her alone!

409
00:53:58,669 --> 00:53:59,793
Dearest one,

410
00:54:00,461 --> 00:54:04,131
Yesterday I though the time had come
when I could ask you to marry me.

411
00:54:04,426 --> 00:54:06,425
And you were dear enough to tell me,

412
00:54:06,717 --> 00:54:09,009
sometime it might come to that.

413
00:54:09,552 --> 00:54:11,180
But now we're faced,

414
00:54:11,470 --> 00:54:13,015
not with slander,

415
00:54:13,725 --> 00:54:17,018
and not with our own fear of
it, because we haven't any.

416
00:54:17,643 --> 00:54:19,894
But someone else's fear of it.

417
00:54:20,354 --> 00:54:21,564
Your son's.

418
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:26,110
Oh, dearest woman in the world,
I know what your son is to you,

419
00:54:26,358 --> 00:54:27,987
and it frightens me.

420
00:54:28,571 --> 00:54:30,279
Let me explain a little.

421
00:54:31,070 --> 00:54:33,033
I don't think he'll change.

422
00:54:33,239 --> 00:54:36,200
At 21 or 22, so many things appear

423
00:54:36,451 --> 00:54:39,039
solid and permanent and terrible,

424
00:54:39,745 --> 00:54:43,457
which 40 sees in nothing
but disappearing miasma.

425
00:54:44,041 --> 00:54:46,752
40 can't tell 20 about this.

426
00:54:47,293 --> 00:54:50,464
20 can find out only
by getting to be 40.

427
00:54:51,671 --> 00:54:53,717
And so we come to this, dear:

428
00:54:54,425 --> 00:54:57,136
will you live your life your way?

429
00:54:57,512 --> 00:54:59,261
Or George's way?

430
00:55:00,389 --> 00:55:04,768
Dear, it breaks my heart for you,
but what you have to oppose now

431
00:55:05,059 --> 00:55:07,811
is the history of your own

432
00:55:07,905 --> 00:55:09,899
selfless and perfect motherhood.

433
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:12,483
Are you strong enough, Isabel?

434
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:14,734
Can you make a fight?



922
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:36,246
I promise you that if
you take heart for it,

923
00:55:33,376 --> 00:55:36,521
You shall have happiness,
and only happiness.

924
00:55:38,030 --> 00:55:40,632
I'm saying too much
for wisdom, I fear.

925
00:55:41,893 --> 00:55:44,659
But oh my dear, won't you be strong?

926
00:55:45,036 --> 00:55:48,266
Such a little short
strength it would need.

927
00:55:54,682 --> 00:55:57,494
don't strike my life
down twice, dear.

928
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:00,847
This time I've not deserved it.

929
00:56:22,029 --> 00:56:23,037
Come in.

930
00:56:34,277 --> 00:56:35,703
Did you read it, dear?

931
00:56:37,633 --> 00:56:38,850
Yes, I did.

932
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:43,295
All of it?

933
00:56:47,363 --> 00:56:48,411
Yes.

934
00:56:54,871 --> 00:56:56,295
Well what do you think, Georgie?

935
00:56:57,807 --> 00:56:58,814
What do you mean?

936
00:56:59,191 --> 00:57:00,576
You can see how fair

937
00:57:00,787 --> 00:57:01,792
he means to be.

938
00:57:02,045 --> 00:57:03,052
Fair?

939
00:57:05,190 --> 00:57:06,531
Fair when he says you and he

940
00:57:06,572 --> 00:57:07,874
don't care what people say?

941
00:57:08,126 --> 00:57:09,425
What people say?

942
00:57:11,146 --> 00:57:12,487
That Eugene loves me?

943
00:57:12,782 --> 00:57:14,375
He's always loved you.

944
00:57:21,548 --> 00:57:23,098
That's true, Georgie.

945
00:57:24,524 --> 00:57:26,538
But you're my mother.

946
00:57:27,419 --> 00:57:28,930
You're an Amberson.

947
00:57:29,768 --> 00:57:30,776
You just...

948
00:57:31,488 --> 00:57:32,494
Yes, dear?

949
00:57:46,083 --> 00:57:47,636
I don't know, mother.

950
00:58:09,026 --> 00:58:10,661
I'll write Eugene.

951
00:58:13,934 --> 00:58:15,361
He'll understand.

952
00:58:16,661 --> 00:58:17,667
He'll wait.

953
00:58:20,433 --> 00:58:22,029
Be better this way.

954
00:58:26,685 --> 00:58:29,243
We'll go away for awhile, you and I.

955
00:58:34,696 --> 00:58:35,744
Hello.

956
00:58:41,532 --> 00:58:43,337
Lucy, you...

957
00:58:43,629 --> 00:58:45,601
- Haven't you...?
- Haven't I what?

958
00:58:46,313 --> 00:58:47,320
Nothing.

959
00:58:48,329 --> 00:58:51,097
- May I walk with you a little ways?
- Yes, indeed.

960
00:59:01,413 --> 00:59:03,469
I want to talk to you, Lucy.

961
00:59:03,762 --> 00:59:07,369
Hope it's about something nice.
Papa's been so glum today,
he's scarcely spoken to me.

962
00:59:07,830 --> 00:59:09,762
- Well, it's...
- Is it a funny story?

963
00:59:10,096 --> 00:59:11,856
May seem like one to you.

964
00:59:12,234 --> 00:59:13,828
Just to begin with,

965
00:59:14,331 --> 00:59:17,143
When you went away, you didn't
let me know. Not a word!

966
00:59:17,394 --> 00:59:19,492
- Not even a line!
- Why, no!

967
00:59:19,869 --> 00:59:21,967
I just trotted off for some visits.

968
00:59:22,216 --> 00:59:24,442
- At least you might have done something...
- Why no, George!

969
00:59:24,694 --> 00:59:26,411
Don't you remember we'd had a quarrel.

970
00:59:26,663 --> 00:59:29,641
And we didn't speak to
each other all the way home
from a long, long drive.

971
00:59:30,061 --> 00:59:32,577
And since we couldn't play
together like good children,

972
00:59:32,954 --> 00:59:35,513
of course it was plain that
we oughtn't to play at all.

973
00:59:35,766 --> 00:59:36,813
Play!

974
00:59:37,358 --> 00:59:40,967
What I mean is, we'd come
to the point where it was
time to quit playing.

975
00:59:41,511 --> 00:59:42,518
Well,

976
00:59:42,895 --> 00:59:44,321
what we were playing.

977
00:59:44,908 --> 00:59:48,473
- That being lovers you mean, don't you?
- Something like that, it was absurd.

978
00:59:48,936 --> 00:59:52,205
- Didn't have to be absurd.
- No, it couldn't help but be.

979
00:59:52,457 --> 00:59:55,688
The way I am, and the way you are,
it would never be anything else.

980
00:59:56,736 --> 00:59:58,540
This time, I'm going away.

981
00:59:59,252 --> 01:00:01,309
That's what I wanted to tell you, Lucy.

982
01:00:01,810 --> 01:00:03,615
I'm going away tomorrow night,

983
01:00:04,117 --> 01:00:05,419
indefinitely.

984
01:00:05,670 --> 01:00:07,726
I hope you have ever
so nice a time, George.

985
01:00:08,312 --> 01:00:11,208
I don't expect to have a
particularly nice time.

986
01:00:11,419 --> 01:00:13,808
Well then, if I were you,
I don't think I'd go.

987
01:00:16,282 --> 01:00:18,295
This is our last
walk together, Lucy.

988
01:00:18,548 --> 01:00:20,686
Evidently, if you're
going away tomorrow night.

989
01:00:21,860 --> 01:00:24,586
This is the last time
I'll see you, ever.

990
01:00:25,467 --> 01:00:26,893
Ever in my life.

991
01:00:28,486 --> 01:00:31,171
Mother and I are starting on
a trip around the world tomorrow,

992
01:00:32,263 --> 01:00:34,360
and we've made no plans
at all for coming back.

993
01:00:34,611 --> 01:00:36,541
My, that does sound like a long trip.

994
01:00:36,793 --> 01:00:40,189
You plan to be traveling all the
time, or will you stay in one
place for the greater part of it?

995
01:00:40,441 --> 01:00:42,078
I think it would be lovely to...

996
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:44,677
Lucy! I can't stand this!

997
01:00:45,683 --> 01:00:47,825
I'm just about ready to go in
that drugstore there and ask

998
01:00:48,076 --> 01:00:49,333
the clerk to give me
something to keep me

999
01:00:49,374 --> 01:00:50,633
from dying in my sights.

1000
01:00:50,884 --> 01:00:52,815
- It's quite a shock, Lucy.
- What is?

1001
01:00:53,109 --> 01:00:55,834
To find out just
how deeply you care.

1002
01:00:56,296 --> 01:00:59,064
- To see how much difference
this makes to you!
- George!

1003
01:00:59,358 --> 01:01:00,993
I can't stand this any longer!

1004
01:01:01,538 --> 01:01:03,049
I can't, Lucy.

1005
01:01:07,201 --> 01:01:08,460
Goodbye, Lucy.

1006
01:01:11,730 --> 01:01:13,074
It's goodbye.

1007
01:01:23,602 --> 01:01:26,578
- I think it's goodbye for good, Lucy.
- Goodbye, George.

1008
01:01:26,830 --> 01:01:28,718
I do hope that you have
the most splendid trip.

1009
01:01:30,814 --> 01:01:32,533
Give my love to your mother.

1010
01:01:49,983 --> 01:01:53,799
May I please have a few
drops of aromatic spirits of
ammonia and a glass of water?

1011
01:02:00,805 --> 01:02:02,483
For gosh sake, Miss!

1012
01:02:09,822 --> 01:02:11,458
It's mighty nice of you, Lucy.

1013
01:02:11,752 --> 01:02:15,232
You and Eugene to have me over to
your new house my first day back.

1014
01:02:15,483 --> 01:02:18,378
You'll probably find the old
town rather dull after Paris.

1015
01:02:23,537 --> 01:02:24,461
I...found Isabel

1016
01:02:25,258 --> 01:02:27,816
as well as usual.

1017
01:02:30,122 --> 01:02:32,640
Only I'm...afraid
"as usual" isn't...

1018
01:02:33,854 --> 01:02:35,364
particularly well.

1019
01:02:38,300 --> 01:02:40,942
Struck me Isabel oughta
be in a wheelchair.

1020
01:02:42,369 --> 01:02:43,837
What do you mean by that?

1021
01:02:46,018 --> 01:02:48,115
Oh, she's cheerful enough. At least...

1022
01:02:48,744 --> 01:02:50,635
she manages to seem so.

1023
01:02:52,353 --> 01:02:54,154
She's pretty short of breath.

1024
01:02:56,294 --> 01:02:59,022
Father's been that way
for years, of course, but...

1025
01:03:00,154 --> 01:03:02,671
never nearly so much
as Isabel is now.

1026
01:03:04,557 --> 01:03:07,408
I told her I thought she oughta
make Georgie let her come home.

1027
01:03:07,703 --> 01:03:08,710
"Let her"?

1028
01:03:09,716 --> 01:03:11,059
Does she want to?

1029
01:03:12,444 --> 01:03:13,954
She doesn't urge it.

1030
01:03:15,924 --> 01:03:19,826
George seems to like the life there
in his grand, gloomy and peculiar way.

1031
01:03:22,553 --> 01:03:25,487
She'll never change about being
proud of him, and all that.

1032
01:03:26,747 --> 01:03:28,256
It's quite as well...

1033
01:03:30,142 --> 01:03:31,819
she does want to come.

1034
01:03:34,213 --> 01:03:37,188
She'd like to be with father,
of course, and I think she's...

1035
01:03:39,622 --> 01:03:40,460
well...

1036
01:03:41,300 --> 01:03:44,573
She intimated to me one
day that she was afraid
it might even happen that...

1037
01:03:45,370 --> 01:03:47,173
she wouldn't get to see him again.

1038
01:03:49,940 --> 01:03:52,624
Think she was really thinking
of her own state of health.

1039
01:03:54,764 --> 01:03:55,852
I see.

1040
01:03:58,329 --> 01:04:00,971
And you say he won't
let her come home?

1041
01:04:03,740 --> 01:04:06,006
Well uh, I don't think he uses force...

1042
01:04:07,555 --> 01:04:09,276
He's very gentle with her.

1043
01:04:10,534 --> 01:04:13,387
Doubt if the subject is
mentioned between them, yet...

1044
01:04:15,443 --> 01:04:18,127
Yet knowing my interesting
nephew as you do,

1045
01:04:19,888 --> 01:04:22,572
wouldn't you think that was...
about the way to put it?

1046
01:04:25,004 --> 01:04:26,682
Knowing him as I do...

1047
01:04:27,438 --> 01:04:28,402
Yes.

1048
01:04:47,947 --> 01:04:49,164
Changed.

1049
01:04:51,304 --> 01:04:52,687
So change.

1050
01:04:53,567 --> 01:04:54,660
You mean...

1051
01:04:55,414 --> 01:04:56,756
you mean the town?

1052
01:04:57,930 --> 01:05:00,908
- You mean the old place is
changed, don't you dear?
- Yes.

1053
01:05:01,202 --> 01:05:04,052
It'll change to a happier place, old
dear, snow that you're back in it.

1054
01:05:04,558 --> 01:05:06,110
You're going to get well again.

1055
01:05:10,052 --> 01:05:12,888
- Mr. George will be
right down, Mr. Morgan
- Thank you.

1056
01:05:37,081 --> 01:05:39,084
I've come to see your mother, George.

1057
01:05:40,875 --> 01:05:42,294
I'm sorry, Mr. Morgan.

1058
01:05:46,673 --> 01:05:49,720
Not this time, George.
I'm going up to see her.

1059
01:05:50,344 --> 01:05:51,553
The doctor said that...

1060
01:05:53,098 --> 01:05:55,013
she had to be kept quiet.

1061
01:05:56,391 --> 01:05:57,852
I'll be quiet.

1062
01:06:03,484 --> 01:06:06,069
I don't think you
should, right now.

1063
01:06:07,571 --> 01:06:09,154
The doctor says...

1064
01:06:11,325 --> 01:06:12,867
Fanny's right, Gene.

1065
01:06:17,248 --> 01:06:18,958
Why don't you come back later?

1066
01:06:45,193 --> 01:06:46,195
All right.

1067
01:06:58,291 --> 01:06:59,376
She wants to see you.

1068
01:07:32,158 --> 01:07:33,119
Darling...

1069
01:07:33,700 --> 01:07:36,330
- Did you get something to eat?
- Yes, mother.

1070
01:07:37,581 --> 01:07:40,167
- All you needed?
- Yes, mother.

1071
01:07:43,546 --> 01:07:46,550
Are you sure you didn't...
catch cold coming home?

1072
01:07:47,258 --> 01:07:48,844
I'm all right, mother.

1073
01:07:52,222 --> 01:07:53,599
That's sweet...

1074
01:07:55,265 --> 01:07:56,267
Sweet...

1075
01:07:56,893 --> 01:07:58,521
What is, mother darling?

1076
01:07:58,813 --> 01:08:00,856
My hand against your cheek.

1077
01:08:02,233 --> 01:08:03,901
I can feel it.

1078
01:08:09,824 --> 01:08:10,991
I wonder...

1079
01:08:12,242 --> 01:08:14,746
if Eugene and Lucy know
that we've come home.

1080
01:08:15,997 --> 01:08:17,541
I'm sure they do.

1081
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:23,755
Has he asked about me?

1082
01:08:27,717 --> 01:08:28,719
Yes.

1083
01:08:29,552 --> 01:08:30,887
He was here.

1084
01:08:33,806 --> 01:08:35,017
Has he gone?

1085
01:08:37,352 --> 01:08:38,438
Yes, mother.

1086
01:08:44,193 --> 01:08:45,986
I'd like to have seen him...

1087
01:08:49,407 --> 01:08:50,827
just once.

1088
01:08:56,207 --> 01:08:57,790
She must rest now.

1089
01:09:30,616 --> 01:09:31,658
George!

1090
01:09:32,741 --> 01:09:34,162
She loved you!

1091
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:36,457
You loved you!

1092
01:09:38,750 --> 01:09:39,834
And now,

1093
01:09:40,169 --> 01:09:41,504
Major Amberson

1094
01:09:41,796 --> 01:09:45,090
was engaged in the profoundest
thinking of his life.

1095
01:09:45,383 --> 01:09:47,927
And he realized that everything
which had worried him

1096
01:09:48,177 --> 01:09:50,427
or delighted him
during this lifetime,

1097
01:09:51,013 --> 01:09:52,766
all his buying and building

1098
01:09:52,807 --> 01:09:54,518
and trading and banking,

1099
01:09:55,352 --> 01:09:57,853
that it was all trifling and waste,

1100
01:09:58,146 --> 01:10:00,188
beside what concerned him now.

1101
01:10:00,857 --> 01:10:03,485
For the Major knew now that
he had to plan how to enter

1102
01:10:03,777 --> 01:10:05,530
an unknown country,

1103
01:10:06,196 --> 01:10:08,988
where he was not even
sure of being recognized

1104
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:10,741
as an Amberson.

1105
01:10:11,491 --> 01:10:12,454
Father...

1106
01:10:13,787 --> 01:10:14,788
- Father.
- Ah?

1107
01:10:15,997 --> 01:10:18,543
The house was in Isabel's
name, wasn't it?

1108
01:10:21,086 --> 01:10:22,086
Yes.

1109
01:10:22,420 --> 01:10:23,838
Can you remember...

1110
01:10:24,089 --> 01:10:26,050
when you gave her the deed, father?

1111
01:10:27,969 --> 01:10:28,803
No.

1112
01:10:29,178 --> 01:10:30,220
No I...

1113
01:10:30,512 --> 01:10:33,767
- can't just remember.
- It doesn't matter.

1114
01:10:34,727 --> 01:10:37,603
Oh, this estate's about as
mixed-up as an estate can get.

1115
01:10:37,979 --> 01:10:40,024
You oughta have that deed, George.

1116
01:10:40,273 --> 01:10:41,692
No, don't bother.

1117
01:10:50,241 --> 01:10:53,077
It must be...in the sun...

1118
01:10:54,957 --> 01:10:57,082
there wasn't anything here...

1119
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,212
but the sun in the first place.

1120
01:11:03,088 --> 01:11:04,131
The sun...

1121
01:11:05,340 --> 01:11:07,385
The earth came out of the sun,

1122
01:11:08,636 --> 01:11:10,637
and we came out of the earth.

1123
01:11:12,015 --> 01:11:13,057
So,

1124
01:11:13,599 --> 01:11:15,310
whatever we are, we
must be of the Earth.

1125
01:11:23,694 --> 01:11:24,652
Well...

1126
01:11:25,529 --> 01:11:27,823
Odd way for us to be saying goodbye.

1127
01:11:29,408 --> 01:11:32,787
One wouldn't have thought
of even a few years ago.
But here we are!

1128
01:11:33,705 --> 01:11:36,333
Two gentlemen of elegant appearance,

1129
01:11:36,583 --> 01:11:37,959
in a...state of bustitude.

1130
01:11:40,212 --> 01:11:42,378
Ah, you can't ever tell what'll
happen at all, can you?

1131
01:11:43,963 --> 01:11:47,093
Once I stood where you're standing
now to say goodbye to a pretty girl.

1132
01:11:47,384 --> 01:11:50,933
Only it was in the old station, before
this was built, we called it the "depot."

1133
01:11:52,847 --> 01:11:55,728
We knew we wouldn't see each
other again for almost a year...

1134
01:11:56,396 --> 01:11:58,437
I thought I couldn't live through it.

1135
01:11:58,854 --> 01:12:00,650
She stood there crying...

1136
01:12:02,567 --> 01:12:04,528
Don't even know where she lives, now.

1137
01:12:04,986 --> 01:12:06,530
Or if she is living.

1138
01:12:08,282 --> 01:12:10,409
If she ever thinks of me,
she probably imagines

1139
01:12:10,659 --> 01:12:13,371
I'm still dancing in the ballroom
of the Amberson's mansion.

1140
01:12:14,204 --> 01:12:17,042
She probably thinks of the
mansion as still beautiful,

1141
01:12:17,585 --> 01:12:19,710
still the finest house in town.

1142
01:12:22,548 --> 01:12:25,175
Ah, life and money both behave like...

1143
01:12:25,508 --> 01:12:28,053
loose quicksilver in a nest of cracks.

1144
01:12:29,010 --> 01:12:32,516
When they're gone, you can't tell where.
Or what the devil you did with them.

1145
01:12:33,475 --> 01:12:34,475
But I...

1146
01:12:34,808 --> 01:12:37,813
believe I'll say now, while
there isn't much time left for

1147
01:12:38,063 --> 01:12:40,314
for either of us to get
any more embarrassed, I...

1148
01:12:41,232 --> 01:12:42,944
I believe I'll say I've always
been fond of you, Georgie,

1149
01:12:42,986 --> 01:12:44,696
can't say I've always liked you.

1150
01:12:45,488 --> 01:12:47,990
But we all spoiled you
terribly when you were a boy,

1151
01:12:48,281 --> 01:12:50,702
but you've had a pretty heavy children,
you've taken it pretty quietly...

1152
01:12:50,952 --> 01:12:53,036
With the train coming into the shed,

1153
01:12:53,080 --> 01:12:55,165
you'll forgive me saying there's been
times I thought you oughta be hanged.

1154
01:12:55,414 --> 01:12:59,017
And just for a last word, there
may be somebody else in this
town who's always felt about you

1155
01:12:59,212 --> 01:13:02,713
like that. Fond of ya, I
mean. No matter how much it
seems you oughta be hanged!

1156
01:13:02,963 --> 01:13:04,175
- You might try...
- (Last train, last train.)

1157
01:13:04,424 --> 01:13:05,508
I must run!

1158
01:13:05,756 --> 01:13:07,009
I'll send back the money

1159
01:13:07,051 --> 01:13:08,262
as fast as they pay me, so goodbye

1160
01:13:08,512 --> 01:13:09,974
and God bless you, Georgie!

1161
01:13:15,395 --> 01:13:18,563
Did you ever hear the Indian name
for that little grove of beech trees?

1162
01:13:20,232 --> 01:13:21,191
No...

1163
01:13:23,027 --> 01:13:24,988
You never did, either.

1164
01:13:26,113 --> 01:13:26,989
Well?

1165
01:13:27,741 --> 01:13:29,117
The name was...

1166
01:13:29,532 --> 01:13:31,035
Loma Nashah.

1167
01:13:31,619 --> 01:13:33,829
It means "they couldn't help it."

1168
01:13:34,122 --> 01:13:36,834
- Doesn't sound like it.
- Indian names don't.

1169
01:13:37,625 --> 01:13:39,420
There was a bad Indian
chief lived there...

1170
01:13:40,046 --> 01:13:42,047
the worst Indian that ever lived.

1171
01:13:42,672 --> 01:13:43,841
And his name was...

1172
01:13:44,382 --> 01:13:45,551
It was...

1173
01:13:46,470 --> 01:13:47,761
Vendonah.

1174
01:13:48,345 --> 01:13:51,014
- Means "rides down everything."
- What?

1175
01:13:51,432 --> 01:13:54,353
Name was Vendonah, same as
"rides down everything."

1176
01:13:54,602 --> 01:13:55,646
I see.

1177
01:13:58,688 --> 01:13:59,733
Go on.

1178
01:14:01,566 --> 01:14:03,320
Vendonah was unspeakable.

1179
01:14:03,820 --> 01:14:07,740
He was so proud, and he
wore iron shoes and walked
over people's faces with them.

1180
01:14:09,158 --> 01:14:10,994
So at last the tribe decided

1181
01:14:11,285 --> 01:14:14,873
that it wasn't a good enough
excuse for him that he was
young and inexperienced.

1182
01:14:15,289 --> 01:14:16,626
He'd have to go.

1183
01:14:17,793 --> 01:14:20,588
So they took him down to the
river, and put him in a canoe,

1184
01:14:21,004 --> 01:14:22,841
and pushed him out from shore.

1185
01:14:23,507 --> 01:14:25,968
And the current carried
him on down to the ocean.

1186
01:14:26,719 --> 01:14:28,386
And he never got back.

1187
01:14:29,221 --> 01:14:31,349
They didn't want him back, of course.

1188
01:14:31,765 --> 01:14:33,474
They hated Vendonah,

1189
01:14:34,395 --> 01:14:36,438
But they weren't able to discover

1190
01:14:36,688 --> 01:14:39,941
any other warrior they wanted
to make chief in his place.

1191
01:14:41,527 --> 01:14:43,779
They couldn't help feeling that way.

1192
01:14:44,112 --> 01:14:45,071
I see.

1193
01:14:46,323 --> 01:14:48,993
So that's why they named the
place "they couldn't help it."

1194
01:14:49,284 --> 01:14:50,452
Must have been.

1195
01:15:00,753 --> 01:15:03,592
So, you're going to stay in your garden.

1196
01:15:05,509 --> 01:15:07,385
You think it's better just to...

1197
01:15:07,678 --> 01:15:11,765
Keep walking about among your
flowerbeds, till you get old.

1198
01:15:13,309 --> 01:15:16,854
Like a pensive garden lady
in a Victorian engraving? Hmm?

1199
01:15:19,192 --> 01:15:21,901
I suppose I'm like that
tribe that lived here, Papa.

1200
01:15:22,736 --> 01:15:24,947
I had too much unpleasant excitement.

1201
01:15:25,197 --> 01:15:26,698
I don't want any more.

1202
01:15:27,784 --> 01:15:28,744
In fact,

1203
01:15:29,286 --> 01:15:31,077
I don't want anything but you.

1204
01:15:31,662 --> 01:15:32,662
You don't?

1205
01:15:33,663 --> 01:15:35,041
What was the name of that grove?

1206
01:15:35,332 --> 01:15:37,377
- "They couldn't help..."
- Oh, the Indian name, I mean?

1207
01:15:39,294 --> 01:15:40,505
Oh..."Mola Haha."

1208
01:15:42,757 --> 01:15:44,093
Mola Haha...

1209
01:15:45,552 --> 01:15:47,178
That wasn't the name you said.

1210
01:15:47,470 --> 01:15:48,678
Oh, I've forgotten.

1211
01:15:48,970 --> 01:15:50,139
See you have.

1212
01:15:51,142 --> 01:15:53,436
Perhaps you remember
the chief's name better?

1213
01:15:56,353 --> 01:15:57,357
I don't.

1214
01:16:02,277 --> 01:16:04,530
I hope someday you can forget it.

1215
01:16:07,448 --> 01:16:08,950
Try and understand.

1216
01:16:09,159 --> 01:16:12,203
It's not doing either of us any
good going on arguing this way.

1217
01:16:12,496 --> 01:16:15,415
- That place you picked out...
- If this boarding house is practical...

1218
01:16:15,959 --> 01:16:18,587
- And we could be together.
- How?

1219
01:16:18,838 --> 01:16:20,506
On 8$ a week?

1220
01:16:21,005 --> 01:16:24,845
I'm only going to be getting
$8 a week at the law office.

1221
01:16:25,553 --> 01:16:28,429
You...you'd be paying more of
the expenses than I would.

1222
01:16:28,762 --> 01:16:30,224
I'll be paying?

1223
01:16:31,518 --> 01:16:33,977
- I be paying?
- Certainly, you would.

1224
01:16:34,226 --> 01:16:37,315
- We'd be using more of your money than mine.
- My money?

1225
01:16:41,859 --> 01:16:45,782
I've got 28 dollars. That's all!

1226
01:16:46,617 --> 01:16:48,826
- 28 dollars?
- That's all!

1227
01:16:50,119 --> 01:16:52,247
I know I told Jack I didn't put

1228
01:16:52,291 --> 01:16:54,415
everything in the headlight company,

1229
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:56,209
But I did it.

1230
01:16:57,627 --> 01:16:59,129
Every cent.

1231
01:17:00,630 --> 01:17:02,049
And it's gone.

1232
01:17:02,424 --> 01:17:06,510
- Why did you wait till now to tell me?
- I couldn't tell till I had to.

1233
01:17:07,345 --> 01:17:09,138
It wouldn't do any good.

1234
01:17:09,431 --> 01:17:10,474
My gosh!

1235
01:17:10,682 --> 01:17:13,521
Oh, I know what you're gonna do...

1236
01:17:15,729 --> 01:17:16,730
You're...

1237
01:17:17,191 --> 01:17:19,108
you're gonna leave me in the lurch.

1238
01:17:19,357 --> 01:17:21,777
I'm only asking you to be reasonable.

1239
01:17:22,196 --> 01:17:25,948
To try and understand that
it's impossible for either
of us to go on this way.

1240
01:17:26,199 --> 01:17:28,534
- Will you get up!
- I can't!

1241
01:17:30,746 --> 01:17:32,122
I'm too weak!

1242
01:17:33,041 --> 01:17:35,001
Oh, none of this makes any sense!

1243
01:17:35,291 --> 01:17:36,542
Will you get up?

1244
01:17:37,083 --> 01:17:38,755
I know your mother would

1245
01:17:39,005 --> 01:17:41,089
want me to watch over ya.

1246
01:17:41,382 --> 01:17:45,010
And try and make something
like a home for ya.

1247
01:17:45,844 --> 01:17:47,597
And I've tried.

1248
01:17:48,264 --> 01:17:51,766
I tried to make things
as nice for you as I could.

1249
01:17:52,015 --> 01:17:53,186
I know that.

1250
01:17:53,978 --> 01:17:56,147
I walked my heels down

1251
01:17:56,397 --> 01:17:59,275
looking for a place for us to live.

1252
01:18:00,610 --> 01:18:02,195
I-I walked...

1253
01:18:02,486 --> 01:18:04,823
and walked over this town.

1254
01:18:07,867 --> 01:18:11,496
I didn't ride one block on a streetcar.

1255
01:18:13,541 --> 01:18:15,209
I wouldn't use five cents,

1256
01:18:15,501 --> 01:18:18,671
no matter how tired I was.

1257
01:18:19,295 --> 01:18:21,092
Oh, for gosh sakes will you get up!

1258
01:18:21,341 --> 01:18:23,093
Don't sit there with your
back against the boiler.

1259
01:18:23,342 --> 01:18:27,555
- Get up, aunt Fanny!
- It's not hot, it's cold.

1260
01:18:28,389 --> 01:18:30,307
The plumbers disconnected it.

1261
01:18:33,144 --> 01:18:35,523
I-I wouldn't mind if they hadn't!

1262
01:18:37,190 --> 01:18:38,983
I wouldn't mind if it burned!

1263
01:18:39,734 --> 01:18:42,321
I wouldn't mind if it burned me, George!

1264
01:18:42,612 --> 01:18:44,865
Oh, Fanny, for gosh sakes, get up!

1265
01:18:45,115 --> 01:18:46,074
Now stop it!

1266
01:18:46,324 --> 01:18:48,159
Stop this! Do you hear me?

1267
01:18:48,452 --> 01:18:50,288
Stop it! Stop it!

1268
01:18:50,788 --> 01:18:51,997
Listen to me now!

1269
01:18:52,581 --> 01:18:54,166
There; that's better.

1270
01:18:54,540 --> 01:18:56,169
Now let's see where we stand.

1271
01:18:57,295 --> 01:18:59,338
See if we can afford this
place you picked out.

1272
01:18:59,630 --> 01:19:02,258
I'm-I'm sure the boarding
house is practical, George.

1273
01:19:02,550 --> 01:19:05,178
I'm sure it's practical!

1274
01:19:05,471 --> 01:19:07,473
I know it must be practical, aunt Fanny.

1275
01:19:07,723 --> 01:19:11,059
It is a comfort to be
among...among nice people.

1276
01:19:11,560 --> 01:19:13,853
It's all right - I was thinking
of the money, aunt Fanny.

1277
01:19:14,104 --> 01:19:16,524
There's there's there's
one great economy.

1278
01:19:17,817 --> 01:19:20,152
They...they don't allow tipping.

1279
01:19:20,402 --> 01:19:22,780
- They...they have files that prohibit it.
- That's good.

1280
01:19:23,029 --> 01:19:24,949
But the rent's $36 a month,

1281
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:27,452
and dinner $22 and a half for each of us.

1282
01:19:27,953 --> 01:19:29,829
I've got about a hundred dollars left.

1283
01:19:30,204 --> 01:19:31,872
$100, that's all.

1284
01:19:32,248 --> 01:19:35,082
Won't need any new clothes for a year...

1285
01:19:35,752 --> 01:19:36,752
- Perhaps there...
- Or longer...

1286
01:19:37,252 --> 01:19:39,797
- So...so you see...
- Yes, I see.

1287
01:19:40,048 --> 01:19:42,925
I see that $36 and $45 make $81.

1288
01:19:43,593 --> 01:19:45,929
That's the lowest. We'll
need $100 a month.

1289
01:19:47,847 --> 01:19:50,015
And I'm going to be making $32.

1290
01:19:53,645 --> 01:19:55,146
A real flair!

1291
01:19:55,773 --> 01:19:57,691
Real flair for the law!

1292
01:19:57,943 --> 01:20:00,862
That's right! Couldn't wait
till tomorrow to begin.

1293
01:20:01,111 --> 01:20:04,447
The law's a jealous mistress,
and a stern mistress.

1294
01:20:04,699 --> 01:20:07,034
I can't do it. I can't
take up the law.

1295
01:20:07,369 --> 01:20:08,328
What?

1296
01:20:08,579 --> 01:20:10,913
I've come to tell you that
I've got to find something quicker.

1297
01:20:11,162 --> 01:20:12,957
Something that pays from the start.

1298
01:20:13,207 --> 01:20:16,376
I can't think of anything just this
minute that pays from the start.

1299
01:20:16,710 --> 01:20:18,505
Well sir, I've heard that
they pay very wages to people

1300
01:20:18,546 --> 01:20:20,299
in dangerous trades.

1301
01:20:20,676 --> 01:20:23,635
People that handle touchy
chemicals or high explosives,

1302
01:20:23,968 --> 01:20:25,595
men in the dynamite factories.

1303
01:20:25,930 --> 01:20:28,348
Thought I'd see if I couldn't
get a job like that.

1304
01:20:28,766 --> 01:20:30,934
I want to get started
tomorrow if I could.

1305
01:20:31,308 --> 01:20:34,313
Georgie, your grandfather
and I were boys together.

1306
01:20:34,564 --> 01:20:36,522
Don't you think I ought to
know what's the trouble?

1307
01:20:37,023 --> 01:20:39,068
Well sir, it's aunt Fanny.

1308
01:20:40,026 --> 01:20:42,696
She's set her mind on this
particular boarding house.

1309
01:20:42,946 --> 01:20:45,158
It seems she put everything
in the headlight company.

1310
01:20:46,033 --> 01:20:49,954
Well she's...got some old cronies,
and I guess she's been looking forward

1311
01:20:50,247 --> 01:20:54,251
to the games of bridge and
the harmless kind of gossip
that goes on in such places.

1312
01:20:55,295 --> 01:20:57,712
Really, it's the life she'd
like better than anything else.

1313
01:20:58,421 --> 01:21:00,381
Struck me that she's just
about got to have it.

1314
01:21:00,633 --> 01:21:04,136
I got her in that headlight
business with Jack. I feel a
certain responsibility myself.

1315
01:21:04,427 --> 01:21:06,555
I'm taking responsibility. She's
not your aunt you know, sir.

1316
01:21:06,804 --> 01:21:09,849
No, I'm unable to see, even
if she's yours, that a young
man is morally called upon

1317
01:21:10,100 --> 01:21:12,227
to give up a career at the
law to provide his aunt with

1318
01:21:12,478 --> 01:21:14,523
a favourable opportunity
to play to bridge with.

1319
01:21:16,357 --> 01:21:18,234
All right, all right.

1320
01:21:18,942 --> 01:21:22,406
If you promise not to get blown up,
I'll see if we can find you the job.

1321
01:21:23,531 --> 01:21:27,661
You certainly are the most
practical young man I ever met!

1322
01:21:29,537 --> 01:21:32,583
George Amberson Minafer
walked homeward slowly through

1323
01:21:32,833 --> 01:21:36,128
what seemed to be the strange
streets of a strange city.

1324
01:21:36,921 --> 01:21:38,797
For the town was growing

1325
01:21:39,255 --> 01:21:40,423
and changing.

1326
01:21:41,052 --> 01:21:43,844
It was heaving up in
the middle, incredibly.

1327
01:21:44,552 --> 01:21:46,722
It was spreading incredibly.

1328
01:21:47,431 --> 01:21:49,475
And as it heaved and spread,

1329
01:21:49,933 --> 01:21:53,272
it befouled itself, and darkened it's sky.

1330
01:21:55,105 --> 01:21:57,567
This was the last walk home

1331
01:21:58,276 --> 01:22:02,364
he was ever to take up National
Avenue to Amberson Addition,

1332
01:22:02,739 --> 01:22:05,908
and the big old house at the
foot of Amberson Boulevard.

1333
01:22:06,992 --> 01:22:09,289
Tomorrow, they were to move out.

1334
01:22:10,121 --> 01:22:12,374
Tomorrow, everything would be gone.

1335
01:22:20,522 --> 01:22:22,374
Ma, forgive me.

1336
01:22:26,121 --> 01:22:27,373
God forgive me.

1337
01:22:33,688 --> 01:22:35,440
Something had happened.

1338
01:22:35,900 --> 01:22:38,820
A thing which, years ago,

1339
01:22:39,653 --> 01:22:42,698
had been the eagerest
hope of many, many

1340
01:22:42,948 --> 01:22:44,741
good citizens of the town.

1341
01:22:47,119 --> 01:22:48,871
Now it came at last.

1342
01:22:50,582 --> 01:22:52,584
George Amberson Minafer

1343
01:22:53,375 --> 01:22:55,419
had got his come-uppance.

1344
01:22:56,961 --> 01:22:59,257
He got it three times filled,

1345
01:23:00,383 --> 01:23:02,134
and running over.

1346
01:23:04,805 --> 01:23:07,974
But those who has so longed for
it were not there to see it.

1347
01:23:08,642 --> 01:23:10,144
And they never knew it.

1348
01:23:11,311 --> 01:23:13,230
Those who were still living

1349
01:23:13,564 --> 01:23:15,690
had forgotten all about it.

1350
01:23:16,316 --> 01:23:17,818
And all about him.

1351
01:23:20,321 --> 01:23:21,864
All right, stay back there, now.

1352
01:23:22,114 --> 01:23:23,822
He run into me as much
as I run into him.

1353
01:23:24,073 --> 01:23:27,535
And if he gets well, he ain't gonna
get not one single cent out of me!

1354
01:23:27,871 --> 01:23:30,873
I'm perfectly willing to
say I'm sorry for him, and
so's the lady with me.

1355
01:23:31,123 --> 01:23:33,167
Wonderful the damage one of
these little machines can
do you'd never believe it.

1356
01:23:33,417 --> 01:23:35,126
All right sonny, back in
your car, back in your car.

1357
01:23:35,711 --> 01:23:37,005
All right, stay back there now!

1358
01:23:37,340 --> 01:23:40,342

SERIOUS ACCIDENT

01:23:45,305 --> 01:23:47,933
G.A. Minafer, Akers chemical
Co., both legs broken...

1362
01:23:56,235 --> 01:23:57,610
What are you going to do, Papa?

1363
01:24:10,038 --> 01:24:11,457
I'm going to him.

1364
01:24:17,004 --> 01:24:18,381
You coming, Papa?

1365
01:25:05,599 --> 01:25:06,681
How is he?

1366
01:25:08,141 --> 01:25:10,938
- How is Georgie?
- He's going to be all right.

1367
01:25:11,562 --> 01:25:12,396
Fanny,

1368
01:25:12,729 --> 01:25:15,985
I wish you could have seen
George's face when he saw Lucy.

1369
01:25:18,569 --> 01:25:21,322
You know what he said to me
when we went into that room?

1370
01:25:22,240 --> 01:25:23,284
He said,

1371
01:25:26,287 --> 01:25:29,288
"You must have known my mother
wanted you to come here today,"

1372
01:25:30,625 --> 01:25:32,834
"so that I could ask
you to forgive me."

1373
01:25:35,086 --> 01:25:36,465
We shook hands.

1374
01:25:42,259 --> 01:25:45,848
I never noticed before how
much like Isabel Georgie looks.

1375
01:25:48,935 --> 01:25:50,521
You know something, Fanny?

1376
01:25:53,480 --> 01:25:55,775
I wouldn't tell this to anybody but you.

1377
01:26:03,908 --> 01:26:06,494
But it seemed to me as if
someone else was in that room.

1378
01:26:08,705 --> 01:26:10,541
And that through me, she...

1379
01:26:10,750 --> 01:26:13,002
brought her boy under shelter again.

1380
01:26:16,506 --> 01:26:18,631
And that I'd been true at last.

1381
01:26:20,176 --> 01:26:21,846
To my true love.

1382
01:26:35,233 --> 01:26:36,483
Ladies and gentlemen,

1383
01:26:36,733 --> 01:26:38,613
