(SONG: "SOMETHING'S GOTTA GIVE"
BY SAMMY DAVIS JR)

2
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,930
(WOMAN) You know the expression
"a man's man"?

3
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:10,480
A man's man is the leader
of the pack.

4
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,100
The kind of man
other men look up to,

5
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:15,060
admire and emulate.

6
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:19,140
A man's man
is the kind of man who...

7
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,990
just doesn't get
what women are about.

8
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,330
Nick, my ex-husband,
is the ultimate man's man.

9
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:30,410
I probably never
should have married him.

10
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:32,650
I don't think he understood
a thing about me.

11
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:35,790
This is Nick Marshall's office.
Do you want a peek?

12
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,000
Don't worry.
He never gets in before ten.

13
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:41,090
He'll send you on more errands
than anyone in the company.

14
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:42,910
He can't do anything for himself.

15
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:46,290
He's the least politically-correct
guy in the universe.

16
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:49,220
He's the king of all
the T and A ads that we do.

17
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:51,460
You want babes in bikinis,
he's your man.

18
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:55,170
My dad? How can I best describe him?

19
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:57,980
He's always been like an uncle to me.

20
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,440
Yeah. Uncle Dad.

21
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:03,100
Although Nick was a charmer.

22
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:06,390
Completely irresistible at first.

23
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,440
Which feeds into
the whole "Man's man" thing.

24
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:13,190
You know about Nick's mother, right?

25
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:17,070
Because once you understand
about Nick's mother,

26
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,960
you understand Nick.

27
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,920
(CHEERING)

28
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:27,050
Nick was actually born and raised
in Las Vegas.

29
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:32,420
Nick's mother was a real
honest-to-God Las Vegas showgirl.

30
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:36,920
When other boys were outside
riding their bikes and playing ball,

31
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:41,420
Nick was backstage,
hanging with the girls.

32
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,420
He was their mascot.

33
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,190
Their little pet.

34
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:50,510
They couldn't get enough
of those baby blues.

35
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:57,490
If you ask me, Nick's mother
just about killed it

36
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,900
for every woman Nick
would ever meet.

37
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:02,400
She had a lot of sugar daddies
in her life,

38
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,900
but only one true love.

39
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:08,540
The boy with the family jewels.

40
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:12,000
17, 18, 19, 20...

41
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:14,380
And since Nick
didn't have a father,

42
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:17,340
his mom made sure
he was always surrounded

43
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:19,660
by strong male role models,

44
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,040
men her little boy
could really look up to.

45
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:27,310
Keep counting, kid.

46
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:31,010
There was nothing normal about
the way Nick Marshall was raised.

47
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:33,340
So what can you expect?

48
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,400
You don't have to be Freud

49
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:39,690
to figure out this was one
cock-eyed way to enter the world.

50
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,720
Don't you ever knock?

51
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:20,930
It's almost ten. You gotta
go to work and I gotta vacuum.

52
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,770
And don't... Another one
who wears vanilla perfume!

53
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,480
Don't you know any women
who don't smell like candy?

54
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:28,730
Could you toss me my lighter, babe?

55
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,730
Babe? What am l, a little pig?

56
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:34,490
I don't have time to make
you no onion bagels,

57
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:36,080
so please do not beg, OK?

58
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,660
And just for the record...

59
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,700
I don't like finding these things.

60
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:41,700
What kind of woman wears this?

61
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:46,700
My mother wore underwear like that.
Just put them somewhere, babe.

62
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,830
"Babe" is going to put it in the trash,
so your mother can excuse me.

63
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:54,040
Do you ever consider dating a woman
that wears real underwear?

64
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:57,090
You know,
that covers the entire bottom?

65
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:59,220
No. If I do, shall I call you?

66
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:01,680
Ah!

67
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:03,920
I'm going to go clean the kitchen.

68
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,230
You couldn't toast me
a little bagel?

69
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:09,900
Cream cheese, tomatoes, capers?
Please?

70
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,690
- I can't think on an empty stomach.
- OK.

71
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:15,020
But only because
you didn't call me little pig.

72
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,070
OK. You got it, babe.

73
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:26,320
Mr Marshall, how you doing today?

74
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,960
- Fit as a dancing bear.
- I'll get that cab for you.

75
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,610
(LOUD WHISTLE)
That's some set of pipes.

76
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,420
- You have an excellent day, sir.
- And you.

77
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:39,800
At ease.

78
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:57,190
Oh, I'm so sorry!

79
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,810
I absolutely did not mean to do that.
Let me get that for you.

80
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:02,610
- It's OK.
- No, I'm mortified.

81
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:05,980
I can see your hands are full.
Let me get the door for you.

82
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,910
- Thank you.
- No. Thank you.

83
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,950
Half cup, grande, non-f at,
thick foam, wet cap, no lid.

84
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,870
Half cup, grande, non-f at,
thick foam, wet cap, no lid.

85
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,610
- So when do you find out?
- Today, I think.

86
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:22,880
Unless I didn't get it
and then I will just never find out.

87
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,710
I didn't get it. They were
looking for an earth mother.

88
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,590
I overheard the director say
I was more space cadet.

89
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,250
I'm an actress.
I can be whatever you want.

90
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:32,800
Is that true? Can you?

91
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:36,750
It better be true or I'm stuck
playing ditsy coffee-shop girl.

92
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:38,350
Thanks.

93
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,930
Oh. Hi, Nick.

94
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,650
Hi.

95
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:46,850
Lola, my love, when are you going
to let me buy you dinner?

96
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:50,640
Nick, I'm not your type.
Trust me on this one.

97
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,810
Cappuccino, extra foam.
Tall or grande?

98
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:54,360
Grande.

99
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:57,020
- At least I like to think so.
- Next.

100
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,650
Rumour has it that I'm getting some
really big news at work today.

101
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:03,400
Why don't we celebrate?
I'll buy you a cup of coffee.

102
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:06,160
Memo to you -
I work in a coffee shop.

103
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:07,790
Hi. What can I get you?

104
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,340
Do you want me to stop
asking you out?

105
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,880
This'll just take a sec.

106
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:14,920
If that's what you want,
give me the word and I'll stop.

107
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:18,930
Yes. I'm going to give you the word
because I'm an actress,

108
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:22,180
or at least trying to be one.
I'm trying to concentrate on that,

109
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:25,270
so it would be a good thing
if you wouldn't mind...

110
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:27,140
Stop asking me out.

111
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:30,720
You seem so stressed.

112
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,270
I am stressed.
I have a lot on my plate.

113
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,280
Let's not talk now. Why don't
I meet you here tomorrow, say 10.30?

114
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,820
OK. That would be good.

115
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:41,060
- So it's a date?
- It's a date. Thank you.

116
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:44,910
Sir, that was inspiring.

117
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,450
I know.

118
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,870
Good morning. Sloane Curtis.

119
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,580
- Good morning, Mr Marshall.
- Hi. What's the dirt?

120
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:56,210
- I was at breakfast...
- Hey, Norm. You winning?

121
00:07:56,380 --> 00:08:00,160
I heard Miller's shopping around,
looking for a new agency.

122
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:02,250
Miller Lite. I know. I'm all over it.

123
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:04,750
I heard Darcy McGuire left BBD & O.

124
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:07,050
- Morning, Angela.
- Left or was fired?

125
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,430
I don't know.
But everyone's thrilled.

126
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,220
Well. So much for edgy female vision.

127
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:14,600
So that girl we met last night
at the club?

128
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:17,150
Nothing happened
after you put her in the cab?

129
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:21,480
It did? Something happened?
She said she had to be in bed early.

130
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:24,400
I had her in bed by eleven.
Or was it a quarter to?

131
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:26,230
You are a genius. You know that?

132
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,480
What can I tell you? I'm blessed.

133
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:30,400
And today is my lucky day.

134
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:34,190
Not only is my ex-wife Gigi
remarrying, right about now,

135
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:38,040
but Wanamaker wants to see me
first thing. Called twice to confirm.

136
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:39,580
Call me when he makes it official.

137
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:44,540
It won't be so easy for you to suck
up to "Creative Director", you know.

138
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:46,670
I'll make us a lunch res to celebrate.

139
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,500
Don't count your chickens, huh?

140
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:50,090
One o'clock?

141
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:53,430
- Pick you up.
- Can I borrow this?

142
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,060
(SONG: "MACK THE KNIFE"
BY BOBBY DARIN)

143
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:04,230
Hey, Dina. Do you know the
difference between a wife and a job?

144
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,770
What is it?

145
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:08,690
After ten years, the job still sucks.

146
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:12,280
I wouldn't do that if I were you. No.

147
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:15,440
- Oh, Mr Marshall. Hi.
- Hey.

148
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:20,110
I put the Gillette storyboards
on your desk, picked up your shoes,

149
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:24,240
today's staff meeting was cancelled,
and I also got your cigarettes.

150
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:27,610
- The staff meeting was cancelled?
- That's what I was told.

151
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:31,080
Good morning, girls.

152
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:35,500
Good afternoon, sire.

153
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:38,630
Anybody know why the staff meeting
was cancelled?

154
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,220
Nobody called us.

155
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:43,750
But Mr Wanamaker wants to see you
as soon as you get in,

156
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:46,470
which I told his office
was 15 minutes ago.

157
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,020
I know.

158
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,680
You couldn't show up on time?
You're being promoted.

159
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:53,890
But you look very sharp.
Like a creative director.

160
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,570
Very distinguished.

161
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:59,740
Can you two handle yourselves
on the 44th floor?

162
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:02,200
Are you kidding?
We were made for the 44th floor.

163
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:05,280
Now get up there
so we can break out the bubbly.

164
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:07,740
- Don't wait up.
- Don't wait up!

165
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:10,490
- He's so adorable.
- The cutest thing!

166
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:20,130
I'm sorry. I was in the board meeting
that would never end.

167
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,290
- Been here long?
- A couple of minutes.

168
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:25,430
Jess, can I get a cup of decaff
and some Tylenols?

169
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:29,100
And Echinacea and some club soda.
I've got something on my tie.

170
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:31,970
You know what?
Just get me another tie.

171
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:36,310
I saw the mock-ups you did for
Johnny Walker. They are fantastic.

172
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,980
That's my job, Dan.

173
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:40,610
You know I'm not great
at making speeches,

174
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:42,650
especially
when you don't write them!

175
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,680
So I'll do my best. I've been
in this racket over 30 years,

176
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:51,990
and let me tell you, it doesn't get
easier, it gets harder and harder.

177
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,650
The '80s were our glory days.

178
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:57,750
They were all about alcohol,
tobacco and cars.

179
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,330
I was on top of my game.

180
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,000
And then in the '90s,

181
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:04,370
men simply stopped dominating
how the dollars were spent,

182
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:06,420
and we lost our compass.

183
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:08,460
Women between the ages of 16 and 24

184
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:11,550
are the fastest-growing
consumer group in the country.

185
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,040
We're talking about girls born
in the mid-80s,

186
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:16,600
who control our advertising dollars.

187
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,640
Sorry. No Echinacea. Hi, Nick.

188
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:21,270
- Hey.
- Red or lavender?

189
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:24,140
Red. No... Lavender. That's good.

190
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:27,900
While we've been getting our rocks
off shooting beer commercials

191
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:31,480
with the Swedish bikini team,
the industry's been transformed.

192
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:34,400
We were the agency in town
ten years ago.

193
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:36,280
Now we're struggling to be third.

194
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:40,370
If we don't evolve, and think
beyond our natural ability,

195
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:42,990
we're going to go down.

196
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:46,860
"Think beyond our..."? I'm not
quite clear what you mean, Dan.

197
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,280
What do you know
about Darcy McGuire?

198
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:52,340
I heard she just left BBD & O.

199
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,540
I never met the woman,
but I hear she's a real man-eater.

200
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:58,170
She won that Cleo last year
for the ad about the...

201
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:01,220
Oh, yeah, right. That was her?
I forgot about that.

202
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:06,680
I wish I had. Oh, boy.
I hear she is a bitch on wheels.

203
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:08,310
That's very funny.

204
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:10,680
Yeah. Why?

205
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,590
Because I just hired her.

206
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,690
To do what?

207
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,400
You know I love you, Nick,

208
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:22,530
but it's a woman's world out there,

209
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:26,060
and getting into a woman's psyche
is not exactly your strong suit.

210
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,490
You can get into their pants better
than anybody, but not their psyche.

211
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:33,690
You hired Darcy McGuire to do what?

212
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:37,660
She hasn't done it on her own yet,
but somebody was going to grab her.

213
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:41,000
And she's smart, Nick.
She's very smart.

214
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:45,340
You made her Creative Director,
didn't you?

215
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:49,460
I'm sorry, buddy, but I've got
the board breathing down my neck.

216
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:54,460
She's coming in today. You'll meet
her. Come on, roll with this.

217
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:58,480
Work with her. She's got what I need
to keep this place afloat.

218
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:01,440
She's got what you need
meaning she's a woman?

219
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,560
How can we compete with that?

220
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:10,070
He's coming. He's coming.

221
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:14,110
Not so fast, girls.

222
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,410
Put it on ice.

223
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:19,320
We'll break it out soon.

224
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,160
We're not moving to the 44th floor?

225
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:26,170
Not today.

226
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:32,340
- OK, Gigi. One more.
- Gigi, your ex is here.

227
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:44,090
Honey, you look
like 48 million dollars.

228
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:45,640
Thank you.

229
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:48,930
- May I kiss the bride?
- Sure.

230
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:52,470
- Nick.
- Nick!

231
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:56,650
Ted! Congratulations, Ted.
You're a lucky man.

232
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,730
Well, thanks. I happen to agree.

233
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:01,780
So you're going on a cruise.
Two weeks, huh?

234
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:05,700
The cruise is just the last week.
Alexandra has an itinerary.

235
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:08,540
I f axed one to your office,
one to your apartment,

236
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:10,950
Ted's office has one,
as does the school.

237
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,870
In case I f all off the planet?

238
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,500
You never know.

239
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:19,370
Hey, here she is. Pretty in pink.

240
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:21,260
Two whole weeks together, huh?

241
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:24,260
- How are you going to handle it?
- I'm going to love it.

242
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:27,600
You can take care of me.
Cook for me, get me my slippers.

243
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,510
Yeah, that'll be happening.

244
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,760
- Alexandra has a boyfriend now.
- Mom!

245
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:35,050
I'm telling him so he won't
be surprised when he comes by.

246
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:36,810
A boyfriend? You're only 13.

247
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:39,310
Am I? I thought I was 15.

248
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:41,610
We're gonna be fine.

249
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:46,360
I'm going to meet Cameron. Is it OK
if I meet Dad back at his place?

250
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:48,660
- Is that all right with you?
- Yeah, well...

251
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:51,740
- What time?
- Eight? Nine, maybe?

252
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:53,870
- 7.30.
- OK.

253
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,410
Bye, Mom.

254
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:57,570
Oh, honey, I'm going to miss you.

255
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:00,040
I'm going to miss you too.
Ted, have a good time.

256
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:01,710
Bye, pumpkin.

257
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,420
- Nick.
- Honey?

258
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:07,050
Later.

259
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:14,710
7.30's fine. Thanks for asking.
And the name's Dad.

260
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:26,390
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

261
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:32,150
- I heard. I can't believe this.
- My next headache.

262
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,280
Don't worry. We'll get through it.

263
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:37,990
Everyone...

264
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,370
Everyone, meet Darcy McGuire.

265
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:42,280
(APPLAUSE)

266
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:45,870
(DARCY) Hi. Oh, my goodness.
Everybody showed up.

267
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,790
- Nice to see you.
- What a pleasant surprise.

268
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,990
- God what a small world!
- Welcome aboard.

269
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:53,910
I'm so glad to meet you.

270
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,760
Hello. I'm Darcy.

271
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:04,600
- Hi. I'm Nick Marshall.
- I've heard a lot about you, Nick.

272
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:07,140
I've heard a lot about you too,
Darcy.

273
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:08,850
Don't worry. Can't all be true.

274
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:11,650
Let's hope not.

275
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:13,440
Hey.

276
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:16,720
(DAN) Standing room only.
It's a first.

277
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:21,530
I'm very excited for you all
to meet Darcy McGuire.

278
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:26,080
I know Darcy's reputation as
a leader in the field precedes her.

279
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,330
At BBD & O,
Darcy led a creative team

280
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:32,460
that snagged $500 million
in new business wins,

281
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:34,170
and that was just last year.

282
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:38,250
Here at Sloane Curtis, we pride
ourselves on our strategic thinking.

283
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:40,130
Now it's time for us to step up

284
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:44,000
and prove ourselves creatively
in the marketplace.

285
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:47,380
I'm thrilled that Darcy has
consented to move across town,

286
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:50,470
join our team, and lead us
into the 21st century.

287
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,270
(APPLAUSE)

288
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:57,310
Thank you, Dan. And thank you all
for that warm welcome.

289
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,940
Let me start by saying
the feeling is mutual.

290
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:02,010
I am absolutely thrilled to be here.

291
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:06,200
When I first started, it was
my dream to work at Sloane Curtis.

292
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,820
In f act, I even applied
for a job here - twice.

293
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:11,450
Somebody call Personnel.

294
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:16,530
But it was BBD & O
that offered me a home.

295
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:19,420
What I learned there
was that any success I had

296
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:22,420
was a direct result of the team
that I worked with.

297
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:26,760
I know two heads are better
than one, five are better than two.

298
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:30,970
And I know that if we put our heads
and our hearts into this company,

299
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:33,040
we'll deliver. I know that.

300
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:36,340
Now, I love challenges,
I love hard work.

301
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:39,630
I look forward to sitting
at this table, tossing ideas around

302
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:42,520
until, I fear, the wee hours
of the morning.

303
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:46,440
But, most importantly, I want
the work we do to say something

304
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:49,640
about who we are, how we think,
what we feel...

305
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,740
Excuse me.

306
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:58,030
So, as our friends in Hollywood say,
let's cut to the chase.

307
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,740
How are we going to turn
this company around?

308
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:06,660
When Sears decided to go after women
in their advertising

309
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:10,500
and said, "See the softer side of
Sears", their revenues went up 30%%%.

310
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:13,380
30%%%. That's huge.

311
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:17,960
Female driven advertising
totalled $40 billion last year,

312
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:20,680
and Sloane Curtis's
share of that was...?

313
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:24,390
Zero.

314
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:28,690
If you want to sell an anti-wrinkle
cream or a Ford Mustang to a woman,

315
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:32,100
forgive me, but this is the last
place you bring your business,

316
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:35,890
and we can't afford to not
have a piece of a $40 billion pie.

317
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:39,930
So I have put together
a little kit for everybody.

318
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:42,490
Nobody panic.
This is supposed to be fun.

319
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:47,700
Every product in this box is looking
for new representation right now.

320
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:49,370
And they're all made for women.

321
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:52,900
I'm pretty sure all the women here
are familiar with these products,

322
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,790
so for the men,
let's briefly run through them.

323
00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:00,460
Here you go, Nick.

324
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,760
Thank you.

325
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:07,760
Each kit contains
anti-wrinkle cream,

326
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:12,390
mascara, moisturising lipstick,
bath beads,

327
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,520
quick-dry nail polish,
an at-home waxing kit,

328
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:19,390
a "More wonderful" Wonderbra,
a home pregnancy test,

330
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:24,060
pore cleansing strips, Advil,

331
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:27,570
control-top pantyhose
and a Visa card.

332
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:31,160
Now, I want everybody
to come up with something.

333
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:34,410
For one product, for two,
the whole box. Whatever moves you.

334
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:37,410
We'll get together tomorrow
and see where we are.

335
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:39,080
How's 8.30?

336
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,120
Great. See you at 8.30
tomorrow morning.

337
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,210

338

Now let's check in

351
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:36,880
Women's finals.

352
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:39,430
There's too much oestrogen on TV.

353
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:48,100
And we all know the perfect antidote
to oestrogen.

00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:36,290
- I listen to you.
- You think you listen to me?

467
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:38,090
- Yeah.
- You do?

468
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:40,160
What's my boyfriend's name?

469
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:42,380
It's...

470
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:45,380
- Goodnight.
- No, wait. Come back.

471
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:48,180
Dustin is his name.
That's his name, right?

472
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:50,140
No. Don't slam the...!

473
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,810
Car... Carson.

474
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:55,480
Carmen. Carmine!

475
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,600
Carmine. Carmichael!

476
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:06,070
Can't remember a man's name and so
you are not listening to them.

477
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:15,480
What do women want?

478
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:18,120
I know it has three syllables.

479
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:22,710
Cameron.

480
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,420
His name is Cameron!

481
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:56,660
Oh, that is so dangerous.

482
00:28:57,990 --> 00:29:00,400
90%%% of all accidents happen...

483
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:37,150
(STELLA) Oh, what the hell
has he done now?

484
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:40,530
I hope he's not dead.

485
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:45,410
No, I'm fine.

486
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:47,620
Oh, boy.

487
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,160
I think.

488
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:55,370
- Are you sure?
- No...yes.

489
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,100
Cleaner pores.

490
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:18,850
Thicker hair.

491
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:21,600
Very weird headache. Very weird.

492
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:24,570
Now I gotta clean up bras
and home pregnancy tests?

493
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:27,610
The man doesn't pay me enough
for the things I have to do.

494
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:31,530
Oh, Jesus, he's wearing pantyhose.
Now he's a cross dresser?

495
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:36,330
I was just experimenting with
a few products from work. All right?

496
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:39,250
Did I say anything?

497
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:41,960
Oh, God, it's eight o'clock already.

498
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,830
One day I'd like to sleep
till eight.

499
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,040
He'd fire my ass
if I didn't wake him.

500
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:48,200
Ooh! Are we in a mood today.

501
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:51,380
Same as every other day.

502
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:55,840
Honey, make me a little bagel
with cream cheese.

503
00:30:56,010 --> 00:30:57,670
I can't think on an empty stomach.

504
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:02,270
For your information,
I am not even hungry.

505
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:04,510
Who said you were?

506
00:31:05,810 --> 00:31:08,270
- Mr Marshall.
- Good morning, Flo.

507
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,820
- Let me get you a cab, sir.
- Sure.

508
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:14,570
Thank you, Flo.

509
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:16,730
You're welcome, my little sweet ass.

510
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:19,320
What did you say?

511
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:23,240
- Me? Nothing.
- Are you sure?

512
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:26,150
Yes, sir.

513
00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:28,290
Gr-rr-rr!

514
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:32,790
I think I'll walk today.
I could use fresh air.

515
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,950
You have a great day, sir.

516
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:39,050
With your fine ass
looking like Shaft!

517
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:41,620
Ooh! I could just ride that puppy!

518
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,970
Hey! Watch where you're going!

519
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:47,710
- Are you OK, sir?
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

520
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,480
(WOMAN) Did I turn
the coffee maker off?

521
00:31:55,650 --> 00:31:58,320
Did I turn it off?
I can't remember.

522
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:02,070
I saw the light on, but did
I actually turn the switch off?

523
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:05,160
One kiss doesn't make me
a lesbian.

524
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,910
Does it?

525
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,830
Sorry.

526
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:15,120
Two slices of toast, 150 calories,
plus a pat and a half of butter...

527
00:32:15,290 --> 00:32:18,990
So oestrogen is good for the heart
but bad for the breasts? What?

528
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:20,590
My kid doesn't need Ritalin...

529
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:23,760
-lf I get him to listen to me...
-Monsieur, I need to poop!

530
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:27,040
Oh, God! Oh, boy!

531
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:28,800
(CACOPHONY OF VOICES)

532
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:43,190
Oh, God, he nearly killed me.
Too bad he missed.

533
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:56,950
- Good morning.
- Good mor...

534
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,540
Don't look up. He'll make me hear
another disgusting joke.

535
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:02,080
He's such a schmuck.

536
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,670
She thinks that I'm a schmuck?

537
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:13,550
Whoa! Lighten up
on that aftershave, buddy.

538
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:20,760
What? Oh, yeah, like
you've got the perfect body?

539
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:23,390
Jesus.

540
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:26,270
- Hi, Mr Marshall.
- Don't say it.

541
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,980
What? The Gillette budget's
on your desk,

542
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:31,550
and I got you that Merlot you wanted.

543
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:33,560
Here's your credit card back.

544
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:37,190
Thank you.

545
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:40,690
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

546
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:43,660
Do you realise I have
an Ivy League education,

547
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:46,320
and that running your errands
has put me into therapy?

548
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:48,820
Why don't you give me
some real work to do?

549
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,870
Oh, yeah, I remember why.
Because I have a vagina!

550
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,630
Is there anything else I can get?

551
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:58,880
Oh, good, you're on time.

552
00:33:59,050 --> 00:34:00,790
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

553
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:02,960
What's the matter?
You look different.

554
00:34:03,130 --> 00:34:06,890
I think it's his hair.
It looks a little thicker.

555
00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:08,470
Give me your coat.

556
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:11,100
- You smell good today.
- New cologne?

557
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:20,440
That's it? No other thoughts?

558
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:23,150
- What do you mean?
- Are you feeling all right?

559
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:29,280
Linings, loans, locks...

560
00:34:29,450 --> 00:34:31,860
Hello, Nick?

561
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:33,410
Ah, Nick?

562
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:35,870
We gotta go. What are you doing?
It's 8.30.

563
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:39,490
I can't go. Gotta find a doctor.
I need a cure. Can't go.

564
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:42,540
You sound like the guy from Shine.
What's wrong with you?

565
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:45,960
Maybe I need an exorcist.
Under X. No, under E.

566
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:51,260
There are no exorcists
in the Greater Chicago area, bud.

567
00:34:51,430 --> 00:34:55,100
Let's pull it together and go sell
some sensitive feminine shit, OK?

568
00:34:56,310 --> 00:34:58,130
Sorry to interrupt. Here you go.

569
00:34:58,310 --> 00:35:02,060
By the way, your hair looks
really good today, Mr Marshall.

570
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:04,190
And it's OK you pay me
minimum wage

571
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:08,140
because I just called my boyfriend
in Israel - for an hour.

572
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:12,360
Tell me you heard that?

573
00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:14,820
Your hair looks really good.
So what?

574
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:17,480
The what she was thinking thing.

575
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:21,530
I don't think she thinks too much.
She's not exactly a genius, pal.

576
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:24,870
- She went to an Ivy League school.
- I doubt that.

577
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:28,790
The thing she said about
the boyfriend, calling him in Israel.

578
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,920
I didn't hear it
because she didn't say it.

579
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:36,300
Let's pull it together. We're going
to be late for our sorority meeting.

580
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,260
Morgan...

581
00:35:39,890 --> 00:35:42,040
In case I like, maybe, die today...

582
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:45,760
Can we walk and talk? In case you
live, I don't want to be late, OK?

583
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:48,640
Here's what happened,
in case the coroner asks.

584
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:52,010
I got drunk last night and tried
all the products from the box.

585
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:54,510
- You did not?
- I put on all the products.

586
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:56,520
Nail polish, pantyhose, everything.

587
00:35:56,690 --> 00:35:58,740
- You tried on the pantyhose?
- Yes! OK?

588
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:01,940
I was drying my hair and I fell
over and fell into the bathtub,

589
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:03,700
electrocuted myself and blacked out.

590
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:08,040
When I woke up, I could hear what
every woman around me was thinking.

591
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:11,080
- Uh-huh.
- Personal, private stuff.

592
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:13,920
The stuff that nobody on earth
is supposed to hear.

593
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:16,840
You know what I'm saying?
I can hear what women think.

594
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,290
Can you? Good. That's not a talent
a lot of guys have these days.

595
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:23,010
You don't believe me?
You want me to prove it?

596
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:25,000
- See this attorney?
- Yeah.

597
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:30,390
She thinks you're overpaid...and gay.

598
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,930
What?

599
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:35,770
I can hear what they're all
thinking. Even French poodles!

600
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:39,300
Just so we are on the same page,
I need you to know you sound insane.

601
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,940
You're freaked out
over losing the job,

602
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:45,690
but if you tell anyone that you hear
the thoughts of a French poodle...

603
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:47,240
What if I jumped out the window?

604
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:50,490
Just put the fruit down
and jump through the glass.

605
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:54,360
Would they notice? Probably not
if I didn't get glass on anybody.

606
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:58,750
The girl with the fruit is kind
of funny -suicidal, but she's funny.

607
00:36:58,910 --> 00:37:01,630
Nick, what girl with the fruit?

608
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:10,760
Last one to arrive. Wants me
to know I'm not his boss.

609
00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:12,920
OK. You're a star.
I get the message.

610
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:16,540
She thinks I'm late because I want
her to know she's not my boss.

611
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,050
- What is she talking about?
- Put a lid on it.

612
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:22,560
I can't believe I have
butterflies in my stomach.

613
00:37:22,730 --> 00:37:24,270
Feels like the first day of school.

614
00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:29,020
OK. So let's see how we did.

615
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,390
Nobody wants to go first.

616
00:37:32,570 --> 00:37:37,280
Everyone's avoiding me...
except Nick Marshall.

617
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:40,530
Unbelievable. The only one
with good eye contact.

618
00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:43,570
At least he's looking in my eyes
and not down my blouse.

619
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:45,570
So, Nick, what did you come up with?

620
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:47,540
Me? What did I come up with?

621
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:50,920
He's so wired.

622
00:37:52,210 --> 00:37:55,750
Mostly I thought about
the moisturising lipstick.

623
00:37:57,010 --> 00:37:58,970
Never having worn lipstick myself.

624
00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:03,930
I tried to imagine what I'd want
from a lipstick if I were a woman.

625
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:06,770
-Spare me!
- OK. He's trying to be honest.

626
00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:09,510
You know, to be perfectly honest,

627
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:14,510
my first thought was a Tahitian
beauty bathing under a waterfall.

628
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:17,440
I'm going to die here
with these kinds of ideas.

629
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:21,980
But, you know, I'm working on it,
and it's evolving...

630
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,200
I don't suppose anybody's
interested in an idea

631
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:28,120
involving the Swedish bikini team?
I do know them all personally.

632
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,370
-Oh, what an idiot.
-Grow up already.

633
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:34,610
-What a pig.
-You are so foul.

634
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:36,290
I should have asked
for more money.

635
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,290
Dina?

636
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:43,300
I spent the night trying to figure
out how to sell Advil just to women.

637
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:48,180
You know what? We should
sell it to women like me.

638
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:50,720
I take it every time
I need to fake a headache.

639
00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:53,100
Works like a charm.

640
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:57,190
I got a great one. Just came to me.
Mind if I interrupt, Dina?

641
00:38:57,350 --> 00:38:59,090
No. Sure. Go ahead.

642

I hate that you've seen me naked.

643

All right. We're in a bedroom,
the lights are out.

644
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,280
There's a woman in bed
taking an Advil.

645
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:12,480
Her husband turns over
and suggestively rubs her back,

646
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:15,410
and we say, "Advil...

647
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:20,820
"so mild and gentle, you can take it
even when you're faking a headache."

648
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:25,210
And then the woman says,

649
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:28,050
"Not tonight, dear,
I need an Advil."

650

He's back.

651

What? Come on, that doesn't reach
women on a personal level?

652
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:41,090
- No.
- Women do that, don't they?

653
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:42,920
-Not me.
- I don't.

654
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:48,230
Sue Cranston? You've done that,
haven't you? Faked a headache?

655
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:51,650
No, Nick, I haven't.
Thanks for asking.

656
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:54,930
No, no, no. Wait, wait.
Be honest now.

ten, twelve years?

It doesn't work like a charm?

No, Nick, I haven't.

OK. I guess I'm way off base here.

663
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:16,240
OK. What's good about your idea

664
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:19,670
is that you're looking at Advil
from a woman's point of view.

665
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:22,840
Um... I don't think Advil
will go for it,

666
00:40:23,010 --> 00:40:25,720
and I'm pretty sure every woman
in America will hate it,

I thought it was great.

00:48:10,970 --> 00:48:12,550
Oy vay!

775
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:14,220
You can say that again.

776
00:48:14,390 --> 00:48:17,420
- I didn't say anything!
- It doesn't mean I didn't hear it.

777
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:19,470
OK. OK.

778
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:22,130
Let's say...
Let's say I do believe you.

779
00:48:22,310 --> 00:48:25,840
That you er...that you can hear
what women think.

780
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:28,060
Even though I'm a grown woman of...

781
00:48:28,230 --> 00:48:29,610
51.

782
00:48:29,770 --> 00:48:31,150
..47.

783
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:33,280
My lips are sealed.

784
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:34,990
Holy crap!

785
00:48:35,150 --> 00:48:36,860
- Oh, forgive me.
- It's all right.

786
00:48:37,030 --> 00:48:40,900
But this is phenomenal!
That you can hear inside my head.

787
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:42,450
Yes.

788
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:44,660
Why get rid of such a gift?

789
00:48:44,830 --> 00:48:47,320
Well, for starters,

790
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:50,620
almost every woman I know
thinks I'm an asshole.

791
00:48:50,790 --> 00:48:52,250
That's what I thought first.

792
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:54,050
Could you please give me a break?

793
00:48:54,210 --> 00:48:57,330
Mr Marshall, you might find this
a little unorthodox,

794
00:48:57,510 --> 00:49:00,180
- but would you mind if I smoked?
- No. I understand.

795
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:01,840
Thank you so much.

796
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:16,770
Let's try to look
at the upside of this.

797
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:22,070
You know, Freud died at age 83
still asking one question.

798
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:23,820
What do women want?

799
00:49:23,990 --> 00:49:28,320
Wouldn't it be strange and wonderful
if you were the one man on earth

800
00:49:28,490 --> 00:49:30,650
finally able to answer that question?

801
00:49:30,830 --> 00:49:35,790
Something extraordinary
and miraculous has happened to you.

802
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:39,130
My advice is
you must learn from this.

803
00:49:39,290 --> 00:49:41,700
There isn't a single woman
that I treat

804
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:44,550
that doesn't wish her man
understood her better.

805
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:48,050
If men are from Mars and women
are from Venus, you speak Venusian.

806
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:50,600
The world can be yours.

807
00:49:51,470 --> 00:49:54,180
I don't know how this happened
to you or why,

808
00:49:54,350 --> 00:49:58,190
but you may just be
the luckiest man on earth.

809
00:49:59,190 --> 00:50:01,310
Imagine the possibilities.

810
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:03,690
If you know what women want...

811
00:50:04,690 --> 00:50:06,430
you can rule.

812
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:38,050
Hubba-hubba, here he comes.
Looking awfully good today.

813
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:41,310
And I haven't had sex
in four months... OK, six.

814
00:50:41,470 --> 00:50:45,480
Oh, why did I tell him to stop
asking me out? I'm an idiot. Idiot!

815
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:49,650
Hey, Nick, how's it going?

816
00:50:49,810 --> 00:50:51,190
Lola, my love...

817
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:54,190
I can't take no for an answer.

818
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:56,850
- About what?
- About what?

819
00:50:58,150 --> 00:50:59,660
About us.

820
00:50:59,820 --> 00:51:03,330
Just don't hurt me, Nick.
I've been hurt too many times.

821
00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:08,330
I know how hard it is
to go out with someone new.

822
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:10,960
I mean, there's always that fear of...

823
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:13,450
well...getting hurt.

824
00:51:13,630 --> 00:51:16,550
- At least, that's how I feel.
- You do? Really?

825
00:51:16,710 --> 00:51:18,420
All the time.

826
00:51:18,590 --> 00:51:20,300
- Me too all the time.
- So...

827
00:51:20,470 --> 00:51:22,540
let's take it slow
and see how it goes.

828
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:25,420
Slow is good.

829
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:28,170
- Slow is really good.
- Yeah.

830
00:51:29,470 --> 00:51:30,850
You free tonight?

831
00:51:31,020 --> 00:51:34,520
So you don't think I'm gay?
You're saying you never said that.

832
00:51:34,690 --> 00:51:37,060
- Right. I never said that.
- But you thought it.

833
00:51:37,230 --> 00:51:39,270
Was it the hair?
The highlights are natural.

834
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:42,730
- I have a meeting.
- And you never said I was overpaid?

835
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:45,910
I really don't think
I ever said that.

836
00:51:46,070 --> 00:51:47,450
OK.

837
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:49,940
Who has he been talking to?

838
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:51,860
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

839
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:53,860
Well, check your e-mail...

840
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:56,200
Hi. How's the boyfriend in Israel?

841
00:51:56,370 --> 00:52:00,040
Thanks for picking up that wine.
That is above and beyond. Thank you.

842
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:02,910
Can I get you a cup of coffee?

843
00:52:03,090 --> 00:52:06,340
- Or some water? Any beverage?
- No, but thank you.

844
00:52:06,510 --> 00:52:09,760
If I'm thirsty, I know
where the coffee-room is.

845
00:52:09,930 --> 00:52:13,600
That's right, guys. Don't help.
Just walk right past me.

846
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:15,560
Why don't you step on my hands...?

847
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:17,140
- Here you go.
- Oh.

848
00:52:17,310 --> 00:52:18,930
How are you doing?

849
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:22,770
Oh, fine. Thank you, Mr Marshall.

850
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:24,310
You're welcome...er?

851
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:25,860
- Erin.
- Erin.

852
00:52:26,020 --> 00:52:28,230
You be careful, all right, Erin?

853
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:29,900
Yeah. Sure.

854
00:52:31,570 --> 00:52:33,030
Heavy.

855
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:38,120
What do you know?
There is life on this planet.

856
00:52:43,830 --> 00:52:46,750
(DARCY) Breakfast on Tuesday
sounds great. Absolutely.

857
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:50,000
Thanks for the info,
and thanks for the champagne.

858
00:52:54,590 --> 00:52:56,470
You too. OK. Bye-bye.

859
00:52:58,260 --> 00:53:02,350
Set meeting. Nike.
Women's division.

860
00:53:03,470 --> 00:53:05,930
- Hi.
- Hi. Well...

861
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:07,980
Looks like you've been here a year.

862
00:53:08,140 --> 00:53:11,060
Yeah. I'm compulsive.
It's a problem.

863
00:53:11,230 --> 00:53:13,980
Why do I always feel
he's checking me out?

864
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:18,490
I wonder what he's got
up his sleeve.

865
00:53:18,650 --> 00:53:20,310
Great photographs.

866
00:53:20,490 --> 00:53:22,120
No clue they're
Margaret Bourke White.

867
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:25,080
They're not all
Margaret Bourke White, are they?

868
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:26,900
Yeah, they are.

869
00:53:27,830 --> 00:53:30,040
Wow. It's a beautiful collection.

870
00:53:30,210 --> 00:53:32,700
Thanks. So how's it going?

871
00:53:32,870 --> 00:53:34,920
I was going to ask you
the same thing.

872
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:37,410
It's starting slow.

873
00:53:37,590 --> 00:53:40,380
I'm evaluating some of the staff
and that's always hard.

874
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:42,370
Yeah. Right.

875
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:55,180
I don't want to beat around the bush,
so what I'd like to propose...

876
00:53:55,350 --> 00:53:57,150
He's proposing so soon?

877
00:53:57,310 --> 00:54:00,820
- Oh!
- Oh, sorry. Ah, yes.

878
00:54:00,980 --> 00:54:03,780
- Excuse me. You got another one.
- Thanks.

879
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:05,320
Wow!

880
00:54:06,610 --> 00:54:08,850
As I was saying,
I know nothing whatsoever

881
00:54:09,030 --> 00:54:11,700
about the products
that you're going for personally,

882
00:54:11,870 --> 00:54:14,080
but I do believe
I can sell anything

883
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:16,240
once I know the buyer's needs.

884
00:54:16,410 --> 00:54:19,330
What I'd really like,
with your kind indulgence, of course,

885
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:21,660
is to go after that really big fish.

886
00:54:21,830 --> 00:54:25,790
I mean, the one your really want
to land. I will reel them in for us.

887
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:28,840
No, actually,
I will reel them in for us.

888
00:54:29,010 --> 00:54:31,840
Unless you're going
after something yourself.

889
00:54:32,010 --> 00:54:34,850
No, no. It's just there are several
big fish out there.

890
00:54:35,010 --> 00:54:37,140
Yeah? What's your biggest fish?

891
00:54:37,310 --> 00:54:39,100
I mean, who's your whale?

892
00:54:40,430 --> 00:54:42,760
Um...Nike? Women's division?

893
00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:45,090
You heard they were shopping?

894
00:54:45,270 --> 00:54:47,180
I got wind of it.

895
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:49,230
That's amazing. I heard no one knew.

896
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:51,480
- You knew.
- I heard no one else knew.

897
00:54:51,650 --> 00:54:55,270
It's OK if I know what you know.
I mean, we're on the same team now.

898
00:54:55,450 --> 00:54:58,410
Besides, I heard someone say
two heads were better than one.

899
00:54:58,580 --> 00:55:01,940
- Oh, you were listening?
- More than you know.

900
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:04,610
OK. Here is what I heard.

901
00:55:04,790 --> 00:55:07,330
Nike is shopping - quietly.

902
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:10,130
But if they make a change,
it's going to happen fast.

903
00:55:10,290 --> 00:55:12,620
You know this is a tough one
for us to get.

904
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:15,040
It would be tough for anybody,
but if we got it...

905
00:55:15,210 --> 00:55:18,220
-that's all we'd need.
- I hear you.

906
00:55:18,380 --> 00:55:20,540
So what do they want exactly?

907
00:55:21,890 --> 00:55:23,680
They want to empower women.

908
00:55:25,430 --> 00:55:28,140
- What?
- Well... I'm sorry, I...

909
00:55:28,310 --> 00:55:31,510
- That won't work.
- I'm sorry. I understand. Go on.

910
00:55:31,690 --> 00:55:33,930
They want
to get inside women's heads

911
00:55:34,110 --> 00:55:36,320
and reach them on a very real level.

912
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:38,030
Don't take this the wrong way,

913
00:55:38,190 --> 00:55:40,570
but you got jumpy talking
about a lipstick.

914
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:44,320
Nike is state-of-the-art,
hardcore woman power.

915
00:55:44,490 --> 00:55:45,870
Are you sure you want this one?

916
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:50,000
You get them here in two weeks,
I'll be ready.

917
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:51,960
This guy is kind of exciting.

918
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:54,080
Hey! Glad I caught you both.

919
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:55,790
- You got a minute?
- Sure.

920
00:55:55,960 --> 00:56:00,130
I want you to look at these boards
for US Air before they come by.

921
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:02,790
- Right.
- It seems like something's missing.

922
00:56:02,970 --> 00:56:04,960
Hmm. I don't like the graphics.

923
00:56:05,130 --> 00:56:06,760
Feels a bit parochial.

924
00:56:06,930 --> 00:56:09,420
Maybe it should be
in black and white.

925
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:10,970
What do you think, Nick?

926
00:56:11,140 --> 00:56:14,310
I don't know who you've had working
on these, Dan, but...

927
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:16,690
it seems kind of - what's the word? -

928
00:56:16,850 --> 00:56:20,220
parochial to me.
What do you think, Darcy?

929
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:23,400
I totally agree.
Especially about the graphics.

930
00:56:23,570 --> 00:56:26,820
They're parochial.
It's so funny you just said that.

931
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:32,570
Why don't you get them to try it in
black and white. Might punch it up.

932
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:36,480
What? Did you say something?

933
00:56:38,330 --> 00:56:42,110
No. I just swear I was thinking
the exact same thing.

934
00:56:42,290 --> 00:56:44,000
Were you?

935
00:56:45,670 --> 00:56:48,790
Black and white could really help.
Good idea, Nick.

936
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:52,630
Good idea, Nick! Quick,
say something before he leaves.

937
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:54,180
- Dan?
- Yeah?

938
00:56:54,340 --> 00:56:57,680
If you want me to have another look
at the boards, give me a buzz.

939
00:56:57,850 --> 00:56:59,840
- I will. Thanks, buddy.
- Dan?

940
00:57:00,020 --> 00:57:03,690
In case they find Nick's idea
too retro, which they might.

941
00:57:03,850 --> 00:57:06,310
They may hear elegant
and think it's old fashioned.

942
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:09,650
I'd be ready with maybe
a dot com kind of thing.

943
00:57:09,820 --> 00:57:12,140
Maybe there's something
about getting online

944
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:14,610
and being online at the airport...

945
00:57:14,780 --> 00:57:17,950
I think we're fine. We're good.
I like Nick's fix on this.

946
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:19,490
Great.

947
00:57:19,660 --> 00:57:21,950
Do you want to come by later?
I got a box of Cubans.

948
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:23,540
- Great.
- Cool.

949
00:57:24,450 --> 00:57:25,870
You smoke cigars?

950
00:57:27,620 --> 00:57:29,000
No.

951
00:57:29,170 --> 00:57:32,200
Your office is looking
really snazzy. I love the red.

952
00:57:32,380 --> 00:57:33,750
- Thanks.
- Me, too.

953
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:35,910
Mr Marshall,
your daughter on line one.

954
00:57:36,090 --> 00:57:38,930
- I'm sorry, would you mind if...?
- Here you go.

955
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:43,300
He has a daughter?
I didn't picture that. How old?

956
00:57:43,470 --> 00:57:45,850
She's 15. She's staying with me
while her mom's away.

957
00:57:46,010 --> 00:57:47,670
He's married?

958
00:57:47,850 --> 00:57:50,880
Away on her honeymoon. Alex, hi.

959
00:57:51,060 --> 00:57:53,270
Uh-huh. Sure, honey.
No, that's great.

960
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:55,560
Honey?
Who are you trying to impress?

961
00:57:55,730 --> 00:57:57,970
I'm going out
with my friends after school.

962
00:57:58,150 --> 00:58:00,560
Can I bring them back to your place?

963
00:58:00,740 --> 00:58:03,990
No problem. Whatever you want.
What time are you going to be home?

964
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:05,900
Wait for me. I gotta go.

965
00:58:07,830 --> 00:58:11,190
Eight's fine. I love you too.
Bye, sweetie.

966
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:14,650
Total shocker.
He's like a nice guy.

967
00:58:14,830 --> 00:58:18,200
- Sorry. Duty calls.
- No. Of course.

968
00:58:18,380 --> 00:58:20,420
- She's 15?
- Yeah.

969
00:58:20,590 --> 00:58:22,050
She's got a boyfriend who's 18.

970
00:58:22,210 --> 00:58:24,290
- And you hate that, right?
- Oh, hate it.

971
00:58:24,470 --> 00:58:28,680
But she digs him and he's invited
her to the prom. That's a big deal.

972
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:32,100
Going to the prom is mostly
about the dress. You know that?

973
00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:33,640
- Is it?
- Oh, yeah.

974
00:58:33,810 --> 00:58:36,840
Once you got the dress handled,
it's all downhill.

975
00:58:37,020 --> 00:58:40,720
This feels like a date. Why did
I go into all that? He needs to go.

976
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:42,400
Well, I'm outta here.

977
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:45,360
Do some research downtown.
Get inside women's heads.

978
00:58:45,530 --> 00:58:46,900
If you need any help...

979
00:58:47,070 --> 00:58:49,310
- Oh, I'll be picking your brain.
- You got it.

980
00:58:49,490 --> 00:58:51,150
I'll take it.

981
00:58:53,570 --> 00:58:55,950
Oh, candy. She won't last a month.

982
00:58:58,750 --> 00:59:00,650
You can't wear that if you have hips.

983
00:59:00,830 --> 00:59:03,580
- That one's cute.
- I can't wear low cut.

984
00:59:03,750 --> 00:59:05,910
- (NICK) Alex?
- It's open.

985
00:59:08,750 --> 00:59:11,330
What? Say something.

986
00:59:11,510 --> 00:59:15,180
Ah... Hi. I'm Alex's dad, Nick.

987
00:59:15,340 --> 00:59:17,250
- Hi.
- Hi.

988
00:59:17,430 --> 00:59:20,310
-Deadbeat.
-Mr No-food-in-the-house.

989
00:59:20,470 --> 00:59:23,980
-Forgot her birthday.
-Why is he just standing there?

990
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:27,310
Oh, I just wanted to let you know
that I was home.

991
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:32,530
I've got a date tonight, so I'm
going out, but I'll be home early.

992
00:59:32,690 --> 00:59:35,810
Why don't you order a pizza?
There's no food in the joint.

993
00:59:35,990 --> 00:59:39,660
I also wanted to know if you and I
could go on a date soon.

994
00:59:39,820 --> 00:59:42,150
I'd like to take you shopping
for a prom dress.

995
00:59:42,330 --> 00:59:44,480
Oh, that is so sweet.

996
00:59:44,660 --> 00:59:48,410
I wish my dad would do something
like that. Oh, I love him.

997
00:59:48,580 --> 00:59:53,320
First you throw Cameron out, now you
want me to go to the prom with him?

998
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:57,120
Well, I overreacted and I just
want to make up for it

999
00:59:57,300 --> 00:59:58,670
by taking you shopping.

1000
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:01,380
I mean, it's a pretty important
thing, you know.

1001
01:00:01,550 --> 01:00:03,290
It's all downhill after the dress.

1002
01:00:03,470 --> 01:00:06,100
He must be stoned. Fine.

1003
01:00:06,260 --> 01:00:10,050
I'll get the most expensive dress,
shoes, make-up. He can afford it.

1004
01:00:10,230 --> 01:00:13,560
What the hell, let's go crazy
while we're at it.

1005
01:00:13,730 --> 01:00:16,730
We'll get you new make-up, shoes,
the works. What do you say?

1006
01:00:16,900 --> 01:00:18,400
Fine. Whatever.

1007
01:00:19,110 --> 01:00:21,600
That would mean yes, yes?

1008
01:00:21,780 --> 01:00:23,680
Yes.

1009
01:00:23,860 --> 01:00:27,230
Great. Well, nice to have met
you two. Hope to see you again soon.

1010
01:00:27,410 --> 01:00:28,990
- Definitely.
- Bye, Mr Marshall.

1011
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:31,070
- Love the apartment.
- Great view.

1012
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:32,750
Thank you. OK.

1013
01:00:46,010 --> 01:00:50,470
I gotta tell you, I'm not usually
like this on a first date.

1014
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:52,850
It's just that you've been
so amazing.

1015
01:00:53,010 --> 01:00:56,460
You've been so sensitive,
so understanding and...

1016
01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:04,560
- Do you want to come up?
- Oh, yeah.

1017
01:01:04,730 --> 01:01:06,520
Am I ready for him to come up?

1018
01:01:06,690 --> 01:01:10,060
If I sleep with him, he'll think
I'm a slut and never call me,

1019
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:12,860
or call me because he'll think
he can get it whenever he wants.

1020
01:01:13,030 --> 01:01:16,450
Oh, what's the difference?
He's so incredible.

1021
01:01:16,620 --> 01:01:18,690
He reminds me of my sister.

1022
01:01:19,580 --> 01:01:21,290
So, what do you think?

1023
01:01:21,450 --> 01:01:24,570
Lola, I will only come up
if you really want me to.

1024
01:01:24,750 --> 01:01:27,460
I don't want you to do anything
you're not ready for.

1025
01:01:27,630 --> 01:01:29,130
I can wait.

1026
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:34,130
Wow, he's got a great body...

1027
01:01:34,300 --> 01:01:35,930
but whoa!

1028
01:01:36,090 --> 01:01:39,460
What's with the tongue? I'm going
to need the Heimlich manoeuvre.

1029
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:41,010
Thank you.

1030
01:01:41,180 --> 01:01:43,640

1031
01:01:43,810 --> 01:01:46,380
Ouch! That's right,
they're attached.

1032

OK. Lied about the grande...

1035
01:01:56,990 --> 01:02:01,360
Aah! Would you mind if we had
the lights on, maybe?

1036
01:02:01,530 --> 01:02:02,990
You don't want the light on?

1037
01:02:03,160 --> 01:02:06,120
- Yeah, it might help.
- OK. If it'll help.

1038
01:02:06,290 --> 01:02:08,860
God, I hope he's better
with the light on.

1039
01:02:11,750 --> 01:02:15,090
He's so all over the place.

01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:26,960
Yeah. I'm fine. Fine.

All right. Let's pull this together,

01:04:51,060 --> 01:04:53,350
# On the sidewalk

01:04:53,770 --> 01:04:56,260
# Ooh, Sunday morning

1086
01:04:56,440 --> 01:04:59,010
# Lies a body

1087
01:04:59,190 --> 01:05:01,650
# Just oozing life

1088
01:05:03,110 --> 01:05:05,600

(DARCY) Living life.

1091
01:05:09,700 --> 01:05:12,270
Life. Keep on living it.

1092
01:05:13,530 --> 01:05:15,330
Ooh, that's good.

1093
01:05:15,490 --> 01:05:17,000
# There's a tugboat

1094
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:19,620
# Down by the river, don't you know?

1095
01:05:19,790 --> 01:05:22,670
# With a cement bag

1096
01:05:22,830 --> 01:05:25,330
# Just drooping on down

1097
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:28,460
# Oh, that cement is just... #

1098
01:05:28,630 --> 01:05:30,790
I'm 34 and I wanted kids!

1099
01:05:32,090 --> 01:05:36,640
# Five will get you ten
old Mackie's back in town... #

1100
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:38,770
Ha! I love it.

1101
01:05:38,930 --> 01:05:43,260
# Old Jenny Diver, Old Sukie Taudry

1102

# Look out, Miss Lotte Lenya

1103
01:05:46,270 --> 01:05:49,770
# And old Lucy Brown

01:05:49,940 --> 01:05:52,650
# As that line forms

1105
01:05:52,820 --> 01:05:55,360
# On the right, babe

1106
01:05:55,530 --> 01:06:01,230
# Now that Mackie's

1107
01:06:02,080 --> 01:06:05,250
# Back in town!

1108
01:06:05,830 --> 01:06:07,710
# Look out, old Mackie is back! #

1109
01:06:10,460 --> 01:06:13,090
OK. One more. Time for one more.

1110
01:06:13,250 --> 01:06:15,920
You know why guys like doing it
in front of the mirror?

1111
01:06:16,090 --> 01:06:17,470
Why?

1112
01:06:17,630 --> 01:06:21,000
Because objects may appear larger
than they actually are.

1113
01:06:21,180 --> 01:06:22,760
That is a good one.

1114
01:06:24,010 --> 01:06:26,310
I heard that in the beauty shop
this morning.

1115
01:06:26,470 --> 01:06:30,880
But seriously, Dee, that other
thing we were talking about before?

1116
01:06:32,060 --> 01:06:35,400
I mean, he can't just
ignore you all night,

1117
01:06:35,570 --> 01:06:37,310
stay glued to the TV
like some zombie

1118
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:39,730
and expect you
to turn on like a light bulb.

1119
01:06:39,900 --> 01:06:41,490
I wouldn't put up with that.

1120
01:06:41,650 --> 01:06:44,910
I mean, you're either interesting
or you're not.

1121
01:06:45,070 --> 01:06:46,780
Ask him to decide.

1122
01:06:46,950 --> 01:06:48,530
Can I write that down?

1123
01:06:48,700 --> 01:06:52,370
I'm either interesting or I'm not.
He'll shit a brick.

1124
01:06:53,830 --> 01:06:56,580
What if he says I'm not?

1125
01:06:57,630 --> 01:07:00,740
He won't say that you're not.

1126
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:03,300
Trust me.

1127
01:07:04,170 --> 01:07:05,760
OK. I did it.

1128
01:07:05,930 --> 01:07:08,500
I told Haim
I wasn't moving to Israel.

1129
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:11,710
Yeah. Good. And?

1130
01:07:11,890 --> 01:07:14,210
I said what you said.
He can be a writer anywhere,

1131
01:07:14,390 --> 01:07:17,510
but if I'm going to be in advertising,
I need to be here.

1132
01:07:17,690 --> 01:07:20,310
- And then he said?
- I don't know. It was in Hebrew.

1133
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:23,600
But I don't think it was,
"You got it. See you next Tuesday".

1134
01:07:23,770 --> 01:07:26,490
I'd wait it out. He'll call you.

1135
01:07:26,650 --> 01:07:28,860
I can't. I'd better call him back.

1136
01:07:29,030 --> 01:07:32,120
Be strong. He will call you.

1137
01:07:33,660 --> 01:07:37,030
Well, girls, it's been nice chatting.
I gotta get back to work.

1138
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:39,750
- Wait!
- Don't you want some coffee?

1139
01:07:39,910 --> 01:07:42,160
Oh, no, I'm cool.

1140
01:07:42,330 --> 01:07:43,710
Really.

1141
01:07:44,790 --> 01:07:46,170
But thank you anyway.

1142
01:07:47,210 --> 01:07:48,630
This was fun.

1143
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:50,620
Oh..!

1144
01:07:53,430 --> 01:07:57,430
This is good. More insightful
than I would have thought.

1145
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:00,880
This line doesn't feel exactly right.

1146
01:08:01,060 --> 01:08:04,420
If you're thinking that line isn't
perfect, I agree. It needs work.

1147
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:06,900
There's something
not exactly right about it.

1148
01:08:07,060 --> 01:08:10,570
I mean, it's not bad.
It's insightful, actually, it's just...

1149
01:08:11,860 --> 01:08:14,150
What do you think
this woman's thinking?

1150
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:16,360
Ah, well...

1151
01:08:17,740 --> 01:08:19,200
Let's see.

1152
01:08:20,070 --> 01:08:22,650
She's thinking about
what she wants out of life.

1153
01:08:22,830 --> 01:08:26,110
What's she going to accomplish?
How's she going to do all that?

1154
01:08:26,290 --> 01:08:28,700
Women think about that a lot.

1155
01:08:28,870 --> 01:08:32,410
Surprisingly a lot. They worry
all the time, about everything.

1156
01:08:33,420 --> 01:08:35,380
You're so right.
How do you know that?

1157
01:08:37,010 --> 01:08:38,630
Well, even I had a mother.

1158
01:08:40,050 --> 01:08:44,350
Well, so maybe running
gives her time off from all of that.

1159
01:08:44,510 --> 01:08:48,380
It gives her something she can't
get any place else. Look at her.

1160
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:52,430
God, I want to be her.
She looks so free, doesn't she?

1161
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:55,480
No one's judging her.
No boss to worry about.

1162
01:08:55,650 --> 01:08:58,320
No guys to worry about.
No games to figure...

1163
01:08:58,480 --> 01:09:00,970
I like that. No games. That's good.

1164
01:09:01,150 --> 01:09:02,740
That'd be nice in life, wouldn't it?

1165
01:09:04,110 --> 01:09:06,320
OK. Can I just think for one second?

1166
01:09:06,490 --> 01:09:08,200
- Take your time.
- OK.

1167
01:09:08,660 --> 01:09:10,120
OK.

1168
01:09:10,280 --> 01:09:12,080
No games.

1169
01:09:12,250 --> 01:09:15,330
How do I get that in?
She's running. It's early.

1170
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:18,580
It's quiet. Just the sound
of her feet on the asphalt.

1171
01:09:19,500 --> 01:09:22,080
She likes to run alone.
No pressure. No stress.

1172
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:25,370
This is the one place
she can be herself.

1173
01:09:26,760 --> 01:09:29,640
Look any way she wants.
Think any way she wants

1174
01:09:30,470 --> 01:09:32,680
No game playing. No rules.

1175
01:09:32,850 --> 01:09:35,470
Games, sports, rules.
Games, sports, rules.

1176
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:38,890
Playing by the rules,
playing games versus playing...

1177
01:09:39,060 --> 01:09:42,090
Playing by the rules,
playing games versus playing...

1178
01:09:43,060 --> 01:09:46,430
- Why are you nodding?
- I think you're on to something.

1179
01:09:46,610 --> 01:09:48,190
- Am I?
- Aren't you?

1180
01:09:48,360 --> 01:09:50,740
Well, I was thinking
about a play on words.

1181
01:09:50,900 --> 01:09:53,150
Something about games versus...

1182
01:09:54,570 --> 01:09:56,570
I feel like I was
on to something good.

1183
01:09:56,740 --> 01:09:58,730
- Playing games versus playing...
- Sports?

1184
01:09:58,910 --> 01:10:01,240
Yes! Thank you.
Do you like any of this?

1185
01:10:01,410 --> 01:10:04,750
A lot. I like the idea
that you can be yourself on the road.

1186
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:07,490
I do too. Did I say that out loud?

1187
01:10:07,670 --> 01:10:09,380
No, I was just...

1188
01:10:09,550 --> 01:10:12,460
I was circling around the exact
same thing, which is great -

1189
01:10:12,630 --> 01:10:14,260
that we're both on the same...

1190
01:10:14,420 --> 01:10:17,880
Sorry. I'm not thinking straight.
My glands may be swollen.

1191
01:10:18,050 --> 01:10:21,250
You're doing great!
"Nike. No games..."

1192
01:10:21,430 --> 01:10:22,890
"Just sports."

1193
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:25,920
All right. We should write that down.

1194
01:10:26,100 --> 01:10:27,640
All right.

1195
01:10:28,440 --> 01:10:30,480
Did he come up with that or did I?

1196
01:10:33,780 --> 01:10:35,280
Can I be...?

1197
01:10:37,650 --> 01:10:39,030
What?

1198
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:42,560
Ah... Well, can I be honest with you?

1199
01:10:43,530 --> 01:10:44,910
Please do.

1200
01:10:45,080 --> 01:10:48,780
Before I came here, I heard
you were a tough chauvinistic prick.

1201
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:50,950
I didn't know you meant that honest.

1202
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:52,500
- Sorry.
- No, it's fine.

1203
01:10:52,670 --> 01:10:54,210
- I'm sorry.
- No, that's OK.

1204
01:10:54,380 --> 01:10:56,500
You must have looked forward
to meeting me.

1205
01:10:56,670 --> 01:11:00,010
I was dreading it. I had this
whole other person in my mind.

1206
01:11:00,170 --> 01:11:03,870
Well, since we're sharing,
I heard a few things about you too.

1207
01:11:04,050 --> 01:11:08,510
Oh, yes. I'm the "Man-eating bitch
Darth Vader of the ad world"?

1208
01:11:08,680 --> 01:11:11,430
- Verbatim.
- Really?

1209
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:13,420
All right. Well, nice to meet you.

1210
01:11:14,440 --> 01:11:16,680
But that's not who I am at all.

1211
01:11:18,020 --> 01:11:19,610
Just for the record.

1212
01:11:19,770 --> 01:11:22,270
I don't think that's who you are.

1213
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:25,400
Thank you. I appreciate that.

1214
01:11:29,660 --> 01:11:32,740
You see, no games
equals embarrassing moment.

1215
01:11:32,910 --> 01:11:35,660
Don't fall for a guy at work.
Don't fall for a guy at work.

1216
01:11:35,830 --> 01:11:37,370
Don't fall for a guy at work.

1217
01:11:37,540 --> 01:11:40,250
- Why?
- Why what?

1218
01:11:40,420 --> 01:11:43,340
Why...why don't I just work
on these storyboards

1219
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:46,260
and bring them round to you tomorrow
if you're free?

1220
01:11:46,420 --> 01:11:48,410
I'm free. Just call me any time.

1221
01:11:48,590 --> 01:11:50,220
I'm flirting!
What's wrong with me?

1222
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:52,790
Oh, God! I just looked
at his penis!

1223
01:11:52,970 --> 01:11:54,680
Oh, I hope he didn't see me.

1224
01:11:54,850 --> 01:11:57,960
Oh, shit! I just looked
at it again! Stop it!

1225
01:11:58,850 --> 01:12:02,130
- Are you all right?
- Fine. I got something in my eye.

1226
01:12:02,310 --> 01:12:04,770
All right. Um, so, great.

1227
01:12:04,940 --> 01:12:07,970
So tomorrow will be...
That'll be great. I'll see you then.

1228
01:12:09,530 --> 01:12:11,430
- Good work, by the way.
- You too.

1229
01:12:11,610 --> 01:12:13,940
- You sure you're all right?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

01:13:28,010 --> 01:13:29,670
Yeah.

1237
01:13:29,850 --> 01:13:32,600
Good. I didn't think
anyone else was still here.

1238
01:13:32,770 --> 01:13:34,140
I didn't know anyone was here.

1239
01:13:34,310 --> 01:13:36,800
- What time is it?
- It's after ten.

1240
01:13:36,980 --> 01:13:40,180
- I didn't realise it was so late.
-I feel so alone.

1241
01:13:40,360 --> 01:13:43,280
I...I didn't catch that. Sorry.

1242
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:45,240
I didn't realise how late it was.

1243
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:49,070
I'm glad you're here.
I'm stuck. I feel so alone.

1244
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:50,900
Want me to give you a hand
with this?

1245
01:13:51,070 --> 01:13:52,620
No, thanks. I'm OK.

1246
01:13:52,780 --> 01:13:54,910
Yeah? I'm not buying it.
What's going on?

1247
01:13:55,080 --> 01:13:58,080
Well, I have an early meeting
tomorrow with Dan.

1248
01:13:58,250 --> 01:14:01,360
I wanted to make it later
so I could be more prepared,

1249
01:14:01,540 --> 01:14:04,790
but you slipped in and took
the only time he had left,

1250
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:07,420
which left me with 8.15
tomorrow morning.

1251
01:14:07,590 --> 01:14:09,500
I'm not as ready as I wish I was.

1252
01:14:09,670 --> 01:14:12,590
- Sorry.
- You didn't do it on purpose.

1253
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:17,000
I just don't want him
to be disappointed.

1254
01:14:17,180 --> 01:14:19,340
Why don't we
go through these together?

1255
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:21,670
- Really?
- I insist.

1256
01:14:21,850 --> 01:14:23,760
Unless you're too tired.

1257
01:14:23,940 --> 01:14:27,610
- No. I'm not tired.
- I can see that.

1258
01:14:30,230 --> 01:14:32,530
It's just so far beyond tired
at this point.

1259
01:14:32,690 --> 01:14:35,780
I basically stopped sleeping
ever since I took this job.

1260
01:14:35,950 --> 01:14:37,450
- You have?
- Yeah.

1261
01:14:37,620 --> 01:14:40,080
It's weird...
How do I say this?

1262
01:14:40,240 --> 01:14:43,250
You don't feel
quite like yourself here?

1263
01:14:43,410 --> 01:14:45,000
No, I don't.

1264
01:14:45,160 --> 01:14:47,040
Not yet, anyway.

1265
01:14:47,830 --> 01:14:49,210
Boy.

1266
01:14:50,500 --> 01:14:54,260
Plus I'm mad that I'm getting sick.
I never ever get sick.

1267
01:14:54,420 --> 01:14:57,220
In f act, you don't have
to sit so close to me.

1268
01:14:57,380 --> 01:14:58,800
I'll brave it.

1269
01:14:58,970 --> 01:15:02,470
So where do we kick off?
Control-top pantyhose?

1270
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:05,810
- OK.
- Personally, I think they work.

1271
01:15:05,970 --> 01:15:08,680
You've worn control-top pantyhose?

1272
01:15:09,890 --> 01:15:11,600
Did you put a pair in the pink box?

1273
01:15:11,770 --> 01:15:13,980
- Seriously?
- Oh, yeah.

1274
01:15:15,270 --> 01:15:18,230
- You are full of surprises.
- Yeah.

1275
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:20,810
No. I mean that
as a compliment. I love that.

1276
01:15:21,570 --> 01:15:24,910
- And how did you look in them?
- Ooh, hot.

1277
01:15:26,660 --> 01:15:29,910
My daughter and her boyfriend
walked in and I had them on.

1278
01:15:31,160 --> 01:15:34,000
And they said what when
they saw you in your pantyhose?

1279
01:15:34,170 --> 01:15:37,130
I think it was the Wonderbra
they noticed first,

1280
01:15:37,290 --> 01:15:39,620
and the nail polish -
fingers and toes...

1281
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:43,720
# Why not use your mentality?
Wake up to reality

1282
01:15:45,260 --> 01:15:49,720
# But each time I do,
just the thought of you

1283
01:15:49,890 --> 01:15:53,420
# Makes me stop just before I begin

1284
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:57,020
# 'Cause I've got you
Under my skin. #

1285
01:16:02,900 --> 01:16:05,390
(ALEX) The dress you picked
is totally hideous.

1286
01:16:05,570 --> 01:16:07,810
- I'm not coming out.
- It can't be that bad.

1287
01:16:07,990 --> 01:16:10,820
I look like a nun. An ugly nun.

1288
01:16:10,990 --> 01:16:13,700
Because it's grey?
Grey is the new black.

1289
01:16:17,790 --> 01:16:20,030
If he says he likes it, I'll die.

1290
01:16:20,210 --> 01:16:21,750
OK. Next.

1291
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:24,070
This, I love.

1292
01:16:26,630 --> 01:16:28,130
Thank you. Next.

1293
01:16:28,300 --> 01:16:33,090

1316
01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:58,250
- I think this is the one.
- I like that... No, I love that.

1317
01:17:58,420 --> 01:18:01,620
OK. This is it.
Let me take a look.

1318
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:06,510
Yes. I look older.
This is great. Oh, God...

1319
01:18:06,670 --> 01:18:08,300
I need boobs.

1320
01:18:08,470 --> 01:18:11,220
I'll buy a padded bra
when he's not around.

1321
01:18:11,390 --> 01:18:14,220
This is what I'll be wearing
the last night I'm a virgin.

1322
01:18:14,390 --> 01:18:17,230
Or should I say
what I'll be taking off?

1323
01:18:19,890 --> 01:18:24,440
Alex, I want to talk to you about
something that's pretty important.

1324
01:18:24,610 --> 01:18:27,640
I've never talked to you
about this before but...

1325
01:18:27,820 --> 01:18:31,600
Oh, God. He's going to try to
be a dad. This should be hilarious.

1326
01:18:32,530 --> 01:18:34,690
I realise I haven't been
the perfect dad.

1327
01:18:34,870 --> 01:18:36,940
Understatement of the century.

1328
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:39,190
- Can you pass the bread?
- Yeah, sure.

1329
01:18:39,370 --> 01:18:42,460
That doesn't mean I don't have
the right to talk to you about...

1330
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,550
- About?
- All right.

1331
01:18:48,710 --> 01:18:50,250
You're a young woman now,

1332
01:18:50,420 --> 01:18:54,630
and you may be flirting
with the idea of...of...

1333
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:58,640
Having sex?
Can I get a lemonade, please?

1334
01:18:59,300 --> 01:19:02,640
Well, boys and girls
think very differently about sex.

1335
01:19:02,810 --> 01:19:07,300
My hunch is that girls want guys
to like them and hang out with them.

1336
01:19:07,480 --> 01:19:11,610
Whereas guys... And not all guys,
right, but most guys...

1337
01:19:12,190 --> 01:19:14,320
they pretty much
just want to have sex.

1338
01:19:15,610 --> 01:19:18,730
OK. What I'm trying to say here is,

1339
01:19:18,910 --> 01:19:22,740
I don't want you to feel pressured
because your boyfriend's older.

1340
01:19:22,910 --> 01:19:24,280
Please. Save it.

1341
01:19:24,450 --> 01:19:26,910
Mom had this talk with me
when I was like eleven.

1342
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:30,330
I know you're supposed
to have sex when it's special.

1343
01:19:30,500 --> 01:19:33,380
I know everything.
And Mom knows me for real,

1344
01:19:33,540 --> 01:19:35,530
and knows my friends
and knows Cameron,

1345
01:19:35,710 --> 01:19:37,950
so let's leave the parental talks
up to her.

1346
01:19:38,130 --> 01:19:40,970
Plus I promised Cameron
I'd do it prom night.

1347
01:19:41,630 --> 01:19:44,720
And let's not make me part
of this Nick makeover,

1348
01:19:44,890 --> 01:19:46,430
or whatever this new thing is, OK?

1349
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:49,270
- What new thing?
- What new thing?!

1350
01:19:49,430 --> 01:19:51,670
This ridiculous new guy
you're trying to be.

1351
01:19:51,850 --> 01:19:53,350
Clowning around with me.

1352
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:57,270
Asking if we can make a salad
together, watch Friends together.

1353
01:19:57,440 --> 01:20:00,400
I mean, it's nuts
after 15 years of no relating.

1354
01:20:00,570 --> 01:20:04,890
I mean, come on. Who are you
to talk about relationships anyway?

1355
01:20:05,070 --> 01:20:09,070
You never had a real relationship
with anyone in your entire life.

1356
01:20:09,240 --> 01:20:12,240
Look, I'm supposed
to meet my friends,

1357
01:20:12,410 --> 01:20:15,660
- so I'm going to go, OK?
- Sure.

1358
01:20:15,830 --> 01:20:17,710
Thanks for the dress.

1359
01:20:20,790 --> 01:20:24,490
She didn't even finish her lunch.
Giving her advice?

1360
01:20:24,670 --> 01:20:26,550
-Teenagers.
-I think the talk worked.

1361
01:20:26,720 --> 01:20:29,260
-She's totally right.
-Move on, dude, it's over.

1362
01:20:29,430 --> 01:20:31,050
Ah, please.

1363
01:20:34,680 --> 01:20:36,890
Now you've seen
how the cake is assembled,

1364
01:20:37,060 --> 01:20:39,520
the next time you admire
a wedding cake

1365
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:41,560
you can appreciate
its architecture...

1366
01:20:41,730 --> 01:20:44,360
That's so gorgeous.

1367
01:20:46,520 --> 01:20:49,100
Fit, vibrant, hair...

1368
01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:52,240
I always hated being overweight.

1369
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:55,240
I wanted to be thin, pretty,
wear cute clothes.

1370
01:20:55,410 --> 01:20:58,410
It built and built
and my health deteriorated.

1371
01:20:58,580 --> 01:21:00,160
I couldn't walk or stand.

1372
01:21:00,330 --> 01:21:03,660
Couldn't even stand up at the park
for 10 minutes while my kids played.

1373
01:21:03,830 --> 01:21:07,450
I tried sitting on the swings,
but the chains cut into my hips.

1374
01:21:07,630 --> 01:21:09,870
And I couldn't run,
and I couldn't move.

1375
01:21:10,040 --> 01:21:12,590
I was tired and I wanted
to be a good mom...

1376
01:21:12,760 --> 01:21:15,130
I couldn't go on living that way.

1377
01:21:15,300 --> 01:21:17,620
What the hell's wrong with me?
(PHONE RINGS)

1378
01:21:20,680 --> 01:21:22,100
Hello?

1379
01:21:22,260 --> 01:21:23,890
(DARCY) What am I doing?

1380
01:21:24,060 --> 01:21:25,430
Darcy?

1381
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:28,440
How did you know it was me?
I didn't say anything.

1382
01:21:29,440 --> 01:21:31,060
I just sensed it.

1383
01:21:31,230 --> 01:21:33,470
Shit! Idiot!
I didn't think he'd be there.

1384
01:21:33,650 --> 01:21:37,020
- Excuse me?
- I didn't mean to really call you.

1385
01:21:37,190 --> 01:21:41,150
I had your number here
and I was thinking of you.

1386
01:21:41,320 --> 01:21:43,060
Thinking of calling you.

1387
01:21:44,410 --> 01:21:46,030
Obviously I did call you.

1388
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:49,200
Oh, no, that's all right. I...er...

1389
01:21:49,910 --> 01:21:51,500
I was thinking about you too.

1390

(MELLOW JAZZ PLAYS)

1391
01:22:05,010 --> 01:22:10,000
# I could show the world
how to smile... #

1392
01:22:12,390 --> 01:22:14,470
Here's to another great idea.

1393
01:22:14,640 --> 01:22:16,300
You mean, let's meet for a drink?

1394
01:22:16,480 --> 01:22:19,230
Yes. That's exactly
what I wanted to say.

1395
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:22,280
Sometimes I think
you're a bit of a mind reader.

1396
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:25,600
But I don't have
to be a mind reader with you.

1397
01:22:25,780 --> 01:22:28,570
- You always say what you think.
- I know. It's a curse.

1398
01:22:28,740 --> 01:22:32,330
Are you kidding?
It's a relief. An enormous relief.

1399
01:22:32,490 --> 01:22:35,290
Do you know how rare that is?
To say what you think.

1400
01:22:35,450 --> 01:22:39,580
Do you know how rare it is
for someone to like that about me?

1401
01:22:39,750 --> 01:22:43,170
Trust me, this has not been
a great thing in my life.

1402
01:22:43,340 --> 01:22:45,910
My ex-husband didn't love me,
let's put it that way.

1403
01:22:47,590 --> 01:22:49,010
He didn't love you?

1404
01:22:49,170 --> 01:22:50,920
Did I just say that?

1405
01:22:51,090 --> 01:22:52,470
Oh, God!

1406
01:22:54,010 --> 01:22:56,970
I meant to say "it".
He didn't love it.

1407
01:22:57,140 --> 01:22:58,850
That I spoke my mind.

1408
01:23:01,270 --> 01:23:04,640
If you want the truth, I'm not sure
he ever did really love me.

1409
01:23:04,810 --> 01:23:07,650
- Oh.
- There's a conversation starter!

1410
01:23:07,820 --> 01:23:11,150
God, a smart person
would just get so very drunk now.

1411
01:23:13,030 --> 01:23:14,690
How long were you married?

1412
01:23:14,860 --> 01:23:18,560
A little less than a year. I've been
divorced about nine months.

1413
01:23:18,740 --> 01:23:20,330
We worked together. You know that?

1414
01:23:20,490 --> 01:23:22,150
Yeah. I heard that.

1415
01:23:23,410 --> 01:23:25,320
What was that like?

1416
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:28,460
It was great in the beginning.

1417
01:23:28,630 --> 01:23:31,830
Then it changed, became competitive.

1418
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:35,870
Suddenly, the better I did,
the worse we did.

1419
01:23:36,050 --> 01:23:40,340
The price I pay for being me.
I know that now. No...

1420
01:23:40,510 --> 01:23:42,920
Truly. No, no. It's true.

1421
01:23:45,560 --> 01:23:47,550
Do you want to know all this?

1422
01:23:47,730 --> 01:23:49,230
Keep going.

1423
01:23:52,190 --> 01:23:56,850
That's why I needed to get out
there on my own - scary as it was.

1424
01:23:57,650 --> 01:23:59,640
I mean, not scary, but um...

1425
01:24:01,650 --> 01:24:03,860
Well, yeah, I was kind of scared.

1426
01:24:04,030 --> 01:24:05,450
Why?

1427
01:24:05,620 --> 01:24:07,120
I don't know.

1428
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:09,910
Guess I wasn't sure
I could do the job.

1429
01:24:10,080 --> 01:24:11,960
I mean, I thought I could do it,

1430
01:24:12,120 --> 01:24:15,160
but I'm finding Sloane Curtis
a tougher place to navigate

1431
01:24:15,330 --> 01:24:18,370
than I thought. I'm sorry.

1432
01:24:18,540 --> 01:24:22,210
This is insensitive of me.
I know you were up for my job.

1433
01:24:22,380 --> 01:24:24,460
I'm sorry I'm the one that got it.

1434
01:24:24,630 --> 01:24:26,460
I'm not. I'm not.

1435
01:24:26,630 --> 01:24:28,460
I've learned a lot from you.

1436
01:24:28,640 --> 01:24:30,100
Like what?

1437
01:24:30,260 --> 01:24:32,720
Well, for starters,
you really love what you do.

1438
01:24:32,890 --> 01:24:35,220
- You really love what you do.
- Not as much as you.

1439
01:24:35,390 --> 01:24:39,090
Don't say that. You're so great
at it. So great at it.

1440
01:24:39,270 --> 01:24:42,070
I think Dan's even wondering
why he hired me.

1441
01:24:42,230 --> 01:24:46,490
Really. I think the bloom
is definitely off the rose.

1442
01:24:49,450 --> 01:24:51,410
Want to hear something great?

1443
01:24:51,570 --> 01:24:52,950
Yeah.

1444
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:56,080
I just closed escrow
on my first apartment ever.

1445
01:24:56,660 --> 01:24:58,740
Finally, I own my own place.

1446
01:25:01,250 --> 01:25:05,000
What? Now I wish
I was a mind reader.

1447
01:25:05,170 --> 01:25:13,540
I was just thinking...how men
like me can get so screwed up.

1448
01:25:15,850 --> 01:25:18,060
I don't think there are men like you.

1449
01:25:19,430 --> 01:25:21,810
If we kissed,
would it ruin everything?

1450
01:25:24,060 --> 01:25:25,440
Listen to me.

1451
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:29,150
I think...

1452
01:25:30,150 --> 01:25:32,860
you're one of the great women.
I really do...

1453
01:25:41,740 --> 01:25:43,120
I'm sorry.

1454
01:25:45,200 --> 01:25:47,580
I just meant to say thank you.

1455
01:25:48,920 --> 01:25:50,290
I'm so sorry.

1456
01:26:23,110 --> 01:26:25,950
(NICK) Well, I guess I'll see you...

1457
01:26:27,370 --> 01:26:29,190
in three and a half hours!

1458
01:26:33,040 --> 01:26:37,330
Nick, may I just say that you are
an exceptionally great kisser.

1459
01:26:39,250 --> 01:26:41,460
No. I mean really, really great.

1460
01:26:42,130 --> 01:26:45,500
I haven't had this much fun
making out since...

1461
01:26:49,300 --> 01:26:51,680
I've never had this much fun
making out.

1462
01:26:51,850 --> 01:26:53,220
Me either.

1463
01:26:54,680 --> 01:26:56,670
Don't let this get weird at work.

1464
01:26:56,850 --> 01:26:58,760
We've nothing
to be embarrassed about.

1465
01:26:58,940 --> 01:27:00,650
We made out.

1466
01:27:02,230 --> 01:27:03,730
You and I made out.

1467
01:27:05,110 --> 01:27:07,150
And if I may, it was...

1468
01:27:07,320 --> 01:27:08,740
Sexy as hell.

1469
01:27:09,950 --> 01:27:12,410
God, that's just
what I was about to say.

1470
01:27:12,570 --> 01:27:15,330
Oh, I think I said it first.
I think.

1471
01:27:15,490 --> 01:27:17,080
No, you did.

1472
01:27:19,450 --> 01:27:20,960
Well, all right.

1473
01:27:28,960 --> 01:27:31,630
Oh, I'm a grown woman.
Just say it.

1474
01:27:31,800 --> 01:27:35,220
Do you want to come back
to my place? Say it.

1475
01:27:35,380 --> 01:27:37,040
Do you want to come...?

1476
01:27:37,220 --> 01:27:38,960
Goodnight, Darcy.

1477
01:27:40,350 --> 01:27:41,930
Goodnight.

1478
01:27:59,110 --> 01:28:00,530
Goodnight.

1479
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,210
What am I doing?

1480
01:28:27,810 --> 01:28:29,430
Lola.

1481
01:28:33,850 --> 01:28:35,650
Here he comes. OK.

1482
01:28:36,690 --> 01:28:38,110
Lola?

1483
01:28:38,270 --> 01:28:40,980
I know I haven't heard from you.

1484
01:28:41,150 --> 01:28:42,890
How long have you been out here?

1485
01:28:43,070 --> 01:28:45,450
Just a few hours.

1486
01:28:45,610 --> 01:28:48,450
Nick, you said
that you wouldn't hurt me.

1487
01:28:48,620 --> 01:28:52,040
And then you slept with me, and then
you didn't call me for six days.

1488
01:28:52,200 --> 01:28:54,580
In the world of "Me", that's torture.

1489
01:28:54,750 --> 01:28:59,210
I mean, we have this totally
unbelievable life-altering sex

1490
01:28:59,380 --> 01:29:01,120
and then you just disappear!

1491
01:29:01,290 --> 01:29:03,090
You stopped drinking coffee!

1492
01:29:03,250 --> 01:29:06,090
Lola, I'm so sorry.

1493
01:29:06,260 --> 01:29:07,630
It's OK.

1494
01:29:08,220 --> 01:29:10,840
It's OK because I figured out
your little secret.

1495
01:29:11,010 --> 01:29:13,300
- You did?
- It's so obvious.

1496
01:29:13,470 --> 01:29:15,550
How else would you know
the things you know?

1497
01:29:15,720 --> 01:29:17,710
It wasn't obvious to anybody else.

1498
01:29:17,890 --> 01:29:19,270
Nick, come on.

1499
01:29:19,430 --> 01:29:21,180
You're so sensitive.

1500
01:29:21,350 --> 01:29:24,150
You're so aware of my feelings.
You're so tuned in.

1501
01:29:24,310 --> 01:29:28,320
You talk to me like a woman,
you think like a woman.

1502
01:29:28,480 --> 01:29:32,190
Nick, admit it.
You're totally and completely gay.

1503
01:29:32,950 --> 01:29:34,320
I am?

1504
01:29:34,490 --> 01:29:37,940
You're not? If you're not,
you've got to tell me.

1505
01:29:38,120 --> 01:29:40,580
Tell me, because
based on the other night...

1506
01:29:40,750 --> 01:29:44,030
Just put me out of my misery.
Are you or aren't you?

1507
01:29:44,210 --> 01:29:45,920
Say you're gay, then I'm not nuts,

1508
01:29:46,080 --> 01:29:48,630
not undesirable,
not rejected by another guy.

1509
01:29:48,790 --> 01:29:51,120
-Just say it! Admit it!
- OK.

1510
01:30:00,850 --> 01:30:02,350
I'm gay.

1511
01:30:03,850 --> 01:30:05,390
How gay?

1512
01:30:06,730 --> 01:30:10,260
Oh... I'm as gay as it gets.

1513
01:30:14,110 --> 01:30:16,350
You'll make some guy very happy
some day.

1514
01:30:16,530 --> 01:30:18,180
Oh, from your lips.

1515
01:30:20,780 --> 01:30:22,820
God, I hate that I'm crying.

1516
01:30:22,990 --> 01:30:25,790
Well, look...

1517
01:30:26,740 --> 01:30:29,290
if things should ever change
in that department...

1518
01:30:29,460 --> 01:30:31,750
- You'll be the first to know.
- You promise?

1519
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:34,540
Oh, yeah. I promise. Come here.

1520
01:30:50,060 --> 01:30:51,430
Oh, boy.

1521
01:30:56,940 --> 01:30:58,680
It was very nice to meet you, Nick.

1522
01:30:58,860 --> 01:31:01,010
- And you.
- Thanks for pip talk, yes?

1523
01:31:01,190 --> 01:31:03,680
You two just take care
of each other.

1524
01:31:03,860 --> 01:31:07,030
- Thanks for the yarmulka.
- No problem. You wear it well, yes?

1525
01:31:07,200 --> 01:31:08,780
Happy trails, kids.

1526
01:31:10,070 --> 01:31:11,450
Darcy!

1527
01:31:14,330 --> 01:31:15,910
I need to talk to you.

1528
01:31:16,080 --> 01:31:19,780
Oh, look at him. I knew it.
He is weird about it.

1529
01:31:20,830 --> 01:31:24,000
This is not about last night.
It's about the Nike meeting.

1530
01:31:24,170 --> 01:31:28,300
I honestly believe in my gut that you
should make the pitch to them.

1531
01:31:28,470 --> 01:31:31,010
God. I guilted you
into this last night, didn't I?

1532
01:31:31,180 --> 01:31:33,170
No. It would just be better
if you did it.

1533
01:31:33,340 --> 01:31:35,390
No, no. This is your baby.

1534
01:31:35,560 --> 01:31:37,710
I've got to go meet these folks.
See you in there.

1535
01:31:38,560 --> 01:31:40,220
It's not my baby.

1536
01:31:40,390 --> 01:31:42,020
Yes, it is.

1537
01:31:47,020 --> 01:31:51,150
I predict no one will know I'm gone
until the files start to build.

1538
01:31:51,320 --> 01:31:53,560
It could be days.

1539
01:31:54,860 --> 01:31:56,940
Then someone will finally ask,

1540
01:31:57,120 --> 01:32:00,400
"Where's the geek in the glasses
who carries all the files?"

1541
01:32:05,290 --> 01:32:08,490
Do either of you know the story
on this Erin girl?

1542
01:32:08,670 --> 01:32:10,910
Miss Lonely Hearts? Who knows?

1543
01:32:11,090 --> 01:32:13,330
I know. She's been here two years.

1544
01:32:13,510 --> 01:32:15,830
She tried to be a copywriter
but got turned down,

1545
01:32:16,010 --> 01:32:17,380
so she's a messenger.

1546
01:32:17,550 --> 01:32:20,040
- What fool turned her down?
- You did, sire.

1547
01:32:21,640 --> 01:32:24,810
Well, did I ever meet with her
at least?

1548
01:32:24,970 --> 01:32:28,060
I don't think so. As I recall,
you told me to "Blow her off".

1549
01:32:28,230 --> 01:32:32,310
Well, I want to meet with her now.
The kid's got something kinda funny.

1550
01:32:32,480 --> 01:32:34,020
This is your lucky day, pal.

1551
01:32:34,190 --> 01:32:38,490
I saw the Nike group. All women.
Your specialty. I'll walk you up.

1552
01:32:38,650 --> 01:32:40,560
I hate what I'm doing to Darcy.

1553
01:32:40,740 --> 01:32:42,810
I'm going to write her a long letter.

1554
01:32:42,990 --> 01:32:44,370
You're doing Darcy? Since when?

1555
01:32:44,530 --> 01:32:48,040
No. I hate what I'm doing to Darcy.
Men are stupider. It's true.

1556
01:32:48,200 --> 01:32:49,750
- Would you stop it?
- They are.

1557
01:32:49,910 --> 01:32:52,070
"They"? Are you officially
a woman now?

1558
01:32:52,250 --> 01:32:55,780
I wish. A woman wouldn't have
screwed over the woman she loved.

1559
01:32:55,960 --> 01:32:58,990
And you know this whole thing
about penis envy?

1560
01:32:59,170 --> 01:33:00,550
- Yeah.
- Not true.

1561
01:33:00,710 --> 01:33:03,210
They don't envy.
Half of them don't even like it!

1562
01:33:03,380 --> 01:33:05,010
You know who has penis envy? We do.

1563
01:33:05,180 --> 01:33:07,170
That's why we cheat and screw up.

1564
01:33:07,340 --> 01:33:09,420
We're obsessed
with our own equipment.

1565
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:11,890
- Are you ready?
- Yup. Thanks.

1566
01:33:15,350 --> 01:33:18,230
(NICK) You don't stand in front
of a mirror before a run

1567
01:33:18,400 --> 01:33:21,680
and wonder what the road
will think of your outfit.

1568
01:33:21,860 --> 01:33:24,530
You don't have to listen to its
jokes and pretend they're funny

1569
01:33:24,690 --> 01:33:26,110
in order to run on it.

1570
01:33:26,280 --> 01:33:30,410
It would not be easier to run
if you dressed sexier.

1571
01:33:30,570 --> 01:33:33,490
The road doesn't notice
if you're not wearing lipstick.

1572
01:33:33,660 --> 01:33:35,900
Does not care how old you are.

1573
01:33:36,080 --> 01:33:37,820
You do not feel uncomfortable

1574
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:39,900
because you make more money
than the road.

1575
01:33:40,080 --> 01:33:44,090
And you can call on the road
whenever you feel like it.

1576
01:33:44,250 --> 01:33:48,710
Whether it's been a day, or a couple
of hours since your last date.

1577
01:33:50,970 --> 01:33:55,510
The only thing the road cares about
is that you visit once in a while.

1578
01:33:56,430 --> 01:33:57,810
Nike.

1579
01:33:57,970 --> 01:34:01,230
No games. Just sports.

1580
01:34:05,270 --> 01:34:08,060
-He nailed it.
-They hit a home run.

1581
01:34:08,230 --> 01:34:10,530
Where do we sign?

Why are you not the happiest guy
in Chicago right now? You did great.

1595
01:35:01,610 --> 01:35:05,060
No, I didn't do so great.
We did so...

1596
01:35:05,240 --> 01:35:08,270
No, actually... You did so great.

1597
01:35:08,450 --> 01:35:11,650
You. Me. We did great.

1598
01:35:12,870 --> 01:35:16,370
Will you come with me someplace?
I want to show you something.

1599
01:35:16,540 --> 01:35:18,870
- I have something I need to finish.
- Please?

1600
01:35:20,420 --> 01:35:21,840
Please.

1601
01:35:33,310 --> 01:35:35,600
OK. Here you go.

1602
01:35:38,350 --> 01:35:40,230
- Come with me.
- All right.

1603
01:35:40,400 --> 01:35:42,360
- Should I close my eyes?
- No.

1604
01:35:43,770 --> 01:35:47,190
So, you see those top two floors
right there?

1605
01:35:47,360 --> 01:35:48,740
I do.

1606
01:35:50,360 --> 01:35:52,070
All mine.

1607
01:35:52,240 --> 01:35:55,830
- Wow.
- I know. Come here.

1608
01:36:00,460 --> 01:36:02,670
So this is my...

1609
01:36:16,260 --> 01:36:18,140
..living room.

1610
01:36:19,140 --> 01:36:20,680
It's beautiful.

1611
01:36:47,960 --> 01:36:49,780
What are you thinking?

1612
01:36:52,080 --> 01:36:54,880
You've got that look
you have sometimes.

1613
01:36:55,050 --> 01:36:56,760
Yeah?

1614
01:36:56,920 --> 01:36:59,410
I was just wondering
when you get to move in.

1615
01:36:59,590 --> 01:37:01,670
Well, they said two weeks, so...

1616
01:37:02,800 --> 01:37:05,040
OK. This is the dining room.

1617
01:37:07,810 --> 01:37:10,770
The fireplace works. Come here.

1618
01:37:10,930 --> 01:37:13,770
I can see elegant parties in here.

1619
01:37:13,940 --> 01:37:16,810
Waiters with caviar,
you in a beautiful gown.

1620
01:37:16,980 --> 01:37:18,400
You can see all that?

1621
01:37:18,570 --> 01:37:21,770
Maybe you're naked and I'm the only
guest, but it would be elegant.

1622
01:37:21,940 --> 01:37:23,990
OK. So this is upstairs.

1623
01:37:24,150 --> 01:37:27,610
There's a second bedroom
for a future office or whatever.

1624
01:37:29,450 --> 01:37:32,410
And this is my boudoir.

1625
01:37:33,330 --> 01:37:36,120
(FAINT MUSIC: "NIGHT AND DAY"
BY THE TEMPTATIONS)

1626
01:37:36,290 --> 01:37:38,700
Your boudoir comes
with pretty decent music.

1627
01:37:38,880 --> 01:37:41,790
It does. Where's that coming from?

1628
01:37:41,960 --> 01:37:46,540
# No matter, darling, where you are

1629
01:37:46,720 --> 01:37:49,180
# I think of you... #

1630
01:37:51,140 --> 01:37:53,010
Let's turn up the volume.

1631
01:37:57,060 --> 01:37:59,190
# Day and night... #

1632
01:37:59,350 --> 01:38:01,150
So where's your bed going?

1633
01:38:03,190 --> 01:38:05,730
Right here.

1634
01:38:08,610 --> 01:38:12,560
# That this longing for you follows

1635
01:38:12,740 --> 01:38:15,740
# Wherever I go

1636
01:38:18,830 --> 01:38:23,210
# In the roaring traffic's boom... #

1637

I like it here.

01:38:45,680 --> 01:38:47,310
I like it here too.

01:38:47,480 --> 01:38:48,850
No.

1642
01:38:49,020 --> 01:38:51,100
I mean I like it here.

1643
01:38:52,730 --> 01:38:54,280
Oh.

# Night and day. #

- Dan?
- Yeah.

1652
01:39:32,350 --> 01:39:34,430
- I've got to talk to you.
- Bye.

1653
01:39:34,600 --> 01:39:38,520
That was Nike. They're going
to announce we've won the account.

1654
01:39:38,690 --> 01:39:42,690
I gotta hand it to you. You saved
my ass! You save the company's ass!

1655
01:39:42,860 --> 01:39:45,650
I had very little to do
with saving anybody's ass.

1656
01:39:45,820 --> 01:39:48,310
It's Darcy you should be thanking.

1657
01:39:48,490 --> 01:39:51,770
Darcy? I was there yesterday.
She didn't open her mouth.

1658
01:39:51,950 --> 01:39:54,500
I'm big enough
to admit when I screw up.

1659
01:39:54,660 --> 01:39:56,990
I looked at the marketplace
and I panicked.

1660
01:39:57,160 --> 01:40:00,330
Nick, forgive me.
I want you to step in here.

1661
01:40:00,500 --> 01:40:03,040
No, Dan. You did the right thing
when you hired her.

1662
01:40:03,210 --> 01:40:06,910
She is the best creative director
I have ever seen. Bar none.

1663
01:40:07,090 --> 01:40:08,830
This isn't...? I know she's adorable.

1664
01:40:09,010 --> 01:40:11,250
- Yeah.
- This isn't about that, is it?

1665
01:40:11,430 --> 01:40:13,140
No. Not like that. No.

1666
01:40:13,300 --> 01:40:17,560
Please, look... I've been doing
a lot of listening lately,

1667
01:40:17,720 --> 01:40:22,850
and I've decided I need to take a
leave of absence. I need to get away

1668
01:40:23,020 --> 01:40:25,100
- and get some perspective.
- Are you nuts?

1669
01:40:25,270 --> 01:40:27,010
What is this? What do you mean?

1670
01:40:27,190 --> 01:40:30,070
This is the biggest account
this company has ever landed.

1671
01:40:30,240 --> 01:40:33,270
- You want nobody running the shop?
- Darcy's here!

1672
01:40:33,450 --> 01:40:36,900
For somebody who listens a lot,
you don't hear so well.

1673
01:40:37,070 --> 01:40:39,320
I had a meeting with her today.
We had a talk.

1674
01:40:39,490 --> 01:40:42,940
Oh, Dan! You didn't.
Tell me you didn't fire her.

1675
01:40:43,120 --> 01:40:44,710
She didn't even put up a fight.

1676
01:40:44,870 --> 01:40:46,700
- Oh!
- She's gone, pal.

1677
01:40:46,870 --> 01:40:48,620
No, no. It's not too late.

1678
01:40:48,790 --> 01:40:51,170
Call her. Tell her
you need her back. Hire her back.

1679
01:40:51,340 --> 01:40:54,010
- Calm down. I can't do that.
- Why?

1680
01:40:54,170 --> 01:40:57,340
I talked to the board and told them
I don't need her any more.

1681
01:40:57,510 --> 01:41:00,960
They offered her a settlement and
she took it. Besides, Nike want you.

1682
01:41:01,140 --> 01:41:02,760
You're what they bought!

1683
01:41:02,930 --> 01:41:06,210
I've got to deliver! I can...
Would you come out for one second?

1684
01:41:06,390 --> 01:41:08,380
My job is to deliver you.

1685
01:41:08,560 --> 01:41:11,480
Dan, Nike bought an idea.
It wasn't even mine!

1686
01:41:11,650 --> 01:41:14,440
Every idea that they loved
yesterday came from her.

1687
01:41:14,610 --> 01:41:17,100
If you don't get Darcy McGuire
back in here pronto,

1688
01:41:17,280 --> 01:41:19,320
the board is going to be paying
your settlement.

1689
01:41:19,490 --> 01:41:22,360
This is about saving your ass,
right? Save it.

1690
01:41:30,830 --> 01:41:34,500
Annie, get hold of Darcy's address

Hey. Did you get hold of Darcy?

No? Well, keep trying.

you did anything to hurt yourself.

do something to hurt myself?

Here's the thing, Erin.

1756
01:48:17,060 --> 01:48:19,940
I'm here because, as you know,
we have the Nike account,

1757
01:48:20,110 --> 01:48:22,230
and we have a job opening
in our team.

were discussing, you know,

who could be great enough
to fill that void,

1760

and your name popped into my head,

for a job as a copywriter.

Yeah. I tried, but you were
unavailable and then out of town...

01:54:24,970 --> 01:54:28,720
That clown made out with a girl
with a tongue ring over you?

1847
01:54:31,940 --> 01:54:33,310
Honey...

1848
01:54:34,690 --> 01:54:36,850
you look beautiful.

1849
01:54:39,230 --> 01:54:40,650
Thanks.

1850
01:54:47,620 --> 01:54:49,690
Take me home, Dad.

1851
01:55:44,370 --> 01:55:47,630
What am I doing?
She's not in the refrigerator.

1852
01:56:03,390 --> 01:56:05,940
I wonder if it's too late
to go over there.

1853
01:56:06,100 --> 01:56:09,390
Of course it's not. It's never
too late to do the right thing.

1854
01:56:09,560 --> 01:56:12,520
I'll go over there
and do the right thing.

(INTERCOM BUZZES)

1856
01:56:24,740 --> 01:56:26,120
Hello?

1857
01:56:26,290 --> 01:56:28,110
Ah, hi. It's me.

1858
01:56:28,290 --> 01:56:29,790
I'm glad I found you.

1859
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:33,670
Ah, can I come up?

1860
01:56:35,840 --> 01:56:37,210
Darcy?

1861
01:56:37,380 --> 01:56:39,760
I need to...
(DOOR BUZZES)

1862
01:56:42,970 --> 01:56:44,880
Hey.

1863
01:56:45,050 --> 01:56:47,210
You need to what?
It's one in the morning.

1864
01:56:47,390 --> 01:56:49,770
I need to talk to you.

1865
01:56:49,930 --> 01:56:51,480
OK.

1866
01:56:53,480 --> 01:56:54,850
Thanks.

1867
01:56:58,480 --> 01:57:00,440
So, you sleep here now?

1868
01:57:00,610 --> 01:57:04,230
Well, I thought I'd give it a try
before I have to sell the place.

1869
01:57:04,400 --> 01:57:06,060
Sell it? You're not selling it?

1870
01:57:06,240 --> 01:57:08,480
I can't afford to keep it.
I don't have a job.

1871
01:57:08,660 --> 01:57:11,660
You ought to try returning
some of your phone calls.

1872
01:57:11,830 --> 01:57:13,240
You got your job back.

1873
01:57:13,410 --> 01:57:16,860
Do I? You're a real riot,
you know that?

1874
01:57:17,040 --> 01:57:19,580
It's true. Dan told me so himself.

1875
01:57:19,750 --> 01:57:22,780
Why would he? I didn't do the job
that he hired me to do.

1876
01:57:22,960 --> 01:57:24,920
I don't blame him for firing me.

1877
01:57:25,090 --> 01:57:27,000
Look, I'm er...

1878
01:57:27,170 --> 01:57:30,290
Come on in. I don't have
any chairs, but if you want to...

1879
01:57:30,470 --> 01:57:34,220
What if I told you that you did
everything you were hired to do,

1880
01:57:34,390 --> 01:57:35,810
everything,

1881
01:57:35,970 --> 01:57:39,060
but that someone was sabotaging you.

1882
01:57:40,140 --> 01:57:42,850
Picking your brain,
swiping your ideas...

1883
01:57:44,520 --> 01:57:47,320
and you never even knew
what hit you.

1884
01:57:47,480 --> 01:57:49,780
How is that possible?

1885
01:57:49,940 --> 01:57:51,570
Oh, trust me. It's possible.

1886
01:57:51,740 --> 01:57:53,700
Who would do such an awful thing?

1887
01:57:56,620 --> 01:57:58,080
I would.

1888
01:58:02,080 --> 01:58:05,080
I was a dope with a corner office,

1889
01:58:05,250 --> 01:58:08,780
and when you came with the job
I was supposed to have...

1890
01:58:08,960 --> 01:58:12,460
I mean,
it didn't matter to me that...

1891
01:58:13,710 --> 01:58:16,260
you were better at it than me
or you earned it,

1892
01:58:16,430 --> 01:58:20,380
I felt it was mine, and I was going
to do anything to get it back.

1893
01:58:20,550 --> 01:58:25,050
And so I took advantage of you
in the worst possible way.

1894
01:58:28,640 --> 01:58:30,850
Have you ever done that?

1895
01:58:31,020 --> 01:58:33,980
Taken the wrong road?
No, of course you haven't.

1896
01:58:34,150 --> 01:58:36,030
You wouldn't do that.

1897
01:58:37,530 --> 01:58:39,570
Somebody like me does that.

1898
01:58:39,740 --> 01:58:45,410
And er...the problem was that while
I was digging a hole under you...

1899
01:58:48,790 --> 01:58:51,000
I found out all about you.

1900
01:58:51,620 --> 01:58:56,530
And the more I found out...
the more you dazzled me.

1901
01:58:58,340 --> 01:59:02,750
I mean, shook my world,
changed my life, dazzled me.

1902
01:59:04,180 --> 01:59:06,970
And guys like that ex-husband
of yours, I mean,

1903
01:59:07,140 --> 01:59:12,600
he made you feel that the price
you pay just for being you

1904
01:59:12,770 --> 01:59:14,810
is that you don't get to have love.

1905
01:59:14,980 --> 01:59:17,730
Isn't that what you were trying
to say the other night?

1906
01:59:17,900 --> 01:59:22,310
That you weren't complete? That you
weren't really a winner like that?

1907
01:59:23,820 --> 01:59:28,030
Everything about you - how smart
you are, how good you are...

1908
01:59:28,990 --> 01:59:32,160
Everything just makes me
want you even more.

1909
01:59:36,910 --> 01:59:39,290
Oh, boy.

1910
01:59:39,460 --> 01:59:42,660
It looks like I'm here at one
in the morning being all heroic,

1911
01:59:42,840 --> 01:59:44,460
trying to rescue you.

1912
01:59:45,550 --> 01:59:46,920
But the truth is...

1913
01:59:48,380 --> 01:59:51,130
I'm the one that needs to be rescued.

1914
01:59:57,180 --> 01:59:59,890
I sure wish I could read your mind.

1915
02:00:07,650 --> 02:00:10,030
Well, I was thinking that um...

1916
02:00:11,530 --> 02:00:14,020
if everything you're saying is true,

1917
02:00:14,200 --> 02:00:17,980
if I really have my job back...

1918
02:00:23,410 --> 02:00:25,710
then I think you're fired.

1919
02:00:30,590 --> 02:00:33,500
I never really thought about it
from that angle.

1920
02:00:36,800 --> 02:00:40,580
Well, not that I don't deserve it.
I..d-d-d...

1921
02:00:41,680 --> 02:00:43,140
I'm stuttering.

1922
02:00:55,570 --> 02:01:01,200
Now I feel kind of embarrassed that
I told you I needed to be rescued.

1923
02:01:03,530 --> 02:01:04,910
That's fine.

1924
02:01:19,550 --> 02:01:21,170
(DARCY) That's it?

1925
02:01:26,840 --> 02:01:28,920
I don't want that to be it.

1926
02:01:29,100 --> 02:01:31,670
I don't want that to be it at all.

1927
02:01:31,850 --> 02:01:35,980
Then don't let a little thing
like me firing you stand in your way.

1928
02:01:40,020 --> 02:01:42,430
I didn't know
what to react to first.

1929
02:01:43,570 --> 02:01:47,980
Hey, newsflash.
I took the wrong road.

1930
02:01:49,410 --> 02:01:52,610
What kind of knight
in shining armour would I be

1931
02:01:52,780 --> 02:01:55,900
if the man I love needs rescuing

1932
02:01:56,080 --> 02:01:58,400
and I just let him walk out my door?

1933
02:02:06,460 --> 02:02:07,920
