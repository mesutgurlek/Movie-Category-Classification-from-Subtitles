00:07:58,077 --> 00:07:59,544
I'm enjoying our
non-sex period,
that's all I'm saying.

159
00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:00,803
Don't you miss it?

160
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:03,211
I wouldn't know, because
I don't have any
feeling down there anymore.

161
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:04,579
I have nerve damage
from my C-section,

162
00:08:04,717 --> 00:08:06,048
so everything's
just kind of...
(WHlSTLES)

163
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:07,952
She's numb down there.

164
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,180
I could sit down
hard on a fire hydrant,

165
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:15,159
and I wouldn't even
know that I was sitting.

166
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:18,625
I could get stung by
a hornet down there,
and I would not feel it.

167
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:21,758
You could put
anything in there,

168
00:08:22,134 --> 00:08:24,568
and I would not know
what the object was.

169
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:26,635
I used to pee
in a nice stream,

170
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:29,072
and now it just kind of goes
like a shower head.

171

That is the saddest
thing I've ever heard.

172

I think you need a family.
Don't you want a family?

No, I think
I want to Clooney it.

Yup.

175
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:39,377
He doesn't seem happy.

00:08:40,152 --> 00:08:41,141
Yeah, he is.

177
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,812
No, he's lonely.

178
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:43,947
No, he's not.

179
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:46,856
See, I think
he has sad eyes.

180
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:49,118
You sweet little thing, no.

181
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:52,426
He's doing sad, lonely eyes
to get the next lady.

182

Look, I can do it, too.
Watch.

183
00:08:56,769 --> 00:08:58,828
I bet George Clooney
is really lonely.

Just him and his pig.

185

You'd fuck him.
I wouldn't.

So would you.
I would.

I wouldn't feel it,
but I would.

188
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,936
You'd fuck him
with your numb vagina.
Yes, you would.

I mean,
that was idiotic, though.
You have to understand that.

192

That's the one
thing you don't do,

193
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:19,451
is tell her that
you used Viagra.

194
00:09:19,525 --> 00:09:21,288
I think that's even
on the warning label.

195
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:23,888
We're in one of
those phases where

everything that
the other person says

197
00:09:26,532 --> 00:09:28,432
just annoys
the shit out of each other.

All the time. It's a blast.
Don't worry about it.

ride that out.

Okay, I like it.

But...

203
00:09:38,177 --> 00:09:41,408
Do you ever wonder
what it would be like if, say,

204
00:09:41,814 --> 00:09:45,079
you were separated
by something bigger.

205
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:47,642
Like death? Like her death?

206

I have given it
a fair amount of thought.

207
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:55,886
Not in a painful way,
just quietly slid into death.

208
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:57,122
Like a gas leak.

00:09:57,229 --> 00:09:59,026
Absolutely.
It's gotta be peaceful.

No, I'd want it
to be a peaceful...

into a coma from which
she never awakens.

And then you move on.
Then you are a widower.

That's just it,
people love widowers.

217

They love widowers.
It's like the polar
opposite of divorced guys.

It's the best.

219
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:19,512
It's like,
"Oh, that poor widower.

"lf I could only
make him happy."

"Somehow, ease his pain."

it's about a Salvador Dali

fucked you once,

467
00:22:34,786 --> 00:22:36,777
if you could
have finished.
Oh. I finished.

468
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:39,790
Okay, enough of
who fucked who
and who finished what.

469
00:22:39,891 --> 00:22:41,153
I finished.

470
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,456
Look, it's a retro label.
That's our niche,
that's our market.

471
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:47,396
It costs money to
break new bands.
I can't do that.

472
00:22:47,466 --> 00:22:49,764
Okay, and also,
you're the guy who
turned down Arcade Fire.

473
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:51,368
Everybody turned
down Arcade Fire.

474
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:52,869
It's crazy.
There's so many of them.

475
00:22:52,938 --> 00:22:54,269
We don't have the money
to market a new band.

476
00:22:54,639 --> 00:22:57,369
We just need to make
Graham seem relevant.

477
00:22:57,976 --> 00:22:58,965
Who's he talking to?

478
00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:00,237
The Jewish Journal.

479
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:02,206
The Jewish Journal?

480
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:06,808
Apparently, old Jews
are the only ones who still
buy hard copy of records.

481
00:23:07,152 --> 00:23:08,847
Because they don't
like to download music.

482
00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:11,319
Because they don't know
what "downloading" means.

483
00:23:12,491 --> 00:23:15,324
Why is this album
different from
any other album?

484
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:17,153
It isn't.

485
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:18,418
What is he wearing?

486
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,197
It's a hat with
the Oreo logo on it.

487
00:23:20,699 --> 00:23:22,360
Why?
I don't think
he's being ironic.

488
00:23:22,467 --> 00:23:23,661
I think he just
really likes Oreos.

489
00:23:25,137 --> 00:23:26,570
Look, Paul Westerberg
record did okay.

490
00:23:26,705 --> 00:23:28,172
Frank Black record
did all right.

491
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,707
The Haircut One Hundred,
not so much.

492
00:23:29,775 --> 00:23:32,209
We have to break
this record. Otherwise,
we're not here next year.

493
00:23:32,377 --> 00:23:34,140
He's coming, he's coming.
Oreo Man is coming.

494
00:23:34,212 --> 00:23:35,304
Hey, guys, how are you?

495
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:36,438
Good, man.

496
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:38,210
Aren't cookies the best?
Yeah.

497
00:23:38,717 --> 00:23:41,151
Jewish Journal guy
loves the record.

498
00:23:41,219 --> 00:23:42,243
Great!

499
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,686
Got a bit of
a problem, though.
A touch of gout.

500
00:23:45,323 --> 00:23:46,381
Gout?

501
00:23:46,491 --> 00:23:49,016
My whole family,
they all had gout.

502
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:51,722
Jesus.
That's very unfortunate.

503
00:23:51,797 --> 00:23:54,994
My auntie Queenie,
she had a foot like this.

504
00:23:55,066 --> 00:23:57,967
It's like a size
of a small pig.
I've got a photo of it.

505
00:23:58,136 --> 00:24:00,570
I'd love to see that
photo of that gout foot.

506
00:24:00,739 --> 00:24:02,297
And a couple of
bunions as well.

507
00:24:02,374 --> 00:24:03,398
Fuck.

508
00:24:03,475 --> 00:24:05,033
I've got to go
to the podiatrist,

509
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,702
and I hope he can
shoot me up with something.

510
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:09,178
Yeah, well, let's get
you to the podiatrist.

511
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:12,110
Bye, Graham.
See you later, Graham.

512
00:24:12,317 --> 00:24:13,614
Good luck with your gout.

513
00:24:13,685 --> 00:24:15,050
Rock and roll, baby.

514
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:20,414
The happiest period
in people's lives
is from age 40 to 60.

515
00:24:20,492 --> 00:24:23,655
So, this is it.
We're in it right now.

516
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:25,456
It's true.
Says who?

517
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:28,226
Says a lot of people.
Most people say that.
Oh!

518
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:33,328
We have everything
we need right now
to be completely happy.

519
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:36,607
We're going to blink,
and be 90.
What?

520
00:24:36,675 --> 00:24:39,269
So, let's just
choose to be happy.

521
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:41,168
Yeah. Yeah.

522
00:24:41,246 --> 00:24:42,440
Your eyes are
kind of glazing over.

523
00:24:42,514 --> 00:24:44,141
No, I'm processing it all.

524
00:24:44,349 --> 00:24:45,611
Some of these,
I wrote for you.

525
00:24:46,785 --> 00:24:48,650
So, we have to
exercise every day.
Mmm.

526
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,517
Spend more time
alone together.

527
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:52,748
And we have to go
to the therapist, every week.

528
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:55,221
It's a little pricey.

529
00:24:55,393 --> 00:24:58,055
No stressing over tiny things.

530
00:24:58,196 --> 00:24:59,959
Yeah, that's good.
You should do that.
Mm-hmm.

531
00:25:00,098 --> 00:25:01,998
We have to get more
involved in school.

532
00:25:03,535 --> 00:25:05,298
Yeah.
Have more
patience with the kids.

533
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:07,270
And we need to
work on our anger.

534
00:25:07,405 --> 00:25:09,805
Yeah, I think it would be
good if you could take
care of your anger.

535
00:25:10,041 --> 00:25:11,167
No, I said both of us.

536
00:25:11,276 --> 00:25:12,402
That's what I said.
Our anger.

537
00:25:12,944 --> 00:25:15,174
Okay, and no more smoking.

538
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,544
Yeah, you gotta
cut that out.

539
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:20,344
I don't want to make
this about a fight.
I want to just be positive.

540
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:22,108
Yeah. Sorry.

541
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:26,123
Okay, and then no more
holding onto resentments.

542
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:28,216
We have to just let that go.

543
00:25:28,293 --> 00:25:29,954
So, you're saying
that if we're arguing,

544
00:25:30,095 --> 00:25:31,756
and I apologize,
you'll let it go?

545
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:33,195
And not throw it
back in my face later?

546
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:35,457
Well, I don't do that,

547
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:39,197
but I will continue
not to do that.

548
00:25:40,338 --> 00:25:41,635
And what did you write?

549
00:25:41,907 --> 00:25:43,772
All of that.
That's plenty.
That's a lot.

550
00:25:44,142 --> 00:25:46,372
And you're going
to eat better?

551
00:25:46,444 --> 00:25:48,605
Oh, yeah.
I've been doing
a decent job.

552
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,147
But I don't think
there's anything wrong

553
00:25:50,282 --> 00:25:51,749
with having some
fries every now and again.

554
00:25:51,983 --> 00:25:53,348
And then I'll smoke that day.

555
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:55,743
That's not the same thing.
It is the same thing.

556
00:25:55,921 --> 00:25:56,979
I like fries.

557
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:59,323
And the other thing
is your dad's stuff,

558
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:02,690
the not letting him
guilt-trip you all the time

559
00:26:02,761 --> 00:26:05,821
because that puts a lot
of pressure on you,
and stress,

560
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:07,558
and then
the whole family feels it.
(STRUMS lNSTRUMENT)

561
00:26:07,632 --> 00:26:09,862
And he is a grown man,
and he's not our
responsibility.

562
00:26:10,502 --> 00:26:12,402
And you're not giving him
money anymore, right?

563
00:26:13,872 --> 00:26:15,499
No. No, I haven't
been giving him money.

564
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:16,973
I haven't done that
for years. I told you.

565
00:26:17,275 --> 00:26:18,469
Can you please put that down?

566
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:25,573
A lot of people are RSVP-ing
to your birthday party.

567
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:27,447
You sure you don't want
to just do a joint
birthday party?

568
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:28,508
No.

569
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:29,747
We always used to.
No.

570
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:33,553
Did Jodi tell you she
thinks Desi's stealing?

571
00:26:34,192 --> 00:26:35,454
Are you serious?

572
00:26:35,527 --> 00:26:37,791
How much?
$12,000.

573
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:39,822
Oh, God.

574
00:26:40,065 --> 00:26:41,123
And Desi's taking it?

575
00:26:41,199 --> 00:26:42,359
Well, I don't know.

576
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:43,731
That's what Jodi said.

577
00:26:44,135 --> 00:26:45,762
We really need
the store to work.

578
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:48,504
It is.

579
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,637
Don't put that kind
of pressure on me.

580
00:26:51,242 --> 00:26:54,473
No, no. It's not
what I mean. I'm just...

581
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,509
Are you nervous
about money?

582
00:26:57,849 --> 00:26:59,316
Are we okay?

583
00:26:59,384 --> 00:27:01,079
Yeah.
All right.

584
00:27:02,053 --> 00:27:03,953
Maybe we just suck it up
because she's clearly

585
00:27:04,022 --> 00:27:06,456
earning so much more
than any other
employee we have.

586
00:27:06,758 --> 00:27:08,749
Oh, yeah, for sure.
We can't fire her.

587
00:27:08,893 --> 00:27:10,793
We're barely
breaking even with her.

588
00:27:10,862 --> 00:27:12,090
That's why we
have to keep her.

589
00:27:13,231 --> 00:27:15,426
Look at this.
She's making
out with somebody.

(GASPS)

591
00:27:19,537 --> 00:27:21,061
Is she screwing him?

592
00:27:21,339 --> 00:27:23,102
PETE: That might be
like a dry hump.

593
00:27:23,174 --> 00:27:25,335
DEBBlE: Look at the position
of her skirt.

594
00:27:25,944 --> 00:27:27,809
That's too grainy
to know for sure.

595
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:29,139
(GASPlNG)

596
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:32,541
Oh, my God. This is in
the middle ofthe day.
Customers could be in there.

597
00:27:32,617 --> 00:27:33,982
At least
she's getting some.

598
00:27:34,052 --> 00:27:37,249
What did you say?
"At least she's getting some"?

599
00:27:37,422 --> 00:27:38,821
(LAUGHlNG) Yes.

600
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:41,324
What are you talking about?
We had sex the other night.

601
00:27:41,393 --> 00:27:42,792
You gotta give me
a little credit for that.

602
00:27:42,894 --> 00:27:45,988
It's not about credit.
It's about...

603
00:27:46,064 --> 00:27:47,998
We need to have
more passion.

604
00:27:48,199 --> 00:27:49,359
Like this.

605
00:27:49,901 --> 00:27:51,232
That's not passionate.

606
00:27:51,302 --> 00:27:52,963
It looks
passionate to me.

607
00:27:53,071 --> 00:27:54,265
What?

00:27:54,873 --> 00:27:56,067
(FARTS)

What is she doing?
(FARTS)
Okay.

610
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:01,035
Oh, my God.

611
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:03,837
Oh, my God.
Oh, my gosh.

612
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:07,548
Don't do that.
What am I doing?

613
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:09,517
Don't fart in the bed.

614
00:28:09,654 --> 00:28:11,315
I'm not. It's the springs.

615
00:28:11,423 --> 00:28:13,152
This is why
we never have sex.

616

That's disgusting,
you're gross.

you're talking about.

I'm doing my homework.

Okay, watch this.
Watch this.

623
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:31,171
There's a haunted cow
back here.

624
00:28:31,242 --> 00:28:35,645
I'm pretty sure
it does not have milk.

See that?
They took me away.

629
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:51,390
You're no fun.
You never want to play.

630

do I have to tell you?

You're so mean
since your body
got weird.

635
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,885
Close the door.

You're no fun.

Oh, shit.

Ow. Ow.

No, my boob is in there!

642
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:29,926
Did I tell you
that my son's
going to Stanford?

643
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:33,157
No, that's great.
Great for us,
and great for him.

Do you grind your teeth?

I think we need to
turn the gas down.

Turn it up!

No, we're going to
turn it down.

doing for Christmas?

Um, I don't know.

Mm-hmm.

Isn't that fun?
In the spirit?

667
00:31:24,249 --> 00:31:25,807
Sorry, I just had
one quick question.

668
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:28,352
On your form,
you said you
were born in 1974,

669
00:31:28,419 --> 00:31:31,547
but your paper, it said '72.
So I just need to
know which it is.

670
00:31:31,623 --> 00:31:32,783
It's 1974.

671
00:31:33,424 --> 00:31:36,484
Oh, wait.
Because on your last form,

672
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:38,722
you said that you
were born in 1975.

673
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:41,490
Didn't you tell me
you were born in 1976?

674
00:31:41,666 --> 00:31:43,600
No. (LAUGHS)
That's funny.

675
00:31:43,835 --> 00:31:45,928
So, you want to
go with 1974?

676
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:50,598
I'm not gonna "go with" 1974.
It is 1974. (LAUGHS)

677
00:31:51,175 --> 00:31:52,267
Okay.

678
00:31:52,477 --> 00:31:55,037
Just remember to write
"1974" every time.

679
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:58,610
It's okay. It's 1976.

00:35:45,243 --> 00:35:46,642
I'll keep the best one.

777
00:35:46,711 --> 00:35:48,542
Really, it'll save us
both a lot of trouble.

778
00:35:48,613 --> 00:35:50,137
Come on.
Line up!

779
00:35:50,214 --> 00:35:52,341
Line up for murder! Come on!

780
00:35:53,584 --> 00:35:55,381
Who wants to be killed?
I do!

781
00:35:55,453 --> 00:35:58,820
Okay, we're eliminating
one already.
We're cheaper. You're gone.

782
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:00,448
BOY: Murder me.
Okay. Boom. Dead!

783
00:36:00,525 --> 00:36:02,220
I'm dead!
You're dead! You're dead!

784
00:36:02,293 --> 00:36:04,158
Kill me, kill me!
All right,
the kids are murdered.

785
00:36:04,228 --> 00:36:05,490
That will save us some money.
Daddy is the best!

786
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:07,522
Why would you have
three kids, anyway?

787
00:36:07,598 --> 00:36:09,429
I mean, you're 60 years old.
You have no money.

788
00:36:09,534 --> 00:36:11,798
Because Claire wanted a baby.

789
00:36:12,236 --> 00:36:14,295
If we didn't at least try,
she would have left me.

790
00:36:14,372 --> 00:36:17,808
She was 45 years old.
Nobody thought it would take.

791
00:36:17,875 --> 00:36:20,105
The doctor,
when we're doing in vitro,
is winking at me like...

792
00:36:20,211 --> 00:36:21,735
"Don't worry, don't worry."

793
00:36:21,946 --> 00:36:23,208
We were very unlucky.

794
00:36:23,281 --> 00:36:25,306
And now,
we have these three
beautiful children.

795
00:36:25,816 --> 00:36:27,477
Come on. I gotta
tell you something.

796
00:36:34,625 --> 00:36:35,614
What?

797
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:40,955
Your mother
wanted you aborted.

798
00:36:41,065 --> 00:36:42,293
Oh. Jesus Christ.

799
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:44,334
No, no. It's the truth.

800
00:36:44,969 --> 00:36:47,028
You know, it was the '70s.
We were 22 years old.

801
00:36:47,104 --> 00:36:50,835
That's what everybody did.
You did some blow,
had sex, had an abortion.

802
00:36:51,108 --> 00:36:52,439
Really?
Yes.

803
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:54,444
We were on the way to
the doctor's office.

804
00:36:54,512 --> 00:36:57,174
I said, "Let's stop,
have a pizza, talk about it.

805
00:36:57,248 --> 00:37:00,115
"lf you still wanna
do it after lunch,
it's okay."

806
00:37:00,251 --> 00:37:02,344
The pizza saved your life.

807
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:05,787
But don't give me money,
because I'm not worth it.

808
00:37:06,123 --> 00:37:08,785
So, how much
do I owe you
for saving my life?

809
00:37:08,859 --> 00:37:11,521
I don't have a number.
You just keep giving
like you're giving.

810
00:37:11,596 --> 00:37:12,585
Hey. Oh, hi, Pete.

811
00:37:12,663 --> 00:37:13,721
Hey.
Hey.

812
00:37:13,798 --> 00:37:14,992
Why aren't you
playing with the kids?

813
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:16,829
We were playing
all day with them.

814
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:20,997
Pete is just talking to me
about his 40th birthday party.

815
00:37:21,105 --> 00:37:22,595
Whatever I can do to help.

816
00:37:22,673 --> 00:37:24,004
Okay. Did you feed them?

817
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:25,633
I fed half of one.

818
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:27,041
Half of...

819
00:37:27,111 --> 00:37:29,079
Let's go, we'll feed them.
Mommy will feed them.

820

(AlRPLANE FLYlNG OVERHEAD)

821
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:33,706
Who wants tuna with
a side ofjet fuel?

822
00:37:37,021 --> 00:37:40,980
Hi, I'm looking for my dad.
I mean, an older man.

823
00:37:53,004 --> 00:37:55,529
So, how's Sony treating Pete?

824
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:58,742
He's not with Sony anymore.
He went out on his own.

825
00:37:59,477 --> 00:38:02,207
Now he's able to
focus on the artists

826
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,077
that he's really
passionate about.

827
00:38:04,181 --> 00:38:05,307
Hmm.

828
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:07,045
How's Sadie doing?

829
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:10,417
The last time I saw her,
she was throwing her
Cheerios on the floor.

830
00:38:10,488 --> 00:38:11,887
(CHUCKLES) What a mess.

831
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:13,218
Right.

832
00:38:14,392 --> 00:38:15,916
She just got her period.

833
00:38:17,695 --> 00:38:21,426
Well, I guess she's not
a little baby anymore.

834
00:38:23,501 --> 00:38:25,401
It would be nice to
see more of each other.

835
00:38:25,569 --> 00:38:29,369
Well, we can
certainly arrange for that.
I'd love to see the girls.

836
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,170
That would be nice.
Mm-hmm. It would.

837
00:38:33,444 --> 00:38:37,847
Do you have a day
that is better...
A good day?

838
00:38:38,115 --> 00:38:40,583
I would say the weekends,
but our weekends are hell.

839
00:38:41,052 --> 00:38:42,679
Soccer competitions,
kids' exams.

840
00:38:42,753 --> 00:38:44,983
Right, right.
I mean, we're both so busy.

841
00:38:45,056 --> 00:38:48,685
I have young children,
you have young children.

842
00:38:48,759 --> 00:38:52,354
I don't think we should
judge ourselves too
harshly about that.

843
00:38:53,631 --> 00:38:56,395
I know, I wasn't...
I didn't say anything.

844
00:38:56,467 --> 00:39:00,597
No, I'm glad we're here.
I think this is a good start.

845
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:04,198
And then, we can spend
more time together,
it'd be nice.

846
00:39:05,409 --> 00:39:06,706
It'd be nice.

847
00:39:10,381 --> 00:39:12,008
Do you want to see
pictures of the kids?

848
00:39:12,283 --> 00:39:13,773
Oh. Yeah.

849
00:39:15,152 --> 00:39:19,145
This is Kel, my son.

850
00:39:20,057 --> 00:39:23,390
He's handsome. He's 13?
Mm-hmm.

851
00:39:23,461 --> 00:39:28,694
And that's Alexandra,
my daughter.
She's a real perfectionist.

852
00:39:29,166 --> 00:39:30,724
A lot like you.

853
00:39:31,068 --> 00:39:34,060
That's the whole gang at Cabo.

854
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:37,670
Excuse me, dear,
I gotta go to the restroom.

855
00:39:38,008 --> 00:39:39,771
Be right back.
Okay.

856
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:16,111
Daddy and I are
making some changes

857
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:18,171
so that we can be
happier and healthier.

858
00:40:18,883 --> 00:40:21,579
And we're starting with
this meal that I prepared.

859
00:40:21,886 --> 00:40:23,911
I think it looks great.
Doesn't it look good?

860
00:40:23,988 --> 00:40:25,148
What is that,
grilled cheeses?

861
00:40:25,623 --> 00:40:27,682
No, baked tofu.
Oh.

862
00:40:27,958 --> 00:40:29,448
It's actually really tasty.

863
00:40:29,527 --> 00:40:31,722
And the lettuce is
so fresh and tasty

864
00:40:31,796 --> 00:40:35,254
that you forget how good
lettuce tastes on its own,

865
00:40:35,332 --> 00:40:36,799
without dressing.

866
00:40:37,034 --> 00:40:40,060
No, dressing always
gets in the way of the
natural taste of the lettuce.

867
00:40:40,304 --> 00:40:42,272
And another
thing we've decided

868
00:40:42,339 --> 00:40:46,969
is to cut back on
all of the electronics we use.

869
00:40:47,912 --> 00:40:51,871
Basically,
what we're going to do,
is get rid of the Wi-Fi

870
00:40:51,982 --> 00:40:53,813
and only use the computer...

871
00:40:53,884 --> 00:40:55,977
What?
...from 8:00
to 8:30 at night.

872
00:40:56,053 --> 00:40:57,384
How are we gonna
go on the computer?

873
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:59,855
We're gonna have
a hard line in the kitchen.

874
00:40:59,924 --> 00:41:01,516
Yeah. We'll supervise that.

875
00:41:01,592 --> 00:41:04,254
You can't do this.
You can't take away
the Wi-Fi.

876
00:41:04,328 --> 00:41:06,728
No Wi-Fi!
A-ha-ha.

877
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:08,526
You don't spend
enough time with the family

878
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:12,501
when you're constantly
on your iPhone
and your computer.

879
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:16,006
And, you know, you're only
here for five more years.

880
00:41:16,073 --> 00:41:17,904
So, you won't see
me after five years?

881
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:20,409
No, but you won't
be living with us.

882
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:22,207
And you should get to
know your little sister.

883

PETE: You've got
the perfect friend,
right here.

884
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:26,215
I don't wanna be
friends with her now.

885
00:41:26,283 --> 00:41:29,548
I'll be friends with her when
she's 20 and a normal person.

886
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:32,350
I don't wanna hang out
with her when I'm in my 20s.

887
00:41:32,423 --> 00:41:33,788
You're on the computer
too much as it is.

888
00:41:33,858 --> 00:41:36,656
You need to get outside more,
do some playing outside.

889
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:40,696
Yeah, you could build things.
You could build
a fort outside.

890
00:41:40,764 --> 00:41:42,994
What?
Yeah, build a fort.

891
00:41:43,067 --> 00:41:44,500
Play with your
friends and have...

892
00:41:44,568 --> 00:41:47,298
Make a fort? Outside?

893
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:48,729
And do what?

894
00:41:48,806 --> 00:41:50,603
Do what in the fort?

895
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:54,838
When I was a kid,
we used to build tree houses
and play with sticks.

896
00:41:55,246 --> 00:41:57,544
Nobody plays with sticks.

897
00:41:58,115 --> 00:41:59,309
You and Charlotte can
have a lemonade stand.

898
00:41:59,583 --> 00:42:00,607
Play kick the can.

899
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:02,151
Look for dead bodies.

900
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:03,786
It's fun. That's fun to do.

901
00:42:04,054 --> 00:42:06,545
Get a tire and then
just take a stick and
run down a street with it.

902
00:42:06,624 --> 00:42:09,320
Nobody does that crap.
It's 2012.

903
00:42:09,393 --> 00:42:10,917
You don't need technology.

904
00:42:10,995 --> 00:42:12,622
No technology!

905
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:13,788
Charlotte, put that down.

906
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:18,096
I don't need to be monitored
all the time on the computer.

907
00:42:18,168 --> 00:42:19,499
I don't do anything bad.

908
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:20,935
Nobody said you were bad.

909
00:42:21,005 --> 00:42:22,563
I don't do things
I'm not supposed to.

910
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,301
I don't illegally
download music.

I don't look at
porn like Wendy.

She is up to no good.
She's not allowed
to come over here anymore.

913
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:30,469
What's porn?

914
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:31,606
No, she said "corn."

915
00:42:31,682 --> 00:42:33,980
This isn't turning out
the way I wanted it to.

916
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:35,143
I'm not hungry.

917
00:42:35,653 --> 00:42:37,416
No computer.
Listen to your mom.

918
00:42:37,655 --> 00:42:38,952
I need to use it
for my homework.

We haven't been to Laguna
without the kids in years.

00:43:01,445 --> 00:43:03,242
Jesus.
And "do my homework."

929
00:43:03,314 --> 00:43:04,508
Them's lil' bitches.

930
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:08,109
Them's lil' bitches.
Bugging us for
shit all the time.

931
00:43:08,185 --> 00:43:10,449
And they never
appreciate anything.

932
00:43:10,521 --> 00:43:13,456
No! God, no.
They're selfish assholes.

934
00:43:14,992 --> 00:43:18,120
Aw, I feel bad.
I love them.

935
00:43:18,195 --> 00:43:19,219
I know.

936
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:21,890
DEBBlE: I miss them already.
Should we go home?

937
00:43:22,366 --> 00:43:23,458
PETE: Nah.

938
00:44:06,076 --> 00:44:07,202
Why do we fight?

939
00:44:07,277 --> 00:44:08,608
I don't know,
it makes no sense.

940
00:44:08,679 --> 00:44:09,941
It makes no sense.

941
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:11,807
When we get in a fight,

942
00:44:11,882 --> 00:44:14,976
Iook at my eyes and let's
remember this moment,
right now,

943
00:44:15,052 --> 00:44:16,610
and know that we
never have to fight.

944
00:44:17,121 --> 00:44:18,816
But you're such
a dick sometimes.

945
00:44:18,889 --> 00:44:20,220
I know, I am a dick sometimes.

946
00:44:20,524 --> 00:44:22,651
People think I'm so nice,
but I'm such a dick.

947
00:44:23,193 --> 00:44:25,093
Thank you for admitting that.

948
00:44:25,295 --> 00:44:27,923
And you get so mad at me,
I feel like you
want to kill me.

949
00:44:28,098 --> 00:44:29,690
I do want to kill you.

950
00:44:29,967 --> 00:44:31,093
How would you do it?

951
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:33,227
I don't know. I'd poison you.

952
00:44:33,637 --> 00:44:37,403
I'd poison your cupcakes
that you pretend
not to eat every day.

953
00:44:37,474 --> 00:44:40,272
And just put enough in
to just slowly weaken you.

954
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:41,368
I love it.

955
00:44:41,445 --> 00:44:43,379
I would enjoy our
last few months together.
Me too.

956
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:46,047
Because you'd be
so weak and sweet.

957
00:44:46,116 --> 00:44:47,947
And I could
take care of you...

958
00:44:48,085 --> 00:44:49,382
But while killing you.

959
00:44:49,553 --> 00:44:51,487
See, you know
what I love about us?

960
00:44:51,555 --> 00:44:53,045
You can still surprise me.

961
00:44:53,123 --> 00:44:56,251
I figured,
for sure, you'd knock me out
with one fell swoop of poison.

962
00:44:56,326 --> 00:44:58,590
But you would extend it
over a series of months.

963
00:44:58,796 --> 00:44:59,990
(LAUGHS)

964
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:01,563
Have you ever
thought about killing me?

965
00:45:01,632 --> 00:45:02,656
Oh, yeah.
Really?

966
00:45:02,733 --> 00:45:03,757
Sure.

967
00:45:03,834 --> 00:45:05,131
How would you do it?
Wood chipper.

968
00:45:05,235 --> 00:45:06,702
A wood chipper?
Yeah.

969
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:07,896
A wood chipper.

970
00:45:07,971 --> 00:45:09,029
Yeah.

971
00:45:09,106 --> 00:45:10,232
Wow.

972
00:45:10,307 --> 00:45:11,638
I know. Did you see Fargo?

973
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:12,733
Yeah.

974
00:45:12,843 --> 00:45:14,003
(WHOOSHES)

975
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:15,470
Ugh.

976
00:45:15,612 --> 00:45:18,547
That's a bad plan.
The cupcakes is
a way better plan.

977
00:45:18,615 --> 00:45:19,809
It is. You're right.

978
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:21,612
You know what?
I won't murder you.

979
00:45:21,752 --> 00:45:22,980
Aw!

980
00:45:23,687 --> 00:45:24,881
I love you.

981
00:45:25,289 --> 00:45:26,483
I love you, too.

982
00:45:27,424 --> 00:45:28,618
Do you know what I brought?
What?

983
00:45:28,759 --> 00:45:31,284
A medical marijuana cookie.
Ben gave it to
me last Christmas.

984
00:45:31,462 --> 00:45:32,520
What?

985
00:45:32,629 --> 00:45:33,618
Yeah. I brought it.
You did?

986
00:45:33,697 --> 00:45:34,721
Chocolate chip kooky.

987
00:45:34,798 --> 00:45:35,787
Should we do it?

988
00:45:35,966 --> 00:45:38,867
Let's eat the cookie
and then we'll order
a bunch of cheeseburgers.

989
00:45:38,936 --> 00:45:40,699
Let's order the entire
room service menu.

990
00:45:40,804 --> 00:45:44,240
Just get all of it.
You deserve it,
you really do.

991
00:45:44,441 --> 00:45:45,931
Wouldn't you
rather have me around

992
00:45:46,043 --> 00:45:49,069
for less years
and I'm incredibly happy,
than longer and miserable?

993
00:45:49,613 --> 00:45:52,081
Yes, and I just
realized that right now.

994
00:45:52,149 --> 00:45:53,343
Go get the cookie.
I'm getting the cookie.

995
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:54,884
Go get the cookie.

996
00:45:55,052 --> 00:45:56,144
Ow!

997
00:45:56,286 --> 00:45:57,878
Should we watch porn
when we eat the cookie?

998
00:45:58,822 --> 00:46:00,483
Yeah. Should we
get a block of porn?

999
00:46:00,657 --> 00:46:02,852
I don't think we
need 24 hours of porn.

1000
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:06,487
But you know, two porns
costs just about as much
as a 24-hour block.

1001
00:46:06,830 --> 00:46:08,195
I think that's
too much porn.

1002
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:11,890
We don't have to watch it all,
but for the value,
it makes sense.

1003
00:46:12,870 --> 00:46:14,064
How much are we
supposed to eat?

1004
00:46:14,138 --> 00:46:16,231
I don't know.
I think six or
seven cookies, right?

1005
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:19,008
Plus, it's old,
it probably has
lost some of its...

1006
00:46:19,176 --> 00:46:20,768
Potency.

1007
00:46:23,013 --> 00:46:25,174
We should have sex more.

1008
00:46:25,315 --> 00:46:27,306
I mean,
girls have it so easy.

1009
00:46:27,384 --> 00:46:30,785
You just show up
with your sexual organs
and you're good to go.

1010
00:46:30,854 --> 00:46:32,082
All the pressure
is on the guy.

1011
00:46:32,156 --> 00:46:33,180
It's true.

1012
00:46:33,257 --> 00:46:36,226
And I look at guys...
Like, I look at a guy
like Prince,

1013
00:46:36,293 --> 00:46:37,624
and you know that guy fucks.

1014
00:46:37,694 --> 00:46:38,752
Yeah.

1015
00:46:38,829 --> 00:46:41,127
I know I don't
fuck like Prince.
Uh-uh.

1016
00:46:41,231 --> 00:46:42,493
Prince can fuck.
Uh-huh.

1017

like Ross from Friends.

Check it out.
It's my dick and balls.

1026
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:15,560
Oh, my God.
I don't eat my own dick.

1027
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:17,463
I ate my dick!

I'm gonna deep
throat this clair.

with you so bad.

00:50:05,469 --> 00:50:07,630
I need you to look
at it, all right?

1086
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:11,934
I think I might have an
anal fissure, or a hemorrhoid,
or a worm or something.

1087
00:50:14,811 --> 00:50:16,335
What are you
doing with your phone?

1088
00:50:16,413 --> 00:50:19,075
I'm trying to take pictures
of it so I can compare it
to something on Google.

1089
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:25,550
Can we just keep
just a small shred of mystery

1090
00:50:25,956 --> 00:50:28,151
in our relationship, please?

1091
00:50:28,358 --> 00:50:30,349
Look, I saw you
have two babies, okay?

1092
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:32,093
Seriously, I need you
to get up all in that.

1093
00:50:32,229 --> 00:50:34,857
I do not want to
investigate your anus.

1094
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:37,026
Payback time.

1095
00:50:38,902 --> 00:50:40,301
(SlGHS)

1096
00:50:45,442 --> 00:50:46,636
It's a hemorrhoid.

1097
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:48,806
Thank you.

1098
00:50:49,112 --> 00:50:51,307
Now, erase that
from your memory.

1099
00:50:56,720 --> 00:51:00,053
Where'd she get those clothes?
Those are expensive clothes.

1100
00:51:00,824 --> 00:51:02,917
Think. Where do you think?

1101
00:51:07,297 --> 00:51:09,629
I don't want
this to sound harsh,

1102
00:51:09,699 --> 00:51:11,633
but everything that comes out
of her mouth is a lie.

1103
00:51:11,768 --> 00:51:14,066
Everything that
goes into it is a dick.

1104
00:51:14,237 --> 00:51:15,966
Everything that
goes in is dicks?

1105
00:51:16,273 --> 00:51:17,365
A dick.

1106
00:51:17,574 --> 00:51:18,666
Don't say that.

1107
00:51:18,975 --> 00:51:22,069
I'm sorry.
I'm just being
protective of the store.

1108
00:51:22,446 --> 00:51:24,209
I'm going to go
talk to her.

1109
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:31,112
Hey, Desi.

1110
00:51:31,288 --> 00:51:32,448
Hi.
Hi.

1111
00:51:32,823 --> 00:51:34,586
Is that your new
Acura out front?

1112
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:36,085
Uh, yeah.

1113
00:51:36,193 --> 00:51:37,319
It's so nice.

1114
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:38,553
Do you love it?

1115
00:51:38,728 --> 00:51:41,754
I mean, it's not a fucking
Porsche, but it'll do for now.

1116
00:51:42,399 --> 00:51:43,491
Huh.

1117
00:51:44,034 --> 00:51:45,365
Hey, Desi,
would you mind wearing

1118
00:51:45,435 --> 00:51:47,164
some of the clothes that
we have in the store?

1119
00:51:47,337 --> 00:51:49,305
Yes. Yeah, I'm sorry.

1120
00:51:49,639 --> 00:51:50,867
Will that be okay?
Yeah.

1121
00:51:53,577 --> 00:51:54,635
Perfect.

1122
00:51:54,711 --> 00:51:56,110
Good?

1123
00:51:57,380 --> 00:51:59,405
You know, I actually
made this one myself.

1124
00:51:59,649 --> 00:52:00,775
Did you?
Yeah.

1125
00:52:01,351 --> 00:52:04,047
The tiger, I did it on a piece
of paper separately,

1126
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:06,988
and then I actually
transferred it to the T-shirt.

1127
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:08,182
Wow.

1128
00:52:08,492 --> 00:52:11,427
So, you stenciled
on the tiger?

1129
00:52:11,595 --> 00:52:13,426
I drew it on
a piece of paper and then

1130
00:52:13,530 --> 00:52:16,055
I transferred
the drawing to the T-shirt.

1131
00:52:16,666 --> 00:52:18,566
You have an amazing body.

1132
00:52:18,735 --> 00:52:19,827
Really?

1133
00:52:19,903 --> 00:52:22,371
Yes. Are those real?

1134
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:24,798
My boobs?
Yeah.

1135
00:52:25,275 --> 00:52:27,368
Yeah. Do you wanna
touch them?

1136
00:52:27,577 --> 00:52:28,669
Really?

1137
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:30,109
Touch them.

1138
00:52:30,247 --> 00:52:31,373
Okay.

1139
00:52:35,185 --> 00:52:36,550
Wow.

1140
00:52:37,187 --> 00:52:38,176
Huh.

1141
00:52:38,788 --> 00:52:39,914
Jesus.

1142
00:52:41,324 --> 00:52:45,658
I mean,
they really are amazing.
That's firm, for real.

1143
00:52:46,496 --> 00:52:48,828
They're like
a memory mattress.

1144
00:52:49,366 --> 00:52:52,631
It's, wow, like
Tempur-Pedic, you know?

1145
00:52:53,036 --> 00:52:54,731
They look amazing.

1146
00:52:55,071 --> 00:52:57,369
My kids just sucked
the meat right out of mine.

1147
00:52:57,674 --> 00:52:58,868
No.
Yeah.

1148
00:52:58,942 --> 00:53:00,000
There's some meat in there.

1149
00:53:00,143 --> 00:53:04,079
My boobs are just gone.
Since I had kids,
my boobs are just gone.

1150
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:06,945
They didn't even
say goodbye, you know?
They just left.

1151
00:53:07,317 --> 00:53:10,684
By the time I'm 40,
these are gonna
go National Geographic on me.

1152
00:53:11,421 --> 00:53:13,889
I feel bad about
myself right now.

1153
00:53:15,458 --> 00:53:17,983
REALTOR: I think this is
a really good offer
on the house.

1154
00:53:18,128 --> 00:53:19,720
We expected more.

1155
00:53:19,796 --> 00:53:21,286
I know it's a bad market,

1156
00:53:21,364 --> 00:53:23,457
but that's still way under
what we were looking for.

1157
00:53:23,533 --> 00:53:27,128
I know, but based on what
the market's like, it's like
you're gaining money,

1158
00:53:27,204 --> 00:53:28,762
because it's so much
more than what you deserve.

1159
00:53:29,806 --> 00:53:30,932
But these people are from Iran

1160
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:33,407
and they don't really know
that they're offering
too much.

1161
00:53:33,476 --> 00:53:36,138
Is there any chance
that Debbie will go for it?

1162
00:53:36,346 --> 00:53:38,075
I doubt it.
I mean, I don't know.

1163
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:40,012
There's a lot of
inventory out there.

1164
00:53:40,150 --> 00:53:41,947
I mean, what is her problem?

1165
00:53:42,118 --> 00:53:44,882
She has
unrealistic expectations.

1166
00:53:46,122 --> 00:53:47,714
I'm faster than you!

1167
00:53:47,857 --> 00:53:49,347
We're Jewish!

1168
00:53:49,659 --> 00:53:52,890
Hey! Did you miss me, Travis?

1169
00:53:53,363 --> 00:53:55,194
It's Jack.

1170
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:56,926
Hey, Jack.

1171
00:53:57,234 --> 00:53:58,462
JACK: My daddy
doesn't know my name!
(CHUCKLES)

1172
00:53:58,602 --> 00:53:59,864
LARRY: Okay, come on,
let's go.

1173
00:53:59,936 --> 00:54:02,996
Can I go show them my
crystals before they leave?

1174
00:54:03,106 --> 00:54:04,198
DEBBlE: Yeah, really quick.

1175
00:54:04,341 --> 00:54:06,502
It's all right with me.
Elevator down!

1176
00:54:06,743 --> 00:54:09,837
Okay. Go play with
your tiny uncles.

1177
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:11,710
JACK: Let's play murder!
TRAVlS: Yeah. Let's go.

1178
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:13,576
So, what are you doing?
Spring cleaning?

1179
00:54:13,683 --> 00:54:18,347
I'm getting rid of
everything in the house
that has gluten or sugar.

1180
00:54:18,655 --> 00:54:20,145
Why? What's wrong
with gluten?

1181
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:21,588
Gluten's really bad for you.

1182
00:54:21,992 --> 00:54:23,289
I don't think so.
It's wheat.

1183
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:24,620
Don't you watch Dr. Oz?

1184
00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:26,054
As in, "The Wizard of"?

1185
00:54:26,596 --> 00:54:29,690
Hey, Mom, we were wondering
if we can use
the computer to iChat?

1186
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:32,091
Remember the rules?
8:00 to 8:30.

1187
00:54:32,369 --> 00:54:33,859
Yeah, but I have
a friend over.

1188
00:54:34,471 --> 00:54:35,961
Hi, Wendy. Yeah, I know.

1189
00:54:36,973 --> 00:54:39,339
Why don't you guys go play?
You could go build a fort!

1190
00:54:39,476 --> 00:54:40,807
LARRY:
Hey, remember the Alamo?

1191
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:42,411
Have you ever
built a fort, Wendy?

1192
00:54:42,545 --> 00:54:43,705
Like, on Facebook?

1193
00:54:44,214 --> 00:54:46,307
I will take this
if you're gonna
throw it away,

1194
00:54:46,416 --> 00:54:48,714
because at our house,
we're wheat-eaters.

1195
00:54:49,552 --> 00:54:52,020
But don't you want
to live long enough
to see your kids grow up?

1196
00:54:52,455 --> 00:54:53,888
That's up to God, honey.

1197
00:54:54,057 --> 00:54:56,082
No, but that's really
not good for the kids.

1198
00:54:56,359 --> 00:54:58,327
Eh, the kids eat grass,
this is fine.

1199
00:54:58,662 --> 00:55:01,290
Wendy's mom lets her go on
whenever she wants.

1200
00:55:01,464 --> 00:55:02,988
Yeah, my mom's
pretty cool about it

1201
00:55:03,099 --> 00:55:04,828
as long as
I finish my homework.

1202
00:55:05,168 --> 00:55:06,328
Yeah.

1203
00:55:06,569 --> 00:55:08,332
Well, I guess
I'm not the cool one,

1204
00:55:08,405 --> 00:55:10,839
but the rules are just
different in our house.

1205
00:55:11,341 --> 00:55:13,332
Well, I get better
grades than Wendy.

1206
00:55:13,510 --> 00:55:15,478
She does. She's so smart.

1207
00:55:15,912 --> 00:55:17,311
Let me just grab
the candy worms.

1208
00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:18,911
See, your rules
are ridiculous.

1209
00:55:19,215 --> 00:55:20,273
Don't sass me.

1210
00:55:20,617 --> 00:55:23,586
I'm only sassing you
because you're throwing out
all the food in our house

1211
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:25,280
and I'm freaking starving.

1212
00:55:25,388 --> 00:55:26,480
You're being stupid.

1213
00:55:26,656 --> 00:55:28,385
Wendy, could you go stand
in the other room, please?

1214
00:55:28,658 --> 00:55:29,784
Yeah.
Mom.

1215
00:55:29,959 --> 00:55:31,051
Give me your iPhone, now.

1216
00:55:31,261 --> 00:55:32,558
The nougat things are good.

1217
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:34,592
I have all my
contacts in there.

1218
00:55:34,764 --> 00:55:36,493
Okay, if you don't give me
your phone right now,

1219
00:55:36,566 --> 00:55:38,864
then I'm gonna
have to take away
your phone and your computer.

1220
00:55:39,035 --> 00:55:41,162
Jesus Christ, I need
my computer to do homework.

1221
00:55:41,237 --> 00:55:42,932
That's it.
No phone, no computer.

1222
00:55:43,106 --> 00:55:44,130
This is B.S.

1223
00:55:44,307 --> 00:55:46,969
This is a bunch of F-ing S.
You're acting like a B.

1224
00:55:47,310 --> 00:55:49,039
Kids! Time to go!

1225
00:55:49,279 --> 00:55:50,940
You go to your room,
right now.

1226
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:52,478
You are not allowed to use

1227
00:55:52,816 --> 00:55:57,219
iPhone, iPad,
iPod Touch, iTunes, Netflix,

1228
00:55:57,454 --> 00:55:59,285
Pandora, or Spotify.

1229
00:55:59,656 --> 00:56:02,523
She's a little pip,
just like her mommy.

1230
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:06,558
So, I might have
a job tomorrow.

1231
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:09,832
At least, I'm gonna go
try to give an estimate.

1232
00:56:09,899 --> 00:56:11,560
Do you mind taking the kids
for a couple of hours?

1233
00:56:12,435 --> 00:56:13,629
Um...

1234
00:56:13,770 --> 00:56:14,794
Okay.

1235
00:56:16,072 --> 00:56:17,437
This is nice.

1236
00:56:17,707 --> 00:56:19,800
You and I don't spend
enough time together, do we?

1237
00:56:20,443 --> 00:56:21,876
We spend enough time together.

What else did they say?

1243
00:56:33,990 --> 00:56:35,617
All right,
some kid named Joseph...

1244
00:56:35,725 --> 00:56:37,386
I know Joseph.
You do?

1245
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:39,187
He's making
a "hot-or-not" list.

1246
00:56:39,596 --> 00:56:40,688
What?

1247
00:56:40,764 --> 00:56:43,130
Sadie said, "That's so lame
and immature that
you're doing that."

1248
00:56:43,199 --> 00:56:47,067
And then Joseph says,
"Yo, girl,
we're just having some fun.

1249
00:56:47,203 --> 00:56:48,795
"So don't be a bitch, yo."

1250
00:56:49,606 --> 00:56:51,267
That is not nice.

1251
00:56:51,608 --> 00:56:53,508
So then Sadie said,
"Don't call me a bitch."

1252
00:56:53,576 --> 00:56:55,100
And Joseph said,
"l didn't call you a bitch.

1253
00:56:55,178 --> 00:56:56,770
"l said don't
act like a bitch.

1254
00:56:56,846 --> 00:56:58,905

you're in
the 'Not-Hot' column."

the judge of "hot"?

could do to her self-esteem?

1259
00:57:08,658 --> 00:57:10,455
"l gotta go,

And then,
for some reason,

1262
00:57:15,131 --> 00:57:18,225
there's an emoticon
of a panda doing push-ups.

1263
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:20,869
I wonder what that means.

1264
00:57:21,504 --> 00:57:23,904
I don't think it
means anything.
I think it's just adorable.

01:03:08,184 --> 01:03:09,617
What a relief.

1391
01:03:10,019 --> 01:03:12,817
Because I can finally
relax now, you know?

1392
01:03:13,322 --> 01:03:14,983
It's been, like...

1393
01:03:16,492 --> 01:03:17,857
(SlGHS)

1394
01:03:21,531 --> 01:03:23,021
It's okay.

1395
01:03:24,333 --> 01:03:26,096
I'm so happy,
though, you know?

1396
01:03:26,169 --> 01:03:28,569
I really am,
because, I mean...

1397
01:03:29,105 --> 01:03:30,265
It's good.

1398
01:03:31,107 --> 01:03:33,439
Great. Great.

1399
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:35,038
(SlGHS DEEPLY)

1400
01:04:24,193 --> 01:04:25,751
Hey.
Hey.

1401
01:04:26,295 --> 01:04:28,456
Why are you in a bathrobe?
It's the middle
of the afternoon.

1402
01:04:28,531 --> 01:04:31,864
I took a late shower.
Why are you busting my balls?

1403
01:04:32,068 --> 01:04:34,127
I'm sorry about the record.

1404
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:37,739
You're going
through financial shit.
This is what I live with.

1405
01:04:37,940 --> 01:04:40,738
This is a horrible
time in human history.
What is that?

1406
01:04:41,010 --> 01:04:44,036
It's something that might
help both of our situations.

1407
01:04:44,247 --> 01:04:47,580
This is
a drawing by John Lennon.

1408
01:04:48,017 --> 01:04:50,144
I got it 10 years ago
for $5,000.

1409
01:04:50,353 --> 01:04:51,615
I don't know how
much it's worth now.

1410
01:04:51,687 --> 01:04:52,881
It could be five,
it could be 20.

1411
01:04:53,956 --> 01:04:55,685
I don't want this.

1412
01:04:55,958 --> 01:04:57,892
I don't even like it.
I'm not gonna hang it up.

1413
01:04:58,094 --> 01:05:00,688
It's not for you to hang up.
It's for you to sell.

1414
01:05:00,763 --> 01:05:02,890
That way, I can give it to you
and you make some money,

1415
01:05:02,965 --> 01:05:04,489
and Debbie won't know
that I'm giving you anything.

1416
01:05:04,734 --> 01:05:07,669
You're not giving me money.
You're giving me a project.

1417
01:05:07,904 --> 01:05:10,429
I don't know how to sell this.
I'm not an art dealer.

1418
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:13,131
(STAMMERS) I don't know.
Sell it online.

1419
01:05:13,342 --> 01:05:15,708
You know, do some research,
make some calls.

1420
01:05:15,978 --> 01:05:18,344
Or is that too hard to do
with your high blood pressure?

1421
01:05:18,481 --> 01:05:20,449
All right.
Don't get snippy.

1422
01:05:21,384 --> 01:05:24,217
Just because you
write a great song
doesn't mean you can draw.

1423
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:27,014
It's incredible.
John Lennon drew it.

1424
01:05:27,456 --> 01:05:28,753
I think it's a Ringo.

1425
01:05:29,258 --> 01:05:31,385
Don't beat me up if
I get $300 for it.

1426
01:05:31,661 --> 01:05:34,027
Don't take anything
less than $6,500 for that.

1427
01:05:34,263 --> 01:05:36,254
It's very valuable.
It's important to me.

1428
01:05:36,365 --> 01:05:37,923
I want you to sell
it so I can help you.

1429
01:05:38,134 --> 01:05:39,396
Okay.

1430
01:05:39,568 --> 01:05:41,627
All right.
I'll see you at my party.

1431
01:05:41,737 --> 01:05:44,069
What should I bring?
You want wine or something?

1432
01:05:44,373 --> 01:05:47,672
No, don't buy wine
with my money
and give it to me at my party.

1433
01:05:47,877 --> 01:05:48,901
That's mean.

1434
01:05:49,011 --> 01:05:50,603
I love you. Bye.
All right.

1435
01:05:51,147 --> 01:05:53,047
How do I call eBay?

1436
01:05:54,383 --> 01:05:57,978
I mean, he called me a bitch.
What am I supposed to say?

1437
01:06:00,523 --> 01:06:02,514
But I think maybe that
might mean he likes me.

1438
01:06:02,591 --> 01:06:05,992
I don't know.
It's making me really...
It's really awkward.

1439
01:06:06,929 --> 01:06:08,419
I think he might like you.

1440
01:06:10,866 --> 01:06:13,562
She's so cute.
She's so tall.

1441
01:06:13,869 --> 01:06:14,995
I know.

1442
01:06:15,137 --> 01:06:16,161
How did that happen?

1443
01:06:19,075 --> 01:06:21,168
Do you ever wish we
had a bigger family?

1444
01:06:21,444 --> 01:06:23,309
(CLlCKS TONGUE) No.
Never for a second.

1445
01:06:25,281 --> 01:06:26,373
Never.

1446
01:06:26,515 --> 01:06:28,005
Never?
Never.

1447
01:06:28,484 --> 01:06:29,678
I love what we have.

1448
01:06:29,986 --> 01:06:31,283
One? A breeze.

1449
01:06:31,554 --> 01:06:32,987
Two? Brutal.

1450
01:06:33,422 --> 01:06:35,686
Three?
Put a bullet in my head.

1451
01:06:35,925 --> 01:06:36,914
Ugh.

1452
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:40,557
You know, I think about that
gray-haired pregnant lady
from school,

1453
01:06:40,663 --> 01:06:42,563
and I just feel bad for her.

1454
01:06:42,665 --> 01:06:44,758
And I feel bad
for the kid.

1455
01:06:45,101 --> 01:06:46,466
Can you imagine?

1456
01:06:46,569 --> 01:06:48,730
All the other little kids,
"Where's your mommy?"

1457
01:06:48,804 --> 01:06:52,706
"Oh, she's the one
sitting in that scooter,
eating a soft cracker."

1458
01:06:53,209 --> 01:06:55,609
Kids don't want to
have old parents.

1459
01:06:55,878 --> 01:06:58,642
You know what?
It would also be nice for
us to spend some time apart.

1460
01:06:59,048 --> 01:07:01,846
Kind of rediscover who
we are, individually.

1461
01:07:02,084 --> 01:07:04,644
It'd be so great to not
see you for a chunk of time,

1462
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:06,312
so that I could
really just miss you.

1463
01:07:07,256 --> 01:07:10,089
Remember when we
used to miss each other?

1464
01:07:20,669 --> 01:07:22,261
Hey! Hey, you.

1465
01:07:22,805 --> 01:07:23,897
Yeah, what's up?

1466
01:07:24,206 --> 01:07:25,468
Hey, I'm Sadie's mom.

1467
01:07:26,909 --> 01:07:28,035
Sadie?

1468
01:07:28,144 --> 01:07:30,044
Sadie, the one you
chat with on the lnternet.

1469
01:07:30,346 --> 01:07:31,404
No, man. That ain't me.

1470
01:07:31,514 --> 01:07:33,243
Well, it was you.
I saw your picture.

1471
01:07:33,416 --> 01:07:37,546
Did you make a hot list?
And not put Sadie
on the hot list?

1472
01:07:37,820 --> 01:07:39,082
She was not on my list, no.

1473
01:07:39,355 --> 01:07:40,583
You know
what I'm gonna do?

1474
01:07:40,656 --> 01:07:41,884
I'm gonna make
my own hot list.

1475
01:07:41,957 --> 01:07:44,983
And you know what?
You're on the not-hot list.

1476
01:07:45,227 --> 01:07:46,353
How does that feel?

1477
01:07:46,762 --> 01:07:48,923
It doesn't bother me.
I'm comfortable
with the way I am.

1478
01:07:49,098 --> 01:07:51,293
Maybe you shouldn't be
so comfortable with yourself.

1479
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:52,965
You know why?

1480
01:07:53,135 --> 01:07:55,501
You look like
a miniature Tom Petty.

1481
01:07:55,838 --> 01:07:57,169
How's that feel?

1482
01:07:57,273 --> 01:07:59,104
You think that
haircut's cool? It's not.

1483
01:07:59,375 --> 01:08:02,003
It looks like you
put your Justin
Bieber wig on backwards.

1484
01:08:02,378 --> 01:08:04,107
Are you still
comfortable with yourself?

1485
01:08:04,447 --> 01:08:06,278
Why are you wearing
a tank top? Huh?

1486
01:08:06,449 --> 01:08:10,351
So you can show off
your little bald pits,
you little hairless wonder?

1487
01:08:10,619 --> 01:08:12,917
Cool tank top,
man. Huh?

1488
01:08:14,123 --> 01:08:17,923
So next time you think about
writing something nasty

1489
01:08:18,027 --> 01:08:21,121
on my daughter's
Facebook page,
just remember me.

1490
01:08:21,297 --> 01:08:22,355
Remember me.

1491
01:08:23,099 --> 01:08:26,660
I will come down here,
and I will fuck you up.

1492
01:08:26,869 --> 01:08:28,029
(SOBS) Okay, I'm sorry.

1493
01:08:28,137 --> 01:08:30,002
Wait a minute.
Hey, hey, hey!

1494
01:08:30,706 --> 01:08:32,139
Wait. You're not...
Are you crying?

1495
01:08:32,308 --> 01:08:33,366
Just let me go.

1496
01:08:33,576 --> 01:08:34,770
Oh, my...

1497
01:08:36,045 --> 01:08:37,569
I'm sorry.
Okay.

1498
01:08:38,114 --> 01:08:39,240
I'm sorry.

1499
01:08:39,515 --> 01:08:41,642
I'm not in my right head.

1500
01:08:41,717 --> 01:08:44,208
I understand.
My mom's going
through menopause, too.

1501
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:45,344
It's a hard time.
