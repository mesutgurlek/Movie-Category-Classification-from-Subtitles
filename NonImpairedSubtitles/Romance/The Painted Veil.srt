THE PAINTED VEIL

00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:12,715
CHINA 1925

3
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,832
LONDON TWO YEARS EARLIER

4
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,469
Hello.

5
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,228
Say, I was wondering...

6
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:06,870
What?

7
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,475
Sorry. I was wondering if
you'd like to dance?

8
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,550
Why not?

9
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:27,474
Kitty, who was the young man you were
dancing with last night?

10
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,709
Which one?

11
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,390
The quiet, serious-looking one.

12
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,629
Oh, him.

13
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,557
I suppose you invited him, Mother.

14
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,674
I don't know who you're talking about.

15
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,069
I invited him.

16
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,311
His name is Fane and he's a doctor.

17
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,151
He manages a government laboratory
in Shanghai.

18
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,469
A civil servant?

19
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,876
In any case.

20
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,913
He called 'round last Sunday,
we had a long chat.

21
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,558
I told him to come back anytime.

22
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,155
It's not often that you like
any of my young men.

23
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,875
Well, do you like him?

24
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,230
Not really.

25
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,629
- What's wrong with him?
- Is he in love with you?

26
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,915
I don't know.

27
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,911
I should have thought by now
you'd know when a

28
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,399
young man was in love with you.

29
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,869
The point is whether or not I'm in love
with him. And I'm not.

30
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,549
You'd better be careful, young lady.

31
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,551
Time can run out, you know.

32
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,478
Oh, stop it, Mother. Honestly.

33
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,238
The very idea that a woman
should marry

34
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,639
any Tom, Dick, or Harry...

35
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,790
...regardless of her own feelings is
simply prehistoric.

36
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,073
How much longer do you expect your
father to go on supporting you?

37
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,069
Oh.

38
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,071
Hello.

39
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,479
Hello. I...

40
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,229
I was just coming...

41
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,999
Your father invited me.

42
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,630
I'm going out.

43
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,549
May I join you?

44
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,274
Right on time.

45
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,231
What is it exactly that you do?

46
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,993
I'm a bacteriologist.

47
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,469
That must be fascinating.

48
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,479
You have no idea what that is, do you?

49
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,913
No. I'm afraid not.

50
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,559
No, there's no reason you should.

51
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,070
I study the microorganisms
that carry disease.

52
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,671
Charming.

53
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,390
No, it's not actually. It's the opposite.

54
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:04,995
Shall we step inside?

55
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,150
Do you like flowers?

56
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,992
Not particularly, no.

57
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,989
Well, I mean, yes.

58
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,231
But we don't really have
them around the house.

59
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:32,478
Mother says,

60
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,074
"Why purchase something you can
grow for free?"

61
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,638
But then we don't really grow them
either.

62
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,718
It does seem silly, really.

63
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,560
To put all that effort into something
that's just going to die.

64
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,479
I'd like to say something to you.

65
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,151
I came to see you to ask you
if you'll marry me.

66
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,511
You could knock me down
with a feather.

67
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,151
Could you not tell that I'm in love
with you?

68
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,148
You never showed it.

69
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,799
Oh, I'd...

70
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,917
Well, I wanted to. It's difficult. I...

71
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,548
But there it is.

72
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:11,716
Right.

73
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,672
I'm not sure that's very well put.

74
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:15,910
No, it's not.

75
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,638
Do you see how clumsy I am? I...

76
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,229
I'm terrible at these sorts of things.

77
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,150
But the thing is

78
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,798
I've got to get back to China very soon.

79
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,868
I don't have time to be cautious.

80
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,877
I've never thought of you in that way.

81
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,558
I think I improve greatly
upon acquaintance.

82
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,629
Oh, I'm sure you do...

83
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,792
I'd do anything in my power to
make you happy.

84
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,630
Anything at all.

85
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,629
I think you'd like Shanghai.

86
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,798
It's quite exciting, it is.

87
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,069
Lots of dancing.

88
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,997
Surely you're not expecting me to
answer this second?

89
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,552
I don't know you at all.

90
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,472
Yes! Well,
we had the highest of hopes, but...

91
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,236
...no expectation that he'd ask her
so soon.

92
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,475
Yes. A lovely late autumn wedding.

93
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,992
She's done very well for her herself,
has my Doris.

94
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,559
At least one of them's made a success.

95
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,480
No, I gave up on Kitty ages ago.

96
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,557
Yes.

97
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,071
Yes.

98
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:29,235
Well, I know you understand. Yes.

99
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:12,876
Well?

100
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,717
Is it smaller than you imagined?

101
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,878
I'm not sure what I imagined.

102
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,675
Don't you have a piano?

103
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,310
No, I don't play the piano.

104
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,389
Who is it?

105
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,629
It's I.

106
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:44,796
Come in.

107
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,319
Just wanted to see

108
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,708
So, then, you're comfortable, then?

109
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,479
Do you need anything?

110
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:04,990
No.

111
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,550
I'm fine.

112
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,471
Thank you.

113
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,631
Good. Good.

114
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,551
I'm so happy you're here.

115
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,869
Shall I shut the lamp?

116
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,310
What for?

117
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,559
I'll shut the lamp.

118
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,992
It's raining cats and dogs.

119
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,550
I said, it's raining cats and dogs.

120
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,629
Yes, I heard you.

121
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,479
You might have answered.

122
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:49,670
I'm sorry.

123
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,390
I've gotten used to not speaking...

124
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,879
...unless I have something to say.

125
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,913
If nobody spoke unless
they had something to say...

126
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,914
...the human race would soon
lose the power of speech.

127
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,716
Walter.

128
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:13,796
I'm sorry.

129
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,637
You're right.

130
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,552
What shall we do? Shall we...

131
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,153
...shall we play a game?

132
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,635
You don't like the games I play.
They bore you.

133
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,550
Nonsense.

134
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,710
Let's play cards.

135
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,150
Do you think you'd enjoy a night out?

136
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,549
We have an invitation for
Saturday night.

137
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,390
From whom?

138
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,869
The Townsends.

139
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,148
Dorothy Townsend.

140
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,993
Do you not like her?

141
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,879
Well, I've only met her once,

142
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,151
but there's no reason for her
to put on such airs.

143
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:00,877
Does she?

144
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,071
Yes. I have no idea why.

145
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,710
She was what?
Married to a vice consul?

146
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,879
Honestly, they're absurd,
this Shanghai set.

147
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,070
Mother wouldn't dream of asking
half of them to dinner.

148
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,318
I'm taking that black five.

149
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,718
Well, it's all right.

150
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,559
I thought you might enjoy it,

151
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,313
but we certainly don't have to go.

152
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,914
I don't care either way.

153
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,555
Go where?

154
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,879
- Kitty Fane?
- Hello, Dorothy.

155
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,069
I'm so glad you could come.

156
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,675
This is Walter.

157
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:48,995
I'm pleased to meet you.

158
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:49,991
This is my husband.

159
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,636
Charlie, stop talking and
greet our guests.

160
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,149
- You know Mr. Fane.
- Charlie.

161
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,872
It's Dr. Fane, darling.

162
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,310
Oh, dear. I do beg your pardon,
Dr. Fane.

163
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,310
Not at all.

164
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,232
And this is Dr. Fane's wife, Kitty.

165
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,550
Mrs. Fane.

166
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:04,670
Mr. Townsend.

167
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,552
I do apologize, Dr. Fane.

168
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,312
I assumed you worked with Charlie
at the consulate.

169
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,714
Oh, no. Nothing so glamorous.

170
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,074
I'm at the Civil Laboratory.

171
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,240
The government lab? How fascinating.

172
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,789
Are you enjoying it?

173
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,993
I've never seen anything like it.

174
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,392
Every gesture has a meaning.

175
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,878
See how she covers her face
with the cloth?

176
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,391
She is mourning her misfortune.

177
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,479
What happened to her?

178
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,916
She was sold into slavery.

179
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,072
Condemned to a life of drudgery
and despair...

180
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,230
...in a strange land far from home.

181
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:18,910
See the chains?

182
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,153
They represent the heavy bondage
of her poor trapped soul...

183
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,912
...from which there is no escape.

184
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,153
And so she weeps.

185
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,673
She weeps for the lively,

186
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,791
vivacious girl she once was...

187
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,631
...for the lonely woman she has become.

188
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,079
And most of all...

189
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,560
...she weeps for the love
she'll never feel...

190
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,868
...for the love she'll never give.

191
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,673
Is that really what she's saying?

192
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,150
Actually, I haven't a clue what
she's on about.

193
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,788
I don't speak Chinese.

194
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,676
What was that?

195
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,993
Perhaps it was the amah,
or one of the...

196
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:46,796
They've gone.

197
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:52,875
He heard us.

198
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:53,797
Who?

199
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,469
Walter.

200
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,991
Walter. What if it was?

201
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,718
For all he knows you were taking a nap.

202
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,789
With my doors locked?

203
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,799
Kitty, dear, you need a drink.

204
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,550
Even if it was,
my impression is he'll do nothing.

205
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,879
That's flattering.

206
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:16,995
He knows as well as anyone...

207
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,798
...there's nothing to be gained by
making a scandal.

208
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:23,151
Has it occurred to you that my husband
is in love with me?

209
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,994
I have a feeling you're about to say
something awful.

210
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,554
It's just that women are often under
the impression that...

211
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,234
...men are much more in love with them
than they really are.

212
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,552
I wouldn't delude myself for a second
that you were in love with me.

213
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,995
Now there you're wrong.

214
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,309
Do you like your present?

215
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,629
It's good enough.

216
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,869
Charlie?

217
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:22,393
Do I make you as happy as
you make me?

218
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,472
Of course you do, darling.

219
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,474
(Miss you Father)

220
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,073
- Hassan?
- Yes?

221
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,798
- Who brought this package 'round?
- Dr. Fane.

222
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,230
When?

223
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,913
While you sleeping.

224
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,073
It's nearly midday.

225
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,477
We could stop up here under the trees...

226
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,912
...but I'd like to press on if
it's all right with you.

227
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,797
Certainly, my comfort's of no concern
to you.

228
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,879
Right. Then we'll continue.

229
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,073
Charlie Townsend, please.

230
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,150
Charles Townsend.

231
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:41,790
I need to see you.

232
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,709
Kitty, I can't possibly see you.

233
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,552
I've got a meeting in an hour at the club.

234
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,150
What is it?

235
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:48,910
I have to go.

236
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,556
What are you doing home?

237
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,788
I'm sorry. There's something I need
to speak with you about.

238
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,677
Actually, I was just about to
take my bath.

239
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,231
I'm afraid it's rather important, darling.
Can't wait.

240
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,471
Sit down.

241
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,673
Do you know a place called
Mei-Tan-Fu?

242
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,230
No.

243
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,474
Well, it was in the papers the other day.

244
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,391
It's a small town on a tributary
of the Yangtze River,

245
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,230
in the interior.

246
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,632
They've had an outbreak of
cholera there.

247
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,310
It's the worst epidemic anyone's seen
in a long time.

248
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,798
The Chinese medical officer has died.

249
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:46,472
There's a convent of French nuns and
they're trying to run the hospital...

250
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,390
...and they're doing the best
that they can,

251
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,799
but people are dropping like flies.

252
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:54,156
I have volunteered to go and
to take charge.

253
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,229
Why?

254
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,390
Because they need a doctor.

255
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,711
But you're not a doctor.
You're a bacteriologist.

256
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,070
I'm an M.D.

257
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,238
The fact that I'm foremost a scientist...

258
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,912
...is actually all to the good in this case.

259
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,992
Won't it be awfully dangerous?

260
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,870
I suppose it might, yes.

261
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,790
Now, Mei-Tan-Fu is a ten-day journey.

262
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,312
You can go by rail for the first part of it,
but after that it's carriage...

263
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,879
...and then we'll have to take a
sedan chair.

264
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,874
Who's we?

265
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,549
Why, you and I, of course.

266
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,791
You're not expecting me to come too?

267
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:32,070
I hoped that if I was going
you would want to go.

268
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,878
Surely it's no place for a woman.

269
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,639
It would be madness for me to go.
Why should I?

270
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,233
To cheer and comfort me?

271
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,630
No.

272
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,868
No, I won't go.

273
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,877
In fact, it's monstrous of you
to even ask me.

274
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,639
Fine. Then I shall file my petition
for divorce tomorrow.

275
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,869
I'm afraid that you have thought me
a bigger fool than I am.

276
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,719
I don't know what you're talking about.

277
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,149
Don't you?

278
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,672
I am divorcing you for adultery.

279
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:11,231
I am naming Charles Townsend
as your lover.

280
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,788
I'm sorry, Walter.

281
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,310
I realize this is very unpleasant, but,

282
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,470
please, let's not make this uglier
than it needs to be.

283
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:32,313
By all means. What is it that you
propose that we should do?

284
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:37,310
You could let me divorce you quietly.

285
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,395
You divorce me?

286
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:42,473
- On what grounds, may I ask?
- That's what a gentleman would do.

287
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,231
Can you give me one reason I should...

288
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,914
...put myself to the smallest
inconvenience on your account?

289
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,797
Please, Walter, don't be so hateful.

290
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:51,399
We didn't mean to hurt anyone. But...

291
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,072
...Charlie and I have fallen in love.

292
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,469
He wants to marry me.

293
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:58,796
Really?

294
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,231
I knew that you weren't the cleverest girl
in the world...

295
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,552
...but I didn't know that you were
actually a fool.

296
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:06,234
Yes. Well, if it makes you feel better
to hurt me,

297
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,230
then go ahead.

298
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,674
But you might as well get used to it.

299
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,230
We love each other.

300
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,399
And we're sick to death of the secrecy...

301
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,799
...and compromise and all the rest of it.

302
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,717
And now you curse the day
that you ever met me.

303
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,233
Stop mocking me.

304
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,150
There's no other response...

305
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,468
...for such pathetic behavior!

306
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:21,670
It's comic.

307
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,709
When I think about how hard I've tried
to make you happy.

308
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,071
Debasing myself!

309
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,310
Acting as though I was as thrilled
as you...

310
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,719
...by the latest gossip
and as vulgar and as ignorant...

311
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,711
- ...of the world as you are!
- Shut up!

312
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:35,913
If you interrupt me again,
I'll strangle you.

313
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,671
Sit down.

314
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,710
I knew when I married you that

315
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,119
you were selfish and spoiled.

316
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:45,989
But I loved you.

317
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:48,910
I knew that you married me...

318
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,389
...only to get as far away from
your mother as possible...

319
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,719
...and I hoped that one day...

320
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,153
...there'd be something more.

321
00:27:58,720 --> 00:27:59,550
I was wrong.

322
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,629
You don't have it in you.

323
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,553
If a man hasn't what's necessary
to make a woman love him,

324
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,550
then it's his fault...

325
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,070
...not hers.

326
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:10,910
Either way.

327
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,870
Tomorrow morning we are to leave for
Mei-Tan-Fu,

328
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,069
or I shall file my petition.

329
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,912
Walter, you can't be serious about
taking me...

330
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,672
...into the middle of a cholera epidemic.

331
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,069
Do you think that I'm not?

332
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,229
My God.

333
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,878
That's what you want, isn't it?

334
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:34,070
Do you really think Charlie
will let you do this?

335
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,798
I don't think Charlie has very much
to say about it.

336
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,153
Everything you said is true.

337
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,074
Everything.

338
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,391
I married you even though
I didn't love you.

339
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:48,876
But you knew that.

340
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,389
Aren't you as much to blame for
what's happened as I?

341
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,070
All right.

342
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:11,869
Here's what I'll do.

343
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,833
Gentlemen, we all have assets
to protect here.

344
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,911
Unfortunately, Mr. Nagata's actions...

345
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,991
...have created a rather urgent situation.

346
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,718
It was an unfortunate,

347
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,995
but unavoidable incident.

348
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,479
Your foreman shot a worker.

349
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,470
He was an agitator.

350
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,710
He was a Chinese.

351
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,672
You may have suppressed a
very small strike...

352
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,913
...but in doing so you have started...

353
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,672
...a very large demonstration.

354
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,719
I need to use your pen, please.

355
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:57,910
Here you are, miss.

356
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,152
What about support from
Chiang Kai-shek?

357
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,389
Where does he stand on this?

358
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:08,677
He's a Nationalist. He will stand
on the side of the Chinese.

359
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,870
That's why they call themselves
Nationalists.

360
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,309
Excuse me.

361
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,390
Mr. Townsend.

362
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,995
I think you underestimated the situation.

363
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:23,993
I have three of my mills shut down
because of walk-outs.

364
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,674
There is talk about boycotts.

365
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,790
So, what do you propose?

366
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:29,719
A handful of municipal soldiers is
hardly a show of force.

367
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:30,710
If you'll excuse me.

368
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,391
Mrs. Fane. What a pleasant surprise.

369
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,992
You've rescued me from
a pack of wild bores.

370
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,072
I wouldn't have come if
it wasn't necessary.

371
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,309
Are you all right?

372
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,710
I needed to see you. I'm sorry.

373
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,070
Kitty, this is not the most opportune
time for me to...

374
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:58,675
He knows.

375
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,229
Right.

376
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,399
After you, Mrs. Fane.

377
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:13,912
Hello, Charlie.

378
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,069
Hello, George.

379
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,389
Hello, Townsend.

380
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,230
Adam.

381
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,789
He wants a divorce.

382
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,393
You didn't commit yourself, did you?

383
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,389
Acknowledge anything?

384
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:38,956
No.

385
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,469
Are you sure?

386
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,470
Quite sure.

387
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:45,989
Well.

388
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,471
This is a bloody scrape we're in.

389
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,479
He says he has proof.

390
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:53,796
We deny it.

391
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,995
He can't prove anything.

392
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,992
Besides, it wouldn't do Walter
any good to create a scandal.

393
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,718
But there isn't going to be a scandal.

394
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:03,310
Walter's agreed to let me
divorce him quietly.

395
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,550
That's not so terrible, is it?

396
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,231
Will you hold me?

397
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,629
Of course I will.

398
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,559
Oh, God.

399
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,070
Charlie?

400
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,911
His offer comes with a condition.

401
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,470
I'm not a rich man.

402
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,548
He doesn't want your money.

403
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,629
He's agreed to let me divorce him...

404
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,314
...if Dorothy will agree to divorce you.

405
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,791
And if...

406
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,069
What?

407
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,310
If you'll promise to marry me.

408
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,469
You know, darling, whatever happens,

409
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,073
we must try to keep Dorothy out of it.

410
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:04,994
What do you mean?

411
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,790
We can't only think of ourselves.

412
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,469
I know Dorothy.

413
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,710
Nothing in the world will induce her
to divorce me.

414
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,879
You don't want to divorce her.

415
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,471
It's not just a question of my marriage...

416
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,310
Then what is it?

417
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,550
Do you have any idea of the importance
of my station here?

418
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,470
If I were...

419
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,229
Why are you laughing?

420
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:36,238
I don't think Walter intended for
one minute to divorce me.

421
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,389
He knew you'd let me down.

422
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,310
Try to understand.

423
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,879
I understand, all right.

424
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,876
Kitty! Kitty, please.

425
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,399
We'll work this out, I promise. D...

426
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,309
I'm coming with you.

427
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,551
Good. I thought you might.

428
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,996
I suppose I needn't take more than
a few summer things?

429
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,230
And a shroud?

430
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:19,555
I've told Hassan what you will need.

431
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:20,675
She's packing already.

432
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,478
I wouldn't touch that if I was you.

433
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,548
They may have died in that bed.

434
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:28,869
This can be your room.

435
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,149
You must be the doctor's wife.

436
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,233
I've just met your husband...

437
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,548
...and invited myself to dinner.

438
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,479
I've kept the Watsons' cook for you.

439
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,390
She's not bad.

440
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,232
She'll have to do as your amah as well.

441
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,233
We're a little short-handed here.

442
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,436
Sorry, my name is Waddington.

443
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,150
Oh, yes, of course. Kitty Fane.

444
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:08,869
I'm the Deputy Commissioner.

445
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:09,557
Please.

446
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:13,718
I believe you're one of our neighbors.

447
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,673
Only neighbor, I'm afraid.

448
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,069
Last one standing.

449
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,151
And Watson was the missionary
living here?

450
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,148
Yes. Nice fellow.

451
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,233
American. Lovely family.

452
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,477
I'll show you their graves tomorrow,
if you like.

453
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,315
How kind of you.

454
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,991
I hope your journey wasn't too arduous?

455
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:35,913
We've been traveling for two weeks.

456
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,993
Two weeks? What did you do, swim?

457
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:41,469
No, we didn't come up river.
Came overland.

458
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,309
Whatever for?

459
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,916
Well, we wanted to take in a bit
of the countryside.

460
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,639
Get a bit of sun. Didn't we, darling?

461
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:56,869
Anyone for a cocktail?

462
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,151
Here's luck.

463
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:06,389
I was told I might get some help from
the local army officer.

464
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,399
Colonel Yu, is it?

465
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:12,233
Good luck with him. He's not fond
of us British.

466
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,636
Listen, I'll warn you,

467
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,311
things are pretty dicey even out here.

468
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,711
I'm afraid that if the cholera
doesn't get us,

469
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:21,790
the Nationalists might.

470
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,469
Tried to get those nuns to go,

471
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,629
but they refused.

472
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,310
They all want to be martyrs,
damn them.

473
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,469
And why have you stayed?

474
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,710
I was posted here. Simple as that.

475
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,560
I was shocked to hear you'd volunteered.

476
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:41,152
Opportunity for research.
I couldn't pass it up.

477
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,799
Yes. And you?

478
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:48,152
I don't suppose you've come to
Mei-Tan-Fu for the research.

479
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,389
My husband's the scientist.

480
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:51,152
Indeed.

481
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,998
Did you have any reaction to the
inoculation?

482
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,308
You have been inoculated?

483
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,149
Yes, of course.

484
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:01,311
No guarantee.

485
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:04,153
The Watsons were inoculated,
it didn't do them much good.

486
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,117
Have you brought any gramophone
records?

487
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,391
No, unfortunately not.

488
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,674
Pity. I'm sick of all mine.

489
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:20,990
Listen.

490
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:22,390
What's all that?

491
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:24,877
Across the river.

492
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,989
Trying to frighten off the spirit of death.

493
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,552
I'm going to town in the morning.
Have a look around.

494
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,233
I expect you'll want to rest.

495
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:42,078
I can inoculate you in the evening.

496
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,312
Will you be doing yourself?

497
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:45,789
No, I don't think so.

498
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,069
You needn't bother with me then.

499
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,150
Suit yourself.

500
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:51,910
Tell me, Walter.

501
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,393
Is it a long, drawn-out affair,

502
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,469
dying of cholera?

503
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:58,709
No. All of the fluid goes out of you...

504
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,313
...in the first 36 hours.

505
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:02,238
You die of dehydration, actually.

506
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,991
So, it's messy and very painful.

507
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,275
But it is relatively quick.

508
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:10,716
Good night.

509
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,399
It's rather unfortunate.

510
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:41,795
I thought perhaps that you and
your wife...

511
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:45,549
...you'd like to take precautions in case
you have to leave this place.

512
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:47,551
Do you think all this is really necessary?

513
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:48,675
You can see the picture.

514
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:53,313
I thought you'd like to put
your wife's mind...

515
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,789
...at rest from this situation.

516
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,310
This is Colonel Yu.
He's the KMT's man.

517
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:03,469
He's posting one of his men here
at the house.

518
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,150
Am I a prisoner?

519
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,630
No. It was Mr. Waddington's
idea actually.

520
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,993
He feels we should take precautions.

521
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,469
Precautions against what?

522
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:16,074
A few days ago,
British troops opened fire...

523
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:19,470
...on a group of Chinese workers who
were demonstrating in Shanghai.

524
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,309
Eleven were killed.

525
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:23,993
We've only just heard.

526
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,311
Those were plastered around
the town last night.

527
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,391
(Death to foreign murderers!)

528
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:30,629
I shouldn't worry too much.

529
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:33,391
Even the Nationalists are afraid
of cholera.

530
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:32,994
Do they take that water from the well?

531
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,312
Colonel, can I see where they get
their drinking water?

532
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:37,470
(Imperialist pig!)

533
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:53,799
For starters,
we've got to stop people from...

534
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,672
...using this well until I can test it.

535
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:04,070
Do you understand?

536
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:06,912
Yes, I understand, Dr. Fane.

537
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:10,234
I received my military training
in Moscow.

538
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,319
If you don't like English,

539
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:13,549
we can speak Russian.

540
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,233
English will be fine. Thank you.

541
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:32,876
Here.

542
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:35,631
You have seen cholera before,
yes, Doctor?

543
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:36,914
At the laboratory, of course.

544
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,479
No, I mean in a patient.

545
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,551
No. No, I haven't had the chance

546
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:46,639
Well, I'm not a clinician.

547
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:48,115
Did they not tell you?

548
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:49,628
I'm an infectious disease specialist.

549
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:54,391
Shall we?

550
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:56,676
After you, Doctor.

551
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,079
(Charlie)

552
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:11,550
(without you it is intolerable)

553
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:22,469
I don't need you.

554
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:26,390
Go back!

555
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:36,070
Mr. Waddington?

556
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:42,673
I'm looking for Mr. Waddington.

557
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:59,790
Wait here. All right?

558
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:06,550
Hello?

559
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:08,469
Mr. Waddington?

560
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:19,671
Mrs. Fane?

561
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:22,151
Good morning.

562
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,399
What can I do for you, Mrs. Fane?

563
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:31,911
I found a record for you.

564
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:35,635
Stravinsky.

565
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,152
Very modern. Thank you.

566
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:42,389
Was there something else?

567
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:46,151
I was wondering if you could tell me...

568
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:47,468
...when the post comes through.

569
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:48,549
It's for Shanghai.

570
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:50,478
Unfortunately, since the cholera,

571
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,551
the cowards won't venture
past the river port...

572
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:54,392
...but leave it with me.

573
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:57,230
A local trader I know is making the trip
on Friday.

574
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:00,069
Townsend.

575
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:01,910
Charlie Townsend?

576
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:04,310
Yes. He's an acquaintance
of my husband.

577
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:06,994
Do you know him?

578
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:10,397
Years ago. We were both assigned
to the consulate in Shanghai.

579
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:12,915
Charming wife?

580
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:15,472
Yes. They're very popular, aren't they?

581
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:17,677
He'd made a science of popularity.

582
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:19,879
So, you know his family?

583
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,230
Well, well enough. I like Dorothy.

584
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:25,994
Yes, I understand they're quite
the devoted couple.

585
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:28,639
Oh, he had his little flirtations.

586
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:31,469
Nothing serious.

587
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:35,708
I once heard her say that she found it
most unflattering...

588
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:37,392
...that the women who fell
for her husband...

589
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:39,630
...were so consistently second-rate.

590
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:48,913
Well, enjoy the record.

591
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:51,470
Mrs. Fane?

592
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:54,789
The letter.

593
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:57,316
Right.

594
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,639
Yes, it suddenly occurred to me that
Friday's much too late.

595
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:02,629
Thanks all the same.

596
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,233
Can you pass the salt, please?

597
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:35,989
I'm sorry. Did you say something?

598
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:38,308
Could you pass the salt?

599
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:44,311
Thank you.

600
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:02,119
So, this is how it's going to be?

601
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:06,993
Passing her evenings in silence.

602
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:14,310
Walter.

603
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:18,150
Walter!

604
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:21,990
I wonder if you haven't gone insane.

605
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:31,799
- She's not cooking it.
- Leave it.

606
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:34,070
Leave it.

607
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:36,879
Thank you.

608
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,399
Are you looking to kill yourself?

609
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:27,788
Town well's contaminated.

610
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:39,399
This is dirty. It's dirty.

611
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:21,471
What?

612
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:39,990
Mr. Waddington?

613
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:28,716
Mrs. Fane?

614
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:30,716
Mrs. Fane!

615
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:37,993
Come away. Come away.

616
00:52:58,480 --> 00:52:59,629
What's the matter with Te-Ming?

617
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:03,876
You have the dead man on you.

618
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:06,479
They're very superstitious, aren't they?

619
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:09,913
She's lost three children and a husband
to the cholera.

620
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:12,152
So, you can hardly blame her.

621
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:32,150
You know,

622
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:34,148
this is no place for a woman.

623
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:42,718
When they telegraphed me
that you were

624
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:45,792
coming out, I was astonished.

625
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:51,474
I imagined you might be a grim-visaged
old nurse...

626
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:53,551
...with thick legs and a mustache.

627
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:58,631
I came into the bungalow
and there you were...

628
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,390
...frail and tired...

629
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:05,389
...and very unhappy.

630
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:08,229
It was a long journey.

631
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:10,479
But you're unhappy now.

632
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:14,639
And it occurred to me that you and your

633
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:16,711
husband might be madly in love...

634
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:19,551
...and that you'd simply refused
to stay behind.

635
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,870
That's a reasonable explanation.

636
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:25,151
Yes. But it's not the right one.

637
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:30,153
Do you know what I find strange?

638
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,797
That your husband should never look
at you.

639
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:38,673
He looks at the walls, the floor,
his shoes.

640
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:43,152
He has a great deal on his mind.

641
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:45,559
Yes, I'm sure of it.

642
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:51,070
Dr. Fane!

643
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:52,876
Dr. Fane!

644
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:56,070
Oh, God.

645
00:54:58,720 --> 00:54:59,675
All right.

646
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:32,549
What are you doing?

647
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:37,796
Martini?

648
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:49,915
Yes?

649
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:57,632
I'm the bearer of a message from the
Mother Superior.

650
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:03,556
Who?

651
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:08,552
The nun who supervises the orphanage
and the hospital.

652
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:14,991
I didn't know she was aware of
my existence.

653
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:18,154
Well, apparently Mr. Waddington
has spoken of you.

654
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:21,871
She would very much like to meet
the loving...

655
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:25,553
...loyal wife of the compassionate
Dr. Fane.

656
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:29,789
Right. Then I must prepare myself
for the charade.

657
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:32,553
She does understand if you...

658
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,070
...don't want to venture into the center
of the epidemic.

659
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:38,912
If you're not afraid, why should I be?

660
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:40,869
I forgot.

661
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:43,796
Walter!

662
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:44,910
Oh, my God!

663
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:48,239
Oh, you're drunk.

664
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:26,915
(Foreigner!)

665
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,319
(Go home!)

666
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:47,469
Don't expect anything grand.

667
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:49,073
They're miserably poor.

668
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:10,470
Hello.

669
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:13,229
It's a great pleasure to make
the acquaintance

670
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:15,914
of the wife of our good and brave doctor.

671
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:17,309
Lovely to meet you, too.

672
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,069
Mr. Waddington.

673
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:22,993
You must eat the madeleines.

674
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:26,871
Sister St. Joseph made them for you
herself this morning.

675
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,479
So, tell me, Mrs. Fane.

676
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:37,391
To which faith do you subscribe?

677
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:41,550
Excuse me.

678
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:45,992
We attended services,

679
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,389
not religiously regularly.

680
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:53,075
You could say I'm a member of the
Church of England.

681
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,592
Which is an inoffensive way
of saying you

682
00:58:56,680 --> 00:58:58,557
don't quite believe in anything much.

683
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:02,150
You're very pretty.

684
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:04,549
And very young.

685
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:08,313
I assure you I'm not. I feel ancient.

686
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:15,311
If Mrs. Fane would like to see
over the convent...

687
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:17,994
...and orphanage. I shall be glad
to show her.

688
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:20,709
Alone.

689
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:37,155
We keep the older girls busy
with sewing.

690
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:38,798
It keeps them occupied.

691
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:41,870
And earns money for the convent.

692
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:48,917
That one won't allow us to baptize her.

693
00:59:58,080 --> 00:59:58,990
Our music room.

694
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:02,789
Sister Maryse.

695
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:27,913
Sister Dominique was our pianist.

696
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:31,550
She died last week. Cholera.

697
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:38,789
Through there is the infirmary.

698
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:44,154
It is not a sight one would wish to see.

699
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:48,310
Shall I call Dr. Fane out to see you?

700
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:50,914
No. You needn't disturb him.

701
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:53,389
Now, with the epidemic...

702
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:56,230
...we have even more to care for.

703
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:59,311
This baby was brought in this morning.

704
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:01,559
Another orphan.

705
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:10,075
She says Dr. Fane loves babies.

706
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:14,678
He spends as much time as he can
in the nursery.

707
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:23,790
Mrs. Fane?

708
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:26,875
Mrs. Fane?

709
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:29,150
You all right?

710
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:30,636
Yes.

711
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:33,230
It's nothing...

712
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,228
...only foolishness.
