You, me, Smitty and
those Swedish med students,

155
00:08:40,053 --> 00:08:41,964
who I believe were twins.

156
00:08:42,122 --> 00:08:44,159
First, they weren't Swedish.
Irish.

157
00:08:44,324 --> 00:08:47,669
Secondly, they weren't med students,
they were nursing students.

158
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:50,000
Finally, they weren't even twins.
What?

159
00:08:50,163 --> 00:08:51,335
No, they were triplets.

160
00:08:51,498 --> 00:08:52,738
(BOTH LAUGH)

161
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:56,176
I could kick myself for not writing a book,
not that anybody would believe it.

162
00:08:56,336 --> 00:08:57,838
Yeah, that's a good point.

163
00:08:58,004 --> 00:09:00,883
Aw... Hey, ladies and gentlemen.

164
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:04,818
You all remember George Dryer?
How you doing?

165
00:09:05,512 --> 00:09:07,185
What have you been up to?

166
00:09:07,347 --> 00:09:11,159
You were doing some real estate
deal up in Canada or something?

167
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:14,059
What do you know about
Canada? Or real estate?

168
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:19,033
Well, it was vacation homes in Winnipeg.
I was just a spokesman, so...

169
00:09:19,192 --> 00:09:20,865
And you had a sports bar, right?

170
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:23,906
Yeah, yeah, I had a bar.
You know, the economy.

171
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:26,670
Right, right.
Didn't work out.

172
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:30,110
Actually, I've been thinking
now about something you suggested.

173
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:32,272
Like sports-casting.

174
00:09:32,439 --> 00:09:35,750
I made a demo.

175
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:38,788
I thought I would...
You know, I'd show it to you first.

176
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:41,721
No, I'll definitely
take a look at it. Heh.

177
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:45,226
They're always looking for someone
to replace me around here.

178
00:09:45,385 --> 00:09:47,922
Chip, you're on.
Oh, shit. Uh...

179
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:52,195
Hey, look, put this on my desk, all right.
It belongs to my man here.

180
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:56,067
Listen, uh, take care, man.

181
00:09:56,229 --> 00:09:57,299
All right, man.

182
00:09:57,464 --> 00:09:59,637
Good to see you.
Always good to see you.

183
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:01,608
Stick around if you want.

184
00:10:02,869 --> 00:10:05,645
Hey, man. How's it going?
I'm good, I'm good.

185
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:06,943
George Dryer, huh?

186
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:11,249
Yeah, back in the day that man
got more ass than a toilet seat.

187
00:10:11,411 --> 00:10:13,152
Hang on, here we go.

188
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:14,952
(♪♪♪)

189
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:18,255
All right, soccer fans,
big game going on today.

190
00:10:18,418 --> 00:10:23,094
Joining us with a look at the matchups
in that clash is of course Chip Johnson.

191
00:10:23,256 --> 00:10:24,291
Chip, what do you have?

192
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:28,928
When our beloved DC United faces off
with the Revolution this afternoon,

193
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:31,268
it's all gonna come down
to defense.

194
00:10:31,431 --> 00:10:34,503
Unfortunately for us, Jerry, the
black and red have that in spades...

195
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:36,669
(CHIP SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)

196

BOY:
Coach, should we keep going?

197
00:10:55,255 --> 00:10:57,701
That's good. Just keep
doing what you're doing.

198
00:10:57,857 --> 00:11:01,430
Put your foot into it.
Kick it with your toes.

199
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:03,167
Just straight on.

200
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:06,139
Like I told you
a hundred times.

201
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:07,869
(♪♪♪)

202
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:11,504
GEORGE:
Hey, kiddo, give me the ball.

203
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:15,150
COACH:
Just use your toes.

204
00:11:15,308 --> 00:11:19,279
Okay, anybody want to know
how to shoot?

205
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:21,721
LEWIS: Dad, what are you doing?
GEORGE: No, it's fine.

206
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:25,192
All right, any of you want to
score some goals this season?

207
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:26,796
KIDS:
Yeah.

208
00:11:26,953 --> 00:11:28,728
GEORGE:
Okay, go in the goal, okay?

209
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:32,802
So first of all you need to know
that you don't kick with your toe.

210
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,667
You plant your foot here
and you follow through.

211
00:11:35,828 --> 00:11:36,966
On the laces, okay?

212
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:40,134
You gotta plant your left foot down
and follow through.

213
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,540
KIDS:
Whoa!

214
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:42,975
GEORGE:
Who wants to learn how to do that?

215
00:11:43,136 --> 00:11:46,515
KIDS: Me!
GEORGE: All right, come on, let's go.

216
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,745
Give him some encouragement.
Oh...

217
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:55,518
Left foot next to the ball, right
foot follows through. Come on.

218

Thattaboy, terrific.

220
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:01,722
We're learning how to shoot.
We're learning how to score.

221
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:04,232
Okay, here we are, here we go.

222
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,165
Yeah. Oh!

223
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:09,668
You just can't...
Okay, anybody else want to go?

224
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:12,673
Okay, who's gonna go?
You? Okay, on you go.

(♪♪♪)

226
00:12:18,204 --> 00:12:20,548
All right, there we go.

227
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:23,084
Home, sweet home.

228
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:25,619
Did you enjoy that?
Yes.

229
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:28,958
You're really good, Dad.
Thank you.

230
00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:32,556
Bye, Dad.
All right.

231
00:12:32,719 --> 00:12:34,460
Bye, champ.
Bye.

232
00:12:34,621 --> 00:12:37,693
I'll see you Saturday, okay?
Okay.

Hello, George.

STACIE: <i>Hey, am I bothering you?</i>

239
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:01,888
No, no. I was just, um...

240
00:13:02,048 --> 00:13:03,493
I was in a meeting.

241
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:06,631
You always were good
at first impressions, weren't you?

242
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,094
What do you mean?

243
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:12,669
Well, you were such a splash at practice
that the parents want you to coach.

244
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:15,772
Wait, what?
What are you talking about?

245
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:19,273
Yeah, I know. The kids loved you.
Lewis won't shut up about it.

246
00:13:20,433 --> 00:13:22,743
What about the coach they have?
<i>I don't know.</i>

247
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:25,348
He doesn't have time.
They want you to do it.

248
00:13:25,505 --> 00:13:27,507
I'm flattered, Stace. Really, I am.

249
00:13:27,674 --> 00:13:31,486
But I'm kind of in the middle of
a couple of things right now...

250
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:34,853
George, when was the last time
you did anything for Lewis?

251
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:37,620
And I don't mean
a couple of hours at the park.

Okay, everybody. Now listen up.
Now, this is Lewis' dad, George.

256
00:13:50,096 --> 00:13:53,873
He's your new coach. I'm gonna be the
assistant coach. Which I'm fine with.

Thanks a lot, Coach Jacob.

259
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:04,148
Uh, in any event, I'm Lewis' dad
and I've never coached before,

260
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:07,621
but I have played the game
since I was your age,

261
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:10,818
and ifs a great game.

262
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:13,725
The only thing I'm gonna
ask you to do on your own,

263
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:16,890
do 10 minutes a day
passing the ball about.

Anybody you can find.

265
00:14:18,558 --> 00:14:21,368
I mean, you guys have all
got a brother or a mother

266
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:24,007
or a sister or somebody. Yeah.

267
00:14:24,664 --> 00:14:27,838
Coach, I had a sister,
but she died.

Oh, really?

269

I have a brother.
Should I play with him?

Yeah, that would... That'd be good.
Coach, my grandpa died of smoking.

On you go, Lewis. Show them
how it's done. Well done.

I'm Hunter's dad. Where is that guy?
Told him I'd come by after work.

That's right.
I gotta say,

282
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:12,220
I was a little bit thrilled when I found
out I had a soccer great coaching my boy.

283
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:16,121
You were a great, great player.
Really, really.

Those days are gone.

285
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:20,190
Oh, no, no.
We looked you up on YouTube.

286
00:15:20,353 --> 00:15:23,095
You were one tough
son of a bitch.

287
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:25,793
I mean, I used to
play baseball in college.

288
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:28,302
Nothing anything like
on your level, though.

289
00:15:28,461 --> 00:15:30,134
I don't want to take your time.

290
00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:34,108
I just wanted to let you know
how much I really, really appreciate

291
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:37,908
what you're doing for my son
and for all the other kids out here.

292
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:40,277
You could be doing
so many more glamorous things.

293
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,647
Pfft. I don't know about that.

294
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:47,485
Look, I do this every year. I sponsor
the team. It pays for the trophies.

295
00:15:47,647 --> 00:15:50,423
It buys the uniforms, what not.
It's for the kids.

296
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:54,493
Wow, I'm sure everyone appreciates it.
Yeah, yeah.

297
00:15:54,654 --> 00:15:59,603
And if you want to let Hunter play goalie, great.
Just keep it low-key.

298
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,295
Goalie it is.
Okay.

299
00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:04,770
And I have a daughter.
Sings like Barbra Streisand.

300
00:16:04,931 --> 00:16:08,401
She sings the national anthem
before a game, so much the better.

301
00:16:08,568 --> 00:16:10,241
(LAUGHS)

302
00:16:10,403 --> 00:16:12,246
Just keep it...
Low-key.

303
00:16:12,405 --> 00:16:16,353
You'll get to know me, I'm always
looking for something interesting.

304
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:19,319
Hunter, you listen to Coach Dryer.
HUNTER: All right, Dad.

305
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:21,083

Bye-bye, Lewis.

457
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:26,795
Well, so much for
a fun first sleep over, huh?

458
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:32,638
Good night.

459
00:25:33,565 --> 00:25:35,875
Will you just give him
some time?

460
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:40,513
You know you didn't lose him
overnight.

461

more grown-up than me, Stace?

Yep, there he is.

Okay. Bye, Mom.

Hey, kiddo.

You're looking
very sharp there.

470
00:26:16,208 --> 00:26:18,051
What's the story?
I don't know.

471
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:19,553
How are you, man?
Good.

472
00:26:19,711 --> 00:26:22,590
Hey, George, George!
Yeah, I'll call you back.

Hey, look Patti and I,

476
00:26:29,521 --> 00:26:32,229
we're putting together
this soiree for Friday.

We wanted to know if you could join us.
This Friday?

478
00:26:35,561 --> 00:26:38,132
Personally, I'd be
very grateful if you could.

479

I've got these guys I'm doing a deal with.
They would love to meet you.

480
00:26:42,234 --> 00:26:46,740
I think you'll have a great time. I put
together a really good group of people.

481
00:26:46,905 --> 00:26:50,045
Be a lot of opportunities there
if you know what I mean.

482
00:26:51,577 --> 00:26:53,921

That makes me very happy.

Hi.

00:27:09,394 --> 00:27:12,773
I just wanted to thank you
for the other day.

491

Don't worry, I'm not gonna have another

I just wanted to say thank you.

493
00:27:19,838 --> 00:27:23,945
You're welcome, Barb.
That's fine, you're welcome.

494
00:27:24,343 --> 00:27:27,688
You seem to be getting over it...

Pull his jersey a bit.
Yeah, give him a little elbow.

498

I just wanted to tell you
that I ran into a mutual friend of ours.

503
00:27:52,437 --> 00:27:54,940
Chip Johnston. Uh-huh.
Chip Johnston?

504
00:27:55,107 --> 00:27:56,643
No way.
Mm-hm.

505
00:27:56,808 --> 00:28:01,018
I was at CSA when he first started there.
God, what a small world, huh?

506
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:05,890
So sports-casting, huh, George?
Apparently pretty damn good too.

507
00:28:06,051 --> 00:28:08,395
He said that?
You think he was for real?

508
00:28:08,554 --> 00:28:11,501
I'll find out tonight.
He gave me a copy to watch.

509
00:28:11,657 --> 00:28:14,695
So who knows, maybe
I know someone I can give it to.

510
00:28:15,661 --> 00:28:18,699
Yeah, I'd appreciate that.
I'll let you know, coach.

I got a stack of twenties here,
doesn't anybody want one?

514
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:35,583
Well, then hit
the Gatorade bottle.

515
00:28:35,747 --> 00:28:38,990
I bet you coach can do it.
A great idea. Come here.

Can you hit this?

I apologize. I'm so sorry."

1080

In the early years, when I used to play
and you were in the stands watching me.

1081
01:03:09,252 --> 01:03:13,257
After every game, I would look for you
and I would wave to you. Remember?

Mm-hm.

And no matter how badly I played,
how massively I screwed up,

1084
01:03:19,229 --> 01:03:23,769
I always knew when you waved back at
me, everything would be all right.

1085
01:03:23,933 --> 01:03:29,144
I mean, I felt like the most special
person in the world when you did that.

Until I'd look behind and six other women
were all waving back along with me.

He doesn't hate you.

He just hates being disappointed,
and you've done that a lot, okay?
