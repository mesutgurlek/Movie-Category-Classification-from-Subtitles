1
00:00:18,959 --> 00:00:20,084
My mom said

2
00:00:20,584 --> 00:00:23,876
color and smell have a huge effect
on people's moods.

3
00:00:24,709 --> 00:00:25,584
So I wonder,

4
00:00:26,042 --> 00:00:28,084
if that theory is true,

5
00:00:28,542 --> 00:00:31,334
what colors make me excited, or nervous?

6
00:00:32,001 --> 00:00:33,501
Or happy, or worried?

7
00:00:34,251 --> 00:00:36,167
And what are the smells that make me...

8
00:00:36,626 --> 00:00:38,417
giddy one minute

9
00:00:39,126 --> 00:00:40,792
and hysterical the next,

10
00:00:41,417 --> 00:00:43,167
that fill me with so much love I forget where I am,

11
00:00:43,751 --> 00:00:45,376
or so stubborn about something I can't let go.

12
00:00:46,626 --> 00:00:47,501
Gong Ning,

13
00:00:48,251 --> 00:00:49,126
But I know,

14
00:00:49,751 --> 00:00:53,459
you're the reason I feel all these emotions.

15
00:01:28,417 --> 00:01:30,667
It's 3:30 on the 15th.

16
00:01:32,709 --> 00:01:33,251
Gong Ning,

17
00:01:34,126 --> 00:01:36,917
if I hadn't just listened to
what I recorded for you yesterday,

18
00:01:37,542 --> 00:01:39,876
I wouldn't remember any of what I said to you.

19
00:01:42,542 --> 00:01:44,542
I guess my memory is getting worse.

20
00:01:47,251 --> 00:01:50,459
Have I said that to you before too?

21
00:01:55,167 --> 00:01:56,376
A kid named Ming got a new haircut.

22
00:01:56,626 --> 00:01:58,834
The next day, all the kids at school laughed at him.

23
00:01:59,084 --> 00:02:00,709
They said, "Your new haircut looks like a kite!"

24
00:02:01,126 --> 00:02:03,876
Ming was hurt, and he ran outside
and started crying.

25
00:02:04,292 --> 00:02:05,751
He cried, and he cried, and cried...

26
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:07,542
and then a gust of wind caught him, and he flew.

27
00:02:13,417 --> 00:02:14,084
Your turn.

28
00:02:14,584 --> 00:02:16,167
A centipede, spider, and ant

29
00:02:16,542 --> 00:02:18,542
go to help their friend the butterfly move.

30
00:02:18,917 --> 00:02:19,501
And then?

31
00:02:21,376 --> 00:02:22,709
Hey, knock it off!

32
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:24,001
I'm not even done and you're laughing.

33
00:02:24,501 --> 00:02:25,792
Hon, butterflies don't have homes.

34
00:02:29,751 --> 00:02:30,834
Technical foul, you lose. Hand it over.

35
00:02:34,084 --> 00:02:35,251
So much for childhood innocence...

36
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,084
The sweating and the forgetfulness

37
00:02:39,334 --> 00:02:41,376
are just side effects of her medicine,
nothing you need to worry about.

38
00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:44,042
Her condition is hereditary,

39
00:02:44,584 --> 00:02:46,542
it's very different from ordinary myasthenia gravis.

40
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:49,209
So what about what we just talked about?

41
00:02:50,917 --> 00:02:52,001
She needs to avoid physical exertion.

42
00:02:52,917 --> 00:02:53,626
I'm sure you know

43
00:02:53,876 --> 00:02:56,709
Respiratory muscle paralysis
can be life threatening.

44
00:02:57,167 --> 00:02:59,751
Even though other doctors might not agree,

45
00:03:00,167 --> 00:03:03,709
I think, for her safety,
we should increase her dosage,

46
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:06,792
or the risk of muscle paralysis is too high.

47
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:33,709
Rock Rock Rock

48
00:03:35,084 --> 00:03:38,001
"I have a donkey, and I never rode it"

49
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:41,334
"But one day, I got bored,
and rode it to the market"

50
00:03:41,542 --> 00:03:44,667
"I felt so proud with my little whip in my hand"

51
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,042
"Then suddenly I slipped off and fell in the mud"

52
00:03:49,167 --> 00:03:53,501
Rock Rock Rock

53
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:57,042
"I have a donkey"

54
00:03:58,292 --> 00:04:00,376
"I have a donkey"

55
00:04:01,626 --> 00:04:04,626
"I have a donkey, and I never rode it"

56
00:04:04,876 --> 00:04:08,001
"But one day, I got bored,
and rode it to the market"

57
00:04:08,251 --> 00:04:11,209
"I felt so proud with my little whip in my hand"

58
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:13,709
"Then suddenly..."

59
00:04:49,584 --> 00:04:50,709
Sorry, sorry... Are you ok?

60
00:04:50,917 --> 00:04:52,251
Sorry, my rooster acts up sometimes.
You're not hurt, are you?

61
00:04:55,542 --> 00:04:56,334
Song Shiqiao?!

62
00:04:59,292 --> 00:05:00,376
Are you Song Shiqiao?

63
00:05:04,126 --> 00:05:04,876
I'm Gong Ning.

64
00:05:09,667 --> 00:05:12,001
That rooster belongs to our guitarist, Chunzi.

65
00:05:12,417 --> 00:05:14,751
It hatched from an egg he bought a few years ago.

66
00:05:14,917 --> 00:05:16,084
And back then, it was cute,

67
00:05:16,876 --> 00:05:18,042
so he didn't want to get rid of it.

68
00:05:22,501 --> 00:05:23,792
You've changed a lot.

69
00:05:25,001 --> 00:05:26,334
I couldn't tell it was you at all.

70
00:05:27,334 --> 00:05:28,209
Well, yeah!

71
00:05:30,917 --> 00:05:32,792
With this thing on, who could tell it was me?

72
00:05:33,209 --> 00:05:35,251
If it weren't for those weird hiccups of yours

73
00:05:35,459 --> 00:05:37,917
I'd never guess you were the same girl
who sat behind me in class.

74
00:05:38,626 --> 00:05:40,167
Do you remember that time in math class

75
00:05:41,709 --> 00:05:43,667
when a cockroach flew out of the wall?

76
00:05:45,376 --> 00:05:47,751
Everybody else was screaming, but you hiccuped.

77
00:05:49,792 --> 00:05:51,167
I get the hiccups when I'm nervous.

78
00:05:53,126 --> 00:05:54,417
That was chemistry, wasn't it?

79
00:05:56,042 --> 00:05:56,917
Math.

80
00:06:10,376 --> 00:06:11,417
This is my cell number.

81
00:06:11,834 --> 00:06:12,751
Call me sometime.

82
00:06:14,917 --> 00:06:16,042
I have to go let the organizers tear me a new one.

83
00:06:23,459 --> 00:06:24,126
Bye.

84
00:06:54,751 --> 00:06:55,542
What's wrong?

85
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:57,167
Are you tired? Does something hurt?

86
00:06:59,709 --> 00:07:00,376
Mom...

87
00:07:01,792 --> 00:07:04,667
is this medicine making me stupid?

88
00:07:05,834 --> 00:07:06,709
Why would it?

89
00:07:07,876 --> 00:07:09,792
I feel like my memory is getting worse.

90
00:07:11,834 --> 00:07:14,334
I met someone I used to go to high school with,

91
00:07:15,084 --> 00:07:16,626
But I could hardly recognize him.

92
00:07:19,001 --> 00:07:19,792
Boy or girl?

93
00:07:21,001 --> 00:07:21,917
Boy.

94
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:24,167
Same homeroom?

95
00:07:25,501 --> 00:07:28,251
We were in the same lit class, junior year.

96
00:07:28,917 --> 00:07:29,751
But, after a few months,

97
00:07:30,001 --> 00:07:31,834
he cleaned out his desk and left.

98
00:07:32,376 --> 00:07:34,876
I think it had something to do with his dad's job,

99
00:07:35,209 --> 00:07:36,126
so he had to transfer.

100
00:07:37,001 --> 00:07:37,751
You liked him?

101
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:40,459
No!

102
00:07:41,917 --> 00:07:43,834
Then it's normal you wouldn't recognize him!

103
00:07:44,167 --> 00:07:45,084
You didn't know him very well.

104
00:07:51,459 --> 00:07:52,334
I'm gonna go take a shower.

105
00:07:55,167 --> 00:07:56,334
Viewed vertically,

106
00:07:56,917 --> 00:07:58,209
Romantic literature

107
00:07:58,792 --> 00:08:00,792
was a direct descendant

108
00:08:01,459 --> 00:08:03,834
(GONG NING'S MOBILE NUMBER)

109
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:08,667
It was also a protest against the rigid confines

110
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:10,001
of French Classicism.

111
00:08:11,459 --> 00:08:13,667
Horizontally,

112
00:08:14,376 --> 00:08:15,501
Romantic literature

113
00:08:27,501 --> 00:08:28,209
Sorry.

114
00:08:33,584 --> 00:08:34,834
Song Shiqiao!

115
00:08:35,126 --> 00:08:36,501
Why haven't you called me?

116
00:08:36,917 --> 00:08:38,292
I keep my phone on 24 hours a day

117
00:08:38,584 --> 00:08:39,459
because I'm waiting to hear from you.

118
00:08:39,709 --> 00:08:40,584
Do you know how rude you're being?

119
00:08:42,042 --> 00:08:42,792
Are you mad at me?

120
00:08:43,167 --> 00:08:44,167
For what?!

121
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,209
Hey, did you get taller on me?

122
00:08:47,084 --> 00:08:47,709
Gong Ning!

123
00:08:54,751 --> 00:08:55,292
Sorry...

124
00:08:57,459 --> 00:08:58,167
Good luck!

125
00:08:59,084 --> 00:09:00,376
You're in a different costume today.

126
00:09:01,001 --> 00:09:02,292
Yeah, we draw straws for them.

127
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:04,667
You must have got the short one, to be wearing that.

128
00:09:04,917 --> 00:09:06,042
I'm not cute?

129
00:09:06,751 --> 00:09:07,334
Holy crap,

130
00:09:07,792 --> 00:09:10,001
you can't see anything in this.

131
00:09:10,584 --> 00:09:11,667
Are you still in college?

132
00:09:12,376 --> 00:09:13,126
I sit in on class.

133
00:09:14,126 --> 00:09:16,876
We got expelled because of that chicken.

134
00:09:17,126 --> 00:09:19,167
We're actually a grunge rock band.

135
00:09:19,542 --> 00:09:21,126
Grunge Grunge ROCK.

136
00:09:21,626 --> 00:09:23,751
Cobain, Nirvana!

137
00:09:25,084 --> 00:09:25,667
Bye! Hello?

138
00:09:27,834 --> 00:09:28,542
Gong Ning,

139
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,792
I had a feeling I'd see you today,

140
00:09:31,292 --> 00:09:33,709
and then there you were, at my school.

141
00:09:35,334 --> 00:09:36,876
You said you would take me somewhere special,

142
00:09:37,334 --> 00:09:38,917
and I said, ok, someday soon.

143
00:09:39,376 --> 00:09:40,042
Ok.

144
00:09:41,126 --> 00:09:42,001
You're not going to ask why?

145
00:09:43,001 --> 00:09:44,626
It's Friday.

146
00:09:46,084 --> 00:09:47,167
I remember, in high school,

147
00:09:47,459 --> 00:09:49,126
you went to the hospital every Friday.

148
00:09:50,001 --> 00:09:51,667
I never thought you'd actually remember.

149
00:09:53,792 --> 00:09:57,084
I remember you always used to lose your keys
in high school,

150
00:09:57,501 --> 00:09:59,209
and you'd empty your backpack looking for them.

151
00:10:00,209 --> 00:10:01,209
You still do that.

152
00:10:06,792 --> 00:10:07,876
My mom's here to pick me up.

153
00:10:24,792 --> 00:10:25,751
Do you still remember this?

154
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:29,209
You used to have this tape recorder in your hand
all the time.

155
00:10:29,626 --> 00:10:30,792
You used to record the songs

156
00:10:31,084 --> 00:10:32,626
you wrote for guitar on it,

157
00:10:33,084 --> 00:10:34,751
and you'd listen to them over and over,

158
00:10:35,126 --> 00:10:36,084
looking for mistakes.

159
00:10:37,042 --> 00:10:38,126
So why do you have it?

160
00:10:38,667 --> 00:10:39,459
Did I give it to you?

161
00:10:41,001 --> 00:10:43,792
Once, when you were listening in class,
the teacher took it.

162
00:10:44,584 --> 00:10:46,126
One day, I had monitor duty,

163
00:10:46,334 --> 00:10:47,959
and I saw it on the teacher's desk,

164
00:10:48,251 --> 00:10:49,501
so I took it.

165
00:10:50,001 --> 00:10:51,501
I wanted to give it back to you.

166
00:10:52,292 --> 00:10:54,709
But you transferred to another school.

167
00:11:15,376 --> 00:11:16,084
Let's go.

168
00:11:21,667 --> 00:11:23,376
You're three minutes and thirty-seven seconds late.

169
00:11:24,667 --> 00:11:25,792
Calm down.

170
00:11:27,292 --> 00:11:28,667
I'll give you four minutes. Keep the change.

171
00:11:29,292 --> 00:11:30,042
Get on.

172
00:11:32,501 --> 00:11:33,167
Get on.

173
00:12:01,792 --> 00:12:03,251
I remember how you

174
00:12:03,501 --> 00:12:05,792
used to draw all over your textbooks in high school.

175
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:07,876
Did I? I don't remember.

176
00:12:09,251 --> 00:12:11,334
Memories are like the raindrops in my hand.

177
00:12:11,751 --> 00:12:14,501
The tighter you grab it, the faster it slips away.

178
00:12:15,917 --> 00:12:18,917
Actually you're a lot different than I remember.

179
00:12:22,834 --> 00:12:24,542
Then how do you remember me?

180
00:12:34,501 --> 00:12:35,501
This is a glow-in-the-dark pen.

181
00:12:35,709 --> 00:12:37,501
Go home and turn the lights off,
and you'll be able to read it.

182
00:12:38,751 --> 00:12:39,417
Let's go.

183
00:12:41,709 --> 00:12:42,376
Hey...

184
00:12:43,126 --> 00:12:43,959
Do you hear that?

185
00:12:45,167 --> 00:12:46,834
Do you remember that fat music teacher
we used to have?

186
00:12:47,126 --> 00:12:48,042
You mean the Latin fanatic?

187
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:48,792
Yeah.

188
00:12:49,042 --> 00:12:49,834
Every time he put this song on

189
00:12:50,417 --> 00:12:51,626
he always got up and danced,

190
00:12:52,209 --> 00:12:53,959
and we'd always used to dance behind him?.

191
00:13:40,626 --> 00:13:41,334
Mom...

192
00:13:51,376 --> 00:13:53,084
So, you're Gong Ning?

193
00:13:54,001 --> 00:13:54,626
Hello, ma'am.

194
00:13:56,501 --> 00:13:57,876
Where are you two going so late?

195
00:13:58,959 --> 00:13:59,626
...Out.

196
00:14:00,876 --> 00:14:03,167
Gong Ning, you're a student, right?

197
00:14:03,626 --> 00:14:04,834
Show me your student ID.

198
00:14:05,876 --> 00:14:06,709
...I quit.

199
00:14:07,834 --> 00:14:08,626
...You quit.

200
00:14:09,751 --> 00:14:10,542
...Then your ID?

201
00:14:12,292 --> 00:14:13,084
I didn't bring it.

202
00:14:13,459 --> 00:14:14,251
Mom...

203
00:14:14,876 --> 00:14:16,292
quit acting like a fascist.

204
00:14:17,792 --> 00:14:18,459
Ma'am,

205
00:14:19,209 --> 00:14:20,001
how about this,

206
00:14:21,001 --> 00:14:22,584
tomorrow, when I come to see Shiqiao...

207
00:14:22,834 --> 00:14:23,501
You think you're seeing her tomorrow?

208
00:14:25,001 --> 00:14:25,584
That's the plan.

209
00:14:26,417 --> 00:14:29,459
Tomorrow I'm bringing Shiqiao
to my friend's dance studio...

210
00:14:30,334 --> 00:14:31,292
You're dancing now?

211
00:14:32,126 --> 00:14:32,876
No...

212
00:14:33,417 --> 00:14:34,917
I'm just going to see it.

213
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:37,084
Ok. I'm going home.

214
00:15:12,292 --> 00:15:13,001
"Oh, "

215
00:15:14,834 --> 00:15:15,251
Good morning, fish.

216
00:15:15,709 --> 00:15:16,876
"Rocker... Rocker..."

217
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:22,876
"I am a rocker... I am a rocker..."

218
00:15:23,876 --> 00:15:24,542
Mom?

219
00:15:29,209 --> 00:15:30,876
How come you're not at the cafe?

220
00:15:31,292 --> 00:15:32,334
I'm staying home with you today.

221
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:36,501
(GONG NING calling...)

222
00:15:44,376 --> 00:15:46,626
When did I say you could have a boyfriend?

223
00:15:47,084 --> 00:15:48,001
Mom...

224
00:15:48,917 --> 00:15:49,626
Back to your room.

225
00:15:50,584 --> 00:15:51,292
Go on.

226
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,001
(I'm on the roof!)

227
00:17:15,876 --> 00:17:17,167
Having fun up there?

228
00:17:17,709 --> 00:17:19,917
I got you a drink. Enjoy.

229
00:17:34,959 --> 00:17:37,209
Why doesn't your mom like me?

230
00:17:37,917 --> 00:17:39,959
Did you tell her all the dirty secrets from my past?

231
00:17:48,334 --> 00:17:49,501
I told you,

232
00:17:49,834 --> 00:17:51,959
I can't dance because of my disease.

233
00:17:52,209 --> 00:17:52,876
So,

234
00:17:53,126 --> 00:17:56,042
you should never mention anything about
dancing around her.

235
00:17:56,667 --> 00:17:58,792
It's the one thing that drives her crazy.

236
00:18:00,501 --> 00:18:02,042
Enough of that. Sing me something.

237
00:18:03,542 --> 00:18:04,376
What do you want to hear?

238
00:18:08,209 --> 00:18:10,417
Something... gentle.

239
00:18:26,209 --> 00:18:35,417
"Sometimes, I think people don't understand,
and I bear the loneliness alone

240
00:18:37,417 --> 00:18:47,209
Up here without you, there's a loss I always feel

241
00:18:48,876 --> 00:18:54,292
But your smile is still like a rainbow

242
00:18:54,542 --> 00:18:58,417
spreading softly across my heart

243
00:19:00,167 --> 00:19:09,792
And from now on, I'll never fear the rain

244
00:19:11,167 --> 00:19:22,417
Holding hands and being together,
and it's all we'll need to be happy

245
00:19:22,667 --> 00:19:26,334
Now I know fate is real"

246
00:19:27,709 --> 00:19:28,459
Mom...

247
00:19:31,292 --> 00:19:32,001
Tell him to come down here.

248
00:19:34,792 --> 00:19:35,626
He can stay for dinner.

249
00:19:46,209 --> 00:19:46,959
Ok, so, you,

250
00:19:47,376 --> 00:19:48,709
you're young, but you're tricky.

251
00:19:49,376 --> 00:19:50,834
You're lucky it's just sunburn.

252
00:19:51,292 --> 00:19:53,167
What if you'd fallen off the roof?

253
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:55,042
What would your parents do?

254
00:19:57,501 --> 00:19:58,209
They'd laugh.

255
00:19:58,876 --> 00:19:59,792
What do your parents do?

256
00:20:00,792 --> 00:20:01,584
They're abroad.

257
00:20:02,209 --> 00:20:03,167
What do they do abroad?

258
00:20:03,584 --> 00:20:04,667
They're on sabbatical abroad.

259
00:20:05,376 --> 00:20:06,626
Why aren't you in school?

260
00:20:06,959 --> 00:20:07,667
I tried.

261
00:20:07,876 --> 00:20:10,334
But university is boring, so I withdrew.

262
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:12,792
I wanted more time to work on my band.

263
00:20:13,709 --> 00:20:14,709
What's your band called?

264
00:20:15,501 --> 00:20:16,334
"Psychological Abnormality"

265
00:20:17,959 --> 00:20:18,709
It fits.

266
00:20:18,959 --> 00:20:20,751
You'd have to be abnormal to climb
on other people's roofs.

267
00:20:26,376 --> 00:20:28,209
Don't come back too late tonight, alright?

268
00:20:47,376 --> 00:20:48,959
Right, Shiqiao, I just realized,

269
00:20:49,209 --> 00:20:50,834
you and the rooster are the same sign!

270
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:52,209
Yeah, they are.

271
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:54,251
He hatched sometime around this season.

272
00:20:54,542 --> 00:20:56,501
The egg was laid in the winter.

273
00:20:56,917 --> 00:20:59,501
A blizzard raged on that cold,
blustery winter night.

274
00:20:59,917 --> 00:21:01,459
We don't get snow in the winter down here.

275
00:21:02,001 --> 00:21:04,501
Right, but Chunzi brought the rooster
from back home in the northeast.

276
00:21:05,251 --> 00:21:07,167
Does it snow every year in your hometown?

277
00:21:07,542 --> 00:21:08,417
Yeah!

278
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:10,709
And it always manages to snow right
when I'm going home every year.

279
00:21:11,001 --> 00:21:14,292
The whole city gets encased in ice.

280
00:21:15,459 --> 00:21:17,084
Don't tell me you've never seen snow...

281
00:21:18,626 --> 00:21:19,667
I've seen it in movies.

282
00:21:20,917 --> 00:21:22,042
This cannot stand.

283
00:21:22,334 --> 00:21:25,376
If you want to come this winter,
you can stay with me.

284
00:21:27,209 --> 00:21:28,667
I can't leave my doctor.

285
00:21:29,042 --> 00:21:30,626
I have to get a checkup every week.

286
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:34,084
Let's get off this subject.

287
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:36,001
I'll show you guys a magic trick.

288
00:21:36,417 --> 00:21:37,292
Watch.

289
00:21:42,209 --> 00:21:43,292
Gimme that!

290
00:21:43,584 --> 00:21:44,417
Gimme that!

291
00:21:45,209 --> 00:21:46,042
Gimme that!

292
00:21:46,917 --> 00:21:47,667
2...

293
00:21:48,126 --> 00:21:48,834
3...

294
00:21:49,417 --> 00:21:50,251
4...

295
00:21:51,001 --> 00:21:51,709
5...

296
00:21:52,292 --> 00:21:53,084
6...

297
00:21:53,626 --> 00:21:54,251
7...

298
00:21:54,417 --> 00:21:55,084
What are you recording?

299
00:21:55,417 --> 00:21:56,209
Footsteps.

300
00:22:00,126 --> 00:22:04,501
4... 5... 6... 7...

301
00:22:08,167 --> 00:22:09,667
What does running feel like?

302
00:22:11,334 --> 00:22:14,042
Ever since I can remember, my mom always said

303
00:22:14,501 --> 00:22:17,709
I couldn't move too fast,
that running would kill me,

304
00:22:18,417 --> 00:22:20,876
so I've never known what it's like to run.

305
00:22:21,959 --> 00:22:23,917
It must be like riding a bike
that's going really fast.

306
00:22:25,126 --> 00:22:27,334
But that's not right, bikes are too steady.

307
00:22:37,959 --> 00:22:39,667
Please don't make this hard for me, Sir.

308
00:22:40,167 --> 00:22:41,376
Your son will blame me if he finds out.

309
00:22:41,709 --> 00:22:42,501
Hey, my store!

310
00:22:45,292 --> 00:22:47,917
Let go! Don't touch me!

311
00:22:50,709 --> 00:22:51,876
Let go of me!

312
00:22:53,959 --> 00:22:56,459
I... I know this sweater is important to you.

313
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:59,792
If I want liquor, you get it for me!
I gave you money!

314
00:23:00,001 --> 00:23:00,667
Stop drinking.

315
00:23:01,626 --> 00:23:03,542
Sorry! Excuse me. Excuse me!

316
00:23:04,001 --> 00:23:04,751
Enough! Enough!

317
00:23:07,584 --> 00:23:10,376
Do you... do you see your dad?
How can I do business like this?

318
00:23:14,084 --> 00:23:14,876
Give it to him.

319
00:23:16,084 --> 00:23:17,334
He can drink however much he wants.

320
00:23:18,292 --> 00:23:19,792
He's had a lot today.

321
00:23:20,459 --> 00:23:21,251
Give it to him.

322
00:23:32,334 --> 00:23:34,292
It's about to rain.

323
00:23:35,042 --> 00:23:36,001
You can't blame me.

324
00:23:36,251 --> 00:23:37,126
Hey, man, I'm sorry.

325
00:23:38,334 --> 00:23:38,709
Sorry.

326
00:23:41,209 --> 00:23:41,917
Mom,

327
00:23:42,834 --> 00:23:44,667
before I was born,

328
00:23:44,959 --> 00:23:46,334
did you know I would have this disease?

329
00:23:49,501 --> 00:23:50,876
Has someone been telling you things?

330
00:23:51,834 --> 00:23:52,584
No...

331
00:23:52,876 --> 00:23:55,417
I was just thinking, you don't talk about dad much.

332
00:23:56,292 --> 00:23:58,292
I wonder if he had the same disease.

333
00:24:03,876 --> 00:24:04,667
Shiqiao,

334
00:24:06,209 --> 00:24:07,334
you're grown up now,

335
00:24:07,917 --> 00:24:12,376
and I think you're old enough
to understand some things.

336
00:24:15,084 --> 00:24:18,459
Your father was... different from ordinary people.

337
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:22,001
He was an alien.

338
00:24:31,626 --> 00:24:33,459
You believed it!

339
00:24:35,834 --> 00:24:36,542
Boring

340
00:24:37,459 --> 00:24:38,167
Really!

341
00:24:38,501 --> 00:24:39,501
At least...

342
00:24:40,584 --> 00:24:41,292
three seconds.

343
00:24:41,584 --> 00:24:42,417
I did not!

344
00:24:51,917 --> 00:24:52,626
Shiqiao,

345
00:24:53,126 --> 00:24:53,876
look.

346
00:24:54,459 --> 00:24:56,459
Do you see the brightest one up there?

347
00:24:57,751 --> 00:24:58,834
That's where your dad is.

348
00:24:59,917 --> 00:25:00,751
You're lying.

349
00:25:02,126 --> 00:25:03,042
Believe it or not

350
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:45,667
Leave it

351
00:25:46,917 --> 00:25:47,751
Come talk to me.

352
00:25:50,709 --> 00:25:51,501
What's wrong?

353
00:25:52,334 --> 00:25:53,209
You in a bad mood?

354
00:25:56,167 --> 00:25:56,959
A little bit.

355
00:25:58,959 --> 00:25:59,876
Let's play a game.

356
00:26:00,501 --> 00:26:02,001
I play this a lot with my mom.

357
00:26:02,459 --> 00:26:05,167
We'll each tell a joke,
and whoever doesn't laugh wins.

358
00:26:05,834 --> 00:26:06,584
I'll go first.

359
00:26:07,667 --> 00:26:11,417
A teacher told her students
to use "though" in a sentence.

360
00:26:11,917 --> 00:26:13,292
One of them stood up, and said,

361
00:26:13,876 --> 00:26:16,959
"A train came chugging out of a tunnel
in the mountains,

362
00:26:17,417 --> 00:26:20,126
'THOUGH-though-THOUGH-though-THOUGH-though'."

363
00:26:29,834 --> 00:26:31,959
I have a show in a few days. Will you come see it?

364
00:26:43,251 --> 00:26:45,709
"Your face with your fake smile plastered on

365
00:26:45,917 --> 00:26:49,126
bugs me in a way I can't quite say

366
00:26:49,417 --> 00:26:52,251
You're so careful when you kiss those asses,

367
00:26:52,417 --> 00:26:55,792
I bet you owe him more than you could ever repay

368
00:26:56,084 --> 00:27:01,751
I guess I'd rather not spend my life
on eggshells...

369
00:27:02,001 --> 00:27:04,626
Get drunk on it with me..."

370
00:27:05,251 --> 00:27:07,542
Even though this wild youth of yours

371
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:09,501
is strange to me,

372
00:27:10,501 --> 00:27:13,334
at that moment, the noise and the chaos moved me.

373
00:27:15,042 --> 00:27:17,667
That's because of you, Gong Ning.

374
00:27:19,292 --> 00:27:21,709
It's because this wild youth of yours

375
00:27:23,501 --> 00:27:25,251
is exactly what I imagined it would be.

376
00:27:25,667 --> 00:27:27,042
"I'm a rock and roll man!

377
00:27:28,501 --> 00:27:30,251
I'm a rock and roll man!

378
00:27:31,459 --> 00:27:33,417
I'm a rock and roll man!"

379
00:27:45,626 --> 00:27:47,001
If you think it's too loud,
you can wait for me outside.

380
00:27:47,542 --> 00:27:48,959
I'm gonna go pack up. I'll be right back.

381
00:27:49,126 --> 00:27:49,709
Ok.

382
00:29:09,376 --> 00:29:09,959
Hey.

383
00:29:19,376 --> 00:29:20,501
Do you have class this afternoon?

384
00:29:24,251 --> 00:29:26,334
You eat, I'll tell you a joke first.

385
00:29:27,959 --> 00:29:30,542
A long time ago, there was a cold-blooded assassin.

386
00:29:30,959 --> 00:29:33,334
His sword was cold, his hands were cold.

387
00:29:33,626 --> 00:29:35,001
His blood was cold.

388
00:29:35,334 --> 00:29:36,584
And in the end, he froze to death.

389
00:29:40,167 --> 00:29:41,251
Knock it off. Give it here.

390
00:29:45,084 --> 00:29:46,251
I didn't laugh, you lose.

391
00:29:55,542 --> 00:29:57,084
Why didn't you come that night?

392
00:29:58,959 --> 00:30:00,417
I met a friend backstage.

393
00:30:00,667 --> 00:30:02,459
We started drinking, then we got in a fight.

394
00:30:04,459 --> 00:30:06,251
Next time you want to apologize, don't explain.

395
00:30:06,542 --> 00:30:08,417
And if you want to explain, find a better excuse.

396
00:30:36,834 --> 00:30:40,542
"When the night has come

397
00:30:42,167 --> 00:30:44,709
And the land is dark

398
00:30:44,876 --> 00:30:50,751
And the moon is the only light we'll see

399
00:30:52,834 --> 00:30:56,959
No I won't be afraid

400
00:30:58,251 --> 00:31:00,626
No I won't be afraid

401
00:31:00,834 --> 00:31:07,334
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

402
00:31:23,376 --> 00:31:28,501
Oh darling, darling, stand by me

403
00:31:30,292 --> 00:31:34,042
Oh now stand by me

404
00:31:34,959 --> 00:31:39,709
Stand by me... stand by me..."

405
00:31:56,376 --> 00:31:58,876
(SW93hiqi8O, I'm sorry!)

406
00:32:13,501 --> 00:32:14,209
Yang Bilin...

407
00:32:14,459 --> 00:32:14,959
Present.

408
00:32:16,292 --> 00:32:16,876
Yang Dan...

409
00:32:17,167 --> 00:32:17,792
Present.

410
00:32:18,542 --> 00:32:19,459
Song Shiqiao...

411
00:32:21,584 --> 00:32:22,542
Song Shiqiao...

412
00:32:24,251 --> 00:32:25,876
This is the first time I've ever skipped class.

413
00:32:26,209 --> 00:32:28,251
If my mom finds out, I don't want to think
about the consequences.

414
00:32:28,709 --> 00:32:30,792
Don't worry. I promise it'll be worth it.

415
00:32:31,292 --> 00:32:31,792
Climb on.

416
00:32:33,167 --> 00:32:33,876
Come on!

417
00:32:35,501 --> 00:32:36,626
You wanted to know what running felt like, right?

418
00:32:36,959 --> 00:32:38,584
Well, you can borrow my legs to find out.

419
00:32:39,084 --> 00:32:39,667
Go!

420
00:32:40,251 --> 00:32:40,834
Hold on!

421
00:32:51,709 --> 00:32:53,626
A bumpy ride at moderate speed

422
00:32:54,001 --> 00:32:55,626
Running pretty much feels like this.

423
00:33:00,334 --> 00:33:02,126
No. 12, Nanjing Road!

424
00:33:12,501 --> 00:33:14,542
No. 17, Huaxin Road!

425
00:33:21,667 --> 00:33:24,001
No.24, Beach!

426
00:33:31,834 --> 00:33:34,626
No.31, Huimin Road! Forward!

427
00:34:03,334 --> 00:34:04,876
It seems like someone's about to have a birthday.

428
00:34:05,459 --> 00:34:07,042
Right. 23.

429
00:34:08,167 --> 00:34:09,042
Got a wish?

430
00:34:17,126 --> 00:34:17,834
Dancing?

431
00:34:18,959 --> 00:34:21,667
I picked this up from the side of the road
when I was a kid.

432
00:34:22,584 --> 00:34:23,876
I thought,

433
00:34:24,417 --> 00:34:26,542
maybe one day, I could be like her.

434
00:34:27,792 --> 00:34:29,084
What I forgot

435
00:34:30,542 --> 00:34:32,376
is that she's healthy.

436
00:34:32,834 --> 00:34:35,584
That's something I won't ever have.

437
00:34:37,459 --> 00:34:38,876
So I admire you.

438
00:34:39,292 --> 00:34:43,042
You can get up on stage and scream
and squander your youth.

439
00:35:02,584 --> 00:35:03,417
Mom...

440
00:35:04,459 --> 00:35:05,959
You look like something's bugging you.

441
00:35:07,167 --> 00:35:08,084
No, nothing.

442
00:35:10,751 --> 00:35:13,792
This is the first time you're not spending
your birthday with me.

443
00:35:16,001 --> 00:35:17,459
You've been doing it for 20 years.

444
00:35:17,834 --> 00:35:19,209
You deserve a break.

445
00:35:21,626 --> 00:35:22,292
Come here.

446
00:35:25,709 --> 00:35:26,959
Happy birthday, honey.

447
00:36:34,959 --> 00:36:36,167
Let's go! Come home with me!

448
00:36:36,459 --> 00:36:37,792
Hands off!

449
00:36:38,376 --> 00:36:39,834
Come home with me!

450
00:36:40,084 --> 00:36:41,501
Leave me alone.

451
00:36:42,042 --> 00:36:44,376
- Come home with me. - I don't want to

452
00:37:25,084 --> 00:37:26,292
You're not a fish,

453
00:37:27,167 --> 00:37:28,584
so why aren't you asleep?

454
00:38:08,292 --> 00:38:09,667
I'm sorry about your birthday.

455
00:38:10,917 --> 00:38:12,084
Something bad happened.

456
00:38:15,292 --> 00:38:16,084
We should separate.

457
00:38:19,001 --> 00:38:20,876
I guess something bad is happening to me today.

458
00:38:24,584 --> 00:38:25,751
There's a side of my life

459
00:38:26,876 --> 00:38:28,084
that's very messy.

460
00:38:29,417 --> 00:38:30,084
I know.

461
00:38:31,542 --> 00:38:33,084
I admit I've hidden things from you.

462
00:38:34,417 --> 00:38:36,042
Then you can tell me now.

463
00:38:37,792 --> 00:38:39,334
There's a lot I can't explain right now.

464
00:38:40,459 --> 00:38:41,709
But in a while you'll understand.

465
00:38:43,084 --> 00:38:45,626
That doesn't sound like something
Gong Ning would say.

466
00:39:18,209 --> 00:39:19,084
As of this moment,

467
00:39:19,709 --> 00:39:21,001
our contract is over.

468
00:39:40,834 --> 00:39:42,584
I don't know much about psychology,

469
00:39:43,126 --> 00:39:44,751
but I think I should warn you

470
00:39:45,501 --> 00:39:47,542
that if you keep listening
to your daughter's recordings,

471
00:39:47,917 --> 00:39:49,042
and she finds out,

472
00:39:49,292 --> 00:39:52,001
she'll be scarred in a way
that will be very hard to undo.

473
00:39:53,292 --> 00:39:55,334
I just think, if she spends too long in this state,

474
00:39:55,751 --> 00:39:56,292
she'll end up

475
00:39:56,542 --> 00:39:58,751
with a very unhealthy mindset later in life.

476
00:40:00,292 --> 00:40:02,751
That won't necessarily happen.

477
00:40:03,001 --> 00:40:05,126
For her, this might just be the way
she wants to live her life.

478
00:40:07,001 --> 00:40:08,001
I have an idea.

479
00:40:19,501 --> 00:40:21,876
A pair of hands beyond repair and beautification,

480
00:40:22,209 --> 00:40:24,376
Warmth is always behind,

481
00:40:24,709 --> 00:40:28,459
She's always caring, and now you feel guilty
for not appreciating it.

482
00:40:29,126 --> 00:40:32,001
She doesn't like the music you drown yourself in.

483
00:40:32,251 --> 00:40:34,751
A mother's love never lets up

484
00:40:35,126 --> 00:40:38,542
You can try to be happy,
but you have to pay it back.

485
00:40:41,459 --> 00:40:42,959
So you just say you want to leave, and you go?

486
00:40:44,542 --> 00:40:46,209
I told you a long time ago I wanted to go abroad.

487
00:40:46,959 --> 00:40:48,042
You never took it seriously.

488
00:40:48,376 --> 00:40:51,959
Go abroad... since when do I have the money
to go abroad?

489
00:40:52,334 --> 00:40:54,584
If you don't have money, you can work for it!
You can get a job!

490
00:41:00,084 --> 00:41:01,584
Music is my job.

491
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:03,209
Forget it. Making music is dead end.

492
00:41:03,501 --> 00:41:04,876
The only person who encourages
and supports your music

493
00:41:06,542 --> 00:41:07,376
Is no longer here.

494
00:41:16,167 --> 00:41:17,334
Peng Wei, you changed.

495
00:41:18,459 --> 00:41:19,501
Maybe you should change!

496
00:41:20,334 --> 00:41:21,792
Ever since your mom died you've been

497
00:41:22,084 --> 00:41:22,917
spinning your wheels in the same rut!

498
00:41:24,209 --> 00:41:26,751
Maybe I like spinning my wheels.

499
00:41:42,126 --> 00:41:45,959
"You finally ran away,

500
00:41:46,209 --> 00:41:49,876
disappeared before my eyes

501
00:41:50,459 --> 00:41:54,167
You want me to be better to you,

502
00:41:54,584 --> 00:41:58,792
You think you're the one who needs pity

503
00:41:59,001 --> 00:42:02,584
Shut that mouth

504
00:42:02,792 --> 00:42:06,876
You're polluting the world with your complaints

505
00:42:07,334 --> 00:42:11,042
Pack up your hypocrisy..."

506
00:42:12,792 --> 00:42:13,709
stop, stop, stop!

507
00:42:16,542 --> 00:42:17,209
Hey!

508
00:42:18,001 --> 00:42:18,876
I'm talking about you guys!

509
00:42:21,209 --> 00:42:22,584
Can you keep it down?

510
00:42:24,251 --> 00:42:26,042
W-w-what are you gonna do about it?

511
00:42:26,959 --> 00:42:28,167
You're making it hard to sing.

512
00:42:30,417 --> 00:42:33,959
Well m-m-maybe, if you sang j-j-just
a little bit better,

513
00:42:35,459 --> 00:42:39,626
j-j-just a little, teensy, tiny b-b-bit,

514
00:42:39,959 --> 00:42:44,501
we wouldn't make any noise! Right? Right!

515
00:43:08,084 --> 00:43:09,417
I said don't fight them.

516
00:43:09,792 --> 00:43:10,792
You already wrecked the guitar!

517
00:43:11,417 --> 00:43:12,167
Which one of you is Lv Xia?

518
00:43:13,292 --> 00:43:14,084
Sign this.

519
00:43:17,167 --> 00:43:17,959
This is for you.

520
00:43:20,001 --> 00:43:21,292
(Lv Xia, your situation with the police
is taken care of.

521
00:43:21,626 --> 00:43:23,084
I want to discuss something with you.)

522
00:43:23,542 --> 00:43:24,751
(Zheng Qing)

523
00:43:44,334 --> 00:43:44,834
Sit down.

524
00:43:49,084 --> 00:43:50,626
You paid my fine and medical bills?

525
00:43:52,084 --> 00:43:53,292
And for the damage to the bar.

526
00:43:53,709 --> 00:43:54,501
Why?

527
00:43:55,001 --> 00:43:56,209
I want you to work for me.

528
00:43:56,709 --> 00:43:58,667
I want you to play a role for my daughter.

529
00:43:59,251 --> 00:44:01,084
Listen, lady, I'm not an actor.

530
00:44:01,501 --> 00:44:02,459
I'm not looking for an actor.

531
00:44:02,959 --> 00:44:03,917
Then what's the role?

532
00:44:07,584 --> 00:44:08,459
On the 19th

533
00:44:08,834 --> 00:44:09,876
10100 P.M.

534
00:44:11,084 --> 00:44:14,501
Gong Ning, you suddenly disappeared from my life,

535
00:44:15,292 --> 00:44:18,167
and even after so long, I'm still not used to it.

536
00:44:19,584 --> 00:44:21,584
I want to take my memories of you

537
00:44:21,834 --> 00:44:23,209
and draw them into a comic.

538
00:44:24,459 --> 00:44:27,126
But my hands aren't up to it.

539
00:44:27,792 --> 00:44:30,209
I pick up a pen to draw you,
and I always end up putting it down.

540
00:44:31,376 --> 00:44:33,667
So I decided to take those memories
and tape them.

541
00:44:34,042 --> 00:44:36,084
I guess this is how I'll have to remember you.

542
00:44:37,376 --> 00:44:40,167
Do you remember that basketball court surrounded
by a chain-link fence?

543
00:44:41,084 --> 00:44:44,459
I used to sit on the bench by the tree

544
00:44:45,042 --> 00:44:46,376
and hold a book over my face, pretending to read,

545
00:44:47,084 --> 00:44:50,501
and I'd watch you,
running and jumping on the court.

546
00:44:52,251 --> 00:44:53,376
I remember watching you

547
00:44:53,834 --> 00:44:56,834
in the classroom while you gave yourself
headaches over math problems

548
00:44:57,292 --> 00:44:59,292
While I was at dance practice, I used to

549
00:44:59,501 --> 00:45:01,584
songs on your guitar over and over,

550
00:45:02,167 --> 00:45:04,417
and then I'd sneak a bottle of water
with a smiley face on it

551
00:45:04,667 --> 00:45:06,001
into your guitar case.

552
00:45:09,251 --> 00:45:10,417
I'm sure you never realized

553
00:45:11,084 --> 00:45:13,417
that when you couldn't find your bike keys,

554
00:45:14,167 --> 00:45:16,542
I was watching you, laughing.

555
00:45:17,459 --> 00:45:20,459
It was so cute how frantic you used to get.

556
00:45:27,542 --> 00:45:28,667
His name was Gong Ning.

557
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:30,126
He went to high school with my daughter.

558
00:45:32,167 --> 00:45:32,876
What do you want from me?

559
00:45:34,376 --> 00:45:37,126
I've been watching a lot of bands.

560
00:45:37,584 --> 00:45:39,792
In terms of age and personality,
you're a lot like him.

561
00:45:40,626 --> 00:45:43,042
Our guitarist, Chunzi.
He calls himself "gregarious".

562
00:45:43,292 --> 00:45:44,084
I'm very pleased to meet you, ma'am.

563
00:45:47,417 --> 00:45:48,001
Guqi, our keyboardist.

564
00:45:48,376 --> 00:45:50,334
She collects vintage cameras.

565
00:45:50,751 --> 00:45:51,876
We call her "Nick Funry".

566
00:45:52,459 --> 00:45:55,709
Liang Liang, our bassist.
He calls himself "second-generation rich."

567
00:45:56,001 --> 00:45:56,834
I am in spirit.

568
00:45:58,542 --> 00:45:59,376
Meng Dong, our drummer.

569
00:45:59,834 --> 00:46:00,917
I already knew that.

570
00:46:01,917 --> 00:46:04,834
You throw the drumsticks off the stage
after every show.

571
00:46:05,042 --> 00:46:06,959
Off the stage after ever show.

572
00:46:07,959 --> 00:46:09,667
Which is why we call him "the Groupie Magnet".

573
00:46:10,001 --> 00:46:11,751
Don't listen to them.

574
00:46:12,042 --> 00:46:13,334
I just like to make new friends.

575
00:46:17,501 --> 00:46:18,584
My girlfriend, Peng Wei.

576
00:46:19,751 --> 00:46:20,459
We're about to split up.

577
00:46:26,751 --> 00:46:27,542
That's my dad.

578
00:46:28,501 --> 00:46:31,376
No I'm not. But the job's open.

579
00:46:35,917 --> 00:46:40,584
In... the future, I'd like you all to call him
Gong Ning around my daughter.

580
00:46:43,126 --> 00:46:44,001
Thank you, everyone.

581
00:46:52,792 --> 00:46:53,959
So what do you want me to do, exactly?

582
00:46:55,001 --> 00:46:57,709
Make my daughter fall in love with Gong Ning.

583
00:47:00,959 --> 00:47:01,876
Are you Song Shiqiao?

584
00:47:03,709 --> 00:47:04,376
I'm Gong Ning.

585
00:47:05,334 --> 00:47:06,959
No matter how close we are, we're not twins.

586
00:47:07,292 --> 00:47:08,542
How could she not be able to tell the difference?

587
00:47:09,042 --> 00:47:10,126
Unless there's something wrong with her head?

588
00:47:13,751 --> 00:47:14,751
You've changed a lot.

589
00:47:15,626 --> 00:47:16,876
I didn't recognize you at all.

590
00:47:17,417 --> 00:47:20,126
She's perfectly intelligent,
she just has some problems with her memory.

591
00:47:20,917 --> 00:47:22,042
It's bad enough that you brought it,

592
00:47:22,376 --> 00:47:24,459
but why did you let the chicken out of the bag?

593
00:47:25,167 --> 00:47:26,417
My park is full of kids!

594
00:47:27,084 --> 00:47:28,001
Guess who pays if someone gets hurt?!

595
00:47:28,334 --> 00:47:29,001
Is she still looking?

596
00:47:29,917 --> 00:47:30,542
Don't turn around.

597
00:47:31,542 --> 00:47:32,209
Yeah.

598
00:47:34,834 --> 00:47:38,376
My daughter has a genetic disorder. She takes pills.

599
00:47:39,334 --> 00:47:41,667
And those pills cause significant memory loss.

600
00:47:41,876 --> 00:47:45,626
Mom, is this medicine making me stupid?

601
00:47:46,584 --> 00:47:47,501
Why would it?

602
00:47:48,376 --> 00:47:49,292
So he was in a band?

603
00:47:49,917 --> 00:47:51,626
And he was a really good guitar player.

604
00:47:52,292 --> 00:47:54,376
Our music teacher couldn't shut up about him.

605
00:47:55,042 --> 00:47:57,667
If he were still alive, he probably would be.

606
00:47:58,542 --> 00:47:59,251
He's dead?

607
00:48:00,251 --> 00:48:00,917
Car accident.

608
00:48:03,084 --> 00:48:04,292
But my daughter doesn't know.

609
00:48:04,667 --> 00:48:07,042
The school thought the news would
affect the other students,

610
00:48:07,251 --> 00:48:09,126
so they told his classmates
he transferred to another school.

611
00:48:09,376 --> 00:48:10,667
But we all know the real reason

612
00:48:11,001 --> 00:48:12,042
why he left.

613
00:48:14,334 --> 00:48:15,167
And what's that?

614
00:48:16,251 --> 00:48:17,876
He beat up the principal's son,

615
00:48:18,126 --> 00:48:20,042
so they had him expelled, and then lied about it.

616
00:48:20,834 --> 00:48:22,792
Hey, hey! Get back here!

617
00:48:23,292 --> 00:48:25,042
All you ever do is cause me problems!

618
00:48:26,376 --> 00:48:28,959
I told you to stay in the bag, remember?

619
00:48:29,376 --> 00:48:31,001
So how'd you pull it off?

620
00:48:31,251 --> 00:48:32,876
I listened to all her tapes,

621
00:48:33,126 --> 00:48:34,626
and I remembered that story about the hiccups.

622
00:48:35,084 --> 00:48:36,042
Anxiety-induced diaphragma,

623
00:48:36,251 --> 00:48:38,709
hiccups caused by a nervous or excited state.

624
00:48:43,626 --> 00:48:46,417
Hey, can you not with the silent treatment?
Lighten up, alright?

625
00:48:46,709 --> 00:48:49,417
So what, you're proud of lying to a girl for money?

626
00:48:52,167 --> 00:48:54,542
She has more than 300 tapes like this.

627
00:48:54,834 --> 00:48:56,959
You know, erotic psychosis,
in this day and age, that's something.

628
00:48:57,292 --> 00:48:58,834
I'll pay back the money you spent on me.

629
00:48:59,334 --> 00:49:00,209
I can't do this.

630
00:49:00,959 --> 00:49:02,584
How much do you make for a show?

631
00:49:03,292 --> 00:49:04,292
Could you pay me back?

632
00:49:05,167 --> 00:49:06,001
That...

633
00:49:06,209 --> 00:49:09,001
That gesture, that's what made me decide to ask you.

634
00:49:14,376 --> 00:49:17,376
My daughter said Gong Ning
used to scratch his head like that.

635
00:49:18,876 --> 00:49:19,959
I'll buy you an MP3 player.

636
00:49:21,209 --> 00:49:23,001
They're small, light, and they can record, too.

637
00:49:24,584 --> 00:49:25,751
I still like tapes.

638
00:49:26,917 --> 00:49:28,209
Because they remind you...

639
00:49:30,959 --> 00:49:32,209
of the passage of time.

640
00:49:36,667 --> 00:49:37,417
This is my deposit.

641
00:49:38,042 --> 00:49:39,626
If you agree, we'll sign this contract,

642
00:49:40,042 --> 00:49:41,251
and I'll tell you the PIN.

643
00:49:44,417 --> 00:49:46,126
But I'm going to say this before we start,

644
00:49:47,001 --> 00:49:48,876
this isn't you doing me a favor, this is work.

645
00:50:14,001 --> 00:50:14,876
This is your shop?

646
00:50:18,001 --> 00:50:18,917
You must have a lot of money.

647
00:50:20,792 --> 00:50:22,001
I just love my daughter a lot.

648
00:50:28,667 --> 00:50:30,001
I think it's about to rain soon.

649
00:50:30,834 --> 00:50:31,917
Come on, there's a place I want to show you.

650
00:50:32,917 --> 00:50:33,751
Where?

651
00:50:34,084 --> 00:50:34,792
Come with me.

652
00:50:36,292 --> 00:50:37,126
"AH LEI: This is urgent!"

653
00:50:38,084 --> 00:50:39,834
Stop drinking, Sir.

654
00:50:40,334 --> 00:50:41,126
Excuse me.

655
00:50:41,667 --> 00:50:42,542
Stop drinking.

656
00:50:43,251 --> 00:50:43,959
Enough.

657
00:50:48,792 --> 00:50:49,626
Give it to him.

658
00:50:53,376 --> 00:50:54,417
Actually... I can't today.

659
00:50:58,417 --> 00:51:01,334
It's about to rain.

660
00:51:04,126 --> 00:51:05,042
There's something I have to go do.

661
00:51:08,042 --> 00:51:09,001
Then give me your key.

662
00:51:17,334 --> 00:51:18,917
Don't lose me again!

663
00:51:32,167 --> 00:51:35,001
This is my 81st time passing this intersection
in the rain.

664
00:51:36,376 --> 00:51:37,959
The man who directs traffic

665
00:51:38,209 --> 00:51:39,876
is still here, right on time

666
00:51:41,542 --> 00:51:43,792
He has a very moving story,

667
00:51:45,334 --> 00:51:46,959
and I wanted to tell you today.

668
00:51:55,709 --> 00:51:56,459
Mom...

669
00:51:57,417 --> 00:51:58,584
I don't think I can hold on any more.

670
00:52:25,042 --> 00:52:25,834
Are you coming or not?

671
00:52:26,042 --> 00:52:27,542
No, Shiqiao is waiting for me.

672
00:52:27,917 --> 00:52:28,584
Let's go.

673
00:52:35,667 --> 00:52:36,417
Who's he?

674
00:52:37,542 --> 00:52:38,751
Lv Xia, we broke up.

675
00:52:39,084 --> 00:52:41,501
You're Lv Xia, right? Hi, I'm Li Rao.

676
00:52:42,542 --> 00:52:43,167
Who's he?

677
00:52:45,417 --> 00:52:46,126
I'm Li Rao.

678
00:52:46,292 --> 00:52:47,001
I didn't ask you!

679
00:52:48,167 --> 00:52:48,917
Who's he?

680
00:52:52,584 --> 00:52:53,959
I told you, my name is Li Rao!

681
00:52:55,292 --> 00:52:56,209
Stop fighting, Lv Xia.

682
00:52:56,417 --> 00:52:57,376
Don't hit him! Lv Xia!

683
00:53:17,167 --> 00:53:17,917
Take a look.

684
00:53:18,959 --> 00:53:20,959
You violated section 4, clause 3,

685
00:53:21,667 --> 00:53:23,167
and the contract outlines the penalties for that.

686
00:53:23,792 --> 00:53:26,167
Fine, dock my salary.

687
00:53:28,126 --> 00:53:31,209
You left my daughter in the street
for three hours yesterday!

688
00:53:32,126 --> 00:53:34,042
And today you're acting like it doesn't matter?!

689
00:53:34,209 --> 00:53:35,084
Ma'am!

690
00:53:36,334 --> 00:53:37,959
It's not like I do this every day.

691
00:53:38,334 --> 00:53:39,209
It was a coincidence, alright?

692
00:53:39,834 --> 00:53:43,084
Remember, this is work, understand?

693
00:53:43,876 --> 00:53:44,626
L9e'I you!

694
00:53:46,126 --> 00:53:47,584
I made the mess and I'll clean it up.

695
00:53:49,584 --> 00:53:51,084
Don't think she's that easy to console.

696
00:53:53,042 --> 00:53:55,084
Anybody I want to console gets consoled, alright?

697
00:53:56,459 --> 00:53:57,917
Next time you want to apologize, don't explain.

698
00:53:58,167 --> 00:53:59,834
And if you want to explain, find a better excuse.

699
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:15,792
(SW93hiqi8O, I'm sorry!)

700
00:54:40,542 --> 00:54:41,167
Gong Ning,

701
00:54:41,584 --> 00:54:43,126
It's my 18th birthday today,

702
00:54:43,959 --> 00:54:46,917
and I just secretly made a very unrealistic wish.

703
00:54:47,709 --> 00:54:50,876
I wished that someday, you'd suddenly appear

704
00:54:51,251 --> 00:54:53,084
with your guitar and sing a song just for me.

705
00:54:53,709 --> 00:54:57,542
I don't think words could describe
how happy that would make me.

706
00:54:59,292 --> 00:55:00,459
And that's how,

707
00:55:00,709 --> 00:55:02,334
when I least expected it, my wish came true.

708
00:55:03,709 --> 00:55:04,542
All these years,

709
00:55:05,167 --> 00:55:06,917
you've been speaking into that tape recorder?

710
00:55:07,667 --> 00:55:08,626
Is it stupid?

711
00:55:09,251 --> 00:55:10,001
Yeah!

712
00:55:11,084 --> 00:55:11,834
I know...

713
00:55:14,501 --> 00:55:15,667
So why do you only record side A?

714
00:55:17,209 --> 00:55:18,667
Because I leave side B for you to fill.

715
00:55:20,376 --> 00:55:21,084
I...

716
00:55:23,501 --> 00:55:24,542
Oh, don't be so serious!

717
00:55:25,667 --> 00:55:27,042
Every day around this time

718
00:55:27,334 --> 00:55:28,251
I start saying crazy things.

719
00:55:29,001 --> 00:55:30,417
It's probably the medicine wearing off.

720
00:55:48,167 --> 00:55:49,209
Don't be so serious.

721
00:55:54,209 --> 00:55:54,917
Are you scared?

722
00:55:56,459 --> 00:55:57,167
Of what?

723
00:55:59,834 --> 00:56:01,001
The passage of time.

724
00:56:09,209 --> 00:56:10,167
I want you to be my girlfriend.

725
00:56:17,334 --> 00:56:18,542
What kind of candy do you like?

726
00:56:22,626 --> 00:56:24,834
Apple, Orange, or Peach?

727
00:56:26,126 --> 00:56:26,917
Orange.

728
00:56:37,959 --> 00:56:39,709
It'll help you remember this moment.

729
00:56:44,542 --> 00:56:46,334
The moment we became a couple.

730
00:57:14,292 --> 00:57:15,251
Mom!

731
00:57:17,376 --> 00:57:20,167
Know why the English word for blue is "blue"?

732
00:57:20,792 --> 00:57:22,542
Because when fish exhale, they go

733
00:57:22,751 --> 00:57:24,209
"Blue blue blue"!

734
00:57:24,626 --> 00:57:25,959
Ok, getting dizzy now!

735
00:57:31,209 --> 00:57:32,001
Blue!

736
00:57:44,084 --> 00:57:44,792
What's wrong now?

737
00:57:45,292 --> 00:57:46,417
What did you do to my daughter?

738
00:57:47,126 --> 00:57:48,376
She was acting crazy when she got home today!

739
00:57:49,167 --> 00:57:50,542
You told me to formalize the relationship.

740
00:57:51,792 --> 00:57:52,792
I just kissed her.

741
00:57:54,792 --> 00:57:57,417
You... who the hell do you think you are!

742
00:57:59,751 --> 00:58:01,751
If my heart's not in it,
you say I'm being unprofessional.

743
00:58:02,209 --> 00:58:03,792
If I play the role, I'm overstepping.

744
00:58:04,292 --> 00:58:05,292
You're not making this easy for me.

745
00:58:06,792 --> 00:58:09,042
I didn't ask you to be extreme about it!

746
00:58:12,251 --> 00:58:13,001
What are you running from?

747
00:58:16,917 --> 00:58:17,751
Take this, it's a script.

748
00:58:18,334 --> 00:58:18,959
Learn your lines.

749
00:58:21,792 --> 00:58:25,084
"If you want to know what running feels like,
you can borrow my legs."

750
00:58:25,417 --> 00:58:26,167
This is lame.

751
00:58:26,376 --> 00:58:27,084
Cut the crap.

752
00:58:27,876 --> 00:58:29,501
You kiss my daughter,
and you're afraid this is lame.

753
00:58:29,917 --> 00:58:31,584
I'm just trying to make it realistic, alright?

754
00:58:47,459 --> 00:58:48,292
When people finally decide

755
00:58:48,792 --> 00:58:50,459
to jump into the river of love,

756
00:58:50,917 --> 00:58:52,584
do you know what the last expression
on their faces is?

757
00:58:59,084 --> 00:59:00,709
He won't actually fall for her, right?

758
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:08,417
I remember you studied dance in high school.

759
00:59:11,626 --> 00:59:12,834
But after I graduated,

760
00:59:13,584 --> 00:59:15,126
I collapsed at a rehearsal.

761
00:59:15,751 --> 00:59:17,417
My mom didn't let me dance after that.

762
00:59:18,126 --> 00:59:19,459
If you had the chance,

763
00:59:20,584 --> 00:59:21,459
what would you choose?

764
00:59:23,084 --> 00:59:24,292
I'd get back on stage without hesitating.

765
00:59:26,459 --> 00:59:28,292
But your mom said that could kill you.

766
00:59:33,417 --> 00:59:36,001
But everyone wants to shine,
just once, in their lifetime.

767
00:59:36,417 --> 00:59:36,876
Don't they?

768
00:59:40,792 --> 00:59:42,417
This isn't something you should think about.

769
00:59:47,501 --> 00:59:48,042
Thanks.

770
00:59:53,001 --> 00:59:53,709
Hello?

771
00:59:54,667 --> 00:59:55,709
Get down here and get your dad under control!

772
00:59:56,042 --> 00:59:56,751
There is a construction going on.

773
00:59:57,001 --> 00:59:58,042
He insists to direct traffic
in the middle of the road. Sorry.

774
00:59:58,209 --> 00:59:59,042
Sorry.

775
00:59:59,709 --> 01:00:00,417
Go away.

776
01:00:01,209 --> 01:00:02,042
Go away.

777
01:00:02,792 --> 01:00:04,084
There is a construction going on.

778
01:00:04,584 --> 01:00:06,751
They can do their job, and I'll direct traffic.

779
01:00:07,001 --> 01:00:08,167
I am not in the way.

780
01:00:08,376 --> 01:00:10,792
What does this role you play accomplish?

781
01:00:11,126 --> 01:00:12,292
Mom is gone!

782
01:00:15,751 --> 01:00:18,876
Who says she's gone? She's right here!

783
01:00:19,876 --> 01:00:20,834
She is always here.

784
01:00:21,126 --> 01:00:22,126
She's dead!

785
01:00:22,376 --> 01:00:23,751
She's not here! She's in an urn!

786
01:00:23,959 --> 01:00:24,667
What are you saying?

787
01:00:36,876 --> 01:00:39,334
You think getting drunk every day is missing her.

788
01:00:41,876 --> 01:00:44,209
You think directing traffic is honoring her memory.

789
01:00:46,501 --> 01:00:49,667
You spend every single day
lost in your own fantasies!

790
01:00:51,376 --> 01:00:53,001
Have you ever thought about me?

791
01:00:55,501 --> 01:00:57,501
When she died, it hurt me too!

792
01:01:01,876 --> 01:01:05,167
And what do you do? Over and over again,
you poke at my wounds!

793
01:01:07,126 --> 01:01:08,792
It's been four years,

794
01:01:10,126 --> 01:01:12,417
but every morning, I wake up,
and it feels like she left yesterday.

795
01:01:13,667 --> 01:01:15,334
Every time I decide to pick myself up,

796
01:01:16,084 --> 01:01:17,917
every time I want to walk out of that shadow,

797
01:01:18,209 --> 01:01:20,209
you beat me right back!

798
01:01:27,667 --> 01:01:30,042
Do you think she'd want to see you like this?

799
01:01:31,542 --> 01:01:32,959
Do you think she'd want to see you
drop out of college?

800
01:01:34,251 --> 01:01:35,542
They're two separate things!

801
01:01:35,792 --> 01:01:37,292
Then take care of the one that's yours!

802
01:01:39,126 --> 01:01:40,167
Come home with me.

803
01:01:41,001 --> 01:01:43,334
Leave me alone!

804
01:01:45,417 --> 01:01:46,959
Come home with me.

805
01:02:15,626 --> 01:02:18,084
(SHIQIAO'S MOM calling...)

806
01:02:23,251 --> 01:02:25,042
Four years ago, on a rainy night,

807
01:02:25,417 --> 01:02:27,917
Lv Xia's mother died in a car
crash at that intersection.

808
01:02:28,542 --> 01:02:30,792
After that, his dad had a breakdown.

809
01:02:31,459 --> 01:02:33,667
He went from a taxi driver who didn't touch alcohol

810
01:02:33,959 --> 01:02:36,667
to a drunk scraping by on welfare.

811
01:02:38,584 --> 01:02:41,084
Lv Xia was actually really attached to her.

812
01:02:42,209 --> 01:02:44,209
When his dad wouldn't budge about it,

813
01:02:44,626 --> 01:02:46,626
his mom secretly allowed him to study music.

814
01:02:47,917 --> 01:02:48,709
So,

815
01:02:49,334 --> 01:02:50,417
after his mom died,

816
01:02:51,001 --> 01:02:53,667
he and his dad didn't have much to talk about.

817
01:02:55,001 --> 01:02:55,876
So that's his story.

818
01:02:57,417 --> 01:02:58,959
When he told my daughter

819
01:02:59,292 --> 01:03:00,542
his parents were on sabbatical abroad.

820
01:03:01,126 --> 01:03:03,376
I thought he was vain.

821
01:03:04,542 --> 01:03:05,709
You read him wrong.

822
01:03:06,459 --> 01:03:08,959
He really hates talking about his family
with other people,

823
01:03:09,292 --> 01:03:10,167
including us.

824
01:03:10,751 --> 01:03:13,167
We had to ask around to find out what we know.

825
01:03:13,667 --> 01:03:15,417
Do you remember the sweater he wears all the time?

826
01:03:16,292 --> 01:03:17,751
Ah Lei, the guy who owns the corner shop,

827
01:03:18,376 --> 01:03:21,167
said his mom got the collar fixed,
and she was on her way

828
01:03:21,459 --> 01:03:22,292
back from the tailor with it.

829
01:03:22,667 --> 01:03:24,126
The intersection, she just stopped walking.

830
01:03:24,584 --> 01:03:25,834
He doesn't know what she was thinking,
but when she got to

831
01:03:35,126 --> 01:03:36,584
I admit I've hidden things from you.

832
01:03:37,959 --> 01:03:39,001
We should separate.

833
01:03:40,167 --> 01:03:42,626
That doesn't sound like something
Gong Ning would say.

834
01:03:45,626 --> 01:03:46,417
Why?

835
01:03:50,501 --> 01:03:52,334
Gong Ning was honest, and he didn't give up.

836
01:03:53,042 --> 01:03:54,917
He didn't make excuses for himself.

837
01:03:57,167 --> 01:03:57,917
But I...

838
01:03:58,251 --> 01:04:00,417
How am I supposed to be exactly
the person you remember?

839
01:04:02,292 --> 01:04:04,209
Making excuses is better than lying, right?

840
01:04:04,751 --> 01:04:05,876
You've never told a lie?

841
01:04:09,167 --> 01:04:09,917
Gong Ning,

842
01:04:11,626 --> 01:04:13,751
what color is your father to you?

843
01:04:15,667 --> 01:04:16,542
What?

844
01:04:18,167 --> 01:04:20,459
Your father isn't a professor
on sabbatical abroad, is he?

845
01:04:58,959 --> 01:04:59,834
Gong Ning,

846
01:05:00,667 --> 01:05:02,376
this is the story I heard.

847
01:05:03,376 --> 01:05:04,792
A man's wife

848
01:05:05,751 --> 01:05:07,542
was hit by a car on a rainy day

849
01:05:08,792 --> 01:05:10,084
and died.

850
01:05:11,667 --> 01:05:12,459
After that,

851
01:05:13,501 --> 01:05:15,626
every time it rained, the man

852
01:05:16,459 --> 01:05:20,001
went to that intersection and directed traffic.

853
01:05:21,751 --> 01:05:24,376
It's a very moving story.

854
01:05:25,501 --> 01:05:26,334
But,

855
01:05:27,667 --> 01:05:29,376
I went to see that man today,

856
01:05:30,334 --> 01:05:32,167
and I told him another story.

857
01:05:35,126 --> 01:05:35,917
So,

858
01:05:36,334 --> 01:05:37,834
when I was 12,

859
01:05:38,792 --> 01:05:40,209
it started to dawn on me

860
01:05:41,251 --> 01:05:43,167
that I might have the same disease my father had.

861
01:05:44,459 --> 01:05:45,501
My mom said

862
01:05:46,251 --> 01:05:49,251
that since we can't change the way things are,

863
01:05:50,709 --> 01:05:53,417
the best we can do is change how we see things.

864
01:05:54,792 --> 01:05:56,834
People who always complain about
what's wrong with life

865
01:05:57,042 --> 01:05:58,959
never really find the beauty in it.

866
01:06:00,292 --> 01:06:03,084
Actually, the person I want to say
that to the most is Gong Ning.

867
01:06:06,042 --> 01:06:06,876
Gong Ning,

868
01:06:08,084 --> 01:06:09,626
the communication failures in the past

869
01:06:10,292 --> 01:06:12,917
might be because you haven't put on your raincoat

870
01:06:13,876 --> 01:06:15,709
and walked back into that unbearable memory,

871
01:06:16,626 --> 01:06:19,042
and found the root of your pain, and cut it out.

872
01:06:22,667 --> 01:06:23,376
Look,

873
01:06:24,334 --> 01:06:26,501
the only one who can save
Gong Ning from his darkness

874
01:06:27,084 --> 01:06:27,959
is you.

875
01:06:45,959 --> 01:06:50,042
"I forget how long it's been

876
01:06:51,334 --> 01:06:55,417
since I've forgotten your smile

877
01:06:57,751 --> 01:07:02,251
Where is the person who can brew the wine

878
01:07:03,251 --> 01:07:08,584
that can wash away your sadness?"

879
01:07:11,042 --> 01:07:11,709
Dad,

880
01:07:14,917 --> 01:07:16,126
let's stop this.

881
01:07:17,917 --> 01:07:19,876
Yeah. Let's stop.

882
01:07:26,501 --> 01:07:29,209
Son, I won't drink any more,

883
01:07:31,251 --> 01:07:34,042
but I'm going to guard this intersection
for the rest of my life.

884
01:07:36,084 --> 01:07:38,251
If no more accidents here,

885
01:07:40,084 --> 01:07:42,542
it means your mom died for something.

886
01:07:45,917 --> 01:07:50,376
"On this busy intersection,

887
01:07:51,751 --> 01:07:56,459
standing in the rain,

888
01:07:57,626 --> 01:08:02,917
we have to learn to let go

889
01:08:03,251 --> 01:08:09,542
But you still have me,

890
01:08:09,792 --> 01:08:14,626
so stop fighting with the past

891
01:08:15,209 --> 01:08:20,126
We're not enemies..."

892
01:08:47,376 --> 01:08:48,042
Gong Ning...

893
01:08:50,917 --> 01:08:52,084
I bought two cups.

894
01:08:52,751 --> 01:08:55,042
You use the big one, and I'll use the small one.

895
01:09:05,876 --> 01:09:07,459
I sewed this. Do you like it?

896
01:09:12,084 --> 01:09:12,792
Oh,

897
01:09:14,001 --> 01:09:15,501
and your old towel is too dirty.

898
01:09:15,751 --> 01:09:16,709
I made you two new ones.

899
01:09:23,709 --> 01:09:25,292
I didn't have enough time,

900
01:09:25,709 --> 01:09:27,542
so it might not look very good.

901
01:10:18,792 --> 01:10:20,209
(Turn off the light and go to the porch.)

902
01:11:11,126 --> 01:11:11,959
Gong Ning...

903
01:11:12,542 --> 01:11:14,334
I never thought, that the first time I saw snow,

904
01:11:15,084 --> 01:11:16,917
I wouldn't be cold,

905
01:11:18,459 --> 01:11:20,751
I'd be basking in the warmth you created.

906
01:11:22,209 --> 01:11:24,251
I bit my lip to stop myself from crying.

907
01:11:25,917 --> 01:11:30,084
I was afraid if I blurred my vision,
I wouldn't be able to see your face.

908
01:11:31,834 --> 01:11:36,459
I was afraid if my tears flowed,
I'd put out the tiny flame in my heart.

909
01:11:38,334 --> 01:11:40,751
I was afraid my happiness would vanish,

910
01:11:41,251 --> 01:11:42,792
that it would vanish with you.

911
01:11:44,334 --> 01:11:47,792
So I opened my eyes,
and I watched you as close as I could,

912
01:11:49,167 --> 01:11:50,084
because...

913
01:11:52,001 --> 01:11:52,959
I am also afraid that

914
01:11:53,792 --> 01:11:54,792
of forgetting...

915
01:12:17,042 --> 01:12:18,042
It's not that I don't want to help.

916
01:12:18,334 --> 01:12:19,959
It's not like I hate Song Shiqiao or anything.

917
01:12:20,334 --> 01:12:21,542
She needs an opportunity like this.

918
01:12:22,209 --> 01:12:23,626
But we don't need anyone else.

919
01:12:25,792 --> 01:12:26,584
What's that look for?

920
01:12:28,167 --> 01:12:29,542
No! She can't have my spot!

921
01:12:29,792 --> 01:12:30,501
Give her a chance.

922
01:12:30,834 --> 01:12:31,959
So when you called me over here

923
01:12:32,292 --> 01:12:33,084
you said "let's be friends",

924
01:12:33,459 --> 01:12:34,751
but this is what you really wanted?

925
01:12:35,167 --> 01:12:36,917
I'm glad you're getting over it so fast.

926
01:12:40,667 --> 01:12:41,751
Are you in love with her?

927
01:12:45,709 --> 01:12:46,542
Do you believe in fate?

928
01:12:47,126 --> 01:12:47,959
Spare me.

929
01:12:48,251 --> 01:12:49,667
I'm asking if you're in love with her.

930
01:12:51,126 --> 01:12:52,459
I tried everything I knew

931
01:12:52,834 --> 01:12:54,167
to get you to quit being so selfish,

932
01:12:54,501 --> 01:12:55,417
and I never could.

933
01:12:55,667 --> 01:12:57,126
She shows up in your life and bats her eyes

934
01:12:57,501 --> 01:12:58,542
and all of a sudden
you're thinking about other people.

935
01:13:01,001 --> 01:13:03,292
What in the hell did Song Shiqiao do to you?

936
01:13:10,126 --> 01:13:11,584
Do you remember how you chased me?

937
01:13:13,167 --> 01:13:14,001
Of course I remember.

938
01:13:14,959 --> 01:13:15,959
You wanted me to show you I meant it,

939
01:13:16,792 --> 01:13:18,542
so I sucked down a few dozen beers.

940
01:13:19,542 --> 01:13:21,834
Fine. Then show me you mean it again.

941
01:13:22,251 --> 01:13:23,126
That's not over the line, right?

942
01:13:25,167 --> 01:13:25,834
What do you want.

943
01:13:26,542 --> 01:13:27,751
Go smash that guitar.

944
01:13:38,584 --> 01:13:39,542
My friend told me

945
01:13:39,834 --> 01:13:42,209
this ballet troupe is about to have a performance,

946
01:13:42,751 --> 01:13:44,042
but they still need someone,

947
01:13:45,417 --> 01:13:46,334
so I recommended you.

948
01:13:48,917 --> 01:13:49,584
Me?

949
01:13:50,292 --> 01:13:51,667
Now you have the chance.

950
01:13:53,167 --> 01:13:54,126
You haven't changed your mind, have you?

951
01:14:08,959 --> 01:14:09,834
You're joking, right?

952
01:14:10,626 --> 01:14:12,084
I've had that guitar for years, You know that!

953
01:14:12,709 --> 01:14:13,667
Dancing is as important

954
01:14:14,001 --> 01:14:15,251
to me as that guitar is to you.

955
01:14:15,501 --> 01:14:16,126
You know that, right?

956
01:14:20,584 --> 01:14:21,792
Iv Xia,

957
01:14:39,959 --> 01:14:41,126
you'll never be Gong Ning.

958
01:14:42,542 --> 01:14:43,209
I know.

959
01:14:50,001 --> 01:14:50,459
Peng Wei!

960
01:14:58,626 --> 01:14:59,292
Thank you.

961
01:15:02,917 --> 01:15:06,084
Maybe I let you go this time, I can expect...

962
01:15:06,292 --> 01:15:09,584
The next time you fall in love

963
01:15:09,792 --> 01:15:16,417
She is a girl who suits you better than I do

964
01:15:38,209 --> 01:15:39,042
Well, you little bookworm,

965
01:15:39,667 --> 01:15:40,584
you're doing a good job!

966
01:15:41,542 --> 01:15:42,251
Let's go home.

967
01:16:15,084 --> 01:16:16,376
Did you bring my daughter to dance?

968
01:16:19,542 --> 01:16:21,042
Who do you think you are?

969
01:16:21,876 --> 01:16:23,584
What gives you the right to make that decision?

970
01:16:25,334 --> 01:16:27,917
As of this moment, our contract is over.

971
01:16:28,876 --> 01:16:29,626
Ok...

972
01:16:33,251 --> 01:16:35,334
when you planned this whole thing,

973
01:16:35,626 --> 01:16:37,459
did you think about what the worst possible
result would be?

974
01:16:40,292 --> 01:16:42,209
The worst thing that could happen is if she knew

975
01:16:42,542 --> 01:16:43,459
this was all an act.

976
01:16:45,126 --> 01:16:45,751
No.

977
01:16:47,376 --> 01:16:48,667
The worst thing that could happen

978
01:16:49,042 --> 01:16:50,709
is if Gong Ning actually fell in love
with your daughter.

979
01:16:51,417 --> 01:16:52,459
You're not Gong Ning any more.

980
01:16:52,876 --> 01:16:54,126
I'm not Iv Xia, either.

981
01:16:55,042 --> 01:16:57,084
Don't talk to me like you know about love!

982
01:16:57,501 --> 01:16:59,042
Do you know how serious my daughter's condition is?

983
01:17:01,417 --> 01:17:02,417
If I were Gong Ning,

984
01:17:04,209 --> 01:17:06,542
I'd want Song Shiqiao to be able
to live a full life.

985
01:18:12,542 --> 01:18:14,001
What should I do?

986
01:18:15,501 --> 01:18:17,584
You always told me you were an alien.

987
01:18:19,834 --> 01:18:22,084
This human, here on Earth, is having problems.

988
01:18:25,626 --> 01:18:26,501
But you...

989
01:18:28,542 --> 01:18:30,292
I don't know what planet you're on right now.

990
01:18:33,417 --> 01:18:34,042
1...

991
01:18:34,501 --> 01:18:35,084
2...

992
01:18:35,584 --> 01:18:36,209
3...

993
01:18:36,667 --> 01:18:37,209

1010
01:18:55,251 --> 01:18:56,501
Shiqiao, are you ok?

1011
01:18:56,792 --> 01:18:58,126
What's the matter?

1012
01:18:58,959 --> 01:18:59,751
Sorry.

1013
01:19:01,917 --> 01:19:02,501
Sorry.

1014
01:19:06,459 --> 01:19:07,042
Shiqiao,

1015
01:19:07,292 --> 01:19:08,001
are you ok?

1016
01:19:11,251 --> 01:19:11,876
I'm fine.

1017
01:19:23,292 --> 01:19:24,001
I'm fine.

1018
01:19:24,626 --> 01:19:27,626
I just wasn't timing my breathing right.

1019
01:19:31,834 --> 01:19:33,126
I just need to rest, and I'll be fine.

1020
01:19:49,209 --> 01:19:49,917
Hey...

1021
01:19:50,167 --> 01:19:51,292
Should I tilt my head like this,

1022
01:19:51,709 --> 01:19:52,584
or like this?

1023
01:19:54,292 --> 01:19:55,459
They're about the same.

1024
01:19:56,792 --> 01:19:58,209
My performance is tomorrow,

1025
01:19:58,501 --> 01:20:00,376
so can I get just a little constructive advice?

1026
01:20:02,792 --> 01:20:03,542
Shiqiao,

1027
01:20:04,792 --> 01:20:05,792
don't go tomorrow.

1028
01:20:11,542 --> 01:20:13,459
I scared you today, didn't it?

1029
01:20:17,001 --> 01:20:18,667
I finally understand how your mom feels,

1030
01:20:19,626 --> 01:20:21,042
the sensitivity, and the nervousness...

1031
01:20:22,709 --> 01:20:24,417
This is my own choice.

1032
01:20:26,126 --> 01:20:28,209
I don't want you to feel guilty about it.

1033
01:20:34,167 --> 01:20:35,084
I don't feel guilty,

1034
01:20:36,001 --> 01:20:37,167
I just changed my mind.

1035
01:20:38,584 --> 01:20:39,709
I don't want to do anything risky with you.

1036
01:20:40,459 --> 01:20:42,542
The truth is, with my condition,

1037
01:20:42,834 --> 01:20:43,917
every day is risky for me.

1038
01:20:44,709 --> 01:20:45,917
What's different this time

1039
01:20:46,251 --> 01:20:47,834
is that I'm choosing to take the risk.

1040
01:20:48,459 --> 01:20:50,834
To make a dream I've had for a long time come true.

1041
01:20:51,417 --> 01:20:52,501
I think that's worth it.

1042
01:20:53,917 --> 01:20:54,584
You're crazy!

1043
01:20:55,834 --> 01:20:57,667
If your mom smells alcohol when you go home

1044
01:20:58,126 --> 01:20:59,959
she'll dump gas on me and light me on fire!

1045
01:21:00,876 --> 01:21:01,709
I'm not going home.

1046
01:21:08,292 --> 01:21:10,417
We have something even crazier we have to do.

1047
01:21:11,417 --> 01:21:12,126
Don't we?

1048
01:26:24,751 --> 01:26:25,459
Gong Ning,

1049
01:26:26,834 --> 01:26:27,959
did you see?

1050
01:26:29,501 --> 01:26:30,667
Just now, in that moment,

1051
01:26:33,667 --> 01:26:35,209
My life was lit up.

1052
01:26:38,542 --> 01:26:39,751
Thank you.

1053
01:27:21,959 --> 01:27:22,709
Hurry up, call an ambulance.

1054
01:28:13,751 --> 01:28:15,501
I'm getting ready to sell the shop

1055
01:28:16,292 --> 01:28:17,334
and move somewhere else.

1056
01:28:19,667 --> 01:28:21,876
I thought you should have these things.

1057
01:28:25,834 --> 01:28:26,667
I hope...

1058
01:28:27,709 --> 01:28:29,167
you have a good life.

1059
01:28:37,126 --> 01:28:39,376
Do you regret asking me to pretend to be Gong Ning?

1060
01:28:51,417 --> 01:28:52,251
Mom,

1061
01:28:53,501 --> 01:28:55,751
by the time you hear this tape,

1062
01:28:57,001 --> 01:28:58,876
I'll already be in another world.

1063
01:29:02,417 --> 01:29:03,292
It's too bad.

1064
01:29:04,626 --> 01:29:06,292
I haven't left,

1065
01:29:07,417 --> 01:29:09,459
But I'm missing you already.

1066
01:29:11,626 --> 01:29:12,501
Mom,

1067
01:29:13,584 --> 01:29:15,084
I know, all these years,

1068
01:29:16,084 --> 01:29:18,417
you've kept a smile on your face for me.

1069
01:29:20,001 --> 01:29:22,084
Now, I'm on another planet, with dad.

1070
01:29:23,626 --> 01:29:26,626
Now, you can finally stop worrying
about me and relax.

1071
01:29:29,459 --> 01:29:31,876
I already planned your trip on a map,

1072
01:29:32,667 --> 01:29:34,334
so I want you to pack your bags

1073
01:29:35,209 --> 01:29:37,084
and go see mountains you've never seen

1074
01:29:37,959 --> 01:29:39,584
and travel rivers you've never traveled.

1075
01:29:41,376 --> 01:29:42,876
When you miss me,

1076
01:29:43,542 --> 01:29:44,959
look up at the sky.

1077
01:29:46,417 --> 01:29:50,376
Your alien and I will be up there, looking down,

1078
01:29:51,917 --> 01:29:53,376
watching you, always.

1079
01:30:02,667 --> 01:30:07,584
"The hand that plucks
the strings lacks your warmth,

1080
01:30:08,126 --> 01:30:12,417
and I can't play happiness on them any more

1081
01:30:12,667 --> 01:30:17,959
I can't stop retracing the steps of your dance

1082
01:30:18,209 --> 01:30:23,876
as my eyes blur...

1083
01:30:24,709 --> 01:30:29,584
I don't fix the broken lights in this room

1084
01:30:30,126 --> 01:30:34,584
because I'm not brave enough
to illuminate my loneliness

1085
01:30:34,834 --> 01:30:40,126
The sudden silences are
when I think of your smile

1086
01:30:40,376 --> 01:30:46,167
How long has it been since you've been gone?

1087
01:30:48,792 --> 01:30:53,417
I cry like a child

1088
01:30:53,667 --> 01:30:58,251
thinking you'll come back,

1089
01:30:58,501 --> 01:31:01,126
just to fill the space in my mind

1090
01:31:01,376 --> 01:31:04,501
that you left empty

1091
01:31:04,792 --> 01:31:09,792
I can't leave the warmth of my memories

1092
01:31:10,167 --> 01:31:15,459
All I can do is cry like a child,

1093
01:31:15,751 --> 01:31:20,376
because you'll never come back

1094
01:31:20,584 --> 01:31:23,126
In another time and place

1095
01:31:23,376 --> 01:31:26,667
it might have worked,

1096
01:31:26,876 --> 01:31:31,709
we could have frozen love at the start

1097
01:31:43,709 --> 01:31:46,542
People who leave don't always
just hurt others, right?

1098
01:31:47,501 --> 01:31:49,959
Like you, Gong Ning.

1099
01:31:51,751 --> 01:31:55,126
After you left, you gave me the hope
to keep living.

1100
01:31:56,126 --> 01:31:59,834
And now, that hope became reality.

1101
01:32:00,667 --> 01:32:01,667
Didn't it, Iv Xia?

1102
01:32:03,084 --> 01:32:04,542
Can I call you Iv Xia?

1103
01:32:05,042 --> 01:32:05,584
My...

1104
01:32:07,959 --> 01:32:09,334
Can I call you Iv Xia?

1105
01:32:09,917 --> 01:32:11,126
My bad boy.

1106
01:32:18,542 --> 01:32:20,042
Can I call you Iv Xia?

1107
01:32:20,709 --> 01:32:21,917
You bad boy.

1108
01:32:23,542 --> 01:32:27,167
The truth is, the first time I saw you,

1109
01:32:28,251 --> 01:32:29,751
I knew you weren't Gong Ning.

1110
01:32:31,376 --> 01:32:33,751
When my mom was making this plan,

1111
01:32:34,126 --> 01:32:35,501
she underestimated my memory.

1112
01:32:36,626 --> 01:32:38,876
It's not as bad as she thought.

1113
01:32:41,376 --> 01:32:44,251
Now that you know I knew,

1114
01:32:45,542 --> 01:32:48,792
you might be having doubts about my feelings
during this little game.

1115
01:32:50,417 --> 01:32:53,292
Alright, go back to the warehouse.

1116
01:32:54,167 --> 01:32:55,876
Let down the tapestry I made for you,

1117
01:32:56,584 --> 01:32:57,876
and turn off the lights.

1118
01:32:58,792 --> 01:33:00,376
The answer is there.

1119
01:33:27,917 --> 01:33:29,542
Do you remember that fat music teacher
we used to have?

1120
01:33:29,834 --> 01:33:31,001
You mean the Latin fanatic?

1121
01:33:31,376 --> 01:33:32,084
Yeah.

1122
01:33:32,334 --> 01:33:33,167
Every time he put this song on

1123
01:33:33,667 --> 01:33:34,959
he always got up and danced,

1124
01:33:48,667 --> 01:33:50,167
Do you remember this flavor?

1125
01:33:51,709 --> 01:33:55,126
I told you, it would always remind you

1126
01:33:56,292 --> 01:33:58,751
that our love was real.

1127
01:34:08,876 --> 01:34:11,376
Don't cry, you bad boy.

1128
01:34:12,292 --> 01:34:15,209
You have to know I haven't gone very far.

1129
01:34:16,542 --> 01:34:20,126
When you sing, I'll be the notes.

1130
01:34:21,334 --> 01:34:25,084
When you play the guitar, I'll be the strings.

1131
01:34:26,209 --> 01:34:30,084
When you're frustrated, I'll be a bottle of beer.

1132
01:34:30,917 --> 01:34:35,834
When you're lonely, I'll be a record.

1133
01:34:40,501 --> 01:34:41,334
I love you,

1134
01:34:41,876 --> 01:34:44,209
Iv Xia, or Gong Ning.

1135
01:34:45,876 --> 01:34:47,042
Whatever

1136
01:35:28,792 --> 01:35:33,584
"The hand that plucks
the strings lacks your warmth,

1137
01:35:34,209 --> 01:35:38,501
and I can't play happiness on them any more

1138
01:35:38,709 --> 01:35:44,001
I can't stop retracing the steps of your dance

1139
01:35:44,209 --> 01:35:49,251
as my eyes blur...

1140
01:35:50,751 --> 01:35:55,709
When I look up on a street I know,

1141
01:35:56,292 --> 01:36:00,667
all I see is a world without you

1142
01:36:00,876 --> 01:36:06,084
The sudden silences are
when I think of your smile

1143
01:36:06,334 --> 01:36:13,501
How long has it been since you've been gone?

1144
01:36:14,917 --> 01:36:19,251
I cry like a child

1145
01:36:19,792 --> 01:36:24,417
thinking you'll come back,

1146
01:36:24,667 --> 01:36:27,126
just to fill the space in my mind.

1147
01:36:27,376 --> 01:36:30,501
That you left empty

1148
01:36:30,792 --> 01:36:35,167
I can't leave the warmth of my memories

1149
01:36:38,167 --> 01:36:42,001
Wife, Let's son is singing.

1150
01:36:44,126 --> 01:36:45,376
You just listen to

1151
01:36:46,792 --> 01:36:49,292
In another time and place

1152
01:36:49,542 --> 01:36:52,751
it might have worked,

1153
01:36:52,959 --> 01:36:57,501
we could have frozen love at the start

1154
01:36:59,584 --> 01:37:01,584
Remember me!"

1155
01:37:22,667 --> 01:37:23,459
The education office reports

1156
01:37:23,709 --> 01:37:25,834
that the weather channel has
just issued a typhoon warning...

1157
01:37:26,126 --> 01:37:28,042
The child is named Gong Ning. What a pity.

1158
01:37:28,376 --> 01:37:30,376
He was always getting into so much trouble.

1159
01:37:31,084 --> 01:37:33,209
What surprised me was he was trying to save someone.

1160
01:37:33,542 --> 01:37:35,542
Yeah. I heard the police say

1161
01:37:35,876 --> 01:37:36,959
the woman he was trying to save,

1162
01:37:37,292 --> 01:37:38,667
and god only knows why,

1163
01:37:39,251 --> 01:37:41,917
was just standing in the middle of the road
holding a sweater.

1164
01:37:42,334 --> 01:37:44,251
Gong Ning ran to push her out of the way,

1165
01:37:44,584 --> 01:37:47,959
and they both got run over.

1166
01:39:29,417 --> 01:39:32,042
I read the instructions for the medicine
that my mom hid in the cabinet.

1167
01:39:32,751 --> 01:39:33,709
It said

1168
01:39:33,959 --> 01:39:36,584
this medicine can affect my cerebral cortex,

1169
01:39:37,167 --> 01:39:40,709
so I might actually just be imagining all this.

1170
01:39:41,626 --> 01:39:42,667
I was gonna say!

1171
01:39:42,917 --> 01:39:44,667
How could I be using a tape recorder
that's this color?

1172
01:39:45,126 --> 01:39:45,959
I changed the case.

1173
01:39:48,667 --> 01:39:50,376
And the model doesn't look like
it's from back then, either.

1174
01:39:52,292 --> 01:39:53,626
I told you, don't be so serious!

1175
01:39:54,459 --> 01:39:56,334
How could I be imagining all this?

1176
01:40:01,001 --> 01:40:02,001
Do you play an instrument?

1177
01:40:02,709 --> 01:40:03,459
I'm the lead singer.

1178
01:40:03,876 --> 01:40:04,709
You're a soloist?

1179
01:40:05,376 --> 01:40:07,001
Sing "The Slap of the Waves
on Honghu Lake" for me.

1180
01:40:11,459 --> 01:40:12,251
Wait, what waves are slapping who?

1181
01:40:16,834 --> 01:40:17,292
How is she?

1182
01:40:17,584 --> 01:40:18,209
Who?

1183
01:40:18,709 --> 01:40:19,334
Song Shiqiao!

1184
01:40:20,834 --> 01:40:22,209
She's coming to watch us rehearse in a bit.

1185
01:40:22,834 --> 01:40:23,584
She should call before she comes.

1186
01:40:24,209 --> 01:40:24,792
Ok.

1187
01:40:28,126 --> 01:40:29,042
Ok. Let's go.

1188
01:40:33,209 --> 01:40:40,042
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8...

1189
01:40:40,667 --> 01:40:43,459
Alright, 15 minute break. Good job, everyone.

1190
01:40:45,376 --> 01:40:46,042
Iv Xia...

1191
01:40:52,917 --> 01:40:53,542
Iv Xia...

1192
01:40:54,626 --> 01:40:57,209
Pass this CD to Mrs. Chen for me. Thank you.

1193
01:41:15,876 --> 01:41:17,084
Did Song Shiqiao come to see you?

1194
01:41:19,584 --> 01:41:20,459
You didn't tell her anything, right?

1195
01:41:22,001 --> 01:41:23,834
Well, keep a lid on it. I know.

1196
01:42:09,501 --> 01:42:11,334
Thank you for being in my life.

1197
01:42:11,917 --> 01:42:13,084
You bad boy.

1198
01:42:22,459 --> 01:42:22,917
Iv Xia,

1199
01:42:26,167 --> 01:42:27,542
what... what was that name they called you?

1200
01:42:31,001 --> 01:42:35,251
Traffic accident report

1201
01:42:35,417 --> 01:42:38,917
Gong Ning and Iv Xia's mother
died in the same car accident.
