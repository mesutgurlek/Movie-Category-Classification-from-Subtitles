Welcome to the Brinkley School and
our first-grade show. I'm George Hanson.

3
00:00:55,987 --> 00:01:01,659
This afternoon we are proud to present
our own adaptation of The Little Mermaid.

4
00:01:01,743 --> 00:01:07,248
Music will be provided by the Brinkley Trio,
led by my co-teacher Melissa Marx.

5
00:01:11,961 --> 00:01:13,505
Now on with the show.

6
00:01:14,381 --> 00:01:18,385
Hi. I'm Nina Borowski,
and I think all of you are new here,

7
00:01:18,468 --> 00:01:21,346
so welcome to
the Cobble Hill Community Center.

8
00:01:21,429 --> 00:01:25,517
I'll be your group leader, and
we can talk about whatever you'd like:

9
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,145
School, home, jobs,

10
00:01:29,229 --> 00:01:31,523
sex, anything.

11
00:01:33,316 --> 00:01:36,027
Sea snakes.

12
00:01:37,612 --> 00:01:39,906
Stingrays.

13
00:01:44,411 --> 00:01:46,413
Did I miss anything?

14
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:48,915
- Honey, I just signed Castro.
- Shh!

15
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:52,919
Sally, you're on.

16
00:01:58,091 --> 00:02:01,136
I know exactly what you've come for.

17
00:02:01,219 --> 00:02:04,472
There's this boy I've been seeing,
and now he wants to fuck me.

18
00:02:04,556 --> 00:02:08,059
- He's only gonna hurt you.
- Do you wanna fuck him?

19
00:02:08,143 --> 00:02:10,645
Well, he's cute.

20
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:14,774
- Does he say he loves you?
- Yeah, but he just wants to get in my pants.

21
00:02:14,858 --> 00:02:18,361
But do you love him?
Nina, isn't that right?

22
00:02:18,445 --> 00:02:20,655
Well, I don't know about that.

23
00:02:20,739 --> 00:02:25,910
But what I do know is, if I have sex
with a guy, I want him to be my friend.

24
00:02:25,994 --> 00:02:28,455
So let's start with do you like him?

25
00:02:28,538 --> 00:02:32,208
I'll give you anything, if I can have my prince.

26
00:02:32,292 --> 00:02:34,502
Come with me then.

27
00:02:34,586 --> 00:02:38,548
And whilst my slave girl
weaves her magic spell,

28
00:02:38,631 --> 00:02:40,717
I will cut off your tongue!

29
00:02:42,469 --> 00:02:45,388
Slave girl, play!

30
00:02:55,315 --> 00:02:57,400
Where is he?

31
00:02:59,903 --> 00:03:04,449
- Who are you looking for, George?
- Just a friend of mine.

32
00:03:04,532 --> 00:03:07,660
He says if I don't fuck him,
he'll find another girlfriend.

33
00:03:07,744 --> 00:03:14,000
Kiesha, I don't claim to be an expert on love,
but I do know what can screw up your life.

34
00:03:14,084 --> 00:03:17,545
- So should I do it?
- You can say no.

35
00:03:17,629 --> 00:03:21,257
Keeping your boyfriend happy
is not your full-time job.

36
00:03:21,341 --> 00:03:24,469
You've got school, family,

37
00:03:24,552 --> 00:03:27,555
work, your friends...

38
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:29,724
You call the shots.

39
00:03:31,976 --> 00:03:34,396
You guys were great!

40
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:37,023
Excuse us. Come on. Get in line.

41
00:03:47,158 --> 00:03:49,994
- Daddy!
- Oh, you were great.

42
00:03:50,078 --> 00:03:52,956
- You were terrific. I loved you up there.
- Mommy!

43
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:56,459
Mr Hanson, that was a great show.
I think that was your best yet.

44
00:03:56,543 --> 00:03:59,713
- We had a great sea witch and cast.
- Don't be so humble.

45
00:03:59,796 --> 00:04:03,216
I've seen a lot of kids' shows - they bore me.
This one had grit.

46
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:06,761
- Grit?
- Yeah. It was the real stuff. Not all gooey.

47
00:04:06,845 --> 00:04:09,806
- Thank you, Mr Miller.
- Call me Sidney. Let's go.

48
00:04:09,889 --> 00:04:14,019
George, we're having a few people for dinner.
We'd love it if you'd join us.

49
00:04:14,102 --> 00:04:18,148
- That'd be great.
- I'm sorry, Mrs Miller. I'm meeting a friend.

50
00:04:18,231 --> 00:04:21,401
Bring your friend. It's casual.
Everyone's dying to meet you.

51
00:04:21,484 --> 00:04:23,653
- Really?
- Listen, you're a hero.

52
00:04:23,737 --> 00:04:27,323
Who cares if I can get Fidel
a million dollars to write his diary?

53
00:04:27,407 --> 00:04:30,368
- You're fighting for the future of this country.
- 7.30.

54
00:04:30,452 --> 00:04:35,415
You were so good. I can't believe
how good you were. I loved everything...

55
00:04:35,498 --> 00:04:37,584
Where's Dr Joley?

56
00:04:39,252 --> 00:04:42,714
I'd kill my boyfriend if he missed my show.

57
00:04:43,631 --> 00:04:46,801
Bye-bye. Good job, you guys.
It was great.

58
00:04:46,885 --> 00:04:50,513
- Just give me back two.
- Hey.

59
00:04:50,597 --> 00:04:54,309
Thank you. I got stuck in a faculty meeting,
and then the subway...

60
00:04:54,392 --> 00:04:59,773
And then the dog ate your homework.
See you tomorrow, George.

61
00:04:59,856 --> 00:05:03,109
- I just hate myself for missing this.
- Really, it's OK.

62
00:05:03,443 --> 00:05:05,570
Hungry? I'm in the mood for sushi.

63
00:05:05,653 --> 00:05:09,616
I wish. I just told Constance Miller
we'd have dinner at her house.

64
00:05:09,699 --> 00:05:13,578
I'm sorry, Joley. She ambushed me.
But she said it was casual.

65
00:05:13,661 --> 00:05:19,125
George, Sidney Miller is the most
powerful literary agent in the world.

66
00:05:19,209 --> 00:05:23,630
Casual to the Millers is not casual to us.
I was hoping we could talk tonight alone.

67
00:05:23,713 --> 00:05:27,258
- OK, I'll cancel.
- You can't. It's important for your career.

68
00:05:27,342 --> 00:05:29,427
- We'll talk later.
- Are you sure?

69
00:05:29,511 --> 00:05:34,391
Well, I wrote it as an academic book,
but I think it could be a best seller.

70
00:05:34,474 --> 00:05:38,269
And Sean Connery
would make a great George Bernard Shaw.

71
00:05:38,353 --> 00:05:42,565
Maybe your friend George could do
something with it. That was a great show.

72
00:05:42,649 --> 00:05:46,611
- So did you go to a teachers college?
- No, I was premed at college.

73
00:05:46,695 --> 00:05:49,614
Oh, God. Your poor mother.

74
00:05:49,698 --> 00:05:51,616
George? George?

75
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:54,160
I want you to meet
my great friend, Joyce Myers.

76
00:05:54,244 --> 00:05:56,788
Oh, Joyce!

77
00:05:56,871 --> 00:06:02,919
How are you? I so wanted to see your show,
but I was in a lunch for King Hussein.

78
00:06:03,002 --> 00:06:05,422
How is he? Sidney's waiting for his book.

79
00:06:05,505 --> 00:06:09,259
Well, Noor is adorable,
and the children...

80
00:06:24,733 --> 00:06:28,028
Dr Joley seems to have made a hit
with my stepsister.

81
00:06:29,904 --> 00:06:32,907
- How long have you two been together?
- Uh, four years.

82
00:06:32,991 --> 00:06:37,037
Sidney represents RuPaul.
We'll have you all over some time.

83
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:42,333
Sidney, don't you think it's time for a revised
encyclopaedia of the American theatre?

84
00:06:42,417 --> 00:06:44,753
- When's the Pavarotti gala?
- Next week.

85
00:06:44,836 --> 00:06:50,341
You've done such wonderful things for that
company. You completely turned it around.

86
00:06:50,425 --> 00:06:55,680
Of course, opera's not my thing,
but I adore the Three Tenors...

87
00:06:55,764 --> 00:07:00,727
- Sounds like your show was a huge hit.
- Yeah, well, the kids worked really hard.

88
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:03,188
- I'm sorry I missed it.
- Oh, that's OK.

89
00:07:03,271 --> 00:07:05,982
I was in bed with King Hussein.

90
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:11,863
- George Hanson.
- Hi. Nina Borowski. Hi.

91
00:07:11,946 --> 00:07:15,325
- Oh, so, you're the stepsister?
- Uh-huh. Yeah.

92
00:07:15,408 --> 00:07:20,580
I bring the income level down at
Constance's parties by at least three figures.

93
00:07:20,663 --> 00:07:23,124
- I can help you in that department.
- Thank you.

94
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:25,293
My pleasure.

95
00:07:25,377 --> 00:07:29,964
I heard all about you from Dr Joley.
Sorry about you and him.

96
00:07:30,924 --> 00:07:33,301
- Hm?
- Oh...

97
00:07:33,385 --> 00:07:36,513
OK, here we go. Come here. Come here.

98
00:07:38,306 --> 00:07:41,810
You see that man
standing there with my evil stepsister?

99
00:07:41,893 --> 00:07:44,437
- Mm-hm.
- That's my husband.

100
00:07:44,938 --> 00:07:47,524
- You married?
- No, I'm not.

101
00:07:47,607 --> 00:07:51,403
But she's hoping I'll marry that man
because she hates my boyfriend.

102
00:07:51,486 --> 00:07:53,822
Oh!

103
00:07:53,905 --> 00:07:56,449
You'll meet her later. Excuse me.

104
00:07:56,533 --> 00:08:00,745
- Oh, Joyce, this is Stephen Saint.
- All right, we're clear.

105
00:08:00,829 --> 00:08:03,289
- She's always doing this to me.
- Why?

106
00:08:03,373 --> 00:08:07,293
Because my boyfriend's
a penniless legal-aid lawyer.

107
00:08:07,377 --> 00:08:12,632
I'm a counsellor at a community centre and
I live in... a walk-up in Brooklyn.

108
00:08:12,716 --> 00:08:16,886
- It sounds fine to me. I love Brooklyn.
- Yeah, me too.

109
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:21,683
You should visit me. There are some
really nice apartments in my neighbourhood.

110
00:08:21,766 --> 00:08:24,352
- I'm not looking for an apartment.
- You're not?

111
00:08:24,436 --> 00:08:26,312
No. I live with Joley.

112
00:08:26,396 --> 00:08:29,983
But he told me at dinner
you might be looking for a place soon.

113
00:08:30,066 --> 00:08:31,735
He told you what?

114
00:08:31,818 --> 00:08:35,655
When he found out I had a spare room,
he asked if you could move in with me.

115
00:08:35,739 --> 00:08:39,451
- That's insane.
- I thought so.

116
00:08:39,534 --> 00:08:43,663
It's not every day I invite the lover
of my dinner companion to live with me,

117
00:08:43,747 --> 00:08:45,707
but if you're desperate...

118
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:48,585
I don't know what you're talking about.

119
00:09:03,391 --> 00:09:05,935
Maybe I have this completely backwards.

120
00:09:06,019 --> 00:09:11,399
Maybe he meant for
the two of you to move to Brooklyn.

121
00:09:11,483 --> 00:09:14,319
What else did he say?

122
00:09:14,402 --> 00:09:16,780
Have you never discussed this before?

123
00:09:16,863 --> 00:09:19,699
No, this is a total first for me.

124
00:09:19,783 --> 00:09:22,202
- Oh, my God.
- Nina?

125
00:09:23,119 --> 00:09:26,498
- Nina, this is Stephen Saint.
- Hi.

126
00:09:26,581 --> 00:09:31,586
I was asking Constance all about you.
You are very fresh and natural.

127
00:09:31,669 --> 00:09:35,423
He is the most fabulous
creative director at Saatchi's.

128
00:09:35,507 --> 00:09:39,469
And you're a cute shrink.
That's an unbeatable combination.

129
00:09:39,552 --> 00:09:43,598
My sister likes to say I'm a shrink.
I'm actually a social worker. Hi.

130
00:09:43,682 --> 00:09:47,852
George, come with me.
I'm having problems with my centrepiece.

131
00:09:47,936 --> 00:09:49,604
Oh, hey, um,

132
00:09:49,688 --> 00:09:53,608
I think the work that you do is fantastic.
I think you got a lot of courage.

133
00:09:53,692 --> 00:09:58,863
George, I'm in the book. If there's anything
I can do... I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

134
00:09:58,947 --> 00:09:59,989
What did she say?

135
00:10:00,323 --> 00:10:02,033
Good night.

136
00:10:02,117 --> 00:10:07,580
You were great.
You were just great! Oh!

137
00:10:07,664 --> 00:10:11,543
And those women. My God. Oh!

138
00:10:11,626 --> 00:10:15,922
They were swooning all over you.
You were the centre of attention.

139
00:10:16,005 --> 00:10:21,428
And I, of course,
was stuck next to that social worker.

140
00:10:21,511 --> 00:10:23,596
Oh, well.

141
00:10:34,649 --> 00:10:37,152
- You told her I wanted to move to Brooklyn.
- What?

142
00:10:37,235 --> 00:10:40,488
Goddammit, Joley.
You told her I was moving out.

143
00:10:40,572 --> 00:10:43,575
I told her you might be
looking for an apartment.

144
00:10:43,658 --> 00:10:47,829
- I wanted to wait till your play was open.
- You didn't waste any time.

145
00:10:47,912 --> 00:10:51,291
Can we talk about this when we get home?
This isn't appropriate.

146
00:10:51,374 --> 00:10:56,087
Really? But it's appropriate for me to hear
my relationship is over from a stranger.

147
00:10:56,171 --> 00:10:59,090
Our relationship isn't over.

148
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,389
Who are you sleeping with, Joley?

149
00:11:06,473 --> 00:11:08,641
Please...

150
00:11:08,725 --> 00:11:10,810
That's just...

151
00:11:11,811 --> 00:11:17,359
- That's just a little simple.
- I'm a simple guy. It's why I teach first grade.

152
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,573
- I'm going to be 40 this summer.
- Oh, God.

153
00:11:23,656 --> 00:11:27,827
But we're both too young
to settle for a twin-bedded friendship.

154
00:11:27,911 --> 00:11:31,873
This hasn't really been working
for a long time.

155
00:11:31,956 --> 00:11:34,334
Who have you got lined up, Joley?

156
00:11:39,005 --> 00:11:41,925
He's a student of mine, but...

157
00:11:42,008 --> 00:11:45,261
I... I don't know what to say.

158
00:11:45,345 --> 00:11:48,848
Is this student
the reason you missed my play?

159
00:11:48,932 --> 00:11:52,143
He's just breaking up with a woman
and he wanted to talk.

160
00:11:52,227 --> 00:11:54,896
I want to be with him,
but I don't wanna hurt you.

161
00:11:54,979 --> 00:11:58,566
- You're my best friend. What should I do?
- Fuck you, Joley!

162
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:02,487
And fuck your student.
And fuck our friendship.

163
00:12:03,822 --> 00:12:08,743
I didn't wanna tell you this
until you were ready.

164
00:12:08,827 --> 00:12:11,329
I'm a nice man, George.

165
00:12:44,779 --> 00:12:46,865
Great neighbourhood.

166
00:12:49,743 --> 00:12:53,079
Looks very safe here. Lot of families.

167
00:12:53,872 --> 00:12:56,374
Hey, look, I'll call you.

168
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:18,646
I can't get Showtime or HBO,
never mind the Food Network.

169
00:13:19,564 --> 00:13:25,695
- I'm here for Nina Borowski.
- After you fix hers, you come and fix mine.

170
00:13:29,741 --> 00:13:31,493
- Hi.
- Hi.

171
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:34,662
This is really embarrassing.

172
00:13:34,746 --> 00:13:36,831
Oh, come on in.

173
00:13:39,459 --> 00:13:41,294
I was happy you called.

174
00:13:41,378 --> 00:13:45,799
I mean, I wasn't happy you needed
a place to stay, but still happy you called.

175
00:13:45,882 --> 00:13:48,051
Come on up. I'm on the second floor.

176
00:13:48,802 --> 00:13:50,887
Come on in.

177
00:13:53,807 --> 00:13:57,227
- This is great.
- Let me show you the room.

178
00:14:00,105 --> 00:14:02,190
Oh, it's nice.

179
00:14:02,273 --> 00:14:08,279
It could use some personality, but somebody
at the centre can make you some curtains.

180
00:14:08,363 --> 00:14:10,240
This won't be for very long.

181
00:14:10,323 --> 00:14:13,576
I can move in with my brother
when his girlfriend moves out.

182
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:15,662
No rush.

183
00:14:15,745 --> 00:14:18,248
And this is the bathroom.

184
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:21,876
This is my bedroom.

185
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,587
Oh! Fuck!

186
00:14:24,671 --> 00:14:26,589
- You get a lot of light.
- Yeah.

187
00:14:26,673 --> 00:14:29,384
- And this is the office.
- Oh.

188
00:14:29,467 --> 00:14:32,053
That's it.

189
00:14:32,137 --> 00:14:33,388
It's nice.

190
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:39,144
- Yeah, he's been engaged seven times.
- Wow. Really? Your brother?

191
00:14:39,227 --> 00:14:40,270
Mm-hm.

192
00:14:40,353 --> 00:14:46,317
- Would you like me to fix you up with him?
- Thanks. I've got my hands full with Vince.

193
00:14:46,401 --> 00:14:48,486
It's ready.

194
00:14:50,989 --> 00:14:53,408
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

195
00:14:53,491 --> 00:14:57,412
- How come I'm staying here and he isn't?
- Oh, Vince works fine as it is.

196
00:14:57,495 --> 00:14:59,205
Sit down.

197
00:14:59,289 --> 00:15:01,624
OK.

198
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:03,585
Thanks.

199
00:15:03,668 --> 00:15:06,963
You saved my life. Really.

200
00:15:10,216 --> 00:15:14,220
- No hot water between two and seven.
- Did you get your TV fixed, Mrs Sarni?

201
00:15:14,304 --> 00:15:17,307
Why, you wanna come over and watch?

202
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:25,190
OK, so you have the keys, the phone number.
You know the indoor buzzer doesn't work.

203
00:15:25,273 --> 00:15:30,278
The Korean deli opposite the subway
is open till midnight. Avoid the salad bar.

204
00:15:30,362 --> 00:15:34,240
Toaster's broken. Use the broiler instead.
Mail comes in the morning.

205
00:15:34,324 --> 00:15:38,078
Don't let in any gas men,
unless you think either of us'd be interested.

206
00:15:38,161 --> 00:15:40,663
- This is me.
- Well, thanks for everything.

207
00:15:40,747 --> 00:15:45,919
Oh, sure. The subway is one block that way.
I'll see you later.

208
00:15:46,002 --> 00:15:49,589
- What's happened to Vince?
- Nothing has happened to Vince.

209
00:15:49,672 --> 00:15:52,300
- What's happened to Joley?
- Nothing.

210
00:15:52,384 --> 00:15:54,636
I called you there. He said you'd moved.

211
00:15:54,719 --> 00:15:58,098
So we did it on Saturday night.

212
00:15:58,181 --> 00:15:59,641
And was it good?

213
00:15:59,724 --> 00:16:03,645
It was OK - until on Sunday
I saw him with another girl.

214
00:16:03,728 --> 00:16:06,022
What a moron!

215
00:16:06,106 --> 00:16:11,820
Kiesha, Kiesha,
I like sex and I like boys a lot,

216
00:16:11,903 --> 00:16:18,076
but I am not about to waste my time with a
guy who doesn't see things the way that I do.

217
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:20,662
Do you really need this guy?

218
00:16:20,745 --> 00:16:22,831
This is the Earth.

219
00:16:22,914 --> 00:16:26,584
And this tack, that's us, right here.
And the lamp is the sun.

220
00:16:26,668 --> 00:16:28,545
So, why does it get dark?

221
00:16:28,628 --> 00:16:32,048
The Earth spins.

222
00:16:32,132 --> 00:16:34,467
Very good. Because the Earth spins.

223
00:16:34,551 --> 00:16:37,679
- And how do we know that?
- Copernicus.

224
00:16:40,849 --> 00:16:42,934
Nina?

225
00:16:44,185 --> 00:16:45,979
Nina, is that you?

226
00:16:46,062 --> 00:16:50,608
Hey, George. How are you? Vince McBride.
Nina's told me all about you.

227
00:16:50,692 --> 00:16:52,861
- Nice to meet you.
- Glad you're here.

228
00:16:52,944 --> 00:16:56,031
I feel better knowing somebody's
keeping an eye out for my girl.

229
00:16:56,114 --> 00:16:59,701
- Hey. Vince, meet George.
- We're old friends already.

230
00:16:59,784 --> 00:17:03,621
George, join us for a cup of tea?
You don't have to put on a robe for me.

231
00:17:03,705 --> 00:17:09,169
Yeah. In fact, George, you could probably take
off all your clothes and Vince wouldn't mind.

232
00:17:09,252 --> 00:17:13,673
She's eating me alive.
I dote on her and she's eating me alive.

233
00:17:13,757 --> 00:17:16,301
See, aren't you glad
you settled down with us?

234
00:17:17,177 --> 00:17:20,722
I was gonna be a teacher once -
get 'em while they're young.

235
00:17:20,805 --> 00:17:24,434
Teach 'em they don't have to believe
somebody else holds the cards.

236
00:17:24,517 --> 00:17:28,021
- He knows, Vince.
- No, he knows and he doesn't know.

237
00:17:28,104 --> 00:17:32,776
- Why don't you teach at a public school?
- I got ajob at the Brinkley School.

238
00:17:32,859 --> 00:17:36,571
But you're gay. Shouldn't you
stick up for the disenfranchised?

239
00:17:36,654 --> 00:17:41,159
- Can't we talk about the movie, please?
- Wait. Mind if I ask how much you get paid?

240
00:17:41,242 --> 00:17:46,081
- You make more than four figures, right?
- In the very early five figures.

241
00:17:46,164 --> 00:17:50,668
Oh, Christ Almighty.
And they're all fucking millionaires.

242
00:17:50,752 --> 00:17:53,463
They couldn't eat lunch
on what they're paying you.

243
00:17:53,546 --> 00:17:58,635
You gotta organise the teachers. I'll help you.
You're all getting screwed, you know that?

244
00:17:58,718 --> 00:18:02,847
Well, thanks. That's all great advice.

245
00:18:02,931 --> 00:18:07,519
But I'm afraid I have school tomorrow, so...

246
00:18:07,602 --> 00:18:09,979
- It was great to meet you.
- You too.

247
00:18:10,063 --> 00:18:12,148
- Good night, George.
- Good night.

248
00:18:12,232 --> 00:18:14,317
Night, George.

249
00:18:16,986 --> 00:18:21,741
- Oh, you terrorised him.
- What? We were having a nice conversation.

250
00:18:21,825 --> 00:18:25,078
You told him he had the wrong job
and he made no money.

251
00:18:25,161 --> 00:18:30,083
No, I told him he had the rightjob
in the wrong place, and made no money.

252
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:33,545
- You don't even know him.
- It never stopped me before.

253
00:18:33,628 --> 00:18:37,632
My stepsister is right.
You are just a bulldozer.

254
00:18:37,716 --> 00:18:39,926
What? I'm a pussycat.

255
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:44,305
Did I get angry with you when you let
a gay guy move in here instead of me? No.

256
00:18:44,389 --> 00:18:47,058
- I like him.
- Vince, you don't have to like him.

257
00:18:47,142 --> 00:18:51,771
But there is one thing. How come it's OK
for him to live on top of you and not me?

258
00:18:51,855 --> 00:18:55,275
He's not living on top of me
and he's leaving in two weeks.

259
00:18:55,358 --> 00:18:59,904
He's never going anywhere. He's gonna
fall in love with you and turn straight.

260
00:18:59,988 --> 00:19:05,535
- You're crazy.
- Not if you're looking at what I'm looking at.

261
00:19:05,618 --> 00:19:07,954
- Vince.
- What?

262
00:19:08,038 --> 00:19:10,331
Get in here.

263
00:19:22,093 --> 00:19:23,595
Hi.

264
00:19:23,678 --> 00:19:25,930
Hey.

265
00:19:26,014 --> 00:19:28,933
Late-night comfort food - bad habit.

266
00:19:29,017 --> 00:19:32,062
Shh. Vince is asleep.

267
00:19:34,522 --> 00:19:38,943
He's really very kind.
He just felt threatened by you.

268
00:19:39,027 --> 00:19:43,239
- That's insane.
- No, it isn't.

269
00:19:43,323 --> 00:19:46,451
He asked me the same thing you did.

270
00:19:47,911 --> 00:19:50,038
Why am I living here and he isn't?

271
00:19:50,121 --> 00:19:51,790
Bingo.

272
00:19:51,873 --> 00:19:55,001
Maybe you should be the counsellor.

273
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:59,506
Do you love him?

274
00:20:01,049 --> 00:20:03,134
Yeah.

275
00:20:04,094 --> 00:20:06,304
Whatever that means.

276
00:20:06,388 --> 00:20:12,560
I just don't know if I should be living
with him. Vince can really fill a room.

277
00:20:12,686 --> 00:20:14,979
Did you love Joley?

278
00:20:17,148 --> 00:20:19,234
Well, who knows?

279
00:20:21,444 --> 00:20:23,154
I thought so.

280
00:20:24,614 --> 00:20:27,450
Oh, God...

281
00:20:27,534 --> 00:20:30,453
- George, I'm sorry.
- No, it's...

282
00:20:31,705 --> 00:20:36,126
It's so stupid, you know.
I know - he's a prick.

283
00:20:36,209 --> 00:20:40,380
- I keep thinking I should have seen it coming.
- No. No.

284
00:20:40,463 --> 00:20:43,425
You did nothing wrong.

285
00:20:43,508 --> 00:20:46,886
You... You just trusted him.

286
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:52,475
- But you wouldn't have let this happen.
- Oh, yeah, sure. I don't trust anybody.

287
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:57,272
Particularly not amusing,
good-looking, intelligent guys like Joley.

288
00:20:57,355 --> 00:21:00,650
- And he has great taste.
- Mm.

289
00:21:00,734 --> 00:21:06,614
Well, he doesn't have such great taste,
otherwise he'd still be with you.

290
00:21:10,535 --> 00:21:12,620
Thank you.

291
00:21:19,669 --> 00:21:22,422
- We should go dancing.
- What?

292
00:21:22,505 --> 00:21:26,968
The community centre on Friday nights.
I'm signing us up.

293
00:21:27,302 --> 00:21:31,473
You must think of every dance
as a three-minute love affair.

294
00:21:31,556 --> 00:21:39,773
Boy meets girl, they fall in love with
the music and the stars and the orchestra,

295
00:21:39,856 --> 00:21:42,359
and then they must part.

296
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:54,245
I have no idea what I'm doing.

297
00:21:54,329 --> 00:21:57,540
I can't dance.
I can't even dahnce.

298
00:21:57,624 --> 00:21:59,501
Just smile.

299
00:21:59,584 --> 00:22:04,172
On the balls of your feet.
You're a butterfly.

300
00:22:04,255 --> 00:22:06,132
Does that mean left or right?

301
00:22:06,216 --> 00:22:10,261
Head up, young people, please.
Head up. Up, up.

302
00:22:10,345 --> 00:22:12,847
Head up, young person. Head up.

303
00:22:12,931 --> 00:22:17,227
Kennedy and I have decided to fix you up.
After all, what are brothers for?

304
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:19,813
- I'm healing.
- You're avoiding.

305
00:22:19,896 --> 00:22:24,359
Whenever I call, you're at home
or doing mambo with your landlady.

306
00:22:24,442 --> 00:22:28,571
You've got to get back out there again.
Don't you think so, sweetie?

307
00:22:28,655 --> 00:22:32,325
Absolutely. Honey, I've got to get back.
Nice meeting you.

308
00:22:32,409 --> 00:22:34,285
Yeah, you too.

309
00:22:34,369 --> 00:22:38,581
- So, man, thumbs up, thumbs down?
- She seems nice.

310
00:22:38,665 --> 00:22:42,460
- I'm gonna fix you up.
- I don't wanna be fixed up.

311
00:22:42,544 --> 00:22:45,672
- I have a very nice boyfriend.
- He's a Bolshevik.

312
00:22:45,755 --> 00:22:48,842
- It's not going anywhere.
- Why does it have to go anywhere?

313
00:22:48,925 --> 00:22:53,555
- Because you have to take care of yourself.
- I am taking care of myself.

314
00:22:53,638 --> 00:22:56,016
I just don't need the things that you do.

315
00:22:56,099 --> 00:22:59,519
- You've got to meet this guy.
- What guy?

316
00:22:59,602 --> 00:23:02,814
He's an ear, nose and throat man.

317
00:23:02,897 --> 00:23:05,734
He was just on the cover
of New York magazine.

318
00:23:05,817 --> 00:23:08,486
George, you have to start
taking care of yourself.

319
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:14,325
- I'm taking care of myself.
- Listen. He's an ear, nose and throat man.

320
00:23:16,619 --> 00:23:20,874
But there's nothing wrong with me.
I don't even have a cold.

321
00:23:20,957 --> 00:23:22,417
Yeah... Look...

322
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:27,505
- I have nothing in common with this guy.
- Just have a cup of coffee with him.

323
00:23:27,589 --> 00:23:30,925
I promise you, this is quality goods.

324
00:23:35,638 --> 00:23:37,515
Uh...

325
00:23:39,934 --> 00:23:41,811
- George Hanson?
- Yeah.

326
00:23:41,895 --> 00:23:44,522
Oh, I'm Jonathan Goldstein.

327
00:23:45,023 --> 00:23:50,195
You're adorable. I mean,
your brother's cute, but you're irresistible.

328
00:23:50,278 --> 00:23:53,573
Did anybody ever tell you
you look like a peach?

329
00:23:53,656 --> 00:23:55,450
No.

330
00:23:55,533 --> 00:24:01,331
- So you're an ear, nose and throat man?
- That's my professional life.

331
00:24:02,749 --> 00:24:07,170
I have other interests
that go below the upper torso.

332
00:24:07,253 --> 00:24:08,505
That's...

333
00:24:08,588 --> 00:24:12,384
So I heard you were on the cover
of New York magazine?

334
00:24:12,467 --> 00:24:17,263
Ugh! I got 3,000 new patients
and 6,000 marriage proposals.

335
00:24:18,515 --> 00:24:20,809
And not a single real date.

336
00:24:22,143 --> 00:24:24,020
- Want another drink?
- Yeah.

337
00:24:24,104 --> 00:24:26,189
- Think he's all right?
- Who?

338
00:24:26,272 --> 00:24:30,485
George. He hasn't been on a date in a while.
People can be really creepy.

339
00:24:30,568 --> 00:24:34,489
- Put your zip code right there.
- He's dating a famous doctor.

340
00:24:34,572 --> 00:24:36,658
Señora, firme aquí.

341
00:24:36,741 --> 00:24:38,618
What do we do if he brings him home?

342
00:24:38,702 --> 00:24:42,038
We'll be happy in our room
and they'll be busy in their room.

343
00:24:42,122 --> 00:24:45,250
- Sounds very active.
- Mr Shapiro, you're all done.

344
00:24:45,333 --> 00:24:48,044
Can I touch your nose? It's like a tulip.

345
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:53,508
Mr Shapiro, this woman has a gay roommate
who shows no signs of moving out.

346
00:24:53,591 --> 00:24:58,596
- Big deal. Everyone's gay now.
- You tell him, Mr Shapiro.

347
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,764
Gay?

348
00:24:59,848 --> 00:25:04,269
Sì, señora. Ella comparte
su departamento con un homosexual.

349
00:25:04,352 --> 00:25:06,229
Mi hija es lesbiana.

350
00:25:06,312 --> 00:25:09,524
Yo estoy muy orgullosa de ella.

351
00:25:09,607 --> 00:25:13,445
Oh. Her daughter's a lesbian
and she's very proud.

352
00:25:13,528 --> 00:25:14,779
There you go.

353
00:25:14,863 --> 00:25:20,577
Yo soy la presidenta de
the New York Mothers of Latino Lesbians.

354
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:24,247
Mrs Ochoa is the president of
the New York Mothers of Latino Lesbians.

355
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:27,167
- Well!
- Good for you. You're a good mother.

356
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:29,335
We're queer!
We're here!

357
00:25:29,419 --> 00:25:32,464
Get used to it!
Don't fuck with us!

358
00:25:32,547 --> 00:25:37,093
See, Mr Shapiro, my problem is I love
this woman and I want to live with her.

359
00:25:37,177 --> 00:25:39,429
- You make a living?
- Sure, I'm a lawyer.

360
00:25:39,512 --> 00:25:46,186
Oh! Lawyers are the worst people.
Marry me, honey. I was in children's footwear.

361
00:25:50,774 --> 00:25:54,444
Hello?

362
00:25:55,445 --> 00:25:57,739
- Are you there?
- I'm here.

363
00:26:06,414 --> 00:26:09,709
Hey.

364
00:26:10,418 --> 00:26:12,921
Where's Dr Goldstein?

365
00:26:13,505 --> 00:26:16,216
I don't know. Home.

366
00:26:17,258 --> 00:26:20,303
- I thought maybe...
- Yeah, I thought maybe not.

367
00:26:20,387 --> 00:26:24,474
Oh, um, remind me
to never go on another blind date.

368
00:26:24,557 --> 00:26:26,101
OK.

369
00:26:26,184 --> 00:26:29,396
You don't have to. "Just say no. "

370
00:26:31,147 --> 00:26:33,358
Good night.

371
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,985
Good night.

372
00:27:11,312 --> 00:27:15,191
Step, step, quick, quick.
Step, step, quick, quick.

373
00:27:15,275 --> 00:27:18,820
Slow, slow, quick, quick.
Slow, slow, quick.

374
00:27:18,903 --> 00:27:21,281
Very good. Very good.

375
00:27:21,364 --> 00:27:23,533
Very nice, Sylvia. Excellent.

376
00:27:23,616 --> 00:27:26,578
Very good. Much better. Very good.

377
00:27:26,661 --> 00:27:28,580
No, no, no, no, no.

378
00:27:28,663 --> 00:27:31,291
Head up, young person. Head up.

379
00:27:31,374 --> 00:27:33,543
- Please excuse us.
- Sure.

380
00:27:33,626 --> 00:27:36,212
- Hello, Nina.
- Oh, hi, Danny.

381
00:27:39,299 --> 00:27:41,259
- Help.
- Look at me.

382
00:27:41,343 --> 00:27:43,011
- No, no, no, no.
- Please.

383
00:27:43,094 --> 00:27:45,972
Stop it. Danny, stop touching me.
Madame Reynolds!

384
00:27:46,056 --> 00:27:49,392
T- A-N-G-O.

385
00:27:49,893 --> 00:27:52,604
T- A-N-G-O.

386
00:27:53,021 --> 00:27:55,940
T- A-N-G-O.

387
00:27:56,316 --> 00:27:59,027
T- A-N-G-O.

388
00:27:59,444 --> 00:28:02,197
T- A-N-G-O.

389
00:28:18,838 --> 00:28:21,758
Please get up, young people. Get up.

390
00:28:21,841 --> 00:28:25,011
Now, one, two, side step.

391
00:28:25,095 --> 00:28:26,763
One, two, side step.

392
00:28:26,846 --> 00:28:28,807
Glide, glide.

393
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:32,769
Glide, Danny. Let me see you.

394
00:28:32,852 --> 00:28:37,107
Smile, Mrs Houston.
Let the music carry you away.

395
00:28:44,781 --> 00:28:46,491
Yes!

396
00:28:46,574 --> 00:28:50,286
Quick, quick, step, step.
Quick, quick, step, step.

397
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:52,330
Quick, quick, step, step.

398
00:28:52,414 --> 00:28:55,959
Young people, well done. Well done!

399
00:29:41,921 --> 00:29:44,799
Oh, he's so sexy.

400
00:29:44,883 --> 00:29:46,468
Gene Kelly?

401
00:29:46,551 --> 00:29:48,803
Mm, yeah.

402
00:29:48,887 --> 00:29:50,972
Not my type at all.

403
00:29:51,056 --> 00:29:52,974
What is your type?

404
00:29:53,058 --> 00:29:57,896
- Well, it varies. Depends.
- Who was the first person you slept with?

405
00:29:57,979 --> 00:30:01,566
- Is this 20 Questions?
- What? I wanna know!

406
00:30:01,649 --> 00:30:03,735
Lucy Jane Parnell.

407
00:30:05,737 --> 00:30:09,449
- What?
- Mm. Bellmore High School prom night.

408
00:30:09,532 --> 00:30:11,826
Gave her a real good time.

409
00:30:14,954 --> 00:30:20,126
- You slept with a girl?
- Yeah. Lucy was my high-school girlfriend.

410
00:30:21,961 --> 00:30:23,963
What happened?

411
00:30:26,549 --> 00:30:29,094
Well, I, uh, went to college

412
00:30:29,177 --> 00:30:34,015
and found myself lusting after
the football team more than the cheerleaders,

413
00:30:34,099 --> 00:30:38,019
so I kinda figured I was gay.

414
00:30:39,562 --> 00:30:41,648
What happened to Lucy Jane?

415
00:30:42,357 --> 00:30:47,237
I guess she got married.
Or she runs an insurance company.

416
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,489
I have no idea. I don't...

417
00:30:51,449 --> 00:30:54,369
She was so nice. Mm.

418
00:30:54,452 --> 00:30:59,416
And an unbelievable dancer.
My God, could Lucy tear up the floor.

419
00:31:03,003 --> 00:31:06,464
- Was she pretty?
- Yeah.

420
00:31:06,548 --> 00:31:12,595
She had these big eyes
and this pouty, little mouth.

421
00:31:12,679 --> 00:31:14,556
And her nose...

422
00:31:16,016 --> 00:31:19,894
It was just like a tulip.
I just wanted to touch it.

423
00:31:20,437 --> 00:31:25,150
- It was the most fresh and natural-looking...
- Stop it. Fuck you, George.

424
00:31:25,233 --> 00:31:31,156
- I just wanted to touch it.
- Stop it. No! Don't start. Don't start.

425
00:31:32,866 --> 00:31:37,871
Yesterday we studied Easter. Today we'll
study the Jewish holiday called Passover.

426
00:31:37,954 --> 00:31:40,999
My father's Jewish and
my mother's Buddhist, but New Age.

427
00:31:41,082 --> 00:31:44,419
My mother's Episcopal
and her boyfriend's Ethical Culture.

428
00:31:44,502 --> 00:31:47,172
Both of my parents are Lutheran.

429
00:31:47,255 --> 00:31:50,216
So what? Both of my parents are Reform.

430
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:54,429
My mother's AA
and my father's Christian.

431
00:31:55,764 --> 00:31:57,640
- I'll be right back.
- OK.

432
00:31:59,184 --> 00:32:04,439
- When did you find out?
- About an hour ago.

433
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:08,818
I don't know what to do.
Tell me what to do.

434
00:32:08,902 --> 00:32:10,612
I can't.

435
00:32:10,695 --> 00:32:14,282
Maybe you should talk to Vince.
He is the father.

436
00:32:14,366 --> 00:32:20,580
Vince believes in a woman's right to choose,
as long as he does the choosing.

437
00:32:20,663 --> 00:32:22,582
No.

438
00:32:22,665 --> 00:32:27,045
Can't talk to Vince
until I figure out what I wanna do.

439
00:32:27,128 --> 00:32:30,048
I just need some time to think.

440
00:32:35,929 --> 00:32:38,431
Well, I'm here for you, Nina.

441
00:32:40,934 --> 00:32:44,145
Whatever you need for me to do, I will.

442
00:32:49,859 --> 00:32:53,279
- She hasn't spoken to me in three weeks.
- She's been busy.

443
00:32:53,363 --> 00:32:55,615
She seeing somebody else?

444
00:32:55,699 --> 00:33:00,245
No, no, she's a very beautiful girl.
There's men hitting on her all the time.

445
00:33:00,328 --> 00:33:03,248
There's no one else, Vince.

446
00:33:03,331 --> 00:33:07,877
So, you two still spend
a lot of time together, right?

447
00:33:11,172 --> 00:33:13,550
What sort of things do you do together?

448
00:33:15,969 --> 00:33:21,641
Well, we talk, we go to the movies,
sometimes we go dancing - regular stuff.

449
00:33:22,767 --> 00:33:25,270
You go dancing. Then what?

450
00:33:26,563 --> 00:33:30,984
Then we go home,
we get into bed and watch television.

451
00:33:31,067 --> 00:33:33,111
OK.

452
00:33:33,194 --> 00:33:36,322
But you're not a threat to her.
Is that the attraction?

453
00:33:36,406 --> 00:33:39,075
- I don't know what you mean.
- You know what I mean!

454
00:33:39,159 --> 00:33:42,620
You're not offering her
anything more than friendship.

455
00:33:42,704 --> 00:33:46,166
Of course I'm not offering her
anything more than friendship.

456
00:33:54,132 --> 00:33:56,217
I've made up my mind.

457
00:33:57,552 --> 00:34:00,680
I'll take you wherever you wanna go.

458
00:34:03,475 --> 00:34:05,852
George,

459
00:34:05,935 --> 00:34:08,229
I'm gonna have this baby.

460
00:34:09,481 --> 00:34:11,358
You are?

461
00:34:11,441 --> 00:34:13,318
Yeah.

462
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:21,284
That's great.

463
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:26,164
You're gonna be a wonderful mother.

464
00:34:26,247 --> 00:34:28,333
Lucky baby.

465
00:34:29,584 --> 00:34:34,964
And, Nina, you are going to make
Vince McBride the happiest man alive.

466
00:34:36,174 --> 00:34:38,718
This is so great!

467
00:34:40,053 --> 00:34:46,643
I get to be in charge of all musical education.
Tell Vince I get to pick all the songs.

468
00:34:46,726 --> 00:34:49,646
This is great. This is so great!

469
00:34:50,855 --> 00:34:53,483
- Good decision.
- George, can we go celebrate?

470
00:35:11,459 --> 00:35:15,171
George, would you consider
raising this baby with me?

471
00:35:15,255 --> 00:35:17,132
Of course.

472
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:24,889
I'll be Uncle George.
You're never gonna get rid of me.

473
00:35:24,973 --> 00:35:28,435
Actually, I was thinking
we should keep living together.

474
00:35:28,518 --> 00:35:30,603
Like a family.

475
00:35:31,479 --> 00:35:33,398
What about Vince?

476
00:35:33,481 --> 00:35:39,112
Well, he's the father.
He'll always be in my baby's life.

477
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:43,199
But he's not home to me.

478
00:35:43,283 --> 00:35:45,368
You are.

479
00:35:47,412 --> 00:35:50,874
You can't do that to Vince.

480
00:35:50,957 --> 00:35:57,922
George, my father married somebody wrong
because he thought it was good for me.

481
00:35:58,006 --> 00:36:00,175
I can't do that to my kid. I...

482
00:36:00,258 --> 00:36:04,554
Me and Vince and the baby -
it's a bad equation.

483
00:36:04,637 --> 00:36:09,934
Jesus Christ, Nina. Vince is the father.
You should be with the father of your child.

484
00:36:10,018 --> 00:36:14,147
Don't you see how exciting this could be?

485
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:18,109
You love children. You could raise a child.

486
00:36:18,193 --> 00:36:22,655
I don't wanna marry Vince.
I don't have to marry Vince.

487
00:36:22,739 --> 00:36:24,824
I don't wanna marry you.

488
00:36:29,954 --> 00:36:33,166
George, I'm not proposing marriage.

489
00:36:34,084 --> 00:36:40,507
We can make this up for ourselves.
None of the old rules apply.

490
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:43,093
It's getting late.

491
00:36:43,176 --> 00:36:45,261
We should go.

492
00:36:46,930 --> 00:36:49,516
Won't you even think about it?

493
00:36:52,102 --> 00:36:53,978
Sure.

494
00:36:54,062 --> 00:36:57,023
And I'm very...

495
00:36:58,983 --> 00:37:01,444
You know.

496
00:37:12,205 --> 00:37:16,584
- Hello?
- Nina, darling. We're right around the corner.

497
00:37:16,668 --> 00:37:21,464
We've been to brunch at Norman Mailer's in
Brooklyn Heights so I thought we'd swing by.

498
00:37:21,548 --> 00:37:24,718
- I have to go real bad!
- We're almost there.

499
00:37:24,801 --> 00:37:25,844
She's thrilled.

500
00:37:25,927 --> 00:37:28,430
Fuck! It's Constance.

501
00:37:30,932 --> 00:37:33,727
That can't be them already.

502
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:36,813
- Hey!
- Unbelievable.

503
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:40,608
- Vince, you should have called.
- What good would that have done me?

504
00:37:40,692 --> 00:37:45,864
- Sidney and Constance are coming.
- I got plenty for everybody. Is George here?

505
00:37:45,947 --> 00:37:50,076
- Yes, he's here.
- Good. So the whole gang's together again.

506
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,828
- You look thin.
- I'm fine.

507
00:37:51,911 --> 00:37:54,080
- We need to talk.
- We're talking!

508
00:37:54,164 --> 00:38:00,378
Some more bread. We got the salami, that
prosciutto you love so much, the cheese...

509
00:38:00,462 --> 00:38:05,258
We've got some herring and
we have some deliciously fresh mozzarella.

510
00:38:05,342 --> 00:38:07,635
How many people were you expecting?

511
00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:13,850
More people might've moved into the spare
room. I don't know. She doesn't talk to me.

512
00:38:13,933 --> 00:38:16,811
Any more plates?
Why are Constance and Sidney coming?

513
00:38:16,895 --> 00:38:18,980
I'll get it.

514
00:38:19,064 --> 00:38:21,232
- George!
- Hey, it's the sea witch.

515
00:38:21,316 --> 00:38:25,779
- Is there a party going on upstairs?
- No, we're going to see Nina. You know Nina.

516
00:38:25,862 --> 00:38:28,948
- George, is there a party? Tell me.
- No, there's no party.

517
00:38:29,032 --> 00:38:33,745
- Tell these guests there's no water after 8pm.
- Thank you, Mrs Sarni.

518
00:38:33,828 --> 00:38:36,915
She's terrific. Who needs a doorman
when you have Mrs Sarni?

519
00:38:36,998 --> 00:38:41,670
- Just hurry up and get inside.
- I really envy your living here, George.

520
00:38:41,753 --> 00:38:47,050
What do you need with a dining room,
butlers, dinner parties? It's all a big headache.

521
00:38:47,133 --> 00:38:50,470
Styron lived in a place like this
when he wrote Sophie's Choice.

522
00:38:50,553 --> 00:38:52,222
What are you talking about?

523
00:38:52,305 --> 00:38:55,308
- Hi. Can I go?
- It's hot. It's like August already.

524
00:38:55,392 --> 00:38:59,896
Hiya, sweetheart. How do you get through
summer without air conditioning?

525
00:38:59,979 --> 00:39:03,441
- Hey, Vinnie!
- Hey, Sidney. Come eat, huh?

526
00:39:03,525 --> 00:39:06,486
Ooh, this looks good.
So, who you defending now?

527
00:39:06,569 --> 00:39:10,907
A couple of kids who got framed
on a rape and battery charge in the Bronx.

528
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:16,705
Defend somebody big, whether you win or
lose, I'll get you $2 million on the book deal.

529
00:39:16,788 --> 00:39:20,917
- By the way, you don't even have to write it.
- I'm not in show business.

530
00:39:21,001 --> 00:39:25,046
Most lawyers aren't averse to publicity.
You should think about Court TV.

531
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:29,592
- He doesn't wanna think about Court TV.
- Wonderful food. I could eat like this daily.

532
00:39:29,676 --> 00:39:33,304
- No herring, or I'll hear about it all night.
- What will you hear?

533
00:39:33,388 --> 00:39:36,016
- Sally, go wash your hands.
- I'll take her.

534
00:39:36,099 --> 00:39:39,894
- Where have you been?
- You haven't been calling Constance either?

535
00:39:39,978 --> 00:39:44,941
- How d'you survive without her great advice?
- She talks to me every day. We're very close.

536
00:39:45,025 --> 00:39:49,863
- I swear, I'm hotter than a goat in China.
- Can we get some air in here?

537
00:39:49,946 --> 00:39:54,242
- What are you hiding from us?
- Did you finally break up? I'm proud of you!

538
00:39:54,325 --> 00:39:57,203
Nobody has broken up.
Mind your own business.

539
00:39:57,287 --> 00:40:00,832
- Can you get food poisoning this fast?
- Do you have air con?

540
00:40:00,915 --> 00:40:04,210
- I will get the fan!
- Wait. You shouldn't lift stuff like that.

541
00:40:04,294 --> 00:40:06,463
Why not?

542
00:40:06,546 --> 00:40:09,674
I'm fine. Nothing is wrong with me.

543
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:15,597
- What the fuck is going on?
- Don't speak that way in front of my child.

544
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:18,850
- Betty, it's time we got home.
- Betty was your other wife.

545
00:40:18,933 --> 00:40:22,354
- I'm Constance. Remember?
- Oh, Christ.

546
00:40:22,437 --> 00:40:24,481
- Are you sleeping with her?
- I'm gay.

547
00:40:24,564 --> 00:40:28,526
- You are?
- And it's a valid and wonderful choice.

548
00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:32,364
Sidney, shut up.
George, what is going on here?

549
00:40:34,199 --> 00:40:36,951
Are you pregnant?

550
00:40:37,035 --> 00:40:39,829
Oh, my God. You're pregnant.

551
00:40:39,913 --> 00:40:43,625
- George! What's going on?
- Who's the father?

552
00:40:43,708 --> 00:40:46,628
You son of a bitch,
you couldn't keep your hands off her!

553
00:40:46,711 --> 00:40:51,549
- Vince! Calm down. It's your baby.
- I want New York Hospital, emergency room.

554
00:40:51,633 --> 00:40:54,052
- It's mine?
- And mine.

555
00:40:55,512 --> 00:40:57,597
It's mine. It's mine.

556
00:40:59,474 --> 00:41:01,851
I want a real, big doctor.

557
00:41:01,935 --> 00:41:04,938
George, is everything all right there? George!

558
00:41:05,021 --> 00:41:08,983
- Will you get that? I can't hear a thing.
- Are you OK? Are you hungry?

559
00:41:09,067 --> 00:41:12,904
I need someone in the
gastrointestinal department. George!

560
00:41:12,987 --> 00:41:15,615
- What the hell is going on?!
- Hello?

561
00:41:16,616 --> 00:41:19,911
Everything's fine, Mrs Sarni.

562
00:41:19,994 --> 00:41:23,331
I thought someone died
and hit the floor. Jesus.

563
00:41:23,415 --> 00:41:27,127
- Sweetie, give me the phone.
- Oh, God. Open the windows.

564
00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:30,922
Daddy, you never
should have ate that herring.

565
00:41:31,006 --> 00:41:34,968
Fan me with something. Is that The
New Yorker? Fan me with The New Yorker.

566
00:41:35,051 --> 00:41:37,971
You're well out of this.
It sounds crazy.

567
00:41:38,054 --> 00:41:43,560
I haven't even seen her recently because she's
always at Vince's, which is definitely right,

568
00:41:43,643 --> 00:41:47,689
but what does that say about our friendship?
Maybe I didn't mean much to her.

569
00:41:47,772 --> 00:41:51,067
George, you sound like
you're talking about your ex-lover.

570
00:41:51,151 --> 00:41:55,864
Everything is about sex with you. You can get
close to a woman without sleeping with her.

571
00:41:55,947 --> 00:41:58,241
Really? That's news to me.

572
00:42:00,493 --> 00:42:03,705
I'm sure Vince isn't letting her
come anywhere near me.

573
00:42:03,788 --> 00:42:08,209
I should have been more open.
It could have really been exciting.

574
00:42:08,293 --> 00:42:12,714
Yeah, sure, it could have been exciting.
Bottom line is she wanted to fuck you.

575
00:42:12,797 --> 00:42:17,385
- That's insane.
- Look, we're both cute, and I know women.

576
00:42:17,469 --> 00:42:23,391
They tell you they wanna be your friend, but
they're really wanting... to fuck you.

577
00:42:23,475 --> 00:42:27,896
I'm gonna probably have to move out
cos she'll want to get rid of the apartment,

578
00:42:27,979 --> 00:42:29,939
so I hoped I could crash at your place.

579
00:42:30,023 --> 00:42:31,066
Yes.

580
00:42:31,149 --> 00:42:34,361
- Hey, honey.
- Hey! Hi.

581
00:42:34,444 --> 00:42:40,033
You've not met my new fiancée.
Suni, George. This is my brother George.

582
00:42:40,116 --> 00:42:42,660
- George, this is Suni from Surgery.
- Hi.

583
00:42:47,666 --> 00:42:51,002
Where'd it go? Oh, there it goes.

584
00:42:52,671 --> 00:42:54,756
Thanks.

585
00:42:58,051 --> 00:43:01,096
OK, ready? Stand up.
Now you're gonna hit a knee, right?

586
00:43:01,179 --> 00:43:03,598
- Yep.
- OK.

587
00:43:03,682 --> 00:43:06,309
Attaboy. Block with your body.

588
00:43:06,393 --> 00:43:09,688
And then take a step... There you go.

589
00:43:09,771 --> 00:43:13,483
- Ready?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Wait, stop right there.

590
00:43:13,566 --> 00:43:17,987
Face me like you're gonna do the pitch.
Ready?

591
00:43:18,071 --> 00:43:19,948
Slow-mo.

592
00:43:20,031 --> 00:43:23,493
- Nice. Come right over the top with it.
- Got it.

593
00:43:23,576 --> 00:43:26,496
You did it great last week. Again.

594
00:43:27,706 --> 00:43:29,833
OK, try it again.

595
00:43:29,916 --> 00:43:32,419
Now, come right over the top.

596
00:43:34,921 --> 00:43:36,381
Attaboy!

597
00:43:59,821 --> 00:44:04,951
At first the iodine
does not affect the vitamin C solution.

598
00:44:05,035 --> 00:44:07,662
But look what happens if I add some more.

599
00:44:09,914 --> 00:44:12,917
This process is called titration.

600
00:44:16,504 --> 00:44:20,884
- Is there nothing that little girl can't do?
- Watch TV. She's lousy at that.

601
00:44:20,967 --> 00:44:22,844
- Doug!
- Hi, Sidney. How you doin'?

602
00:44:22,927 --> 00:44:25,347
George, my Uncle Jonathan
says he knows you.

603
00:44:25,430 --> 00:44:28,892
He does? Let's go, Nathan.
Greatjob, Mary.

604
00:44:28,975 --> 00:44:33,271
Hey, George. Do you recognise me
in my ear, nose and throat gear?

605
00:44:33,355 --> 00:44:36,024
- Free next weekend? I know a great club.
- George!

606
00:44:36,107 --> 00:44:41,363
Oh, I see a friend of mine.
It was great to see you. Thanks for coming.

607
00:44:41,446 --> 00:44:46,034
- What are you doing here?
- I promised Sally I'd come.

608
00:44:46,785 --> 00:44:50,622
- It's so good to see you.
- You too. How you doin', Vince?

609
00:44:50,705 --> 00:44:54,542
We almost didn't make it.
First trimester's got us a little queasy.

610
00:44:54,626 --> 00:44:59,297
- Vince has become an expert on pregnancy.
- I'm lovin' it. You should visit us.

611
00:44:59,381 --> 00:45:03,468
Vince, we are not an official "us".
There is still you and there is still me.

612
00:45:03,551 --> 00:45:05,762
OK.

613
00:45:05,845 --> 00:45:08,014
He's like glue.

614
00:45:08,098 --> 00:45:12,352
- Madame Reynolds asked for you last week.
- Oh, I would love to go dancing.

615
00:45:12,435 --> 00:45:16,398
- Just don't exhaust yourself.
- George, when's the trophy presentation?

616
00:45:16,481 --> 00:45:19,818
- 20 minutes.
- The trophy presentation?

617
00:45:19,901 --> 00:45:24,447
What happened to "It's not about winning,
it's about how you play the game"?

618
00:45:24,531 --> 00:45:28,118
There shouldn't be any trophies.
It's the parents who want them.

619
00:45:28,201 --> 00:45:32,622
It's what's ruining this country - the
obsession with being number one starts here.

620
00:45:32,706 --> 00:45:36,001
I hear you. I try to teach
these kids a sense of community.

621
00:45:36,084 --> 00:45:39,546
You can't do that.
These parents are natural-born killers.

622
00:45:39,629 --> 00:45:44,592
Vince, that is such bullshit. I don't know
anyone who is more competitive than you.

623
00:45:44,676 --> 00:45:47,846
Did I say anything was wrong
with striving for excellence?

624
00:45:47,929 --> 00:45:49,806
- Jesus Christ!
- No.

625
00:45:49,889 --> 00:45:53,435
At least somebody appreciates
what I'm saying. What's your name?

626
00:45:53,518 --> 00:45:57,147
- Melissa Marx...
- I'm gonna lose it. Just get me out of here.

627
00:45:57,230 --> 00:46:01,693
Ooh!

628
00:46:01,776 --> 00:46:05,113
- You're right.
- I didn't ask him to come.

629
00:46:05,196 --> 00:46:08,199
You're absolutely right.
It's not gonna work.

630
00:46:08,283 --> 00:46:14,247
By the way, we're both pregnant. First, we get
sick together, then we throw up together,

631
00:46:14,331 --> 00:46:17,459
then we get our fucking sonograms together!

632
00:46:17,542 --> 00:46:21,129
Nina, it's a bad equation -
you, Vince and the baby. Bad for all of you.

633
00:46:21,212 --> 00:46:26,760
- No shit, Sherlock!
- You made me an offer and I never refused.

634
00:46:26,843 --> 00:46:27,886
What?

635
00:46:32,265 --> 00:46:38,438
I spent all yesterday afternoon watching
this little kid play catch with his father.

636
00:46:38,563 --> 00:46:42,067
I always thought that
I could teach other people's children,

637
00:46:42,192 --> 00:46:49,991
but someone else, you know, a real guy
like Vince gets to take them home.

638
00:46:51,618 --> 00:46:57,624
Then I thought I don't always have to be
the one who's watching them leave.

639
00:46:57,707 --> 00:47:04,756
I don't always have to be the one
who waits for twilight to pass.

640
00:47:07,342 --> 00:47:14,641
For the first time I thought
I could be the guy who says good night.

641
00:47:22,482 --> 00:47:24,442
What are you saying to me?

642
00:47:27,362 --> 00:47:29,406
I'm saying "Yeah".

643
00:47:44,921 --> 00:47:48,967
Sorry to break this up,
but it's time to go home.

644
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:55,015
Um...

645
00:47:55,098 --> 00:47:59,644
I'm not gonna home with you, Vince.
I'm gonna go back to Brooklyn.

646
00:47:59,728 --> 00:48:03,898
You can't go back to Brooklyn. We got
a doctor's appointment in the morning.

647
00:48:03,982 --> 00:48:09,112
No. We don't have a doctor's appointment.
I have a doctor's appointment.

648
00:48:09,237 --> 00:48:14,367
Fine. OK, you have an appointment.
You're getting caught up in nonsense, Nina.

649
00:48:14,451 --> 00:48:18,121
- OK, Vince, this isn't working.
- Could we talk about this later?

650
00:48:18,204 --> 00:48:20,749
- No! We need to talk about it now.
- In front of him?

651
00:48:20,874 --> 00:48:27,297
Yeah. Vince, I have tried to talk to you
in private. You don't listen to me.

652
00:48:29,591 --> 00:48:31,634
George...

653
00:48:32,427 --> 00:48:36,264
This is between me and Nina.
You've done enough to fuck us up. Get out.

654
00:48:36,431 --> 00:48:39,517
This is my school.
You don't get to tell me what to do.

655
00:48:39,642 --> 00:48:42,979
Nothing has been the same
between me and Nina since you showed up.

656
00:48:43,063 --> 00:48:46,733
- Does that make you happy?
- Vince, just listen to me...

657
00:48:46,858 --> 00:48:54,491
No, you listen to me. You don't see this guy
for who he is. He's a troublemaking little shit.

658
00:48:54,574 --> 00:48:57,285
Vince...

659
00:48:57,369 --> 00:49:02,165
I wanna raise my child with George.

660
00:49:08,338 --> 00:49:09,798
Oh.

661
00:49:10,757 --> 00:49:12,008
Oh.

662
00:49:12,092 --> 00:49:16,137
You know what?
I wanna raise it with the man in the moon.

663
00:49:16,221 --> 00:49:19,974
For once, why don't you just goddamn listen
to what she has to say?

664
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:24,187
- Hey! Vince, just calm down.
- No, I will not calm down!

665
00:49:26,231 --> 00:49:30,068
You have some nerve, you homo boys.

666
00:49:30,151 --> 00:49:37,283
You screw up women's personal lives, but
can't take any physical responsibility for it.

667
00:49:37,367 --> 00:49:39,828
Listen to me. No.

668
00:49:39,953 --> 00:49:44,666
When this kid comes to you
and asks you who its father is,

669
00:49:44,749 --> 00:49:51,256
you tell it that its father never wanted
to lay eyes on its mother ever again.

670
00:50:10,734 --> 00:50:13,194
Head up, young person.

671
00:50:25,248 --> 00:50:28,668
Would you like to hear the heartbeat?

672
00:50:28,752 --> 00:50:31,880
- Can I?
- Yeah, sure.

673
00:50:58,114 --> 00:51:00,158
It's amazing.

674
00:51:07,332 --> 00:51:09,376
Come on.

675
00:51:21,596 --> 00:51:23,306
George Hanson.

676
00:51:23,390 --> 00:51:25,433
Steve Casillo?!

677
00:51:30,021 --> 00:51:32,399
Wow!

678
00:51:32,482 --> 00:51:36,236
- You're not someone I'd expect to see in here.
- Uh, yeah, uh...

679
00:51:36,361 --> 00:51:39,864
- Oh, this is my friend Nina Borowski.
- Yeah, I can see that.

680
00:51:39,948 --> 00:51:44,494
- Hi.
- No, she's my friend. Friend.

681
00:51:44,619 --> 00:51:47,372
She's expecting.

682
00:51:47,455 --> 00:51:51,376
- I can give you a discount on this one.
- Oh, just browsing.

683
00:51:51,459 --> 00:51:54,796
Yeah, we're...

684
00:51:55,839 --> 00:51:58,299
Feel free to look around.

685
00:52:00,969 --> 00:52:02,429
OK.

686
00:52:07,934 --> 00:52:09,978
Small world.

687
00:52:10,729 --> 00:52:11,730
Wow.

688
00:52:12,647 --> 00:52:15,108
- Lemonade?
- Thanks.

689
00:52:16,317 --> 00:52:19,738
- The Hampton benefit season's in full swing...
- Oh, my God.

690
00:52:19,821 --> 00:52:21,698
...at Sidney Miller's house.

691
00:52:21,781 --> 00:52:27,120
Guests included Anne Rice, King Hussein
and Colin Powell. Hot fun in the summertime.

692
00:52:27,203 --> 00:52:32,584
- So how come we weren't invited?
- Thank God we weren't invited! Oh!

693
00:52:34,586 --> 00:52:36,880
Who was that man in the crib store today?

694
00:52:37,005 --> 00:52:41,426
Just someone I had a fling with
before I met Joley.

695
00:52:45,472 --> 00:52:47,766
You know,

696
00:52:47,891 --> 00:52:52,604
if you ever wanted to invite him here,
that would be fine.

697
00:52:53,730 --> 00:52:57,233
- Mm-mm.
- I could sleep in your room.

698
00:53:01,279 --> 00:53:05,116
What if I said "That's a great idea,
he'll be right over"?

699
00:53:08,036 --> 00:53:10,080
I'd say "Great".

700
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:14,501
This isn't a marriage.

701
00:53:14,626 --> 00:53:18,129
I don't wanna make you give up your life.

702
00:53:19,172 --> 00:53:21,466
You're not.

703
00:53:22,842 --> 00:53:25,053
Great.

704
00:53:27,222 --> 00:53:31,059
- So, are you gonna call him?
- I'm leaving with him for Paris tonight.

705
00:53:31,601 --> 00:53:34,062
- You are?
- Oh, God!

706
00:53:38,441 --> 00:53:42,821
- I just hate secrets, George.
- What secrets? I tell you everything.

707
00:53:44,531 --> 00:53:48,451
Just promise that if anything in your life
changes, that you'll tell me.

708
00:53:48,576 --> 00:53:54,833
Nothing's gonna change.
I'm not going anywhere. This isn't temporary.

709
00:53:58,878 --> 00:54:03,591
- Don't you miss men?
- Yeah, sure. Sometimes.

710
00:54:03,675 --> 00:54:05,969
Don't you?

711
00:54:06,094 --> 00:54:08,138
I guess.

712
00:54:09,556 --> 00:54:12,892
But I don't miss them when I'm with you.

713
00:54:23,111 --> 00:54:27,532
D'you think most married couples
are as happy as we are?

714
00:54:27,615 --> 00:54:31,661
I hope so, cos we're pretty happy.

715
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:38,710
I guess sex is just no big deal.

716
00:54:40,503 --> 00:54:42,964
Not even with Lucy Jane?

717
00:54:44,924 --> 00:54:47,802
I just adore you, Nina. I really do.

718
00:54:47,886 --> 00:54:49,929
I adore you, too.

719
00:56:49,507 --> 00:56:50,759
Yeah?

720
00:56:50,842 --> 00:56:53,053
George, hi.

721
00:56:53,136 --> 00:56:55,430
It's Joley.

722
00:56:55,555 --> 00:56:57,182
How are you?

723
00:57:02,145 --> 00:57:04,439
Look, um,

724
00:57:04,522 --> 00:57:10,028
I know that it's been a long time,
but, well, I told you that I'd call

725
00:57:10,111 --> 00:57:12,322
and, uh...

726
00:57:12,405 --> 00:57:15,492
Oh, God. These things are so weird.

727
00:57:15,575 --> 00:57:17,869
I guess.

728
00:57:17,952 --> 00:57:19,412
Who is it?

729
00:57:20,497 --> 00:57:23,750
Uh, my brother.

730
00:57:23,833 --> 00:57:26,294
George, are you still there?

731
00:57:28,004 --> 00:57:30,465
Yeah. Nina says hello.

732
00:57:31,424 --> 00:57:32,676
Oh.

733
00:57:32,759 --> 00:57:38,640
I was so sure you'd be with someone by now.
That's really why I haven't called.

734
00:57:40,058 --> 00:57:44,938
- Yeah, Nina's still here.
- George, it's so good to hear your voice.

735
00:57:46,773 --> 00:57:51,152
I'm surprised you'd even talk to me.
I behaved like an idiot.

736
00:57:51,277 --> 00:57:55,657
I'm addressing a critics' convention
at your old college the weekend after next.

737
00:57:55,740 --> 00:58:00,453
And I've been thinking about
that time we drove up there.

738
00:58:00,578 --> 00:58:05,083
That was our first Christmas together.
You remember?

739
00:58:06,501 --> 00:58:09,921
So you want me to come with you?

740
00:58:10,005 --> 00:58:11,881
That's very considerate of you.

741
00:58:11,965 --> 00:58:17,429
I wouldn't be surprised if you never
wanted to lay eyes on me again, but...

742
00:58:17,512 --> 00:58:22,726
it would really mean a lot to me,
just to be with you.

743
00:58:24,019 --> 00:58:28,565
I made a reservation
at that sweet little inn we stayed at.

744
00:58:29,858 --> 00:58:33,611
Well, I'll call you if I can make it.

745
00:58:33,695 --> 00:58:35,572
I think about you all the time.

746
00:58:35,655 --> 00:58:41,453
And, for what it's worth, I really miss you.

747
00:58:41,536 --> 00:58:45,290
Yeah. Thank you.
I'll talk to you soon.

748
00:58:53,173 --> 00:58:55,550
Where does he want you to go?

749
00:58:58,511 --> 00:59:00,555
My college.

750
00:59:04,142 --> 00:59:06,186
For a reunion?

751
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:09,564
Sort of.

752
00:59:11,608 --> 00:59:14,527
Nina, that was, uh... Joley.

753
00:59:24,496 --> 00:59:26,539
So, are you gonna go?

754
00:59:27,749 --> 00:59:29,417
I don't know.

755
00:59:31,544 --> 00:59:34,464
That usually means yes.

756
00:59:36,174 --> 00:59:38,718
I hate that you know me so well.

757
00:59:45,934 --> 00:59:47,977
- Hi.
- Hey.

758
00:59:51,606 --> 00:59:53,650
You look great.

759
00:59:54,859 --> 00:59:56,903
I love this.

760
00:59:59,072 --> 01:00:02,993
- I'll call you at Constance's tomorrow.
- Promise?

761
01:00:04,035 --> 01:00:05,704
I promise.

762
01:00:05,787 --> 01:00:08,873
- What time?
- Early. I promise.

763
01:00:11,751 --> 01:00:15,338
Ordinarily I wouldn't go to conferences,
but they insisted I come,

764
01:00:15,463 --> 01:00:19,050
and I guess it never hurts
to stay on the good side of reviewers.

765
01:00:19,134 --> 01:00:23,138
Oh, my book! Did I tell you my book
is coming out in paperback in England?

766
01:00:23,221 --> 01:00:28,601
It's very impressive for an American
Shaw scholar to do so well in Europe.

767
01:00:33,106 --> 01:00:35,150
You OK, honey?

768
01:00:37,318 --> 01:00:40,030
How did we get back so quickly
to the "honey" stage?

769
01:00:40,113 --> 01:00:42,324
Maybe we never should've left it.

770
01:00:51,458 --> 01:00:57,255
- So, how's your student?
- Back with his girlfriend. He's screwed up.

771
01:00:57,339 --> 01:00:59,716
So you wanna be friends now?
Just so I know.

772
01:00:59,841 --> 01:01:02,802
- That is exactly your problem, George.
- What?

773
01:01:02,886 --> 01:01:09,142
Your lack of self-worth. You have
no idea how important you are to me.

774
01:01:11,227 --> 01:01:12,729
Thank you.

775
01:01:12,812 --> 01:01:15,106
So, I've been thinking about you a lot.

776
01:01:15,231 --> 01:01:21,237
You're living with a woman in a dump
in Brooklyn, and I'm lonely and missing you.

777
01:01:21,363 --> 01:01:23,823
We can do better than that.

778
01:01:23,948 --> 01:01:26,159
- Nina!
- Hi.

779
01:01:26,242 --> 01:01:30,955
- You missed Spielberg and Peter Jennings.
- Oh, I bet they sent their best regards.

780
01:01:31,081 --> 01:01:34,918
Sweetie, don't start the weekend like this.
What are you wearing?

781
01:01:35,001 --> 01:01:39,255
- Ai! Hello, honey. How are you?
- Good.

782
01:01:39,339 --> 01:01:43,009
- Where's George?
- With his old boyfriend - where he should be.

783
01:01:43,134 --> 01:01:45,679
Constance, he's not with his old boyfriend.

784
01:01:45,762 --> 01:01:50,016
- You told me he went away with Dr Joley.
- Doesn't mean he's with him.

785
01:01:50,100 --> 01:01:52,143
Sally, sit down and buckle up.

786
01:01:52,268 --> 01:01:58,066
I want you to relax this weekend. Take walks,
eat well, let Sidney and me take care of you.

787
01:01:58,149 --> 01:02:00,193
- And me.
- And Sally.

788
01:02:00,318 --> 01:02:06,074
We're gonna have a nice, relaxing dinner.
Just old friends, and Stephen Saint is coming.

789
01:02:06,199 --> 01:02:11,871
You'll never believe it. He's just dying to see
you. You made quite an impression on him.

790
01:02:19,170 --> 01:02:23,091
- Hello. Dr Robert Joley.
- Ah, yes. Dr Joley.

791
01:02:23,216 --> 01:02:26,136
We have you down for three nights
and a king-size bed.

792
01:02:26,219 --> 01:02:29,055
- Twin beds.
- I don't know I have a room with...

793
01:02:29,139 --> 01:02:34,436
- We'll take the king.
- I have twin beds. I'd be happy to exchange.

794
01:02:34,519 --> 01:02:36,396
- You sure, Mrs Skinner?
- Surely.

795
01:02:36,479 --> 01:02:41,609
- Thank you, Mrs Skinner.
- No sense in you being on top of each other.

796
01:02:41,735 --> 01:02:45,071
- Right at the head of the stairs.
- Thank you.

797
01:02:45,196 --> 01:02:47,407
I thought we had the discount rate.

798
01:02:47,532 --> 01:02:50,869
That is the discount rate.
Through the dining room.

799
01:02:50,952 --> 01:02:55,040
- Dr Joley, I presume.
- Well, Rodney Fraser.

800
01:02:55,123 --> 01:02:57,792
You're one of the reasons
I agreed to come here.

801
01:02:57,876 --> 01:03:01,629
Thank you.
I see you've lost none of your charm.

802
01:03:01,713 --> 01:03:06,259
- Congratulations on George Bernard Shaw.
- Thank you.

803
01:03:06,343 --> 01:03:11,222
Such a treat to read
an American perspective on the subject.

804
01:03:13,350 --> 01:03:17,812
Oh, this is Paul James. Dr Robert Joley.
Have I met your friend?

805
01:03:17,896 --> 01:03:21,816
- George Hanson.
- How do you do? Paul James.

806
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:24,903
- You in the theatre?
- No, a graduate of our host college.

807
01:03:24,986 --> 01:03:27,447
Really? "The return of the native".

808
01:03:28,782 --> 01:03:32,911
Well, look forward to seeing you both
around the campus, hm? Bye.

809
01:03:32,994 --> 01:03:35,038
- Bye-bye.
- See you.

810
01:03:36,790 --> 01:03:39,709
I wonder if Mrs Rodney charges by the hour.

811
01:03:39,793 --> 01:03:44,422
Let me tell you, when my first wife
left me she wanted to take my clients.

812
01:03:44,547 --> 01:03:49,177
I understand the house, the car,
but my clients?

813
01:03:49,260 --> 01:03:56,351
You know, since we last met, I've done
some heavy therapy and taken up yoga.

814
01:03:56,434 --> 01:03:58,978
- And I quit advertising.
- Mm.

815
01:03:59,062 --> 01:04:06,027
So I know this might seem premature,
but I'm ready to be the father of your child.

816
01:04:22,043 --> 01:04:23,712
Good night.

817
01:04:37,058 --> 01:04:38,935
Good night.

818
01:04:39,060 --> 01:04:43,440
And our thanks to Mrs Gutierrez
for an interesting question

819
01:04:43,523 --> 01:04:47,694
and a spirited response from the panel.

820
01:04:47,777 --> 01:04:54,284
And now we move on to, um...
oh, another question from Mrs Gutierrez.

821
01:04:54,409 --> 01:04:57,412
Oh, yes. How do you feel about
great works of literature

822
01:04:57,537 --> 01:05:00,332
being transformed into musical comedy?

823
01:05:00,415 --> 01:05:05,211
That sounds like one for
our academic colleague. Professor?

824
01:05:05,337 --> 01:05:09,257
Well, um, I should begin by saying that

825
01:05:09,341 --> 01:05:13,094
I think My Fair Lady
is a complete distortion of Shaw's Pygmalion,

826
01:05:13,178 --> 01:05:16,056
as is West Side Story of Romeo and Juliet.

827
01:05:16,139 --> 01:05:18,183
But then I hate all musicals.

828
01:05:18,308 --> 01:05:25,940
I believe they're middlebrow,
populist and frankly dangerous.

829
01:05:26,983 --> 01:05:29,194
So it's a clean sweep from Dr Joley.

830
01:05:30,654 --> 01:05:33,531
I have seen shows
in cross-gender clubs in Berlin

831
01:05:33,615 --> 01:05:39,245
that has far more theatrical impact
than anything I have ever seen on Broadway.

832
01:05:39,329 --> 01:05:44,376
- You mean women dipped in chocolate?
- I am talking about serious artists.

833
01:05:44,459 --> 01:05:49,589
I have never recovered from Ulrika Schinkel's
brilliant production of Beethoven in Bondage,

834
01:05:49,714 --> 01:05:51,925
set amongst the ruins of the Reichstag.

835
01:05:52,050 --> 01:05:57,389
Something that may interest you, Rodney, is
German theatres are filled with young people.

836
01:05:57,472 --> 01:06:01,559
Nina! Mommy says
we're all taking a picnic on the beach.

837
01:06:01,643 --> 01:06:06,690
- Oh, honey, I'm waiting for a phone call.
- Mommy, Nina's waiting for a phone call.

838
01:06:06,815 --> 01:06:09,359
Sally, go get your father. Go.

839
01:06:10,652 --> 01:06:15,365
- I'll come down later, I promise.
- Jesus Christ, you're always moping.

840
01:06:15,490 --> 01:06:20,704
- You're a guest here. Make an effort.
- I have made an effort. Stephen loved me.

841
01:06:20,829 --> 01:06:24,165
I hope you realise he's currently
in bed with his old boyfriend.

842
01:06:24,290 --> 01:06:28,044
- Who, Stephen?
- The man whose call you're waiting for.

843
01:06:28,128 --> 01:06:32,048
You know, I enjoy gay people.

844
01:06:32,173 --> 01:06:35,760
I just have a problem with my sister
being in love with one of them.

845
01:06:35,885 --> 01:06:38,179
I am not in love with him.

846
01:06:38,263 --> 01:06:42,809
Even when I was desperate to marry Sidney,
I never carried on like you. And he's straight.

847
01:06:42,934 --> 01:06:47,480
But this is an even crazier choice
than Vincent. You're not even fucking him!

848
01:06:53,528 --> 01:06:55,196
Can I ask you something?

849
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:58,533
When was the last time
you and Sidney had sex?

850
01:06:58,658 --> 01:07:03,288
- That is not the point.
- Exactly! Doesn't it all turn into friendship?

851
01:07:03,371 --> 01:07:07,667
Yes, but normal people start out someplace
you and teacher are never gonna get.

852
01:07:07,751 --> 01:07:12,005
- Look at yourself. You're a psychiatrist.
- I am a social worker, Constance!

853
01:07:12,088 --> 01:07:15,425
Oh! Will you just let me live my goddamn life!

854
01:07:15,550 --> 01:07:20,263
Read my lips. George is G-A-Y.

855
01:07:20,347 --> 01:07:23,224
Gay! That means
he never sleeps with women.

856
01:07:23,308 --> 01:07:26,394
- He has slept with a woman.
- What?

857
01:07:28,021 --> 01:07:33,151
- Lucy Jane Parnell.
- Oh, please. Don't tell me. In high school?

858
01:07:33,234 --> 01:07:35,528
They all try women once in high school,

859
01:07:35,612 --> 01:07:40,075
but you're nutty enough to believe that based
on that, you can bring him to his senses.

860
01:07:40,158 --> 01:07:44,704
A gay nursery-school teacher
is a one-way ticket to nowhere.

861
01:07:45,830 --> 01:07:48,041
I'd love to go to a place like this -

862
01:07:48,375 --> 01:07:51,378
read, sleep, have great talks, sex...

863
01:07:51,461 --> 01:07:55,840
Well, we didn't actually have much of that.
We did talk about it a lot.

864
01:07:55,924 --> 01:07:58,718
- Did you act at all?
- Me? No, not really.

865
01:07:58,802 --> 01:08:03,348
- You an actor?
- Well, trying to be. That's how I met Rodney.

866
01:08:03,431 --> 01:08:08,395
- I sat in on his world theatre class.
- What's his take on world theatre?

867
01:08:08,520 --> 01:08:14,526
Well, Rodney's very picky. He likes Damn
Yankees and Shakespeare - butjust to read.

868
01:08:14,609 --> 01:08:18,196
He's never seen a production
up to his standards.

869
01:08:19,739 --> 01:08:23,410
Don't you get flak from your actor friends
being with a critic?

870
01:08:23,535 --> 01:08:28,832
Well, I've never been with him with him. It's
just that he came up to me one day after class

871
01:08:28,915 --> 01:08:32,502
and he's been sort of like my mentor
and my family ever since.

872
01:08:32,585 --> 01:08:35,797
Oh, I thought maybe
you lived together. I'm sorry.

873
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:41,094
We do live together. He offered me a room
so I can save my money for acting lessons.

874
01:08:41,177 --> 01:08:44,931
Well, I've always had
terrible judgment.

875
01:08:45,015 --> 01:08:49,185
My entire freshman year I had a crush
on a guy named Trotter Bull the Third.

876
01:08:51,354 --> 01:08:55,900
- He looked just like one of those rowers.
- Looks like pretty good judgment to me.

877
01:08:55,984 --> 01:08:57,652
Except he had a girlfriend.

878
01:08:57,736 --> 01:09:02,282
I actually got up the courage to talk to him
one night about Walt Whitman.

879
01:09:03,366 --> 01:09:07,996
He probably became an investment banker,
had four kids, all named Trotter,

880
01:09:08,079 --> 01:09:11,249
and never talked about poetry again.

881
01:09:15,587 --> 01:09:18,214
I'll talk to you about poetry.

882
01:09:20,925 --> 01:09:22,594
Sure. Any time.

883
01:09:23,928 --> 01:09:24,929
How about a swim?

884
01:09:25,055 --> 01:09:27,724
- Whoo!
- Wait for me!

885
01:09:27,807 --> 01:09:29,684
Hey!

886
01:09:35,565 --> 01:09:37,525
I've got it. It's for me. Sorry.

887
01:09:37,609 --> 01:09:39,486
Hello.

888
01:09:40,528 --> 01:09:42,822
No, she's at the beach.

889
01:09:44,449 --> 01:09:48,286
Uh-huh.
It's Martha Stewart for Mrs Miller.

890
01:09:48,370 --> 01:09:51,373
- Yes?
- Is it the Martha Stewart?

891
01:09:51,498 --> 01:09:52,957
Yes.

892
01:09:53,041 --> 01:09:55,502
Oh, will you hold on, please?

893
01:09:56,336 --> 01:10:01,132
Miss Stewart, I'm having
a big problem with my azaleas.

894
01:10:03,510 --> 01:10:04,761
Uh-huh.

895
01:10:04,844 --> 01:10:09,224
- Do I see you again?
- I hope so.

896
01:10:09,307 --> 01:10:11,976
When do I call you?

897
01:10:12,060 --> 01:10:13,728
Oh, fuck.

898
01:10:13,812 --> 01:10:17,232
My roommate. I was supposed
to call her this morning. Shit!

899
01:10:17,315 --> 01:10:20,318
- Your roommate?
- Yeah, we live together.

900
01:10:20,402 --> 01:10:24,322
We don't live live together,
we just live together. Shit!

901
01:10:24,447 --> 01:10:28,118
- She's in her bedroom. I'll call her.
- She's in bed, apparently.

902
01:10:28,243 --> 01:10:31,579
- Hi, George.
- Hey, kiddo. Why you in bed? Are you sick?

903
01:10:31,705 --> 01:10:36,501
I'm pregnant, George. Or have you been
so busy with Dr Joley that you forgot?

904
01:10:36,626 --> 01:10:39,879
Nothing's happened with Dr Joley.
I've hardly seen him.

905
01:10:41,256 --> 01:10:44,509
- So then let's go home.
- What do you mean?

906
01:10:44,634 --> 01:10:47,595
There's a bus. At seven o'clock.

907
01:10:47,679 --> 01:10:50,765
- Tonight?
- Sure. Why not?

908
01:10:50,890 --> 01:10:53,268
I don't want you travelling alone so late.

909
01:10:53,393 --> 01:10:56,980
How about I borrow my brother's car
and pick you up tomorrow?

910
01:10:57,105 --> 01:11:01,526
George, please, please.
I'm so miserable. Please...

911
01:11:01,609 --> 01:11:05,447
You could be on a train, too,
and we could be in our beds by midnight.

912
01:11:06,489 --> 01:11:09,159
- Nina...
- Please. You have to rescue me.

913
01:11:09,242 --> 01:11:14,372
I have got to get away from here,
and there's nothing for you to stay there for.

914
01:11:15,332 --> 01:11:18,585
Anybody who bolts from the Hamptons
is OK with me.

915
01:11:18,668 --> 01:11:21,796
I hate it here. It's so pretentious.

916
01:11:24,841 --> 01:11:30,764
If I wasn't married and you weren't my wife's
stepsister, I'd have an affair with you.

917
01:11:30,889 --> 01:11:33,183
I think you're terrific.

918
01:11:33,266 --> 01:11:35,560
- Want some money?
- No, I'm fine.

919
01:11:35,685 --> 01:11:38,605
- How about some Chuckles?
- No.

920
01:11:38,688 --> 01:11:45,028
- I got the new Michael Crichton in the car.
- Oh, no, really. Thanks, Sidney.

921
01:11:45,153 --> 01:11:48,239
OK. Oh, gosh. Photographs. I got it.

922
01:12:02,253 --> 01:12:04,464
Hi.

923
01:12:06,758 --> 01:12:08,426
Hi, man.

924
01:12:11,054 --> 01:12:12,847
Hi, Melissa.

925
01:12:12,931 --> 01:12:14,599
Hi.

926
01:12:30,740 --> 01:12:32,784
- So, how are you, huh?
- Oh, shit!

927
01:12:32,909 --> 01:12:37,163
- Hey, let me help you out.
- No, I'm fine, Vince. I got it. I'm fine.

928
01:12:37,247 --> 01:12:39,124
OK.

929
01:12:40,792 --> 01:12:42,836
Vince, honey?

930
01:12:56,850 --> 01:12:59,144
Melissa, I'm just gonna say goodbye.

931
01:12:59,227 --> 01:13:01,938
- Vince, I'm really tired.
- Just be a minute.

932
01:13:02,022 --> 01:13:04,315
- Can I put you in a taxi?
- No, I'm fine.

933
01:13:04,399 --> 01:13:07,193
- Come on...
- Vince, please! I'm fine, really.

934
01:13:07,277 --> 01:13:11,114
- Give my love to George.
- Oh, sure. I certainly will.

935
01:13:15,827 --> 01:13:17,704
Hey!

936
01:13:28,381 --> 01:13:31,134
Oh. Oh, excuse me? Excuse me?

937
01:13:31,217 --> 01:13:34,346
Oh, you're gonna be so glad you met me.

938
01:13:34,429 --> 01:13:38,767
My purse was just stolen
and I'm pregnant and I have no way home.

939
01:13:38,850 --> 01:13:41,061
- Are you hurt?
- No, I'm fine.

940
01:13:41,144 --> 01:13:44,481
- You sure?
- Yeah. It's just my purse was stolen.

941
01:13:44,564 --> 01:13:47,484
Well, let's go. I got it.

942
01:13:47,567 --> 01:13:49,194
Oh, thank God.

943
01:13:49,319 --> 01:13:55,575
So, we'll go report all this, and then I'm
getting off duty, so I'll give you a lift home.

944
01:13:55,700 --> 01:14:00,246
I'm surprised he didn't arrest me. I'm mugged
and the goddamn desk sergeant blames me.

945
01:14:00,372 --> 01:14:03,541
He's the only one like that.
The rest of us are sensitive.

946
01:14:03,667 --> 01:14:08,797
"Lady, you asked for it. " I thought people
like that were banned from the police force.

947
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:12,384
It's none of his goddamn business
where the fuck my husband is!

948
01:14:12,509 --> 01:14:16,179
- You don't seem to care.
- Me? I used to give women lots of opinions,

949
01:14:16,262 --> 01:14:18,807
but now I go with the flow.

950
01:14:20,266 --> 01:14:22,560
- Are you gay?
- I'm sorry?

951
01:14:22,644 --> 01:14:27,524
I've a theory that a man who doesn't hit you
over the head with his opinions must be gay.

952
01:14:27,607 --> 01:14:32,487
- Well, that makes as much sense as Freud.
- Makes a hell of a lot more sense than Freud!

953
01:14:32,612 --> 01:14:35,782
Freud doesn't know dick about women.

954
01:14:37,450 --> 01:14:39,327
I can't believe I just said that.

955
01:14:40,578 --> 01:14:43,498
- Very nice of you to drive me home.
- Oh, not a problem.

956
01:14:43,581 --> 01:14:47,168
If I were married,
I'd want someone to drive my wife home.

957
01:14:50,755 --> 01:14:53,591
- Will your husband be there?
- I don't have a husband.

958
01:14:53,675 --> 01:14:58,722
- The father?
- Oh, no, no. He will definitely not be there.

959
01:14:58,805 --> 01:15:01,182
I hardly speak to him.

960
01:15:01,307 --> 01:15:07,397
Well, you don't find anyone new
till you're brave enough to give up the old.

961
01:15:07,522 --> 01:15:10,442
I don't really wanna find anyone new.

962
01:15:10,525 --> 01:15:12,485
That's good.

963
01:15:12,610 --> 01:15:14,988
- Happy with the status quo.
- Yeah.

964
01:15:15,113 --> 01:15:16,990
Me, too.

965
01:15:17,115 --> 01:15:20,702
But you're so nice.
You should be married.

966
01:15:22,370 --> 01:15:26,416
You think all nice people are married?
What kind of counsellor are you?

967
01:15:28,877 --> 01:15:33,673
Great. You can stop right over there.
Thank you so much.

968
01:15:39,429 --> 01:15:41,723
You're really kind.

969
01:15:41,806 --> 01:15:43,850
Oh!

970
01:15:46,770 --> 01:15:48,480
George!

971
01:15:48,605 --> 01:15:51,566
Oh, my gosh! You're back already? Hi!

972
01:15:51,650 --> 01:15:53,109
Oh!

973
01:15:53,193 --> 01:15:57,572
- Did you get a ride home?
- No. My purse got stolen at the bus station.

974
01:15:57,697 --> 01:16:00,075
- What?
- And Vince and Melissa were on the bus.

975
01:16:00,158 --> 01:16:06,956
And Sidney told me he would have an affair
with me! It's been the weekend from hell.

976
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:09,751
Come on. I'll make you some tea.

977
01:16:24,474 --> 01:16:29,521
Hiya, sweetie. George, terrific news
about you and Dr Joley. Good for you.

978
01:16:29,604 --> 01:16:31,064
- Thanks.
- Bye, George.

979
01:16:33,149 --> 01:16:34,776
Hey.

980
01:16:34,901 --> 01:16:39,781
- Nina, you find out who the father is yet?
- I call the shots, Kiesha.

981
01:16:39,906 --> 01:16:41,950
Yeah!

982
01:16:43,493 --> 01:16:47,247
- So what's for supper, Nina?
- Pot roast. It's George's favourite.

983
01:16:47,372 --> 01:16:49,249
- Is he back yet?
- I don't know.

984
01:16:49,582 --> 01:16:51,710
Paul?

985
01:16:51,835 --> 01:16:54,462
Oh, jeez. He's supposed to be at the theatre.

986
01:16:55,422 --> 01:16:57,132
Paul?

987
01:16:57,257 --> 01:17:00,176
I fled at half-time.

988
01:17:00,260 --> 01:17:04,180
A lot of pumped-up men
taking their clothes off. Dreadfully boring.

989
01:17:05,098 --> 01:17:09,019
I've got to see King Lear tomorrow night,
God help me.

990
01:17:09,102 --> 01:17:13,398
I fully expect him to step on stage,
say he's old, hot and strip to his underwear.

991
01:17:13,523 --> 01:17:16,067
Oh, would you like a glass of vino?

992
01:17:16,192 --> 01:17:20,655
And tell whoever it is you've got in there
he's left his knapsack on the sofa.

993
01:17:30,290 --> 01:17:34,836
Ah, it's the graduate.
Do, please, come and sit down.

994
01:17:45,805 --> 01:17:50,769
Paul and I are currently meandering through
some of the better Australian Chardonnays.

995
01:17:50,894 --> 01:17:53,772
- Can I tempt you?
- No, thank you.

996
01:17:53,855 --> 01:17:55,106
Oh.

997
01:17:55,190 --> 01:17:57,067
Paul?

998
01:17:58,443 --> 01:18:03,073
So, how's our distinguished
Shavian scholar Dr Joley?

999
01:18:04,407 --> 01:18:08,703
Well, I haven't seen him
since the critics' convention.

1000
01:18:11,331 --> 01:18:14,209
Actually, George lives with a woman.

1001
01:18:15,877 --> 01:18:18,004
Really?

1002
01:18:18,088 --> 01:18:20,382
How Bloomsbury.

1003
01:18:21,549 --> 01:18:26,096
- Nina's my best friend.
- Paul and I visit the theatre quite often.

1004
01:18:26,179 --> 01:18:29,766
Perhaps you and your best friend
would care to join us one evening.

1005
01:18:29,849 --> 01:18:35,146
That's very kind of you,
but I'm not sure she likes the theatre.

1006
01:18:35,230 --> 01:18:40,110
Oh, she's absolutely right.
There's nothing to see.

1007
01:18:41,569 --> 01:18:45,240
Well, perhaps we could
go and have a meal together sometime.

1008
01:18:45,323 --> 01:18:48,910
We'd like to see more of you,
in any event, d'you know?

1009
01:18:50,745 --> 01:18:53,915
Well, I hope so.
You know, I'm sorry... I really...

1010
01:18:53,999 --> 01:18:56,042
Oh. Really?

1011
01:18:58,920 --> 01:19:01,464
Don't forget your little bag.

1012
01:19:02,340 --> 01:19:06,386
- Well, it's nice seeing you.
- Yes, indeed. Good night.

1013
01:19:07,554 --> 01:19:09,597
I'll be right back.

1014
01:19:17,188 --> 01:19:19,232
I'll call you tomorrow.

1015
01:19:33,997 --> 01:19:37,250
Thank you for returning my call.

1016
01:19:38,084 --> 01:19:45,050
Nina, you were probably right. You and I
as a couple were a pretty miserable match.

1017
01:19:45,175 --> 01:19:47,052
But I still love you.

1018
01:19:47,135 --> 01:19:51,181
That's my problem. I can deal with that.

1019
01:19:52,432 --> 01:19:57,645
Nina, whatever way
that you're planning on doing this,

1020
01:19:57,729 --> 01:20:00,482
for once in my life I'm not gonna tell you how.

1021
01:20:02,567 --> 01:20:07,906
I would just like to think
that I could somehow be part of the picture.

1022
01:20:10,825 --> 01:20:12,702
Vince,

1023
01:20:12,827 --> 01:20:15,121
you're the daddy.

1024
01:20:20,418 --> 01:20:22,712
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

1025
01:20:22,837 --> 01:20:25,840
- How are you?
- Louis. This is Vince.

1026
01:20:25,965 --> 01:20:28,259
- Hi. Louis Crowley.
- Vince McBride.

1027
01:20:28,343 --> 01:20:31,054
This is my nephew Joe and my niece Sophie.

1028
01:20:31,137 --> 01:20:34,974
- Vince is the father of my...
- Baby. I'm the father of the baby.

1029
01:20:35,058 --> 01:20:37,519
Oh, I see... And how's...

1030
01:20:37,602 --> 01:20:40,689
- George. My roommate. He's...
- He's fine. He's home.

1031
01:20:40,814 --> 01:20:46,152
- Oh. Hey, great. Go with the flow.
- That's right.

1032
01:20:46,236 --> 01:20:49,155
The workings of her mind
appealed to him.

1033
01:20:49,239 --> 01:20:56,121
She leaves her warm bed in the cold dawn
to rush there full of zeal and loyalty...

1034
01:21:10,135 --> 01:21:15,348
Coming up,
Kurt will have sports. Stay with us.

1035
01:21:25,859 --> 01:21:27,902
Hi. Hey.

1036
01:21:28,028 --> 01:21:30,071
- Sorry.
- Don't be sorry.

1037
01:21:30,196 --> 01:21:33,533
Sorry I'm late.
Yeah, God, I'm sorry.

1038
01:21:33,658 --> 01:21:38,538
Did Nina tell you I was visiting some
college friends? And we drank too much...

1039
01:21:38,621 --> 01:21:41,333
- Well, why didn't you bring them?
- What?

1040
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:48,340
What a shame to break up such a great party.
I'd like to meet your friends someday.

1041
01:21:48,465 --> 01:21:51,009
- So, how late did you stay up?
- Late.

1042
01:21:51,092 --> 01:21:55,472
So late there wasn't a cab left
in Manhattan, huh?

1043
01:21:55,555 --> 01:22:00,769
- Well, we were all too wrecked to go home.
- Whoo! My big brother, the party animal.

1044
01:22:00,852 --> 01:22:02,896
- Coffee?
- Yeah, please.

1045
01:22:02,979 --> 01:22:09,402
- D'you wanna hear the specials?
- No. Just orange juice and eggs Florentine.

1046
01:22:09,527 --> 01:22:16,660
- So, Caroline, is the wedding still on?
- I haven't heard otherwise, but I'm waiting.

1047
01:22:16,743 --> 01:22:19,996
- Well, we're looking forward to it.
- If you can make it.

1048
01:22:20,121 --> 01:22:22,999
He's been busy this fall with faculty meetings.

1049
01:22:23,083 --> 01:22:26,586
Yeah, I'm trying to get things in order
before the baby comes.

1050
01:22:26,711 --> 01:22:30,131
I never thought I'd hear my big brother
talk about babies coming.

1051
01:22:30,215 --> 01:22:36,388
- And before me. That's what pisses me off.
- I think what you guys are doing is fantastic.

1052
01:22:36,471 --> 01:22:40,141
Here's my question though:
What about the father?

1053
01:22:40,266 --> 01:22:44,646
This guy must be the most interesting guy
in the world, or the most tolerant.

1054
01:22:44,729 --> 01:22:48,650
Actually, he's dating
George's colleague Melissa,

1055
01:22:48,775 --> 01:22:51,069
so that takes a shitload of tolerance.

1056
01:22:51,194 --> 01:22:53,947
They're not dating any more. They broke up.

1057
01:22:54,030 --> 01:22:57,534
- Wait, who's this Melissa? Is she cute?
- Frank!

1058
01:22:57,617 --> 01:23:01,788
I'm just trying to keep my options open.

1059
01:23:02,122 --> 01:23:07,419
- Frank, you're horrible.
- Aren't we all just horrible? Aren't men jerks?

1060
01:23:07,502 --> 01:23:10,380
I think Nina and George
have a great relationship.

1061
01:23:10,463 --> 01:23:14,718
Yeah, when we see each other
we have a great relationship.

1062
01:23:19,472 --> 01:23:22,976
George, when they complain
about not seeing you enough,

1063
01:23:23,059 --> 01:23:27,772
you have to buy them a diamond
or take them to the theatre.

1064
01:23:27,856 --> 01:23:31,609
Maybe we could go see a friend of mine
who's in a play next weekend.

1065
01:23:31,693 --> 01:23:36,823
Well, I'm on call next weekend.
Frank certainly isn't going without me.

1066
01:23:36,948 --> 01:23:38,408
- Come on...
- No.

1067
01:23:38,491 --> 01:23:42,329
So does that mean I get a date
alone with you this weekend?

1068
01:23:42,412 --> 01:23:46,458
Or will I get another call Saturday afternoon?

1069
01:23:47,542 --> 01:23:51,296
Saints do not move.
They grant for prayers' sake.

1070
01:23:51,379 --> 01:23:56,092
Then move not
while my prayer's effect I take.

1071
01:23:59,679 --> 01:24:03,767
Thus from my lips, by thine,
my sin is purged.

1072
01:24:03,850 --> 01:24:06,728
Then have my lips
the sin that they have took.

1073
01:24:06,811 --> 01:24:09,105
Sin from my lips?

1074
01:24:09,189 --> 01:24:11,900
O, trespass sweetly urged.

1075
01:24:12,651 --> 01:24:14,694
Give me my sin again.

1076
01:24:21,951 --> 01:24:23,536
You kiss by the book.

1077
01:24:30,794 --> 01:24:33,922
- Here we are. Sorry about that.
- Thanks.

1078
01:24:34,005 --> 01:24:36,299
- Well, cheers.
- Cheers.

1079
01:24:36,424 --> 01:24:40,804
So nice to meet you.
George talks about you all the time. Ah.

1080
01:24:45,266 --> 01:24:47,936
- Oh!
- You were fantastic!

1081
01:24:48,019 --> 01:24:51,940
- Oh, and this is Nina.
- Hi. You were great.

1082
01:24:52,065 --> 01:24:54,693
Great to meet you.
George talks about you all the time.

1083
01:24:54,776 --> 01:24:58,279
Hey, George. George! How are you?

1084
01:24:58,363 --> 01:25:01,700
- I want you to meet somebody.
- I don't know if you remember me.

1085
01:25:01,825 --> 01:25:04,661
- Yeah!
- We talked about Walt Whitman. Trotter Bull.

1086
01:25:04,744 --> 01:25:11,710
- Paul! Paul! Paul! This is Trotter Bull.
- Oh, my God. I've heard so much about you.

1087
01:25:11,793 --> 01:25:14,587
George talks about you all the time.

1088
01:25:15,213 --> 01:25:19,384
Is that right?
Well, you were wonderful in the play.

1089
01:25:19,467 --> 01:25:23,138
- Wasn't he great?
- It was so nice seeing you again.

1090
01:25:23,263 --> 01:25:26,766
Let me give you my card -
if you ever need a stockbroker, OK?

1091
01:25:26,891 --> 01:25:31,688
- Thanks a lot. Great seeing you, Trotter.
- Hey, we've got that ten o'clock thing.

1092
01:25:31,813 --> 01:25:35,400
- Nice to meet you.
- I wish he'd been our Mercutio instead.

1093
01:25:35,525 --> 01:25:39,738
- Rodney, please.
- And he was right. You were awfully good.

1094
01:25:39,821 --> 01:25:42,282
But people do modern-dress Shakespeare

1095
01:25:42,365 --> 01:25:46,411
because they have no instinct
for any other period.

1096
01:25:46,494 --> 01:25:52,417
Clearly, the no-talent who directed this hoped
to transform the world's greatest love story

1097
01:25:52,500 --> 01:25:56,004
into a Calvin Klein commercial.
The man should be shot!

1098
01:25:56,129 --> 01:25:57,839
- Mr Fraser.
- Yes?

1099
01:25:57,922 --> 01:25:59,591
- I'm the director.
- Ah.

1100
01:25:59,674 --> 01:26:00,759
Oh!

1101
01:26:03,970 --> 01:26:07,891
- Come on, let me help you.
- Thank you.

1102
01:26:08,016 --> 01:26:09,267
Good night.

1103
01:26:09,351 --> 01:26:14,064
George and I were wondering what you
and Rodney were doing for Thanksgiving.

1104
01:26:14,189 --> 01:26:18,818
- I'm sorry, we...
- No, we'd love to come. How kind. Thank you.

1105
01:26:18,902 --> 01:26:22,072
Ooh, I'm sorry. Wonderful.

1106
01:26:22,155 --> 01:26:24,199
- OK, so one o'clock.
- We'll be there.

1107
01:26:24,324 --> 01:26:26,201
OK.

1108
01:26:27,160 --> 01:26:29,204
- Bye.
- Good night.

1109
01:26:30,372 --> 01:26:33,124
You're an extraordinary person.

1110
01:26:33,208 --> 01:26:35,919
They seem like a lovely couple.

1111
01:26:39,464 --> 01:26:46,304
Hey, you! I don't care what you say. I love Les
Mis, and Andrew Lloyd Webber's a genius.

1112
01:26:49,766 --> 01:26:52,727
- Hello. Hi.
- Oh, hello. Lovely to see you again.

1113
01:26:52,811 --> 01:26:57,941
- Happy Thanksgiving. We're through here.
- George, happy Thanksgiving.

1114
01:26:58,066 --> 01:27:00,610
- D'you need any help?
- No. Everything's fine.

1115
01:27:00,694 --> 01:27:05,657
What a relief. Cos, contrary to stereotype,
I'm an awful cook.

1116
01:27:05,782 --> 01:27:08,660
No. Well, make yourselves comfortable.

1117
01:27:08,743 --> 01:27:13,540
Or, George, you could
take them for a walk while I get ready.

1118
01:27:13,665 --> 01:27:21,047
Well, why don't you two children go and play
somewhere and I'll keep Nina company. Hey?

1119
01:27:23,174 --> 01:27:24,843
You should tell her.

1120
01:27:24,926 --> 01:27:27,637
You don't wanna hurt Rodney,
I don't wanna hurt Nina.

1121
01:27:27,721 --> 01:27:31,641
I don't wanna exclude Rodney.
That's different.

1122
01:27:32,475 --> 01:27:35,520
Are you trying to tell me something,
because we could stop.

1123
01:27:35,603 --> 01:27:38,857
No. I...

1124
01:27:38,982 --> 01:27:43,236
This isn't easy.
I promised her I'd help her with the baby.

1125
01:27:43,320 --> 01:27:46,740
That's great. Help her.
Be the uncle, be the godfather.

1126
01:27:46,823 --> 01:27:52,120
No, you don't understand. I'm more excited
about this baby than anything ever in my life.

1127
01:27:52,203 --> 01:27:54,873
- More than me?
- Jeez, Paul, don't make it that way.

1128
01:27:54,956 --> 01:27:57,959
I'm not making it that way. You are.

1129
01:28:01,421 --> 01:28:03,798
I love you very much.

1130
01:28:05,383 --> 01:28:09,554
I think we're both behaving rather well
under the circumstances.

1131
01:28:09,637 --> 01:28:15,643
After all, it's not always easy
being alone in the bedroom next door.

1132
01:28:18,104 --> 01:28:20,315
Next door to George and Paul?

1133
01:28:20,398 --> 01:28:22,442
You knew that?

1134
01:28:22,567 --> 01:28:25,445
Well, of course. Of course I knew that.

1135
01:28:25,528 --> 01:28:31,868
- I think Paul's great. I think he's just great.
- Well, we're all great.

1136
01:28:31,951 --> 01:28:36,498
- You must think I'm pretty peculiar.
- I have opinions about Shakespeare.

1137
01:28:36,623 --> 01:28:40,752
About other people's lifestyles
I have absolutely no opinions whatsoever.

1138
01:28:40,835 --> 01:28:44,089
And I don't think
one should be too hard on oneself,

1139
01:28:44,172 --> 01:28:49,135
if the object of one's affection
returns the favour

1140
01:28:49,260 --> 01:28:55,100
with rather less enthusiasm
that one might have hoped.

1141
01:28:55,225 --> 01:29:01,314
But a small observation, if I may, from
someone old enough to be your grandfather.

1142
01:29:01,398 --> 01:29:03,775
You're not that much older.

1143
01:29:05,068 --> 01:29:09,864
Have you noticed that you're the only woman
coming to your Thanksgiving dinner?

1144
01:29:09,990 --> 01:29:12,993
Yes. But all my female friends
are either busy...

1145
01:29:13,076 --> 01:29:18,540
Don't get defensive. Have you also noticed
that you're the only practising heterosexual

1146
01:29:18,623 --> 01:29:21,793
coming to your Thanksgiving dinner?

1147
01:29:23,336 --> 01:29:27,590
Well, I haven't practised in a while.

1148
01:29:27,674 --> 01:29:29,801
I'm serious.

1149
01:29:29,884 --> 01:29:35,724
What happens when all the men
at your Thanksgiving dinner find other men?

1150
01:29:35,807 --> 01:29:38,101
Who's at your table then?

1151
01:29:39,436 --> 01:29:46,359
Don't fix your life so that you're left alone
right when you come into the middle of it.

1152
01:29:52,657 --> 01:29:57,996
Lord, for the erring thought

1153
01:29:58,079 --> 01:30:00,540
Not into evil wrought:

1154
01:30:00,665 --> 01:30:05,879
Lord, for the wicked will
Betrayed and baffled still:

1155
01:30:06,796 --> 01:30:11,176
For the heart from itself kept,

1156
01:30:11,259 --> 01:30:14,763
Our Thanksgiving accept.

1157
01:30:17,015 --> 01:30:20,518
To Nina and George,
our wonderful new friends.

1158
01:30:20,602 --> 01:30:22,479
To Nina and George.

1159
01:30:22,562 --> 01:30:24,022
- To friendship.
- Yes.

1160
01:30:24,105 --> 01:30:26,149
To friendship.

1161
01:30:38,328 --> 01:30:40,789
Well,

1162
01:30:40,872 --> 01:30:45,126
Paul, I think you and I
ought to be getting going.

1163
01:30:45,210 --> 01:30:48,713
Actually, I think I'm gonna
hang out here for a while.

1164
01:30:48,838 --> 01:30:50,715
Ah.

1165
01:30:53,510 --> 01:30:57,555
- Is that OK, Rod?
- When would you be getting...

1166
01:31:16,574 --> 01:31:18,451
Right.

1167
01:31:18,535 --> 01:31:21,871
Well, thank you
for including me in your holiday.

1168
01:31:21,997 --> 01:31:24,874
- Thank you for coming.
- Good night.

1169
01:31:24,958 --> 01:31:26,835
Paul.

1170
01:31:27,919 --> 01:31:29,963
Happy Thanksgiving.

1171
01:31:30,547 --> 01:31:32,674
- George.
- Good night.

1172
01:31:32,757 --> 01:31:37,637
- Uh, could I walk you out to the...
- No, I'm fine. Thanks.

1173
01:31:39,014 --> 01:31:41,725
- Thanks. Bye.
- Good night.

1174
01:31:47,814 --> 01:31:55,280
- Well, let's get cracking on these dishes.
- No, it's all right, I've got it. Thank you.

1175
01:31:58,867 --> 01:32:01,786
- You sure?
- Yes, definitely. Good night.

1176
01:32:12,589 --> 01:32:14,632
Thank you.

1177
01:32:16,801 --> 01:32:19,012
Thank you.

1178
01:32:19,095 --> 01:32:22,015
Absolutely the best holiday.

1179
01:32:24,225 --> 01:32:26,269
I love you.

1180
01:32:34,527 --> 01:32:38,448
- It was a wonderful dinner, Nina.
- Thank you.

1181
01:32:55,924 --> 01:32:59,094
Nina, it's three o'clock in the morning.

1182
01:32:59,219 --> 01:33:01,930
I'm sorry. Did I wake you?

1183
01:33:02,013 --> 01:33:03,973
No.

1184
01:33:04,099 --> 01:33:09,729
- Paul wanted some ice cream.
- So sweet. You have so much in common.

1185
01:33:11,690 --> 01:33:15,610
Paul thinks... you don't like him.

1186
01:33:15,735 --> 01:33:17,362
I don't know him.

1187
01:33:18,947 --> 01:33:23,451
- You seem to like Rodney.
- Well, Rodney is a decent and intelligent man

1188
01:33:23,535 --> 01:33:26,329
who is very hurt and insecure.

1189
01:33:27,330 --> 01:33:30,750
We're all very hurt and insecure.
Who do you know that isn't?

1190
01:33:30,834 --> 01:33:36,673
- Paul. Paul seems to be a totally happy guy.
- You don't like him.

1191
01:33:36,756 --> 01:33:40,343
What the hell difference does it make
if I like Paul or not, George?

1192
01:33:40,468 --> 01:33:45,890
You like Paul and that's what's important.
And that's great. I just finished my work.

1193
01:33:45,974 --> 01:33:49,811
Nina, I slept for months in this apartment
with you and Vince right there.

1194
01:33:49,936 --> 01:33:51,563
- That is different.
- How?

1195
01:33:51,688 --> 01:33:55,900
Because you don't tell a woman you love her,
then two days later bring Romeo home!

1196
01:33:55,984 --> 01:34:00,363
- You invited him!
- And Rodney. I thought they were a couple.

1197
01:34:00,447 --> 01:34:05,243
- You didn't think that.
- Well, you didn't tell me otherwise.

1198
01:34:07,454 --> 01:34:09,664
Nina, look at me.

1199
01:34:09,789 --> 01:34:12,167
- Nina, look... Nina, look at me!
- What?

1200
01:34:12,292 --> 01:34:15,879
- We were gonna make up new rules.
- They have to work for both of us.

1201
01:34:15,962 --> 01:34:22,385
- So you can have a man, but I can't?
- No, you cannot have me, Paul and this baby.

1202
01:34:22,510 --> 01:34:25,513
Why? Because you deserve
to have it all and I don't?

1203
01:34:25,638 --> 01:34:30,852
It's not about having it all. It is about
picking one person and making it work.

1204
01:34:30,935 --> 01:34:36,274
And when you're fucking a man next door, it's
clear you don't wanna make it work with me!

1205
01:34:36,358 --> 01:34:39,944
- That's bullshit!
- Oh, fuck off, George!

1206
01:34:42,197 --> 01:34:44,658
You forgot Paul's ice cream!

1207
01:35:13,645 --> 01:35:17,148
Caroline, let's face it.
My little brother is cute!

1208
01:35:17,273 --> 01:35:21,444
If he can deal with the 20 women outside
with pistols, this union will succeed.

1209
01:35:28,743 --> 01:35:34,165
My friend Nina, the wisest person I know,
said to me yesterday:

1210
01:35:34,249 --> 01:35:39,295
"You have to pick one person
and make it work. "

1211
01:35:41,006 --> 01:35:46,302
Frank, I think you picked
absolutely the right person.

1212
01:35:50,432 --> 01:35:52,892
I'd like to propose a toast.

1213
01:35:55,228 --> 01:35:58,106
To the doctors,
Frank and Caroline Colucci Hanson.

1214
01:35:58,189 --> 01:36:00,650
Hear! Hear!

1215
01:36:09,868 --> 01:36:16,124
- Your husband is adorable.
- I can't imagine mine calling me his friend.

1216
01:38:15,368 --> 01:38:18,079
George, I gotta get outta here.

1217
01:38:23,543 --> 01:38:26,880
- You OK?
- Yeah, I'm OK.

1218
01:38:26,963 --> 01:38:29,007
Are you sure?

1219
01:38:29,549 --> 01:38:32,302
Yeah, I just had to get out of there.

1220
01:38:32,385 --> 01:38:35,597
I know. Weddings can be a little much.

1221
01:38:41,061 --> 01:38:43,521
But it works.

1222
01:38:47,317 --> 01:38:49,778
What do you mean?

1223
01:38:53,990 --> 01:38:57,744
I was watching Frank and Caroline today...

1224
01:38:59,037 --> 01:39:01,414
and I just kept thinking...

1225
01:39:03,667 --> 01:39:05,710
"This is real. "

1226
01:39:08,213 --> 01:39:10,674
"And George and I are not. "

1227
01:39:20,308 --> 01:39:22,352
We're just different.

1228
01:39:23,812 --> 01:39:27,399
But I don't think that I am that different.

1229
01:39:31,111 --> 01:39:33,571
I want you to be with me.

1230
01:39:36,116 --> 01:39:38,326
I want you to marry me.

1231
01:39:40,078 --> 01:39:43,665
I want you to love me
the way that I love you.

1232
01:39:46,710 --> 01:39:50,296
I don't really wanna see who you are at all.

1233
01:39:59,806 --> 01:40:01,933
I think you see me.

1234
01:40:03,351 --> 01:40:06,146
Well, then tell me the truth.

1235
01:40:06,229 --> 01:40:08,273
What do you want?

1236
01:40:14,696 --> 01:40:16,740
I want Paul.

1237
01:40:25,040 --> 01:40:30,670
And I wanna be able to look at you
and not feel so hurt by you.

1238
01:40:34,674 --> 01:40:37,218
I'm so sorry.

1239
01:40:37,344 --> 01:40:40,597
The last person in the world
I'd wanna hurt is you.

1240
01:40:40,680 --> 01:40:43,600
I know that. I know.

1241
01:40:43,683 --> 01:40:46,394
You can't choose who you love.

1242
01:40:49,022 --> 01:40:55,028
Paul was the best thing that ever happened
to us. At least he got us to tell the truth.

1243
01:40:55,153 --> 01:40:57,906
But I don't wanna lose you.

1244
01:40:59,949 --> 01:41:02,744
I can't let things stay the same.

1245
01:41:11,836 --> 01:41:16,466
- Take care, man.
- Congratulations, buddy. Way to go!

1246
01:41:22,347 --> 01:41:24,891
Hey. Sorry. I got here as fast as I could.

1247
01:41:25,016 --> 01:41:28,103
No, it's OK.
George was with me the whole time.

1248
01:41:28,186 --> 01:41:30,480
Good.

1249
01:41:30,605 --> 01:41:32,816
- This is Molly.
- There she is.

1250
01:41:32,941 --> 01:41:36,987
Hello, Molly. I'm your dad.

1251
01:41:37,529 --> 01:41:39,197
Yeah.

1252
01:41:39,280 --> 01:41:43,785
Sh-sh-sh.
Molly, Molly, hush, hush. It's OK.

1253
01:41:43,868 --> 01:41:46,955
It's OK. It's OK. I got her.

1254
01:41:56,548 --> 01:41:59,092
Which one of you is the father?

1255
01:41:59,759 --> 01:42:04,014
- Vince McBride is the father.
- Come with me. We have some paperwork.

1256
01:42:04,097 --> 01:42:09,936
Yeah, yeah, sure. Hey, you be nice
to your mother, honey. Here we go.

1257
01:42:12,605 --> 01:42:15,650
Hi. Thank you.

1258
01:42:19,904 --> 01:42:23,742
I wonder if Madame Reynolds
has ballroom dancing for babies.

1259
01:42:23,867 --> 01:42:25,493
Are you kidding?

1260
01:42:25,618 --> 01:42:30,248
Come here, Molly.
Let's show Mommy your dancing legs.

1261
01:42:49,684 --> 01:42:52,771
George, when were you
planning on moving out?

1262
01:42:54,439 --> 01:42:56,316
I don't know.

1263
01:42:57,984 --> 01:43:00,987
I think you should go before I get home.

1264
01:43:04,949 --> 01:43:08,286
Are you sure?
I can stay until you and Molly get settled.

1265
01:43:08,411 --> 01:43:11,247
No, I don't want you there.

1266
01:43:11,331 --> 01:43:13,541
We'll be fine.

1267
01:43:13,625 --> 01:43:18,421
It's time for Molly and me
to get on with our lives.

1268
01:43:22,509 --> 01:43:24,803
I'll speak to Paul.

1269
01:43:25,720 --> 01:43:27,597
Thank you.

1270
01:43:31,559 --> 01:43:35,689
You're a very lucky girl,
Molly McBride Borowski.

1271
01:43:37,315 --> 01:43:40,110
You have the world's best mommy.

1272
01:43:46,825 --> 01:43:48,952
Bye, Nina.

1273
01:43:49,077 --> 01:43:51,121
Bye, George.

1274
01:44:00,046 --> 01:44:02,090
Head up, young person.

1275
01:44:13,935 --> 01:44:15,812
Hi.

1276
01:44:15,937 --> 01:44:17,981
Hi, Molly.

1277
01:44:28,199 --> 01:44:32,620
Hello. I'm George Hanson, principal of
the Prospect Park Cooperative School.

1278
01:44:32,704 --> 01:44:36,291
We wanna welcome you
to our annual music celebration.

1279
01:44:36,374 --> 01:44:40,128
And now on with the show.

1280
01:45:04,903 --> 01:45:06,863
Molly!

1281
01:45:27,801 --> 01:45:30,929
Come on, Molly! Go, Molly!

1282
01:45:43,400 --> 01:45:46,277
Whoo! Molly, yeah!

1283
01:45:46,361 --> 01:45:48,405
Yeah! Yeah!

1284
01:45:53,159 --> 01:45:55,704
- I have an audition.
- When will you be home?

1285
01:45:55,829 --> 01:45:57,288
Right after yoga.

1286
01:45:57,372 --> 01:46:00,250
Are you sure?
You had me over last Saturday.

1287
01:46:00,333 --> 01:46:03,211
- Hey, Rodney, you're family, man.
- Yeah.

1288
01:46:03,294 --> 01:46:07,716
- Constance, why can't I get a nose ring?
- Sally, get in. This is a bad neighbourhood.

1289
01:46:07,799 --> 01:46:12,053
- It's a fucking great neighbourhood.
- And my name is not Constance. It's Mother.

1290
01:46:12,137 --> 01:46:15,807
Nina, don't forget dinner Thursday
with Umberto Eco and Sharon Stone.

1291
01:46:15,890 --> 01:46:19,394
- Oh, goody.
- A bidding war's going for Sharon's memoirs.

1292
01:46:19,519 --> 01:46:24,149
Goodbye, Louis. Good to see you again.
Nina, two seconds.

1293
01:46:24,232 --> 01:46:28,153
- There's someone I want you to meet, so...
- Why? I am with Louis.

1294
01:46:28,236 --> 01:46:33,116
Sweetie, you've made your point. It's time
to move on. Get your hair cut. Sidney?

1295
01:46:33,241 --> 01:46:35,368
- Let's go.
- Yeah, yeah, great.

1296
01:46:35,493 --> 01:46:39,581
Molly, you were great. Perfect.
Coming, coming.

1297
01:46:39,664 --> 01:46:41,958
You were terrific. I love that hat.

1298
01:46:42,042 --> 01:46:45,378
- Can I give you a ride?
- No, I won't use taxpayer dollars

1299
01:46:45,462 --> 01:46:50,425
to fund my personal transportation, Louis.
I'll take the subway, thank you.

1300
01:46:50,508 --> 01:46:52,719
Suit yourself, Vince.

1301
01:46:52,802 --> 01:46:55,347
I'll see you at home.
Bye, Molly. Greatjob.

1302
01:46:55,430 --> 01:46:57,807
- Bye, Louis.
- Bye, Louis.

1303
01:46:57,891 --> 01:47:02,854
Nina, I am the only man in your life who
ever made any sense. You know that, right?

1304
01:47:02,979 --> 01:47:05,357
- I do know that.
- Good.

1305
01:47:05,440 --> 01:47:07,484
- Bye, sweetheart.
- Bye, Daddy.

1306
01:47:07,609 --> 01:47:09,277
I love you.

1307
01:47:09,361 --> 01:47:11,154
George!

1308
01:47:11,696 --> 01:47:15,033
Great show. Love your work.

1309
01:47:15,116 --> 01:47:18,453
Oh, do you guys wanna come over
for dinner Saturday night?

1310
01:47:18,536 --> 01:47:20,830
Sounds great. I'll ask Paul.

1311
01:47:20,914 --> 01:47:24,918
Uncle George, I had more people
come see me than anyone.

1312
01:47:25,001 --> 01:47:28,505
I had Mommy and Daddy and Louis
and Uncle Rodney and Uncle Sidney...

1313
01:47:28,630 --> 01:47:31,174
Honey, you are the luckiest little girl.

1314
01:47:31,257 --> 01:47:34,844
Yeah, and if you ever need any advice,
ask Auntie Constance.

1315
01:47:34,928 --> 01:47:36,972
Oh, stop it!

1316
01:47:44,938 --> 01:47:46,189
OK.

1317
01:47:46,314 --> 01:47:51,444
- You wanna grab some coffee?
- You always go for coffee. All you do is talk.

1318
01:47:51,569 --> 01:47:53,947
Well, excuse me, but we like talking.

1319
01:47:54,072 --> 01:47:58,702
Yeah. Nina, did you everjust wanna
touch her nose? It's just like a little tulip.

1320
01:47:58,827 --> 01:48:02,747
You dare start with her.
It looks nothing like a tulip. Come on.

1321
01:48:02,872 --> 01:48:09,671
- Mommy, I can quote the show.
- You can? Really?

1322
01:48:09,754 --> 01:48:16,469
Yes. Welcome to the...
Prospect Park...
