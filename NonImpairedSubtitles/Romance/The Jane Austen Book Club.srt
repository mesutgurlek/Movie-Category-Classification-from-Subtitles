1
00:01:20,447 --> 00:01:23,143
I told you I don't have time to wait.
What is this?

2
00:01:23,216 --> 00:01:26,413
Do you have any idea? What's going on?

3
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:35,127
I know, honey, I'm on my way, okay?

4
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:40,895
Hi. I need to check your bag.

5
00:02:16,736 --> 00:02:18,670
Right this way.

6
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:26,440
Come on, let's go. Get out of the way, now.

7
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:30,847
Hold it!

8
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:35,111
<i>Please take the ticket.</i>

9
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:38,584
<i>Please take the ticket.</i>

10
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:41,827
<i>Please take the ticket.</i>

11
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:57,068
Come on! Get in there!

12
00:03:07,153 --> 00:03:08,882
<i>Please insert card.</i>

13
00:03:11,157 --> 00:03:12,852
<i>Please insert card.</i>

14
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:17,192
<i>Please insert card.</i>

15
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:21,367
<i>Please insert card.</i>

16
00:03:22,168 --> 00:03:25,535
I can't follow you guys. You drive too slow.

17
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,434
Bernie. Hey.

18
00:03:29,842 --> 00:03:32,242
- Sad, huh?
- Tragic.

19
00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:34,473
- Poor Jocelyn.
- It's ridiculous.

20
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:36,242
- Daniel, he was her world.
- Hold up. Cat hair.

21
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:40,150
Oh, that's why I never wear black.
Don't even look in the mirror anymore.

22
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,882
Should've thought of it years ago.

23
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:46,153
We celebrate a very special life

24
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:51,721
as we lay to rest Jocelyn's cherished
companion, Pridey Sahara Morgan.

25
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:13,474
Honey, we have to stay.
She raised him from a puppy.

26
00:04:13,553 --> 00:04:15,953
All I know is that if I'm not back
in the office this afternoon,

27
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:17,751
Monday is gonna be hell.

28
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:19,917
She went to every one
of Allegra's birthday parties.

29
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:24,259
Oh, come on. Allegra is our actual child.
Let's get some perspective here.

30
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,264
Do you think if Jocelyn
were married with kids

31
00:04:26,332 --> 00:04:29,460
she'd be giving her dog a state funeral?

32
00:04:29,535 --> 00:04:31,469
This whole thing is warped.

33
00:04:31,537 --> 00:04:34,097
- I find that personally offensive, Dad.
- What?

34
00:04:34,173 --> 00:04:36,698
I mean, I may never be married
or be a mother.

35
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:39,006
Yes, some gay women
get some version of that,

36
00:04:39,078 --> 00:04:41,308
but we don't all need the same things.

37
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:43,406
Can we at least agree that

38
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,677
human beings need

39
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:48,280
human connection?

40
00:04:48,354 --> 00:04:51,585
You know, companionship,
conversation, sex.

41
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:55,560
You get those things from Mom.
Jocelyn gets them from her dogs.

42
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:01,962
Can I take your car?

43
00:05:08,174 --> 00:05:09,698
Dad had to go.

44
00:05:12,211 --> 00:05:14,202
We can't let Jocelyn sit home and brood.

45
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:18,546
Maybe we could all take a class.
Learn Portuguese. Go to Brazil.

46
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:21,678
I don't think I could fit
one more thing in my week, honestly.

47
00:05:21,754 --> 00:05:25,815
No, no, you're right. You're right.
We should make an effort.

48
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:28,383
She just lives so far away from everything.

49
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:36,001
Give it back, Trey.

50
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:38,697
Come on. Give it back.

51
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:45,037
See ya.

52
00:05:53,886 --> 00:05:55,285
Thanks. Take care.

53
00:05:59,058 --> 00:06:00,082
Hi.

54
00:06:00,893 --> 00:06:02,554
- Trey. Yeah.
- Trey.

55
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:04,996
<i>Lovers' Guide to Paris.</i>

56
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:08,557
<i>Food Lovers' Guide.</i>

57
00:06:08,634 --> 00:06:11,865
We're gonna go to Paris. My husband and I.

58
00:06:12,438 --> 00:06:16,431
It's his first time in Paris. Mine, too.

59
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:18,443
- It's a business trip for him.
- Really?

60
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:20,479
They fly him business class.

61
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:25,415
So we're just gonna do an exchange
so that I can tag along.

62
00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:27,282
- That's pretty thrifty.
- Yeah.

63
00:06:27,353 --> 00:06:30,379
I've never been to France. I mean...

64
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:34,716
I've been to Québec. But that's...

65
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:38,162
- It's not in... It's in... Okay.
- No.

66
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:41,496
Do you want me to help you
carry these to your car?

67
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:45,397
- No.
- Okay.

68
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:46,802
- Well, have fun.
- Okay.

69
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:48,636
Send me a postcard.

70
00:06:52,011 --> 00:06:53,478
- Hi.
- Hey.

71
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:56,811
Honey, I'm sorry I'm late.
I stopped to buy us a present.

72
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:59,044
Oh, yeah. What do you got?

73
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:03,884
- What?
- Oh, baby. I'm sorry.

74
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:05,856
I thought I said something.

75
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,415
- Yo, jeez, these guys are terrible.
- What?

76
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:10,223
Been like this all game. This one guy...

77
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,120
Paris is off.

78
00:07:13,065 --> 00:07:15,932
- We're not going to Paris?
- Dale's going.

79
00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:21,030
My boss-boss asked me to take the CEO
of Consolidated to the NBA playoffs.

80
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:24,008
I guess the guys at Consolidated
are like basketball freaks.

81
00:07:24,076 --> 00:07:26,544
But if it's San Antonio, it'll be over in four.

82
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:30,173
Unless Tim Duncan gets hit
with an asteroid or something.

83
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:36,247
Anyway, figure I'll be on the road
for like a week, maybe eight days.

84
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:38,654
Maybe 10, just depending on...

85
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:44,595
Oh, what if your mom came and stayed?

86
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:48,023
Ten days with my mother?

87
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:50,630
Prudie.

88
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:55,641
What, did you want me
to say no to my boss?

89
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:04,343
Always doing something wrong, you know?

90
00:08:06,752 --> 00:08:10,711
I have no idea what I did.
I genuinely have no idea.

91
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,798
I was just thinking about
something Allegra said

92
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,701
at Jocelyn's the other day.

93
00:08:25,771 --> 00:08:27,966
I don't know if it was just
the sadness of the occasion, or...

94
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,405
- Oh, don't make fun, Daniel.
- No, I'm not, I'm not.

95
00:08:29,475 --> 00:08:30,965
- That was her dog.
- No.

96
00:08:31,043 --> 00:08:33,705
I'm saying it affected me.

97
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:36,339
- Come on.
- Okay, honey. Whatever you say.

98
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:38,440
Anyway, so Allegra and I are talking about

99
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,543
how we all need to have

100
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,152
connection, you know?

101
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:47,125
Conversation. Sex.

102
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:50,061
Companionship.

103
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:55,033
And Allegra says,
"Well, you get all that from Mommy."

104
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:57,735
I gotta tell you, it really made me sad.

105
00:08:57,803 --> 00:09:00,101
Oh, baby, she'll find somebody.

106
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:02,640
No, it made me sad for us.

107
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:05,040
See, 'cause I've been struggling

108
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:10,080
with whether a marriage
can sustain all of that

109
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,046
over 20-plus years,

110
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:19,057
or whether it's just inevitable
that after a certain amount of time...

111
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:20,149
What are you...

112
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:22,854
Maybe being with someone else can have

113
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:27,557
a renewing effect, because for me...

114
00:09:32,471 --> 00:09:34,871
I've been seeing a woman at work.

115
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:39,543
We've been together six months now.

116
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:41,637
We can't think of this as a failure.

117
00:09:41,714 --> 00:09:44,148
We have had a very successful marriage.

118
00:09:44,216 --> 00:09:47,879
We've had a long marriage, by any standard.
We've got three wonderful kids.

119
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:49,182
They're grown, they're working, they're...

120
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:52,747
Just open the car door, Daniel,
I need a tissue.

121
00:10:02,468 --> 00:10:04,993
The kids, that's... That's all you.
You know, you...

122
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:09,799
You made all the sacrifices with that.
I know.

123
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:12,673
But there's a logic to us
quitting while we're ahead.

124
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:15,737
And I think that they'll be able to see that.

125
00:10:16,882 --> 00:10:19,817
I don't understand a single word
of what you're saying, Daniel.

126
00:10:19,885 --> 00:10:21,375
Who is this woman?

127
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:26,121
Look, I'm tired of lying to you.

128
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:29,423
I'm tired of making promises to Pam
that I can't keep.

129
00:10:29,495 --> 00:10:31,986
She deserves better. And so do you.

130
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:36,559
And I won't give her up.
That's non-negotiable.

131
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:49,206
Syl.

132
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:57,720
I really like Edmund in this movie.
Have you seen it?

133
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,018
I love this movie.

134
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:02,754
Oh, I like it, but it's not <i>Mansfield Park.</i>

135
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:04,557
It's more of an interpretation.

136
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,495
- Do you know the book?
- Yes.

137
00:11:06,565 --> 00:11:09,329
And I happen to teach film.

138
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:11,597
- Do you like this movie?
- No.

139
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:14,834
Do you know it mixes up Fanny Price
with the author of the book?

140
00:11:14,907 --> 00:11:17,842
Makes Sir Bertram
some kind of slave owner.

141
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,434
Well, it means well.

142
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,139
And a little Jane Austen's
better than none at all.

143
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:24,649
No. No. No.
That is how I talk myself into everything.

144
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:26,985
I'm married to a man

145
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:31,422
who would cancel our trip to Paris
for a basketball game,

146
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:35,221
which is making me a fraud
in front of my students.

147
00:11:35,294 --> 00:11:38,263
A French teacher
who's never been to France?

148
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:39,991
The screenplay is outstanding.

149
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:44,025
Excuse me. I'd like to talk to you.
Come with me.

150
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:45,900
You seem to know a lot about Jane Austen.

151
00:11:45,971 --> 00:11:47,029
I do.

152
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:50,098
You know, Prudie,
I've been married six times.

153
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:53,879
You're always happy at first.
It's how you feel at the end that counts.

154
00:11:53,946 --> 00:11:58,349
I've been thinking, I'd like to get married
again, maybe just once more.

155
00:11:58,984 --> 00:12:03,080
My favorite was Ben Weinberg.
And this is Ben.

156
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:07,681
He produced Fred Astaire movies.
Don't underestimate older men.

157
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,228
We lived in a house in Beverly Hills
that had a little pond

158
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:12,127
and a bridge and goldfish.

159
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:14,132
That's how I met my friend Jocelyn.

160
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,634
- Carlos.
- My pleasure.

161
00:12:16,702 --> 00:12:19,000
Ben was her godfather. Her family's loaded.

162
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,834
Who's Jocelyn again?

163
00:12:21,307 --> 00:12:24,401
The one I wanna start the book club for.
Lost her dog?

164
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:27,640
Eat. So, book club.

165
00:12:27,713 --> 00:12:30,443
I can get Jocelyn and maybe Sylvia.

166
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:32,347
Jocelyn put Sylvia and Daniel together
in high school.

167
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:33,510
They've been together ever since.

168
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:36,953
Though Sylvia's gonna want Daniel
in the book club,

169
00:12:37,022 --> 00:12:38,683
but I think it should be all women.
Don't you?

170
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:41,249
I mean, men, they pontificate
and no one can get a word in edgewise.

171
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:43,056
- Well, I think if you...
- And women won't butt in,

172
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:45,859
but men, they keep monologuing.
Yammer, yammer, yammer.

173
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:48,399
And we keep listening,
protecting their feelings.

174
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:50,560
- But if...
- And men don't do book clubs.

175
00:12:50,636 --> 00:12:53,434
Women want to share,
but men, they hoard what they read,

176
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:55,599
if they crack open a book.

177
00:12:55,674 --> 00:12:57,574
Does your husband read?

178
00:12:57,643 --> 00:12:59,873
He reads stuff online.

179
00:13:02,681 --> 00:13:05,081
You know, it's gonna be
like extracting teeth to get Sylvia,

180
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:07,779
because she has to read so much already.

181
00:13:07,853 --> 00:13:10,378
She works at the state library. But, oh!
Hey, no. Okay.

182
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,151
Now, this is brilliant.

183
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:14,692
We'll only do books we've already read.
Is that inspired?

184
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,955
How do we know what books
all of us have read?

185
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:18,189
Isn't it obvious?

186
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:23,964
<i>Mansfield Park, Pride and Prejudice,</i>
<i>Emma, Northanger Abbey, Persuasion.</i>

187
00:13:24,036 --> 00:13:25,196
- I'm leaving some...
<i>- Sense and Sensibility.</i>

188
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:26,431
And <i>Sense and Sensibility.</i>
It's been three years

189
00:13:26,505 --> 00:13:29,372
since I've read <i>Sense and Sensibility.</i>
I have to pee.

190
00:13:29,441 --> 00:13:30,931
When I get back, hot water and lemon.

191
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,409
And we still have to think
of two more people.

192
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:33,467
Six novels, six people.

193
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:35,980
We'll each be responsible for one book.

194
00:13:36,048 --> 00:13:38,414
All Jane Austen, all the time!

195
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:39,644
It's the perfect antidote.

196
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:41,413
- To what?
- To life.

197
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:45,047
I get <i>Pride and Prejudice.</i>

198
00:13:48,894 --> 00:13:51,727
I called the library
and said you had bronchitis.

199
00:13:51,797 --> 00:13:55,062
Anne Marie's moving your indigenous
peoples meeting to next week.

200
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:56,658
I should go in.

201
00:13:56,869 --> 00:14:02,239
Pam Gower did her law degree at Bolt,
passed the bar in 2002.

202
00:14:02,374 --> 00:14:03,466
She's an infant.

203
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:08,309
She joined the firm
of Perry, Liebman, Avila in 2006.

204
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:10,780
Says here she was divorced in 2005.

205
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,511
Bitch. She went right for Daniel.

206
00:14:12,585 --> 00:14:13,882
She's 45.

207
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:16,814
She's not even young.

208
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:20,689
- Do you think he has a brain tumor?
- I think he fell in love.

209
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:22,522
Well, I'm rooting for the brain tumor.

210
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:25,223
People our age don't fall in love.
I mean, I've never even been in love.

211
00:14:25,297 --> 00:14:28,789
- You've never been in love?
- I've had sexual partners.

212
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:32,269
I mean, I don't know.
I wouldn't mind falling in love,

213
00:14:32,338 --> 00:14:34,829
but it just all seems
like fiction to me, anyway.

214
00:14:34,907 --> 00:14:38,741
Well, for a fiction,
he just threw 20 years of marriage away

215
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:40,301
on an impulse.

216
00:14:40,746 --> 00:14:43,044
Do you think he was thinking,
the whole time,

217
00:14:43,115 --> 00:14:44,377
"I can't wait to get out of here?"

218
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:47,112
- Am I really that uninteresting?
- No.

219
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:50,986
- I can't believe I'm alone at this age.
- Mom, you're not alone.

220
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:53,183
And listen to me.
Alone's not the end of the world.

221
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:56,820
For as many years as you've been married
I've been quite happily unmarried.

222
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,761
It's just so unfair.

223
00:14:58,831 --> 00:15:00,890
He can start his life over again.
And at this age.

224
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:04,561
You know, men can do that.
Women... It's over.

225
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:06,070
You're beautiful, Mommy.

226
00:15:06,138 --> 00:15:08,504
Yes, and accomplished and interesting.

227
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,474
You're not without your options, Sylvia.

228
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:13,705
Daniel's the one with options.
He can sleep with anyone.

229
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:17,271
Twenty-year-olds.
People will say, "Way to go, Daniel."

230
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:20,950
If I tried to sleep with someone
that age, it'd be pathetic.

231
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:24,285
Well, yeah, that's 'cause
guys my age are lame.

232
00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:27,086
- My body will become a museum.
- No, it won't.

233
00:15:27,192 --> 00:15:31,322
We'll get you a membership to my gym.
You might even meet somebody.

234
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:37,996
I don't wanna meet someone.

235
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:41,801
I wanna pull the covers over my head
and read novels.

236
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:44,304
And eat.

237
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:47,635
I'm starving.

238
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:51,576
Allegra, <i>mija,</i> go get me a dozen eggs.

239
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:55,083
- I'm gonna make a flan.
- Okay.

240
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,286
Can you stay with her this weekend?

241
00:15:58,357 --> 00:16:00,985
- Actually, I'm moving back in.
- Really?

242
00:16:01,493 --> 00:16:06,260
My lease is almost up and, you know,
I won't let her be here alone.

243
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:09,163
Oh, sweetie, that's... Thank you.
You're amazing.

244
00:16:09,234 --> 00:16:12,032
See, that's why people have children.

245
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:16,803
My father left my mom when I was 10.
Sylvia was the first person I told.

246
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:18,968
That's when I knew
we were really best friends.

247
00:16:19,044 --> 00:16:21,035
I'm gonna be at Stockton
at the Breeders' Convention,

248
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:22,171
if you need me, okay?

249
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:44,327
- Are you here for the Buffy conference?
- Oh, no.

250
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,176
Excuse me.

251
00:16:58,283 --> 00:17:00,717
My dog has the same exact collar.

252
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:16,631
- She was invisible.
- What?

253
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,431
It's a game. They're vampires.

254
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:20,563
When you see one of them
with their arms crossed like that,

255
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,731
you should pretend you don't see her.

256
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:24,298
That's why she didn't answer you.
Nothing personal.

257
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:25,604
Thanks.

258
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:30,343
- My name's Grigg.
- Greg?

259
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:32,281
Grigg, G-R-l-G-G.

260
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:37,352
Oh. I'm meeting some people, Grigg.

261
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:41,518
Okay.

262
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:01,144
Can I have a whiskey straight up?

263
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:34,040
Excuse me. Could I apologize? I'm Jocelyn.

264
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,013
Your friend isn't coming?

265
00:18:36,081 --> 00:18:38,413
I'm meeting him a little later.

266
00:18:39,685 --> 00:18:43,451
So how do you know so much
about the "faux vampire" scene?

267
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:46,889
That's funny. Well, it's...

268
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,484
I'm here for a sci-fi conference.

269
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:54,863
So the Buffy contingent is a kind of,
you know, offshoot of that.

270
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:57,094
Yeah. You read much science fiction?

271
00:18:57,169 --> 00:19:00,502
I'm more of a Jane Austen,
<i>Jane Eyre</i> kind of girl.

272
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:02,631
Oh, right, yeah. No, I never really...

273
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:05,404
Read those books? Yeah. Yeah.

274
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:09,308
So, where do you live?

275
00:19:09,381 --> 00:19:13,784
I just relocated to the Sacramento area.
I do tech support at U.

276
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:18,114
You know who you might like?
Ursula Le Guin.

277
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:20,988
<i>Left Hand of Darkness. Lathe of Heaven.</i>

278
00:19:21,093 --> 00:19:24,585
She's science fiction
but she's just a terrific writer.

279
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:26,062
- Have to check her out.
- Yeah.

280
00:19:26,131 --> 00:19:30,067
My sisters love those books.
I really think you might like them.

281
00:19:33,705 --> 00:19:36,230
And I'm willing to be directed as well.

282
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:38,503
Seriously, you know,
if you tell me who I should be reading,

283
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:40,841
I promise to read it.

284
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:43,108
I'll give you my email.

285
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:46,548
That's the old one.
I'll write those books, too.

286
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:49,985
You know what I'm actually
wondering before I go?

287
00:19:50,055 --> 00:19:52,489
How do you feel about older women?

288
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:56,693
Great. Yeah.

289
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:00,990
I have three older sisters, so...

290
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:04,367
You know, I like all women.

291
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:06,961
Good. That's great.

292
00:20:08,006 --> 00:20:10,804
- Well, thanks. I'll be in touch.
- Oh, okay.

293
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:11,865
Great.

294
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:13,605
- Yeah, bye.
- Bye.

295
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:19,514
Oh, good, Prudie, you're here.

296
00:20:19,585 --> 00:20:21,917
Save these tables, okay?
Oh, Jocelyn, Prudie.

297
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:23,511
- Hi, how are you?
- Hello. Good.

298
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:26,752
- So what do you want, Prudie?
- A soy cappuccino.

299
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:31,095
I have to be allowed
to miss one meeting out of the six.

300
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:32,494
I can only do this if there's no pressure.

301
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:35,124
- Hey. Mom's looking for parking.
- Hi.

302
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,100
That's Prudie. Say hi.

303
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:41,429
We're still only five. Too bad about Daniel.

304
00:20:41,506 --> 00:20:45,966
He could've filled in, although clearly
he's never read Jane Austen.

305
00:20:46,044 --> 00:20:49,036
For Prudie's sake,
the last thing we need is an Austen virgin.

306
00:20:49,114 --> 00:20:50,877
We need real discussion.

307
00:20:50,949 --> 00:20:54,578
I sort of invited someone.
Said he might come, maybe.

308
00:20:54,686 --> 00:20:56,745
- He?
- No one I'm interested in.

309
00:20:57,556 --> 00:21:00,923
He's young, compliant,
said he might enjoy being in a book club.

310
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:02,984
I'm sure Daniel's read Jane Austen.

311
00:21:03,061 --> 00:21:04,995
No man who reads Austen
would ever dump his wife

312
00:21:05,063 --> 00:21:07,293
because it's better for the other woman.

313
00:21:07,366 --> 00:21:08,731
Chai latte with a shot.

314
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,530
I'm so sorry. I'm really behind.

315
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:14,003
I got slammed with orders on my website.

316
00:21:14,072 --> 00:21:17,906
I've actually... I've started adding
these little dangles at the top here.

317
00:21:17,976 --> 00:21:21,036
- What do you think?
- I'm no judge.

318
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,603
I mean, my idea of jewelry

319
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:26,048
is Coco Chanel's Byzantine oeuvre
from the 1920s.

320
00:21:26,718 --> 00:21:29,551
Oh! Definitely. Yeah, I get that.

321
00:21:31,556 --> 00:21:34,548
Being the only child of a woman
who gave birth in a commune

322
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:39,586
after changing her name to Sky Girl,
I've come to loathe hippie handicrafts.

323
00:21:42,501 --> 00:21:43,968
There she is.

324
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:48,397
Actually, I'm not so sure
I wanna do this book club.

325
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:53,205
So, quick, while Sylvia's still in line,
how she's doing without Daniel?

326
00:21:53,278 --> 00:21:55,678
She's still stuck in the wounded stage.

327
00:21:55,747 --> 00:21:59,410
- When she's ready for anger, I am so there.
- Me, too.

328
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:00,576
My dad left my mom.

329
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:03,553
Prudie is no stranger
to marital disappointment.

330
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:05,452
Actually, we're fine now.

331
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:07,958
You're married? But no ring, huh?

332
00:22:08,927 --> 00:22:11,054
Yeah, it's this hand, and... I teach French.

333
00:22:11,129 --> 00:22:13,597
You teach French, so you wear your
wedding ring on the right hand?

334
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:16,429
- It's a European custom.
- Are you European?

335
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:19,937
So Prudie, you haven't said which book
you wanna be responsible for.

336
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:21,563
Maybe <i>Persuasion.</i>

337
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:24,905
'Cause I'm increasingly drawn
to its elegiac tone.

338
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:27,945
- Don't think I'm doing the book club.
- You're doing it.

339
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:30,641
You lead one discussion. Pick a book.

340
00:22:31,483 --> 00:22:35,249
Well, I just saw <i>Sense and Sensibility,</i>

341
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:38,949
and I think,
since I'm back living with my mom,

342
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:42,460
I really get that whole two-women,

343
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:46,088
tight-relationship, living-together-
but-really-opposites thing.

344
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:48,029
Is it weird living back at home again?

345
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:51,797
I think what Austen is actually writing about
is two sisters,

346
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:55,237
moving separately toward what
they each believe to be a perfect love.

347
00:22:55,307 --> 00:22:59,175
Okay, but the point is
Marianne and Elinor's relationship...

348
00:22:59,244 --> 00:23:01,735
Maybe if you'd read the book
instead of watching the movie...

349
00:23:01,813 --> 00:23:04,611
- I thought I might do <i>Emma.</i>
- Which leaves what for Sylvia?

350
00:23:04,683 --> 00:23:06,651
<i>Northanger Abbey</i> and <i>Mansfield Park.</i>

351
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,909
Which one's gonna make her feel better?

352
00:23:09,988 --> 00:23:12,081
Because we're only doing the book club
to get her mind off Daniel.

353
00:23:12,157 --> 00:23:14,421
I thought the reason for the book club
was for my not going to Paris.

354
00:23:14,493 --> 00:23:16,085
- Exactly.
<i>- Northanger Abbey.</i>

355
00:23:16,161 --> 00:23:17,753
No, don't make her do <i>Northanger.</i>

356
00:23:17,829 --> 00:23:20,229
I mean, first you're going off
to all these dances,

357
00:23:20,298 --> 00:23:24,564
and then suddenly it's sort of like
<i>Nightmare on Northanger Abbey Street.</i>

358
00:23:24,636 --> 00:23:27,230
I'm afraid this isn't the book club
that I had in mind.

359
00:23:27,305 --> 00:23:30,672
I mean, I find when someone in the group
feels superior to the author,

360
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:32,437
it just... It sets the wrong tone.

361
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:33,671
Okay, I'm happy to leave.

362
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:37,181
- No, Allegra. No. Allegra. No.
- Allegra, you can't. You can't.

363
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:39,740
After this day, I am so happy
to be talking about Jane Austen.

364
00:23:39,818 --> 00:23:41,513
- Hi.
- Hi. Did we choose the books yet?

365
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:43,781
Sylvia, Prudie.

366
00:23:43,855 --> 00:23:45,846
Oh, I'm sorry. Sylvia Avila.

367
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:48,859
- So, how do you feel about <i>Mansfield Park?</i>
- My favorite.

368
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:51,452
- I love Fanny Price.
- Stop, Mom, why?

369
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:52,758
She's such a goodie-goodie.

370
00:23:52,831 --> 00:23:55,095
Six books, five people.
We skip <i>Northanger Abbey.</i>

371
00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:57,294
- Definitely.
- And miss out on Mr. Tilney?

372
00:23:57,369 --> 00:23:59,769
- No, you're right.
- He's such a flirt.

373
00:23:59,838 --> 00:24:01,430
We don't have to do all six books, do we?

374
00:24:01,506 --> 00:24:04,373
Doing all six novels
is the <i>raison d'etre</i> of the book club

375
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:06,809
and it is the only reason I'm here.

376
00:24:06,878 --> 00:24:09,608
- Okay.
- Do you wanna invite your husband?

377
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:24,584
My husband has never read Austen
and he never will.

378
00:24:24,663 --> 00:24:25,652
Okay, how should we do this?

379
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:27,630
Just meet once a month
at each of our houses, potluck...

380
00:24:27,699 --> 00:24:29,132
Or, you know, pick some central location.

381
00:24:29,201 --> 00:24:30,828
No, I don't think a coffee shop's conducive.

382
00:24:30,902 --> 00:24:32,927
I'll host the first one, we'll start with <i>Emma,</i>
at my place.

383
00:24:33,004 --> 00:24:34,437
But let's not get into this
competitive cooking thing.

384
00:24:34,506 --> 00:24:35,734
Bakeoffs!

385
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:37,638
- No, we'll do finger foods.
- We're gonna do takeout.

386
00:24:37,709 --> 00:24:40,542
And we have to create
the Jane Austen mood.

387
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:43,047
- Oh, my God.
- Hey.

388
00:24:43,114 --> 00:24:44,342
- He came.
- Yeah.

389
00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:47,749
Sorry, I sat in the wrong Starbucks
for half an hour.

390
00:24:52,557 --> 00:24:55,390
Golly, there are a lot of these places, huh?

391
00:24:55,460 --> 00:25:00,022
But they've got interesting coffee
from all over the world, so...

392
00:25:02,567 --> 00:25:05,730
- This is Grigg, everyone.
- I'm Bernadette.

393
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:07,968
- Prudie.
- Prudie, and Allegra.

394
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:09,700
- Sylvia.
- Grigg Harris.

395
00:25:11,977 --> 00:25:13,035
Hi.

396
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,541
Well, I'm excited.

397
00:25:16,648 --> 00:25:20,049
Never read anything by Jane Austen before.

398
00:25:22,821 --> 00:25:23,845
What is it?

399
00:25:23,922 --> 00:25:26,857
Well, I went to the bookstore
to buy a copy of each one of the novels,

400
00:25:26,925 --> 00:25:27,914
and I saw this.

401
00:25:27,993 --> 00:25:29,961
And I thought,
"Well, maybe they're all sequels."

402
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:33,122
So, I figured it might be a good idea
to keep them all together in one book,

403
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:35,826
in case I needed to refer back.

404
00:25:35,901 --> 00:25:37,960
Is this the order that we read them in?

405
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:41,005
Do you wanna grab a coffee, Grigg?

406
00:25:41,072 --> 00:25:44,564
No, no. No, I'm fine.
I had plenty at the other place.

407
00:25:44,643 --> 00:25:48,807
And... I bought this and they filled it up
for me, so I'm a little...

408
00:25:50,282 --> 00:25:51,271
Yeah.

409
00:25:51,349 --> 00:25:55,080
Oh, you said in your email
there was someone you wanted me to meet?

410
00:25:55,153 --> 00:25:59,180
Yeah. Yeah, all of us, actually.

411
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:02,089
I thought we might benefit
from the perspective of a male in the group.

412
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,560
- A little testosterone.
- Right.

413
00:26:04,629 --> 00:26:08,497
- Okay. So, none of you ladies are married?
- Prudie.

414
00:26:15,106 --> 00:26:18,598
Right, so we just... What?
We just read them chronologically, and...

415
00:26:18,677 --> 00:26:21,612
- We're doing <i>Emma</i> first.
<i>- Emma?</i>

416
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,580
Oh. Starting in the middle, huh?

417
00:26:23,648 --> 00:26:26,446
- They're not sequels.
- They're not?

418
00:26:26,518 --> 00:26:29,316
Well, great. We just start anywhere.

419
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:35,182
- What were you smoking?
- He's cute.

420
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,956
I thought he'd be a distraction for Sylvia.

421
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:40,793
She needs an adventure.
If he becomes a problem I'll get rid of him.

422
00:26:40,865 --> 00:26:44,028
- What happened, you pull a DUI?
- No, no, I pretty much bike everywhere.

423
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:45,535
Where do you live?

424
00:26:46,538 --> 00:26:49,701
About 20 miles north. Vista Mar.

425
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:53,107
- You live in what, that development?
- Yeah. Yeah.

426
00:26:53,178 --> 00:26:56,670
I had this software company
and my accountant says to me,

427
00:26:56,748 --> 00:26:57,976
"You gotta buy a house."

428
00:26:58,049 --> 00:27:00,108
So, we were right by that exit.

429
00:27:00,185 --> 00:27:03,621
And I said, "Pull over."

430
00:27:03,688 --> 00:27:06,156
Got out, went in, pointed, bought a house.

431
00:27:06,224 --> 00:27:08,385
- Like that.
- I should sell it, I guess.

432
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:11,327
Or at least buy some furniture.

433
00:27:11,396 --> 00:27:13,626
Well, I guess I'll have to,
if you guys are coming over, right?

434
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,061
Allegra.

435
00:27:16,735 --> 00:27:18,566
- Bye.
- Yeah. Sayonara.

436
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:23,039
You know, I never picked a book.

437
00:27:23,108 --> 00:27:26,077
Could I do that abbey one?

438
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:28,578
- Perfect. Yeah, it's yours.
- Oh, <i>Northanger Abbey.</i>

439
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:30,638
Great. All right.

440
00:27:30,715 --> 00:27:33,275
<i>- Emma.</i> Starting in the middle.
- Yeah.

441
00:27:39,357 --> 00:27:42,292
Well, you gotta hand it to him
for taking the dud book.

442
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,725
It's the shortest, that's why.

443
00:27:43,795 --> 00:27:46,491
- He's eager to please.
- Prudie, see you next time.

444
00:27:46,564 --> 00:27:48,896
He is eager to please. He likes women.

445
00:27:48,967 --> 00:27:51,936
- A welcome quality in a man.
- Yes. Yes.

446
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:56,667
- Do you think Sylvia responded to him?
- We let him in. It's done.

447
00:27:56,741 --> 00:27:58,936
- Bye.
- Bye. Bye.

448
00:28:17,128 --> 00:28:18,459
You're up.

449
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:31,171
Go big!

450
00:29:19,791 --> 00:29:21,053
You okay?

451
00:29:24,028 --> 00:29:26,588
Hey. Hey, you. Listen.

452
00:29:26,664 --> 00:29:29,360
Can you make sure
they don't call my mother? Please.

453
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:32,232
Just make sure they don't call my mother.

454
00:29:33,505 --> 00:29:36,269
Mrs. Avila? This is Corinne.

455
00:29:36,341 --> 00:29:40,334
- I'm a friend of Allegra's.
- Allegra's.

456
00:29:40,411 --> 00:29:43,107
And she's asked me to call you.

457
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:45,672
We're up here in Vacaville at a...

458
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:47,217
- Jewelry show.
...jewelry show.

459
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:52,120
I was showing her how to use my scooter
and she took a little spill.

460
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:54,590
It's minor. She banged up her wrist.

461
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:58,390
She doesn't need you to come. It's nothing.
We're at the doctor's.

462
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:00,931
He says she could be a bit sore.

463
00:30:02,567 --> 00:30:06,264
Allegra didn't want you to worry
if she's not home tonight.

464
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:09,902
I'll remind her. Book club Monday night.

465
00:31:31,422 --> 00:31:32,753
I'm sorry.

466
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:37,695
We don't shop on this side of town, ever.

467
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:42,627
Sorry.

468
00:31:44,102 --> 00:31:48,095
You can have this Whole Foods.
We won't ever use it again. Okay?

469
00:31:58,783 --> 00:32:03,220
So I was getting the wine for book club
and I bumped into Daniel.

470
00:32:03,288 --> 00:32:04,312
He was with her.

471
00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:05,879
<i>- Oh, sweetie.</i>
- Yeah.

472
00:32:05,957 --> 00:32:08,482
They were going home to make dinner.

473
00:32:09,027 --> 00:32:11,587
He was wearing a jacket with a zipper.

474
00:32:11,663 --> 00:32:14,223
- No.
<i>- That's so not Daniel.</i>

475
00:32:15,233 --> 00:32:20,193
I just... I walk around this house,
and it's not my home anymore.

476
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:23,399
I feel like Fanny Price
banished from Mansfield Park.

477
00:32:23,474 --> 00:32:27,740
- That woman is living my life.
- Honey, she can't live your life.

478
00:32:27,812 --> 00:32:29,643
<i>Are you all right?</i>

479
00:32:29,714 --> 00:32:34,174
I know you like being alone,
but don't you ever get Ionely?

480
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:42,290
So what'd you think about Grigg?

481
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:45,357
The book club guy.

482
00:32:46,097 --> 00:32:47,462
If you like him, I like him.

483
00:32:47,532 --> 00:32:51,195
- How about those dreamy eyes?
- I didn't really notice.

484
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:52,463
Well, notice.

485
00:32:52,537 --> 00:32:55,529
Can you come early tomorrow
since you're bringing the wine?

486
00:32:55,606 --> 00:32:59,064
That's my girls. That's my girls.
That's my girls.

487
00:32:59,177 --> 00:33:01,645
It's a smallish world, pedigreed Ridgebacks.

488
00:33:01,713 --> 00:33:05,308
- "Pedigreed" is...
- Well, it's breeding.

489
00:33:05,383 --> 00:33:07,943
Certain bloodlines
are naturally more valuable.

490
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:12,285
Mine are out of Queenie of the Serengeti.
Gorgeous hound. Gone now.

491
00:33:13,257 --> 00:33:16,886
I bred her to my first
really important sire, Pridey.

492
00:33:16,961 --> 00:33:21,159
Sire's the boy dog. Great disposition.
Passed away last month.

493
00:33:21,232 --> 00:33:23,223
- I'm sorry.
- Thank you.

494
00:33:23,301 --> 00:33:26,737
Miss him. But Queenie was the real star.

495
00:33:26,804 --> 00:33:31,002
Ridgebacks are matriarchal.
That's one of their attractive features.

496
00:33:31,075 --> 00:33:33,737
Hey, hey, hey! Sahara, off!

497
00:33:33,811 --> 00:33:35,802
Sorry. Sorry about that.

498
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:40,442
Sahara I had to have spayed.
Thyroid issues.

499
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:45,148
I still show her, though.
She's very competitive in her category.

500
00:33:45,223 --> 00:33:48,192
- Yeah?
- Sexually altered bitch.

501
00:33:52,764 --> 00:33:54,163
Well, I got you those books.

502
00:33:54,232 --> 00:33:57,224
You know the ones I suggested?
Ursula Le Guin.

503
00:33:57,335 --> 00:34:00,862
Oh, yeah. Thanks, that was thoughtful.

504
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:05,041
You don't have to bring a hostess gift
to these meetings, FYI.

505
00:34:05,109 --> 00:34:06,974
It's just a book club.

506
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,944
Where's the heat
between Emma and Mr. Knightley?

507
00:34:12,016 --> 00:34:13,745
There's no animal passion.

508
00:34:13,818 --> 00:34:16,286
Look at Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax.

509
00:34:16,354 --> 00:34:19,016
You can tell they're really in love
because they behave so badly.

510
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:20,079
And that's good?

511
00:34:20,158 --> 00:34:25,425
Emma and Mr. Knightley,
you just never feel the sex.

512
00:34:26,097 --> 00:34:29,089
Still, I think Mr. Knightley's very yummy.
Don't you?

513
00:34:29,167 --> 00:34:32,068
He may be my favorite of all the Austen men.

514
00:34:32,136 --> 00:34:34,468
<i>Sans passion I'amour n'est rien.</i>

515
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:37,903
- That's not Jane's theme, is it?
- Jane?

516
00:34:37,975 --> 00:34:39,442
That's cozy.

517
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:44,976
What we're meant to see
is not the lack of passion

518
00:34:45,049 --> 00:34:48,280
so much as the control of it,
and the not giving in.

519
00:34:48,352 --> 00:34:50,183
<i>Apres moi, le deluge.</i>

520
00:34:51,556 --> 00:34:54,491
But Prudie's right, it is in all the novels.

521
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,719
<i>Sense and Sensibility,</i> obviously.

522
00:34:56,794 --> 00:34:59,558
Oh, and then there's Maria's infidelity
in <i>Mansfield Park.</i>

523
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:01,860
I forgot there's infidelity in <i>Mansfield Park.</i>

524
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:03,457
Austen's all about keeping it zipped.

525
00:35:03,534 --> 00:35:08,164
Yeah, but isn't physical attraction
one of the ungovernable forces?

526
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:11,106
You know, like gravity.
That's what we like about it.

527
00:35:11,175 --> 00:35:16,238
You know, downhill, release the brakes,
loosen your grip, and...

528
00:35:16,314 --> 00:35:18,544
Yeah. Love makes people crazy.

529
00:35:18,649 --> 00:35:21,777
- It does not excuse bad behavior.
- I agree.

530
00:35:21,853 --> 00:35:25,812
And Mr. Knightley is violently in love.
"Violently!" His word.

531
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:27,949
And yet, he's never anything
but a gentleman.

532
00:35:28,025 --> 00:35:30,721
- Yeah, a gentleman who scolds people.
- Not everyone.

533
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:33,423
You know, just Emma,
just the woman that he loves.

534
00:35:33,498 --> 00:35:35,728
<i>C'est vrai. C'est typique.</i>

535
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,098
A man can do whatever he likes
to the woman he loves.

536
00:35:38,169 --> 00:35:40,034
I don't think that's what Austen's saying.

537
00:35:40,104 --> 00:35:43,267
Actually, Emma stops being crazy
when she falls for Mr. Knightley.

538
00:35:43,341 --> 00:35:46,071
It's the event of the book.
Love is an act of sanity.

539
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:49,602
One thing that I noticed about <i>Emma</i>
is the sense of menace.

540
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:53,548
The gypsies,
Jane Fairfax's boating accident,

541
00:35:53,618 --> 00:35:54,710
Mr. Woodhouse's worries.

542
00:35:54,785 --> 00:35:58,448
Austen's entire thesis is that
none of these things are real, Grigg.

543
00:35:58,523 --> 00:36:02,983
I mean, Emma, she acts
on the basis of her fantasies.

544
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:05,620
Yes, Grigg, I'm afraid
you've just entirely missed the point.

545
00:36:05,696 --> 00:36:07,425
You know, I've read that the <i>Emma</i> plot,

546
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:11,127
the humbling of the pretty, know-it-all girl
is the most popular plot of all time.

547
00:36:11,202 --> 00:36:13,329
Yes, universally satisfying.

548
00:36:15,072 --> 00:36:17,233
Okay. Well, what bothered me

549
00:36:17,308 --> 00:36:20,505
was how Emma kept forcing
her friend Harriet on Mr. Elton.

550
00:36:20,578 --> 00:36:22,239
And then she finds out
who Harriet's father is,

551
00:36:22,313 --> 00:36:24,372
and suddenly, "Ew!"
She's lucky to get the farmer.

552
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:27,815
I think Jane was being ironic there.
I think some readers might miss that.

553
00:36:27,885 --> 00:36:29,716
- Emma's a snob.
- Please.

554
00:36:29,787 --> 00:36:33,223
People are instinctively drawn to partners
who are their near equal in looks.

555
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:36,124
The pretty marry the pretty,
the ugly the ugly.

556
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:38,560
To the detriment of the breed,
in my opinion.

557
00:36:38,629 --> 00:36:41,655
God, you're such an Emma. Isn't she?

558
00:36:41,766 --> 00:36:44,792
You'd love to pair up the whole world,
from dogs to people.

559
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:47,064
Put me together with Daniel.

560
00:36:50,508 --> 00:36:52,806
And you had beautiful children.

561
00:36:55,780 --> 00:37:00,342
Oh, no, don't get up, Jocelyn.
I'll get the tea. Sorry.

562
00:37:03,454 --> 00:37:04,682
Mom.

563
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:29,072
I hope we didn't scare Grigg away.

564
00:37:29,146 --> 00:37:33,344
- Yeah, he sure got out of here fast.
- Yeah, we'll toughen him up.

565
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:34,884
Was the book club a bad idea?

566
00:37:34,952 --> 00:37:38,820
Austen has a way of making you forget
that most marriages end in divorce.

567
00:37:38,889 --> 00:37:41,050
Well, she's all about the weddings, Jane.

568
00:37:41,125 --> 00:37:42,990
Yeah, "Jane." Did you catch that?

569
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:46,359
Oh, Prudie?
"Jane and I, we know our themes."

570
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:48,762
And why did she have to speak in French?

571
00:37:48,833 --> 00:37:52,826
And if so, couldn't she do it in France,
where it's less noticeable?

572
00:37:52,903 --> 00:37:56,634
I feel for Prudie.
She's married to a complete Neanderthal.

573
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:02,473
Okay, I will call you when I land in Dallas.
You know what?

574
00:38:02,546 --> 00:38:05,037
Let me call you when I check in the hotel
if there's time before the game,

575
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:07,209
- 'cause we're gonna wanna get there early.
- Whatever, okay.

576
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:09,048
Have fun with your mom.

577
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,815
- Hey, Sky. Hi.
- Hi.

578
00:38:10,888 --> 00:38:13,220
Mom, you were supposed
to sit with the car.

579
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:14,622
I'm gonna get a ticket!

580
00:38:14,692 --> 00:38:16,557
- Yo!
- Get some ass!

581
00:38:17,862 --> 00:38:19,887
So... Hey, what're we doing today?

582
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:22,194
Well, I'm teaching. It's a school day, okay?

583
00:38:22,266 --> 00:38:23,290
So I'm gonna drop you at the house.

584
00:38:23,367 --> 00:38:25,733
Or you can take the car
and you can go see a movie or something.

585
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:28,169
- No, no, I'll hang with you.
- No, no, you can't.

586
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:30,070
They don't allow that.

587
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:32,871
Mom, could you... Oh, my God, please.

588
00:38:34,045 --> 00:38:35,910
Okay, I can't.

589
00:38:37,448 --> 00:38:39,348
Mom, I'm late. Please. Come on.

590
00:38:39,417 --> 00:38:41,317
Oh, ditch them. Blow them off.

591
00:38:41,385 --> 00:38:45,617
Tell them your mother doesn't wanna
hang around while you go to work.

592
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:52,393
What's the story with the clothes?
You dress like a flight attendant.

593
00:38:52,463 --> 00:38:56,126
No, I dress like a teacher.
Or it gets confusing.

594
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:59,169
Mom, mind your stupid... For everyone.

595
00:38:59,236 --> 00:39:01,431
Why would anyone
wanna teach high school?

596
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:02,972
I hated my teachers.

597
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,270
Well, I'm just gonna settle you at the house.

598
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:09,109
No, I'll drop you at school
and then I'll take the car.

599
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,341
- Should you be driving?
- Huh?

600
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:17,280
Okay, you know what?
Just don't forget to come get me at 3:00.

601
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:19,118
Okay? Don't forget.

602
00:39:29,834 --> 00:39:33,292
I'm in <i>Brigadoon.</i>
Would you mind running lines with me?

603
00:39:34,805 --> 00:39:35,931
"Of course I'm all right."

604
00:39:36,006 --> 00:39:38,201
"I'd have died
if anything had happened to you.

605
00:39:38,275 --> 00:39:40,266
"I love you so."

606
00:39:40,344 --> 00:39:42,312
"But how can you be sure in just one day?"

607
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,642
"I dinna know, 'tis just

608
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:47,548
"when a lass falls in and out of love,
she knows it right away."

609
00:39:48,986 --> 00:39:51,750
- What?
- It's a good accent.

610
00:39:51,822 --> 00:39:53,915
Well, languages are my speciality.
I just thought that...

611
00:39:53,991 --> 00:39:55,754
French teacher.

612
00:39:58,963 --> 00:40:00,828
It's your line.

613
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:02,991
"Do you think you're in love with me?"

614
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:04,864
"Think? What good does thinking do?

615
00:40:04,935 --> 00:40:06,835
"But what I feel is something else."

616
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:09,134
"What do ye feel then, Tommy?"

617
00:40:10,775 --> 00:40:12,470
And then we kiss.

618
00:40:14,645 --> 00:40:16,875
Who plays opposite you?

619
00:40:18,282 --> 00:40:19,749
Karen Bhave.

620
00:40:21,652 --> 00:40:26,316
I think she only tried out because
she thought we'd hook up during the play.

621
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:34,924
I saw you watching me in the library.

622
00:40:34,999 --> 00:40:38,059
- I wasn't watching.
- You were watching.

623
00:40:38,135 --> 00:40:39,796
No, I was reading.

624
00:40:40,571 --> 00:40:43,267
- You were watching.
- I was reading this...

625
00:40:45,009 --> 00:40:46,601
- I was reading this book...
- Oh, yeah?

626
00:40:46,677 --> 00:40:49,441
...about some people
in this house called Mansfield Park.

627
00:40:49,513 --> 00:40:50,605
- Austen.
- Yeah.

628
00:40:50,681 --> 00:40:54,344
We're doing <i>Mansfield Park</i>
for senior seminar, so...

629
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:58,821
I actually bought the book already.
I'm trying to make myself wait, you know?

630
00:41:00,758 --> 00:41:04,387
Delay gratification. That sort of thing.

631
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:10,699
- So what happens?
- Right, well...

632
00:41:10,768 --> 00:41:13,362
Well, they decide to put on a play
in the house.

633
00:41:13,437 --> 00:41:17,203
And rehearsing it, it sort of unleashes them.

634
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:20,072
Two of them actually fall in love, and one...

635
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:23,477
One of them, Maria Bertram, is set... Stop it.

636
00:41:23,547 --> 00:41:26,038
- Is set to marry someone else.
- Or maybe not.

637
00:41:26,116 --> 00:41:28,107
Well, I think... I think...

638
00:41:28,185 --> 00:41:32,178
I think what Austen is trying to say
is that play-acting is dangerous.

639
00:41:32,256 --> 00:41:36,556
All of that intimacy backstage,
the waiting and the whispering,

640
00:41:36,627 --> 00:41:42,224
and onstage you're gazing at each other,
and "I love you."

641
00:41:42,299 --> 00:41:43,630
I mean...

642
00:41:45,069 --> 00:41:46,730
Well, you can see how it happens.

643
00:41:46,804 --> 00:41:50,535
Yeah, I can see it happening,
just not with Karen Bhave.

644
00:41:51,909 --> 00:41:54,343
So, do you wanna go over it again?

645
00:42:22,473 --> 00:42:23,667
Hello?

646
00:42:31,015 --> 00:42:32,983
- Yeah.
- Hey, Grigg, it's Jocelyn.

647
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:34,608
- Hi. Hey.
<i>- Hi.</i>

648
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:38,716
<i>- So how's</i> Mansfield Park <i>coming?</i>
- Just great.

649
00:42:38,789 --> 00:42:40,154
Am I disturbing you?

650
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:44,456
I'm just writing an email to my sisters
about you, as a matter of fact.

651
00:42:44,528 --> 00:42:46,052
<i>And Ursula Le Guin.</i>

652
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:49,031
- Did you ever read <i>Left Hand of Darkness?</i>
<i>- Not yet.</i>

653
00:42:49,133 --> 00:42:50,623
<i>Hey, listen, Bernadette and I</i>
<i>were just saying</i>

654
00:42:50,701 --> 00:42:53,761
we hope Allegra didn't
scare you off the book club.

655
00:42:53,837 --> 00:42:56,169
- Which one is Allegra?
<i>- Sylvia's daughter.</i>

656
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,606
Really pretty, really passionate,
wonderful girl.

657
00:42:58,676 --> 00:43:00,803
Ask him if he can make time today.

658
00:43:00,878 --> 00:43:02,675
You might take Sylvia to lunch today.

659
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:05,943
Tell him that Sylvia and Daniel are
in court this morning over their separation.

660
00:43:06,016 --> 00:43:07,677
She could use the ego boost.

661
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:10,151
<i>You have Sylvia's number, right?</i>

662
00:43:12,523 --> 00:43:14,957
Would you wanna come, too?

663
00:43:15,025 --> 00:43:17,220
Listen, I know
there's a difference in your ages,

664
00:43:17,294 --> 00:43:19,888
but I really think
the two of you will hit it off.

665
00:43:19,964 --> 00:43:22,831
Sahara. I gotta go, okay?

666
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:33,042
<i>This woman I like</i>
<i>definitely seems interested, but it's weird.</i>

667
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:37,877
<i>She's sort of pushing me to date this girl,</i>
<i>Allegra, who's way younger than me.</i>

668
00:43:41,919 --> 00:43:45,184
<i>She said I should</i>
<i>take this girl's mother to lunch.</i>

669
00:43:51,161 --> 00:43:53,686
Bank assets will be divided equally.

670
00:43:54,565 --> 00:43:57,090
Each individual will keep his or her own car,

671
00:43:57,167 --> 00:44:01,729
and each will be wholly responsible
for the attendant payments and insurance.

672
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:05,605
The house owned by Daniel and Sylvia
will be jointly held,

673
00:44:05,676 --> 00:44:10,704
with both parties paying an equal share of
property taxes, upkeep and repairs.

674
00:44:10,781 --> 00:44:13,909
Sylvia may live in the house. Daniel will not.

675
00:44:30,801 --> 00:44:33,793
As soon as Daniel hit 50, his wheels fell off.

676
00:44:33,871 --> 00:44:35,395
Here's what I get from <i>Mansfield Park.</i>

677
00:44:35,472 --> 00:44:38,635
That a marriage is only as strong
as its weakest partner.

678
00:44:38,709 --> 00:44:41,769
Daniel has always wanted
to find his center by wobbling.

679
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:43,403
This is a pretty big wobble.

680
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:45,107
<i>Mansfield Park</i> is full of wobblers.

681
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:49,642
Lady Bertram lying around,
letting a houseful of adolescents run riot.

682
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:51,347
Fanny Price is the rock of that family.

683
00:44:51,422 --> 00:44:54,152
Fanny's cousin Maria, married six months,
dumps her husband...

684
00:44:54,224 --> 00:44:56,818
And don't forget Fanny's father,
the unemployed alcoholic.

685
00:44:56,894 --> 00:44:59,260
Marry the weak link and you're screwed.
That's what she's saying.

686
00:44:59,329 --> 00:45:02,423
No wonder why Austen never married.
It's terrifying.

687
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:06,302
- I think I finally hate him.
- Good.

688
00:45:08,405 --> 00:45:12,603
I'm home. I'm going out again.
I have book club.

689
00:45:28,325 --> 00:45:31,192
You just missed this guy

690
00:45:31,261 --> 00:45:37,757
who got buried up to his neck
in a tank filled with cockroaches.

691
00:45:37,835 --> 00:45:39,700
And they were real.

692
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:44,238
You'd think it'd be illegal
to show stuff like that.

693
00:45:44,308 --> 00:45:46,071
Here, grab a spoon.

694
00:45:48,979 --> 00:45:50,708
You have to leave.

695
00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:57,314
You put your things in your suitcase
'cause I'm booking your flight.

696
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,231
- Want me to...
- Yeah.

697
00:46:13,570 --> 00:46:15,561
- How did you break it?
- I fell.

698
00:46:15,639 --> 00:46:16,901
Which was kind of lucky, actually.

699
00:46:16,974 --> 00:46:21,138
'Cause I met this girl, Corinne,
who I've been seeing. She's a writer.

700
00:46:21,211 --> 00:46:22,200
Which, um,

701
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:25,172
isn't so great, really,

702
00:46:25,249 --> 00:46:27,774
'cause if she had to choose
between me and writing,

703
00:46:27,851 --> 00:46:30,581
she'd probably choose writing.

704
00:46:30,654 --> 00:46:33,680
But she doesn't ever have to choose.
So you never have to know.

705
00:46:33,757 --> 00:46:37,158
So you're a lesbian. Full-time?

706
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:41,860
You mean, do I ever slip
and accidentally sleep with a man?

707
00:46:41,932 --> 00:46:45,732
No, no, my sister Cat,
she goes out with guys and girls.

708
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:47,100
She lives in Idaho.

709
00:46:47,171 --> 00:46:49,662
Your sister isn't Cat Harris.

710
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:51,708
- You know her?
- Bernadette knows everyone.

711
00:46:51,775 --> 00:46:56,439
I met her through my doctor friend
in Laguna Niguel, Bianca Sillman.

712
00:46:56,513 --> 00:46:58,413
You know my sister, Bianca?

713
00:46:58,482 --> 00:47:00,609
I forgot that Bianca and Cat are sisters.

714
00:47:00,684 --> 00:47:03,551
Those are your sisters!

715
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:05,986
Our world is an English village.

716
00:47:08,458 --> 00:47:11,689
My topic is the long-suffering daughter.

717
00:47:11,762 --> 00:47:14,322
One can't help but see the parallels

718
00:47:14,398 --> 00:47:17,424
between the long-suffering
Fanny Price in <i>Mansfield Park</i>

719
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:19,867
and the long-suffering Anne Eliot
in <i>Persuasion.</i>

720
00:47:19,937 --> 00:47:21,404
I hate Fanny Price.

721
00:47:21,471 --> 00:47:25,066
Excuse me, we're not electing
the homecoming queen, okay?

722
00:47:25,142 --> 00:47:27,804
I mean, yes, if this were high school, yes,

723
00:47:27,878 --> 00:47:30,574
we all know Elizabeth Bennet
would be most popular

724
00:47:30,647 --> 00:47:32,239
and that Fanny would be least.

725
00:47:32,316 --> 00:47:35,376
- Who's Elizabeth Bennet?
- Of <i>Pride and Prejudice.</i>

726
00:47:36,787 --> 00:47:39,153
Don't give away too much,
'cause I haven't read that one yet.

727
00:47:39,223 --> 00:47:41,987
- You don't know <i>Pride and Prejudice?</i>
- No.

728
00:47:42,059 --> 00:47:44,960
I think I read somewhere that Fanny Price
was Austen's favorite.

729
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:47,292
- Fanny's boring.
- She's faithful.

730
00:47:47,364 --> 00:47:50,162
She's <i>Horton Hatches the Egg.</i>

731
00:47:50,234 --> 00:47:52,828
She sits on that nest
and she never, ever wavers.

732
00:47:52,903 --> 00:47:55,167
Well, she'd probably be easier to like

733
00:47:55,239 --> 00:47:57,400
if she would just
allow some weakness in others.

734
00:47:57,474 --> 00:47:59,499
- She doesn't allow it in herself.
- True.

735
00:47:59,576 --> 00:48:02,841
I didn't see what was so bad
about Henry Crawford.

736
00:48:02,913 --> 00:48:05,677
Yes. Thank you, Grigg.
Why does it have to be Edmund?

737
00:48:05,749 --> 00:48:09,014
Well, Austen, she's always suspicious
of people who are too charming.

738
00:48:09,086 --> 00:48:11,782
Just once I'd like to pick up <i>Mansfield Park</i>

739
00:48:11,855 --> 00:48:15,154
and see Fanny end up in the sack
with Henry Crawford.

740
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:16,214
Yes! Yes!

741
00:48:16,326 --> 00:48:18,055
You can't read these novels
without wondering

742
00:48:18,128 --> 00:48:19,993
if she doesn't have a little thing
for the naughty boys.

743
00:48:20,063 --> 00:48:21,360
Well, who doesn't?

744
00:48:21,431 --> 00:48:23,399
Except for Fanny Price.

745
00:48:23,467 --> 00:48:27,631
Okay, look. I love Fanny. She works hard.

746
00:48:27,704 --> 00:48:30,298
- She puts her family's needs above her own.
- Mom, it's okay.

747
00:48:30,374 --> 00:48:33,241
And she never, ever
stops loving Edmund, ever.

748
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:35,778
Even when he's stupid enough
to do something like

749
00:48:35,846 --> 00:48:38,041
take up with Mary Crawford.

750
00:48:45,422 --> 00:48:46,889
Oh, dear.

751
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:50,458
I thought <i>Mansfield Park</i> would be safe,
didn't you?

752
00:48:50,527 --> 00:48:52,757
I don't think we're gonna get through
all six books.

753
00:48:52,829 --> 00:48:56,390
Reading Jane Austen is a freaking minefield.

754
00:48:57,234 --> 00:49:00,101
You're awfully quiet, Grigg. Any thoughts?

755
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:02,363
Yeah.

756
00:49:16,219 --> 00:49:17,345
Yeah. Yes!

757
00:49:17,421 --> 00:49:20,413
The relationship
between Edmund and Fanny.

758
00:49:20,490 --> 00:49:22,924
They seemed like brother and sister.

759
00:49:22,993 --> 00:49:26,622
But then in the end,
it's like <i>The Empire Strikes Back,</i>

760
00:49:26,697 --> 00:49:32,397
but it's in reverse. You know?
'Cause in <i>Jedi,</i> Luke Skywalker,

761
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:35,632
he gets over Princess Leia
when she turns out to be his sister.

762
00:49:35,706 --> 00:49:40,905
Edmund gets over Miss Crawford and gets it
on with Fanny, who's his first cousin, so...

763
00:49:48,752 --> 00:49:50,845
Did that bother anybody else?

764
00:49:50,921 --> 00:49:53,981
- Weren't you gonna call Sylvia for lunch?
- Oh, yeah.

765
00:49:54,057 --> 00:49:56,958
- You know Allegra's gay, right?
- Of course.

766
00:49:58,362 --> 00:50:00,796
Oh. I love your furniture, in your house.

767
00:50:00,864 --> 00:50:03,628
And before we do <i>Northanger Abbey,</i>
I gotta buy a couch, so...

768
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:06,498
- Is something going on between these two?
- Grigg, you have to...

769
00:50:06,570 --> 00:50:08,936
Would you come with me,
help me pick it out?

770
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:11,338
If you take Sylvia to lunch.

771
00:50:15,545 --> 00:50:16,705
Great.

772
00:50:17,381 --> 00:50:19,110
Good, that's great.

773
00:50:19,583 --> 00:50:21,244
- Okay, see you.
- All right, yup, here.

774
00:50:21,318 --> 00:50:23,411
- Take care.
- Oh, God. Sorry.

775
00:50:23,954 --> 00:50:26,445
I caught him staring at my titties.

776
00:50:28,825 --> 00:50:30,224
I like that.

777
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:39,298
- I like this.
- That color's difficult.

778
00:50:41,138 --> 00:50:44,198
I like things that are difficult. I'll take it.

779
00:50:46,076 --> 00:50:48,374
Wait, you just don't buy
the first one you like.

780
00:50:48,445 --> 00:50:51,209
- You don't even know if it'll fit.
- What? It's fine.

781
00:50:51,281 --> 00:50:53,078
You getting hungry?

782
00:50:55,385 --> 00:50:58,877
Grigg, I don't mean to be rude,
but may I ask,

783
00:50:59,256 --> 00:51:01,349
do you have a lot of money?

784
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:04,190
Never know how to answer that.

785
00:51:05,095 --> 00:51:06,960
Yeah, I have enough money.

786
00:51:07,030 --> 00:51:10,022
But, you know,
I like working in tech support.

787
00:51:11,134 --> 00:51:12,601
- May I?
- Sure.

788
00:51:13,703 --> 00:51:15,568
You should bring Sylvia here.
It's so romantic.

789
00:51:15,639 --> 00:51:17,732
You know, she's planning
this library fundraiser.

790
00:51:17,808 --> 00:51:19,673
- She's busy.
- Call her.

791
00:51:20,310 --> 00:51:22,175
It's hard to be alone.

792
00:51:26,183 --> 00:51:27,980
- Well, maybe her husband will come back.
- Maybe.

793
00:51:28,051 --> 00:51:30,212
Jane Austen should write that.

794
00:51:30,287 --> 00:51:32,482
She did. In <i>Persuasion.</i>

795
00:51:32,556 --> 00:51:36,219
Anne Eliot is in love with this guy
Wentworth who's in the navy, right?

796
00:51:36,293 --> 00:51:38,261
But her family thinks that
he's not good enough.

797
00:51:38,328 --> 00:51:39,659
- Right.
- So he leaves.

798
00:51:39,729 --> 00:51:41,560
And when he comes back
he's become this wealthy man.

799
00:51:41,631 --> 00:51:45,624
- But he's no longer in love with her.
- Okay. Don't tell me any more.

800
00:51:45,702 --> 00:51:51,072
- Oh, so you're enjoying the Austen, I see.
- Yeah. And how's the Ursula Le Guin?

801
00:51:53,477 --> 00:51:56,469
- You didn't like Le Guin?
- I didn't read them.

802
00:51:56,913 --> 00:51:58,904
How are you gonna know what you like
unless you try?

803
00:51:58,982 --> 00:52:00,313
I think at my age I should know what I like.

804
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:01,509
Age? Come on, age.

805
00:52:01,585 --> 00:52:02,916
Age has nothing to do with anything.

806
00:52:02,986 --> 00:52:06,183
I was willing to read girly books
like Jane Austen...

807
00:52:06,256 --> 00:52:07,280
She is not girly.

808
00:52:07,357 --> 00:52:08,949
Which I found out.

809
00:52:09,025 --> 00:52:11,892
So maybe you would find out
that science fiction's not just...

810
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:14,294
- Aliens on rocket ships.
- Right.

811
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:19,796
All right, hurry up and finish.
I'm gonna show you something really cool.

812
00:52:19,870 --> 00:52:22,338
What you have to understand
is that when I was a kid,

813
00:52:22,405 --> 00:52:26,364
my dad and I
were basically surrounded by girls 24<i>l</i>7.

814
00:52:26,443 --> 00:52:29,310
You know, there was my mom,
my sisters, and their friends.

815
00:52:29,412 --> 00:52:32,381
So there'd be like 15 girls in the house.
It was insane.

816
00:52:32,449 --> 00:52:36,112
My dad would hide out in the shed
and no one was allowed back there.

817
00:52:36,186 --> 00:52:40,418
And he'd listen to ballgame,
you know, smoke his pipe.

818
00:52:40,557 --> 00:52:43,754
He actually died a couple years ago
of mouth cancer.

819
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:47,354
- I'm so sorry.
- Anyway, one day...

820
00:52:47,497 --> 00:52:49,931
I'm like 10 years old,
my dad takes me back to the shed

821
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:54,494
and he shows me some magazines
that he keeps back there.

822
00:52:54,604 --> 00:52:58,904
He says, "This is strictly guy stuff.
It's top secret. Very private.

823
00:52:58,975 --> 00:53:00,567
"Tell no one."

824
00:53:06,550 --> 00:53:08,381
Yeah, so from then on, it's like...

825
00:53:08,451 --> 00:53:12,182
I don't know...
It's like me and my dad and science fiction.

826
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:15,654
These were like the first books
that I fell in love with,

827
00:53:15,725 --> 00:53:17,693
and I never got over it.

828
00:53:18,995 --> 00:53:21,828
Arthur C. Clarke. He's a visionary writer.

829
00:53:22,399 --> 00:53:24,731
Theodore Sturgeon. Amazing.

830
00:53:26,603 --> 00:53:30,972
Philip K. Dick.
This was my top-secret all-guy world.

831
00:53:32,909 --> 00:53:35,605
- Andre Norton.
- Very manly.

832
00:53:36,146 --> 00:53:39,707
Except, as it turns out,
Andrew Norton, a.k.a. Andre Norton,

833
00:53:39,783 --> 00:53:43,480
- a.k.a. Alice Mary Norton.
- No way.

834
00:53:43,553 --> 00:53:45,282
- James Tiptree, Jr.
- I heard of him.

835
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:49,291
Real name, Alice Sheldon. Pat Murphy.

836
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:52,260
- Patrice Anne...
- You were still surrounded.

837
00:53:54,030 --> 00:53:56,328
But by that time I liked girls.

838
00:54:06,676 --> 00:54:09,372
You win. I'll read the Le Guin.

839
00:54:11,781 --> 00:54:13,009
Great.

840
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:29,625
- Tell me a secret.
- Your turn.

841
00:54:30,667 --> 00:54:34,228
No. You have better secrets.
You can trust me.

842
00:54:38,008 --> 00:54:39,873
Tell me.

843
00:54:42,746 --> 00:54:45,544
Okay, but this is not something
I would tell anyone else.

844
00:54:47,550 --> 00:54:50,951
There was this special needs kid
in the grade above me, Benny.

845
00:54:51,388 --> 00:54:55,484
He wore his hat squashed down
really low, and his ears stuck out.

846
00:54:55,558 --> 00:54:58,118
And he was always carrying around
this basketball and going...

847
00:55:01,097 --> 00:55:04,624
And, one day, I was in fourth grade,

848
00:55:05,235 --> 00:55:09,433
I saw that he was holding his penis.

849
00:55:09,539 --> 00:55:12,030
So, I just went back to my friends.

850
00:55:12,876 --> 00:55:15,174
Well, later my dad picked me up.

851
00:55:15,245 --> 00:55:18,214
And he was distracted,
just not really listening, and...

852
00:55:18,281 --> 00:55:20,044
And I don't know why, but...

853
00:55:20,116 --> 00:55:24,678
I said, "Dad, this boy at school
made me look at his penis."

854
00:55:24,788 --> 00:55:27,222
- Wait. What was his name?
- Benny.

855
00:55:27,357 --> 00:55:30,053
We actually got their address
and drove to their house.

856
00:55:30,126 --> 00:55:36,531
And Benny's mom answers the door.
I mean, she was old.

857
00:55:37,434 --> 00:55:41,200
She has these two long, skinny gray braids.
And my dad's yelling.

858
00:55:42,205 --> 00:55:46,369
And she starts crying.
"I'm sorry, what do you expect me to do?"

859
00:55:48,511 --> 00:55:52,242
And he says,
"I expect you to speak to your son."

860
00:55:52,816 --> 00:55:57,150
And then right behind her is Benny
with his stupid basketball, going...

861
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:04,058
And my dad just stops.

862
00:56:06,730 --> 00:56:10,222
'Cause he had a little brother like that
who died.

863
00:56:11,568 --> 00:56:13,001
Oh, my God.

864
00:56:13,069 --> 00:56:17,733
So we get back in the car
and my dad is just silent.

865
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:25,743
And then he says, "I think you knew

866
00:56:26,783 --> 00:56:29,946
"you were leaving out
the most important part."

867
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:34,383
And I just felt horrible.

868
00:56:35,325 --> 00:56:39,318
You know, I didn't really know
any of that was gonna happen.

869
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:44,097
I just wanted his attention.

870
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:03,351
Have you lost your mind?

871
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:07,254
I thought about... I thought about calling.

872
00:57:07,323 --> 00:57:12,022
- I... But I didn't wanna wake you.
- You can't just show up here, Daniel.

873
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:13,562
Somebody's gotta mow the lawn.
I don't mind.

874
00:57:13,630 --> 00:57:15,461
Well, I'll pay somebody.

875
00:57:15,532 --> 00:57:21,368
You know? I mean, this is my home.
You cannot just arrive here without asking.

876
00:57:21,571 --> 00:57:24,062
What if I had somebody staying over?

877
00:57:24,140 --> 00:57:27,906
- Are you seeing someone?
- Put the mower away.

878
00:57:27,977 --> 00:57:30,741
I didn't mean that in a weird kind of way.

879
00:57:32,849 --> 00:57:35,784
I just missed hearing what's going on here.

880
00:57:36,085 --> 00:57:41,216
Allegra, she acts like she hates me,
and the boys... I mean, Diego and Andy,

881
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:43,555
they call from school,
but they don't say much.

882
00:57:43,626 --> 00:57:45,958
They're ashamed of their father.

883
00:57:49,098 --> 00:57:52,932
So Diego says you told him
the handle on the shower's loose?

884
00:57:54,871 --> 00:57:57,271
- Thirty seconds.
- I'll deal with it.

885
00:57:58,141 --> 00:57:59,768
Is there something in the house
you don't want me to see?

886
00:57:59,843 --> 00:58:01,037
Do you think
I'm not taking care of the house?

887
00:58:01,110 --> 00:58:03,806
- No, no...
- You wanna do what a husband does?

888
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:05,677
You wanna fix things?

889
00:58:06,416 --> 00:58:08,179
You can't fix this.

890
00:58:09,085 --> 00:58:10,985
You're not my husband.

891
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:15,989
- All that's gone now.
- Can I call you next weekend?

892
00:58:16,059 --> 00:58:18,994
- No, you cannot call me next weekend.
- Okay.

893
00:58:19,362 --> 00:58:21,193
I'll check in with you, okay?

894
00:58:51,027 --> 00:58:53,655
My mom said I could buy a motorcycle
if I paid for it myself.

895
00:58:53,730 --> 00:58:56,563
It's her one stipulation, right?

896
00:58:58,167 --> 00:58:59,225
So I work at the mall.

897
00:58:59,302 --> 00:59:01,099
And I have that whole Kerouac thing
planned for this summer,

898
00:59:01,170 --> 00:59:03,161
and now it's, "No."

899
00:59:03,806 --> 00:59:07,264
I'm 18 years old.
I have the right to buy a motorcycle.

900
00:59:08,011 --> 00:59:10,377
But you had a motorcycle once.

901
00:59:10,446 --> 00:59:12,380
And you ended up hating it.

902
00:59:12,448 --> 00:59:13,915
Remember, Trey?

903
00:59:14,350 --> 00:59:17,319
Remember? You used to park it
on the other side of the gym.

904
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:19,287
It was red and black. And...

905
00:59:19,989 --> 00:59:22,549
You got really tired of taking care of it.

906
00:59:22,625 --> 00:59:24,115
What're you talking about?

907
00:59:24,193 --> 00:59:28,323
That was my mom's technique
when I wanted something.

908
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:32,266
She'd say, "But you had
a birthday party last year.

909
00:59:33,269 --> 00:59:35,499
"Remember? We had a big cake

910
00:59:36,339 --> 00:59:39,968
"with pink icing and roses all over it.

911
00:59:40,143 --> 00:59:41,667
"And you hated it."

912
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:45,612
And she was totally messing with you?

913
00:59:45,682 --> 00:59:47,013
- It got her out of giving me a birthday party.
- Wow.

914
00:59:47,116 --> 00:59:51,314
I mean, I have wonderful memories of

915
00:59:51,387 --> 00:59:57,587
balloons and ballerinas and rollercoasters.

916
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:05,291
And it never happened.
That's pretty messed up.

917
01:00:07,236 --> 01:00:12,401
"We certainly can't have a big party
like that every year, can we?"

918
01:00:14,811 --> 01:00:17,780
So, when did you finally figure it out?

919
01:00:18,881 --> 01:00:23,215
Well, by then she had this other trick.

920
01:00:26,923 --> 01:00:31,587
So suggest something to me.
Something you'd like to do.

921
01:00:31,661 --> 01:00:33,356
Okay. Um...

922
01:00:36,833 --> 01:00:38,494
Let's get a room.

923
01:00:39,769 --> 01:00:42,567
Let's not get a room and just say we did.

924
01:00:43,773 --> 01:00:45,365
Then we give up?

925
01:00:50,146 --> 01:00:52,614
You weren't a very persistent kid, were you?

926
01:00:52,682 --> 01:00:55,173
- Trey, you really shouldn't come on to me.
- Why?

927
01:00:55,251 --> 01:00:57,242
Because you're a teacher?

928
01:01:07,563 --> 01:01:09,463
I... We can't do this.

929
01:01:18,841 --> 01:01:20,706
Let's get out of here.

930
01:01:22,345 --> 01:01:24,245
We'll go back to my place. We'll just talk.

931
01:01:24,313 --> 01:01:26,611
Let's not and just wish we did.

932
01:01:29,452 --> 01:01:31,317
I don't wanna pretend.

933
01:01:39,128 --> 01:01:40,652
Um, we're late.

934
01:01:44,167 --> 01:01:46,032
Just give me a second.

935
01:01:48,271 --> 01:01:49,363
God.

936
01:02:23,072 --> 01:02:25,870
- Does this place seem creepy?
- It's quiet.

937
01:02:28,544 --> 01:02:30,842
- Wow, Sylvia, you look great!
- Hottie!

938
01:02:30,913 --> 01:02:33,006
It's the new me.

939
01:02:33,082 --> 01:02:35,448
- Hey, how's Corinne doing?
- Great.

940
01:02:35,518 --> 01:02:38,612
So, are we up for Grigg's amazing insights
on <i>Northanger Abbey?</i>

941
01:02:38,688 --> 01:02:40,121
Stop it. He might surprise you.

942
01:02:40,189 --> 01:02:43,181
- I hope his couch has arrived.
- Oh, I don't mind sitting on the floor.

943
01:02:43,259 --> 01:02:46,490
- Passing around cans of aerosol cheese?
- Stop it. Fine.

944
01:02:46,562 --> 01:02:49,861
Grigg is a grownup.
I'm sure he's made it very nice.

945
01:02:50,433 --> 01:02:51,900
All right.

946
01:02:53,035 --> 01:02:55,503
<i>Welcome. Please come in.</i>

947
01:02:55,571 --> 01:02:59,200
- Whoa.
- Grigg? Whoa!

948
01:02:59,342 --> 01:03:02,038
Apparently, he thinks it's Hallowe'en.

949
01:03:06,215 --> 01:03:10,584
- No, it's <i>Northanger Abbey!</i> It's Gothic!
- Right!

950
01:03:16,025 --> 01:03:18,653
<i>No one gets out alive!</i>

951
01:03:19,796 --> 01:03:22,492
- I don't like this. I don't like this.
- Sylvia, Sylvia!

952
01:03:22,565 --> 01:03:25,363
- Grigg? Grigg? Grigg?
- Sylvia, it's a joke.

953
01:03:27,603 --> 01:03:29,503
- He's just having fun...
- Oh, Sylvia, Sylvia, Sylvia!

954
01:03:29,572 --> 01:03:32,006
It's okay. It's all right.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

955
01:03:32,074 --> 01:03:35,908
- Look.
- It's a send-up of <i>Northanger.</i>

956
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:39,911
- It's a program.
- Bernadette, that's your phone.

957
01:03:39,982 --> 01:03:43,179
This is my remote.
And everything's on sensors.

958
01:03:43,252 --> 01:03:47,120
Prudie? Oh, hi, Dean.
Is Prudie running late?

959
01:03:47,190 --> 01:03:49,658
- What do you do on Hallowe'en?
- Oh, Hallowe'en is big.

960
01:03:49,725 --> 01:03:52,523
Hallowe'en is much, much bigger.
You should come over for Hallowe'en.

961
01:03:52,595 --> 01:03:54,256
- Wait.
- Oh, that's terrible.

962
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:56,628
I got inspired reading
<i>The Mysteries of Udolpho.</i>

963
01:03:56,699 --> 01:04:00,362
You know, the book in <i>Northanger Abbey</i>
that Catherine's obsessed with reading?

964
01:04:00,436 --> 01:04:02,336
- You read <i>The Mysteries of Udolpho?</i>
- Food!

965
01:04:02,405 --> 01:04:05,602
- Hey, Grigg, that color almost works.
- When did you...

966
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:07,836
- He read <i>The Mysteries of Udolpho.</i>
- Wow.

967
01:04:07,910 --> 01:04:10,708
Wait, that book they were reading
in the book? That's a real book?

968
01:04:10,780 --> 01:04:13,374
Yeah, with the black veils
and Laurentina's skeleton.

969
01:04:13,449 --> 01:04:17,317
- Didn't you think that sounded great?
- Yeah, it sounded awesome.

970
01:04:17,386 --> 01:04:20,378
Dean, I'm so sorry.
Prudie must be devastated.

971
01:04:20,590 --> 01:04:21,750
<i>Prudie said to ask you.</i>

972
01:04:21,824 --> 01:04:24,452
She's supposed to talk or something,
about some book?

973
01:04:24,527 --> 01:04:25,892
<i>Persuasion.</i>

974
01:04:26,462 --> 01:04:29,590
We don't know how long we're gonna be
down in San Diego, so...

975
01:04:29,665 --> 01:04:30,825
She may have to cancel.

976
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:32,834
Tell her we'll save <i>Persuasion</i> for the end.

977
01:04:32,902 --> 01:04:36,167
It's better to do it last, anyway.
It was Austen's final book.

978
01:04:36,239 --> 01:04:38,332
I thought <i>Northanger Abbey</i> was
the final book.

979
01:04:38,407 --> 01:04:41,171
- Written first. Published last.
- That makes much more sense.

980
01:04:41,244 --> 01:04:43,109
- Why?
- What happened with her?

981
01:04:43,179 --> 01:04:44,806
'Cause it's a novel about novels.

982
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:49,045
You know? You see Austen as
the young writer, questioning herself.

983
01:04:49,118 --> 01:04:52,212
"Who's a heroine?
What makes a good story?

984
01:04:52,288 --> 01:04:55,485
"Are novels a waste of time? Am I
gonna write? What should I write about?"

985
01:04:55,558 --> 01:04:58,959
- I like that.
- That's actually very perceptive, Grigg.

986
01:04:59,528 --> 01:05:00,722
Thanks.

987
01:05:01,731 --> 01:05:03,062
Prudie's mother died.

988
01:05:03,132 --> 01:05:04,599
- What?
- Jesus.

989
01:05:06,969 --> 01:05:10,063
She got into her car yesterday,
this was in San Diego.

990
01:05:10,940 --> 01:05:15,104
She made a left coming out of a parking lot
into oncoming traffic.

991
01:05:15,177 --> 01:05:16,838
- Jesus.
- Terrible.

992
01:05:16,979 --> 01:05:20,437
- Were Prudie and her mom close?
- Well, there was tension.

993
01:05:25,621 --> 01:05:28,784
What do we think? Is <i>Persuasion</i>
too depressing to take on right now,

994
01:05:28,858 --> 01:05:30,587
with the dead mother and everything?

995
01:05:30,660 --> 01:05:32,594
She doesn't die on the page.

996
01:05:32,662 --> 01:05:35,460
Even <i>Sense and Sensibility,</i> the dad dies.

997
01:05:35,731 --> 01:05:37,096
What about <i>Pride and Prejudice?</i>

998
01:05:37,166 --> 01:05:41,762
I could use a little encounter in the woods
with Mr. Darcy right now.

999
01:05:41,871 --> 01:05:44,362
- Are we all up for a little romance?
- Ready.

1000
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:48,103
I think we're all overdue.
And it'll be better for Prudie.

1001
01:05:49,512 --> 01:05:53,175
I still can't believe you read
<i>The Mysteries of Udolpho,</i> Grigg.

1002
01:05:53,249 --> 01:05:56,912
- Bravo, Grigg. Bravo.
- Yay for the grilled artichokes.

1003
01:05:56,986 --> 01:06:01,286
- You can move in with us any time, Grigg.
- Please, don't bring skeletons.

1004
01:06:02,425 --> 01:06:04,052
She loves these.

1005
01:06:05,494 --> 01:06:08,019
Are you and Grigg seeing each other?

1006
01:06:08,097 --> 01:06:12,625
No. He's interested in Sylvia, obviously.
That was the plan, right?

1007
01:06:42,264 --> 01:06:43,288
I don't wanna fight, okay?

1008
01:06:43,366 --> 01:06:45,630
I don't know why you didn't
just take her back to the car

1009
01:06:45,701 --> 01:06:49,068
and have sex with her.
I mean, clearly you wanted to.

1010
01:06:50,072 --> 01:06:52,836
I talked to her...
I talked to her for like five minutes.

1011
01:06:52,908 --> 01:06:54,671
Longer. Longer, Dean.

1012
01:06:54,744 --> 01:06:58,737
And with those ridiculous plastic boobs.
Is that what you go for?

1013
01:07:01,250 --> 01:07:03,878
Prudie, you know,
I was just trying to be nice to your friend.

1014
01:07:03,953 --> 01:07:07,047
Okay. Chloe Baher is not my friend, Dean.

1015
01:07:07,123 --> 01:07:12,060
Chloe Baher came to my mother's funeral
to gloat. "Ha-ha! Your mother's dead."

1016
01:07:12,128 --> 01:07:13,527
And you hit on her!

1017
01:07:13,596 --> 01:07:15,496
- I do... I do...
- You hit on her!

1018
01:07:15,564 --> 01:07:17,759
I was not hitting on her.

1019
01:07:33,149 --> 01:07:35,743
You know, when I was in the 10th grade,

1020
01:07:35,818 --> 01:07:40,414
I wrote an entire paper on <i>Julius Caesar</i>
in iambic pentameter.

1021
01:07:40,489 --> 01:07:46,894
And Chloe Baher removed it from my locker
and she read it aloud to the whole class.

1022
01:07:47,696 --> 01:07:50,290
And everyone laughed at me.

1023
01:07:52,468 --> 01:07:54,459
Baby, high school's over.

1024
01:07:55,638 --> 01:07:57,629
High school's never over.

1025
01:08:07,883 --> 01:08:10,784
<i>"And turning 'round,</i>
<i>he looked for a moment at Elizabeth</i>

1026
01:08:10,853 --> 01:08:14,516
<i>"till catching her eye,</i>
<i>he withdrew his own and coldly said,</i>

1027
01:08:14,590 --> 01:08:18,356

consequence to young ladies

01:08:22,031 --> 01:08:23,862
"'who are slighted by other men.

1030
01:08:23,933 --> 01:08:26,902
<i>"'You had better return to your partner</i>
<i>and enjoy her smiles,</i>

1031
01:08:26,969 --> 01:08:29,665
<i>"'for you are wasting your time with me."'</i>

1032
01:08:33,242 --> 01:08:35,301
You know, I don't know if we can
do <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> next week,

1033
01:08:35,377 --> 01:08:36,810
because it's the library dinner.

1034
01:08:36,879 --> 01:08:39,643
Well, we need to go for Sylvia.
Daniel's bringing Pam.

1035
01:08:39,715 --> 01:08:42,240
- That's so unnecessary.
- Tell me about it.

1036
01:08:42,318 --> 01:08:44,878
- His firm's buying a table.
- Well, then we should buy one.

1037
01:08:44,954 --> 01:08:46,546
All of us, the book club.

1038
01:08:46,622 --> 01:08:48,419
- Show up in force.
- Yes.

1039
01:08:48,491 --> 01:08:53,554
"The Central Valley River City
All Jane Austen, All The Time Book Club,"

1040
01:08:53,629 --> 01:08:54,994
is what Grigg calls it.

1041
01:08:55,064 --> 01:08:57,464
He's so funny. I'm so glad
he finally made a date with Sylvia.

1042
01:08:57,533 --> 01:08:59,091
He's taking her to lunch.

1043
01:08:59,168 --> 01:09:02,160
I sure hope there's some dancing
in this thing.

1044
01:09:02,238 --> 01:09:03,967
I'm trying to diet.

1045
01:09:05,107 --> 01:09:08,167
My husband is bringing a date
to my fundraiser.

1046
01:09:09,278 --> 01:09:11,178
Yeah, re-reading <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> again,

1047
01:09:11,247 --> 01:09:13,238
I keep thinking,
"You know, courtship is easy."

1048
01:09:13,315 --> 01:09:16,443
- Where's Austen's novel on divorce?
- I wouldn't say it was easy.

1049
01:09:16,519 --> 01:09:19,113
Depends who you're courting, I guess.

1050
01:09:19,688 --> 01:09:25,092
- Does Jocelyn ever go out with anyone?
- Occasionally.

1051
01:09:25,928 --> 01:09:27,759
She used to date my husband
in high school.

1052
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:30,799
Then she sort of gave him to me.

1053
01:09:31,333 --> 01:09:34,496
Daniel's the one
that first bought Jocelyn a dog.

1054
01:09:34,904 --> 01:09:40,035
- She traded your husband for a dog?
- Look, I adore Jocelyn, but...

1055
01:09:40,643 --> 01:09:43,009
If loving is letting go,

1056
01:09:43,078 --> 01:09:48,516
then whoever wants Jocelyn is going to
have to pry her fingers loose, one by one.

1057
01:10:01,997 --> 01:10:04,522
- Hey.
- Hi.

1058
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:05,624
Hey.

1059
01:10:05,701 --> 01:10:06,963
Do you know Lynne from my writing group?

1060
01:10:07,036 --> 01:10:09,095
- I don't, actually. Allegra.
- Hey.

1061
01:10:09,171 --> 01:10:12,038
Listen, I just have to say,
you have been so good for Corinne.

1062
01:10:12,107 --> 01:10:14,803
Ever since you two have been together,
she's been writing nonstop.

1063
01:10:14,877 --> 01:10:17,209
Didn't you just love that story
that she wrote last week?

1064
01:10:17,279 --> 01:10:21,181
Well, Allegra and I don't discuss
what I'm working on.

1065
01:10:23,085 --> 01:10:24,177
Okay.

1066
01:10:31,660 --> 01:10:33,685
<i>"Dear Ms. Corinne Mahern, we regret</i>

1067
01:10:35,231 --> 01:10:38,598
<i>"that we must decline to publish</i>
<i>the three short stories you sent us.</i>

1068
01:10:38,667 --> 01:10:41,636
<i>"Benny's Basketball" is strong narratively,</i>

1069
01:10:41,704 --> 01:10:47,108
<i>"but the depiction of your penis-waving</i>
<i>retarded boy felt a little unkind.</i>

1070
01:10:47,743 --> 01:10:52,077
<i>"And isn't the title</i>
<i>"Separating Eggs For Flan" a bit obvious</i>

1071
01:10:52,147 --> 01:10:54,308
<i>"as a metaphor for your parents' divorce?</i>

1072
01:10:54,383 --> 01:10:57,477
<i>"Yet we confess that "Skydiver"</i>
<i>puzzled us most.</i>

1073
01:10:58,254 --> 01:11:02,588
<i>"Why would a beautiful, self-centered</i>
<i>young lesbian jump out of a plane?"</i>

1074
01:11:11,934 --> 01:11:14,368
I thought we could drive together.

1075
01:11:14,503 --> 01:11:17,165
We should hurry.
I don't want Sylvia sitting there alone.

1076
01:11:17,239 --> 01:11:19,230
- Sahara, off.
- Sylvia's already at the library.

1077
01:11:19,308 --> 01:11:22,641
- She said she had to get there early.
- So you offered her a ride first.

1078
01:11:22,711 --> 01:11:25,441
No, she happened to mention it at lunch.

1079
01:11:27,016 --> 01:11:28,813
That's a great dress.

1080
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:32,646
Stay.

1081
01:11:32,955 --> 01:11:37,289
I converted it to biodiesel.
So it basically runs on donut grease.

1082
01:11:40,529 --> 01:11:43,362
This is so great. I never get to drive it.

1083
01:11:45,367 --> 01:11:47,358
Or vacuum it, apparently.

1084
01:11:52,074 --> 01:11:53,701
I like your hair.

1085
01:11:55,411 --> 01:11:58,073
You need to dance with Sylvia tonight.

1086
01:11:59,281 --> 01:12:02,045
- You do know how to dance, don't you?
- Of course I do.

1087
01:12:02,117 --> 01:12:04,881
I have three older sisters. I can dance.

1088
01:12:05,087 --> 01:12:07,612
Wait, if we stay in this lane,
we're gonna be late.

1089
01:12:07,723 --> 01:12:10,283
Given that I have to convert
donut grease into biofuel

1090
01:12:10,359 --> 01:12:13,817
every time I fill up the tank,
I just try not to drive very fast.

1091
01:12:13,896 --> 01:12:15,659
We're barely moving.

1092
01:12:17,700 --> 01:12:20,760
You ever read those Le Guin books
I bought you?

1093
01:12:20,869 --> 01:12:23,269
I prefer books about real people.

1094
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:29,800
Okay, so Elizabeth Bennet is real
and people in science fiction aren't.

1095
01:12:29,878 --> 01:12:31,004
Is that it?

1096
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:34,174
Science fiction books have people in them,
but they're not about the people.

1097
01:12:34,249 --> 01:12:35,614
Real people are complicated.

1098
01:12:35,684 --> 01:12:37,311
Well, there's all kinds of science fiction.

1099
01:12:37,386 --> 01:12:41,117
When you've read some,
I will be interested in your opinion.

1100
01:12:41,790 --> 01:12:45,351
- Why are you getting off here?
- I enjoy seeing the river.

1101
01:12:45,694 --> 01:12:46,956
What are you, Mark Twain?

1102
01:12:47,029 --> 01:12:49,827
Now we're gonna get stuck at every light.

1103
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:00,172
Look at the talent in this room.

1104
01:13:00,676 --> 01:13:03,008
Half the Silicon Valley is here.

1105
01:13:05,114 --> 01:13:06,411
To romance.

1106
01:13:06,482 --> 01:13:07,847
- Hi.
- Hello.

1107
01:13:10,152 --> 01:13:12,814
I'm planning on meeting a software baron
and moving to Pemberley.

1108
01:13:12,888 --> 01:13:16,324
Well, everyone knows a rich man
is eventually going to want a new wife.

1109
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:20,118
- Hi.
- Hi.

1110
01:13:21,263 --> 01:13:22,355
I'm Dean.

1111
01:13:22,431 --> 01:13:24,160
Yeah, he's not doing book club with us.

1112
01:13:24,233 --> 01:13:26,463
Uh, moral support.
She's had a rough couple of weeks.

1113
01:13:26,535 --> 01:13:30,631
- Well, you're welcome to join in, Dean.
- Nah, that's okay.

1114
01:13:30,706 --> 01:13:34,164
I think I'll just head to the bar.
Let you ladies talk.

1115
01:13:34,243 --> 01:13:37,110
There is no bar. It's a library.

1116
01:13:37,179 --> 01:13:39,647
- Serving liquor.
- Well, that'll work.

1117
01:13:39,715 --> 01:13:41,615
You guys need anything?

1118
01:13:43,152 --> 01:13:46,053
We had this big fight on the way over here.

1119
01:13:46,855 --> 01:13:48,846
- Have some champagne.
- Mom?

1120
01:13:51,226 --> 01:13:53,217
I broke up with Corinne.

1121
01:13:54,163 --> 01:13:55,790
Oh, my God. Honey.

1122
01:13:57,933 --> 01:14:02,370
- Nice.
- We have plenty of time.

1123
01:14:20,489 --> 01:14:23,515
Honey, whatever happened between
you and Corinne, you don't just walk out.

1124
01:14:23,592 --> 01:14:26,891
- You don't even know what she did.
- Did she hit you?

1125
01:14:28,030 --> 01:14:30,021
Did she say cruel things?

1126
01:14:30,966 --> 01:14:34,265
You are so quick to love. You're too quick.

1127
01:14:34,837 --> 01:14:38,739
You jump in, you jump out.
That's Daniel in you. Quick to act.

1128
01:14:38,807 --> 01:14:42,174
"It's not working? Well...
Fix it. Or break it. Who cares?"

1129
01:14:42,244 --> 01:14:47,307
We don't just dispose of people we love.
You stay. You repair.

1130
01:14:47,382 --> 01:14:50,010
Okay, you know what?
This is not you and Daddy.

1131
01:14:50,085 --> 01:14:53,020
This is Corinne. The difference being
that Daddy actually loves you.

1132
01:14:53,088 --> 01:14:55,283
So you go repair. Power on.

1133
01:14:55,357 --> 01:14:57,985
Maybe Daddy'll give up
this woman he's been fucking.

1134
01:14:58,093 --> 01:15:01,085
- Allegra.
- But Corinne, I'm dumping the bitch.

1135
01:15:05,234 --> 01:15:08,533
- We're gonna be so late.
- I'll call a cab.

1136
01:15:08,604 --> 01:15:12,040
I will not let Sylvia be alone when Daniel
walks into that library with Pam.

1137
01:15:12,107 --> 01:15:13,836
You got your phone?

1138
01:15:18,013 --> 01:15:20,004
I'll find a payphone.

1139
01:15:20,082 --> 01:15:22,209
Are you attracted to Sylvia?

1140
01:15:23,785 --> 01:15:26,845
Yeah, she's, um... She's nice.

1141
01:15:27,222 --> 01:15:30,123
She's more than nice.
She's smart and funny...

1142
01:15:30,192 --> 01:15:34,356
- And she's in love with her husband.
- Well, she needs to get over that.

1143
01:15:36,698 --> 01:15:39,667
Why don't you stop interfering?
Let Sylvia work out her own life.

1144
01:15:39,735 --> 01:15:41,327
It's interfering
to want my best friend to be happy.

1145
01:15:41,403 --> 01:15:44,304
If that's interfering, I hope I never stop.

1146
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:46,972
What about me? Am I your friend?

1147
01:15:47,142 --> 01:15:51,772
Or am I just some widget to help you
make Sylvia feel better about herself?

1148
01:15:52,447 --> 01:15:54,438
Why did you invite me
to be part of your book club?

1149
01:15:54,516 --> 01:15:56,643
What went through your mind
the first time you saw me?

1150
01:15:56,718 --> 01:16:00,313
"There's a man who is dying to read
every book Jane Austen ever wrote."

1151
01:16:00,389 --> 01:16:02,016
- Is that what you thought?
- No.

1152
01:16:02,090 --> 01:16:06,049
But I thought, "What a beautiful woman.
I hope she looks over at me."

1153
01:16:06,795 --> 01:16:09,195
I thought if I read your favorite books
that you would read mine.

1154
01:16:09,264 --> 01:16:11,994
But, no, no, no. You just wanna be obeyed.

1155
01:16:14,636 --> 01:16:16,627
That's why you have dogs.

1156
01:16:19,341 --> 01:16:22,310
For such a famously romantic story,

1157
01:16:22,377 --> 01:16:26,040
<i>Pride and Prejudice</i> is a parade
of bizarre marriages.

1158
01:16:26,114 --> 01:16:28,480
I've had every marriage in this book.

1159
01:16:29,518 --> 01:16:32,885
My first husband was a politician.
He was embarrassed by every move I made.

1160
01:16:32,955 --> 01:16:35,446
He said I was rude and loud.

1161
01:16:35,524 --> 01:16:39,051
"Stop pointing your breasts everywhere,"
he'd say to me.

1162
01:16:40,462 --> 01:16:43,090
I was 17. I was Charlotte Lucas.

1163
01:16:43,165 --> 01:16:45,861
I married the first man who looked at me.

1164
01:16:45,934 --> 01:16:48,528
<i>Tout le monde est sage apres le coup.</i>

1165
01:16:50,739 --> 01:16:54,038
You don't see your own marriage
until it's too late.

1166
01:16:54,977 --> 01:17:00,313
So, um... I actually thought
that Charlotte Lucas was gay.

1167
01:17:01,149 --> 01:17:05,745
Really, I think that when she tells Lizzie
she's not as romantic as she is,

1168
01:17:05,821 --> 01:17:07,049
I think that's what she means.

1169
01:17:07,122 --> 01:17:11,183
Charlotte Lucas is not gay. She's not.
She just... She just has no options.

1170
01:17:11,259 --> 01:17:13,784
Wait. Austen meant Charlotte to be gay

1171
01:17:13,862 --> 01:17:16,296
or Charlotte is gay
and Austen is not aware of it?

1172
01:17:16,365 --> 01:17:20,392
I just love the idea
of a character having a secret life

1173
01:17:20,469 --> 01:17:21,936
that the author doesn't even know about.

1174
01:17:22,004 --> 01:17:24,939
You know, frankly,
I kind of admire Charlotte

1175
01:17:25,007 --> 01:17:27,908
for looking at her situation
and deciding to marry Mr. Collins.

1176
01:17:27,976 --> 01:17:31,468
I mean, yes, yes, she knows
he'll never be the "love of her life,"

1177
01:17:31,546 --> 01:17:33,036
but that's okay.

1178
01:17:33,115 --> 01:17:35,345
That is exactly the reason
that Jocelyn would hate her.

1179
01:17:35,417 --> 01:17:36,816
Jocelyn has contempt for anyone

1180
01:17:36,885 --> 01:17:38,853
who settles for anything less
than the perfect love.

1181
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:42,117
You know, it's probably why Jocelyn
has never married.

1182
01:17:42,190 --> 01:17:44,158
My apologies, everybody.

1183
01:17:46,094 --> 01:17:47,891
- Hello.
- Hi.

1184
01:17:50,832 --> 01:17:52,925
We ran out of donut grease.

1185
01:17:55,871 --> 01:17:57,702
- Grigg Harris.
- Dean Drummond.

1186
01:17:57,806 --> 01:18:00,206
- Wait, Grigg... Grigg from the book club?
- Yeah.

1187
01:18:01,410 --> 01:18:05,403
No, it's just Prudie would say "Grigg,"
and I just didn't picture it as a guy.

1188
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:07,812
So you thought Grigg was a girl?

1189
01:18:09,651 --> 01:18:13,314
Dean thinks "Austen"
is the capital of Texas.

1190
01:18:15,524 --> 01:18:16,616
Wow.

1191
01:18:18,493 --> 01:18:20,791
You'll notice that Jane,

1192
01:18:21,329 --> 01:18:24,423
she never shows what happens
after the wedding.

1193
01:18:25,167 --> 01:18:28,398
Maybe Elizabeth and Darcy
start hating each other.

1194
01:18:29,271 --> 01:18:31,205
Maybe Lizzie went off to Pemberley,

1195
01:18:31,273 --> 01:18:34,606
and she turned into this crazy person,
like her mom,

1196
01:18:34,676 --> 01:18:37,110
because our mothers are like time bombs.

1197
01:18:37,179 --> 01:18:40,376
They just... They tick away inside of us.

1198
01:18:40,449 --> 01:18:44,146
Let's not give Mrs. Bennet
more importance than she deserves.

1199
01:18:46,321 --> 01:18:49,779
- You know, I mean, what about the father?
- What father?

1200
01:18:50,492 --> 01:18:54,690
You know, my mom showed me
a picture of a guy in uniform.

1201
01:18:55,497 --> 01:18:57,522
Well, maybe she made him up.

1202
01:18:58,100 --> 01:19:01,035
Or maybe she bought it at a garage sale.

1203
01:19:01,603 --> 01:19:04,902
And I kept it in my room, this...

1204
01:19:08,477 --> 01:19:10,672
I kept it in my room.

1205
01:19:12,948 --> 01:19:14,848
Let's not do this now, okay?

1206
01:19:28,430 --> 01:19:29,954
Dean, I got it.

1207
01:20:10,405 --> 01:20:11,736
Bernadette.

1208
01:20:11,940 --> 01:20:13,601
Daniel never came.

1209
01:20:15,243 --> 01:20:16,369
Good.

1210
01:20:34,996 --> 01:20:37,556
I'm in love with one of my students.

1211
01:20:41,369 --> 01:20:45,237
But I mean, nothing's happened. Much.

1212
01:20:46,241 --> 01:20:47,708
But it could.

1213
01:20:49,177 --> 01:20:51,042
It could, if I let it.

1214
01:20:53,648 --> 01:20:56,640
I fantasize about him constantly.

1215
01:20:57,152 --> 01:21:00,383
Sweetie, your mother died. This is grief.

1216
01:21:01,957 --> 01:21:08,863
He looks at me like he's the spoon,
and I'm the dish of ice cream.

1217
01:21:13,268 --> 01:21:16,738
It's a good thing we're reading
<i>Sense and Sensibility</i> next.

1218
01:21:33,188 --> 01:21:36,589
- I love you so.
- But how can you be sure in just one day?

1219
01:21:36,658 --> 01:21:41,857
I do not know. 'Tis just when a lass falls in
or out of love, she knows it right away.

1220
01:21:43,498 --> 01:21:47,662
- You think you're in love with me?
- Think?

1221
01:21:47,736 --> 01:21:51,866
What good does thinking do
but what I feel is something else?

1222
01:22:21,036 --> 01:22:22,469
- Hey, you got your cast off.
- Yeah.

1223
01:22:22,537 --> 01:22:24,164
- How does it feel?
- Great.

1224
01:22:24,239 --> 01:22:28,141
You can reach it.
Just really stretch your arm out.

1225
01:22:29,311 --> 01:22:32,769
There you go.
Just give the rope a little bit of a shake.

1226
01:22:34,015 --> 01:22:36,040
You can do it, there... Can you put your...

1227
01:22:36,117 --> 01:22:39,109
Can you put your right foot
in that blue thing?

1228
01:22:39,187 --> 01:22:40,779
It's gonna be fine.

1229
01:22:40,855 --> 01:22:43,585
- Here, hang on.
- You can reach it.

1230
01:22:43,658 --> 01:22:45,319
- Just reach up.
- It's caught.

1231
01:22:45,393 --> 01:22:47,759
It's okay. You're doing good.

1232
01:22:58,740 --> 01:23:02,699
I'm totally okay. I'm not even hurt.
It's nothing.

1233
01:23:02,777 --> 01:23:04,677
I'm sorry, I have to stop you here.

1234
01:23:04,746 --> 01:23:07,146
It's not likely to be anything
more than a concussion.

1235
01:23:07,215 --> 01:23:10,616
I'd like to keep Allegra under observation
for a few days, okay?

1236
01:23:10,685 --> 01:23:13,483
And if you need to reach me, I'm Dr. Yep.

1237
01:23:17,892 --> 01:23:21,055
How many times have we had to come here
to get her stitched up?

1238
01:23:21,262 --> 01:23:23,196
- It's always Allegra, never the boys.
- Well, she's the one

1239
01:23:23,264 --> 01:23:27,667
who goes mountain climbing
and skateboarding and snowboarding.

1240
01:23:27,736 --> 01:23:30,671
It's a miracle she never tried parachuting.

1241
01:23:32,307 --> 01:23:33,968
She's so extreme.

1242
01:23:36,711 --> 01:23:39,339
One minute she's crazy in love
with Corinne,

1243
01:23:39,414 --> 01:23:42,474
the next minute she's never
hated anybody more.

1244
01:23:46,488 --> 01:23:48,922
- She's gonna be okay, right?
- She's fine.

1245
01:23:48,990 --> 01:23:51,891
She just took a knock on the noodle.

1246
01:23:54,562 --> 01:23:57,793
This is gonna sound, probably, horrible,
considering the fact that

1247
01:23:57,866 --> 01:24:01,825
she's got this lump on her head, but...
It's just...

1248
01:24:02,337 --> 01:24:05,306
It's great to have us all
in the same room again.

1249
01:24:06,474 --> 01:24:10,467
Just feels so normal.

1250
01:24:14,249 --> 01:24:15,716
Normal, yeah.

1251
01:24:25,126 --> 01:24:28,960
You know, I haven't been seeing Pam
for a couple of months now.

1252
01:24:29,964 --> 01:24:32,455
So, that must be a big change.

1253
01:24:34,335 --> 01:24:36,235
You know, I was thinking just this morning

1254
01:24:36,304 --> 01:24:39,671
about this book club that we're in,
Allegra and me.

1255
01:24:40,575 --> 01:24:42,634
The first meeting was...

1256
01:24:43,945 --> 01:24:48,041
Yeah, we had just been separated.
'Cause Allegra had just moved in.

1257
01:24:48,650 --> 01:24:53,485
And I was realizing how different I feel.

1258
01:24:55,824 --> 01:24:57,758
I don't think I'm the same woman
that you left.

1259
01:24:57,826 --> 01:25:00,454
I can see that. I so see that.

1260
01:25:00,528 --> 01:25:03,122
Well, it's probably the same for you.

1261
01:25:03,398 --> 01:25:06,458
I guess that's what happens
when you let go.

1262
01:25:09,304 --> 01:25:13,001
We did a good job taking things apart.

1263
01:25:15,376 --> 01:25:17,241
I'm kind of proud of us.

1264
01:25:20,014 --> 01:25:23,211
I'm warning you, if Grigg starts
making little remarks, I'm gonna walk out.

1265
01:25:23,284 --> 01:25:26,185
You two just keep it together
for one more book.

1266
01:25:26,254 --> 01:25:28,950
I wish he'd just drop out of the group.

1267
01:25:31,793 --> 01:25:35,729
Austen sets up this juicy triangle
between Elinor, Edward and Lucy Steele.

1268
01:25:35,797 --> 01:25:39,164
And then at the end, she practically
has to whip a rabbit out of a hat

1269
01:25:39,234 --> 01:25:41,600
to make Lucy Steele run off
with Edward's brother?

1270
01:25:41,669 --> 01:25:44,467
- Yeah, that requires some hand-waving.
- I think the ending's well-plotted.

1271
01:25:44,539 --> 01:25:49,636
To me, the part that seems forced is
Marianne ending up with Colonel Brandon.

1272
01:25:49,711 --> 01:25:52,305
- Anyone else feel that?
- Oh, I have no problem with that.

1273
01:25:52,380 --> 01:25:58,376
He rides up on a big stallion,
sweeps her into his arms. I'm there.

1274
01:25:59,087 --> 01:26:01,419
From the time Colonel Brandon
meets Marianne,

1275
01:26:01,489 --> 01:26:03,218
he just lavishes all this attention on her.

1276
01:26:03,291 --> 01:26:05,657
And meanwhile,
she's throwing herself at Willoughby.

1277
01:26:05,727 --> 01:26:07,217
Willoughby is a player.

1278
01:26:07,295 --> 01:26:08,660
Women never go for the nice guy.

1279
01:26:08,763 --> 01:26:11,823
Please. Men say that, but you get to know
some of these men who complain the most,

1280
01:26:11,900 --> 01:26:15,859
you find out they're not as nice
as they like to think they are.

1281
01:26:15,937 --> 01:26:17,666
Okay. You know what struck me?

1282
01:26:17,739 --> 01:26:21,675
Is that Colonel Brandon is only
a few years younger than Mrs. Dashwood.

1283
01:26:21,743 --> 01:26:23,836
Well, why does he take up with
the daughter and not the mother?

1284
01:26:23,912 --> 01:26:25,607
Yeah, why not Mrs. Dashwood?

1285
01:26:25,680 --> 01:26:28,547
Maybe Mrs. Dashwood
won't give him the time of day.

1286
01:26:28,616 --> 01:26:31,676
- The book is about the young people.
- Yeah, because Jane Austen thinks

1287
01:26:31,753 --> 01:26:34,313
that nothing interesting can happen
to a woman over 25.

1288
01:26:34,389 --> 01:26:39,884
When actually, a novel about a woman
seducing a slightly younger man

1289
01:26:40,361 --> 01:26:42,352
just yields so much more.

1290
01:26:43,164 --> 01:26:46,133
Well, then maybe Mrs. Dashwood
should go for Willoughby.

1291
01:26:46,201 --> 01:26:47,498
Why not?

1292
01:26:48,703 --> 01:26:50,330
It's a long, hot summer.

1293
01:26:50,405 --> 01:26:52,464
Maybe Mrs. Dashwood
has more sense than that.

1294
01:26:52,540 --> 01:26:55,407
Okay, can I just point out,
she's hardly in the story.

1295
01:26:55,476 --> 01:26:57,205
Sex is messy.

1296
01:26:57,278 --> 01:27:00,145
Maybe Mrs. Dashwood
prefers a more well-ordered life.

1297
01:27:00,215 --> 01:27:03,707
Maybe that's why
she's such a minor character.

1298
01:27:03,785 --> 01:27:06,185
- I think if you read Austen's novels...
- Oh, I have.

1299
01:27:06,254 --> 01:27:07,380
You wanted me to, and I did.

1300
01:27:07,455 --> 01:27:11,915
I think you'll see she always writes
in favor of order and self-control.

1301
01:27:11,993 --> 01:27:14,257
- Nothing unwise.
- Nothing in haste.

1302
01:27:14,329 --> 01:27:17,298
Okay, so, this is...
This is what, this is a rulebook?

1303
01:27:17,365 --> 01:27:18,457
We could do worse.

1304
01:27:18,533 --> 01:27:21,502
I think Jane Austen wrote about women
falling in love because she was Ionely.

1305
01:27:21,569 --> 01:27:23,764
Oh, you couldn't be more wrong.

1306
01:27:23,838 --> 01:27:27,069
Austen lived a very full life.
She could've gotten married anytime.

1307
01:27:27,141 --> 01:27:28,768
- She almost did.
- That's right.

1308
01:27:28,843 --> 01:27:32,802
- But she decided not to.
- Why, too messy? Too out of control?

1309
01:27:36,451 --> 01:27:40,649
His name was Harris Bigg-Wither,
and they were engaged for one night.

1310
01:27:40,722 --> 01:27:44,556
"Oh, Harris Bigg-Wither!"
I can't believe you know that.

1311
01:27:45,493 --> 01:27:48,929
I understand why Colonel Brandon
goes for Marianne.

1312
01:27:48,997 --> 01:27:50,726
And it's not 'cause she's young.

1313
01:27:50,798 --> 01:27:55,565
It's because she's generous with herself.

1314
01:27:57,272 --> 01:28:01,641
She's willing to risk her heart.
No rules, no fear.

1315
01:28:03,578 --> 01:28:07,446
- And Willoughby tramples her.
- She just picked the wrong guy.

1316
01:28:08,916 --> 01:28:10,577
No rules, no fear.

1317
01:28:12,787 --> 01:28:14,186
I like that.

1318
01:28:43,318 --> 01:28:46,253
- Hi.
- You're wearing that to your book club?

1319
01:28:46,321 --> 01:28:50,621
It's Bernadette's idea to do this beach day,

1320
01:28:50,692 --> 01:28:53,252
'cause in the novel they all go to Lyme,

1321
01:28:53,328 --> 01:28:56,957
which is, you know,
like, the beach in England.

1322
01:28:57,065 --> 01:28:58,930
This is your last one, right?

1323
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:02,492
I think we're gonna do some more books
after this one.

1324
01:29:27,962 --> 01:29:32,194
Prudie's gonna be hours late
and Grigg called. He's bringing a woman.

1325
01:29:33,735 --> 01:29:35,225
Thank God it's the last meeting.

1326
01:29:35,303 --> 01:29:38,101
Yes, there's getting to be
a little too much plot.

1327
01:29:38,172 --> 01:29:39,332
Not that I blame Grigg.

1328
01:29:39,407 --> 01:29:44,435
Something about reading Austen
sort of makes you wanna get it on.

1329
01:29:44,512 --> 01:29:45,536
Hi.

1330
01:29:47,615 --> 01:29:50,982
Started reading it with Allegra
at the hospital. This is a great book.

1331
01:29:51,119 --> 01:29:53,417
Are you joining our discussion?

1332
01:29:54,455 --> 01:29:57,015
- Am I? 'Cause I'd like to.
- Hi.

1333
01:29:57,759 --> 01:30:00,489
- Daniel wants to join us.
- Well he's not in the club, is he?

1334
01:30:00,561 --> 01:30:03,655
Oh, come on, this is my favorite Austen.
So far.

1335
01:30:05,867 --> 01:30:08,768
It's all about mistakes and second chances.

1336
01:30:11,105 --> 01:30:12,834
Yeah, you can stay.

1337
01:30:15,109 --> 01:30:16,133
Glass of wine?

1338
01:31:28,816 --> 01:31:32,252
I can't believe he brought a date
to our last meeting.

1339
01:31:33,554 --> 01:31:38,958
- I kinda had him in mind for you, as a fling.
- For me?

1340
01:31:39,894 --> 01:31:42,192
Honey, I took your boyfriend away from you
in high school.

1341
01:31:42,263 --> 01:31:44,561
Look how that turned out.

1342
01:31:45,967 --> 01:31:47,366
- Hi.
- Hey.

1343
01:31:47,435 --> 01:31:49,528
- How ya doing?
- Guys, this is Cat.

1344
01:31:49,604 --> 01:31:52,664
- Hello.
- I'm Grigg's big sister.

1345
01:31:52,740 --> 01:31:58,235
Oh, God, that's wonderful. That's so...
I'm... God, that's wonderful.

1346
01:31:58,312 --> 01:32:00,371
You're Grigg's sister.
I'm Jocelyn. This is Sylvia.

1347
01:32:00,448 --> 01:32:01,574
- How are you?
- Hi.

1348
01:32:01,649 --> 01:32:03,640
- Good, thank you.
- Hi. Bernadette.

1349
01:32:05,686 --> 01:32:08,814
- I don't believe it.
- Look at you!

1350
01:32:08,890 --> 01:32:10,755
- You look great.
- Good to see you.

1351
01:32:10,825 --> 01:32:12,452
Thank you.

1352
01:32:12,527 --> 01:32:14,995
- Wow, are you visiting from Idaho?
- Yeah, yeah.

1353
01:32:15,062 --> 01:32:19,089
We kept seeing these emails.
And we said, "What kind of strange power

1354
01:32:19,166 --> 01:32:23,000
"do these women have
that they got Grigg to read Jane Austen?"

1355
01:32:23,571 --> 01:32:27,598
Just thought I'd check it out.
You wanna take a walk?

1356
01:32:28,609 --> 01:32:29,974
Well, sure.

1357
01:32:32,280 --> 01:32:33,611
Excuse me.

1358
01:32:40,521 --> 01:32:43,354
Bernie! Mom! Hey. Hey!

1359
01:32:44,025 --> 01:32:47,324
- Hi.
- Dr. Yep?

1360
01:32:47,395 --> 01:32:49,829
Samantha. Thank you for inviting me.

1361
01:32:49,897 --> 01:32:54,561
- I'm sorry we're late.
- Oh. Yeah. Well, Prudie's not even here yet.

1362
01:32:54,635 --> 01:32:56,034
Is that Dad?

1363
01:32:59,040 --> 01:33:00,803
- Let's say hi.
- Okay.

1364
01:33:02,843 --> 01:33:04,105
A doctor.

1365
01:33:06,581 --> 01:33:08,242
Nothing in haste.

1366
01:33:08,449 --> 01:33:11,145
- Dad! Hi!
- Hey.

1367
01:33:19,594 --> 01:33:21,562
Would you do me a favor?

1368
01:33:22,863 --> 01:33:24,626
Would you read this?

1369
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:27,500
Please. Right now.

1370
01:33:28,803 --> 01:33:32,102
Isn't that what your
special little book club's for?

1371
01:33:34,275 --> 01:33:36,470
I really want you to read it.

1372
01:33:38,145 --> 01:33:39,635
Please, Dean.

1373
01:33:45,086 --> 01:33:47,213
It doesn't... They don't...

1374
01:33:47,755 --> 01:33:50,883
Prudie, I feel like you want me
to be something that I'm not.

1375
01:33:50,958 --> 01:33:54,689
I just walk around being me.
I don't pretend to be anything else.

1376
01:33:54,762 --> 01:33:56,593
I'm the guy who thinks "Austen"
is a city in Texas.

1377
01:33:56,664 --> 01:33:59,224
I shouldn't have said that. That was mean.

1378
01:33:59,300 --> 01:34:01,359
You just set me up for a test
that you don't want me to pass.

1379
01:34:01,435 --> 01:34:05,201
No, no. This is not a test.

1380
01:34:05,272 --> 01:34:06,967
This is something to share.

1381
01:34:07,041 --> 01:34:09,942
Why don't you just tell me what it's about?

1382
01:34:11,545 --> 01:34:17,711
It's about these two people
who used to love each other.

1383
01:34:18,653 --> 01:34:20,553
And they don't anymore.

1384
01:34:21,656 --> 01:34:25,456
And it's how they persuade themselves
to give it another try.

1385
01:34:26,694 --> 01:34:30,630
Look, I can get you started off. Okay?

1386
01:34:30,698 --> 01:34:32,131
- "Sir Walter Eliot...
- Prudie.

1387
01:34:32,199 --> 01:34:34,997
"...of Kellynch Hall in Somersetshire
was a man who...

1388
01:34:35,069 --> 01:34:37,663
"for his own amusement, never took up
any book but the..."

1389
01:34:37,738 --> 01:34:41,469
Come on, you're really not gonna
read all of this out loud.

1390
01:34:47,848 --> 01:34:49,440
One page.

1391
01:34:50,951 --> 01:34:54,887
"There he found occupation
for an idle hour

1392
01:34:54,989 --> 01:34:57,150
"and consolation in a distressed one."

1393
01:34:57,425 --> 01:34:58,824
- Come on.
- So I've been trying to figure out

1394
01:34:58,893 --> 01:35:02,329
that moment in <i>Persuasion</i> when
Wentworth and Anne

1395
01:35:02,430 --> 01:35:04,762
just began to stop hating each other.

1396
01:35:06,200 --> 01:35:08,430
Maybe it's when they went
with everyone to Lyme.

1397
01:35:08,502 --> 01:35:10,436
After Louisa Musgrove fell.

1398
01:35:10,504 --> 01:35:13,166
After Wentworth used her
to make Anne jealous.

1399
01:35:13,240 --> 01:35:14,832
You think he was using Louisa?

1400
01:35:14,909 --> 01:35:17,241
Yeah. That's one interpretation.

1401
01:35:18,713 --> 01:35:21,910
- I think the guy was just trying to feel...
- Valued again.

1402
01:35:21,982 --> 01:35:23,745
It was a bonehead move.

1403
01:35:23,818 --> 01:35:25,683
I mean, he knows he's nothing
without Anne.

1404
01:35:25,753 --> 01:35:28,278
He loved her then, he loves her now.

1405
01:35:28,956 --> 01:35:31,982
I like how Austen always lets the men
explain themselves.

1406
01:35:32,059 --> 01:35:34,550
Darcy writes a letter to Elizabeth Bennet
in <i>Pride and Prejudice,</i>

1407
01:35:34,628 --> 01:35:35,993
and Frank writes to Emma.

1408
01:35:36,063 --> 01:35:39,931
Yeah, in <i>Persuasion,</i> everything hangs on
Wentworth leaving her that note

1409
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:43,868
- when everybody's talking all around them.
- Yeah. Yeah. Sneaky.

1410
01:35:45,573 --> 01:35:48,371
No, smart guy. Perfect timing.

1411
01:35:48,876 --> 01:35:49,968
Yeah.

1412
01:35:51,679 --> 01:35:55,547
Let us never underestimate the power
of a well-written letter.

1413
01:35:56,751 --> 01:35:59,242
Grigg has always loved dogs.

1414
01:35:59,320 --> 01:36:01,845
You know, we were never allowed
to have one when we were kids.

1415
01:36:01,922 --> 01:36:04,720
Dogs and books. That's our Grigg.

1416
01:36:05,459 --> 01:36:09,225
Okay, he'd kill me for saying this,
but my brother likes you.

1417
01:36:09,296 --> 01:36:13,198
I'm figuring he'll never tell you.
And this way it's up to you.

1418
01:36:13,834 --> 01:36:17,964
My sisters and me,
I wouldn't say we ruined him,

1419
01:36:18,038 --> 01:36:21,997
but he's just way too considerate
to make the first move.

1420
01:36:23,410 --> 01:36:25,139
- Hey.
- Hey.

1421
01:36:25,212 --> 01:36:29,615
I was just wishing that Austen
had written a bunch more books, you know?

1422
01:36:30,351 --> 01:36:32,114
I'm gonna miss this.

1423
01:36:32,319 --> 01:36:35,618
<i>"All of the ladies were contented to pass</i>
<i>quietly and carefully down the steep flight,</i>

1424
01:36:35,689 --> 01:36:36,781
"excepting Louisa.

1425
01:36:36,891 --> 01:36:39,382
"She must be jumped down them
by Captain Wentworth.

1426
01:36:39,460 --> 01:36:42,156
"She was safely down and instantly,
to show her enjoyment,

1427
01:36:42,229 --> 01:36:44,163
"ran up the steps to be jumped down again.

1428
01:36:44,231 --> 01:36:46,893
"He advised her against it, but no..."

1429
01:38:19,159 --> 01:38:20,319
Shoot.

1430
01:39:18,052 --> 01:39:21,749
I'm so sorry. I should've called first.
I read these books.

1431
01:39:22,756 --> 01:39:24,087
I love them.

1432
01:39:24,158 --> 01:39:25,250
I couldn't stop reading.

1433
01:39:25,326 --> 01:39:29,057
I went to the all-night newsstand on
State Street to buy <i>Searoad,</i> the next one,

1434
01:39:29,129 --> 01:39:32,565
- but they didn't have it, and...
- Do you wanna borrow <i>Searoad?</i>

1435
01:39:32,633 --> 01:39:35,193
I mean, I have... You know, there...

1436
01:39:36,470 --> 01:39:39,405
There are other writers that you might like.

1437
01:40:11,905 --> 01:40:12,963
Hey.

1438
01:40:14,475 --> 01:40:15,840
Hi, honey.

1439
01:40:16,510 --> 01:40:18,910
I didn't expect you back so soon.

1440
01:40:32,559 --> 01:40:34,186
Wait, wait, wait.

1441
01:41:10,431 --> 01:41:13,298
Hey, has anyone read those
Patrick O'Brian novels?

1442
01:41:13,367 --> 01:41:16,234
- British Navy.
- Yeah. Jane Austen's navy, 1805.

1443
01:41:16,303 --> 01:41:18,294
Yeah. But aren't there, like, 20 of them?

1444
01:41:18,372 --> 01:41:20,704
- There's more of us now.
- I'm in.

1445
01:41:23,811 --> 01:41:27,440
- Oh, my God, is that Bernadette?
- I thought she was in Costa Rica.

1446
01:41:27,514 --> 01:41:31,951
<i>Buenas noches,</i> everyone.
This is <i>Senor</i> Obando.

1447
01:41:32,019 --> 01:41:33,919
<i>- Hola.</i>
- Hello.

1448
01:41:33,987 --> 01:41:37,252
- Hello.
- He's working on his English.

1449
01:41:37,324 --> 01:41:39,724
- I'm working on my Spanish.
- Hello.

1450
01:41:41,762 --> 01:41:44,458
And so far I have <i>te amo.</i>

1451
01:41:45,699 --> 01:41:46,791
And <i>mi esposo.</i>

1452
01:41:46,900 --> 01:41:48,595
- Oh, my God!
- Congratulations!

1453
01:41:48,669 --> 01:41:52,503
- That's incredible!
- That's incredible. Congratulations!

1454
01:41:52,573 --> 01:41:54,370
- Oh, it's gorgeous.
- Thank you.

1455
01:41:54,441 --> 01:41:55,499
- I'm so happy for you.
- Congratulations.

1456
01:41:55,576 --> 01:41:59,273
- Dad, check it out.
- Well, let's get you a drink, Mr. Darcy.

1457
01:42:04,084 --> 01:42:06,484
- Don't be gone too long.
- Yikes. That makes seven.

1458
01:42:06,553 --> 01:42:07,952
- What?
- Yeah.

1459
01:42:11,925 --> 01:42:13,688
Hey, guys. Guys.

1460
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:16,092
He hasn't read a word of Austen.

1461
01:42:18,499 --> 01:42:19,966
Oh, poor man.

1462
01:42:20,734 --> 01:42:23,703
Ah, yeah. We'll fix that.

1463
01:42:26,140 --> 01:42:27,767
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

1464
