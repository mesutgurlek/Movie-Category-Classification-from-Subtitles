1
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,800
I remember before I was born...

2
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:06,200
...wadded up like a fur ball
in the highly overrated foetal position.

3
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,300
Luckily, I'm not claustrophobic...

4
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,900
...but on rainy days,
I still feel a tightness in my left shoulder.

5
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,800
Now that my stepmother's pregnant...

6
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,200
...I understand
what the baby's going through...

7
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,900
...and I'm not jealous at all.

8
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,000
Really, not at all.

9
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,600
- You're not eating your meatloaf.
- Lf I eat it, I'll throw up.

10
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:27,300
- You should at least try a little bit.
- Then I'll throw up a little bit.

11
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:30,000
Are you sure
you wanna get involved in this?

12
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,700
Try to scrunch these chairs together more.

13
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,800
Dad, I'm trying to.
They're chairs. They don't scrunch.

14
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,200
I'll get it.

15
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,700
We'll just set up
more chairs in the library...

16
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,900
...and pipe the sermon in like once before.

17
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,200
Fix that speaker. It makes the minister
sound like an astronaut.

18
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,800
- Hello, Judy
- Hi, Arthur.

19
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,800
- Hi, Judy. Come on in.
- Hi, Mr. Sultenfuss.

20
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,400
Look who I found.

21
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,600
Hi, Judy.

22
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Hi.

23
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,300
Come on in.

24
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,600
That's okay.

25
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,800
It's just a corpse.

26
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,400
I know that.

27
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,100
You should see a body
that's been dead for a couple of days...

28
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,200
...and they haven't found it yet...

29
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,500
...'cause it was in an apartment,
and no one came to visit.

30
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,400
Or floating in a river.

31
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,600
And then the body starts turning
this weird shade of green.

32
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,400
You know, like watery pea soup?

33
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,000
The arms and legs deteriorate first.

34
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:25,200
The body looks like a raisin
with four fat legs.

35
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,800
Anyway.

36
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,400
This is why
I'm seriously considering cremation.

37
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,400
Judy?

38
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,200
Judy!

39
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,200
I think you lost on the raisin
with the four fat legs, honey.

40
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,600
<i>Did you hear that, Dean?</i> You can stay.

41
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,800
<i>- Dean?</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

42
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,700
<i>Dean Martin. Look at his eyes.</i>

43
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,300
<i>- They're pink.</i>
<i>- Exactly. Dean Martin.</i>

44
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,500
<i>- The cage is all set.</i>
<i>- Where's the bathroom?</i>

45
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,600
<i>Are you kidding?</i>
<i>Hamsters don't go to the bathroom.</i>

46
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,500
<i>Did you look in the bag?</i>

47
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,900
I got a card from your Uncle Phil
in Los Angeles today.

48
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,700
Said he went body surfing.

49
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,800
I don't know if I can picture
Uncle Phil body surfing.

50
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,500
I don't know if I want to.

51
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:21,400
Vada, I wanna ask you a favour.
You can absolutely say no if you want to.

52
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,200
I'm just bringing it up for discussion.

53
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,200
But Harry, I thought we decided
we weren't gonna do this.

54
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,800
Do what?

55
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:37,900
The thing is, your room's
right next to ours, and so, we thought...

56
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,600
...I thought, we might move you
to Gramoo's room...

57
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,000
...and we use your old room
for the nursery.

58
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,600
We're gonna be up half the night
with the newborn...

59
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,000
You want me to move?

60
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,300
Well, not far. Just down the hall.

61
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,200
Plus, Gramoo's room is a lot bigger.

62
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,200
And you get a view of the neighbourhood.

63
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,400
Okay. No problem.

64
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,000
Okay, thanks. Attagirl.

65
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:09,900
Harry?

66
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,000
I'm sorry to interrupt, honey,
but Vada's upset.

67
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,600
She's fine. She'll love her new room.

68
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,700
Look, we react to every kick
this baby gives.

69
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,800
Maybe Vada's trying
to tell us something, too.

70
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:31,200
The thing to remember is
you must visualise a spare.

71
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:35,400
The parabola of the arcing ball must
intersect with the pyramid of the pins...

72
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:38,000
...at precisely this angle of attack.

73
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,000
Shit.

74
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,200
"Visualise" a spare?

75
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,200
Well, you know what I mean.

76
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,400
So, what's on your mind?

77
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,100
Me? What makes you think
there's something on my mind?

78
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,300
You're passing up Archie Bunker
to go bowling.

79
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,000
You've gotta have an angle.

80
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,300
No, I just...

81
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,100
...thought it'd be nice if the two of us
had an evening out so we could talk.

82
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,600
- Shelly's already told me all about sex.
- She told me, too.

83
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,500
I mean, she told me
she told you about sex.

84
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,300
I personally knew about sex
long before I met Shelly.

85
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,000
I figured you did.

86
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,500
Yes.

87
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,700
Strike. Not bad at all.

88
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,200
No, this talk isn't about sex.

89
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:44,700
There've been a lot of changes,
and you're upset about losing your room...

90
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,900
...but the baby's gotta go somewhere.

91
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,800
No, it's okay. I understand. Really.

92
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,600
Honey, that's very mature.

93
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,500
I'm proud of you, Vada.

94
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,100
Maybe I should move to China.

95
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,500
One kid per family.
That way you don't lose your room.

96
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,900
Just keep your room,
and we'll put the baby in the backyard.

97
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,300
Don't do that.
We've got the whole garage.

98
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,200
Right between the power mower
and the weedkiller.

99
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,100
Dad, I'm kidding.

100
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,900
You can have the room.

101
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,300
- Seriously?
- Seriously.

102
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,400
Great.

103
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,300
I'm 13.

104
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,500
Maybe it's about time
I got my own apartment.

105
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:34,500
- My mother can't have any more kids.
- Neither can mine.

106
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,500
She's dead.

107
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,100
It's Shelly who's pregnant.

108
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,800
What do you think?

109
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,300
I'm leaning towards "Passion Flower."

110
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:49,100
"It combines the traditional floral scent
with the musky aroma of sandalwood."

111
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,300
- What are you staring at?
- It's Kevin.

112
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,000
I don't want him to see me.

113
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:00,200
- See you? He can smell you from there.
- Oh, God, he's coming over here.

114
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,900
Act natural, totally natural.

115
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,900
- Hi, Kevin.
- Hi.

116
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,800
You look cool, Sultenfuss.
You look like a grasshopper.

117
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,800
- What's the matter?
- He likes you.

118
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:26,500
Likes me?
He said I look like a grasshopper.

119
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,500
Boys always pretend they hate you
when they like you.

120
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:30,900
That's ridiculous.

121
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
So, if you really can't stand someone...

122
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,800
...then you pretend
that you're really crazy about them?

123
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,100
I don't know.

124
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,500
And I don't care. Kevin's a jerk,
and I don't like him anymore.

125
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,100
He's all yours.

126
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:46,600
<i>If "grasshopper" is a term of endearment,</i>
<i>I've got a lot to learn.</i>

127
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,900
So, have you guys thought
of any new names for the baby?

128
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,400
Yeah. If it's a girl,
I'm kind of leaning toward Esme.

129
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,500
Esme?

130
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:01,900
Yeah, that kinda sounds like a noise
your nose makes.

131
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,600
"Esme." I mean it's...

132
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:06,600
- And what if it's a boy?
- Well, Harry Jr., of course.

133
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:10,300
When a boy likes you,
does he pretend that he doesn't like you?

134
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,600
If he pretends not to like you,
how do you tell he likes you?

135
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,500
What boy likes you?

136
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,300
It's just a question. It's not about anybody.

137
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,800
Here comes puberty.

138
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:23,100
Vada, I think what you're talking about
is the fear of rejection.

139
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,000
See, men will do anything
to avoid looking foolish.

140
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,100
Shell, that's ridiculous.
Where are my needlenose pliers?

141
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,700
If a boy wants to do homework with you...

142
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:34,300
...it means he hasn't the nerve
to ask you on a date.

143
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,600
You get your homework together,
and the next thing you know...

144
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:41,300
...you're ordering pizza and talking about
your favourite movie stars.

145
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,400
So, you're saying...

146
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,000
What are you saying?

147
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,400
Guys don't wanna appear overanxious.

148
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,900
If there's a boy that might like you,
let him know that you like him...

149
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:00,200
...so he won't feel he's taking such a risk
when he's thinking of asking you out.

150
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,300
Okay?

151
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,300
- Hi.
- Hi.

152
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,700
Wanna help me pick out wallpaper
for my new room tomorrow?

153
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,600
- I don't know, I mean...
- Is it okay if I drink this?

154
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,600
It's okay with me. Hi, Kevin.

155
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,700
Well, if it isn't Vada, the grasshopper girl.

156
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,800
Stop it, Kevin.

157
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,800
I was kidding. It's a joke, okay?

158
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,100
We were just doing our homework.

159
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,900
Next thing you know,
you'll be ordering pizza...

160
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,400
...and talking about
your favourite movie stars.

161
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,400
See you.

162
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:30,600
<i>In the future, I think I'll stick</i>
<i>to asking Dad for advice on embalming.</i>

163
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,700
I read an article that says...

164
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,300
...if you sing to the baby
it's a calming influence.

165
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,500
Assuming the baby's a Supremes fan.

166
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:20,100
- I bet your mum sang to you.
- Lf there was an article about it, she did.

167
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,700
- She was always reading.
- I know. It runs in the family. New book?

168
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:26,100
<i>The Collected Works of Alfred Beidermeyer.</i>

169
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,700
Her favourite poet.

170
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,600
Never heard of him.

171
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,100
Excuse me.

172
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:37,000
- How about a nice glass of milk?
- With taco chips so I can dunk.

173
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
You know, Vada...

174
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:46,900
...being an older sister, you're gonna be
very important in this baby's life.

175
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,500
They're enormous, I know.

176
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,300
Is there milk in them already?

177
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,700
No, the milk comes when the baby comes.

178
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,000
When did you...

179
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,000
I mean...

180
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,800
I was a very late developer.
They used to call me "Shelly-Two-Backs."

181
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,500
All my friends had real bras,
not like the training ones I had.

182
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:18,300
Why do they call them training bras?
It's not like learning to ride a bike.

183
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,600
I know.

184
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:23,300
It's just sort of preparing you
for the rest of your life.

185
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,000
It's not easy being a woman.

186
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,700
You're telling me.

187
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:31,800
<i>All the great writers</i>
<i>ponder the meaning of life and death.</i>

188
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:34,300
<i>I've been thinking a lot about</i>
<i>my mother recently...</i>

189
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,000
<i>... even though I don't have</i>
<i>any memories of her.</i>

190
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:40,700
<i>I wish I could see her just once,</i>
<i>even if it were only in a dream.</i>

191
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,100
<i>I know she'd help me figure things out.</i>

192
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:48,300
<i>"Bless me now with your fierce tears,</i>
<i>I pray</i>

193
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,400
<i>"Do not go gentle into that good night</i>

194
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:57,600
"Rage, rage against the dying of the light"

195
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,500
What do you think
Dylan Thomas is saying here?

196
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,300
"Rage against the dying of the light"

197
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:07,200
He's mad
'cause they shut off his electricity?

198
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:11,200
He was referring to life energy,
Mr. Phillips...

199
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:15,000
...which, in your case,
wouldn't cause much of a power shortage.

200
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,700
The poem is really about attitude.

201
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,100
It's about not giving up.

202
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,600
It's easy to be
overwhelmed sometimes, but...

203
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:33,100
...that's when we should
force ourselves to push on.

204
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,300
Alfred Beidermeyer said:

205
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,600
"To heed the urgent inner voice...

206
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,800
"...embracing destiny, not choice."

207
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,200
That's very good, Vada.

208
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,200
All right, moving on.

209
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:51,000
I want to give you guys a chance to write.

210
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,200
Listen up!

211
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,600
I want you to write about
someone very special.

212
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:01,000
Someone interesting.
Someone you admire.

213
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,900
Someone who's achieved something
worth writing about.

214
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,900
But it's gotta be a stranger.
Someone you've never met.

215
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,200
I want you to investigate the personal side.

216
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:14,600
Play Perry Mason,
see what you can come up with. All right?

217
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,000
Any ideas?

218
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:22,300
Remember two things:
Someone who has achieved something...

219
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,600
...and someone you've never met.

220
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,300
- Kevin?
- Elvis, the King.

221
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,600
Elvis, the King.

222
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,300
- Devin?
- Farrah Fawcett.

223
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,400
I love to watch that girl run.

224
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,600
Why is that, Mr. Reed?

225
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,300
Never mind.

226
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,500
Vada, what about you?
Who have you come up with?

227
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,800
My mother.

228
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,500
Your mother?

229
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,300
I never met my mother.

230
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,800
I know my mum's favourite colour
was pink and she ate peanut butter...

231
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:07,300
...and banana sandwiches for breakfast, but
that's not what I would call "hard facts."

232
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,900
- I told you about the pumpkin, didn't I?
- No.

233
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,500
I bought her this huge pumpkin
for Halloween.

234
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,800
She couldn't bear to carve it
so she saved it.

235
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,600
It ended up under the Christmas tree.

236
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,100
Then Gramoo said on Christmas Eve
there was this sickening smell...

237
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,000
...permeating the entire house.
- No.

238
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,600
When I picked it up, it sort of exploded
and liquefied at the same time.

239
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:29,300
It wasn't funny.
It soaked through Gramoo's Oriental.

240
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,900
There's still a big spot on the floor.

241
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:38,000
Okay. We need wallpaper paste.
Hey, Cece.

242
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,800
Isn't there anything else you remember?

243
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,700
How did you propose? Was it romantic?

244
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:47,500
I kinda just blurted it out
over a root beer float.

245
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,600
Root beer float, that sounds good.

246
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:55,200
Did she mention any contest that she won?
I mean, she must have had some awards.

247
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,100
She was so talented and all.

248
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:58,600
She was talented.

249
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,200
Honey, I wish I could help you a little more.

250
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:04,500
It's just that your mother and I
had kind of a whirlwind courtship.

251
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,800
She came to town
with a travelling theatre group.

252
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I proposed on our second date,
two weeks later we were married.

253
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:13,100
Almost nine months later,
you were here and she was gone.

254
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:16,100
- Was it a nice funeral?
- Yes. Lovely funeral.

255
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,600
Grenaldi Brothers did a beautiful job.

256
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,800
Lots of pink roses,
and I used the white hearse.

257
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:25,200
How about this flowered wallpaper
for your room?

258
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,100
How about this?

259
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,600
- Hi, Mr. Owett.
- Hey, Veda.

260
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,200
- How's your report coming?
- Great.

261
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,600
I have so much to say,
I hardly know where to start.

262
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:48,000
I've been rereading Virginia Woolf.
I think she'd be a natural for you.

263
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,500
She led a fascinating life.

264
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,600
Thanks, but I think
I'm gonna stick to my mum.

265
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,700
She led a fascinating life, too.

266
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,500
I'm sure she did.

267
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:06,200
He was giving you an easy out so you
didn't have to write about your mother.

268
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,000
But I want to write about her.

269
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,200
You're crazy.
What was her big achievement?

270
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,300
- Did she invent gravity?
- No one invented gravity.

271
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,200
It just exists.

272
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,500
Then what did she do?

273
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,700
Well, I'm not supposed to talk about it...

274
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:22,100
...but since I'm going to write about it,
I might as well tell you.

275
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,000
She was a spy against the Russians.

276
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,700
Please. Who do you think you're kidding?

277
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,900
And where did she spy
on the Russians from?

278
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,400
Here in Pennsylvania?

279
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,800
No, not here in Pennsylvania.

280
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,900
She went to Russia undercover
with her acting troupe...

281
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,400
...and got a lot of highly sensitive
secret plans sent back.

282
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,100
Just when she was about to go home,
she got caught and they killed her.

283
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:47,100
So, when did she have you
between all of her acting...

284
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,200
...and spying and getting caught?

285
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,500
That's simple.

286
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:54,400
She was pregnant with me
when she went to Russia, but didn't know.

287
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:57,300
When the Russians found out,
they waited to shoot her.

288
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,500
You're not allowed to kill pregnant women
anywhere in the world.

289
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,900
So she had you in jail in Russia?

290
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,900
Well, actually, I was born in Siberia
and then they shot her...

291
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,100
...and sent me home to my dad.

292
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:12,800
If bullshit wore a bra, you'd be top-heavy.

293
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,200
Come on, Judy.

294
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,700
Ask anyone. Ask my dad.

295
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,100
It could be true.

296
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,800
<i>How come guys talk so much</i>
<i>when they have nothing to say...</i>

297
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,600
<i>... and girls have plenty to say,</i>
<i>but no one'll listen?</i>

298
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:48,800
I used to come down here
and sleep on this spot when I was little.

299
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
My report's gonna be a disaster.

300
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,300
Everything I know about her
fits into one little box.

301
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,300
A box?

302
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,200
Oh, Vada, what a sweet baby book!

303
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:12,300
It's only filled out to page two.

304
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:17,400
I was eight pounds, four ounces.

305
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,300
There are so many programmes.

306
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,300
She was in a lot of plays.

307
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,700
Dad said that when she was on stage...

308
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,500
...she held the audience
in the palm of her hand.

309
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,500
What's this? "December 8, 1958."

310
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,500
I don't know. Dad doesn't either.

311
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:38,200
Well, it must mean something.

312
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,600
She was obviously very sentimental.

313
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:44,100
This, that's one of my favourite things,
her passport.

314
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,600
Vada, she's so beautiful.

315
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,800
"Margaret Ann Muldovan,
born in Los Angeles, California...

316
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,900
"...February 7, 1936." Aquarius.

317
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:01,500
Margaret's my middle name,
but everybody called her Maggie.

318
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,900
- Los Angeles. Have you ever been there?
- No.

319
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,800
You know, they say that it never rains...

320
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:12,100
...that you can barbecue on Christmas Day.

321
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:16,700
Instead of riding your bike,
you just surf over to your friend's house.

322
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,000
The place is just crawling with celebrities.

323
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,500
I know someone who saw Walter Matthau
picking up his dry cleaning.

324
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,800
Is that why Uncle Phil moved there?

325
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:27,200
Uncle Phil just needed a change.

326
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,400
A little adventure.

327
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,500
I wonder why she got a passport
if she never went anywhere?

328
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,400
Well, you've gotta be prepared.

329
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,800
I'm definitely travelling some day.

330
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,100
Why not now?

331
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,500
What do you mean?

332
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:47,000
How would you like to visit
your Uncle Phil in Los Angeles...

333
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:51,700
...next week, during your spring vacation?
You could do research on your mum.

334
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:54,500
But what about you and the baby?
You need me.

335
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,300
But I'm not due to have the baby
for another six weeks or so.

336
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,900
It would be kind of great.

337
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,900
It would be fantastic!

338
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,800
But Dad will never go for it.

339
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:09,800
You leave your father to me.

340
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,200
You should encourage her
to spread her wings.

341
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:14,500
She can spread her wings
here in Pennsylvania.

342
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,400
You don't send a child to Los Angeles.

343
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,300
She could come back with her ears pierced
and legs shaved.

344
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,600
She's not a child. She's a young woman.

345
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,500
- She's on the brink of...
- Disaster.

346
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,900
- Disaster lurks behind every palm tree.
- You're being narrow-minded.

347
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:30,400
Maybe when she's a little older,
I'd be more than happy to bring...

348
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,700
Hi, Vada. We were just having a little...

349
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,800
You were just having a fight about me.

350
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,900
Wouldn't you like to hear my opinion?

351
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Of course.

352
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:41,700
I think that if I'm old enough
to accept a new baby...

353
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,900
...and old enough to accept a new room...

354
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,600
...I'm old enough for California.

355
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,200
I know it's fun to think about these things,
but...

356
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,700
I already bought a ticket.

357
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:53,200
- What?
- I used my money and got a great deal.

358
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,700
It's a Q47-NR five-day fare...

359
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:59,500
...which means I'll change planes
in Dallas and stay over a Saturday.

360
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:02,900
There's no exchanges or refunds,
so if you don't let me go...

361
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:06,000
...then I will have wasted
my entire life savings.

362
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:14,500
Isn't it against the law
to sell airline tickets to minors?

363
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,800
Don't tell me you aided and abetted
this little scheme?

364
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,600
Vada needed me.

365
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:25,200
The airline requires
the signature of an adult.

366
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:28,300
They forgot to ask for one
who wasn't having hormone surges.

367
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:32,400
Come on, Harry!
We're talking about five days here.

368
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,500
We're going overboard
for just a simple school assignment.

369
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,700
<i>It's not a little school assignment.</i>

370
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:40,500
<i>I think maybe all of this</i>
<i>is happening for a reason.</i>

371
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:42,700
<i>Reason? What reason? What?</i>

372
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:46,900
<i>Phil's moving to LA, Gramoo's passing.</i>
<i>The baby being born.</i>

373
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,700
<i>Vada's report.</i>

374
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:53,900
Maybe all of these are signs. Signs that
it's time for Vada to take this trip.

375
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,100
Signs?

376
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,600
Let me get the Loch Ness Monster
on the phone.

377
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,500
You two have a lot to talk about.

378
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,000
No, I'm sorry.
Vada is not going to Los Angeles.

379
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:07,100
Now, I have made my decision,
and that is final.

380
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,200
And remember, don't talk to anyone.

381
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,900
Even if a nun sits next to you,
don't talk to her.

382
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:13,400
No nuns. Got it.

383
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,500
And no boys. Promise me.

384
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,400
Those LA people are all so corrupt,
you'll end up pregnant and on drugs.

385
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:22,500
Don't run to me when you're in the morgue
with a toe tag...

386
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:25,600
...having been beaten to
an unrecognisable pulp by a surfer.

387
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,300
And don't make eye contact.

388
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,200
It communicates an implied vulnerability.

389
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,700
What does that mean?

390
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,900
It means I'm a paranoid nitwit
who's never let his baby girl...

391
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:38,100
...out of his sight for the simple reason
he's a paranoid nitwit.

392
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:42,500
So, why don't you just say, "Oh, Dad,"
and get on the damn plane already.

393
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,700
'Bye, Dad. I'll miss you.

394
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,900
Thanks. I needed that.

395
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,600
I'll be back in 137 hours.

396
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,600
Have fun!

397
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:04,700
Not too much.

398
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:26,700
<i>It's hard to believe that</i>
<i>my mother's whole life fits into this box.</i>

399
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,300
<i>I've just got to think of this stuff as clues.</i>
<i>Or good-luck charms.</i>

400
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,900
<i>But I need more than luck</i>
<i>to solve this puzzle.</i>

401
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,000
<i>I need a miracle.</i>

402
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:05,400
<i>Arriving passengers, Flight 57,</i>
<i>your baggage is now available...</i>

403
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,300
<i>... on Carousel 2.</i>

404
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:21,100
<i>Arriving passengers</i>
<i>please go to ticket agent...</i>

405
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:23,600
<i>... at the airline's reservation counter.</i>

406
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,600
Are you waiting for someone?

407
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,700
Excuse me, I asked you a question.

408
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:57,700
I'm not suppose to talk to strangers,
not even nuns.

409
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,600
You're Vada, right?

410
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:03,500
- How did you know my name?
- Your Uncle Phil told me.

411
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,500
Where is he?
He was supposed to meet me.

412
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,600
Hey, relax!
You think I kidnapped him or something?

413
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:11,100
This is California. Anything's possible.

414
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:15,000
Well, if I was looking for a victim,
I wouldn't pick your Uncle Phil...

415
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,800
...who outweighs me by about 150 pounds.

416
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,300
Besides, who would I ask for ransom?
You?

417
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,800
Are you suffering from a chemical
imbalance or is it just an attitude problem?

418
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:29,400
My only problem is that your uncle's
given me $5 to pick you up...

419
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,700
...but I don't get paid till delivery.

420
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,600
Gee, that is a problem.

421
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:39,000
Put that down! I'll call the police!

422
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:43,800
What are you gonna do? Tell them that
a polite person helped carry your bag?

423
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,500
You're not very polite.

424
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:50,200
I don't think you're very grateful.
A lot of people would say thank you.

425
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,600
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

426
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:58,900
- I don't even know your name.
- It's Nick. There you go.

427
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,000
- Okay.
- Thanks.

428
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,800
Oh, great! No cabs.

429
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,200
I have a gift for you.

430
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:10,100
- Thanks.
- No, thanks.

431
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:13,500
- He said it was a gift.
- Yeah, right.

432
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:16,500
- Look, I don't need you to be telling me to...
- Taxi!

433
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,700
Get in. Get in!

434
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:25,500
You look like you know where to go.
Where are we headed?

435
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,900
Take the 405 to Santa Monica,
then to Whittier to Sunset.

436
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:47,400
Here you go. See that building?

437
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:51,600
My grandfather built it.
Budapest Auto Repair.

438
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:55,000
That's my room, right up there.

439
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:58,900
One of these days,
this is all gonna be mine.

440
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,700
Uncle Phil!

441
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,200
Vada!

442
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,600
Look at you!

443
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:14,000
Hi! Hi, honey! How are you?

444
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:17,500
- You look great! How's Shelly? Your dad?
- They're great.

445
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:20,000
How about Nick?
Did he take good care of you?

446
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,800
He was very polite. Worth the entire $5.

447
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,500
Well, good to know.

448
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,700
Thanks.

449
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:31,200
Give it back, Nicholas.

450
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,400
But we made a business deal!

451
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:36,900
Whatever happened
to a good-old-fashioned favour?

452
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:40,200
Our family's been dealing
with your company...

453
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:44,300
...for over 40 years. Either the chain
is here or it isn't, and I don't see it.

454
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,500
You wanna come down and explain why...

455
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:49,200
...we can't fix cars 'cause parts aren't here?
Come on.

456
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:52,100
I already have weight trouble.
I don't need your blubber.

457
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:55,300
Are we clear on this,
or do I have to speak with your father?

458
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,800
Thank you.

459
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,300
Yes, yes, I love you too, Irving.

460
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,600
You must be Vada!

461
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:08,800
Oh, what a face!

462
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:13,100
Oh, if I had a face like that,
I wouldn't have to yell so much.

463
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:17,500
I'm Rose. Rose Zsigmond.
Nick's mother, among other things.

464
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,000
You're Nick's mother?

465
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:21,800
Did you think he was raised
by a pack of wolves?

466
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,600
Don't be misled by the haircut.

467
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:24,800
Mum!

468
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:28,300
Who knew when I started working
in the finest foreign car shop in LA...

469
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,600
...I'd also find the light of my life?

470
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,500
Well, he left out a couple of steps.

471
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,400
I've gotta get back to these bills.

472
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,000
Will you help Vada get settled?

473
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:39,100
Come on.
I'll show you where you're gonna stay.

474
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,800
Here we go.

475
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:47,400
Not what you expected
from downstairs, right?

476
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:50,400
Now, we'll put your stuff
over here in this closet.

477
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:55,600
You can unpack later.

478
00:31:57,100 --> 00:32:01,200
This is where you sleep.
Luckily, this sofabed is really comfortable.

479
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,800
I can tell you that
from personal experience.

480
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:07,600
Bathroom. You have to?

481
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,400
Rose and my room.

482
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,300
She lives here, too?

483
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:17,100
That's right. Like one big happy family.

484
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,700
This is Nick's room and...

485
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:23,300
But are you engaged or something?

486
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,500
Dating, seriously dating.

487
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:28,000
You're thirsty.
You want something to drink?

488
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:31,500
Sure you do. It's been a long trip.

489
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:38,100
You see, Vada, marriage is a very big step.

490
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,500
And not something
to be entered into lightly.

491
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:51,200
I just wanna make very sure
that everything is absolutely...

492
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,800
...right before I go jumping into some kind...

493
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,700
Sounds like you have
a fear of commitment, Uncle Phil.

494
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,000
That's ridiculous.
I'm very, what do you call it?

495
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:02,300
- Committed?
- Committed.

496
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:06,100
So, does that mean
you sleep here every night?

497
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,500
Yes, it does.

498
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,900
Well, that's not exactly dating, is it?

499
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:18,800
Vada, I know that traditionally, you're not
supposed to do a lot of these things...

500
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:21,100
...before you're officially married...

501
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:26,500
...but these are very special circumstances.

502
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:31,800
<i>When sex is involved,</i>
<i>it's always "special circumstances."</i>

503
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:38,000
My parents had a brief
but intensely fulfilling relationship.

504
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,100
She's remained a woman of mystery
to this day.

505
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,700
And you're gonna solve the mystery?

506
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:46,700
I got it all figured out.
She went to Wilson High School...

507
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:50,500
...so first thing tomorrow, I'll go there
and get a copy of her yearbook.

508
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:53,500
That way I get the names
of people she was in clubs with...

509
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,200
...and find out about her friends.

510
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,700
Then you'll be all set.

511
00:33:56,900 --> 00:34:00,600
- Sounds like you're very organised.
- I have to be. I only have five days.

512
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,500
Just point me in the right direction and...

513
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:07,100
I'll do better than that. I'll send you off
with your own private guide.

514
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,200
I'd consider it a personal favour.

515
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:21,700
It isn't like you had a whole lot
to plan for this week, right?

516
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,300
It'll be okay.

517
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,600
Here you go.

518
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,500
- What's that?
- $10.

519
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:31,700
- What's it for?
- For the mini-bike fund.

520
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,900
I know you're not crazy
about taking Vada around tomorrow...

521
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:38,700
...so I just want you to know
I appreciate it though.

522
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,500
- No problem.
- You're a good man, Nicholas.

523
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,200
Phil, I think you should consider...

524
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,500
I thought my mum went to school in LA.

525
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,200
We've gotta be closing in
on the Grand Canyon.

526
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,000
I'm sure for a trip to the Grand Canyon...

527
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:43,100
...you'd charge a little more than $10.

528
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:48,600
You know,
eavesdropping is a very unattractive habit.

529
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,400
I wasn't eavesdropping. I was overhearing.

530
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:55,000
I didn't ask for the money.
Phil just gave it to me.

531
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:59,700
Look, I know that all you care about
is your precious mini-bike.

532
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:04,500
It's obvious you have no sense of
historical perspective. I think we're here.

533
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:06,800
Getting off, please!

534
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,800
Excuse me. Pardon. Thank you.
Excuse me.

535
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,700
Where's the school?

536
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:45,800
"Due to a devastating fire, June 17, 1963,
Wilson High School was closed."

537
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:49,400
I can't believe it!

538
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,700
My mother's high school burned down.

539
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:55,300
They obviously have no sense
of historical perspective either.

540
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:58,100
It's not funny.
I mean, what am I gonna do?

541
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,200
Without that yearbook, I'm lost.

542
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:05,100
I can't just walk around looking
for someone with a Wilson High sweater.

543
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,400
- Vada.
- What?

544
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:07,900
Calm down.

545
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:11,400
We just have to ask ourselves
where yearbooks come from.

546
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,700
I mean, they don't appear out of thin air.

547
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:19,100
Watch these machines, now.

548
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:24,800
- This is really very nice of you.
- No problem. I had a mother once myself.

549
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:34,300
If it's in here at all,
it's in the back two rows.

550
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,500
- Okay, thank you very much.
- Happy hunting.

551
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,800
I don't mean to alarm you, but I'm getting
a nosebleed from the altitude.

552
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,600
Just remember the needle in the haystack.

553
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:54,600
I never did understand that story.
Did they find the needle or not?

554
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:58,200
- What difference does it make?
- A big difference.

555
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:03,000
If they found it, we should keep looking.
If not, we're wasting our time.

556
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,400
Oh, my gosh! Here it is.

557
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:13,200
Look, here she is.
"Margaret Ann Muldovan.

558
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:16,000
"Newspaper, Literary Magazine,
French Club, Drama Club...

559
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,900
"...Glee Club, Girls Basketball
and Swim Team.

560
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:23,600
"With Maggie's combo of good looks and
talent, we'll surely see her name in lights."

561
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,100
She was gonna be famous.

562
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:27,500
Yearbooks always set you up
for disappointment.

563
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,800
I want mine to say:

564
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,200
"Nick probably won't amount to much...

565
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:34,800
"...so don't be surprised if you never
hear anything about him again."

566
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:36,900
Can we go?

567
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:39,700
It smells like someone left
their gym bag in here.

568
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:43,700
It's the leather bindings.
I love the fragrance of vintage books.

569
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:46,800
I love the fragrance of chilidogs.

570
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,200
He was on the school paper with my mum.

571
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:54,700
Great. A full page of Tanakas,
15 with the initial "D."

572
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,600
This is gonna be tough.

573
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,900
Don't forget, the girls changed their names
if they got married.

574
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:01,500
I'll never do that.

575
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,200
- Get married?
- Change my name.

576
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,300
You think the guy should change his name?

577
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,900
I don't think anybody
should change their name.

578
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:12,500
That way you can always find them
when you need them.

579
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:14,700
What if you don't wanna be found?

580
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:18,300
Why do you argue with everything I say?

581
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,400
- Hi.
- Can I help you?

582
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,900
Does someone named
Daryl Tanaka work here?

583
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,800
Hey, Tanaka! You got company!

584
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:50,100
It's too bad about your mum,
but at least she went peacefully.

585
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:53,200
I've seen a lot of people
go out the hard way.

586
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:55,200
What do you remember about her?

587
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,800
Well, we worked
on the school paper together.

588
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:02,100
I remember when the Legion of Decency
declared <i>Rebel Without a Cause</i> unfit.

589
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:06,000
Boy, that Jim Backus! What an actor, huh?
What an actor!

590
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:11,700
She wrote this article about censorship
and the First Amendment.

591
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,400
She was really something.

592
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:16,600
Graduation? Some big-deal congressman
saying Senator McCarthy...

593
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:18,700
...was the greatest American ever.

594
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:22,400
Maggie gets up in front of 500 people,
walks out.

595
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:24,300
Couple of people followed her, too.

596
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,600
Took a lot of guts.

597
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,500
Wow, you walked out with my mother?

598
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:31,400
Are you kidding?
My parents would've shot me.

599
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:35,000
I was the president
of the Young Republicans.

600
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,800
<i>Nisei</i>, second generation. Hall monitor.

601
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:40,100
I didn't wanna start World War III.

602
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,600
You saved a lot of lives.
You should be very proud.

603
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:48,700
I'm trying to find out
her greatest achievement.

604
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:52,900
She was the first girl
ever suspended for smoking.

605
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:56,600
Suspended from school? My mother?

606
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:00,600
Everyone was really surprised
when Maggie was turned in.

607
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,700
She got kicked out for two weeks.

608
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,300
What kinda sleazoid geek
would turn her in?

609
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,900
I would do it again!

610
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:09,600
You ratted on my mother?

611
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:11,900
Who are you, Hitler's hall monitor?

612
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:14,500
Maybe you should join a hippie commune.

613
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:16,100
Let me tell you something.

614
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:19,200
Sooner or later, it's gonna be your turn
to take out the garbage.

615
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:22,000
What about giving the other guy a break?

616
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:25,000
What about living in the real world, pal?

617
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,400
<i>Tanaka. Got a minute?</i>

618
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,600
I'll be right there.

619
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:40,100
I'd be a little more careful
of who I hung around with.

620
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,000
Care for a smoke?

621
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:56,600
This'll be great in my report.
"My mother was suspended for smoking."

622
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:58,900
- I think it's cool.
- You would.

623
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:04,200
You'd rather have a mother
that's a member of the police state?

624
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:06,300
Rules are made to be broken.

625
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:10,100
<i>- I want there to be no question...</i>
- Just ask him.

626
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:15,200
<i>... that the President</i>
<i>has nothing to hide in this matter.</i>

627
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,500
- Hello.
- Hi.

628
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:33,200
What can I do for you?

629
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:36,100
I'm staying at the Chteau and the guy...

630
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:40,000
...who runs the garage there said
that you're the best Jag people in town.

631
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:43,400
Well, Enrique is great, and we are the best.

632
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:46,800
- Well, then I have come to the right place.
- I guess you have.

633
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,700
I'm Sam Helburn. Sam.

634
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:53,400
Rose.

635
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,600
- So, what's wrong?
- Nothing. Nothing at all.

636
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:00,700
I mean, with your car?

637
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:04,900
Oh. Oil change.

638
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:08,300
I just drove in from Chicago and...

639
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:10,900
Nice hair.

640
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:12,500
Excuse me?

641
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:14,900
I was commenting on your hair.

642
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,900
Oh, are you a hairdresser?

643
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:22,300
I'm a paediatric cardiologist.

644
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:29,300
You mean you fix the hearts
of little babies?

645
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:33,900
Mostly little babies, but not exclusively.

646
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:39,800
It's all in the hands.
You know, you have nice hands.

647
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,200
- You operate?
- Yes, I do.

648
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:46,400
So, I guess I'll always teach,
you know, because...

649
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:48,900
...it makes a good relief
from the operating room.

650
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:52,700
- I feel I have an obligation to pass along...
- Hi. Phil Sultenfuss. Sorry.

651
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:57,000
- Some kind of problem here?
- No, there's no problem.

652
00:43:57,100 --> 00:43:59,300
Dr. Helburn just needs
to have his oil changed.

653
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:00,600
I see.

654
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:04,000
'Cause usually that doesn't require
such a lengthy consultation.

655
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,400
Well, Rose was being very thorough.

656
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:08,700
Was Rose?

657
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:13,200
Why don't you come in tomorrow morning
at 8:00, when we open?

658
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:15,000
- We'll get started.
- I'll be here.

659
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,500
I look forward to it.

660
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:19,900
I'm sorry. I'll get that for you.
Don't worry.

661
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,200
Made it worse.

662
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:23,800
Get that for you in the morning.
Nice wheels.

663
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:24,900
Thanks.

664
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:31,800
Why was he touching you?

665
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,200
He wasn't touching me.
He was just gesturing.

666
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:36,700
- He was caressing you.
- For God's sake!

667
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:39,300
God? I didn't think
you'd want to invoke God...

668
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:41,300
...because he saw more than I did.

669
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:46,100
Phil, if you want the rights of a husband,
you'll have to ask me something.

670
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:50,300
If not, you'll have to get accustomed
to the rights of what you are.

671
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:53,300
- What's that?
- Right now?

672
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:58,000
An intimate boarder with mechanical skills.

673
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:00,900
Hi.

674
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:03,900
Oh, hi! How's the investigation going?

675
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:06,800
Just call us the "Dead End Kids."

676
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:10,600
- May I use the phone, please?
- Oh, yeah, sure. Help yourself.

677
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:16,000
Anyone with taste, anyone with breeding...

678
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:22,000
A gentleman would choose British
racing green with maybe a tan interior.

679
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:27,100
But when you buy
a red car with a black interior...

680
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:30,100
...and wire wheels,
you have one thing on your mind...

681
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:33,900
...and I'm too much of a gentleman
to say what that one thing is...

682
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:36,000
...in front of the children.

683
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:41,700
Even if I am just a glorified boarder.

684
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:57,300
Hi. I'd like the number
for Stanley Rosenfeld Photo Studios.

685
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:06,900
Photography is an art form,
if you take it seriously enough...

686
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:08,900
...which I happen to do.

687
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:12,000
- Esther, you gorgeous thing, you.
- Stanley!

688
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:16,400
- Smile for the birdie! Hold, hold.
- Stomach in, Harold.

689
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:18,200
Beautiful.

690
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:20,100
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

691
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:23,200
Your mother was something special.

692
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:26,100
To tell you the truth,
I had quite a crush on her.

693
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,600
- Really?
- Who didn't?

694
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:31,200
She could play basketball like Jerry West,
she'd dance like Cyd Charisse.

695
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Then she'd look at you
with those blue eyes, forget about it.

696
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:36,800
I asked her out a couple of times...

697
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,900
...but she always said no.

698
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:41,200
Lenny, Nancy, you just got married.

699
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:43,800
Look happy! Look like you mean it.

700
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,200
Beautiful.

701
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:47,800
I remember those days.

702
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:50,800
Then we all went off to UCLA
and she started hanging around...

703
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:53,100
...with those drama department types.

704
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,000
There was one guy, Peter Webb...

705
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,300
...who's a big director in Hollywood now.

706
00:46:57,700 --> 00:47:01,200
The only reason I know him
is that we were all in a big poetry class...

707
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:04,800
...with this crazy guy, Albert Boderfelder.

708
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,500
- Beidermeyer?
- Beidermeyer, that's it!

709
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:10,100
What a madman!

710
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:12,500
- He's a great poet.
- He is?

711
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:15,000
- Do you know him?
- Everybody did.

712
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:19,100
Walk along Citrus between Fountain
and Sunset any afternoon.

713
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,200
He'll remember my mother, for sure.

714
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:23,800
It was a big class, Vada, and...

715
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:29,200
But, well, of course he'll remember.
Who could forget Maggie?

716
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:30,700
Just one more thing.

717
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:33,300
Does this mean anything to you?

718
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:38,300
No, it doesn't, but I wish it did.

719
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:41,800
Well, thanks for your help, Mr. Rosenfeld.

720
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:44,500
I'm sorry my mother
wouldn't go out with you.

721
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:46,800
I'm sure she would've had a great time.

722
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,200
I would've tried to show her a good time.

723
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:52,600
I promised her that I'd never forget her
and I never did.

724
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:56,000
Stanley Rosenfeld does not forget.

725
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:02,500
This is the street he walks down every day.

726
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:06,500
- When he needs inspiration...
- Boy, you're really into this.

727
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:09,200
He is one of the great poets.

728
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:15,700
I think it's him.

729
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,400
He's writing.

730
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:34,400
Hello?

731
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:39,500
If you're selling Girl Scout cookies,
I'm borderline diabetic.

732
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:42,800
You're Alfred Beidermeyer, aren't you?

733
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:45,200
You had to remind me?

734
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:49,600
- Are you writing a poem?
- No, I'm writing the phone company...

735
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:53,800
...because they keep charging me
for calls to Caracas, Venezuela.

736
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:56,700
Do you know anybody
in Caracas, Venezuela?

737
00:48:57,700 --> 00:48:58,700
No.

738
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:00,400
Neither do I.

739
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:04,700
"Ask not for whom the bell tolls."

740
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:08,100
Time for my medication and my nap.

741
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:15,000
- Here, we'll help you carry this stuff.
- I can handle that.

742
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,800
Oh, thank you. I'm in the penthouse.

743
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:30,000
Penthouse A. It's there, over on the left.

744
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:43,900
If he has a heart attack,
you're carrying the body down yourself.

745
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,700
- At least it gives you plenty of exercise.
- It keeps me young.

746
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:06,600
- Where do you want this?
- Just put it over there.

747
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:13,800
- Do you still teach?
- No, no, no.

748
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,100
I gave it up 10 years ago.

749
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,700
Actually, it gave me up.

750
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:21,400
My mother took this course with you
at UCLA.

751
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:23,500
"Foundations of Poetic Thought."

752
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:27,200
UCLA? My cardigan sweater period.

753
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:29,700
Her name was Maggie Muldovan.

754
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Oh.

755
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:32,800
Remember her?

756
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,500
I've been blessed with a very bad memory.

757
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:38,100
People say she looked like me.

758
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:42,600
I was drinking a little in those days.

759
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:46,400
I'm drinking a little these days, too.

760
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:49,600
I'm sure she found
your lectures fascinating.

761
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:51,300
Oh, I doubt it.

762
00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:55,800
Writers are notoriously boring.

763
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:57,700
No, they're not.

764
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,700
I don't wanna be a writer.

765
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:02,200
I wanna be just like you.

766
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:07,100
Me?

767
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:11,700
My dear, this is not a country
that rewards poetry.

768
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:15,200
This is a country that rewards gas mileage.

769
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:20,500
Besides, people don't read poetry anymore,
they watch television.

770
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,600
Don't be a poet.

771
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:26,300
Be a TV repairman!

772
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:47,800
Vada, come on.

773
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:51,900
I've got a place I always go
when I need cheering up.

774
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,300
The tar pits?
This is where you come to get cheered up?

775
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:01,900
Look at it this way:

776
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:05,100
However bad I feel,
it isn't as bad as becoming extinct...

777
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:07,400
...in a bottomless pit of tar.

778
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,100
And I thought I was weird.

779
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:11,800
You are weird.

780
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,400
Let's just go.

781
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:18,300
Oh, no. Wait.
I like that you brought me here.

782
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:23,700
Hey, what do I care?
I mean, consider the source:

783
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:27,400
A chick from Pennsylvania
who wears a mood ring.

784
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:29,800
This isn't just a mood ring.

785
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:32,400
Does it work?

786
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:35,900
Well, it doesn't open cans or anything...

787
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:40,700
It's sort of a reminder of a friend of mine.

788
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:43,700
Boyfriend?

789
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:46,900
Well, he was a boy. He was my friend.

790
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,400
He was my best friend.

791
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:54,700
When we were kids we were gonna...

792
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:57,500
...move out here and live
with the Brady Bunch.

793
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:04,500
Then, I lost this ring in the woods...

794
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:11,300
...and when he went to find it,
he got stung by bees and he died.

795
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:18,200
Do you think your friend's
up in heaven now...

796
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:21,400
...Iooking down on you,
and watching you all the time?

797
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:27,000
Well, I hope he's not watching me
all the time.

798
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,100
Let me see if it changes colours on me.

799
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Okay.

800
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:41,700
But be careful.
It has a lot of sentimental value.

801
00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:45,800
Maybe it'll fit my pinkie.

802
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:48,600
Well, don't force it. You'll break it.

803
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:51,600
I'm not gonna break it.
I just wanna see it change colours.

804
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,700
I want it back now.
I never should have taken it off.

805
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:57,400
- I want it back.
- Hey, relax! I'm not gonna break it!

806
00:53:57,700 --> 00:53:59,400
- Give it to me.
- Come and get it.

807
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:01,300
- Just give it to me!
- It's right here.

808
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:02,700
Just come and get it.

809
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:04,700
- Right here.
- Don't! Come on.

810
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:06,300
Watch it.

811
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:07,900
Don't!

812
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:11,100
Uh-oh.

813
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:14,600
What do you mean, "uh-oh"?

814
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:17,700
I dropped it.

815
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:19,500
In the tar?

816
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:23,600
It was an accident. I'll get you a new one.

817
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:26,600
Where are you going?

818
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:30,500
Vada, wait up! Wait!

819
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:38,500
- What are you doing? You can't go in.
- Oh, no?

820
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:41,400
- It's dangerous!
- Leave me alone.

821
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,500
That ring is the only thing
I have left of Thomas J. I have to get it.

822
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:49,600
You mean this ring?

823
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:56,700
You jerk! You idiot!

824
00:54:57,300 --> 00:54:59,600
You hit pretty good, for a girl!

825
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:30,400
Nicholas!

826
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:33,200
What are you doing up?

827
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:37,800
I'm thirsty.

828
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
There's water in your bathroom.

829
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:41,600
I want juice.

830
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:44,800
- Don't wake up Vada.
- I won't.

831
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:01,300
I think Maggie could've been
a major player.

832
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:02,900
She had the talent.

833
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:05,600
God knows that face was made
for close-ups.

834
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:08,600
And everything was magic with Maggie.

835
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:12,000
I remember we were walking down
Hollywood Boulevard one night...

836
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:14,500
...and we put our feet
in the stars' footprints.

837
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:17,800
You know, like tourists do?
Maggie could not believe it.

838
00:56:18,100 --> 00:56:20,400
Her feet were the same size
as Judy Garland.

839
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:23,400
'Course, mine matched perfectly
with Orson Welles.

840
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,000
Just kidding.

841
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:30,100
You should call Hillary Mitchell.

842
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:32,500
She and Maggie were very close.

843
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:35,900
She's got this funky little clothing store
over here on Melrose.

844
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:39,500
I'd call her for you, but, well,
we kinda had this thing...

845
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:42,700
...you know, and it got a little messy.

846
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:45,400
Thanks.

847
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:49,700
Would you know what this is?

848
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:51,200
Well, not really.

849
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:56,100
Could be the date of an opening,
an audition, birthday?

850
00:56:56,900 --> 00:56:58,800
Not my birthday. I don't know.

851
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:01,300
Who writes dates on paper bags?

852
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:03,000
My mum.

853
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:06,600
Whoa! I have got to get to dailies.
I gotta break this up.

854
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:09,600
Well, thanks for your time.
I know you're very busy.

855
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:12,000
You are Maggie all over again.

856
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:15,400
You let me know
if you ever want to be a movie star.

857
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,200
You got the face for close-ups, too.

858
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:19,600
Thanks.

859
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:28,500
What a dufus.

860
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:39,000
We may go for coffee after the meeting,
so don't expect us before midnight.

861
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:41,800
- There's fruit.
- You know where the extinguisher is.

862
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,500
If the fruit bursts into flames,
I'll be prepared.

863
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:46,500
You're so clever.

864
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:50,300
- Are you all right, honey?
- I'm just tired.

865
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:53,000
Well, get to bed early
and don't let anybody in.

866
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:55,300
- 'Bye.
- Lock the door.

867
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:12,600
We have lift-off.

868
00:58:14,100 --> 00:58:16,600
Joan Crawford! Oh, I love her.

869
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:18,600
There's the Marx Brothers!

870
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:24,400
- Carole Lombard! My dad's favourite.
- Never heard of her.

871
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,500
Montgomery Clift! Wait till I tell Shelly.

872
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:29,600
Here's Judy Garland!

873
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:39,600
- My mother stood on this very spot.
- I'm afraid your feet won't fit there.

874
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:46,300
That's 'cause I was cursed
with the Sultenfuss bear claws.

875
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,100
- My hands fit.
- Big deal.

876
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:58,000
What's he smoking?

877
00:58:58,300 --> 00:59:00,000
What do you think?

878
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:02,000
Really?

879
00:59:10,700 --> 00:59:12,000
Hey, look.

880
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:23,500
This is a totally barbaric custom.

881
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:30,200
So, if Phil marries my mum,
she'd be your aunt, right?

882
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,100
Right.

883
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:34,100
And you'd be my cousin?

884
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:38,200
Yeah, I guess. Sort of.

885
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:42,200
But we wouldn't really be related, right?

886
00:59:42,700 --> 00:59:45,800
Oh, no, we wouldn't be
from the same bloodlines or anything.

887
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:50,700
We'd be like two total strangers
who accidentally had relatives...

888
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:52,400
...who got married.

889
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:54,800
Good. I mean...

890
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:58,700
Marriage can really complicate things.

891
01:00:02,300 --> 01:00:05,600
So, aren't you gonna say anything
about my earrings?

892
01:00:06,300 --> 01:00:07,700
I already did.

893
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:09,900
It's a totally barbaric custom.

894
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,300
But on you...

895
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:15,100
...it looks good.

896
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:36,900
- We should've called.
- It's not that late.

897
01:00:48,100 --> 01:00:50,100
You're grounded till you're 50.

898
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:52,500
- You're overreacting.
- Make that 60.

899
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:54,900
And I'm docking your allowance
for two weeks.

900
01:00:55,100 --> 01:00:57,000
- Mum!
- You think this is easy for me?

901
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:59,500
You go out and I get to be the bad guy.

902
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:01,500
I don't want you to be a delinquent...

903
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:04,300
...but I can't do my job
if you don't do yours.

904
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:07,300
- It's not his fault.
- No. It was me.

905
01:01:08,100 --> 01:01:09,800
I'm sorry, Mum. Really.

906
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,500
Just tell me what to do. I'll do anything.

907
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:14,200
Go to your room.

908
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:17,600
And you.

909
01:01:17,900 --> 01:01:21,100
Your father didn't give you permission
to pierce your ears, did he?

910
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:22,800
Not exactly.

911
01:01:24,100 --> 01:01:26,100
Well, just don't shave your legs.

912
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:30,300
He'll never let you visit us again if I send
you home hairless and full of holes.

913
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:56,000
- Good morning.
- Well, maybe for you.

914
01:01:56,300 --> 01:01:58,100
- Is something wrong?
- You're lucky...

915
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:00,600
...you deal with kids
who are under anaesthesia.

916
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:05,500
Well, even without anaesthesia,
I always tell my patients to...

917
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:08,600
...relax.

918
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:12,400
Isn't it time for your coffee break
or something?

919
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:15,100
There must be someplace
where we can go, talk.

920
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:17,200
Oh, no, I couldn't.

921
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:19,000
You couldn't?

922
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:21,000
Well, I'm sort of involved.

923
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:24,800
- Sort of?
- Let's just say I'm involved.

924
01:02:25,900 --> 01:02:28,200
Where I come from, involvement calls for...

925
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:30,200
...a substantial piece of jewellery.

926
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:33,000
Oh, well, I don't wear a lot of jewellery.

927
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:37,600
Alright, so you don't like jewellery,
but you do like good music.

928
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,100
Liszt. One of my favourites.

929
01:02:41,900 --> 01:02:44,500
Liszt was my parents' favourite.
They were Hungarian.

930
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:47,600
Hungarians.
Famous for their beautiful music...

931
01:02:49,100 --> 01:02:50,800
...their beautiful women.

932
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,500
Doctor Helburn! What a surprise.

933
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:58,000
In the last couple of days, we've changed
your oil, relined your brakes...

934
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:01,500
...balanced and rotated your tyres,
aligned your front-end...

935
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:04,000
...and flushed out
your entire cooling system.

936
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:07,200
I really didn't expect to be seeing you
for another 3000 miles.

937
01:03:07,300 --> 01:03:10,700
Well, what can I say, Phil?
It's just I feel so welcome here.

938
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,200
And you are.

939
01:03:16,700 --> 01:03:18,600
Why don't I come in the morning?

940
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:21,100
You can check out that left blinker for me.

941
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:23,100
Oh, sure. Okay.

942
01:03:24,100 --> 01:03:26,400
I'll see you then. I look forward to it.

943
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:43,200
We really ought to flush out
that line of bullshit he's got.

944
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:47,400
"Hungarians are famous
for their beautiful women."

945
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:51,800
What's wrong with a little flattery?
What's wrong with a little appreciation?

946
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,900
Are you saying I don't appreciate?

947
01:03:54,100 --> 01:03:56,900
I'm saying he asked me out for coffee,
like a real date.

948
01:03:57,300 --> 01:03:59,100
When was the last time you did that?

949
01:03:59,300 --> 01:04:01,400
What do you mean?
We have a date every night.

950
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:04,800
No, that's not a date.
A date is when I don't cook.

951
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:09,400
I do the dishes.

952
01:04:13,700 --> 01:04:17,200
<i>I'd go to a fortune teller,</i>
<i>but they can only predict the future.</i>

953
01:04:18,700 --> 01:04:21,300
<i>I need someone who can predict the past.</i>

954
01:04:30,100 --> 01:04:33,200
Hi. Can I help you?

955
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:37,600
Are you the Hillary Mitchell who went
to school with Maggie Muldovan?

956
01:04:37,900 --> 01:04:39,500
Maggie Muldovan?

957
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:42,300
Did you know her?

958
01:04:42,700 --> 01:04:44,300
She's her daughter, Vada.

959
01:04:45,900 --> 01:04:47,400
Of course!

960
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:50,800
Look at you.

961
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:54,800
It's the eyes mostly, and the hair, too.

962
01:04:56,500 --> 01:04:58,300
And now she's gone.

963
01:04:58,700 --> 01:04:59,700
She's gone.

964
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:03,800
She'll never get to see
how well you've turned out.

965
01:05:06,500 --> 01:05:07,900
Oh, my God!

966
01:05:09,100 --> 01:05:10,400
Maggie!

967
01:05:11,300 --> 01:05:13,000
You poor thing.

968
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:17,300
It's okay, really. I was just a baby.

969
01:05:20,700 --> 01:05:22,500
I'm sorry. It's just...

970
01:05:23,900 --> 01:05:27,500
...I've been taking all these seminars
to get in touch with my feelings...

971
01:05:27,700 --> 01:05:30,300
...and sometimes it gets outta hand.

972
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,000
Here.

973
01:05:33,700 --> 01:05:36,400
Thank you. You're very sweet.

974
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:41,800
How did you find out where I was?

975
01:05:42,300 --> 01:05:43,700
Peter Webb told us.

976
01:05:45,100 --> 01:05:46,100
Peter?

977
01:05:47,100 --> 01:05:48,300
You saw Peter?

978
01:05:49,900 --> 01:05:51,100
Oh, God.

979
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:06,300
Forgive me. I'm making such a scene here.

980
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:09,400
- Why don't you have a seat?
- Thanks.

981
01:06:09,900 --> 01:06:12,900
I remember Maggie and your dad, too.

982
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:18,000
You know, we used to all pile
into his old '54 Ford pickup.

983
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:21,500
"Chuck the truck" we used to call it.

984
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:25,500
It was pitch black with red leather interior.

985
01:06:26,500 --> 01:06:28,500
Does he still drive that?

986
01:06:28,700 --> 01:06:31,500
No, but sometimes he drives a hearse.

987
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,700
He's an undertaker.

988
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:36,500
You're kidding.

989
01:06:36,900 --> 01:06:39,300
Jeffrey Pommeroy's an undertaker?

990
01:06:42,300 --> 01:06:44,400
His name's Harry Sultenfuss.

991
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:52,300
What are you saying?

992
01:06:53,900 --> 01:06:55,300
Look, I...

993
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,400
Are you saying my mum
had another husband?

994
01:06:58,600 --> 01:07:02,700
Honey, back then, people did crazy things.

995
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:04,600
They sure did!

996
01:07:04,700 --> 01:07:07,900
They got kicked outta school,
they married truck drivers.

997
01:07:08,700 --> 01:07:11,100
These are my mother's
greatest accomplishments?

998
01:07:11,300 --> 01:07:14,400
I'm sure glad I came all the way out here
to find them out.

999
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:25,500
Vada, wait up!

1000
01:07:26,900 --> 01:07:31,400
Just 'cause your mum was married before,
doesn't mean anything.

1001
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,500
Maybe not. But maybe it does.

1002
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:39,600
If no one told me about this...

1003
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,300
Maybe they're trying to hide something.

1004
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:44,100
Like what?

1005
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:48,300
Maybe this Jeffrey guy is my real father.

1006
01:07:51,700 --> 01:07:52,900
Look at me.

1007
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:56,300
I have the hair of a dead person,
and my nose...

1008
01:07:57,700 --> 01:07:59,800
No one in my family has this nose.

1009
01:08:00,700 --> 01:08:03,600
It could be the nose
of a complete stranger.

1010
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:08,500
I came out here to find out
about my mother and I found...

1011
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:10,600
God.

1012
01:08:12,100 --> 01:08:13,300
Don't cry.

1013
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:15,600
Come on.

1014
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:19,400
That lady in there
looked pretty flaky to me.

1015
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:24,300
How bout Phil?
Maybe he knows something about all this.

1016
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:27,800
At least you should talk to him
before you get worked up.

1017
01:08:29,900 --> 01:08:31,700
Before I get worked up?

1018
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:35,700
You don't think this is worked up?

1019
01:08:43,900 --> 01:08:46,000
That thing you said about your nose?

1020
01:08:47,300 --> 01:08:49,000
That it was a stranger's nose?

1021
01:08:49,900 --> 01:08:51,400
It's not. It's...

1022
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,200
I mean...

1023
01:08:54,100 --> 01:08:55,600
It's yours.

1024
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:00,900
Nick?

1025
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:03,000
Yeah?

1026
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:07,300
This has been a real confusing day.

1027
01:09:12,100 --> 01:09:15,000
How could Dad let me visit here
and find out like this?

1028
01:09:19,700 --> 01:09:22,500
I'm gonna call him
and make him tell me everything.

1029
01:09:23,900 --> 01:09:25,100
Sweetie, I...

1030
01:09:25,500 --> 01:09:28,400
Don't worry,
I'll do it in my own subtle way.

1031
01:09:34,900 --> 01:09:36,600
<i>Hello, Sultenfuss Parlour.</i>

1032
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:38,700
- Hi, Dad.
<i>- Hi, honey!</i>

1033
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,900
I just called to say
that I'm having a really great time.

1034
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:45,500
<i>Good. You should go over</i>
<i>and watch them tape Carson.</i>

1035
01:09:47,300 --> 01:09:50,800
Actually, I wanna see Jeffrey Pommeroy.

1036
01:09:52,300 --> 01:09:54,900
Is he some kind of a new rock star
or something?

1037
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:57,800
Yeah.

1038
01:09:57,900 --> 01:09:59,300
<i>Totally groovy, huh?</i>

1039
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:00,400
Totally.

1040
01:10:00,900 --> 01:10:02,800
Ask him if he needs a good tuba player.

1041
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:05,300
I will.

1042
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,200
How's Shelly?

1043
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:09,500
She's fine.

1044
01:10:09,700 --> 01:10:13,600
The doctor just told her to stay in bed
and get a little rest...

1045
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,400
...and stay quiet just to make sure that...

1046
01:10:17,500 --> 01:10:18,500
Okay.

1047
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:21,000
'Bye, Daddy. I love you.

1048
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:24,400
- I love you too, sweetie pie.
<i>- My love to Shelly.</i>

1049
01:10:31,300 --> 01:10:32,600
Shelly's sick.

1050
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:36,500
I have to get to the bottom
of this whole thing and get back there.

1051
01:10:36,700 --> 01:10:38,300
She'll be all right, baby.

1052
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:39,700
Yeah. Right.

1053
01:10:41,300 --> 01:10:43,300
It's pointless to worry.

1054
01:10:44,700 --> 01:10:47,600
I'm not authorised to trace licenses
for civilians.

1055
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:51,800
His name is Jeffrey Pommeroy,
and he used to drive a '54 Ford pickup.

1056
01:10:51,900 --> 01:10:53,600
Black with red interior.

1057
01:10:54,700 --> 01:10:55,800
Please?

1058
01:10:56,700 --> 01:10:58,100
Give us a break.

1059
01:10:58,200 --> 01:11:00,600
All you have to do is make a phone call.

1060
01:11:02,100 --> 01:11:04,400
I thought I told you to lose this guy.

1061
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:09,300
Sergeant, I know I said some things
last time that I shouldn't have said at all...

1062
01:11:09,700 --> 01:11:12,600
I think the phrase was "sleazoid geek."

1063
01:11:12,900 --> 01:11:14,400
I'm sorry, okay?

1064
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:17,300
We gotta find this guy
because he knew Vada's mum...

1065
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:20,500
...and he could tell her stuff
that no one else knows.

1066
01:11:20,700 --> 01:11:22,700
You're still asking me to break the law.

1067
01:11:22,900 --> 01:11:25,500
No, we're asking you to stand up
with Maggie Muldovan...

1068
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:27,200
...like you should've years ago.

1069
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:40,400
Yeah, this is Sergeant Tanaka
from Hollenbeck.

1070
01:11:41,100 --> 01:11:43,300
I need a current address for a Jeffrey...

1071
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:44,500
Pommeroy.

1072
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:45,700
Pommeroy.

1073
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:49,500
He may or may not be driving
a black '54 Ford pickup.

1074
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:53,400
Monday.

1075
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:55,400
I'm leaving Sunday.

1076
01:11:57,100 --> 01:11:58,800
Could you hold on for a second?

1077
01:12:00,500 --> 01:12:03,600
I can't get priority
without a criminal charge.

1078
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:06,400
Charge him with something.
Who's gonna know?

1079
01:12:06,900 --> 01:12:08,400
Me! I'll know.

1080
01:12:08,900 --> 01:12:11,100
Do you wanna be a hall monitor
all your life?

1081
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:17,200
Hello.

1082
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:20,100
I'm gonna need this right now.

1083
01:12:20,600 --> 01:12:21,700
This guy.

1084
01:12:23,100 --> 01:12:25,500
We think
he might be going after the governor.

1085
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:31,000
Twenty minutes? Fine.

1086
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:38,400
Give him a call.

1087
01:12:38,500 --> 01:12:40,800
The worst he can do
is hang up on you, right?

1088
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:44,600
I feel like before I can talk to him,
I have to see his face.

1089
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:49,200
How's this for a solution?

1090
01:12:50,500 --> 01:12:55,000
We'll take a drive over to his place.
You can introduce yourself...

1091
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:57,200
I'd like to see his house, but...

1092
01:12:57,700 --> 01:13:01,800
...I don't know if I'd have the nerve
to just go up and knock on his door.

1093
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,100
I don't think I could go through with it.

1094
01:13:05,300 --> 01:13:06,900
Then we'll keep driving.

1095
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:08,500
You'll decide.

1096
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:21,400
You're awfully quiet.

1097
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:26,600
Do you think I should tell my dad
about Jeffrey Pommeroy?

1098
01:13:29,100 --> 01:13:32,100
I don't know. He's got an awful lot
on his mind right now.

1099
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,200
Maybe some day when the time is right.

1100
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:37,900
Maybe.

1101
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,800
Then again,
your dad's got his own memories...

1102
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,100
...and he's got his own life now.

1103
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:48,900
I think this is a secret,
just between you and your mum.

1104
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:53,000
A secret? I like that.

1105
01:14:24,300 --> 01:14:26,000
This is it, I guess.

1106
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:37,000
Well, we've come this far,
the least I can do is knock on the door.

1107
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:40,200
Want me to come with?

1108
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:43,300
I should do this myself.

1109
01:14:43,500 --> 01:14:45,700
Okay. Take your time.

1110
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,800
I'll go for a walk around.

1111
01:15:22,100 --> 01:15:24,200
Go ahead, honey. Go ahead.

1112
01:15:39,200 --> 01:15:40,500
Hi there.

1113
01:15:43,100 --> 01:15:44,200
Can I help you?

1114
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:47,300
Are you Jeffrey Pommeroy?

1115
01:15:47,900 --> 01:15:49,800
I sure am. Who are you?

1116
01:15:52,500 --> 01:15:54,600
I'm Vada Margaret Sultenfuss.

1117
01:15:56,200 --> 01:15:58,100
- And my mother was...
- Maggie.

1118
01:15:58,900 --> 01:16:00,200
Maggie's little girl.

1119
01:16:03,700 --> 01:16:05,400
I was hoping I'd get to meet you.

1120
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:09,300
You mean you knew about me?

1121
01:16:09,900 --> 01:16:11,100
Who is it, honey?

1122
01:16:11,300 --> 01:16:13,600
It's Maggie's little girl, Vada.

1123
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:16,900
Oh. Oh, my.

1124
01:16:17,100 --> 01:16:19,000
- This is my wife, Emily.
- Hi.

1125
01:16:19,900 --> 01:16:21,000
Hi.

1126
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:25,400
Can you come in for a minute?

1127
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:28,000
I'd like to. Thanks.

1128
01:16:36,200 --> 01:16:37,400
Mummy! Daddy!

1129
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:39,900
I painted you a rainbow. Come and see!

1130
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:42,000
This is Vada.

1131
01:16:42,100 --> 01:16:44,300
Vada, this our little girl, Katie.

1132
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:46,000
- Hi.
- Hi.

1133
01:16:49,100 --> 01:16:52,200
Why don't we let Daddy and Vada
visit for a little while, okay?

1134
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:53,700
- Okay.
- Okay.

1135
01:16:54,900 --> 01:16:56,600
- 'Bye.
- 'Bye.

1136
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,600
She looks a little like me
when I was a little girl.

1137
01:17:02,700 --> 01:17:03,600
Does she?

1138
01:17:06,500 --> 01:17:07,800
I'm glad you're here.

1139
01:17:08,100 --> 01:17:08,800
You are?

1140
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:12,000
Yeah. Come on, let's talk.

1141
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:18,200
We had an assignment
to write about someone we've never met...

1142
01:17:18,700 --> 01:17:19,800
...and I chose my mother.

1143
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:23,100
She was born in LA,
and since my Uncle Phil moved out here...

1144
01:17:23,400 --> 01:17:26,600
...I came to visit him.
Then I looked in her high school yearbook...

1145
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:30,000
...and I called a few people.
One guy said that she went to UCLA.

1146
01:17:30,300 --> 01:17:32,500
Another guy said
I should call Hillary Mitchell...

1147
01:17:32,700 --> 01:17:34,400
Hillary Mitchell? How's she?

1148
01:17:34,700 --> 01:17:35,900
She's great.

1149
01:17:36,100 --> 01:17:37,800
She's a little crazy, though.

1150
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:40,700
Hillary said that you had
a black Ford truck...

1151
01:17:40,900 --> 01:17:44,200
...and this policeman I know
got in touch with Motor Vehicles...

1152
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:47,000
...and he gave me your address
and here I am.

1153
01:17:48,900 --> 01:17:50,600
I told you it was a long story.

1154
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:53,900
That's all right. You know,
you sounded just like your mother.

1155
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:55,800
She told great stories.

1156
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:59,300
Stories with crazy accents
and special effects.

1157
01:17:59,900 --> 01:18:01,000
Special effects?

1158
01:18:01,100 --> 01:18:04,500
Like switching the lamp on and off
when she was talking about lightning.

1159
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,100
Audiences love stuff like that.

1160
01:18:07,300 --> 01:18:09,700
And your mum knew
how to work an audience.

1161
01:18:09,900 --> 01:18:11,700
I don't know very much about her.

1162
01:18:12,300 --> 01:18:14,100
I was hoping that you could help me.

1163
01:18:14,300 --> 01:18:15,100
I'll try.

1164
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:20,500
No one else knows what this means.

1165
01:18:31,500 --> 01:18:34,900
The thing is we always wanted
to work in the theatre.

1166
01:18:36,300 --> 01:18:39,000
We drove out to New York, to Broadway...

1167
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:42,200
...where it was all happening.

1168
01:18:43,300 --> 01:18:47,100
And New York was just full
of fancy French restaurants...

1169
01:18:47,300 --> 01:18:49,600
...and we wanted to get married in one.

1170
01:18:49,900 --> 01:18:52,000
But we were totally broke.

1171
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:56,000
Your mum found this little coffee shop
with tables around the back...

1172
01:18:56,200 --> 01:19:00,000
...and real tablecloths on 'em,
and a minister who worked cheap.

1173
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:02,400
When we got down to the coffee shop...

1174
01:19:02,600 --> 01:19:06,700
...there was a sign on the door that said,
"Closed by the Board of Health."

1175
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:08,900
By that time, it had started snowing...

1176
01:19:09,100 --> 01:19:13,300
...so we just got married
right outside in the snow.

1177
01:19:15,200 --> 01:19:16,600
It was freezing.

1178
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:19,500
But it was wonderful.

1179
01:19:21,400 --> 01:19:26,000
And for our wedding feast,
we had a bag of hot-roasted chestnuts.

1180
01:19:26,700 --> 01:19:28,100
This is the bag.

1181
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:31,400
And she saved it.

1182
01:19:33,300 --> 01:19:34,900
We didn't have a camera.

1183
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:39,300
So she just wrote the date
on the bag and said:

1184
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:43,300
"This'll be our wedding album.
This'll be a day we'll never forget."

1185
01:19:45,800 --> 01:19:47,200
We never did.

1186
01:19:51,900 --> 01:19:53,900
Do you have any pictures of her?

1187
01:19:54,900 --> 01:19:56,900
I've got something better.

1188
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:07,100
We called ourselves
"The Appearing Nightly Players."

1189
01:20:10,700 --> 01:20:13,500
<i>Darling! Where is my chauffeur?</i>

1190
01:20:13,700 --> 01:20:15,900
<i>You don't want I should walk to the stage?</i>

1191
01:20:16,100 --> 01:20:18,700
<i>An actress of my overwhelming talent!</i>

1192
01:20:26,300 --> 01:20:27,900
She's beautiful.

1193
01:20:37,200 --> 01:20:39,400
We performed on the beach one summer.

1194
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:42,400
Everything went wrong.

1195
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:33,000
<i>- Come on, send me away happy.</i>
<i>- Send him away!</i>

1196
01:23:10,200 --> 01:23:12,600
<i>- That was beautiful.</i>
<i>- Thank you.</i>

1197
01:23:13,400 --> 01:23:16,900
<i>- You do it all the time. That was beautiful.</i>
<i>- Thank you.</i>

1198
01:23:39,200 --> 01:23:41,300
She had a beautiful voice.

1199
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:50,100
Would you like to have these movies?

1200
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:56,700
More than anything in the world.

1201
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:02,000
It's good to see Maggie again and you.

1202
01:24:05,100 --> 01:24:06,900
Didn't you ever wonder about me?

1203
01:24:06,900 --> 01:24:10,600
Well, I didn't know about you
until after she was gone.

1204
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:17,000
I thought that maybe you'd be curious
about how I turned out.

1205
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:19,800
I'd say you turned out just fine.

1206
01:24:19,900 --> 01:24:23,800
I guess what I mean is,
my mother married my dad after you.

1207
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:28,200
And then I was born, so I thought that
maybe you got divorced because of me.

1208
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:30,400
Wait a minute.

1209
01:24:32,300 --> 01:24:33,800
Do you think I'm your father?

1210
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:40,500
Honey, I'd be proud
to be your father, really.

1211
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:46,000
It just isn't so.

1212
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,000
Come on.

1213
01:24:55,700 --> 01:24:57,800
Maggie wanted to have a baby.

1214
01:24:59,300 --> 01:25:01,100
And I didn't.

1215
01:25:04,200 --> 01:25:07,400
She didn't want to miss out on anything,
especially motherhood.

1216
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:10,400
It got to be a real problem with us.

1217
01:25:12,200 --> 01:25:14,300
I thought she had plenty of time.

1218
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:16,100
She didn't.

1219
01:25:17,900 --> 01:25:22,100
Anyway, that's why I was grateful
when she met your father.

1220
01:25:22,700 --> 01:25:25,900
He had the sense to love her
the way she deserved.

1221
01:25:27,100 --> 01:25:30,200
Most of all, I was glad that she had you.

1222
01:25:31,900 --> 01:25:33,800
The baby she always wanted.

1223
01:25:34,300 --> 01:25:36,200
I want you to know that.

1224
01:25:44,600 --> 01:25:46,900
I'm gonna use the movies
when I give my report.

1225
01:25:47,100 --> 01:25:49,300
Jeffrey says audiences love special effects.

1226
01:25:49,500 --> 01:25:52,900
You better ace it.
You sacrificed our whole vacation.

1227
01:25:53,900 --> 01:25:57,200
It's a wonderful story
with a very happy ending.

1228
01:26:02,200 --> 01:26:05,600
Sorry, Doc. We close for business
at 3:00 tonight.

1229
01:26:07,700 --> 01:26:09,100
This isn't business.

1230
01:26:09,800 --> 01:26:12,500
I found this wonderful
little Hungarian restaurant...

1231
01:26:12,700 --> 01:26:14,000
...that makes its own strudel.

1232
01:26:14,200 --> 01:26:17,500
I thought you might like
a taste of the old country.

1233
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:21,900
See, there's apple in there and cherry.

1234
01:26:22,300 --> 01:26:26,700
And this is the cheese, but I gotta say,
I think the cherry is really...

1235
01:26:27,200 --> 01:26:30,100
Okay, that does it.
That does it. The strudel does it.

1236
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:32,600
- First it's the brakes, then...
- Wait a minute.

1237
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:37,200
I'm not letting a podiatrist with a Jaguar
full of strudel come waltzing in here and...

1238
01:26:37,300 --> 01:26:39,800
I'm not a podiatrist. I'm a cardiologist.

1239
01:26:40,100 --> 01:26:41,100
Who cares?

1240
01:26:41,300 --> 01:26:43,500
Rose, tell him we have an arrangement.

1241
01:26:44,200 --> 01:26:46,500
What kind of arrangement?

1242
01:26:47,500 --> 01:26:49,500
Yes, what kind of arrangement?

1243
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:53,000
I'd be very interested to know
what kind of arrangement we have.

1244
01:26:54,200 --> 01:26:56,600
You know exactly what kind it is.

1245
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:00,200
Come on, Rose.

1246
01:27:00,700 --> 01:27:02,200
What do you want from me?

1247
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:04,600
I don't want anything
you don't wanna give me.

1248
01:27:04,700 --> 01:27:07,000
Don't settle for any less than you deserve.

1249
01:27:07,200 --> 01:27:08,400
You stay out of this!

1250
01:27:08,500 --> 01:27:13,000
If I had a red XK-150 with a black interior,
I wouldn't be offering relationship advice.

1251
01:27:13,300 --> 01:27:15,000
The interior's colour isn't germane...

1252
01:27:15,100 --> 01:27:19,200
- Rose, this isn't the place to have this...
- I think this place is just fine.

1253
01:27:26,200 --> 01:27:27,800
You know how I feel about you.

1254
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:32,600
You like the way I cook?
You think I make out a great invoice?

1255
01:27:34,300 --> 01:27:37,900
You and Nick and this garage
are my whole life.

1256
01:27:39,400 --> 01:27:40,600
I love you.

1257
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:45,600
Sure, you don't have
the greatest taste in music, but...

1258
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:50,000
...there's not another woman
who could look so sexy in that smock.

1259
01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:52,300
What I'm trying to...

1260
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:58,600
What I mean to say...

1261
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:01,800
Rose, will you marry me?

1262
01:28:02,900 --> 01:28:05,400
You really think I look sexy in this smock?

1263
01:28:06,200 --> 01:28:07,700
Is that a "yes"?

1264
01:28:23,300 --> 01:28:26,700
- Thanks for everything. You're the best.
- No, you're the best.

1265
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,400
I don't want you talking to anybody
on the plane.

1266
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:31,400
Dad already gave me this lecture.

1267
01:28:31,400 --> 01:28:34,000
He'll meet me at the airport,
we'll have some pizza...

1268
01:28:34,300 --> 01:28:36,600
...then we'll have dinner in bed with Shelly.

1269
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:39,800
Sounds great. You give them both
one of these for me.

1270
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:44,600
'Bye, "Aunt" Rose.

1271
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:46,500
'Bye, "Niece" Vada.

1272
01:28:48,900 --> 01:28:50,100
Thanks.

1273
01:28:51,300 --> 01:28:52,600
Well, 'bye.

1274
01:29:04,900 --> 01:29:05,900
Listen.

1275
01:29:06,500 --> 01:29:10,200
I'm sorry you had to sacrifice
your entire vacation.

1276
01:29:11,500 --> 01:29:13,500
Some sacrifices are worth it.

1277
01:29:14,900 --> 01:29:17,100
You mean it wasn't that terrible?

1278
01:29:18,500 --> 01:29:20,500
I wouldn't say it was terrible.

1279
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:22,500
It was kind of...

1280
01:29:23,500 --> 01:29:25,000
An adventure?

1281
01:29:27,400 --> 01:29:28,800
Part adventure...

1282
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:32,900
...part miracle.

1283
01:30:05,300 --> 01:30:07,300
Will you write me a poem?

1284
01:30:09,700 --> 01:30:10,800
No?

1285
01:30:11,300 --> 01:30:13,300
I'll write you 10 poems.

1286
01:30:17,100 --> 01:30:20,800
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, this is</i>
<i>your final boarding call for flight 6-2-8...</i>

1287
01:30:21,100 --> 01:30:22,600
- 'Bye.
- 'Bye.

1288
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:24,800
Look in your backpack.

1289
01:30:26,900 --> 01:30:28,100
Okay.

1290
01:31:21,800 --> 01:31:25,300
<i>"In memory of barbaric customs.</i>
<i>Love, Nick."</i>

1291
01:31:33,300 --> 01:31:35,700
<i>Life is full of barbaric customs.</i>

1292
01:31:36,200 --> 01:31:38,800
<i>I just hope they all end</i>
<i>with a kiss like that.</i>

1293
01:31:58,200 --> 01:32:01,700
- Arthur! Where's my dad?
- He took Shelly to the hospital.

1294
01:32:02,300 --> 01:32:05,600
- Is she okay?
- She was making a lot of noise.

1295
01:32:24,900 --> 01:32:26,000
Dad!

1296
01:32:29,600 --> 01:32:32,400
- What happened to Shelly?
- She just had a baby, that's all.

1297
01:32:32,600 --> 01:32:34,200
We have a baby?

1298
01:32:34,400 --> 01:32:36,400
A boy. You've got a new brother.

1299
01:32:36,500 --> 01:32:38,800
- Can I see him?
- You can do anything you want.

1300
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:40,200
You're his sister.

1301
01:32:41,800 --> 01:32:42,900
What's on your ear?

1302
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:45,200
Shelly?

1303
01:32:52,500 --> 01:32:53,600
Look.

1304
01:32:54,800 --> 01:32:58,000
- He's so tiny.
- I know. Look at his little hands.

1305
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:03,400
- I'm sorry I couldn't come pick you up.
- I was pushing as fast as I could.

1306
01:33:04,600 --> 01:33:05,900
Did it hurt a lot?

1307
01:33:06,900 --> 01:33:08,600
You have no idea.

1308
01:33:14,400 --> 01:33:16,500
- Here, let me hold him.
- Okay.

1309
01:33:18,700 --> 01:33:19,900
- Got his head?
- Yeah.

1310
01:33:20,100 --> 01:33:21,200
Okay.

1311
01:33:22,500 --> 01:33:24,200
- You like that.
- Yes.

1312
01:33:31,300 --> 01:33:32,600
Maybe he's wet.

1313
01:33:33,200 --> 01:33:34,600
Maybe he's hungry.

1314
01:33:35,100 --> 01:33:36,400
He's okay.

1315
01:33:36,600 --> 01:33:38,500
You just have to sing to him.

1316
01:34:24,500 --> 01:34:27,300
<i>Things haven't exactly calmed down</i>
<i>around here.</i>

1317
01:34:27,700 --> 01:34:29,400
<i>I got an A-plus on the report.</i>

1318
01:34:29,500 --> 01:34:33,800
<i>Dad's getting used to my pierced ears,</i>
<i>and Nick's coming to visit this summer.</i>

1319
01:34:34,100 --> 01:34:36,900
<i>Other than that,</i>
<i>I'm busy being a big sister.</i>

1320
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:39,700
<i>I like to tell my brother about my mum...</i>

1321
01:34:39,900 --> 01:34:43,100
<i>... how I got to meet her friends,</i>
<i>and find out how special she was.</i>

1322
01:34:43,500 --> 01:34:45,700
<i>She may not have her footprints</i>
<i>in cement...</i>

1323
01:34:45,900 --> 01:34:48,400
<i>... but she definitely left her imprint</i>
<i>on the world.</i>

1324
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:51,600
<i>And I told him that,</i>
<i>even though it sounds conceited...</i>

1325
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,100
<i>... her greatest achievement was me.</i>
