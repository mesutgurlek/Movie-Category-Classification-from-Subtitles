1
00:00:39,065 --> 00:00:43,857
Mummy got sick.
It happened just like that.

2
00:00:44,904 --> 00:00:48,238
Nobody could stop it.

3
00:00:48,408 --> 00:00:52,192
It isn't fair.
There's no reason.

4
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:58,076
And if we start asking why,
we'll go crazy.

5
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:25,351
Five minutes in the microwave.
Any one of them.

6
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,649
Do you know how to make juice?

7
00:01:33,161 --> 00:01:37,159
Microwave. Five minutes.

8
00:01:52,972 --> 00:01:57,468
Here. It's my shrink.
Call him.

9
00:02:06,527 --> 00:02:10,691
Loss of Spouse Support Group.

10
00:02:10,865 --> 00:02:16,322
Chicago Cancer Family Network.
Parents without Partners.

11
00:02:16,496 --> 00:02:20,873
"Hug Yourself",
"Hug a Friend", "Hug a Shrink" ...

12
00:02:21,042 --> 00:02:26,961
Work hard, that'll save you.
Only work will see you through this.

13
00:02:32,011 --> 00:02:37,219
Don't mind him.
he's just a guy who's lost his wife.

14
00:02:41,312 --> 00:02:45,559
What I think we really need is ...
change.

15
00:02:45,733 --> 00:02:51,154
Good idea. Take a few weeks off.
take Jonah fishing.

16
00:02:52,949 --> 00:02:57,362
No, real change.
A new city.

17
00:02:58,413 --> 00:03:03,454
Some place where I don't think
of Maggie at every corner.

18
00:03:11,175 --> 00:03:14,591
Where are you gonna go?

19
00:03:16,723 --> 00:03:19,807
I was thinking about Seattle.

20
00:03:20,643 --> 00:03:25,638
In a few months, you'll be seeing
women. You'll meet someone.

21
00:03:25,815 --> 00:03:32,945
Move on. fine. that's what I'll do.
I'll just grow a new heart.

22
00:03:33,114 --> 00:03:39,034
- Sam, I'm sorry, I didn't mean ...
- I know. But it can't happen twice.

23
00:05:28,646 --> 00:05:33,771
- The tall redhead is cousin Irene.
- You'll see her disappointed look.

24
00:05:33,943 --> 00:05:40,741
- Harold ran off with the secretary.
- Until Irene had the dog put down.

25
00:05:40,909 --> 00:05:45,736
Your brother Dennis
is professor at Johns Hopkins.

26
00:05:45,914 --> 00:05:51,537
- He's married to ... Betsy.
- The most competitive woman ever.

27
00:05:51,711 --> 00:05:56,207
- How will I remember all this?
- Walter, you will!

28
00:06:08,311 --> 00:06:12,807
- Uncle Milton lost all his money.
- And some other people's.

29
00:06:12,982 --> 00:06:17,561
... in a pyramid scheme. Don't
mention the IRS or the prisons.

30
00:06:17,737 --> 00:06:21,106
Your mother's Barbara.
your father's Cliff ...

31
00:06:21,282 --> 00:06:25,150
- He has electric trains.
- Really?

32
00:06:25,328 --> 00:06:32,659
- Am I what they had in mind?
- Walter, they're gonna love you!

33
00:06:35,171 --> 00:06:40,248
Everybody ...
Annie has an announcement.

34
00:06:40,426 --> 00:06:44,175
Walter and I are engaged.

35
00:07:02,073 --> 00:07:04,196
Bless you!

36
00:07:05,827 --> 00:07:10,868
- Are you all right?
- Maybe it's the flowers.

37
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:15,370
- We'll move them.
- No! I feel terrible, sneezing now.

38
00:07:15,545 --> 00:07:20,622
- This is a very important moment.
- He's just allergic to everything.

39
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,299
Bees.
I'm allergic to bees.

40
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:30,224
He's allergic to all bees. We
have to take adrenalin with us.

41
00:07:30,393 --> 00:07:36,846
- If he eats just a bit of a nut ...
- My head swells, and I drop dead.

42
00:07:37,025 --> 00:07:41,236
- It's the same with him and bees.
- We had salmon at our wedding ...

43
00:07:41,404 --> 00:07:47,193
- A wedding without salmon is ...
- I'm not allergic to salmon.

44
00:07:47,368 --> 00:07:49,859
But you never know.

45
00:07:50,038 --> 00:07:54,166
- You never know.
- He wasn't always allergic to bees.

46
00:07:54,334 --> 00:08:01,629
- What did we do with our champagne?
- Uncle Milton's parole.

47
00:08:01,799 --> 00:08:07,042
- When are you getting married?
- Early June, in the garden.

48
00:08:07,222 --> 00:08:14,220
- What about Harold and bees?
- I'm allergic to bees.

49
00:08:14,395 --> 00:08:18,096
Cold salmon. cucumber salad.
strawberries ...

50
00:08:18,274 --> 00:08:23,435
I'm afraid I am allergic
to strawberries.

51
00:08:24,614 --> 00:08:27,734
Is this all right with you?

52
00:08:27,909 --> 00:08:33,745
I'm the luckiest man-man-man on
the face of the earth-earth-earth.

53
00:08:33,915 --> 00:08:39,953
- That's Lou Gehrig's line from ...
- "Pride of the Yankees".

54
00:08:40,129 --> 00:08:44,875
- "Pride of the Yankees"!
- Baseball. An historical reference.

55
00:08:45,051 --> 00:08:49,796
I would like to propose a toast.
To my kid sister!

56
00:08:49,973 --> 00:08:53,922
To Walter and my baby.

57
00:08:57,313 --> 00:09:01,145
Please eat, before it gets cold.

58
00:09:03,736 --> 00:09:09,691
Here it is. I wouldn't
give it to the Historical Society.

59
00:09:09,867 --> 00:09:14,613
- Oh. Mum ...
- These things are back in fashion.

60
00:09:14,789 --> 00:09:17,956
Grandmother's dress.

61
00:09:19,127 --> 00:09:25,082
- He's a lovely man, Annie.
- He is. isn't he?

62
00:09:25,341 --> 00:09:31,925
And he's a wonderful athlete. We're
going to DC to see his parents.

63
00:09:32,098 --> 00:09:36,226
- How did it happen?
- It's silly, really.

64
00:09:36,394 --> 00:09:41,554
I'd seen him at the office.
He's the associate publisher.

65
00:09:41,733 --> 00:09:45,398
We had both ordered sandwiches. -

66
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:49,733
- and he got my tomato on wheat,
which he's allergic to, -

67
00:09:49,908 --> 00:09:54,368
- and I got his tomato on white.
Amazing, isn't it?

68
00:09:54,537 --> 00:09:59,532
You make a million decisions.
and a sandwich changes your life.

69
00:09:59,709 --> 00:10:02,461
Destiny takes a hand.

70
00:10:02,629 --> 00:10:08,334
We invented destiny, because we
don't want things to be accidental.

71
00:10:08,509 --> 00:10:13,634
Then why did you order the same
sandwich except for the bread?

72
00:10:13,806 --> 00:10:20,770
How many people like tomato
without something else, like tuna?

73
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:24,848
It wasn't a sign.
It was a coincidence.

74
00:10:25,026 --> 00:10:29,320
I was in Atlantic City,
where Cliff was a waiter.

75
00:10:29,489 --> 00:10:33,949
He wasn't supposed to work
that night. What if he hadn't?

76
00:10:34,118 --> 00:10:41,948
He asked me to take a midnight walk.
I told you this a million times.

77
00:10:42,126 --> 00:10:50,336
He held my hand. I looked down
and couldn't tell our fingers apart.

78
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:55,088
- And I knew.
- What?

79
00:10:56,808 --> 00:11:02,431
- What?
- It was magic.

80
00:11:04,524 --> 00:11:11,654
I knew we'd be together forever.
Just like you and Walter.

81
00:11:11,823 --> 00:11:16,200
Walter ... It's quite a formal name.

82
00:11:16,953 --> 00:11:23,122
I knew that your father and I would
have a wonderful time in the ...

83
00:11:23,293 --> 00:11:26,792
... sack, I believe you call it.

84
00:11:26,963 --> 00:11:33,250
It took years before it worked
like clockwork. It takes time.

85
00:11:33,428 --> 00:11:38,553
- We already ...
- Fine, fine. How's it working?

86
00:11:38,725 --> 00:11:43,766
- Like clockwork.
- Oh, honey ...

87
00:11:46,065 --> 00:11:50,858
- It's a sign.
- You don't believe in signs.

88
00:11:55,658 --> 00:11:59,952
They loved you.
I told you they would.

89
00:12:00,121 --> 00:12:03,490
- I love you.
- I love you, Walter.

90
00:12:05,335 --> 00:12:10,577
Did anyone ever call you
anything other than Walter?

91
00:12:10,757 --> 00:12:17,127
- Not even when you were young?
- Not even when I was young.

92
00:12:17,305 --> 00:12:22,014
- Don't you want to drive with me?
- Then I can't get back on Friday.

93
00:12:22,185 --> 00:12:28,104
I forgot your stepmother's present.
When we're old and grey -

94
00:12:28,274 --> 00:12:34,478
- you must remind me to put my teeth
in, so I don't go out without them.

95
00:12:34,656 --> 00:12:37,573
I'll wait.

96
00:12:37,742 --> 00:12:43,033
No, go ahead. We're late anyway.
I'll be ten minutes behind you.

97
00:13:13,528 --> 00:13:16,363
Welcome to "You and Emotions".

98
00:13:16,531 --> 00:13:22,237
I'm Dr. Marcia Fieldstone,
broadcasting live from Chicago.

99
00:13:22,412 --> 00:13:28,248
Tonight we'll talk about wishes.
What's your wish this Christmas?

100
00:13:28,418 --> 00:13:33,127
My wish is to change the station.

101
00:13:33,298 --> 00:13:38,540
- And now: "You and your spleen".
- Not on your life.

102
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,465
Coming up, "'Jingle bells" backwards ,
sung by ...

103
00:13:43,641 --> 00:13:47,805
- Seattle, go ahead.
- This is 'Jonah ...

104
00:13:47,979 --> 00:13:52,688
No last names, 'Jonah.
How old are you?

105
00:13:52,859 --> 00:13:55,895
- I'm eight.
- You're up late.

106
00:13:56,070 --> 00:14:01,776
- It's not so late in Seattle.
- You're right. What's your wish?

107
00:14:01,951 --> 00:14:07,621
- My dad needs a new wife.
- You don't like the one he has?

108
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:11,788
- He doesn't have one.
- Where's your mum?

109
00:14:11,961 --> 00:14:17,632
- She died.
- Well. who can believe this?

110
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:23,590
- I've been sad, but Dad's worse.
- Have you talked to him about it?.

111
00:14:23,765 --> 00:14:29,186
No, that makes him sadder.

112
00:14:29,354 --> 00:14:32,058
'Jonah, is your dad home?

113
00:14:32,232 --> 00:14:36,893
- Is he busy?
- No, he's out on the deck.

114
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:40,236
Can't you ask him to talk to me?

115
00:14:40,406 --> 00:14:46,279
- Wretched woman! Hang up, Jonah!
- No, he'd kill me.

116
00:14:46,454 --> 00:14:51,282
He won't be angry when he hears
how concerned you are about him.

117
00:14:51,459 --> 00:14:56,702
- Want to bet?
- If he yells, you lose a fan.

118
00:14:58,841 --> 00:15:04,547
Dad. there's someone
on the phone for you.

119
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:10,096
His name is Sam.

120
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:15,893
If you've just tuned in, tonight's
topic is wishes and dreams.

121
00:15:16,067 --> 00:15:19,566
We have a listener from Seattle.

122
00:15:19,737 --> 00:15:23,486
Sam, this is Dr. Fieldstone
on Network America.

123
00:15:23,658 --> 00:15:28,901
What are you selling?
Micro-hibachis or knives?

124
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:34,240
Neither. I want to help.
Your son asked me for advice.

125
00:15:34,419 --> 00:15:39,544
- He wants to find you a new wife.
- Who is this?

126
00:15:39,716 --> 00:15:45,339
Dr. Fieldstone of Network America.
You are on the air.

127
00:15:45,513 --> 00:15:49,842
- You called a radio station?
- Sam, are you there?

128
00:15:50,018 --> 00:15:55,854
- Yes.
- You mourn your wife's death.

129
00:15:56,024 --> 00:15:59,523
Your son is worried about you.

130
00:15:59,694 --> 00:16:04,273
Get out here.
I won't go through this alone.

131
00:16:04,449 --> 00:16:08,612
It's hard for him
to talk to you about this.

132
00:16:08,786 --> 00:16:13,532
If we talk about it,
maybe 'Jonah will feel better.

133
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:18,951
- Talk to her. She's a doctor.
- Her first name could be Doctor.

134
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:26,129
- Please.
- Sam, it's his Christmas wish.

135
00:16:26,304 --> 00:16:29,009
- Okay.
- Good.

136
00:16:29,182 --> 00:16:34,425
I know this is difficult.
When did your wife die?

137
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:41,020
- About a year and a half ago.
- Have you had any relationships?

138
00:16:41,861 --> 00:16:46,238
- No.
- Why not?.

139
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:52,073
- Marcia ... or Dr. Fieldstone?
- Dr. Marcia.

140
00:16:52,247 --> 00:16:58,415
- I don't mean to be rude ...
- I don't want to pry ...

141
00:16:58,586 --> 00:17:05,964
- Sure you do.
- Go on, Sam. I'm listening.

142
00:17:06,135 --> 00:17:11,378
We had a pretty tough time at first.

143
00:17:11,558 --> 00:17:15,851
But we're dealing with it.

144
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:22,224
Jonah and I will get along fine,
as soon as I break his radio.

145
00:17:23,736 --> 00:17:26,940
I'm sure you're a wonderful father.

146
00:17:27,115 --> 00:17:31,029
- You can tell a lot from a voice.
- Yes, you can.

147
00:17:31,202 --> 00:17:35,449
But 'Jonah still feels
that you're under a cloud.

148
00:17:35,623 --> 00:17:40,997
- Are you sleeping at night?.
- He doesn't sleep at all.

149
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:45,417
- How do you know that?
- I live here. Dad.

150
00:17:47,385 --> 00:17:50,968
Look. it's Christmas.

151
00:17:54,809 --> 00:17:58,510
Maggie ... my wife.

152
00:17:58,688 --> 00:18:01,689
She really did it ...

153
00:18:01,858 --> 00:18:06,520
She loved ...
She made everything beautiful.

154
00:18:08,656 --> 00:18:12,488
It's tough this time of year.

155
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:19,908
- Every kid needs a mother.
- Maybe you need someone, too.

156
00:18:22,128 --> 00:18:26,837
- Yes.
- We'll resume after these messages.

157
00:18:27,008 --> 00:18:33,545
Sam and 'Jonah, don't go away.
I'm talking to Sleepless in Seattle.

158
00:18:33,723 --> 00:18:37,721
We'll be back
with listener response.

159
00:18:37,894 --> 00:18:44,347
- What's that?
- People call in and dump on you.

160
00:18:44,525 --> 00:18:48,393
This is really fun. And helpful.

161
00:18:54,452 --> 00:19:00,241
- I bet he's tall with a cute butt.
- I bet he hasn't bathed in weeks.

162
00:19:00,416 --> 00:19:03,453
- Yes?
- Tea, with the bag out.

163
00:19:03,628 --> 00:19:10,793
- Maybe I'll just go up to Seattle.
- Don't open his refrigerator.

164
00:19:10,969 --> 00:19:16,390
Men don't cover food, and they
leave it in there till it walks out.

165
00:19:16,558 --> 00:19:21,896
I wouldn't kick him out of bed
for eating crackers. 65 cents.

166
00:19:22,063 --> 00:19:28,777
We'll take a call before we talk to
Sleepless. Go ahead, Tennessee.

167
00:19:28,987 --> 00:19:33,613
I'd like to have his address.

168
00:19:33,783 --> 00:19:37,650
Honey, get in line.

169
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:44,120
- If I could ask you a question ...
- Go ahead.

170
00:19:44,294 --> 00:19:48,422
People who truly loved
are likely to love again.

171
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:54,924
Sam, could you love anybody
as much as you loved your wife?

172
00:19:56,055 --> 00:20:00,349
Well, that's hard to imagine.

173
00:20:00,518 --> 00:20:03,638
What are you going to do?

174
00:20:03,813 --> 00:20:11,026
Get out of bed every morning
and breathe in and out all day.

175
00:20:11,195 --> 00:20:19,369
And after a while I won't have to
remind myself to do it.

176
00:20:21,623 --> 00:20:29,417
And then after a while I won't
remember how perfect things were.

177
00:20:29,631 --> 00:20:33,878
Why was your wife so special?

178
00:20:34,052 --> 00:20:37,503
Howling is your program?

179
00:20:40,016 --> 00:20:44,429
It was a million little things.

180
00:20:44,604 --> 00:20:49,266
When you added them up, it meant
we were meant for each other.

181
00:20:49,442 --> 00:20:53,819
I knew it
the very first time I touched her.

182
00:20:53,988 --> 00:20:59,908
It was like coming home,
only to no home I'd ever known.

183
00:21:00,078 --> 00:21:03,363
I was just taking her hand -

184
00:21:03,539 --> 00:21:08,166
- to help her out of a car.
And I knew it.

185
00:21:09,462 --> 00:21:14,005
- It was ... Like magic.
- Magic.

186
00:21:14,801 --> 00:21:20,506
It's time to wrap it up.
I'm Dr. Marcia Fieldstone.

187
00:21:20,682 --> 00:21:25,011
To all my listeners,
a magical and Merry Christmas.

188
00:21:25,186 --> 00:21:32,434
And Sleepless in Seattle,
call and tell us how it's going.

189
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:35,647
You can count on it.

190
00:22:23,828 --> 00:22:28,704
He sells the best soup ever and
he is the meanest man in America.

191
00:22:28,875 --> 00:22:33,537
- I feel strongly about this.
- Do it.

192
00:22:33,713 --> 00:22:36,286
New Year's Eve. I won't write it.

193
00:22:36,466 --> 00:22:40,713
Listen: "Phone service was
tied up Christmas Eve -

194
00:22:40,887 --> 00:22:45,216
- when a kid called the radio
and said his dad needs a new wife."

195
00:22:45,391 --> 00:22:49,092
2.000 women wanted his number.

196
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:52,473
I heard it. This kid calls up, -

197
00:22:52,649 --> 00:22:58,734
- and the shrink forces
the father to talk about it.

198
00:22:58,905 --> 00:23:02,025
Suddenly he starts talking -

199
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:08,618
- about how he fell in love with her
like these cows in Michigan.

200
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:14,294
The cows that got zapped by stray
voltage. Maybe it was Wisconsin.

201
00:23:14,462 --> 00:23:20,915
Anyway, I was listening to him,
and suddenly I was crying.

202
00:23:21,094 --> 00:23:24,260
Like when I see the ad -

203
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:29,388
- where the daughter gives her mum
the refrigerator with a red bow.

204
00:23:29,561 --> 00:23:35,184
- Or the to kids at the party ...
- Making an album for Grandfather!

205
00:23:35,358 --> 00:23:38,941
That kills me!

206
00:23:39,112 --> 00:23:42,812
Write about it. Whatever it is.

207
00:23:42,991 --> 00:23:48,780
2,000 women calling for a husband?
Women are desperate for love.

208
00:23:48,955 --> 00:23:54,198
- Especially over a certain age.
- It's hard to get married over 40.

209
00:23:54,377 --> 00:23:59,253
- That statistic is not true.
- But it feels true.

210
00:23:59,424 --> 00:24:04,845
- It's true.
- A new book proves it isn't true.

211
00:24:05,013 --> 00:24:09,342
- Did you read that book?
- Did anybody read that book?

212
00:24:09,517 --> 00:24:12,720
Are you done? Where were we?

213
00:24:12,896 --> 00:24:19,812
If someone's a widower, why is he
widowed and not widowered?

214
00:24:21,613 --> 00:24:24,364
Just wondering.

215
00:24:24,532 --> 00:24:28,945
What was that about up there?
What's with you?

216
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:36,914
- Nothing.
- There's something. Tell me.

217
00:24:37,086 --> 00:24:41,166
- Sleepless in Seattle?
- That's what she called him.

218
00:24:41,341 --> 00:24:45,635
Now 2.000 women want his number.
He could be a crack head. -

219
00:24:45,803 --> 00:24:53,384
- a transvestite, a junkie,
or really sick, like my Rick.

220
00:24:54,729 --> 00:24:58,145
Actually, he sounded nice.

221
00:24:59,317 --> 00:25:04,394
Really?
Now we're getting down to it.

222
00:25:04,572 --> 00:25:09,863
I'm madly in love with Walter. He
did a crazy thing the other night.

223
00:25:11,913 --> 00:25:17,749
It was so funny.
What was that?

224
00:25:27,345 --> 00:25:32,422
I've got to go to Boston
for the convention.

225
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:36,598
And I have to visit Winston-Hughes.

226
00:25:37,188 --> 00:25:41,435
Why don't we meet in New York
for Valentine's Day weekend?

227
00:25:41,609 --> 00:25:47,066
- Walter. I'd love to!
- We can stay at the Plaza.

228
00:25:47,657 --> 00:25:54,027
- Ice skate in Central Park.
- Register.

229
00:25:54,205 --> 00:25:59,116
You know ... for dishes.
glasses, silver, everything.

230
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:04,252
How about it?

231
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:10,593
- We'll have dim sum in Chinatown.
- Is there wheat in it?

232
00:26:10,763 --> 00:26:14,512
I don't think so.

233
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:25,318
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, -

234
00:26:25,486 --> 00:26:29,733
- five. four. three. to. one ...

235
00:26:29,908 --> 00:26:34,201
Jonah, wake up.
The ball's dropping.

236
00:27:22,544 --> 00:27:26,707
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

237
00:27:30,343 --> 00:27:34,507
- Kiss Howard.
- Goodnight, Howard.

238
00:29:07,023 --> 00:29:10,273
Can I have half your beer?

239
00:29:10,443 --> 00:29:14,655
Go ahead.

240
00:29:14,822 --> 00:29:20,030
What did I use to say?
"Here's looking at you"?

241
00:29:20,203 --> 00:29:24,331
-"Here's mud in your eye"?
-"Here's to us."

242
00:29:24,499 --> 00:29:28,331
You used to say: "Here's to us."

243
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:36,551
Oh. babe.
I miss you so much it hurts.

244
00:29:54,028 --> 00:29:54,070
You want to tell him? I'll tell him.

245
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:58,234
You want to tell him? I'll tell him.

246
00:29:58,408 --> 00:30:02,026
She's back with another idea.

247
00:30:02,203 --> 00:30:08,076
Sam, I'm glad you're here. I heard
you on the radio. I told everyone.

248
00:30:08,251 --> 00:30:13,127
- We already knew. From Grace.
- Then all of Seattle knows.

249
00:30:13,298 --> 00:30:18,719
I was brushing my teeth and there
you were. I called my mother.

250
00:30:18,887 --> 00:30:23,798
I said. "Turn on the radio.
That's my architect."

251
00:30:23,975 --> 00:30:30,060
You know. it's so nice
when a man can express his feelings.

252
00:30:30,231 --> 00:30:34,359
- I wish I could.
- Claire, is there a problem?

253
00:30:34,527 --> 00:30:38,655
I couldn't sleep last night.
You know what that's like.

254
00:30:38,823 --> 00:30:43,781
My platters
won't fit in the refrigerator.

255
00:30:43,953 --> 00:30:49,493
At parties I use platters, so I want
a Sub Zero refrigerator instead.

256
00:30:49,667 --> 00:30:54,543
- We have to redo the cabinets.
- We'll be into this wall.

257
00:30:54,714 --> 00:30:59,874
- A bearing wall.
- That's a delay of five, six ...

258
00:31:00,053 --> 00:31:05,925
- 12 weeks.
- It's important to get it right.

259
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:10,679
Well. la decorateur calls.
Bye.

260
00:31:14,734 --> 00:31:19,361
It's fate. She's divorced. we don't
want to do this and you need a wife.

261
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:24,027
- Everything intersects.
- Like the Bermuda Triangle.

262
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:39,423
Here's one more. Do you have room?

263
00:31:39,592 --> 00:31:44,005
- Dad, they're all for you.
- Here you go.

264
00:31:46,724 --> 00:31:49,476
"Sleepless in Seattle".

265
00:31:49,644 --> 00:31:54,389
If you can't sleep, try drinking a
glass of water from the other side.

266
00:31:54,566 --> 00:32:01,363
That's for hiccups. Or you can hold
a spoonful of sugar in your mouth.

267
00:32:02,198 --> 00:32:04,570
Thank you.

268
00:32:04,742 --> 00:32:10,745
- But why give them our address?
- They called and asked for it.

269
00:32:10,915 --> 00:32:17,167
"Dear Sleepless in Seattle. You are
the most attractive man I've heard."

270
00:32:17,338 --> 00:32:22,131
They called?
You gave them our number, too?

271
00:32:22,302 --> 00:32:25,338
You have to, to get on the air.

272
00:32:25,513 --> 00:32:29,262
"Dear Sleepless in Seattle.
I live in Tulsa." Where's that?

273
00:32:29,434 --> 00:32:34,594
- In Oklahoma. Where is that?
- Somewhere in the middle.

274
00:32:34,772 --> 00:32:39,980
I won't think about
what they don't teach you at school.

275
00:32:40,153 --> 00:32:45,693
I think we should rule out
anyone who doesn't live near here.

276
00:32:45,867 --> 00:32:49,911
She's willing to fly anywhere.

277
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:56,283
Looks like my third-grade teacher.
She is my third-grade teacher!

278
00:32:57,045 --> 00:33:01,872
- Don't you want to read these?
- No. it's not how it's done.

279
00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:06,297
I'd rather see somebody I like.

280
00:33:06,471 --> 00:33:11,761
- Then I'd ask her out for a drink.
- Or a slice of pizza.

281
00:33:11,935 --> 00:33:17,605
No dinner on the first date. because
halfway through you could regret it.

282
00:33:17,774 --> 00:33:22,068
But if you like them after a drink,
you can always ask them to dinner.

283
00:33:22,237 --> 00:33:26,365
If not, you can say,
"That was great," and go home.

284
00:33:26,532 --> 00:33:31,693
You see? I wonder
if it still works this way.

285
00:33:31,871 --> 00:33:36,083
- It doesn't. They ask you.
- I'm starting to notice that.

286
00:33:36,251 --> 00:33:40,747
If you get a new wife,
you'll have sex with her, huh?

287
00:33:40,922 --> 00:33:47,126
- I certainly hope so.
- Will she scratch up your back?

288
00:33:47,303 --> 00:33:52,724
In movies women always scratch the
man's back and scream during sex.

289
00:33:52,892 --> 00:33:58,516
- How do you know this?
- Jed's got cable.

290
00:33:59,816 --> 00:34:03,399
Hand me that towel, please.

291
00:34:07,073 --> 00:34:12,862
Thank you. Let me get you.
"Jed's got cable!"

292
00:35:40,959 --> 00:35:46,498
Now to Dr. Fieldstone, psychologist
and the friend you never have.

293
00:35:46,673 --> 00:35:50,717
- Remember Marooned in Miami?
- He doesn't love me anymore.

294
00:35:50,885 --> 00:35:55,464
- Then why stay with him?
- Disappointed in Denver.

295
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:59,887
When I come close to orgasm,
he goes to make a sandwich.

296
00:36:00,061 --> 00:36:04,059
- Make a sandwich beforehand.
- Sleepless in Seattle.

297
00:36:04,232 --> 00:36:12,488
I'll get up every morning
and breathe all day long.

298
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:17,778
After a while I won't have to
remind myself-

299
00:36:17,954 --> 00:36:22,532
- to get up and breathe in and out.

300
00:36:24,419 --> 00:36:29,377
Then after a while I won't
have to think about-

301
00:36:29,549 --> 00:36:33,712
- howl had it great and perfect
for a while.

302
00:36:33,887 --> 00:36:37,386
Why was your wife so special?

303
00:36:38,266 --> 00:36:42,975
How long is your program?

304
00:36:43,146 --> 00:36:49,065
It was a million little things.

305
00:36:49,235 --> 00:36:53,862
When you added them up, it meant
we were meant for each other.

306
00:36:54,032 --> 00:36:58,741
I knew it,
the first time I touched her.

307
00:36:58,912 --> 00:37:04,333
It was like coming home,
only to no home I'd ever known.

308
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:10,705
I was just taking her hand
to help her out of a car.

309
00:37:10,882 --> 00:37:16,089
And I knew it.
It was like ...

310
00:37:16,262 --> 00:37:19,880
... magic.

311
00:37:39,452 --> 00:37:43,995
I think I'm going crazy, Dennis.
Are you happily married?

312
00:37:44,165 --> 00:37:48,993
Why did you get married?
Was it trumpets and fireworks?

313
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:54,046
Betsy said we had to break up
or get married. That's why.

314
00:37:54,926 --> 00:37:59,089
When you met, did you think
she was the only one for you?

315
00:37:59,264 --> 00:38:02,383
That in some way it was fated?

316
00:38:02,559 --> 00:38:06,343
Annie. attraction is -

317
00:38:06,521 --> 00:38:11,562
- when your subconscious is
attracted to their subconscious.

318
00:38:11,734 --> 00:38:16,895
Fate is to neuroses
knowing they're a perfect match.

319
00:38:17,073 --> 00:38:23,194
I'm having all these fantasies
about a man I never even met!

320
00:38:23,371 --> 00:38:27,499
- And he lives in Seattle!
- It rains nine months a year there.

321
00:38:27,667 --> 00:38:32,662
I know. I won't move to Seattle.

322
00:38:35,466 --> 00:38:41,836
But I don't want to end up wondering
what might have happened.

323
00:38:42,015 --> 00:38:46,760
What do you think?
It's cold feet. isn't it?

324
00:38:46,936 --> 00:38:51,432
- Everybody panics. Didn't you?
- Yes. I did.

325
00:38:51,608 --> 00:38:57,361
Thanks. Dennis. I feel better now.

326
00:38:57,947 --> 00:39:03,404
Sandy's friend is a weightlifter,
but her neck isn't that big.

327
00:39:03,578 --> 00:39:10,660
No, don't set me up. I want to know
what it's like out there.

328
00:39:10,835 --> 00:39:15,912
Women are looking
for pecs and a cute butt.

329
00:39:16,090 --> 00:39:20,302
"He has the cutest butt."
Where did I hear that recently?

330
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:27,219
Everywhere. Even on the news
women talk about cute butts.

331
00:39:27,393 --> 00:39:30,845
It's really caught on.

332
00:39:31,022 --> 00:39:34,557
So how's my butt?

333
00:39:35,693 --> 00:39:39,027
- Not bad.
- Is it cute though?

334
00:39:39,197 --> 00:39:41,604
Are we grading on a curve?

335
00:39:42,825 --> 00:39:47,203
When was your last date?

336
00:39:48,539 --> 00:39:52,489
Jimmy Carter ... 1978.

337
00:39:52,669 --> 00:39:58,422
Things are different now.
First you have to be friends.

338
00:39:58,591 --> 00:40:02,423
Then you neck.
This could go on for years.

339
00:40:02,595 --> 00:40:07,138
Then you have tests and do it with a
condom. But you do split the check.

340
00:40:08,059 --> 00:40:13,136
- I can't let a woman pay.
- They'll throw a parade for you.

341
00:40:13,314 --> 00:40:17,478
You'll be Man of the Year.

342
00:40:17,652 --> 00:40:22,693
Tira misu.
You'll find out what that is.

343
00:40:22,865 --> 00:40:27,278
Some woman will want me to do it
to her. and I won't know what it is.

344
00:40:27,453 --> 00:40:34,583
- You'll love it.
- This is going to be tough.

345
00:40:34,752 --> 00:40:41,206
What about that decorator?
She's perky.

346
00:40:41,384 --> 00:40:47,885
No. I'm far away from that.
I'm just making notes.

347
00:40:48,057 --> 00:40:53,218
- How would I do it?
- Ask her over to look at swatches.

348
00:40:53,396 --> 00:40:58,307
- To look at swatches?
- Yeah. colour schemes.

349
00:40:58,484 --> 00:41:04,274
Don't do it like I did. Be suave.
Think Cary Grant.

350
00:41:04,449 --> 00:41:08,696
Would he say,
"Come look at my swatches"?

351
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:13,828
- Not it in movies ...
- Not in "Gunga Din"?

352
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,543
"Gunga Din" isn't that kind of film.
Who knows what he did in real life.

353
00:41:18,713 --> 00:41:24,052
- He did that with Dyan Cannon?
- "Dyan, look at these swatches."

354
00:41:42,654 --> 00:41:45,227
Jonah. I'm home!

355
00:41:47,951 --> 00:41:50,442
Jonah?

356
00:42:08,471 --> 00:42:11,757
Hi. Dad. This is Jessica.

357
00:42:11,933 --> 00:42:15,266
Nice to meet you.

358
00:42:15,436 --> 00:42:20,394
This is amazing. If you play this
backwards, it says "Paul is dead."

359
00:42:20,567 --> 00:42:26,106
- Yeah. I know.
- How do you know?

360
00:42:27,115 --> 00:42:31,777
- Dad, could you shut the door?
- Sure.

361
00:42:31,953 --> 00:42:37,707
H and G.
Hi and goodbye.

362
00:43:50,448 --> 00:43:53,402
Hello. Victoria?

363
00:43:53,576 --> 00:43:59,033
This is Sam Baldwin.
I don't know if you remember me ...

364
00:43:59,207 --> 00:44:03,157
Oh, great.

365
00:44:03,336 --> 00:44:10,169
I was wondering if you would like
to have a drink with me?

366
00:44:10,343 --> 00:44:12,799
Dinner?

367
00:44:12,971 --> 00:44:16,636
Dinner would be even better.

368
00:44:16,808 --> 00:44:20,259
Friday would be great.

369
00:44:20,436 --> 00:44:24,137
I hear that's a good place.

370
00:44:25,358 --> 00:44:29,984
Seven-thirty is fine. And I'll ...

371
00:44:31,948 --> 00:44:36,076
Okay, I'll meet you there.

372
00:44:36,244 --> 00:44:42,697
So it's Friday
at seven-thirty for dinner. Great.

373
00:44:44,335 --> 00:44:47,835
Me, too. Bye.

374
00:44:53,177 --> 00:44:59,595
- Are you in love with him?
- Not now.

375
00:44:59,767 --> 00:45:05,687
- Those people knew how to love.
- You're a basket case.

376
00:45:05,857 --> 00:45:12,109
They knew it. Nothing could
separate them because they knew.

377
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:15,863
- It was real.
- It's a movie.

378
00:45:16,034 --> 00:45:21,704
You don't want to be in love.
you want to be in a movie. Read it.

379
00:45:22,832 --> 00:45:27,161
"Dear Sleepless and Son. I've never
written a letter like this before."

380
00:45:27,337 --> 00:45:33,007
- That's what everyone writes.
- You think I don't know that?

381
00:45:33,843 --> 00:45:36,797
What about Walter?

382
00:45:36,971 --> 00:45:40,969
I'd give anything to marry Walter.

383
00:45:41,142 --> 00:45:47,346
He's so unexpected. You think
you know him, but you don't.

384
00:45:48,191 --> 00:45:51,275
I should write about magic.

385
00:45:51,444 --> 00:45:56,272
What if this man is my destiny,
and I never meet him?

386
00:45:56,449 --> 00:46:01,158
- Your destiny can be your doom.
- "I want to meet you ..."

387
00:46:01,329 --> 00:46:06,240
- At the Empire State Building.
- At the Empire State Building.

388
00:46:06,417 --> 00:46:09,952
Sunset, Valentine's Day.

389
00:46:10,129 --> 00:46:14,258
I'll be in New York with Walter.
I can squeeze it in.

390
00:46:14,425 --> 00:46:18,209
I'll be in New York with Walter!

391
00:46:24,352 --> 00:46:30,188
Because of fate I married Martin and
bought the house with the dead tree.

392
00:46:30,358 --> 00:46:34,605
On account of which I got divorced
and hit a car -

393
00:46:34,779 --> 00:46:38,195
- and met Rick.
while buying a neck brace.

394
00:46:38,366 --> 00:46:41,984
You got divorced because of a tree?

395
00:46:42,161 --> 00:46:45,577
- The tree man.
- You fell in love with him?

396
00:46:45,748 --> 00:46:51,787
I did not say love.
This is my favourite part.

397
00:46:52,922 --> 00:46:59,257
- It's now or never.
- Never is a frightening word.

398
00:46:59,429 --> 00:47:03,972
We'd be fools to let
happiness pass us by.

399
00:47:05,184 --> 00:47:10,309
Winter must be cold
for those with no warm memories.

400
00:47:11,608 --> 00:47:15,652
We've already missed the spring.

401
00:47:16,738 --> 00:47:21,779
- Men never get this movie.
- I know.

402
00:47:22,785 --> 00:47:25,537
Mummy! Mummy!

403
00:47:27,790 --> 00:47:34,540
- Mummy!
- It's okay. I'm here. I'm coming.

404
00:47:36,549 --> 00:47:40,713
It's okay. What was that about?

405
00:47:40,887 --> 00:47:46,391
Our house was sinking. There was
water coming in all the windows.

406
00:47:47,977 --> 00:47:52,723
Well, it's okay now.

407
00:47:53,858 --> 00:48:00,062
What shall we do? Your mother sang
to when you had bad dreams.

408
00:48:00,990 --> 00:48:04,774
"Bye Bye Blackbird".

409
00:48:06,329 --> 00:48:11,406
I miss her. What happens
to someone after they die?

410
00:48:12,919 --> 00:48:17,830
- I don't know.
- Do you believe in heaven?

411
00:48:20,134 --> 00:48:26,884
I never believed in an afterlife.
But now. I don't know.

412
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:33,970
Because I've had these dreams
about your mum.

413
00:48:35,066 --> 00:48:40,191
We have long talks ... about you.

414
00:48:40,363 --> 00:48:46,651
How you're doing. She sort of
knows, but I tell her anyway.

415
00:48:46,828 --> 00:48:53,281
So what is that?
It's sort of an afterlife. isn't it?

416
00:48:54,335 --> 00:48:59,163
I'm starting to forget her.

417
00:49:12,353 --> 00:49:17,229
She could peel an apple -

418
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:22,643
- in one long, curly strip.

419
00:49:23,865 --> 00:49:27,993
The whole apple.

420
00:49:38,046 --> 00:49:43,420
- I love you, Jonah.
- I love you, Dad.

421
00:49:49,474 --> 00:49:52,558
See you tomorrow.

422
00:51:04,924 --> 00:51:10,760
Laurie? It's Annie.
I'm fine.

423
00:51:10,930 --> 00:51:18,226
I'm writing about radio shows.
Do you know Dr. Fieldstone?

424
00:51:18,396 --> 00:51:24,232
I work for the Baltimore Sun. and
I'm doing a piece on bereavement.

425
00:51:24,402 --> 00:51:28,352
I understand
you had a caller from Seattle ...

426
00:51:36,623 --> 00:51:41,664
This is 'Jonah Baldwin.
We're not in right now...

427
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:47,940
Architect.

428
00:53:19,893 --> 00:53:26,310
I'll be back either by midnight
or 8:30. if disaster strikes.

429
00:53:26,482 --> 00:53:30,895
- Here's one for both of us.
- "Sleepless and Son, Baltimore."

430
00:53:31,070 --> 00:53:34,605
Here's the doctor's number.

431
00:53:34,782 --> 00:53:39,859
Here's a bottle of ipecac
if anybody drinks poison.

432
00:53:40,038 --> 00:53:44,949
How do I look?
Do I look all right?

433
00:53:45,126 --> 00:53:50,631
I look stupid. I'm trying too hard.
I was going to get a haircut.

434
00:53:50,798 --> 00:53:55,591
- This is a good letter, Dad.
- These heels are grotesque.

435
00:53:55,762 --> 00:53:58,798
Her name is Annie Reed.

436
00:53:58,973 --> 00:54:02,508
Dad. read this.

437
00:54:04,145 --> 00:54:08,225
"Dear Sleepless and Son ..."

438
00:54:08,399 --> 00:54:13,026
"I'm an excellent third baseman.
and let me tell you, -

439
00:54:13,196 --> 00:54:18,024
- Robinson was the best. We must
agree on this. I'm from Baltimore."

440
00:54:18,201 --> 00:54:23,444
She likes Brooks Robinson.
So do you. It's a sign.

441
00:54:23,623 --> 00:54:28,249
Come here. I'll show you a sign.

442
00:54:30,964 --> 00:54:37,251
Where's Seattle?
And Baltimore? Right there!

443
00:54:37,428 --> 00:54:42,671
There's like 26 states between
here and there. That's a sign.

444
00:54:42,850 --> 00:54:47,892
I'm out of here. Goodbye.
I love you.

445
00:54:50,817 --> 00:54:55,360
Clarise, did you move your car?

446
00:55:02,912 --> 00:55:07,989
- Thanks. Derrick. I'll have ...
- White wine spritzer?

447
00:55:08,167 --> 00:55:11,583
- And you, sir?
- I'm fine.

448
00:55:11,754 --> 00:55:16,749
- You look good.
- So do you.

449
00:55:19,971 --> 00:55:23,091
I thought you'd never call me.

450
00:55:23,266 --> 00:55:26,551
I really wanted you to.

451
00:55:26,728 --> 00:55:32,600
Mr. Baldwin, phone call for you.

452
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:44,531
Dad, can we go to New York
for Valentine's Day?

453
00:55:44,704 --> 00:55:50,707
Annie Reed wants to meet us at the
top of the Empire State Building.

454
00:55:50,877 --> 00:55:57,876
Jonah, have you fallen down?
Has Clarise been strangled?

455
00:55:58,051 --> 00:56:01,135
- No.
- Is that the reason you're calling?

456
00:56:01,304 --> 00:56:06,643
We can get cheap tickets
from Jessica's parents.

457
00:56:06,809 --> 00:56:11,056
We'll talk about it later.

458
00:56:11,231 --> 00:56:16,391
This conversation has lasted
too long. Go to bed.

459
00:56:22,033 --> 00:56:26,410
- Everything all right?
- Yes. Do you have kids?

460
00:56:26,579 --> 00:56:29,782
You want mine?

461
00:56:30,667 --> 00:56:34,914
I'll have an Absolut straight up.

462
00:56:51,563 --> 00:56:55,228
Put that down. Stop it!

463
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:59,528
- There she is.
- Why is she bringing groceries?

464
00:56:59,696 --> 00:57:04,773
- She's going to cook for us.
- Hi. Sam.

465
00:57:04,951 --> 00:57:08,996
Let me guess. You must be Jonah.

466
00:57:11,874 --> 00:57:16,335
This is it? The car is this way.

467
00:57:16,504 --> 00:57:23,420
She's on her sixth painter. And now
she wants the fireplace rebricked.

468
00:57:23,595 --> 00:57:30,131
- I know her. I could call her.
- I'll just hit her with a brick.

469
00:57:32,645 --> 00:57:35,682
That's so funny. You're so funny.

470
00:57:35,857 --> 00:57:41,895
When she wants something done
she says: "You know best."

471
00:57:42,071 --> 00:57:47,314
"But couldn't we flip the house
so the back is in front?"

472
00:57:47,493 --> 00:57:53,579
"Put the front on a hinge so I can
get in with a garage door opener."

473
00:57:53,750 --> 00:58:00,037
- "Yes, we can. We'll just ..."
- "Move the cabinets."

474
00:58:07,222 --> 00:58:10,970
Jonah, bring some of that stuff.

475
00:58:11,142 --> 00:58:14,178
Do you like baseball?

476
00:58:14,354 --> 00:58:19,265
Yes. In fact my firm has box seats
to the Mariners. Let's go some day.

477
00:58:20,985 --> 00:58:25,813
What about camping?
Do you like that?

478
00:58:25,990 --> 00:58:28,777
I went camping once.

479
00:58:28,952 --> 00:58:34,705
- We should go camping more often.
- You're right. Time for bed.

480
00:58:34,874 --> 00:58:39,453
- It's only 10:00.
- That's right. Time for bed.

481
00:58:39,629 --> 00:58:42,630
Goodnight.

482
00:58:44,259 --> 00:58:48,256
Thank Victoria for the nice dinner.

483
00:58:48,429 --> 00:58:53,506
Thanks for dinner. I never saw
anybody cook potatoes that way.

484
00:58:53,685 --> 00:58:59,438
I'm glad you liked it.
Goodnight, Jonah.

485
00:59:00,733 --> 00:59:06,688
We don't see a lot of potatoes here.
We're rice men.

486
01:00:00,210 --> 01:00:03,460
I'm sorry, Walter. I'm sorry.

487
01:00:08,176 --> 01:00:10,797
Turn on your radio.

488
01:00:10,970 --> 01:00:15,965
The kid is on. You've got me
listening to this garbage!

489
01:00:16,893 --> 01:00:23,975
Becky's having trouble with Rick.
Becky, I'll call you back.

490
01:00:26,819 --> 01:00:31,316
I'm sorry, Walter.
Are you bleeding?

491
01:00:50,510 --> 01:00:53,677
He's kissing her right now!

492
01:00:53,846 --> 01:00:57,630
Are you spying on your father?.

493
01:00:57,809 --> 01:01:02,850
- Who is he kissing?
- I have to make them stop.

494
01:01:03,022 --> 01:01:07,150
- How will I explain this to Walter?
- She made dinner.

495
01:01:07,318 --> 01:01:10,521
She brought food for a whole year!

496
01:01:10,697 --> 01:01:15,193
It's good that your father's dating.
It's just hard on you.

497
01:01:15,368 --> 01:01:19,745
You think you want it,
but when it happens, it scares you.

498
01:01:19,914 --> 01:01:25,371
Shouldn't your father decide
whether someone is right for him?

499
01:01:25,545 --> 01:01:27,834
He's not sane enough.

500
01:01:28,006 --> 01:01:33,878
He's kissing her on the lips.
My dad's been captured by a 'ho!

501
01:01:34,053 --> 01:01:38,762
Calm down. Tomorrow,
when you're having breakfast, -

502
01:01:38,933 --> 01:01:44,806
- tell him how you feel.
Don't keep it inside.

503
01:01:49,360 --> 01:01:53,939
Miss Scarlett. In the broom closet.
With the radio.

504
01:01:54,115 --> 01:01:59,655
Walter, you scared me.
Don't ever do that again.

505
01:02:02,540 --> 01:02:07,286
- I saw a black widow.
- You scared me and Victoria.

506
01:02:07,462 --> 01:02:12,420
- It was right there.
- Next time I want you to say:

507
01:02:12,592 --> 01:02:16,886
"Dad, I see a poisonous insect."

508
01:02:17,055 --> 01:02:20,506
And I'll deal with it. Don't scream.

509
01:02:20,683 --> 01:02:25,179
Becky thought Rick was on the radio.

510
01:02:25,355 --> 01:02:31,274
It turned out the guy lived
in Duluth. Where's Duluth?

511
01:02:31,444 --> 01:02:35,905
- That doesn't make any sense.
- I know. No sense at all.

512
01:02:36,074 --> 01:02:41,779
- Thank God my life is in place.
- Duluth? That's in North Dakota.

513
01:02:56,135 --> 01:03:01,047
- Great letter. Write to her.
- You think so?

514
01:03:01,224 --> 01:03:06,728
It's Y-O-H.
Your only hope.

515
01:03:18,449 --> 01:03:23,870
I thought I'd do a story
on those radio shows.

516
01:03:24,038 --> 01:03:28,665
- You'd have to go somewhere.
- Definitely.

517
01:03:47,562 --> 01:03:51,939
- Can't you do a phone interview?
- No.

518
01:03:52,108 --> 01:03:56,402
- I won't be in Chicago long.
- When you get back, I'll be gone.

519
01:03:56,571 --> 01:04:00,699
- Then I'll see you in New York.
- I'll get it ...

520
01:04:04,871 --> 01:04:09,948
This is Captain Browning.
We're cruising at 35,000 feet.

521
01:04:10,126 --> 01:04:15,583
The weather is clear
and we'll be in Seattle on schedule.

522
01:04:15,757 --> 01:04:23,633
- Don't you hate flying?
- Yes. and I've told a terrible lie.

523
01:04:23,806 --> 01:04:27,756
Is any lie a betrayal?

524
01:04:27,936 --> 01:04:32,265
I said flying.

525
01:04:37,445 --> 01:04:41,858
- Thanks for bringing me here.
- He likes the planes.

526
01:04:42,033 --> 01:04:48,830
Can I bring you back a souvenir?
Maybe one of these snow globes?

527
01:04:48,998 --> 01:04:53,826
Sure, I'd really like that.
Thank you so much.

528
01:04:55,255 --> 01:04:58,873
- He's eight.
- He's good at it.

529
01:04:59,050 --> 01:05:04,092
I've read an article about it.
Children are hideous at that age.

530
01:05:04,264 --> 01:05:11,227
Maybe when I come back, the to of
us ought to spend some time alone.

531
01:05:15,733 --> 01:05:18,853
Bye. Bye, Jonah.

532
01:05:24,117 --> 01:05:26,323
Jonah.

533
01:05:26,494 --> 01:05:29,993
Listen, you don't know Victoria.

534
01:05:30,164 --> 01:05:35,289
In fact she's a mystery to me, too.

535
01:05:35,461 --> 01:05:39,506
She tosses her hair a lot. Why?

536
01:05:39,674 --> 01:05:44,669
Is it a titch? Does she need
a haircut or a barrette?

537
01:05:46,306 --> 01:05:53,720
I'd like to understand these things.
And that's why I'm dating her.

538
01:05:53,897 --> 01:05:59,271
Just dating. I'm not living
with her. I'm not marrying her.

539
01:05:59,444 --> 01:06:02,979
Can you appreciate the difference?

540
01:06:03,156 --> 01:06:07,782
That's what single people do.
They see how other people fit.

541
01:06:07,952 --> 01:06:14,536
Everyone's an adjustment. There's
no such thing as a perfect ...

542
01:06:29,891 --> 01:06:33,474
Come on.

543
01:06:34,020 --> 01:06:40,604
Dad, Jessica says
you knew Annie in another life.

544
01:06:40,777 --> 01:06:45,569
The one who wrote us. But you
never got together in that life.

545
01:06:45,740 --> 01:06:51,659
Your hearts will be a complete
puzzle once you're together.

546
01:06:51,829 --> 01:06:58,662
I know that because I'm young and
pure, in touch with cosmic forces.

547
01:06:58,836 --> 01:07:04,376
Who told you that? I sure hope
you're not marrying Jessica.

548
01:09:48,047 --> 01:09:52,875
- I watched them play at the beach.
- Did you talk to him?

549
01:09:53,052 --> 01:09:56,635
Couldn't do it.

550
01:09:56,806 --> 01:10:02,512
- How did I get here?
- You lied and got on a plane.

551
01:10:03,771 --> 01:10:11,103
- I'm going to talk to him tomorrow.
- Okay. Good. Goodbye.

552
01:10:11,279 --> 01:10:14,695
Beck ...

553
01:10:15,366 --> 01:10:21,202
- Is this crazy?
- No, that's the weirdest part

554
01:10:21,372 --> 01:10:27,493
- Thank you. I love you.
- I love you, too.

555
01:11:29,899 --> 01:11:34,193
It's good to see you. Where's Greg?

556
01:11:57,093 --> 01:12:01,173
Hello.

557
01:12:07,854 --> 01:12:12,231
- Then what?
- I left, obviously.

558
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:18,154
- You were in the street?
- It was like walking around naked.

559
01:12:18,323 --> 01:12:23,993
- I love that dream.
- This was more humiliating.

560
01:12:24,162 --> 01:12:28,206
But he saw you.
You were face to face.

561
01:12:28,374 --> 01:12:35,207
He said hello.
And all I could say was hello.

562
01:12:36,132 --> 01:12:41,719
- All I could say was hello.
- It's a sign.

563
01:12:41,888 --> 01:12:47,013
It's a sign that I've watched
this movie too many times.

564
01:12:47,185 --> 01:12:53,804
From the minute I heard that program
I've been a complete jerk.

565
01:12:53,983 --> 01:12:57,851
- You're not a jerk.
- Thank you. An idiot!

566
01:12:58,029 --> 01:13:03,783
- You don't know who she was.
- I have a picture of her.

567
01:13:03,952 --> 01:13:10,286
The detective sent it to me.
See. that's what she looks like.

568
01:13:11,167 --> 01:13:16,292
- It's her back.
- It's her and he's crazy about her.

569
01:13:16,464 --> 01:13:21,375
What's this?
It's from Seattle.

570
01:13:28,434 --> 01:13:31,139
Becky.

571
01:13:32,230 --> 01:13:35,681
So I mailed your letter ...

572
01:13:36,401 --> 01:13:42,439
"Dear Annie. Thanks for your letter.
You sound neat."

573
01:13:45,743 --> 01:13:50,904
"We're excited about meeting you
in New York, and seeing if we're ...

574
01:13:51,082 --> 01:13:55,543
... M-F-E-O."

575
01:13:55,712 --> 01:13:59,923
"See you soon.
Sleepless in Seattle."

576
01:14:00,091 --> 01:14:04,136
M-F-E-O?

577
01:14:05,930 --> 01:14:09,548
Made for each other.

578
01:14:09,726 --> 01:14:12,892
It's cute. Like a little clue.

579
01:14:17,483 --> 01:14:20,852
So he can't write. Big deal.

580
01:14:21,029 --> 01:14:26,699
Verbal ability is overrated in guys.
Our need for it leads to trouble.

581
01:14:26,868 --> 01:14:31,909
- I'm going to run back to Walter.
- And the letter?

582
01:14:32,081 --> 01:14:36,874
It was written before I went
out there. Before the 'ho.

583
01:14:39,505 --> 01:14:46,504
But she didn't look like a 'ho.
She looked like one of our friends.

584
01:14:50,225 --> 01:14:56,014
- You saw her in the airport, too?
- It was like I knew her.

585
01:14:56,189 --> 01:15:01,610
- Like a deja-vu?
- It was very deja-vu-ish.

586
01:15:01,778 --> 01:15:07,448
- At least you're seeing people.
- Well, only one ...

587
01:15:07,617 --> 01:15:11,745
- Victoria.
- You don't like her?

588
01:15:11,913 --> 01:15:17,204
- She laughs like a hyena.
- Is this true?

589
01:15:17,377 --> 01:15:21,540
Sort of. Tell them what you did.

590
01:15:21,714 --> 01:15:24,964
Tell them about the radio show.

591
01:15:25,134 --> 01:15:28,883
Christmas Eve he calls a radio show.

592
01:15:29,055 --> 01:15:35,936
- And tells them I need a new wife.
- That's so sweet.

593
01:15:36,104 --> 01:15:40,184
Now he's obsessed with
a woman who wrote me.

594
01:15:40,358 --> 01:15:45,565
She wants to meet me on top of
Empire State on Valentines Day.

595
01:15:45,738 --> 01:15:51,362
It's like that movie.
"An Affair to Remember".

596
01:15:51,536 --> 01:15:56,613
Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr.
Is that "car" or "cur"?

597
01:15:59,961 --> 01:16:05,715
They were to meet at the Empire
State, but she got hit by a taxi.

598
01:16:05,884 --> 01:16:10,759
He waited and waited.
And it was raining.

599
01:16:10,930 --> 01:16:17,384
Then she's too proud
to tell him that she's ...

600
01:16:19,772 --> 01:16:25,645
... crippled. And he's too proud
to find out why she doesn't come.

601
01:16:25,820 --> 01:16:29,688
But he comes to see her anyway.

602
01:16:29,866 --> 01:16:34,575
It's amazing when he visits her.

603
01:16:34,746 --> 01:16:39,455
He doesn't notice that she
doesn't get up to say hello.

604
01:16:39,626 --> 01:16:42,876
And he's very bitter.

605
01:16:43,046 --> 01:16:47,921
You think he's going to walk out
and never know why.

606
01:16:48,092 --> 01:16:56,302
She's just lying there with
a blanket over her shriveled legs.

607
01:16:58,394 --> 01:17:01,598
- Are you all right?
- She's fine.

608
01:17:01,773 --> 01:17:08,226
The he says, "I saw the painting,"
and goes into the bedroom.

609
01:17:08,404 --> 01:17:12,354
And he comes out and looks at her.

610
01:17:12,533 --> 01:17:17,030
And they just know
and hug and it's so ...

611
01:17:17,205 --> 01:17:20,823
- That's a chick's movie.
- I'd say so.

612
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:26,873
- Who'd write a guy from the radio?
- I got hundreds of letters.

613
01:17:27,048 --> 01:17:31,757
- Desperate women.
- Is wanting a nice guy desperate?

614
01:17:31,928 --> 01:17:37,384
It's easier to be killed
by terrorists than to marry over 40.

615
01:17:37,559 --> 01:17:41,971
- That is not true!
- Right, honey.

616
01:17:42,146 --> 01:17:47,603
I don't want a mail-order bride.
Just someone who can converse -

617
01:17:47,777 --> 01:17:53,613
- without falling into
weepy tears over an old movie.

618
01:17:53,783 --> 01:17:59,821
I cried over "The Dirty Dozen".
Jim Brown throwing the grenades.

619
01:17:59,998 --> 01:18:05,621
Richard Jaeckel and Lee Marvin
on top of a tank dressed like nazis.

620
01:18:07,338 --> 01:18:14,337
Trini Lopez ... breaks his neck
when they're parachuting.

621
01:18:14,512 --> 01:18:19,340
Richard Jaeckel had on a shiny
helmet. because he was an MP.

622
01:18:19,517 --> 01:18:24,263
Please. no more.
God. I love that movie.

623
01:18:32,655 --> 01:18:37,364
- This is the best movie I ever saw.
- What's so great about it?

624
01:18:37,535 --> 01:18:42,197
- You have to find her.
- How much would it cost to go?

625
01:18:42,373 --> 01:18:47,035
Nobody knows.
It changes practically every day.

626
01:18:47,212 --> 01:18:50,497
- How much money do you have?
- 80 dollars.

627
01:18:50,673 --> 01:18:56,676
- I have 42. That'll cover cabs.
- How would I get there?

628
01:18:56,846 --> 01:19:02,600
I have to drop these tickets off.
Can you keep an eye on things?

629
01:19:12,946 --> 01:19:16,231
- Window seat or aisle?
- Window.

630
01:19:16,407 --> 01:19:21,200
You want a fruit plate? I'd rather
die than eat airplane food.

631
01:19:21,371 --> 01:19:25,665
I'll write you're 12.
That way you can fly unaccompanied.

632
01:19:25,833 --> 01:19:32,417
- Who'd believe I'm 12?
- They'll believe the computer.

633
01:19:32,590 --> 01:19:38,047
I'll say you're short for your age,
but that they shouldn't mention it.

634
01:19:38,221 --> 01:19:40,463
Great idea!

635
01:20:00,743 --> 01:20:04,611
- You'll miss the train.
- No I won't.

636
01:20:04,789 --> 01:20:10,294
I'm so happy, Becky.
This is right. It's real.

637
01:20:10,461 --> 01:20:15,622
The other things happen in movies.

638
01:20:15,800 --> 01:20:19,845
Don't tell anyone what I did.
I'd die -

639
01:20:20,013 --> 01:20:26,431
- if anyone knew I did anything
like that. You promise?

640
01:20:26,603 --> 01:20:30,850
Sleepless in Seattle is history.

641
01:21:03,264 --> 01:21:06,467
- Go ahead.
- No, you go.

642
01:21:06,643 --> 01:21:10,890
I was going to say
that since Christmas -

643
01:21:11,064 --> 01:21:15,013
- you've been kind of distracted.

644
01:21:15,193 --> 01:21:21,480
But now it feels as if you're coming
back from wherever you were.

645
01:21:21,658 --> 01:21:24,943
I am.

646
01:21:25,119 --> 01:21:31,158
I was just ...
I think I got nervous.

647
01:21:31,876 --> 01:21:38,757
But that's normal, right?
Don't you ever feel nervous ...

648
01:21:39,926 --> 01:21:44,884
- About what?
- Forever.

649
01:21:45,557 --> 01:21:48,723
No.

650
01:21:50,436 --> 01:21:55,182
Well ... I did.

651
01:21:55,358 --> 01:22:00,649
And I think I thought
it was too perfect.

652
01:22:00,822 --> 01:22:06,527
I was afraid we'd be to rights
making a wrong.

653
01:22:06,703 --> 01:22:13,500
You know. it was like kismet.
but not, if you see what I mean.

654
01:22:13,668 --> 01:22:18,663
You have to grow up and forget
the adolescent fantasies about -

655
01:22:18,840 --> 01:22:23,383
- how exciting life will be.
I'm sorry, but I love this pattern.

656
01:22:23,553 --> 01:22:28,298
You couldn't. This is just
like my grandmother's china.

657
01:22:28,474 --> 01:22:32,971
- How many place settings?
- Ten.

658
01:22:35,064 --> 01:22:41,731
Exactly. Eight is too few,
twelve is too many.

659
01:23:04,636 --> 01:23:09,179
- Walter ...
- It was my mother's.

660
01:23:10,141 --> 01:23:15,895
I had them size it down.
She had really fat fingers.

661
01:23:18,358 --> 01:23:22,605
It's so beautiful.
It's exactly what I'd pick -

662
01:23:22,779 --> 01:23:28,021
- if I had every ring
in the world to choose from.

663
01:23:29,035 --> 01:23:33,827
Some people want a relationship
to be full of surprises, -

664
01:23:33,998 --> 01:23:38,245
- but I'm not one of them.

665
01:23:38,878 --> 01:23:43,457
Surprises are highly overrated.

666
01:23:44,384 --> 01:23:44,425
I'll only be gone one night.
Clarise will be here ...

667
01:23:44,425 --> 01:23:49,301
I'll only be gone one night.
Clarise will be here ...

668
01:23:49,472 --> 01:23:53,422
You can watch scary movies.

669
01:23:53,601 --> 01:23:58,512
- Are you going with her?
- I'm going with Victoria.

670
01:24:00,858 --> 01:24:04,477
Don't try anything tricky.

671
01:24:06,698 --> 01:24:13,234
Don't roll in poison ivy or
do anything so you need stitches.

672
01:24:13,413 --> 01:24:20,246
If your finger falls off, it stays
off. I won't take you to hospital.

673
01:24:21,170 --> 01:24:25,334
- Is this about that woman?
- Annie.

674
01:24:28,887 --> 01:24:33,216
- I don't care what you do!
- I'll tell you what I'm doing.

675
01:24:33,391 --> 01:24:39,394
I'm getting laid. I'm the only man
in the 90's who's getting laid.

676
01:24:39,564 --> 01:24:45,151
And I haven't been laid that much.
Six or seven girls at college.

677
01:24:45,320 --> 01:24:49,317
How long have you been there?
What did you hear me say?

678
01:24:49,490 --> 01:24:54,947
-"Six-seven girls at college."
- Seven ... Eight! Mary Kelly.

679
01:24:55,121 --> 01:24:59,249
This is the one I like.

680
01:24:59,417 --> 01:25:04,293
Jonah, you won't like any woman,
because it isn't your mother.

681
01:25:04,464 --> 01:25:09,754
- What's wrong with Annie?
- Jonah, shut up.

682
01:25:09,928 --> 01:25:15,930
Shut up? Mum never told me
to shut up or yelled at me.

683
01:25:16,100 --> 01:25:19,018
This conversation is over!

684
01:25:19,187 --> 01:25:25,770
This woman could be a sick lunatic.
Didn't you see "Fatal Attraction"?

685
01:25:25,944 --> 01:25:31,733
- You wouldn't let me.
- It scared every man in America.

686
01:25:33,743 --> 01:25:37,871
I'm not leaving till you say yes.

687
01:25:41,834 --> 01:25:44,076
I hate you!

688
01:25:44,254 --> 01:25:48,203
Good, then you can tell Oprah
how your dad ruined your life -

689
01:25:48,383 --> 01:25:52,546
- by going of for a weekend
special at the Holiday Inn!

690
01:26:07,068 --> 01:26:12,228
Jonah. Clarise is here
and I've got to go.

691
01:26:21,165 --> 01:26:27,002
Jonah. Listen.
I've got to go ...

692
01:26:54,240 --> 01:27:00,243
Jessica. tell us where he is.
Jonah's dad is very upset.

693
01:27:00,413 --> 01:27:05,834
Jessica, this is your father.
Tell us where he is.

694
01:27:07,712 --> 01:27:11,046
- N-Y.
- That means "no way".

695
01:27:11,216 --> 01:27:14,086
That's N-W!

696
01:27:14,260 --> 01:27:19,468
- He's on his way to New York.
- How?

697
01:27:19,641 --> 01:27:22,677
United. 597.

698
01:27:22,852 --> 01:27:26,517
- When does it leave?
- 7:30.

699
01:27:32,445 --> 01:27:36,906
Here's a pin for flying with us.

700
01:27:37,075 --> 01:27:40,859
- Can I take this for you?
- No.

701
01:27:55,218 --> 01:27:59,216
- Where to. kid?
- Empire State Building.

702
01:27:59,389 --> 01:28:03,718
- Empire State Building.
- Don't stop so close to the curb.

703
01:28:05,728 --> 01:28:10,936
There it is. What are you going
to do up there? Spit off the top?

704
01:28:11,109 --> 01:28:14,312
No, I'm meeting my new mother.

705
01:28:34,465 --> 01:28:40,420
- I'm Jonah. Are you Annie?
- No, I'm Cynthia.

706
01:28:46,769 --> 01:28:50,981
Excuse me, are you Annie?

707
01:29:27,810 --> 01:29:30,930
Great table. Thanks.

708
01:29:32,148 --> 01:29:35,019
Is something wrong?

709
01:29:35,193 --> 01:29:39,237
- Can I get you a drink?
- Champagne?

710
01:29:39,405 --> 01:29:41,979
Fine.

711
01:29:42,158 --> 01:29:46,370
We'll have a bottle of Dom DeLuise.

712
01:29:48,748 --> 01:29:53,743
- Just kidding.
- He meant Dom Perignon.

713
01:29:56,005 --> 01:29:59,125
Beautiful view.

714
01:29:59,300 --> 01:30:03,843
Walter ...
There's something I must tell you.

715
01:30:18,486 --> 01:30:21,772
Sorry, an emergency.

716
01:30:21,948 --> 01:30:26,076
Money, money, money, see?

717
01:31:41,486 --> 01:31:46,444
So he could be on top of
the Empire State Building now?

718
01:31:46,616 --> 01:31:52,322
No. I guess he could be ... No.

719
01:31:52,956 --> 01:31:58,958
It's not him. Walter. It's me.
I can't do this.

720
01:32:00,755 --> 01:32:07,552
Annie, I love you.
But let's leave that out of this.

721
01:32:08,513 --> 01:32:15,310
I don't want to be someone that you
or anybody else settles for.

722
01:32:17,313 --> 01:32:22,770
Marriage is hard enough
without such low expectations.

723
01:32:22,944 --> 01:32:27,487
- Isn't it?
- Walter, I don't deserve you.

724
01:32:28,324 --> 01:32:32,192
No, I wouldn't put it that way.

725
01:32:32,370 --> 01:32:36,415
But ... okay.

726
01:32:50,847 --> 01:32:56,719
- You okay?
- Yeah.

727
01:33:00,064 --> 01:33:03,314
- What?
- Look.

728
01:33:10,825 --> 01:33:14,870
- It's a sign.
- Who needed a sign?

729
01:33:15,038 --> 01:33:18,952
Walter, I have to go.

730
01:33:32,013 --> 01:33:35,180
Jonah!

731
01:33:37,810 --> 01:33:40,847
Dad!

732
01:33:54,035 --> 01:33:58,246
What if something happened to you?
What if I couldn't get to you?

733
01:33:58,414 --> 01:34:02,744
I'm sorry.

734
01:34:03,378 --> 01:34:08,799
What would I have done?
You're my family. You're all I have.

735
01:34:08,967 --> 01:34:11,588
I thought she'd be here.

736
01:34:11,761 --> 01:34:16,921
We're doing okay, right?
So far, have I done anything stupid?

737
01:34:17,100 --> 01:34:22,094
- Have I screwed it up for us?
- No.

738
01:35:13,323 --> 01:35:17,901
- Observation deck?
- Sorry, it's too late.

739
01:35:18,077 --> 01:35:23,617
- Please. I need to get up there.
- We're closing up.

740
01:35:28,379 --> 01:35:34,382
Can I just take a look?
I'm supposed to meet someone.

741
01:35:34,552 --> 01:35:39,547
He's probably not there, but if
I don't look, I'll always wonder.

742
01:35:39,724 --> 01:35:43,936
- Cary Grant, right?
- You know that movie?

743
01:35:44,103 --> 01:35:48,053
It's one of my wife's favourites.

744
01:35:54,989 --> 01:35:59,568
Maybe when we get home
we'll get a dog.

745
01:35:59,744 --> 01:36:05,533
- Wouldn't you like to have a dog?
- Sure.

746
01:36:17,428 --> 01:36:21,722
I'm sorry, ma'am. Empty.

747
01:36:22,642 --> 01:36:28,063
- Can I take a minute?
- Go ahead.

748
01:37:40,970 --> 01:37:44,838
I left it by the telescopes.

749
01:38:09,958 --> 01:38:15,628
It's you.
I saw you in the street.

750
01:38:15,797 --> 01:38:20,126
- Are you Annie?
- Yes.

751
01:38:22,929 --> 01:38:26,464
You're Annie?

752
01:38:27,475 --> 01:38:31,639
- This must be yours.
- I'm Jonah.

753
01:38:31,813 --> 01:38:36,724
- This is my dad. His name is Sam.
- Hi. Jonah.

754
01:38:37,735 --> 01:38:40,606
Sam ...

755
01:38:43,783 --> 01:38:48,825
- And who's this?
- Howard.

756
01:39:04,262 --> 01:39:07,880
We'd better go.

757
01:39:13,104 --> 01:39:16,140
Shall we?

758
01:40:01,569 --> 01:40:05,899
Sam ... It's nice to meet you.
