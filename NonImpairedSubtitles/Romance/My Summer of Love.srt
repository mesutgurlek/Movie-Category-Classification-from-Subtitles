Thank you Lord

37
00:05:22,246 --> 00:05:23,976
- Our room is not a Pub

38
00:05:24,326 --> 00:05:26,886
our room is a spiritual center where

39
00:05:27,546 --> 00:05:30,816
people can come and learn
about Jesus Christ -

40
00:05:31,949 --> 00:05:35,679
because we will give
this valley back to Jesus Crist

41
00:05:36,762 --> 00:05:39,461
-Because people live spiritual fullfilment -

42
00:05:39,462 --> 00:05:42,135
They need to know that the
Lord is there for them

43
00:05:42,136 --> 00:05:43,878
-they need an echo of it

44
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:46,089
- They need to know
their Lord -

45
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:48,120
- will you help me do this -

46
00:05:48,563 --> 00:05:50,303
-How great is The Lord -

47
00:05:50,844 --> 00:05:53,364
- We gonna bring love to this
valley

48
00:05:53,365 --> 00:05:56,150
- We gonna bring the name of
Jesus Crist to the
lost people of this valley

49
00:05:56,151 --> 00:05:58,711
-We would let them know
that He is there for them

50
00:05:58,712 --> 00:05:59,522
Thank you -

51

- This was great philosopher

- you know people, there are some people
that are put on this planet

168
00:22:17,508 --> 00:22:19,691
and he comes here
quite a lot, i think -

169
00:22:19,692 --> 00:22:22,792
- cause this is where his girlfriend

170
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:24,971
- and..his secretary..nice -

with his car there -

172
00:22:37,912 --> 00:22:40,762

173
00:22:44,784 --> 00:22:49,314

175
00:22:54,676 --> 00:22:56,935

176
00:22:56,936 --> 00:23:01,416
-and she's also blond hair and

177
00:23:02,419 --> 00:23:06,259
- and she's got no fucking brains
she's got nothing -

178
00:23:41,821 --> 00:23:43,391
- This is Edith Piaf -

179
00:23:45,276 --> 00:23:46,666
-I just adore her -

180
00:23:52,359 --> 00:23:55,229
- She was this marvelous parisien
woman -

181
00:23:55,384 --> 00:23:58,714
- ...and she had such a wonderful
tragic life -

182
00:24:08,861 --> 00:24:11,251
- and she was married three times-

183
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:15,215
- and each husband died
in misterious circumstances -

184
00:24:19,744 --> 00:24:22,149
-and the last one was
a boxing champion -

185
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:24,650
- ..and she killed him
with a fork

186
00:24:29,668 --> 00:24:32,228
- and she not even gone
to prison -

187
00:24:32,498 --> 00:24:36,248
- because in France,
crimes of passion are
forgiven -

188
00:25:51,029 --> 00:25:53,096
-so my mother is off somewhere
with some dodgy company  -

189
00:25:53,097 --> 00:25:54,709
- pretending to be
an actress -

190
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:57,387
- while my father's busy
with his secretary -

191
00:25:57,388 --> 00:25:59,718
- so, i'm practically an orphan -

192
00:26:02,107 --> 00:26:04,398
- this is the main guest
bedroom -

193
00:26:04,399 --> 00:26:07,773
- but it is dirty of dust
because we're not even
have many guests -

194
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:08,704
- excuse me -

195
00:26:09,428 --> 00:26:12,228
- this my noon mother's
rehearsal room-

196
00:26:15,268 --> 00:26:17,488
- this is my favorite bathroom -

197
00:26:19,952 --> 00:26:22,042
- this is Sadie's room -
ohh

198
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:29,075
it's such a turn into
a bedroom of sanctuary

199
00:26:29,076 --> 00:26:30,936
- because when she died
my mother wanted to keep everything-

200
00:26:30,937 --> 00:26:32,447
- exactly as it was -

201
00:26:34,098 --> 00:26:35,538
- you don't go in?-

202
00:26:39,383 --> 00:26:44,913
- oh, and the whole house
is really creepy so you're
going to stay with me -

203
00:26:45,776 --> 00:26:46,476
- common -

204
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:05,921
- if you're hear any strange noises
in the night, don't panic -

205
00:27:05,922 --> 00:27:10,232
- it's just the furniture cricking
cause it's an old house -

206
00:27:12,234 --> 00:27:13,404
- night
-night -

207
00:27:34,812 --> 00:27:36,202

- this is me favorite rock -

216
00:29:44,283 --> 00:29:46,613
- it's like a strange cathedral -

217
00:30:54,388 --> 00:30:56,539
- I don't feel like in
me old town -

218
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:57,760

- you could have that

225
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:31,420
- honest? -

226
00:32:48,484 --> 00:32:50,764
- God, you're looking beautiful -

227
00:33:07,322 --> 00:33:09,062
- It was Sadie's dress -

228
00:33:24,185 --> 00:33:25,695
- I felt so useless -

229
00:33:27,105 --> 00:33:33,935
- You know it was my only sister
my beautiful sister
and she started to turn into this monster -

230
00:33:35,677 --> 00:33:39,707
- and all the bones
in that body...they started to

00:33:43,552 --> 00:33:45,362
-... like a death spell...

232
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:50,090
...like a warewolf -

233
00:33:52,165 --> 00:33:56,085
- and she stopped smiling
she couldn't smiling anymore -

234
00:33:59,092 --> 00:34:02,374
- because she was throwing up

anyway, he had wife and kids -

286
00:41:32,145 --> 00:41:34,535
men like that should be
castrated

287
00:41:45,429 --> 00:41:46,649

- hello
hi -

294
00:43:03,013 --> 00:43:06,793
god, this is really hard
but this is my friend, Mona

295
00:43:07,361 --> 00:43:09,971
and she just had to have an abortion

296
00:43:11,414 --> 00:43:15,344
and what's that has to do
with me?
it was your husband's fetus

297
00:43:15,345 --> 00:43:19,900
Basically, what he did
was completely to waste it...
and he took advantage of her

298
00:43:19,901 --> 00:43:23,982
and now she is clinically depress
as you can see it
i mean she's just catatonic

299
00:43:23,983 --> 00:43:26,885
she haven't said a word since
have you Mona?

300
00:43:26,886 --> 00:43:31,315
I mean it could be....at the time
you not satisfied him enough at home
i mean...

301
00:43:31,316 --> 00:43:35,409
we all know we have a certain age
we all get sad but you know...

302
00:43:35,410 --> 00:43:38,741
..maybe you should keep your husband looked up
maybe you should castrate
your husband..

303
00:43:38,742 --> 00:43:43,562
why won't you two just go out
and leave me and my family alone...?

304
00:43:43,595 --> 00:43:48,655
It's just..you fully understand?
-get out of my face?
don't touch me!

305
00:43:49,183 --> 00:43:50,753
leave my family alone!

306
00:44:10,704 --> 00:44:11,334

313
00:45:03,434 --> 00:45:04,354
We're going!

314
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:28,460
they go there...

315
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:34,434
Is he got a girlfriend?

316
00:46:34,435 --> 00:46:37,907
As he thought of it...
he's got god
he's too busy with god

317
00:46:37,908 --> 00:46:40,508
With god is like that
one long life orgasm

318
00:46:40,509 --> 00:46:44,620
from you're born until you're dying
sin never goes down on him

319
00:46:44,621 --> 00:46:48,294
if anything goes wrong we're slowly
bring it down again, ok?

320
00:46:48,295 --> 00:46:50,205
ok,one,two,three,four..go.

321
00:46:58,594 --> 00:46:59,584
fucking..how..

322
00:47:09,777 --> 00:47:11,697
Ok again we deserve aplauze

323
00:47:27,767 --> 00:47:32,187
if i can be saved
anybody can be saved,
anybody can be saved

324
00:47:34,388 --> 00:47:36,903
the Lord Jesus started speaking to
me

325
00:47:36,904 --> 00:47:39,104
he told me to build this cross

326
00:47:39,889 --> 00:47:43,319
to claim this valley back,
in his name, for Him

327
00:47:46,433 --> 00:47:49,223
because there's evil work in this valey

328
00:47:49,362 --> 00:47:51,029
there's evil in this valley

329
00:47:51,030 --> 00:47:54,120
and it manifests itself in
hundreds of ways

330
00:47:54,819 --> 00:47:57,019
one person who's closer to god
today

331
00:47:57,020 --> 00:47:59,750
for our actions
then that's a victory

332
00:48:00,658 --> 00:48:03,038
it's a victory for everybody here

333
00:48:03,950 --> 00:48:09,807
we don't pray for richies,
we pray for fullfilments in our souls
and in our hearts first before, most of all

334
00:48:09,808 --> 00:48:13,348
but i have prayed for my sister,
who's there now

335
00:48:15,925 --> 00:48:20,754
this is the power of prayer
cause i've prayed to Lord for
my sister

336
00:48:20,755 --> 00:48:24,734
I've prayed that she'd be set free
because i know she's in turmoil

337
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:27,623
and so often
i can't reach out and tell her

338
00:48:27,624 --> 00:48:29,704
but I've prayed for her Lord

339
00:48:29,863 --> 00:48:31,593
I pray cause i love her

340
00:48:31,997 --> 00:48:35,224
And I know that the Lord
is answering to my prayers

341
00:48:35,225 --> 00:48:37,085
he answers all our prayers

342
00:49:19,184 --> 00:49:20,174
...yes lord...

343
00:49:33,745 --> 00:49:36,578
do you really think that
there is darkness in this valey?

344
00:49:36,579 --> 00:49:38,922
oh absolutely ye
there's darkness everywhere

345
00:49:38,923 --> 00:49:40,433
what about the devil?

346
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:43,643
yeah i know i was filled with Devil
at one point

347
00:49:43,644 --> 00:49:45,034
what were you like?

348
00:49:46,050 --> 00:49:50,557
i wasn't really a nice guy
i didn't think enough and
pour a glass in your face

349
00:49:50,558 --> 00:49:52,418
pounching you in the
nose

350
00:49:53,204 --> 00:49:55,404
and is it that Devil did that?

351
00:49:55,712 --> 00:49:57,783
yeah, the Devil drove me
yeah

352
00:49:57,784 --> 00:50:02,338
the Devil want you to do bad things
and he's got a grip of you

353
00:50:02,339 --> 00:50:05,319
must be interesting to believe in something

354
00:50:06,972 --> 00:50:12,632
yeah, but remember
there is Devil and there is God
and he is powerfull anywhere

355
00:50:32,903 --> 00:50:36,083
I am the Devil and I have
come to kill you

356
00:50:37,653 --> 00:50:40,143
I am possesed and I'll throw you..

357
00:50:44,859 --> 00:50:48,839
I raise my hands on you..
you devil...as I am a child of
Jesus

358
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:50,900
..........leave your body...!!!

359
00:51:08,693 --> 00:51:11,083
spirits say is anyone else
there?

360
00:51:19,501 --> 00:51:20,771

361
00:51:21,665 --> 00:51:23,925
you pushed it

362
00:51:26,255 --> 00:51:27,235

01:00:30,641 --> 01:00:32,731
why would you wanna go there?

418
01:00:46,113 --> 01:00:46,273
O

Omsk

Yeah, go on... it would be funney...

429

Oh hi

you can wait in the
sitting room
thanks

437
01:02:18,132 --> 01:02:21,982
Actually, there is something
i wanna talk to you about

438
01:02:30,275 --> 01:02:33,305
I have a real problem believing in anything

439
01:02:36,094 --> 01:02:37,024
or anyone....

440
01:02:39,252 --> 01:02:43,095
-and i can't stop thinking about
that day on the hill

441
01:02:43,096 --> 01:02:45,426
when you made that speech
and...

442
01:02:47,305 --> 01:02:48,865
and the way you spoke

443
01:02:51,258 --> 01:02:54,528
and everything you said...
i just believed you

444
01:02:54,567 --> 01:02:56,887
it was just god speaking thru me

445
01:02:57,304 --> 01:02:58,864
The Lord is the truth

446
01:02:59,622 --> 01:03:00,262
...and...

447
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:04,890
everything you were saying about the Devil
-...uhmm

448
01:03:05,720 --> 01:03:07,050
and all the demons

449
01:03:08,111 --> 01:03:09,759
you really believed that

450
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:10,330
oh yeah

451
01:03:11,136 --> 01:03:13,106
i've already met the demons

452
01:03:14,545 --> 01:03:16,045
and what did you do?

453
01:03:16,892 --> 01:03:20,142
I've asked Jesus Christ to
come into my life

454
01:03:20,456 --> 01:03:23,756
I've asked me to free me from
guilt,sin,fear

455
01:03:26,535 --> 01:03:29,085
and He came and
He washed 'em away

456
01:03:32,780 --> 01:03:34,680
I can do the same for you

457
01:03:36,620 --> 01:03:38,470
But He never speaks to me

458
01:03:40,028 --> 01:03:42,048
But you have to pray to Him

459
01:03:42,706 --> 01:03:43,276
ask Him

460
01:03:44,731 --> 01:03:46,531
- To come into your heart

461
01:03:48,184 --> 01:03:49,044
and He will

462
01:03:52,220 --> 01:03:53,600
he is a gentle God

463
01:03:54,425 --> 01:03:55,915
He is a God of love

464
01:03:57,141 --> 01:03:58,351
and he knows you

465
01:03:59,095 --> 01:04:01,415
he knows every hair on your head

466
01:04:03,799 --> 01:04:05,059
I can't feel Him

467
01:04:07,860 --> 01:04:10,760
I can't feel anything
I just feel empty

468
01:04:12,287 --> 01:04:13,617
-Lord can feel you

469
01:04:18,174 --> 01:04:19,784
He's in this room now

470
01:04:22,023 --> 01:04:24,043
He needs to be close to you

471
01:04:26,045 --> 01:04:29,755
and He want you to ask Him
to come into your heart

472
01:04:30,987 --> 01:04:33,597
he wants to reach out
and touch you

473
01:04:41,689 --> 01:04:43,419
He want you to feel Him

474
01:04:49,764 --> 01:04:51,734
He wants to come inside you

475
01:04:53,579 --> 01:04:55,439
