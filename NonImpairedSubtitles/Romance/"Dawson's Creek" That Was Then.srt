0
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:05,377
Be real nice, I might put
that bag up there for you.

1
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:08,697
-What's going on here?
-Who is this guy, Vicki?

2
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:10,379
To collect the necessary--

3
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:14,179
You could only marry one of us.

4
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:18,891
If I didn't know how you really felt
about Del, I'd think you were jealous.

5
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,056
Eat your cak e.

6
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:24,890
-I'll go.
-Howdy. We'd lik e to see the judge.

7
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:26,613
He's just having his dinner.

8
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:29,575
That's all right, Caroline. Come on in.

9
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,856
-Well, what is it?
-We got fired today.

10
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:35,376
Ed Carter's gun guards
run us off the property.

11
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:37,935
-Why were you fired?
-There's been too many hold-ups.

12
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:40,335
We've all been too
friendly to Jericho Howard.

13
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:45,170
-That's what Ed Carter says.
-Up to him to say who works for him.

14
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:58,052
Bad timing?
You're on your way out.

15
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:01,857
No, it's cosmic timing.
l was on my way to see you.

16
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:03,978
-Really?
-Yeah. Yeah, l was....

17
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:07,695
l was hoping that we could stand
awkwardly in a doorway, which...

18
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:12,132
-...is working out perfectly for me.
-lt's not awkward, Pacey.

19
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,616
-How about l come in?
-Great idea.

20
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:28,414
Can l get you anything?
You want something to drink?

21
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:30,690
No, l'm okay.

22
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,972
-You-- You hungry?
-You know what'd be nice?

23
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:37,290
Pizza? That's funny.
l was thinking pizza myself.

24
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:39,656
lt would be nice if we
could stop being polite.

25
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,852
l'm really glad that you said that.

26
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,130
l've been meaning
to emotionally abuse you.

27
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:47,298
-l wanted to make sure you're up for it.
-Pacey.

28
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,574
Okay, l'll stop.

29
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,408
Do you regret it?

30
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:03,132
-Which part?
-Do you regret telling me?

31
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:08,338
l guess it really depends on
whether or not you regretted hearing it.

32
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:14,259
lt's hard to regret hearing something
that's been in the back of your mind.

33
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:19,893
But l think l regret reality as...

34
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,692
...just a general concept.

35
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:24,658
Really?

36
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:28,138
Do you remember reading those
Choose Your Own Adventure books?

37
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:32,898
You and l both know that l was pretty
much illiterate until the ninth grade.

38
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:37,898
Right. Okay, well, l did.
But l cheated on them.

39
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,450
When a chapter wasn't
going the way l wanted...

40
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:44,016
...l wouldn't even finish. l would
just go back to the beginning until...

41
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:46,211
-...l got a happy ending.
-Everybody does it.

42
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:48,576
But it's not the most
realistic way to live.

43
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:52,859
What makes you think that one false
move is gonna ruin our entire story?

44
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:56,012
-History.
-That was then. Joey...

45
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:57,699
...l'm serious. We're older now.

46
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,858
lt's not like l'm gonna run out
if l don't like your choice.

47
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:08,258
Okay. Well, so....

48
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,374
What are you afraid of?

49
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:17,048
That the whole possibility thing
is really just a mean trick.

50
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:24,011
l don't like this chapter.
lt's too negative.

51
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,448
Look....

52
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:27,139
Maybe l'm just trying to...

53
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:30,412
...play out the scenarios to be
sure you and l have grown enough...

54
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:33,088
...to be together without
having to replay our history.

55
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:39,458
Because l'd really like
to look into our future.

56
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:44,815
-You want a clean slate.
-Well....

57
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:49,093
Yes and no. l just don't want my
prior offences being held against me.

58
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:52,776
Well, l mean, we agree.
You and l have...

59
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:57,013
...you know, said things and--
And done things that...

60
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:00,576
...we regret, but...

61
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:02,973
...we've changed, haven't we?

62
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,738
Yeah.

63
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:09,137
Yeah.

64
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,495
So l'm gonna go
think about some things.

65
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:20,779
And you're gonna think about things.

66
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:25,775
And you should probably go now
before l lose my ability to think clearly.

67
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:33,059
Well, okay, but...

68
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:36,616
...Pace, l don't know.
l mean, don't you think that...

69
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:39,459
...this is a little too delicate
to handle without a plan?

70
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:43,416
A plan. Well....

71
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:46,896
You know, l-- l appreciate
that you're a slave to structure...

72
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,978
...but l'm not sure how to
schedule life-changing decisions.

73
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,211
Well, what l meant...

74
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:55,374
...is that, you know...

75
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:57,969
-...l could call or you could call and--
-Right.

76
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:01,656
Like you've ever needed an excuse.

77
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:17,170
-Go.
-Of course.

78
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:22,015
What about that pizza thing?

79
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:25,417
Well, that would be
an entirely different story.

80
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:20,458
Surely you know how
difficult it is to secure a date...

81
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,776
...with a member of
the Sociology Department.

82
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:25,699
l mean, those women
are slick and fancy and...

83
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:29,097
...look at me like l'm the latest
study in the failure of modern man.

84
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,814
l thought you'd given up
since the last disaster.

85
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:36,571
l had, especially after time with Harley,
realizing how evil the fairer sex is...

86
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:39,852
...from conception.
But, l mean, come on, let's face it.

87
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:43,336
lf l don't do this now, l'm gonna
die alone in that old house.

88
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:48,694
What do you say? You can study, and l
can try to find a shirt from this decade.

89
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,492
Fine. Okay?

90
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:54,409
But l don't feel good about this dating
thing. l think it's time you look inward.

91
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:57,612
You're so wise since
distance left you single.

92
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:00,812
l'm not feeling right about
unleashing Harley on you yet either.

93
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,659
She's been loopy these days.
l think she's into the drugs.

94
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:07,250
lt's called hormones.
l wouldn't worry about it.

95
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:10,611
l'm-- l'm very worried
about her. She-- She--

96
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:15,530
She's got pictures of boys on the
ceiling. l mean, why there, Potter?

97
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:19,255
What purpose do you suppose those
pictures would serve in that location?

98
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:23,055
Professor Hetson,
Harley is completely normal.

99
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:25,535
One might even worry she's a cliché.

100
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:28,891
l don't like the sound of a normal girl.
l corrupted a lot of those.

101
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,660
They will do anything
to not be normal.

102
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,657
l want her to be more like you.

103
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:38,695
You know, anxious, bookish, prone to
boyfriends who live far, far away.

104
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:42,051
-Thank you.
-So no boys at the house...

105
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:45,417
...calling the house or slowing down
while they walk by the house.

106
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:47,093
You better watch it, you know.

107
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,495
Sexual deviation might
not be on Harley's mind...

108
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:52,168
...but if you keep being strict,
she's gonna realise...

109
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,291
...there's something
she's missing out on.

110
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:59,330
l've just accepted that l am powerless
against the high school alpha male.

111
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:02,498
l can't fight them, so l'm gonna
build a moat around the house.

112
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:06,137
l mean, what about you? You had
a boyfriend in high school, right?

113
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08,416
What was he like?

114
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,171
People change.

115
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:13,248
Three-thirty, Potter.

116
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:14,939
And leave your open mind at home.

117
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:21,329
Don't sully Harley with all that free will
and bringing out the best in people.

118
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,779
Dawson Leery, this is your life.

119
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:39,619
That's what l was just thinking.
How you doing, Mr. Gold?

120
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:42,288
The surreal nature
of things aside, just fine.

121
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,298
Thanks for coming in today, Dawson.
Class is pretty excited.

122
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,378
You've given them hope for escape.

123
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:51,453
So they haven't stopped to wonder
why l've come back.

124
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,696
l think they assume
they're just a pit stop.

125
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:57,016
-That would be nice.
-Slow going?

126
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,852
Well...

127
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,418
...l was trying to figure out a way
to tell these kids how to...

128
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:06,976
...make a success of themselves, so
l decided to watch all my old movies.

129
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,694
l wonder why
l didn't go to law school.

130
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:12,972
Sounds to me like you're ready to
take over my class. Let's go.

131
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,449
No, Marty, thank you, believe me.

132
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:21,938
Okay, l'll talk to you soon.
l'm gonna put you through.

133
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:23,892
Right. Bye.

134
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,292
Mr. Witter?

135
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,219
-What you got for me?
-There's a call for you on line one.

136
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:33,173
-I think it's--
-Okay, thank you.

137
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,894
Hello, what can l do--?
Hey, how you doing?

138
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:42,171
Okay, what hospital you guys at?

139
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:43,733
Okay. l'll be there soon, Mom.

140
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:54,452
Doug, Doug, hey.
Where is he?

141
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:58,255
They just took him down for tests, but
he's up, Pace. He's walking, at least.

142
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:01,532
l sent everyone else home. Mom was
exhausted, and l don't blame her.

143
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:04,254
-ls this his room here?
-Yeah, they'll be right back.

144
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:08,056
Dougie, what's with the old guy? ls that
the waiting room for the morgue?

145
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:10,649
-Just have a seat.
-Didn't you get him a private room?

146
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,693
We tried. They were full.
There wasn't time to argue over this.

147
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,453
There's time now, isn't there?

148
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:19,019
-What kind of tests is he having?
-Just routine tests.

149
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:22,536
-Was it a heart attack?
-No, not exactly. lt's what they call...

150
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,014
...an exaggerated arrhythmia.

151
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:27,059
l don't understand much
about the whole medical science--

152
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:30,656
Who can l find around here who
does know what they're talking about?

153
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:34,454
You know what? l'd love
to sit and walk you through this.

154
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:37,254
That's what l intended,
but you don't blow in here...

155
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:40,418
...and accuse me of not knowing,
since l've been here all day.

156
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,810
l'd have been here sooner
if you called sooner.

157
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:45,051
l'm sorry, but we were kind of busy.

158
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:47,535
l was trying to keep Mom
from having a breakdown...

159
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,771
...while our father
was being rushed off.

160
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:52,056
l'm sorry if things aren't
up to snuff here...

161
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,575
...but we were concentrating
on important things.

162
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,254
Like the fact Dad survived.

163
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:23,888
So any questions?

164
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,330
Todd Carr's the guy
who directed the film, right?

165
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,219
Yeah. Yeah, he directed...

166
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,854
...everything. Except
for the ending, which is...

167
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,972
-...pretty drastically di--
-Todd Carr is known for directing...

168
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:39,217
...gratuitous, fleshy music videos
and the occasional blood-fest.

169
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:41,615
But you're more of a
sentimental realist, right?

170
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:48,570
-ls that the word on the street?
-l showed some copies of your work.

171
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:52,689
You know, for a
little compare and contrast.

172
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,731
So when faced
with a different style...

173
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:59,053
...patching together someone's work,
is it a struggle not to put yourself in?

174
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:02,576
Fortunately, l had gotten
to know Todd so well...

175
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:05,692
...and we worked on it so long,
we ended up having a shared vision.

176
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:08,693
You think that's good,
given the film went straight to cable?

177
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,217
And you didn't go
to film school, right?

178
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:12,888
No, l didn't.

179
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:18,538
Woody Allen dropped out of NYU,
so it's all just how you wanna learn.

180
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,535
Do you have a minute or 1 8?

181
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:35,013
-Yeah. l'm sorry. What's your name?
-George.

182
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:39,213
l'd really like to show you my film.
Mr. Gold said it might be a good idea.

183
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,611
-Personal stuff.
-l'd love to.

184
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:45,374
Give me 1 0 minutes,
and then we'll watch it here.

185
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:47,810
lf that's all right with Mr. Gold.

186
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:51,171
Cool. Hey, thanks, Mr. Leery.

187
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,939
Please tell me he
didn't just call me mister.

188
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,414
My name is Ben, by the way.

189
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:02,335
He's quite a kid, George.

190
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:04,531
He thinks he knows a lot.

191
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,412
He must be a
handful in the classroom.

192
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:11,892
Dawson, waiting six years for you to
experience all this was well worth it.

193
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,091
Thanks again.

194
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:44,891
Please don't. l can hear myself
thinking when it's quiet. lt scares me.

195
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:48,610
l'd be scared too if l were writing
a paper your father wanted to read.

196
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:52,051
ln fact, the same thing
has scared me many a time.

197
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:54,376
-What page are you on?
-lt's all up here.

198
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,688
Right.

199
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:59,016
Harley, you gotta work with me here.

200
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:02,018
Your dad won't get any
easier if you keep aggravating him.

201
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:06,014
-Why do you care so much?
-Well....

202
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:09,530
When he loses control over you, he
wields his power over everyone else.

203
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:14,252
So you're a smart girl, l want
to see an intro in half an hour.

204
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:16,969
-How do you know?
-You're already bored with life.

205
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:20,092
Which is gonna get worse if
you spend your teen years locked up.

206
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,416
So get to it.

207
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:27,257
Subtle, Patrick. Real subtle.

208
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,219
l got a little excited in there
with all your girly things.

209
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:32,052
l have a ski parka in there, freak.

210
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:35,378
lt still smells like girl.

211
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:42,210
l do, however, have to--

212
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,855
This is Patrick.

213
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,252
He's my study partner.

214
00:14:55,100 --> 00:15:00,777
And as you can see, you can do this.
I'll put it in my machine and....

215
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:02,976
Set it and forget it!

216
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:07,850
Eighteen minutes a pound for
a pork loin roast or for a leg of lamb...

217
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:11,018
-Coffee.
-... or for a roast beef. Okay?

218
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:14,690
Here's our pork loin roast. On the top.
Lift that up there. Look at this.

219
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:17,778
-Oh, look at that.
-We have our potatoes and our beans.

220
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:21,057
Now, it only uses 1 200 watts--

221
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,813
They moved him.

222
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:26,137
Yeah. l went ahead and
got him that private room.

223
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:28,490
Oh, good for you.

224
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,611
How'd you swing that, slip him a 20?

225
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:36,012
That's one way to solve it, l guess.

226
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:37,494
Doug, l'm sorry.

227
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:42,415
l got myself all worked up on the drive
thinking about the possibilities and...

228
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:48,929
...l appreciate the fact that you've been
here. l am sorry. l was just on edge.

229
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:56,175
Try having breakfast with Dad and
see him grab his chest and fall over.

230
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:02,419
l mean, have you ever seen him
off-guard one single day in your life?

231
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:04,258
No.

232
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:07,089
No. Not even close.

233
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:11,414
Which is probably what's so scary
about this whole thing. l mean...

234
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:14,692
...l spent so long pushing the
old man's buttons in high school...

235
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,777
...l forgot there were
real feelings left.

236
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:37,218
Okay, Patrick, if that's even your
real name. Let's see what you got.

237
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:41,933
You can help Harley out of her rut,
since you're her study pal and all.

238
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:46,730
-l'm actually not in that class.
-No!

239
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:49,898
-l'm shocked.
-Look, Joey, l get it.

240
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,135
Boy in room, bad.

241
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:53,530
lt's not like we were in
our skivvies, okay?

242
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:57,568
Yeah, l mean, a girl like you must've
broken the rules once or twice.

243
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:01,340
-Know what l mean?
-No, l don't know what you mean.

244
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:06,976
Look, Josephine,
l didn't mean to cause any trouble.

245
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:10,650
And l don't want to get in the middle
of whatever bond you and Harley got.

246
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:13,055
And l'm sure the three
of us can work together.

247
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:19,015
Not in the way you're
thinking, l'm afraid.

248
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,933
Harley, l've clearly
caused some stress here.

249
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:26,973
l respect the responsibility
this woman's taking in your life.

250
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:29,290
How old exactly do you think l am?

251
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:34,538
Well, it's not old so much
as wise, really.

252
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:37,692
You seem to be a timeless sort.

253
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:39,532
Pained by the world.

254
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,173
But more beautiful
because of it.

255
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:45,848
That's very deep.

256
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:50,659
Unfortunately, l know your kind,
and you're harmless.

257
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:56,495
So you are staying down here for the
rest of the night and studying for real.

258
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:25,648
This is Joey. Sorry I missed you.
Please leave a mess--

259
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:28,778
Hey, Pace, he's awake.
We can go in now.

260
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:34,137
You gotta lay off red meat, Mr. Witter.

261
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:35,898
Hey, boys.

262
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:38,056
This must be your
other son, Mr. Witter.

263
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:41,696
Yeah, this is-- This is Pacey, doc.
He's the one l was telling you about.

264
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,777
Yeah, the black sheep.
Pleased to meet you.

265
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:47,138
Your father was just going
on and on about how proud he is.

266
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:50,013
Yeah, who'd have thunk it, huh?
He turned out all right.

267
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:53,496
Gonna be taking care of
all of us one of these days.

268
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,453
Yeah. Anyway, how
you feeling? You doing okay?

269
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:59,536
Thanks for coming, Pace.
lt means a lot.

270
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:01,054
l know how busy you are.

271
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:06,055
l don't mean to break things up,
but you're still pretty weak, Mr. Witter.

272
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:08,376
One kid at a time, okay?

273
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,730
l can just wait outside
till you guys are ready.

274
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:13,375
No, Pace.
l want you to stay.

275
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,728
Come on, sit down.

276
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:20,099
Okay. That's okay.

277
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:23,258
You know, l've been
here all day, right? So....

278
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:27,090
Thanks, Dougie.

279
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:29,571
All right.

280
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:34,417
Did you drive down?

281
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,770
Yeah, yeah, l came
down as quick as l could.

282
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:39,096
-Not much traffic?
-No.

283
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:43,259
-Who's coming to Capeside?
-Yeah, well, you were.

284
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:46,095
Thanks. l appreciate it, Pace.

285
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,739
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

286
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:14,938
-For what?
-Your silence speaks volumes.

287
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:19,293
You don't know me well enough
to know what my silence means.

288
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:24,171
With Mr. Gold, he's trying to formulate
the best possible way to eviscerate me.

289
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:26,172
What did he say?

290
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,539
Why won't you talk about my film?

291
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:33,734
All right, look. l'm....

292
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:36,408
l'm new at this, George. l mean...

293
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:39,569
...do you have any idea
how it is to come back...

294
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,975
...and try and say something
profound about life?

295
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:45,611
No offence, and other obligatories...

296
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:50,450
...but l'm as ill-suited to analyse your
doubt as you are to critique my film.

297
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:53,292
And my mother
serves dinner at 6, so--

298
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:56,976
l'm stalling, George, because
l don't know what to say, all right?

299
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:58,972
l mean, keep going.

300
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,211
You know, your film's good.
lt's very good.

301
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:04,735
Yeah, you got stuff to learn.
l mean, you know...

302
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:10,537
...trust yourself when you go for shots.
Work on continuity. Other than that...

303
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:14,131
...the important stuff,
the stuff you can't teach is--

304
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:17,889
-lt's there.
-So l'm a natural genius?

305
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,897
There's nothing left
for me here?

306
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:23,337
-You are like me when l was your age.
-Yeah?

307
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:25,656
-Mr. Gold said that too.
-Did he?

308
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,891
Well....

309
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:32,976
Remember this feeling.

310
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:36,934
Remember what it was like to make
a film about something that you loved.

311
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:40,610
Have the confidence to do it your way,
to control your vision, keep it your own.

312
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:42,048
l mean, that's....

313
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:47,528
-l miss that.
-Yeah.

314
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:50,300
You do have the stink
of a burnt-out talent on you.

315
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,930
lt's scary.

316
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:56,897
Yeah, l'm a poster child.
Get out of here before l rub off on you.

317
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:08,532
l thought it was good. Creek Daze.

318
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:11,971
Syrupy sweet with
lame music and all that.

319
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:14,057
But not many too people
have heart anymore.

320
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,939
You can't lose that, right?

321
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:22,172
Hope not.

322
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:31,213
All right. Stay in school, keep
your nose clean. Don't do sports.

323
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,809
Anyway, l blame your mother, Pacey.

324
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:49,810
She got herself this new cookbook,
Bacon Mak es the World Go Round.

325
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:54,377
Well, l guess that's not the
worst concept l've ever heard of.

326
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:58,493
Well, it is when the bacon is
going on top of the apple crisp.

327
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:01,335
l think she's trying to kill me.

328
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:06,170
Which is funny because you're the only
one in the family who's got any money.

329
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:11,976
This is serious.
lf you got heart problems...

330
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:14,535
-...you really gotta take care of that.
-Calm down.

331
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:18,130
This is nothing.
Just a little exaggerated arrhythmia.

332
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:21,093
Hell, you probably
got the same thing.

333
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:23,211
l don't know why your
brother's worked up.

334
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:26,338
Well, l think you gave him
a bit of a scare.

335
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:28,337
He said you went down pretty hard.

336
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:30,536
He's just looking for some drama.

337
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:32,856
He needs to get out more.

338
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,979
He needs to get a life like you.

339
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:41,137
Listen, it can't be good for you,
being away from the office this much.

340
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:44,209
l'm pretty sure they'll understand.

341
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:47,213
-What about your clients?
-You're my father.

342
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:55,851
You really would do anything for me.

343
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:01,735
Even after everything, you're still....

344
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:06,176
You grew up to be one
of the good guys, Pacey.

345
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:09,531
But l always knew you would.

346
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:12,052
l should've told you that more often.

347
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,775
Well, maybe l just
didn't always hear you.

348
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,696
Joey, l noticed you're
reading Don DeLillo.

349
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:57,088
-White Noise is one of my favourites.
-Really?

350
00:24:57,300 --> 00:25:00,531
And when in your 1 5 years of life
did you manage to read this?

351
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:02,577
l'm 1 6, actually.

352
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:04,771
l look younger than l am.

353
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:06,971
l just got my license.
You wanna see?

354
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:09,899
Will you please shut up?
l'm trying to write.

355
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:12,700
Oh, l'm sorry. Joey and l can
go in the other room.

356
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:15,659
-No, we can't.
-Patrick, why don't you just leave.

357
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:18,135
-What's your problem?
-You really have to ask?

358
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:19,568
l asked you here to study.

359
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:22,854
-You and l both know--
-Okay, fine. Whatever.

360
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:26,291
l asked you over here to be with me.
Not salivate over my babysitter.

361
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:29,572
-You know how gross that is?
-l can't believe you need a babysitter.

362
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:32,573
When your parents go,
don't you stay with the Johnsons?

363
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:34,333
Yeah, that's just for safety.

364
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:36,451
So you don't choke
on your own spittle.

365
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:38,258
That's enough from the both of you.

366
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:41,731
-Can we just forget it and move on?
-Easy for you to say, Helen.

367
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:46,450
-Excuse me?
-The face that launched 1 000 ships.

368
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:49,254
Get people riled up and
then knit somewhere in solitude.

369
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,855
Okay. l think you're
mixing up your epics.

370
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:55,937
The point is, my boyfriend
is blatantly flirting with you.

371
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:58,978
-Would you really call it that?
-Am l your boyfriend?

372
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,819
l hate you so much right now.

373
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:04,093
l hate you with the burning
passion of a thousand STDs.

374
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,530
-We haven't had the talk.
-No, how could we?

375
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:08,896
Whenever l try to
be serious with you...

376
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:12,251
...you turn into some freak of nature
and you do stuff like this.

377
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:14,691
-Like what?
-Like staring at Joey all night.

378
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:17,056
Selling me out in
homeroom when we're late.

379
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:20,377
Not agreeing to go to the dance
with me until Lauren Riley said no.

380
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:24,135
Okay, the homeroom thing was because
l was trying to save your reputation.

381
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:26,855
And the Lauren thing
was purely defensive.

382
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:29,771
And, you know, l got scared.

383
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:31,572
l don't know. l-- l was just...

384
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:33,850
-...keeping my options open.
-Options?

385
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:36,369
Yeah, well, take me
off your list of options.

386
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:39,817
That should make things so much
easier for your tortured, ass-y soul.

387
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:48,575
Shouldn't have said that thing
about the options.

388
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,771
To begin with.

389
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:52,299
Hey, there you are. Dougie...

390
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:55,060
-...Dad's ready to see you now.
-Yeah, that's okay.

391
00:26:55,260 --> 00:27:00,414
The nurse said they'll be shutting down
visiting hours, so let's get a move on.

392
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,935
Did he ask for me?

393
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:06,288
What, like did he send for you?

394
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:11,451
We're talking about our father, not the
king. He knows we're both here for him.

395
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:17,016
l love the knowledge you acquired on
Dad in the hour that you've been here.

396
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:20,257
Throwing around paternal references
like they're going out of style.

397
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:23,456
You've always been more up
on fashion than me.

398
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:26,891
Just don't even start, Pacey.
For once.

399
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:29,779
l know you're on your game since
Dad's given you the nod--

400
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:33,529
Okay, okay, hold on. What is it that
you actually want to talk to me about?

401
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:35,139
From my way of seeing things...

402
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:37,570
...we are just trying to take care
of our family.

403
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:41,893
No, Pacey, l'm the one who's been
taking care of the family for years.

404
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:44,700
Oh, now, Doug, don't
you dare get righteous on me.

405
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:48,211
You cannot lord your resentment
over me, because that was your choice.

406
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:50,894
Yeah, l do happen to make choices.

407
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:53,933
That's a foreign concept to
someone who plays musical careers.

408
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:56,455
How did we get here?
Am l stepping on your turf?

409
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:59,458
Are you the only member of the
family who's allowed to care?

410
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:02,737
What did you expect me to do?
Chomp on my cigar on the phone...

411
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:06,091
...and cut a check for the man's
funeral? l'm a member of this family.

412
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:09,776
Yeah, conveniently. l mean,
that's the way it is with you lately.

413
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:15,413
You swoop in with your gifts and you
pull the wool over the family's eyes.

414
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:17,412
And then you're out.

415
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:21,613
-And everybody forgets.
-Forgets what?

416
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:23,492
That l'm the family failure?

417
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:26,612
Am l never supposed to grow up?
Am l not allowed to want things?

418
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:30,489
Oh, no, we all want things, Pacey.
Believe me, we all want things.

419
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:33,214
-Nobody would deny you that.
-Then what?

420
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,092
l'm just not supposed to get them.

421
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:37,860
So ultimately,
this is not about our father.

422
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:41,814
Which is kind of pathetic, considering
the condition that that man is in.

423
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:46,457
This is about wanting to see my face
and know that you're still the good son.

424
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:49,697
That you're top dog.
Well, that's just sad.

425
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:54,489
l miss the daily beatings as much as
you do, but l had to leave sometime.

426
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:57,300
Pacey, don't make this
a celebration of your retreat.

427
00:28:57,540 --> 00:29:01,852
l'm not. Man, listen to yourself
speak. l came here to see you.

428
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:04,016
To see him.
And you know what?

429
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:05,778
He knows it and he appreciates it.

430
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:10,776
Perhaps he's happy that the son he
ignored for the better part of his life...

431
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:14,017
...is not gonna hold a grudge
against him until the day he dies.

432
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:17,608
ln a strange way,
this might even be a good thing.

433
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:21,091
Yeah, you know what?
lt is a good thing, Pacey.

434
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:25,370
lt's all yours, little brother.
lt's all yours.

435
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:29,254
Enjoy it while it lasts.

436
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:41,539
Harley, come on.

437
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:44,891
You're blowing this
way out of proportion.

438
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:51,534
Yeah, come on, Harley.

439
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:55,096
This probably isn't the
last time l'll incur your wrath.

440
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:58,578
l mean that in the best way possible.

441
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,612
-You ever had a girlfriend?
-Was it bad?

442
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:02,418
She likes it when we fight.

443
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:05,418
That's the only form of communication
you seem capable of.

444
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:08,811
l'm capable of other forms. l think.

445
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:12,733
Look, Joey. Harley's
way smarter than l am.

446
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:16,609
l tried the so-called normal thing
with her once, and it wasn't pretty.

447
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:20,176
l was complimenting her
and l felt all sweaty.

448
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:23,417
-l was a freaking mess.
-Despite what you think...

449
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:26,453
...the sweaty palms and such
is actually pretty endearing.

450
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:28,408
Harley!

451
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,850
Yeah, it's endearing for five seconds.

452
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:35,975
Then she'll look at Peter Garran and be
smitten with his unavailability...

453
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:39,490
...and l'll be history.
lf l keep up with the witty abuse...

454
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:43,136
-...at least l'll be the funny one.
-lt's true.

455
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:45,217
Oh, my God. lt is true.

456
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:47,012
You guys are all the same.

457
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:50,131
Joey, you've got--
You've got some anger.

458
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:53,415
You've been hurt.
Maybe you've lost someone.

459
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:54,973
So have you.

460
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:56,853
Harley.

461
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:59,938
l never could've held on
to a firecracker like her.

462
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:03,655
Maybe l need someone
who's more settled in her ways.

463
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:05,851
An older woman,
if you know what l mean.

464
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:09,812
You and me?
lt's not gonna happen.

465
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:12,569
And, look, Harley
is this great sassy girl...

466
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:15,852
...who if she's smart
will never speak to you again.

467
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:18,008
You slay me, Joey.

468
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:26,649
The only thing l want to do
to you is give you some advice.

469
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:29,336
Walk away right now.

470
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:31,935
Don't ever mention me again.

471
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:35,052
Go home and strum your guitar,
or whatever it is you do.

472
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:38,935
And then dream up some
fantastic gesture to get this girl back.

473
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:42,177
And never think that you have
to stop doing that sort of thing.

474
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:44,848
The worst thing a guy
can do is give up the chase.

475
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:48,217
And Patrick-- Patrick, Patrick.

476
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:50,690
Be realistic.

477
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:54,256
lf l wasn't such a nice girl, l would've
laughed and called you Junior.

478
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:56,768
Then why didn't you?

479
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:00,097
Because you remind me
of somebody l know.

480
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:04,015
Get out before l remember everything
that pissed me off about him.

481
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:08,850
-We might never speak again.
-l'm crying inside. Goodbye, Junior.

482
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:13,416
Harley. Come on,
it's just me. Please?

483
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:17,452
-Hey.
-Hey.

484
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:24,857
l just wanted to stop by before they
close up shop, see how you feel.

485
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:27,494
l feel like l could use a Scotch.

486
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:28,928
Other than that, l'm fine.

487
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:32,098
Maybe l could stop by in the
morning before l head back.

488
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:35,776
-Yeah.
-Dougie, l'll see you back at the house.

489
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:37,897
Yeah, maybe.

490
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:41,816
-Good night, guys.
-Pacey...

491
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:44,090
...thanks for getting me
this private room.

492
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:51,528
No, that wasn't me.
Doug took care of the room.

493
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:54,413
But good seeing you, Pop.
Feel better.

494
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:09,537
Harley!

495
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:22,857
Hope l didn't put a damper
on your evening.

496
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:25,489
Sounds like you two were
having a swell old time.

497
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:28,009
You and l are mildly
acquainted, correct?

498
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:30,370
Yeah, whatever.

499
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:33,773
l wouldn't go after your guy.

500
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:37,098
-lt's just not kosher.
-l know you wouldn't go for Patrick.

501
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:40,770
-You're a girl's girl and all that.
-And he wouldn't go after me.

502
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:42,493
He was just...

503
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:44,975
...doing what they do,
which is testing the limits.

504
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:48,610
l get that, Joey. l know that half
the time Patrick's just testing me.

505
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:53,178
What l don't get is, why would he test
something that's on shaky ground?

506
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:58,895
He started messing with me before
we figured out if we were together.

507
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:01,377
Was it this hard for
you in high school?

508
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:03,851
Of course.

509
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:06,699
l mean, but everything's
twenty-twenty in hindsight.

510
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:10,939
You know, now all of the problems
that Pacey and l had seem petty.

511
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:15,179
And all the obstacles that Dawson and
l went through just seem unnecessary.

512
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:18,492
Dude, how many
boyfriends did you have?

513
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:22,337
lt's not as racy as it sounds.

514
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:25,734
Okay, so how do
l skip the middle part?

515
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:29,410
Like, if you could tell yourself
something back then, what would it be?

516
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:34,294
l've been wondering lately...

517
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,536
...why things were different.

518
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:41,018
You know, why l could talk
to Eddie without being scared.

519
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:45,418
And, you know, when
you're 1 6 years old...

520
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:48,339
...so many of your choices
are motivated by fear.

521
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:52,050
You know, like, one wrong move
and the world's gonna end.

522
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:57,175
And maybe that's what it is.
Maybe it's just about....

523
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:02,052
l don't know, taking
a deep breath and...

524
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:05,609
...forgiving yourself
for yesterday's mistakes.

525
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:10,259
You're gonna walk in tomorrow,
and you're gonna wanna punch Patrick.

526
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:14,971
But he might just say something
that makes you change your mind.

527
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:17,739
Hear it, Harley.

528
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:21,291
So....

529
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:25,573
Don't be afraid to move forward.

530
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:31,575
lf all of this is about Eddie, why didn't
you follow him across the country?

531
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:35,539
Because it's not just about him.

532
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:38,651
lt's....

533
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:42,929
lt's about me and...

534
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:46,128
-...what l'm ready for.
-What are you ready for?

535
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:51,218
That, young lady,
is none of your business.

536
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:52,978
Your father's gonna be home soon...

537
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:58,015
...and l don't think l saw too much
essay writing happening down there.

538
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:02,017
Okay, okay. God, when is
this battleaxe thing ever gonna end?

539
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:05,935
l mean, you're becoming
highly unpleasant.

540
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:10,099
Never. l'm honing
my wench skills. Chop-chop!

541
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,059
Pacey?

542
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:45,019
Dawson.

543
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:46,448
What are you doing here?

544
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:50,654
Long story. At the moment, bringing
in firewood. What are you doing here?

545
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:56,736
l wanted to check on your mom,
see how the repairs are going.

546
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:02,372
-Wow, that's.... Thank you.
-Yeah.

547
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:05,538
You all right?

548
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:10,014
Yeah, l'm fine. But l checked
my dad into the hospital today.

549
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:13,452
-Oh, my God. ls he okay?
-Yeah, he'll be okay. lt was...

550
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:18,017
...a heart condition. But he's gonna get
out in the morning, so he'll be all right.

551
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:21,889
But, you know, no matter
how tough you think your dad is...

552
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:26,776
...it's a little disconcerting seeing
him laying there all vulnerable.

553
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:28,572
Yeah.

554
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:30,373
Can turn your world upside down.

555
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:33,328
Yeah.

556
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:35,258
Which is what made me think of you.

557
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:41,614
And probably a lot of
what brought me out here.

558
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:47,417
l just-- l wasn't ready
for that, you know?

559
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:49,019
lt's the first time l just--

560
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:51,529
l wanted to let somebody else
take care of it.

561
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:55,291
l know what you mean.

562
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:59,011
l don't know when this happened.

563
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:01,290
l'm the one who makes sure
the house is warm...

564
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:04,373
...and you became the one
who checks up on repairs.

565
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:07,378
l do not know, but sometimes
l feel like l've been...

566
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:09,935
...playing the part, wearing
the suit for so long...

567
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:13,733
...l may have forgotten how
l got there in the first place.

568
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:16,653
l know you deal with this more,
but some kid called me sir.

569
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:20,332
-What is that?
-l know. lt's strange.

570
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:23,134
Every time l hear '' Mr. Witter,''
l look over my shoulder.

571
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:26,457
-Who called you sir?
-This kid in my--

572
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:30,130
l almost said this kid in my class.
l went to Capeside High today.

573
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:32,810
-What, in your mind?
-Almost.

574
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:35,454
No. l went to go talk to
Mr. Gold's film class.

575
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:38,134
-Get out of here. Really?
-Yeah.

576
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:42,848
l guess that's what they
call coming full circle, huh?

577
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:44,288
Yeah.

578
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:47,094
Yeah, l went there.
l was supposed to talk about...

579
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:52,693
...where l am now and the glamour
of the real world and all that, but....

580
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:55,768
lt was weird, Pace.

581
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:58,972
Watching this kid's film, all l thought
was, '' l don't know anything.''

582
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:03,337
Or maybe l did, and l just...

583
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:06,336
...lost it somewhere along the way.

584
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:08,939
Yeah, l know what you mean. l do.

585
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:15,896
Being here.

586
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:21,493
Being at the school, all these ghosts.
l wanna go back. l wanna start over.

587
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:23,019
Do things the right way.

588
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:28,011
Yeah.

589
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,333
Yeah, l'd like the time back.

590
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:33,857
But l wouldn't have it the way it was.

591
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:41,733
l just want to pinpoint that moment in
your life where everything goes wrong.

592
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:46,298
-l'm thinking it was probably puberty.
-Yeah, l could skip that too.

593
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:50,056
lf you didn't have loves, you wouldn't
have anything to make movies about.

594
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:51,528
Sure.

595
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:53,658
Except now that l actually...

596
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:57,136
...have enough distance and
l can actually say something about...

597
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:59,410
...the loves, l can't
afford to make movies.

598
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:01,059
Afford?

599
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:02,932
Those are the people l cater to.

600
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:06,769
-Come on. l'm a wizard of high finance.
-Right, right, right.

601
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:09,369
l'm the kind of person you prey on.

602
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:11,536
Sentimental loser
with 1 0-cent dreams.

603
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:15,216
-More like 1 0,000, but who's counting?
-l'm sorry, but...

604
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:17,217
...you're just freaking me out there.

605
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:20,536
We can talk about
that some other time, sir.

606
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:22,532
All right.

607
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:34,132
l just made some coffee. Do you wanna
come in and sit down for a while?

608
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:36,058
lt's been a long day.

609
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:39,969
Yeah. Yeah, l'd love that, man.

610
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:33,810
Hey, you've reached my cell phone.
Sorry I missed you, leave a message.

611
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:37,096
Hi, it's me.

612
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:40,815
So l thought that l would have an
answer when l picked up the phone...

613
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:42,248
...but l didn't.

614
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:44,576
And then l thought l would...

615
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:48,693
...think of something
as l was talking...

616
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:51,730
...but no such luck.

617
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:54,731
Pace...

618
00:41:55,300 --> 00:42:00,658
...l think the problem is trying to figure
this out alone. l think that we should...

619
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:03,374
...do it together, you know?

620
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:06,331
And...

621
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:10,818
...you know how they say if you could
do it over, what would you change?

622
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:13,172
Well...

623
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:17,576
...l'd probably change a lot of things.

624
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:21,534
But l'm also really lucky
that l have the chance.

625
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:23,537
And...

626
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:30,017
...what l'm saying is l'm not gonna
think of everything that happened.

627
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:36,255
l'm gonna look at you and
think of everything that could.

628
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:44,491
Call me.

629
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:47,372
Bye.

630
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:36,136
