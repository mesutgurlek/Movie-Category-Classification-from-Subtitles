1
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:44,993
Ooh! ln all my years,
never have I seen the streets...

2
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,430
so full of bustle and hustle
and assorted commotion.

3
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,357
Our princess is to wed.

4
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,996
Ohh, wonderful!
And who's the lucky prince?

5
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,352
Not a prince at all.
Just a no-account street rat!

6
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:03,075
No way! Try it phonetically.

7
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,237
It's Aladdin!

8
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,389
Aw! Some of you don't believe.

9
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,117
In colour!

10
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,039
There's a party here in Agrabah
There's excitement in the air

11
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,276
People pouring in
from near and far

12
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,675
'Cause Jasmine and Aladdin
are gonna have a weddin'

13
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:38,998
There's a party here in Agrabah
Everybody will be there

14
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:43,352
So if you're a pauper or a shah
Do somethin' with your hair

15
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,755
You mustn't wear
an outfit that's naughty

16
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,871
A turban that's unravelling
just won't do

17
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,195
No earrings that are
tasteless or gaudy

18
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,515
You're gonna look gorgeous
when I get through

19
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,758
There's a party here in Agrabah
So I'm going to paint the town

20
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,396
If you want to see what colours are
Follow me around

21
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,991
Aladdin's gettin' married and it's
gonna be the wedding of the century

22
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:10,193
My buddy's gettin' married and
you're gonna see just how much I can do

23
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,436
- You've heard of
your safari bar mitzvahs
- Wow!

24
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,676
- You've all been to a luau sweet 16
- Ahh!

25
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,870
Well, none of them compare
to what this is

26
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,991
The food'll be disgusting
By evening you'll be busting

27
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,318
There's a party here in Agrabah
and it's got us all aglow

28
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,830
If a street rat could've come so far
Maybe I could do it

29
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:30,032
- Sure, there's nothing to it
- There's a party here in Agrabah

30
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,832
But we're not sure
that we'll go

31
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:36,476
For although the bride is la-di-dah
The groom is awfully low

32
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:41,230
And now we take you down
to the palace, where everyone
has celebrated all night long.

33
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,432
Without Jafar and all of his malice
Everybody's happy

34
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,516
What could possibly go wrong?

35
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,713
There's a party here in Agrabah
and we're gonna rob 'em blind

36
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,435
While they're all munching caviar
create a small disturbance

37
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,596
I will sneak up from behind

38
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,872
There's a party here in Agrabah
and the loot is pouring in

39
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,355
I like this wedding stuff so far

40
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,677
Maybe if I'm pleasant
I'll get to keep a present

41
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,711
We've ordered just
a few tasteful flowers

42
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,035
And valets who'll
carefully park for you

43
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,230
The bridesmaids have
been dressing for hours

44
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,032
Girls, you look just lovely
And so grown-up too

45
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:19,711
There's a party here in Agrabah
Guests are filling up the room

46
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,673
But there's something missing
Yes, aha

47
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,189
Where is the groom

48
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,959
Hello.

49
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,470
Somebody's gonna be late
for his own wedding!

50
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,909
Hold on, Genie.
There's something I need.

51
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,156
I gotcha.

52
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:56,114
It's a bachelor party, big boy!

53
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:59,471
- None for you.
You're the designated flyer.
- No.

54
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,512
This is for the wedding.

55
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,194
Well, that's, uh--
that's a nice dagger.

56
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:12,632
Interesting nuptial accessory.
It's a, uh, a bit sharp.

57
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,752
- It belonged to my father.
- Your father?

58
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,075
You never said a word
about your father.

59
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,829
Oh, I've got to let the caterer know!
Chicken or sea bass?

60
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:26,078
He's not coming to the wedding.
He died a long time ago.

61
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,760
- Sorry.
- That's okay.

62
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,910
I never knew him.

63
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,156
Maybe if I did,
I'd feel ready for this.

64
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:37,556
Al, are you getting cold feet?

65
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,592
No, Genie. It's just that...

66
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,077
I-l've always been a street rat,
stealin' what I need to survive,

67
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,475
- runnin' from the guards,
- Uh-huh.

68
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,114
- Iivin' my life alone.
- Ohh.

69
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,471
I'm takin' a big step today
into a new world.

70
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,353
Today's topic: fears
of the future family man.

71
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,313
AI from Agrabah, share with us.

72
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,000
I never had a father to show me
how to raise a family.

73
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,270
No role model.
Get a little deeper.

74
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,470
What do I know about families?

75
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,431
Genie, what if
I'm no good at it?

76
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,994
Ah, if my father were here--

77
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,829
Al, little buddy, if your father were
here, he'd be as proud of you as I am.

78
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,153
I just wish he could see this.

79
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,874
There's a party here in Agrabah

80
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,798
And the party's all for me

81
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,753
Just look, you guys
at where we are

82
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,633
And how our dreams
have come to be

83
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:36,629
There's a party here in Agrabah
and I can't believe it's true

84
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:39,194
After all this waiting
here we are

85
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:42,392
We'll finally get to say
"I do"

86
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,034
I never, ever had a real family

87
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:48,118
I never, ever had
a real, true friend

88
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,913
Someone who could just
understand me

89
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,429
Hey, come on, Aladdin!
This mush has gotta end!

90
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:58,111
There's a party here in Agrabah
and it's starting right away

91
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,470
Let's get ya dressed
'cause you're the star

92
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,830
Hey, come on
It's your wedding day

93
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,954
Aladdin's gettin' married
and it's gonna be

94
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,514
The wedding of the century

95
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,995
Amazing how Aladdin
could've come so far

96
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,315
- They're finally getting married!
- They're finally getting married!

97
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,635
- They're finally getting married!
- Look at all these presents!

98
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,990
We're finally getting married.

99
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,270
- I'm finally gettin' married!
- They're finally gettin' married!

100
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:38,229
At the party in Agrabah

101
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,397
There's a party in Agrabah

102
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,637
A party goin' on now! Gotta
party! Gotta party! Help me!

103
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,194
I can't stop myself!
Somebody rub the lamp!

104
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:50,153
Somebody rub the lamp!
Ah, you know I feel it!

105
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,077
That's enough.

106
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:15,429
Why do you walk in the open
while I suffocate like an animal?

107
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,835
Someone has to keep
a cool head, Sa'luk.

108
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:22,112
Someone will have no head
if this is another wild goose chase.

109
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,357
The oracle is the real thing.

110
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,311
This time I'm sure.

111
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,715
Hello, and welcome to Lifestyles
of the Rich and Magical.

112
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,832
That's right. We're taking you
to the marriage of the millennium.

113
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,076
And who's this coming
on the lovely stretch camel?

114
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:44,875
Oh, it's Cleopatra and Caesar,
and they're bringing a salad.

115
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,718
How wonderful!

116
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,354
Oh, look, there's Osiris.
Oh, Osiris!

117
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,789
Osiris, can we have
a word with you?

118
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:56,072
Oh, no, the crowd is parting.
Who's coming? It's Moses!

119
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:59,749
- And your name is?
- I'm Thor.
- You're Thor?
- Well, it hurts.

120
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,519
Once again, this whole broadcast
has been brought to you by sand!

121
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:05,677
It's everywhere. Get used to it.

122
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,631
Come on. Come on.

123
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,069
I can see fine from back here.

124
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,997
Uh-uh. It's Aladdin.

125
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,873
Look, there's one thing
I get sentimental about...

126
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,434
and I'm sittin' on it.

127
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:22,634
- Huh?
- The loot, monkey. The loot.

128
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:26,196
Bad news, Al. The boutonnieres
clash with the cummerbunds.

129
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:29,232
Genie, isn't it
a little late for that?

130
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,069
What? What are you trying
to say? Out with it! What? What?

131
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,111
They're here.

132
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,549
Oh, no!

133
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,956
I'm late, I'm late
for a very important date.

134
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,433
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.
- Your Highness.

135
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,357
Your Majesty.

136
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:31,669
D-Don't look so solemn, boy.
This is a happy day.

137
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,553
Oh, look. It's a Kodiak moment.

138
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,071
Put that bear outta here.

139
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,953
Ohh! Hmm.

140
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,717
- Wow!
- Oh, yeah!

141
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,150
I never thought
this day would come.

142
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:19,317
Now I'm afraid that it
has come all too soon.

143
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,590
Oh, Father.

144
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:27,073
- You distract the guards.
- Part of your plan?

145
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,873
A large part.

146
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,638
It's time.

147
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,714
It's all so magical.

148
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,796
I'm not gonna cry. I'm not.

149
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,356
Oh, sorry.

150
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:12,959
- Well, we're here.
- Together forever.

151
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,156
Let me be the point man.

152
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,510
I thought the earth wasn't supposed
to move until the honeymoon.

153
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,392
Whoa! Oh, my word!

154
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,112
Stampede!

155
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,480
What is going on here?

156
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:48,117
Come here, monkey boy!
You were almost Dumbo toe jam.

157
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,032
Oh, they trampled the carpet!
That's a little redundant.

158
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,197
So this isn't a bad day
for you, really, is it?

159
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,790
It is an attack.

160
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,758
Not in this palace!

161
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:27,629
I think we're gonna have
a little problem with leaks.

162
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,389
It must be here somewhere.

163
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,715
Meet your match, Zorro!

164
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,752
Good birdie.
Polly want a little--

165
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,111
Say "cracker" and I'll
let you have it on principle!

166
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:00,597
- You have a lot of spirit.
- Ow! Ow! Ow!

167
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,676
And a lot of mouth.

168
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,718
- They fight like demons.
- Worse than demons.

169
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,877
- These are the Forty Thieves.
- Really? I get 39.

170
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,071
Forty.

171
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,111
Where is it?

172
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:44,118
Ah, at last.

173
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,437
- Can I see your invitation?
- Stay out of my way, boy,

174
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:54,199
and you won't get hurt!

175
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:00,830
Fool! You don't stand a chance
against the King of Thieves!

176
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,315
When I get up, I'll bow to you!

177
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,838
Mmm. Huh? Ohh!

178
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,520
That was for ruining my wedding.

179
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:13,030
Huh? Aah!

180
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,720
I guess there's really
no point to this now.

181
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:59,313
Freeze, sandbags!
Don't make me use the other end!

182
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:14,198
Mama always said,
"Magic is as magic does."

183
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,039
Cassim said nothing about
facing the powers of a genie.

184
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:21,517
Get the others out of here.
We'll leave the "king" to his plans.

185
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,270
Where's the King of Thieves?

186
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,433
I'll see you again, boy.

187
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:56,637
Ooh! This is not my fault.

188
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,638
This was not built to code.

189
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,391
Good luck gettin' back
the catering deposit.

190
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:08,318
- Oh, my!
- Fear not, O father of the bride.

191
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:11,637
- We can rebuild!
- Oh, please do.

192
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:14,479
We can't have a wedding
without a pavilion.

193
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:18,559
All right, a wedding pavilion
it is, my man.

194
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:24,120
Hey, I wanna see some resumés
on these guys.

195
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,391
And don't let the one with
the beak near any power tool.

196
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,715
Uh, yes, yes, Genie,
whatever it takes.

197
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:32,912
I am sorry about
all this, Jasmine.

198
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,837
Daughter?

199
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,389
What were they after, the gifts?

200
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:41,308
Not all the gifts. This is what
the King of Thieves wanted.

201
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,831
With all the other great stuff,
why go for this thing?

202
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:49,032
Your question is mine to answer.

203
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,512
The King of Thieves sought my sight
to find the ultimate treasure.

204
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,473
- Did someone say "treasure"?
- Genie?

205
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,398
Oh, it looks like an oracle.

206
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:06,355
I see all that has been
and all that will be.

207
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,029
Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Definitely an
oracle. Tells the future. Uh-oh.

208
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,913
Girlfriend,
where were you registered?

209
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,759
Okay, you know all,
so tell all.

210
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:19,953
Where is the treasure?
You know, the ultimate one?

211
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:24,835
I am bound by the rule of one.
One question, one answer.

212
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,394
I only want one answer!

213
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:31,069
Where is the ultimate treasure?

214
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,873
You have already asked
your one question.

215
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,790
You mean before?
Oh, that wasn't a question.
That was, uh, thinkin' out loud.

216
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,558
Very loud.

217
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:44,309
Aladdin, we could learn anything
about our lives, our future.

218
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,351
You have but to ask.

219
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,438
I know what my future is.
My future is you.

220
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:52,711
But my past is a blank.

221
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:57,072
My mother died when I was just a kid,
and I never even knew my father.

222
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,475
I have no idea
where I come from.

223
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:04,879
Your question is your choice,
but remember the rule of one.
Choose carefully.

224
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,232
Oh, sure, she warns him about
the one question thing. Hey!

225
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:13,717
I don't think you can help me.
My past isn't just one question;
it's a million questions.

226
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:19,039
Ah, but mere questions about your past
can be answered by your father.

227
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,196
My father?

228
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,114
My father is alive?

229
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,070
Abu? Where's Aladdin?

230
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,077
How long has he been up there?

231
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,390
Aladdin?

232
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,750
Are you all right?

233
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,632
- What's wrong?
- I always wanted to know
about my father,

234
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,479
but just now I'm not so sure.

235
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:14,798
What kind of man leaves his son?
Did he even care?

236
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,832
- Maybe I don't want to know.
- Yes, you do.

237
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,554
How can you be so sure?

238
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:23,638
Because I already know him.

239
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,796
Because I know you.

240
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,035
You showed me the world

241
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:34,199
When I was all locked up inside

242
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,754
You reached out your hand

243
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:41,192
And took me on
a magic carpet ride

244
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,470
One look at your smile

245
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,273
And I could see the light

246
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,029
Shining everywhere

247
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:57,077
People like you
don't come out of thin air

248
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,037
Oh, Jasmine.

249
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,355
You don't understand

250
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,632
There is so much
that you don't see

251
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,876
Just think if you can

252
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,118
What growing up
had to be like for me

253
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,470
Your father's a man

254
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,398
Who taught you who you are

255
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:21,717
Mine was never there

256
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:27,392
So how can you say
I don't come out of thin air

257
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,791
There's so much I want to know

258
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,673
You've got the chance to learn

259
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,792
If it means I'd have to go

260
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:44,758
I'll be right here
when you return

261
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,836
- Our wedding can wait
- I love you

262
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,839
- I think it's worth this small delay
- Maybe you're right

263
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,394
And won't it be great

264
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,592
To have your father see
our wedding day

265
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,599
- I've waited so long
to learn the truth
- It isn't too late

266
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:05,874
And now at last
we can finally say

267
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,231
Your father is really there

268
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,670
There's so much
that we might share

269
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,109
And you'll finally learn

270
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:23,591
- You don't come out of thin air
- Don't come out of thin air

271
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:37,079
- Have you chosen your question?
- I have.

272
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,953
Then ask.

273
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,196
Where is my father?

274
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,914
Follow the trail
of the Forty Thieves.

275
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:48,749
Your father is trapped
within their world.

276
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,270
The Forty Thieves? ls he hurt?
How long has he been their prisoner?

277
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:56,916
I'm sorry. I can only
answer one question.

278
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,559
- It's up to me.
- Take as long as you need.

279
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,751
I'll be back in time
for our wedding. I promise.

280
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,995
I should've stayed
with the genie.

281
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,588
Manual labour beats danger
any day.

282
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,433
Good. The trail's still fresh.

283
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,437
- Hyah! Hyah!
- Hyah!
- There.

284
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:36,598
Definitely should've
stayed with the genie.

285
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,755
Shh.

286
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:51,277
Whew. Well, they have
nowhere to go.

287
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,630
- We got 'em trapped.
- We?

288
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,354
They are 40 thieves.

289
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:00,758
We are you, a rug,
a monkey and me.

290
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,350
- Wait, don't count me.
- They're just standing there.

291
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,598
Open sesame!

292
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,310
Hyah!

293
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,671
- Let's move!
- Oh, oh! Aah!

294
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,395
- Whoa!
- Hang on!

295
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,518
I know, Carpet.
It's incredible. Wha--

296
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:20,477
How bad is it?

297
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,115
Yeow!

298
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:34,676
Oh, this is attractive.

299
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,637
Come on.

300
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,757
Hey!

301
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,316
You wanna not hold up traffic?

302
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,273
I wanna get in, get out
and go home.

303
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,631
Actually, I wouldn't mind
skipping right to the "go home."

304
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,557
- We could've had all of
the loot at the wedding,
- Shh!

305
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:12,433
but we followed the King's plan.

306
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:16,673
This is what we have to show
for our trouble in Agrabah.

307
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,597
- Nothing!
- Yeah! I agree.

308
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,599
- This oughta be good.
- Sa'luk is truly ticked.

309
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,872
Your time draws
to a close, Cassim.

310
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,389
Cassim? My father.

311
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:33,479
If you're talking about
spilling my blood, well, I
just don't see that happening.

312
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,353
Then let me open your eyes.

313
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,637
- Huh?
- Run! I've got him.

314
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,677
I'm Aladdin. You're my father!

315
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,592
His father?

316
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:48,314
I don't know
about your father, boy,

317
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:51,796
but I'll send you to meet
your other ancestors.

318
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:56,596
Let him go. The boy is my son.

319
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,439
I gave this dagger
to my wife years ago.

320
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:03,473
I told her to give it
to our newborn son, Aladdin.

321
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,158
It's true?

322
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:09,239
Oh, the boy is the son
of the King of Thieves.

323
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,635
You are the King of Thieves?

324
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,672
Like it or not, boy,
we are blood.

325
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:18,509
Look at you. I thought
I'd never see you again.

326
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,949
Has it been so long?

327
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,799
Blood or mud,
the boy is an intruder,

328
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:26,559
and we have rules
about intruders.

329
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:29,353
- Sa'luk is right.
- He knows our secrets.

330
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,630
- I hate intruders.
- Hey, me too.

331
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,069
He has found our secret lair.

332
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,191
He has seen too much.

333
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,311
He must die.

334
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,556
Yes!

335
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:47,514
- They must all die.
- Die?

336
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,438
He's your son. I'm his friend.

337
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:53,233
Cast a vote for mercy here!

338
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:57,148
Yes, Cassim, mercy
would be so like you.

339
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,475
Soft and weak.

340
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,751
- Maybe Sa'luk should be king.
- Maybe Sa'luk should be king.
- Yes, yes, he should be.

341
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,708
- Kill him.
- Huh?

342
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,079
Or the boy could--

343
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,670
Yes, the boy could-- No.

344
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,756
- What? What? Th-The boy could what?
- Speak.

345
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:25,475
- Nothing. Probably a bad idea.
- Let's hear it!
- No, no, no!

346
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,478
Well, it seems to me that--
Oh, never mind.

347
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:31,239
- What?
- Oh, no, please!

348
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:36,317
The boy could face
the challenge.

349
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,476
- Ahh!
- Oh, that's right, the challenge!

350
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:44,790
That's that. My son
shall face the challenge.

351
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:48,595
And I shall be the one
to test him.

352
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,917
- Yeah!
- A test, huh? Ah, that's not so bad.

353
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:54,349
Maybe it'll be multiple choice.

354
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,789
Escape? Not likely.

355
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,275
Our ride home is grounded,

356
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:14,676
and Al-- well, it's been
nice knowin' him.

357
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:17,997
- What's going on, Dad?
- Oh, the challenge is simple enough.

358
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:21,032
Only one man survives.

359
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:25,718
But you're my son.
You'll be that man.

360
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:29,037
Knock him dead, kid. Seriously.

361
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,476
No!

362
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,831
I thought our side won!

363
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,713
- Look, l-- I-l didn't mean--
- Get him!

364
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,434
Take him to the King.

365
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,518
Look, I don't even
know him, okay?

366
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:56,474
You killed Sa'luk. The code of the Forty
Thieves is very clear on this point.

367
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:01,918
- You're in.
- Hooray! Hooray!

368
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,713
- Congratulations, bub
- You've joined the club

369
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,876
And everybody here agrees

370
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,390
We got the finest blend
of nearly-honest men

371
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:12,556
Welcome to the Forty Thieves

372
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:15,911
A fraternity of thugs
that you can trust

373
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,349
There's nothing up
our 80 sleeves

374
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,597
- Got lots of grub to share
- Pull up an easy chair

375
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:24,393
Welcome to the Forty Thieves

376
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:27,159
Now you get to lie and cheat

377
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:30,033
Never have to brush your teeth

378
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,549
But we always aim to please

379
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:35,638
- Care for one another
- You'll never miss your mother

380
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,399
Oh, I love you guys.

381
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:41,239
Schemin' up a scam
out on the lam

382
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,351
Takin' whatever we please

383
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:46,836
- And if you like to lurk
- You're gonna love this work

384
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,428
Welcome to the Forty Thieves

385
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,918
Welcome to the Forty Thieves

386
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:03,634
Together we're the perfect team

387
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,228
Larceny is in the genes

388
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:09,238
Dare to share the family dream

389
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:13,273
Live a life of leisure
Countin' all your treasure

390
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:18,230
As an honorary member
of the gang

391
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:21,272
That no one alive ever leaves

392
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:24,392
- You gotta snatch and sneak
- Or else your future's bleak

393
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:27,512
We got a lifetime contract
that you're bound to keep

394
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:31,076
You wanna save your skin
You'd better fit right in

395
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,589
Well, well, welcome to the--
Well, well, welcome to the--

396
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:36,553
Forty

397
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:41,470
Thieves

398
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,709
Boy. And I thought I was blue.

399
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:20,275
You would know if Aladdin
is in trouble, wouldn't you?

400
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:23,710
I thought he'd be back by now.

401
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,398
AI will be back.

402
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,713
Listen to Genie, dear.
Genie knows.

403
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:40,470
You've got to get your mind off
this incessant waiting.

404
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:43,034
Here's a sure-fire way to cheer
up a bummed-out bride-to-be.

405
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:46,072
A heaping helping
of matrimonial magic.

406
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:55,840
Hey, that's-a no good.
What the wedding needs is a theme.

407
00:33:55,960 --> 00:34:00,078
- It needs a groom too, but
let's work with what we have.
- Genie!

408
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:03,829
It's a joke. I do that.

409
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:07,475
Okay, let's see. This'll
be the second wedding for both of you.

410
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:11,957
I'm thinking we need something
a little more simple, a little
more elegant and less grey.

411
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:16,471
Did it, done it, own it.
I'm gonna throw some colours
at ya-- mauve, teal and salmon.

412
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:20,195
What do you like besides
the salmon? Okay, Madonna!

413
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,949
Don't keep it. Just put that
in the mix. Wink. Okay.

414
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:27,436
I see lasers! It's a miracle!

415
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:30,597
He believes! He believes!

416
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:33,598
- Thank you very much.
- I don't think so.

417
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,791
Tres gauche, right?

418
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:41,109
Hmm, maybe you--
you could elope.

419
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:43,470
No, you "cantaloupe."
But oh, "honeydew"!

420
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:49,073
I don't know whether to
put it under props or produce.

421
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:52,875
Please don't squeeze the tyres. They're
not ripe. And how about that gown?

422
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,912
Whether you're dancing with dwarfs
or simply biting the apple,

423
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:58,713
it says,
"I'm a princess for now."

424
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:02,037
- Uh, Genie.
- Hey, it's synergy.

425
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,674
The marketing guys are very
excited. It tests really well.

426
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,951
Thank you, Genie.
I'm sure it will be wonderful.

427
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:12,033
And thanks for cheering me up.

428
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:16,438
I'm sure Ali Baba and the boy
are on the road to Agrabah right
now. Isn't that right, Bob?

429
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:20,348
That's right, Bing. How 'bout
this town? ls it wild or what?

430
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,313
It's like one giant sand trap,
and me without my wedgie.

431
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,318
Hey, let's give a big hand
for Brooke Shields.

432
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,312
I find my son
and lose my enemy.

433
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,556
You did your old man proud,
Aladdin.

434
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,591
- I was just trying to stay alive.
- Huh!

435
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,995
If you didn't fight,
you would've been killed.

436
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:40,270
So says the code
of the Forty Thieves.

437
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,995
Does this code have any rules
that don't end in death?

438
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:46,350
It's a strict code.

439
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:50,871
But there is one thing that I added.
We never hurt the innocent.

440
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,956
Uh, for future reference,

441
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:56,390
I'm as innocent
as the day I was hatched.

442
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:59,432
Oh, brother!

443
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,551
My men don't even know
about this place.

444
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,950
Listen, boy,
there is a treasure,

445
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,798
the ultimate treasure.

446
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:15,151
Compared to this, a pharaoh's
tomb is a pauper's grave,

447
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:18,113
a sultan's fortune
nothing but lunch money.

448
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:21,232
And I am this close to it.

449
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:24,591
That's tantalizingly close.

450
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:28,554
But it's on an island that is
never in the same place twice.

451
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:32,593
- The Vanishing lsle.
- That would be a problem.

452
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:36,030
- What is this ultimate treasure?
- The big one, boy.

453
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:39,072
The Hand of Midas.

454
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:42,715
- It's just a myth.
- It's not a myth, boy!

455
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:47,038
It was once right here.
Look, there's your proof.

456
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:50,197
From stern to stem,
every piece of rigging,

457
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:54,871
every peg and board,
all of it, solid gold!

458
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,797
Ooh!

459
00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:00,310
Adopt me, daddy-o!

460
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:04,433
- Touched by the Hand of Midas.
- And sunk by it.

461
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:08,269
Oh, you don't understand. You don't know
what it's like to have nothing.

462
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,676
To stare up at the palace
and know you deserve more.

463
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,317
To be called "street rat."

464
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,516
Yes, I do.

465
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:22,189
I knew exactly what I wanted
for my family-- the best.

466
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:25,153
I couldn't give up
and go back empty-handed.

467
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:28,750
But the weeks turned into months,
and the months turned into years.

468
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:34,074
I came back to Agrabah
one night,

469
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:38,193
but I couldn't find my wife
or my son.

470
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:42,598
I thought my family
was lost forever.

471
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:47,794
At that moment, I would've traded
anything to get your mother back.

472
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:51,674
We never wanted gold.
We wanted you.

473
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,952
I wanted a father. I still do.

474
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:59,993
Come to my wedding. This time,
you have an invitation.

475
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:02,759
Aladdin, l-l just don't know.

476
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,440
Dad, I'm not going back
to Agrabah until morning.

477
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,835
At least think about it?

478
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:14,349
Aladdin may never understand,
but it just wouldn't work.

479
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,436
I don't belong in his world.

480
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:20,348
The oracle doesn't belong
in his world either.

481
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:24,029
It belongs in the hands of two
enterprising treasure hunters:

482
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,674
you and me.

483
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:30,110
The oracle. It's probably
just another dead end.

484
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:33,596
It works! That's how
the kid found you.

485
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:37,235
- It knows everything.
- Everything?

486
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,476
And I know where
they stashed it.

487
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:42,512
Cassim, we are talking about...

488
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:45,552
the wedding of your only son.

489
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:50,310
It's a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity.

490
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:52,749
How can I pass it up?

491
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:01,397
- Captain, over here.
- Show yourself!

492
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:04,876
You're alone. Good.

493
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,515
So you are the one with information
about the Forty Thieves?

494
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,712
What would you say
if I handed you...

495
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,751
the King of Thieves?

496
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:16,633
I'd say, "What in it for you?"

497
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:20,639
I'll just sleep better knowing
that he's off the streets...

498
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,876
and on the executioner's block.

499
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,993
Everyone knows that the King
of Thieves cannot be caught.

500
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:29,588
What miracle do you possess?

501
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:33,599
Two words that will make you
Agrabah's greatest hero.

502
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:36,109
Open sesame.

503
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,355
- Hop on, Dad.
- Oh, no.

504
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:46,553
It's a rug. You sweep dirt under it.
You don't fly on it. At least I don't.

505
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:50,150
- Don't be afraid. It's fun.
- I am not afraid!

506
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:55,638
- Now get off that thing
before you break your neck.
- I trust Carpet with my life.

507
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:59,639
- Give him time. He'll come around.
- We'll take horses.

508
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:04,117
Horses were good enough
for my father and his father before him,

509
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,674
and they were always
good enough for me.

510
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,268
- He sounds like a father, all right.
- Uh-huh.

511
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:15,677
Whoa! This is the spot, men.

512
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:21,239
- But there is nothing here.
- Now. But watch.

513
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:26,551
Open caraway!

514
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,756
There is still nothing here.

515
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:36,236
When I get ahold
of that no good--

516
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:41,434
But I thought you said
it was "open sesame."

517
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,835
Easy. Whoa. Whoa! Hey, hey!

518
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:57,552
- Looks like Genie has everything ready.
- Yeah. Uh-huh.

519
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:01,559
Genie? You have a genie? Have
you used all three wishes yet?

520
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:05,229
Oh, please, don't go into it.
It's just too painful.

521
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:08,591
Oh, Al, you're back,
and your front!

522
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:11,314
- You're both here!
- That's great, Genie. Uh--
- Security's tight.

523
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,715
No big crowd.
Immediate family only.

524
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:17,913
- Perfect, because this is my--
- No lowlifes this time, other
than the parrot, of course.

525
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:20,634
Observe.

526
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:29,792
You have violated the perimeter
of the Aladdin and Jasmine wedding.

527
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,036
Prepare to be vaporized.
Thank you.

528
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:36,116
Armed and dangerous.

529
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,913
I'd like to see one of those
Forty Thieves get within
an inch of your wedding.

530
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:41,998
Allow me to introduce--

531
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:44,759
The King of Thieves.

532
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,952
- All units, we have a code red.
- Code red! Code red!
- Code red! Code red!

533
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:50,071
Code red! Code red!
Code red! Code red!

534
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:53,078
Code red! Code red!

535
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:57,398
Code red! Code red! Code red!
Code red! Code red!

536
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,988
Come on, boys. Follow me.

537
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:06,108
- Cavalry, forward!
- Code red! Code red! Code red!

538
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:10,199
- Geronimo!
- Arapaho!
- Navajo!
- Pocahontas.

539
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,470
- Code red! Code red! Code red!
- C-C-C-C-C-Code red! C-C-C-C-C--

540
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:16,275
- Code red!
- Do not attempt to move, or
we'll be shooting ourselves.

541
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:20,188
- Genie!
- Back off, Al. This creep's got a
yellow sheet as long as my arm.

542
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,595
Genie, meet my dad.

543
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:28,511
Stand down, men.
Smoke 'em if you got 'em.

544
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:31,029
If you're Al's dad...

545
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:33,628
and the King of Thieves,

546
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,957
- I just want to know one thing.
- Yeah?

547
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:39,799
Will you be having
the chicken or the sea bass?

548
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:43,310
Come on, Dad. I can't wait
for you to meet Jasmine and the Sultan.

549
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:47,115
Ahem, Al. Don't you think we oughta
lose the "Agrabah's Most Wanted" Iook?

550
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:51,199
- What's wrong with the way I look?
- When you're here, you're
not the King of Thieves.

551
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:53,390
You're my dad.

552
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:57,559
Mmm, I had more practise
being the King of Thieves.

553
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:00,035
Oh, come on.
Enough of this dark past.

554
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,913
Let's roll out something
a little new.

555
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:05,395
It's a big, bright
beautiful future

556
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,954
Thank your lucky stars
you're alive

557
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:10,958
You got someone special
to talk to

558
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:13,389
A friend that you
can trust for life

559
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,909
You've been on your own
with no family ties

560
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:18,634
But those solo days are done

561
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:23,231
You'll be two of a kind
spending quality time together

562
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:25,920
As father and son

563
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:28,429
Building model ships

564
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,994
Takin' fishin' trips

565
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:33,111
Workin' hand in hand

566
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:37,395
Painting the palace
Mowin' the sand

567
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:41,593
First and ten to go,
with your daddy-o!

568
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:44,837
Once you break the ice

569
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,952
You can postulate
paternal advice

570
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:52,790
I see you're travelling at the speed of
light. That's the theory of relatives.

571
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:55,514
It's a fine
"fantabulous" future

572
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:58,029
I see fruit on the family tree

573
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:00,594
You'll be great
as a grumpy old grandpa

574
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:03,314
Bouncin' babies on your knee

575
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,715
You can fall asleep
on the comfy couch

576
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:08,673
After playin' one-on-one

577
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,792
Dreaming back to back
that you walloped the Shaq

578
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:14,593
Together as father and son

579
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:18,319
May be a bumpy ride

580
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:21,716
We'll make it side by side

581
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:24,513
Good afternoon.
I'll be your travel guide!

582
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:26,995
Move over, laddie
Make room for Daddy

583
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:29,554
Got a whole new shoulder
to cry on

584
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:32,274
Take a chance now
Give it a spin

585
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,834
You've had chums
for pallin' around with

586
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:37,554
But you never had
a friend like him

587
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:40,114
Put your checkered past
behind you now

588
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,834
No more living on the run

589
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,713
Face the big, bright
beautiful future

590
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:50,038
- Together
- Together
- Together
- Together

591
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:53,391
As father and son

592
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:01,389
My boy Aladdin must be born
under a lucky star...

593
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:03,636
to find such a treasure.

594
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:06,672
You are most definitely
Aladdin's father.

595
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:10,236
-And I have the DNA to prove it.
-Oh, it must have been dreadful.

596
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:13,397
- Trapped by the Forty Thieves.
- Uh-oh.

597
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:15,988
I try to block out the memories.

598
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:19,430
Say no more. Not another word
on the subject.

599
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:22,518
Yes, let's turn our attention
to happier thoughts.

600
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:26,030
- The blessed union of our children.
- Indeed.

601
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,957
It worked, Genie.
They love him.

602
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:30,992
It was the hat. Nothing does
the trick like a smart chapeau.

603
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:33,554
- It's more than that.
- Ah, to be back among
civilized people.

604
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:38,151
- Back among family.
- All he needed was a second chance.
- It's a miracle.

605
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:40,999
- You'll pay for this!
- You traitor!
- You sold us out!

606
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:45,352
- My nose!
- He's not in there!

607
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:47,516
You didn't capture
the King of Thieves?

608
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:50,200
Because he was not
at the hideout!

609
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:52,629
He had to be there.
Where else would he be?

610
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:55,797
- Uh, apologies, Captain Rasoul.
- What?
- What?

611
00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:00,118
Well, the Sultan said
he won't be able to sentence
your prisoners until tomorrow.

612
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:03,630
What's more important
than sentencing my prisoners?

613
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:08,311
Why, the wedding. Princess Jasmine and
Aladdin are finally getting married.

614
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:11,910
Aladdin? You didn't capture
Aladdin with the others?

615
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:14,759
Why would he be with
the Forty Thieves?

616
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:18,873
Because his father is
the King of Thieves!

617
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:24,629
Ooh, where can he be?
Oh, I do hope nothing's wrong.

618
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:27,399
Perhaps we should dispatch
a search party, hmm?

619
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:31,149
Now, Father, I'm sure
he's on his way.

620
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:35,114
- Where is he?
- Hakuna matata.

621
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:38,437
Whoa! I was having
an out-of-movie experience.

622
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:42,269
My guess is he wants
to make an entrance.

623
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:50,913
Here's the monkey's lock picks.
You know how to use 'em?

624
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:54,999
I promise you, bird,
after this I go straight.

625
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:57,236
Straight to the dungeon.

626
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:04,788
We've been expecting you.

627
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:19,078
Do you think something is wrong?

628
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,760
- Genie, can you find him?
- I'll sniff him out.

629
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:29,434
I need a scrap of his clothes
or a lock of his hair or a shoe.

630
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:32,950
A shoe's good.

631
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:36,914
- Huh?
- Ohh!
- Rasoul, what is the meaning of this?

632
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:40,430
Your Majesty, meet
the King of Thieves.

633
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:42,835
- Dad!
- We seized him in the treasury.

634
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:46,714
- He was after this again.
- No.

635
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:49,434
And this is his accomplice.

636
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:51,676
Big misunderstanding!

637
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:55,031
It's a slap on the wrist and,
uh, community service kind of thing.

638
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:57,355
Now I know why
you really came back.

639
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:03,358
Your father is the leader
of the Forty Thieves?

640
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:06,313
B-B-B-But this is most p--

641
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:09,477
Aladdin, did you know?

642
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:12,478
I thought I could change him.
I had to try.

643
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:16,513
You can change my clothes, Aladdin.
You can't change who I am.

644
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:20,633
And the law is crystal clear
on what we must now do.

645
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:23,991
Father, isn't there
another way?

646
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:28,716
I'm afraid there is not. Take
the prisoners to the dungeon.

647
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:31,035
- Dungeon?
- For life.

648
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:34,869
Life?

649
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,390
There are some wishes that
even I can't make come true.

650
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:48,910
The oracle was right. My dad was trapped
in the world of the Forty Thieves.

651
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:52,635
Trapped by his own greed. I was
so stupid to think I could change him.

652
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:55,832
Trying to show him a better life
wasn't stupid, Al.

653
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:57,996
Leaving him alone with the
parrot, that was stupid.

654
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:01,430
Everything was perfect
before he came into my life.

655
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:04,472
I just want things
the way they were.

656
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:06,670
Genie, I need
my father's clothes.

657
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:10,554
A-A-A-Al, what, did you
wrap the turban too tight?

658
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:15,071
Come on! Why you wanna dress
in the King of Thieves ensemble?

659
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:17,998
Might I suggest something
that doesn't actually say, "Arrest me!"

660
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:20,953
It fits. Good.

661
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:24,959
I'm seeing-- I'm seeing nothing
for your future if you dress like this!

662
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:30,074
I'm breaking my father out
of that dungeon. The guards
will never know I was there.

663
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:34,830
Tonight the King of Thieves will
make his most miraculous escape ever.

664
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:37,269
Out of my life!

665
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:39,789
It's the cape talking, isn't it?

666
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:05,038
Since he's captured the King of
Thieves, there's no living with Rasoul.

667
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:09,392
Well, it wasn't exactly easy
living with him before.

668
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:25,158
- Who?
- I've come to say goodbye.

669
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:27,510
- Why are you--
- We don't have much time.

670
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:30,234
While the guards chase me,
you get out.

671
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,954
- I can't let you--
- Forget it.

672
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:35,036
They can't catch me.

673
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:39,513
He even sounds like me.

674
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:44,398
When the Sultan gives me my due,

675
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:48,832
I'll put the good word in
for you, the little people who--

676
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:53,391
It can't be.

677
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:00,117
He was here. I know it.

678
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:07,432
- The King of Thieves!
- No man could've escaped that cell.

679
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:11,951
He-- He isn't a man, I say.
He's a demon!

680
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:15,436
I want him, dead or alive.

681
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,709
Surround the block!
He's close. I can feel it.

682
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:26,071
- Well, which way did he go?
- I don't see him.

683
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:28,316
Look over there. Hurry!

684
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:39,871
There! The King of Thieves
on the roof!

685
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,355
Get up there! Now! Now! Now!

686
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:46,671
- Found him!
- Lost him.

687
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,116
- Which way did he go?
- I heard him over there.
- Over there!

688
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:55,037
- Over there!
- There!

689
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:01,997
Gotcha!

690
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:07,870
The King of Thieves.

691
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:12,118
Your charmed life is over,
Your Majesty!

692
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:16,749
You!

693
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:19,314
Yes.

694
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:22,671
Well, I guess I'll have
to settle for the Prince of Thieves.

695
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:26,634
We shall see if the Sultan
wants you in his family now.

696
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:32,716
Keep your hands off my son!

697
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:36,958
- Dad?
- Hurry, son. We must move.

698
00:52:56,520 --> 00:53:00,479
- Did we lose him?
- I don't know, but I did
lose my lunch back there.

699
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:03,194
They won't be able to pick up
our trail 'til daylight.

700
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:06,232
By then, we'll be
long gone from Agrabah.

701
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:14,952
I'm sorry for what you lost.

702
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:18,629
But you can't go back now.
You know that. What are you doing?

703
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:21,593
I'm not going with you. I can't.

704
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:26,316
Well, you can't go back.
The moment they saw your face,
your life in Agrabah was over.

705
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:29,113
I have to go back.
Jasmine is there.

706
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:31,993
Kid, it's over.
You're a criminal now.

707
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:35,556
I won't do what he did.
I won't run away.

708
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:39,514
- I never ran away
from anything in my life.
- You ran away from your family.

709
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:44,156
I told you what happened. What else
could I do? What else can you do?

710
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:46,874
The right thing.
You should take this back.

711
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:52,120
- You can't!
- I won't walk out on Jasmine.

712
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:55,949
- Aladdin.
- I'm your son, but I can't
live your life.

713
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:58,310
Al, they'll lock ya up.

714
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:00,476
If there's a punishment,
I'll take it.

715
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:03,956
- So be it.
- We have the oracle!

716
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:09,154
- The treasure's just waiting for us.
- The oracle?

717
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:13,910
- I had nothing left to lose.
- Yes, you did.

718
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:19,157
It was supposed to be
a father-son outing.

719
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:23,035
- Go with him, lago.
- What?

720
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:25,071
You mean it? Really?

721
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:27,031
Go.

722
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:29,799
Good luck, kid.

723
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:43,152
From 40 thieves down to 7.
What are we to do?

724
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:47,034
How did they find us? How did
they learn the magic words?

725
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:53,630
- Another raid?
- Not again.

726
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:55,751
It is a good day to die.

727
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:59,031
Or to come back from the dead.

728
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:03,676
- Sa'luk?
- You're alive?
- Impossible.

729
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:06,394
I'm a survivor, like all of you.

730
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:08,476
No thanks to Cassim.

731
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:12,479
- The King?
- You saw him?
- What's he want us to do now?

732
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:15,672
He wants you to rot
in the palace dungeon.

733
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:19,349
Bah! The King of Thieves
is loyal to the end.

734
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:21,596
- Pushovers!
- Ouch!

735
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:24,792
He betrayed you, sold you out.

736
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:29,436
You have always hated the King.
Why should we believe you?

737
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:32,950
How do you think the guard
got the magic words?

738
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:35,992
He told him the magic words?

739
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:40,910
- I don't believe it.
- Me neither.

740
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:43,952
You've forgotten what life
was like before Cassim.

741
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:49,113
I remember a time
when crime was sublime

742
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:51,959
There was plenty of loot
in the lair

743
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:54,833
We'd plunder and pillage
and ransack a village

744
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:57,394
With nary a worry or care

745
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:00,159
Then along came this king
with his soft-hearted dream

746
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:02,748
But he ratted us out in the end

747
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:05,758
So rally the troops
We were meant to regroup

748
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:08,110
And return to our roots
once again

749
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:11,312
Are you in or out

750
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:14,079
Gotta know without a doubt

751
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:16,794
I'm the one you need
for a dirty deed

752
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:19,354
I'm the best
Success is guaranteed

753
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:22,040
Are you men or mice

754
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:24,594
Take a slice of my advice

755
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:27,473
You want a fearless leader
One that's strong and stout

756
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:30,398
Better vote for me
Are you in or out

757
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:35,554
- We used to be smart
- Yes, horrendously heartless

758
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:38,399
In a ravaging raid
we were rough

759
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:40,875
We knew that we had to
be blissfully bad

760
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,355
Then Cassim brought
this sensitive stuff

761
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:46,233
And we strayed from the path
of our rigorous wrath

762
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:48,794
- Now we're taking a bath in the dust
- Huh?

763
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:51,718
But we'll reclaim our winnings
Our humble beginnings

764
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:55,150
In turmoil and torture we trust

765
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:58,556
Are you in or out

766
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:01,148
Double-crossers or devout

767
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:03,953
Put your faith in me
Pretty soon you'll see

768
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:06,548
I'm the prince of generosity

769
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:09,274
Are you foe or friend

770
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:11,675
Here's the path I recommend

771
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:14,394
You wanna ride to fame
I've got the fastest route

772
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:17,432
What's it gonna be
Are you in or out

773
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:22,872
We'll go robbing
in all the right places

774
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,514
From Agrabah dunes to Paris

775
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:28,029
Imagine the fear on their faces

776
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:31,277
When we drop by
for cookies and tea

777
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:34,392
Come along, boys. Follow me!

778
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:37,239
Are you in or out

779
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:40,033
- If you're with me give a shout
- Yeah!

780
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:42,720
I'll lead you all the way
into the glory days

781
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:45,354
We'll begin a life of crime
that pays

782
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:47,675
Are you out or in

783
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:50,394
Make your choice now
Sink or swim

784
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:53,193
You can stick with me
or stay behind and pout

785
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:55,550
What's it gonna be

786
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:58,194
Consider carefully

787
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:00,231
Are you in

788
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:04,319
Or out

789
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:10,238
I know the treasure's limitless,

790
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:13,272
but I'm not crazy
about a 40-way split.

791
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:15,595
If it was just, uh, you and me--

792
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:18,075
I would never cut my men
out of the deal.

793
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:21,033
They're my family,
my only family.

794
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:23,116
I can always count on them.

795
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:35,751
I'm home!

796
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:52,038
Why don't they
look happy to see you?

797
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:55,835
We are. We're thrilled.

798
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:06,149
- Hurry, little friend.
- I'm wriggling. I'm wriggling.

799
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:11,434
I am growing impatient, Cassim.
Ask the question.

800
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:14,313
- We must be, uh--
- Just a little further.

801
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:16,635
Further out to sea.

802
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:20,309
- No. Ask it now!
- Now's good.

803
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:24,479
Where can we find
the Hand of Midas?

804
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:34,358
The Vanishing lsle
will appear at dawn.

805
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:38,155
I will show you the way!

806
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:40,635
There's your setting, Captain.

807
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:54,591
Frankly, my boy, your actions
were most disappointing.

808
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:57,473
It is tragic, Your Highness,
but the street rat...

809
00:59:57,600 --> 01:00:00,751
has obviously followed
in his father's footsteps.

810
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:04,350
Aladdin is a criminal.

811
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:07,472
I object, Your Honour.

812
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:11,350
I object to that
outrageous statement...

813
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:14,995
and I object to a tertiary
character having any lines
during my big courtroom scene.

814
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:18,317
Here, take this to
a higher court. Ciao!

815
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:21,000
Your Honour, if I may enter
a plea of insanity,

816
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:23,873
because I'm crazy
about this kid.

817
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:27,310
Genie, I can handle this myself.

818
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:30,671
Sultan, I convinced my dad
to come here.

819
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:33,439
It was my fault.

820
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:36,154
I would have been better off
if I had never known him.

821
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:38,748
Aladdin, you found your father,

822
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:41,758
a father who risked his freedom
to see your wedding.

823
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:45,236
And you risked everything
to help him,

824
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:48,272
just as I would for my father.

825
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:51,597
Your father. Uh-- Oh, yeah.

826
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:53,836
Uh, well-- Uh--

827
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:58,317
Aladdin, I could not overlook
your father's crimes,

828
01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:00,476
but what you have done,

829
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:03,751
well, you did it out of love.

830
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:08,317
And you came back to take
responsibility for your actions.

831
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:11,671
Let us put
this matter behind us.

832
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:17,239
I believe we have postponed
the wedding long enough.

833
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:22,036
Good call! Okay, let's give a big hand
for the wise and generous Sultan! Yes!

834
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:31,799
- Al's-- dad-- Sa'luk--
- Just take a deep breath, lago.

835
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:35,913
- Now, what about Aladdin's father?
- It's Sa'luk, the guy AI beat.

836
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:40,477
He's not beat. He's back,
and he's got Cassim.

837
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:44,149
That's his problem. He chose
to go back to that life.

838
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:48,956
Al, I know your dad made
a lot of bad choices, but that
doesn't mean you have to.

839
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:52,595
He is your father.
How can you do anything else?

840
01:01:55,600 --> 01:01:58,239
I'm being as stubborn as he was.

841
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:02,035
Show me the way.

842
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:16,875
Yeah.

843
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:29,750
You have arrived.

844
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:36,591
- Help!
- Where is it?

845
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:39,109
- I see nothing.
- Nothing but fog.

846
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:42,471
- I've had enough of your trickery!
- No, this is it.

847
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:45,751
The Vanishing lsle. Watch.

848
01:02:56,760 --> 01:02:58,557
Look out!

849
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:39,153
- The Vanishing lsle.
- On the back of a giant turtle.

850
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:43,319
And never in the same place
twice. Let's get closer.

851
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:55,639
Time to rock and roll, dude!

852
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:18,238
Now I am here. I am here.

853
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:23,953
- Huh?
- How 'bout a packet of Nutty Buddies?

854
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:30,388
- Genie, we need a distraction.
- Survey says,

855
01:04:30,520 --> 01:04:33,990
"Show me turtle"!

856
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:39,191
Boom! Another fake blow
to the head! Boom!

857
01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:42,869
Oh, no, he's got him in the half nelson.
Now he's got him in the full nelson!

858
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,309
Oh, no! The dreaded
Ozzie Nelson!

859
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:48,318
Rick, boys, maybe you wanna
come over here and see what's happening?

860
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:51,193
He's comin' in quick.
Oh, no, he's up! He's down.

861
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:53,880
And he's actually
inside the turtle.

862
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,719
We'll be right back
after a brief message.

863
01:04:58,240 --> 01:05:00,037
Tickle, tickle, tickle!

864
01:05:08,120 --> 01:05:12,159
It took me years to find my father.
I'm not losing him again.

865
01:05:19,640 --> 01:05:22,916
- You came to help me?
- How could I do anything else?

866
01:05:24,680 --> 01:05:27,353
Now, let's get that
treasure of yours.

867
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:38,070
Amazing!

868
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:49,517
There!

869
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:54,869
Whoa.

870
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:59,471
- Feels like Genie got carried away.
- No! It's the Vanishing lsle.

871
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:02,592
The turtle is diving.
We must climb higher!

872
01:06:15,240 --> 01:06:17,037
We're almost there!

873
01:06:17,160 --> 01:06:20,869
Don't you see, Aladdin?
We were meant to do this together.

874
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:22,433
Come on!

875
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:02,318
Pity I didn't find this place
years ago.

876
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:06,228
This would be much easier
if I were much younger.

877
01:07:07,640 --> 01:07:09,471
Aladdin!

878
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:22,392
See? It pays to have
a junior partner.

879
01:07:22,520 --> 01:07:25,114
Be careful. Don't touch
the golden hand.

880
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:36,155
Heads up.

881
01:07:49,960 --> 01:07:53,589
The Hand of Midas!

882
01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:20,629
Time to go, Aladdin!

883
01:08:23,160 --> 01:08:26,038
Nobody's going anywhere.

884
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:30,119
Give the Hand of Midas to me,
Cassim, or your son dies.

885
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:34,392
-Sa'luk, your battle is with me!
-Don't worry, Dad. I can take him alone.

886
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:37,318
But you're not alone,
not any more.

887
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:39,874
You want the Hand of Midas,
Sa'luk?

888
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,389
Take it!

889
01:08:52,440 --> 01:08:55,910
The Hand of Midas is mine!

890
01:08:56,040 --> 01:08:59,589
And also, the life of your brat.

891
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:05,034
What are you staring at?

892
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:07,990
Oh. No! No!

893
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:09,917
No! No!

894
01:09:31,240 --> 01:09:35,119
Hurry, son.
We're running out of time.

895
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:53,757
Come on, Dad. You can do it.

896
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:58,237
Yes. But it would be
a lot easier without this.

897
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:14,672
After all these years,
you finally have your treasure.

898
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:17,678
This thing? No.

899
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:20,792
This wretched thing almost
cost me the ultimate treasure.

900
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:26,233
It's you, son.
You are my ultimate treasure.

901
01:10:26,360 --> 01:10:29,238
I'm just sorry it took me
this long to realize it.

902
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:34,388
The Hand of Midas can take its
curse to the bottom of the sea!

903
01:10:45,080 --> 01:10:47,992
It's gold. It's turned
everything to solid gold.

904
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:52,911
Oh, we are sinking!

905
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:05,111
I didn't see where they went,
and they could be anywhere!

906
01:11:05,240 --> 01:11:08,038
There they are.

907
01:11:08,160 --> 01:11:10,754
Get up here, you blasted rug!

908
01:11:13,720 --> 01:11:17,599
- You actually trust this thing?
- With my life, son.

909
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:25,948
Genie!

910
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:41,911
- Genie!
- Present!

911
01:11:42,040 --> 01:11:45,635
Let's go home. We have
some unfinished business.

912
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:14,231
Yes!

913
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:44,793
Out in the open? No mask?
Pretty risky, if you ask me.

914
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:48,913
Even a wanted man can risk a bit
to see his own son's wedding.

915
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:52,953
So, you little turkey,
come to say goodbye?

916
01:12:53,080 --> 01:12:55,514
Nah, I already said
my goodbyes.

917
01:12:55,640 --> 01:13:00,794
Of course, the monkey had
to cry, and that got me goin'.

918
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:04,151
- You're not gonna live in the palace?
- With the newlyweds?

919
01:13:04,280 --> 01:13:08,796
It'll be all lovey-dovey.
I'd just as soon keep my will to live.

920
01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:11,036
Well, I don't know
where I'm going,

921
01:13:11,160 --> 01:13:14,550
but you are welcome
to come along for the ride.

922
01:13:14,680 --> 01:13:16,796
You're a good guy, Cassim.

923
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:21,038
But not too good.

924
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:26,872
So it goes short and sweet
They were wed down the street

925
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:30,117
May their marriage
be truly blessed

926
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:33,277
Happy end to the tale
And tomorrow's a sale

927
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:36,392
So I'd better go home and rest

928
01:13:36,520 --> 01:13:39,671
Here's a kiss and a hug
Sure you don't need a rug

929
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:42,314
I assure you the price is right

930
01:13:42,440 --> 01:13:46,353
Well, Salaam, worthy friend
Come back soon, that's the end

931
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:48,630
'Til another

932
01:13:48,760 --> 01:14:00,479
