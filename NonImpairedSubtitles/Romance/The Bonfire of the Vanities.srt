1
00:01:34,612 --> 00:01:39,242
Fallow arriving, area A. Do you copy?

2
00:01:44,892 --> 00:01:47,042
Hi, Mr. Fallow. Welcome.

3
00:01:49,492 --> 00:01:51,881
Hi, so nice to see you!

4
00:01:55,972 --> 00:01:57,200
Careful with that!

5
00:01:57,292 --> 00:01:59,522
We're in a bit of a rush...

6
00:01:59,772 --> 00:02:01,842
...so let's hop on the cart and get going.

7
00:02:01,932 --> 00:02:04,002
There are a lot of people waiting for you.

8
00:02:04,092 --> 00:02:06,287
We're so honored to have you.

9
00:02:06,492 --> 00:02:09,928
This is really an historic occasion, Peter.

10
00:02:15,132 --> 00:02:18,010
Mr. Fallow, I'd like
to take this private moment...

11
00:02:18,292 --> 00:02:21,011
...to tell you how much I admire your book.

12
00:02:21,372 --> 00:02:24,250
When Faulkner was asked
to recommend three novels, he said:

13
00:02:24,332 --> 00:02:26,687
"<i>Anna Karenina</i>, <i>Anna Karenina</i>,
<i>Anna Karenina</i>."

14
00:02:26,772 --> 00:02:30,287
Today, he'd say:
"<i>The Real McCoy and the Forgotten Lamb</i>.

15
00:02:30,492 --> 00:02:34,121
"<i>The Real McCoy and the Forgotten Lamb</i>,
<i>The Real McCoy and</i>..."

16
00:02:35,292 --> 00:02:38,443
I know you've heard it a million times...

17
00:02:39,212 --> 00:02:43,683
...but the scene where the mayor is hit
in the head with the mayonnaise jar...

18
00:02:44,332 --> 00:02:46,243
Well, to be continued.

19
00:02:48,732 --> 00:02:50,290
Right this way.

20
00:02:57,652 --> 00:02:58,846
I've got Mr. Fallow.

21
00:03:05,452 --> 00:03:08,046
Get away!
This should never have happened.

22
00:03:08,132 --> 00:03:09,406
I'm so sorry.

23
00:03:12,972 --> 00:03:14,883
Right this way, Mr. Fallow.

24
00:03:15,212 --> 00:03:18,409
We're just going through these two doors.

25
00:03:19,692 --> 00:03:21,284
We're on our way.

26
00:03:21,452 --> 00:03:24,649
But I must say, if I may quote you...

27
00:03:26,732 --> 00:03:28,962
Look at all the busy bees.

28
00:03:33,772 --> 00:03:35,569
If I may quote you...

29
00:03:36,012 --> 00:03:39,049
..."How in the name of God...
Who in the name of God...

30
00:03:39,212 --> 00:03:42,761
"...would bring a half-eaten jar
of mayonnaise to a public meeting?"

31
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:43,961
Ambassador!

32
00:03:44,052 --> 00:03:48,170
I'm Charles Buchanan. This is my wife,
Stephanie, and my daughter.

33
00:03:48,372 --> 00:03:51,045
Mr. Fallow, I read your book 15 times.

34
00:03:51,252 --> 00:03:56,201
Next year, next year I'm going
to take a course in it.

35
00:03:57,012 --> 00:03:59,082
We're going to go up by ourselves.

36
00:04:03,252 --> 00:04:04,685
Are you hungry?

37
00:04:06,572 --> 00:04:09,962
That's salmon, but I don't think
you should touch that.

38
00:04:14,292 --> 00:04:17,762
Mr. Fallow, it's such an honor
to finally meet you.

39
00:04:18,092 --> 00:04:19,730
Oh, my God!

40
00:04:20,012 --> 00:04:21,923
Oh, my God!

41
00:04:22,292 --> 00:04:24,169
We are running a bit late.

42
00:04:24,252 --> 00:04:26,766
I don't know what to say. Let me see...

43
00:04:26,932 --> 00:04:28,843
- What's your name?
- Suzanne.

44
00:04:28,932 --> 00:04:29,921
Are you married?

45
00:04:31,212 --> 00:04:32,486
Excuse me!

46
00:04:40,372 --> 00:04:41,771
Animals!

47
00:04:46,612 --> 00:04:48,648
Someone needs deodorant.

48
00:04:50,092 --> 00:04:53,323
<i>All right, all right, here we go.</i>

49
00:04:54,292 --> 00:04:56,123
<i>Everything is under control.</i>

50
00:04:56,332 --> 00:04:57,970
<i>Nothing to worry about.</i>

51
00:04:59,372 --> 00:05:02,762
<i>Excuse me. I haven't</i>
<i>introduced myself, have I?</i>

52
00:05:03,412 --> 00:05:05,130
<i>My name is Peter Fallow.</i>

53
00:05:05,452 --> 00:05:06,885
<i>I am a writer.</i>

54
00:05:07,372 --> 00:05:09,090
<i>But you know that already.</i>

55
00:05:09,292 --> 00:05:12,648
<i>Unless you haven't read a newspaper</i>
<i>or seen a TV recently...</i>

56
00:05:12,852 --> 00:05:14,763
<i>... you know exactly who I am.</i>

57
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:18,485
<i>I am the man of the moment.</i>

58
00:05:19,532 --> 00:05:21,488
<i>The hero of the evening.</i>

59
00:05:21,932 --> 00:05:24,162
<i>Me and a book I happened to write.</i>

60
00:05:25,812 --> 00:05:29,282
<i>The real hero of the evening</i>
<i>is not even with us tonight.</i>

61
00:05:29,612 --> 00:05:31,523
<i>We'll come to him in a minute.</i>

62
00:05:31,692 --> 00:05:34,968
<i>For now, indulge yourself</i>
<i>in the extravagance of the moment...</i>

63
00:05:35,052 --> 00:05:39,284
<i>... and remember, if you will,</i>
<i>a phrase from another little best-seller.</i>

64
00:05:41,812 --> 00:05:45,851
<i>"What does it profit a man if he gains</i>
<i>the whole world and loses his soul?"</i>

65
00:05:46,812 --> 00:05:48,131
They're waiting.

66
00:05:48,972 --> 00:05:52,089
<i>This is a story about such a man.</i>

67
00:05:55,532 --> 00:05:57,170
There he is!

68
00:06:08,412 --> 00:06:11,484
<i>And it begins on a rainy night</i>
<i>a little over a year ago.</i>

69
00:06:17,932 --> 00:06:21,925
<i>Our hero, Sherman McCoy,</i>
<i>was about to make a simple phone call.</i>

70
00:06:22,572 --> 00:06:26,645
<i>But despite the existence of 11 phones</i>
<i>and seven different lines...</i>

71
00:06:26,772 --> 00:06:30,242
<i>... in the 14 rooms</i>
<i>of his $6-million-plus apartment...</i>

72
00:06:30,492 --> 00:06:33,370
<i>... this was a phone call</i>
<i>he could not make at home.</i>

73
00:06:35,572 --> 00:06:37,608
What on earth are you doing?

74
00:06:40,012 --> 00:06:41,923
I'm taking the dog for a walk.

75
00:06:42,132 --> 00:06:45,488
You're not taking "the dog" for a walk,
you're taking "Marshall."

76
00:06:45,652 --> 00:06:49,008
Marshall has a name. He's family.
And, anyway...

77
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:50,891
...it's raining.

78
00:06:51,052 --> 00:06:52,371
I know that.

79
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:54,404
So does Marshall.

80
00:06:54,612 --> 00:06:56,409
He doesn't want to go.

81
00:06:56,692 --> 00:06:58,330
Do you, Marshall?

82
00:06:58,572 --> 00:06:59,766
Judy...

83
00:07:00,972 --> 00:07:03,611
All right. Have a nice time.

84
00:07:08,692 --> 00:07:11,047
He's not happy about it, Mr. McCoy.

85
00:07:11,292 --> 00:07:12,645
Neither am I, Bill.

86
00:07:12,732 --> 00:07:14,768
Tony, sir. My name is Tony.

87
00:07:15,052 --> 00:07:16,644
Well, whatever.

88
00:07:20,492 --> 00:07:22,244
Let's be men about this.

89
00:07:35,532 --> 00:07:36,647
Hello, Sherman.

90
00:07:36,732 --> 00:07:38,290
Good evening, Pollard.

91
00:07:38,412 --> 00:07:40,004
It's raining, you know.

92
00:07:40,212 --> 00:07:42,362
I did notice, yes.

93
00:07:42,572 --> 00:07:45,882
Ah, Sherman, a true friend
to man's best friend.

94
00:07:49,292 --> 00:07:52,170
Pollard, you old phrase-maker.

95
00:07:52,372 --> 00:07:53,441
I beg your pardon?

96
00:07:53,652 --> 00:07:55,847
Is that the best you can do?

97
00:07:56,052 --> 00:07:58,088
Is that as witty as we get?

98
00:07:58,332 --> 00:08:00,402
I don't know what you're talking about.

99
00:08:00,492 --> 00:08:05,441
Furthermore, if you're wet
when you return, take the service elevator.

100
00:08:09,172 --> 00:08:10,605
Come on, Marshall.

101
00:08:52,692 --> 00:08:54,887
Maria, hello. It's me.

102
00:08:55,732 --> 00:08:56,881
Who?

103
00:08:57,132 --> 00:08:59,566
<i>I'm sorry. May I speak to Maria?</i>

104
00:08:59,852 --> 00:09:00,967
Who is this?

105
00:09:05,532 --> 00:09:07,250
Sherman, is that you?

106
00:09:11,772 --> 00:09:12,966
Jesus!

107
00:09:19,452 --> 00:09:21,010
We're back.

108
00:09:22,132 --> 00:09:25,966
You were right. I got soaking wet
and Marshall didn't do anything.

109
00:09:27,732 --> 00:09:30,087
If you want to talk to a Maria...

110
00:09:30,252 --> 00:09:31,526
...why call me?

111
00:09:31,692 --> 00:09:33,284
What do you mean?

112
00:09:33,492 --> 00:09:36,723
Please don't lie.
It makes your forehead crinkle.

113
00:09:37,772 --> 00:09:39,683
What are we talking about?

114
00:09:41,452 --> 00:09:43,568
You should see your face.

115
00:09:44,212 --> 00:09:47,204
I don't get it. Did I miss something?

116
00:09:47,412 --> 00:09:51,883
You're going to stand there and say
you didn't call here asking for Maria?

117
00:09:53,132 --> 00:09:55,521
You think I don't know your voice?

118
00:09:55,932 --> 00:09:58,400
Judy, I was out walking the dog.

119
00:09:59,292 --> 00:10:01,487
Crinkle, crinkle.

120
00:10:01,692 --> 00:10:05,810
I am not lying. I took the dog for a walk.

121
00:10:06,412 --> 00:10:08,482
Then I came back here and wham!

122
00:10:08,892 --> 00:10:11,406
I hardly know what to say.

123
00:10:11,852 --> 00:10:14,730
You are asking me to prove
a negative proposition.

124
00:10:14,892 --> 00:10:16,689
Negative proposition?

125
00:10:19,052 --> 00:10:20,485
Oh, God, Sherman.

126
00:10:20,692 --> 00:10:24,731
Listen to the way I sound.
Listen to the stress. Hear it?

127
00:10:27,372 --> 00:10:29,932
I don't want to be this person. I don't.

128
00:10:30,132 --> 00:10:32,168
I am thin and beautiful.

129
00:10:32,412 --> 00:10:34,323
I do not deserve this.

130
00:10:36,972 --> 00:10:39,247
Here's the phone. Call her from here.

131
00:10:39,532 --> 00:10:42,410
I don't mind. I really don't mind.

132
00:10:43,092 --> 00:10:46,448
You are cheap and rotten and a liar.

133
00:10:47,372 --> 00:10:50,091
And you are dripping
on my Aubusson carpet.

134
00:10:53,452 --> 00:10:54,885
<i>She was right.</i>

135
00:10:55,092 --> 00:10:56,650
<i>And Sherman knew it.</i>

136
00:10:56,892 --> 00:10:59,565
<i>Christ! How could he have been so stupid?</i>

137
00:11:00,252 --> 00:11:02,402
<i>A simple phone call.</i>

138
00:11:03,212 --> 00:11:06,010
<i>The next day, Judy's words still rang</i>
<i>in his ears.</i>

139
00:11:06,132 --> 00:11:08,168
<i>"Cheap, rotten and a liar."</i>

140
00:11:08,332 --> 00:11:11,290
- Campbell, are we ready?
- I'm out of here.

141
00:11:11,692 --> 00:11:13,284
Hold on.

142
00:11:14,092 --> 00:11:15,605
Where is your mother?

143
00:11:16,572 --> 00:11:19,086
She's crying on the Lifecycle.

144
00:11:21,492 --> 00:11:23,562
<i>"Crying on the Lifecycle."</i>

145
00:11:24,332 --> 00:11:28,371
<i>Like so many men before him,</i>
<i>he was no match for a woman's tears.</i>

146
00:11:29,532 --> 00:11:33,002
She won't kiss me because I'm all wet.

147
00:11:33,852 --> 00:11:37,208
Campbell, come and give
your mother a kiss.

148
00:11:52,172 --> 00:11:53,924
<i>Why couldn't he just say it:</i>

149
00:11:54,492 --> 00:11:56,642
<i>"Look, Judy, I still love you.</i>

150
00:11:56,892 --> 00:12:00,771
<i>"I still love our daughter,</i>
<i>our home, our life.</i>

151
00:12:01,132 --> 00:12:03,521
<i>"But I am a Master of the Universe.</i>

152
00:12:03,732 --> 00:12:05,609
<i>"I deserve more."</i>

153
00:12:14,412 --> 00:12:16,972
<i>Like the few privileged others</i>
<i>on Wall Street.</i>

154
00:12:17,052 --> 00:12:20,408
<i>How many? Two, three,</i>
<i>maybe 400 at most.</i>

155
00:12:20,652 --> 00:12:23,371
<i>For these men,</i>
<i>these Masters of the Universe...</i>

156
00:12:23,772 --> 00:12:25,888
<i>... and Sherman McCoy was one of them...</i>

157
00:12:25,972 --> 00:12:27,690
<i>... there were no limits whatsoever.</i>

158
00:12:34,812 --> 00:12:38,088
<i>Hi. This is 555-8771.</i>

159
00:12:38,412 --> 00:12:41,449
<i>Leave a message and I'll call you back.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>

160
00:12:42,012 --> 00:12:45,846
Maria, I've been calling you for days.
Call me at the office.

161
00:12:45,972 --> 00:12:47,690
Gene's on from London.

162
00:12:48,012 --> 00:12:50,651
- Let's go! Let's go!
- Calm down, Rawlie.

163
00:12:50,892 --> 00:12:52,689
Let's not get overexcited.

164
00:12:53,292 --> 00:12:55,362
Calm, cool, collated.

165
00:12:55,572 --> 00:12:58,848
Let's not lose our composure
over a few hundred million dollars.

166
00:12:58,932 --> 00:13:01,492
Christ, Sherman, you must be made of ice.

167
00:13:01,932 --> 00:13:05,891
Just remember, a frantic salesman
is a dead one.

168
00:13:06,612 --> 00:13:09,649
<i>What the hell will</i>
<i>this crazy Giscard deal cost us?</i>

169
00:13:09,972 --> 00:13:12,361
I need $600,000,000 to buy the bonds.

170
00:13:12,652 --> 00:13:16,691
<i>You want us to sit on $600,000,000 worth</i>
<i>of French government bonds?</i>

171
00:13:16,972 --> 00:13:20,044
I'm confident on this.
It's a real sleeping beauty.

172
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:22,766
- Where are you, Gene?
- <i>At a cricket match.</i>

173
00:13:22,892 --> 00:13:25,964
<i>Somebody just hit the hell out of the ball.</i>

174
00:13:26,252 --> 00:13:28,561
- Who's playing?
- <i>Don't get technical.</i>

175
00:13:28,812 --> 00:13:30,689
<i>A bunch of men in white pants.</i>

176
00:13:30,772 --> 00:13:32,728
How about it? Are we in or out?

177
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:35,042
<i>Gold has to hold steady.</i>

178
00:13:35,212 --> 00:13:37,931
Bernard Sachs is already in
for $300,000,000.

179
00:13:38,172 --> 00:13:39,525
Feel better?

180
00:13:39,732 --> 00:13:42,007
<i>You are going to make me an old man.</i>

181
00:13:42,252 --> 00:13:44,561
A rich old man, Gene. A rich old man.

182
00:13:45,932 --> 00:13:48,241
<i>A $600,000,000 deal.</i>

183
00:13:48,492 --> 00:13:51,131
<i>Sherman's commission</i>
<i>would be $ 1. 7 million.</i>

184
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:52,964
<i>All in a day's work.</i>

185
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:55,202
<i>He was there! At the top!</i>

186
00:13:55,452 --> 00:13:57,488
<i>Impervious, untouchable...</i>

187
00:13:57,772 --> 00:13:59,763
<i>... insulated by wealth and power.</i>

188
00:13:59,852 --> 00:14:01,808
<i>A Master of the Universe.</i>

189
00:14:02,412 --> 00:14:05,165
<i>A great height</i>
<i>from which to view the world.</i>

190
00:14:05,652 --> 00:14:07,722
<i>A great height from which to fall.</i>

191
00:14:36,492 --> 00:14:40,804
Sherman, you are an absolute angel
coming all the way out here.

192
00:14:41,052 --> 00:14:45,011
I had to talk to you.
I did a very stupid thing.

193
00:14:45,772 --> 00:14:48,491
Are we going to talk about it now?

194
00:14:48,732 --> 00:14:50,450
I'm afraid we have to.

195
00:14:50,652 --> 00:14:54,565
Sherman, don't you want
a little poontang first?

196
00:14:55,932 --> 00:14:59,561
I know it has its funny side,
but it isn't funny.

197
00:14:59,852 --> 00:15:03,208
It's your own fault for getting caught
like a red herring.

198
00:15:04,092 --> 00:15:06,003
You mean red-handed.

199
00:15:07,212 --> 00:15:09,965
Can't we stop talking
about your wife now...

200
00:15:10,252 --> 00:15:16,202
...and head over to our little hideaway
on 59th Street and just hide away a little?

201
00:15:16,652 --> 00:15:17,926
I think she knows.

202
00:15:18,012 --> 00:15:20,401
Of course she knows. That's not the point.

203
00:15:20,492 --> 00:15:21,766
It isn't?

204
00:15:22,572 --> 00:15:25,132
God, Sherman, you are so sweet.

205
00:15:25,332 --> 00:15:29,166
I could eat you alive if I could get
this goddamn zipper down.

206
00:15:30,612 --> 00:15:32,330
Isn't that the turnoff?

207
00:15:33,292 --> 00:15:34,725
The turnoff to Manhattan?

208
00:15:34,812 --> 00:15:37,007
I can't get over right now.

209
00:15:37,212 --> 00:15:39,362
We'll just exit and get back on.

210
00:15:40,372 --> 00:15:42,602
Exit and get back on.

211
00:15:53,652 --> 00:15:54,971
Where are we?

212
00:15:55,452 --> 00:15:56,885
The Bronx.

213
00:15:57,132 --> 00:15:58,531
What does that mean?

214
00:15:58,612 --> 00:16:00,682
It means we're north of Manhattan.

215
00:16:01,772 --> 00:16:05,606
All I need to do is make a right
and find a street back.

216
00:16:10,572 --> 00:16:12,005
<i>And there it was.</i>

217
00:16:12,252 --> 00:16:14,163
<i>A simple wrong turn.</i>

218
00:16:15,052 --> 00:16:16,770
<i>Anyone could have done it.</i>

219
00:16:16,852 --> 00:16:18,410
<i>A simple phone call...</i>

220
00:16:18,492 --> 00:16:21,086
<i>... a simple wrong turn,</i>
<i>and you're off the track...</i>

221
00:16:21,172 --> 00:16:23,970
<i>... moving towards a destiny</i>
<i>you never imagined.</i>

222
00:16:42,772 --> 00:16:44,728
Where are all the white people?

223
00:16:50,292 --> 00:16:52,362
Are they going to scratch the car?

224
00:16:56,332 --> 00:16:59,404
I'm from the South
and I don't like this very much.

225
00:17:00,372 --> 00:17:01,441
Excuse me.

226
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:03,564
Please don't touch the car.

227
00:17:06,972 --> 00:17:08,405
Get us out of here.

228
00:17:09,132 --> 00:17:10,724
I have a red light.

229
00:17:15,172 --> 00:17:16,651
We're having a party!

230
00:17:27,532 --> 00:17:28,965
Get us out of here!

231
00:17:33,012 --> 00:17:35,890
I want my money. I want my money now!

232
00:17:47,372 --> 00:17:49,442
There was no need to panic.

233
00:17:49,972 --> 00:17:51,530
That's what you think.

234
00:17:51,692 --> 00:17:54,001
I have all my luggage with me.

235
00:17:54,132 --> 00:17:57,841
I just don't want to do anything stupid.
If we keep our heads, we'll be fine.

236
00:17:58,132 --> 00:18:00,805
We're in the middle of a war zone...

237
00:18:01,012 --> 00:18:03,810
...and you're worried about
doing the right thing?

238
00:18:06,012 --> 00:18:07,047
An arrow!

239
00:18:07,212 --> 00:18:09,487
Right there. It's an arrow!

240
00:18:09,772 --> 00:18:10,921
I see it.

241
00:18:11,372 --> 00:18:12,805
Then turn!

242
00:18:13,012 --> 00:18:14,161
I'm going to.

243
00:18:22,612 --> 00:18:25,331
There's the ramp back to Manhattan. See?

244
00:18:26,412 --> 00:18:27,686
What's that?

245
00:18:29,772 --> 00:18:31,091
It's a body!

246
00:18:31,252 --> 00:18:32,480
It's an animal!

247
00:18:32,652 --> 00:18:33,767
Is it dead?

248
00:18:33,932 --> 00:18:35,763
It's a tire, that's all!

249
00:18:35,892 --> 00:18:39,521
- It's a dead tire?
- Calm down! It's just a tire!

250
00:18:45,652 --> 00:18:47,085
What are you doing?

251
00:18:47,852 --> 00:18:50,082
I can't drive around it.

252
00:18:51,132 --> 00:18:52,804
You're going to move it?

253
00:18:53,332 --> 00:18:56,051
Yes, that's exactly what I'm going to do.

254
00:18:57,012 --> 00:18:59,572
Sherman, be careful of your shoes.

255
00:19:26,692 --> 00:19:28,444
Sherman, come on.

256
00:19:32,292 --> 00:19:34,852
Touching that dirty old tire.

257
00:19:38,212 --> 00:19:40,123
I just want to get out of here.

258
00:19:40,972 --> 00:19:43,167
I want to get to Manhattan.

259
00:19:43,492 --> 00:19:45,084
Come on, Sherman.

260
00:19:48,292 --> 00:19:49,884
Oh, my God.

261
00:19:50,532 --> 00:19:52,011
Oh, my God.

262
00:19:52,492 --> 00:19:53,891
Natives!

263
00:20:11,972 --> 00:20:13,564
Yo. Need some help?

264
00:20:17,892 --> 00:20:19,484
No, thank you. Hi!

265
00:20:21,252 --> 00:20:23,686
What's the problem? Need help or what?

266
00:20:24,812 --> 00:20:28,168
I don't think so. No. Thank you.
Very much.

267
00:20:34,412 --> 00:20:35,686
Shit.

268
00:20:36,132 --> 00:20:37,247
Shit!

269
00:20:37,772 --> 00:20:39,490
Sherman, come on!

270
00:20:58,732 --> 00:21:00,484
I have to go.

271
00:21:04,612 --> 00:21:06,728
Where are you going with the tire?

272
00:21:10,052 --> 00:21:13,124
This is yours? Oh, then here, you take it.

273
00:21:19,172 --> 00:21:20,764
Oh, my God!

274
00:21:20,972 --> 00:21:22,690
Get in the car, quick!

275
00:21:24,692 --> 00:21:25,807
Here they come!

276
00:21:25,892 --> 00:21:27,086
Lock the door!

277
00:21:27,332 --> 00:21:28,287
Drive.

278
00:21:28,452 --> 00:21:30,204
Open the door!

279
00:21:30,852 --> 00:21:32,649
Get away! Get away!

280
00:21:32,972 --> 00:21:34,405
Careful. Look out!

281
00:21:36,292 --> 00:21:37,566
Back up!

282
00:21:37,772 --> 00:21:40,969
Get away from the car! I can't see a thing!

283
00:21:45,892 --> 00:21:47,007
Watch out!

284
00:21:50,732 --> 00:21:51,687
Go, car!

285
00:21:55,172 --> 00:21:56,764
Bitch, open this door!

286
00:22:03,532 --> 00:22:05,250
Where's the ramp?

287
00:22:06,692 --> 00:22:08,967
What are we doing here?

288
00:22:09,252 --> 00:22:11,163
Just make a left.

289
00:22:12,012 --> 00:22:14,367
A left? Okay, a left.

290
00:22:47,332 --> 00:22:51,325
Sherman, fuck the luggage.
Let's go have a drink.

291
00:23:01,932 --> 00:23:04,605
Maybe we should tell the police about this.

292
00:23:05,932 --> 00:23:09,129
Yes, the police. We were almost robbed.

293
00:23:11,692 --> 00:23:16,288
There's a possibility that you...
that we hit one of them.

294
00:23:18,372 --> 00:23:21,569
There was this sound,
like we hit one of them.

295
00:23:21,892 --> 00:23:23,962
Did you see him get hit?

296
00:23:27,212 --> 00:23:28,645
Neither did I.

297
00:23:28,932 --> 00:23:32,925
So, if a question ever arises,
two boys blocked the road.

298
00:23:33,132 --> 00:23:36,329
They tried to rob us, and we got away.
That's all we know.

299
00:23:36,492 --> 00:23:39,848
But if we call the police now,
then we're not...

300
00:23:40,132 --> 00:23:43,329
Let's call them and invite them
to our little love nest.

301
00:23:43,492 --> 00:23:45,244
They'd love to get us.

302
00:23:45,412 --> 00:23:49,087
The police, the press,
and all the rest of the "mediarites".

303
00:23:50,252 --> 00:23:51,844
Mediarites?

304
00:23:52,452 --> 00:23:56,764
The newspapers, radio, television.
I can see it now.

305
00:23:56,932 --> 00:24:02,165
"Mr. Sherman McCoy of Park Avenue,
and Mrs. Arthur Ruskin of Fifth Avenue...

306
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:06,407
"...are recuperating after their adventures
in the Bronx."

307
00:24:11,492 --> 00:24:13,722
Explain that one to your wife.

308
00:24:14,212 --> 00:24:16,123
Yes, you have a point.

309
00:24:20,132 --> 00:24:21,770
But I'd feel better if...

310
00:24:22,412 --> 00:24:24,926
You don't have to feel better.

311
00:24:25,772 --> 00:24:27,842
I was the one who was driving.

312
00:24:28,292 --> 00:24:30,362
And I say I didn't hit anybody.

313
00:24:30,532 --> 00:24:33,729
And I'm not reporting anything
to the police.

314
00:24:34,052 --> 00:24:38,682
And if you're a gentleman,
you'll support me in that decision.

315
00:24:45,892 --> 00:24:47,644
We were in the jungle.

316
00:24:48,972 --> 00:24:51,202
- We were attacked.
- That's true.

317
00:24:51,492 --> 00:24:54,131
- We fought our way out.
- We could've been killed.

318
00:24:54,212 --> 00:24:55,645
We fought.

319
00:24:56,132 --> 00:24:58,043
I feel like an animal.

320
00:24:58,572 --> 00:25:00,767
You drove the hell out of that car.

321
00:25:00,932 --> 00:25:04,288
The hard part was getting into the seat,
over that gearshift.

322
00:25:04,452 --> 00:25:05,885
No, it was instinct.

323
00:25:06,092 --> 00:25:07,684
God, and that tire!

324
00:25:07,972 --> 00:25:10,725
- He was big, wasn't he?
- Sherman was bigger.

325
00:25:11,212 --> 00:25:13,726
- You were great.
- We were both great.

326
00:25:15,852 --> 00:25:19,049
This could be the best sex we've had
in a long time.

327
00:25:19,532 --> 00:25:22,524
- I still think...
- Don't think!

328
00:25:22,732 --> 00:25:24,290
Just fuck!

329
00:25:32,612 --> 00:25:34,204
Mr. Sonnenberg?

330
00:25:35,972 --> 00:25:38,247
Where the hell is Mr. Sonnenberg?

331
00:25:40,172 --> 00:25:44,006
Mr. Lockwood, you sit down.
If and when your lawyer appears...

332
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:45,884
Two to six, Judge.

333
00:25:46,412 --> 00:25:50,041
Two to six. Two weeks ago,
he told me two to six.

334
00:25:50,572 --> 00:25:52,210
Two to six, or we go to trial.

335
00:25:52,292 --> 00:25:54,681
- Nobody wants to go to trial.
- I'll go.

336
00:25:54,852 --> 00:25:56,331
Approach the bench.

337
00:25:56,492 --> 00:25:58,403
I'll approach the bench.

338
00:26:01,132 --> 00:26:05,091
Listen, you son of a bitch.
You're a nice boy, with a lot going for you.

339
00:26:05,252 --> 00:26:09,086
We got 7,000 felony indictments
in the Bronx every year.

340
00:26:09,292 --> 00:26:12,090
We got room for 650 trials.
Yours isn't one of them.

341
00:26:12,172 --> 00:26:13,366
I go to trial.

342
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:15,483
You go sit down.

343
00:26:15,812 --> 00:26:19,327
And you'll take whatever plea bargain
we give you.

344
00:26:19,532 --> 00:26:23,411
You'll kiss my ass and thank me
that I didn't put you away for 25 years.

345
00:26:23,532 --> 00:26:27,650
That's what you'd get if this case goes
to trial. Now get out of my face.

346
00:26:37,932 --> 00:26:39,206
What'd he do?

347
00:26:39,972 --> 00:26:44,443
Robbed and raped a 70-year-old lady
and put her in a garbage can.

348
00:26:44,652 --> 00:26:46,085
Jesus Christ.

349
00:26:46,412 --> 00:26:48,164
Welcome to the South Bronx.

350
00:26:49,572 --> 00:26:51,847
People versus Harold Williams.

351
00:26:52,772 --> 00:26:55,366
Indictment number 294721.

352
00:26:57,612 --> 00:27:00,001
This case was dismissed three weeks ago.

353
00:27:00,132 --> 00:27:01,531
Go get 'em, tiger.

354
00:27:02,532 --> 00:27:04,090
Why is this case here?

355
00:27:06,052 --> 00:27:08,771
May I approach the bench, Your Honor?

356
00:27:09,572 --> 00:27:11,085
Who the hell are you?

357
00:27:13,132 --> 00:27:15,248
Assistant District Attorney Kramer.

358
00:27:15,692 --> 00:27:18,252
Mr. Kramer, you are new here.

359
00:27:18,572 --> 00:27:20,563
Let me explain something to you.

360
00:27:21,252 --> 00:27:24,483
This case is what we call a piece of shit.

361
00:27:24,812 --> 00:27:28,600
Which, loosely translated,
means you don't have any evidence.

362
00:27:30,372 --> 00:27:34,365
Except that District Attorney Weiss
has instructed me to show you...

363
00:27:34,532 --> 00:27:37,569
I know who the District Attorney is,
Mr. Kramer.

364
00:27:38,732 --> 00:27:42,042
The only reason Mr. Weiss is interested
in this case...

365
00:27:42,252 --> 00:27:44,607
...is because Mr. Williams over there...

366
00:27:44,972 --> 00:27:48,806
...is a white man who lives
in a nice big house in Riverdale.

367
00:27:50,252 --> 00:27:51,765
I'm not following you.

368
00:27:51,852 --> 00:27:54,002
Because it's an election year.

369
00:27:54,092 --> 00:27:57,528
Ninety-nine percent of those you shovel
through this court are black...

370
00:27:57,612 --> 00:28:00,763
...and the other ninety-nine percent
don't speak English.

371
00:28:01,252 --> 00:28:02,731
But they do vote.

372
00:28:03,532 --> 00:28:06,729
So your boss, the District Attorney,
Mr. Weiss...

373
00:28:07,172 --> 00:28:11,006
...who dreams every night
of one day becoming mayor of New York...

374
00:28:11,212 --> 00:28:12,930
...needs a white man.

375
00:28:13,092 --> 00:28:16,482
He needs to find him, book him,
and throw him in jail.

376
00:28:16,972 --> 00:28:18,644
Then everybody likes him.

377
00:28:18,732 --> 00:28:20,643
The press and voters like him.

378
00:28:22,412 --> 00:28:24,687
Even your mother would like him.

379
00:28:24,972 --> 00:28:27,008
- You following me?
- I am now.

380
00:28:27,212 --> 00:28:29,521
Now you tell your boss,
"Captain Ahab Weiss"...

381
00:28:29,612 --> 00:28:33,890
...that I know he's out there looking
for "the great white defendant."

382
00:28:34,092 --> 00:28:36,765
But Mr. Williams, over there, is not it!

383
00:28:39,212 --> 00:28:40,884
Don't take it personally.

384
00:28:41,252 --> 00:28:43,243
Maybe he didn't like your shoes.

385
00:28:43,652 --> 00:28:44,846
You Andruitti?

386
00:28:45,252 --> 00:28:48,688
I'm Martin, this is Goldberg.
We just came from Bronx Hospital.

387
00:28:49,092 --> 00:28:52,641
Kid named Henry Lamb came in last night
with a broken wrist.

388
00:28:52,932 --> 00:28:55,207
They fixed him up and sent him home.

389
00:28:55,492 --> 00:28:58,370
This morning, he comes back in
with a concussion.

390
00:28:58,532 --> 00:29:01,251
He goes into a coma
and now they say he'll die.

391
00:29:01,412 --> 00:29:02,891
Did you talk to him?

392
00:29:03,052 --> 00:29:04,644
He's in a coma.

393
00:29:05,612 --> 00:29:07,330
What else?

394
00:29:07,492 --> 00:29:09,483
There's a nurse busting my balls.

395
00:29:09,572 --> 00:29:13,485
Says the kid told his mother he was hit
by a Mercedes, which drove off.

396
00:29:13,572 --> 00:29:15,642
- Hit-and-run.
- The mother told you this?

397
00:29:15,812 --> 00:29:19,646
She's got a pile of parking tickets
and won't talk to the police.

398
00:29:19,812 --> 00:29:21,131
Why come to us?

399
00:29:21,292 --> 00:29:24,602
You've got an unconscious victim,
no witness, and no driver.

400
00:29:25,292 --> 00:29:28,648
You've got what we call a piece of shit.
Right, Kramer?

401
00:29:28,972 --> 00:29:30,803
What we've got is a problem.

402
00:29:31,012 --> 00:29:33,082
Ever hear of Reverend Bacon?

403
00:29:33,892 --> 00:29:35,848
No, not me, gentlemen.

404
00:29:36,132 --> 00:29:39,010
Kramer, this is all yours. See you later.

405
00:29:41,572 --> 00:29:43,051
Reverend Bacon?

406
00:29:52,012 --> 00:29:54,207
This is a tragedy!

407
00:29:55,332 --> 00:29:58,404
A fine young man has been struck down.

408
00:29:59,532 --> 00:30:03,525
God-fearing, church-going,
never in trouble...

409
00:30:04,132 --> 00:30:07,966
...graduated from high school,
on his way to college.

410
00:30:08,172 --> 00:30:12,051
Somebody comes along,
some rich white people...

411
00:30:12,332 --> 00:30:15,165
...in a rich white man's car and wham!

412
00:30:18,052 --> 00:30:21,408
They run him down and never even stop.

413
00:30:25,292 --> 00:30:27,852
Now what'll we do
about these parking tickets?

414
00:30:31,332 --> 00:30:33,846
First of all, Reverend... Is it Reverend?

415
00:30:33,932 --> 00:30:36,321
Is, was and always will be.

416
00:30:37,892 --> 00:30:40,326
First of all, we have no evidence...

417
00:30:40,652 --> 00:30:42,563
This is your evidence!

418
00:30:45,292 --> 00:30:47,647
I'm sorry. I didn't see you.

419
00:30:47,852 --> 00:30:50,730
Mrs. Lamb is not speaking to the police.

420
00:30:51,052 --> 00:30:53,805
Until we have proper counsel,
I'll speak for her.

421
00:30:54,252 --> 00:30:55,844
Fine. That's good.

422
00:30:56,132 --> 00:31:00,444
I just want to get a few things straight.
The boy was hit by a car?

423
00:31:00,612 --> 00:31:02,125
On Bruckner Boulevard!

424
00:31:02,212 --> 00:31:05,409
Innocently walking along
minding his own business.

425
00:31:05,612 --> 00:31:08,001
A clear case of hit-and-run.

426
00:31:08,612 --> 00:31:12,969
But there were no witnesses.
Without a witness, you have no case.

427
00:31:13,252 --> 00:31:15,083
You got what he told his mother.

428
00:31:15,172 --> 00:31:16,446
It's hearsay.

429
00:31:16,612 --> 00:31:20,651
You and I may believe it,
but it's not admissible in a court of law.

430
00:31:21,092 --> 00:31:23,811
If this boy was born on Park Avenue...

431
00:31:23,972 --> 00:31:27,009
...and was run down by two niggers
in a Pontiac...

432
00:31:27,172 --> 00:31:29,242
...then you'd have a case, right?

433
00:31:29,372 --> 00:31:31,886
I work Park Avenue
and Bruckner Boulevard.

434
00:31:31,972 --> 00:31:34,042
There's good and bad in both places.

435
00:31:34,212 --> 00:31:36,601
We'll try to help this lady...

436
00:31:36,732 --> 00:31:38,802
...but there's not much to go on.

437
00:31:40,332 --> 00:31:42,892
I want you to make an investment here.

438
00:31:43,172 --> 00:31:46,369
An investment in steam control.

439
00:31:47,372 --> 00:31:48,646
Steam control?

440
00:31:49,132 --> 00:31:50,724
Steam control.

441
00:31:51,372 --> 00:31:55,206
A righteous steam is building up
in the souls of my people.

442
00:31:55,492 --> 00:31:57,722
And that steam is ready to blow!

443
00:31:58,092 --> 00:31:59,320
I see.

444
00:31:59,972 --> 00:32:03,044
On Judgment Day, I am your safety valve.

445
00:32:03,212 --> 00:32:05,885
Because when it blows, and it will...

446
00:32:06,092 --> 00:32:10,529
...how grateful you will be
that I am on your side.

447
00:32:10,732 --> 00:32:15,408
The one nigger who can control
the steam and save your white ass...

448
00:32:16,052 --> 00:32:18,282
...from being burned
off the face of the earth.

449
00:32:18,372 --> 00:32:19,646
So to speak.

450
00:32:23,052 --> 00:32:25,612
Thank you. We'll see what we can do.

451
00:32:26,372 --> 00:32:27,646
Excuse me.

452
00:32:39,532 --> 00:32:40,806
Thank you.

453
00:32:42,212 --> 00:32:43,486
He said...

454
00:32:44,332 --> 00:32:47,210
He said it started with an "R."

455
00:32:48,292 --> 00:32:51,329
<i>The second letter was an "E"...</i>

456
00:32:52,012 --> 00:32:53,445
<i>... or a "P."</i>

457
00:32:53,892 --> 00:32:58,329
<i>Those were the first two letters</i>
<i>of the license plate.</i>

458
00:33:00,932 --> 00:33:03,162
We should move up here.

459
00:33:05,252 --> 00:33:09,086
Have you ever thought about moving out
of New York?

460
00:33:09,572 --> 00:33:13,406
Keep a small place in town.
Save loads of money. What do you think?

461
00:33:15,012 --> 00:33:16,286
About what?

462
00:33:16,972 --> 00:33:19,327
Do you think we could leave New York?

463
00:33:22,852 --> 00:33:24,171
My father did it.

464
00:33:24,452 --> 00:33:26,682
You are not your father.

465
00:33:28,492 --> 00:33:30,244
<i>She knew how to hurt a guy.</i>

466
00:33:30,852 --> 00:33:33,571
<i>No, he was nothing like his father.</i>

467
00:33:34,412 --> 00:33:38,087
<i>His father, "The Lion of Dunning,</i>
<i>Sponget and Leach. "</i>

468
00:33:38,372 --> 00:33:41,728
<i>His father, who took the subway</i>
<i>to work every day of his life.</i>

469
00:33:41,932 --> 00:33:44,969
<i>His father, who believed</i>
<i>in principles and ethics...</i>

470
00:33:45,292 --> 00:33:49,922
<i>... whose lessons about duty and debt</i>
<i>had whistled through his son's head.</i>

471
00:33:51,652 --> 00:33:54,086
<i>Sherman McCoy was</i>
<i>nothing like his father.</i>

472
00:33:55,372 --> 00:33:57,932
What're you looking for in that paper?

473
00:33:58,412 --> 00:34:00,482
Nothing. Nothing special.

474
00:34:00,812 --> 00:34:02,404
What's a bond?

475
00:34:02,692 --> 00:34:04,444
Sherman, do explain it.

476
00:34:04,652 --> 00:34:07,689
Yes, your mother and I really want
to hear this.

477
00:34:09,732 --> 00:34:12,963
A bond is a way of lending people money.

478
00:34:13,292 --> 00:34:17,763
Say you want to build a road or a hospital,
and you need a lot of money.

479
00:34:18,052 --> 00:34:20,486
What you do is issue a bond.

480
00:34:21,412 --> 00:34:23,004
Do you build roads?

481
00:34:23,652 --> 00:34:26,041
No, I don't actually build them.

482
00:34:26,212 --> 00:34:27,884
You're in over your head.

483
00:34:28,132 --> 00:34:29,724
Let me try.

484
00:34:30,412 --> 00:34:34,883
Darling, Daddy doesn't build roads
or hospitals or anything, really.

485
00:34:35,652 --> 00:34:38,689
Daddy handles bonds for the people
who raise the money.

486
00:34:38,892 --> 00:34:41,281
That's what he said. Bonds.

487
00:34:43,172 --> 00:34:46,847
Just imagine that a bond is a slice of cake.

488
00:34:47,532 --> 00:34:50,092
Now, you didn't bake that cake.

489
00:34:50,412 --> 00:34:53,882
But every time you hand a slice
of that cake to somebody else...

490
00:34:54,052 --> 00:34:55,883
...a little piece comes off.

491
00:34:55,972 --> 00:34:57,610
Little crumbs fall off.

492
00:34:58,092 --> 00:34:59,969
Really. Crumbs?

493
00:35:00,812 --> 00:35:03,531
And you are allowed to keep those crumbs.

494
00:35:03,812 --> 00:35:07,327
And many a man has sold his soul
for those little crumbs.

495
00:35:07,532 --> 00:35:09,284
And that's what Daddy does.

496
00:35:09,572 --> 00:35:13,406
Daddy passes somebody else's cake around
and picks up all of the crumbs.

497
00:35:14,052 --> 00:35:18,887
But you have to imagine a lot of crumbs,
and a great big golden cake...

498
00:35:19,372 --> 00:35:21,442
...and a lot of golden crumbs.

499
00:35:22,692 --> 00:35:26,401
And imagine Daddy running around
picking up every little golden crumb...

500
00:35:26,492 --> 00:35:27,720
...he can grab.

501
00:35:28,132 --> 00:35:30,362
And that's what Daddy does.

502
00:35:31,972 --> 00:35:34,327
You can call them crumbs if you want to.

503
00:35:34,412 --> 00:35:36,448
I'm doing the best I can.

504
00:35:37,452 --> 00:35:38,885
Excuse me.

505
00:35:47,692 --> 00:35:50,684
In my day, there was some integrity to it.

506
00:35:53,732 --> 00:35:57,566
Now it isn't about anything, is it?
Except the money.

507
00:35:58,052 --> 00:36:00,612
Well, I don't make the rules, so...

508
00:36:01,132 --> 00:36:03,566
All the more reason not to play the game.

509
00:36:06,372 --> 00:36:08,283
We're just having a little...

510
00:36:08,652 --> 00:36:10,563
It's nothing really.

511
00:36:15,052 --> 00:36:18,169
<i>Up to this point in our story,</i>
<i>I was blissfully ignorant.</i>

512
00:36:18,332 --> 00:36:20,926
<i>I had no idea of the storm</i>
<i>that was gathering.</i>

513
00:36:21,052 --> 00:36:22,929
<i>Never even heard of Sherman McCoy.</i>

514
00:36:23,012 --> 00:36:27,244
<i>Hadn't the faintest notion that soon</i>
<i>his name would be inexorably tied to mine.</i>

515
00:36:27,452 --> 00:36:30,888
<i>That his fate would be inextricably bound</i>
<i>to my own destiny.</i>

516
00:36:31,132 --> 00:36:32,724
<i>I had my own problems...</i>

517
00:36:32,932 --> 00:36:36,925
<i>... and I had no idea that Sherman McCoy</i>
<i>was the solution I was looking for.</i>

518
00:36:38,652 --> 00:36:40,085
You're bad!

519
00:36:44,812 --> 00:36:46,848
Caroline, you look beautiful!

520
00:36:47,292 --> 00:36:48,691
- You devil.
- You pig.

521
00:36:48,772 --> 00:36:51,605
- Join us for a cocktail.
- No, I'm with someone.

522
00:36:52,092 --> 00:36:54,003
And a pretty someone he is.

523
00:36:55,772 --> 00:36:58,889
Filippo Chirazzi, the artist.
Peter Fallow, the has-been.

524
00:36:58,972 --> 00:37:00,451
<i>Enchanté.</i>

525
00:37:00,732 --> 00:37:02,643
We're crowded this evening.

526
00:37:02,852 --> 00:37:05,571
Why don't you sit on top of Billy Cortez?

527
00:37:05,852 --> 00:37:08,412
I'll see if Caroline will sit on my face.

528
00:37:08,612 --> 00:37:12,890
No thanks. The last time I sat on your face
I got a yeast infection.

529
00:37:16,252 --> 00:37:17,731
Good evening, Peter.

530
00:37:21,212 --> 00:37:23,772
Don't get up. Do you know my daughter?

531
00:37:24,932 --> 00:37:27,321
Of course. How are you, Evelyn?

532
00:37:27,532 --> 00:37:29,762
This is one of my invisible employees.

533
00:37:29,852 --> 00:37:34,004
One of the many journalists
who supposedly write for my newspaper.

534
00:37:34,332 --> 00:37:36,243
You're very honored to see him.

535
00:37:37,212 --> 00:37:38,361
I rarely do.

536
00:37:40,292 --> 00:37:42,965
I can explain. Come have a drink...

537
00:37:43,132 --> 00:37:45,202
We're having a private party.

538
00:37:45,572 --> 00:37:49,121
I was at a dinner last evening,
and halfway through the pudding...

539
00:37:49,372 --> 00:37:53,081
...a 4-year-old child came in
dragging a little toy cart.

540
00:37:53,452 --> 00:37:55,966
And on the cart was a fresh turd.

541
00:37:56,252 --> 00:37:57,685
Her own, I suppose.

542
00:37:57,892 --> 00:38:00,770
The parents just shook their heads
and smiled.

543
00:38:01,212 --> 00:38:03,931
I've made a big investment in you, Peter.

544
00:38:04,132 --> 00:38:06,521
Time and money, and it's not working.

545
00:38:06,892 --> 00:38:09,565
I could just shake my head and smile.

546
00:38:09,892 --> 00:38:12,850
But in my house, when a turd appears,
we deal with it.

547
00:38:12,932 --> 00:38:15,651
We dispose of it. We flush it away.

548
00:38:16,572 --> 00:38:19,291
We don't put it on the table
and call it caviar.

549
00:38:19,652 --> 00:38:22,166
Of course you don't.
I've been working at home.

550
00:38:22,252 --> 00:38:26,564
I'm working on a story that I can't talk
about here. It's a big story.

551
00:38:26,852 --> 00:38:29,446
I sincerely hope so, Peter.

552
00:38:30,332 --> 00:38:32,084
I sincerely hope so.

553
00:38:37,372 --> 00:38:41,047
<i>It was the end of the road for me.</i>
<i>I could see it coming.</i>

554
00:38:42,052 --> 00:38:44,122
<i>See it coming? It was here.</i>

555
00:38:44,892 --> 00:38:47,804
<i>I'd had my chance and I'd blown it away</i>
<i>in a bottle.</i>

556
00:38:48,092 --> 00:38:50,925
<i>It was over. I had to face up to that fact.</i>

557
00:38:53,092 --> 00:38:54,889
<i>I could go back home.</i>

558
00:38:55,172 --> 00:38:57,288
<i>Small town, small newspaper.</i>

559
00:38:57,692 --> 00:39:00,252
<i>Or I could write a novel or two.</i>

560
00:39:00,892 --> 00:39:02,803
<i>Or I could slit my wrists.</i>

561
00:39:03,052 --> 00:39:07,603
<i>This last idea seemed most appealing,</i>
<i>as it required the least amount of effort.</i>

562
00:39:09,852 --> 00:39:11,763
<i>And then the telephone rang.</i>

563
00:39:17,932 --> 00:39:19,843
<i>Peter! Albert Fox here.</i>

564
00:39:25,852 --> 00:39:27,763
Yeah, this is Peter.

565
00:39:28,132 --> 00:39:30,043
You sound terrific.

566
00:39:30,412 --> 00:39:31,970
Any pulse?

567
00:39:33,412 --> 00:39:37,883
<i>I called the paper. No one knew</i>
<i>where you were or who you were.</i>

568
00:39:38,172 --> 00:39:39,810
<i>Anything I should know?</i>

569
00:39:39,932 --> 00:39:42,400
No, I'm just working at home today.

570
00:39:42,652 --> 00:39:46,645
Good. There's something
I want to talk to you about.

571
00:39:46,852 --> 00:39:48,922
There's a hell of a story in it.

572
00:39:49,252 --> 00:39:52,085
<i>Meet me at NBC, studio 4H, 7:00.</i>

573
00:39:59,612 --> 00:40:01,728
You see that Henry Lamb material?

574
00:40:02,012 --> 00:40:03,525
Yeah, I looked at it.

575
00:40:04,292 --> 00:40:05,691
What do you think?

576
00:40:05,852 --> 00:40:07,126
What do I think?

577
00:40:07,452 --> 00:40:10,489
I think it's an unfortunate situation.

578
00:40:10,812 --> 00:40:12,484
Where's the goddamn story?

579
00:40:12,572 --> 00:40:16,724
A poor, innocent black kid
walking down the street...

580
00:40:16,972 --> 00:40:20,726
...and boom! Hit-and-run.
There's a story in it for somebody.

581
00:40:20,932 --> 00:40:23,207
The black community's up in arms.

582
00:40:23,332 --> 00:40:27,120
And when Reverend Bacon gets a feather
in his ass, the shit flies high.

583
00:40:29,052 --> 00:40:31,168
What's your angle on all this?

584
00:40:31,972 --> 00:40:34,088
What do you stand to get out of it?

585
00:40:34,972 --> 00:40:38,009
I'm a lawyer. I want justice done.

586
00:40:39,452 --> 00:40:42,410
Reverend Bacon is my friend.
It'll be good for him.

587
00:40:42,892 --> 00:40:46,646
And knowing your situation,
I thought if you broke the story...

588
00:40:46,812 --> 00:40:48,245
Wait a minute.

589
00:40:50,092 --> 00:40:52,242
What do you mean, my situation?

590
00:40:55,292 --> 00:40:57,760
Your boss was at my house for dinner.

591
00:40:58,332 --> 00:40:59,845
He said a few things.

592
00:41:01,892 --> 00:41:03,166
I see.

593
00:41:06,212 --> 00:41:07,964
You have a little daughter?

594
00:41:08,932 --> 00:41:10,968
I bet she has a toy wagon.

595
00:41:11,212 --> 00:41:12,884
Yes, she does. Why?

596
00:41:13,132 --> 00:41:14,690
Got any scotch in that car?

597
00:41:15,652 --> 00:41:17,563
Henry Lamb. Who's that?

598
00:41:17,852 --> 00:41:21,208
He was a student of yours at Ruppert High.

599
00:41:21,412 --> 00:41:23,004
He was? What's he done?

600
00:41:23,292 --> 00:41:25,852
Nothing. He's been seriously injured.

601
00:41:26,212 --> 00:41:28,089
I'm a newspaper reporter.

602
00:41:28,292 --> 00:41:29,805
I don't remember him.

603
00:41:29,932 --> 00:41:31,888
What kind of student was he?

604
00:41:31,972 --> 00:41:34,361
If I don't remember him,
I guess he was okay.

605
00:41:35,332 --> 00:41:36,924
Was he a good student?

606
00:41:37,692 --> 00:41:41,844
Good doesn't apply at Ruppert High.
They're cooperative or life-threatening.

607
00:41:42,692 --> 00:41:45,286
- Wasn't he going to college?
- City College.

608
00:41:45,892 --> 00:41:50,682
If you live in the city, graduate high school,
and breathe, they take you.

609
00:41:52,492 --> 00:41:56,451
What about his performance in class?
Any aptitude, special skills?

610
00:41:57,692 --> 00:41:59,762
I got 65 students in each class.

611
00:41:59,932 --> 00:42:02,571
Tests, homework, any written work?

612
00:42:02,692 --> 00:42:06,810
There hasn't been written work
at Ruppert High for 20 years.

613
00:42:08,132 --> 00:42:10,521
How do you keep track of the kids?

614
00:42:10,732 --> 00:42:13,405
There must be some records.

615
00:42:13,692 --> 00:42:16,490
You're thinking about
honor students and grades.

616
00:42:16,732 --> 00:42:20,327
We don't make those comparisons.
We just try to keep them off the streets.

617
00:42:20,572 --> 00:42:22,483
At Ruppert, an honor student...

618
00:42:22,652 --> 00:42:26,361
...is somebody who comes to class
and doesn't piss on the teacher.

619
00:42:31,012 --> 00:42:32,604
By that standard...

620
00:42:33,532 --> 00:42:35,602
...was Henry Lamb an honor student?

621
00:42:38,572 --> 00:42:39,925
He never pissed on me.

622
00:42:40,252 --> 00:42:44,723
No, you're exaggerating the situation.
The franc is no problem.

623
00:42:45,292 --> 00:42:49,729
We can hedge that to next January,
to the term or to both, whatever.

624
00:42:50,852 --> 00:42:52,968
I don't think that's necessary.

625
00:42:56,732 --> 00:42:59,769
Look, Bernard, we've had our share of...

626
00:43:00,252 --> 00:43:05,929
Hell, I wouldn't even call them... problems,
so let's not work ourselves up...

627
00:43:06,212 --> 00:43:08,442
...into a... coma.

628
00:43:08,732 --> 00:43:10,643
Jesus Christ, let me see that!

629
00:43:10,852 --> 00:43:12,444
No, not you, Bernard.

630
00:43:21,572 --> 00:43:24,405
Wait. What the hell are you talking about?

631
00:43:25,052 --> 00:43:28,249
No, we can't wait.
We have to move on this thing now.

632
00:43:31,852 --> 00:43:34,047
You're bringing up phantom issues!

633
00:43:34,332 --> 00:43:37,369
We must pull ourselves together
and fucking do it!

634
00:43:41,052 --> 00:43:43,612
<i>But it was too late. It was gone.</i>

635
00:43:43,852 --> 00:43:45,080
Oh, Jesus.

636
00:43:46,812 --> 00:43:48,723
<i>$600,000,000.</i>

637
00:43:49,412 --> 00:43:53,928
<i>On Wall Street, a frantic salesman was</i>
<i>a dead salesman. And Sherman knew it.</i>

638
00:44:01,532 --> 00:44:02,851
You know what?

639
00:44:03,292 --> 00:44:06,170
I was just thinking of you.
Where have you been?

640
00:44:06,332 --> 00:44:07,890
Have you seen this?

641
00:44:08,092 --> 00:44:10,401
- Don't I get a kiss first?
- Have you read it?

642
00:44:10,492 --> 00:44:13,689
You know I only read
the newspapers spasmodically.

643
00:44:15,132 --> 00:44:16,724
Sporadically?

644
00:44:18,972 --> 00:44:23,602
Who is this Peter Fallow character?
He's got it all wrong!

645
00:44:23,932 --> 00:44:26,810
Excuse me, but what is going on here?

646
00:44:27,132 --> 00:44:30,807
I'm installing a new intercom system.
Super let me in.

647
00:44:31,172 --> 00:44:33,402
Are you Caroline Heftshank?

648
00:44:35,452 --> 00:44:37,329
I need you to sign a receipt.

649
00:44:37,412 --> 00:44:41,087
I don't live here.
I'm a guest of Miss Heftshank.

650
00:44:44,252 --> 00:44:46,163
No problem. I'm all done.

651
00:44:50,212 --> 00:44:52,407
- That was close.
- What's going on?

652
00:44:52,612 --> 00:44:56,571
I don't know. Caroline pays $300 rent
for this place.

653
00:44:56,812 --> 00:45:00,248
It's rent-controlled. I sublet it for $1,100.

654
00:45:00,452 --> 00:45:02,363
But it's not legal.

655
00:45:02,652 --> 00:45:05,962
To get Caroline out,
they have to prove she doesn't live here.

656
00:45:06,052 --> 00:45:10,364
Isn't it weird that he came here today?
After that piece in the paper?

657
00:45:12,772 --> 00:45:15,332
You are completely "paranoidical."

658
00:45:15,812 --> 00:45:19,646
I have to leave for the airport
in about 20 minutes.

659
00:45:20,332 --> 00:45:23,130
So, we don't have much time.

660
00:45:25,252 --> 00:45:27,686
Do you think they could trace
the car to me?

661
00:45:27,772 --> 00:45:30,809
How? They don't have
the full number or a witness.

662
00:45:30,972 --> 00:45:34,965
The only person who could recognize you
is in terminal "comatosis."

663
00:45:35,132 --> 00:45:38,169
But the other fella.
Suppose he comes forward?

664
00:45:38,372 --> 00:45:41,682
If he was going to materialize,
he would have by now.

665
00:45:41,932 --> 00:45:44,810
And he hasn't because he's a criminal.

666
00:45:46,372 --> 00:45:48,010
What a wretched painting.

667
00:45:48,092 --> 00:45:50,970
It's a Filippo Chirazzi.
He's a friend of Caroline's.

668
00:45:51,052 --> 00:45:54,647
- Know him?
- I hope not. God, that looks like you.

669
00:45:54,892 --> 00:45:56,450
No. How could it?

670
00:45:58,812 --> 00:46:03,124
- Where are you going?
- The airport. The car's coming soon.

671
00:46:03,332 --> 00:46:06,404
We have time for a quickie.
What do you say?

672
00:46:08,732 --> 00:46:12,884
I've lost $600,000,000 today.
Possibly my job.

673
00:46:13,532 --> 00:46:16,285
I don't feel terrifically sexy at the moment.

674
00:46:19,612 --> 00:46:22,843
You know I'm a sucker
for a soft dick, Sherman.

675
00:46:23,292 --> 00:46:25,203
You are incorrigible.

676
00:46:28,972 --> 00:46:33,887
I suppose we could still go to the police.
We could get a talented lawyer.

677
00:46:34,012 --> 00:46:36,731
And put our heads right
into the tiger's mouth?

678
00:46:37,372 --> 00:46:39,522
I'm the one who was driving the car.

679
00:46:39,772 --> 00:46:42,809
Shouldn't I be the one
to make that decision?

680
00:46:43,492 --> 00:46:46,052
And I say no. I say no.

681
00:46:47,812 --> 00:46:49,131
Trust me.

682
00:46:49,892 --> 00:46:53,202
Nothing will come
of that little newspaper article.

683
00:46:53,932 --> 00:46:55,843
Absolutely nothing.

684
00:47:12,892 --> 00:47:15,122
Mr. Fallow. Our hero.

685
00:47:17,252 --> 00:47:20,244
I feel as we already know each other.
And Mr. Corsaro.

686
00:47:21,052 --> 00:47:22,610
Nice to see you again.

687
00:47:22,732 --> 00:47:25,200
You have an exclusive. Understand?

688
00:47:25,692 --> 00:47:29,241
I could've had every newspaper
and TV station spreading this news.

689
00:47:29,572 --> 00:47:34,009
But I have chosen only you two.
And I expect big coverage.

690
00:47:34,732 --> 00:47:36,450
In-depth coverage.

691
00:47:36,932 --> 00:47:38,331
Let's get to work.

692
00:47:45,052 --> 00:47:49,045
Might we be making a mountain
out of a molehill? Honestly...

693
00:47:49,212 --> 00:47:51,328
Honesty has nothing to do with this.

694
00:47:51,612 --> 00:47:55,446
This is show business. I've never known
the two to go hand in hand.

695
00:47:55,652 --> 00:47:58,644
Neither have I.
And I'm supposed to be a journalist.

696
00:47:58,812 --> 00:48:01,246
You're a drunk. That's what I heard.

697
00:48:01,692 --> 00:48:05,048
And you're almost out of a job.
Or am I misinformed?

698
00:48:05,212 --> 00:48:06,611
You have the wrong man.

699
00:48:06,692 --> 00:48:08,603
No, I don't think so.

700
00:48:08,932 --> 00:48:10,650
I don't think so at all.

701
00:48:11,492 --> 00:48:13,005
TV's ready, Reverend.

702
00:48:16,012 --> 00:48:19,925
Stay in the wide shot.
Push in when you see the action.

703
00:48:23,932 --> 00:48:25,331
He's something, isn't he?

704
00:48:25,412 --> 00:48:26,561
He sure is.

705
00:48:26,692 --> 00:48:29,923
He's on the level with this one, right?
The story's legitimate.

706
00:48:30,012 --> 00:48:31,047
Of course.

707
00:48:31,132 --> 00:48:32,804
This Henry Lamb's a nice kid.

708
00:48:32,892 --> 00:48:35,770
The neighbors like him. No record.
Honor student.

709
00:48:36,092 --> 00:48:37,684
No question about it.

710
00:48:37,892 --> 00:48:42,044
Personally, I don't care. But, when I finish
with this story, the kid'll be a saint.

711
00:48:42,212 --> 00:48:44,248
Be nice to know it's true, that's all.

712
00:48:44,332 --> 00:48:45,560
It's true.

713
00:48:46,332 --> 00:48:48,562
We're rolling the cameras. Go ahead.

714
00:48:54,492 --> 00:49:01,330
Brothers and sisters, I stand before you
with a heart that is broken.

715
00:49:02,372 --> 00:49:07,082
And I stand before you
with a heart that is angry.

716
00:49:08,132 --> 00:49:14,970
It's heartbroken because our brother,
our neighbor, our son, Henry Lamb...

717
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:19,764
...has been struck down
in the prime of his young life.

718
00:49:20,332 --> 00:49:25,326
And now he lies in a hospital...
broken, like my heart.

719
00:49:25,892 --> 00:49:28,611
But I tell you, my heart is also angry.

720
00:49:28,892 --> 00:49:30,405
Yes! Angry!

721
00:49:30,652 --> 00:49:34,850
Because the driver
of that car didn't do nothing for him!

722
00:49:35,212 --> 00:49:37,123
And neither did the police!

723
00:49:37,372 --> 00:49:40,125
And neither did this man!

724
00:49:40,772 --> 00:49:42,410
Mr. Abraham Weiss.

725
00:49:42,652 --> 00:49:45,849
That's my name. My own fucking name.

726
00:49:47,012 --> 00:49:48,923
That's a complete fuck-up.

727
00:49:50,172 --> 00:49:53,926
- Who the hell are you?
- Assistant District Attorney Kramer.

728
00:49:54,052 --> 00:49:55,610
I work in this office.

729
00:50:04,452 --> 00:50:07,364
<i>Sources at Motor Vehicles say...</i>

730
00:50:07,452 --> 00:50:12,048
<i>... less than 200 Mercedes have plates</i>
<i>beginning with "RE," "RB," or "RP."</i>

731
00:50:14,572 --> 00:50:17,928
How did they get this information
out of Motor Vehicles?

732
00:50:18,052 --> 00:50:21,044
Calm down. We've had this information
for over a week.

733
00:50:21,412 --> 00:50:25,121
Why aren't we doing anything about it?
Why aren't we tracing the car?

734
00:50:25,212 --> 00:50:27,123
Actually, I suggested we...

735
00:50:27,812 --> 00:50:29,928
What am I? The Wizard of Oz?

736
00:50:30,052 --> 00:50:34,250
Trace the car? Trace the car?
We don't even have a witness.

737
00:50:34,652 --> 00:50:37,849
We don't know where it happened,
or even if it happened.

738
00:50:38,012 --> 00:50:39,161
Trace the car.

739
00:50:39,532 --> 00:50:42,683
We don't have a case,
even if we find the car.

740
00:50:43,132 --> 00:50:46,522
If we found the driver,
and the driver came to us and said:

741
00:50:46,852 --> 00:50:49,207
"Yeah, that's right.

742
00:50:49,412 --> 00:50:53,246
"I hit this kid the other night,
and I didn't stop.

743
00:50:53,532 --> 00:50:57,844
"I didn't report it. I'm the guy. I did it."
Then we got a case.

744
00:50:58,172 --> 00:51:00,288
Just trace the fucking car.

745
00:51:07,932 --> 00:51:10,492
Yesterday, I was
a respected Jewish liberal.

746
00:51:11,292 --> 00:51:14,807
Ten minutes of news like this,
and now I'm a hymie racist pig?

747
00:51:17,212 --> 00:51:19,362
The Italians are going to love this.

748
00:51:19,452 --> 00:51:20,885
The Irish, too.

749
00:51:21,692 --> 00:51:22,966
And the WASPs.

750
00:51:24,652 --> 00:51:27,610
They love this shit more than anybody.

751
00:51:27,932 --> 00:51:29,570
They love laughing at me.

752
00:51:30,332 --> 00:51:31,970
All the rich sons of bitches.

753
00:51:32,332 --> 00:51:34,243
They still think they own this town.

754
00:51:34,332 --> 00:51:39,452
They sit in their co-ops, Park Avenue, Fifth,
Beekman Place, snug like a bug.

755
00:51:39,532 --> 00:51:42,205
Twelve-foot ceilings, a wing for them,
one for the help.

756
00:51:42,292 --> 00:51:44,044
They think money'll protect them.

757
00:51:44,132 --> 00:51:45,884
You stupid sons of bitches!

758
00:51:50,852 --> 00:51:54,925
I'd like to light a fire under their
white asses. Let them see how it feels.

759
00:51:55,012 --> 00:51:58,163
Let the Third World see the smoke
and come after them!

760
00:51:58,652 --> 00:52:03,646
Let them feel what it's like when every
Puerto Rican, West Indian, Cuban, Korean...

761
00:52:03,732 --> 00:52:07,168
...Albanian, Filipino, black man
from every borough...

762
00:52:07,492 --> 00:52:10,325
The future knows how to cross a bridge!

763
00:52:12,412 --> 00:52:13,481
You laugh.

764
00:52:14,212 --> 00:52:17,443
You laugh! All right!
Here's what we're going to do!

765
00:52:17,732 --> 00:52:20,929
We're going to turn this thing around
if it kills us!

766
00:52:21,212 --> 00:52:24,170
We'll prove to these black motherfuckers...

767
00:52:24,452 --> 00:52:25,885
Pardon my language.

768
00:52:26,092 --> 00:52:31,086
We'll prove to these niggers
that this administration loves them!

769
00:52:31,652 --> 00:52:33,404
No matter what it takes.

770
00:52:33,772 --> 00:52:36,161
I am no racist hymie.

771
00:52:37,252 --> 00:52:38,446
By November...

772
00:52:39,332 --> 00:52:42,529
...they are going to be thinking of me as...

773
00:52:44,732 --> 00:52:47,690
...the first black district attorney
of Bronx County.

774
00:52:50,492 --> 00:52:52,722
They're going to beg me to be mayor.

775
00:52:53,172 --> 00:52:54,969
We'll walk away with that election.

776
00:52:55,052 --> 00:52:56,087
No question!

777
00:52:56,172 --> 00:52:57,685
That's what we'll do!

778
00:52:59,292 --> 00:53:03,922
If we have to screw every white asshole
from Albany to Park Avenue, we will!

779
00:53:14,852 --> 00:53:16,444
Here he comes now.

780
00:53:16,612 --> 00:53:18,330
- Tony, hi.
- It's Eddie, sir.

781
00:53:18,412 --> 00:53:20,846
I'm Detective Martin,
this is Detective Goldberg.

782
00:53:20,932 --> 00:53:24,288
We're investigating a car accident.
Maybe you heard about it.

783
00:53:27,692 --> 00:53:29,808
Yes! On television.

784
00:53:30,052 --> 00:53:31,963
Last night. My wife...

785
00:53:32,212 --> 00:53:36,524
We said, "We have a Mercedes
and the license starts with 'R."'

786
00:53:36,652 --> 00:53:38,005
You and a lot of people.

787
00:53:38,092 --> 00:53:39,320
Going up?

788
00:53:39,532 --> 00:53:41,887
Yeah. Yes, yes, I will.

789
00:53:42,372 --> 00:53:43,646
Should we...?

790
00:53:43,812 --> 00:53:45,450
Is it bad time for you?

791
00:53:48,932 --> 00:53:50,809
We just have a few questions.

792
00:53:51,332 --> 00:53:53,800
- Was your car in use the night it happened?
- When?

793
00:53:54,292 --> 00:53:55,725
Tuesday, a week ago.

794
00:53:55,812 --> 00:53:57,643
Let me think.

795
00:53:57,772 --> 00:53:59,649
Anybody else use your car?

796
00:53:59,852 --> 00:54:01,604
My wife sometimes.

797
00:54:01,892 --> 00:54:03,120
The men at the garage.

798
00:54:03,212 --> 00:54:06,170
Parking garage? You leave your car
and they park it?

799
00:54:06,372 --> 00:54:08,488
Can we go see it?

800
00:54:09,772 --> 00:54:11,364
The car? Now?

801
00:54:11,572 --> 00:54:15,042
Since we're here.
There's certain things to look for.

802
00:54:15,332 --> 00:54:18,051
We don't find them, we're out of your hair.

803
00:54:18,292 --> 00:54:20,328
So you want to look at the car?

804
00:54:20,812 --> 00:54:22,530
I see. I see.

805
00:54:22,732 --> 00:54:27,487
We don't have a description of a driver,
so we have to look for the car.

806
00:54:27,812 --> 00:54:31,009
We're sorry for the inconvenience,
but it's routine.

807
00:54:31,172 --> 00:54:32,491
I understand.

808
00:54:32,772 --> 00:54:37,846
But if there is a routine,
then I ought to follow the routine...

809
00:54:37,932 --> 00:54:41,720
...that's appropriate to me,
to someone with a car in this situation.

810
00:54:41,812 --> 00:54:42,847
You see?

811
00:54:43,812 --> 00:54:45,723
No, I don't follow.

812
00:54:46,412 --> 00:54:49,961
If there's a routine
in an investigation like this...

813
00:54:50,212 --> 00:54:53,727
...there must also be a routine
for a person like me.

814
00:54:54,892 --> 00:54:57,645
For the owner of a car
with a license number.

815
00:54:57,892 --> 00:54:59,848
That's what I need to consider.

816
00:55:00,652 --> 00:55:02,085
The routine.

817
00:55:03,212 --> 00:55:05,328
We just want to look at your car.

818
00:55:06,212 --> 00:55:08,328
That's what I mean. You see?

819
00:55:09,052 --> 00:55:09,848
No.

820
00:55:10,732 --> 00:55:12,450
Excuse me, Mr. McCoy.

821
00:55:13,572 --> 00:55:15,449
Do you want to tell us something?

822
00:55:15,732 --> 00:55:16,721
No.

823
00:55:18,052 --> 00:55:19,485
How do you mean?

824
00:55:19,972 --> 00:55:23,169
I mean, if there is,
now is the time to tell us.

825
00:55:23,332 --> 00:55:25,243
Before things get complicated.

826
00:55:26,732 --> 00:55:29,565
I just think that to be certain...

827
00:55:29,812 --> 00:55:32,770
...to be safe, sure, I think...

828
00:55:35,172 --> 00:55:39,006
If you want to cooperate, that'd be great.

829
00:55:40,452 --> 00:55:42,920
If you have a reason not to cooperate...

830
00:55:43,012 --> 00:55:46,527
...you don't have to say anything.
That's your right.

831
00:55:46,692 --> 00:55:49,286
If you want, you can say nothing at all.

832
00:55:49,972 --> 00:55:52,281
You also have the right to an attorney.

833
00:55:52,612 --> 00:55:54,682
For that matter...

834
00:55:55,252 --> 00:55:57,766
...if you lack funds for an attorney...

835
00:55:58,052 --> 00:56:01,010
...the state will provide you
with one free of charge.

836
00:56:01,732 --> 00:56:03,450
If that's what you wanted.

837
00:56:07,052 --> 00:56:09,407
I think what I should do is...

838
00:56:12,332 --> 00:56:14,050
...talk to an attorney.

839
00:56:15,092 --> 00:56:17,606
So I casually read him his rights.

840
00:56:17,732 --> 00:56:19,962
Then he sits down on the guy's desk.

841
00:56:20,492 --> 00:56:23,882
And his eyes get bigger
and he starts double-talking like crazy.

842
00:56:23,972 --> 00:56:25,963
I know that there's something there.

843
00:56:26,052 --> 00:56:27,963
Mr. Weiss, I think we got him.

844
00:56:29,932 --> 00:56:31,001
Got who?

845
00:56:31,252 --> 00:56:33,163
Sherman McCoy. We got him.

846
00:56:33,412 --> 00:56:34,845
You think it's him?

847
00:56:35,492 --> 00:56:38,052
It's him! This guy is Park Avenue.

848
00:56:38,212 --> 00:56:42,683
His father ran Dunning, Sponget and Leach.
His wife is a socialite.

849
00:56:42,772 --> 00:56:45,161
Does this put an end
to this white-justice shit?

850
00:56:45,252 --> 00:56:47,004
We have zip on him.

851
00:56:47,172 --> 00:56:50,289
We could bring him in for questioning,
then go public.

852
00:56:51,172 --> 00:56:54,960
Go public? With what?
The only witness is in a coma, likely to die.

853
00:56:55,492 --> 00:56:57,881
Don't listen. You got a speech to make.

854
00:56:58,252 --> 00:57:00,766
Send a signal to the poor people
of the city.

855
00:57:00,932 --> 00:57:02,604
Let them know justice is blind.

856
00:57:02,692 --> 00:57:06,765
Let them know that rich whites
get the same treatment as poor blacks.

857
00:57:06,892 --> 00:57:08,928
You must give the people hope.

858
00:57:09,572 --> 00:57:11,802
You mean, we nail the WASP?

859
00:57:12,052 --> 00:57:13,565
To the wall.

860
00:57:15,892 --> 00:57:17,610
I like this man.

861
00:57:18,892 --> 00:57:21,611
So I tell him, "I'm your lawyer
from Legal Aid."

862
00:57:21,732 --> 00:57:25,645
He says, "I don't want a nigger lawyer.
I want a Jew."

863
00:57:25,892 --> 00:57:26,927
Nice guy.

864
00:57:27,012 --> 00:57:31,449
- It's his third drug arrest. He wants a deal.
- He'll say he was at the scene?

865
00:57:31,732 --> 00:57:34,246
He'll say whatever you want him to say.

866
00:57:34,732 --> 00:57:38,725
Get me Andruitti. Tell him it's urgent
about this Lamb shit.

867
00:57:39,172 --> 00:57:43,723
Suppose this other fellow comes forward.
There was another fellow. He was big...

868
00:57:44,132 --> 00:57:48,648
I believe you. It was a set-up.
They were going to rob you.

869
00:57:48,932 --> 00:57:51,492
He has good reasons not to come forward.

870
00:57:51,692 --> 00:57:53,728
Now, you just sit tight.

871
00:57:54,372 --> 00:57:58,684
Look, you were recommended
as the best criminal lawyer around.

872
00:57:58,892 --> 00:58:01,247
But I didn't come here to...

873
00:58:01,572 --> 00:58:05,611
I want to preempt this situation.
I don't want it to go any further.

874
00:58:06,212 --> 00:58:07,440
What does that mean?

875
00:58:07,532 --> 00:58:09,648
I want to take the initiative.

876
00:58:09,892 --> 00:58:12,247
I want to go to the police with Maria...

877
00:58:12,332 --> 00:58:15,210
...with Mrs. Ruskin,
and tell them what happened.

878
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:19,007
I feel morally certain
that what we did was right...

879
00:58:19,252 --> 00:58:21,368
...in the circumstances we were in.

880
00:58:22,252 --> 00:58:25,289
Yeah, you Wall Street honchos
are real gamblers.

881
00:58:28,012 --> 00:58:29,923
What are you, nuts?

882
00:58:30,692 --> 00:58:32,922
They will devour you.

883
00:58:33,172 --> 00:58:34,685
- Eat you alive.
- Why?

884
00:58:35,332 --> 00:58:37,607
Forget that it's a political football.

885
00:58:37,732 --> 00:58:40,644
Forget about the TV and Reverend Bacon...

886
00:58:40,932 --> 00:58:43,162
...and Weiss's upcoming election.

887
00:58:43,372 --> 00:58:47,570
Remember that everyday, the Bronx DA
prosecutes people with names...

888
00:58:47,812 --> 00:58:50,531
...like Tiffany Latour, Sancho Rodriguez...

889
00:58:51,332 --> 00:58:54,404
...Chong Wong and Shabazz Tamali.

890
00:58:54,692 --> 00:58:59,322
So he's dying to get his hands on a nice
white couple like you and Mrs. Ruskin.

891
00:58:59,972 --> 00:59:01,769
I mean, Biscuit City.

892
00:59:02,052 --> 00:59:04,486
Open your mouth and they will arrest you.

893
00:59:04,612 --> 00:59:10,050
They will make a big show of the arrest.
It will be very unpleasant. Guaranteed.

894
00:59:10,252 --> 00:59:13,210
And you don't want to be arrested
in the South Bronx.

895
00:59:17,412 --> 00:59:18,845
Put him on.

896
00:59:19,732 --> 00:59:20,801
I'll hold.

897
00:59:21,092 --> 00:59:23,560
I'll need to talk to Mrs. Ruskin too.

898
00:59:25,132 --> 00:59:27,009
I understand you went to Yale.

899
00:59:27,652 --> 00:59:29,404
Yeah. You too?

900
00:59:30,852 --> 00:59:32,365
What did you think of it?

901
00:59:32,452 --> 00:59:35,489
It was okay, as law schools go.

902
00:59:35,692 --> 00:59:38,206
They give you the scholarly view.

903
00:59:38,452 --> 00:59:43,048
And it's good for anything you want to do
that doesn't involve real people.

904
00:59:45,572 --> 00:59:47,847
Andruitti, you guinea bastard!

905
00:59:52,772 --> 00:59:55,809
I'm sitting here with Mr. Sherman McCoy.

906
01:00:00,812 --> 01:00:03,804
I don't know if he needs a lawyer.
What do you think?

907
01:00:06,212 --> 01:00:08,123
Okay. So what does that mean?

908
01:00:16,292 --> 01:00:17,930
We got a problem.

909
01:00:19,012 --> 01:00:20,411
What is it?

910
01:00:20,772 --> 01:00:22,603
They're going to arrest you.

911
01:00:24,132 --> 01:00:28,444
<i>While Sherman faced catastrophe</i>
<i>in his career and in his marriage...</i>

912
01:00:28,612 --> 01:00:32,605
<i>... and while the police were circling,</i>
<i>while his life hung in the balance...</i>

913
01:00:32,692 --> 01:00:34,603
<i>... Sherman went to the opera.</i>

914
01:01:37,252 --> 01:01:38,731
There he is...

915
01:01:39,052 --> 01:01:43,011
Don Juan in the vise-like grip of fate...

916
01:01:43,332 --> 01:01:47,484
...facing his crime, facing his entire life
of selfish consumption...

917
01:01:47,652 --> 01:01:50,371
...and profligate wasting
of himself and others.

918
01:01:53,412 --> 01:01:55,243
You're Judy McCoy's husband.

919
01:01:57,172 --> 01:01:59,402
Have you met Aubrey Buffing, the poet?

920
01:01:59,492 --> 01:02:02,529
He's up for the Nobel Prize. He has AIDS.

921
01:02:04,132 --> 01:02:05,645
We were talking about the opera.

922
01:02:05,732 --> 01:02:08,007
The wrath of heaven must be at hand.

923
01:02:08,292 --> 01:02:10,362
Its justice will not tarry.

924
01:02:11,092 --> 01:02:15,005
I see the deadly thunderbolt
poised above his head!

925
01:02:15,332 --> 01:02:17,402
<i>Suddenly, he saw her in the crowd.</i>

926
01:02:18,052 --> 01:02:19,326
<i>Maria!</i>

927
01:02:23,012 --> 01:02:27,324
<i>He followed her past the grinning faces</i>
<i>full of boiling teeth.</i>

928
01:02:27,652 --> 01:02:29,244
<i>Past the conversational bouquets.</i>

929
01:02:29,332 --> 01:02:32,483
<i>Past the impeccably emaciated</i>
<i>ladies of society.</i>

930
01:02:32,812 --> 01:02:34,689
<i>The social X-ray women.</i>

931
01:02:34,892 --> 01:02:37,201
<i>Christ, was this the world he lived in?</i>

932
01:02:37,972 --> 01:02:41,362
<i>Before he answered the question</i>
<i>he saw Maria being introduced...</i>

933
01:02:41,452 --> 01:02:42,851
<i>... to his wife.</i>

934
01:02:53,252 --> 01:02:55,163
Maria's just back from Italy.

935
01:02:55,372 --> 01:02:57,010
She lives on airplanes.

936
01:02:57,092 --> 01:03:00,243
She goes back and forth
from Italy like a Ping-Pong ball.

937
01:03:06,092 --> 01:03:08,208
Have you met Nunnally Voyd?

938
01:03:08,612 --> 01:03:10,045
At last.

939
01:03:10,852 --> 01:03:13,127
Bobby Shalfet from the opera.

940
01:03:15,492 --> 01:03:17,084
And Arthur Ruskin.

941
01:03:19,332 --> 01:03:21,163
And his wife, Maria.

942
01:03:22,532 --> 01:03:23,965
We've met.

943
01:03:29,412 --> 01:03:32,802
Couldn't you try just once
to be a little bit interesting?

944
01:03:32,972 --> 01:03:35,486
I wanted you to meet Aubrey Buffing.

945
01:03:36,172 --> 01:03:39,323
Aubrey Buffing. He's on the short list
for the Nobel Prize.

946
01:03:39,412 --> 01:03:41,323
He has AIDS. You'll love him.

947
01:03:43,172 --> 01:03:46,847
We are in the middle of the room,
a married couple talking to each other.

948
01:03:46,932 --> 01:03:49,844
You simply don't do it. Go mingle. Please.

949
01:03:51,212 --> 01:03:55,046
And even when repentance is offered,
he refuses.

950
01:03:55,372 --> 01:03:57,442
He refuses to deny his life.

951
01:03:57,732 --> 01:04:00,929
The food, the drink, the flesh...

952
01:04:01,132 --> 01:04:04,647
...fatal as they may be,
he cannot resist them.

953
01:04:24,172 --> 01:04:26,208
Maria, may I speak to you?

954
01:04:26,372 --> 01:04:28,203
We have to stop meeting like this.

955
01:04:28,292 --> 01:04:30,522
Do you know Boris, the ballet dancer?

956
01:04:34,732 --> 01:04:37,121
- He's defective.
- You mean, he defected.

957
01:04:37,292 --> 01:04:39,681
No, I mean he doesn't speak English.

958
01:04:40,132 --> 01:04:41,690
Really? Are you sure?

959
01:04:42,212 --> 01:04:43,884
Do you know what's going on?

960
01:04:43,972 --> 01:04:46,406
Boris, want me to eat your ass?

961
01:04:49,012 --> 01:04:51,401
You see? It went right over his head.

962
01:04:51,532 --> 01:04:54,524
- We have to talk.
- Of course we do.

963
01:04:54,772 --> 01:04:57,650
But keep smiling because
my husband is watching.

964
01:04:59,012 --> 01:05:01,082
He's so pleased with himself.

965
01:05:01,292 --> 01:05:06,571
He's just closed a new deal.
Charter business. He'll fly Arabs to Mecca.

966
01:05:06,692 --> 01:05:09,889
- I'm going to be arrested.
- The planes are from Israel.

967
01:05:10,052 --> 01:05:11,371
By the police.

968
01:05:11,572 --> 01:05:13,722
He'll make a goddamn fortune.

969
01:05:13,892 --> 01:05:15,723
My lawyer, if you can call him that...

970
01:05:15,812 --> 01:05:19,964
He called me a whore today!
Right in front of the servants!

971
01:05:21,092 --> 01:05:24,323
Really! How does he expect me
to run the house...

972
01:05:24,532 --> 01:05:27,490
...if he humiliates me in front of the help?

973
01:05:27,972 --> 01:05:29,724
You have a point.

974
01:05:31,532 --> 01:05:34,808
I'm sorry. What are we talking about?

975
01:05:36,292 --> 01:05:39,329
The other guy's come forward.
Says I was driving.

976
01:05:39,692 --> 01:05:41,762
I'm going to be arrested tomorrow.

977
01:05:41,892 --> 01:05:45,567
I need to know from you
what you want me to say.

978
01:05:46,732 --> 01:05:49,610
Maria, darling, I need your advice
about something.

979
01:05:49,972 --> 01:05:52,645
Sherman, have you met Aubrey Buffing?

980
01:05:55,052 --> 01:05:56,770
Like so many of us...

981
01:05:56,972 --> 01:06:02,444
...until Death itself takes us into his arms
and burns us with the fever of living...

982
01:06:02,732 --> 01:06:06,691
...dragging us like Don Juan
into the bonfires of hell!

983
01:06:07,172 --> 01:06:09,891
The voice of the ghost ringing in our ears!

984
01:06:10,132 --> 01:06:11,565
"Repent!"

985
01:06:26,852 --> 01:06:30,925
Careful. My kid got Styrofoam shit
back there and it sticks to your clothes.

986
01:06:31,012 --> 01:06:32,923
- How do you feel?
- Top notch.

987
01:06:33,092 --> 01:06:34,810
This is just a formality, right?

988
01:06:34,892 --> 01:06:36,803
No problem. They promised me.

989
01:06:37,772 --> 01:06:41,924
I told Maria. I saw her last night.
In case we need her.

990
01:06:42,092 --> 01:06:44,970
That explains it.
She left the country this morning.

991
01:06:45,172 --> 01:06:48,164
You know an Italian painter
named Filippo Chirazzi?

992
01:06:49,892 --> 01:06:52,611
I think your girlfriend's
got a new boyfriend.

993
01:06:52,932 --> 01:06:55,492
It won't be so bad. This is routine.

994
01:06:55,732 --> 01:06:58,405
Andruitti promised we'll be in
and out of there.

995
01:06:58,972 --> 01:07:00,928
No one will ever know what happened.

996
01:07:01,012 --> 01:07:02,047
Cuff him.

997
01:07:03,892 --> 01:07:06,486
The zone captain will be there.
And the press.

998
01:07:06,692 --> 01:07:09,081
What the fuck? What press?

999
01:07:09,412 --> 01:07:11,482
Ray promised no bullshit.

1000
01:07:11,692 --> 01:07:14,729
Weiss gave the order this morning.

1001
01:07:16,012 --> 01:07:18,082
Somebody's going to pay for this.

1002
01:07:24,812 --> 01:07:26,928
<i>I made sure I was there that day.</i>

1003
01:07:27,652 --> 01:07:29,882
<i>That day would be full of revelations.</i>

1004
01:07:30,092 --> 01:07:32,322
<i>I would meet Sherman McCoy at last.</i>

1005
01:07:32,612 --> 01:07:34,443
<i>When he finally appeared...</i>

1006
01:07:35,692 --> 01:07:38,365
<i>Well, excuse me, what the hell...?</i>

1007
01:07:38,852 --> 01:07:41,730
<i>Who were these people?</i>
<i>What were they doing here?</i>

1008
01:07:41,892 --> 01:07:43,245
<i>This was my story!</i>

1009
01:07:43,332 --> 01:07:46,529
<i>Sherman McCoy was my baby!</i>
<i>My creation!</i>

1010
01:07:58,412 --> 01:08:00,801
Look at these punks. Get out of here!

1011
01:08:01,132 --> 01:08:02,724
Why'd you hit that kid?

1012
01:08:03,012 --> 01:08:05,128
Put the cuffs on him.

1013
01:08:07,852 --> 01:08:09,205
I'm going to jail, aren't I?

1014
01:08:09,292 --> 01:08:12,921
Don't say a word. Don't hide your head.

1015
01:08:13,132 --> 01:08:15,202
You don't even know they're there.

1016
01:08:15,492 --> 01:08:17,448
I'm going to jail.

1017
01:08:28,452 --> 01:08:30,682
What do you have to say for yourself?

1018
01:08:31,532 --> 01:08:33,204
You been arrested before?

1019
01:08:33,412 --> 01:08:35,642
Where's your wife?

1020
01:08:35,852 --> 01:08:39,481
You ran down Mrs. Lamb's son.
Have you anything to say to her?

1021
01:08:39,652 --> 01:08:42,689
Here! Let me take your picture, shithead!

1022
01:08:42,892 --> 01:08:45,645
How do you like this cocktail party?

1023
01:08:48,812 --> 01:08:50,450
Hello, Mr. McCoy.

1024
01:08:50,692 --> 01:08:53,729
Don't make any statements!
Don't talk to anybody!

1025
01:08:53,932 --> 01:08:56,002
I'll meet you at the arraignment.

1026
01:10:01,092 --> 01:10:03,811
Quiet! You people sit down!

1027
01:10:04,132 --> 01:10:05,406
Shut up!

1028
01:10:22,612 --> 01:10:25,843
Do you know the charges
that have been brought against you?

1029
01:10:27,812 --> 01:10:28,767
What?

1030
01:10:31,172 --> 01:10:33,640
How do you plead to the charges?

1031
01:10:36,452 --> 01:10:37,771
I'm sorry.

1032
01:10:39,892 --> 01:10:42,565
I am very sorry. Please forgive me.

1033
01:10:48,172 --> 01:10:52,131
I am truly sorry for everything.
Please forgive me.

1034
01:10:52,372 --> 01:10:54,681
For my life. For everything.

1035
01:10:55,172 --> 01:10:56,446
I'm truly sorry.

1036
01:10:57,292 --> 01:10:58,407
Shut up!

1037
01:10:58,612 --> 01:11:00,648
The defendant pleads not guilty.

1038
01:11:04,652 --> 01:11:07,246
Bail has been set at $10,000.

1039
01:11:12,172 --> 01:11:13,571
Order! Order!

1040
01:11:14,572 --> 01:11:16,164
You people sit down!

1041
01:11:24,532 --> 01:11:28,366
We do not believe it will serve
the interests of justice...

1042
01:11:28,612 --> 01:11:30,842
...to allow this man to walk free...

1043
01:11:31,732 --> 01:11:33,768
...on a token bail.

1044
01:11:35,572 --> 01:11:40,646
Mr. Kramer knows perfectly well
that my client won't jump bail!

1045
01:11:40,852 --> 01:11:43,241
Think of the emotions of this community!

1046
01:11:49,492 --> 01:11:53,326
That is patent nonsense.
Bail has already been agreed to.

1047
01:11:53,612 --> 01:11:59,687
Mr. Weiss has instructed me to ask
for bail in the amount of $250,000.

1048
01:12:00,172 --> 01:12:01,491
Cash!

1049
01:12:09,412 --> 01:12:13,963
If your office has any information
bearing on bail status of this case...

1050
01:12:14,212 --> 01:12:16,168
...make a formal application.

1051
01:12:16,852 --> 01:12:18,490
Meanwhile, I release Mr. McCoy...

1052
01:12:18,572 --> 01:12:20,961
...under a bond in the amount of $10,000.

1053
01:12:21,172 --> 01:12:23,447
Now get this sideshow out of my court!

1054
01:12:26,572 --> 01:12:30,690
Your Honor, your action will irreparably
damage not only the people's case...

1055
01:12:30,892 --> 01:12:32,325
I have spoken!

1056
01:12:33,252 --> 01:12:35,482
...but the people's cause as well.

1057
01:12:36,652 --> 01:12:39,120
It ill-behooves the criminal justice system!

1058
01:12:39,212 --> 01:12:41,362
Kindly behoove me no "ill-behooves."

1059
01:12:43,012 --> 01:12:45,242
The court directs you to shut up!

1060
01:12:49,412 --> 01:12:53,451
He's coming out the back! Fall out!
He's coming out the back!

1061
01:12:53,732 --> 01:12:55,051
Go get him!

1062
01:12:56,332 --> 01:12:57,651
Get him.

1063
01:12:58,892 --> 01:13:01,008
He's getting away!

1064
01:13:05,572 --> 01:13:07,005
He's getting away.

1065
01:13:17,252 --> 01:13:19,971
<i>So much for my introduction</i>
<i>to Sherman McCoy.</i>

1066
01:13:20,692 --> 01:13:23,570
<i>Before we could even speak,</i>
<i>he had been swept away.</i>

1067
01:13:25,012 --> 01:13:28,129
<i>I began to appreciate the power,</i>
<i>the magnitude...</i>

1068
01:13:28,292 --> 01:13:31,523
<i>... the sheer force unleashed</i>
<i>by my little story.</i>

1069
01:13:34,412 --> 01:13:35,686
<i>Jackals.</i>

1070
01:13:36,172 --> 01:13:37,605
<i>These dogs...</i>

1071
01:13:38,052 --> 01:13:40,361
<i>... yapping at the heels of their prey.</i>

1072
01:13:40,612 --> 01:13:42,887
<i>And my God, I was one of them.</i>

1073
01:13:43,372 --> 01:13:45,932
<i>Let them have it. Enough is enough.</i>

1074
01:13:46,412 --> 01:13:49,609
<i>With what little dignity I had left,</i>
<i>I decided to go home.</i>

1075
01:13:56,292 --> 01:13:59,807
Excuse me. Do you know
where I can find a taxi?

1076
01:14:06,852 --> 01:14:07,921
Sherman McCoy.

1077
01:14:08,012 --> 01:14:09,730
Yeah, I know who you are.

1078
01:14:13,492 --> 01:14:16,848
- What are you doing out here?
- I need a taxi.

1079
01:14:17,092 --> 01:14:19,162
There he is! There's McCoy!

1080
01:14:22,892 --> 01:14:25,486
You need to get out of here. Come on.

1081
01:14:26,692 --> 01:14:28,842
We'll get out of here on the subway.

1082
01:14:29,092 --> 01:14:32,004
I don't usually travel in the subway.

1083
01:14:48,052 --> 01:14:50,043
I owe you an apology.

1084
01:14:50,252 --> 01:14:52,129
No, you were very helpful.

1085
01:14:52,292 --> 01:14:55,170
- You don't know who I am.
- It's all right. Thanks.

1086
01:14:57,652 --> 01:14:59,085
I should go.

1087
01:14:59,332 --> 01:15:01,288
Go where? You're on a train.

1088
01:15:03,532 --> 01:15:05,443
Come over here and sit down.

1089
01:15:09,452 --> 01:15:11,363
I'll make sure you get home.

1090
01:15:23,372 --> 01:15:25,602
- Want some?
- No thanks.

1091
01:15:25,892 --> 01:15:27,211
Fuck it.

1092
01:15:27,972 --> 01:15:29,246
What'll they do?

1093
01:15:29,612 --> 01:15:31,045
Arrest you?

1094
01:15:42,852 --> 01:15:46,242
Does this train go
anywhere near Park Avenue?

1095
01:15:47,572 --> 01:15:49,767
Not for the last million years.

1096
01:15:51,812 --> 01:15:55,043
My father rode the subway
every day of his life.

1097
01:15:57,572 --> 01:16:00,291
He didn't live in the South Bronx, though.

1098
01:16:05,092 --> 01:16:06,525
I look terrible.

1099
01:16:08,092 --> 01:16:09,525
You look like shit.

1100
01:16:10,532 --> 01:16:12,443
You don't smell good, either.

1101
01:16:17,932 --> 01:16:21,447
I think when I was in jail
I pissed in my pants.

1102
01:16:34,612 --> 01:16:35,840
Take it easy.

1103
01:16:36,332 --> 01:16:37,606
I'm all right.

1104
01:16:39,412 --> 01:16:40,731
I can't think.

1105
01:16:41,532 --> 01:16:43,011
Cheer yourself up.

1106
01:17:01,892 --> 01:17:05,123
Then this newspaper thing started.
This Peter Fallow.

1107
01:17:05,412 --> 01:17:09,087
Everything was wrong.
Total disregard for the truth.

1108
01:17:09,292 --> 01:17:10,645
This is your stop.

1109
01:17:10,732 --> 01:17:15,169
Everyone calls me by my first name,
like they know me. Like they own me.

1110
01:17:15,412 --> 01:17:20,008
Lawyers, police, newspapers.
How did I get to be so important?

1111
01:17:20,332 --> 01:17:24,166
You're not important. You're dinner.
Don't you get it?

1112
01:17:24,772 --> 01:17:28,287
A week from now,
they won't even remember what they ate.

1113
01:17:28,772 --> 01:17:30,683
Thank you for everything.

1114
01:17:30,892 --> 01:17:35,568
I should have just called the police
right away. Right when it happened.

1115
01:17:35,852 --> 01:17:38,924
But it really wasn't my decision to make.

1116
01:17:39,172 --> 01:17:40,844
I wasn't driving the car.

1117
01:17:52,012 --> 01:17:54,082
It's going to be fine.

1118
01:18:32,972 --> 01:18:34,451
- What do we want?
- Justice!

1119
01:18:34,532 --> 01:18:36,124
- What do we get?
- Racism!

1120
01:18:55,852 --> 01:18:58,889
It's Sherman! A bravo, everybody!

1121
01:19:12,652 --> 01:19:15,883
You sly fox. Don't let the newspapers
keep you down.

1122
01:19:16,132 --> 01:19:18,202
The press are bloody fruit flies.

1123
01:19:18,372 --> 01:19:20,840
They hover over the feces.
Just swipe them away.

1124
01:19:20,932 --> 01:19:23,321
But they always come back to the shit.

1125
01:19:23,972 --> 01:19:26,042
I always thought you were dull.

1126
01:19:31,532 --> 01:19:32,965
Congratulations.

1127
01:19:33,652 --> 01:19:36,530
Has anybody talked to you
about television?

1128
01:19:36,772 --> 01:19:39,889
We'd have to play down the racial thing.

1129
01:19:40,012 --> 01:19:42,287
Kind of make you more sympathetic.

1130
01:19:42,692 --> 01:19:47,208
I know I'm first, but I wanted to be there
before the corpse was cold.

1131
01:19:47,812 --> 01:19:49,211
$200,000.

1132
01:19:49,292 --> 01:19:51,681
- I beg your pardon?
- Fuck my pardon.

1133
01:19:51,972 --> 01:19:54,281
I'll suck your dick for the rights. $250,000.

1134
01:19:54,372 --> 01:19:58,411
A book, a mini-series. $500,000.
Go to jail, double.

1135
01:19:58,692 --> 01:20:01,570
- Is that a great blow job or what?
- Excuse me!

1136
01:20:07,972 --> 01:20:10,281
Didn't mean anything to interrupt anything.

1137
01:20:10,372 --> 01:20:12,124
Gene asked me to come by.

1138
01:20:13,252 --> 01:20:15,402
I haven't talked with anyone yet.

1139
01:20:15,532 --> 01:20:17,727
If there's anything we can do...

1140
01:20:19,492 --> 01:20:21,722
I'll be back to work in a day or two.

1141
01:20:21,892 --> 01:20:25,726
That won't be necessary.
That's what I was sent to...

1142
01:20:25,972 --> 01:20:27,405
You don't have to.

1143
01:20:28,132 --> 01:20:30,851
I mean, you shouldn't come down.

1144
01:20:31,972 --> 01:20:34,122
They don't want you to come down.

1145
01:20:35,172 --> 01:20:36,924
Sherman, I'm sorry.

1146
01:20:37,252 --> 01:20:40,369
Between this and the way you handled
the Giscard deal...

1147
01:20:40,452 --> 01:20:43,489
- I mean, $600,000,000 is a...
- This is final?

1148
01:20:43,732 --> 01:20:45,927
Well, the firm feels that...

1149
01:20:47,092 --> 01:20:48,445
I'm sorry.

1150
01:21:07,372 --> 01:21:09,761
Judy, could we... What's going on?

1151
01:21:09,932 --> 01:21:14,562
This dinner party was planned weeks ago,
if you bothered to check your calendar.

1152
01:21:16,372 --> 01:21:18,090
Under the circumstances...

1153
01:21:18,172 --> 01:21:21,403
I know the whole story.
I saw it on television.

1154
01:21:23,172 --> 01:21:25,561
I'm sorry. Judy, I am.

1155
01:21:26,092 --> 01:21:29,801
You betrayed us. Me. Campbell.
Even yourself.

1156
01:21:30,292 --> 01:21:34,604
But I'm chairing the museum benefit
thanks to your escapades.

1157
01:21:35,092 --> 01:21:37,128
What can I say? Life goes on.

1158
01:21:37,412 --> 01:21:40,370
I'll make the best of an appalling situation.

1159
01:21:40,932 --> 01:21:43,002
Can you forgive me?

1160
01:21:46,132 --> 01:21:50,444
I suppose I can forgive anything,
but not television.

1161
01:21:52,172 --> 01:21:53,571
I'm leaving you.

1162
01:21:56,292 --> 01:21:57,725
After the party.

1163
01:21:58,532 --> 01:22:01,251
Now if you will excuse me,
we have guests.

1164
01:22:04,972 --> 01:22:08,806
I'm terribly sorry to bother you.
Is this a bad time?

1165
01:22:12,932 --> 01:22:14,445
The more the merrier.

1166
01:22:14,572 --> 01:22:17,245
I've been in touch with the co-op board.

1167
01:22:17,452 --> 01:22:20,205
We want you to know
you have our support.

1168
01:22:22,052 --> 01:22:23,963
You know, I wanted to die...

1169
01:22:24,172 --> 01:22:27,403
...with everybody calling my name
in that courtroom.

1170
01:22:27,652 --> 01:22:29,529
Of course. It's hard to believe.

1171
01:22:29,612 --> 01:22:32,809
And then I thought, "I have a gun."

1172
01:22:34,372 --> 01:22:36,283
A 12-gauge, pump action.

1173
01:22:36,532 --> 01:22:38,682
We've known each other a long time.

1174
01:22:38,932 --> 01:22:41,651
We went to Buckley together.
My father knew your father.

1175
01:22:41,732 --> 01:22:44,485
I speak as a friend and also for the board.

1176
01:22:44,692 --> 01:22:46,922
How do I get the barrels into my mouth?

1177
01:22:47,012 --> 01:22:49,606
How am I going to pull the trigger?

1178
01:22:49,772 --> 01:22:52,969
I read about a man who took off his shoe...

1179
01:22:53,252 --> 01:22:55,561
...and pulled the trigger with his toe.

1180
01:22:57,772 --> 01:23:00,366
This can't be a comfortable situation
for you.

1181
01:23:03,412 --> 01:23:04,606
Is that a gun?

1182
01:23:07,532 --> 01:23:09,170
Where would I do it?

1183
01:23:09,772 --> 01:23:11,842
And who would find me?

1184
01:23:12,172 --> 01:23:13,764
Yes, exactly.

1185
01:23:14,052 --> 01:23:15,804
Have you considered...

1186
01:23:16,772 --> 01:23:18,842
...changing residence for a while?

1187
01:23:21,932 --> 01:23:23,490
You want me to leave?

1188
01:23:26,852 --> 01:23:28,365
This is my home.

1189
01:23:29,332 --> 01:23:33,450
I have no safe place to go.
People are threatening my life.

1190
01:23:33,892 --> 01:23:35,450
I must protect myself.

1191
01:23:37,532 --> 01:23:42,162
People are demonstrating out front.
Black people with basketballs.

1192
01:23:42,332 --> 01:23:44,402
You're putting everyone at risk!

1193
01:23:44,492 --> 01:23:47,086
It's not your fault. But that's the fact.

1194
01:23:47,372 --> 01:23:49,761
If you're so scared, you move out.

1195
01:23:50,692 --> 01:23:51,647
Please.

1196
01:23:52,172 --> 01:23:53,321
Start...

1197
01:23:54,292 --> 01:23:56,601
...by moving out of my apartment now.

1198
01:23:56,772 --> 01:23:58,683
I came here in good faith.

1199
01:23:59,492 --> 01:24:00,607
Now, out!

1200
01:24:02,572 --> 01:24:05,086
You were a fat blowhard at Buckley...

1201
01:24:05,252 --> 01:24:07,288
...and you're a fat blowhard now!

1202
01:24:07,372 --> 01:24:10,409
I'll enforce the provision
on unacceptable situations.

1203
01:24:10,692 --> 01:24:14,844
Another word and you'll have
an unacceptable situation up your ass!

1204
01:24:16,292 --> 01:24:17,566
March!

1205
01:24:23,572 --> 01:24:26,564
That goes for the rest of you too! Out!

1206
01:24:36,772 --> 01:24:38,524
I said, "Get out!"

1207
01:24:41,932 --> 01:24:44,207
Parasites! Everybody out!

1208
01:24:44,492 --> 01:24:47,689
Out of my house! Out of my apartment!

1209
01:24:50,212 --> 01:24:51,531
Out of my life!

1210
01:24:56,612 --> 01:24:59,001
Sherman McCoy is dead!

1211
01:24:59,372 --> 01:25:02,921
Sherman McCoy of Park Avenue
and Wall Street...

1212
01:25:04,932 --> 01:25:09,210
...will never be Sherman McCoy again!

1213
01:25:14,732 --> 01:25:19,248
<i>Meanwhile, just a few blocks away,</i>
<i>I was being praised and congratulated.</i>

1214
01:25:19,652 --> 01:25:22,530
<i>It should have been</i>
<i>a triumphant yours truly...</i>

1215
01:25:22,892 --> 01:25:24,245
<i>... but it wasn't.</i>

1216
01:25:24,932 --> 01:25:28,447
<i>My encounter with the real</i>
<i>Sherman McCoy was spoiling everything.</i>

1217
01:25:29,092 --> 01:25:30,684
<i>Truth has a way of doing that.</i>

1218
01:25:30,772 --> 01:25:32,285
Daddy, dinner.

1219
01:25:32,452 --> 01:25:36,286
- Yes. Shall we take Peter with us?
- Lovely.

1220
01:25:36,532 --> 01:25:39,330
Pay full attention to this story.

1221
01:25:39,532 --> 01:25:42,842
We look better and better
the more we do for the Lambs.

1222
01:25:43,012 --> 01:25:45,287
These poor little Lambs.

1223
01:25:45,572 --> 01:25:47,961
These fuzzy-wuzzy little wogs!

1224
01:25:51,892 --> 01:25:54,360
Phone call for you in the office.

1225
01:25:55,332 --> 01:25:58,881
Thank you. I'm expecting a call
about the story.

1226
01:25:59,212 --> 01:26:01,885
I'll see you at dinner. Thank you.

1227
01:26:18,692 --> 01:26:20,125
Where's the phone?

1228
01:26:20,332 --> 01:26:21,765
I lied.

1229
01:26:22,532 --> 01:26:24,762
I wanted to see you alone.

1230
01:26:26,092 --> 01:26:28,481
I'm going to do you a favor.

1231
01:26:28,852 --> 01:26:32,003
Does this mean I'll finally get
into your panties?

1232
01:26:34,892 --> 01:26:37,406
You don't deserve this, Peter.

1233
01:26:39,892 --> 01:26:41,928
I'm going to tell you something.

1234
01:26:42,092 --> 01:26:44,765
I'm with some people right outside.

1235
01:26:46,732 --> 01:26:48,324
Relax, darling.

1236
01:26:51,532 --> 01:26:52,931
Do you remember...

1237
01:26:53,412 --> 01:26:57,724
...my pretty little Italian friend?
The painter.

1238
01:26:59,372 --> 01:27:01,966
Frederico. No. Franco.

1239
01:27:02,212 --> 01:27:03,327
Filippo.

1240
01:27:03,692 --> 01:27:05,125
The shit.

1241
01:27:07,252 --> 01:27:09,163
You are very intoxicated.

1242
01:27:11,172 --> 01:27:15,484
Filippo has run off with a little slut
you should know about.

1243
01:27:19,292 --> 01:27:20,805
Isn't that dangerous?

1244
01:27:23,092 --> 01:27:24,923
At the very least, unsanitary?

1245
01:27:25,012 --> 01:27:26,445
Shut up, Peter.

1246
01:27:26,852 --> 01:27:28,444
You're not listening.

1247
01:27:28,772 --> 01:27:32,606
Her name is Maria Ruskin.

1248
01:27:34,412 --> 01:27:36,801
She was subletting my apartment.

1249
01:27:39,892 --> 01:27:42,360
She was also subletting Filippo.

1250
01:27:45,572 --> 01:27:47,164
As it turns out...

1251
01:27:47,852 --> 01:27:52,607
...she was in the car with Sherman McCoy
when he had his little mishap.

1252
01:27:55,372 --> 01:27:56,930
You're joking.

1253
01:27:57,172 --> 01:27:58,685
I never joke.

1254
01:28:00,812 --> 01:28:03,042
She was in the bloody car.

1255
01:28:05,612 --> 01:28:06,886
How do you know?

1256
01:28:08,692 --> 01:28:10,728
The apartment was bugged.

1257
01:28:12,052 --> 01:28:14,043
They had a wire in the intercom.

1258
01:28:15,652 --> 01:28:18,689
They wanted to prove I wasn't living there.

1259
01:28:19,972 --> 01:28:21,405
Which I wasn't.

1260
01:28:23,172 --> 01:28:26,721
Now I've lost the apartment
and the boyfriend.

1261
01:28:29,932 --> 01:28:31,411
Do you know where they are?

1262
01:28:37,892 --> 01:28:40,964
I am trusting you to find them.

1263
01:28:44,492 --> 01:28:45,925
When you do...

1264
01:28:46,732 --> 01:28:48,450
...give them this.

1265
01:28:50,252 --> 01:28:53,881
Tell them it's from the little twat
who turned them in.

1266
01:28:55,612 --> 01:28:59,048
Thank you for seeing me
on such short notice, Mr. Ruskin.

1267
01:28:59,252 --> 01:29:00,526
Peter Fallow.

1268
01:29:00,692 --> 01:29:03,206
I'm a good friend of your wife.

1269
01:29:03,372 --> 01:29:04,964
My wife. My wife.

1270
01:29:05,292 --> 01:29:08,807
I'm glad she's not here.
Otherwise I couldn't have a drink.

1271
01:29:09,292 --> 01:29:12,489
A Courvoisier VSOP. Put it in a sidecar.

1272
01:29:12,692 --> 01:29:13,761
Where is Maria?

1273
01:29:13,852 --> 01:29:16,366
Italy. She's always in Italy.

1274
01:29:16,652 --> 01:29:19,041
She's young. She needs young people.

1275
01:29:19,212 --> 01:29:20,964
I know what goes on.

1276
01:29:21,132 --> 01:29:23,088
I'll want to talk to her.

1277
01:29:23,252 --> 01:29:24,924
My office has her number.

1278
01:29:27,092 --> 01:29:31,131
I'm not supposed to drink,
but I love a sidecar.

1279
01:29:31,372 --> 01:29:33,442
So you're on <i>The City Light</i>?

1280
01:29:34,012 --> 01:29:37,925
We're profiling the new tycoons.
Naturally, we thought of you.

1281
01:29:38,252 --> 01:29:40,368
Good. Good. I like that.

1282
01:29:40,732 --> 01:29:43,610
New tycoons. What do you want to know?

1283
01:29:45,452 --> 01:29:47,841
The best one happened a few weeks ago.

1284
01:29:49,772 --> 01:29:53,128
My jackass pilot lands long
and the plane goes off the runway.

1285
01:29:53,292 --> 01:29:54,930
I was on the plane.

1286
01:29:55,212 --> 01:29:58,887
We were going to Mecca.
The plane is full of Arabs with animals.

1287
01:29:59,092 --> 01:30:03,290
Goats, sheep, chickens. They don't
go anywhere without their animals.

1288
01:30:03,572 --> 01:30:07,406
We had to put plastic in the cabins.
They urinate, they defecate.

1289
01:30:07,692 --> 01:30:12,891
Anyway, the plane goes off the runway
and lands into that sand with a jolt!

1290
01:30:13,132 --> 01:30:17,683
The right wing tip digs into the sand
and spins around in a circle.

1291
01:30:18,092 --> 01:30:21,767
Three hundred and sixty degrees.
I'm scared shitless. Panic!

1292
01:30:22,252 --> 01:30:26,086
I look in the cabin. In there, calm, quiet...

1293
01:30:26,412 --> 01:30:29,290
...they're picking up their luggage
and animals...

1294
01:30:29,492 --> 01:30:32,848
...and looking out the window
at a little fire on the wings.

1295
01:30:33,052 --> 01:30:36,488
They're waiting for the doors
to open like nothing happened!

1296
01:30:36,692 --> 01:30:38,330
Then it dawns on me.

1297
01:30:38,612 --> 01:30:40,364
They think it's normal!

1298
01:30:42,452 --> 01:30:44,329
That's how you stop a plane!

1299
01:30:44,572 --> 01:30:47,769
Stick the wing in the sand
and let it spin until it stops!

1300
01:30:52,652 --> 01:30:55,849
They'd never been on a plane before!
What do they know?

1301
01:30:56,172 --> 01:30:58,242
They think this is how you do it!

1302
01:31:15,692 --> 01:31:16,966
Mrs. Ruskin?

1303
01:31:17,212 --> 01:31:20,488
I'm Peter Fallow.
I want to express my sympathies.

1304
01:31:20,692 --> 01:31:22,284
How very kind.

1305
01:31:22,612 --> 01:31:24,170
Did you know Arthur?

1306
01:31:24,332 --> 01:31:27,290
Actually, I was quite close to him
when he died.

1307
01:31:29,132 --> 01:31:33,762
I have reprobated myself,
over and over again, for not being there.

1308
01:31:34,092 --> 01:31:37,129
I understand that
you're Sherman McCoy's lover.

1309
01:31:37,452 --> 01:31:38,521
Excuse me?

1310
01:31:38,612 --> 01:31:42,924
And that you were driving the car
on the night of that unfortunate accident.

1311
01:31:43,212 --> 01:31:46,966
- Sherman would never tell you that.
- Tell me what happened that night.

1312
01:31:47,052 --> 01:31:49,441
Listen, Mr. Peckerhead.

1313
01:31:49,852 --> 01:31:53,003
I am here for my husband's funeral.
Understand?

1314
01:31:53,292 --> 01:31:56,204
Go away. Disappear. Disintegrate.

1315
01:31:59,092 --> 01:32:02,926
<i>Yes, yes, yes. This story</i>
<i>was getting better every day.</i>

1316
01:32:03,412 --> 01:32:04,811
<i>I could smell it.</i>

1317
01:32:05,452 --> 01:32:07,522
<i>Hell, some of it was even true.</i>

1318
01:32:08,692 --> 01:32:12,048
<i>I was back on track.</i>
<i>I was a reporter again.</i>

1319
01:32:16,652 --> 01:32:19,689
You're a muckraking yellow journalist!

1320
01:32:19,852 --> 01:32:24,323
You print this story without so much
as a by-your-leave to me or the Reverend.

1321
01:32:24,692 --> 01:32:26,250
Who do you think you are?

1322
01:32:26,332 --> 01:32:28,050
For chrissakes, calm down.

1323
01:32:28,372 --> 01:32:31,045
You have to keep your voices down.

1324
01:32:32,972 --> 01:32:36,885
Sherman McCoy was not driving the car.
I think I can prove it.

1325
01:32:37,012 --> 01:32:38,001
So what?

1326
01:32:38,092 --> 01:32:41,801
This is our case. Right here.
The hospital is the guilty party.

1327
01:32:42,252 --> 01:32:43,526
The hospital?

1328
01:32:43,732 --> 01:32:47,566
The hospital. A young man comes in
with a cerebral concussion.

1329
01:32:47,852 --> 01:32:49,570
They treat him for a broken wrist.

1330
01:32:49,652 --> 01:32:53,691
That is our case. That is the lawsuit
we'll bring against the hospital.

1331
01:32:53,932 --> 01:32:57,607
That is what we have been
working toward all this time.

1332
01:32:57,812 --> 01:33:00,406
And you are confusing the issue.

1333
01:33:01,452 --> 01:33:03,363
What about Sherman McCoy?

1334
01:33:03,852 --> 01:33:05,365
What about the truth?

1335
01:33:05,492 --> 01:33:06,925
Congratulations.

1336
01:33:07,732 --> 01:33:09,609
You're a reporter again.

1337
01:33:10,732 --> 01:33:13,292
Don't forget where your story came from.

1338
01:33:13,612 --> 01:33:16,331
That's right. You our boy, Peter.

1339
01:33:16,852 --> 01:33:19,685
You take care of us
and we'll take care of you.

1340
01:33:20,092 --> 01:33:25,041
I promise you that is going
to be a very profitable relationship...

1341
01:33:25,452 --> 01:33:27,363
...for all of us.

1342
01:33:39,772 --> 01:33:44,892
Annie, I know nothing can heal
the wound that you've suffered.

1343
01:33:46,412 --> 01:33:51,281
But $10,000,000 in damages
will make your grief more comfortable.

1344
01:33:59,372 --> 01:34:01,169
I could use a few things.

1345
01:34:01,772 --> 01:34:06,971
I feel that the presentation of my person
should be carefully designed.

1346
01:34:08,172 --> 01:34:11,050
I think I should have the right wardrobe.

1347
01:34:11,372 --> 01:34:15,684
So if Mr. Fox's limousine could pick me up
tomorrow morning...

1348
01:34:16,172 --> 01:34:18,003
...I could do some shopping.

1349
01:34:20,652 --> 01:34:21,926
Certainly.

1350
01:34:25,012 --> 01:34:26,491
<i>I printed the story they wanted.</i>

1351
01:34:28,852 --> 01:34:31,924
<i>If you work in a whorehouse,</i>
<i>there's only one thing to be.</i>

1352
01:34:32,012 --> 01:34:33,843
<i>The best whore in the house.</i>

1353
01:34:34,092 --> 01:34:38,131
<i>And I was beginning to see</i>
<i>even greater possibilities in my situation.</i>

1354
01:34:38,412 --> 01:34:41,131
They're going to sue the hospital.

1355
01:34:42,292 --> 01:34:43,930
All they want is money.

1356
01:34:45,132 --> 01:34:49,011
Can you imagine using a tragedy like this
for your own selfish motives?

1357
01:34:49,172 --> 01:34:50,651
It really is terrible.

1358
01:34:50,732 --> 01:34:52,245
Shut up, asshole!

1359
01:34:56,492 --> 01:35:00,326
What is happening to my campaign?
The People versus Sherman McCoy?

1360
01:35:01,452 --> 01:35:02,931
Where is my issue?

1361
01:35:04,012 --> 01:35:05,764
Where is my cause?

1362
01:35:07,132 --> 01:35:08,690
Where is my hope?

1363
01:35:12,012 --> 01:35:14,572
We've got to talk to this Ruskin woman.

1364
01:35:20,012 --> 01:35:24,005
You go to the press. Tell them we're going
to question the woman.

1365
01:35:24,212 --> 01:35:28,728
If she's the woman in the car,
she faces possible charges, etc., etc.

1366
01:35:32,492 --> 01:35:33,607
And you!

1367
01:35:34,772 --> 01:35:37,161
Mr. Wise-Guy-Know-It-All-Shitface!

1368
01:35:37,452 --> 01:35:40,330
You got us into this!
You're going to get us out.

1369
01:35:40,532 --> 01:35:42,443
Look at me when I talk to you!

1370
01:35:43,412 --> 01:35:47,928
Go to this broad.
Tell her she's in a whole lot of trouble.

1371
01:35:48,412 --> 01:35:52,849
But, if she's willing to cooperate,
if she'll say what we want her to say...

1372
01:35:53,012 --> 01:35:54,923
...we will grant her immunity.

1373
01:35:57,172 --> 01:35:59,083
What are you waiting for? Go!

1374
01:36:03,372 --> 01:36:04,487
Today?

1375
01:36:05,452 --> 01:36:07,841
Her husband's funeral is today.

1376
01:36:10,252 --> 01:36:13,927
I don't care if today is
her mother's bar mitzvah.

1377
01:36:14,412 --> 01:36:16,164
Go to her. Now!

1378
01:36:20,652 --> 01:36:23,530
I hear you did some creative wiring
in the building.

1379
01:36:24,692 --> 01:36:27,286
You bugged
Caroline Heftshank's apartment.

1380
01:36:27,412 --> 01:36:29,972
<i>In three minutes, I had what I needed.</i>

1381
01:36:30,252 --> 01:36:33,608
<i>It was more than a story.</i>
<i>I had the makings of a book.</i>

1382
01:36:33,812 --> 01:36:36,406
<i>A great book. A prize-winning effort.</i>

1383
01:36:36,892 --> 01:36:38,325
<i>All I needed was a finish.</i>

1384
01:36:38,412 --> 01:36:41,131
- Do you have the tape upstairs?
- I got it.

1385
01:36:41,612 --> 01:36:45,924
<i>I shipped off a present to McCoy's lawyer</i>
<i>and waited for the fireworks.</i>

1386
01:36:46,892 --> 01:36:49,360
<i>I don't feel terrifically sexy at the moment.</i>

1387
01:36:49,452 --> 01:36:52,649
<i>You know I'm a sucker</i>
<i>for a soft dick, Sherman.</i>

1388
01:36:52,812 --> 01:36:55,042
<i>You are incorrigible.</i>

1389
01:36:55,692 --> 01:36:58,490
That is me! That's Maria!
Where did you get this?

1390
01:36:58,572 --> 01:36:59,561
Listen!

1391
01:37:02,132 --> 01:37:06,250
<i>We could still go to the police.</i>
<i>We could get a talented lawyer.</i>

1392
01:37:06,412 --> 01:37:09,449
<i>And put our heads right</i>
<i>into the tiger's mouth?</i>

1393
01:37:09,652 --> 01:37:11,802
<i>I'm the one who was driving the car.</i>

1394
01:37:12,052 --> 01:37:15,203
<i>Shouldn't I be the one</i>
<i>to make that decision?</i>

1395
01:37:15,692 --> 01:37:18,252
<i>And I say no. I say no.</i>

1396
01:37:18,932 --> 01:37:22,242
The apartment was wired?
It was bugged all that time?

1397
01:37:22,412 --> 01:37:23,527
Why?

1398
01:37:23,692 --> 01:37:24,761
Who knows?

1399
01:37:24,892 --> 01:37:29,443
Whoever sent this tape is either a fan
of yours or not a fan of Maria's.

1400
01:37:29,812 --> 01:37:31,643
Then we have this as evidence!

1401
01:37:31,732 --> 01:37:34,485
This tape is illegal. Totally illegal.

1402
01:37:34,732 --> 01:37:37,371
The guy who did this could go to jail.

1403
01:37:37,612 --> 01:37:40,331
If this were your tape, it'd be legal.

1404
01:37:40,492 --> 01:37:41,527
But it's not.

1405
01:37:41,612 --> 01:37:43,523
If it were my tape?

1406
01:37:43,692 --> 01:37:46,081
If you recorded your own conversation...

1407
01:37:46,292 --> 01:37:48,044
...it would be okay.

1408
01:37:49,852 --> 01:37:52,571
But this tape can't be used as evidence
in a court of law.

1409
01:37:52,652 --> 01:37:54,165
Then what good is it?

1410
01:37:54,252 --> 01:37:56,561
- It gave me an idea.
- What kind of idea?

1411
01:37:56,852 --> 01:37:58,968
About what you wear to the funeral.

1412
01:37:59,372 --> 01:38:00,964
What funeral?

1413
01:38:40,652 --> 01:38:42,165
Please be seated.

1414
01:38:44,572 --> 01:38:48,201
In accordance with the wishes
of Mr. Ruskin...

1415
01:38:49,172 --> 01:38:53,450
...Manny Leerman will play a medley
of Arthur's favorite songs.

1416
01:39:00,652 --> 01:39:02,244
It's me. Sherman.

1417
01:39:16,652 --> 01:39:19,405
I need to talk to you. Can you come?

1418
01:39:28,012 --> 01:39:29,411
What are you doing here?

1419
01:39:29,492 --> 01:39:31,050
I had to talk to you.

1420
01:39:31,852 --> 01:39:36,323
Sherman, it seems like you've been doing
all your talking to the newspapers.

1421
01:39:36,532 --> 01:39:40,810
I had nothing to do with it.
We didn't want your name brought up.

1422
01:39:41,292 --> 01:39:42,247
I see.

1423
01:39:42,732 --> 01:39:44,802
Maria, you have to help me.

1424
01:39:45,932 --> 01:39:47,365
How can I help you?

1425
01:39:47,452 --> 01:39:51,764
This may sound strange,
but you could start by...

1426
01:39:52,652 --> 01:39:56,486
...telling the police
what really happened that night.

1427
01:39:56,692 --> 01:39:59,252
Sherman, you are the sweetest thing.

1428
01:39:59,732 --> 01:40:03,361
I'm not sure anybody knows
what really happened that night.

1429
01:40:03,692 --> 01:40:05,205
Not anymore.

1430
01:40:13,132 --> 01:40:16,966
There's something about funerals
that is so stimulating.

1431
01:40:17,212 --> 01:40:19,601
My panties have been wet all morning.

1432
01:40:22,972 --> 01:40:24,200
Maria, stop.

1433
01:40:24,412 --> 01:40:27,404
What's wrong with you?
Why are you all hunched over?

1434
01:40:27,692 --> 01:40:29,444
What's on your back?

1435
01:40:30,452 --> 01:40:32,363
This lump, this piece of metal.

1436
01:40:32,572 --> 01:40:35,769
- That's my belt buckle.
- You don't have a buckle in the back.

1437
01:40:35,852 --> 01:40:37,922
There's subterfuge afoot!

1438
01:40:38,252 --> 01:40:43,167
You're secreting something on your body!
I want to see what it is!

1439
01:40:44,212 --> 01:40:47,090
A hidden microphone? A wire!

1440
01:40:52,012 --> 01:40:54,401
You rotten, dishonest bastard!

1441
01:40:54,652 --> 01:40:57,530
I didn't want to do it!
You gave me no choice!

1442
01:41:02,612 --> 01:41:04,250
Go away, whoever you are!

1443
01:41:04,332 --> 01:41:08,962
I'm so sorry. I'm Jed Kramer,
of the district attorney's office.

1444
01:41:11,252 --> 01:41:13,163
District attorney's office.

1445
01:41:16,492 --> 01:41:18,448
My, my, my, Mr. McCoy.

1446
01:41:18,732 --> 01:41:21,804
I'd say your goose is just about home-fried.

1447
01:41:23,092 --> 01:41:26,243
I have protected you.
I have been a gentleman about this.

1448
01:41:26,332 --> 01:41:30,769
I've tried to keep your name out of the
papers. Now you must do the right thing!

1449
01:41:31,412 --> 01:41:33,926
Never. Never! Never!

1450
01:41:37,132 --> 01:41:40,363
I hope you die and hang
in the electric chair!

1451
01:41:43,052 --> 01:41:46,249
Mrs. Ruskin, I apologize for the intrusion...

1452
01:41:47,052 --> 01:41:48,201
He's gone!

1453
01:41:48,812 --> 01:41:51,565
I know. And I'm sorry for your loss.

1454
01:41:51,852 --> 01:41:53,763
He just ran out the back door!

1455
01:41:56,372 --> 01:41:58,124
- Who?
- Sherman McCoy!

1456
01:42:05,132 --> 01:42:08,841
I'm sorry if I alarmed you,
but he was acting very strange.

1457
01:42:10,092 --> 01:42:13,448
Where are my manners?
My name is Maria Ruskin.

1458
01:42:15,412 --> 01:42:16,845
I'm Kramer.

1459
01:42:17,292 --> 01:42:18,566
Jed Kramer.

1460
01:42:20,692 --> 01:42:23,252
I'm the assistant district attorney.

1461
01:42:23,692 --> 01:42:25,011
Bronx County.

1462
01:42:27,292 --> 01:42:28,361
I see.

1463
01:42:28,732 --> 01:42:31,405
What a handsome district attorney you are.

1464
01:42:33,052 --> 01:42:35,247
We have a lot to talk about.

1465
01:42:36,012 --> 01:42:38,572
Because if I'm going to testify...

1466
01:42:38,812 --> 01:42:41,690
...I need to know what I should
or should not say.

1467
01:42:41,812 --> 01:42:45,521
<i>You can start by telling the police</i>
<i>what really happened that night.</i>

1468
01:42:45,652 --> 01:42:47,927
<i>Sherman, you are the sweetest thing.</i>

1469
01:42:48,172 --> 01:42:51,084
<i>I'm not sure anybody knows</i>
<i>what really happened.</i>

1470
01:42:51,372 --> 01:42:52,805
<i>Not anymore.</i>

1471
01:43:19,212 --> 01:43:21,931
They weren't sure downstairs
if you were here.

1472
01:43:25,452 --> 01:43:27,522
I usually come up the back way now.

1473
01:43:28,012 --> 01:43:30,651
I see. May I?

1474
01:43:38,892 --> 01:43:40,803
It's all gone. Everything.

1475
01:43:42,452 --> 01:43:44,090
Judy's gone too?

1476
01:43:46,292 --> 01:43:47,930
She moves quickly.

1477
01:43:49,012 --> 01:43:51,287
She's got a good lawyer.

1478
01:43:53,932 --> 01:43:57,766
I'm not sure I ever really liked her,
your wife.

1479
01:44:00,692 --> 01:44:04,844
Or this apartment, for what you paid for it.

1480
01:44:05,332 --> 01:44:06,447
Or the furniture...

1481
01:44:06,532 --> 01:44:10,764
Or my car, or my job, or my clothes,
my life, my money!

1482
01:44:11,932 --> 01:44:15,402
Christ! You did not come
all the way here...

1483
01:44:16,332 --> 01:44:18,562
...on a fucking subway to tell me...

1484
01:44:18,892 --> 01:44:20,211
I am not...

1485
01:44:20,572 --> 01:44:24,531
...at this late date, going to get
the ethics and morality speech!

1486
01:44:24,812 --> 01:44:29,442
Not now! Not when I have to do what
I'm going to do in court tomorrow.

1487
01:44:29,932 --> 01:44:32,651
If you came to give me that...
Jesus Christ!

1488
01:44:38,332 --> 01:44:40,721
I don't know how to do this.

1489
01:44:42,652 --> 01:44:45,803
You didn't call. We wanted to help.

1490
01:44:48,692 --> 01:44:52,162
I came to say that we're here for you.

1491
01:44:52,452 --> 01:44:56,331
You're our son and we love you.

1492
01:44:58,292 --> 01:44:59,930
I don't mean "we."

1493
01:45:00,812 --> 01:45:02,131
I mean "I."

1494
01:45:03,572 --> 01:45:05,005
I love you.

1495
01:45:06,252 --> 01:45:07,526
That's all.

1496
01:45:10,252 --> 01:45:11,367
Please.

1497
01:45:27,892 --> 01:45:30,360
Have you thought about
what you want to do?

1498
01:45:33,812 --> 01:45:36,201
There's only one thing I can do.

1499
01:45:37,172 --> 01:45:39,811
I want the truth to come out
and burn every one of them.

1500
01:45:39,892 --> 01:45:41,883
There's only one way to do that.

1501
01:45:44,012 --> 01:45:45,286
Lie.

1502
01:45:49,652 --> 01:45:53,440
I have always been a great believer
in the truth.

1503
01:45:54,092 --> 01:45:56,652
I've lived my life as honestly as I can.

1504
01:45:58,012 --> 01:46:02,244
I believe in the truth as an essential
companion to a man of conscience.

1505
01:46:02,452 --> 01:46:06,730
A beacon in this vast and dark
wasteland that is our modern world.

1506
01:46:06,932 --> 01:46:08,160
And yet...

1507
01:46:09,772 --> 01:46:11,091
Yes?

1508
01:46:12,972 --> 01:46:16,965
In this case,
if the truth won't set you free...

1509
01:46:18,892 --> 01:46:20,211
...then lie.

1510
01:46:26,652 --> 01:46:32,488
Did this incident take place on the ramp
to the expressway, or on the avenue itself?

1511
01:46:33,372 --> 01:46:35,966
On the avenue. Right on the street.

1512
01:46:37,892 --> 01:46:43,649
Was there a barricade, or an obstruction
of any kind, that forced the car to stop?

1513
01:46:45,372 --> 01:46:47,966
No, there was nothing like that at all.

1514
01:46:51,932 --> 01:46:53,888
Just one last question.

1515
01:46:54,172 --> 01:46:57,403
Who was driving the car
when Henry Lamb was hit?

1516
01:47:02,012 --> 01:47:04,890
Sherman never let anyone drive his car.

1517
01:47:09,532 --> 01:47:12,729
So, Sherman McCoy was driving the car?

1518
01:47:17,532 --> 01:47:18,806
Yes.

1519
01:47:22,652 --> 01:47:27,123
Lock him up! Bang it shut!
Lock him up! Bang it shut!

1520
01:47:28,452 --> 01:47:30,647
Chill, everybody. Chill!

1521
01:47:31,772 --> 01:47:33,524
<i>And there it was.</i>

1522
01:47:34,052 --> 01:47:35,963
<i>The end of Sherman McCoy.</i>

1523
01:47:37,252 --> 01:47:39,607
<i>It wasn't the ending I was hoping for.</i>

1524
01:47:39,932 --> 01:47:43,288
<i>All my work, all my efforts,</i>
<i>down the tubes.</i>

1525
01:47:44,612 --> 01:47:47,172
<i>My hero was gone. Finished.</i>

1526
01:47:48,532 --> 01:47:52,002
<i>Maria might as well have put a gun</i>
<i>to his head and pulled the trigger.</i>

1527
01:47:52,092 --> 01:47:54,208
<i>She and everyone in this courtroom.</i>

1528
01:47:55,812 --> 01:47:58,201
<i>I saw a wave of triumph wash over them.</i>

1529
01:47:58,492 --> 01:48:02,121
<i>I could feel them rising like the tide</i>
<i>as Sherman sank before them.</i>

1530
01:48:03,292 --> 01:48:06,648
<i>The Master of the Universe was</i>
<i>going down for the third time.</i>

1531
01:48:07,172 --> 01:48:08,446
<i>It was all over.</i>

1532
01:48:08,892 --> 01:48:10,450
<i>There was no hope now.</i>

1533
01:48:10,852 --> 01:48:13,082
<i>The darkness closed in around him.</i>

1534
01:48:13,892 --> 01:48:16,281
<i>And then I noticed a peculiar thing.</i>

1535
01:48:18,492 --> 01:48:20,722
<i>Sherman was smiling.</i>

1536
01:48:21,572 --> 01:48:23,642
You people settle down!

1537
01:48:23,972 --> 01:48:26,361
I will have you all thrown out!

1538
01:48:27,812 --> 01:48:29,723
You are out of order!

1539
01:48:31,452 --> 01:48:33,408
Order in here! Order!

1540
01:48:37,532 --> 01:48:38,681
Order!

1541
01:48:43,652 --> 01:48:45,244
Go on, Mrs. Ruskin.

1542
01:48:46,212 --> 01:48:48,123
And I wanted...

1543
01:48:48,292 --> 01:48:52,285
...to report the incident,
but he wouldn't let me.

1544
01:48:52,732 --> 01:48:54,962
He said that he was driving...

1545
01:48:55,292 --> 01:48:58,170
...and that it was his decision to make.

1546
01:48:59,772 --> 01:49:03,651
And did that surprise you?

1547
01:49:03,972 --> 01:49:05,564
I was shocked.

1548
01:49:06,372 --> 01:49:11,241
There are certain qualities of virtue
that I admire in a human being.

1549
01:49:11,972 --> 01:49:13,530
Virtues that I hope...

1550
01:49:13,732 --> 01:49:15,324
...I possess myself.

1551
01:49:15,492 --> 01:49:17,164
<i>We have time for a quickie.</i>

1552
01:49:17,252 --> 01:49:18,526
<i>What do you say?</i>

1553
01:49:26,212 --> 01:49:28,407
<i>I don't feel terrifically sexy at the moment.</i>

1554
01:49:28,892 --> 01:49:31,770
<i>You know I'm a sucker</i>
<i>for a soft dick, Sherman.</i>

1555
01:49:35,332 --> 01:49:37,243
<i>You are incorrigible.</i>

1556
01:49:39,452 --> 01:49:43,286
<i>We could still go to the police.</i>
<i>We could get a talented lawyer.</i>

1557
01:49:43,492 --> 01:49:48,088
<i>And put our heads into the tiger's mouth?</i>
<i>I'm the one who was driving the car.</i>

1558
01:50:06,532 --> 01:50:08,568
Order in here, goddamn it! Order!

1559
01:50:13,372 --> 01:50:15,124
Approach the bench.

1560
01:50:17,732 --> 01:50:19,165
Now, gentlemen.

1561
01:50:23,812 --> 01:50:24,881
Damn it.

1562
01:50:26,172 --> 01:50:27,605
That can't be used.

1563
01:50:43,612 --> 01:50:45,523
- Whose tape is this?
- Mine.

1564
01:50:45,852 --> 01:50:46,887
Shut up!

1565
01:50:54,052 --> 01:50:56,930
I remind you that you are still under oath.

1566
01:51:01,532 --> 01:51:04,126
Did you record this conversation?

1567
01:51:05,532 --> 01:51:07,170
Yes, sir, I did.

1568
01:51:07,932 --> 01:51:10,127
I recorded the conversation on this tape.

1569
01:51:10,212 --> 01:51:12,043
My tape. This is my tape...

1570
01:51:12,252 --> 01:51:13,810
...of my conversation.

1571
01:51:14,852 --> 01:51:16,410
I recorded it.

1572
01:51:26,012 --> 01:51:27,411
Get out of my face.

1573
01:51:29,612 --> 01:51:30,522
All of you!

1574
01:51:32,972 --> 01:51:35,247
You can't let them get away with this!

1575
01:51:37,252 --> 01:51:38,526
Order!

1576
01:51:39,972 --> 01:51:41,564
Order in the court!

1577
01:51:44,772 --> 01:51:47,969
You insist on testing the will of this court?

1578
01:51:48,452 --> 01:51:50,522
Now shut up and sit down!

1579
01:52:03,452 --> 01:52:04,567
Very well.

1580
01:52:05,652 --> 01:52:08,530
In the case of
The People versus Sherman McCoy...

1581
01:52:12,732 --> 01:52:15,769
...based on the evidence contained
in this recording...

1582
01:52:18,372 --> 01:52:21,808
...I order the indictment dismissed
in the interest of justice.

1583
01:52:29,052 --> 01:52:31,168
That's not justice, you racist pig!

1584
01:52:32,612 --> 01:52:33,647
Racist?

1585
01:52:38,332 --> 01:52:40,892
You dare call me racist?

1586
01:52:45,212 --> 01:52:46,964
I say unto you...

1587
01:52:47,972 --> 01:52:51,169
...what does it matter
the color of a man's skin...

1588
01:52:51,452 --> 01:52:52,851
...if witnesses...

1589
01:52:52,932 --> 01:52:54,684
...perjure themselves?

1590
01:52:55,292 --> 01:52:56,691
If a prosecutor...

1591
01:52:57,252 --> 01:52:59,163
...enlists the perjurers?

1592
01:53:00,292 --> 01:53:02,203
When a district attorney...

1593
01:53:03,172 --> 01:53:05,128
...throws a man to the mob...

1594
01:53:05,372 --> 01:53:07,283
...for political gain?

1595
01:53:08,092 --> 01:53:10,162
When men of the cloth...

1596
01:53:12,772 --> 01:53:14,967
...men of God...

1597
01:53:16,412 --> 01:53:18,482
...take the prime cuts?

1598
01:53:24,932 --> 01:53:26,331
Is that justice?

1599
01:53:33,412 --> 01:53:35,004
I don't hear you.

1600
01:53:40,252 --> 01:53:42,812
I'll tell you what justice is.

1601
01:53:44,412 --> 01:53:45,845
Justice...

1602
01:53:46,852 --> 01:53:48,410
...is the law.

1603
01:53:50,052 --> 01:53:51,644
And the law...

1604
01:53:52,132 --> 01:53:54,521
...is man's feeble attempt...

1605
01:53:55,652 --> 01:53:59,167
...to set down the principles of decency.

1606
01:54:01,892 --> 01:54:03,291
Decency.

1607
01:54:04,572 --> 01:54:06,290
And decency is not a deal!

1608
01:54:08,132 --> 01:54:12,045
It isn't an angle, or a contract or a hustle.

1609
01:54:14,372 --> 01:54:15,964
Decency...

1610
01:54:22,652 --> 01:54:27,089
Decency is what
your grandmother taught you.

1611
01:54:31,132 --> 01:54:33,202
It's in your bones.

1612
01:54:37,572 --> 01:54:39,130
Now you go home.

1613
01:54:41,692 --> 01:54:46,720
Go home and be decent people.

1614
01:54:51,292 --> 01:54:53,044
Be decent.

1615
01:55:02,692 --> 01:55:05,081
Mr. McCoy, you're free to go.

1616
01:55:09,412 --> 01:55:11,084
I don't fucking believe this.

1617
01:55:13,452 --> 01:55:14,441
Shit!

1618
01:55:21,412 --> 01:55:23,528
<i>So we come to the end of our story.</i>

1619
01:55:24,772 --> 01:55:27,332
<i>That was the last I saw of Sherman McCoy.</i>

1620
01:55:27,612 --> 01:55:29,409
<i>The last anyone saw of him.</i>

1621
01:55:29,732 --> 01:55:30,926
<i>He was gone...</i>

1622
01:55:31,612 --> 01:55:34,968
<i>... in a blaze of glory. A hero for our times.</i>

1623
01:55:35,332 --> 01:55:38,404
<i>Or as close to a hero</i>
<i>as we're likely to get these days.</i>

1624
01:55:50,972 --> 01:55:54,647
And now, without further ado,
the man of the moment.

1625
01:55:55,332 --> 01:55:57,323
The winner of the Pulitzer Prize...

1626
01:55:57,412 --> 01:56:00,370
...the National Book Award
and every other prize you can win.

1627
01:56:00,452 --> 01:56:02,966
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Peter Fallow.

1628
01:56:25,572 --> 01:56:29,247
<i>Sherman, who started with so much,</i>
<i>lost everything.</i>

1629
01:56:29,732 --> 01:56:31,450
<i>But he gained his soul.</i>

1630
01:56:31,652 --> 01:56:34,212
<i>Whereas I, who started with so little...</i>

1631
01:56:34,692 --> 01:56:36,205
<i>... gained everything.</i>

1632
01:56:36,612 --> 01:56:40,287
<i>"But what does it profit a man</i>
<i>if he gains the world and loses..."</i>

1633
01:56:40,772 --> 01:56:41,887
<i>Ah, well.</i>

1634
01:56:42,492 --> 01:56:44,562
<i>There are compensations.</i>

1635
01:59:55,132 --> 01:59:58,124
