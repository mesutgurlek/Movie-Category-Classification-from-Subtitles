Monsieur le Comte is not here

A prior engagement, ma'am,

45
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,549
Monsieur le Comte was obliged
to pay his respects to Madame le Guillotine.

-Not for some time, Your Ladyship.
-Why not?

54
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,796
I'm also engaged to go to the West Indies

55
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:27,077
with Lord Craven's expedition
against the French, as chaplain.

56
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:32,188
-What has Craven offered you?
-I've hopes of a parish on my return.

57

How much is it worth?

58
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,228
Enough to marry on, in a modest way.

59

Mr Wisley, did you know

But, sir,

63

a ball is an indispensable blessing
to the juvenile part of the neighbourhood.

64
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,072
Everything agreeable in the way of talking

00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,758
Yes, a vastly fashionable pastime in London.

476
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,238
Beating a man to a pulp. What are you doing?

477
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,955
Mr Lefroy, stop!

478
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,594
TOM: Make way!

(GRUNTING)

480
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:42,032
-Stop!
-Let us see how you fare against me, sir.

481
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,228
Coming through.

482
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:52,552
Five shillings on the gent. Who will take it?
You, sir? That's the ticket.

483
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,794
Have that.

484
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:58,595
Thank you.

485
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,672
Go on, hit him!

486
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,355
Come on, Lefroy, hit him, man!

487
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,754
Tom, you must stop.

488
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,433
Come on, Lefroy!

489
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,633
Up, sir.

490
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,589
Tom!

491

-That's twice he's done that to me.
-You spend money like water.

495
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,349
I'm afraid it's damn low water with me.

496
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,750
-I'm afraid I'm short, sir.
-Take it.

497
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,952
How embarrassing.

498
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:47,669
Yeh!

499
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:51,755
Mr Lefroy? Mr Lefroy? Mr Lefroy?

500
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,196
Was I deficient in propriety?

501
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,791
Why did you do that?

502
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:07,717
Couldn't waste
all those expensive boxing lessons.

503
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:13,035
Forgive me if I suspect in you a sense of justice.

504

(CHUCKLING)

505
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:21,474
I am a lawyer. Justice plays no part in the law.

506
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,672
Is that what you believe?

507
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,999
I believe it. I must.

508
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,233
I beg your leave.

509
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:46,594
-Her heart is stirred.
-It's a summer squall.

510
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:52,876
Mr Lefroy will soon be gone.
And Mr Wisley will still be waiting, I hope.

511
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:56,637
-The man's a booby.
-Oh, he will grow out of that.

512
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:59,393
And she could fix him with very little trouble.

513
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:02,159
You could persuade her.

514
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:03,798
To sacrifice her happiness?

515
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:09,070
Jane should have not the man
who offers the best price, but the man she wants.

516
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:10,752
Oh, Mr Austen.

517
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:15,108
Must we have this conversation
day in and day out?

518
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:18,431
We'll end up in the gutter if we carry on like this.

519
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,390
MRS AUSTEN: Jenny! Mr Austen!

520
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:41,668
Where are you?

(DOORBELL DINGS)

522
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:08,070
So kind of you to return the call.

523
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:15,317
-Will you take a dish of tea, ma'am?
-Green tea?

524
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:19,431
-Brown, Your Ladyship.
-Then no.

525
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:27,076
Where is your youngest daughter?

526
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:30,955
She's visiting the poor, ma'am.

527
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:46,031
Jane? Jane!

528
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:54,833
At last. Lady Gresham and Mr Wisley
have come to call. Where have you been?

529
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,073
Ma'am. Sir.

530
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:04,037
Well, perhaps... Perhaps the young people
would like to take a walk?

531
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:07,829
I see there's a pretty little wilderness
at the side of the house.

532
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:10,719
Excuse me.

533
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:16,393
Jane?

534
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:21,995
-What is she doing?
-Writing.

535
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,831
Can anything be done about it?

536
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:34,277
Miss Austen, you may know

537
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:37,158
that I have known you

538
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:41,028
for some considerable time
during my visits to Steventon.

539
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:45,671
The garden is so affecting in this season.

540
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:47,754
Indeed.

541
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:53,189
-The impression you have given me has always...
-The flowers particularly.

542
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:56,992
What I'm trying to say is that I...

543
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:59,310
I have a respectable property of 2,000 a year

544
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:02,119
in addition to even greater expectations
as Lady Gresham's heir,

545
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:05,829
-to which it may be indelicate to refer.
-Oh, indelicate, yes.

546
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:09,754
It's yours. If we marry, all of it, yours.

547
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:14,873
Mr Wisley...

548
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:25,709
Your offer is most sincere, I can see,
and gentlemanlike, and it honours me, truly.

549
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:31,951
But for all you are, and all you offer, I...

550
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:35,115
Yes.

551

(CLEARS THROAT)

552
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:49,276
Sometimes affection is a shy flower
that takes time to blossom.

553
00:45:56,080 --> 00:46:00,710
Lying to tradesmen,
mending, scratching, scraping.

554
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:04,076
Endlessly, endlessly making do!

555
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:06,594
I understand
that our circumstances are difficult, ma'am.

556
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:10,673
-There is no money for you.
-Surely something could be done.

557
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:15,356
What we can put by must go to your brothers.
You will have nothing, unless you marry.

558
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:18,910
Well, then, I will have nothing. For I will not
marry without affection, like my mother!

559
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,117
And now I have to dig my own damn potatoes!

560
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:36,597
Would you rather be a poor old maid?
Ridiculous, despised, the butt of jokes?

561
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:41,397
The legitimate sport of any village lout
with a stone and an impudent tongue?

562
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:50,949
Affection is desirable.

563
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:55,914
Money is absolutely indispensable.

564
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:05,038
I could live by my...

-I could live by my...
-Pen?

567
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:17,320
Let's knock that notion on the head
once and for all.

568
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:18,674
What's this?

00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:22,317
Trouble amongst my women?

Come,

571
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:27,316
take hands and there's an end.

00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:30,790
-Where are you going? Miss!
-To feed the pigs, ma'am.

-A comfortable life.
-Father.

Consider.

576
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:00,274
This is likely to be your best offer.

Wisley?

578
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:05,477
It is true, so far he has not impressed...

-A booby.
-He should grow out of that.

I saw Queen Marie Antoinette
wear something the same at a ball once.

Am I making a show? I am, I know.

when we like them.

-Eliza, my brother is much younger than you.
-And poorer.

587
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:10,439
He knows that I care for him sincerely.

588
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:12,792
I know that he is handsome...

589
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:15,758
And the handsome young men must have
something to live on as well as the plain.

590
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:17,990
You encourage him to take you for money?

591
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:20,355
-Men do.
-That does not make it honourable.

592
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:22,192
Well, I'm a sensible woman.

593
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:25,628
I thank God I am not, by your description.

594
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:31,076
If you were, you might have ascertained
that your Irish friend has no money, not a penny

595
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:33,799
and could not be expected to marry without it.

596
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:36,630
Consider that at the ball tonight.

597
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:42,716
In any event, he'll be gone tomorrow back
to Bond Street where he can do no more harm.

598
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:33,112
Good evening, Miss Austen.

to be here at your aunt's ball.

TOM: You dance with passion.

605
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:57,909
No sensible woman would demonstrate passion
if the purpose were to attract a husband.

606
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:03,476
-As opposed to a lover?
-Hmm.

607
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:10,390
Rest easy, Mr Lefroy.

608
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:12,835
-I have no expectation on either account.
-I did not mean to offend or hurt...

Oh, no, no, of course not.
Excuse me, I'm just over warm.

Pardon me.

-Ah, Miss Austen.
-Excuse me.

612
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:10,716
HENRY: This is unbearable.
My father is pressing for an early ordination,

613
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:16,113
while my own inclination is to the scarlet of
a captaincy in His Majesty's regulars.

614
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:19,749
But I do not have the money to purchase one.

615
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:22,314
I do.

616
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:29,478
-Well, that, of course is impossible.
-Oh, Henry, do not disguise yourself, not to me.

617
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:37,189
The scarlet will suit you very well.

618
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:42,555
Miss Austen? There you are.

619
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:56,877
Miss Austen, I cannot believe I am obliged
to have this conversation.

620
00:56:58,240 --> 00:56:59,309
Your Ladyship?

621
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:04,793
Mr Wisley's mother,
my own dear sister, died young.

622
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:07,837
I have no children of my own.

623
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:12,395
I hope you never come to understand
the pain of that condition.

624
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:19,353
Let us simply say my nephew's wishes
are close to my heart,

625
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:23,315
however extraordinary they may be.

626
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:27,595
Well,

627
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:30,910
your health seems robust.

628
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:34,508
You have the usual accomplishments.

629
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:38,074
Your person is agreeable.

630
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:45,674
But when a young woman such as yourself
receives the addresses

631
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:51,073
from a gentleman such as my nephew,
it is her duty to accept at once.

632
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:53,678
But what do we find?

633
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:57,471
-Independent thought?
-Exactly.

634
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:04,039
My nephew, Miss Austen, condescends far indeed

635
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:08,871
in offering to the daughter of an obscure
and impecunious clergyman.

636
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:12,475
Impecunious? Your Ladyship is mistaken.

637
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:15,310
I am never mistaken.

638
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:20,034
Your father is in grave financial difficulties.

639
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:22,997
But all is not lost.

640
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:28,029
He has a daughter
upon whom fortune has smiled.

641
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:46,430
Mr Wisley is a good opportunity for Jane.

642
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:49,950
She should accept him at once.

643
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:54,520
Do not you think?

644
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:58,318
-Lucy, let us take some refreshments.
-What? Mother.

645
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:26,912
I have learned of Mr Wisley's marriage proposal.

646
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:29,913
My congratulations.

647
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:35,759
Is there an alternative for
a well-educated young woman of small fortune?

648
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,718
How can you have him?

649
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:41,876
Even with his thousands and his houses,

650
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:46,033
how can you, of all people,
dispose of yourself without affection?

651
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:52,274
How can I dispose of myself with it?

652
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:57,116
You are leaving tomorrow.

653
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:35,997
-Did I do that well?
-Very, very well.

654
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:41,232
I wanted, just once, to do it well.

655

(MEN CHATTERING)

656
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:50,317
I have no money, no property,

657
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:53,949
I am entirely dependent
upon that bizarre old lunatic, my uncle.

658
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:58,431
I cannot yet offer marriage.
But you must know what I feel.

659
01:00:59,560 --> 01:01:01,198
Jane, I'm yours.

660
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:06,556
Gah, I'm yours. I'm yours, heart and soul.

661
01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:10,636
Much good that is.

662
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:13,556
Let me decide that.

What we must.

-Welcome...
-Madame le Comtesse.

681
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:32,110
Madame le Comtesse. Seldom, too seldom,
my house receives the presence of nobility.

682
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:35,155
And, of course, its friends. Please.

683

Your stay is short. There's not a moment to lose.

My nephew has devised a plan
of metropolitan amusement.

685
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:49,713
Pleasure is, as you would say, Madame, his forte.

687
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:55,796
Which battle was it, Tom?

Villers-en-Cauchies.

Oh. Saving your presence, ma'am.

Be not afraid of abusing
the Jacobins on my account, Judge.

-They guillotined my husband.
-Oh, savages. Beasts.

-And his property?
-Confiscated.

01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:30,829
Do I detect you in irony?

700
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:40,034
It is my considered opinion
that irony is insult with a smiling face.

HENRY: (LAUGHING) Indeed.

702
01:03:43,480 --> 01:03:44,515
No.

703
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:47,595
No?

704
01:03:49,040 --> 01:03:53,158
No, irony is the bringing together
of contradictory truths

705
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:57,195
to make out of the contradiction a new truth
with a laugh or a smile,

706
01:03:57,280 --> 01:04:01,034
and I confess that a truth
must come with one or the other,

707
01:04:01,120 --> 01:04:05,671
or I account it as false and a denial
of the very nature of humanity itself.

708
01:04:09,040 --> 01:04:10,393
(CHUCKLES)

709
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:16,349
My cousin is a writer.

710
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:20,115
-Of what?
-Jane?

711
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:24,555
Novels.

712
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:28,954
A young woman of family?

713
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:34,832
Yes, uncle, and tomorrow
we go and visit another, Mrs Radcliffe.

714
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:39,230
She keeps herself to herself, almost a recluse,
but I know her husband through the law.

-Who?
-The authoress, Mrs Radcliffe.

716
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,594
-As writing is her profession.
-Her what?

717
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:48,274
£500, uncle, for the last novel,
The Mysteries of Udolpho.

718
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:50,920
-And £800, I believe, for her next.
-The Italian.

719
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,036
Above £1,000?

720
01:04:55,560 --> 01:04:58,791
The times, the times.

721
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:14,594
You live so quietly.

722
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:19,037
And yet your novels are filled
with romance, danger, terror.

723
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:22,951
Everything my life is not.

724
01:05:25,240 --> 01:05:26,355
Apparently.

725
01:05:27,120 --> 01:05:28,997
Of what do you wish to write?

726
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:32,913
Of the heart.

727
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:35,632
Do you know it?

728
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:38,159
Not all of it.

729
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:40,998
In time, you will.

730
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:46,072
But even if that fails,
that's what the imagination is for.

731
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:53,271
Your imagination has brought you independence.

732
01:05:55,040 --> 01:05:58,749
At a cost to myself and to my husband.

733
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:01,314
Poor William.

734
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:04,953
To have a wife who has a mind
is considered not quite proper.

735
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:08,999
To have a wife with a literary reputation
nothing short of scandalous.

736
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:16,116
But it must be possible?

01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:19,714
-To live as both wife and author?
-Oh.

01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:07,957
-The letter has done its work.
-Who sent it?

792
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:12,353
Lady Gresham?

793
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:15,239
Or her nephew.

794
01:12:23,560 --> 01:12:27,473
They think that they can do what they like
with us, but I will not accept this.

795
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:29,278
We have no choice.

796
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:31,833
Of course we do.

797
01:12:35,480 --> 01:12:36,549
I...

798
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:46,472
I depend entirely upon...

799
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:54,356
Upon your uncle.

800
01:12:55,160 --> 01:12:56,479
Mmm.

801
01:12:58,160 --> 01:12:59,912
And I depend on you.

802
01:13:06,280 --> 01:13:08,077
So what will you do?

803
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:12,399
What I must.

804
01:13:13,280 --> 01:13:17,558
I have a duty to my family, Jane.
I must think of them as well as...

805
01:13:17,640 --> 01:13:18,675
Tom...

806
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:25,312
Is that... Is that all you have to say to me?

807
01:13:41,320 --> 01:13:42,912
Goodbye, Mr Lefroy.

808
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:39,389
The sentence of this court is that you be taken
to the place whence you came

809
01:14:39,480 --> 01:14:42,756
and thence to a place of execution,

810
01:14:43,240 --> 01:14:47,791
and that you be there hanged by the neck
until you are dead.

811
01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:51,393
May the Lord have mercy on your soul.

812
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:01,509
Next.

813
01:15:13,720 --> 01:15:16,359
He has behaved so ill to you, Jane.

814
01:15:21,640 --> 01:15:24,598
Perhaps soon we can return home to Steventon.

815
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:28,791
Is there any news of Robert?

816
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:37,395
He has arrived in San Domingo at last.

817
01:15:37,480 --> 01:15:38,595
Good.

818
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:41,675
Good.

819
01:16:05,560 --> 01:16:07,869
Glass of wine with you, sir?

820
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:10,515
Yes.

821
01:16:11,080 --> 01:16:14,231
Yes, a toast from one member
of the profession to another.

822
01:17:26,760 --> 01:17:30,070
I'm sorry to have been so disobliging in the past.

823
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:37,153
Mr Wisley?

824
01:17:42,680 --> 01:17:46,116
So, the infamous Mrs Radcliffe.

825
01:17:46,600 --> 01:17:49,273
Was she really as gothic as her novels?

826
01:17:52,120 --> 01:17:54,236
Not in externals,

827
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:57,153
but her inner landscape is quite picturesque,
I suspect.

828
01:17:57,240 --> 01:17:58,719
True of us all.

829
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:57,828
(WHISPERING) There's a message
for Reverend Austen.

830
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:05,595
-(WHISPERING) Message for Reverend Austen.
-Thank you.

831
01:19:30,240 --> 01:19:31,514
ELIZA: Uncle?

832
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:48,553
What is it?

833
01:19:53,800 --> 01:19:56,633
(SOBBING)

834
01:20:22,760 --> 01:20:25,274
(GASPING)

835
01:20:47,320 --> 01:20:50,835
It seemed he died very soon
after landing in San Domingo.

836
01:20:51,120 --> 01:20:53,270
My God, he was hardly there.

837
01:20:54,200 --> 01:20:56,031
What was the disease?

838
01:20:57,280 --> 01:21:00,909
Yellow fever. Lord Craven, he wrote.

839
01:21:01,320 --> 01:21:04,471
He said that if he had known
he was engaged to be married,

840
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:06,755
he would never have taken him.

841
01:21:13,560 --> 01:21:16,199
Jane, there's something else.

842
01:21:17,880 --> 01:21:20,110
Mr Lefroy, Tom.

843
01:21:22,160 --> 01:21:23,195
What?

844
01:21:23,960 --> 01:21:26,838
I would keep this from you if I could.

845
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,833
He's here visiting Mrs Lefroy and I...

846
01:21:29,960 --> 01:21:31,552
He is engaged.

847
01:21:41,640 --> 01:21:42,789
So soon?

848
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:16,234
A letter?

849
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:19,595
No.

850
01:22:20,120 --> 01:22:22,634
It's something I began in London.

851
01:22:26,840 --> 01:22:29,752
It is the tale of a young woman.

852
01:22:30,440 --> 01:22:32,032
Two young women.

853
01:22:34,280 --> 01:22:36,236
Better than their circumstances.

854
01:22:36,640 --> 01:22:38,073
So many are.

855
01:22:38,160 --> 01:22:40,993
And two young gentlemen who receive

856
01:22:41,480 --> 01:22:44,631
much better than their deserts
as so very many do.

857
01:22:46,680 --> 01:22:47,874
Mmm.

858
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:53,798
How does the story begin?

859
01:22:54,360 --> 01:22:55,793
-Badly.
-And then?

860
01:22:55,880 --> 01:22:57,472
It gets worse.

861
01:22:59,160 --> 01:23:00,991
With, I hope, some humour.

862
01:23:06,640 --> 01:23:08,198
How does it end?

863
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,389
They both make triumphant, happy endings.

864
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:20,152
Brilliant marriages?

865
01:23:21,240 --> 01:23:23,470
Incandescent marriages

866
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:26,678
to very rich men.

867
01:23:39,160 --> 01:23:42,516
You asked me a question.

868
01:23:43,480 --> 01:23:47,951
I am ready to give you an answer.
But there is one matter to be settled.

869
01:23:51,560 --> 01:23:53,710
I cannot make you out, Mr Wisley.

870
01:23:55,680 --> 01:23:57,318
At times, you are

871
01:23:58,240 --> 01:24:01,232
the most gentlemanlike man I know
and yet you would...

872
01:24:01,320 --> 01:24:03,959
"Yet". What a sad word.

873
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:09,630
And yet, you write yourself
most tellingly to great effect.

874
01:24:11,040 --> 01:24:14,237
-I'm speaking, of course, of your letter.
-What letter?

875
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:17,437
Was your aunt the correspondent on your behalf?

876
01:24:19,400 --> 01:24:20,799
What matter?

877
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:24,115
One way or another,
passion makes fools of us all.

878
01:24:24,200 --> 01:24:26,509
I hope, in time,
passion may regain your better opinion.

879
01:24:26,600 --> 01:24:28,477
The emotion is absurd.

880
01:24:29,400 --> 01:24:32,153
When you consider
the sex to whom it is often directed,

881
01:24:32,240 --> 01:24:34,515
indistinguishable from folly.

882
01:24:36,440 --> 01:24:40,399
I thank you for the honour of your proposal.
I accept. Good day.

883
01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:07,799
George, George.

884
01:25:08,440 --> 01:25:11,830
Mr Wisley is... He's an honourable man.

885
01:25:11,920 --> 01:25:13,990
You'll always have a place with me.

886
01:25:14,480 --> 01:25:15,708
(GRUNTS)

887
01:25:19,400 --> 01:25:20,719
Miss Austen.

888
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:24,359
Mr Lefroy.

889
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:34,115
Sir.

890
01:25:38,240 --> 01:25:41,550
I believe I must congratulate you, Mr Lefroy.

891
01:25:43,200 --> 01:25:47,034
And you've come to visit an old friend
at such a time. How considerate.

892
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:56,317
I have come

893
01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:59,198
to offer an explanation, belatedly,

894
01:26:00,280 --> 01:26:04,068
for my conduct. I cannot think how to describe it.

895
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:06,628
Tell me about your lady, Mr Lefroy.

896
01:26:07,880 --> 01:26:09,871
From where does she come?

897
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:13,910
She's from County Wexford.

898
01:26:14,280 --> 01:26:17,158
Your own country. Excellent.

899
01:26:19,480 --> 01:26:24,679
What was it that won her?
Your manner, smiles and pleasing address?

900
01:26:30,360 --> 01:26:33,193
No, no, not at all.

901
01:26:33,360 --> 01:26:39,629
No, had I really experienced that emotion,
I should, at present, detest the very sight of him.

902
01:26:39,720 --> 01:26:41,517
And you are mistaken.

903
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:45,912
I'm even impartial towards
the gloriously endowed Miss Wexford...

904
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:47,592
I cannot do this.

905
01:26:57,160 --> 01:26:59,276
And so you would marry Wisley?

906
01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:06,232
(WHISPERS) Please?

907
01:27:09,280 --> 01:27:13,159
If there is a shred of truth
or justice inside of you,

908
01:27:13,240 --> 01:27:15,356
-you cannot marry him.
-Oh no, Mr Lefroy.

909
01:27:15,440 --> 01:27:18,273
Justice, by your own admission,
you know little of, truth even less.

910
01:27:18,360 --> 01:27:22,751
Jane, I have tried.
I have tried and I cannot live this lie.

911
01:27:23,720 --> 01:27:24,948
Can you?

912
01:27:26,040 --> 01:27:28,315
Jane, can you?

913
01:27:32,240 --> 01:27:35,710
What value will there be in life
if we are not together?

914
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:44,677
Run away with me.

915
01:27:47,120 --> 01:27:48,758
An elopement?

916
01:27:49,680 --> 01:27:51,910
That is exactly what I propose.

917
01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:57,397
We'll post to London,
by Friday be in Scotland, and man and wife.

918
01:27:59,800 --> 01:28:02,155
-Leave everything?
-Everything.

919
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,389
It is the only way we can be together.

920
01:28:24,600 --> 01:28:26,556
You'll lose everything.

921
01:28:27,200 --> 01:28:31,478
Family, place. For what?

922
01:28:31,880 --> 01:28:34,519
A lifetime of drudgery on a pittance?

923
01:28:35,200 --> 01:28:38,431
A child every year
and no means to lighten the load?

924
01:28:38,720 --> 01:28:41,632
-How will you write, Jane?
-I do not know.

925
01:28:42,040 --> 01:28:44,838
But happiness is within my grasp
and I cannot help myself.

926
01:28:44,920 --> 01:28:46,956
There is no sense in this.

927
01:28:51,120 --> 01:28:55,432
If you could have your Robert back, even like this,

928
01:28:56,480 --> 01:28:58,072
would you do it?

-Not yet.

01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:52,480
Right, all together now then, sirs, please?

Come on.

MRS LEFROY: "Dear Tom.

of the money you sent. "

Well done. Thank you, sirs.

967
01:32:37,800 --> 01:32:42,078
All right, ladies and gentlemen, back on
the coach as soon as you can, thank you.

968
01:32:51,480 --> 01:32:52,959
We are ready.

969
01:32:59,080 --> 01:33:01,230
-Worried?
-No.

970
01:33:02,720 --> 01:33:06,508
-Is it the loss of your reputation?
-No.

971
01:33:08,520 --> 01:33:09,919
The loss of yours.

972
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:13,754
-I do not...
-Please, sir, come along, the coach is departing.

973
01:33:13,840 --> 01:33:14,989
Come.

974
01:33:49,720 --> 01:33:52,188
COACHMAN: Changing horses.
Twenty minutes only.

975

House of office at the back of the inn.
All down, quick as you like.

976
01:34:17,960 --> 01:34:21,475
How many brothers and sisters
do you have in Limerick, Tom?

977
01:34:21,560 --> 01:34:23,835
Enough. Why?

978
01:34:27,080 --> 01:34:29,719
What are the names of your brothers and sisters?

979
01:34:29,800 --> 01:34:31,153
They...

980
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:36,670
On whom do they depend?

981
01:34:40,600 --> 01:34:41,715
(SIGHS)

982
01:34:41,800 --> 01:34:43,756
Your reputation is destroyed.

983
01:34:46,360 --> 01:34:49,670
Your profligacy is a beautiful sham.

984
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:04,231
-I can earn money.
-It will not be enough.

985
01:35:06,200 --> 01:35:07,679
I will rise.

986
01:35:08,480 --> 01:35:12,075
With a High Court Judge as your enemy?
And a penniless wife?

987
01:35:13,240 --> 01:35:16,118
God knows how many mouths depending on you?

988
01:35:17,440 --> 01:35:21,911
My sweet, sweet friend,
you will sink, and we will all sink with you.

989
01:35:22,120 --> 01:35:24,190
-I will...
-COACHMAN: Hampshire Flyer.

990
01:35:24,280 --> 01:35:26,999
Hampshire Flyer's leaving in five minutes.

991
01:35:31,240 --> 01:35:34,550
No! No, Jane.

992
01:35:35,560 --> 01:35:37,073
I will never give you up.

993
01:35:37,160 --> 01:35:41,039
-Tom...
-Don't speak or think.

994
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:45,392
Just love me. Do you love me?

995
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:48,749
Yes.

996
01:35:50,520 --> 01:35:54,195
But if our love destroys your family,
it will destroy itself.

997
01:35:54,480 --> 01:35:55,833
-No.
-Yes.

998
01:35:56,680 --> 01:36:00,753
In a long, slow degradation
of guilt and regret and blame.

999
01:36:00,840 --> 01:36:02,319
That is nonsense.

1000
01:36:05,440 --> 01:36:06,634
Truth.

1001
01:36:07,800 --> 01:36:09,472
Made from contradiction.

1002
01:36:12,920 --> 01:36:15,195
But it must come with a smile.

1003
01:36:16,240 --> 01:36:20,677
Or else I shall count it as false
and we shall have had no love at all.

1004
01:36:25,360 --> 01:36:27,476
Please.

1005
01:36:34,240 --> 01:36:35,468
Goodbye.

1006
01:36:51,800 --> 01:36:54,792
Typical bloody runaway. "Will I, won't I? "

1007
01:37:14,040 --> 01:37:16,315
Miss. Miss.

1008
01:37:20,960 --> 01:37:22,552
All right, off you go.

1009
01:38:23,400 --> 01:38:25,960
(CLOCK TICKING)

1010
01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:41,399
Hello?

1011
01:38:45,520 --> 01:38:49,308
-Where is everyone?
-Looking for you, Miss. Looking everywhere.

1012
01:38:50,320 --> 01:38:52,311
-Thank you, Jenny.
-Mr Warren.

1013
01:38:56,360 --> 01:38:59,875
Your family tried to keep the matter
from the servants, but...

1014
01:39:01,480 --> 01:39:04,995
Where is that blackguard Lefroy?
My God, if Henry finds him, he'll kill him.

1015
01:39:05,080 --> 01:39:06,672
He won't find him.

1016
01:39:07,640 --> 01:39:09,756
If he does, he won't kill him.

1017
01:39:11,160 --> 01:39:12,752
There's no need.

1018
01:39:14,800 --> 01:39:17,951
What happened?

1019
01:39:20,120 --> 01:39:21,712
Nothing happened.

1020
01:39:23,760 --> 01:39:26,797
I see. I see.

1021
01:39:36,600 --> 01:39:37,794
Jane,

1022
01:39:40,600 --> 01:39:43,831
I may have less personal charm than Lefroy.

1023
01:39:44,960 --> 01:39:50,990
Superficial charm to some eyes.
To others, it is mere affectation, but I...

1024
01:39:51,080 --> 01:39:53,389
-I have no hopes.
-Hopes?

1025
01:39:55,360 --> 01:39:58,079
You cannot begin to imagine.

1026
01:39:58,440 --> 01:40:01,557
Thank you for the great honour of your offer,

1027
01:40:02,800 --> 01:40:05,314
but are there no other women in Hampshire?

1028
01:40:25,360 --> 01:40:27,635
It was you who wrote the judge.

1029
01:40:32,200 --> 01:40:35,510
You must consider
how much I have always loved you.

1030
01:40:56,160 --> 01:40:58,355
(PLAYING SLOW SONG ON PIANO)

1031
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:23,319
Well?

1032
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:29,831
You came back to us.

1033
01:41:56,920 --> 01:41:58,148
Leave it.

1034
01:42:01,840 --> 01:42:05,753
Mr Austen, I must inform you
that I shall not attend service today.

1035
01:42:05,840 --> 01:42:08,513
-Not in the presence of this young woman.
-Indeed...

1036
01:42:08,600 --> 01:42:10,636
-If I must speak plainly...
-Aunt.

1037
01:42:10,720 --> 01:42:14,679
I believe your youngest daughter
has been on a journey.

1038
01:42:14,760 --> 01:42:19,276
-Her Ladyship considers travel a crime?
-Unsanctioned travel.

1039
01:42:19,360 --> 01:42:23,319
Furthermore, be aware that my nephew
has withdrawn his addresses

1040
01:42:23,400 --> 01:42:27,188
to someone without family, fortune, importance

1041
01:42:28,040 --> 01:42:31,316
and fatally tainted by suspicion.

1042
01:42:31,400 --> 01:42:36,349
-Oh, she has family, madam.
-REVEREND AUSTEN: Indeed she has.

1043
01:42:37,600 --> 01:42:41,798
Importance may depend upon other matters
than Your Ladyship can conceive.

1044
01:42:42,880 --> 01:42:46,395
As to fortune, a young woman
might depend upon herself.

1045
01:42:48,720 --> 01:42:51,109
An interesting notion, Miss Austen.

1046
01:42:52,560 --> 01:42:53,709
(EXCLAIMING)

1047
01:42:58,040 --> 01:43:01,919
Oblige me a walk along the river
to enlarge upon the topic.

1048
01:43:04,120 --> 01:43:05,348
Wisley?

1049
01:43:12,800 --> 01:43:17,555
I am sorry if my conduct
has disappointed you, Mr Wisley.

1050
01:43:18,720 --> 01:43:22,554
It seems you cannot bring yourself
to marry without affection.

1051
01:43:22,640 --> 01:43:24,278
Or even with it.

1052
01:43:25,760 --> 01:43:29,719
I respect you for that
and share your opinion. Neither can I.

1053
01:43:32,320 --> 01:43:35,278
I'd always hoped to win your love in time,

1054
01:43:35,360 --> 01:43:38,989
but I am vain enough to want to be loved
for myself rather than my money.

1055
01:43:39,080 --> 01:43:40,991
Do we part as friends?

1056
01:43:42,920 --> 01:43:44,273
We do.

1057
01:43:47,400 --> 01:43:49,914
-So, you will live...
-By my pen. Yes.

1058
01:43:54,200 --> 01:43:57,158
Will all your stories have happy endings?

1059
01:43:57,840 --> 01:43:59,671
My characters will have,

1060
01:44:00,280 --> 01:44:02,475
after a little bit of trouble,

1061
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:05,910
all that they desire.

1062
01:44:08,200 --> 01:44:10,998
The good do not always come to good ends.

1063
01:44:13,400 --> 01:44:16,073
It is a truth universally acknowledged.

1064

Is it Miss Austen? The Miss Austen?

1077
01:46:42,200 --> 01:46:45,510
No, Madam. That courtesy,
according to the customs of precedence,

1078
01:46:45,600 --> 01:46:47,511
belongs to my elder sister.

Miss Jane Austen,
the authoress of Pride and Prejudice?

1080

My sister wishes to remain anonymous,
but your kind regard is much appreciated.

1081
01:46:55,360 --> 01:46:57,157
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1082
01:47:29,640 --> 01:47:31,437
Please, come through.

1083
01:47:32,560 --> 01:47:33,959
I shall never forgive Henry for this.

Yes, you will.
We always forgive him for everything.

your most avid of admirers,
my daughter, Miss Lefroy.

1091

Miss Austen, what a pleasure to meet you.

01:48:15,320 --> 01:48:17,629
Will you read for us this evening?

Ah, well, you see, my sister never reads.

supposed to remain anonymous?

-But...
-Jane.

1096

I will make an exception

1097
01:48:35,200 --> 01:48:37,270
if my new friend wishes it.

1098

Come, sit by me.
