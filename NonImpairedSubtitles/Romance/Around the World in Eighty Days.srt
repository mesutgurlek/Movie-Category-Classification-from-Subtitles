1
00:00:09,125 --> 00:00:10,888
Jules Verne wrote many books.

2
00:00:11,561 --> 00:00:15,258
He was able to transfer
his soaring imagination to print.

3
00:00:16,232 --> 00:00:17,824
His predictions were bold.

4
00:00:18,234 --> 00:00:21,431
What he wrote was regarded
as fantastic fiction...

5
00:00:22,038 --> 00:00:24,029
but much of it has become fact.

6
00:00:25,008 --> 00:00:29,206
Flying machines,
submarines, television, rockets.

7
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:33,344
But not even his imagination
could shrink the earth...

8
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,179
to the point it has now reached.

9
00:00:35,385 --> 00:00:38,411
He wrote a book called
<i>From the Earth to the Moon</i>.

10
00:00:38,722 --> 00:00:41,919
And in Paris,
that authentic genius Georges Méliès...

11
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:44,726
turned it into a movie, 35 millimeter...

12
00:00:45,161 --> 00:00:46,924
just as you're looking at it now.

13
00:00:47,197 --> 00:00:49,256
It was, of course, fantasy.

14
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,898
But as of now,
no one has yet gone to the moon...

15
00:00:53,103 --> 00:00:55,094
to see whether Méliès was right.

16
00:00:55,438 --> 00:00:59,101
Here is the actual film
as Méliès' camera recorded it...

17
00:00:59,275 --> 00:01:00,970
at the turn of the century.

18
00:01:09,586 --> 00:01:12,350
<i>I suppose that since man</i>
<i>began to walk upright...</i>

19
00:01:12,589 --> 00:01:15,217
<i>he has been interested in space and speed.</i>

20
00:01:16,059 --> 00:01:20,189
<i>He has wondered increasingly</i>
<i>about the planets he sees in the sky.</i>

21
00:01:21,397 --> 00:01:25,834
<i>The stretching fingertips of science</i>
<i>have moved him higher and faster...</i>

22
00:01:25,969 --> 00:01:28,096
<i>than man has ever moved before.</i>

23
00:01:28,772 --> 00:01:32,230
<i>One of Jules Verne's characters,</i>
<i>a fanatic and a dreamer...</i>

24
00:01:32,475 --> 00:01:35,239
<i>argues for the construction</i>
<i>of a rocket to the moon.</i>

25
00:01:42,986 --> 00:01:46,717
<i>After reasoned discourse,</i>
<i>the venture is launched.</i>

26
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:56,262
<i>This is the first photographic dissolve.</i>

27
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:06,174
<i>This is a do-it-yourself rocket.</i>

28
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:19,673
<i>Rockets have changed.</i>
<i>Photography has changed.</i>

29
00:03:19,849 --> 00:03:21,578
<i>Costumes have changed.</i>

30
00:03:22,018 --> 00:03:26,580
<i>But some things remain unchanged,</i>
<i>even in Verne and Méliès'imagination.</i>

31
00:04:27,984 --> 00:04:30,646
<i>Jules Verne's rocket returns to the earth...</i>

32
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:34,586
<i>a minor planet,</i>
<i>where fiction lags behind fact.</i>

33
00:04:35,925 --> 00:04:37,688
<i>Ten, nine...</i>

34
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:42,054
<i>eight, seven, six, five...</i>

35
00:04:42,298 --> 00:04:47,133
<i>four, three, two, one. Fire!</i>

36
00:05:09,525 --> 00:05:11,925
<i>There is, in this power of destruction...</i>

37
00:05:12,128 --> 00:05:13,891
<i>also the promise of hope.</i>

38
00:05:14,597 --> 00:05:18,055
<i>A world of unlimited power</i>
<i>and limitless hope.</i>

39
00:05:18,468 --> 00:05:21,995
<i>Man has devised a method</i>
<i>of destroying most of humanity...</i>

40
00:05:22,438 --> 00:05:26,670
<i>or of lifting it up to high plateaus</i>
<i>of prosperity and progress...</i>

41
00:05:27,176 --> 00:05:29,770
<i>never dreamed of</i>
<i>by the boldest dreamers.</i>

42
00:05:30,446 --> 00:05:34,109
<i>You are now looking</i>
<i>at the receding shape of this planet Earth.</i>

43
00:05:39,789 --> 00:05:42,917
<i>This is how the earth looks</i>
<i>from a camera in the rocket.</i>

44
00:05:44,394 --> 00:05:48,956
<i>Jules Verne wrote a book</i>
<i>about going around the world in 80 days.</i>

45
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:52,833
<i>He even predicted</i>
<i>it could be done in 80 hours.</i>

46
00:05:53,669 --> 00:05:56,729
<i>Today it can be done</i>
<i>in less than half that time.</i>

47
00:05:57,206 --> 00:05:59,401
<i>But each journey must have an end.</i>

48
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:03,810
<i>Speed is good</i>
<i>only when wisdom leads the way.</i>

49
00:06:04,347 --> 00:06:05,780
<i>The end of this journey...</i>

50
00:06:06,015 --> 00:06:10,247
<i>whether to the high horizons of hope</i>
<i>or the depths of destruction...</i>

51
00:06:10,753 --> 00:06:13,278
will be determined
by the collective wisdom...

52
00:06:13,556 --> 00:06:16,354
of the people who live
on this shrinking planet.

53
00:06:18,661 --> 00:06:23,428
There was a time not so long ago
when learned men thought that was flat.

54
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:28,058
<i>Around The World In 80 Days</i>
is the Jules Verne classic.

55
00:06:29,338 --> 00:06:32,068
And the world was already shrinking
when it was written.

56
00:06:32,241 --> 00:06:34,072
And that was in 1872.

57
00:07:27,997 --> 00:07:31,364
Get your morning paper here.
All about the bank robbery here.

58
00:07:32,768 --> 00:07:33,860
Paper, sir?

59
00:07:51,621 --> 00:07:54,089
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning, Thorndyke.

60
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:01,792
- Hinshaw.
- Yes, sir.

61
00:08:01,931 --> 00:08:04,991
Someone's been tampering
with my <i>Telegraph</i>. The pages are crushed.

62
00:08:05,535 --> 00:08:08,663
One of the members borrowed it
to read about the robbery.

63
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:10,663
You mean it's been used?

64
00:08:11,274 --> 00:08:14,004
- Kindly remove it and send for a fresh one.
- At once, sir.

65
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:17,771
I'm a patient man, Hinshaw,
but don't trespass on my good feelings.

66
00:08:23,186 --> 00:08:25,950
Pilbeam! Did you hear that?

67
00:08:26,355 --> 00:08:29,483
- Some fellow stole that chap's paper.
- The devil you say!

68
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:30,616
Word of honor.

69
00:08:30,726 --> 00:08:33,820
First time it's happened here,
to my knowledge, in 45 years.

70
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,420
The club's going to the dogs.

71
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:38,590
Next thing you know,
the members will be talking to each other!

72
00:08:38,701 --> 00:08:41,135
- Yes, it's the thin end of the wedge.
- Oh, dog!

73
00:08:48,411 --> 00:08:50,402
- Ice, my lord?
- Ice?

74
00:08:51,013 --> 00:08:54,073
Certainly not.
What do I look like, a polar bear?

75
00:08:54,217 --> 00:08:58,449
Sorry, sir. Several of the members use it
now and then.

76
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:02,519
Learned it from some Yankee, I dare say.
Those redskins over there drink anything.

77
00:09:02,692 --> 00:09:05,126
A dangerous custom,
as I've always thought, sir.

78
00:09:05,394 --> 00:09:08,090
A man might catch
a nasty chill on his liver.

79
00:09:09,198 --> 00:09:10,495
Or break a tooth.

80
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:13,134
Remind me to speak
to the House committee about it.

81
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:16,032
No, by Gad! I'll write a letter to <i>The Times</i>.

82
00:09:23,079 --> 00:09:25,570
- I say, Hinshaw.
- Yes, Mr. Mockridge?

83
00:09:29,552 --> 00:09:33,113
Must we have that confounded animal
around here, stamping its feet?

84
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:44,432
- Mind the horses!
- That bloke is barmy!

85
00:10:05,554 --> 00:10:06,851
There's a sight!

86
00:10:20,636 --> 00:10:23,696
Move over!
Move that confounded contraption!

87
00:11:58,267 --> 00:12:00,462
When I placed you with Mr. Fogg
a fortnight ago...

88
00:12:00,603 --> 00:12:02,127
I warned you that he was an eccentric.

89
00:12:02,338 --> 00:12:05,364
An eccentric, Mr. Hesketh-Baggott?
The man's a tyrant.

90
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:08,307
A cold-hearted, implacable fiend.

91
00:12:08,511 --> 00:12:12,709
Must I remind you that you are
speaking of a member of the Reform Club?

92
00:12:12,848 --> 00:12:16,079
I don't care if he's member of the
Worshipful Company of Fishmongers.

93
00:12:16,218 --> 00:12:17,276
The man's mad!

94
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:21,012
Actually, excessive sanity
is not a necessary qualification...

95
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:22,919
for that particular institution.

96
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:25,184
Believe me, sir, he is not human.

97
00:12:25,294 --> 00:12:27,854
Do you know how many valets
he's had in six months?

98
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:31,056
Certainly I do.
I've supplied him with five of them myself.

99
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:34,864
And are you aware that he tortured them
with a refinement of cruelty...

100
00:12:35,037 --> 00:12:39,098
which would have put Torquemada and
the entire Spanish Inquisition to shame!

101
00:12:39,241 --> 00:12:43,405
He's as cold and methodical as those
two watches he carries about with him.

102
00:12:46,115 --> 00:12:48,777
You are abandoning yourself to rhetoric.

103
00:12:49,118 --> 00:12:52,554
Remember, you're being rigorously trained
as a gentleman's gentleman.

104
00:12:52,721 --> 00:12:54,848
A gentleman's gentleman is one thing, sir.

105
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:57,151
A whimpering, cringing...

106
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:00,321
slave is another.

107
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:05,667
You are allowing
your native imperturbability...

108
00:13:05,835 --> 00:13:09,202
to be swept away
by a spate of mounting hysteria.

109
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:12,435
- You really must calm down.
- I can't help it, sir.

110
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,366
If you knew how ardently
I have worked for Mr. Fogg...

111
00:13:15,578 --> 00:13:19,070
how enthusiastically I have endeavored
to cater to his every whim.

112
00:13:19,748 --> 00:13:24,048
His bath water had to be exactly
one foot, three and one-quarter inches.

113
00:13:24,353 --> 00:13:25,650
No less, no more.

114
00:13:26,589 --> 00:13:30,025
His morning toast had to be
83 degrees Fahrenheit.

115
00:13:30,326 --> 00:13:32,692
- No more, no less.
- Extraordinary.

116
00:13:34,129 --> 00:13:36,563
How does one take
the temperature of toast?

117
00:13:38,801 --> 00:13:40,029
Incidentally...

118
00:13:41,437 --> 00:13:45,066
have you found out
anything definite about him?

119
00:13:45,841 --> 00:13:47,502
Who he is, what he does?

120
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:50,871
- Not the faintest indication, sir. Have you?
- Alas, no.

121
00:13:51,814 --> 00:13:54,248
All I have discovered is entirely negative.

122
00:13:54,884 --> 00:13:57,444
He is not a professional man,
and he isn't in trade.

123
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,917
He has no family connections
or background worth mentioning.

124
00:14:01,056 --> 00:14:05,493
He doesn't go in
for hunting, or fishing, or wenching.

125
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:10,527
Cannot imagine how he ever got
into the Reform Club!

126
00:14:11,133 --> 00:14:15,229
Perhaps your uncle the Bishop
might inquire for you.

127
00:14:15,371 --> 00:14:19,171
- He is a member, is he not?
- One of the most distinguished, Foster.

128
00:14:20,209 --> 00:14:22,871
We are a very ancient family, you know.

129
00:14:23,512 --> 00:14:27,778
I was just rather curious
about our precious Mr. Fogg.

130
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:32,213
I suppose he'll be hectoring me soon
for someone to fill your place.

131
00:14:32,855 --> 00:14:35,085
Thank you for your cooperation, Foster.

132
00:14:36,158 --> 00:14:37,785
We must pray for guidance.

133
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:42,556
You have a nice little position
for a gentleman's gentleman, sir?

134
00:14:47,436 --> 00:14:49,427
- For you?
- Yes, sir.

135
00:14:52,508 --> 00:14:54,738
Never doubt for one instant, Foster...

136
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:56,805
the efficacy of prayer.

137
00:14:59,582 --> 00:15:00,446
What is your name?

138
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:02,414
Passepartout.

139
00:15:05,254 --> 00:15:07,779
I am from a very ancient family, sir.

140
00:15:12,561 --> 00:15:13,619
Obviously.

141
00:15:16,632 --> 00:15:20,124
You've had a rather speckled career, I see.
Professor of gymnastics...

142
00:15:20,302 --> 00:15:23,738
- Yes, sir. Watch.
- No demonstrations, please.

143
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:27,805
Trapeze artist, fireman, chimney sweep.

144
00:15:28,777 --> 00:15:32,213
- Amazing. How did you come to England?
- In a clothes basket, sir.

145
00:15:32,548 --> 00:15:33,572
I escaped.

146
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:35,707
- From what?
- Women, sir.

147
00:15:36,318 --> 00:15:37,478
A ladies' man?

148
00:15:38,587 --> 00:15:40,452
There are no women in this household.

149
00:15:40,823 --> 00:15:42,620
Now, my conditions are strict.

150
00:15:42,825 --> 00:15:44,816
My timetable never varies.

151
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:47,387
When I say breakfast at 8:24...

152
00:15:47,496 --> 00:15:49,987
- I do not mean at 8:23 or at 8:25.
- Yes, sir.

153
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:52,329
- Do you have a watch?
- Yes, sir.

154
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:53,967
It's probably wrong.

155
00:16:00,476 --> 00:16:02,774
Very well. See that you behave yourself.

156
00:16:02,945 --> 00:16:04,810
Any tomfoolery and out you go.

157
00:16:07,082 --> 00:16:11,314
Come on, Ralph, don't be so secretive.
You're one of the governors of the bank.

158
00:16:11,453 --> 00:16:14,115
Yes. Let's have some lurid details.

159
00:16:14,323 --> 00:16:16,120
Nothing to tell.
You've read the newspapers.

160
00:16:16,325 --> 00:16:17,849
They always exaggerate.

161
00:16:18,293 --> 00:16:21,626
You mean to say the thief
actually got away with £55,000?

162
00:16:21,797 --> 00:16:23,230
He did, in brand new bank notes.

163
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:26,562
Large denominations, £500 or £1,000 each.

164
00:16:26,702 --> 00:16:29,193
How did you know?
We didn't disclose that to the press.

165
00:16:29,371 --> 00:16:30,463
I assumed it.

166
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:34,303
£55,000 of small currency would have
needed a handcart to transport it.

167
00:16:34,543 --> 00:16:37,341
It must have been compact enough
to stuff into one's pockets.

168
00:16:37,546 --> 00:16:40,640
You're right. The man's audacity
staggers the imagination.

169
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:43,047
Imagine sauntering up
to the head cashier's table...

170
00:16:43,185 --> 00:16:45,551
and pilfering a sum like that
from under his nose.

171
00:16:45,688 --> 00:16:47,178
Serves you right, in a way.

172
00:16:47,356 --> 00:16:50,985
Surely you have a better hiding place
for your funds than the cashier's nose.

173
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:54,755
Your persiflage does not amuse.
This has been an unexpected blow to us.

174
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:56,292
Unexpected, Mr. Ralph?

175
00:16:56,565 --> 00:16:59,796
Bankers must expect robbery
the same way chickens expect hawks.

176
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:02,563
It's an occupational hazard.
My lead, I believe.

177
00:17:02,805 --> 00:17:06,172
By the way, what was the head cashier
doing at the time?

178
00:17:06,341 --> 00:17:09,401
He was writing a receipt
for the three-shilling deposit.

179
00:17:10,312 --> 00:17:13,839
Go ahead and jeer. We'll lay the culprit
by the heels soon enough.

180
00:17:14,016 --> 00:17:16,109
We've notified detectives
all over the world...

181
00:17:16,218 --> 00:17:17,617
from Liverpool to Cairo.

182
00:17:17,753 --> 00:17:21,189
We've issued descriptions throughout
Europe and America. He won't get far.

183
00:17:21,323 --> 00:17:23,450
I wouldn't underestimate him
if I were you.

184
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:25,686
You're dealing
with a rather exceptional person.

185
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:27,227
Really? In what way?

186
00:17:27,396 --> 00:17:30,490
Only a cool and logical man
could have engineered such an exploit.

187
00:17:30,566 --> 00:17:33,194
Obviously a gentleman
with a considerable presence of mind.

188
00:17:33,368 --> 00:17:36,201
You seem to know rather more
about this affair than the police.

189
00:17:36,405 --> 00:17:38,532
Merely what one might deduce
from the facts.

190
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,766
Our trick.

191
00:17:40,342 --> 00:17:43,004
If you ask me,
I'd say the odds were in favor of the thief.

192
00:17:43,178 --> 00:17:47,308
If he's a resourceful chap, as Fogg says,
he'll find plenty of places to hide.

193
00:17:47,449 --> 00:17:50,145
Yes. The world's
a pretty large affair, after all.

194
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:52,613
It was 100 years ago, not any longer.

195
00:17:52,721 --> 00:17:55,019
A man can girdle the globe now
in three months.

196
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:57,284
Less than that, to be precise. In 80 days.

197
00:17:57,426 --> 00:18:01,123
You mean a complete tour
all around the world in 80 days?

198
00:18:01,296 --> 00:18:02,593
I mean just that.

199
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:05,728
- He's talking nonsense.
- No, Fogg may have a point there.

200
00:18:05,901 --> 00:18:08,631
The Great Indian Peninsula Railway
was opened a fortnight ago.

201
00:18:08,804 --> 00:18:11,432
That shortens the trip.
I read it in <i>The Daily Telegraph</i>.

202
00:18:11,607 --> 00:18:13,768
Hang <i>The Daily Telegraph</i>.
I say it's impossible.

203
00:18:13,909 --> 00:18:15,274
Nothing is impossible.

204
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:19,540
When science conquers the air it may
be feasible to circle the globe in 80 hours.

205
00:18:19,715 --> 00:18:22,411
It's a beautiful dream,
but I'm talking about this moment...

206
00:18:22,551 --> 00:18:25,111
and I say nobody
can go around the world in 80 days.

207
00:18:25,287 --> 00:18:26,379
I agree.

208
00:18:26,488 --> 00:18:28,956
Even if one made ideal connections
at every point...

209
00:18:29,158 --> 00:18:32,719
there'd still be typhoons, shipwrecks,
unforeseen delays.

210
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:34,488
I include the unforeseen.

211
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:38,996
All very glib, Fogg,
but I'd like to see you do it in 80 days.

212
00:18:39,501 --> 00:18:41,366
You're convinced that I could not?

213
00:18:41,637 --> 00:18:45,937
So much so
that I'll wager £5,000 that you can't.

214
00:18:46,909 --> 00:18:50,037
Let me understand you clearly.
Are you formally challenging me...

215
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:52,544
to undertake a journey
around the world in 80 days?

216
00:18:52,648 --> 00:18:56,812
I am, and I'm prepared to back
my conviction by posting my check now.

217
00:18:57,519 --> 00:18:58,952
Very well, I accept.

218
00:18:59,154 --> 00:19:01,850
This is absurd. The joke's gone far enough.

219
00:19:02,124 --> 00:19:04,456
An Englishman never jokes about a wager.

220
00:19:06,328 --> 00:19:09,923
I have on deposit at Barings Bank
the sum of £20,000.

221
00:19:10,098 --> 00:19:13,124
I'm willing to wager any or all of it
upon the same contention.

222
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:16,432
Namely, that I can complete
a tour of the world in 80 days.

223
00:19:16,805 --> 00:19:21,208
That is to say,
in 1,920 hours or 115,200 minutes.

224
00:19:21,944 --> 00:19:24,242
Would anyone besides Stuart
care to participate?

225
00:19:24,379 --> 00:19:27,610
I'm no gambler,
but if you want to make foolhardy bets...

226
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:31,116
that you can't possibly win,
I'm afraid I'll be forced to take you on.

227
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:32,117
I'm with you.

228
00:19:32,321 --> 00:19:34,619
So am I. What about you, Ralph?

229
00:19:34,957 --> 00:19:38,358
My affiliation with the Bank of England
naturally precludes my betting...

230
00:19:38,493 --> 00:19:41,860
but as a member of this club I might,
under very special circumstances.

231
00:19:41,997 --> 00:19:43,021
Then it's agreed?

232
00:19:43,131 --> 00:19:44,496
- We all accept?
- Yes.

233
00:19:44,633 --> 00:19:47,363
Good. If I remember correctly,
the boat train for Dover...

234
00:19:47,536 --> 00:19:50,004
leaves London Bridge station
at 8:45 tonight.

235
00:19:50,205 --> 00:19:51,672
- I will be on it.
- Tonight?

236
00:19:51,874 --> 00:19:54,104
Don't you need some days
to settle your affairs...

237
00:19:54,243 --> 00:19:56,905
- to make preparations?
- No. I'm quite ready now.

238
00:19:57,312 --> 00:20:00,042
You engage to be back here in London,
in the Reform Club...

239
00:20:00,215 --> 00:20:04,811
on Saturday, September 21 at 8:45 p.m.

240
00:20:06,989 --> 00:20:09,651
Right, gentlemen.
Clubs, I believe, are still trumps?

241
00:20:10,192 --> 00:20:11,819
Shall we finish the game?

242
00:20:58,373 --> 00:21:00,807
- Yes, please?
<i>- Come to my bedroom at once.</i>

243
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,499
Yes, sir.

244
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:38,369
- I called you twice.
- I came as fast as possible, sir.

245
00:21:40,148 --> 00:21:42,275
You are not supposed to be home yet, sir.

246
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:44,181
My usual routine is beside the point.

247
00:21:44,419 --> 00:21:46,182
We leave for the Continent in 10 minutes.

248
00:21:46,355 --> 00:21:49,188
- <i>Monsieur</i> is going traveling?
- Yes. Around the world.

249
00:21:50,959 --> 00:21:53,223
Then you will not be here for breakfast.

250
00:21:54,363 --> 00:21:56,024
Around the world?

251
00:21:56,498 --> 00:21:59,626
Exactly. Now reassemble your faculties
and start packing.

252
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:10,772
Which clothes does <i>monsieur</i>...
I mean, which trunks?

253
00:22:10,979 --> 00:22:15,143
None whatever. Just take two shirts
and three pairs of hose for each of us.

254
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:18,212
- But I have only one shirt, sir.
- Then take that.

255
00:22:18,387 --> 00:22:21,788
We'll buy whatever else we need en route.
Give me that red bag.

256
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,995
Open it up.
We're going to need plenty of money.

257
00:22:37,005 --> 00:22:40,338
Whatever you do,
never let this out of your sight.

258
00:22:40,475 --> 00:22:44,707
<i>Monsieur</i> can trust me.
I will cherish it like a woman.

259
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:47,005
Don't make love to it. Just watch it.

260
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:49,268
Excuse me, sir. My cousin.

261
00:23:53,248 --> 00:23:54,408
<i>Mademoiselle.</i>

262
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,987
Excuse me, sir. It's not my cousin.

263
00:24:19,274 --> 00:24:20,707
Thomas Cook and Son.

264
00:25:49,931 --> 00:25:52,161
You purchase the tickets.
I'll be back in a moment.

265
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,528
All right, sir.

266
00:26:02,043 --> 00:26:04,307
Now, <i>monsieur</i>, train to Marseilles...

267
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:08,245
steamer to Bombay via Suez,
across India by train...

268
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:10,315
and steamer again to Hong Kong.

269
00:26:10,952 --> 00:26:12,112
Only one drawback.

270
00:26:12,387 --> 00:26:14,947
With this route,
you miss Bali and the women.

271
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,451
But no, women of Bali
cannot be described.

272
00:26:21,963 --> 00:26:25,228
- Please try.
- No, <i>monsieur</i>. Words would fail me.

273
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:29,831
In any case, in Yokohama,
you will encounter the geisha girls...

274
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:32,901
and those, <i>monsieur</i>,
are not to be sneezed at.

275
00:26:33,441 --> 00:26:34,738
I shall remember.

276
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:39,510
In Yokohama,
I must not sneeze at geisha girls.

277
00:26:40,949 --> 00:26:43,509
Then, between San Francisco
and New York...

278
00:26:43,918 --> 00:26:46,648
you will discover Indian maidens galore...

279
00:26:47,055 --> 00:26:50,286
statuesque, barbaric creatures.

280
00:26:50,959 --> 00:26:53,325
What a crime you have only 80 days.

281
00:26:53,495 --> 00:26:55,827
However, first things first.

282
00:26:56,264 --> 00:26:58,926
Here are your tickets to Marseilles.

283
00:26:59,801 --> 00:27:02,235
Cancel those tickets.
They are of no further use to us.

284
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:03,803
We cannot go by train.

285
00:27:03,972 --> 00:27:05,564
Has something happened? A wreck?

286
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:07,867
An avalanche has sealed
the Montfort tunnel...

287
00:27:07,976 --> 00:27:09,705
and nothing can get through for a week.

288
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:13,041
Then the roads are blocked, too.
How can we go on?

289
00:27:13,415 --> 00:27:16,612
I don't know. But I refuse to be daunted
at this stage of the game.

290
00:27:16,751 --> 00:27:19,185
There must be another way.
There has to be.

291
00:27:19,587 --> 00:27:21,578
But after all, we are not birds.

292
00:27:21,823 --> 00:27:23,950
We cannot fly across the mountains.

293
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:28,596
That, <i>monsieur</i>, is not unfeasible,
fantastic as it seems.

294
00:27:35,203 --> 00:27:36,500
Isn't she lovely?

295
00:27:38,506 --> 00:27:41,703
I have made 63 ascents, gentlemen...

296
00:27:42,177 --> 00:27:44,270
to an elevation over 1,000 meters.

297
00:27:44,612 --> 00:27:48,173
I've flown through the skies
at a speed surpassing that of an eagle.

298
00:27:48,683 --> 00:27:51,811
Are you quite sure
this is not just Gallic braggadocio?

299
00:27:52,887 --> 00:27:57,085
You are now addressing the second
most-celebrated balloonist in Europe.

300
00:27:57,225 --> 00:27:59,250
- And who is the first?
- He is not available.

301
00:27:59,361 --> 00:28:01,454
He was buried last Tuesday.

302
00:28:01,996 --> 00:28:05,022
Tell me, is this apparatus of yours
for lease?

303
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:07,097
If I operate it, yes.

304
00:28:07,969 --> 00:28:09,994
If you do, it's only for sale.

305
00:28:11,406 --> 00:28:13,670
- Passepartout, the bag.
- Yes, sir.

306
00:28:20,315 --> 00:28:24,342
- We purchase your balloon, sir.
- Thank you, sir.

307
00:30:30,044 --> 00:30:32,911
It's really very simple.
We empty out some sand...

308
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:37,015
and we go up.

309
00:30:37,151 --> 00:30:39,016
Then we pull this...

310
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:42,920
and with any luck, we come down.

311
00:30:43,291 --> 00:30:46,419
I imagine we release some gas
from the top of the balloon.

312
00:30:46,628 --> 00:30:50,758
Gas! I forgot to turn off the gas
in my room.

313
00:30:52,166 --> 00:30:54,930
No matter. It will continue to burn,
at your expense.

314
00:35:03,151 --> 00:35:06,348
Gentlemen, I think this calls
for a restrained celebration.

315
00:35:07,121 --> 00:35:09,589
Guess what's become
of the intrepid Mr. Fogg?

316
00:35:10,491 --> 00:35:13,483
- What?
- He's drifting over the Alps in a balloon.

317
00:35:14,328 --> 00:35:16,421
What's he doing in one of those?

318
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:18,590
Don't ask me, but it's here in this paper.

319
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:20,826
I say, he never mentioned
the word balloon.

320
00:35:20,968 --> 00:35:22,196
Not very sporting, is it?

321
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:26,602
Rather sly, if you ask me.
I wouldn't have thought it of old Fogg.

322
00:35:26,741 --> 00:35:29,175
I don't know,
seems quite resourceful to me.

323
00:35:29,443 --> 00:35:32,139
English ingenuity, never say die,
all that sort of thing.

324
00:35:32,313 --> 00:35:34,975
Does it happen to mention
over which Alps he's drifting?

325
00:35:35,149 --> 00:35:37,276
No. I assumed they were the ones
in Switzerland.

326
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:38,682
Use your globe, sir.

327
00:35:38,853 --> 00:35:41,515
Could be the Maritime Alps,
in the south of France.

328
00:35:41,656 --> 00:35:45,092
In which case Fogg's not only
on schedule, but ahead of it.

329
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:47,251
We stand to lose £20,000.

330
00:35:47,428 --> 00:35:50,522
What was that you said
about a celebration, Stuart?

331
00:35:51,465 --> 00:35:54,798
If nobody wants this newspaper,
I'll just put it on the table.

332
00:36:03,544 --> 00:36:05,671
The southern perimeter of France.

333
00:36:05,813 --> 00:36:09,806
Often and with justification referred to
in the guidebooks as the "Azure Coast."

334
00:36:09,917 --> 00:36:12,647
- The moment is propitious for our descent.
- Yes, sir.

335
00:36:20,228 --> 00:36:23,061
The gas valve's stuck, I think.
Can you get up there?

336
00:36:23,831 --> 00:36:25,264
I'll try it, master.

337
00:37:49,417 --> 00:37:51,408
They're speaking some
bizarre foreign tongue.

338
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:53,009
- Do you understand them?
- Yes.

339
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:55,347
Ask them how far
we are from Marseilles...

340
00:37:55,456 --> 00:37:57,686
and what conveyance
they have for us to proceed.

341
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:15,935
- Why aren't they speaking French?
- Because we are in Spain, master.

342
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:18,037
- Spain?
- Yes, sir.

343
00:38:21,649 --> 00:38:23,913
It's a long trip to Marseilles.

344
00:38:24,318 --> 00:38:27,776
But by sea, in a fast boat, 10 hours.

345
00:38:28,289 --> 00:38:30,416
Where would we procure such a boat?

346
00:38:39,066 --> 00:38:43,469
There is one vessel here.
The boat of Abdul Achmed of Tangiers.

347
00:38:44,138 --> 00:38:46,129
Where would we find this worthy?

348
00:38:59,987 --> 00:39:01,511
He sleeps by day.

349
00:39:01,689 --> 00:39:04,453
But at night,
he's in the Cave of the Seven Winds.

350
00:43:17,544 --> 00:43:20,945
- Think that's the man we're looking for?
- I think so, master.

351
00:43:44,571 --> 00:43:46,129
Excuse me, master.

352
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:19,557
Good evening, sir.

353
00:45:21,101 --> 00:45:24,127
It is forbidden to approach
his august personage.

354
00:45:24,238 --> 00:45:26,263
Perhaps you would transmit a message?

355
00:45:26,373 --> 00:45:29,399
I would like to engage his yacht
for a quick trip to Marseilles.

356
00:45:29,510 --> 00:45:31,501
I will pay whatever he asks.

357
00:45:44,124 --> 00:45:47,423
The ship is yours, sir.
Go where you wish without charge.

358
00:45:47,561 --> 00:45:50,894
However, my master
is an aficionado of the bullfight.

359
00:45:51,398 --> 00:45:54,834
That is why he visits here,
to see the festival of the bulls.

360
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:56,469
I do not understand.

361
00:45:56,637 --> 00:46:00,368
He was most interested
in your servant's display of cape work.

362
00:46:00,541 --> 00:46:03,772
He would like to see more tomorrow,
at the bullfight.

363
00:46:04,912 --> 00:46:07,506
You mean he wants him to enter the ring?

364
00:46:08,348 --> 00:46:10,077
But that will be a massacre!

365
00:46:10,284 --> 00:46:13,310
Please, master. I'm not afraid. Let me try.

366
00:50:40,153 --> 00:50:42,212
Don't push me.

367
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:47,855
It's the first time I've seen a real bull.

368
00:50:52,032 --> 00:50:55,490
Look at the horns. It's not my size.
Try to be nice to me.
