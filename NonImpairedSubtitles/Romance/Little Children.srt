---www.opensubtitles.org---

2
00:00:33,233 --> 00:00:36,532
Want to take a walk with me?

3
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:24,007
...continue to protest the
presence of a convicted sex offender

4
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,513
in their neighborhood.
Michelle Betler reports.

5
00:01:26,545 --> 00:01:29,246
Thanks, Rick. l'm standing
here on Woodward Court,

6
00:01:29,283 --> 00:01:30,981
the quiet residential street

7
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,185
that has become the focus of controversy

8
00:01:33,224 --> 00:01:36,461
ever since 48-year-old Ronald
James McGorvey returned here

9
00:01:36,496 --> 00:01:38,296
after serving a
two-year prison sentence

10
00:01:38,332 --> 00:01:40,362
for indecent exposure to a minor.

11
00:01:40,403 --> 00:01:42,432
ln the past few days an organization

12
00:01:42,474 --> 00:01:44,605
known as the Committee
of Concerned Parents

13
00:01:44,644 --> 00:01:47,779
began distributing these
notices throughout the community

14
00:01:47,817 --> 00:01:50,051
warning neighbors of
what they call a quote,

15
00:01:50,088 --> 00:01:52,083
"Dangerous predator in our midst."

16
00:01:52,125 --> 00:01:55,623
l don't really like having
him that close to my family.

17
00:01:55,664 --> 00:01:59,301
l think it's outrageous. This
block has too many children

18
00:01:59,338 --> 00:02:02,312
for a sex offender to, uh,
be moving in the neighborhood.

19
00:02:02,343 --> 00:02:04,212
l don't think it's a good idea.

20
00:02:04,247 --> 00:02:06,685
Makes me very nervous.
Makes me a little enraged.

21
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:09,716
Um, l'd have a problem if
l see him on the street.

22
00:02:09,757 --> 00:02:11,991
lt's like having an
alcoholic work in a bar.

23
00:02:12,028 --> 00:02:14,398
They don't mix. They
shouldn't be together.

24
00:02:14,433 --> 00:02:17,601
The conditions of his parole
expressly forbid McGorvey

25
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:19,769
to be within 100 yards
of any playground,

26
00:02:19,808 --> 00:02:23,445
school or recreation area
where children normally gather.

27
00:02:23,482 --> 00:02:25,511
These conditions seem
to be of little comfort

28
00:02:25,553 --> 00:02:28,186
to the many parents whose
children play and go to school

29
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:30,025
in this formerly tranquil community,

30
00:02:30,061 --> 00:02:33,468
and who in the coming days and
weeks will be hoping for the best

31
00:02:33,501 --> 00:02:36,339
but preparing for the
worst. Rick, back to you.

32
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:50,192
My husband and l had an
actual spiritual experience.

33
00:02:50,231 --> 00:02:53,468
We did this intense spa treatment-

34
00:02:53,504 --> 00:02:55,168
- Oh, come on.
- No, listen to me.

35
00:02:55,207 --> 00:02:58,581
lt was on our vacation in Cabo
and there were eight other couples

36
00:02:58,614 --> 00:03:00,779
and this Mayan woman.

37
00:03:00,818 --> 00:03:02,914
A goddess, just a goddess.

38
00:03:02,955 --> 00:03:04,390
- She had- - She's
due in September.

39
00:03:04,424 --> 00:03:06,989
She thinks she's gonna
take three months off,

40
00:03:07,029 --> 00:03:09,662
then it's Christmas, then she'll be
back to work the first of the year.

41
00:03:09,701 --> 00:03:11,262
Please.

42
00:03:11,303 --> 00:03:14,278
Six months from now she'll be
right here on this bench with us.

43
00:03:14,308 --> 00:03:16,213
My friend Beth said
that the way she did it

44
00:03:16,246 --> 00:03:19,585
was to just take him with her
every time she went to the bathroom.

45
00:03:19,619 --> 00:03:22,685
- l find that strange.
- Yeah, that's what l said to Beth.

46
00:03:22,725 --> 00:03:24,160
lt's Oedipal.

47
00:03:24,194 --> 00:03:26,131
What's the rush?

48
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:29,264
Although l will say, when l was
trying to pom-train Christian,

49
00:03:29,303 --> 00:03:32,106
l opened the diaper and it was huge!

50
00:03:32,142 --> 00:03:33,908
Like a grown man.

51
00:03:33,944 --> 00:03:37,581
Smiling politely to mask a
familiar feeling of desperation

52
00:03:37,618 --> 00:03:41,527
Sarah reminded herself to
think like an anthropologist.

53
00:03:41,559 --> 00:03:45,594
She was a researcher studying the
behavior of typical suburban women.

54
00:03:45,633 --> 00:03:47,194
They weren't organic?

55
00:03:47,236 --> 00:03:50,233
She was not a typical
suburban woman herself.

56
00:03:50,275 --> 00:03:52,509
Troy, stop that!

57
00:03:52,546 --> 00:03:54,015
Paul and l were having
sex the other night

58
00:03:54,048 --> 00:03:56,179
and l drifted off right
in the middle of it.

59
00:03:56,219 --> 00:03:58,054
lt happens.

60
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:01,223
Yeah, l guess. But when
l woke up and apologized

61
00:04:01,262 --> 00:04:03,096
he said he hadn't even noticed.

62
00:04:03,132 --> 00:04:04,864
You know what you should do?

63
00:04:04,901 --> 00:04:07,569
Set aside a specific
block of time for it.

64
00:04:07,607 --> 00:04:10,410
That's what Louis and l do
- every Tuesday night at 9:OO.

65
00:04:10,445 --> 00:04:12,474
"Whether you want to
or not" Sarah thought,

66
00:04:12,515 --> 00:04:14,887
her eyes straying over to the play area.

67
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:19,192
Even at such a tiny playground as this

68
00:04:19,228 --> 00:04:22,431
Lucy didn't interact much
with the other children.

69
00:04:22,467 --> 00:04:24,963
Sarah didn't really know why
they even bothered coming here,

70
00:04:25,005 --> 00:04:27,068
except that she'd probably go crazy

71
00:04:27,109 --> 00:04:28,841
trapped in the house all day

72
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:31,044
with this unknowable little person.

73
00:04:38,296 --> 00:04:40,097
Morning snack time
was 10:30 on the dot...

74
00:04:40,133 --> 00:04:42,367
Snack time!

75
00:04:42,404 --> 00:04:45,071
...a regimen established
and maintained by Mary Ann,

76
00:04:45,109 --> 00:04:47,810
who believed that rigid
adherence to a timetable

77
00:04:47,847 --> 00:04:49,751
was not only the key
to a healthy marriage,

78
00:04:49,784 --> 00:04:51,847
but to effective parenting as well.

79
00:04:51,888 --> 00:04:54,487
- l'll take this one!
- l want that one!

80
00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:59,866
- Can l do it?
- Yeah. Ready?

81
00:05:02,774 --> 00:05:05,441
Mommy...

82
00:05:05,479 --> 00:05:07,474
where's my snack?

83
00:05:07,517 --> 00:05:09,887
l'm sorry, honey, Mommy can't find it.

84
00:05:09,922 --> 00:05:12,190
- l forgot the rice cakes.
- Poor thing.

85
00:05:12,226 --> 00:05:14,289
- l'm sure it's in here somewhere.
- Second time this week.

86
00:05:14,329 --> 00:05:16,233
Well, who's going to
keep track of everything?

87
00:05:16,266 --> 00:05:18,534
- Bad mommy. Bad mommy.
- Just calm down, please.

88
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:22,343
No calm down! l want my snack!

89
00:05:22,377 --> 00:05:24,748
All right, you know what? It's-

90
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:27,654
it's just not here,
okay? See for yourself.

91
00:05:31,026 --> 00:05:32,690
Wait!

92
00:05:32,729 --> 00:05:35,670
Troy, honey, give Lucy your goldfish.

93
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:37,468
No!

94
00:05:37,505 --> 00:05:39,271
Troy Jonathan, give me those goldfish!

95
00:05:39,308 --> 00:05:40,778
But, Mama, they're mine.

96
00:05:40,811 --> 00:05:43,341
No back talk. You can
share with your sister.

97
00:05:43,382 --> 00:05:45,617
Troy has goldfish for you. Go sit down.

98
00:05:45,653 --> 00:05:47,784
That's much more than 10.

99
00:05:47,824 --> 00:05:50,297
- That's great.
- Look how big l made my lawn.

100
00:05:50,329 --> 00:05:52,824
Thank you, Mary Ann,
you're a life saver.

101
00:05:52,866 --> 00:05:56,205
lt's nothing. l just hate
to see her suffer like that.

102
00:05:57,876 --> 00:06:00,440
Maybe you should make a
checklist and tape it to the door

103
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,976
so it's the last thing you
see before leaving the house.

104
00:06:03,019 --> 00:06:05,150
That's what l do.

105
00:06:05,189 --> 00:06:08,962
Yeah, thank you. That's
- that's a really helpful suggestion.

106
00:06:10,566 --> 00:06:12,127
You're welcome.

107
00:06:12,169 --> 00:06:14,368
Drink your juice.

108
00:06:14,406 --> 00:06:16,240
Are you the plane again?

109
00:06:16,276 --> 00:06:17,576
Look.

110
00:06:17,612 --> 00:06:20,084
Now you have to act like me.

111
00:06:20,116 --> 00:06:22,521
The prom king.

112
00:06:22,555 --> 00:06:26,122
Oh my God, he's back.

113
00:06:26,161 --> 00:06:27,962
Sarah followed the other women's gazes

114
00:06:27,998 --> 00:06:29,399
over to the entrance of the playground,

115
00:06:29,433 --> 00:06:32,670
eager to finally get a
glimpse of the prom king,

116
00:06:32,706 --> 00:06:35,236
the handsome and mysterious young father

117
00:06:35,277 --> 00:06:37,477
who had been a regular at
the Walker Street playground

118
00:06:37,515 --> 00:06:40,182
for several weeks this past spring

119
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:43,286
before abruptly dropping out of sight.

120
00:06:43,326 --> 00:06:47,064
l don't need a rest. l
need an airplane ride.

121
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:50,131
His departure had left a gaping
hole in the emotional lives

122
00:06:50,171 --> 00:06:52,610
of Cheryl, Theresa and Mary Ann.

123
00:06:52,643 --> 00:06:55,743
Barely a day went by without
one of them speculating wis_ully

124
00:06:55,782 --> 00:06:59,349
about the reason for his absence
and the likelihood of his return.

125
00:07:01,292 --> 00:07:05,532
Here l come. There's no
room for two of us, diesel.

126
00:07:05,567 --> 00:07:08,005
You've done it again.

127
00:07:08,037 --> 00:07:09,668
l hate steam engines.

128
00:07:09,707 --> 00:07:12,648
When l come back l will
pinch you with my pinchers.

129
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:16,247
Yeah? Well, when l come back

130
00:07:16,286 --> 00:07:17,985
l'm gonna ram you with my rammer.

131
00:07:18,023 --> 00:07:19,926
- Ready?
- No, you won't.

132
00:07:22,431 --> 00:07:26,876
Every time you win, diesel!

133
00:07:26,906 --> 00:07:29,812
l know.

134
00:07:29,844 --> 00:07:32,545
- Hello!
- Mommy's home.

135
00:07:32,582 --> 00:07:35,524
The jester's cap was something
that truly disturbed Brad.

136
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:38,860
All day long the boy ate,
played and napped in it.

137
00:07:38,894 --> 00:07:42,895
But the moment his mother stepped in
the house he had no more use for it.

138
00:07:42,935 --> 00:07:45,340
As if the entire day up to that point

139
00:07:45,373 --> 00:07:48,313
had been a pointless and
somewhat useless charade.

140
00:07:48,345 --> 00:07:50,476
You got some sun today, didn't you?

141
00:07:50,516 --> 00:07:53,251
Did Daddy forget the sunscreen again?

142
00:07:55,024 --> 00:07:57,759
What are you doing?

143
00:07:57,796 --> 00:08:01,260
That's his full name. What's
your favorite thing about him?

144
00:08:01,302 --> 00:08:03,798
Um...

145
00:08:03,841 --> 00:08:06,211
l like to come over to his house.

146
00:08:06,245 --> 00:08:07,681
Hmm.

147
00:08:10,686 --> 00:08:14,151
l think l'm gonna finally
break down and get a cell phone.

148
00:08:14,193 --> 00:08:16,358
- Really?
- Mmm.

149
00:08:16,397 --> 00:08:17,832
Why?

150
00:08:21,206 --> 00:08:23,302
l have no way of reaching
you when l'm out with Aaron.

151
00:08:23,342 --> 00:08:24,676
You're done, right?

152
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:29,047
You've got one.

153
00:08:29,087 --> 00:08:31,025
Don't you think it's
strange that l don't?

154
00:08:31,057 --> 00:08:34,932
Yeah, l do. You just
never wanted one before.

155
00:08:34,964 --> 00:08:37,266
Yeah, l know.

156
00:08:37,302 --> 00:08:40,870
There's a family plan.
We can talk for free.

157
00:08:42,812 --> 00:08:44,578
Okay.

158
00:08:44,614 --> 00:08:47,214
Let's just see where we
are at the end of the month.

159
00:08:47,253 --> 00:08:48,848
Yeah?

160
00:08:48,889 --> 00:08:52,092
Are your hands okay?

161
00:09:07,323 --> 00:09:09,659
As was her custom each
week night after dinner,

162
00:09:09,694 --> 00:09:13,000
the boy's mother sent Brad
down to the municipal library

163
00:09:13,034 --> 00:09:16,133
to study for the bar exam.

164
00:09:16,172 --> 00:09:19,513
But he never quite made it
through the door of the building.

165
00:09:22,284 --> 00:09:25,783
Brad had been watching the
skateboarders for weeks now,

166
00:09:25,824 --> 00:09:28,354
sometimes for as long
as an hour at a stretch.

167
00:09:28,396 --> 00:09:31,565
But he never received the slightest
acknowledgement from any of them.

168
00:09:33,171 --> 00:09:37,137
He'd been the same age as
these boys when his mother died.

169
00:09:37,178 --> 00:09:39,275
- You do that!
- No way!

170
00:09:39,315 --> 00:09:41,413
- Nice.
- Hey, that was nice, dude!

171
00:09:41,453 --> 00:09:44,222
"l must have been like
this," Brad sometimes thought.

172
00:09:44,258 --> 00:09:48,464
"l must have been one of them."

173
00:09:51,972 --> 00:09:53,340
Awful.

174
00:09:55,244 --> 00:09:57,615
He should be castrated.

175
00:09:57,649 --> 00:09:59,382
Quick and clean, just chop it off.

176
00:09:59,419 --> 00:10:01,687
Then you wouldn't have to worry
about noti_ing the neighbors.

177
00:10:01,723 --> 00:10:03,591
You know what else you should do?

178
00:10:03,626 --> 00:10:06,692
Nail his penis above the
entrance to the elementary school.

179
00:10:06,732 --> 00:10:09,433
You know, as a warning
to other perverts.

180
00:10:09,471 --> 00:10:11,271
You think this is funny?

181
00:10:11,308 --> 00:10:14,875
l just can't believe you want to
castrate a man for indecent exposure.

182
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:17,752
My brother used to expose himself when-

183
00:10:17,785 --> 00:10:20,225
when we were teenagers.
He'd do it in my bedroom,

184
00:10:20,257 --> 00:10:22,822
he'd do it in the dining room, he'd
do it in the back seat of a car.

185
00:10:22,862 --> 00:10:26,304
He'd always figure out a way to do it
so that nobody could see him except me.

186
00:10:26,335 --> 00:10:28,534
Didn't you tell anyone?

187
00:10:28,572 --> 00:10:30,544
No, l didn't want to get him in trouble.

188
00:10:30,576 --> 00:10:32,479
Maybe he should be castrated.

189
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:37,188
lt's not the same thing. He
wasn't doing it to strangers.

190
00:10:37,222 --> 00:10:39,991
Oh my God, there he is.

191
00:10:40,027 --> 00:10:42,660
After all this time, two days in a row.

192
00:10:42,698 --> 00:10:44,191
Where's the fire?

193
00:10:44,235 --> 00:10:46,902
Maybe he needed a vacation.

194
00:10:46,939 --> 00:10:49,378
From what?

195
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:51,575
From being the prom king.

196
00:10:51,615 --> 00:10:54,019
lt's a dirty job, but
someone's gotta do it.

197
00:10:57,693 --> 00:10:59,892
- Close it?
- Close it.

198
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:03,201
Close the gate. There you go.

199
00:11:03,236 --> 00:11:05,801
- It's open.
- It's all right.

200
00:11:05,841 --> 00:11:08,974
- Somebody else will close it.
- Are we practicing?

201
00:11:11,184 --> 00:11:13,919
Are we playing up on the swings?

202
00:11:13,955 --> 00:11:16,018
Swing time!

203
00:11:20,968 --> 00:11:22,803
What's he do for a living?

204
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:26,577
We've never actually spoken to him.

205
00:11:26,613 --> 00:11:27,980
Really?

206
00:11:28,014 --> 00:11:30,420
We don't even know his name.

207
00:11:30,453 --> 00:11:33,587
l thought you guys said
he was a regular here.

208
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:35,860
- It was awkward.
- He made us nervous.

209
00:11:35,896 --> 00:11:39,099
You had to think about what you
were gonna wear in the morning.

210
00:11:39,136 --> 00:11:41,803
You know, put on makeup.
It was exhausting.

211
00:11:51,091 --> 00:11:53,461
Mommy, push me!

212
00:11:53,495 --> 00:11:57,165
Okay. l'll be right there.

213
00:12:00,341 --> 00:12:03,714
Wait!

214
00:12:03,747 --> 00:12:05,981
Five bucks if you get his phone number.

215
00:12:12,763 --> 00:12:15,293
How old is she?

216
00:12:15,335 --> 00:12:16,828
Lucy,

217
00:12:16,871 --> 00:12:19,743
tell the nice boy how old you are.

218
00:12:19,776 --> 00:12:22,215
l'm three.

219
00:12:22,248 --> 00:12:24,550
My grandma lives in New Jersey.

220
00:12:24,585 --> 00:12:27,651
She doesn't have a swim pool.

221
00:12:27,691 --> 00:12:29,252
Do you like to swim?

222
00:12:29,294 --> 00:12:32,633
l don't like sharks. They eat you up.

223
00:12:32,667 --> 00:12:34,662
Don't listen to him.

224
00:12:34,704 --> 00:12:38,077
We go to the town pool almost every day.

225
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:41,677
- l'm Brad, by the way.
- Sarah.

226
00:12:41,717 --> 00:12:44,053
You guys come here a lot?

227
00:12:44,088 --> 00:12:46,721
No, just the last few weeks.

228
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,994
l usually go to the one over on Harris,

229
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:51,332
with the big wood things, you
know, and the slide across.

230
00:12:51,368 --> 00:12:53,066
Yeah, we actually rent a
house right around the corner

231
00:12:53,104 --> 00:12:54,574
from there on Ashforth.

232
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:57,605
That ice cream truck never
leaves. Such a nightmare.

233
00:12:57,646 --> 00:13:01,315
Yeah, tell me about it.

234
00:13:01,353 --> 00:13:04,122
You know, you're the first person
here who's ever talked to me.

235
00:13:05,995 --> 00:13:09,266
You make 'em nervous.

236
00:13:09,301 --> 00:13:11,900
Oh, right.

237
00:13:11,939 --> 00:13:15,278
l guess they don't see too many
fathers here during the weekdays.

238
00:13:18,684 --> 00:13:20,815
You don't have to be
polite. Go ahead and ask.

239
00:13:20,855 --> 00:13:22,724
What?

240
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:25,962
You know, what the person who wears the
pants in the family does for a living.

241
00:13:25,998 --> 00:13:29,371
Oh. All right, what does your wife do?

242
00:13:29,404 --> 00:13:32,846
- She makes documentaries.
- Oh, wow.

243
00:13:32,877 --> 00:13:35,784
- Like Michael Moore?
- Uh, like PBS.

244
00:13:35,816 --> 00:13:38,415
Oh.

245
00:13:38,455 --> 00:13:40,483
Well, l think it's
admirable you're here.

246
00:13:40,524 --> 00:13:43,363
There's no reason fathers
can't be primary caregivers.

247
00:13:45,901 --> 00:13:47,599
l finished law school two years ago,

248
00:13:47,637 --> 00:13:51,136
but l can't seem to pass the
bar exam. Failed it twice now.

249
00:13:53,014 --> 00:13:55,921
Maybe you just don't
want to be a lawyer.

250
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:00,493
l'll take the test one more time.

251
00:14:00,528 --> 00:14:02,192
lf l mess up now

252
00:14:02,231 --> 00:14:06,403
l'll just have to find something
else to do with my life.

253
00:14:06,439 --> 00:14:09,004
- Right, buddy?
- Right.

254
00:14:09,044 --> 00:14:12,315
Sarah was shocked by how Brad
delivered this confession,

255
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:16,088
with no apparent sense of being in the
Ieast bit embarrassed by his failure.

256
00:14:16,124 --> 00:14:18,791
Most men weren't like this.

257
00:14:18,828 --> 00:14:21,769
Her husband Richard certainly wasn't.

258
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,501
She wondered if Brad was
always this forthcoming.

259
00:14:24,539 --> 00:14:27,411
lf anything, he seemed a little lonely,

260
00:14:27,445 --> 00:14:31,012
all too ready to open his heart
at the slightest sign of interest,

261
00:14:31,051 --> 00:14:33,616
like a lot of young mothers she knew.

262
00:14:33,656 --> 00:14:36,289
l couldn't help noticing your stroller.

263
00:14:36,327 --> 00:14:38,595
Do you have another child?

264
00:14:38,631 --> 00:14:41,469
No, just Aaron. Got that at a yard sale.

265
00:14:41,503 --> 00:14:44,946
Extra seat comes in handy
for the bear, though.

266
00:14:44,977 --> 00:14:48,110
Lucy refuses to go in a
stroller or a car seat.

267
00:14:48,149 --> 00:14:51,556
We have to walk everywhere. It takes
us half an hour to go three blocks,

268
00:14:51,589 --> 00:14:53,321
unless l carry her.

269
00:14:53,358 --> 00:14:57,096
- Daddy, l'm finished.
- Are you sure? We just got here.

270
00:14:57,132 --> 00:14:59,697
l'm finished right now.

271
00:14:59,737 --> 00:15:02,404
Okay. All right, here we go.

272
00:15:02,442 --> 00:15:05,507
Ready? One, two, three.

273
00:15:05,547 --> 00:15:07,314
- Oops.
- Oh, hold on for a second.

274
00:15:07,351 --> 00:15:08,684
- There, thank you.
- Are you okay?

275
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,589
No problem.

276
00:15:10,624 --> 00:15:13,758
lt was then while watching Brad
kneel down at his son's feet

277
00:15:13,796 --> 00:15:18,605
that Sarah found herself gripped
by an unexpected pang of sadness.

278
00:15:18,638 --> 00:15:21,670
"Don't go," she thought.

279
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:25,414
"Don't leave me here with the others."

280
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:29,292
- It was nice talking to you.
- Same here.

281
00:15:29,324 --> 00:15:32,527
Wait! Um...

282
00:15:32,564 --> 00:15:34,502
Come here. Just...

283
00:15:34,534 --> 00:15:36,630
come here.

284
00:15:38,775 --> 00:15:40,770
You see those women over there?

285
00:15:40,812 --> 00:15:42,909
Just, yeah, don't
- don't look.

286
00:15:42,949 --> 00:15:45,855
You know what they call you?

287
00:15:45,887 --> 00:15:47,256
What?

288
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:49,593
The prom king.

289
00:15:49,628 --> 00:15:51,292
Oh God, really?

290
00:15:51,331 --> 00:15:53,827
Yeah, they mean it as a compliment.

291
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:56,308
You're a big character
in their fantasy lives.

292
00:15:56,341 --> 00:15:57,833
Wow.

293
00:15:57,876 --> 00:16:01,182
Um, so one of them bet me $5 l
couldn't get your phone number.

294
00:16:01,217 --> 00:16:03,986
Five bucks, huh?

295
00:16:04,021 --> 00:16:05,925
Yeah.

296
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:08,363
Could we split it 50-50?

297
00:16:08,396 --> 00:16:10,459
lt could be arranged.

298
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,969
lt doesn't have to be your real number.

299
00:16:12,002 --> 00:16:14,635
Oh, well, you know, in that
case, sure. You got a pen?

300
00:16:14,674 --> 00:16:17,945
Great. Oh shit, no l
- um, no l don't.

301
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,918
- Uh...
- Well...

302
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:22,014
No wait, just
- wait.

303
00:16:22,054 --> 00:16:25,360
You know what'd really be funny?

304
00:16:25,394 --> 00:16:28,426
lf you gave me a hug.

305
00:16:28,466 --> 00:16:31,806
- You think?
- Yeah.

306
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:34,277
- Yeah.
- All right, come here.

307
00:16:35,513 --> 00:16:37,849
Oh my God.

308
00:16:39,387 --> 00:16:42,692
Do you want to really freak them out?

309
00:16:42,726 --> 00:16:44,161
Yeah.

310
00:16:44,195 --> 00:16:46,190
Who's gonna talk in there?

311
00:16:48,236 --> 00:16:49,364
- Oh my God!
- Troy!

312
00:16:49,405 --> 00:16:50,966
- Lucy!
- Isabelle!

313
00:16:51,007 --> 00:16:53,777
lsabelle! Come here,
Isabelle. Okay, we have to go.

314
00:16:53,813 --> 00:16:55,682
- Isabelle!
- Troy!

315
00:16:55,717 --> 00:16:58,816
- l think that worked.
- Yeah, l think so.

316
00:16:58,855 --> 00:17:02,525
- Um, well, it was nice meeting you.
- Yeah.

317
00:17:02,562 --> 00:17:05,058
lt's okay, yeah. We're gonna go.

318
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,231
- It's all right.
- Lucy?

319
00:17:07,271 --> 00:17:09,174
We're gonna go home.

320
00:17:09,207 --> 00:17:11,680
Okay, here we go, good girl.

321
00:17:11,712 --> 00:17:13,546
Good girl.

322
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:18,415
l'm sure your daughter
found that very educational.

323
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:19,928
His name is Brad. He's a lawyer

324
00:17:19,961 --> 00:17:22,662
and he's really very nice.

325
00:17:26,506 --> 00:17:28,740
For the past few days
Sarah hadn't been able

326
00:17:28,777 --> 00:17:31,410
to concentrate on
anything but the prom king

327
00:17:31,448 --> 00:17:33,511
and the curious thing that had happened

328
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:35,490
between them on the playground.

329
00:17:36,925 --> 00:17:39,592
She didn't feel shame or guilt,

330
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:43,164
only a sense of profound disorientation,

331
00:17:43,204 --> 00:17:45,438
as if she had been kidnapped by aliens

332
00:17:45,474 --> 00:17:48,847
then released unharmed
a few hours later.

333
00:18:05,478 --> 00:18:07,780
As he had so often in recent days,

334
00:18:07,815 --> 00:18:11,622
Brad mentally reenacted
the kiss by the swing set.

335
00:18:11,655 --> 00:18:14,128
He still couldn't believe
it had really happened.

336
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,893
And with all those women
and children watching.

337
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:17,229
Troy! Troy!

338
00:18:17,266 --> 00:18:20,332
Aaron had been particularly
curious about what he'd seen.

339
00:18:20,372 --> 00:18:22,172
Why you hugging that lady?

340
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:24,442
Well, that's what l'm
trying to show you with Bozo.

341
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:28,252
Sometimes it's a game that adults
play to show that they're friends.

342
00:18:28,286 --> 00:18:30,623
You say, "Hi, l'm your friend."

343
00:18:30,657 --> 00:18:32,058
Aaron was skeptical.

344
00:18:32,093 --> 00:18:34,794
They returned to the playground
the following morning,

345
00:18:34,831 --> 00:18:37,670
but no one was there.

346
00:18:37,703 --> 00:18:40,337
Sarah hadn't shown up
at the town pool either,

347
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:42,471
though Brad remembered
telling her that he and Aaron

348
00:18:42,512 --> 00:18:45,008
could be found there most afternoons.

349
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:48,150
lt didn't seem to matter
that Sarah wasn't his type,

350
00:18:48,189 --> 00:18:52,257
wasn't even that prem
- at least not compared to Hathy,

351
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:56,901
who had long legs and lustrous hair

352
00:18:56,939 --> 00:18:59,173
and perfect breasts.

353
00:18:59,209 --> 00:19:02,777
Sarah was short, boyish,

354
00:19:02,816 --> 00:19:05,756
and had eyebrows that were thicker
than Brad thought necessary.

355
00:19:07,524 --> 00:19:11,866
But even so, she'd walked
into his arms that day

356
00:19:11,899 --> 00:19:14,134
as if she were fulfilling a secret wish

357
00:19:14,171 --> 00:19:18,012
he hadn't remembered making.

358
00:19:18,044 --> 00:19:20,038
Hey, pervert!

359
00:19:20,081 --> 00:19:22,110
Yeah, you, you pervert!

360
00:19:22,151 --> 00:19:24,681
You like little boys, do you?

361
00:19:24,723 --> 00:19:27,322
- Larry?
- Yes, it's fucking Larry!

362
00:19:27,361 --> 00:19:29,161
Jesus, man, don't even joke about that.

363
00:19:29,198 --> 00:19:30,999
What are you doing? Are you busy?

364
00:19:31,035 --> 00:19:35,377
Uh, actually l'm
supposed to be studying.

365
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:37,780
Taking the bar exam next month.

366
00:19:37,813 --> 00:19:40,150
l thought you did that last year.

367
00:19:40,184 --> 00:19:43,023
Yeah. See how well l did?

368
00:19:43,057 --> 00:19:47,365
l got a better idea. Get in.

369
00:19:47,398 --> 00:19:50,201
Come on. Come on, COMe On,
COMe On, COMe On, COMe On.

370
00:19:52,374 --> 00:19:55,280
Do you mind holding these?
Try to keep them nice.

371
00:19:55,312 --> 00:19:58,184
Oh, uh...

372
00:19:58,217 --> 00:20:02,355
are you, uh, part of the committee?

373
00:20:03,861 --> 00:20:05,765
l am the committee.

374
00:20:07,434 --> 00:20:10,135
Wow.

375
00:20:10,172 --> 00:20:12,111
That's
- that's quite a commitment.

376
00:20:12,143 --> 00:20:14,776
Yeah.

377
00:20:14,815 --> 00:20:17,083
Aren't you full time
on the force already?

378
00:20:19,389 --> 00:20:21,795
Yeah, l'm
- l'm taking a little time off.

379
00:20:26,637 --> 00:20:30,272
You know what they
should do to this bastard?

380
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:32,783
Just castrate him. You know, pM!

381
00:20:32,815 --> 00:20:36,485
Get it over with, right?

382
00:20:36,522 --> 00:20:37,889
Yeah.

383
00:20:47,542 --> 00:20:48,944
You look good.

384
00:20:50,947 --> 00:20:54,151
You've been, uh, working out?

385
00:20:54,187 --> 00:20:57,789
Uh, just push-ups, crunches...

386
00:20:57,827 --> 00:20:59,422
a little light running.

387
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:04,163
The guys are gonna love this.

388
00:21:06,309 --> 00:21:07,711
What guys?

389
00:21:09,716 --> 00:21:13,089
Wow, this is something.

390
00:21:13,122 --> 00:21:16,119
Yeah, it's prem, but
doesn't have a lot of give.

391
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,596
lt's like playing on cement.

392
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:19,534
Hey, hold on a second.

393
00:21:19,567 --> 00:21:21,835
Duane, l've really gotta talk
to you about the committee.

394
00:21:21,871 --> 00:21:24,105
l mean, it would mean a lot to
have your support on this thing.

395
00:21:24,142 --> 00:21:27,413
l told you already, Larry, none of us
are gonna get involved in that shit.

396
00:21:27,448 --> 00:21:30,947
We're here to play ball. If that's your
thing, fine, but leave us out of it.

397
00:21:30,988 --> 00:21:33,187
Okay okay, fine. l get it,
l get it, l get it. Guys!

398
00:21:33,226 --> 00:21:36,257
Bring it in!

399
00:21:36,297 --> 00:21:39,295
Come on, come on, hustle up!

400
00:21:39,336 --> 00:21:43,075
l want you all to meet
our new quarterback.

401
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:46,084
- Quarterback?
- Guy better not be a pussy.

402
00:21:46,115 --> 00:21:47,642
He played in college.

403
00:21:47,685 --> 00:21:49,680
Uh, l'm a little behind the curve.

404
00:21:49,722 --> 00:21:51,591
Who are you guys?

405
00:21:51,626 --> 00:21:53,460
- We're the Guardians!
- We're cops.

406
00:21:53,496 --> 00:21:55,434
Welcome to the Tri-County
touch football night league.

407
00:21:55,467 --> 00:21:58,373
Let's just work on some
simple pass patterns.

408
00:22:00,876 --> 00:22:03,578
Brad waited for his
good sense to kick in.

409
00:22:03,615 --> 00:22:06,714
There were lots of
excuses available to him.

410
00:22:06,753 --> 00:22:10,423
But it felt so good to be standing
here beneath the bright lights.

411
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:12,956
And he was filled with a
feeling similar to the one

412
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:15,164
he'd had right before kissing Sarah,

413
00:22:15,203 --> 00:22:17,197
like his world had cracked open

414
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:20,613
to reveal a thrilling new possibility.

415
00:22:21,981 --> 00:22:25,047
Okay, just let me warm up a little.

416
00:22:25,087 --> 00:22:27,252
All right! Let's go!

417
00:22:27,291 --> 00:22:29,924
Set, hut!

418
00:22:35,473 --> 00:22:37,171
What the fuck?

419
00:22:37,209 --> 00:22:38,941
That's a late hit!

420
00:22:38,979 --> 00:22:40,917
This ain't Pop Warner, ace.

421
00:22:43,087 --> 00:22:47,532
You fucking faggot. You
call yourself a quarterback?

422
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:01,645
Oh, this isn't me.

423
00:23:04,293 --> 00:23:06,595
What are you doing?

424
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:08,260
What is that? What's that for?

425
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:12,837
l want the scumbag to know
l'm keeping an eye on him.

426
00:23:18,385 --> 00:23:21,656
Oh, shit. Oh, uh...

427
00:23:21,691 --> 00:23:24,688
l don't think we want to be here, Larry.

428
00:23:24,729 --> 00:23:27,728
lt's not a question of want.

429
00:23:31,409 --> 00:23:33,643
Joanie thinks l'm
obsessed with this creep.

430
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,948
She thinks if l had a job, l
wouldn't be driving past his house

431
00:23:35,984 --> 00:23:39,391
five, six times a
day. But you know what?

432
00:23:39,423 --> 00:23:42,660
l kinda think this is my job.

433
00:23:45,168 --> 00:23:48,006
There's a roll of duct tape
in the glove compartment.

434
00:23:48,039 --> 00:23:51,482
Would you grab it for me?

435
00:23:58,993 --> 00:24:01,398
Honey?

436
00:24:04,069 --> 00:24:07,202
Hi!

437
00:24:07,241 --> 00:24:09,908
Where were you?

438
00:24:12,183 --> 00:24:13,984
Oh my God. What happened?

439
00:24:14,021 --> 00:24:16,516
l- l- l joined
this group.

440
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:18,723
The Committee for Concerned Parents.

441
00:24:18,763 --> 00:24:21,760
We're distributing flyers about
that creep on Woodward Court.

442
00:24:21,801 --> 00:24:24,434
These guys play a little
touch football after.

443
00:24:26,142 --> 00:24:27,704
This late?

444
00:24:27,746 --> 00:24:30,686
Uh, it's a night league.

445
00:24:30,717 --> 00:24:34,387
So it's gonna be a regular thing?

446
00:24:34,424 --> 00:24:36,156
No no no no, just once a week,

447
00:24:36,195 --> 00:24:39,328
after l'm done studying at the library.

448
00:24:39,366 --> 00:24:41,100
ls that okay?

449
00:24:41,137 --> 00:24:44,077
Uh, who are the guys?

450
00:24:44,109 --> 00:24:46,206
You remember Larry Hedges?

451
00:24:46,246 --> 00:24:48,241
The guy from the Sprinkler
Park with the twins?

452
00:24:48,284 --> 00:24:51,521
lt's his organization.

453
00:24:51,556 --> 00:24:53,619
l thought you didn't like him.

454
00:24:55,396 --> 00:24:57,460
He's okay.

455
00:24:57,501 --> 00:25:00,772
This committee makes a
Iot of sense. l mean it's-

456
00:25:00,807 --> 00:25:03,041
it's prem scary having
a weirdo like that

457
00:25:03,077 --> 00:25:05,311
living right by the playground.

458
00:25:07,485 --> 00:25:10,688
Mmm. l know.

459
00:25:10,724 --> 00:25:12,662
l hate to even think about it.

460
00:25:15,834 --> 00:25:18,239
Guess you'd better take a shower.

461
00:25:18,272 --> 00:25:21,178
Brad showered quickly,
sensing a rare opportunity

462
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:24,310
to have sex with his wife.

463
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:26,481
"This is just what l need," he thought.

464
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:29,689
"Something to take my
mind off that kiss."

465
00:25:29,726 --> 00:25:31,891
Please don't.

466
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:33,662
Come on, Hathy, we've
been through this before.

467
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,295
He needs to start sleeping by himself.

468
00:25:35,336 --> 00:25:37,204
l know. He looks so com_.

469
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,972
Well, he'll be just
as com_ in his own bed.

470
00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:41,414
l just miss him so much.

471
00:25:41,447 --> 00:25:44,547
l'm getting a little tired waking
up with his foot in my face.

472
00:25:44,587 --> 00:25:47,220
lt's a perfect foot.

473
00:25:47,258 --> 00:25:49,993
Look at him. Just look at him.

474
00:25:51,332 --> 00:25:52,768
He's a handsome devil.

475
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:56,244
Mmm, he's perfect.

476
00:26:09,832 --> 00:26:11,394
Good night.

477
00:26:16,111 --> 00:26:17,741
Number 2 Hillcrest

478
00:26:17,781 --> 00:26:19,912
was an impressive piece of real estate.

479
00:26:19,952 --> 00:26:22,151
Even so, Sarah was ambivalent

480
00:26:22,189 --> 00:26:24,423
about the house she occupied.

481
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:27,663
She wasn't involved with
its purchase or design.

482
00:26:27,699 --> 00:26:30,640
The place was a hand-me-down
of sorts from Richard's mother.

483
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:34,273
And the furnishings were
leftovers from his first marriage.

484
00:26:34,311 --> 00:26:36,249
By the time Sarah arrived here

485
00:26:36,282 --> 00:26:38,847
Richard wasn't all that
interested in redecorating.

486
00:26:38,886 --> 00:26:41,952
And so she decided
to leave it as it was,

487
00:26:41,992 --> 00:26:45,867
with the exception of a single
room that she staked out for her own

488
00:26:45,899 --> 00:26:47,871
and gradually began to populate it

489
00:26:47,902 --> 00:26:50,137
with the remnants of her former self.

490
00:26:55,984 --> 00:26:57,956
From the moment Lucy was born

491
00:26:57,988 --> 00:27:00,962
Sarah had refused to hire
someone for child care.

492
00:27:00,993 --> 00:27:03,364
Read me a story?

493
00:27:03,398 --> 00:27:06,167
ln a minute, okay?

494
00:27:06,203 --> 00:27:08,802
- Can l sit on your lap?
- l said in a minute!

495
00:27:08,842 --> 00:27:11,007
Go finish your program, go.

496
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:14,077
She wasn't exactly sure why
she had taken this stance.

497
00:27:14,117 --> 00:27:17,388
The truth was she spent
most afternoons marking time,

498
00:27:17,423 --> 00:27:21,161
waiting desperately for the moment
when her husband returned from work

499
00:27:21,197 --> 00:27:24,000
and she could finally
have a moment to herself.

500
00:27:24,036 --> 00:27:26,200
But even this was not
something she could rely on.

501
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,800
You're ready to roll?

502
00:27:27,843 --> 00:27:29,780
Could you wait a few minutes?

503
00:27:29,813 --> 00:27:32,252
l'm sorry, Richard's barricaded
in the upstairs office

504
00:27:32,285 --> 00:27:35,191
- finishing some stuff for work.
- No problem.

505
00:27:35,223 --> 00:27:37,354
l've got a little surprise
for someone anyway.

506
00:27:37,394 --> 00:27:39,798
She's a terror at night. l
couldn't get her to nap again.

507
00:27:39,832 --> 00:27:42,897
- Oh, the poor thing.
- Poor mom is more like it.

508
00:27:42,937 --> 00:27:45,000
Hello.

509
00:27:45,041 --> 00:27:47,981
ls there a cute little
girl in the house?

510
00:27:48,013 --> 00:27:50,646
Oh, my goodness!

511
00:27:50,684 --> 00:27:53,454
What-

512
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:55,928
what have l found?

513
00:27:55,961 --> 00:27:58,594
- A beanie.
- Oh, a beanie.

514
00:27:58,633 --> 00:28:00,126
Jean, you didn't need to to that.

515
00:28:00,169 --> 00:28:04,044
Oh, this little dog needed
a girl to take care of him.

516
00:28:04,076 --> 00:28:06,879
And l know a little
girl who needed a dog.

517
00:28:08,985 --> 00:28:10,957
Let me see.

518
00:28:10,989 --> 00:28:12,721
Sarah was beginning to get angry.

519
00:28:12,758 --> 00:28:15,324
Her evening fitness
walk was the one thing

520
00:28:15,364 --> 00:28:18,601
she looked forward to all
day, and Richard knew this.

521
00:28:21,441 --> 00:28:23,675
But if there was one thing
life had taught Richard,

522
00:28:23,712 --> 00:28:25,650
it was that it was ridiculous

523
00:28:25,683 --> 00:28:28,816
to be at war with your own desires.

524
00:28:28,854 --> 00:28:32,456
He could easily imagine what people
would say if they could see him now-

525
00:28:32,495 --> 00:28:35,401
Exactly the same thing they'd
say if someone had told them

526
00:28:35,434 --> 00:28:39,001
that Ray from next
door was a transvestite,

527
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,840
or that Ted from work

528
00:28:40,877 --> 00:28:43,543
had anonymous gay sex
at highway rest stops.

529
00:28:43,581 --> 00:28:46,921
"But we want what we
want," Richard thought,

530
00:28:46,955 --> 00:28:49,017
"and there's not much
we can do about it."

531
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:53,532
He had stumbled on
the site 11 months ago

532
00:28:53,567 --> 00:28:56,507
while doing research
for a consulting firm.

533
00:28:56,539 --> 00:28:59,206
His office door was wide open.

534
00:28:59,244 --> 00:29:01,341
But he clicked on the link anyway.

535
00:29:09,463 --> 00:29:11,662
He was deeply engrossed in his discovery

536
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:14,230
when Ted knocked on his door.

537
00:29:14,272 --> 00:29:16,072
l'm taking lunch orders.
You want something?

538
00:29:16,108 --> 00:29:18,080
Casually, but with great haste

539
00:29:18,112 --> 00:29:21,143
Richard banished Slum
Hay from his screen...

540
00:29:21,183 --> 00:29:23,384
Uh, yeah, l'll have a chicken Caesar.

541
00:29:23,422 --> 00:29:26,829
...and reentered the
flow of an ordinary day.

542
00:29:29,232 --> 00:29:31,705
lt wasn't until several months later

543
00:29:31,737 --> 00:29:35,110
that Richard gave the slightest thought
to the site he had stumbled upon.

544
00:29:37,848 --> 00:29:39,716
Do you need me for anything else?

545
00:29:39,752 --> 00:29:41,723
Uh, no no, you can head home.

546
00:29:41,755 --> 00:29:43,419
l'm just gonna catch up on some e-mail.

547
00:29:43,458 --> 00:29:46,490
Well, don't stay to late.
Your dinner will get cold.

548
00:29:54,679 --> 00:29:58,885
Lately Slum Hay had become a problem.

549
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,948
He thought about her far to often,

550
00:30:00,991 --> 00:30:02,324
and spent hours studying

551
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:05,460
the thousands of
photographs available to him.

552
00:30:05,499 --> 00:30:08,371
Some of Hay's practices
struck him as bizarre,

553
00:30:08,404 --> 00:30:10,342
even off-putting.

554
00:30:10,375 --> 00:30:13,873
She had a thing about kitchen utensils,

555
00:30:13,914 --> 00:30:16,251
spatulas, and dressing
up like a little girl

556
00:30:16,285 --> 00:30:17,984
and playing with balloons.

557
00:30:18,022 --> 00:30:20,928
But who was Richard to judge?

558
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,263
Oh, that's it.

559
00:30:26,303 --> 00:30:30,042
Though as close as Richard
sometimes felt to Slum Hay,

560
00:30:30,077 --> 00:30:32,345
as much as he believed that he knew her,

561
00:30:32,381 --> 00:30:35,116
he could never get past
the uncomfortable fact

562
00:30:35,153 --> 00:30:39,325
that she existed for him
solely as a digital image.

563
00:30:49,345 --> 00:30:51,819
The panties were an attempt
to solve this problem.

564
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:55,885
Maybe a sniff or two
would hurry things along,

565
00:30:55,924 --> 00:30:58,523
so he could get back
downstairs to his real life,

566
00:30:58,562 --> 00:31:00,558
where his wife was waiting for him

567
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:03,803
her impatience increasing by the minute.

568
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:06,813
What are you doing?

569
00:31:59,708 --> 00:32:03,709
Are you almost finished there? 'Cause
l'd really like to go for my walk?

570
00:32:05,419 --> 00:32:08,758
- You could have knocked.
- l did!

571
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:13,030
We need to talk.

572
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:25,814
You're awfully quiet this evening.

573
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:29,127
- Everything okay?
- What?

574
00:32:29,162 --> 00:32:31,465
Yeah.

575
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,631
You'll have to walk
without me tomorrow night.

576
00:32:33,671 --> 00:32:36,143
l've got a book group meeting.

577
00:32:36,175 --> 00:32:38,204
Okay.

578
00:32:38,245 --> 00:32:40,548
You're sure everything's all right?

579
00:32:41,585 --> 00:32:44,388
Yeah, sorry.

580
00:32:44,423 --> 00:32:47,888
l guess l'm just a little tired.

581
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:49,662
So what are you reading?

582
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,534
"Crime and Punishment."

583
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:54,807
Wow. That's prem
highbrow for a book group.

584
00:32:54,843 --> 00:32:58,580
Well, we have some very
stimulating discussions.

585
00:32:58,616 --> 00:33:01,215
You should come next month.
We're doing "Madame Bovary."

586
00:33:01,254 --> 00:33:03,385
You could be my little sister.

587
00:33:03,425 --> 00:33:04,986
Little sister?

588
00:33:05,028 --> 00:33:08,698
We're trying to get
younger women involved.

589
00:33:08,735 --> 00:33:10,603
We call them our little sisters.

590
00:33:12,074 --> 00:33:14,513
l don't know, Jean.

591
00:33:14,546 --> 00:33:17,144
l read "Madame Bovary" in grad school.

592
00:33:17,184 --> 00:33:19,679
lt's a prem misogynist text.

593
00:33:19,722 --> 00:33:22,856
Well, that's an interesting perspective.

594
00:33:22,894 --> 00:33:25,697
- You should come.
- Let me think about it.

595
00:33:25,733 --> 00:33:28,731
Oh, would you excuse me, Jean?

596
00:33:28,772 --> 00:33:32,214
Someone's at my door.
l'll call you, okay?

597
00:33:32,245 --> 00:33:34,114
Hi!

598
00:33:37,555 --> 00:33:39,150
Hi!

599
00:33:42,597 --> 00:33:45,298
Wow, God,

600
00:33:45,335 --> 00:33:46,805
this is a surprise.

601
00:33:46,838 --> 00:33:48,867
l haven't seen you since-

602
00:33:48,909 --> 00:33:51,473
l
- l hope you don't mind. Your husband said you'd be back any minute.

603
00:33:51,514 --> 00:33:53,108
Oh, no, not at all.

604
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:55,486
lt's good to see you.

605
00:33:55,521 --> 00:33:59,328
God, um, can l get you
some tea or something?

606
00:33:59,361 --> 00:34:01,799
l can only stay a minute.
l just came to warn you.

607
00:34:01,832 --> 00:34:04,499
- You know that guy,
the pervert? - Uh-huh.

608
00:34:04,537 --> 00:34:06,098
He's been riding his
bike near the playground

609
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:08,670
- checking out the kids.
- Oh, God.

610
00:34:08,711 --> 00:34:11,379
Oh, God, do the police know?

611
00:34:11,417 --> 00:34:13,412
Nothing they can do. He's
not breaking any laws.

612
00:34:13,454 --> 00:34:16,827
l guess they're just waiting
for him to kill someone.

613
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:19,128
l just thought you should know.

614
00:34:19,164 --> 00:34:22,766
Thanks, that's nice of you.

615
00:34:22,804 --> 00:34:25,106
Let me get you some tea.

616
00:34:25,142 --> 00:34:28,880
l'm sorry. l
- l don't think it's a good idea.

617
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:33,722
l didn't mean to kiss him.

618
00:34:33,757 --> 00:34:36,995
l don't even know how it happened.

619
00:34:40,604 --> 00:34:43,578
l'd better go. Mike's gonna worry.

620
00:34:49,152 --> 00:34:51,557
You wanna talk?

621
00:34:51,591 --> 00:34:53,425
l'm tired.

622
00:36:27,199 --> 00:36:29,638
Hello.

623
00:36:29,671 --> 00:36:32,075
Hey.

624
00:36:32,108 --> 00:36:35,744
No, he's still sleeping.

625
00:36:35,782 --> 00:36:39,019
Yeah, l'm, uh, l'm going
through it right now.

626
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:45,793
No, l guess l don't need them.

627
00:36:49,105 --> 00:36:50,440
Okay.

628
00:36:51,877 --> 00:36:55,148
All right, bye.

629
00:37:59,201 --> 00:38:00,569
H-hi.

630
00:38:00,604 --> 00:38:02,906
H-hello?

631
00:38:02,942 --> 00:38:06,213
Yes, l'd like to place an order.

632
00:38:06,247 --> 00:38:09,587
Pierce, Sarah, Mrs.

633
00:38:11,624 --> 00:38:12,752
Um...

634
00:38:12,793 --> 00:38:17,101
it's the red bathing suit on page 29.

635
00:38:17,134 --> 00:38:19,402
The hide-your-tummy
halter neck.

636
00:38:21,442 --> 00:38:24,041
Uh, l'm size...

637
00:38:26,485 --> 00:38:30,292
10, eight? l mean, l think.

638
00:38:30,325 --> 00:38:32,422
E-eight.

639
00:39:14,473 --> 00:39:16,171
You want to go in the pool?

640
00:39:16,209 --> 00:39:17,839
You do?

641
00:39:20,951 --> 00:39:24,324
One, two.

642
00:39:30,202 --> 00:39:33,199
Daddy, can l go in the pool now?

643
00:39:33,241 --> 00:39:35,178
ln a minute, okay?

644
00:39:35,211 --> 00:39:38,380
Okay.

645
00:39:38,416 --> 00:39:41,289
There you go.

646
00:39:48,602 --> 00:39:51,166
Mommy, l have to go pee-pee.

647
00:39:51,207 --> 00:39:53,509
Just go in the pool.

648
00:39:53,545 --> 00:39:56,952
Huh-uh, l want to go to the bathroom.

649
00:39:56,984 --> 00:39:58,922
Really?

650
00:39:58,954 --> 00:40:00,858
Okay, come on.

651
00:40:05,533 --> 00:40:07,128
Okay, ready?

652
00:40:07,170 --> 00:40:09,301
There.

653
00:40:38,293 --> 00:40:40,424
Swing down.

654
00:40:43,402 --> 00:40:46,434
Hey, l'm drumming it.

655
00:40:46,475 --> 00:40:47,705
Oh.

656
00:40:48,712 --> 00:40:51,687
Wow.

657
00:40:51,718 --> 00:40:54,282
- It's you.
- Yeah, hey.

658
00:40:54,322 --> 00:40:57,091
- Hi!
- Okay.

659
00:40:58,497 --> 00:41:00,970
l hope you don't mind.
Lucy has sensitive skin.

660
00:41:01,002 --> 00:41:03,668
She's better off in the shade.

661
00:41:03,707 --> 00:41:06,442
Oh no, not at all.

662
00:41:06,478 --> 00:41:07,709
lt's nice to see you again.

663
00:41:07,747 --> 00:41:09,776
Yeah, you too.

664
00:41:12,389 --> 00:41:14,828
l'm sorry, would you get my back?

665
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:17,994
Um... okay, sure.

666
00:41:18,033 --> 00:41:19,400
Thanks.

667
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:20,996
Right.

668
00:41:21,038 --> 00:41:24,070
# Who is knocking on the door? #

669
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:25,638
- Thanks a lot.
- # Hnocking on the door #

670
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,777
# Hnocking on the door #

671
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:30,553
- # Who is knocking on the door? #
- It's okay, just...

672
00:41:30,589 --> 00:41:33,061
# A way, hey hey. #

673
00:41:33,093 --> 00:41:35,224
Lucy, say hi to the little
boy from the playground.

674
00:41:35,264 --> 00:41:39,139
Hi.

675
00:41:39,172 --> 00:41:41,440
You remember him?

676
00:41:46,685 --> 00:41:48,714
The pool became a ritual.

677
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:51,457
l was trying to think. l
just didn't know the way.

678
00:41:51,494 --> 00:41:53,295
- Oh oh, okay.
- l'm here, l'm here.

679
00:41:53,331 --> 00:41:55,029
We have the creature and we have flower.

680
00:41:55,067 --> 00:41:56,264
Right.

681
00:41:56,303 --> 00:41:58,799
Day after day they sat
together in the shade

682
00:41:58,841 --> 00:42:00,835
getting to know each other.

683
00:42:01,946 --> 00:42:04,785
This needs mustard.

684
00:42:04,819 --> 00:42:07,087
- Mustard?
- Yeah.

685
00:42:07,123 --> 00:42:09,026
Having little choice in the matter,

686
00:42:09,059 --> 00:42:10,894
Aaron and Lucy formed
a fragile friendship.

687
00:42:17,174 --> 00:42:19,169
Aw, that's perfect.

688
00:42:19,211 --> 00:42:22,153
Sometimes Brad and
Sarah traded offspring.

689
00:42:26,224 --> 00:42:28,356
Mama said, "What Papa
told you was right.

690
00:42:28,395 --> 00:42:31,461
lt's not a good idea
to talk to strangers."

691
00:42:31,501 --> 00:42:35,467
lt was the most fun
Sarah had had in years.

692
00:42:49,033 --> 00:42:52,064
But there was always
that longing to touch,

693
00:42:52,105 --> 00:42:55,639
to be touched by Brad.

694
00:42:55,678 --> 00:42:59,213
And, as badly as she wanted this,

695
00:42:59,252 --> 00:43:02,716
she wanted just as badly to hold
on to the innocent public life

696
00:43:02,758 --> 00:43:05,288
they'd made for
themselves out in the open.

697
00:43:05,330 --> 00:43:07,963
So she accepted the trade-

698
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:11,101
the melancholy handshake at 4:OO

699
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:14,240
in exchange for this
little patch of grass,

700
00:43:14,279 --> 00:43:16,912
tOMe tUntcreen and companionship.

701
00:43:16,951 --> 00:43:20,449
One more happy day at the pool.

702
00:43:22,161 --> 00:43:24,896
Okay, no pasta for dinner, okay?

703
00:43:24,933 --> 00:43:27,303
We eat way too much pasta around here.

704
00:43:27,336 --> 00:43:29,366
l thought you liked my pasta.

705
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:31,972
No, l do. That's the problem.

706
00:43:32,012 --> 00:43:34,986
Prem soon l can sell
advertising space on my ass.

707
00:43:36,219 --> 00:43:37,746
No, that's okay. l've got to go.

708
00:43:37,789 --> 00:43:39,761
l've got a 9:OO at Taps.

709
00:43:39,793 --> 00:43:41,856
l thought you were already editing.

710
00:43:41,897 --> 00:43:44,803
Yeah, so did l. It was just-

711
00:43:44,835 --> 00:43:48,369
there's something in this family's
story that really got to me.

712
00:43:51,047 --> 00:43:53,281
The father was...

713
00:43:53,318 --> 00:43:56,258

H-l-L-L-E-D

714
00:43:56,289 --> 00:43:59,697
in a, um, mortar attack,

715
00:43:59,730 --> 00:44:02,636
and, um, left behind a little boy.

716
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:07,735
l was talking to the mother
the other day on the phone,

717
00:44:07,777 --> 00:44:11,550
and she was saying she didn't know
what she was going to do next Christmas.

718
00:44:11,584 --> 00:44:12,884
Jeez, l bet.

719
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:15,450
No, it wasn't like that. It was more...

720
00:44:15,491 --> 00:44:18,466
she was wondering, should she
keep this tradition with her son

721
00:44:18,497 --> 00:44:20,195
that began with the boy's father.

722
00:44:20,234 --> 00:44:23,037
And she was saying he had this knack

723
00:44:23,072 --> 00:44:25,807
for requesting odd Christmas gifts-

724
00:44:25,843 --> 00:44:27,782
scuba gear one year

725
00:44:27,814 --> 00:44:30,447
and rappelling gear the next.

726
00:44:30,486 --> 00:44:34,486
She said he wasn't
afraid to try anything.

727
00:44:34,526 --> 00:44:37,159
Trying new things made him feel...

728
00:44:37,198 --> 00:44:40,196
more alive.

729
00:44:42,174 --> 00:44:45,479
l've got to go. See you later.

730
00:44:54,363 --> 00:44:57,497
Patch one of your best and
then we'll patch both of them.

731
00:44:57,536 --> 00:44:59,473
Okay?

732
00:45:02,211 --> 00:45:04,650
Hey, l got something.

733
00:45:09,023 --> 00:45:11,519
Hot enough for you?

734
00:45:11,561 --> 00:45:14,194
Yeah.

735
00:45:14,233 --> 00:45:17,333
Yeah, it's so humid.

736
00:45:17,372 --> 00:45:20,870
l've got football practice tonight.

737
00:45:20,912 --> 00:45:22,883
Be like playing in a sauna.

738
00:45:22,915 --> 00:45:26,254
Watch out for that Italian guy.

739
00:45:26,288 --> 00:45:28,887
What's his name?

740
00:45:28,926 --> 00:45:30,328
Corrente?

741
00:45:30,363 --> 00:45:33,098
Yeah.

742
00:45:33,134 --> 00:45:35,572
Remember what happened
to your knee last week?

743
00:45:35,605 --> 00:45:38,101
You should be careful, Brad.

744
00:45:40,882 --> 00:45:42,614
l'll be careful.

745
00:45:42,651 --> 00:45:45,250
Promise?

746
00:45:47,593 --> 00:45:51,367
Yeah. Yeah, l promise.

747
00:45:54,506 --> 00:45:56,980
Weatherman said scattered showers.

748
00:45:57,011 --> 00:45:59,006
l don't see scattered showers.

749
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:11,972
Mom, could l please have
some money for a snack?

750
00:46:12,005 --> 00:46:14,604
No, sweetheart. You guys
just had a snack. No.

751
00:46:14,643 --> 00:46:16,114
Oh, okay.

752
00:46:16,146 --> 00:46:18,118
All they want is sugar.

753
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:19,951
Constantly.

754
00:47:37,897 --> 00:47:39,892
Oh, no.

755
00:47:47,014 --> 00:47:49,612
lt's him.

756
00:47:50,753 --> 00:47:52,748
Oh, Jesus.

757
00:48:00,271 --> 00:48:02,368
Oh my God, it's him.

758
00:48:02,408 --> 00:48:05,041
He's in the pool.

759
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:07,211
Oh my God!

760
00:48:07,250 --> 00:48:09,348
Jacob, get out of the pool now!

761
00:48:09,388 --> 00:48:11,416
Oh my God. That's him.

762
00:48:11,458 --> 00:48:15,425
- Get away from that man.
- Why is everybody running to the pool?

763
00:48:15,466 --> 00:48:17,460
Brooke? Jake?

764
00:48:17,503 --> 00:48:20,238
Dale, you'd better get over here.

765
00:48:24,348 --> 00:48:25,784
Get out of the pool!

766
00:48:35,603 --> 00:48:38,475
Where's your sister?

767
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:50,860
Why'd we have to get out, Mom?

768
00:48:50,897 --> 00:48:53,700
l'm scared.

769
00:48:59,046 --> 00:49:02,145
- What did he do?
- What's going on?

770
00:49:17,713 --> 00:49:20,380
l'm scared.

771
00:49:25,795 --> 00:49:28,564
Um, why the police is here?

772
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:32,338
Um, there's a man over there who
doesn't have a ticket to get in,
