Ah, let me have the straight one then.

21
00:03:03,889 --> 00:03:06,181
See, this is the part where for me
it started looking like a problem.

22
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:10,556
I mean, l wanted to sacrifice the precentral
vein in order to get some exposure.

23
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:14,024
But because of this guy's normal variation,
l got excited and all the sudden I didn't know

24
00:03:14,151 --> 00:03:17,770
whether I was looking at the precentral vein or one
of the internal cerebro veins or the Vein of Galen

25
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:21,985
or the Basilar vein of Rosenthal, so one my own me at
this point l was ready to say ''That's it, let's get out''.

26
00:03:22,116 --> 00:03:25,203
See, you can check
your anatomy all you want,

27
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:28,000
and even though there may be normal
variation, if you get right down to it,

28
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:30,960
this far inside the head,
it all looks the same.

29
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:34,169
No, no, no. Don't tug on that.
You never know what it might be attached to.

No, not from the jet car.

00:27:33,317 --> 00:27:36,269
Third cell to the left. Pink dress.

294
00:27:36,403 --> 00:27:38,028
<i>Arigato.</i>

295
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:54,248
What do you want? Huh?
What are you doin' here?

296
00:27:54,383 --> 00:27:57,633
What are you doing here?

297
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:00,632
Why don't you just go away
and let me rot?

298
00:28:03,221 --> 00:28:06,557
Who were you really trying
to annihilate last night?

299
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:11,305
You. Just like the papers all say.

300
00:28:13,902 --> 00:28:16,025
Come over here.

301
00:28:17,614 --> 00:28:20,188
Come on.

302
00:28:20,325 --> 00:28:24,615
<i>Oh, my God! Perfect Tommy!</i>

303
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:31,701
What do you want from me?

304
00:28:34,006 --> 00:28:38,663
Oh, you remind me of someone
l once knew long ago.

305
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:45,220
Was she very beautiful?

306
00:28:46,768 --> 00:28:50,813
She was... queen of the Netherlands.

307
00:28:50,939 --> 00:28:53,346
That's a long way
from where l come from.

308
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:56,980
Wyoming? Cody, Wyoming?

309
00:28:57,942 --> 00:29:00,817
No, l'm from Laramie.

310
00:29:00,949 --> 00:29:03,817
Except that l was born in Cody,
but nobody...

311
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:07,153
<i>Do you have family?</i>
<i>Back in Cody, l mean?</i>

312
00:29:07,288 --> 00:29:09,490
<i>l don't know.</i>

313
00:29:09,625 --> 00:29:13,622
See, l always felt that there was
another part of me somewhere.

314
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:15,996
Another part of you?

315
00:29:16,131 --> 00:29:18,586
Somewhere, yeah.

316
00:29:19,509 --> 00:29:21,663
l'm adopted.

317
00:29:21,803 --> 00:29:23,630
Of course!

318
00:29:23,759 --> 00:29:26,930
lf it was a snake, it'd have bit me!

319
00:29:27,057 --> 00:29:29,431
- Another you.
- Anything's possible.

320
00:29:29,557 --> 00:29:32,182
- Let her out!
<i>- Hey, me too.</i>

321
00:29:32,314 --> 00:29:35,730
- Let her out?
- Yeah, let her out. l'll be responsible.

322
00:29:35,855 --> 00:29:38,979
- She's a killer!
- No, she's not. And give her your coat.

323
00:29:39,653 --> 00:29:41,612
Why me?

324
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:43,942
Because you're perfect.

325
00:29:45,911 --> 00:29:47,615
You have a point there.

326
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:55,365
l'd like to move this thing along.

327
00:29:55,500 --> 00:30:00,211
Perhaps some of you noticed we have
a motorcycle convention rolling in here.

328
00:30:00,342 --> 00:30:02,798
We're a little short of time.

329
00:30:02,928 --> 00:30:06,509
Besides, l don't imagine you
came here to listen to me talk.

330
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,711
You're right.

331
00:30:12,688 --> 00:30:16,134
Without further ado, l'd like
to introduce a young man

332
00:30:16,275 --> 00:30:21,480
who yesterday took our notions
of reality and turned them inside out.

333
00:30:21,613 --> 00:30:25,855
Dr Buckaroo Banzai,
perhaps you can explain yourself.

334
00:30:30,288 --> 00:30:31,567
Ooh.

335
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:36,583
Secretary, Senator Cunningham...
members of the world press.

336
00:30:37,045 --> 00:30:41,538
<i>30 years ago, almost to this day, my mother and</i>
<i>father, Doctors Sandra and Masado Banzai</i>

337
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:45,459
<i>gave their lives for what was then</i>
<i>considered to be a very insane notion...</i>

338
00:30:45,596 --> 00:30:50,092
<i>the possibility of contacting alien life.</i>

339
00:30:50,221 --> 00:30:54,971
<i>However, not on another planet. But here.</i>

340
00:30:55,105 --> 00:30:58,391
<i>Maybe right inside this table...</i>

341
00:30:58,525 --> 00:31:02,769
<i>living on a simultaneous plane</i>
<i>of existence with our own.</i>

342
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:05,901
Perhaps within a mountain.

343
00:31:07,826 --> 00:31:11,240
See this rock? lt's solid matter, right?

344
00:31:11,371 --> 00:31:16,278
But the solid parts of this rock - the
neutrons, quarks, protons and electrons -

345
00:31:16,413 --> 00:31:17,912
comprise only about

346
00:31:18,045 --> 00:31:20,880
one quadrillionth of its total volume.

347
00:31:21,006 --> 00:31:23,211
- How many zeros is that?
- Quite a few.

348
00:31:24,134 --> 00:31:26,708
The rest of this rock
is actually empty space.

349
00:31:26,845 --> 00:31:30,546
So, back in 1937, Professor Hikita here
and Dr Emilio Lizardo

350
00:31:30,682 --> 00:31:34,217
figured that if solid matter
were mostly just empty space,

351
00:31:34,353 --> 00:31:38,644
a person should be able to discover
a way to travel inside things.

352
00:31:38,769 --> 00:31:43,019
We at the Banzai lnstitute
have at last found that way.

353
00:31:43,153 --> 00:31:45,988
We have created a device

354
00:31:46,114 --> 00:31:49,614
called an oscillation overthruster,

355
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:53,575
which systematically reorders matter

356
00:31:53,701 --> 00:31:58,163
by annihilating electrons, positrons...

357
00:31:58,288 --> 00:32:02,076
I get it. What you're saying is that
oppositely-charged particles collide,

358
00:32:02,211 --> 00:32:07,086
and blow each other up in a burst of energy.
Like a tiny big bang, like a... baby bang.

359
00:32:09,471 --> 00:32:13,172
l'm probably just stating the very obvious.
Shut up, Penny. Shut up.

360
00:32:13,307 --> 00:32:17,353
Oh, no. lt's not obvious at all. lf it was obvious,
everybody would be doing it every day.

361
00:32:17,479 --> 00:32:21,971
See, by all accounts, it appears as though
l literally went right through a mountain.

362
00:32:22,105 --> 00:32:26,057
But you could take that mountain
and pulverise it...

363
00:32:26,192 --> 00:32:31,191
and sift through it like breadcrumbs
for the rest of your natural life...

364
00:32:31,326 --> 00:32:36,700
and you would never ever find... this.

365
00:32:37,913 --> 00:32:42,911
And yet this living organism came out
of that mountain in Texas with me.

366
00:32:43,046 --> 00:32:46,913
Even though l was never
inside that mountain.

367
00:32:47,634 --> 00:32:49,045
The president's calling.

368
00:32:49,178 --> 00:32:52,381
- The president of what?
- The president of the United States.

369
00:32:52,509 --> 00:32:54,884
Oh. Here.

370
00:32:55,017 --> 00:32:56,259
Later.

371
00:32:56,393 --> 00:33:00,557
- ls he still delirious?
- l can't tell. It's real fuzzy. I patched him
through to a payphone down the hall.

372
00:33:00,689 --> 00:33:04,817
- Do your thing.
- Buckaroo, you forgot your thruster.

373
00:33:04,942 --> 00:33:07,814
Why don't you hold onto it for a while?

374
00:33:07,942 --> 00:33:09,769
Any time.

375
00:33:09,903 --> 00:33:12,442
Do we have the first slide, please?

376
00:33:12,576 --> 00:33:15,990
What about the Pentagon?
The possibility of war

377
00:33:16,121 --> 00:33:18,612
in the Eighth Dimension, Mr Secretary?

378
00:33:18,749 --> 00:33:19,740
What?

379
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:24,576
lt seemed like a strange connection
even back at the bus.

380
00:33:27,132 --> 00:33:29,086
Mr President?

381
00:33:30,928 --> 00:33:33,298
Some kind of interference.

382
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:37,134
Hello, Mr President?

383
00:33:37,267 --> 00:33:40,432
<i>Mr President? Mr President, hello?</i>

384
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:42,721
<i>Hello, Mr President?</i>

385
00:33:43,269 --> 00:33:46,307
- What's going on?
- Maybe it's a prankster, some computer whiz kid.

386
00:33:46,442 --> 00:33:48,480
Not with Elephant Bravo.

387
00:33:48,612 --> 00:33:52,903
- Not with an alpha clearance.
- Alpha clearance? Hello? Mr...

388
00:33:53,028 --> 00:33:57,326
Ed, go back to the bus and reroute this call to
the president's suite at Walter Reed Hospital.

389
00:33:57,451 --> 00:34:02,278
Yeah, and make sure this is on the level.
We're busy people here.

390
00:34:02,413 --> 00:34:04,538
Does the President call him a lot?

391
00:34:09,257 --> 00:34:11,215
Pencil! Pen! Quick! Anything!

392
00:34:11,342 --> 00:34:13,085
Don't touch him!

393
00:34:15,054 --> 00:34:17,675
<i>What's he writing?</i>

394
00:34:17,806 --> 00:34:19,219
Conference room!

395
00:34:19,351 --> 00:34:21,344
<i>Conference room! Let's go!</i>

396
00:34:21,478 --> 00:34:23,849
Launch thermopod.

397
00:34:35,784 --> 00:34:38,072
- There they are.
<i>- Dr Banzai.</i>

398
00:34:38,202 --> 00:34:40,777
- Don't you see 'em?
- What do you mean? Who?

399
00:34:40,914 --> 00:34:45,291
Evil! Pure and simple from the
Eighth Dimension! Grab 'em!

400
00:34:45,793 --> 00:34:49,376
<i>- Lectroids! Grab 'em!</i>
<i>- Lectroids? He's got a gun.</i>

401
00:34:50,007 --> 00:34:52,960
OK, wise guy!

402
00:34:55,762 --> 00:35:00,554
Let those gun belts hit the floor!
Nobody follows or the Prof is history!

403
00:35:02,686 --> 00:35:05,722
<i>- Where's Buckaroo?</i>
<i>- Get him.</i>

404
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:09,983
<i>- Where's the overthruster?</i>
<i>- Get an ambulance.</i>

405
00:35:25,833 --> 00:35:30,329
- Come on, will you just ignore them?
- lsn't that...?

406
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:56,478
Hey, wait a minute! You can't ride that!

407
00:35:58,114 --> 00:36:00,192
lt's Buckaroo Banzai!

408
00:36:12,965 --> 00:36:13,996
- Hold it!
- Freeze!

409
00:36:35,945 --> 00:36:40,157
- l had my eyes open all day long, Burt.
- lt may not be a total loss.

410
00:36:40,284 --> 00:36:44,661
- l'm about ready to go home.
- We might see something.

411
00:36:49,376 --> 00:36:52,460
l hit it! It is wounded.

412
00:36:54,255 --> 00:36:56,664
What'd it look like to you?

413
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,967
- Like a big black flying dinosaur.
- Dinosaur? lt was purple.

414
00:37:00,094 --> 00:37:04,922
- That's what it looked like. lt was black.
- lt was purple. lt'll be dark before we even find it.

415
00:37:06,059 --> 00:37:09,309
We get Professor Hikita
to cough up the crucial missing circuit

416
00:37:09,438 --> 00:37:11,726
and then we finally get our butts off this rock!

417
00:37:11,856 --> 00:37:14,726
Oh, yeah? Listen to this!

418
00:37:15,652 --> 00:37:19,152
Well, what is it? What is it?

419
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,237
Black thermopod emergency beacon!

420
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:24,036
Here? On Earth?

421
00:37:24,161 --> 00:37:28,159
- Why? John Bigbooté, why?
- Coordinates established.

422
00:37:28,289 --> 00:37:31,291
Electromagnetic energy
back on route three.

423
00:37:49,936 --> 00:37:53,021
- The whole top of the tree's squashed!
- Do you think it up there?

424
00:37:53,148 --> 00:37:55,056
Let's wait for the cops, Burt.

425
00:37:55,192 --> 00:37:58,108
What for? Are you scared?

426
00:37:58,237 --> 00:38:01,402
- There's gotta be something there.
- Come on, Burt. There's nothing up there.

427
00:38:01,532 --> 00:38:04,983
Well, how do you know?
Here, hold this. Hold this!

428
00:38:07,329 --> 00:38:10,579
Where you going? Where you going?!

429
00:38:10,706 --> 00:38:12,746
Christmas shopping.

430
00:38:14,878 --> 00:38:18,413
- What's that?
- lt's a stick. What's it look like?

431
00:38:19,925 --> 00:38:22,250
- Gimme some light, will ya?
- l got two guns in my hands.

432
00:38:22,385 --> 00:38:25,340
- Put one of them down.
- l ain't putting the guns down!

433
00:38:25,472 --> 00:38:28,806
- lt's just a tree.
- Then leave it alone!

434
00:38:28,934 --> 00:38:32,469
Aagh! See, l told you!
l told you! Leave it alone!

435
00:38:35,565 --> 00:38:38,518
Run! Run! Run!

436
00:38:38,652 --> 00:38:43,858
- Shoot it, Bubba. Shoot it!
- l can't! lt's jammed! lt's jammed!

437
00:38:48,077 --> 00:38:51,695
There's something.
There's something coming out!

438
00:38:51,831 --> 00:38:53,739
- Where?
- Out of the top.

439
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:00,088
Oh, my soul!

440
00:39:01,884 --> 00:39:06,460
Throw me my gun, Bubba. Throw it.

441
00:39:09,181 --> 00:39:10,380
Sorry.

442
00:39:23,697 --> 00:39:24,728
ls he dead?

443
00:39:24,864 --> 00:39:27,864
Yeah, I think so. But look
at his face. It's changing.

444
00:39:27,992 --> 00:39:31,277
And his hair...
his hair is all disappeared.

445
00:39:31,413 --> 00:39:36,454
- What's that smell? You smell electricity?
- He's crackling. We're standing in water.

446
00:39:36,585 --> 00:39:37,829
What is he, Burt?
ls he radioactive?

447
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:41,876
How the hell do l know?
Do l look like a nuclear genius?

448
00:39:42,007 --> 00:39:44,213
He's probably from Mars.
Or Jupiter.

449
00:39:44,342 --> 00:39:46,715
Jupiter? I hope he's alone.

450
00:39:46,844 --> 00:39:48,967
- There's somethin' over there.
- Where?

451
00:39:49,097 --> 00:39:51,137
Right there.

452
00:39:58,565 --> 00:40:00,605
What is it?

453
00:40:03,487 --> 00:40:07,567
<i>Buckaroo Banzai.</i> lt's the latest issue.

454
00:40:10,661 --> 00:40:13,780
Rawhide, come in. Rawhide.

455
00:40:14,331 --> 00:40:15,610
<i>Rawhide.</i>

456
00:40:15,748 --> 00:40:19,996
Buckaroo, what's up? Where in Hades
are you? l'm gettin' a lot of static.

457
00:40:20,128 --> 00:40:23,579
Yeah. That's me.

458
00:40:23,715 --> 00:40:28,422
l've been ionised, but l'm OK now.

459
00:40:28,554 --> 00:40:32,253
Listen, l'm switching
on the homing beacon.

460
00:40:32,391 --> 00:40:36,056
Mark two minute intervals... now.

461
00:40:36,186 --> 00:40:40,764
Look, we got the overthruster. But someone
shanghaied the professor right from the conference.

462
00:40:40,898 --> 00:40:45,643
- Oh, the deuce you say.
<i>- What do you think?</i>

463
00:40:45,777 --> 00:40:49,148
- Dr Lizardo, maybe?
<i>- Yeah, l'd put money on it.</i>

464
00:40:49,282 --> 00:40:51,952
- That crate.
- What crate?

465
00:40:52,077 --> 00:40:54,994
<i>The crate they shoved in that van.</i>

466
00:40:55,121 --> 00:40:56,664
<i>You and the guys...</i>

467
00:40:56,789 --> 00:41:00,539
go back to the house and dig up
everything you can on an outfit called

468
00:41:00,668 --> 00:41:03,041
Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems.

469
00:41:03,172 --> 00:41:06,505
<i>- You got that?</i>
- Right. Yoyodyne. We're on it.

470
00:41:09,594 --> 00:41:13,010
Hand me that tarp, will ya?
Let's cover this guy up.

471
00:41:13,139 --> 00:41:16,175
- Guy? What guy?
- He's got paws.

472
00:41:18,643 --> 00:41:20,804
- Now what?
- Who are they?

473
00:41:22,815 --> 00:41:24,856
Cover it up.

474
00:41:31,824 --> 00:41:33,652
John Bigbooté, Officer.

475
00:41:33,784 --> 00:41:36,489
Head of Operations,
Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems.

476
00:41:36,621 --> 00:41:40,750
- There's one of our birds.
- That fella over there one of your birds, too?

477
00:41:40,876 --> 00:41:42,952
The droid, you mean?

478
00:41:43,835 --> 00:41:48,713
Doesn't look like anything l've seen
before. I mean, l've seen droids...

479
00:41:49,635 --> 00:41:51,045
Nice night, huh?

480
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:07,652
That big thing over there attacked me.

481
00:42:07,777 --> 00:42:10,695
lmpossible. No, no, no, no, no, no.

482
00:42:10,822 --> 00:42:14,523
Yeah! lt's some kinda creature.
There's part of it still stuck in the tree.

483
00:42:14,659 --> 00:42:18,871
No, it's a machine with 30-foot
leather wings. l think it's radioactive.

484
00:42:19,748 --> 00:42:23,532
Three minutes since he last moved.
This is a fix. Something is happening.

485
00:42:23,668 --> 00:42:25,541
Let's get somebody over there.

486
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:28,956
Al, you set up the grid
and get the last known coordinates.

487
00:42:29,090 --> 00:42:32,045
Tommy, hop on the Marconi
and see if we got Blue Blazes

488
00:42:32,177 --> 00:42:35,262
in a ten-minute radius.
But no strike teams, Tommy, understand?

489
00:42:35,389 --> 00:42:38,094
l'm headed downstairs.
Keep everybody calm.

490
00:42:42,436 --> 00:42:45,556
- Hikita-san.
- Buckaroo!

491
00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:50,481
Repeating: intrastate outward band five.

492
00:42:50,612 --> 00:42:54,027
Coded. Calling all Blue Blaze
irregulars in the Garden State.

493
00:42:54,824 --> 00:42:58,952
<i>Buckaroo... in trouble.</i>
<i>Will repeat coordinates.</i>

494
00:42:59,079 --> 00:43:04,369
This is Scooter Lindley, Junior Blue Blaze
irregular 41 and a half. Hang on.

495
00:43:05,710 --> 00:43:09,210
- Dad! Dad! Buckaroo's in trouble!
- Say what?

496
00:43:09,338 --> 00:43:12,922
Aliens from the Eighth Dimension.
l'm seeing them now.

497
00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:14,878
You can see them now? Here?

498
00:43:15,012 --> 00:43:18,795
Yeah, the three jerks driving this van.
Look at this. What is this?

499
00:43:20,516 --> 00:43:22,391
lt's your hand, Buckaroo.

500
00:43:22,518 --> 00:43:26,054
No, no, no, no, it's a formula.
lt's an antidote of some kind.

501
00:43:26,190 --> 00:43:29,641
Whatever that was in that phoney call
from the president gave me information,

502
00:43:29,775 --> 00:43:34,070
some electrochemical message that
allows me to see what they really are.

503
00:43:34,197 --> 00:43:38,527
- What are they?
- Lectroids from Planet Ten
by way of the Eighth Dimension.

504
00:43:39,077 --> 00:43:40,951
Mr Gomez?

505
00:43:41,079 --> 00:43:43,701
- l got a truck on the way to help mop things up.
- ldentification?

506
00:43:43,831 --> 00:43:48,541
Or else this place'll become a zoo,
not to mention a haven for gawkers.

507
00:43:48,670 --> 00:43:50,911
Wait a minute. Now just a second.

508
00:43:51,047 --> 00:43:53,882
- Stay put. All of ya.
- Sure thing.

509
00:43:55,052 --> 00:43:57,422
We'll go ahead and start breaking it down.

510
00:43:57,554 --> 00:43:59,795
Don't touch it!

511
00:43:59,931 --> 00:44:03,347
l got my own help on the way.
Now, that's an order.

512
00:44:07,396 --> 00:44:09,556
Go find something to crack it open.

513
00:44:09,690 --> 00:44:11,398
There's a Harley in those bushes.

514
00:44:11,527 --> 00:44:15,143
l want you to get out and go to the laboratory,
start working on this formula.

515
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:19,822
- l want you to synthesise it.
- Buckaroo! Give me the formula.

516
00:44:35,259 --> 00:44:36,000
Oh, wow!

517
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:38,500
Peggy!

518
00:44:38,554 --> 00:44:42,681
She's not Peggy, Mrs Johnson.
<i>Sois sage, mon amie.</i>

519
00:44:42,806 --> 00:44:46,391
No. Of course not. How could she be?

520
00:44:46,518 --> 00:44:49,474
- Any word from Buckaroo?
- No, l thought he was with you guys.

521
00:44:49,606 --> 00:44:53,900
No, he's not. Ah, Dr Zwibel,
Penny Priddy... Mrs Johnson.

522
00:44:54,027 --> 00:44:57,893
Nice to meet you.
The fellas call me New Jersey.

523
00:45:03,411 --> 00:45:07,244
- Well, where are they all going?
- Bunk house. Off limits.

524
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:13,083
Again, John Gomez!

525
00:45:16,717 --> 00:45:19,172
<i>John O'Connor,
there's a crowbar in the truck.</i>

526
00:45:19,302 --> 00:45:21,342
<i>l'll get it.</i>

527
00:45:35,527 --> 00:45:38,739
Destroy yourself, John Gant.

528
00:45:39,572 --> 00:45:41,612
<i>Set detonator.</i>

529
00:45:45,746 --> 00:45:48,237
<i>Detonator set.</i>

530
00:45:49,208 --> 00:45:54,034
<i>My most profuse apologies</i>
<i>to my homeland and loved ones.</i>

531
00:45:54,170 --> 00:45:58,038
<i>John Valuk is dead. He fell on his head.</i>

532
00:45:59,217 --> 00:46:03,215
<i>Perhaps John Parker will get through</i>
<i>with our message to Buckaroo Banzai.</i>

533
00:46:03,347 --> 00:46:05,967
l said back off! Now, dammit, l mean it!

534
00:46:06,099 --> 00:46:09,266
Hey! Hey, leave him alone! Ugh!

535
00:46:10,228 --> 00:46:14,806
Easy, friend. Ha, Buckaroo Banzai!

536
00:46:17,777 --> 00:46:18,856
Hey!

537
00:46:19,487 --> 00:46:22,442
lt's Buckaroo Banzai! Get him!

538
00:46:33,793 --> 00:46:34,789
Hustle up!

539
00:47:01,789 --> 00:47:06,789
<i>Scooter Lindley, Blue Blaze Irregular.</i>

540
00:47:19,172 --> 00:47:22,920
- It is! lt is Professor Hikita.
- We're closing the gate. Please, step back!

541
00:47:23,050 --> 00:47:26,302
- Where's Buckaroo?

542
00:47:38,858 --> 00:47:42,643
We gotta have something for him.
Try a new cipher.

543
00:47:47,117 --> 00:47:49,608
- Try a G-cipher.
- G-cipher.

544
00:47:51,496 --> 00:47:53,579
There...

545
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:54,780
That's more like it.

546
00:47:55,416 --> 00:48:00,043
Looks like we've accessed their restricted
data file. Could be highly revealing.

547
00:48:00,172 --> 00:48:04,300
No sign of Buckaroo. The professor
just rode up saying something

548
00:48:04,425 --> 00:48:08,505
about space monsters and where's the
overthruster. Went straight to the lab.

549
00:48:08,639 --> 00:48:10,465
Space monsters, my ass.

550
00:48:13,601 --> 00:48:16,306
Hey, man, nice jacket.

551
00:48:23,652 --> 00:48:26,523
What's in the big pink box?

552
00:48:30,409 --> 00:48:33,992
Hey, buddy. May l help you?

553
00:48:34,121 --> 00:48:36,244
Hello! Buckaroo Banzai!?

554
00:48:36,375 --> 00:48:38,864
You a messenger? What you got here?

555
00:48:39,001 --> 00:48:43,047
No, no, wait a minute.
l need see Buckaroo Banzai in person.

556
00:48:43,465 --> 00:48:46,833
My name is John Parker.

557
00:48:46,969 --> 00:48:48,592
ldentify yourself, no?

558
00:48:49,262 --> 00:48:52,050
Blue Blaze irregular Pinky Carruthers.

559
00:48:52,181 --> 00:48:56,643
Sorry, John, everybody
needs see Buckaroo. Later.
