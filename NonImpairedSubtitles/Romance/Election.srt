1
00:00:19,146 --> 00:00:23,776  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:390 Y2:420
(Lawn Sprinkler Pulsing)

2
00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:06,677  X1:334 X2:388 Y1:390 Y2:420
Ugh.

3
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,632  X1:247 X2:475 Y1:390 Y2:420
Hey, Mr. McAllister.

4
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,225  X1:234 X2:487 Y1:358 Y2:419
Not wasting any time,
areyou, Tracy?

5
00:04:05,303 --> 00:04:09,137  X1:220 X2:501 Y1:358 Y2:420
You know what they say
about the early bird.

6
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:10,640  X1:299 X2:419 Y1:390 Y2:417
Yeah, I do.

7
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,268  X1:226 X2:494 Y1:390 Y2:420
Good luck there, Tracy.

8
00:04:14,345 --> 00:04:16,643  X1:253 X2:468 Y1:358 Y2:420
Thanks, Mr. M.
I'll seeyou in class.

9
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:18,147  X1:269 X2:450 Y1:390 Y2:420
Yup, mm-hmm.

10
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:21,378  X1:246 X2:473 Y1:358 Y2:420
Tracy: None ofthis
would've happened

11
00:04:21,452 --> 00:04:24,148  X1:219 X2:501 Y1:358 Y2:420
if Mr. McAllister hadn't
meddled the way he did.

12
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:26,656  X1:207 X2:515 Y1:358 Y2:420
He should'vejust accepted
things as they are,

13
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:29,124  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:358 Y2:420
instead oftrying
to interfere with destiny.

14
00:04:29,194 --> 00:04:32,163  X1:233 X2:488 Y1:358 Y2:419
You see, you can't
interfere with destiny.

15
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,663  X1:229 X2:489 Y1:390 Y2:420
That's why it's destiny.

16
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:35,665  X1:209 X2:510 Y1:390 Y2:420
And ifyou try to interfere,

17
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:38,167  X1:203 X2:515 Y1:358 Y2:420
the same thing's
just gonna happen anyway,

18
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:39,669  X1:241 X2:478 Y1:390 Y2:420
and you'll just suffer.

19
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,674  X1:193 X2:527 Y1:358 Y2:420
Jim: It's hard to remember
how the whole thing started,

20
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:46,175  X1:216 X2:504 Y1:390 Y2:414
the whole election mess.

21
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:49,543  X1:237 X2:483 Y1:358 Y2:420
What I do remember
is that I loved myjob.

22
00:04:49,614 --> 00:04:51,138  X1:272 X2:449 Y1:390 Y2:417
I was a teacher,

23
00:04:51,216 --> 00:04:52,240  X1:287 X2:432 Y1:390 Y2:417
an educator,

24
00:04:52,317 --> 00:04:55,115  X1:230 X2:490 Y1:358 Y2:420
and I couldn't imagine
doing anything else.

25
00:04:55,186 --> 00:04:56,881  X1:248 X2:474 Y1:390 Y2:420
Boy: Mr. McAllister.

26
00:04:56,955 --> 00:04:58,582  X1:324 X2:398 Y1:390 Y2:413
Mr. M!

27
00:04:58,656 --> 00:05:00,978  X1:252 X2:468 Y1:358 Y2:414
Quit daydreaming.
Get back to work.

28
00:05:01,112 --> 00:05:04,673  X1:213 X2:507 Y1:358 Y2:420
Jim: The students knew
it wasn'tjust ajob for me.

29
00:05:04,749 --> 00:05:06,080  X1:279 X2:441 Y1:390 Y2:420
I got involved.

30
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:08,084  X1:214 X2:507 Y1:390 Y2:420
Put down the cards, boys!

31
00:05:08,152 --> 00:05:09,585  X1:256 X2:463 Y1:390 Y2:420
This game is over!

32
00:05:09,654 --> 00:05:11,019  X1:264 X2:454 Y1:390 Y2:420
Jim: And I cared.

33
00:05:11,088 --> 00:05:13,079  X1:233 X2:486 Y1:390 Y2:417
Come on, Wolverines!

34
00:05:13,157 --> 00:05:14,089  X1:260 X2:462 Y1:390 Y2:420
Defense! Let's go!

35
00:05:14,158 --> 00:05:16,092  X1:247 X2:474 Y1:358 Y2:414
Jim: And I think
I made a difference.

36
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,094  X1:255 X2:464 Y1:358 Y2:414
I knew I touched
the students' lives

37
00:05:18,162 --> 00:05:20,596  X1:242 X2:478 Y1:358 Y2:420
during their diffiicult
young adultyears.

38
00:05:20,665 --> 00:05:24,624  X1:226 X2:495 Y1:358 Y2:420
And I took that
responsibility seriously.

39
00:05:24,702 --> 00:05:28,103  X1:243 X2:478 Y1:358 Y2:420
In the 1 2 years
I taught U.S. history,

40
00:05:28,172 --> 00:05:30,606  X1:213 X2:506 Y1:358 Y2:417
civics, and current events
at Carver,

41
00:05:30,675 --> 00:05:33,610  X1:196 X2:522 Y1:358 Y2:414
I was voted
Teacher ofthe Year 3 times.

42
00:05:33,678 --> 00:05:35,441  X1:264 X2:454 Y1:390 Y2:414
A school record.

43
00:05:35,513 --> 00:05:38,607  X1:235 X2:485 Y1:358 Y2:414
Teaching was all
I'd everwanted to do.

44
00:05:40,618 --> 00:05:44,110  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:358 Y2:420
Standing in front of
a roomful ofyoung people,

45
00:05:44,188 --> 00:05:46,622  X1:207 X2:512 Y1:358 Y2:417
trying to get them excited
about the world,

46
00:05:46,691 --> 00:05:48,625  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:390 Y2:420
trying to make them think,

47
00:05:48,693 --> 00:05:52,129  X1:190 X2:531 Y1:358 Y2:414
preparing them for the tough
moral and ethical decisions

48
00:05:52,196 --> 00:05:54,130  X1:213 X2:506 Y1:390 Y2:420
that they'd face as adults,

49
00:05:54,198 --> 00:05:56,063  X1:246 X2:474 Y1:358 Y2:420
that's how I wanted
to spend my life.

50
00:05:57,134 --> 00:05:59,068  X1:262 X2:458 Y1:358 Y2:414
So is this
a moral situation

51
00:05:59,136 --> 00:06:01,297  X1:227 X2:493 Y1:390 Y2:414
or an ethical situation?

52
00:06:01,372 --> 00:06:04,307  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:358 Y2:420
What's the difference between
morals and ethics anyway?

53
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:05,569  X1:302 X2:418 Y1:390 Y2:420
Anybody?

54
00:06:07,144 --> 00:06:08,577  X1:323 X2:398 Y1:390 Y2:414
Derek.

55
00:06:08,646 --> 00:06:10,580  X1:263 X2:459 Y1:358 Y2:420
Yeah. Ethics is
like when you do

56
00:06:10,648 --> 00:06:12,843  X1:234 X2:484 Y1:358 Y2:420
what society tells you
is right to do.

57
00:06:12,917 --> 00:06:14,077  X1:283 X2:435 Y1:390 Y2:414
And morals...

58
00:06:16,654 --> 00:06:18,588  X1:215 X2:504 Y1:358 Y2:420
Yeah, yeah,
you're on the right track.

59
00:06:18,656 --> 00:06:19,816  X1:203 X2:517 Y1:390 Y2:420
Can anybody help him out?

60
00:06:22,526 --> 00:06:23,515  X1:308 X2:413 Y1:390 Y2:414
Michelle.

61
00:06:23,594 --> 00:06:26,085  X1:267 X2:454 Y1:358 Y2:414
Morals are like...
lessons.

62
00:06:26,163 --> 00:06:28,256  X1:244 X2:475 Y1:358 Y2:420
You know, like
the moral ofa story.

63
00:06:28,332 --> 00:06:32,098  X1:231 X2:489 Y1:358 Y2:420
It's whatyou learn
from a story or a fable.

64
00:06:32,169 --> 00:06:34,603  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:390 Y2:420
Or a life experience. Good.

65
00:06:34,672 --> 00:06:35,934  X1:291 X2:429 Y1:390 Y2:414
And ethics?

66
00:06:36,007 --> 00:06:39,602  X1:250 X2:469 Y1:358 Y2:420
Um, ethics is how
you use the morals

67
00:06:39,677 --> 00:06:41,702  X1:271 X2:449 Y1:358 Y2:420
thatyou learn
from the story?

68
00:06:41,779 --> 00:06:45,215  X1:195 X2:525 Y1:358 Y2:420
Yeah, OK, but I thinkwe're
missing something key here.

69
00:06:45,282 --> 00:06:47,113  X1:232 X2:488 Y1:390 Y2:420
What are we missing?

70
00:06:55,092 --> 00:06:55,956  X1:324 X2:394 Y1:390 Y2:419
Tracy.

71
00:06:56,027 --> 00:06:58,257  X1:198 X2:524 Y1:390 Y2:414
Ethics are rules ofconduct--

72
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:00,729  X1:269 X2:450 Y1:390 Y2:420
Jim: Tracy Flick.

73
00:07:00,798 --> 00:07:01,730  X1:294 X2:425 Y1:390 Y2:420
Tracy Flick.

74
00:07:01,799 --> 00:07:03,562  X1:248 X2:471 Y1:358 Y2:414
I'd seen a lot of
ambitious students

75
00:07:03,634 --> 00:07:05,067  X1:198 X2:522 Y1:390 Y2:420
come and go over theyears,

76
00:07:05,136 --> 00:07:08,594  X1:231 X2:489 Y1:358 Y2:420
but Tracy Flick,
she was a special case.

77
00:07:09,774 --> 00:07:11,571  X1:224 X2:496 Y1:358 Y2:417
Tracy: Some people say
I'm an overachiever,

78
00:07:11,642 --> 00:07:13,075  X1:249 X2:471 Y1:358 Y2:420
but I think
they'rejustjealous.

79
00:07:13,144 --> 00:07:15,078  X1:220 X2:502 Y1:358 Y2:414
My mom always tells me
I'm different.

80
00:07:15,146 --> 00:07:16,579  X1:252 X2:466 Y1:390 Y2:420
You know, special.

81
00:07:16,647 --> 00:07:18,080  X1:270 X2:450 Y1:358 Y2:420
And ifyou look
at all the things

82
00:07:18,149 --> 00:07:19,081  X1:220 X2:501 Y1:390 Y2:420
I've accomplished so far,

83
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:21,584  X1:204 X2:516 Y1:390 Y2:420
I thinkyou'd have to agree.

84
00:07:28,192 --> 00:07:30,592  X1:238 X2:486 Y1:358 Y2:414
Here I am as Hodel in
FiddlerOn The Roof.

85
00:07:30,661 --> 00:07:33,596  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:358 Y2:420
[ding] Matchmaker, matchmaker,
I'll bring the veil [ding]

86
00:07:33,664 --> 00:07:35,256  X1:215 X2:506 Y1:390 Y2:420
[ding]You bring the groom [ding]

87
00:07:35,332 --> 00:07:39,098  X1:183 X2:536 Y1:358 Y2:414
Tracy: And here I am on KCHS,
our student-run TV station.

88
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:41,104  X1:222 X2:496 Y1:390 Y2:420
The littering must stop.

89
00:07:41,172 --> 00:07:42,901  X1:235 X2:483 Y1:390 Y2:420
Tracy Flick reporting.

90
00:07:42,973 --> 00:07:45,100  X1:228 X2:493 Y1:358 Y2:416
Tracy:
But it was in the S.G.A.,

91
00:07:45,176 --> 00:07:46,609  X1:215 X2:506 Y1:358 Y2:417
the Student Government
Association,

92
00:07:46,677 --> 00:07:48,110  X1:177 X2:542 Y1:390 Y2:420
where I made my biggest mark.

93
00:07:48,179 --> 00:07:50,113  X1:176 X2:545 Y1:390 Y2:420
I never missed a single meeting.

94
00:07:50,181 --> 00:07:52,115  X1:239 X2:481 Y1:358 Y2:420
And I volunteered
for every committee,

95
00:07:52,183 --> 00:07:54,117  X1:219 X2:500 Y1:390 Y2:420
as long as I could lead it.

96
00:07:54,185 --> 00:07:55,277  X1:247 X2:473 Y1:390 Y2:420
I agree with Ashley!

97
00:07:55,352 --> 00:07:57,047  X1:215 X2:506 Y1:358 Y2:414
I thinkwe should rent
the barrels ahead oftime

98
00:07:57,121 --> 00:07:59,112  X1:220 X2:500 Y1:358 Y2:420
because what happened
last time was a travesty.

99
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:00,350  X1:263 X2:457 Y1:390 Y2:417
It was ridiculous,

100
00:08:00,424 --> 00:08:02,051  X1:200 X2:520 Y1:358 Y2:420
and I think it really
reflected poorly on all ofus.

101
00:08:02,126 --> 00:08:04,560  X1:241 X2:480 Y1:358 Y2:420
Jim: Now Tracy Flick
was poised to win

102
00:08:04,628 --> 00:08:07,096  X1:243 X2:476 Y1:358 Y2:420
the presidency
ofthe student body.

103
00:08:07,164 --> 00:08:10,065  X1:195 X2:525 Y1:358 Y2:420
And so far,
she was running unopposed.

104
00:08:10,134 --> 00:08:13,069  X1:205 X2:515 Y1:358 Y2:420
Determined by a culture
at a certain time in history.

105
00:08:14,238 --> 00:08:16,103  X1:198 X2:523 Y1:358 Y2:420
Jim: Oh, there's
one more thing about Tracy

106
00:08:16,173 --> 00:08:17,800  X1:219 X2:501 Y1:390 Y2:420
I thinkyou should know.

107
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:21,971  X1:236 X2:486 Y1:358 Y2:419
Her pussy gets so wet
you can't believe it.

108
00:08:22,046 --> 00:08:23,980  X1:256 X2:466 Y1:358 Y2:414
(Softly)
Don't tell me that.

109
00:08:24,048 --> 00:08:25,572  X1:211 X2:510 Y1:358 Y2:414
Don't tell me that.
I don't want to know that.

110
00:08:25,649 --> 00:08:27,583  X1:247 X2:474 Y1:358 Y2:417
Jim: A few months
before the election,

111
00:08:27,651 --> 00:08:29,585  X1:244 X2:479 Y1:358 Y2:414
she'd gotten herself
in a little trouble

112
00:08:29,653 --> 00:08:33,111  X1:247 X2:472 Y1:358 Y2:420
with my best friend
Dave Novotny.

113
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:35,090  X1:309 X2:412 Y1:390 Y2:419
[ding] Foxy[ding]

114
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:37,593  X1:214 X2:506 Y1:358 Y2:419
Jim: Dave came to Carver
theyear after I did,

115
00:08:37,661 --> 00:08:39,595  X1:203 X2:517 Y1:390 Y2:420
and we hit it offright away.

116
00:08:39,663 --> 00:08:41,597  X1:203 X2:518 Y1:358 Y2:420
Dave was one ofthose guys
who taught

117
00:08:41,665 --> 00:08:43,098  X1:203 X2:518 Y1:358 Y2:420
because they neverwanted
to leave high school

118
00:08:43,167 --> 00:08:44,600  X1:264 X2:456 Y1:390 Y2:420
in the fiirst place.

119
00:08:44,668 --> 00:08:47,603  X1:174 X2:547 Y1:390 Y2:420
But basically, he was a good guy.

120
00:08:47,671 --> 00:08:50,105  X1:153 X2:566 Y1:390 Y2:417
Ourwives became best friends, too.

121
00:08:50,174 --> 00:08:52,608  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:358 Y2:420
And when Dave and Linda's
son Darryl was born,

122
00:08:52,676 --> 00:08:55,042  X1:249 X2:472 Y1:358 Y2:420
they asked us to be
his godparents.

123
00:08:56,814 --> 00:08:59,248  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:390 Y2:420
Tracy: You probably think the worst,

124
00:08:59,316 --> 00:09:02,046  X1:210 X2:510 Y1:358 Y2:420
that Mr. Novotnywas
taking horrible advantage

125
00:09:02,119 --> 00:09:03,552  X1:233 X2:487 Y1:390 Y2:414
ofone ofhis students.

126
00:09:03,621 --> 00:09:06,055  X1:204 X2:517 Y1:390 Y2:414
But it wasn't like that at all.

127
00:09:06,123 --> 00:09:08,557  X1:218 X2:504 Y1:358 Y2:420
Our relationship was
based on mutual respect

128
00:09:08,626 --> 00:09:09,684  X1:268 X2:451 Y1:390 Y2:414
and admiration.

129
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,558  X1:189 X2:530 Y1:358 Y2:420
I mean, during my
sophomoreyear in geometry,

130
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:14,564  X1:217 X2:503 Y1:358 Y2:420
it was strictly
professional between us.

131
00:09:14,632 --> 00:09:16,532  X1:266 X2:454 Y1:390 Y2:420
I mean, nothing.

132
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,067  X1:217 X2:506 Y1:390 Y2:420
It wasn't until junioryear

133
00:09:18,135 --> 00:09:20,069  X1:205 X2:515 Y1:358 Y2:420
when we worked together
on theyearbook

134
00:09:20,137 --> 00:09:22,071  X1:183 X2:537 Y1:390 Y2:420
that things got kind ofserious.

135
00:09:22,139 --> 00:09:24,073  X1:207 X2:514 Y1:358 Y2:414
One night he took
us editors out to celebrate

136
00:09:24,141 --> 00:09:25,574  X1:267 X2:453 Y1:390 Y2:414
after a deadline.

137
00:09:25,643 --> 00:09:28,077  X1:236 X2:484 Y1:358 Y2:417
Eventually, Dave and I
were left alone,

138
00:09:28,145 --> 00:09:29,578  X1:233 X2:486 Y1:390 Y2:420
and we got to talking.

139
00:09:29,647 --> 00:09:31,581  X1:192 X2:530 Y1:390 Y2:417
Not like teacher and student,

140
00:09:31,649 --> 00:09:33,082  X1:264 X2:456 Y1:390 Y2:414
but like 2 adults.

141
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:34,583  X1:261 X2:458 Y1:390 Y2:420
You know, Tracy,

142
00:09:34,652 --> 00:09:36,586  X1:225 X2:495 Y1:358 Y2:420
I notice that
you don't seem to have

143
00:09:36,654 --> 00:09:38,588  X1:206 X2:514 Y1:390 Y2:420
any close friends at Carver.

144
00:09:38,656 --> 00:09:40,590  X1:180 X2:538 Y1:390 Y2:414
You seem to be kind ofa loner.

145
00:09:40,658 --> 00:09:43,422  X1:261 X2:460 Y1:358 Y2:419
No, I'm not.
I'm just real busy.

146
00:09:43,494 --> 00:09:46,088  X1:231 X2:489 Y1:358 Y2:420
Oh, no. I know, I know
it's not by choice.

147
00:09:46,163 --> 00:09:48,597  X1:201 X2:519 Y1:390 Y2:420
I just mean that, that, well...

148
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:51,100  X1:171 X2:550 Y1:390 Y2:420
being the kind ofperson you are,

149
00:09:51,168 --> 00:09:53,102  X1:176 X2:544 Y1:390 Y2:420
it must be really diffiicult foryou

150
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:54,933  X1:259 X2:463 Y1:358 Y2:420
to fiind somebody
you could talk to.

151
00:09:55,005 --> 00:09:56,597  X1:243 X2:476 Y1:390 Y2:420
What doyou mean?

152
00:09:56,674 --> 00:09:59,074  X1:207 X2:513 Y1:390 Y2:420
What kind ofperson am I?

153
00:10:01,178 --> 00:10:05,114  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:358 Y2:420
Tracy, you know, I've been
watching you for going on...

154
00:10:05,182 --> 00:10:06,615  X1:288 X2:432 Y1:390 Y2:419
3 years now,

155
00:10:06,684 --> 00:10:09,812  X1:213 X2:506 Y1:358 Y2:417
and I thinkyou are
one ofthe most talented,

156
00:10:09,887 --> 00:10:13,050  X1:244 X2:475 Y1:358 Y2:417
hard-working,
sensitive, attractive,

157
00:10:13,123 --> 00:10:15,114  X1:245 X2:477 Y1:390 Y2:414
brilliant students I--

158
00:10:15,192 --> 00:10:16,124  X1:341 X2:381 Y1:390 Y2:413
No.

159
00:10:17,528 --> 00:10:19,894  X1:183 X2:538 Y1:390 Y2:420
Human beings I have ever met.

160
00:10:21,198 --> 00:10:22,187  X1:296 X2:423 Y1:390 Y2:420
Thankyou.

161
00:10:22,266 --> 00:10:25,133  X1:205 X2:515 Y1:358 Y2:420
And I know that
sometimes people likeyou

162
00:10:25,202 --> 00:10:29,138  X1:250 X2:470 Y1:358 Y2:420
have to pay a price
for their greatness.

163
00:10:29,206 --> 00:10:31,800  X1:199 X2:519 Y1:390 Y2:420
And that price is loneliness.

164
00:10:31,876 --> 00:10:35,312  X1:225 X2:495 Y1:358 Y2:420
I don't know.
maybe I'm wrong, but...

165
00:10:35,379 --> 00:10:40,112  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:358 Y2:420
itjust seems to me like
you might need a friend.

166
00:10:43,721 --> 00:10:45,484  X1:232 X2:487 Y1:358 Y2:416
Tracy: Since I grew up
without a dad,

167
00:10:45,556 --> 00:10:46,989  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:390 Y2:420
you might assume, psychologically,

168
00:10:47,057 --> 00:10:49,150  X1:255 X2:464 Y1:358 Y2:420
I was looking
for a father fiigure.

169
00:10:49,226 --> 00:10:51,660  X1:241 X2:481 Y1:358 Y2:414
But that had nothing
to do with it at all.

170
00:10:51,729 --> 00:10:53,663  X1:248 X2:474 Y1:358 Y2:420
It wasjust that
Dave was so strong,

171
00:10:53,731 --> 00:10:56,700  X1:232 X2:487 Y1:358 Y2:420
and he made me feel
so safe and protected.

172
00:10:56,767 --> 00:11:00,601  X1:175 X2:545 Y1:358 Y2:420
It was the fiirst time
somebody ever saw the real me,

173
00:11:00,671 --> 00:11:02,605  X1:176 X2:544 Y1:390 Y2:420
the me that nobody else knows.

174
00:11:02,673 --> 00:11:05,733  X1:181 X2:539 Y1:390 Y2:417
OK, here. Get down. Get down.

175
00:11:15,152 --> 00:11:17,086  X1:267 X2:454 Y1:390 Y2:418
[ding]You're once [ding]

176
00:11:17,154 --> 00:11:18,086  X1:301 X2:419 Y1:390 Y2:418
[ding]Twice [ding]

177
00:11:20,157 --> 00:11:24,594  X1:230 X2:490 Y1:390 Y2:420
[ding]Three times a lady[ding]

178
00:11:26,163 --> 00:11:32,102  X1:254 X2:467 Y1:390 Y2:420
[ding]And I loveyou [ding]

179
00:11:33,671 --> 00:11:36,105  X1:242 X2:478 Y1:390 Y2:419
[ding]Yes, you're once [ding]

180
00:11:36,173 --> 00:11:37,606  X1:301 X2:419 Y1:390 Y2:418
[ding]Twice [ding]

181
00:11:39,677 --> 00:11:41,611  X1:230 X2:490 Y1:390 Y2:420
[ding]Three times a lady[ding]

182
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:43,112  X1:322 X2:397 Y1:390 Y2:420
(Slurp)

183
00:11:45,182 --> 00:11:53,021  X1:254 X2:467 Y1:390 Y2:420
[ding]And I loveyou [ding]

184
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:54,022  X1:325 X2:394 Y1:390 Y2:420
(Gulp)

185
00:11:55,092 --> 00:11:58,550  X1:305 X2:416 Y1:390 Y2:419
[ding] I love [ding]

186
00:11:58,629 --> 00:12:00,028  X1:313 X2:407 Y1:390 Y2:418
[ding]You [ding]

187
00:12:01,198 --> 00:12:03,063  X1:215 X2:505 Y1:358 Y2:420
Tracy: When I think back
on my relationship

188
00:12:03,133 --> 00:12:04,566  X1:254 X2:465 Y1:390 Y2:420
with Mr. Novotny,

189
00:12:04,635 --> 00:12:07,570  X1:193 X2:526 Y1:390 Y2:414
what I miss most is our talks.

190
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:12,074  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:390 Y2:420
You did it in your house?

191
00:12:12,142 --> 00:12:13,575  X1:248 X2:473 Y1:390 Y2:420
In your own house?

192
00:12:13,644 --> 00:12:16,704  X1:178 X2:542 Y1:390 Y2:420
OK, I know it seems crazy, but...

193
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:20,079  X1:246 X2:473 Y1:358 Y2:420
Jim, what I'm trying
to tell you is that...

194
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,583  X1:287 X2:432 Y1:390 Y2:420
Tracy and I...

195
00:12:21,652 --> 00:12:24,086  X1:249 X2:470 Y1:390 Y2:420
are totally, totally...

196
00:12:24,154 --> 00:12:26,179  X1:320 X2:401 Y1:390 Y2:414
in love.

197
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:29,541  X1:307 X2:413 Y1:358 Y2:414
- In love?
- Yeah.

198
00:12:29,616 --> 00:12:30,708  X1:296 X2:425 Y1:390 Y2:413
It's serious.

199
00:12:30,784 --> 00:12:33,719  X1:224 X2:496 Y1:358 Y2:414
She inspires me in ways
that Linda never has.

200
00:12:33,787 --> 00:12:35,880  X1:168 X2:552 Y1:390 Y2:420
She even wants to read my novel.

201
00:12:35,956 --> 00:12:38,049  X1:249 X2:469 Y1:358 Y2:420
Butyou haven't
written your novel.

202
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:39,558  X1:226 X2:493 Y1:390 Y2:420
That's the whole point!

203
00:12:39,626 --> 00:12:42,060  X1:209 X2:512 Y1:358 Y2:420
I--I've got the whole thing
right here!

204
00:12:42,129 --> 00:12:44,063  X1:253 X2:467 Y1:358 Y2:420
I just need
to get it out there.

205
00:12:44,131 --> 00:12:47,567  X1:181 X2:539 Y1:358 Y2:414
And Tracywants me to write it
so she can read it.

206
00:12:47,634 --> 00:12:48,566  X1:285 X2:435 Y1:390 Y2:414
It's beautiful.

207
00:12:48,635 --> 00:12:50,068  X1:324 X2:398 Y1:390 Y2:413
Dave...

208
00:12:50,137 --> 00:12:53,573  X1:254 X2:466 Y1:358 Y2:420
I'm just saying this
as your friend.

209
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:57,201  X1:239 X2:479 Y1:358 Y2:420
Whatyou're doing is
really, reallywrong,

210
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:59,245  X1:232 X2:487 Y1:390 Y2:420
and you've gotta stop.

211
00:12:59,312 --> 00:13:01,337  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:390 Y2:420
The lineyou've crossed is...

212
00:13:01,414 --> 00:13:03,348  X1:277 X2:442 Y1:358 Y2:420
It's immoral,
and it's illegal.

213
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:04,849  X1:280 X2:438 Y1:390 Y2:419
Jim, come on.

214
00:13:04,918 --> 00:13:07,079  X1:178 X2:542 Y1:390 Y2:414
I don't need a lecture on ethics.

215
00:13:07,154 --> 00:13:08,348  X1:198 X2:523 Y1:390 Y2:420
I'm not talking about ethics.

216
00:13:08,421 --> 00:13:09,979  X1:216 X2:504 Y1:390 Y2:420
I'm talking about morals.

217
00:13:11,591 --> 00:13:13,718  X1:228 X2:492 Y1:390 Y2:414
What's the difference?

218
00:13:13,794 --> 00:13:15,523  X1:232 X2:489 Y1:358 Y2:419
Jim: I guess
I don't have to tell you

219
00:13:15,595 --> 00:13:17,529  X1:226 X2:494 Y1:390 Y2:414
how this all turned out.

220
00:13:24,104 --> 00:13:25,036  X1:275 X2:444 Y1:390 Y2:418
(Clears Throat)

221
00:13:34,114 --> 00:13:36,048  X1:276 X2:442 Y1:390 Y2:419
Tracy's mom...

222
00:13:36,116 --> 00:13:38,243  X1:221 X2:498 Y1:390 Y2:414
she doesn't understand.

223
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:40,047  X1:230 X2:491 Y1:390 Y2:420
No. I'd say she doesn't.

224
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:44,557  X1:219 X2:502 Y1:358 Y2:420
Fact is, I have never seen
a mother so upset.

225
00:13:44,624 --> 00:13:45,682  X1:322 X2:398 Y1:390 Y2:420
(Sighs)

226
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:48,819  X1:229 X2:490 Y1:358 Y2:420
All right. I know what
Tracy told her mother,

227
00:13:48,895 --> 00:13:50,556  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:390 Y2:414
what her mother told me.

228
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,564  X1:201 X2:520 Y1:390 Y2:420
I need to hear this from you

229
00:13:52,632 --> 00:13:54,566  X1:209 X2:511 Y1:358 Y2:420
because I have
a legal responsibility here.

230
00:13:54,634 --> 00:13:56,499  X1:248 X2:474 Y1:390 Y2:420
Let me askyou this.

231
00:13:59,072 --> 00:14:01,905  X1:237 X2:485 Y1:358 Y2:420
Did you cross the line
with this girl?

232
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:10,515  X1:333 X2:389 Y1:390 Y2:414
I di--

233
00:14:12,085 --> 00:14:13,017  X1:312 X2:407 Y1:390 Y2:413
W-We...

234
00:14:15,088 --> 00:14:17,022  X1:280 X2:439 Y1:390 Y2:414
We're in love.

235
00:14:21,595 --> 00:14:22,789  X1:253 X2:469 Y1:390 Y2:414
Linda: Your novel?!

236
00:14:22,863 --> 00:14:24,524  X1:193 X2:527 Y1:390 Y2:420
Areyou fucking kidding me?

237
00:14:24,598 --> 00:14:25,530  X1:321 X2:401 Y1:390 Y2:414
Linda...

238
00:14:25,599 --> 00:14:27,032  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:390 Y2:420
Jim: After Dave got fiired,

239
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,533  X1:165 X2:558 Y1:390 Y2:414
Linda kicked him out ofthe house

240
00:14:28,602 --> 00:14:30,035  X1:241 X2:478 Y1:390 Y2:414
and fiiled for divorce.

241
00:14:30,103 --> 00:14:33,038  X1:204 X2:517 Y1:358 Y2:420
He ended up
moving back to Milwaukee

242
00:14:33,106 --> 00:14:34,038  X1:226 X2:494 Y1:390 Y2:420
to live with his parents.

243
00:14:34,107 --> 00:14:35,369  X1:218 X2:504 Y1:390 Y2:420
He's lucky he's not injail.

244
00:14:35,442 --> 00:14:36,909  X1:327 X2:395 Y1:390 Y2:414
Linda!

245
00:14:39,112 --> 00:14:41,239  X1:197 X2:523 Y1:390 Y2:414
And ethics are the basis of--

246
00:14:41,314 --> 00:14:42,372  X1:264 X2:456 Y1:390 Y2:420
(Class Bell Rings)

247
00:14:42,449 --> 00:14:44,383  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:390 Y2:420
OK. We'll pick up here next time.

248
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:51,050  X1:199 X2:520 Y1:390 Y2:420
Would it be possible for me

249
00:14:51,124 --> 00:14:53,422  X1:247 X2:472 Y1:358 Y2:420
to retake the test
we tookyesterday?

250
00:14:53,493 --> 00:14:54,926  X1:237 X2:482 Y1:358 Y2:414
The testyesterday?
You wanna retake it?

251
00:14:54,995 --> 00:14:57,020  X1:248 X2:473 Y1:358 Y2:420
Yeah. I had to work
the night before,

252
00:14:57,097 --> 00:14:58,029  X1:232 X2:487 Y1:358 Y2:420
and I didn't have
enough time to study.

253
00:14:58,098 --> 00:14:59,030  X1:303 X2:417 Y1:390 Y2:420
Oh, yeah?

254
00:15:00,367 --> 00:15:02,335  X1:229 X2:490 Y1:358 Y2:420
Tracy: Now that I have
more life experience,

255
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:04,632  X1:254 X2:466 Y1:358 Y2:414
I feel sorry
for Mr. McAllister.

256
00:15:04,704 --> 00:15:07,639  X1:202 X2:520 Y1:358 Y2:417
I mean, anyone who's stuck
in the same little room,

257
00:15:07,707 --> 00:15:09,504  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:390 Y2:420
wearing the same stupid clothes,

258
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:12,511  X1:222 X2:498 Y1:358 Y2:420
same exact same things
year afteryear

259
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:14,012  X1:261 X2:458 Y1:390 Y2:417
for his whole life,

260
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,514  X1:227 X2:492 Y1:358 Y2:420
while his students
go on to good colleges

261
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:19,518  X1:232 X2:487 Y1:358 Y2:420
and move to big cities
and do great things

262
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:22,487  X1:210 X2:510 Y1:390 Y2:420
and make loads ofmoney,

263
00:15:22,555 --> 00:15:24,523  X1:241 X2:481 Y1:358 Y2:420
he's gotta be at least
a littlejealous.

264
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:26,024  X1:252 X2:467 Y1:358 Y2:420
I noticed it was
a little low foryou.

265
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:27,491  X1:236 X2:485 Y1:358 Y2:419
Tracy:
It's like my mom says:

266
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:31,018  X1:203 X2:515 Y1:358 Y2:420
The weak are always trying
to sabotage the strong.

267
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:33,531  X1:204 X2:517 Y1:358 Y2:414
One thing that's important
to know about me

268
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,033  X1:224 X2:496 Y1:390 Y2:420
is that I'm an only child,

269
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:37,535  X1:227 X2:494 Y1:364 Y2:420
so my mom
is really devoted to me.

270
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:39,037  X1:223 X2:495 Y1:390 Y2:414
And I love her so much.

271
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:41,039  X1:251 X2:469 Y1:358 Y2:420
She wants me
to do all the things

272
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:43,541  X1:233 X2:488 Y1:358 Y2:414
that she wanted to do
in life but couldn't.

273
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,544  X1:190 X2:531 Y1:358 Y2:417
Mom used to be a stewardess
for Northwest,

274
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:48,046  X1:165 X2:554 Y1:390 Y2:420
and now she works as a paralegal.

275
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:50,048  X1:219 X2:501 Y1:358 Y2:414
She likes to write letters
to successful women

276
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:52,050  X1:253 X2:468 Y1:358 Y2:420
like Elizabeth Dole
and Connie Chung

277
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:54,052  X1:203 X2:518 Y1:358 Y2:420
and ask them how they got
to be where they are

278
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,985  X1:242 X2:477 Y1:358 Y2:420
and what advice
do they have for me,

279
00:15:56,056 --> 00:15:58,115  X1:242 X2:476 Y1:390 Y2:420
Tracy, her daughter.

280
00:15:58,191 --> 00:15:59,488  X1:258 X2:463 Y1:390 Y2:417
9 times out of 1 0,

281
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:01,493  X1:213 X2:507 Y1:358 Y2:420
they sayyou have
to hold ontoyour dreams

282
00:16:01,561 --> 00:16:02,493  X1:268 X2:453 Y1:390 Y2:414
no matterwhat.

283
00:16:02,562 --> 00:16:03,494  X1:205 X2:515 Y1:390 Y2:420
The pressures women face

284
00:16:03,563 --> 00:16:05,497  X1:226 X2:496 Y1:358 Y2:417
mean you have to work
twice as hard,

285
00:16:05,565 --> 00:16:09,001  X1:196 X2:524 Y1:358 Y2:420
and you can't let anything
or anyone stand in yourway.

286
00:16:09,069 --> 00:16:10,502  X1:308 X2:414 Y1:390 Y2:419
Hey! Hey!

287
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,697  X1:267 X2:453 Y1:358 Y2:413
One per person!
Put those back!

288
00:16:12,772 --> 00:16:14,239  X1:319 X2:403 Y1:390 Y2:413
Eat me.

289
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:17,003  X1:216 X2:502 Y1:358 Y2:420
Tracy: Butyou know,
winning isn't everything.

290
00:16:17,077 --> 00:16:21,013  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:358 Y2:420
Win or lose, ethical conduct
is the most important thing.

291
00:16:21,081 --> 00:16:22,708  X1:225 X2:493 Y1:390 Y2:420
Just ask Mr. McAllister.

292
00:16:22,782 --> 00:16:24,010  X1:275 X2:446 Y1:390 Y2:414
Mr. McAllister!

293
00:16:24,084 --> 00:16:26,882  X1:226 X2:495 Y1:390 Y2:420
Mr. McAllister, wait up!

294
00:16:26,953 --> 00:16:28,511  X1:221 X2:501 Y1:390 Y2:420
Mr. McAllister, don't go!

295
00:16:31,591 --> 00:16:33,525  X1:230 X2:490 Y1:390 Y2:420
I got all my signatures.

296
00:16:33,593 --> 00:16:36,027  X1:155 X2:563 Y1:390 Y2:420
There's 1 58, way more than I need.

297
00:16:36,096 --> 00:16:37,529  X1:262 X2:459 Y1:390 Y2:420
Hey, that's super.

298
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:39,030  X1:280 X2:441 Y1:390 Y2:420
Here they are.

299
00:16:39,099 --> 00:16:40,532  X1:245 X2:476 Y1:358 Y2:420
Oh, you canjust
put them in my box,

300
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,363  X1:249 X2:470 Y1:358 Y2:414
and I'll take a look
at them tomorrow.

301
00:16:42,435 --> 00:16:44,027  X1:190 X2:531 Y1:390 Y2:420
Could you approve them now

302
00:16:44,104 --> 00:16:46,038  X1:221 X2:498 Y1:358 Y2:420
because I'd really like
to kick offmy campaign

303
00:16:46,106 --> 00:16:48,040  X1:235 X2:485 Y1:358 Y2:420
right away, you know,
in the morning.

304
00:16:48,108 --> 00:16:49,040  X1:327 X2:394 Y1:390 Y2:420
Right.

305
00:16:55,048 --> 00:16:57,983  X1:222 X2:496 Y1:358 Y2:420
Yeah, yeah.
Those look good to me.

306
00:16:58,051 --> 00:16:59,985  X1:153 X2:567 Y1:390 Y2:420
Aren'tyou supposed to keep them?

307
00:17:00,053 --> 00:17:01,486  X1:275 X2:447 Y1:390 Y2:414
No. That's fiine.

308
00:17:01,554 --> 00:17:03,545  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:358 Y2:420
I thoughtyou were
supposed to keep them.

309
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:07,993  X1:240 X2:478 Y1:390 Y2:420
Yeah, right, fiine, OK.

310
00:17:08,061 --> 00:17:09,494  X1:230 X2:489 Y1:390 Y2:420
Thanks for everything.

311
00:17:09,562 --> 00:17:10,494  X1:311 X2:408 Y1:390 Y2:414
You bet.

312
00:17:14,067 --> 00:17:16,501  X1:236 X2:484 Y1:358 Y2:419
I can't wait
to start campaigning.

313
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:17,501  X1:285 X2:434 Y1:390 Y2:414
What's that?

314
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:19,003  X1:236 X2:484 Y1:358 Y2:419
I can't wait
to start campaigning.

315
00:17:19,072 --> 00:17:21,006  X1:253 X2:467 Y1:358 Y2:420
Oh. Well, it should
be easy foryou.

316
00:17:21,074 --> 00:17:22,507  X1:228 X2:492 Y1:390 Y2:420
So far, no competition.

317
00:17:22,575 --> 00:17:24,509  X1:242 X2:476 Y1:358 Y2:420
Yeah, butyou know,
Coca-Cola's by far

318
00:17:24,577 --> 00:17:25,509  X1:160 X2:560 Y1:390 Y2:417
the world's number one soft drink,

319
00:17:25,578 --> 00:17:27,512  X1:206 X2:516 Y1:358 Y2:420
and they spend
more money than anybody

320
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:28,638  X1:274 X2:445 Y1:390 Y2:420
on advertising.

321
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:32,014  X1:222 X2:500 Y1:358 Y2:420
I guess that's how come
they stay number one.

322
00:17:32,085 --> 00:17:33,518  X1:327 X2:391 Y1:390 Y2:414
Yeah.

323
00:17:33,586 --> 00:17:36,020  X1:170 X2:550 Y1:390 Y2:420
OK. Well, good luck there, Tracy.

324
00:17:36,089 --> 00:17:39,252  X1:251 X2:467 Y1:390 Y2:417
You know, Mr. M...

325
00:17:39,325 --> 00:17:41,520  X1:204 X2:514 Y1:358 Y2:420
when I win the presidency,
that means you and I

326
00:17:41,594 --> 00:17:43,858  X1:228 X2:492 Y1:358 Y2:420
are gonna be spending
a lot oftime together,

327
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:47,024  X1:213 X2:508 Y1:358 Y2:414
and I for one would really
like that time to be...

328
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:50,263  X1:198 X2:523 Y1:390 Y2:420
harmonious and productive.

329
00:17:50,336 --> 00:17:52,065  X1:274 X2:445 Y1:390 Y2:420
Wouldn'tyou?

330
00:17:53,139 --> 00:17:54,071  X1:330 X2:389 Y1:390 Y2:413
Sure.

331
00:17:56,609 --> 00:17:57,633  X1:338 X2:381 Y1:390 Y2:413
OK.

332
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:59,507  X1:231 X2:487 Y1:358 Y2:420
That's what I thought.
I wasjust checking.

333
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:01,945  X1:190 X2:528 Y1:390 Y2:420
Yeah. Good luck there, Tracy.

334
00:18:02,015 --> 00:18:03,812  X1:338 X2:381 Y1:390 Y2:413
OK.

335
00:18:08,555 --> 00:18:11,490  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:358 Y2:420
Jim: I don't blame Tracy
forwhat happened with Dave.

336
00:18:11,558 --> 00:18:12,889  X1:286 X2:436 Y1:390 Y2:414
How could I?

337
00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:15,291  X1:216 X2:505 Y1:358 Y2:420
Dave was an adult,
more than twice her age.

338
00:18:15,361 --> 00:18:18,489  X1:205 X2:515 Y1:358 Y2:417
Sure, she got on my nerves
once in a while,

339
00:18:18,565 --> 00:18:21,500  X1:245 X2:476 Y1:358 Y2:420
but I admired Tracy.
I really did.

340
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:27,233  X1:224 X2:495 Y1:358 Y2:420
Thank God for Diane.
She was my best friend.

341
00:18:27,307 --> 00:18:29,502  X1:180 X2:542 Y1:390 Y2:420
My source oflove and strength.

342
00:18:29,576 --> 00:18:31,510  X1:209 X2:510 Y1:358 Y2:420
Oh, sure, we'd had
our share ofbumpy times,

343
00:18:31,578 --> 00:18:34,138  X1:152 X2:569 Y1:390 Y2:420
but we'd always seen them through.

344
00:18:34,214 --> 00:18:38,014  X1:211 X2:507 Y1:358 Y2:414
After 9 years ofmarriage,
we were closer than ever.

345
00:18:39,586 --> 00:18:40,610  X1:259 X2:461 Y1:390 Y2:420
Anything wrong?

346
00:18:42,088 --> 00:18:43,521  X1:317 X2:405 Y1:390 Y2:413
No. No.

347
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:45,615  X1:228 X2:491 Y1:390 Y2:420
Just, you know, school.

348
00:18:51,097 --> 00:18:53,463  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:390 Y2:420
Tracy: When I win the presidency,

349
00:18:53,533 --> 00:18:56,969  X1:213 X2:505 Y1:358 Y2:420
we're gonna be spending
a lot oftime together.

350
00:18:57,036 --> 00:19:00,972  X1:191 X2:530 Y1:390 Y2:414
Lots and lots and lots oftime.

351
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,975  X1:234 X2:487 Y1:390 Y2:414
President and advisor.

352
00:19:04,043 --> 00:19:07,479  X1:197 X2:525 Y1:390 Y2:420
Harmonious and productive.

353
00:19:07,547 --> 00:19:10,482  X1:258 X2:462 Y1:390 Y2:420
Close and special.

354
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:12,745  X1:296 X2:423 Y1:390 Y2:414
You...and I.

355
00:19:44,546 --> 00:19:45,979  X1:261 X2:458 Y1:390 Y2:419
Woman: Hey, P.J .

356
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:47,981  X1:186 X2:536 Y1:358 Y2:420
Man: What areyou doing here
in the boys' locker room?

357
00:19:48,049 --> 00:19:49,539  X1:241 X2:480 Y1:358 Y2:419
I've come to see
the star quarterback

358
00:19:49,617 --> 00:19:50,982  X1:240 X2:480 Y1:390 Y2:420
before the big game.

359
00:19:51,052 --> 00:19:53,486  X1:137 X2:585 Y1:390 Y2:414
But what ifCoach Henderson walks in?

360
00:19:53,555 --> 00:19:56,183  X1:256 X2:465 Y1:358 Y2:414
Oh, that's OK.
I took care ofhim.

361
00:19:56,257 --> 00:19:57,986  X1:212 X2:509 Y1:390 Y2:420
So, uh, whatyou reading?

362
00:19:58,059 --> 00:20:00,926  X1:179 X2:542 Y1:390 Y2:420
I'm just reviewing my playbook.

363
00:20:00,996 --> 00:20:03,487  X1:194 X2:527 Y1:390 Y2:420
I have a playwe can practice.

364
00:20:03,565 --> 00:20:04,998  X1:242 X2:477 Y1:390 Y2:420
You be quarterback.

365
00:20:05,066 --> 00:20:07,296  X1:270 X2:451 Y1:390 Y2:420
I'll be tight end.

366
00:20:07,369 --> 00:20:08,301  X1:309 X2:410 Y1:390 Y2:420
(Coughs)

367
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:10,497  X1:251 X2:468 Y1:390 Y2:420
(Woman Grunting)

368
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:21,014  X1:254 X2:468 Y1:358 Y2:420
Tracy: You know,
Coca-Cola is by far

369
00:20:21,082 --> 00:20:24,017  X1:160 X2:560 Y1:390 Y2:414
the world's number one soft drink.

370
00:20:32,594 --> 00:20:33,993  X1:334 X2:388 Y1:390 Y2:414
Paul.

371
00:20:34,062 --> 00:20:34,994  X1:333 X2:386 Y1:390 Y2:414
Aah!

372
00:20:41,603 --> 00:20:43,662  X1:282 X2:436 Y1:390 Y2:414
Aah! Aaahhh!

373
00:20:43,738 --> 00:20:45,535  X1:333 X2:386 Y1:390 Y2:414
Aah!

374
00:20:45,607 --> 00:20:47,541  X1:216 X2:506 Y1:358 Y2:420
Paul: I was so mad at God
when I broke my leg

375
00:20:47,609 --> 00:20:49,770  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:390 Y2:420
at Shadow Ridge over Christmas break.

376
00:20:49,844 --> 00:20:52,472  X1:323 X2:395 Y1:390 Y2:420
Why?!

377
00:20:52,547 --> 00:20:54,538  X1:235 X2:485 Y1:358 Y2:420
The doctors told me
I'd have to quit sports

378
00:20:54,616 --> 00:20:57,244  X1:231 X2:488 Y1:358 Y2:420
for at least a couple
ofyears, ifnot forever,

379
00:20:57,318 --> 00:20:58,979  X1:207 X2:516 Y1:358 Y2:420
which meant
no fiirst-string quarterback

380
00:20:59,054 --> 00:21:00,487  X1:304 X2:417 Y1:390 Y2:414
in the fall.

381
00:21:00,555 --> 00:21:02,489  X1:196 X2:524 Y1:390 Y2:420
It was like the end ofmy life.

382
00:21:02,557 --> 00:21:05,492  X1:191 X2:528 Y1:358 Y2:420
When I got back to school,
everybodywas so supportive,

383
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:08,495  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:358 Y2:420
and they all wanted to sign
my cast and everything,

384
00:21:08,563 --> 00:21:10,793  X1:259 X2:463 Y1:358 Y2:420
but I still couldn't
shake the feeling

385
00:21:10,865 --> 00:21:12,992  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:390 Y2:420
that now my life had no purpose.

386
00:21:13,068 --> 00:21:15,002  X1:188 X2:532 Y1:390 Y2:414
What did God want from me?

387
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:17,504  X1:267 X2:452 Y1:390 Y2:420
Why did I exist?

388
00:21:17,572 --> 00:21:20,507  X1:206 X2:514 Y1:358 Y2:420
Sometimes you can search
everywhere for answers.

389
00:21:20,575 --> 00:21:23,009  X1:240 X2:480 Y1:358 Y2:420
Then one day,
destinyjust walks up

390
00:21:23,078 --> 00:21:25,012  X1:189 X2:530 Y1:390 Y2:420
and taps you on the shoulder.

391
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:28,015  X1:159 X2:562 Y1:390 Y2:420
I know because it happened to me.

392
00:21:29,918 --> 00:21:32,716  X1:239 X2:482 Y1:358 Y2:420
Jim: Paul, can I speak
toyou for a minute?

393
00:21:32,787 --> 00:21:35,221  X1:247 X2:476 Y1:358 Y2:420
Paul: Mr. McAllister
changed my life.

394
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:38,521  X1:192 X2:528 Y1:358 Y2:417
And no matterwhat they say
he did or did not do,

395
00:21:38,593 --> 00:21:41,027  X1:209 X2:512 Y1:390 Y2:420
I believe he is a good man.

396
00:21:41,096 --> 00:21:44,532  X1:252 X2:471 Y1:358 Y2:420
Paul, I knowyou've
been pretty down

397
00:21:44,599 --> 00:21:46,226  X1:245 X2:475 Y1:390 Y2:420
sinceyour accident.

398
00:21:46,301 --> 00:21:49,737  X1:232 X2:489 Y1:358 Y2:420
Yeah. I wanted to play
football again so bad

399
00:21:49,804 --> 00:21:50,896  X1:275 X2:446 Y1:390 Y2:417
I could taste it,

400
00:21:50,972 --> 00:21:53,031  X1:243 X2:478 Y1:358 Y2:420
and maybe go on
to the playoffs and--

401
00:21:53,108 --> 00:21:54,040  X1:319 X2:402 Y1:390 Y2:414
I know.

402
00:21:54,109 --> 00:21:55,371  X1:189 X2:532 Y1:390 Y2:420
I understand disappointment.

403
00:21:55,443 --> 00:21:56,410  X1:301 X2:419 Y1:390 Y2:420
I really do.

404
00:21:56,478 --> 00:21:57,410  X1:327 X2:391 Y1:390 Y2:414
Yeah.

405
00:21:57,479 --> 00:21:58,537  X1:228 X2:496 Y1:390 Y2:420
Now, I personally think

406
00:21:58,613 --> 00:22:00,547  X1:232 X2:487 Y1:358 Y2:420
you have a very bright
future ahead ofyou.

407
00:22:00,615 --> 00:22:01,980  X1:210 X2:510 Y1:390 Y2:420
And I'm not talking about

408
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:04,075  X1:203 X2:516 Y1:390 Y2:420
the fleeting glory ofsports.

409
00:22:04,152 --> 00:22:05,585  X1:243 X2:476 Y1:390 Y2:420
What doyou mean?

410
00:22:05,653 --> 00:22:07,143  X1:230 X2:491 Y1:390 Y2:420
Let me giveyou a clue.

411
00:22:07,222 --> 00:22:08,985  X1:192 X2:526 Y1:390 Y2:414
You're a natural-born leader.

412
00:22:09,057 --> 00:22:11,992  X1:204 X2:516 Y1:358 Y2:420
You're one ofthe most
popular students at Carver.

413
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:13,493  X1:226 X2:493 Y1:358 Y2:420
You're honest,
you're straightforward,

414
00:22:13,561 --> 00:22:15,188  X1:153 X2:567 Y1:390 Y2:420
and you don't crack under pressure,

415
00:22:15,263 --> 00:22:17,231  X1:208 X2:513 Y1:358 Y2:420
as we all saw in
an amazing fourth quarter

416
00:22:17,298 --> 00:22:18,925  X1:258 X2:462 Y1:390 Y2:420
against Westside.

417
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,991  X1:205 X2:514 Y1:390 Y2:420
All the kids look up toyou.

418
00:22:21,069 --> 00:22:22,866  X1:205 X2:517 Y1:390 Y2:420
Now, what does that spell?

419
00:22:28,576 --> 00:22:30,009  X1:304 X2:415 Y1:390 Y2:414
Student...

420
00:22:30,078 --> 00:22:31,511  X1:308 X2:411 Y1:390 Y2:414
council...

421
00:22:31,579 --> 00:22:33,240  X1:302 X2:418 Y1:390 Y2:420
president.

422
00:22:33,314 --> 00:22:35,009  X1:300 X2:419 Y1:390 Y2:417
Who, me?

423
00:22:35,083 --> 00:22:36,710  X1:302 X2:417 Y1:390 Y2:417
Oh, no. I...

424
00:22:36,784 --> 00:22:40,276  X1:226 X2:494 Y1:358 Y2:417
I don't know anything
about that stuff, Mr. M.

425
00:22:40,355 --> 00:22:42,516  X1:217 X2:503 Y1:358 Y2:420
I mean, besides,
that's Tracy Flick's thing.

426
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:44,023  X1:189 X2:530 Y1:390 Y2:420
She's always working so hard.

427
00:22:44,092 --> 00:22:46,117  X1:249 X2:470 Y1:358 Y2:420
Yeah. She's a real
go-getter, all right.

428
00:22:46,194 --> 00:22:48,059  X1:237 X2:481 Y1:390 Y2:420
And she's super nice.

429
00:22:48,129 --> 00:22:49,528  X1:294 X2:424 Y1:390 Y2:420
Yeah, yeah,

430
00:22:49,597 --> 00:22:51,531  X1:168 X2:554 Y1:390 Y2:420
but one person assured ofvictory

431
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:53,533  X1:160 X2:561 Y1:390 Y2:414
kind ofundermines the whole idea

432
00:22:53,601 --> 00:22:54,898  X1:181 X2:539 Y1:390 Y2:420
ofdemocracy, don'tyou think?

433
00:22:54,969 --> 00:22:55,958  X1:290 X2:432 Y1:390 Y2:416
But, Mr. M--

434
00:22:56,037 --> 00:22:57,971  X1:229 X2:492 Y1:358 Y2:420
I mean, that'd be more
like a dictatorship

435
00:22:58,039 --> 00:22:59,472  X1:270 X2:450 Y1:390 Y2:414
like we studied.

436
00:22:59,541 --> 00:23:00,473  X1:244 X2:478 Y1:390 Y2:417
But, Mr. M, there's--

437
00:23:00,542 --> 00:23:02,567  X1:183 X2:540 Y1:390 Y2:420
Paul, what's your favorite fruit?

438
00:23:02,644 --> 00:23:05,135  X1:327 X2:394 Y1:390 Y2:413
Pears.

439
00:23:05,213 --> 00:23:06,976  X1:265 X2:456 Y1:390 Y2:414
Pears. Good. OK.

440
00:23:07,048 --> 00:23:07,980  X1:303 X2:419 Y1:390 Y2:419
Let's say--

441
00:23:08,049 --> 00:23:10,074  X1:287 X2:432 Y1:390 Y2:417
Oh, no, wait.

442
00:23:10,151 --> 00:23:11,584  X1:316 X2:403 Y1:390 Y2:420
Apples.

443
00:23:11,653 --> 00:23:12,984  X1:316 X2:403 Y1:390 Y2:420
Apples.

444
00:23:13,054 --> 00:23:14,021  X1:334 X2:388 Y1:390 Y2:413
Fine.

445
00:23:14,088 --> 00:23:17,489  X1:225 X2:495 Y1:358 Y2:420
Let's say all you
ever knew were apples.

446
00:23:17,559 --> 00:23:20,494  X1:195 X2:524 Y1:390 Y2:420
Apples, apples, more apples.

447
00:23:20,562 --> 00:23:22,496  X1:224 X2:494 Y1:358 Y2:420
You might think apples
were pretty good,

448
00:23:22,564 --> 00:23:25,499  X1:225 X2:494 Y1:358 Y2:414
even ifyou got a rotten
one once in a while.

449
00:23:25,567 --> 00:23:27,000  X1:254 X2:467 Y1:390 Y2:420
But then one day...

450
00:23:27,068 --> 00:23:28,501  X1:256 X2:464 Y1:390 Y2:420
there's an orange.

451
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:30,504  X1:259 X2:459 Y1:358 Y2:414
And nowyou can
make a decision.

452
00:23:30,572 --> 00:23:32,005  X1:237 X2:486 Y1:390 Y2:420
Doyou want an apple

453
00:23:32,073 --> 00:23:34,007  X1:206 X2:514 Y1:390 Y2:420
or doyou want an orange?

454
00:23:34,075 --> 00:23:35,770  X1:254 X2:465 Y1:390 Y2:420
That's democracy.

455
00:23:35,843 --> 00:23:37,902  X1:253 X2:467 Y1:390 Y2:414
I also like bananas.

457
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,945  X1:280 X2:441 Y1:390 Y2:420
Exactly. Good.

458
00:23:41,015 --> 00:23:42,505  X1:244 X2:476 Y1:390 Y2:420
So what doyou say?

459
00:23:42,584 --> 00:23:45,451  X1:224 X2:496 Y1:358 Y2:420
Maybe it's time to give
a little something back.

460
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,010  X1:293 X2:429 Y1:390 Y2:414
How's that?

461
00:23:47,088 --> 00:23:48,521  X1:279 X2:442 Y1:390 Y2:414
I think that's...

462
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:50,421  X1:232 X2:490 Y1:358 Y2:420
No.Just a little higher.
A little higher.

463
00:23:50,491 --> 00:23:51,685  X1:299 X2:422 Y1:390 Y2:414
Is this OK?

464
00:23:51,759 --> 00:23:54,956  X1:195 X2:524 Y1:358 Y2:419
Eric, you can't put tape
on the outside ofthe poster.

465
00:23:55,029 --> 00:23:56,963  X1:250 X2:472 Y1:358 Y2:420
It goes on the back
ofthe poster.

466
00:23:57,031 --> 00:23:58,965  X1:232 X2:487 Y1:358 Y2:420
You betterjust take
the whole thing down

467
00:23:59,033 --> 00:24:00,466  X1:294 X2:426 Y1:390 Y2:414
and redo it.

470
00:24:17,452 --> 00:24:18,851  X1:285 X2:435 Y1:390 Y2:420
Oh, hi, Tracy.

471
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,046  X1:220 X2:500 Y1:390 Y2:420
Who putyou up to this?

472
00:24:20,121 --> 00:24:21,281  X1:243 X2:476 Y1:390 Y2:420
What doyou mean?

473
00:24:21,356 --> 00:24:22,482  X1:182 X2:536 Y1:390 Y2:420
Youjust woke up this morning

474
00:24:22,557 --> 00:24:24,855  X1:234 X2:486 Y1:358 Y2:420
and suddenly decided
to run for president?

475
00:24:24,926 --> 00:24:28,487  X1:224 X2:497 Y1:358 Y2:419
No. Um, no,
I just thought that, uh--

476
00:24:28,563 --> 00:24:29,689  X1:271 X2:449 Y1:390 Y2:420
Thought what?

477
00:24:29,764 --> 00:24:33,029  X1:200 X2:522 Y1:358 Y2:420
Well, I was talking to
Mr. McAllister about my leg

478
00:24:33,101 --> 00:24:35,501  X1:180 X2:541 Y1:358 Y2:420
and how I still want to do
something for the school and--

479
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:37,561  X1:259 X2:463 Y1:358 Y2:420
So Mr. McAllister
asked you to run.

480
00:24:37,639 --> 00:24:40,574  X1:216 X2:501 Y1:358 Y2:420
Well, um, I talked to him
and everything,

481
00:24:40,642 --> 00:24:42,007  X1:178 X2:543 Y1:390 Y2:420
but hejust said that he thought

482
00:24:42,076 --> 00:24:43,509  X1:226 X2:495 Y1:390 Y2:420
it would be a good idea

483
00:24:43,578 --> 00:24:45,876  X1:197 X2:523 Y1:358 Y2:417
and how there's all different
kinds offruits and, uh...

484
00:24:45,947 --> 00:24:48,245  X1:185 X2:536 Y1:390 Y2:420
It's nothing againstyou, Tracy.

485
00:24:48,316 --> 00:24:50,011  X1:226 X2:495 Y1:390 Y2:420
I mean, you're the best.

486
00:24:50,084 --> 00:24:52,018  X1:230 X2:492 Y1:390 Y2:420
Uh, I just thought, uh...

487
00:24:52,086 --> 00:24:53,018  X1:338 X2:381 Y1:390 Y2:413
OK.

488
00:24:53,087 --> 00:24:55,146  X1:226 X2:492 Y1:390 Y2:420
You're on, Mr. Popular.

489
00:24:57,025 --> 00:24:58,959  X1:204 X2:519 Y1:358 Y2:420
Tracy: You might think it
upset me that Paul Metzler

490
00:24:59,027 --> 00:25:00,460  X1:182 X2:539 Y1:390 Y2:420
had decided to run against me,

491
00:25:00,528 --> 00:25:02,962  X1:229 X2:490 Y1:358 Y2:414
but nothing could be
further from the truth.

492
00:25:03,031 --> 00:25:04,464  X1:183 X2:538 Y1:390 Y2:420
He was no competition for me.

493
00:25:04,532 --> 00:25:06,466  X1:185 X2:535 Y1:390 Y2:420
It was like apples and oranges.

I had to work
a little harder, that's all.

496

497
00:25:11,539 --> 00:25:12,767  X1:178 X2:540 Y1:390 Y2:420
They understand that elections

498
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,705  X1:184 X2:536 Y1:390 Y2:420

They know this countrywas built

501
00:25:17,545 --> 00:25:20,480  X1:235 X2:487 Y1:358 Y2:420

502
00:25:20,548 --> 00:25:22,482  X1:210 X2:510 Y1:358 Y2:414
and don't have everything
handed to them

506
00:25:30,058 --> 00:25:31,992  X1:231 X2:491 Y1:358 Y2:420
and give them trucks
on their 1 6th birthday

507
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:34,085  X1:202 X2:518 Y1:358 Y2:414

00:25:34,162 --> 00:25:36,357  X1:209 X2:511 Y1:358 Y2:420

have to work for anything.

00:27:16,992 --> 00:27:19,927  X1:216 X2:504 Y1:358 Y2:420
Tammy: It's not like
I'm a lesbian or anything.

546
00:27:19,995 --> 00:27:21,428  X1:201 X2:519 Y1:390 Y2:420
I'm attracted to the person.

547
00:27:21,497 --> 00:27:24,432  X1:208 X2:513 Y1:358 Y2:414
It'sjust that all the people
I've ever been attracted to

548
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:25,933  X1:253 X2:467 Y1:390 Y2:420
happen to be girls.

549
00:27:27,503 --> 00:27:28,936  X1:305 X2:416 Y1:390 Y2:416
Lisa, wait!

550
00:27:32,007 --> 00:27:32,939  X1:330 X2:390 Y1:390 Y2:419
Stop!

551
00:27:37,012 --> 00:27:37,944  X1:321 X2:399 Y1:390 Y2:414
What?

552
00:27:38,013 --> 00:27:39,446  X1:253 X2:467 Y1:390 Y2:420
Whereyou going?

553
00:27:39,515 --> 00:27:41,949  X1:241 X2:481 Y1:390 Y2:420
I'm not likeyou, OK?

554
00:27:42,017 --> 00:27:43,882  X1:243 X2:476 Y1:390 Y2:420
What doyou mean?

555
00:27:43,953 --> 00:27:45,443  X1:276 X2:444 Y1:390 Y2:420
I'm not a dyke.

556
00:27:45,521 --> 00:27:47,455  X1:233 X2:486 Y1:390 Y2:414
And we're not in love.

557
00:27:47,523 --> 00:27:49,457  X1:274 X2:445 Y1:390 Y2:419
We werejust...

558
00:27:49,525 --> 00:27:51,152  X1:271 X2:449 Y1:390 Y2:419
experimenting.

559
00:27:51,227 --> 00:27:53,957  X1:276 X2:444 Y1:390 Y2:420
(Engine Starts)

560
00:28:03,973 --> 00:28:07,409  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:358 Y2:414
Tammy: How can something
that seemed so true

561
00:28:07,476 --> 00:28:10,411  X1:216 X2:504 Y1:390 Y2:414
turn out to be such a lie?

562
00:28:15,985 --> 00:28:18,852  X1:222 X2:499 Y1:358 Y2:420
Lisa and I were destined
to be together.

563
00:28:18,921 --> 00:28:21,412  X1:187 X2:533 Y1:358 Y2:417
Ofall the people in the planet
who had ever lived,

564
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:23,424  X1:167 X2:552 Y1:390 Y2:414
somehow we'd found each other.

565
00:28:23,492 --> 00:28:25,426  X1:244 X2:477 Y1:390 Y2:414
It was like a miracle.

566
00:28:28,497 --> 00:28:30,431  X1:183 X2:536 Y1:390 Y2:420
We had so much fun together,

567
00:28:30,499 --> 00:28:32,433  X1:238 X2:481 Y1:358 Y2:420
like the time we ate
a bunch ofasparagus

568
00:28:32,501 --> 00:28:34,833  X1:191 X2:529 Y1:358 Y2:420
to see how long it takes
beforeyour pee smells funny.

569
00:28:34,904 --> 00:28:36,337  X1:325 X2:395 Y1:390 Y2:420
(Ding)

570
00:28:36,405 --> 00:28:37,929  X1:241 X2:479 Y1:390 Y2:420
It was very scientifiic.

571
00:28:38,007 --> 00:28:39,599  X1:209 X2:513 Y1:390 Y2:416
For me, it was 1 1 minutes.

572
00:28:39,675 --> 00:28:41,768  X1:258 X2:463 Y1:390 Y2:417
For her, it was 1 7.

573
00:28:43,012 --> 00:28:45,776  X1:201 X2:522 Y1:358 Y2:414
Every day I found a new way
to tell Lisa

574
00:28:45,848 --> 00:28:48,442  X1:233 X2:488 Y1:390 Y2:414
how much I loved her.

575
00:28:48,517 --> 00:28:50,007  X1:237 X2:490 Y1:390 Y2:420
''Ifyoudiedrightnow,

576
00:28:50,085 --> 00:28:53,020  X1:185 X2:541 Y1:358 Y2:420
I would throwmyselfunder
one ofmy dad's cement trucks

577
00:28:53,088 --> 00:28:55,886  X1:173 X2:553 Y1:390 Y2:420
andgetpouredintoyourtomb. ''

578
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:00,894  X1:233 X2:487 Y1:358 Y2:420
But itjust seemed
like the closerwe got,

579
00:29:00,963 --> 00:29:02,863  X1:209 X2:511 Y1:390 Y2:420
the more she pulled away.

580
00:29:02,932 --> 00:29:04,593  X1:275 X2:444 Y1:390 Y2:419
Areyou crazy?

581
00:29:04,667 --> 00:29:05,599  X1:321 X2:399 Y1:390 Y2:414
What?

582
00:29:05,668 --> 00:29:06,896  X1:256 X2:462 Y1:358 Y2:414
These are private.
These are for us.

583
00:29:06,969 --> 00:29:07,958  X1:339 X2:381 Y1:390 Y2:413
So?

584
00:29:08,037 --> 00:29:09,800  X1:254 X2:466 Y1:358 Y2:417
But other people
can see them, too.

585
00:29:09,872 --> 00:29:11,237  X1:292 X2:428 Y1:390 Y2:414
I don't care.

586
00:29:11,307 --> 00:29:12,899  X1:301 X2:418 Y1:390 Y2:417
Well, I do.

587
00:29:15,978 --> 00:29:18,913  X1:231 X2:488 Y1:358 Y2:420
Tammy: What did I do
to make her change?

588
00:29:20,482 --> 00:29:21,915  X1:221 X2:498 Y1:390 Y2:420
What's wrong with me?

589
00:29:24,987 --> 00:29:26,921  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:390 Y2:417
Sometimes when I'm sad,

590
00:29:26,989 --> 00:29:29,924  X1:254 X2:466 Y1:358 Y2:420
I sit and watch
the power station.

591
00:29:29,992 --> 00:29:33,428  X1:204 X2:514 Y1:358 Y2:417
They say ifyou lie between
2 ofthe main wires,

592
00:29:33,495 --> 00:29:35,429  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:390 Y2:420
your bodyjust evaporates.

593
00:29:35,497 --> 00:29:37,431  X1:251 X2:467 Y1:390 Y2:420
You become a gas.

594
00:29:37,499 --> 00:29:40,434  X1:250 X2:471 Y1:358 Y2:414
I wonderwhat that
would feel like.

595
00:29:47,509 --> 00:29:49,443  X1:259 X2:462 Y1:390 Y2:420
I don't know why,

596
00:29:49,511 --> 00:29:52,446  X1:225 X2:494 Y1:358 Y2:414
but Lisa decided
she wanted to hurt me.

597
00:29:52,514 --> 00:29:55,449  X1:165 X2:554 Y1:390 Y2:420
And she knew exactlywhat to do.

598
00:29:57,653 --> 00:29:59,951  X1:217 X2:505 Y1:358 Y2:420
Paul: I sure was surprised
the day Lisa Flanagan

599
00:30:00,022 --> 00:30:03,321  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:358 Y2:420
asked me for a ride home
and ended up blowing me.

600
00:30:04,526 --> 00:30:06,960  X1:202 X2:518 Y1:390 Y2:420
I've wanted this for so long.

601
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:10,630  X1:230 X2:490 Y1:390 Y2:417
I mean, life is so weird.

602
00:30:10,699 --> 00:30:13,463  X1:223 X2:499 Y1:358 Y2:420
First, Lisa has a big fiight
with my sister,

603
00:30:13,535 --> 00:30:17,301  X1:191 X2:529 Y1:358 Y2:420
and the next thing you know,
she's my girlfriend.

604
00:30:17,373 --> 00:30:19,967  X1:214 X2:506 Y1:358 Y2:420
Since Lisa knew all about
public relations and stuff,

605
00:30:20,042 --> 00:30:22,510  X1:229 X2:491 Y1:358 Y2:420
she offered to help me
with my campaign.

606
00:30:22,578 --> 00:30:24,478  X1:224 X2:495 Y1:390 Y2:420
We made a great team.

607
00:30:24,546 --> 00:30:27,481  X1:227 X2:493 Y1:358 Y2:420
It seemed so natural,
the two ofus together.

608
00:30:27,549 --> 00:30:29,483  X1:244 X2:477 Y1:390 Y2:414
It was like a miracle.

609
00:30:31,954 --> 00:30:34,479  X1:150 X2:571 Y1:390 Y2:420
My leg wasn't bugging me too much

610
00:30:34,556 --> 00:30:35,989  X1:193 X2:526 Y1:390 Y2:414
and the weatherwas so nice.

611
00:30:36,058 --> 00:30:37,491  X1:206 X2:511 Y1:390 Y2:420
And every day after school

612
00:30:37,559 --> 00:30:41,495  X1:175 X2:548 Y1:358 Y2:414
Lisa and I would go to her house
to fuck and have a hot tub.

613
00:31:01,016 --> 00:31:02,950  X1:218 X2:502 Y1:358 Y2:420
Tammy: Ifthat's the way
theywanted it,

614
00:31:03,018 --> 00:31:04,815  X1:249 X2:472 Y1:358 Y2:420
then that's the way
it was gonna be.

615
00:31:04,887 --> 00:31:07,447  X1:222 X2:500 Y1:358 Y2:420
But I wasn't going down
without a fiight.

616
00:31:07,523 --> 00:31:08,956  X1:308 X2:411 Y1:390 Y2:420
(Jingling)

617
00:31:14,029 --> 00:31:14,961  X1:282 X2:441 Y1:390 Y2:420
Paul: Tammy?

618
00:31:17,032 --> 00:31:19,364  X1:193 X2:527 Y1:390 Y2:420
Tammy, what areyou doing?

619
00:31:19,435 --> 00:31:21,460  X1:240 X2:478 Y1:358 Y2:420
You're the advisor.
You should stop her.

620
00:31:21,537 --> 00:31:23,402  X1:224 X2:496 Y1:358 Y2:420
She's not qualifiied.
She'sjust a sophomore.

621
00:31:23,472 --> 00:31:24,461  X1:249 X2:473 Y1:390 Y2:420
Did you know that?

622
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:26,269  X1:254 X2:465 Y1:358 Y2:420
Calm down, Tracy.
Just calm down.

623
00:31:26,342 --> 00:31:27,969  X1:201 X2:518 Y1:390 Y2:417
We can't both run, can we?

624
00:31:28,043 --> 00:31:29,340  X1:174 X2:547 Y1:390 Y2:417
I mean, we're brother and sister.

625
00:31:29,411 --> 00:31:30,503  X1:312 X2:409 Y1:390 Y2:413
Can we?

626
00:31:30,579 --> 00:31:32,547  X1:221 X2:500 Y1:358 Y2:414
It's a conflict ofinterest,
and Paul was fiirst.

627
00:31:32,614 --> 00:31:34,980  X1:188 X2:530 Y1:358 Y2:417
Anybodywho gets signatures
in on time can run,

628
00:31:35,050 --> 00:31:36,984  X1:246 X2:472 Y1:358 Y2:420
and she got in
just under the wire.

629
00:31:39,054 --> 00:31:41,284  X1:180 X2:538 Y1:390 Y2:414
These are a bunch ofburnouts.

630
00:31:41,357 --> 00:31:43,484  X1:239 X2:481 Y1:358 Y2:420
And what's this one?
It's illegible.

631
00:31:43,559 --> 00:31:44,890  X1:236 X2:485 Y1:390 Y2:414
I can't even read that.

632
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,985  X1:251 X2:467 Y1:390 Y2:414
That's Tim...Cobsa.

633
00:31:47,062 --> 00:31:49,496  X1:255 X2:464 Y1:358 Y2:420
She's doing this
to get back at me.

634
00:31:49,565 --> 00:31:50,497  X1:304 X2:418 Y1:390 Y2:414
Forwhat?

635
00:31:50,566 --> 00:31:53,000  X1:277 X2:444 Y1:390 Y2:419
I mean, atyou.

636
00:31:53,068 --> 00:31:54,501  X1:304 X2:418 Y1:390 Y2:414
Forwhat?

637
00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:56,435  X1:292 X2:427 Y1:390 Y2:414
Tim Cobsa?

638
00:31:56,505 --> 00:31:59,531  X1:195 X2:525 Y1:358 Y2:414
Tim Cobsa? Who's he?
I've never even heard ofhim.

639
00:31:59,608 --> 00:32:01,439  X1:210 X2:510 Y1:358 Y2:420
Look, why don't we
just forget about Tammy?

640
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:02,943  X1:155 X2:563 Y1:390 Y2:420
We'll have the assembly tomorrow.

641
00:32:03,012 --> 00:32:04,445  X1:153 X2:568 Y1:390 Y2:420
Everybody can make their speeches,

642
00:32:04,513 --> 00:32:06,947  X1:215 X2:504 Y1:358 Y2:420
and I'm sure everything's
gonna bejust fiine.

643
00:32:07,149 --> 00:32:07,945  X1:268 X2:451 Y1:390 Y2:420
Jim: Hey! Whee!

644
00:32:08,017 --> 00:32:10,451  X1:248 X2:471 Y1:358 Y2:420
Diane:Jim, don't.
You're scaring him.

645
00:32:10,519 --> 00:32:12,419  X1:271 X2:451 Y1:390 Y2:414
Nah. He likes it.

646
00:32:12,488 --> 00:32:13,455  X1:273 X2:449 Y1:390 Y2:414
Not that much.

647
00:32:13,522 --> 00:32:14,955  X1:230 X2:489 Y1:390 Y2:420
Jim: Around that time,

648
00:32:15,024 --> 00:32:16,958  X1:262 X2:460 Y1:358 Y2:420
Diane and I were
hanging out a lot

649
00:32:17,026 --> 00:32:18,254  X1:211 X2:509 Y1:390 Y2:420
at Linda Novotny's house,

650
00:32:18,327 --> 00:32:20,454  X1:179 X2:542 Y1:390 Y2:420
giving her our love and support

651
00:32:20,529 --> 00:32:24,056  X1:222 X2:498 Y1:358 Y2:420
and helping her make it
through a diffiicult time.

652
00:32:24,133 --> 00:32:26,465  X1:284 X2:435 Y1:390 Y2:420

00:32:29,038 --> 00:32:31,472  X1:172 X2:550 Y1:390 Y2:420
Diane reallywanted to have kids,

654
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:32,837  X1:291 X2:429 Y1:390 Y2:417
and so did I,

655
00:32:32,908 --> 00:32:35,433  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:358 Y2:420
but it seemed like there
was always a reason to wait:

656
00:32:35,511 --> 00:32:37,445  X1:264 X2:456 Y1:358 Y2:420
She had to fiinish
nursing school,

657
00:32:37,513 --> 00:32:38,980  X1:219 X2:502 Y1:390 Y2:420
I had to get my master's,

658
00:32:39,048 --> 00:32:41,983  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:358 Y2:420
we needed a new house,
we needed more money.

659
00:32:42,051 --> 00:32:44,295  X1:228 X2:494 Y1:358 Y2:420
Finally, wejust decided
to go for it.

660
00:32:44,429 --> 00:32:45,726  X1:261 X2:458 Y1:390 Y2:420
You gonna do it?

661
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:47,230  X1:261 X2:458 Y1:390 Y2:420
You gonna do it?

662
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:50,461  X1:222 X2:497 Y1:358 Y2:420
Jim: And for over a year,
we hadn't had any luck.

663
00:32:50,535 --> 00:32:52,969  X1:236 X2:484 Y1:390 Y2:413
Come on. Do it. Do it.

664
00:32:53,037 --> 00:32:54,902  X1:244 X2:478 Y1:390 Y2:420
Fill me up. Come on.

Fill me up.

667
00:32:58,476 --> 00:32:59,408  X1:299 X2:421 Y1:390 Y2:420
(Groaning)

668
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:07,416  X1:338 X2:381 Y1:390 Y2:413
OK.

669
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:13,923  X1:304 X2:415 Y1:390 Y2:420
Goodjob.

670
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,160  X1:273 X2:449 Y1:390 Y2:420
Linda: Say,Jim?

672
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:26,203  X1:236 X2:483 Y1:390 Y2:420
Jim, can you get this?

673
00:33:26,271 --> 00:33:27,431  X1:322 X2:398 Y1:390 Y2:413
I can't.

674
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:28,938  X1:275 X2:444 Y1:390 Y2:420
Oh, yeah, sure.

675
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:30,941  X1:226 X2:492 Y1:390 Y2:420
Just put it on the table.

676
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:31,941  X1:308 X2:410 Y1:390 Y2:420
All right.

677

678
00:33:36,447 --> 00:33:37,471  X1:205 X2:513 Y1:390 Y2:420
Jim: Without Dave around,

679
00:33:37,548 --> 00:33:39,448  X1:212 X2:511 Y1:358 Y2:414
Linda needed a lot ofhelp
around the house.

680
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:41,109  X1:195 X2:524 Y1:390 Y2:420
Where doyou want it, here?

681
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:42,117  X1:341 X2:381 Y1:390 Y2:413
No.

682
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:44,954  X1:277 X2:444 Y1:390 Y2:420
More this way.

683
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:48,116  X1:327 X2:395 Y1:390 Y2:413
Here?

684
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:50,524  X1:234 X2:487 Y1:390 Y2:420
Uh, yeah. That's good.

685
00:33:53,564 --> 00:33:56,897  X1:195 X2:525 Y1:358 Y2:414
Jim: I had always liked Linda,
but we'd never had a chance

686
00:33:56,968 --> 00:33:59,459  X1:256 X2:464 Y1:358 Y2:420
to spend any time
alone together.

687
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:01,562  X1:176 X2:544 Y1:390 Y2:420
Oughta warm you up a little bit.

688
00:34:01,639 --> 00:34:02,901  X1:255 X2:465 Y1:358 Y2:420
Now with Dave
out ofthe picture,

689
00:34:02,974 --> 00:34:04,908  X1:232 X2:489 Y1:358 Y2:420
I began to see what
an incredibly sensitive

690
00:34:04,976 --> 00:34:08,139  X1:206 X2:514 Y1:390 Y2:420
and giving person she was.

691
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:10,680  X1:245 X2:476 Y1:358 Y2:414
We got to be
kind oflike buddies.

692
00:34:10,748 --> 00:34:11,908  X1:208 X2:512 Y1:358 Y2:414
I even took her to the mall
one time

693
00:34:11,983 --> 00:34:14,008  X1:188 X2:530 Y1:390 Y2:420
while her carwas in the shop.

694
00:34:16,988 --> 00:34:18,512  X1:245 X2:474 Y1:390 Y2:420
What doyou think?

695
00:34:19,991 --> 00:34:21,686  X1:271 X2:448 Y1:390 Y2:420
You look great.

696
00:34:21,759 --> 00:34:24,421  X1:172 X2:549 Y1:390 Y2:420
I can't afford this stuffright now.

697
00:34:24,495 --> 00:34:26,326  X1:226 X2:492 Y1:358 Y2:420
Ah, come on.
You've had a hard year.

698
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:28,422  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:358 Y2:414
You're cooped up
all the time with the kid.

699
00:34:28,499 --> 00:34:29,898  X1:252 X2:469 Y1:390 Y2:420
Let go. Live a little.

700
00:34:29,968 --> 00:34:30,900  X1:302 X2:417 Y1:390 Y2:413
You sure?

701
00:34:30,969 --> 00:34:31,901  X1:327 X2:391 Y1:390 Y2:414
Yeah.

702
00:34:34,505 --> 00:34:36,439  X1:232 X2:489 Y1:390 Y2:420
So what doyou think?

703
00:34:36,507 --> 00:34:37,940  X1:227 X2:494 Y1:390 Y2:420
Should we get a room?

704
00:34:38,009 --> 00:34:39,442  X1:229 X2:491 Y1:390 Y2:420
Should we get a what?

705
00:34:52,523 --> 00:34:53,922  X1:262 X2:456 Y1:390 Y2:420
That's not funny.

706
00:34:53,992 --> 00:34:57,928  X1:154 X2:566 Y1:390 Y2:418
(Music Soundtrack Slows To A Halt)

708
00:35:01,966 --> 00:35:03,900  X1:289 X2:434 Y1:390 Y2:420
How'd it go?

709
00:35:03,968 --> 00:35:04,900  X1:334 X2:388 Y1:390 Y2:413
Fine.

710
00:35:04,969 --> 00:35:05,901  X1:292 X2:426 Y1:390 Y2:414
You know...

711
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:07,904  X1:223 X2:495 Y1:390 Y2:420
just went to Westerly's.

712
00:35:07,972 --> 00:35:09,837  X1:230 X2:493 Y1:390 Y2:420
Did you guys have fun?

713
00:35:11,476 --> 00:35:12,909  X1:331 X2:390 Y1:390 Y2:413
Um...

714
00:35:12,977 --> 00:35:13,909  X1:329 X2:390 Y1:390 Y2:420
yeah.

715
00:35:13,978 --> 00:35:16,572  X1:230 X2:491 Y1:390 Y2:420
No, I mean...you know.

716
00:35:16,647 --> 00:35:19,047  X1:321 X2:399 Y1:390 Y2:414
What?

717
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:21,415  X1:248 X2:470 Y1:390 Y2:420
Well, Linda's great,

718
00:35:21,486 --> 00:35:24,284  X1:198 X2:522 Y1:358 Y2:414
but she can be
a little bit much sometimes.

719
00:35:26,491 --> 00:35:27,822  X1:327 X2:391 Y1:390 Y2:414
Yeah.

720
00:35:27,892 --> 00:35:30,417  X1:261 X2:458 Y1:358 Y2:420
Oh, God.
Oh,just like that.

721
00:35:30,495 --> 00:35:31,462  X1:327 X2:391 Y1:390 Y2:414
Yeah.

727
00:35:41,506 --> 00:35:42,939  X1:283 X2:436 Y1:390 Y2:420
Just like that.

728

Just like that.

737
00:36:00,458 --> 00:36:03,188  X1:234 X2:488 Y1:358 Y2:414

739
00:36:05,463 --> 00:36:06,395  X1:272 X2:450 Y1:390 Y2:414
Harder! Harder!

742
00:36:13,471 --> 00:36:14,904  X1:221 X2:498 Y1:390 Y2:420
Jim: So like I was saying,

743
00:36:14,972 --> 00:36:16,940  X1:240 X2:481 Y1:358 Y2:420
things were going
prettywell in my life.

744
00:36:17,075 --> 00:36:19,407  X1:217 X2:504 Y1:358 Y2:420
That is, until things
started going all haywire

745
00:36:19,477 --> 00:36:20,910  X1:216 X2:502 Y1:390 Y2:414

748
00:36:27,485 --> 00:36:30,921  X1:195 X2:525 Y1:358 Y2:420
A vote forJerry Slavin is

761
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:10,391  X1:209 X2:512 Y1:358 Y2:417
Poet Henry David Thoreau
once wrote,

762
00:37:10,461 --> 00:37:12,725  X1:179 X2:541 Y1:390 Y2:420

763
00:37:12,797 --> 00:37:14,822  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:390 Y2:414

769
00:37:25,977 --> 00:37:28,411  X1:208 X2:512 Y1:390 Y2:420
I spoke with Eliza Ramirez,

770
00:37:28,479 --> 00:37:30,913  X1:242 X2:478 Y1:358 Y2:414
a freshman who said
she feels alienated

771
00:37:30,982 --> 00:37:32,506  X1:207 X2:512 Y1:390 Y2:414
from her own home room.

772
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:34,414  X1:140 X2:581 Y1:390 Y2:420
I spoke with sophomore Reggie Banks

773
00:37:34,485 --> 00:37:36,919  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:358 Y2:414

774
00:37:36,988 --> 00:37:38,888  X1:204 X2:514 Y1:358 Y2:420
and can't afford to buy him
enough spiral notebooks

775
00:37:38,956 --> 00:37:39,888  X1:278 X2:442 Y1:390 Y2:414
for his classes.

776

781
00:37:51,502 --> 00:37:54,437  X1:208 X2:512 Y1:358 Y2:420

782
00:37:54,505 --> 00:37:57,372  X1:194 X2:526 Y1:358 Y2:414
then you don't deserve to be
called adults but children

783
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:58,874  X1:170 X2:550 Y1:390 Y2:417
because that's what children are,

784
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:00,877  X1:163 X2:557 Y1:390 Y2:420

''As many ofyou know,

806
00:39:16,954 --> 00:39:18,888  X1:160 X2:560 Y1:390 Y2:420
I broke my leg pretty bad this year,

807
00:39:18,956 --> 00:39:20,890  X1:220 X2:501 Y1:358 Y2:414
and the experience
has made me reevaluate

808
00:39:20,958 --> 00:39:22,391  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:390 Y2:420
what I want to do with my life,

809
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:23,893  X1:225 X2:495 Y1:390 Y2:420

00:39:23,961 --> 00:39:25,394  X1:215 X2:504 Y1:390 Y2:420

811
00:39:25,463 --> 00:39:27,021  X1:183 X2:536 Y1:390 Y2:414
a school is more than a school.

812
00:39:27,098 --> 00:39:28,895  X1:195 X2:525 Y1:358 Y2:420
It's our second home,
where we spend all our time

813
00:39:28,966 --> 00:39:31,901  X1:225 X2:494 Y1:358 Y2:420

814
00:39:31,969 --> 00:39:33,903  X1:227 X2:493 Y1:358 Y2:420

everything it could be?

815
00:39:33,971 --> 00:39:36,906  X1:210 X2:511 Y1:358 Y2:420
I want our school to reach
its true potential.

00:39:36,974 --> 00:39:38,407  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:390 Y2:420

818
00:39:40,478 --> 00:39:42,412  X1:210 X2:512 Y1:358 Y2:414

819
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,415  X1:185 X2:536 Y1:358 Y2:420

pass against Westside

820
00:39:45,483 --> 00:39:47,417  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:358 Y2:420

852
00:41:15,971 --> 00:41:17,905  X1:223 X2:496 Y1:358 Y2:420

00:42:24,372 --> 00:42:26,897  X1:187 X2:534 Y1:390 Y2:414
I want her out ofthis election.

874
00:42:26,975 --> 00:42:29,000  X1:210 X2:513 Y1:358 Y2:420
I mean, getting everybody
all riled up like that.

875
00:42:29,077 --> 00:42:30,772  X1:241 X2:479 Y1:358 Y2:420
She is washed up,
you understand me?

876
00:42:30,845 --> 00:42:31,869  X1:278 X2:442 Y1:390 Y2:414
She's fiinished.

877
00:42:31,947 --> 00:42:33,608  X1:231 X2:490 Y1:358 Y2:414
Well, we can't throw
her out ofthe election

878
00:42:33,682 --> 00:42:35,411  X1:236 X2:484 Y1:358 Y2:420
just because we
don't like her speech.

879
00:42:35,483 --> 00:42:38,816  X1:221 X2:499 Y1:358 Y2:420
That's not what student
government is about.

880
00:42:38,887 --> 00:42:40,912  X1:234 X2:484 Y1:390 Y2:420
Yeah, yeah, whatever.

881
00:42:40,989 --> 00:42:42,456  X1:259 X2:462 Y1:390 Y2:417
Look, all I know is

882
00:42:42,524 --> 00:42:44,651  X1:236 X2:484 Y1:358 Y2:420
she's a troublemaker,
she's on my list.

883
00:42:44,726 --> 00:42:46,421  X1:255 X2:465 Y1:358 Y2:420
All we need to do
is send a message.

884
00:42:46,494 --> 00:42:50,590  X1:218 X2:502 Y1:358 Y2:420
So maybe, uh, we should
just suspend her.

885
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:56,532  X1:204 X2:516 Y1:358 Y2:420
That's it. 3 days,
she's suspended for 3 days.

886
00:43:00,408 --> 00:43:02,638  X1:199 X2:520 Y1:358 Y2:420
Tammy: Being suspended is
like getting a paid vacation.

887
00:43:02,711 --> 00:43:04,941  X1:252 X2:468 Y1:358 Y2:420
Why do they think
it's a punishment?

888
00:43:05,013 --> 00:43:07,004  X1:253 X2:469 Y1:358 Y2:420
It's likeyour dog
pees on the carpet

889
00:43:07,082 --> 00:43:08,811  X1:218 X2:502 Y1:390 Y2:420
and you give him a treat.

890
00:43:08,883 --> 00:43:10,783  X1:223 X2:497 Y1:358 Y2:420
Then you get in trouble
for skipping school.

891
00:43:10,852 --> 00:43:12,581  X1:285 X2:436 Y1:390 Y2:420
It's so stupid.

892
00:43:12,654 --> 00:43:14,679  X1:252 X2:470 Y1:358 Y2:414
Hendricks told me,
''One more time''

893
00:43:14,756 --> 00:43:18,157  X1:235 X2:484 Y1:358 Y2:420
and I'd be expelled.
Sounded good to me.

894
00:43:36,044 --> 00:43:37,204  X1:270 X2:449 Y1:390 Y2:418
(Whistle Blows)

895
00:43:43,051 --> 00:43:47,078  X1:300 X2:419 Y1:390 Y2:418
(Bell Tolls)

896
00:44:17,986 --> 00:44:20,750  X1:273 X2:446 Y1:390 Y2:420
Oh, hi, Tammy.

897
00:44:22,590 --> 00:44:23,921  X1:247 X2:473 Y1:390 Y2:420
What doyou want?

898
00:44:23,992 --> 00:44:26,017  X1:175 X2:543 Y1:390 Y2:420
Well, I went to all your teachers

899
00:44:26,094 --> 00:44:27,459  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:390 Y2:420
and gotyour assignments foryou.

900
00:44:27,529 --> 00:44:29,963  X1:203 X2:517 Y1:390 Y2:420
I--I just thought, you know,

901
00:44:30,031 --> 00:44:30,998  X1:198 X2:523 Y1:390 Y2:420
last timeyou got suspended

902
00:44:31,066 --> 00:44:31,998  X1:236 X2:483 Y1:390 Y2:420
you fell so far behind,

903
00:44:32,067 --> 00:44:32,999  X1:238 X2:482 Y1:390 Y2:420
and I just didn't want

904
00:44:33,068 --> 00:44:34,467  X1:214 X2:506 Y1:390 Y2:420
to see that happen again.

905
00:44:34,536 --> 00:44:36,504  X1:207 X2:511 Y1:390 Y2:417
Thanks, Paul. Thanks a lot.

906
00:44:36,571 --> 00:44:38,471  X1:279 X2:440 Y1:390 Y2:414
Sure. You bet.

907
00:44:40,208 --> 00:44:41,766  X1:179 X2:544 Y1:390 Y2:420
Now could you leave me alone?

908
00:44:41,843 --> 00:44:44,209  X1:279 X2:441 Y1:390 Y2:420
Oh, yeah. Um,

909
00:44:44,279 --> 00:44:47,009  X1:246 X2:474 Y1:358 Y2:420
Tammy, there'sjust
one other thing.

910
00:44:47,082 --> 00:44:49,448  X1:256 X2:464 Y1:358 Y2:417
You know all
this election stuff,

911
00:44:49,517 --> 00:44:51,451  X1:233 X2:487 Y1:358 Y2:420
'cause everybody's
saying it's reallyweird

912
00:44:51,519 --> 00:44:52,486  X1:181 X2:539 Y1:390 Y2:420
thatyou're running against me

913
00:44:52,554 --> 00:44:54,249  X1:233 X2:487 Y1:358 Y2:414
and everything,
and it is kind ofweird.

914
00:44:54,322 --> 00:44:56,756  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:358 Y2:420
You haven't really told me
whyyou're doing it

915
00:44:56,825 --> 00:44:58,349  X1:252 X2:468 Y1:358 Y2:417
and you didn't
tell me in advance,

916
00:44:58,426 --> 00:45:01,486  X1:234 X2:486 Y1:358 Y2:420
but that's OK.
I respectyour privacy,

917
00:45:01,563 --> 00:45:03,963  X1:250 X2:471 Y1:358 Y2:419
it'sjust...
I wantyou to know

918
00:45:04,032 --> 00:45:05,329  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:390 Y2:417
that no matterwho wins,

919
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,595  X1:221 X2:499 Y1:364 Y2:420
you or me,
there's no hard feelings.

920
00:45:07,669 --> 00:45:10,103  X1:252 X2:468 Y1:358 Y2:417
We're still brother
and sister, OK,

921
00:45:10,171 --> 00:45:11,160  X1:193 X2:526 Y1:390 Y2:420
even though you're adopted,

922
00:45:11,239 --> 00:45:15,005  X1:177 X2:543 Y1:390 Y2:420
'cause I hopeyou feel the same.

923
00:45:18,847 --> 00:45:20,712  X1:228 X2:490 Y1:358 Y2:420
Tracy: What happened
at the speeches

924
00:45:20,782 --> 00:45:22,977  X1:173 X2:545 Y1:390 Y2:420
was an unconscionable travesty.

925
00:45:23,051 --> 00:45:24,780  X1:175 X2:546 Y1:390 Y2:420
That little bitch Tammy Metzler

926
00:45:24,853 --> 00:45:26,184  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:390 Y2:414
wanted to make a fool out ofme.

927
00:45:26,254 --> 00:45:28,779  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:390 Y2:420
Well, it wasn't gonna work.

928
00:45:28,857 --> 00:45:31,519  X1:170 X2:551 Y1:358 Y2:420
Ifall those students
who cheered forTammy Metzler

929
00:45:31,593 --> 00:45:33,754  X1:243 X2:476 Y1:358 Y2:417
only knew how hard
I worked for Carver,

930
00:45:33,828 --> 00:45:36,160  X1:189 X2:532 Y1:358 Y2:420
like all the late nights
I spend at theyearbook offiice

931
00:45:36,231 --> 00:45:38,290  X1:217 X2:502 Y1:358 Y2:420
just to give them
their stinking memories.

932
00:45:43,705 --> 00:45:46,435  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:358 Y2:420
One ofmy duties was
to clean up the group photos.

933
00:45:46,508 --> 00:45:50,000  X1:226 X2:493 Y1:358 Y2:414
It was a cinch
with our new software.

934
00:45:51,679 --> 00:45:54,978  X1:217 X2:504 Y1:390 Y2:420
People are so ungrateful.

937
00:47:26,941 --> 00:47:29,136  X1:276 X2:443 Y1:390 Y2:420
Aaagh! Aaagh!

938
00:47:29,210 --> 00:47:32,611  X1:319 X2:400 Y1:390 Y2:420
Aaagh!

Jim: The day before the election

943
00:49:26,388 --> 00:49:30,017  X1:212 X2:508 Y1:358 Y2:420
was when things started
to get really complicated.

944
00:49:30,092 --> 00:49:31,616  X1:243 X2:476 Y1:390 Y2:420
There's your culprit.

945
00:49:31,693 --> 00:49:35,094  X1:187 X2:537 Y1:358 Y2:420
Linda had asked me to stop by
on myway to school

946
00:49:35,164 --> 00:49:38,759  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:358 Y2:420
to help her out with
a little plumbing problem.

947
00:49:38,834 --> 00:49:41,598  X1:157 X2:565 Y1:390 Y2:420
Did you know Dave's a bed-wetter?

948
00:49:41,670 --> 00:49:45,299  X1:194 X2:528 Y1:390 Y2:417
No. No, I--I didn't know that.

949
00:49:45,374 --> 00:49:47,501  X1:238 X2:484 Y1:358 Y2:420
All his life.
He's tried everything.

950
00:49:51,146 --> 00:49:53,842  X1:214 X2:508 Y1:390 Y2:420
Is that still running clear?

951
00:49:53,916 --> 00:49:54,940  X1:327 X2:391 Y1:390 Y2:414
Yeah.

952
00:49:55,017 --> 00:49:56,780  X1:205 X2:516 Y1:390 Y2:414
Better let it run for a while.

953
00:49:56,852 --> 00:49:58,786  X1:338 X2:381 Y1:390 Y2:413
OK.

954
00:49:58,854 --> 00:50:01,152  X1:308 X2:411 Y1:390 Y2:417
Oh, wait.

955
00:50:01,223 --> 00:50:04,522  X1:233 X2:489 Y1:390 Y2:414
Here. This one's clean.

956
00:50:08,163 --> 00:50:10,131  X1:257 X2:465 Y1:358 Y2:420
I guess you better
get to work, huh?

957
00:50:10,199 --> 00:50:11,791  X1:236 X2:482 Y1:390 Y2:420
You're gonna be late.

958
00:50:11,867 --> 00:50:14,358  X1:327 X2:391 Y1:390 Y2:414
Yeah.

959
00:50:24,446 --> 00:50:27,006  X1:271 X2:448 Y1:358 Y2:420

Thankyou,Jim.

thatjust happened.

961
00:50:42,364 --> 00:50:44,355  X1:214 X2:507 Y1:390 Y2:420
Neither ofus expected it.

962
00:50:44,433 --> 00:50:46,162  X1:221 X2:500 Y1:390 Y2:420
Neither ofus planned it.

963
00:50:46,235 --> 00:50:49,762  X1:188 X2:535 Y1:358 Y2:420
But once we started, we knew
there was no turning back.

964
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:53,535  X1:268 X2:453 Y1:390 Y2:414
It was a miracle.

965
00:50:53,609 --> 00:50:55,474  X1:314 X2:405 Y1:390 Y2:420
Oh,Jim.

966
00:51:06,421 --> 00:51:09,049  X1:203 X2:518 Y1:390 Y2:420
Hey, take me to that motel,

967
00:51:09,124 --> 00:51:10,250  X1:266 X2:454 Y1:390 Y2:420

968
00:51:10,325 --> 00:51:12,020  X1:328 X2:395 Y1:390 Y2:413
Now?

969
00:51:12,094 --> 00:51:13,857  X1:211 X2:511 Y1:390 Y2:420
Um, come by after school.

970
00:51:13,929 --> 00:51:15,396  X1:200 X2:521 Y1:390 Y2:420
I'll leave Darryl with a sitter.

971
00:51:15,464 --> 00:51:18,365  X1:306 X2:413 Y1:390 Y2:414
Oh. 3:25.

972
00:51:18,433 --> 00:51:20,458  X1:305 X2:414 Y1:390 Y2:416
OK, 3:25.

975
00:51:30,879 --> 00:51:32,744  X1:229 X2:493 Y1:358 Y2:417
between Linda and me
was too real,

976
00:51:32,814 --> 00:51:34,679  X1:235 X2:484 Y1:390 Y2:420
too powerful to deny.

977
00:51:34,750 --> 00:51:36,411  X1:214 X2:508 Y1:390 Y2:420

978
00:51:36,485 --> 00:51:39,113  X1:251 X2:469 Y1:390 Y2:414
I felt free and alive.

00:52:07,949 --> 00:52:10,611  X1:272 X2:449 Y1:358 Y2:420
It's not fair,
it'sjust not fair.

982
00:52:10,686 --> 00:52:12,153  X1:203 X2:520 Y1:390 Y2:420
I just don't think somebody

983
00:52:12,220 --> 00:52:13,983  X1:239 X2:479 Y1:358 Y2:420
would do something
like that on purpose.

984
00:52:14,056 --> 00:52:16,354  X1:267 X2:454 Y1:358 Y2:417
It must be some
sort ofmistake,

985
00:52:16,425 --> 00:52:18,416  X1:214 X2:506 Y1:390 Y2:420
like a maintenance thing.

986
00:52:18,493 --> 00:52:21,519  X1:250 X2:467 Y1:358 Y2:420
Jim, where the hell
haveyou been?

987
00:52:21,596 --> 00:52:24,997  X1:250 X2:473 Y1:358 Y2:420
Nowhere. I--I don't
have any classes

988
00:52:25,067 --> 00:52:25,999  X1:256 X2:464 Y1:390 Y2:420
till second period.

989
00:52:26,068 --> 00:52:27,194  X1:213 X2:506 Y1:390 Y2:420
Well, I tried you at home,

990
00:52:27,269 --> 00:52:29,100  X1:183 X2:537 Y1:390 Y2:420
and we've got a situation here.

991
00:52:29,171 --> 00:52:30,536  X1:223 X2:497 Y1:358 Y2:417
If Paul loses
this election tomorrow,

992
00:52:30,605 --> 00:52:31,799  X1:199 X2:522 Y1:390 Y2:414
there has to be another one

993
00:52:31,873 --> 00:52:33,101  X1:284 X2:435 Y1:390 Y2:420
with posters.

994
00:52:33,175 --> 00:52:35,109  X1:155 X2:564 Y1:390 Y2:420
Somebody tore down their posters.

995
00:52:35,177 --> 00:52:36,735  X1:250 X2:469 Y1:358 Y2:420
Those posters cost
us a lot ofmoney,

996
00:52:36,812 --> 00:52:37,972  X1:247 X2:473 Y1:358 Y2:420
and there's no time
to make any more.

997
00:52:38,046 --> 00:52:39,479  X1:249 X2:471 Y1:358 Y2:414
All right, we'll get
to the bottom ofit.

998
00:52:39,548 --> 00:52:41,311  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:358 Y2:414
We still have some extra ones,
don't we?

999
00:52:41,383 --> 00:52:42,714  X1:182 X2:540 Y1:390 Y2:420
Maybe we couldjust use those.

1000
00:52:42,784 --> 00:52:43,716  X1:278 X2:443 Y1:390 Y2:419
It was Tammy.

1001
00:52:43,785 --> 00:52:44,717  X1:256 X2:462 Y1:390 Y2:414
That's who it was.

1002
00:52:44,786 --> 00:52:46,777  X1:230 X2:490 Y1:390 Y2:420
Oh, no. Hey, like I said,

1003
00:52:46,855 --> 00:52:48,413  X1:243 X2:477 Y1:358 Y2:420
shejust wouldn't do
something like that.

1004
00:52:48,490 --> 00:52:50,117  X1:175 X2:544 Y1:390 Y2:420
Well, that speech that she gave,

1005
00:52:50,192 --> 00:52:51,489  X1:215 X2:505 Y1:390 Y2:420
you know, it was pretty--

1006
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:53,653  X1:266 X2:454 Y1:390 Y2:414
It was out there.

1007
00:52:53,729 --> 00:52:55,026  X1:249 X2:471 Y1:358 Y2:414
But we'll get
to the bottom ofit.

1008
00:52:55,097 --> 00:52:57,497  X1:208 X2:512 Y1:390 Y2:420
I wantyou two to go back,

1009
00:52:57,566 --> 00:52:59,500  X1:157 X2:564 Y1:390 Y2:420
I wantyou to focus on your studies.

1010
00:52:59,568 --> 00:53:02,401  X1:212 X2:510 Y1:358 Y2:420
Mr. McAllisterwill handle
the whole thing.

1011
00:53:02,471 --> 00:53:04,496  X1:299 X2:423 Y1:390 Y2:420
Right,Jim?

1012
00:53:04,573 --> 00:53:08,532  X1:229 X2:490 Y1:358 Y2:420
What's that? Oh, yeah.
Sure, yeah, you bet.

1013
00:53:17,152 --> 00:53:19,211  X1:324 X2:394 Y1:390 Y2:419
Tracy.

1014
00:53:22,491 --> 00:53:25,483  X1:254 X2:465 Y1:390 Y2:419
Tracy, come on in.

1015
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:27,994  X1:205 X2:515 Y1:390 Y2:420
Close the door behind you.

1016
00:53:33,835 --> 00:53:35,962  X1:293 X2:428 Y1:390 Y2:413
Have a seat.

1017
00:53:39,775 --> 00:53:43,302  X1:262 X2:460 Y1:358 Y2:420
I guess you know
whyyou're here.

1018
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:46,908  X1:224 X2:496 Y1:390 Y2:420
Ifit's about the posters,

1019
00:53:46,982 --> 00:53:48,176  X1:266 X2:455 Y1:390 Y2:414
I think it's awful.

1020
00:53:48,250 --> 00:53:50,115  X1:242 X2:479 Y1:390 Y2:420
I think it's a travesty.

1021
00:53:50,185 --> 00:53:51,584  X1:276 X2:444 Y1:390 Y2:420
Travesty, huh?

1022
00:53:51,653 --> 00:53:54,918  X1:223 X2:495 Y1:390 Y2:420
Well, that's interesting,

1023
00:53:54,990 --> 00:53:57,254  X1:213 X2:508 Y1:390 Y2:420
because I thinkyou did it.

1024
00:53:57,325 --> 00:53:59,520  X1:321 X2:399 Y1:390 Y2:414
What?

1025
00:54:01,062 --> 00:54:03,121  X1:232 X2:487 Y1:390 Y2:419
Areyou accusing me?

1026
00:54:03,198 --> 00:54:04,722  X1:251 X2:468 Y1:390 Y2:413
You're not serious.

1027
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:06,631  X1:224 X2:496 Y1:358 Y2:420
Mr. McAllister,
we've worked together

1028
00:54:06,701 --> 00:54:08,965  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:390 Y2:420
on the S.G.A. for 3 solid years.

1029
00:54:09,037 --> 00:54:11,062  X1:194 X2:529 Y1:358 Y2:414
Besides, my own best banner
was torn down.

1030
00:54:11,139 --> 00:54:12,470  X1:257 X2:465 Y1:390 Y2:417
Did I do that, too?

1031
00:54:12,541 --> 00:54:13,940  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:390 Y2:419
Wereyou orwereyou not

1032
00:54:14,009 --> 00:54:15,943  X1:153 X2:567 Y1:390 Y2:420
working in the Looking Glass Offiice

1033
00:54:16,011 --> 00:54:16,943  X1:250 X2:471 Y1:390 Y2:414
over the weekend?

1034
00:54:17,012 --> 00:54:20,743  X1:236 X2:486 Y1:358 Y2:413
I was. So?
Mr. Paterno let me in.

1035
00:54:20,816 --> 00:54:23,114  X1:233 X2:488 Y1:358 Y2:420
As you know, with my
many responsibilities,

1036
00:54:23,185 --> 00:54:24,652  X1:228 X2:493 Y1:358 Y2:414
I often have to come in
on the weekend.

1037
00:54:24,719 --> 00:54:26,744  X1:178 X2:540 Y1:390 Y2:420
And I have permission to do so.

1038
00:54:26,822 --> 00:54:29,552  X1:251 X2:471 Y1:358 Y2:414
But I left very early,
around 6:30.

1039
00:54:30,792 --> 00:54:34,558  X1:295 X2:427 Y1:390 Y2:413
6:30. 6:30?

1040
00:54:34,629 --> 00:54:37,223  X1:193 X2:528 Y1:358 Y2:420
How doyou know what time
the posters were torn down?

1041
00:54:37,299 --> 00:54:39,961  X1:254 X2:467 Y1:390 Y2:420
I don't. I just know

1042
00:54:40,035 --> 00:54:41,559  X1:173 X2:546 Y1:390 Y2:420
that theywere there when I left.

1043
00:54:41,636 --> 00:54:44,036  X1:234 X2:487 Y1:358 Y2:417
I'm giving you helpful
information, that's all.

1044
00:54:44,105 --> 00:54:45,094  X1:241 X2:480 Y1:358 Y2:420
You know, instead
ofwasting your time

1045
00:54:45,173 --> 00:54:46,162  X1:258 X2:462 Y1:390 Y2:419
interrogating me,

1046
00:54:47,501 --> 00:54:48,297  X1:225 X2:495 Y1:390 Y2:414
we should be out there

1047
00:54:48,368 --> 00:54:49,528  X1:249 X2:471 Y1:358 Y2:414
trying to fiigure out
who did this.

1048
00:54:49,603 --> 00:54:51,798  X1:301 X2:419 Y1:390 Y2:419
OK, Tracy.

1049
00:54:51,872 --> 00:54:53,499  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:390 Y2:420
Who doyou think did it?

1050
00:54:53,573 --> 00:54:55,473  X1:182 X2:538 Y1:390 Y2:420
Whom should we interrogate?

1051
00:54:55,542 --> 00:54:57,271  X1:250 X2:468 Y1:390 Y2:417
Well, I don't know.

1052
00:54:57,344 --> 00:54:58,777  X1:247 X2:473 Y1:358 Y2:420
You know, it could
have been anybody.

1053
00:54:58,845 --> 00:55:01,245  X1:210 X2:510 Y1:358 Y2:417
There's a lot ofsubversive
elements here at Carver,

1054
00:55:01,315 --> 00:55:04,944  X1:172 X2:549 Y1:358 Y2:420
like RickThiessen or
Kevin Speck and those burnouts.

1055
00:55:05,018 --> 00:55:06,110  X1:176 X2:545 Y1:390 Y2:420
Orwhat about Tammy Metzler?

1056
00:55:06,186 --> 00:55:07,153  X1:223 X2:497 Y1:390 Y2:420
I mean, herwhole thing

1057
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:09,484  X1:182 X2:539 Y1:390 Y2:420
is being anti-this and anti-that.

1058
00:55:10,991 --> 00:55:14,188  X1:237 X2:482 Y1:358 Y2:419
Tracy, you're
a very intelligent girl.

1059
00:55:14,261 --> 00:55:17,162  X1:246 X2:474 Y1:358 Y2:420
You have a lot of
admirable qualities.

1060
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:19,130  X1:185 X2:536 Y1:390 Y2:420
But one day maybeyou'll learn

1061
00:55:19,199 --> 00:55:20,257  X1:263 X2:457 Y1:390 Y2:420
that being smart

1062
00:55:20,334 --> 00:55:22,962  X1:221 X2:499 Y1:358 Y2:420
and doing whateveryou
need to do to get ahead

1063
00:55:23,036 --> 00:55:24,628  X1:257 X2:463 Y1:358 Y2:420
and, yes, stepping
on other people

1064
00:55:24,705 --> 00:55:26,002  X1:287 X2:432 Y1:390 Y2:420
to get there,

1065
00:55:26,073 --> 00:55:29,804  X1:222 X2:498 Y1:358 Y2:414
well, there's a whole lot
more to life than that.

1066
00:55:29,876 --> 00:55:32,504  X1:228 X2:491 Y1:358 Y2:420
And, in the end, you're
only cheating yourself.

1067
00:55:33,714 --> 00:55:35,909  X1:203 X2:516 Y1:390 Y2:420
Why areyou lecturing me?

1068
00:55:35,983 --> 00:55:40,579  X1:227 X2:492 Y1:358 Y2:420
This isn't the time or
the place to get into it.

1069
00:55:40,654 --> 00:55:42,952  X1:239 X2:481 Y1:358 Y2:420
But there is,
forjust one example,

1070
00:55:43,023 --> 00:55:45,014  X1:160 X2:561 Y1:390 Y2:420
a certain former colleague ofmine

1071
00:55:45,092 --> 00:55:48,789  X1:188 X2:530 Y1:358 Y2:414
who made a very big mistake,
a life mistake.

1072
00:55:48,862 --> 00:55:50,295  X1:229 X2:490 Y1:358 Y2:417
Now, I think
the lesson here is that,

1073
00:55:50,364 --> 00:55:54,095  X1:233 X2:486 Y1:358 Y2:414
old oryoung,
we all make mistakes.

1074
00:55:54,167 --> 00:55:56,032  X1:237 X2:482 Y1:358 Y2:417
And we have to learn
that our actions,

1075
00:55:56,103 --> 00:56:01,200  X1:230 X2:490 Y1:358 Y2:420
all ofthem, can carry
serious consequences.

1076
00:56:01,274 --> 00:56:04,539  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:358 Y2:420
Mm-hmm. I don't know
whatyou're referring to,

1077
00:56:04,611 --> 00:56:07,307  X1:245 X2:476 Y1:358 Y2:420
but maybe ifcertain
older, wiser people

1078
00:56:07,381 --> 00:56:09,372  X1:163 X2:557 Y1:390 Y2:414
hadn't acted like such little babies

1079
00:56:09,449 --> 00:56:10,609  X1:236 X2:484 Y1:390 Y2:420
and gotten so mushy,

1080
00:56:10,684 --> 00:56:12,709  X1:187 X2:533 Y1:390 Y2:420
then everything would be OK.

1081
00:56:12,786 --> 00:56:15,277  X1:227 X2:496 Y1:390 Y2:420
I agree, and I also think

1082
00:56:15,355 --> 00:56:17,186  X1:152 X2:569 Y1:390 Y2:420
that certain young and naive people

1083
00:56:17,257 --> 00:56:19,248  X1:185 X2:536 Y1:390 Y2:420
need to thank their lucky stars

1084
00:56:19,326 --> 00:56:21,089  X1:215 X2:504 Y1:390 Y2:420
and be very, very grateful

1085
00:56:21,161 --> 00:56:23,322  X1:176 X2:545 Y1:390 Y2:414
the entire school didn't fiind out

1086
00:56:23,397 --> 00:56:24,796  X1:204 X2:516 Y1:390 Y2:414
about certain indiscretions

1087
00:56:24,865 --> 00:56:27,333  X1:243 X2:476 Y1:358 Y2:420
that could've ruined
their reputations

1088
00:56:27,401 --> 00:56:30,461  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:358 Y2:414
and their chances
to win certain elections.

1089
00:56:30,537 --> 00:56:32,402  X1:239 X2:480 Y1:358 Y2:420
And I think
certain older people,

1090
00:56:32,472 --> 00:56:34,406  X1:200 X2:521 Y1:390 Y2:420
likeyou and your colleague,

1091
00:56:34,474 --> 00:56:36,408  X1:237 X2:483 Y1:358 Y2:417
shouldn't be letching
after their students,

1092
00:56:36,476 --> 00:56:37,465  X1:185 X2:533 Y1:390 Y2:420
especiallywhen some ofthem

1093
00:56:37,544 --> 00:56:39,375  X1:209 X2:510 Y1:358 Y2:419
can't even get
their own wives pregnant,

1094
00:56:39,446 --> 00:56:41,175  X1:181 X2:539 Y1:390 Y2:420
and they certainly shouldn't be

1095
00:56:41,248 --> 00:56:43,682  X1:177 X2:543 Y1:390 Y2:420
making slanderous accusations,

1096
00:56:43,750 --> 00:56:45,911  X1:183 X2:536 Y1:358 Y2:420
especiallywhen certain
young, naive people's mothers

1097
00:56:45,986 --> 00:56:47,317  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:390 Y2:420
are paralegal secretaries

1098
00:56:47,387 --> 00:56:48,581  X1:197 X2:522 Y1:390 Y2:420
at the city's biggest law fiirm

1099
00:56:48,655 --> 00:56:50,953  X1:246 X2:476 Y1:358 Y2:414
and have won many
successful lawsuits.

1100
00:56:51,024 --> 00:56:53,492  X1:217 X2:502 Y1:358 Y2:420
And ifyou want to keep
questioning me like this,

1101
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:56,688  X1:189 X2:529 Y1:358 Y2:419
I won't continue
without my attorney present.

1103
00:57:01,668 --> 00:57:03,898  X1:227 X2:491 Y1:358 Y2:414
You wanted to see me,
Mr. McAllister?

1104
00:57:03,970 --> 00:57:06,234  X1:210 X2:508 Y1:390 Y2:420
Just wait outside, Tammy.

1105
00:57:06,306 --> 00:57:09,241  X1:251 X2:469 Y1:358 Y2:420
OK, but is this
about the posters?

1106
00:57:09,309 --> 00:57:11,937  X1:260 X2:458 Y1:358 Y2:420
Possibly. Please,
just wait outside.

1107
00:57:12,012 --> 00:57:15,277  X1:182 X2:538 Y1:390 Y2:417
OK, because I know who did it.

1108
00:57:15,348 --> 00:57:18,181  X1:234 X2:485 Y1:390 Y2:420
So, I'll just be outside.

1109
00:57:21,721 --> 00:57:23,052  X1:211 X2:510 Y1:390 Y2:420
Don't go anywhere, Tracy.

1110
00:57:23,123 --> 00:57:25,318  X1:213 X2:506 Y1:390 Y2:420
Tammy, come on in here.

1111
00:57:26,827 --> 00:57:29,091  X1:228 X2:491 Y1:390 Y2:420
This ought to be good.

1112
00:57:31,965 --> 00:57:34,126  X1:238 X2:482 Y1:358 Y2:420
So, what doyou have
to tell me, Tammy?

1113
00:57:34,201 --> 00:57:36,533  X1:219 X2:500 Y1:390 Y2:417
Well, this is hard for me,

1114
00:57:36,603 --> 00:57:38,730  X1:223 X2:498 Y1:358 Y2:420
but I think it's
important to be honest,

1115
00:57:38,805 --> 00:57:39,931  X1:299 X2:421 Y1:390 Y2:420

1116
00:57:40,006 --> 00:57:41,735  X1:214 X2:506 Y1:390 Y2:420
Yeah. What is it, Tammy?

1117
00:57:41,808 --> 00:57:46,939  X1:185 X2:533 Y1:358 Y2:420
I did it. I'm the one
who tore down Paul's posters.

1118
00:57:47,013 --> 00:57:49,481  X1:321 X2:400 Y1:390 Y2:414
I did it.

1119
00:57:49,549 --> 00:57:50,948  X1:243 X2:477 Y1:390 Y2:420
When did you do it?

1120
00:57:51,017 --> 00:57:53,747  X1:251 X2:468 Y1:358 Y2:420

1122
00:57:57,691 --> 00:57:59,056  X1:272 X2:450 Y1:390 Y2:419

1123
00:57:59,126 --> 00:58:00,957  X1:284 X2:435 Y1:390 Y2:414
Which door?

1124
00:58:01,027 --> 00:58:03,655  X1:246 X2:473 Y1:358 Y2:414
I don't know.
All I know is I did it.

1125
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:05,664  X1:217 X2:502 Y1:390 Y2:420

1126
00:58:05,732 --> 00:58:07,393  X1:289 X2:431 Y1:390 Y2:420
I have proof.

1131
00:58:35,128 --> 00:58:36,561  X1:333 X2:387 Y1:390 Y2:413

1132
00:58:36,630 --> 00:58:38,655  X1:171 X2:551 Y1:390 Y2:420
Looks like today's your lucky day.

1133
00:58:38,732 --> 00:58:39,994  X1:245 X2:474 Y1:390 Y2:414

1134
00:58:40,066 --> 00:58:42,830  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:390 Y2:420
Tammy here has confessed.

1135
00:58:53,547 --> 00:58:56,243  X1:303 X2:417 Y1:390 Y2:420
I told you.

1136
00:58:56,316 --> 00:58:57,374  X1:303 X2:417 Y1:390 Y2:420
I told you.

1137
00:58:57,450 --> 00:58:59,577  X1:175 X2:543 Y1:390 Y2:420
You're gonna pay for my poster!

1138
00:58:59,653 --> 00:59:00,779  X1:245 X2:474 Y1:390 Y2:419
OK, easy, now, now,

Just run along.

1141
00:59:03,456 --> 00:59:04,923  X1:285 X2:437 Y1:390 Y2:414

on my clothes and my fiingers,

1144
00:59:10,764 --> 00:59:13,392  X1:228 X2:492 Y1:358 Y2:420

1148
00:59:21,107 --> 00:59:23,439  X1:229 X2:492 Y1:358 Y2:420

01:03:46,456 --> 01:03:48,321  X1:232 X2:488 Y1:390 Y2:414
and wilder and wilder.

1196
01:03:48,391 --> 01:03:50,120  X1:185 X2:534 Y1:358 Y2:420
Who knows what the hell else
you're doing out there

1197
01:03:50,193 --> 01:03:53,128  X1:177 X2:543 Y1:390 Y2:414
that we don't even know about.

1198
01:03:53,196 --> 01:03:55,357  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:390 Y2:420
Wejust had a long conversation

1199
01:03:55,431 --> 01:03:57,331  X1:237 X2:482 Y1:390 Y2:414
with Walt Hendricks.

1200
01:03:57,400 --> 01:04:00,392  X1:233 X2:487 Y1:358 Y2:414
Just got offthe phone
with him at his home.

1201
01:04:00,470 --> 01:04:02,665  X1:217 X2:501 Y1:358 Y2:420
You know he doesn't
wantyou back at Carver.

1202
01:04:02,739 --> 01:04:05,902  X1:241 X2:480 Y1:358 Y2:420
He's fed up with you.
Fed up,

1203
01:04:05,975 --> 01:04:06,907  X1:230 X2:489 Y1:390 Y2:414
and I don't blame him.

1204
01:04:06,976 --> 01:04:09,206  X1:290 X2:430 Y1:358 Y2:414
- Dick, Dick.
- What?

1205
01:04:09,279 --> 01:04:10,644  X1:214 X2:502 Y1:390 Y2:420
Tammy, your father and I

1206
01:04:10,713 --> 01:04:11,645  X1:255 X2:465 Y1:390 Y2:420
have been talking,

1207
01:04:11,714 --> 01:04:13,579  X1:245 X2:476 Y1:358 Y2:414
and we've come to
a decision that we--

1208
01:04:13,650 --> 01:04:15,982  X1:236 X2:484 Y1:358 Y2:413
You're going
to Immaculate Heart.

1209
01:04:16,052 --> 01:04:17,917  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:390 Y2:420
That's whereyou belong.

1210
01:04:17,987 --> 01:04:21,684  X1:201 X2:522 Y1:358 Y2:420
Maybe the nuns will be able
to straighten you out.

1211
01:04:21,758 --> 01:04:24,818  X1:241 X2:478 Y1:358 Y2:420
Is that funny?
You think it's funny?

1212
01:05:14,811 --> 01:05:16,278  X1:265 X2:454 Y1:390 Y2:420
(Baby Coughing)

1213
01:05:17,981 --> 01:05:20,882  X1:311 X2:408 Y1:390 Y2:420
(Cooing)

1214
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:33,094  X1:289 X2:431 Y1:390 Y2:420
(Soft Crying)

1215
01:05:55,952 --> 01:05:57,817  X1:338 X2:381 Y1:390 Y2:413
OK.

1216
01:06:48,771 --> 01:06:50,329  X1:228 X2:491 Y1:390 Y2:420
Tracy: Dear LordJesus,

1217
01:06:50,406 --> 01:06:53,102  X1:191 X2:530 Y1:358 Y2:420
I do not often speakwith You
and ask for things,

1218
01:06:53,176 --> 01:06:54,803  X1:205 X2:516 Y1:390 Y2:420
but now I really must insist

1219
01:06:54,877 --> 01:06:56,777  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:358 Y2:417
that You help me
win the election tomorrow,

1220
01:06:56,846 --> 01:06:59,280  X1:213 X2:506 Y1:358 Y2:417
because I deserve it
and Paul Metzler doesn't,

1221
01:06:59,349 --> 01:07:01,317  X1:257 X2:462 Y1:390 Y2:414
as You well know.

1222
01:07:01,384 --> 01:07:03,215  X1:227 X2:494 Y1:358 Y2:414
I realize that
it was Your divine hand

1223
01:07:03,286 --> 01:07:04,844  X1:169 X2:551 Y1:390 Y2:420
that disqualifiied Tammy Metzler,

1224
01:07:04,921 --> 01:07:07,822  X1:188 X2:532 Y1:358 Y2:420
and now I'm asking
that You go that one last mile

1225
01:07:07,890 --> 01:07:10,415  X1:215 X2:505 Y1:358 Y2:420
and make sure to put me
in offiice where I belong

1226
01:07:10,493 --> 01:07:12,427  X1:231 X2:490 Y1:358 Y2:414
so that I may carry out
Yourwill on Earth

1227
01:07:12,495 --> 01:07:15,589  X1:222 X2:498 Y1:390 Y2:414
as it is in heaven. Amen.

1228
01:07:15,665 --> 01:07:16,757  X1:252 X2:467 Y1:390 Y2:420
Tammy: Dear God,

1229
01:07:16,833 --> 01:07:18,323  X1:194 X2:526 Y1:390 Y2:417
I know I don't believe in You,

1230
01:07:18,401 --> 01:07:20,164  X1:225 X2:496 Y1:358 Y2:417
but since I'll be starting
Catholic school soon,

1231
01:07:20,236 --> 01:07:22,295  X1:257 X2:463 Y1:358 Y2:420
I thought I should
at least practice.

1232
01:07:22,372 --> 01:07:24,863  X1:214 X2:509 Y1:390 Y2:417
Let's see, what do I want?

1233
01:07:24,941 --> 01:07:27,375  X1:243 X2:479 Y1:358 Y2:414
I want Lisa to realize
what a bitch she is

1234
01:07:27,443 --> 01:07:29,240  X1:172 X2:550 Y1:390 Y2:420
and feel really bad and apologize

1235
01:07:29,312 --> 01:07:30,540  X1:243 X2:478 Y1:390 Y2:414
for how she hurt me

1236
01:07:30,613 --> 01:07:32,672  X1:239 X2:480 Y1:358 Y2:414
and know how much
I still love her.

1237
01:07:32,749 --> 01:07:35,274  X1:235 X2:485 Y1:358 Y2:414
In spite ofeverything,
I still want Paul

1238
01:07:35,351 --> 01:07:36,409  X1:185 X2:534 Y1:390 Y2:417
to win the election tomorrow,

1239
01:07:36,486 --> 01:07:39,922  X1:247 X2:474 Y1:358 Y2:417
not that cunt Tracy.
Oh, and I also want

1240
01:07:39,989 --> 01:07:41,980  X1:241 X2:479 Y1:358 Y2:420
a really expensive
pair ofleather pants,

1241
01:07:42,058 --> 01:07:43,525  X1:212 X2:509 Y1:390 Y2:420
and someday I want to be

1242
01:07:43,593 --> 01:07:47,723  X1:189 X2:529 Y1:358 Y2:420
really good friends
with Madonna. Love, Tammy.

1243
01:07:47,797 --> 01:07:49,424  X1:211 X2:511 Y1:390 Y2:417
Paul: Dear God, thankYou

1244
01:07:49,499 --> 01:07:50,727  X1:237 X2:482 Y1:390 Y2:420
for all Your blessings.

1245
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:52,290  X1:171 X2:547 Y1:390 Y2:420
You've given me so many things,

1246
01:07:52,368 --> 01:07:55,929  X1:212 X2:508 Y1:358 Y2:420
like good health,
nice parents, a nice truck,

1247
01:07:56,005 --> 01:07:57,939  X1:258 X2:461 Y1:358 Y2:420
and what I'm told
is a large penis,

1248
01:07:58,007 --> 01:07:59,702  X1:238 X2:482 Y1:390 Y2:420
and I'm very grateful.

1249
01:07:59,776 --> 01:08:01,903  X1:237 X2:485 Y1:358 Y2:420
But I sure am worried
about Tammy.

1250
01:08:01,978 --> 01:08:03,707  X1:257 X2:465 Y1:358 Y2:414
In my heart
I still can't believe

1251
01:08:03,780 --> 01:08:05,179  X1:207 X2:512 Y1:390 Y2:420
she tore down my posters,

1252
01:08:05,248 --> 01:08:08,149  X1:220 X2:500 Y1:358 Y2:420
but sometimes she does
get so weird and angry.

1253
01:08:08,217 --> 01:08:10,617  X1:246 X2:474 Y1:358 Y2:420
Please help her
be a happier person

1254
01:08:10,686 --> 01:08:12,381  X1:232 X2:488 Y1:358 Y2:414
because she's
so smart and sensitive

1255
01:08:12,455 --> 01:08:14,480  X1:227 X2:493 Y1:390 Y2:414
and I love her so much.

1256
01:08:14,557 --> 01:08:17,617  X1:191 X2:530 Y1:358 Y2:414
Also, I'm nervous
about the election tomorrow

1257
01:08:17,693 --> 01:08:19,752  X1:241 X2:479 Y1:358 Y2:417
and I guess
I want to win and all,

1258
01:08:19,829 --> 01:08:22,093  X1:261 X2:459 Y1:358 Y2:420
but I know that's
totally up to You.

1259
01:08:22,165 --> 01:08:24,065  X1:228 X2:490 Y1:358 Y2:420
You'll decide
who the best person is

1260
01:08:24,133 --> 01:08:27,364  X1:205 X2:514 Y1:358 Y2:420
and I'll accept it,
and forgive me for my sins,

1261
01:08:27,437 --> 01:08:30,929  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:390 Y2:420
whatever they may be. Amen.

1262
01:08:36,846 --> 01:08:39,178  X1:228 X2:492 Y1:358 Y2:420
Jim: Linda never
came home that night.

1263
01:08:39,248 --> 01:08:42,081  X1:266 X2:454 Y1:358 Y2:420
I know, because
I spent 1 0 hours

1264
01:08:42,151 --> 01:08:44,415  X1:205 X2:513 Y1:390 Y2:420
waiting outside her house.

1265
01:08:44,487 --> 01:08:47,422  X1:299 X2:421 Y1:390 Y2:420
(Groaning)

1266
01:08:59,335 --> 01:09:01,132  X1:309 X2:410 Y1:390 Y2:417
Oh, God.

1267
01:09:32,668 --> 01:09:34,158  X1:227 X2:491 Y1:390 Y2:420
Tracy: On election day,

1268
01:09:34,237 --> 01:09:36,000  X1:169 X2:552 Y1:390 Y2:420
my mom and I got up really early,

1269
01:09:36,072 --> 01:09:39,769  X1:206 X2:514 Y1:358 Y2:420
and togetherwe
customized 480 cupcakes.

1270
01:09:45,681 --> 01:09:47,581  X1:231 X2:488 Y1:390 Y2:420
Good morning, Mr. M.

1271
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:54,084  X1:244 X2:478 Y1:358 Y2:420
Looks likeyou could
use a cupcake.

1272
01:10:02,198 --> 01:10:03,859  X1:170 X2:553 Y1:390 Y2:420
Hey, what happened toyour eye?

1273
01:10:08,704 --> 01:10:10,137  X1:286 X2:433 Y1:390 Y2:419
Areyou OK?

1274
01:10:10,239 --> 01:10:11,228  X1:268 X2:452 Y1:390 Y2:417
'' Mr. McAllister,

1275
01:10:12,561 --> 01:10:14,791  X1:212 X2:511 Y1:358 Y2:420
Mr. McAllister, somebody
tore down my posters.

1276
01:10:14,863 --> 01:10:17,127  X1:227 X2:493 Y1:390 Y2:417
It's not fair, it's not fair.

1277
01:10:17,199 --> 01:10:20,168  X1:181 X2:539 Y1:358 Y2:414
Can I have an 'A'?
Can I have a recommendation?

1278
01:10:20,235 --> 01:10:22,362  X1:286 X2:434 Y1:390 Y2:416
Can I, can I?''

1279
01:10:22,437 --> 01:10:24,428  X1:297 X2:425 Y1:390 Y2:414
Fuck them.

1284
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:55,297  X1:216 X2:504 Y1:358 Y2:420
Why did you do that?
I trusted you completely.

1285
01:10:55,370 --> 01:10:57,361  X1:225 X2:493 Y1:358 Y2:420
And you ruined my life,

1286

You ruined Diane's life--
You ruined my life,

1288
01:11:02,911 --> 01:11:05,641  X1:216 X2:505 Y1:390 Y2:420
is that whatyou wanted?

1289
01:11:05,714 --> 01:11:09,912  X1:192 X2:528 Y1:358 Y2:419
I'm sorry--I'm sorry,
I'm just--I'm going nuts here,

1290
01:11:09,985 --> 01:11:13,284  X1:173 X2:546 Y1:390 Y2:420
and I really thinkwe should talk.

1291

01:11:44,119 --> 01:11:46,644  X1:231 X2:488 Y1:358 Y2:420
determined ineligible,
I repeat, ineligible

1302
01:11:46,721 --> 01:11:48,313  X1:245 X2:475 Y1:390 Y2:420
for S.G.A. president.

1303
01:11:48,390 --> 01:11:50,153  X1:242 X2:477 Y1:358 Y2:420
All other candidates
are eligible.

1304
01:11:50,225 --> 01:11:53,422  X1:238 X2:481 Y1:358 Y2:420
You may, uh,
vote for any ofthose,

1305
01:11:53,495 --> 01:11:55,588  X1:221 X2:500 Y1:390 Y2:420
but not Tammy Metzler.

1306
01:11:56,965 --> 01:11:58,990  X1:226 X2:493 Y1:358 Y2:417
Tracy: When the time
came to cast ourvotes,

1307
01:11:59,067 --> 01:12:01,365  X1:229 X2:490 Y1:358 Y2:420
I stood in line
just like everyone else.

1308
01:12:01,436 --> 01:12:02,368  X1:308 X2:413 Y1:390 Y2:419
Hi, Tracy.

1309
01:12:02,437 --> 01:12:04,302  X1:265 X2:453 Y1:390 Y2:420
Tracy Enid Flick.

1310
01:12:04,372 --> 01:12:05,396  X1:319 X2:402 Y1:390 Y2:414
I know.

1311
01:12:06,575 --> 01:12:08,372  X1:296 X2:423 Y1:390 Y2:420
Thankyou.

1312
01:12:19,754 --> 01:12:21,312  X1:293 X2:430 Y1:390 Y2:420
Ready, Phil?

1313
01:12:21,389 --> 01:12:22,651  X1:264 X2:457 Y1:390 Y2:420
Phil: Yeah, ready.

1314
01:12:30,732 --> 01:12:32,324  X1:286 X2:432 Y1:390 Y2:417
Thanks, Phil.

1315
01:12:36,438 --> 01:12:38,201  X1:275 X2:444 Y1:390 Y2:420
Oh, hey, Tracy.

1316
01:12:38,273 --> 01:12:39,501  X1:315 X2:407 Y1:390 Y2:417
Hi, Paul.

1317
01:12:39,574 --> 01:12:41,565  X1:255 X2:466 Y1:390 Y2:420
Isn't this exciting?

1318
01:12:41,643 --> 01:12:42,735  X1:300 X2:422 Y1:390 Y2:414
Mm-hmm.

1319
01:12:42,811 --> 01:12:45,302  X1:265 X2:453 Y1:390 Y2:420
Well, good luck.

1320
01:12:45,380 --> 01:12:47,848  X1:229 X2:490 Y1:390 Y2:417
Thanks, Paul. You, too.

1321
01:12:47,916 --> 01:12:50,316  X1:294 X2:425 Y1:390 Y2:417
Oh, thanks!

1322
01:12:56,358 --> 01:12:58,019  X1:258 X2:463 Y1:390 Y2:414
Paul: It's so weird.

1323
01:12:58,093 --> 01:13:00,493  X1:237 X2:486 Y1:358 Y2:414
Do people alwaysjust
vote for themselves?

1324
01:13:00,562 --> 01:13:03,588  X1:203 X2:519 Y1:358 Y2:420
'Cause looking at
my own name on the ballot

1325
01:13:03,665 --> 01:13:06,099  X1:248 X2:472 Y1:390 Y2:420
I just...I don't know,

1326
01:13:06,168 --> 01:13:09,365  X1:212 X2:510 Y1:358 Y2:420
I just felt like it's not right
to vote foryourself.

1327
01:13:24,486 --> 01:13:26,113  X1:283 X2:437 Y1:390 Y2:420
(Door Opens)

1328
01:13:27,622 --> 01:13:28,816  X1:299 X2:421 Y1:390 Y2:417
Ok, Mr. M.

1329
01:13:30,058 --> 01:13:33,084  X1:282 X2:437 Y1:390 Y2:420
All right. So...

1330
01:13:33,161 --> 01:13:34,594  X1:248 X2:472 Y1:390 Y2:420
let's start counting.

1331
01:13:34,663 --> 01:13:38,121  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:358 Y2:417
OK, well, as the election
committee chairman,

1332
01:13:38,200 --> 01:13:39,258  X1:240 X2:480 Y1:390 Y2:414
I'll do the fiirst count.

1333
01:13:39,334 --> 01:13:40,926  X1:239 X2:480 Y1:358 Y2:417
And then you can do
the second count,

1334
01:13:41,002 --> 01:13:42,469  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:358 Y2:420
you know, for
the 2 independent counts.

1335
01:13:42,537 --> 01:13:45,131  X1:229 X2:492 Y1:390 Y2:420
Fine. So doyour count.

1336
01:13:45,207 --> 01:13:47,607  X1:239 X2:481 Y1:358 Y2:420
Start with president,
and I'll be right back.

1337
01:13:47,676 --> 01:13:50,668  X1:168 X2:550 Y1:390 Y2:420
You have the key, Mr. McAllister.

1338
01:13:53,782 --> 01:13:56,216  X1:327 X2:394 Y1:390 Y2:420
Right.

1339
01:14:08,863 --> 01:14:11,491  X1:197 X2:523 Y1:390 Y2:420
Areyou OK, Mr. McAllister?

1340
01:14:11,566 --> 01:14:13,761  X1:158 X2:562 Y1:390 Y2:420
Yeah. What happened toyour eye?

1341
01:14:13,835 --> 01:14:16,531  X1:250 X2:470 Y1:358 Y2:420
I'm fiine!
It'sjust a bee sting.

1342
01:14:16,605 --> 01:14:19,005  X1:249 X2:470 Y1:358 Y2:420
A simple little
everyday bee sting.

1343
01:14:19,074 --> 01:14:22,043  X1:199 X2:521 Y1:358 Y2:420
Some people can get stung,
it's no big deal.

1344
01:14:22,110 --> 01:14:24,135  X1:275 X2:446 Y1:390 Y2:420
Me--I swell up.

1345
01:14:24,212 --> 01:14:26,806  X1:205 X2:515 Y1:358 Y2:420
There's not much time left
until eighth period.

1346
01:14:26,881 --> 01:14:29,441  X1:217 X2:502 Y1:358 Y2:420
I have other things
going on, too, you know.

1347
01:14:29,517 --> 01:14:33,681  X1:242 X2:477 Y1:390 Y2:414
Yeah. OK. We know.

1348
01:14:33,755 --> 01:14:35,882  X1:264 X2:456 Y1:358 Y2:420
All right.
I'll be right back.

1349
01:14:39,828 --> 01:14:41,989  X1:170 X2:551 Y1:358 Y2:420
Answering Machine:
Hi. You've reached the Novotnys.

1350
01:14:42,063 --> 01:14:43,860  X1:200 X2:517 Y1:358 Y2:420
We're not around, but we'll
call you back real soon.

1351
01:14:43,932 --> 01:14:45,092  X1:270 X2:452 Y1:390 Y2:420
Have a nice day.

1352
01:14:45,166 --> 01:14:46,463  X1:323 X2:396 Y1:390 Y2:420
(Beep)

1353
01:14:46,534 --> 01:14:48,126  X1:262 X2:459 Y1:390 Y2:420
Uh, it's me again.

1354
01:14:48,203 --> 01:14:51,434  X1:225 X2:494 Y1:358 Y2:420
I'm sorry for all
the messages, but, uh...

1355
01:14:51,506 --> 01:14:53,064  X1:243 X2:475 Y1:358 Y2:420
Linda, ifI could
just hearyourvoice.

1356
01:14:53,141 --> 01:14:55,109  X1:166 X2:555 Y1:390 Y2:420
Ifyou'd only acknowledge that I--

1357
01:14:55,176 --> 01:14:56,108  X1:241 X2:479 Y1:390 Y2:420
(Phone Is Picked Up)

1358
01:14:56,177 --> 01:14:57,109  X1:187 X2:536 Y1:390 Y2:420
Linda: What doyou want,Jim?

1359
01:14:57,178 --> 01:14:58,770  X1:284 X2:435 Y1:390 Y2:414
You're there.

1360
01:14:58,847 --> 01:15:02,180  X1:273 X2:445 Y1:390 Y2:417
Yeah, I'm here.

1361
01:15:02,250 --> 01:15:03,182  X1:266 X2:456 Y1:390 Y2:420
Linda, I loveyou.

1362
01:15:03,251 --> 01:15:04,218  X1:287 X2:433 Y1:390 Y2:420
(Linda Sighs)

1363
01:15:04,286 --> 01:15:07,016  X1:228 X2:491 Y1:358 Y2:414
Don't say that.
You know it's not true.

1364
01:15:07,088 --> 01:15:09,249  X1:232 X2:489 Y1:358 Y2:420
It's the only true thing
I know anymore.

1365
01:15:09,324 --> 01:15:12,350  X1:224 X2:498 Y1:358 Y2:414
We made a mistake.
Let's not make it worse.

1366
01:15:12,427 --> 01:15:15,089  X1:237 X2:481 Y1:358 Y2:414
A mistake?
That was no mistake!

1367
01:15:15,163 --> 01:15:17,893  X1:240 X2:478 Y1:358 Y2:420
I was lonely.
You took advantage.

1368
01:15:17,966 --> 01:15:22,335  X1:189 X2:533 Y1:390 Y2:420
Me?! I took advantage ofyou?

1369
01:15:22,404 --> 01:15:24,838  X1:175 X2:543 Y1:358 Y2:414
You hugged me! You kissed me!
You're the one who--

1370
01:15:24,906 --> 01:15:27,431  X1:261 X2:459 Y1:390 Y2:420
(Linda Hangs Up)

1371
01:15:32,347 --> 01:15:34,008  X1:216 X2:506 Y1:390 Y2:420
Hey, Mr. M, big day, huh?

1372
01:15:34,082 --> 01:15:35,947  X1:277 X2:445 Y1:390 Y2:417
Not now, Paul.

1373
01:15:41,122 --> 01:15:42,054  X1:244 X2:476 Y1:390 Y2:420
What haveyou got?

1374
01:15:42,123 --> 01:15:44,614  X1:185 X2:533 Y1:390 Y2:420
Well, I'm not supposed to tell.

1375
01:15:44,693 --> 01:15:46,627  X1:188 X2:533 Y1:390 Y2:420
Not until you've counted, too.

1376
01:15:46,695 --> 01:15:47,719  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:390 Y2:420
We're each supposed to make

1377
01:15:47,796 --> 01:15:48,888  X1:228 X2:491 Y1:390 Y2:420
an independent count.

1378
01:15:48,963 --> 01:15:50,362  X1:234 X2:486 Y1:390 Y2:420
You're kidding, right?

1379
01:15:50,432 --> 01:15:52,127  X1:238 X2:481 Y1:358 Y2:417
Well, I thought
those were the rules,

1380
01:15:52,200 --> 01:15:53,132  X1:275 X2:446 Y1:390 Y2:414
Mr. McAllister.

1381
01:15:53,201 --> 01:15:55,101  X1:255 X2:465 Y1:358 Y2:420
Ifthey've changed
in anyway, I can--

1382
01:15:55,170 --> 01:15:56,899  X1:221 X2:501 Y1:358 Y2:420
Larry, we're not electing
the fucking pope here.

1383
01:15:56,971 --> 01:15:58,734  X1:234 X2:484 Y1:390 Y2:420
Just tell me who won.

1384
01:16:04,412 --> 01:16:05,879  X1:234 X2:487 Y1:390 Y2:420
It's a squeaker, Mr. M.

1385
01:16:05,947 --> 01:16:08,916  X1:226 X2:495 Y1:390 Y2:420
I've got Tracy by a vote.

1386
01:16:08,983 --> 01:16:10,416  X1:280 X2:438 Y1:390 Y2:419
Just one vote.

1387
01:16:18,493 --> 01:16:19,960  X1:321 X2:402 Y1:390 Y2:413
Mr. M?

1388
01:16:22,330 --> 01:16:23,354  X1:308 X2:410 Y1:390 Y2:420
All right.

1389
01:16:25,266 --> 01:16:26,198  X1:338 X2:381 Y1:390 Y2:413
OK.

1390
01:16:26,267 --> 01:16:30,931  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:390 Y2:420
Well, guess I better do my count.

1391
01:17:27,571 --> 01:17:29,505  X1:336 X2:383 Y1:390 Y2:419
Yay!

1392
01:17:29,573 --> 01:17:32,041  X1:336 X2:383 Y1:390 Y2:419
Yay!

1393
01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:38,341  X1:336 X2:383 Y1:390 Y2:419
Yay!

1394
01:17:41,752 --> 01:17:44,687  X1:196 X2:525 Y1:358 Y2:420
Jim: I was at the end of
my count when it happened.

1395
01:17:44,755 --> 01:17:48,691  X1:202 X2:518 Y1:358 Y2:420
I'd come up with exactly
the same numbers as Larry:

1396
01:17:48,759 --> 01:17:51,489  X1:291 X2:429 Y1:390 Y2:413
256 to 257.

1397
01:17:51,562 --> 01:17:54,326  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:358 Y2:420
Tracy had won the election
by a single vote.

1398
01:17:55,833 --> 01:17:57,630  X1:322 X2:398 Y1:390 Y2:420
(Sighs)

1399
01:17:57,701 --> 01:18:00,693  X1:219 X2:503 Y1:358 Y2:420
I was about to announce
my tallywhen...

1400
01:18:08,112 --> 01:18:11,741  X1:196 X2:524 Y1:358 Y2:414
the sight ofTracy
at that moment affected me

1401
01:18:11,815 --> 01:18:13,715  X1:201 X2:520 Y1:390 Y2:420
in a way I can't fully explain.

1402
01:18:13,784 --> 01:18:16,981  X1:168 X2:553 Y1:390 Y2:420
Part ofit was that she was spying.

1403
01:18:17,054 --> 01:18:20,182  X1:210 X2:511 Y1:390 Y2:420
But mostly it was her face.

1404
01:18:23,427 --> 01:18:27,193  X1:224 X2:496 Y1:358 Y2:414
Who knew how high
she would climb in life?

1405
01:18:27,264 --> 01:18:30,665  X1:182 X2:541 Y1:358 Y2:414
How many people would suffer
because ofher?

1406
01:18:30,734 --> 01:18:32,964  X1:257 X2:464 Y1:390 Y2:420
I had to stop her...

1407
01:18:33,037 --> 01:18:35,232  X1:333 X2:388 Y1:396 Y2:414
now.

1408
01:18:56,327 --> 01:19:00,423  X1:309 X2:410 Y1:390 Y2:420
(Coughs)

1409
01:19:06,737 --> 01:19:08,136  X1:326 X2:396 Y1:390 Y2:419
Larry?

1410
01:19:08,205 --> 01:19:10,264  X1:324 X2:395 Y1:390 Y2:414
Yeah?

1411
01:19:10,341 --> 01:19:12,673  X1:208 X2:512 Y1:390 Y2:420
I thinkwe have a problem.

1412
01:19:12,743 --> 01:19:16,110  X1:249 X2:471 Y1:390 Y2:417
253, 254, and 255.

1413
01:19:16,180 --> 01:19:17,738  X1:181 X2:537 Y1:390 Y2:420
Yep, I get the same as you,Jim.

1414
01:19:17,815 --> 01:19:19,680  X1:249 X2:470 Y1:358 Y2:420
Looks like Paul's
our next president.

1415
01:19:19,750 --> 01:19:21,308  X1:280 X2:442 Y1:390 Y2:419
Larry: No way!

1416
01:19:21,385 --> 01:19:22,784  X1:214 X2:506 Y1:390 Y2:414
I-I-It doesn't make sense.

1417
01:19:22,853 --> 01:19:25,344  X1:222 X2:500 Y1:358 Y2:420
Well, sorry, Larry,
but my fiigures work out

1418
01:19:25,422 --> 01:19:26,946  X1:250 X2:470 Y1:358 Y2:414
exactly the same
as Mr. McAllister's.

1419
01:19:27,024 --> 01:19:31,518  X1:233 X2:488 Y1:358 Y2:420
I get, uh, 256 for Paul,
255 forTracy.

1420
01:19:31,595 --> 01:19:34,758  X1:204 X2:516 Y1:390 Y2:420
And 290 disregards, right?

1421
01:19:34,832 --> 01:19:35,856  X1:289 X2:432 Y1:390 Y2:420
Ifyou say so.

1422
01:19:35,933 --> 01:19:37,867  X1:247 X2:475 Y1:358 Y2:420
MostlyTammy fans,
ifyou can believe it.

1423
01:19:37,935 --> 01:19:39,368  X1:229 X2:490 Y1:390 Y2:420
See? It doesn't add up.

1424
01:19:39,436 --> 01:19:42,837  X1:221 X2:498 Y1:358 Y2:420
There were 801 ballots,
but 803 people voted.

1425
01:19:42,906 --> 01:19:44,100  X1:251 X2:470 Y1:358 Y2:420
Well, there must
be 2 votes missing.

1426
01:19:44,174 --> 01:19:45,368  X1:250 X2:470 Y1:390 Y2:420
Check the register.

1427
01:19:45,442 --> 01:19:47,535  X1:200 X2:521 Y1:358 Y2:420
He's right. 2 people must
have pocketed their ballots.

1428
01:19:47,611 --> 01:19:49,203  X1:239 X2:482 Y1:390 Y2:420
Usually there's more.

1429
01:19:49,279 --> 01:19:53,079  X1:241 X2:479 Y1:358 Y2:414
But theywere there.
I counted 803 votes.

1430
01:19:53,150 --> 01:19:55,516  X1:229 X2:492 Y1:358 Y2:420
It happens, Larry.
People make mistakes.

1431
01:19:55,586 --> 01:19:57,178  X1:223 X2:497 Y1:390 Y2:414
I didn't make a mistake.

1432
01:19:57,254 --> 01:19:59,484  X1:243 X2:480 Y1:358 Y2:420
Everyvote was there
when you sat down.

1433
01:19:59,556 --> 01:20:02,218  X1:222 X2:499 Y1:358 Y2:420
Easy, Falch. I don't
like whereyou're going.

1434
01:20:02,292 --> 01:20:03,623  X1:222 X2:499 Y1:390 Y2:420
I'm sorry, Dr. Hendricks,

1435
01:20:03,694 --> 01:20:05,821  X1:250 X2:469 Y1:358 Y2:414
but everyvote
was accounted for.

1436
01:20:05,896 --> 01:20:07,363  X1:242 X2:480 Y1:390 Y2:420
Falch, that's enough.

1437
01:20:07,431 --> 01:20:09,695  X1:290 X2:431 Y1:390 Y2:420
End ofstory.

1438
01:20:09,767 --> 01:20:11,359  X1:255 X2:464 Y1:390 Y2:420
(Trumpet Fanfare)

1439
01:20:30,688 --> 01:20:31,916  X1:331 X2:392 Y1:390 Y2:414
Paul?

1440
01:20:31,989 --> 01:20:35,117  X1:191 X2:529 Y1:358 Y2:420
I just want to letyou know
that no matterwhat happens

1441
01:20:35,192 --> 01:20:36,181  X1:226 X2:493 Y1:390 Y2:417
and how this turns out,

1442
01:20:36,260 --> 01:20:38,455  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:390 Y2:420
you've run a really great campaign.

1443
01:20:38,529 --> 01:20:40,053  X1:298 X2:422 Y1:390 Y2:414
Good luck.

1444
01:20:40,130 --> 01:20:42,792  X1:246 X2:472 Y1:358 Y2:417
Well, thanks, Tracy.
You, too.

1445
01:20:42,866 --> 01:20:45,027  X1:239 X2:482 Y1:390 Y2:420
I'm just glad it's over.

1446
01:20:46,904 --> 01:20:48,394  X1:215 X2:505 Y1:358 Y2:419
Jim:
Ifwe canjust get started.

1447
01:20:48,472 --> 01:20:51,100  X1:273 X2:449 Y1:390 Y2:420
People. People.

1448
01:20:51,175 --> 01:20:52,767  X1:227 X2:492 Y1:358 Y2:417
As soon as the winners
are announced,

1449
01:20:52,843 --> 01:20:54,572  X1:217 X2:503 Y1:390 Y2:420
we can all go home, OK?

1450
01:20:54,645 --> 01:20:57,705  X1:244 X2:476 Y1:390 Y2:413
Some contests are...

1451
01:20:57,781 --> 01:21:01,012  X1:248 X2:474 Y1:358 Y2:414
are so well-fought
that it seems unfair

1452
01:21:01,085 --> 01:21:02,211  X1:238 X2:481 Y1:390 Y2:414
for someone to win...

1453
01:21:02,286 --> 01:21:05,744  X1:201 X2:518 Y1:358 Y2:420
(Thinks) Act surprised.
Walk slowly to the podium.

1454
01:21:05,823 --> 01:21:09,315  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:358 Y2:414
Be modest. Thank them
for this incredible honor.

1455
01:21:09,393 --> 01:21:11,657  X1:207 X2:511 Y1:390 Y2:420
They're all highly qualifiied

1456
01:21:11,729 --> 01:21:16,359  X1:221 X2:500 Y1:358 Y2:420
and embody the, uh,
integrity that we expect

1457
01:21:16,433 --> 01:21:18,731  X1:202 X2:518 Y1:390 Y2:420
from the school leadership.

1458
01:21:18,802 --> 01:21:20,633  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:358 Y2:414
That said, the whole point
ofan election

1459
01:21:20,704 --> 01:21:23,264  X1:222 X2:498 Y1:358 Y2:420
is to chose a winner,
and thatyou have done.

1460
01:21:23,340 --> 01:21:25,774  X1:202 X2:516 Y1:390 Y2:420
We'll begin with president.

1461
01:21:25,843 --> 01:21:27,902  X1:258 X2:462 Y1:390 Y2:420
I'djust like to add

1462
01:21:27,978 --> 01:21:30,139  X1:193 X2:526 Y1:358 Y2:420
that this was
an extraordinarily close race.

1463
01:21:32,149 --> 01:21:34,777  X1:177 X2:544 Y1:358 Y2:420
It is my pleasure
to announce the next president

1467
01:21:53,036 --> 01:21:54,936  X1:231 X2:488 Y1:390 Y2:420
Jeez, you guys, thanks.

1468
01:21:56,740 --> 01:21:59,140  X1:278 X2:441 Y1:390 Y2:414
Wow! Thanks.

1469
01:21:59,209 --> 01:22:00,938  X1:224 X2:497 Y1:390 Y2:420
I promise to do my best

1470
01:22:01,011 --> 01:22:05,277  X1:217 X2:503 Y1:358 Y2:420
and do a really goodjob
and be a good president.

1471
01:22:05,349 --> 01:22:07,613  X1:246 X2:475 Y1:358 Y2:420
I just want to thank,

for being a super campaign manager.

1473
01:22:09,086 --> 01:22:12,146  X1:251 X2:470 Y1:390 Y2:420
I'd also like to say...

1474
01:22:12,222 --> 01:22:14,520  X1:298 X2:421 Y1:390 Y2:418
(Inaudible)

1475
01:22:51,895 --> 01:22:53,692  X1:302 X2:418 Y1:390 Y2:413
It's Mr. M.

1476
01:22:53,764 --> 01:22:56,824  X1:179 X2:540 Y1:390 Y2:417
Yes, over there. Yeah, come on.

1477
01:23:00,370 --> 01:23:02,736  X1:256 X2:465 Y1:358 Y2:414
Paul: Wow, Mr. M.
This is so wild.

1478
01:23:02,806 --> 01:23:04,433  X1:167 X2:551 Y1:390 Y2:420

1480

This is incredible.
This is great.

1481
01:23:07,511 --> 01:23:08,910  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:390 Y2:420
Well, these are my parents.

1482
01:23:08,979 --> 01:23:10,173  X1:265 X2:456 Y1:390 Y2:417
Hi, Dick Metzler.

1483
01:23:10,247 --> 01:23:11,179  X1:273 X2:445 Y1:390 Y2:420

1485
01:23:12,683 --> 01:23:14,207  X1:262 X2:457 Y1:358 Y2:420
Paul just thinks
the world ofyou.

1486
01:23:14,284 --> 01:23:15,251  X1:195 X2:526 Y1:390 Y2:420
I mean, you should hear him.

1487
01:23:15,319 --> 01:23:16,581  X1:209 X2:513 Y1:390 Y2:420
He goes on and on and on.

1488
01:23:16,653 --> 01:23:17,620  X1:262 X2:458 Y1:358 Y2:420
Yeah, apparently
you've really

1489
01:23:17,688 --> 01:23:18,950  X1:238 X2:484 Y1:358 Y2:420

1490
01:23:19,022 --> 01:23:20,182  X1:239 X2:480 Y1:358 Y2:420
with that student
council thing and all.

1491
01:23:20,257 --> 01:23:22,817  X1:178 X2:542 Y1:358 Y2:420
Oh, well--well, Paul
doesn't need any help from me.

1492
01:23:22,893 --> 01:23:25,123  X1:209 X2:510 Y1:358 Y2:420
He's--He's going places.
You should be very proud.

1493
01:23:25,195 --> 01:23:26,127  X1:276 X2:442 Y1:390 Y2:420

Hey, look, you're all alone.

1495

Oh, I'm just fiinishing up here.

1498
01:23:32,236 --> 01:23:33,634  X1:244 X2:476 Y1:390 Y2:420
I've gotta get home.

1499
01:23:33,768 --> 01:23:35,030  X1:288 X2:431 Y1:390 Y2:417
Oh, well, uh,

1500

why don'tyou guys
go sit down, and, uh...

1501
01:23:38,406 --> 01:23:40,237  X1:230 X2:490 Y1:358 Y2:420
you know, I'll catch up
with you in a minute.

1502
01:23:40,308 --> 01:23:42,242  X1:197 X2:522 Y1:358 Y2:420
I'm going to talk to Mr. M
about some important stuff,

1503
01:23:42,310 --> 01:23:43,242  X1:309 X2:412 Y1:390 Y2:420
all right?

1504
01:23:43,311 --> 01:23:44,608  X1:251 X2:467 Y1:358 Y2:420
Dick: All right.
That sounds great.

1505
01:23:44,679 --> 01:23:46,613  X1:195 X2:525 Y1:358 Y2:419
- Hey, sure nice to meetyou.
- Great to meetyou.

1506
01:23:46,681 --> 01:23:48,273  X1:219 X2:501 Y1:358 Y2:420
- Pleasure.
- So nice, and thankyou.

1507
01:23:48,349 --> 01:23:49,714  X1:286 X2:433 Y1:390 Y2:420
Jim: You bet.

1508
01:23:53,754 --> 01:23:55,449  X1:221 X2:499 Y1:358 Y2:416
So, Mr. M, I was starting
to think about,

1509
01:23:55,523 --> 01:23:57,650  X1:232 X2:486 Y1:358 Y2:414
you know, some ideas
forwhat we could do.

1510
01:23:57,725 --> 01:23:59,454  X1:268 X2:452 Y1:358 Y2:414
I was thinking
it would be cool

1511
01:23:59,527 --> 01:24:00,459  X1:257 X2:463 Y1:390 Y2:414
to have a carnival.

1512
01:24:00,528 --> 01:24:02,155  X1:181 X2:537 Y1:390 Y2:417
You know, with rides and stuff.

1513
01:24:02,230 --> 01:24:04,391  X1:217 X2:504 Y1:358 Y2:420
And it could be for,
like, muscular dystrophy.

1514
01:24:04,465 --> 01:24:07,696  X1:219 X2:500 Y1:358 Y2:414
And then on Halloween,
a haunted house.

1515
01:24:07,768 --> 01:24:09,531  X1:237 X2:482 Y1:358 Y2:420
You know, a really
good haunted house,

1516
01:24:09,604 --> 01:24:10,901  X1:205 X2:516 Y1:390 Y2:420
not those cheesy bad ones.

1517
01:24:10,972 --> 01:24:12,064  X1:253 X2:466 Y1:390 Y2:417
You know, I mean,

1518
01:24:12,139 --> 01:24:14,039  X1:184 X2:536 Y1:390 Y2:420
this one would be super-scary.

1519
01:24:14,108 --> 01:24:15,905  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:390 Y2:420
And then for homecoming,

1520
01:24:15,977 --> 01:24:17,604  X1:235 X2:486 Y1:358 Y2:420
well, you know
how lastyear's theme

1521
01:24:17,678 --> 01:24:20,169  X1:218 X2:502 Y1:358 Y2:420
was '' Heaven On Earth''?
Well, this year--

1522
01:24:20,248 --> 01:24:23,979  X1:198 X2:522 Y1:358 Y2:414
Paul, we'll have plenty of
time to talk about this later.

1523
01:24:24,051 --> 01:24:26,713  X1:239 X2:480 Y1:390 Y2:420
A wholeyear, in fact.

1524
01:24:26,787 --> 01:24:29,255  X1:228 X2:493 Y1:390 Y2:420
But right now, I'djust...

1525
01:24:29,323 --> 01:24:31,553  X1:230 X2:490 Y1:390 Y2:420
I need to fiinish my pie,

1526
01:24:31,626 --> 01:24:33,594  X1:287 X2:432 Y1:390 Y2:420
go on home.

1527
01:24:33,661 --> 01:24:36,960  X1:266 X2:452 Y1:390 Y2:420
Yeah, OK. Sorry.

1528
01:24:37,031 --> 01:24:40,023  X1:242 X2:477 Y1:358 Y2:420
Uh, Mr. M,
just one more thing.

1529
01:24:40,101 --> 01:24:43,730  X1:234 X2:485 Y1:358 Y2:420
So, uh, doyou think
Tracy's gonna be OK?

1530
01:24:43,804 --> 01:24:46,238  X1:237 X2:485 Y1:358 Y2:420
I mean, I saw her face
after the assembly.

1531
01:24:46,307 --> 01:24:48,605  X1:237 X2:484 Y1:358 Y2:420
It looked like she was
taking it pretty hard.

1532
01:24:48,676 --> 01:24:51,167  X1:218 X2:503 Y1:390 Y2:420
Don't worry about Tracy.

1533
01:24:51,245 --> 01:24:54,078  X1:283 X2:437 Y1:390 Y2:414
She'll be fiine.

1534
01:25:07,561 --> 01:25:09,392  X1:268 X2:452 Y1:390 Y2:417
Oh, sweetheart.

1535
01:25:12,233 --> 01:25:15,259  X1:272 X2:448 Y1:390 Y2:420
Oh, baby. Baby.

1536
01:25:15,336 --> 01:25:17,133  X1:306 X2:414 Y1:390 Y2:420
Oh, baby.

1537
01:25:17,204 --> 01:25:19,434  X1:241 X2:477 Y1:390 Y2:420
Take one ofmy pills.

1538
01:25:19,507 --> 01:25:22,442  X1:259 X2:459 Y1:390 Y2:414
You'll feel better.

1539
01:25:22,510 --> 01:25:24,569  X1:330 X2:391 Y1:390 Y2:413
Here.

1540
01:25:27,815 --> 01:25:31,546  X1:213 X2:506 Y1:390 Y2:420
Come on, baby. Come on.

1541
01:25:31,619 --> 01:25:35,385  X1:247 X2:475 Y1:390 Y2:414
Lie down. Lie down.

1542
01:25:35,456 --> 01:25:38,755  X1:256 X2:463 Y1:358 Y2:414
That's a good girl.
Lie down.

1543
01:25:38,826 --> 01:25:41,556  X1:303 X2:417 Y1:390 Y2:420
Good girl.

1544
01:25:41,629 --> 01:25:43,563  X1:264 X2:454 Y1:390 Y2:414
That's--That's it.

1545
01:25:43,631 --> 01:25:45,360  X1:276 X2:443 Y1:390 Y2:420
That's it, baby.

1546
01:25:45,433 --> 01:25:47,765  X1:268 X2:451 Y1:390 Y2:420
That's it, honey.

1547
01:25:52,306 --> 01:25:55,503  X1:239 X2:481 Y1:358 Y2:420
Maybeyou needed
more posters, honey.

1548
01:25:55,576 --> 01:25:58,841  X1:234 X2:486 Y1:358 Y2:420
Or ifyou'djust
taken my suggestions

1549
01:25:58,913 --> 01:26:00,710  X1:250 X2:470 Y1:390 Y2:420
aboutyour speech.

1550
01:26:00,781 --> 01:26:03,181  X1:285 X2:435 Y1:390 Y2:414
I don't know.

1551
01:26:03,250 --> 01:26:05,184  X1:254 X2:465 Y1:390 Y2:420
We'll fiigure it out.

1552
01:26:16,897 --> 01:26:18,831  X1:325 X2:397 Y1:390 Y2:413
Diane.

1553
01:26:18,899 --> 01:26:22,266  X1:208 X2:512 Y1:390 Y2:414
I--I made a mistake and I...

1554
01:26:30,144 --> 01:26:32,339  X1:189 X2:534 Y1:390 Y2:420
Did you want the same room?

1555
01:26:34,248 --> 01:26:35,977  X1:303 X2:416 Y1:390 Y2:417
Yeah, OK.

1556
01:26:37,351 --> 01:26:40,411  X1:288 X2:431 Y1:390 Y2:420
(Coins Drop)

1557
01:27:03,644 --> 01:27:05,635  X1:231 X2:490 Y1:390 Y2:420
[ding] It's a beautiful day[ding]

1558
01:27:05,713 --> 01:27:07,647  X1:222 X2:497 Y1:358 Y2:419
Jim:
The next day, I woke up

1559
01:27:07,715 --> 01:27:09,876  X1:238 X2:483 Y1:358 Y2:420
resolved to get
my life back on track.

1560
01:27:09,950 --> 01:27:12,976  X1:199 X2:523 Y1:358 Y2:420
The way I saw it, Diane's
kicking me out ofthe house

1561
01:27:13,053 --> 01:27:14,179  X1:228 X2:493 Y1:390 Y2:420
had been a good thing,

1562
01:27:14,255 --> 01:27:15,586  X1:274 X2:446 Y1:390 Y2:420
a wake-up call.

1563
01:27:15,656 --> 01:27:18,784  X1:234 X2:486 Y1:358 Y2:420
It wasn't a setback.
It was an opportunity.

1564
01:27:18,859 --> 01:27:20,884  X1:247 X2:474 Y1:358 Y2:414
I fiigured wejust
needed a little time

1565
01:27:20,961 --> 01:27:22,724  X1:249 X2:470 Y1:390 Y2:420
to work things out.

1566
01:27:22,797 --> 01:27:25,061  X1:193 X2:525 Y1:390 Y2:417
The election was behind me,

1567
01:27:25,132 --> 01:27:27,396  X1:223 X2:496 Y1:390 Y2:414
and the worst was over.

1568
01:27:27,468 --> 01:27:29,629  X1:234 X2:487 Y1:358 Y2:420
After all, what harm
had really been done?

1569
01:27:29,703 --> 01:27:31,568  X1:256 X2:466 Y1:390 Y2:420
Nobodywas dead.

1570
01:27:37,044 --> 01:27:37,976  X1:271 X2:449 Y1:358 Y2:419
Jim?
(Whistles)Jim?!

1571
01:27:38,045 --> 01:27:38,977  X1:327 X2:391 Y1:390 Y2:414
Yeah.

1572
01:27:39,046 --> 01:27:40,570  X1:228 X2:490 Y1:390 Y2:420
Walt wants to seeyou.

1573
01:27:40,648 --> 01:27:42,775  X1:293 X2:426 Y1:390 Y2:417
OK, thanks.

1574
01:27:54,228 --> 01:27:56,128  X1:283 X2:437 Y1:390 Y2:419

1575
01:27:59,366 --> 01:28:00,799  X1:275 X2:446 Y1:390 Y2:417
Mr. McAllister,

1576
01:28:00,868 --> 01:28:03,462  X1:232 X2:488 Y1:358 Y2:420
I hopeyou can help us
clear something up.

1577

1580
01:28:47,581 --> 01:28:48,513  X1:324 X2:404 Y1:390 Y2:414
Pierde.

1581
01:28:48,582 --> 01:28:49,810  X1:297 X2:435 Y1:390 Y2:419
.Nosotros?

1582
01:28:49,884 --> 01:28:51,476  X1:300 X2:429 Y1:390 Y2:414
Pierdemos.

1583
01:28:51,552 --> 01:28:52,917  X1:320 X2:409 Y1:390 Y2:413
Gracias.

1584
01:28:55,589 --> 01:28:57,557  X1:203 X2:516 Y1:390 Y2:414
Teacher: Se[n~]orPresidente.

1585
01:28:57,625 --> 01:29:01,356  X1:210 X2:520 Y1:390 Y2:420
Quieren verte enla ofiicina.

1586
01:29:01,428 --> 01:29:03,453  X1:331 X2:391 Y1:390 Y2:414
Huh?

1587
01:29:03,531 --> 01:29:04,463  X1:263 X2:457 Y1:390 Y2:418
(Knock On Door)

1588
01:29:04,532 --> 01:29:05,931  X1:276 X2:446 Y1:390 Y2:414
Dr. Hendricks?

1589
01:29:09,503 --> 01:29:11,437  X1:234 X2:484 Y1:358 Y2:420
Uh, come on in, son.
We have something...

1590
01:29:11,505 --> 01:29:14,736  X1:220 X2:501 Y1:390 Y2:420
hard we have to tell you.

1591
01:29:14,808 --> 01:29:15,740  X1:251 X2:471 Y1:390 Y2:420
Is it about Tammy?

1592
01:29:15,809 --> 01:29:17,208  X1:230 X2:490 Y1:390 Y2:414
It's about the election.

1593
01:29:20,848 --> 01:29:23,783  X1:257 X2:463 Y1:358 Y2:420
Jim: After Paul
got the bad news,

1594
01:29:23,851 --> 01:29:25,910  X1:191 X2:528 Y1:358 Y2:414
Walt asked for a few minutes
alone with me.

1595
01:29:25,986 --> 01:29:28,580  X1:218 X2:503 Y1:390 Y2:420
It was very simple, really.

1596
01:29:28,656 --> 01:29:30,624  X1:219 X2:501 Y1:390 Y2:420
I offered my resignation,

1597
01:29:30,691 --> 01:29:33,285  X1:261 X2:458 Y1:390 Y2:420
and he accepted.

1598
01:29:33,360 --> 01:29:36,921  X1:213 X2:509 Y1:358 Y2:420
Very quietly, it was
all over forJim McAllister

1599
01:29:36,997 --> 01:29:38,464  X1:274 X2:446 Y1:390 Y2:420
at Carver High.

1600
01:29:42,336 --> 01:29:44,861  X1:146 X2:575 Y1:390 Y2:420
Suddenly everyone knew who I was--

1601
01:29:44,939 --> 01:29:46,406  X1:241 X2:480 Y1:390 Y2:420
that corrupt teacher

1602
01:29:46,473 --> 01:29:49,203  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:358 Y2:420
who had tried to crush
the dreams ofan innocent girl.

1603
01:29:49,276 --> 01:29:52,302  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:358 Y2:420
Overnight, all the good things
I had ever done in my life

1604
01:29:52,379 --> 01:29:54,745  X1:291 X2:428 Y1:390 Y2:420
evaporated.

1605
01:29:54,815 --> 01:29:57,443  X1:228 X2:492 Y1:358 Y2:420
Soon the wire services
picked up on the story.

1606
01:29:57,518 --> 01:30:00,976  X1:156 X2:564 Y1:358 Y2:420
It was the kind ofabsurd news item
people E-mail each other

1607
01:30:01,055 --> 01:30:04,149  X1:230 X2:489 Y1:358 Y2:414
or post on the bulletin
board at work.

1608
01:30:04,224 --> 01:30:08,251  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:358 Y2:420
To top it all off, Diane had
started divorce proceedings.

1609
01:30:08,329 --> 01:30:11,423  X1:175 X2:544 Y1:358 Y2:420
She was completely unforgiving
about the thing with Linda.

1610
01:30:11,498 --> 01:30:14,194  X1:246 X2:477 Y1:358 Y2:420
In the end, she took
almost everything,

1611
01:30:14,268 --> 01:30:16,065  X1:243 X2:478 Y1:390 Y2:420
including the house.

1612
01:30:16,136 --> 01:30:18,229  X1:287 X2:433 Y1:390 Y2:420
I got the car.

1613
01:30:34,421 --> 01:30:36,321  X1:278 X2:440 Y1:390 Y2:420
Then one day,

1614
01:30:36,390 --> 01:30:38,483  X1:242 X2:480 Y1:358 Y2:420
I realized it was time
to get out ofOmaha

1615
01:30:38,559 --> 01:30:40,254  X1:282 X2:437 Y1:390 Y2:414
and move on.

1616
01:30:46,500 --> 01:30:47,933  X1:233 X2:487 Y1:358 Y2:420
Paul:
Senioryearwas great.

1617
01:30:48,002 --> 01:30:51,995  X1:219 X2:502 Y1:054 Y2:116
Sure, I didn't get to
play ball or be president,

1618
01:30:52,072 --> 01:30:55,371  X1:164 X2:556 Y1:358 Y2:420
but I got elected
homecoming king and prom king.

1619
01:30:55,442 --> 01:30:57,910  X1:246 X2:475 Y1:358 Y2:417
I got into Nebraska,
like I wanted,

1620
01:30:57,978 --> 01:30:59,343  X1:206 X2:514 Y1:390 Y2:420
and early rushed PhiDelts.

1621
01:30:59,413 --> 01:31:01,278  X1:205 X2:513 Y1:358 Y2:420
And at the end oftheyear,
me and my buddies

1622
01:31:01,348 --> 01:31:04,647  X1:183 X2:538 Y1:358 Y2:420
threw a bitchin' Mexican party
down at the cement plant.

1623
01:31:04,718 --> 01:31:07,035  X1:203 X2:516 Y1:390 Y2:420
Shit, that was a good party.

1624
01:31:07,169 --> 01:31:10,730  X1:206 X2:514 Y1:358 Y2:420
The only really bad thing
about senioryearwas Lisa.

1625
01:31:10,806 --> 01:31:12,467  X1:225 X2:496 Y1:358 Y2:420
Right before Christmas,
she dumped me.

1626
01:31:12,541 --> 01:31:14,839  X1:228 X2:491 Y1:358 Y2:420
One minute, she's
totally in love with me,

1627
01:31:14,910 --> 01:31:18,846  X1:184 X2:537 Y1:358 Y2:420
and then boom, she goes after
my football buddy Randy.

1628
01:31:18,914 --> 01:31:21,314  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:358 Y2:420
Sometimes I wonder
what would have happened

1629
01:31:21,383 --> 01:31:23,248  X1:246 X2:475 Y1:358 Y2:414
ifI had actuallywon
the election.

1630
01:31:23,318 --> 01:31:24,979  X1:243 X2:480 Y1:358 Y2:414
Maybe mywhole life
would be different.

1631
01:31:25,053 --> 01:31:27,988  X1:228 X2:493 Y1:358 Y2:420
Like I might never
have gone to Yosemite

1632
01:31:28,056 --> 01:31:29,785  X1:237 X2:482 Y1:390 Y2:420
with Greg and Travis.

1633
01:31:29,858 --> 01:31:31,883  X1:234 X2:486 Y1:390 Y2:420
Or maybe I'd be dead.

1634
01:31:31,960 --> 01:31:34,952  X1:292 X2:429 Y1:390 Y2:419
[ding]Alleluia [ding]

1635
01:31:35,030 --> 01:31:37,021  X1:221 X2:497 Y1:358 Y2:420
Tammy: Catholic school
was great.

1636
01:31:38,900 --> 01:31:42,301  X1:243 X2:478 Y1:358 Y2:417
I mean, the teachers
kind ofsucked,

1637
01:31:42,371 --> 01:31:44,839  X1:210 X2:512 Y1:358 Y2:420
and theywere supposedly
way more strict.

1638
01:31:44,906 --> 01:31:47,374  X1:227 X2:496 Y1:358 Y2:414
Butyou could get away
with murder.

1639
01:31:47,442 --> 01:31:50,377  X1:217 X2:503 Y1:358 Y2:414
The best thing
about Immaculate Heart

1640
01:31:50,445 --> 01:31:52,640  X1:233 X2:485 Y1:390 Y2:420
was meetingJennifer.

1641
01:31:52,714 --> 01:31:56,650  X1:245 X2:475 Y1:390 Y2:420
[ding]JenniferJuniper[ding]

1642
01:31:56,718 --> 01:31:59,915  X1:227 X2:493 Y1:390 Y2:420
[ding] Lives up on the hill [ding]

1644
01:32:04,126 --> 01:32:06,424  X1:246 X2:475 Y1:390 Y2:420
[ding] Sitting very still [ding]

1645
01:32:07,562 --> 01:32:09,496  X1:251 X2:469 Y1:390 Y2:420
[ding] Is she sleeping [ding]

1646
01:32:09,564 --> 01:32:11,031  X1:233 X2:484 Y1:358 Y2:414
Tammy:Jennifer and I
are soul mates

1647
01:32:11,099 --> 01:32:14,296  X1:229 X2:491 Y1:358 Y2:420
and we're never, ever,
ever going to be apart.

1648
01:32:14,369 --> 01:32:18,669  X1:245 X2:475 Y1:390 Y2:420
[ding]JenniferJuniper[ding]

1649
01:32:18,740 --> 01:32:22,073  X1:241 X2:478 Y1:390 Y2:414
Order! Order. Order!

1650
01:32:22,144 --> 01:32:23,873  X1:225 X2:494 Y1:358 Y2:419
Tracy: Senioryearwas
very productive for me.

1651
01:32:23,945 --> 01:32:25,537  X1:228 X2:493 Y1:390 Y2:414
Let's vote on this issue.

1652
01:32:25,614 --> 01:32:27,445  X1:206 X2:512 Y1:358 Y2:420
On top ofa very successful
student council year,

1653
01:32:27,516 --> 01:32:29,746  X1:252 X2:469 Y1:358 Y2:420
I was in the top
seventh percentile

1654
01:32:29,818 --> 01:32:31,012  X1:227 X2:492 Y1:390 Y2:420
ofmy graduating class.

1655
01:32:31,086 --> 01:32:32,212  X1:301 X2:419 Y1:390 Y2:420
Opposed?

1656
01:32:32,287 --> 01:32:33,515  X1:199 X2:519 Y1:358 Y2:417
And I got into Georgetown,
like I wanted,

1657
01:32:33,588 --> 01:32:36,056  X1:255 X2:463 Y1:390 Y2:420
with scholarships.

1658
01:32:36,124 --> 01:32:37,557  X1:299 X2:420 Y1:390 Y2:420
Approved.

1659
01:32:39,327 --> 01:32:42,524  X1:203 X2:518 Y1:358 Y2:414
But sometimes I got lonely,
and I'd think about Dave.

1660
01:32:42,597 --> 01:32:44,121  X1:257 X2:464 Y1:390 Y2:414
I missed our talks.

1661
01:32:44,199 --> 01:32:46,667  X1:219 X2:500 Y1:358 Y2:414
Maybe it could have
worked out between us.

1662
01:32:46,735 --> 01:32:47,895  X1:285 X2:435 Y1:390 Y2:414
I don't know.

1663
01:32:47,969 --> 01:32:50,938  X1:184 X2:537 Y1:390 Y2:420
I wonderwhat he's doing now.

1664
01:32:51,006 --> 01:32:55,102  X1:257 X2:463 Y1:358 Y2:414
Maybe he fiinally
fiinished his novel.

1665
01:32:55,177 --> 01:32:59,614  X1:177 X2:542 Y1:358 Y2:420
Butyou know, even with
all my myriad accomplishments

1666
01:32:59,681 --> 01:33:01,308  X1:257 X2:462 Y1:390 Y2:420
and bright future,

1667
01:33:01,383 --> 01:33:04,284  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:358 Y2:420
somehow I just didn't feel
the wayyou're supposed to feel.

1668
01:33:04,352 --> 01:33:06,343  X1:171 X2:551 Y1:390 Y2:420
Everybody else seemed so happy,

1669
01:33:06,421 --> 01:33:10,915  X1:178 X2:542 Y1:358 Y2:420
planning big parties and
signing each other's yearbooks.

1670
01:33:10,992 --> 01:33:13,119  X1:195 X2:526 Y1:390 Y2:420
Hardly anybody signed mine.

1671
01:33:13,195 --> 01:33:15,129  X1:222 X2:498 Y1:358 Y2:420
You'd think as
student body president,

1672
01:33:15,197 --> 01:33:16,789  X1:230 X2:490 Y1:358 Y2:420
I'd be the one
surrounded by friends.

1673
01:33:16,865 --> 01:33:19,231  X1:204 X2:517 Y1:390 Y2:414
But it wasn't like that at all.

1674
01:33:23,071 --> 01:33:25,938  X1:226 X2:496 Y1:358 Y2:419
Man:
Brittany Blake Fillmore.

1675
01:33:26,007 --> 01:33:27,804  X1:185 X2:536 Y1:358 Y2:417
Tracy: As far as
Mr. McAllisterwas concerned,

1676
01:33:27,876 --> 01:33:30,674  X1:182 X2:538 Y1:358 Y2:420
you might be surprised,
but I hardly thought about him

1677
01:33:30,746 --> 01:33:31,872  X1:275 X2:445 Y1:390 Y2:420
at all anymore.

1678
01:33:31,947 --> 01:33:34,848  X1:207 X2:514 Y1:358 Y2:420
Besides, nobody had heard
from him in a long time.

1679
01:33:34,916 --> 01:33:38,408  X1:197 X2:526 Y1:358 Y2:420
It was almost like he'd never
existed in the fiirst place.

1680
01:33:38,487 --> 01:33:41,183  X1:236 X2:485 Y1:390 Y2:420
Man: Tracy Enid Flick.

1681
01:33:43,258 --> 01:33:45,726  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:390 Y2:420
Tracy: When I got to Georgetown,

1682
01:33:45,794 --> 01:33:48,319  X1:168 X2:552 Y1:358 Y2:420
I thought I'd fiinally be
among people who were like me.

1683
01:33:48,396 --> 01:33:50,762  X1:223 X2:498 Y1:358 Y2:420
You know, smarter,
more ambitious people.

1684
01:33:50,832 --> 01:33:53,528  X1:203 X2:517 Y1:358 Y2:414
I was sure that fiinally
I'd make some true friends.

1685
01:33:53,602 --> 01:33:54,967  X1:240 X2:480 Y1:390 Y2:420
(All Talking At Once)

1686
01:33:55,036 --> 01:33:56,867  X1:297 X2:424 Y1:390 Y2:413
Excuse me!

1687
01:33:56,938 --> 01:33:59,031  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:390 Y2:420
Would you please be quiet?!

1688
01:33:59,107 --> 01:34:01,234  X1:226 X2:494 Y1:358 Y2:413
Tracy:
It wasn't like that at all.

1689
01:34:01,309 --> 01:34:03,174  X1:226 X2:493 Y1:358 Y2:420
A lot ofthem werejust
spoiled little rich kids

1690
01:34:03,245 --> 01:34:05,873  X1:235 X2:486 Y1:358 Y2:420
who didn't know
how lucky they had it.

1691
01:34:05,947 --> 01:34:09,246  X1:200 X2:521 Y1:358 Y2:420
That's OK. I've come to
accept that very few people

1692
01:34:09,317 --> 01:34:11,080  X1:179 X2:541 Y1:390 Y2:420
are truly destined to be special,

1693
01:34:11,153 --> 01:34:12,950  X1:242 X2:478 Y1:390 Y2:414
and we're solo fliers.

1694
01:34:13,021 --> 01:34:15,251  X1:263 X2:458 Y1:358 Y2:417
I guess it really is
like Dave said,

1695
01:34:15,323 --> 01:34:18,520  X1:214 X2:507 Y1:358 Y2:420
''Ifyou're gonna be great,
you've got to be lonely.''

1696
01:34:18,593 --> 01:34:20,618  X1:277 X2:442 Y1:390 Y2:420
(Loud Talking)

1697
01:34:22,998 --> 01:34:27,298  X1:196 X2:522 Y1:358 Y2:420
Jim: What happens to a man
when he loses everything?

1698
01:34:27,369 --> 01:34:29,701  X1:204 X2:517 Y1:390 Y2:420
Everything he's worked for.

1699
01:34:29,771 --> 01:34:33,901  X1:215 X2:506 Y1:390 Y2:420
Everything he believes in.

1700
01:34:33,975 --> 01:34:36,205  X1:233 X2:488 Y1:390 Y2:417
Driven from his home,

1701
01:34:36,278 --> 01:34:38,712  X1:252 X2:468 Y1:390 Y2:420
cast out ofsociety,

1702
01:34:38,780 --> 01:34:40,771  X1:245 X2:476 Y1:390 Y2:414
how can he survive?

1703
01:34:40,849 --> 01:34:42,282  X1:254 X2:465 Y1:390 Y2:420
Where can he go?

1704
01:34:42,350 --> 01:34:45,376  X1:277 X2:444 Y1:390 Y2:420
Right this way.

1705
01:34:45,453 --> 01:34:47,114  X1:248 X2:471 Y1:390 Y2:420
Jim: New York City.

1706
01:34:56,464 --> 01:34:59,558  X1:222 X2:500 Y1:358 Y2:414
For centuries, people
have come to New York

1707
01:34:59,634 --> 01:35:03,126  X1:243 X2:476 Y1:358 Y2:414
seeking refuge from
their troubled lives.

1708
01:35:03,205 --> 01:35:06,834  X1:229 X2:492 Y1:390 Y2:414
Now I am one ofthem.

1709
01:35:06,908 --> 01:35:08,899  X1:201 X2:520 Y1:358 Y2:420
Besides, I'd always dreamed
ofliving in New York.

1710
01:35:08,977 --> 01:35:11,104  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:390 Y2:414
All that excitement and culture.

1711
01:35:11,179 --> 01:35:14,046  X1:227 X2:495 Y1:358 Y2:420
Living in the city brings
surprises all the time.

1712
01:35:14,115 --> 01:35:16,845  X1:193 X2:528 Y1:358 Y2:414
Once in a while, I even bump
into former students ofmine

1713
01:35:16,918 --> 01:35:18,943  X1:288 X2:431 Y1:390 Y2:414
from Carver.

1714
01:35:19,020 --> 01:35:21,614  X1:215 X2:505 Y1:358 Y2:414
Oh, sure, my apartment's
a little smaller

1715
01:35:21,690 --> 01:35:23,385  X1:223 X2:497 Y1:358 Y2:417
than what I was used to
back in Omaha,

1716
01:35:23,458 --> 01:35:25,323  X1:174 X2:546 Y1:390 Y2:420
and the rent's pretty darn steep,

1717
01:35:25,393 --> 01:35:26,951  X1:193 X2:527 Y1:390 Y2:420
but it's got a lot ofcharacter.

1718
01:35:27,028 --> 01:35:28,893  X1:234 X2:484 Y1:390 Y2:420
And I'm cozy enough.

1719
01:35:31,967 --> 01:35:34,026  X1:257 X2:464 Y1:358 Y2:420
Besides, it's great
not needing a car.

1720
01:35:34,102 --> 01:35:37,128  X1:215 X2:504 Y1:358 Y2:420
And I get a lot ofreading
done on the subway.

1721
01:35:37,205 --> 01:35:39,400  X1:180 X2:540 Y1:390 Y2:420
Some days I even walk to work.

1722
01:35:41,710 --> 01:35:44,679  X1:216 X2:504 Y1:358 Y2:420
Thejob market is
pretty tight in New York,

1723
01:35:44,746 --> 01:35:47,044  X1:217 X2:504 Y1:358 Y2:417
but after hunting around
for a while,

1724
01:35:47,115 --> 01:35:49,549  X1:193 X2:528 Y1:358 Y2:420
I fiinally landed a position
in the education department

1725
01:35:49,618 --> 01:35:51,848  X1:162 X2:558 Y1:390 Y2:420
at the Museum of Natural History.

1726
01:35:51,920 --> 01:35:54,946  X1:251 X2:470 Y1:358 Y2:420
That's right.
I'm teaching again.

1727
01:35:55,023 --> 01:35:58,459  X1:202 X2:518 Y1:358 Y2:414
When a school brings
its students to the museum

1728
01:35:58,526 --> 01:35:59,515  X1:280 X2:440 Y1:390 Y2:420
on a fiield trip,

1729
01:35:59,594 --> 01:36:01,585  X1:225 X2:496 Y1:358 Y2:414
there's a staffof
both volunteer docents

1730
01:36:01,663 --> 01:36:03,597  X1:159 X2:561 Y1:390 Y2:420
and trained educators like myself...

1731
01:36:03,665 --> 01:36:06,998  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:358 Y2:414
who pick up where
the classwork leaves off.

1732
01:36:07,068 --> 01:36:09,298  X1:235 X2:485 Y1:358 Y2:420
And I've started
seeing someone new.

1733
01:36:09,371 --> 01:36:11,362  X1:255 X2:467 Y1:390 Y2:420
Her name isJillian.

1734
01:36:11,439 --> 01:36:14,237  X1:181 X2:539 Y1:358 Y2:420
She works at the museum, too,
in Signs and Signage.

1735
01:36:14,309 --> 01:36:17,005  X1:186 X2:534 Y1:358 Y2:417
She's really different
from Diane, and, I don't know,

1736
01:36:17,078 --> 01:36:19,478  X1:234 X2:488 Y1:358 Y2:419
I've never met anyone
quite like her.

1737
01:36:19,547 --> 01:36:22,311  X1:223 X2:497 Y1:358 Y2:420
Shejust got out of
a long relationship, too,

1738
01:36:22,384 --> 01:36:24,045  X1:274 X2:445 Y1:358 Y2:413
so we're trying
to take it slow.

1739
01:36:28,023 --> 01:36:30,583  X1:231 X2:490 Y1:358 Y2:420
You might ask ifI ever
saw Tracy Flick again.

1740
01:36:30,659 --> 01:36:32,388  X1:297 X2:421 Y1:390 Y2:417
Well, I did.

1741
01:36:32,460 --> 01:36:34,519  X1:302 X2:416 Y1:390 Y2:419
Just once.

1742
01:36:34,596 --> 01:36:39,795  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:358 Y2:417
I was down in Washington for
a museum educator's conference,

1743
01:36:39,868 --> 01:36:42,200  X1:218 X2:504 Y1:358 Y2:420
and I stayed an extra day
to do some sightseeing.

1744
01:36:44,873 --> 01:36:47,933  X1:205 X2:514 Y1:358 Y2:417
After an inspiring morning
on the Mall,

1745
01:36:48,009 --> 01:36:51,843  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:358 Y2:413
I was on myway to
the Holocaust Museum when...

1746
01:37:26,614 --> 01:37:28,809  X1:193 X2:527 Y1:390 Y2:414
I'll never know ifshe saw me.

1747
01:37:28,883 --> 01:37:30,510  X1:285 X2:437 Y1:390 Y2:420
Probably not.

1748
01:37:30,585 --> 01:37:33,053  X1:235 X2:485 Y1:358 Y2:417
But in that moment,
all the bad memories,

1749
01:37:33,121 --> 01:37:36,113  X1:238 X2:483 Y1:358 Y2:420
all the things I'd ever
wanted to say to her,

1750
01:37:36,191 --> 01:37:38,455  X1:216 X2:504 Y1:390 Y2:420
it all came flooding back.

1751
01:37:41,229 --> 01:37:43,356  X1:232 X2:486 Y1:358 Y2:417
My fiirst impulse
was to run over there,

1752
01:37:43,431 --> 01:37:44,693  X1:231 X2:490 Y1:390 Y2:420
pound on herwindow,

1753
01:37:44,766 --> 01:37:47,132  X1:195 X2:524 Y1:358 Y2:420
and demand that she admit
she tore down those posters

1754
01:37:47,202 --> 01:37:50,535  X1:191 X2:530 Y1:358 Y2:420
and lied and cheated herway
into winning that election.

1755
01:37:50,605 --> 01:37:55,736  X1:259 X2:461 Y1:358 Y2:420
But, instead,
I just stood there.

1756
01:37:55,810 --> 01:38:00,440  X1:187 X2:534 Y1:358 Y2:420
And I suddenly realized
I wasn't angry at her anymore.

1757
01:38:00,515 --> 01:38:03,382  X1:233 X2:487 Y1:390 Y2:420
I just felt sorry for her.

1758
01:38:03,451 --> 01:38:05,578  X1:243 X2:480 Y1:358 Y2:420
I mean, when I think
about my new life

1759
01:38:05,653 --> 01:38:07,985  X1:249 X2:470 Y1:358 Y2:420
and all the exciting
things I'm doing,

1760
01:38:08,056 --> 01:38:10,923  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:358 Y2:414
and then I think about
what her life must be like--

1761
01:38:10,992 --> 01:38:13,620  X1:222 X2:500 Y1:358 Y2:420
probably still getting up
at 5:00 in the morning

1762
01:38:13,695 --> 01:38:16,061  X1:230 X2:490 Y1:358 Y2:414
to pursue her pathetic
little dreams--

1763
01:38:16,131 --> 01:38:18,759  X1:241 X2:480 Y1:390 Y2:420
itjust makes me sad.

1764
01:38:18,833 --> 01:38:22,291  X1:212 X2:510 Y1:358 Y2:420
I mean where is she really
trying to get to anyway?

1765
01:38:22,370 --> 01:38:25,134  X1:179 X2:540 Y1:390 Y2:420
What is she doing in that limo?

1766
01:38:25,206 --> 01:38:28,539  X1:250 X2:469 Y1:358 Y2:414
Who the fuck does
she think she is?!

1767
01:38:31,579 --> 01:38:33,103  X1:275 X2:445 Y1:390 Y2:418
(Tires Screech)

1768
01:38:37,318 --> 01:38:40,651  X1:249 X2:473 Y1:390 Y2:419
Man: Hey, you! Hey!

1769
01:38:40,722 --> 01:38:42,883  X1:287 X2:431 Y1:390 Y2:414
You asshole!

1770
01:38:42,957 --> 01:38:45,289  X1:242 X2:477 Y1:358 Y2:420
Jim: But that's all
ancient history now.

1771
01:38:45,360 --> 01:38:47,828  X1:218 X2:502 Y1:390 Y2:420
I've got a whole new life.

1772
01:38:47,896 --> 01:38:50,296  X1:237 X2:483 Y1:358 Y2:420
I mean, that's what's
great about America.

1773
01:38:50,365 --> 01:38:51,730  X1:210 X2:508 Y1:390 Y2:420
You can always start over.

1774
01:38:51,800 --> 01:38:54,064  X1:220 X2:500 Y1:358 Y2:420
So would that make this
an igneous rock

1775
01:38:54,135 --> 01:38:56,365  X1:228 X2:493 Y1:390 Y2:420
or a sedimentary rock?

1776
01:38:56,438 --> 01:38:58,235  X1:234 X2:486 Y1:358 Y2:420
What's the difference
between igneous

1777
01:38:58,306 --> 01:38:59,739  X1:212 X2:509 Y1:390 Y2:420
and sedimentary anyway?

1778
01:39:09,984 --> 01:39:12,524  X1:277 X2:443 Y1:390 Y2:420
Jim: Anybody?

1779
01:39:15,561 --> 01:39:18,325  X1:258 X2:464 Y1:358 Y2:420
[ding] I want to know

1780
01:39:18,397 --> 01:39:21,332  X1:260 X2:461 Y1:358 Y2:419
[ding] I want to go
to school again [ding]

1781
01:39:21,400 --> 01:39:24,699  X1:276 X2:444 Y1:390 Y2:420

1782
01:39:24,770 --> 01:39:27,796  X1:266 X2:454 Y1:390 Y2:419

1783
01:39:27,873 --> 01:39:30,865  X1:219 X2:503 Y1:358 Y2:419
[ding] Long before
the school bells chime [ding]

1784
01:39:30,943 --> 01:39:34,572  X1:269 X2:453 Y1:358 Y2:419
[ding] I'll be there
ahead oftime [ding]

1785
01:39:34,646 --> 01:39:39,447  X1:208 X2:513 Y1:390 Y2:420
[ding]Just to see my teacher[ding]

1786
01:39:39,518 --> 01:39:42,851  X1:246 X2:476 Y1:358 Y2:419
[ding] Start right

1787
01:39:42,921 --> 01:39:44,889  X1:231 X2:490 Y1:390 Y2:420
[ding] Don't miss a thing [ding]

1788
01:39:44,957 --> 01:39:46,185  X1:262 X2:459 Y1:390 Y2:419
[ding] I want to get [ding]

1789
01:39:46,258 --> 01:39:51,161  X1:235 X2:488 Y1:358 Y2:419

1790

1791
01:39:55,868 --> 01:39:58,166  X1:231 X2:489 Y1:358 Y2:420
[ding]Then you'll know
you taught me right [ding]

1792
01:39:58,237 --> 01:40:03,038  X1:237 X2:486 Y1:358 Y2:420
[ding]Teacher, teacher,

1793

1794

1796
