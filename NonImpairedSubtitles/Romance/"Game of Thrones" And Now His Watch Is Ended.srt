2
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,740
3x04
And Now His Watch is Ended

3
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:07,943
<i>How many of those fingers</i>

4
00:02:07,977 --> 00:02:10,378
<i>do you think we could</i>
<i>shove up his ass?</i>

5
00:02:10,413 --> 00:02:12,147
<i>Depends if he's
had any practice.</i>

6
00:02:12,181 --> 00:02:16,150
Is that the sort of thing you and
your sister go in for, Kingslayer?

7
00:02:16,184 --> 00:02:19,920
She loosened you up for us?

8
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,361
He's going to fall.

9
00:02:28,395 --> 00:02:30,997
He's going to fall off his horse.
Someone help him.

10
00:02:40,238 --> 00:02:42,072
Water.

11
00:02:42,106 --> 00:02:44,107
Water.

12
00:02:44,141 --> 00:02:46,742
Please, water.

13
00:02:47,611 --> 00:02:49,278
Wa-water.

14
00:02:49,312 --> 00:02:50,946
Water, please.

15
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:52,880
Please. Please.

16
00:03:00,455 --> 00:03:02,422
If I die,
you won't be getting--

17
00:03:02,457 --> 00:03:03,890
Oh, enough.

18
00:03:03,924 --> 00:03:06,025
Here.

19
00:03:11,864 --> 00:03:15,232
Can't say that I've ever seen a
man drink horse piss that fast.

20
00:03:42,324 --> 00:03:44,525
Stop!

21
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:53,832
Far enough.

22
00:04:24,157 --> 00:04:27,860
Do that again
and I'll take your other hand.

23
00:04:31,698 --> 00:04:34,099
Come on, you.

24
00:04:43,942 --> 00:04:46,409
Oh, Lord Tyrion.
Come in, come in.

25
00:04:46,443 --> 00:04:48,545
I hope we might speak.

26
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,247
In confidence.

27
00:04:51,281 --> 00:04:54,183
Oh, always in confidence.

28
00:04:54,218 --> 00:04:55,952
About the events
of the Blackwater.

29
00:04:57,588 --> 00:04:58,954
Perhaps this is the wrong time?

30
00:04:58,989 --> 00:05:00,857
Oh, no.
It's a wonderful time.

31
00:05:01,925 --> 00:05:03,559
I thought one
of your little birds

32
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:06,361
might have knowledge of
my sister's intentions to--

33
00:05:06,396 --> 00:05:07,863
End your life?

34
00:05:07,897 --> 00:05:10,732
I didn't inherit
Littlefinger's spies

35
00:05:10,766 --> 00:05:12,300
along with his position,
I'm afraid.

36
00:05:12,334 --> 00:05:14,368
Which is why I'm coming to you.

37
00:05:14,403 --> 00:05:16,637
- I need proof.
- Proof?

38
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:19,072
- Will there be a trial?
- I need to know.

39
00:05:20,108 --> 00:05:23,209
I have no proof, only whispers.

40
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:29,815
Before all this nastiness,

41
00:05:29,849 --> 00:05:33,418
I was going to tell you
the story of how I was cut.

42
00:05:33,453 --> 00:05:35,154
Do you want to hear it still?

43
00:05:35,188 --> 00:05:37,589
I don't know.
Do I?

44
00:05:37,623 --> 00:05:40,358
As a boy, I travelled
with a troupe of actors

45
00:05:40,392 --> 00:05:42,360
through the Free Cities.

46
00:05:42,395 --> 00:05:44,162
One day in Myr,

47
00:05:44,196 --> 00:05:47,031
a certain man
made my master an offer

48
00:05:47,065 --> 00:05:49,133
too tempting to refuse.

49
00:05:49,167 --> 00:05:51,735
I feared the man meant
to use me as I'd heard

50
00:05:51,769 --> 00:05:53,770
some men used small boys.

51
00:05:53,804 --> 00:05:56,506
But what he wanted
was far worse.

52
00:05:57,775 --> 00:05:59,175
He gave me a potion

53
00:05:59,209 --> 00:06:01,310
that made me powerless
to move or speak,

54
00:06:01,344 --> 00:06:04,346
yet did nothing
to dull my senses.

55
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,781
With a hooked blade
he sliced me,

56
00:06:06,816 --> 00:06:09,751
root and stem,
chanting all the while.

57
00:06:09,785 --> 00:06:13,387
He burned my parts
in a brazier.

58
00:06:13,422 --> 00:06:14,956
The flames turned blue

59
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:18,659
and I heard a voice
answer his call.

60
00:06:23,564 --> 00:06:27,166
I still dream of that night.

61
00:06:27,201 --> 00:06:29,635
Not of the sorcerer,

62
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:31,937
not of his blade.

63
00:06:31,972 --> 00:06:34,406
I dream of the voice
from the flames.

64
00:06:34,441 --> 00:06:36,642
Was it a god?
A demon?

65
00:06:36,676 --> 00:06:38,344
A conjuror's trick?

66
00:06:38,378 --> 00:06:40,512
I don't know.

67
00:06:40,547 --> 00:06:44,016
But the sorcerer called
and a voice answered.

68
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:46,451
And ever since that day,

69
00:06:46,486 --> 00:06:50,255
I have hated magic and
all those who practice it.

70
00:06:50,289 --> 00:06:52,691
But you can see
why I was eager to aid

71
00:06:52,725 --> 00:06:56,093
in your fight against
Stannis and his Red Priestess.

72
00:06:56,128 --> 00:06:59,830
A symbolic revenge of sorts.

73
00:06:59,864 --> 00:07:03,900
Yes, ahem. I feel the
need for actual revenge

74
00:07:03,934 --> 00:07:05,935
against the actual person

75
00:07:05,969 --> 00:07:08,469
who tried to have me killed.

76
00:07:08,504 --> 00:07:11,839
Which will require a degree
of influence, which--

77
00:07:11,873 --> 00:07:14,207
You do not possess

78
00:07:14,242 --> 00:07:16,943
at the moment.

79
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:19,279
But influence is largely

80
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:22,448
a matter of patience,
I have found.

81
00:07:22,482 --> 00:07:25,851
Once I had served
the sorcerer's purpose,

82
00:07:25,885 --> 00:07:28,453
he threw me out
of his house to die.

83
00:07:28,488 --> 00:07:31,223
I resolved to live

84
00:07:31,257 --> 00:07:32,690
to spite him.

85
00:07:32,725 --> 00:07:34,258
<i>I begged.</i>

86
00:07:34,293 --> 00:07:37,494
I sold what parts
of my body remained to me.

87
00:07:37,528 --> 00:07:39,863
I became an excellent thief

88
00:07:39,897 --> 00:07:43,265
and soon learned that the
contents of a man's letters

89
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:47,368
<i>are more valuable than the
contents of his purse.</i>

90
00:07:47,403 --> 00:07:49,838
Step by step,

91
00:07:49,872 --> 00:07:52,640
one distasteful task
after another,

92
00:07:52,674 --> 00:07:56,143
I made my way
from the slums of Myr

93
00:07:56,178 --> 00:07:59,413
to the small council chamber.

94
00:08:01,383 --> 00:08:04,284
Influence grows like a weed.

95
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:08,054
I tended mine patiently

96
00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:11,457
until its tendrils
reached from the Red Keep

97
00:08:11,492 --> 00:08:14,827
all the way across
to the far side of the world

98
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:18,797
where I managed to wrap
them around something

99
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:20,932
very special.

100
00:08:25,537 --> 00:08:28,605
The sorcerer.

101
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,074
Hello, my old friend.

102
00:08:32,108 --> 00:08:35,276
<i>It's been a long time.</i>

103
00:08:35,311 --> 00:08:38,479
I have no doubt
the revenge you want

104
00:08:38,514 --> 00:08:40,081
will be yours in time...

105
00:08:40,115 --> 00:08:43,150
if you have the stomach for it.

106
00:08:46,154 --> 00:08:48,554
When people talk about
the Night's Watch,

107
00:08:48,589 --> 00:08:51,023
they never mention
the shoveling.

108
00:08:51,058 --> 00:08:53,292
Or the shit.

109
00:08:53,326 --> 00:08:56,027
They tell you about honor,
pardoning crimes,

110
00:08:56,061 --> 00:08:57,461
and protecting the realm,

111
00:08:57,495 --> 00:09:01,831
but shoveling
really is most of it.

112
00:09:01,866 --> 00:09:05,568
And getting attacked
or killed or worse.

113
00:09:05,602 --> 00:09:08,070
And that. But when you're not
getting attacked or killed,

114
00:09:08,104 --> 00:09:09,404
usually you're shoveling.

115
00:09:09,438 --> 00:09:12,207
Oh, look.

116
00:09:12,241 --> 00:09:13,975
More shit.

117
00:09:15,144 --> 00:09:16,910
I was starting
to wonder what to do

118
00:09:16,945 --> 00:09:18,712
with the rest of my day.

119
00:09:18,747 --> 00:09:21,081
We need to get out of here.

120
00:09:22,316 --> 00:09:24,617
When the Lord Commander
says we go, we go.

121
00:09:24,652 --> 00:09:27,586
The Lord Commander told us to go
to the Fist of the First Men.

122
00:09:27,621 --> 00:09:30,421
- How'd that turn out for us?
- He had no way of knowing.

123
00:09:30,456 --> 00:09:31,923
We do now.

124
00:09:31,957 --> 00:09:33,658
We know what's out there.

125
00:09:33,692 --> 00:09:36,727
Craster's been out here
surviving.

126
00:09:36,761 --> 00:09:39,363
So he's your new protector now?

127
00:09:39,397 --> 00:09:40,897
Our good friend Craster?

128
00:09:40,932 --> 00:09:42,632
We're like the sons
he never had.

129
00:09:42,667 --> 00:09:45,235
<i>Mormont isn't
gonna save you.</i>

130
00:09:45,269 --> 00:09:48,605
This lummox here
isn't gonna save you.

131
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:49,973
When the walkers come calling,

132
00:09:50,007 --> 00:09:52,675
Craster will serve us up
like so many pigs.

133
00:09:54,178 --> 00:09:56,044
If we want to live...

134
00:09:58,247 --> 00:10:00,681
we'll have to look out
for ourselves.

135
00:10:02,017 --> 00:10:03,984
Shh, shh, shh.

136
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:17,661
- You woke him.
- I'm sorry.

137
00:10:19,997 --> 00:10:22,131
- He's beautiful.
- Shh!

138
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:28,704
He's beautiful.

139
00:10:28,738 --> 00:10:30,772
<i>Does he have a name?</i>

140
00:10:30,806 --> 00:10:34,408
- No.
- Are you going to give him one?

141
00:10:34,442 --> 00:10:35,976
Why?

142
00:10:39,947 --> 00:10:42,114
Here.

143
00:10:42,149 --> 00:10:44,550
- Gilly. - You said to hold it for you
until you came back.

144
00:10:44,584 --> 00:10:46,118
- You're back.
- I wanted you to have it.

145
00:10:46,152 --> 00:10:48,119
I don't want
your stupid thimble.

146
00:10:48,154 --> 00:10:51,422
I want to save my baby's life.
Can you do that?

147
00:10:51,457 --> 00:10:53,491
Can you?

148
00:10:55,327 --> 00:10:57,427
I don't have time for you.

149
00:10:57,462 --> 00:10:59,762
I don't have time
for anyone but him

150
00:10:59,797 --> 00:11:02,999
because he doesn't
have much time.

151
00:11:28,088 --> 00:11:30,422
You have to go after him.

152
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:32,324
How?

153
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:34,425
<i>You know how.</i>

154
00:11:57,548 --> 00:12:00,249
Brandon.

155
00:12:00,283 --> 00:12:03,685
- Mother.
- How many times have I told you?

156
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,121
- No climbing.
- Mother, I need to find it.

157
00:12:06,155 --> 00:12:07,889
- It's here. It's calling me.
- I want you to promise me.

158
00:12:07,923 --> 00:12:09,857
No more climbing.
Promise me.

159
00:12:09,891 --> 00:12:11,558
Promise me!
Promise me!

160
00:12:11,592 --> 00:12:13,894
- Mother! Mother!
- Promise me! Promise me, Bran!

161
00:12:13,928 --> 00:12:15,162
<i>Promise me!</i>

162
00:12:28,542 --> 00:12:30,509
Is he very large?

163
00:12:30,544 --> 00:12:32,311
No larger than usual,
apparently.

164
00:12:32,345 --> 00:12:35,380
- And yet they said that he was--
- Extraordinary.

165
00:12:35,414 --> 00:12:38,016
The most extraordinary man
they've ever had.

166
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:39,483
And they've had a lot of men.

167
00:12:39,518 --> 00:12:41,518
We're talking about
the same Podrick?

168
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:44,087
The quiet boy
in Lord Tyrion's service?

169
00:12:44,122 --> 00:12:45,689
Seems a bit simple?

170
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:48,725
What did he do to them?

171
00:12:48,759 --> 00:12:50,025
I don't know, my lord.

172
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:52,428
The girls are usually
quite descriptive.

173
00:12:52,462 --> 00:12:54,396
So what did they say?

174
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:57,465
They said it was hard
to describe.

175
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,067
Huh.

176
00:12:59,101 --> 00:13:03,838
Prodigies appear
in the oddest of places.

177
00:13:03,872 --> 00:13:08,075
And what did Littlefinger say
about this loss of income?

178
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:10,177
He was too preoccupied
to notice.

179
00:13:10,211 --> 00:13:12,512
He's leaving
for the Eyrie soon.

180
00:13:12,546 --> 00:13:14,046
I'm helping him prepare
for his journey.

181
00:13:14,081 --> 00:13:16,681
Ah, yes, to pursue
his enduring love

182
00:13:16,716 --> 00:13:20,218
of the Lady Arryn and the
title that comes with her.

183
00:13:20,252 --> 00:13:22,353
Sad, really.

184
00:13:22,387 --> 00:13:24,354
Is that all it takes

185
00:13:24,388 --> 00:13:27,490
to make our friend lose
interest in poor Sansa Stark?

186
00:13:28,759 --> 00:13:31,060
He hasn't spoken to her
since the last time,

187
00:13:31,095 --> 00:13:32,895
as far as I know.

188
00:13:32,929 --> 00:13:35,564
But I don't think
he's lost interest.

189
00:13:35,598 --> 00:13:37,699
What makes you say so?

190
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:42,103
- His shipboard inventory.
- Ah.

191
00:13:43,905 --> 00:13:45,406
You can read.

192
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,507
Rare for a woman
in your profession.

193
00:13:47,542 --> 00:13:50,542
- Former profession.
- Of course.

194
00:13:50,577 --> 00:13:54,145
I'm missing something obvious
you're about to point out?

195
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:56,080
<i>Two featherbeds.</i>

196
00:13:56,115 --> 00:13:58,649
He's bringing two
featherbeds for the cabin.

197
00:14:00,452 --> 00:14:02,987
Who is important enough
to Littlefinger

198
00:14:03,021 --> 00:14:05,823
to merit a featherbed
besides Littlefinger?

199
00:14:05,857 --> 00:14:08,092
Could he be bringing
one of his girls?

200
00:14:08,126 --> 00:14:10,427
He's not interested
in them, my lord.

201
00:14:10,462 --> 00:14:12,196
How do you know?

202
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:14,631
Because I'm one of his girls.

203
00:14:14,665 --> 00:14:18,100
Prodigies in odd places indeed.

204
00:14:19,469 --> 00:14:22,638
Rhaenyra Targaryen
was murdered by her brother,

205
00:14:22,672 --> 00:14:25,140
or rather his dragon.

206
00:14:25,174 --> 00:14:27,775
It ate her
while her son watched.

207
00:14:29,378 --> 00:14:32,647
What's left of her is buried in
the crypts right down there.

208
00:14:35,417 --> 00:14:38,752
<i>The ceremony is traditionally
held in the main sanctum,</i>

209
00:14:38,787 --> 00:14:42,022
which seats 700 comfortably.

210
00:14:42,056 --> 00:14:44,724
There appears to be a
good deal of room elsewhere

211
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:47,359
on the premises
for everyone else.

212
00:14:47,393 --> 00:14:50,562
There aren't more than 700
people of any importance.

213
00:14:50,596 --> 00:14:53,731
No, the rest are there
to look adoringly

214
00:14:53,765 --> 00:14:55,799
upon the 700 to remind them

215
00:14:55,834 --> 00:14:59,003
how superior they must be
to have the best seats.

216
00:14:59,037 --> 00:15:00,537
Over there in that urn,

217
00:15:00,572 --> 00:15:02,906
the ashes of Aerion Targaryen.

218
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,908
Aerion Brightflame
they called him.

219
00:15:04,942 --> 00:15:08,111
He thought drinking wildfire
would turn him into a dragon.

220
00:15:08,145 --> 00:15:11,347
He was wrong.

221
00:15:11,382 --> 00:15:13,416
And, of course,
there's the Mad King,

222
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:15,184
killed by my uncle.

223
00:15:15,219 --> 00:15:18,420
Would you like to see where the
last Targaryens are buried?

224
00:15:18,454 --> 00:15:21,423
Are you sure Lady Margaery doesn't
find all this a bit macabre?

225
00:15:21,457 --> 00:15:23,191
Oh, no, it's quite
all right, Your Grace.

226
00:15:23,225 --> 00:15:25,793
I'd love to see
their tombs, really.

227
00:15:25,827 --> 00:15:28,129
It's like taking a walk
through history.

228
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,401
- The tomb's just up here.
- This is so exciting.

229
00:15:34,435 --> 00:15:36,069
You were married
here, Your Grace?

230
00:15:36,103 --> 00:15:39,271
- Yes.
- Must seem like only yesterday.

231
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:41,072
Seems like a lifetime ago.

232
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:43,441
Your husband, was he
buried here as well?

233
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:46,577
No, he wanted his remains
returned to Storm's End.

234
00:15:46,611 --> 00:15:50,180
- Such a tragedy.
- A fairly predictable tragedy.

235
00:15:50,214 --> 00:15:51,748
Hunting and drinking don't mix.

236
00:15:51,782 --> 00:15:53,350
I should say not.

237
00:15:53,384 --> 00:15:55,452
My son's a hunter.
It helps him forget

238
00:15:55,486 --> 00:15:58,354
he's never been within
a mile of a real battle.

239
00:15:58,389 --> 00:16:01,357
I seem to recall he laid
siege to Storm's End

240
00:16:01,391 --> 00:16:02,925
for the better part of a year.

241
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:04,693
All he laid siege to

242
00:16:04,728 --> 00:16:07,029
was the banquet table
in the command tent.

243
00:16:07,063 --> 00:16:10,298
I told him to stay out
of Robert's rebellion.

244
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:13,835
He had no business
fighting an actual warrior.

245
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:17,304
We mothers do what we can

246
00:16:17,338 --> 00:16:19,506
to keep our sons
from the grave.

247
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:21,541
But they do seem
to yearn for it.

248
00:16:21,575 --> 00:16:24,309
We shower them with good sense,

249
00:16:24,344 --> 00:16:27,846
and it slides right off
like rain off a wing.

250
00:16:28,948 --> 00:16:30,849
And yet the world
belongs to them.

251
00:16:30,883 --> 00:16:33,785
A ridiculous
arrangement, to my mind.

252
00:16:37,488 --> 00:16:39,689
The gods have seen fit
to make it so.

253
00:16:41,557 --> 00:16:43,391
My father didn't
want them here.

254
00:16:43,425 --> 00:16:45,059
He was going to have
their bodies burned

255
00:16:45,094 --> 00:16:46,760
and thrown in the Blackwater,

256
00:16:46,795 --> 00:16:50,296
but the High Septon
convinced him otherwise.

257
00:16:50,331 --> 00:16:51,965
I'm glad he did.

258
00:16:53,901 --> 00:16:55,367
I'm sorry, Your Grace.

259
00:16:55,402 --> 00:16:57,135
I know they did terrible
things at the end,

260
00:16:57,170 --> 00:17:01,072
but their ancestors built this.

261
00:17:03,008 --> 00:17:04,908
Sometimes severity

262
00:17:04,942 --> 00:17:07,076
is the price we pay
for greatness.

263
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:11,414
I couldn't agree more.

264
00:17:21,024 --> 00:17:23,458
Shall we go and see them?

265
00:17:23,492 --> 00:17:25,927
If you give them your love,

266
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:29,397
they will return it
a thousandfold.

267
00:17:29,431 --> 00:17:31,933
I've spoken with them.

268
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:34,301
I know how they feel about you.

269
00:17:34,335 --> 00:17:37,771
You led the defense
of King's Landing.

270
00:17:39,273 --> 00:17:41,508
They adore you.

271
00:17:49,516 --> 00:17:52,051
Open the doors.

272
00:17:59,758 --> 00:18:01,392
Joffrey.

273
00:18:02,561 --> 00:18:04,228
Wait.

274
00:18:05,497 --> 00:18:07,164
- Lady Margaery!
- Lady Margaery!

275
00:18:07,198 --> 00:18:09,966
Bless you, Lady Margaery!

276
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,435
- Lady Margaery!
- Lady Margaery!

277
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:15,505
- <i>Margaery!</i>
- <i>Long live Lady Margaery!</i>

278
00:18:15,539 --> 00:18:18,040
<i>King Joffrey!</i>

279
00:18:20,143 --> 00:18:23,311
<i>King Joffrey!
King Joffrey!</i>

280
00:18:23,345 --> 00:18:25,446
<i>King Joffrey!</i>

281
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,748
<i>Gods bless King Joffrey!</i>

282
00:18:33,586 --> 00:18:35,487
How far is it
to Deepwood Motte?

283
00:18:35,521 --> 00:18:37,088
Not far, my lord.

284
00:18:37,122 --> 00:18:39,090
Your sister is waiting
for you there.

285
00:18:39,124 --> 00:18:40,925
- She sent you to save me?
- Yes.

286
00:18:40,959 --> 00:18:44,795
I served them, the men
who were torturing you.

287
00:18:44,829 --> 00:18:47,398
I did what they told me and
waited for the right moment.

288
00:18:47,432 --> 00:18:49,800
Why would you risk
your life for me?

289
00:18:49,835 --> 00:18:52,836
I grew up on
Saltcliffe, my lord.

290
00:18:52,871 --> 00:18:56,005
I was only a boy
when they took you away.

291
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,007
My father brought me and my
brothers up to the bluffs

292
00:18:58,041 --> 00:19:01,043
so we could watch the ship
that carried you off.

293
00:19:01,077 --> 00:19:04,112
I remember the look on my
father's face when he told us,

294
00:19:04,146 --> 00:19:06,948
"That's Balon Greyjoy's
last living son."

295
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:10,684
And those are the words
I heard over and over again

296
00:19:10,718 --> 00:19:13,019
when I saw what
they were doing to you.

297
00:19:13,053 --> 00:19:15,054
Those men,

298
00:19:15,088 --> 00:19:18,090
they said my father knew
what they were doing to me.

299
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:21,993
Did he?

300
00:19:22,027 --> 00:19:24,963
I-- I don't know,
my lord.

301
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:28,466
They-- they never
told me much.

302
00:19:37,508 --> 00:19:39,075
My sister's men
are loyal to her.

303
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:41,277
<i>We don't need</i>
<i>to hide from them.</i>

304
00:19:41,312 --> 00:19:43,346
Not all those
are your sister's men.

305
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:46,081
Some of them are loyal
to your father.

306
00:19:49,418 --> 00:19:51,418
What is it?

307
00:19:51,453 --> 00:19:53,053
I was just thinking
how jealous I was

308
00:19:53,087 --> 00:19:55,222
when my father told Yara
to take this place.

309
00:19:55,256 --> 00:19:57,023
What did he tell you to do?

310
00:19:57,058 --> 00:19:59,258
Raid fishing villages.

311
00:19:59,293 --> 00:20:01,127
He didn't trust me.

312
00:20:01,161 --> 00:20:02,928
Thought I was a Stark.

313
00:20:02,963 --> 00:20:05,898
Ha. I could never
be a Stark.

314
00:20:05,932 --> 00:20:08,400
Robb Stark always
reminded me of that.

315
00:20:08,434 --> 00:20:10,936
- He lorded it over you?
- Didn't have to.

316
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:14,138
All he had to do was be.

317
00:20:15,241 --> 00:20:18,176
Be who he was born to be.

318
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:20,678
His life fit him
better than his clothes.

319
00:20:20,713 --> 00:20:23,214
How could someone like that
ever be a brother to me?

320
00:20:23,249 --> 00:20:25,516
<i>He's the King in the North.</i>

321
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:26,850
<i>And me...</i>

322
00:20:26,885 --> 00:20:29,552
my father gave me a choice

323
00:20:29,587 --> 00:20:31,487
and I made it.

324
00:20:32,956 --> 00:20:34,824
I could never be a Stark.

325
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:38,327
But ironborn,

326
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:40,997
that's what I was born to be.

327
00:20:45,836 --> 00:20:48,437
I paid the iron price
for Winterfell.

328
00:20:55,411 --> 00:20:57,045
I murdered those boys.

329
00:21:00,182 --> 00:21:01,949
The Stark boys?

330
00:21:03,452 --> 00:21:05,052
Never found them.

331
00:21:05,087 --> 00:21:08,722
Just some poor orphans
living with a farmer.

332
00:21:11,525 --> 00:21:14,926
I let Dagmer slit their throats

333
00:21:14,961 --> 00:21:17,129
and I let him
burn the bodies...

334
00:21:18,765 --> 00:21:21,566
so I could keep Winterfell...

335
00:21:23,736 --> 00:21:26,104
and make my father proud.

336
00:21:27,072 --> 00:21:29,607
Maybe it's not too late.

337
00:21:32,677 --> 00:21:34,778
It is.

338
00:21:42,285 --> 00:21:45,820
My real father lost his head
at King's Landing.

339
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:49,891
I made a choice...

340
00:21:52,127 --> 00:21:54,461
and I chose wrong.

341
00:21:56,964 --> 00:21:59,632
And now I've burned
everything down.

342
00:22:01,268 --> 00:22:03,669
Not everything, my lord.

343
00:22:06,505 --> 00:22:07,805
She's up here.

344
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:22,717
- Yara.
- <i>Shh.</i>

345
00:22:22,752 --> 00:22:24,286
Wait.

346
00:22:32,961 --> 00:22:35,396
I brought him back.
He killed the others.

347
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:37,264
What?
No, I didn't.

348
00:22:37,298 --> 00:22:39,466
You can't!

349
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:42,202
No, please stop!

350
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:47,539
No!

351
00:22:47,573 --> 00:22:49,340
Put him back where he belongs.

352
00:23:13,896 --> 00:23:15,296
Eat.

353
00:23:19,234 --> 00:23:20,834
What are you doing?

354
00:23:21,703 --> 00:23:23,470
I'm dying.

355
00:23:23,504 --> 00:23:26,472
You can't die.

356
00:23:26,507 --> 00:23:28,808
You need to live

357
00:23:28,842 --> 00:23:31,310
to take revenge.

358
00:23:31,344 --> 00:23:33,811
I don't care about revenge.

359
00:23:33,846 --> 00:23:35,813
You coward.

360
00:23:37,148 --> 00:23:39,749
A little misfortune
and you're giving up.

361
00:23:41,318 --> 00:23:43,352
Misfor--

362
00:23:43,387 --> 00:23:44,954
misfortune?

363
00:23:44,988 --> 00:23:46,755
You lost your hand.

364
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:49,524
My sword hand.
I was that hand.

365
00:23:51,594 --> 00:23:54,095
You have a taste--

366
00:23:54,129 --> 00:23:56,830
one taste of the real world

367
00:23:56,865 --> 00:23:59,967
where people have important
things taken from them

368
00:24:00,001 --> 00:24:02,769
and you whine and cry and quit.

369
00:24:02,803 --> 00:24:05,271
You sound like a bloody woman.

370
00:24:30,961 --> 00:24:33,295
I know what you did for me.

371
00:24:34,564 --> 00:24:37,566
You told them Tarth
was full of sapphires.

372
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:43,537
It's called the Sapphire Isle

373
00:24:43,572 --> 00:24:45,740
because of the blue
of its water.

374
00:24:48,676 --> 00:24:50,843
You knew that.

375
00:24:57,984 --> 00:25:00,318
Why did you help me?

376
00:25:26,373 --> 00:25:28,107
You wanted to speak to me?

377
00:25:28,141 --> 00:25:30,509
Yes, about Jaime.

378
00:25:31,578 --> 00:25:33,178
What about him?

379
00:25:33,212 --> 00:25:34,612
I wanted to make sure

380
00:25:34,647 --> 00:25:37,081
we're doing everything
we can to get him back.

381
00:25:40,418 --> 00:25:43,286
When Catelyn Stark
took Tyrion prisoner...

382
00:25:44,889 --> 00:25:46,623
what did I do in response?

383
00:25:46,657 --> 00:25:49,692
- You started a war.
- And if I would start a war

384
00:25:49,726 --> 00:25:52,094
for that lecherous
little stump,

385
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:55,297
what do you think I am doing
for my oldest son and heir?

386
00:25:55,331 --> 00:25:57,999
Whatever you can.

387
00:25:58,034 --> 00:26:00,802
Whatever I can.

388
00:26:12,647 --> 00:26:14,915
- You're still here.
- Yes.

389
00:26:17,651 --> 00:26:20,086
Why?

390
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,520
Did it ever occur to you

391
00:26:21,554 --> 00:26:23,555
that I might be the one
who deserves your confidence

392
00:26:23,589 --> 00:26:26,057
and your trust, not your sons?

393
00:26:26,091 --> 00:26:28,960
Not Jaime or Tyrion, but me.

394
00:26:28,994 --> 00:26:31,195
Years and years
of lectures on family

395
00:26:31,229 --> 00:26:33,297
and legacy--

396
00:26:33,331 --> 00:26:34,831
the same lecture, really,

397
00:26:34,866 --> 00:26:38,168
just with tiny,
tedious variations--

398
00:26:38,202 --> 00:26:39,936
did it ever occur to you
that your daughter

399
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:43,639
might be the only one listening to them?
Living by them?

400
00:26:43,673 --> 00:26:47,242
That she might have the most
to contribute to your legacy

401
00:26:47,276 --> 00:26:50,178
that you love so much more
than your actual children?

402
00:26:57,219 --> 00:27:00,320
All right.
Contribute.

403
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:05,091
The Tyrells are a problem.

404
00:27:06,427 --> 00:27:09,695
The Tyrells helped us
defeat Stannis Baratheon.

405
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:12,998
The Tyrells saved your life,
your children's lives.

406
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,734
Margaery has her claws
in Joffrey.

407
00:27:18,537 --> 00:27:20,737
She knows how
to manipulate him.

408
00:27:20,772 --> 00:27:22,139
Good.

409
00:27:22,173 --> 00:27:24,274
I wish you knew
how to manipulate him.

410
00:27:25,676 --> 00:27:28,244
I don't distrust you
because you're a woman.

411
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:31,781
I distrust you because you're not
as smart as you think you are.

412
00:27:31,815 --> 00:27:34,584
You've allowed that boy
to ride roughshod over you

413
00:27:34,618 --> 00:27:37,587
and everyone else in this city.

414
00:27:42,593 --> 00:27:44,961
Perhaps...

415
00:27:44,995 --> 00:27:48,464
you should try stopping him
from doing what he likes.

416
00:27:52,803 --> 00:27:54,937
I will.

417
00:27:56,272 --> 00:27:58,173
<i>Do you like it, Nana?</i>

418
00:27:58,207 --> 00:28:01,075
Another golden rose.
How original.

419
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:03,511
I eat from plates
stamped with roses.

420
00:28:03,545 --> 00:28:05,746
I sleep in sheets
embroidered with roses.

421
00:28:05,781 --> 00:28:08,649
I have a golden rose
painted on my chamber pot,

422
00:28:08,683 --> 00:28:11,084
as if that makes it
smell any better.

423
00:28:11,119 --> 00:28:12,786
Roses are boring, dear.

424
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:15,355
"Growing strong."

425
00:28:15,389 --> 00:28:18,490
Ha! The dullest words
of any house.

426
00:28:18,525 --> 00:28:20,425
"Winter is coming!"

427
00:28:20,459 --> 00:28:22,494
Now that's memorable.

428
00:28:22,528 --> 00:28:25,596
"We do not sow."
Strong. Strong.

429
00:28:25,631 --> 00:28:27,665
Those are houses
you watch out for.

430
00:28:27,699 --> 00:28:31,835
Direwolves and krakens,
fierce beasts.

431
00:28:31,869 --> 00:28:33,870
But a golden rose
growing strong--

432
00:28:33,904 --> 00:28:37,273
ha, that strikes fear
in the heart.

433
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:41,743
Look, little loves.

434
00:28:41,778 --> 00:28:43,678
A spider in the garden.

435
00:28:44,814 --> 00:28:46,514
Run along now.

436
00:28:46,549 --> 00:28:48,483
Grow strong.

437
00:28:50,519 --> 00:28:52,052
My lady.

438
00:28:52,087 --> 00:28:55,422
I wanted to personally
welcome you to King's Landing.

439
00:28:55,456 --> 00:28:57,924
The city has been made
brighter by your presence.

440
00:28:57,959 --> 00:29:01,027
The city is made brighter
by my presence?

441
00:29:01,061 --> 00:29:03,429
Is that your usual line,
Lord Varys?

442
00:29:03,463 --> 00:29:05,030
Are you here to seduce me?

443
00:29:05,065 --> 00:29:06,732
A little obvious, perhaps.

444
00:29:06,767 --> 00:29:08,667
Oh, no, please.

445
00:29:08,701 --> 00:29:12,070
Seduce away.
It's been so long.

446
00:29:12,105 --> 00:29:14,472
Though I rather think
it's all for naught.

447
00:29:14,506 --> 00:29:18,142
What happens when the nonexistent
bumps against the decrepit?

448
00:29:19,344 --> 00:29:21,445
A question for
the philosophers.

449
00:29:21,479 --> 00:29:24,514
But you've come mincing
all this way for something.

450
00:29:24,548 --> 00:29:26,682
- So?
- Might I sit?

451
00:29:26,716 --> 00:29:28,617
No.

452
00:29:28,651 --> 00:29:31,819
Come, I've heard
you're such a clever man.

453
00:29:31,854 --> 00:29:34,555
I'm curious why
you've sought me out.

454
00:29:35,757 --> 00:29:38,325
You've taken an interest
in Sansa Stark.

455
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:39,492
Have I?

456
00:29:39,527 --> 00:29:41,394
Because I spoke to her
once in this garden

457
00:29:41,428 --> 00:29:44,330
and one of your little spies
came running to tell you?

458
00:29:44,365 --> 00:29:45,665
Why shouldn't I take
an interest?

459
00:29:45,699 --> 00:29:47,466
- She's an interesting girl.
- Is she?

460
00:29:47,501 --> 00:29:49,301
No, not particularly.

461
00:29:49,335 --> 00:29:51,370
But she's had
an interesting childhood.

462
00:29:51,404 --> 00:29:54,172
She has, sadly.

463
00:29:54,206 --> 00:29:56,507
Well, forgive me for wasting
your time, then.

464
00:29:56,541 --> 00:29:59,876
I thought we shared certain
hopes for her well-being.

465
00:29:59,911 --> 00:30:01,377
Come, come.

466
00:30:01,411 --> 00:30:03,979
You surrender rather easily.

467
00:30:05,482 --> 00:30:06,849
Walk with me.

468
00:30:06,883 --> 00:30:08,617
I know the walls have ears,

469
00:30:08,651 --> 00:30:10,986
but apparently
the shrubbery does, too.

470
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:13,822
I choose my allies carefully

471
00:30:13,856 --> 00:30:16,824
and my enemies
more carefully still.

472
00:30:16,858 --> 00:30:18,759
Which is Sansa Stark?

473
00:30:18,793 --> 00:30:21,595
Neither.
A babe in the woods.

474
00:30:21,629 --> 00:30:23,830
- I admired her father.
- Yes.

475
00:30:23,865 --> 00:30:25,965
Ned Stark had many admirers,

476
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,433
and how many stepped forward

477
00:30:27,467 --> 00:30:30,035
when the executioner
came for his head?

478
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:31,636
I could not help Lord Stark.

479
00:30:31,671 --> 00:30:34,906
- Perhaps I can help his daughter.
- How?

480
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:38,409
You're not the only one who
has taken an interest in her.

481
00:30:38,443 --> 00:30:40,210
That's hardly surprising.

482
00:30:40,245 --> 00:30:42,579
She's a beautiful girl
with a famous name.

483
00:30:42,613 --> 00:30:46,149
Indeed. She'd make a lovely
match for the right suitor.

484
00:30:46,184 --> 00:30:49,051
It almost feels as if you're
about to arrive at the point.

485
00:30:49,086 --> 00:30:51,720
Littlefinger is not long
for the capital.

486
00:30:51,754 --> 00:30:53,755
A confidant of mine has told me

487
00:30:53,789 --> 00:30:56,690
that when he goes,
Sansa Stark goes with him.

488
00:30:56,725 --> 00:30:59,026
And why have you come
to me with this matter?

489
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:02,863
Littlefinger was born with no
lands, no wealth, no armies.

490
00:31:02,897 --> 00:31:04,631
He has acquired the first two.

491
00:31:04,665 --> 00:31:06,399
How long before
he has the army?

492
00:31:06,434 --> 00:31:08,534
Perhaps you'll laugh,

493
00:31:08,569 --> 00:31:10,602
but I know him better than most

494
00:31:10,637 --> 00:31:12,838
and this is the truth.

495
00:31:12,872 --> 00:31:17,476
Littlefinger is one of the most
dangerous men in Westeros.

496
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:19,878
If Robb Stark falls,

497
00:31:19,912 --> 00:31:22,313
Sansa Stark is the key
to the North.

498
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:25,315
And if Littlefinger marries her,
he'll have the key in his pocket.

499
00:31:25,349 --> 00:31:27,117
Which seems such a shame.

500
00:31:27,151 --> 00:31:29,252
Why should a man
with such a low reputation

501
00:31:29,286 --> 00:31:31,254
steal away such a lovely bride?

502
00:31:31,288 --> 00:31:33,355
You must despise him.

503
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:35,523
You're working so hard
to undermine him.

504
00:31:35,558 --> 00:31:38,492
Actually, I rather enjoy him.

505
00:31:38,527 --> 00:31:40,627
But he would see
this country burn

506
00:31:40,662 --> 00:31:43,062
if he could be
king of the ashes.

507
00:31:43,097 --> 00:31:45,131
You are a clever man,
Lord Varys.

508
00:31:45,166 --> 00:31:46,699
You are too kind.

509
00:31:46,733 --> 00:31:49,668
I believe I have
a possible solution.

510
00:31:49,702 --> 00:31:51,470
One doesn't need
to be clever for that.

511
00:31:51,504 --> 00:31:53,071
It's all rather obvious,
isn't it?

512
00:32:04,515 --> 00:32:06,248
Ahem.

513
00:32:06,283 --> 00:32:08,316
I didn't mean to disturb you.

514
00:32:08,351 --> 00:32:10,084
You haven't.

515
00:32:10,119 --> 00:32:11,886
We'd like some privacy, please.

516
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:14,121
If you wouldn't mind
waiting back inside the keep.

517
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:18,558
Or if you'd be kind enough
to give me your names,

518
00:32:18,592 --> 00:32:21,494
I'll ask the king
to speak with you himself.

519
00:32:25,498 --> 00:32:27,199
What did you pray for?

520
00:32:27,233 --> 00:32:29,868
- I can't tell you.
- Why not?

521
00:32:29,902 --> 00:32:32,603
I'll tell you what I prayed
for in the sept this morning.

522
00:32:32,638 --> 00:32:36,440
Let's see, for my family's
health and happiness,

523
00:32:36,474 --> 00:32:39,709
for an end to the war,
for a short winter.

524
00:32:39,744 --> 00:32:42,378
Boring and traditional,
I'm afraid.

525
00:32:42,412 --> 00:32:46,214
- And you?
- I'm sorry, I just can't.

526
00:32:46,248 --> 00:32:47,816
My cousin Alanna

527
00:32:47,850 --> 00:32:50,385
was the most beautiful
girl I'd ever seen.

528
00:32:50,419 --> 00:32:52,553
When I was 12, I was
all elbows and knees

529
00:32:52,588 --> 00:32:55,055
and Alanna looked like a
goddess sent to torture me.

530
00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:56,890
Pig-face, she called me.

531
00:32:56,925 --> 00:32:58,792
Pig-face?
That's ridiculous.

532
00:32:58,826 --> 00:33:01,061
I think it had something
to do with my nose.

533
00:33:01,095 --> 00:33:03,496
Whenever she passed me
in the halls, she'd oink.

534
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:09,368
So I prayed that she'd catch
a horrible skin disease.

535
00:33:09,403 --> 00:33:11,837
A week after that, she came
down with porridge plague.

536
00:33:11,871 --> 00:33:14,472
- Porridge plague?
- You don't have it in the North?

537
00:33:14,507 --> 00:33:16,908
Your skin starts
to look like boiled oats

538
00:33:16,942 --> 00:33:19,743
and eventually your face slides
off and you die in agony.

539
00:33:19,777 --> 00:33:21,678
But that's awful.

540
00:33:23,881 --> 00:33:26,416
You're--

541
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:28,418
I believed you!

542
00:33:28,452 --> 00:33:30,353
Porridge plague.
I'm an idiot.

543
00:33:30,387 --> 00:33:32,588
Don't say that.
No, you're not.

544
00:33:32,623 --> 00:33:35,223
So what happened to Alanna?

545
00:33:35,257 --> 00:33:37,358
Oh, she grew up to be
the most beautiful woman

546
00:33:37,392 --> 00:33:40,327
and married a handsome lord
and they have darling children

547
00:33:40,362 --> 00:33:42,162
and live in a castle
by the sea.

548
00:33:42,196 --> 00:33:44,798
It's all terribly frustrating.

549
00:33:44,832 --> 00:33:47,534
I'm sure she's jealous
of you now.

550
00:33:47,568 --> 00:33:49,835
You'll be married
here in the capital

551
00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:53,538
and she'll have to come watch and
pretend to be happy that you're queen.

552
00:33:56,342 --> 00:34:00,111
I want us to be friends,
good friends.

553
00:34:00,146 --> 00:34:02,346
That would make me very happy.

554
00:34:03,981 --> 00:34:05,815
You must see Highgarden.

555
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:07,884
You'd love it there.
I know you would.

556
00:34:07,918 --> 00:34:10,819
We have a great masquerade the
night of the harvest moon.

557
00:34:10,854 --> 00:34:12,287
You should see the costumes.

558
00:34:12,322 --> 00:34:14,023
People work on them for months.

559
00:34:15,191 --> 00:34:17,492
I-- I don't think
the queen

560
00:34:17,526 --> 00:34:19,027
would let me leave
King's Landing.

561
00:34:19,061 --> 00:34:20,861
The Queen Regent, you mean.

562
00:34:20,896 --> 00:34:23,263
Once I marry Joffrey,
I'll be queen.

563
00:34:25,066 --> 00:34:29,369
And if you were
to marry Loras...

564
00:34:31,772 --> 00:34:35,574
Oh, your place would be at
Highgarden, wouldn't it?

565
00:34:36,609 --> 00:34:38,977
We would be sisters, you and I.

566
00:34:39,012 --> 00:34:40,945
Would you like that?

567
00:34:54,792 --> 00:34:57,426
His name was Bannen.

568
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:59,161
He was a good man,

569
00:34:59,195 --> 00:35:01,130
a good ranger.

570
00:35:01,164 --> 00:35:03,298
He came to us from--

571
00:35:04,867 --> 00:35:06,935
where did he come from?

572
00:35:06,969 --> 00:35:09,704
Down White Harbor way.

573
00:35:09,738 --> 00:35:11,872
He came to us
from White Harbor.

574
00:35:11,907 --> 00:35:14,941
Never failed in his duty.

575
00:35:14,975 --> 00:35:18,077
He kept his vows
the best he could.

576
00:35:18,111 --> 00:35:22,014
He rode far, fought fiercely.

577
00:35:24,117 --> 00:35:26,551
We shall never see
his like again.

578
00:35:26,586 --> 00:35:30,021
And now his
watch has ended.

579
00:35:31,289 --> 00:35:33,824
And now his watch has ended.

580
00:35:38,162 --> 00:35:41,430
Didn't think a broke foot
could kill a man.

581
00:35:41,464 --> 00:35:44,332
It wasn't his foot
that killed him.

582
00:35:44,367 --> 00:35:47,035
That bastard Craster
starved him to death.

583
00:35:47,069 --> 00:35:48,870
Craster's got
his daughters to feed.

584
00:35:48,904 --> 00:35:50,304
<i>You on his side?</i>

585
00:35:50,338 --> 00:35:53,407
We can't just show up
and steal all his food.

586
00:35:53,441 --> 00:35:56,076
We're brothers of the
Night's Watch, not thieves.

587
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:57,911
The day we leave,

588
00:35:57,978 --> 00:36:01,547
Craster will tap
a barrel of our wine

589
00:36:01,582 --> 00:36:04,718
<i>and sit down to a feast</i>
<i>of ham and potatoes</i>

590
00:36:04,752 --> 00:36:06,720
<i>and laugh at us</i>

591
00:36:06,754 --> 00:36:08,989
starving in the snow.

592
00:36:11,758 --> 00:36:13,693
He's a bloody wildling
is all he is.

593
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:19,731
Never knew Bannen
could smell so good.

594
00:36:30,308 --> 00:36:33,877
You have one son,
don't you, Mormont?

595
00:36:35,446 --> 00:36:37,646
I had my 99th.

596
00:36:38,849 --> 00:36:41,817
You ever meet a man
with 99 sons?

597
00:36:43,586 --> 00:36:47,088
And more daughters
than I can count.

598
00:36:47,123 --> 00:36:49,523
- I'm glad for you.
- Are you now?

599
00:36:49,558 --> 00:36:53,227
Me, I'll be glad when you
and yours have gone.

600
00:36:53,261 --> 00:36:55,329
As soon as our wounded
are strong enough.

601
00:36:55,363 --> 00:36:57,297
Ah.

602
00:36:57,331 --> 00:36:59,432
They're as strong
as they're gonna get.

603
00:37:01,334 --> 00:37:02,735
Them that's dying,

604
00:37:02,769 --> 00:37:04,870
why don't you cut their
throats and be done with it?

605
00:37:04,904 --> 00:37:06,872
<i>Hmm?</i>

606
00:37:06,906 --> 00:37:10,107
<i>Or leave them</i>
<i>if you've not the stomach</i>

607
00:37:10,142 --> 00:37:11,675
and I'll sort them myself.

608
00:37:13,011 --> 00:37:15,879
<i>Whose throat you
gonna cut, old man?</i>

609
00:37:19,316 --> 00:37:20,650
Wait outside.

610
00:37:20,684 --> 00:37:24,086
It's cold outside and
there's nothing to eat.

611
00:37:24,121 --> 00:37:25,621
My wives gave you bread.

612
00:37:25,655 --> 00:37:28,891
There's sawdust in the bread.

613
00:37:28,925 --> 00:37:30,459
You don't like it,

614
00:37:30,493 --> 00:37:32,861
you go out there
and eat the snow.

615
00:37:37,766 --> 00:37:41,601
I'd rather eat what
you've got hidden away.

616
00:37:43,704 --> 00:37:46,671
I told you to wait outside.

617
00:37:46,706 --> 00:37:48,539
He's sitting there
drinking our wine,

618
00:37:48,574 --> 00:37:50,274
eating his fill while we die.

619
00:37:51,443 --> 00:37:53,944
I gave you crows enough.

620
00:37:53,978 --> 00:37:55,245
I've got to feed my women!

621
00:37:55,279 --> 00:37:57,179
So you admit you've got
a hidden larder, then?

622
00:37:57,214 --> 00:37:58,694
How else'd you make it
through winter?

623
00:37:58,715 --> 00:38:01,718
Enough!
Out!

624
00:38:01,752 --> 00:38:03,620
I am a godly man.

625
00:38:03,654 --> 00:38:05,154
You're a stingy bastard!

626
00:38:05,188 --> 00:38:06,555
Bastard?

627
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:10,092
Out with you, you little thief.

628
00:38:10,126 --> 00:38:13,495
And you!
And you!

629
00:38:15,231 --> 00:38:17,765
Go sleep in the cold
on empty bellies.

630
00:38:20,135 --> 00:38:21,902
I'll chop the hands
off the next man

631
00:38:21,937 --> 00:38:24,271
who calls me bastard.

632
00:38:39,351 --> 00:38:40,985
You are a bastard.

633
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:47,156
A daughter-fucking,
wildling bastard.

634
00:38:55,031 --> 00:38:56,965
The gods will
curse us for this.

635
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,334
- By all the laws--
- There are no laws beyond the Wall.

636
00:39:00,369 --> 00:39:01,902
Now show us where
he hides the food

637
00:39:01,937 --> 00:39:04,037
or you'll get
the same as he did.

638
00:39:04,072 --> 00:39:06,473
Unhand her.

639
00:39:06,507 --> 00:39:08,374
I shall have your head for this.

640
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:02,188
- Quickly. Quickly.
- What's happening?

641
00:40:02,222 --> 00:40:05,790
- I'm not going out there.
- No, we have to go. Now!

642
00:40:11,062 --> 00:40:13,496
Follow me.
I know the best way.

643
00:40:15,332 --> 00:40:17,233
Come on.

644
00:40:22,872 --> 00:40:24,806
Run fast, Piggy,

645
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:27,141
and sleep well!

646
00:40:27,176 --> 00:40:30,111
I'll be cutting your throat
one of these nights.

647
00:40:35,416 --> 00:40:36,949
Can I take
this hood off yet?

648
00:40:36,984 --> 00:40:38,717
I do apologize, little lady,

649
00:40:38,752 --> 00:40:41,453
but it's better for you if you
don't see where we're going.

650
00:40:43,556 --> 00:40:45,623
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

651
00:40:46,825 --> 00:40:48,959
Halt!

652
00:40:54,397 --> 00:40:56,865
- What is it?
- Blackstrap rum.

653
00:40:57,734 --> 00:40:59,401
Ugh!

654
00:40:59,435 --> 00:41:01,703
Not easy finding
molasses in wartime.

655
00:41:01,737 --> 00:41:03,604
I'd have some.

656
00:41:07,175 --> 00:41:08,608
Let's go home.

657
00:41:25,623 --> 00:41:27,390
<i>What is this place?</i>

658
00:41:27,424 --> 00:41:30,526
Somewhere neither wolves
nor lions come prowling.

659
00:41:39,501 --> 00:41:42,303
You look like
a bunch of swineherds.

660
00:41:42,337 --> 00:41:44,372
<i>Some of us
were swineherds.</i>

661
00:41:44,406 --> 00:41:47,074
And some of us tanners
and masons.

662
00:41:47,108 --> 00:41:48,475
That was before.

663
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:50,444
You're still swineherds

664
00:41:50,478 --> 00:41:53,380
and tanners and masons.

665
00:41:53,415 --> 00:41:56,416
You think carrying a crooked
spear makes you a soldier?

666
00:41:56,451 --> 00:41:59,652
No.

667
00:41:59,686 --> 00:42:02,988
Fighting in a war
makes you a soldier.

668
00:42:03,022 --> 00:42:05,056
Beric Dondarrion?

669
00:42:05,091 --> 00:42:06,791
<i>You've seen better days.</i>

670
00:42:06,825 --> 00:42:09,360
And I won't see them again.

671
00:42:10,762 --> 00:42:12,763
Stark deserters.

672
00:42:12,797 --> 00:42:15,398
Baratheon deserters.

673
00:42:15,433 --> 00:42:17,000
You lot aren't
fighting in a war.

674
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:18,534
You're running from it.

675
00:42:18,569 --> 00:42:20,870
Last I heard, you were
King Joffrey's guard dog.

676
00:42:20,904 --> 00:42:24,773
But here you are
1,000 miles from home.

677
00:42:24,807 --> 00:42:26,508
Which of us is running?

678
00:42:26,543 --> 00:42:28,610
Untie these ropes
and we'll find out.

679
00:42:28,645 --> 00:42:32,347
What are you doing
leading a mob of peasants?

680
00:42:32,381 --> 00:42:35,182
Ned Stark ordered me
to execute your brother

681
00:42:35,216 --> 00:42:36,516
<i>in King Robert's name.</i>

682
00:42:36,551 --> 00:42:39,019
Ned Stark is dead.

683
00:42:39,053 --> 00:42:41,287
King Robert is dead.

684
00:42:41,322 --> 00:42:43,523
My brother's alive.

685
00:42:45,859 --> 00:42:47,726
You're fighting for ghosts.

686
00:42:47,761 --> 00:42:49,628
That's what we are--

687
00:42:49,662 --> 00:42:53,499
ghosts waiting for you
in the dark.

688
00:42:53,533 --> 00:42:55,900
You can't see us,

689
00:42:55,935 --> 00:42:57,869
but we see you.

690
00:42:57,903 --> 00:43:00,171
No matter whose cloak
you wear--

691
00:43:00,205 --> 00:43:02,840
Lannister, Stark,
Baratheon--

692
00:43:02,874 --> 00:43:04,875
you prey on the weak,

693
00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:07,745
the Brotherhood without
Banners will hunt you down.

694
00:43:07,779 --> 00:43:09,813
You found god?
Is that it?

695
00:43:09,848 --> 00:43:12,482
Aye.
I've been reborn

696
00:43:12,516 --> 00:43:14,483
in the light
of the one true god.

697
00:43:15,319 --> 00:43:17,019
<i>As have we all.</i>

698
00:43:17,053 --> 00:43:19,554
<i>As would any man who's seen</i>
<i>the things we've seen.</i>

699
00:43:19,588 --> 00:43:22,290
If you mean to murder me, then
bloody well get on with it.

700
00:43:22,325 --> 00:43:25,493
You'll die soon enough, dog.

701
00:43:25,527 --> 00:43:29,063
But it won't be murder,
only justice.

702
00:43:29,097 --> 00:43:31,031
<i>And a kinder
fate than you deserve.</i>

703
00:43:31,065 --> 00:43:32,565
<i>Lions you call yourselves.</i>

704
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:35,801
At the Mummer's Ford, girls
of seven years were raped

705
00:43:35,836 --> 00:43:38,069
<i>and babes still on the breast</i>

706
00:43:38,104 --> 00:43:39,771
were cut in two while
their mothers watched.

707
00:43:39,805 --> 00:43:42,073
I wasn't at the Mummer's Ford.

708
00:43:42,108 --> 00:43:44,608
Dump your dead children
at some other door.

709
00:43:44,642 --> 00:43:47,010
House Clegane was built
upon dead children.

710
00:43:47,044 --> 00:43:49,579
I saw them lay Prince Aegon
and Princess Rhaenys

711
00:43:49,613 --> 00:43:51,147
before the Iron Throne.

712
00:43:51,181 --> 00:43:52,914
Do you take me for my brother?

713
00:43:52,949 --> 00:43:55,417
Is being born Clegane a crime?

714
00:43:55,451 --> 00:43:58,486
- Murder is a crime.
- I never touched the Targaryen babes.

715
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:01,322
I never saw them,
never smelled them,

716
00:44:01,357 --> 00:44:03,224
never heard them bawling.

717
00:44:03,259 --> 00:44:06,928
You want to cut my throat,
get on with it!

718
00:44:06,962 --> 00:44:08,996
But don't call me murderer

719
00:44:09,031 --> 00:44:10,865
and pretend that you're not.

720
00:44:10,899 --> 00:44:12,934
You murdered Mycah.

721
00:44:12,968 --> 00:44:14,468
The butcher's boy.

722
00:44:14,503 --> 00:44:16,437
My friend.

723
00:44:16,471 --> 00:44:19,706
He was 12 years old.
He was unarmed.

724
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:21,107
<i>And you rode him down.</i>

725
00:44:21,141 --> 00:44:23,843
You slung him over your horse
like he was some deer.

726
00:44:23,877 --> 00:44:26,445
Aye, he was a bleeder.

727
00:44:27,614 --> 00:44:29,180
You don't deny
killing this boy?

728
00:44:29,215 --> 00:44:30,848
I was Joffrey's sworn shield.

729
00:44:30,883 --> 00:44:32,884
- The boy attacked the prince.
- That's a lie!

730
00:44:32,918 --> 00:44:36,321
I hit Joffrey.
Mycah just ran away.

731
00:44:36,355 --> 00:44:37,989
Then I should have killed you.

732
00:44:38,023 --> 00:44:41,224
Not my place
to question princes.

733
00:44:42,727 --> 00:44:44,728
You stand accused of murder.

734
00:44:44,762 --> 00:44:47,097
But no one here knows
the truth of the charge,

735
00:44:47,131 --> 00:44:49,466
so it is not for us
to judge you.

736
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:52,302
Only the Lord of Light
may do that now.

737
00:44:54,304 --> 00:44:56,972
I sentence you
to trial by combat.

738
00:44:59,042 --> 00:45:01,443
So, who will it be?

739
00:45:02,645 --> 00:45:04,379
Should we find out
if your fire god

740
00:45:04,413 --> 00:45:06,714
really loves you, priest?

741
00:45:06,748 --> 00:45:10,317
Or you, archer? What are you
worth with a sword in your hand?

742
00:45:11,753 --> 00:45:14,320
Or is the little girl
the bravest one here?

743
00:45:16,457 --> 00:45:18,424
Aye.

744
00:45:18,458 --> 00:45:20,526
She might be.

745
00:45:22,629 --> 00:45:24,697
But it's me you'll fight.

746
00:45:48,419 --> 00:45:50,921
The master says
they are untested.

747
00:45:53,190 --> 00:45:57,126
He says you would be wise
to blood them early.

748
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:59,761
There are many small cities
between here and there,

749
00:45:59,796 --> 00:46:01,897
cities ripe for sacking.

750
00:46:03,833 --> 00:46:05,867
<i>Should you take captives,</i>

751
00:46:05,901 --> 00:46:09,069
the masters will buy the healthy
ones and for a good price.

752
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:15,141
<i>And who knows?</i>

753
00:46:15,176 --> 00:46:19,278
In 10 years, some of
the boys you send them

754
00:46:19,312 --> 00:46:21,513
may be Unsullied in their turn.

755
00:46:21,548 --> 00:46:23,682
Thus all shall prosper.

756
00:47:17,227 --> 00:47:20,429
Is it done, then?
They belong to me?

757
00:47:23,452 --> 00:47:24,999
<i>It is done.</i>

758
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:26,949
_

759
00:47:27,069 --> 00:47:28,770
You hold the whip.

760
00:47:29,003 --> 00:47:33,008
_

761
00:47:54,828 --> 00:47:56,395

762

768

769

_

778
00:49:00,149 --> 00:49:01,850
Dracarys.
