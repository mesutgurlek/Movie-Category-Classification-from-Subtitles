1
00:01:45,339 --> 00:01:49,343
Sorry. Are you alright?
I'm getting my radar fixed Monday.

2
00:01:49,343 --> 00:01:51,345
- You live in New York?
- I do.

3
00:01:51,345 --> 00:01:56,350
- Lynn! There you are! I didn't see you there.
- You are shameless.

4
00:01:56,350 --> 00:02:00,287
- That woman was 6 months pregnant.
- Which is the reason I flirted with her.

5
00:02:00,354 --> 00:02:02,289
It made her day.
It made her feel really good.

6
00:02:02,356 --> 00:02:06,293
- So, it was out of compassion, right?
- I知 working on it.

7
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,295
- Good. What about the other woman?
- Blind.

8
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:11,298
- Blind.
- Blind... like love.

9
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:15,569
So what about tonight? Am I going to see you?
Should I come to the restaurant?

10
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:18,572
Tonight's not good. It's... so busy tonight.
I don't think so.

11
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:22,643
- Maybe I'll come by and surprise you.
- I don't like surprises actually, no.

12
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:24,178
Come on!

13
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,890
I知 looking to see the Chilean Sea Bass.

14
00:02:38,124 --> 00:02:39,993
- It's not on the sideboard?
- No. I see no Bass.

15
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:46,099
I知 gonna kill that son-of-a-bitch!
Fakir! Did you move my fish?

16
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:50,037
I知 talking to you.
Did you move my fish?

17
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:54,107
Could it be this one lying here
disguised as an Artic Char?

18
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:59,079
Artic Char! The other son-of-a-bitch,
Glucksman, who calls himself the fish man.

19
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:03,116
- Boss, I知 getting pissed.
- I validate that emotion. Netto, Problem!

20
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:05,152
- Yes, boss.
- Bouillabaisse?

21
00:03:05,152 --> 00:03:08,088
- In there 20 minutes.
- This pot is empty.

22
00:03:08,088 --> 00:03:14,194
- This pot is bouillabaisse-less.
- Fakir! What did I tell you?

23
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:17,130
- You got a minute, boss?
- Yeah. Where'd it go?

24
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:20,067
- Taste it.
- Tumeric.

25
00:03:20,167 --> 00:03:23,003
- No tumeric!
- How much? Three or four?

26
00:03:23,103 --> 00:03:28,075
- Four.
- You're right. Perfect. Congratulations!

27
00:03:52,098 --> 00:03:55,035
Excuse me? I知 here to meet Will.

28
00:04:00,106 --> 00:04:01,608
Of course.

29
00:04:07,114 --> 00:04:09,116
I know, I got it, I got it.

30
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:12,152
What happened to Lynn?

31
00:04:12,186 --> 00:04:14,087
I believe I baked that cake.

32
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:18,157
Light up the oven. There's
a fresh bowl of batter at the door.

33
00:04:19,159 --> 00:04:21,195
I知 an easy-going guy, right?

34
00:04:22,062 --> 00:04:25,999
I知 good to my staff. I treat them well.
Is that a mistake?

35
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:30,070
Because, an occasion, one of them has
stepped over the line and said very...

36
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,408
familiar things about my private life.
- If I didn't feel like...

37
00:04:32,482 --> 00:04:35,279
I was leading these poor women to the
slaughter one after the other...

38
00:04:35,342 --> 00:04:38,079
I could build a shute to keep a count
by the front door.

39
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:44,051
- So, warning you has no effect?
- No. It's like a Greek tragedy, isn't it?

40
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:48,121
OK guys, I've got bad news.
I知 kicking you out...

41
00:04:48,155 --> 00:04:52,059
so other people may eat.
Here are your checks.

42
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:59,031
The good news is the bar drinks
are on me. Tommy?

43
00:04:59,165 --> 00:05:01,068
- You got it.
- Thanks.

44
00:05:01,068 --> 00:05:04,837
Lady, what am I gonna do with you?
You're killing me.

45
00:05:04,937 --> 00:05:09,076
- Us? Come on!
- How about I set you up out on the patio?

46
00:05:09,076 --> 00:05:12,145
- Out on the patio?
- Before my bartender leaves his wife.

47
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:16,083
- I was divorcing her anyway.
- Restrain yourself, Tommy.

48
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:20,119
Eriko...

49
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:25,092
- Are you too busy?
- It's frantic tonight, a madhouse.

50
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:27,627
- Can you bear with me 2 minutes?
- Sure.

51
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:29,062
Alright, I'll be back.

52
00:05:32,063 --> 00:05:35,447
We got the heat going now. Billy? The
heat's gonna be up all the way around?

53
00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:39,606
I got this and the champagne
is coming in any second.

54
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:41,508
Happy Birthday to you...

55
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:45,578
Happy Birthday to you...

56
00:05:45,578 --> 00:05:50,550
Happy Birthday dear Charlotte...

57
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:56,623
Happy Birthday to you...

58
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:06,566
Everything okay?
I'll come back later.

59
00:06:11,638 --> 00:06:15,575
- Finally. I知 sorry. You alright?
- Is that Will Keane? It sure is.

60
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:22,515
He hasn't changed a bit. What did you
do, make a deal with the devil?

61
00:06:24,617 --> 00:06:31,591
- I知 sorry, do...
- Come on. It痴 Dolores Talridge.

62
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:35,628
- Dolly? I can't believe it...
- Be careful of the cocktail.

63
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:41,634
- Oh my God...
- I know.

64
00:06:41,634 --> 00:06:46,539
- Time has kicked my ass a little.
- No, don't be silly. You look wonderful.

65
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:49,642
Will... spare me the bullshit.

66
00:06:57,684 --> 00:07:02,589
Honey, are you feeling alright?
You look sort of sea foam green.

67
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:06,626
I知 fine.
It痴 him.

68
00:07:06,693 --> 00:07:09,562
- He's how old?
- Who cares?

69
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:13,633
lf he's rich as well, you might
have a fight on your hands.

70
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:20,607
I want you all to meet an old
chum of mine. He's irresistible.

71
00:07:20,674 --> 00:07:26,579
He's Will Keane. And he owns
this overpriced establishment.

72
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:31,151
Overpriced? I can't believe you'd say...
Where else are you gonna find a beet salad...

73
00:07:31,185 --> 00:07:36,623
for under 35 bucks?
- I loved the Chilean Sea Bass. I'm Shannon.

74
00:07:36,656 --> 00:07:39,559
- Shannon. Thank you.
- I知 Simon.

75
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:41,594
- Hi Simon.
- Nice to meet you.

76
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:45,565
You too.
May I ask whose birthday this is?

77
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:50,637
The birthday girl happens to be
my granddaughter, Charlotte.

78
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:56,609
It痴 not Katie's daughter?

79
00:07:56,609 --> 00:08:01,581
You bet.
She's got Katie's eyes, hasn't she?

80
00:08:02,682 --> 00:08:05,618
And talent! Forget about it.

81
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:11,591
Do you know that this kid made
from scratch all these crazy hats?

82
00:08:11,725 --> 00:08:15,662
- They're great.
- Then she got serious with mine.

83
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:18,598
- Pretty sassy, isn't it?
- Very elegant.

84
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:21,668
- Isn't it divine?
- You're not kidding about this?

85
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:23,670
Have I ever lied to you?

86
00:08:23,703 --> 00:08:26,606
No, it's wonderful.
Really wonderful work.

87
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:31,678
Do you speak?

88
00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:38,685
- Thank you.
- So, you're Katie's daughter.

89
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:41,621
- So that makes you about...
- Twenty-two and never been kissed.

90
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:46,693
No, I don't buy that.
Happy Birthday, Charlotte.

91
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:49,629
- Thank you.
- Great to see you again, Dolly.

92
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:54,701
- Great to see you, Will.
- Go right in there. There you go.

93
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:59,673
- Great seeing you. Bye.
- Be still my beating heart.

94
00:08:59,673 --> 00:09:02,709
- Or, is that yours?
- I think it's mine.

95
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:05,645
He's cute but
he's a little old for Charlotte.

96
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:09,716
- He's simply fabulous.
- How do you know him?

97
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:12,652
From Newport. He's an
old friend of your Mom's.

98
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:19,759
Thanks, Melissa. Good night.

99
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:24,597
When Will Keane comps 3 bottles of Crystal to
an underage girl, I know what'll happen.

100
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:26,633
She's not underage. She's 22.

101
00:09:26,633 --> 00:09:30,704
- I know her grandmother.
- Tell me you're not gonna date her.

102
00:09:30,704 --> 00:09:34,641
The grandmother? I promise
I知 never touching that woman.

103
00:09:34,641 --> 00:09:38,712
You know what's wrong with people like
you? Too much sex. It melts the brain.

104
00:09:38,712 --> 00:09:41,648
- Here we go.
- No worry about that around our house.

105
00:09:41,648 --> 00:09:44,684
I知 on your side. I知 the good guy.

106
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:48,621
I知 sorry. I melt
at least 3 times a week.

107
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:52,692
- Is he lucky I知 off the market or what?
- They wouldn't even look at him.

108
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:56,629
- You hear? They wouldn't look at you.
- You're going to do this, aren't you?

109
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:58,665
What is it with you two?

110
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:00,704
Will you give me some credit?

111
00:10:00,798 --> 00:10:04,704
I smile at this girl, she bushes from
head to toe. Why would I do this?

112
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:08,675
Knock it off. You'd kill
to be in his place.

113
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:20,720
- Okay bitch, I知 ready.
- Not me!

114
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:27,627
- Can we start with "good-morning"?
- My God, I知 so sorry. Who is this?

115
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:29,629
Guess.

116
00:10:32,699 --> 00:10:35,602
- You?
- I guess.

117
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:39,673
- Who'd you think it was?
- My friend, Simon.

118
00:10:39,673 --> 00:10:44,644
He always call me the morning
after to... dish.

119
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:51,651
- Do you want to talk to my grandmother?
- No, I was calling you.

120
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:54,688
- You were?
- I got this little problem.

121
00:10:54,688 --> 00:11:00,096
I thought you could help me out. I got a
Benefit coming up. One of those...

122
00:11:00,196 --> 00:11:05,567
black tie worthy cause,
lousy food kind of thing.

123
00:11:05,667 --> 00:11:13,974
And I was wondering...
I'd like you to make a hat... for me.
Actually, not for me, it's for my date.

124
00:11:13,974 --> 00:11:17,677
I don't wear hats,
except to Yankee games.

125
00:11:20,747 --> 00:11:26,720
The problem is that I don't know her hat
size and I don't want to ask her...

126
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:32,692
because it's a surprise.
- Was it that woman you were with last night?

127
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,627
No.

128
00:11:35,762 --> 00:11:39,699
Cause she had an
abnormally small head.

129
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:42,635
It might account for
the limited conversation.

130
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:47,707
I could always put in
an adjustable band.

131
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:53,680
- That's perfect. Wonderful.
- It is risky doing it this way.

132
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:58,652
You can do it. Life rewards the
courageous few. You can do this.

133
00:11:58,752 --> 00:12:02,722
Can you give me
a point of inspiration?

134
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:07,627
- Like what?
- Like an image. This hat is like...

135
00:12:07,794 --> 00:12:12,732
Like the line of a woman's hip.

136
00:12:14,768 --> 00:12:17,704
- Okay.
- When can I have it?

137
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:23,643
- Let's say... two weeks.
- Great!

138
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:28,615
- I'll give you till Thursday, 4 o'clock.
- Okay. Wow.

139
00:12:28,648 --> 00:12:30,684
One other thing...

140
00:12:30,817 --> 00:12:34,754
- you say "wow" an awful lot.
- I know.

141
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,656
You're a grown-up now.

142
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:38,658
- When is that going to stop?
- Soon.

143
00:12:38,792 --> 00:12:42,696
- I'll see you Thursday.
- Okay. Bye.

144
00:12:45,699 --> 00:12:47,667
Wow.

145
00:12:57,777 --> 00:13:02,682
- Mikey, how you doing?
- I can't complain.

146
00:13:02,716 --> 00:13:04,751
You're early, aren't you?

147
00:13:04,751 --> 00:13:07,787
In this soup, you're
better safe than sorry.

148
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:10,724
- Will Keane?
- Visitor.

149
00:13:19,766 --> 00:13:22,635
He's going to a fancy party tonight.

150
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:27,607
He's up on twenty-four.
I'll key the elevator for you.

151
00:13:35,715 --> 00:13:39,686
Tony, this was not an ace
Parmesan from Froman's...

152
00:13:39,786 --> 00:13:42,722
Tony, this was more like
a pepperino from Scarsdale...

153
00:13:42,722 --> 00:13:44,658
I know the difference!

154
00:13:44,758 --> 00:13:48,695
It痴 a different price.

155
00:13:51,731 --> 00:13:53,667
- You're late.
- I know.

156
00:13:53,767 --> 00:13:57,737
I知 so sorry. I tried to get a cab and
couldn't. I took the subway and...

157
00:13:57,737 --> 00:14:01,675
Yeah, yeah, it's alright.

158
00:14:01,775 --> 00:14:07,747
What's the point of being young and beautiful
if it's not to keep men waiting.

159
00:14:07,747 --> 00:14:10,607
In fact...

160
00:14:10,617 --> 00:14:15,655
I知 disappointed. I was looking forward to at
least another half-hour of suspense.

161
00:14:15,789 --> 00:14:21,761
- I could leave and come back.
- Too late.

162
00:14:22,662 --> 00:14:24,698
So, whaddya got?

163
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:42,749
- Try it on.
- I知 soaked.

164
00:14:42,749 --> 00:14:45,652
It痴 alright.
Go ahead. Try it on.

165
00:14:47,821 --> 00:14:51,725
You have to imagine it on your friend.

166
00:15:16,816 --> 00:15:19,719
Is it the line of a woman's hip?

167
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:22,722
- Is it?
- Yes.

168
00:15:25,659 --> 00:15:29,729
- What a shame.
- Why?

169
00:15:29,729 --> 00:15:33,667
- She stood me up.
- Who?

170
00:15:33,667 --> 00:15:38,638
My date. She called an hour ago;
said she had a cold.

171
00:15:38,738 --> 00:15:41,675
It sounded more like
the hiccups to me.

172
00:15:41,675 --> 00:15:47,647
- So, you mean you're not going to go?
- Alone? No, no...

173
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:49,683
Unless...

174
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,719
What?

175
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:54,754
No... no...

176
00:15:54,821 --> 00:15:56,690
- Wait, no... wait...
- No. Forget it.

177
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:59,726
No wait, what were you
going to say?

178
00:15:59,793 --> 00:16:01,661
I don't know. I don't know.

179
00:16:04,798 --> 00:16:06,733
You wouldn't want to go, would you?

180
00:16:08,768 --> 00:16:10,670
Great. Forget it. Thanks.

181
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:12,706
Thank you very much.

182
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:13,707
It's just...

183
00:16:15,742 --> 00:16:20,714
- You've got the hiccups!
- Are you kidding? I'd go in a heartbeat.

184
00:16:20,814 --> 00:16:22,749
- You're fabulous!
- Yeah?

185
00:16:24,784 --> 00:16:26,686
Oh dear...

186
00:16:27,721 --> 00:16:30,757
- It must be me.
- Must be.

187
00:16:32,692 --> 00:16:37,731
- Do you think I知 too old for you?
- No, I collect antiques.

188
00:16:37,764 --> 00:16:39,666
Or I aspire to.

189
00:16:42,702 --> 00:16:44,738
We appreciate it.

190
00:16:46,773 --> 00:16:50,710
I would love to go,
but I知 a disaster.

191
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:57,717
I think with a little plaster and a
little paint, you're as good as new.

192
00:17:01,788 --> 00:17:03,690
Do you wanna see the dress?

193
00:17:04,824 --> 00:17:06,726
There's a dress?

194
00:17:25,824 --> 00:17:27,926
If you need me for anything, I'll be
in the back.

195
00:19:08,848 --> 00:19:13,820
I知 curious. What made you choose
my restaurant for your party?

196
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:19,420
I had to pick a place for my party.
I read that article about you.

197
00:19:21,328 --> 00:19:23,263
- The magazine!
- The magazine.

198
00:19:24,264 --> 00:19:28,335
- It's so embarrassing.
- No. I liked it.

199
00:19:37,344 --> 00:19:40,280
You don't dance. You float.

200
00:19:41,315 --> 00:19:43,317
That's from my dad.

201
00:19:43,317 --> 00:19:48,288
I used to stand on his feet.
I was floating!

202
00:19:49,323 --> 00:19:53,260
My mom was a great dancer too.

203
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,296
But, you knew that. Maybe.

204
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:58,332
We danced a couple of times.

205
00:19:59,366 --> 00:20:03,303
Now you're dancing with me.
How weird is that?

206
00:20:04,304 --> 00:20:07,341
She was very special.

207
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:14,348
I had great parents.
I was lucky.

208
00:20:18,318 --> 00:20:20,320
Shall we do this?

209
00:20:41,308 --> 00:20:43,343
Here you go!

210
00:20:45,379 --> 00:20:49,316
- Do you want something to drink?
- Yes, champagne please.

211
00:20:49,316 --> 00:20:52,352
I'll get you one. Sit at the table
and I値l be over in a second.

212
00:21:12,339 --> 00:21:16,343
I had to come. I work at the museum.
What's your excuse?

213
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:20,314
- A date... sort of.
- With Will Keane, right?

214
00:21:20,347 --> 00:21:25,352
- Yeah, do you know him?
- Only by reputation.

215
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,323
- I知 Lisa Biloy.
- I知 Charlotte.

216
00:21:29,323 --> 00:21:31,258
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

217
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:34,294
What's he like?

218
00:21:38,398 --> 00:21:42,302
Damn it, I see a huge donor
disappearing. I gotta go.

219
00:21:42,336 --> 00:21:44,304
- Enjoy yourself.
- Yes, you too.

220
00:21:54,414 --> 00:21:57,417
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

221
00:21:57,417 --> 00:22:01,355
- Who was that?
- Lisa somebody.

222
00:22:08,362 --> 00:22:11,398
- Here's to...
- Us!

223
00:22:17,371 --> 00:22:20,307
Some people star to fall
into recognizable patterns.

224
00:22:20,407 --> 00:22:24,278
The next step is that... immediately...
you know people...

225
00:22:24,378 --> 00:22:29,216
on sight. And if it's a woman...
it's a romance, forget it. It's just...

226
00:22:29,349 --> 00:22:34,254
this majorly chilling effect 'cause
you know exactly in the beginning...

227
00:22:34,421 --> 00:22:36,323
what's going to happen in the end.

228
00:22:37,357 --> 00:22:43,330
What I like about you is I find you...
completely unprecedented...

229
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:47,267
and therefore, utterly unpredictable.

230
00:22:49,303 --> 00:22:54,274
God! That must be a relief.

231
00:22:54,374 --> 00:22:56,310
What?

232
00:22:56,410 --> 00:23:01,381
To finally deliver that speech to a
woman and have it apply to there.

233
00:23:01,381 --> 00:23:06,353
Because, coincidentally,
I am all those things you just said.

234
00:23:06,353 --> 00:23:09,389
- Yes.
- And so much more.

235
00:23:09,389 --> 00:23:13,327
My yoga teacher calls me a "unique".

236
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:15,362
- Come again?
- A unique.

237
00:23:15,362 --> 00:23:18,398
A unique. He's a very wise man.
Are you sure he's not hitting on you?

238
00:23:18,398 --> 00:23:22,302
It痴 a woman! You are what
she would call a "typical".

239
00:23:22,369 --> 00:23:24,238
- Really?
- Yes! Really.

240
00:23:25,305 --> 00:23:30,310
I can prove it too.
You want me to?

241
00:23:30,377 --> 00:23:32,346
- Okay, try.
- Alright...

242
00:23:34,314 --> 00:23:36,283
Come here.

243
00:23:41,421 --> 00:23:43,290
I知 serious.

244
00:23:44,358 --> 00:23:46,326
Closer.

245
00:23:49,329 --> 00:23:51,298
Closer...

246
00:23:55,402 --> 00:23:57,271
Close enough?

247
00:23:59,373 --> 00:24:03,377
Yes. I was hoping
gravity would do the rest.

248
00:24:14,354 --> 00:24:17,357
Maybe I am "typical".

249
00:24:25,365 --> 00:24:27,267
We should go.

250
00:24:39,346 --> 00:24:42,416
I can smell the rain.

251
00:24:46,353 --> 00:24:49,289
When did I learn how to do that?

252
00:24:56,396 --> 00:24:58,298
What should we do, Will...

253
00:25:01,368 --> 00:25:04,271
with this moment that we're in?

254
00:26:08,368 --> 00:26:11,371
Boy, do you look guilty.

255
00:26:11,405 --> 00:26:13,340
I知 thinking.

256
00:26:15,375 --> 00:26:18,412
- You hungry?
- Yep.

257
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:29,289
Didn't anyone ever tell you
it was bad manners...

258
00:26:29,289 --> 00:26:33,360
to stare at a girl
while she's eating like a pig?

259
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:48,342
This isn't right.

260
00:26:51,411 --> 00:26:53,313
You... you are...

261
00:26:54,348 --> 00:26:56,350
Young.

262
00:26:56,383 --> 00:26:59,419
Yes, and I am...

263
00:26:59,419 --> 00:27:01,321
Old.

264
00:27:01,455 --> 00:27:03,357
- Older.
- Much older.

265
00:27:03,423 --> 00:27:05,392
Alright, much older.  The point is...

266
00:27:10,364 --> 00:27:14,301
Look, I could put this off,
but I genuinely like you.

267
00:27:14,401 --> 00:27:19,373
I want to be clear from the start, so
there's no confusion later on, okay?

268
00:27:21,408 --> 00:27:24,344
What I want to say to you is that...

269
00:27:25,379 --> 00:27:28,415
all I知 able to offer you...

270
00:27:28,415 --> 00:27:33,353
is this... what we have right now.
Nothing more.

271
00:27:33,353 --> 00:27:36,290
Until it ends.

272
00:27:38,325 --> 00:27:41,395
What I mean is..

273
00:27:41,395 --> 00:27:44,298
we have no future.

274
00:27:46,366 --> 00:27:48,368
I know.

275
00:27:55,375 --> 00:27:57,411
I知 sick.

276
00:28:00,347 --> 00:28:02,349
What do you mean?

277
00:28:02,349 --> 00:28:05,419
It痴 my heart.

278
00:28:05,419 --> 00:28:10,357
Nobody even thought I'd last this long.

279
00:28:13,427 --> 00:28:16,363
I could've put off telling you but...

280
00:28:16,363 --> 00:28:19,399
I genuinely like you.

281
00:28:19,399 --> 00:28:23,337
I wanted to be clear
right from the start...

282
00:28:23,337 --> 00:28:28,408
so there was no chance
for any confusion later.

283
00:28:30,444 --> 00:28:35,415
She's the perfect woman. Young,
beautiful and on her way out.

284
00:28:35,415 --> 00:28:39,353
- Not funny, John.
- I know it's not. It痴 sad.

285
00:28:40,387 --> 00:28:43,423
- She's so young.
- No, I mean you're sad.

286
00:28:43,423 --> 00:28:46,460
Even this, as far as it's gone.
You shouldn't be doing this.

287
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:49,396
- Why not?
- 'Cause it's out of whack.

288
00:28:50,531 --> 00:28:52,432
It doesn't feel totally out of whack.

289
00:28:52,466 --> 00:28:56,403
It doesn't feel totally out of whack
to you because you're looking at her.

290
00:28:56,403 --> 00:29:00,440
I知 looking at you and it's fucked.
There ain't a right angle in it.

291
00:29:02,476 --> 00:29:05,412
Alright... I end it.

292
00:29:06,446 --> 00:29:08,482
I don't know.

293
00:29:08,482 --> 00:29:11,385
Make up your mind!
What do you want me to do?

294
00:29:11,518 --> 00:29:16,456
I don't know. Maybe it's a good thing.
Maybe it makes a sad girl happy and

295
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:22,463
a desperate guy think. Anyway you look
at it, one thing... treat her nice.

296
00:29:23,464 --> 00:29:25,432
What do you mean, "desperate"?

297
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,368
Treat her nice.

298
00:30:21,522 --> 00:30:28,395
- Well, well...
- Well, well...

299
00:30:28,395 --> 00:30:30,430
She'll be right down.

300
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:34,368
She's upstairs, gilding the lily,
so to speak.

301
00:30:35,502 --> 00:30:39,439
- He's here!
- I知 coming!

302
00:30:39,439 --> 00:30:42,376
Now, come on. Do come in.

303
00:30:42,509 --> 00:30:44,411
These are for you, Dolly.

304
00:30:44,411 --> 00:30:47,481
Thank you very much.

305
00:30:48,482 --> 00:30:51,418
They are "Loverly".

306
00:30:52,419 --> 00:30:55,455
Aren't they... lovely?

307
00:30:57,491 --> 00:31:00,427
Care for a "cock-i-tail"?

308
00:31:00,561 --> 00:31:02,463
- Yeah, sure.
- Scotch?

309
00:31:02,463 --> 00:31:05,499
- Neat, please.
- My kind of guy.

310
00:31:06,533 --> 00:31:11,472
Sorry about the mess.
My maid died 14 years ago...

311
00:31:11,505 --> 00:31:15,442
and I have found it absolutely
impossible to replace her.

312
00:31:17,478 --> 00:31:21,415
What can I say, Will?
Time is a thief.

313
00:31:21,515 --> 00:31:25,486
One day, you're rich as an Arab.

314
00:31:25,486 --> 00:31:31,458
Next day, you're lucky
if you can afford pistachio nuts.

315
00:31:41,502 --> 00:31:48,442
It痴 funny. Most of us are young for
what? About a minute and a half?

316
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:54,481
Not Katie.
Katie will be young forever.

317
00:31:55,482 --> 00:31:58,552
So will the guy she married.

318
00:31:58,552 --> 00:32:02,422
I console myself
with that idea sometimes.

319
00:32:07,561 --> 00:32:12,533
Who'd have thought
what time had in store for her.

320
00:32:13,534 --> 00:32:17,437
I知 sorry. I should have
called after the accident.

321
00:32:17,504 --> 00:32:19,506
Then, on the other hand...

322
00:32:19,506 --> 00:32:23,410
time is in love with some people.

323
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:26,446
Like you, for instance.

324
00:32:26,446 --> 00:32:29,516
You look exactly the same!

325
00:32:29,516 --> 00:32:32,419
- Please...
- Handsome as ever.

326
00:32:32,486 --> 00:32:37,391
And up to your old tricks...
looks like to me.

327
00:32:40,494 --> 00:32:43,363
- Look, Dolly...
- Leave her alone!

328
00:32:44,498 --> 00:32:46,433
She's sick.

329
00:32:47,434 --> 00:32:50,471
Will, she's really sick.

330
00:32:58,512 --> 00:33:01,415
- What are you guys talking about?
- Nothing.

331
00:33:01,548 --> 00:33:04,485
Just how much you look
like your mom, is all.

332
00:33:05,486 --> 00:33:07,521
Yes... Yes, you do.

333
00:33:08,522 --> 00:33:10,557
Are you ready?

334
00:33:13,494 --> 00:33:16,430
Yes. Bye Dolly.

335
00:33:17,564 --> 00:33:19,466
Don't listen to her.

336
00:33:19,466 --> 00:33:21,502
Have fun!

337
00:33:28,509 --> 00:33:32,446
You gotta look on the bright side.
lf I wasn't sick...

338
00:33:32,446 --> 00:33:36,350
this would not work. There is no way
that we would be sitting here.

339
00:33:36,517 --> 00:33:39,453
We're totally wrong for each other.

340
00:33:40,454 --> 00:33:43,390
We're totally wrong for each other.
I know. I could be your father.

341
00:33:44,525 --> 00:33:48,462
I prefer, Uncle.

342
00:33:51,532 --> 00:33:53,433
Do you think we should break this off?

343
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:02,442
Afraid you might feel something?

344
00:34:08,549 --> 00:34:10,450
Well, look at it this way.

345
00:34:10,484 --> 00:34:13,520
We can have it real,
which we both know is way better.

346
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:16,557
And, you wouldn't have
to pay full price...

347
00:34:16,557 --> 00:34:18,492
because, in a year or so...

348
00:34:18,592 --> 00:34:23,397
I'd be just this sob story
you could use to bag more chicks.

349
00:34:24,398 --> 00:34:27,468
That is a pathetic characterization.

350
00:34:27,468 --> 00:34:30,370
I don't know. I don't accept that.

351
00:34:31,472 --> 00:34:34,441
The stench of truth.

352
00:34:48,489 --> 00:34:52,392
"O world, I cannot hold
thee close enough!

353
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:56,430
Thy winds, they wide grey skies!

354
00:34:56,430 --> 00:35:00,501
Thy mists, that roll and rise!"

355
00:35:01,502 --> 00:35:06,473
It does feel like rain. You wanna get a
cup of coffee, and go to the West side?

356
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:09,409
No, no. You'd abandon the universe...

357
00:35:09,543 --> 00:35:16,517
and me for a cafe late? No, let's not do
it. Let's not do no thoughtless thing.

358
00:35:22,389 --> 00:35:26,460
We can't talk about
he fact that you're sick?

359
00:35:27,461 --> 00:35:30,397
I知 right here, right now.

360
00:35:30,397 --> 00:35:32,432
Let's talk about you.

361
00:35:32,432 --> 00:35:35,469
- Come on, 49 years...
- 48!

362
00:35:35,469 --> 00:35:41,441
All right, 48 years. Come on,
tell me about it. Give it. Share it.

363
00:35:45,512 --> 00:35:50,484
You look at me in a way
that I haven't quite earned.

364
00:35:51,485 --> 00:35:53,520
Then earn it.

365
00:35:54,555 --> 00:35:56,457
Earn it, please.

366
00:35:57,591 --> 00:35:59,393
What do you want me to do?

367
00:35:59,493 --> 00:36:01,428
I知 yours. What is it?

368
00:36:05,499 --> 00:36:07,401
What are you doing?

369
00:36:07,501 --> 00:36:09,436
I知 keeping it.

370
00:36:11,472 --> 00:36:14,508
- This is my watch.
- Yep.

371
00:36:14,508 --> 00:36:19,480
- When do I get it back?
- When you forget that I have it.

372
00:36:30,424 --> 00:36:32,459
Mix this up a little bit...

373
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:35,496
Sorry...

374
00:36:38,432 --> 00:36:40,400
What?

375
00:36:40,467 --> 00:36:42,469
Your mother used to do that.

376
00:36:42,503 --> 00:36:44,471
- Really?
- Yep.

377
00:36:44,505 --> 00:36:49,476
That's how we met. I was a waiter...

378
00:36:49,476 --> 00:36:54,448
at the Beach Club. Whenever I'd pass
with a tray, she's steal the garnish.

379
00:36:54,448 --> 00:36:56,483
What else did she do?

380
00:36:57,484 --> 00:36:59,520
What do you mean?

381
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,456
I don't know. Little things.

382
00:37:04,591 --> 00:37:07,461
She'd eat her ice cream with a fork.

383
00:37:07,528 --> 00:37:09,496
- Really?
- Really. Yeah.

384
00:37:11,498 --> 00:37:14,535
She wrote great letters...

385
00:37:14,535 --> 00:37:17,504
But she couldn't spell.

386
00:37:22,476 --> 00:37:27,447
She was a McGovern Democrat
but incredibly snobbish.

387
00:37:27,447 --> 00:37:30,484
She hummed all the time.

388
00:37:32,519 --> 00:37:35,456
And Stephen Stills was
her favorite singer.

389
00:37:35,456 --> 00:37:37,491
Who?

390
00:37:38,492 --> 00:37:40,427
Never mind.

391
00:37:41,428 --> 00:37:43,464
What else?

392
00:37:43,464 --> 00:37:46,500
Considering the time...
she was actually...

393
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:52,473
pretty straight. I think
she only tried drugs once.

394
00:37:52,506 --> 00:37:55,542
There was a lifeguard
who gave her a hash brownie.

395
00:37:55,542 --> 00:37:57,444
She threw it up all over him.

396
00:38:00,514 --> 00:38:03,550
She laughed just like that.

397
00:38:05,586 --> 00:38:08,489
Words and poetry is what she loved.

398
00:38:09,523 --> 00:38:11,558
She was a "unique".

399
00:38:17,531 --> 00:38:19,433
Okay, you guys.

400
00:38:47,661 --> 00:38:49,563
How about a toast?

401
00:38:49,563 --> 00:38:51,498
Welcome to Charlotte.

402
00:38:51,598 --> 00:38:54,535
Welcome.

403
00:39:00,641 --> 00:39:04,578
Cheers! Thanks, you guys.

404
00:39:06,613 --> 00:39:11,552
You know, call me crazy... but I could
swear your friends like me more...

405
00:39:11,552 --> 00:39:14,488
than they like you.
- That's altogether possible.

406
00:39:14,621 --> 00:39:19,560
- My friends definitely like me more.
- What's your point?

407
00:39:19,593 --> 00:39:22,496
That I知 way out front
in the love race.

408
00:39:22,529 --> 00:39:26,567
- Love? Love is not a race.
- Our love is.

409
00:39:26,567 --> 00:39:30,504
- Our love?
- Yes, we're going for it, aren't we?

410
00:39:30,537 --> 00:39:32,539
Why not?

411
00:39:35,609 --> 00:39:39,546
- Alright, I have to tell you something.
- What?

412
00:39:41,582 --> 00:39:44,518
I never had a date for the benefit.

413
00:39:44,518 --> 00:39:46,520
- Really?
- Yeah.

414
00:39:46,553 --> 00:39:49,590
I was kind of wondering about that.

415
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:53,494
- I made that hat for myself?
- Yes.

416
00:39:53,627 --> 00:39:57,598
- You bought that dress for me?
- Yeah.

417
00:39:57,598 --> 00:40:02,569
You did all that so you could
get a hold of me and muss me up?

418
00:40:02,569 --> 00:40:04,571
Yes.

419
00:40:05,606 --> 00:40:10,544
First of all, you have great taste
because that dress was amazing.

420
00:40:10,577 --> 00:40:14,515
- Thank you.
- And second, you didn't have to lie.

421
00:40:14,615 --> 00:40:18,585
If you wanted to seduce me,
all you had to do was ask.

422
00:40:18,585 --> 00:40:21,555
That's not seducing,
that is asking.

423
00:40:21,622 --> 00:40:26,527
Besides - I don't know why - but women
seem to love it when you lie to them.

424
00:40:26,593 --> 00:40:30,597
There isn't a lie in the world
I'd rather hear than the truth.

425
00:40:30,597 --> 00:40:34,535
There she goes again, stepping out
on me and breaking my heart.

426
00:40:34,535 --> 00:40:36,570
Even he likes me more.

427
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:39,506
You're fired.

428
00:40:40,541 --> 00:40:43,577
- Come on, it's just...
- No! Ouch! Ouch!

429
00:40:54,621 --> 00:40:56,523
I can't believe this!

430
00:41:06,567 --> 00:41:08,602
Breathe, breathe.

431
00:41:10,637 --> 00:41:15,609
Breathe... are you alright?

432
00:41:21,582 --> 00:41:27,554
That's not accurate. Neuroblastoma is a
soft-tissue malignancy, but not a cancer.

433
00:41:28,589 --> 00:41:32,526
Most common in children.
Very rare in young adults.

434
00:41:32,626 --> 00:41:36,597
In Charlotte's case...
the tumor is in her chest cavity.

435
00:41:36,597 --> 00:41:40,534
It痴 growing rapidly, it's proved
resistant to both the radiation...

436
00:41:40,634 --> 00:41:44,605
and the chemotherapy.
- What about alternative therapies?

437
00:41:44,605 --> 00:41:46,507
Eastern medicine...?

438
00:41:49,576 --> 00:41:51,578
You don't hum this away.

439
00:41:53,614 --> 00:41:56,550
Charlotte is the expert in that area.

440
00:41:57,584 --> 00:42:01,622
Eventually, she'll be treated for pain.

441
00:42:01,622 --> 00:42:06,593
I suppose, as a final effort...
surgery could become on option.

442
00:42:06,593 --> 00:42:11,531
But it's risky. So risky that
Charlotte has...

443
00:42:11,664 --> 00:42:14,191
signed a directive forbidding it,
or any other form...

444
00:42:14,201 --> 00:42:17,638
of heroic intervention.

445
00:42:17,638 --> 00:42:19,573
All right.

446
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:29,450
Do you have any idea...
about time?

447
00:42:30,617 --> 00:42:35,522
A year. Maybe a year, at best.

448
00:42:44,631 --> 00:42:47,534
Real charmer, isn't she?

449
00:42:51,605 --> 00:42:55,542
How are you on
Cambodian money units?

450
00:43:01,648 --> 00:43:04,585
- Are you okay there?
- Yes, thank you.

451
00:43:41,688 --> 00:43:43,557
That's incredible.

452
00:43:43,624 --> 00:43:46,593
Doesn't it look exactly like
something she would have worn?

453
00:43:46,593 --> 00:43:48,529
Who?

454
00:43:48,695 --> 00:43:53,600
"Hope is a thing with feathers
That perches in the soul."

455
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:55,502
Woody Allen?

456
00:43:57,671 --> 00:44:03,544
Emily Dickinson! Only the greatest
poet ever! Uncultured swine.

457
00:44:03,644 --> 00:44:08,615
We all have our areas. I知 a food guy.
Why don't you ask me about food.

458
00:44:10,651 --> 00:44:15,589
Why are you the food guy?
What is it about the food?

459
00:44:15,589 --> 00:44:18,625
Food... food is the only...

460
00:44:18,659 --> 00:44:23,497
beautiful thing that truly nourishes.

461
00:44:24,631 --> 00:44:26,533
Is that a quote?

462
00:44:29,603 --> 00:44:31,505
That's me.

463
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:37,571
- Excuse me? Excuse me?
- Yes.

464
00:45:37,571 --> 00:45:40,474
The woman who just passed
by here and went in the door...?

465
00:45:40,607 --> 00:45:43,544
- Yes?
- It's not Lisa, is it?

466
00:45:43,610 --> 00:45:46,580
- Yes.
- Lisa Tyler?

467
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:47,648
Yes.

468
00:45:52,619 --> 00:45:54,588
Could you...?

469
00:45:56,690 --> 00:45:58,559
No. Thanks.

470
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:23,584
- Hello. Come in.
- Oh, you look so great.

471
00:46:23,584 --> 00:46:25,519
- Where are the girls?
- They're upstairs.

472
00:46:25,619 --> 00:46:27,521
I知 going to run up and say hi.

473
00:46:28,655 --> 00:46:30,591
You're a dog. Oh, man!

474
00:46:32,626 --> 00:46:34,528
There's stuff... in the kitchen.

475
00:46:36,028 --> 00:46:38,599
You want to give the candy to the
trick-or-treaters... when they come?

476
00:46:38,599 --> 00:46:41,535
One, two, three, go! Go!

477
00:46:42,536 --> 00:46:46,607
Ricky, don't laugh, or you're
going to get snot in the water.

478
00:46:46,607 --> 00:46:53,580
- Snot? Where is this snot in the water?
- Can I get you a bone or something?

479
00:46:55,616 --> 00:46:58,552
Don't bite anything
that's not an apple.

480
00:47:08,695 --> 00:47:10,631
Guess who?

481
00:47:13,667 --> 00:47:16,603
- It's Wonder Woman.
- No.

482
00:47:16,603 --> 00:47:19,640
- Get your hands out of there.
- I got it!

483
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:21,575
- We got the champ!
- Let me give you a hint.

484
00:47:21,675 --> 00:47:25,646
I was the best thing
that ever happened to you.

485
00:47:25,646 --> 00:47:29,516
- It couldn't be Lynn McHale.
- God! You are really bad!

486
00:47:29,583 --> 00:47:31,618
Lynn! I can't believe it!

487
00:47:31,618 --> 00:47:34,555
- Where are the kids?
- Upstairs in their room.

488
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:37,524
Keep bobbing for apples in there.

489
00:47:37,591 --> 00:47:41,595
- Just one more.
- Please...?

490
00:47:41,662 --> 00:47:44,598
But then you're going to have to promise
you're going to get in your jammies.

491
00:47:44,598 --> 00:47:46,600
- Yes.
- You promise?

492
00:47:49,670 --> 00:47:50,571
Which one?

493
00:47:51,572 --> 00:47:55,642
I know, "Butterflies".

494
00:47:56,643 --> 00:47:59,580
"Two butterflies... went out at noon..."

495
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:03,584
"And waltzed above a stream..."

496
00:48:03,650 --> 00:48:11,658
"Then stepped straight through the
firmament... and rested on a beam."

497
00:48:11,658 --> 00:48:18,599
"And then together bore away...
upon a shining...sea."

498
00:48:18,599 --> 00:48:23,570
"Though never yet, in any port...

499
00:48:23,637 --> 00:48:26,607
their coming mentioned me..."

500
00:48:28,709 --> 00:48:32,579
In my day, you bobbed for the apple...
may there's a nickel in it but...

501
00:48:32,646 --> 00:48:37,651
you eat the apple! Your little animals,
grab the coin and run for the door.

502
00:48:37,718 --> 00:48:41,622
- They're off to by crack.
- Definitely.

503
00:48:42,623 --> 00:48:46,560
- Where's my little puppy dog?
- I think he's upstairs.

504
00:49:20,694 --> 00:49:23,697
- There you are.
- Hi.

505
00:49:24,698 --> 00:49:27,634
We were just up on
the roof checking out...

506
00:49:27,634 --> 00:49:32,606
- The kids are sleeping.
- John's got this amazing set-up there.

507
00:49:32,706 --> 00:49:34,641
Lynn, I want you to meet Charlotte.

508
00:49:34,641 --> 00:49:39,713
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

509
00:49:50,657 --> 00:49:53,694
Something tells me
you're upset with me.

510
00:49:54,728 --> 00:49:56,630
What is it?

511
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:02,703
I was just wondering if...

512
00:50:04,738 --> 00:50:07,674
if you had sex with that woman?

513
00:50:09,710 --> 00:50:14,681
With Lynn?
Ever?

514
00:50:16,717 --> 00:50:21,688
- The answer to that is kind of obvious.
- She's an old girlfriend.

515
00:50:22,689 --> 00:50:25,626
- You knew that.
- I meant... tonight.

516
00:50:26,627 --> 00:50:30,697
- On the roof.
- You're not serious?

517
00:50:31,732 --> 00:50:37,671
You are serious. no!
No, of course not.

518
00:50:37,704 --> 00:50:41,642
First off, it's... it's not
exactly my style. Second...

519
00:50:41,642 --> 00:50:44,678
You have a girlfriend.

520
00:50:44,678 --> 00:50:46,713
Isn't that for me to say?

521
00:50:48,649 --> 00:50:54,721
As far as Lynn goes, why would I do
that? It doesn't make any sense.

522
00:50:54,721 --> 00:50:59,693
I know. I mean,
that's what I was thinking...

523
00:50:59,693 --> 00:51:06,667
we're... so happy...
What would be his reason?

524
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:11,638
I thought, God, if he did do it,
then you'd at least look... guilty.

525
00:51:11,772 --> 00:51:15,709
And you don't.
You look totally relaxed.

526
00:51:15,709 --> 00:51:18,745
You look more relaxed...
than before the party started.

527
00:51:18,745 --> 00:51:20,681
Well... there you go.

528
00:51:21,682 --> 00:51:23,717
But, you're a womanizer.

529
00:51:24,751 --> 00:51:26,720
You were a womanizer.

530
00:51:26,787 --> 00:51:32,693
- What is that exactly?
- Here we go.

531
00:51:32,759 --> 00:51:37,664
That's a guy who has sex with a lot of
women and is good at lying about it.

532
00:51:37,664 --> 00:51:44,638
Yes. But in this case I don't have
anything to lie about. Nothing happened!

533
00:51:49,710 --> 00:51:54,681
There's something about being sick...
in my heart.

534
00:51:56,784 --> 00:51:59,753
It痴 like I can feel every beat.

535
00:52:07,761 --> 00:52:10,697
I値l know if you're lying.

536
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:21,742
Oh, God!

537
00:52:23,677 --> 00:52:25,612
Oh, my God!

538
00:52:35,756 --> 00:52:39,693
- Can you pull over, please?
- Don't do this.

539
00:52:47,701 --> 00:52:53,674
- Charlotte! Charlotte!
- Why?

540
00:52:56,743 --> 00:53:01,715
Look, I never pretended to be...
what I知 not.

541
00:53:01,715 --> 00:53:03,717
- Why?!
- Why?!

542
00:53:03,717 --> 00:53:05,752
All right, fine, why? Why?

543
00:53:07,788 --> 00:53:10,724
Because I felt like it.

544
00:53:11,758 --> 00:53:14,795
Because nothing stopped me!

545
00:53:16,830 --> 00:53:18,732
What about love?

546
00:53:20,768 --> 00:53:24,671
Why do you have to be so juvenile?!
It was nothing.

547
00:53:24,705 --> 00:53:27,641
It was nothing! It meant nothing!

548
00:53:27,641 --> 00:53:30,644
If I could be different... I would.

549
00:53:30,711 --> 00:53:33,747
What about love?

550
00:53:40,754 --> 00:53:42,723
You know what?

551
00:53:43,791 --> 00:53:48,695
This was all wrong. This was a mistake,
right from the beginning.

552
00:53:48,729 --> 00:53:51,665
You're a kid... I知 a creep.

553
00:53:51,799 --> 00:53:55,736
You've got better things to do with
your last... with your time...

554
00:53:56,770 --> 00:54:00,641
than spend it with a man like me.

555
00:55:05,739 --> 00:55:09,676
Look who's here.
The Belle of Amherst.

556
00:55:23,690 --> 00:55:26,593
I've seen that face before.

557
00:55:26,727 --> 00:55:31,698
- You have?
- On several occasions.

558
00:55:32,699 --> 00:55:35,636
All for the same reason.

559
00:55:36,770 --> 00:55:40,707
You said Mom and Will
were just friends.

560
00:55:41,742 --> 00:55:47,714
They were friends.
But she was just nuts about him.

561
00:55:49,750 --> 00:55:51,752
She never slept with him.

562
00:55:52,786 --> 00:55:55,722
Maybe because she was
an old-fashioned girl.

563
00:55:56,723 --> 00:55:58,659
But she was smart.

564
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:03,730
Until she made the big mistake.
She told him how she really felt.

565
00:56:05,766 --> 00:56:08,669
It was up in Newport at the club.

566
00:56:08,802 --> 00:56:11,738
Labor Day weekend.
Big clam bake.

567
00:56:13,774 --> 00:56:15,676
Well, what happened?

568
00:56:15,809 --> 00:56:22,616
Next thing you knew, he was knocking
up Millie What's-her-name in a cabana.

569
00:56:22,749 --> 00:56:26,687
- Millie?
- Your mother's doubles partner.

570
00:56:28,755 --> 00:56:31,658
Why didn't you tell me any of this?

571
00:56:31,658 --> 00:56:37,731
- You know, you could have warned me.
- I could have. But I didn't.

572
00:56:37,731 --> 00:56:42,703
You never talk to me.
You never tell me what to do.

573
00:56:45,739 --> 00:56:48,675
Charlotte, take a good look at me.

574
00:56:50,711 --> 00:56:53,747
You want me to tell you what to do?

575
00:56:53,781 --> 00:56:58,719
Yes! You're my family!

576
00:56:59,753 --> 00:57:01,755
You're my family.

577
00:57:02,856 --> 00:57:06,727
You're supposed to take care of me.

578
00:57:22,743 --> 00:57:25,679
- Where you been?
- Home.

579
00:57:25,679 --> 00:57:28,715
- I called you ten times.
- I had the ringer off.

580
00:57:28,749 --> 00:57:32,686
- I don't get it.
- What's to get? I was hanging out.

581
00:57:33,687 --> 00:57:37,758
- Something happen at my party?
- You were there. We had a good time.

582
00:57:37,758 --> 00:57:39,660
- Come on! What's going on?
- Nothing!

583
00:57:39,693 --> 00:57:42,729
What is it, something with Charlotte?

584
00:57:43,730 --> 00:57:46,667
- We called it quits.
- You're shittin' me!

585
00:57:46,667 --> 00:57:50,737
It痴 not exactly we called it quits,
it was a more of, she called it quits.

586
00:57:51,738 --> 00:57:53,774
- What did you do?
- What do you mean...?

587
00:57:53,774 --> 00:57:55,709
- What did you do?
- What did l...?

588
00:57:55,709 --> 00:57:57,711
Don't bullshit me. What did you do?

589
00:57:57,711 --> 00:58:02,683
I had sex with Lynn McHale
up on your roof.

590
00:58:03,717 --> 00:58:05,719
You're kidding me.

591
00:58:09,790 --> 00:58:12,726
No, I知 not kidding you.

592
00:58:13,861 --> 00:58:16,697
Now she's gone. Totally.

593
00:58:18,832 --> 00:58:20,734
I知 really sorry you did that.

594
00:58:21,769 --> 00:58:23,771
I blew it.

595
00:58:24,805 --> 00:58:26,707
Can you get her back?

596
00:58:27,741 --> 00:58:30,778
- I blew it.
- So?

597
00:58:31,812 --> 00:58:35,749
So, I just go back to the way I was.

598
00:58:37,785 --> 00:58:39,787
And how are you going to do that?

599
00:58:44,758 --> 00:58:47,828
It was just going to get worse.

600
00:58:50,864 --> 00:58:53,801
The more attachment on both sides,
leading to what?

601
00:58:56,837 --> 00:58:59,773
It痴 now or later, right?

602
00:58:59,873 --> 00:59:03,844
I leave her a few months
from now, she...

603
00:59:03,844 --> 00:59:08,782
No, this is better.
This is much better.

604
00:59:15,889 --> 00:59:19,827
I wish the fuck I'd never met her.

605
00:59:21,862 --> 00:59:27,734
I hate to tell you, but there's
only two kinds of love stories.

606
00:59:27,734 --> 00:59:30,737
Boy loses girl.
Girl loses boy.

607
00:59:30,737 --> 00:59:33,774
That's it. Somebody
always gets left behind.

608
00:59:33,841 --> 00:59:38,745
Try and avoid that, you'll end up an
old man toasting yourself at Christmas.

609
00:59:38,745 --> 00:59:40,781
- Listen to me...
- I don't care!

610
00:59:40,848 --> 00:59:46,754
- you're going to die in your own arms!
- I don't care! I want it over with now!

611
01:00:52,853 --> 01:00:54,788
- Mr. Keane.
- Good night, Michael.

612
01:00:54,788 --> 01:00:59,760
You've got a visitor.
She's been waiting almost an hour.

613
01:01:16,877 --> 01:01:18,812
Lisa!

614
01:01:20,848 --> 01:01:28,856
- Sorry to disappoint you.
- No... you surprised me, that's all.

615
01:01:30,891 --> 01:01:32,793
Did you get my letter?

616
01:01:36,864 --> 01:01:39,800
What did you do with it, burn it?

617
01:01:41,835 --> 01:01:43,837
I read it.

618
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:56,817
- Do you want to come upstairs?
- No, thank you. I知 sorry.

619
01:01:56,817 --> 01:02:00,788
I didn't plan this.
I didn't plan to come.

620
01:02:00,888 --> 01:02:04,825
Peter, my husband
thought it was pointless.

621
01:02:06,860 --> 01:02:09,797
But, as it turns out,
I知 pregnant... just a few months.

622
01:02:09,930 --> 01:02:15,869
- Lisa! Congratulations! That's great.
- Thank you.

623
01:02:17,805 --> 01:02:20,841
Anyway, that made me want to meet you.

624
01:02:20,874 --> 01:02:25,779
I've been a little sentimental
about parenthood lately.

625
01:02:26,780 --> 01:02:32,753
- Do you consider me your parent?
- In a lousy absentee sort of way, yeah.

626
01:02:34,855 --> 01:02:40,761
- So, how... how is Millie? Your mother?
- She's great. She's good.

627
01:02:40,828 --> 01:02:46,867
Well, she's a nut. She went to Costa
Rica last summer with some guy.

628
01:02:46,867 --> 01:02:50,804
He owns a charter airline
and wears sunglasses indoors.

629
01:02:50,804 --> 01:02:53,874
I think he's a gun runner, but...

630
01:02:53,907 --> 01:02:58,812
- Do you really care?
- No. No.

631
01:02:59,847 --> 01:03:01,849
I guess not.

632
01:03:04,918 --> 01:03:09,757
What about you? How long
have you lived in the city?

633
01:03:09,923 --> 01:03:13,827
Just a few months.
We moved from Austin.

634
01:03:13,894 --> 01:03:18,899
If you hadn't been on that magazine...

635
01:03:19,933 --> 01:03:24,772
I might not have recognized you. I only
have one photograph and it's ancient.

636
01:03:24,772 --> 01:03:28,842
I have one picture of you, too.

637
01:03:30,844 --> 01:03:35,716
Just one. Your mother sent me one...
a long time ago.

638
01:03:35,816 --> 01:03:40,788
You must have been about twelve.

639
01:03:41,922 --> 01:03:43,824
You had a horse.

640
01:03:45,859 --> 01:03:49,797
Summer camp. My teeth are
bigger than the horse's.

641
01:03:49,797 --> 01:03:55,769
- I hated that picture. I hate it.
- I don't. You were very beautiful.

642
01:03:57,838 --> 01:04:00,874
And you haven't changed a bit.

643
01:04:17,891 --> 01:04:20,928
- I should go.
- Why?

644
01:04:23,764 --> 01:04:28,802
I really just wanted to meet you.
And maybe...

645
01:04:30,871 --> 01:04:33,740
- I don't know.
- What? Tell me.

646
01:04:33,807 --> 01:04:38,812
It痴 not big deal. I've always had a
fantasy that you were looking for me.

647
01:04:38,879 --> 01:04:42,783
And all you really wanted was
to say that you were sorry.

648
01:04:55,863 --> 01:04:57,798
Lisa, I am.

649
01:05:11,945 --> 01:05:15,816
Hey, can l... Can I call you?

650
01:06:38,866 --> 01:06:40,768
How did you get in here?

651
01:06:43,837 --> 01:06:45,839
Dolly.

652
01:06:47,875 --> 01:06:50,744
Would you mind leaving now, please?

653
01:06:54,882 --> 01:06:56,917
I need to talk to you.

654
01:06:57,818 --> 01:07:00,854
I think you've wasted
enough of my time.

655
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:11,799
What I did was... very wrong.

656
01:07:17,905 --> 01:07:19,807
And stupid.

657
01:07:23,811 --> 01:07:26,847
I have no excuses...

658
01:07:31,819 --> 01:07:34,888
I did what I did because...

659
01:07:34,888 --> 01:07:39,827
- I was scared.
- You were a coward!

660
01:07:47,868 --> 01:07:49,870
Can you forgive me?

661
01:07:49,870 --> 01:07:53,841
You betrayed me! For what?
Because you got the shakes?

662
01:07:53,841 --> 01:07:58,812
- I was scared.
- You don't think I知 scared?!

663
01:07:58,912 --> 01:08:02,850
You don't think I知 hanging onto
my courage by my fingernails!

664
01:08:02,850 --> 01:08:07,821
Don't touch me! Get away from me!
Get out of here!

665
01:08:09,890 --> 01:08:12,893
Just go!

666
01:08:13,961 --> 01:08:16,830
You're not good enough.

667
01:08:16,830 --> 01:08:20,901
I know... I know I知 not.

668
01:08:24,872 --> 01:08:26,874
I just...

669
01:08:31,945 --> 01:08:34,882
Can you let me love you?

670
01:08:38,952 --> 01:08:40,854
Please.

671
01:08:42,890 --> 01:08:44,925
Please. Please...

672
01:08:45,959 --> 01:08:47,961
Please let me try again.

673
01:08:48,996 --> 01:08:51,932
I知 so tired.

674
01:11:13,974 --> 01:11:19,880
"The stars are as soft
as flowers and as near."

675
01:11:19,980 --> 01:11:24,387
"The hills are webs of shadow..."

676
01:11:24,388 --> 01:11:27,059
"...slowly spun."

677
01:11:27,259 --> 01:11:35,896
"No separate leaf or single blade.
All blend to one."

678
01:12:21,942 --> 01:12:23,844
I love you.

679
01:12:41,995 --> 01:12:44,932
We did it... that was great.

680
01:12:44,932 --> 01:12:47,968
- Bye!
- Bye!

681
01:12:51,939 --> 01:12:53,974
Are you jealous?

682
01:12:54,975 --> 01:12:58,946
- You think...? I am not jealous!
- Yes you are!

683
01:12:59,046 --> 01:13:04,918
Do I look jealous? I am not jealous.
I知 a little jealous.

684
01:13:06,954 --> 01:13:11,959
- Wait, check me out.
- Excellent! Go! Go! Go!

685
01:13:12,025 --> 01:13:15,929
Judges give it a ten!
A perfect ten!

686
01:13:16,964 --> 01:13:18,999
Charlotte!

687
01:13:27,975 --> 01:13:29,910
Doctor!

688
01:13:29,910 --> 01:13:31,912
- Mr. Keane...
- Tell me.

689
01:13:31,912 --> 01:13:35,883
The repeat MRI and CAT scan
show interval progression.

690
01:13:35,983 --> 01:13:37,951
- The tumor's grown.
- Yes.

691
01:13:37,951 --> 01:13:42,856
Considerably. It痴 begun to obstruct
the outflow from her heart.

692
01:13:43,023 --> 01:13:46,927
I知 sorry, I wish there was...

693
01:13:46,994 --> 01:13:51,899
There's very little we can do.
We may be talking about weeks.

694
01:13:51,999 --> 01:13:53,934
- Weeks?
- I知 sorry.

695
01:13:54,001 --> 01:13:56,970
- You said she had a year!
- No, I said a year at best.

696
01:13:56,970 --> 01:13:59,006
That's not good enough!
You said a year!

697
01:13:59,006 --> 01:14:02,943
- I want to have a year!
- This is inappropriate.

698
01:14:02,943 --> 01:14:06,013
Alright, sorry, sorry.

699
01:14:09,049 --> 01:14:10,951
You said there would be
a point when surgery...

700
01:14:10,951 --> 01:14:15,022
- might be an option.
- lf Charlotte agrees to it.

701
01:14:15,022 --> 01:14:18,959
Let's assume that she did. When
would this operation take place?

702
01:14:18,959 --> 01:14:22,029
When it's clear we're losing her.

703
01:14:24,965 --> 01:14:28,902
- Would you perform it?
- I am not a surgeon.

704
01:14:28,902 --> 01:14:32,940
The point is not finding someone
who's qualified.

705
01:14:32,973 --> 01:14:36,910
It痴 finding someone who's qualified
who is willing to do the operation.

706
01:15:05,005 --> 01:15:06,907
- Hey!
- Hey.

707
01:15:08,041 --> 01:15:09,977
- How are you? You okay?
- Yes.

708
01:15:09,977 --> 01:15:14,014
- How do you feel?
- Stoned.

709
01:15:15,048 --> 01:15:17,951
You're killing my hand.

710
01:15:20,020 --> 01:15:25,926
Charlotte, there's something I would
like to talk to you about.

711
01:15:26,994 --> 01:15:28,862
Don't. Heavy. No heavy.

712
01:15:28,929 --> 01:15:32,933
Sibley and I have been talking...
about surgery.

713
01:15:34,001 --> 01:15:36,870
About the paper you signed.

714
01:15:36,937 --> 01:15:40,941
No violins. Come on.

715
01:15:42,009 --> 01:15:43,977
I知 fine.

716
01:15:43,977 --> 01:15:46,914
Woody, you're the head of surgery...

717
01:15:46,980 --> 01:15:50,017
if you can't help me, who can?

718
01:15:50,017 --> 01:15:54,922
Are you trying to tell me that in all
of Mt. Sinai, there is not one single...

719
01:15:55,089 --> 01:15:58,992
Yeah, Sibley told me that.

720
01:16:00,060 --> 01:16:02,930
The 30th. Yeah, fine... blank.

721
01:16:03,931 --> 01:16:08,001
Ok, when will the doctor be out
of surgery?

722
01:16:08,068 --> 01:16:12,973
This is urgent. I have a friend
who says she's one of the few doc...

723
01:16:12,973 --> 01:16:16,009
I知 sorry. Thank you.

724
01:16:17,978 --> 01:16:20,981
Please, I don't... speak German.

725
01:16:20,981 --> 01:16:23,917
Please, I'd like to speak to a doctor.

726
01:16:27,955 --> 01:16:29,890
Where's the doctor?

727
01:16:31,925 --> 01:16:36,897
He can't be in surgery for a week
and a half. No! You do not hang up!...

728
01:17:31,051 --> 01:17:33,954
She doesn't have long.

729
01:17:33,987 --> 01:17:38,926
- Weeks. Maybe less.
- And they can't do anything for her?

730
01:17:38,926 --> 01:17:43,897
No, her doctor says when
it's hopeless at the end...

731
01:17:44,932 --> 01:17:49,970
...surgery could be an option.
Heroic surgery, she calls it.

732
01:17:50,003 --> 01:17:54,942
That's why I知 out looking for someone
to make sure that when the times...

733
01:17:54,942 --> 01:17:59,980
comes, it's a hero that performs it.
I haven't found anybody yet though.

734
01:18:00,013 --> 01:18:03,917
I can't find anybody who's even
willing to attempt it. I will!

735
01:18:03,984 --> 01:18:07,988
I知 going to find someone
because I can't lose her.

736
01:18:08,021 --> 01:18:11,925
It won't happen.
She's too young.

737
01:18:23,036 --> 01:18:27,941
I知 sorry. I知 here,
but I have no right to be here.

738
01:18:36,016 --> 01:18:40,020
There's no excuse for
what I did to you, Lisa.

739
01:18:41,088 --> 01:18:44,024
You're my child.

740
01:18:45,058 --> 01:18:47,061
You needed me.

741
01:18:56,103 --> 01:18:58,005
I知 so sorry.

742
01:19:04,111 --> 01:19:09,016
I want to help you... find a surgeon.

743
01:19:09,083 --> 01:19:15,055
I知 a researcher. I can find anyone.
Even you.

744
01:19:20,127 --> 01:19:22,029
What do you want for Christmas?

745
01:19:22,162 --> 01:19:26,033
You can be really selfish
about this... anything you want.

746
01:19:28,068 --> 01:19:31,004
Or we can go somewhere... anywhere.

747
01:19:31,004 --> 01:19:34,975
I値l take you to Bali...
Timbuktu... Buffalo.

748
01:19:35,075 --> 01:19:38,011
Don't you have a restaurant to run?

749
01:19:41,048 --> 01:19:44,985
What's more important,
is what do you want for Christmas?

750
01:19:45,018 --> 01:19:47,020
No, you already gave me my present.

751
01:19:47,020 --> 01:19:49,056
I forgot. Did you like it?

752
01:19:51,091 --> 01:19:52,993
What was it again?

753
01:19:52,993 --> 01:19:57,064
Misery, heartbreak, pain...

754
01:19:57,064 --> 01:20:00,000
...happiness, love...

755
01:20:00,167 --> 01:20:05,072
- life.
- I remember now.

756
01:20:06,106 --> 01:20:09,009
What can I give you?

757
01:20:09,143 --> 01:20:12,079
More of this.

758
01:20:39,039 --> 01:20:42,076
- Yeah?
- I've got him.

759
01:20:42,076 --> 01:20:45,012
Oh Lisa, hold on, hold on.

760
01:20:45,012 --> 01:20:48,048
- Yeah, go ahead.
- His name is Tom Grandy.

761
01:20:48,048 --> 01:20:52,019
Harvard undergrad. He's at
the Cleveland Heart Institute.

762
01:20:52,019 --> 01:20:56,056
- Ohio?!
- It's one of the best in the world.

763
01:20:56,090 --> 01:21:01,028
He did his residency at Brigham,
cardiac surgery training at Cleveland.

764
01:21:01,028 --> 01:21:05,099
He takes the cases no one else will
touch. They say he's a miracle worker.

765
01:21:05,099 --> 01:21:09,036
He spends a lot of time traveling,
a lot of time lecturing.

766
01:21:09,169 --> 01:21:14,007
I got you an appointment today at 12:30.
Do not be late. He only has 15 minutes.

767
01:21:14,108 --> 01:21:18,078
The surgeon that recommended him said
if you can get him to take the case...

768
01:21:18,078 --> 01:21:22,015
...you know Charlotte's got a chance.
He hates the fail.

769
01:21:33,060 --> 01:21:35,028
- Mr. Keane?
- Yeah, hi.

770
01:21:35,095 --> 01:21:38,999
Thanks for a seeing me. I've got
everything that you asked for.

771
01:21:39,066 --> 01:21:43,070
Just once I'd like
to get sent something simple.

772
01:21:44,071 --> 01:21:49,042
That never happens anymore.
The downside of being good at my job.

773
01:21:49,042 --> 01:21:55,015
Good? My daughter was told
you were the best.

774
01:21:56,049 --> 01:22:00,087
Like most people,
I do the best can.

775
01:22:02,523 --> 01:22:06,074
Last time she passed out she regained
consciousness almost immediately.

776
01:22:06,094 --> 01:22:10,031
Next time, or the time after, she won't.
When that happens, call me.

777
01:22:11,098 --> 01:22:13,067
Room 17 is ready, Dr. Grandy.

778
01:22:13,133 --> 01:22:17,137
They'll reach me wherever I am.
I値l coordinate with Sibley.

779
01:22:17,137 --> 01:22:21,075
- I can't thank you enough. Thank you.
- I haven't done anything yet.

780
01:22:23,110 --> 01:22:25,012
I知 home.

781
01:22:26,046 --> 01:22:28,082
Hello.

782
01:22:32,119 --> 01:22:34,054
There you are.

783
01:22:35,055 --> 01:22:39,026
- Where were you today?
- What do you mean?

784
01:22:40,127 --> 01:22:43,063
When you called,
I thought you were at work...

785
01:22:43,063 --> 01:22:45,999
then when I called you back, John
said you hadn't been in all day.

786
01:22:46,133 --> 01:22:50,070
I was in Montclair, New Jersey.

787
01:22:50,070 --> 01:22:53,107
- Why?
- An opportunity.

788
01:22:53,107 --> 01:22:56,043
Do you mean sexual or professional?

789
01:22:57,077 --> 01:22:59,079
Sexual.

790
01:22:59,079 --> 01:23:01,115
I mean, professional!

791
01:23:53,133 --> 01:23:57,037
You get it in there without breaking
it, I値l give you another 5 bucks.

792
01:23:57,071 --> 01:24:00,140
Six dollars... six of you.

793
01:24:00,140 --> 01:24:04,078
It痴 way too crowded.
I知 way too claustrophobic.

794
01:24:04,078 --> 01:24:08,148
- I値l take the next one.
- You sure? Okay... bye. Help.

795
01:24:12,186 --> 01:24:16,090
- You're going away for the holidays?
- I doubt it.

796
01:24:16,156 --> 01:24:19,193
- Did Mr. Keane enjoy his trip?
- What trip?

797
01:24:19,193 --> 01:24:22,963
- Just yesterday.
- I wouldn't call that a trip.

798
01:24:23,097 --> 01:24:29,069
I've never been to Ohio. It痴 amazing
how little I've seen of this country.

799
01:24:31,105 --> 01:24:35,042
Cool... I知 gonna
get me some hot chocolate...

800
01:24:44,051 --> 01:24:47,121
- Is it straight?
- Not straight.

801
01:24:48,122 --> 01:24:51,058
What were you doing in Ohio?

802
01:24:52,126 --> 01:24:56,029
I had a meeting with heart specialist.
He's willing to operate.

803
01:24:58,165 --> 01:25:02,102
That's exactly what
I didn't want you to do.

804
01:25:02,102 --> 01:25:05,038
You went behind my back.
You lied to me.

805
01:25:05,172 --> 01:25:08,108
- This what we talked about...
- Cut it out! Stop!

806
01:25:08,108 --> 01:25:10,110
No, we talked about that!

807
01:25:10,110 --> 01:25:13,046
You do not want to die!
You want to live!

808
01:25:13,180 --> 01:25:17,117
You think I haven't
been through this? So many times!

809
01:25:17,117 --> 01:25:21,088
I don't want to give people hope
when there isn't any.

810
01:25:21,188 --> 01:25:23,991
Why not? Maybe, we need hope.

811
01:25:24,124 --> 01:25:28,062
Maybe, I need to know that I've
done everything that I could do.

812
01:25:28,062 --> 01:25:29,997
lf I知 gonna...

813
01:26:34,061 --> 01:26:39,066
What would I do, Will
if you weren't here?

814
01:26:41,101 --> 01:26:45,072
Where would I be? Seriously?

815
01:26:47,141 --> 01:26:50,010
You'll never have
to worry about that.

816
01:26:55,149 --> 01:26:58,085
I値l do whatever I have to do.

817
01:26:59,119 --> 01:27:05,025
I値l tear up the papers. I値l tell
the doctors. Whatever you want.

818
01:27:10,164 --> 01:27:13,033
Cause I really want...

819
01:27:15,135 --> 01:27:18,105
I don't want to leave you.

820
01:27:20,207 --> 01:27:21,041
You know?

821
01:27:23,077 --> 01:27:26,013
No. No, no, no.

822
01:27:39,093 --> 01:27:42,029
- This is really good.
- What?

823
01:27:46,100 --> 01:27:50,037
- This is much better than mine.
- No, you didn't!

824
01:27:50,137 --> 01:27:52,072
- Yeah, I did.
- Oh, God!

825
01:27:52,072 --> 01:27:55,109
- Forgeries!
- Yeah, a lot of them.

826
01:27:55,109 --> 01:27:58,045
Mine...yours...

827
01:28:19,133 --> 01:28:21,068
Will?

828
01:28:27,141 --> 01:28:29,076
Will?

829
01:28:31,211 --> 01:28:35,149
- What are you doing in there?
- Nothing.

830
01:28:42,156 --> 01:28:46,093
Hey, no, no! Go back!
Give me another minute, alright?

831
01:29:06,180 --> 01:29:11,151
- No, you're going to tire yourself out.
- This I've got to see!

832
01:29:11,251 --> 01:29:14,188
- Go back! Back!
- I can't believe it.

833
01:29:14,188 --> 01:29:17,124
Oh, my God!

834
01:29:19,259 --> 01:29:21,195
Alright. Almost.

835
01:29:21,195 --> 01:29:24,064
Hold on, hold on.

836
01:29:24,131 --> 01:29:29,136
Finishing up. Hold on now.
Just a second.

837
01:29:31,138 --> 01:29:36,143
Here we are. Okay! Alright.
Surprise!

838
01:30:01,235 --> 01:30:03,170
It痴 New York.

839
01:30:03,170 --> 01:30:05,139
This is Grandy.

840
01:31:39,233 --> 01:31:42,136
- You won't have long.
- All right.

841
01:32:18,238 --> 01:32:25,179
"Time cannot break...
the bird's wing from the bird."

842
01:32:25,245 --> 01:32:32,086
"The bird and wing together...
go down, one feather."

843
01:32:36,190 --> 01:32:39,193
"No thing that ever flew..."

844
01:32:39,226 --> 01:32:43,130
"...not the lark, not you..."

845
01:32:46,166 --> 01:32:50,237
"Can die as others do."

846
01:32:54,174 --> 01:32:57,211
What have I done to you?

847
01:33:00,214 --> 01:33:03,217
You ruined me for other women.

848
01:33:04,284 --> 01:33:07,221
I saved you for them.

849
01:33:11,258 --> 01:33:14,261
Is she type 創' cross 6 for units?
What're we waiting for?

850
01:33:14,261 --> 01:33:16,163
- Just you, Doctor.
- Let's move!

851
01:38:42,322 --> 01:38:45,259
- I don't believe it.
- What?

852
01:38:45,522 --> 01:38:47,859
I'm here with my father and my son.
