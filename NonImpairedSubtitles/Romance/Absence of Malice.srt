He got dead before you got here.

Why would they be interested
in a guy that's been dead that long?

on Michael Gallagher.

For those of you who are new,

his old man, Big Tommy,
handled five states' worth of liquor

30
00:05:20,195 --> 00:05:23,155
and kept the longshoremen
out of Miami for 15 years.

31

He played rough.

32
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:27,827
If he'd been alive when Diaz got hit,
he'd have been Suspect 1.

33
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:29,912
Since he was dead,
he's not involved.

34
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,747
Big Tommy had a stroke in '67,

35
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:35,167
brought Mike down from Chicago
to run the family store.

The question is not whether
your story is true,

the question is: What protection
do we have if it proves to be false?

of the United States
Department of Justice.
With me here are...

1182
01:33:52,585 --> 01:33:55,838
Hell, Angie, you know
who these folks are,
just write them in.

1183
01:33:56,006 --> 01:33:58,215
I've had no conversation
with anyone here

1184
01:33:58,383 --> 01:34:00,592
prior to the beginning
of this record.

1185
01:34:00,760 --> 01:34:04,430
I'd like to inform all present
they have the right to remain silent

1186
01:34:04,597 --> 01:34:06,515
and the right to retain counsel.

1187
01:34:06,683 --> 01:34:11,395
I inform them further that
anything they say during
the course of this... Uh... Uh...

1188
01:34:12,188 --> 01:34:13,355
What the hell is this?

1189
01:34:13,523 --> 01:34:17,318
- This inquiry may be taken down
and used against them.

1190
01:34:17,485 --> 01:34:19,069
Anybody here
want a lawyer?

1191
01:34:19,237 --> 01:34:21,238
No.
No.

1192
01:34:21,406 --> 01:34:24,408
Ms. Carter,
you brought your own.

1193
01:34:24,576 --> 01:34:27,077
Mr. Gallagher,
do you want a lawyer, sir?

1194
01:34:27,245 --> 01:34:28,412
No.
WELLS: Good.

1195
01:34:28,580 --> 01:34:31,749
No more room in here anyway.
Anybody wanna read the paper?

1196
01:34:35,086 --> 01:34:38,756
You got a story in here that says,
"Strike force investigating a DA,

1197
01:34:38,923 --> 01:34:40,090
suspecting bribes."

1198
01:34:42,761 --> 01:34:44,887
It's the damnedest story
you ever read.

1199
01:34:45,055 --> 01:34:47,848
Nobody in this department
ever read a story like that.

1200
01:34:48,558 --> 01:34:50,100
Tell you what we're gonna do.

1201
01:34:50,268 --> 01:34:52,895
We're gonna sit right here
and talk about it.

1202
01:34:53,688 --> 01:34:57,316
Now, if you get tired of talking here,
Mr. Marshall Elving Patrick

1203
01:34:57,484 --> 01:35:00,277
will hand you
one of them subpoenas he's got

1204
01:35:00,445 --> 01:35:02,946
and we'll go talk
in front of the grand jury.

1205
01:35:03,114 --> 01:35:05,574
We'll talk all day if you want to.

1206
01:35:07,452 --> 01:35:11,705
But come sundown, there's gonna be
two things true that ain't true now.

1207
01:35:12,916 --> 01:35:15,709
One is that the United States
Department of Justice

1208
01:35:15,877 --> 01:35:18,253
is gonna know
what in the good Christ...

1209
01:35:18,421 --> 01:35:21,465
Excuse me, Angie.
- Is going on around here.

1210
01:35:23,385 --> 01:35:27,471
And the other is I'm gonna have
somebody's ass in my briefcase.

1211
01:35:28,807 --> 01:35:30,391
Elliott?

1212
01:35:32,936 --> 01:35:34,395
Jim?

1213
01:35:35,605 --> 01:35:39,983
Fine. All right, Elving,
hand whichever of these fellas
you like a subpoena.

1214
01:35:40,151 --> 01:35:42,486
We'll go and talk
in front of the grand jury.

1215
01:35:42,654 --> 01:35:46,156
Gallagher's a government witness.
A wonderful thing, subpoena.

1216
01:35:46,324 --> 01:35:48,617
He's working on Diaz,
reporting to me.

1217
01:35:48,785 --> 01:35:51,578
Your arrangements include
campaign contributions?

1218
01:35:51,746 --> 01:35:54,790
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about $9000.

1219
01:35:54,958 --> 01:35:57,835
Cashier's checks. It's all in the file.
What file?

1220
01:35:58,002 --> 01:36:00,712
This file.
Rosen's investigation file.

1221
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:03,590
You can't have an investigation
without a file, Jim.

1222
01:36:03,758 --> 01:36:05,634
Let me see.
I'll save you looking.

1223
01:36:05,802 --> 01:36:09,012
It says you met with Gallagher
and didn't report it.

1224
01:36:09,180 --> 01:36:13,058
It says Gallagher gave money to
some committee thinks you're pretty.

1225
01:36:14,185 --> 01:36:16,270
I got phone taps, not legal,
mind you.

1226
01:36:16,438 --> 01:36:19,940
I got phone taps of you talking
on Gallagher's answering machine.

1227
01:36:20,483 --> 01:36:21,859
You son of a bitch.

1228
01:36:22,026 --> 01:36:24,278
WELLS:
He don't think much
of your investigation.

1229
01:36:24,737 --> 01:36:27,364
Jim, why didn't you report
that meeting?

1230
01:36:28,241 --> 01:36:30,659
That was Gallagher.
Those were his rules.

1231
01:36:30,827 --> 01:36:33,036
He said he wanted
to deal only with me.

1232
01:36:33,496 --> 01:36:35,789
We had had a leak.
WELLS: You'd had a leak?

1233
01:36:35,957 --> 01:36:39,710
You call what's going on
around here a leak?

1234
01:36:40,462 --> 01:36:44,339
Boy, the last time
there was a leak like this,
Noah built himself a boat.

1235
01:36:44,507 --> 01:36:48,177
But look, I don't know anything
about any cashier's checks.

1236
01:36:48,344 --> 01:36:52,598
Now, Gallagher said that he would
listen for us if we quit hassling him.

1237
01:36:52,765 --> 01:36:54,975
He wanted a public statement.
He got it.

1238
01:36:59,022 --> 01:37:03,233
Robert, where'd you get
the authority to run those taps?

1239
01:37:04,194 --> 01:37:06,236
No place. I just did it.

1240
01:37:06,404 --> 01:37:09,823
You wanna tell me why you'd go
and do a fool thing like that?

1241
01:37:09,991 --> 01:37:14,912
You see, we had reason to believe...
He was acting on my instructions.

1242
01:37:15,079 --> 01:37:17,498
WELLS:
He don't get paid
to act on your instructions.

1243
01:37:17,665 --> 01:37:21,043
He gets paid to abide by
and to enforce the law.

1244
01:37:23,338 --> 01:37:28,509
Elliott, how come
you're investigating the DA
without telling the department?

1245
01:37:28,676 --> 01:37:31,094
It was preliminary.
We had cause but no case.

1246
01:37:31,262 --> 01:37:34,223
Do you think you have
a case now?

1247
01:37:34,390 --> 01:37:36,099
Think so.
Make it.

1248
01:37:37,769 --> 01:37:39,770
Here? In front of them?

1249
01:37:39,938 --> 01:37:43,106
WELLS:
Do you know something
that ain't all over the newspapers?

1250
01:37:43,274 --> 01:37:47,110
Go ahead and make your case.
It'll be good practice for you.

1251
01:38:00,375 --> 01:38:04,127
Mr. Gallagher, you know Mr. Quinn?
Yeah.

1252
01:38:04,546 --> 01:38:05,754
ROSEN:
How do you know him?

1253
01:38:05,922 --> 01:38:10,133
He asked me if I would help him
find out what happened to Joey Diaz.

1254
01:38:12,804 --> 01:38:16,640
I show you photostats
of two cashier's checks

1255
01:38:16,808 --> 01:38:18,976
drawn on
the Flagship National Bank,

1256
01:38:19,143 --> 01:38:21,979
made payable to the
Committee for a Better Miami.

1257
01:38:22,647 --> 01:38:24,898
Have you seen them before?

1258
01:38:25,400 --> 01:38:27,401
Yeah, they're mine.

1259
01:38:28,945 --> 01:38:31,822
For what purpose
did you make these checks?

1260
01:38:32,657 --> 01:38:34,992
To contribute
to the committee.

1261
01:38:35,827 --> 01:38:38,620
Well, why was that?
Because they do good work.

1262
01:38:40,957 --> 01:38:45,419
You aware the committee
is interested in the political
career of Mr. Quinn?

1263
01:38:45,587 --> 01:38:47,671
So?
That's okay with me.

1264
01:38:57,890 --> 01:39:00,392
Let me point out
that these checks were drawn

1265
01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:04,646
immediately before
and immediately after
your meeting with Mr. Quinn.

1266
01:39:04,814 --> 01:39:06,148
What do you make of that?

1267
01:39:06,316 --> 01:39:08,483
What do you make of it?
Come on, now.

1268
01:39:08,651 --> 01:39:12,070
You're trying to say
that you just got
an urge to contribute

1269
01:39:12,238 --> 01:39:16,033
to his committee
before you met him, then
you got another urge after?

1270
01:39:16,200 --> 01:39:19,328
Yeah. I came into
some extra money
a couple days later.

1271
01:39:19,495 --> 01:39:23,457
All right.
You made these contributions
anonymously. Why?

1272
01:39:23,875 --> 01:39:27,294
I wanted them to be anonymous.
ROSEN: I'll bet. Tell us why.

1273
01:39:27,462 --> 01:39:30,213
I didn't want other people
asking for contributions.

1274
01:39:30,381 --> 01:39:33,634
The reason is
that you were paying off.

1275
01:39:33,801 --> 01:39:35,302
Prove it.

1276
01:39:39,599 --> 01:39:41,391
Mr. Gallagher,

1277
01:39:41,559 --> 01:39:45,812
if you in fact told Mr. Quinn
that you would act as
a government informant...

1278
01:39:45,980 --> 01:39:49,733
No, wait a minute.
I said that I'd see
what I could find out.

1279
01:39:49,901 --> 01:39:52,486
ROSEN: What are you finding out?
Nothing.

1280
01:39:52,654 --> 01:39:54,237
Nobody wants to talk about it.

1281
01:39:54,405 --> 01:39:57,115
You son of a bitch.
You're trying to frame me.

1282
01:39:57,283 --> 01:40:00,202
He set me up.
He arranged the meetings.

1283
01:40:00,370 --> 01:40:02,663
He is the one who got me
on his machine.

1284
01:40:02,830 --> 01:40:05,707
He's got the cancelled checks.
He's trying to frame me!

1285
01:40:05,875 --> 01:40:08,377
What's his motive?
To get even, you dummy!

1286
01:40:10,296 --> 01:40:11,922
You guys ought to get married.

1287
01:40:19,597 --> 01:40:21,682
Mr. Gallagher, are you that smart?

1288
01:40:22,308 --> 01:40:24,267
QUINN:
You're damn right he is.

1289
01:40:32,443 --> 01:40:34,152
Ms. Carter,

1290
01:40:35,071 --> 01:40:37,572
you seem to know a lot
about what's going on.

1291
01:40:37,740 --> 01:40:40,325
I'd like to ask you
where these stories came from.

1292
01:40:40,493 --> 01:40:42,077
Objection.
My client is not...

1293
01:40:42,245 --> 01:40:45,539
You save your objections, counselor.
This ain't a courtroom.

1294
01:40:48,084 --> 01:40:51,712
Now, Ms. Carter, this story
about Mr. Gallagher, the first one.

1295
01:40:52,964 --> 01:40:56,800
I had reason to believe
the strike force was
investigating Mr. Gallagher.

1296
01:40:56,968 --> 01:40:59,928
I confirmed it. I wrote the story.
WELLS: How did you confirm?

1297
01:41:00,096 --> 01:41:03,306
Objection. You are asking...
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1298
01:41:05,435 --> 01:41:07,602
I wanna answer this.

1299
01:41:08,521 --> 01:41:10,647
I read the file.
WELLS: Did you, now?

1300
01:41:12,316 --> 01:41:14,443
How did you come
to read the file?

1301
01:41:17,196 --> 01:41:20,073
I was talking with Mr. Rosen.
It was lying on his desk.

1302
01:41:20,241 --> 01:41:22,117
When he left his office,
I read it.

1303
01:41:22,744 --> 01:41:26,079
Did you ask Mr. Rosen what
in the name of Christ he was doing

1304
01:41:26,247 --> 01:41:28,999
leaving the file on his desk
for you to read it?

1305
01:41:29,167 --> 01:41:31,793
He intended me to read it.
WELLS: Why would that be?

1306
01:41:32,962 --> 01:41:36,006
So I would write a story
that made Mr. Gallagher look bad.

1307
01:41:40,511 --> 01:41:42,345
This story.

1308
01:41:43,264 --> 01:41:45,182
Did Mr. Rosen give you
that one too?

1309
01:41:49,353 --> 01:41:50,854
No.

1310
01:41:52,190 --> 01:41:53,523
Go ahead, Ms. Carter.

1311
01:41:55,193 --> 01:41:56,985
I'm sorry, I can't tell you.

1312
01:42:00,573 --> 01:42:03,700
I think I know
where we're headed here.

1313
01:42:04,702 --> 01:42:07,704
Before we get there,
I wanna say something to you.

1314
01:42:08,581 --> 01:42:13,710
You know and I know
that we can't tell you
what to print or what not to.

1315
01:42:13,878 --> 01:42:16,463
We hope people in the press
will act responsibly.

1316
01:42:16,631 --> 01:42:19,674
When you don't, there ain't a lot
anybody can do about it.

1317
01:42:19,842 --> 01:42:24,513
But we can't have people go around
leaking stuff for their own reasons.

1318
01:42:24,680 --> 01:42:26,389
It ain't legal.

1319
01:42:26,557 --> 01:42:29,518
And worse than that,
by God, it ain't right.

1320
01:42:30,019 --> 01:42:32,521
I can't stop you,
but I can damn well stop them.

1321
01:42:32,688 --> 01:42:34,815
I wanna know
where them stories come from.

1322
01:42:34,982 --> 01:42:38,401
Under the First Amendment,
my client is not required to reveal...

1323
01:42:38,569 --> 01:42:39,986
That's all horsepucky.

1324
01:42:40,154 --> 01:42:43,865
The First Amendment don't say that,
and the privilege don't exist.

1325
01:42:44,033 --> 01:42:46,952
Now, do you understand
I can ask you these questions

1326
01:42:47,119 --> 01:42:49,704
in front of a grand jury?
Yes.

1327
01:42:49,872 --> 01:42:52,958
And if you don't answer,
you can go to jail?

1328
01:42:54,168 --> 01:42:55,710
I know it's possible, yes.

1329
01:42:55,878 --> 01:42:59,256
Oh, it's more than possible,
Ms. Carter, it's damned likely.

1330
01:43:00,132 --> 01:43:02,384
I ain't anxious
to be locking up reporters.

1331
01:43:02,552 --> 01:43:05,887
But I'm gonna tell you something.
I don't like what's going on.

1332
01:43:06,055 --> 01:43:09,099
May I say something, please?
Yes.

1333
01:43:10,476 --> 01:43:12,727
I don't wanna go to jail,

1334
01:43:13,688 --> 01:43:17,107
but this has got to stop
someplace.

1335
01:43:18,651 --> 01:43:20,986
A lot of damage has been done.

1336
01:43:21,153 --> 01:43:24,739
I'm responsible for a lot of it.
I know that.

1337
01:43:27,660 --> 01:43:30,787
I don't know. I keep thinking
there must be some rules

1338
01:43:30,955 --> 01:43:34,291
to tell me
what I'm supposed to do now.

1339
01:43:34,458 --> 01:43:38,378
But maybe not.

1340
01:43:42,341 --> 01:43:43,675
The person who told me

1341
01:43:43,843 --> 01:43:47,429
about the investigation of Mr. Quinn,
they were not leaking it.

1342
01:43:47,597 --> 01:43:51,016
They did not intend
for it to be printed.
I did that on my own.

1343
01:43:51,851 --> 01:43:55,478
I'm scared to death of going to jail,
but if I tell you who it was,

1344
01:43:55,646 --> 01:43:59,357
you'll have to do something about it,
and someone else will be hurt.

1345
01:43:59,525 --> 01:44:02,819
So it's really very simple.
I can hurt someone

1346
01:44:02,987 --> 01:44:04,946
or not hurt someone.

1347
01:44:05,114 --> 01:44:06,907
No rules.

1348
01:44:07,658 --> 01:44:08,992
Just...

1349
01:44:10,369 --> 01:44:11,620
me.

1350
01:44:16,876 --> 01:44:18,293
I can't tell you.

1351
01:44:28,512 --> 01:44:29,763
Mr. Gallagher.

1352
01:44:35,186 --> 01:44:38,313
I seem to wanna ask
if you set all this up.

1353
01:44:40,024 --> 01:44:42,692
If I do, you ain't gonna tell me,
are you?

1354
01:44:43,945 --> 01:44:45,612
No.

1355
01:44:48,157 --> 01:44:50,700
I'll tell you something.
You're a smart fellow.

1356
01:44:52,870 --> 01:44:54,788
Don't get too smart.

1357
01:44:54,956 --> 01:44:56,623
I'm pretty smart myself.

1358
01:44:59,585 --> 01:45:02,045
Everybody in the room is smart.

1359
01:45:02,880 --> 01:45:05,632
And everybody's
just doing their job.

1360
01:45:07,551 --> 01:45:09,844
And Teresa Perrone's dead.

1361
01:45:12,848 --> 01:45:14,975
Who do I see about that?

1362
01:45:17,019 --> 01:45:19,312
Ain't nobody to see.

1363
01:45:22,233 --> 01:45:24,150
I wish there was.

1364
01:45:26,070 --> 01:45:27,904
You're excused now, sir.

1365
01:45:39,709 --> 01:45:41,167
Ms. Carter, you can go too.

1366
01:45:42,128 --> 01:45:45,922
Later today I'll have
a statement for the media.

1367
01:45:46,465 --> 01:45:48,258
You ain't gonna like it.

1368
01:45:49,343 --> 01:45:53,596
It's gonna say Mr. Quinn here
may not be the smartest DA
we've ever had,

1369
01:45:53,764 --> 01:45:56,808
but there's no evidence
suspecting him of anything.

1370
01:45:56,976 --> 01:46:00,228
And it's gonna say you were
suckered by Mr. Rosen here

1371
01:46:00,396 --> 01:46:03,356
who has some peculiar ideas
on how to do his job.

1372
01:46:04,817 --> 01:46:07,777
It's gonna say it was premature
and real wrong

1373
01:46:07,945 --> 01:46:12,615
that these investigations
ever got reported in the first place.

1374
01:46:14,368 --> 01:46:18,455
You don't have to print it, of course,
but it's gonna wind up in the paper.

1375
01:46:21,751 --> 01:46:24,461
Angeline,
you and Elving go on ahead.

1376
01:46:24,628 --> 01:46:28,006
Robert, you can go too.
I'll be along in a minute.

1377
01:46:38,684 --> 01:46:41,311
Jim, you're in a bad place,
boy.

1378
01:46:42,021 --> 01:46:47,150
I could talk myself blue
clearing you, but wouldn't
nobody believe me.

1379
01:46:50,988 --> 01:46:53,656
You got a hell of
a publicity problem.

1380
01:46:55,242 --> 01:46:57,869
I could sue.
Who?

1381
01:46:58,079 --> 01:46:59,996
You can't win.

1382
01:47:00,164 --> 01:47:02,290
Absent malice,
what can you prove?

1383
01:47:03,751 --> 01:47:06,544
Saying I should resign?
The president appointed you.

1384
01:47:06,712 --> 01:47:10,173
I ain't the one to be kicking you out.
But I'd suggest it.

1385
01:47:15,096 --> 01:47:17,263
I'll talk to you later.

1386
01:47:27,525 --> 01:47:31,528
That's really too bad. I'm sorry.
Yeah.

1387
01:47:32,571 --> 01:47:36,032
He's a nice guy.
He just forgot about the rules.

1388
01:47:39,203 --> 01:47:42,038
What did you figure you'd do
after government service?

1389
01:47:42,206 --> 01:47:43,540
I'm not quitting.

1390
01:47:43,707 --> 01:47:46,960
You ain't no presidential appointee,
Elliott.

1391
01:47:47,628 --> 01:47:49,879
The one that hired you was me.

You got 30 days.

1393

Would you excuse me
for a moment, please?

1394
01:48:08,899 --> 01:48:10,233
Well...

01:48:12,611 --> 01:48:15,155

You got yourselves.

How'd you know I'd get the story?
I knew somebody would.

1398
01:48:23,789 --> 01:48:25,165
I'm sorry it was you.

1399
01:48:30,921 --> 01:48:32,922
How'd you know I'd print it?

1400
01:48:34,049 --> 01:48:35,592
It's news, isn't it?

1401
01:48:45,060 --> 01:48:49,189
Remember,
nothing's done yet.
Make sure that this is...

1402
01:49:24,308 --> 01:49:25,725
Davidek filled me in on it.

1403
01:49:25,893 --> 01:49:29,771
We're not gonna retract
anything, but we've got
a lot of explaining to do.

1404
01:49:29,939 --> 01:49:33,441

We'll handle it the best way we can.

say we were involved.
That's true, isn't it?

01:50:30,124 --> 01:50:31,165
No.

1412

Not so hot, really.

1416
01:51:18,881 --> 01:51:21,632
I went by your house.
There's a "for sale" sign out.

1417
01:51:21,800 --> 01:51:24,844
Yeah, it's sold.
Got a good price.

1418
01:51:29,058 --> 01:51:33,353
You got some sun.
Yeah, I've been sitting on the beach.

1419
01:51:35,356 --> 01:51:38,608
We were pretty famous for a week.
Did you read the story?

01:51:39,109 --> 01:51:40,610
Nope.

01:51:43,655 --> 01:51:45,073
Sure.

I don't know.

1425
01:52:05,052 --> 01:52:07,637
I guess I got a couple
of moves left in me.

1426
01:52:08,389 --> 01:52:09,722
But you don't know where?

1427
01:52:10,474 --> 01:52:12,266
Not sure.

1428
01:52:12,434 --> 01:52:17,980
People are going south and west,
but, uh, I think I'll go north and east.

1429
01:52:18,148 --> 01:52:20,691
You can go clear
to the Hudson River.

1430
01:52:20,859 --> 01:52:24,654
I mean, clear to Canada,
on the inland waterway.

1431
01:52:27,324 --> 01:52:30,493
The Northeast.
I was raised in the Northeast.

1432
01:52:30,661 --> 01:52:36,249
I had my first job there
the summer when I was 16
on the Berkshire Eagle.

1433
01:52:36,417 --> 01:52:39,001
I wonder if they'd have me back.

1434
01:52:39,586 --> 01:52:41,003
Feeling sorry for yourself?

1435
01:52:49,972 --> 01:52:53,015
I know you think
what I do for a living...

1436
01:52:54,226 --> 01:52:57,061
is nothing.

1437
01:52:57,229 --> 01:53:01,149
But it really isn't nothing.
I just did it badly.

1438
01:53:05,696 --> 01:53:09,615

northeast has something
to do with your daughter.

"Could I write?"
