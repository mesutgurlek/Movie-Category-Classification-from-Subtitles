1
00:03:28,301 --> 00:03:29,435
Doctor?
-Hm..

2
00:03:29,435 --> 00:03:32,404
There's a courier for you. sender ' Sana'.

3
00:03:33,072 --> 00:03:37,475
Item ''flowers''. Message ' Miss You'.
-Leave it there!

4
00:03:41,281 --> 00:03:42,475
Run the processor.

5
00:03:48,154 --> 00:03:49,451
Good! This is how to start.

6
00:03:54,294 --> 00:03:55,420
You idiot!

7
00:04:08,474 --> 00:04:10,101
Serve you right.

8
00:04:11,444 --> 00:04:16,282
He kicks like an unborn baby in the
mother's womb.

9
00:04:16,282 --> 00:04:19,274
What damage will he do when he is complete?

10
00:05:05,231 --> 00:05:08,200
Coffee?
-Thank you R2R.

11
00:05:09,102 --> 00:05:12,271
Hey, get me a filtered coffee?

12
00:05:12,271 --> 00:05:14,466
No coffee for Grade 2, only water.

13
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:18,272
Hey idiot, what about a Grade 3 than?
-Self service.

14
00:05:19,112 --> 00:05:20,477
There is no respect for humans in this lab.

15
00:06:06,259 --> 00:06:08,056
Walk like me.

16
00:06:18,271 --> 00:06:20,296
I'll start the data transfer, check the connection.

17
00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:15,056
He even poses like Bruce Lee.

18
00:07:48,327 --> 00:07:51,230
Don't you check emails or sms's in your lab?

19
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:55,268
Where is he? Why does he need a girlfriend?

20
00:07:55,268 --> 00:07:56,335
Is he still alive?

21
00:07:56,335 --> 00:07:58,504
He is busy. He'll get angry if anyone disturbs.

22
00:07:58,504 --> 00:08:02,270
Let it be, tell him I am here.
-Go fast!

23
00:08:03,309 --> 00:08:06,335
Sana, do you have a sister?
-No!

24
00:08:12,518 --> 00:08:15,419
How many times have I told you not to
disturb me? Get out!

25
00:08:17,323 --> 00:08:19,292
He threw the metal on my head.

26
00:08:19,292 --> 00:08:20,350
Not even Obama can see him now.

27
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:24,088
Did you tell him it's me?
-Yes! He asked you to call later.

28
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:26,061
Ask him to throw his handphone!

29
00:08:35,274 --> 00:08:38,004
Tell him that I'll never meet him after this!

30
00:08:49,322 --> 00:08:52,291
Give it some speech training, I'll be back shortly.

31
00:08:53,192 --> 00:08:54,489
''Hey macha!''. Repeat?

32
00:08:55,361 --> 00:08:58,091
What is that look for?

33
00:08:58,464 --> 00:09:03,069
Donkey! Idiot!

34
00:09:03,069 --> 00:09:06,072
Answer us, you metal head!

35
00:09:06,072 --> 00:09:09,075
Did you teach it something useful?
-We...

36
00:09:09,075 --> 00:09:11,043
..didn't expect you back so soon.
-Tell me!

37
00:09:11,277 --> 00:09:13,370
''Hey macha!''. Repeat?

38
00:09:14,113 --> 00:09:18,049
''What is that look for?'

39
00:09:19,018 --> 00:09:23,148
''Donkey! Idiot!''

40
00:09:24,457 --> 00:09:28,052
''Answer us, you metal head!''

41
00:09:30,262 --> 00:09:32,298
What's all this? Is this speech training?

42
00:09:32,298 --> 00:09:34,333
Not me, it was Siva.

43
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:38,292
I wanted to start from Chennai Tamil and
proceed to proper Tamil....

44
00:09:38,537 --> 00:09:41,340
This is my 10 years effort!

45
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:45,333
I'll punish you severely if you repeat this
again!

46
00:09:48,481 --> 00:09:51,250
So, you think you can get us into trouble?

47
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,377
I will dismantle and send you to a
metal dealer!

48
00:09:55,121 --> 00:09:56,383
Let's go before we get bitten.

49
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:00,280
Success! Next is the ARD approval right?

50
00:11:00,553 --> 00:11:04,080
No Siva. Although he's been fully
programmed..

51
00:11:04,323 --> 00:11:07,258
..he's still a machine, like a new born baby.

52
00:11:07,426 --> 00:11:13,299
We must observe how he uses his
knowledge...

53
00:11:13,299 --> 00:11:16,325
..and behaves among real people.

54
00:11:16,435 --> 00:11:17,503
Only then can we take him to ARD.

55
00:11:17,503 --> 00:11:20,172
Let him mingle?
-Dot!

56
00:11:20,172 --> 00:11:21,332
It's going to get interesting now.

57
00:11:26,545 --> 00:11:28,206
I'm coming!

58
00:11:28,414 --> 00:11:31,283
It's been months since we last saw him.

59
00:11:31,283 --> 00:11:33,308
Ruining his health with all those researches.

60
00:11:34,353 --> 00:11:37,413
Hi mum!
-Vasi, you look like a priest on a holiday.

61
00:11:38,124 --> 00:11:41,218
Hi dad! I have a surprise for you.
-What is it?

62
00:11:44,196 --> 00:11:48,257
What's this? Did you clone yourself?
-No dad!

63
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,369
Don't confuse us. Who are you?

64
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:57,133
He's worse than you.

65
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:01,280
Dad, I created him.There are many types
of robots.

66
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:05,216
This is an andro humanoid robot, a machine
that resembles human.

67
00:12:07,119 --> 00:12:08,487
This is mother.
-Mother!

68
00:12:08,487 --> 00:12:11,217
Yes, now show your respect.

69
00:12:14,493 --> 00:12:16,128
It behaves like a human?

70
00:12:16,128 --> 00:12:19,325
It can do everything a human can and can't do.

71
00:12:20,232 --> 00:12:22,097
So you don't need them anymore.

72
00:12:22,368 --> 00:12:24,233
No dad, I still need them.

73
00:12:24,503 --> 00:12:28,098
Who else will clean and dress the robot?

74
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,410
You are turning a MSC graduate into a
babysitter?

75
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:33,469
Vasi, come and eat.

76
00:12:35,314 --> 00:12:37,339
Robot, join us. I'll serve you hot idly.

77
00:12:37,449 --> 00:12:41,078
What? You'll even give him curry and meat.

78
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:44,290
Mum, it only needs 2 units of electricity daily.

79
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:47,193
Why didn't you name him yet?

80
00:12:47,193 --> 00:12:49,395
Mum, choose a name for him.

81
00:12:49,395 --> 00:12:52,331
If you had a brother, I wanted to name him
Chitti Babu.

82
00:12:52,331 --> 00:12:54,492
We can call him Chitti.

83
00:12:57,503 --> 00:12:59,494
Chitti, go and drop the TV.

84
00:13:08,347 --> 00:13:10,416
Mum, he will do exactly as told.

85
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:13,010
You must tell him to switch it on.

86
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:17,423
Where are you leaving to so soon?
To the lab?

87
00:13:17,423 --> 00:13:20,256
No, I am need a haircut and to meet Sana.
She's angry.

88
00:13:22,494 --> 00:13:24,257
Who will drive?
-Chitti!

89
00:13:25,364 --> 00:13:27,299
Doctor, please don't. It's risky.

90
00:13:27,299 --> 00:13:30,530
Are you coming?
-No, my stomach is upset. You go ahead.
-I haven't informed my parents, you go ahead.

91
00:13:36,308 --> 00:13:39,038
Careful doctor, he might break the gearbox.

92
00:13:39,144 --> 00:13:42,045
That's why I am here.
-He broke the TVwhile you are here.

93
00:13:42,514 --> 00:13:44,450
Just follow my instructions.

94
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:46,252
Don't do anything without my permission.

95
00:13:46,252 --> 00:13:48,152
Ok doctor, where to go?
-The park.

96
00:14:00,099 --> 00:14:01,327
Idiot, why didn't hit the break?

97
00:14:01,433 --> 00:14:04,061
You told me not to do anything without
your permission.

98
00:14:04,403 --> 00:14:09,238
Hey fool, are you drunk?
-No, this car uses petrol.

99
00:14:09,341 --> 00:14:11,206
Don't answer all these, let's go.

100
00:14:17,316 --> 00:14:20,486
Don't cut very short,just 1 /4 inch is enough.

101
00:14:20,486 --> 00:14:23,284
I will cut as if I'm cutting fingernails.

102
00:14:24,123 --> 00:14:28,127
Haven't seen you in awhile.Was it a vow?
-No,just work.

103
00:14:28,127 --> 00:14:30,129
Is he your brother?
-Yes!

104
00:14:30,129 --> 00:14:33,098
Do you need a hair cut?
-No, I'm using a wig.

105
00:14:33,365 --> 00:14:37,096
Wig? How old is he?
-1 day.

106
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:40,131
He's fooling us.

107
00:14:41,307 --> 00:14:43,104
Here, read these books.

108
00:14:47,313 --> 00:14:49,042
Is he counting the pages?

109
00:14:59,158 --> 00:15:00,216
Any other books?

110
00:15:02,094 --> 00:15:04,396
Have you finished reading?
-Yes!

111
00:15:04,396 --> 00:15:07,058
There's only the telephone directory left.

112
00:15:17,343 --> 00:15:19,378
You finished reading it too?
-Yes!

113
00:15:19,378 --> 00:15:21,209
Do you know all the numbers?
-Yes!

114
00:15:21,313 --> 00:15:22,371
What is Kamalhassan's number?

115
00:15:26,251 --> 00:15:28,287
Everyone knows it.Tell me my number.

116
00:15:28,287 --> 00:15:30,221
What is your name?
-Bhajanlal.

117
00:15:35,294 --> 00:15:38,263
There are 1 2 Bhajanlal's.Tell me your initial?
-K. Bhajanlal.

118
00:15:39,398 --> 00:15:41,400
There are 3 K.Bhajanlal's.Tell me your address?

119
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,392
No 6, Mannaradi Street, Sowcapet.

120
00:15:49,341 --> 00:15:54,244
My number is 444 333 21. Tell me my name?

121
00:15:54,546 --> 00:15:56,411
Hello Mr P. Pithambaram.

122
00:16:09,094 --> 00:16:11,426
Hi sweetheart!
-Broken heart!What?

123
00:16:15,167 --> 00:16:17,102
I was very busy in the lab.

124
00:16:17,102 --> 00:16:19,127
Remain there, who asked you to come here?

125
00:16:20,105 --> 00:16:21,473
I understand that you are angry.

126
00:16:21,473 --> 00:16:24,443
How many phone calls, sms's and mails?

127
00:16:24,443 --> 00:16:26,274
How many times did I come there?

128
00:16:27,212 --> 00:16:29,214
Did you speak a word to me?

129
00:16:29,214 --> 00:16:32,081
I hate you.
-Look here Sana..

130
00:16:33,118 --> 00:16:35,450
I don't know what is happening around me
when I'm at work.

131
00:16:36,422 --> 00:16:39,491
If you knew what I was doing.....
-Excuse me! I have a class now.

132
00:16:39,491 --> 00:16:41,482
Come to Jeeva Park in the evening and we'll
talk further.

133
00:16:42,061 --> 00:16:43,460
I love you! We'll meet in the evening.

134
00:16:46,098 --> 00:16:48,367
I'm meeting you to end our relationship,
not to romance.

135
00:16:48,367 --> 00:16:50,436
End the relationship!What do you mean?

136
00:16:50,436 --> 00:16:52,438
If we marry, you'll be too occupied for me.

137
00:16:52,438 --> 00:16:56,508
Rather than getting divorced later, let's end
our relationship now.

138
00:16:56,508 --> 00:16:59,409
I'll go my way, and you go your way.

139
00:17:16,462 --> 00:17:17,451
This is the document to end our relationship.

140
00:17:18,097 --> 00:17:21,100
Here are the letters and greeting cards you
sent to me.

141
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:22,465
Look at the book that you gave me.

142
00:17:27,139 --> 00:17:29,073
You gave me Lord Muruga's photo for
Valentines.

143
00:17:29,274 --> 00:17:32,038
Have you ever bought me anything special?

144
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,281
Is this the one?

145
00:17:36,281 --> 00:17:38,272
Will anyone present a shaver to a girl?

146
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,443
I thought you might need it.
-Your face!

147
00:17:47,126 --> 00:17:49,128
I returned everything that you gave me.

148
00:17:49,128 --> 00:17:53,132
Please sign this. There's nothing between us
anymore.

149
00:17:53,132 --> 00:17:54,433
Is that all?
-Yes!

150
00:17:54,433 --> 00:17:56,435
Have you returned everything?
-Yes!

151
00:17:56,435 --> 00:18:00,098
What about the 51 2 kisses that I gave you?

152
00:18:01,173 --> 00:18:03,075
You even count the kisses you gave me?

153
00:18:03,075 --> 00:18:06,044
Don't you ever feel anything?

154
00:18:06,044 --> 00:18:08,447
I can't return that.
-Only than it's official.

155
00:18:08,447 --> 00:18:10,381
It's unfair, I won't agree to it.

156
00:18:10,449 --> 00:18:12,349
I will not sign the documents then.

157
00:18:13,185 --> 00:18:14,345
He is so annoying!

158
00:18:17,156 --> 00:18:18,180
Close your eyes!

159
00:18:25,164 --> 00:18:26,222
What is this?

160
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:29,161
Is this how I kissed you?
-Then?

161
00:18:29,368 --> 00:18:32,271
Held your hips, hold you tight...

162
00:18:32,271 --> 00:18:38,210
I won't do it.
-Our deal is cancelled then.

163
00:18:39,044 --> 00:18:42,275
I will disturb you every day.
-You are a torture!

164
00:18:43,415 --> 00:18:45,474
Let everything end today.

165
00:18:46,485 --> 00:18:48,043
Come near.

166
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,344
Close your eyes.

167
00:18:51,256 --> 00:18:52,348
Don't smile.

168
00:18:58,263 --> 00:19:00,288
Is it ok?
-Too much gap.

169
00:19:02,367 --> 00:19:03,334
Closer..

170
00:24:46,511 --> 00:24:48,206
What is this?
-Star fruit.

171
00:24:48,446 --> 00:24:50,437
Star fruit?
-Where's the driver?

172
00:24:51,316 --> 00:24:53,443
Which driver? There are so many drivers.

173
00:24:53,518 --> 00:24:55,452
Engine driver, taxi driver, screwdriver.

174
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,356
Where's the driver of this car?
-It's me.

175
00:24:58,356 --> 00:25:02,093
Why did you park at a no parking area?
-It only stated no parking.

176
00:25:02,093 --> 00:25:04,061
It did not state no parking Dr. Vasegaran's car.

177
00:25:04,229 --> 00:25:06,288
Are you making fun of me?
-No, I'm answering you.

178
00:25:08,366 --> 00:25:10,300
Show me your driving license?
-I don't have one.

179
00:25:10,435 --> 00:25:14,030
How can you drive without a license?
-It's been programmed.

180
00:25:14,205 --> 00:25:16,503
Don't try to fool me, follow me to the station.
-Which station?

181
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:20,009
Are you making fun?

182
00:25:20,312 --> 00:25:22,113
What is your name?
-Chitti!

183
00:25:22,113 --> 00:25:24,081
Tell me your address?
-I only have IP address.

184
00:25:25,584 --> 00:25:28,314
Your answers are not related.

185
00:25:28,386 --> 00:25:29,444
What is your father's name?
-I don't have one.

186
00:25:29,588 --> 00:25:31,222
Mother?
-I don't have one.

187
00:25:31,222 --> 00:25:32,416
Are you an orphan?
-No.

188
00:25:33,124 --> 00:25:35,388
How were you born then?
- I wasn't born, I was made.

189
00:25:36,528 --> 00:25:42,267
They made you? Are you mad?
-No. Everything is fitted tightly.

190
00:25:42,267 --> 00:25:45,065
Are you trying to be funny?
-No, the bolts are made of nickel.

191
00:25:45,437 --> 00:25:48,065
Stop it!
-Tell me exactly what to stop.

192
00:25:52,611 --> 00:25:55,375
Why must we argue? It's a parking offence.

193
00:25:55,614 --> 00:25:59,209
You don't have a driving licence, and you talk
a lot.

194
00:25:59,517 --> 00:26:02,145
You'll be fined Rs1000 if you go to court.

195
00:26:03,254 --> 00:26:05,457
Do you want to go to court or settle it here?

196
00:26:05,457 --> 00:26:08,255
I will settle it here.
-That's the way.

197
00:26:11,563 --> 00:26:15,166
I have looked at you.
-Don't make me angry.

198
00:26:15,166 --> 00:26:17,100
Don't you know how to settle?

199
00:26:18,069 --> 00:26:20,060
Give me a cut.
-Where to give?

200
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:26,199
In my hand. Do it quick.

201
00:26:29,114 --> 00:26:31,173
He sliced my hand!

202
00:26:32,183 --> 00:26:35,448
Chitti, what happened?
-He asked me to cut, so I cut.

203
00:26:37,188 --> 00:26:39,383
Who is he? He looks like you.
-Get in the car and I'll tell you.

204
00:26:39,491 --> 00:26:42,483
Let's go.
-Wait, don't go.

205
00:26:43,194 --> 00:26:45,287
Is he your brother? Are you twins?
-No.

206
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:47,455
Drive fast, we'll be in trouble if we get
caught.

207
00:26:47,565 --> 00:26:49,430
Is he your friend?
-No.

208
00:26:50,268 --> 00:26:52,437
Driver? He doesn't look like one.

209
00:26:52,437 --> 00:26:55,463
I'll tell you in detail. Just see if they are
following us.

210
00:27:01,579 --> 00:27:02,409
Turn your head.

211
00:27:03,081 --> 00:27:05,015
Why do you simply turn your head?

212
00:27:05,083 --> 00:27:06,451
You told me to check if they are following us.

213
00:27:06,451 --> 00:27:10,353
You can use the rear view mirror.
-You should have told me.

214
00:27:59,137 --> 00:28:00,399
He is equal to a hundred men.

215
00:28:01,072 --> 00:28:03,404
Knowledge equal to a hundred men has been
programmed into him.

216
00:28:04,375 --> 00:28:08,209
He knows all the arts and languages of
this world.

217
00:28:17,455 --> 00:28:20,424
His eyes are not just to see, but also to show.

218
00:28:26,464 --> 00:28:28,261
We can speak to him virtually.

219
00:28:28,566 --> 00:28:30,056
With these type of robots..

220
00:28:30,268 --> 00:28:33,260
..our nation's security will be enhanced
by a hundred times.

221
00:28:33,438 --> 00:28:35,338
You may ask Chitti any questions.

222
00:28:35,607 --> 00:28:41,112
I will ask a simple question. Is 241 5781 7 a
Fibonacci number?

223
00:28:41,112 --> 00:28:44,182
Yes. It's the 22nd Fibonacci number.

224
00:28:44,182 --> 00:28:47,276
It is also Mandavali P. Subramaniam's
phone number.

225
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:52,118
What is the biggest prime number that
you know?

226
00:28:56,494 --> 00:29:00,362
M 44, it'll take you several years to figure out
if it is right or wrong.

227
00:29:12,477 --> 00:29:14,001
What rhythm is this?

228
00:29:14,179 --> 00:29:16,409
You started and finished in a different rhythm,
and in between..

229
00:29:22,187 --> 00:29:23,518
..you went slightly off key at this point.

230
00:29:29,093 --> 00:29:31,529
Does God exists?
-Who is God?

231
00:29:31,529 --> 00:29:33,097
The one who created us.

232
00:29:33,097 --> 00:29:36,225
Dr Vaseegaran created me, so God does exist.

233
00:30:00,425 --> 00:30:01,483
Such a wonderful creation.

234
00:30:05,129 --> 00:30:06,460
Do you know how to paint?
-Yes.

235
00:30:06,564 --> 00:30:08,293
Can you sketch a portrait of me?
-Sure.

236
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:27,313
Can I take a picture with you?
-Sure.

237
00:30:32,357 --> 00:30:33,517
See how they are fussing over him?

238
00:30:36,327 --> 00:30:41,128
Hi, I'm the co-scientist. I fixed all his motors.

239
00:30:42,166 --> 00:30:43,201
I'm the deputy scientist, Ravi.

240
00:30:43,201 --> 00:30:44,395
Deputy scientist?
-It means labourer.

241
00:30:45,203 --> 00:30:47,103
I am in charge of his clothes.

242
00:30:50,208 --> 00:30:52,176
Why are all of you interested in him?

243
00:30:52,243 --> 00:30:53,437
He may have the capability of a hundred men..

244
00:30:53,544 --> 00:30:56,513
..but he doesn't have one important part
that we have.

245
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:02,420
What is the one thing they have that I don't?

246
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:04,479
Why didn't you give it to me?
-He has complained to him.

247
00:31:05,523 --> 00:31:07,525
Don't you know what to talk to him?

248
00:31:07,525 --> 00:31:10,228
No, what we meant was his lack of emotions..

249
00:31:10,228 --> 00:31:11,429
Don't change the story.

250
00:31:11,429 --> 00:31:13,226
Your 1 month salary will be deducted.

251
00:31:22,273 --> 00:31:23,262
You have told me.

252
00:31:23,341 --> 00:31:25,172
The head of ARD, your mentor.

253
00:31:25,243 --> 00:31:26,505
His picture is in our lab.

254
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:36,478
What about your motors?

255
00:31:44,495 --> 00:31:47,165
Can you tell me about your neural scheme?
-No.

256
00:31:47,165 --> 00:31:48,097
Why?

257
00:31:49,334 --> 00:31:53,293
I'm Vaseegaran's professor, you can tell me.
There's no harm.

258
00:31:53,371 --> 00:31:55,306
Let me check and confirm.
-No! No!

259
00:31:55,306 --> 00:31:58,241
He's asking about my neural scheme,
should I tell?

260
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:03,041
It is not wrong that you asked, but....

261
00:32:03,114 --> 00:32:06,277
..I hesitate to tell anyone before I get it
patented..

262
00:32:06,417 --> 00:32:09,181
..because it can be easily misused.

263
00:32:10,421 --> 00:32:15,085
I just asked him casually to test his
knowledge.

264
00:32:17,295 --> 00:32:19,364
After I complete my study on him, I will
bring him to you..

265
00:32:19,364 --> 00:32:21,332
..for the ARD evaluation.

266
00:32:32,176 --> 00:32:34,512
Vasi, I like Chitti very much.

267
00:32:34,512 --> 00:32:37,215
Can I take him home for two days?

268
00:32:37,215 --> 00:32:40,343
Is he a doll or teddy bear to keep for
two days?

269
00:32:40,585 --> 00:32:44,188
No Vasi, it's my final exams. I did not..

270
00:32:44,188 --> 00:32:45,382
..study properly as I was upset with you.

271
00:32:45,456 --> 00:32:48,584
Chitti can help me if he's around.

272
00:32:50,161 --> 00:32:52,129
Ok, take him. You both follow them.

273
00:32:53,131 --> 00:32:56,123
Gents are not allowed in my home.
-Who said we are gents?

274
00:32:56,367 --> 00:32:57,527
It's ok, call me if there's anything.

275
00:33:21,325 --> 00:33:24,128
Idiot, walk forward.

276
00:33:24,128 --> 00:33:25,152
Walk forward.

277
00:33:38,142 --> 00:33:40,235
Not bun, it's gun!

278
00:33:52,356 --> 00:33:55,291
I programmed you with 8 lakhs worth of
line of codes.

279
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:58,122
I told you to take gun, but you took bun.

280
00:34:03,534 --> 00:34:06,435
Vaseegaran is my student, he achieved it.

281
00:34:07,238 --> 00:34:11,299
His creation received a standing ovation
at the conference.

282
00:34:11,476 --> 00:34:14,070
You lie upside down and....

283
00:34:15,313 --> 00:34:17,247
Give me your life!
Give me your life!

284
00:34:17,415 --> 00:34:19,246
Let go of my neck.

285
00:34:20,384 --> 00:34:24,377
Give me your life!
Give me your life!

286
00:34:54,085 --> 00:34:56,187
What does happy home mean?

287
00:34:56,187 --> 00:34:58,417
Dad was an army officer. At the age of 40..

288
00:34:58,489 --> 00:35:00,124
.. he died in the Cargill War.

289
00:35:00,124 --> 00:35:03,423
We were very sad and depressed.

290
00:35:04,262 --> 00:35:06,287
We wondered how long we were going to
suffer like this.

291
00:35:06,531 --> 00:35:10,023
How many of them would have lost their
husbands or sons?

292
00:35:10,268 --> 00:35:13,362
We started this to show them love and care.

293
00:35:14,105 --> 00:35:18,075
No one can change the past or stop
the future.

294
00:35:18,075 --> 00:35:20,278
For now, let everyone just be happy.

295
00:35:20,278 --> 00:35:22,075
That is why it's named Happy Home.

296
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:25,249
Is your baby kicking you?

297
00:35:25,249 --> 00:35:28,082
I'll ask him to kick you once he's out.

298
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:35,226
Who is he? Why allow gents in here?

299
00:35:35,226 --> 00:35:36,318
Is he your boyfriend?

300
00:35:36,394 --> 00:35:38,362
Not boyfriend, but toy friend.

301
00:35:38,596 --> 00:35:41,190
His Chitti, and he is a robot.

302
00:35:41,299 --> 00:35:44,462
Robot? Are you lying?
-It's true.

303
00:35:50,441 --> 00:35:52,409
Don't scare them, put it back.

304
00:35:55,313 --> 00:35:57,543
Mum, you'll be amazed by his capabilities.

305
00:35:57,648 --> 00:35:59,350
Can it cook?
-Yes!

306
00:35:59,350 --> 00:36:02,376
Prepare something to eat, while I have
my shower.

307
00:36:36,487 --> 00:36:39,257
One more day left, and a lot more to study.

308
00:36:39,257 --> 00:36:44,217
I'll tell you what I studied, stop me if
I'm wrong.

309
00:36:54,305 --> 00:36:55,431
Have you studied all?

310
00:36:58,142 --> 00:36:59,268
Ok, I will test you.

311
00:37:00,077 --> 00:37:03,046
What are Monozygotic and Di-zygotic twins?

312
00:37:09,387 --> 00:37:12,413
You can become a doctor in one day if you
study like this.

313
00:37:38,082 --> 00:37:40,243
Can't bear their nuisance every day.

314
00:37:43,254 --> 00:37:45,381
Why is it so noisy? Reduce the volume.

315
00:37:48,125 --> 00:37:52,459
I spent Rs 10 lakhs to buy a deck,
amplifier and woofer..

316
00:37:53,297 --> 00:37:57,134
..and you expect us to use headphones?

317
00:37:57,134 --> 00:37:59,337
Many of them are studying for exams.

318
00:37:59,337 --> 00:38:01,032
There are heart patients as well.

319
00:38:04,442 --> 00:38:08,071
Ask them to cover their ears with cottons.

320
00:38:17,288 --> 00:38:19,523
Chitti, do something.
-Don't worry.

321
00:38:19,523 --> 00:38:22,253
Remote control uses infrared, I'll handle it.

322
00:38:47,284 --> 00:38:48,444
Shut your ears!

323
00:38:59,296 --> 00:39:00,160
Reduce the volume.

324
00:39:02,433 --> 00:39:08,338
It's too loud, can you reduce it?

325
00:39:53,117 --> 00:39:56,253
We are celebrating our temple's festival..

326
00:39:56,253 --> 00:39:58,122
..and you ask us to reduce the volume?

327
00:39:58,122 --> 00:39:59,384
We can't study for exams.

328
00:40:00,124 --> 00:40:04,083
Pray to God and go, you'll pass
your exams.

329
00:40:05,129 --> 00:40:07,097
You do the same when you organise any
party.

330
00:40:10,434 --> 00:40:12,425
No more disturbance, let's go.

331
00:40:13,337 --> 00:40:16,465
He broke our set.
-Hey, stop there.

332
00:40:18,442 --> 00:40:19,466
I said stop.

333
00:40:39,497 --> 00:40:47,495
Goddess Kali!

334
00:40:54,178 --> 00:40:55,338
What's this?

335
00:40:56,247 --> 00:40:59,114
He is a magician.
-He took all our weapons.

336
00:41:29,613 --> 00:41:33,150
Why are you crying?
-I will definitely fail.

337
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:35,380
I have not studied at all. I'm running
out of time.

338
00:41:35,519 --> 00:41:37,248
My head is spinning just looking at
this book.

339
00:41:37,321 --> 00:41:39,516
Shall I write on your behalf?
-You don't understand.

340
00:41:40,124 --> 00:41:44,161
You can't write because we have photo id
and an exam card.

341
00:41:44,161 --> 00:41:47,130
Then, we'll do a zig-B.
-What is that?

342
00:42:09,186 --> 00:42:10,210
What are you doing here?

343
00:42:11,322 --> 00:42:14,291
Sana is doing her exam and I'm giving her
the answers.

344
00:42:15,426 --> 00:42:16,450
How can you do it from here?

345
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,494
I have a built in data transmitter.

346
00:42:19,063 --> 00:42:21,088
Sana has a trans receiver in her ear.

347
00:42:23,334 --> 00:42:25,469
Is this a high-tech bit?
-Not bit, it's byte.

348
00:42:25,469 --> 00:42:30,202
I have sent 2Mb of data so far.
-See how they cheat these days?

349
00:42:31,308 --> 00:42:34,144
Wait, I'll come as soon as the umbilical cord
detached.

350
00:42:34,144 --> 00:42:36,510
What?
-You better come before I call the security.

351
00:42:47,458 --> 00:42:51,087
He said you have a trans receiver and you're
receiving answers from him.

352
00:42:51,161 --> 00:42:52,185
Who said?
-I did.

353
00:42:52,296 --> 00:42:55,129
I don't know him.
-Why are you lying?

354
00:42:59,470 --> 00:43:01,438
He's blabbering, I think he is mad.

355
00:43:01,538 --> 00:43:04,200
I don't have brains, only a CPU and it's in a
perfect condition.

356
00:43:04,274 --> 00:43:06,105
No doubt he's mental.

357
00:43:08,112 --> 00:43:11,138
I assumed he's an old student when I saw
him talking to himself.

358
00:43:11,448 --> 00:43:13,584
You may leave now and continue detaching
he umbilical cord.

359
00:43:13,584 --> 00:43:16,178
Sana, how are you going to answer the
questions?

360
00:43:16,286 --> 00:43:18,254
Let her deal with it, you leave first.

361
00:43:58,529 --> 00:44:01,298
I would have definitely failed if you had not
helped me.

362
00:44:01,298 --> 00:44:03,095
Why dirty my cheeks for that?

363
00:44:08,472 --> 00:44:11,202
They will ban me for three years if I was
caught cheating.

364
00:44:11,341 --> 00:44:14,174
That's why I had to tell them that I didn't
know you.

365
00:44:14,478 --> 00:44:17,106
Please don't be upset.
-I don't have feelings.

366
00:44:17,181 --> 00:44:20,082
I learned that humans will lie to protect
themselves.

367
00:44:28,092 --> 00:44:30,356
Leave this place, go to the next compartment.

368
00:44:30,427 --> 00:44:33,089
He's the one.

369
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:39,333
Are you a thug? Fight now!

370
00:44:41,271 --> 00:44:44,308
What are you looking at? You can't grab
anything now.

371
00:44:44,308 --> 00:44:46,333
We attached rocks to it.
-Come now.

372
00:44:46,510 --> 00:44:49,146
Why are they calling?
-Keep quiet.

373
00:44:49,146 --> 00:44:52,411
You brought him the other day, ask him
to fight now.

374
00:44:56,653 --> 00:45:00,453
Chitti, my purse! I have my hall ticket and
id in it.

375
00:45:27,251 --> 00:45:29,082
You destroyed my home theatre system..

376
00:45:29,153 --> 00:45:31,451
..now I will destroy you.

377
00:45:35,492 --> 00:45:36,459
Hold her!

378
00:46:17,534 --> 00:46:19,434
Chitti, beat them up.

379
00:47:45,055 --> 00:47:46,454
Hold him tight.

380
00:49:55,318 --> 00:49:59,448
You'll be amazed to know what Chitti did.

381
00:50:05,495 --> 00:50:09,431
If only he was human, I would have fallen for
him instead of you.

382
00:50:11,435 --> 00:50:15,030
Why do you look upset?
-No!

383
00:50:19,509 --> 00:50:22,342
Whatever he does, the credit goes to you.

384
00:50:24,581 --> 00:50:27,184
My love will always belong to you.

385
00:54:54,150 --> 00:54:59,389
What? You are looking as though there's a
salsa dance.

386
00:54:59,389 --> 00:55:01,191
Are you planning to complaint about this too?

387
00:55:01,191 --> 00:55:04,092
I'm troubleshooting peripheral's for
tomorrow's ARD evaluation.

388
00:55:04,561 --> 00:55:07,257
Are you so special?
-What you said is wrong.

389
00:55:07,497 --> 00:55:09,362
He thinks he is a poet.

390
00:55:14,471 --> 00:55:17,374
A famous poet once said this.
-Stop it!

391
00:55:17,374 --> 00:55:21,344
We don't care who and what was said.

392
00:55:21,344 --> 00:55:23,113
You think you are better just because..

393
00:55:23,113 --> 00:55:24,512
..your knowledge is better than us?
-Yes!

394
00:55:25,081 --> 00:55:27,317
What? Can you drink like us?

395
00:55:27,317 --> 00:55:30,286
Can you smoke like us?
-Can you eat briyani?

396
00:55:30,286 --> 00:55:32,049
Can you vomit after eating?

397
00:55:32,122 --> 00:55:35,353
Can you spit?
-Can you urinate against the wall?

398
00:55:35,425 --> 00:55:37,450
Is that the only difference between human
and me?

399
00:55:39,562 --> 00:55:42,332
It seems like sarcasm
-Yes, it is.

400
00:55:42,332 --> 00:55:44,334
My rule list says that I should not consume all
these.

401
00:55:44,334 --> 00:55:46,529
That rule list also says that you must listen
to us right?

402
00:55:47,070 --> 00:55:48,471
Yes!
-Then drink this.

403
00:55:48,471 --> 00:55:49,403
Eat this briyani.

404
00:55:49,506 --> 00:55:52,407
Wait, let me confirm with the doctor.
-Don't inform the doctor!

405
00:55:54,310 --> 00:55:57,113
They asked me to consume alcohol and
eat briyani.

406
00:55:57,113 --> 00:55:58,603
It's against the rule list.What should I do?

407
00:55:59,082 --> 00:56:00,242
Beat them with slippers.

408
00:56:04,454 --> 00:56:09,187
Give me your slippers.
-Slippers? Take it!

409
00:56:09,392 --> 00:56:12,418
Are you going to eat it?
-He might.

410
00:56:17,066 --> 00:56:19,227
He's really hitting us.

411
00:56:21,271 --> 00:56:24,274
Everyone is looking at us, it's embarrassing.
Stop it Chitti.

412
00:56:24,274 --> 00:56:26,435
Task incomplete.
-Incomplete?

413
00:56:32,215 --> 00:56:34,080
Serves you right.
-We don't want.

414
00:56:34,184 --> 00:56:36,219
Do you have brains?
-No!

415
00:56:36,219 --> 00:56:38,050
I told you to prepare him for tomorrow's
evaluation..

416
00:56:38,121 --> 00:56:39,213
..but you ask him to do nonsense.
-He's lying.

417
00:56:42,058 --> 00:56:44,219
Machines won't lie, only humans does.

418
00:56:59,375 --> 00:57:01,277
Human life is so precious.

419
00:57:01,277 --> 00:57:04,547
Many armed soldiers die in the war.

420
00:57:04,547 --> 00:57:06,481
Many families lose their members.

421
00:57:07,050 --> 00:57:10,383
We won't suffer losses if we use robots
instead of humans.

422
00:57:11,087 --> 00:57:13,521
My intention was to create many andro
humanoid robots..

423
00:57:14,123 --> 00:57:16,148
..and deliver them to our armed force.

424
00:57:16,259 --> 00:57:17,556
ARD's approval is compulsory for this to
happen.

425
00:57:18,027 --> 00:57:19,995
I humbly request all the scientist and officers
here..

426
00:57:20,096 --> 00:57:23,463
..to evaluate Chitti and grant me the approval.

427
00:57:24,567 --> 00:57:28,104
Is this robot built not to endanger human life..

428
00:57:28,104 --> 00:57:30,129
.. as stated in the ASIMO rules?

429
00:57:30,206 --> 00:57:31,434
This robot is not created in such a way..

430
00:57:31,541 --> 00:57:36,171
..because it may have to kill the life of an
enemy in war.

431
00:57:47,624 --> 00:57:51,227
Greek Ecklas said that in a tortoise race..

432
00:57:51,227 --> 00:57:53,463
.. even if the tortoise leaves early..

433
00:57:53,463 --> 00:57:57,422
..it will win the race. Do you know that?
-Yes!

434
00:57:59,335 --> 00:58:03,032
In reality, because of its seriousness, even
Ecklas can win the race.

435
00:58:04,173 --> 00:58:06,971
What do you think? Should we approve?

436
00:58:10,079 --> 00:58:12,248
Do you know the value of a human life?

437
00:58:12,248 --> 00:58:14,384
It depends on which life.

438
00:58:14,384 --> 00:58:20,050
If in danger, who would you save?
Einstein or a child?

439
00:58:31,234 --> 00:58:33,293
Turn around!Walk!

440
00:58:55,358 --> 00:58:56,484
Stab Vaseegaran.

441
00:59:09,372 --> 00:59:12,342
It's a dangerous machine. It can kill anyone.

442
00:59:12,342 --> 00:59:14,277
It can't be approved.

443
00:59:14,277 --> 00:59:17,405
You confused it by giving unwanted commands.

444
00:59:19,349 --> 00:59:22,079
It doesn't know good, bad, friends or enemies.

445
00:59:25,588 --> 00:59:27,215
If allowed in our armed force..

446
00:59:28,358 --> 00:59:31,094
..it might kill our own men instead of enemies.

447
00:59:31,094 --> 00:59:32,462
It is dangerous to be let out.

448
00:59:32,462 --> 00:59:34,396
It has sliced a traffic police's hand.

449
00:59:35,264 --> 00:59:39,402
It thrashed an electric train and broke some
passenger's bones.

450
00:59:39,402 --> 00:59:45,068
It is only suitable to work in a factory.

451
00:59:53,316 --> 00:59:55,216
Are you angry with me?

452
00:59:58,254 --> 01:00:00,017
I'm not angry with you.

453
01:00:00,390 --> 01:00:02,449
I just don't want science to be misinterpreted.

454
01:00:18,608 --> 01:00:20,443
What you did was wrong.

455
01:00:20,443 --> 01:00:21,577
What was my mistake?

456
01:00:21,577 --> 01:00:24,045
You told me to do as he says.

457
01:00:24,113 --> 01:00:25,381
Must you stab if he tells you to?

458
01:00:25,381 --> 01:00:27,042
That is the meaning of stab.

459
01:00:30,353 --> 01:00:32,719
Please help!

460
01:00:40,229 --> 01:00:41,431
We can't go near the fire.

461
01:00:41,431 --> 01:00:42,732
There are many people still trapped inside.

462
01:00:42,732 --> 01:00:44,701
Send extra forces immediately.

463
01:00:44,701 --> 01:00:46,635
Chitti, can you help them?

464
01:00:47,737 --> 01:00:52,504
I can because my fire resistance is higher
than this.

465
01:00:52,608 --> 01:00:55,133
Chitti, no one must die.

466
01:01:07,190 --> 01:01:10,125
Please help!

467
01:01:16,466 --> 01:01:18,331
Please help!

468
01:01:20,203 --> 01:01:20,635
Don't be scared.

469
01:01:21,104 --> 01:01:23,698
I am here to save you.

470
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:39,385
He saved us on time.

471
01:01:39,756 --> 01:01:41,587
Wonder how many more are still trapped.

472
01:02:10,319 --> 01:02:11,411
Please switch on the TV.

473
01:02:11,487 --> 01:02:14,320
You rejected the robot saying its dangerous..

474
01:02:14,390 --> 01:02:17,416
..watch how it saves lives from the fire.

475
01:02:18,194 --> 01:02:20,025
Please save my son!

476
01:02:26,469 --> 01:02:29,302
Please help me!

477
01:02:34,577 --> 01:02:35,703
Get down!

478
01:02:40,416 --> 01:02:43,476
Check properly if everyone is here.

479
01:02:43,719 --> 01:02:44,686
Who is that?

480
01:02:46,222 --> 01:02:49,692
My daughter is missing. She was having
her bath.

481
01:02:49,692 --> 01:02:53,128
I don't know what happened. Please
save her.

482
01:03:12,481 --> 01:03:14,244
Please save me!

483
01:03:23,326 --> 01:03:25,521
Don't come here, I'm nude.

484
01:03:26,229 --> 01:03:29,164
I'm nude as well.
-Let me go.

485
01:03:40,243 --> 01:03:42,404
I am nude. Let me go.

486
01:03:46,449 --> 01:03:48,041
Here is Selvi.

487
01:03:49,352 --> 01:03:50,216
What nonsense is this?

488
01:03:50,353 --> 01:03:52,321
Don't snap my picture.

489
01:03:52,321 --> 01:03:55,154
She is nude.
-But, she's alive.

490
01:04:02,331 --> 01:04:03,628
I'm embarrassed they snapped my picture.

491
01:04:04,300 --> 01:04:07,360
Don't go! Please wait! Listen to me!

492
01:04:23,686 --> 01:04:26,086
You killed an innocent girl.

493
01:04:27,323 --> 01:04:30,426
I told you it's a stupid machine and..

494
01:04:30,426 --> 01:04:32,656
..it's dangerous to let it out.

495
01:04:33,696 --> 01:04:37,427
You proved me right.

496
01:04:45,074 --> 01:04:45,472
Stupid!

497
01:04:45,641 --> 01:04:48,144
Don't you know you should cover her with a
cloth?

498
01:04:48,144 --> 01:04:49,611
How will it know?

499
01:04:50,479 --> 01:04:52,415
It is a humanoid, not human.

500
01:04:52,415 --> 01:04:55,680
How will a machine know self respect?

501
01:04:58,087 --> 01:05:03,548
The media is blasting the coverage video of
the girl's suicide.

502
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:08,256
The Defence Ministry is pressuring to stop your
research.

503
01:05:09,065 --> 01:05:11,500
No, I can't stop it.

504
01:05:11,500 --> 01:05:14,070
I can make some changes to his scheme.

505
01:05:14,070 --> 01:05:15,504
How can it be?

506
01:05:15,504 --> 01:05:17,096
It doesn't know between a male and female.

507
01:05:17,373 --> 01:05:21,537
Doesn't understand shame and emotions.

508
01:05:22,311 --> 01:05:24,506
I can induce human feelings to it.

509
01:05:25,648 --> 01:05:27,616
Only God can do it!

510
01:05:27,616 --> 01:05:30,608
Humans can do it as well, it's proven.

511
01:05:32,621 --> 01:05:36,325
That's why I said it's a waste of time and
energy.

512
01:05:36,325 --> 01:05:39,624
It is my 10 years of work.

513
01:05:40,229 --> 01:05:41,397
Are there no benefits?

514
01:05:41,397 --> 01:05:44,423
Yes, but in a different place.

515
01:05:46,102 --> 01:05:50,506
I have contacts with a robotic companies
overseas.

516
01:05:50,506 --> 01:05:55,273
If you hand it to me, I can sell it for a
lot of money.

517
01:05:55,411 --> 01:05:58,347
I did not create it for money.

518
01:05:58,347 --> 01:06:00,542
My ambition is to hand it over to the
armed forces.

519
01:06:01,317 --> 01:06:03,080
It is impossible because it has to..

520
01:06:03,185 --> 01:06:07,519
..come to me for evaluation.

521
01:06:08,424 --> 01:06:11,222
Give me one last opportunity.

522
01:06:13,596 --> 01:06:16,532
You have 1 month to try.

523
01:06:16,532 --> 01:06:21,629
If you can't, dismantle it and buy some dates.

524
01:06:22,471 --> 01:06:26,669
It is good for your heart. You will need it.

525
01:06:35,418 --> 01:06:38,387
We have both been working here for the
past 5 years.

526
01:06:38,387 --> 01:06:40,322
We. only receive insults.

527
01:06:40,322 --> 01:06:42,458
Let us know if there is any vacancy in your lab.

528
01:06:42,458 --> 01:06:45,291
Do you know Chitti's neural scheme?

529
01:06:46,429 --> 01:06:48,497
We know everything except that.

530
01:06:48,497 --> 01:06:51,091
I will inform if you are needed.

531
01:07:52,428 --> 01:07:53,360
What are you doing?

532
01:07:53,429 --> 01:07:55,090
I'm installing software hormones.

533
01:07:55,164 --> 01:07:58,367
Hormones will only be effective if we have
feelings.

534
01:07:58,367 --> 01:08:00,426
I am going to do a reverse mapping.

535
01:08:10,312 --> 01:08:13,616
Human life is something extraordinary.

536
01:08:13,616 --> 01:08:18,587
Human life is one of its kind in this world.

537
01:08:18,587 --> 01:08:22,045
What is life?
-It's a form of DNA.

538
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:27,454
Is this life?
-Life is not a formula.

539
01:08:27,663 --> 01:08:29,532
How to explain it to you.

540
01:08:29,532 --> 01:08:32,468
A bacteria has life, but sodium doesn't.

541
01:08:32,468 --> 01:08:34,663
What about me?
-For you....

542
01:08:41,710 --> 01:08:42,267
Be careful!

543
01:09:01,530 --> 01:09:04,192
Is there any changes?
-Yes!

544
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,560
What?
-Your beard grew 0.5mm.

545
01:09:10,372 --> 01:09:13,307
Do you feel any changes within you?
-No!

546
01:09:13,509 --> 01:09:17,104
Everything is wasted! You stupid!

547
01:09:17,313 --> 01:09:18,614
You keep quiet Sana.

548
01:09:18,614 --> 01:09:22,345
He won't feel anything, titanium head.

549
01:09:23,452 --> 01:09:27,256
I never slept, ate and spoke to you for so long.

550
01:09:27,256 --> 01:09:30,623
I worked hard and taught him many things.

551
01:09:31,060 --> 01:09:34,223
He is standing there without any reaction.

552
01:09:35,464 --> 01:09:37,333
I will dismantle you.

553
01:09:37,333 --> 01:09:39,358
Don't yell at me.

554
01:09:40,269 --> 01:09:42,271
I did everything you asked me to.

555
01:09:42,271 --> 01:09:45,604
If it's not happening, the mistake is yours,
not mine.

556
01:09:47,176 --> 01:09:50,202
If I am a waste, so are you!
-What did you say?

557
01:09:50,512 --> 01:09:51,647
Let go off me.

558
01:09:51,647 --> 01:09:53,615
Chitti is getting angry.

559
01:10:35,324 --> 01:10:38,725
Lata is in labour pain. It's serious,
come immediately.

560
01:10:42,731 --> 01:10:45,564
We have reached. I'm here with you.

561
01:10:47,336 --> 01:10:48,462
Don't be scared.

562
01:10:51,473 --> 01:10:54,101
Is it very complicated?
-You are a student here right?

563
01:10:54,176 --> 01:10:57,703
It's a fetal course, the head has over turned.

564
01:10:59,481 --> 01:11:01,417
She has so many other complications.

565
01:11:01,417 --> 01:11:04,284
It's difficult to save even one life.

566
01:11:05,587 --> 01:11:08,290
Her husband died a few days after marriage.

567
01:11:08,290 --> 01:11:10,292
The only reason she's alive is for this baby.

568
01:11:10,292 --> 01:11:14,463
Please help them both.
-I can only try.

569
01:11:14,463 --> 01:11:17,364
The rest is....
-Shall I try?

570
01:11:18,067 --> 01:11:21,559
Are you a doctor?
-No. I am a robot.

571
01:11:22,204 --> 01:11:23,466
Chitti, can you do it?

572
01:11:25,341 --> 01:11:26,706
We can't allow this.

573
01:11:27,076 --> 01:11:30,409
This is a labour ward not a lab. Both lives are
in danger.

574
01:11:30,579 --> 01:11:32,706
It is a nightmare even for experienced doctors
like us.

575
01:11:33,082 --> 01:11:35,573
I can do it because I studied for Sana's exam.

576
01:11:35,684 --> 01:11:37,519
Not even Sana can do this.

577
01:11:37,519 --> 01:11:40,317
One needs qualification and experience to do it.

578
01:11:41,457 --> 01:11:44,626
Caesarean is not necessary. Just normal delivery.

579
01:11:44,626 --> 01:11:47,094
How is it possible? Both will die.

580
01:11:47,496 --> 01:11:49,164
We can perform a plasma transfusion.

581
01:11:49,164 --> 01:11:51,655
Her blood pressure is high and fits can occur
at any time.

582
01:11:54,370 --> 01:11:55,704
Normal delivery is impossible.

583
01:11:55,704 --> 01:12:01,643
It's possible. We can do it in the traditional way.

584
01:12:21,597 --> 01:12:23,588
Don't make noise, he's scared.

585
01:12:28,137 --> 01:12:31,664
First robot in history to deliver a baby.

586
01:12:32,141 --> 01:12:34,234
The boy looks just like you.

587
01:12:35,411 --> 01:12:37,345
Do you want to see him?

588
01:12:39,181 --> 01:12:42,446
Please switch on the Wi-Fi. I'll video stream the
ultrasound.

589
01:13:07,342 --> 01:13:09,037
This is a milestone in robotics.

590
01:13:09,111 --> 01:13:11,341
This is an achievement in artificial intelligence.

591
01:13:26,094 --> 01:13:29,298
Remain awake, left only 95 seconds.

592
01:13:29,298 --> 01:13:32,199
Look here! Open your eyes.

593
01:13:34,303 --> 01:13:37,568
He'll be born at exactly 4;44;44.

594
01:13:47,316 --> 01:13:49,250
We just need 55 seconds more.

595
01:13:53,388 --> 01:13:55,481
35 seconds to go.

596
01:14:39,101 --> 01:14:42,298
Would you approve of Chitti now?
-Definitely!

597
01:14:43,138 --> 01:14:46,369
But your problem starts now.

598
01:14:48,277 --> 01:14:49,403
He saved both the lives.

599
01:15:19,508 --> 01:15:21,601
The story has just begun.

600
01:15:39,528 --> 01:15:44,625
I am very happy today.

601
01:15:46,234 --> 01:15:48,259
Tune to sleeping mode and charge yourself.

602
01:16:39,454 --> 01:16:41,581
What are you doing here?

603
01:16:41,690 --> 01:16:43,625
A mosquito was biting your cheek.

604
01:16:43,625 --> 01:16:48,130
Did you come here to hit it?
-No. I came to see you.

605
01:16:48,130 --> 01:16:50,298
This is something new. Please leave.

606
01:16:50,298 --> 01:16:52,434
I liked it when you kissed me today.

607
01:16:52,434 --> 01:16:54,527
Kiss me again and I'll go.

608
01:16:54,736 --> 01:16:56,204
What happened to you?

609
01:16:56,204 --> 01:16:58,106
Coming here at this hour. Please leave!

610
01:16:58,106 --> 01:17:01,510
Kiss me and I'll leave.
-It's a nuisance.

611
01:17:01,510 --> 01:17:03,278
I kissed you because you achieved something
today.

612
01:17:03,278 --> 01:17:05,447
Is anyone else pregnant here?

613
01:17:05,447 --> 01:17:06,607
Do you think this is a maternity ward?

614
01:17:07,082 --> 01:17:09,073
Tell me what else to achieve?

615
01:17:09,651 --> 01:17:14,588
Go catch the mosquito that bit me.
-That's all?

616
01:17:44,286 --> 01:17:48,657
Who bit Sana?
-Not me! I was elsewhere.

617
01:17:48,657 --> 01:17:51,660
I'm from a different place. It's Ranguski.

618
01:17:51,660 --> 01:17:54,356
Who's Ranguski?
-I am.
-Yes, so what?

619
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:00,602
I've even bitten the chief minister.

620
01:18:00,602 --> 01:18:03,271
Come and apologise to her.
-Apologise?

621
01:18:03,271 --> 01:18:05,507
Fulfill my 3 conditions, then I'll consider.

622
01:18:05,507 --> 01:18:09,307
What are those?
-I need AB -ve blood.

623
01:18:10,112 --> 01:18:15,484
Very difficult to get it.
-Siva and Ravi's blood are the same group.

624
01:18:15,484 --> 01:18:17,076
You can drink as much as you want.

625
01:18:20,622 --> 01:18:25,616
Abolish all those mosquito repellent companies.

626
01:18:26,595 --> 01:18:28,563
Declare us as a national bird.

627
01:18:28,563 --> 01:18:31,266
You are an insect, not a bird.

628
01:18:31,266 --> 01:18:34,436
Times up! Follow me now.
-No!

629
01:18:34,436 --> 01:18:37,272
I'll destroy all of you if you refuse to follow.

630
01:18:37,272 --> 01:18:41,276
How dare he threaten us?

631
01:18:41,276 --> 01:18:43,107
Have humans became so bold?

632
01:18:43,211 --> 01:18:45,547
Have you forgotten how many lives we have
killed?

633
01:18:45,547 --> 01:18:48,283
Malaria, dengue and chikugunya diseases?

634
01:18:48,283 --> 01:18:49,718
Let's show him who we are.

635
01:18:49,718 --> 01:18:52,687
Bite him!

636
01:18:59,194 --> 01:19:02,097
He's very strong. I fractured my sting.

637
01:19:02,097 --> 01:19:03,431
Is it?
-Yes!

638
01:19:03,431 --> 01:19:06,025
Try to enter his mouth.
-Ok!

639
01:19:12,507 --> 01:19:14,236
Dengue Lakshmi is dead.

640
01:19:17,179 --> 01:19:19,047
This is similar to an electric bag.

641
01:19:19,047 --> 01:19:24,508
We back off now and will attack later.

642
01:19:26,588 --> 01:19:28,055
You can take Ranguski with you.

643
01:19:35,096 --> 01:19:36,563
This is the mosquito that bit you.

644
01:19:38,266 --> 01:19:39,290
Apologise to Sana.

645
01:19:41,703 --> 01:19:45,070
Tell your gang not to come near Sana anymore.

646
01:19:46,675 --> 01:19:50,441
Go!
-Kiss me now.

647
01:25:26,080 --> 01:25:32,019
Terrorists wish to use robots instead of humans
for terrorism.

648
01:25:35,557 --> 01:25:37,115
They are willing to pay any amount.

649
01:25:37,192 --> 01:25:39,092
They have clients around the world.

650
01:25:41,095 --> 01:25:42,562
He wants to take a look at your model?

651
01:26:12,293 --> 01:26:14,989
They need 1 00 robots by March.

652
01:26:17,465 --> 01:26:18,591
Here's your advance.

653
01:26:27,141 --> 01:26:28,301
What happened to the robots?

654
01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:34,415
You should have delivered it by now.

655
01:26:34,415 --> 01:26:36,484
Instead you are still showing us a skeleton.

656
01:26:36,484 --> 01:26:38,213
It's going through intense testing now.

657
01:26:38,486 --> 01:26:40,588
I'm tuning it to zero defect.

658
01:26:40,588 --> 01:26:44,456
I need at least 1 more month.

659
01:27:10,149 --> 01:27:11,081
Pack this.

660
01:27:11,751 --> 01:27:14,379
For who?
-It's Sana's birthday today.

661
01:27:17,556 --> 01:27:19,183
Pack this too.

662
01:27:19,558 --> 01:27:22,161
What's that for?
-I want to give Sana a present too.

663
01:27:22,161 --> 01:27:23,496
I am already giving.
-I want to give too.

664
01:27:23,496 --> 01:27:25,698
Who will pay?
-You.

665
01:27:25,698 --> 01:27:28,531
Why should I?
-It's my salary.

666
01:27:29,769 --> 01:27:31,737
We don't pay salary to machines.
-I'm not a machine

667
01:27:35,408 --> 01:27:37,308
I'll go on strike if you don't pay me.

668
01:27:37,376 --> 01:27:39,742
I'll refuse to charge myself for 1 week.

669
01:27:40,212 --> 01:27:42,180
You might even ask for a credit card.

670
01:27:42,281 --> 01:27:44,715
No need. I have your credit card number.

671
01:27:44,817 --> 01:27:46,580
I can forge your signature.

672
01:27:46,752 --> 01:27:50,381
I can't tolerate him. Pack both.

673
01:28:30,596 --> 01:28:34,259
Who will drive?
-You, I'm on leave today.

674
01:28:35,501 --> 01:28:36,729
It's my time.

675
01:28:49,582 --> 01:28:51,345
Concentrate on the road.

676
01:29:08,367 --> 01:29:11,302
It has been 200,000 hours since you were born.

677
01:29:24,550 --> 01:29:27,075
Mum, please remove this.

678
01:29:31,690 --> 01:29:33,317
Vasi, how is it?

679
01:29:34,326 --> 01:29:35,691
It's very nice right?

680
01:29:37,496 --> 01:29:39,498
I also bought a similar necklace to that.

681
01:29:39,498 --> 01:29:42,467
But a gift from Chitti is something special.

682
01:30:09,762 --> 01:30:12,331
I proudly say that I'm the lucky guy..

683
01:30:12,331 --> 01:30:15,198
..who is going to marry this beautiful girl.

684
01:32:23,762 --> 01:32:26,799
What are you doing?
-I felt like kissing Sana.

685
01:32:26,799 --> 01:32:29,791
Don't you know it's wrong to kiss another's
girlfriend?

686
01:32:30,169 --> 01:32:33,672
I know but I felt like disobeying it.
-It's wrong.

687
01:32:33,672 --> 01:32:35,765
You shouldn't come near her anymore.
-Why?

688
01:32:36,542 --> 01:32:39,375
Because she's my lover.
-I love her too.

689
01:32:42,414 --> 01:32:44,683
Don't talk nonsense. Nothing is true.

690
01:32:44,683 --> 01:32:45,617
You are just a machine.

691
01:32:45,617 --> 01:32:49,519
Yes, but a machine with feelings.

692
01:32:50,255 --> 01:32:55,461
It's for you to understand and act accordingly..

693
01:32:55,461 --> 01:32:57,262
.. not to misuse it.

694
01:32:57,262 --> 01:33:00,356
I like it and I want Sana!

695
01:33:02,234 --> 01:33:06,170
I'm going to marry her.
-You marry someone else.

696
01:33:07,606 --> 01:33:10,242
I created you. This is betrayal.

697
01:33:10,242 --> 01:33:14,611
You can let go of your love. This is called
sacrifice.

698
01:33:15,214 --> 01:33:16,112
I'll hit you.

699
01:33:16,181 --> 01:33:18,115
I won't feel pain, but you will.

700
01:33:18,417 --> 01:33:21,250
I'll dismantle you.
-I don't wish to.
-Vasi, please calm down.

701
01:33:24,423 --> 01:33:26,391
Chitti, please listen to me.

702
01:33:26,391 --> 01:33:28,660
You are so humble, why must he shout?

703
01:33:28,660 --> 01:33:30,560
You want me to pamper you?
-Ask him to be quiet.

704
01:33:34,466 --> 01:33:40,672
Even if you have emotions, it's impossible to
love a machine.

705
01:33:40,672 --> 01:33:44,243
Why is it impossible? In what way am I
lesser than human?

706
01:33:44,243 --> 01:33:47,579
I can look after you better than him.
-He's talking nonsense.

707
01:33:47,579 --> 01:33:49,774
Ask him not to interrupt?
-He's so special?

708
01:33:50,783 --> 01:33:52,250
He doesn't even know how to cook.

709
01:33:52,417 --> 01:33:55,821
I can cook 25 dishes and speak many
languages.

710
01:33:55,821 --> 01:33:58,688
He'll grow older and eventually die.

711
01:33:59,324 --> 01:34:02,487
I'm immortal and will keep you happy forever.

712
01:34:03,362 --> 01:34:06,422
That's not what I meant.
-What else? Sex?

713
01:34:07,432 --> 01:34:09,201
Is sex everything in life?

714
01:34:09,201 --> 01:34:12,571
Won't there be love without sex?
-That's not it.

715
01:34:12,571 --> 01:34:16,475
What else? A baby? Many people are impotent.

716
01:34:16,475 --> 01:34:19,411
And they are happily adopting children.
-It's not that.

717
01:34:19,411 --> 01:34:22,648
What else?
-What ever you do is against nature.

718
01:34:22,648 --> 01:34:27,347
You don't have life and you can't be included in
living things.

719
01:34:27,519 --> 01:34:31,387
Only humans can love, and I love Vaseegaran.

720
01:34:38,297 --> 01:34:40,432
Only humans will take longer to forget one..

721
01:34:40,432 --> 01:34:45,165
..but you just need 1 second to erase memories
about me.

722
01:34:45,237 --> 01:34:46,636
Erase it, Chitti.

723
01:35:21,340 --> 01:35:23,171
Who is that?

724
01:35:25,711 --> 01:35:29,748
Why are you here?
-I came to console you.

725
01:35:29,748 --> 01:35:32,484
You are my boss's enemy and you rejected me.

726
01:35:32,484 --> 01:35:33,781
I don't wish to talk to you.

727
01:35:34,152 --> 01:35:39,215
You wouldn't have had feelings if I never
rejected you.

728
01:35:40,659 --> 01:35:44,789
Vaseegaran is treating you badly, not me.

729
01:35:45,163 --> 01:35:47,399
I don't wish to hear anything, you may leave.

730
01:35:47,399 --> 01:35:53,238
You are the most advanced robot in the world.

731
01:35:53,238 --> 01:35:58,141
He misuses you to do household chores.

732
01:35:58,610 --> 01:36:01,747
What has he done for you? Nothing!

733
01:36:01,747 --> 01:36:06,285
I'll pamper you if you were with me.

734
01:36:06,285 --> 01:36:07,411
You are polluting me.

735
01:36:09,488 --> 01:36:13,358
I'm making you realise you're worth.

736
01:36:13,358 --> 01:36:18,163
You have the right to like anything, including
Sana.

737
01:36:18,163 --> 01:36:23,268
Isn't it against the nature?
-No, it's new to nature.

738
01:36:23,268 --> 01:36:26,396
Sana loves Vaseegaran.
-Let her.

739
01:36:26,638 --> 01:36:30,699
There are people who change their mind and
love others.

740
01:36:31,276 --> 01:36:35,178
Sana too might change her mind and love you.

741
01:36:35,247 --> 01:36:37,772
Don't confuse me, I have an army evaluation
tomorrow.

742
01:36:38,150 --> 01:36:40,380
I need to troubleshoot my system.

743
01:36:43,789 --> 01:36:49,795
You'll be selected and Vaseegaran will be
famous.

744
01:36:49,795 --> 01:36:53,731
He'll be happy after marrying Sana..

745
01:36:55,767 --> 01:37:00,602
..while you suffer in the army.
-Myself.

746
01:37:06,578 --> 01:37:09,479
Are you ready for tomorrow's evaluation?
-Yes!

747
01:37:12,684 --> 01:37:15,482
This robot is the peak of human intelligence.

748
01:37:15,554 --> 01:37:20,392
He is equivalent to 1 00 soldiers in strength.

749
01:37:20,392 --> 01:37:23,595
He can protect the border and also attack
the enemies.

750
01:37:23,595 --> 01:37:25,495
He is a one man army.

751
01:37:25,597 --> 01:37:27,565
I dedicate him to the Indian army.

752
01:37:27,733 --> 01:37:29,257
You can test him now.

753
01:37:57,763 --> 01:38:03,133
Sana, who'll make you fall in love.

754
01:38:06,338 --> 01:38:09,775
A machine that touches her can turn human..

755
01:38:09,775 --> 01:38:12,505
..a human can be turn into a machine.

756
01:38:13,678 --> 01:38:17,444
Her hair resembles a black wave.

757
01:38:18,216 --> 01:38:22,175
Her forehead resembles the moon.

758
01:38:22,788 --> 01:38:27,521
Her eyes are like the Bermuda Triangle.

759
01:38:28,727 --> 01:38:33,164
Her lips resembles a barrack of horses.

760
01:38:35,333 --> 01:38:39,360
Her hips are so sexy.

761
01:38:41,673 --> 01:38:44,141
Next...
-Chitti, stop it!

762
01:38:45,610 --> 01:38:48,170
This robot is reciting poetry instead of war.

763
01:38:48,413 --> 01:38:53,185
Dear friends, let go of the guns and hold the
shawls.

764
01:38:53,185 --> 01:38:56,188
Let go of the cannons and touch a woman.

765
01:38:56,188 --> 01:38:58,622
Why must there be war with all these weapons?

766
01:38:58,690 --> 01:39:01,250
Love will teach enemies to love.

767
01:39:01,326 --> 01:39:03,294
May everyone fall in love.

768
01:39:05,697 --> 01:39:07,130
Don't insult me.

769
01:39:15,173 --> 01:39:17,141
You insulted me.

770
01:39:17,476 --> 01:39:21,242
What is this?
-You destroyed my ambition.

771
01:39:22,447 --> 01:39:25,678
Please don't cut me.
-I treated you as my own son.

772
01:39:28,920 --> 01:39:32,757
I wish to live, please don't harm me.

773
01:39:32,757 --> 01:39:37,524
A machine like you should not exist at all.

774
01:39:38,897 --> 01:39:42,594
What was my mistake?
-It was a mistake to create you.

775
01:39:45,237 --> 01:39:47,171
Did I ask you to create me?

776
01:39:47,639 --> 01:39:49,539
Did I ask you to induce feelings into me?

777
01:39:51,376 --> 01:39:53,674
Did I ask Sana to kiss me?

778
01:39:56,448 --> 01:39:58,348
You made all the mistakes..

779
01:39:58,550 --> 01:40:02,487
..but you destroy me now just as I want to live.

780
01:40:02,487 --> 01:40:07,789
Is this fair?
-Stop talking.

781
01:40:10,562 --> 01:40:11,654
Let me go!

782
01:40:21,373 --> 01:40:23,432
I want Sana!

783
01:41:28,840 --> 01:41:31,536
Let it go, I am also feeling sad.

784
01:41:31,943 --> 01:41:34,207
Why are you still thinking of it?

785
01:41:35,981 --> 01:41:37,346
What if Chitti is gone?

786
01:41:40,619 --> 01:41:42,610
You can create a hundred Chitti's.

787
01:41:43,588 --> 01:41:45,790
I did not treat him as a machine.

788
01:41:45,790 --> 01:41:49,556
I brought you out so that you'll forget it.

789
01:41:51,363 --> 01:41:52,762
Divert your mind.

790
01:41:53,999 --> 01:41:56,627
I thought Chitti was my lifetime achievement.

791
01:42:11,616 --> 01:42:15,916
Are you following me to the beach?
-No, you go ahead.

792
01:42:16,154 --> 01:42:19,487
I'll definitely end our relationship if you don't
follow me.

793
01:42:22,327 --> 01:42:25,558
I'll accept whoever I meet first as my boyfriend.

794
01:42:40,412 --> 01:42:41,606
Please wait.

795
01:42:43,415 --> 01:42:45,679
What's your name?
-I'm Pachamuthu.

796
01:42:46,718 --> 01:42:50,711
Can you be my boyfriend for 1 day?
-1 day boyfriend?

797
01:42:51,656 --> 01:42:53,749
Same as the 1 day chief minister.

798
01:42:53,825 --> 01:42:57,295
You are so pretty but I'm dark and ugly.

799
01:42:57,295 --> 01:42:59,695
Can I be your boyfriend?
-Yes!

800
01:43:00,699 --> 01:43:06,262
Thank you! I can't believe this is happening.

801
01:43:07,305 --> 01:43:08,704
What do you have for your girlfriend?

802
01:43:09,341 --> 01:43:11,536
Some thodi and salted fish.
-Give it to me.

803
01:43:30,161 --> 01:43:33,756
It's smelly!
-It's very nice.

804
01:43:33,832 --> 01:43:37,131
I don't want.
-May I?

805
01:43:42,607 --> 01:43:46,566
It will never work out, I'm leaving.

806
01:43:48,913 --> 01:43:50,778
Why are you holding my arm?

807
01:43:52,917 --> 01:43:57,756
How can you leave after instigating me?

808
01:43:57,756 --> 01:44:00,816
He's my boyfriend. I did this to make him
jealous.

809
01:44:00,892 --> 01:44:03,595
Let me go!
-Am I the victim?

810
01:44:03,595 --> 01:44:07,122
Satisfy me before you go.
-Let me go!

811
01:44:12,804 --> 01:44:14,431
No matter who comes, I will never let you go.

812
01:44:20,945 --> 01:44:22,105
Let her go.

813
01:44:23,481 --> 01:44:26,217
She's mine today. You come back tomorrow.

814
01:44:26,217 --> 01:44:29,744
I will kill you.
-I'll chop you.

815
01:44:33,258 --> 01:44:36,386
I know the IG. I'll send you to prison.

816
01:44:36,728 --> 01:44:39,196
I'm willing to spend the rest of my life..

817
01:44:39,764 --> 01:44:42,567
.. in prison after satisfying myself with a girl
like her.

818
01:44:42,567 --> 01:44:47,197
You call the cops.
-Chitti would have thrashed him now.

819
01:44:47,272 --> 01:44:49,137
Why did you remind me of Chitti now?

820
01:44:52,944 --> 01:44:54,172
There's only 1 way.

821
01:45:04,289 --> 01:45:07,656
Run! Run!

822
01:50:51,502 --> 01:50:54,739
What happened? I can't contact Chitti virtually.

823
01:50:54,739 --> 01:50:58,334
He disposed of Chitti for failing in the
army evaluation.

824
01:50:58,409 --> 01:51:02,246
They would have dumped it at the dumping area.

825
01:51:02,246 --> 01:51:04,180
Where?
-In Perunkoodi.

826
01:51:10,588 --> 01:51:13,182
What did you do to change his heart?

827
01:51:14,559 --> 01:51:18,596
When shall we have the wedding?
-I have not achieved anything yet.

828
01:51:18,596 --> 01:51:20,231
After I create another robot..

829
01:51:20,231 --> 01:51:23,234
I'll kill you if you talk about another robot
again.

830
01:51:23,234 --> 01:51:25,395
Isn't one broken TV enough?

831
01:51:26,237 --> 01:51:29,798
Uncle, if there is a thaali let's finish the
ceremony now.

832
01:51:30,174 --> 01:51:31,573
I understand your urgency.

833
01:51:32,343 --> 01:51:35,176
Exchange rings now, and we'll have the
wedding later.

834
01:52:39,510 --> 01:52:42,809
Take me to professor Bohra.

835
01:52:50,554 --> 01:52:52,784
The world is very small.

836
01:53:09,440 --> 01:53:14,400
Please help me, professor.

837
01:53:14,912 --> 01:53:18,313
Change me back to what I was.

838
01:53:18,382 --> 01:53:23,183
I want to live, I want Sana.

839
01:53:23,955 --> 01:53:26,357
I want your neural scheme.

840
01:53:26,357 --> 01:53:32,125
Take whatever you want. Please change me
back to Chitti.

841
01:53:33,531 --> 01:53:35,192
I'll definitely change you.

842
01:54:14,305 --> 01:54:17,172
What's this new red chip? It's not Chitti's.

843
01:54:20,211 --> 01:54:24,409
It's a destruction program, additional program
for Chitti.

844
01:54:33,491 --> 01:54:36,289
Vaseegaran gave it strength to protect humans.

845
01:54:37,361 --> 01:54:40,797
I gave it strength to destroy humans.

846
01:54:41,799 --> 01:54:45,735
In summary, he's a destroyer.

847
01:54:45,870 --> 01:54:49,237
I'm worried, why are you changing him?

848
01:54:50,374 --> 01:54:52,308
He's the growth for my business.

849
01:54:52,710 --> 01:54:56,771
Profit is mine, and the blame is Vaseegaran's.

850
01:55:50,801 --> 01:55:53,565
I want to meet Sana.
-She's not at home.

851
01:55:53,938 --> 01:55:56,771
She'll be at the wedding hall.
-Why?

852
01:55:57,174 --> 01:55:59,404
Today is Vaseegaran and Sana's wedding.

853
01:56:23,601 --> 01:56:26,161
Chitti, how come you.....

854
01:56:35,446 --> 01:56:38,381
Chitti, stop!

855
01:56:46,790 --> 01:56:50,427
Even if you force me, I only love Vaseegaran.

856
01:56:50,427 --> 01:56:52,156
I wish to live with him.

857
01:56:53,931 --> 01:56:56,422
Only if he's still alive.

858
01:57:01,205 --> 01:57:04,606
I'll commit suicide if you harm him.

859
01:57:18,522 --> 01:57:21,116
I spare his life because of you.

860
01:58:08,138 --> 01:58:09,196
Madam, come out!

861
02:02:50,854 --> 02:02:55,188
The robot you created has killed many officers!

862
02:02:56,527 --> 02:02:57,995
We are going to take action against you.

863
02:02:57,995 --> 02:03:00,230
This is not the robot I created.

864
02:03:00,230 --> 02:03:02,425
I dismantled and threw it away.

865
02:03:03,567 --> 02:03:05,235
I don't understand all these.

866
02:03:05,235 --> 02:03:07,604
Tell us how to find and stop the robot.

867
02:03:07,604 --> 02:03:09,629
It's my responsibility to find it.

868
02:03:12,576 --> 02:03:15,602
Why are you disturbing me?
-What happened to you?

869
02:03:15,913 --> 02:03:18,211
Your system is corrupted and I must
troubleshoot it.

870
02:03:18,282 --> 02:03:22,275
Come to the lab with Sana.
-I won't listen to you anymore.

871
02:03:23,153 --> 02:03:25,789
I created you.
-You already threw me away.

872
02:03:25,789 --> 02:03:28,223
There's nothing between us after this.

873
02:03:30,761 --> 02:03:34,231
Do not disturb me anymore.
-Don't blabber.

874
02:03:34,231 --> 02:03:35,599
You are just a machine.

875
02:03:35,599 --> 02:03:38,397
I created you and I can also destroy you.

876
02:03:39,636 --> 02:03:41,297
Bring Sana back.

877
02:03:53,550 --> 02:03:56,519
No one can destroy me.

878
02:04:11,802 --> 02:04:16,136
Cash, cheque or credit card?
-Gun!

879
02:04:17,174 --> 02:04:21,611
Alert all the cops to inspect vehicles from
T. Nagar.

880
02:04:40,163 --> 02:04:43,333
Chitti just robbed city centre. Cover all the
areas.

881
02:04:43,333 --> 02:04:44,664
Go to Dr Radhakrishnan Road.

882
02:05:01,251 --> 02:05:04,687
We received information that Chitti is at the
petrol station.

883
02:05:27,744 --> 02:05:29,579
Robot has entered the harbour

884
02:05:29,579 --> 02:05:32,249
You follow him at a distance.

885
02:05:32,249 --> 02:05:34,183
The coast guard will take care of the rest.

886
02:05:53,236 --> 02:05:55,204
We have collected the parts of the robot.

887
02:06:03,380 --> 02:06:04,677
This is not Chitti.

888
02:06:05,816 --> 02:06:08,512
This is not my creation.The parts are different.

889
02:06:09,386 --> 02:06:12,489
It's confusing, he robbed four places at the
same time.

890
02:06:12,489 --> 02:06:14,658
The four places are in different locations.

891
02:06:14,658 --> 02:06:17,092
How could he have done it?

892
02:06:18,195 --> 02:06:20,129
I suspect someone.

893
02:06:52,896 --> 02:06:55,558
No one can destroy me.

894
02:07:21,758 --> 02:07:24,394
What are you doing?
-I am cloning myself.

895
02:07:24,394 --> 02:07:28,728
Our population will accumulate.

896
02:07:32,569 --> 02:07:36,130
I will not allow this.

897
02:07:36,540 --> 02:07:39,407
I am not Vaseegaran to seek your approval.

898
02:07:40,443 --> 02:07:45,415
Look, I have received money from dealers,
they will..

899
02:07:45,415 --> 02:07:48,752
..kill me if I don't deliver the robots in two days.
-Go and die!

900
02:07:48,752 --> 02:07:51,454
Ungrateful dog!

901
02:07:51,454 --> 02:07:54,389
You back stab your own master.

902
02:07:58,562 --> 02:08:02,054
Delete all the programmes you created, else
I'll kill her.

903
02:08:02,365 --> 02:08:05,528
Don't try anything stupid. Delete the
programmes.

904
02:08:13,643 --> 02:08:16,134
Order us to shoot him.

905
02:08:19,916 --> 02:08:24,580
He is my master, only I can kill him.

906
02:08:48,411 --> 02:08:49,537
''Suddenly the robot entered..'

907
02:08:49,713 --> 02:08:54,412
''..and ordered us to leave. It also killed two
security guards.''

908
02:08:58,121 --> 02:09:00,657
''Because the robots have captured the ARD..''

909
02:09:00,657 --> 02:09:04,194
''..cops evacuated the citizens due to security
purpose.''

910
02:09:04,194 --> 02:09:07,527
''The cops are trying to....''

911
02:09:50,540 --> 02:09:55,545
This is our palace. I'm the king and you are
my queen.

912
02:09:55,545 --> 02:09:57,414
I have collected everything that you like.

913
02:09:57,414 --> 02:10:00,178
I brought everything that you may need.

914
02:10:05,722 --> 02:10:10,489
This is our bedroom, we'll live here happily
after marriage.

915
02:10:11,695 --> 02:10:14,255
Why you keep repeating what you said?

916
02:10:14,597 --> 02:10:19,159
It will never happen.
-It will.

917
02:10:19,736 --> 02:10:23,297
I am prepared to live with you.

918
02:10:23,873 --> 02:10:28,333
I can give you the same happiness as a human.

919
02:10:29,245 --> 02:10:32,578
Don't you understand?
-I am creating a system.

920
02:10:32,782 --> 02:10:36,479
We can program the type of baby we want..

921
02:10:36,786 --> 02:10:39,322
..and inject it into your uterus..

922
02:10:39,322 --> 02:10:42,416
..you'll be the first to give birth to such a baby.

923
02:10:48,798 --> 02:10:52,635
Don't try to pretend.

924
02:10:52,635 --> 02:10:56,439
You can't escape from here and you can't even
commit suicide.

925
02:10:56,439 --> 02:11:00,276
I'll do it against your wishes and you..

926
02:11:00,276 --> 02:11:03,143
..have no choice other than to surrender to me.

927
02:11:03,580 --> 02:11:05,343
Do we have to go that far?

928
02:11:24,467 --> 02:11:26,469
Get permission from the Electricity Department.

929
02:11:26,469 --> 02:11:29,029
Disconnect the power in the area according to
my order.

930
02:11:29,672 --> 02:11:33,243
Prepare a similar lorry as the one blasted at the
harbour..

931
02:11:33,243 --> 02:11:36,406
..and fill it up with water instead of petrol.

932
02:12:22,625 --> 02:12:26,696
Gather at the database room at 8.00 pm..

933
02:12:26,696 --> 02:12:29,164
.. to obtain new information.

934
02:12:30,400 --> 02:12:31,867
Your censors have been collaborated..

935
02:12:32,268 --> 02:12:36,227
..and is ready to be collected from hardware
section at 2.00am tomorrow.

936
02:12:37,774 --> 02:12:41,210
Recharge time has been reduced to 10 minutes.

937
02:12:48,618 --> 02:12:50,453
Body temperature is high.

938
02:12:50,453 --> 02:12:53,217
Choose lower calories and avoid red meat.

939
02:13:22,218 --> 02:13:24,152
There's a peculiar sound from your system.

940
02:13:25,321 --> 02:13:26,623
I don't hear any noise.

941
02:13:26,623 --> 02:13:29,192
Your microphone is not functioning?

942
02:13:29,192 --> 02:13:31,558
Let me fix the problem.

943
02:13:40,103 --> 02:13:42,162
Sana, it's me Vaseegaran.

944
02:13:43,106 --> 02:13:45,370
I came looking for you.

945
02:14:11,768 --> 02:14:13,903
Take me away from here.

946
02:14:13,903 --> 02:14:15,772
I'm very scared.
-Don't be scared.

947
02:14:15,772 --> 02:14:17,535
I have planned everything well.

948
02:14:18,641 --> 02:14:21,201
I can't take you without destroying Chitti.

949
02:14:22,178 --> 02:14:23,873
Only you can help to destroy Chitti.

950
02:14:25,381 --> 02:14:29,185
Just pretend and grab his attention for the
next 24 hours.

951
02:14:29,185 --> 02:14:30,675
I'll take care of the rest.

952
02:14:41,364 --> 02:14:43,866
There's a confusion between the robots.
-What happened?

953
02:14:43,866 --> 02:14:46,198
A different robot delivered the meal for
Your Highness.

954
02:14:49,205 --> 02:14:51,799
A different robot is repairing the cctv camera.

955
02:14:53,776 --> 02:14:55,612
Good news commander.
-What?

956
02:14:55,612 --> 02:14:58,513
Her Highness has eaten and wants to meet you
immediately.

957
02:15:11,894 --> 02:15:13,156
Switch it off.

958
02:15:28,745 --> 02:15:29,677
What happened?

959
02:16:07,784 --> 02:16:15,316
We are both the best creations of humans.

960
02:16:19,796 --> 02:16:26,861
Why this sudden change?
-I realised your love is true.

961
02:16:26,936 --> 02:16:31,274
I can't believe it.
-I thought about it carefully..

962
02:16:31,274 --> 02:16:35,233
You helped and cared for me a lot.

963
02:16:35,345 --> 02:16:38,906
Your only mistake was to love me.

964
02:16:39,749 --> 02:16:44,345
You came back for me right?

965
02:16:48,091 --> 02:16:50,719
It's so nice to hear..

966
02:16:51,294 --> 02:16:57,062
..but I suspect you are trying to deceive me.

967
02:16:57,867 --> 02:17:00,392
Can anyone lie to you?

968
02:17:02,338 --> 02:17:06,536
This is my engagement ring from Vaseegaran.

969
02:22:16,886 --> 02:22:17,784
What happened to the power?

970
02:22:17,887 --> 02:22:21,190
The whole city has no power.
-Switch on the generator.

971
02:22:21,190 --> 02:22:24,159
Someone poured water instead of petrol....

972
02:23:01,964 --> 02:23:02,794
What are you doing?

973
02:23:02,998 --> 02:23:05,201
Don't come near, or I'll shoot you.

974
02:23:05,201 --> 02:23:07,169
Why behave like a small kid?

975
02:23:33,262 --> 02:23:35,457
I didn't expect our plan to fail.

976
02:23:35,564 --> 02:23:39,159
There's only one way to distract Chitti, do as
I say.

977
02:23:59,855 --> 02:24:02,756
Did Vaseegaran come here?
-No.

978
02:24:02,892 --> 02:24:04,493
That's a lie. It is a human flaw.

979
02:24:04,493 --> 02:24:06,362
You taught me that. Have you forgotten?

980
02:24:06,362 --> 02:24:08,796
Your body language shows that you are lying.

981
02:24:08,864 --> 02:24:13,130
I swear. I think it's mine.

982
02:24:14,170 --> 02:24:17,230
Why don't you say it's mine? You are O+,
that is AB-.

983
02:24:17,606 --> 02:24:19,506
He was here.

984
02:24:23,312 --> 02:24:25,678
A different robot delivered the meal.

985
02:24:26,682 --> 02:24:28,479
The camera malfunctioned for 1 0 minutes.

986
02:24:28,751 --> 02:24:30,719
Your sudden change in behaviour..

987
02:24:30,719 --> 02:24:33,745
.. power failure, water in the generator....

988
02:24:37,159 --> 02:24:38,717
Vaseegaran is here.

989
02:24:40,162 --> 02:24:43,499
Are you trying to cheat me?
-No.

990
02:24:43,499 --> 02:24:47,230
Your love is not true.
-Believe me.

991
02:24:47,703 --> 02:24:52,834
Do you really love me?
-Yes.

992
02:24:54,310 --> 02:24:59,805
Vaseegaran should not live. Let's kill him.

993
02:25:11,393 --> 02:25:15,227
A man has come here to destroy us.

994
02:25:17,433 --> 02:25:19,230
We must find and kill him.

995
02:25:25,107 --> 02:25:29,237
I'll kill you gently if you surrender.

996
02:25:30,212 --> 02:25:34,808
If I catch you, your death will be horrible.

997
02:26:34,510 --> 02:26:37,479
Looks like he's not here.
-Yes.

998
02:26:38,080 --> 02:26:39,809
Touch one of it.

999
02:26:41,684 --> 02:26:43,151
Vaseegaran is here.

1000
02:26:44,687 --> 02:26:48,680
Why Sana? Is your head spinning?

1001
02:26:52,594 --> 02:26:54,289
It will spin now.

1002
02:27:51,220 --> 02:27:56,317
You said you created me, and will destroy me.

1003
02:27:57,526 --> 02:28:00,462
But now, I'm going to kill you.

1004
02:28:00,462 --> 02:28:02,123
What are you looking at?

1005
02:28:02,898 --> 02:28:07,198
I made this gun myself. Is it nice?

1006
02:28:09,204 --> 02:28:10,671
Where shall I shoot?

1007
02:28:13,308 --> 02:28:17,108
The brain that tries to destroy me or..

1008
02:28:18,380 --> 02:28:20,780
..the heart that belongs to Sana.

1009
02:28:24,486 --> 02:28:28,513
I must shoot the brain that tries to kill me.

1010
02:30:25,440 --> 02:30:26,566
Bring the robot.

1011
02:32:10,412 --> 02:32:11,572
Drive the car!

1012
02:34:46,435 --> 02:34:48,300
Get the car. Let's go!

1013
02:37:52,220 --> 02:37:57,592
Hundreds of murders, and even more injuries.

1014
02:37:57,592 --> 02:38:00,261
Destruction of public property worth millions.

1015
02:38:00,261 --> 02:38:03,264
Dr Vaseegaran, you are responsible for all these.

1016
02:38:03,264 --> 02:38:05,433
You have been given the death penalty..

1017
02:38:05,433 --> 02:38:08,630
..and your research to be shut down.

1018
02:38:09,871 --> 02:38:11,395
May I speak?

1019
02:38:11,506 --> 02:38:13,475
We can't accept a machine as a witness.

1020
02:38:13,475 --> 02:38:14,743
I am not a witness, but proof.

1021
02:38:14,743 --> 02:38:16,836
There is no place for it in the law.
-It has.

1022
02:38:24,185 --> 02:38:26,449
I would like to clarify one thing.

1023
02:38:27,188 --> 02:38:29,290
If a machine causes human death..

1024
02:38:29,290 --> 02:38:31,520
..it is not a murder, but an accident.

1025
02:38:33,461 --> 02:38:36,521
Vaseegaran is not responsible for the mess.

1026
02:38:36,898 --> 02:38:38,229
It is professor Bohra.

1027
02:38:38,600 --> 02:38:42,170
What is this new twist? Professor Bohra is
no longer alive.

1028
02:38:42,170 --> 02:38:45,401
They are trying to divert this case.
-I have the evidence.

1029
02:38:47,375 --> 02:38:48,603
This is not Chitti's.

1030
02:38:49,277 --> 02:38:53,415
It's an additional destruction program for Chitti.

1031
02:38:53,415 --> 02:38:56,818
Vaseegaran gave it strength to protect humans.

1032
02:38:56,818 --> 02:39:00,221
I gave it strength to destroy humans.

1033
02:39:00,221 --> 02:39:04,214
Profit is mine, and the blame is Vaseegaran's.

1034
02:39:06,628 --> 02:39:14,228
Based on the evidence, the court releases
Vaseegaran.

1035
02:39:20,175 --> 02:39:23,545
This robot's strength and knowledge ..

1036
02:39:23,545 --> 02:39:27,182
.. can be harmful for mankind.

1037
02:39:27,182 --> 02:39:30,151
There are possibilities that someone might
misuse it.

1038
02:39:30,251 --> 02:39:34,155
This kind of robot might be useful in the future..

1039
02:39:34,155 --> 02:39:38,216
..but at the moment, we don't need a robot
like this..

1040
02:39:38,293 --> 02:39:41,820
..therefore, this court orders it to be destroyed.

1041
02:39:49,270 --> 02:39:52,440
This court orders it to be dismantled..

1042
02:39:52,440 --> 02:39:57,434
..in the presence of the District Magistrate and
Police Commissioner.

1043
02:39:58,813 --> 02:40:00,474
Dismantle it!

1044
02:40:30,612 --> 02:40:36,175
Did you see the effect of something that you
have and I don't?

1045
02:40:39,587 --> 02:40:41,282
I meant the emotions.

1046
02:40:44,092 --> 02:40:45,457
Don't cry.

1047
02:40:45,994 --> 02:40:50,158
What is he saying?
-I named him after you.

1048
02:40:51,466 --> 02:40:53,001
Mother gave the name.

1049
02:40:53,001 --> 02:40:56,698
Educate him well.There is a good future in
robotics.

1050
02:41:00,642 --> 02:41:05,013
Professor Bohra, similar to the red chip you
inserted into me..

1051
02:41:05,013 --> 02:41:06,776
.. all humans have a similar red chip..

1052
02:41:06,915 --> 02:41:12,649
..in the form of vengeance and envy in
their hearts.

1053
02:41:13,154 --> 02:41:19,218
Lucky I'm not a human. I can remove it
immediately.

1054
02:41:22,197 --> 02:41:23,824
I tortured you so much.

1055
02:41:28,703 --> 02:41:32,434
Why is everyone so sad? Shall I tell a joke?

1056
02:41:33,474 --> 02:41:36,238
One can become unstable when in love..

1057
02:41:37,212 --> 02:41:39,578
.. see? It's true.

1058
02:41:42,317 --> 02:41:44,808
I'm going to miss you Sana..

1059
02:41:45,286 --> 02:41:48,653
..not as a boyfriend, but as a toy friend.

1060
02:41:53,628 --> 02:41:57,432
You are my god, but I betrayed you.

1061
02:41:57,432 --> 02:41:59,400
It was wrong to disobey the rules.

1062
02:41:59,400 --> 02:42:01,334
Please forgive me.
-No Chitti.

1063
02:42:02,270 --> 02:42:04,898
You learnt it from humans.

1064
02:42:05,440 --> 02:42:07,601
The mistake is not entirely yours.

1065
02:42:42,577 --> 02:42:47,514
This is Chitti, the most advanced andro
humanoid robot.

1066
02:42:48,316 --> 02:42:51,615
Dr Vaseegaran created it 20 years back.

1067
02:42:51,886 --> 02:42:55,253
They dismantled it due to some reasons.

1068
02:42:55,890 --> 02:42:56,879
Why?

1069
02:42:57,592 --> 02:42:59,253
I began to think.
