<i>[Ethan] So we met at</i> a <i>party,
and it was magic.</i>

2
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,565
<i>Within a half hour,</i>

3
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,246
<i>we were driving up into
this really nice neighborhood,</i>

4
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,201
<i>and we were
running down the stairs</i>

5
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,328
<i>of some stranger's backyard,</i>

6
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:41,363
<i>and then we were swimming
and we were in Jove.</i>

7
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:44,720
<i>What we didn't count on</i>

8
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,245
<i>was that even though
the lights were off,</i>

9
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,971
<i>the owner of the home
was there,</i>

10
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,122
<i>and he came out
screaming at us,</i>

11
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,282
<i>and it was the greatest
night of my life.</i>

12
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,600
[Whispers] Ready?

13
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:58,165
So my idea was, you know,

14
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:02,370
let's try
and re-create that moment.

15
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,731
[whispers] Oh, it's freezing!

16
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,889
It's a little colder
than I remember it.

17
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,360
[heavy breathing]

18
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,811
Do you think
he's coming out?

19
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,645
I'm sure. I'm sure he
heard us, right?

20
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,122
Hello? This is fun.

21
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,321
Yeah.

22
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,601
Where is he?

23
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,725
[whispers] Maybe he's not home.

24
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,203
Happy anniversary anyway.

25
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,884
Happy anniversary.

26
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,727
<i>[Sophie] When we were in the
water and we were waiting</i>

27
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,531
<i>and no one came out,
no one was home,</i>

28
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,331
<i>and we were
just floating there,</i>

29
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,687
<i>I felt sad,</i>

30
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:02,249
and I felt like our happiness
used to be so easy

31
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,527
and there used to be
so much of it,

32
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:08,241
and now I feel like
happiness is something

33
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,448
that we have to re-create.

34
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,281
Ah.

35
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,970
I'm sorry. I tried to make
a romantic moment.

36
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,644
I'll never take you
to a fucking pool again.

37
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,808
Oh, come on.
Don't do that.

38
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,401
Okay.

39
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,681
This could be fun.

40
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,491
We're going to do a
compatibility exercise.

41
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,531
I want you both to play a note
at the same time, okay?

42
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,761
Just any note?

43
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,842
Yep. Knock yourself out.

44
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,728
[chuckles]

45
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,451
Wow! You guys are not in sync,
are you?

46
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,721
We used to be great.

47
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,165
We used to be
really irreverent and...

48
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,287
Yeah. There was teasing.

49
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,480
- Yeah.
- And stuff. Like I...

50
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,726
I mean no offense...

51
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,290
But I would call you
a bitch and it was funny.

52
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,447
Yeah, it was hilarious.

53
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,600
I used to call you a bitch.

54
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,404
- You thought it was really funny.
- Yeah.

55
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,528
I just don't know how
we're going to move forward

56
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,728
if we keep having
this circular conversation

57
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,690
about me doing what I did

58
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,603
which I have
apologized for already,

59
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,331
and we are here because
we are trying to move on.

60
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,647
I don't see why we have to
keep revisiting that

61
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,927
because it's the same conversation
over and over again.

62
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,446
Because you don't get
to decide that, Ethan.

63
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,722
You don't get to decide
when we move on, I do.

64
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,047
30, You guys having sex?

65
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,289
Now if you'd played
this one, Sophie...

66
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,044
[piano note]

67
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,645
...or that one...
...that's pretty, right?

68
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,724
But this...
...not so much.

69
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,405
Anyway, it's just an exercise.

70
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,284
I want to trust you again.

71
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,521
I want to forgive you.

72
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,761
I want
all of those things.

73
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,730
I want us
and I want us to work.

74
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,564
I don't know why you feel
like I don't want that.

75
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,211
Because we don't agree on
how we're going to get there.

76
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,291
Where are you?

77
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,887
Okay.

78
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,689
I have an idea.

79
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,966
This is a great place.

80
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,122
I think it will be
very helpful.

81
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,966
It's absolutely beautiful.

82
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,610
<i>It's about an hour and a half
north from here.</i>

83
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,365
<i>It's like a...
like a perfect retreat,</i>

84
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,851
<i>just the two of you.</i>

<i>Give you a chance
to reset the reset button.</i>

86

<i>I've sent
a lot of couples there,</i>

87
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,962
and they've all come back

88
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,280
renewed.

89
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,611
- What do you think?
- I mean, I'll try anything.

90
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,801
Sophie?

91
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,810
[keypad beeps]

92
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,361
Wow!

93
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,081
Hello?

94
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,930
And then when you
pour the wine, you do this.

95
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,360
This is what they do in
the restaurants. Watch this. Whoop.

96
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,005
So it doesn't drip.
Even though I kind of...

97
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,923
- It kind of dripped.
- I don't think you did it right.

98
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,047
Cheers!

99
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,531
To me and my cooking.

100
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,080
There's a guest house
on the property

101
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,167
which is pretty cool.

102
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,241
- Really?
- Yeah.

103
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,850
I don't even know
if we're supposed to use it

104
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,524
or if someone else
is renting it.

105
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,443
Oh, God.
What's happening?

Come here.
Come here.

Whoa!

Yeah, yeah.

You've got to hold it.

Hold it in, hold it in.

There you go.

- Geez.
- Wow, still got it.

114

Get the light going.

Give me kiss.

Aw! You're so cute
without your glasses.

You shouldn't wear these.
I like you without them.

Do you like me
without the glasses?

Do tell.

130
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,124
We need to try
more new things,

131
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,086
like weekends away
in places like this.

- You think so?
- Mmm-hmm.

It makes me excited
about us again.

Do you feel it?

Okay. Yep.

Let me just get some clothes.

I don't want to sleep
in my jeans.

00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,441
I'll be right here.

166
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,800
Okay.

167
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,369
[background tv]

168
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,921
Ha-ha! You're asleep.

169
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,526
Very funny.

170
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,089
You did it.
You got your joke.

171
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,126
[whispers] Ethan.

172
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,560
Ethan.

173
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,167
Stop it.

174
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,765
[groans]

175
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,444
Stop it. I laughed.
It's over now.

176
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,090
Where'd you go?
Where'd you go?

177
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,844
How did you get up here
so fast?

178
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,730
Did you find
a secret passageway?

179
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,323
Yeah, secret underground passage.

180
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,770
- Mmm-hmm.

181
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,965
So mysterious.

182
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,491
[groans]

183
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:03,007
No, seriously.
How did you get here so fast?

184
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,286
You beat me.

185
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,525
What?

186
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,729
How did you get here from
the guest house before me?

187
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,043
You mean, before dinner?

188
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,248
I was just walking outside
and I just walked over.

189
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,687
No, not before dinner,
just now.

190
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,765
Why are you so sweaty?

191
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,080
Did you go for a run
or something?

192
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,571
Oh, yeah.

193
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,286
Because... Is that the joke
that's happening now?

194
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,207
What?

195
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,123
The joke that you're
not going to remember

196
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,885
that we just had sex,
because that's really funny.

197
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,405
Wait!

198
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,245
We just had sex?

199
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,446
[exhales deeply]
Okay. That's not funny.

200
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,561
I'm not trying to be funny.

201
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,085
I thought you were
making a joke.

202
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,406
Why are you doing
this right now?

203
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,481
I'm not doing anything.

204
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,800
I've...

205
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:48,881
Huh?

206
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,727
You know what, Ethan?

207
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,847
You just had
a really nice night

208
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,286
and I don't know
why you would ruin it.

209
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,441
I'm not trying
to ruin our night.

210
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,567
I want to have a nice night.

211
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,721
Fine, we had sex.
It was great.

212
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,370
You were amazing.

213
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,566
You're an asshole.

214
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,680
Good night.

215
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,441
[groans]

216
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,121
I'm sorry.

217
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,045
[whispers] I love you.

218
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,645
I love you.

219
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,451
[clattering]

220
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,881
Hey.

221
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,250
Good morning, handsome.

222
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,002
Oh! I'm hungover.

223
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,605
[giggles]

224
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,371
Well, it sounds like
you need some breakfast.

225
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:34,403
Not that we need to
get back into it. Um...

226
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,406
But that was a little
bit of a weird fight last night.

227
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,927
I know.

228
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,002
I don't really understand
what happened,

229
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,081
but I feel like

230
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,360
maybe we just chalk it up
to like some bad pot...

231
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,165
Alcohol combo,
put it behind us

232
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,526
and not let it
ruin the trip.

233
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,931
Agreed, totally.

234
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,241
Cool.

235
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,727
That being said,

236
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,047
it was one of the weirder
fights we've had. Like...

237
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,360
Oh my God, I know.

238
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,607
Crazy, right?

239
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,523
I mean, I still don't
fully understand

240
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:07,371
whether you were
so drunk and stoned

241
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,646
that you thought
we had sex

242
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,366
or were you just were making
a joke and it backfired.

243
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,240
Honestly, I think it was just
one of those things, you know?

244
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,688
One of those things...
No, I'm asking you

245
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,127
was it that you were
drunk and stoned

246
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,326
or was it playing a joke...

247
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,805
Because I'm still confused
what happened.

248
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,486
I think the important thing
is that, you know,

249
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,085
we fought,
we made up,

250
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:30,010
we had a nice cuddle,
beautiful day.

251
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,320
Sophie, what are you
talking about?

252
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,727
We had a fight
and you stormed out.

253
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,921
We didn't make up.

254
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,365
Are you okay?

255
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,486
I'm fine, are you okay? I'm...

256
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:42,006
Okay, Mr. Hangover.

257
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,525
I think it's time
for some food. Huh?

258
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,648
Let's get something
in your stomach.

259
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,802
You're kind of freaking me out
a little bit, Sophie.

260
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,009
I've got to say...
Is that bacon?

261
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,521
Yeah.

262
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,687
You hate it
when I eat bacon.

263
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,010
[water running]

264
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,960
What?

265
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,325
What's going on?

266
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,408
That's what
I'm trying to figure out.

267
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,722
I don't understand
why you're doing this.

268
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,241
No.

269
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,731
No, no, no, no.

270
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,001
No what?

271
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,411
This was...
There were plates... Hello?

272
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,606
What are you
talking about plates?

273
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,841
Hello, hello?
What are you... Ethan?

274
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,450
- Where'd you go?
- Where'd who go?

275
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,046
Ethan?

276
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,641
Hello?

277
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,051
Ethan?

278
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,645
There was bacon right there
on those plates...

279
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,728
What are you talking about?
Ethan, answer me.

280
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,001
You can't...
The smell of bacon...

281
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:20,003
You can't get the smell of bacon
out in five minutes.

282
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,411
- There was bacon...
- What about bacon?

283
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,811
Right here.
There was bacon here.

284
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,491
Why are you acting like this?

285
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,489
Shit. Sophie, Sophie.

286
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,641
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

287
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,206
Sophie, Sophie...

288
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,407
- What?
- I'm sorry.

289
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,686
- What?
- I'm sorry, just wait.

290
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,250
I'm spazzing out
in there, I know,

291
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,004
but something
fucking weird

292
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,242
like Twilight Zone shit
is going on here,

293
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,522
and I'm trying to get
a handle on it, okay?

294
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,525
Last night
we had a nice dinner.

295
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,886
We had a blast together, right?

296
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,087
- Yes.
- Okay.

297
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,605
Then, we smoked some pot.

298
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,325
I fell asleep on the couch.

299
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,444
Next thing I know,
you woke me up

300
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,483
claiming that we had
just had sex together.

301
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,011
Because we did!

302
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,001
Okay. I came here.

303
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,121
Nobody was here.

304
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,361
I fell asleep on this couch

305
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,488
and I woke up
to you snuggling me.

306
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,880
What? What are you
talking about?

307
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,126
No, I didn't.

308
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,884
That's crazy to me
that you would deny that, okay?

309
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,564
- I didn't.
- Exactly.

310
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,529
Crazy just like me denying
that I had slept with you.

311
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,125
You know what I'm saying?

312
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:15,167
We had two completely separate
experiences with each other

313
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:18,130
that neither of us remembers, and...

314
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,768
Hang on a second. I'm going to
go in there by myself, okay?

315
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,927
Why?

316
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,331
You just stay here for like
30 seconds.

317
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,561
- Don't move.
- Ethan!

318
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,761
[water running]

319
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,926
Hello?

320
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,921
Hey, Babe.

321
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,769
Can you hand me a towel?

322
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,081
You're in that shower.

323
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,650
I just handed you a towel.

324
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,320
Okay, you know what,
I'm not even mad any more.

325
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,765
Now you're just scaring me,

326
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,760
and I don't understand
why you're doing this.

327
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,689
Go, go see for yourself, Sophie.

328
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,280
Be careful.

329
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,805
[groans]

330
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,564
Hey, where you been all morning?

331
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,211
Hello, Sophie.

332
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,290
I was just walking.

333
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,401
Oh, yeah.

334
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,209
It's really nice out, huh?

335
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,611
It's actually
a little bright in here.

336
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,444
Do you mind
if I close these?

337
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,521
Mmm-mmm.

338
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,809
The morning sun here
is insane.

339
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,604
Give me a hug.

340
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,165
Sorry. I'm a little sweaty.

341
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,771
That's okay.

342
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,360
Come on.

343
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,521
Sophie.

344
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,246
Soph?

345
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,926
Fuck this.

346
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,080
You're kidding me!

347
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:30,921
What the fuck?

348
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,161
Sophie?

349
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,529
Oh my God!
Hey, are you okay?

350
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,565
You're in there.
It's you.

351
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,571
You're exercising.

352
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,485
What is happening?

353
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,005
I don't know.

354
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,246
This is so crazy.

355
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,410
Did that really happen?

356
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,891
I mean, did that, was that...

357
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,650
I just don't...
I don't understand.

358
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,565
Is it another dimension,

359
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,290
like when you go
through the door,

360
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:23,046
is it another plane
of existence or...

361
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,326
I don't know.

362
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,481
I've no clue.

363
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,164
I think we need to just say

364
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,369
some weird shit happened.

365
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,720
We compartmentalize it.

366
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,286
There was a cosmic
aberration of some sort...

367
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,806
- Yeah, yeah. Move on.
- And we go home.

368
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,120
We don't talk
about this again,

369
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,406
and we just stop
thinking about it.

370
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,646
Okay.

371
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,447
- Yeah. We could move on.
- Done.

372
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:50,201
Oh my God, I can't
stop thinking about it.

373
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,366
Can you?

374
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,080
We're just going to
have to just...

375
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,764
I guess time, you know...

376
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,446
I'm not going to be able to
stop thinking about this, Ethan.

377
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,891
Well, what else can we do?

378
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:06,080
I mean what are we, what are
we going to do, you know?

379
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,481
Well, I mean, there's the...

380
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,643
There's the crazy thing
to do which is...

381
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,007
What?

382
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,291
Which is to, you know,
explore it further.

383
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,526
Explore it further?

384
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,125
I know you only had
a little bit of it...

385
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,800
Yeah. I was there for
like three seconds.

386
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,884
I know. And I,
but I had a whole evening...

387
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,526
In that house,
and I have to say,

388
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:34,008
I know I sound like
a crazy person right now,

389
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:36,964
but I have to say
it was kind of magical.

390
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,566
- Well...
- It was...

391
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,291
But don't go overboard
with the whole magic

392
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,601
of what happened there

393
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,125
because I know what you
did in there, okay?

394
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,725
All right. That's not
what I'm talking about.

395
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,211
I'm not talking about
that kind of magic.

396
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,731
There was a rush.

397
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:52,646
It was exciting.
I felt happy.

398
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,007
And it wasn't just that.

399
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,531
It wasn't just the time
in the guest house.

400
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,331
We had a great time
in the main house.

401
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,124
Yes, we did.
We had a good time.

402
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,571
It wasn't just the weed.

403
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,682
I mean we were connecting,
we were talking,

404
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,524
we were happy,
we were... Happy.

405
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,681
Yes.

406
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:10,287
We also had a fantastic time
when we did ecstasy at Lalapalooza,

407
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,124
but we're not going to do that
every day of our lives

408
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,247
because you die...

409
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,401
- Right.
- Okay?

410
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,891
There's a question
of our safety here.

411
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,486
Yeah. But I didn't feel
like it was dangerous.

412
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,967
I didn't feel...
I felt safe.

413
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,171
I didn't feel dangerous, either.

414
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,486
I felt like I was with you.

415
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:28,211
This is something that we've
been talking about in therapy...

416
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:31,649
Exploring new options,
creating a new relationship...

417
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,768
Not going back to the past

418
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,122
and re-creating
old things that happened

419
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,969
but starting
with new things.

420
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,491
Yeah. Point taken.

421
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,561
I know that this is...

422
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,045
I didn't imagine
this sort of...

423
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,246
...extreme.
- ...new thing.

424
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,321
Absolutely, but...

425
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,488
I imagined like
horseback riding

426
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:49,251
with a little satchel of wine,
you know?

427
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,044
Not exploring other dimensions

428
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,925
<i>in some weird version oi
Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?</i>

429
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,321
What if this is something
that I want to do?

430
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,330
You want to go back?

431
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,721
I want to help
our relationship.

432
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:15,602
So... A little weird
to say this,

433
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,485
but I'm struggling
a little bit with the fact

434
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:22,406
that you slept with
the other me last night.

435
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,485
Yeah, but I thought
it was you.

436
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,170
I know. I'm not mad
or blaming you.

437
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:30,449
I just like...
I'd be lying if I, you know,

438
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,523
didn't say I was a little jealous,
I guess.

439
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,210
All right.
I understand,

440
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,722
but obviously I would never
knowingly cheat on you.

441
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:42,605
So it seems like it only works
if we go in one at a time.

442
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,767
Correct.

443
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,525
So I guess we'll just figure out
who wants to go in there first.

444
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,608
[Sophie] I'll be out in a minute,
sweetheart.

445
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,446
Okay, I'm here.

446
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,201
That's good.

447
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,685
Hey, is that bacon okay?

448
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,564
It's been sitting out
for awhile.

449
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,161
It's good.

450
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,806
Good.

451
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,929
Where have you been
all morning?

452
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,041
Hanging out, you know.

453
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,286
Cool.

454
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,481
I missed you.

455
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,084
You missed me?

456
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,321
Of course.

457
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:51,966
Come sit with me.

458
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,850
Okay.

459
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,246
So...

460
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,446
So...

461
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,201
Isn't it crazy to think
that we're actually married?

462
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,009
[giggles]

463
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,206
I guess so.

464
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,440
We are husband and wife.

465
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:12,966
- I know.
- Yeah.

466
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,320
I love it.

467
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,002
How long have you been
here, by the way?

468
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:19,328
Since we came yesterday, silly.

469
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,484
No, I mean,
in the guest house.

470
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,409
Since we slept here
last night.

471
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,400
Uh-oh. Someone's in detective mode.

472
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,646
Sorry. I didn't mean to be.

473
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,563
That's okay.
I don't mind.

474
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,083
Have you explored
the grounds very much?

475
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,403
I think I have
a pretty good sense of it.

476
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,804
It's so pretty here,
isn't it?

477
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,326
It is. Would you like to go on
a walk with me?

478
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,401
Not really right now,

479
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,329
but you're welcome
to go on a walk.

480
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,970
It's your vacation, too.

481
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,841
Okay.

482
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,169
I'll see you
in a little bit, Sophie.

483
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,362
Okay, Ethan.

484
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,441
Whoa!

485
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,846
- Fascinating.
- Tell me.

486
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:07,323
Okay. That being in there is
100% convinced that she is you.

487
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,447
- She is?
- Yeah.

488
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,050
I threw out
some soft challenges.

489
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,690
She is unflappable.

490
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,761
I think when
you go in there...

491
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:13,841
God, it's crazy.

492
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:16,691
Yeah, you throw out some
like very specific examples

493
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,444
from our past
and see how he reacts.

494
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,521
Oh, no, no, sweetie.

495
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,250
I don't think we're
supposed to challenge them.

496
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:24,164
What if they disappear
or something, you know?

497
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,169
What if they freak out?
I'm just saying what's the harm

498
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,931
in letting them think
that they're us?

499
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,128
Yeah, I mean, I...
All right.

500
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,931
There's no harm in it.

501
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,809
I just thought
part of the fun of this

502
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,042
was like the investigation
and trying to...

503
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,400
I know. Of course
you thought

504
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,010
the fun was in
the investigation.

505
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,246
Wait, hold on.

506
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,566
It's like at
the magic show in Vegas

507
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,006
when you told me
how the magician

508
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,406
did every single trick

509
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,528
and you ruined the entire show
for me and everyone around us.

510
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,649
Okay. You remember we talked
about the magic show

511
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,643
was three years ago
and we're moving past that?

512
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,245
- Okay.
- Yeah.

513
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,685
Let's go inside.

514
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,290
We'll make up
some ground rules together.

515
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,850
That way neither of us
feels like, you know,

516
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,081
there's any kind of...

517
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,201
Confusion.

518
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,851
- Or just being on the same page.
- Okay.

519
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,565
While we are
in the guest house

520
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:09,088
with the weird people,
no intimacy, no sex.

521
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,810
Yes. Absolutely agreed.

522
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,126
- No sex.
- Good.

523
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,241
What else?

524
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,084
Well, I would say that
would lead me to,

525
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,241
you know, no spying

526
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,050
and there has to be
trust involved,

527
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,003
and we'll be honest with each
other about what happens

528
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,326
in the guest house and...

529
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,601
Right. It's like a...

530
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,165
It's like a therapy exercise
in trust almost.

531
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,520
- It's a trust exercise.
- Okay, great.

532
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,761
- That's why we're here.
- Good.

533
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:27,841
Um...

534
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,085
Let's see.

535
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,447
I guess if there's
anything else...

536
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,489
Actually this is kind of
really important

537
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,891
now that I think about it.

538
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,651
We can have fun with this,
but if at any point either of us

539
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,848
becomes uncomfortable and
wants to stop,

540
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,367
we just cut it off,
pack our bags...

541
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,487
Absolutely.

542
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,846
Absolutely. Agreed.

543
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,410
That's a good one,
that's a really good one.

544
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,561
Yeah.

545
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,761
Anything else?

546
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,681
I think thats it.

547
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,125
Then we are done.
Those are good.

548
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,931
So since we're just kind of
like dipping our toes in here,

549
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,968
I think maybe we shouldn't
spend too much time in there

550
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,041
the first go-around.

551
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,168
Okay. How does
15 minutes sound?

552
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,484
Yeah, I think that's good.

553
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:07,730
Okay, but don't, you know,
stand outside waiting for me.

554
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,450
Wait, what?

555
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,329
Well, you know, I think
it's going to make me nervous

556
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,323
if I think you're waiting
right outside the door.

557
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,565
Yeah, okay.
That's fair.

558
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,085
Oh, you mean,
like right now?

559
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:26,049
- Yeah. Yeah, okay.
- Yes, sorry.

560
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,571
- Okay. Go ahead.
- Okay.

561
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,640
Enjoy yourself,
but be safe.

562
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,961
Hey.

563
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,326
It's nice.

564
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:17,887
You could be honest.

565
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,325
I handle the criticism.

566
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,004
No, it's...

567
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,640
Okay.

568
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,522
I think I look
a little severe.

569
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,525
Is that how you see me?

570
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,567
No.

571
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,842
[both laughing]

572
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:39,002
I'm just not
a very good painter.

573
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,127
No.

574
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,687
I was trying to emulate Degas

575
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:57,966
who lights up his portrait faces
with all these wonderful colors.

576
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,121
Degas?

577
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,124
Unfortunately, it looks like
your face was lit on fire...

578
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,520
[giggles]

579
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,001
Which was not my intention.
I apologize.

580
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,082
But it yielded
a wonderful title, though.

581
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,650
- Uh-huh.
- I'm thinking of calling it

582
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:13,281
"Sophie My Love,
the Burn Victim."

583
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:17,160
Or the ultimate tittle
"Sophie My Love, the Full-On Bitch"

584
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,890
because l look
awfully bitchy.

585
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,166
- Well...
- Sorry.

586
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,607
Well, in all fairness,
sometimes you're a bitch.

587
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,366
Excuse me?

588
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,601
Yeah, but it's cool

589
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,603
because I'm an asshole
sometimes, you know?

590
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,801
Right.

591
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,530
We can say that, right?

592
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,329
No, I think it's good.

593
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,886
- Scoot over.
- Thanks.

594
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,804
[groans] Okay.

595
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,241
Cheers.

596
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,445
- Cheers.
- To a perfect weekend together.

597
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,641
Hmm.

598
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,845
That's very nice.

599
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,045
Where you going?

600
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:04,566
Nowhere but here.

601
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,490
Why are you nervous?

602
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,965
I'm not nervous.

603
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:11,765
[giggles]
Why do you think I'm nervous?

604
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,609
Give me your hand.

605
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:14,801
Hmm?

606
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,210
What? Don't you trust me?

607
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,281
What the fuck?

608
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,485
You were spying on me.

609
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,722
Well, yeah. You were
like over 20 minutes in there.

610
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:16,764
Over 20... We didn't agree it
would be exactly 15 minutes,

611
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,808
- five minutes over?
- Yeah, but you know,

612
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,167
we didn't agree on like
intimate massages either.

613
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:22,924
Wait, wait. Intimate,
intimate massages?

614
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,082
- Are you serious?
- You were into it.

615
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,486
I was not into...

616
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,606
I was rocking your body
in there.

617
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,045
All right. All right.

618
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:33,050
I'm sorry. I can see how that
might have made you uncomfortable,

619
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:34,764
and I apologize.

620
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:37,286
- It's a little confusing, Sorry.
- All right. It won't happen again.

621
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,361
- Okay.
- Understood.

622
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:41,091
- How was it in general though?
- Oh my God, it's so weird.

623
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:43,208
- It's so strange.
- It's really odd.

624
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,567
I mean, you were just...
You were wonderful.

625
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:47,051
You were funny and charming,

626
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,327
and you just kept telling me
all these great things

627
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,488
we should do
on the property and...

628
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,644
Does he feel like me to you?

629
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,843
He is you...
He's just a little...

630
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,724
A little what?

631
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,201
[sighs]

632
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:07,411
It's... How to describe it...
You know,

633
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:11,371
it's like you're funny,
you know.

634
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:14,165
You have a great sense of humor
and everyone likes you and...

635
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,241
Thanks.

636
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:17,004
And that's who you are...
In there,

637
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:19,083
but it's like a memory of it.

638
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,680
It's like I'm being
reminded of it or something,

639
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:24,121
but it's happening
right in front of me.

640
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,362
- Hmm.
- Does that make any sense?

641
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:31,328
You're not saying
that like it's like...

642
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,169
The better version
when you're in there, right?

643
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,924
- No, no, no, no, no.
- You're just...

644
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,360
Not at all.
That's the crazy thing.

645
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,607
It is you in there, you know?

646
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,806
What about the physicality...
Do you notice any differences?

647
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,806
No. No, not really.

648
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,041
Yeah.

649
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,250
You know what, the hair.

650
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,564
There's something
about the hair.

651
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,081
The hair?

652
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,400
Mmm-hmm. It's a little different.

653
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:01,769
It's like it's a little messier,
it's kind of beachy.

654
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,284
- Did you say beachy?
- Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

655
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,680
Come here. Let me see.

656
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,531
It's like, like kind of... No.

657
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,523
Well, well, it's like really...

658
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:14,046
I don't know. I'm not doing it right
or something.

659
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:16,881
- I don't know.
- Yeah.

660
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,041
Don't worry about it.

661
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,525
Cool.

662
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,331
Oh, and you know what,
you don't wear glasses.

663
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:26,410
You don't wear glasses in there
and you seem totally fine with it.

664
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,606
Well.

665
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:30,681
[giggles]

666
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,441
In the guest house,
I'm a surfer with perfect vision.

667
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,681
We'll work on this.

668
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,889
It's not quite...
No, it's good.

669
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,371
We're getting there.

670
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,766
[giggles]

671
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,762
You've tried contacts, right?

672
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:01,920
Hey, Soph?

673
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,845
Hmm?

674
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:08,003
I'd like to take my session
at the guest house now if that's cool.

675
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,485
What time is it?

676
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,562
It's late,
but I just can't sleep.

677
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:16,084
Oh, okay, sweetie.

678
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,207
Okay. I love you.

679
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,766
I love you.

680
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,368
What are you talking about? There are
like six versions of the same doll.

681
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,083
They're completely
unique in every way.

682
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,043
There are six
different ladies here.

683
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,403
- I don't see it.
- Okay.

684
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:08,369
This one is the beautiful model
who is always talking about

685
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:10,727
how she was such a nerd
in high school,

686
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,728
and then oh, this one...
It definitely has two

687
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,451
tramp stamps underneath
that dress, for sure.

688
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,564
And then you've got...

689
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:23,530
This one is the coolest girl
in the world,

690
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,328
and she'd make
the most wonderful wife,

691
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:29,609
but no one's going to be able
to look past her chubby thighs.

692
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,486
Which one of these is your favorite?
Which one do you like the most?

693
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,601
Okay.

694
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,530
Ready for this?

695
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,005
Ooh, I dropped it.

696
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,203
How is that not the cutest
thing you've ever seen?

697
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,282
- It really is cute.
- It's so tiny.

698
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,725
It's adorable.

699
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,521
[Sophie] Hey.

700
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,006
Hi.

701
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:35,841
What you doing?

702
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,406
Nothing. What are you doing?

703
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:38,646
Nothing.

704
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,281
Have you...

705
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,326
Have I what?

706
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:48,721
Nothing.

707
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,200
Never mind.

708
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,088
So, what's on
the agenda for today?

709
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,761
I was going to maybe
go explore some more

710
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:58,727
and you know, just...
If that's okay.

711
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,569
- Of course.
- What about you?

712
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:03,889
I don't know. I thought I'd maybe
just hang out here, read.

713
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,042
Sounds nice.
Maybe I'll come by in a little bit

714
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,451
and we can spend some time.

715
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:09,846
Whatever you want.

716
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,126
Great.

717
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,445
Oh, I found your phone.

718
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,846
- Thanks.
- Mmm-hmm.

719
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:38,007
[static buzzing]

720
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,405
Come on.

721
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,006
Hello.

722
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,004
[Ethan] I'm up here.

723
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:18,685
Watch your head, okay?

724
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,291
Very cute up here.

725
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:25,800
It's a little small.

726
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,160
[giggles]

727
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,571
What are you doing up here?

728
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,686
I'm feeling very big.

729
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:34,204
I feel enormous.

730
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,281
[giggling]

731
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,010
Um, I'm glad you're here

732
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:39,401
because there is something
I want to talk to you about.

733
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,285
And it's a bit of
an elephant in the room,

734
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:44,882
and I think it's time
we discuss it.

735
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,764
- All right.
- Okay.

736
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:57,601
[giggles]

737
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,570
- This...
- Oh, that.

738
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:00,641
...is happening.

739
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,762
- Oh, Well.
- Ladies first.

740
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,121
In that case.

741
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:06,649
- Who the fuck starts with O?
- I know.

742
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,722
- Who the hell do you think you are?
- It's crazy.

743
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,041
Goddamn anarchist.

744
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:12,840
All right.
I'll just do an X in the middle.

745
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,211
That's a great move.

746
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,323
I think I see
where this is headed.

747
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,283
I'm not quite sure yet.

748
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:25,890
Yeah, I'm going to
block you there.

749
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,962
- Where do you think I should go?
- How's it going to end?

750
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,280
What do you think I
should do?

751
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,926
- Who's going to win?
- Oh, the suspense!

752
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:34,088
Oh, yes, and there it is.

753
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,247
What's your next game?

754
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:38,210
My next game is something
that is appropriate

755
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:39,810
for people
over the age of six.

756
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:40,967
I think that's a thing.

757
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:43,083
Why don't you kiss me any more?

758
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,327
Um, I've enjoyed
just hanging out

759
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,568
and reconnecting and...

760
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:50,880
I have, too.

761
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:55,602
I know, but I love kissing you
and I miss it.

762
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,926
Is there something I'm doing
that's bothering you or...

763
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,929
Oh my God, no, not at all.

764
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,760
Because I feel like
we're having a good time?

765
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,681
- We're having a great time.
- Yeah.

766
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:11,771
- Give me this.
- You're taking my chalk.

767
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,444
That's my...
That's my chalk.

768
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,124
I know it's your chalk.

769
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,126
Hey.

770
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:25,691
All right.
This is weird,

771
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:28,121
but I think
some of my shirts are missing.

772
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:30,170
- Really?
- Yeah.

773
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:34,203
Are you sure they're not
just hanging in the closet

774
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,129
and you didn't pack them
like you usually do?

775
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:39,090
No, no. Stuff that I packed
is not here.

776
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:42,366
- Well, that's weird.
- Yeah. That's weird.

What's so funny?

00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,004
Oh, nothing, I guess.

781
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:56,048
Just a funny text.

782
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:57,970
Oh yeah?
Who's texting you?

783
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,001
Um...

784
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:05,848
Wait, he's texting you?

Babe, it's nothing.

00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:08,844
It's just a text, okay?

787
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:11,367
I'm not upset.
I just think it's weird.

788
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:14,202
They have cellphones?

789
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:19,844
What plan
do they even have?

790
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:55,650
- Thanks.
- Mmm-hmm.

So nice outside today.

[clears throat] Um...

793
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:08,122
Can I ask you a question?

794
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,006
Of course.

795
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:15,482
Why did you do it?

796
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:21,408
Why did you cheat on me?

797
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,967
I'm sorry.
That's probably...

798
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,490
- That's okay.
- Not something you want to...

799
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:29,891
No, that's okay.

800
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:33,847
I have been thinking
about that a bit this weekend,

801
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:36,441
and

802
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:40,370
I have no excuse.

803
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:44,364
Of course I was insecure

804
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:48,081
and of course we were
drifting apart at the time

805
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:51,120
and instead of trying
to communicate

806
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:54,244
I lashed out and I made
a terrible decision,

807
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:55,961
and

808
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:58,681
that's...

809
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:00,801
Right.

810
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:03,687
No, let me finish.

811
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:06,002
That's no excuse.

00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:12,966
You had every right
to abandon me,

813
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:21,883
but you didn't,
and you stuck in there with me

814
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:25,726
and you went to see that stupid
therapist that we see,

815
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:29,646
even though we didn't want to,
and you kept going,

816
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:32,769
and you kept trying,
and you met me halfway

817
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:38,688
and I was defensive
and I'm sorry about that.

818
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:44,041
And I want to say thank you
for making those efforts for us,

819
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:49,405
and I promise you
I'm going to do my best

820
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:52,689
to meet you there, okay?

821
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:54,771
I promise.

822
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:27,680
Hello.

823
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:28,927
Hey.

824
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:31,169
I didn't hear you
get up this morning.

825
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:35,082
I just came down to see
if there was anything on TV.

826
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:39,204
What, do you think
I'm lying to you?

827
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:40,606
No.

828
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:43,691
No, I was...
Just seemed to...

829
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:50,409
ls there anything
you want to talk about?

830
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:52,246
No.

831
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:55,330
There anything
you want to talk about?

832
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:57,369
Look, this weekend
is super weird...

833
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:58,726
- That's okay, right?
- Yeah.

834
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:02,486
I mean, you know,
I think it can be confusing,

835
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:05,120
but I just...

836
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:08,284
You know it's not real, right?

837
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:12,524
I mean, I'm not that guy
out there doing sit-ups...

838
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:21,200
And I could never
be really interested

839
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:23,169
in some other version of you,

840
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:26,762
knowing that my real Sophie
is here...

841
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:29,048
- Right.
- And I just...

842
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,522
I want to make sure
you still agree.

843
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:32,766
Yeah.

844
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:34,881
Of course.

845
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:36,401
- Okay.
- Yeah.

846
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:37,561
Okay.

847
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:38,641
[giggles]

848
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:42,043
- Okay. We good?
- Yeah, we're good.

849
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:44,527
- Of course we're good.
- All right.

850
00:48:58,480 --> 00:48:59,891

851
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:07,930
<i>Thanks a lot for calling me at two in
the morning. I really appreciate it.</i>

852

to wake up for tomorrow.</i>

<i>Maybe next time you can't
remember where you live,</i>

854
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:14,890
<i>you should ask your wife.</i>

855

<i>I'm not sure
what you were doing</i>

856

857

<i>[woman] Hey, Bunny.
It's mama.</i>

our conversation yesterday.</i>

859
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:25,641
<i>I don't know.</i>

860
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:27,529
<i>You just didn't sound
like your usual self,</i>

861
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:29,807
<i>so I just wanted to be sure
you're okay...</i>

862
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,731
<i>[man] Hey, man. The street
you grew up on was Berkman.</i>

863
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:34,485
<i>Hope that clears things up.</i>

864
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:36,085
<i>Talk to you soon.</i>

865
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:47,681
Hey.

866
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:49,201
- Hey.
- Um...

867
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:52,440
So something really weird
just happened.

868
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:56,565
I got a bunch of voice mails
from my mom and Doug and Dave

869
00:49:56,680 --> 00:50:00,002
saying I had called them
asking really weird questions,

870
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:02,882
but I didn't call them.

871
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:05,762
- That is weird.
- Yeah.

872
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:08,208
Do you think
you pocket dialed them?

873
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:10,800
I don't think the pocket dial
makes as much sense

874
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:13,087
because I was talking
and asking questions.

875
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:15,481
- I would have...
- So what do you think it was?

876
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,526
Oh, you think
that he called them.

877
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,482
Yeah, and to me
that's a logical conclusion.

878
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:26,562
He looks like me.
He sounds like me.

879
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:27,641
He's got a cellphone.

880
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:30,530
I think he might be
impersonating me or something.

881
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:33,810
Right. I just don't think that
he would do that.

882
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:35,962
Do you think
you know him that well?

883
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:40,488
Well, I mean I know him
a little better than you do.

884
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:42,085
You've never met him.

885
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:44,247
But I mean it's weird.

886
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:46,800
I can totally
ask him if you want.

887
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:48,526
No, that's okay.

888
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:49,806
- It's just...
- Okay.

889
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:51,240
- It's just a weird thing.
- Okay.

890
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:52,520
It is weird.

891
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:58,886
I'm going to go to the store.
Do you want me to get you anything?

892
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:01,531
Uh, no. I'm good.

893
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:04,326
- Thanks.
- Well, you can come if you want.

894
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:07,450
Do you mind
if I just hang out here?

895
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:11,281
- Of course not.
- Okay.

896
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:12,720
Okay.

897
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:01,410
Hey, babe.

898
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:03,040
Uh, sorry.

899
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:04,726
Great.

900
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:35,366
Hey.

901
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:37,410
Is this a bad time?

902
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:38,801
No, no.

903
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:42,123
I was, doing some sit-ups.

904
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:46,771
I need to talk to you.

905
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,200
What do you want
to talk about?

906
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:51,129
What happened
the last time I was here.

907
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:56,965
Yeah, that was obviously
important. Yeah.

908
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:00,123
Ethan, you're so good
at articulating

909
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:03,363
exactly what it is
that I'm feeling

910
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:06,330
in a way
that I can't even do,

911
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:08,448
and it's everything
that I've been wanting to hear,

912
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:10,522
but now I don't know
what to do.

913
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:12,844
I can't get it
out of my head.

914
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:22,487
Well, I'm glad I said

915
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:24,927
what you wanted to hear,
you know.

916
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:32,690
Is there anything else
you wanted to see me about?

917
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,764
[heavy breathing]

918
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:50,440
[whispers] I've missed this.

919
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:55,325
Me too.

920
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:03,689
[breathing heavily]

921
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:04,601
Hi.

922
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:08,485
Where are the groceries?

923
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:12,406
What?

924
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:14,722
What about the store?
What happened?

925
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:18,768
- The store was closed.
- Oh.

926
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:46,766
Hey, how about I make us
a couple of mimosas?

927
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:52,804
I'm not really in the mood
for a mimosa right now, Sophie.

928
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:55,647
Aw, come on.
It'll be fun.

929
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:58,162
We'll have a drink.
We'll relax.

930
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:00,169
Start this day off right.

931
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:03,365
Then we can talk about
whatever is bothering you.

932
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:07,287
You know,
that's really good advice.

933
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:10,482
And I should probably
listen to it...

934
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:14,603
But you're not a real person.

935
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:22,604
You know you're not real.

936
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:26,846
Who the hell are you?

937
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:30,562
What the hell are you?
Are you a fucking robot?

938
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:35,043
Are you a...
Like a spirit?

939
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:39,443
Because I've got to say
it's bad enough

940
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:43,242
that I'm losing my wife
to a mirror image of me

941
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:45,288
who happens to be
like 20% cooler

942
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:48,125
and 20% more emotionally
evolved than me.

943
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:51,807
Now I have to sit
and look at a mirror image

944
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:54,167
of exactly who I'm losing.

945
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:57,170
So, no...

946
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:59,524
I'm having a hard time
enjoying this weekend

947
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:01,602
because this is the weekend
I lose my wife.

948
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:04,763
So, pardon me if I don't want
a fucking mimosa, okay?

949
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:11,928
It wasn't just this weekend.

950
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:17,920
How do you know?

951
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:24,960
Because as your wife,
I know these things.

952
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:57,365
[sighs]

953
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:58,766
Shit!

954
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:14,481
[humming]

955
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:16,688
Uh-oh. I can't stop it.
I can't stop it.

956
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:18,808
Look what you did.
Look what you did.

957
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:22,091
[giggles]

958
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:23,730
What? Souvenir?

959
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:25,245
Here comes the firehose.

960
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,525
I'm going to spray you down.
Are you on fire?

961
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:29,602
Why are you twirling a fire hose?

962
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:31,409
[Spraying sounds]

963
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:34,407
Where did you
get this sweater?

964
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:36,525
What?

965
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:38,929
Where'd you get this?

966
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,570
I don't know.
I've always had it.

967
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:42,768
- Really?
- Yeah, you just...

968
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:44,729
You don't notice
my clothes, I guess.

969
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:47,968
Do you remember
when you got it?

970
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:50,969
Do you want to
talk about clothes?

971
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:55,568
Or would you rather have the
full Chippendales experience?

972
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:56,971
What's the full experience?

973
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:58,087
Well...

974
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:00,049
I don't think
I have enough cash on me.

975
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:02,771
You just put that away.
You don't worry about that.

976
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:04,445
[giggling]

977
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:17,841
Sophie?

978
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:25,930
Sophie, open the door.

979
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:27,405
Come on. It's me.

980
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:29,721
[bangs on door]

981
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:31,450
I know you're in there
with him, Sophie.

982
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:34,171
Come on. Open up!

983
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:36,686
Will you just give me...
Hold on one second.

984
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:39,049
[Ethan] Sophie, come on.
Let me in.

985
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:40,681
Sophie.

986
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:42,967
I'm just going to
keep knocking.

987
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:45,361
I'm going to keep knocking.

988
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:46,646
I know what you're
doing in there.

989
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:47,846
I'm going to keep knocking.

990
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:49,490
Sophie, let me in.

991
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:51,130
Come on, Sophie.
Open up.

992
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,684
- Where is he?
- Ethan, what are you doing?

993
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:57,762
- Where are you?
- Ethan, come on.

994
00:59:57,840 --> 00:59:58,841
Ethan, stop!

995
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:00,206
I'll beat his ass.
Where are you?

996
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:01,281
Where are you?

997
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:02,521
Goddamn it!

998
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:06,006
Good. He's gone.

999
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:07,605
What the hell
is going on in here?

1000
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:09,205
Where did he go?
Look what you did!

1001
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:10,566
What I did?
Are you insane?

1002
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:11,641
Yes, what you did.

1003
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:13,370
What if he never comes back?

1004
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:16,090
Sophie, come on.

1005
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:17,884
Sophie, get back here.

1006
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:19,201
Sophie.

1007
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:21,362
He is not real, okay?

1008
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:23,283
Sophie, how can you
accept something

1009
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:24,805
that you know
is a blatant lie?

1010
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:26,803
You keep saying
it's not real, it's not real,

1011
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:28,723
but I'm happy-

1012
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:30,768
I'm feeling that.
How is that fake?

1013
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:33,161
Do you hear
how insane you sound?

1014
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:35,642
You're not admitting that this
is just the least bit weird?

1015
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:37,683
It's not weird for me any more.

1016
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:40,521
So what's the endgame? Huh?

1017
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:42,011
How do you see
this playing out?

1018
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:43,320
Are you going to
write letters,

1019
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:44,930
come back and visit
after we leave this weekend?

1020
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,161
I'm not leaving.

1021
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:50,926
What do you mean,
you're not leaving?

1022
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:52,087
Sophie,

1023
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:53,571
what the hell
do you mean you're...

1024
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:56,007
This is...
Okay, all right.

1025
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:57,961
Sophie, come on.

1026
01:00:58,040 --> 01:00:59,804
Let's just take
a breath here, okay?

1027
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:02,565
I know you're feeling
something that is magical

1028
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:04,005
and clearly exciting to you,

1029
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:07,368
but if you think about it logically,
literally for one second...

1030
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:18,966
Is this weird for you now?

1031
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:29,923
Does anybody remember any of
those fun icebreaker games

1032
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:32,611
that kids do at summer camp...

1033
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:33,681
[laughing]

1034
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:36,046
Spin the bottle

1035
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:39,124
or seven minutes
in heaven or something...

1036
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:41,448
Anyhow, we just thought
it was time

1037
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:43,369
that the four of us sit down

1038
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:45,249
and get to know each other
a little bit.

1039
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:47,089
You want to get to
know each other?

1040
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:48,764
Hi, Sophie.

1041
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:50,120
Hi.

1042
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:54,322
Okay. Um...

1043
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:56,243
Let's get to
know each other.

1044
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:58,800
Why don't you tell us the truth
of what's really going on?

1045
01:01:58,880 --> 01:01:59,927
The truth?

1046
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,685
Yeah, that you basically
have been pretending to be me,

1047
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:04,290
acting like
I don't exist

1048
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:06,567
even though you knew
I was here the whole time.

1049
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:09,804
Ethan, I wasn't
pretending to be anyone.

1050
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:11,724
I was just being myself.

1051
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:14,050
You knew about me, right?

1052
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:16,169
Did he mention me to you
at any point?

1053
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:17,770
Not until this morning.

1054
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,490
All right.
Maybe all of us

1055
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:23,325
were doing a little pretending
this weekend.

1056
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:24,930
It's not a big deal.

1057
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,684
I really like your shoes.

1058
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:30,122
Oh, thank you.

1059
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:33,961
I really like your hair
pinned back like that.

1060
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:35,645
It's super cute.

1061
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:40,089
I'm sorry. I still am not
buying that you are real.

1062
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:42,841
[Ethan 2] Ethan, I'm sitting here,

1063
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:44,611
you're looking at me
sitting here.

1064
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:45,920
I'm real.

1065
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,764
You're sitting across
from me, right?

1066
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:49,245
I'm looking at you
sitting there,

1067
01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:53,081
so by your logic
maybe you're not real.

1068
01:02:53,720 --> 01:02:55,609
That doesn't make any sense.

1069
01:02:57,120 --> 01:02:58,246
I'm starving.

1070
01:02:58,320 --> 01:02:59,800
Ethan, why don't you
clean yourself up

1071
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:01,245
and we'll all have
a little dinner.

1072
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:12,441
There.

1073
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:17,841
So, anybody interested
in going on a hike tomorrow?

1074
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:19,888
I've been wanting to do that
ever since we got here.

1075
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:21,325
I would love that.

1076
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:22,885
All right.

1077
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:25,042
Tonight though,
I'm thinking game night.

1078
01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:26,406
All right.

1079
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:29,131
Okay, maybe you're real,
but can we admit

1080
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:31,322
this isn't some normal
dinner party?

1081
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:33,050
Ethan, you're looking
a little uncomfortable.

1082
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:34,286
Can I help you with something?

1083
01:03:34,360 --> 01:03:36,169
Okay, so according to you,

1084
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:38,288
this is just
some average weekend.

1085
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:39,805
We all go home tomorrow,

1086
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:43,208
and you don't need any
further explanation than that?

1087
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:46,088
Sometimes these things
just happen.

1088
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:48,242
Yeah, that's right.
They do.

1089
01:03:51,080 --> 01:03:52,206
I don't buy it.

1090
01:03:52,840 --> 01:03:53,841
[Ethan 2] All right.

1091
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:56,651
One time I read this article
on cosmic occurrences.

1092
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:58,722
I wish I still had it...
You would love it.

1093
01:03:58,840 --> 01:04:01,366
And it basically says
that aberrations happen.

1094
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:03,483
You can drive yourself nuts
trying to derive meaning

1095
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:05,881
from things that have
no meaning to begin with.

1096
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:07,766
That's so interesting.

1097
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:09,006
[Ethan 2] It is, isn't it?

1098
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:10,966
It's not that interesting.

1099
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:12,605
Let me think
of an little example for you,

1100
01:04:12,680 --> 01:04:15,843
something right up your alley.

1101
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:17,810
Um...

1102
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:19,609
Let's say you buy a gorilla.

1103
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:20,727
Excuse me?

1104
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:23,084
Let's say you buy
a gorilla, Ethan.

1105
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:25,283
You can't buy a gorilla.

1106
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:28,570
I know that,
it was for the story.

1107
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:31,325
But fine, let's say
you buy an aardvark, okay?

1108
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:35,926
You take that aardvark,
you put him in a dark room.

1109
01:04:36,120 --> 01:04:37,360
A minute later
you flip that switch,

1110
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:38,566
the lights come on.

1111
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:40,290
Now we all know
how electricity works,

1112
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:43,051
but for him
it's a miracle.

1113
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:44,760
Magic happened...

1114
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:46,769
That previously dark room
is now illuminated

1115
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:48,729
with possibilities
he's never seen before...

1116
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:50,441
And what does he do?

1117
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:52,727
Does he ruin it
by questioning how or why?

1118
01:04:54,080 --> 01:04:56,811
No. He enjoys it.

1119
01:04:58,280 --> 01:04:59,281
Huh.

1120
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:01,409
Well, I'm not an aardvark.

1121
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:04,009
And I am not a gorilla.

1122
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:09,925
Don't worry about it.
I got it.

1123
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:16,281
[sighs]

1124
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:21,121
Hmm.

1125
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:22,766
There's a little bit left.

1126
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:24,607
Should we finish it?

1127
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:42,081
[sighs] This is quite the situation.

1128
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:43,646
You can say that again.

1129
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:48,282
Has Ethan...
I mean your Ethan...

1130
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:51,486
Have you guys
talked about anything

1131
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:53,807
or has he said
anything to you at all?

1132
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:55,087
Like What?

1133
01:05:55,600 --> 01:05:58,490
Well, Ethan... My Ethan and I,
we've discussed it.

1134
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:01,611
Like he knew when I was
going to go in the house

1135
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:04,331
and I knew when he was
going to and...

1136
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:06,129
You shared your experiences.

1137
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:08,280
Yeah, for the most part.

1138
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:12,327
And you want to know
if we shared our experiences also.

1139
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:15,490
Guess I'm just curious.

1140
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:17,326
I can see that.

1141
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:21,243
You know what
I'm curious about?

1142
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:25,040
Are you more concerned
with the experiences

1143
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:27,202
that me and your Ethan shared

1144
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:29,728
or are you more concerned
with what I know

1145
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:32,360
about the experiences
that you and my Ethan shared?

1146
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:35,811
Seems to me
you care a lot more

1147
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:38,008
about one of those scenarios
than the other.

1148
01:06:41,480 --> 01:06:43,005
Are you going
to give that back?

1149
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:54,329
[sighs]

1150
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:57,723
I say for the sake of
the super fun evening

1151
01:06:57,800 --> 01:07:00,451
we're about to have,
let's keep it simple

1152
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:02,001
and keep our cheery dispositions

1153
01:07:02,120 --> 01:07:05,567
and I'll keep complimenting
your shoes.

1154
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:06,760
And you can keep pretending

1155
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:08,609
that you like the way
I pin my hair back,

1156
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:11,411
and we'll just have a good time
and see what happens.

1157
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:19,487
On second thought, do you mind
taking care of those dishes?

1158
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:26,564
You still haven't told me
where you're from.

1159
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:28,570
Are we still doing this?

1160
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:30,723
Are we going to compare
lists of women, too?

1161
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:32,604
You know, I'm starting to
piece this all together

1162
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:33,966
and see it for what it is.

1163
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:36,649
You're trying to
sabotage my relationship.

1164
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:39,971
Ethan, from what I understand
about your relationships,

1165
01:07:40,040 --> 01:07:43,249
you should be well versed
in the art of self-sabotage.

1166
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:46,050
The purpose of tonight
is not to engage

1167
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:47,889
in some warped competition
between us,

1168
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:49,885
at least not on my end.

1169
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:51,770
It wouldn't really be fair.

1170
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:54,010
Yeah? Why is that?

1171
01:07:56,760 --> 01:07:58,205
Haven't you
figured it out yet?

1172
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:01,481
[Ethan 2] It's kings.

1173
01:08:01,560 --> 01:08:03,801
It's kings or it's aces
is what's going on.

1174
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:05,609
There's something going on.

1175
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:08,047
[Sophie] Why don't you worry
about your own cards.

1176
01:08:09,040 --> 01:08:10,769
I don't even know why
we're continuing right now.

1177
01:08:10,840 --> 01:08:12,808
I basically know
every card you're holding.

1178
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:15,250
Are you saying
that I have a tell?

1179
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:16,805
You have big tells.

1180
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:19,048
[whispers indistinctly]

1181
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:20,650
You want to know
what your tell is?

1182
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:22,290
I want to know
what you think it is.

1183
01:08:22,760 --> 01:08:23,886
You have a very consistent

1184
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:25,689
albeit very cute

1185
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:28,083
Sophie shoulder shrug

1186
01:08:28,160 --> 01:08:29,605
that looks
a little bit like this.

1187
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:33,329
Oh! Do you do the shrug?

1188
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:35,320
Uh, excuse me.
Don't talk to her.

1189
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:36,521
She's dead.
She folded.

1190
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:38,011
It's just you and me now.

1191
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:39,160
You did the shoulder shrug.

1192
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:40,486
You obviously
have a good hand.

1193
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:42,921
It's like a high pair
or maybe even three of a kind.

1194
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:44,240
Fucking raise this shit, man.

1195
01:08:44,280 --> 01:08:45,520
You only live once.

1196
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:47,371
Okay. I'll raise.

1197
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:49,560
Now I know
you have the confidence.

1198
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:50,647
I have a shit hand.

1199
01:08:50,760 --> 01:08:51,921
I'm folding.
Look at that.

1200
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:53,201
Jesus, are you kidding me?

1201
01:08:53,280 --> 01:08:55,521
- What?
- You're right.

1202
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:57,922
- Pair of aces.
- Ooh!

1203
01:08:58,120 --> 01:08:59,565
Nailed it, nailed it.

1204
01:08:59,680 --> 01:09:01,569
I knew you had the aces.

1205
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:03,842
Dude, by the way, you're getting
very good at this game...

1206
01:09:03,960 --> 01:09:05,007
Almost too good.

1207
01:09:05,080 --> 01:09:07,560
I'm beginning to think this is
like one long Sophie con.

1208
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:11,244
He clearly just let you win.

1209
01:09:11,320 --> 01:09:13,288
Yes, Ethan.
Obviously he let me win.

1210
01:09:13,360 --> 01:09:14,361
Come on, guys.

1211
01:09:14,440 --> 01:09:16,160
This is supposed to just
be a friendly game.

1212
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:19,244
You're not being very fun
to play with.

1213
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:22,643
The reason he's not being fun
is because he's not even playing.

1214
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:24,000
Ethan, if you want to
win the game,

1215
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:25,570
you've got to play
some hands, okay?

1216
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,126
That's just how it works.

1217
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,570
All right.
Fine. I'll play.

1218
01:09:33,240 --> 01:09:34,446
Deal me in.
You and me.

1219
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:35,607
Come on.

1220
01:09:35,680 --> 01:09:37,170
You want to play one on...

1221
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:40,281
Okay. All right.
That's the spirit.

1222
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:41,880
Come on, buddy.
Let's get in the game.

1223
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:42,967
Let's go.

1224
01:09:46,480 --> 01:09:47,481
Mmm-hmm.

1225
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:51,766
All right.

1226
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:53,604
How many cards do you want?

1227
01:09:54,280 --> 01:09:55,320
I'm fine with what I have.

1228
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:56,646
Thank you very much.

1229
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:58,600
Sticking with what you have.

1230
01:09:58,680 --> 01:10:00,125
All right. I'll stick
with what I have, too.

1231
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:01,281
What's your move?

1232
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:05,801
I'm all in.

1233
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:07,521
Oh!

1234
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,162
All in, bold move!

1235
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:12,561
But you've got to be impulsive
sometimes. I really like it.

1236
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:14,081
All right, so you're all in,

1237
01:10:14,160 --> 01:10:17,642
and now I've got to figure out
what is your tell.

1238
01:10:18,240 --> 01:10:19,844
You've got that restless
leg thing going on

1239
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:21,570
but I think it's just nerves.

1240
01:10:21,640 --> 01:10:23,324
You've been chewing
on the lower lip a little bit,

1241
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:25,607
but I get ulcers in there, too,

1242
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:27,808
so maybe that's just
what that is.

1243
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:29,126
So weird lip...

1244
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:31,248
Oh!

1245
01:10:31,320 --> 01:10:33,527
Oh, shit!
Of course. There it is.

1246
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:38,569
The guy who has nothing
and he knows it.

1247
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:41,007
Sorry, buddy, but I've got to
call you on this one.

1248
01:10:42,040 --> 01:10:43,201
What you got?

1249
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:47,840
Whatever.

1250
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:49,487
You have nothing

1251
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:51,881
and I win with an ace high.

1252
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:53,800
Sorry about that, man.

1253
01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:56,800
It's fun playing with you, but you've
got to work on your bluffing skills.

1254
01:10:57,760 --> 01:10:58,807
You win.

1255
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:00,211
You're an amazing liar.

1256
01:11:00,360 --> 01:11:02,442
Congratulations on being a shithead.

1257
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:05,040
- Whoa!
- Ethan, Jesus. Calm down.

1258
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:06,610
Hey, wait a minute,
wait a minute.

1259
01:11:06,920 --> 01:11:08,331
I don't want to take
all the credit here.

1260
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:10,846
You're a pretty decent liar
yourself, right?

1261
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:17,810
What are you talking about?

1262
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:19,520
Do you want to tell her
or should I?

1263
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:20,681
Is this necessary?

1264
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:22,842
I think it's important that
Sophie knows what's going on.

1265
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:24,007
We're all friends here, right?

1266
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:26,526
Uh, would everybody just tell me
what we're talking about?

1267
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:27,806
What happened?

1268
01:11:27,880 --> 01:11:28,927
It's nothing.

1269
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:30,371
[Ethan 2] All right, look,

1270
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:34,568
Ethan was a little suspicious that
something was going on between us,

1271
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:37,211
so he decided to try
and figure it out for himself.

1272
01:11:37,480 --> 01:11:39,289
It was actually kind of
a brilliant move.

1273
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:40,771
He didn't go
to the grocery store.

1274
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:43,366
He ended up sneaking
into the guest house,

1275
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:45,408
and in a strange
twist of events,

1276
01:11:45,480 --> 01:11:48,962
he pretended to be me,

1277
01:11:49,080 --> 01:11:52,641
so you actually slept with Ethan
instead of me.

1278
01:11:52,760 --> 01:11:55,923
I can't fucking pretend
to be you... lam me.

1279
01:11:56,040 --> 01:11:58,042
You... What the fuck
are you talking about?

1280
01:11:58,120 --> 01:12:00,282
Just shut up!
Sophie, please.

1281
01:12:00,440 --> 01:12:01,930
That was you yesterday?

1282
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:04,965
Sweetheart...

1283
01:12:05,080 --> 01:12:08,129
[Ethan 2] Basically,
first he betrayed

1284
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:09,770
you by sleeping with someone else

1285
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:14,408
and then he kind of betrayed you
by sleeping with you.

1286
01:12:15,480 --> 01:12:19,201
Sorry, guys. I didn't want to make
like a thing here.

1287
01:12:20,120 --> 01:12:22,805
If you guys need
some space or something.

1288
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:24,809
If you want to like
take the guest house,

1289
01:12:24,920 --> 01:12:26,046
you'd be welcome.

1290
01:12:26,120 --> 01:12:27,360
I'm not going anywhere.

1291
01:12:30,720 --> 01:12:32,848
No, I want you to leave.

1292

[beeps]

1295
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:50,520
Hey. It's Ethan.

1296
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:52,523
Um, I'm really just calling
to thank you

1297
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:55,649
for your wonderful
recommendation this weekend.

1298
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:59,880
Maybe next session you can send us
to a fucking holocaust museum.

1299
01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:01,200
Thank you very much.

the keys at the exact same time.</i>

1302
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:32,406
<i>This is a strange exercise.</i>

1303
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:33,720
<i>On three, okay?</i>

1304
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:34,926
<i>One...</i>

1305
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:36,240

<i>[therapist] You met in
Scottsdale, Arizona.</i>

1308

<i>We met in
Scottsdale, Arizona.</i>

1309
01:13:51,640 --> 01:13:53,802
<i>Madison, you have
two sisters, right?</i>

1310
01:13:53,880 --> 01:13:55,405
<i>[man] Yes, two sisters.</i>

1311
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:57,409
<i>I'm the middle child,
and my dad wasn't present.</i>

1312
01:13:57,480 --> 01:13:58,527
Why are you here?

1313
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:01,080
<i>[therapist] You were raised in
a predominantly female household</i>

1315
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:10,728
Ethan and Sophie.

1316
01:14:22,440 --> 01:14:23,646
Holy shit!

1317
01:14:35,080 --> 01:14:36,491
<i>[therapist] All right.
Try it again.</i>

No, no, no, no.

No!

Help! Sophie!

Sophie, can you hear me?

Sophie, I'm stuck.

1345

[Sophie] Hey.

1346
01:16:10,520 --> 01:16:12,488
Sophie? Sophie, I'm in here.

1347
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:14,050
Sophie, I'm in here.

1348
01:16:14,120 --> 01:16:15,963
Sophie! I'm stuck.

1349
01:16:23,080 --> 01:16:25,367
[indistinct chatter]

1350
01:16:43,640 --> 01:16:44,641
[door opens]

1351
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:50,370
- What the...
- We don't have much time.

1352
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:52,442
They think I'm out
picking fruit for breakfast.

1353
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:53,681
What?

1354
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:57,643
Okay. A lot happened
last night after you left.

1355
01:16:58,240 --> 01:16:59,844
Do you know
that you're Sophie?

1356
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:00,921
Are you pretending?

1357
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:02,206
I don't know,
what's happening?

1358
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:03,321
I'm not your wife.

1359
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:05,729
Okay. What the fuck's going on,
and who are you?

1360
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:07,325
He fell in love with her.

1361
01:17:07,640 --> 01:17:09,051
He's not supposed to
fall in love with her.

1362
01:17:09,160 --> 01:17:10,764
She's supposed to fall
out of love with you.

1363
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:12,723
That's how this works.
That's how we get out.

1364
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:14,325
What the hell are you
talking about? I don't...

1365
01:17:14,440 --> 01:17:17,091
- That's how we become you.
- You become us?

1366
01:17:17,160 --> 01:17:20,004
Pitting you against each other
is the best way to break you down,

1367
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:21,491
and then
it's your turn to stay.

1368
01:17:21,560 --> 01:17:22,846
What the fu...
What the fuck?

1369
01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:24,007
Oh, my God.

1370
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:25,286
Did you try to
get out last night?

1371
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:26,486
- Yes.
- You couldn't.

1372
01:17:26,760 --> 01:17:27,761
No.

1373
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:29,640
That's because the closer
we get to moving on,

1374
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:31,682
the closer you get
to not being able to.

1375
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:33,205
Do you remember
when you first got here?

1376
01:17:33,320 --> 01:17:34,481
I was stuck here.

1377
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:36,164
You had to come see me.
Now look.

1378
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:40,567
Ethan.

1379
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:42,570
Ethan, it's not going to work.

1380
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:44,051
I have to be the one
to let you out.

1381
01:17:44,120 --> 01:17:45,880
Well, what?
I mean, what am I supposed to do?

1382
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:47,604
I don't want to be trapped here.

1383
01:17:47,680 --> 01:17:49,603
- What do you...
- You're not trapped yet.

1384
01:17:49,680 --> 01:17:51,011
I can get you out.

1385
01:17:52,160 --> 01:17:54,288
Listen, only two people
can leave today.

1386
01:17:54,480 --> 01:17:55,891
I don't understand.
Why would you help me

1387
01:17:55,960 --> 01:17:57,803
if you're trying to get
yourself out of here?

1388
01:17:57,920 --> 01:17:59,001
Because I love him.

1389
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,320
And I'd rather be trapped here
than see him leave with her.

1390
01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:08,763
So you have real feelings
like love and jealousy,

1391
01:18:08,840 --> 01:18:10,171
like a real person?

1392
01:18:11,080 --> 01:18:12,161
I am real.

1393
01:18:16,720 --> 01:18:18,324
We should bring a couple
extra bottles of water.

1394
01:18:18,440 --> 01:18:20,090
This hike can be
a little strenuous.

1395
01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:22,648
How long is the hike?

1396
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:25,088
I was just thinking I should
probably check on Ethan.

1397
01:18:25,160 --> 01:18:26,764
- See if he's okay.
- It's only like an hour.

1398
01:18:26,840 --> 01:18:29,601
Plus, I think it's good if he cools
down in the guest house, you know.

1399
01:18:30,440 --> 01:18:32,204
Hey, we're getting
ready to head out.

1400
01:18:32,280 --> 01:18:33,441
You want to get changed?

1401
01:18:33,640 --> 01:18:35,768
Well, all my clothes
are back at the guest house,

1402
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:36,841
and I agree.

1403
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:38,729
I think we should give
Ethan his space.

1404
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:40,931
I have an extra pair of shoes.

1405
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:42,883
We're probably the same size.

1406
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:45,602
Well, that's top's
really cute on you.

1407
01:18:45,720 --> 01:18:47,051
Do you have anything
like that?

1408
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:48,807
I have another one.

1409
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:52,404
Come on, girls.
Let's go.

1410
01:18:56,680 --> 01:18:58,011
They're just right in there,

1411
01:18:58,080 --> 01:19:00,401
the bottom drawer,
and there are some extra shoes.

1412
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:02,086
Great. Thanks so much.

1413
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:04,527
Sure. Do you need
anything else?

1414
01:19:04,920 --> 01:19:08,402
Um, well, my toothpaste
and toothbrush is over there.

1415
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:09,561
Do you have anything?

1416
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:11,285
Sure, I'll get you something.

1417
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:16,881
Just give me one minute, please.

1418
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:18,166
It's important.

1419
01:19:23,160 --> 01:19:24,650
Did you find
some clothes for her?

1420
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:28,285
Yep. She'll be down
in a minute.

1421
01:19:28,720 --> 01:19:29,767
Good.

1422
01:19:30,680 --> 01:19:33,729
What? Do you understand how
insane you sound right now?

1423
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:36,406
Yes, I understand, but this whole
fucking weekend has been crazy.

1424
01:19:36,520 --> 01:19:38,249
Think about it. Everything
they knew about us...

1425
01:19:38,360 --> 01:19:42,365
The missing clothes and the
phone calls to my mom and my friends.

1426
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:47,361
This entire weekend has been
one planned trap, Sophie.

1427
01:19:51,400 --> 01:19:53,971
I'm glad we have a second alone,

1428
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:56,724
because I wanted to talk to you.

1429
01:19:57,680 --> 01:19:59,045
You do, really?

1430
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:02,050
I want to talk to you, too.

1431
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:06,005
What do you want to say?

1432
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:07,891
You go first.

1433
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:12,845
I've been thinking a lot
about things.

1434
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:18,329
I don't want to leave
with Ethan.

1435
01:20:20,360 --> 01:20:22,203
I want to leave with you.

1436
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:27,448
I want to leave with you, too.

1437
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:31,924
I love you, Sophie.

1438
01:20:50,160 --> 01:20:51,810
You're not Sophie.

1439
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:54,921
Where is she?

1440
01:20:57,720 --> 01:20:58,881
Where is she?
