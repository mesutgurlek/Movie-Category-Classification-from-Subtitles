we've been way
too available.

We need to be
more coy.

Claire, do you realize

54
00:03:18,665 --> 00:03:19,962
that summer's almost over,

55
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:21,795
and you haven't gone
in the water once?

56
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:23,960
once would be
way too many times.

57
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:26,038
Mm. Excuse me.

58
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:27,231
( scoffs )

59
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,274
Doyou realize we've got
less than five days

60
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:30,637
till you
have to move?

61
00:03:30,743 --> 00:03:32,040
I don't wantyou moving

62
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:33,134

63
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:34,304

( scoffs )

65
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:37,544
I'd gone, like, a halfhour
without thinking about it.

66
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:38,617
Hailey, I'm sorry, but...

67
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:39,616
Besides,

68
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,050
I haven't kissed Raymond yet.

70
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:44,087
So I'm not going anywhere.

a sand... witch?

Cecilia's back
from camp.

81

Don't worry. He
won't fall foryuck.

82
00:04:04,477 --> 00:04:06,502
He's way too
smart for that.

CLAI RE:
She could poke an eye out.

88
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:26,261
We just... we have to decode
his body language.

89

- ( groans )
- Look, it's fine.

90
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:29,594
I mean, if
he's into her,

91
00:04:29,702 --> 00:04:31,465
he'll shake his hair,

92
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:32,663
stretch his arms

93
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:34,467
- and flex those muscles.
- Yeah?

95
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:37,301
Wha-What was that?

96
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:38,968
Fingers. That was fingers
through the hair.

97
00:04:39,078 --> 00:04:42,070
I mean, technically,
that wasn't shaking.

98
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:44,046
Right?

I can't take it anymore.

As long as he doesn't

flip his sunglasses
up and down, we're fine.

I figured you
could catch.

119

oh.

121
00:05:21,854 --> 00:05:24,584
What? Did he flip them?

122
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:25,783
You know, it's
really sunny out.

00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:18,599
Down!

169
00:07:18,704 --> 00:07:21,002
( thunder crashes in distance )

170
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:22,597
Mom, I 'm home!

171
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:24,642
MoTH ER:
Hey, kiddo!

172
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:28,111
Hailey, your boxes
won't pack themselves.

173
00:07:28,214 --> 00:07:33,516
Don't put this off
until the movers come.

174
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:38,453
( sighs )

175
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:40,219
Come on, Moby,

176
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:41,258
don't play me like that.

177
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,225
I haven't seen you in days.

178
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:46,492
Hailey, you can unpack
as much as you want.

179
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:47,566
We're still moving.

180
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:50,329
Yeah.

181
00:07:50,436 --> 00:07:51,869
( sighs )

182
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:53,165
How was the club?

183
00:07:53,272 --> 00:07:56,730
And maybe I could get more
than one syllable this time?

184
00:07:56,843 --> 00:07:58,242
- It was fine.
- Mm-hmm.

185
00:07:58,344 --> 00:07:59,504
Thatwas three.

186
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:03,673
( sighs )

187
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:06,479
I'm sorry, sweetheart,

188
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:09,419
but... you didn't want
to leave

189
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:11,717
Boston, either, remember?

190
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:13,257
And lookwhat happened.

191
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:15,759
You met Claire.

192
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:20,162
Australia could be another
amazing adventure for us, Hails.

193
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:26,032
So... how about
we start packing your room?

194
00:08:26,138 --> 00:08:27,901
So how about I live here
with Claire till I'm 1 8?

195
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:31,204
How about... we go back
to fewer syllables?

196
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:32,902
Cool.

197
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:36,414
That was one.

198
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:39,110
( groans )

199
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:44,314
REPoRTER:
A storm warning is in effect...

200
00:08:44,423 --> 00:08:47,085
HAI LEY ( giggles ):
So that's where Cecilia Banks
gets all the drama.

201
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:48,717
Just look at her dad.

202
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:50,193
BANKS:
Well, as you can see-whoa!

203
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:51,126
( laughs )

204
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,891
Hailey, how am I supposed

205
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:55,194
to face eighth grade
withoutyou?

206
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:57,633
My locker is right next
to the boys' bathroom.

207
00:08:57,737 --> 00:09:00,069
And I have coed PE class
by myself.

208
00:09:00,172 --> 00:09:02,402
We have to dance with Raymond
at The Last Splash.

209
00:09:02,508 --> 00:09:03,907
We'll be such
great dancers

210
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:05,602
that he'll realize
that he has to marry one of us.

211
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:08,111
( chuckles )
And we'll be so happy

212
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,203
that one of us got him,

213
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:11,249
that we won't even be jealous,
you know?

214
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:12,612
Unless he picks you.

215
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:13,810
That wouldn't be okay.

216
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,285
( chuckles )

217
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,754
-Joke.
- What ifthis is our last movie campout?

218
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:20,587
- What ifthis is it?
- ( grunts loudly)

219
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:26,922
o gods ofhurricanes,
makers ofthunder and lightning

220
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:29,501
and majestical waves...

221
00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:32,162
useth your power to keep my mom
from moving to Australia.

222
00:09:32,271 --> 00:09:34,933
Maketh her to see

223
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,407
and keepeth us
in Baybridge!

00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:43,474
Ameneth.

226
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:44,743
You're insane.

227
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:47,114
That's what they tell me.

228
00:09:47,219 --> 00:09:48,948
( laughing maniacally )

229
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:51,922

00:09:52,024 --> 00:09:53,457

Ameneth.

231
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:54,753

00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,164
oh, my God!

234
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,290
The vending machine's
possessed.

( Haileyscreams )

236
00:10:03,402 --> 00:10:04,835
Looks like we got free...

237
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,097
- Hailey!
-...Soda?

238
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:07,433
Where are you?
Are you dead?!.

239
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,837
- Don't die.
- I'm not dead.

240
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:10,169
I'm right here.
Follow myvoice.

241
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:11,937

( both screaming )

244
00:10:16,415 --> 00:10:18,542
I just want you to
know that if Leonard

245
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:19,481
comes in here
and chops us up

246
00:10:19,585 --> 00:10:20,916
into a million pieces,

247
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,420
that you were totally,
completely, and eternally

248

my best friend.

249

You're my best friend,

250
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,528
And I broke
your iPod.

Come on!

Grandma,
you scared me!

257
00:10:43,609 --> 00:10:45,509
Let's get the two of
you tucked up in bed.

258

No, no, no, no, no, Mr. B!

You can't- I'm sorry,
but you can't do that!

It'll be all right.

Hold on, you're okay.

308
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:35,642
There's a shark
in the pool!

You're okay, you're okay.
Shh. I got you.

00:13:41,687 --> 00:13:43,382
She may be in shock.
Take a deep breath.

Claire, are you all right?

315
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,684
She gets scared
in the water.

316
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:47,884
- Her parents drowned.

GRANDPA:
You all right, honey?

318
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:50,892
I saw something.
It's in there,

what it was!

okay, clean it, lock it. Got it.

That was, that
was tight, Ray.

327
00:14:09,815 --> 00:14:11,840
Thanks, Ray.

00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:19,985
Raymond totallyjumped
in there to save you,

331
00:14:20,092 --> 00:14:22,322
with his actual biceps.

332
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:23,690
Did you feel them
around you?

333
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:24,922
Were they flexed?

334
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,657
oh, God, they
must've been flexed.

335
00:14:26,765 --> 00:14:28,392
Ifyou had
stopped breathing!

336
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,196
You were, like, this close
to mouth-to-mouth.

337
00:14:31,303 --> 00:14:32,361
There's something
in there.

338
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:33,563
I'm serious!

339
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:35,936
It looked like...
I can't even say it,

340
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:39,738
but I swear, it just stared
at me with its eyes!

341
00:14:39,845 --> 00:14:42,939
You're in shock...
from touching Raymond!

342
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:46,540
Hailey, I know what I saw.

343
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:49,086
Fine, then we'll
just go back

344
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:51,656
when no one is looking,
and we'll check it out.

345
00:14:51,757 --> 00:14:53,224
No way, Hail.

346
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:55,691
I didn't mean to get
in the water in the first place,

347
00:14:55,794 --> 00:14:57,318
and I'm not going
back there again.

348
00:14:57,429 --> 00:14:59,590
Something bad
could've happened.

349
00:14:59,698 --> 00:15:01,131
Come on, Clairedy cat.

350
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:04,725
Put on your big girl pants
and meet me at 9:00.

351
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:11,103
( whispers ):
Be careful!

352
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:13,770
Grandpa'll be
super mad at us.

353
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:19,248
- ( door creaks )
- ( gasps ) It's Leonard.

354
00:15:30,496 --> 00:15:32,828
( quietly):
Come on.

355
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,992
( rattling, squeaking )

356
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:44,840
( rattling, squeaking )

357
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:53,313
Hey, maybe we should get
fishing poles out or something.

358
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:54,579
Shh, shh, shh. No.

359
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:55,881
I don't want to catch it.

360
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:57,455
I want to feed it.

361
00:16:06,565 --> 00:16:08,192
Fish sticks?

362
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,961
Maybe it was an octopus.

363
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:12,037
( sighs ):
With blue hair

364
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:15,868
- and a tail?
- It could've been blue seaweed

365
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,602
or kelp.

366
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,974
It was not an octopus,
and it wasn't kelp!

367
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,205
You want one?

368
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:22,371
I saw hair!

369
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:23,971
God!

370
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:25,675
Listen,

371
00:16:25,784 --> 00:16:27,479
ifyou're gonna ignore
every single word I say,

372
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:28,917
- I can hang out alone.
- I'm not ignoring you.

373
00:16:29,021 --> 00:16:31,387
( both talking at once )

374
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,515
YoUNG WoMAN:
I bet I know what it was.

375
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:35,217
( girls gasp )

376
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,790
I'm guessing...

377
00:16:39,898 --> 00:16:42,560
it was a mermaid.

378
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:47,131
Mm... mm...

379
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:49,002
( girls gasping )

380
00:16:58,684 --> 00:16:59,412
( both gasp )

381
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:01,213
( whimpering )

382
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:06,446
Boo.

383
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:08,048
( screaming )

384
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,718
( muffled gasp )

385
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:10,590
( giggles )

386
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:14,223
- ( gasps )
- It's a...

387
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:16,390
Uh, you're a...

388
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:17,366
( gasps )

389
00:17:17,469 --> 00:17:18,868
- A m...
- ( exasperated groan )

390
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:22,202
I can see we have
to take this slowly.

391
00:17:22,307 --> 00:17:25,299
Mer... maid.

392
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:26,901
Mermaid.

393
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:29,003
- ( whimpering )
- Wha...?

394
00:17:29,114 --> 00:17:31,947
Fabled marine creature,
halfwoman, halffish,

395
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,416
best known for sitting on
rocks,

396
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:36,283
staring into mirrors,
and obsessively combing

397
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:37,912
our long, beautiful hair.

398
00:17:38,023 --> 00:17:40,491
Blah, blah, blah...
( burbling )

399
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:42,924
Wha... What is going on?

400
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:46,020
- ( screaming )
- Stop shrieking

401
00:17:46,131 --> 00:17:47,860
Iike a couple of gulls.

402
00:17:49,968 --> 00:17:51,663
For shrimps,
you're awfully loud.

403
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:52,998
( chuckles )

404
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:54,333
You speak English?

405
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:57,807
Yeah. Mermaids speak every
language known to man,

406
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,468
fish, crustacean...

407
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,341
and several varieties
of sea fowl.

408
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:03,074
What can you speak?

409
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:06,515
I got a C in Spanish.

410
00:18:06,618 --> 00:18:07,482
Hmm.

411
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:08,610
( gasps ):
Wait.

412
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,416
What if she's, like,
bad or something?

413
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:13,354
( whispering ):
Whywould she be bad?

414
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:17,020
She's a fictional sea creature.
They could be bad.

415
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:18,926
We are not fictional!

416
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:20,498
We're discreet. Hm.

417
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:29,197
I've never been this
close to a human before.

418
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:32,209
( nervous chuckle ):
Yeah. Must be weird foryou.

419
00:18:36,014 --> 00:18:37,606
What?

420
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:41,208
Nothing.

421
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,948
( laughs ):
You're staring at my tail.

422
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:46,024
Well, yeah, I was.

423
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:49,356
Do you... want to touch it?

424
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:53,157
okay.

425
00:18:55,734 --> 00:18:57,201
Aah, it's slimy!

426
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:58,929
( chuckles ):
Thankyou.

427
00:18:59,037 --> 00:19:02,495
I rub it with kelp and
jellyfish twice a day. Hm.

428
00:19:02,608 --> 00:19:05,771
( majestic orchestral theme
plays )

429
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:10,475
Wow!

430
00:19:10,582 --> 00:19:11,981
Wow!

431
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:13,881
( screaming )

432
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,476
Please don't eat us!

433
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:18,215
The thought!

434
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:19,221
It's okay.

435
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:21,258
I just want to see
what feet feel like.

436
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,850
CLAI RE:
Give it!

437
00:19:23,962 --> 00:19:25,725
Can you pick things up
with them?

438
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:26,763
No, but...

439
00:19:26,865 --> 00:19:29,993
I can kickwith them
ifyou don't let go!

440
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:35,269
Hey, get back here.

441
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:37,740
( lowrumbling )

442
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,745
Mm!

443
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:45,112
How-how did you do that?

444
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:46,741
oh, that's nothing.

445
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,217
You should see my father.

446
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,878
He can make some serious waves.

447
00:19:49,988 --> 00:19:51,888
Like last night,
for example.

448
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:54,220
Your dad made those waves?

449
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:55,987
Yeah.

450
00:19:56,094 --> 00:19:58,927
He's mad at me,
because I swam away from home

451
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,862
three days before
I'm supposed to get

452
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:02,058
married offto this merman

453
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:03,691
who's about as deep
as a tidal pool.

454
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:04,928
LEoNARD:
Hey!

455
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,629
( gasps ):
Leonard! We have to go.

456
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:08,433
- He's a total psycho.
- You have to hide.

457
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,871
Wait! Where are you going?

458
00:20:09,975 --> 00:20:11,602
- We'll be back tomorrow morning.
- Promise?

459
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:12,540
Promise!

460
00:20:12,644 --> 00:20:13,702
Someone over there?

461
00:20:13,812 --> 00:20:16,178
- Run!
- Don't get seen.

462
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,115
( gasps )

463
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,931
( softsloshing )

464
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:48,011
( sighs )

465
00:20:57,389 --> 00:20:58,583
( whispers ):
Hailey.

466
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:01,352
- Hailey, wake up.
- ( moans )

467
00:21:03,895 --> 00:21:06,557
( both laughing )

468
00:21:09,368 --> 00:21:11,336
( distant whirring )

469
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:14,064
What in the world?

470
00:21:14,172 --> 00:21:16,140
- oh, no.
- oh!

471
00:21:16,241 --> 00:21:17,708
( gasps )

472
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:18,673
( gasps )

473
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:19,766
- This is bad.
- oh, my God.

474
00:21:19,878 --> 00:21:20,708
This is so bad.

475
00:21:20,812 --> 00:21:22,643
Come on.

476
00:21:22,748 --> 00:21:24,443
( machine whirring )

477
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:27,450
( whirring stops )

478
00:21:27,552 --> 00:21:29,042
What have you done?!.

479
00:21:29,154 --> 00:21:30,781
I drained the pool.

480
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:33,182
HAI LEY:
She's not in there.

481
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:36,056
- But how could she just get out?
- I don't know.

482
00:21:36,161 --> 00:21:37,128
( clattering )

483
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:38,059
Come on.

484
00:21:47,606 --> 00:21:49,369
( screaming )

485
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:51,840
- ( giggling )
- oh, it's you.

486
00:21:51,943 --> 00:21:54,070
You scared the salt out of me.

487
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:56,010
I thought you were that man

488
00:21:56,114 --> 00:21:57,979
with that awful
sucking machine.

489
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:00,847
I just about got turned
inside out.

490
00:22:00,952 --> 00:22:02,078
How did you get in here?

491
00:22:02,187 --> 00:22:03,916
I used these.

492
00:22:04,022 --> 00:22:04,647
Whoa.

493
00:22:04,756 --> 00:22:07,088
( yelps )

494
00:22:07,192 --> 00:22:08,989
( giggles )

495
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:10,994
Myvery own pair.

496
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:15,994
oh, and check this out.

497
00:22:16,101 --> 00:22:17,728
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

498
00:22:19,805 --> 00:22:21,568
Wow.

499
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:22,662
Isn't it cute?

500
00:22:22,774 --> 00:22:24,401
- ( laughs )
- Very cute.

501
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:26,500
And I can sit on it.

502
00:22:26,611 --> 00:22:27,839
( footsteps approaching )

503
00:22:27,946 --> 00:22:29,106
Hey, we've got to get you
out of here. Come on.

504
00:22:29,214 --> 00:22:30,078
You're going
to get seen.

505
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:31,206
You need to give
heryour T-shirt.

506
00:22:31,316 --> 00:22:33,807
No. My bathing suit
is like boy repellent.

507
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,079
What ifwe see Raymond?

508
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:37,178
It's your bathing suit
or her birthday suit.

509
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:38,551
Come on.

510
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:40,056
( giggling )

511
00:22:40,158 --> 00:22:42,854
( muttering )

512
00:22:45,597 --> 00:22:47,724
( giggles )

513
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:51,893
( banging,yelp )

514
00:22:52,003 --> 00:22:55,234
( banging )

515
00:22:56,908 --> 00:22:57,966
oh, no.

516
00:22:58,076 --> 00:22:59,043
That's not what you do.

517
00:22:59,144 --> 00:23:00,372
- You have to...
- No.

518
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:01,776
- Put your arms through them.
- Put your arms through the...

519
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,710
- You know what I mean?
- oh...

520
00:23:02,814 --> 00:23:03,940
No...

521
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:06,313
No, no. oh.

522
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:07,316
Wow.

523
00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:08,943
That looks amazing.

524
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:10,487
- I know.
- ( giggles )

525
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:14,090
( giggling )

526
00:23:14,192 --> 00:23:16,353
( whoops )

527
00:23:16,461 --> 00:23:19,225
( giggles )

528
00:23:20,766 --> 00:23:23,166
I don't understand
how you can sleep on these

529
00:23:23,268 --> 00:23:25,065
when they're so jumpy.

530
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:27,070
I could just do this all day.

531
00:23:27,172 --> 00:23:29,140
GRANDMA:
Claire, what on earth
are you doing up there?

532
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:32,335
( mermaid whoops,
Haileylaughs )

533
00:23:32,444 --> 00:23:33,775
You really need to stop.

534
00:23:33,879 --> 00:23:35,312
Gram's gonna be
really mad at us.

535
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:36,403
( whoops )

536
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:38,449
We're gonna get in huge trouble.

537
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:40,108
You worry too much.

538
00:23:40,218 --> 00:23:41,150
I rest my case.

539
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:42,015
( scoffs )

540
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,178
This is so much fun.

541
00:23:43,288 --> 00:23:44,255
( whoops )

542
00:23:44,356 --> 00:23:47,086
oh! I love legs.

543
00:23:47,192 --> 00:23:48,318
CLAI RE:
So...

544
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:50,520
do you get to keep them?

545
00:23:50,629 --> 00:23:52,790
Technically, we can only have
legs when the sun's out.

546
00:23:52,898 --> 00:23:54,525
And we have to keep them dry,

547
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:56,032
or at least that's
what I've heard.

548
00:23:56,134 --> 00:23:58,261
I've never had the guts
to come out and try them.

549
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:00,463
So this is your
first time ashore?

550
00:24:00,572 --> 00:24:03,006
First time on land,
first time with legs.

551
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:04,575
Can you believe it?

552
00:24:04,676 --> 00:24:06,007
oh, you'd never know.

553
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:08,443
But I've got
to be careful.

554
00:24:08,547 --> 00:24:10,447
Add moonlight or
water, instant tail.

555
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:12,039
Lookwhat I can do. Eh!

556
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:14,812
( laughs ):
ow. Stop that.

557
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,046
( burbledringing )

558
00:24:16,154 --> 00:24:17,553
- Hmm?
- Hmm?

559
00:24:17,656 --> 00:24:19,351
( burbledringing )

560
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:20,891
( groans )

561
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:22,721
oh! Crabs!

562
00:24:22,828 --> 00:24:24,056
They found me.

563
00:24:24,162 --> 00:24:25,322
With a shell?

564
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:26,556
Mm-hmm.

565
00:24:26,665 --> 00:24:29,793
Did you know you can hear
the ocean through these?

566
00:24:29,901 --> 00:24:31,198
Yeah, but...

567
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:33,237
Well, it works both ways.

568
00:24:33,338 --> 00:24:35,568
The ocean can hearyou, too.

569
00:24:36,908 --> 00:24:38,500
Hello? Dad?

570
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:41,636
( gurgling ):
Aquamarine!Just what do
you thinkyou're doing?!.

571
00:24:41,746 --> 00:24:42,838
Daddy?

572
00:24:42,948 --> 00:24:44,313
Shell phone.

573
00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:45,815
( gurgledyelling continues )

574
00:24:45,917 --> 00:24:47,043
Could you give me a minute?

575
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:48,779
Sure. Sorry.

576
00:24:48,887 --> 00:24:50,081
AQUAMARI NE:
Well, that's your plan,

577
00:24:50,188 --> 00:24:51,246
- not mine.
- okay.

578
00:24:51,356 --> 00:24:54,655
I don't want to marry
some spoiled, rich, squid!

579
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:56,283
( gurgledyelling on phone )

580
00:24:56,394 --> 00:24:58,225
Well, you can make
all the storms you want,

581
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,025
but I'm not coming back.

582
00:25:00,131 --> 00:25:01,530
- ( thunder crashing )
- ( gurgledyelling )

583
00:25:01,633 --> 00:25:03,225
No! No!

584
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:05,428
Love is not a myth,
Daddy, it's real!

585
00:25:05,537 --> 00:25:06,595
You think her dad
is doing this?

586
00:25:06,705 --> 00:25:08,570
...three days,
I'll prove it to you.

587
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:10,106
( gurgled ):
Ifyou don't come back
in three days...

588
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:12,039
Well, ifI'm wrong,
then I will honoryour plans.

589
00:25:12,143 --> 00:25:13,508
And I'll call you every night,
okay?

590
00:25:13,612 --> 00:25:14,874
So calm down!

591
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,413
( frustratedgroan )

592
00:25:20,218 --> 00:25:21,981
( Aquamarine groans )

593
00:25:23,622 --> 00:25:25,112
I have to find love.

594
00:25:25,223 --> 00:25:26,315
We don't have it where I'm from,

595
00:25:26,424 --> 00:25:28,119
and if I can't find it

596
00:25:28,226 --> 00:25:30,490
in three days, I'm sunk.

597
00:25:30,595 --> 00:25:31,619
You don't have love?

598
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:32,697
No.

599
00:25:32,797 --> 00:25:34,321
My dad says it's just a myth.

600
00:25:34,432 --> 00:25:36,127
We marrywho our parents pick.

601
00:25:36,234 --> 00:25:37,701
And my dad thinks
that I have bubbles in my brain

602
00:25:37,802 --> 00:25:39,793
because I believe in love.

603
00:25:39,905 --> 00:25:41,463
He says that the onlyway

604
00:25:41,573 --> 00:25:43,473
I can get out of mywedding

605
00:25:43,575 --> 00:25:45,372
is ifl can prove to him
that love exists.

606
00:25:45,477 --> 00:25:47,377
But that means
I only get three days.

607
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:50,209
or else I'll be swimming
down the aisle with that...

608
00:25:50,315 --> 00:25:52,681
( shudders )... that blowfish.

609
00:25:52,784 --> 00:25:53,910
But ifyou
don't have love,

610
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:55,281
how doyou know it exists?

611
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:56,354
I saw it once.

612
00:25:56,454 --> 00:25:58,888
- And I want it.
- ( Raywhooping )

613
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:00,981
Yeah!

614
00:26:01,092 --> 00:26:02,491
( grunts )

615
00:26:02,594 --> 00:26:04,061
With him.

616
00:26:04,162 --> 00:26:07,620
( man singing )

617
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:10,223
( driving rock beat plays )

618
00:26:14,506 --> 00:26:15,165
Raymond?!.

619
00:26:15,273 --> 00:26:16,740
RAY:
Whoo! Check it out!

620
00:26:17,943 --> 00:26:19,433
- Raymond?
- ( groans )

621
00:26:19,544 --> 00:26:21,409
Raymond.

622
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:29,747
( singing continues )

623
00:26:29,854 --> 00:26:31,082
( sighs )

624
00:26:31,189 --> 00:26:33,589
Raymond is the one I love.

625
00:26:33,692 --> 00:26:35,557
- No!
- No!

626
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:38,686
- No...!
- No...!

627
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:41,731
( grunts )

628
00:26:41,833 --> 00:26:43,323
Raymond!

629
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:44,663
Raymond!

630
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:45,929
Raymond!

631
00:26:46,037 --> 00:26:48,437
- Yeah?
- Hi.

632
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:49,666
Hi.

633
00:26:50,976 --> 00:26:53,706
Do you love me?

634
00:26:54,813 --> 00:26:57,680
Uh... no,

635
00:26:57,782 --> 00:26:59,716
but I thinkyou're hot.

636
00:26:59,818 --> 00:27:01,285
You're really hot.

637
00:27:01,386 --> 00:27:02,478
Come on, man.
We got to go!

638
00:27:02,587 --> 00:27:03,884
The beach house
is going off!.

639
00:27:03,989 --> 00:27:05,718
Yeah, I know, I know, I know.

640
00:27:05,824 --> 00:27:08,224
Well, uh, I'll seeyou later.

641
00:27:08,326 --> 00:27:10,658
Come on. Come on,
come on, come on!

642
00:27:10,762 --> 00:27:13,162
( grunts ):
Hey, man.

643
00:27:13,264 --> 00:27:16,097
- Drop me off at home. Can you?
- ( mermaidgrunts weakly)

644
00:27:19,838 --> 00:27:21,430
He doesn't love me?

645
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:24,565
How can he not love me?

646
00:27:24,676 --> 00:27:25,734
( groans )
I need some salt.

647
00:27:25,844 --> 00:27:27,038
- What did you say?
- What did he say?

648
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:28,373
He said I was hot,

649
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,744
but how would he know?

650
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:32,214
Do I feel hot to you?

651
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:33,682
( both giggling )

652
00:27:33,785 --> 00:27:35,946
- No. That is not how you...
- I think that you mistook it.

653
00:27:36,054 --> 00:27:38,215
You have to help me get him
to fall in love with me.

654
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:39,551
Yeah, right!

655
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:40,955
No, no, no.
No, Raymond's way too popular.

656
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:42,321
You should pick someone else.

657
00:27:42,427 --> 00:27:43,894
I mean, all the girls
are after him.

658
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:46,088
- Even a few boys.
- Right.

659
00:27:46,197 --> 00:27:47,562
Fine.

660
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:49,634
Then you don't getyourwish.

661
00:27:49,734 --> 00:27:51,133

662
00:27:51,236 --> 00:27:52,362
Wait, wait, what?

663
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:54,370
What wish?

664
00:27:54,472 --> 00:27:57,669
You know, ifyou help a
mermaid, you get a wish.

665
00:27:57,776 --> 00:27:59,710
Anywish
you could wish for.

666
00:27:59,811 --> 00:28:01,438
I thought that was genies.

667
00:28:01,546 --> 00:28:02,877
( laughs )

668
00:28:02,981 --> 00:28:05,040
You... you believe in genies?

669
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:09,183
Uh... what if ourwish

670
00:28:09,287 --> 00:28:11,380
involves other people?

671
00:28:11,489 --> 00:28:13,616
- Like my mom.
- Yeah.

672
00:28:13,725 --> 00:28:16,057
It's a wish, anywish,

673
00:28:16,161 --> 00:28:18,356
as long as it doesn't
violate the laws of nature.

674
00:28:18,463 --> 00:28:19,395
Mm, mm, mm-hmm.

sacrifice for us.

But he has to say he loves me,

688
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:45,955
'cause I need proof
for my dad.

( sighs )

693
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,663
My name's Aquamarine.

Now, let's go find Raymond.

( laughter continues )

699
00:29:05,677 --> 00:29:07,076
You need shoes!

00:29:07,178 --> 00:29:10,113
Yeah, and undies!

701
00:29:10,215 --> 00:29:12,581

707
00:29:42,046 --> 00:29:43,240
My mom collects
this stuff.

708
00:29:43,348 --> 00:29:44,610
What does your mom do?

709
00:29:44,716 --> 00:29:45,944
Besides ruin my life?

710
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:47,381
She's a marine biologist.

711
00:29:47,485 --> 00:29:48,611
CLAI RE:

713
00:29:50,088 --> 00:29:51,851
She's dragged me all over
the country for herjob.

714
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:54,151
She's been working to clean up
the water in the bay here.

715
00:29:54,259 --> 00:29:56,318
Well, tell her thanks for me

716
00:29:56,427 --> 00:29:58,019
because it tastes
about ten times better

717
00:29:58,129 --> 00:29:59,460
than it did a fewyears ago.

718
00:29:59,564 --> 00:30:01,122

00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:06,661
Uh, Aqua, what areyou doing?

722
00:30:06,771 --> 00:30:09,399
He doesn't like
this harsh light.

723
00:30:13,178 --> 00:30:14,839
HAI LEY:

CLAI RE:

728
00:30:21,452 --> 00:30:23,044
All right.

729
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:25,315
We begin where every girl
starts with her first crush.

730
00:30:25,423 --> 00:30:27,550
- We call him.
- ( dial tone )

731
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:29,559
Call him? What?

732

What? No, I can't.

733
00:30:30,795 --> 00:30:32,092
What am I supposed
to say to him?

734
00:30:32,197 --> 00:30:33,221
Nothing.

735
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:34,355
We just call and hang up.

736
00:30:34,465 --> 00:30:35,557
We do it all the time.

737
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:36,725
Why?

738
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,063

( keys beeping )

742
00:30:43,141 --> 00:30:45,371
Wait a minute.

744
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:47,872

okay, the next step
here is the ride-by.

753
00:31:06,231 --> 00:31:07,220
Very important
in any crush.

754
00:31:07,332 --> 00:31:09,857
Now remember,
you have to act casual.

755
00:31:09,968 --> 00:31:13,460
Yes, like you didn't even
remember this was his street.

But this will be worth it.

She thinks she's the shiz

Her dad can

( laughs ):
No. He just reports it.

Just a royal bitch.

827
00:34:04,442 --> 00:34:06,535
Then why are you
so intimidated?

828
00:34:06,644 --> 00:34:08,805
oh. Got it. Slow...

829
00:34:09,914 --> 00:34:12,246
( pop music continues )

830
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:13,647
Whoa.

831
00:34:15,019 --> 00:34:16,077
Hey, guys,

832
00:34:16,187 --> 00:34:18,121
does she have something
against girl's clothes?

833
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:20,383
( Cecilia's friends laughing )

834
00:34:20,491 --> 00:34:22,482

00:34:22,593 --> 00:34:24,493
CECI LIA:
Nice hair.

836
00:34:24,595 --> 00:34:25,619
Who are you?

837
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:26,697
Aquamarine.

838
00:34:26,798 --> 00:34:27,890
She's my cousin.

839
00:34:27,999 --> 00:34:29,523
Well, that's
kind of pretty.

840
00:34:29,634 --> 00:34:32,626
Mm! For a crayon.

841
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:35,535
I was named Aquamarine after
a rare and precious gemstone,

842
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:36,800
whereas...

843
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:40,241
Cecilia translated
means "dim-sighted."

844
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:43,744
Butyour parents know
you better than I do.

845
00:34:43,848 --> 00:34:44,974
Wow.

846
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:46,812
What did you just say to me?

847
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:50,615
Yep, definitely dim-sighted.

848
00:34:50,721 --> 00:34:52,188
( engine booms andstalls )

849
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:55,589

( laughter continues )

852
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:03,330
There's something very fishy
about that girl.

CLAI RE:
Cecilia Banks blew a gasket!

854
00:35:05,903 --> 00:35:07,530
Who cares about her?
What about Ray?

855
00:35:07,638 --> 00:35:08,764
I mean...

856
00:35:08,873 --> 00:35:10,238
( panting )

857
00:35:10,341 --> 00:35:12,275
What happened to me back there?

858
00:35:12,376 --> 00:35:13,843
I was such a clam.

859
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:15,071
I-I couldn't think.

CLAI RE:
Don't worry.

861
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:18,445
Everything we've learned

862
00:35:18,549 --> 00:35:21,382
has come from the pages
ofthese magazines.

Come on.

AQUAMARI NE:
I can't stop thinking about him.

865
00:35:24,722 --> 00:35:28,317

- Look at my finger scales.

868
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:34,195
oh, my.

869
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:36,129
They've never been
this color before.

870
00:35:36,234 --> 00:35:37,861
They change colorwith my mood.

871
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:38,993
Whoa, weird.

872
00:35:39,103 --> 00:35:40,798
But I don't know
what mood this is.

873
00:35:40,905 --> 00:35:43,874
- Love...
- Love...

HAI LEY:
okay, start reading.

876
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:49,239
Mm-hmm.

877

879
00:36:04,462 --> 00:36:06,191
Look at this!

880
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,559

( frustrated grunt )

How do you remember
all this?

885
00:36:33,591 --> 00:36:36,185
You have to be flirty,
but demure.

886
00:36:36,294 --> 00:36:37,454
Yeah.

887

- Devoted but not desperate.
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

- It's so annoying.
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

893
00:36:48,906 --> 00:36:51,466
Yet strangely addictive.

894

Sorry. I just got so excited,

992
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:37,189
dead set on me starting college
next week.

993
00:40:37,296 --> 00:40:39,662
But, I don't know, I want
to take a year off and travel.

994
00:40:39,765 --> 00:40:41,892
I've never been
out of Florida.

995
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,560
So we've been arguing about it
all summer.

996
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:46,297
And he'll probably
win the argument.

997
00:40:46,405 --> 00:40:47,429
He always does.

998
00:40:49,007 --> 00:40:50,269
Theyjust don't
get it, do they?

999
00:40:50,375 --> 00:40:51,637
Sometimes you have
to leave home

1000
00:40:51,743 --> 00:40:52,801
to figure out
whatyou want.

1001
00:40:52,911 --> 00:40:54,845
Exactly.

1002
00:40:56,782 --> 00:41:00,684
You know, you're not like
most girls around here.

1003
00:41:00,786 --> 00:41:03,016
( quiet, anxious squeak )

1004
00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:06,414
CLAI RE:
They're so cute together.

1005
00:41:06,525 --> 00:41:08,288
HAI LEY:
Claire, how romantic is that?

1006
00:41:08,393 --> 00:41:09,917
( Claire laughs )

1007
00:41:10,028 --> 00:41:11,086
This is nice.

1008
00:41:12,297 --> 00:41:14,697
The sun is setting!

1009
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:15,960
Yeah, I know.

1010
00:41:16,068 --> 00:41:17,535
We timed it prettywell,
didn't we?

1011
00:41:17,636 --> 00:41:19,866
- I have to get back!
- What? okay.

1012
00:41:19,972 --> 00:41:21,098
Uh...

1013
00:41:22,808 --> 00:41:23,968
okay. All right.

1014
00:41:24,076 --> 00:41:25,304
- okay, all right...
- oh, no!

1015
00:41:25,410 --> 00:41:26,308
We're going
the wrong way!

1016
00:41:26,411 --> 00:41:27,639
We're heading
back out to sea!

1017
00:41:27,746 --> 00:41:29,145
There we go,
we're turning around.

1018
00:41:29,248 --> 00:41:31,341
Yeah, we're turning around,
everything's okay...

1019
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:32,781
Hailey! Claire!

1020
00:41:32,884 --> 00:41:35,114
- Sunset!
- oh, no!

1021

CLAI RE:
She's gonna pop a tail!

1022
00:41:36,555 --> 00:41:38,318

AQUAMARI NE:

RAYMoND:
Hey, hey...

1025

Like, um... what areyou doing
tomorrow night?

1028
00:41:49,234 --> 00:41:51,498
You've probably heard
about the Last Splash?

1029
00:41:51,603 --> 00:41:52,535
- We're coming, Aqua!
- Paddle!

1030
00:41:52,638 --> 00:41:54,538
It's a...
a party type thing.

1031
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:55,937
Wow, you're really
in a hurry.

1032
00:41:56,041 --> 00:41:57,338
It's notyour fault.
I just...

1033
00:41:57,442 --> 00:41:59,171
I have to be somewhere.

1034
00:41:59,278 --> 00:42:00,802
oh.

1035
00:42:00,912 --> 00:42:02,743
Hey, you've got
to help our friend!

1036
00:42:02,848 --> 00:42:04,145
She's really sick.
She's got...

1037
00:42:04,249 --> 00:42:06,809
- Hydrophobia! Yeah.

1038
00:42:06,918 --> 00:42:08,408

1039
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:11,250
CLAI RE:

Come on, you're almost there.
You're almost there.

1045
00:42:18,330 --> 00:42:19,194
Pardon me. Excuse me.

1046
00:42:19,298 --> 00:42:21,664
- Sorry. Pardon me.

1047
00:42:21,767 --> 00:42:22,392
Hey!

Let's go, let's go!

1049
00:42:23,635 --> 00:42:24,499
Keep going!
Don't stop!

1050
00:42:24,603 --> 00:42:26,161
CLAI RE:
Bikes around the corner!

1051
00:42:26,271 --> 00:42:27,260
Run!

1052
00:42:27,372 --> 00:42:29,499
- I'm sorry!
- Let's go!

1053
00:42:29,608 --> 00:42:30,905
It was so much fun.

1054
00:42:31,009 --> 00:42:33,409
CLAI RE: Aqua, go, go!
We gotta get you back!

1055
00:42:37,849 --> 00:42:40,682
I'll be right back.

1056
00:42:40,786 --> 00:42:42,583
Hey, Ray.

1057
00:42:42,688 --> 00:42:44,280
That was too close.

1058
00:42:44,389 --> 00:42:46,414
I need some water
to spend the night in.

1059
00:42:46,525 --> 00:42:47,355
How about the ocean?

1060
00:42:47,459 --> 00:42:48,858
No. No ocean-
my fatherwould just

1061
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,053
manipulate the currents
and pull me back home.

1062
00:42:51,163 --> 00:42:53,188
I know a place.

1063
00:42:56,335 --> 00:42:58,565

- Claire, you doing this?
- Uh-uh.

1068
00:43:09,414 --> 00:43:11,041
Aren't you coming?

1069
00:43:11,149 --> 00:43:12,514
I-I don't do water.

1070
00:43:12,617 --> 00:43:14,778
on the ground or in the air.

1071
00:43:14,886 --> 00:43:16,547
Raymond was about
to kiss you

1072
00:43:16,655 --> 00:43:18,987
with his actual lips!
( grunts )

1073
00:43:19,091 --> 00:43:21,218
Stupid sun!

1074
00:43:21,326 --> 00:43:22,293
HAI LEY:
Did Ray say anything?

1075
00:43:22,394 --> 00:43:24,419
He asked ifl heard
of Last Splash.

1076
00:43:24,529 --> 00:43:26,121
- What?!.
- What?!.

1077
00:43:26,231 --> 00:43:27,630
Exactlywhat did he say?

1078
00:43:27,733 --> 00:43:29,257
Uh...

1079
00:43:29,368 --> 00:43:31,268
I can't remember.

1080
00:43:31,370 --> 00:43:34,635
So was it "Areyou going?"
or "Will you go with me?"

1081
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:36,571
- Is there a difference?
- Huge.

1082
00:43:36,675 --> 00:43:37,437
- Major.
- okay,

1083
00:43:37,542 --> 00:43:40,102
well, it started with...

1084
00:43:40,212 --> 00:43:42,180
"What areyou doing
tomorrow night?"

1085
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:44,646
- oh, my God!
- oh, my God, he was totally
asking you out

1086
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:45,910
- on a date!
- He was?

1087
00:43:46,017 --> 00:43:47,109
Absolutely.

1088
00:43:47,219 --> 00:43:48,243
Yes! ( whoops )

1089
00:43:48,353 --> 00:43:49,650
( laughter)

1090
00:43:49,755 --> 00:43:51,086

Thanks.

00:43:58,296 --> 00:44:00,025
Sure.

1095
00:44:05,904 --> 00:44:07,701
AQUAMARI N E:
Why won't Claire come with us?

1096
00:44:07,806 --> 00:44:09,205
HAI LEY:
She's not good around water.

1097
00:44:09,307 --> 00:44:12,037
- It's kind of a long story.
- Hm.

1098
00:44:17,382 --> 00:44:18,474
HAI LEY:
Wow...

1099
00:44:18,583 --> 00:44:20,483
I wish I could hide out here
with you.

Wow.

( chuckles )

1109
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:03,349
I almost forgot.

1110
00:45:03,462 --> 00:45:05,191
Me, too.

1111
00:45:05,297 --> 00:45:06,787

1112
00:45:06,898 --> 00:45:08,024
This is nice.

Good.

1114
00:45:09,334 --> 00:45:11,598
Are you gonna be okay in here?

1115
00:45:11,703 --> 00:45:14,900
( chuckles ):
Are you gonna be okay out there?

1116
00:45:15,006 --> 00:45:16,064
Mm?

1117
00:45:16,174 --> 00:45:17,266
( chuckles )

1118
00:45:18,677 --> 00:45:20,406

I heard that!
( laughs )

1121
00:45:24,483 --> 00:45:26,678
HAI LEY:
I never realized how big

1122
00:45:26,785 --> 00:45:27,877
this room was.

1123
00:45:27,986 --> 00:45:29,920
Without all my
stuff in it.

1124
00:45:30,021 --> 00:45:32,455
I want this wish so bad, Claire.

- Claire?
- Hm?

1127
00:45:38,396 --> 00:45:41,024
Doyou think he'll fall
in actual love with her,

1128
00:45:41,132 --> 00:45:43,191
in two days?

1129
00:45:43,301 --> 00:45:45,064
He has to.

1130
00:45:45,170 --> 00:45:47,138
I-It's her last hope.

1131

1132
00:45:51,676 --> 00:45:53,007
Hailey?

1133
00:45:53,111 --> 00:45:55,238
- What?
- We completely forgot something.

1134
00:45:55,347 --> 00:45:57,872
What's Aqua gonna wear
to the Last Splash?

1135
00:45:57,983 --> 00:45:59,109
I mean, she can't

1136
00:45:59,217 --> 00:46:01,310
keep wearing yourT-shirts.
No offense.

1137
00:46:01,419 --> 00:46:02,443
Hey, hey.

1138
00:46:02,554 --> 00:46:04,317
We'll take the first bus
into Tampa tomorrow,

1139
00:46:04,422 --> 00:46:05,411
and we'll go shopping.

1140
00:46:05,524 --> 00:46:08,093
- Wha...? No. We can't!
- No, we have to.

1141
00:46:08,159 --> 00:46:11,356
Besides, I have $400 saved up
from working at the aquarium.

1142
00:46:11,463 --> 00:46:13,556
Doyou know how much trouble
we'll be in?

1143
00:46:13,665 --> 00:46:15,223
Come on, Clairedy cat.

1144
00:46:15,333 --> 00:46:16,322

( Aquamarine laughs )

1150
00:46:42,327 --> 00:46:43,351
What?

1151
00:46:43,461 --> 00:46:46,362
Why go through life
unnoticed?

1152
00:46:46,464 --> 00:46:48,091
( anxious whimper )

1153
00:46:48,199 --> 00:46:50,667
( music continues )

1154
00:46:50,769 --> 00:46:52,361
( camera shutter clicks )

1155
00:46:52,470 --> 00:46:53,459
( laughs )

1156
00:46:53,572 --> 00:46:54,470
( gasps )

1157
00:46:54,573 --> 00:46:56,165
- Aqua!
- This store is hideous!

1158
00:46:56,274 --> 00:46:59,004
This store is
for old people!

1159
00:47:00,045 --> 00:47:01,842
- Yeah.
- No, no.

1160
00:47:01,947 --> 00:47:02,777
( shutter clicks )

1161
00:47:02,881 --> 00:47:04,678
This store is
kind of lame.

1162
00:47:04,783 --> 00:47:06,683
- It's all used stuff.
- oh, come on, you guys.

1163
00:47:06,785 --> 00:47:08,047
It's so different
from anything else

1164
00:47:08,153 --> 00:47:09,381
we saw at the mall.

1165
00:47:09,487 --> 00:47:11,216
Come on,just give it a chance.

1166
00:47:13,158 --> 00:47:14,716
( laughing )

1167
00:47:20,298 --> 00:47:21,287
Hey, you guys.

1168
00:47:21,399 --> 00:47:23,333
Hm, hm, hm?

1169
00:47:25,470 --> 00:47:27,131
It's old-fashioned,
but I think it works.

1170
00:47:27,238 --> 00:47:27,897
I don't know.

1171
00:47:28,006 --> 00:47:29,667
I love vintage.

1172
00:47:29,774 --> 00:47:32,902
( laughs ):
Look at these sleeves!

1173
00:47:33,011 --> 00:47:34,205
Mm.

1174
00:47:36,948 --> 00:47:37,915
( laughter)

1175
00:47:39,851 --> 00:47:41,318
( gasps, screams )

1176
00:47:41,419 --> 00:47:42,716
ow, ow...

1177
00:47:42,821 --> 00:47:43,719
Sorry.

1178
00:48:03,408 --> 00:48:05,706
( laughing,
conversing indistinctly )

1179
00:48:12,283 --> 00:48:14,979
okay, we've got three
hours till Last Splash,

1180
00:48:15,086 --> 00:48:16,781
so, uh, a quick review?

1181
00:48:16,888 --> 00:48:18,219
Dresses: check.

1182
00:48:18,323 --> 00:48:20,018
Blue highlights:
big check.

1183
00:48:20,125 --> 00:48:21,490
Are we missing
anything?

1184
00:48:21,593 --> 00:48:24,653
( gasps ):
Wait. I don't have earrings!

1185
00:48:24,763 --> 00:48:26,628
How could I not
have earrings?

1186
00:48:26,731 --> 00:48:28,392
I have earrings.
Don't worry.

1187
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:30,491
( Aquamarine whimpers )

1188
00:48:33,004 --> 00:48:34,733
Hm. Pretty.

1189
00:48:34,839 --> 00:48:36,773
And... pointy?

1190
00:48:36,875 --> 00:48:39,605
( laughs ): What am I
supposed to do with this?

1191
00:48:39,711 --> 00:48:41,702
Like, stick it through my skin?

1192
00:48:41,813 --> 00:48:42,711
( Haileylaughs )

1193
00:48:42,814 --> 00:48:43,712
That's what you do.

1194
00:48:43,815 --> 00:48:45,442
Ugh!

1195
00:48:45,550 --> 00:48:46,710
You're so primitive.

1196
00:48:46,818 --> 00:48:47,910
I wear stick-ons.

1197
00:48:48,019 --> 00:48:48,951
You mean, clip-ons?

1198
00:48:49,054 --> 00:48:50,885
No.

1199
00:48:51,923 --> 00:48:53,390
You'll love these.

1200
00:48:53,491 --> 00:48:55,118
They're my favorite
aquatic accessory.

1201
00:48:55,226 --> 00:48:57,126
You see that buoy
out there?

1202
00:48:57,228 --> 00:48:59,219
I need you to swim out there
and find me a couple

1203
00:48:59,330 --> 00:49:00,729
of starfish about...

1204
00:49:00,832 --> 00:49:02,959
mmm, this big.

1205
00:49:03,068 --> 00:49:04,126
Live starfish?

1206
00:49:04,235 --> 00:49:05,998
That's whatyou wear
for earrings?

1207
00:49:06,104 --> 00:49:07,435
They compliment me.

1208
00:49:07,539 --> 00:49:09,370
Seriously, Aqua,
I've got some earrings

1209
00:49:09,474 --> 00:49:10,998
that'll complement
you just fine.

1210
00:49:11,109 --> 00:49:14,101
No. I mean, they literally
give me compliments.

1211
00:49:14,212 --> 00:49:15,736
- In my ear. They talk to me.
- Huh? Huh?

1212
00:49:15,847 --> 00:49:18,839
Starfish are notorious suck-ups.

1213
00:49:18,950 --> 00:49:20,918
They love
to give compliments.

1214
00:49:21,019 --> 00:49:22,281
But it's nice

1215
00:49:22,387 --> 00:49:23,854
when you need a little boost.

1216
00:49:23,955 --> 00:49:24,853
- ( buoybell clangs )
- okay, guys,

1217
00:49:24,956 --> 00:49:26,048
Iet's go.

1218
00:49:26,157 --> 00:49:27,852
Hailey, I can't.

1219
00:49:27,959 --> 00:49:29,358
You've got to do this.

1220
00:49:29,461 --> 00:49:32,294
Do you see how far
that buoy is? No.

1221
00:49:32,397 --> 00:49:35,298
Don't worry about it.
I'll get you a ride.

1222
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:36,628
( whistles )

1223
00:49:36,735 --> 00:49:38,930
- ( bell clanging )
- ( continues whistling )

1224
00:49:39,037 --> 00:49:41,164
( muffled whistling )

1225
00:49:50,982 --> 00:49:52,643
No way!

1226
00:49:52,751 --> 00:49:54,275
( Hailey laughs )

1227
00:49:54,385 --> 00:49:55,545
Wow...

1228
00:49:55,653 --> 00:49:56,551
oh!

1229
00:49:56,654 --> 00:49:58,781
- Hi!
- ( dolphins chattering )

1230
00:49:58,890 --> 00:50:00,118
Hi, guys!

1231
00:50:01,926 --> 00:50:02,722
oh!

1232
00:50:02,827 --> 00:50:04,124
Watch the legs, guys!

1233
00:50:04,229 --> 00:50:05,321
( laughing )

1234
00:50:05,430 --> 00:50:07,295
- Claire, look at that!
- Hi!

1235
00:50:07,398 --> 00:50:08,695
- Hi.
- oh, my goodness.

1236
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:11,325
Claire, you have to do this
with me.

1237
00:50:11,436 --> 00:50:13,404
( squeaky chattering )

1238
00:50:15,473 --> 00:50:16,872
You go.

1239
00:50:16,975 --> 00:50:18,465
Have fun.

1240
00:50:18,576 --> 00:50:21,636
okay. All right.

1241
00:50:21,746 --> 00:50:23,338
( squeaky chattering )

1242
00:50:27,152 --> 00:50:29,143
Are you sure?

1243
00:50:29,254 --> 00:50:31,882
Yeah. ( laughs )

1244
00:50:31,990 --> 00:50:33,582
( laughs )

1245
00:50:33,691 --> 00:50:35,886
( shudders ):
Ah...

1246
00:50:37,262 --> 00:50:38,991
( laughs )

1247
00:50:44,235 --> 00:50:47,500
( Hailey gasps, yells )

1248
00:50:47,605 --> 00:50:48,902
Claire! Look at me!

1249
00:50:49,007 --> 00:50:52,238
CLAI RE:
Whoo-hoo! Way to go, Hail!

1250
00:50:55,013 --> 00:50:56,947
( laughing, gasping )

1251
00:51:02,687 --> 00:51:03,654
Hailey!

1252
00:51:03,755 --> 00:51:05,985
Hi, guys!

1253
00:51:06,090 --> 00:51:08,581
Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo!

1254
00:51:08,693 --> 00:51:11,025
( exhales ):
Don't you just...

1255
00:51:11,129 --> 00:51:13,120
Iove love?

1256
00:51:15,333 --> 00:51:16,265
What?

1257
00:51:16,367 --> 00:51:18,995
It's just...

1258
00:51:19,103 --> 00:51:21,469
you're so sure
ofyourself.

1259
00:51:21,573 --> 00:51:23,666
Well, I've only seen love
up close once,

1260
00:51:23,775 --> 00:51:25,868
but ifyou'd seen it
the way I did,

1261
00:51:25,977 --> 00:51:27,239
you'd feel the same way.

1262
00:51:27,345 --> 00:51:30,280
Why? What was it like?

1263
00:51:30,381 --> 00:51:31,643
It was years ago.

1264
00:51:31,749 --> 00:51:34,411
Not too far from here,
actually.

1265
00:51:34,519 --> 00:51:36,487
We were migrating
through the bay,

1266
00:51:36,588 --> 00:51:39,284
just like we always do
this time ofyear, and...

1267
00:51:39,390 --> 00:51:43,588
I saw this couple out sailing
on their little blue boat,

1268
00:51:43,695 --> 00:51:47,222
and thewaythey looked
at each other,

1269
00:51:47,332 --> 00:51:51,792
it was a look I'd never seen
anywhere else in the seven seas.

1270
00:51:51,903 --> 00:51:55,430
I've wanted someone to look
at me that way ever since.

1271
00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:59,670
I looked for them everyyear,
but I never saw them again.

1272
00:51:59,777 --> 00:52:02,940
Was there a name...
on the boat?

1273
00:52:03,047 --> 00:52:05,675
Mm, I don't remember, Claire.

1274
00:52:05,783 --> 00:52:07,648
oh, the Claire de Lune.

1275
00:52:10,688 --> 00:52:13,282
That's my parents.

1276
00:52:16,761 --> 00:52:19,821
Claire, they really loved
each other.

1277
00:52:22,433 --> 00:52:24,333
I don't think
theywould've wanted you

1278
00:52:24,435 --> 00:52:25,697
to be afraid oflife.

1279
00:52:25,803 --> 00:52:29,000
I think theywould've wanted
you to be friends with it.

1280
00:52:31,943 --> 00:52:33,274
( voice breaking ):
Yeah.

1281
00:52:33,378 --> 00:52:36,176
( Haileyshouting )

1282
00:52:36,281 --> 00:52:38,613
Whoo! Hailey!

1283
00:52:39,784 --> 00:52:42,378
( sighs )

1284
00:52:46,991 --> 00:52:48,549
It was the most
incredible thing ever.

1285
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:50,651
It was something I wish
I could've done with you.

1286
00:52:50,762 --> 00:52:51,660
STARFISH:
Aqua! Aqua!

1287
00:52:51,763 --> 00:52:53,355
- Thereyou go.
- STARFISH: oh, Aqua!

1288
00:52:53,464 --> 00:52:54,897
SERVER:
And foryou.

1289
00:52:54,999 --> 00:52:56,557
HAI LEY:
Thankyou.

1290
00:52:56,668 --> 00:52:59,728
STARFISH:
Aquamarine is so lovely.

1291
00:52:59,837 --> 00:53:01,395
oh, stop...

1292
00:53:01,506 --> 00:53:04,964
She makes us so lovely
just being near

1293
00:53:05,076 --> 00:53:07,203
such loveliness.

1294
00:53:07,312 --> 00:53:08,677
- ( gentle suctioning )
- And she's smart.

1295
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:12,841
Smart, yes, like tuna!

1296
00:53:12,951 --> 00:53:14,885
HAI LEY:
Like tuna.

1297
00:53:14,986 --> 00:53:17,045
We love
being near Aqua.

1298
00:53:17,155 --> 00:53:18,747
Aqua, Aqua, Aqua!

1299
00:53:18,856 --> 00:53:20,756
( giggling )

1300
00:53:20,858 --> 00:53:22,223
Lookwho it is.

1301
00:53:22,327 --> 00:53:24,522
Wow, the blue hair's
spreading.

1302
00:53:24,629 --> 00:53:27,154
You guys look like
the grandma brigade.

1303
00:53:27,265 --> 00:53:30,860
What's next,
dentures or Depends?

1304
00:53:30,969 --> 00:53:34,166
What's next is I'm going
with Raymond to the Last Splash.

1305
00:53:34,272 --> 00:53:36,103
I've got some advice.

1306
00:53:36,207 --> 00:53:37,401
You need to separate

1307
00:53:37,508 --> 00:53:39,271
fantasy from reality.

1308
00:53:39,377 --> 00:53:41,937
Ray's going to the Last
Splash with Cecilia.

1309
00:53:42,046 --> 00:53:43,741
She asked him last night
at the street fair.

1310
00:53:43,848 --> 00:53:44,837
What?!.

1311
00:53:46,517 --> 00:53:47,779
I'd love to stay and chat,
but we're late

1312
00:53:47,885 --> 00:53:49,443
for Cecilia's pre-party.

1313
00:53:49,554 --> 00:53:52,523
I've got some advice
foryou two.

1314
00:53:55,326 --> 00:53:56,293
( shrieking )

1315
00:53:56,394 --> 00:53:57,554
( laughing )

1316
00:53:58,529 --> 00:54:01,259
( gasping )

1317
00:54:01,366 --> 00:54:02,924
Put on a dry shirt.

1318
00:54:05,069 --> 00:54:07,230
- That was totally amazing!
- That was crazy!

1319
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:11,107
It's Ray.

1320
00:54:11,275 --> 00:54:14,073
I can't believe
I was so stupid!

1321
00:54:14,178 --> 00:54:15,702
Whywould he choose
her over me?

1322
00:54:15,813 --> 00:54:17,440
You're supposed to know him.

1323
00:54:17,548 --> 00:54:19,140
He obviously doesn't
like me at all!

1324
00:54:19,250 --> 00:54:21,377
That's not possible.

1325
00:54:21,486 --> 00:54:22,953
I never should've trusted you
in the first place.

1326
00:54:23,054 --> 00:54:23,782
Aqua, he's intoyou!

1327
00:54:23,888 --> 00:54:24,855
This doesn't
make sense!

1328
00:54:24,956 --> 00:54:25,888
Bull shark!

1329
00:54:26,824 --> 00:54:29,156
Forget it. I'm going home.

1330
00:54:29,260 --> 00:54:31,160
Aqua, no! Wait!

1331
00:54:31,262 --> 00:54:32,126
HAI LEY:
Claire...

1332
00:54:32,230 --> 00:54:34,494
this is totally,
completely...

1333
00:54:34,599 --> 00:54:36,328
eternally over.

1334
00:54:36,434 --> 00:54:38,334
I'm moving.

1335
00:54:38,436 --> 00:54:39,334
( sighs )

1336
00:54:39,437 --> 00:54:41,302
I'm going to be
the new girl again.

1337
00:54:44,776 --> 00:54:47,006
You know what? No.

1338
00:54:47,111 --> 00:54:49,102
No, we're going to split up.

1339
00:54:49,213 --> 00:54:51,181
You're going to go
stop Aqua, and...

1340
00:54:51,282 --> 00:54:53,443
and I'm going to go
find Raymond, okay?

1341
00:54:53,551 --> 00:54:55,917
Meet me back at the club
as soon as possible.

1342
00:54:56,020 --> 00:54:56,884
Hurry!

1343
00:54:56,988 --> 00:54:58,319
Go!

1344
00:55:07,932 --> 00:55:10,127
( waves gurgling )

1345
00:55:18,109 --> 00:55:20,839
HAI LEY:
Aqua, don't do it!

1346
00:55:22,613 --> 00:55:24,376
Don't do it!

1347
00:55:26,117 --> 00:55:27,812
Aqua, you can't do this!

1348
00:55:27,919 --> 00:55:30,479
Why not? I'm never going
to see him again.

1349
00:55:30,588 --> 00:55:33,056
And you know what?
He doesn't care.

1350
00:55:33,157 --> 00:55:34,818
I'm just going
to go home.

1351
00:55:34,926 --> 00:55:35,858
This was all
for nothing.

1352
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:38,121
It was not for nothing;
it was for love.

1353
00:55:38,229 --> 00:55:39,821
You know what I
think oflove?

1354
00:55:39,931 --> 00:55:41,489
Love stinks.

1355
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:43,794
No wonderwe don't
have it back home.

1356
00:55:44,902 --> 00:55:46,802
Please don't give upyet.

1357
00:55:46,904 --> 00:55:48,371
Why, because
ofyourwish?

1358
00:55:49,474 --> 00:55:52,341
Let me tell you something.

1359
00:55:52,443 --> 00:55:54,673
My dad said he loved me.

1360
00:55:54,779 --> 00:55:57,339
He said he loved my mother,
and then he left us.

1361
00:55:57,448 --> 00:56:00,542
He left us
for some otherwoman...

1362
00:56:00,651 --> 00:56:02,551
but I guess
that's just the way it is

1363
00:56:02,653 --> 00:56:04,348
and love doesn't always work.

1364
00:56:05,523 --> 00:56:06,990
I don't understand.

1365
00:56:08,826 --> 00:56:09,884
That's life.

1366
00:56:09,994 --> 00:56:12,224
That's how it is here.

1367
00:56:12,330 --> 00:56:13,661
But when you find love,

1368
00:56:13,764 --> 00:56:14,822
I guess it's
really beautiful,

1369
00:56:14,932 --> 00:56:16,923
or at least that's what
I've read in magazines.

1370
00:56:17,034 --> 00:56:18,501
And I don't know
as much about it as I say I do,

1371
00:56:18,603 --> 00:56:22,835
but I know that there's a reason
why everybodywants it so much.

1372
00:56:22,940 --> 00:56:24,066
And what's that?

1373
00:56:27,145 --> 00:56:29,841
It's the closest thing
we have to magic.

1374
00:56:33,284 --> 00:56:35,411
Don't give upyet.

1375
00:56:39,824 --> 00:56:40,882
oh, my God!

1376
00:56:40,992 --> 00:56:44,052
What's happening to me?

1377
00:56:44,162 --> 00:56:46,289
I'm leaking!

1378
00:56:46,397 --> 00:56:48,957
( laughing ):
Aqua, you're crying.

1379
00:56:49,066 --> 00:56:50,727
I'm leaking saltwater.

1380
00:56:50,835 --> 00:56:52,393
I'm falling apart.

1381
00:56:52,503 --> 00:56:54,061
No, they're tears.

1382
00:56:54,172 --> 00:56:56,072
Your body makes them
when you cry.

1383
00:56:56,174 --> 00:56:59,610
I guess you wouldn't
have them, living underwater.

1384
00:56:59,710 --> 00:57:01,268
This is crazy.

1385
00:57:01,379 --> 00:57:02,607
Nextyou're
going to tell me

1386
00:57:02,713 --> 00:57:05,580
water shoots out ofyour
nose when you're happy.

1387
00:57:05,683 --> 00:57:07,446
( laughing )

1388
00:57:07,552 --> 00:57:09,486
only occasionally.

1389
00:57:12,323 --> 00:57:14,382
( chatting indistinctly )

1390
00:57:14,492 --> 00:57:16,392
( bike bell rings )

1391
00:57:16,494 --> 00:57:17,620
Nice bike.

1392
00:57:17,728 --> 00:57:18,626
( girls snickering )

1393
00:57:18,729 --> 00:57:20,287
Still has tassels.

1394
00:57:22,333 --> 00:57:23,197
Time for a swim!

1395
00:57:23,301 --> 00:57:24,928
( squealing )

1396
00:57:27,371 --> 00:57:30,067
Excuse me.

1397
00:57:38,049 --> 00:57:39,949
How could you do this to Aqua?

1398
00:57:40,051 --> 00:57:41,951
Uh, do what?

1399
00:57:42,053 --> 00:57:43,452
Take Cecilia
to the Last Splash

1400
00:57:43,554 --> 00:57:45,681
afteryou already asked
Aquamarine.

1401
00:57:45,790 --> 00:57:48,281
Yeah, well,
that was before I found out

1402
00:57:48,392 --> 00:57:50,155
that she has a boyfriend.

1403
00:57:50,261 --> 00:57:51,319
A boyfriend?

1404
00:57:51,429 --> 00:57:52,828
Yeah. The one

1405
00:57:52,930 --> 00:57:54,329
she practicallyjumped
overboard for

1406
00:57:54,432 --> 00:57:55,990
to watch the sunset?

1407
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:57,863
Aqua doesn't have a boyfriend.

1408
00:57:57,969 --> 00:57:59,095
Who told you that?

1409
00:58:01,539 --> 00:58:02,699
Vince!

1410
00:58:02,807 --> 00:58:04,274
- Vince!
- Huh?

1411
00:58:04,375 --> 00:58:07,469
- The little girl wants to go in.
- I want to go in where?

1412
00:58:07,578 --> 00:58:09,045
( sing-songy):
Into the pool!

1413
00:58:09,146 --> 00:58:10,113
( screaming ):
No! Put me down!

1414
00:58:10,214 --> 00:58:11,272
No! No! No! No!

1415
00:58:11,382 --> 00:58:13,441
Hey, hey, hey, Vince,
don't, man, don't! Stop!

1416
00:58:13,551 --> 00:58:14,643
- ( screaming )
- Hey, put her down. Come on.

1417
00:58:14,752 --> 00:58:18,813
VI NCE:
okay, okay. Whoo!

1418
00:58:18,923 --> 00:58:20,686
Geez, relax.
What's the big drama?

1419
00:58:21,993 --> 00:58:23,483
VI NCE:
Pfft! Whatever.

1420
00:58:25,963 --> 00:58:28,488
( sniffles )

1421
00:58:28,599 --> 00:58:31,067
( sobbing )

1422
00:58:31,168 --> 00:58:34,296
God, take a joke.

1423
00:58:35,406 --> 00:58:36,839
"Take a joke"?

1424
00:58:36,941 --> 00:58:38,670
Wha-What's the matter with you?
She's scared.

1425
00:58:38,776 --> 00:58:41,244
She was trying
to get attention. Hello!

1426
00:58:41,345 --> 00:58:43,506
No, that's yourjob,
isn't it, Cecilia?

1427
00:58:46,250 --> 00:58:48,844
Raymond, I was kidding.

1428
00:58:48,953 --> 00:58:50,818
Joke? Hello!

1429
00:58:50,921 --> 00:58:52,786
( sniffling )

1430
00:58:53,824 --> 00:58:55,724
Claire, Claire, hold on.

1431
00:58:55,826 --> 00:58:59,728
Hey, you okay?

1432
00:58:59,830 --> 00:59:02,390
Look, um, doyou know
where I can find Aqua?

1433
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:03,899
I really need
to talk to her.

1434
00:59:06,003 --> 00:59:07,732
Yeah? Is that a nod?

1435
00:59:07,838 --> 00:59:09,829
I know I see a nod.

1436
00:59:09,974 --> 00:59:11,407
D.J. ( overradio ):
This next one's

1437
00:59:11,509 --> 00:59:13,841
for the brokenhearted out there.

1438
00:59:13,944 --> 00:59:17,072
( woman singing ballad)

1439
00:59:17,181 --> 00:59:20,947
( Aquamarine moaning )

1440
00:59:24,221 --> 00:59:26,280
Who needs Raymond?

1441
00:59:26,390 --> 00:59:27,448
I found two new men

1442
00:59:27,558 --> 00:59:29,583
to love.

1443
00:59:29,694 --> 00:59:31,457
Their names are Ben and Jerry.

1444
00:59:31,562 --> 00:59:33,029
( Haileylaughing )

1445
00:59:33,130 --> 00:59:34,654
Mm!

1446
00:59:38,936 --> 00:59:39,960
( sighs )

1447
00:59:40,071 --> 00:59:41,129
Raymond.

1448
00:59:41,238 --> 00:59:43,001
Who needs Raymond?

1449
00:59:43,107 --> 00:59:44,631
I need some salt.

1450
00:59:44,742 --> 00:59:45,970
You know, I-I don't know

1451
00:59:46,077 --> 00:59:47,442
what Cecilia was
talking about.

1452
00:59:47,545 --> 00:59:49,672
( sighs )

1453
00:59:49,780 --> 00:59:52,044
I, uh, think they're
in here in my room.

1454
00:59:52,950 --> 00:59:53,382
( gasps )

1455
00:59:55,152 --> 00:59:55,846
- ( splashing )
- Aqua's right around here...

1456
00:59:55,953 --> 00:59:57,716
oh, God!

1457
00:59:57,822 --> 00:59:59,619
Hey!

1458
00:59:59,724 --> 01:00:00,554
( clears throat )

1459
01:00:00,658 --> 01:00:01,989
Uh, um, sorry. I'm sorry.

1460
01:00:02,093 --> 01:00:04,618
How's it going?

1461
01:00:04,729 --> 01:00:06,526
Bad. No, good. Fine.

1462
01:00:06,630 --> 01:00:07,528
( clears throat )

1463
01:00:07,631 --> 01:00:08,529
Why don't you wait
on the balcony,

1464
01:00:08,632 --> 01:00:09,724
- Yeah.
- and we'll be out in a sec.

1465
01:00:12,136 --> 01:00:14,036
( mouthing )

1466
01:00:16,807 --> 01:00:17,796
( laughing )

1467
01:00:17,908 --> 01:00:20,138
What was he
doing here?!.

1468
01:00:20,244 --> 01:00:22,178
Cecilia told him
Aqua had a boyfriend.

1469
01:00:22,279 --> 01:00:23,268
( gasps, then scoffs )

1470
01:00:23,381 --> 01:00:25,713
That... that barnacle!

1471
01:00:25,816 --> 01:00:27,545
But Raymond wants
to talk to you.

1472
01:00:27,651 --> 01:00:30,017
- oh, my God! oh, my God!
- Yes! Yes!

1473
01:00:30,121 --> 01:00:31,850
AQUAMARI NE:
oh, my God!

1474
01:00:31,956 --> 01:00:35,983
( giggling )

1475
01:00:36,093 --> 01:00:38,584
- Hey.
- Hey.

1476
01:00:38,696 --> 01:00:42,462
( indistinct conversation )

1477
01:00:47,304 --> 01:00:49,704
- Hey, you know what?
- And then the fish attacked me.

1478
01:00:49,807 --> 01:00:51,468
- It attacked you? Really?
- Yeah.

1479
01:00:51,575 --> 01:00:53,372
- Kind of like a penguin, like...
- RAY: Later, guys.

1480
01:00:53,477 --> 01:00:56,071
- oh, hey.
- Thanks for coming.

1481
01:01:00,818 --> 01:01:01,944
( sighs )

1482
01:01:02,052 --> 01:01:04,077
- ( sighs )
- ( laughs )

1483
01:01:07,691 --> 01:01:09,488
( shudders )

1484
01:01:09,593 --> 01:01:11,891
Guess who's got a date
to The Last Splash.

1485
01:01:11,996 --> 01:01:14,931
- ( gasping )
- ( squealing ): Me!

1486
01:01:15,032 --> 01:01:16,932
( laughter, shouting )

1487
01:01:17,101 --> 01:01:18,466
( laughing )

1488
01:01:18,569 --> 01:01:22,232
( whooping )

1489
01:01:22,339 --> 01:01:24,899
( chuckles )

1490
01:01:25,009 --> 01:01:28,877
( upbeat music playing )

1491
01:01:38,389 --> 01:01:39,583
Gently catch it.

1492
01:01:39,690 --> 01:01:41,658
I fyou break your balloon,
you're out.

1493
01:01:41,759 --> 01:01:43,522
okay, now toss it back.

1494
01:01:43,627 --> 01:01:47,119
Remember to keep
stepping back as you go.

1495
01:01:47,231 --> 01:01:50,496
Come on, people!
You can win a date with me!

1496
01:01:50,601 --> 01:01:52,569
oh, good throw, man.

1497
01:01:52,670 --> 01:01:54,262
You ready for the heater?

1498
01:01:55,706 --> 01:01:57,264
- Whoa! okay.
- ( laughing )

1499
01:01:57,374 --> 01:01:58,671
Careful. Heavy-handed.

1500
01:01:58,776 --> 01:02:00,505
You go under,
not over.

1501
01:02:00,611 --> 01:02:02,010
You don't want
to drop it.

1502
01:02:02,112 --> 01:02:04,239
okay, take
a step back.

1503
01:02:04,348 --> 01:02:08,751
( conversations fade,
music continues )

1504
01:02:13,390 --> 01:02:14,687
( crowd gasping )

1505
01:02:14,792 --> 01:02:17,352
( laughing )

1506
01:02:17,461 --> 01:02:18,860
Ray, you're out.

1507
01:02:18,963 --> 01:02:20,362
Come on,
offyou go.

1508
01:02:20,464 --> 01:02:23,297
( laughing )

1509
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:25,197
oh, I think I feel seasick.

1510
01:02:25,302 --> 01:02:27,497
You know?

1511
01:02:30,875 --> 01:02:33,275
But in a good way.

1512
01:02:33,377 --> 01:02:34,401
J ust be yourself.

1513
01:02:34,512 --> 01:02:35,501
Minus the tail.

1514
01:02:56,500 --> 01:02:58,491
Hi...

1515
01:02:58,602 --> 01:03:00,900
Hi.

1516
01:03:01,005 --> 01:03:03,838
Wow, you look pretty.

1517
01:03:03,941 --> 01:03:06,136
So do you.

1518
01:03:06,243 --> 01:03:09,076
( chuckles ):
Thankyou.

1519
01:03:09,179 --> 01:03:11,238
So what do you say
we grab something to eat?

1520
01:03:11,348 --> 01:03:13,475
Yes. I'm good at that.

1521
01:03:13,584 --> 01:03:16,382
( chuckles ):
okay.

1522
01:03:16,487 --> 01:03:18,512
( gasps ):
Here they come.

1523
01:03:19,990 --> 01:03:21,287
- Hey.
- Hi, guys.

1524
01:03:21,392 --> 01:03:24,190
Hey.

1525
01:03:24,295 --> 01:03:26,160
( giggling excitedly )

1526
01:03:26,263 --> 01:03:30,597
( crowd whooping, laughing )

1527
01:03:30,701 --> 01:03:33,226
What can I get you?

1528
01:03:39,076 --> 01:03:41,010
( giggling )

1529
01:03:42,212 --> 01:03:43,543
They're there.

1530
01:03:45,649 --> 01:03:46,377
- Hey.
- Hi.

1531
01:03:47,818 --> 01:03:48,842
Hmm.

1532
01:03:54,191 --> 01:03:56,352
Um... is that good?

1533
01:03:56,460 --> 01:03:59,122
Yes. It's very calming.

1534
01:03:59,229 --> 01:04:01,789
okay, I'll try some.

1535
01:04:07,538 --> 01:04:08,436
No, no...

1536
01:04:08,539 --> 01:04:11,474
Eh, that's good.

1537
01:04:11,575 --> 01:04:13,736
( exhales deeply)

1538
01:04:13,844 --> 01:04:15,175
( sniffs )

1539
01:04:15,279 --> 01:04:16,371
To...

1540
01:04:17,715 --> 01:04:19,148
...new things.

1541
01:04:21,852 --> 01:04:23,080
( gasping )

1542
01:04:32,262 --> 01:04:33,422
( coughs )

1543
01:04:33,530 --> 01:04:35,327
Sorry.

1544
01:04:36,367 --> 01:04:39,336
( coughing )

1545
01:04:39,436 --> 01:04:40,767
Guess it's
an acquired taste, huh?

1546
01:04:40,871 --> 01:04:42,634
( coughs )

1547
01:04:42,740 --> 01:04:44,605
HAI LEY: Looks like they're
having a genius time.

1548
01:04:44,708 --> 01:04:45,970
Hey.

1549
01:04:46,076 --> 01:04:47,703
You look really
pretty, honey.

1550
01:04:47,811 --> 01:04:48,800
Thanks.

1551
01:04:48,912 --> 01:04:49,674
Hey.

1552
01:04:49,780 --> 01:04:50,872
Hi.

1553
01:04:50,981 --> 01:04:52,676
I see you and Claire

1554
01:04:52,783 --> 01:04:54,148
have made
a new friend.

1555
01:04:54,251 --> 01:04:55,377
Yeah, how 'bout that?

1556
01:04:55,486 --> 01:04:57,078
Another person
I get to say good-bye to.

1557
01:04:57,187 --> 01:05:01,180
Ginny! oh, Ginny.

1558
01:05:01,291 --> 01:05:03,282
I just read about you
in the Tribune.

1559
01:05:03,394 --> 01:05:06,591
You didn't tell me
you were one of, what?

1560
01:05:06,697 --> 01:05:08,824
200 applicants?
What an honor.

1561
01:05:08,932 --> 01:05:10,058
I've been trying to land

1562
01:05:10,167 --> 01:05:11,464
a grant like this
for ten years.

1563
01:05:11,568 --> 01:05:13,593
I just hope we can
do some good with it.

1564
01:05:13,704 --> 01:05:15,535
only the fish will
know for sure.

1565
01:05:15,639 --> 01:05:17,539
Aren'tyou happy
foryour mom?

1566
01:05:17,641 --> 01:05:21,338
Ecstatic.

1567
01:05:21,445 --> 01:05:25,211
oh, come on.

1568
01:05:25,315 --> 01:05:26,009
Don't worry,
honey.

1569
01:05:26,116 --> 01:05:27,811
You know how
kids are.

1570
01:05:31,121 --> 01:05:33,351
So, ifyou could travel
anywhere in the world,

1571
01:05:33,457 --> 01:05:34,287
where would you go?

1572
01:05:34,391 --> 01:05:35,358
oh, that's easy.

1573
01:05:35,459 --> 01:05:37,620
I would go to Fiji.
I hear it's amazing.

1574
01:05:37,728 --> 01:05:39,320
It is.
It's unbelievable.

1575
01:05:39,430 --> 01:05:40,795
You've been there?

1576
01:05:40,898 --> 01:05:44,129
Well, I've been
to lots of places.

1577
01:05:44,234 --> 01:05:49,069
But I've learned it's not where
you are, it's whoyou're with.

1578
01:05:49,173 --> 01:05:50,401
Hmm.

1579
01:05:50,507 --> 01:05:52,168
You always
so sure of everything?

1580
01:05:52,276 --> 01:05:53,834
Yes.

1581
01:05:53,944 --> 01:05:56,538
More people should be like that.

1582
01:05:56,647 --> 01:06:00,481
Well, some of us are only human.

1583
01:06:00,584 --> 01:06:02,745
( chuckles )

1584
01:06:02,853 --> 01:06:03,911
( feedback buzzes )

1585
01:06:04,021 --> 01:06:06,182
( crowdcheering )

1586
01:06:06,290 --> 01:06:08,315
Thankyou.

1587
01:06:12,629 --> 01:06:14,256
Hey. How you doing?

1588
01:06:14,364 --> 01:06:15,422
Wow, thanks.

1589
01:06:15,532 --> 01:06:16,897
( indistinct whispering )

1590
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,867
- Please.
- Ah...

1591
01:06:19,970 --> 01:06:21,028
Yeah, sure, we can do that.

1592
01:06:21,138 --> 01:06:22,537
I love that song.

1593
01:06:24,141 --> 01:06:25,768
Hi, everyone.

1594
01:06:25,876 --> 01:06:28,367
We'd like to start things off
with a special request.

1595
01:06:28,479 --> 01:06:31,277
( guitarintro )

1596
01:06:31,381 --> 01:06:33,178
( singing )

1597
01:06:33,283 --> 01:06:36,446
oh, I love this song.
You want to dance?

1598
01:06:36,553 --> 01:06:39,920
I want to, but...
I don't know how.

1599
01:06:40,023 --> 01:06:41,581
What? No, it's easy.
I'll show you. Come on.

1600
01:06:41,692 --> 01:06:43,125
Come on.
You can't be worse than me.

1601
01:06:45,829 --> 01:06:49,526
( singing continues )

1602
01:07:09,353 --> 01:07:10,980
I told you I was bad.

1603
01:07:11,088 --> 01:07:13,488
No, you're great, you're great.
It's okay.

1604
01:07:13,590 --> 01:07:16,081
Um... here.

1605
01:07:16,193 --> 01:07:17,922
You ever spend
any time in the water?

1606
01:07:18,028 --> 01:07:19,689
Some. You know.

1607
01:07:19,797 --> 01:07:21,321
Right. okay.

1608
01:07:21,431 --> 01:07:24,764
So, you just kind of
let the music carryyou.

1609
01:07:24,868 --> 01:07:26,768
You know,
just like a wave would.

1610
01:07:28,272 --> 01:07:30,433
Wavy, yeah.

1611
01:07:31,942 --> 01:07:33,307
There you go.

1612
01:07:33,410 --> 01:07:37,107
Yeah, thereyou go. Nice.

1613
01:08:11,615 --> 01:08:13,549
I'll be right back.

1614
01:08:17,287 --> 01:08:19,619
Back off- don't make
a bigger fool ofyourself

1615
01:08:19,723 --> 01:08:20,815
than you already have.

1616
01:08:31,635 --> 01:08:33,068
Walk away.

1617
01:08:35,806 --> 01:08:37,330
- Bye.
- Walk away.

1618
01:08:39,776 --> 01:08:41,403
Good job.

1619
01:08:49,286 --> 01:08:51,220
BoTH:
He's so into her.

1620
01:08:51,321 --> 01:08:53,152
He likes her.

1621
01:09:15,479 --> 01:09:19,540
- ( songstops )
- ( cheering )

1622
01:09:22,786 --> 01:09:24,913
Thankyou,
Capri Beach Club.

1623
01:09:34,898 --> 01:09:38,095
Sunset. Come on.

1624
01:09:38,201 --> 01:09:42,262
( laughter)

1625
01:09:42,372 --> 01:09:44,101
I think I like
dancing with you

1626
01:09:44,207 --> 01:09:46,937
better than anything
I've ever done on feet.

1627
01:09:47,044 --> 01:09:48,375
HAI LEY:
Hey!

1628
01:09:48,478 --> 01:09:50,571
Say good-bye.
It's time to go.

1629
01:09:53,050 --> 01:09:55,541
Uh-oh. I have to go.

1630
01:09:55,652 --> 01:09:56,949
Wh-What? Again?

1631
01:09:57,054 --> 01:10:00,285
Come on, at least
stay for the fireworks.

1632
01:10:00,390 --> 01:10:03,917
- Come on.
- There's gonna be fireworks?

1633
01:10:06,029 --> 01:10:07,223
I can't.

1634
01:10:07,331 --> 01:10:08,992
I wish I could, I really do.

1635
01:10:09,099 --> 01:10:10,464
Butyou leave
tomorrow.

1636
01:10:10,567 --> 01:10:12,899
I want to spend
more time with you.

1637
01:10:13,003 --> 01:10:15,335
What can I say to makeyou stay?

1638
01:10:17,107 --> 01:10:20,099
You can tell me...

1639
01:10:20,210 --> 01:10:22,144
- What? Tell you what?
- Aqua, we have to go right now.

1640
01:10:22,245 --> 01:10:24,338
Come on.

1641
01:10:24,448 --> 01:10:26,211
Tomorrow.
Tomorrowyou can tell me.

1642
01:10:26,316 --> 01:10:27,578
Come to the pier at 9:00.

1643
01:10:27,684 --> 01:10:28,616
To tell you what?

1644
01:10:38,595 --> 01:10:40,119
You can tell me
how that makes you feel.

1645
01:10:40,230 --> 01:10:41,788
- Come on!
- Come on!

1646
01:10:41,898 --> 01:10:43,263
( giggling, laughing )

1647
01:10:45,769 --> 01:10:46,997
Wow.

1648
01:10:47,104 --> 01:10:50,335
( chuckles )

1649
01:10:53,810 --> 01:10:56,210
( indistinct conversation )

1650
01:10:56,313 --> 01:10:58,975
( laughing )

1651
01:10:59,082 --> 01:11:00,481
Come on, Hails.

1652
01:11:00,584 --> 01:11:02,677
( engine starts )

1653
01:11:13,063 --> 01:11:18,057
( light, upbeat theme playing )

1654
01:11:18,168 --> 01:11:20,898
( laughing )

1655
01:11:21,004 --> 01:11:23,837
Whoo!

1656
01:11:26,676 --> 01:11:28,576
okay,
you I ittle freaks.

1657
01:11:28,678 --> 01:11:30,771
What are you doing here?

1658
01:11:30,881 --> 01:11:32,872
Cecilia, I want to go
back to the party.

1659
01:11:32,983 --> 01:11:35,076
They're handing out
sparklers.

1660
01:11:35,218 --> 01:11:38,381
( crowd cheering )

1661
01:11:42,192 --> 01:11:45,525
( man singing )

1662
01:12:15,992 --> 01:12:18,961

( giggling )

1664

She lives
in a water tower.

1665
01:12:42,385 --> 01:12:44,580
Freak city.

1666
01:12:44,688 --> 01:12:47,350
This is so lame.

1667
01:12:47,457 --> 01:12:49,220
And who cares?

1668
01:12:49,326 --> 01:12:52,420
I'm tired of sitting
here staring at it.

1669
01:12:52,529 --> 01:12:56,295
Yeah, Cecilia, we already
missed the fireworks,

1670
01:12:56,399 --> 01:12:59,300
and now we're missing the party.

1671
01:12:59,402 --> 01:13:01,870
Um, Patty, could you
put away the negativity,

1672
01:13:01,972 --> 01:13:03,337
sort oflikeyou put away

1673
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:05,635
all those corn dogs
at the street fair?

1674
01:13:07,410 --> 01:13:09,469
I'm going up.
If anyone comes...

1675
01:13:10,413 --> 01:13:12,643
honk.

1676
01:13:12,749 --> 01:13:13,977
But...

1677
01:13:14,084 --> 01:13:16,746
But I only...
I only had two.

1678
01:13:18,622 --> 01:13:21,523
( panting )

1679
01:13:21,625 --> 01:13:24,059
( wrychuckle )

1680
01:13:25,962 --> 01:13:27,896
Who needs this?

1681
01:13:32,469 --> 01:13:34,801
Uh...

1682
01:13:34,905 --> 01:13:38,671
( laughing )

1683
01:13:38,775 --> 01:13:40,174
Here we go.

1684
01:13:40,277 --> 01:13:42,268
( engine starts )

1685
01:13:42,379 --> 01:13:44,279

- Shh!

1686
01:13:44,381 --> 01:13:49,284
( laughing )

1687
01:13:49,386 --> 01:13:52,116
What are you up to, huh?

1688
01:13:52,222 --> 01:13:55,282
( humming )

1689
01:13:55,392 --> 01:13:56,791
( giggling )

1690
01:13:56,893 --> 01:13:59,555
( humming )

1691
01:13:59,663 --> 01:14:01,893
( singing )

1692
01:14:14,678 --> 01:14:17,112
Hailey?

1693
01:14:19,015 --> 01:14:21,040
Is someone there?

1694
01:14:23,253 --> 01:14:25,619
( gasps )

1695
01:14:26,856 --> 01:14:29,188
( gasps )

1696
01:14:32,896 --> 01:14:34,295
Uh...

1697
01:14:34,397 --> 01:14:36,957
( gasping )

1698
01:14:38,235 --> 01:14:39,668
( locks )

1699
01:14:39,769 --> 01:14:42,169
oh, my God. oh, my God.

1700
01:14:42,272 --> 01:14:45,639
Wait! Cecilia.

1701
01:14:45,742 --> 01:14:48,233
( panting ):
okay, okay...

1702
01:14:51,248 --> 01:14:53,648
( loud clang )

1703
01:14:53,750 --> 01:14:55,980
( screams )

1704
01:15:00,490 --> 01:15:02,151
( shuddering )

1705
01:15:02,259 --> 01:15:04,853
oh...

1706
01:15:08,398 --> 01:15:11,697
Nice... and... slow.

1707
01:15:11,801 --> 01:15:13,996
( panting )

1708
01:15:14,104 --> 01:15:15,230
She's a... She's a...

1709
01:15:17,707 --> 01:15:20,175
She's a, she's a,
she's a... a... a...

1710
01:15:22,245 --> 01:15:23,803
Wh...

1711
01:15:35,692 --> 01:15:38,422
You want something done,

1712
01:15:38,528 --> 01:15:40,155
you have to do it your...

1713
01:15:40,263 --> 01:15:41,992
( grunting )

1714
01:15:42,098 --> 01:15:43,224
...self!.

1715
01:15:43,333 --> 01:15:45,597
( panting )

1716
01:15:45,702 --> 01:15:46,669
( grunting )

1717
01:15:46,770 --> 01:15:47,794
( screeching )

1718
01:15:50,707 --> 01:15:56,668
( grunting )

1719
01:15:56,780 --> 01:15:58,338
( music playing )

1720
01:15:58,448 --> 01:16:01,144
oh, I need
to see your hand stamp.

1721
01:16:01,251 --> 01:16:02,650
Thankyou.

1722
01:16:02,752 --> 01:16:04,242
G'night!

1723
01:16:04,354 --> 01:16:06,788
Uh, can I see
your hand stamp, please?

1724
01:16:06,890 --> 01:16:07,982
This is my hand stamp.

1725
01:16:08,091 --> 01:16:09,786
- Mm...
- ( giggling )

1726
01:16:09,893 --> 01:16:11,292
- You know who I am.
- Sorry, Cecilia.

1727
01:16:11,394 --> 01:16:12,884
Has grilling burgers
fried your brain,

1728
01:16:12,996 --> 01:16:15,328
or doyou grill burgers all day
becauseyou have no brain?

1729
01:16:15,432 --> 01:16:16,660
Excuse me.

1730
01:16:16,766 --> 01:16:18,757
- Girls!
- Cecilia.

1731
01:16:18,868 --> 01:16:21,132
Aquamarine...

1732
01:16:21,237 --> 01:16:22,261
She's a mermaid.

1733
01:16:22,372 --> 01:16:24,033
She has, she has scales
and everything.

1734
01:16:24,140 --> 01:16:25,869
She has a big, fat tail.

1735
01:16:25,975 --> 01:16:27,306
That's why she lives
in thewatertower.

1736
01:16:27,410 --> 01:16:28,968
Whoa. You need
to slow way down.

1737
01:16:29,079 --> 01:16:30,341
What areyou
talking about?

1738
01:16:30,447 --> 01:16:32,381
You're sounding
a little crazy, Cecilia.

1739
01:16:32,482 --> 01:16:34,450
No, no, no, no.
No, I'm not crazy.

1740
01:16:34,551 --> 01:16:36,348
No, I saw it with my own eyes.

1741
01:16:36,453 --> 01:16:38,216
- You're freaking us out.
- There's no mermaid.

1742
01:16:38,321 --> 01:16:39,652
Why areyou looking
at me like that

1743
01:16:39,756 --> 01:16:40,654
when there's a mermaid

1744
01:16:40,757 --> 01:16:42,190
in a water tower, you guys?

1745
01:16:42,292 --> 01:16:43,122
There's no mermaid.

1746
01:16:43,226 --> 01:16:45,091
oh, okay. Fine.

1747
01:16:45,195 --> 01:16:47,527
And by the way, why'd you
guys leave me there, huh?

1748
01:16:47,630 --> 01:16:50,360
Do you have any idea
how far I had to walk?!.

1749
01:16:50,467 --> 01:16:52,264
- ( giggling )
- Huh?

1750
01:16:52,369 --> 01:16:53,961
- She's crazy.
- Why is that funny?

1751
01:16:54,070 --> 01:16:55,298
( giggling )

1752
01:16:58,742 --> 01:17:01,006
GI RL ( laughing ):
A mermaid.

1753
01:17:10,620 --> 01:17:12,850
( chainjingling )

1754
01:17:12,956 --> 01:17:15,186
Hmm.

1755
01:17:24,934 --> 01:17:27,528
Huh...

1756
01:17:41,718 --> 01:17:44,414
( sighs )

1757
01:17:52,128 --> 01:17:54,892
( quiet, gentle theme plays )

1758
01:17:57,133 --> 01:17:58,566
GI N NY: 40 boxes,
was that it?

1759
01:17:58,668 --> 01:17:59,896
- MAN: No, it's 55.
- GI N NY: Fifty-five.

1760
01:18:00,003 --> 01:18:01,994
MAN: And the window's going
to have to be dismantled...

1761
01:18:02,105 --> 01:18:03,436
Bye, Mom.

1762
01:18:03,540 --> 01:18:07,135
Hey, be back soon,
Hails.

1763
01:18:07,243 --> 01:18:10,610
Daddy! Daddy!
Daddy, it's so horrible.

1764
01:18:10,713 --> 01:18:12,112
I went on my run
this morning,

1765
01:18:12,215 --> 01:18:13,239
down by the water tower,

1766
01:18:13,349 --> 01:18:14,646
and, and I heard this

1767
01:18:14,751 --> 01:18:16,946
crying and...
this poor girl,

1768
01:18:17,053 --> 01:18:19,317
I think she's
trapped up there.

1769
01:18:19,422 --> 01:18:20,616
Did you call the police?

1770
01:18:22,258 --> 01:18:24,123
Uh, I wanted
to tell you first.

1771
01:18:28,665 --> 01:18:31,657
( phone keypadbeeping )

1772
01:18:31,768 --> 01:18:31,901
- ( knocking )
- Come in.

1773
01:18:31,901 --> 01:18:33,960
- ( knocking )
- Come in.

1774
01:18:34,070 --> 01:18:35,901
Hey.

1775
01:18:36,005 --> 01:18:37,267
Hey.

1776
01:18:40,376 --> 01:18:43,402
Will you take care
of Moby for me?

1777
01:18:43,513 --> 01:18:45,981
You won't have to go tomorrow.

1778
01:18:46,082 --> 01:18:48,915
Believe me.

1779
01:18:49,018 --> 01:18:51,612
So, I was thinking,
we should meet at the pier

1780
01:18:51,721 --> 01:18:53,586
at around 8:455.

1781
01:18:55,058 --> 01:18:56,855
Hail.

1782
01:18:56,960 --> 01:18:59,861
- Areyou listening to me?
- Mm-hmm.

1783
01:19:03,700 --> 01:19:05,691
Maybe we should think
about thewish.

1784
01:19:08,972 --> 01:19:10,030
What doyou mean?

1785
01:19:10,139 --> 01:19:11,504
We know what
we're doing

1786
01:19:11,608 --> 01:19:12,632
with ourwish.

1787
01:19:12,742 --> 01:19:15,040
You're staying in Baybridge.

1788
01:19:15,144 --> 01:19:18,671
Right, but I was thinking
about it all last night,

1789
01:19:18,781 --> 01:19:21,147
and...

1790
01:19:21,251 --> 01:19:24,687
um, my mom has worked
all her life forthis.

1791
01:19:24,787 --> 01:19:26,186
Maybe it's not fair.

1792
01:19:26,289 --> 01:19:29,087
We asked for a miracle, Hailey,
and we got it.

1793
01:19:29,192 --> 01:19:31,183
We're using it.

1794
01:19:34,264 --> 01:19:37,165
Maybe we could wish
for something else, maybe.

1795
01:19:37,267 --> 01:19:38,291
Something else?

1796
01:19:38,401 --> 01:19:39,299
Mm-hmm.

1797
01:19:39,402 --> 01:19:41,165
Like what?
Like a new best friend?

1798
01:19:42,405 --> 01:19:45,033
A new person
to tell everything to?

1799
01:19:45,141 --> 01:19:46,472
Claire, no, stop it.

1800
01:19:46,576 --> 01:19:48,669
How can you even think that way?

1801
01:19:48,778 --> 01:19:50,177
I'm just saying,
maybe we'll learn

1802
01:19:50,280 --> 01:19:52,009
to stand on our own
for a change, you know?

1803
01:19:52,115 --> 01:19:54,845
- You mean me, don'tyou?
- I mean I'm notyour mom.

1804
01:19:56,486 --> 01:19:57,714
Please.

1805
01:19:57,820 --> 01:20:00,880
You act like I need you
all the time when...

1806
01:20:00,990 --> 01:20:03,823
the truth is,
you're so mad at the world

1807
01:20:03,927 --> 01:20:06,452
that nobody but me even
wants to talk toyou.

1808
01:20:06,563 --> 01:20:07,996
oh?

1809
01:20:08,097 --> 01:20:10,395
Soyou're the one who's
lived hereyourwhole life?

1810
01:20:10,500 --> 01:20:11,694
How doyou figure

1811
01:20:11,801 --> 01:20:12,825
that I'm your only friend?

1812
01:20:14,938 --> 01:20:15,836
Huh?

1813
01:20:15,939 --> 01:20:21,775
( sniffling )

1814
01:20:21,878 --> 01:20:24,210
...WQDA, the coast's
breaking news channel.

1815
01:20:24,314 --> 01:20:28,250
A report just in
ofa young girl trapped

1816
01:20:28,418 --> 01:20:30,613
- in the Baybridge water tower.
- ( shrieks )

1817
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:33,712
We're going live to Storm Banks,
our man on the scene.

1818
01:20:33,823 --> 01:20:37,919
This is Storm Banks reporting
live from Baybridge water tower,

1819
01:20:38,027 --> 01:20:40,689
where an unidentified girl
has been trapped.

1820
01:20:40,797 --> 01:20:43,630
Firefighters
are racing against time

1821
01:20:43,733 --> 01:20:45,724
- to rescue this girl...
- Hailey, wait!

1822
01:20:45,835 --> 01:20:47,200
...from a watery grave.

1823
01:20:47,303 --> 01:20:49,498
Hailey, wait!
Hailey!

1824
01:20:58,348 --> 01:21:00,111
( sighs )

1825
01:21:00,216 --> 01:21:01,240
So how did you
come across this?

1826
01:21:01,351 --> 01:21:02,283
CECI LIA:
I was just out

1827
01:21:02,385 --> 01:21:03,443
for my morning run,
and all of a sudden

1828
01:21:03,553 --> 01:21:05,020
I heard this horrible screaming.

1829
01:21:05,121 --> 01:21:07,248
I didn't know what to do,
and, I mean,

1830
01:21:07,357 --> 01:21:09,757
I did the first thing
that came to my mind,

1831
01:21:09,859 --> 01:21:11,850
which was go
to inform the newscast,

1832
01:21:11,961 --> 01:21:13,929
and, um, you know,
we can only hope

1833
01:21:14,030 --> 01:21:15,930
- that we find her.
- The ladder's gone.

1834
01:21:17,066 --> 01:21:18,397
- oh, no.
- I just did

1835
01:21:18,501 --> 01:21:20,469
what any good citizen
would have done.

1836
01:21:20,570 --> 01:21:23,539
And we can only hope that
they'll pull her out in time,

1837
01:21:23,640 --> 01:21:27,542
so she can be reunited
with her friends and loved ones.

1838
01:21:27,644 --> 01:21:29,271
Hey,
he's got something!

1839
01:21:29,379 --> 01:21:30,937
- ( gasps )
- okay, guys. Showtime.

1840
01:21:31,047 --> 01:21:32,810
( indistinct radio
transmission )

1841
01:21:35,385 --> 01:21:37,979
SToRM:
okay, are you getting this?

1842
01:21:41,157 --> 01:21:43,489
- ( squeaking )
- We got a floater.

1843
01:21:43,593 --> 01:21:44,924
( crowd laughing )

1844
01:21:45,028 --> 01:21:47,019
No, no, that's not possible.

1845
01:21:47,130 --> 01:21:48,392
No, she's up there.

1846
01:21:48,498 --> 01:21:49,396
Yeah, okay,
sweetie.

1847
01:21:49,499 --> 01:21:51,126
No, she's up there.

1848
01:21:52,268 --> 01:21:54,395
They know
what's going on.

1849
01:21:54,504 --> 01:21:56,438
They know exactly
what's going on.

1850
01:21:56,539 --> 01:21:58,598
Tell them. Tell them
how she's up there.

1851
01:21:58,708 --> 01:22:00,938
She's probably still
hiding under the water.

1852
01:22:01,044 --> 01:22:01,942
Go to commercial.

1853
01:22:02,045 --> 01:22:02,807
Daddy!

1854
01:22:02,912 --> 01:22:04,038
You know why?

1855
01:22:04,147 --> 01:22:06,479
Because she is a mermaid.

1856
01:22:06,582 --> 01:22:07,640
- ( laughing )
- Go to commercial.

1857
01:22:07,750 --> 01:22:08,808
Mermaid!

1858
01:22:08,918 --> 01:22:11,478
Mer-maid.

1859
01:22:11,587 --> 01:22:13,020
- ( laughing )
- Go to commercial now.

1860
01:22:13,122 --> 01:22:13,952
Fins and everything.

1861
01:22:15,458 --> 01:22:16,789
You've got to be
kidding me.

1862
01:22:16,893 --> 01:22:18,417
Give meyour keys.

1863
01:22:18,528 --> 01:22:19,927
No, Dad.

1864
01:22:20,029 --> 01:22:21,121
- Cecilia...
- No.

1865
01:22:21,230 --> 01:22:22,561
No, no, no, no, no.

1866
01:22:22,665 --> 01:22:23,859
Cecilia!

1867
01:22:23,966 --> 01:22:24,990
- ooh.
- Give me

1868
01:22:25,101 --> 01:22:28,036
your car keys... now!

1869
01:22:30,406 --> 01:22:32,271
( stifledsnickering )

1870
01:22:34,410 --> 01:22:35,434
( whimpering )

1871
01:22:35,545 --> 01:22:37,638
And while you're walking
to school every day,

1872
01:22:37,747 --> 01:22:39,408
you can try and
figure out why it is

1873
01:22:39,515 --> 01:22:40,709
you need so much attention.

1874
01:22:40,817 --> 01:22:42,307
( gasps )

1875
01:22:42,418 --> 01:22:44,352
Where could she be?

1876
01:22:44,454 --> 01:22:47,014
I don't know. Let's go.

1877
01:22:47,123 --> 01:22:48,215
It's a wrap.

1878
01:22:48,324 --> 01:22:49,848
on my career.

1879
01:22:49,959 --> 01:22:51,358
( laughing )

1880
01:22:51,461 --> 01:22:53,326
But, Daddy, my car!

1881
01:22:53,429 --> 01:22:55,897
Save it, Cecilia.

1882
01:22:56,065 --> 01:22:59,159
You know why?
Because she is a mermaid.

1883
01:22:59,268 --> 01:23:01,566
Go to commercial.

1884
01:23:01,671 --> 01:23:06,199
( Aquamarine and Leonard
laughing )

1885
01:23:06,309 --> 01:23:10,439
There's not usually a man with
a ladder around when you need him.

1886
01:23:10,546 --> 01:23:11,979
I can't thankyou enough.

1887
01:23:12,081 --> 01:23:13,912
I guess I could say
the same to you.

1888
01:23:14,016 --> 01:23:15,984
You're probably
the first person

1889
01:23:16,085 --> 01:23:17,484
who's talked to me all summer.

1890
01:23:17,587 --> 01:23:20,147
At least nicely.

1891
01:23:20,256 --> 01:23:22,486
I appreciate that.

1892
01:23:34,203 --> 01:23:37,400
You're a long way from home,
aren'tyou?

1893
01:23:42,445 --> 01:23:44,379
oh, thankyou!

1894
01:23:45,848 --> 01:23:47,543
( woman humming )

1895
01:23:53,723 --> 01:23:56,021
You know,

1896
01:23:56,125 --> 01:23:57,683
when you help
a mermaid,

1897
01:23:57,794 --> 01:24:00,092
you get a wish.

1898
01:24:04,934 --> 01:24:08,802
( cawing )

1899
01:24:10,673 --> 01:24:11,662
CLAI RE:
It's almost 9:30

1900
01:24:11,774 --> 01:24:13,674
and she's not here-
where else could she be?

1901
01:24:13,776 --> 01:24:15,073
Don't say it like
it's my fault.

1902
01:24:15,178 --> 01:24:17,908
- Shh! There's Ray.
- Yeah, I can see that. Thanks.

1903
01:24:18,014 --> 01:24:19,140
What is your problem?

1904
01:24:19,248 --> 01:24:21,375
I'm not giving up
this wish, Hailey.

1905
01:24:32,395 --> 01:24:34,955
She's here.

1906
01:24:37,500 --> 01:24:39,934
- ( whimpers )
- Hey!

1907
01:24:40,036 --> 01:24:41,936
- Hi.
- Hi.

1908
01:24:42,038 --> 01:24:43,403
I, um...

1909
01:24:43,506 --> 01:24:46,168
I thought aboutyou all night.

1910
01:24:46,275 --> 01:24:48,243
Good.

1911
01:24:48,344 --> 01:24:50,312
( laughing ):
Yeah.

1912
01:24:50,413 --> 01:24:55,783
So... what was it thatyou, um,
wanted to tell me?

1913
01:24:55,885 --> 01:24:57,819
or ask me?
I wasn't sure.

1914
01:24:57,920 --> 01:25:00,354
okay, here it goes.

1915
01:25:00,456 --> 01:25:02,822
The last couple of
days have been...

1916
01:25:02,925 --> 01:25:05,587
- amazing...
- Yeah, but wait...

1917
01:25:05,695 --> 01:25:07,128
Before we get
to that, uh,

1918
01:25:07,230 --> 01:25:10,495
could you maybe give me,
like, a 20-minute warning,

1919
01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:13,433
you know, before the part
whereyou run away.

1920
01:25:13,536 --> 01:25:14,969
( chuckling )

1921
01:25:15,071 --> 01:25:18,097
Don't worry, I don't
have to leave yet.

1922
01:25:18,207 --> 01:25:20,471
Cool, because
I was thinking, um,

1923
01:25:20,576 --> 01:25:22,669
maybe we could go
kite surfing.

1924
01:25:22,778 --> 01:25:24,575
Like, there's this really,
really awesome place

1925
01:25:24,680 --> 01:25:26,511
right down the shore-
okay, the waves are small...

1926
01:25:26,616 --> 01:25:30,108
CLAI RE:
Uh, wait.

1927
01:25:30,219 --> 01:25:31,777
...it sprays up into the air

1928
01:25:31,888 --> 01:25:34,186
and you can, like,
always see a rainbow there.

1929
01:25:34,290 --> 01:25:35,348
We're losing them.

1930
01:25:35,458 --> 01:25:36,550
I think she's about to ask him.

1931
01:25:36,659 --> 01:25:39,219
- I can't hear.
- Shh!

1932
01:25:39,328 --> 01:25:41,626
Come on. Let's go up top.

1933
01:25:41,731 --> 01:25:43,323
I mean, that's...
ifyou want to do that.

1934
01:25:43,432 --> 01:25:45,297
- I want to. Yeah.
- Yeah?

1935
01:25:45,401 --> 01:25:48,802
Cool, 'cause then, afterwards,
um, I know this great little...

1936
01:25:48,905 --> 01:25:50,566
Uh, actually, it's a total dive,

1937
01:25:50,673 --> 01:25:53,437
but they have
the best hot dogs ever.

1938
01:25:53,542 --> 01:25:54,839
- Raymond...
- Yeah?

1939
01:25:54,944 --> 01:25:56,206
I have to askyou something.

1940
01:25:56,312 --> 01:25:57,802
oh, right,
right, yeah.

1941
01:25:57,914 --> 01:25:59,745
okay, shoot.

1942
01:25:59,849 --> 01:26:02,682
I came here
looking for something...

1943
01:26:02,785 --> 01:26:05,015
I wasn't even sure existed.

1944
01:26:05,121 --> 01:26:06,748
But...

1945
01:26:06,856 --> 01:26:10,815
then I metyou,
and now I have to askyou.

1946
01:26:10,927 --> 01:26:12,554
Ask me.

1947
01:26:12,662 --> 01:26:14,755
- Try the binoculars.
- Don'tyell at me.

1948
01:26:14,864 --> 01:26:17,332
Raymond...

1949
01:26:17,433 --> 01:26:18,730
Yeah?

1950
01:26:18,834 --> 01:26:21,064
Doyou love me?

1951
01:26:28,644 --> 01:26:30,168
Uh...

1952
01:26:30,279 --> 01:26:34,181
Well...

1953
01:26:35,284 --> 01:26:39,744
I mean... we've had one date.

1954
01:26:42,558 --> 01:26:43,422
What's going on?

1955
01:26:43,526 --> 01:26:45,517
But don't get me wrong,
don't get me wrong.

1956
01:26:45,628 --> 01:26:47,391
I like you.
I really, really likeyou.

1957
01:26:47,496 --> 01:26:50,431
Wait, I think he's, I think
he's reaching out for her.

1958
01:26:50,533 --> 01:26:52,558
That's a good sign. Look.

1959
01:26:52,668 --> 01:26:55,865
I mean, I think
you're smart and beautiful,

1960
01:26:55,972 --> 01:26:59,271
and different than
anyone I've ever met before,

1961
01:26:59,375 --> 01:27:01,036
and I'd like to see
a lot more ofyou.

1962
01:27:01,143 --> 01:27:06,479
But... you don't love me.

1963
01:27:06,582 --> 01:27:07,810
She's pulling away.

1964
01:27:07,917 --> 01:27:10,283
- Let me see what's going on.
- Wait, no.

1965
01:27:10,386 --> 01:27:11,648
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

1966
01:27:11,754 --> 01:27:12,880
Wait, wait, wait.

1967
01:27:12,989 --> 01:27:15,389
Hey... areyou crying?

1968
01:27:15,491 --> 01:27:19,621
Yes. Apparently,
it's something I do.

1969
01:27:19,729 --> 01:27:21,128
I don't understand.

1970
01:27:21,230 --> 01:27:23,494
I mean, why do I have
to be in love with you today?

1971
01:27:23,599 --> 01:27:24,500
Why can't we just...

1972
01:27:24,500 --> 01:27:24,898
Why can't we just...

1973
01:27:25,001 --> 01:27:25,899
- work ourway there?
- ( footsteps approaching )

1974
01:27:26,002 --> 01:27:27,128
CECI LIA:
I have a better idea.

1975
01:27:27,236 --> 01:27:29,397
Why doesn't she just go back
to where she came from?

1976
01:27:29,505 --> 01:27:30,597
( gasping )

1977
01:27:34,043 --> 01:27:35,635
- oh, no!
- No!

1978
01:27:35,745 --> 01:27:37,610
What the hell's
the matterwith you?

1979
01:27:44,387 --> 01:27:47,288
( gasps )

1980
01:27:58,067 --> 01:28:00,126
oh, my God.

1981
01:28:03,305 --> 01:28:07,264
Raymond! Raymond!

1982
01:28:07,376 --> 01:28:09,435
Just stay calm!
Don't fight the current.

1983
01:28:09,545 --> 01:28:10,944
I'll be
right there!

1984
01:28:12,815 --> 01:28:15,147
He still chooses her over me?

1985
01:28:15,251 --> 01:28:17,276
She's a fish!

1986
01:28:17,386 --> 01:28:18,978
( shrieks )

1987
01:28:19,088 --> 01:28:20,680
Raymond!

1988
01:28:20,790 --> 01:28:23,281
HAI LEY and CLAI RE:
Aqua! Aqua!

1989
01:28:23,392 --> 01:28:24,324
We're coming!

1990
01:28:24,427 --> 01:28:26,224
Her dad's
pulling her back.

1991
01:28:26,328 --> 01:28:27,886
RAY:
I'm going to get my rescue board!

1992
01:28:27,997 --> 01:28:29,897
We can't just let her go.

1993
01:28:29,999 --> 01:28:31,626
I'm going in.

1994
01:28:31,734 --> 01:28:33,793
No.

1995
01:28:36,439 --> 01:28:39,135
Not without me, you're not.

1996
01:28:55,524 --> 01:28:58,925
( gasping, coughing )

1997
01:28:59,028 --> 01:29:01,553
Hailey!

1998
01:29:01,664 --> 01:29:02,756
Hailey!

1999
01:29:02,865 --> 01:29:06,096
- Claire, come on.
- Hailey!

2000
01:29:06,202 --> 01:29:07,726
Claire!

2001
01:29:07,837 --> 01:29:09,998
Grab the buoy!
We'll meetyou there.

2002
01:29:12,475 --> 01:29:15,410
- ( coughing )
- I'm right here.

2003
01:29:15,511 --> 01:29:17,502
- I won't leave you.
- Hailey, I can't!

2004
01:29:17,613 --> 01:29:19,046
Keepyour eye on the buoy!

2005
01:29:19,148 --> 01:29:22,049
( grunting )

2006
01:29:25,955 --> 01:29:28,423
( coughing )

2007
01:29:28,524 --> 01:29:30,116
I'm coming.

2008
01:29:30,226 --> 01:29:32,023
Grab my hand.

2009
01:29:32,128 --> 01:29:33,459
Hailey!

2010
01:29:33,562 --> 01:29:34,551
You can do it.

2011
01:29:37,633 --> 01:29:38,998
I can't believe
you two.

2012
01:29:39,101 --> 01:29:40,864
It's not safe
out here.

2013
01:29:40,970 --> 01:29:42,801
The storm's
too strong.

2014
01:29:42,905 --> 01:29:45,203
Why is your dad
pulling you back now?

2015
01:29:45,307 --> 01:29:47,036
He can't just
takeyou away.

2016
01:29:47,143 --> 01:29:48,610
Yes, he can.

2017
01:29:48,711 --> 01:29:50,042
That was our deal.

2018
01:29:50,146 --> 01:29:51,636
Take ourwish...

2019
01:29:51,747 --> 01:29:54,113
- ( gasps )
- and you can stay here.

2020
01:29:56,018 --> 01:29:57,815
I can't.

2021
01:29:59,421 --> 01:30:01,116
Yeah, take it.

2022
01:30:01,223 --> 01:30:03,123
And you can call off
yourwedding.

2023
01:30:03,225 --> 01:30:04,954
But there's no wish.

2024
01:30:05,060 --> 01:30:09,793
- HAI LEY: What?!.
- Raymond doesn't love me.

2025
01:30:09,899 --> 01:30:11,594
My fatherwas right.

2026
01:30:11,700 --> 01:30:13,634
I couldn't prove love exists.

2027
01:30:13,736 --> 01:30:17,001
I'm so sorry.

2028
01:30:17,106 --> 01:30:19,233
- Can't we do something?!.
- Yeah, anything!

2029
01:30:19,341 --> 01:30:22,139
What more could you do for me?

2030
01:30:22,244 --> 01:30:25,441
You jumped
in the water to save me.

2031
01:30:25,548 --> 01:30:27,448
And nowyou'd
give meyourwish?

2032
01:30:27,550 --> 01:30:29,916
Whywould you do that for me?

2033
01:30:30,019 --> 01:30:32,317
I... I don't know.

2034
01:30:32,421 --> 01:30:34,946
I guess it's what
I would do for her, and...

2035
01:30:35,057 --> 01:30:36,820
I know she'd
do it for me,

2036
01:30:36,926 --> 01:30:40,020
and just...
because we loveyou, Aqua.

2037
01:30:40,129 --> 01:30:41,596
You do?

2038
01:30:49,238 --> 01:30:53,971
I didn't knowyou leak
when you're happy, too.

2039
01:31:02,251 --> 01:31:03,809
Look.

2040
01:31:13,462 --> 01:31:16,329
Your dad's
letting you go.

2041
01:31:16,432 --> 01:31:18,059
Because ofyou.

2042
01:31:18,167 --> 01:31:19,225
What?

2043
01:31:19,335 --> 01:31:21,064
Don'tyou see?

2044
01:31:21,170 --> 01:31:24,628
You just proved to him
that love exists.

2045
01:31:24,740 --> 01:31:27,343
( laughing )

2046
01:31:27,343 --> 01:31:27,365
( laughing )

2047
01:31:27,476 --> 01:31:29,341
I guess you get
a wish after all.

2048
01:31:29,445 --> 01:31:31,208
Any requests?

2049
01:31:33,115 --> 01:31:35,140
( chuckles )

2050
01:31:35,251 --> 01:31:38,982
Can we wish foryou
to stay here forever?

2051
01:31:40,723 --> 01:31:42,384
I'm a mermaid, Claire.

2052
01:31:42,491 --> 01:31:45,358
I have a family
out there that needs me.

2053
01:31:45,461 --> 01:31:46,985
Yeah.

2054
01:31:47,096 --> 01:31:48,393
As much as
I want to stay,

2055
01:31:48,497 --> 01:31:53,196
I belong in the ocean...
most ofthe time.

2056
01:31:56,472 --> 01:31:57,996
Saveyourwish, okay?

2057
01:31:58,107 --> 01:32:00,735
I promise
I'll come back to visit.

2058
01:32:00,843 --> 01:32:03,676
And ifl have to swim
against the GulfStream,

2059
01:32:03,779 --> 01:32:06,680
from here to Australia,
I'll do it.

2060
01:32:06,782 --> 01:32:09,751
I'd circle
theworld foryou two.

2061
01:32:18,861 --> 01:32:25,061
( quiet, gentle themeplaying )

2062
01:32:26,535 --> 01:32:30,562
So I guess this is it, right?

2063
01:32:32,474 --> 01:32:36,877
Someone's got to go back and
return all those wedding gifts.

2064
01:32:36,979 --> 01:32:38,947
We're gonna miss you, Aqua.

2065
01:32:41,817 --> 01:32:45,651
You can always
call me on my shell.

2066
01:32:45,754 --> 01:32:48,655
( laughing )

2067
01:32:48,757 --> 01:32:50,384
oh...

2068
01:32:50,492 --> 01:32:52,926
I wantyou guys to have these.

2069
01:32:55,097 --> 01:32:56,621
Thanks.

2070
01:32:56,732 --> 01:32:58,962
Starfish may be

2071
01:32:59,068 --> 01:33:01,002
big suck-ups...

2072
01:33:04,006 --> 01:33:06,440
...but they never lie.

2073
01:33:12,081 --> 01:33:13,548
Aqua...

2074
01:33:13,649 --> 01:33:16,482
I love you guys, too.

2075
01:33:16,585 --> 01:33:19,486
Aqua! Aqua!

2076
01:33:19,588 --> 01:33:21,419
( gasps )

2077
01:33:23,125 --> 01:33:25,150
( squeals )

2078
01:33:25,260 --> 01:33:27,228
- oh, my God.
- Keep in touch, fish-butt.

2079
01:33:27,329 --> 01:33:29,320
We want a full report.

2080
01:33:32,234 --> 01:33:33,326
I'll see you soon!

2081
01:33:33,435 --> 01:33:34,902
Bye.

2082
01:33:35,003 --> 01:33:36,197
Bye.

2083
01:33:36,305 --> 01:33:37,499
Bye.

2084
01:33:40,409 --> 01:33:42,309
- Race you to the pier.
- No, wait.

2085
01:33:42,411 --> 01:33:44,879
Let's just float a while.

2086
01:33:44,980 --> 01:33:46,948
I want to enjoy this.

2087
01:33:47,049 --> 01:33:50,644
Has this been the best summer
ever orwhat?

2088
01:33:50,753 --> 01:33:51,742
Just wait till next summer

2089
01:33:51,854 --> 01:33:53,788
when you guys come
to Australia and visit me.

2090
01:33:53,889 --> 01:33:56,016
I don't ifl can swing that
with my allowance.

2091
01:33:56,125 --> 01:33:59,390
Uh, Claire-
we still have ourwish.

2092
01:33:59,495 --> 01:34:01,292
oh, my God.

2093
01:34:01,397 --> 01:34:02,989
- You knowwhat, Hailey?
- Huh?

2094
01:34:03,098 --> 01:34:05,328
It's good to have
friends with fins.

2095
01:34:05,434 --> 01:34:07,026
- ( laughing )
- Hey!

2096
01:34:07,136 --> 01:34:09,127
( both laughing )

2097
01:34:09,238 --> 01:34:11,331
Wait up!

2098
01:34:12,574 --> 01:34:15,805
Wow. Wow, I ca... I ca...
I can't believe it.

2099
01:34:15,911 --> 01:34:17,776
Um, they didn't
exactly cover this

2100
01:34:17,880 --> 01:34:19,905
in lifeguard training.

2101
01:34:20,015 --> 01:34:22,108
I know.

2102
01:34:22,217 --> 01:34:23,775
I should have
told you.

2103
01:34:23,886 --> 01:34:26,013
I hopeyou're
not... mad.

2104
01:34:26,121 --> 01:34:29,284
No. No, I'm not...
I'm not mad.

2105
01:34:29,391 --> 01:34:31,188
S-Surprised, definitely,

2106
01:34:31,293 --> 01:34:33,557
and confused
about a couple ofthings-

2107
01:34:33,662 --> 01:34:38,656
Iike... for one,
the fact thatyou have a tail.

2108
01:34:38,767 --> 01:34:41,668
Yeah, I do.

2109
01:34:41,770 --> 01:34:44,170
A very nice one,
by the way.

2110
01:34:44,273 --> 01:34:45,501
( squeals )

2111
01:34:45,607 --> 01:34:48,041
I know.

2112
01:34:51,113 --> 01:34:56,608
Are you... planning
to surface any-anytime soon?

2113
01:34:56,718 --> 01:34:58,345
That sounds...

2114
01:34:58,454 --> 01:34:59,421
I don't know
what I'm talking about.

2115
01:34:59,521 --> 01:35:00,453
( clears throat )

2116
01:35:00,556 --> 01:35:04,356
I'm not sure
how to ask a mermaid out...

2117
01:35:04,460 --> 01:35:06,223
but I'd like
to seeyou again-

2118
01:35:06,328 --> 01:35:08,262
I mean, ifthat's...

2119
01:35:08,363 --> 01:35:11,423
allowed
or-or even possible.

2120
01:35:11,533 --> 01:35:14,661
Well, I have to swim
back for a bit...

2121
01:35:14,770 --> 01:35:17,500
clear the water
