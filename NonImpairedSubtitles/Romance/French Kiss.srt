Welcome to Air Canada,

2

Our flying time today is an estimated
seven hours, twenty minutes.

3
00:00:36,167 --> 00:00:41,036
Check that your seat belt is fastened and
your chair back is in the upright position.

4
00:00:41,127 --> 00:00:43,516
We will be taking off shortly.

5
00:00:44,607 --> 00:00:46,598
Kate...

6
00:00:48,607 --> 00:00:49,722
Yes?

7
00:00:49,807 --> 00:00:52,719
Are you prepared
to have a pleasant flight?

8
00:00:52,807 --> 00:00:54,286
Yes.

9
00:00:54,367 --> 00:00:57,439
Tell me, Kate.
What are you thinking about?

10
00:00:59,287 --> 00:01:01,403
Twisted steel.

11
00:01:01,487 --> 00:01:04,638
A ball of fire. A naked baby
screaming for his mother.

12
00:01:04,727 --> 00:01:08,003
Kate. What happened
to your little stone cottage?

13
00:01:08,087 --> 00:01:10,078
Picture it now.

14
00:01:10,167 --> 00:01:12,158
OK.

15
00:01:14,207 --> 00:01:16,198
Oh, my God.

16
00:01:16,287 --> 00:01:18,755
And don't forget your takeoff mantra.

17
00:01:18,847 --> 00:01:21,441
What are the words
you chant softly in your head?

18
00:01:21,527 --> 00:01:24,041
We're going down. We're going down...

19
00:01:24,127 --> 00:01:25,560
Kate.

20
00:01:27,287 --> 00:01:29,278
OK.

21
00:01:38,047 --> 00:01:41,835
I love Paris in the springtime

22
00:01:42,047 --> 00:01:43,480
I love...

23
00:01:44,327 --> 00:01:49,242
Hello? You know, I really think
you gave me the wrong mantra.

24
00:01:49,327 --> 00:01:54,526
I don't love Paris. I don't like the French
and I don't really wanna go on this trip.

25
00:01:57,487 --> 00:01:58,966
God, no.

26
00:01:59,047 --> 00:02:01,686
- Kate, you can do this.
- I can't do this.

27
00:02:01,767 --> 00:02:04,201
I don't belong on an airplane.

28
00:02:04,287 --> 00:02:07,882
Let me out! Let me out of here!

29
00:02:08,567 --> 00:02:10,717
I don't wanna die!

30
00:02:23,527 --> 00:02:25,836
Kate, your full refund.

31
00:02:28,807 --> 00:02:30,525
Thank you.

32
00:02:31,127 --> 00:02:34,085
- You can still get the money back.
- Money's not the issue.

33
00:02:34,167 --> 00:02:37,557
I wanted you to come with me to exper...

34
00:02:37,647 --> 00:02:39,638
What? Is that them?

35
00:02:39,727 --> 00:02:43,163
- I don't wanna see my family tonight.
- You never wanna see them.

36
00:02:43,247 --> 00:02:46,000
True. Since we're engaged,
they don't even knock.

37
00:02:46,087 --> 00:02:50,000
They care about you. In my family,
you just get that unsigned birthday card.

38
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:52,203
Kate, come to Paris with me.

39
00:02:52,287 --> 00:02:57,156
I'll give you 10mg of Valium and a shot of
Stoli. We'll be there before you know it.

40
00:02:58,687 --> 00:03:02,680
God. How can you not wanna go to Paris?
You're a history teacher.

41
00:03:02,767 --> 00:03:06,043
Charlie, the French. They hate us.

42
00:03:06,567 --> 00:03:10,765
They smoke. They have a relationship to
dairy products which I don't understand.

43
00:03:10,847 --> 00:03:14,044
Something's wrong with the cable.
I can't get the game.

44
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:16,118
Is the box set on three?

45
00:03:16,207 --> 00:03:19,438
- A week in Paris with the man you love?
- Suture demonstrations.

46
00:03:19,527 --> 00:03:21,757
- Midnight strolls?
- Medicare meetings.

47
00:03:21,847 --> 00:03:24,236
- The Eiffel Tower.
- The Eiffel Tower.

48
00:03:25,207 --> 00:03:27,846
- I'd love to see the Eiffel Tower.
- OK, then.

49
00:03:29,607 --> 00:03:31,484
Great.

50
00:03:31,567 --> 00:03:35,685
Charlie. I'm not supposed to leave the
country until my immigration interview.

51
00:03:35,767 --> 00:03:38,804
- I'm taking that.
- No, you're not.

52
00:03:38,887 --> 00:03:41,321
You can make something up.
They'll never know.

53
00:03:41,407 --> 00:03:43,523
Say your cousin Bridget fell in the Seine.

54
00:03:43,607 --> 00:03:46,644
They'll find out I don't have
a cousin Bridget and deport me.

55
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:49,002
It's like the one time I smoked pot.

56
00:03:49,087 --> 00:03:52,397
I didn't wanna do it in the first place.
I had a horrible time.

57
00:03:52,487 --> 00:03:56,116
Then Ronny Templeton's brother
called the police and we got arrested.

58
00:03:56,207 --> 00:03:58,926
The one time I ever did anything illegal.

59
00:04:00,127 --> 00:04:04,405
They put cheese on both pizzas.
Herb, this is you. You didn't check.

60
00:04:04,487 --> 00:04:06,762
Take it back.
You know Kate hates cheese.

61
00:04:06,847 --> 00:04:10,044
- I'll pick it off.
- Kate, here's the stuff I want from Paris.

62
00:04:10,127 --> 00:04:12,800
- Forget it. Kate's not going to Paris.
- I'm not going.

63
00:04:12,887 --> 00:04:17,039
- Why not? Is it the French thing?
- No. It's the flying thing.

64
00:04:17,127 --> 00:04:19,357
It's not the French or the flying.

65
00:04:19,447 --> 00:04:23,281
I can't leave the country until
my Canadian citizenship comes through.

66
00:04:23,367 --> 00:04:27,804
- Hon, we gotta move it.
- Kate. I almost forgot.

67
00:04:27,887 --> 00:04:31,004
The Merediths have put
their house on the market.

68
00:04:42,167 --> 00:04:44,840
Why are we looking at
a house we can't afford?

69
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:47,885
Charlie.
There's something I have to tell you.

70
00:04:47,967 --> 00:04:50,959
Since I turned 21,
I've been putting money aside,

71
00:04:51,047 --> 00:04:53,880
every week my adult life,
into a savings account

72
00:04:53,967 --> 00:04:58,358
which I then rolled into high-yield term
deposits with interest rates close to 14%.

73
00:04:58,447 --> 00:05:01,917
- What are you talking about?
- I've made us a nest egg.

74
00:05:03,967 --> 00:05:10,918
- How many eggs?
- 44,782 eggs.

75
00:05:11,007 --> 00:05:13,680
Why didn't you tell me this before?

76
00:05:15,167 --> 00:05:20,082
- I wanted it to be a surprise.
- It's a surprise. It's a big surprise.

77
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:26,003
So, with a little help from your
parents, we could probably afford this.

78
00:05:27,567 --> 00:05:32,357
My whole life is passing before my eyes
and we don't even have children yet.

79
00:05:58,167 --> 00:06:00,158
Come to Paris with me.

80
00:06:17,047 --> 00:06:19,436
Hi. Right on time.
Saved me from the news.

81
00:06:21,887 --> 00:06:25,926
- Hi, how's it going?
- Good. One conference after another.

82
00:06:26,007 --> 00:06:31,286
But this city, it's amazing, Kate.
It's so beautiful, it just casts a spell.

83
00:06:31,367 --> 00:06:33,961
- How was dinner?
- They used this sauce.

84
00:06:34,047 --> 00:06:38,518
It had a taste I've never experienced!
C'est incroyable.

85
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:41,997
Charlie, the sauces have to be
incroyable to cover up the horse meat.

86
00:06:42,087 --> 00:06:43,805
I saw it on 60 Minutes...

87
00:06:43,887 --> 00:06:47,084
You keep watching those shows,
you'll never leave the house.

88
00:06:57,407 --> 00:07:01,719
I can't talk right now. I'm with some of the
guys at this hip club. I can't hear too well.

89
00:07:01,807 --> 00:07:04,082
Sweetie pie,
we need to talk about the house.

90
00:07:04,167 --> 00:07:07,682
I know. I promise you, tomorrow.
I gotta go, hon. Love you. Bye.

91
00:07:14,287 --> 00:07:18,360
So I talked to the broker and I told her
we are ready to put in an offer

92
00:07:18,447 --> 00:07:20,438
as soon as I talk to Charlie.

93
00:07:20,527 --> 00:07:22,563
You guys are crazy.

94
00:07:22,647 --> 00:07:26,640
I'm never gonna buy a house
or anything else worth anything.

95
00:07:26,727 --> 00:07:27,716
Why not?

96
00:07:27,807 --> 00:07:30,924
You think you own something like that
and it winds up owning you.

97
00:07:31,007 --> 00:07:34,920
It becomes your entire life, then someone
forgets to put out their cigarette

98
00:07:35,007 --> 00:07:38,841
and it all burns to the ground.

99
00:07:40,167 --> 00:07:42,727
- Honey, hello.
- Kate.

100
00:07:42,807 --> 00:07:47,119
Yeah, it's me, Charlie.
Are you all right? Is something wrong?

101
00:07:47,207 --> 00:07:50,085
No. Yeah. Something's happened.

102
00:07:50,167 --> 00:07:52,840
- What? What's wrong?
- Kate.

103
00:07:52,927 --> 00:07:55,043
I'm just so happy.

104
00:07:55,127 --> 00:07:58,642
You know, I'm just so happy
and so... fucked up.

105
00:07:58,727 --> 00:08:03,323
I fucked up, definitely.
But it's destiny, Kate. That's what it is.

106
00:08:04,287 --> 00:08:08,246
- What are you saying? What's destiny?
- Destiny? Yeah. OK.

107
00:08:08,327 --> 00:08:12,843
Well, I met this woman.
This apparition, this goddesse.

108
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:17,285
- Goddesse?
- It's French for goddess.

109
00:08:17,367 --> 00:08:21,838
And so is she, Kate. She's French.
I've never ever felt this way before.

110
00:08:21,927 --> 00:08:25,681
Like I could do anything. I could rule
the world, climb the highest mountain.

111
00:08:25,767 --> 00:08:30,397
I could walk into a men's room and pee,
even with some big guy in line behind me.

112
00:08:30,487 --> 00:08:33,604
What? What are you saying?

113
00:08:33,687 --> 00:08:35,564
Charlie... Are you...

114
00:08:35,647 --> 00:08:37,638
I'm not coming back.

115
00:08:38,447 --> 00:08:40,438
I'm in love.

116
00:08:42,487 --> 00:08:45,559
Love, like in a sonnet. Or in a movie.

117
00:08:45,647 --> 00:08:48,719
Or like a...

118
00:08:49,647 --> 00:08:52,002
Like... love.

119
00:08:55,487 --> 00:08:57,603
I'm sorry, Kate.

120
00:08:58,607 --> 00:09:00,598
I'm so sorry.

121
00:09:09,847 --> 00:09:11,838
Charlie.

122
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:17,197
Welcome to Air Canada,
nonstop service to Paris.

123
00:09:17,287 --> 00:09:20,518
Our flying time is an estimated
seven hours, twenty minutes.

124
00:09:21,087 --> 00:09:26,115
Ensure your seat belt is fastened and that
your chair back is in the upright position.

125
00:09:26,207 --> 00:09:30,200
We'll be taking off shortly.
We hope you have a pleasant flight.

126
00:09:53,847 --> 00:09:57,760
I hate Paris in the springtime

127
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:01,283
I hate Paris in the fall

128
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:06,157
I hate Paris in the summer when it sizzles

129
00:10:06,247 --> 00:10:10,240
I hate Paris in the winter when it drizzles

130
00:10:10,327 --> 00:10:12,363
I hate Paris

131
00:10:12,447 --> 00:10:15,678
Oh why, oh why do I hate Paris?

132
00:10:15,767 --> 00:10:18,918
Because my love is there...

133
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:22,716
With his slut girlfriend!

134
00:10:28,647 --> 00:10:32,117
This is my first time flying.
I'm just kinda nervous.

135
00:10:32,807 --> 00:10:34,798
First time.

136
00:10:36,807 --> 00:10:41,358
Do you speak any English? Did your
mother ever teach you about staring?

137
00:10:41,447 --> 00:10:46,726
What do you think? The plane is going to
crash and we are all on the ground dead?

138
00:10:46,807 --> 00:10:50,402
I promise you, if it happens,
you won't feel a thing.

139
00:10:51,287 --> 00:10:53,676
You're French, aren't you?

140
00:10:53,767 --> 00:10:57,806
Luc Teyssier. I'm curious. How
have you got around your whole life?

141
00:10:57,887 --> 00:11:00,242
Do you stay in your house
with the doors locked?

142
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:03,956
I get around as nature intended...
in a car.

143
00:11:10,287 --> 00:11:12,642
What did she say? That sounded serious.

144
00:11:12,727 --> 00:11:17,642
The pilot says there is a crack
in the engine, but he take off anyway.

145
00:11:17,727 --> 00:11:20,719
Please remember
that the use of cellular phones

146
00:11:20,807 --> 00:11:25,437
and other electronic devices
is forbidden during takeoff.

147
00:11:28,047 --> 00:11:32,279
I don't know what you learnt in France,
but rude and interesting are not the same.

148
00:11:34,007 --> 00:11:35,156
God!

149
00:11:58,167 --> 00:12:01,523
- We hope you enjoy the flight.
- OK.

150
00:12:04,167 --> 00:12:06,886
Folks, we're about third in line for takeoff.

151
00:12:06,967 --> 00:12:10,960
Just relax. We should be in the air
in just a couple of minutes.

152
00:12:11,927 --> 00:12:15,966
I've almost got the stone cottage going,
so could you please stop looking at me?

153
00:12:16,047 --> 00:12:18,686
- Is incredible.
- What?

154
00:12:18,767 --> 00:12:23,477
Your every muscle in your body is tense.
Even the lids of your eyes.

155
00:12:23,567 --> 00:12:26,445
Your nostrils are closing up.
How do you do that?

156
00:12:26,527 --> 00:12:29,724
Me, I love to fly. Especially this moment.

157
00:12:29,807 --> 00:12:34,756
The plane getting ready to charge
the runway. The engines screaming.

158
00:12:34,847 --> 00:12:39,318
The pressure building. The force of it
slams you back in the seat.

159
00:12:39,407 --> 00:12:43,082
And then... you are in the air.

160
00:12:43,167 --> 00:12:45,840
Everything else is behind you.

161
00:12:45,927 --> 00:12:49,920
There's only one other place in life
where I feel this kind of exhilaration.

162
00:12:50,007 --> 00:12:51,645
- Where's that?
- It is...

163
00:12:51,727 --> 00:12:55,037
No. Don't tell me. Just let me guess.

164
00:12:55,527 --> 00:12:58,325
Flight attendants, prepare for takeoff.

165
00:12:58,407 --> 00:13:01,365
Oh, God. I don't think I can do this.

166
00:13:08,207 --> 00:13:10,675
Did you ever think
maybe it is not the airplane?

167
00:13:10,767 --> 00:13:14,726
- What's not the airplane?
- Maybe it is something else you fear?

168
00:13:14,807 --> 00:13:16,684
- What do you mean?
- Do I have to say it?

169
00:13:16,767 --> 00:13:20,282
- Will I be able to stop you?
- It is obvious it is not the plane you fear.

170
00:13:20,367 --> 00:13:22,358
- I know your type.
- What type is that?

171
00:13:22,447 --> 00:13:25,007
- You're afraid to live. Really live.
- Oh, God.

172
00:13:25,087 --> 00:13:30,366
You are afraid of life. You are afraid
of love. You are afraid of sex.

173
00:13:30,447 --> 00:13:33,519
- That is ridiculous.
- I can tell from your face.

174
00:13:33,607 --> 00:13:36,758
The way you dress,
your little white buttons all the way...

175
00:13:36,847 --> 00:13:39,566
- Get away.
- You're the kind of woman in bed...

176
00:13:39,647 --> 00:13:42,241
You wait under the covers,
the light goes off.

177
00:13:42,327 --> 00:13:45,558
- Then, like a rabbit...
- What?

178
00:13:45,647 --> 00:13:47,717
- What is the matter with you?
- I know...

179
00:13:47,807 --> 00:13:50,116
You don't know me or anything about me.

180
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:53,165
- You are afraid.
- And Charlie never complained.

181
00:13:53,247 --> 00:13:57,126
Stop it. There were those couple of
months where I just didn't feel like it.

182
00:13:57,207 --> 00:14:01,041
But that was a long time ago
and I was in-between teaching jobs.

183
00:14:01,127 --> 00:14:05,359
Yes. And for you to sit there
with that smug expression and tell me...

184
00:14:21,407 --> 00:14:27,243
Look at you. Just some nicotine-saturated
and hygiene-deficient Frenchman.

185
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:31,484
Look. What a fantastic view.

186
00:14:37,487 --> 00:14:41,605
Now if you will excuse me,
I must go do as nature intended.

187
00:15:02,287 --> 00:15:05,996
Sir, I'm sorry.
There's no smoking on this plane.

188
00:15:06,087 --> 00:15:08,726
OK. Then can I have two glasses with ice?

189
00:15:30,367 --> 00:15:32,961
Excuse me. Can I ask you something?

190
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:35,878
It's Luke, isn't it?

191
00:15:35,967 --> 00:15:38,117
- Luc.
- Luke.

192
00:15:38,207 --> 00:15:40,277
No, not Luke. Luc.

193
00:15:40,367 --> 00:15:42,358
Luc.

194
00:15:43,967 --> 00:15:46,765
- You want to ask me something or not?
- No. Forget it.

195
00:15:46,847 --> 00:15:49,725
- I forget already.
- This is the thing.

196
00:15:49,807 --> 00:15:54,039
When you said all that stuff, did you mean
it or were you trying to make me angry?

197
00:15:54,127 --> 00:15:57,403
Do I look like someone who
doesn't know how to have a good time?

198
00:15:58,167 --> 00:16:01,477
You were how old when you lost it?

199
00:16:02,287 --> 00:16:06,519
- It? What it?
- You know. It. Your flower.

200
00:16:06,607 --> 00:16:09,917
My flower?
My flower is none of your business.

201
00:16:10,007 --> 00:16:14,523
I ask you because some people,
they rush toward the fateful moment,

202
00:16:14,607 --> 00:16:16,802
the body is bursting to discover.

203
00:16:16,887 --> 00:16:20,641
Others, they guard it like some
precious gift, and they wait and wait.

204
00:16:20,727 --> 00:16:22,957
- You, I suppose, rushed?
- Like a bull.

205
00:16:23,767 --> 00:16:26,645
- I have a picture in my mind. Very clear.
- A young bull.

206
00:16:26,727 --> 00:16:28,843
- How young?
- 13.

207
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:31,043
13!

208
00:16:31,127 --> 00:16:35,598
No, you are right. I was 12.
Magda. She was a putain.

209
00:16:35,687 --> 00:16:39,157
A prostitute.
She lived just outside of my town.

210
00:16:39,247 --> 00:16:45,117
Just by a little bridge. She was not
beautiful, but she had this mouth...

211
00:16:45,207 --> 00:16:47,516
There was another world waiting there.

212
00:16:47,607 --> 00:16:51,964
But I did not have the money for
the kissing, only for the... you know.

213
00:16:52,047 --> 00:16:55,642
- I don't understand.
- To kiss a prostitute, it costs more.

214
00:16:56,927 --> 00:17:00,203
That makes sense. A kiss is so intimate.

215
00:17:00,287 --> 00:17:04,075
You could probably disconnect
from everything else, but a kiss...

216
00:17:04,167 --> 00:17:08,957
Two people's lips together,
their breath, a little bit of their soul.

217
00:17:14,327 --> 00:17:17,125
All I mean is that
a kiss is where the romance is.

218
00:17:17,207 --> 00:17:19,437
That is what I thought back then.

219
00:17:19,527 --> 00:17:22,519
So the next day, I stole 40 francs
from my brother Antoine.

220
00:17:22,607 --> 00:17:26,600
I went back and kissed Magda
for half an hour. It was very good.

221
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:30,238
Now you.

222
00:17:30,887 --> 00:17:34,197
- Now me what?
- Your turn. I tell you. Now you tell me.

223
00:17:34,287 --> 00:17:36,278
I am all ears.

224
00:17:36,367 --> 00:17:38,517
All right, yeah.

225
00:17:38,607 --> 00:17:40,438
No, I didn't...

226
00:17:40,527 --> 00:17:43,803
I didn't rush. You were right.
But I didn't hide from it either.

227
00:17:43,887 --> 00:17:46,037
I wanted it to be great. I was...

228
00:17:46,807 --> 00:17:48,445
18.

229
00:17:48,527 --> 00:17:52,884
Jeff the jock.
My basement. Valentine's Day.

230
00:17:52,967 --> 00:17:55,197
Jeopardy! in the background.

231
00:17:55,287 --> 00:17:58,962
- It's a game show on TV.
- Jeopardy! We have it.

232
00:17:59,047 --> 00:18:03,120
Jeff said it would last longer
with the show on to distract him.

233
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:06,438
He got all the answers wrong
except for sports.

234
00:18:06,527 --> 00:18:11,442
By Double Jeopardy, he was done. By
Final Jeopardy, he was on his way home.

235
00:18:11,527 --> 00:18:13,882
So. Yeah. The first time was bad.

236
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:19,360
But since then, it's been good and then I
found somebody special, so it was great.

237
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:24,276
Can I ask you something?

238
00:18:25,327 --> 00:18:29,002
Do you believe in love,
the kind that lasts for ever?

239
00:18:31,007 --> 00:18:33,441
- I loved my mother.
- No.

240
00:18:33,527 --> 00:18:36,519
Everybody loves their mother.
Even people who hate them.

241
00:18:36,607 --> 00:18:39,440
The question is,
one man meant for one woman.

242
00:18:39,527 --> 00:18:41,961
But it is not an interesting question.

243
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:45,483
It is the question of a little girl
who believes in fairy tales.

244
00:18:45,567 --> 00:18:47,558
No. It's an everyone question.

245
00:18:47,647 --> 00:18:53,279
Everybody thinks they have the answer
until one day... something happens.

246
00:18:53,367 --> 00:18:55,562
Something happened?

247
00:18:59,127 --> 00:19:01,118
I understand.

248
00:19:01,207 --> 00:19:05,678
One love for you would be like having
to eat home for the rest of your life.

249
00:19:05,767 --> 00:19:10,204
And you probably like to go out to a
different restaurant every chance you get.

250
00:19:11,247 --> 00:19:12,043
Careful.

251
00:19:12,127 --> 00:19:15,597
- What's that? Are you hiding something?
- I hide nothing.

252
00:19:15,687 --> 00:19:18,155
- Excuse me.
- I'm sorry.

253
00:19:18,247 --> 00:19:20,522
- No. I have to go again.
- Again?

254
00:20:33,287 --> 00:20:35,278
Why did you let me drink so much?

255
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:38,484
I did not let you do anything.
You did it yourself.

256
00:20:39,367 --> 00:20:44,600
I will give you a ride into Paris. It will
save you a lot of money, believe me.

257
00:20:45,607 --> 00:20:48,519
After what we have
been through together...

258
00:20:48,607 --> 00:20:51,758
- Where are you staying?
- George V.

259
00:20:56,327 --> 00:20:59,922
"Nothing to declare." That is you.
Me, they always stop.

260
00:21:00,007 --> 00:21:03,841
I'll meet you outside.
One minute, maximum. Go ahead.

261
00:21:09,527 --> 00:21:12,678
Your passport and plane ticket.

262
00:21:17,127 --> 00:21:19,118
Would you open your bag?

263
00:21:20,207 --> 00:21:21,526
Wait for me.

264
00:21:22,767 --> 00:21:25,327
That won't be necessary.

265
00:21:25,407 --> 00:21:27,398
What are you doing here?

266
00:21:27,487 --> 00:21:30,718
Don't you think a cop gets a vacation?

267
00:21:32,087 --> 00:21:33,884
Give him back his papers.

268
00:21:43,207 --> 00:21:46,119
Look, there's Louise.

269
00:21:48,447 --> 00:21:51,883
I need a taxi to the George V, Paris.

270
00:21:54,287 --> 00:21:59,680
- I'll call you Monday. We'll have a drink.
- Why wait till Monday?

271
00:22:00,887 --> 00:22:02,525
I've got something...

272
00:22:05,007 --> 00:22:06,884
Never mind. Let's go.

273
00:22:16,287 --> 00:22:20,519
Papa, why are you looking
through the man's things?

274
00:22:20,607 --> 00:22:23,599
The same reason I look through
your room when you're asleep.

275
00:22:23,687 --> 00:22:26,440
To protect my loved ones
from themselves.

276
00:22:26,527 --> 00:22:30,236
- You won't find anything in there.
- Are you really a thief?

277
00:22:30,327 --> 00:22:32,682
A thief? Me?

278
00:22:34,367 --> 00:22:39,316
- Daddy says you saved his life.
- It's true. You see this little scar?

279
00:22:39,407 --> 00:22:42,524
Luc stopped it from going
all the way over here.

280
00:22:42,607 --> 00:22:45,246
He's no criminal.
That's what I keep telling him.

281
00:22:45,607 --> 00:22:47,598
To the left, Louise!

282
00:23:07,047 --> 00:23:09,356
- Do you speak any English?
- Of course, madam.

283
00:23:09,447 --> 00:23:12,359
This is the George V.
Not some backpacker's hov-el.

284
00:23:12,447 --> 00:23:15,917
Hov-el. Of course not.

285
00:23:16,007 --> 00:23:19,966
Could you tell me which room
Charlie Lytton is staying in, please?

286
00:23:20,047 --> 00:23:22,720
Dr Charles Lytton. He's expecting me.

287
00:23:22,807 --> 00:23:24,843
I'm afraid, non.

288
00:23:25,327 --> 00:23:27,443
- Non?
- No, madam.

289
00:23:27,527 --> 00:23:30,678
Perhaps madam could try
the courtesy phone?

290
00:23:31,287 --> 00:23:33,596
Well, madam has tried
the courtesy phone.

291
00:23:33,687 --> 00:23:35,962
Do not disturb.

292
00:23:37,887 --> 00:23:45,316
Look. I just spent seven hours
on an airplane crossing an ocean.

293
00:23:45,407 --> 00:23:48,763
I'm tired and I'm hungry
and I just wanna see my fiance.

294
00:23:48,847 --> 00:23:50,883
Now, are you gonna help me or not?

295
00:23:50,967 --> 00:23:55,722
Madam, it is my duty as concierge
to safeguard the privacy of our guests.

296
00:23:55,807 --> 00:23:59,720
And if our guests need safeguarding
from their own fiancees, well,

297
00:23:59,807 --> 00:24:05,006
after all, unlike some countries, France
is not a nation of puritanical hypocrites.

298
00:24:20,607 --> 00:24:23,121
I just gave you 100 francs.

299
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:25,725
And I took it.

300
00:24:25,807 --> 00:24:29,959
And if there is anything else
I can do to help, please let me know.

301
00:25:04,207 --> 00:25:06,198
You are American, no?

302
00:25:09,647 --> 00:25:12,400
- For the moment.
- Well, forgive me for intruding,

303
00:25:12,487 --> 00:25:15,559
but I saw you sitting here
looking a little sad.

304
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:20,323
"Why should such a beautiful woman
look so sad?" I ask myself.

305
00:25:20,407 --> 00:25:24,844
- Have you got an hour?
- As a matter of fact... always.

306
00:25:26,727 --> 00:25:29,446
Let me help you to forget your sadness.

307
00:25:29,527 --> 00:25:32,803
And remember that you are in Paris,
city of love.

308
00:25:33,767 --> 00:25:36,122
- Can I ask you something?
- Of course.

309
00:25:36,327 --> 00:25:39,956
Can you urinate
with someone standing right behind you?

310
00:25:41,167 --> 00:25:43,601
I think I could manage it.

311
00:25:46,847 --> 00:25:49,441
Are you going to be the someone?

312
00:25:51,687 --> 00:25:54,520
Me? No! That's not what I meant.

313
00:25:55,487 --> 00:26:01,483
So... you would like that I arrange
for someone else to stand next to me?

314
00:26:01,807 --> 00:26:05,800
It could be arranged.
Perhaps Pierre? Monique?

315
00:26:06,727 --> 00:26:08,718
You have the face of an angel.

316
00:26:08,807 --> 00:26:12,083
I'm delighted to find
the mind is a little devil.

317
00:26:13,127 --> 00:26:14,606
Look, mister.

318
00:26:14,687 --> 00:26:18,157
This is gonna get you nowhere.
I am waiting to meet my fiance.

319
00:26:18,247 --> 00:26:21,444
If he sees you bothering me,
even talking to me,

320
00:26:21,527 --> 00:26:24,405
he's gonna walk over here and he...

321
00:27:10,287 --> 00:27:12,847
What are you doing here?
You only work the metro.

322
00:27:12,927 --> 00:27:16,522
No more. With this suit, I'm a new man.

323
00:27:24,167 --> 00:27:26,158
Charlie?

324
00:27:28,767 --> 00:27:30,962
You said you'd give me a ride.

325
00:27:31,047 --> 00:27:35,120
- You said... Where are we?
- In your hotel. I'll take you to your room.

326
00:27:35,207 --> 00:27:37,960
I don't have a room.
Someone has taken my room.

327
00:27:38,047 --> 00:27:41,119
Someone in four-inch heels, a red dress...

328
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:45,364
Oh, my God! My bags!

329
00:27:45,447 --> 00:27:47,677
- What?
- My bags are gone.

330
00:27:47,767 --> 00:27:50,725
What do you mean, they are gone?
How can they be gone?

331
00:27:50,807 --> 00:27:55,278
What are you looking under there for?
I didn't lose my keys. I lost my suitcase.

332
00:27:55,367 --> 00:27:58,006
Where did you put them down? Think.

333
00:27:58,087 --> 00:28:01,921
I fainted right there.
My money, my passport.

334
00:28:02,007 --> 00:28:03,884
- My vitamins.
- May I be of service?

335
00:28:07,527 --> 00:28:09,995
Yeah, you tell him.

336
00:28:10,087 --> 00:28:12,043
How could you let this happen?

337
00:28:12,127 --> 00:28:15,039
- What is your problem? They're my bags.
- But you could...

338
00:28:15,127 --> 00:28:18,278
I'm upset because it is my country
and this is a scandal.

339
00:28:18,367 --> 00:28:21,279
- Do you remember anything?
- I was sitting here.

340
00:28:21,367 --> 00:28:24,598
That guy came and talked to me
and then...

341
00:28:25,087 --> 00:28:27,282
I saw Charlie.

342
00:28:27,367 --> 00:28:29,517
Here we go again. Here, sit.

343
00:28:29,607 --> 00:28:32,440
Breathe in. Breathe out. Breathe in.

344
00:28:32,527 --> 00:28:35,200
I'm breathing. All men are bastards.

345
00:28:35,287 --> 00:28:37,482
Not all. Some are just trying to help.

346
00:28:37,567 --> 00:28:42,277
I never thought I'd be the type to say
this, but it's true. All men are bastards.

347
00:28:42,367 --> 00:28:44,597
The guy who was talking to you. He was...

348
00:28:44,687 --> 00:28:47,918
A bastard.
A Eurotrash in Armani kind of bastard.

349
00:28:48,007 --> 00:28:50,202
In a black suit with a yellow shirt?

350
00:28:50,287 --> 00:28:51,606
Yeah.

351
00:28:51,687 --> 00:28:54,042
You know him? Of course you know him.

352
00:28:54,127 --> 00:28:56,687
All you bastards know each other.

353
00:28:57,047 --> 00:28:59,515
Bastard.

354
00:29:01,407 --> 00:29:03,716
All right. You wait here.

355
00:29:03,807 --> 00:29:08,198
I go get a... my car
and we go get your stuff, OK?

356
00:29:48,607 --> 00:29:52,805
- So who is this guy who stole my bags?
- Bub.

357
00:29:52,967 --> 00:29:55,606
- Bub?
- No. Bub.

358
00:29:55,687 --> 00:29:58,121
Bub, like Bub Dylan.

359
00:29:58,207 --> 00:30:01,040
- Bob.
- Bob.

360
00:30:01,327 --> 00:30:03,887
- Now, why are you helping me?
- Why?

361
00:30:04,967 --> 00:30:07,606
Because I like you. I do.

362
00:30:08,487 --> 00:30:12,719
But I don't like the way that you say on
the plane, with your face scranched up,

363
00:30:12,847 --> 00:30:14,803
"You're French, aren't you?"

364
00:30:14,887 --> 00:30:19,517
I don't like the way you say, with your
eyes all squinty, "All men are bastards."

365
00:30:19,607 --> 00:30:21,598
Scranched?

366
00:30:32,207 --> 00:30:34,402
Please, don't break the car, OK?

367
00:30:42,767 --> 00:30:45,122
OK. So I try to understand.

368
00:30:45,207 --> 00:30:47,960
He tells you he has met this woman...

369
00:30:48,047 --> 00:30:50,197
No, this... goddess.

370
00:30:50,287 --> 00:30:53,723
He breaks your heart. He hu...

371
00:30:53,807 --> 00:30:56,401
Hurts me. Humbles me.

372
00:30:56,487 --> 00:30:58,478
- Humiliates you.
- Humiliates me.

373
00:30:58,567 --> 00:31:02,037
OK, and then you come here to Paris
so that he can do it again,

374
00:31:02,127 --> 00:31:04,118
but this time right in your face.

375
00:31:04,207 --> 00:31:06,357
No.

376
00:31:08,527 --> 00:31:12,520
No. I come to Paris
to get back the man that I love.

377
00:31:12,607 --> 00:31:15,565
Is that so hard to understand,
even for a person like you?

378
00:31:15,647 --> 00:31:20,198
- OK, and meanwhile his lover...
- Don't ever use that word again.

379
00:31:20,287 --> 00:31:25,042
This bastard woman,
she's feeling something else, maybe?

380
00:31:25,847 --> 00:31:30,682
Once he saw me, myself, moi, everything
would change, the spell would be broken.

381
00:31:32,167 --> 00:31:34,681
You don't think
I could change his mind? I could.

382
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:38,157
I would remind him of our life together.
We had a pertect life.

383
00:31:38,247 --> 00:31:41,045
- Evidently.
- I've never been so happy.

384
00:31:41,127 --> 00:31:44,005
When someone says they are happy,
my ass begins to twitch.

385
00:31:44,087 --> 00:31:47,443
We had plans, OK?
We had plans for a home and a family.

386
00:31:47,527 --> 00:31:51,156
- I would remind him of that.
- He was obviously very attached to them.

387
00:31:51,887 --> 00:31:55,357
- If all else failed...
- You'd get down on your knees and beg?

388
00:31:55,447 --> 00:31:57,677
- It's possible.
- Now I can see it.

389
00:31:57,767 --> 00:32:01,123
There is the goddess,
standing next to Charlie, in her negligee.

390
00:32:01,207 --> 00:32:03,675
And you are there on your knees,
begging.

391
00:32:03,767 --> 00:32:06,361
Poor Charlie. Tough decision.

392
00:32:13,647 --> 00:32:16,684
- I didn't beg.
- No. You fainted.

393
00:32:29,247 --> 00:32:32,080
I see how far you'd go
for the love of your life.

394
00:32:32,807 --> 00:32:36,720
If you know so much about women, why
was no one at the airport to greet you?

395
00:32:36,807 --> 00:32:40,720
- Oh, please. I'm finished with women.
- You haven't found the right one?

396
00:32:40,807 --> 00:32:43,844
- I have found plenty of them.
- You're afraid of commitment.

397
00:32:43,927 --> 00:32:47,476
- I'm not afraid of anything.
- I know your problem. No staying power.

398
00:32:47,567 --> 00:32:49,922
- What do you mean?
- You can't stick it out.

399
00:32:50,007 --> 00:32:52,123
- It's obvious.
- It is?

400
00:32:52,207 --> 00:32:54,960
You are afraid of commitment.

401
00:32:55,047 --> 00:32:57,925
Commitment.
OK, sorry. I thought you meant...

402
00:32:58,007 --> 00:33:00,521
- What did you think...
- Nothing. Forget it.

403
00:33:01,487 --> 00:33:04,206
- This problem.
- It's not a problem.

404
00:33:04,287 --> 00:33:07,040
For you, Luc?
Every man goes through that.

405
00:33:07,127 --> 00:33:10,915
I mean, Charlie never did,
but it's usually an issue of self-esteem.

406
00:33:11,247 --> 00:33:15,479
It's just a very recent phenomenon, OK?
I've been under a lot of pressure recently.

407
00:33:15,567 --> 00:33:17,922
Soon, it will all be over.

408
00:33:18,007 --> 00:33:22,762
And then, zip, boom, bonjour!
I am back in business. OK?

409
00:33:32,207 --> 00:33:34,767
- Bob, great to see you.
- Hi, Luc.

410
00:33:34,847 --> 00:33:36,599
You've met my friend Kate?

411
00:33:36,687 --> 00:33:38,678
Hello, again.

412
00:33:42,607 --> 00:33:44,598
Where's the rest?

413
00:33:49,687 --> 00:33:52,121
What about my money and my passport?

414
00:33:53,767 --> 00:33:56,804
Forget the passport. He sold it.
First thing to go.

415
00:33:59,007 --> 00:34:02,636
What about my suitcase and my clothes?
Ask him about my vitamins.

416
00:34:03,887 --> 00:34:06,117
Her clothes?

417
00:34:06,207 --> 00:34:07,925
I gave them to Monique.

418
00:34:08,367 --> 00:34:11,120
- Monique?
- What? What did he say?

419
00:34:11,567 --> 00:34:13,558
He threw them away.

420
00:34:14,527 --> 00:34:17,041
Oh... God!

421
00:34:17,127 --> 00:34:19,800
Oh... man!

422
00:34:25,087 --> 00:34:26,725
What? No, thank you.

423
00:34:29,087 --> 00:34:31,806
You got rid of everything?

424
00:34:36,727 --> 00:34:38,718
Except for that...

425
00:35:00,007 --> 00:35:03,363
- You hid a plant in my bag.
- It's not just a plant. It is a vine.

426
00:35:03,447 --> 00:35:06,564
That's why you're helping me.
You don't give a shit about me.

427
00:35:06,647 --> 00:35:10,435
Look, I'm sorry you lost all your stuff
but it was not me who stole it.

428
00:35:10,527 --> 00:35:15,123
What if I had gotten stopped at customs?
Did you ever think of that?

429
00:35:15,207 --> 00:35:18,438
Don't be ridiculous.
People like you they don't stop.

430
00:35:18,527 --> 00:35:20,802
Why do you think I choose you?
Look at you.

431
00:35:20,887 --> 00:35:23,082
You would declare a pack
of chewing gum.

432
00:35:23,167 --> 00:35:25,158
Please, don't ever, ever...

433
00:35:26,807 --> 00:35:28,798
Never touch my vine.

434
00:35:29,647 --> 00:35:32,923
You don't understand. This is my future.

435
00:35:33,007 --> 00:35:37,478
With this vine, I'm going to make a great
vineyard and get out of this shithole.

436
00:35:37,567 --> 00:35:41,355
Donnez-moi un break. You can't make
a vineyard out of one vine.

437
00:35:41,447 --> 00:35:43,039
No, not one vine.

438
00:35:43,127 --> 00:35:47,598
I take this little American vine, mix it with
some others and I make something new.

439
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:50,076
I don't care.

440
00:35:50,167 --> 00:35:53,921
Why am I listening to you? It's bullshit.
Everything with you is bullshit.

441
00:35:54,007 --> 00:35:58,285
OK, fine. Go home. Find yourself
a nice little boy you can boss around.

442
00:35:58,367 --> 00:36:01,006
But don't let him
out of your sight for long.

443
00:36:01,087 --> 00:36:06,161
How am I supposed to do that?
I have no money, no ticket, no passport.

444
00:36:06,647 --> 00:36:09,036
- Here. Take this.
- No. I don't want your money.

445
00:36:09,127 --> 00:36:13,598
- It is yours. It is what he got for your stuff.
- I don't want your money.

446
00:36:13,687 --> 00:36:16,599
Now go away. Stop following me.

447
00:36:17,767 --> 00:36:19,758
OK.

448
00:37:12,967 --> 00:37:15,037
What necklace?

449
00:37:15,127 --> 00:37:17,118
I didn't see any necklace!

450
00:37:17,207 --> 00:37:19,198
It must still be in her bag!

451
00:37:20,287 --> 00:37:22,084
In her bag?

452
00:38:58,887 --> 00:39:03,722
I see that you are a resident of Canada,
and are applying for Canadian citizenship.

453
00:39:04,047 --> 00:39:08,165
- My fiance is Canadian.
- Let me ask you something.

454
00:39:08,247 --> 00:39:12,559
You no longer want to be an American but
expect me to give you a new passport?

455
00:39:14,447 --> 00:39:16,324
Is this a trick question?

456
00:39:16,407 --> 00:39:20,685
I need to see your Canadian resident visa
before I can process your application.

457
00:39:20,767 --> 00:39:22,644
Next.

458
00:39:34,567 --> 00:39:39,436
OK. So, how it works is
I ask you a question and you comment.

459
00:39:41,567 --> 00:39:44,559
You weren't supposed to leave Canada.

460
00:39:45,367 --> 00:39:50,202
Yeah, I know that. I do. But an emergency
situation arose and I needed to...

461
00:39:50,767 --> 00:39:54,157
- What are you writing down?
- Why didn't you request permission

462
00:39:54,247 --> 00:39:56,442
to leave for your emergency?

463
00:39:56,527 --> 00:39:58,802
Well, I should have. I realise that now.

464
00:39:58,887 --> 00:40:02,800
But an emergency, by definition,
really doesn't give you the time.

465
00:40:02,887 --> 00:40:08,757
You see... the thing is, sir, I wanna be
a Canadian more than anything.

466
00:40:08,847 --> 00:40:10,838
I wanna be just like you.

467
00:40:10,927 --> 00:40:14,078
It's home, so please believe me,
I just wanna go home.

468
00:40:15,847 --> 00:40:17,838
What's that?

469
00:40:20,247 --> 00:40:22,078
OK.

470
00:40:24,247 --> 00:40:29,037
Have you...
ever been convicted of a felony?

471
00:40:33,167 --> 00:40:34,156
No.

472
00:40:38,287 --> 00:40:39,879
Yes.

473
00:40:40,207 --> 00:40:44,883
OK. OK, I was at Ronny Templeton's
house and somebody handed me a cig...

474
00:40:44,967 --> 00:40:47,879
OK, I knew it wasn't a cigarette.
It was peer pressure.

475
00:40:47,967 --> 00:40:50,242
Peer pressure is terrible in college.

476
00:40:50,327 --> 00:40:52,522
Sure, I understand. See, the thing is,

477
00:40:52,607 --> 00:40:56,805
we just received this letter from
a Sergeant Patton at the US embassy.

478
00:40:56,887 --> 00:41:01,085
It says here that you were once convicted
for possession of a narcotic.

479
00:41:04,007 --> 00:41:06,282
Is marijuana really a narcotic?

480
00:41:06,367 --> 00:41:09,916
I mean, it was just the one time,
and I didn't even enjoy it.

481
00:41:10,007 --> 00:41:14,239
I inhaled, but then I was coughing
and I was hacking away for ten minutes.

482
00:41:14,327 --> 00:41:17,922
- I hate that.
- You do?

483
00:41:18,967 --> 00:41:22,403
Look, the point is that you didn't
include this information

484
00:41:22,487 --> 00:41:26,446
in your application for citizenship.
Paragraph five, article one.

485
00:41:28,207 --> 00:41:30,357
OK.

486
00:41:31,727 --> 00:41:36,517
This is where I tell you that your request
for a new residence visa has been denied.

487
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:33,485
Yeah. He proposed to her.
He's such an asshole.

488
00:42:33,567 --> 00:42:35,956
I can't believe you won't be
my sister any more.

489
00:42:36,047 --> 00:42:39,357
- Do I have to be friends with Juliette?
- Lilly.

490
00:42:39,447 --> 00:42:42,962
Lilly, now stop it. All right?
He's not gonna marry her.

491
00:42:43,047 --> 00:42:45,038
Now, tell me everything you know.

492
00:42:45,127 --> 00:42:47,846
They're going to the South of France,
to her parents'.

493
00:42:47,927 --> 00:42:50,600
Then they're getting married
and coming to Toronto.

494
00:42:50,687 --> 00:42:53,121
We're not even invited. Not that I'd go...

495
00:42:53,207 --> 00:42:57,837
Lilly, now listen, OK?
This is very important. Very important.

496
00:42:57,927 --> 00:43:02,717
You have to tell me exactly
where they're going and when. All right?

497
00:43:02,807 --> 00:43:07,642
Now, just ask Mom, all right?
She has it all written down probably.

498
00:43:07,727 --> 00:43:10,685
OK. Are you still supposed
to be calling her Mom?

499
00:43:10,767 --> 00:43:12,997
- Lilly. Go ask Mom.
- OK.

500
00:43:13,087 --> 00:43:14,076
Mom.

501
00:43:16,367 --> 00:43:21,566
Kate? Is that you, sweetheart?
I've got all the information written down.

502
00:43:21,647 --> 00:43:24,719
I think you can still get him
at the hotel in Paris.

503
00:43:26,807 --> 00:43:28,843
Oh, my God. She's crying.

504
00:43:28,927 --> 00:43:31,043
It's OK. I'm not crying.

505
00:43:31,127 --> 00:43:33,357
I'm just...

506
00:43:33,447 --> 00:43:35,438
I'm just...

507
00:43:36,327 --> 00:43:38,636
I'm gonna get him back, Mom.

508
00:43:38,727 --> 00:43:41,878
I'm gonna get him back
and I'm gonna make him love me

509
00:43:41,967 --> 00:43:45,323
and we are gonna live happily ever after.

510
00:43:45,407 --> 00:43:47,841
And I'm just crying now in...

511
00:43:49,087 --> 00:43:51,282
happiness.

512
00:43:51,367 --> 00:43:53,722
Because I know...

513
00:43:53,807 --> 00:43:55,798
I know I will...

514
00:43:57,167 --> 00:43:59,158
I will triumph.

515
00:44:05,487 --> 00:44:07,921
- What do they call the beaches?
- La Cote d'Azur.

516
00:44:08,007 --> 00:44:10,043
- What does that mean?
- The blue coast.

517
00:44:10,127 --> 00:44:12,960
The blue coast, lying there next to you...

518
00:44:14,367 --> 00:44:18,918
- And we're gonna land in Nice.
- Nice? That's nice.

519
00:44:45,287 --> 00:44:48,279
Bob, you know how it works.

520
00:44:48,367 --> 00:44:53,646
If the little fish is to survive, he must tell
the fisherman where the big fish are.

521
00:44:53,727 --> 00:44:56,002
Forget it. I'm no rat.

522
00:44:58,207 --> 00:45:03,679
You're mixing your metaphors.
Who buys the passports?

523
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:14,486
- Hi, there. C'est moi.
- Welcome back, madam, to the George V.

524
00:45:16,487 --> 00:45:20,036
It's incredible how you do that.
The words come out, "welcome back",

525
00:45:20,127 --> 00:45:25,326
but the meaning is completely different.
Is it a French thing or a concierge thing?

526
00:45:25,407 --> 00:45:27,523
As madam wishes.

527
00:45:27,607 --> 00:45:29,802
You did it again.

528
00:45:29,887 --> 00:45:32,321
Tell me something, because I don't get it.

529
00:45:32,407 --> 00:45:34,523
Do you enjoy being that rude?

530
00:45:34,607 --> 00:45:38,202
Because when you do that,
it just gets underneath my skin

531
00:45:38,287 --> 00:45:42,678
and it makes me... completely insane.

532
00:45:48,287 --> 00:45:52,121
Thank you, madam, for the fascinating
lesson in our cultural differences.

533
00:45:52,207 --> 00:45:54,596
It would not betray
my duty now to inform you

534
00:45:54,687 --> 00:45:58,202
that your fiance and his friend
are no longer our guests.

535
00:46:00,367 --> 00:46:02,961
Well, whose guests would they be now?

536
00:46:05,367 --> 00:46:09,326
The Carlton Hotel will have that privilege.
They arrive in Cannes tomorrow.

537
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:12,285
Perhaps madam wishes
to catch the last train tonight?

538
00:46:12,367 --> 00:46:16,155
- I could arrange for a taxi very quickly.
- Yes, thank you.

539
00:46:31,527 --> 00:46:33,995
Bob, I'm losing my patience.

540
00:46:39,567 --> 00:46:42,081
A big fish just returned
from the United States.

541
00:46:43,887 --> 00:46:46,003
Luc Teyssier. Your friend, right?

542
00:46:48,847 --> 00:46:50,997
Ask him about a stolen necklace.

543
00:46:51,087 --> 00:46:54,602
He won't be hard to find. Take a look.

544
00:46:57,007 --> 00:46:58,281
You're welcome.

545
00:47:40,247 --> 00:47:42,807
I come to make peace with your people.

546
00:47:45,127 --> 00:47:47,687
So you're still after Charlie?
It is incredible.

547
00:47:47,767 --> 00:47:51,203
I admire your persistence.
It's so American.

548
00:47:51,287 --> 00:47:55,075
I am not an American.
I am a soon-to-be ex-American Canadian.

549
00:47:55,847 --> 00:47:57,644
May I help you with your bag?

550
00:47:57,727 --> 00:47:59,001
No. Maybe not.

551
00:47:59,087 --> 00:48:02,875
You know, I am feeling
some very strange emotions for me.

552
00:48:02,967 --> 00:48:06,198
Guilt. Remorse.
My self-esteem is rock bottom.

553
00:48:06,287 --> 00:48:08,847
I'm trying to think,
what can I do to say I'm sorry?

554
00:48:08,927 --> 00:48:10,121
Shut up.

555
00:48:10,207 --> 00:48:13,882
You haven't spent 60 seconds with me
when you weren't after something.

556
00:48:13,967 --> 00:48:16,322
- Buy, sell or trade?
- It is so true.

557
00:48:16,407 --> 00:48:20,798
I used you, a lot. You helped me to get
my vine and I left you with nothing.

558
00:48:20,887 --> 00:48:24,277
So now I ask myself, what can I
possibly do to make it up to you?

559
00:48:24,367 --> 00:48:26,562
And so now I am here for you.

560
00:48:30,047 --> 00:48:31,241
Typical.

561
00:50:16,007 --> 00:50:18,919
So I ask myself what I can possibly do
to make it up to you,

562
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:21,760
so I buy this ticket, et voila, here I am...

563
00:50:24,047 --> 00:50:25,036
Quiet.

564
00:50:42,527 --> 00:50:45,166
You promise one thing,
you do something else.

565
00:50:45,247 --> 00:50:47,442
So why should I believe
anything you say?

566
00:50:47,527 --> 00:50:50,837
Because I have no reason to lie now.
Do I look like the kind...

567
00:50:50,927 --> 00:50:54,363
You look like the kind who steals
liquor bottles from airplanes.

568
00:50:54,447 --> 00:50:58,599
The kind who offers a girl a ride, then has
to steal a car in order to give it to her.

569
00:50:58,687 --> 00:51:02,316
- Who puts a plant in a person's bag...
- OK, I get the picture.

570
00:51:02,407 --> 00:51:05,126
Hey. This is a no-smoking compartment.

571
00:51:05,207 --> 00:51:09,166
OK, I stop. Voila! For you.
See, I'm changing. I'm growing.

572
00:51:09,247 --> 00:51:11,442
- We help each other.
- I don't need your help.

573
00:51:12,367 --> 00:51:15,803
Do you have a plan
for when you see Charlie?

574
00:51:15,887 --> 00:51:20,722
Still no? You are going into a battle
with no strategy, no armour, no bullshit?

575
00:51:20,807 --> 00:51:25,517
- I don't need bullshit to get Charlie back.
- Just a little. It might be handy.

576
00:51:25,607 --> 00:51:30,681
For me, bullshit is like breathing.
I stay. I help you. I promise, OK?

577
00:51:30,767 --> 00:51:33,406
Do what you want.
It's a free country. Isn't it?

578
00:51:42,967 --> 00:51:44,923
Is that Charlie?

579
00:51:45,007 --> 00:51:47,077
Can I...

580
00:51:52,527 --> 00:51:54,961
- How did you meet?
- At a party.

581
00:51:55,047 --> 00:51:57,277
I'd come to Toronto
on a teaching exchange.

582
00:51:57,367 --> 00:52:00,803
We started talking and I had
this feeling about him. The same for him.

583
00:52:00,887 --> 00:52:05,165
It wasn't exactly a thunderclap
or a lightning bolt. It was more like a...

584
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:07,715
Light drizzle?

585
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:11,595
You honestly never had that feeling
about anybody in your entire life?

586
00:52:11,687 --> 00:52:16,681
If I did, I would not admit it.
His chin looks a little weak, if you ask me.

587
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:19,406
It doesn't and I didn't.
Why wouldn't you admit it?

588
00:52:19,487 --> 00:52:21,637
Why should I? Look where it has got you.

589
00:52:21,727 --> 00:52:25,640
Maybe if you did, you wouldn't have
that little problem we mustn't talk about.

590
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:31,324
It's not a problem. It's just a temporary...
There is something in his eyes.

591
00:52:31,407 --> 00:52:34,524
- Vain. It is a word, no?
- It is a word. He has beautiful eyes.

592
00:52:34,887 --> 00:52:37,640
And he knows it.
You can see it in his smile.

593
00:52:37,727 --> 00:52:40,639
Not even a smile. A smirk. It is a word?

594
00:52:40,727 --> 00:52:43,287
Shut up. Is it a word?

595
00:52:43,367 --> 00:52:47,485
Two words, no? Why are you chasing
after him after what he's done to you?

596
00:52:47,567 --> 00:52:53,164
Because I love him. And I'm afraid
that if he doesn't come back, that I'll...

597
00:52:53,247 --> 00:52:58,162
it'll hurt so much that I'll shrivel up
and never be able to love anyone again.

598
00:52:58,247 --> 00:53:03,162
You say that now but...
after a time, you would forget.

599
00:53:03,247 --> 00:53:07,081
First, you would forget his chin
and then his nose

600
00:53:07,167 --> 00:53:11,718
and after a while you would struggle
to remember the exact colour of his eyes.

601
00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:14,526
And one day you wake up and he's gone.

602
00:53:14,607 --> 00:53:18,236
His voice, his smell, his face.

603
00:53:18,327 --> 00:53:21,922
He will have left you.
And then you can begin again.

604
00:54:39,087 --> 00:54:41,078
Charlie?

605
00:56:03,847 --> 00:56:08,318
I can't seem to get enough of this cheese,
and I haven't eaten this stuff in years.

606
00:56:08,607 --> 00:56:11,644
You don't look like you got much sleep.

607
00:56:12,847 --> 00:56:16,044
For some reason,
I just feel incredibly refreshed.

608
00:56:16,127 --> 00:56:19,085
I had this dream
which I can't remember really well.

609
00:56:19,167 --> 00:56:21,920
You know when you have a dream
that is delicious

610
00:56:22,007 --> 00:56:25,443
and you wake up
and you feel all kind of transformed?

611
00:56:26,687 --> 00:56:28,917
God, it's beautiful here.

612
00:56:33,287 --> 00:56:36,996
Did you know there are 442 official
government cheeses in this country?

613
00:56:37,087 --> 00:56:39,078
Don't you think that's incredible?

614
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:44,161
To come up with 442 ways of classifying
what is basically a bacterial process?

615
00:56:44,247 --> 00:56:48,399
You prefer one cheese, one cheeseburger
and one restaurant to eat it in?

616
00:56:48,487 --> 00:56:50,955
I'm saying I like the cheese.

617
00:56:52,487 --> 00:56:56,082
God! What side of the train
did you wake up on?

618
00:56:57,887 --> 00:57:00,242
God, it's beautiful here.

619
00:57:02,567 --> 00:57:05,445
What's that face?
You don't think it's beautiful here?

620
00:57:05,527 --> 00:57:07,518
You don't think this is beautiful?

621
00:57:10,527 --> 00:57:13,917
- What?
- I was born here.

622
00:57:15,847 --> 00:57:17,838
Really?

623
00:57:18,607 --> 00:57:21,280
But this is so beautiful and so charming.

624
00:57:21,767 --> 00:57:25,043
It was too beautiful for me. I had to leave.

625
00:57:34,167 --> 00:57:36,158
Oh, God.

626
00:57:37,807 --> 00:57:39,320
What?

627
00:57:39,407 --> 00:57:42,240
- I'm gonna die.
- What? What, the cheese?

628
00:57:42,327 --> 00:57:45,842
Don't say it. Stop that rocking.

629
00:57:45,927 --> 00:57:49,044
- Stop the rocking.
- I can't stop it. It is the train.

630
00:57:50,007 --> 00:57:53,363
It's here. The mucus is here.

631
00:57:53,447 --> 00:57:58,237
- The mucus?
- The mucus coating the intestinal wall.

632
00:57:58,847 --> 00:58:00,838
Spasm! Spasm!

633
00:58:01,327 --> 00:58:04,637
No. Look at the scenery.
How beautiful. The cows...

634
00:58:04,927 --> 00:58:07,157
- Please, not the cows.
- Not the cows?

635
00:58:07,247 --> 00:58:09,238
No, I just ate that cow.

636
00:58:09,927 --> 00:58:13,078
Here it is. Here we go.

637
00:58:13,567 --> 00:58:16,798
Lactose intolerance!

638
00:58:26,167 --> 00:58:28,283
Jacques Taranne?

639
00:58:30,247 --> 00:58:32,317
I know you.

640
00:58:32,407 --> 00:58:35,763
Phillipe Cazal?

641
00:58:37,607 --> 00:58:39,245
Michel Desbordes?

642
00:58:39,327 --> 00:58:41,602
Listen, gramps, you don't know me.

643
00:58:41,687 --> 00:58:43,678
Leave me alone, OK?

644
00:58:50,607 --> 00:58:52,916
You are feeling better now?

645
00:58:53,007 --> 00:58:55,441
- Better.
- The cow is all gone?

646
00:58:55,527 --> 00:58:57,916
- When's the next train?
- Not for two more hours.

647
00:58:58,007 --> 00:58:59,998
Good.

648
00:59:02,007 --> 00:59:04,885
- I think I need to walk.
- No. Bad idea.

649
00:59:04,967 --> 00:59:07,356
You sit. We wait for the train. You rest.

650
00:59:07,447 --> 00:59:09,438
Gotta walk.

651
00:59:15,727 --> 00:59:18,161
Luc Teyssier! That's it!

652
00:59:25,607 --> 00:59:29,441
My stomach is so sensitive.
That's where I put all my stress.

653
00:59:30,807 --> 00:59:34,117
Beautiful. Gorgeous. Wish you were here.

654
00:59:35,447 --> 00:59:38,644
- How long since you've been back?
- About six years.

655
00:59:38,727 --> 00:59:44,085
- Six years? Is your family a nightmare?
- I don't really want to talk about it, OK?

656
00:59:44,167 --> 00:59:47,318
A healthy person is someone
who expresses their feelings.

657
00:59:47,407 --> 00:59:49,398
Express, not repress.

658
00:59:49,487 --> 00:59:53,765
In that case, you must be
one of the healthiest people in the world.

659
00:59:54,567 --> 00:59:57,877
You know what happens to people
who shut everybody out?

660
00:59:57,967 --> 01:00:03,087
- They lead quiet, peaceful lives?
- No. They fester.

661
01:00:03,167 --> 01:00:05,362
Fester? I am festering?

662
01:00:05,447 --> 01:00:08,245
Inside. Fester and rot.

663
01:00:08,327 --> 01:00:12,957
I've seen it happen. You'll become one
of those hunchbacked, lonely old men

664
01:00:13,047 --> 01:00:17,404
sitting in the corner of a crowded cafe,
mumbling to yourself.

665
01:00:17,487 --> 01:00:21,639
My ass is twitching.
You people make my ass twitch.

666
01:00:29,967 --> 01:00:31,844
Excuse me.

667
01:00:50,647 --> 01:00:52,638
Wait.

668
01:00:53,007 --> 01:00:56,556
- Who is that?
- It's my brother.

669
01:00:56,647 --> 01:01:00,003
- Your brother?
- My brother Antoine. Antoine, this is Kate.

670
01:01:00,887 --> 01:01:03,959
What's happening? What's happening?

671
01:01:05,367 --> 01:01:07,562
All of this vineyard is Antoine's.

672
01:01:07,647 --> 01:01:13,040
It has been in our family for three
generations. It is who we are, what we do.

673
01:01:13,127 --> 01:01:16,039
But for Antoine, I don't know...
He is always sober.

674
01:01:16,127 --> 01:01:19,517
- That's a bad thing?
- He makes the wine but never drinks it.

675
01:01:19,607 --> 01:01:22,440
You always drink it. Now...

676
01:01:23,327 --> 01:01:25,363
Why isn't part of this yours?

677
01:01:28,127 --> 01:01:33,076
My father, when he retired,
he left it to Antoine and me.

678
01:01:33,167 --> 01:01:35,283
But now it is all Antoine's.

679
01:01:36,287 --> 01:01:38,278
I don't get it.

680
01:01:39,607 --> 01:01:43,395
You see, to make a great wine,
you must have the soul of a gambler.

681
01:01:43,487 --> 01:01:46,445
You like to drink, and you like to gamble.

682
01:01:46,527 --> 01:01:48,677
Sometimes I would lose a lot.

683
01:01:48,767 --> 01:01:51,839
Sometimes I would lose to Antoine...
My dog, my first car.

684
01:01:51,927 --> 01:01:55,078
- This vineyard.
- This vineyard.

685
01:01:56,527 --> 01:02:00,076
It was one night. He got me very drunk.

686
01:02:00,167 --> 01:02:02,601
You must understand,
I owed him a lot of money.

687
01:02:02,687 --> 01:02:05,520
- But he knew what he was doing.
- What was he doing?

688
01:02:07,047 --> 01:02:09,607
I lost all of it. One hand of poker.

689
01:02:12,527 --> 01:02:15,405
You lost your birthright
in one hand of poker?

690
01:02:15,487 --> 01:02:18,160
I'm an asshole. What can I tell you?

691
01:02:21,327 --> 01:02:24,683
So that's why he hates you
and you hate him.

692
01:02:26,327 --> 01:02:28,204
That, and I...

693
01:02:28,287 --> 01:02:30,278
slept with his wife.

694
01:02:33,767 --> 01:02:36,486
What about your parents
and the rest of your family?

695
01:02:37,367 --> 01:02:41,360
No. There is nothing between us.
It is all over. Finished.

696
01:02:41,447 --> 01:02:44,678
- What if you tried again?
- No. It's not possible.

697
01:02:44,767 --> 01:02:47,759
They hate me. They despise me. They...

698
01:03:16,887 --> 01:03:18,878
Yes, thank you. All right.

699
01:03:19,887 --> 01:03:22,276
I'm very impressed.

700
01:03:23,807 --> 01:03:26,640
She's a friend, just a friend.

701
01:03:28,647 --> 01:03:31,525
Since when are women just your friends?

702
01:03:31,607 --> 01:03:33,598
Since I met her.

703
01:04:18,127 --> 01:04:19,719
I'm finished.

704
01:04:36,807 --> 01:04:39,446
Fester, fester, fester.

705
01:04:39,527 --> 01:04:41,882
Rot, rot, rot.

706
01:04:43,767 --> 01:04:47,157
Poor you. You had to grow up here.

707
01:04:48,247 --> 01:04:50,442
Show me your room.

708
01:05:01,167 --> 01:05:02,839
What's this?

709
01:05:03,567 --> 01:05:07,162
It is a project I did
a long time ago in school.

710
01:05:07,247 --> 01:05:09,602
What is it?

711
01:05:09,687 --> 01:05:11,678
All right, I will tell you but...

712
01:05:12,847 --> 01:05:15,441
First you must take some wine.

713
01:05:19,847 --> 01:05:23,601
Can you describe it, the taste?

714
01:05:24,207 --> 01:05:27,085
It's a nice red wine.

715
01:05:27,167 --> 01:05:29,920
I think you can do better.

716
01:05:30,007 --> 01:05:35,127
A bold wine with a hint of sophistication
and lacking in pretension.

717
01:05:36,927 --> 01:05:39,805
Actually, I was just talking about myself.

718
01:05:41,127 --> 01:05:43,595
- I don't know.
- No, you are not wrong.

719
01:05:43,847 --> 01:05:49,240
Wine is like people. The vine takes
all the influences in life all around it.

720
01:05:49,327 --> 01:05:54,082
It absorbs them and it gets its personality.

721
01:05:54,167 --> 01:05:56,044
Here.

722
01:05:57,607 --> 01:05:59,677
Smell.

723
01:05:59,767 --> 01:06:01,758
Rosemary.

724
01:06:06,887 --> 01:06:08,923
Some kind of mushroom?

725
01:06:09,007 --> 01:06:10,759
Very good.

726
01:06:11,287 --> 01:06:14,677
Currant, cassis, mint,

727
01:06:14,767 --> 01:06:16,439
lavender...

728
01:06:16,527 --> 01:06:21,476
They're all in the ground here,
and in the air. Now... taste the wine again.

729
01:06:25,967 --> 01:06:28,083
Close your eyes.

730
01:06:34,927 --> 01:06:38,203
The currant.
I can taste that right away and...

731
01:06:38,287 --> 01:06:40,926
from the brown bottle... lavender?

732
01:06:43,287 --> 01:06:45,403
Incredible.

733
01:06:45,487 --> 01:06:48,479
And you made this box?

734
01:06:50,447 --> 01:06:52,597
Incredible.

735
01:06:59,367 --> 01:07:01,358
Thanks.

736
01:07:32,007 --> 01:07:33,998
Whose house is that?

737
01:07:35,447 --> 01:07:38,837
It's abandoned.
No one comes here any more.

738
01:07:38,927 --> 01:07:42,317
The guy who had this place,
he gave up a long time ago.

739
01:07:43,167 --> 01:07:44,964
Look.

740
01:07:47,847 --> 01:07:51,396
You see this earth? It has been resting.

741
01:07:51,887 --> 01:07:53,878
Now it's good.

742
01:07:54,607 --> 01:07:59,397
Someday I'm going to buy this land
and I'm going to make a great wine,

743
01:07:59,487 --> 01:08:02,126
right here on this wreck of a vineyard.

744
01:08:05,807 --> 01:08:08,526
So you'd risk everything for this?

745
01:08:08,607 --> 01:08:10,598
Do anything to have it?

746
01:08:11,087 --> 01:08:13,237
Get down on your knees and beg?

747
01:08:17,247 --> 01:08:20,478
What makes you so different from me?

748
01:08:21,087 --> 01:08:23,999
Admit it. Not much.

749
01:08:25,847 --> 01:08:27,838
OK, I admit.

750
01:08:36,407 --> 01:08:38,523
It's beautiful here.

751
01:08:46,447 --> 01:08:50,360
I will help you get your Charlie back.
If you want him back, we'll get him back.

752
01:08:50,447 --> 01:08:52,438
Like I promised.

753
01:09:15,367 --> 01:09:20,680
How do you plan to buy that vineyard?
You must have some plan, some strategy.

754
01:09:21,527 --> 01:09:27,124
- I had a plan, but it did not work out.
- It didn't work out? What was the plan?

755
01:09:27,207 --> 01:09:31,166
I had... something to sell.

756
01:09:31,247 --> 01:09:33,442
Something? Like what?

757
01:09:33,527 --> 01:09:38,840
- Stocks, bonds, a little bag of plutonium?
- It doesn't matter. I lost it.

758
01:09:38,927 --> 01:09:43,523
You lost it? If it was me,
I'd have some kind of backup plan,

759
01:09:43,607 --> 01:09:46,804
something more than
just bullshit to fall back on.

760
01:09:46,887 --> 01:09:50,721
Something, perhaps,
maybe a little bit... like this.

761
01:09:56,647 --> 01:09:59,605
Luc... are you coming?

762
01:10:08,247 --> 01:10:09,839
Lesson number one.

763
01:10:09,927 --> 01:10:14,205
Before going into a war, you must
choose carefully the field of battle.

764
01:10:14,567 --> 01:10:18,082
Also, never let Charlie see
how much you desire him.

765
01:10:18,167 --> 01:10:20,840
Never tell someone that you want them.

766
01:10:20,927 --> 01:10:25,284
You see that? What's that pout?
Juliette did that. I remember it pertectly.

767
01:10:25,367 --> 01:10:28,359
The pout is one of the French
women's greatest weapons.

768
01:10:28,447 --> 01:10:31,280
- What's so great about that?
- It is provocative.

769
01:10:31,367 --> 01:10:34,757
It puts the man in a constant state
of excitement and anxiety.

770
01:10:35,087 --> 01:10:38,875
She knows how to say "yes" when she
means "no", "no" for "yes". Understand?

771
01:10:38,967 --> 01:10:40,958
- No.
- You don't?

772
01:10:41,687 --> 01:10:43,006
Gotcha.

773
01:10:43,647 --> 01:10:46,844
Now, most important.
When Charlie sees you,

774
01:10:46,927 --> 01:10:50,442
he will be expecting a big scene, a drama.

775
01:10:50,527 --> 01:10:55,647
You will not give him the satisfaction.
This will make him immediately intrigued.

776
01:10:55,727 --> 01:10:58,161
Luc. Look. Look what I found.

777
01:10:58,247 --> 01:11:00,317
It made me think of you.

778
01:11:13,047 --> 01:11:15,686
Monsieur Antoine Teyssier.

779
01:11:15,767 --> 01:11:18,361
How will you be paying, sir?

780
01:11:35,007 --> 01:11:37,726
When would you like
to have the wedding?

781
01:11:37,807 --> 01:11:40,924
- Next weekend.
- Next weekend?

782
01:12:22,007 --> 01:12:25,602
- Is there something wrong, Charlie?
- No. I...

783
01:12:25,687 --> 01:12:28,155
I swear I just saw Kate.

784
01:12:28,247 --> 01:12:30,636
I'm sure it's just your imagination.

785
01:12:40,447 --> 01:12:42,517
Tell me. What does your father do?

786
01:12:42,607 --> 01:12:46,680
Well, he's a doctor... like me.
Except he's a psychiatrist.

787
01:12:56,087 --> 01:12:59,318
- I'll be right back.
- Please, Charlie, sit down.

788
01:13:31,527 --> 01:13:34,121
- My parents are watching.
- I'm sure I just saw Kate.

789
01:13:36,327 --> 01:13:38,238
Come with me now.

790
01:13:45,247 --> 01:13:47,966
You really don't understand
a word I tell you.

791
01:13:48,047 --> 01:13:52,484
How can I help you win back this
ridiculous man if you act like a clown?

792
01:13:52,567 --> 01:13:56,799
It was an accident, OK? I wasn't
expecting to see him right then.

793
01:13:56,887 --> 01:14:00,721
Sucking up to her parents... in that outfit.

794
01:14:01,687 --> 01:14:07,159
And did you see her? Cutting her food
into tiny little chewable pieces like that.

795
01:14:07,687 --> 01:14:09,405
I saw her. She was...

796
01:14:11,007 --> 01:14:13,396
- She was what?
- She was...

797
01:14:14,287 --> 01:14:17,040
OK. I know what you're saying.
I'm not sexy enough.

798
01:14:17,127 --> 01:14:20,915
- No, I did not say anything.
- I'm supposed to be this pouty girl

799
01:14:21,007 --> 01:14:25,285
who says "yes" when she means "no"
and "no" for "yes" and I cannot do it, OK?

800
01:14:25,367 --> 01:14:27,835
Happy-smile. Sad-frown.

801
01:14:27,927 --> 01:14:31,044
Use the corresponding face
for the corresponding emotion.

802
01:14:31,127 --> 01:14:35,405
But you? No, you want
a mysterious, sexy, manipulative...

803
01:14:35,487 --> 01:14:38,126
- It is not me who wants it.
- What do you want?

804
01:14:38,207 --> 01:14:42,883
- I want you... I want you...
- You want me...?

805
01:14:45,767 --> 01:14:47,758
I want you to...

806
01:14:49,047 --> 01:14:51,561
make Charlie suffer.

807
01:14:52,607 --> 01:14:54,598
To be tempted.

808
01:14:55,607 --> 01:14:57,643
I want you to make him

809
01:14:57,727 --> 01:15:02,562
feel like, even though
you are right there in front of him,

810
01:15:02,647 --> 01:15:04,638
he can't have you.

811
01:15:07,367 --> 01:15:09,358
That's all.

812
01:16:38,647 --> 01:16:41,036
Luc?

813
01:16:46,807 --> 01:16:48,718
Do you...

814
01:16:52,447 --> 01:16:56,838
Do you think I still have a chance
with Charlie after what happened earlier?

815
01:16:57,927 --> 01:16:59,918
Yes, of course.

816
01:17:00,567 --> 01:17:04,765
And tomorrow we will turn
your mistake to our advantage.

817
01:17:05,167 --> 01:17:06,885
We will?

818
01:17:06,967 --> 01:17:10,277
He will still be wondering,
did he see you?

819
01:17:10,367 --> 01:17:13,723
You will be like a ghost, a phantom.

820
01:17:13,807 --> 01:17:16,799
And it will infect them, their rapport.

821
01:17:17,687 --> 01:17:19,917
Well, when do I confront him?

822
01:17:20,007 --> 01:17:23,795
Just when they are starting
to look comfortable again.

823
01:17:25,367 --> 01:17:27,278
Then you attack.

824
01:17:27,367 --> 01:17:29,881
- Kate!
- Hi! Hi.

825
01:17:32,327 --> 01:17:36,161
- Can I sit with you guys?
- But of course. Please have a seat.

826
01:17:40,767 --> 01:17:43,281
Pardonnez-moi. Pay no attention to me.

827
01:17:43,367 --> 01:17:47,599
- So... you must be Juliette.
- Yes, I am Juliette.

828
01:17:47,687 --> 01:17:51,680
Let me take a good look at the woman
who stole my Charlie's little heart.

829
01:17:51,767 --> 01:17:55,077
I did not steal anything
that didn't want to be stolen.

830
01:17:57,447 --> 01:18:01,565
She's smart, Charlie. And beautiful,
and probably great at everything.

831
01:18:01,647 --> 01:18:05,322
- Look, Kate...
- Relax. I didn't come here for a fight.

832
01:18:05,407 --> 01:18:07,284
Hello, waiter.

833
01:18:07,727 --> 01:18:11,436
I don't speak much French,
so bear with me. I'd like a sea breeze.

834
01:18:13,167 --> 01:18:16,239
French waiters.
If you're nice, they treat you like shit.

835
01:18:16,327 --> 01:18:18,682
Treat them like shit, they love you.

836
01:18:25,647 --> 01:18:28,844
- What?
- Nothing. You just seem so different.

837
01:18:28,927 --> 01:18:34,285
Well... Charlie, I'm going through
some sort of transitional thing.

838
01:18:34,687 --> 01:18:38,885
See, after you called, I decided to get on
a plane to Paris and get you back.

839
01:18:38,967 --> 01:18:42,277
- I hate to fly. In fact, I never fly, right?
- Yes.

840
01:18:42,367 --> 01:18:46,804
But there was no way everything I'd been
building toward would be destroyed

841
01:18:46,887 --> 01:18:50,846
because some pouty little-this is
before I knew you personally-bitch,

842
01:18:50,927 --> 01:18:54,283
wanted to steal a husband.
I bought the ticket, got on the plane

843
01:18:54,367 --> 01:18:59,680
and somehow made it over the ocean.
Then an extraordinary thing happened.

844
01:18:59,767 --> 01:19:01,678
What?

845
01:19:01,767 --> 01:19:03,758
Everything went wrong.

846
01:19:04,527 --> 01:19:10,045
So I was wandering the streets of Paris,
penniless, without a hope in the world.

847
01:19:10,127 --> 01:19:13,836
And, let me tell you, you can do a lot
of soul-searching in a time like that.

848
01:19:13,927 --> 01:19:16,805
I realised that I've spent
most of my adult life

849
01:19:16,887 --> 01:19:20,197
trying to protect myself
from exactly this situation.

850
01:19:20,287 --> 01:19:25,998
And you can't do it. There's no home safe
enough, no relationship secure enough.

851
01:19:26,087 --> 01:19:28,806
You're setting yourself up
for an even bigger fall

852
01:19:28,887 --> 01:19:33,165
and having an incredibly boring time
in the process. Sorry, Charlie.

853
01:19:34,007 --> 01:19:35,998
Thank you.

854
01:19:38,167 --> 01:19:40,283
And that's when I took up with Luc.

855
01:19:40,367 --> 01:19:42,039
Luke?

856
01:19:42,127 --> 01:19:44,038
Luc.

857
01:19:46,007 --> 01:19:50,603
Here he is. Luc. Come on over.
I want you to meet some great people.

858
01:19:54,207 --> 01:19:56,846
Luc, the lovely Juliette.

859
01:19:58,647 --> 01:20:00,638
Charlie, Luc.

860
01:20:03,007 --> 01:20:05,043
Sweetie pie?

861
01:20:12,967 --> 01:20:15,765
- What did he just say?
- I don't know.

862
01:20:15,847 --> 01:20:19,078
He doesn't speak much English,
but we seem to manage just fine.

863
01:20:19,167 --> 01:20:20,964
- You do?
- Yeah.

864
01:20:21,047 --> 01:20:24,676
I think it's that transitional thing,
you know, to help me get over us.

865
01:20:24,767 --> 01:20:27,486
That's probably what it is but...
what the hell?

866
01:20:27,567 --> 01:20:30,081
I love the sea, so beautiful...

867
01:20:30,167 --> 01:20:32,158
so mysterious...

868
01:20:32,247 --> 01:20:35,159
so... full of fish.

869
01:20:37,847 --> 01:20:39,838
What does he do?

870
01:20:39,927 --> 01:20:42,361
Besides what we do together?

871
01:20:42,447 --> 01:20:45,041
I don't think he does anything at all.

872
01:20:53,167 --> 01:20:55,806
That was so great.

873
01:20:56,687 --> 01:21:01,283
Hi, there. You were fantastic. Incredible.
They were completely destroyed.

874
01:21:01,367 --> 01:21:05,155
That was amazing. I just feel released.

875
01:21:05,247 --> 01:21:08,956
Now, tonight,
you will have dinner with Charlie,

876
01:21:09,047 --> 01:21:12,835
pretending to work out the details
of the breakup.

877
01:21:12,927 --> 01:21:16,283
By tomorrow, I promise you,
you will be queen of the castle again.

878
01:21:16,367 --> 01:21:18,801
We must celebrate.
Some wine, champagne.

879
01:21:19,687 --> 01:21:21,678
- Don't move.
- OK.

880
01:21:31,407 --> 01:21:34,843
A beautiful day to be in Cannes.
Isn't it, Kate?

881
01:21:36,607 --> 01:21:38,404
I'm sorry. Do we know each other?

882
01:21:38,487 --> 01:21:42,480
No. But we have a mutual acquaintance.
Luc Teyssier.

883
01:21:43,807 --> 01:21:47,482
That's why I come talk to you
about a... necklace.

884
01:21:53,327 --> 01:21:57,366
The necklace.
He was silly and he didn't declare it.

885
01:21:57,447 --> 01:22:00,803
Will it be a large penalty
that he'll have to pay?

886
01:22:07,607 --> 01:22:10,167
So why don't you just arrest him?

887
01:22:10,247 --> 01:22:14,843
I'm old-fashioned. I owe him a large debt,
much bigger than the debt of money.

888
01:22:14,927 --> 01:22:19,239
So I ask you to talk to him. It can be
returned to me tomorrow... anonymously.

889
01:22:20,327 --> 01:22:22,887
- He'll never agree.
- He must.

890
01:22:24,527 --> 01:22:27,280
Call me tomorrow.

891
01:22:27,367 --> 01:22:31,519
It really is a beautiful day.
I hope you're able to enjoy it.

892
01:22:42,007 --> 01:22:45,204
This is where I will sell
my necklace tomorrow.

893
01:22:45,287 --> 01:22:47,755
- Your necklace.
- My necklace.

894
01:22:47,847 --> 01:22:49,963
It was my grandmother's necklace.

895
01:22:50,047 --> 01:22:53,881
She lived in San Francisco.
When she died, she left it to me.

896
01:22:53,967 --> 01:22:56,037
OK, sure. Why not?

897
01:22:56,767 --> 01:22:58,405
Luc?

898
01:22:58,487 --> 01:23:01,843
- What if I sell the necklace?
- You? What do you mean? Why?

899
01:23:01,927 --> 01:23:06,239
Why? Because I am me, and you are you.

900
01:23:06,327 --> 01:23:10,843
- I mean, if I go into Cartier...
- All dressed up, looking just so.

901
01:23:10,927 --> 01:23:13,919
Smiling your little smile,
walking your little walk.

902
01:23:14,007 --> 01:23:15,918
That would be better. Thank you.

903
01:23:16,207 --> 01:23:20,166
- What do you mean, my little walk?
- Just the way you walk, you know?

904
01:23:20,247 --> 01:23:24,877
- Like a woman, but also like a little girl.
- No, it's not.

905
01:23:32,047 --> 01:23:34,686
You want something to drink?

906
01:23:34,767 --> 01:23:36,962
OK. Great. I'll be out in a second.

907
01:23:53,487 --> 01:23:56,285
I bought it at the store downstairs.

908
01:23:57,127 --> 01:24:00,676
You look wondertul. Was it expensive?

909
01:24:00,767 --> 01:24:03,327
- Yeah.
- You charged it to the room?

910
01:24:03,847 --> 01:24:06,077
Good. No problem.

911
01:24:06,167 --> 01:24:08,965
I only wish my brother could see you.

912
01:24:09,047 --> 01:24:11,083
It only needs one thing.

913
01:24:11,927 --> 01:24:15,886
- You will wear this tonight.
- I don't think that's such a good idea.

914
01:24:16,607 --> 01:24:18,996
I insist. It will be your charm...

915
01:24:19,087 --> 01:24:21,078
Your good luck charm.

916
01:24:31,367 --> 01:24:33,961
Who is the goddess now?

917
01:24:34,647 --> 01:24:36,877
Now! We practise.

918
01:24:36,967 --> 01:24:38,958
I will be Charlie.

919
01:24:41,847 --> 01:24:43,838
I'll be Kate.

920
01:24:46,087 --> 01:24:48,840
So we are dancing.
I realise how much I need you.

921
01:24:48,927 --> 01:24:52,602
I am thinking, I am an idiot,
a fool, a chinless, mindless...

922
01:24:52,687 --> 01:24:54,678
OK. OK, I get the idea.

923
01:24:56,087 --> 01:24:58,078
We are dancing.

924
01:24:58,167 --> 01:25:01,079
It feels... so right.

925
01:25:01,167 --> 01:25:03,158
Now, what do you say to me?

926
01:25:05,367 --> 01:25:07,562
I don't know any more.

927
01:25:07,647 --> 01:25:09,683
You don't?

928
01:25:09,767 --> 01:25:14,397
I don't know when to stop pretending.
I mean, when do I tell him that...

929
01:25:15,727 --> 01:25:20,278
That you love only him
and still you want him.

930
01:25:21,087 --> 01:25:23,157
You will know the moment.

931
01:25:24,407 --> 01:25:27,001
You will tell him, and that will be that.

932
01:25:28,367 --> 01:25:31,837
You know what I am going to do for you
to ensure victory?

933
01:25:31,927 --> 01:25:33,838
What's that?

934
01:25:33,927 --> 01:25:35,918
Juliette.

935
01:25:37,767 --> 01:25:39,166
Juliette?

936
01:25:39,247 --> 01:25:43,320
She will be feeling a little sad tonight,
a little angry.

937
01:25:43,407 --> 01:25:45,682
A little vulnerable.

938
01:25:45,767 --> 01:25:48,725
I will find her and I will... comfort her.

939
01:25:50,807 --> 01:25:54,117
I wouldn't want you to do
anything too unpleasant.

940
01:25:55,287 --> 01:25:57,801
- I do it for you.
- Well, what about your little...?

941
01:25:57,887 --> 01:26:00,924
My little problem
will not be such a problem tonight.

942
01:26:01,007 --> 01:26:04,443
Suddenly, I'm feeling like you-relaxed.

943
01:26:05,247 --> 01:26:08,603
I will go to her.
I will find her and talk to her...

944
01:26:13,167 --> 01:26:15,237
Let's just dance.

945
01:26:31,527 --> 01:26:35,520
I keep the bonsai.
The lamp we got in New York is yours.

946
01:26:35,607 --> 01:26:39,156
The love seat in the living room...
Tell me if you think this is crazy.

947
01:26:39,247 --> 01:26:42,717
We get a chain saw, right down
the middle and make two chairs.

948
01:26:42,807 --> 01:26:46,083
Can we not talk about this?
It's so depressing, isn't it?

949
01:26:46,167 --> 01:26:49,716
It's business, Charlie.
This is the business of breaking up.

950
01:26:49,807 --> 01:26:53,516
If you can't handle it, I could have
a yard sale and send you half the cash.

951
01:26:53,607 --> 01:26:56,883
- You must hate me.
- I don't. The CDs will be tough, though.

952
01:26:56,967 --> 01:27:00,323
- Why don't you just let me have them?
- You don't hate me?

953
01:27:00,407 --> 01:27:03,843
No. I did, Charlie. I really did, but...

954
01:27:03,927 --> 01:27:05,679
Now...

955
01:27:07,087 --> 01:27:08,884
No.

956
01:27:10,327 --> 01:27:12,761
Kate.

957
01:27:12,847 --> 01:27:14,360
I...

958
01:27:16,967 --> 01:27:19,800
- Sweetie, are you crying?
- No.

959
01:27:19,887 --> 01:27:21,878
No, no. I...

960
01:27:22,207 --> 01:27:24,880
You know, I just feel so totally,
horribly guilty.

961
01:27:24,967 --> 01:27:28,437
Listen, don't feel guilty
because I'll start feeling guilty

962
01:27:28,527 --> 01:27:31,087
that I made you feel guilty and...

963
01:27:32,807 --> 01:27:34,638
You know...

964
01:27:34,727 --> 01:27:36,957
Actually, that was the old me.

965
01:27:37,047 --> 01:27:40,278
Just feel guilty. Swim in it
till your fingers get all pruny.

966
01:27:42,967 --> 01:27:47,040
You're amazing. You really are.

967
01:27:57,167 --> 01:27:59,158
Kate.

968
01:28:00,367 --> 01:28:03,359
Will you dance with me? Just...

969
01:28:04,247 --> 01:28:06,886
One last dance?

970
01:28:08,567 --> 01:28:10,046
Please?

971
01:28:22,967 --> 01:28:27,358
You're right about his chin.
Sometimes I want to hit it.

972
01:28:28,567 --> 01:28:32,560
- He's a waste of your time.
- No, he's wondertul.

973
01:28:32,647 --> 01:28:34,922
So tender.

974
01:28:35,007 --> 01:28:36,998
Not like a French man.

975
01:28:38,407 --> 01:28:42,241
- You know what I mean?
- Yes, I understand.

976
01:28:42,327 --> 01:28:44,887
How could he do this to me?

977
01:28:45,407 --> 01:28:49,480
When I was younger,
this wouldn't have happened.

978
01:28:50,007 --> 01:28:53,602
He would be with me in my room
and she would wait all night.

979
01:28:54,087 --> 01:28:55,884
I can imagine.

980
01:28:55,967 --> 01:28:58,117
Look at me, please.

981
01:28:58,207 --> 01:29:00,198
Tell me what you see.

982
01:29:10,767 --> 01:29:14,396
You seem so different... but the same.

983
01:29:16,847 --> 01:29:20,237
And it's like somebody
turned a light on inside you.

984
01:29:22,567 --> 01:29:24,558
Why wasn't it me?

985
01:30:27,647 --> 01:30:32,323
- Is something wrong?
- No, in fact, everything is fine.

986
01:30:33,607 --> 01:30:36,917
Please forgive me. Please forgive me.

987
01:30:37,007 --> 01:30:38,998
I must have been insane.

988
01:30:43,887 --> 01:30:45,878
Luc...

989
01:30:47,047 --> 01:30:49,038
Kate...

990
01:30:51,647 --> 01:30:54,036
What did you just say?

991
01:30:55,727 --> 01:30:57,718
I said Kate.

992
01:31:08,767 --> 01:31:10,280
- Oh, Kate.
- Stop.

993
01:31:10,367 --> 01:31:12,278
Darling.

994
01:31:12,367 --> 01:31:15,086
Charlie, I said... stop.

995
01:31:16,167 --> 01:31:17,998
What?

996
01:31:18,087 --> 01:31:20,237
- Charlie...
- What?

997
01:31:20,327 --> 01:31:25,003
Why wasn't it you who turned on the big
Kate light that burns so bright now

998
01:31:25,087 --> 01:31:29,000
that you can't resist dumping
your new girlfriend for your old one?

999
01:31:29,087 --> 01:31:31,078
What?

1000
01:31:31,167 --> 01:31:34,045
12 hours ago, all you wanted was Juliette.

1001
01:31:35,007 --> 01:31:38,079
Juliette? I... She's wondertul.

1002
01:31:38,167 --> 01:31:40,886
Exciting. And...

1003
01:31:41,407 --> 01:31:44,558
When I met her, I wasn't thinking.

1004
01:31:44,647 --> 01:31:47,764
Sometimes you just do things.
You don't think about them.

1005
01:31:47,847 --> 01:31:50,486
You just need to do them,
do what you're feeling.

1006
01:31:51,647 --> 01:31:55,560
Maybe I was just... I was afraid.
Afraid of where we were headed.

1007
01:31:55,647 --> 01:31:58,559
You know?
I was afraid of getting married.

1008
01:31:58,967 --> 01:32:01,162
Charlie?

1009
01:32:01,247 --> 01:32:04,284
You weren't afraid of
getting married to her.

1010
01:32:17,807 --> 01:32:20,924
You know, no matter what
I might seem like tonight,

1011
01:32:21,007 --> 01:32:25,523
it's still the same old me from yesterday
you'd wind up with tomorrow.

1012
01:32:25,607 --> 01:32:28,838
The same old me
who wants the home and the family,

1013
01:32:28,927 --> 01:32:33,159
who wants to plant some roots
and see them grow.

1014
01:32:35,727 --> 01:32:38,480
Do you want to be a farmer?

1015
01:32:39,847 --> 01:32:41,838
Sorry.

1016
01:32:51,527 --> 01:32:54,724
There's just one thing
I don't want any more.

1017
01:32:57,767 --> 01:32:59,758
I'm sorry, Charlie.

1018
01:33:07,407 --> 01:33:09,125
Yeah, it's open.

1019
01:33:12,687 --> 01:33:14,917
Good morning.

1020
01:33:16,007 --> 01:33:18,396
Morning.

1021
01:33:20,607 --> 01:33:23,075
So how did it go? What happened?

1022
01:33:24,927 --> 01:33:26,918
Well, he wants to come back.

1023
01:33:30,487 --> 01:33:32,284
Congratulations.

1024
01:33:35,807 --> 01:33:38,446
What about you?
The old bull back in business?

1025
01:33:45,567 --> 01:33:48,604
We better get going. Cartier is waiting.

1026
01:34:20,647 --> 01:34:23,923
Everything as you said. The egg?

1027
01:34:24,647 --> 01:34:26,558
Nest egg.

1028
01:34:26,647 --> 01:34:28,922
It was wired from your bank in Toronto,

1029
01:34:29,007 --> 01:34:32,716
and Cartier has agreed
to issue the cheque in exchange.

1030
01:34:32,807 --> 01:34:35,196
The illusion is complete.

1031
01:34:38,447 --> 01:34:40,438
Thank you.

1032
01:34:41,487 --> 01:34:44,684
Why are you doing this?
You're not with Luc.

1033
01:34:45,007 --> 01:34:47,919
You will probably never see him again.

1034
01:34:49,687 --> 01:34:51,837
I don't know.

1035
01:34:54,367 --> 01:34:58,804
I must come to Canada some day.
You are very sympathetic people.

1036
01:35:00,447 --> 01:35:02,881
Well, I'm not really a Canadian.

1037
01:35:02,967 --> 01:35:06,642
In fact, I'm... currently without country.

1038
01:35:10,687 --> 01:35:12,837
Just out of curiosity,

1039
01:35:13,727 --> 01:35:15,718
what is it worth?

1040
01:35:16,847 --> 01:35:20,396
I would say... over $100,000.

1041
01:35:27,207 --> 01:35:29,596
44,782.

1042
01:35:31,167 --> 01:35:33,761
This is not possible.

1043
01:35:35,647 --> 01:35:39,037
Why did I listen to you
and your little walk and...

1044
01:35:39,127 --> 01:35:41,197
- He said there was a flaw.
- A flaw?

1045
01:35:41,287 --> 01:35:43,357
- Some flaws.
- Some flaws?

1046
01:35:43,447 --> 01:35:49,044
He said they were beautiful diamonds
but, officially, there are flaws. Sorry.

1047
01:35:49,967 --> 01:35:51,958
- It's OK.
- It's OK?

1048
01:35:53,247 --> 01:35:56,125
It is not as much as I was hoping,

1049
01:35:56,207 --> 01:36:01,361
but it is enough to buy the land
and to start the planting.

1050
01:36:01,967 --> 01:36:06,802
It will take longer, maybe six years,
before we have a decent bottle but...

1051
01:36:07,847 --> 01:36:09,678
Thank you.

1052
01:36:09,767 --> 01:36:12,804
Thank you very much.
You're my angel of luck.

1053
01:36:13,687 --> 01:36:15,757
Who would have thought it?

1054
01:36:28,247 --> 01:36:30,920
I have to go... cos Charlie's waiting.

1055
01:37:04,167 --> 01:37:06,203
You know I love you!

1056
01:37:10,207 --> 01:37:13,517
Listen, I had dinner with her...

1057
01:37:15,767 --> 01:37:17,917
Why don't you go back to her?

1058
01:37:18,007 --> 01:37:19,998
You went up to the room like a...

1059
01:37:22,087 --> 01:37:24,123
Juliette!

1060
01:37:36,967 --> 01:37:39,959
Ah, love. It's wondertul.

1061
01:37:41,447 --> 01:37:43,165
What are you doing here?

1062
01:37:43,247 --> 01:37:46,364
Some guy paid his hotel bill
with a stolen credit card.

1063
01:37:46,447 --> 01:37:48,438
I've taken care of it.

1064
01:37:52,887 --> 01:37:55,003
That's not true love.

1065
01:37:55,847 --> 01:37:57,838
What do you know?

1066
01:37:57,927 --> 01:38:02,045
Would you like to hear a true love story?
I know a good one.

1067
01:38:04,607 --> 01:38:08,600
- Really? Does it have a happy ending?
- I don't know.

1068
01:38:08,687 --> 01:38:11,281
Maybe you can help with the ending.

1069
01:38:11,927 --> 01:38:14,600
- Me?
- Yes.

1070
01:38:14,687 --> 01:38:17,838
Imagine... an airplane.

1071
01:38:37,367 --> 01:38:39,358
Kate?

1072
01:38:42,087 --> 01:38:43,202
Yes?

1073
01:38:43,287 --> 01:38:46,677
You are not afraid to fly any more?

1074
01:38:46,767 --> 01:38:49,884
You are thinking of
your little stone cottage?

1075
01:38:51,047 --> 01:38:54,437
It's on a hillside
next to a beautiful vineyard.

1076
01:38:55,527 --> 01:39:00,123
- But that's not what I'm thinking about.
- What are you thinking about?

1077
01:39:02,087 --> 01:39:03,566
You.

1078
01:39:10,367 --> 01:39:14,155
And I am thinking...
you should not be flying anywhere.

1079
01:39:15,727 --> 01:39:19,003
- I shouldn't?
- In fact, I am sure of it.

1080
01:39:20,087 --> 01:39:22,999
- You are?
- I am thinking...

1081
01:39:23,087 --> 01:39:25,521
I want you...

1082
01:39:27,887 --> 01:39:30,685
You want me...?

1083
01:39:30,767 --> 01:39:34,760
That's all. I want you.

1084
01:41:26,487 --> 01:41:28,637
- Sing that song.
- What song?

1085
01:41:28,727 --> 01:41:30,718
The Bobby Darin song.

1086
01:41:30,807 --> 01:41:33,321
- It's not Bobby Darin.
- Yeah, the Bobby Darin song.

1087
01:41:33,407 --> 01:41:37,241
- It's Charles Trenet.
- No. Somewhere beyond...

1088
01:41:37,327 --> 01:41:39,682
No. "La Mer". It is "La Mer".

1089
01:41:39,767 --> 01:41:44,045
- Maybe your guy covered it for Bobby.
- No. It is a French song.

1090
01:41:44,127 --> 01:41:46,118
Luc, could you just sing the song?

1091
01:46:08,167 --> 01:46:10,886
