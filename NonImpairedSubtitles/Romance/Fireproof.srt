1
00:00:45,143 --> 00:00:47,990
All right, sweet pea,
it's time for you to go to bed.

2
00:00:48,151 --> 00:00:51,349
Mommy, would you ask Daddy
to come tuck me in?

3
00:00:51,512 --> 00:00:53,748
No, he's at work tonight
at the fire station.

4
00:00:53,912 --> 00:00:55,848
But he'll be home
tomorrow night.

5
00:00:56,024 --> 00:00:58,643
Mommy, I want to marry Daddy.

6
00:00:58,808 --> 00:01:01,744
You do?
Catherine, you can't marry Daddy.

7
00:01:01,913 --> 00:01:03,342
He's my husband.

8
00:01:03,514 --> 00:01:05,848
Well, when you're done being married,
can I have him?

9
00:01:07,162 --> 00:01:10,511
We'll never be done.
You'll have to marry somebody else.

10
00:01:10,681 --> 00:01:13,235
Can I wear a white dress
and white gloves?

11
00:01:13,402 --> 00:01:15,027
Sure, if you want to.

12
00:01:15,194 --> 00:01:18,708
Will we live happily after ever?

13
00:01:19,194 --> 00:01:22,293
If you marry somebody
who really, really loves you.

14
00:01:22,459 --> 00:01:24,020
Like Daddy?

15
00:01:24,188 --> 00:01:26,675
Yes, like Daddy.

16
00:02:27,937 --> 00:02:30,304
- Terrell, man, my bad out there.
- This ain't no game.

17
00:02:30,466 --> 00:02:32,254
You playing with people lives.

18
00:02:32,897 --> 00:02:34,010
Come on, man.

19
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:38,426
Eric, he's got a right to be upset.

20
00:02:38,594 --> 00:02:41,115
You left him in a dangerous spot
and tried to be a hero.

21
00:02:41,283 --> 00:02:43,170
I thought I heard someone
calling for help.

22
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,981
It was coming
from outside the building.

23
00:02:46,147 --> 00:02:47,423
It was dark, I couldn't see.

24
00:02:47,586 --> 00:02:50,718
That's why you stay with your partner.
He had to assume...

25
00:02:50,883 --> 00:02:54,080
...that something happened to you
and you needed his help.

26
00:02:54,659 --> 00:02:57,857
You never leave your partner,
especially in a fire.

27
00:02:59,907 --> 00:03:02,275
You give him some time
and then give him an apology.

28
00:03:02,436 --> 00:03:04,956
- And make it sincere.
- Yes, sir.

29
00:03:14,309 --> 00:03:16,251
- Hey, Tasha.
- Oh, hey, Cat.

30
00:03:16,422 --> 00:03:18,048
Just saw you on TV. Looking good.

31
00:03:18,214 --> 00:03:20,864
Oh, I missed it. I was giving a tour
of the new cancer wing.

32
00:03:21,029 --> 00:03:22,917
- Hey, has Robin left yet?
- No, she's here.

33
00:03:23,078 --> 00:03:24,606
Robin, Cat's here.

34
00:03:24,774 --> 00:03:26,050
- Hey.
- How are you?

35
00:03:26,214 --> 00:03:27,327
I'm good. How are you?

36
00:03:27,494 --> 00:03:29,251
Good.
Hey, are we still on for tomorrow?

37
00:03:29,415 --> 00:03:32,000
Yeah, 4:00. You still want
those scented candles, right?

38
00:03:32,167 --> 00:03:33,509
Oh, absolutely. Bring them on.

39
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:34,915
- I wanna try them all.
- Good.

40
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:36,867
I'm going to see my parents
this weekend.

41
00:03:37,031 --> 00:03:39,749
- I thought they might like some too.
- Oh, how are they?

42
00:03:39,912 --> 00:03:42,727
Do you know it's been a year
since Mom's stroke?

43
00:03:42,888 --> 00:03:45,310
I've been trying to get her
a new bed and wheelchair...

44
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,065
...but their insurance
doesn't cover it.

45
00:03:48,232 --> 00:03:50,469
I don't know.
It's so frustrating for my dad.

46
00:03:50,633 --> 00:03:53,317
He wants to help her too,
but he can't afford it either.

47
00:03:53,481 --> 00:03:55,456
- I am so sorry.
- Yeah, it's all right.

48
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:57,285
Anyway, well, I need to run.

49
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:59,621
- But I'll see you tomorrow, right?
- I'll see you.

50
00:03:59,785 --> 00:04:01,542
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

51
00:04:02,026 --> 00:04:04,447
- Hey, Catherine.
- I'm so sorry, Dr. Keller.

52
00:04:04,618 --> 00:04:06,244
Call me Gavin, please.

53
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:08,799
Gavin, sorry for almost
running you over.

54
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:11,819
- Anytime. It's good to see you.
- You too. Take care.

55
00:04:15,211 --> 00:04:16,771
Sweet girl.

56
00:04:17,323 --> 00:04:20,706
- Tasha, will you file this for me?
- Sure, doctor.

57
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:28,327
If I didn't know any better,
I'd say the doctor has a thing for Cat.

58
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:41,863
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hey, Daddy.

59
00:04:42,029 --> 00:04:44,233
- How are you?
- Oh, great. Good to see you.

60
00:04:44,398 --> 00:04:45,544
You too.

61
00:04:45,711 --> 00:04:49,605
Hey, Mama. How are you, huh?

62
00:04:49,774 --> 00:04:51,433
She's doing great today.

63
00:04:51,599 --> 00:04:53,289
Can I get you
something to drink, dear?

64
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,558
- Do you have any sweet tea?
- With lemon?

65
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,475
You know me.

66
00:05:01,743 --> 00:05:04,394
Oh, Mama, I wish we could talk.

67
00:05:05,616 --> 00:05:08,583
It's been so long
since I heard your voice.

68
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:13,900
I miss you.

69
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:41,870
- You have breakfast already?
- Yes.

70
00:05:43,091 --> 00:05:46,539
- What'd you eat?
- I had the last bagel and a yoghurt.

71
00:05:53,716 --> 00:05:55,954
Are you planning
on making a grocery trip soon?

72
00:05:56,341 --> 00:05:58,642
Caleb, you work 24 hours
and then you're off for 48.

73
00:05:58,805 --> 00:06:01,740
- You've got more time to go than I do.
- I asked a simple question.

74
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:04,976
You don't need to get smart with me.
At least save me some breakfast.

75
00:06:05,142 --> 00:06:07,990
I never know when you're coming
or going. You don't tell me.

76
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:09,775
Catherine, what is your problem?

77
00:06:09,942 --> 00:06:11,950
Did I offend you
by walking in the door?

78
00:06:12,119 --> 00:06:15,152
You can't expect me to work every day
and get the groceries...

79
00:06:15,318 --> 00:06:18,734
...while you look at trash on the
Internet dreaming about your boat.

80
00:06:18,903 --> 00:06:20,495
You chose to take this job.

81
00:06:20,662 --> 00:06:23,314
- No one said you had to work full-time.
- We need the income.

82
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,935
Especially since you tuck away
a third of your salary...

83
00:06:26,103 --> 00:06:27,664
...saving for a boat we don't need.

84
00:06:27,832 --> 00:06:31,542
You've got $24,000 in savings
when things in our house need fixing.

85
00:06:31,704 --> 00:06:33,111
Like what?

86
00:06:33,272 --> 00:06:36,022
The back door needs to be painted,
the yard needs landscaping.

87
00:06:36,184 --> 00:06:38,289
And I wanna put more shelves
in the closet.

88
00:06:38,456 --> 00:06:41,042
Those are called preferences.
Those are not needs.

89
00:06:41,209 --> 00:06:44,439
There's a difference. If you wanna
spend your money on that stuff, fine.

90
00:06:44,602 --> 00:06:47,733
I've been saving for my boat for years.
You're not taking that from me.

91
00:06:47,897 --> 00:06:50,101
This is so pointless.
I don't have time for this.

92
00:06:50,266 --> 00:06:52,437
Yeah, shut the door
on your way out.

93
00:07:25,725 --> 00:07:27,580
It ain't working, Michael.

94
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:30,549
How is it that I get respect
everywhere I go...

95
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:32,506
...except in my own house?

96
00:07:33,118 --> 00:07:36,085
I've been there,
and it's a hard place to be.

97
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:39,098
What'd you do about it?

98
00:07:40,063 --> 00:07:42,429
I realized that it wasn't my marriage
that was broken.

99
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:44,598
I just didn't know
how to make it work.

100
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,351
What does that mean?

101
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,814
That treadmill's not broken.

102
00:07:50,976 --> 00:07:53,943
But if you don't know how to run it,
it ain't gonna work for you.

103
00:07:55,136 --> 00:07:56,730
You saying I need counselling?

104
00:07:56,895 --> 00:07:58,751
Well, I think everybody
needs counselling.

105
00:07:59,264 --> 00:08:02,679
Hey, look, man, I am not about to go
talk to somebody I don't even know...

106
00:08:02,848 --> 00:08:05,020
...about something
that's none of their business.

107
00:08:05,185 --> 00:08:08,054
All right.
Catherine does need to respect you.

108
00:08:08,225 --> 00:08:10,014
But just remember,
a woman's like a rose.

109
00:08:10,177 --> 00:08:12,796
If you treat her right, she'll bloom.

110
00:08:12,962 --> 00:08:14,969
If you don't, she'll wilt.

111
00:08:17,218 --> 00:08:18,429
Where'd you get that?

112
00:08:19,105 --> 00:08:20,512
Counselling.

113
00:08:38,308 --> 00:08:39,966
Great.

114
00:08:40,132 --> 00:08:41,790
What are you doing?

115
00:08:42,308 --> 00:08:44,348
I see you left me no pizza.

116
00:08:44,517 --> 00:08:46,688
I just lit that candle.
I like the way it smells.

117
00:08:46,852 --> 00:08:49,373
Well, I don't.
Did you leave me any dinner at all?

118
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:51,613
I assumed
you were eating with Michael.

119
00:08:51,973 --> 00:08:53,183
Does it not occur to you...

120
00:08:53,349 --> 00:08:55,521
...that two people in this house
both need to eat?

121
00:08:55,686 --> 00:08:57,890
You know what?
If you would communicate with me...

122
00:08:58,054 --> 00:09:00,193
...maybe I could
have something for you.

123
00:09:01,191 --> 00:09:03,612
Why do you have to make
everything so difficult?

124
00:09:03,782 --> 00:09:05,440
Oh, I'm making everything difficult?

125
00:09:05,606 --> 00:09:08,902
I'm carrying the weight around here
while you're off doing your own thing.

126
00:09:09,063 --> 00:09:10,110
Excuse me?

127
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:13,475
I'm working to pay this mortgage,
and I pay for both of the cars.

128
00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:16,574
Yeah, and that's all you do.
I pay all of our bills with my salary.

129
00:09:16,744 --> 00:09:18,653
Which you agreed to do. That's fair.

130
00:09:18,824 --> 00:09:21,159
Do you not like this house?
Do you not like your car?

131
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,076
Caleb, who takes care
of this house?

132
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,833
Me. Who washes all the clothes?

133
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,407
Me. Who gets all the groceries?

134
00:09:26,568 --> 00:09:29,699
Me. Not to mention I'm helping
my parents every weekend.

135
00:09:29,864 --> 00:09:31,326
I've got all this pressure on me.

136
00:09:31,497 --> 00:09:33,669
The only thing you do for anybody
is for yourself.

137
00:09:33,834 --> 00:09:36,801
Let me tell you, you don't know
the first thing about pressure.

138
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:40,286
All right? You think
I put out house fires for myself?

139
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:43,208
Or rush to car wrecks at 2 a.m.
for myself?

140
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:46,753
Or pull a child's body
out of a lake for myself?

141
00:09:46,922 --> 00:09:49,160
You have no idea what I go through.

142
00:09:49,323 --> 00:09:51,908
Yeah, but what do you do around here
other than watch TV...

143
00:09:52,075 --> 00:09:53,602
...and waste time on the Internet?

144
00:09:53,771 --> 00:09:56,553
If looking at that trash
is how you get fulfilled, that's fine.

145
00:09:56,715 --> 00:09:58,122
But I will not compete with it.

146
00:09:58,283 --> 00:10:00,423
Well, I sure don't get it from you.

147
00:10:01,452 --> 00:10:02,499
And you won't.

148
00:10:02,667 --> 00:10:05,254
Because you care more
about saving for your stupid boat...

149
00:10:05,421 --> 00:10:08,323
...and pleasing yourself
than you ever did about me.

150
00:10:08,492 --> 00:10:11,460
Shut up! I'm sick of you!

151
00:10:11,629 --> 00:10:14,826
You disrespectful, ungrateful,
selfish woman!

152
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:16,778
- I'm not selfish.
- How dare you say that?

153
00:10:16,942 --> 00:10:20,422
You constantly nag me
and you drain the life out of me!

154
00:10:20,589 --> 00:10:22,444
I'm tired of it!

155
00:10:22,606 --> 00:10:24,515
If you can't give me
the respect I deserve...

156
00:10:24,685 --> 00:10:25,962
Look at me!

157
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:28,494
- then what's the point
of this marriage?

158
00:10:35,663 --> 00:10:37,386
I want out.

159
00:10:38,031 --> 00:10:39,973
I just want out.

160
00:10:40,815 --> 00:10:44,329
If you want out, that's fine with me!

161
00:11:18,579 --> 00:11:20,008
Mr. Rudolph.

162
00:11:21,299 --> 00:11:22,282
Caleb.

163
00:12:04,055 --> 00:12:05,943
- That's it.
- All right.

164
00:12:06,104 --> 00:12:07,696
Think we got it. We're good to go.

165
00:12:07,863 --> 00:12:09,107
I think I got this.

166
00:12:09,272 --> 00:12:11,444
- You think you know the truck?
- Yeah.

167
00:12:11,608 --> 00:12:13,680
All right. I'll tell you what.

168
00:12:13,848 --> 00:12:16,238
We're gonna go inside
and get something to drink.

169
00:12:16,408 --> 00:12:18,350
You bring me a hose stretcher.

170
00:12:18,521 --> 00:12:19,895
All right.

171
00:12:20,921 --> 00:12:24,237
- That's mean, man.
- No, it's good for him.

172
00:12:24,409 --> 00:12:25,653
- Mother's gifts.
- Okay.

173
00:12:25,817 --> 00:12:27,727
- And...
- You know what? I forgot to tell you.

174
00:12:27,898 --> 00:12:29,937
- I got Friday off and I'll be there.
- Good.

175
00:12:30,105 --> 00:12:31,796
You know I ain't gonna
let my son down.

176
00:12:31,962 --> 00:12:32,945
I know you won't.

177
00:12:33,115 --> 00:12:35,219
Hey, we still got
that hot date tomorrow, right?

178
00:12:35,386 --> 00:12:36,881
Oh, so now it's a hot date?

179
00:12:37,051 --> 00:12:38,807
Life's too short
to have any other kind.

180
00:12:38,971 --> 00:12:40,399
You're right.

181
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:43,418
- I love you, baby.
- I love you too.

182
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:45,619
- And I will see you in the morning.
- All right.

183
00:12:45,787 --> 00:12:48,438
- Back home.
- All right, see you later.

184
00:12:52,444 --> 00:12:54,746
Eric, what are you doing?

185
00:12:56,828 --> 00:12:58,519
Wayne told me
to grab a hose stretcher.

186
00:12:58,685 --> 00:13:00,986
- A hose stretcher?
- Yes, sir.

187
00:13:01,565 --> 00:13:04,762
Eric, you are the hose stretcher.

188
00:13:08,061 --> 00:13:09,556
Man.

189
00:13:13,598 --> 00:13:15,486
Honey, I agree with you.
You gotta get out.

190
00:13:15,646 --> 00:13:17,686
- He don't deserve you.
- You can say that again.

191
00:13:17,853 --> 00:13:21,913
A real man's gotta be a hero to his wife
before anybody, or he ain't a real man.

192
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:25,494
Do you need a place to stay? I can't
imagine living in the same house.

193
00:13:25,663 --> 00:13:27,868
No, I decided
that I'm not the one that's leaving.

194
00:13:28,031 --> 00:13:31,031
- He's the problem, not me.
- That's right, girl. Stand your ground.

195
00:13:31,199 --> 00:13:32,410
Make him respect you.

196
00:13:32,576 --> 00:13:34,714
If there's one thing
a man understands...

197
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:38,175
It's respect. That's the issue. That's
the reason our marriage is failing.

198
00:13:38,336 --> 00:13:42,133
She shows me no respect at all.
And the saddest part about it is...

199
00:13:42,304 --> 00:13:44,159
He doesn't have a clue.

200
00:13:44,321 --> 00:13:47,071
He thinks our marriage
has been fine for the most part.

201
00:13:47,233 --> 00:13:48,640
You know, he probably thinks...

202
00:13:48,801 --> 00:13:50,710
Our marriage has been fine
until this year.

203
00:13:50,881 --> 00:13:53,303
Now, all of a sudden,
she goes off the deep end.

204
00:13:53,698 --> 00:13:55,585
Do you think this happened
all of a sudden?

205
00:13:55,745 --> 00:13:57,982
I don't know what to think.
I don't understand her.

206
00:13:58,146 --> 00:13:59,805
She's emotional about everything.

207
00:13:59,971 --> 00:14:02,207
She's easily offended
and way too sensitive.

208
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:05,720
I mean, he's so insensitive,
you know?

209
00:14:05,891 --> 00:14:09,274
He doesn't truly care how I feel.
He doesn't listen to me.

210
00:14:09,443 --> 00:14:12,509
Even if I say it over
and over and over again.

211
00:14:12,675 --> 00:14:15,643
And then she starts nagging me
and saying I don't listen to her...

212
00:14:15,812 --> 00:14:17,534
...or something like that.

213
00:14:17,699 --> 00:14:20,122
It drives me crazy.
I feel like I'm going...

214
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:21,754
Insane.

215
00:14:21,924 --> 00:14:24,313
You know,
he doesn't understand my needs.

216
00:14:24,485 --> 00:14:27,071
I feel like we are
completely and totally...

217
00:14:27,237 --> 00:14:28,218
Incompatible.

218
00:14:28,388 --> 00:14:31,520
She's probably whining to her friends,
making me sound like a criminal.

219
00:14:31,685 --> 00:14:34,881
I can see them all right now, crying,
having some sort of group hug.

220
00:14:35,046 --> 00:14:37,380
It's gonna be okay, sweetie.
It's gonna be all right.

221
00:14:37,542 --> 00:14:38,970
You'll get through this.

222
00:14:39,142 --> 00:14:40,157
We have your back.

223
00:14:40,326 --> 00:14:42,213
Whatever you need.
Whatever you need.

224
00:14:42,598 --> 00:14:44,703
So you think
it's past the point of no return?

225
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:48,479
I don't have a reason to return.

226
00:14:54,471 --> 00:14:56,610
- Bethany.
- Hey, Kyle. Hey, Ross.

227
00:14:56,776 --> 00:14:58,532
- What's going on?
- What are y'all doing?

228
00:14:58,696 --> 00:15:00,736
We're heading to the pizza barn
to meet friends.

229
00:15:00,903 --> 00:15:02,627
Y'all wanna come?

230
00:15:02,792 --> 00:15:04,386
Sure.

231
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:08,680
Hey, we'll race you there.
And if you win, we'll buy.

232
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:11,361
Ready, set...

233
00:15:11,529 --> 00:15:12,511
Go, go, go.

234
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:24,639
Hey, Dad.

235
00:15:27,275 --> 00:15:29,030
No, not really.

236
00:15:29,194 --> 00:15:31,616
I think Catherine and I are done.

237
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:35,105
No, it's over.

238
00:15:37,548 --> 00:15:39,719
She said she wants out.

239
00:15:43,244 --> 00:15:45,895
Sure, yeah, you can come over
tomorrow. I'll be home.

240
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,733
Dad, I gotta go.

241
00:15:50,284 --> 00:15:52,587
Public Safety
to Engine 1, Battalion 1.

242
00:15:52,749 --> 00:15:56,611
Respond to the intersection of
Roosevelt and Kelley, 10-50-I rescue.

243
00:15:56,781 --> 00:15:58,920
- Time out, 12:21.
- Hey, that's close by.

244
00:15:59,086 --> 00:16:01,988
Lieutenant, you and Terrell
take the other truck and go with us.

245
00:16:09,487 --> 00:16:11,112
Okay, let's roll.

246
00:16:25,712 --> 00:16:28,941
Engine 1 is en route
to Roosevelt and Kelley, 10-50 rescue.

247
00:16:29,104 --> 00:16:30,665
10-4, Engine 1.

248
00:16:30,832 --> 00:16:34,127
Lieutenant, you and Sanders have
the Hurst tools ready if we need them.

249
00:16:34,545 --> 00:16:37,164
- You stay with me when we pull up.
- Yes, sir.

250
00:16:38,801 --> 00:16:39,979
We've already got a crowd.

251
00:16:40,145 --> 00:16:43,015
- Can you see it?
- We've got one car on the tracks.

252
00:16:43,186 --> 00:16:44,233
You're kidding me.

253
00:16:44,689 --> 00:16:45,802
Oh, it doesn't look good.

254
00:16:46,226 --> 00:16:47,241
Engine 1, it's 10-23.

255
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:50,060
We have a two-vehicle accident
with possible entrapment.

256
00:16:50,226 --> 00:16:52,398
One of the vehicles
is on the train tracks.

257
00:16:52,562 --> 00:16:55,759
Notify the train dispatcher
to stop all trains in progress.

258
00:16:55,923 --> 00:16:58,378
Ten-four, Command.
Be advised, EMS is en route.

259
00:16:58,547 --> 00:17:00,723
- Rookie, you come with me.
- Yes, sir. Let's go, guys.

260
00:17:02,644 --> 00:17:05,066
You two go check out the car.
Let me know what you got.

261
00:17:05,235 --> 00:17:07,340
I need
an inch-and-three-quarter line.

262
00:17:07,892 --> 00:17:09,453
Harmon,
you check out the passenger.

263
00:17:09,621 --> 00:17:13,003
All right, I need you all to stay clear
of the tracks and the vehicle.

264
00:17:13,172 --> 00:17:14,995
I'm Captain Holt
from the Fire Department.

265
00:17:15,157 --> 00:17:17,578
- We're here to help.
- Help me, please. I can't get out.

266
00:17:17,749 --> 00:17:19,724
- Where are you hurting?
- My legs are hurting.

267
00:17:19,893 --> 00:17:22,991
- Please, please help me.
- All right, we're gonna help you.

268
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:26,225
Okay. Where else are you hurting?

269
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:28,943
My neck is hurting.
Please, please help.

270
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:31,477
We're gonna get you out of here.
You're gonna be fine.

271
00:17:31,638 --> 00:17:33,809
Please don't leave me.
Please don't let me die.

272
00:17:33,974 --> 00:17:36,080
I promise you
I am not going to leave you.

273
00:17:36,247 --> 00:17:37,839
- You're gonna be all right.
- Captain.

274
00:17:38,006 --> 00:17:40,309
- She's alive but not responding.
- Get the spreaders.

275
00:17:40,471 --> 00:17:42,708
Those two will be okay.
They've got minor injuries.

276
00:17:42,872 --> 00:17:45,108
We have to cut these two out.
Sanders, help Harmon.

277
00:17:45,271 --> 00:17:47,279
- I need you to check for gas leaks.
- Yes, sir.

278
00:17:47,448 --> 00:17:48,789
We've got an ambulance coming.

279
00:17:48,951 --> 00:17:50,839
- I'm gonna stay right here with you.
- Okay.

280
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,561
You're gonna hear
a very loud noise.

281
00:17:52,729 --> 00:17:55,183
That just means
we're getting you out faster.

282
00:17:55,352 --> 00:17:57,687
- All right. You're gonna be all right.
- Okay.

283
00:17:59,864 --> 00:18:02,734
- Captain, did I just hear a train?
- Guys, there's a train coming.

284
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:05,012
Dispatcher,
this is Roosevelt Command.

285
00:18:05,176 --> 00:18:06,704
We have a car on the train tracks.

286
00:18:06,873 --> 00:18:09,656
Notify the train dispatcher
to stop all trains in progress.

287
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:11,736
Roosevelt Command, be advised...

288
00:18:11,897 --> 00:18:15,062
... we are currently unable to make
contact with the train dispatcher.

289
00:18:15,226 --> 00:18:16,687
No, no, no. We don't have time.

290
00:18:16,858 --> 00:18:20,471
Come on, we're gonna have to push it
out of the way. Let's go, let's go.

291
00:18:20,635 --> 00:18:22,423
No, I don't wanna die.
I don't wanna die.

292
00:18:22,587 --> 00:18:25,305
All right, let's go. Push. Push.

293
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,605
Captain, it's not rolling.
We gotta drag it off.

294
00:18:31,772 --> 00:18:34,193
- Get the chain.
- Hey, Wayne, hook up the chain.

295
00:18:34,364 --> 00:18:36,187
Hook up the chain.

296
00:18:37,468 --> 00:18:39,672
Hey, there's a train!

297
00:18:39,836 --> 00:18:42,870
- Captain, we gotta pick this up.
- All right, grab the front.

298
00:18:43,036 --> 00:18:46,615
Lift on three. One, two, three.

299
00:18:49,533 --> 00:18:51,737
Again. One, two, three.

300
00:18:54,782 --> 00:18:57,532
Again. Let's go.
We're getting this car off the tracks.

301
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,773
One, two, three.

302
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:06,709
Again. One, two, three.

303
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,451
- Again, captain.
- One, two, three.

304
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,770
One, two, three.

305
00:19:30,498 --> 00:19:32,701
Harmon, go back
and get the spreaders.

306
00:19:36,834 --> 00:19:37,815
Medic!

307
00:19:38,818 --> 00:19:41,371
- You all right?
- Come on, let's go.

308
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:44,097
You'll be okay.
You're gonna be all right.

309
00:20:21,638 --> 00:20:23,264
Thank you, Lord.

310
00:20:25,094 --> 00:20:26,817
Thank you, God.

311
00:20:29,063 --> 00:20:30,918
Thank you, God.

312
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,622
Are you okay?

313
00:20:37,159 --> 00:20:39,047
Captain, I just needed a minute.

314
00:20:48,329 --> 00:20:53,544
Well, I broke my record of how close
I could come to death and still live.

315
00:20:54,985 --> 00:20:57,222
Well, don't break it next time.

316
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:01,188
I wasn't trying to break it this time.

317
00:21:04,522 --> 00:21:05,864
Hey.

318
00:21:06,954 --> 00:21:08,199
Don't tell my wife.

319
00:21:37,165 --> 00:21:39,532
- Hey, lieutenant?
- Yeah?

320
00:21:40,526 --> 00:21:42,981
This kind of thing doesn't happen
all the time, does it?

321
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:45,419
Risking our lives? Yes.

322
00:21:45,582 --> 00:21:48,483
Playing chicken with a train?
First time.

323
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:51,878
- Aren't you afraid of dying?
- No.

324
00:21:52,335 --> 00:21:53,741
Because I know where I'm going.

325
00:21:53,903 --> 00:21:56,587
I just don't wanna get there
because I got hit by a train.

326
00:21:59,343 --> 00:22:01,580
Why don't you come
help me work on some dinner?

327
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:03,662
All right.

328
00:22:05,872 --> 00:22:08,655
Hey, captain, hold on for a second.

329
00:22:09,264 --> 00:22:11,119
You know where you're going?

330
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:14,414
- I'm going to my office.
- No.

331
00:22:15,024 --> 00:22:17,032
You believe in heaven and hell?

332
00:22:19,857 --> 00:22:21,133
I don't know.

333
00:22:21,297 --> 00:22:24,876
When I die, I'm going in the ground.
That's where I'm staying.

334
00:22:25,042 --> 00:22:28,359
You know, you and Michael both seem
so sure, but one of you is wrong.

335
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:30,287
It ain't me.

336
00:22:30,451 --> 00:22:32,011
How do you know?

337
00:22:32,882 --> 00:22:34,987
Hey, listen,
you might not agree with Michael...

338
00:22:35,154 --> 00:22:37,543
...but you and I both know
he's the real deal.

339
00:22:42,419 --> 00:22:44,689
Son, how long has this
been going on?

340
00:22:44,852 --> 00:22:47,405
I don't know, Dad. We've had
our arguments now and then...

341
00:22:47,572 --> 00:22:50,474
...but it seems like now
she is constantly frustrated with me.

342
00:22:50,644 --> 00:22:53,230
I mean, I walk in the door
and she's mad about something.

343
00:22:53,395 --> 00:22:55,054
Have you given her
reason to be upset?

344
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:57,228
I've never known Catherine
to be unreasonable.

345
00:22:57,397 --> 00:22:59,917
I could have saved the lives
of two people at work...

346
00:23:00,085 --> 00:23:03,217
...and if I'm not here helping wash
the dishes, I'm a horrible husband.

347
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:05,421
But, Caleb,
she needs your help here as well.

348
00:23:05,589 --> 00:23:07,728
Doesn't she help her parents out
every week?

349
00:23:07,894 --> 00:23:11,309
- She can't do everything around here.
- You sound like you're taking her side.

350
00:23:11,478 --> 00:23:13,202
But she's working and she's trying...

351
00:23:13,366 --> 00:23:16,049
Mom, I do not need you to tell me
I'm doing everything wrong.

352
00:23:16,214 --> 00:23:19,063
I've got Catherine for that.
I am not the problem, she is.

353
00:23:19,223 --> 00:23:22,703
- All I'm saying is, if she's working...
- Cheryl, let's hear Caleb out.

354
00:23:22,871 --> 00:23:24,759
I wanna know
what's going on with him.

355
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:30,103
Dad, can I please have a few minutes
to talk with you, alone?

356
00:23:30,264 --> 00:23:32,598
Caleb, I just wanna help
you and Catherine.

357
00:23:32,759 --> 00:23:34,615
- Dad.
- Honey.

358
00:23:35,417 --> 00:23:38,515
Why don't you let us take a walk?
It's all right.

359
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,957
Okay.

360
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:47,577
Dad, why did you have to bring her?

361
00:23:47,737 --> 00:23:50,291
Caleb, because she's my wife.

362
00:23:50,458 --> 00:23:53,971
And your mother,
no one loves you more than her.

363
00:23:54,137 --> 00:23:56,472
She just... She's always fixing me.

364
00:23:56,635 --> 00:23:59,602
She's still trying to fix me.
I'm not broken.

365
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:04,048
Son, if you're looking
for a perfect mother...

366
00:24:04,507 --> 00:24:06,417
...I'm afraid
there's not one out there.

367
00:24:06,587 --> 00:24:08,082
But she's a good woman.

368
00:24:08,252 --> 00:24:10,161
And I love her now
more than I ever have.

369
00:24:10,331 --> 00:24:13,561
I'm not saying I don't love her, Dad.
Just that she...

370
00:24:13,724 --> 00:24:15,000
She grates on me.

371
00:24:16,028 --> 00:24:19,127
Have you not seen a change in her
in the last two years?

372
00:24:19,612 --> 00:24:21,816
Yeah, she treats you better.

373
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:24,850
But you've also put up with a lot
over the years.

374
00:24:25,341 --> 00:24:27,251
Well, so has she.

375
00:24:27,837 --> 00:24:29,430
Dad, I'm glad you didn't split up...

376
00:24:29,598 --> 00:24:31,899
...but I would have understood
if you had.

377
00:24:32,061 --> 00:24:33,971
Do you know why we didn't?

378
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:38,386
Not really. She realized
she couldn't do any better?

379
00:24:38,558 --> 00:24:39,987
Not quite.

380
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:43,388
Caleb, the Lord did a work in us.

381
00:24:43,551 --> 00:24:45,494
In both of us.

382
00:24:46,815 --> 00:24:48,473
The Lord?

383
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,865
- You're giving credit to God?
- Why does that bother you?

384
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:54,203
You've always believed in God.

385
00:24:55,488 --> 00:24:58,749
If there's a God out there, he's not
interested in me and my problems.

386
00:24:58,912 --> 00:25:02,459
I disagree.
I'd say he's very interested.

387
00:25:02,625 --> 00:25:04,031
Then where's he been in my life?

388
00:25:04,192 --> 00:25:07,040
He's been at work all around you.
You just haven't realized it.

389
00:25:07,201 --> 00:25:10,550
You haven't exactly
given him an open invitation.

390
00:25:15,618 --> 00:25:17,145
What is this place?

391
00:25:18,307 --> 00:25:20,095
Used to be a summer camp
across the lake.

392
00:25:20,258 --> 00:25:22,625
I think this must be a part of it.

393
00:25:24,291 --> 00:25:28,568
Son, I used to be
where you are right now.

394
00:25:29,603 --> 00:25:31,610
God didn't matter to me.

395
00:25:31,779 --> 00:25:33,722
But I can't say that anymore.

396
00:25:33,891 --> 00:25:36,258
I never understood why Jesus
had to die on the cross...

397
00:25:36,419 --> 00:25:37,794
Dad, please.

398
00:25:37,956 --> 00:25:40,062
We had this conversation
last month.

399
00:25:40,228 --> 00:25:43,741
I'm glad this new faith is working
for you and Mom, I really am.

400
00:25:43,908 --> 00:25:45,436
It's just...

401
00:25:45,701 --> 00:25:47,588
It's not for me.

402
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:54,435
Caleb...

403
00:25:55,398 --> 00:25:58,332
...is there anything in you
that wants to save your marriage?

404
00:25:59,366 --> 00:26:02,301
Maybe. If Catherine wanted to,
but she doesn't. She wants divorce.

405
00:26:02,694 --> 00:26:03,938
Is that what you want?

406
00:26:04,614 --> 00:26:06,556
I want peace.

407
00:26:06,726 --> 00:26:08,286
But what difference does it make?

408
00:26:08,454 --> 00:26:10,626
She signs the papers, Dad,
it's all over.

409
00:26:12,455 --> 00:26:15,106
Have you agreed
to start the process with her?

410
00:26:15,495 --> 00:26:18,147
No, but I think we both understand
where this is all headed.

411
00:26:18,312 --> 00:26:20,646
I've got plans
to meet with my lawyer tomorrow.

412
00:26:20,808 --> 00:26:23,110
Caleb, I want you
to do something for me.

413
00:26:23,272 --> 00:26:24,255
What?

414
00:26:24,744 --> 00:26:27,428
I want you to hold off on the divorce
for 40 days.

415
00:26:29,033 --> 00:26:30,014
Why?

416
00:26:30,921 --> 00:26:33,409
I'm gonna send you
something in the mail.

417
00:26:33,929 --> 00:26:35,903
Something that'll take you
that long to do.

418
00:26:37,194 --> 00:26:40,838
- What is it?
- It's what saved our marriage.

419
00:26:42,153 --> 00:26:45,220
Dad, if this is a religious thing,
I'd rather you didn't.

420
00:26:45,386 --> 00:26:48,288
Look at it as a gift from your father.

421
00:26:48,459 --> 00:26:51,394
Take one day at a time,
then see what happens.

422
00:26:52,555 --> 00:26:57,640
Please, son.
If for no other reason, do it for me.

423
00:26:57,803 --> 00:26:59,811
I'm asking as your father.

424
00:27:03,979 --> 00:27:06,795
- Forty days?
- Forty days.

425
00:27:20,557 --> 00:27:22,947
- Eating alone?
- Well, hello, Dr. Keller.

426
00:27:23,118 --> 00:27:24,547
- Gavin.
- Gavin, sorry.

427
00:27:24,717 --> 00:27:26,059
- How are you?
- I'm doing well.

428
00:27:26,222 --> 00:27:28,132
I just need a place
to put my plate down.

429
00:27:28,302 --> 00:27:29,676
Is this spot reserved?

430
00:27:29,838 --> 00:27:32,588
Deidra was supposed to meet me,
but you're welcome to join us.

431
00:27:32,751 --> 00:27:35,718
Well, if you're gonna twist my arm,
I don't want any trouble.

432
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:42,636
Are you gonna eat
wearing your clean white coat?

433
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:44,687
I need to keep up
with the latest fashions.

434
00:27:44,848 --> 00:27:47,303
It seems all the doctors
are wearing one these days.

435
00:27:47,472 --> 00:27:49,862
But it's probably not too smart
while I'm eating.

436
00:27:50,289 --> 00:27:52,110
I didn't know
doctors cared about fashion.

437
00:27:52,272 --> 00:27:54,345
We keep up
with the attractive fashions...

438
00:27:54,512 --> 00:27:56,652
...the Public Relations
employees wear.

439
00:27:56,817 --> 00:27:58,224
I see.

440
00:27:58,385 --> 00:28:00,557
Since there's
only one person in that category...

441
00:28:00,722 --> 00:28:02,129
...I'm sure she'd feel honoured.

442
00:28:02,289 --> 00:28:04,559
She should. She's pretty amazing.

443
00:28:18,387 --> 00:28:21,355
Hey, you look good.

444
00:28:23,828 --> 00:28:27,570
Thanks. I try to take care of myself.

445
00:28:27,732 --> 00:28:29,739
You like this song?

446
00:28:30,772 --> 00:28:32,715
Oh, yeah.

447
00:28:33,909 --> 00:28:35,664
You feel that?

448
00:28:36,308 --> 00:28:40,106
It's called chemistry, and we got it.

449
00:28:42,165 --> 00:28:43,823
Wayne won't leave you.

450
00:28:50,198 --> 00:28:53,613
- Hey, man, you seen my bag in here?
- No, I ain't seen it.

451
00:28:53,782 --> 00:28:55,921
All right. It's probably in my locker.

452
00:28:59,959 --> 00:29:01,781
Where were we?

453
00:29:12,729 --> 00:29:15,249
Oh, come on. That ain't funny.

454
00:29:15,416 --> 00:29:16,463
This ain't no show.

455
00:29:17,529 --> 00:29:18,772
This is me-time.

456
00:29:20,281 --> 00:29:21,393
Terrell!

457
00:29:21,913 --> 00:29:23,408
Wayne.

458
00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:29,711
Forty days? Does Catherine know?

459
00:29:30,233 --> 00:29:31,411
I'm not gonna tell her.

460
00:29:31,578 --> 00:29:34,262
If she wants to go ahead and file,
that's up to her.

461
00:29:34,713 --> 00:29:36,918
Divorce is a hard thing, man.

462
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:38,647
Well, if it brings peace...

463
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:42,127
But, Caleb,
you want the right kind of peace.

464
00:29:42,298 --> 00:29:43,411
What do you mean by that?

465
00:29:44,571 --> 00:29:46,742
You know what that ring
on your finger means?

466
00:29:46,907 --> 00:29:48,401
- Means I'm married.
- Yeah.

467
00:29:48,571 --> 00:29:50,514
It also means
you made a lifelong covenant.

468
00:29:50,684 --> 00:29:53,334
You putting on that ring
while saying your vows.

469
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,711
The sad part about it is...

470
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:57,047
...when most people promise
for better or worse...

471
00:29:57,212 --> 00:29:59,154
...they really only mean
for the better.

472
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:04,156
Catherine and I were in love
when we got married, but today...

473
00:30:04,317 --> 00:30:06,456
...we're two very different people,
all right?

474
00:30:06,621 --> 00:30:08,792
It's just not working out anymore.

475
00:30:12,062 --> 00:30:15,575
Caleb, salt and pepper
are completely different.

476
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:19,453
Their makeup is different,
their taste and their colour.

477
00:30:19,614 --> 00:30:21,437
But you always see them together.

478
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:23,572
And when you...

479
00:30:24,542 --> 00:30:25,753
Hold on just a second.

480
00:30:33,536 --> 00:30:35,029
What are you doing?

481
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:39,837
Michael. Hey.

482
00:30:40,224 --> 00:30:41,980
What'd you do that for?

483
00:30:47,617 --> 00:30:52,058
Caleb, when two people get married,
it's for better or for worse.

484
00:30:52,226 --> 00:30:54,048
For richer or for poorer.

485
00:30:54,753 --> 00:30:57,208
In sickness and in health.

486
00:30:57,378 --> 00:30:58,360
I know that.

487
00:30:58,530 --> 00:31:01,116
But marriages aren't fireproof.
Sometimes, you get burned.

488
00:31:02,914 --> 00:31:05,882
Fireproof doesn't mean
that a fire will never come...

489
00:31:06,051 --> 00:31:08,953
...but that when it comes,
you'll be able to withstand it.

490
00:31:09,763 --> 00:31:12,697
- You didn't have to glue them.
- Don't do it, Caleb.

491
00:31:12,867 --> 00:31:15,901
If you pull them apart now,
you'll break either one or both of them.

492
00:31:18,211 --> 00:31:20,700
I am not a perfect person,
but better than most.

493
00:31:20,868 --> 00:31:23,618
And if my marriage is failing,
it is not all my fault.

494
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:26,236
But, Caleb, I've seen you
run into a burning building...

495
00:31:26,405 --> 00:31:28,380
...to save people
you don't even know.

496
00:31:28,549 --> 00:31:31,681
But you're gonna let your own
marriage just burn to the ground.

497
00:31:33,862 --> 00:31:35,836
Michael, you are my friend.

498
00:31:36,005 --> 00:31:38,908
And I have allowed you
to speak freely with me on this job.

499
00:31:39,078 --> 00:31:40,092
Don't abuse it.

500
00:32:22,953 --> 00:32:26,849
My son, this 40-day journey
cannot be taken lightly.

501
00:32:27,019 --> 00:32:29,834
It is a challenging
and often difficult process...

502
00:32:29,995 --> 00:32:32,003
... but an incredibly fulfilling one.

503
00:32:32,171 --> 00:32:34,986
If you will commit
to a day at a time for 40 days...

504
00:32:35,147 --> 00:32:38,464
... the results could change your life
and your marriage.

505
00:32:38,636 --> 00:32:42,630
Consider it a dare from others
who have done it before you.

506
00:32:43,724 --> 00:32:46,953
Day one: The first part of this dare
is fairly simple.

507
00:32:47,116 --> 00:32:49,506
Although love is communicated
in a number of ways...

508
00:32:49,677 --> 00:32:52,644
... our words often reflect
the condition of our heart.

509
00:32:52,813 --> 00:32:53,795
For the next day...

510
00:32:53,965 --> 00:32:56,714
... resolve to say nothing negative
to your spouse at all.

511
00:32:56,877 --> 00:32:59,725
If the temptation arises,
choose not to say anything.

512
00:32:59,886 --> 00:33:02,919
It's better to hold your tongue
than to say something you'll regret.

513
00:33:03,086 --> 00:33:06,828
Be quick to listen,
slow to speak and slow to get angry.

514
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:09,096
James 1: 19.

515
00:33:22,927 --> 00:33:25,862
Would you have time
to take that to the dry-cleaners today?

516
00:33:26,224 --> 00:33:29,519
Think after two days off, you would
have already taken care of that.

517
00:33:43,186 --> 00:33:44,168
Day two:

518
00:33:44,337 --> 00:33:48,396
It is difficult to demonstrate love
when you feel little to no motivation.

519
00:33:48,562 --> 00:33:51,759
But love in its truest sense
is not based on feelings...

520
00:33:51,922 --> 00:33:54,476
... but a determination
to show thoughtful actions...

521
00:33:54,643 --> 00:33:56,880
... even when there seems
to be no reward.

522
00:33:57,043 --> 00:33:59,793
In addition to saying nothing negative
to your spouse today...

523
00:33:59,955 --> 00:34:05,357
... do at least one unexpected gesture
as an act of kindness.

524
00:34:29,173 --> 00:34:31,246
I poured your coffee.

525
00:34:31,414 --> 00:34:33,421
I don't have time for coffee.

526
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,142
Day three:

527
00:34:56,312 --> 00:34:59,891
Whatever you put your time,
energy and money into...

528
00:35:00,057 --> 00:35:01,813
... will become
more important to you.

529
00:35:01,977 --> 00:35:04,694
It's hard to care
for something you're not investing in.

530
00:35:04,857 --> 00:35:07,792
Along with refraining
from any negative comments...

531
00:35:07,962 --> 00:35:11,671
... buy your wife something that says
you were thinking of her today.

532
00:35:12,665 --> 00:35:15,961
Yeah, I need to order some flowers
or something for my wife.

533
00:35:16,123 --> 00:35:18,195
No. No, it doesn't matter.

534
00:35:18,938 --> 00:35:21,273
Sure. How much does that cost?

535
00:35:21,435 --> 00:35:25,265
Forty-five?
Do you have something cheaper?

536
00:35:25,979 --> 00:35:29,558
Yeah, yeah, that's more like it.
Let's go with the 25.

537
00:35:29,724 --> 00:35:32,342
How about a box of chocolates
or something?

538
00:35:32,508 --> 00:35:34,035
How much is that?

539
00:35:35,036 --> 00:35:36,793
You're killing me.

540
00:35:37,501 --> 00:35:39,158
That's better.

541
00:35:39,324 --> 00:35:41,813
Okay, how about
a little stuffed bear?

542
00:35:41,981 --> 00:35:43,769
All right, forget the bear.

543
00:35:44,156 --> 00:35:47,157
How long is it gonna take you
to throw something like that together?

544
00:36:04,415 --> 00:36:06,138
Man, you done lost your mind.

545
00:36:06,303 --> 00:36:09,118
Terrell, I can bench 300 right now.

546
00:36:09,279 --> 00:36:10,262
For real?

547
00:36:10,431 --> 00:36:12,765
Why can't we all come
to the same obvious conclusion?

548
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:14,357
That I am the man.

549
00:36:14,528 --> 00:36:17,910
All I know is the man
left the thermal-imaging device...

550
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:20,120
...on the bumper of the truck
last night.

551
00:36:20,288 --> 00:36:23,070
- That's an $8000 piece of equipment.
- My bad, captain.

552
00:36:23,232 --> 00:36:24,640
That doesn't change the fact...

553
00:36:24,801 --> 00:36:27,321
...when it comes to difficult situations,
I can take it.

554
00:36:27,489 --> 00:36:28,918
Man, I can't take this much ego.

555
00:36:29,089 --> 00:36:31,511
You've been bragging on yourself
for 10 minutes, man.

556
00:36:31,682 --> 00:36:33,175
It ain't bragging if it's true.

557
00:36:33,345 --> 00:36:36,216
Last week at the apartment fire,
I pulled off two attack lines...

558
00:36:36,386 --> 00:36:39,201
...laid my own supply line
and caught a hydrant in two minutes.

559
00:36:39,362 --> 00:36:42,014
- Other folks could do that, man.
- Not from this station.

560
00:36:42,179 --> 00:36:44,153
- Tom McBride could.
- At Station 4?

561
00:36:44,323 --> 00:36:47,193
He might do it in two and a half,
but he can't do it under two.

562
00:36:47,683 --> 00:36:48,893
- I don't know.
- Captain...

563
00:36:49,059 --> 00:36:51,296
...he's strong, but he's not as fast.

564
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:53,401
I could take him
any day of the week.

565
00:36:54,755 --> 00:36:56,665
Wayne, you seem
pretty high on yourself.

566
00:36:56,836 --> 00:37:00,283
I think confidence is a good thing,
but you're over the top.

567
00:37:00,451 --> 00:37:01,793
Man, he way over the top.

568
00:37:01,956 --> 00:37:03,779
I can back it up.
That's all I'm saying.

569
00:37:04,773 --> 00:37:05,754
Wrath of God, baby.

570
00:37:05,924 --> 00:37:08,925
- What's that for?
- We're about to have a little contest.

571
00:37:09,093 --> 00:37:11,613
We're just gonna see
if Wayne really is the man.

572
00:37:11,781 --> 00:37:13,570
That is, if he's for the challenge.

573
00:37:13,734 --> 00:37:15,873
I'm all about this.

574
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:18,627
All right.

575
00:37:19,334 --> 00:37:20,316
I'll go first.

576
00:37:20,486 --> 00:37:22,428
- What are you gonna do?
- Michael, time me.

577
00:37:22,598 --> 00:37:24,703
You got it. Ready?

578
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:26,147
Go.

579
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:30,687
No way.

580
00:37:30,855 --> 00:37:32,927
Man, you crazy.

581
00:37:33,094 --> 00:37:35,397
He gonna drink the whole thing.

582
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,960
Twenty-three seconds.

583
00:37:52,137 --> 00:37:53,927
All right, man. You're up.

584
00:37:54,089 --> 00:37:56,773
All right. That was impressive.

585
00:37:56,938 --> 00:37:59,043
Till I do it under 20.

586
00:37:59,657 --> 00:38:01,633
- Time me.
- Oh, I'll time you.

587
00:38:02,058 --> 00:38:03,585
- Ready?
- Ladies.

588
00:38:03,755 --> 00:38:05,063
Go.

589
00:38:09,419 --> 00:38:10,596
- Come on, Wayne.
- It's hot.

590
00:38:10,762 --> 00:38:12,705
- Go, Wayne.
- That's it, Wayne.

591
00:38:12,875 --> 00:38:14,533
How about you take it?

592
00:38:16,459 --> 00:38:18,564
- You gotta drink that, bro.
- Fourteen seconds.

593
00:38:20,235 --> 00:38:22,406
- Come on.
- It burns!

594
00:38:23,371 --> 00:38:25,412
Where the man at now, huh?

595
00:38:25,581 --> 00:38:27,947
I thought he said he could take it.

596
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:30,729
My mouth's on fire!

597
00:38:32,492 --> 00:38:35,144
Captain, how'd you do that, man?

598
00:38:35,309 --> 00:38:36,771
You could do it too, Terrell...

599
00:38:36,942 --> 00:38:39,494
...if you replaced yours
with tomato juice.

600
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:45,420
That is classic. That was awesome.

601
00:38:47,182 --> 00:38:49,004
Dr. Anderson?

602
00:38:49,166 --> 00:38:51,622
Wanted to remind you
about your interview in 10 minutes.

603
00:38:51,791 --> 00:38:53,514
Catherine, thank you. I'll be there.

604
00:38:53,679 --> 00:38:55,686
Congratulations
on your cancer-research award.

605
00:38:55,855 --> 00:38:58,605
- You deserve it.
- I appreciate that.

606
00:38:58,768 --> 00:38:59,945
This is Catherine.

607
00:39:00,111 --> 00:39:03,428
Hey, it's Caleb.
I wanted to call and check on you.

608
00:39:04,304 --> 00:39:07,303
You wanted to check on me?
What for?

609
00:39:08,528 --> 00:39:10,633
You know,
just see if you needed anything.

610
00:39:12,208 --> 00:39:14,216
You called to see
if I needed anything?

611
00:39:14,385 --> 00:39:17,614
Right, yeah. You want me
to bring something home for you...

612
00:39:17,777 --> 00:39:20,495
... or get something from the store
in the morning?

613
00:39:20,658 --> 00:39:23,920
Caleb, you never asked me this
before. What's going on?

614
00:39:24,082 --> 00:39:27,016
I just wanted to see
if you needed anything, that's it.

615
00:39:27,186 --> 00:39:28,812
I'm fine.

616
00:39:29,426 --> 00:39:30,888
Okay.

617
00:39:31,538 --> 00:39:33,480
All right, well...

618
00:39:33,651 --> 00:39:35,080
...goodbye.

619
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:43,437
Day four, done.

620
00:39:48,244 --> 00:39:50,481
Hey, Cat, how you doing, girl?

621
00:39:50,644 --> 00:39:52,400
Confused.

622
00:39:53,109 --> 00:39:55,694
- My husband's acting weird.
- What's he doing?

623
00:39:56,212 --> 00:39:59,561
Well, in the last few days...

624
00:39:59,732 --> 00:40:04,719
...he has fixed me coffee,
bought me these pitiful little flowers...

625
00:40:04,885 --> 00:40:08,017
...and just now,
called just to see if I'm doing okay.

626
00:40:08,502 --> 00:40:10,389
- Really?
- Yeah.

627
00:40:10,549 --> 00:40:11,891
I'll tell you what he's doing.

628
00:40:12,054 --> 00:40:14,259
He's trying to butter you up
for a divorce.

629
00:40:14,423 --> 00:40:15,699
And why would he do that?

630
00:40:15,862 --> 00:40:17,651
Before my cousin Luwanna
got a divorce...

631
00:40:17,815 --> 00:40:19,342
...her husband did the same thing.

632
00:40:19,511 --> 00:40:21,932
He started acting nice and sweet,
next thing we know...

633
00:40:22,103 --> 00:40:24,559
...he walks away with the house
and most of their money.

634
00:40:24,728 --> 00:40:28,470
He hasn't even talked to her since.
Don't you let him deceive you, girl.

635
00:40:54,426 --> 00:40:56,434
Did you clear your history?

636
00:40:57,179 --> 00:40:58,837
What?

637
00:40:59,002 --> 00:41:02,386
Did you wipe the websites off so
nobody would see where you've been?

638
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:09,911
You know, Caleb,
you're not fooling anybody.

639
00:41:10,075 --> 00:41:11,602
I know what you're trying to do...

640
00:41:11,772 --> 00:41:14,423
...buying me flowers
and calling me at work.

641
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:16,594
And what is that?

642
00:41:16,764 --> 00:41:19,350
I'm meeting with a lawyer next week,
and don't you think...

643
00:41:19,517 --> 00:41:21,906
...I'm buying into
this nice-guy routine.

644
00:41:22,077 --> 00:41:24,150
What are you talking about?

645
00:41:25,309 --> 00:41:27,480
You're not getting one dime
more than you deserve.

646
00:41:27,645 --> 00:41:30,232
When this divorce is final,
I'm taking my share.

647
00:41:30,398 --> 00:41:33,813
- Is that what you think I'm doing?
- No, I know that's what you're doing.

648
00:41:33,981 --> 00:41:35,029
Well, you're wrong.

649
00:41:35,198 --> 00:41:38,045
You never assume I would do anything
worthy of respect.

650
00:41:38,206 --> 00:41:39,832
- Anything honourable.
- Honourable?

651
00:41:40,031 --> 00:41:42,452
Honourable?
What were you just looking at, Caleb?

652
00:41:42,622 --> 00:41:45,623
What was on that computer screen?
Was that honourable?

653
00:41:45,791 --> 00:41:47,199
Who do you think you're fooling?

654
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:50,109
Do you know why your sweet
little gestures mean nothing to me?

655
00:41:50,271 --> 00:41:52,443
It's because that's the kind of man
you've become.

656
00:41:52,608 --> 00:41:54,615
When you're alone,
that's what you default to.

657
00:41:54,784 --> 00:41:57,086
And there is nothing honourable
about it.

658
00:42:23,523 --> 00:42:25,181
Mr. Rudolph.

659
00:42:26,050 --> 00:42:27,611
Caleb.

660
00:42:43,588 --> 00:42:45,694
- Hello?
- It's not working, Dad.

661
00:42:45,861 --> 00:42:46,876
What's not working?

662
00:42:47,045 --> 00:42:49,313
This whole love dare thing.
It is not working.

663
00:42:49,989 --> 00:42:51,483
Tell me what's going on.

664
00:42:52,134 --> 00:42:54,305
I have been doing everything
that it says to do...

665
00:42:54,469 --> 00:42:56,804
...and she has completely rejected
all of it.

666
00:42:56,966 --> 00:42:59,202
Caleb, this process takes 40 days,
not four.

667
00:42:59,366 --> 00:43:01,538
What's the point of going down
a dead-end road...

668
00:43:01,702 --> 00:43:04,516
- ... when it's not going anywhere?
- You don't know that yet.

669
00:43:04,678 --> 00:43:05,954
Caleb, you're not a quitter.

670
00:43:06,118 --> 00:43:10,047
And something tells me
you're doing just enough to get by.

671
00:43:10,950 --> 00:43:12,325
Am I right?

672
00:43:17,863 --> 00:43:20,830
- I feel nothing.
- I understand, son.

673
00:43:20,999 --> 00:43:23,367
But this is not based on feelings.

674
00:43:23,528 --> 00:43:24,772
It's a decision.

675
00:43:24,937 --> 00:43:26,977
You can't give up yet.

676
00:43:27,144 --> 00:43:29,152
Keep taking a day at a time.

677
00:43:32,297 --> 00:43:33,279
Yes, sir.

678
00:43:34,121 --> 00:43:35,715
I love you, son.

679
00:43:36,745 --> 00:43:38,371
You too, Dad.

680
00:43:46,666 --> 00:43:48,291
How is he?

681
00:43:49,002 --> 00:43:51,588
We've gotta start
praying for him more.

682
00:43:54,539 --> 00:43:57,093
Mama, I don't know what to do.

683
00:43:58,219 --> 00:44:02,563
I know you always told me to hang on
during the hard times, but...

684
00:44:05,708 --> 00:44:09,025
You don't know
what I've been competing with.

685
00:44:09,708 --> 00:44:11,912
I mean, when he look...

686
00:44:17,293 --> 00:44:21,352
He makes me feel so humiliated.

687
00:44:22,062 --> 00:44:24,550
And he doesn't even know it.

688
00:44:28,110 --> 00:44:31,972
When did I stop
being good enough for him?

689
00:45:41,397 --> 00:45:43,285
So, what day are you on?

690
00:45:44,502 --> 00:45:46,291
- Eighteen.
- And?

691
00:45:47,830 --> 00:45:49,172
And it's still difficult.

692
00:45:49,942 --> 00:45:52,844
Every day has me adding
a new concept to the way I treat her.

693
00:45:53,462 --> 00:45:54,444
For example?

694
00:45:55,094 --> 00:45:57,135
Well, here.

695
00:45:57,302 --> 00:46:00,303
Day 16 was about praying for her.
I kind of skipped that one.

696
00:46:01,047 --> 00:46:04,080
Day 17 is about listening to her.

697
00:46:04,247 --> 00:46:06,419
Eighteen's about
studying her again.

698
00:46:06,936 --> 00:46:08,496
- Studying her?
- Yeah.

699
00:46:08,695 --> 00:46:10,103
Here.

700
00:46:10,808 --> 00:46:13,742
"When a man is trying to win the heart
of a woman, he studies her.

701
00:46:13,912 --> 00:46:16,368
He learns her likes, dislikes,
habits and hobbies.

702
00:46:16,537 --> 00:46:18,676
But after he wins her heart
and marries her...

703
00:46:18,841 --> 00:46:20,946
...he often stops learning about her.

704
00:46:21,113 --> 00:46:23,153
If the amount he studied her
before marriage...

705
00:46:23,321 --> 00:46:26,419
...was equal to a high school degree,
he should continue to learn...

706
00:46:26,585 --> 00:46:29,488
...until he gains a college degree,
a master's degree...

707
00:46:29,658 --> 00:46:31,600
...and ultimately, a doctorate degree.

708
00:46:31,770 --> 00:46:36,112
It is a lifelong journey that draws
his heart ever closer to hers."

709
00:46:36,282 --> 00:46:39,218
That's a pretty good concept.
I never thought about it like that.

710
00:46:40,858 --> 00:46:43,030
So do you study Tina?

711
00:46:43,195 --> 00:46:45,781
Yeah, but I don't think
I got my college degree on her yet.

712
00:46:47,579 --> 00:46:50,263
So tell me a little bit more
about the studying her.

713
00:46:50,428 --> 00:46:53,242
I'm supposed to make her
a candlelight dinner...

714
00:46:53,404 --> 00:46:55,576
...and then ask her
a whole list of questions.

715
00:46:56,060 --> 00:46:57,969
Well, my advice is go all out.

716
00:46:58,684 --> 00:46:59,666
Meaning?

717
00:46:59,837 --> 00:47:02,706
Don't go cheap. If you don't cook,
get it from a good restaurant.

718
00:47:02,877 --> 00:47:07,068
Take it home, use your best dishes,
glasses, music, everything.

719
00:47:07,229 --> 00:47:09,017
Make it a memorable date.

720
00:47:12,190 --> 00:47:13,433
Man, what you talking about?

721
00:47:13,597 --> 00:47:16,631
- You ain't had a date in a year.
- I'm like a fine wine.

722
00:47:16,798 --> 00:47:19,002
I need about 35 years
to reach perfection.

723
00:47:19,166 --> 00:47:22,483
But the lady that gets Wayne Floyd,
she'll get the complete package.

724
00:47:22,655 --> 00:47:24,662
- You mean complete wreckage.
- No.

725
00:47:25,118 --> 00:47:27,704
I'm 255 pounds of pure love.

726
00:47:27,871 --> 00:47:30,686
All you need to make marriage work
is a little bit of romance.

727
00:47:30,847 --> 00:47:32,473
And that comes from right here.

728
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:35,575
Man, that's easy to say
when you ain't never been married.

729
00:47:35,743 --> 00:47:37,271
It's a lot harder than you think.

730
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:40,027
One day I'm gonna walk in
with a tanned beauty on my arm.

731
00:47:40,193 --> 00:47:41,785
I'll show you how easy it can be.

732
00:47:41,952 --> 00:47:44,538
The only thing you'll come in with
hanging from your arm...

733
00:47:44,705 --> 00:47:46,712
...is a bucket of chicken.

734
00:47:48,225 --> 00:47:49,883
It was tomato juice.

735
00:48:01,827 --> 00:48:04,412
Tomato juice? Man, that's wrong!

736
00:48:04,578 --> 00:48:07,099
- That's wrong.
- What's wrong?

737
00:48:07,267 --> 00:48:09,438
I drank the real stuff
and he drank tomato juice?

738
00:48:09,603 --> 00:48:10,683
You just got that?

739
00:48:10,851 --> 00:48:12,510
Do you know
what that stuff did to me?

740
00:48:12,675 --> 00:48:13,984
Go to bed, Wayne.

741
00:48:14,147 --> 00:48:17,464
- There's some serious repercussions.
- Quiet.

742
00:48:17,636 --> 00:48:19,578
Oh, it's on now.

743
00:48:20,484 --> 00:48:22,623
Done lit a fuse.

744
00:48:22,788 --> 00:48:26,137
Somebody's gonna get
a karate-chop sandwich.

745
00:49:38,188 --> 00:49:39,268
What are you doing?

746
00:49:42,411 --> 00:49:44,746
Maybe I'd like to have dinner
with my wife.

747
00:49:50,381 --> 00:49:52,388
Let me be real clear with you
about something.

748
00:49:55,277 --> 00:49:57,798
I do not love you.

749
00:50:41,553 --> 00:50:43,310
Oh, son.

750
00:50:43,986 --> 00:50:46,375
This is when it gets hard.

751
00:50:47,666 --> 00:50:49,968
- Hello, Caleb.
- We're done, Dad.

752
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:54,059
I am not gonna keep doing this.
I have tried and there's nothing there.

753
00:50:54,227 --> 00:50:55,405
It's not worth it.

754
00:50:55,571 --> 00:50:57,840
I understand, son,
but you're halfway there...

755
00:50:58,002 --> 00:50:59,912
...which was the most difficult
for us too.

756
00:51:00,083 --> 00:51:02,930
But at least you had some hope.
She has given me nothing.

757
00:51:03,091 --> 00:51:05,514
There was a point
when we had no hope either.

758
00:51:05,683 --> 00:51:07,690
Our marriage should have ended,
Caleb.

759
00:51:07,859 --> 00:51:10,129
You can't listen to the way you feel
at the moment.

760
00:51:10,292 --> 00:51:11,470
She's seen you trying.

761
00:51:11,637 --> 00:51:15,980
No, she doesn't care, Dad.
None of this means anything to her.

762
00:51:16,148 --> 00:51:17,578
Dad, I tried.

763
00:51:19,221 --> 00:51:20,465
Caleb, are you off tomorrow?

764
00:51:21,397 --> 00:51:22,379
Yeah, why?

765
00:51:22,902 --> 00:51:25,291
I'm coming to see you.
We can talk then.

766
00:51:26,549 --> 00:51:28,175
Dad, you don't have to do that.

767
00:51:28,693 --> 00:51:31,596
I want to, son. I'd like to come.

768
00:51:33,623 --> 00:51:35,411
All right.

769
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:02,487
Dad, I gotta be honest with you.

770
00:52:02,649 --> 00:52:05,945
I feel bad that you drove four hours
just to come see me.

771
00:52:06,106 --> 00:52:09,554
It was good.
It gave me time to think and pray.

772
00:52:09,722 --> 00:52:12,405
So, what are you on, Day 20?

773
00:52:12,570 --> 00:52:15,385
- Yeah, yeah, something like that.
- Yeah.

774
00:52:15,546 --> 00:52:17,815
I'd say the halfway point
was the hardest for us.

775
00:52:18,298 --> 00:52:19,792
Why?

776
00:52:19,962 --> 00:52:23,574
Well, it's when you determine
whether your heart's in it or not.

777
00:52:23,739 --> 00:52:27,089
Makes you check your real motives
when things get difficult.

778
00:52:27,516 --> 00:52:29,490
Yeah?
Did Mom give you a hard time?

779
00:52:29,660 --> 00:52:33,338
No. I thought your mother
had a pretty good attitude about it.

780
00:52:33,501 --> 00:52:35,802
Yeah, well,
Catherine's not buying any of it.

781
00:52:35,964 --> 00:52:38,420
- Why do you think that is?
- Because she doesn't love me.

782
00:52:38,589 --> 00:52:39,798
She doesn't even like me.

783
00:52:39,964 --> 00:52:43,544
Dad, she's just about ignored
everything I've done.

784
00:52:43,710 --> 00:52:46,328
Are you reading everything
on each page?

785
00:52:47,933 --> 00:52:50,104
You mean the Bible verses
at the bottom of it?

786
00:52:50,269 --> 00:52:51,928
No, I'm not, Dad.

787
00:52:52,094 --> 00:52:55,542
- I told you, that is not what I need.
- And what do you need?

788
00:52:55,709 --> 00:53:00,053
I need Catherine to wake up to the fact
that we are about to get a divorce.

789
00:53:00,223 --> 00:53:03,419
And I'm trying to prevent that,
but I cannot do it by myself.

790
00:53:03,582 --> 00:53:07,259
That may be true,
but I think you need more than that.

791
00:53:08,543 --> 00:53:10,999
Dad, if you're gonna tell me
I need Jesus, please don't.

792
00:53:11,168 --> 00:53:13,404
I don't need a crutch
to get through life.

793
00:53:13,568 --> 00:53:15,641
Oh, son,
Jesus is much more than a crutch.

794
00:53:15,808 --> 00:53:18,874
He's become the most significant part
of our lives.

795
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:20,502
Dad, why do you keep saying that?

796
00:53:20,672 --> 00:53:23,771
He's the most significant part?
How is that?

797
00:53:23,936 --> 00:53:28,671
When I realized who I was
and who he was...

798
00:53:28,833 --> 00:53:30,743
...I realized my need for him.

799
00:53:30,913 --> 00:53:34,044
I needed his forgiveness
and salvation.

800
00:53:35,234 --> 00:53:37,339
See, I don't understand that.

801
00:53:37,506 --> 00:53:41,151
Why do I need his salvation?
What, am I gonna be thrown into hell?

802
00:53:41,315 --> 00:53:44,413
For what? Because I got divorced?

803
00:53:44,578 --> 00:53:46,040
No.

804
00:53:46,211 --> 00:53:48,513
Because you violated his standards.

805
00:53:48,675 --> 00:53:51,097
What? Thou shall not kill?

806
00:53:51,267 --> 00:53:53,439
Dad, I help people.
I am a good person.

807
00:53:53,603 --> 00:53:55,011
According to you.

808
00:53:55,171 --> 00:53:57,627
But God doesn't judge
by your standards.

809
00:53:57,795 --> 00:53:59,901
- He uses his.
- And what are his?

810
00:54:00,068 --> 00:54:02,140
Well, truth.

811
00:54:02,308 --> 00:54:03,290
- Okay.
- Love.

812
00:54:03,460 --> 00:54:05,053
- I'm honest.
- Faithfulness.

813
00:54:05,220 --> 00:54:07,587
I care about people.
I am those things.

814
00:54:07,748 --> 00:54:09,123
Sometimes.

815
00:54:09,285 --> 00:54:13,987
But have you loved God,
the one who gave you life?

816
00:54:14,150 --> 00:54:19,365
His standards are so high,
he considers hatred to be murder...

817
00:54:19,525 --> 00:54:23,388
...and lust to be adultery.

818
00:54:27,079 --> 00:54:29,948
Dad, what about
all the good I've done?

819
00:54:30,119 --> 00:54:33,502
Son, saving someone from a fire
does not make you right with God.

820
00:54:33,670 --> 00:54:35,875
You've broken his commandments.

821
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:38,527
And one day,
you'll answer to him for that.

822
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:48,069
Caleb...

823
00:54:48,233 --> 00:54:50,785
...if I ask you why
you're so frustrated with Catherine...

824
00:54:50,952 --> 00:54:52,546
...what would you say?

825
00:54:56,554 --> 00:54:58,245
She's stubborn.

826
00:54:58,410 --> 00:55:00,995
She makes everything
difficult for me.

827
00:55:01,161 --> 00:55:02,754
She's ungrateful.

828
00:55:02,922 --> 00:55:05,476
She's constantly griping
about something.

829
00:55:05,642 --> 00:55:07,879
Has she thanked you
the last 20 days?

830
00:55:08,042 --> 00:55:09,286
No.

831
00:55:09,450 --> 00:55:11,238
And you'd think
after I washed the car...

832
00:55:11,403 --> 00:55:13,956
...I've changed the oil,
do the dishes, clean the house...

833
00:55:14,123 --> 00:55:17,287
...that she would try to show me
a little bit of gratitude.

834
00:55:17,451 --> 00:55:19,044
Well, she doesn't.

835
00:55:19,211 --> 00:55:22,986
In fact, when I come home,
she makes me feel like I'm an enemy.

836
00:55:23,147 --> 00:55:24,970
I'm not even welcome
in my own home, Dad.

837
00:55:25,132 --> 00:55:27,304
That is what really ticks me off.

838
00:55:27,468 --> 00:55:30,502
Dad, for the last three weeks,
I have bent over backwards for her.

839
00:55:30,668 --> 00:55:34,280
I have tried to demonstrate
that I still care about this relationship.

840
00:55:34,445 --> 00:55:37,031
I bought her flowers,
which she threw away.

841
00:55:37,197 --> 00:55:40,842
I have taken her insults
and her sarcasm, but last night was it.

842
00:55:41,006 --> 00:55:44,453
I made dinner for her, I did
everything I could to demonstrate...

843
00:55:44,621 --> 00:55:47,142
...that I care about her,
to show value for her...

844
00:55:47,310 --> 00:55:48,904
...and she spat in my face.

845
00:55:49,070 --> 00:55:52,453
She does not deserve this, Dad.
I am not doing it anymore.

846
00:55:52,623 --> 00:55:56,846
How am I supposed to show love
to somebody over and over and over...

847
00:55:57,007 --> 00:55:59,211
...who constantly rejects me?

848
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:04,014
That's a good question.

849
00:56:13,424 --> 00:56:15,465
Dad, that is not what I'm doing.

850
00:56:16,368 --> 00:56:18,027
Isn't it?

851
00:56:18,833 --> 00:56:19,913
No...

852
00:56:20,082 --> 00:56:21,772
Dad, that is not what this is about.

853
00:56:21,937 --> 00:56:24,076
Son, you just asked me:

854
00:56:24,241 --> 00:56:26,413
"How can someone show love
over and over again...

855
00:56:26,578 --> 00:56:29,066
...when they're constantly rejected?"

856
00:56:29,394 --> 00:56:31,499
Caleb, the answer is:

857
00:56:31,666 --> 00:56:33,127
You can't love her...

858
00:56:33,298 --> 00:56:36,201
...because you can't give her
what you don't have.

859
00:56:39,763 --> 00:56:43,407
I couldn't truly love your mother
till I understood what love really was.

860
00:56:44,436 --> 00:56:47,753
It's not because
I get some reward out of it.

861
00:56:47,925 --> 00:56:49,997
I've now made a decision
to love your mother...

862
00:56:50,164 --> 00:56:52,335
...whether she deserves it or not.

863
00:56:53,653 --> 00:56:57,362
Son, God loves you
even though you don't deserve it.

864
00:56:57,973 --> 00:57:00,362
Even though you've rejected him.

865
00:57:00,820 --> 00:57:02,479
Spat in his face.

866
00:57:04,405 --> 00:57:09,108
God sent Jesus to die on the cross
and take the punishment for your sin...

867
00:57:09,622 --> 00:57:11,596
...because he loves you.

868
00:57:12,854 --> 00:57:16,399
The cross was offensive to me
until I came to it.

869
00:57:17,654 --> 00:57:19,597
But when I did...

870
00:57:21,079 --> 00:57:23,217
...Jesus Christ changed my life.

871
00:57:23,703 --> 00:57:26,354
That's when I truly began
to love your mom.

872
00:57:28,471 --> 00:57:31,953
Son, I can't settle this for you.

873
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:34,509
This is between you and the Lord.

874
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:38,128
But I love you too much
not to tell you the truth.

875
00:57:39,705 --> 00:57:42,520
Can't you see that you need him?

876
00:57:48,346 --> 00:57:51,859
Can't you see
that you need his forgiveness?

877
00:57:55,834 --> 00:57:57,362
Yes.

878
00:57:59,866 --> 00:58:02,322
Will you trust him with your life?

879
00:58:30,654 --> 00:58:32,541
Waffle time.

880
00:58:33,022 --> 00:58:35,357
Hey, man,
I'd like to talk to you about something.

881
00:58:35,518 --> 00:58:37,111
What's that?

882
00:58:37,278 --> 00:58:39,350
- Well...
- Hey, captain.

883
00:58:40,191 --> 00:58:42,777
I think B shift
is trying to pull a joke on us, man.

884
00:58:42,942 --> 00:58:44,698
Salt and pepper shaker
won't come apart.

885
00:58:44,862 --> 00:58:46,586
Hey, toss them over here.

886
00:58:48,159 --> 00:58:50,614
Thanks. Don't forget
to mop the kitchen after breakfast.

887
00:58:50,783 --> 00:58:52,125
Yes, sir.

888
00:58:54,783 --> 00:58:56,606
You wanna tell me something?

889
00:58:59,232 --> 00:59:00,890
It's about your faith.

890
00:59:01,056 --> 00:59:03,196
- My faith?
- Yeah.

891
00:59:03,361 --> 00:59:04,887
What about it?

892
00:59:05,728 --> 00:59:08,314
Well, I'm in.

893
00:59:08,481 --> 00:59:09,725
You're in?

894
00:59:10,337 --> 00:59:11,897
Yeah, I'm in.

895
00:59:13,665 --> 00:59:15,421
Are you saying
that you wanna be in?

896
00:59:15,585 --> 00:59:18,520
- I'm saying I'm in.
- You're really in?

897
00:59:18,690 --> 00:59:20,861
- Really.
- You can't be half in and say you're in.

898
00:59:21,026 --> 00:59:24,027
- You gotta be all in, brother.
- I'm saying I'm all in.

899
00:59:24,195 --> 00:59:25,722
Caleb, I can't believe it, man.

900
00:59:25,891 --> 00:59:27,832
- Yeah.
- You're my brother.

901
00:59:28,003 --> 00:59:29,280
- I'm your brother?
- Yeah, man.

902
00:59:29,443 --> 00:59:33,087
You're my brother from another mother
but now we got the same father.

903
00:59:33,251 --> 00:59:35,074
- What?
- I'll explain it to you later, man.

904
00:59:35,235 --> 00:59:36,610
This is awesome.

905
00:59:36,772 --> 00:59:38,877
- Does Catherine know?
- No.

906
00:59:39,044 --> 00:59:42,012
No, I don't think she'd care right now,
to tell you the truth.

907
00:59:42,181 --> 00:59:45,410
She hasn't been taking too well
to this whole love dare thing.

908
00:59:45,573 --> 00:59:48,289
- But you're not done yet, right?
- No, I'm day 21 out of 40.

909
00:59:48,644 --> 00:59:51,012
But I'll be honest with you.
Up to this point...

910
00:59:51,173 --> 00:59:53,726
...my heart's not been in it.
- That's what matters.

911
00:59:53,893 --> 00:59:56,577
A woman can tell when you're
just going through the motions.

912
00:59:56,742 --> 00:59:58,782
That's absolutely right.

913
00:59:58,949 --> 01:00:01,503
- Hey, let me ask you a question.
- Go ahead.

914
01:00:02,342 --> 01:00:04,099
How did you get a good start
with Tina?

915
01:00:04,263 --> 01:00:05,756
Why is it so easy for you?

916
01:00:05,926 --> 01:00:08,774
Oh, it's not always been easy.
Marriage takes work, man.

917
01:00:09,351 --> 01:00:11,936
Tina is an incredible wife.

918
01:00:12,103 --> 01:00:14,078
But we learned a lot of lessons
the hard way.

919
01:00:16,807 --> 01:00:19,045
At least you haven't
had to face divorce.

920
01:00:21,927 --> 01:00:23,902
I wish that were true.

921
01:00:24,937 --> 01:00:26,758
What does that mean?

922
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:28,743
You and Tina
been struggling that much?

923
01:00:29,897 --> 01:00:33,475
Not me and Tina.
But I did with my first wife.

924
01:00:37,481 --> 01:00:38,976
What?

925
01:00:39,433 --> 01:00:41,768
You were married to someone
before Tina?

926
01:00:42,378 --> 01:00:44,767
For one horrible year.

927
01:00:44,938 --> 01:00:46,662
I got married for the wrong reasons.

928
01:00:46,827 --> 01:00:49,827
Then I turned around and got
a divorce for the wrong reasons.

929
01:00:50,155 --> 01:00:53,003
Man, I thought
I was just following my heart.

930
01:00:53,866 --> 01:00:55,841
Michael, I've worked with you
for five years.

931
01:00:56,011 --> 01:00:58,728
- You've never told me that.
- Because I'm not proud of it.

932
01:00:59,083 --> 01:01:01,571
It was before I gave my life
to the Lord...

933
01:01:01,740 --> 01:01:05,056
...and, man, I was just only concerned
about my rights and my needs.

934
01:01:05,228 --> 01:01:07,334
Man, I ruined her life.

935
01:01:07,501 --> 01:01:10,500
But when I gave my life to God...

936
01:01:10,668 --> 01:01:13,157
...I tried to find her,
but she'd already remarried.

937
01:01:13,325 --> 01:01:16,620
So believe me when I tell you
I got a big scar.

938
01:01:16,781 --> 01:01:19,629
Man, God made marriage
to be for life.

939
01:01:21,005 --> 01:01:24,235
That's why you gotta keep your vows
to Catherine.

940
01:01:24,398 --> 01:01:27,747
You gotta beg God to teach you
how to be a good husband.

941
01:01:27,918 --> 01:01:31,334
And don't just follow your heart, man,
because your heart can be deceived.

942
01:01:31,790 --> 01:01:35,501
But you gotta lead your heart.

943
01:01:40,944 --> 01:01:43,245
It's just been hard for me, you know?

944
01:01:43,407 --> 01:01:45,230
I saw my parents again yesterday...

945
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:48,967
...and, well,
Mom's not doing too well.

946
01:01:49,648 --> 01:01:53,542
It's amazing how much a stroke
can affect somebody's life.

947
01:01:53,712 --> 01:01:55,142
I just...

948
01:01:55,312 --> 01:01:57,582
I feel like she's trapped, you know?

949
01:01:57,745 --> 01:01:59,632
And Dad does his best
to communicate...

950
01:01:59,793 --> 01:02:02,095
...but it's hard for him too.

951
01:02:03,985 --> 01:02:05,579
Catherine, I'm so sorry.

952
01:02:06,066 --> 01:02:08,172
You seem very close to them.

953
01:02:08,339 --> 01:02:09,385
I am.

954
01:02:10,290 --> 01:02:13,455
They had me late in life so it was like
growing up with grandparents.

955
01:02:13,619 --> 01:02:14,828
So they spoiled you.

956
01:02:14,994 --> 01:02:17,199
Hey, now.
I think they did a pretty good job.

957
01:02:17,619 --> 01:02:19,594
They did.
They should be very proud.

958
01:02:20,851 --> 01:02:23,634
You know, you're kind of sweet
when you wanna be.

959
01:02:23,796 --> 01:02:25,486
Kind of?

960
01:02:25,651 --> 01:02:28,205
With some training,
I think you could be a fine gentleman.

961
01:02:28,372 --> 01:02:29,779
Well, are you offering lessons?

962
01:02:31,508 --> 01:02:34,508
So, what does your mom need?

963
01:02:36,021 --> 01:02:38,672
Well, a better wheelchair
and hospital bed...

964
01:02:38,837 --> 01:02:40,779
...would be at the top of the list.

965
01:02:40,949 --> 01:02:44,265
I've been working with
RMS Medical Supplies to get them...

966
01:02:44,437 --> 01:02:45,615
...but it's so expensive.

967
01:02:46,101 --> 01:02:48,883
Well, you can't put a price
on helping your mom.

968
01:02:49,046 --> 01:02:50,672
That's right.

969
01:02:51,318 --> 01:02:53,620
So it's worth the sacrifice.

970
01:02:53,782 --> 01:02:56,303
You know, they're lucky
to have you for a daughter.

971
01:02:58,871 --> 01:03:01,075
Don't look at me like that.
I'm trying to help.

972
01:03:01,239 --> 01:03:03,759
Why does it matter
what my bed looks like? I sleep in it.

973
01:03:03,927 --> 01:03:07,670
What if the chief walks through here?
My bed says I take my job seriously.

974
01:03:07,832 --> 01:03:10,253
Your bed says your mama didn't
help you make it up.

975
01:03:10,424 --> 01:03:12,180
Teaching a rookie
how to make his bed?

976
01:03:12,344 --> 01:03:14,101
Somebody's got to.

977
01:03:14,265 --> 01:03:17,167
That looks as bad as yours did
when I taught you.

978
01:03:22,169 --> 01:03:25,268
Engine 2, Engine 1,
Area 1, Battalion 1.

979
01:03:25,433 --> 01:03:27,703
Respond to 20911th Avenue.

980
01:03:27,866 --> 01:03:30,800
Structure fire, residence.
Time out, 15:32.

981
01:03:30,969 --> 01:03:32,376
- Michael, you got that?
- Got it.

982
01:03:32,537 --> 01:03:34,261
- Wayne, let's roll.
- Got it.

983
01:03:46,652 --> 01:03:49,553
Engine 1 is en route
to 20911th Avenue, structure fire.

984
01:03:49,723 --> 01:03:51,131
10-4, Engine 1.

985
01:03:51,292 --> 01:03:55,154
Be advised we've received numerous
calls regarding this structure fire.

986
01:03:55,452 --> 01:03:57,427
That means
there's something to this one.

987
01:03:57,596 --> 01:03:59,418
Make sure you're tightened up.

988
01:04:06,653 --> 01:04:08,889
Remember your training.
Stay with your partner.

989
01:04:09,053 --> 01:04:10,395
Yes, sir.

990
01:04:10,557 --> 01:04:11,638
Engine 1 is 10-23.

991
01:04:11,805 --> 01:04:14,740
We have a single-story
brick dwelling, 30 percent involved.

992
01:04:14,910 --> 01:04:16,885
We'll be using
a 1 " and 3-quarter for rescue.

993
01:04:17,054 --> 01:04:19,159
We'll be 11th Avenue Command.
Engine 2, bring me a line.

994
01:04:19,326 --> 01:04:22,839
Be advised there is a hydrant
right next to Engine 1.

995
01:04:23,007 --> 01:04:24,981
Unit 2's clear. One supply line.

996
01:04:26,110 --> 01:04:28,020
Come on, rookie, let's go.

997
01:04:28,416 --> 01:04:30,488
You live here?
Is everyone out of the house?

998
01:04:30,655 --> 01:04:33,143
My daughter's in the neighbour's
house. This is our home.

999
01:04:33,312 --> 01:04:35,702
- Please, put that fire out.
- We will, just stay clear.

1000
01:04:35,871 --> 01:04:37,660
- Please, please.
- Oh, no. No.

1001
01:04:37,824 --> 01:04:39,963
Megan, Megan, where's Lacey?

1002
01:04:40,129 --> 01:04:42,998
- She went home already.
- You mean she's not at your house?

1003
01:04:43,169 --> 01:04:45,308
No, I was just talking to her
on the phone.

1004
01:04:45,473 --> 01:04:47,295
Lacey!

1005
01:04:48,417 --> 01:04:49,944
- You can't go in there.
- Lacey, no!

1006
01:04:50,113 --> 01:04:52,447
- You can't go in there.
- Let me go. Please let me go.

1007
01:04:52,865 --> 01:04:54,654
My baby!

1008
01:04:54,818 --> 01:04:57,632
- Let's go, let's go.
- Come on, guys, let's go.

1009
01:04:58,849 --> 01:05:00,857
Lacey!

1010
01:05:02,595 --> 01:05:04,798
My baby.

1011
01:05:07,780 --> 01:05:09,405
Come on, guys. Come on, guys.

1012
01:05:10,627 --> 01:05:11,871
Let's go.

1013
01:05:13,636 --> 01:05:15,490
- It's done.
- Charge.

1014
01:05:22,981 --> 01:05:25,053
Lacey!

1015
01:05:25,220 --> 01:05:26,267
Lacey!

1016
01:05:27,429 --> 01:05:29,568
Lacey!

1017
01:05:30,180 --> 01:05:32,090
Lacey!

1018
01:05:34,117 --> 01:05:36,004
Lacey!

1019
01:05:36,965 --> 01:05:39,836
- Get in there, guys, get in there.
- Lacey.

1020
01:05:44,230 --> 01:05:47,230
Lacey! Lacey!

1021
01:05:47,814 --> 01:05:49,440
Come on.
Over here, man. Over here.

1022
01:05:59,175 --> 01:06:00,998
Back out, back out, back out.

1023
01:06:15,465 --> 01:06:17,604
Over here!

1024
01:06:18,090 --> 01:06:19,463
Over here!

1025
01:06:27,467 --> 01:06:30,401
There's a hydrant over there.
Give me one supply line to Engine 1.

1026
01:06:30,570 --> 01:06:32,458
Hey, we got two people inside.
We need you.

1027
01:06:32,619 --> 01:06:34,442
Hey, hurry up with that supply line.

1028
01:06:34,603 --> 01:06:36,457
Get back in there, get back in there.

1029
01:06:36,619 --> 01:06:39,140
Breathe. Breathe, Lacey.
Breathe for me.

1030
01:06:40,971 --> 01:06:44,168
Captain, you gotta get out of the
house. The roof is about to give.

1031
01:06:44,332 --> 01:06:46,983
Captain, do you read me?
You've gotta get out.

1032
01:06:51,245 --> 01:06:54,441
God, get me out of here.
Get us out of here.

1033
01:08:45,719 --> 01:08:47,313
There, there.

1034
01:08:48,215 --> 01:08:50,769
Get the girl. Get the girl.

1035
01:09:02,648 --> 01:09:03,990
With the x-ray showing that...

1036
01:09:04,153 --> 01:09:07,154
...he's left with a partial thickness burn
to the arm.

1037
01:09:12,058 --> 01:09:13,104
You look terrible.

1038
01:09:16,027 --> 01:09:17,172
I feel terrible.

1039
01:09:19,002 --> 01:09:20,213
You gonna be okay?

1040
01:09:20,379 --> 01:09:23,030
He sustained some first-degree
burns, but he should be fine.

1041
01:09:23,994 --> 01:09:26,134
So this is your husband?

1042
01:09:28,571 --> 01:09:31,254
- Yes.
- You've got a hero on your hands.

1043
01:09:31,419 --> 01:09:34,038
Sir, I need you to keep this arm
elevated for 24 hours...

1044
01:09:34,204 --> 01:09:35,611
...to help the swelling go down.

1045
01:09:35,772 --> 01:09:38,041
Come back in 48 hours
to get it checked out again.

1046
01:09:38,205 --> 01:09:41,620
- Well, let me get out of your way.
- You're not in our way. You can stay.

1047
01:09:41,789 --> 01:09:45,979
No, it's all right.
I'll let you do your job.

1048
01:09:47,901 --> 01:09:50,236
I'm gonna get you more gauze
to take home with you...

1049
01:09:50,398 --> 01:09:53,115
...and fill that prescription
for your pain, okay?

1050
01:10:02,879 --> 01:10:04,919
I wouldn't put that ring
back on your finger...

1051
01:10:05,087 --> 01:10:07,575
...until your hand
has a chance to heal.

1052
01:10:09,151 --> 01:10:11,672
My hand's gonna have to heal
with this ring on my finger.

1053
01:10:21,473 --> 01:10:22,880
Mom, it'll be fine.

1054
01:10:23,041 --> 01:10:25,343
It's gonna heal up
in a couple of weeks.

1055
01:10:26,209 --> 01:10:30,366
Yes, I got it wrapped up right now.
Can I speak with Dad, please?

1056
01:10:31,330 --> 01:10:32,345
Okay, Mom, I got it.

1057
01:10:32,513 --> 01:10:35,295
Now, would you please
hand the phone to Dad?

1058
01:10:35,649 --> 01:10:37,210
Thank you.

1059
01:10:38,818 --> 01:10:41,600
Dad, would you please ask Mom
to cut me some slack?

1060
01:10:41,762 --> 01:10:44,545
I'm a fireman.
I'm gonna be around fires.

1061
01:10:45,090 --> 01:10:46,465
I know. I know, Dad.

1062
01:10:46,627 --> 01:10:50,206
I just don't like getting grilled
every time she picks up the phone.

1063
01:10:52,931 --> 01:10:55,779
Yeah. Today, Day 23.

1064
01:10:55,939 --> 01:10:58,044
But it was hard this morning.

1065
01:10:58,212 --> 01:11:00,930
Yeah, the newspaper called me twice
wanting an interview.

1066
01:11:01,093 --> 01:11:04,541
Seems I'm a hero with everybody
in the world except my wife.

1067
01:11:05,125 --> 01:11:07,612
No. No, I'm not giving up.

1068
01:11:08,836 --> 01:11:10,397
Thanks, Dad.

1069
01:11:11,398 --> 01:11:13,153
All right, I'll talk to you later.

1070
01:11:13,317 --> 01:11:14,594
Bye.

1071
01:12:03,178 --> 01:12:05,001
Caleb, what are you doing?

1072
01:12:35,373 --> 01:12:38,025
Why is this so hard?

1073
01:12:52,559 --> 01:12:55,428
Day 23, watch out for parasites.

1074
01:12:55,822 --> 01:12:59,140
A parasite is anything that latches
onto you or your partner...

1075
01:12:59,311 --> 01:13:01,548
... and sucks the life
out of your marriage.

1076
01:13:01,711 --> 01:13:04,494
They're usually in the form
of addictions like gambling...

1077
01:13:04,656 --> 01:13:06,281
... drugs or pornography.

1078
01:13:06,448 --> 01:13:09,067
They promise pleasure,
but they grow like a disease...

1079
01:13:09,232 --> 01:13:12,232
... and consume more and more
of your thoughts, time and money.

1080
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:16,525
They steal away your loyalty
and heart from those you love.

1081
01:13:16,689 --> 01:13:19,438
Marriages rarely survive
if parasites are present.

1082
01:13:19,601 --> 01:13:20,975
If you love your wife...

1083
01:13:21,137 --> 01:13:24,814
... you must destroy any addiction
that has your heart.

1084
01:13:24,977 --> 01:13:28,393
If you don't, it will destroy you.

1085
01:13:52,052 --> 01:13:55,532
Okay, Lord. No more addictions.

1086
01:14:11,830 --> 01:14:13,292
Mr. Rudolph.

1087
01:14:14,775 --> 01:14:16,630
Caleb.

1088
01:14:18,774 --> 01:14:20,149
You doing okay today?

1089
01:14:20,631 --> 01:14:22,770
No, not really.

1090
01:14:38,552 --> 01:14:42,263
Irma, I don't want you
talking to that guy.

1091
01:14:42,425 --> 01:14:44,726
He is weird.

1092
01:14:45,625 --> 01:14:48,375
Takes one to know one.

1093
01:16:24,962 --> 01:16:26,588
What?

1094
01:16:39,236 --> 01:16:40,643
No.

1095
01:16:41,380 --> 01:16:42,657
No.

1096
01:17:20,008 --> 01:17:21,917
- Good morning.
- Hi, Mrs. Evans, how are you?

1097
01:17:22,088 --> 01:17:23,779
I'm fine. I hope you are.

1098
01:17:23,944 --> 01:17:25,155
I'm doing pretty good.

1099
01:17:25,321 --> 01:17:28,801
I actually wanted to talk to you about
the equipment we've been looking at.

1100
01:17:28,969 --> 01:17:32,285
I bet your parents are excited. When
a patient gets the right wheelchair...

1101
01:17:32,456 --> 01:17:34,245
...it can make such a difference.

1102
01:17:34,889 --> 01:17:36,002
I'm sorry, what?

1103
01:17:36,169 --> 01:17:39,431
The bed and wheelchair we delivered
to your parents this morning.

1104
01:17:40,745 --> 01:17:41,793
To my parents?

1105
01:17:41,962 --> 01:17:44,263
Yes, they should have been delivered
by now.

1106
01:17:45,130 --> 01:17:46,953
But I haven't paid for anything yet.

1107
01:17:47,114 --> 01:17:49,056
Oh, it's actually
already been paid for.

1108
01:17:49,610 --> 01:17:51,782
A gentleman called,
said that he wanted to pay...

1109
01:17:51,947 --> 01:17:53,704
...for everything
that you'd picked out.

1110
01:17:53,868 --> 01:17:57,545
Actually, he covered everything
plus some accessories.

1111
01:17:57,708 --> 01:17:59,235
He said...

1112
01:18:00,523 --> 01:18:01,930
Mrs. Holt?

1113
01:18:20,461 --> 01:18:24,106
- Isn't this wonderful?
- Oh, she looks amazing.

1114
01:18:24,270 --> 01:18:26,343
Hi, Mom.

1115
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:47,975
Has anyone ever told you
that you're wonderful?

1116
01:18:48,528 --> 01:18:50,415
Maybe, but not today.

1117
01:18:51,025 --> 01:18:53,196
Gavin, you didn't have to do that.

1118
01:18:53,361 --> 01:18:56,230
- Do what?
- Giving money to help my parents.

1119
01:18:57,297 --> 01:18:58,607
That was so thoughtful.

1120
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:01,510
Thank you.

1121
01:19:01,938 --> 01:19:03,148
You're welcome.

1122
01:19:03,538 --> 01:19:05,545
It was the least I could do.

1123
01:19:09,011 --> 01:19:11,858
- Do you have lunch plans?
- I do now.

1124
01:19:34,260 --> 01:19:35,406
"Dear Catherine.

1125
01:19:35,797 --> 01:19:38,644
I can't tell you how much
I've enjoyed getting to know you.

1126
01:19:39,637 --> 01:19:42,670
I find myself
thinking about you often...

1127
01:19:42,836 --> 01:19:45,871
...and I look forward
to seeing you every day.

1128
01:19:46,646 --> 01:19:48,238
Gavin."

1129
01:19:52,727 --> 01:19:56,524
Yeah, I need to know if there's a Gavin
that works at the hospital.

1130
01:19:57,719 --> 01:20:00,053
No, I just have a first name.

1131
01:20:17,304 --> 01:20:18,646
Dr. Keller?

1132
01:20:19,481 --> 01:20:21,815
- Yes?
- Caleb Holt.

1133
01:20:21,977 --> 01:20:24,017
I need a word with you, please.

1134
01:20:24,185 --> 01:20:26,738
It's really not a good time.
I'm about to make my rounds.

1135
01:20:26,905 --> 01:20:28,945
I think you need to make time.

1136
01:20:29,402 --> 01:20:32,402
This is concerning Catherine,
my wife.

1137
01:20:35,067 --> 01:20:37,205
All right, what can I do for you?

1138
01:20:38,618 --> 01:20:40,626
I know what you're doing.

1139
01:20:41,051 --> 01:20:44,346
I have no intention of stepping aside
as you try to steal my wife's heart.

1140
01:20:45,275 --> 01:20:48,658
I've made some mistakes,
but I still love her.

1141
01:20:49,020 --> 01:20:51,835
So just know
I am going after her too.

1142
01:20:53,147 --> 01:20:57,272
And since I'm married to her,
I'd say I've got a head start.

1143
01:20:59,772 --> 01:21:03,570
By the way,
thanks for helping me with my hand.

1144
01:21:03,870 --> 01:21:06,520
My ring finger's feeling
a whole lot better.

1145
01:21:37,791 --> 01:21:40,956
Y'all, I just saw Caleb and Dr. Keller
going at each other.

1146
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:43,673
He had his fist
all knuckled in his face.

1147
01:21:43,841 --> 01:21:45,696
Are you serious?

1148
01:21:47,169 --> 01:21:49,078
What are you all talking about?

1149
01:21:49,729 --> 01:21:51,518
Hey, Cat, how you doing, girl?

1150
01:21:51,681 --> 01:21:54,616
I'm fine.
You sure got quiet really fast.

1151
01:21:54,785 --> 01:21:56,891
Well, that's because
we decided to stop talking.

1152
01:21:57,058 --> 01:21:58,432
What's up?

1153
01:21:58,594 --> 01:22:00,766
I'm setting up an interview
in about 10 minutes...

1154
01:22:00,930 --> 01:22:04,541
...but I was wondering if you guys
have seen Dr. Keller this morning.

1155
01:22:04,706 --> 01:22:07,129
I think he was doing rounds,
maybe on the 8th Floor.

1156
01:22:07,298 --> 01:22:09,851
Okay, well, I'll see y'all later.

1157
01:22:10,019 --> 01:22:11,710
See you.

1158
01:22:12,836 --> 01:22:14,558
Why didn't you tell her?

1159
01:22:14,722 --> 01:22:17,211
- Because it ain't our business.
- But you told all of us.

1160
01:22:17,380 --> 01:22:21,504
I don't want her to know her business
is our business if it ain't our business.

1161
01:22:25,189 --> 01:22:26,649
Hi.

1162
01:22:27,141 --> 01:22:29,563
Hey, how are you?

1163
01:22:29,733 --> 01:22:32,929
- Hey, Catherine.
- How's the good doctor today?

1164
01:22:33,093 --> 01:22:36,671
- Pretty busy, actually.
- Are we still on for lunch?

1165
01:22:36,965 --> 01:22:39,300
You know, there's a few things
I need to catch up on.

1166
01:22:39,462 --> 01:22:42,112
- I've gotten a little behind lately.
- Okay.

1167
01:22:42,277 --> 01:22:45,093
- Well, maybe we could talk later.
- That'd be good.

1168
01:22:45,254 --> 01:22:48,353
- All right, see you around.
- See you.

1169
01:22:59,592 --> 01:23:02,342
- Hello, Catherine.
- Oh, hi, Anna. How are you?

1170
01:23:02,504 --> 01:23:04,609
I'm doing well. And you?

1171
01:23:04,776 --> 01:23:07,078
I'm okay, I guess.
Do you wanna sit down?

1172
01:23:07,240 --> 01:23:08,931
I'd love to if I'm not disturbing you.

1173
01:23:09,096 --> 01:23:10,656
Not at all.

1174
01:23:12,329 --> 01:23:15,012
So, what's been going on
in your life these days?

1175
01:23:15,177 --> 01:23:17,349
We haven't talked in a while.

1176
01:23:18,666 --> 01:23:21,349
Well, it's been one of those years.

1177
01:23:22,122 --> 01:23:23,879
Good or bad?

1178
01:23:24,618 --> 01:23:28,393
You know, I hate to say it,
but mostly bad.

1179
01:23:30,539 --> 01:23:32,546
You know when you get
to a fork in the road...

1180
01:23:32,715 --> 01:23:35,585
...and you know that either way you go
is gonna change your life?

1181
01:23:36,042 --> 01:23:39,972
Life does give you some of those.
Excuse me just a minute.

1182
01:23:45,996 --> 01:23:48,101
So have you decided
which path to take?

1183
01:23:50,669 --> 01:23:52,327
I think so.

1184
01:23:52,493 --> 01:23:54,827
It's just hard
not to second-guess yourself.

1185
01:23:56,557 --> 01:24:01,544
Pardon me, I don't mean to pry,
but does this concern relationships?

1186
01:24:03,758 --> 01:24:04,773
It does.

1187
01:24:05,389 --> 01:24:07,910
Catherine, you're so young.

1188
01:24:08,078 --> 01:24:10,948
I would encourage you
to make your choices carefully.

1189
01:24:11,470 --> 01:24:13,576
I'm trying to.

1190
01:24:16,271 --> 01:24:18,159
But I'm also tired of feeling empty.

1191
01:24:19,534 --> 01:24:21,924
Anna, it's so nice
to have someone treat you...

1192
01:24:22,096 --> 01:24:24,267
...like they really care about you.

1193
01:24:24,432 --> 01:24:28,939
Forgive me, but you're talking about
a certain young doctor, aren't you?

1194
01:24:30,225 --> 01:24:32,843
I suppose it's no secret
as much as he and I talk.

1195
01:24:33,553 --> 01:24:37,000
I couldn't help but notice
how you act around each other.

1196
01:24:37,169 --> 01:24:40,782
But I also wonder
how your husband would feel.

1197
01:24:44,786 --> 01:24:47,055
My husband has had his chance.

1198
01:24:47,218 --> 01:24:49,291
And Dr. Keller is a good man.

1199
01:24:49,458 --> 01:24:52,774
He treats me better than my husband
has treated me in years.

1200
01:24:52,946 --> 01:24:56,045
He listens to me
and makes me feel important.

1201
01:24:56,211 --> 01:24:58,961
I haven't felt that way
in a very long time.

1202
01:24:59,635 --> 01:25:02,286
It's always good to have that, but...

1203
01:25:02,451 --> 01:25:07,537
But, sweetheart, if this doctor is trying
to woo you while you're still married...

1204
01:25:07,700 --> 01:25:11,562
...what makes you think
he won't do that with someone else?

1205
01:25:12,212 --> 01:25:14,929
I don't wanna talk about this, Anna.
We're getting personal.

1206
01:25:15,092 --> 01:25:16,881
Oh, Catherine, I'm sorry.

1207
01:25:17,044 --> 01:25:18,833
I didn't mean
to overstep my bounds.

1208
01:25:18,997 --> 01:25:21,234
I need to go.
It's good to see you, Anna.

1209
01:29:00,010 --> 01:29:02,181
Catherine, are you okay?

1210
01:29:04,042 --> 01:29:05,416
I'm fine.

1211
01:29:05,898 --> 01:29:08,713
- Aren't you going to work?
- No.

1212
01:29:14,795 --> 01:29:17,697
- Are you sick?
- I'll be fine.

1213
01:29:20,459 --> 01:29:22,053
Is it your allergies?

1214
01:29:23,084 --> 01:29:25,931
I said I'll be fine.
Don't worry about me.

1215
01:29:26,764 --> 01:29:29,578
Because if you need something,
I can go to the store.

1216
01:29:30,349 --> 01:29:32,553
No, I'm okay. You can go.

1217
01:29:36,557 --> 01:29:37,987
Okay.

1218
01:30:05,552 --> 01:30:06,665
Can you sit up for me?

1219
01:30:18,481 --> 01:30:19,463
You got a fever.

1220
01:30:46,996 --> 01:30:48,370
Here.

1221
01:30:49,012 --> 01:30:51,183
You think you can take this?

1222
01:31:07,093 --> 01:31:08,500
Why are you doing this?

1223
01:31:10,966 --> 01:31:15,025
I have learned
you never leave your partner.

1224
01:31:15,287 --> 01:31:17,043
Especially in a fire.

1225
01:31:20,535 --> 01:31:22,641
Caleb, what's happened to you?

1226
01:31:27,031 --> 01:31:28,918
Dad asked me
if there was anything in me...

1227
01:31:29,079 --> 01:31:30,868
...that wanted to save our marriage.

1228
01:31:33,689 --> 01:31:35,663
And then he gave me something.

1229
01:31:38,265 --> 01:31:39,344
I could let you read it.

1230
01:31:47,001 --> 01:31:48,278
Was it this?

1231
01:31:50,329 --> 01:31:52,217
How long have you known?

1232
01:31:53,018 --> 01:31:55,026
I found it yesterday.

1233
01:31:56,314 --> 01:31:57,841
So, what day are you on?

1234
01:31:59,130 --> 01:32:00,789
Forty-three.

1235
01:32:01,787 --> 01:32:03,380
There's only 40.

1236
01:32:06,236 --> 01:32:08,308
Who says I have to stop?

1237
01:32:16,093 --> 01:32:17,653
Caleb...

1238
01:32:18,492 --> 01:32:20,402
...I don't know how to process this.

1239
01:32:22,621 --> 01:32:24,562
This is not normal for you.

1240
01:32:26,877 --> 01:32:28,917
Welcome to the new normal.

1241
01:32:34,813 --> 01:32:37,400
You didn't wanna do this at first,
did you?

1242
01:32:40,286 --> 01:32:41,596
No.

1243
01:32:43,647 --> 01:32:45,719
But halfway through, I realized...

1244
01:32:45,887 --> 01:32:49,051
...that I did not understand
what love was.

1245
01:32:50,271 --> 01:32:55,128
And once I understood that,
I wanted to do it.

1246
01:32:56,063 --> 01:33:00,090
Caleb, I want to believe
that this is real.

1247
01:33:01,440 --> 01:33:04,757
But I am not ready
to say that I trust you again.

1248
01:33:06,784 --> 01:33:08,541
I understand that.

1249
01:33:11,937 --> 01:33:14,872
But whether you ever reach
that point or not...

1250
01:33:16,354 --> 01:33:19,136
...I need you
to understand something.

1251
01:33:38,819 --> 01:33:40,478
I am sorry.

1252
01:33:48,325 --> 01:33:50,113
I have been so selfish.

1253
01:33:54,950 --> 01:33:58,692
For the past seven years,
I have trampled on you...

1254
01:33:58,854 --> 01:34:01,723
...with my words
and with my actions.

1255
01:34:05,639 --> 01:34:10,015
I have loved other things
when I should have loved you.

1256
01:34:15,655 --> 01:34:17,793
In the last few weeks...

1257
01:34:18,599 --> 01:34:23,750
...God has given me a love for you
that I had never had before.

1258
01:34:25,384 --> 01:34:27,773
And I have asked him to forgive me.

1259
01:34:29,608 --> 01:34:34,464
And I am hoping, I am praying...

1260
01:34:36,266 --> 01:34:39,462
...that somehow
you would be able to forgive me too.

1261
01:34:45,866 --> 01:34:51,050
Catherine, I do not want to live
the rest of my life without you.

1262
01:35:02,955 --> 01:35:04,865
I'm supposed to give
those divorce papers...

1263
01:35:05,036 --> 01:35:06,923
...to my lawyer next week.

1264
01:35:09,132 --> 01:35:10,693
I just...

1265
01:35:14,413 --> 01:35:16,356
I need some time...

1266
01:35:17,356 --> 01:35:18,666
...to think.

1267
01:35:22,765 --> 01:35:25,221
You can have all the time you need.

1268
01:35:56,433 --> 01:35:59,084
- Hello, Mrs. Holt, how are you today?
- Fine, thanks.

1269
01:35:59,249 --> 01:36:01,071
I hope your parents are doing well.

1270
01:36:01,233 --> 01:36:03,470
That new bed and wheelchair
are certainly helping.

1271
01:36:03,634 --> 01:36:06,219
I'm so glad.
Well, what can I do for you today?

1272
01:36:06,641 --> 01:36:09,938
I just need to pick up a few linens
for the hospital bed for my mom.

1273
01:36:10,099 --> 01:36:11,822
Sure, we have some in stock.

1274
01:36:11,986 --> 01:36:14,856
Great, that's the only thing
that wasn't covered by the doctor...

1275
01:36:15,027 --> 01:36:17,001
...when he purchased
that bed and wheelchair.

1276
01:36:17,171 --> 01:36:18,381
The doctor?

1277
01:36:18,546 --> 01:36:22,092
Yes, Dr. Keller,
our secret philanthropist.

1278
01:36:23,123 --> 01:36:25,742
I don't think Dr. Keller
covered those things.

1279
01:36:25,908 --> 01:36:27,980
No, I'm sure he did.
I spoke with him about it.

1280
01:36:29,011 --> 01:36:34,413
Mrs. Holt, if I remember correctly,
$24,300 was given...

1281
01:36:34,580 --> 01:36:38,355
...for the bed and wheelchair,
but Dr. Keller was not the main giver.

1282
01:36:39,349 --> 01:36:40,396
What?

1283
01:36:40,565 --> 01:36:43,827
Of the amount given,
Dr. Keller gave $300.

1284
01:36:47,798 --> 01:36:49,292
Then who gave the other?

1285
01:36:50,358 --> 01:36:52,627
Your husband, Caleb.

1286
01:36:54,165 --> 01:36:57,232
He came in about two weeks ago
and paid for everything.

1287
01:36:57,399 --> 01:36:59,058
I assumed you knew.

1288
01:37:00,886 --> 01:37:01,999
Two weeks ago?

1289
01:37:02,167 --> 01:37:07,218
Yes, he told me not to tell anyone,
but I didn't think that included you.

1290
01:37:07,479 --> 01:37:09,651
It was the Tuesday before last.

1291
01:37:09,816 --> 01:37:11,409
He called
and asked what the price...

1292
01:37:11,576 --> 01:37:13,518
...of a particular bed
and wheelchair were.

1293
01:37:13,688 --> 01:37:14,833
And I looked it up and...

1294
01:37:36,218 --> 01:37:38,006
Oh, where is it?

1295
01:38:33,919 --> 01:38:35,862
Oh, stop crying.

1296
01:38:43,328 --> 01:38:46,012
Okay, explain RECEO.

1297
01:38:46,850 --> 01:38:47,832
He ain't gonna get it.

1298
01:38:48,002 --> 01:38:53,272
Rescue, exposure,
containment, extinguish...

1299
01:38:53,442 --> 01:38:55,514
Captain, can I see you for a minute?

1300
01:38:56,130 --> 01:38:58,465
- Right now?
- Yes, sir.

1301
01:39:03,267 --> 01:39:04,892
Something wrong?

1302
01:39:05,314 --> 01:39:07,224
Catherine is in the bay.

1303
01:39:08,259 --> 01:39:10,593
- My Catherine?
- Yes, sir.

1304
01:39:30,789 --> 01:39:31,836
Catherine?

1305
01:39:37,189 --> 01:39:39,611
If I haven't told you...

1306
01:39:41,062 --> 01:39:43,429
...that you are a good man...

1307
01:39:44,582 --> 01:39:45,760
...you are.

1308
01:39:50,695 --> 01:39:53,281
And if I haven't told you...

1309
01:39:54,087 --> 01:39:56,454
...that I've forgiven you...

1310
01:39:56,903 --> 01:39:58,529
...I have.

1311
01:40:08,329 --> 01:40:09,954
And if I haven't told you...

1312
01:40:11,208 --> 01:40:13,511
...that I love you...

1313
01:40:14,025 --> 01:40:15,169
...I do.

1314
01:40:19,018 --> 01:40:22,334
Something has changed in you,
Caleb.

1315
01:40:23,498 --> 01:40:26,597
And I want what happened to you
to happen to me.

1316
01:40:32,555 --> 01:40:34,246
It can.

1317
01:40:35,915 --> 01:40:41,513
Is it too late to ask you
to grow old with me?

1318
01:40:58,445 --> 01:41:00,005
- Yes.
- Hey, what are you looking at?

1319
01:41:00,173 --> 01:41:01,962
Back up.
There ain't nothing to see here.

1320
01:41:02,125 --> 01:41:03,108
Why? What's going on?

1321
01:41:03,278 --> 01:41:05,449
Go back to your business.
Caleb's starting a fire.

1322
01:41:05,613 --> 01:41:07,785
- Why's he starting a...?
- Ain't that kind of fire.

1323
01:41:07,950 --> 01:41:09,510
Go back to your business. Go... Hey.

1324
01:41:09,678 --> 01:41:11,686
Put you on cleanup duty.

1325
01:42:13,236 --> 01:42:15,570
Good morning,
Mr. and Mrs. Rudolph.

1326
01:42:16,180 --> 01:42:17,741
Caleb.

1327
01:42:22,101 --> 01:42:24,688
I don't understand that boy.

1328
01:42:29,718 --> 01:42:32,718
- How are you?
- Hi, son.

1329
01:42:38,358 --> 01:42:40,912
I'm getting to where I know this trail
pretty well.

1330
01:42:41,560 --> 01:42:44,723
- You're welcome to walk it anytime.
- I just might.

1331
01:42:46,136 --> 01:42:48,045
I wanna thank you, Dad.

1332
01:42:48,823 --> 01:42:51,093
The Love Dare changed my life.

1333
01:42:51,256 --> 01:42:52,947
God changed your life.

1334
01:42:53,112 --> 01:42:55,796
The love dare
was just a tool he used.

1335
01:42:56,505 --> 01:42:58,392
I've already given it
to one of my firemen.

1336
01:42:58,552 --> 01:43:01,455
Good. It's meant to be passed on.

1337
01:43:03,097 --> 01:43:06,959
I just can't tell you how grateful I am
that you didn't give up on me, Dad.

1338
01:43:08,057 --> 01:43:10,294
Or on Mom, for that matter.

1339
01:43:14,170 --> 01:43:18,294
Caleb, I wanna be a godly man.

1340
01:43:19,003 --> 01:43:21,370
And I'm learning so much.

1341
01:43:22,458 --> 01:43:24,248
But there's something
I haven't told you.

1342
01:43:27,131 --> 01:43:30,034
I wrote that notebook
in my own handwriting...

1343
01:43:30,364 --> 01:43:32,785
...because I knew
you would accept it from me.

1344
01:43:34,140 --> 01:43:36,790
But I didn't do the love dare
on your mom.

1345
01:43:36,955 --> 01:43:38,898
She did it to me.

1346
01:43:41,628 --> 01:43:43,003
What?

1347
01:43:43,164 --> 01:43:44,725
Son...

1348
01:43:45,341 --> 01:43:47,195
...I was the one
that wanted to leave.

1349
01:43:48,253 --> 01:43:50,076
But God got a hold of your mother...

1350
01:43:51,390 --> 01:43:55,384
...and she prayed and loved me
unconditionally.

1351
01:43:56,222 --> 01:43:59,386
It was through her example
that I came to Christ.

1352
01:44:01,887 --> 01:44:03,413
Mom did this?

1353
01:44:03,902 --> 01:44:05,429
She's such a blessing to me.

1354
01:44:06,015 --> 01:44:08,350
And she's grown so much.

1355
01:44:08,671 --> 01:44:11,093
I love her with all my heart.

1356
01:44:14,271 --> 01:44:15,865
Dad, I...

1357
01:44:17,248 --> 01:44:20,095
I have treated her so wrong.

1358
01:44:20,416 --> 01:44:23,832
Caleb, she deserves your respect.

1359
01:44:50,851 --> 01:44:53,371
Mom. Mom, I'm so sorry.

1360
01:44:54,979 --> 01:44:57,794
Mom, I didn't know. I didn't know.

1361
01:44:57,955 --> 01:45:00,989
It's all right, son.
It's okay. It's all right.

1362
01:45:04,165 --> 01:45:06,074
Mom, please forgive me.

1363
01:45:06,244 --> 01:45:08,251
I do, Caleb. You're forgiven.

1364
01:45:08,420 --> 01:45:10,460
I love you.

1365
01:45:11,333 --> 01:45:13,276
I love you too, Mom.

1366
01:45:13,446 --> 01:45:15,518
I love you so much.

1367
01:45:18,182 --> 01:45:20,548
I love you, Caleb.

1368
01:45:29,287 --> 01:45:32,221
We've gathered here today
to celebrate the reaffirmation of vows...

1369
01:45:32,391 --> 01:45:33,635
...with Caleb and Catherine.

1370
01:45:33,799 --> 01:45:37,028
This may be the second time they've
made a commitment to this marriage...

1371
01:45:37,191 --> 01:45:41,796
...it is the first time they've done so on
a foundation of faith in Jesus Christ.

1372
01:45:41,960 --> 01:45:43,848
"It is the desire
of Caleb and Catherine...

1373
01:45:44,040 --> 01:45:46,495
...to establish their vows
from this point on...

1374
01:45:46,663 --> 01:45:49,250
...as a covenant and not a contract.

1375
01:45:49,417 --> 01:45:52,384
For marriage is a sacred institution
established by God...

1376
01:45:52,553 --> 01:45:55,587
...and one that is meant to last
for life."

1377
01:45:59,753 --> 01:46:02,949
"Caleb, in the presence of God
and these witnesses...

1378
01:46:03,114 --> 01:46:06,213
...do you come today
to freely and unconditionally commit...

1379
01:46:06,378 --> 01:46:08,799
...to this covenant marriage
to Catherine?"

1380
01:46:09,418 --> 01:46:10,880
I do.

1381
01:46:11,435 --> 01:46:15,777
"And, Catherine, do you come today
to freely and unconditionally commit...

1382
01:46:15,947 --> 01:46:18,369
...to this covenant marriage
to Caleb?"

1383
01:46:18,540 --> 01:46:20,034
I do.

1384
01:46:20,203 --> 01:46:21,218
With all my heart.

1385
01:46:22,412 --> 01:46:23,841
Genesis 2:24 says:

1386
01:46:24,012 --> 01:46:26,794
For this reason, a man shall leave
his father and mother...

1387
01:46:26,956 --> 01:46:31,778
...and shall be joined to his wife,
and the two shall become one flesh.
