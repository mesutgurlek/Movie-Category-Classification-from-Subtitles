00:08:07,048 --> 00:08:08,675
we get some of my brother's
loser-ass friends

155
00:08:08,783 --> 00:08:11,445
to go over to Mason's house,
ring his doorbell,

156
00:08:11,553 --> 00:08:14,386
and when he answers,
they're just gonna, bang,

157
00:08:14,489 --> 00:08:16,923
junk punch him
right up in his man business

158
00:08:17,025 --> 00:08:18,185
and then he's gonna keel over.

159
00:08:18,293 --> 00:08:21,262
While he's writhing on the ground
screaming, "Why?"

160
00:08:21,362 --> 00:08:23,455
they'll go, "You know why!"

161
00:08:24,499 --> 00:08:26,899
Wow! Did you just think of that?

162
00:08:27,001 --> 00:08:28,662
No, I was thinking about it a lot
on the way over.

Joy, you're gonna need
to take off this ring.

Where's the one place where
you can step up and be a man?

Where can you go where
you can forget all your troubles

and act like a total idiot?

178

I am talking about one place
and one place only, my friend.

show him a good time.

I want you two to listen to me.

so protracted, so expensive

will ever see a dime of it.

Yeah, he's the judge.
He can do whatever he wants.

And he clearly wants to make an example
out of you both.

If you just do what the guy says,

514

he's gonna be forced
to grant you a divorce.

- You would probably...

to what she has to say. It's just...

668
00:35:01,895 --> 00:35:05,228
In fact, actually,
I carry this notebook around with me,

669

just so I can write it down,
because usually it's so important.

I don't know if I can do this.

Then we go to plan B.

742
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,053
Mother's third marriage
was to this 20-year-old

743
00:39:29,162 --> 00:39:31,960
club-footed Cuban bartender
who came into a ton of money.

744
00:39:32,365 --> 00:39:34,128
The court said
that if they both wanted the money,

745
00:39:34,233 --> 00:39:36,997
they had to remain married and prove
they can make it work. Sound familiar?

746
00:39:37,103 --> 00:39:39,071
Mother wasn't going to see a cent of that,

747
00:39:39,172 --> 00:39:41,402
but then she proved
that he'd been unfaithful,

748
00:39:41,507 --> 00:39:43,532
and the judge ruled in her favor.

749
00:39:43,643 --> 00:39:43,743
And gave her all the money.

750
00:39:43,743 --> 00:39:45,677
And gave her all the money.

751
00:39:46,679 --> 00:39:49,614
See, the judge said that you had to prove

752
00:39:49,716 --> 00:39:51,377
that you were trying
to make the marriage work.

753
00:39:51,484 --> 00:39:53,884
But if we can make it seem like she isn't...

754
00:39:53,987 --> 00:39:55,682
I don't know
why I haven't thought of this before!

755
00:39:55,788 --> 00:39:57,517
- Because you're not a very good lawyer.
- Oh, my God.

756
00:39:57,624 --> 00:40:00,457
There should be a law
against how bad a lawyer I am.

757
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,549
But then again, I wouldn't know about it!

758
00:40:01,661 --> 00:40:04,528
So if I can get Jack to end the marriage
by either leaving me

759
00:40:04,631 --> 00:40:06,963
or cheating on me...

760
00:40:07,066 --> 00:40:08,556
Not only would you get out
of the marriage...

761
00:40:08,668 --> 00:40:12,104
- You will also get the full $3 million.
- Oh, my God.

762
00:40:12,605 --> 00:40:15,267
- I love you! I want to kiss you.

We didn't think you'd ever settle down.

1078
00:56:50,869 --> 00:56:54,930
But then we met this wonderful girl.
You couldn't have done better!

1079
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:56,839
JACK SR: We are very proud of you, Son.

1080
00:56:56,942 --> 00:56:59,376
- Okay. Love biscuit?
- Yes, tinkle monkey?

1081
00:56:59,478 --> 00:57:01,844
Can I speak to you for one second?

1082
00:57:01,947 --> 00:57:03,244
Of course!

1083
00:57:03,348 --> 00:57:05,145
He probably just wants
to give me a big smooch.

1084
00:57:05,250 --> 00:57:06,444
We haven't seen each other all day!

1085
00:57:07,819 --> 00:57:11,414
My God!
How weird is it going to be in court

1086
00:57:11,556 --> 00:57:14,525
when your parents are
character witnesses for me?

1087
00:57:14,626 --> 00:57:16,753
Well, obviously, you haven't
told them everything.

1088
00:57:16,862 --> 00:57:18,989
No, I was waiting for you to do that.

1089
00:57:19,097 --> 00:57:20,724
What if we didn't?

1090
00:57:22,401 --> 00:57:27,202
What would it take for you to just
keep this our little secret for a little bit?

1091
00:57:28,674 --> 00:57:30,733
I want the bathroom door back.

1092
00:57:30,842 --> 00:57:34,107
And I want the toilet seat left the F down.

1093
00:57:34,346 --> 00:57:35,335
No.

1094
00:57:35,647 --> 00:57:37,478
- One time up...
- I got it.

1095
00:57:37,582 --> 00:57:38,810
...and I make the call.

1096
00:57:38,917 --> 00:57:40,077
- Done.
- Okay.

1097
00:57:40,185 --> 00:57:43,552
Well, Jack, Sr., you know, it is just so nice

1098
00:57:43,655 --> 00:57:47,284
to finally meet the man
who has taught Jack everything he knows.

1099
00:57:47,392 --> 00:57:49,417
- I tried.
- JOY: Well, something must've stuck.

1100
00:57:49,528 --> 00:57:51,257
Do you know he made this bar
we're sitting at?

1101
00:57:51,363 --> 00:57:53,729
Isn't it beautiful? I mean, look.

1102
00:57:53,999 --> 00:57:56,160
Dovetail's off on the corner.

1103
00:57:57,335 --> 00:57:58,563
JACK SR: It's off!

1104
00:57:59,671 --> 00:58:01,639
Well, I think it's great.

1105
00:58:02,340 --> 00:58:04,865
I actually think that Jack
could sell his furniture.

1106
00:58:04,976 --> 00:58:07,342
I don't know.
That would require actually finishing it.

1107
00:58:07,446 --> 00:58:09,812
Maybe you should try telling Jack
you don't want him to finish it,

1108
00:58:09,915 --> 00:58:12,383
then maybe he would actually do it.

1109
00:58:12,484 --> 00:58:15,214
(ALL LAUGHING)

1110
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:16,844
What are you doing on Saturday?

1111
00:58:16,955 --> 00:58:19,446
You've got to come to Uncle Pat's
birthday in the park with us.

1112
00:58:19,558 --> 00:58:21,116
I would love to.

1113
00:58:22,194 --> 00:58:23,889
She went after my family!

1114
00:58:23,995 --> 00:58:26,054
Dude, you're letting this chick
get in your head.

1115
00:58:26,164 --> 00:58:27,597
Yeah, I know.

1116
00:58:28,900 --> 00:58:31,460
Now I'm going to figure out
how to get into hers.

1117
00:58:31,570 --> 00:58:33,435
You should never let a chick
get in your head.

1118
00:58:33,538 --> 00:58:36,632
That's why I prefer
not to even talk to my dates.

1119
00:58:41,980 --> 00:58:43,004
Yes!

1120
00:58:44,316 --> 00:58:47,308
Why didn't I think of this before?
If she's going to play dirty, so am I.

1121
00:58:51,757 --> 00:58:54,055
- Hi.
- Hey. Jameson, on the rocks.

1122
00:59:00,332 --> 00:59:02,391
- You're Mason, right?
- Yeah.

1123
00:59:02,667 --> 00:59:05,329
I'm Jack Fuller. I'm a friend of Joy's.

1124
00:59:05,704 --> 00:59:06,671
- Joy's?
- Yeah.

1125
00:59:06,772 --> 00:59:09,263
I just wanted to give you this back.

1126
00:59:10,242 --> 00:59:11,709
She threw it in the trash.

1127
00:59:11,810 --> 00:59:14,404
But, you know, guy code, I couldn't just
let it end up in the trash.

1128
00:59:14,513 --> 00:59:16,572
I mean, you spent, what, like,
five, six thousand on this thing.

1129
00:59:16,681 --> 00:59:18,546
Actually, thirty grand.

1130
00:59:20,285 --> 00:59:21,513
I got it.

1131
00:59:23,021 --> 00:59:24,955
All right. Well, thanks.

1132
00:59:26,491 --> 00:59:27,549
Okay.

1133
00:59:31,930 --> 00:59:33,693
Hey, how's she doing?

1134
00:59:37,102 --> 00:59:38,364
You know, she's good.

1135
00:59:38,470 --> 00:59:40,370
She's probably put on some weight,
though, right?

1136
00:59:40,472 --> 00:59:42,337
From all the emotional eating
due to the break-up?

1137
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:44,567
You really lived up to the billing.
You know that?

1138
00:59:44,676 --> 00:59:47,042
Joy told me
what an impressive guy you are.

1139
00:59:47,145 --> 00:59:48,203
Oh! Yeah.

1140
00:59:48,313 --> 00:59:51,441
She said she was trying to be
so perfect, because

1141
00:59:52,217 --> 00:59:56,620
deep down, she never really felt
like she was good enough to be with you.

1142
00:59:57,222 --> 00:59:59,918
But those insecurities are long gone now.

1143
01:00:00,058 --> 01:00:03,027
She's really come into her own.
She's on fire!

1144
01:00:03,128 --> 01:00:05,858
I'll tell you what, she not gonna be
on the open market for very long.

1145
01:00:05,964 --> 01:00:08,455
- It's a feeding frenzy out there!
- A feeding frenzy, huh? Yeah.

1146
01:00:08,567 --> 01:00:10,501
Well, I gotta get going.

1147
01:00:11,203 --> 01:00:14,400
My Uncle Pat is having a birthday party
tomorrow in Grove Park.

1148
01:00:14,506 --> 01:00:15,598
Joy and I are going.

1149
01:00:15,707 --> 01:00:19,143
Anyway, I gotta go pick up the present
she got for him. Bag of weed!

1150
01:00:19,244 --> 01:00:20,677
- Her idea!
- Really?

1151
01:00:20,812 --> 01:00:22,473
- She's on fire!
- Wow.

1152
01:00:22,581 --> 01:00:23,775
On fire.

1153
01:00:25,650 --> 01:00:27,345
Well, thanks again.

I'm so glad you could make it.
Hey, sweetie.

01:00:46,805 --> 01:00:48,136
- Thanks for calling.
- Where's Jack?

1161
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:51,107
He's over there,
coaching the Little League.

- Hi!
- Hi.

1171
01:01:11,830 --> 01:01:16,199
This is my niece, and BFF,
the great Sammy Sosa.

1172
01:01:16,301 --> 01:01:20,795
Sammy, this is your Aunt Joy.

1173
01:01:20,906 --> 01:01:22,897
- Nice to meet you, Sammy.
- Hi, Joy.

1174
01:01:23,008 --> 01:01:24,635
I didn't know you coached Little League.

1175
01:01:24,743 --> 01:01:27,735
Oh, there's a lot of things you don't know
about me. Isn't that right?

1176
01:01:27,846 --> 01:01:32,374
Jack wore a little fedora
and a leather jacket to school

1177
01:01:32,484 --> 01:01:33,951
every day for six months.

1178

- What, are we bonding now?

1182
01:01:51,536 --> 01:01:53,595
She doesn't seem so bad, Uncle Jack.

1183
01:01:54,072 --> 01:01:57,132
I think you guys should just
split the money and stay married.

1184
01:01:57,442 --> 01:01:59,637
Make a hundred pretty babies.

1185
01:02:01,513 --> 01:02:02,946
You told her?

Yeah, I don't have secrets from Sammy.
I tell her everything.

- What are you talking about?

1216
01:03:41,713 --> 01:03:44,307
- She's a wily temptress.
- "A wily temptress."

01:03:44,416 --> 01:03:45,815
- Yes!
- You just said "wily temptress."

Yes, I did, because that is what she is.

They tempt in a wily fashion.
And then they play you.

1221
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:59,724
Tempt, play, tempt, play.
And she's playing you, my friend.

1222
01:03:59,831 --> 01:04:02,994
Don't let her play you
out of what is rightfully yours.

1223

I just met Chonger's husband.
He's a very smart guy.

1260

He's a tool, but he's smart.

Gotcha. Let's begin.

01:23:05,909 --> 01:23:10,972

Therefore, we propose
the following settlement, Your Honor.

1497
01:23:20,424 --> 01:23:22,790
The original $3 million,
deduct half for taxes

1498
01:23:22,893 --> 01:23:25,623
and $50,000 that's already been spent,

BANGER: Now we come to the final item
on our agenda.

1535
01:25:37,194 --> 01:25:39,162
Congratulations, McNally.

1536
01:25:41,965 --> 01:25:44,525
Thank you, sir. I won't let you down.

1537
01:25:50,507 --> 01:25:53,442
Okay, I think I'm gonna have to
let you down.

1538
01:25:53,543 --> 01:25:56,011
Why don't you just give it to Chong,
you know?

1539
01:25:56,113 --> 01:25:57,512
She's good, she deserves it,

1540
01:25:57,614 --> 01:26:00,082
and besides,
I think she just enjoys being miserable.

1541
01:26:00,517 --> 01:26:02,644
- Yes!
- You sure you know what you're doing?

1542
01:26:02,753 --> 01:26:05,688
No, I don't. But I think that's the point.

1543
01:26:07,023 --> 01:26:09,617
I would rather do nothing and be happy

1544
01:26:10,527 --> 01:26:13,052
than do something that I don't love.

1545
01:26:26,109 --> 01:26:27,906
Well, I lost her at happy.

1546
01:26:28,011 --> 01:26:29,706
I don't know what the hell
she was trying to say anyway.

1547
01:26:29,813 --> 01:26:32,441
Well done, Chonger. The job is yours.

1548
01:26:36,119 --> 01:26:37,381
Thank you.

1549
01:26:38,221 --> 01:26:40,052
So! Jack made a piece of furniture.

1550
01:26:41,091 --> 01:26:42,490
He finished it.

1551
01:26:42,592 --> 01:26:44,219
Okay. Go ahead, Dad.
What's wrong with it?

1552
01:26:44,327 --> 01:26:45,794
Nothing. It's good.

1553
01:26:45,896 --> 01:26:48,160
It's really good. I'm proud of you.

1554
01:26:51,334 --> 01:26:52,528
- Thank you.
- But...

1555
01:26:52,636 --> 01:26:53,603
Here we go.

1556
01:26:53,703 --> 01:26:55,261
...you royally screwed up
when it comes to that girl.

1557
01:26:55,372 --> 01:26:59,138
It was a big, stupid mistake. Okay?
The entire marriage was a lie!

1558
01:26:59,242 --> 01:27:01,767
The marriage might have been a mistake,
but it was not a lie.

1559
01:27:01,878 --> 01:27:04,642
And I think that anybody
who has spent time with you two recently

1560
01:27:04,748 --> 01:27:05,840
could tell you that.

1561
01:27:05,949 --> 01:27:09,077
So why don't you get your head
out of your ass

1562
01:27:09,186 --> 01:27:11,347
and go do something about it?

1563
01:27:11,988 --> 01:27:15,321
Or should I tell you not to,
and then maybe you will?

1564
01:27:18,662 --> 01:27:21,324
- TIPPER: She's gone, man.
- Gone? What do you mean, gone?

1565
01:27:21,431 --> 01:27:25,731
She, like, lost it. She quit her job,
shut off her phone. She took off.

1566
01:27:26,002 --> 01:27:27,993
Look, I don't really care much for you,

1567
01:27:28,104 --> 01:27:29,901
and I want to cut your friend Hater.
Seriously.

1568
01:27:30,006 --> 01:27:31,234
But for some reason,

1569
01:27:31,341 --> 01:27:34,276
you're, like, the only man
that Joy can actually be herself with,

1570
01:27:34,377 --> 01:27:38,313
so I wanna tell you where she is,
I really do. I just don't know.

1571
01:27:38,982 --> 01:27:40,950
- What do you know?
- I don't know. If you were miserable

1572
01:27:41,051 --> 01:27:44,487
and you wanted to get happy again,
where would you go?

1573
01:27:46,289 --> 01:27:47,347
What?

1574
01:27:49,125 --> 01:27:50,422
Thank you.

1575
01:27:53,697 --> 01:27:55,995
Okay, tell you what. We both go.

1576
01:27:56,333 --> 01:27:57,527
That way, when she sees us both,

1577
01:27:57,634 --> 01:28:00,125
she can make up her mind
on who she wants to be with.

1578
01:28:00,237 --> 01:28:04,105
I've loaned you my band saw,
I've loaned you my beer tap.

1579
01:28:04,207 --> 01:28:05,731
Do you even know
how to drive an automatic?

1580
01:28:05,842 --> 01:28:07,503
The keys. Give me the keys.

1581
01:28:07,611 --> 01:28:08,976
Here. Sorry.

1582
01:28:09,779 --> 01:28:12,145

So.

Did you come all the way out here
just to give this back to me?

I did. So I'm going to get out of here.

You bet on me, Joy,

So don't think about anyone else

1615

01:35:50,907 --> 01:35:53,398
<i>I hate you my friend</i>

1688
01:38:14,150 --> 01:38:15,742
(EXHALES)

1689
01:38:15,852 --> 01:38:19,288
What are you doing later? You know,
there's a meteor shower tonight.

1690
01:38:19,388 --> 01:38:20,821
You know what?

1691
01:38:20,923 --> 01:38:23,517
Jack was our glue.

1692
01:38:23,626 --> 01:38:26,026
I feel like the fact that he's gone
makes us a little closer.

1693
01:38:26,129 --> 01:38:28,495
No, it makes us a little bit just...

1694
01:38:29,031 --> 01:38:30,794
The opposite of that.

1695
01:38:39,509 --> 01:38:41,136
You like to party?
