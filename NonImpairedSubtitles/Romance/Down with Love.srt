That's his portrait, there.

[Vikki] Forgive me if we kept you
waiting, but Barbara hit a storm...

60
00:07:18,469 --> 00:07:20,403
on her way down from Maine.

61
00:07:20,471 --> 00:07:23,372
- So you've come down from Maine, huh?
- You remember, C.B.

62
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,375
Miss Novak is
the farmer's daughter librarian...

63
00:07:26,443 --> 00:07:29,139
who spent the long,
cold New England winter...

64
00:07:29,213 --> 00:07:33,047
writing her manuscript
by the light of a lonely oil lamp.

65
00:07:33,117 --> 00:07:34,880
I'm at a loss here, ladies.

66
00:07:34,952 --> 00:07:38,979
I'm afraid I don't know exactly
what Miss Novak's book is about.

67
00:07:39,056 --> 00:07:43,288
Miss Novak's book is a serious work
of nonfiction entitled...

68
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,851
Vikki, excuse me.
It's right behind you.

69
00:07:45,929 --> 00:07:48,796
Would you mind pouring me
a cup of coffee?

70
00:07:50,434 --> 00:07:52,766
It's a serious work of nonfiction...

71
00:07:52,836 --> 00:07:55,202
entitled Down With Love.

72
00:07:55,272 --> 00:07:58,537
- This is empty.
- If you're making a fresh pot,
I'll have a cup.

73
00:07:58,609 --> 00:08:00,509
- Count me in.
- Likewise.

74
00:08:00,577 --> 00:08:02,101
- Ditto.
- None for me, Vikki.

75
00:08:02,179 --> 00:08:05,171
- Thanks, R.J.
- I'll have a Sanka.

76
00:08:08,752 --> 00:08:12,552
As I was saying, the central thesis
of Miss Novak's book, Down With Love...

77
00:08:12,623 --> 00:08:15,421
is that women will never be happy
until they become...

78
00:08:15,492 --> 00:08:20,054
independent as individuals by achieving
equal participation in the workforce.

79
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:23,896
And how do you propose
women do this, Miss Novak?

80
00:08:23,967 --> 00:08:27,300
By saying, "Down with love."

81
00:08:27,371 --> 00:08:29,532
Love is a distraction.

82
00:08:29,606 --> 00:08:32,632
If women were to stop falling in love,
it would mean the end of the human race.

83
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:34,735
Not at all.

84
00:08:34,812 --> 00:08:38,043
I said women should refrain
from love, C. W...

85
00:08:38,115 --> 00:08:40,049
not sex.

86
00:08:40,117 --> 00:08:43,143
Isn't that the same thing?

87
00:08:44,188 --> 00:08:46,782
I mean, for women.

88
00:08:46,857 --> 00:08:50,691
It won't be, after they've mastered the
three levels I've outlined in my book...

89
00:08:50,761 --> 00:08:53,889
that will teach any woman
to live life the way a man does.

90
00:08:53,964 --> 00:08:58,094
Level one instructs women
to abstain from men altogether...

91
00:08:58,168 --> 00:09:02,969
so they'll stop thinking that
the pleasures experienced during
the sex act are related to love.

92
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,668
They're not,
as women will learn...

93
00:09:05,743 --> 00:09:09,235
by practicing the self-pleasuring
technique that I've detailed...

94
00:09:09,313 --> 00:09:13,841
in chapter seven entitled...
"Up With Chocolate. '"

95
00:09:13,917 --> 00:09:16,181
- [Groaning]
- You see, gentlemen...

96
00:09:16,253 --> 00:09:19,654
the female experiences
a biological reaction to chocolate...

97
00:09:19,723 --> 00:09:23,921
that triggers the same
pleasurable responses as are
triggered during the sex act.

98
00:09:23,994 --> 00:09:26,929
By substituting chocolate for sex...

99
00:09:26,997 --> 00:09:30,797
the female will soon learn
the difference between sex and love.

100
00:09:30,868 --> 00:09:34,599
Love for a man will
no longer occupy her mind.

101
00:09:34,671 --> 00:09:38,004
She will now fiind that she has
the time and the energy...

102
00:09:38,075 --> 00:09:40,009
to move on to level two...

103
00:09:40,077 --> 00:09:43,740
where taking on new challenges will lead
to the self-sufficience of level three...

104
00:09:43,814 --> 00:09:46,339
where the woman becomes active
in the workplace...

105
00:09:46,417 --> 00:09:49,818
and earns and achieves
an unequivocal equality...

106
00:09:49,887 --> 00:09:51,821
with men.

107
00:09:55,826 --> 00:09:59,626
And all this time the woman
is abstaining from sex?

108
00:09:59,696 --> 00:10:01,630
Heavens no!

109
00:10:01,698 --> 00:10:05,259
By level three, she can have sex
whenever she likes, without love...

110
00:10:05,335 --> 00:10:09,169
and enjoy it the way a man does...
a la carte.

111
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:17,041
Well, Miss Novak, your theories...

112
00:10:17,114 --> 00:10:19,844
may have worked with
the gentlemen up in Maine...

113
00:10:19,917 --> 00:10:24,877
but the men in Manhattan are not the fiine,
upstanding, straightforward men of Maine.

114
00:10:24,955 --> 00:10:27,856
The men of Manhattan are devious.

115
00:10:27,925 --> 00:10:31,224
They're dangerous. They'll be
coming at you from every angle.

116
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:34,196
While you're watching your front,
they'll attack from the rear.!

117
00:10:34,264 --> 00:10:38,598
And while you're protecting your rear,
they'll drop out of the sky.

118
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:44,171
Adios.

We're good.

156
00:12:53,302 --> 00:12:56,100
Yeah, but some bad Nazis
are good scientists.

157
00:12:56,171 --> 00:13:00,369
The guy building the rocket that'll land on
the moon first and win us the space race?

158
00:13:00,442 --> 00:13:03,411
He's a Nazi, and I saw
the top-secret file to prove it.

159
00:13:03,479 --> 00:13:05,970
Here. I brought you a souvenir.

160
00:13:06,048 --> 00:13:08,380
Whoa!

161
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:13,353
[Gasps] A top-secret NASA
security clearance badge!

162
00:13:13,422 --> 00:13:16,323
- How did you get this?
- Blame it on the bossa nova.

163
00:13:16,391 --> 00:13:18,859
The triplets?

164
00:13:18,927 --> 00:13:20,861
Yeah.

165
00:13:20,929 --> 00:13:24,831
You see, Lola shakes
her maracas...

166
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:27,630
and Rosa bounces her bongos...

167
00:13:27,703 --> 00:13:30,103
while Nina is all hands...

168
00:13:30,172 --> 00:13:33,164
120 words a minute.

169
00:13:33,242 --> 00:13:35,642
The story? It's written?

170
00:13:35,711 --> 00:13:37,702
Whoa! Catch!

171
00:13:37,779 --> 00:13:40,543
But is it safe to print?
NASA's gonna blow its stack.

172
00:13:40,616 --> 00:13:44,814
Well, they forgave Germany.
They can forgive us.

173
00:13:44,887 --> 00:13:48,379
Get someone from Legal up here.

174
00:13:48,457 --> 00:13:50,516
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

175
00:13:50,592 --> 00:13:53,026
Yes, sir. Yes, sir!

176
00:13:53,095 --> 00:13:56,861
My analyst says I only react to you
with such vehement loathing...

177
00:13:56,932 --> 00:13:58,923
because I admire you so much.

178
00:13:59,001 --> 00:14:01,993
He says I resent you
for being a self-made man...

179
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:04,561
as opposed to the son
of a self-made man.

180
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:08,371
Here. Hope you have your garters
from last night. There's none in here.

181
00:14:08,443 --> 00:14:12,675
Garters? I haven't worn garters
since Nixon conceded.

182
00:14:12,748 --> 00:14:15,308
What, are you turning into
some sort of beatnik?

183
00:14:15,384 --> 00:14:18,547
Step into the future.
Garters are a thing of the past.

184
00:14:20,489 --> 00:14:23,253
I don't know, Catch.

185
00:14:23,325 --> 00:14:25,759
I have enough
of an insecurity complex...

186
00:14:25,827 --> 00:14:29,126
without worrying about
my socks falling down.

187
00:14:29,197 --> 00:14:33,759
How can you be confident you won't show
a shiny shin when you cross your legs?

188
00:14:33,835 --> 00:14:35,996
It's a miracle of the space age.

189
00:14:36,071 --> 00:14:41,008
Silk manufacturers are using new wonder
fibers like Lycra, Orlon and Dacron...

190
00:14:41,076 --> 00:14:44,136
to put super stay-up power
into their over-the-calf sock.

191
00:14:44,212 --> 00:14:47,704
[Peter] What would you say is
the average length for most men?

192
00:14:47,783 --> 00:14:49,717
[Catcher]
How would I know?

193
00:14:49,785 --> 00:14:53,448
You think I spend all my time
in the locker room at the club
making a comparative study?

194
00:14:53,522 --> 00:14:55,581
[Peter]
Let me see yours again, then.

195
00:14:55,657 --> 00:14:57,591
We could measure.
I'll get a ruler.

196
00:14:57,659 --> 00:15:00,423
- [Catcher] Better make it a yardstick.
- [Gasps]

197
00:15:00,495 --> 00:15:04,090
Let's be accurate. Make sure
you've got it fully extended.

198
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:06,100
Have it up the whole way.

199
00:15:06,168 --> 00:15:09,137
[Catcher] It stays up all the way
all day long, man.

200
00:15:09,204 --> 00:15:12,833
That's the miracle I was telling you about.
Better living through chemistry.

201
00:15:12,908 --> 00:15:15,240
You got 16 inches.

202
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:17,471
[Peter]
Sixteen inches?

203
00:15:17,546 --> 00:15:19,707
How long does a man's hose
have to be?

204
00:15:19,781 --> 00:15:22,716
[Catcher] That's 32 inches
of confidence in every step.

205
00:15:22,784 --> 00:15:26,015
Don't forget...
I've got two of'em.

206
00:15:30,292 --> 00:15:34,126
I don't believe it. You went through
another one. That's three this month.

207
00:15:34,196 --> 00:15:37,432
What is it about the workplace
that women just can't seem to handle?

208
00:15:37,432 --> 00:15:38,228
What is it about the workplace
that women just can't seem to handle?

209
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:41,030
Men! They want us to fail.

210
00:15:41,103 --> 00:15:43,936
The nerve, inviting me to New York
to launch my book...

211
00:15:44,006 --> 00:15:46,304
when they have no intention
of promoting it!

212
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:48,536
- Don't worry. I have a plan.
- You do?

213
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:52,569
Remember last winter you said you'd like
publicity where men would see it too?

214
00:15:52,648 --> 00:15:54,741
"Perhaps in a men's magazine,"
you said.

215
00:15:54,816 --> 00:15:56,807
"A prestigious men's magazine.

216
00:15:56,885 --> 00:16:00,150
The most widely circulated and
highly respected men's magazine."

217
00:16:00,222 --> 00:16:02,156
- KNOW?
- Yes, you did.

218
00:16:02,224 --> 00:16:05,318
No, I mean KNOW. KNOW magazine,
for men in the know.

219
00:16:05,394 --> 00:16:07,362
Oh, yes. Exactly.

220
00:16:07,429 --> 00:16:11,092
- You got us advertising in KNOW?
- I did better.

221
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:15,933
I got you a cover story written by KNOW
magazine's star journalist Catcher Block.

222
00:16:16,004 --> 00:16:19,496
Catcher Block? The ladies' man,
man's man, man about town?

223
00:16:19,574 --> 00:16:22,372
Oh, Vikki,
you're the best friend...

224
00:16:22,444 --> 00:16:25,880
a girl from Maine who wrote a book
and came to New York could ever have!

225
00:16:25,947 --> 00:16:27,938
You don't know the half of it.

226
00:16:28,016 --> 00:16:31,577
I hear Catcher Block
is gorgeous... and eligible.

227
00:16:32,788 --> 00:16:34,949
Not that that matters to us.

228
00:16:35,023 --> 00:16:36,957
Down with love!

229
00:16:37,025 --> 00:16:41,758
I can't believe it.
Me on the cover of KNOW. KNOW.!

230
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:45,493
- No.
- Catch, please, I promised.
It's one cover story.

231
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:49,230
A girl's never called me in my life,
let alone invited me for a drink.

232
00:16:49,304 --> 00:16:51,295
I think this Vikki really likes me.

233
00:16:51,373 --> 00:16:53,307
I think I might really like her.

234
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:57,175
I'm sure I would if she
really likes me, and she does
because I led her to believe...

235
00:16:57,245 --> 00:16:59,975
that as the owner of KNOW magazine,
I had some pull with my staff.

236
00:17:00,048 --> 00:17:02,881
Then pull your staff with one of
your other writers. I'm not doing it.

237
00:17:02,951 --> 00:17:04,885
No, it can't be anyone else.

238
00:17:04,953 --> 00:17:09,253
The best thing I have to offer
a woman is the same as the best
thing you have to offer... you.

239
00:17:09,324 --> 00:17:12,384
But I'm all tied up, Mac.
I'm using me.

240
00:17:12,461 --> 00:17:14,952
Oh, come on! It'll be fun.

241
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:17,294
- You like fun.
- Fun?

242
00:17:17,365 --> 00:17:21,096
Interviewing a man-hating embittered
New England spinster librarian?

243
00:17:21,169 --> 00:17:22,761
How do you know what she's like?

244
00:17:22,838 --> 00:17:25,466
Who else would write a book
called Down With Love?

245
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:29,601
You don't have to be a Nazi
rocket scientist to figure that out.

246
00:17:29,678 --> 00:17:33,478
Catch, please, please, please, please?

247
00:17:33,582 --> 00:17:36,710
I hope you won't be disappointed.

248
00:17:41,256 --> 00:17:43,190
[Gasps]

249
00:18:04,913 --> 00:18:09,213
Oh, Vikki, it's adorable.

250
00:18:09,284 --> 00:18:12,151
[Phone Ringing]

251
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:15,519
My first New York phone call!

252
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:19,492
It must be KNOW magazine.
No one else has your number.

253
00:18:20,695 --> 00:18:22,754
It must be Catcher Block!

254
00:18:22,831 --> 00:18:24,822
- Oh!
- Oh!

255
00:18:26,835 --> 00:18:29,827
- This is Barbara Novak.
- This is Catcher Block.

256
00:18:29,905 --> 00:18:33,568
Catcher Block.
Catcher Block.

257
00:18:33,642 --> 00:18:36,611
- KNOW magazine.
- Oh, yes, of course.

258
00:18:36,678 --> 00:18:39,511
What can I do for you,
Mr. Block?

259
00:18:39,581 --> 00:18:42,072
I think it's what I can do for you,
Miss Novak.

260
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:44,880
I'd like to invite you to lunch
so we can discuss your book.

261
00:18:44,953 --> 00:18:46,944
That sounds very nice...

262
00:18:47,022 --> 00:18:50,082
but I'll have to check my schedule
to see when I'm available.

263
00:18:50,158 --> 00:18:53,559
We've already ordered. Can you be in
the Mahogany Room in ten minutes?

264
00:18:53,628 --> 00:18:56,222
I'm afraid that will be
impossible, Mr. Block.

265
00:18:56,298 --> 00:18:58,858
- Some other time, then.
- Right.

266
00:18:58,934 --> 00:19:01,732
I'll see you in 15.

267
00:19:01,803 --> 00:19:03,805
[Both Squealing]

268
00:19:03,938 --> 00:19:08,432
Catch, you are the best friend a guy
with 20 diagnosed neuroses ever had.

269
00:19:08,509 --> 00:19:11,501
We've been friends a long time.
I knew you when you only had 12.

270
00:19:11,579 --> 00:19:13,740
This is great!
I'll be right back.

271
00:19:13,815 --> 00:19:16,648
Gotta go put in my shoe lifts.

272
00:19:20,421 --> 00:19:23,254
- Guess who.
- As if I'd need to guess.

273
00:19:23,324 --> 00:19:25,815
- Hmm. Tell me my name.
- Tell me you love me.

274
00:19:25,893 --> 00:19:27,884
Blimey, Catch.
You know I love you.

275
00:19:27,962 --> 00:19:31,693
And I love you too... Gwendolyn.

276
00:19:31,766 --> 00:19:33,757
Oh.

277
00:19:35,937 --> 00:19:38,428
- How long's your layover?
- Never long enough.

278
00:19:38,506 --> 00:19:41,100
There's always time for a matinee.

279
00:20:34,729 --> 00:20:39,189
Well, hello, Peter.
Barbara Novak, Peter MacMannus.

280
00:20:39,267 --> 00:20:41,758
Nice to meet you,
Mr. MacMannus.

281
00:20:41,836 --> 00:20:45,294
- [Vikki] Where's Mr. Block?
- Yes, where's Mr. Block?

282
00:20:45,373 --> 00:20:48,865
I, uh, I don't know. Henri.

283
00:20:48,943 --> 00:20:51,673
- Where is Mr. Block?
- I don't know.

284
00:20:51,746 --> 00:20:54,647
A Mr. Block for you,
Mr. MacMannus?

285
00:20:54,715 --> 00:20:56,683
Ah.

286
00:20:56,751 --> 00:20:58,685
Here he is now.

287
00:21:02,123 --> 00:21:04,114
- Catcher!
- Mac.

288
00:21:04,191 --> 00:21:07,991
- Where are ya?
- Something sprang up. Is she there?

289
00:21:08,062 --> 00:21:11,463
- Yes, she is.
- Let me speak to the spinster.

290
00:21:11,532 --> 00:21:14,695
Mr. Block would like
to speak with you.

291
00:21:18,673 --> 00:21:21,540
- This is Barbara Novak.
- I'm so sorry, Miss Novak.

292
00:21:21,609 --> 00:21:23,543
The darndest thing.

293
00:21:23,611 --> 00:21:26,774
I was waiting for you at the bar,
and a little English foxhound...

294
00:21:26,847 --> 00:21:30,146
walked right in, came up to me
and started nuzzling me.

295
00:21:30,217 --> 00:21:33,209
She seemed so lost, and she didn't
want to go with anyone else...

296
00:21:33,287 --> 00:21:35,448
so I just had to take care of her.

297
00:21:35,523 --> 00:21:38,287
Mr. Block, that is so thoughtful.

298
00:21:38,359 --> 00:21:41,419
I remember reading that the true test
of a man's character...

299
00:21:41,495 --> 00:21:43,986
is how he treats
a defenseless creature.

300
00:21:44,065 --> 00:21:47,694
Tell me, Mr. Block,
how is the little bitch now?

301
00:21:47,768 --> 00:21:50,464
Well, I've got her
all nestled in a box...

302
00:21:50,538 --> 00:21:54,133
but I don't think she'll be content
until I'm holding her.

303
00:21:54,208 --> 00:21:57,006
Miss Novak, could we
rain check until dinner?

304
00:21:57,078 --> 00:21:59,137

Miss Novak, I am so sorry.

- The darndest thing.
- Yes, Mr. Block?

311
00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:32,938
I'm out in the park
with my little French poodle...

312
00:22:33,014 --> 00:22:36,950
and she's just not ready to go in yet,
if you know what I mean.

313
00:22:37,018 --> 00:22:39,748
Oh, I do,
but here's a little advice...

314
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:41,913
from a farm girl to a city boy.

315
00:22:41,989 --> 00:22:45,550
You'll find that if you stick
a little twig in her bottom...

316
00:22:45,626 --> 00:22:48,618
she'll remember why she went out
with you in the first place.

317
00:22:48,696 --> 00:22:50,857
I'll keep that in mind.

It's not like Catch to be late.

No. He usually calls
to cancel right on time.

Oh, Barbara,
I'm sure he'll call.

Okay, once, when I told my mother
it was technically incorrect
to call her son a spinster.

- You said she was a brunette.
- I did not!

She sure didn't sound like a blond
on the telephone.

want to die a spinster?

Too busy?

Kennedy, Khrushchev and Castro weren't
too busy during the Cuban Missile Crisis...

00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,934
to sit down and talk to me...

is too busy.

- [Audience Applauding]

Barbara, I know every woman
bought your book...

00:32:41,486 --> 00:32:45,718
and every man sneaked out and bought it
to find out what their women were reading.

454
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:47,917
- That's when the sales doubled.

[Man] But then they tripled.
How did that happen?

456
00:32:50,495 --> 00:32:54,397
It seems that church groups
in the Bible belt were so zealous...

457
00:32:54,466 --> 00:32:57,560
about being seen burning my book...

00:53:00,163 --> 00:53:03,860
Let's make it 10 and see
if we forget all about dinner.

766
00:53:09,172 --> 00:53:12,141
- [Vikki] Are those your parents?
- No. Those are Catch's parents.

767
00:53:12,208 --> 00:53:15,473
Why do you have a picture
of Catch's parents?

768
00:53:16,512 --> 00:53:19,743
Let's listen to some music.

769
00:53:27,990 --> 00:53:30,823
[Whirring]

770
00:53:33,696 --> 00:53:38,429
[Stereo: "1812 Overture'"

[Continues]

772
00:53:41,838 --> 00:53:44,500
It's all right. It's all right.

773
00:53:44,574 --> 00:53:47,338
[Both]
Ooh!

774
00:53:47,410 --> 00:53:49,605
- [Slingshot Sound]
- Ooh!

775
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:53,714
[Both Gasp]

776
00:53:53,783 --> 00:53:56,616
Ooh!

777
00:53:56,686 --> 00:54:00,713
I can't do this for eight more minutes.
Let's go eat.

778

- ["1812 Overture'"Ends]

779
00:54:07,830 --> 00:54:11,027
- [Catcher] How's that?
- [Barbara] Oh.

780
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:14,160
[Catcher]
You tell me when it's good for you.

781
00:54:14,237 --> 00:54:18,799
Put your hand on it and guide me
till I got it in the right spot.

782
00:54:18,875 --> 00:54:22,675
[Barbara]
Almost. Almost.

783
00:54:22,745 --> 00:54:24,838
Oh, Zip.

784
00:54:24,914 --> 00:54:30,443
I've done this a lot before, of course,
but never with such a powerful instrument.

785
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:35,321
[Barbara Gasps]
That's it.

786
00:54:35,391 --> 00:54:39,418
It's perfectly clear.

787
00:54:42,532 --> 00:54:46,662
Oh, Zip, I've never seen anything
so beautiful...

788
00:54:46,736 --> 00:54:48,897
in all my life.

789
00:54:48,971 --> 00:54:53,408
- Neither have I.
- You're not even looking
through the telescope.

790
00:54:53,476 --> 00:54:55,944
I know.

791
00:55:14,764 --> 00:55:18,029
This chocolate souffle
is delicious, Zip.

792
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:20,796
You've really outdone yourself.

793
00:55:20,870 --> 00:55:24,067
- I wanted the perfect end
to the perfect evening.
- Mm.

794
00:55:24,140 --> 00:55:27,507
I've never been more ready
to go to bed.

795
00:55:27,577 --> 00:55:32,173
Oh, Zip, I'm so glad
that you feel that way.

796
00:55:32,248 --> 00:55:36,548
- You know that I feel the same way?
- Well, then, let's get to bed.

797
00:55:36,619 --> 00:55:40,453
- [Inhales Deeply]
- I'll call you a taxi.

798
00:55:42,325 --> 00:55:46,193
- Taxi?
- [Dial Tone]

799
00:55:46,262 --> 00:55:52,132
Oh, when I said bed,
you thought I meant bed.

800
00:55:52,201 --> 00:55:55,136
Oh, Barbara, I'm so sorry.

801
00:55:55,204 --> 00:55:58,173
This is only the first time you've ever
been to my home, and where I come from...

802
00:55:58,241 --> 00:56:02,075
It's all right, Zip.

803
00:56:02,144 --> 00:56:06,581
It's all right.
Um, it's better this way.

804
00:56:08,217 --> 00:56:12,586
Let's, um...
Let's just say good night...

805
00:56:14,490 --> 00:56:16,856
and good-bye.

806
00:56:16,926 --> 00:56:20,293
- Good-bye? You mean for good?
- I'm afraid so, Zip.

807
00:56:20,363 --> 00:56:23,264
You see,
I'm beginning to feel...

808
00:56:23,332 --> 00:56:26,267
Well, I'm beginning to feel.

809
00:56:26,335 --> 00:56:30,169
Well, couldn't you give me
just one more chance?

810
00:56:30,239 --> 00:56:34,232
Oh, I'd like to, Zip,
really, I would...

811
00:56:34,310 --> 00:56:37,279
but just the fact that I'd like to
give you another chance...

812
00:56:37,346 --> 00:56:41,510
is the very reason
why I absolutely must not.

813
00:57:14,183 --> 00:57:17,209
Okay. One more chance.

814
00:57:20,222 --> 00:57:24,625
[Clears Throat]
I'll just, um...

815
00:57:24,694 --> 00:57:27,390
Hmm.

816
00:58:00,863 --> 00:58:04,128
[Laughter, Chattering]

817
00:58:11,707 --> 00:58:14,642
[Chattering Continues]

818
00:58:35,297 --> 00:58:38,425
- Peter?
- You rang?

819
00:58:38,501 --> 00:58:41,470
No. I used my key, Maynard.
How did everyone else get in here?

820
00:58:41,537 --> 00:58:44,973
I took Vikki down to the Village
for a demitasse. Crazy!

821
00:58:45,041 --> 00:58:48,738
And then the coffeehouse got raided,
so I moved the scene uptown.

822
00:58:48,811 --> 00:58:52,645
- You dig, Daddy-O?
- Oh, I do dig.

823
00:58:52,715 --> 00:58:58,017
And after being grounded for 24 days,
this astronaut is ready to blast off.

824
00:59:03,459 --> 00:59:07,088
- Ask me why I mourn.
- Why do you mourn, baby?

825
00:59:07,163 --> 00:59:10,223
I mourn because you are shrouded
in the suit and tie...

826
00:59:10,299 --> 00:59:12,995
that Madison Avenue
will bury you in alive.

827
00:59:13,069 --> 00:59:17,028
Well, if it'll cheer you up,
you can help me out of it.

828
00:59:30,886 --> 00:59:32,085
- Hi!
- Hi! Coffee?

829
00:59:32,085 --> 00:59:34,781
- Hi!
- Hi! Coffee?

830
00:59:34,854 --> 00:59:38,221
So, this is a beatnik party.

831
00:59:38,291 --> 00:59:40,691
- Isn't it a gas?
- Yes!

832
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:44,696
Oh, I'm so glad you called.
After the date I had tonight, I
really didn't want to be alone.

833
00:59:44,764 --> 00:59:47,995
Well, you won't need an astronaut to
find a date here. Everyone's in orbit.

834
00:59:48,067 --> 00:59:52,401
So, should I introduce myself to
the host, or is that too Establishment?

835
00:59:52,472 --> 00:59:55,202
You know the host.
This is Peter's place.

836
00:59:55,274 --> 00:59:58,368
- Catcher Block's
not going to be here, is he?
- Oh, not to worry.

837
00:59:58,444 --> 01:00:00,969
Everyone here is a total stranger.

838
01:00:01,047 --> 01:00:04,073
Go throw your coat on the bed,
and let's join the bash!

839
01:00:12,225 --> 01:00:14,693
Oh, excuse me.

840
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:17,320
- Catch.
- Yes?

841
01:00:19,065 --> 01:00:21,090
Zip?

842
01:00:21,167 --> 01:00:25,331
[Catcher]
Barbara. Barbara, wait.

843
01:00:25,404 --> 01:00:28,430
- Barbara!
- [Elevator Bell Dings]

844
01:00:28,508 --> 01:00:32,911
- Barbara, wait! I can explain.
- You don't have to explain.

845
01:00:32,979 --> 01:00:37,279
You said you were ready for bed.
I'm glad you ran into someone
to take to bed with you.

846
01:00:37,350 --> 01:00:41,116
- But it wasn't like that.
I don't even know her.
- Oh, really!

847
01:00:41,187 --> 01:00:43,519
I mean, I didn't know
what I was doin'.

848
01:00:43,589 --> 01:00:47,047
And yet her hat's off
to you anyway!

849
01:00:47,126 --> 01:00:49,390
What?

850
01:00:59,539 --> 01:01:02,804
- Good night, miss.
- [Bell Dings]

851
01:01:04,177 --> 01:01:06,611
Good night, Major Martin.

852
01:01:06,679 --> 01:01:09,648
Barbara, you gotta believe me.
I did not know what was happening.

853
01:01:09,715 --> 01:01:13,811
The minute I got here, that girl
filled my pipe with some tobacco
she bought in San Francisco.

854
01:01:13,886 --> 01:01:16,753
After that,
everything went hoo-whee!

855
01:01:16,822 --> 01:01:20,781
- You mean she drugged you?
- All the way into that bedroom.

856
01:01:20,860 --> 01:01:24,455
Wait a minute. What were you doing
at a party like that?

857
01:01:24,530 --> 01:01:27,829
I had no idea there was
gonna be a party here.

858
01:01:27,900 --> 01:01:32,132
I got a call after you left to tell me
to come to this publisher's apartment...

859
01:01:32,205 --> 01:01:36,505
to meet some journalist
who wanted to do a cover story
on my NASA top-secret project.

860
01:01:36,576 --> 01:01:41,172
- Some guy named Snitch or Snatch.
- Catch? Catcher Block?

861
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:45,581
Maybe. Anyway, I rush over here,
and that guy does not even show up.

862
01:01:45,651 --> 01:01:49,417
- Don't you see? You were set up.
- No!

863
01:01:49,488 --> 01:01:52,787
Yes! Catcher Block
invited you here...

864
01:01:52,858 --> 01:01:56,794
under false pretenses so he could
do one of his famous exposes...

865
01:01:56,862 --> 01:02:00,559
on how NASA's
top-secret New York project...

866
01:02:00,633 --> 01:02:03,898
is just one big,
drug-infested beatnik shindig.

867
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:06,939
- Oh, that's low!
- That's Catcher Block!

868
01:02:07,006 --> 01:02:11,466
- That's how he operates.!
- Oh, Barbara, I'm so sorry.

869
01:02:11,544 --> 01:02:16,072
I just feel like such
"a" easily tricked hick...

870
01:02:16,148 --> 01:02:20,847
and then you went
and made the trick seem so obvious.

871
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:25,983
Oh, Zip, I didn't mean
to make you feel bad.

872
01:02:26,058 --> 01:02:29,619
I didn't mean
to make you feel mad.

873
01:02:29,695 --> 01:02:32,789
Oh, this is terrible.

874
01:02:32,865 --> 01:02:36,733
We're behaving just like
two people in love.

875
01:02:38,537 --> 01:02:41,199
Which means this argument was
the final straw. This has to be the end.

876
01:02:41,274 --> 01:02:43,834
Or just the beginning.
Holy cow.

877
01:02:43,909 --> 01:02:48,846
This argument has made me realize
that I must really care about you.

878
01:02:48,914 --> 01:02:52,145
I'm finally ready
to get to know you better.

879
01:02:52,218 --> 01:02:54,413
How much better?

880
01:02:54,487 --> 01:02:56,887
All the way better.

881
01:02:56,956 --> 01:03:00,915
- Really?
- I'm sorry I have to say this, Barbara...

882
01:03:00,993 --> 01:03:05,555
but... I love you.

883
01:03:05,631 --> 01:03:09,727
Well, I don't have any rules...

884
01:03:09,802 --> 01:03:11,861
against men falling in love.

885
01:03:11,937 --> 01:03:15,429
So I can make love to you...

886
01:03:15,508 --> 01:03:20,377
heartfelt, passionate,
worshipping, adoring love...

887
01:03:20,446 --> 01:03:23,176
and you could still have
meaningless sex with me, right?

888
01:03:23,249 --> 01:03:25,683
Yes.

889
01:03:25,751 --> 01:03:28,914
So are we still on
for tomorrow night?

890
01:03:28,988 --> 01:03:31,218
Yes.

891
01:03:31,290 --> 01:03:34,225
Oh, yes.
[Sighs]

892
01:03:36,696 --> 01:03:39,927
That pink book is ruining my life.!

893
01:03:39,999 --> 01:03:42,866
Woman acts as if
she has a mind of her own.

894
01:03:42,935 --> 01:03:45,062
She refuses my advances.

895
01:03:45,137 --> 01:03:48,106
This goes straight to the sanctity
of a man's most fundamental right.

896
01:03:48,174 --> 01:03:50,199
All our wives
are giving us trouble.

897
01:03:50,276 --> 01:03:53,245
I'm not talking about my wife.
I'm talking about my mistress.

898
01:03:54,380 --> 01:03:57,372
I want that Vikki Hiller fired!

899
01:03:57,450 --> 01:04:01,409
But you can't fire her now, T.B.

900
01:04:01,487 --> 01:04:04,650
How would it look?

901
01:04:04,724 --> 01:04:07,591
She is the most celebrated editor
in the business.

902
01:04:07,660 --> 01:04:09,594
You're my creative team.

903
01:04:09,662 --> 01:04:12,153
Create a reason to get rid of her...

904
01:04:12,231 --> 01:04:15,064
or I'll create a new creative team.

905
01:04:17,536 --> 01:04:21,529
- [Door Slams]
- [Elevator Bell Dings]

906
01:04:21,607 --> 01:04:26,067
- [Receptionist Talking, Indistinct]
- Good morning, gentlemen.

907
01:04:26,145 --> 01:04:28,079
Do you know why it's good?

908
01:04:28,147 --> 01:04:31,639
Because this is the morning
I tell Theodore Banner that
my fellow senior editors...

909
01:04:31,717 --> 01:04:35,175
are going to treat me like more
than just a titular senior editor...

910
01:04:35,254 --> 01:04:38,690
or I quit.
[Sighs]

911
01:04:45,998 --> 01:04:49,559
I should've known
the top dog would be a rat.

912
01:04:49,635 --> 01:04:52,195
He's a man. I hate men.

913
01:04:52,271 --> 01:04:56,105
For as man-crazy as I've been

I'm sorry, but I don't wanna be
a Down With Love girl anymore.

be Mrs. Peter MacMannus.

your resignation now...

to make too.

925
01:05:34,580 --> 01:05:38,414
I'm not a Down With Love girl either.
I'm a woman who's fallen in love.

And tonight's the night.

could tell she really meant no.

like you, has a meeting there with you...

doesn't know I really am.

Tonight's the night?

I have to have my big night
with Vikki...

940
01:06:22,127 --> 01:06:24,357
the same time you're having
your big night with Novak...

941
01:06:24,430 --> 01:06:27,456
that will ruin Novak and Vikki
and everything Vikki's ever worked for.

942
01:06:27,533 --> 01:06:31,094
You're putting me under
an enormous amount of pressure,

to get the attention of a New York
publisher as well as KNOW magazine...

to meet, you would get distracted...

1045
01:16:16,551 --> 01:16:19,384
by one of your many girlfriends
and stand me up...

1046
01:16:19,454 --> 01:16:22,082
and this would give me a reason
to fight with you over the phone...

and declare that I wouldn't meet
with you for a hundred years.

1048
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:29,594
And then all I would have to do
was be patient and wait...

1049

for everyone in the world...

to buy a copy of my best-seller...

1051

the publicity I would need for you...

1052
01:16:38,072 --> 01:16:42,065
to, one, see what I look like, and, two, see
me denounce you in public...

get even by writing one of your exposes.

1055
01:16:48,683 --> 01:16:51,208
And in order to do that,
you would have to go undercover...

01:16:51,286 --> 01:16:54,483
assume a false identity
and pretend to be the kind of man...

I was pretending to be fall in love.

Since I was pretending to be a girl
who would have sex on the first date...

1059
01:17:01,763 --> 01:17:05,529
you would have to pretend to be a man
who wouldn't have sex for several dates.

take me back to your place...

was someone else's...

But saying "I love you"
was also my plan.

1067

the truth so that when you
heard me say, "I love you"...

1202
01:28:02,422 --> 01:28:04,822
The only man who could have his way
with me now is Milton Hershey.

1203
01:28:04,891 --> 01:28:08,657
Boy, am I glad it fiinally occurred to you
that you were a multimillionaire...

1204
01:28:08,728 --> 01:28:12,994
many times over and we could
start our own business.

1205
01:28:13,066 --> 01:28:17,400
And to think I came that close to
getting married and giving all this up.

1206
01:28:17,470 --> 01:28:20,997
I was really starting
to believe that women weren't
cut out for the workplace...

1207
01:28:21,074 --> 01:28:24,202
when the only problem was
the workplace wasn't cut out for women.

1208
01:28:24,277 --> 01:28:26,711
Banner House bastards.

1209
01:28:26,780 --> 01:28:30,079
The word is out that Novak/Hiller
International is cut to order.

1210
01:28:30,150 --> 01:28:35,588
Girls are lined up around the block to
apply for the job as my private secretary.

1211
01:28:35,655 --> 01:28:40,592
And that's not all. Catcher Block
is here. He wants to see you.

1212
01:28:40,660 --> 01:28:44,426
[Sighs] Well, call the guard,
because I don't wanna see him.

1213
01:28:44,497 --> 01:28:49,025
- You have to see him. He's an applicant.
- Ooh.

1214
01:28:49,102 --> 01:28:52,765
- For heaven's sake.
- At the risk of sounding like my mother...

1215
01:28:52,839 --> 01:28:57,572
just stay perfectly still
and let him get it over with.

1216
01:28:57,644 --> 01:29:00,374
- [Intercom Beeps]
- Mrs. Litzer.

1217
01:29:00,447 --> 01:29:02,642
Send in the first applicant,
please.

1218
01:29:02,716 --> 01:29:07,449
Okay, "Novick."
Over and out.

1219
01:29:26,539 --> 01:29:31,602
Another ruse, Catcher? You know
I have no interest in seeing you.

1220
01:29:31,678 --> 01:29:34,704
But you know you have to.
And you know I know you have to.

1221
01:29:34,781 --> 01:29:37,306
I'm sure you know how things are
at KNOWever since your new Now.

1222
01:29:37,384 --> 01:29:40,148
I have no way of knowing
how things are now at KNOW.

1223
01:29:40,220 --> 01:29:42,620
I knew how things were
at KNOW before now.

1224
01:29:42,689 --> 01:29:45,055
Then you should know now at KNOW
things are a lot like they are at Now.

1225
01:29:45,125 --> 01:29:48,424
We have to interview every applicant
for every job, and so do you...

1226
01:29:48,495 --> 01:29:51,191
or you'd be going against
Now's definition of discrimination...

1227
01:29:51,264 --> 01:29:54,131
and you wouldn't want the readers
of Now or KNOWto know that,
now, would you?

1228
01:29:55,268 --> 01:29:58,931
Have a seat, Mr. Block.

1229
01:29:59,005 --> 01:30:02,600
- [Clears Throat]
- Your application?

1230
01:30:06,980 --> 01:30:09,778
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm. Oh, dear.

1231
01:30:09,849 --> 01:30:14,980
Unfortunately, the secretaryjob doesn't
quite pay as much as your currentjob...

1232
01:30:15,055 --> 01:30:18,115
so I guess that's that.

1233
01:30:18,191 --> 01:30:22,594
Good-bye, Mr. Block.
Oh, have a candy bar for your trouble.

1234
01:30:22,727 --> 01:30:25,787
And thanks again
for thinking of us.

1235
01:30:25,863 --> 01:30:28,161
But I'm always thinking of you,
Miss Novak.

1236
01:30:28,232 --> 01:30:30,928
I can't stop thinking of you.

1237
01:30:31,002 --> 01:30:33,869
And I'd like you
to reconsider considering me.

1238
01:30:33,938 --> 01:30:37,738
- Even at a pay cut of 96.6%?
- It's only money.

1239
01:30:37,809 --> 01:30:39,970
Besides,
I've been on top for so long...

1240
01:30:40,044 --> 01:30:42,979
I thought it might be nice
to try a new position.

1241
01:30:43,047 --> 01:30:45,811
And you think you could be comfortable
in a position under a woman?

1242
01:30:45,883 --> 01:30:49,444
I look forward to it.

1243
01:30:49,520 --> 01:30:51,454
Starting at the bottom...

1244
01:30:51,522 --> 01:30:54,923
working my way up slowly
to the top.

1245
01:30:58,630 --> 01:31:03,761
Still, I'm afraid
that a man of your experience...

1246
01:31:03,835 --> 01:31:07,202
would be too distracted working
in a predominantly female workplace.

1247
01:31:07,271 --> 01:31:12,834
Not at all. You see, I'm not really
interested in women a la carte anymore.

1248
01:31:12,910 --> 01:31:16,073
The next time I get involved with
a woman, it'll be to settle down.

1249
01:31:19,150 --> 01:31:24,213
Well, I wouldn't want you stealing one
of the women from my workforce...

1250
01:31:24,288 --> 01:31:26,779
just to put her away
in a house in the suburbs.

1251
01:31:26,858 --> 01:31:31,124
Oh, I wouldn't want that either.
I'm what you might call a new man.

1252
01:31:31,195 --> 01:31:34,062
Oh, is that so?

1253
01:31:34,132 --> 01:31:37,295
And I'm looking
for a new kind of love.

1254
01:31:45,843 --> 01:31:48,107
"Catcher Block Exposed"?

1255
01:31:48,179 --> 01:31:52,809
"How Falling in Love with Barbara Novak
Made Me a New Man. '"

1256
01:31:52,884 --> 01:31:54,818
Oh, sure.

1257
01:31:54,886 --> 01:31:56,820
And to put yourself on top...

1258
01:31:56,888 --> 01:31:59,584
you just happened to have had
to expose me as Nancy Brown...

1259
01:31:59,657 --> 01:32:01,818
in your attempt
to win a Nobel prize.

1260
01:32:01,893 --> 01:32:05,420
I never said a word
about Nancy Brown.

1261
01:32:05,496 --> 01:32:08,090
And the only prize
I wanted to win was you.

1262
01:32:08,166 --> 01:32:12,660
Crazy, isn't it? After all our tricking
each other, all our game playing...

1263
01:32:12,737 --> 01:32:15,331
I'm the one who wound up here
with the love letter...

1264
01:32:15,406 --> 01:32:18,170
and you're the one
with the scoop.

1265
01:32:18,242 --> 01:32:21,507
Still, I'll keep my eye
on the billboards...

1266
01:32:21,579 --> 01:32:24,173
and maybe one day
you'll do a piece...

1267
01:32:24,248 --> 01:32:27,843
on how you became someone in between
the bashful, brunette Nancy Brown...

1268
01:32:27,919 --> 01:32:31,013
and the cool, blond
Barbara Novak.

1269
01:32:31,089 --> 01:32:34,923
That's a piece
I could really go for.

1270
01:32:43,601 --> 01:32:46,468
[Chattering]

1271
01:32:49,907 --> 01:32:54,867
One, two, three...

01:32:54,946 --> 01:32:59,007
four, five.

1273

- [Elevator Bell Dings]
- Hmm.

1274
01:33:21,906 --> 01:33:25,842
Someone between a blond
and a brunette?

1275
01:33:28,479 --> 01:33:31,744
- [All Gasping]
- Scooped you again.

1276
01:33:39,524 --> 01:33:43,426
I knew you would.

1277
01:33:43,494 --> 01:33:48,090
I knew the minute I placed an ad
as an equal-opportunity employer...

1278
01:33:48,166 --> 01:33:51,567
you would be the first to apply.

1279
01:33:53,738 --> 01:33:58,937
And I knew you knew and you'd
let me in to ask you to marry me.

1280
01:34:02,747 --> 01:34:06,239
But you didn't know I'd say yes.

1281
01:34:14,258 --> 01:34:17,921
- Vegas?
- We can get married there on the spot.

1282
01:34:17,995 --> 01:34:21,158
- I'm not letting you
get away again... ever.
- Oh, Catch.

1283
01:34:21,232 --> 01:34:25,430
- I love you, Barbara.
- I know.

1284

- [Both Phones Ring Simultaneously]
- [Groans]

1285

[Both]
I'm sorry. You'll have to hold.

1286
01:35:21,791 --> 01:35:23,725
- Peter?
- Vikki?

1287
01:35:23,793 --> 01:35:27,229
[Both] Do you wanna marry me or not?
I'm not giving up my career.

1288
01:35:27,297 --> 01:35:30,494
[Both] I wouldn't ask you to.
Then it's a deal?

1289
01:35:30,566 --> 01:35:34,161
- Deal! [Sighs]
- Deal!

1290
01:35:34,237 --> 01:35:37,695
Well, ladies and gentlemen,
it's official.

1291
01:35:37,774 --> 01:35:41,232
The battle of the sexes is over.
What's that?

1292
01:35:41,311 --> 01:35:43,506
Don't believe me?
Well, here's the proof.

1293
01:35:43,579 --> 01:35:47,606
Please give a warm welcome
to the coauthors
of the new book, Here's to Love...

Mrs. Barbara Novak-Block
and Mr. Catcher Block.

1295
01:35:51,621 --> 01:35:56,854
Barbara, I'd like
to propose a toast

1296
01:35:56,926 --> 01:36:00,327
To the topic I dig the most

1297
01:36:00,396 --> 01:36:03,763
Catch, let me dust off
my lovin' cup

Hey, bartender, fill 'er up

Look how the neon
starts to flicker

Love's like a shot
but works much quicker

1301
01:36:15,611 --> 01:36:19,206
And you're a man
who can hold his liquor

[Both]
Cheers, here's to love

1303

I'm an old-fashioned
and you're the cherry

1304

I've got a thirst that's legendary

1305

That's why I fired your secretary

- But now it's only you for dinner
- Breakfast.

1311
01:36:52,582 --> 01:36:57,349
- And lunch.
- I hear the march
that's calling for us

1312
01:36:57,420 --> 01:37:01,049
We'll walk down the aisle
to an angels' chorus

1313
01:37:01,124 --> 01:37:05,458
I'll be your Rock
if you'll be my Doris

Sweet heavens above

1315
01:37:09,132 --> 01:37:12,329
Why is the waiter smiling at us

1316
01:37:12,402 --> 01:37:15,530
He knows what we're thinking of

1317
01:37:15,605 --> 01:37:18,836
- Oh, can the tears
- [Both] Cheers

Baby, here's to love

You've got the lips
to wet my whistle

If that doesn't get ya
maybe this'll
