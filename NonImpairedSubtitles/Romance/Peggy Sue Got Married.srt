1
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,672
<i>Here, Charlie. More fortune cookies.</i>

2
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,512
<i>- Good luck!</i>
<i>- Thanks! What?</i>

3
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:39,230
<i>Next week, we'll be selling</i>
<i>Sanyo remote control VCRs for $299!</i>

4
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,788
- Look, it's Dad!
<i>- Oh, no! I'll go broke!</i>

5
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,028
<i>To give away Mitsubishi</i>
<i>giant-screen television sets for $1,299!</i>

6
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,792
<i>Oh, no!</i>

7
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,908
<i>We won't be undersold on microwaves,</i>
<i>videorecorders, ovens...</i>

8
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:57,277
- Mom, you're not looking.
- Please turn that off.

9
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,155
Mom, when are you going to stop
being mad at Dad?

10
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,674
I mean, how do you think
that makes me feel?

11
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,752
I have certain unresolved feelings
about your father.

12
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,519
I don't trust him.

13
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,437
- And I hate those commercials.
- All right, forget it.

14
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,590
We don't have time
for another heart-to-heart.

15
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,352
Come on. You have to get dressed.

16
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:22,356
- I want you to understand it's insulting...
- Watch your hair.

17
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,278
...for him to go from me to that bimbo.
Do you think he really loves Janet?

18
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,270
Maybe he's just smashed
too many fortune cookies!

19
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,238
Mom, give me a break!
He's missing the reunion because of you.

20
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,038
You know he's dying to go.

21
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,280
At least we won't both have
a miserable time.

22
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,119
Let me see.

23
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,158
What do you think?

24
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,271
You are a very hip chick!

25
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,917
God, you look like you've stepped
right out of <i>Life</i> magazine!

26
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,235
I don't know.

27
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,788
What if nobody else there
is dressed like this?

28
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,915
So?

29
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,392
- I don't think I wanna go.
- Mom.

30
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,995
Everybody's just gonna say,
"Well, hey, where's Crazy Charlie?"

31
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,320
Lots of people are separated and divorced.

32
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,950
Not from the guy
with the lowest prices in town.

33
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,954
I feel ridiculous in this dress!
I'd like to change.

34
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,110
Why are you so nervous?
What's the matter?

35
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,350
Reunions do funny things
to people at this age.

36
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,590
- Hi, Peggy Sue! Beth!
- Hi.

37
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,789
Hi, Maddy.

38
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,389
How are you?

39
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,436
You two look
just like that soap commercial.

40
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,751
- "Which one's the mother?"
- "And which one's the daughter?"

41
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:32,550
You took this seriously.
You're a real blast from the past!

42
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,638
It was Beth's idea.

43
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:38,036
I wish I had the nerve. And the figure.

44
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,953
- Hi.
- Hi! Peggy Sue Bodell?

45
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,076
- All right.
- Mom?

46
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,312
Beth's boyfriend is with the band.

47
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,391
- Must run in the family.
- What does?

48
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:50,631
You and your mother.
You both seem to fall for musicians.

49
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,159
Mom, look!

50
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,354
Oh, God!

51
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:08,631
It's okay. Come on. Look!

52
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,793
Why don't you find a table?
We'll see you in a little while.

53
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,869
Sure.

54
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,592
God, Mom, that picture's great!
Come on, let's get a table.

55
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,192
- Is this good?
- Fine.

56
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,113
- I'll be right back. You be all right?
- Sure.

57
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,272
<i>Thank you. We're gonna do</i>
<i>a little medley for you now.</i>

58
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,115
- Come on, pose like your picture.
- What?

59
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,271
Hi, do you like it?

60
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,909
I figured as everyone has a gold Rolex,
I'd have one made in platinum.

61
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,560
- What a wonderful idea!
- How are you?

62
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,790
I'm fine. How many children do you have?

63
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,235
- I don't have any.
- You don't? I thought you did.

64
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,436
- No. How many do you have?
- I have four.

65
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,669
- Four?
- Four, yeah.

66
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,034
I'm so happy for you.

67
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,156
- I love them so much.
- How's Peggy Sue doing?

68
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,151
She was a mess,
right after they separated.

69
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,198
But I think she's coming out of it.
Seems to be friendly now.

70
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,474
I'm so glad.

71
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,231
Sometimes it's easier when you hate them.

72
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,672
- How about a little dance, princess?
- Walter!

73
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,716
- How are you?
- Good.

74
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,680
- Nice to see you. I'll see you later.
- Yeah.

75
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,636
Aren't you Peggy Sue Kelcher?

76
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:38,475
I was once. Richard Norvik?

77
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,192
I didn't recognise you!

78
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:45,158
You look terrific.
You look exactly the same.

79
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:48,073
I feel ridiculous!
I only did this for tonight, you know.

80
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,071
- It's adorable.
- Thank you.

81
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,879
Peggy Sue Kelcher, this is my wife, Sharon.

82
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,669
- How nice to meet you. Why don't you sit?
- Thank you.

83
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,479
But call me Peggy. Peggy Bodell now.

84
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,270
So, where's Charlie?

85
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,191
I was in town about a year ago
and I turn on the television...

86
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,033
...and I see Crazy Charlie.

87
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,437
It really made me laugh.

88
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,270
Charlie won't be here tonight.

89
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,911
- We're getting divorced, actually.
- I'm sorry to hear that.

90
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,879
Mr. Norvik!

91
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,679
Richard. Doug Snell, Merrill Lynch.

92
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,514
I read about that Codex deal
in <i>Business Week.</i> Congratulations!

93
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,076
Thank you very much.

94
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:39,393
Peggy, how are you? How's Charlie?
Hey, Terry!

95
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,154
- Thank you, Doug, thank you very much.
- Call me.

96
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,756
Madeline Hutton and Arthur Nagle
were high school sweethearts.

97
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,037
Married right after graduation,
they're still together.

98
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:54,274
Maddy. Arthur. How does it feel
to have missed the sexual revolution?

99
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,955
What? What kind of question is that?

100
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,838
That doesn't have anything to do
with the reunion, Delores!

101
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,148
Take it easy, kitten.

102
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:06,756
- Welcome to the singles scene.
- I don't know how you do it.

103
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,908
I've never even dated anybody but Charlie.

104
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,312
It's not that bad, really.

105
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,439
You just have to think of men like houses,
and trade upward.

106
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:23,073
I always thought that you and Charlie
had a really great marriage.

107
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,079
I think we did.

108
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,752
We just got married too young...

109
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,310
...and ended up blaming each other
for all the things we missed.

110
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,354
So he started having affairs
and you started getting depressed?

111
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,518
You just should have left here years ago,
like I did.

112
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,239
It's not so bad.

113
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,110
I've got two great kids.
I've got my own business.

114
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:52,033
Still, if I knew then what I know now...

115
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,635
...l'd do a lot of things differently.

116
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,879
Your damn computers
put me out of business.

117
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,115
You're right. He's drunk.

118
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,509
You're a billionaire
and I'm a goddamn failure.

119
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,037
No, the bakery's doing very well.

120
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,112
- Do you manage it?
- I own it.

121
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,352
I remember that dress.

122
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,433
Rosalie?

123
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:19,237
Oh, no. I remember that locket, too.

124
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,673
You were so excited!
I think you showed it to the whole school.

125
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,318
You have an incredible memory.

126
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:28,358
- It's beautiful. Does it open?
- Yes.

127
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:33,117
- These are my children.
- They're so cute!

128
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,236
Of course, they're not babies anymore!

129
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:38,039
But you were married
when you were three, right?

130
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,352
God bless you!

131
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,630
The best thing about being a dentist.

132
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,758
Pure pharmaceutical grade.

133
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,232
A couple of lines of this,
I could drill my own teeth.

134
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,155
Hi.

135
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,069
Hi.

136
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:12,117
- Who's the guy with the eyes?
- Michael Fitzsimmons.

137
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,909
I used to have
such a crush on him in school.

138
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,672
- Peggy.
- Hi!

139
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,075
God, that Walter Getz can still dance!

140
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:24,228
Your first boyfriend!
Come on, tell me. Any sparks left?

141
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,719
Well, who knows?

142
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,792
I mean, remember,
whatever Walter wants...

143
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,916
...Walter gets!

144
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,792
I'm sorry. Sharon Norvik.

145
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:40,352
This is Carol Heath and Maddy Nagle,
my oldest and my dearest friends.

146
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,829
- Nice to meet you.
- Sharon is married to Richard.

147
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,478
- Lucky lady!
- Thank you.

148
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,869
Michael Fitzsimmons. Is he here?

149
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,358
No. No, I asked Rosalie.
She couldn't track him down.

150
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:53,273
- That's too bad.
- He must have been quite a guy.

151
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,270
Yeah.

152
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:59,273
You know, he is the only boy in high school
I wish I'd gone to bed with!

153
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,634
Only one?

154
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,750
Well, besides Charlie.

155
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,231
I hope the sales of your book go very well.

156
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,390
Anything anecdotal
you'd like to leave us with?

157
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,516
Yeah, every dog has its day.

158
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,749
Meaning what?

159
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:20,992
Peggy, would you please rescue Richard?
Ask him to dance.

160
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,674
Richard. Would you like to dance?

161
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,228
Of course I would.
So, are we through now?

162
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,435
- No.
- Good.

163
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,750
From snivelling runt
to pompous ass in 25 years.

164
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,558
That's quite an accomplishment.

165
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,510
I really cannot get over this.

166
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:45,429
The only time people like Delores Dodge
used to pay any attention to me...

167
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,398
...was to laugh at me or insult me.

168
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,311
- You know that guy Doug Snell?
- Yeah.

169
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,789
He shook my hand
when we walked in here?

170
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,996
He used to call me, "Four-eyed worm."

171
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,072
You showed them all.

172
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,833
You're rich and famous and successful...

173
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,156
...and you have a beautiful wife.

174
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,915
You were always friendly to me.
I appreciated that.

175
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,718
It's Crazy Charlie, the appliance king!

176
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,712
Hey, Charlie!

177
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,592
Look at you! You're putting on
a little weight, man!

178
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,796
You look great. Great.

179
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,672
So, this is the reunion? It's wonderful.

180
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,988
Like, wonderful!

181
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:50,152
Are you and Peggy still talking?
I mean, is it amicable?

182
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,356
She hasn't changed at all, Charlie.

183
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:55,512
- Your daughter's a real doll.
- "Why, I oughta<i>...</i>"

184
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,669
<i>Hello.</i>

185
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,272
Hello!

186
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:29,198
<i>Can I have your attention, please?</i>
<i>Listen up! Can I have your attention?</i>

187
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,874
<i>I know everybody's having a great time...</i>

188
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,198
<i>... but now, you have to get ready for</i>
<i>that moment you've all been waiting for.</i>

189
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,392
Dad? Hi.

190
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,395
<i>The Reunion Committee has selected</i>
<i>a king and a queen.</i>

191
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,233
<i>Let's get back to business.</i>

192
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:00,312
<i>The Reunion Committee</i>
<i>has given this a lot of thought...</i>

193
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:04,439
<i>... and decided on two people</i>
<i>who best represent the spirit...</i>

194
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:07,353
<i>... of Buchanan High's Class of '60!</i>

195
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,519
What are you doing?

196
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,592
<i>The king is someone who,</i>
<i>in more ways than one...</i>

197
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,638
<i>... has come a long way since he left here...</i>

198
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,871
<i>... and we are especially proud</i>
<i>to welcome him back.</i>

199
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,033
<i>Richard Norvik!</i>
<i>Come on up here, King Richard!</i>

200
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,756
I demand a recount!

201
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,433
<i>That's gotta be Getz!</i>

202
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,516
<i>First you gotta learn how to count.</i>

203
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,190
Hold me back!

204
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,636
<i>Well, I just want to say thank you.</i>

205
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:01,751
<i>Sharon and I feel real welcome.</i>
<i>We're having a great time.</i>

206
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,119
<i>Boy, our high school</i>
<i>looks really good from up here.</i>

207
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:09,113
<i>And I just wanna say, it's good to be back.</i>
<i>Thanks a lot.</i>

208
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:20,115
<i>- Now, every king deserves a queen.</i>
- Over here!

209
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,312
<i>Not you, Getz!</i>

210
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,279
<i>Life of the party!</i>

211
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,031
<i>But when we sent out the invitations...</i>

212
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,237
<i>... we didn't mention anything about</i>
<i>this being a costume party...</i>

213
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,958
<i>... and perhaps we should've...</i>

214
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,838
<i>... because just looking at her</i>
<i>brings it all back!</i>

215
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,559
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>I give you our queen...</i>

216
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:41,758
<i>... Peggy Sue Kelcher Bodell!</i>
<i>Come on up here, Peggy Sue!</i>

217
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,550
I can't. I can't do it.

218
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,113
Yes, you can.

219
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:50,757
Go on, you can do it. Go on.
You can do it.

220
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,839
Congratulations.

221
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,555
<i>Thank you, thank you very much.</i>

222
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,189
Mom!

223
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,550
Now, hold your arm up.

224
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,711
Would you like your Twinkie now?

225
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,709
Charlie?

226
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,031
I want to suck your blood!

227
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,476
I also want to suck your Twinkie!

228
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:06,191
- Am I dead?
- No. You are the undead.

229
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,035
Let's have it. You hate them, anyway.

230
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,358
Young man! You stop that!

231
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:18,399
Hey, I just made a deposit in your bank.
Now I want to make a withdrawal.

232
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,755
I think it's time for your next class.

233
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:24,795
- Go on! All of you!
- I'm a little worried about the side effects.

234
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,476
Now, you lie back down.

235
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,199
What am I doing here?

236
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,352
You passed out for a minute, that's all.
Nothing to worry about.

237
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:40,877
- But how did I get here?
- Why don't you let your friends help you?

238
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,516
Take her into the washroom
and splash some cold water on her face...

239
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,319
...and that should perk her up.
- Yes, ma'am.

240
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,879
How are you doing?

241
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,672
Blood drive? 1960?

242
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:01,909
Wanna smoke?

243
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,389
No, Carol. That's the worst thing for her.

244
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,198
I gave them up years ago.

245
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,194
- Where is it?
- Where's what?

246
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,430
Maddy, what did you do to your hair?

247
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,316
I'm taking you back to the nurse.

248
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:27,270
- Delores, why aren't you giving blood?
- I can't. I'm too anaemic.

249
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,555
Maybe you should drink
some of that nail polish.

250
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,755
It might give you strength.

251
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:33,149
Why don't you come back
and show me how?

252
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,278
We're going to take you home now.

253
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:45,352
That's okay.
I'm sure I can remember the way.

254
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,353
Steady now.

255
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,958
People get weak when they give blood.

256
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,591
<i>It's wonderful Spring Radio.</i>

257
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:25,958
<i>At 1280 on your AM dial,</i>
<i>here's more from our golden survey.</i>

258
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,076
<i>And now from The Champs,</i>
<i>let's party with a little</i> Tequila.

259
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,395
- I'll call you later.
- Yes! Let's keep in touch.

260
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,479
Who is it?

261
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:41,113
Peggy. Peggy Sue.

262
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,473
Come on in. I left the door open for you.

263
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,994
The nurse called
and said you'd be coming home.

264
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,513
I have a note.

265
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:09,314
- How do you feel?
- I was excused.

266
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,593
Why don't you go upstairs
and lie down for a while?

267
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,917
Oh, Mom!

268
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:21,508
Chanel No. 5.
It always reminds me of home.

269
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,034
Of course, dear. You're home now.

270
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,755
- You sure you're going to be all right?
- Yeah.

271
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,991
What is going on?

272
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,589
Nancy?

273
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,551
It's Nancy!

274
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,715
My baby sister!

275
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,514
- I'm so happy to see you!
- What are you doing?

276
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:51,430
Mom said you were sick.
You're never happy to see me.

277
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,478
I'm sorry! I'm sorry about that.

278
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,151
I want us to be closer.

279
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,477
I have too many unresolved relationships
in my life.

280
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,998
Teenagers are weird.
And you're the weirdest.

281
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,470
You wanna play a game?

282
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,993
Come here.

283
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,160
How about Monopoly?

284
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:19,791
Or Parcheesi. Or Chutes and Ladders?

285
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,915
<i>I have a question.</i>
<i>Let me turn the tables on you.</i>

286
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,479
<i>Maybe you, down here, don't know.</i>

287
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:28,235
<i>Is there anybody in the house knows</i>
<i>where Dion and the Belmonts are?</i>

288
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:32,518
I don't believe it.
Look at that man. He never ages.

289
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,796
Isn't Kenny Rossi dreamy?

290
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:38,756
I wish he'd break up with Arlene.
She thinks she's so great.

291
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,757
- Don't eat any of the red ones.
- Why not?

292
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:47,834
They're bad for you.
They give you red lips.

293
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,314
What the hell? I'm probably dead anyway.

294
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:15,751
Peggy Sue, get in here!
Dion's almost over.

295
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,515
I left your laundry on your beds, girls.
Don't forget to put it away, okay?

296
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,828
What's for dinner?

297
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,990
Creamed chipped beef on toast
with rutabagas.

298
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,798
Your father's favourite.

299
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,996
Not again!

300
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:39,159
Evelyn! Girls?
What is this out on the street?

301
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,830
Come and take a look!
Who left this out here?

302
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,832
- What is it, dear?
- Come on out and see for yourself!

303
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,273
Don't yell. Stop shouting.

304
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,073
It's cool!

305
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,435
- Dad!
- Wait until I tell Diane.

306
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,080
She's always bragging
about her dad's Cadillac.

307
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,912
What do you think, Peggy Sue?

308
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,994
Oh, Dad! You were always doing
stuff like that! It's funny.

309
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:11,552
It's really funny. You bought an Edsel.

310
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,035
Young lady, what's the matter with you?

311
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,154
Are you drunk?

312
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:23,716
Just a little. I had a tough day.

313
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,435
No, don't wear it out, Nancy!

314
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,551
We can't afford a new car.
Do we have to take it back?

315
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,550
I fail to see the humour of this!
Go to your room, you're grounded!

316
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:40,234
- Grounded?
- Put that down!

317
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:43,433
That's the story of my life! I'm an adult.

318
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:46,074
I'm going to go to Liverpool
and discover The Beatles.

319
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,993
Jack, take it easy!
She gave blood at school today.

320
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:52,993
- She's a little lightheaded.
- This is not giving blood! This is drunk!

321
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,838
Dad, I never knew you had
a sense of humour.

322
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,599
- Evelyn, put her to bed!
- Come on, Mom!

323
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,915
You're making a mountain
out of a molehill.

324
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,513
A tempest in a teapot!

325
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,038
My little baby.

326
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,311
Don't try to grow up so fast.

327
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,789
Mom, I forgot you were ever this young.

328
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,279
Sleep, baby.

329
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,035
Good morning.

330
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:52,432
What happened to your hair, Peggy?
You have such a pretty face.

331
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,871
- Why are you always trying to cover it up?
- I forgot.

332
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,998
- 'Morning.
- 'Morning.

333
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,789
Excuse me.

334
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:02,838
Nancy, put your homework down
and sit down.

335
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,670
You're looking bright and chipper
this morning.

336
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:10,070
I'm still here.
I thought I might as well enjoy myself.

337
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,151
I think I'll go to school today.

338
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:15,917
You know, Dad, I'm sorry about yesterday.

339
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,316
The Edsel is a classic.
Use it in the best of health.

340
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,719
Well, thank you.

341
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:24,753
But don't ever let anything
like that happen again.

342
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:27,957
You're far too young
to start acquiring bad habits.

343
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,430
I agree. You know, Mom and Dad...

344
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:34,710
...you are the best parents
a girl could ever have.

345
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,915
I'm really gonna try and behave myself.

346
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,679
Sure you will!

347
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,598
Come on, Momma, sit down.

348
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,033
You want me to sit?

349
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:50,149
I mean, isn't this great?
Just all of us here together!

350
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,788
Can I tell Charlie
Peggy Sue got drunk last night?

351
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,995
Young lady!

352
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,112
I forgot about him. What am I gonna do?

353
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,874
- Did you two have a fight?
- Sort of.

354
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,757
- About what?
- House payments.

355
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,949
Baby!

356
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,439
How do you feel?

357
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,753
Pretty strange.

358
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:21,113
Come on. Get in. I can take care of that.

359
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,639
I have a headache.

360
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,078
Headache?

361
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,478
You drive like a maniac!

362
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,271
It's not that I'm glad you were sick...

363
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:46,114
...but it just gave me a chance
to do some thinking last night.

364
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:50,512
- Yeah?
- Yeah. About what we said on Tuesday.

365
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,316
I think it makes a lot of sense.

366
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,437
- Refresh my memory.
- How could you forget?

367
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:00,951
We talk about seeing other people
and you forget.

368
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:05,109
I must have blocked it out.

369
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,430
Yeah. I guess I can understand that.

370
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:15,270
But, please, don't start crying again.

371
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,918
It's not gonna be forever.

372
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:32,279
I figure three years is long enough
for the music to pan out, which it will.

373
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,919
I know it.

374
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:36,793
So right after graduation we should...

375
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:40,031
...one: Start to see other people
so that we can...

376
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,880
...two: We can comparison-shop.

377
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,910
And then, three:
Settle down and get married.

378
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:52,518
Why wait? Why not break up now?

379
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:57,793
Because we got the prom coming up
and all these parties.

380
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:01,715
- We don't want to upset our parents.
- They'll learn to live with it.

381
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,229
Peggy Sue!

382
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:41,312
Peggy Sue, come here.

383
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,229
Peggy Sue.

384
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,552
Did you study for the test?

385
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:02,315
- Test? There's a test?
- Yeah.

386
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,196
All right, class. Time's up.

387
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:26,314
And what's the meaning of this,
Peggy Sue?

388
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,997
Mr. Snelgrove...

389
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:33,228
...I happen to know that in the future
I will have no use for algebra.

390
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,117
And I speak from experience.

391
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,912
- Who said that?
- I'm sorry.

392
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:40,989
Sit down!

393
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:45,312
The result of his struggle is
that Santiago comes back with honour.

394
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,789
Santiago comes back with nothing!

395
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,037
There's no meat on the bone.

396
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:52,793
It's Hemingway's ego
trying to defend itself again.

397
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,075
Trying to prove he can still perform.

398
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:58,709
What Hemingway's saying, Michael,
is that we are alone.

399
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:01,439
That when we go out too far,
we're vulnerable.

400
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:05,110
The irony that Santiago
is beaten by the sharks...

401
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,676
...doesn't make him less of a hero.

402
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:10,189
Who is the victim and who is the predator?

403
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,870
We'll finish this discussion next week.

404
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,873
And don't forget, first four chapters
of <i>The Great Gatsby</i> by Monday.

405
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,759
Hope you enjoy it.

406
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,753
Why does your father take inventory
on Sunday nights?

407
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:33,989
Hi, Peggy.

408
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:37,311
It's poker night.
You always got out of it before.

409
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:40,949
I just gotta string him along for a while.
It's for his own good.

410
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:44,350
You're not going into his business.
When are you gonna tell him?

411
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,350
Soon.

412
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:49,436
Walter!

413
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,715
I can't tell everybody everything
all at once.

414
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,553
Strange rumours
are sweeping the school about you.

415
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,959
Hi, Peggy.

416
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,155
What do you mean?

417
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:01,631
- I hear you gave it to old Smellygrove.
- I was there! She told him off to his face!

418
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:02,869
Attagirl, Peg!

419
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,712
Arthur, please don't call me Peg.

420
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,313
"Why, I oughta<i>...</i>"

421
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,035
I don't get it.

422
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:12,509
That's 'cause you're not
a total moron like they are.

423
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,397
It's a stupid movie thing they started.

424
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,391
That's enough outta you, little lady!

425
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,913
"Why, I oughta<i>...</i>"

426
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,273
I'll be right back.

427
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,678
Hi, Richard.

428
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:36,031
I wanted to congratulate you
on winning the math contest.

429
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:38,232
It really wasn't that difficult.

430
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:41,630
What are you doing?
You fishing for four-eyed worms?

431
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,356
Get lost, you macho schmuck!

432
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:51,437
I wanted to talk to you.
It's really important.

433
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:54,554
I'm not doing any tutoring this year.
I'm too busy.

434
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,596
No, it's not about that.

435
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:59,308
Would you meet me after school, please?

436
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:05,558
All right. I'll be in the physics lab.

437
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:11,393
Make it 4:30.
I have to go to a Rocket Club meeting.

438
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,310
Sure.

439
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,832
She's not wasting any time.

440
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:23,635
- Peggy Sue and Mr. Square Root.
- He's a nice guy. He's writing a book.

441
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:26,753
A book? Excuse me for a second.

442
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,958
Why is she punishing herself?

443
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:54,589
Come on, Peggy Sue. Try it again.
You haven't been practising.

444
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:55,829
Sorry.

445
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:58,718
What a girl, what a twirl.
Peg "Leggy" Sue Kelcher.

446
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,712
A brief but glorious career as a majorette.

447
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,110
Baby!

448
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,398
Looking good out there!

449
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,595
Thanks.

450
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,595
I love it when you twirl your baton.

451
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:25,311
I noticed you were giving me
the silent treatment at lunch.

452
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,158
I guess I deserved it.

453
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:30,794
I've been thinking
about my three-year plan.

454
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:34,708
I think it's totally unworkable.
I must have been delirious.

455
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:38,235
I don't know.
I thought it made some sense.

456
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:41,995
Well, in the abstract, maybe.
Get a good grip on yourself.

457
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,391
When I think about you going out
with other guys, I feel<i>...</i>

458
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:52,751
Rejected? Worthless? Miserable?

459
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,915
Yeah.

460
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,515
Good.

461
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,234
Boy, that's some kite!

462
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,829
I'm writing a book on kite construction.

463
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,356
So what do you wanna talk about?

464
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,516
I just wanted to ask you a question.

465
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:35,720
Do you think time travel is possible?

466
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:41,277
- Are you doing a science project?
- Sort of.

467
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:46,312
Well, that's a very interesting question.

468
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,114
Well, now, let's see.

469
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:51,510
If we look at this
in a Newtonian framework...

470
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:54,833
...the possibilities of time travel
were limited.

471
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:59,079
With the advent of the relativity theory,
that's Einstein's relativity theory...

472
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:02,152
...the idea of absolute time
cannot be reasonably affirmed.

473
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,034
Well, then we have Richard's <i>burrito.</i>

474
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,270
What's that?

475
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:11,591
That's my own theory,
based on a Mexican food called the <i>burrito.</i>

476
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:15,435
- I had one at Disneyland.
- I know what a <i>burrito</i> is!

477
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:19,478
You see, I think that time is like a <i>burrito...</i>

478
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:23,397
...in the sense that one part of itself
will fold over...

479
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:26,313
...and it will just touch the other part.

480
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:29,877
- What's inside?
- You can fill it with whatever you want.

481
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:34,431
You can fill it with memories,
with experiences, trigonometry. Anything.

482
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:39,310
Then you think
that time travel is possible for people?

483
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,630
Yes, it is. It is possible.

484
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:46,717
It's absolutely possible for people,
dogs, elephants, cancan girls.

485
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:49,039
Then I'm not crazy!

486
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,830
I really don't know if you're crazy.

487
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,351
I know most people think I am.

488
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,553
- Come here, Richard.
- What?

489
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,358
- Come on.
- What are you doing?

490
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,192
Wait a minute, what are you<i>...</i>

491
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:08,356
Now, I want to tell you something.
You have to promise not to tell anyone!

492
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:11,910
- Okay. I won't.
- No, I'm serious. No one else can know.

493
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,119
I won't.
I promise, I'm not gonna tell anybody.

494
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:21,072
I have come here from the future,
from 25 years ahead.

495
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:25,436
I think that you're probably crazy.

496
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:31,113
I don't have time for this.
I don't have time for jokes.

497
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,760
- I know what you people think about me.
- No!

498
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,273
And I don't appreciate it!

499
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:38,394
You're just the smartest guy I knew to ask.

500
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,360
I know it sounds unbelievable,
but I can prove it.

501
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,472
Well, proof is an excellent concept. How?

502
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,958
You have a blind grandfather.

503
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:51,032
You're gonna invent this machine
that reads books for the blind.

504
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:54,430
You're gonna invent a lot of things.
You're gonna be really famous.

505
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:56,192
Wait a minute.

506
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,157
How did you know about my grandfather?

507
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:01,310
Because I'm telling you the truth.

508
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,795
I read about your invention in a magazine.

509
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,390
I know a lot of things
that are gonna happen.

510
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:09,790
There's gonna be test-tube babies
and heart transplants.

511
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,668
An American...

512
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:16,157
...named Neil Armstrong
will be the first man to walk on the moon.

513
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,999
July 20, 1969.

514
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:24,350
1969?

515
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,556
That's six years ahead of schedule.

516
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:35,075
I would be very careful about this
if I were you.

517
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:37,435
What if you fall into the hands
of some madman...

518
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:41,433
...with plans to manipulate your brain?
- Well, that's why I was getting a divorce.

519
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,431
You know what I really think happened?

520
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,988
I think I had a heart attack
at the reunion and died.

521
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,550
- You look great for a corpse.
- I'm serious.

522
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:51,359
- You're giving me the creeps.
- Well, am I dead or not?

523
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,317
There's one way to find out.

524
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,913
- Give me this.
- What are you doing?

525
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,639
Confucians say, "If you want a way out,
go through a door."

526
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:01,190
There's a fire truck.
If you're dead, it'll pass right through you.

527
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,113
Now just stay there. You're dead.

528
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,315
Young lady!

529
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,833
No, I don't wanna die!

530
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,999
It's all right.

531
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,752
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

532
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:21,715
I had it made into a cocktail ring, though.

533
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,109
This is good.

534
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:27,358
Well, there's not a whole heck
of a lot here.

535
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,396
- Very nice pieces.
- So, thank you.

536
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:32,677
I'll take them to the shop
and have the appraisal ready next week.

537
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:35,228
- Good day, Mrs. Kelcher.
- Good-bye.

538
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:39,070
- Who was that man?
- That was nobody, Peggy.

539
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,911
I'm voting for the Democrats this year.

540
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,309
You know how your father feels
about Democrats.

541
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:50,473
That was a polltaker.
I wouldn't mention it, if I were you.

542
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,957
How was school today, darling?

543
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,918
It was nice to see everybody again.

544
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,073
I don't know.
Everything they teach is so useless.

545
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:01,720
And the lunch! God, that was the worst!

546
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,279
Get that, Peggy.

547
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:13,034
- Hello?
<i>- Peggy Sue? This is Grandma.</i>

548
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:15,231
- Grandma?
<i>- How's my little girl been?</i>

549
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:18,074
<i>- Grandpa and I are very concerned.</i>
- What's the matter?

550
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,195
What's up?

551
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:23,910
- It's Grandma. I can't talk. I'm sorry.
<i>- What's wrong?</i>

552
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:29,275
Mom, I'll call you back. It's Peggy.

553
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:32,199
It's okay. I'll call you back.

554
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,551
Peggy Sue, what is it?

555
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:37,757
What happened to you just now?
What is this all about?

556
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:40,351
I dreamed that Grandma died.

557
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:43,910
Oh, baby. No wonder you're so upset.

558
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:48,348
She's getting on, it's true, but she's fine.

559
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,830
I told her
you weren't feeling well yesterday.

560
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,990
She called to find out how you are.

561
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:57,159
I love her so much
and I haven't seen her in so long.

562
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:01,199
- Grandpa Barney, is he all right?
- He's perfectly fine.

563
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:04,590
You saw them at Easter.
What's this all about, Peggy?

564
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:08,032
I don't know. I forgot.

565
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:14,037
- I'll call her tomorrow. I'll apologise.
- Good girl. I hate to see you so upset.

566
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,232
You're my angel.

567
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:21,278
Peggy, I don't mean to be intrusive.

568
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:27,230
But are you having problems with Charlie?
You mentioned something this morning.

569
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:30,028
A lot of things are confusing right now.

570
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,799
Charlie's just one of them.

571
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:35,873
Is Charlie pressuring you to do things
you don't think you should be doing?

572
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:37,313
What do you mean?

573
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,671
Peggy, you know what a penis is.

574
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,319
Stay away from it.

575
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:56,719
You're the best.

576
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,190
Make her love me, okay?

577
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:01,836
Feed me. Charge me.

578
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,319
Go get her, tiger.

579
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:15,869
Get the door, Jack!

580
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:18,272
Just a moment!

581
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,274
Hello, Charlie.

582
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:26,157
- Hello, Mr. Kelcher.
- Come on in.

583
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,800
- How are things at the hat store?
- Very good.

584
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:31,030
Charlie, could I have a word with you?

585
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:33,156
- Something wrong, sir?
- No, not a thing.

586
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,032
I'd just like to talk to you.

587
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:36,833
Hi, Mrs. Kelcher!

588
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:38,956
- How do you do today?
- Good.

589
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:41,429
- You look wonderful. Snap, crackle, pop.
- They're delicious.

590
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,152
Sit down, Charlie.

591
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:48,190
Nancy.

592
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:50,919
That sounded really great, Nancy.

593
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:53,596
Charlie, you may have noticed that...

594
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:56,638
...Peggy Sue has been acting
a little bit strange lately?

595
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,711
- Indeed.
- She's distorted!

596
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:00,879
Nancy, please.

597
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:06,070
She seems to be
a little bit nervous and confused.

598
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:12,029
Over-emotional and even a little bit
irresponsible at times.

599
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:17,636
Of course, her mother says,
"That's the way girls act sometimes."

600
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:20,075
She's almost a juvenile delinquent.

601
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,468
- No!
- Out!

602
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:23,192
"Why, I oughta<i>...</i>"

603
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:27,388
Oh, God!

604
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:31,953
Yes, sir, but I think that's what I like
about Peggy, Mr. Kelcher.

605
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:35,232
She's not like all the other girls at school.

606
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:40,478
Charlie, in spite of your adolescent
infatuation with music...

607
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:43,558
...we've always regarded you
as a very fine young man.

608
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:46,950
- Thank you, sir.
- And we've trusted you with our daughter.

609
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:49,349
Well, trust is a two-way street.

610
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,239
In the past two years...

611
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:55,199
...l've been pleased to note
that you and Mrs. Kelcher...

612
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:58,272
...have provided your sacred trust
with upbringing the woman...

613
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:00,396
...that I plan to take off your hands.

614
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:06,393
Charlie's downstairs.
Why aren't you ready?

615
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:10,277
- For what?
- For Maddy's party, that's for what!

616
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:13,390
Mom, I don't feel like going to a party.

617
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:17,268
Feel or not feel, you accepted the invite.
Maddy's one of your best friends.

618
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:19,555
I baked the Rice Krispie squares.

619
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:22,558
You're supposed to be doing
your homework.

620
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:24,870
I need to talk to your sister.

621
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:27,595
Baby.

622
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:30,191
Try and enjoy yourself.

623
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:33,318
This is the best time of your whole life.

624
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:36,597
The sooner you learn to handle Charlie,
the better.

625
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,552
Stand up to Charlie.

626
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:45,076
Be a good girl.
Wear something cheerful. Perky.

627
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:52,949
We think this party might cheer her up.

628
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:55,675
As long as you understand
what's expected of you.

629
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:56,909
What would that be?

630
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,754
Show her a good time,
but for heaven's sake, restrain yourself!

631
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:02,479
Of course!

632
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:07,039
- Hi.
- Hi.

633
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:09,354
Charlie?

634
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:11,478
Your sweater!

635
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:14,353
- It's great, isn't it?
- It's really '50s!

636
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:16,556
It's like you clash with the whole world.

637
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:20,116
What's the fun of being a teenager
if you can't dress weird?

638
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:24,198
- Good night, Dad.
- Good night!

639
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:26,555
- Good night, Mom.
- Be good, dear.

640
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:29,555
- Good night, Mr. And Mrs. Kelcher.
- Good-bye.

641
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:31,835
Have a good time, youngsters!

642
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:36,513
Nancy.

643
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,991
You look really beautiful.

644
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:53,399
Thank you.

645
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:57,309
- I cleaned the car. Do you like it?
- Yeah, looks better at night.

646
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:00,193
I got tickets for Fabian on your birthday.

647
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:02,919
You like him, right? Yeah, he's cool.

648
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:19,033
I was thinking of four ushers
and four bridesmaids.

649
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:21,998
The Yankees have the pitching,
but the White Sox have defence.

650
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:23,479
What will your colours be?

651
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:26,028
Kubek and Richardson any day
over Fox and Aparicio.

652
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:27,348
Pink and green.

653
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:29,719
- Look, Carol!
- What?

654
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:31,438
Look at Delores. What a tramp.

655
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:32,350
My God!

656
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:34,590
I think that pitching wins pennants.

657
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:38,278
The Tigers have got four
twenty-game potential winners.

658
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:41,477
You'd be surprised
at how many girls in school aren't virgins.

659
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:42,549
Like who?

660
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:46,633
Don Mossi, Frank Lary,
Jim Bunning and Paul Foytack.

661
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:52,959
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Hello!

662
00:47:56,440 --> 00:48:00,558
<i>And now, direct from four weeks</i>
<i>of rehearsal in Walter's garage...</i>

663
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:04,679
<i>... four guys who have prided themselves</i>
<i>on becoming the best group in the world.</i>

664
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:09,038
<i>Walter, Leon, Terry and Charlie,</i>
<i>The Definitions!</i>

665
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:45,632
Charlie can really sing!

666
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:48,188
Maybe they'll be
the next Dion and the Belmonts!

667
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:49,599
I wouldn't count on it.

668
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:51,432
Come on! Where's your enthusiasm?

669
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:07,077
He really is kind of cute, isn't he?

670
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:08,434
Yeah!

671
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:12,516
He really loves you, too. You're so lucky!

672
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:14,795
He's always telling Walter
how wonderful you are.

673
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:16,108
- He is?
- Yeah!

674
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:37,193
Carol and I saw you
with that creep Richard Norvik today.

675
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:40,033
First of all, he's not a creep.
He's exceptional.

676
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:42,350
You'd know that if you took any time.

677
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:45,159
You just pity him since he has no friends.

678
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:47,830
If you weren't so neurotic and insecure...

679
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:50,878
...maybe you could shut up
and show some compassion.

680
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:52,393
Are you for real?

681
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:56,473
I don't know what you said to her,
but I wish I'd said it.

682
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:57,913
Hi, fellas.

683
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:20,273
Walter!

684
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:34,596
- What do you think about Richard Norvik?
- He's a nice guy.

685
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:38,508
Is he going to help you
with all that physics stuff?

686
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:39,794
He's trying.

687
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:44,273
Who needs physics
when we've got chemistry?

688
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:47,597
Put on some make-out music
and turn out the lights!

689
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:07,715
There's not a girl in school
that can hold a candle to you.

690
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:11,473
You're pretty charming
when you want to be.

691
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:18,117
I know. But I don't have to flatter you.

692
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:22,152
It just feels right.

693
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:26,036
You're the perfect girl for me...

694
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:30,111
...as in: Is, was...

695
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,831
...and always will be.

696
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:42,830
I'm glad dancing was invented.

697
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:46,873
You know, the first dances were rituals.

698
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:51,236
Like fertility rites.

699
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:12,874
I always loved the way you kissed.

700
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:16,758
I missed you.

701
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:26,952
Your eyes look like silver pools
of moonlight.

702
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:30,991
And the tide rushes in.

703
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:35,950
You really love me, don't you?

704
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:40,670
You know I do.
I even wrote you into my will.

705
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:48,477
Charlie, let's make love.

706
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:52,318
What? You mean sex?

707
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:56,479
Intercourse.

708
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:00,990
You want to have intercourse?

709
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:05,509
Last weekend you said<i>...</i> What time is it?

710
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:08,069
Holy cow, it's late!

711
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:11,197
A lot of things have happened
since last weekend.

712
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:14,512
You were the one who said we should wait
and you were right.

713
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:17,068
We should wait till we get married.

714
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:20,393
I know I must have believed that...

715
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:23,119
...when I said it, but...

716
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,794
...doesn't Lucky Chucky want to come out?
- Who?

717
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:29,391
You know, your love machine.

718
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:34,030
Your throbbing thrill hammer. Your thing.

719
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:37,318
You mean my wang?

720
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:42,112
Listen, it's running real late!

721
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:53,151
Come on! What is this?

722
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:56,874
What the hell is going on, Peggy Sue?

723
00:53:57,240 --> 00:53:59,754
One week you say,
"If you love me, you won't."

724
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:02,229
The next week you say,
"If you love me, you will."

725
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:04,072
That's a guy's line!

726
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:08,634
Forget about it. I made a mistake.

727
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:10,597
You're damn right!

728
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:14,870
Jesus, Peggy,
you sure know how to spoil a mood.

729
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:25,028
I'm sorry.

730
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:28,033
Save it, woman! Humiliator!

731
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:22,033
I was very impressed with what you said
in English class today.

732
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:28,195
Gilford's okay, except that he thinks
that Hemingway's great literature.

733
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:29,759
And you don't?

734
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:32,198
He's a fisherman.

735
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:34,874
The most overrated writer of the century.

736
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:37,599
I mean, man,
he is the perfect American author:

737
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:39,591
Fat, violent, drunk.

738
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:43,592
Maybe you're confusing his life
with his work.

739
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:45,830
A writer's life is his work.

740
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:49,869
Jack Kerouac doesn't have to kill a bull
to have something to write about!

741
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:53,873
I mean, man, he's out there burning,
feeling, grooving on life!

742
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:57,589
"The young man leaned back in his chair.

743
00:55:57,800 --> 00:55:59,791
"No bulls would die today."

744
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:08,474
What are you doing here, anyway?

745
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:10,193
Coffee, donuts.

746
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:15,398
I thought chicks like you travelled in packs.

747
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:20,875
Man, I'm a hip chick.

748
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:36,350
- Come on, Delores.
- Terry, slow down!

749
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:37,555
What?

750
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:41,317
Look, there's Peggy Sue
with Michael Fitzsimmons!

751
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:46,192
- That Commie beatnik?
- First a geek and now a weirdo!

752
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:55,759
This is great.

753
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:08,631
This is great reefer.

754
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:15,799
It must belong to Beth.

755
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:18,348
I found it in my dress. It's really old.

756
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:20,632
It travels well.

757
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:26,513
Well, the world sure looks better up here.

758
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:31,191
The world is fantastic.

759
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:35,674
It's the ultimate absurd circus.

760
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:41,069
And I am shot from a cannon
into the energy.

761
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:43,636
What are you shooting for?

762
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:47,073
Maximum intensity.

763
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:51,439
I'm going to get out of here.
I'm going to write.

764
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:53,556
I'm checking out of this bourgeois motel.

765
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:56,154
Push myself away from the dinner table
and say:

766
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:58,800
"No more Jell-O for me, Mom!"

767
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:09,749
Don't you get along with your parents?

768
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:12,990
All my father digs is money.

769
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:16,910
All my mother cares about
is her standing at the country club.

770
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,878
Come on! They care about you.

771
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:23,916
- They're just a different generation.
- What's with you?

772
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:27,276
I thought you were cool.

773
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:29,988
You rode my bike. You blew some pot.

774
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,673
What's your scene, Miss Majorette?

775
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:38,637
You going to marry Mr. Blue lmpala...

776
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:42,230
...and graze around with the other sheep
for the rest of your life?

777
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:45,234
No. I already did that.

778
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:51,597
I want to be a dancer.

779
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,911
That's what I want to do.

780
00:58:56,920 --> 00:59:00,037
I'm going to dance and dance.

781
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:06,119
Come here.

782
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:09,470
You know, I had you pegged all wrong.

783
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:16,034
"Ray of oneness piercing the solitude

784
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:19,793
"Falling bodies in the ecstasy of flesh"

785
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:23,717
Is that one of your poems?

786
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:25,438
No, I just made that up.

787
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:28,839
- Do you want to hear one?
- Yeah.

788
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:34,631
It's called <i>Tenderness.</i>

789
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:40,229
"I couldn't sleep so I thought I'd scream

790
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:45,950
"Betrayed by a kiss
Sucking pods of bitterness

791
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:50,949
"In the madhouse of Doctor Dread
Razor shreds of rat puke

792
00:59:51,080 --> 00:59:53,230
"Fall on my bare arms"

793
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:05,439
I'm sorry. I was trying to impress you.

794
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:18,155
Michael. You're as good as you looked.

795
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:29,870
"How many loved your moments
of glad grace

796
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:33,191
"And loved your beauty
with love false or true

797
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:39,313
"But one man loved the pilgrim soul in you

798
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:42,632
"And loved the sorrows
of your changing face"

799
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:46,957
I didn't write that. That's Yeats.

800
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:55,358
I envy you.

801
01:00:56,520 --> 01:01:00,718
You have your whole life ahead of you
and you know exactly what you want.

802
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:04,157
But no more rat puke, okay?

803
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:07,034
Try and write something beautiful.

804
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:10,630
I'll respect you for eternity.

805
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:19,559
You know, this really isn't happening.

806
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:48,598
- And one Shostakovich.
- Shostakovich?

807
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:51,148
Charlie, I'm just taking Ravel!

808
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:54,314
Listen. Take the Shostakovich home.

809
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:57,274
Listen to it. Let it grow on you.

810
01:01:57,800 --> 01:02:00,997
If you don't like it
I will give you your money back.

811
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:05,150
I did like the Dvork one you suggested.
I liked that a lot.

812
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:07,356
And, young man, you talked me into it.

813
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:09,192
It's the most definitive Dvork!

814
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:11,875
You'll like it. I kid you not.

815
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:25,670
- What do you know about classical music?
- Nothing. But selling is selling.

816
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:27,918
Charlie, about last night...

817
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:31,879
Hush, baby, hush. I've been thinking.

818
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:34,714
Girls must go through that stuff, too.

819
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:37,832
Sometimes when I look at you
I feel like an animal.

820
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:41,469
I don't know. Maybe my dad's right.
Teenagers are nuts.

821
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:43,033
But I'm not.

822
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:47,910
I'm a grown woman with a lifetime
of experiences you can't understand.

823
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:51,354
Girls mature faster than guys.

824
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:55,876
But last night,
I was the one who put on the brakes.

825
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:59,715
- And do you know why?
- Why?

826
01:03:00,560 --> 01:03:02,755
Because nothing else matters.

827
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:05,475
That's the great thing about love.

828
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:07,312
Every time we argue...

829
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:11,229
...every time something goes wrong,
and I know I'm not perfect either...

830
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:13,590
...things just work out better in the end.

831
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:17,751
Because you're my baby. And I love you.

832
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:23,752
Charlie, what am I going to do with you?

833
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:29,079
Boy! Just cherish me.

834
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,673
You have an opportunity
to be the richest woman in the world...

835
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:35,432
...and I'm going to be your partner.

836
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:37,909
I'll tell you where the fortune is:
Running shoes...

837
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,560
...tennis and jogging shoes,
all that kind of stuff.

838
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:43,359
I mean, I'm talking $50, $100, $200 a pair.

839
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:45,476
- Wait, you got to be kidding.
- No!

840
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:48,518
You're talking about exercise stuff?
Like gym stuff?

841
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:50,113
Not your style.

842
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:52,350
These are the choices, okay?

843
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:56,753
Microwave ovens, pocket calculators...

844
01:03:57,640 --> 01:04:01,474
...Walkmans, digital watches...

845
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:04,035
...and miniature television sets.

846
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:05,473
And huge radios.

847
01:04:05,560 --> 01:04:10,076
For some reason everything else gets tiny,
but portable radios get enormous.

848
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:12,196
Huge, enormous radios?

849
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:16,030
- Portable enormous radios.
- Wait a minute, I got an idea. Come on!

850
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:17,633
- What?
- Come on!

851
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:21,469
Come here!

852
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:24,349
Here.

853
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:29,799
- Excuse me, miss.
- Yes.

854
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:32,269
- Do you have pantyhose?
- I'm sorry, what?

855
01:04:32,360 --> 01:04:34,271
Pantyhose. You know<i>...</i>

856
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:35,799
"Pantyhose"?

857
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:37,319
Why, Richard!

858
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:39,352
This is lingerie.

859
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:44,708
Mrs. Woodhouse, I am studying the fabric
for the aerodynamic principles for kites.

860
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:46,199
They don't have it!

861
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:48,475
They've never heard of it.
Isn't it wonderful?

862
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:51,154
- What?
- I'm talking about the wave of the future.

863
01:04:51,240 --> 01:04:53,629
I've decided on our first fortune.

864
01:04:53,720 --> 01:04:55,073
- I'll see you later.
- Okay.

865
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:57,355
You just keep thinking high tech.

866
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:02,668
"High tech"? That's nice.

867
01:05:03,120 --> 01:05:05,634
I like the sound of that. High tech.

868
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:23,635
- All right, what is the scoop?
- What?

869
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:26,234
How come we're your friends
and we find out about...

870
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:28,436
...you and Michael Fitzsimmons
from Delores?

871
01:05:28,520 --> 01:05:31,671
Who needs satellites
when I've got Delores' mouth?

872
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:34,035
I hear she does more than talk
with her mouth.

873
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:35,269
That's disgusting!

874
01:05:35,360 --> 01:05:36,873
Maddy, would you grow up?

875
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:39,838
It says in <i>Love Without Fear</i>
the tongue kiss is a means...

876
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:43,629
...of genital stimulation, is widely practised
and has much to commend it!

877
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:46,150
Did you memorise the book
or just the good parts?

878
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:48,470
No. Just what you underlined.

879
01:05:48,840 --> 01:05:50,068
You did!

880
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:52,834
You know, Carol, you have great hair.

881
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:56,033
Peggy Sue, come on!
What's with you and Michael?

882
01:05:56,120 --> 01:05:58,953
Yeah, come on!
He's so cool and mysterious.

883
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:00,951
Well, he's interesting.

884
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:07,555
Underneath that rough exterior
lurks the heart of a true poet.

885
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:09,594
A poet?

886
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:13,477
I bet Delores told Charlie!

887
01:06:13,560 --> 01:06:16,120
- That loudmouthed little bitch!
- Peggy Sue!

888
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:18,634
Watch out for her, Peggy Sue.
She's after Charlie.

889
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:20,358
Just cool it, girls.

890
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:24,311
Charlie's free to go out
with whoever he wants to.

891
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:25,549
What?

892
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:28,354
But I always thought
you were going to marry Charlie.

893
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:31,637
Carol would marry Walter
and I'd marry Arthur.

894
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:34,234
We'd all live on the same street and...

895
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:38,552
...take our kids to the park together
and have barbecues every Sunday.

896
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:41,791
It's going to spoil everything
if you and Charlie break up.

897
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:45,236
That Michael Fitzsimmons
doesn't look like the barbecue type.

898
01:06:45,320 --> 01:06:49,791
Come on! I just had one date with him.
I'm not going to marry him!

899
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:51,672
You promise?

900
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:54,231
Come on, let's go to the movies.

901
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:58,628
Peggy Sue, I mean, don't be silly.
It's Saturday night. It's date night.

902
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:00,836
I got to go. Arthur's picking me up soon.

903
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:03,388
Wait a minute. No, I mean just the girls.

904
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:05,516
Like a slumber party.

905
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:09,195
- Aren't we too old for that?
- Sometimes you're so immature.

906
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:10,349
Well, we<i>...</i>

907
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:11,595
'Bye!

908
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:14,313
I'm immature?

909
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:56,556
Charlie? Charlie, I had such a dream.

910
01:07:57,240 --> 01:08:00,630
Peggy Sue, I have to talk to you.

911
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:04,309
Charlie, what are you doing here?

912
01:08:05,120 --> 01:08:07,350
Let's go down to the basement.

913
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:09,995
Okay.

914
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:22,075
I want to know what's going on.

915
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:27,556
Delores told me about you
and that scuzzball Michael Fitzsimmons.

916
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:32,635
When you dropped me off last night
I didn't feel like going to bed.

917
01:08:32,720 --> 01:08:36,508
- And I ran into Michael and went for a ride.
- Then it's true, damn it!

918
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:43,392
I had a miserable time tonight
because of you.

919
01:08:46,160 --> 01:08:48,196
When the Monotones did <i>Book of Love</i>:

920
01:08:48,280 --> 01:08:51,590
"Chapter four, you break up
Won't you give it one more chance?"

921
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:53,955
I'm thinking, "Did we break up?"

922
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:56,313
Did we break up?

923
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:59,198
Because if we did
I don't even know about it.

924
01:08:59,280 --> 01:09:03,592
Did that Maynard G. Beatnik
give you what you wanted?

925
01:09:03,680 --> 01:09:05,910
You know, I hate your sarcasm.

926
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:09,229
You're going to blow it, Peggy Sue.

927
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:12,558
No one treats Charlie Bodell like this.

928
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:16,709
Why do you talk about yourself in the third
person like you were Napoleon?

929
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:20,713
- Why is everything an argument with you?
- Look! I've got the hair.

930
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:23,792
I've got the teeth. I've got the eyes.

931
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:28,471
Peggy, look outside that window.
I've got the car. I'm the lead singer.

932
01:09:29,080 --> 01:09:33,676
I'm the man.
Why are you arguing with me?

933
01:09:33,760 --> 01:09:37,912
It's over, Charlie. I don't want to hurt you.

934
01:09:38,160 --> 01:09:39,912
I want you to be happy.

935
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:43,277
But, no. I will be happy if I have you.

936
01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:44,995
I love you.

937
01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:47,674
No! That doesn't make any difference.

938
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:49,631
We just can't live together.

939
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:51,870
And you went off with that bimbo Janet.

940
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:54,076
What are you talking about?

941
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:55,514
Who is Janet?

942
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:58,034
- I don't know any Janet.
- I just can't trust you!

943
01:09:58,120 --> 01:10:01,430
But what about everything
I said to you this afternoon?

944
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:03,431
That's exactly what I'm talking about.

945
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:07,877
I have this window in my heart
and anytime you want, you can crawl in.

946
01:10:07,960 --> 01:10:10,520
I got to close it
or nothing's going to be different.

947
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:12,750
- What has to be different?
- Everything!

948
01:10:12,840 --> 01:10:17,118
You know it's not going to work like this.
You have to go to college and finish.

949
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:19,998
What about the group
and my singing career?

950
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:21,559
What about me?

951
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:27,034
I am trying to save you years of frustration
of waiting for...

952
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:28,633
...that big break. No.

953
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:32,633
That big disappointment so you can
blame me for the rest of your life.

954
01:10:32,720 --> 01:10:34,472
You don't know zip.

955
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:39,312
You think I'm going to spend
the rest of my life selling appliances?

956
01:10:39,400 --> 01:10:42,392
Chasing women around the store
like my father?

957
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:45,430
I've got to give it a shot.

958
01:10:46,520 --> 01:10:49,114
What the hell has changed, Peggy Sue?

959
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:52,597
Until yesterday you loved me
and you loved us.

960
01:10:55,560 --> 01:10:59,348
For two years,
I've done nothing but love you.

961
01:11:01,240 --> 01:11:04,391
All right, I'll prove it to you. I'll show you.

962
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:06,710
I'm going to be just like Fabian.

963
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:10,759
Let's sit there.

964
01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:12,308
Sure.

965
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:26,199
This is great.

966
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:30,873
Okay, here we go.

967
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:32,951
- Suds for you.
- Thank you.

968
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:34,871
And a whiskey for you.

969
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:43,836
Five more weeks of school.

970
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:48,876
Ten minutes past graduation, I'm gone!
To freedom!

971
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:51,113
For everyone.

972
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:54,278
Now, this is the plan.

973
01:12:54,360 --> 01:12:57,238
As soon as school is finished,
we move to Utah.

974
01:12:57,760 --> 01:12:58,875
Utah?

975
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:02,674
I thought you'd be going to Paris
or New York.

976
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:03,875
What's in Utah?

977
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:08,511
Rita. I met her last summer. She's cool.
You'll really dig her.

978
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:13,635
She's got this little cabin outside the hills
of Provo where she raises chickens.

979
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:17,748
I'll write, and you two can take care
of the chickens to support us.

980
01:13:18,120 --> 01:13:20,839
- I can't do that.
- Why not?

981
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:22,758
Polygamy's legal in Utah.

982
01:13:24,040 --> 01:13:25,871
I'm allergic to chickens.

983
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:34,751
Wait. What about the other night?

984
01:13:35,560 --> 01:13:38,711
We were like two stars
in the same constellation.

985
01:13:40,120 --> 01:13:44,796
Michael, you and I are light-years apart.
You should go, but not with me.

986
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:49,590
But we had heat, baby. Passion! Fire!

987
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:53,637
We owe it to ourselves to fuse together.

988
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:56,591
At least one more time.

989
01:13:57,520 --> 01:14:00,830
That's a great line.
You are going to be a terrific writer.

990
01:14:02,840 --> 01:14:05,513
- You think so?
- Yeah.

991
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:11,514
Michael,
we had one glorious night together.

992
01:14:12,200 --> 01:14:15,033
Someday you'll remember
and write about it.

993
01:14:17,240 --> 01:14:18,355
Yeah.

994
01:14:19,960 --> 01:14:20,949
I can dig that.

995
01:14:23,080 --> 01:14:24,991
Bittersweet perfection.

996
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:29,992
Dogs of lust on leashes of memory. Yes!

997
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:34,433
It's Charlie.

998
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:36,313
What a treat.

999
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:40,909
Now I get it.

1000
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:42,919
It's great.

1001
01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:47,477
Peggy Sue's still stuck on
"Treble Without a Cause."

1002
01:14:48,040 --> 01:14:49,951
Come on, I want to dance.

1003
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:12,394
I thought I knew everything about him.

1004
01:15:12,720 --> 01:15:14,233
Can we split now?

1005
01:15:42,440 --> 01:15:43,759
Thank you.

1006
01:15:46,720 --> 01:15:48,915
So, Mr. Wilkins, new client?

1007
01:15:50,120 --> 01:15:51,792
I'm sorry, Charlie.

1008
01:15:55,280 --> 01:15:57,350
I don't think so, you know.

1009
01:15:58,680 --> 01:16:00,875
It happens, but not with you.

1010
01:16:01,160 --> 01:16:02,718
Believe me when I tell you.

1011
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:05,360
Maybe it's the material.
But it can't happen.

1012
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:30,228
Good morning.

1013
01:16:33,240 --> 01:16:34,673
Charlie?

1014
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:45,716
What are you doing here?

1015
01:16:46,160 --> 01:16:48,116
I wanted to talk to you.

1016
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:51,996
I've got one last thing
I have to do at school and then<i>...</i>

1017
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:56,396
Elvis. Hi. How are you? Hi, guy.

1018
01:16:56,480 --> 01:16:58,550
Elvis is dead. That's Ajax.

1019
01:17:01,320 --> 01:17:03,470
I guess I always liked Elvis.

1020
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:06,709
- Can I have a ride to school?
- No.

1021
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:10,595
- Why?
- The tiger's out of commission for a while.

1022
01:17:10,840 --> 01:17:11,875
Come on.

1023
01:17:12,120 --> 01:17:16,159
- How about a walk, Charlie Bell?
- How did you know about that?

1024
01:17:16,320 --> 01:17:18,709
I was at Lena's last night.
I heard you sing.

1025
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:20,438
I thought you were terrific.

1026
01:17:20,520 --> 01:17:23,114
Not terrific enough.
What were you doing there?

1027
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:25,919
- Who were you with?
- Well, what were you doing there?

1028
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,195
You never told me you sang
with an R & B group.

1029
01:17:28,280 --> 01:17:32,159
There's not a whole heck of a lot
we know about each other, Peggy.

1030
01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:37,712
- I forgot how much music meant to you.
- That's real big of you.

1031
01:17:38,160 --> 01:17:40,390
Stop being so defensive. Here.

1032
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:43,431
I wrote a song for you.

1033
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:48,749
- Why did you write me a song?
- Because I want to help you.

1034
01:17:50,280 --> 01:17:54,114
- It'll be a hit. I promise.
- Come on! Stop being sarcastic.

1035
01:17:54,720 --> 01:17:57,393
Lee Wilkins came to hear me last night.

1036
01:17:57,640 --> 01:18:00,234
He told me to forget it.

1037
01:18:02,200 --> 01:18:04,270
Would you just take a look at it?

1038
01:18:04,720 --> 01:18:06,870
Come on. I wrote it for you.

1039
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:11,116
Well, if you wrote it I guess I'll look at it.

1040
01:18:13,720 --> 01:18:17,190
Listen, about the other night,
I feel so stupid.

1041
01:18:18,280 --> 01:18:22,671
I'm beginning to think that maybe
there is more to life than just music.

1042
01:18:24,520 --> 01:18:28,911
Do you think the world would still like me
if I stopped being Mr. Excitement?

1043
01:18:31,880 --> 01:18:32,995
Yeah.

1044
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:37,235
Do you want to walk to school?

1045
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:40,030
Okay, I'll just put the dog inside.

1046
01:18:40,680 --> 01:18:41,954
Come on, Ajax.

1047
01:18:45,680 --> 01:18:48,478
What's the matter, princess?
Lost your prince?

1048
01:18:49,800 --> 01:18:53,509
Delores, there are a lot of things
I could say to you...

1049
01:18:53,680 --> 01:18:56,069
...but you're just not worth the effort.

1050
01:18:57,360 --> 01:19:01,956
- I'm so sorry. These pens are so tricky, I<i>...</i>
- You did that on purpose!

1051
01:19:02,600 --> 01:19:06,149
I hate you! Go stuff your bra!

1052
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:10,555
- I beg your pardon?
- Take a long walk on a short pier.

1053
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:12,592
Have a nice day.

1054
01:19:25,720 --> 01:19:29,759
You know, Peggy, there are so many things
to look forward to in the future.

1055
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:35,831
I came to say good-bye, Richard.

1056
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:39,117
Good-bye? Wait a minute. Sit down.

1057
01:19:40,680 --> 01:19:45,117
Good-bye? Where are you going?
Peggy, we have a partnership here.

1058
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:48,749
- I'm making progress on that microchip.
- Well, you were meant to.

1059
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:51,354
You're one of the people
good things happen to.

1060
01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:52,589
So are you.

1061
01:19:52,920 --> 01:19:55,798
- You have a vision, Peggy.
- A vision?

1062
01:19:56,840 --> 01:19:58,910
I am a walking anachronism!

1063
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:03,151
I've upset my parents. I miss my kids.

1064
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:07,194
I could be trapped here forever.
And poor Charlie.

1065
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:11,194
I got pregnant when I was 18.
That was why we had to get married.

1066
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:13,153
Tomorrow's my birthday.

1067
01:20:13,240 --> 01:20:16,755
- I have to get out of here.
- You broke up with Charlie?

1068
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:20,229
Yeah. I know it's a gamble.

1069
01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:23,315
I've loved him for a long, long time.

1070
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:26,557
Okay. Then let's do something
really visionary.

1071
01:20:26,840 --> 01:20:29,115
Change your destiny, Peggy Sue.

1072
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:33,116
Change your destiny and marry me.

1073
01:20:34,760 --> 01:20:39,231
No! Peggy Sue got married.

1074
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:41,159
Case closed.

1075
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:44,474
I don't want to marry anyone, Richard.

1076
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:45,989
Good-bye.

1077
01:20:46,280 --> 01:20:48,669
Wait! Peggy, please. Can I go with you?

1078
01:20:48,760 --> 01:20:51,911
No! You have to be valedictorian.

1079
01:20:58,840 --> 01:21:00,831
Peggy Sue, wait a minute!

1080
01:21:01,280 --> 01:21:04,590
Listen, I cut shop
and I did some work on your song.

1081
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:07,954
You know, it's not half bad
for your first try.

1082
01:21:08,040 --> 01:21:11,112
I changed all the "yeahs" to "oohs,"
but listen to this:

1083
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:14,590
"She loves you, ooh, ooh, ooh
You love me, ooh, ooh, ooh"

1084
01:21:16,240 --> 01:21:17,389
I got to go.

1085
01:21:17,480 --> 01:21:20,995
About your birthday.
I made reservations at Chez Trev.

1086
01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:24,238
I thought it would be great to eat
at a nice restaurant.

1087
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:25,912
I won't be here.

1088
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:29,551
- Why?
- I want to go see my grandparents.

1089
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:32,238
Good-bye, Charlie.

1090
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:35,588
I cancelled the tickets for Fabian.

1091
01:22:21,880 --> 01:22:22,949
Close that.

1092
01:22:23,040 --> 01:22:24,758
- There you are.
- Thank you.

1093
01:22:26,680 --> 01:22:30,309
Look! Oh, it's so beautiful.

1094
01:23:03,800 --> 01:23:07,156
What's the matter, Peggy?
Someone jump on your grave?

1095
01:23:14,440 --> 01:23:18,274
You know, Peggy, your mother said
you had a dream that I died.

1096
01:23:19,080 --> 01:23:20,911
I wish she hadn't have told you that.

1097
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:24,788
I'm not afraid.
I know exactly when I'm going to die.

1098
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:28,395
What's it going to be, Lizzy?
Seventy-five or eighty?

1099
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:30,992
I'm not telling!

1100
01:23:31,080 --> 01:23:33,958
I've been trying to drag
that out of her for years.

1101
01:23:34,120 --> 01:23:36,918
You know,
dreams are a fascinating business.

1102
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:41,033
- Especially when you see the future.
- Do you believe all this?

1103
01:23:41,360 --> 01:23:45,433
Well, I like to speculate.
Like this book I'm reading right now.

1104
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:50,514
It's about a woman in Colorado who says
she lived in Ireland 150 years ago.

1105
01:23:51,200 --> 01:23:54,033
She gives names,
dates and where she lived.

1106
01:23:55,360 --> 01:23:56,998
Grandma. Grandpa.

1107
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,070
I want to tell you something.

1108
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:09,229
If you believe it, darling, then I believe.

1109
01:24:10,240 --> 01:24:13,232
Being young is just as confusing
as being old.

1110
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:16,914
The things that happened to me
50 years ago...

1111
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:20,151
...are more on my mind
than the things that happen today.

1112
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:23,395
But I'm remembering the future.

1113
01:24:25,160 --> 01:24:27,116
A chilling wind tonight.

1114
01:24:28,720 --> 01:24:30,358
It's really picking up.

1115
01:24:30,440 --> 01:24:33,989
Right now,
you're just browsing through time.

1116
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,594
Choose the things you'll be proud of.

1117
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:40,678
Things that last.

1118
01:24:41,720 --> 01:24:43,711
I'm proud of my children.

1119
01:24:44,120 --> 01:24:45,872
I miss them so much.

1120
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:48,993
Scott and Beth.

1121
01:24:50,480 --> 01:24:52,391
I named my daughter after you.

1122
01:24:54,920 --> 01:24:58,310
Sweetheart, thank you.

1123
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:05,828
Grandpa.

1124
01:25:08,840 --> 01:25:11,718
When you and Grandma are gone,
the family's gone.

1125
01:25:11,800 --> 01:25:13,791
And I'll never see the cousins anymore.

1126
01:25:13,880 --> 01:25:17,668
It's your grandma's strudel
that's kept this family together.

1127
01:25:17,960 --> 01:25:22,078
If you could do it all again, Grandpa,
what would you do different?

1128
01:25:22,680 --> 01:25:25,353
I'd have taken better care of my teeth.

1129
01:25:26,080 --> 01:25:29,117
Now what's Peggy Sue going to do
at your lodge meeting?

1130
01:25:30,360 --> 01:25:33,272
It's her 18th birthday
and I want to show her off.

1131
01:25:33,440 --> 01:25:36,989
It was my idea, Grandma.
I wondered about those lodge meetings.

1132
01:25:37,080 --> 01:25:39,435
He won't tell me.
But I have my suspicions.

1133
01:25:39,520 --> 01:25:41,750
I don't want to know.
Have a good time, darling.

1134
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:43,159
All right.

1135
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:47,349
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye, darling.

1136
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:50,028
Grandpa?

1137
01:25:50,360 --> 01:25:53,079
What does Grandma think you do
at these meetings?

1138
01:25:53,160 --> 01:25:54,991
Stag movies and poker.

1139
01:26:01,240 --> 01:26:04,710
I may be an old fool,
but I think I can help you.

1140
01:26:06,280 --> 01:26:09,158
At least I got to see you
and Grandma again.

1141
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:12,190
Has this ever worked before?

1142
01:26:12,320 --> 01:26:17,110
The last time was 600 years ago.
And it's about time for another one.

1143
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,116
Welcome, Peggy Sue!

1144
01:26:46,600 --> 01:26:49,672
Peggy Sue! Welcome, Peggy Sue!

1145
01:26:49,800 --> 01:26:52,678
- It's so wonderful to have you here with us.
- Thank you.

1146
01:26:52,760 --> 01:26:56,355
You've come to the right place.
Our lodge was founded by a time traveller.

1147
01:26:56,440 --> 01:26:58,874
- We're going to send you back home.
- That's right!

1148
01:26:58,960 --> 01:27:01,155
You know, this is very exciting for all of us.

1149
01:27:01,240 --> 01:27:05,472
You know, we've waited a long time
to find a girl like you.

1150
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:06,669
Yes!

1151
01:27:06,760 --> 01:27:10,673
Grandpa! Do you have to wear that hat?

1152
01:27:11,040 --> 01:27:12,678
Wouldn't be a lodge without hats.

1153
01:28:07,160 --> 01:28:08,957
"Lord of the universe.

1154
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:11,752
"Vast and mighty one.

1155
01:28:12,520 --> 01:28:14,033
"Ruler of light.

1156
01:28:15,080 --> 01:28:16,672
"King of the sun.

1157
01:28:16,960 --> 01:28:19,872
"This girl is lost amid your mysteries...

1158
01:28:19,960 --> 01:28:22,599
"...and wishes to return to her own time.

1159
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:26,032
"We adore thee and invoke thee!

1160
01:28:26,440 --> 01:28:28,032
"Grant thine aid.

1161
01:28:28,560 --> 01:28:33,350
"Look with favour upon us
as we witness the regeneration of spirit.

1162
01:28:35,120 --> 01:28:36,872
"We ask thy intervention...

1163
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:41,909
"...that this girl may return to thee
on the wings of thy love."

1164
01:28:43,760 --> 01:28:48,038
"Womb of the mother,
reclaim thy child of light."

1165
01:28:48,600 --> 01:28:50,989
"The name of your love is rebirth."

1166
01:28:51,440 --> 01:28:54,318
- This is never going to work.
- It's going to work!

1167
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:57,198
"Reclaim thy child of light."

1168
01:28:57,280 --> 01:29:02,274
"We offer up this girl
that her soul may find its home."

1169
01:29:10,600 --> 01:29:15,355
It's nothing to worry about.
Somebody get the lights.

1170
01:29:17,080 --> 01:29:19,435
Somebody get the lights!

1171
01:29:22,360 --> 01:29:23,395
She's gone!

1172
01:29:25,680 --> 01:29:28,114
What the hell do you think you're doing?

1173
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:31,552
I'm saving you!
They were going to vaporise you!

1174
01:29:31,640 --> 01:29:35,997
Don't be ridiculous! They're harmless
old men! My grandfather was in there!

1175
01:29:36,080 --> 01:29:38,548
- Get in the car!
- I'm not getting in this monstrosity!

1176
01:29:38,840 --> 01:29:40,671
Well, the girl's gone.

1177
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:42,598
Let's play cards.

1178
01:29:54,720 --> 01:29:58,235
I've got good news.
Now sit down right here.

1179
01:29:58,560 --> 01:30:00,073
You've got two minutes!

1180
01:30:00,160 --> 01:30:02,993
I told my father
that I'm going to quit singing.

1181
01:30:03,080 --> 01:30:06,868
And he gave me 10 percent
of the business right now!

1182
01:30:06,960 --> 01:30:10,475
- What are you talking about?
- I know what you've been going through.

1183
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:12,596
You were just scared.

1184
01:30:12,760 --> 01:30:16,435
But you don't have to be scared anymore.
I can support you now.

1185
01:30:16,520 --> 01:30:18,670
- Shit!
- Peggy Sue?

1186
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:21,638
Will you marry me?

1187
01:30:21,720 --> 01:30:23,950
How can you know
what I've been going through?

1188
01:30:24,040 --> 01:30:27,350
Of course I'm scared!
I can't change anything.

1189
01:30:27,440 --> 01:30:29,795
- I can't help anybody.
- You're not listening to me.

1190
01:30:29,880 --> 01:30:32,235
- I'm proposing to you now.
- You betrayed me.

1191
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:34,515
You were never there for me
and the children.

1192
01:30:34,600 --> 01:30:38,513
I'll be there for the children.
I'll forget Walter.

1193
01:30:38,960 --> 01:30:42,475
Forget the group. I want to marry you!

1194
01:30:42,720 --> 01:30:43,869
Don't be crazy.

1195
01:30:43,960 --> 01:30:47,714
I may be crazy, but I'm not crazy enough
to marry you twice.

1196
01:30:49,560 --> 01:30:50,834
Christ.

1197
01:30:52,560 --> 01:30:53,788
Peggy.

1198
01:30:57,040 --> 01:30:58,439
I'm sorry.

1199
01:31:02,360 --> 01:31:05,909
I thought I was what you wanted me to be.

1200
01:31:07,400 --> 01:31:09,072
It's all my fault.

1201
01:31:14,400 --> 01:31:15,515
Here.

1202
01:31:16,920 --> 01:31:18,876
It's a birthday present.

1203
01:31:20,360 --> 01:31:23,113
I'm tired of being the romantic fool.

1204
01:31:24,520 --> 01:31:26,636
I'm going to go save my car.

1205
01:31:28,120 --> 01:31:29,348
Charlie?

1206
01:31:32,680 --> 01:31:34,159
It opens, too.

1207
01:31:34,640 --> 01:31:36,039
Look inside.

1208
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:45,230
Scott and Beth. Where did you get this?

1209
01:31:45,760 --> 01:31:47,671
Who are Scott and Beth?

1210
01:31:48,840 --> 01:31:51,195
Your mother gave me those.
It's you and me.

1211
01:31:51,280 --> 01:31:52,759
You know that.

1212
01:31:54,760 --> 01:31:58,514
So are they.

1213
01:31:59,800 --> 01:32:01,472
I do love you.

1214
01:32:02,120 --> 01:32:03,473
I love you.

1215
01:32:06,600 --> 01:32:08,591
This is right, Peggy Sue.

1216
01:32:10,600 --> 01:32:12,636
I want this to be forever.

1217
01:32:20,600 --> 01:32:22,352
<i>Mom, can you hear me?</i>

1218
01:32:24,640 --> 01:32:26,517
<i>Please, Mom, can you hear me?</i>

1219
01:32:26,600 --> 01:32:28,477
<i>They call what happened a near-death...</i>

1220
01:32:28,560 --> 01:32:31,120
<i>... but we figured out</i>
<i>exactly what the problem is...</i>

1221
01:32:31,200 --> 01:32:33,191
<i>You are a very lucky young lady!</i>

1222
01:32:33,360 --> 01:32:36,432
<i>What happened to you, Peggy Sue,</i>
<i>was a very rare problem...</i>

1223
01:32:36,520 --> 01:32:38,272
<i>... with the rhythm of your heart.</i>

1224
01:32:38,360 --> 01:32:39,839
<i>Mom, do you remember anything?</i>

1225
01:32:39,920 --> 01:32:43,913
<i>In fact, at the party,</i>
<i>they had to do CPR on you...</i>

1226
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:48,709
<i>... before the paramedics arrived</i>
<i>to give your heart a shock and restart it.</i>

1227
01:32:48,840 --> 01:32:50,876
<i>Dad's been here every day.</i>

1228
01:32:51,200 --> 01:32:53,475
<i>"'Cause I love you, Peggy Sue</i>

1229
01:32:58,400 --> 01:33:01,870
"I love you, girl, and I need you, Peggy"

1230
01:33:09,480 --> 01:33:10,833
Charlie?

1231
01:33:12,240 --> 01:33:16,153
- Was I dead?
- I thought you were for a while.

1232
01:33:18,360 --> 01:33:19,839
You look awful.

1233
01:33:20,360 --> 01:33:23,033
You look like you haven't slept in days.

1234
01:33:24,120 --> 01:33:27,157
- You look so old.
- But happy.

1235
01:33:28,400 --> 01:33:30,470
Very happy, Peggy.

1236
01:33:31,640 --> 01:33:34,916
I thought I knew everything about you.
I'm sorry.

1237
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,036
I wanted to tell you that I<i>...</i>

1238
01:33:37,120 --> 01:33:39,236
- I wanted to...
- I'm sorry.

1239
01:33:39,360 --> 01:33:43,433
I can't live without you.

1240
01:33:46,440 --> 01:33:48,078
What about Janet?

1241
01:33:51,400 --> 01:33:55,234
That's over.
I got tired of translating everything to her.

1242
01:33:55,320 --> 01:33:58,153
She thought the Big Bopper
was a hamburger.

1243
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:05,872
- Who are all the flowers from?
- Everyone.

1244
01:34:06,480 --> 01:34:10,155
Maddy and Arthur, Carol and Walter...

1245
01:34:11,280 --> 01:34:13,111
...Richard Norvik.

1246
01:34:14,200 --> 01:34:18,955
And here's a book by that guy
in high school, Michael Fitzsimmons.

1247
01:34:19,880 --> 01:34:21,791
He dedicated it to you.

1248
01:34:27,360 --> 01:34:29,635
It couldn't be me. I hardly knew him.

1249
01:34:33,520 --> 01:34:35,750
I'll just set this right here.

1250
01:34:40,320 --> 01:34:42,550
I had a strange experience.

1251
01:34:43,760 --> 01:34:47,594
I went back to high school
and I spent a lot of time with you.

1252
01:34:48,960 --> 01:34:53,317
You and Walter and Leon were singing
<i>I Wonder Why.</i>

1253
01:34:53,960 --> 01:34:55,473
God! Dion!

1254
01:34:56,120 --> 01:34:57,792
You were terrific.

1255
01:34:59,120 --> 01:35:01,918
And I kept trying to push you away.

1256
01:35:03,200 --> 01:35:06,317
- But you wouldn't give up.
- I'll never give up.

1257
01:35:08,120 --> 01:35:09,792
Would you hold me?

1258
01:35:14,080 --> 01:35:19,108
I don't expect that all our problems
can just vanish.

1259
01:35:21,800 --> 01:35:25,679
Christ, I would cut my right arm off
for another chance.

1260
01:35:25,760 --> 01:35:29,389
No, please, I need some time.

1261
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:43,989
Well, I'll let you get some rest.

1262
01:35:54,240 --> 01:35:58,199
I'd like to invite you over to our house
for dinner on Sunday.

1263
01:35:58,920 --> 01:36:00,433
With your kids.

1264
01:36:03,960 --> 01:36:05,632
I'll make a strudel.
