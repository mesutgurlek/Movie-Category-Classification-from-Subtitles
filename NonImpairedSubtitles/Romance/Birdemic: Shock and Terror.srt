1
00:00:27,095 --> 00:00:30,297
(Whimsical score
playing)

2
00:04:42,582 --> 00:04:44,952
- Hi.
- Hi.

3
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:53,427
- Here's a menu.
- Thank you.

4
00:04:53,461 --> 00:04:55,563
I'll be right back
with you.

5
00:05:53,421 --> 00:05:54,888
- Excuse me, miss.
- Yes?

6
00:05:54,922 --> 00:05:56,890
I don't mean to bother you.

7
00:05:56,924 --> 00:05:58,591
What?

8
00:05:58,626 --> 00:05:59,927
I feel I know you
from somewhere.

9
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,561
Really?

10
00:06:01,595 --> 00:06:03,396
Yeah, did you go to
San mateo high school?

11
00:06:03,431 --> 00:06:05,699
- Yeah, how'd you know that?
- I went there too.

12
00:06:05,733 --> 00:06:08,901
- So are you from here?
- Not really.

13
00:06:08,936 --> 00:06:11,605
My mother lives up here
but I'm from San Francisco.

14
00:06:11,638 --> 00:06:12,805
What about you?

15
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,709
San Jose.
I remember you now.

16
00:06:15,743 --> 00:06:17,644
You were in
my English class.

17
00:06:17,678 --> 00:06:20,780
- I was?
- Yeah, I sat two seats
behind you.

18
00:06:20,813 --> 00:06:23,917
- You remember that far?
- Yeah.

19
00:06:23,951 --> 00:06:26,853
So what do you do?

20
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:29,522
I'm a fashion model.

21
00:06:29,557 --> 00:06:31,625
And a beautiful one too.

22
00:06:31,658 --> 00:06:32,960
Thanks.

23
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:36,530
Well, it was nice
talking to you,

24
00:06:36,564 --> 00:06:37,797
But I should
really get going.

25
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:40,700
I've got an audition
for a modeling job.

26
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:42,702
So it was good
talking to you.

27
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:44,572
Same here.

28
00:06:56,783 --> 00:06:59,218
Nathalie.

29
00:06:59,251 --> 00:07:02,222
Oh, hi again.

30
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,758
I was wondering if we
can keep in contact.

31
00:07:04,792 --> 00:07:06,694
Sure.

32
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:10,563
Here's my card.

33
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:12,833
- Here's mine.
- Again.

34
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:14,668
Again, it was nice
talking to you.

35
00:07:15,803 --> 00:07:17,738
- I'll see you later.
- Bye.

36
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:28,848
This morning flocks
of seagulls and crows

37
00:07:28,881 --> 00:07:31,584
Were found dead
in downtown San Jose

38
00:07:31,619 --> 00:07:33,587
And along highway 101.

39
00:07:33,621 --> 00:07:36,789
The crows and seagulls
also caused an accident

40
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:40,093
On highway 101
near the 1st street exit.

41
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:43,597
Authorities are investigating
the cause of their death.

42
00:07:43,631 --> 00:07:45,999
In other news today,
the population

43
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:48,602
Of polar bears
is declining rapidly

44
00:07:48,636 --> 00:07:51,270
Due to the melting
of sea ice in the arctic.

45
00:07:51,303 --> 00:07:53,607
As the sea ice melts,
the polar bears

46
00:07:53,641 --> 00:07:54,907
Are forced to move
farther north.

47
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:59,012
Although some have survived,
many have died from starvation

48
00:07:59,046 --> 00:08:03,116
Due to the difficulty of finding
enough food such as seals.

49
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:24,191
(Car alarm beeps)

50
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:48,215
What does it take
to win your business today?

51
00:10:48,248 --> 00:10:50,150
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

52
00:10:50,183 --> 00:10:53,253
Okay, I'll give you that
and a 50% discount.

53
00:10:53,286 --> 00:10:54,922
Can we close
the deal today?

54
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:57,825
Can I place
your order today?

55
00:10:57,858 --> 00:11:00,227
Great, thanks.
We appreciate your business.

56
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:03,696
Whoo-hoo!

57
00:11:05,298 --> 00:11:08,467
Hey, what's with
all the noise?

58
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:11,004
Caught the big fish.

59
00:11:11,038 --> 00:11:13,006
Yeah?
How big was the sale?

60
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,908
$1 million.

61
00:11:14,941 --> 00:11:17,978
- Awesome, man.
- Biggest sale of my career.

62
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,913
I'm proud of you.

63
00:12:25,377 --> 00:12:27,379
(Cell phone ringing)

64
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:32,151
Nathalie?

65
00:12:32,184 --> 00:12:33,286
Hey, Christine.
What's up?

66
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,823
I have great news for you.

67
00:12:35,856 --> 00:12:37,858
Victoria's secret
wants you

68
00:12:37,891 --> 00:12:39,927
To become their
cover girl model.

69
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,361
You're kidding.

70
00:12:41,394 --> 00:12:44,932
No no,
it's the real deal.

71
00:12:44,965 --> 00:12:48,000
That's great.
Yeah, of course I'll do it.

72
00:12:48,035 --> 00:12:49,235
Thanks for getting
me the gig.

73
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:51,872
You are welcome.

74
00:12:51,905 --> 00:12:55,107
You worked very hard.
So here's your chance
to impress them.

75
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:57,878
Congratulations again.
Okay, I'll talk to you soon.

76
00:12:57,911 --> 00:13:00,280
Okay. All right.

77
00:13:00,313 --> 00:13:02,582
Okay, I'll talk
to you later.

78
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,384
Thank you again.

79
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:07,120
All right.
Okay, bye, Christine.

80
00:13:07,154 --> 00:13:08,856
Thanks.
Okay.

81
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,295
(Cell phone rings)

82
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:54,101
- Hello?
- Nathalie?

83
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:55,267
Who is this?

84
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:58,170
It's rod.

85
00:13:58,204 --> 00:14:00,306
Oh, the guy
from the restaurant.
What's up?

86
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:04,276
Hey, it was nice running
into you at half moon bay.

87
00:14:04,311 --> 00:14:06,145
Yeah, it was nice
meeting you.

88
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:08,916
So how's your day?

89
00:14:10,217 --> 00:14:12,152
It's going well.
How's yours?

90
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:15,255
Great.
I made a big sale today.

91
00:14:15,287 --> 00:14:17,990
Good.
Fantastic.

92
00:14:18,025 --> 00:14:20,227
Thanks.

93
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:22,963
I closed a big job
offer today

94
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:24,130
With Victoria's secret,

95
00:14:24,164 --> 00:14:26,999
Wow, congratulations.

96
00:14:27,034 --> 00:14:30,002
I think you'll look great
in those lingerie.

97
00:14:30,037 --> 00:14:31,303
Thanks.

98
00:14:33,305 --> 00:14:36,409
So how about dinner
to celebrate your success?

99
00:14:36,443 --> 00:14:39,446
- That was fast.
- I know a good vietnamese
restaurant.

100
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:42,314
Sounds delicious.
I'll see you then.

101
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:50,657
Yes.

102
00:14:51,723 --> 00:14:53,593
Yes.

103
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:12,611
Man, all air.

104
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:18,250
Whoo.
This heat's killing me.

105
00:15:18,285 --> 00:15:20,220
I know, man.
What's with this weather?

106
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:21,955
A heat wave in winter?

107
00:15:21,989 --> 00:15:25,357
I don't know.
Let's call it a day.

108
00:15:39,006 --> 00:15:41,240
I met this girl nathalie
over the weekend.

109
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:43,275
Good for you.
Is she hot?

110
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:46,378
- Yeah. Fashion model.
- Lucky you, man.

111
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:48,314
Yeah, we're going out
this weekend.

112
00:15:48,347 --> 00:15:50,182
Hope you score
with her, man.

113
00:15:50,217 --> 00:15:52,318
Is that all you ever
think about... is sex?

114
00:15:53,785 --> 00:15:55,455
Anyways, we're just
gonna go to lunch.

115
00:15:55,488 --> 00:15:57,389
Just talk.
Get to know each other.

116
00:15:57,423 --> 00:15:59,993
A day without sex

117
00:16:00,027 --> 00:16:02,028
Is a day wasted, man.

118
00:16:02,062 --> 00:16:03,330
I'll let you know
how it goes.

119
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:07,300
Anyways, I heard n.C.T.
Is going to be acquired
by oracle.

120
00:16:07,334 --> 00:16:10,502
- Really?
I hope that's true, man.
- I know it's true.

121
00:16:10,537 --> 00:16:14,441
You know, if that happens,
we'll all be millionaires.

122
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:17,344
Yeah.

123
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:20,780
There was a wildfire today
in the Santa Cruz mountains.

124
00:16:20,812 --> 00:16:23,350
Dubbed the St. Martin
wildfire,

125
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:26,586
It has already burned through
30,000 acres of trees

126
00:16:26,618 --> 00:16:29,089
And has destroyed
over 100 homes.

127
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:33,093
Currently there is 0%
containment of this fire.

128
00:16:33,126 --> 00:16:35,095
However, firefighters
are hopeful

129
00:16:35,128 --> 00:16:38,065
That within the coming days
the weather will become
more favorable

130
00:16:38,098 --> 00:16:41,101
And help to extinguish
the St. Martin wildfire.

131
00:16:41,134 --> 00:16:45,404
In other news, the first
green grand prix event

132
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:47,439
Was announced today
in San Francisco.

133
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:50,309
All cars for this racing
event will be powered

134
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:53,113
With hybrid or electric
technologies.

135
00:16:53,146 --> 00:16:54,614
Parts of the streets
of San Francisco

136
00:16:54,647 --> 00:16:56,482
Will be used
as the racing course

137
00:16:56,516 --> 00:17:00,087
And the drivers will be
Hollywood celebrities.

138
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:05,191
(Doorbell rings)

139
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,829
Hi, my name
is Jerry Owens.

140
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,563
I'm from solar power
accessories.

141
00:17:11,598 --> 00:17:13,165
We have
an appointment today.

142
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,167
Oh, yeah yeah.
Come on in.

143
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:20,372
Here's that estimate
I was telling you about.

144
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:26,413
Wow, $20,000 for
a 3 kilowatt solar panel?

145
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:28,215
Yes.

146
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:29,582
Where are you
gonna put it?

147
00:17:29,616 --> 00:17:31,450
Come and I'll show you.

148
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:52,272
And that, sir,
is where we're going to
install your solar panel.

149
00:17:56,209 --> 00:17:58,278
Okay.
Huh.

150
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:00,379
$20,000, huh?

151
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:02,882
Is there any way
we can lower the price?

152
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:06,318
For you, sir,
I'll knock off $1,000.

153
00:18:06,353 --> 00:18:08,488
- $1,000, huh?
- Yeah.

154
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:12,524
- Okay, let's do it.
- All right.

155
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,347
Hi, nathalie.

156
00:18:35,382 --> 00:18:37,549
Hi.

157
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:39,219
Hi.
This is for you.

158
00:18:39,252 --> 00:18:41,420
Thanks.
That's sweet.

159
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:43,156
- You ready?
- Yeah.

160
00:19:17,324 --> 00:19:19,158
(No audible dialogue)

161
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:26,766
So why did you decide
to go into sales?

162
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:30,502
I like sales.
It fits my personality.

163
00:19:30,537 --> 00:19:32,739
I started out
as a software engineer,

164
00:19:32,772 --> 00:19:35,242
A b.S. In computer science.

165
00:19:35,275 --> 00:19:38,278
Software development
was boring for me.

166
00:19:38,311 --> 00:19:41,381
And I felt I was more of
a sales and marketing type.

167
00:19:41,413 --> 00:19:44,550
So I switched to
a high-tech sales career.

168
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:45,718
That's interesting.

169
00:19:45,752 --> 00:19:48,688
Some of my friends say
that my b.S. Degree

170
00:19:48,721 --> 00:19:51,724
Stands for bullshit because
I was too much of a salesman

171
00:19:51,758 --> 00:19:53,525
And not enough engineer.

172
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:55,328
Very funny.

173
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:59,531
I work at a start-up company
called n.C.T. Software.

174
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:01,200
Got the stock option.

175
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,404
Hopefully if the company
makes it big

176
00:20:04,437 --> 00:20:06,406
By being bought out
or goes public,

177
00:20:06,438 --> 00:20:08,608
I'll exercise
that stock option,

178
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,410
Cash out and walk away
with tons of cash.

179
00:20:11,444 --> 00:20:12,644
My silicon valley dream.

180
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:14,646
I hope that happens
for you.

181
00:20:14,681 --> 00:20:16,648
Thanks.

182
00:20:16,683 --> 00:20:19,651
Tell me about modeling.
What do you like about it?

183
00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:23,290
I love it.
It's fun and glamorous,

184
00:20:23,323 --> 00:20:24,656
But hard work.

185
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:26,358
My mother
doesn't see that though.

186
00:20:26,393 --> 00:20:28,427
She wants me to be
a real estate agent.

187
00:20:28,461 --> 00:20:29,462
It's not for me though.

188
00:20:29,495 --> 00:20:32,031
Do what you like, nathalie.
Follow your dream.

189
00:20:32,063 --> 00:20:34,401
I have every intention.

190
00:20:34,434 --> 00:20:37,304
So how come you never made
a pass at me in school?

191
00:20:37,337 --> 00:20:40,706
I should have.
I was too shy.

192
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,708
Why don't you make
a pass at me now?

193
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:45,577
I thought I already had.

194
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:49,382
So what's your plan?
Family? Kids?

195
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:51,284
Whoa, now this is
getting serious.

196
00:20:51,318 --> 00:20:52,352
I'm just curious.

197
00:20:53,786 --> 00:20:56,588
I'd probably settle down
if I met the right lady.

198
00:20:56,622 --> 00:20:59,392
- Hope you do.
- So do i.

199
00:20:59,426 --> 00:21:01,260
So who's the right lady?

200
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,863
She's beautiful,

201
00:21:03,896 --> 00:21:05,864
Kind, compassionate,

202
00:21:05,898 --> 00:21:08,601
Honest and loyal.

203
00:21:08,635 --> 00:21:10,536
- Is that all?
- Yup.

204
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:13,072
How about a nice figure?
Sexy?

205
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,374
That would certainly help.

206
00:21:15,407 --> 00:21:17,476
What do you like
to do for fun?

207
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:20,712
Watch football,
especially the 49ers.

208
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:23,482
Also a part-time
eagles fan.

209
00:21:23,516 --> 00:21:26,353
And a little exercise...
Tennis.

210
00:21:26,386 --> 00:21:28,455
How about you?

211
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:30,622
I like to go to the movies.

212
00:21:30,657 --> 00:21:33,659
And I like to hang around
with my best friends

213
00:21:33,692 --> 00:21:35,727
And go dancing at the clubs...
Clubbing.

214
00:21:35,761 --> 00:21:38,498
And I like to
spend time with Alex.

215
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:40,500
Alex?

216
00:21:40,532 --> 00:21:43,503
He's really cute.

217
00:21:43,535 --> 00:21:45,704
Who is Alex?

218
00:21:45,737 --> 00:21:48,408
And I love him to death.

219
00:21:48,441 --> 00:21:50,510
Come on, let me
see the picture.
Is he your boyfriend?

220
00:21:50,542 --> 00:21:52,412
I can't wait
for you to meet him.

221
00:21:52,445 --> 00:21:53,645
Come on, let me see it.

222
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:56,383
Come on,
let me see it.

223
00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:59,419
All right.
Meet Alex.

224
00:21:59,452 --> 00:22:01,119
You're right.
He is cute.

225
00:22:01,152 --> 00:22:03,423
- So you're a cats lover.
- Yes.

226
00:22:03,456 --> 00:22:05,658
If I could afford it,
I'd have at least 10 of them.

227
00:22:05,692 --> 00:22:08,528
- Wow, a cat zoo?
- Yup.

228
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,929
You've got to be kidding.

229
00:22:10,962 --> 00:22:12,399
Nope.

230
00:22:21,508 --> 00:22:23,510
(Birds chirping)

231
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,728
Beautiful, kind,

232
00:23:15,762 --> 00:23:18,197
Compassionate
and intelligent...

233
00:23:18,229 --> 00:23:21,032
- I hope you find her.
- I will.

234
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:09,782
- That was fun.
- We should do it again.

235
00:24:09,816 --> 00:24:11,483
I'd like to.

236
00:24:14,085 --> 00:24:15,654
Good night.
See you next week.

237
00:24:15,688 --> 00:24:17,557
Can't I come in?

238
00:24:17,589 --> 00:24:20,527
Not on the first date.

239
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,994
I'm not that kind of girl.

240
00:24:22,028 --> 00:24:24,095
Okay.

241
00:24:27,534 --> 00:24:28,867
Good night.

242
00:24:47,853 --> 00:24:50,056
- Hi, mom.
- Oh hi, honey.

243
00:24:50,089 --> 00:24:51,823
- How are you?
- Oh, good.

244
00:24:51,857 --> 00:24:53,925
I'm just fixing some lunch.
You want to stay?

245
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:55,794
I've actually
got to run soon.

246
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:57,929
But I needed to
pop in and see you.

247
00:24:57,963 --> 00:24:59,699
I'm glad you did.

248
00:24:59,731 --> 00:25:02,869
What's that smile
all about?

249
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:06,972
I don't know what
you're talking about, mom.

250
00:25:07,006 --> 00:25:10,542
Oh, come on.
I see it all over your face.

251
00:25:10,577 --> 00:25:13,779
Well, I did meet a guy.

252
00:25:13,813 --> 00:25:15,815
You're kidding.

253
00:25:15,848 --> 00:25:17,550
He is great, mom.

254
00:25:17,584 --> 00:25:19,018
You know we went
to the same high school?

255
00:25:19,051 --> 00:25:21,320
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

256
00:25:21,352 --> 00:25:24,757
We had lunch over the weekend
and it was terrific, mom.

257
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:26,058
I mean, we hit it off
right away.

258
00:25:26,092 --> 00:25:27,993
He's smart
and he's ambitious.

259
00:25:28,027 --> 00:25:30,897
And he's interested
in what I have to say

260
00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:34,866
Instead of trying to get
something from me.
So he's great.

261
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:38,003
Oh, that's fantastic.
Now what does he do
for a living?

262
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:39,739
He's a software salesman.

263
00:25:39,771 --> 00:25:42,774
Oh listen, invite him
over for dinner.

264
00:25:42,809 --> 00:25:44,342
I'd love to meet him.

265
00:25:44,375 --> 00:25:46,813
Maybe in time, mom,
when we get better acquainted.

266
00:25:46,845 --> 00:25:49,115
Well, I can understand that.

267
00:25:49,148 --> 00:25:51,584
You know, look,
keep me...

268
00:25:51,618 --> 00:25:54,654
You know, keep me informed
along the way.

269
00:25:54,687 --> 00:25:56,988
- All right.
- How's modeling going?

270
00:25:57,022 --> 00:25:59,858
It's great, mom.
I got a job with
Victoria's secret.

271
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:01,560
- (Gasps) No way!
- Yeah.

272
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,830
Are you serious?
Oh my gosh.

273
00:26:04,863 --> 00:26:08,366
Oh, honey, you know
I've always been supportive
of your modeling career.

274
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,137
It's just such
a tough business to be in.

275
00:26:11,169 --> 00:26:14,373
It is.
Thank you, mom.
I'm well on my way.

276
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:16,876
Well, listen.
If things don't work out,

277
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:21,147
It doesn't hurt to have
a secure financial husband

278
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:23,014
To support you.

279
00:26:23,048 --> 00:26:26,017
Or, you know, a real estate
career to fall back on.

280
00:26:26,051 --> 00:26:27,986
Okay, mom.
Thanks.

281
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:30,021
You told me about
a dozen times already.

282
00:26:30,055 --> 00:26:32,158
You know I always
love your advice.

283
00:26:32,191 --> 00:26:33,925
Actually, I've got
to get going.

284
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:35,927
I just wanted to drop by
and say hi to you

285
00:26:35,961 --> 00:26:38,063
And to tell you
all about my new gig.

286
00:26:38,097 --> 00:26:39,931
Well, does the gig
pay well?

287
00:26:39,965 --> 00:26:43,001
- Yes, it does.
- Ooh, that's my girl.

288
00:27:05,224 --> 00:27:07,994
(Cell phone ringing)

289
00:27:08,027 --> 00:27:09,962
I need to get the phone.

290
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:16,802
Hello?

291
00:27:16,835 --> 00:27:18,170
Hey, mai.

292
00:27:18,204 --> 00:27:20,071
Yeah?

293
00:27:20,105 --> 00:27:22,107
It's nathalie.

294
00:27:22,141 --> 00:27:23,676
Oh, hi.

295
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:24,811
What are you doing?

296
00:27:24,843 --> 00:27:27,013
What does it sound
like I'm doing?

297
00:27:27,045 --> 00:27:29,749
Rick is here
in bed with me.

298
00:27:29,781 --> 00:27:31,751
Sorry to interrupt.

299
00:27:31,783 --> 00:27:35,688
Listen, do you want to go
on a double date with me?

300
00:27:35,722 --> 00:27:37,889
I don't know.
Why?

301
00:27:37,924 --> 00:27:39,958
I just met this guy rod

302
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:42,695
And he's terrific.

303
00:27:42,729 --> 00:27:45,096
Sounds fun.
I'll let Rick know.

304
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:47,166
Great.
I'll set it up.

305
00:27:50,837 --> 00:27:52,739
Want to go on
a double date with me?

306
00:27:52,772 --> 00:27:54,105
Why not?

307
00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:57,976
My friend nathalie
just met someone named rod.

308
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:00,478
You remember,
the fashion model?

309
00:28:00,511 --> 00:28:01,680
Oh yeah.

310
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,282
With rod?

311
00:28:03,315 --> 00:28:05,718
My buddy rod.

312
00:28:05,752 --> 00:28:07,720
He was telling me
last week

313
00:28:07,754 --> 00:28:09,721
He met a fashion model
named nathalie.

314
00:28:09,756 --> 00:28:11,157
- Oh really?
- Yeah.

315
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:13,926
Man, this is gonna be fun.

316
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,266
Ladies and gentlemen,

317
00:28:20,299 --> 00:28:22,201
Please help me give
a warm welcome

318
00:28:22,234 --> 00:28:24,402
For our c.E.O.
Bill star.

319
00:28:27,239 --> 00:28:28,775
Thank you.
Good morning.

320
00:28:28,808 --> 00:28:31,811
Ladies and gentlemen,
I have some great news.

321
00:28:31,843 --> 00:28:34,747
Our board of directors has
agreed to the acquisition

322
00:28:34,781 --> 00:28:37,182
Of n.C.T. Software
by oracle corporation

323
00:28:37,216 --> 00:28:39,150
For $1 billion.

324
00:28:39,184 --> 00:28:41,220
(Cheering)

325
00:28:41,253 --> 00:28:43,389
A billion.

326
00:28:45,792 --> 00:28:47,760
A billion.

327
00:28:54,333 --> 00:28:56,903
You guys...
You guys have worked hard

328
00:28:56,936 --> 00:28:59,872
And you've all earned
your stock option.
Congratulations.

329
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:02,808
You you you you and you.

330
00:29:29,968 --> 00:29:32,504
So I guess the meeting's
adjourned.

331
00:29:35,908 --> 00:29:37,944
Congratulations.
Good work.

332
00:29:37,977 --> 00:29:39,077
You bet.
You bet.

333
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:41,848
- Congratulations.
- Way to go, bill.

334
00:29:41,881 --> 00:29:44,283
The negotiating man.
Oh yeah!

335
00:29:44,316 --> 00:29:48,821
- Thank you so much.
- What are you getting
with your money?

336
00:29:48,855 --> 00:29:51,156
(Overlapping conversations)

337
00:29:58,064 --> 00:30:00,833
So now you've got
a big payday with your
big stock option, huh?

338
00:30:00,867 --> 00:30:03,835
Yeah, I earned it.
All those big deals
I did with n.C.T.

339
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:05,838
And millions of dollars
in revenue and sales.

340
00:30:05,872 --> 00:30:08,007
Well, you've done
a great job, rod.

341
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:10,075
And we appreciate
your contribution.
Thank you.

342
00:30:10,109 --> 00:30:11,310
Thank you.

343
00:30:15,147 --> 00:30:17,216
(Laughing)

344
00:30:17,248 --> 00:30:18,985
You like it?

345
00:30:19,017 --> 00:30:22,354
I'm gonna get the real
Ferrari spider f430 soon.

346
00:30:22,388 --> 00:30:25,256
So what are you gonna do
with your newfound wealth?

347
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:28,159
I think I'm going on break.
Early retirement.

348
00:30:28,194 --> 00:30:29,896
No car?

349
00:30:31,462 --> 00:30:34,000
Well, with that new
fashion model chick

350
00:30:34,033 --> 00:30:36,368
You might want to impress
her with a Ferrari.

351
00:30:36,402 --> 00:30:38,971
I don't think
she's materialistic.

352
00:30:39,005 --> 00:30:41,908
When are you
gonna grow up, man?

353
00:30:41,941 --> 00:30:43,409
Chicks love cars.

354
00:30:43,442 --> 00:30:45,143
If you want to get
into their pants,

355
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:47,413
You'd better have
a nice hot Ferrari.

356
00:30:47,446 --> 00:30:49,280
She's my hot Ferrari.

357
00:30:49,314 --> 00:30:52,083
Besides, I love my mustang,
which is a plug-in hybrid.

358
00:30:52,118 --> 00:30:54,085
It gets 100mpg.

359
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,087
Anyways,
I'm thinking about

360
00:30:56,122 --> 00:30:58,156
Opening up a green
tech company.

361
00:30:58,189 --> 00:31:00,158
Really?

362
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:01,860
Oh, by the way,

363
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,096
I know your
girlfriend nathalie.

364
00:31:04,129 --> 00:31:06,432
She's my girlfriend's
best friend.

365
00:31:06,464 --> 00:31:08,400
- Huh, small world.
- Yeah.

366
00:31:08,434 --> 00:31:11,670
And they're planning on setting
us up for a double date.

367
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:14,340
- It's gonna be fun.
- Yeah.

368
00:31:27,053 --> 00:31:29,255
(Chatting quietly)

369
00:31:33,158 --> 00:31:36,028
Man, that was a good movie...
"an inconvenient truth."

370
00:31:36,062 --> 00:31:37,463
That is it.

371
00:31:37,496 --> 00:31:40,231
I'm getting myself a car
that's environmentally friendly.

372
00:31:40,265 --> 00:31:42,333
- Yeah.
- Good, you're finally
listening to me.

373
00:31:42,367 --> 00:31:44,103
That's right.

374
00:31:45,336 --> 00:31:48,440
Hey, mai and I got
to get back to work.

375
00:31:48,474 --> 00:31:50,476
So, uh...
Just trot off.

376
00:31:50,509 --> 00:31:52,444
Work?

377
00:31:52,478 --> 00:31:57,016
Yeah, you know,
sensual work.

378
00:31:57,049 --> 00:31:59,284
Oh, I see.
Understood.

379
00:31:59,317 --> 00:32:01,219
Well, you guys have
a good time.

380
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:02,921
Yeah, all right.

381
00:32:23,509 --> 00:32:27,046
With mass solar's nano-based
solar panels,

382
00:32:27,078 --> 00:32:30,316
They cost the manufacturer
for one watt of electricity 10¢.

383
00:32:30,348 --> 00:32:32,484
That's a fraction
of the cost

384
00:32:32,518 --> 00:32:34,486
Of a recurring silicon-based
solar panel

385
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:37,355
Which is $4 per watt.

386
00:32:37,388 --> 00:32:41,027
So a 3-kilowatt
mass solar nano-based

387
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:43,996
Solar-powered system
would probably cost around

388
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:45,363
$300-$500.

389
00:32:45,396 --> 00:32:49,300
At this price everyone
can afford solar power

390
00:32:49,334 --> 00:32:51,170
For their home
or businesses.

391
00:32:51,202 --> 00:32:53,438
With these panels,

392
00:32:53,472 --> 00:32:57,109
Solar power will be
available and affordable
for everyone.

393
00:32:57,143 --> 00:32:59,578
No need for leasing
or financing

394
00:32:59,611 --> 00:33:03,082
An expensive $20,000
silicon-based solar panel.

395
00:33:03,115 --> 00:33:04,782
Is there a patent?

396
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:08,187
Yes, mass solar
owns the patent to
this technology.

397
00:33:08,219 --> 00:33:11,589
Good.
Who are your competitors?

398
00:33:11,622 --> 00:33:15,526
Companies like sun power,
silicon valley solar.

399
00:33:15,561 --> 00:33:17,528
But these companies'
solar panels

400
00:33:17,563 --> 00:33:19,798
Are based on
silicon technology,

401
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:22,133
Which is very expensive
to manufacture.

402
00:33:22,168 --> 00:33:24,335
That's why
it's for $4 per watt.

403
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:28,174
On the other hand,
mass solar's manufacturing
process

404
00:33:28,206 --> 00:33:30,441
Is simple,
it's low cost

405
00:33:30,475 --> 00:33:32,210
And it uses nanotechnology.

406
00:33:32,244 --> 00:33:35,581
That's why we're able to
deliver 10¢ per watt.

407
00:33:37,382 --> 00:33:41,019
So how much funding
are you requesting?

408
00:33:42,121 --> 00:33:43,689
$10 million.

409
00:33:47,325 --> 00:33:50,696
Guys, this is revolutionary
green tech.

410
00:33:53,264 --> 00:33:57,303
Contingent upon agreement
on our terms sheets,

411
00:33:57,335 --> 00:33:59,705
- we're going to fund you.
- Awesome.

412
00:35:39,705 --> 00:35:42,873
- Oh, lovers on the moon.
- Yeah.

413
00:36:23,782 --> 00:36:26,418
(No audible dialogue)

414
00:36:36,594 --> 00:36:38,629
Oh, look how cute.

415
00:37:20,671 --> 00:37:22,673
The sea is so beautiful.

416
00:37:26,711 --> 00:37:28,579
Yes, it is.

417
00:37:28,614 --> 00:37:31,049
You know, all life
came from the sea.

418
00:37:31,081 --> 00:37:34,052
I mean, look at us.
We're made of water.
So...

419
00:37:34,084 --> 00:37:36,888
So what is
your ideal man?

420
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:39,791
Well, for one thing,

421
00:37:39,825 --> 00:37:42,059
He has to have a lot of
stock options invested.

422
00:37:42,092 --> 00:37:44,363
(Chuckles)
At least you're honest.

423
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:49,468
He has to be kind,
honest,

424
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:53,372
Successful,
ambitious,

425
00:37:53,405 --> 00:37:54,672
And opportunistic.

426
00:37:54,705 --> 00:37:57,443
- Is that all?
- Yup.

427
00:37:57,476 --> 00:37:59,811
So do you have, like,
a backup plan,

428
00:37:59,845 --> 00:38:02,079
You know, if your modeling
career doesn't work out?

429
00:38:02,112 --> 00:38:03,814
Not really.

430
00:38:03,849 --> 00:38:06,451
I figure if I don't make
it big by the time I'm 30,

431
00:38:06,485 --> 00:38:08,820
I figure I'll just
take it from there.

432
00:38:08,854 --> 00:38:10,821
You should have
a plan b now.

433
00:38:10,856 --> 00:38:12,423
I always do.

434
00:38:12,457 --> 00:38:14,593
I mean, look at me.

435
00:38:14,626 --> 00:38:16,695
I started out as
a software engineer

436
00:38:16,727 --> 00:38:18,729
And ended up a salesman.

437
00:38:18,763 --> 00:38:21,333
You sound like my mother.

438
00:38:21,367 --> 00:38:22,733
(Laughs)

439
00:38:22,767 --> 00:38:25,103
Good advice though.

440
00:38:25,135 --> 00:38:28,407
Who knows? Maybe I will
consider a career
in real estate,

441
00:38:28,439 --> 00:38:30,542
Or even becoming a wife

442
00:38:30,575 --> 00:38:32,710
Of a successful
entrepreneur.

443
00:38:44,423 --> 00:38:46,091
Look at these birds.

444
00:38:46,123 --> 00:38:47,893
Stop, don't touch it.

445
00:38:47,926 --> 00:38:49,828
It may be infectious.

446
00:38:49,861 --> 00:38:52,531
(Weeps, sniffles)

447
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:07,746
(Doorbell rings)

448
00:39:09,848 --> 00:39:11,683
- Oh hi.
- Hi, mom.

449
00:39:11,717 --> 00:39:13,551
- How are you?
- Good good.

450
00:39:13,585 --> 00:39:14,853
- This is rod.
- Hi, rod.

451
00:39:14,885 --> 00:39:16,655
- So nice to meet you.
- Likewise.

452
00:39:16,688 --> 00:39:19,157
Come on in, you guys.
Good to see you, honey.

453
00:39:19,189 --> 00:39:21,427
Come on in.

454
00:39:23,595 --> 00:39:25,664
Rod, nat tells me

455
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:28,566
That you are a very
successful salesman.

456
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,501
She did, huh?

457
00:39:30,536 --> 00:39:32,871
I am very passionate
about my career.

458
00:39:32,904 --> 00:39:35,773
So nathalie tells me
you recently retired.

459
00:39:35,806 --> 00:39:37,675
Yes, I did.

460
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:40,579
And she mentioned that you were
gonna take an early retirement.

461
00:39:40,611 --> 00:39:42,747
Yeah, a few months.

462
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,715
Just taking a little break.

463
00:39:44,749 --> 00:39:46,617
So are you enjoying
your retirement?

464
00:39:46,652 --> 00:39:48,954
I love the retirement.

465
00:39:48,987 --> 00:39:51,722
I was a jeweler
for 30 years.

466
00:39:51,756 --> 00:39:54,792
And sometimes I miss not
going into the jewelry store,

467
00:39:54,825 --> 00:39:57,795
But, you know,
I really like retirement.

468
00:39:57,828 --> 00:40:00,599
I like to travel.
I like to cruise.

469
00:40:00,631 --> 00:40:03,668
And I enjoy
watching television.

470
00:40:03,702 --> 00:40:05,871
And my biggest thing

471
00:40:05,904 --> 00:40:07,806
Is I love to watch nat

472
00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:10,575
And work with her
in her modeling career.

473
00:40:10,608 --> 00:40:14,178
Wow, nathalie's
a lucky person to have
such a loving mother.

474
00:40:14,212 --> 00:40:17,515
Oh, thanks, rod.
I appreciate that.

475
00:40:17,548 --> 00:40:20,018
My big thing is to make sure
that she's happy

476
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:23,789
And successful in whatever
she chooses to do.

477
00:40:23,821 --> 00:40:26,056
Thanks, mom.

478
00:40:51,082 --> 00:40:53,818
Hello.
Here's your drinks.

479
00:40:53,851 --> 00:40:56,021
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

480
00:40:56,054 --> 00:40:57,556
Can I get you
anything else?

481
00:40:57,589 --> 00:41:00,858
We're still
looking at the menu.
Thank you.

482
00:41:00,891 --> 00:41:02,460
- Hope you enjoy.
- Thanks.

483
00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:06,697
I really enjoyed
meeting your mother.

484
00:41:06,732 --> 00:41:08,699
She seemed
to really like you.

485
00:41:09,735 --> 00:41:12,804
I was so lonely
until now.

486
00:41:12,838 --> 00:41:15,807
So do you think
I'm that right lady?

487
00:41:15,841 --> 00:41:17,675
Maybe.

488
00:41:17,709 --> 00:41:19,243
Do you think
I'm the ideal man?

489
00:41:19,277 --> 00:41:21,146
Perhaps.

490
00:41:22,613 --> 00:41:24,583
You know, rod,
I was just kidding

491
00:41:24,615 --> 00:41:26,585
About the stock options,

492
00:41:26,617 --> 00:41:29,687
Shopping and money
and all that.

493
00:41:29,721 --> 00:41:30,921
All I want is you.

494
00:41:30,955 --> 00:41:32,623
Are you sure?

495
00:41:32,658 --> 00:41:35,260
Definitely.

496
00:41:35,292 --> 00:41:39,598
Guys are usually just
into me for my looks
and sex.

497
00:41:39,631 --> 00:41:41,700
But you're not
like that.

498
00:41:41,732 --> 00:41:44,002
You're a real gentleman.

499
00:41:44,035 --> 00:41:46,971
I feel like you
really respect me.

500
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:49,107
That means a lot to me.

501
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:51,876
I feel like I could be
with you for a long time.

502
00:41:51,909 --> 00:41:54,512
Then I'm one lucky man.

503
00:41:57,948 --> 00:42:00,018
I think my luck has changed
since I met you.

504
00:42:00,051 --> 00:42:01,752
Really?
Why's that?

505
00:42:01,787 --> 00:42:04,623
Last week the company n.C.T.
Software that I work for

506
00:42:04,656 --> 00:42:07,324
Was bought for $1 billion
by oracle corporation.

507
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:10,728
And this week my start-up
company that I founded,

508
00:42:10,762 --> 00:42:13,031
Mass solar,
got funded $10 million

509
00:42:13,063 --> 00:42:14,699
By evergreen capital.

510
00:42:14,732 --> 00:42:15,934
Wow.

511
00:42:15,966 --> 00:42:18,669
You said that might happen.
Congratulations.

512
00:42:18,704 --> 00:42:20,138
Thanks.

546
00:43:52,029 --> 00:43:54,766

You are forever

557
00:44:21,058 --> 00:44:22,993
Thank you.

558
00:44:38,108 --> 00:44:39,878
So?

559
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:42,046
What do you think?

560
00:44:55,293 --> 00:44:58,162
You look divine.

561
00:47:01,218 --> 00:47:03,854
(Birds screeching)

562
00:47:06,457 --> 00:47:08,826
(Bird roaring)

563
00:47:20,906 --> 00:47:23,074
(Birds screeching)

564
00:47:33,451 --> 00:47:35,620
(Birds screeching)

565
00:47:58,076 --> 00:47:59,544
Rod.

566
00:48:01,245 --> 00:48:02,880
What is it?

567
00:48:07,184 --> 00:48:09,053
I think they're eagles.

568
00:48:09,087 --> 00:48:11,155
What in the world?

569
00:48:19,729 --> 00:48:21,199
Battery is dead.

570
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:24,334
What's going on?
Can they get in?

571
00:48:27,005 --> 00:48:29,274
Not for the moment.

572
00:48:34,111 --> 00:48:35,981
(Screeching)

573
00:48:38,715 --> 00:48:40,217
(Thumps)

574
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:42,087
(Thumping)

575
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:43,387
Rod, they're breaking in
through the window.

576
00:48:43,421 --> 00:48:45,355
Hurry, let's barricade it
with the bed.

577
00:48:45,389 --> 00:48:46,656
Hurry!

578
00:49:20,558 --> 00:49:22,693
That should hold 'em.

579
00:49:30,201 --> 00:49:31,601
(Screeching stops)

580
00:49:36,041 --> 00:49:37,242
I think they're gone.

581
00:49:38,408 --> 00:49:41,445
Well, do you know
why they stopped?

582
00:49:41,479 --> 00:49:44,615
I don't know.
Maybe they got tired.

583
00:49:46,184 --> 00:49:48,019
Why would birds do
something like that?

584
00:49:48,053 --> 00:49:51,256
I mean, why would
they just attack?

585
00:49:51,288 --> 00:49:53,558
I don't know.

586
00:50:05,070 --> 00:50:07,205
Anybody in here?

587
00:50:07,237 --> 00:50:08,706
Come on.

588
00:50:11,242 --> 00:50:12,776
- Name's rod.
- Ramsey.

589
00:50:12,810 --> 00:50:14,245
- This is nathalie.
- Nice to meet you.

590
00:50:14,278 --> 00:50:15,779
- My girlfriend Becky.
- Hi.

591
00:50:15,813 --> 00:50:18,182
- You guys okay?
- Yeah, we're all right.

592
00:50:18,215 --> 00:50:20,385
- I guess.
- Man, those birds were
attacking all night

593
00:50:20,417 --> 00:50:22,087
Then they just
suddenly stopped.

594
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:24,421
We'd try to drive away but
I can't find my car keys.

595
00:50:24,454 --> 00:50:26,456
- I lost them somewhere.
- They were attacking us too.

596
00:50:26,490 --> 00:50:28,326
We have a van outside.

597
00:50:28,358 --> 00:50:29,827
- You guys are more
than welcome to come.
- Yeah, come with us.

598
00:50:29,859 --> 00:50:30,761
Thank you.

599
00:50:30,794 --> 00:50:33,064
We need something
to protect ourselves.

600
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:39,304
Use these.

601
00:50:40,404 --> 00:50:42,439
Here you go.
All right.

602
00:50:42,472 --> 00:50:44,809
Let's all get our backs
to each other.

603
00:50:44,841 --> 00:50:47,377
That we can see the birds
coming from every direction.

604
00:50:47,411 --> 00:50:49,379
- Okay.
- Just like this.

605
00:50:49,413 --> 00:50:51,116
- (Exhales)
- All right, ready?

606
00:50:51,149 --> 00:50:52,583
- Rod: Let's go.
- Let's go.

607
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:05,462
Here they come!

608
00:51:05,495 --> 00:51:07,664
(Screeching)

609
00:51:13,571 --> 00:51:15,406
Open the door.

610
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:17,642
Becky:
The door's stuck.

611
00:51:17,674 --> 00:51:20,111
The door's stuck.

612
00:51:25,549 --> 00:51:27,385
Hurry up.

613
00:51:29,286 --> 00:51:31,189
I can't hurry up.

614
00:51:57,648 --> 00:51:59,416
Damn birds
scratched me.

615
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:01,719
Becky, hand me a gun.
Rod, drive.

616
00:52:08,292 --> 00:52:10,261
(Gunfire)

617
00:52:12,329 --> 00:52:14,331
Here, rod.
Take a pistol.

618
00:52:16,601 --> 00:52:18,268
Let's go.

619
00:52:20,705 --> 00:52:22,640
(Gunfire)

620
00:52:27,678 --> 00:52:30,215
Hey, there's dead people
on the side of the road.

621
00:52:30,248 --> 00:52:32,383
Let's go see
if there's any survivors.

622
00:52:32,416 --> 00:52:34,219
Okay.

623
00:52:49,667 --> 00:52:52,303
Becky, cover us.

624
00:52:52,337 --> 00:52:54,672
I'll check out this car,
you check out the other.

625
00:52:54,705 --> 00:52:56,307
Okay.

626
00:53:04,782 --> 00:53:06,583
They're dead.

627
00:53:06,616 --> 00:53:08,918
(Girl crying)

628
00:53:13,323 --> 00:53:16,293
Come on, honey.
Come over here.

629
00:53:16,326 --> 00:53:17,762
Come out from under the car.
Come on.

630
00:53:17,794 --> 00:53:21,598
No, I don't want to come out.
The birds will bite me.

631
00:53:21,631 --> 00:53:23,333
No they won't.
Come on.

632
00:53:23,368 --> 00:53:24,702
I'll protect you,
I promise.

633
00:53:24,735 --> 00:53:28,306
I'm scared.
They killed my mommy.

634
00:53:28,338 --> 00:53:31,641
(Crying)
They killed my mommy.

635
00:53:36,012 --> 00:53:37,782
(Birds screeching)

636
00:53:39,048 --> 00:53:42,487
- It's the birds!
- (Gunfire)

637
00:53:47,425 --> 00:53:48,993
Boy:
Help!

638
00:53:49,025 --> 00:53:50,594
Help!

639
00:53:50,627 --> 00:53:52,430
Let me out!

640
00:53:59,603 --> 00:54:02,572
- Help!
- Run for it.
Let's go.

641
00:54:02,606 --> 00:54:04,375
Help!

642
00:54:10,781 --> 00:54:13,651
Come on,
let's go.

643
00:54:13,683 --> 00:54:15,553
Come on.

644
00:54:15,586 --> 00:54:17,787
- (Gunfire)
- Come on!

645
00:54:21,591 --> 00:54:23,828
- Let's go.
- Come on.

646
00:54:41,479 --> 00:54:43,381
(Gunfire)

647
00:55:11,508 --> 00:55:13,378
What's your name,
sweetie?

648
00:55:13,410 --> 00:55:15,078
Susan.

649
00:55:17,815 --> 00:55:19,884
We're gonna make this
feel all better.

650
00:55:19,917 --> 00:55:21,451
Thank you.

651
00:55:22,752 --> 00:55:24,622
Thanks.

652
00:55:25,856 --> 00:55:27,657
Thank you.

653
00:55:31,396 --> 00:55:33,663
- Oh, you want to play?
- Okay.

654
00:55:40,737 --> 00:55:44,375
I'm hungry.
I've been under the car
for a long time.

655
00:55:44,409 --> 00:55:45,742
Yeah, me too.

656
00:55:45,775 --> 00:55:47,677
I'm starving.

657
00:55:50,881 --> 00:55:52,649
Hey, the kids
are getting hungry.

658
00:55:52,682 --> 00:55:54,684
We should stop and get
some food for them.

659
00:55:54,718 --> 00:55:56,653
And some for us too.

660
00:55:56,686 --> 00:55:59,123
There's a convenience store
close by.

661
00:55:59,155 --> 00:56:01,090
We'll stop there.

662
00:56:10,467 --> 00:56:13,069
Becky, watch Tony while
he sleeps, okay?

663
00:56:26,650 --> 00:56:28,785
I'll stand guard.
You go get food and water.

664
00:56:28,818 --> 00:56:30,421
Okay.

665
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:37,895
You want to get
some candy?

666
00:56:37,928 --> 00:56:39,930
Okay.

667
00:56:39,964 --> 00:56:43,033
- Get some for Tony too.
- Okay.

668
00:57:46,731 --> 00:57:48,666
(Birds screeching)

669
00:57:54,639 --> 00:57:56,272
Let's go, guys.
The eagles are coming.

670
00:57:56,305 --> 00:57:58,543
Come on, guys.
Let's go.

671
00:57:58,576 --> 00:58:00,745
The eagles are attacking.
Come on, let's go.

672
00:58:06,916 --> 00:58:08,918
(Gunfire)

673
00:59:29,133 --> 00:59:31,802
Hey, look.
There's an old guy
on the bridge.

674
00:59:42,780 --> 00:59:45,115
Hey, mister.
What the hell are you
doing out here?

675
00:59:45,149 --> 00:59:47,718
Hey hey!
Stand back!

676
00:59:47,752 --> 00:59:50,954
These birds are contagious.
Now go away.

677
00:59:54,057 --> 00:59:56,360
Hey, I thought I told
you to stand back.

678
00:59:56,392 --> 00:59:58,095
These birds are
contaminated.

679
00:59:58,128 --> 01:00:00,097
They have bird flu virus.

680
01:00:00,130 --> 01:00:01,766
Now go away.

681
01:00:01,799 --> 01:00:05,001
Could we just talk about it
at the picnic area?

682
01:00:05,035 --> 01:00:07,904
You want to talk?
Okay.

683
01:00:07,938 --> 01:00:09,940
All right.
We'll talk.

684
01:00:24,421 --> 01:00:26,956
(Kids laughing)

685
01:00:26,991 --> 01:00:28,825
Guys, this is
Dr. Jones.

686
01:00:28,859 --> 01:00:30,026
How do you do?

687
01:00:30,059 --> 01:00:32,162
- Hi.
- Hi.

688
01:00:32,196 --> 01:00:36,734
Sir, don't you know
that these birds are
attacking people?

689
01:00:36,767 --> 01:00:38,034
- These birds?
- Yes.

690
01:00:38,067 --> 01:00:41,171
No way.
They're dead from
the bird flu virus.

691
01:00:41,205 --> 01:00:43,407
- Bird flu virus?
- How do you know this?

692
01:00:43,439 --> 01:00:45,441
I just tested their blood.

693
01:00:45,474 --> 01:00:47,177
Then why are they
attacking us?

694
01:00:47,211 --> 01:00:49,747
I don't know.

695
01:00:49,780 --> 01:00:53,049
But what I do know
is global warming is
causing viral diseases

696
01:00:53,082 --> 01:00:56,721
Such as bird flu,
west nile virus and SARS.

697
01:00:56,754 --> 01:00:57,855
So what are you saying?

698
01:00:57,887 --> 01:01:00,424
That global warming is causing
these birds to attack?

699
01:01:00,456 --> 01:01:02,058
No.

700
01:01:02,091 --> 01:01:05,061
I'm a scientist...
An ornithologist.

701
01:01:05,095 --> 01:01:08,898
I can't state any scientific
fact without evidence.

702
01:01:08,933 --> 01:01:11,736
But there is scientific
evidence to show

703
01:01:11,768 --> 01:01:13,770
That because of our
burning of fossil fuels

704
01:01:13,803 --> 01:01:15,072
And creating
greenhouse gasses

705
01:01:15,104 --> 01:01:17,074
Which is causing
global warming,

706
01:01:17,106 --> 01:01:19,076
It's raising the temperature
of the seas

707
01:01:19,108 --> 01:01:21,746
And species like
the krill are dying.

708
01:01:21,779 --> 01:01:25,182
So many bird species
can't find food

709
01:01:25,215 --> 01:01:26,883
Like the neritic
krill.

710
01:01:26,917 --> 01:01:29,018
They eventually
starve and die,

711
01:01:29,053 --> 01:01:30,921
Wash up on the shore.

712
01:01:30,954 --> 01:01:33,122
There's also evidence
that global warming

713
01:01:33,156 --> 01:01:35,960
Is interrupting the birth,
mating and migration cycles

714
01:01:35,992 --> 01:01:37,828
Of many species.

715
01:01:37,862 --> 01:01:40,029
In fact,
in the last few years

716
01:01:40,063 --> 01:01:42,867
40 species have become extinct
because of global warming.

717
01:01:44,268 --> 01:01:47,003
However, there is
interesting research

718
01:01:47,036 --> 01:01:49,273
That in prehistoric times

719
01:01:49,306 --> 01:01:51,140
Birds did attack cavemen.

720
01:01:51,174 --> 01:01:54,845
They used to claw
at their eyes and skull.

721
01:01:54,879 --> 01:01:57,513
They'd either leave them
for dead or then come back

722
01:01:57,546 --> 01:01:59,115
Because their injuries
were so bad

723
01:01:59,148 --> 01:02:01,718
And finally
finish off the kill.

724
01:02:05,054 --> 01:02:06,990
If they attack me,

725
01:02:07,023 --> 01:02:09,493
I've got a little
present for them.

726
01:02:09,525 --> 01:02:12,261
Well, you certainly know
a lot about birds.

727
01:02:13,830 --> 01:02:16,165
Well, I should.
I'm an ornithologist.

728
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:19,002
I study and work with birds
for a living.

729
01:02:19,036 --> 01:02:21,004
You should come with us.
It's safer.

730
01:02:21,038 --> 01:02:23,774
I don't need protection.
I can take care of myself.

731
01:02:23,808 --> 01:02:26,009
I've got my truck
and my trailer.

732
01:02:26,043 --> 01:02:30,179
Besides, I'm not worried
about the blackbirds.

733
01:02:30,213 --> 01:02:32,817
They're not
the dangerous animal.

734
01:02:32,850 --> 01:02:35,184
It's the human species
that's the dangerous

735
01:02:35,218 --> 01:02:37,553
And menacing
and terrifying animal.

736
01:02:37,586 --> 01:02:40,858
Because of his fossil fuel
related activities,

737
01:02:40,891 --> 01:02:42,225
He's causing global warming.

738
01:02:42,259 --> 01:02:44,528
It's killing life
and earth itself.

739
01:02:45,995 --> 01:02:47,932
It's the human species

740
01:02:47,965 --> 01:02:50,835
That needs to quit playing
cowboy with nature.

741
01:02:52,235 --> 01:02:55,071
We must act
more like astronauts,

742
01:02:55,104 --> 01:02:59,075
Spacemen taking care of
our spaceship earth.

743
01:03:02,178 --> 01:03:03,780
Well, nice meeting you.

744
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:06,215
Good luck.

745
01:03:19,163 --> 01:03:20,930
Where's Becky?

746
01:03:20,965 --> 01:03:23,066
She's taking a shit.

747
01:03:23,100 --> 01:03:24,969
Nathalie's watching her back.

748
01:03:25,001 --> 01:03:26,603
You're pretty
good at shooting.

749
01:03:26,635 --> 01:03:28,906
How come you're still
not in the marines?

750
01:03:28,938 --> 01:03:32,042
I just got tired of all
the fucking killing in Iraq.

751
01:03:34,178 --> 01:03:36,346
Why can't we just give
peace a chance?

752
01:03:45,254 --> 01:03:47,123
Right there.

753
01:03:47,156 --> 01:03:49,526
- I'll cover you.
- Okay.

754
01:03:54,932 --> 01:03:57,467
- (Screeches)
- (Screams)

755

(Gunshots)

756
01:04:05,374 --> 01:04:08,144
Oh my God,
she's dead.

757
01:04:12,316 --> 01:04:14,351
Rod!

758
01:04:14,383 --> 01:04:17,286
Rod!
Ramsey!

759
01:04:17,321 --> 01:04:19,323
She's dead.

760
01:04:19,356 --> 01:04:21,358
I couldn't do anything.
She's dead.

761
01:04:21,391 --> 01:04:23,192
What do you mean
she's dead?

762
01:04:49,419 --> 01:04:52,022
- (Birds screeching)
- Let's go!

763
01:04:52,056 --> 01:04:54,257
(Gunfire)

764
01:04:57,326 --> 01:04:59,563
Come on,
let's go!

765
01:05:31,394 --> 01:05:33,463
The eagles killed Becky.

766
01:05:36,100 --> 01:05:37,968
Fucking killed Becky.

767
01:05:41,404 --> 01:05:42,606
I'm sorry.

768
01:05:44,474 --> 01:05:47,111
I'm sorry, Ramsey.

769
01:05:47,144 --> 01:05:50,179
They got to her before
I got a chance.

770
01:06:03,027 --> 01:06:03,960
I don't know what to do.

771
01:06:16,239 --> 01:06:19,075
Hey, those people
on that bus are being
attacked by those birds.

772
01:06:19,108 --> 01:06:21,444
- (Screeching)
- (People screaming)

773
01:06:24,180 --> 01:06:26,350
- Let's go save them.
- We can't. We have no room.

774
01:06:26,382 --> 01:06:29,086
- It's full in here.
- They killed Becky.

775
01:06:29,118 --> 01:06:31,420
What if it was nathalie?

776
01:06:38,128 --> 01:06:40,697
- (Birds screeching)
- (Gunfire)

777
01:06:42,266 --> 01:06:44,467
Please help me!

778
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:54,243
Help!

779
01:06:54,278 --> 01:06:56,613
Come on.
I've got to get
out of here.

780
01:07:05,455 --> 01:07:08,491
Ramsey:
Come on, guys, let's go.
The birds are gone.

781
01:07:08,525 --> 01:07:10,193
No they're not.
They're not gone.

782
01:07:10,227 --> 01:07:11,827
They're gonna kill us
if we go out there.

783
01:07:11,861 --> 01:07:13,296
Come on, let's go.

784
01:07:13,330 --> 01:07:15,564
I don't want to.
They'll kill us.

785
01:07:15,599 --> 01:07:17,534
Rod, I'm gonna go
get those people.

786
01:07:17,566 --> 01:07:19,568
- Cover me, okay?
- Okay.

787
01:07:21,504 --> 01:07:23,773
(People screaming)

788
01:07:27,544 --> 01:07:29,146
- Come on, let's go.
- No.

789
01:07:29,178 --> 01:07:31,180
- Come on.
Let's go.
- No.

790
01:07:31,215 --> 01:07:33,249
- Come on.
- No.

791
01:07:33,283 --> 01:07:34,817
Let's go.

792
01:07:38,454 --> 01:07:41,390
Help me! No!
I don't want to go!

793
01:07:41,424 --> 01:07:43,227
- Come on.
- No no!

794
01:07:43,260 --> 01:07:45,461
- I don't want to go!
- Let's go.

795
01:07:48,864 --> 01:07:51,101
- No!
- Don't make me
go out there!

796
01:07:54,204 --> 01:07:57,073
- Follow me.
- (Gunshots)

01:09:06,243 --> 01:09:07,943
I'm going out there
to save them.

804
01:09:07,977 --> 01:09:09,913
Don't go.
If you go out there
you'll die.

805
01:09:09,945 --> 01:09:11,515
They're dead already.

806
01:09:11,548 --> 01:09:13,182
Yeah, you're right.

807
01:09:13,217 --> 01:09:14,884
Let's get the hell
out of here.

808
01:09:57,361 --> 01:09:59,363
Hi.
The eagles killed
our friends.

809
01:09:59,396 --> 01:10:00,996
Do you have a phone I can
use to call the police?

810
01:10:01,029 --> 01:10:03,767
No, I'm sorry.
All phones from
the eagle attack...

811
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:06,002
All phones
are dead up here.

812
01:10:06,035 --> 01:10:08,572
Really?
Damn it.

813
01:10:08,605 --> 01:10:10,407
Well, we need some gas.

814
01:10:10,439 --> 01:10:12,408
Well, you know,
from the eagle attack

815
01:10:12,442 --> 01:10:13,777
We are short on gas.

816
01:10:13,809 --> 01:10:15,978
But it's $100 a gallon
if you want.

817
01:10:16,012 --> 01:10:18,381
What? $100?
That's outrageous.

818
01:10:18,414 --> 01:10:20,584
Well, either you
take it or leave it.

819
01:10:20,616 --> 01:10:22,752
I have only a few
gallons left only.

820
01:10:22,786 --> 01:10:26,590
It's a rip-off.
Fine.

821
01:10:29,625 --> 01:10:32,262
Thank you.

822
01:10:32,296 --> 01:10:34,731
Tony, Susan, can you guys go
get some water over there?

823
01:10:34,764 --> 01:10:36,599
Then you can go get
candy for yourselves.

824
01:10:36,632 --> 01:10:38,435
- Yay.
- Okay.

825
01:11:12,602 --> 01:11:14,870
(Screeching)

826
01:11:18,742 --> 01:11:20,476
(Gunshots)

827
01:11:35,724 --> 01:11:37,593
Hey, look at
that man up there.

828
01:11:37,626 --> 01:11:39,094
We should stop
and help him.

829
01:11:39,127 --> 01:11:40,864
Okay.

830
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:06,489
- Howdy.
- Hi.

831
01:12:06,523 --> 01:12:08,424
Can you sell me some gas
for my truck?

832
01:12:08,458 --> 01:12:10,559
We only have a few gallons
and we need them.

833
01:12:10,594 --> 01:12:12,829
We just bought some for $100
a gallon down the street.

834
01:12:12,861 --> 01:12:16,432
$100 a gallon?
I've only got 50
in my wallet.

835
01:12:16,465 --> 01:12:18,835
- We can give you a ride.
- Oh, no thanks.

836
01:12:18,867 --> 01:12:21,405
Sorry, but we need it.

837
01:12:23,171 --> 01:12:25,642
- You're gonna sell
me some gas now.
- Whoa, take it easy.

838
01:12:25,674 --> 01:12:27,911
Take it easy.
I've got an extra tank
in the back.

839
01:12:27,944 --> 01:12:29,111
Good.
Get it.

840
01:12:58,475 --> 01:13:00,477
(Screeches)

841
01:13:21,797 --> 01:13:23,900
Rod, let's get
out of here.

842
01:13:29,237 --> 01:13:31,140
(Engine starts)

843
01:14:06,776 --> 01:14:08,812
(Engine stops)

844
01:14:08,845 --> 01:14:11,747
There's a creek over there.
We can get some fresh water.

845
01:14:11,781 --> 01:14:13,016
Okay.

846
01:14:42,979 --> 01:14:44,847
(Water flowing)

847
01:15:22,752 --> 01:15:24,688
Who's there?
Who's there?

848
01:15:24,720 --> 01:15:25,889
Come out or I'll shoot.

849
01:15:25,921 --> 01:15:29,058
Don't shoot.
Peace, man.

850
01:15:29,092 --> 01:15:30,760
Come down here.

851
01:15:52,781 --> 01:15:55,051
Why were you hiding
in the trees?

852
01:15:55,084 --> 01:15:57,120
This is my home.
I live here.

853
01:15:57,153 --> 01:15:59,122
That's my house.

854
01:16:05,695 --> 01:16:07,830
You live in a tree?

855
01:16:08,932 --> 01:16:10,700
Sure do.

856
01:16:10,733 --> 01:16:14,070
So you're a tree hugger?

857
01:16:14,102 --> 01:16:16,705
You could put it that way.

858
01:16:16,739 --> 01:16:18,642
I love trees.
They're my family.

859
01:16:18,674 --> 01:16:22,378
I look out for them
and protect these
precious redwoods.

860
01:16:22,410 --> 01:16:25,682
So you can play
in your tree house?

861
01:16:25,714 --> 01:16:27,751
Sure.

862
01:16:27,783 --> 01:16:29,753
Yes, that'll be fun!

863
01:16:29,785 --> 01:16:32,121
No way, it's too dangerous.
The eagles might come there.

864
01:16:32,155 --> 01:16:35,324
Oh, they won't.
You're very safe here
in the forest.

865
01:16:35,357 --> 01:16:37,325
Haven't you noticed
those eagles

866
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:40,328
Seem to be going after people
in their cars and gas stations?

867
01:16:40,363 --> 01:16:43,031
Besides, it's not the eagles
I worry about.

868
01:16:43,065 --> 01:16:46,034
It's the dry drought weather
that's killing these trees.

869
01:16:46,068 --> 01:16:48,638
There's not enough
rain and water.

870
01:16:48,672 --> 01:16:51,840
Even worse, the spruce bark
beetles are eating

871
01:16:51,875 --> 01:16:54,811
These trees
to death and turning them
from green to red.

872
01:16:54,843 --> 01:16:58,013
I remember when those
beetles used to die out
during the winter.

873
01:16:58,046 --> 01:17:01,016
But now with the dry climate
they've multiplied

874
01:17:01,049 --> 01:17:02,886
And taken over the forest.

875
01:17:02,918 --> 01:17:04,620
Take a look at that
dead redwood up there.

876
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:07,190
That was killed
by a bark beetle.

877
01:17:13,129 --> 01:17:15,764
This damn global warming.

878
01:17:15,798 --> 01:17:18,702
It's the cause of dry climate
and bark beetles

879
01:17:18,734 --> 01:17:21,036
And death of the trees
and forest.

880
01:17:21,069 --> 01:17:23,105
I can protect these trees

881
01:17:23,139 --> 01:17:25,809
Against greedy
lumber companies

882
01:17:25,841 --> 01:17:28,812
And bad campers who start
forest wildfires.

883
01:17:28,844 --> 01:17:32,816
But it's impossible to protect
them against global warming.

884
01:17:32,848 --> 01:17:35,151
- What's your name?
- I'm tom hill.

885
01:17:35,184 --> 01:17:38,755
I'm rod. This is nathalie,
Susan and Tony.

886
01:17:41,758 --> 01:17:43,159
You can come with us.

887
01:17:43,192 --> 01:17:45,729
Oh, I can't.

888
01:17:45,762 --> 01:17:47,062
This is my home.

889
01:17:47,095 --> 01:17:50,132
I have to stay here
to protect these trees
from further harm.

890
01:17:50,166 --> 01:17:53,937
Enjoy and appreciate these
trees while you can.

891
01:17:56,840 --> 01:17:59,407
In a few years
they'll be gone.

892
01:17:59,442 --> 01:18:01,043
- (Growling)
- I hear a Mountain lion.

893
01:18:01,076 --> 01:18:02,746
I've got to get
back to my house.

894
01:18:02,779 --> 01:18:04,680
You'd better get to your car.
It was very nice meeting you.

895
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:07,449
You too.

896
01:18:40,216 --> 01:18:41,950
I think it's this way
to the van.

897
01:18:41,985 --> 01:18:43,787
- No, it's this way.
- Are you sure?

898
01:18:43,820 --> 01:18:45,187
What's that smell?

899
01:18:45,221 --> 01:18:47,423
Smells like wood burning.

900
01:18:53,128 --> 01:18:55,731
It's a forest fire.
Let's go, come on.
This way.

901
01:19:01,938 --> 01:19:04,507
(Coughing)

902
01:19:20,123 --> 01:19:22,358
(Coughing)

903
01:19:34,871 --> 01:19:36,404
(Engine starts)

904
01:20:08,304 --> 01:20:10,272
- You see that lighthouse
over there?
- Mm-hmm.

905
01:20:10,306 --> 01:20:13,176
That's where mai lives.
We should stop by and see
if she's there.

906
01:20:13,209 --> 01:20:14,943
Okay.

907
01:20:17,613 --> 01:20:19,148
- Oh my God.
- What?

908
01:20:19,182 --> 01:20:21,083
That's mai's car.

909
01:20:21,117 --> 01:20:23,887
- We should pull over.
- Okay.

910
01:20:48,176 --> 01:20:50,578
Oh God, mai.
Mai, are you okay?

911
01:20:50,613 --> 01:20:52,615
Mai.

912
01:20:52,647 --> 01:20:54,316
Nat?

913
01:20:54,350 --> 01:20:56,119
Mai.

914
01:20:56,151 --> 01:20:58,955
(Weakly)
Forgive them...

915
01:20:58,988 --> 01:21:01,024
Mai.
Mai?

916
01:21:01,057 --> 01:21:03,591
Mai!
God.

917
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:07,029
Mai.

918
01:21:31,653 --> 01:21:34,057
Damn it!
We ran out of gas.

919
01:21:34,089 --> 01:21:36,024
What are we gonna do?

920
01:21:36,059 --> 01:21:38,894
If we're lucky someone
might drive by.

921
01:21:54,978 --> 01:21:58,081
- I'm hungry.
- Me too, I'm hungry.

922
01:21:58,114 --> 01:22:00,148
We've got to find a way
to get them some food.

923
01:22:00,183 --> 01:22:02,952
- What should we do?
- I don't know.

924
01:22:20,035 --> 01:22:21,937
Hey look, a fishing rod.

925
01:22:23,006 --> 01:22:24,540
I can go catch some fish.

926
01:22:26,074 --> 01:22:29,277
Oh look, a stove.
We can cook it.

927
01:22:30,712 --> 01:22:32,380
Hey, good idea.

928
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:07,616
(Chatting quietly)

929
01:23:23,131 --> 01:23:25,234
Hey, nat.
I'll go fishing over there.

930
01:23:25,267 --> 01:23:27,303
How about you and the kids
go get some seaweed?

931
01:23:27,335 --> 01:23:29,072
Okay.

932
01:23:32,575 --> 01:23:34,310
You guys eat seaweed?

933
01:23:34,342 --> 01:23:36,478
Seaweed's the best.
It's good for your health.

934
01:23:36,512 --> 01:23:38,547
Nathalie:
Is that right?

935
01:24:25,393 --> 01:24:27,430
Rod:
I caught a fish!

936
01:24:27,462 --> 01:24:29,865
- He caught a fish.
- Yay!

937
01:24:29,897 --> 01:24:31,533
Awesome.

938
01:24:38,574 --> 01:24:41,809
I got a fish.

939
01:24:41,844 --> 01:24:43,612
Looks good.

940
01:24:43,646 --> 01:24:45,413
I got some seaweed.

941
01:24:48,584 --> 01:24:50,452
Good.

942
01:24:50,485 --> 01:24:52,288
I'm gonna go up to the van
and get the stove

943
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:54,089
So we can cook this.

944
01:25:28,724 --> 01:25:31,660
Here you go.
This'll be good for us.

945
01:25:34,930 --> 01:25:36,598
Yuck.
I want a happy meal.

946
01:25:36,632 --> 01:25:38,866
Me too.

947
01:25:38,901 --> 01:25:41,503
I know, you guys.
There's no happy meals
around here.

948
01:25:41,536 --> 01:25:44,173
Just try the seaweed.
It'll be really good.

949
01:25:44,207 --> 01:25:46,608
- No.
- No, I want a happy meal.

950
01:25:46,642 --> 01:25:48,576
I don't know.

951
01:25:53,716 --> 01:25:55,883
(Birds screeching)

952
01:25:57,952 --> 01:25:59,554
Guys.
Guys, get up.

953
01:25:59,587 --> 01:26:00,656
The eagles.
The eagles.

954
01:26:00,689 --> 01:26:02,590
Come on,
we've got to go.

955
01:26:08,497 --> 01:26:09,732
(Screeching)

956
01:26:26,982 --> 01:26:29,418
(Gunshots)

957
01:26:37,024 --> 01:26:39,762
(Thumping)

958
01:26:47,770 --> 01:26:50,373
Damn,
I'm out of bullets.

959
01:26:56,379 --> 01:26:58,714
Nat, you hit them if they get
through windshield, okay?

960
01:27:19,667 --> 01:27:20,969
(Thumps)

961
01:27:38,586 --> 01:27:40,555
