1
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:17,780
Come on, get that sun lamp ready.

2
00:01:17,885 --> 00:01:20,581
About 15 minutes is the most l'd advise,
Mr. Warriner.

3
00:01:20,688 --> 00:01:25,091
Fifteen minutes nothing! l need
a deep Florida tan if it takes all afternoon.

4
00:01:25,193 --> 00:01:26,626
Give her the gun.

5
00:01:26,728 --> 00:01:30,027
All aboard for Miami,
Palm Beach and Point South.

6
00:01:30,098 --> 00:01:32,293
-Hi, Jerry.
-Hello, Frank.

7
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,129
-How goes it?
-Fine!

8
00:01:34,235 --> 00:01:36,726
-Like to play a little squash?
-No, thanks.

9
00:01:36,804 --> 00:01:40,535
You're awfully white-skinned
for a guy who spent two weeks in Florida.

10
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:43,873
-That's what l thought.
-What did you do there, carry a parasol?

11
00:01:43,945 --> 00:01:47,745
-Or didn't you go?
-Don't go spreading that around, Frank.

12
00:01:48,549 --> 00:01:51,347
Pulling a fast one on the little wife?

13
00:01:51,419 --> 00:01:55,515
Frank, l'm surprised at you.
l'm supposed to have been in Florida.

14
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:58,024
Supposing one of Lucy's friends
says to her:

15
00:01:58,092 --> 00:02:00,959
''Well, why isn't he tanned?''
Lucy will be embarrassed.

16
00:02:01,062 --> 00:02:03,462
l'll be tanned,
and Lucy won't be embarrassed.

17
00:02:03,564 --> 00:02:07,694
What wives don't know won't hurt them.
What you don't know won't hurt you.

18
00:02:07,769 --> 00:02:10,670
l don't want to know.
How about coming by the house?

19
00:02:10,738 --> 00:02:13,104
Some friends are coming by
for a late breakfast.

20
00:02:13,207 --> 00:02:17,041
l got a better idea. Come to my place
for eggnogs and breakfast...

21
00:02:17,111 --> 00:02:20,205
and maybe later we can duck the women
and play some golf.

22
00:02:20,281 --> 00:02:22,613
-Swell, boy, you got me convinced.
-Okay.

23
00:02:22,717 --> 00:02:24,514
-See you later, Jerry.
-So long, Frank.

24
00:02:25,953 --> 00:02:27,420
Come on in!

25
00:02:27,755 --> 00:02:29,120
Hey, Lucy!

26
00:02:31,225 --> 00:02:32,852
That man is here.

27
00:02:32,927 --> 00:02:34,895
Maybe she wasn't expecting you.

28
00:02:34,962 --> 00:02:38,329
No, she's around somewhere.
Put your things down anywhere.

29
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:41,329
-Hello, Celeste.
-Hello, Mr. Warriner, you look well.

30
00:02:41,402 --> 00:02:43,927
Thank you, Celeste, and vice versa.

31
00:02:44,238 --> 00:02:47,674
Where's Mrs. Warriner? Look what l got her
all the way from Florida.

32
00:02:47,742 --> 00:02:49,710
-She's out.
-She's out?

33
00:02:51,412 --> 00:02:54,848
Never mind. Go get some eggnogs,
and we'll find something to drink to.

34
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:56,781
Come on, gang, enter.

35
00:03:00,354 --> 00:03:03,050
Mr. Smith, look who's here.

36
00:03:05,593 --> 00:03:07,083
Come on, boy.

37
00:03:08,362 --> 00:03:09,761
Where's Mamma?

38
00:03:09,864 --> 00:03:12,389
Look, l've got something for you.

39
00:03:13,534 --> 00:03:15,229
Come on, get it.

40
00:03:20,341 --> 00:03:22,605
What are you doing, reading my mail?

41
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:26,339
Several letters there for your wife.
Yesterday's, too.

42
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:32,383
l hope Lucy comes back
looking as well as you do.

43
00:03:32,487 --> 00:03:37,481
She's probably up at her Aunt Patsy's.
She always goes there when she's lonely.

44
00:03:38,993 --> 00:03:41,359
Thank you, Celeste, l'll take it up from here.

45
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:42,896
-Jerry.
-What?

46
00:03:42,997 --> 00:03:45,522
Supposing Aunt Patsy wasn't home?

47
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,728
l get it. l'm up to my neck in funny people!

48
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:53,705
Seriously, l wish Lucy would go out and
get some fun now and again. Do her good.

49
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:58,710
That's the trouble with marriages today.
People are always imagining things.

50
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,974
The road to Reno is paved with suspicions.

51
00:04:02,049 --> 00:04:04,574
First thing you know,
they're in a divorce court.

52
00:04:04,685 --> 00:04:07,654
The broad-minded man from the Rio Grande!

53
00:04:07,722 --> 00:04:11,920
lf you think l'll get a chance to prove my
broad-mindedness any minute, you're crazy.

54
00:04:12,026 --> 00:04:15,086
Lucy's up at her Aunt Patsy's cabin.
l'll bet on it.

55
00:04:15,196 --> 00:04:18,757
lncidentally, what a swell spot that is.
Good fishing....

56
00:04:18,866 --> 00:04:22,825
Sometimes, on a clear day across that lake,
you can see for....

57
00:04:30,211 --> 00:04:34,409
Mrs. Barnsley, Miss Heath,
Mr. Barnsley, Mr. Randall.

58
00:04:38,586 --> 00:04:40,019
Aunt Patsy.

59
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:46,157
Any idea where Lucy is?
You know, she invited me to this--

60
00:04:49,897 --> 00:04:52,866
-Darling!
-Hello, dear!

61
00:04:52,967 --> 00:04:56,061
How grand and brown you are!
Hello, Patsy, dear.

62
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:59,662
-Did you miss me? Been thinking about me?
-Look what l brought you!

63
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:02,800
All the way from Florida? Bless your heart!

64
00:05:06,214 --> 00:05:08,580
You know Armand Duvalle, dear.

65
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,581
Come on in, Armand.

66
00:05:12,987 --> 00:05:15,285
Mr. Duvalle, this is my aunt, Miss Adams.

67
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:18,052
Mr. and Mrs. Barnsley,
Miss Heath and Mr. Randall.

68
00:05:18,159 --> 00:05:20,127
We've had the most terrible time.

69
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:22,958
Armand's car broke down last night
miles from nowhere...

70
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:27,330
and we had to stay at the nastiest inn ever.
No modern conveniences. lt was dreadful!

71
00:05:27,401 --> 00:05:31,360
We were coming home from the junior prom.
Armand's pupil invited us.

72
00:05:31,472 --> 00:05:35,408
Oh, it's a long story, but l must....
Hello, there!

73
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:39,168
Your wife, she was the loveliest woman
in the party.

74
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,840
Armand, you always say the nicest things.

75
00:05:41,949 --> 00:05:43,814
lsn't that cute? Did you bring him that?

76
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:45,785
-Yes--
-Go catch it!

77
00:05:47,021 --> 00:05:52,220
-Were you disappointed l wasn't here?
-Not at all. After all, you didn't expect me.

78
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:56,191
And you'll forgive me
for my car's imperfect performance?

79
00:05:56,497 --> 00:06:00,365
Of course.
l'm sorry the inn was so inconvenient.

80
00:06:00,968 --> 00:06:03,698
That's the only thing that bothers me.

81
00:06:04,071 --> 00:06:07,666
You know, your husband
is not like the average American man.

82
00:06:07,775 --> 00:06:10,676
He's free of all mean suspicion.

83
00:06:10,845 --> 00:06:14,212
He has more the Continental mind. Yes?

84
00:06:14,315 --> 00:06:18,012
That's right, l have a Continental mind.
Will you have an eggnog?

85
00:06:18,119 --> 00:06:19,484
Thank you.

86
00:06:25,026 --> 00:06:28,962
l don't know what kind of a mind Jerry's got,
Continental or cockeyed...

87
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:32,329
but he's a wonder.
Now, if l stayed out all night...

88
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:36,301
and waltzed in with handsome Mr. Duvalle,
and said the car broke down....

89
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:39,601
lt did. Why should Jerry be angry?
l didn't build the car.

90
00:06:39,674 --> 00:06:42,837
-You're perfectly right, dear.
-Of course l am.

91
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:46,141
Can't have a happy married life
if you're always suspicious.

92
00:06:46,213 --> 00:06:47,680
Right again.

93
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:50,008
-A little nutmeg?
-Please.

94
00:06:50,651 --> 00:06:54,678
-Why am l boring you with private matters?
-We're not bored.

95
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:58,418
No one's interested in my adventure
but Jerry, who knows it's innocent...

96
00:06:58,492 --> 00:07:02,622
just as well as he knows
that he just got back from Florida.

97
00:07:04,365 --> 00:07:06,265
l see what you mean.

98
00:07:07,935 --> 00:07:10,768
More drinks, everybody? There's lots left.

99
00:07:10,838 --> 00:07:15,207
-No, thank you, l think we better be going.
-You don't all have to go, do you?

100
00:07:15,509 --> 00:07:17,306
Go? No.

101
00:07:19,113 --> 00:07:22,480
-Well, it's silly to go so soon.
-We must go, really.

102
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:26,350
Patsy, dear, where are you going?
l haven't even had a chance to talk to you.

103
00:07:26,454 --> 00:07:28,684
l'll see you later, my dear.

104
00:07:28,789 --> 00:07:31,587
l always say four's a crowd.

105
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,754
There's something in what she says.

106
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:42,867
Thank you.

107
00:07:44,538 --> 00:07:47,996
-Say, are you hungry?
-To tell you the truth, l'm starved.

108
00:07:48,109 --> 00:07:50,475
Why don't you go out and grab a bite?

109
00:07:50,578 --> 00:07:55,515
-A strong fellow should take care of himself.
-Why, what have l done?

110
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:58,685
-lf you speak of last night, l assure you--
-You don't believe--

111
00:07:58,786 --> 00:08:00,686
We'll discuss it in private.

112
00:08:00,788 --> 00:08:04,747
That is if Mr. Duvalle can remember
where we keep our door.

113
00:08:04,825 --> 00:08:08,784
ln all fairness, you should permit me
to remain and explain ourselves.

114
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:11,354
American women
aren't accustomed to gallantry.

115
00:08:11,465 --> 00:08:14,195
l appreciate your offer,
but maybe you'd better go.

116
00:08:14,301 --> 00:08:16,735
Pardon me, Mrs. Warriner,
you misunderstand.

117
00:08:16,804 --> 00:08:19,238
l am a voice teacher, am l not?

118
00:08:19,306 --> 00:08:24,505
For one year she has been my pupil.
And from time to time, l pat her on the back.

119
00:08:24,612 --> 00:08:27,809
l mean, l congratulate her on her...

120
00:08:28,449 --> 00:08:30,246
-development.
-ls that so?

121
00:08:30,317 --> 00:08:33,013
-Do l express myself?
-You've been doing all right.

122
00:08:33,254 --> 00:08:37,748
But now my position must be considered.
l have never yet been in a scandal.

123
00:08:37,825 --> 00:08:39,850
-Never been caught?
-No.

124
00:08:40,628 --> 00:08:43,563
l am a great teacher, not a great lover.

125
00:08:43,664 --> 00:08:47,794
That's right, Armand, no one could ever
accuse you of being a great lover.

126
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:51,736
That is, l mean to say,
who's to say whether you are or not?

127
00:08:51,806 --> 00:08:54,969
lt's all so silly!
But maybe you had better go.

128
00:08:56,077 --> 00:09:00,514
-l really don't know what to say.
-lf you go, you won't have to say anything.

129
00:09:00,614 --> 00:09:04,311
-Perhaps it is best this way, Mrs. Warriner.
-l think so.

130
00:09:05,619 --> 00:09:07,780
-l will see you soon?
-Yes.

131
00:09:07,888 --> 00:09:10,049
lt has been all so perfect.

132
00:09:10,724 --> 00:09:12,783
Thank you for everything.

133
00:09:12,893 --> 00:09:14,383
Take another bow.

134
00:09:14,462 --> 00:09:17,397
Not a bad performance
considering no rehearsals or anything.

135
00:09:17,465 --> 00:09:20,923
Why, Mr. Warriner,
you're out of your Continental mind.

136
00:09:25,906 --> 00:09:29,672
That was funny, what he said
about your Continental mind.

137
00:09:30,244 --> 00:09:34,578
-No doubt he has a better sense of humor.
-No, l beg to differ.

138
00:09:34,648 --> 00:09:36,946
Right now you're twice as funny as him.

139
00:09:37,084 --> 00:09:38,881
-Quit stalling, Lucy.
-l'm not--

140
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:40,944
Perhaps our marriage means nothing to you.

141
00:09:41,055 --> 00:09:44,718
Perhaps you have no sentiment left for me.
Look at this.

142
00:09:47,094 --> 00:09:51,121
Look, a letter l wrote you.
Did you care when you read it? No!

143
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:54,493
You knew there'd be a letter
every morning...

144
00:09:54,602 --> 00:09:57,969
but you were far too busy
with Armand Duvalle to give it a thought.

145
00:09:58,072 --> 00:10:00,404
lt's enough to destroy one's faith, isn't it?

146
00:10:01,442 --> 00:10:04,036
l haven't any faith left in anyone.

147
00:10:04,278 --> 00:10:06,405
l know just how you feel.

148
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:08,877
What do you mean?

149
00:10:17,057 --> 00:10:21,391
You didn't mention in any of your letters
the terrible rainy spell in Florida.

150
00:10:21,462 --> 00:10:23,657
The papers were full of it.

151
00:10:25,266 --> 00:10:28,394
-l can explain that, Lucy.
-You can?

152
00:10:28,469 --> 00:10:32,906
Don't try to change the subject.
You think a great offense is a great defense.

153
00:10:32,973 --> 00:10:36,238
Don't try to justify your behavior
by insinuating things about me.

154
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:39,302
l haven't any behavior to justify.
l've just been unlucky.

155
00:10:39,547 --> 00:10:43,950
You caught me in a truth, and it seems
there's nothing less logical than the truth.

156
00:10:44,051 --> 00:10:46,383
-A philosopher?
-You don't believe me.

157
00:10:46,453 --> 00:10:48,717
How can l believe you?
''The car broke down.''

158
00:10:48,789 --> 00:10:51,087
People stopped believing that ages ago.

159
00:10:51,225 --> 00:10:53,625
-His car's very old.
-So is his story.

160
00:10:53,727 --> 00:10:56,423
-Let me tell you something.
-Let me tell you something.

161
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:59,090
l told you the truth about all this, Jerry.

162
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,226
Don't you see?
There can't be any doubt in marriage.

163
00:11:02,303 --> 00:11:06,603
The whole thing's built on faith.
lf you've lost that, you've lost everything.

164
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:09,141
When that's gone
the marriage is washed up.

165
00:11:09,243 --> 00:11:10,938
-Do you mean that?
-Yes.

166
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:13,240
-Then that settles it.
-l guess it does.

167
00:11:13,314 --> 00:11:16,613
l wouldn't go on living with you
if you were dipped in platinum.

168
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:18,708
So divorce me. lt'll be a pleasure.

169
00:11:18,786 --> 00:11:23,587
You think l'd drag that music lover to court
to show people the man you preferred?

170
00:11:23,691 --> 00:11:27,092
Then l'll divorce you.
lt's customary for the wife to bring suit.

171
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:30,254
lt has something to do
with the husband being a gentleman.

172
00:11:30,397 --> 00:11:33,264
Just get on with the divorce proceedings.
l can't wait.

173
00:11:33,367 --> 00:11:36,131
-l'll call our lawyer right now.
-All right, here.

174
00:11:36,537 --> 00:11:40,701
You don't mind? l don't know anyone else.
You get around much more than l do.

175
00:11:40,774 --> 00:11:42,241
ls that so?

176
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:51,078
Hello?

177
00:11:51,619 --> 00:11:53,109
Hello, Lucy.

178
00:11:53,854 --> 00:11:55,287
What's that?

179
00:11:55,389 --> 00:11:57,755
Divorce? You and Jerry?

180
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:02,756
Don't do anything in haste
you might regret later.

181
00:12:02,863 --> 00:12:06,924
-Marriage is a beautiful thing, and you--
-Can't she call back after we've eaten?

182
00:12:07,034 --> 00:12:09,127
Please be quiet, will you?

183
00:12:10,237 --> 00:12:13,365
You seem agitated, Lucy.
Try and calm yourself.

184
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,171
l'd hate to see you take any hasty action
in a matter like this.

185
00:12:17,244 --> 00:12:20,111
-Marriage is a beautiful thing, and you--
-Finish your meal.

186
00:12:20,214 --> 00:12:24,014
-Why can't they call you back later?
-Will you shut your mouth?

187
00:12:24,418 --> 00:12:27,546
As l was saying, Lucy,
marriage is a beautiful thing.

188
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:31,057
When you've been married as long as l,
you'll appreciate it, too.

189
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:34,583
Your food's getting ice-cold.
You always complain about your food.

190
00:12:34,695 --> 00:12:37,926
Just shut your big mouth.
l'll eat when l'm good and ready.

191
00:12:38,032 --> 00:12:41,900
lf you don't like it,
you know what you can do. So shut up!

192
00:12:43,704 --> 00:12:45,763
Marriage is a beautiful thing.

193
00:12:52,713 --> 00:12:57,116
You see? Because you were a naughty dog,
they made you leave the room. Come on.

194
00:12:57,718 --> 00:13:00,778
ln the case of Warriner v. Warriner,
the court grants...

195
00:13:00,888 --> 00:13:04,483
an interlocutory decree of divorce
in favor of the plaintiff, Lucy Warriner.

196
00:13:04,558 --> 00:13:08,517
The divorce, without further contesting,
will become final 90 days from this day.

197
00:13:08,595 --> 00:13:13,157
Plaintiff and defendant then have the liberty
to make other marriages, if they so desire.

198
00:13:13,233 --> 00:13:16,396
Your Honor, there's a matter still unsettled.

199
00:13:16,937 --> 00:13:20,498
-The matter about....
-Mr. Smith.

200
00:13:20,574 --> 00:13:23,509
-Yes, Your Honor, Mr. Smith.
-Who is Mr. Smith?

201
00:13:23,577 --> 00:13:27,013
-Mr. Smith is their dog.
-No, Mr. Smith is my dog.

202
00:13:27,081 --> 00:13:29,413
-ls that so?
-Silence!

203
00:13:29,516 --> 00:13:32,349
But, you see, Mr. Smith belongs to me,
and she has him.

204
00:13:32,419 --> 00:13:34,216
Very well, go ahead.

205
00:13:34,321 --> 00:13:36,585
The animal is in Mrs. Warriner's possession.

206
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:40,387
You ordered him from the courtroom
at the beginning, for contempt.

207
00:13:40,494 --> 00:13:44,555
-Mr. Warriner wishes to have him because....
-Because he's mine!

208
00:13:44,665 --> 00:13:46,656
-He is not.
-He is, too.

209
00:13:46,767 --> 00:13:48,701
-He is not.
-Silence!

210
00:13:50,237 --> 00:13:51,499
ls not.

211
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:56,370
Mrs. Warriner, step up and tell me
why you regard the dog...

212
00:13:56,477 --> 00:14:00,470
as your personal property, so the court
may decide if he should remain with you.

213
00:14:00,547 --> 00:14:02,845
Nothing would please me more.

214
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:06,015
Your Honor, l saw Mr. Smith first.

215
00:14:06,086 --> 00:14:09,214
lt was in that pet shop on Madison Avenue.
You know it?

216
00:14:09,323 --> 00:14:13,760
-You don't? lt's between 47th and....
-lt's frightfully immaterial.

217
00:14:14,862 --> 00:14:18,354
Well, you ought to know.
l decided to buy Mr. Smith...

218
00:14:18,432 --> 00:14:23,131
but l turned away for a moment
to look at a Persian kitten. Do you like cats?

219
00:14:23,203 --> 00:14:28,004
l don't either. So l turned around again,
and this man had Mr. Smith in his arms.

220
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:32,808
l said, ''Pardon me, l'm buying this puppy.''
And then he just smiled at me.

221
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,043
Then somehow, suddenly,
the three of us were having lunch...

222
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:39,984
the man, and Mr. Smith, and l.
And then things happened swiftly...

223
00:14:40,053 --> 00:14:42,521
so l said, ''We'd better get married,''
and we did.

224
00:14:42,589 --> 00:14:46,355
That way we could give Mr. Smith
a better home and live happily ever after.

225
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:48,519
-Until now.
-l see.

226
00:14:49,229 --> 00:14:51,390
ln these custody cases, Mrs. Warriner...

227
00:14:51,498 --> 00:14:55,195
we often allow the final decision
to rest with the party in question.

228
00:14:55,302 --> 00:14:57,065
You mean Mr. Smith?

229
00:14:57,671 --> 00:14:59,366
Send for the dog.

230
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:04,507
Custody of the dog
will depend on his own desire.

231
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:10,072
-Mr. Warriner, will you step up here, please?
-Yes, Your Honor.

232
00:15:17,224 --> 00:15:18,714
Unfasten him.

233
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:25,223
You may each call the dog.

234
00:15:25,499 --> 00:15:28,662
-Mr. Smith, come on, boy.
-Smitty, look up here.

235
00:15:35,409 --> 00:15:37,969
Don't pay attention. Come on, boy.

236
00:15:38,045 --> 00:15:41,014
Look up here. You know me.

237
00:15:45,285 --> 00:15:48,186
-Smitty, look up here.
-No, don't!

238
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:53,554
l win.

239
00:15:53,794 --> 00:15:56,695
Custody of the dog
is awarded to Mrs. Warriner.

240
00:15:56,797 --> 00:16:00,631
Your Honor, that's not quite fair.
l ought to see the dog twice a month or so.

241
00:16:00,701 --> 00:16:02,498
-l'll take it under advisement.
-Goodbye.

242
00:16:02,569 --> 00:16:04,696
Thank you. Goodbye.

243
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:07,870
Goodbye, Your Honor.

244
00:16:08,475 --> 00:16:12,377
-You won't forget to do that, Judge?
-l'll take it under advisement.

245
00:16:12,479 --> 00:16:14,538
Yes, but when will you know?

246
00:16:21,822 --> 00:16:24,222
Look at that rain!

247
00:16:24,324 --> 00:16:28,317
-Why, is it doing anything besides falling?
-l don't think so.

248
00:16:28,495 --> 00:16:31,362
Nothing unusual ever happens around here.

249
00:16:31,798 --> 00:16:34,767
Patsy, l'm sorry you're so bored tonight.

250
00:16:34,835 --> 00:16:37,804
Why tonight? l've been bored for a month.

251
00:16:38,005 --> 00:16:42,533
lf l'd known we'd be buried side by side
l'd never have taken this apartment.

252
00:16:42,643 --> 00:16:46,943
l wouldn't have asked you to come
and live with me if l'd known that...

253
00:16:47,014 --> 00:16:50,882
a sort of readjustment
takes place after divorce.

254
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:55,719
Readjustment my foot!
That's just another word for moping around.

255
00:16:55,856 --> 00:16:59,348
Don't be silly.
Anyhow, where can two women go alone?

256
00:16:59,459 --> 00:17:03,520
You know dozens of men
who'd turn handsprings to take you out.

257
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:07,794
l've got you all dressed up, ready to go out,
and you weaken and refuse.

258
00:17:07,868 --> 00:17:09,699
You're just an old grouch.

259
00:17:09,803 --> 00:17:12,863
l want to go where there's life.
And l don't mean plant life.

260
00:17:12,973 --> 00:17:14,770
l want to go to the theater.

261
00:17:14,841 --> 00:17:17,935
You know, go places later
and step around and do things.

262
00:17:18,011 --> 00:17:21,037
-But you can't go in all this rain.
-Why not, no taxis?

263
00:17:21,348 --> 00:17:22,747
No escort.

264
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:26,681
Unless there's a new ruling,
l don't need an escort to get a drink.

265
00:17:26,787 --> 00:17:29,255
l'm going down to the bar and see Joe.

266
00:17:29,323 --> 00:17:32,315
Bartender or no bartender, he's still a man.

267
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:35,293
-Maybe he knocks off early.
-Patsy, you wouldn't!

268
00:17:35,362 --> 00:17:38,331
l wouldn't?
You're talking to a desperate woman.

269
00:17:38,632 --> 00:17:41,032
Hello, Smitty, come on up, boy.

270
00:17:41,768 --> 00:17:45,260
-lsn't he cute?
-Too bad he can't wear a top hat.

271
00:17:48,008 --> 00:17:50,169
Did you hear what she said?

272
00:18:25,345 --> 00:18:29,679
-l wonder if you'd do me a favor?
-Well, of course, that all depends.

273
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:51,604
lmagine you living right across the hall
from us all of this time.

274
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:55,130
l think it's just wonderful
that we've met this way.

275
00:19:03,417 --> 00:19:05,783
Lucy, may l present Mr. Leeson?

276
00:19:05,852 --> 00:19:09,618
This is my niece you wanted to meet.
Her name is Lucy Warriner.

277
00:19:09,723 --> 00:19:11,782
How do you do?

278
00:19:11,892 --> 00:19:14,122
-Won't you sit down?
-Thanks.

279
00:19:15,228 --> 00:19:19,062
Mr. Leeson's just from Oklahoma, Lucy.
He's a stranger in town.

280
00:19:19,132 --> 00:19:23,660
He'd take it as real neighborly of us
if we show him some of the bright spots.

281
00:19:24,137 --> 00:19:25,661
He would?

282
00:19:26,273 --> 00:19:28,605
lt's raining awfully hard. l don't think--

283
00:19:28,675 --> 00:19:33,203
That's just exactly what l said,
''l don't think the rain will stop us.''

284
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,477
Besides, l think it'll let up in a few minutes,
Miss Warriner.

285
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:40,314
Mr. Leeson's a neighbor.
He lives across the hall with his mother.

286
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:43,048
-That's what you said, right?
-Yes, with my mother.

287
00:19:43,123 --> 00:19:45,489
We're here on a visit. l'm in oil, you know.

288
00:19:45,592 --> 00:19:47,389
Marinated, so to speak.

289
00:19:48,929 --> 00:19:54,094
Say, that's a good one!
l got to remember to tell that to my mother.

290
00:19:54,334 --> 00:19:57,826
Mr. Leeson, won't you tell us
something about Oklahoma?

291
00:19:58,839 --> 00:20:00,932
Oklahoma's pretty swell.

292
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:06,209
l got quite a ranch down there.
Like you to see it sometime, Miss Warriner.

293
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:09,043
l don't get out there very....

294
00:20:09,716 --> 00:20:14,085
l got cattle and horses
and chickens and alfalfa and--

295
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:23,089
-Hello, Jerry.
-Patsy, how are things?

296
00:20:23,163 --> 00:20:26,360
-We weren't expecting you.
-Why, what goes on?

297
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:33,573
Hiya, fellow! Mr. Smith, how have you been?

298
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:36,108
l'll see you in a minute, boy. Yeah, sure.

299
00:20:36,209 --> 00:20:38,609
-Hello, Jerry.
-Hello, Lucy.

300
00:20:38,712 --> 00:20:40,612
What might you be doing here?

301
00:20:40,714 --> 00:20:43,547
Have you forgotten
this is my day to visit Mr. Smith?

302
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:45,642
lt says so right there.

303
00:20:50,157 --> 00:20:53,251
l'm so sorry.
Mr. Leeson, this is my husband.

304
00:20:55,962 --> 00:20:59,261
He's only my husband for,
how much longer is it now, 60 days?

305
00:20:59,366 --> 00:21:02,529
-Fifty-nine.
-That's better, only 59 days.

306
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:06,128
And don't worry about him,
he has a Continental mind.

307
00:21:09,075 --> 00:21:12,272
-Excuse me, what did you say?
-l'm glad to know you.

308
00:21:12,379 --> 00:21:14,210
How can you be glad to know me?

309
00:21:14,281 --> 00:21:17,739
l know how l'd feel if l was with a girl
and her husband walked in.

310
00:21:17,851 --> 00:21:19,512
l'll bet you do.

311
00:21:19,719 --> 00:21:23,712
l don't think you ought to go around
telling people you're not married.

312
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:26,258
He looks a nice fellow.
How do you think he feels?

313
00:21:26,359 --> 00:21:31,262
-Why don't you go play with the dog?
-You go on with whatever you were doing.

314
00:21:31,364 --> 00:21:32,888
Don't mind me.

315
00:21:38,371 --> 00:21:41,568
Any new dogs in the neighborhood?
Been chasing any cats?

316
00:21:41,641 --> 00:21:43,575
Sit down, Mr. Leeson.

317
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:46,703
-Tell me some more about Arizona.
-Oklahoma.

318
00:21:46,913 --> 00:21:50,007
l mean Oklahoma. That's me for you!

319
00:21:52,619 --> 00:21:55,349
ls he getting enough to eat lately?
He doesn't look well.

320
00:21:55,422 --> 00:21:57,788
You don't look so hot yourself.

321
00:22:01,394 --> 00:22:05,592
l don't think he's getting enough exercise.
He's got circles under his eyes.

322
00:22:13,073 --> 00:22:15,405
-The court ruled--
-What about a tune, boy?

323
00:22:15,508 --> 00:22:18,409
Yes. You see,
there's nothing we can do about it.

324
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:22,180
Don't worry about it, Mr. Leeson.
Go right ahead.

325
00:22:29,589 --> 00:22:31,853
-My main business is oil.
-Oil?

326
00:22:36,663 --> 00:22:37,925
Sing it!

327
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:43,760
l do pretty well.

328
00:22:44,838 --> 00:22:47,568
l have a ranch. My hobby is horses.

329
00:22:48,508 --> 00:22:49,770
Hobby horses!

330
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,520
Come on, let's get out of here.

331
00:23:09,162 --> 00:23:12,325
-Goodbye, Jerry.
-Goodbye, Warriner.

332
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:27,208
What's the matter?

333
00:23:27,414 --> 00:23:30,906
-Are you sure you don't like that fellow?
-Like him!

334
00:23:31,017 --> 00:23:34,680
-You saw how l treated him, didn't you?
-That's what l mean.

335
00:23:34,754 --> 00:23:38,918
On my ranch l got a little red rooster
and a little brown hen...

336
00:23:39,025 --> 00:23:41,391
and they fight all the time, too.

337
00:23:41,494 --> 00:23:45,863
But once in a while, they make up again,
and they're right friendly.

338
00:23:52,339 --> 00:23:56,139
-'Morning, Ma.
-Well? lt was daylight when you came in.

339
00:23:56,209 --> 00:23:58,200
l had a wonderful time. l met a girl--

340
00:23:58,311 --> 00:24:01,212
That's what l thought.
You keep your mind off women.

341
00:24:01,314 --> 00:24:02,508
l can't, Ma.

342
00:24:02,582 --> 00:24:05,346
You can't?
That's what your father always said.

343
00:24:06,052 --> 00:24:09,419
Of course l like Dan Leeson. Why not?
He's sweet and thoughtful.

344
00:24:09,522 --> 00:24:12,889
You should be the last one to object,
you introduced him to me.

345
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:17,054
He was a man who could take us out.
l didn't expect you to get silly about him.

346
00:24:17,163 --> 00:24:20,496
There's nothing wrong in liking a man
who's sane and considerate.

347
00:24:20,567 --> 00:24:23,331
l was married to one
who was insane and inconsiderate.

348
00:24:23,403 --> 00:24:25,337
Your toast is burning.

349
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:27,973
-What's her name?
-Lucy Warriner.

350
00:24:28,041 --> 00:24:29,633
Probably an alias.

351
00:24:29,709 --> 00:24:32,507
You'll laugh for talking that way
when you meet Lucy.

352
00:24:32,579 --> 00:24:36,413
She won't want to meet me. She knows
any woman could see through her.

353
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:39,246
Don't talk that way about Lucy.
l'm crazy about her.

354
00:24:39,652 --> 00:24:42,815
l believe she kind of likes me, too.
l think l'm in love.

355
00:24:42,889 --> 00:24:44,481
Do you know what rebound is?

356
00:24:44,557 --> 00:24:49,017
Trying to get over one love
by bouncing into love with somebody else.

357
00:24:49,195 --> 00:24:53,188
lt's fine, except the rebound is rarely
the real thing. ln fact, it's the bunk.

358
00:24:53,299 --> 00:24:56,564
There's the first bounce, the second, and....
Well, look at me.

359
00:24:56,669 --> 00:24:59,035
You wind up like an old tennis ball.

360
00:24:59,139 --> 00:25:02,575
l'm serious about Dan Leeson.
l like him very much.

361
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:04,904
l'm all through with Jerry,
he means nothing.

362
00:25:05,011 --> 00:25:07,707
l don't love him, and l probably never did.

363
00:25:07,814 --> 00:25:12,308
l'm sure l never loved him. Now l hate him.
That surprises you, doesn't it?

364
00:25:12,385 --> 00:25:14,979
l hate Jerry Warriner
and l like Dan Leeson very much.

365
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:18,388
l hope he's crazy about me,
because he's the finest man l've met.

366
00:25:18,491 --> 00:25:20,721
l know, my toast is burning.

367
00:25:30,303 --> 00:25:35,036
You're awful sweet and all that,
but your mind's always on something else.

368
00:25:35,375 --> 00:25:38,173
Or maybe someone else. ls it, sugar pie?

369
00:25:38,278 --> 00:25:40,439
No, l'm in love with love.

370
00:25:41,614 --> 00:25:45,311
''ln the spring,
a young man's fancy lightly turns to''...

371
00:25:46,152 --> 00:25:49,053
what he's been thinking about all winter.

372
00:25:49,389 --> 00:25:51,755
How long have you talked
like Amos and Andy?

373
00:25:51,825 --> 00:25:53,452
For quite some time.

374
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:56,461
l got wise to the fact
that it helps me in my work.

375
00:25:56,563 --> 00:26:01,262
So, as long as l work,
you'll have to pardon my Southern accent.

376
00:26:03,203 --> 00:26:07,003
Well, shut my mouth,
who's that gorgeous-looking creature?

377
00:26:13,146 --> 00:26:16,172
Have you heard that gag
that's been flying around town?

378
00:26:16,282 --> 00:26:18,273
''Who was that lady l saw you with?''

379
00:26:18,618 --> 00:26:21,610
You mean, that's no lady, that's your wife?

380
00:26:35,068 --> 00:26:37,662
l like this place best
of all the spots l've been to.

381
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:41,137
-You do?
-Maybe it's because l'm so happy.

382
00:26:41,241 --> 00:26:44,904
-Just think of it, Lucy. You'll be my wife.
-Yes, l am thinking of it.

383
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:48,641
l've hoped for it
ever since that first night l met you.

384
00:26:48,781 --> 00:26:51,750
l can hardly wait for your final decree
to come along.

385
00:26:51,818 --> 00:26:53,786
lt'll come along, Dan.

386
00:26:54,087 --> 00:26:57,488
lncidentally,
here's my husband coming along.

387
00:27:01,494 --> 00:27:03,359
-Hello, folks.
-Hello.

388
00:27:03,463 --> 00:27:04,953
This is Dixie Belle Lee.

389
00:27:05,031 --> 00:27:09,661
This is Mrs. Warriner, and Mr. Leeson,
the gentleman Mrs. Warriner will marry.

390
00:27:09,769 --> 00:27:12,932
-lt's mighty fine meeting you.
-Now come along.

391
00:27:14,774 --> 00:27:17,504
Now, you're sure we're not intruding?

392
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:20,669
-What do you mean?
-Wouldn't you like us to have a drink?

393
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:23,874
-Yes, of course.
-Sit down.

394
00:27:29,155 --> 00:27:31,055
My, isn't this cozy?

395
00:27:42,001 --> 00:27:45,232
So, you two are going to be married.

396
00:27:45,305 --> 00:27:50,402
l was glad to hear that. l said to myself,
''That Leeson's just the man for Lucy.''

397
00:27:51,411 --> 00:27:54,710
-Then l said to myself--
-He's always talking to himself.

398
00:27:54,781 --> 00:27:57,579
-lsn't this a charming place?
-Do you really like it?

399
00:27:57,650 --> 00:28:00,448
l'm so glad.
l almost feel like the place is mine.

400
00:28:00,553 --> 00:28:04,319
-You come here often?
-l work here, didn't you know that?

401
00:28:04,424 --> 00:28:05,482
No.

402
00:28:05,592 --> 00:28:07,787
You're from the South, aren't you?

403
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:11,887
Well, now isn't he just the cleverest gent?
How'd y'all ever guess that?

404
00:28:11,965 --> 00:28:15,093
l don't know, it was just a shot in the dark.

405
00:28:15,702 --> 00:28:18,102
But Dixie Belle Lee isn't her real name.

406
00:28:18,204 --> 00:28:20,695
-No?
-No, she changed it, you see...

407
00:28:20,873 --> 00:28:24,604
because her family objected
to her going into show business.

408
00:28:24,711 --> 00:28:29,114
My folks thought l was going to the dogs
when l decided to go to work.

409
00:28:29,215 --> 00:28:32,412
l'm sure you'll be a big success,
and then they'll be proud of you.

410
00:28:32,485 --> 00:28:36,421
Thank you. lt's real nice of you to say that.
l'd better go now and get ready.

411
00:28:36,556 --> 00:28:39,116
-Can you stay and see my act?
-We'll stay.

412
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:42,592
-Nothing could drag us away.
-See you later, then.

413
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:48,564
-She seems like a nice girl.
-lndeed.

414
00:28:48,635 --> 00:28:53,095
Enough about Dixie Belle for the moment.
Let's talk about yourselves.

415
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:56,939
So you're going to live in Oklahoma, Lucy?
How l envy you.

416
00:28:57,043 --> 00:29:01,639
Ever since l was a small boy
that name has been filled with magic for me.

417
00:29:01,881 --> 00:29:03,246
Oklahoma.

418
00:29:05,218 --> 00:29:07,948
We're going to live right in Oklahoma City.

419
00:29:08,054 --> 00:29:10,113
Not Oklahoma City itself?

420
00:29:12,191 --> 00:29:14,056
Lucy, you lucky girl.

421
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:17,058
No more running around the nightspots.

422
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:20,065
No more prowling around
in New York shops.

423
00:29:20,366 --> 00:29:23,699
l'll think of you whenever a show opens
and say to myself:

424
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:25,431
''She's well out of it.''

425
00:29:25,538 --> 00:29:29,235
New York's all right for a visit,
but l wouldn't want to live here.

426
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:31,777
l know l'll enjoy Oklahoma City.

427
00:29:32,612 --> 00:29:37,174
Of course. lf it gets dull,
you can always go to Tulsa for the weekend.

428
00:29:38,584 --> 00:29:42,111
l think a big change
like that does one good.

429
00:29:42,221 --> 00:29:43,711
That's right.

430
00:29:44,891 --> 00:29:49,385
l know this isn't quite the place,
but Lucy tells me you two own a coal mine.

431
00:29:49,529 --> 00:29:50,553
What about it?

432
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:55,363
Yes. Mr. Leeson thought that maybe
he'd like to buy your interest.

433
00:29:55,568 --> 00:29:57,627
That is, if the price is right.

434
00:29:57,737 --> 00:30:00,729
l was telling Mr. Leeson, l mean Daniel...

435
00:30:01,874 --> 00:30:06,368
about how badly we were doing,
and he thought maybe he could do better.

436
00:30:06,946 --> 00:30:10,575
l suppose you told him
there wasn't any coal in it, too.

437
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:15,414
Well, if you're interested,
you might bring around the data tomorrow.

438
00:30:15,588 --> 00:30:17,180
l'm very lucky.

439
00:30:17,724 --> 00:30:20,420
You know what they call me back home?

440
00:30:21,694 --> 00:30:23,127
l can guess.

441
00:31:54,053 --> 00:31:55,281
l just met her.

442
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:15,599
l guess it was easier for her
to change her name...

443
00:32:15,708 --> 00:32:18,609
than for a whole family to change theirs.

444
00:32:20,112 --> 00:32:22,171
That'd go great out West.

445
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:26,141
Seemed to go pretty well
with the cowboy here.

446
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:29,151
You want to change the subject?

447
00:32:29,222 --> 00:32:32,783
Why don't you two get up and dance?
Or don't you dance?

448
00:32:32,992 --> 00:32:35,620
Lucy doesn't care much about dancing.

449
00:32:35,695 --> 00:32:37,595
Didn't you know that?

450
00:32:40,766 --> 00:32:44,827
Did Lucy tell you that? She's holding out
on you. She's a beautiful dancer.

451
00:32:44,937 --> 00:32:48,429
Why, l used to call her ''Twinkle Toes.''
Hello, Twinkle Toes.

452
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:50,840
Have you been fooling me, you little rascal?

453
00:32:50,943 --> 00:32:53,969
Honestly, l didn't think
you cared much about it.

454
00:32:54,046 --> 00:32:57,345
Care about it?
Why, l could dance till the cows come home.

455
00:32:57,450 --> 00:32:59,850
l won several cups at it myself.

456
00:33:00,052 --> 00:33:01,986
We never won any cups.

457
00:33:03,623 --> 00:33:05,921
Maybe you had the wrong partner.

458
00:33:06,259 --> 00:33:08,591
There's a lot in what you say.

459
00:33:10,596 --> 00:33:13,463
-Can l have this waltz, Lucy?
-Of course.

460
00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:42,649
Here, give this to the orchestra leader
and tell him...

461
00:34:42,755 --> 00:34:45,690
-to play the same number again.
-Yes, sir.

462
00:35:44,884 --> 00:35:46,078
Come on, sing.

463
00:35:51,924 --> 00:35:53,289
lt's ''all day.''

464
00:35:53,392 --> 00:35:54,882
-l'm sorry.
-lt's all right.

465
00:36:30,963 --> 00:36:33,124
-Not bad.
-Thanks.

466
00:36:33,232 --> 00:36:35,393
-Never had a lesson in my life.
-You don't say.

467
00:36:35,468 --> 00:36:37,902
-Have you?
-Well, yes.

468
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:41,303
Let's sing another one.
That must be him now.

469
00:36:43,809 --> 00:36:46,209
-Hello, Warriner.
-Hello, Leeson.

470
00:36:47,113 --> 00:36:49,206
-Hello, Lucy.
-Hello, Jerry.

471
00:36:49,782 --> 00:36:52,012
-Glad you dropped up.
-Thanks.

472
00:36:53,319 --> 00:36:55,981
l really am very interested
in that mine of yours.

473
00:36:56,088 --> 00:36:59,580
Yes, l brought along all the records
and history of....

474
00:36:59,792 --> 00:37:03,250
l've looked all over for McCall's report
on that mine.

475
00:37:03,329 --> 00:37:06,321
-l can't find it anywhere. You must have it.
-Maybe l have.

476
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:10,198
Next chance you get,
look through your stocking drawer.

477
00:37:10,302 --> 00:37:13,601
She always hides important things
in the top drawer of her dresser.

478
00:37:13,672 --> 00:37:14,969
She does?

479
00:37:16,008 --> 00:37:19,171
Every legal paper we had smelled of sachet.

480
00:37:19,278 --> 00:37:20,472
lt did?

481
00:37:21,981 --> 00:37:24,313
Even the marriage certificate.

482
00:37:25,584 --> 00:37:29,179
Remember when the clerk asked to see it
and you couldn't find it?

483
00:37:29,288 --> 00:37:32,985
We had a bunch of pals at the hotel.
They kept ribbing us all night.

484
00:37:34,026 --> 00:37:38,258
Remember when they sent the bellboy?
We didn't want ice water.

485
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:41,657
No?

486
00:37:46,505 --> 00:37:48,132
What's the matter?

487
00:37:49,441 --> 00:37:52,968
When you two are married
the three of us can talk more freely.

488
00:37:53,312 --> 00:37:54,973
About this mine business...

489
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:58,743
this place was formerly owned
by the Fullerton Brothers. They....

490
00:38:04,924 --> 00:38:08,451
You've heard of the Fullerton Brothers,
haven't you?

491
00:38:08,527 --> 00:38:09,585
Yes.

492
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:13,291
lt seems they didn't know much
about the mining situation in Pennsylvania.

493
00:38:13,365 --> 00:38:15,993
-Their racket was mainly--
-Why, hello, Ma!

494
00:38:17,770 --> 00:38:19,635
-Hello.
-Hello, Mrs. Leeson.

495
00:38:19,738 --> 00:38:22,605
-Hello, Lucy.
-Ma, this is Mr. Jerry Warriner.

496
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:24,939
-Not--
-Yes, ma'am, that's right.

497
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:28,411
-We're discussing a business proposition.
-l see.

498
00:38:29,114 --> 00:38:31,480
-lt's funny seeing you.
-lt is?

499
00:38:32,318 --> 00:38:34,081
Well, it's funny seeing you.

500
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:38,020
What l mean is, l was at a tea this afternoon
where some people...

501
00:38:38,123 --> 00:38:40,990
were speaking of you and of Lucy, too.

502
00:38:41,293 --> 00:38:44,421
They knew you both before the divorce.

503
00:38:46,799 --> 00:38:50,462
l'll bet you run into dozens of people
who knew us before the divorce.

504
00:38:50,769 --> 00:38:53,431
Yes, we used to get around quite a lot.
Didn't we?

505
00:38:54,907 --> 00:38:59,105
They spoke very well of you.
They said you were a real gentleman.

506
00:38:59,178 --> 00:39:01,237
Oh, did they really?

507
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:04,108
And they were talking of Lucy, too.

508
00:39:04,583 --> 00:39:07,211
You know, you do sing divinely, dear.

509
00:39:07,286 --> 00:39:10,881
But l'd never realized till this afternoon
that you had a teacher...

510
00:39:10,956 --> 00:39:13,720
and a very handsome one, l understand.

511
00:39:15,227 --> 00:39:19,960
There was a woman there, if l hadn't been
a lady l would have slapped her face.

512
00:39:20,065 --> 00:39:23,466
-Why didn't you?
-l wish l had, because she insinuated....

513
00:39:23,602 --> 00:39:27,402
As a matter of fact,
she didn't even insinuate.

514
00:39:27,506 --> 00:39:31,340
Well, she was talking
about your divorcing Mr. Warriner.

515
00:39:33,946 --> 00:39:37,575
She came right out and said
that it should have been....

516
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:43,315
No matter, no matter.

517
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:48,219
-No matter.
-No matter.

518
00:39:48,294 --> 00:39:50,762
Let's get down to business, Leeson.

519
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:54,892
lf l'd had time to work this mine myself,
l'd have made a fortune.

520
00:39:54,967 --> 00:39:58,164
But l was always too busy
making money for other people.

521
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:01,535
There's a section up there
simply crying for someone to go in...

522
00:40:01,607 --> 00:40:03,905
who has the time and money to give it.

523
00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:08,607
l think if you could sink a shaft
in this north corner, right about here....

524
00:40:08,914 --> 00:40:10,711
Wait, let me show you something.

525
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:14,082
l ought to tell you, Jerry,
nobody is listening to you.

526
00:40:14,153 --> 00:40:16,644
The girl's name needs clearing, partner.

527
00:40:17,156 --> 00:40:19,784
l wouldn't go so far as to say that.

528
00:40:20,125 --> 00:40:23,390
But l'm sure Mr. Warriner
is pleased at the opportunity...

529
00:40:23,462 --> 00:40:26,090
to deny that silly story
l heard this afternoon.

530
00:40:26,198 --> 00:40:29,292
Why, certainly, Mrs. Leeson. What is it?

531
00:40:30,069 --> 00:40:35,473
This woman said Mr. Warriner permitted you
to bring proceedings so that....

532
00:40:36,275 --> 00:40:39,608
Well, so that your reputation
wouldn't be ruined.

533
00:40:39,712 --> 00:40:42,704
There, it's out. l know it's silly but--

534
00:40:42,781 --> 00:40:44,942
Of course it's silly, and so are you.

535
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:46,881
-What?
-See here, Warriner.

536
00:40:46,952 --> 00:40:50,752
l mean it's silly for your mother
to believe such nonsense.

537
00:40:50,856 --> 00:40:55,953
You see, our divorce was one of those
tragedies that you read about in the papers.

538
00:40:56,562 --> 00:40:59,554
A trusting woman and a worthless man.

539
00:41:00,432 --> 00:41:00,733
l was never good enough for Lucy
and finally she found it out.

540
00:41:00,733 --> 00:41:04,430
l was never good enough for Lucy
and finally she found it out.

541
00:41:04,737 --> 00:41:07,604
Lucy is above suspicion,
and always has been.

542
00:41:07,706 --> 00:41:12,405
She's as pure as the driven snow,
as faithful as she is fair.

543
00:41:14,046 --> 00:41:17,573
And l would that l had been worthy
to kiss the hem of her garment.

544
00:41:17,716 --> 00:41:21,243
Never during our marital bliss
did she cause me a moment's uneasiness.

545
00:41:21,353 --> 00:41:25,346
Never did l have to ask, ''Lucy, where
have you been, what were you doing?''

546
00:41:25,424 --> 00:41:26,789
l always knew.

547
00:41:28,394 --> 00:41:32,057
l tell you, something wonderful
went out of my life when l lost her.

548
00:41:32,131 --> 00:41:34,759
-l know just how you feel.
-How do you know?

549
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:39,304
How can you know how it feels to have
used up the best years of a woman's life?

550
00:41:46,211 --> 00:41:48,406
Of course, that's the way it goes.

551
00:41:48,514 --> 00:41:51,244
Excuse me, you're sitting on my prospectus.

552
00:41:53,585 --> 00:41:57,419
Dan, take those and look them over.

553
00:41:58,190 --> 00:42:00,055
And let me know. And, Dan...

554
00:42:00,692 --> 00:42:02,250
take good care of her.

555
00:42:03,629 --> 00:42:05,358
l'll be going now.

556
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:10,894
Yes, Dan, take good care of her.

557
00:42:11,036 --> 00:42:13,664
Maybe you'll succeed where l failed.

558
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:19,708
l'm sure that the three of you will be
very happy out where the West begins.

559
00:42:22,014 --> 00:42:24,380
lf you ever think of me, send me a postcard.

560
00:42:24,450 --> 00:42:28,784
Just say, ''Having a wonderful time.''
l'll understand.

561
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:35,390
Goodbye, now.

562
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:44,365
Ma, are you convinced about everything?

563
00:42:44,736 --> 00:42:46,863
What about the music teacher?

564
00:42:48,273 --> 00:42:52,073
You two try and settle things for yourselves.
Let me know how it comes out.

565
00:42:52,177 --> 00:42:55,044
Put a light in the window if it's yes,
two if it's no.

566
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:58,379
And if you can't make up your minds,
just pull down the shade.

567
00:43:20,405 --> 00:43:21,497
Hello.

568
00:43:21,573 --> 00:43:24,667
What are you doing in my apartment,
if l'm not too inquisitive?

569
00:43:24,743 --> 00:43:27,837
l thought after my swell reference
about you, l deserved a drink.

570
00:43:27,913 --> 00:43:31,076
-Wish l'd mixed it for you.
-l see what you mean.

571
00:43:32,918 --> 00:43:36,354
Certainly do appreciate
all the charming things you said about me.

572
00:43:36,421 --> 00:43:39,413
When l get the chance,
l hope l can do as much for you.

573
00:43:39,525 --> 00:43:42,085
lt was nothing at all.
l try to go through life--

574
00:43:42,194 --> 00:43:45,322
l know,
spreading a little sunshine as you go.

575
00:43:46,198 --> 00:43:48,894
No, frankly, l was worried about you.

576
00:43:50,269 --> 00:43:53,329
You've never asked for money.
Do you need any?

577
00:43:53,405 --> 00:43:56,568
No, l think l can struggle along
without any help from you.

578
00:43:56,675 --> 00:43:58,973
l thought maybe you made
a bad investment.

579
00:43:59,044 --> 00:44:02,571
-No. l only made one bad investment.
-Don't bite me.

580
00:44:02,981 --> 00:44:07,475
l thought that maybe Buffalo Bill's millions
might have something to do--

581
00:44:07,553 --> 00:44:09,145
Nothing to do with anything.

582
00:44:09,221 --> 00:44:12,088
Millions or no millions,
he's a very charming person.

583
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:13,419
l've seen him.

584
00:44:15,327 --> 00:44:17,887
l can't possibly interpret this as jealousy.

585
00:44:17,996 --> 00:44:19,156
No.

586
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:23,168
l've come out from behind those clouds.

587
00:44:23,735 --> 00:44:26,295
l've taken a definite turn for the better.

588
00:44:26,505 --> 00:44:28,803
Nothing's going to hurt me anymore.

589
00:44:32,177 --> 00:44:34,077
That's too bad, Jerry.

590
00:44:34,413 --> 00:44:36,711
-Did it hurt you much?
-No.

591
00:44:36,882 --> 00:44:39,510
-Just the one hand?
-Just the one hand.

592
00:44:40,752 --> 00:44:43,880
l'll be going.
l always like to leave people laughing.

593
00:44:43,989 --> 00:44:46,014
ls there anything l can get you for it?

594
00:44:46,124 --> 00:44:48,786
No, l'm a stout fellow, l'll carry on.

595
00:44:50,729 --> 00:44:53,197
-Where's Mr. Smith?
-Out with Aunt Patsy.

596
00:44:55,901 --> 00:44:58,233
Tell me something before l go, will you?

597
00:44:58,704 --> 00:45:01,537
-What do you see in this fellow?
-None of your business.

598
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:06,373
Not that l care, but what kind of a line
could he have that would impress you?

599
00:45:06,478 --> 00:45:10,380
You might be surprised. You could take
a few lessons and profit nicely.

600
00:45:10,749 --> 00:45:13,809
You'd be surprised what l'd give
to get an earful of that.

601
00:45:13,885 --> 00:45:16,046
-You would.
-l couldn't wait to see you.

602
00:45:16,154 --> 00:45:18,884
l had to tell you
how awful l feel about what happened.

603
00:45:18,991 --> 00:45:21,824
You'll have to forgive Ma.
She's kind of old-fashioned.

604
00:45:21,893 --> 00:45:24,327
-l'll forgive her.
-You won't hold it against her?

605
00:45:24,396 --> 00:45:27,490
No. Now you go and dress for dinner.
We'll be very late.

606
00:45:27,799 --> 00:45:29,528
l'm a lot quicker than you are.

607
00:45:29,635 --> 00:45:32,900
Just to prove that you're not mad,
will you give me a little kiss?

608
00:45:33,005 --> 00:45:36,236
-Right here in the hall? Don't be silly.
-There's nobody around.

609
00:45:36,341 --> 00:45:39,105
-You never can tell if someone's around.
-l'll come in.

610
00:45:39,177 --> 00:45:41,839
Don't come in. We'll be awfully late.

611
00:45:41,947 --> 00:45:43,847
-Don't be bashful.
-l'm not bashful.

612
00:45:43,949 --> 00:45:47,885
l've never kissed you before.
And l don't think this is exactly the place.

613
00:45:47,986 --> 00:45:52,047
lf you knew how crazy l am about you,
you wouldn't hesitate. l can't sleep nights.

614
00:45:52,157 --> 00:45:54,682
-Try drinking some hot milk.
-l must be in love...

615
00:45:54,793 --> 00:45:57,660
-because l started writing poetry to you.
-Poetry.

616
00:45:57,729 --> 00:46:02,029
l was going to surprise you with it at dinner,
but it's short. lt goes like this:

617
00:46:02,868 --> 00:46:07,430
''To you, my little prairie flower
l'm thinking of you every hour

618
00:46:07,539 --> 00:46:11,635
''Though now you're just a friend to me
l wonder what the end will be''

619
00:46:12,844 --> 00:46:16,109
Excuse me, Dan,
l do laugh at the oddest times.

620
00:46:17,683 --> 00:46:19,480
You see what l mean?

621
00:46:25,891 --> 00:46:28,655
''Oh, you would make my life divine

622
00:46:28,727 --> 00:46:31,662
''if you would change your name to mine''

623
00:46:33,098 --> 00:46:34,429
That's really....

624
00:46:34,499 --> 00:46:38,128
That's beautiful, Dan.
lt's really beautiful. There's my phone.

625
00:46:38,203 --> 00:46:40,831
You've got to go now, really.

626
00:46:41,306 --> 00:46:43,433
-Hello.
-Comment a va, madame?

627
00:46:43,942 --> 00:46:47,935
-You haven't forgotten about tomorrow?
-Look, l have company.

628
00:46:49,614 --> 00:46:52,515
All right, wait a minute, hold the phone.

629
00:46:55,220 --> 00:46:58,485
There, now go on, Dan, l'll see you later.

630
00:47:03,328 --> 00:47:06,627
Lucy, you've made me
the happiest man in the world.

631
00:47:06,698 --> 00:47:11,431
Dreamed of this moment for days,
now it's all come true.

632
00:47:12,137 --> 00:47:13,604
Dan, really!

633
00:47:14,506 --> 00:47:19,375
l'll go home now and dress for dinner.
l'm so happy l could eat three steaks.

634
00:47:24,015 --> 00:47:25,277
Hello?

635
00:47:34,826 --> 00:47:35,850
Telephone.

636
00:47:39,498 --> 00:47:40,522
Hello?

637
00:47:40,665 --> 00:47:42,428
Can l expect you tomorrow?

638
00:47:42,501 --> 00:47:46,699
At 3:00 tomorrow afternoon?
l think that would be convenient.

639
00:47:47,639 --> 00:47:50,506
Very well then, 3:00 tomorrow afternoon.
Goodbye.

640
00:47:51,943 --> 00:47:54,673
-Who was that?
-Why should it interest you?

641
00:47:55,781 --> 00:47:58,750
Wait a minute, after all,
the final decree isn't in yet.

642
00:47:58,817 --> 00:48:01,615
-lf you must know, it was my masseuse.
-My who?

643
00:48:03,155 --> 00:48:06,955
l've heard everything. l'm going out
to get some popcorn and pink lemonade.

644
00:48:07,025 --> 00:48:09,653
l've just seen a three-ring circus.

645
00:48:27,112 --> 00:48:28,807
Armand Duvalle in?

646
00:48:28,914 --> 00:48:31,712
-Please, your name?
-Jerry Warriner. ls my wife here?

647
00:48:31,817 --> 00:48:33,148
l do not know.

648
00:48:33,785 --> 00:48:35,719
What do you mean you don't know?

649
00:48:35,887 --> 00:48:39,288
-l only know l don't know.
-You wouldn't mind if l look around.

650
00:48:39,391 --> 00:48:40,653
Me, jujitsu.

651
00:48:47,065 --> 00:48:48,965
-Me, jujitsu.
-ls that so?

652
00:48:53,371 --> 00:48:54,804
Me, jujitsu, too.

653
00:48:56,575 --> 00:48:59,442
You must not go in.
You must not disturb him.

654
00:48:59,544 --> 00:49:02,206
l can't go in, he must not be disturbed.

655
00:50:09,114 --> 00:50:12,106
You should have seen your master
this afternoon.

656
00:50:12,551 --> 00:50:14,416
Come on, sit up, boy.

657
00:50:17,455 --> 00:50:19,218
No, better still, l tell you...

658
00:50:19,291 --> 00:50:22,021
go hide your eyes
and l'll give it to you that way.

659
00:50:24,129 --> 00:50:28,190
Five, ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty-five.
No peeking.

660
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:32,595
Five, ten, fifteen, twenty,
twenty-five, thirty, thirty-five. You ready?

661
00:50:32,704 --> 00:50:35,264
All right, then, come on.

662
00:50:36,207 --> 00:50:37,902
You're too smart.

663
00:50:39,244 --> 00:50:42,213
Honestly, Patsy,
you should have seen Jerry this afternoon.

664
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:45,681
And when that chair
started to slip from under him.

665
00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:49,914
-l will say that for Jerry, he's never dull.
-He was so silly, though.

666
00:50:50,021 --> 00:50:52,854
l know he thought he'd find me
in Armand's arms.

667
00:50:52,924 --> 00:50:55,085
He must have been terribly disappointed.

668
00:50:55,193 --> 00:50:59,027
He must have felt awful
about not finding you two in a clinch.

669
00:50:59,097 --> 00:51:03,033
Jerry's always had the most fantastic way
of getting into scrapes.

670
00:51:03,101 --> 00:51:05,365
We've had some grand laughs together.

671
00:51:05,437 --> 00:51:08,167
But a girl really wants
dependability and security.

672
00:51:08,239 --> 00:51:09,604
Yes, l suppose she does.

673
00:51:09,708 --> 00:51:12,609
Then she ought to buy an annuity.
Be more fun than Leeson.

674
00:51:12,711 --> 00:51:15,179
Don't explain. l'm not marrying him.

675
00:51:15,246 --> 00:51:18,511
That's what l wanted to tell you.
l'm not either.

676
00:51:19,017 --> 00:51:22,646
l can't marry him because l'm still in love
with that crazy lunatic.

677
00:51:22,721 --> 00:51:25,485
And there's nothing l can do about it.

678
00:51:27,258 --> 00:51:30,489
Patsy, here and there, now and then...

679
00:51:30,562 --> 00:51:33,554
-l've done a few things for you, haven't l?
-Yes.

680
00:51:33,665 --> 00:51:38,102
Here's a note that l've written to Dan
explaining exactly why l can't marry him.

681
00:51:38,203 --> 00:51:42,105
l could never phrase anything in person
as beautifully as l have in this note.

682
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:44,731
But now l've lost my nerve
about giving it to him.

683
00:51:44,843 --> 00:51:47,903
-Could you sort of see that he gets it?
-l should say so.

684
00:51:48,013 --> 00:51:50,379
Well, l tried to forget Jerry.

685
00:51:51,516 --> 00:51:52,540
l know.

686
00:51:52,684 --> 00:51:56,677
That's why you jumped at Leeson
as if he were the last man on earth.

687
00:51:56,855 --> 00:51:58,550
l'll answer that.

688
00:52:04,496 --> 00:52:07,431
Every time l open the door
somebody walks in.

689
00:52:07,532 --> 00:52:09,363
-How do you do?
-How do you do?

690
00:52:13,672 --> 00:52:15,833
-Hello, Armand.
-You sent for me, madam.

691
00:52:15,907 --> 00:52:18,705
Yes, l've been so embarrassed
about what happened...

692
00:52:18,810 --> 00:52:21,904
in front of your guests
l couldn't get out of there soon enough.

693
00:52:22,013 --> 00:52:24,743
Your husband is a very funny man, isn't he?

694
00:52:24,849 --> 00:52:28,683
l'm convinced he must care about me
or he wouldn't do those funny things.

695
00:52:28,753 --> 00:52:31,313
Yes, but he doesn't care much about me.

696
00:52:31,389 --> 00:52:34,756
No, Armand, that's just what l'm getting at.

697
00:52:36,094 --> 00:52:39,689
-l'm wondering, could you do me a favor?
-But of course.

698
00:52:39,898 --> 00:52:41,365
l've been thinking...

699
00:52:43,234 --> 00:52:45,361
l wonder if you could convince him...

700
00:52:45,470 --> 00:52:48,906
that everything was just as l said it was
that night at the inn.

701
00:52:49,007 --> 00:52:50,565
l'd be glad to.

702
00:52:50,675 --> 00:52:53,508
But does he carry a gun?

703
00:52:53,645 --> 00:52:55,044
You're not afraid of him?

704
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:59,372
-Of course not, but--
-Will you do it for me? As soon as possible?

705
00:52:59,484 --> 00:53:00,508
Yes.

706
00:53:00,585 --> 00:53:04,146
And, by all means, he mustn't know
that l had anything to do with it.

707
00:53:04,222 --> 00:53:06,122
-No.
-As soon as possible.

708
00:53:10,829 --> 00:53:13,127
Mr. Smith! How are you?

709
00:53:14,699 --> 00:53:16,826
-But this is much too soon.
-lsn't it?

710
00:53:16,901 --> 00:53:19,199
-Much too soon.
-What can l do?

711
00:53:19,304 --> 00:53:22,000
-You can't keep standing here.
-l know, but where can l go?

712
00:53:22,073 --> 00:53:23,540
-Look, out here.
-No.

713
00:53:23,641 --> 00:53:25,074
Look, in the bedroom. Hurry up.

714
00:53:30,281 --> 00:53:32,613
-Hiya, fellow.
-Hello, Jerry.

715
00:53:32,684 --> 00:53:35,380
-Hello, Patsy. How have you been?
-Fine.

716
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:38,284
You knew it was me, didn't you?
Sure you did.

717
00:53:43,628 --> 00:53:46,358
You remembered me, didn't you?
Sure, you bet.

718
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:50,961
Get away.

719
00:53:52,670 --> 00:53:55,503
-Hello, Jerry.
-Hello, Lucy.

720
00:53:55,774 --> 00:53:58,971
-l suppose you know why l dropped in.
-No, l don't exactly.

721
00:53:59,043 --> 00:54:03,537
As a matter of fact, l came to apologize for
my behavior today in Duvalle's apartment...

722
00:54:03,648 --> 00:54:06,515
-studio, or whatever he calls his joint.
-Oh, that?

723
00:54:06,618 --> 00:54:09,314
l certainly acted like a prize lunatic,
and l'm sorry.

724
00:54:09,387 --> 00:54:11,719
-lt was nothing at all.
-Nothing?

725
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:15,522
Nothing except the most ridiculous
and sickening exhibition...

726
00:54:15,627 --> 00:54:17,458
mortal man ever made of himself.

727
00:54:17,695 --> 00:54:19,560
l don't know why l act like that.

728
00:54:19,664 --> 00:54:22,531
Unless it's because of the effect
that Duvalle has on me.

729
00:54:22,634 --> 00:54:25,501
l never knew anyone
that can aggravate me the way he does.

730
00:54:25,603 --> 00:54:29,334
-l can't think about him without seeing red.
-You shouldn't get so excited.

731
00:54:29,474 --> 00:54:32,875
A mere mention of his name
and l feel positively murderous.

732
00:54:32,977 --> 00:54:34,274
You do?

733
00:54:36,648 --> 00:54:38,809
-What's the matter with you?
-Nothing.

734
00:54:38,883 --> 00:54:42,375
l was just thinking about your problem.
You certainly have a problem.

735
00:54:42,487 --> 00:54:45,354
l know l have a problem,
and l know how l feel, too.

736
00:54:45,623 --> 00:54:48,114
l guess there's nothing l can do about it.

737
00:54:52,630 --> 00:54:54,359
Look at Mr. Smith.

738
00:54:55,266 --> 00:54:57,598
-l guess he wants to play.
-Yes.

739
00:54:59,470 --> 00:55:01,961
Here, you go and hide it for him.

740
00:55:03,608 --> 00:55:05,633
No fair peeking, Smitty.

741
00:55:20,091 --> 00:55:22,184
All right, let's go. Come on.

742
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:24,487
Oh, no, you're cold.

743
00:55:24,596 --> 00:55:26,427
You're colder than ice. Cold, cold.

744
00:55:26,497 --> 00:55:28,863
Oh, boy, what's wrong with you?

745
00:55:33,204 --> 00:55:35,968
Nice going, fellow. Let it go. Good boy.

746
00:55:37,976 --> 00:55:39,500
Well, Lucy...

747
00:55:42,814 --> 00:55:45,908
the main idea is, do you accept my apology?

748
00:55:48,419 --> 00:55:52,685
Besides making a blue-ribbon sap of myself
today, l must have embarrassed you terribly.

749
00:55:52,790 --> 00:55:54,155
You took it fine, though.

750
00:55:54,259 --> 00:55:56,921
-You must admit you were--
-Yes.

751
00:55:57,295 --> 00:56:01,425
-What was that?
-Nothing, just an old mirror.

752
00:56:02,934 --> 00:56:06,461
-The boy's getting worse every day.
-Mr. Smith, that's a fine thing.

753
00:56:06,571 --> 00:56:08,903
l'm surprised at you.
Trying to get rid of me?

754
00:56:08,973 --> 00:56:11,737
No, he wasn't trying to get rid of you,
you know it.

755
00:56:12,410 --> 00:56:15,504
Well, l really hadn't planned
to leave so soon.

756
00:56:15,613 --> 00:56:19,640
l thought, if you have nothing to do,
you might like to go for a drive with me.

757
00:56:19,784 --> 00:56:23,345
Well, the air will do you good,
and we can talk things over?

758
00:56:23,454 --> 00:56:26,582
-l'd love that. Yes, it would do me good.
-Swell.

759
00:56:26,658 --> 00:56:29,126
-Where's your car?
-Downstairs, in the garage.

760
00:56:29,193 --> 00:56:33,789
While l'm changing,
you get the car and l'll meet you out front.

761
00:56:33,898 --> 00:56:36,389
-Okay, dear.
-l won't be a minute.

762
00:56:56,187 --> 00:56:59,486
That's funny, l only bought the hat
an hour ago and look at it.

763
00:56:59,724 --> 00:57:01,385
Did you have a haircut, maybe?

764
00:57:02,427 --> 00:57:04,258
-No.
-No?

765
00:57:04,395 --> 00:57:07,626
Maybe you have it on backwards.
Put it on the other way around.

766
00:57:07,732 --> 00:57:10,428
Well, l hadn't thought of that. Wait a minute.

767
00:57:14,138 --> 00:57:16,834
Yes, there, now that's more becoming.

768
00:57:23,247 --> 00:57:26,478
lt is a bit roomy. Maybe they're wearing
them that way this year.

769
00:57:26,584 --> 00:57:27,642
Well, l'm not.

770
00:57:28,953 --> 00:57:30,386
Looks mighty funny to me.

771
00:57:30,455 --> 00:57:33,390
Look at your ears. That's why.
Your ears are all down.

772
00:57:33,458 --> 00:57:35,085
What's wrong with it?

773
00:57:35,159 --> 00:57:37,627
-Stick your ears up underneath.
-Don't be silly.

774
00:57:37,729 --> 00:57:40,289
How can you stick your ears up?
That's no good.

775
00:57:40,331 --> 00:57:41,559
Well, l always put my ears in.

776
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:52,073
-Who's there?
-Me, and my ma.

777
00:57:53,878 --> 00:57:56,972
Lucy, l've caused you enough trouble
for one day.

778
00:57:57,081 --> 00:58:00,107
He better not find me here.
l'll duck in the other room.

779
00:58:00,251 --> 00:58:01,275
No, no, but....

780
00:58:03,221 --> 00:58:04,381
Could you....

781
00:58:11,629 --> 00:58:13,460
-Hello, there.
-Hello, Aunt Patsy.

782
00:58:13,564 --> 00:58:15,259
Good evening, Mrs. Leeson.

783
00:58:15,366 --> 00:58:16,799
Good evening, Mrs. Leeson.

784
00:58:16,901 --> 00:58:20,359
Lucy, you didn't come over this morning
the way you usually do.

785
00:58:20,438 --> 00:58:24,204
-l was so busy this morning.
-That's what l kept telling you, Ma.

786
00:58:24,275 --> 00:58:27,267
-Do you mind if l sit down?
-No, not at all.

787
00:58:33,551 --> 00:58:36,884
-l've got an awful headache.
-Well, l'm getting one.

788
00:58:37,255 --> 00:58:41,351
l thought maybe you were angry
at my repeating what that awful....

789
00:58:41,959 --> 00:58:44,052
Nonsense, Mrs. Leeson.

790
00:58:44,429 --> 00:58:48,092
-What on earth was that?
-Somebody's cleaning up in there.

791
00:58:51,069 --> 00:58:52,434
l was afraid....

792
00:58:53,371 --> 00:58:55,271
-Must they do that?
-Yes--

793
00:58:57,475 --> 00:59:01,309
l was afraid, but l knew that in your heart
you knew...

794
00:59:01,412 --> 00:59:03,380
that l never suspected you.

795
00:59:03,614 --> 00:59:05,275
Of course not, Mrs. Leeson.

796
00:59:05,383 --> 00:59:11,049
The first time Dan talked about you, l said,
''Why, she sounds like a sweet little thing.''

797
00:59:11,155 --> 00:59:13,885
Why, to know Lucy is to love her.

798
00:59:14,258 --> 00:59:17,489
Lucy, l got a surprise for you.
Ma and l talked it all over.

799
00:59:17,562 --> 00:59:21,054
l hope you are going to like Oklahoma,
because l'm going to ask you....

800
00:59:22,567 --> 00:59:23,932
Excuse me.

801
00:59:26,938 --> 00:59:28,929
They forgot to touch second.

802
00:59:36,214 --> 00:59:37,704
Come on, Dan.

803
00:59:38,683 --> 00:59:41,948
Well, l guess a man's best friend
is his mother.

804
00:59:46,357 --> 00:59:49,019
l certainly learned about women from you.

805
00:59:49,727 --> 00:59:52,287
-Here's your diploma.
-Come on.

806
01:00:00,505 --> 01:00:02,996
What's the matter with you, Smitty?

807
01:00:05,676 --> 01:00:08,440
l see what you mean. Patsy, look at this.

808
01:00:10,314 --> 01:00:12,544
Oh, yes, that's Barbara Vance.

809
01:00:12,650 --> 01:00:16,017
-You know who she is, don't you?
-Yes, l know who she is.

810
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:19,214
The madcap heiress. lsn't that
what the papers usually call her?

811
01:00:19,323 --> 01:00:23,783
Millions of dollars and no sense.
l wonder what she's doing with Jerry.

812
01:00:23,861 --> 01:00:26,659
Entertaining him,
running around town with him...

813
01:00:26,764 --> 01:00:29,460
and l imagine falling in love with him.
That's all.

814
01:00:29,534 --> 01:00:32,264
-You can't tell all that from this picture.
-No.

815
01:00:32,336 --> 01:00:37,467
But l can tell it from what l've heard.
lf rumor is true, Barbara is quite a girl.

816
01:00:37,542 --> 01:00:38,975
And Jerry's having a lot of fun.

817
01:01:50,114 --> 01:01:51,274
Come in.

818
01:01:53,117 --> 01:01:54,141
Hello, Jerry.

819
01:01:55,486 --> 01:01:58,080
Hello, Lucy, what's the nature of this visit?

820
01:01:58,322 --> 01:02:00,517
Well, l just thought l'd....

821
01:02:00,625 --> 01:02:02,650
-Do you know what today is?
-Certainly.

822
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:06,594
Our divorce becomes final today.
Tomorrow, we'll both be back in circulation.

823
01:02:06,664 --> 01:02:09,497
l just thought l'd drop up
and wish you a lot of luck.

824
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:13,092
That's very nice of you.
Would you like to join me for some wine?

825
01:02:13,170 --> 01:02:14,933
Of course l would.

826
01:02:16,741 --> 01:02:20,837
That was a cute picture of you and Barbara
in the morning paper.

827
01:02:22,747 --> 01:02:26,012
l love the caption: ''Off with the old love.''

828
01:02:26,117 --> 01:02:28,984
l thought ''Out of the frying pan''
might have been better.

829
01:02:29,086 --> 01:02:30,110
ls that so?

830
01:02:30,655 --> 01:02:34,489
Well, l think that Barbara and l
will be very happy together.

831
01:02:34,592 --> 01:02:36,560
l'm sure you'll be very happy.

832
01:02:36,794 --> 01:02:40,389
Only l don't think
you'll be as happy as Daniel and l.

833
01:02:41,766 --> 01:02:42,926
What?

834
01:02:44,402 --> 01:02:47,894
-ls that still on?
-What do you mean, ''ls that still on?''

835
01:02:48,839 --> 01:02:51,000
After that two-men-in-a-bedroom farce...

836
01:02:51,108 --> 01:02:54,168
l sort of imagined that when we left, he left.

837
01:02:54,278 --> 01:02:57,679
Oh, no. l just explained things to him
very simply.

838
01:02:57,982 --> 01:02:59,074
Oh, did you?

839
01:02:59,150 --> 01:03:01,118
Did you say our cars broke down...

840
01:03:01,185 --> 01:03:04,245
and we had to stay at your place
because of the taxi strike?

841
01:03:04,322 --> 01:03:06,916
No, l didn't tell him that. l told him the truth.

842
01:03:06,991 --> 01:03:09,391
And, strangely enough, he believed me.

843
01:03:09,460 --> 01:03:11,052
Yes, it was very refreshing.

844
01:03:11,128 --> 01:03:13,255
Well, what shall we drink to?

845
01:03:13,464 --> 01:03:15,625
Let's drink to our future.

846
01:03:17,635 --> 01:03:20,798
Here's hoping you and Barbara
will be very happy...

847
01:03:20,905 --> 01:03:22,930
which l doubt very much.

848
01:03:23,341 --> 01:03:25,901
Let's drink to your happiness
with Buffalo Bill...

849
01:03:25,976 --> 01:03:28,706
-Good.
-...which doesn't even make sense.

850
01:03:29,914 --> 01:03:32,781
-l'll tell you. We'll drink to the two of us.
-Good.

851
01:03:33,250 --> 01:03:35,616
As we go down life's highway...

852
01:03:35,953 --> 01:03:37,978
you going your way...

853
01:03:38,489 --> 01:03:40,286
and l going my way.

854
01:03:41,926 --> 01:03:43,621
-Okay?
-All right.

855
01:03:47,431 --> 01:03:48,898
lt's flat.

856
01:03:49,467 --> 01:03:51,594
l'll open another bottle.

857
01:03:55,106 --> 01:03:59,065
You'll have to hurry it up though
because l'm meeting Daniel.

858
01:04:02,380 --> 01:04:06,111
l think champagne is so fitting
to round out our romance.

859
01:04:06,984 --> 01:04:09,714
l remember the first drink
we ever had together.

860
01:04:09,787 --> 01:04:12,278
You, in your very best manner, said:

861
01:04:12,390 --> 01:04:14,415
''lt must be champagne.''

862
01:04:14,725 --> 01:04:16,989
And then you offered a toast,
you remember?

863
01:04:17,094 --> 01:04:20,359
-No, l don't.
-Well, being a woman, l do.

864
01:04:20,798 --> 01:04:22,265
You said....

865
01:04:23,801 --> 01:04:25,428
This'll land you a laugh.

866
01:04:26,303 --> 01:04:27,770
You said:

867
01:04:29,140 --> 01:04:31,768
''Lend an ear, l implore you

868
01:04:32,710 --> 01:04:37,306
''This comes from my heart
l'll always adore you

869
01:04:38,315 --> 01:04:40,374
''Till death do us part''

870
01:04:44,655 --> 01:04:45,986
Remember?

871
01:04:52,363 --> 01:04:54,228
lt was pretty swell.

872
01:04:55,132 --> 01:04:57,191
l mean, while it lasted.

873
01:04:59,970 --> 01:05:02,404
All beautiful things must end...

874
01:05:03,607 --> 01:05:06,303
so l guess we may as well call it a day.

875
01:05:10,548 --> 01:05:13,073
lf you don't mind, l'll call a car.

876
01:05:19,623 --> 01:05:23,457
Would you call a car for me?
Right away, please.

877
01:05:27,798 --> 01:05:29,026
Hello?

878
01:05:29,767 --> 01:05:31,701
Who's this, may l ask?

879
01:05:32,436 --> 01:05:37,305
lt's what's-her-name. l only said hello.
Maybe you can pick it up from there.

880
01:05:37,942 --> 01:05:41,844
-Did you have to answer my phone?
-l thought it was about the car. l'm sorry.

881
01:05:41,912 --> 01:05:43,846
What am l going to tell her?

882
01:05:44,281 --> 01:05:47,409
You can think of something.
You always could.

883
01:05:48,118 --> 01:05:52,214
-l haven't time to think of anything.
-Tell her you'll call her back.

884
01:05:52,790 --> 01:05:56,851
-How can l tell her l'll call her back?
-Then tell her to call you back.

885
01:05:58,262 --> 01:06:00,196
Hello? Hello, darling.

886
01:06:00,965 --> 01:06:04,696
Well, it took you long enough.
Have you decided who the woman is?

887
01:06:04,768 --> 01:06:07,737
lsn't that funny,
l knew you were going to ask me that.

888
01:06:07,838 --> 01:06:09,897
-So did l.
-Quiet.

889
01:06:11,575 --> 01:06:13,566
lt's very simple, dear. lt's my sister.

890
01:06:13,644 --> 01:06:16,704
Your sister?
How are you going to get out of that?

891
01:06:16,914 --> 01:06:19,712
She just got back from Paris,
dropped in to see me.

892
01:06:19,783 --> 01:06:21,444
Jerry, you're slipping.

893
01:06:22,052 --> 01:06:27,046
l'd love to meet your sister.
Why don't you bring her along tonight?

894
01:06:27,124 --> 01:06:30,093
She can't come this evening.
She has a previous engagement.

895
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:32,128
She wants me to come over?

896
01:06:32,229 --> 01:06:34,720
Naturally she's anxious
to meet you, too, but....

897
01:06:34,798 --> 01:06:38,632
Yes, tell her l'd love to meet her.
Tell her to wear boxing gloves.

898
01:06:39,303 --> 01:06:42,272
She said she'll break her engagement
and come over later.

899
01:06:42,373 --> 01:06:44,773
-But l strongly doubt that....
-Yes, l doubt it.

900
01:06:44,875 --> 01:06:48,572
Dear, l'll do my best to fix it up
so the two of you meet very soon.

901
01:06:48,646 --> 01:06:50,443
-Yes. Goodbye.
-That'd be lovely.

902
01:06:52,416 --> 01:06:54,941
l'm in a fine fix.
She wants to meet my sister.

903
01:06:55,052 --> 01:06:58,783
-You're a big help.
-You know me. Anything l can do....

904
01:06:59,056 --> 01:07:01,616
-What? To break it up?
-l see what you mean.

905
01:07:01,725 --> 01:07:03,522
l'm in a fine mess.

906
01:07:05,296 --> 01:07:08,094
Yes, hello? l did it again.

907
01:07:08,599 --> 01:07:10,863
What does she do? Call every five minutes?

908
01:07:10,935 --> 01:07:13,699
-You shouldn't take that from anybody.
-Hello, Barbara.

909
01:07:13,771 --> 01:07:15,136
Put your foot down....

910
01:07:15,239 --> 01:07:19,232
-l told you she couldn't make it this evening.
-She can't get away with it.

911
01:07:19,310 --> 01:07:22,609
There's no reason to call me
every five minutes about it, is there?

912
01:07:22,713 --> 01:07:24,544
No. Well, all right.

913
01:07:34,258 --> 01:07:36,954
-Good evening, Mr. Warriner.
-Good evening.

914
01:07:47,204 --> 01:07:48,865
-Hello, Barbara.
-Hello.

915
01:07:49,073 --> 01:07:50,700
Good evening, Mrs. Vance.

916
01:07:50,774 --> 01:07:52,605
-Hello, Mr. Vance.
-Jerry.

917
01:07:52,743 --> 01:07:54,574
Where's your sister?

918
01:07:55,546 --> 01:07:58,379
She was terribly sorry
she couldn't be here tonight.

919
01:07:58,449 --> 01:08:02,545
She didn't weather the boat trip well.
When l left, she was calling the doctor.

920
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:05,680
You can imagine my surprise
when a woman answered the phone.

921
01:08:05,756 --> 01:08:08,054
You can't blame me for being suspicious.

922
01:08:08,125 --> 01:08:11,754
Barbara, you can't have a happy married life
if you're always suspicious.

923
01:08:12,262 --> 01:08:14,025
There can't be doubts in marriage.

924
01:08:14,098 --> 01:08:17,556
Marriage is based on faith.
lf you lose that, you've lost everything.

925
01:08:17,668 --> 01:08:19,568
Very well said, Jerry.

926
01:08:19,737 --> 01:08:23,332
Yes, wasn't it?
l think l read it in a book or something.

927
01:08:24,041 --> 01:08:27,568
l was just thinking,
will your sister be here for the wedding?

928
01:08:28,445 --> 01:08:33,007
-l doubt that very much, Mrs. Vance.
-Maybe l should ask her to be a bridesmaid.

929
01:08:34,118 --> 01:08:37,053
l think she's sailing back to Paris
almost immediately.

930
01:08:37,121 --> 01:08:39,521
She said she'll try
to see you before she goes.

931
01:08:39,590 --> 01:08:41,558
You'd like my sister. She's your type.

932
01:08:41,659 --> 01:08:43,684
-Where did she go to school?
-Excuse me?

933
01:08:43,761 --> 01:08:46,992
-l said, where did she go to school?
-ln Switzerland.

934
01:08:48,098 --> 01:08:52,535
-You say your father was a Princeton man?
-That's right, sir. Class of '92.

935
01:08:53,070 --> 01:08:55,937
He tells some funny stories
about the place in those days.

936
01:08:56,040 --> 01:08:58,531
He tells one in particular
about a football game.

937
01:08:58,609 --> 01:09:01,100
lt seems Yale was playing
Princeton one day...

938
01:09:01,211 --> 01:09:05,170
and with the ball
on Princeton's two yard line, Yale fumbled.

939
01:09:05,249 --> 01:09:08,582
A minute to go, Dad picked up the ball,
and ran....

940
01:09:09,653 --> 01:09:11,678
Miss Lola Warriner.

941
01:09:26,103 --> 01:09:28,731
Hello, brother dear. l made it.

942
01:09:31,175 --> 01:09:33,166
What did you say, dear?

943
01:09:34,211 --> 01:09:38,341
-l just asked how you were feeling.
-l'm feeling fine. And you?

944
01:09:40,884 --> 01:09:43,216
Mrs. Vance, may l present my sister, Lola.

945
01:09:43,320 --> 01:09:44,651
How do you do?

946
01:09:44,722 --> 01:09:47,350
-lt's lovely to know you.
-Thank you.

947
01:09:47,891 --> 01:09:50,223
-Won't you come in?
-Thank you.

948
01:09:56,700 --> 01:09:59,533
-Barbara, this is Lola.
-How do you do?

949
01:09:59,636 --> 01:10:01,501
lt's nice to be able to meet you.

950
01:10:01,572 --> 01:10:04,166
l've seen your pictures,
and wondered how you look.

951
01:10:04,241 --> 01:10:06,801
-l wondered about you, too.
-Well, thank you.

952
01:10:06,877 --> 01:10:08,572
-Lola?
-Yes, dear?

953
01:10:09,213 --> 01:10:11,477
This is Barbara's father, Mr. Vance.

954
01:10:11,548 --> 01:10:13,914
-Mr. Vance, my sister.
-How do you do?

955
01:10:15,052 --> 01:10:16,747
What's the matter?

956
01:10:16,854 --> 01:10:20,585
Nothing, only l never would have known you
from his description.

957
01:10:20,691 --> 01:10:23,524
-Won't you sit down?
-Thank you.

958
01:10:31,902 --> 01:10:36,066
Did l interrupt something?
Weren't you talking when l came in for....

959
01:10:36,573 --> 01:10:38,973
Would you excuse me, Mrs. Vance?
My handkerchief.

960
01:10:39,042 --> 01:10:40,304
Thank you.

961
01:10:42,045 --> 01:10:45,071
lt's me. lsn't that silly?

962
01:10:48,752 --> 01:10:50,515
lt's you this time, Mrs. Vance.

963
01:10:50,587 --> 01:10:54,045
Look, l'll just put it over here,
and get it out of the way.

964
01:10:56,293 --> 01:10:57,317
Dear!

965
01:10:57,394 --> 01:11:00,124
l guess that could go on and on and on.

966
01:11:00,197 --> 01:11:01,528
l hope not.

967
01:11:04,635 --> 01:11:06,296
Go on with your story, honey.

968
01:11:06,370 --> 01:11:09,533
Yes, l was telling a story about my,
about our father.

969
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:10,902
Oh, you were?

970
01:11:11,008 --> 01:11:14,239
l don't want to be rude,
but may l have a drink?

971
01:11:14,978 --> 01:11:19,677
l had three or four before l came, but
they're wearing off, you know how that is.

972
01:11:21,618 --> 01:11:25,884
Don't look at me like that.
You like a little drink yourself.

973
01:11:27,524 --> 01:11:29,822
We call him Jerry the Nipper.

974
01:11:30,394 --> 01:11:34,558
Likes to sneak it when nobody's looking.
So cute about it, too.

975
01:11:35,132 --> 01:11:38,363
l've seen him go an evening,
apparently having nothing to drink...

976
01:11:38,468 --> 01:11:41,301
and all of a sudden, fall flat on his puss.

977
01:11:45,275 --> 01:11:47,266
A glass of sherry, perhaps?

978
01:11:47,344 --> 01:11:50,438
Will you get Miss Warriner
a glass of sherry?

979
01:11:51,481 --> 01:11:54,211
A glass of sherry? Excuse me.

980
01:11:54,484 --> 01:11:56,111
l don't like sherry.

981
01:11:59,022 --> 01:12:02,048
-Would you make that ginger ale please?
-Ginger ale?

982
01:12:06,630 --> 01:12:11,294
l'm sorry to interrupt you again, Jerry.
Now, what were you saying?

983
01:12:11,368 --> 01:12:15,304
l was just telling one of Father's stories.
You've heard it.

984
01:12:15,439 --> 01:12:17,498
With a minute to go, Dad had the ball--

985
01:12:17,608 --> 01:12:20,168
-A ball? What ball?
-The football.

986
01:12:20,277 --> 01:12:23,713
What in the world was Dad ever doing
with a football?

987
01:12:24,615 --> 01:12:29,143
l was just telling a story about when Father
was at Princeton. You remember--

988
01:12:29,219 --> 01:12:32,120
Oh, yes, of course l remember.
Pop loved Princeton.

989
01:12:32,189 --> 01:12:34,214
He was there nearly 20 years.

990
01:12:34,825 --> 01:12:38,124
lf ever a man loved a place, he did.
He just adored it.

991
01:12:38,295 --> 01:12:41,321
And he certainly kept it looking beautiful.

992
01:12:42,165 --> 01:12:44,133
You've seen the grounds, of course.

993
01:12:44,201 --> 01:12:45,463
Of course?

994
01:12:46,937 --> 01:12:48,461
-Thank you.
-l'm afraid l'm--

995
01:12:49,172 --> 01:12:50,469
So sorry!

996
01:12:50,540 --> 01:12:52,531
-Here's your handkerchief.
-Thank you.

997
01:12:52,643 --> 01:12:56,340
l'm afraid that my sister
has a somewhat distorted sense of humor.

998
01:12:56,446 --> 01:12:57,378
So have l.

999
01:12:57,481 --> 01:13:00,143
What she meant was,
Father presented the college...

1000
01:13:00,217 --> 01:13:02,583
with some of its finest landscapings.

1001
01:13:03,954 --> 01:13:08,448
Excuse me. Was l thirsty!
lt must have been that ham l had for dinner.

1002
01:13:12,296 --> 01:13:15,629
-l think my brother's pretty swell, don't you?
-Oh, yes.

1003
01:13:15,866 --> 01:13:18,027
He's always been pretty swell to me.

1004
01:13:18,135 --> 01:13:20,695
l was working my head off
at the Virginia Club.

1005
01:13:20,804 --> 01:13:24,706
But the minute he started doing better,
you know what l mean...

1006
01:13:24,808 --> 01:13:29,575
why, he made me give up my job
and take a trip to London and Paris...

1007
01:13:29,646 --> 01:13:32,479
and.... l think that was pretty swell,
don't you?

1008
01:13:32,582 --> 01:13:34,482
What did you do at the Virginia Club?

1009
01:13:34,584 --> 01:13:36,575
-You see--
-l'll tell her!

1010
01:13:37,087 --> 01:13:40,250
lt was a little act, kind of....

1011
01:13:40,657 --> 01:13:42,648
Well, it's a little hard to explain.

1012
01:13:42,759 --> 01:13:45,319
-Have you got any records?
-Records?

1013
01:13:45,495 --> 01:13:48,987
-Yes. We have some records.
-Well, maybe if we....

1014
01:13:49,766 --> 01:13:51,529
Say, wait a minute!

1015
01:13:55,439 --> 01:13:57,964
Don't anybody leave this room.
l've lost my purse.

1016
01:13:58,075 --> 01:14:02,136
-Why, here it is.
-Well, am l relieved.

1017
01:14:03,013 --> 01:14:04,640
Where are the records?

1018
01:14:04,748 --> 01:14:07,148
Come this way and l'll show you.

1019
01:14:08,185 --> 01:14:11,086
Look, will you keep an eye on that for me?

1020
01:14:15,625 --> 01:14:18,822
Here's my song.
Would you like to have me do it for you?

1021
01:14:18,929 --> 01:14:20,954
-Well, no, l don't--
-Okay.

1022
01:14:21,832 --> 01:14:25,996
You'll have to put that on.
lt's a little fancy for me.

1023
01:14:26,136 --> 01:14:28,900
The one we've got at home, you just wind.

1024
01:14:28,972 --> 01:14:30,462
l wouldn't, if l were you.

1025
01:14:30,574 --> 01:14:32,940
l won't do it the way l did at the club...

1026
01:14:33,010 --> 01:14:35,444
if that's what you're afraid of.

1027
01:14:35,512 --> 01:14:37,309
You think l'm a fool?

1028
01:14:38,415 --> 01:14:40,246
The number has some wind effects...

1029
01:14:40,317 --> 01:14:44,253
but you'll just have to use
your own imagination about them.

1030
01:14:56,566 --> 01:14:57,260
Get it?

1031
01:15:30,167 --> 01:15:31,498
l never could do that.

1032
01:15:38,442 --> 01:15:40,433
Are we going so soon?

1033
01:15:40,544 --> 01:15:42,603
l was just beginning to enjoy myself.

1034
01:15:42,712 --> 01:15:45,078
Good night. Good night, all.

1035
01:15:50,654 --> 01:15:53,487
-Where are you going?
-l'm going to Patsy's cabin.

1036
01:15:53,590 --> 01:15:58,050
-You're not in any condition to drive.
-l can make it in two minutes on two wheels.

1037
01:15:58,128 --> 01:15:59,425
That's what you think.

1038
01:15:59,496 --> 01:16:02,465
-Get over.
-This is my car. l want to drive my car.

1039
01:16:02,566 --> 01:16:03,624
-Over.
-No.

1040
01:16:03,733 --> 01:16:06,395
-l wish you'd stayed in there.
-That's right.

1041
01:16:07,304 --> 01:16:10,865
Would you mind shutting that off,
or at least turning it down?

1042
01:16:13,944 --> 01:16:15,206
Give it to me.

1043
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:19,713
That's right, put it where we can find it.

1044
01:16:22,586 --> 01:16:24,417
-Here, you can't do that.
-What?

1045
01:16:24,488 --> 01:16:26,422
-Shut that thing off.
-What?

1046
01:16:27,724 --> 01:16:30,557
lt's against the law.
Besides, you'll wake everyone up.

1047
01:16:30,627 --> 01:16:31,753
What?

1048
01:16:31,862 --> 01:16:35,127
He says we'll wake up....

1049
01:16:36,433 --> 01:16:38,367
Why don't you help me?

1050
01:17:02,626 --> 01:17:05,925
-lt's beautiful up here, don't you think so?
-Sure, it's swell.

1051
01:17:05,996 --> 01:17:08,328
lf it wasn't for you, l'd have missed all this.

1052
01:17:08,431 --> 01:17:09,398
That's right.

1053
01:17:09,466 --> 01:17:11,457
l suppose by the time l get to town...

1054
01:17:11,568 --> 01:17:14,059
it will hardly be worthwhile going to bed.

1055
01:17:14,137 --> 01:17:16,162
You mind if l use your car to go home?

1056
01:17:16,273 --> 01:17:18,798
No, l don't mind,
only l think it's awfully silly.

1057
01:17:18,909 --> 01:17:20,638
Patsy will be disappointed.

1058
01:17:20,744 --> 01:17:22,769
Well, thanks. l'll go home.

1059
01:17:22,879 --> 01:17:25,905
lt's all right with me.
My goodness, l just thought....

1060
01:17:25,982 --> 01:17:28,473
Yes, you just thought
that if l'd stay up there...

1061
01:17:28,585 --> 01:17:32,919
you'd show me exactly how innocent
a night in the country can be, didn't you?

1062
01:17:34,491 --> 01:17:37,483
Are you still harping
on that same old string?

1063
01:17:37,594 --> 01:17:40,392
lt doesn't matter to me
whether you go or stay.

1064
01:17:40,463 --> 01:17:43,660
l was just trying
to make it easier for you, that's all.

1065
01:17:53,410 --> 01:17:55,401
Did you have to throw that gadget away?

1066
01:17:55,478 --> 01:17:57,946
You want me to go back and look for it?

1067
01:17:58,381 --> 01:18:00,440
What else can happen to us?

1068
01:18:01,451 --> 01:18:02,383
A lot.

1069
01:18:05,322 --> 01:18:07,313
-What's that?
-Two motorcycles.

1070
01:18:07,757 --> 01:18:10,248
-Anybody riding them?
-There are two men.

1071
01:18:10,427 --> 01:18:12,554
-Are they in uniform?
-Yes.

1072
01:18:14,898 --> 01:18:16,058
Fine.

1073
01:18:29,145 --> 01:18:31,113
-Turn down that radio.
-l can't.

1074
01:18:31,214 --> 01:18:33,375
What do you mean you can't?

1075
01:18:33,450 --> 01:18:36,146
You lost the control?
You can't let it run that way!

1076
01:18:36,253 --> 01:18:39,950
-Let me take a look at it.
-Wait a minute, l'll get out of your way.

1077
01:18:40,056 --> 01:18:41,580
See what you can do.

1078
01:18:42,626 --> 01:18:45,754
-Help me to sort the wiring.
-Let's take a look at it.

1079
01:18:51,735 --> 01:18:53,032
Don't!

1080
01:18:56,373 --> 01:18:57,772
lt's always good.

1081
01:18:58,541 --> 01:19:01,101
Do you know you can get a ticket for that?

1082
01:19:01,244 --> 01:19:02,711
-ls this your car?
-Nope!

1083
01:19:02,779 --> 01:19:05,304
-Whose car is it?
-l'll give you one more guess.

1084
01:19:05,415 --> 01:19:07,610
So it's yours. Where's your ownership card?

1085
01:19:07,717 --> 01:19:11,244
-ln my bureau's upper right-hand drawer.
-Are you sure this is your car?

1086
01:19:11,354 --> 01:19:12,912
Of course l'm sure!

1087
01:19:13,023 --> 01:19:16,584
lf it's your car, what's the license number?
What is it?

1088
01:19:16,693 --> 01:19:19,127
l don't know. They change it every year.

1089
01:19:19,229 --> 01:19:22,596
Don't look now,
but what's the number on your motorcycle?

1090
01:19:24,234 --> 01:19:27,761
-Have you folks been drinking?
-No, l haven't, but....

1091
01:19:28,271 --> 01:19:31,035
-Let me see you walk this line.
-Come on.

1092
01:19:32,909 --> 01:19:34,877
Go on, honey, truck it!

1093
01:19:52,195 --> 01:19:55,187
-Now what have you done?
-The brakes are bad.

1094
01:19:55,298 --> 01:19:59,064
lt's a bad break for us, too.
Now we haven't any transportation.

1095
01:19:59,169 --> 01:20:03,196
Could you two gentlemen take us
to my aunt's cabin? lt's only 15 miles.

1096
01:20:03,273 --> 01:20:06,674
-That is, if you've nothing else to do.
-No, l don't.

1097
01:20:06,743 --> 01:20:08,005
-Have you?
-Oh, no.

1098
01:20:08,078 --> 01:20:09,602
Oh, that's fine.

1099
01:20:11,114 --> 01:20:12,411
Where will you sit?

1100
01:20:12,515 --> 01:20:15,279
l'll have to figure that one out, l guess.

1101
01:20:57,494 --> 01:20:59,689
Come on, try it. lt's fun!

1102
01:21:21,418 --> 01:21:24,410
Now, listen, you two.
Don't say a word to this guy.

1103
01:21:25,555 --> 01:21:27,216
Who are these people?

1104
01:21:27,323 --> 01:21:29,883
Why, that's Mrs. Warriner
and that's Mr. Warriner.

1105
01:21:29,993 --> 01:21:31,756
How do you do?

1106
01:21:33,329 --> 01:21:34,387
Hello.

1107
01:21:34,497 --> 01:21:38,524
l guess that settles it.
Will you get my car out in the morning?

1108
01:21:38,601 --> 01:21:42,833
ln the meantime, think of something
you'd like for Christmas. Goodbye.

1109
01:21:43,473 --> 01:21:46,465
-l hope you have a nice trip back.
-Thank you.

1110
01:21:46,543 --> 01:21:47,567
Hi, Dad.

1111
01:21:48,311 --> 01:21:49,369
Hello, Dad.

1112
01:21:49,479 --> 01:21:51,071
Everything all right with you?

1113
01:21:51,181 --> 01:21:53,741
-Oh, l'm feeling fine.
-That's good.

1114
01:21:54,851 --> 01:21:57,217
But l wasn't expecting nobody tonight.

1115
01:21:57,320 --> 01:21:58,810
lsn't Aunt Patsy here?

1116
01:21:58,888 --> 01:22:01,049
-Well, no.
-She isn't here?

1117
01:22:01,724 --> 01:22:04,215
-But l thought for sure she was here.
-l didn't.

1118
01:22:04,394 --> 01:22:06,021
lsn't that funny?

1119
01:22:06,095 --> 01:22:07,858
Let me get you some coffee.

1120
01:22:07,931 --> 01:22:10,331
Oh, no, l don't think so, Dad.

1121
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:14,166
lt might keep me awake.
l'm going right to bed. l'm awfully tired.

1122
01:22:16,873 --> 01:22:18,340
See? She's all in.

1123
01:22:18,408 --> 01:22:21,070
-Oh, Dad, is this room in order?
-Yes.

1124
01:22:21,177 --> 01:22:23,543
That's fine. Mr. Warriner will sleep in there.

1125
01:22:23,646 --> 01:22:27,207
Give him a couple of nice warm blankets.
He has a bad cold.

1126
01:22:27,317 --> 01:22:28,375
ls that right?

1127
01:22:28,485 --> 01:22:31,249
l've had a bad cold now
for some considerable time.

1128
01:22:31,354 --> 01:22:33,845
-That's too bad.
-About three months.

1129
01:22:35,825 --> 01:22:36,292
How are you doing in there?

1130
01:22:36,292 --> 01:22:37,316
How are you doing in there?

1131
01:22:37,393 --> 01:22:39,691
l'm having a little wardrobe trouble.

1132
01:22:39,796 --> 01:22:41,127
You should see me.

1133
01:22:41,197 --> 01:22:44,030
l'm glad you told him l have a cold.
He fixed me up good.

1134
01:22:44,133 --> 01:22:47,660
My nightie is coming to me
through the courtesy of Aunt Patsy.

1135
01:22:53,977 --> 01:22:55,638
Go, get off!

1136
01:23:24,674 --> 01:23:26,141
Air-conditioned.

1137
01:23:28,945 --> 01:23:31,470
-What's wrong with this?
-l don't know.

1138
01:23:35,518 --> 01:23:37,952
The lock isn't very practical, is it?

1139
01:23:39,689 --> 01:23:41,623
No, it's not so very practical....

1140
01:23:42,225 --> 01:23:44,455
l guess it will serve its purpose.

1141
01:23:48,565 --> 01:23:50,999
Well, good night.

1142
01:23:52,702 --> 01:23:53,999
Good night.

1143
01:24:17,961 --> 01:24:20,828
l'm afraid we're going to have trouble
with this.

1144
01:24:20,897 --> 01:24:23,024
l guess l'll be all right.

1145
01:24:27,370 --> 01:24:29,395
-Good night.
-Good night.

1146
01:24:31,841 --> 01:24:33,035
Good night.

1147
01:25:37,173 --> 01:25:39,198
l told you we'd have trouble with this.

1148
01:25:39,308 --> 01:25:40,536
Yes.

1149
01:25:48,251 --> 01:25:51,311
ln a half an hour,
we'll no longer be Mr. and Mrs.

1150
01:25:52,755 --> 01:25:54,154
Funny, isn't it?

1151
01:25:54,657 --> 01:25:58,889
Yes, it's funny that everything
is the way it is, on account of how you feel.

1152
01:25:59,896 --> 01:26:04,458
l mean, if you didn't feel how you do,
things wouldn't be as they are, would they?

1153
01:26:05,501 --> 01:26:09,164
l mean, things could be the same
if things were different.

1154
01:26:11,140 --> 01:26:13,870
-But things are the way you made them.
-Oh, no.

1155
01:26:13,976 --> 01:26:17,844
Things are the way you think l made them.
l didn't make them that way at all.

1156
01:26:17,914 --> 01:26:20,678
Things are just the same
as they always were...

1157
01:26:20,883 --> 01:26:23,408
only you're the same as you were, too...

1158
01:26:23,720 --> 01:26:26,985
so l guess things
will never be the same again.

1159
01:26:34,897 --> 01:26:36,330
Good night.

1160
01:26:46,375 --> 01:26:48,570
-Got caught in the door.
-Good night.

1161
01:26:48,911 --> 01:26:50,071
Good night.

1162
01:28:21,504 --> 01:28:23,131
Why, you....

1163
01:28:30,379 --> 01:28:32,438
l was trying to stop it.

1164
01:28:33,616 --> 01:28:35,379
Well, there it goes again.

1165
01:28:52,635 --> 01:28:54,865
You're all confused, aren't you?

1166
01:28:56,606 --> 01:28:58,267
-Aren't you?
-No.

1167
01:28:58,507 --> 01:29:01,271
You should be. You're wrong
about things being different...

1168
01:29:01,344 --> 01:29:03,437
because they're not the same.

1169
01:29:03,512 --> 01:29:06,447
Things are different,
except in a different way.

1170
01:29:06,515 --> 01:29:09,245
You're still the same, only l've been a fool.

1171
01:29:09,619 --> 01:29:10,984
But l'm not now.

1172
01:29:11,754 --> 01:29:14,086
As long as l'm different, don't you think...

1173
01:29:14,156 --> 01:29:16,283
maybe things could be the same again...

1174
01:29:16,359 --> 01:29:18,088
only a little different?

1175
01:29:18,527 --> 01:29:20,119
You mean that, Jerry?

1176
01:29:20,997 --> 01:29:22,362
Are you sure?

1177
01:29:22,698 --> 01:29:26,099
No more doubts? No more being....

1178
01:29:28,938 --> 01:29:30,963
-Except....
-Except what?

1179
01:29:31,507 --> 01:29:34,499
-There's only one thing that bothers me.
-What?

1180
01:29:37,013 --> 01:29:38,605
This darn lock.

1181
01:29:41,517 --> 01:29:42,745
ls that all?

1182
01:29:49,258 --> 01:29:51,522
You think maybe if you....

1183
01:30:11,747 --> 01:30:13,146
Good night.
