1
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:03,498
Goodbye, sweetheart!

2
00:02:03,582 --> 00:02:05,667
T ake good care of yourself.

3
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:07,211
Oh, Mummy, you forgot this.

4
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:09,087
Angel!

5
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,509
I worry so
about you living alone.

6
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:17,012
Oh, Mother, it's adorable
of you to be so concerned,

7
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:21,058
but I'm perfectly capable
of taking care of myself, dear.

8
00:02:24,353 --> 00:02:26,104
Come on, girls.

9
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,398
Goodbye, my chicken.

10
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:38,659
Yes, I'm free!

11
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:40,202
I can live in New York
on my own.

12
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:42,120
I can do whatever I want!

13
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,288
Yay!

14
00:02:43,372 --> 00:02:44,748
Yes!

15
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,834
<i>I was born and nurtured
in New York,</i>

16
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:48,418
<i>the center of the universe.</i>

17
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:51,755
<i>Unfortunately, my mother is
moving me to another planet.</i>

18
00:02:51,797 --> 00:02:53,173
<i>New Jersey.</i>

19
00:02:53,257 --> 00:02:55,634
<i>Is it any wonder
that I couldn't face reality?</i>

20
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:57,427
<i>Can anyone blame me
for dreaming</i>

21
00:02:57,469 --> 00:03:00,430
<i>that she was leaving me behind
in my beloved city?</i>

22
00:03:00,472 --> 00:03:01,723
Mary!

23
00:03:01,807 --> 00:03:03,767
Mary, let's go!

24
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:05,853
Goodbye, childhood home.

25
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:09,731
Goodbye, intellectual
and spiritual stimulation.

26
00:03:09,815 --> 00:03:11,024
Goodbye, Broadway.

27
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:12,109
Mary, please.

28
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,319
Don't be such a drama queen.

29
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:15,112
Lola!

30
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:17,489
My name from
this day forward is Lola.

31
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:20,784
I've known since I was 5 years
old that my true name is Lola.

32
00:03:20,826 --> 00:03:21,952
You were named Mary.

33
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:24,121
It is the name
on your birth certificate.

34
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:28,041
It is the name
that I am going to call you.

35
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:32,004
<i>In my family, I am a flamingo
in a flock of pigeons.</i>

36
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:47,644
<i>Goodbye, New York.</i>

37
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:50,647
<i>Goodbye, any chance of becoming
a famous actress.</i>

38
00:04:10,334 --> 00:04:12,294
<i>Your parents tell you
to have hopes and dreams.</i>

39
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:14,421
<i>And then they move you
to New Jersey.</i>

40
00:04:14,505 --> 00:04:16,173
<i>It makes no sense.</i>

41
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:19,468
Welcome to Deadwood.

42
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:22,221
Is she allowed to say that?

43
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:39,363
Come on.

44
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:40,614
Hurry, hurry.

45
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:42,699
Let's see the new house.

46
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:44,076
Come on.

47
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:49,540
Oh, Mom.

48
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:50,916
It's just grass.

49
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:53,377
But it's all over the place.

50
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:58,257
<i>The sun porch is my bedroom.</i>

51
00:04:58,340 --> 00:04:59,883
<i>Ordinariness
isn't the only thing</i>

52
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:01,426
<i>I have to fight against
in my house.</i>

53
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,929
<i>Gross injustice is another.</i>

54
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:06,431
<i>The only person I can turn to
is Stu Wolff,</i>

55
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:08,058
<i>the greatest poet
since Shakespeare</i>

56
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,519
<i>and the lead singer
of Sidarthur.</i>

57
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:13,730
<i>He'd see me through
my dark suburban days.</i>

58
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,235
<i>In the city, I took two subways
and a bus to get to school.</i>

59
00:05:18,277 --> 00:05:20,237
<i>It amazes me
that I can get to school</i>

60
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:22,406
<i>without it costing $1.50.</i>

61
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:33,625
<i>Dellwood High.</i>

62
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:37,129
<i>I shall be a bird in a cage
with a good school district.</i>

63
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:39,923
<i>However, there is absolutely
no point in being negative</i>

64
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:42,092
<i>about things
you just can't change.</i>

65
00:05:42,134 --> 00:05:44,428
<i>I look upon my new town
as an empty stage</i>

66
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:46,805
<i>to which I'm allowed to bring
my own script.</i>

67
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:49,641
<i>In my heart, I feel that
a legend is about to be born.</i>

68
00:05:49,725 --> 00:05:51,435
<i>That legend would be me.</i>

69
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:12,456
Hello.

70
00:06:12,498 --> 00:06:13,832
Hey.

71
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,668
I'm Lola Steppe.

72
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,962
I'm from New York, originally.

73
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:20,047
Ella Gerard.

74
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:22,966
I'm from right here, originally.

75
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:25,552
Well, hi.

76
00:06:26,512 --> 00:06:27,638
Hi.

77
00:06:30,641 --> 00:06:32,142
Hi!

78
00:06:33,352 --> 00:06:34,770
Hi.

79
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:38,190
Have you ever seen
Sidarthur in person?

80
00:06:38,232 --> 00:06:39,983
No, but I think Stu Wolff

81
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:42,277
is the greatest poet
since Shakespeare.

82
00:06:42,361 --> 00:06:43,487
I do, too.

83
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,489
I have every CD they ever made.

84
00:06:45,531 --> 00:06:47,074
-You do?
-Yeah!

85
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:48,700
And that's Stu Wolff dancing.

86
00:06:48,784 --> 00:06:50,911
I've downloaded
some great shots of him.

87
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:52,454
Here he is at the Grammys.

88
00:06:52,538 --> 00:06:54,915
This is where he lives.

89
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:58,460
This is the dress that I'm gonna
wear when we get married.

90
00:06:58,544 --> 00:07:00,087
This is him getting
into his limo.

91
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:02,172
That black spot right there
is his head.

92
00:07:02,214 --> 00:07:03,882
What a wonderful
black spot it is.

93
00:07:03,966 --> 00:07:04,967
Hi.

94
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,385
Carla Santini.

95
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,095
Sidarthur.

96
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:10,055
My father is Stu Wolff's lawyer.

97
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:11,056
Really?

98
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:14,393
Your dad must have been in the
same room as him and everything.

99
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,186
Many times.

100
00:07:16,228 --> 00:07:18,814
Aren't you the girl who just
moved into the Swenska house?

101
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:19,898
Well, I'm Lola Steppe.

102
00:07:19,982 --> 00:07:21,733
I didn't know our home
had a name.

103
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:25,445
Is that supposed to be that
famous New York sense of humor?

104
00:07:26,572 --> 00:07:28,490
New Yorkers learn
to laugh at themselves

105
00:07:28,574 --> 00:07:31,785
and everything else
when they're very young.

106
00:07:31,869 --> 00:07:35,038
My parents took me to New York
for my birthday.

107
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,833
I thought it was beautiful.
The lights and everything.

108
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:40,544
I know why they call it
the greatest city in the world.

109
00:07:40,586 --> 00:07:42,796
Ella Gerard, you are
the sister of my soul!

110
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,590
You should see Park Avenue
at Christmas.

111
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:46,425
It's like walking
through the Milky Way.

112
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:49,136
Except nobody gets mugged
in the Milky Way.

113
00:07:51,555 --> 00:07:53,932
We'll take our seats now.

114
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:56,977
Miss Baggoli?

115
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:57,728
Yes?

116
00:07:57,769 --> 00:08:00,689
We have a new girl
from New York City.

117
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:02,482
We do.

118
00:08:02,566 --> 00:08:03,942
Miss Steppe.

119
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:05,944
Miss Steppe.

120
00:08:06,028 --> 00:08:08,280
Miss Baggoli, I know it must
show on your records

121
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:09,281
that my name is Mary,

122
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:11,074
but everyone has referred
to me as Lola

123
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:13,452
since I was a squealing infant
in my mother's arms.

124
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:16,163
I don't even know
who this Mary is.

125
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:19,082
I like that name.

126
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:20,250
Lola.

127
00:08:20,292 --> 00:08:21,460
Lola.

128
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:23,003
This is Lola.

129
00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:24,630
Lola, you should know

130
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:27,382
that you're sitting in my
favorite seat in history class.

131
00:08:27,466 --> 00:08:28,675
I like to be dead center.

132
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:32,221
Me too, and I didn't think
we had anything in common.

133
00:08:32,304 --> 00:08:33,639
I've earned the center seat.

134
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:35,140
Besides, if you want to fit in,

135
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:37,351
you probably shouldn't
draw attention to yourself.

136
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:40,020
In case you haven't noticed,
I like the attention.

137
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:41,939
Chill.

138
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,360
Also, I wouldn't hang out
with Ella "Never Had a Fella."

139
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:49,029
She doesn't really have your
potential, now, does she?

140
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:49,821
Look at her.

141
00:08:49,905 --> 00:08:51,573
She dresses like
a politician's wife

142
00:08:51,657 --> 00:08:53,200
with the hair and the shoes.

143
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:54,284
She's so random.

144
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:56,912
And what about those glasses?
They are so 10 minutes ago.

145
00:08:56,995 --> 00:08:59,331
But I'm gonna stop myself
before I get nasty.

146
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:01,500
I want to let you know
that if you're careful,

147
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,335
you could be chilling with us.

148
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:06,171
Chilling with you is what
I've always dreamed of.

149
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:11,385
Hey, Ella, wait up!
Do you mind if I sit with you?

150
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:13,011
Oh, no, that's fine.

151
00:09:13,095 --> 00:09:13,846
This is great.

152
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:17,015
When you eat outside in
New York, your food gets dirty.

153
00:09:17,975 --> 00:09:20,394
So what's with
the Great Santini?

154
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:22,062
She's beautiful.
She's popular.

155
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:23,313
She's rich.

156
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:25,732
In kindergarten, she used to
bite the heads off dolls.

157
00:09:25,816 --> 00:09:27,192
Ew.

158
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:31,864
Who's that guy smiling at us?

159
00:09:32,364 --> 00:09:33,574
That's Sam.

160
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:35,909
Sam!

161
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:39,705
Sam, Lola.

162
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:41,790
Lola, Sam.

163
00:09:41,874 --> 00:09:42,833
Hi.

164
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:44,459
Hey.

165
00:09:44,543 --> 00:09:46,503
It's your first day here, right?

166
00:09:46,587 --> 00:09:48,172
Yeah.

167
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:49,464
Well, it's good to meet you.

168
00:09:49,548 --> 00:09:51,383
You too.

169
00:09:51,425 --> 00:09:52,593
I'll see you later.

170
00:09:56,722 --> 00:09:58,807
<i>I couldn't possibly have
a boyfriend.</i>

171
00:09:58,891 --> 00:10:01,602
<i>I mean, I have to focus
on my acting career.</i>

172
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:05,355
<i>After three weeks,</i>

173
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,399
<i>I'm getting used to
the rich part of town.</i>

174
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:10,485
<i>Gated, dull, Armani-ridden.</i>

175
00:10:10,569 --> 00:10:13,363
<i>You know, I'm the kind of
riffraff they try to keep out.</i>

176
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,145
When Stu Wolff sings,

177
00:10:45,229 --> 00:10:48,857
"There's something in me
that always wants more.

178
00:10:48,941 --> 00:10:52,402
More moons and stars
and music in the wind,"

179
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:54,780
it's as though
he's just talking to me.

180
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:56,740
I like Steve.

181
00:10:57,741 --> 00:11:00,077
I bet Stu is hard
to get along with.

182
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:01,954
You can tell he's sort of moody.

183
00:11:02,037 --> 00:11:03,372
Haunted.

184
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:05,415
All true geniuses are haunted.

185
00:11:05,499 --> 00:11:07,793
It's part of what they have to
suffer for their art.

186
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:10,128
Popovers, ladies.

187
00:11:10,963 --> 00:11:11,713
Wow.

188
00:11:11,797 --> 00:11:14,258
This is just like eating
in a diner. Thank you.

189
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:16,468
Well, surely you have
popovers at home.

190
00:11:16,552 --> 00:11:19,012
I just popped them
in the microwave.

191
00:11:19,096 --> 00:11:21,265
My mother doesn't approve
of microwaves.

192
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:23,475
She has very strong opinions.

193
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:25,394
I've never heard
of anyone taking a stance

194
00:11:25,477 --> 00:11:27,604
on an appliance before.

195
00:11:32,484 --> 00:11:34,319
Why doesn't your mother like me?

196
00:11:34,403 --> 00:11:35,320
She likes you.

197
00:11:35,404 --> 00:11:37,489
She just thinks you're
a little strange.

198
00:11:37,573 --> 00:11:40,909
I mean, you are, a little.

199
00:11:42,828 --> 00:11:43,829
Lola!

200
00:11:43,871 --> 00:11:46,165
Lola, I'm sorry!

201
00:11:46,498 --> 00:11:48,959
It's really your mother
she thinks is strange.

202
00:11:49,001 --> 00:11:51,336
My mom saw your mother
in the supermarket

203
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,589
wearing dirty overalls
with chopsticks in her hair

204
00:11:53,672 --> 00:11:56,008
and arguing with the butcher.

205
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:57,843
It's not important.

206
00:11:57,885 --> 00:11:58,969
Not important?

207
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:01,805
She's the woman
who gave me life.

208
00:12:01,847 --> 00:12:04,308
Whose milk fed my fragile body.

209
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:06,643
Whose blood flows
through my veins.

210
00:12:06,685 --> 00:12:09,104
Of course it's important.

211
00:12:09,188 --> 00:12:11,481
My parents are square.

212
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:13,400
Neither of them is too happy
about the fact

213
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:17,654
that your mother has three
children and no husband.

214
00:12:17,696 --> 00:12:20,532
Single motherhood
is a transitory state.

215
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:22,326
Karen used to be married.

216
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:23,827
It could happen again.

217
00:12:23,869 --> 00:12:27,539
But I thought you said
you were a love child.

218
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:30,834
Well, I was a love child.

219
00:12:30,876 --> 00:12:34,713
Mom and Dad were married
and passionately in love.

220
00:12:38,884 --> 00:12:42,346
My parents were mad for each
other as soon as their eyes met.

221
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:44,014
Dad was like a rock star.

222
00:12:44,056 --> 00:12:45,682
Mom was a babe.

223
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:49,019
The rest was destiny.

224
00:12:50,938 --> 00:12:52,689
They got married.

225
00:12:53,232 --> 00:12:56,527
And then they camped in the
desert and counted the stars.

226
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:58,320
One million and three.

227
00:12:58,403 --> 00:12:59,530
One million and four.

228
00:12:59,613 --> 00:13:02,032
Jeez. My parents went
on a cruise to Bermuda,

229
00:13:02,074 --> 00:13:04,618
but they were afraid
to get off the boat.

230
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,912
Mine were in love.

231
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:08,956
Deeply, movingly.

232
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:11,291
The only thing that could have
made their lives better

233
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:13,085
was having me.

234
00:13:15,337 --> 00:13:16,338
Even as an infant

235
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:20,217
I aspired to have a relationship
just like theirs.

236
00:13:20,259 --> 00:13:21,802
And then the twins
were conceived,

237
00:13:21,885 --> 00:13:24,304
and we couldn't have been
more thrilled.

238
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,473
Upon hearing the news,

239
00:13:26,557 --> 00:13:28,642
my father mounted
his really cool motorcycle

240
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:30,727
to buy the mother of his child
and future children

241
00:13:30,811 --> 00:13:32,980
her favorite flowers.

242
00:13:37,109 --> 00:13:38,485
Suddenly...

243
00:13:38,569 --> 00:13:39,736
Aah!

244
00:13:45,951 --> 00:13:49,329
They found him strewn
across 9th Avenue.

245
00:13:49,663 --> 00:13:51,665
And 10th.

246
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:57,921
Lola, I'm so sorry.

247
00:13:58,005 --> 00:13:59,798
I had no idea.

248
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,592
Ironic, isn't it?

249
00:14:02,926 --> 00:14:04,303
Your parents think my mother

250
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:06,930
is the destroyer
of our social order.

251
00:14:07,014 --> 00:14:09,558
She's merely a victim of fate.

252
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:26,742
What?

253
00:14:26,825 --> 00:14:27,618
Nothing.

254
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:30,245
I like the chopsticks
in your hair.

255
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:49,515
<i>Because Carla Santini
thinks she's Julia Roberts</i>

256
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:51,975
<i>and the universe is interested
in everything she says,</i>

257
00:14:52,017 --> 00:14:53,352
<i>you can't help overhearing her.</i>

258
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:56,522
So I had this really long talk
with Miss Baggoli yesterday

259
00:14:56,605 --> 00:14:58,815
about the drama club's
production of "Pygmalion."

260
00:14:58,857 --> 00:15:01,693
I told her I think it's really
rigid to stick to the original.

261
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:03,529
Not stick to the original?

262
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:06,657
Not stick to the exquisite words
of Mr. George Bernard Shaw?

263
00:15:06,698 --> 00:15:09,159
We're not English,
and this isn't the 19th century,

264
00:15:09,201 --> 00:15:12,412
so I think we should adapt the
classics to reflect our times.

265
00:15:12,496 --> 00:15:15,123
They're classics
because they're classic.

266
00:15:15,207 --> 00:15:16,416
Then I told her about my idea

267
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,335
to move the location
to present-day New York

268
00:15:18,377 --> 00:15:19,962
and make Eliza a checkout girl.

269
00:15:20,045 --> 00:15:21,463
You're gonna be playing Eliza?

270
00:15:21,547 --> 00:15:22,464
Well, of course.

271
00:15:22,548 --> 00:15:23,924
I've already got the part.

272
00:15:24,466 --> 00:15:25,717
<i>When I moved to Deadwood,</i>

273
00:15:25,801 --> 00:15:28,178
<i>I really felt that a legend
was about to be born.</i>

274
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:31,682
<i>Was Carla Santini going to
stand in the way of that birth?</i>

275
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,523
Miss Baggoli, Miss Baggoli!

276
00:15:39,565 --> 00:15:41,942
I didn't know "Pygmalion"
had already been cast.

277
00:15:42,025 --> 00:15:44,361
I would have loved to be
Eliza Doolittle.

278
00:15:44,403 --> 00:15:46,405
Maybe if I could
just prove it to you now.

279
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:47,531
Oh, no, no, Lola.

280
00:15:47,573 --> 00:15:49,616
I just put the notice up
on the board.

281
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:52,703
Auditions are not until Friday.

282
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:55,998
Thank you, Miss Baggoli.

283
00:15:57,708 --> 00:16:03,922
George Bernard Shaw
is a great playwright.

284
00:16:04,298 --> 00:16:08,760
And he's also a vegetarian.

285
00:16:08,802 --> 00:16:10,554
You're just in time, Lola.

286
00:16:10,596 --> 00:16:11,430
Quickly.

287
00:16:11,513 --> 00:16:17,644
I'm telling all the others
about this idea that I have had

288
00:16:17,728 --> 00:16:20,898
for our production
of "Pygmalion."

289
00:16:20,939 --> 00:16:23,942
Now, as you know,
"Pygmalion" is a play

290
00:16:23,984 --> 00:16:28,071
which takes place
in old-timey London.

291
00:16:28,155 --> 00:16:33,785
My idea is that we will set
our production of "Pygmalion"

292
00:16:33,869 --> 00:16:36,163
in modern-day New York.

293
00:16:36,246 --> 00:16:41,001
And Eliza will be a checkout
girl at a supermarket,

294
00:16:41,084 --> 00:16:46,423
And Professor Higgins will be
a professor at NYU.

295
00:16:46,465 --> 00:16:47,966
That is such a brilliant idea.

296
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:50,010
That's gonna give
the play new resonance

297
00:16:50,093 --> 00:16:52,429
and immediacy for today.

298
00:16:52,471 --> 00:16:54,389
You mean it was your idea?

299
00:16:54,473 --> 00:16:57,518
Yes, Lola, it's my idea.

300
00:16:57,601 --> 00:17:01,730
I know I'm just a teacher,
but I am capable of thought.

301
00:17:02,648 --> 00:17:06,610
Now, since we're going hip
and modern,

302
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:11,573
I have also added
contemporary songs.

303
00:17:11,657 --> 00:17:17,621
And I am calling it
"Eliza Rocks"!

304
00:17:18,664 --> 00:17:24,253
Now, each of you will be singing
a song for me of your choice,

305
00:17:24,336 --> 00:17:26,797
and then you'll be reading
a scene for me.

306
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,966
But I haven't rehearsed
a song or anything.

307
00:17:29,007 --> 00:17:30,300
I'm simply not prepared.

308
00:17:30,342 --> 00:17:31,301
That's fine.

309
00:17:31,343 --> 00:17:32,845
You can just wing it.

310
00:17:32,886 --> 00:17:34,680
But acting is my chosen career.

311
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:36,473
I mean,
I intend to be in theater.

312
00:17:36,515 --> 00:17:39,810
I don't want anyone remembering
a substandard audition.

313
00:17:39,852 --> 00:17:42,229
Then how are we to proceed?

314
00:17:43,188 --> 00:17:45,315
I guess I'll try, of course.

315
00:17:45,399 --> 00:17:46,942
Perhaps you could try now.

316
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:49,152
You could go first.

317
00:17:51,321 --> 00:17:52,573
Okay.

318
00:17:54,116 --> 00:17:55,868
Take a spot on the stage.

319
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:57,828
Anywhere you're comfortable.

320
00:18:01,832 --> 00:18:04,751
Maybe if we're lucky,
she'll fall.

321
00:18:06,336 --> 00:18:08,714
I'd like to sing a song
by my favorite band,

322
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:09,965
Sidarthur.

323
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:14,089
<i>Self-doubt didn't kick in
until the morning</i>

324
00:20:14,173 --> 00:20:17,134
<i>when I woke up with a heart as
cold and heavy as Mt. Everest.</i>

325
00:20:17,176 --> 00:20:19,636
<i>It was the day
the cast list went up.</i>

326
00:20:21,096 --> 00:20:23,515
<i>Why had I been so certain
I was going to get the lead?</i>

327
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:26,059
<i>Miss Baggoli didn't say
anything encouraging.</i>

328
00:20:26,143 --> 00:20:28,228
<i>Carla smiled.</i>

329
00:20:38,572 --> 00:20:40,782
Well, look what the wind
blew in.

330
00:20:40,866 --> 00:20:42,117
Look what the cat dragged in.

331
00:20:42,201 --> 00:20:43,660
Ladies.

332
00:20:44,203 --> 00:20:45,162
After you.

333
00:20:45,204 --> 00:20:47,623
Right.
After me.

334
00:21:28,247 --> 00:21:29,873
Unh!

335
00:21:30,707 --> 00:21:32,251
Ow.

336
00:21:46,014 --> 00:21:48,934
Well, once again,
I got the part that I wanted.

337
00:21:49,017 --> 00:21:50,018
-Oh!
-Oh!

338
00:21:52,187 --> 00:21:55,732
There are no small parts,
only small actors.

339
00:21:55,816 --> 00:21:57,776
You can quote me.

340
00:22:03,156 --> 00:22:05,117
I'm your new Eliza!

341
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:06,493
Aah!

342
00:22:06,952 --> 00:22:08,412
Amazing!

343
00:22:08,453 --> 00:22:10,080
I didn't think I'd get it,
but I did.

344
00:22:10,122 --> 00:22:12,332
I didn't think that,
because I knew you'd get it.

345
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:13,876
No, 'cause I was...

346
00:22:15,002 --> 00:22:17,296
Actually, my part,
the one of Mrs. Higgins,

347
00:22:17,337 --> 00:22:20,257
is much more interesting
than Eliza's in many ways.

348
00:22:20,299 --> 00:22:23,051
I mean, even though
she's not the female lead,

349
00:22:23,135 --> 00:22:26,763
it's a part with depth
and true contemporary resonance.

350
00:22:26,805 --> 00:22:28,223
It's the one that I wanted.

351
00:22:28,307 --> 00:22:31,143
Good, 'cause that's
the one you got.

352
00:22:33,604 --> 00:22:35,898
I'll show you what it's like
to be in my school.

353
00:22:35,981 --> 00:22:36,899
Is that a threat?

354
00:22:36,982 --> 00:22:38,150
Absolutely.

355
00:22:48,452 --> 00:22:49,703
To "Eliza Rocks"!

356
00:22:49,786 --> 00:22:51,955
To "Eliza Rocks"!

357
00:22:52,664 --> 00:22:53,916
Oh, man.

358
00:22:53,999 --> 00:22:55,876
-Congratulations.
-This is the best day.

359
00:22:55,959 --> 00:22:58,795
I can't imagine that
Carla got beat out!

360
00:23:03,425 --> 00:23:06,178
Hey, Sidarthur
fans, how about some big news?

361
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:07,387
You heard it here first.

362
00:23:07,471 --> 00:23:08,889
The band is breaking up.

363
00:23:08,972 --> 00:23:10,724
-What?
-Yep, Sidarthur is no more.

364
00:23:10,807 --> 00:23:12,476
I repeat, no more.

365
00:23:12,518 --> 00:23:14,019
Stu Wolff is moving on
and saying,

366
00:23:14,061 --> 00:23:16,104
"Never, never, will I work
with them again."

367
00:23:16,188 --> 00:23:17,856
So, in memory of the band,

368
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:21,109
Iet's hear a track
from "Always Morning."

369
00:23:25,572 --> 00:23:26,532
No!

370
00:23:26,573 --> 00:23:27,574
It can't be!

371
00:23:27,658 --> 00:23:29,701
It just can't be!

372
00:23:29,785 --> 00:23:30,702
Aah! Aah! Aah!

373
00:23:30,786 --> 00:23:32,538
What?
What's the matter?

374
00:23:32,579 --> 00:23:35,040
I can't breathe.
Mom, I can't breathe.

375
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:44,925
I heard.

376
00:23:45,008 --> 00:23:47,511
Thanks for being here
at a time like this.

377
00:23:54,101 --> 00:23:55,853
I don't want to believe it.

378
00:23:55,894 --> 00:24:00,148
I made these flyers to hand out
to fans urging them to protest.

379
00:24:01,441 --> 00:24:03,777
As these balloons
go to the heavens,

380
00:24:03,861 --> 00:24:05,988
so do the stars of our Sidarthur

381
00:24:06,071 --> 00:24:08,907
mix among the stars
of our universe.

382
00:24:12,161 --> 00:24:14,580
Symbolically, of course.

383
00:24:29,386 --> 00:24:30,345
Can you believe this?

384
00:24:30,429 --> 00:24:31,847
One of the most
catastrophic events

385
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:33,932
in the history of the universe
has occurred,

386
00:24:34,016 --> 00:24:36,935
and everyone's acting
as if nothing has happened.

387
00:24:38,604 --> 00:24:40,189
Great.

388
00:24:40,272 --> 00:24:42,608
Me again, of course.

389
00:24:42,649 --> 00:24:43,942
So, who's next?

390
00:24:43,984 --> 00:24:45,068
Me.

391
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:47,404
Are you crazy?
Carla's the all-time champion.

392
00:24:47,446 --> 00:24:50,073
So? There's gonna be
a new all-time champion.

393
00:24:53,118 --> 00:24:54,161
I think you've peaked.

394
00:24:54,244 --> 00:24:55,871
Hop on.

395
00:24:55,954 --> 00:24:58,081
Round one.

396
00:24:58,165 --> 00:25:01,376
My father, who, as you know,
is the lawyer for Sidarthur,

397
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:04,087
just called me to tell me what
he found out about the band.

398
00:25:04,129 --> 00:25:05,464
Oh, really?

399
00:25:05,506 --> 00:25:08,091
What he told me isn't available
to the public yet.

400
00:25:08,133 --> 00:25:11,428
Sidarthur's having a farewell
concert in New York next month.

401
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:14,765
Daddy already has V.I.P. seats,
but that's not the best part.

402
00:25:14,806 --> 00:25:16,642
I didn't think it would be.

403
00:25:19,645 --> 00:25:21,688
There's gonna be a party
afterwards at Stu's loft

404
00:25:21,772 --> 00:25:23,607
for all of Sidarthur's
closest friends.

405
00:25:23,649 --> 00:25:25,025
So I've heard.

406
00:25:25,108 --> 00:25:27,569
And guess who already
has an invitation?

407
00:25:29,321 --> 00:25:31,114
It just so happens
that Ella and I do.

408
00:25:31,156 --> 00:25:32,699
-Oh, really?
-Yeah, really.

409
00:25:32,783 --> 00:25:34,117
How'd you manage that?

410
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:36,370
Same way you did.
Through parental connections.

411
00:25:36,453 --> 00:25:39,456
What connections do you have
other than the phone?

412
00:25:48,173 --> 00:25:49,299
Winner.

413
00:25:49,341 --> 00:25:50,384
Me again.

414
00:25:50,467 --> 00:25:51,510
Loser.

415
00:25:51,593 --> 00:25:52,636
Game's not over yet.

416
00:25:52,719 --> 00:25:54,555
Round two.

417
00:25:55,639 --> 00:25:58,892
Actually, my mother
has the connections.

418
00:25:58,976 --> 00:26:01,144
Marsh Warner bought a piece
from her last summer.

419
00:26:01,186 --> 00:26:03,188
And Marshie, as I call him,
is their manager.

420
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:05,774
I know who he is.

421
00:26:06,358 --> 00:26:09,236
He remembered I was crazy about
Sidarthur, so he got us invited.

422
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:12,322
Wow, your mom
must be some potter.

423
00:26:28,213 --> 00:26:30,007
Winner.

424
00:26:30,549 --> 00:26:31,800
Me, Lola Steppe.

425
00:26:31,884 --> 00:26:32,926
Remember that name.

426
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:34,678
Loser.

427
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,846
Awesome!

428
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:50,986
Why did you tell Carla that
we were invited to his party?

429
00:26:51,069 --> 00:26:53,530
You would have done the exact
same thing if you were me.

430
00:26:53,572 --> 00:26:54,531
I wouldn't have lied.

431
00:26:54,573 --> 00:26:56,283
I would have thought
before I spoke.

432
00:26:56,366 --> 00:26:57,951
I can't even imagine being you.

433
00:26:58,035 --> 00:26:59,703
Carla Santini drives me insane.

434
00:26:59,745 --> 00:27:00,704
Don't even say that.

435
00:27:00,746 --> 00:27:02,664
Two of her nannies
were institutionalized.

436
00:27:02,748 --> 00:27:03,874
Not to worry.

437
00:27:03,957 --> 00:27:05,751
You just handed her
exactly what she needs

438
00:27:05,834 --> 00:27:07,377
to ridicule you
and humiliate you

439
00:27:07,461 --> 00:27:09,213
for the rest of your life,
and me, too!

440
00:27:09,254 --> 00:27:10,631
I guess it depends, doesn't it?

441
00:27:10,714 --> 00:27:11,882
Depends on what?

442
00:27:11,924 --> 00:27:13,467
Well, on whether we go.

443
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:14,885
To the concert?

444
00:27:14,927 --> 00:27:15,886
In New York?

445
00:27:15,928 --> 00:27:17,513
And the party.

446
00:27:17,846 --> 00:27:20,098
We haven't exactly been invited.

447
00:27:20,182 --> 00:27:22,434
You don't have to be invited
to a party like that.

448
00:27:22,518 --> 00:27:24,645
There are people
in New York that don't go out

449
00:27:24,728 --> 00:27:27,105
unless it's to crash
a celebrity bash.

450
00:27:27,147 --> 00:27:28,815
My mother would never let me go.

451
00:27:28,899 --> 00:27:30,776
We can work around
your mother, Ella.

452
00:27:30,859 --> 00:27:33,654
Tell the truth.
Are you partially insane?

453
00:27:33,737 --> 00:27:35,948
You know, we have to go.

454
00:27:36,031 --> 00:27:38,158
It's a matter of pride.

455
00:27:43,205 --> 00:27:45,415
Is there something wrong
with the salmon?

456
00:27:45,457 --> 00:27:47,417
No, just not very hungry.

457
00:27:47,459 --> 00:27:48,418
In too much pain.

458
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:50,921
I'm in pain, too.
My tooth's coming out.

459
00:27:50,963 --> 00:27:51,713
Oh!

460
00:27:51,797 --> 00:27:53,131
It's not that kind of pain.

461
00:27:53,215 --> 00:27:54,967
It's pain of the heart.

462
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:56,718
Sidarthur's broken up.

463
00:27:56,802 --> 00:27:58,679
They're having one last concert
in New York.

464
00:27:58,762 --> 00:28:00,639
That's it.
They're done.

465
00:28:01,139 --> 00:28:02,724
Good night, sweet princes.

466
00:28:02,808 --> 00:28:05,686
May choirs of rock angels
sing you to sleep.

467
00:28:05,769 --> 00:28:07,437
I have no reason
to live without them.

468
00:28:07,521 --> 00:28:09,106
Let me take a wild guess.

469
00:28:09,147 --> 00:28:11,108
You want to go to the concert.

470
00:28:11,149 --> 00:28:13,151
If I could just see them
play live.

471
00:28:13,193 --> 00:28:14,862
I'd have the memory
to carry me through

472
00:28:14,945 --> 00:28:18,532
the long, empty years that lie
ahead, like a road in Kansas.

473
00:28:18,615 --> 00:28:21,201
Okay, I don't think
that kids and rock concerts

474
00:28:21,285 --> 00:28:22,828
are a great mix.

475
00:28:22,911 --> 00:28:24,288
How can you treat me like this?

476
00:28:24,329 --> 00:28:25,873
I was your firstborn.

477
00:28:25,956 --> 00:28:28,500
You leaned over my crib
to make sure I was breathing.

478
00:28:28,584 --> 00:28:30,627
That's why I want to
keep you alive.

479
00:28:30,711 --> 00:28:33,630
She wouldn't even stop for the
tiniest, most subatomic second

480
00:28:33,672 --> 00:28:35,549
to consider
my fragile hopes and dreams.

481
00:28:35,632 --> 00:28:37,092
What did Ella's mother say?

482
00:28:37,176 --> 00:28:38,260
She didn't ask her.

483
00:28:38,343 --> 00:28:40,679
She said her mom would
bite off a $10 acrylic nail

484
00:28:40,721 --> 00:28:42,306
if she even brought it up.

485
00:28:42,639 --> 00:28:45,434
So I guess that's that.

486
00:28:45,517 --> 00:28:49,396
No, I'm not exactly a
"que será, será" kind of person.

487
00:28:50,022 --> 00:28:51,231
Right.

488
00:28:53,192 --> 00:28:55,027
I like your necklace.

489
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:56,153
Thanks.

490
00:28:56,195 --> 00:28:57,404
I've had it since I was 6.

491
00:28:57,487 --> 00:28:59,490
It's practically an antique.

492
00:29:00,991 --> 00:29:02,784
I like your boots.

493
00:29:02,868 --> 00:29:04,203
Thanks.

494
00:29:04,244 --> 00:29:06,246
I like your smile.

495
00:29:09,833 --> 00:29:13,504
Om.

496
00:29:14,046 --> 00:29:17,341
Om.

497
00:29:19,051 --> 00:29:20,802
Dinner, Mary, now.

498
00:29:20,886 --> 00:29:23,597
I'm on a hunger strike,
like Gandhi,

499
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,890
driven to desperate measures

500
00:29:24,973 --> 00:29:27,100
by the insensitivity
of the British government.

501
00:29:27,184 --> 00:29:28,852
Not one morsel will pass my lips

502
00:29:28,936 --> 00:29:30,646
until you say
I can go see Sidarthur.

503
00:29:30,729 --> 00:29:32,648
You have got two minutes
to get to this table

504
00:29:32,731 --> 00:29:34,233
or the insensitive
British government

505
00:29:34,316 --> 00:29:35,943
is gonna take the door
off its hinges

506
00:29:36,026 --> 00:29:37,361
and drag you out here.

507
00:29:39,738 --> 00:29:40,447
Hello?

508
00:29:40,531 --> 00:29:43,534
Om.

509
00:29:43,575 --> 00:29:44,868
Come in if you must.

510
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:46,161
Yeah.

511
00:29:46,245 --> 00:29:50,040
The thing is, the drama queen
has been Gandhi for two days.

512
00:29:50,082 --> 00:29:52,292
-I'll take her.
-Okay, I will try it.

513
00:29:52,376 --> 00:29:55,838
Your dad wants to know if
he can take you to the concert.

514
00:29:56,505 --> 00:29:58,298
Hi, Dad.

515
00:29:58,382 --> 00:30:01,343
Thanks for the invitation, but
I couldn't go with my father.

516
00:30:01,426 --> 00:30:03,303
I'd die of shame.

517
00:30:03,387 --> 00:30:04,388
Okay.
All right.

518
00:30:04,429 --> 00:30:05,931
-Love you.
-Love you, too.

519
00:30:05,973 --> 00:30:06,932
Bye.

520
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,519
Hello? Yeah.

521
00:30:10,602 --> 00:30:11,562
Mm-hmm.

522
00:30:11,603 --> 00:30:12,646
Okay.

523
00:30:12,729 --> 00:30:14,231
-Om.
-I'll try it.

524
00:30:14,314 --> 00:30:15,566
Okay, how about this?

525
00:30:15,607 --> 00:30:18,652
Daddy drops you off at the
concert and picks you up after.

526
00:30:18,735 --> 00:30:21,613
You mean like a little kid
being picked up from day-care?

527
00:30:21,655 --> 00:30:23,448
Is there no end
to the humiliation

528
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:25,868
you want to heap upon me, Mom?

529
00:30:25,951 --> 00:30:28,245
We're heaping humiliation.

530
00:30:28,287 --> 00:30:30,455
Yeah. Okay.

531
00:30:30,539 --> 00:30:31,456
Bye.

532
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:33,250
All right,
tonight you are eating.

533
00:30:33,292 --> 00:30:35,210
Is Mary going to die?

534
00:30:35,294 --> 00:30:36,503
She's not gonna die.

535
00:30:36,587 --> 00:30:40,048
But it smells like something
has died in here.

536
00:30:40,132 --> 00:30:42,259
What is that smell?

537
00:30:48,307 --> 00:30:50,142
Okay.
That's it.

538
00:30:50,225 --> 00:30:51,768
No allowance for one month,

539
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:54,688
and then you're gonna have
a parole hearing.

540
00:30:54,771 --> 00:30:56,940
But I could really use
the money now, Mom.

541
00:30:56,982 --> 00:30:59,693
Can't you take it away
next month or September?

542
00:30:59,776 --> 00:31:00,736
No.

543
00:31:00,819 --> 00:31:03,113
It's so cool.

544
00:31:05,365 --> 00:31:08,243
I have been looking
all over for you two.

545
00:31:08,327 --> 00:31:09,870
I knew you'd want to see these.

546
00:31:09,953 --> 00:31:11,580
See, they just came in the mail.

547
00:31:11,663 --> 00:31:13,499
They've just been printed.

548
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:15,375
Please, you're blocking my view.

549
00:31:15,459 --> 00:31:17,961
So, did you get yours yet?

550
00:31:18,045 --> 00:31:20,214
Actually, mine came
in the mail yesterday,

551
00:31:20,297 --> 00:31:22,174
but I'm nice enough
not to flaunt them.

552
00:31:22,257 --> 00:31:24,092
Why don't you admit
you don't have tickets

553
00:31:24,176 --> 00:31:26,011
or an invite
and get it over with?

554
00:31:26,053 --> 00:31:29,014
I'm sure there's gonna be
a lot of photographers there.

555
00:31:29,056 --> 00:31:31,517
Maybe we can even get
our pictures taken together.

556
00:31:31,558 --> 00:31:32,893
That's a deal.

557
00:31:32,976 --> 00:31:35,229
And you can be
in the shot, too, Ella.

558
00:31:38,315 --> 00:31:40,484
Absolutely.
I'll be there.

559
00:31:44,112 --> 00:31:45,531
Really?

560
00:31:47,699 --> 00:31:49,201
I guess.

561
00:31:49,743 --> 00:31:51,328
I have enough for both of us.

562
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:52,496
I'm gonna pay you back

563
00:31:52,579 --> 00:31:54,873
the second I get
my allowance reinstated.

564
00:31:54,957 --> 00:31:56,583
As soon as I get
my first starring role,

565
00:31:56,667 --> 00:31:58,043
I'm taking you to Europe.

566
00:31:58,085 --> 00:31:59,336
You sure we have enough?

567
00:32:06,718 --> 00:32:08,554
Oh, no.
Company.

568
00:32:08,595 --> 00:32:10,222
Wow, look who's here.

569
00:32:10,305 --> 00:32:15,352
I'd stay and chat, but l
don't want to stay and chat.

570
00:32:15,394 --> 00:32:17,104
She was so mean
to Callie Stevens,

571
00:32:17,187 --> 00:32:19,022
and her family had to move
to Cleveland.

572
00:32:19,064 --> 00:32:21,275
Catch you at the concert Friday.

573
00:32:21,358 --> 00:32:24,111
That would be a good line
if we were going.

574
00:32:24,194 --> 00:32:27,573
I don't think something as small
as tickets should stop us.

575
00:32:27,656 --> 00:32:28,657
Scalpers, Ella.

576
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:30,200
Part of the fun
in going to New York

577
00:32:30,242 --> 00:32:32,619
is dealing with
the slimeball scalpers.

578
00:32:32,703 --> 00:32:34,872
If we go, I just know
something is gonna go wrong.

579
00:32:34,955 --> 00:32:37,624
I'm gonna die, and my parents
are gonna find out.

580
00:32:37,958 --> 00:32:39,293
And then Mrs. Higgins says,

581
00:32:39,585 --> 00:32:41,044
"And what will you do now,
dear?"

582
00:32:41,086 --> 00:32:42,087
Hi.

583
00:32:42,129 --> 00:32:43,088
Hey, Mom.

584
00:32:43,172 --> 00:32:44,548
There's gonna be a cast party

585
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:47,009
at Carla "The Bad" Santini's
house after the show.

586
00:32:47,092 --> 00:32:48,927
Everyone's gonna be
really dressed up.

587
00:32:48,969 --> 00:32:49,970
It's my big night.

588
00:32:50,053 --> 00:32:51,847
I want to look
absolutely perfect.

589
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:53,473
Well, the car broke down today.

590
00:32:53,557 --> 00:32:55,225
That cost me $600.

591
00:32:55,267 --> 00:32:56,643
Plus I have to buy a new kiln.

592
00:32:56,727 --> 00:32:59,313
So, do you think you could look
absolutely perfect

593
00:32:59,396 --> 00:33:01,398
in something
that you already own?

594
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,066
Sure, I'll try
and find something.

595
00:33:03,108 --> 00:33:04,151
Yeah.

596
00:33:10,032 --> 00:33:11,867
Can you believe
64 hours from now

597
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:13,327
we'll be within
touching distance

598
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:15,287
from the man
who wrote so many great songs,

599
00:33:15,329 --> 00:33:17,372
and I still haven't found
something to wear?

600
00:33:22,503 --> 00:33:25,130
<i>What I needed for the concert
was a drop-dead-gorgeous dress</i>

601
00:33:25,214 --> 00:33:27,424
<i>that made me look 25
and sophisticated enough</i>

602
00:33:27,466 --> 00:33:29,510
<i>to have a perfume
named after me.</i>

603
00:33:29,593 --> 00:33:31,553
<i>This had to be really,
really special.</i>

604
00:33:31,637 --> 00:33:34,139
<i>It had to be glamorous,
and it had to make a statement.</i>

605
00:33:34,223 --> 00:33:36,934
<i>If I wanted Stu Wolff
to notice me, that is.</i>

606
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:43,982
Might as well just wear this
to see Stu.

607
00:33:44,066 --> 00:33:45,317
Nothing else to wear anyway.

608
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:48,195
I'm gonna be the dowdy redhead
who doesn't know how to dress.

609
00:33:51,615 --> 00:33:54,076
Don't worry, Ella,
I'll find something to wear.

610
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:55,953
I mean, accessories
are good, too.

611
00:33:55,994 --> 00:33:57,621
They'll help me.

612
00:33:58,872 --> 00:34:00,582
Don't cry.

613
00:34:01,458 --> 00:34:02,709
I can't lie!

614
00:34:02,793 --> 00:34:05,921
I can't say I'm sleeping over
at your house when I'm not.

615
00:34:06,004 --> 00:34:08,131
I can't go into New York
behind my parents' backs.

616
00:34:08,173 --> 00:34:09,508
I can't do it.

617
00:34:09,591 --> 00:34:11,635
We're not really
going behind their backs.

618
00:34:11,718 --> 00:34:14,263
They're gonna be in the city,
just not in the same venue.

619
00:34:14,346 --> 00:34:15,681
I'm not going.

620
00:34:15,764 --> 00:34:16,807
I'm not going.

621
00:34:16,890 --> 00:34:18,183
I'm not going.

622
00:34:18,267 --> 00:34:20,018
We're supposed to do
things like this.

623
00:34:20,102 --> 00:34:22,521
15-year-olds in other cultures
are grandmothers.

624
00:34:22,563 --> 00:34:24,356
No one gave them
permission to do that.

625
00:34:24,439 --> 00:34:25,983
It's not our fault
that the people

626
00:34:26,066 --> 00:34:27,317
who brought us into this world

627
00:34:27,401 --> 00:34:29,987
don't understand that we must
fly away from the nest.

628
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:32,072
Nature is telling us to go.

629
00:34:32,156 --> 00:34:33,991
And our parents are good people.

630
00:34:34,032 --> 00:34:35,784
They love us.

631
00:34:35,868 --> 00:34:37,202
Yeah, they love us, right?

632
00:34:37,244 --> 00:34:38,662
They really love us.

633
00:34:38,704 --> 00:34:41,540
I'm sure they'd hate
if anything happened to us.

634
00:34:45,002 --> 00:34:47,337
Wait here one second, okay?

635
00:34:48,338 --> 00:34:49,715
Don't cry.
It's gonna work out.

636
00:34:49,798 --> 00:34:51,884
We'll go, and it'll be fun.

637
00:34:52,384 --> 00:34:56,471
I can't lie!

638
00:34:57,890 --> 00:35:01,768
Mom, it's amazing how sometimes
I come to your conclusions.

639
00:35:01,852 --> 00:35:04,730
Ella and I could use,
as you say, adult supervision.

640
00:35:04,813 --> 00:35:06,815
-Uh-huh.
-So here's the plan.

641
00:35:06,899 --> 00:35:09,526
You drive us to the train
in broad, broad daylight.

642
00:35:09,568 --> 00:35:11,445
Ella's parents are
going to be in New York.

643
00:35:11,528 --> 00:35:15,073
They'd be happy to pick us up
at Grand Central Station.

644
00:35:15,157 --> 00:35:16,575
They'll drop us off
at the concert.

645
00:35:16,658 --> 00:35:18,410
We'll stay overnight
at their hotel.

646
00:35:18,494 --> 00:35:19,495
Sounds so safe, I know.

647
00:35:19,578 --> 00:35:21,288
I can't believe
it came out of my head.

648
00:35:21,371 --> 00:35:23,874
Okay, I'm gonna have to talk
with Ella's mom and dad.

649
00:35:23,957 --> 00:35:26,585
Of course, and when you do it,
do it gently.

650
00:35:26,668 --> 00:35:28,712
-They know nothing about this.
-Mary!

651
00:35:28,795 --> 00:35:30,756
And try and remember,
we're in suburbia.

652
00:35:30,797 --> 00:35:31,965
Yeah, yeah, I know.

653
00:35:32,049 --> 00:35:35,928
It wouldn't hurt if you threw in
that microwaves aren't that bad.

654
00:35:36,929 --> 00:35:40,891
Well, see, Mary feels
she really must see the concert.

655
00:35:40,974 --> 00:35:42,851
Is that how you feel, sweetie?

656
00:35:42,935 --> 00:35:47,064
You must see
these Sidarthur people?

657
00:35:47,105 --> 00:35:48,732
It's their last performance.

658
00:35:48,815 --> 00:35:51,777
Well, why didn't
you just ask, pumpkin?

659
00:35:52,319 --> 00:35:54,488
I didn't know I could.

660
00:35:55,656 --> 00:35:58,242
All right, your mother and l
are going into the city

661
00:35:58,325 --> 00:36:00,327
on Thursday for a long weekend.

662
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:01,370
We'll pick them up.

663
00:36:01,453 --> 00:36:03,080
They can stay with us
at the Hilton.

664
00:36:03,121 --> 00:36:05,082
Which is down the street
from the concert.

665
00:36:05,123 --> 00:36:06,959
Well, that would be great.

666
00:36:09,169 --> 00:36:11,964
Oh, it's as if the heavens
wanted this.

667
00:36:13,966 --> 00:36:16,552
Miss Baggoli,
someone broke the heel.

668
00:36:16,635 --> 00:36:18,262
No! Oh!

669
00:36:18,345 --> 00:36:20,722
Girls. Everybody.
Listen up.

670
00:36:20,806 --> 00:36:23,308
General announcement, everyone.

671
00:36:23,809 --> 00:36:27,980
Costumes are sacred.

672
00:36:28,063 --> 00:36:32,317
Costumes are sacred.

673
00:36:32,401 --> 00:36:34,319
Please.

674
00:36:34,361 --> 00:36:36,905
I mean, what does one wear
to Stu Wolff's party?

675
00:36:36,989 --> 00:36:39,116
There's gonna be
so many famous people there.

676
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:41,535
I don't know.
I just want to look hot.

677
00:36:41,618 --> 00:36:45,455
One wears what one usually wears
to these soirees.

678
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:40,177
Oh! Lola!

679
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:41,678
Lola, please!

680
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:42,971
Lola! Lola!

681
00:37:43,055 --> 00:37:45,015
Oh, my gosh!
Lola!

682
00:37:45,098 --> 00:37:47,434
<i>Crime has never appealed to me
as a way of life.</i>

683
00:37:47,518 --> 00:37:49,728
<i>But a girl's gotta do
what a girl's gotta do.</i>

684
00:37:49,811 --> 00:37:51,355
<i>I needed Eliza's dress.</i>

685
00:37:51,438 --> 00:37:53,190
You don't have to
do this for me.

686
00:37:53,232 --> 00:37:54,900
I know you said
you'd do me a favor.

687
00:37:54,983 --> 00:37:57,069
But this one may be too big.

688
00:37:57,152 --> 00:37:57,861
Don't worry.

689
00:37:57,945 --> 00:38:00,113
I'll be in and out
of the drama room in seconds.

690
00:38:00,197 --> 00:38:02,074
5, 6, 7, 8.

691
00:38:04,326 --> 00:38:06,537
<i>I know it's not like me
to be unprofessional,</i>

692
00:38:06,578 --> 00:38:09,706
<i>but how can I concentrate when
Sam is risking his life for me?</i>

693
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:13,877
<i>When in 10 hours' time I'll be
standing in front of Stu Wolff?</i>

694
00:38:21,927 --> 00:38:22,886
Oof.

695
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:26,056
Wait a minute.
No, no.

696
00:38:26,139 --> 00:38:28,934
Okay, everybody, that's enough!

697
00:38:28,976 --> 00:38:30,352
Excuse me, please!

698
00:38:32,604 --> 00:38:34,189
I'm sorry.

699
00:38:37,276 --> 00:38:38,694
Maybe you're messing up so much

700
00:38:38,777 --> 00:38:41,780
because you're so excited
about the concert tonight.

701
00:38:41,864 --> 00:38:43,532
No, I'm used to those things.

702
00:38:43,615 --> 00:38:46,076
Lola and Carla,
do you have to talk?

703
00:38:46,118 --> 00:38:48,704
Opening night is in one week.

704
00:38:48,787 --> 00:38:50,914
I would think
that we could just have

705
00:38:50,956 --> 00:38:55,002
one decent rehearsal by now!

706
00:38:55,669 --> 00:38:56,920
All right.

707
00:38:56,962 --> 00:38:59,798
What I think we'll do now
is we'll just breathe.

708
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,425
Breathe deep, and try and relax.

709
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:08,140
And another one.

710
00:39:09,391 --> 00:39:12,019
Shake it, shake it, shake it,
shake it, shake it.

711
00:39:12,102 --> 00:39:14,730
And you all just keep shaking
and relaxing.

712
00:39:14,813 --> 00:39:18,650
I'm gonna get something I need
out of the drama room.

713
00:39:18,692 --> 00:39:20,694
No, Miss Baggoli.
I'll get it for you.

714
00:39:20,777 --> 00:39:22,237
That's all right, Lola.

715
00:39:22,321 --> 00:39:25,199
What I need is locked up
in the drama room.

716
00:39:26,992 --> 00:39:28,619
But on page 42 of the script

717
00:39:28,702 --> 00:39:30,579
is where I want to
look down demurely.

718
00:39:30,662 --> 00:39:32,039
Lola, get out of my way!

719
00:39:33,624 --> 00:39:35,250
Can't we just go back
onto the stage?

720
00:39:35,334 --> 00:39:36,251
Miss Baggoli, please.

721
00:39:36,335 --> 00:39:37,961
Please, just get out of --

722
00:39:38,003 --> 00:39:41,965
Lola, would you please
get out of my way?

723
00:39:42,007 --> 00:39:42,966
That's odd.

724
00:39:43,008 --> 00:39:44,635
Why isn't this locked?

725
00:39:44,676 --> 00:39:45,928
Oh, my goodness.

726
00:39:46,011 --> 00:39:47,763
Hmm.

727
00:39:47,846 --> 00:39:49,681
But I always lock this door.

728
00:39:49,723 --> 00:39:52,226
You probably did lock it.
We have the same lock at home.

729
00:39:52,309 --> 00:39:55,562
Sometimes it works.
Sometimes it doesn't.

730
00:39:55,646 --> 00:39:57,272
You never know
what's gonna happen.

731
00:39:57,356 --> 00:39:58,106
Oh, oh.

732
00:39:58,190 --> 00:39:59,858
Okay, nothing
seems to be missing.

733
00:39:59,942 --> 00:40:01,485
Why would anything
be missing here?

734
00:40:01,527 --> 00:40:04,530
Well, I have no idea, do l?

735
00:40:04,571 --> 00:40:06,990
You know, I just want to
talk to you about my lines.

736
00:40:07,032 --> 00:40:08,534
I don't know them that well.

737
00:40:08,575 --> 00:40:10,244
You don't know your lines?

738
00:40:10,327 --> 00:40:12,996
At this time, I don't even
want to discuss this.

739
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:16,333
No, I'm not even gonna
discuss this right now.

740
00:40:30,389 --> 00:40:33,517
Lola, you're just making me
so nervous.

741
00:40:34,226 --> 00:40:36,854
Well, I need to show you
something on the stage.

742
00:40:36,895 --> 00:40:38,021
You know what I think?

743
00:40:38,063 --> 00:40:41,149
I think that you've just been
working so hard,

744
00:40:41,233 --> 00:40:42,568
entirely too hard,

745
00:40:42,609 --> 00:40:44,611
and that you should
just really try

746
00:40:44,695 --> 00:40:47,698
and take the weekend off
and relax, okay?

747
00:40:47,739 --> 00:40:49,575
I've never
really relaxed before.

748
00:40:49,616 --> 00:40:51,910
There's no reason I can't try.

749
00:40:51,952 --> 00:40:53,328
I think you should.

750
00:40:53,412 --> 00:40:55,956
I just think you should.

751
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,714
Oh, my gosh.
I was so terrified.

752
00:41:03,755 --> 00:41:04,381
I know.

753
00:41:04,423 --> 00:41:07,551
I was about to grab the dress
when Miss Baggoli came in.

754
00:41:07,593 --> 00:41:09,469
Thanks for trying.

755
00:41:09,928 --> 00:41:11,054
Trying?

756
00:41:13,515 --> 00:41:15,601
Take a look under the hood.

757
00:41:22,107 --> 00:41:24,234
Are you kidding me?

758
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:33,619
Hurry, I don't
want to miss the train.

759
00:41:33,702 --> 00:41:35,329
Wait for me!

760
00:41:42,419 --> 00:41:43,670
I don't believe it.

761
00:41:43,754 --> 00:41:45,964
I don't believe
you stole Eliza's dress.

762
00:41:46,048 --> 00:41:47,758
I didn't steal it.
I borrowed it.

763
00:41:47,799 --> 00:41:48,550
Borrowed?

764
00:41:48,634 --> 00:41:50,219
You mean you asked
if it was okay?

765
00:41:50,302 --> 00:41:52,137
Well, not exactly.
I mean, Sam --

766
00:41:52,221 --> 00:41:54,014
You got Sam to steal it for you?

767
00:41:54,097 --> 00:41:55,307
Borrowed it.
Sam borrowed it.

768
00:41:55,390 --> 00:41:57,100
It'll be back by Monday morning.

769
00:41:57,184 --> 00:41:58,936
Oh. Yeah.
I'm getting off.

770
00:41:58,977 --> 00:42:00,562
I can't go through with this.

771
00:42:00,646 --> 00:42:02,022
Ella, don't back out now.

772
00:42:02,105 --> 00:42:04,149
Please just let me have
one night of pure joy

773
00:42:04,233 --> 00:42:08,320
if I'm gonna have to spend the
rest of my youth behind bars.

774
00:42:08,654 --> 00:42:10,364
This better be
one great concert.

775
00:42:10,447 --> 00:42:11,824
That's a given.

776
00:42:11,865 --> 00:42:13,826
I don't want to
get near a scalper.

777
00:42:13,909 --> 00:42:15,327
You take the money, okay?

778
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:16,829
Okay.

779
00:43:28,484 --> 00:43:31,153
Wow, you look beautiful.

780
00:43:31,236 --> 00:43:32,446
You too, Lola.

781
00:43:32,529 --> 00:43:33,197
Thanks.

782
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,531
Yes, you do.

783
00:43:34,573 --> 00:43:35,949
Both of you.

784
00:43:36,033 --> 00:43:38,952
Now, the hotel is just
a few blocks from the theater.

785
00:43:39,036 --> 00:43:40,537
I know.
I know my New York.

786
00:43:40,621 --> 00:43:43,832
We'll be back
in the hotel room at 12:00.

787
00:43:43,916 --> 00:43:45,709
You have your tickets
and your money?

788
00:43:45,751 --> 00:43:46,710
We have the money.

789
00:43:46,752 --> 00:43:48,378
We'll buy the tickets.

790
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:49,129
Oh, here.

791
00:43:49,213 --> 00:43:50,964
Thank you.

792
00:43:51,048 --> 00:43:52,424
We'll drop you off.

793
00:43:52,466 --> 00:43:55,177
I can assure you,
everything is gonna be fine.

794
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:57,137
It's just a quiet
little concert.

795
00:44:12,861 --> 00:44:15,405
Okay, Ella, heads up.
March forward.

796
00:44:15,489 --> 00:44:17,407
-Get ready to rock 'n' roll.
-Girls, please.

797
00:44:17,449 --> 00:44:19,535
-Our tickets are at the door.
-Okay.

798
00:44:33,799 --> 00:44:35,425
Look for someone
who's selling tickets.

799
00:44:35,467 --> 00:44:37,219
Isn't there a stall
or something?

800
00:44:37,302 --> 00:44:40,764
No. They're just ordinary people
doing ordinary scalping.

801
00:44:41,306 --> 00:44:43,809
Watch this. You have to be
strict with these people.

802
00:44:43,892 --> 00:44:45,811
You have to bargain and deal.

803
00:44:45,894 --> 00:44:46,770
How much?

804
00:44:46,812 --> 00:44:49,064
$165 in orchestra.
Can't get any better than that.

805
00:44:49,147 --> 00:44:50,399
We'll take them.

806
00:44:50,482 --> 00:44:53,068
$165 doesn't leave us
very much for incidentals.

807
00:44:53,152 --> 00:44:56,572
When you get to see Stu Wolff,
you don't need incidentals.

808
00:44:56,905 --> 00:44:57,990
It's in your makeup bag.

809
00:44:58,073 --> 00:44:59,283
Oh, right.

810
00:45:03,495 --> 00:45:05,247
What's wrong?

811
00:45:06,206 --> 00:45:07,416
Ella, it's not here.

812
00:45:07,499 --> 00:45:09,459
My makeup bag's not here.

813
00:45:09,501 --> 00:45:10,460
It must be.

814
00:45:10,502 --> 00:45:12,421
It has to be.

815
00:45:12,504 --> 00:45:13,839
When did you last see it?

816
00:45:13,922 --> 00:45:14,840
In the train.

817
00:45:14,923 --> 00:45:18,510
I left it behind the sink.

818
00:45:18,844 --> 00:45:20,220
Oh, no.

819
00:45:20,929 --> 00:45:22,890
Oh.
Maybe it's karma.

820
00:45:22,973 --> 00:45:25,642
All we have to do is go in
with a large group of people.

821
00:45:25,726 --> 00:45:28,145
What?
You mean sneak in?

822
00:45:28,187 --> 00:45:29,563
Sneaking would be beneath us,

823
00:45:29,646 --> 00:45:33,567
but I can't think of a better
word for what we're about to do.

824
00:45:33,650 --> 00:45:35,903
I have never snuck ever.

825
00:45:35,986 --> 00:45:37,446
I can't do it.

826
00:45:37,529 --> 00:45:39,448
I'm terrified just being here.

827
00:45:39,531 --> 00:45:41,116
Stage fright.
It'll pass.

828
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:44,077
This is a little tricky,
so just follow my lead, okay?

829
00:45:44,161 --> 00:45:45,579
I wonder what song they'll do.

830
00:45:45,662 --> 00:45:47,206
I hope they do "Love Loser."

831
00:45:47,289 --> 00:45:48,499
Oh, I'm so excited!

832
00:45:48,582 --> 00:45:51,043
I feel like I've been waiting
for this forever.

833
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:54,379
Just a minute.

834
00:45:56,131 --> 00:45:58,550
Can I have another look
at your ticket, please?

835
00:46:00,052 --> 00:46:02,095
Right.
My ticket. Sure.

836
00:46:04,389 --> 00:46:06,141
You know, it's not here.

837
00:46:06,225 --> 00:46:08,185
I must have dropped it
or something.

838
00:46:09,686 --> 00:46:12,648
No ticket, no concert.

839
00:46:12,731 --> 00:46:14,525
I demand to see your supervisor.

840
00:46:14,566 --> 00:46:16,902
Yeah?
You can see him outside.

841
00:46:25,244 --> 00:46:27,246
Come to the door.

842
00:46:27,329 --> 00:46:30,916
Come to the door.

843
00:46:30,999 --> 00:46:33,001
Okay, go see Stu.

844
00:46:33,085 --> 00:46:35,337
Go see Stu.

845
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:36,839
Go see Stu!

846
00:46:36,922 --> 00:46:37,840
Okay, stay there.

847
00:46:37,923 --> 00:46:39,883
Don't move.
I'm coming in.

848
00:46:39,925 --> 00:46:41,426
I just have to be
with my cousin.

849
00:46:41,510 --> 00:46:43,804
She has this rare disease
that makes you gag

850
00:46:43,887 --> 00:46:45,848
and you can't breathe
and then you die.

851
00:46:45,931 --> 00:46:47,266
She shouldn't be left alone.

852
00:46:47,307 --> 00:46:50,227
She's alone, the one who's
gagging and not breathing.

853
00:46:50,269 --> 00:46:52,896
I have to be with her
at all times.

854
00:46:53,605 --> 00:46:54,982
Okay.

855
00:46:58,777 --> 00:47:00,445
Good plan.

856
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:06,618
Maybe we should just go
to the hotel.

857
00:47:06,702 --> 00:47:08,495
What?
And miss the concert?

858
00:47:08,579 --> 00:47:09,913
Yeah, I don't think so.

859
00:47:09,955 --> 00:47:11,748
We're not actually
at the concert.

860
00:47:11,832 --> 00:47:12,791
We're close.

861
00:47:12,833 --> 00:47:14,877
Stu Wolff's only
a few yards away from us.

862
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:17,421
And then he'll be
at the after-party with us.

863
00:47:17,504 --> 00:47:19,631
Your belief system amazes me.

864
00:47:20,132 --> 00:47:22,593
Ella, where are you going?

865
00:47:22,634 --> 00:47:24,428
Don't leave me!

866
00:47:24,469 --> 00:47:26,555
Come back!
Ella!

867
00:47:26,638 --> 00:47:28,473
Ella, what are you doing?

868
00:47:28,557 --> 00:47:30,142
I'm going back to the hotel.

869
00:47:30,225 --> 00:47:31,852
So you're just gonna give up?

870
00:47:31,935 --> 00:47:33,437
What if everyone gave up, Ella?

871
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:36,273
There'd be no America,
no electricity, no TiVo.

872
00:47:36,356 --> 00:47:38,901
We'd all have to watch our shows
at their scheduled times.

873
00:47:38,984 --> 00:47:41,278
We'd never get to see
the work of Renée Zellweger

874
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:42,946
or Christina Aguilera.

875
00:47:43,030 --> 00:47:43,989
If everyone gave up,

876
00:47:44,072 --> 00:47:46,783
we'd all be sitting in mud huts
in Europe eating weeds.

877
00:47:46,825 --> 00:47:48,035
I didn't say stop progress.

878
00:47:48,118 --> 00:47:50,120
I just said,
"Go back to the hotel."

879
00:47:50,204 --> 00:47:52,206
Don't you want to see
the look on Carla's face

880
00:47:52,289 --> 00:47:53,999
when we show up at that party?

881
00:47:54,082 --> 00:47:55,876
Yeah, I do.

882
00:47:55,959 --> 00:47:57,628
Great!
Then let's go to Soho.

883
00:47:57,669 --> 00:47:58,795
Where in Soho?

884
00:47:58,837 --> 00:48:00,339
We don't even know
where Stu lives.

885
00:48:00,422 --> 00:48:03,467
Sure, we do.
I have this.

886
00:48:08,013 --> 00:48:09,389
A picture of a door?

887
00:48:09,473 --> 00:48:10,641
It's not just a door.

888
00:48:10,682 --> 00:48:13,101
It's a black door with windows.

889
00:48:13,185 --> 00:48:14,394
Have some faith, Ella.

890
00:48:14,478 --> 00:48:16,855
Soho is New York's
artistic soul.

891
00:48:16,939 --> 00:48:18,148
It's just around the corner.

892
00:48:33,038 --> 00:48:35,541
67 blocks is around the corner?

893
00:48:44,716 --> 00:48:46,468
-Ready?
-Yeah.

894
00:48:52,975 --> 00:48:54,351
Ready?

895
00:48:54,393 --> 00:48:56,061
Ohh.

896
00:49:24,131 --> 00:49:26,592
There's a man following us.

897
00:49:27,134 --> 00:49:28,135
Don't be silly, Ella.

898
00:49:28,218 --> 00:49:30,429
The crime rate in New York
is going down.

899
00:49:32,973 --> 00:49:34,516
Come on.
Let's go.

900
00:49:44,443 --> 00:49:46,945
There's a man
and a dog following us.

901
00:49:49,406 --> 00:49:51,283
Okay. Stay here.
I'll handle this.

902
00:49:51,366 --> 00:49:53,035
New Yorkers
know how to handle trouble.

903
00:49:53,118 --> 00:49:53,911
Watch this.

904
00:49:53,952 --> 00:49:55,537
Hey! Hey!

905
00:49:56,121 --> 00:49:58,457
-Dad, what are you doing here?
-Your mom called.

906
00:49:58,540 --> 00:50:00,417
Asked me to keep an eye on you.

907
00:50:00,751 --> 00:50:02,252
She got nervous.

908
00:50:02,336 --> 00:50:04,421
Mom was born nervous.

909
00:50:04,505 --> 00:50:06,465
So, where are you going?

910
00:50:06,507 --> 00:50:07,758
To a party.

911
00:50:07,799 --> 00:50:09,843
Not like that.
You're all wet.

912
00:50:09,927 --> 00:50:12,387
Daddy, nothing can rain
on my parade.

913
00:50:12,471 --> 00:50:13,514
I like parties.

914
00:50:13,597 --> 00:50:14,848
Please, Dad, if you show up,

915
00:50:14,932 --> 00:50:16,683
then Stu Wolff
will never think I'm cool.

916
00:50:16,767 --> 00:50:18,268
Can't you wait outside
or something?

917
00:50:18,352 --> 00:50:20,103
Right outside.

918
00:50:20,145 --> 00:50:23,190
But if I see something even
slightly wrong, I'm coming in.

919
00:50:23,273 --> 00:50:24,775
You know, I really like parties.

920
00:50:24,817 --> 00:50:25,984
Thanks, Dad.

921
00:50:26,068 --> 00:50:27,110
And could you lay low?

922
00:50:27,152 --> 00:50:29,279
You're scaring my friend.

923
00:50:30,113 --> 00:50:31,490
Right.

924
00:50:31,532 --> 00:50:33,116
But I'll be watching.

925
00:50:34,493 --> 00:50:36,286
Well, he won't be
bothering us anymore.

926
00:50:36,328 --> 00:50:37,955
So, are you ready to have fun?

927
00:50:38,038 --> 00:50:39,289
I hope so.

928
00:50:39,331 --> 00:50:40,666
Okay. Good.

929
00:50:50,175 --> 00:50:51,635
Yeah!

930
00:50:55,681 --> 00:50:57,766
That was the Santini car.

931
00:51:41,226 --> 00:51:43,312
Hi! Lola Steppe.
Ella Gerard.

932
00:51:43,395 --> 00:51:44,354
Nice to see you again.

933
00:51:44,438 --> 00:51:46,356
I have to see your invitations.

934
00:51:46,398 --> 00:51:47,524
Strange you should ask.

935
00:51:47,566 --> 00:51:49,485
We left them at the concert.

936
00:51:50,235 --> 00:51:51,945
Our names should be on the list.

937
00:51:57,284 --> 00:51:58,869
There they are.

938
00:51:59,411 --> 00:52:01,038
Dr. And Mrs. Lawrence?

939
00:52:01,121 --> 00:52:01,788
Yeah.

940
00:52:01,872 --> 00:52:04,166
My mom and my dad.
They couldn't make it.

941
00:52:04,249 --> 00:52:07,002
My mom has a rash,
and my dad's in surgery.

942
00:52:07,085 --> 00:52:09,213
I thought your name was Steppe.

943
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:12,799
Could I just use your phone?
I have to call my parents.

944
00:52:12,883 --> 00:52:14,760
This is a private residence,
not Grand Central Station.

945
00:52:14,843 --> 00:52:16,512
Use a public phone.

946
00:52:18,305 --> 00:52:20,390
Whoa, whoa!

947
00:52:20,432 --> 00:52:21,767
Stu, this is your own party!

948
00:52:21,808 --> 00:52:23,727
It's your own party.

949
00:52:26,104 --> 00:52:28,482
You don't tell me
what to do anymore, Steve.

950
00:52:28,565 --> 00:52:29,942
Don't you remember?
It's over.

951
00:52:29,983 --> 00:52:32,236
Come inside before you
embarrass yourself.

952
00:52:32,277 --> 00:52:34,530
You touch me...

953
00:52:39,368 --> 00:52:40,369
Yeah, remember?

954
00:52:40,452 --> 00:52:43,539
He's been trouble
all over the world.

955
00:52:43,622 --> 00:52:45,791
Thank God he's not
our problem anymore.

956
00:52:45,874 --> 00:52:48,126
Steve! Steve!

957
00:52:48,210 --> 00:52:50,337
I love you.

958
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:53,340
Wait, let me just talk to you
for one minute.

959
00:52:55,926 --> 00:52:57,678
Except for the garbage
and the cars,

960
00:52:57,761 --> 00:52:59,555
it's like following Heathcliff
on the moors.

961
00:52:59,638 --> 00:53:01,598
-Maybe we shouldn't.
-Would you please relax?

962
00:53:01,682 --> 00:53:03,934
I'd rather lose him
than lose my life.

963
00:53:03,976 --> 00:53:07,104
-Where do you think he's going?
-Someplace great.

964
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:17,364
This for you is great?

965
00:53:17,447 --> 00:53:20,325
I'm getting really scared being
out here all alone, Lola.

966
00:53:20,367 --> 00:53:21,160
We're not alone.

967
00:53:21,243 --> 00:53:24,079
We're with an adult.

968
00:53:24,163 --> 00:53:26,415
Aside from the fact
that he isn't actually with us,

969
00:53:26,498 --> 00:53:27,916
he isn't actually an adult.

970
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,751
He's a rock star.

971
00:53:38,010 --> 00:53:39,261
Mr. Wolff?

972
00:53:39,344 --> 00:53:40,554
What?

973
00:53:40,637 --> 00:53:42,055
Come with me.

974
00:53:42,472 --> 00:53:44,141
Come on.
Help me get him out.

975
00:53:44,183 --> 00:53:45,642
Oh. Oh.

976
00:53:47,311 --> 00:53:49,396
He smells like
a backed-up drain.

977
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:52,191
Ella, Ella, Ella.
I mean, see the beauty.

978
00:53:52,274 --> 00:53:54,526
Oh, my God.
He's crying.

979
00:53:54,610 --> 00:53:57,196
Do you believe how lucky we are?

980
00:53:57,279 --> 00:53:59,907
I almost hear them praying
that we don't sit near them.

981
00:53:59,990 --> 00:54:03,327
Quickly get him into a booth
before anyone smells him.

982
00:54:04,995 --> 00:54:06,371
Ah.

983
00:54:06,413 --> 00:54:07,664
Ohh.

984
00:54:08,874 --> 00:54:11,835
Everybody wants something
from me.

985
00:54:11,877 --> 00:54:13,670
You think I'm a regular guy.

986
00:54:13,754 --> 00:54:16,006
I'm not a regular guy.

987
00:54:16,089 --> 00:54:19,968
Do you think anybody
really knows who I am?

988
00:54:20,594 --> 00:54:23,430
I don't even know who I am.

989
00:54:24,556 --> 00:54:26,058
Once we get some coffee in him,

990
00:54:26,141 --> 00:54:27,809
he'll become the man
of truth, passion,

991
00:54:27,893 --> 00:54:29,895
and unflagging courage
I know him to be.

992
00:54:29,978 --> 00:54:31,396
So, what will it be?

993
00:54:31,438 --> 00:54:34,149
Do you think I have
any real friends?

994
00:54:34,233 --> 00:54:35,442
We'll just have coffee.

995
00:54:35,526 --> 00:54:37,110
Not me.

996
00:54:37,194 --> 00:54:40,697
I'll have a deluxe hamburger
platter, well-done,

997
00:54:40,781 --> 00:54:43,700
and a large side of onion rings.

998
00:54:43,742 --> 00:54:45,118
You could just give him coffee.

999
00:54:45,202 --> 00:54:48,080
He's not really up to a meal
right now.

1000
00:54:48,121 --> 00:54:51,625
I want
a deluxe hamburger platter.

1001
00:54:51,708 --> 00:54:53,710
Is that too difficult?

1002
00:54:53,794 --> 00:54:55,254
You two better keep him in line.

1003
00:54:55,295 --> 00:54:58,298
The boss won't stand
for any nonsense.

1004
00:54:59,925 --> 00:55:01,468
What do you want?

1005
00:55:01,552 --> 00:55:03,011
Autographs?
Money?

1006
00:55:03,095 --> 00:55:04,054
A record deal?

1007
00:55:04,137 --> 00:55:07,224
Hey, there, girls,
do you want something from me?

1008
00:55:07,307 --> 00:55:09,977
This is a poet
who lit your darkest days?

1009
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:12,938
Didn't I tell you
he was a tortured soul?

1010
00:55:13,021 --> 00:55:15,399
Stu, do you have
any cash on you?

1011
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:17,901
We sort of left ours
on the train.

1012
00:55:18,235 --> 00:55:19,736
I knew you wanted money.

1013
00:55:19,778 --> 00:55:20,904
Look.

1014
00:55:22,781 --> 00:55:23,907
Nothing.

1015
00:55:26,243 --> 00:55:28,620
That's not onion rings.

1016
00:55:29,079 --> 00:55:30,247
Can you believe this?

1017
00:55:30,330 --> 00:55:33,083
We're actually having coffee
with Stu Wolff.

1018
00:55:33,125 --> 00:55:36,003
I have so much to ask you
about your work.

1019
00:55:37,421 --> 00:55:38,839
It's impossible
to talk to someone

1020
00:55:38,922 --> 00:55:40,382
who's had that much to drink.

1021
00:55:40,465 --> 00:55:43,302
You know, you just don't
understand the artistic soul.

1022
00:55:43,385 --> 00:55:46,388
He drinks so much to numb
the intensity of his feelings.

1023
00:55:46,471 --> 00:55:48,807
All geniuses do, Ella.

1024
00:55:48,891 --> 00:55:51,435
I want onion rings.

1025
00:55:51,977 --> 00:55:53,937
This is a donut!

1026
00:55:56,315 --> 00:55:58,025
I want onion rings.

1027
00:55:58,108 --> 00:55:59,234
Now.

1028
00:56:00,777 --> 00:56:03,822
What is wrong with
the service around here?

1029
00:56:03,906 --> 00:56:05,616
Are we together?

1030
00:56:05,991 --> 00:56:07,576
Who are you?

1031
00:56:07,659 --> 00:56:10,245
The fates have sort of
brought us together.

1032
00:56:10,329 --> 00:56:12,664
-This is Ella.
-Ella what?

1033
00:56:12,998 --> 00:56:13,790
Ella Gerard.

1034
00:56:13,832 --> 00:56:16,627
58 Birch Hollow Road,
Dellwood, New Jersey.

1035
00:56:16,668 --> 00:56:19,421
201-555-0199.

1036
00:56:19,505 --> 00:56:21,632
My parents are staying
at the New York Hilton.

1037
00:56:21,673 --> 00:56:24,092
I don't want to worry them
by being incarcerated.

1038
00:56:24,176 --> 00:56:25,677
It's my mother's birthday.

1039
00:56:25,761 --> 00:56:27,221
I bought her a rug.

1040
00:56:27,304 --> 00:56:28,931
Be quiet, Mr. Wolff.

1041
00:56:29,014 --> 00:56:30,140
You?

1042
00:56:30,516 --> 00:56:31,475
Lola Steppe.

1043
00:56:31,517 --> 00:56:33,352
My father's name
is Calum Steppe.

1044
00:56:33,435 --> 00:56:35,479
Address is 512 Bleecker Street.

1045
00:56:35,562 --> 00:56:38,732
212-555-0125.

1046
00:56:39,107 --> 00:56:40,317
All right, the three of you,

1047
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:42,903
sit over there
while I make some calls.

1048
00:56:43,237 --> 00:56:44,822
What's wrong with you?

1049
00:56:44,863 --> 00:56:46,657
Why did you lie like that
to the police?

1050
00:56:46,698 --> 00:56:49,201
They're gonna find out
that your father is dead.

1051
00:56:49,243 --> 00:56:50,202
What's going on?

1052
00:56:50,244 --> 00:56:52,246
-Who are you two?
-What's wrong with you?

1053
00:56:52,329 --> 00:56:54,706
You're not afraid of what
your parents are gonna say?

1054
00:56:54,748 --> 00:56:56,917
I'm resigned
to what life may bring,

1055
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,670
but why did you give
a false address?

1056
00:56:59,711 --> 00:57:02,506
You know, Ella, I think
your true soul and spirit

1057
00:57:02,548 --> 00:57:04,049
are finally beginning to emerge.

1058
00:57:04,091 --> 00:57:05,425
Why did you lie?

1059
00:57:05,509 --> 00:57:06,510
I didn't lie.

1060
00:57:06,552 --> 00:57:08,262
My father does live
on Bleecker Street.

1061
00:57:08,345 --> 00:57:11,640
And he has a rent-controlled
apartment and a dog named Negus.

1062
00:57:11,723 --> 00:57:15,102
You told me your father died
in a motorcycle accident.

1063
00:57:15,185 --> 00:57:17,354
So I exaggerated a little.

1064
00:57:17,396 --> 00:57:18,522
A little?

1065
00:57:18,605 --> 00:57:21,233
Exaggerating a little is saying
you're a little taller.

1066
00:57:21,316 --> 00:57:23,527
Saying your father is dead
when he's not

1067
00:57:23,569 --> 00:57:25,237
is lying beyond comprehension.

1068
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:26,613
Can we talk about this later?

1069
00:57:26,697 --> 00:57:28,323
We should tell Stu
what happened first.

1070
00:57:28,407 --> 00:57:29,741
You should tell me
what happened.

1071
00:57:29,825 --> 00:57:31,994
Why did you say
your father was dead?

1072
00:57:32,077 --> 00:57:33,203
He died?

1073
00:57:33,245 --> 00:57:34,788
When?

1074
00:57:34,872 --> 00:57:36,123
I had a reason.

1075
00:57:36,206 --> 00:57:37,833
And what was that?

1076
00:57:37,916 --> 00:57:38,542
The truth?

1077
00:57:38,584 --> 00:57:39,626
No, a lie will do.

1078
00:57:39,710 --> 00:57:40,669
Yes, the truth!

1079
00:57:40,752 --> 00:57:43,088
You do remember what that is,
don't you?

1080
00:57:43,130 --> 00:57:44,339
Were we in a diner?

1081
00:57:44,423 --> 00:57:46,425
I have an image of "Merry Xmas."

1082
00:57:46,508 --> 00:57:48,635
Just give me a moment.
I'd be happy to explain.

1083
00:57:48,719 --> 00:57:50,929
Right now I'm talking to her.

1084
00:57:51,013 --> 00:57:53,557
All right.
The total truth.

1085
00:57:54,766 --> 00:57:58,729
I lied because I wanted to make
myself seem more interesting.

1086
00:57:58,812 --> 00:58:00,731
More interesting?

1087
00:58:01,315 --> 00:58:04,568
We are 1,000 miles from home
in a New York police station

1088
00:58:04,610 --> 00:58:08,155
with a drunken rock star waiting
for your dead father to show up.

1089
00:58:08,238 --> 00:58:11,158
You want to be more interesting?
More interesting than what?

1090
00:58:11,241 --> 00:58:13,452
You know,
you just don't understand.

1091
00:58:13,535 --> 00:58:15,579
It was a new town
and a new school.

1092
00:58:15,621 --> 00:58:17,080
I understand.

1093
00:58:17,122 --> 00:58:18,916
And I lied for my mom.

1094
00:58:18,957 --> 00:58:20,584
I had to protect her
against suburbia.

1095
00:58:20,626 --> 00:58:21,919
Your parents didn't get her.

1096
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:24,463
So you killed your father?

1097
00:58:25,506 --> 00:58:26,965
Ella!

1098
00:58:27,049 --> 00:58:30,093
I would appreciate it
if you would just stop talking.

1099
00:58:30,135 --> 00:58:31,803
Ella, come on.

1100
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:43,148
What's going on?

1101
00:58:43,482 --> 00:58:44,441
Arrest that man!

1102
00:58:44,483 --> 00:58:45,442
He's a stalker.

1103
00:58:45,484 --> 00:58:46,652
Ella, Dad.
Dad, Ella.

1104
00:58:46,735 --> 00:58:48,278
Hi.
I'm Calum Steppe, her father.

1105
00:58:48,362 --> 00:58:49,321
What happened?

1106
00:58:49,363 --> 00:58:50,614
That's what I've been asking.

1107
00:58:50,697 --> 00:58:52,574
<i>As the night continued
to fall on the dark,</i>

1108
00:58:52,658 --> 00:58:54,284
<i>heartless streets
around the precinct,</i>

1109
00:58:54,326 --> 00:58:56,119
<i>the six of us gathered
around the sergeant,</i>

1110
00:58:56,203 --> 00:58:57,287
<i>and I told our tale.</i>

1111
00:58:57,371 --> 00:58:59,414
We were desperate to get
into this man's concert

1112
00:58:59,498 --> 00:59:02,376
because I consider him to be the
greatest poet since Shakespeare.

1113
00:59:02,459 --> 00:59:04,628
We lost our money,
and we couldn't pay a scalper.

1114
00:59:04,711 --> 00:59:06,421
Then we tried to crash his party

1115
00:59:06,505 --> 00:59:08,799
rather than have our dreams
forever denied.

1116
00:59:08,841 --> 00:59:10,133
When he stormed out of his loft,

1117
00:59:10,217 --> 00:59:12,469
we followed him to make sure
he didn't come into any harm.

1118
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:13,804
I'm having memory flashes.

1119
00:59:13,846 --> 00:59:15,597
I was passed out
amongst the rubbish.

1120
00:59:15,681 --> 00:59:17,307
I believe they helped me.

1121
00:59:17,391 --> 00:59:20,978
I know I should be furious,
but it's too late for fury.

1122
00:59:21,061 --> 00:59:22,813
I'm just thankful
nothing worse happened.

1123
00:59:22,896 --> 00:59:25,274
He looks like the dog
in "The Dog Years."

1124
00:59:25,357 --> 00:59:27,276
He is the dog
in "The Dog Years."

1125
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:29,820
He's the dog in "The Dog Years"?

1126
00:59:29,903 --> 00:59:31,655
My niece loves those books.

1127
00:59:31,697 --> 00:59:33,907
-You're famous!
-He's not as famous as you.

1128
00:59:33,991 --> 00:59:36,326
Molly's not gonna believe
I've actually met you.

1129
00:59:36,368 --> 00:59:38,620
Negus, right?

1130
00:59:38,704 --> 00:59:40,122
And Calum Steppe, right?

1131
00:59:40,205 --> 00:59:41,582
Right.

1132
00:59:41,665 --> 00:59:44,293
We checked your story,
and you're free to go.

1133
00:59:44,376 --> 00:59:46,587
-Excuse me, Mr. Wolff?
-Mm-hmm.

1134
00:59:46,670 --> 00:59:48,547
Can I have your autograph?

1135
00:59:48,589 --> 00:59:49,840
Oh, yeah, sure.

1136
00:59:49,882 --> 00:59:51,008
Sure.

1137
00:59:51,049 --> 00:59:54,428
To Sergeant Rose.

1138
00:59:54,511 --> 00:59:56,513
Stu Wolff.

1139
00:59:56,889 --> 00:59:58,724
Right, well,
now that that's settled,

1140
00:59:58,765 --> 01:00:02,311
would anyone like to come
to a party with me?

1141
01:00:02,394 --> 01:00:04,188
I would.

1142
01:00:14,031 --> 01:00:16,408
You can't stay mad
at me forever.

1143
01:00:16,742 --> 01:00:18,827
Forgive me, please?

1144
01:00:18,911 --> 01:00:20,871
I am in no way ready
to forgive you.

1145
01:00:20,913 --> 01:00:22,414
This is the party
of the century.

1146
01:00:22,498 --> 01:00:23,957
Don't you want to enjoy it?

1147
01:00:24,041 --> 01:00:26,335
I'm not really
in a partying mood.

1148
01:00:26,418 --> 01:00:28,045
Look, I'm sorry.

1149
01:00:28,128 --> 01:00:30,088
I really am.
I'm sorry.

1150
01:00:30,130 --> 01:00:32,174
You're just saying that
to save the evening.

1151
01:00:32,257 --> 01:00:33,300
No, I'm not.

1152
01:00:33,383 --> 01:00:36,303
I honestly don't know
what I'd do without you.

1153
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:39,223
What's going on?
Why are you still out here?

1154
01:00:39,306 --> 01:00:41,892
We just don't feel like
going in right now.

1155
01:00:41,934 --> 01:00:43,560
Well, then.

1156
01:00:43,644 --> 01:00:46,146
Let me get you
back to the hotel.

1157
01:00:49,441 --> 01:00:52,444
Maybe we can just go in
for a little while.

1158
01:01:02,246 --> 01:01:03,413
Hi!

1159
01:01:04,790 --> 01:01:06,625
There you are!
All right.

1160
01:01:06,708 --> 01:01:09,461
Listen, how about we get
you guys something dry to wear?

1161
01:01:09,545 --> 01:01:13,257
I'll have those dresses cleaned
and sent over to your dad's,

1162
01:01:13,298 --> 01:01:14,883
who is brilliant, by the way.

1163
01:01:14,967 --> 01:01:17,135
I think he and l
are gonna be pals.

1164
01:01:17,219 --> 01:01:18,637
Yeah, I bought all his books.

1165
01:01:25,978 --> 01:01:27,855
Just upstairs.

1166
01:01:27,938 --> 01:01:29,523
I don't see her, do you?

1167
01:01:29,606 --> 01:01:30,315
No.

1168
01:01:33,152 --> 01:01:34,611
Can you believe this?

1169
01:01:34,653 --> 01:01:37,072
We're in his clothes.

1170
01:01:37,948 --> 01:01:40,409
And in his bedroom.

1171
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:44,121
Come on, Ella.
Celebrate with me, please.

1172
01:01:47,958 --> 01:01:50,627
I want everything
to be okay between us.

1173
01:01:50,669 --> 01:01:52,379
And I do, too.

1174
01:01:53,714 --> 01:01:57,217
You have to promise that
you'll never lie to me again.

1175
01:01:57,301 --> 01:01:59,011
I do.
I promise.

1176
01:01:59,094 --> 01:02:01,305
I swear, Ella.
I do.

1177
01:02:02,014 --> 01:02:03,265
You promise?

1178
01:02:03,348 --> 01:02:04,808
I do.

1179
01:02:06,393 --> 01:02:07,394
Okay.

1180
01:02:08,437 --> 01:02:09,646
Okay, then.

1181
01:02:09,688 --> 01:02:11,482
Come on, we're in his room.

1182
01:02:11,940 --> 01:02:13,025
What do you want to do?

1183
01:02:13,108 --> 01:02:14,485
I don't know.

1184
01:02:56,527 --> 01:02:58,445
That is so gross.

1185
01:02:59,279 --> 01:03:00,531
Carla!

1186
01:03:00,614 --> 01:03:02,991
Hey, Carla!

1187
01:03:03,075 --> 01:03:05,452
We've been looking for you.

1188
01:03:07,412 --> 01:03:09,164
Did you see her face?

1189
01:03:09,248 --> 01:03:11,208
She looks really angry.

1190
01:03:11,291 --> 01:03:12,251
I know that look.

1191
01:03:12,292 --> 01:03:15,754
You know, life can be
so randomly beautiful.

1192
01:03:16,797 --> 01:03:18,841
<i>Come on, girls!</i>

1193
01:03:23,303 --> 01:03:24,179
Oh, my God!

1194
01:03:49,288 --> 01:03:50,914
My saviors.

1195
01:03:50,956 --> 01:03:52,791
Oh, my God.

1196
01:03:53,375 --> 01:03:54,877
Oh, it's Steve.

1197
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:56,086
-It's Steve!
-Hang on.

1198
01:03:56,128 --> 01:03:57,796
Stu, I know you're really busy.

1199
01:03:57,880 --> 01:03:59,798
I was wondering
if I could talk to you.

1200
01:03:59,882 --> 01:04:01,925
Why not?
Be my guest.

1201
01:04:02,634 --> 01:04:04,553
I can't believe I met you.

1202
01:04:04,636 --> 01:04:07,014
I mean, I can't believe
I'm sitting here with the man

1203
01:04:07,097 --> 01:04:09,892
who wrote all those songs
that made my spirit soar.

1204
01:04:09,975 --> 01:04:11,477
What were you thinking
when you wrote

1205
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:15,189
"behind some doors people
are waiting to sparkle"?

1206
01:04:16,523 --> 01:04:18,275
I have no idea.

1207
01:04:19,651 --> 01:04:21,737
But you wrote it.

1208
01:04:21,820 --> 01:04:24,531
Life's a little foggy,
a little soggy.

1209
01:04:25,365 --> 01:04:27,326
You know, that really
said something to me.

1210
01:04:27,409 --> 01:04:29,203
I'm sure to a hundred million
other girls,

1211
01:04:29,286 --> 01:04:31,205
but especially to me.

1212
01:04:31,788 --> 01:04:33,957
I'm happy to oblige a fan.

1213
01:04:33,999 --> 01:04:35,709
No.
I'm not just a fan.

1214
01:04:35,792 --> 01:04:38,170
I mean, I sat at your feet,
metaphorically.

1215
01:04:38,253 --> 01:04:40,172
When I listen to
"Always Morning,"

1216
01:04:40,214 --> 01:04:43,258
I wore a gray jacket because you
wore a gray jacket on the CD.

1217
01:04:43,342 --> 01:04:45,177
You wore gray
because it was ambiguous.

1218
01:04:45,260 --> 01:04:46,929
Am I right?

1219
01:04:47,012 --> 01:04:48,055
No.

1220
01:04:48,138 --> 01:04:49,389
I'm right.

1221
01:04:56,313 --> 01:04:58,899
You look disappointed.

1222
01:04:58,982 --> 01:05:00,776
Well, I am.

1223
01:05:00,859 --> 01:05:01,902
In me.

1224
01:05:01,985 --> 01:05:02,945
Yeah.

1225
01:05:03,028 --> 01:05:04,029
I mean, I still think

1226
01:05:04,112 --> 01:05:06,240
you're the greatest thing
since Shakespeare.

1227
01:05:06,323 --> 01:05:07,241
It's just too bad

1228
01:05:07,324 --> 01:05:10,494
I'll never be able to discuss
your poetry with you.

1229
01:05:10,577 --> 01:05:11,787
Why?

1230
01:05:11,870 --> 01:05:16,291
Because, Mr. Wolff,
you're a drunk.

1231
01:05:29,221 --> 01:05:32,724
I hope getting this thing back
is easier than getting it out.

1232
01:05:32,808 --> 01:05:34,101
Guess what!

1233
01:05:34,184 --> 01:05:35,227
I've been grounded.

1234
01:05:35,310 --> 01:05:38,021
Me too!
I'm so proud of you!

1235
01:05:39,398 --> 01:05:41,191
This is the day
I've been waiting for

1236
01:05:41,233 --> 01:05:43,735
since my first summer camp
when Carla told all the kids

1237
01:05:43,777 --> 01:05:46,530
that if they played with me,
they'd die.

1238
01:05:49,366 --> 01:05:50,284
She's smiling.

1239
01:05:50,367 --> 01:05:51,660
Oh, she's bluffing.

1240
01:05:53,453 --> 01:05:55,873
Well, look,
I gotta get to class.

1241
01:05:55,914 --> 01:05:57,541
Tell me how it goes.

1242
01:05:57,624 --> 01:05:59,877
Come on.
Let's watch her sink.

1243
01:06:00,627 --> 01:06:02,129
Yeah.

1244
01:06:02,212 --> 01:06:03,672
Yeah, this one.
Look at this one.

1245
01:06:03,755 --> 01:06:04,673
Hey, Carla.

1246
01:06:04,756 --> 01:06:05,924
Did you have fun?

1247
01:06:06,008 --> 01:06:08,135
Well, if it isn't
the great pretender.

1248
01:06:08,218 --> 01:06:10,721
Come to hear what
the Sidarthur party was like?

1249
01:06:10,804 --> 01:06:12,514
Why would we want to hear
what you have to say?

1250
01:06:12,598 --> 01:06:13,515
Ella and I were there.

1251
01:06:13,599 --> 01:06:15,893
Did you hear that?
She said they were there.

1252
01:06:15,934 --> 01:06:18,061
You know,
lying's not gonna help you.

1253
01:06:18,103 --> 01:06:20,564
Everybody already knows
that you didn't go.

1254
01:06:20,606 --> 01:06:22,065
Don't pretend you didn't see us.

1255
01:06:22,107 --> 01:06:23,150
I know you did.

1256
01:06:23,233 --> 01:06:24,985
It just so happens Ella
and I got in

1257
01:06:25,068 --> 01:06:26,528
because of Stu Wolff himself

1258
01:06:26,612 --> 01:06:28,238
after we practically
saved his life.

1259
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:29,072
Tell them, Ella.

1260
01:06:29,114 --> 01:06:31,909
I don't have anything to prove,
nor do you.

1261
01:06:31,992 --> 01:06:34,661
Ella, this is no time
for your newfound personality.

1262
01:06:34,745 --> 01:06:38,040
Maybe you'd like to see some
pictures from the party, Lola.

1263
01:06:38,123 --> 01:06:39,708
I know how fond you are
of Stu Wolff,

1264
01:06:39,791 --> 01:06:41,418
and I got some great shots
of him.

1265
01:06:41,502 --> 01:06:43,253
We spent the whole night
with Stu.

1266
01:06:43,337 --> 01:06:46,381
On the night of his biggest
party, he left to be with you.

1267
01:06:46,465 --> 01:06:47,758
You're not gonna get away
with this.

1268
01:06:47,799 --> 01:06:49,593
We were at that party.
My dad was there.

1269
01:06:49,676 --> 01:06:51,220
He and Stu are gonna
get together.

1270
01:06:51,303 --> 01:06:52,596
What dad?

1271
01:06:52,638 --> 01:06:54,515
You don't have a dad.

1272
01:06:54,598 --> 01:06:57,100
You said he died
before you moved here.

1273
01:06:57,184 --> 01:06:58,435
I mean, what do you do?

1274
01:06:58,477 --> 01:07:00,771
Do you just make all this up
as you go along?

1275
01:07:00,854 --> 01:07:04,024
Do you think because we're not
from New York that we're stupid?

1276
01:07:04,107 --> 01:07:05,025
You saw us there.

1277
01:07:05,108 --> 01:07:06,693
No, I didn't, liar.

1278
01:07:06,777 --> 01:07:09,446
You know, that's what you are.
You're a liar.

1279
01:07:09,488 --> 01:07:12,950
Your name isn't even Lola, Mary.

1280
01:07:13,992 --> 01:07:15,536
Ella's right.

1281
01:07:15,869 --> 01:07:18,330
I don't have to prove anything
to you people.

1282
01:07:18,413 --> 01:07:20,499
You know we were there.

1283
01:07:20,999 --> 01:07:22,709
Oh, no!
She's crying.

1284
01:07:22,793 --> 01:07:24,294
Look at the baby.

1285
01:07:24,378 --> 01:07:25,587
Oh.

1286
01:07:30,342 --> 01:07:32,678
Yo, you got no right to write
down what I'm saying.

1287
01:07:32,719 --> 01:07:34,054
Those are my --

1288
01:07:36,306 --> 01:07:38,934
I'm sorry, Miss Baggoli,
I can't go on.

1289
01:07:39,017 --> 01:07:40,394
There's something I have to say.

1290
01:07:40,477 --> 01:07:41,979
Well, quickly, Lola.
Quickly.

1291
01:07:42,020 --> 01:07:44,273
I have a confession to make.

1292
01:07:44,356 --> 01:07:46,900
I borrowed Eliza's dress
for the weekend.

1293
01:07:46,984 --> 01:07:49,862
I'm really sorry, but I felt
I had no other choice.

1294
01:07:49,945 --> 01:07:51,405
No choice?

1295
01:07:51,488 --> 01:07:52,698
Why?

1296
01:07:52,781 --> 01:07:54,825
I had to wear it
to the Sidarthur party.

1297
01:07:54,908 --> 01:07:57,411
When are you gonna
give it up, Mary?

1298
01:07:58,036 --> 01:07:59,037
No, you didn't.

1299
01:07:59,121 --> 01:08:00,581
You couldn't
have taken that dress

1300
01:08:00,664 --> 01:08:05,502
because I keep that dress locked
up safe in the drama room.

1301
01:08:05,544 --> 01:08:08,005
There are ways, Miss Baggoli.
There are ways.

1302
01:08:08,046 --> 01:08:09,756
Where is it now?

1303
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:12,134
It's right back.
It's safe and sound.

1304
01:08:12,217 --> 01:08:14,678
It looks exactly the same,
but somehow different.

1305
01:08:14,761 --> 01:08:16,263
Can you believe her?

1306
01:08:16,346 --> 01:08:17,973
I mean, first,
she takes the dress.

1307
01:08:18,056 --> 01:08:19,349
Then, she puts it back.

1308
01:08:19,391 --> 01:08:22,019
And then she goes to this party
where no one saw her.

1309
01:08:22,102 --> 01:08:23,770
It's true!
The dress got all wet.

1310
01:08:23,854 --> 01:08:25,814
Stu Wolff made me change
into something dry.

1311
01:08:25,898 --> 01:08:27,858
He said it was important
that I felt comfortable.

1312
01:08:27,941 --> 01:08:30,027
Because on the night
of his farewell concert,

1313
01:08:30,068 --> 01:08:33,447
Stu Wolff had nothing better
to do than see Mary Steppe dry.

1314
01:08:33,530 --> 01:08:34,490
Girls, please!

1315
01:08:34,573 --> 01:08:37,367
He sent it back to my dad in a
limousine as big as this stage.

1316
01:08:37,451 --> 01:08:38,827
A dress in a limousine.

1317
01:08:38,911 --> 01:08:40,329
Can you picture it?

1318
01:08:40,412 --> 01:08:43,290
He's also a big fan
of my dad and my dad's dog.

1319
01:08:43,373 --> 01:08:45,334
Then your dog gave him
his autograph, right?

1320
01:08:45,417 --> 01:08:47,836
But I did take the dress!

1321
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:50,631
See, Stu Wolff gave me this
himself.

1322
01:08:52,841 --> 01:08:55,677
It's his T-shirt from his tour.
Where would I have gotten it?

1323
01:08:55,761 --> 01:08:57,721
In a junk store
where you get everything else.

1324
01:08:57,805 --> 01:09:00,307
But this is the tissue I used
to wipe his tears.

1325
01:09:00,390 --> 01:09:02,768
Maybe we should send it off
for DNA testing.

1326
01:09:02,810 --> 01:09:04,770
I left my bottle-cap necklace
at his house.

1327
01:09:04,853 --> 01:09:06,647
He told my dad
he's gonna Fed-Ex it back.

1328
01:09:06,730 --> 01:09:09,399
A dress riding in a limousine.

1329
01:09:09,441 --> 01:09:10,609
I guess that's a good thing

1330
01:09:10,692 --> 01:09:13,904
because otherwise it would
have had to catch a cab.

1331
01:09:14,488 --> 01:09:16,698
You're funny, Lola.
You could be a comedienne.

1332
01:09:16,782 --> 01:09:20,410
But can we please
go back to work now?

1333
01:09:20,494 --> 01:09:23,455
We have so much to do
before Wednesday night.

1334
01:09:23,497 --> 01:09:24,748
You believe me, don't you?

1335
01:09:24,832 --> 01:09:26,208
Carla's the one who's lying.

1336
01:09:26,291 --> 01:09:30,128
We've worked so hard
for this production, Lola.

1337
01:09:30,212 --> 01:09:36,134
And I am not gonna let you
ruin it for me.

1338
01:09:39,471 --> 01:09:43,100
We have all had enough.

1339
01:09:43,976 --> 01:09:45,477
Have you?

1340
01:09:45,561 --> 01:09:48,272
Have you finally had enough?

1341
01:10:11,253 --> 01:10:14,673
<i>I sunk into a depression that
only Hamlet would recognize.</i>

1342
01:10:14,715 --> 01:10:17,593
<i>The one story I'd told that was
both probable and possible</i>

1343
01:10:17,676 --> 01:10:19,344
<i>was the one that was true.</i>

1344
01:10:19,428 --> 01:10:21,472
<i>And yet no one believed me.</i>

1345
01:10:21,805 --> 01:10:22,931
<i>Maybe you can never win</i>

1346
01:10:23,015 --> 01:10:25,642
<i>against the Carla Santinis
of this world.</i>

1347
01:10:25,684 --> 01:10:28,187
<i>I'd never felt
so totally defeated.</i>

1348
01:10:28,228 --> 01:10:30,981
<i>I felt more like a pigeon
than a flamingo.</i>

1349
01:10:31,565 --> 01:10:33,484
Mary?
Ella's here.

1350
01:10:33,525 --> 01:10:34,902
Go ahead.

1351
01:10:37,154 --> 01:10:38,405
I want to talk to you.

1352
01:10:38,489 --> 01:10:39,907
I don't really feel too well.

1353
01:10:39,990 --> 01:10:41,074
You can cut the crap.

1354
01:10:41,158 --> 01:10:42,701
I know what you're doing.

1355
01:10:42,784 --> 01:10:46,830
What happened to the most polite
girl in all of New Jersey?

1356
01:10:46,914 --> 01:10:50,083
What does it matter anymore?
We know we went to the party.

1357
01:10:50,167 --> 01:10:53,170
We know who we met
and what we did.

1358
01:10:54,213 --> 01:10:55,130
Get up!

1359
01:10:56,089 --> 01:10:57,049
I can't.

1360
01:10:57,090 --> 01:10:58,550
I just can't.

1361
01:10:59,885 --> 01:11:02,596
Has anyone seen Lola Steppe?

1362
01:11:03,305 --> 01:11:05,974
Has anyone seen Lola Steppe?
Lola?

1363
01:11:06,058 --> 01:11:07,476
You know, I really am sick.

1364
01:11:07,559 --> 01:11:08,519
I mean, ask my mom.

1365
01:11:08,602 --> 01:11:09,645
I'm not buying it.

1366
01:11:09,728 --> 01:11:11,188
You're bailing out of the play.

1367
01:11:11,271 --> 01:11:14,691
You know, here I am, so sick
this could turn into pneumonia,

1368
01:11:14,733 --> 01:11:17,611
and then I'll be on my deathbed,
and you're being accusatory.

1369
01:11:17,694 --> 01:11:19,947
You can't do this, Lola.

1370
01:11:20,030 --> 01:11:21,323
Everyone is depending on you.

1371
01:11:21,406 --> 01:11:23,575
What about your parents and Sam?

1372
01:11:23,659 --> 01:11:26,078
Sam has never been to
a school function in his life.

1373
01:11:26,119 --> 01:11:28,205
He's only going because of you.

1374
01:11:28,956 --> 01:11:29,957
Lola!

1375
01:11:30,040 --> 01:11:31,834
Lola Steppe, my Eliza.

1376
01:11:31,917 --> 01:11:33,544
Get out of my way.

1377
01:11:34,253 --> 01:11:36,547
One hour till curtain.

1378
01:11:39,341 --> 01:11:41,051
What about me?

1379
01:11:43,095 --> 01:11:47,099
I was miserable
until you came to Dellwood.

1380
01:11:47,182 --> 01:11:49,601
I thought everyone's life
was like mine.

1381
01:11:49,643 --> 01:11:51,311
Doing everything
you're supposed to do

1382
01:11:51,395 --> 01:11:53,313
when you're supposed to do it.

1383
01:11:53,814 --> 01:11:56,275
Never questioning anything.

1384
01:11:58,485 --> 01:12:00,946
The only thing I could expect
when I grew up

1385
01:12:01,029 --> 01:12:03,949
was a life like my parents'.

1386
01:12:05,033 --> 01:12:07,995
And then I met you.

1387
01:12:09,913 --> 01:12:12,666
You gave me courage, Lola.

1388
01:12:15,002 --> 01:12:18,422
Because of you, I'm brave enough
to be different.

1389
01:12:20,632 --> 01:12:22,759
Don't touch me!

1390
01:12:23,343 --> 01:12:25,095
You're a sham!

1391
01:12:25,971 --> 01:12:28,599
The one thing Carla
can't do anything about

1392
01:12:28,682 --> 01:12:30,017
is you being Eliza Doolittle.

1393
01:12:30,100 --> 01:12:32,269
You're just gonna
hand it to her.

1394
01:12:36,190 --> 01:12:37,608
Mary, I left word with your dad.

1395
01:12:37,649 --> 01:12:40,194
Should I call Miss Baggoli?

1396
01:12:46,283 --> 01:12:47,659
No.

1397
01:12:47,701 --> 01:12:50,287
I've had a miraculous recovery.

1398
01:13:00,797 --> 01:13:02,090
I need to be sure.

1399
01:13:02,174 --> 01:13:03,217
Are you up to this?

1400
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:05,636
Up to it? Miss Baggoli,
I was born to play Eliza.

1401
01:13:05,677 --> 01:13:07,596
Get into costume
for the opening.

1402
01:13:07,679 --> 01:13:08,972
Knock 'em dead!

1403
01:13:09,014 --> 01:13:10,516
Knock 'em dead!

1404
01:13:11,642 --> 01:13:14,520
It even amazes me that I get
everything that I want.

1405
01:13:17,523 --> 01:13:18,482
Get out of my dress.

1406
01:13:18,524 --> 01:13:20,818
-As of right now, I'm Eliza.
-Get out of my dress!

1407
01:13:20,901 --> 01:13:23,362
-Enjoy the show.
-Thanks. I will.

1408
01:13:23,403 --> 01:13:25,113
Oh, and get out
of my first costume!

1409
01:13:25,197 --> 01:13:26,990
Five minutes till curtain,
people.

1410
01:13:27,074 --> 01:13:28,492
Five minutes.

1411
01:13:31,537 --> 01:13:32,746
Get out of my dress.

1412
01:13:32,830 --> 01:13:33,497
No!

1413
01:13:33,539 --> 01:13:34,915
Get out of my dress!

1414
01:13:34,998 --> 01:13:36,917
-No!
-Get out of that dress!

1415
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:38,460
Ohh!

1416
01:13:39,378 --> 01:13:41,338
Sorry, Miss Baggoli.

1417
01:13:41,380 --> 01:13:42,798
I'm so glad to see you.

1418
01:13:46,051 --> 01:13:48,220
Do you want an ice cream?

1419
01:13:50,347 --> 01:13:51,431
Hey.

1420
01:13:51,515 --> 01:13:53,183
You're gonna be great.

1421
01:13:54,101 --> 01:13:55,686
I'm scared.
I'll admit it.

1422
01:13:55,727 --> 01:13:57,146
But I'm excited, too.

1423
01:13:57,229 --> 01:13:59,690
Don't be afraid.

1424
01:14:00,274 --> 01:14:02,234
You're gonna be wonderful, Lola.

1425
01:14:06,488 --> 01:14:08,782
You called me Lola.

1426
01:14:08,866 --> 01:14:10,868
You are a Lola.

1427
01:14:10,909 --> 01:14:12,161
Good luck!

1428
01:14:48,947 --> 01:14:51,575
Press your bars, children.

1429
01:15:12,679 --> 01:15:14,765
Yo, you gots no rights
to write down what I'm saying.

1430
01:15:14,848 --> 01:15:16,850
Those are my personal words.

1431
01:16:04,606 --> 01:16:06,316
Now say "New York."

1432
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:07,901
New Yolk.

1433
01:16:07,985 --> 01:16:09,444
New York.

1434
01:16:09,528 --> 01:16:11,029
With an "R."

1435
01:16:11,071 --> 01:16:12,573
New Rolk.

1436
01:16:14,533 --> 01:16:15,909
You can't talk.

1437
01:16:15,993 --> 01:16:18,036
Let's see if you can walk.

1438
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:19,830
Ugh!

1439
01:16:54,781 --> 01:16:57,493
They all accepted her
because of me.

1440
01:16:57,576 --> 01:16:59,328
All because of you?

1441
01:16:59,411 --> 01:17:01,205
I was there, too!

1442
01:17:01,288 --> 01:17:03,874
I worked hard to make you
look good!

1443
01:17:03,916 --> 01:17:06,210
Well, what will you
do now, dear?

1444
01:17:10,964 --> 01:17:12,841
I will be a teacher

1445
01:17:12,925 --> 01:17:15,302
because being a teacher
is the most worthy thing

1446
01:17:15,385 --> 01:17:17,137
a person can be.

1447
01:17:51,672 --> 01:17:53,006
Bravo!

1448
01:19:39,071 --> 01:19:41,073
Stu Wolff?

1449
01:19:41,532 --> 01:19:45,410
I don't believe this.

1450
01:19:46,328 --> 01:19:49,873
Did my father invite you here?

1451
01:19:50,541 --> 01:19:51,917
No.

1452
01:19:52,543 --> 01:19:53,627
May I come in anyway?

1453
01:19:53,710 --> 01:19:54,628
Yes!

1454
01:19:54,711 --> 01:19:56,296
Yeah, sure, of course.

1455
01:19:56,380 --> 01:19:58,382
I don't believe this.
This is crazy.

1456
01:19:58,423 --> 01:20:01,051
Lola's father said
she would be here.

1457
01:20:01,718 --> 01:20:04,888
You're here in my house
because of Lola?

1458
01:20:05,764 --> 01:20:07,432
You know what?
Why don't you stay here?

1459
01:20:07,516 --> 01:20:09,852
You stay.
And I'm gonna go get her.

1460
01:20:09,935 --> 01:20:11,562
And I'm gonna go get her.

1461
01:20:11,645 --> 01:20:12,688
You stay.

1462
01:20:12,771 --> 01:20:14,898
So I can't come in?

1463
01:20:24,032 --> 01:20:25,993
Look who came to see me.

1464
01:20:27,786 --> 01:20:28,745
Hey, guys.

1465
01:20:28,787 --> 01:20:30,289
Look who's here.

1466
01:20:30,372 --> 01:20:32,291
Is that Stu Wolff?

1467
01:20:32,624 --> 01:20:34,835
Look who came to my house.

1468
01:20:40,966 --> 01:20:43,427
Hey, Ella.
I just wanted to say --

1469
01:20:43,969 --> 01:20:45,179
Lola!

1470
01:20:51,018 --> 01:20:53,479
You left this at my place.

1471
01:21:12,039 --> 01:21:16,168
<i>I had pictured this moment
in my craziest, wildest dreams.</i>

1472
01:21:18,170 --> 01:21:20,088
<i>I guess if you don't dream
crazy and wild,</i>

1473
01:21:20,172 --> 01:21:23,801
<i>people like Stu Wolff don't
return your jewelry personally.</i>

1474
01:21:28,806 --> 01:21:29,598
Aah!

1475
01:21:44,655 --> 01:21:46,907
Come on.
It's just a hand.

1476
01:22:07,678 --> 01:22:09,346
Thanks for showing up.

1477
01:22:10,013 --> 01:22:11,849
So, how have you been?

1478
01:22:11,890 --> 01:22:13,100
Sober.

1479
01:22:13,183 --> 01:22:14,726
I'm in recovery.

1480
01:22:14,810 --> 01:22:15,811
Again.

1481
01:22:17,604 --> 01:22:22,776
Someone very sweet told me I was
a drunk, and I didn't like it.

1482
01:22:22,860 --> 01:22:24,736
Sounds kind of harsh.

1483
01:22:25,445 --> 01:22:26,864
But it woke me up.

1484
01:22:28,240 --> 01:22:31,869
So, maybe sometime soon we can
talk about your amazing music.

1485
01:22:31,910 --> 01:22:33,537
Just say when.

1486
01:22:33,579 --> 01:22:35,080
I can say when?

1487
01:22:35,122 --> 01:22:37,040
Within reason.

1488
01:22:41,086 --> 01:22:43,213
Would you like to dance?

1489
01:22:43,589 --> 01:22:44,798
Absolutely.

1490
01:23:02,483 --> 01:23:03,817
<i>Here's what I learned.</i>

1491
01:23:03,942 --> 01:23:06,653
<i>When you're happy,
the whole world's New York.</i>

1492
01:23:06,737 --> 01:23:08,864
<i>And that dreams are important.</i>

1493
01:23:08,947 --> 01:23:12,951
<i>Someday, when you're not
even looking, they find you.</i>

1494
01:23:15,954 --> 01:23:17,831
<i>And then there's Sam.</i>

1495
01:23:17,915 --> 01:23:19,124
<i>He'd been there all along,</i>

1496
01:23:19,208 --> 01:23:21,627
<i>but when I opened my heart
to him, I thought,</i>

1497
01:23:21,668 --> 01:23:25,088
<i>now that my career is launched,
maybe I could have a boyfriend.</i>

1498
01:23:43,649 --> 01:23:45,108
<i>It was the first time
I realized</i>

1499
01:23:45,192 --> 01:23:49,154
<i>that absolute reality could be
so much more fun than fantasy.</i>

1500
01:23:50,948 --> 01:23:53,200
<i>And can you believe
all of this happened</i>

1501
01:23:53,283 --> 01:23:57,120
<i>in Dellwood, New Jersey,
of all places?</i>
