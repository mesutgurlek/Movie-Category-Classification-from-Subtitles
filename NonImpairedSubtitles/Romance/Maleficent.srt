NARRATOR: <i>So you see,
the story is not quite as you were told,</i>

1007
01:27:20,653 --> 01:27:22,297
<i>and I should know,</i>

1008
01:27:22,322 --> 01:27:26,826

they called Sleeping Beauty.</i>

<i>In the end, my kingdom
was united not by a hero</i>

1012
01:28:07,367 --> 01:28:11,371
<i>but by one who was
both hero and villain.</i>

1013
01:28:12,413 --> 01:28:15,959
<i>And her name was Maleficent.</i>

01:29:14,726 --> 01:29:19,247
<i>And I know it's true</i>

1020
01:29:19,272 --> 01:29:25,820
<i>That visions are seldom all they seem</i>

1021
