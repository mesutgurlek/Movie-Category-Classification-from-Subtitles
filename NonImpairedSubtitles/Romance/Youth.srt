1
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,893
You can't smoke here.

2
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:27,187
What, even outside?

3
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:29,648
Not even inside.

4
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,069
Uh, well...
Pardon me, Mr. Ballinger.

5
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:36,405
Or may I call you ...

6
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:38,824
Maestro?

7
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:49,543
- May I ask how your holiday is going?
- Very well, thank you.

8
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,212
You've been coming here long?

9
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,341
I've been coming here for about twenty years.

10
00:02:57,051 --> 00:03:00,846
I used to come with my wife
and now I keep coming on my own.

11
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:03,849
Why... why Switzerland, Maestro?

12
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:07,686
Well, it's close to Italy,
and after London and New York ...

13
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:09,605
... I was director at the Venice orchestra.

14
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:11,857
- Of course!
- For twenty-four years.

15
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:13,859
Silly of me!

16
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:16,945
And are you still directing
or composing, Maestro?

17
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:19,448
No. I'm retired.

18
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:25,245
Maestro, as I indicated you
In my letter, I work ...

19
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:27,998
... For the Entitlements and Events
Office at the Buckingham Palace.

20
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:32,002
- You work for the Queen?
- In a sense, yes.

21
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:34,713
Good. I find Monarchies
so endearing.

22
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:37,758
If I may, Maestro ...

23
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:40,886
Why exactly do You find
the monarchy endearing?

24
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:43,263
Well, because it's so vulnerable.

25
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:46,600
You eliminate one person ...

26
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:48,852
... And all of a sudden ...

27
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,480
... The whole world changes.

28
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:57,027
Like in a marriage.

29
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:02,991
Maestro, Her Majesty The Queen
would be honoured to confer ..

30
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:05,410
... The knighthood upon You
this coming June.

31
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:09,915
- Good. - Her Majesty The Queen will be
de-lighted to learn you've accepted.

32
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:15,170
Her Majesty The Queen has never been
de-lighted at anything.

33
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:17,422
Well... What is more

34
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:21,385
Your investiture,
just so happens to coincide ...

35
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:24,554
... With the birthday of His Royal
Highness the Prince Philip.

36
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:28,892
And the queen would very much like
to give him a concert by the BBC orchestra.

37
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:31,144
I don’t conduct any more.

38
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:35,274
- I'm sure you have not
forgotten how it's done. - No.

39
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:37,776
I haven't forgotten
how it's done.

40
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:40,696
Prince Philip and the Queen
will be simply ecstatic ...

41
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:43,949
... To hear you conduct your famous
"Simple Songs".

42
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:50,455
I wil not conduct
my "Simple Songs".

43
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:53,083
Why not?

44
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:55,961
Personal reasons.

45
00:04:57,213 --> 00:05:00,340
The great soprano Sumi Jo
has agreed to sing.

46
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:02,050
Sumi Jo won't do.

47
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:05,595
Tell me which soprano will do
and you should have her.

48
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:09,933
No one will do.

49
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:43,884
Very well.

50
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,970
I shall relay our conversation
to the Queen.

51
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:53,352
Good day, Maestro.

52
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,036
Do you see that?

53
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:14,039
Is that him?

54
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:15,749
Why yes...

55
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,502
It is! God!

56
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:22,547
Angela!

57
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:52,220
Melanie! Melanie!

58
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:05,168
I was thinking today how You
and I have the same problem.

59
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:08,964
- Is that so? - We've been
misunderstood our whole lives ...

60
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:15,345
... because we are allowed ourselves
to give in just once to a little levity.

61
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:18,723
Levity is an
irresistible temptation.

62
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:26,231
I worked with all the great
European and American directors...

63
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:31,111
... But I'll be remembered
forever for "Mister Q".

64
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:34,322
For a fucking robot.

65
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:39,119
I had to wear suit of armour
that weighted two hundred pounds.

66
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:40,745
You couldn't even see my face.

67
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:44,124
But every five minutes somebody
has to come up and remind me ...

68
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,209
... I did "Mister Q".

69
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:51,089
The same way they remind You
that You did the "Simple Songs".

70
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:54,342
And they forget ...

71
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:57,971
That you also composed
"The Black Prism" ...

72
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:01,516
... "Life of Hadrian" and all the rest.

73
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:05,103
Because levity also ...

74
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,230
A perversion.

75
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:12,235
What are you doing in Europe?

76
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:17,032
I'm doing a new film in Germany.
Starting in a month.

77
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:22,162
- I am developing the role.
- Is it a light-hearted role?

78
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:24,289
That depends on your point of view.

79
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,791
And is all going well?

80
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:31,796
We'll see.

81
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:36,384
Well, it's late for me.

82
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,136
Not for me.

83
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:39,679
Good night.

84
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:41,116
Did You take a piss today?

85
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:43,702
Twice.

86
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:49,749
- Four drops. You?
- Same. More or less.

87
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,751
More? Or less?

88
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:54,212
Less.

89
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:59,843
Look how beautiful they are.

90
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:01,640
Beautiful

91
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,140
If you only knew how moving it is
to see them working on the script.

92
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:06,975
They're so passionate.

93
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:09,227
You see these two?

94
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:13,898
They are falling in love
but they don't know it yet.

95
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:17,026
- And how do you know?
- I know because I know ...

96
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:20,155
... Everything there is
to know about love.

97
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:23,116
Maybe you'll have to give me
some lessons ... one day.

98
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:25,285
It's late now.

99
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:29,650
- Have you heard the latest?
- No.

100
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:34,669
Joyce Owens, Miss Universe,
is coming to stay.

101
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:38,298
Apparently, one of her prizes is
a free week in our hotel.

102
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:40,300
Yeah, I heard.

103
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:43,428
But It seems more like a punishment
than a prize to me.

104
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:45,805
How's the script coming?

105
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:47,682
It's going to be masterpiece.

106
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:50,810
And my testament.

107
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:55,273
And Brenda is going to be
an unforgettable leading lady.

108
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:57,567
We came upon a title today:

109
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:00,779
"Life's last day."

110
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:02,697
What do you think?

111
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:05,450
that's good, good.

112
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:08,453
I'm going to get some sleep.

113
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,581
Good night!

114
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:15,210
Good night.

115
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:55,560
That guy who levitates is out here.

116
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,313
I've been coming here for years.

117
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:01,065
He has never levitated.

118
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:06,696
So, where did You decide to go?

119
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:11,034
We're going to Polynesia
for two weeks.

120
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:13,536
- Julian might go overboard
as usual. - Good.

121
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:17,040
You're going to be be glad to have the room
to yourself now. I've just been at your way.

122
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,709
Not at all. You've kept me company.

123
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:21,961
Mick is working ...

124
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:24,464
- And I get bored.
- You're not gonna be bored for a minute ...

125
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:28,301
... Because I have arranged the full service
for you: You're going to have

126
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:33,097
a massage, sauna, check ups
with the doctor every single day.

127
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:36,059
To help you get back in shape.

128
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:39,354
At my age, getting in shape
is merely a waste of time.

129
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:41,189
And I will get even more bored.

130
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:43,983
You are victim of your own
apathies, Daddy.

131
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:47,070
Why don't you guys go to Venice
one of these days?

132
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:49,948
You could bring flowers to Mommy.

133
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:00,583
I've been meaning to tell you...

134
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:03,836
The French have emailed me
every single day. They ...

135
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:07,882
Insist that you write your
memoires. What should I do?

136
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,845
Let them insist.

137
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,360
I'm going to call you
as soon as I get there.

138
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:32,907
Bye Daddy.

139
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:34,867
Have fun!

140
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:40,873
Would you mind turning
on your back, please?

141
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:17,285
After pain come pleasure.

142
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:20,329
And then ... pain again.

143
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:30,840
- How is it going, Mr. Ballinger?
- It's going.

144
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:33,468
I don't know where, but it's going.

145
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:45,104
My daughter says I'm apathetic.

146
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:48,733
You see ... Is it that obvious?

147
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:54,238
You've been watching too many movies,
you idiot, you've forgotten what life is about.

148
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:55,865
- Exactly!
- Well, movies are life!

149
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:57,366
All you know how to do is criticize

150
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:59,077
If you only has some inspiration
for once ...

151
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:00,745
Exactly!

152
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:03,122
Inspiration! Didn't they teach at the film
school that inspiration does not exist?

153
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:05,124
Inspiration is a lie.

154
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:08,336
There is no such thing as inspiration.
Only fermentation.

155
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:09,879
- Exactly.
- Inspiration exists, all right ...

156
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:12,256
You just don't recognise it
because you have zero talent.

157
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:15,384
- Exactly.
- What the fuck are you doing?

158
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:17,637
- Agreeing with everyone?
- Yeah, of course!

159
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:19,889
I am timid and insecure.

160
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:22,642
My parents never gave me
any encouragement.

161
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:24,227
I never had a girlfriend ...

162
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:27,355
And I have some serious doubts
about my sexual orientation.

163
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:29,524
Stop! It'll not go into move.

164
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:31,776
Well I has polio.

165
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:35,279
Don't you dare to accuse me of having
no talent again, you idiot.

166
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:37,907
Now there is not the time for fermentation.
You talentless parasite!

167
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:40,743
That's enough, you're really
getting on my nerves.

168
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,662
We have to come up with an ending.

169
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,414
And you waste your time
talking Philosophy and Big Ideas.

170
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,500
He is on his deathbed ...

171
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:49,669
He can barely talk ...

172
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,421
He whispers to his wife:

173
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:54,799
"Don't cry, honey."

174
00:18:55,134 --> 00:19:00,513
"You know, I've always found women
who weep frivolent and repulsive. "

175
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:03,057
- Nice!
- That's a totally asinine idea.

176
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:04,809
What else?

177
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:24,954
You won't fool me!

178
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:28,833
I know that you can't levitate.

179
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,379
That's everything?

180
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:23,137
Don't you need anything?

181
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:36,150
- What do you need band-aids for?
- I don't.

182
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:39,737
I'm doing it out of solidarity
with you.

183
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:42,657
Ah, fuck you.

184
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:50,998
You pay.

185
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:54,418
Do you remember Gilda?

186
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:58,130
- The film?
- No, Gilda Black.

187
00:20:58,173 --> 00:21:01,300
The girl that we were both
in love with.

188
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:03,636
Gilda Black?

189
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:07,014
What are you ...
Have to remind me up for?

190
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:09,308
That was a hundred years ago.

191
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:13,187
To me it seems like yesterday.

192
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:18,651
I would have given twenty years of my life
to have slept with her.

193
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:21,070
Well, that would've been
a pretty stupid thing.

194
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:24,073
Guilda Black wasn't worth
twenty years of life.

195
00:21:24,157 --> 00:21:26,284
She wasn't worth a single day.

196
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:29,787
How do you know?

197
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:32,790
Did you sleep with her?

198
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:35,084
What? What did you say?

199
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:37,086
You heard me.

200
00:21:37,212 --> 00:21:39,547
Sixty years ago you swore
you never slept with her ...

201
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:41,966
... out of respect of my love for her.

202
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:44,593
Now you've changed your tune.

203
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:48,848
Look...

204
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:52,226
- I have something to confess.
- Fine, go ahead!

205
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:54,437
The real tragedy ...

206
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:57,481
And, believe me, it really is a tragedy ...

207
00:21:57,858 --> 00:22:01,861
Is that I can't even remember
if I slept with Gilda Black.

208
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:05,948
- Are you serious?
- I swear.

209
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:13,998
I'm wondering what happens
to your memory over time.

210
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:18,627
I can't remember my family.

211
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:21,005
I don't remember...

212
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,133
Their faces or how they talked.

213
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:30,264
Last night I was watching Lena
while she was asleep.

214
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:33,642
And I was thinking about
all the thousands of little things ...

215
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:37,271
... That I done for her as her father.

216
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:42,651
And I done them deliberately
so that she would remember them ...

217
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:44,904
... When she grows up.

218
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:47,114
But in time ...

219
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:49,909
... She won't remember a single thing.

220
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:55,998
Tremendous effort, Mick,
you know.

221
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:01,045
Tremendous efforts, Mick.

222
00:23:02,255 --> 00:23:04,131
With a modest result.

223
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:23,312
They're going to talk tonight, mostly.

224
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:27,191
I will bet you thirty Swiss francs ...

225
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:30,152
... They don't say a word
the entire dinner.

226
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:33,697
I'm so sure they are going to talk.

227
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:37,785
- I'll raise you to fifty.
- Done.

228
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:48,295
Including the last few days, err ...

229
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:53,842
... You owe me 250 Swiss francs.

230
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,866
Today?

231
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:20,619
Not today. You?

232
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:25,499
Nothing.

233
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:29,753
Let's hope we take a piss tomorrow.

234
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:13,797
That's great, Nick.

235
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:16,550
I'm glad you liked
the second draft.

236
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:18,510
Sure, we will work some more
on the ending.

237
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:20,554
I'll talk to Brenda,
everything is all set.

238
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:25,059
She can't wait. When is she ever going
to get a part like this at her age, come on!

239
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:29,688
If it's okay with you, I'd like to start
scouting locations next month

240
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:31,774
- Perfect. Bye!
- Yeah.

241
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:34,943
What happened to you?

242
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:38,072
You look like you've been to a funeral.

243
00:27:39,699 --> 00:27:41,450
Your son...

244
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:44,328
- Has left my daughter.
- Fuck!

245
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:47,581
- What are you talking about?
- They were boarding a plane to Polynesia.

246
00:27:47,707 --> 00:27:50,417
And right there, in the tunnel
he stops ...

247
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:55,339
... And tells her that he's fallen
in love with another woman.

248
00:27:56,841 --> 00:28:00,344
Nothing like being in the tunnel
to make you feel you are in the tunnel.

249
00:28:00,428 --> 00:28:04,348
How fond! You're quite a magician
of metaphor.

250
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:06,850
And he took this other woman
on vacation?

251
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:10,187
At least he had the good taste
not to do so. At least

252
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:11,730
And Lena?

253
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:13,982
Lena is in her room.
Crying her eyes out.

254
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:17,486
I've never seen anyone crying
that much in my life.

255
00:28:17,612 --> 00:28:20,489
I read somewhere that tear ducts
can produce tears for three days ...

256
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:23,242
... Without stop.
- Yeah, I heard that too.

257
00:28:23,326 --> 00:28:26,328
- Yep.
- It was in that BBC documentary.

258
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:28,580
He's on his deathbed
and he says to her:

259
00:28:28,623 --> 00:28:32,876
"Let's watch one more final
BBC documentary together, darling. "

260
00:28:33,002 --> 00:28:34,086
Okay, guys, knock it off.

261
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:37,756
I'm not sure that's true, though.
About the tear ducts. I read that ...

262
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:39,466
... Somewhere in the popular magazine ...

263
00:28:39,509 --> 00:28:42,386
... And they tend to exaggerate.
Better for sales.

264
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:45,889
- I think you're getting off the mark.
- I think you're right.

265
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:48,517
Julian is such a shit!

266
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:53,021
- Just like his mother. Remember? - Yeah.
- I'm going to call my shithead son.

267
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:56,650
What are you gonna do? Try and convince him
to get back with Lena? It's hopeless.

268
00:28:56,776 --> 00:29:00,988
Julian, this is your father. Even though,
at this point, based on the evidences ...

269
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:03,157
... I'm not so sure
you're my son.

270
00:29:34,522 --> 00:29:38,317
How are you always
so sure...

271
00:29:38,401 --> 00:29:40,319
... They aren't going to speak?

272
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:43,405
I know something about them.

273
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:45,949
- The waiter told me.
- What?

274
00:29:46,075 --> 00:29:49,077
- I'm not going to tell you.
- Tell me right this minute.

275
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:52,206
Besides, I can always get the waiter
to tell me too ... With a bribe.

276
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:54,792
All right, I'll tell you.

277
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:57,336
They are mute.

278
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:00,839
You little shit!

279
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:03,217
Give me back my money! All of it!

280
00:30:03,426 --> 00:30:05,344
You're so gullible!

281
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,721
It was a joke.
They are not mute.

282
00:30:18,107 --> 00:30:20,192
What the hell is going on?

283
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:22,444
Well, that's really rather banal, Dad.

284
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:24,738
I fell in love with
another woman.

285
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:27,866
- It was all of eighteen, right?
- No, Dad, she is not eighteen.

286
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:29,743
She is thirty. Reasonable age.

287
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:32,746
Well, however old she is,
You've really fucked up.

288
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:34,206
That is your opinion.

289
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:37,125
Lena is
an extraordinary woman.

290
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:40,504
- At this point, of course, you've realized that
she is completely wasted on you. - Perhaps.

291
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:44,132
- She is far too intelligent for you.
- Why did you make me come here?

292
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:47,386
- I'm not about to change my mind.
- That's what they all say at the beginning.

293
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:50,764
Then eventually they wind up begging
their spouse to take them back.

294
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:54,852
Mom left you.
She never begged you to take her back.

295
00:30:57,897 --> 00:31:00,107
What did I tell you?

296
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:02,734
You see now where he gets this from,
this asshole?

297
00:31:02,777 --> 00:31:07,406
- Well, are we allowed to know who this whore
that you've fallen in love with? - Me.

298
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:10,659
I am the woman Julian
lost his head for.

299
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:13,537
Ad we're going to get married
as soon as his divorce is finalized.

300
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:16,290
And who the fuck are you?

301
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:18,792
I'm Paloma Faith.

302
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:22,296
And I'm not a whore ...
I'm the singer.

303
00:31:22,922 --> 00:31:26,300
Excuse me, miss ...
Do you mind giving us a moment alone?

304
00:31:27,927 --> 00:31:30,804
Okay, but not for too long.

305
00:31:32,181 --> 00:31:34,308
Forgive me, Julian.

306
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:36,810
But I'm really trying to understand ...

307
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:40,898
Lena is a beautiful woman,
a dream.

308
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:47,070
And this one here is the most
insignificant woman on the face of the planet.

309
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:50,032
What the fuck do you see in her?

310
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:55,412
- You really want to know?
- Yes, Julian, I really want to know.

311
00:32:05,548 --> 00:32:07,716
She is really good in bed.

312
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:17,059
- So who is this bitch?
- Her name is Paloma Faith.

313
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:21,855
- And what does she do?
- The most obscene job in the world.

314
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:24,107
She is a prostitute?

315
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:26,485
Worse. She is a pop star.

316
00:32:27,236 --> 00:32:29,071
Pop star...

317
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:32,240
What was that the Julian said about her?

318
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:34,993
I've already told you.

319
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:38,455
No you didn't. All you did was you babbled
incomprehensibly. You didn't tell me.

320
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:41,708
No. It was Julian who did bubbling.
He was not right in the head.

321
00:32:42,835 --> 00:32:44,878
Doesn't seem that way to me!

322
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:47,631
He must've made twenty decisions
in two hours ...

323
00:32:49,008 --> 00:32:51,969
He moved out,
He found an apartment ...

324
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:54,638
... He spoke on the phone
with a divorce lawyer.

325
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:57,599
It does not really seem
like a confused man to me.

326
00:32:57,767 --> 00:33:00,644
You keep on saying to me that
this woman is ugly and insignificant.

327
00:33:00,853 --> 00:33:04,523
So what is it
that Julian sees in her that...

328
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:06,650
He didn't see in me?

329
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:09,653
Now. How should I know?

330
00:33:09,737 --> 00:33:12,489
Because you said that Mick
asked him!

331
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:16,284
- Did I?
- Yes. Yes, that's what you said.

332
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:19,913
- So I wanna know what was Julians response.
- I don't remember.

333
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:23,041
Oh God,
You're really pissing me of now, Daddy.

334
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:26,628
You remember perfectly well
you are a horrible liar.

335
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:28,296
I swear...

336
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:31,299
He was just mumbling some idiocy.

337
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:36,888
If you don't tell me I swear I am
going to scream right here and now.

338
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,641
I want to know what he said.

339
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:45,439
What the fuck does this bitch have,
at least according to Julian, that I don't?

340
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:47,816
I want to know.
I want to know what he said!

341
00:33:49,902 --> 00:33:51,653
He said...

342
00:33:51,946 --> 00:33:53,655
Yes...

343
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:58,452
She was good in bed.

344
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:12,049
You didn't have to tell me that.

345
00:35:07,855 --> 00:35:09,648
Believe me, Lena.

346
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:12,776
I can understand you.

347
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:16,613
Really, I can.

348
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:23,745
You can understand me?

349
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:26,540
Like hell you can!

350
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:30,293
Mommy would've been able
to understand me.

351
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:33,630
Mommy found herself in the same situation ...

352
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:37,801
... I'm in now with you not once,
but dozens of times ...

353
00:35:37,885 --> 00:35:39,928
She was pretending not to know.

354
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:44,808
You had a stream of women,
but she just kept going ...

355
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:48,937
... Not just for us children,
but above all for you.

356
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:51,690
She loved you
and so she forgave you.

357
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:55,569
No matter what happened,
she still wanted to be with you.

358
00:35:57,321 --> 00:36:00,657
But who were you? Who?

359
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:05,036
It's what I've always asked myself.

360
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:09,958
You never gave anything ...
not to her, not to me, nothing.

361
00:36:10,793 --> 00:36:15,088
You gave everything to your music.
Music, music, music!

362
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:19,426
There was nothing else in your life.
Only music and arrogance.

363
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:23,722
Never a caress, never a hug,
never a kiss, nothing.

364
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:27,726
You never knew anything
about your children.

365
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:31,479
You never knew if we were happy,
if we were suffering. Nothing.

366
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:35,442
Everything was on Mommy's shoulders.

367
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:40,113
At home the only thing you would say
to her were the two words: "Quiet, Melanie."

368
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:43,491
And Mom would explain to us:
"Quiet, Daddy is composing".

369
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:46,203
"Quiet, Daddy is resting,
he has a concert tonight. "

370
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:48,371
"Quiet, Daddy is on the phone
with someone important. "

371
00:36:48,497 --> 00:36:52,375
"Quiet, Daddy has Stravinsky
coming to the house later tonight".

372
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:56,379
He wanted to be a Stravinsky, but
he never had a single drop of his genius.

373
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:58,506
"Quiet, Melanie!"

374
00:36:58,591 --> 00:37:01,134
Were the only two things
you knew how to say.

375
00:37:01,844 --> 00:37:03,970
You didn't know the first thing
about my mother!

376
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:06,389
You never bothered to
take care of her.

377
00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:10,644
And even now, you haven't brought
her flowers for ten years.

378
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,647
And that letter!

379
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:18,360
Do you think Mommy
never read it? Well, you're wrong.

380
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:21,154
She found it and she read it
and I've read it too.

381
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:23,990
But you probably don't even
remember that letter. But we do.

382
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:28,036
The letter we found in which you
professed your love for another man.

383
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:31,289
Mommy had to enjoy
that humiliation too.

384
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:35,794
"My necessary experimentation
in sexual matters" as you put it.

385
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,796
So your musical experimentation
wasn't enough for you.

386
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:40,799
No! You had to experiment
in homosexuality too!

387
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:45,011
You didn't give a fuck about
all the anguish you've caused her.

388
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:47,305
So don't you come telling me
that you can understand ...

389
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:50,517
Because you don't understand
a fucking thing.

390
00:39:39,668 --> 00:39:42,128
Gracias.

391
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:09,406
Stop telling me what to do!
If I want to bite my nail, I will!

392
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:43,750
This morning I did this
big, powerful piss.

393
00:41:44,293 --> 00:41:47,420
I was so happy!
I haven't been so happy in a long time.

394
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:50,048
Good. I am happy for you.

395
00:41:50,257 --> 00:41:52,509
No, it's only a joke, Mick. I mean it ...

396
00:41:52,551 --> 00:41:54,761
You know, it wasn't like that...

397
00:41:54,803 --> 00:41:58,806
You do not joke about these things, Fred.
The prostate is serious.

398
00:41:58,891 --> 00:42:01,309
You are always fall for my jokes, Mick.

399
00:42:01,393 --> 00:42:06,314
You've been believing
my every word for sixty years.

400
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:08,816
I invent stories, Fred.

401
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:12,445
I have to believe in everything
in order to make things up.

402
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:30,964
Do you remember the other day?

403
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:33,925
When you told me you don't remember
your parents any more?

404
00:42:34,176 --> 00:42:35,301
No, I don't remember.

405
00:42:35,344 --> 00:42:36,970
Of course you do.

406
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:41,474
You made me realize that not only
I do not remember my parents any more ...

407
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:46,229
... But my childhood, for example,
I do not remember a thing about it.

408
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:50,733
- There is only one thing I still remember.
- What?

409
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:55,822
The precise moment when I
learned how to ride a bike.

410
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:58,199
And this morning ...

411
00:42:58,325 --> 00:43:00,243
As if by magic ...

412
00:43:02,496 --> 00:43:04,998
I remembered the moment right after ...

413
00:43:05,124 --> 00:43:07,083
When you fell off?

414
00:43:09,878 --> 00:43:13,756
- How the fuck did you know?
- Well, that happens to everybody.

415
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:17,760
You learn something, you're happy
and then ... you forget to brake.

416
00:44:22,284 --> 00:44:25,578
- How is the work on the role going?
- Pretty well.

417
00:44:25,704 --> 00:44:30,333
- Actually, I've come up with some
interesting details. - Fine.

418
00:44:30,459 --> 00:44:34,337
Maybe the problem is that Julian and I
never had children.

419
00:44:34,963 --> 00:44:36,798
I don't know what the problem is ...

420
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:39,967
But I'm not going to try and
cheer you up by lying...

421
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:42,095
Or talk about things
I never knew about.

422
00:44:43,472 --> 00:44:45,306
You were right...

423
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:47,684
Music is all I understand.

424
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:48,976
Did you know why?

425
00:44:49,228 --> 00:44:53,481
Because you don't need words,
only experience to understand it.

426
00:44:53,732 --> 00:44:55,608
It just is.

427
00:44:57,236 --> 00:44:59,612
Your mother would've
understood you.

428
00:45:00,322 --> 00:45:02,240
I can't.

429
00:45:02,324 --> 00:45:04,701
But your mother is not here.

430
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:05,613
What happened?

431
00:47:13,747 --> 00:47:16,249
Daddy, I have to tell you something.
It's ...

432
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:19,585
... Personal.

433
00:47:20,712 --> 00:47:22,255
Tell me, Lena.

434
00:47:25,384 --> 00:47:27,343
Julian is an ass. Because ...

435
00:47:30,722 --> 00:47:32,974
... I'm really good in bed.

436
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:35,268
I know.

437
00:47:37,771 --> 00:47:39,480
What do you mean "you know"?

438
00:47:39,773 --> 00:47:41,774
You're my daughter.

439
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:44,402
And, in all modesty ...

440
00:47:44,486 --> 00:47:47,113
I was a wonder between the sheets.

441
00:47:48,782 --> 00:47:50,533
It's true!

442
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:29,822
- Do you know who composed the piece
that you are practising? - No, who?

443
00:48:29,948 --> 00:48:32,700
- Me.
- I don't believe you.

444
00:48:33,201 --> 00:48:34,201
What's it called?

445
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:37,663
- "Simple Song number 3"
- And what's the composers name?

446
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:40,082
Fred Ballinger.

447
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:46,088
- And you? What's your name?
- Fred Ballinger.

448
00:48:47,049 --> 00:48:49,675
You can check at the front desk.
I am staying here.

449
00:48:50,302 --> 00:48:52,845
- Incredible!
- Yeah, it's incredible.

450
00:48:53,221 --> 00:48:55,556
My teacher makes me play it.

451
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:58,476
He says it's a perfect piece
to start with.

452
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:02,980
- Yes, well he is right. It is very simple.
- It's not only simple.

453
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:06,609
- Oh really?
- It's also really beautiful.

454
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:10,571
Yes, it is beautiful.

455
00:49:11,073 --> 00:49:13,866
I composed it while I still loved.

456
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:26,712
May I do something while you
still playing? Keep playing.

457
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:33,970
There.

458
00:49:37,849 --> 00:49:40,226
Daddy, where you been?

459
00:49:40,394 --> 00:49:42,269
This man has been here
for over an hour.

460
00:49:42,521 --> 00:49:45,523
- He says he is the Queen emissary.
- Shit!

461
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:48,734
I told him to make himself
comfortable in our room.

462
00:49:49,403 --> 00:49:51,153
Be nice!

463
00:49:52,155 --> 00:49:55,408
I was just wondering ...
If we could maybe ...

464
00:49:55,909 --> 00:49:59,120
- Head out on the terrace?
- No, it's too cold.

465
00:49:59,538 --> 00:50:01,872
But you can smoke those in here,
if you like.

466
00:50:02,165 --> 00:50:04,291
- Are you serious?
- Yes, yes.

467
00:50:04,376 --> 00:50:06,293
The hotel manager
is a music lover.

468
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:08,546
And I get a very little privileges.

469
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:10,881
You have no idea...

470
00:50:11,425 --> 00:50:13,551
The most pleasure this gives me.

471
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:17,763
- Are you feeling tense?
- Awful.

472
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:23,561
There you go!

473
00:50:23,645 --> 00:50:27,189
We don't have much time
so I'll skip the formalities.

474
00:50:27,399 --> 00:50:31,694
But I'm having the thorough cleansing
of my intestines.

475
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:34,071
Bloody hell!

476
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:39,201
Right, I was unable
to convince the queen.

477
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:42,038
I relayed your reticence
about the "Songs" to her.

478
00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:44,957
I proposed
an alternative repertoire.

479
00:50:45,042 --> 00:50:47,835
An alternative musician,
an alternative evening.

480
00:50:47,961 --> 00:50:49,545
She does not want alternatives.

481
00:50:49,588 --> 00:50:51,797
She want you and only you and
only your "Simple Songs".

482
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:54,216
She says it's all  that
Prince Philip listens to.

483
00:50:54,342 --> 00:50:58,095
Well, I don't want to be rude
but it's impossible.

484
00:50:59,431 --> 00:51:01,223
- Why?
- I told you.

485
00:51:01,349 --> 00:51:04,351
Last time we met ...
personal reasons.

486
00:51:05,979 --> 00:51:09,106
Is there no way to resolve
these "personal reasons"?

487
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:11,484
Unfortunately, no.

488
00:51:13,445 --> 00:51:15,571
I am begging you, Maestro.

489
00:51:15,614 --> 00:51:19,617
I have a difficult job.  I simply have to
return to London with a positive answer.

490
00:51:19,868 --> 00:51:22,995
And my answer is ... negative.

491
00:51:24,372 --> 00:51:28,751
I don't understand...
What exactly doesn't work?

492
00:51:28,835 --> 00:51:30,503
Is it the date?

493
00:51:30,587 --> 00:51:34,256
Is it the location? Is it the orchestra?
Is it the soprano? Is it the Queen?

494
00:51:34,382 --> 00:51:38,761
Please don't insist.
Personal reasons.

495
00:51:38,887 --> 00:51:42,348
But what are these bloody
"personal reasons"?

496
00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:45,893
"Personal" means
I am not obliged to answer.

497
00:51:46,394 --> 00:51:49,772
Let's see if we can resolve
these personal problems. I mean ...

498
00:51:49,856 --> 00:51:52,108
What is it that's wrong?

499
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,527
The soprano.

500
00:51:55,737 --> 00:51:59,657
- We'll get a different one then. Not a problem...
- It wouldn't make any difference.

501
00:51:59,741 --> 00:52:01,784
What, even Sumi Jo?
She is absolute best.

502
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:06,997
I mean, she already expressed her enthusiasm
as to being directed by you! She's ecstatic!

503
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:09,500
I am not interested.

504
00:52:10,127 --> 00:52:11,669
What is it you have against her?

505
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:13,754
Nothing! I've never even met her.

506
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:17,508
- You've never even met her? So what ...
- That's enough!

507
00:52:26,393 --> 00:52:28,269
I'm sorry...

508
00:52:28,562 --> 00:52:32,314
I just do not understand.
What exactly is the problem?

509
00:52:32,524 --> 00:52:36,443
The problem is that I composed
the "Simple Songs" for my wife.

510
00:52:36,653 --> 00:52:39,071
And only she
has ever performed them.

511
00:52:39,447 --> 00:52:41,907
And only she
has recorded them.

512
00:52:41,950 --> 00:52:46,078
And as long as I live,
she will be the only one to sing them.

513
00:52:46,663 --> 00:52:48,706
The problem is, dear sir ...

514
00:52:51,042 --> 00:52:54,545
... My wife can't sing any more.

515
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:04,597
Have you understand?

516
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:06,807
Do you?

517
00:53:07,976 --> 00:53:10,352
Yes, I do understand.

518
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:13,189
I beg you a pardon, Maestro.

519
00:53:21,198 --> 00:53:22,698
Lena?

520
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:26,702
Yes...?

521
00:53:27,454 --> 00:53:29,997
Stop crying.

522
00:53:30,749 --> 00:53:32,499
Please.

523
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:35,628
OK.

524
00:54:12,290 --> 00:54:15,542
I'm going to give you
a different type of massage.

525
00:54:16,419 --> 00:54:18,295
Because you are stressed.

526
00:54:19,798 --> 00:54:21,882
No, to be precise ...

527
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:23,884
You are not stressed.

528
00:54:24,177 --> 00:54:26,303
You are emotional.

529
00:54:27,013 --> 00:54:29,890
You understand everything
with your hands, don't you?

530
00:54:30,308 --> 00:54:33,686
We can understand all sorts of things
by touching.

531
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:39,525
Who knows why people
are so afraid of touching?

532
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:46,573
Maybe it's because they think it has
something to do with pleasure.

533
00:54:50,328 --> 00:54:53,664
That's just another good reason
for touching instead of talking.

534
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:59,586
Don't you like to talk?

535
00:55:03,466 --> 00:55:05,676
I never have anything to say.

536
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:25,487
Come, look.

537
00:55:29,117 --> 00:55:32,244
Now, listen.
Do you see that mountain over there?

538
00:55:33,496 --> 00:55:37,374
- Yes. It looks very close.
- Exactly.

539
00:55:37,459 --> 00:55:39,710
This is what you see
when you're young.

540
00:55:40,128 --> 00:55:42,379
Everything seems really close.

541
00:55:42,756 --> 00:55:44,256
And that's the future.

542
00:55:44,966 --> 00:55:46,842
And now...

543
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:55,017
And that's what you see
when you're old.

544
00:55:55,101 --> 00:55:57,895
Everything seems really far away.

545
00:55:58,229 --> 00:56:00,147
That's the past.

546
00:56:12,035 --> 00:56:13,035
Brenda ...

547
00:56:13,411 --> 00:56:14,787
Can't wait to get started.

548
00:56:15,163 --> 00:56:19,666
And I am so proud of having
written this screenplay with you.

549
00:56:19,793 --> 00:56:22,044
I made twenty films,
but they all irrelevant.

550
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:23,796
This is the only film ...

551
00:56:24,047 --> 00:56:26,173
That means anything to me.

552
00:56:26,299 --> 00:56:30,636
It's my sentimental, intellectual
and moral testament.

553
00:56:30,678 --> 00:56:33,180
So, let's toast to the completion
of the third draft ...

554
00:56:33,431 --> 00:56:35,557
Of ... "Life's last day."

555
00:56:35,683 --> 00:56:37,643
What about the ending, Mick?

556
00:56:38,686 --> 00:56:40,437
The ending?

557
00:56:40,814 --> 00:56:42,940
We'll come up with one sooner or later.

558
00:56:43,691 --> 00:56:45,818
Cheers!

559
00:56:51,699 --> 00:56:54,827
- Hello, Fred Ballinger.
- Hi.

560
00:56:55,453 --> 00:56:58,080
I wanted to tell you that
I checked at the front desk ...

561
00:56:58,164 --> 00:57:00,666
- And you're really Fred Ballinger.
- Good.

562
00:57:00,708 --> 00:57:03,669
I am glad to see you've put
your mind at rest on that score.

563
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:06,213
There is something else
I wanted to tell you too.

564
00:57:06,464 --> 00:57:08,549
You go right ahead.

565
00:57:08,716 --> 00:57:12,428
I wanted to tell you that ever since you have
corrected the position of my elbow ...

566
00:57:13,096 --> 00:57:15,973
... I play better,
the sounds comes more natural.

567
00:57:16,057 --> 00:57:18,434
Good! You know why?

568
00:57:19,102 --> 00:57:21,103
Because you're left-handed.

569
00:57:21,354 --> 00:57:24,356
And all left-handed people
are irregular.

570
00:57:25,483 --> 00:57:29,445
- So an irregular position helps.
- I'm sorry.

571
00:57:31,614 --> 00:57:35,367
I am left-handed too.

572
00:57:39,873 --> 00:57:43,709
Christ! The whole world knows
you are left-handed.

573
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:50,716
Thank you.

574
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:48,148
I am Luca.

575
00:58:49,776 --> 00:58:51,818
Luca Moroder.

576
00:58:53,571 --> 00:58:55,447
Hello.

577
00:58:56,032 --> 00:58:57,574
I am a mountaineer.

578
00:58:58,701 --> 00:59:00,077
And I teach climbing.

579
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:04,289
- I give lessons here at the hotel.
- Oh ... - And you?

580
00:59:05,708 --> 00:59:07,709
What do you do?

581
00:59:08,169 --> 00:59:09,795
I have two jobs.

582
00:59:09,963 --> 00:59:14,550
I'm a daughter and I also
an assistant to my father.

583
00:59:16,344 --> 00:59:19,179
- Two jobs ...
- Yeah...

584
00:59:26,354 --> 00:59:28,981
This is a Forerunner 620.

585
00:59:30,108 --> 00:59:32,734
It has a colour touch display.

586
00:59:32,986 --> 00:59:35,487
It can estimate
VO2max ...

587
00:59:35,613 --> 00:59:40,117
... The  maximum rate of oxygen consumption
during maximum excursion.

588
00:59:40,201 --> 00:59:42,828
I would like to give one to my cousin
for a Christmas.

589
00:59:43,371 --> 00:59:45,622
We always go climbing together.

590
00:59:47,375 --> 00:59:48,959
He was supposed to be here too ...

591
00:59:49,002 --> 00:59:51,962
But he slipped in the bathtub
and broke his femur.

592
00:59:53,006 --> 00:59:56,258
Bathtubs are more
dangerous than Everest.

593
00:59:57,135 --> 00:59:59,094
How true!

594
00:59:59,762 --> 01:00:03,640
Do you know what I found once
on the K2 summit?

595
01:00:06,352 --> 01:00:07,978
No. What?

596
01:00:09,731 --> 01:00:11,857
A bedside table.

597
01:00:12,984 --> 01:00:15,527
- That's not true.
- Yes it is.

598
01:00:16,154 --> 01:00:18,155
I opened the drawer.

599
01:00:19,532 --> 01:00:21,742
But it was empty.

600
01:00:24,412 --> 01:00:27,998
It is an amazing feeling -
climbing, you know?

601
01:00:29,542 --> 01:00:31,543
A real sense of freedom.

602
01:00:31,794 --> 01:00:33,920
All I feel is fear.

603
01:00:36,424 --> 01:00:39,301
That is an amazing feeling too,
you know?

604
01:00:42,013 --> 01:00:46,058
So who is the most talented actress
you've ever worked with, Mr. Boyle?

605
01:00:46,184 --> 01:00:49,770
Brenda Morel,
without a doubt. A genius!

606
01:00:50,438 --> 01:00:52,814
She couldn't have read more
than two books in her life ...

607
01:00:53,191 --> 01:00:55,442
And one of them was
an autobiography ...

608
01:00:55,526 --> 01:00:57,527
... Written by a ghost writer, naturally.

609
01:00:57,820 --> 01:01:00,822
- A genius, in what sense?
- If you know how to steal ...

610
01:01:00,948 --> 01:01:04,951
... You do not need training.
Stealing becomes your education.

611
01:01:05,078 --> 01:01:06,828
That's how Brenda is.

612
01:01:06,913 --> 01:01:09,081
Even when, thanks to my films,
she became a diva ...

613
01:01:09,290 --> 01:01:11,416
... She never forgotten
where she was from.

614
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:13,585
The street was her real home.

615
01:01:13,961 --> 01:01:16,088
And that's where she stayed, stealing ...

616
01:01:16,589 --> 01:01:18,298
Everything.

617
01:01:18,549 --> 01:01:21,593
Which is how she created such
unforgettable characters.

618
01:01:22,178 --> 01:01:23,845
And won two Oscars.

619
01:02:27,869 --> 01:02:30,495
Climb on my shoulders.

620
01:02:40,173 --> 01:02:42,132
Okay.

621
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:44,426
Now, as we climb ...

622
01:02:45,511 --> 01:02:47,554
Look down.

623
01:02:48,556 --> 01:02:51,808
See how beautiful
the world is from up here.

624
01:02:58,816 --> 01:03:01,193
So the French called again.

625
01:03:01,569 --> 01:03:05,197
They really want to do that book
with you, your memoirs.

626
01:03:05,323 --> 01:03:07,949
But they want the whole picture:
they want your Life, your work...

627
01:03:08,701 --> 01:03:11,536
- What should I say?
- Tell them ...

628
01:03:16,417 --> 01:03:18,335
Tell them what?

629
01:03:20,087 --> 01:03:22,464
To forget me!

630
01:03:23,090 --> 01:03:27,594
Tell them that I'm retired.
I'm done ...

631
01:03:28,221 --> 01:03:32,974
- ... with work and with life.
- Cut the crap!

632
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:36,102
Your music convene ...

633
01:03:36,229 --> 01:03:38,730
... Surprising new emotions.

634
01:03:39,232 --> 01:03:41,858
Emotions can be overrated too, Mick.

635
01:03:45,738 --> 01:03:49,741
These shows are really pathetic.
All that's missing is a mime.

636
01:03:50,368 --> 01:03:54,246
- We usually get one of those
by the end of the season as well. - Good.

637
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:11,763
Excuse me Mr. Tree,
Miss Universe is here.

638
01:04:19,272 --> 01:04:22,023
It's such a pleasure to meet you.

639
01:04:22,358 --> 01:04:24,776
I am huge fan of yours.

640
01:04:24,902 --> 01:04:27,737
I mean, I'm literally went crazy
when you played "Mr. Q".

641
01:04:28,030 --> 01:04:32,617
I never miss robot movies.
But that one is - my favourite.

642
01:04:32,910 --> 01:04:34,411
Thank you.

643
01:04:34,912 --> 01:04:39,541
Do you ever watch any kinds of films
other than robot movies?

644
01:04:40,418 --> 01:04:41,918
Of course!

645
01:04:42,044 --> 01:04:45,422
I've got my whole life ahead of me
and I want to be an actress.

646
01:04:45,548 --> 01:04:49,885
I don't want to just rely
on my beauty.

647
01:04:51,053 --> 01:04:55,432
Well, do you study?
Or you just watch reality TV?

648
01:05:02,189 --> 01:05:03,815
I appreciate the irony ...

649
01:05:04,442 --> 01:05:07,777
... But when it is deranged and poisoned
it is a train of its force ...

650
01:05:10,281 --> 01:05:12,324
... And it reveals something else.

651
01:05:13,826 --> 01:05:15,535
What?

652
01:05:16,078 --> 01:05:18,288
Frustration.

653
01:05:19,165 --> 01:05:21,833
I am frustrated, Miss Universe?

654
01:05:21,918 --> 01:05:24,961
I am happy I took part
in "Miss Universe" pageant.

655
01:05:25,171 --> 01:05:28,340
Are you happy you've played "Mister Q"?

656
01:05:45,733 --> 01:05:49,444
She is not at all stupid,
Miss Universe.

657
01:05:49,612 --> 01:05:51,488
Not at all!

658
01:06:47,294 --> 01:06:49,295
I saw you in a film once.

659
01:06:51,173 --> 01:06:53,883
So you like "Mister Q" as well?

660
01:06:55,177 --> 01:06:56,761
No.

661
01:06:56,929 --> 01:07:00,807
I saw you in that film that you've
played a father who never knew his son.

662
01:07:00,891 --> 01:07:04,769
And he meets him for the first time in a highway
diner when his son is already 14 years.

663
01:07:05,813 --> 01:07:08,440
Nobody saw that movie!

664
01:07:08,941 --> 01:07:11,651
There was that dialogue that I really liked.

665
01:07:11,694 --> 01:07:15,280
When your son says:
"Why weren't you a father to me?"

666
01:07:15,322 --> 01:07:17,157
And you say:

667
01:07:17,199 --> 01:07:19,701
"I didn't think I was up to it."

668
01:07:19,910 --> 01:07:23,038
At that moment I understood
some really important.

669
01:07:24,331 --> 01:07:25,415
What?

670
01:07:25,583 --> 01:07:28,334
That no one in the world
feels up to it.

671
01:07:28,461 --> 01:07:31,671
So there is no reason
to worry.

672
01:07:31,839 --> 01:07:34,299
Bye. See you at the hotel.

673
01:07:40,848 --> 01:07:45,560
- What do you do all day, Fred?
- They tell me that I am apathetic.

674
01:07:45,603 --> 01:07:47,479
So, I don't do anything.

675
01:07:48,481 --> 01:07:49,939
Don't you miss your work?

676
01:07:50,232 --> 01:07:52,108
Not at all.

677
01:07:52,359 --> 01:07:54,486
I worked far too much anyway.

678
01:07:55,237 --> 01:07:59,074
- So what do you miss?
- I miss my wife.

679
01:07:59,116 --> 01:08:01,076
My wife Melanie.

680
01:08:04,830 --> 01:08:07,123
I read on Wikipedia ...

681
01:08:07,249 --> 01:08:09,501
... That you hanged out with Stravinsky ...

682
01:08:09,585 --> 01:08:12,337
- For a while when you were young.
- Yes, I did.

683
01:08:12,379 --> 01:08:14,214
What was he like?

684
01:08:14,256 --> 01:08:17,592
He was very ... classy ....

685
01:08:19,261 --> 01:08:21,262
Classy? That's all?

686
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:25,850
Be generous with me, Fred.
I need a generous friend.

687
01:08:25,893 --> 01:08:28,603
Tell me about Stravinsky.

688
01:08:28,771 --> 01:08:30,730
He once said that

689
01:08:30,773 --> 01:08:33,900
"Intellectuals have no taste."

690
01:08:34,401 --> 01:08:37,028
From that moment on I did
everything I could ...

691
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:40,281
... not to become an intellectual.

692
01:08:40,783 --> 01:08:42,909
And I succeeded.

693
01:08:45,037 --> 01:08:47,372
And you? What do you miss?

694
01:08:48,916 --> 01:08:51,501
Nothing ...
It's very luckily.

695
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:56,297
Come on
Be generous with me, Jimmy.

696
01:08:58,050 --> 01:09:00,760
What I miss I discovered ...

697
01:09:00,803 --> 01:09:03,555
... Four months ago
while reading Novalis.

698
01:09:04,557 --> 01:09:06,683
You've read Novalis?

699
01:09:07,434 --> 01:09:09,644
Even the actors from California ...

700
01:09:09,687 --> 01:09:14,566
... When they're not getting drunk, selling
coke and hanging out with anorexic models ...

701
01:09:14,692 --> 01:09:16,776
... occasionally read Novalis.

702
01:09:17,319 --> 01:09:19,571
You're right. I'm sorry.

703
01:09:20,322 --> 01:09:23,658
I'm just an old man
with prejudices.

704
01:09:25,286 --> 01:09:27,579
And what does Novalis say?

705
01:09:29,832 --> 01:09:32,458
"I'm always going home."

706
01:09:33,043 --> 01:09:36,296
"Always going to my father's house."

707
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:26,763
What are you thinking about?

708
01:10:32,353 --> 01:10:34,354
The future.

709
01:11:46,927 --> 01:11:51,180
He is on his deathbed
and murmurs to her:

710
01:11:51,849 --> 01:11:53,850
"I should've devoted myself to you ..."

711
01:11:54,351 --> 01:11:56,352
"..and to Our Love ..."

712
01:11:56,478 --> 01:12:02,233
"..instead of wasting my life trying to
become the king of the insurance policies. "

713
01:12:06,739 --> 01:12:09,449
Maybe he says something banal to her:

714
01:12:10,075 --> 01:12:11,993
Real simple. Like:

715
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:14,746
"Take care of yourself."

716
01:12:16,457 --> 01:12:23,129
No, we have to stay with
the physical pain right until the end.

717
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:26,507
How about he says:

718
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:31,262
"Not even morphine
can help me now. "

719
01:12:33,015 --> 01:12:37,226
What if he focuses on some
insignificant detail?

720
01:12:37,895 --> 01:12:40,229
If he said something like:

721
01:12:40,981 --> 01:12:45,985
"I wonder whatever happened to that
key ring you gave me 25 years ago! "

722
01:12:46,111 --> 01:12:48,654
"The one that the shaped
Like a horseshoe."

723
01:12:50,407 --> 01:12:56,871
No. He, doesn't say anything
on his deathbed.

724
01:13:00,626 --> 01:13:02,752
She's the one who talks.

725
01:13:04,171 --> 01:13:05,922
Brenda.

726
01:13:07,674 --> 01:13:09,675
She says:

727
01:13:10,928 --> 01:13:14,806
"I lost so much time
because of you, Michael. "

728
01:13:16,809 --> 01:13:20,812
"I lost the best years
of my life."

729
01:15:22,434 --> 01:15:24,310
Good morning.

730
01:15:25,062 --> 01:15:27,939
I have never told you
how sorry I am about...

731
01:15:28,065 --> 01:15:30,441
... How things ended
between you and Julian.

732
01:15:32,152 --> 01:15:34,695
I mean, I want to apologize
for his behaviour.

733
01:15:34,780 --> 01:15:37,156
You don't have to apologize,
It's not your fault.

734
01:15:41,161 --> 01:15:42,954
Let's face it.

735
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:46,290
As a father, I could've done more.

736
01:15:46,333 --> 01:15:49,335
Let's face it, Julian
picked up the scent.

737
01:15:50,087 --> 01:15:52,421
I've started to smell that too.

738
01:15:54,591 --> 01:15:58,094
- What scent?
- Scent of freedom.

739
01:15:58,220 --> 01:16:01,931
Oh, right. I know this scent.

740
01:16:03,100 --> 01:16:07,061
Daddy didn't really say anything
to you about the Queen?

741
01:16:07,604 --> 01:16:12,441
About how she has asked him to conduct
the "Simple Songs" in London and how he said "No"?

742
01:16:12,484 --> 01:16:16,612
- He didn't tell me a thing.
- Gosh, you guys have got a strange friendship.

743
01:16:17,322 --> 01:16:20,700
Strange? No, it's not strange.
It's a good friendship.

744
01:16:21,201 --> 01:16:24,954
And in a good friendships
you only tell each other the good things.

745
01:16:25,122 --> 01:16:28,249
He must've thought the Queen's
concert wasn't one of them.

746
01:16:28,333 --> 01:16:32,003
You know, he said the reason he can't
conduct the "Simple Songs" ...

747
01:16:32,129 --> 01:16:35,590
... Was because my Mother was the only
on Earth who could sing them.

748
01:16:35,632 --> 01:16:40,386
- He said that? - He said that to the
Queen's emissary.

749
01:16:42,639 --> 01:16:45,266
It took him eighty years
to finally say something romantic ...

750
01:16:45,517 --> 01:16:48,519
And he goes and says that
to the Queen's emissary.

751
01:16:53,609 --> 01:16:57,403
Sometimes when I sleep at night
he watches me.

752
01:16:57,487 --> 01:17:01,657
And last night, he stroke my cheek
for the first time in my life.

753
01:17:02,117 --> 01:17:04,910
Only I wasn't asleep,
I was pretending to be asleep.

754
01:17:08,498 --> 01:17:13,669
Parents know when their children
are pretending to be asleep.

755
01:17:17,799 --> 01:17:20,801
It's years, since you went
to see Melanie.

756
01:17:21,136 --> 01:17:22,637
Why don't you go?

757
01:17:23,013 --> 01:17:25,431
Venice is so close.

758
01:17:27,267 --> 01:17:29,435
Don't you agree?

759
01:17:30,145 --> 01:17:35,066
- There is something that is keeps
getting into my head. - What?

760
01:17:36,068 --> 01:17:41,197
What it would've been like
to have slept with Gilda Black!

761
01:17:43,700 --> 01:17:48,329
Yeah! I wonder too.

762
01:17:53,043 --> 01:17:54,960
Liar!

763
01:18:17,693 --> 01:18:20,569
You know what's the difference
between you and me?

764
01:18:21,446 --> 01:18:23,364
What.

765
01:18:23,990 --> 01:18:25,991
Ultimately ...

766
01:18:26,243 --> 01:18:29,620
... I never liked life
well enough.

767
01:18:48,515 --> 01:18:53,144
Brenda wanted to play
Eva Braun a hundred years ago.

768
01:18:53,770 --> 01:18:55,604
She spent six months
working on her role.

769
01:18:55,647 --> 01:18:59,400
I have been studying all the
hotel guests for a weeks now.

770
01:18:59,776 --> 01:19:04,280
I've been meticulously observing
you, Fred, Lena ...

771
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:08,492
The Russians, the Arabs,
the young and the old.

772
01:19:08,744 --> 01:19:11,620
And I have finally come
to a conclusion ...

773
01:19:13,123 --> 01:19:15,791
... I have to choose.

774
01:19:15,917 --> 01:19:18,919
I have to choose what is really
worth telling.

775
01:19:19,171 --> 01:19:21,630
The Horror or Desire?

776
01:19:22,424 --> 01:19:24,675
And I chose the Desire.

777
01:19:25,635 --> 01:19:28,512
You, each one of you ...

778
01:19:30,432 --> 01:19:32,391
... You opened my eyes.

779
01:19:32,434 --> 01:19:38,564
You made me see that I should not be wasting
my time on the senselessness of Horror.

780
01:19:39,566 --> 01:19:43,068
It came to this,
I can't play Hitler.

781
01:19:43,195 --> 01:19:46,447
I want to tell about your Desire,
my Desire.

782
01:19:46,531 --> 01:19:49,450
So pure, so impossible,
so immoral ...

783
01:19:49,534 --> 01:19:52,703
... But it doesn't matter
because that's what makes us alive.

784
01:22:03,543 --> 01:22:05,085
Who is she?

785
01:22:05,170 --> 01:22:06,921
God!

786
01:22:07,797 --> 01:22:10,049
What do you mean
"Who is she"?

787
01:22:11,092 --> 01:22:13,218
Miss Universe.

788
01:22:14,054 --> 01:22:17,056
But she looks all different.

789
01:22:18,183 --> 01:22:20,309
Unrecognisable.

790
01:22:21,853 --> 01:22:23,812
She's been transformed.

791
01:22:23,939 --> 01:22:26,857
From watching all those
robot movies.

792
01:22:27,442 --> 01:22:30,069
Excuse me, Mr. Boyle.

793
01:22:30,820 --> 01:22:32,988
There is someone here
to see you.

794
01:22:34,741 --> 01:22:37,743
Can't you see we are enjoying ...

795
01:22:37,869 --> 01:22:41,205
... The last great idillia
of our lives?

796
01:22:42,749 --> 01:22:45,000
Well, who was
the pretender there?

797
01:22:45,961 --> 01:22:47,753
Brenda Morel.

798
01:22:49,464 --> 01:22:51,256
Brenda Morel?

799
01:22:52,008 --> 01:22:53,759
Here?

800
01:23:04,396 --> 01:23:08,273
What the hell is this?
It looks like an accident.

801
01:23:09,526 --> 01:23:11,276
It's called "Alpine prison".

802
01:23:11,861 --> 01:23:13,487
By a local artist.

803
01:23:14,364 --> 01:23:19,493
- Human beings really know how to be
pathetic when try to, don't they? - Yes.

804
01:23:23,039 --> 01:23:25,040
Brenda!

805
01:23:25,375 --> 01:23:29,920
What a fabulous, marvellous
surprise!

806
01:23:30,922 --> 01:23:32,881
Hi, Mick.

807
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:39,680
You look fabulous, Brenda.

808
01:23:40,140 --> 01:23:42,808
The very picture of radiance
has the sex appeal.

809
01:23:42,934 --> 01:23:47,187
You're getting mixed up with the
last millennium, Mick.

810
01:23:48,690 --> 01:23:51,567
What? You're not going to
just wait any longer?

811
01:23:51,651 --> 01:23:53,819
We just finished
the latest version, you know?

812
01:23:53,903 --> 01:23:56,196
We were having trouble
with the last scene ...

813
01:23:56,281 --> 01:24:00,325
But then, yesterday, eureka!
It came to us!

814
01:24:00,785 --> 01:24:03,662
So now that you are here in the flesh ...

815
01:24:03,830 --> 01:24:05,706
We can hand it to you.

816
01:24:05,832 --> 01:24:08,709
But didn't you tell to me
you're going to be in Los Angeles?

817
01:24:09,294 --> 01:24:12,337
What are you doing in Europe?
Brenda?

818
01:24:13,548 --> 01:24:16,341
How many years we've known each other, Mick?

819
01:24:17,552 --> 01:24:20,095
Jesus, you put me on the spot!

820
01:24:20,680 --> 01:24:23,307
- Let me count ...
- 53 years.

821
01:24:24,309 --> 01:24:28,353
- How many films have we done together?
- Nine, ten ... - Eleven.

822
01:24:30,190 --> 01:24:33,692
So after 53 years of friendship
and eleven films together ...

823
01:24:33,860 --> 01:24:37,446
... You don't think I am going to start
to bullshit you now, do you? You of all people...

824
01:24:37,614 --> 01:24:40,616
No, I don't ...
I wouldn't deserve that.

825
01:24:40,700 --> 01:24:42,993
That's right ... you don't deserve it.

826
01:24:43,495 --> 01:24:45,871
You deserve me to call
spade "a spade".

827
01:24:46,706 --> 01:24:50,626
Which is why I dragged
my ass here from L.A.

828
01:24:50,752 --> 01:24:54,004
- To talk to you in person.
- Look, Brenda ...

829
01:24:54,130 --> 01:24:59,009
If it's about the scene 21
Where you described as "ugly ..."

830
01:24:59,219 --> 01:25:01,095
"..feeble, pale shadow of your
former beauty "...

831
01:25:01,721 --> 01:25:05,474
...Please, realize that's just
a poetic license.

832
01:25:05,725 --> 01:25:08,268
I want you to be extraordinary.

833
01:25:09,229 --> 01:25:11,855
You still preserve intact ...

834
01:25:12,273 --> 01:25:14,149
And you have to...

835
01:25:14,275 --> 01:25:17,653
That mystery with that a look
you've had when you first became a diva.

836
01:25:17,737 --> 01:25:19,530
Stop licking my ass, Mick.

837
01:25:19,906 --> 01:25:22,533
It just breaks my balls even more.

838
01:25:23,535 --> 01:25:26,286
Especially, given what have I come to tell you.

839
01:25:26,621 --> 01:25:29,039
Why? What have you come to tell me?

840
01:25:32,127 --> 01:25:34,545
I'm not going to be in the movie, Mick.

841
01:25:39,676 --> 01:25:41,552
What?

842
01:25:41,803 --> 01:25:45,556
They offered me a TV series in
the Mexico with three-year contract.

843
01:25:45,932 --> 01:25:49,434
An alcoholic grandmother who suffered
a serious stroke.

844
01:25:50,186 --> 01:25:54,189
A character has got real balls,
but with the money ...

845
01:25:54,315 --> 01:25:57,276
... I can pay for Jack's
drug rehab ...

846
01:25:57,318 --> 01:26:00,070
... I can pay off the debts of my
idiotic future ex-husband ...

847
01:26:00,196 --> 01:26:03,574
And I'll still have enough money left over
to buy a house in Miami ...

848
01:26:03,700 --> 01:26:06,451
... Which is something
I wanted to do for 14 years.

849
01:26:06,911 --> 01:26:09,163
That's why I've come to tell you this.

850
01:26:15,837 --> 01:26:18,046
But this is cinema, Brenda!

851
01:26:18,423 --> 01:26:20,799
That's just television.
And television is shit.

852
01:26:20,842 --> 01:26:23,719
No, and television is the future, Mick ...

853
01:26:23,803 --> 01:26:26,972
In fact, to tell the truth, it's also the present.

854
01:26:30,476 --> 01:26:33,812
Look, let's be frank.

855
01:26:34,105 --> 01:26:37,316
Because nobody ever speaks frankly
in this fucking film world.

856
01:26:37,859 --> 01:26:39,610
You're going on eighty ...

857
01:26:39,694 --> 01:26:43,697
... And like most of your colleagues,
you're getting worse with age.

858
01:26:46,117 --> 01:26:51,246
You know... The last three films
you've done were shit, Mick.

859
01:26:51,331 --> 01:26:54,625
I'm telling you, according to me
and according to everybody ...

860
01:26:54,751 --> 01:26:58,212
- They were real shit!
- How dare you?

861
01:26:59,589 --> 01:27:02,007
How dare you?

862
01:27:05,136 --> 01:27:09,014
So you want to be frank? Do you?

863
01:27:09,766 --> 01:27:12,267
53 years ago, if it weren't for me ...

864
01:27:12,393 --> 01:27:15,229
... You'd still been crouching
under sub-producers desks.

865
01:27:15,271 --> 01:27:20,359
I pulled you out from under
those big fat producers underpants ...

866
01:27:20,401 --> 01:27:22,486
... I made you an actress.

867
01:27:26,407 --> 01:27:28,283
You little shit.

868
01:27:28,743 --> 01:27:32,913
I was just fine inside those
producers underpants.

869
01:27:33,539 --> 01:27:38,001
You know why?
Because I wanted to be there.

870
01:27:38,378 --> 01:27:42,798
I don't owe anybody anything.
I did it myself.

871
01:27:42,924 --> 01:27:45,050
- Really?
- I paid my dues.

872
01:27:45,134 --> 01:27:47,928
I've gotten into the Actor's Studio
and nobody pulled any strings for me.

873
01:27:48,054 --> 01:27:51,306
I supported myself washing
toilets all over Brooklyn.

874
01:27:51,432 --> 01:27:53,642
My mother went into debt for me.

875
01:27:54,936 --> 01:27:57,020
And in Hollywood ...

876
01:27:57,689 --> 01:28:01,149
... When I walked through
that front door ...

877
01:28:01,192 --> 01:28:03,902
... I was all by my fucking self.

878
01:28:03,945 --> 01:28:05,320
Marilyn ...

879
01:28:05,405 --> 01:28:08,949
... Rita, Grace they'd all shit their pants
when they saw me coming.

880
01:28:09,158 --> 01:28:12,703
It's all written down in my autobiography.
Don't tell me you haven't read it?

881
01:28:12,954 --> 01:28:17,332
Unfortunately I have.
Except you didn't write it.

882
01:28:18,334 --> 01:28:22,337
- And it's a piece of shit.
- The real shit is your film, Mick.

883
01:28:22,463 --> 01:28:25,465
I understand cinema, you know I do.

884
01:28:25,591 --> 01:28:27,551
You're the one who doesn't
understand it any more.

885
01:28:27,719 --> 01:28:30,554
Because you're old, you're tired ...

886
01:28:30,596 --> 01:28:32,723
You don't know how
to see the world any more, Mick.

887
01:28:33,057 --> 01:28:38,186
All you know how to see is your own death,
which is waiting right around the corner for you.

888
01:28:38,730 --> 01:28:40,731
Your career is over.

889
01:28:41,691 --> 01:28:44,109
I'm just telling you flat out
because I love you.

890
01:28:44,360 --> 01:28:47,863
Nobody is interested
in this ...

891
01:28:47,989 --> 01:28:50,365
"Testament" of yours?
Is that what you call it? A "Testament"?

892
01:28:50,992 --> 01:28:53,618
And you'll risk nullyfiyng all the
beautiful films you have ever done.

893
01:28:53,870 --> 01:28:56,121
Which is unforgivable, Mick.

894
01:28:57,206 --> 01:28:59,750
It's only because of me
they letting you do this movie.

895
01:29:00,877 --> 01:29:03,503
So, If I pull out,
I'm saving your life ...

896
01:29:04,505 --> 01:29:06,715
And your dignity!

897
01:29:08,634 --> 01:29:10,719
You are ingrate.

898
01:29:12,764 --> 01:29:15,223
An ingrate and an idiot.

899
01:29:15,641 --> 01:29:18,018
Which is why you've got ahead.

900
01:29:26,361 --> 01:29:28,403
You're right, Mick.

901
01:29:30,615 --> 01:29:32,783
You're exactly right.

902
01:29:46,005 --> 01:29:47,756
Okay.

903
01:29:49,425 --> 01:29:53,428
- I'm going to make this movie without you.
- Oh, come on, Mick ...

904
01:29:54,430 --> 01:29:56,390
Life goes on!

905
01:29:56,432 --> 01:29:59,267
Even without all that
cinema bullshit!

906
01:30:39,350 --> 01:30:43,103
You know how many actresses
I worked with in my career?

907
01:30:44,939 --> 01:30:46,565
... Lots, I guess.

908
01:30:46,607 --> 01:30:48,358
More than 50.

909
01:30:49,569 --> 01:30:52,237
I launched more than 50 actresses.

910
01:30:54,365 --> 01:30:57,451
And they've always been grateful to me.

911
01:31:01,372 --> 01:31:03,999
I'm a great women's director.

912
01:31:04,125 --> 01:31:06,835
"That way, Frank ..."

913
01:31:08,212 --> 01:31:10,755
"That way you'll never forget me."

914
01:31:13,009 --> 01:31:16,511
- Do you remember, Mr. Boyle?
- Sure, I remember.

915
01:31:17,763 --> 01:31:21,016
I remember everything
I ever shot.

916
01:31:23,269 --> 01:31:26,980
Mr. Boyle you're not a great
women's director.

917
01:31:29,025 --> 01:31:31,026
You're a great director.

918
01:31:32,153 --> 01:31:33,904
Period.

919
01:32:00,389 --> 01:32:03,308
Okay, I've made up my mind.

920
01:32:05,686 --> 01:32:07,896
I went to the ATM.

921
01:32:11,567 --> 01:32:14,069
And what do you want to do?

922
01:32:17,031 --> 01:32:18,949
Go for a walk.

923
01:32:53,484 --> 01:32:56,444
Would you like to try climbing?

924
01:32:56,737 --> 01:33:00,490
You know, I can make a man
go wild in bed if I want.

925
01:33:05,871 --> 01:33:08,957
Come on kids,
What's with the long faces?

926
01:33:09,208 --> 01:33:11,501
Hitches, the lease,
the shooting ...

927
01:33:11,627 --> 01:33:14,504
There are constants in our line of work.
Get used to it!

928
01:33:14,630 --> 01:33:16,506
I've already talked to the producer.

929
01:33:16,591 --> 01:33:20,844
Just the question of coming up with
another actress and the shooting starts.

930
01:33:21,387 --> 01:33:23,888
Just a matter of waiting
a few more months.

931
01:33:24,015 --> 01:33:26,641
What a bitch that Brenda Morel is!

932
01:33:27,518 --> 01:33:30,228
Don't talk like that about Brenda Morel.

933
01:33:30,396 --> 01:33:34,149
- Goes where the wind blows.
- Which is what we all do.

934
01:33:35,526 --> 01:33:37,611
And that's what you all will do ...

935
01:33:38,779 --> 01:33:41,740
... In order to survive in this jungle.

936
01:33:45,119 --> 01:33:46,870
It's not true ...

937
01:33:47,496 --> 01:33:51,791
... That she came to Europe especially
to meet with you, Mick.

938
01:33:52,168 --> 01:33:54,669
I read that she's
going to Cannes to some...

939
01:33:55,546 --> 01:33:57,922
... Charity ball at the film festival.

940
01:33:58,424 --> 01:34:02,052
Now let's not get caught up
in all this truth now.

941
01:34:03,638 --> 01:34:07,140
Remember that fiction
is our passion.

942
01:34:08,059 --> 01:34:12,312
Your film Testament is worth a whole lot more
than one more TV series, Mick.

943
01:34:12,438 --> 01:34:14,814
My film Testament?

944
01:34:15,274 --> 01:34:19,194
Let's... Let's be rational here.
Let's not over-read things.

945
01:34:20,571 --> 01:34:23,323
Most of the men done
not only without the Testament...

946
01:34:23,449 --> 01:34:25,200
... But without anyone
even noticing.

947
01:34:25,326 --> 01:34:30,038
- Many men are not great artists
like you. - It doesn't make any difference!

948
01:34:30,081 --> 01:34:32,832
Men, artists, animals, plants ...

949
01:34:39,715 --> 01:34:42,342
We all just extras.

950
01:35:13,624 --> 01:35:15,750
Mick!

951
01:35:16,377 --> 01:35:18,753
How am I supposed to say
this line, Mick?

952
01:35:19,004 --> 01:35:20,588
I don't get it.

953
01:35:21,215 --> 01:35:22,757
How do you want it, Mick?

954
01:35:22,967 --> 01:35:25,135
Sincere or smug, wicked?

955
01:35:25,386 --> 01:35:28,513
And my walk? How is my
character supposed to move?

956
01:35:34,645 --> 01:35:36,521
Perhaps you do not know, James ...

957
01:35:37,398 --> 01:35:40,650
... That I never even stepped foot
on a yacht that is less than 20 feet.

958
01:35:40,735 --> 01:35:44,279
My guys, where did you hide my
lilac slippers?

959
01:35:44,405 --> 01:35:46,406
Enough already!

960
01:35:46,532 --> 01:35:49,117
Prince, I am the owner of six castles
and twenty carriages.

961
01:35:49,160 --> 01:35:52,120
But there is only one thing
I can declare with certainty:

962
01:35:52,288 --> 01:35:54,622
Life is so tiresome.

963
01:35:57,293 --> 01:35:59,419
If you suffer from a psychiatric pain ...

964
01:35:59,670 --> 01:36:03,548
... being a police officer in L.A.
is a real drag.

965
01:36:06,802 --> 01:36:08,261
Oh, Albert ...

966
01:36:08,429 --> 01:36:12,640
If only you knew how much it has costed
me to guard my virginity ...

967
01:36:12,683 --> 01:36:16,060
... All these years ...
Until today.

968
01:36:17,021 --> 01:36:18,772
Until I met you!

969
01:36:19,565 --> 01:36:22,192
Psi-gamma reactor is malfunctioning.

970
01:36:22,318 --> 01:36:26,696
Earth will explode in 5, 4, 3 ...

971
01:36:26,906 --> 01:36:28,656
2, 1 ...

972
01:36:29,575 --> 01:36:32,410
Okay, you win ...

973
01:36:32,536 --> 01:36:34,078
... I'll go to bed with you ...

974
01:36:34,580 --> 01:36:37,207
... On one condition.

975
01:36:37,333 --> 01:36:39,918
That you don't come.

976
01:36:40,085 --> 01:36:42,086
That way, Frank ...

977
01:36:42,963 --> 01:36:47,550
- That way you'll never forget me.
- Where did you hide my lilac slippers?

978
01:37:51,657 --> 01:37:54,659
So you... spoked to the producer?

979
01:37:55,786 --> 01:37:59,622
II've been in this business too long
not to know that without Brenda ...

980
01:37:59,665 --> 01:38:01,666
... This film is never going to be made.

981
01:38:08,757 --> 01:38:10,925
Melanie is so beautiful in that picture.

982
01:38:11,135 --> 01:38:12,802
You are right.

983
01:38:13,137 --> 01:38:15,138
She is beautiful.

984
01:38:17,933 --> 01:38:21,185
You know, I've come to understand
something Fred.

985
01:38:21,520 --> 01:38:24,939
The people are either
beautiful or ugly.

986
01:38:25,274 --> 01:38:28,192
The ones in-between are merely cute.

987
01:38:30,070 --> 01:38:34,532
So... Another vacation almost over.

988
01:38:38,203 --> 01:38:39,704
What will you do next, Fred?

989
01:38:39,955 --> 01:38:42,081
What am I supposed to do!

990
01:38:42,833 --> 01:38:44,709
I'll go home.

991
01:38:44,835 --> 01:38:47,045
The usual routine.

992
01:38:48,714 --> 01:38:50,298
Not me.

993
01:38:52,718 --> 01:38:55,219
I don't do routine.

994
01:38:57,723 --> 01:38:59,849
I know what I am going to do, Fred?

995
01:39:02,561 --> 01:39:05,730
I'm going to start another film.

996
01:39:07,816 --> 01:39:10,818
You say that emotions
are overrated.

997
01:39:11,862 --> 01:39:14,238
But that's bullshit.

998
01:39:15,741 --> 01:39:18,743
Emotions are all
what we've got.

999
01:40:13,632 --> 01:40:17,260
No! Leave me!

1000
01:40:22,933 --> 01:40:25,309
I have to get off this plane!

1001
01:40:25,436 --> 01:40:29,939
- Mick! Forgive me!
- Please, ma'am!

1002
01:40:30,816 --> 01:40:33,526
You fucking bitch,
You let me off!

1003
01:41:10,689 --> 01:41:13,733
I know I should not land here.

1004
01:41:18,447 --> 01:41:22,617
Mick Boyle used to come by
pretty often for a chat.

1005
01:41:22,701 --> 01:41:25,870
Why did you called me, Doctor?
Did you want to tell me something?

1006
01:41:25,996 --> 01:41:30,124
I have the results of all the check-ups
you've been doing during your holidays.

1007
01:41:30,375 --> 01:41:32,210
And what did they say?

1008
01:41:32,377 --> 01:41:35,588
You're as healthy as a horse,
Mr. Ballinger.

1009
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:42,261
My ... prostate at least?

1010
01:41:42,513 --> 01:41:44,263
Your  prostate?

1011
01:41:45,390 --> 01:41:48,893
You've never had a problem
with your prostate.

1012
01:41:49,603 --> 01:41:52,396
And if you haven't had
any problems so far ...

1013
01:41:52,773 --> 01:41:55,900
You certainly not going to start
having them now.

1014
01:41:58,529 --> 01:42:00,113
So ...

1015
01:42:00,155 --> 01:42:05,493
I've grown old without understanding
how I got here.

1016
01:42:07,037 --> 01:42:09,664
Do you know what
awaits you outside of here?

1017
01:42:11,416 --> 01:42:12,917
No. What?

1018
01:42:13,669 --> 01:42:15,545
Youth.

1019
01:42:29,893 --> 01:42:31,561
Anyway...

1020
01:42:34,565 --> 01:42:38,192
Did he ever say anything
about Gilda Black?

1021
01:42:38,318 --> 01:42:40,695
He never talked about
anything else.

1022
01:42:43,073 --> 01:42:45,283
Was she his girlfriend?

1023
01:42:46,160 --> 01:42:49,579
Girlfriend is ... way to much.

1024
01:42:51,290 --> 01:42:54,458
The only thing that ever happened
was one time ...

1025
01:42:55,210 --> 01:42:57,211
... When they were kids ...

1026
01:42:58,213 --> 01:43:02,341
... They held hands and
walked together for a few yards ...

1027
01:43:02,467 --> 01:43:04,177
... In some park.

1028
01:43:05,971 --> 01:43:07,597
He used to call it:

1029
01:43:07,723 --> 01:43:10,933
"The moment I learned
to ride a bike. "

1030
01:43:14,104 --> 01:43:17,982
- Didn't he ever tell you about it?
- No.

1031
01:43:20,736 --> 01:43:23,112
We only ever told each other ...

1032
01:43:23,697 --> 01:43:25,865
... The good things.

1033
01:44:11,036 --> 01:44:13,412
Fuck!

1034
01:44:57,708 --> 01:44:59,667
I waited till the...

1035
01:44:59,710 --> 01:45:03,838
... Visiting hours
to come and see you.

1036
01:45:08,343 --> 01:45:10,469
They don't know, Melanie.

1037
01:45:11,471 --> 01:45:14,724
Children, don't know
their parents ordeals.

1038
01:45:15,684 --> 01:45:20,229
Sure, they know certain details,
striking elements.

1039
01:45:20,939 --> 01:45:23,065
And they know
what they need to know ...

1040
01:45:23,358 --> 01:45:26,610
... To be on one side or the other.

1041
01:45:29,072 --> 01:45:32,825
They don't know that I trembled ...

1042
01:45:33,577 --> 01:45:37,747
... The first time
I ever saw you on stage.

1043
01:45:38,749 --> 01:45:43,753
All the orchestra behind my back
were laughing at my falling in love.

1044
01:45:43,879 --> 01:45:46,505
And my unexpected fragility.

1045
01:45:49,092 --> 01:45:53,137
They don't know that you sold
of your mother's jewellery ...

1046
01:45:53,263 --> 01:45:56,140
... In order to help me
with my second piece ...

1047
01:45:56,850 --> 01:45:59,352
... When everyone else
was turning me down ...

1048
01:45:59,394 --> 01:46:04,273
... Calling me "presumptuous",
"inelegant" musician.

1049
01:46:06,026 --> 01:46:08,152
They don't know...

1050
01:46:08,403 --> 01:46:10,780
... That you too,
and you were right ...

1051
01:46:11,490 --> 01:46:19,038
... That you thought I was a presumptuous,
inelegant musician at that time.

1052
01:46:21,041 --> 01:46:23,042
And you cried so hard.

1053
01:46:23,668 --> 01:46:25,544
Not because you sold
you mother's jewellery ...

1054
01:46:25,754 --> 01:46:28,881
... But because you sold
your mother.

1055
01:46:32,928 --> 01:46:36,180
They don't know that
we were together ...

1056
01:46:36,890 --> 01:46:38,766
...You and I...

1057
01:46:38,809 --> 01:46:43,938
... Despite all the exhaustion,
and the pain, and hardship.

1058
01:46:47,192 --> 01:46:49,318
Melanie ...

1059
01:46:50,320 --> 01:46:52,822
They must never know ...

1060
01:46:53,532 --> 01:46:55,533
... That you and I ...

1061
01:46:56,034 --> 01:46:58,285
...despite everything...

1062
01:47:00,288 --> 01:47:02,456
... Liked to think of ourselves ...

1063
01:47:03,458 --> 01:47:05,918
... As a simple song.

1064
01:49:52,627 --> 01:49:54,753
Look at me.

1065
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:33,000
Fixed and Synced
Pulpy
