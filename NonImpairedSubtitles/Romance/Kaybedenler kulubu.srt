00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:04,552
EKIP FILM ANXIOUSLYPRESENTS...

2
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,918
It's 12.00. The PrIme MInIster

3
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,674
So, on we go together
In the sIIence of the nIght...

4
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,070
...you'II hear the wackIest stuff
on thIs frequency...

5
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,109
Yes, Kent IIsteners out there,

6
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:38,355
My frIend Mete Avunduk and I,

00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,518
...as we are every Monday,
Tuesday and Thursday.

9
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,509
And thIs Tuesday nIght,
I guess pretty much Iike you guys...

10
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,200

11
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,830
...Iike if onIy this hourwouId end
and we couId get out of here.

12
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,755
Good evening.
Kent FM.

13
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,472
One second.

14
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,797
Mete, there's a caIIer on the IIne.
She wants to be put through.

15
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,993
Go ahead.

16
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,958
- HeIIo? Good evenIng.
- HeIIo. Have we had sex before?

17
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,633
- No.
- What are you up to tonight?

18
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,918
- LIstenIng to you. How are you?
- Standard.

19
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,310
Me too, standard.

20
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,518
May God keep you standard.
So what are you up to tonight?

21
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,360
- GoIng out to a bar soon.
- Which bar?

22
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,636
- No Idea.
- What wiII you do afterwards?

23
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,798
- Go home. I have work tomorrow.
- We aII work.

24
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,953
We aII work. We'II aII sIeep.
That's what I don't get.

25
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:01,119
- Why do we sIeep separateIy? Why?
- As we'II aII sIeep, why sIeep apart?

26
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,158
Why sIeep apart?
Why not sIeep together tonight?

27
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,153
- So wiII you sIeep with me tonight?
- Sure.

28
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,629
- No, but seriousIy.
- I saId I wouId, dIdn't I?

29
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,836
- C'mon, pIease!
- I saId OK.

30
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,956
Besides, I get kind of Iike..

31
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,996
I now know I'II be sIeeping with
you tonight, right? So I'm kind of..

32
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,273
- You kind of, weII, reIax.
- No, Mete. I don't reIax.

33
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,598
I mean, I get seriousIy hard.

34
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,475
HeIIo?.. HeIIo?

35
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,677
- There's a saying..
- HeIIo?

36
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,993
- From Siberia, I guess.
- HeIIo?

37
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,913
- If I know what I'm doing that night...
- HeIIo?

38
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,348
C'mon, Iet's grab some meatbaIIs.
Let's go pumping.

39
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:57,312
Yes, Kent Iisteners out there.
This is the Losers CIub.

40
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:02,191
As aIways, we dedicate tonight's show
to the Montana gang...

41
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,794
...to the streets of Kadýköy...

42
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:08,595
...where we've Iearned, and are
stiII Iearning about Iife and women...

43
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:13,754
...and to aII the bad kids in town.
We'd stay with you aII night, but...

44
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:20,112
...as you'II appreciate, Iisteners,
we, too, have a sex Iife.

45
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,632
Have a good night, Iisteners,
if, of course, that's possibIe.

46
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,512
- Coming from the radio?
- Yes.

47
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,789
How's it going?

48
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,595
Good. Passes the time.

49
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,154
Got a Iot of Iisteners?

50
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,635
- Loads. Like you'd never beIieve.
- Good. That's great.

51
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,350
I'm at your pIace tonight.
I've asked the girIs over.

52
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:58,149
I have to be at the offýce at 10.00.
I need to pin down EroI Egemen.

53
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,437
- Or he won't deIiver the cover designs.
- What are you pubIishing?

54
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:07,158
WiIIiam BIake, Songs of Innocence.
PIus RoIand Barthes, Camera Lucida.

55
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,392
- Great.
- Hmm, great. ProbabIy seII 125 copies.

56
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:16,832
Then I'II stare at the stocks Ieftover
and think what a great thing I did.

57
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,150
You can reaIIy seII 125?

58
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,637
I pubIish books that never seII
and do a radio show no one Iistens to.

59
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,549
That's great.

60
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,920
The objectIve
Is to pass on theIr genes.

61
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:45,191
And copuIatIon Is quIck...
...for successfuI conceptIon...

62
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,075
- Hi, Ayþe.
- Hi.

63
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,753
I'm Sinem.

64
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,714
- How you doing, Murat?
- Standard.

65
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,949
You?

66
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,474
CopuIatIon occurs three tImes an hour.

67
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:07,677
OK, trying to get work done.

68
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,954
Losers have ampIe chance to copuIate.

69
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:14,673
CopuIatIon Iasts around 20 seconds.

70
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,351
WIth a fIve-day fertIIIty perIod,
It can mean copuIatIng over 300 tImes.

71
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,555
AnimaI!

72
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,911
How's the transIation going?

73
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,075
I had other stuff to do.
I was busy.

74
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,793
What other stuff?

75
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,957
Look, I had stuff to do.
Don't give me stress.

76
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:03,230
MaIe IIons have anatomIcaI advantages
to make up for theIr InferIor weIght.

77
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,833
Good Iuck.

78
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,872
I woke up aIone thIs mornIng

79
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,832
I took a Iook at myself
In the mIrror

80
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,155
How hard It Is decIdIng to go

81
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,915
I have to get out of here fast

82
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,189
I thInk of the road

83
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,435
I always taIk of goIng

84
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,713
I can't breathe In thIs cIty

85
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,794
I have to get out of here fast

86
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,388
HeIIo..
Hi, what's up?

87
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,635
He'II taIk to you about the cover
anyway when he gets here.

88
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,635
No, he hasn't seen
the Iatest version yet.

89
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,670
Look, he's just waIked in.

90
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,196
- EroI Egemen.
- Connect him through.

91
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,394
I'm putting you through.

92
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,749
- HeIIo.
- How you doing? Seen the cover?

93
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,156
- Yeah, nice.
- Thanks.

94
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:36,391
Suppose we make the photo a bit smaIIer
and sIide it to the right, huh?

95
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,594
What do you say? If you're done
by next week, no probIem.

96
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,190
OK, bye then. Bye.

97
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,199
What's up?

98
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,719
ShaII I start?

99
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,031
Nick Cave is back from transIation.
The printers asked for the cheque.

100
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,715
Two boxes of returns for Cortázar.

101
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:14,233
Payment wiII be touch and go
this month but..

102
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,039
PIus there's rent.

103
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,839
Arrivederci.

104
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,679
Same to you too.

105
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,879
- Did the whisky show up?
- Yeah, it did.

106
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,879
Anything interesting?

107
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,788
So?

108
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,796
Most coIIectors aren't aware
the thing even exists.

109
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,994
The record, OK.
But no one has a cover Iike this.

110
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,918
It's amazing.

111
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,194
Can I take a Iook?

112
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,832
No, you can't.

113
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,439
Why can't I Iook?
You care for it more than me?

114
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,232
What was your name?

115
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,992
Hande. You forgot?

116
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,352
What's up tonight?

117
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,352
Come to my pIace after the show.

118
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,712
Boss.. Let's go.

119
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,195
OK.

120
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,599
- Ohhh - I remembered my ex.
- Which one?

121
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,196
That's the thing, I don't remember.

122
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,635
Did you ever get the feeIing that
someone or something owns you.

123
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:33,155
Yeah, sure. And whenever I reaIized it,
I wanted to Ieave.

124
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,395
Some peopIe go after
getting married and having kids.

125
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,878
I mean, that's what they vaIue.

126
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,711
And others vaIue other things.

127
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:52,431
One doesn't think about why
one vaIues those things.

128
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,470
Not the person that's Iost
in society...

129
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,189
Society destroys your individuaIity...

130
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:03,359
...insofar as it presents
getting into coIIege as a vaIue.

131
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:07,394
You compete to get into coIIege,
compete to get into university...

132
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:11,030
...compete to get a good job,
compete to marry a gorgeous woman.

133
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,470
There's aIways pressure
to compete and win.

134
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,597
What, in fact, is winning?

135
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,276
Think of it as if you are Antonius
and you won the greatest victory

136
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:22,199
and you come to Paris and
stand under that victory arch..

137
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:26,991
...and aII the peopIe are under you
and you have the uItimate power.

138
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:31,632
If you think in that IoneIy moment,
'Hey, so what? What happens now?...'

139
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:37,711
...then you're the Ioser. That moment,
with the greatest victory, you've Iost.

140
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,436
WeII, does being aware of that...

141
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:48,348
...offer us everything Iife can't,
as an oId Red Indian once said?

142
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,997
Or, as a Iistener once said,
is art...

143
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:59,757
...Iike everything eIse, for sex?
How wrong can an oId Red Indian be?

144
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,191
Sometimes he may be wrong.

145
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,238
- Sometimes he says nothing.
- Sometimes he wants to taIk.

146
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,555
- Sometimes he wants to Iisten.
- Sometimes he wants to be aIone.

147
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,715
- Sometimes he wants company.
- Sometimes he wants to go.

148
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,633
- He goes sometimes.
- Sometimes he can't.

149
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:23,037
Sometimes he's afraid of
not being abIe to go.

150
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:26,836
- Some are born into endIess sunshine.
- Some into endIess night.

151
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,592
- Sometimes you die.
- Sometimes you can't.

152
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,112
Sometimes you can't die
even when everything says you shouId.

153
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,633
Sometimes you want
to get away from yourseIf.

154
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,759
Sometimes you go
just to be abIe to come back.

155
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:45,557
- Sometimes you cry a Iot.
- Sometimes you just can't.

156
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:51,310
Sometimes you drink. And sometimes
you want to drink reaIIy a Iot.

157
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,560
Sometimes you go to drink anyway.

158
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,829
Sometimes you jump in a cab
in Ac?badem, you say ''Kadýköy''...

159
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:02,432
...and sometimes the guy
doesn't even Iook at you.

160
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,230
Sometimes a woman comes aIong...

161
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,599
...she sits down across from you
and cries.

162
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:12,352
- Women aIways cry.
- Sometimes a woman says to you...

163
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:16,195
''The thing that scares me most is
a woman's tears'' Speaking for herseIf.

164
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,951
''If you reaIIy Ioved,''
she says.

165
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,591
But what she doesn't know is
that Ioving beIongs to a moment.

166
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,151
- Everything starts with water.
- PhiIosophy, too.

167
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:41,429
- HeIIo? Good evenIng.
- HeIIo. Have we had sex before?

168
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,558
- Excuse me?
- Are you technicaIIy a woman?

169
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:48,629
- Yes. BIoIogIcaIIy too, of course.
- When was yourfýrst opening?

170
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,633
What openIng?

171
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:55,516
Grand opening. We're taIking the fýrst pump.
La pompa. II pompino. Le pompier.

172
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,954
Hasn't happened yet.

173
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:03,719
In that case,
Iet's taIk in a few years.

174
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:07,350
- Why?
- Because tonight we're voting on...

175

183
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:52,672
'Why do those words aIways strike me
as dreary and coId?'

184
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:57,632
'Is it perhaps because there's no word
exquisite enough to be your name?'

185
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:02,037
- Which was yourfavourite?

186

187
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,310
'Because we don't know
when we wiII die...'

188
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,034
'...we get to think of Iife
as an inexhaustibIe weII.'

189
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,754
- They're hazeInut this time.

193
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,557
So what are you going to do?

194
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,238

WouId you Iike me to heIp out?

198
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,953
Don't girIs get offended

199
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,070
No idea.

200
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,470
Come in.

201
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:13,868

This week's programme Iist,
Miss AsIý.

203
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,508
Did you Iisten to
the Losers CIub Iast night?

204
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:25,308
- No. Why?
- PeopIe have caIIed to compIain.

205
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:29,911
- Those 8-10 idiots do that every show.

206
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,993
- There were 385 compIaints.

207
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,112
-385. The Iines were jammed.
- What happened?

208
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,960
They proposed sex to a femaIe Iistener
on the show.

209
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:44,075
Then they voted on the most popuIar
sex positions of the 20th century.

210
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:51,313
They're vuIgar. ShameIess.
How do you aIIow It?

211
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,312
- OK, I'II handIe it.

212
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,712

213
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,273
Which position won?

214
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,190

215
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,510
Tuesday. I aIways goes Tuesdays.
It's quieter.

216
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,673
- My boxers are worn out.

217
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,919
Its time to break fast in SeattIe.

218
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,276

219
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,630

221
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,875

222
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,748
- It doesn't.
- Good night, caIIer. Have we sIept together?

00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,919

224
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:36,517

- I don't remember anything after 1980.

225
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,280
- Its time to break fast in New York.
- We're wasting our time here.

226
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,833
- C'mon, Iet's go to OIympos.

- ReaIIy, who the heII is EroI Egemen?

229
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,713
Who the fuck is EroI Egemen
for god's sake?

230
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,348
As I see it, Iife is about being
in the wrong pIace at the wrong time.

231
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,748
What have you done in Iife?

232
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,713
Did you do a $500 miIIion saIe
or cross the Suez CanaI twice?

233
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,911

234

241
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:21,716

242
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:25,595
- Aren't memories Iost if they're shared?
- Memories hurt when they're shared.

243
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,036
Why does everythIng you taIk about
InvoIve sex?

244
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,476
We don't know anything

245
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,269
- So who the heII is this EroI Egemen?!

247
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,918
- Yes.
- But I stIII caIIed.

248
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:43,910
Bravo.

249
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,198
Can I do the usuaI and ask
for a song not to be pIayed?

250
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,958

251
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,032
Sure. We're not pIaying

253
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,200
We boycott anyone who's not a
fan of the singer Orhan Gencebay.

254
00:19:57,235 --> 00:19:58,792
We boycott anyone who disIikes

255
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,839

- If you're rockers, why pIay TurkIsh

256
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,439
What's it to you?

257
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,113

258
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,033
C'mon.

00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,039
ShaII we head back?

260
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,193
Evening time.

261
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,919
Another awesome cover.

262
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:34,958
Right. It's that EroI Egemen touch.
SimpIicity.

263
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:36,950
Right, huh?

264
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,716
Mete, I dropped by Lütfü's on my way.
He had a coupIe of Ottoman documents.

265
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,115
- Did he say anything?
- That you shouId go take a Iook.

266
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,035
- Then he has something good for sure.
- For sure.

267
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,835
I'm putting pepper on the tomatoes.
Anyone object?

268
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:57,071
Good. At Ieast everyone at this tabIe
has read the Iatest Brautigan. CooI.

269
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,799
I'II start on the raki
in three hours.

270
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,794
- It'II take that Iong?
- What?

271
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,871
- For you to start?
- Yeah, it takes time.

272
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,438
I'm at the bar again that day.
Not drinking.

273
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:16,275
- I know. Sure. You never drink.
- I hate the damn stuff.

274
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:19,193
Fuck your radio taIk!

275
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,830
- What the fuck's going on with you?
- What?

276
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:28,517
I think it's great.
I mean, standard.

277
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,553
What was your name?

278
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:37,916
AsshoIe!

279
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,278
That's kind of an AngIo-Saxon name.
You from Nottingham?

280
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,752
Watch out, Kadýköy's a sIippery pIace.
Don't faII!

281
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,672
- You guys are shits.
- What can I do? I don't remember.

282
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,396
- NorwouId I with that many women.
- It's not in his genes, girI.

283
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,229
No, I mean,
why is one woman not enough?

284
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:04,274
Being enough or not isn't the issue.
Some guys spend 60 years with a woman.

285
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:08,992
- Some can't. That's aII.
- But you guys aIways have stocks on hand.

286
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:13,272
We're not taIking four orfýve.
Why does it have to be so many?

287
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:19,194
WeII, Header, it happens. That's why.
Nothing deep. Don't make a deaI of it.

288
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,749
Fine.

289
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:26,118
- What did Orhan VeIi say?
- No idea. What did he say?

290
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:29,477
How do I know? He must have had
something to say about it for sure.

291
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,639
AbsoIuteIy. Cheers!

292
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,755
God, I'm IoneIy!

293
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:12,117
Are you kidding? The other day
I thought I was dying of IoneIiness.

294
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:25,071
WeIghIng In at 250 kIIos,
it's Africa's...

295
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,788
- What's up?
- Standard.

296
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,596
Try some pizza on your mayonnaise
next time.

297
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,793
KiIIs the taste. The pizza's so gross
it's the onIy way I can eat it.

298
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:47,278
- Don't spiII it on the carpet.
- Don't worry. I got you.

299
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,515
How's the transIation going?

300
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,200
Good. Coming aIong fýne.

301
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,074
- Who are you?
- Þebnem.

302
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,680
- Want some?
- No, thanks.

303
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:20,518
- How's it going, Þebnem?
- Standard.

304
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,514
Great.

305
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,838
May God keep you standard.

306
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:04,356
The bottIe Iooks Iike
a beautifuI bIack woman, huh?

307
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,999
What do you reckon?

308
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,119
Liquid..

309
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:23,269
Like the bIood of a dragon
kiIIed before its time.

310
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,632
Gushing foam.

311
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,432
And burning.

312
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,712
As much as IoneIiness.

313
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,189
Distance is not a function of time.

314
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,709
Speed is distance divided by time.

315
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,751
AcceIeration and the coeffýcient of
friction are neither here nor there.

316
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:24,949
Being on the road
requires having speed.

317
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,997
The converse is to stop on the road.

318
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,754
Stopping is boring.

319
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:46,159
Stopping on the road doesn't mean
being on the road.

320
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:51,035
Stopping on the road
means stopping on the road.

321
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:55,389
You don't stop at the end of the road.

322
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:59,597
You stop either beforehand
or not at aII.

323
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,032
Sometimes cIear coIourIess water
flows by the side of the road.

324
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:12,279
And there are fýsh in that water.

325
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,272
The road cIeaves through hiIIs,
one of them an earthy green...

326
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,789
...the other perhaps ochre.

327
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:23,553
The water doesn't take on the coIour
of the Iand it flows through.

328
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,950
Though it may seem that way to you.

329
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,792
And aIso...

330
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,788
...the road never ends.

331
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,159
That's the waII of the Iabyrinth.

332
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,828
Yes.

333
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,310
The road never ends.

334
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,078
This is the Losers CIub.

335
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:54,193
Our number is 2122721065.

336
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:01,718
- Good evening, Iistener.
- Good evening, mister.

337
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,029
Your name?

338
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,589
Birdbrain, Iet's say.

339
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,629
Go ahead, Iistener.

340
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:12,518
The further away you are from yourseIf
the cIoser you actuaIIy are.

341
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:17,993
The pIace furthest away from you
in this worId is actuaIIy your back.

342
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:24,679
Big differences sometimes
bring peopIe cIoser.

343
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:31,351
ActuaIIy, aII journeys made
on the surface of a sphere...

344
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:35,195
...serve onIy to progress
towards the starting point.

345
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,193
- What are they saying?
- I vaIue two things in Iife.

346
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:41,670
- I don'treaIIy know, but I Iove It.
- one... one Is InteIIIgence. You have both.

347
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,598
- They're Into reaIIy deep stuff.
- Thanks.

348
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,758
But my theory Is thIs.:
that IIfe Is always about...

349
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:50,678
...not beIng In the rIght pIace
at the rIght tIme.

350
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,759
If you ask me, IIfe Is about beIng
In the wrong pIace at the wrong tIme.

351
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,471
It's more or Iess the same.

352
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,357
Yes, Iistener?

353
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:07,148
- HeIIo?
- Your name?

354
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:11,593
- BrIt.
- Where are you caIIing from?

355
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,519
Kadýköy.

356
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,953
I'm so IoneIy.

357
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,794
LoneIiness makes you a drag, Brit.

358
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:27,715
God damn me. I teII you,
IoneIiness is making me nauseous.

359
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,997
Me too, Brit. Me too.

360
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,758
Another morning wiII come.
Another new day wiII start.

361
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,636
And I'II dIe another death.

362
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,556
- So you're on a downer.
- Yes.

363
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,637
Life sucks.

364
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:50,997
So Iet's do this. Let's make you
the Chief of Sorrow for Kadýköy.

365
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:56,191
Give us a caII once in a whiIe
and report back, OK?

366
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,513
OK.

367
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:03,391
Look, suppose we do the ohm
and unIoad some of this stress?

368
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:08,749
- Ohm?
- Ohm. You know, Iike yoga.

369
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:15,354
C'mon, Iet's aII do the ohm.
Ohmmmm

370
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:53,755
Ohmmmm...
Header's flying.

371
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:23,917
For you, Brit.
Don't Iet us miss you.

372
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:35,757
I pIcture the sprawIIng past

373
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:40,557
Where Is my Iover?
Where am I?

374
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:45,557
Where dId we go wrong
for us to break up thatway?

375
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:50,632
I've Iost my sense of self
See the state I'm In

376
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:55,672
I pIcture the sprawIIng past

377
00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:01,392
Where Is my Iover?
Where am I?

378
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:06,397
Where dId we go wrong
for us to break up thatway?

379
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:11,472
I've Iost my sense of self
See the state I'm In

380
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:16,917
My sorrow has grown so bad
It's spIIIIng out of me

381
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:22,635
If I bIamed fate a thousand tImes
ItwouIdn't be enough

382
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:27,872
Speak of happy thIngs,
my wIshIng stone

383
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:32,872
To tear-stung eyes
so Iong unused to smIIIng

384
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:43,799
- Wasn't our appointment at 1.00?
- I onIy just woke up. Sorry.

385
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,512
- Where's Kaan?
- At his offýce. He couIdn't get away.

386
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,673
WeII? How're things?
Any requests? Any compIaints?

387
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,315
No.

388
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:58,749
- I guess the show's picked up a bit.
- No idea. ReaIIy?

389
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:02,591
Not bad. And if we work a bit harder
it'II get even better.

390
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:06,471
In fact, we couId get some ads.
We couId even pay you.

391
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:11,072
- But?
- Tone it down a bit.

392
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:15,077
In the past week we received
600 compIaints and a second warning.

393
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,430
They'II shut us down because of you two.

394
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:21,270
But we don't pIan what to say
orwhere the show's going.

395
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,791
It's kind of Iike improvisation.

396
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:29,316
Do you have to beIch, swear on air
or proposition to every femaIe caIIer?

397
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,391
Don't know. Don't we?

398
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:37,112
The other night you spent 40 minutes
on a Ieek recipe...

399
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,630
...and 45 minutes
on premature ejacuIation.

400
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:43,589
- Is there nothing eIse?
- Don't know. Is there?

401
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,278
That's just the way it worked out
that night. What can we do?

402
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:51,311
We can't do the show any otherway.
It's our styIe.

403
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:56,549
I reaIize that. But this is Turkey.
They'II shut the station down.

404
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,998
TaIk to Kaan.

405
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,390
You're onto something good.
Don't Iet it go, I say.

406
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,796
You have my support if you want it.

407
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:24,919
Evening, Kent Iisteners out there.
This is the Losers CIub.

408
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:47,799
FaIIIng In Iove Is Instantaneous.

409
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,913
It's an Instantwhere suddenIy
everythIng appears brIghter...

410
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:54,112
...where suddenIy
even the paIest coIours begIn to gIow...

411
00:38:55,680 --> 00:39:00,356
...where suddenIy
aII food bursts wIth fIavour.

412
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,920
You don't decIde to faII In Iove.

413
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,712
You justreaIIze...

414
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,872
...It's happened.

415
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:21,115
When wiII I see you again?

416
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:26,153
If you come to Beþiktaþ Pier
in three days, you'II see me.

417
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,672
Hey, what was your name?

418
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,630
Don't know. I don't remember.

419
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:38,832
Let's say 6.45.

420
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:10,956
- What are you up to?
- Resting my mind.

421
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:14,709
- I took a break.
- Since when?

422
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:20,238
Two.. Three.. Six.. Eight..

423
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,712
Hasn't been Iong.

424
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:31,798
Hey, I just met an awesome woman.
She's bIown my mind.

425
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,633
What's her name?

426
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:39,796
- I don't know.
- Where is she?

427
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:44,956
We're meeting in three days
at Beþiktaþ Pier. At 6.45.

428
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,193
Great.

429
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:53,116
The Beþiktaþ Pier in Beþiktaþ
or the Beþiktaþ Pier in Kadýköy?

430
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,228
No idea.

431
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,274
Good Iuck.

432
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,194
Thanks.

433
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,309
- HeIIo?
- Brit, I want to ask you something.

434
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:16,760
If someone said the Beþiktaþ Pier,
which one wouId you think it was...

435
00:41:16,795 --> 00:41:20,389
- ...Kadýköy or Beþiktaþ?
- I have nothIng to do wIth pIers.

436
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:24,711
- Ask EroI Egemen.
- OK, got it. But which one?

437
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,316
- I'd thInk Kadýköy.
- Me too.

438
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:31,513
- I'd thInk BeþIktaþ.
- HeIIo?.. HeIIo?

439
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,918
Yes, heIIo, Iistener?

440
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:40,992
- There's a great IIon documentary on TV.
- Thanks, Iistener.

441
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:43,959
PIus there's a gIrI here caIIed Ceyda,
she's waItIng for Mete.

442
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:48,956
- TeII her not to wait. I'II be Iate.
- OK. Good Iuck.

443
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,795
He'II be back Iate.

444
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:02,717
OK..
Hey, turn on the radio, huh?

445
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,117
TaIking of being Iate,
I came earIy the other day.

446
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:18,274
- What do you mean?
- Let me expIain.

447
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:21,230
It was a morning Iike any other.

448
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:25,473
It was bIowing up a storm outside
and had started to drizzIe.

449
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:29,435
I'd sat down to a Iight breakfast,
had poured my coffee...

450
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:33,157
...and was eating
a smaII piece of cheese.

451
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:36,713
I asked if she wanted coffee.
She did.

452
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:41,870
She grabbed her coffee and sat down
on the chair beside me.

453
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:46,236
She was Iistening to the rain
and the ever-Iate spring.

454
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:50,677
I Ieaned over to the strawberry jam
in front of me.

455
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:53,394
I took a smaII spoonfuI.

456
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:57,237
As I Iifted the spoon to my mouth
the jam dribbIed onto my neck.

457
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:03,996
I reached down to spoon it off.
She grabbed my hand, pushed it away.

458
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:09,316
She Iooked deep into my eyes.
And put time on hoId.

459
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:13,229
With the tip of her index fýnger...

460
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:16,671
...she scooped the jam
out of the hoIIow of my neck.

461
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,995
She Iifted herfýnger to my Iips.

462
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:23,319
She sIowIy spread the jam
over my Iips.

463
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:27,237
She smeared the rest IingeringIy
over her own Iips.

464
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:32,559
She moistened her Iips with her tongue
and tasted the jam.

465
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:34,039
Hey, what are they taIking about?

466
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:37,789
The rain came down harder.
And mingIed with the wind.

467
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:42,669
She turned towards me.
She bent her head towards me.

468
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:47,638
She IightIy brushed her Iips over mine.

469
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:52,274
She tasted the jam on my Iips.

470
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:56,035
And I tasted the jam on hers.

471
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:01,355
Before drawing her Iips away...

472
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:05,789
...she teased my tongue one Iast time
with the tip of her tongue.

473
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:08,397
She Iicked my Iips.

474
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:12,839
She stood up.

475
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:18,313
She puIIed herwhite shirt
out of the waist of her skirt.

476
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:24,394
Without undoing the buttons,
she hitched it up to her breasts.

477
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,116
She wasn't wearing a bra.

478
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:32,156
She turned me towards her.

479
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:38,320
She sIowIy puIIed up my T-shirt.
She sat on my Iap.

480
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:44,680
GentIy, IingeringIy
she Iet her skin touch mine.

481
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:48,350
Her nippIes brushed my chest.

482
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:53,994
She puIIed up her skirt.
Then..

483
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:59,070
- Then?
- ''What happened?'' she said.

484
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:03,750
- What happened?
- I came earIy.

485
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:39,915
- Are you out of your minds?
- Hey, what's wrong?

486
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:43,590
What do you think? You had
phone sex with aII of IstanbuI.

487
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:47,596
Forget you getting the station banned,
you'II have us aII thrown in jaiI!

488
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:49,432
Let's not exaggerate now.

489
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:55,593
I've said it once, I'II say it again.
This is Turkey.

490
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:59,509
This American rock n roII,
free spirit attitude doesn't fly.

491
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:04,839
- We'II quit if you Iike.
- I'm not saying that. But tone it down.

492
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:08,232
The show can go a Iong way. You too.
Don't pass up this chance.

493
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:10,910
It has nothing to do
with passing up chances!

494
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:13,678
Look, Iet's do this professionaIIy.

495
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:16,075
We'II give you a fee for each show.
Things wiII be easierfor you. And me.

496
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:21,436
- But it's fýne Iike this, huh?
- You don't seem to understand.

497
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:24,996
- I'm saying I'II pay you for the show.
- WeII, I'm just fýne as I am.

498
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:26,908
Me too.

499
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:29,949
One way or other
you'II defýniteIy get something.

500
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:36,549
OK.

501
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:42,236
Can I use this?

502
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:45,356
I'm writing beer.

503
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:49,511
- Write whisky too. Cabs.
- Cabs.

504
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:52,670
- Hakký's MeatbaIIs.
- Ha, meatbaIIs.

505
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:56,350
Anything missing? Take a Iook.

506
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:02,160
Pay for ourfood, drinks and traveI
and that's fýne.

507
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,356
Even beer and whisky expenses is fýne.

508
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:09,671
Why don't you hand it over.
She might object to something.

509
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:12,719
Here you go.

510
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:19,229
OK.

511
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:24,070
- We forgot to write chocoIate.
- Fucking Jesus Christ!

512
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:33,193
- What time are we at Birdbrain's?
- Eight.

513
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:39,869
Do you think we're idiots
to turn down the money?

514
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:42,836
Can you put a price on what we do?

515
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:47,076
I mean, we're not worried about
Iosing the show, right?

516
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:50,677
- Let's not be sIaves to Ioose change.
- Right.

517
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:01,355
Are you sure
it's the Beþiktaþ Pier in Kadýköy?

518
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:05,315
Why did you go to so much troubIe?
I'm about to burst here.

519
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:10,276
It's no troubIe. Come any time.
Thanks for accepting the invitation.

520
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:13,834
It was great, Birdbrain. Thanks.

521
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:22,514
They pIay the same tune
in two different parts of the worId.

522
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:27,073
You're right, they do.

523
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:30,276
I got the new Sturgeon you pubIished.

524
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:33,678
- You mean 'More than Human'?
- Aha. It's great text. ReaIIy.

525
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:37,832
Sure, but that's another book
doomed to be buried in the stock room.

526
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:40,669
No one but Kaan wouId think
to pubIish the book anyway.

527
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:44,835
I'm Iucky then. If you hadn't
pubIished it, I'd never have read it.

528
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:54,113
Two things never change, you know.
My excitement when preparing the books.

529
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:57,189
And then my disappointment
after pubIishing them.

530
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:04,274
SüIeymaniye Mosque has a caretaker.
He's from the town of Van.

531
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:08,397
When he was young, his father
came to IstanbuI on business.

532
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:13,630
On his way back, he brought a photo
of SüIeymaniye Mosque as a souvenir.

533
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,436
The caretakerwas
a young boy at the time.

534
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:19,553
They hang the photo on the waII
in their house in Van.

535
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:26,197
For hours every day, the boy
gazed and gazed at that photo.

536
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:31,879
He became deepIy attached to the photo
his father had brought from IstanbuI.

537
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:37,759
His one dream in Iife now
was to see that mosque.

538
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:41,159
When he was in his 20s
he came to IstanbuI...

539
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:43,635
...and headed straight
for SüIeymaniye Mosque.

540
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:48,396
He saw the mosque.
He sat in the grounds and Iooked.

541
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:54,828
He went inside and prayed.
He just couIdn't Ieave the pIace.

542
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:59,791
Then he began sweeping up the Ieaves
in the grounds. He tended the flowers.

543
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:03,795
Without asking for anything.
Of his own free wiII.

544
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:06,350
The imam at the mosque noticed him.

545
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:10,230
And they decided
to take him on as caretaker.

546
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:14,913
On the upstairs floors
of SüIeymaniye Mosque...

547
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:17,595
...there's a secret room
for the caretaker.

548
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:21,516
No one but the imam and the caretaker
knows about this room.

549
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:25,991
He was given this room.
And rumour has it...

550
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:30,393
...that the view from there
is the very fýnest in IstanbuI.

551
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:36,752
In otherwords, getting to enjoy
such a perfect view...

552
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:40,231
...was onIy made possibIe
by virtue of an everIasting passion.

553
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:49,470
Thanks.

554
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:55,399
Birdbrain, if you'II excuse us,
we have a Iong trek.

555
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:59,030
- We're headed for Kadýköy.
- Just across the bridge, you'II get there.

556
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:01,315
Oh, by the way...

557
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:06,712
...I think that pier has to be
the Beþiktaþ Pier in Kadýköy.

558
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:09,878
Don't you agree?

559
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:58,678
How did you know
I'd be at the right pier?

560
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:02,397
Don't know. I suppose I guessed
you'd show up somehow.

561
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,117
- So you were that sure.
- I wanted you to be sure.

562
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:11,479
I thought if you reaIIy wanted
to see me again, you'd fýnd a way.

563
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:16,353
I see..
So a kind of test.

564
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:18,675
AbsoIuteIy.

565
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:26,392
What do you do in Iife?
I mean, generaIIy?

566
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:30,195
PresumabIy you're trying to ask
what job I do.

567
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:32,630
I'm an architect.

568
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:36,193
I work for an internationaI
architecturaI fýrm caIIed Berk & Smith.

569
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:38,077
Nice.

570
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:41,438
I'm into architecture.

571
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:43,799
Since when?

572
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:46,034
The Iast four days.

573
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:52,751
OK.. What do you do?

574
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:57,192
- I have a pubIishing house.
- ReaIIy?

575
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:59,636
- Which one?
-6.45.

576
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:04,596
- I have a few of your books then.
- ReaIIy? Which ones? I'm curious.

577
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:10,038
Enis Batur, So Much BIood in MiIk.
And Oruç Aruoba. What is Nothing.

578
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:12,112
But there must be a few more.

579
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:19,237
'Soaring on the gentIe wind
the guII set off for the sea.'

580
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:21,192
Great book.

581
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:36,039
Hey, where do you Iive?

582
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:43,475
- In Göztepe. On Minibus Street.
- You Iive aIone?

583
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:46,712
With my big sister. We've shared
since university. We both did uni here.

584
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,672
- Where are you from?
- Edirne.

585
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:52,311
- What does your sister do?
- She's a pharmacist. More questions?

586
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:57,559
What eIse do you do?

587
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:04,713
I take a few photos. When I have time.
PIus I have a smaII radio show.

588
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:08,397
You're invoIved in such great stuff.

589
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:12,874
Compared with yours, my Iife
suddenIy seems reaIIy boring.

590
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:15,635
Anything that becomes routine
is boring, actuaIIy.

591
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:21,035
That's why the grass aIways
Iooks greener on the other side.

592
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:23,550
So don't worry about it.

593
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:29,239
Yes, but things in Iife that aren't
routine can never be Iasting.

594
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:38,637
- Coffee?
- Medium sugar.

595
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:40,830
- Two medium coffees.
- Sure.

596
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:03,637
Do you go out Iike this a Iot?

597
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:06,715
Like this?

598
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:08,709
Like this.

599
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:13,915
Never.

600
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:22,435
Hey, man. Move your motorbike
so I can get out, huh?

601
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:41,870
It's stiII earIy.
Let's wander around.

602
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:03,069
- How you doing?
- Standard.

603
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:07,958
- I guess you went to the right pier.
- Aha. Yes.

604
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:14,398
- Any ice cream Ieft?
- Yeah, I saved you some.

605
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:22,831
Are you kidding?
You son of a bitch..

606
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:27,078
- Is this aII you saved?
- Not enough?

607
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:31,038
You don't Iike bIackberry, so I ate it.
And the raspberry, I did, you know..

608
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:34,230
Why don't you buy some for once
and I'II eat it.

609
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:36,194
What was the girI Iike?

610
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:40,470
TotaIIy different. I mean, good.

611
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:44,831
I haven't met anyone Iike her in ages.

612
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:49,068
Anyhow. I'm going to bed.
Don't spiII on the carpet, OK?

613
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:55,195
The guy's faIIen in Iove
and he doesn't know it.

614
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:58,398
Don't spiII it on the carpet.

615
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:05,274
I guess It's one of the thIngs
I thInk about the most.

616
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:08,120
HavIng nothIng Ieft to Iose
Is freedom, I guess.

617
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:11,598
But I don't know
who can get to that poInt.

618
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:17,358
OK, it's 1917 or so.
We're in Vienna.

619
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:21,388
- There was our KarI.
- Who, the king?

620
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:24,989
- KarI.
- Right, we know him as the king.

621
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:27,709
The guy with the beard.
There was Frederick too.

622
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:32,434
Frederick Ieft his dad's factories
and came to join us.

623
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:37,755
The three of us were spinning
theories there in an attic flat.

624
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:42,148
- I won'tforget. We were havIng coffee..
- Who is this KarI?

625
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:44,630
A German footbaIIer, I think.

626
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:49,270
KarI Marx. Open a book
and read once in a whiIe.

627
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:54,910
I turned to KarI and said,
''What eIse do we have to Iose?''

628
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:57,798
You know what he said?

629
00:58:00,040 --> 00:58:03,669
''We have nothing to Iose
but our chains,'' he said. ''Kaan.''

630
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:07,359
''Fuck off,'' I said.

631
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:11,916
''With a mindset Iike that,'' I said,
''you'II screw up this century.''

632
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:13,912
''The century wiII faII apart,'' I said.

633
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,436
''There'II be a revoIution in Russia
any day,'' I said.

634
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:20,240
- WhIch In fact Is what happened.
- WeII, anyway..

635
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:25,238
Have a good night, Iistener.
Merry Christmas to you.

636
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:27,314
Bye then.

637
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:34,157
There's a Iistener on the Iine.

638
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:36,595
- HeIIo?
- EroI Egemen?

639
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:40,797
- Are you IIstenIng?
- Go ahead, Iistener.

640
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:42,919
Watch what you're sayIng.

641
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:46,593
How do you mean, Iistener?

642
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:51,079
Don't bItch about
peopIe's reIIgIon and faIth.

643
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:55,230
Know your pIace
or we'II put you In It.

644
00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:02,314
- How wiII you do that?
- You doubt my word?

645
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:05,950
- Sure.
- Don't.

646
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:09,274
I see you came to the radIo statIon
wIthout your motorbIke today.

647
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:17,715
Jerk.

648
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:23,789
- Hey, Iet's have a party, Mete.
- Good idea. Let's do it.

649
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:26,878
A IoneIy hearts party.
We're drying up here.

650
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:29,676
It'II energize us.

651
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:33,748
Let's do it on the 16th. At Trip bar.
Get a few friends aIong. We'II chiII.

652
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:36,068
It's a deaI.

653
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:10,192
- Jump in, guys. I'II take you these days.
- Thanks, JackaI.

654
01:01:58,520 --> 01:02:02,752
Ceyda, Murat, Zeynep.
Zeynep, Murat, Ceyda.

655
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:06,152
- HeIIo, everyone.
- Hi.

656
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:28,313
ShaII we grab some breakfast?

657
01:04:34,560 --> 01:04:35,629
C'mon then.

658
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:54,671
SHOP FOR RENT

659
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:09,835
Thanks.

660
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:17,119
I'II caII when I get back.

661
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:28,509
Go on, go.

662
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:44,155
Where have you been, Zeynep?

663
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:47,710
We've been waiting for you.
America's expecting news from you too.

664
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:52,269
Sorry, Mr. CemaI. I've faIIen in Iove.
I couIdn't sIeep aII night.

665
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:12,831
- Everyone's taIking about the show.
- I guess.

666
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:17,833
I don't get it. In the end,
what we do is hardIy popuIar cuIture.

667
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:19,593
That's for sure.

668
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:24,714
WeII? What do you say? Isn't it crazy
that it's caught on Iike this?

669
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:29,274
No idea. I thought about it too
whiIe I was Iistening the other day.

670
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:33,550
You taIk about things
no one dares to discuss openIy.

671
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:35,750
And that comes across as sincere.
Even if they don't understand...

672
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:40,873
...orfýnd it ridicuIous, I think
it's your sincerity that grabs them.

673
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:48,109
I reaIIy don't know.
I can't fýgure it out.

674
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:52,315
- Did anything come of those threats?
- No. It's just hot air.

675
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:57,873
- A coupIe of wackos who keep caIIing.
- StiII, don't wind them up. Be carefuI.

676
01:06:59,120 --> 01:07:02,192
- Don't worry.
- It's my job to worry.

677
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:09,078
I want to ask you something.

678
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:12,598
Do you think I Iead
a reaIIy empty Iife?

679
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:15,758
What do you think?

680
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:18,398
Don't know.. No.

681
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:24,431
I've aIways done what I've wanted.

682
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:26,558
The time came I went to EngIand.

683
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:30,993
The time came I got married.
The time came I had a chiId.

684
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:34,877
But I've done everything as I wanted
and at the time I wanted.

685
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:39,556
Sometimes I've paid a price for it,
but I've aIways Iived as I've wanted.

686
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:50,318
Not everyone is prepared
to pay that price.

687
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:05,391
- Isn't the missus coming?
- She's in Edirne with herfamiIy.

688
01:08:09,080 --> 01:08:10,593
Good Iuck, good Iuck!

689
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:25,673
- What the heII is this?
- Fuck!

690
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:30,153
Oh my god!

697
01:09:36,680 --> 01:09:38,193
Kaan. Kaan.

698
01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:47,157
- HeIIo. Have we had sex before?
- Take a hike, dumbass.

699
01:09:56,120 --> 01:09:56,870
What's up?

700
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:03,758
Mete, is it you?

701
01:10:05,080 --> 01:10:05,990

Who's EroI Egemen?

705
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:50,993
Who is it?
Who's this EroI Egemen?

706
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:56,150
- EroI Egemen's here. You heard?
- No way.

707
01:10:56,640 --> 01:10:58,790
My ass!
He's humping a girI in there.

- What do you want with Kaan and Mete?
- To join the Losers CIub.

732
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:04,033
- Yeah right.. Fine.
- Yes.

733
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:11,354
- Kaan's busy, kId.
- Is he in there? Can't we say heIIo?

734
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:14,990
Why can't we quickIy see him?
We want to join the CIub.

735
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:20,877
What cIub? What goddamn cIub?

736
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:23,999
- The Losers CIub.
- Fuck off! You fucking idiots...

737
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:39,195
- HeIIo?
- What are you up to?

738
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:43,191
Working. You?

739
01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:47,715
- Hey, Iet's go to OIympos.
- OK. Fine. When?

740
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:49,834
Now.

741
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:54,839
- You're kidding, right?
- No. I'II pick you up in an hour.

742
01:14:56,200 --> 01:15:00,318
- I'd Iove to, but I can't.
- You can't or you won't?

743
01:15:01,680 --> 01:15:04,399
I can't. I have a ton of work.
Are you OK?

744
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:08,555
I'm fýne. C'mon, we can reIax, have fun.
Besides, aII work and no pIay is not good.

745
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:12,593
- What's the worst that can happen?
- I'd get fýred.

746
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:14,672
You'd fýnd another job.

747
01:15:18,120 --> 01:15:20,236
I can't come. I've got
a piIe of projects to fýnish.

748
01:15:21,240 --> 01:15:24,676
- But I can break for coffee if you Iike.
- Forget it.

749
01:15:26,520 --> 01:15:29,478
- See you tonight.
- OK, see you then.

750
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:43,912
Yes, dear Iisteners.

751
01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:47,756
That brings us to the end of
tonight's edition of the Losers CIub.

752
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:51,790
EndIess thanks to you aII
for Iistening.

753
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:57,878
Keep heaIthy, happy and cheerfuI
untiI next week. Goodbye.

754
01:16:00,720 --> 01:16:03,393
Good night to you aII, dear Iisteners.

755
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:10,792
What are they doing in there?

756
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:15,831
They're recording a fake tape
for the state censor during music breaks.

757
01:16:17,200 --> 01:16:19,236
- We're done, boss.
- OK.

758
01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:26,393
- You know what just hit me, Mete?
- What?

759
01:16:27,240 --> 01:16:31,950
Censorship. Look, I think
everyone shouId be censored.

760
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:36,714
The state shouIdn't just censor
newspapers, TV and radio broadcasters.

761
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:39,588
They shouId censor magazines too,
even thoughts for that matter.

762
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:44,437
What buIIshit, everyone having
their own thoughts! Are we crazy?

763
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:50,836
For that matter, I say there shouId be
censorship spies out there. SeriousIy.

764
01:16:52,360 --> 01:16:56,478
I say radio fýnes aren't enough.
They shouId fýne thoughts as weII.

765
01:16:57,600 --> 01:17:03,197
Think of a woman? $1000.
Think of sex with that woman? $2000.

766
01:17:05,560 --> 01:17:07,596
Then we've earned a fortune
for the broadcasting authorities.

767
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:11,958
There's a Iistener on the Iine.

768
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:19,030
- HeIIo?
- HeIIo. HI.

769
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:25,589
- HeIIo. Have we had sex before?
- No! What a meanIngIess questIon.

770
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:31,474
OK, can you ask me a question
that isn't gratuitous?

771
01:17:31,960 --> 01:17:33,473
There's no such thIng.

772
01:17:33,960 --> 01:17:37,794
For starters anything without an answer
can't be a question.

773
01:17:38,720 --> 01:17:41,280
Questions onIy exist through
their desire to have an answer.

774
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:43,913
Except for one question.

775
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:49,678
This question might move you to
dead siIence or pure unbounded joy.

776
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:54,473
From what I understand, it couId
make you even more insufferabIe...

777
01:17:54,680 --> 01:17:57,877
...than you aIready are
to the peopIe around you.

778
01:17:58,120 --> 01:18:00,429
- If you're ready, I'II ask.
- Yes?

779
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:06,872
What couId be more serious
than death?

780
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:22,279
A caIIer on the Iine.

781
01:18:24,120 --> 01:18:27,157
- Goodnight, Iistener.
- Have we had sex before?

782
01:18:27,680 --> 01:18:30,558
- HeIIo?
- Night, Iistener. Go ahead

783
01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:32,713
My name's Hakan.

784
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:35,431
I've been thinking of caIIing
for quite a whiIe.

785
01:18:36,280 --> 01:18:38,555
But hearing what you've said tonight
I worked up the courage.

786
01:18:40,040 --> 01:18:42,315
Go ahead.
Take as Iong as you Iike.

787
01:18:43,080 --> 01:18:44,433
How to start?

788
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:48,034
I'm a painter.
I Iive with my mother.

789
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:53,316
Or rather, I used to.
I Iost my mother a year ago.

790
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:56,592
We were reaIIy cIose.

791
01:18:57,240 --> 01:18:59,117
It was she who got me into painting.

792
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:03,390
There's no sorrow.. No pain Iike it.

793
01:19:04,120 --> 01:19:05,872
I can't teII you.

794
01:19:07,280 --> 01:19:10,272
I couIdn't eat for months.
CouIdn't draw.

795
01:19:13,080 --> 01:19:15,036
In the end I couIdn't take it.

796
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:18,476
I thought, Iet me end it,
Iet me be spared this pain.

797
01:19:20,680 --> 01:19:22,636
I thought, no one wiII notice
my absence anyway.

798
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:25,796
I'd even fýxed the whoIe thing,
when and how I'd do it.

799
01:19:27,560 --> 01:19:29,232
It may sound crazy to you...

800
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:32,391
...but the night beforehand
I crossed your show.

801
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:36,232
I sat down and Iistened
right through to the end.

802
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:39,271
You did such a great job
Iaughing off IoneIiness.

803
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:43,955
I thought, I'II Iisten
the next night and then do it.

804
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,560
I didn't reaIize that I was
waiting for your show every night.

805
01:19:51,240 --> 01:19:53,515
And whiIe I waited
I forgot to die.

806
01:19:56,320 --> 01:19:58,629
I record the shows
and Iisten again during the day.

807
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:03,909
- Not every show presumabIy.
- WeII.. There's a few.

808
01:20:05,560 --> 01:20:07,790
I caIIed to thank you, actuaIIy.

809
01:20:14,280 --> 01:20:16,191
- Where are you caIIing from?
- Pendik.

810
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:19,429
In that case...

811
01:20:20,160 --> 01:20:25,029
...Iet's make you the Chief of Sorrow
for Pendik. If you agree, of course.

812
01:20:26,520 --> 01:20:27,669
Sure, Iove to.

813
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:31,472
OK then. Hey, we Iook forward
to hearing your reports now and again.

814
01:20:32,120 --> 01:20:33,758
Thanks for everything.

815
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:36,433
Good night.

816
01:20:51,960 --> 01:20:55,032
- Has EroI Egemen caIIed?
- Who is he anyway that he'd caII?

817
01:20:57,120 --> 01:20:58,712
ShaII we go grab some meatbaIIs?

818
01:21:00,440 --> 01:21:02,032
Yeah, c'mon. Let's go.

819
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:08,395
- Do you come here every night?
- Once a week. At Ieast.

820
01:21:09,080 --> 01:21:10,991
- Good?
- Great.

821
01:21:13,480 --> 01:21:15,436
Why didn't you spend Ionger
taIking to that caIIer?

822
01:21:18,360 --> 01:21:20,157
We taIked to him, right?
What eIse was there to say?

823
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:25,189
I don't know. He poured out his heart,
and thanked you.

824
01:21:27,720 --> 01:21:29,119
You couId have been
more sympathetic at Ieast.

825
01:21:30,840 --> 01:21:32,193
That's what you think.

826
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:34,712
I don't get it. You don't
appreciate anything you have.

827
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:38,192
Why don't you take anything seriousIy?

828
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:41,956
Why do you aIways want us to be on a mission?

829
01:21:43,520 --> 01:21:46,398
We're just two guys who taIk on air
and enjoy each other's company.

830
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:48,589
That's aII.

831
01:21:49,680 --> 01:21:52,240
I know damn weII you don't
reaIIy beIieve what you just said.

832
01:21:54,640 --> 01:21:57,757
We didn't ask anyone to Iisten,
or to Iike the show...

833
01:21:57,920 --> 01:21:59,558
...or to take us seriousIy.

834
01:22:00,720 --> 01:22:03,553
But they have taken you seriousIy.
What are you going to do now?

835
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:06,911
Finish our meatbaIIs and go home.

836
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:08,999
Same.

837
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:31,633
I just don't get it.

838
01:22:34,680 --> 01:22:39,708
The show's this popuIar, fuck it,
and we're stiII not seIIing books.

839
01:22:41,440 --> 01:22:45,115
I wish it was some use to us, fuck it.

840
01:22:45,480 --> 01:22:48,119
But Kaan doesn't want to use the show.

841
01:22:49,080 --> 01:22:53,517
WeII, I wouIdn't know about that.
But this show changed my Iife.

842
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:56,435
It saved me, I'm teIIing you.

843
01:22:57,520 --> 01:22:59,829
No one had any idea
it wouId get this far.

844
01:23:02,120 --> 01:23:06,159
You know what?
What we have now wiII end one day.

845
01:23:06,600 --> 01:23:08,636
We'II miss these days.

846
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:13,229
I don't know.
Maybe other things wiII start.

847
01:23:16,240 --> 01:23:18,674
Maybe this was our own revoIution.

848
01:23:24,760 --> 01:23:27,228
- Beer?
- Okay

849
01:23:42,120 --> 01:23:43,712
- Hi, Kaan.
- Hi.

850
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:45,593
- How are you?
- Good. You?

851
01:23:46,080 --> 01:23:47,274
I'm good too.

852
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:18,793
What time is it?

853
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:22,033
10.00.

854
01:24:24,160 --> 01:24:25,593
Uh-oh!

855
01:24:27,280 --> 01:24:29,714
- What's up?
- I have to meet my parents.

856
01:24:30,120 --> 01:24:32,429
They're dropping by
on theirway to Edirne.

857
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:35,478
- CaII and say you'II be Iate.
- Can't. They'II be disappointed.

858
01:24:39,960 --> 01:24:42,838
- What are you doing?
- I'II drop you off. It'II be faster.

859
01:24:43,320 --> 01:24:46,198
- No need. I'II fýnd my way.
- Aren't they coming into Harem?

860
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:48,915
- I'II drop you.
- Kaan, I said no need. I'm fýne.

861
01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:52,474
OK, I'm out of here.
See you tonight at the studio.

862
01:24:52,680 --> 01:24:55,752
- The studio?
- I toId you, my friend wants to come.

863
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:07,518
Up to now, I've beIieved in everything
I wanted to beIieve in, Kaan.

864
01:25:08,240 --> 01:25:11,994
Though I know that in the end
I'II die, that I'II suffer...

865
01:25:13,080 --> 01:25:14,957
...I've beIieved in
everything I wanted to.

866
01:25:16,200 --> 01:25:20,113
And whenever I've feIt cIose to
achieving something, I've Iost it.

867
01:25:20,640 --> 01:25:21,709
You mean you're a dodo.

868
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:24,555
Yes.

869
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:28,669
In that case,
we're reading a poem.

870
01:25:37,560 --> 01:25:39,596
Dodo bird isIand excrement..

871
01:25:40,160 --> 01:25:43,835
Dodo bird dust and sorrow Iurking
in the shade of berry bushes..

872
01:25:44,520 --> 01:25:48,433
- Wash, those dear tears..
- Wow..

873
01:25:49,240 --> 01:25:53,552
- Your hooded eye, stormy shores..
- Wow.

874
01:25:56,080 --> 01:25:59,197
Canyon-Iike river..

875
01:26:00,720 --> 01:26:05,589
Linger on, deep in sIeep
SIeep. eeppp. eeeppp.

876
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:08,313
My goodness.

877
01:26:08,520 --> 01:26:09,748
SmiIe from earth and sky.

878
01:26:09,960 --> 01:26:13,999
I Iook through your sapphire eyes
FaIIing into the trap ap. ap. ap...

879
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:21,232
My heart, Iike faIIing wiId horses,
diary of Iove.. ove. ove..

880
01:26:23,200 --> 01:26:26,556
Dodo bird, oh, obIivious to the gazeIIe,
echoing caII in my brain..

881
01:26:26,760 --> 01:26:28,716
- Understand any of this?
- No.

882
01:26:29,440 --> 01:26:32,318
My breast, trembIing,
with wounded waters..

883
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:35,477
My goodness.

884
01:26:40,280 --> 01:26:42,111
Here we go.

885
01:26:43,360 --> 01:26:45,191
Here we go, wow.

886
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:48,631
Instant death..

887
01:26:50,200 --> 01:26:54,830
ObIivious to the gazeIIe, echoing caII
in your eye, Iake tremors..

888
01:26:55,200 --> 01:26:58,431
- Dodo bird..
- With bIoody waters..

889
01:26:58,600 --> 01:27:01,433
- Echoing in my brain..
- Dodo bird..

890
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:07,394
Of my breast with bIoody waters!
Dust peace sorrow Iurk in the shadows..

891
01:27:07,720 --> 01:27:08,948
Here we go.

892
01:27:10,480 --> 01:27:14,109
Water! MoonIess night
trembIing grains of sand..

893
01:27:15,320 --> 01:27:18,596
BehoId the muIIet and wiId oIeander
BehoId the coming bastard. He'II be born..

894
01:27:18,880 --> 01:27:21,348
- Wow.
- My goodness.

895
01:27:23,040 --> 01:27:24,519
Yeehah!

896
01:27:38,120 --> 01:27:42,591
- Are you guys the onIy ones here at night?
- And Header, that's aII.

897
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:46,752
Yourface is famiIiar. Have we met?

898
01:27:50,200 --> 01:27:52,953
Kaan, why are you presenting
the show Iike that?

899
01:27:53,800 --> 01:27:55,153
Why shouIdn't I?

900
01:27:56,080 --> 01:27:57,433
It's kind of weird, isn't it?

901
01:27:59,880 --> 01:28:03,919
My jeans get kind of tight
after eating so I take them off.

902
01:28:05,360 --> 01:28:06,679
Interesting.

903
01:28:08,480 --> 01:28:09,754
It's no big deaI.

904
01:28:12,200 --> 01:28:13,474
C'mon, Iet's go.

905
01:28:18,600 --> 01:28:19,919
You fýrst.

906
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:27,110
If that vase rotates one more time
I'II sIash my wrists.

907
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:33,035
- How many times have you watched this?
- Two or three.

908
01:28:33,800 --> 01:28:37,076
No.. Four.

909
01:28:37,320 --> 01:28:39,231
Zeynep, carefuI.
Don't spiII it on the carpet.

910
01:28:40,600 --> 01:28:41,953
Don't worry.

911
01:28:43,080 --> 01:28:45,992
- Four, fýve..
- It's a piIe of shit.

912
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:50,115
- Zeynep, carefuI!
- Eight, nine times.

913
01:28:54,720 --> 01:28:58,474
Hey, didn't I say not to spiII it?
That carpet's speciaI.

914
01:29:05,360 --> 01:29:07,749
I've watched it 13-14 times.

915
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:10,989
Sorry.

916
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:14,399
Or is it 15?
I don't remember exactIy.

917
01:29:16,280 --> 01:29:19,636
- Kaan says a big heIIo to you.
- How is he? OK?

918
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:21,672
Same as ever.

919
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:26,232
I have something to give you.

920
01:29:31,360 --> 01:29:33,112
These are for you.

921
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:48,273
- I don't understand.
- Most are originaIs. First edition.

922
01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:52,678
Mum, these are something eIse.
Where did you fýnd them?

923
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:56,634
I got them in EngIand.
I've had them stashed away for ages.

924
01:29:57,480 --> 01:29:59,118
You can put them in your store.

925
01:30:00,480 --> 01:30:02,118
In the store?

926
01:30:03,280 --> 01:30:04,918
Did you think
I wouIdn't fýnd out?

927
01:30:09,520 --> 01:30:10,635
Thanks.

928
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:13,389
Come in.

929
01:30:19,480 --> 01:30:20,754
- Miss AsIý.
- Yes?

930
01:30:22,840 --> 01:30:24,068
Another penaIty?

931
01:30:25,200 --> 01:30:27,555
- They're up to number one.
- No surprises.

932
01:30:28,120 --> 01:30:30,475
They've been number two
in their time sIot for a whiIe.

933
01:30:31,160 --> 01:30:34,914
It's not just in their time sIot.
They're number one for the whoIe day.

934
01:30:39,680 --> 01:30:40,954
NO.1 LOSERS CLUB/KENTFM/8. 70/25.10

935
01:30:41,880 --> 01:30:43,074
We're done for.

936
01:30:45,560 --> 01:30:49,872
We need to ask you a question
for you to win the book.

937
01:30:50,440 --> 01:30:52,874
What's the fuII name
of the Tennessee team...

938
01:30:53,080 --> 01:30:55,548
...that pIayed in this year's
Super BowI fýnaI?

939
01:30:56,680 --> 01:31:00,275
No! If I say I don't know, I'II Iose.
PIease don't ask.

940
01:31:00,600 --> 01:31:03,956
- Good system. I IIke It.
- Oh, god. PIease.

941
01:31:04,160 --> 01:31:06,913
- Sure, sure. It's aIIowed.
- Then Iet's ask another question.

942
01:31:07,200 --> 01:31:11,239
No, I don'twant to Iose thIs.
Or suppose you ask another tIme?

943
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:15,274
I mean, any questIon you IIke.
If you gave me the book tonIght, say.

944
01:31:15,400 --> 01:31:18,153
Have we sIept together?
Your voice sounds famiIiar.

945
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:19,230
ItwouId.

946
01:31:19,680 --> 01:31:22,399
- But we've never sIept together.
- SeriousIy, you haven't?

947
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:25,711
- We've taIked, but not sIept together.
- Fine. One of us wiII anyway

948
01:31:26,600 --> 01:31:28,795
Why make such a big deaI?
I'm stressed, don't harass me.

949
01:31:28,960 --> 01:31:31,713
HeIIo? HeIIo?
Where shouId I come?

950
01:32:00,880 --> 01:32:01,915
Where were you?

951
01:32:06,080 --> 01:32:08,594
- I went to Hakký's pIace with Mete.
- Hakký was that important, huh?

952
01:32:08,760 --> 01:32:12,389
- You knew I'd be staying over tonight.
- I'm here, aren't I, Zeynep?

953
01:32:12,480 --> 01:32:14,357
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

954
01:32:21,040 --> 01:32:23,110
Why do you make out with
every femaIe caIIer on the show?

955
01:32:25,280 --> 01:32:27,396
- Don't be ridicuIous.
- It's me being ridicuIous, is it?

956
01:32:28,240 --> 01:32:30,629
You're the one who constantIy
taIks about sex every night on the air.

957
01:32:30,960 --> 01:32:33,428
Have we sIept together? Come over.
Let me Iick you.. And aII that.

958
01:32:34,840 --> 01:32:36,592
Is that what you think
the show's about?

959
01:32:36,720 --> 01:32:39,075
- That we don't taIk about anything eIse?
- Do you?

960
01:32:41,040 --> 01:32:43,349
OK. No, we don't.

961
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,958
Suppose I introduced you to my dad
and he heard you on the radio?

962
01:32:49,080 --> 01:32:51,435
- What wouId I say?
- Then don't introduce me.

963
01:32:51,560 --> 01:32:52,913
- Why are you pushing it?
- Look..

964
01:32:57,120 --> 01:33:01,193
You're the smartest,
most knowIedgeabIe guy I know.

965
01:33:01,440 --> 01:33:04,352
Why do you waste it? Why don't you
do something that gets you somewhere?

966
01:33:07,320 --> 01:33:09,709
Don't beIieve this.. In the beginning,
everything I did excited you.

967
01:33:09,920 --> 01:33:12,992
Your books don't seII. You turn down
money from the radio station.

968
01:33:13,200 --> 01:33:15,919
You take photos now and again.
Why don't you do something proper?

969
01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:17,639
You're not 19 any Ionger.

970
01:33:28,600 --> 01:33:30,909
This is who I am.
I've never hidden it.

971
01:33:32,440 --> 01:33:35,273
I've never Iied to you.
I haven't changed.

972
01:33:37,360 --> 01:33:41,319
If you aren't happy.. I mean,
if I'm not good enough for you...

973
01:33:43,160 --> 01:33:44,991
...you can fuck off.

974
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:50,989
What then?

975
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:56,119
Nothing. She didn't smiIe.
Not at aII.

976
01:34:57,080 --> 01:35:01,039
It was Iike she couIdn't smiIe.

977
01:35:02,480 --> 01:35:06,996
Yet in the sky there was everything
you couId expect from a good sunset.

978
01:35:07,880 --> 01:35:11,793
AII those warm coIours,
a gentIe breeze.

979
01:35:17,160 --> 01:35:18,991
The smeII of her perfume.

980
01:35:20,640 --> 01:35:25,873
If at that moment
an anviI had faIIen from the sky...

981
01:35:26,840 --> 01:35:30,913
...it wouId have taken it
nine days and nights to reach earth.

982
01:35:32,480 --> 01:35:35,756
I've had a job offerfrom America
that I'd been expecting.

983
01:35:39,920 --> 01:35:40,955
CongratuIations.

984
01:35:48,080 --> 01:35:50,071
I can't decide whether to go or not.

985
01:35:54,080 --> 01:35:55,115
Why?

986
01:36:01,720 --> 01:36:03,073
It kind of depends on you.

987
01:36:12,440 --> 01:36:16,194
If you say, ''Don't go,''
I won't.

988
01:36:18,200 --> 01:36:20,350
We'II give it a shot here, but..

989
01:36:27,520 --> 01:36:29,715
But you have to teII me that.

990
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:35,709
TeII me not to go.

991
01:36:41,360 --> 01:36:42,554
Can you?

992
01:36:47,880 --> 01:36:49,029
TeII me not to go.

993
01:37:34,640 --> 01:37:40,749
If at that moment a bronze anviI
had faIIen from earth...

994
01:37:40,920 --> 01:37:46,313
...it wouId have taken it
nine days and nights to reach her eyes.

995
01:37:48,440 --> 01:37:55,790
A Iong, drawn out..
dark.. coId moment.

996
01:37:59,200 --> 01:38:01,714
TruIy, that's how it was.

997
01:40:20,560 --> 01:40:21,754
Thanks.

998
01:40:26,920 --> 01:40:28,114
You OK?

999
01:40:31,080 --> 01:40:32,479
Yeah, I'm doing better these days.

1000
01:40:34,080 --> 01:40:37,550
- Have you heard from Zeynep?
- We spoke at some point.

1001
01:40:40,240 --> 01:40:41,719
She's settIed in America.

1002
01:40:51,360 --> 01:40:55,035
I guess with aII the rockin' n roIIin'
I didn't reaIize I was so in Iove

1003
01:40:56,840 --> 01:40:58,273
But it wouIdn't have worked anyway.

1004
01:41:00,360 --> 01:41:01,679
Forget it, boss.

1005
01:41:07,160 --> 01:41:08,479
You know what's the probIem with women?

1006
01:41:10,760 --> 01:41:12,910
They faII in Iove with the quaIities
that make you who you are...

1007
01:41:14,160 --> 01:41:16,310
...and then try to take them away from you.

1008
01:41:21,760 --> 01:41:23,910
- How's the store?
- Good.

1009
01:41:28,640 --> 01:41:34,078
I say I shouId focus more
on the pubIishing business.

1010
01:41:38,720 --> 01:41:41,234
I reckon it's time for a change, huh?

1011
01:41:50,880 --> 01:41:52,598
What are we going to teII AsIý?

1012
01:41:54,520 --> 01:41:56,158
We'II fýnd something.

1013
01:42:12,240 --> 01:42:13,639
What's up?

1014
01:42:16,600 --> 01:42:18,955
Ceyda.. She's Ieft me.

1015
01:42:20,600 --> 01:42:22,397
You mean you were together?

1016
01:42:22,880 --> 01:42:25,792
We were madIy in Iove.
You didn't notice?

1017
01:42:27,280 --> 01:42:29,475
Sorry.
Hey, what's this?

1018
01:42:31,200 --> 01:42:33,953
I thought we shouId have dinner,
the two of us, as singIe guys.

1019
01:42:34,760 --> 01:42:39,276
I got ice cream too. Raspberry.
And I fýnished the transIation.

1020
01:42:42,760 --> 01:42:43,715
Are you OK?

1021
01:42:45,120 --> 01:42:48,476
Like you say..
It's no joke, we're totaIIy aIone.

1022
01:43:07,280 --> 01:43:11,751
Hey, is this fair? Is this justice?
Mete, Iet's hear a message of justice.

1023
01:43:12,640 --> 01:43:16,394
What justice?
You mean there's justice?

1024
01:43:16,800 --> 01:43:18,916

1026

Speak of Iove, brotherhood,

1027
01:43:27,120 --> 01:43:30,396
OK, Iet's Iove fairIy.

1028
01:43:30,760 --> 01:43:35,231
Let's want whoeverwants us,

1029
01:43:35,960 --> 01:43:40,238

Maybe we'II Iove with time.
That's what I'm saying.

1032
01:43:50,200 --> 01:43:54,796
Nice words. Nice words.
Look, I have tears in my eyes.

1033
01:43:56,240 --> 01:44:00,870

1041
01:44:37,440 --> 01:44:40,796

1042
01:44:40,880 --> 01:44:43,394

1043
01:44:51,880 --> 01:44:55,998
As aIways, Kent Iisteners, we dedicate
this edition of the Losers CIub...

1044
01:44:57,600 --> 01:45:00,910
...to the Montana gang,
to the bad kids in town...

1045
01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:05,558
...to the headIine-grabbing,
EroI Egemen Syndrome...

1046
01:45:05,640 --> 01:45:08,473
...which has taken
the medicaI worId by storm...

1047
01:45:08,800 --> 01:45:11,997
...to aII eviI spirits,
and to the streets of Kadýköy...

1048
01:45:12,120 --> 01:45:14,873
...where we're stiII Iearning
about Iife and women.

1049
01:45:15,960 --> 01:45:18,713
And we make this dedication
without the sIightest hesitation.

1050
01:45:20,560 --> 01:45:24,792
We won't be with you next Tuesday
or any other night thereafter.

1051
01:45:25,880 --> 01:45:31,398
This, and aII other editions of the Losers CIub,
have come to an end...

1052
01:45:37,520 --> 01:45:40,751
We wish you aII a good night,
Kent Iisteners.

1053
01:45:41,480 --> 01:45:44,040
If, of course, that's possibIe.

1054
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:46,479
Goodbye.

1055
01:45:47,400 --> 01:45:49,755
The Losers CIub is over.

1056
01:45:57,720 --> 01:46:02,748
Even If I'm wIth you, my Iove

1057
01:46:04,960 --> 01:46:10,637
Even If we part or dIe
on thIs road

1058
01:46:12,760 --> 01:46:18,437
It's always IoneIIness, sweetheart,

1059
01:46:19,880 --> 01:46:24,556

Even If I'm wIth you, my Iove

Even If we see nothIng of each other

01:46:36,280 --> 01:46:38,555
If we mIss one another

1063
01:46:40,080 --> 01:46:45,234
Even If we're together forever
If we're happy or sad

1064
01:46:46,600 --> 01:46:51,799
It's IoneIIness for IIfe

1065
01:46:52,240 --> 01:46:57,439
If I suddenIy thInk of you,
If I forget you now and agaIn

1066
01:46:57,720 --> 01:47:02,919
