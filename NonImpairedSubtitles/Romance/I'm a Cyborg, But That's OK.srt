21
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:08,790
Young-goon before the incident?

Costume Design : CHO Sang-kyung

23
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,810
For instance, did she stop
eating suddenly?

24
00:02:10,943 --> 00:02:15,700
I'm afraid I didn't have time
to notice things like that

25
00:02:16,991 --> 00:02:19,260
I'm so busy at the restaurant.

Visual Effects : LEE Zeon-hyoung

27
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,422
Truth is, my mother
was raised by Young-goon.

28
00:02:26,751 --> 00:02:27,864
Pardon me?

29
00:02:27,999 --> 00:02:34,196
No, I mean, my mother
raised Young-goon.

30
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,331
- That's why the young one talks
- Three, push metal plate 2 x 23 in...

31
00:02:38,463 --> 00:02:42,457
rather like an old person.
- and set it on the back case

32
00:02:43,167 --> 00:02:45,720
Could I meet her grandmother?

Editors : KIM Sang-bum, KIM Jae-bum

34
00:02:45,855 --> 00:02:48,889
She went to a home for Alzheimer's.

35
00:02:49,023 --> 00:02:51,292
She ate nothing but radish
for six months.

36
00:02:53,727 --> 00:02:56,826
- Radish?
- Like for pickled radishes.

37
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,807
- Bolt 1.7 x 4
- I see.

38
00:03:03,775 --> 00:03:04,985
Yes?

39
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:11,514
70kg of tripe, did you get
the head meat, ears, liver, and womb?

40
00:03:12,031 --> 00:03:16,985
No, we need to get at least 100kg.
You know it's hard to get nowadays.

41
00:03:18,847 --> 00:03:20,254
When I was young,

42
00:03:20,384 --> 00:03:24,093
Once when I was little, I came home
early from school with a bad headache.

43
00:03:24,224 --> 00:03:27,257
- A head?
- Yeah, head meat.

44
00:03:27,391 --> 00:03:30,293
No, get 60kg of tongue.

45
00:03:31,007 --> 00:03:32,217
Yeah.

46
00:03:34,943 --> 00:03:40,759
It hurt so much that
as soon as I got home...

47
00:03:40,896 --> 00:03:42,968
I started calling from the yard!

48
00:03:44,832 --> 00:03:46,141
Mom!

49
00:03:48,095 --> 00:03:49,404
Mom!

50
00:03:54,047 --> 00:03:56,502
<i>Five, fasten the insulator to
the speaker on the front case...</i>

51
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:01,080
Insulator, speaker, front case,
assemble the circuit board...

52
00:04:01,215 --> 00:04:02,906
- What are you doing?
- Back case...

53
00:04:04,288 --> 00:04:06,459
Volume...

54
00:04:06,591 --> 00:04:10,781
Bolts 2 x 8, fasten...

55
00:04:13,792 --> 00:04:15,199
She was...

56
00:04:16,095 --> 00:04:17,983
Feeding some mice.

57
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:21,340
<i>Six,</i>

58
00:04:21,472 --> 00:04:24,701
<i>Connect the tester and
switch on the radio.</i>

59
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:26,522
Switch of radio.

60
00:04:27,232 --> 00:04:30,941
To the home for eating radishes, too?

61
00:04:31,072 --> 00:04:34,454
The smell was really bad
whenever she ate radishes.

62
00:04:34,591 --> 00:04:35,802
10 to 25...

63
00:04:35,935 --> 00:04:38,302
- Were they pet mice?
- Normal.

64
00:04:38,431 --> 00:04:40,319
They were strangers to me.

65
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:43,481
<i>- Seven, once the check is done...</i>
- The check.

66
00:04:43,615 --> 00:04:45,687
<i>- Pull the antenna up high...</i>
- The Antenna.

67
00:04:45,824 --> 00:04:48,857
<i>Turn the frequency knob to find
a broadcaststation.</i>

68
00:04:48,991 --> 00:04:51,926
Broadcast, brooadcast.

69
00:04:52,063 --> 00:04:57,114
<i>Eight, split the end of the wire
in two and take of the covering</i>

70
00:04:57,247 --> 00:04:59,221
My mother told me.

71
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,010
She had a secret that
she really shouldn't tell.

72
00:05:02,144 --> 00:05:04,282
But she didn't want
to hide it anymore

73
00:05:04,416 --> 00:05:07,831
That those mice were
my little brothers and sisters.

74
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:12,157
"As much as you're my daughter,
so are these mice."

75
00:05:13,151 --> 00:05:16,283
"I am the mother mouse."

76
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:20,990
- I see.
<i>- Nine</i>

77
00:05:21,503 --> 00:05:25,780
<i>- Cut left wrist with knife...</i>
- Wrist... knife...

78
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:30,782
My poor mother.

79
00:05:31,391 --> 00:05:32,602
Mother was always so timid...

80
00:05:32,735 --> 00:05:36,412
<i>- Put in the uncovered wires...</i>
- Wires...

81
00:05:36,543 --> 00:05:38,901
Did Young-goon know about
her grandmother's story, too?

82
00:05:37,695 --> 00:05:38,906
<i>Bind it with duct tape.</i>

83
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:40,926
- Young-goon?
- Tape.

84
00:05:41,055 --> 00:05:42,549
Of course not.

85
00:05:44,032 --> 00:05:48,985
Mother probably felt a little
closer to the mice that day.

86
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:55,129
To the pig intestines, too.

87
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:59,734
With your patients?

88
00:06:04,575 --> 00:06:08,536
<i>Ten, plug into an outlet.</i>

89
00:06:08,671 --> 00:06:09,784
Plug.

90
00:06:14,623 --> 00:06:17,373
Did Young-goon ever say

91
00:06:17,503 --> 00:06:18,997
she was something else, too?

92
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:20,542
Never, doctor.

93
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,734
Young-goon is a human being.

94
00:06:30,175 --> 00:06:34,452
Her grandmother's thing
wouldn't have much to do...

95
00:06:35,264 --> 00:06:37,052
with Young-goon's trying
to commit suicide, would it?

96
00:06:41,951 --> 00:06:46,708
My girl will be okay, right?

97
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,982
I wonder if a kid like you
could take the food here.

98
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:16,920
What could your parents
be thinking of, sending you here?

99
00:07:17,823 --> 00:07:20,474
After all, parents are always
the most important factor.

100
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:24,790
For girls,
it's especially the father.

101
00:07:26,271 --> 00:07:27,678
Like for her over there.

102
00:07:34,239 --> 00:07:37,654
They say 10 years ago,
a patient disappeared.

103
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:42,548
His name was Oh Dong-soo and
he was thin and pale like rice paper.

104
00:07:42,687 --> 00:07:45,404
And he was plagued
by non-stop hiccups.

105
00:07:45,823 --> 00:07:49,139
The staff, the military and police,
they searched everywhere for him

106
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:52,891
They even had the hounds up
in the mountains.

107
00:07:54,463 --> 00:07:56,732
Said he was a dangerous psychopath.

108
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:03,161
About a week went by...

109
00:08:03,295 --> 00:08:08,052
before they realized this clock
was making hiccupping sounds

110
00:08:08,671 --> 00:08:15,065
He was comfortably
curled up in here, dead.

111
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:17,333
Listen.

112
00:08:20,063 --> 00:08:21,372
That sound.

113
00:08:23,135 --> 00:08:25,404
I can't live
like this anymore.

114
00:08:25,535 --> 00:08:28,568
Come over here.
Look at here.

115
00:08:28,703 --> 00:08:30,110
Believe it or not, kid.

116
00:08:30,239 --> 00:08:32,508
This is crazy!

117
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:34,811
- Listen everyone, this is insane!
- Dae-pyong, calm down!

118
00:08:34,943 --> 00:08:37,878
Who put you up to this?
You thieving bastards!

119
00:08:38,015 --> 00:08:41,528
How dare you imprison a police
officer on duty! Bastards!

120
00:08:41,663 --> 00:08:43,932
- Catch Park Il-soon!
- Calm down! Dae-pyong, please!

121
00:08:44,063 --> 00:08:46,135
- Calm down!
- Police!

122
00:08:46,751 --> 00:08:48,606
911!

123
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:51,189
Dr. Kim!

124
00:08:51,327 --> 00:08:53,596
He did it again.

125
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:58,775
A police officer?
Who is he kidding?

126
00:08:58,911 --> 00:09:00,504
He's just a uniform freak.

127
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:05,302
He put on a schoolgirl uniform,
killed his wife...

128
00:09:05,439 --> 00:09:06,933
and burned his house down.

129
00:09:08,127 --> 00:09:09,818
Let's change the subject.

130
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:15,002
That guy in the mask, they say
he used to be really handsome.

131
00:09:15,135 --> 00:09:19,128
But after he was gang raped
in the army, he went mad.

132
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:27,931
He blamed his handsome face and
burned it with cigarette butts.

133
00:09:29,023 --> 00:09:36,661
Then he sewed up his own anus.

134
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:42,812
That man over there.

135
00:09:43,615 --> 00:09:46,266
He's a farmer from Kyung-san.

136
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:49,814
A nice, quiet bachelor all his life,

137
00:09:49,951 --> 00:09:52,372
good to everyone in the village.

138
00:09:52,511 --> 00:09:57,367
But he fell in love with a calf
that he delivered himself.

139
00:09:57,503 --> 00:10:00,253
Its name was Jenny, I think.

140
00:10:00,383 --> 00:10:03,416
He brought it into his room to live.

141
00:10:03,551 --> 00:10:08,308
It couldn't talk, didn't have hands,
but he would wash its face.

142
00:10:08,447 --> 00:10:10,519
And listened to the radio with it,
and soon.

143
00:10:10,655 --> 00:10:14,365
The town folk thought he was a freak
and had him put in here.

144
00:10:15,071 --> 00:10:20,788
But he really only loved
Jenny platonically.

145
00:10:31,647 --> 00:10:32,759
I'm depressed.

146
00:10:42,783 --> 00:10:45,336
Who's this chick?

147
00:10:47,103 --> 00:10:48,313
Huh?

148
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:51,672
I don't know.

149
00:10:57,246 --> 00:11:01,436
Sul-mi! You're not supposed to
take a patient around like this.

150
00:11:02,719 --> 00:11:06,428
Not my fault.
Someone left her with me.

151
00:11:07,615 --> 00:11:10,070
Don't be that way with me, doctor!

152
00:11:10,495 --> 00:11:15,066
You know I'm sick! You shouldn't
embarrass me like this.

153
00:11:21,535 --> 00:11:24,950
Did she tell you many stories,
Young-goon?

154
00:11:25,086 --> 00:11:27,421
The things she tells you...

155
00:11:27,551 --> 00:11:29,624
That's right! They're all lies!

156
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:36,349
Yes, they're all lies.
It's called mythomania.

157
00:11:36,479 --> 00:11:39,326
She has an illness that makes her
tell tall tales.

158
00:11:39,455 --> 00:11:43,546
She loses all her memory each time
she gets shock therapy

159
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:47,574
So she makes up stories to
take the place of her memories.

160
00:12:11,871 --> 00:12:12,984
What's wrong?

161
00:12:13,119 --> 00:12:14,908
She won't talk.

162
00:12:15,518 --> 00:12:17,493
Psychotic depression?

163
00:12:17,631 --> 00:12:21,428
Her grandmother was schizophrenic.
Thought she was a mouse.

164
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:24,699
Was she afraid of her mother-in-law?

165
00:12:24,831 --> 00:12:26,041
How'd you know that?

166
00:12:26,943 --> 00:12:28,437
I once saw...

167
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:32,541
Two patients who thought
they were mice.

168
00:12:33,535 --> 00:12:35,607
They both said they were afraid
of their mothers-in-law.

169
00:12:37,471 --> 00:12:39,642
I don't know where to start with her.

170
00:12:39,774 --> 00:12:42,141
She won't stir a finger.

171
00:12:42,271 --> 00:12:44,059
Her eyes are out of focus.

172
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:21,086
Hey kids!

173
00:13:21,695 --> 00:13:25,110
I'm here. You fluorescent lights.

174
00:13:26,111 --> 00:13:28,860
No use pretending
you don't understand me.

175
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:34,430
Lights here aren't very friendly,
are they?

176
00:13:36,447 --> 00:13:41,979
No matter how tired you are,
it's bad manners not to say hello.

177
00:13:42,782 --> 00:13:45,630
How are you,
after working all day?

178
00:13:57,182 --> 00:13:58,971
Really?

179
00:13:59,294 --> 00:14:00,505
Then...

180
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,486
Perhaps some adlay tea, please?

181
00:14:35,647 --> 00:14:37,240
Thank you kindly.

182
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:53,340
Maybe the lights in the wards
will be friendlier.

183
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:54,965
Since they rest at night.

184
00:14:55,967 --> 00:14:59,480
So you knew from the beginning
that you're a light?

185
00:15:02,687 --> 00:15:05,916
I only found out later in life
that I'm a cyborg.

186
00:15:07,102 --> 00:15:11,357
The white 'uns came and took
my granny away in an ambulance.

187
00:15:12,158 --> 00:15:13,751
You know the white 'uns!

188
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:16,053
They're all over the place here.

189
00:15:16,191 --> 00:15:19,803
They wear white-doctors, nurses...

190
00:15:19,934 --> 00:15:21,144
Granny!

191
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:23,253
Right, and orderlies!

192
00:15:24,063 --> 00:15:25,754
- She took the radish.
- Granny!

193
00:15:25,887 --> 00:15:28,538
But left her dentures.
So I ran after her with them.

194
00:15:29,246 --> 00:15:33,240
Granny needs them to eat radish.
She's a mouse, you know.

195
00:15:34,719 --> 00:15:37,850
Just then, a bike came up
and took me.

196
00:15:39,615 --> 00:15:43,193
But a bike can't beat an ambulance.

197
00:15:43,326 --> 00:15:45,301
Even a kid in knickers knows that.

198
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:49,907
So I bawled and you know
what the bike said?

199
00:15:50,046 --> 00:15:52,697
"A cyborg can beat anything."

200
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:55,580
"How come you don't know that
when you're a cyborg yourself?"

201
00:15:56,766 --> 00:15:59,897
So I had to pretend
I had always known.

202
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:05,464
But the problem was I couldn't
catch up to the ambulance for real.

203
00:16:06,463 --> 00:16:10,653
So, ask me what I said
to the bike then.

204
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:15,421
"Confounded fool,
I'm all out of battery, you moron."

205
00:16:16,319 --> 00:16:18,294
So I endeavored to recharge
by listening

206
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:20,984
to educational broadcasts
at the factory.

207
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:25,690
I'm only fully recharged
when it lights up to here.

208
00:16:25,822 --> 00:16:28,953
But look, I'm almost on empty.

209
00:16:31,486 --> 00:16:37,116
I did as the broadcast told me,
and the ambulance brought me here.

210
00:16:38,495 --> 00:16:40,470
I'm a machine, but...

211
00:16:40,607 --> 00:16:45,658
I didn't come with an instruction
manual or a label on me anywhere.

212
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:50,232
I still don't know what my purpose is.

213
00:16:51,134 --> 00:16:53,021
What was I made for?

214
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:02,614
You didn't eat your lunch, did you?

215
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:09,722
You won't be able to starve
yourself to death that way.

216
00:17:11,102 --> 00:17:15,575
The cafeteria ladies keep tabs
on everything you eat.

217
00:17:17,247 --> 00:17:20,629
A girl like you once tried
to starve herself to death.

218
00:17:20,767 --> 00:17:22,741
She was so enthusiastic.

219
00:17:24,511 --> 00:17:29,748
But hospitals have
force-feeding machines.

220
00:17:31,422 --> 00:17:37,139
Doctors and professors meet
to confer on how to feed you...

221
00:17:39,198 --> 00:17:45,493
It's embarrassing to have them force
food up your nose in front of people.

222
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:51,227
So that girl is still eating,
and alive and kicking.

223
00:17:52,126 --> 00:17:53,719
Sad, isn't it?

224
00:17:54,814 --> 00:17:56,407
So I was thinking...

225
00:17:57,790 --> 00:18:00,725
Want me to help you?

226
00:18:50,367 --> 00:18:53,596
Broadcast, broadcast!

227
00:18:53,726 --> 00:18:56,443
Brooadcast!

228
00:19:09,342 --> 00:19:13,815
Listen. There are some
really good messages.

229
00:19:24,223 --> 00:19:26,110
<i>Time for meditation.</i>

230
00:19:27,647 --> 00:19:33,178
<i>Get up and listen to the hum of
the fridge in the middle of night.</i>

231
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,725
<i>On a cold winter morning.</i>

232
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:42,005
<i>Feel the sound of the boiler
that has been running all night.</i>

233
00:19:43,582 --> 00:19:49,398
<i>They move us to tears because
they have a purpose of existence.</i>

234
00:19:50,878 --> 00:19:57,469
<i>Think of the lighthouse's holy
and beautiful heart of love.</i>

235
00:19:59,391 --> 00:20:01,944
<i>To be continued.</i>

236
00:20:07,454 --> 00:20:13,467
If only I had just one
purpose of existence, too.

237
00:20:22,046 --> 00:20:25,941
Il-soon, please, your mask!

238
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:32,532
Will the pretty Gop-dahn
please explain?

239
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:36,183
Our hospital has stabilizing rooms...

240
00:20:36,894 --> 00:20:41,651
for those who cause discomfort
to others or create safety issues.

241
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:45,019
And when it is deemed
a necessary treatment...

242
00:20:45,342 --> 00:20:48,659
- With the patient's consent.
- What consent?

243
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:50,489
You told me to stay in
the stabilizing

244
00:20:50,623 --> 00:20:52,990
room until I gave my consent!

245
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:55,285
I told you before that if you hit
others for no reason like that...

246
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:59,034
You have to go in the stabilizing room.

247
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:01,719
But Il-soon is a thief!

248
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:07,548
A detestable and shameless psycho,
anti-social and schizophrenic!

249
00:21:07,678 --> 00:21:09,566
Isn't that an attack
on his character?

250
00:21:09,694 --> 00:21:12,149
It's not an attack!
It's defense!

251
00:21:12,286 --> 00:21:14,556
He stole something
very important to me!

252
00:21:14,686 --> 00:21:21,178
Alright, what did Il-soon steal
from you, Dae-pyong?

253
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:24,060
They all point to me
if anything goes missing.

254
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:30,387
For the past 3 days, I can't
even receive a simple serve.

255
00:21:30,526 --> 00:21:35,163
While Park Il-soon won 5 games
just yesterday!

256
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:41,491
With the unique service technique
that I developed 12 years ago!

257
00:21:44,127 --> 00:21:47,443
There's no point not stealing.
They all think I did it anyway.

258
00:21:47,582 --> 00:21:49,469
Come on, that's not true.

259
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:54,747
...12 years ago!

260
00:21:59,102 --> 00:22:03,772
I see, you lost your ping-pong game.

261
00:22:04,574 --> 00:22:06,167
It was about a month ago.

262
00:22:06,686 --> 00:22:11,901
I suddenly lost my appetite
and couldn't eat.

263
00:22:13,183 --> 00:22:15,354
Think of what it did to my skin!

264
00:22:15,966 --> 00:22:20,723
Il-soon came and ate all my food.

265
00:22:20,863 --> 00:22:23,132
He's the one who stole the elastic
band around my waist

266
00:22:23,262 --> 00:22:24,189
for a whole week.

267
00:22:24,318 --> 00:22:25,911
The elastic band
for your pajamas?

268
00:22:26,046 --> 00:22:30,040
No, this skin colored elastic band
I was born with around my waist!

269
00:22:30,174 --> 00:22:31,483
Look at this.
It's all stretched out!

270
00:22:31,614 --> 00:22:34,070
Does he mean he was born
wearing pajamas?

271
00:22:35,166 --> 00:22:40,283
Then is Il-soon the one who stole
my memory, too?

272
00:22:40,415 --> 00:22:42,203
You bastard!

273
00:22:43,678 --> 00:22:45,467
You thief!

274
00:22:47,518 --> 00:22:49,885
- Give me back my ping-pong!
- You stretched my band!

275
00:22:50,015 --> 00:22:52,567
Mr. Pajamas, please!

276
00:23:00,286 --> 00:23:05,720
I told you your mother
didn't leave because of you.

277
00:23:13,118 --> 00:23:15,190
Yeah, right!

278
00:23:16,094 --> 00:23:18,363
Then how come she never
called but once?

279
00:23:19,071 --> 00:23:20,664
To tell me not to forget to
brush my teeth before bed!

280
00:23:23,582 --> 00:23:25,469
Fine! I'll admit it!

281
00:23:26,462 --> 00:23:27,956
Last night, I stole Thursday.

282
00:23:29,246 --> 00:23:30,261
Whose Thursday?

283
00:23:37,886 --> 00:23:40,821
How can a person steal Thursday?

284
00:24:02,622 --> 00:24:05,175
Look, Thursday's panties are missing.

285
00:24:09,054 --> 00:24:11,225
Monday's are right here, where else?

286
00:24:12,318 --> 00:24:15,035
I had no idea.

287
00:24:15,646 --> 00:24:17,534
He's really good.

288
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:20,602
This is a fortuitous crossing of
paths, for sure.

289
00:24:21,982 --> 00:24:25,015
I must find out more about this thief.

290
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:30,867
I have this thing
I want someone

291
00:24:31,006 --> 00:24:34,618
to steal away from me.

292
00:24:37,822 --> 00:24:39,993
I don't know how I'll ever thank you.

293
00:24:49,214 --> 00:24:50,904
So sorry for being so slow!

294
00:25:08,702 --> 00:25:10,775
Hello, everyone!
How are you?

295
00:25:11,198 --> 00:25:13,270
- Have you had lunch?
- Sure.

296
00:25:14,942 --> 00:25:16,251
Yeah, I have.

297
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:20,533
Have you had lunch?

298
00:25:21,438 --> 00:25:22,747
Don't skip the meal.

299
00:25:52,222 --> 00:25:53,334
Psycho.

300
00:26:00,862 --> 00:26:02,650
I'm not a psy-cho.

301
00:26:04,702 --> 00:26:06,196
I'm a cy-borg.

302
00:26:09,694 --> 00:26:12,149
Ah, I let slip.

303
00:26:12,862 --> 00:26:14,837
I promised Mom I wouldn't.

304
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:31,419
Mom, I think I'm a cyborg.

305
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:41,401
What's that?

306
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:46,584
I think it's kind of like a robot?

307
00:26:52,766 --> 00:26:55,668
Have you missed a period?
Because you're a cybor?

308
00:26:57,245 --> 00:27:00,661
Anything you want to eat?
Like radishes?

309
00:27:15,966 --> 00:27:19,381
Then it's okay.
Now go get some sleep.

310
00:27:21,245 --> 00:27:24,180
It's okay if you're a cybor.

311
00:27:25,374 --> 00:27:28,091
It won't interfere with
the way you live.

312
00:27:28,221 --> 00:27:30,109
Just don't let anybody know.

313
00:27:32,061 --> 00:27:37,212
Who would come to eat at a shop
where the daughter's a cybor?

314
00:27:37,726 --> 00:27:42,679
<i>Cyborg, are you thinking of
your Granny?</i>

315
00:27:43,486 --> 00:27:45,373
I certainly am.

316
00:27:46,461 --> 00:27:49,877
<i>You aren't feeling sad, are you?</i>

317
00:27:50,686 --> 00:27:54,101
No, why of course not!

318
00:27:54,814 --> 00:27:57,748
<i>She's wondering about you, too...</i>

319
00:27:58,078 --> 00:28:01,755
<i>and why you haven't killed
the white 'uns yet.</i>

320
00:28:01,886 --> 00:28:06,163
<i>She wonders why you don't bag
the white 'uns that dragged her away.</i>

321
00:28:06,302 --> 00:28:09,149
<i>And bring her the dentures.</i>

322
00:28:09,853 --> 00:28:11,064
But I...

323
00:28:13,597 --> 00:28:15,386
I don't have enough power.

324
00:28:16,958 --> 00:28:22,970
This charging method seems to
have its limitations.

325
00:28:23,486 --> 00:28:26,334
<i>I hope it's not
because of sympathy.</i>

326
00:28:26,462 --> 00:28:31,099
<i>You know that sympathy is
the worst of the 7 Deadly Sins.</i>

327
00:28:32,382 --> 00:28:33,593
No, really...

328
00:28:35,646 --> 00:28:37,620
It's not because of sympathy.

329
00:28:38,909 --> 00:28:42,422
<i>For your reference,
the other 6 are as follows.</i>

330
00:28:42,942 --> 00:28:44,731
<i>Being sad.</i>

331
00:28:47,645 --> 00:28:48,954
<i>Restlessness.</i>

332
00:28:53,502 --> 00:28:54,615
<i>Hesitating about anything.</i>

333
00:28:57,342 --> 00:28:59,317
<i>Useless daydreaming.</i>

334
00:29:01,662 --> 00:29:02,938
<i>Feeling guilty.</i>

335
00:29:06,814 --> 00:29:08,504
<i>Thankfulness.</i>

336
00:29:09,118 --> 00:29:12,435
<i>The above was in
the order of evilness.</i>

337
00:29:14,974 --> 00:29:16,087
Yes.

338
00:29:17,086 --> 00:29:22,137
<i>Useless daydreaming about whether
the white 'uns have grannies, too...</i>

339
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:29,144
<i>Sympathy for their grannies
if the white 'uns died...</i>

340
00:29:30,045 --> 00:29:34,388
<i>and hesitating about killing them.
You must forego these sins.</i>

341
00:29:46,526 --> 00:29:48,598
Floriculture Therapy

342
00:29:48,926 --> 00:29:50,235
Take your ping-pong back.

343
00:29:50,846 --> 00:29:54,075
It makes my butt itchy
every time I play.

344
00:29:57,373 --> 00:29:58,780
The right cheek.

345
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:01,081
Transfer!

346
00:30:27,293 --> 00:30:33,491
- Go Dae-pyong!
- Go, doc!

347
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:38,547
He is very polite.

348
00:30:38,974 --> 00:30:41,527
He's so humble he can't
even walk forwards.

349
00:30:42,814 --> 00:30:44,407
Court etiquette, he says.

350
00:30:50,685 --> 00:30:53,533
He thinks it's his fault
when anything goes wrong.

351
00:30:55,774 --> 00:30:57,181
Are you there?

352
00:30:58,365 --> 00:31:00,154
- Hello?
- What is it?!

353
00:31:00,285 --> 00:31:04,180
Just wondering if it was
my fault you lost?

354
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:10,046
He happened to drive past
the scene of an accident...

355
00:31:10,141 --> 00:31:12,313
and he was convinced
it was his fault.

356
00:31:15,614 --> 00:31:18,363
He followed the victims around
apologizing.

357
00:31:18,494 --> 00:31:20,381
When they couldn't stand it
any longer...

358
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:22,200
They reported him and
he was brought to this hospital.

359
00:31:23,773 --> 00:31:25,180
I said no!

360
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:28,157
It wasn't your fault, Duk-chun.

361
00:31:28,285 --> 00:31:32,758
It's my ping-pong!
It's too itchy to play!

362
00:31:35,774 --> 00:31:38,229
Duk-chun is an expert at saying
redundant things.

363
00:31:39,133 --> 00:31:44,054
Isn't ping-pong about
giving and receiving?

364
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:48,281
I don't think so!

365
00:31:48,414 --> 00:31:53,083
Must one always receive
after giving?

366
00:31:53,982 --> 00:31:58,838
Can't there be ping-pong
where we only give?

367
00:32:06,173 --> 00:32:09,686
So it was my fault.

368
00:32:17,566 --> 00:32:22,519
A cat is, above all,
a furry animal.

369
00:32:26,398 --> 00:32:30,969
Actually, my wife is furry, too.

370
00:32:35,325 --> 00:32:39,319
Isn't it obvious I'd become impotent

371
00:32:39,454 --> 00:32:41,341
with a furry wife?

372
00:32:42,045 --> 00:32:45,079
I'll hear from the judiciary soon.

373
00:32:45,214 --> 00:32:47,353
I filed a suit against her.

374
00:32:48,157 --> 00:32:52,435
She hid that she's a furry monster
when we got married.

375
00:32:53,534 --> 00:32:59,349
Making a police officer impotent is
an obstruction of his duties.

376
00:33:07,357 --> 00:33:09,626
Alright, transfer!

377
00:33:19,614 --> 00:33:20,726
Hello, there!

378
00:33:22,302 --> 00:33:24,669
How are you all doing?

379
00:33:25,757 --> 00:33:27,252
Have you had lunch?

380
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:28,502
Hello!

381
00:33:28,637 --> 00:33:30,710
How are you? Hello!

382
00:33:30,845 --> 00:33:31,772
Have you had lunch?

383
00:33:32,765 --> 00:33:33,878
Oh my god.

384
00:33:34,589 --> 00:33:35,317
I'm so sorry.

385
00:33:35,357 --> 00:33:37,245
Are you okay?

386
00:33:37,373 --> 00:33:38,682
I'm so sorry.

387
00:33:38,814 --> 00:33:40,788
- How can I tell you how sorry I am?
- I'm so tired!

388
00:33:40,926 --> 00:33:43,195
I'm sorry I made you tired.

389
00:33:43,325 --> 00:33:46,075
Why do I always tire people out
like this? I'm sorry.

390
00:33:46,973 --> 00:33:50,748
I had a dream...

391
00:33:52,029 --> 00:33:57,463
To make amends to everyone
I've ever troubled.

392
00:34:00,669 --> 00:34:06,004
People should make amends
whenever they've caused trouble.

393
00:34:09,598 --> 00:34:10,907
But now...

394
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:13,881
I've had all my politeness stolen.

395
00:34:15,165 --> 00:34:18,580
Now how am I supposed to apologize?

396
00:34:18,813 --> 00:34:22,872
Do you remember
where you lost it?

397
00:34:23,005 --> 00:34:26,715
You people don't know what
it's like to have troubled others!

398
00:34:26,845 --> 00:34:28,438
You bitch!

399
00:34:43,742 --> 00:34:45,432
Please steal it.

400
00:34:46,718 --> 00:34:48,408
My sympathy.

401
00:34:50,173 --> 00:34:51,482
Like Thursday.

402
00:34:51,613 --> 00:34:53,020
Sympathy?

403
00:34:53,821 --> 00:34:54,901
What's that?

404
00:34:55,518 --> 00:34:58,933
The feeling that stops me
from killing those I should.

405
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:03,254
I keep thinking...

406
00:35:04,062 --> 00:35:05,949
What if I killed the white 'uns...

407
00:35:06,845 --> 00:35:11,701
and they have grannies, too?
The poor grannies...

408
00:35:14,141 --> 00:35:15,254
Look, miss.

409
00:35:15,678 --> 00:35:17,750
When you speak to a person,

410
00:35:17,885 --> 00:35:20,155
you have to speak so that
the person can understand.

411
00:35:21,821 --> 00:35:23,610
Well, sympathy is...

412
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:29,910
My mom, aunt and uncle
shouldn't have acted that way!

413
00:35:30,334 --> 00:35:32,406
How could they have
so little sympathy?

414
00:35:33,501 --> 00:35:35,574
No one's a mouse because
they want to be a mouse.

415
00:35:35,709 --> 00:35:37,203
Don't even talk about moms!

416
00:35:38,685 --> 00:35:39,798
I'm sorry.

417
00:35:42,237 --> 00:35:46,613
And if you keep asking me
to steal something...

418
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:49,400
That's not stealing. It's just
taking what you're giving.

419
00:35:50,494 --> 00:35:51,988
Then what should I do?

420
00:35:52,125 --> 00:35:54,296
Well, when I...

421
00:35:56,541 --> 00:36:00,022
When I set out to steal
something from someone...

422
00:36:00,157 --> 00:36:03,004
I have to watch that person
stealthily for a few days.

423
00:36:03,709 --> 00:36:05,116
Can you do that?

424
00:36:05,821 --> 00:36:07,414
No problem.

425
00:36:07,549 --> 00:36:11,827
I have to watch them stealthily
and find something I want to steal

426
00:36:12,637 --> 00:36:16,630
Then I get the stealthy
desire to steal.

427
00:36:18,493 --> 00:36:19,987
Are you really up to this?

428
00:36:21,181 --> 00:36:22,391
You can trust me.

429
00:36:22,909 --> 00:36:25,178
Once I have the stealthy
desire to steal...

430
00:36:25,693 --> 00:36:28,149
It can only be completed if I steal
without the person's consent.

431
00:36:28,286 --> 00:36:30,042
They have to hate
my stealing from them.

432
00:36:30,173 --> 00:36:31,962
Can you do that for me?

433
00:36:33,438 --> 00:36:36,951
Promise to hate it.
I beg of you to do it.

434
00:36:38,621 --> 00:36:41,655
Since I walk backwards
she can't follow me...

435
00:36:41,789 --> 00:36:43,960
So she spends her time
talking to machines

436
00:36:44,094 --> 00:36:45,206
with those dentures in.

437
00:36:46,589 --> 00:36:49,044
She holds her hand out to doctors
and nurses to shake hands...

438
00:36:49,662 --> 00:36:53,459
and she wants to very much
but then suddenly pulls away.

439
00:36:59,358 --> 00:37:01,779
She loathes it so much
her hands tremble.

440
00:37:03,261 --> 00:37:05,716
Why does she hold out her hand if
she dislikes shaking hands so much?

441
00:37:08,158 --> 00:37:10,329
She hasn't done much,
why is she so exhausted?

442
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:23,096
Because she doesn't eat, no wonder.

443
00:38:03,709 --> 00:38:04,822
Coffee.

444
00:38:10,205 --> 00:38:11,317
Black.

445
00:38:17,789 --> 00:38:21,302
Are you over your flickering now?

446
00:38:36,318 --> 00:38:39,798
Lights, vending machine,
public phone, hiccup clock!

447
00:38:39,933 --> 00:38:42,868
Have you seen my granny's dentures?

448
00:38:43,005 --> 00:38:47,282
You can't understand me
without the dentures, can you?

449
00:38:55,101 --> 00:38:57,654
Where are those dentures?

450
00:38:57,789 --> 00:39:01,106
Young-goon doesn't eat her food.

451
00:39:03,645 --> 00:39:06,101
Gop-dahn eats it.

452
00:39:06,238 --> 00:39:09,271
Young-goon doesn't eat her food.
P.S. Gop-dahn eats it.

453
00:39:14,557 --> 00:39:18,267
For today's gathering,
we're talking about

454
00:39:18,397 --> 00:39:20,088
our most painful partings.

455
00:39:20,221 --> 00:39:23,637
How about you Duk-chun?

456
00:39:23,965 --> 00:39:24,893
Ready...

457
00:39:25,021 --> 00:39:28,153
My most painful parting was?

458
00:39:28,285 --> 00:39:29,300
My most painful parting was?

459
00:39:29,437 --> 00:39:33,234
My most painful parting was?

460
00:39:33,373 --> 00:39:34,485
Mother...

461
00:39:36,829 --> 00:39:37,942
fucker!

462
00:39:46,877 --> 00:39:48,284
How about me, doctor?

463
00:39:48,605 --> 00:39:50,580
Sure! Ready?

464
00:39:50,717 --> 00:39:54,132
My most painful parting was?

465
00:39:57,149 --> 00:39:59,516
When I was 15 and my mom left home...

466
00:40:04,061 --> 00:40:06,516
She took the entire family set
of electrical toothbrushes...

467
00:40:07,325 --> 00:40:08,819
and left for good.

468
00:40:09,629 --> 00:40:12,663
After that, I became a thief.

469
00:40:36,957 --> 00:40:38,550
You damned thief!

470
00:40:54,205 --> 00:40:55,896
Take your politeness back, mister.

471
00:40:56,509 --> 00:41:00,404
Your walking backwards and
saying redundant things, all of it.

472
00:41:01,405 --> 00:41:05,202
But why? I don't want to.

473
00:41:05,821 --> 00:41:08,374
People can't follow me from behind!

474
00:41:09,181 --> 00:41:11,155
Here. Transfer!

475
00:41:28,829 --> 00:41:31,578
<i>This news just in.</i>

476
00:41:35,933 --> 00:41:40,505
<i>She was moved to a nearby hospital
but never woke from her coma.</i>

477
00:41:48,317 --> 00:41:50,838
Granny is... critical?

478
00:41:54,141 --> 00:41:56,694
In critical condition...

479
00:41:57,405 --> 00:41:58,420
The white 'uns...

480
00:41:59,421 --> 00:42:01,876
Granny... earring...

481
00:42:05,757 --> 00:42:08,605
Oh... eating... radish...

482
00:42:09,885 --> 00:42:10,900
They don't like it.

483
00:42:11,901 --> 00:42:13,014
So...

484
00:42:13,821 --> 00:42:17,137
They won't let me give
her the dentures.

485
00:42:19,389 --> 00:42:22,389
My Granny... Ioves...

486
00:42:23,197 --> 00:42:24,790
radish... so much...

487
00:42:25,597 --> 00:42:28,347
I must... kill them... all.

488
00:42:30,589 --> 00:42:31,701
Confounded bastards...

489
00:42:37,597 --> 00:42:38,709
Please...

490
00:42:39,037 --> 00:42:40,247
Steal...

491
00:42:42,013 --> 00:42:43,125
My sympathy!

492
00:42:50,941 --> 00:42:52,348
Stop crying!

493
00:42:55,037 --> 00:42:56,149
Do you hate it?

494
00:42:58,013 --> 00:42:59,125
No?

495
00:43:02,525 --> 00:43:05,656
I told you that you must hate it!

496
00:43:13,085 --> 00:43:14,972
I hate it! I hate it! I hate it!

497
00:43:15,101 --> 00:43:16,792
I truly hate it!

498
00:43:22,877 --> 00:43:25,146
I'm taking away your sympathy.

499
00:43:26,397 --> 00:43:27,990
Alright, transfer!

500
00:43:35,805 --> 00:43:39,798
When I count to five and
snap my fingers, open your eyes.

501
00:43:41,181 --> 00:43:46,232
One, two, three, four.

502
00:43:46,365 --> 00:43:47,477
Five.

503
00:43:50,109 --> 00:43:51,996
No sympathy.

504
00:43:53,661 --> 00:43:54,588
Young-goon!

505
00:44:14,845 --> 00:44:15,958
Young-goon?

506
00:44:47,741 --> 00:44:48,854
My battery...

507
00:44:51,005 --> 00:44:52,598
Battery is...

508
00:44:54,364 --> 00:44:55,575
Empty.

509
00:44:55,709 --> 00:44:56,821
Young-goon!

510
00:45:01,725 --> 00:45:02,554
Young-goon?

511
00:45:03,741 --> 00:45:04,853
Young-goon?

512
00:45:20,157 --> 00:45:21,269
Wang Gop-dahn!

513
00:45:22,077 --> 00:45:23,189
Gop-dahn!

514
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:29,049
Tell me the truth.

515
00:45:31,293 --> 00:45:34,774
Did you really eat
Young-goon's food?

516
00:45:36,733 --> 00:45:40,049
<i>Beautiful Berne.</i>

517
00:45:40,285 --> 00:45:44,376
<i>Where the clear stream flows.</i>

518
00:45:47,485 --> 00:45:49,459
How much more will
I have to practice...

519
00:45:50,556 --> 00:45:54,069
to get into the Edelweiss
Boys' and Girls' Choir?

520
00:45:54,877 --> 00:45:57,910
In my case, I have an elastic band
around my waist

521
00:45:58,045 --> 00:46:00,598
I always feel reassured
even in strange places.

522
00:46:01,116 --> 00:46:04,248
Stop, or our eyes will meet
and it will be scandalous.

523
00:46:05,597 --> 00:46:13,050
<i>Red alpine roses.
Blooming in the dew.</i>

524
00:46:13,181 --> 00:46:15,734
When my life reaches its end.

525
00:46:15,868 --> 00:46:18,137
The elastic band will be
stretched to its limit

526
00:46:19,133 --> 00:46:23,028
I've already been practicing for
31 years since I failed the audition.

527
00:46:23,165 --> 00:46:24,953
Snap! And I'll just go back...

528
00:46:25,277 --> 00:46:28,026
To where I started off originally.

529
00:46:28,252 --> 00:46:32,246
<i>Das Obuh-lan-ya Obuh-lan.</i>

530
00:46:32,381 --> 00:46:35,796
<i>The beautiful mountains of Berne.</i>

531
00:46:35,932 --> 00:46:42,578
<i>Das Obuh-lan-ya Obuh-lan,
Oh, my love Berne...</i>

532
00:46:43,581 --> 00:46:46,232
Do you think humans can
go against gravity?

533
00:46:47,997 --> 00:46:49,012
Do you think...

534
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:51,031
humans can go...

535
00:46:51,933 --> 00:46:53,820
against gravity?

536
00:47:05,565 --> 00:47:07,353
I succeeded in my experiment!

537
00:47:15,996 --> 00:47:17,207
Sleep flying!

538
00:47:17,629 --> 00:47:21,720
Peppermint sherbet and
persimmon socks

539
00:47:22,333 --> 00:47:26,904
They create static electrical tension.

540
00:47:27,325 --> 00:47:30,456
And that makes the body float.

541
00:47:32,316 --> 00:47:34,204
Like superconducting
magnetically levitated trains.

542
00:47:34,332 --> 00:47:36,983
Watch. Here I go.

543
00:47:54,269 --> 00:47:58,546
Should avoid eating things like
chicken right before flying.

544
00:47:59,356 --> 00:48:03,350
Young-goon's always lying down
so I can't see her much these days

545
00:48:03,484 --> 00:48:06,419
Can you see me, Sul-mi?

546
00:48:07,613 --> 00:48:09,784
Partially, but...

547
00:48:12,317 --> 00:48:14,357
Why don't you take it off?

548
00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:24,729
What if I do and I'm invisible?

549
00:48:26,013 --> 00:48:28,085
My mom and dad used to act like
I wasn't there,

550
00:48:28,221 --> 00:48:29,814
even when I was.

551
00:48:29,949 --> 00:48:32,021
That's why I'm good at stealing.

552
00:48:32,157 --> 00:48:33,564
Because people can't see
me sometimes.

553
00:48:34,364 --> 00:48:36,153
From the time I was 20,
I learned electrical wiring.

554
00:48:36,284 --> 00:48:39,219
I made good money,
but I got caught stealing a motorcycle.

555
00:48:39,357 --> 00:48:43,929
When I was being tried, the judge
said something only I could hear.

556
00:48:44,060 --> 00:48:51,000
Defendant Park Il-soon
will eventually vanish into a dot.

557
00:48:52,669 --> 00:48:54,938
You shithead!

558
00:49:00,732 --> 00:49:01,942
Oh dear!

559
00:49:03,709 --> 00:49:06,262
I did all kinds of things in jail,

560
00:49:06,396 --> 00:49:08,185
because I felt like I was vanishing.

561
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:10,969
I stole other people's
clothes to wear

562
00:49:12,156 --> 00:49:13,847
and I brushed my teeth diligently.

563
00:49:17,885 --> 00:49:20,819
Once your teeth start to go,
there's no turning back.

564
00:49:20,956 --> 00:49:22,167
That's true.

565
00:49:23,836 --> 00:49:25,724
I had a psych evaluation and...

566
00:49:25,852 --> 00:49:28,307
They said I'm schizophrenic
and anti-social.

567
00:49:29,117 --> 00:49:30,611
Anti-social?

568
00:49:31,708 --> 00:49:34,163
Like stealing and fighting
for no reason.

569
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:37,530
And not having any sense of
guilt or sympathy.

570
00:49:38,236 --> 00:49:40,986
But I don't know why
they call me anti-social.

571
00:49:41,404 --> 00:49:45,201
I have my reasons for stealing.
I'm afraid I'll vanish.

572
00:49:45,916 --> 00:49:48,950
I'm anti-vanishing.

573
00:49:51,549 --> 00:49:53,818
They say there's no cure
for being anti-social.

574
00:49:53,948 --> 00:49:56,120
But the doctor says to have hope.

575
00:49:57,020 --> 00:49:59,955
Sometimes it goes away on its own
30 or 40 years later.

576
00:50:00,477 --> 00:50:03,127
Though usually that 30-40 years
are spent in prison...

577
00:50:03,452 --> 00:50:04,565
I see.

578
00:50:05,853 --> 00:50:08,308
I admit myself here because
I don't want to go to prison.

579
00:50:09,021 --> 00:50:09,563
Taxi!

580
00:50:09,597 --> 00:50:12,150
When I feel it coming on,
I head straight back here.

581
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:16,951
This is my fifth hospitalization
in four years.

582
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:22,002
With steady labor, I can manage
the hospital and medication costs.

583
00:50:24,252 --> 00:50:26,903
But do you think I can hold out
for 40 years like this?

584
00:50:27,804 --> 00:50:29,495
Without vanishing into a dot?

585
00:50:34,909 --> 00:50:36,502
What do you think?

586
00:50:44,412 --> 00:50:45,525
Just...

587
00:50:47,964 --> 00:50:49,273
Give up hope.

588
00:50:51,708 --> 00:50:52,821
And...

589
00:50:55,900 --> 00:50:57,013
Keep your strength up!

590
00:51:03,580 --> 00:51:04,693
Strength?

591
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:07,573
But Young-goon has no strength!

592
00:51:08,476 --> 00:51:11,324
I never thought you'd open up
about yourself like that.

593
00:51:12,029 --> 00:51:15,923
Well, you're getting
shock therapy today.

594
00:51:17,404 --> 00:51:18,516
Sul-mi?

595
00:51:19,709 --> 00:51:21,497
People tend to think

596
00:51:21,629 --> 00:51:24,760
that shock therapy is inhumane.

597
00:51:24,892 --> 00:51:26,648
But it isn't really, ma'am.

598
00:51:27,068 --> 00:51:30,385
It's a widely used treatment for
depression or catatonia.

599
00:51:30,525 --> 00:51:31,539
I see.

600
00:51:31,676 --> 00:51:33,946
There are patients who don't eat.

601
00:51:34,076 --> 00:51:36,051
Because of auditory hallucinations,
delusions, or emotional distress.

602
00:51:36,380 --> 00:51:38,354
They usually start eating again

603
00:51:38,491 --> 00:51:41,142
after 2-3 days
when medicated.

604
00:51:41,948 --> 00:51:45,842
But Young-goon has such
serious side effects to medication.

605
00:51:47,323 --> 00:51:51,120
Young-goon doesn't eat,
sleep, or move.

606
00:51:51,259 --> 00:51:54,292
She throws up her medication.

607
00:51:54,428 --> 00:51:56,402
She's completely catatonic.

608
00:51:56,540 --> 00:51:59,354
Are there side effects
to shock therapy?

609
00:51:59,484 --> 00:52:01,851
There can be some memory loss.

610
00:52:01,979 --> 00:52:07,129
That loss is okay,
but please just make her eat again.

611
00:52:51,705 --> 00:52:52,818
Ou get here?

612
00:52:55,354 --> 00:53:00,209
I should be getting merciless
as soon as possible...

613
00:53:02,906 --> 00:53:06,616
Since I'm the only one
you've got, Granny.

614
00:53:09,626 --> 00:53:11,317
Just wait.

615
00:53:12,313 --> 00:53:15,347
I'll get you your dentures

616
00:53:15,961 --> 00:53:17,456
and kill them all.

617
00:53:24,986 --> 00:53:25,815
What?

618
00:53:25,946 --> 00:53:28,401
The purpose of...

619
00:53:29,786 --> 00:53:30,996
What?

620
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:35,381
Of existence is...

621
00:53:42,138 --> 00:53:43,730
Slowly.

622
00:53:47,610 --> 00:53:49,017
Granny.

623
00:53:49,530 --> 00:53:50,642
What?

624
00:53:53,466 --> 00:53:54,873
50%

625
00:53:55,386 --> 00:53:56,695
60%

626
00:53:57,497 --> 00:53:58,904
70%

627
00:53:59,513 --> 00:54:00,920
80%

628
00:54:01,625 --> 00:54:03,119
90%

629
00:54:03,834 --> 00:54:05,492
Charging complete!

630
00:54:21,177 --> 00:54:22,290
Are you okay?

631
00:54:24,154 --> 00:54:25,364
Yes.

632
00:54:25,977 --> 00:54:27,286
Who am I?

633
00:54:28,761 --> 00:54:31,795
Dr. Choi Seul-ki

634
00:54:31,930 --> 00:54:33,523
Who's the president of Korea?

635
00:54:36,441 --> 00:54:38,962
It's okay. It'll come to you.

636
00:54:39,098 --> 00:54:42,327
That kind of memory skips back soon.

637
00:54:46,970 --> 00:54:49,042
I never knew in the first place.

638
00:54:53,881 --> 00:54:55,572
What do you remember?

639
00:54:55,993 --> 00:54:57,881
Everything.

640
00:54:58,970 --> 00:55:03,345
It was quiet and I was hooked up
with wires all over me.

641
00:55:03,481 --> 00:55:05,554
What else?

642
00:55:05,690 --> 00:55:07,763
In the incubator.

643
00:55:09,785 --> 00:55:11,858
My granny told me.

644
00:55:12,665 --> 00:55:15,415
She said I was weak from birth.

645
00:55:16,122 --> 00:55:21,838
They were afraid I'd die so
I was in an incubator for a while.

646
00:55:23,418 --> 00:55:27,695
Electrical wires came all around
and raised me.

647
00:55:28,506 --> 00:55:29,716
Young-goon.

648
00:55:29,849 --> 00:55:33,461
Can you tell me why you won't eat?

649
00:55:34,266 --> 00:55:37,582
Do you hear voices
telling you not to eat?

650
00:55:37,722 --> 00:55:39,697
Are you worried the food
is poisoned?

651
00:55:39,834 --> 00:55:41,689
Do you want to starve
yourself to death?

652
00:55:42,010 --> 00:55:43,603
It's okay.

653
00:55:43,737 --> 00:55:46,966
I sometimes
feel like dying, too.

654
00:55:50,457 --> 00:55:53,588
Why would a young lady
like you want to die?

655
00:55:54,394 --> 00:55:56,466
We must carry on living
through thick and thin.

656
00:56:00,921 --> 00:56:03,092
I can walk from here.

657
00:56:03,994 --> 00:56:05,783
I can feel my strength coming back.

658
00:56:08,986 --> 00:56:11,636
I feel like I've been born again.

659
00:56:42,842 --> 00:56:44,697
No hesitating about anything.

660
00:59:48,409 --> 00:59:50,297
No feeling guilty.

661
00:59:57,882 --> 01:00:02,355
"I feel so sorry for her
I could die."

662
01:00:05,754 --> 01:00:07,160
"Please take care...

663
01:00:07,865 --> 01:00:10,037
of Young-goon."

664
01:00:13,242 --> 01:00:15,795
"I think I'm feeling..."

665
01:00:19,098 --> 01:00:23,669
"Sym... Sympathy for Young-goon?"

666
01:00:28,377 --> 01:00:30,930
You're saying you feel sympathy?

667
01:00:33,657 --> 01:00:36,112
Please steal Gop-dahn's
sleep flying method.

668
01:00:38,265 --> 01:00:42,160
She has developed
a strange way of flying.

669
01:00:42,585 --> 01:00:45,138
And she flies to Kyu-suk
every night and troubles him.

670
01:00:48,441 --> 01:00:51,573
I'll give you my voice in exchange.

671
01:00:53,433 --> 01:00:56,183
You're listening to me now so you

672
01:00:56,313 --> 01:01:00,852
can tell how beautiful my voice is.

673
01:01:03,770 --> 01:01:05,460
You think your voice
will be enough?

674
01:01:07,610 --> 01:01:08,820
Go on a hunger strike.

675
01:01:11,450 --> 01:01:15,344
Join in the strike, Eun-young.

676
01:01:28,249 --> 01:01:29,842
Steal Eun-young's voice for me.

677
01:01:30,553 --> 01:01:33,553
My flying socks are the second
most important thing to me.

678
01:01:34,169 --> 01:01:35,762
Next to my SK-ll cosmetics.

679
01:01:36,377 --> 01:01:37,686
Kyu-suk is mine.

680
01:01:40,409 --> 01:01:44,882
Can you tell me why you are
on a hunger strike?

681
01:01:47,225 --> 01:01:48,719
I think it's my fault.

682
01:01:50,105 --> 01:01:51,796
Please release Young-goon.

683
01:01:53,753 --> 01:01:55,825
Please release her soon.

684
01:01:56,249 --> 01:01:57,558
And you two stay apart!

685
01:01:59,417 --> 01:02:00,529
Everyone.

686
01:02:00,953 --> 01:02:03,987
Do you know why Young-goon
is in the stabilizing room?

687
01:02:04,569 --> 01:02:06,740
She hasn't eaten for
a long time

688
01:02:06,874 --> 01:02:08,848
and is very weak.

689
01:02:09,465 --> 01:02:14,037
So she has to eat under the careful
supervision of the staff.

690
01:02:17,145 --> 01:02:22,774
If she continues to starve
for 3 more days, Young-goon will die.

691
01:02:25,017 --> 01:02:26,904
Do you understand?

692
01:03:05,113 --> 01:03:08,212
I told you taking food through
the nose tube would hurt.

693
01:03:08,922 --> 01:03:09,936
Let's.

694
01:03:13,913 --> 01:03:15,320
How delicious!

695
01:03:15,449 --> 01:03:18,678
Want to eat now without the tube?

696
01:03:41,913 --> 01:03:43,506
She says she doesn't want to eat!

697
01:03:44,985 --> 01:03:45,811
Let me go!

698
01:03:47,481 --> 01:03:49,074
She doesn't want to eat!

699
01:03:49,401 --> 01:03:50,513
Oh, my god! Ll-soon!

700
01:03:51,417 --> 01:03:53,010
Ll-soon, calm down.

701
01:03:53,817 --> 01:03:56,086
You can't force a patient
without their consent!

702
01:03:57,465 --> 01:04:00,313
She has the right not to eat!

703
01:04:08,409 --> 01:04:09,521
Young-goon!

704
01:04:11,001 --> 01:04:14,296
The vending machine says hi.

705
01:04:16,153 --> 01:04:24,271
Young-goon!

706
01:04:24,409 --> 01:04:25,719
Let her go!

707
01:04:27,961 --> 01:04:29,554
She doesn't want to eat.

708
01:04:32,281 --> 01:04:33,775
Let her go.

709
01:04:37,369 --> 01:04:39,158
She doesn't want to eat.

710
01:05:22,329 --> 01:05:23,441
Are you okay?

711
01:05:24,345 --> 01:05:25,654
I hope you didn't get hurt.

712
01:05:27,416 --> 01:05:30,646
Hold out your hand.

713
01:05:40,761 --> 01:05:42,167
Put them on

714
01:05:42,297 --> 01:05:45,712
Lie on your stomach with your
arms out and rub your feet hard.

715
01:05:47,097 --> 01:05:52,312
It makes static electrical tension
and makes your body float.

716
01:05:52,921 --> 01:05:54,230
You don't eat chicken, right?

717
01:05:54,937 --> 01:05:56,530
I'll start singing for you.

718
01:05:56,665 --> 01:05:59,513
When you start floating,
make yourself small.

719
01:06:00,025 --> 01:06:03,919
<i>I went across the Switzerland
where all the yodlers be.</i>

720
01:06:04,057 --> 01:06:07,570
<i>I tried to run the mountains and they...</i>

721
01:06:07,705 --> 01:06:11,120
<i>I climb up in the mountains
when a clear sunny day.</i>

722
01:06:11,257 --> 01:06:14,672
<i>I met a little Swiss girl
in a Swiss chalet.</i>

723
01:06:14,809 --> 01:06:21,934
<i>She taught me how to yodel.</i>

724
01:06:22,073 --> 01:06:28,565
<i>I will teach you how to yodel.</i>

725
01:06:43,673 --> 01:06:47,088
<i>I went across the Switzerland
where all the yodlers be.</i>

726
01:06:47,225 --> 01:06:50,738
<i>I tried to run the mountains and they...</i>

727
01:06:50,873 --> 01:06:54,256
<i>I climb up in the mountains
when a clear sunny day.</i>

728
01:06:54,393 --> 01:06:57,808
<i>I met a little Swiss girl
in a Swiss chalet.<i>

729
01:06:57,945 --> 01:07:05,201
<i>She taught me how to yodel.</i>

730
01:07:05,336 --> 01:07:12,309
<i>I will teach you how to yodel.</i>

731
01:07:34,777 --> 01:07:36,948
This is the problem!

732
01:07:37,465 --> 01:07:38,774
Look at this face.

733
01:07:42,841 --> 01:07:44,913
It's natural men wouldn't
leave her alone.

734
01:07:53,881 --> 01:07:55,670
You're a cyborg, so you can't eat?

735
01:07:58,744 --> 01:08:00,533
You're a cyborg,
so you don't need to eat?

736
01:08:03,257 --> 01:08:05,144
I'll break down if I eat.

737
01:08:06,521 --> 01:08:07,830
Let's go and eat!

738
01:08:09,304 --> 01:08:11,377
Please, Young-goon?

739
01:08:11,801 --> 01:08:14,070
Come on.

740
01:08:14,201 --> 01:08:15,608
Let's eat! Why not?

741
01:08:16,409 --> 01:08:19,158
You're a cyborg but you can
still eat and be OK.

742
01:08:30,393 --> 01:08:31,986
Granny!

743
01:08:32,121 --> 01:08:35,733
Young-goon! My child!

744
01:08:35,865 --> 01:08:39,280
Young-goon!

745
01:08:45,465 --> 01:08:49,458
I didn't use them. I just held
them up to see how they looked.

746
01:08:52,953 --> 01:08:54,644
Your teeth will fall out.

747
01:08:55,640 --> 01:08:59,797
Use them only
when you really miss me.

748
01:09:01,945 --> 01:09:07,575
Look? My teeth all fell out
because of those dentures.

749
01:09:09,145 --> 01:09:13,520
You're lying! You didn't have any
in the first place!

750
01:09:16,633 --> 01:09:20,527
This confounded elastic band!

751
01:09:20,665 --> 01:09:23,315
My back is killing me.

752
01:09:23,449 --> 01:09:28,304
Young-goon, you have to let me go.

753
01:09:28,440 --> 01:09:30,710
Young-goon, my dear!

754
01:09:37,432 --> 01:09:40,466
Granny! Granny!

755
01:09:42,521 --> 01:09:43,830
The purpose of...

756
01:09:43,961 --> 01:09:45,073
What?

757
01:09:46,361 --> 01:09:49,012
The purpose of existence is what?
Granny!

758
01:09:49,721 --> 01:09:52,176
Granny!

759
01:10:00,377 --> 01:10:02,351
She vanished into a dot.

760
01:10:04,856 --> 01:10:07,507
No being sad.

761
01:10:11,384 --> 01:10:15,956
She was cremated and
her ashes laid to rest.

762
01:10:18,296 --> 01:10:19,889
A week ago.

763
01:10:30,105 --> 01:10:34,960
I thought of you and
brought a spoonful.

764
01:10:41,017 --> 01:10:42,326
It's Granny.

765
01:10:57,049 --> 01:10:58,543
They got mixed up.

766
01:11:10,648 --> 01:11:11,761
Mom.

767
01:11:13,432 --> 01:11:15,123
It's Young-goon!

768
01:11:22,264 --> 01:11:26,355
You didn't tell the people here
you're a mouse, did you?

769
01:11:27,353 --> 01:11:31,630
I mean, a cybor, did you?

770
01:11:37,049 --> 01:11:40,344
You did... didn't you!

771
01:11:42,584 --> 01:11:45,901
How can you think only of yourself?

772
01:11:46,041 --> 01:11:51,191
A person can't just go around
saying everything they want to!

773
01:11:52,376 --> 01:11:53,489
Mom?

774
01:11:55,545 --> 01:11:56,657
Yes?

775
01:11:58,233 --> 01:12:00,502
There's something
I really want to say.

776
01:12:03,225 --> 01:12:04,337
What is it?

777
01:12:06,680 --> 01:12:08,469
Granny's dentures...

778
01:12:10,424 --> 01:12:12,464
You left them behind on purpose,
didn't you?

779
01:12:14,329 --> 01:12:16,695
So she couldn't eat radishes
at the sanitorium.

780
01:12:20,280 --> 01:12:28,399
Oh, woe, woe is me!

781
01:12:29,016 --> 01:12:35,311
Oh woe, woe is me!

782
01:12:53,753 --> 01:13:01,009
Oh woe, woe is me!

783
01:13:26,168 --> 01:13:29,485
Granny, I'm...

784
01:13:30,872 --> 01:13:37,550
I'm in a position where
being sad is forbidden...

785
01:16:02,392 --> 01:16:04,181
No restlessness.

786
01:16:07,288 --> 01:16:11,663
You have no energy because you let
Gop-dahn have all your food!

787
01:16:28,760 --> 01:16:30,353
White rice with...

788
01:16:31,929 --> 01:16:38,420
Plumes of steam coming up from it.

789
01:16:39,128 --> 01:16:41,681
<i>No useless daydreaming</i>
White winter rice...

790
01:16:41,816 --> 01:16:48,308
If a kebab comes along,
pull out the stick and eat it up.

791
01:16:52,376 --> 01:16:54,264
The persimmon spoke.

792
01:16:55,833 --> 01:16:57,905
I'm shy so...

793
01:16:58,232 --> 01:17:03,928
Please take me in one mouthful.

794
01:17:06,552 --> 01:17:12,564
Winter rice.
Granny's pickled radish.

795
01:17:14,521 --> 01:17:15,830
Spring rice.

796
01:17:16,920 --> 01:17:18,611
Summer rice.

797
01:17:20,089 --> 01:17:21,976
Fall rice.

798
01:17:39,641 --> 01:17:42,957
<i>Silent rice.</i>

799
01:17:43,672 --> 01:17:47,666
<i>Holy rice.</i>

800
01:17:48,472 --> 01:17:56,405
<i>All is calm. All is rice.</i>

801
01:17:57,112 --> 01:18:03,758
<i>Round yon virgin mother and child.</i>

802
01:18:04,856 --> 01:18:10,191
<i>Eating noodles, tender and mild.</i>

803
01:18:35,832 --> 01:18:37,425
Her looks are the problem.

804
01:18:38,328 --> 01:18:41,263
Oh, you heartbreaker!

805
01:18:54,265 --> 01:18:55,377
Young-goon?

806
01:18:55,608 --> 01:18:56,721
Young-goon!

807
01:18:59,640 --> 01:19:01,233
It's a rice-megatron.

808
01:19:02,424 --> 01:19:05,937
A device that converts food
calories into electrical energy.

809
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:10,899
So when you eat rice,

810
01:19:11,032 --> 01:19:14,545
it'll compress and explode it

811
01:19:14,681 --> 01:19:16,274
into energy.

812
01:19:18,136 --> 01:19:20,886
Charging takes a long time.

813
01:19:21,016 --> 01:19:22,609
Food is best when you're in a hurry.

814
01:19:22,744 --> 01:19:26,356
Rice is sufficient for regular
everyday electric energy.

815
01:19:27,064 --> 01:19:29,235
Isn't it incredible?

816
01:19:42,008 --> 01:19:43,023
Here's the door.

817
01:19:44,216 --> 01:19:45,907
They're usually in back.

818
01:19:46,616 --> 01:19:47,728
Really?

819
01:19:51,416 --> 01:19:52,528
Now...

820
01:19:55,832 --> 01:19:57,523
Please remove your top.

821
01:19:57,656 --> 01:19:58,583
What?

822
01:20:02,072 --> 01:20:05,684
Please remove your top.

823
01:21:03,160 --> 01:21:05,910
I'll have to cut the skin
to open the door.

824
01:21:35,192 --> 01:21:36,305
I'm opening it.

825
01:21:39,704 --> 01:21:41,297
No wonder why.

826
01:21:42,392 --> 01:21:43,985
I get itchy there.

827
01:21:45,560 --> 01:21:49,520
It was because the door was there!

828
01:21:49,656 --> 01:21:53,550
It's open, so I'm putting in
my hand and attaching the device.

829
01:21:54,072 --> 01:21:55,087
Okay.

830
01:21:56,184 --> 01:21:57,296
I'm going in.

831
01:21:58,680 --> 01:22:01,047
Look at all that dust!

832
01:22:18,840 --> 01:22:22,997
I wish I could thank you
for all you've done.

833
01:22:23,992 --> 01:22:27,505
For stealthily stealing
my sympathy before, too.

834
01:22:29,368 --> 01:22:31,539
I'd like to, but...

835
01:22:32,343 --> 01:22:35,573
<i>No thankfulness.</i>
I'm forbidden...

836
01:22:35,704 --> 01:22:38,454
by law to feel thankfulness.

837
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:52,727
What?

838
01:22:52,855 --> 01:22:54,830
Pickled radish!

839
01:23:19,160 --> 01:23:22,673
One, hold the spoon
with your right hand.

840
01:23:30,456 --> 01:23:35,889
Two, take some rice
and bring it to your mouth.

841
01:23:43,800 --> 01:23:48,371
Three, open your mouth
and put the spoon in.

842
01:24:12,376 --> 01:24:14,165
What if I eat,

843
01:24:14,967 --> 01:24:17,423
and the rice-megatron doesn't work?

844
01:24:20,152 --> 01:24:23,185
I'll fix it.
I'm a technician, remember?

845
01:24:24,567 --> 01:24:28,342
Maybe not now, but what if it
breaks down later?

846
01:24:29,048 --> 01:24:30,455
Or after that?

847
01:24:33,655 --> 01:24:35,543
Call me.
I make house calls for repairs.

848
01:24:36,535 --> 01:24:38,030
It's a warranty for life.

855
01:25:02,615 --> 01:25:06,412
Three, open your mouth
and put the spoon in.

856
01:25:30,168 --> 01:25:35,089
Four, close your mouth and
slowly pull the spoon out.

857
01:25:37,240 --> 01:25:38,352
Five.

858
01:25:39,160 --> 01:25:40,272
We're going to chew.

859
01:25:44,247 --> 01:25:47,379
Chew. Chew.

860
01:26:00,471 --> 01:26:01,584
Are you OK?

861
01:26:03,992 --> 01:26:06,643
Six, swallow.

862
01:26:14,648 --> 01:26:15,957
You can do it, Young-goon.

863
01:26:16,664 --> 01:26:22,098
When I count to five and snap,
you'll swallow.

864
01:26:23,095 --> 01:26:24,208
On five.

865
01:26:25,112 --> 01:26:26,421
Ready?

866
01:26:28,280 --> 01:26:29,392
One

867
01:26:32,216 --> 01:26:33,426
Two

868
01:26:35,639 --> 01:26:36,461
Three

869
01:28:39,096 --> 01:28:43,831
Granny liked listening to the radio.

870
01:28:45,208 --> 01:28:52,082
Me, too. I lose track of time
listening to the radio.

871
01:28:53,175 --> 01:28:59,373
But, she listened to
keep track of time.

872
01:29:01,624 --> 01:29:04,177
Because she was at home all day.

873
01:29:07,384 --> 01:29:12,435
We were listening to the 4:00 show
when mom came home.

874
01:29:13,816 --> 01:29:16,533
With my aunt and uncle.

875
01:29:22,327 --> 01:29:24,400
Young-goon, turn down the radio.

876
01:29:25,592 --> 01:29:26,901
What's that smell?

877
01:29:29,335 --> 01:29:31,506
For crying out loud!

878
01:29:33,656 --> 01:29:38,609
Eating radish all day,
of course it'd stink.

879
01:29:42,008 --> 01:29:44,561
I rest all day and come home to work

880
01:29:44,695 --> 01:29:46,102
with her here like this.

881
01:29:46,231 --> 01:29:49,614
I mean, work all day and
come home to rest.

882
01:29:49,751 --> 01:29:54,802
How could you bear living like this?

883
01:30:00,023 --> 01:30:02,871
Granny likes listening to the radio.

884
01:30:02,999 --> 01:30:04,788
She likes this one even more since...

885
01:30:04,919 --> 01:30:06,512
Her clever little Young-goon
made it for her.

886
01:30:06,647 --> 01:30:09,298
Mom, aunt, uncle! Shut up!

887
01:30:09,432 --> 01:30:11,025
We can't hear the radio.

888
01:30:12,216 --> 01:30:13,906
I said, turn down the radio!

889
01:30:14,040 --> 01:30:15,349
It's giving me a headache.

890
01:30:28,215 --> 01:30:31,532
Come on, the ambulance is waiting.

891
01:30:37,815 --> 01:30:40,466
We should have taken her to
the sanitarium way before!

892
01:30:51,895 --> 01:30:53,967
The purpose of existence is...

893
01:31:28,247 --> 01:31:29,458
Doctor?

894
01:31:30,840 --> 01:31:33,393
The secret of my existence.

895
01:31:35,640 --> 01:31:38,869
I have a secret
I'm not supposed to tell.

896
01:31:40,055 --> 01:31:42,030
Shall I tell you?

897
01:31:45,431 --> 01:31:49,904
The truth is, I'm...

898
01:32:08,632 --> 01:32:09,744
Young-goon.

899
01:32:11,895 --> 01:32:13,008
That tickles.

900
01:32:23,800 --> 01:32:26,069
So you're a cyborg, Young-goon!

901
01:32:29,335 --> 01:32:31,124
It must have been hard for you.

902
01:32:34,519 --> 01:32:37,934
It's okay, now I know.

903
01:32:38,839 --> 01:32:41,971
After knowing, trusting
is the more important thing.

904
01:32:42,584 --> 01:32:43,794
You trust me, right?

905
01:32:46,519 --> 01:32:50,797
But you know what's most important
after knowing and trusting?

906
01:32:52,855 --> 01:32:56,171
Eating. Eating food.

907
01:33:20,855 --> 01:33:21,967
Be?

908
01:33:22,968 --> 01:33:24,080
Me?

909
01:33:24,695 --> 01:33:25,807
Be?

910
01:33:26,711 --> 01:33:27,823
Nee?

911
01:33:28,631 --> 01:33:29,743
Nee!

912
01:33:29,975 --> 01:33:31,055
Knee.

913
01:33:33,591 --> 01:33:34,704
Next one.

914
01:33:39,831 --> 01:33:40,374
Da?

915
01:33:40,407 --> 01:33:41,519
A?

916
01:33:44,343 --> 01:33:46,514
Yo, Ra, A?

917
01:33:49,815 --> 01:33:50,742
A?

918
01:33:52,311 --> 01:33:53,326
Da?

919
01:33:54,519 --> 01:33:56,308
- Da?
- Da!

920
01:34:01,720 --> 01:34:06,259
You're a nuke bomb your purpose
zov existence zis...

921
01:34:06,968 --> 01:34:10,677
World zend.

922
01:34:10,808 --> 01:34:12,880
Knee da billion bolts.

923
01:34:16,951 --> 01:34:17,966
You're a nuke bomb.

924
01:34:18,103 --> 01:34:19,696
A nuke bomb?

925
01:34:20,312 --> 01:34:22,286
Purpose of existence zis...

926
01:34:24,919 --> 01:34:26,129
Zis...

927
01:34:29,527 --> 01:34:32,374
Purpose of existence is.

928
01:34:33,752 --> 01:34:37,330
World zend.

929
01:34:38,904 --> 01:34:43,857
Need a billion volts.

930
01:34:43,991 --> 01:34:47,886
Billion volts?
Need a billion volts. Nuke bomb.

931
01:34:52,248 --> 01:34:53,655
What's a zend?

932
01:34:57,335 --> 01:34:59,310
Who's Zend?

933
01:35:02,519 --> 01:35:03,631
Shut up!

934
01:35:38,647 --> 01:35:40,240
Perfect weather, isn't it?

935
01:35:45,079 --> 01:35:47,632
You shouldn't throw trash away
just anywhere.

936
01:35:56,023 --> 01:35:57,233
Why not?

937
01:35:59,959 --> 01:36:01,846
It'll all be over once I blow up.

938
01:36:03,127 --> 01:36:03,855
You're a nuke bomb. Your purpose of
existence is the world's end.

939
01:36:03,895 --> 01:36:04,623
Need a billion volts.

940
01:36:04,663 --> 01:36:07,314
Why would a young lady
like you blow up?

941
01:36:08,119 --> 01:36:09,712
We must carry on living
through thick and thin.

942
01:36:19,799 --> 01:36:22,255
Come on, hurry up!

943
01:36:34,199 --> 01:36:37,614
Think there's really a billion volts
in one bolt of lightening?

944
01:36:46,647 --> 01:36:52,462
<i>Round yon virgin.</i>

945
01:36:52,599 --> 01:36:55,731
<i>Eating noodles.</i>

946
01:36:56,631 --> 01:36:57,646
It's cold.

947
01:37:02,583 --> 01:37:03,793
The persimmon.

948
01:37:09,303 --> 01:37:10,994
The rice.

949
01:37:13,815 --> 01:37:16,052
Have you seen the cork for this?

950
01:37:16,279 --> 01:37:18,734
The person who throws away paper

951
01:37:18,871 --> 01:37:20,366
and gum any place probably lost it.

952
01:37:20,503 --> 01:37:21,997
What's he talking about?

953
01:37:24,151 --> 01:37:28,144
The precious wine got rain in it!

954
01:37:41,527 --> 01:37:42,737
What a waste!

955
01:37:53,399 --> 01:37:55,090
What if it doesn't hit me?

956
01:37:55,703 --> 01:37:56,816
Huh?

957
01:37:58,487 --> 01:38:02,863
Just, give up hope and...

958
01:38:14,135 --> 01:38:15,150
Let's keep our strength up!

959
01:38:26,775 --> 01:38:28,084
What do we do now?

960
01:38:30,519 --> 01:38:32,494
Let's just take off
our wet socks anyway.

961
01:39:21,463 --> 01:39:23,699
But they're not the only things wet.

962
01:39:42,167 --> 01:39:43,662
More than our socks are wet.

963
