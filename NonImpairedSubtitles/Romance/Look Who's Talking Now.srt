00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,235
Don't get out of this bathtub! Julie!

2
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:35,668
Julie!

3
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,832
Julie Christina Ubriacco!

4
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,676
You're dripping suds
all over the place.

5
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,434
Come here. Where are you?

6
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:48,678
I don't want to brush my teeth.
I brushed them Saturday.

7
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,434
You'll have plants
growing out of your mouth.

8
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,438
Honey?

9
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,636
Are you all right?

10
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,831
This is why we don't run around
all wet.

11
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,557
I don't want to go to bed.

12
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:24,429
- You got to go to bed.
- I went to bed last night.

13
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,069
How many times a week
do I have to go to bed?

14
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:31,438
Once upon a time, there was a princess
and she moved to Queens. The end.

15
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,232
That's not a story.

16
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:36,233
It is tonight. Good night.

17
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,034
- Change partners.
- Do-si-do.

18
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,878
Daddy, tell me a story.

19
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,031
Two nuns walk into a bar...

20
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,356
- James!
- What?

21
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,749
Oh, man.

22
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,833
- Night-light!
- Night-light!

23
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,436
Damn! Honey...

24
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,838
...did you leave that truck there?

25
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,833
- Mikey did it.
- Good night, Julie.

26
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,158
Mom, want to play teacups?

27
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,834
No, I don't want to play teacups.
Good night.

28
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,035
Good night.

29
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,231
Do I want to play teacups?

30
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,878
Man, am I exhausted!

31
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,032
I know. I feel like I can't move.

32
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,634
Every night we go through
the same thing.

33
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,755
What?

34
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,638
What is that look?

35
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,239
Are you kidding?

36
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,429
Honey, no.
They're not even asleep yet.

37
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,232
- They will be.
- No, they won't.

38
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,233
They're probably outside the door,
playing teacups.

39
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,237
Wait. No. Honey...

40
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,271
...they're probably right outside.

41
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,351
Lock the door.

42
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,238
Oh, Mollie.

43
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,033
Oh, James.

44
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,232
- Oh, Princess.
- Oh, Trooper.

45
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,639
It was a lovely evening.

46
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:57,236
Was? I take you to the best
dumpster in town...

47
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,789
...and all I get is a lick
on the cheek?

48
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,353
I'm not that kind of spaniel.

49
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,114
Come on. You're the cutest thing
on four legs.

50
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,476
I think you're wonderful, but...

51
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,836
...I can't.

52
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,359
Wait! Princess.

53
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,553
I didn't want to tell you...

54
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,236
...but I'm going to the vet tomorrow.
I may not make it.

55
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,436
Oh, Trooper.

56
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,709
Really?

57
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,035
Bingo.

58
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,477
Yes! I am the king!

59
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,948
The king of the kennel!

60
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,633
Losers! Losers!

61
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,635
Who cares?
She was a dog anyway.

62
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,558
There's another one! Go for it!

63
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,472
Don't tell the guys.

64
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,438
Oh, boy! Oh, boy! Oh, boy!

65
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,428
And another one!

66
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,432
They're all over!

67
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,198
Come to papa!

68
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,034
What will the girls
at the hydrant say?

69
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,918
Ma, check it out.

70
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,232
I got these things on my face to open.
I can see!

71
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,873
I can see...

72
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,429
...wrinkly butts!

73
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,353
They're not mine.
They're your brothers and sisters.

74
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,240
Good. That makes me the cute one.

75
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,952
So how did this happen?

76
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,679
How did this happen?

77
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:46,469
Look, here come the three kings.
It must be a miracle.

78
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,270
- Who were they?
- They're my masters.

79
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,313
They're hideous.

80
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,030
They're just big dogs who walk funny.
You take care of them.

81
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,356
I don't want any stupid masters.

82
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,158
Someday you will.

83
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,437
I'll never get my figure back.
It's Cycle Four for me.

84
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,433
What are you colouring?

85
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,112
Christmas list.

86
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,432
Christmas list in September?
What is that?

87
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,075
A dog? We've been through this.

88
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,470
But, Mom, we need a dog.

89
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:30,236
Because, those guys who come to sell
stuff, he could chew their legs off.

90
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,913
That would be nice, but...

91
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,435
And you could save money.
He could babysit.

92
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,236
You know dogs can't babysit.

93
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,874
Dogs are smart.
We could teach him stuff.

94
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,634
Yes, we could.
Like, how to pick up your room.

95
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,279
- Cool.
- Cool.

96
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,476
I'll tell you what I will do.

97
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,871
I promise you
that we will buy you a dog.

98
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,872
And I know you'll treat it well.

99
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:55,715
But we live in this teeny apartment,
and it wouldn't be fair to a dog.

100
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,678
What if Santa thinks it is?

101
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,713
Let's talk after school.

102
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,473
You always say that.

103
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,278
You always bug me.

104
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,635
Bug, bug, bug.

105
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,558
Go bug your teacher.

106
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,994
Julie!

107
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,956
Snap out of it, honey.
Arert you bored with that tape yet?

108
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,634
- It's good.
- It's good? With a pass to Julie...

109
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,839
...up she goes.
She scores a hundred million points.

110
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,830
Most girls are obsessed with ponies,
not sweaty men making jump shots.

111
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,951
Should we be worried? Mike?

112
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,636
It's the Suns. If it were
the Mavericks, I'd be worried.

113
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,359
Let me look at you.

114
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,034
- I don't know about the tie.
- What?

115
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,429
Silly.

116
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,234
You haven't seen the whole effect.
Look at this.

117
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,233
It does this.

118
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,637
Are you going to wear that
on a job interview?

119
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,711
- It's a joke.
- I know it's a joke.

120
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,598
- No, you didn't.
- Yes, I did.

121
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,831
This is the tie I'm going to wear.

122
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,114
That is a joke.

123
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,033
What?

124
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:10,229
They'll know my wife put me in
this suit. It's the colour of poo.

125
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,431
Daddy said, "poo."

126
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,631
Mike, what do you think of this suit?

127
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,752
- You look like my principal.
- Even he thinks it's stupid.

128
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,638
He isn't offering a dental plan.

129
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,035
This isn't me. I want to be myself.

130
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,595
You won't get this job
if you're yourself.

131
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,830
I didn't mean it to sound that way.

132
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,550
A CEO of a corporation is looking
for a certain demeanor...

133
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,954
...in a corporate pilot.

134
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,668
Don't tell them you still drive a cab.

135
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,957
Let me drive. Sit in back
and act like you don't know me.

136
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,839
- And don't tell long stories.
- I won't talk.

137
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,270
- You can talk, but, James...
- What?

138
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,238
- Don't tell jokes.
- I'm funny.

139
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:52,228
- You are funny, in sort of a...
- Corny.

140
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,909
Corny kind of funny.

141
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,633
Bash Brothers!

142
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,439
Look out for that pud...

143
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,239
Sorry about the suit.

144
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,677
My son kind of splattered me
this morning.

145
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,832
We were doing this kind of
"Bash Brothers" thing...

146
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,878
It's not spit-up or anything.
It's just...

147
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,633
...mud.

148
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:19,949
Frankly, Mr. Ubriacco, your résumé
is not very extensive.

149
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,679
I know that.

150
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:25,037
Yet people who have flown with you
insist that I meet you.

151
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,628
Really?

152
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,319
I'd be interested to know why.

153
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,595
May I?

154
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,159
Mr. Martin.
I know why he recommended me.

155
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,672
We're on this flight,
and they're having a party...

156
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:45,514
...and singing that English song:

157
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,236
You know, you're English.
I get on the microphone and say:

158
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,634
You had to be there.

159
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,839
God, I hope he doesn't blow it.

160
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,235
When he gets nervous, he gets honest.

161
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:05,079
And that is a major
business liability.

162
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:08,039
- I think he'll be okay.
- I think he's freezing up.

163
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,199
I've been married to him long enough.
I have ESP. He's freezing up.

164
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,949
And he said, "That thing's
been following me all day!"

165
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,952
I'll make a soufflé. If that doesn't
cheer him up, I don't know what will.

166
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,751
It's not like we can't live off my
paycheck. We have a hundred times.

167
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,639
Pink! Mine's pink today.
That's festive.

168
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:47,271
Man, I can't believe it.
I always wanted to fly a Falcon.

169
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:51,718
- Honey, how did you find me?
- They told me you were down here.

170
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,078
Mollie, this is Samantha D'Bonne,
my new boss.

171
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,958
How do you do?

172
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,633
I do just fine, thank you.

173
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,632
Oh, honey...

174
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,714
Congratulations.

175
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,439
This is my son, Mike.

176
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,030
- Hello.
- Sometimes he gets stuff on his hands.

177
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,034
- And my daughter, Julie.
- Hello, Julie.

178
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,032
Knock, knock.

179
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,518
- Who's there?
- Transsexual.

180
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,436
- What's it mean?
- It's an airline.

181
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,513
Excuse me.

182
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,237
So you work for Majique.
That's a big corporation.

183
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,232
Ms. D'Bonne is the president.

184
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,153
You're the president?
But you're so young.

185
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:36,439
- I'm 30. I'm practically past it.
- You can read about her in Fortune.

186
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,636
You're in Fortune?

187
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,236
Actually, it's two pages.

188
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,476
Hey! Mikey!

189
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,876
Wait! You'll end up in Guam.

190
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,634
- Get back here.
- I didn't do anything.

191
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,912
Oh, God. Honey.

192
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,032
They're a full-time job.

193
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,998
Did you get off early from work?

194
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,315
Yeah, I did.

195
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:00,273
- Was it an office party?
- I wouldn't call it a party.

196
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:03,830
You never get off early.
What did you do? VP! She got VP!

197
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,951
- Did you get VP?
- Not exactly.

198
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:10,637
This is great! What a day!
I get a job and you get... Oh, man!

199
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,828
- Let's talk at home.
- Give me the good news.

200
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,951
I was fired!

201
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,638
Oh, honey.

202
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,074
- What happened?
- I think it's because of the cutbacks.

203
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,437
I asked if it was my work
and they said no, it was great.

204
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,638
They said I was the best,
which is why I was most expensive.

205
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,271
I said, "What if I'd been better?
What would you have done? Shoot me?"

206
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,954
You're better than that company.

207
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,670
Nine years and they give me a cactus.

208
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,148
A cactus, honey.

209
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,233
Excuse me.
I couldn't help overhearing.

210
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,071
- Really?
- I'm terribly sorry.

211
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,038
Don't be. This is nothing.

212
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:56,630
Financially, you don't need to worry
about a thing. You see...

213
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,075
...l'm negotiating a merger
with Maxim Conti.

214
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,470
Next month alone,
we'll be flying to Rome...

215
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,631
...Paris, New Zealand...

216
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,440
I'll just keep him as busy as I can.

217
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,634
That makes me feel a lot better.

218
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,235
I'm sure you'll find something.

219
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,553
Oh, honey.

220
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,631
It'll be okay.

221
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,558
- Knock, knock.
- Nobody's home.

222
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,074
- Knock, knock.
- Nobody's home!

223
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:24,278
- Knock, knock.
- All right, who is it?

224
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,873
- Buck.
- Buck who?

225
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,076
Buck, buck, I'm a chicken!

226
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,231
Mom, can I kill her?

227
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,833
Not before dinner.

228
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,473
Knock, knock.

229
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,837
Don't torture your mother, honey.

230
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,833
He's cute.

231
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:49,634
What's going on?
Where are they taking everybody?

232
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,436
I'm scared! I'm going to pee.

233
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,272
Put him back. That's my brother.

234
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,070
He's so fuzzy.

235
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,038
Is that kibble on your hat?

236
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,834
I like you.

237
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,878
- Mommy, I want this one.
- All right.

238
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,429
Got any treats? I'm into treats.

239
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,438
It's just me, huh?

240
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,831
So nobody wants me?

241
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,832
What's wrong with me?

242
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,873
Okay, I drool more
than some of the other guys.

243
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,918
And I whine a little bit, sure.
Who doesn't?

244
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,831
You smell good. Like cookies.

245
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,030
And dirt. Can I go with you?
I like you. Please?

246
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,953
Mikey?

247
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,270
- Kid, take me.
- Michael, get over here.

248
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:41,080
Please? I'll eat shoelaces
and vegetables.

249
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,912
I'll even eat dog food.

250
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,479
Kid! Don't go away!

251
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,188
Where are you going?
Where did you go?

252
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,838
Bad smell.

253
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:53,430
You don't look like dog people.
You look like snake people.

254
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,838
Not the neck! I hate that.

255
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,439
He's kind of scrawny.

256
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,631
I've coughed hairballs
better-looking than you.

257
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,239
Take him, don't take him.

258
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,237
- Make up your mind.
- I'll take him.

259
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,233
Don't let happen to him
what happened to the gerbils.

260
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,948
Why don't I have a good feeling
about this?

261
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,353
So here they are.

262
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,830
My new masters.

263
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,039
Not!

264
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,714
Swallowed a bug!

265
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,836
Tuck and roll. Tuck and roll.

266
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,034
Big room. Wonder where the walls are.

267
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,754
Who needs masters?
I can take care of myself.

268
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,673
What kind of dog was that?

269
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,038
Maybe I do need a master.

270
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,676
How would you like to adopt
a cute little pup?

271
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,029
Same to you, pal.

272
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:52,636
He was too skinny.
Probably didn't have any good treats.

273
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:55,479
Now if I was food, where would I be?

274
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:58,678
In my stomach, because I would have
eaten me already.

275
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,831
Fatter people. This is good.

276
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:04,038
There's gotta be treats
around fat people.

277
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,390
Doggie dish at 12:00.
I'm coming in.

278
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,278
What's this, metal food?

279
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:11,080
Hey there, little fella.

280
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:14,437
- You hungry?
- Are you kidding? I just ate a nickel.

281
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,838
What a guy. What do you got?

282
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,474
Food? You going for food?

283
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,073
Let me see what's in there.

284
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,914
Get your hand away. I'll do it.
I got it.

285
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,231
I would like a Ferrari Testa Rossa...

286
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:40,479
...Alien Autopsy, a Super-Squirt
Phlegm Gun with laser sight...

287
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,836
...a helicopter...

288
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,234
...a space suit...

289
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,199
That goob's been up there
for an hour. Get him off.

290
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:50,757
I told you, Santa doesn't want you
to be a naughty girl.

291
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,433
Who are you, his mother?

292
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,559
No, I'm a Vulcan.

293
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:58,991
- How would you like a death grip?
- Yeah, right.

294
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,670
- A million dollars, a toy store...

295
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,593
- Mom!
- Mommy!

296
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:10,038
See? I told you Mommy had a big,
important job with Santa.

297
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:13,636
- Hey, no cuts!
- A spot. Tricked you.

298
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,839
Hello there, everyone!

299
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:31,034
Merry Christmas, everyone!

300
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,831
- You look hot.
- Yeah.

301
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:44,033
- How's it going?
- It's going bad. I hate children.

302
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,077
I used to love them. Now I hate them.

303
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,232
This music is driving me nuts.
I want to hurt Bing Crosby.

304
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,072
Something will come for you.

305
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:54,835
- 40 interviews and no one's hired me.
- Then it can only get better.

306
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,952
- Maybe next year I can be a reindeer.
- Look at the perks.

307
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,037
Hey, guys.

308
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,676
What are you standing there for?
Mom's personal best friend, Santa...

309
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,956
...is ready to see you. Come on.

310
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,792
There you go.

311
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,832
There we go.

312
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,878
Merry Christmas.

313
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,268
- Well, how are you today...
- Mikey.

314
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:21,115
...Mikey?
- You know me?

315
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:25,476
What would you like Santa
to bring you this Christmas?

316
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,030
- I want a dog.
- A dog? Well, that seems...

317
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,389
No.

318
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,636
You see, Mikey...

319
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,673
...even Santa doesn't control
some things.

320
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,954
Now somewhere out there
is the absolute perfect dog for you.

321
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,713
Maybe he's already been born.

322
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,270
Maybe he hasn't. But when he is...

323
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,476
...believe me, I'll know...

324
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,914
...and you'll get him!

325
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:52,277
- So I'll get him for Christmas?
- I'll do my best.

326
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:55,637
- Thanks, Santa.
- You're welcome, Mikey.

327
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,951
Here's Santa.

328
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,629
Hello, honey.

329
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,236
Mommy!

330
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:16,677
Santa is not mad at you.
Now listen to Teddy.

331
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,229
- Is Santa mad at Julie?
- No.

332
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,079
- Will Julie still get presents?
- Yes.

333
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,992
Give me kisses.

334
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:30,433
Come on, Julie. Cheer up.
How about a pre-Christmas present?

335
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:51,033
I have to get these shoes off.
My toes are curling.

336
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,229
Good night, Prancer.
Good night, Dancer.

337
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,236
What's the matter with you?

338
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,431
You don't know how to write?

339
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:08,116
Yeah? You gonna send some
monkey around to bust my knees?

340
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,431
Hey, all right.

341
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,558
I'll come up
with a couple of bills for you.

342
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,472
I was just kidding, okay?

343
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,393
Yeah, and a merry to you too.

344
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,829
You miserable sack of...

345
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,591
You're a fake!

346
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,633
- How could you let him see that?
- You were watching him.

347
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,029
I was calming Julie.

348
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:35,078
- What did Mikey see?
- Nothing, honey.

349
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,436
- You said he was real.
- I know, you see...

350
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:40,074
The real Santa's busy,
so he sends these...

351
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:43,909
- Cousins.
- That was Santa's cousin, Sidney Claus.

352
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,276
He's Jewish. He's his Jewish cousin.

353
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:49,159
But you said he was real.

354
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,514
All right, you chipmunks,
ready to sing your song?

355
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,830
- I'll say we are.
- Let's sing it now.

356
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,672
- Okay, Simon?
- Okay.

357
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,717
- Okay, Theodore?
- Okay.

358
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,757
Okay, Alvin?

359
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,639
Alvin?

360
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,151
- Alvin!
- Okay!

361
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,157
Oh, Mikey, Mikey.

362
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,233
What do you want?
You want a pizza pie?

363
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,795
Great. The Cornball Family.

364
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,436
It didn't work.

365
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:17,275
Honey, you used to love that song.

366
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,590
What can we do
to make you feel better?

367
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,150
Just tell me the truth.

368
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,311
There is no Santa, is there?

369
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,156
Yes. There is, honey.

370
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,833
But you know what it's like?

371
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:35,033
I'll tell you. You know how in
Cub Scouts you have den mothers?

372
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,229
Well, Santa has...

373
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,038
...den Santas.

374
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:41,272
Mike, you want to know the truth,
right?

375
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,034
You don't want us to lie to you...

376
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,032
...and this is the truth.

377
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,311
You know the whole thing about...

378
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,278
...the North Pole?

379
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,873
It's just a story.

380
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,958
It's just a story.

381
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,553
Santa is...

382
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,233
Santa is really...

383
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,674
...from Finland.

384
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,715
Finland.

385
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,354
Give me a break.

386
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,232
- No. He is.
- How could he...

387
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,351
...get around the world
in a night?

388
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,158
- Finland Airlines.
- Correct.

389
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,436
And how could reindeer fly?

390
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,755
Freight.

391
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,913
And how come Rudolph's nose glows?
What is he, radioactive?

392
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,438
Well, how come your
grandfather's nose glows?

393
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,030
I have the answer to this question.

394
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,354
Some things in life are magic.

395
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,670
Santa is magic.

396
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,439
Magic's for babies.

397
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,558
Honey, nice try.

398
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,234
Can I play?

399
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:24,552
- With me?
- Let's get busy.

400
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,073
New York Centre.

401
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:11,393
New York Centre, Fox Juliet,
flight level 4-1-0. Roger.

402
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,631
- Knock, knock.
- Hi.

403
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,633
How's the meeting?

404
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:25,238
We're all posturing, making threats.
Business as usual.

405
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,277
Zero-5-8. Roger.

406
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,909
We'll have to work
through this weekend.

407
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,435
Do you mind staying in Boston
a couple of days?

408
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,835
No.

409
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,274
I'll buy you dinner.

410
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,670
You don't have to. It's my job.

411
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,831
So you'll keep me feeling guilty.

412
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:43,350
Okay, but nothing fancy.
Just a paper napkin place.

413
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:47,158
Okay. Just don't sound
too thrilled about it, will you?

414
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,031
It's not that.

415
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,111
I was just thinking about Mikey.

416
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,952
- He's upset and...
- Why?

417
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,551
Mollie's gonna hate me for this...

418
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,519
...but I think we're looking
at the D word.

419
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,795
Divorce?

420
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,239
No.

421
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,833
Dog.

422
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,550
Watch it, pussy. I'm walking here.

423
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,268
Cats. Can't live with them,
can't eat them.

424
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,158
They're ruining this city.

425
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:24,678
Look at those. Extra crunchy.
Wrap them up, I'll take them to go.

426
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:28,037
Step on me, lady,
you get a nose in the crotch.

427
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,149
Hey, pal.

428
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,511
This was sitting on a park bench.

429
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,035
Next to some guy who was eating it.

430
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:39,750
Catch you later. I got a date
with a cute Pekingese on Park Avenue.

431
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:43,078
Face like a Mack truck,
but what a body.

432
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,834
What can I say? I'm a hound.

433
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,793
Gotcha. Come on now, boy.
No trouble.

434
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,753
Okay, I didn't mean
to steal that Frisbee.

435
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,878
I thought two calzones were mating!

436
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,314
Lousy dog cop!

437
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:03,238
Hey, liver. Jeez, I could
get used to this.

438
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,875
You got liver? Hey, fellas!

439
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,519
Spot here got liver.

440
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,831
- He got liver?
- That's a shame.

441
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:12,429
Already? That's a crock.

442
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,438
- What's wrong with liver?
- That's your last meal, amigo.

443
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,033
Then it's a big nap.

444
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,508
What did I do?

445
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,273
What did any of us do?

446
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,555
I bit a cop.

447
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,597
I got to talk to someone.

448
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,116
Too late. Here comes Dave.

449
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:38,280
Come on. Can't we work out
some kind of deal?

450
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,829
I got bones buried everywhere.
I'll share them!

451
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:44,635
- Hey, Dave. You big dumb clod!
- Hey, ugly!

452
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,751
You can't even pee right.

453
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,831
Can I take a dump in your hat?

454
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,629
Sorry, fella. It's time to go.

455
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,637
Don't let him see your fear.

456
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,110
Don't give him the satisfaction.

457
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,635
- Kill Dave!
- Kill Dave!

458
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,273
- What are we doing?
- We're going underwear shopping.

459
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,351
- I don't like underwear.
- You love it.

460
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,636
- I hate them.
- You love them.

461
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,551
Look alive, guys! We got masters!

462
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,033
Go ahead.

463
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,235
I'm neutered.
I've humped my last leg.

464
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,040
I will follow orders!

465
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:33,472
Yo, I can help you meet chicks.
I got this Lassie thing down.

466
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,836
You can call me Spot or Measles.

467
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,238
Hey, kid!

468
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:41,389
I do everything. Tricks! Roll over!

469
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,074
What about this guy?

470
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,276
Not a boy. I hate boys.

471
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,158
He looks pretty cool.

472
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,631
- He looks like a hot dog with ears.
- I resent that!

473
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,038
Here's the thing.
I got puppies out there.

474
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,470
Maybe. I don't know.
I've been around.

475
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:00,234
You know how it is. Give me a break.

476
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,675
I promise I'll go straight.

477
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:06,230
I'll even help out some blind guy
with a pencil cup.

478
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,633
I know that smell. Cookies and dirt.

479
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,831
- That's my kid!
- I said, let's move it.

480
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,155
Move on this.

481
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,914
Kid! You know me, don't you?

482
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,718
Get me out of here!

483
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,638
Him, Daddy. I want him.

484
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,030
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

485
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,636
You want him?

486
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,475
Here you go.

487
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:35,673
- We'll take him.
- This one's scheduled to be destroyed.

488
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:38,718
What? No way.
Take me, I'm yours!

489
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,471
- Well, he's been reprieved.
- Yes!

490
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,235
Okay, here we go.

491
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,431
- What are you gonna name him?
- Rocks.

492
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,477
Rocks? How come Rocks?

493
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,075
Because that's what he left
in the back seat.

494
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:57,151
Sorry about that.

495
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,038
Oh, man!

496
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,390
Here we are. This is where we live.

497
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,952
Warm. Dry. No puddles.

498
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:09,039
Wait a minute. Nice cushy thing
to sleep on. A little lumpy.

499
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,037
Maybe I'll just dig out the middle.

500
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,038
Honey, is that you?

501
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:20,994
Hello, James.

502
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,232
What's going on?

503
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:26,472
Samantha has brought us
a big surprise.

504
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,472
Really for Mikey and Julie.

505
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,236
What a tiny kennel.

506
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,510
I've seen enough.
Bring the car around.

507
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,069
Her name is Daphne.

508
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:42,869
She's purebred and trained
at the Radcliffe of obedience schools.

509
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,636
Radcliffe, wow.

510
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,759
Daphne, sit.

511
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,555
Voilà.

512
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:52,992
- Aerobics.
- But where's my personal trainer?

513
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,838
Isn't she a wonderful dog?

514
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:01,669
I'll have my manicure now, please.

515
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,036
- But I like Rocks bet...
- A dog!

516
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,793
A dog!

517
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,036
Mikey, wow. Finally, a dog.

518
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,356
Play with your rocks later.

519
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,956
But as I was just saying
to Samantha...

520
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:17,239
...we wouldn't dream of taking
her precious baby away from her.

521
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,630
And as I was telling Mollie...

522
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:22,075
...we're travelling so much...

523
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,517
...she doesn't get enough attention.
- I think it's a great idea.

524
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,432
Good.

525
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,590
Radcliffe, honey. Radcliffe.

526
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,670
Bye-bye, sweetheart.

527
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:39,753
Bye-bye? You can't leave me
with these people.

528
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,834
They haven't been properly trained,
or groomed, or...

529
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,036
I'm getting a migraine.

530
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,032
Goodbye, Mollie.

531
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:51,070
I'll be sending over her things.

532
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:53,629
- See you later, James.
- Thank you. Bye-bye.

533
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:56,155
Things? A dog has things?

534
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,628
She's just being nice.

535
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,752
The nerve! Coming in
and treating us like a kennel.

536
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,629
She dumps this dog on this family
without even consulting me?

537
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,073
Look what we got, Mom.

538
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:09,834
His name's Rocks.

539
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:14,596
Den. Don't even think
about loving on me, pal.

540
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,758
We already talked about this.

541
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,834
Yes, we talked but we didn't decide.
Now we have two dogs.

542
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:25,196
If I take Rocks back,
he'll be put to sleep.

543
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,793
Take...
What's her name?

544
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:29,508
- Daphne.
- Take Daphne back to Princess Di.

545
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:34,038
I can't insult Samantha.
This is the best job I've ever had.

546
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:38,159
This is your responsibility. You
brought these dogs here, you fix it.

547
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,630
Or I will fix you.

548
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,029
All right.

549
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:46,475
This is my chair, this is my cup...

550
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,393
...and this is my stinky
brother, Mikey.

551
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,119
Schwing!

552
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,278
Hello, baby!

553
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:57,115
Oh, my! What a set of paws.

554
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:00,118
Powder Puff, how about we nose
through the garbage?

555
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:03,710
- What cat dragged you in?
- The kid sprung me from the joint.

556
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:06,559
I don't associate with mutts.
I've got papers.

557
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:10,196
I been hit by those.
Hurts like hell, huh, Daffy?

558
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:13,039
It's Daphne, you tick magnet.

559
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:15,276
Jeez! Like you never sniffed a butt.

560
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,755
Why don't we keep them both for now.

561
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,752
The one that works out, stays.

562
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,753
The one that doesn't,
we find another home for.

563
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,470
- I don't know about that.
- Come on. Look how happy they are.

564
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,553
Wasrt there ever anything
you really wanted?

565
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,039
I'll never have breasts!

566
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,912
Oh, honey.

567
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:43,233
Okay. But the one that
we choose not to keep goes.

568
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,469
- Goes.
- Goes.

569
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,238
- Goes.
- Swear.

570
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:50,272
Don't. I don't want you
to love me yet. Not yet!

571
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,633
I'm telling you.
You're not in the clear, buddy.

572
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:56,350
Look! They like each other.

573
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,636
- Mongrel.
- Bitch.

574
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,269
Look, honey, they like each other.

575
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,076
I don't need a bath.
I just lick down there.

576
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,880
Trust me.
I smell worse wet than I do dry.

577
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:38,954
- Cut it out! I'm warning you.
- Quick, Mike, grab his tail.

578
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,956
What, no bubbles?

579
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,668
And I see there's no slice of lemon.

580
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,797
- Drink it.
- Take it away!

581
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,152
I don't know why they put my dish
up so high, but they serve good food.

582
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,356
Look at this cut of meat.

583
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,032
Here we go. Gonna play
"chase the meat" again.

584
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,674
Eating and running
are my two favourite things.

585
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:06,629
I'm gonna eat this meat
and save you the fat, big boy.

586
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,950
Bad dog! Stop!

587
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:12,433
I'm frizzing.
Brush while you blow, please.

588
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:15,837
Look at your hair. I can't believe
I trust you with mine.

589
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,236
What's this guy doing here?

590
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,916
Gonna get some treats from
the cabinet? Get some for me too.

591
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,318
Hit the clicker!

592
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:29,239
- Daphne, sit.
- Oh, no, it's way back like this.

593
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,429
Daphne, beg up.

594
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:32,471
- Start with one hand.
- Two hands.

595
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:33,789
If you insist.

596
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,070
Rocks, roll over.

597
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,630
Roll over, like this.

598
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:45,036
You guys are total entertainment.

599
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:47,629
It's better than chasing hubcaps.
Do it again.

600
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,159
- Julie, paw.
- Daphne, paw.

601
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,628
- Good girl.
- Good girl.

602
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:53,274
You're getting so much better.

603
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,990
- No!
- What?

604
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,679
No!

605
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,989
What?

606
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,555
- No!
- What?

607
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,556
Get that skinny man out my spaghetti.

608
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:12,473
- Someone's playing with their food.
- No, no!

609
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:15,632
Kid, shoot one of them round,
meaty things my way.

610
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,273
Begging is so gauche.

611
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,556
Come on, come through for me,
will you?

612
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:22,519
Come on, come on.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

613
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,199
Yes, he scores!

614
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,517
Hey! He threw a meatball!

615
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,551
- Squealer.
- Spaghetti face!

616
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:34,638
What is that?
Ice cream headache! Pain! Pain!

617
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,432
Sorry, guys.

618
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,433
Chicago.

619
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,836
You kids behave yourselves.

620
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,555
My poor nerves.

621
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:53,793
- Little high-strung, aren't we, Daffy?
- I'm just sensitive.

622
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:56,350
You've got that skeevy inbred look.

623
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,955
Mom knew her cousin
a little too well, huh?

624
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,395
Better than your mother
knew your father.

625
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,874
Put a sock in it.

626
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:05,634
I hope you won't be gone very long.

627
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:13,992
Hey, time for my walk, remember?
I'm getting kind of squirmy here.

628
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:20,228
Okay, you guys are busy.
I'll go right here, no problem.

629
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,351
- No!
- What is he doing?

630
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,109
Bad dog.

631
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,231
Right hand, green.

632
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:35,757
Unbelievably, incredibly,
endlessly bad dog!

633
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,952
I just marked that spot.
I'll do it again tomorrow.

634
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,678
- Hello?
- Hi, honey.

635
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,559
- How are you?
- This has been a week of hell.

636
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,155
- Is it Daphne?
- No, it's not Daphne.

637
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:10,073
It's that other moron, Rocks.
He pees all over...

638
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:14,757
- He'll grow out of that.
- All right, he also is a shoe gourmet.

639
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,713
He only eats Charles Jourdan,
never my tennis shoes.

640
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,519
Daddy.

641
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:39,632
I'm sorry. I wish I could be there.
I feel like I can train him.

642
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:42,678
Doctor Dolittle couldn't train
this dog.

643
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:46,833
So, what do you think, hon?
We should find him a new home?

644
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:51,797
- Oh, man! You win again!
- But of course.

645
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:55,270
No. I'll give him one more chance.

646
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:58,756
Great. If he chews anything else...

647
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,394
...he's gone. Okay?
- Okay.

648
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:06,394
I miss you. I'm excited about
seeing you tonight.

649
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:07,919
That's why I'm calling.

650
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:10,031
We're going to France tonight.

651
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,040
France? James...

652
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,953
...you've already been gone
for two whole weeks.

653
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,991
I've gotta go board now.

654
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,430
All right. I'll tell the kids.

655
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,832
Come say bye to Daddy.

656
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:30,070
Honey! What were you doing?

657
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,309
Flying.

658
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,829
Flying? Honey, you can't fly.

659
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:36,435
But those people can.

660
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:42,269
That is make-believe, honey. Remember
when we talked about make-believe?

661
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:46,069
The basketball man isn't make-believe
and they can fly.

662
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:48,919
Do you like them
because you think they can fly?

663
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:53,312
They can't fly, either.
But they can jump really high.

664
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,839
Daddy flies.

665
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:58,828
He does fly.
But, honey, he flies in an aeroplane.

666
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,634
Daddy doesn't fly... Daddy.

667
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,628
James?

668
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,435
James. Honey?

669
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,757
Rocks!

670
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:23,873
- I like yours.
- Yeah, it's so cute.

671
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,678
Where's your collage?

672
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:29,071
- Didrt do it.
- Miss Craig is gonna slime you.

673
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,276
- Big deal.
- Excuse me, ladies.

674
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,875
Why didn't you do your assignment?

675
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:38,875
It's stupid. We had to make a collage
of things we asked Santa for.

676
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,473
But there is no...

677
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:43,632
Don't say that in front of Julie
or anyone in class.

678
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:46,440
You don't want to upset
everybody, do you?

679
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,558
- It's the truth.
- What is?

680
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:52,236
Nothing, honey.
Mike, please, just do me this favour.

681
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,630
Don't say anything to anybody.

682
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:57,270
- Okay.
- All right! Bash Brothers!

683
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:00,074
- All right! We are Bash! We...
- Mom. Mom!

684
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,469
You're a girl.

685
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,909
Sorry. He'll be back soon.

686
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:29,479
- Did he win at the dog races?
- Ma.

687
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,950
Where'd he get the jacket? He looks...

688
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,839
- Hot. The word's "hot."
- Hot. Hot.

689
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:44,955
Excuse me. This is a special evening.
I'd like a bottle of Cristal.

690
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:47,358
And this is for the table.

691
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:49,278
He's picked up a few things.

692
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,196
What?

693
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,597
Six months in Miami, I return
to the The Twilight Zone.

694
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:01,437
You've had faith in me
all these years.

695
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:04,393
What better way to show my thanks
to my mother-in-law...

696
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:07,910
...than to...
- Rub her nose in it. I get it.

697
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:10,953
You made good. I'm impressed.
Okay?

698
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,669
Okay. Thank you.

699
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,431
Gentlemen, would you excuse me?

700
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,108
There's Samantha!

701
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,673
- Great.
- What?

702
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,071
I feel so schlumpy around her.
Do I have dog hair on me?

703
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,673
Hello, James.

704
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:33,434
This is my mother-in-law.
Rosie, Samantha.

705
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:35,915
- How do you do?
- Hello.

706
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:39,635
- And you know my wife, Mollie.
- Yes, of course, Mollie.

707
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:42,713
- Nice to see you again.
- Did you ever find a job?

708
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:46,955
I'm starving. Let's order.

709
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:48,275
Do try the duck.

710
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:51,637
Samantha ought to know.
She recommended the place.

711
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:52,876
You did?

712
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:56,439
How else would we get
into a place like this?

713
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:59,799
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

714
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,434
Have a lovely, lovely evening.

715
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:04,352
Nice jacket.

716
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:08,036
She's teasing me.
She bought this jacket for me.

717
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,439
She bought it for you?

718
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:13,075
We were in France,
at a fancy restaurant.

719
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:17,831
I couldn't wear my uniform, so she had
her driver buy me this jacket.

720
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,033
Of course.

721
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:25,033
Gosh, she forgot her pocketbook.
Hey, Samantha!

722
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:30,758
Is it just me, or was she...

723
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,036
I wanted to slap her teeth out.

724
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:34,468
It's obvious, isn't it?

725
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:37,473
She practically offered him
Taster's Choice.

726
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:39,073
I don't know what to do.

727
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:41,869
I know people.
We could have her audited.

728
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:45,239
That is not a good idea.
It's my fault anyway.

729
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:48,836
I pushed him to make him exactly
what I wanted him to be.

730
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:50,911
And now he is. I hate it.

731
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:52,951
He's a keeper. Talk to him.

732
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:54,753
I know it.

733
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,429
Can you excuse me?

734
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:59,438
Good. Make a scene.
Here, throw this in her face.

735
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:02,438
Ma, I am just gonna call the sitter.

736
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:08,469
Hello?

737
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:11,631
Yeah, everything's cool.

738
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:13,438
All right, bye.

739
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:18,272
You hooligans.

740
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,675
Well, what do you do for fun? Shed?

741
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:24,037
At least I don't have vermin
building condos in my fur.

742
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:28,199
At this rate, you won't have fur.
That kid's giving you a bald spot.

743
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:31,676
My mistress is kind.
Your child is demon spawn.

744
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:33,313
"Your child is demon spawn."

745
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:36,671
Quit brushing her.
She already looks like a Q-tip.

746
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,677
Your dog smells like a diaper.

747
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:41,030
- Does not.
- Diaper dog! Diaper dog!

748
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:42,639
Q-tip-head dog.

749
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:43,875
Stinky dog!

750
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:45,433
Bald-butted dog.

751
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:51,631
I got it! It's mine. No problem.

752
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:55,749
I'm homeless!

753
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:01,029
What happened?

754
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:02,593
You mongrel wretch!

755
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:05,792
- Get real. It's just a box, Daffy.
- Daphne!

756
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,274
Come on. I'm sorry.

757
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:10,512
- Look, I can fix it.
- I never want to see you again!

758
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,233
It'll be tough. I live here.

759
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,914
We'll just see about that!

760
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:16,155
Let's see.

761
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:21,235
She yells the most
when he gets the ones in boxes.

762
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:24,435
What does he see
in these smelly things?

763
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:29,191
Courage, Daphne, courage.
You'll be rid of him soon.

764
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:33,916
You think there's nothing weird about
buying someone dinner and clothing?

765
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:37,237
If a guy asks me to Le Cirque
and buys me a teddy, it's okay?

766
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:40,631
A jacket's not a teddy.
This is a teddy.

767
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:45,069
I'm trying not to be a shrew
and scream and hate her guts.

768
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:49,074
Although I wouldn't mind seeing
her decomposing body by the river.

769
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:51,754
You don't have to socialize with her.

770
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,070
Just keep your eyes on the road...

771
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:57,278
...or the sky or whatever you keep
your eyes on.

772
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:00,273
Answer me this:
Why is it that I can trust you...

773
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:03,637
...when you had an affair
with a married client?

774
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:06,832
That was 8 billion years ago!
I never see him.

775
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:10,470
How do I know that? I can only trust.
I have faith in you.

776
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:13,478
You don't have much faith
if you keep bringing it up.

777
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:18,435
I don't keep on bringing...
Oh, honey, listen to us.

778
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:20,631
After six years, we're still jealous.

779
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:23,229
- Isn't that good?
- I don't know.

780
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,470
It's you I like. It's not Samantha.

781
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:29,153
I like you.

782
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:32,437
Honey, I'm crazy about you.
I love you so much.

783
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:36,639
Watch out for her. She's real flirty.
I know about girls like that.

784
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:38,233
I was one.

785
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:41,314
- Okay. I promise.
- Okay.

786
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:46,356
He did it!

787
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:48,591
Mom, it was her fault.

788
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,035
I'll put them to bed.

789
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:54,636
Honey, don't ruin it.
Don't ruin the moment.

790
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:02,476
- I don't want to go.
- You have to go.

791
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:05,837
- But you don't trust me.
- I do. I do trust you.

792
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:09,231
I don't trust her.

793
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:13,671
You two, come on.

794
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:02,950
Hi, honey.

795
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:04,832
- Where are you?
- I'm in London.

796
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:06,951
I'm in San Francisco, honey.

797
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:08,639
I'm in Reno.

798
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:11,953
We're in Dallas.

799
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:15,510
What do you mean I'm being audited?
It's not even tax season!

800
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:38,031
Mom? Where's Dad?

801
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:39,838
He'll be home soon.

802
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:43,234
Will he be here for Christmas?

803
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:47,270
Your dad wouldn't miss Christmas
for all the stars in the sky.

804
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:49,238
What about the moon?

805
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:52,832
The moon too.

806
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:55,069
Bedtime.

807
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:56,833
Bedtime.

808
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:06,640
- I love you.
- I love you too.

809
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:14,835
Good night.

810
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:09,829
- She thinks we're in Dallas?
- She bought it.

811
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:11,832
- Dumb cow!
- Dumb cow!

812
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:29,435
And what do you want
for Christmas, little boy?

813
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:35,356
Well, Mollie...

814
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:38,512
...I never asked you what you want
for Christmas.

815
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:44,195
Santa, I can't think of any present
I'd rather have than you.

816
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:48,679
Oh, Albert!

817
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:54,232
Come here, you studmuffin!

818
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:30,232
Honey, what are we doing?

819
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:34,269
I don't know. This isn't us.
We'd never do this.

820
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:36,272
Do you think we're dreaming?

821
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:39,432
I think it's one
where you know you're dreaming.

822
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:47,916
Excuse me,
but we were having an affair.

823
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:52,436
Does this mean we can do
whatever we want to do in the dream?

824
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:55,356
Excuse me.

825
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:08,840
You see that?
I told you they werert real.

826
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:17,439
Honey, you know I can't dance.

827
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:19,949
You can dance. This is our dream.

828
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:29,076
Oh, James.

829
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:32,153
Ex cuse me. Mistress?
Please wake up.

830
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:35,836
I need to be walked quite badly
as a matter of fact.

831
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:38,435
Oh, well, I'm a lady. I can hold it.

832
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:41,837
No, I can't, I'm desperate!
Oh, God, she's in a coma.

833
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:43,314
Please wake up!

834
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:47,479
I can't have an accident like
a common mutt. It's too demeaning.

835
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:50,917
Baby, you are so jumpy.
Let her alone. She looks happy.

836
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:52,758
Well, what am I supposed to do?

837
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:55,112
- I'll take you out.
- But how?

838
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:56,828
Come on.

839
00:53:57,600 --> 00:54:00,068
But we need a master to open the door.

840
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:01,639
Want to bet?

841
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:04,669
How did you do that?

842
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:06,876
I know things not taught in school.

843
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:08,951
Ex cuse me. I was valedictorian.

844
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:10,679
Give it up, kid. Come on!

845
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:12,029
What about my leash?

846
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:14,231
You haven't lived
till you try it naked.

847
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:16,118
Don't get fresh!

848
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:22,469
- How about dinner out?
- I'm not hungry.

849
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:26,633
You dolls always say that.
Forget your diet. Let's get Italian.

850
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:30,077
No. I'm so fat these days,
I look like an English sheepdog.

851
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:31,793
You nuts? You look great.

852
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,913
When I was young, I had one
of those greyhound hardbodies.

853
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:39,396
- What do you mean? You're a kid.
- Well, I'm pushing 7.

854
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:42,114
Seven?
You don't look a day over 5.

855
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:45,392
Do you really think so?
Well, maybe a little Chinese.

856
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:47,431
I know just the place. Follow me.

857
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:52,760
Wait until you taste
their moo goo gai pan.

858
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,752
- Great.
- Hope it's on the menu.

859
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,275
But wait. Where are the dog dishes?

860
00:54:57,480 --> 00:54:59,118
We don't need no dog dishes.

861
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:01,629
- What are you doing?
- Getting us takeout.

862
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,035
How clever.

863
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:06,757
The green tea ice cream goes great
with lobster sauce.

864
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,831
- Oh, ex cuse me.
- Good, huh?

865
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:13,949
What do you think
about the world at large?

866
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:18,631
I must admit, there's a certain
exhilaration to this leash-less state.

867
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:22,879
When I think about it, Samantha
never let me run free, or petted me...

868
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:27,238
...or played with me. Actually, I
never liked her. You know what else?

869
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:31,831
I hate this haircut.
My butt is freezing!

870
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:35,232
Nice butt.
No offense, no offense!

871
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:40,429
It's getting bright out.
We should get back.

872
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:43,632
- It's only the shank of the evening.
- We really should.

873
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:45,836
All right. I know a shortcut.

874
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:48,190
- Through that?
- Yeah.

875
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:49,799
Wait a minute. What is it?

876
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,639
Mud. You never seen mud before?

877
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:56,116
It's mud. When the wet stuff
comes down and hits the dirt.

878
00:55:56,840 --> 00:55:58,956
- Dirt?
- Oh, you have been sheltered.

879
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:01,919
I won't lie:
It's not the highlight of our evening.

880
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:04,680
Just gotta grit your teeth
and slog through it.

881
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:08,839
Oh, no, no, no. There is absolutely
no possible way I could...

882
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:11,189
Firm...

883
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:14,119
...yet squishy.

884
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:15,634
Yeah. I'm sorry.

885
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:18,474
Sorry? I like it!

886
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:22,110
The oozy gooey-ness of it. It's so...

887
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:23,673
...sensual!

888
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:26,309
- It's glorious!
- It's mud.

889
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:28,234
- Play with me!
- Now?

890
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:30,476
Play with me in the mud!

891
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:32,636
You're a wild thing!

892
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:39,428
This is totally filthy!

893
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:49,557
By the way, I never asked you...
What's your name?

894
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:51,637
Me? They call me "No."

895
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:56,755
Silly. "No" isn't your name!
That's what they say when you're bad.

896
00:56:57,120 --> 00:57:00,237
No. What's another word they say
all the time to you?

897
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:02,272
There's that "Rocks" thing.

898
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:04,869
Rocks! That's it.
That's your name.

899
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:07,111
You are one smart cookie, you know?

900
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:08,673
You finally noticed.

901
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:11,434
Well, be cool.
Here comes the doorman.

902
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:18,590
Permit me to walk you to your door.

903
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:20,671
I almost hate for this to end.

904
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:24,994
Well, Rocks, thank you
for a wonderful evening.

905
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:27,191
It's so ex citing out there.

906
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:30,513
But it's nice to have
a warm place to come back to.

907
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:35,192
Where you don't fight for food,
and people don't throw you into trucks.

908
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:37,630
- You mean home?
- Is that what this is?

909
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:39,273
It's our home.

910
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:41,677
Yeah. Home.

911
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:44,189
- I like the ring of that.
- No!

912
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:49,155
Rocks! You have eaten
your last shoe around this house!

913
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:50,958
- Oh, no.
- What'd I do?

914
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:53,634
- You are out of here!
- No!

915
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:57,190
Mike, hold on.
Honey, open the door.

916
00:57:57,560 --> 00:58:00,393
Mike, will you please open the door?

917
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:02,556
I want Daddy!

918
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:08,191
Merry Christmas, guys.

919
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:11,989
Merry Christmas, Tom.
Merry Christmas, Dave.

920
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:15,550
Merry Christmas, Samantha.

921
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:21,154
Oh, dear.
This is going to be difficult.

922
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:24,756
I spoke to Conti. After swearing
he'd keep all our people...

923
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:27,030
...he now won't go through
with the merger...

924
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:29,151
...unless I let go of 3000 of them.

925
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:32,272
You're kidding.
Well, can't you do anything about it?

926
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:36,355
Well, I have this one chance.
He has this cabin upstate.

927
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:40,758
He wants me to go there,
plead my case this afternoon.

928
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:45,229
Oh, Samantha, it's Christmas Eve.
I can't.

929
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:47,192
I know. Believe me, I know.

930
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:51,279
If there was any other way,
but, I mean, 3000 people?

931
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:55,790
Be right back. Ralph!

932
00:58:57,920 --> 00:58:59,990
Ralph, you're current
on the Falcon, right?

933
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:01,394
No. No way.

934
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:04,108
- Don, I know you are.
- Christmas Eve, man.

935
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:06,550
- Bill, I'll give you $500.
- I can't.

936
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:08,557
- 600.
- Hell, I'll do it.

937
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:10,233
- 750.
- We're married.

938
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:13,352
We want to stay that way.
Jerry might do it. He's single.

939
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:15,551
Too late. He's on the runway.

940
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:19,796
Jerry! Stop! Jerry, stop!

941
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:28,356
Honey, I'm really sorry.

942
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:32,038
I did everything I could
to try to get out of this.

943
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:34,595
My parents will be here
in less than an hour.

944
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:38,435
I'm still peeling potatoes and
a sock's stuck in the garbage disposal.

945
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:40,392
I'll take care of it later.

946
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:43,751
And I'll be there for dinner,
I promise.

947
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:45,268
Can I talk to Mikey?

948
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:49,155
Yes. Mike, it's your dad!

949
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:56,192
- Hello.
- Hey, Mike.

950
00:59:56,720 --> 01:00:00,269
I know that you're not feeling
so good right now, but...

951
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:01,515
When will you be home?

952
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:03,712
I'll be home very soon.

953
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:05,189
I want you now.

954
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:06,594
I want to be there too.

955
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:10,349
Hey, do you think Santa would
keep us apart on Christmas Eve?

956
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:13,109
I mean, no way. Right?

957
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:15,359
Here's Julie.

958
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:18,949
Hi, Daddy.

959
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:21,231
- Knock, knock.
- Who's there?

960
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:22,555
- Mary.
- Mary who?

961
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:24,478
Merry Christmas, Daddy!

962
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:31,549
- Hi, Rocks.
- How you doing, kid?

963
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:35,156
I'm sorry.
Mom won't let you in the house.

964
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:38,119
It's not like I never spent
the night outside before.

965
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:42,395
Why'd you have to go
and chew on her shoes?

966
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:45,910
It was me, Rocks. I did it.

967
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:48,356
- I set you up.
- I know.

968
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:53,198
But it was before we...
Oh, I'd give anything to take it back.

969
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:55,556
Mom says you have to go away.

970
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:59,759
It was only a matter of time.
This home stuff was too good to last.

971
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:03,357
Mom says someday
I can get another dog.

972
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:07,835
But I don't want another dog.
You're my dog.

973
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:12,190
It's okay, kid.
I don't belong here.

974
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:15,392
You're nice people.
You deserve a classy dog like Daph.

975
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:17,232
She's got looks, brains.

976
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:19,556
Brains aren't everything.

977
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:23,559
I may not be smart,
but I know I'm out of here.

978
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:26,997
You are smart. If you'd pay
attention, you could learn...

979
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:28,792
...everything they'd want you to.

980
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,389
What do you mean, tricks?
It's too late.

981
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:34,837
Not with America's most
overtrained dog as your teacher.

982
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:47,951
- Well, here we are.
- Do you mind if I use the phone?

983
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:52,154
Oh, no. There's one downstairs
in the kitchen, to the right.

984
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:08,195
This line is dead.
Do you have another line?

985
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:12,353
There's a fax machine here.
Oh, what's this?

986
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:16,952
It's from Conti. You read it.
I can't see without my glasses.

987
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:21,596
"Wort be in until late tonight,
possibly first thing tomorrow.

988
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:24,354
Don't leave.
Please make yourself at home."

989
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:26,234
Oh, man.

990
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:30,149
- This is dead too.
- Damn!

991
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:32,157
I gotta go.
I better stop the driver.

992
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:34,550
- He's gone.
- He's gone?

993
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:37,995
I can't miss my family's Christmas.

994
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:41,357
James, I feel absolutely
ghastly about this.

995
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:42,794
Scotch?

996
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:47,432
Let's start with something easy.
"Sit" is very popular.

997
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:49,312
- You've heard it?
- Sounds familiar.

998
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:52,751
Okay. Front paws stiff.
Butt on floor.

999
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:54,678
That's all there is to it.

1000
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:56,956
That's what they've
been babbling about?

1001
01:02:57,200 --> 01:03:00,556
What can I say? It's a power trip.
Uh-oh, busted.

1002
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:03,917
Hey, kid's mom!
Let's do the "sit" thing.

1003
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:05,838
Hey, come over here. Ask me.

1004
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:08,753
What's with you?

1005
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:11,598
You're being affectionate?

1006
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,149
Try guilty.

1007
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:17,995
Well, you do have
a sweet side, don't you?

1008
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:19,559
Yeah.

1009
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:21,358
Please don't send Rocks away.

1010
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:25,718
Here! Over here! Look, look, see?
I got this "sit" thing nailed.

1011
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:29,037
He's decent, loyal.
Everything I'm not.

1012
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:30,229
What?

1013
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:32,956
What, do you miss Rocks?

1014
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,194
I thought you hated him.

1015
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:37,550
Once you get past the fleas,
he's charming.

1016
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:40,189
That's the way it goes, isn't it?

1017
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:42,550
First, you think
they're not good enough.

1018
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:47,759
Then they grow on you,
and then you can't live without them.

1019
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:50,278
Ain't it the truth.

1020
01:03:56,240 --> 01:03:59,710
Look, I'm just gonna walk into town
and rent a car, okay?

1021
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:01,478
I'll be home in a few hours.

1022
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:04,678
Okay, whatever you want to do, but...

1023
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:07,912
...do you think you ought
to walk 10 miles in that?

1024
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:30,349
That's him! That's my husband!

1025
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:49,117
Oh, yeah? Well, a Merry Christmas
to you too, you rude bimbo!

1026
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:50,992
There's the holiday spirit.

1027
01:04:51,240 --> 01:04:54,198
Samantha's office won't give me
the number where they are.

1028
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:56,749
They're treating me
like I'm some wacko!

1029
01:04:58,520 --> 01:04:59,748
I know what I'll do.

1030
01:04:59,960 --> 01:05:04,511
I'll call Mr. Conti. I bet his
secretary will tell me where they are.

1031
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:12,990
Mr. Conti's office.

1032
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:15,792
What cabin?

1033
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:20,158
I'm sorry.
There must be some mistake.

1034
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:24,552
Mr. Conti is in the Bahamas
with his family.

1035
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:34,594
James better hurry.
That bird's ready to come out.

1036
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:38,355
He doesn't need to hurry, Mother.
He's having an affair.

1037
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,798
- What?
- There is no meeting.

1038
01:05:42,040 --> 01:05:45,271
He and Ms. Fortune 500
are shacked up...

1039
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:47,198
...in some cabin upstate.

1040
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:51,558
So while I am here, peeling
thousands of little pearl onions...

1041
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:55,759
...because he loves them, he's having
an affair on Christmas Eve.

1042
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:59,879
Come on, now.
You don't believe that.

1043
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:02,350
Well, Mother, what would you believe?

1044
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:05,597
Sweetie, you remember in the war...

1045
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:09,469
...when your father's ship was shelled
and he was on that island?

1046
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:13,679
For 17 days, then he was rescued.
What does that have to do with this?

1047
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:17,390
What you don't know was
he was on that island alone...

1048
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:20,359
...with 13 USO girls.

1049
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:23,751
God forbid, it wasrt Bob Hope.

1050
01:06:24,040 --> 01:06:26,156
Those girls had been
around the block...

1051
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:30,757
...and remember, your father was
a devastatingly handsome man.

1052
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:34,193
That's beautiful.

1053
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:41,871
Go on, Mother. So, what happened?

1054
01:06:42,120 --> 01:06:44,588
Nothing. At least
he swore nothing happened.

1055
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:46,756
Said they played gin rummy
the whole time.

1056
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,389
- And you believed him?
- Of course not.

1057
01:06:49,640 --> 01:06:50,959
Well, Mother!

1058
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:53,879
Now, wait.
Later I met some of the girls.

1059
01:06:54,120 --> 01:06:58,398
It turned out that he hadrt
played gin rummy the whole time.

1060
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:00,551
All he did the whole time...

1061
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:03,115
...was talk about me.

1062
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:06,153
And I believed them.

1063
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:10,551
Now, in your heart...

1064
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:15,157
...do you really believe that
James would cheat on you?

1065
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:31,152
Well, James, since we're stuck here,
we might as well relax.

1066
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:34,829
Isn't it great?

1067
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:42,714
This isn't good.

1068
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:43,989
What?

1069
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:47,239
What is this?
This all seems like some kind of...

1070
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:48,953
Some sort of what?

1071
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:57,876
Oh, I'm so embarrassed.

1072
01:07:58,120 --> 01:08:01,112
You think I planned this
as some sort of... Oh, God.

1073
01:08:01,320 --> 01:08:05,996
God, I'm wrong! Oh, man! To even
think you'd go for a guy like me!

1074
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:07,229
Sit down.

1075
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:11,319
I am so stupid!
You probably have someone like...

1076
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:14,557
...Prince Charles in a condo,
waiting for you somewhere.

1077
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:19,191
No. And no, I didn't have
any plans for tonight.

1078
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:22,995
You're kidding. You were actually
going to be alone for Christmas?

1079
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:25,795
- I'm used to it.
- I can't believe it.

1080
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:28,713
When I was little,
I was usually at boarding school.

1081
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:30,314
Where were your folks?

1082
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:34,269
- Oh, I don't know. Skiing.
- Instead of being with their kid?

1083
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:39,272
Their parents did it to them,
they did it to me. It was fine.

1084
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:43,354
I also had a lot of advantages.
I went to the best schools.

1085
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:46,194
I could speak 4 languages
by the time I was 15.

1086
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:49,754
When I was 15,
I was flunking English.

1087
01:08:50,440 --> 01:08:52,396
I suppose I did wonder about...

1088
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:56,349
Well, you know,
regular high school. Boys.

1089
01:08:57,240 --> 01:09:00,357
- Dances. That kind of thing.
- You didn't go to dances?

1090
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:03,950
No. If I'm really honest,
I actually don't know how.

1091
01:09:04,160 --> 01:09:05,957
Come on. Everybody can dance.

1092
01:09:06,160 --> 01:09:07,991
- Everybody cannot dance!
- They can.

1093
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:10,515
- No, they cannot!
- It's easy.

1094
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:16,394
What's wrong?

1095
01:09:16,680 --> 01:09:17,669
Nothing.

1096
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:19,393
He's not coming, is he?

1097
01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:22,752
Oh, honey, he's trying real hard
to get back tonight.

1098
01:09:23,240 --> 01:09:25,196
I knew it. He's not coming back.

1099
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:29,558
Let's go and open some of the gifts
that Grandma and Grandpa brought.

1100
01:09:29,760 --> 01:09:31,432
I'm sure Santa wouldn't mind.

1101
01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:33,551
- There is no Santa!
- What?

1102
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:35,758
There is no Santa.

1103
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,228
Now, you stop that!

1104
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:40,557
If there was, wouldn't he
let Daddy be with us?

1105
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:44,589
- What's wrong? Where's Daddy?
- Oh, sweetie!

1106
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:46,751
I want my daddy.

1107
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:48,319
Christmas stinks.

1108
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:51,438
Everybody just hold it!
I think I have an idea.

1109
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:55,793
Let's open some presents.
Look what's in this. Open this one.

1110
01:09:56,040 --> 01:09:57,917
- I don't want one.
- I'll have it.

1111
01:09:58,120 --> 01:09:59,951
Ms. D'Bonne's office, please.

1112
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:05,069
Hello. I am calling
from Olympic Florist...

1113
01:10:05,320 --> 01:10:08,551
...and I have 350 red
long-stemmed roses...

1114
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:10,711
...to deliver to Ms. D'Bonne.

1115
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:12,952
I need the address, please.

1116
01:10:13,240 --> 01:10:14,958
They're coming from a Mr...

1117
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:18,397
...James Ubriacco, Ubri...

1118
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:21,757
Yeah, doll, that's it. That's it.

1119
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:28,351
Good. Thanks, doll.
And a Merry Christmas to you too.

1120
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:29,834
Sucker.

1121
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:32,954
Kids, listen to Mommy.
Go in your rooms...

1122
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:35,754
...and put on warm clothes.
We're taking a trip.

1123
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,355
Daddy, will you
put the presents in the car?

1124
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:43,151
Ma, will you put the onions in some
Tupperware? Come on, let's move it!

1125
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:47,757
Go! Daddy won't come to Christmas,
Christmas will come to Daddy.

1126
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:03,115
Rocks, I don't feel so good.

1127
01:11:03,320 --> 01:11:06,232
It's fun. It's chasing
without the stupid running.

1128
01:11:06,440 --> 01:11:08,715
I'm going to lose my Kibbles 'n Bits.

1129
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:17,634
What's this?

1130
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:21,197
Touch a present and you'll be
hunting gophers for dinner.

1131
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:36,119
I smell fruitcake!

1132
01:11:36,360 --> 01:11:38,749
- That's gotta be fruitcake.
- Rocks, I said no!

1133
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:41,237
Mom. Mom, look out!

1134
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:50,197
Don't worry. Mommy's just playing.

1135
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:54,358
Hang on!

1136
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:58,989
Stop this thing!

1137
01:12:10,240 --> 01:12:12,515
Are you okay?
Are you okay, honey?

1138
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:13,955
Is everybody okay?

1139
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:17,556
All right, good.
Now, wasrt that fun?

1140
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:18,949
No.

1141
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:20,474
No. All right.

1142
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:24,549
Okay. Well, tell you
what we're gonna do.

1143
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:27,793
Mommy's gonna figure out
how to get us out of here.

1144
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:30,392
- I got an idea.
- What?

1145
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:32,557
You push and I drive.

1146
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:35,837
Really? Good. You have
your driver's license with you?

1147
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:37,396
No.

1148
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:40,478
Okay, good try.
I know. I have an idea.

1149
01:12:40,720 --> 01:12:44,998
Look, there's lots of pine cones here.
I'm gonna gather some up for us.

1150
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:47,754
- And while I do that...
- I don't like pine cones.

1151
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,558
Oh, you don't?

1152
01:12:50,120 --> 01:12:52,680
Well, okay,
then I will get you a stick.

1153
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:55,957
And then you guys sing
and guard the presents, okay?

1154
01:12:56,200 --> 01:12:59,556
So sing a nice loud Christmas song
so Mommy can hear you.

1155
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:15,956
Now what am I gonna do?

1156
01:13:23,720 --> 01:13:26,393
Will you stop messing me up!

1157
01:13:45,680 --> 01:13:47,432
Meals on wheels.

1158
01:13:47,720 --> 01:13:49,870
Mommy found another doggie.

1159
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:51,149
That's no dog.

1160
01:13:51,400 --> 01:13:53,789
Hey, mama,
on your way to Grandma's house?

1161
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:56,758
Hey, you! Beat it!

1162
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:02,320
Ooh, I love the smell of fear.

1163
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:04,158
Nice wolf.

1164
01:14:05,320 --> 01:14:06,958
I won't hurt you.

1165
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:10,554
Nice wolf.

1166
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:14,079
I like wolves.

1167
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:20,276
Let me out of here! Let me out!

1168
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:21,276
Nice wolf.

1169
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:24,439
Come on, come on.

1170
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:33,352
Just leave the lady alone, unless
you want to get spayed the hard way.

1171
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:37,396
He talks the talk,
but can he walk the walk?

1172
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:41,555
Back off, this ain't your business.

1173
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:43,950
The hell it ain't.
That's my family.

1174
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:47,749
Remember when Mommy told you
the story about Peter and the wolf?

1175
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:52,755
Well, there's the wolf. Where is
that crazy Peter when you need him?

1176
01:15:05,560 --> 01:15:07,118
Rocks!

1177
01:15:33,080 --> 01:15:35,116
Rocks! Oh, no! No!

1178
01:15:39,720 --> 01:15:40,914
Rip his throat out!

1179
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:45,395
Ow! My tail!

1180
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:48,712
Never mess with
a street dog, you wuss.

1181
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:02,437
Rocks, you're hurt!
Look at your paws and your ears.

1182
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:06,155
Your little ears. And your neck.
What did that animal do to you?

1183
01:16:06,360 --> 01:16:08,157
- It's nothing.
- Oh, sweetheart.

1184
01:16:08,360 --> 01:16:10,635
Sweetheart? Oh, baby!

1185
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,150
Hey, I smell kid's dad.
Up this way.

1186
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:17,469
The master?

1187
01:16:17,680 --> 01:16:19,955
But you're hurt.
Come back to the car.

1188
01:16:20,160 --> 01:16:22,799
- We gotta get them help.
- Then I'm going too.

1189
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:26,157
- No, you're a house dog.
- I've still got my animal instincts.

1190
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:28,675
All right. Go back
that way and get help.

1191
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:31,354
All right. Which way?

1192
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:34,393
- You gotta sniff for people.
- Sniff?

1193
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:36,995
- Stick your nose in the air and suck.
- What?

1194
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:40,351
Mommy's gotta go get the dogs
before they run away.

1195
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:44,156
- Take care of yourself.
- Don't worry about me.

1196
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:46,192
Sniff. No, that's snort.

1197
01:16:48,120 --> 01:16:49,951
Rocks! Here, boy!

1198
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:51,394
Come on, guys!

1199
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:54,154
- Where'd they go?
- Daphne! Here, girl!

1200
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:56,191
Maybe they went to the bathroom.

1201
01:16:56,440 --> 01:16:59,750
They should have gone to
the bathroom before we left, right?

1202
01:16:59,960 --> 01:17:01,359
That's right.

1203
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:03,159
Rocks, come back!

1204
01:17:03,400 --> 01:17:05,960
- Daphne!
- Let's get back in the car.

1205
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:07,997
- He'll come back.
- Come back, girl.

1206
01:17:08,240 --> 01:17:11,198
I'll let you open a present.
Whichever one you want.

1207
01:17:11,440 --> 01:17:12,953
But Rocks is hurt!

1208
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:15,839
Honey, he'll be fine.

1209
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:18,031
Six, seven...

1210
01:17:18,280 --> 01:17:19,998
...eight and slow.

1211
01:17:20,240 --> 01:17:21,992
Quick, quick, slow.

1212
01:17:22,240 --> 01:17:23,992
Quick, quick, slow.

1213
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:30,238
Good. Quick, quick, slow. Good.

1214
01:17:32,240 --> 01:17:34,549
Excellent. Good.

1215
01:17:47,640 --> 01:17:50,393
- See, you can dance.
- But how do we do it like this?

1216
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:53,359
Well, you just do it the same way.

1217
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:54,596
Slow.

1218
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:56,876
Quick, quick, slow.

1219
01:17:57,120 --> 01:17:59,031
Quick, quick, slow.

1220
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:04,955
I think I'm sniffing.
I'm inaling and I'm getting nothing.

1221
01:18:05,200 --> 01:18:08,431
I'm just an inbred washout.
I can't even smell... People!

1222
01:18:11,240 --> 01:18:12,070
I did it!

1223
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:16,199
I can sniff! I am not a poodle,
I am a wild, marauding beast!

1224
01:18:17,720 --> 01:18:19,756
Move it! My masters need help.

1225
01:18:40,160 --> 01:18:42,879
The phone is out, huh?
You are unbelievable.

1226
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:45,156
How dare you treat me like that?

1227
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:47,555
Easy. You're a lousy human being.

1228
01:18:50,160 --> 01:18:54,756
Listen to me, James.
You are a very impressive man.

1229
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,753
Over the past few months,
I have watched you bloom.

1230
01:18:57,960 --> 01:18:59,996
You deserve better than some...

1231
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:03,198
...frumpy housewife who doesn't
have the resourcefulness...

1232
01:19:03,400 --> 01:19:05,311
...to find herself a decent job.

1233
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:10,593
She's smart enough to find me here.
That's our dog!

1234
01:19:14,760 --> 01:19:18,878
- Hey, Rocks. All right.
- Hey, big guy. Hey, pal, give me paw.

1235
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:21,998
- What happened?
- Not so rough.

1236
01:19:22,200 --> 01:19:24,509
Whoa! Is she in heat, or what?

1237
01:19:28,240 --> 01:19:31,676
If you walk out that door,
I will personally guarantee...

1238
01:19:31,880 --> 01:19:33,313
...that you never fly...

1239
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:37,149
...for a reputable company
for the rest of your pathetic...

1240
01:19:39,160 --> 01:19:42,277
How do you like that?
That'll cool you off.

1241
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:45,069
Rocks, let's go.

1242
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:46,599
Good shot, huh?

1243
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:49,549
Bye.

1244
01:19:55,520 --> 01:19:57,078
It's a hat.

1245
01:19:57,320 --> 01:20:00,153
It's a hat. Let's put it on.

1246
01:20:01,160 --> 01:20:02,798
I think it goes a different way.

1247
01:20:03,240 --> 01:20:06,550
Let's see. You look so pretty!

1248
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:12,118
Look at that face!
Mikey, you want to open another one?

1249
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:14,678
It's probably more clothes.

1250
01:20:14,920 --> 01:20:17,150
You're lucky we gave you
some boring things.

1251
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:20,551
Otherwise, you'd be freezing
your tushy off right now.

1252
01:20:25,720 --> 01:20:27,358
Is that Daphne?

1253
01:20:30,160 --> 01:20:33,596
My God! My dog is a genius!

1254
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:35,512
Way to go, Daphne!

1255
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:38,752
No need for applause.
Just throw treats.

1256
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:41,157
Come on, we're almost there.

1257
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:45,437
Okay, Rocks, where are they?
Are we getting close?

1258
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:48,110
Are we? Right.

1259
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:50,788
What are you gonna say?
"They're just up the road...

1260
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:53,759
...about a quarter of a mile,
just past the 7-11."

1261
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:56,029
This way.

1262
01:20:56,240 --> 01:21:00,677
Are you gonna trust that dinky bulb
on your face or my nose? Come on!

1263
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:03,155
All right. I hope you're right.

1264
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,958
Mollie! Mollie!

1265
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:15,760
Oh, God. Mollie!

1266
01:21:17,240 --> 01:21:18,992
They're gone? I can't believe it.

1267
01:21:19,240 --> 01:21:22,073
Look on the floor. They were here.
I left them here.

1268
01:21:35,120 --> 01:21:36,348
Come on in.

1269
01:21:39,240 --> 01:21:41,959
There are some cots
in the back you could use.

1270
01:21:42,160 --> 01:21:46,153
No, thank you. We can't sleep here.
We have to find my husband tonight.

1271
01:21:46,360 --> 01:21:48,032
No one's going anywhere tonight.

1272
01:21:48,440 --> 01:21:51,398
You hunker down here.
We'll go out in the morning.

1273
01:21:51,640 --> 01:21:54,234
We have to go.
This is Christmas Eve. We've gotta...

1274
01:21:54,440 --> 01:21:55,555
I'm sorry.

1275
01:21:56,840 --> 01:21:59,513
If it's any consolation,
I have cookies and eggnog.

1276
01:21:59,720 --> 01:22:01,438
You can help yourselves.

1277
01:22:02,720 --> 01:22:03,948
Thank you.

1278
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:20,791
I'm sorry, you guys.

1279
01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:24,271
I didn't mean to get us stuck
out in the middle of nowhere...

1280
01:22:24,520 --> 01:22:26,476
...without our daddy. Sorry.

1281
01:22:26,840 --> 01:22:29,479
How's Santa gonna find us here?

1282
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:34,559
Don't worry, he has special radar.

1283
01:22:42,520 --> 01:22:45,751
- Merry Christmas, Mom.
- Merry Christmas, Mom.

1284
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:47,958
Merry Christmas.

1285
01:22:59,960 --> 01:23:02,428
- He was big and he jumped me.
- We'll find him.

1286
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:06,157
Wait, wait. I think
I'm picking up on something here.

1287
01:23:07,200 --> 01:23:09,031
Fresh meat, fresh meat, fresh meat.

1288
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:17,952
Yeah, that's the guy.

1289
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:19,435
Damn.

1290
01:23:19,640 --> 01:23:20,993
- He bit me.
- He ain't so big.

1291
01:23:21,200 --> 01:23:22,189
He had friends.

1292
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:24,277
The fur's gonna fly.

1293
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:26,391
Run! I'll take care of these guys.

1294
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:28,677
You take care of nobody, chump.

1295
01:23:30,520 --> 01:23:31,509
It's showtime.

1296
01:23:31,720 --> 01:23:33,233
- Your funeral.
- Your mama.

1297
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:35,189
Kill!

1298
01:23:52,160 --> 01:23:54,276
Honey, let's go to bed now.

1299
01:23:54,520 --> 01:23:57,557
- I'm not sleepy.
- I know.

1300
01:23:57,800 --> 01:23:59,199
But you know what?

1301
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:03,353
The sooner we go to sleep,
the sooner Christmas will come.

1302
01:24:21,720 --> 01:24:23,153
Santa?

1303
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:40,155
Mom.

1304
01:24:40,760 --> 01:24:42,955
Come over here. Look.

1305
01:24:43,240 --> 01:24:45,151
I think it's Santa.

1306
01:24:55,760 --> 01:24:56,795
Hello?

1307
01:25:01,400 --> 01:25:02,389
Man.

1308
01:25:02,760 --> 01:25:04,876
Merry Christmas, honey.

1309
01:25:14,200 --> 01:25:15,758
Daddy!

1310
01:25:16,040 --> 01:25:18,110
- Daddy!
- Hi, Julie.

1311
01:25:26,040 --> 01:25:27,553
Where's Rocks?

1312
01:25:27,800 --> 01:25:31,349
You wouldn't believe it.
We ran into these wolves, right?

1313
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:33,511
We actually got attacked by wolves.

1314
01:25:33,720 --> 01:25:36,757
- Oh, no.
- And Rocks came to my defence.

1315
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:40,549
And one of the wolves chomped
on my beeper. Look at it.

1316
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:44,959
And they all totally spazzed out.
Bunch of wimps.

1317
01:25:47,080 --> 01:25:49,355
Hey, kid, it's great to see you.

1318
01:25:50,640 --> 01:25:52,870
Oh, Rocks! How did you find us?

1319
01:25:53,080 --> 01:25:55,150
I just followed your scent.

1320
01:25:55,880 --> 01:25:58,519
And you smell beautiful, Daphne.
Oh, honey pie!

1321
01:25:58,720 --> 01:26:01,678
- Pumpkin butt.
- Not in front of the kids.

1322
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:05,754
And, James, before the wolves...

1323
01:26:06,240 --> 01:26:07,309
...what were you doing?

1324
01:26:08,440 --> 01:26:09,953
Getting fired.

1325
01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:13,993
Thank God!

1326
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:17,831
Mom, can Rocks stay with us now?

1327
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,150
Honey, have a heart.

1328
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:23,828
If not for Rocks,
we wouldn't be here together.

1329
01:26:24,160 --> 01:26:27,072
- I mean, I might even be dead.
- I know! That's why...

1330
01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:29,953
So, what if he's not
the smartest dog in the world?

1331
01:26:30,200 --> 01:26:32,191
Who cares if he can sit down?

1332
01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:33,389
I can sit down.

1333
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:36,831
- Or if he can beg.
- Beg? Beg's easy. Look.

1334
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:40,396
Who needs a beggar in the family?
Or lie down?

1335
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:43,473
I mean, the point is,
he is still a great dog.

1336
01:26:44,040 --> 01:26:45,189
He stays.

1337
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:46,350
- What?
- He stays.

1338
01:26:46,600 --> 01:26:47,794
Really?

1339
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:49,718
Hey, Mike, did you hear that?

1340
01:26:51,240 --> 01:26:52,593
I'm gonna stay!

1341
01:26:52,840 --> 01:26:54,159
Hey, guys?

1342
01:26:55,240 --> 01:26:57,356
I'm picking up
something weird over here.

1343
01:27:05,200 --> 01:27:07,760
Hey, what is that? Come here.

1344
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:10,996
Is that sleigh bells?

1345
01:27:12,920 --> 01:27:16,230
Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!

1346
01:27:18,200 --> 01:27:20,475
- I told you he was real.
- I knew that.

1347
01:27:20,720 --> 01:27:22,153
- You did not.
- I always knew.

1348
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:23,992
- You did not.
- Did too.

1349
01:27:24,440 --> 01:27:27,113
- She kissed you!
- I hate my sister.

1350
01:27:27,320 --> 01:27:29,390
- Get the cootie spray!
- Let's go to bed.

1351
01:27:29,640 --> 01:27:32,598
- I don't want to go to bed.
- This is so exciting!

1352
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:36,952
Santa's right outside. He's right
above our head. Can't you hear it?

1353
01:27:37,952 --> 01:27:47,952
