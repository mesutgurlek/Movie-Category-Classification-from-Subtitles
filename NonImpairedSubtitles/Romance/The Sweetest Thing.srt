vishnubond(podnapisi)

2
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,560
Christina Walters?

3
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,840
God, I haven't heard that name in ages.

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,520
The kind of womanwho can get any guy she wants,

5
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,560
That's Christina Walters.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,160
We dated briefly,but she's not the commitment type.

7
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,680
She's a player. She just likes to have fun.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,880
I met Christina at a bar. Hot piece of ass.

9
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:50,720
Totally hit it off. All night long we dance.I buy her drinks.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
At the end of the night, she just splits.

11
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,040
I lay down all that groundwork for nothing.

12
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,200
She gave me her number. It's been three days.

13
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,640
I saw Swingeer. I know how these things work.

14
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,240
Hello, and welcome to AOL Moviefone,

15
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,600
I stay up nights trying to figure outwhy she said she'd call and didn't.

16
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,280
Maybe she wanted to call and that's whyshe said she was going to call, but...

17
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,240
"Christina"

18
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:18,300
"Christina"

19
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:22,560
Prolonged impotence is very commonafter a breakup.

20
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,480
Lots of men suffer from it.

21
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,080
They just don't talk about it.Not like me, gabbing away. Gab, gab.

22
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:32,360
But, even still,because she said she was going to call...

23
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,600
...she should've calledto say she wasn't going to call...

24
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,990
...and I would've thanked her for calling...

25
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,500
All right. Okay .

26
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,630
At least I don't get that dizzy,head-spinning nausea as much as I used to.

27
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,000
Hooray!

28
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,600
Like I said, I'm doing fine.

29
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,230
I am fan-fucking-tastic.

30
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,360
- Christina.- Valerie!

31
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,240
Shake it if you've got it.

32
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,040
Miss Courtney.

33
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,360
Hello, Miss Christina.How you doing? What you doing?

34
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,520
Dancing too much. How you doing?

35
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,240
Same thing. How was your day?

36
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,640
Pretty good.

37
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,270
I got a new account designinga campaign for a sports line.

38
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,710
They got the right girl, didn't they?

39
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,680
Thank you.

40
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,400
So, what's up?

41
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,520
The usual. Defending the rightsof my broken-hearted clients.

42
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:54,440
Trying to squeeze every pennyout of their miserable, cheating spouses.

43
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,920
You go get them, woman,

44
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,560
I'll order a pizza and stay in tonight.

45
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,760
Okay, but if we do that,you know what will have to happen.

46
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,720
Girl, I've been shaking my assall the way up this hill.

47
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,070
Which track?

48
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,960
Track three. Oh, yeah!

49
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,720
Koochie!

50
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,440
Is your granny here? What's going on?

51
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,990
It's Jane. She loves this song.

52
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,360
Jane, what's up?

53
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,120
He dumped me.

54
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,400
Kevin dumped me.

55
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,350
It was just three daysbefore our one-year anniversary.

56
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,680
- Baby.- Maybe he just freaked out.

57
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,760
He will call up tomorrow when he realizeswhat a huge mistake he made.

58
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,310
- He's probably going through that whole...- No.

59
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,160
He says he's been wanting this for six months.

60
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:05,240
He says he's been dying insideever since I brought over my garment bag.

61
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,200
- Honey.- What?

62
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:13,400
We're all guilty of it.You made yourself too available.

63
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,880
It's a classic mistake, sweetheart.

64
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,560
- Yeah.- Not according to this.

65
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,760
"Commandment four."

66
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,720
"True Love: The Ten Commandments."

67
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,840
"Commandment number four:Thou shalt be open to love's possibilities.

68
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,240
"Boundaries are the enemies of love."

69
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:34,720
Sweetie, you know what?This book is relationship propaganda.

70
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,280
Listen to me.

71
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:40,310
Dating is all about boundaries.

72
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,320
Honey, you have to protect yourself.

73
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,560
We've all had our heart stomped onone too many times...

74
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,720
...because we served it to themon a big old platter.

75
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,920
A good defence is the best offence.

76
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I am so tired of playing games.

77
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,550
This is not about playing games.This is about self-preservation.

78
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:01,560
You can't throw yourself out thereall exposed and vulnerable every time.

79
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,360
That is how you get smacked down.

80
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,960
Do you understand?

81
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:09,440
Don't go looking for Mr. Right.Look for Mr. Right Now.

82
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,680
And, eventually, if he's worthy, then one day...

83
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,280
...that "now" part is just going to drop away.

84
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,920
Naturally, you know?

85
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,800
Meanwhile, you're justgoing to have fun together.

86
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,400
Yeah. Not so serious. Shake it off a little bit.

87
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:29,520
Speaking of fun, we are going to take you out.

88
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,480
We are taking you out.You are going to have a good time.

89
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,840
No.

90
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,520
Oswaldo!

91
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,760
Hey, Christina. Courtney.

92
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,000
- Jane.- Hello, Jane.

93
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,080
- Welcome.- Thank you.

94
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,320
Shut up!

95
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,800
- Right here, baby.- Oh, my God.

96
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,600
They can have her.

97
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:34,600
Look at the shoulder, baby.Bounce it, baby. Check it out, baby.

98
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,600
What's your name, baby?

99
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,360
Herewe go. Circle of love, circle of love!

100
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,520
We're going to go now.

101
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,720
Bye-bye.

102
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:09,120
My God. It's like Siegfried & Roy or something.

103
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,120
Martinis, ladies.

104
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,230
- Compliments of the gentleman at the bar.- Which one?

105
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,600
Thank you, Leather Coat Guy.

106
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,920
Cheers.

107
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,470
Leather Coat Guy is looking good.

108
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,000
Shotgun!

109
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,960
Cheater.

110
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,960
What's up?

111
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,200
Nothing. What's up with you?

112
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,200
Nothing.

113
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,000
What's up with you?

114
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,710
Nothing. What's up with you?

115
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,670
Nothing.

116
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,880
You know, I am having the best time.

117
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,200
Are you, sweetie?

118
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,790
My boyfriend dumped me. I'm at this clubwhere no one wants to talk to me.

119
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:00,190
- I want to go home.- No.

120
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,800
No. Christina, I can't do this.

121
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,310
Yes, you can. It's really very easy.

122
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,320
Observe.

123
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,000
I just pinched his ass.

124
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,310
I'm sorry. Hi.

125
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,040
- Hi. What's your name?- Peter.

126
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,280
Peter, this is my friend, Jane.Jane would love to dance.

127
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:25,680
I don't mean to be rude,but I have some friends waiting for me.

128
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,480
Nice to meet you, though.

129
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:32,120
- He hated me. I suck.- You don't suck. That guy was a dick.

130
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:35,960
I'll make sure that you have fun tonightif it's the last thing...

131
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,880
What did you call me?

132
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:44,350
You just called me a dick. I heard you.Why am I a dick?

133
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,440
Because I didn't like the wayyou treated my friend.

134
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,670
I didn't do anything to your friend.

135
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,230
You barely gave her the time of day.

136
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,800
You tried to pawn me off on her and I didn't go for it.

137
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,160
You should be so lucky to even talk to someone as hot and sweet as Jane.

138
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,230
Excuse me.

139
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:05,560
I wasn't suggesting you get married.I just thought you could get it on.

140
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,600
What? Get it on?

141
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,720
You know nothing about me.What if I'm some psycho serial killer?

142
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,880
What if Jane was the girl of your dreams,but you'll never know?

143
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,600
That is the sweetest thing.

144
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,720
I never thought I'd meet herby having somebody grab me and say:

145
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:23,040
"Man, I have good woman for you.She is very hot and sweet.

146
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,480
"Jane! Dance for the man!"

147
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,600
- Maybe that's your problem.- What?

148
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,760
Maybe if you didn't play it so safe,Mr. Safety-Poo...

149
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:33,760
...you might meet a girl you could have fun with.

150
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,800
This brilliant love advice comesfrom one who loves to play games with men.

151
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:41,240
Always in control.That way, she never has to get too close.

152
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,680
Nice manners, by the way.

153
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,600
Where the hell did that guy... Jane?

154
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,880
What's up with you?

155
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,120
Nothing. What's up with you?

156
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,560
I can't believe you grabbed his ass.

157
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:05,160
He comes right into my faceand starts telling me all this stupid stuff...

158
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:09,520
...about how I like to play gamesand be in control so I never get too close.

159
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,680
Can you believe him?

160
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,720
- What?- Nothing.

161
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,390
- I've never seen you act like this before.- Act like what?

162
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,600
They're fake.

163

- Bah-jiggity?- Yeah.

165
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,830
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to stare.

166
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,240
It's cool. It's why I got them.

167
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:27,350
- I'm not bah-jiggity.- You are so bah-jiggity.

168
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,360
They look real.

00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,440
Thank you. You can touch it if you want to.

170
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,510
No.

00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,320
- Touch it. She likes it.- Go ahead. It feels real, huh?

172
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:38,430
If I'm bah-jiggity about this guy Peter,it's because you're telling me I am.

173
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,040
- Oh, my God.- What?

174
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,720
You've named the puppy.

175
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,720
- I did not.- You just called him Peter.

176
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,440
- I did?- You've got to feel these things.

177
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,280
I'm psychic and I knew his name was Peter.

178
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,880
- Knock your socks off.- So soft.

179

I am so getting a pair.

182
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:07,040
That's why chicksalways go to the bathroom together.

183
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,000
It's so obvious that you like this guy.Why are you being such a pussy about it?

184
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,310
Why are you making such a big deal out of it?

185
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:16,760
If you haven't noticed,there's plenty of guys out there.

186
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,560
See you later.

187
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,070

00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:41,360
- Eric!- Be right there.

191
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,840
You don't have to do this.

192
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,840
I know, but I want to. I spilled your drink.Can I buy you another one?

193
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,150
Okay.

194
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,640
I want to apologize.

195
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:55,400
I shouldn't have been impolite to your friend.If I was, I didn't mean to.

196
00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:00,000
My brother is waiting for meand I got nervous, I guess. I don't know.

197
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,960
I mean, otherwise, I'd be all over your friend.

198
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,280
I'm the one who should apologize. I was rude.

199
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:11,720
No, I understand. You were protectingyour friend. Anyone would've done that.

200
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,480
I thought that was sweet.

201
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,360
Jesus.

202
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,240

209
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:46,040
Can you take this? I'm a total loser.I just struck out with this guy.

210
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,320
One more thing.

211
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:51,720
Should I be upset that my ex-girlfriendhas her tongue down that guy's throat?

212
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,480
Oh, my God!

213
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,430
- Jane!- I guess I blew my chance.

214
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,950
- That could have been you.- If I wasn't such a dick.

215
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:04,510
- Was I really a dick?- Yeah. You were a dick.

216
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,960
We should start over. Why don't I walk by,and you grab me like before?

217
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,880
- I didn't grab you.- You grabbed me.

218
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,920
You grabbed me right on the ass.

219
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,600

220
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,670

224

Did I mention that we have the Freddie Mercury Suite?

225
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,520
She puked on him!

226
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,640
Again? God, she's like a hose.Go help her, please.

227
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,960
Or not.

228
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:42,200
She's out. We're one short. Who's this chick?

229
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,880
- She is hot. Bring her.- What?

230
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:48,480

You've got to come. Let me tell you why.

232

You'll never find anyone better than my brother.He is the greatest...

233
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,040
That hurts me. Just look at him.

234
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,760

I'll ask my friends. Maybe we'll stop by.

- Of course, go ahead.- Thank you.

271
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:41,670
Don't worry about returning the favour.Men don't really like oral sex.

272
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,800
Right.

273
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,760
I'm serious. It's just a bad rumourthat was started sometime in the '50s.

274
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,920
I had no idea. I need to tell all my friends.

275
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:54,040
Please, do.Someone needs to put an end to this madness.

276
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:02,600
God, I'm so glad I came back to the hotel room.

282
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,840
You are good.

283

All right!

284
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,470
I said I wanted to do it to you every hour,on the hour, but I can't wait.

I am scared enough as it is to go in there.What am I going to say?

311

"Mr. Martin, can you help me with my jizz?"

312
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,000

00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:05,640
Just a dress, but I'll be back for itin a few days, so no hurry.

322
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:08,120
- Any stains?- No.

323
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,760
- What's this?- What?

324
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,880
This. Come here.

325
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,160
Stain?

326
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,470
This is going to be a tough one.

327
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:24,400
I didn't even notice that. I must have spilledsome soda on me last night.

328
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:28,800
No. This is not soda. Think, Jane. Think.

329
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:32,950
If I know what it is, it's easier for me to remove.

330
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:39,430
The field trip. Come in, children. Come in.

331
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,350
- Fuck.- Good afternoon, Mrs. Franklin.

332
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,000
Hi, Mr. Martin.

333
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:50,830
On today's field trip,we are going to learn about cleanliness.

334
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,800
Jane?

335
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,040
Jane Burns!

336
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:01,910
Sweetheart, I haven't seen yousince I taught you in third grade!

337
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:09,360
- Top of the morning there, Mr. Martin.- Hello, Father Flynn.

338
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:16,120
As I live and breathe, isn't it...It is little Mary Jane Burns!

339
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:20,310
What a coincidence!I'm having supper with your parents tonight.

340
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:23,280
What a stain you got there, little Janie!

341
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,280
So how was it? Was it fun?

342
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,480
Oh, my God, I can't believe I didn't tell you this.

343
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,640
Apparently, one of the guyswho was at the party flipped out...

344
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,240
...was out on the balcony,screaming at the top of his lungs:

345
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:41,640
"Christina! Has anyone seenmy little Christina?"

346
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:46,760
Then he jumps off and diesbecause you're a pussy. Why didn't you go?

347
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:51,000
I don't know! I was going to. I was.I was going to, and then I wasn't.

348
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,350
And then I called him at the hotel...

349
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,120
Wait. Hold on. Rewind for one second.You called him at the hotel?

350
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:02,760
- What did he say?- Nothing. He said nothing. Okay?

351
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,600
- Why?- He checked out already.

352
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:07,440
Let's just sum this up real quickly.

353
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,200
In the bathroom, we hate him,yet we call him by name.

354
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,600
Then we throw beer on him.

355
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:17,160
Then we laugh and we flirtand we dance with him.

356
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:21,920
Then we casually call him at the hotel.Then we obsess about the casual call.

357
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,240
Obsess? I'm not obsessing, okay?

358
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:30,160
Could all this erratic behaviourbe because this guy got under your skin?

359
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,080
- No.- That you might really like him?

360
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:35,950
That you regret not going becauseyou'll never know what might've happened?

361
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,800
No, I don't regret it, and if I had any regrets...

362
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,240
...it would be this conversation,right now, having it with you.

363
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,160
- Can we drop it?- Okay. Sorry I brought it up.

364
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,920
I won't mention it again.

365
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:53,280
Even if I did regret not going to the party...

366
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,760
...it's not like I can do anything about it now.

367
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,280
Sometimes you just haveto let these things go, right?

368
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,590
- Exactly.- Although...

369
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,080
...if there was regret...

370
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:09,030
...I suppose there's always somethingyou could do about it.

371
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:14,520
You could show up at his brother's wedding,because it is his brother.

372
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:17,440
But that's only if you regretted it,which I don't regret it.

373
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:21,310
I just don't regret it.Regret is such a waste of time.

374
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,800
Honey will you just admitthat you regret not going to this party.

375
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,160
- Okay, fine I regret not going to this party.- You need to let it go.

376
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,880
I'm letting it go. I'm over it.

377
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:34,040
Hi, honey, how did it go?

378
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,390
- Fine. No problem.- Good.

379
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,600
Did we have fun last night?

380
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,480
Yes, I did. It was great.

381
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:45,120
You guys were right,a transition guy is what I needed.

382
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,400
Good.

383
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,280
So how was he, was he good?

384
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:51,320
He was very sweet and complimentary.

385
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,720
And very into pleasing me first.

386
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:56,110
So how was girth?

387
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,360
Averag-ish.

388
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:01,910
"Averag-ish." That's good.So what did you tell him?

389
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,040
What do you mean?

390
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,920
What do we always tell them, no matter what?

391
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:15,600
Oh, my God, your penis is so big.

392
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,200
Good girl.

393
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:20,280
Your penis is so thick.

394
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,960
Your penis is just so pretty.

395
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:31,150
You got a handsome dick!

396
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,630
Your penis, it's so...

397
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,400
...hard.

398
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:41,030
Your penis is just so large.

399
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,360
My body is a movie...

400
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:48,680
...and your penis is the star!

401
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:54,760
You're too big to fit in here.

402
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,880
Too big to fit in here.

403
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,310
Too big to fit in here.

404

"You're too big to fit in here"

405
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:16,960
Oh, my God.

406
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:20,120
Oh, my God, it's Fame! We're in Fame right now.

407
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,800
"What a lovely ride

00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,760

- Come on.- How much time we got?

430
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:39,320
We've got three hours before the rehearsal.Hit the ball.

431
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,560
- Good shot.- Fore!

432
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,840
I'll shove that club up your ass, you dicklicker!

433
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,710
- What are you up by, two?- I guess.

434
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,800
It doesn't get any better than this.

435
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,400
- To the marriage.- To the marriage.

436
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:56,240
- To the bride.- To the bride.

437
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,240
To 50 years with the same woman.

438
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,880
That's really depressing.

439
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,750
Sorry.

440
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,080
Saggy tits.

441
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,150
Be able to use them as a belt by then.

442
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,270
- Or just tuck them in her socks.- Okay.

443
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:19,950
God, this marriage is such a big leap.It's really intense, Pete.

444
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:23,360
- But if it's the right  woman...- I guess.

445
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,910
Get up a little. Yes. Fore!

446
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:31,880
You motherfuckers! Stop bothering me!

447
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,920
You're driving right into them.

448
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:37,040
I hear John is still AWOLfrom that bachelor party.

449
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:41,400
He showed up, missing an eyebrow,with a tattoo on his ass that says "Bitch."

450
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:45,600
- I am not an animal!- Very good.

451
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,240
Speaking of bitches...

452
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,840
...what was going on with youat the club with that hottle?

453
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,560
- Nothing.- I mean, Jesus!

454
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,920
I don't know what you're talking about.

455
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,230
- I think you liked her.- No, I didn't.

456
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,680
Yeah, you did. Don't lie to me.

457
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:05,230
Don't lie. Don't lie to Darth, Luke.

458
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:12,830
I could see it in your eyes you liked her.

459
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,520
Nothing I can do about it now.

460
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,390
Should have poked her in the whiskerswhen you had the chance.

461
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,160
What's that, Gramps?

462
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,150
I met this hot young dish...

463
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,840
...at the World's Fair back in 1940.

464
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:34,240
Every moment with her was like a slice of heaven.

465
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,710
I bet you really miss Grandma.

466
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,440
Fuck Grandma.

467
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,400
It's Pearl I'm talking about.

468
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:47,960
She was the love of my life.Don't ever let these moments pass you by.

469
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,120
Fucking Grandma.

470
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,270
Be nice.

471
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,520
Come on. 7-6.

472
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,680
Fore!

473
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,880
You suck!

474
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,510
Damn it!

475
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,560
- But you smell so minty fresh now.- What do you want?

476
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:33,630
I need to borrow your black Gucci bag.

477
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,520
It's in the living room.

478
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:40,230
I don't know where in the living room,and I don't feel like looking for it.

479
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:43,440
Will you help me find it, please?Come on, please.

480
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:46,560
Since I'm up now,and you decided to torture me...

481
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,320
...I'll go and get it.

482
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,230
I'm sorry. Oh, my God. Excuse me.

483
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:55,600
Can you tell me where the bathroom is?

484
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,040
- Behind you.- Over here?

485
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,680
Thanks.

486
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,280
Oh, my...

487
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,960
...cock.

488
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,680
Oh, my cock.

489
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,520
Do you have any Advil?

490
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:25,760
He is so cute. So stupid.

491
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,350
Can I get that purse now, please?

492
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,640
Yes, you can have the purse.

493
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,920
Here's the purse.

494
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,960
Thank you very much.

495
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:44,880
- Where are you going?- You and I are going to a wedding.

496
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:49,480
- What wedding? Who's getting married?- We're going to Peter's brother's wedding.

497
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,600
Peter?

498
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:53,990
This Somerset place where they liveis some small freak-ass town...

499
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:58,120
...three hours north, so we have toget on the road now to make it on time.

500
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,960
- Peter.- What?

501
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,400
I'm not going to Peter's brother's wedding!

502
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:08,190
What are you talking about? Yesterday,you said you wanted to go, so I went...

503
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,720
- I was joking.- No, you weren't.

504
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,030
Yes, I was.

505
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:18,320
Fifty percent of what people saywhen they're joking is true.

506
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:22,240
Which means you do want to go,but you're too afraid to admit it.

507
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:26,120
So by making some sort of joke about it,you get to say what you really want...

508
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,000
...without being vulnerable.

509
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,800
- Right?- Maybe.

510
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:33,720
Okay. The wedding starts at 5:00.I refuse to be late.

511
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,390
Put some clothes on. Now! Thank you.

512
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,600
- That was a nice one.- Thanks.

513
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,840
- Watch the road, sweetie!- I am watching the road.

514
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,720
Once we get off the 140...

515
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:02,510
...we'll take the 95, get off on the Somerset exit.

516
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,040
We'll drive aroundand we should find the church, no problem.

517
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,110
Ta-da!

518
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:14,070
- What is that?- What is what?

519
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:17,670
- You don't smell that?- What? I don't smell anything.

520
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:21,080
- You're used to it. That's what's scary.- I don't smell anything.

521
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:24,470
It smells like mouldy ass,is what it smells like in here.

522
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,840
Come to think of it,I did leave some ass in the back.

523
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,880
- You did?- About a week ago.

524
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:33,720
It must be the ass. No, no. Sit down.

525
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:42,040
- What are you doing?- Jesus, Courtney.

526
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:44,720
What is all this crap?

527
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,800
Don't throw out anything I might need.

528
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:52,120
Where is it coming from? Where?I can still smell it.

529
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:56,160
Maybe it's you.Did something crawl up your poon-nonny?

530
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:01,880
I have never, ever had any complaintsin the poon-nonny odour department.

531
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:05,720
- You know what? Neither have I.- High five on the clean poon-nonny.

532
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,270
Bitch.

533
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,360
What?

534
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,520
- What is this?- What is what?

535
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,800
What is this?

536
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:16,800
Jesus, I don't know.I don't know how long it's been in here.

537
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,440
What is in here?

538
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:26,480
No! That is not okay.

539
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:30,190
It isn't okay. You are a disgusting,nasty pig. Do you understand?

540
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,510
There was maggots on that flesh.

541
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,990
I got maggot juice all over me.

542
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,280
Ladies' room.

543
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,280
Ladies' room.

544
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,440
- Someone's in here.- Sorry.

545
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,950
- It might be a while.- How long?

546
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,840
Let me put it to you this way:

547
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:58,200
I had lamb curry last nightand I'm shittlng out a Buick.

548
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,360
Was it absolutely vitalfor her to tell us that?

549
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,190
Was it absolutely vitalfor her to tell us that?

550
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,550
Hello?

551
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,960
Clear?

552
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,160
I feel like I have maggots all over me.

553
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:21,400
Don't move. You have a maggot right here.

554
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,280
Stop it.

555
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:27,040
I'm going to pee my pants.

556
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,280
I'll just use the urinal.

557
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:33,040
You want to hear some poetry?

558
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:36,360
"There once was a man from BandooWho fell asleep in a canoe"

559
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:39,200
"He dreamed of VenusAnd played with his penis"

560
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:41,880
"And woke up with a handful of goo"

561
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,640
Don't make me laugh!

562
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,320
Darn it. I think I peed on myself.

563
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,270
"Follow the yellow brick road"?

564
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:56,720
I'm following the yellow brick road.Follow the yellow brick road.

565
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:04,320
Buffy! You look like my old doggie Buffy.Hello, girl.

566
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:10,080
- Oh, my God, it's on my hands!- Good girl. What you got in here?

567
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,670
What you got? What's in your mouth?

568
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,360
What you got in there?

569
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,200
What's in there?

570
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,040
Surprise!

571
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,280
Goddamn it.

572
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:37,720
How could you not knowwhat a glory hole is?

573
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:40,030
Unlike my whore friendCourtney Rockliffe...

574
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:43,960
...I don't usually spend much timein men's public bathrooms.

575
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:48,400
Goddamn. That is the funniest thingI have ever seen in my entire life.

576
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:53,720
I flew across that room.And you got fucked in the eye.

577
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:57,800
I'm glad you find it so fucking amusing.I really do.

578
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:01,760
Could you please have some compassion?Because I could go blind.

579
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,840
You're not going to go blind.

580
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:08,350
- Let me look at it.- I mean, I got a penis in my eye.

581
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,640
Let me see. Let me see.

582
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,480
All right.

583
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,560
- Is it okay?- Yeah, it's okay.

584
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,040
But I think you're pregnant.

585
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:23,080
Would you please stop it, already?

586
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:28,680
Re-dress the mannequinsand check the sock inventory.

587
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:31,920
Come on, it's Saturday and nobody's here,and Mr. Mooney...

588
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,080
Mr. Mooney is off salling with his boytoy,which leaves me in charge of the store.

589
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,080
Somebody needs to get some.

590
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,720
There's my dirty girl!

591
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:55,640
It's me, baby. It's me.

592
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:01,600
- Why are you dressed like that?- It's my job. I work at a children's hospital.

593
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,840
You look so cute.

594
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,760
- I'm horny.- Me, too.

595
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,400
- You'll laugh at this one.- What?

596
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:24,320
You know I sald I had to do laundry today,because I ran out of clean underwear?

597
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:28,240
- I've only got the skanky ones left.- Tell me about it, dude.

598
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,640
You are so unbelievable.

599
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:38,560
Is that what I think it is?

600
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:42,920
- Spring break, 1994, baby.- Turn it up.

601
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:17,560
- Oh, my God! Brain.- Jane!

602
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:20,790
You and I are so awesome together.

603
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,880
We're like two peas in a pod.

604
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,110
- Like oil and vinegar...- Shut up.

605
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:27,870
I can't believe I'm fuckinga purple elephant.

606
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:31,990
What do you mean, she's not here?We have customers, missy.

607
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:34,720
Sorry, Mr. Mooney. I'll check upstairs.

608
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,760
I'm gone for one day,the place turns into Indonesia.

609
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:42,110
Jane?

610
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,830
- Are you okay?- I'm fine.

611
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,680
- What is going on?- Nothing.

612
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:55,440
I'm frantic. I've a million things to do.And I'm dizzy. I'm so dizzy.

613
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:58,920
Mr. Mooney is downstalrs,and he is P-I-S-E-D.

614
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,030
"Pised"?

615
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,160
- Where have you been?- I was upstalrs taking inventory.

616
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,750
Yeah, my aunt Fanny.

617
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:20,480
- Gallini's.-Hello, is Jane there?

618
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,720
- Yes, she is.-Have a lovely day,

619
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:28,080
- Hello?-Janie!

620
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:32,960
Sorry, I can't talk right now.I'm really busy.

621
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,440
We were wondering:

622
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:41,950
Shit.

623
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:02,040
Oh, shit.

624
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:05,800
I dropped the thingy to my lip gloss.Could you get it for me?

625
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,360
I'll get it.

626
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:12,190
It's too far over. I'll get it.

627
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:15,080
Hold on to it. Keep steering.

628
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:16,800
I got it. Don't worry.

629
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,040
Beneath the...

630
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,750
Yeah, baby!

631
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:41,880
- Oh, yeah, right there.- No, that's not it.

632
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,680
You like that?

633
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:49,040
Yeah. Let me have some of that.

634
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:51,800
- Oh, yeah. Don't stop.- I'm not going to stop.

635
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:21,600
I found it.I almost got smothered down there.

636
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:22,950

"Freaky."

644
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:20,000

- Welcome to my store. Can I help you?- No, we were just browsing. Thank you.

648

You don't like my store, do you?

649
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:45,480
No, that's not it at all.It's really a lovely store.

650
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:47,950
We were looking for something...

651
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:52,070
The next dress store is 20 miles from here.

652
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:53,360
20 miles away?

653
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:57,760
- We'll miss the wedding.- Judy Webb's wedding?

654
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:01,080
I know all about it.I dressed half the guests!

655
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:03,920
When I was 22...

Nice and perky.

658
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:12,800
Gravity has taken them to there.

659
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:15,910
It's like, 22, 28.

O>kay, wait. No, no. Look. What is this?

663
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:33,070

664
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:37,560

674

My God!

685

Oh, my God.

686
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:45,040
These are the days of our lives.

687
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:50,280
- This is not discreet.- No, it isn't.

688
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:54,240
- We can't walk into a wedding...- Come on. It's very LaToya Jackson.

689
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:58,800
I mean, really. Look at all this...

690
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:02,350
I may as well strap a sign on my assthat says "stalker."

691
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:07,840
I'm not going there wearing this outfit.Can we please just go?

692
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:10,200
- Yes. Let's go home.- Really?

693
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:15,520

00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:23,440
I'm not reverse psychologing you.

697
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:26,880
You're so good at it,you don't know you're doing it anymore.

698
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:29,320
All right, maybe a little bit.

699
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:33,520
- Court, this is crazy. Really crazy.- What the hell were we thinking?

700
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,470
I wish there were some sign from God...

701
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:39,240
...that you and Peter Donahueshould be together.

702
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:42,320
How do you know his last name is Donahue?

703
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:44,560
Because you're sitting on his face.

704
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:50,600
- My God, it's him! He's so cute!- Yeah, I know.

705

Cute? He's adorable!

706

And look at this."Everything he touches turns to sold."

00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:59,110
- He's funny! He's funny, too. See?- I know.

708

Church bells.

709
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:29,590
What do you think? Bride or groom's side?

710
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:31,830
I have to go to the bathroom, I think.

00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:36,400
- Did you misplace your bladder today?- I'm wearing the tightest skirt ever.

712
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:38,710
Go to the bathroom. I'll find seats.

713
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:42,830
- Could you tell me where the restroom is?- It's right outside.

714

716
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:05,630
Really? Okay.Just breathe, stay calm, you'll be okay.

717
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:07,480
Are you okay?

00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:10,960
- You'll be fine. You'll be okay.- Water!

719
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:14,470

- Thank you.- I'll leave you alone for a second, okay?

721
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:22,560
- Judy!- In a minute, Dad.

722
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:31,920
I don't want to go in the deep end.I don't want to go in the deep end!

723
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:35,440
Flowers!

No, you don't. You look really beautiful.Like the perfect bride.

726
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:46,200
Why don't I feel good?

727
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:50,760
I'm sure that you're just really nervous.It's a big day, right?

728
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,230
It's what every girl dreams of, but...

729
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:56,360
...how do you know it's real?

730
00:50:57,120 --> 00:51:00,670
I don't know.I can't answer that for you, really.

731
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:04,080
But I'm sure the two of youwill be really happy together.

732
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:08,560
And if you're not,you can always just get divorced.

733
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:12,200
- Yeah!- Yeah, see? It'll be okay.

734

We don't have to lie anymorebecause I made friends with the bride.

758
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:35,960
No. You cannot lock the door.Goddamn it!

801
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:15,070
Anymore!

802
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:17,640
- You're ruining it.- But...

803
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:19,200
We're still friends.

804
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:25,000
- I don'twant to get married.- I don'twant to get married.

805
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:29,310
No. No kiss. I haven't married you yet.

806
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:32,280
We're not getting married!

807
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:36,110
Miguel?

808
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,070
Dad!

809
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:43,760
Butwe are having the party.Exit in the back. It's to the left.

810
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:11,950
- How you doing?- Okay. Are you okay?

811
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:13,680
Yeah, no. I'm okay.

812
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:16,720
- You ower me $30,000 for this wedding.- Daddy, please.

813
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:20,000
- You know what I'm thinking of doing?- What's that?

814
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:24,680
I'll cash in the honeymoon tickets,fly to Bali, and go scuba diving.

815
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:27,880
- I'll rip your face off, peckerhead.- Daddy, stop.

816
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:30,120
- Sweetie?- Yes?

817
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:33,960
- I have a confession to make.- I have a confession to make. You're dead.

818
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:37,240
Dad. I met someone.

819
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:39,590
- You met someone.- Online.

820
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:40,910
Online.

821
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:47,320
His name is Ricky.I think he's really special.

822
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:50,600
Fuck it! It's go time! Son of a bitch!

823
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:52,680
Daddy, stop it!

824
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:10,510
Refresh my memory.Was that Peter's wedding we walked in on?

825
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:15,960
- Yeah.- That's what I thought.

826
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:20,960
I'm such an idiot.

827
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:23,750
No, you're not.

828
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:26,790
I meet a guy for two minutes...

829
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:31,200
...and I'm chasing after himlike he's something special.

830
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:36,320
Maybe you want someone special for once.

831
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:41,920
Maybe you were thinkingthat you were tired of the game.

832
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:48,520
Are you tired of the game?

833
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:51,840
Yep.

834
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:56,040
Let's go home.

835
00:58:57,080 --> 00:58:58,070
Okay.

836
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:17,000
My God! What's going on?

837
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:18,920
Excuse me, Officer?

838
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:20,920
What's going on here?

839
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:24,880
Twenty years on the forceand I've never seen something so horrible.

840
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:27,950
- What? Where?- Where's the emergency?

841
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:29,360
Apartment three.

842
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:31,880
- That's my apartment!- Jane.

843
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:36,200
Poor girl. Never saw it coming.

844
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:39,080
Excuse me.

845
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:43,040
- Goddamn dress!- Don't go in. It's not a pretty sight.

846
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:44,560
I live here!

847
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:56,680
- Apparently, they're stuck.- What do you mean?

848
00:59:57,720 --> 00:59:59,120
Are you okay?

849
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:02,800
How are you stuck?

850
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:04,440
I have a piercing.

851
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:08,760
- I don't get it. How is she stuck?- Behind her tonsils.

852
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:11,200
How the hell do you know that?

853
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:14,830
- Honey, I'm going to pull you gently.- No.

854
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:17,760
I'm going to pull it. Gently.

855
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:21,440
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

856
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:25,920
We've got the ambulance waiting outside.We have to get going.

857
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,520
No, wait!

858
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:31,230
She could sing. You could sing, Jane.It relaxes the throat, honey.

859
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:41,920
Stop it! You're getting me hard again!

860
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:44,080
Wrong song.

861
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:46,240
Armageddon.

862
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:04,520
Come on, try.

863
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:07,520
What?

864
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:15,720
She says to him,"Girl You Know It's True changed my life."

865
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:17,200
It did!

866
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:19,560
And this sad little tear slowly...

867
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:23,640
Come on. What do you want from me?I was 16 years old.

868
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:27,600
I don't know why I started talking to herin the sccond grade.

869
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:30,760
- You thought I was the shit.- You are the shit.

870
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:32,240
Shithead.

871
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:34,710
- My God.- What?

872
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:38,990
They found a donor for my patient.I've got to go. I'm sorry, guys.

873
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:42,280
- Christina, it was great meeting you.- Nice to meet you, Greg.

874
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:45,000
- Jane, it was great meeting you.- Great meeting you.

875
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:47,760
So sorry to run off.I'll make you risotto tomorrow.

876
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:48,960
It's fine.

877
01:02:53,080 --> 01:02:56,280
- Can I just say, that was so sweet?- He's great.

878
01:02:56,560 --> 01:02:58,560
- He's so sweet.- Shut up.

879
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:00,990
He doesn't have any piercings, does he?

880
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:04,440
I don't know, actually...

881
01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:09,190
...because I haven'tdone that with him yet.

882
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:13,160
- So, you know...- Honey, you really do like him.

883
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:16,200
I don'twant to talk about it,because I'll jinx it.

884
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:15,760
- I closed on the Mahalock house today.- Great news for you.

885
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:17,720
You don't need to do a thing.

886
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:21,440
- What did they say about aluminium siding?- No.

887
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:24,360
- Really?- Really.

888
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:27,830
Be careful with those fat-free chips.They cause anal leakage.

889
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:31,120
- You cause anal leakage.- Says so on the bag.

890
01:04:40,840 --> 01:04:45,360
What kind of marketing brainiacputs "anal leakage" on his product?

891
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:48,950
How can they even sell that crap?

892
01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:51,240
- What time is your flight?- 9:30.

893
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:55,320
I can't believe you're going to Costa Rica.

894
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:57,840
Your female problems are over with.

895
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:00,200
- Hope so.- They are.

896
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:02,840
You know what I hearabout Costa Rican women?

897
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,600
- For five pesos...- No, Rog.

898
01:05:04,680 --> 01:05:07,800
They take your chimichangaand your pequito...

899
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:09,800
- No, seor.- Listen to me!

900
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:11,030
Fuck you.

901
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:15,120
All I'm saying is,make nice with the concierge, okay?

902
01:05:17,240 --> 01:05:19,920
- You all right, Vera?- Couldn't be better.

903
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:25,670
- Thank you so much.- Where do you want it?

904
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:28,520
Put her down right here.

905
01:05:28,680 --> 01:05:32,120
Since you're going away,do you want to be on our malling list?

906
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:34,830
Yes, ma'am. I'd love to. Thank you.

907
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:39,800
I've been trying to get us offthat mailing list since 1982.

908
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:41,240
Relax.

909
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:45,840
This is the hottest chick in this storeand I caught her trying to escape.

910
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:08,960
Very strange.

911
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:18,230
Sweetie, Christina, what's going on?What happened?

912
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:23,600
I came to just eat my cookieand make a phone call, but...

913
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:26,880
You didn't want to eat the cookies? What?

914
01:06:27,240 --> 01:06:29,880
- Just read this.- All right.

915
01:06:31,040 --> 01:06:34,480
"Commandment number nine:Thou shalt love what's possible."

916
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:38,550
Honey, we have gone over this.

917
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:41,720
You did not knowthe guy was getting married.

918
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:44,160
It's all right. He wasn't possible.

919
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:47,840
Not that one. The next one.Commandment ten.

920
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:52,040
- "Thou shalt not fear"?- Yes. "Thou shalt not fear."

921
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:54,160
What are you talking about, fear?

922
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:56,880
What you did was an incredibly brave thing.

923
01:06:57,240 --> 01:07:01,280
You dropped all of your boundariesand you met this guy halfway.

924
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:03,950
More than halfway, you went to Somerset.

925
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:07,400
Guys, it was just another game. Come on.

926
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:11,880
If he hadn't been getting married,wasn't the groom, what would I've done?

927
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:14,830
That's right.

928
01:07:16,520 --> 01:07:20,760
I would've done the same old thing.I would have hesitated. I would have...

929
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:26,910
...froze up.I would have kissed him and then ran off.

930
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:30,840
Give him the wrong phone number.

931
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:35,280
Hook that fishand just throw him right back.

932
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:37,390
Jesus.

933
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:43,080
I'm stuck in a rut.

934
01:07:47,640 --> 01:07:50,640
Big, fat rut.

935
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:55,120
Guys, I don'twant to be that girl anymore.

936
01:07:56,640 --> 01:07:58,320
- I know.- You know?

937
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:00,550
I know. None of us do.

938
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:05,960
Let's go dancing.

939
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:11,760
So, any chance?

940
01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:15,590
Of what? No, don't even bother.She's on a mission.

941
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:29,480
- How is it shaking, ladies?- No, thank you.

942
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:32,400
Your body is banging. Your face is...

943
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:34,360
Neato. Thanks. Neat.

944
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:42,120
What's going on, hot mama?

945
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:49,080
Bringing it down. Bringing it up now!

946
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:55,640
Here it comes, baby. Feel the monkey.Work the monkey.

947
01:08:55,720 --> 01:08:58,520
The monkey, the monkey, the monkey!

948
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:06,800
- You'reworking that monkey.- You're a really good dancer.

949
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:10,800
- You have some original moves.- Thanks, I've been working on it.

950
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:14,080
- Have we met before?- A couple of times.

951
01:09:14,440 --> 01:09:15,480
I'm Donny.

952
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:21,680
Christina.

953
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:23,910
This is like Sixteen Candles.

954
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,040
I'd love to take you out sometime.

955
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:31,430
Really? Well, that's nice. I mean...

956
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:34,870
Give me your card, I'll call you sometime.

957
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:37,720
Thank you.

958
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:40,200
You seem like a really nice person.

959
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:43,800
- Work on the monkey.- I'll work on the monkey.

960
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:12,400
Hey, Donny.

961
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:15,270
- Do you have a pen?- You bet.

962
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:23,960
I'm a jerk and I wanted to apologize,because I didn't plan on calling you.

963
01:10:24,200 --> 01:10:27,320
I'll give you my numberso that you can call me...

964
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:32,640
...because I found out somethingthat was completey life-changing:

965
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:35,320
It's okay to take a chance.

966
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:39,280
Love is crazy and that's what love is,it's taking a chance.

967
01:10:40,160 --> 01:10:44,560
My girlfriend Courtney and Iwent on this crazy ride for a guy.

968
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:49,080
I went across the state, practically,to find this guy that I don't even know.

969
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:53,160
I don't even know you, but here I am,having this conversation with you.

970
01:10:53,240 --> 01:10:57,560
And I know that if I just take a chancewith you, maybe, I don't know...

971
01:10:57,720 --> 01:10:59,320
Forget it.

972
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:02,680
What's a guy got to do to get laid?

973
01:11:40,240 --> 01:11:41,960
- Chris?- Yeah?

974
01:11:42,040 --> 01:11:43,190
Honey?

975
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:46,870
What?

976
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:51,760
My God.

977
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:56,440
What am I going to do?

978
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,600
I think you can handle this oneon your own.

979
01:12:00,120 --> 01:12:01,800
It's all good, girl.

980
01:12:03,880 --> 01:12:06,800
Figure this one out. Figure it out. Okay.

981
01:12:12,680 --> 01:12:13,720
Christina?

982
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:17,160
What are you doing here?

983
01:12:17,480 --> 01:12:20,720
- I came here to apologize to you.- For what?

984
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:23,800
For not telling you I was getting married.

985
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:26,640
I should have told you that and I didn't.I'm sorry.

986
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:29,560
You're the guy that needs the last flingbefore your wedding.

987
01:12:29,640 --> 01:12:31,920
No. I'm not that guy.

988
01:12:32,480 --> 01:12:37,240
You spilled my drink and I let you buy mea beer. Tha twas all there was to it.

989
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:41,640
We had fun, we talked and that was it.

990
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:43,920
Right?

991
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:47,560
Yeah, I guess you're right.

992
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:50,320
I didn't get married.

993
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:59,080
- What do you mean?- Judy and I, we called it off.

994
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:06,800
I hope my... That thing that happeneddidn't have anything to do with it.

995
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:09,320
No, it had nothing to do with that.

996
01:13:09,400 --> 01:13:14,110
We realiezd we were doing the wrong thing.Two people should be in love.

997
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:18,320
But Judy is happy.She's scuba diving in Bali.

998
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:22,110
She really liked you, too.Why were you at my wedding?

999
01:13:23,960 --> 01:13:28,960
It was just one of those spontaneous thingsmy girlfriend and I do.

1000
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:31,350
It was just, really...

1001
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:34,440
It just got screwed up.

1002
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:41,960
I came here tonightbecause I wanted to see you.

1003
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:44,920
I thought that maybe...

1004
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:48,670
Well, that night that we met...

1005
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:53,600
...I thought there was something,some feeling I had about us.

1006
01:13:54,720 --> 01:13:59,240
I thought that maybe you mightfeel that way, too.

1007
01:13:59,320 --> 01:14:02,560
Is this a mutual thing?This is not a mutual thing at all.

1008
01:14:02,680 --> 01:14:04,960
This is a very stupid thing. I'm stupid.

1009
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:08,080
I should go.I really apologize for wasting your time.

1010
01:14:08,160 --> 01:14:11,200
And I'll go jump offthe Golden Gate Bridge now.

1011
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:15,030
Thanks. See you.I'm stupid. That's right.

1012
01:14:15,560 --> 01:14:18,920
That's exactly what I wanted to do.

1013
01:14:21,320 --> 01:14:23,470
Yes. Gosh, it's going so well.

1014
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:46,560
I'm not going to be afraid.

1015
01:14:53,080 --> 01:14:54,120
Peter?

1016
01:14:57,440 --> 01:15:00,160
Shit. Peter, wait!

1017
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:12,920
Shit.

1018
01:15:29,640 --> 01:15:30,630
Come on!

1019
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:34,200
Are you okay?

1020
01:15:34,840 --> 01:15:35,880
Yes.

1021
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:40,080
I don't think I handled that too...

1022
01:15:40,160 --> 01:15:43,760
I didn't handle it at all. I'm so sorry.

1023
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:47,200
I wanted to find youso that I could tell you...

1024
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:51,720
...that I did come to your weddingbecause I wanted to see you again...

1025
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:55,400
...because the feeling is mutual,and you better be a good kisser.

1026
01:16:09,160 --> 01:16:10,440
That was weak.

1027
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:12,670
- Weak?- Yeah.

1028
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:16,920
It's okay. You can try again.

1029
01:16:28,120 --> 01:16:30,270
You were so much better in my dream.

1030
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:32,160
Hold these.

1031
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:39,360
- I thought this was mutual.- Oh, my God.

1032
01:16:39,480 --> 01:16:42,320
I'm serious. I'll call you, okay?

1033
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:45,240
What? Wait!

1034
01:16:45,320 --> 01:16:47,630
Thanks for the flowers. Nice touch.

1035
01:16:47,720 --> 01:16:50,110
I'm out of practice! I just woke up!

1036
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:52,560
Unbelievable!

1037
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:02,240
Christina Walters. Yep. I know her.

1038
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:05,160
Bitch. Made my life a living hell.

1039
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:09,760
She tries to pawn me off on her friend.She calls me a dick.

1040
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:12,230
She hunts me down like a dogat my own wedding.

1041
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:15,040
Then, when I try to apologize, she's like:

1042
01:17:15,160 --> 01:17:19,200
"I don't know you. You're one of hundreds.I have no feelings for you..."

1043
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:27,120
Is that how I sound?

1044
01:17:34,240 --> 01:17:36,310
The movie is starting. Let's go!

1045
01:18:03,160 --> 01:18:04,310
Fuck Grandma.

1046
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:16,680
Save yourself a buck.

1047
01:18:21,240 --> 01:18:22,960
- A girl that you lick.- Really?

1048
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:25,000
- That you lick.- A girl that I lick?

1049
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:34,200
Are you all right?

1050
01:18:34,760 --> 01:18:36,600
You'rewatching the credits?

1051
01:18:54,160 --> 01:18:56,920
- Chicks freak on this guy.- You ower me thirty...

1052
01:19:06,360 --> 01:19:07,400
Copy that.

1053
01:19:14,200 --> 01:19:15,760
Is that what you want?

1054
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:24,150
I think there's always timefor a movie montage.

1055
01:19:33,720 --> 01:19:36,440
I hope you like how sexy I am.

1056
01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:47,270
Okay. I'm not going to be afraid.

1057
01:19:50,360 --> 01:19:51,680
I'm not.

1058
01:19:54,920 --> 01:19:58,280
It's a very bad rumour.It's a rumour. I'm serious.

1059
01:19:58,480 --> 01:19:59,600
Crap.

1060
01:20:06,680 --> 01:20:09,360
You really got my ass. It's good.

1061
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:14,070
Cut!

1062
01:20:21,880 --> 01:20:24,000
- I look beautiful.- You look amazing.

1063
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:26,840
- I look beautiful. Thank you.- You do. Amazing.

1064
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:35,560
We can sit here like this all night.

1065
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:38,680
- I bet you miss Grandma.- Grandma.

1066
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:49,080
- I'm not bah-jiggity.- You are so bah-jiggity.

1067
01:21:02,040 --> 01:21:03,960
It's Jesus. Look, it's Jesus.

1068
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,440
I guess a blowjob is out of the question?

1069
01:21:11,080 --> 01:21:12,680
That is the sweetest thing.

1070
01:21:12,760 --> 01:21:13,960
Bye!

1071
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:22,160
Well, that was fun.

1072
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:48,440
- It's over. Bye-bye, go home.- You can leave.
