1
00:00:35,618 --> 00:00:38,348
I'm late. I'm late.

2
00:00:46,229 --> 00:00:48,094
Ready for your speech, Ms. Ryan?

3
00:00:52,268 --> 00:00:54,668
Are you sure you're prepared this time?

4
00:00:57,006 --> 00:00:59,600
Are you sure you're not
forgetting anything, Jane?

5
00:01:04,781 --> 00:01:06,942
Sure you're not
forgetting anything, Jane?

6
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,445
Please welcome Jane Ryan.

7
00:01:14,891 --> 00:01:16,518
What?

8
00:01:51,427 --> 00:01:52,655
Just a dream.

9
00:02:08,912 --> 00:02:11,813
Morning, Mom. Miss you.

10
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:19,181
- Morning.
- Morning, Dad.

11
00:02:23,526 --> 00:02:25,118
I'm up.

12
00:02:25,295 --> 00:02:26,887
I'm up.

13
00:02:56,392 --> 00:02:58,724
Ladies and gentlemen,
my name is Jane Ryan.

14
00:02:58,895 --> 00:03:00,453
My name is Jane Ryan.

15
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,063
My name is Jane Ryan.

16
00:03:03,066 --> 00:03:05,091
Good morning, Justin.

17
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:07,532
"Simple Plan shoot...

18
00:03:07,704 --> 00:03:10,229
...59th and Ninth, New York City."

19
00:03:12,075 --> 00:03:15,044
- Making sure you're up.
- Yeah, just finishing an essay.

20
00:03:15,211 --> 00:03:18,647
Three weeks into school,
and you haven't cut once. I like it.

21
00:03:18,815 --> 00:03:22,307
Maybe I won't have to send you
to Sister Mary Margaret's after all.

22
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:24,818
School...

23
00:03:24,988 --> 00:03:27,252
...or Simple Plan video shoot?

24
00:03:27,423 --> 00:03:30,290
I'm here today as a finalist
for the McGill Fellowship.

25
00:03:50,413 --> 00:03:53,348
What excuses shall we
use this time, Ringo?

26
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:57,986
Ringo? Ringo, where are you?

27
00:03:58,154 --> 00:04:00,622
"Death of a pet, religious holiday...

28
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:04,817
...female problems." Last week.

29
00:04:06,262 --> 00:04:10,528
"Lllnesses. Chickenpox." Print.

30
00:04:14,904 --> 00:04:16,929
- Perfect.
- Perfect.

31
00:04:58,047 --> 00:05:00,038
Thank you, New York City!

32
00:05:01,451 --> 00:05:03,885
Ringo, there you are.

33
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:07,352
Did the little mean lady scare you?

34
00:05:07,523 --> 00:05:10,651
Yes, I know she did.

35
00:05:38,855 --> 00:05:43,815
Jane. Why do you insist on playing Mom?
Okay? Dad doesn't have time for breakfast.

36
00:05:43,993 --> 00:05:45,927
Not listening.

37
00:05:49,665 --> 00:05:52,031
- How's it going, guys?
- Hi.

38
00:05:52,201 --> 00:05:54,635
- Your breakfast is on the table.
- Smells great.

39
00:05:54,804 --> 00:05:56,704
Wait.

40
00:05:56,873 --> 00:05:58,101
- There you go.
- Thanks.

41
00:05:58,274 --> 00:06:00,037
You're welcome.

42
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:07,307
Never, ever touch my day planner.

43
00:06:07,483 --> 00:06:11,647
Okay, you need to chill on the nerd book,
okay? You have issues.

44
00:06:12,088 --> 00:06:14,784
Okay, how frequent are the contractions?

45
00:06:15,525 --> 00:06:19,461
Have them head down to the hospital.
I'll meet them there. Yeah.

46
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:23,095
- Jane...
- No, Dad, it's fine.

47
00:06:23,266 --> 00:06:26,394
No, it's not fine.
I know this is your big day.

48
00:06:26,936 --> 00:06:30,463
I will do everything I can to get
to Columbia to see your speech.

49
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:32,741
- I know you will.
- Okay, excuse me.

50
00:06:32,909 --> 00:06:36,777
Jane, sorry, I know this is the biggest day
of your academic career...

51
00:06:36,946 --> 00:06:40,643
...but Dad, will you sign my field-trip
permission form, please?

52
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:43,342
Shakespeare in the Park?
Great! Which play?

53
00:06:46,355 --> 00:06:49,449
You know, the one with
the girl and the guy...

54
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:54,259
...love, the tights, hair.
- Romeo and Juliet?

55
00:06:54,697 --> 00:06:58,326
- Yeah! Thank you. I totally blanked.
- I love that play.

56
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:01,493
- I know. Me too.
- Your mom would have been so proud.

57
00:07:05,408 --> 00:07:07,638
Would you mind giving your sister a lift?

58
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:11,678
- Not at all.
- It wouldn't kill you to spend time together.

59
00:07:13,049 --> 00:07:15,017
Breakfast was great, but I got to go.

60
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:17,175
Okay. Well, then, take this, okay?

61
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:19,480
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

62
00:07:19,655 --> 00:07:23,455
- Love you.
- Love you too. Good luck.

63
00:07:27,563 --> 00:07:31,863
- I hope you don't get caught.
- I won't.

64
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:35,663
- Let's get the show on the road.
- Think about a car wash.

65
00:07:35,838 --> 00:07:37,965
You might wanna think
about buying a car.

66
00:07:38,141 --> 00:07:41,440
- I'm saving up for college.
- That makes one of us.

67
00:07:41,944 --> 00:07:44,412
Mind putting on the radio?

68
00:07:45,181 --> 00:07:48,207
- Not at all.
- What is this?

69
00:07:50,419 --> 00:07:53,047
Too cool for school.

70
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:56,724
Yeah.

71
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:32,022
Where are we going? We have
26 minutes to get to the station...

72
00:08:32,195 --> 00:08:33,662
...and I can't be late.

73
00:08:33,829 --> 00:08:38,732
We just have to make a pit stop
at my manager's.

74
00:08:38,901 --> 00:08:40,960
Wait, you have a manager?

75
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:42,903
- Howdy, Rox.
- Hello.

76
00:08:43,072 --> 00:08:44,767
- Come on in.
- Thanks.

77
00:08:54,483 --> 00:08:55,882
Seventy-eight!

78
00:08:56,052 --> 00:08:58,885
- So how's the party?
- It's going great.

79
00:08:59,055 --> 00:09:00,920
We're on a marathon mission.

80
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:03,456
So I burned you 30. Check it out.

81
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:05,253
Thanks.

82
00:09:05,761 --> 00:09:07,888
- Why am I on the cover?
- Marketing, baby.

83
00:09:08,064 --> 00:09:11,158
- You're the hottest one in the band.
- Hey, Roxy.

84
00:09:11,334 --> 00:09:14,531
- That's not saying much.
- Here's your all-access pass.

85
00:09:14,704 --> 00:09:17,332
That will get you into the shoot.
Now, remember...

86
00:09:17,506 --> 00:09:19,804
...we've got to hit up the A-and-R guys.

87
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:23,104
- We gotta get this contract.
- How will I know it's them?

88
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,146
Middle-aged guys, fancy suits...

89
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:28,340
...bad, old-fashioned dancing.
- Right.

90
00:09:28,517 --> 00:09:30,178
- Got it? All right.
- Yes. Bye.

91
00:09:30,353 --> 00:09:32,947
- Good luck.
- Okay. Thank you.

92
00:09:36,692 --> 00:09:38,159
Yeah, 79!

93
00:09:39,629 --> 00:09:40,857
Who's there?

94
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:43,191
- Pool guy.
- Pool guy?

95
00:09:43,366 --> 00:09:44,958
You're not the pool guy.

96
00:09:45,134 --> 00:09:47,466
You get to go right to the head
of the class.

97
00:09:47,637 --> 00:09:51,596
Nassau County Department of Truancy.
Pool party's over, Flubber.

98
00:09:51,774 --> 00:09:55,107
Do you want to come over here?
Put your hands behind your head.

99
00:09:55,278 --> 00:09:58,145
On your feet, gentlemen.
Hands up where I can see them.

100
00:09:58,314 --> 00:10:00,680
- Up, up, up!
- What's going on?

101
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:04,047
You let me do the interrogating, son,
we'll get along fine.

102
00:10:06,289 --> 00:10:08,655
My mom's gonna kill me.

103
00:10:08,824 --> 00:10:13,022
Got six future felons for you, Strauss.
Each one facing five to 10...

104
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:15,186
Days of detention, Lomax.

105
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:17,457
- Days of detention.
- Just book them.

106
00:10:17,633 --> 00:10:20,431
"Book them." Would you
give it a rest, Lomax?

107
00:10:20,603 --> 00:10:23,367
You're a truancy officer,
you're not Dirty Harry.

108
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:27,498
You know, this kind of crud is what
kept you out of the force for 25 years.

109
00:10:27,677 --> 00:10:30,874
I'm on the heels of the number-one truant
in Nassau County...

110
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:33,515
...and when I find her, and I will find her...

111
00:10:33,683 --> 00:10:37,676
...your boys will be doing back flips
to make sure I'm wearing that badge.

112
00:10:37,853 --> 00:10:39,616
Hey, Einstein, over here.

113
00:10:39,789 --> 00:10:42,986
I feel bad lumping you in there
with those other losers...

114
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:47,755
...because you strike me as being a...
I don't know, a smart kid.

115
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:50,091
I see a big future here.

116
00:10:50,433 --> 00:10:54,199
I look at this face,
I see a surgeon general.

117
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:57,432
I see a Supreme Court judge.

118
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:01,936
Do you have any idea what a 10-day
suspension will look like on your record?

119
00:11:02,111 --> 00:11:05,512
You'll be lucky to be accepted
to the Acme School of Welding.

120
00:11:05,681 --> 00:11:07,012
Now...

121
00:11:07,183 --> 00:11:09,344
...do yourself a favor.

122
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:11,784
Where can I find Roxanne Ryan?

123
00:11:11,954 --> 00:11:14,320
You can give me
all the detention you like.

124
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:17,288
But if there's something I'm not,
that's a rat.

125
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:20,020
Fine. Suit yourself.

126
00:11:24,133 --> 00:11:25,862
- Car, car! Look out!
- Hold on.

127
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:29,200
What's the matter with you?!

128
00:11:32,308 --> 00:11:34,970
- Nice park.
- Thanks.

129
00:11:55,498 --> 00:11:58,626
Excuse me, could you just not?

130
00:12:00,703 --> 00:12:03,672
Okay, speech at 3.

131
00:12:04,407 --> 00:12:07,001
Perfect. Okay...

132
00:12:22,525 --> 00:12:24,322
You can't sit here. I need quiet.

133
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:27,155
Chill. You won't even know I'm here.

134
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:31,095
I'm close to winning the fellowship.
I've worked my whole life for this.

135
00:12:31,267 --> 00:12:33,167
What is this stupid thing, anyway?

136
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:36,964
This stupid thing is a four-year
scholarship to Oxford University.

137
00:12:37,139 --> 00:12:38,766
Oxford?

138
00:12:38,941 --> 00:12:41,967
- As in England?
- No, Oxford, as in nowhere near you.

139
00:12:42,144 --> 00:12:45,272
- Maybe you would like to switch seats...
- No!

140
00:12:45,448 --> 00:12:46,676
Yeah.

141
00:12:47,483 --> 00:12:50,043
- Why Oxford?
- Why are you even here?

142
00:12:51,153 --> 00:12:54,020
Because Simple Plan's shooting
their new music video.

143
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:57,356
So I'll canvass the A-and-R guys,
give them my demo...

144
00:12:57,526 --> 00:12:59,653
...and hopefully be the new opening act.

145
00:12:59,829 --> 00:13:03,026
Great. There'll be lots of concerts
at Sister Mary Margaret's.

146
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:04,757
How's the school gonna know?

147
00:13:04,934 --> 00:13:07,869
As far as they're concerned,
I'm home with the chicken...

148
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:09,664
Chickenpox.

149
00:13:15,578 --> 00:13:17,705
Chickenpox, my Aunt Fanny.

150
00:13:18,581 --> 00:13:20,208
Who is it?

151
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:23,647
It's Savitsky, your landlord.
You're two weeks late on rent.

152
00:13:23,819 --> 00:13:26,982
Mr. Savitsky,
can we deal with this later...

153
00:13:27,156 --> 00:13:30,819
...because I'm working on a very big
case right now. I'm busy.

154
00:13:30,993 --> 00:13:33,894
- You're dizzy? You should lie down.
- I said, I'm busy!

155
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:36,588
So get busy writing a check,
Lomax! Jeez.

156
00:13:42,771 --> 00:13:46,172
Where have you gone, Miss Ryan?

157
00:13:46,675 --> 00:13:48,370
Where have you gone?

158
00:13:51,113 --> 00:13:56,574
Well, your simple plan's about to get a bit
more complicated, Roxanne Ryan.

159
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,587
All right, open up.

160
00:14:09,231 --> 00:14:11,324
Can you believe this?

161
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,094
- I'm sorry.
- All right, Roxy Ryan!

162
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,295
- Oh, my God!
- It's okay!

163
00:14:16,872 --> 00:14:19,864
- I'm so sorry!
- What are you...? Stop that!

164
00:14:20,042 --> 00:14:23,478
- I'm sorry.
- What are you, a couple of monsters?

165
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:27,977
Tickets. Tickets, please.
Please have your tickets ready.

166
00:14:28,317 --> 00:14:31,616
Tickets, please. I'm not doing
this for my health. Thank you.

167
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:36,747
- I suppose you'll need some money?
- No. I can manage on my own.

168
00:14:39,328 --> 00:14:42,422
- Hello?
- Tickets. Very nice.

169
00:14:42,598 --> 00:14:44,759
Tickets, please.

170
00:14:45,601 --> 00:14:47,660
- Oh, my...
- I'm in hell.

171
00:14:47,836 --> 00:14:50,634
- I'm sorry.
- What are you looking at? Stop looking!

172
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,641
I said I was...

173
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:02,941
Ticket.

174
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:04,585
Hi.

175
00:15:06,188 --> 00:15:11,251
We are so over! Over!

176
00:15:13,629 --> 00:15:15,119
Shoot.

177
00:15:15,531 --> 00:15:16,759
Oh, very funny.

178
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:19,331
- Excuse me?
- No ticket, no ride.

179
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:22,732
- I have a ticket. Give me a minute.
- Let's see it. Come on.

180
00:15:22,905 --> 00:15:26,272
That was my twin sister you just threw off.
Right there.

181
00:15:26,442 --> 00:15:29,434
Oh, yeah. The phantom twin sister.
I'm scared. Hold me.

182
00:15:29,612 --> 00:15:31,671
Do I look that stupid to you?

183
00:15:33,082 --> 00:15:34,674
Do you want me to answer that?

184
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:37,717
- I have a ticket! It's in my purse!
- Let's go. Come on.

185
00:15:37,886 --> 00:15:39,979
Step away from the train.

186
00:15:41,123 --> 00:15:42,818
- God, I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

187
00:15:42,992 --> 00:15:44,220
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

188
00:15:44,393 --> 00:15:47,521
Here, just give me a sec, okay? One sec.

189
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:52,030
Okay. If you can't get it out,
I'll just take my skirt off.

190
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:54,460
Did I just say that out loud?

191
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:56,633
Yeah, you did.

192
00:15:58,641 --> 00:16:01,132
- Man, you're really stuck, you know that?
- Yeah.

193
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:04,370
All right, on the count of three.
One, two, three.

194
00:16:05,314 --> 00:16:07,339
Oh, my God!

195
00:16:07,516 --> 00:16:09,313
Oh, my God.

196
00:16:11,186 --> 00:16:13,416
Hey, it looks nice.

197
00:16:13,589 --> 00:16:15,386
Thanks.

198
00:16:20,596 --> 00:16:24,862
All aboard! If you have a ticket.

199
00:16:25,434 --> 00:16:27,299
I gotta go.

200
00:16:27,469 --> 00:16:30,632
- Okay.
- I'll see you.

201
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:33,701
Hopefully.

202
00:16:33,876 --> 00:16:36,868
- Bye.
- Bye.

203
00:16:43,552 --> 00:16:47,454
The ripped look? It's so two minutes ago.

204
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:51,624
Stay away from me.

205
00:16:53,362 --> 00:16:57,799
According to this schedule, it says there
should be another train in 43 minutes.

206
00:16:57,966 --> 00:17:00,730
Not today there isn't. Track construction.

207
00:17:00,903 --> 00:17:04,896
- Next train for New York leaves in 3 hours.
- You've got to be kidding me.

208
00:17:05,074 --> 00:17:06,666
- Taxi!
- Hey!

209
00:17:06,842 --> 00:17:08,742
Taxi!

210
00:17:08,911 --> 00:17:10,879
Nice move.

211
00:17:58,393 --> 00:18:00,520
There you are.

212
00:18:01,196 --> 00:18:03,187
Here I am.

213
00:18:03,365 --> 00:18:05,731
All of the taxis are gone.

214
00:18:05,901 --> 00:18:08,529
And you need a ride.

215
00:18:08,704 --> 00:18:09,932
I give you ride.

216
00:18:10,706 --> 00:18:13,004
- No.
- I give you free ride.

217
00:18:14,042 --> 00:18:16,977
No. I don't take rides from strangers.

218
00:18:17,146 --> 00:18:20,309
But I got a limo. Big, long, white one
like Barbie ride in.

219
00:18:22,584 --> 00:18:26,748
I don't believe you. It says it right here.
There's gonna be another train.

220
00:18:27,589 --> 00:18:30,717
How could I forget?
It's the magic-leprechaun train.

221
00:18:30,893 --> 00:18:34,989
It leaves for New York whenever you want.
Powered by your imagination.

222
00:18:35,764 --> 00:18:38,358
- Jane!
- I'm sorry, is someone talking?

223
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:40,161
Because I don't hear anyone.

224
00:18:40,335 --> 00:18:44,169
I just wanna let you know I have a limo
if you're looking for a ride.

225
00:18:44,339 --> 00:18:46,967
Don't worry,
it's a professional car service.

226
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:51,104
Your attention please, the 9:45 to...

227
00:18:51,346 --> 00:18:53,211
- Thanks.
- Here, let me get your bag.

228
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:56,112
- No, it's okay. I got it.
- But I insist.

229
00:18:56,285 --> 00:18:58,014
No, it's okay. I insist.

230
00:18:58,187 --> 00:19:00,178
Wait for me.

231
00:19:00,355 --> 00:19:04,485
My personal assistant.
I'd be lost without her.

232
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:07,925
My name's Bennie.
You and her going same place?

233
00:19:08,096 --> 00:19:12,556
"You and she." The correct grammar is "she."
See, you're using the wrong possessive...

234
00:19:13,602 --> 00:19:14,762
Smarty pants.

235
00:19:14,937 --> 00:19:18,532
You've reached the Ryan residence.
Leave your message after the beep.

236
00:19:19,107 --> 00:19:21,507
Yeah, Dr. Ryan, this is Max Lomax...

237
00:19:21,677 --> 00:19:23,736
...Nassau County Department of Truancy.

238
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:26,745
I'm calling in regard to
your daughter Roxanne.

239
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:30,316
Could you call me at 993-1176...

240
00:19:30,485 --> 00:19:35,752
...and reference case number
7 Tango Niner Popcorn X-ray 5?

241
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:38,586
Have a pleasant day.

242
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:56,641
How's it going?

243
00:19:59,181 --> 00:20:01,342
How you doing?

244
00:20:05,854 --> 00:20:07,253
Stop it.

245
00:20:07,422 --> 00:20:10,323
- Roxy, please. I can't concentrate.
- What's up?

246
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:16,690
Please stop.

247
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:26,168
Get me Ma.

248
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:29,633
It's number-one adopted son.

249
00:20:30,012 --> 00:20:33,709
Bennie? You said you be here by 9 a.m.

250
00:20:33,882 --> 00:20:37,113
That was 20 minutes ago.
I need that chip.

251
00:20:37,286 --> 00:20:39,379
Bennie will be there soon, Ma.

252
00:20:39,554 --> 00:20:43,217
Bennie, either you talk in Chinese
or you speak in English.

253
00:20:43,392 --> 00:20:45,019
But enough with the accent.

254
00:20:45,193 --> 00:20:48,253
- I'm sorry, Ma.
- Don't call me Ma.

255
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:51,831
From 9 to 5, you're my number-one
killing machine.

256
00:20:53,535 --> 00:20:56,470
Yes, I'm your killing machine, Ma.

257
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:01,137
Bye, Ma.

258
00:21:06,448 --> 00:21:08,348
Kids.

259
00:21:49,758 --> 00:21:52,591
Hey, bud? Are you lost?

260
00:21:57,299 --> 00:21:59,324
Ancient Chinese proverb:

261
00:22:00,268 --> 00:22:03,169
Never accept ride from stranger!

262
00:22:05,173 --> 00:22:08,074
- Help! Help us!
- Help!

263
00:22:08,877 --> 00:22:13,007
- Help! He's gonna kill us!
- Help!

264
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,616
Come on! Hurry!

265
00:22:18,153 --> 00:22:20,087
Okay, let's go! Come on.

266
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:23,918
Thank you.

267
00:22:40,642 --> 00:22:42,974
- Why is he after us?
- Go!

268
00:22:47,382 --> 00:22:49,873
- I think we lost him.
- There you are.

269
00:23:03,398 --> 00:23:06,834
- You speak Chinese?
- There's a lot you don't know about me.

270
00:23:07,836 --> 00:23:10,805
- Give me that!
- Hey, buster!

271
00:23:17,012 --> 00:23:19,139
Bring it on, tubby.

272
00:23:19,581 --> 00:23:22,015
I didn't know you took jujitsu.

273
00:23:22,184 --> 00:23:24,812
- Tae kwon do.
- Thanks.

274
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:26,248
Two times a week.

275
00:23:26,521 --> 00:23:28,113
Three years.

276
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:34,022
- Now I'm mad.
- What are you...?

277
00:23:36,298 --> 00:23:38,493
- That hurt.
- Here we go.

278
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:43,498
Yeah!

279
00:23:48,977 --> 00:23:51,138
I'm gonna kill you!

280
00:23:53,715 --> 00:23:56,309
That's what we get for
taking a ride from a stranger.

281
00:23:56,485 --> 00:23:59,511
- Please. It was exciting.
- Exciting?

282
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:03,954
Almost being mugged and getting stuck
in the middle of nowhere is not exciting.

283
00:24:05,193 --> 00:24:06,888
Now what?

284
00:24:07,729 --> 00:24:09,253
These were my best heels.

285
00:24:09,431 --> 00:24:10,898
Give me the other one.

286
00:24:11,133 --> 00:24:13,727
Give me the shoe. Please. Thank you.

287
00:24:19,808 --> 00:24:21,469
Now they're your best flats.

288
00:24:23,612 --> 00:24:25,705
Either of you ladies spare some change?

289
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:28,907
- Oh, yeah, here.
- You're feeding this poor man's disease.

290
00:24:29,084 --> 00:24:32,713
- Just let him have the dollar.
- Buy him a snack, like a granola bar.

291
00:24:36,024 --> 00:24:37,753
Thanks. I got a dollar!

292
00:24:37,926 --> 00:24:40,986
That is not just a cherry Slurpee.

293
00:24:41,363 --> 00:24:43,854
I smell alcohol. Please don't freak.

294
00:24:47,836 --> 00:24:49,269
Or not.

295
00:25:03,618 --> 00:25:05,085
Yes!

296
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:11,214
Now we're cooking with gas.
Out of the way, suckers.

297
00:25:12,727 --> 00:25:16,060
Come on, folks. Police emergency.

298
00:25:16,231 --> 00:25:17,459
Come on!

299
00:25:17,632 --> 00:25:22,626
Back up, people. Clear the street.
You call this respect for the law?

300
00:25:23,171 --> 00:25:25,435
I look like a duck waddling
in these shoes.

301
00:25:27,676 --> 00:25:29,644
DVD.

302
00:25:31,046 --> 00:25:34,277
Very cheap. Need Holiday.

303
00:25:36,051 --> 00:25:37,951
Wait!

304
00:25:42,691 --> 00:25:44,955
Great. Just great.

305
00:25:46,528 --> 00:25:49,793
- Can I use your restroom?
- Bathroom is for customer only.

306
00:25:56,104 --> 00:25:57,935
Down the aisle to the left.

307
00:25:59,174 --> 00:26:02,507
She has her whole life ahead of her.
She should not be drinking.

308
00:26:02,677 --> 00:26:04,304
That's what I keep telling her.

309
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:39,344
You've reached the Ryan residence.
Leave your message...

310
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:41,641
You have one new message.

311
00:26:41,816 --> 00:26:43,841
Yeah, Dr. Ryan, this is Max Lomax...

312
00:26:44,119 --> 00:26:48,783
...Nassau County Department of Truancy.
- Correction, this was Max Lomax.

313
00:26:57,966 --> 00:27:01,527
- These for now, those for later.
- Very hungry for a small person.

314
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:03,864
- Thirsty too? Okay.
- Red Bull.

315
00:27:14,149 --> 00:27:16,310
- You'll never pull it off.
- Never?

316
00:27:16,484 --> 00:27:19,248
- Not today. Not tomorrow.
- So no.

317
00:27:26,461 --> 00:27:28,088
I like the yellow one better.

318
00:27:28,263 --> 00:27:29,594
Really?

319
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:36,060
What did you do, fall in?

320
00:27:36,237 --> 00:27:37,534
Cash or charge?

321
00:27:39,808 --> 00:27:41,935
I need some money.

322
00:27:42,477 --> 00:27:45,071
Total amount is 47.24.

323
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:48,142
Oh, my God! My day planner!

324
00:27:48,316 --> 00:27:53,948
I must have left it in the limo! My life is in
it! My speech, my credit cards, my money!

325
00:27:55,323 --> 00:27:58,224
So I don't suppose I could start a tab?

326
00:27:58,393 --> 00:28:00,293
Tab is for valid customers only.

327
00:28:00,462 --> 00:28:02,225
Thank you. Don't come again.

328
00:28:03,898 --> 00:28:05,627
This is all your fault.

329
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:08,132
How's it my fault you left
the book in the limo?

330
00:28:08,303 --> 00:28:11,966
It's your fault I was even in the limo.

331
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:14,700
I can't even function
without my day planner.

332
00:28:14,876 --> 00:28:17,470
I'm trying to think of a reason
to keep on living.

333
00:28:17,645 --> 00:28:21,581
Still trying. Still trying.

334
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:24,742
- You need to chill. You just need to relax.
- Relax?

335
00:28:25,053 --> 00:28:29,046
How am I supposed to relax?
My relaxation tapes are in my day planner!

336
00:28:34,028 --> 00:28:37,054
- Snap out of it!
- Don't hit me.

337
00:28:37,265 --> 00:28:42,225
Listen. Okay, your speech doesn't start until
3:00. That gives you three and a half hours!

338
00:28:44,304 --> 00:28:46,329
- Four and a half.
- Same thing.

339
00:28:46,507 --> 00:28:49,670
Roxy, spontaneity doesn't just happen.

340
00:28:49,843 --> 00:28:51,970
You have to get there and rehearse.

341
00:28:53,947 --> 00:28:56,415
Besides, where am I gonna
get cleaned up?

342
00:28:56,583 --> 00:28:58,278
I have a plan.

343
00:28:58,452 --> 00:28:59,817
Checking in, ladies?

344
00:28:59,987 --> 00:29:01,454
- We're with the band.
- Yeah.

345
00:29:01,622 --> 00:29:03,613
- Well, then.
- I'm Paris, this is Nicky.

346
00:29:03,791 --> 00:29:05,019
Welcome, Paris.

347
00:29:05,292 --> 00:29:07,886
- How could you let them go?
- Well, they're very smart.

348
00:29:08,062 --> 00:29:11,361
- One of them even spoke Chinese.
- I don't care.

349
00:29:11,532 --> 00:29:13,796
What's so important
about this stupid chip?

350
00:29:13,967 --> 00:29:17,698
That stupid chip contains millions of dollars
in pirated music.

351
00:29:17,871 --> 00:29:19,839
Pirate music? You mean:

352
00:29:21,375 --> 00:29:22,569
Bennie!

353
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:25,806
Okay. I know what you mean.
I was just kidding.

354
00:29:25,979 --> 00:29:27,879
We send chip to Hong Kong...

355
00:29:28,048 --> 00:29:30,881
...they transfer it from chip
onto compact disk.

356
00:29:31,418 --> 00:29:35,320
They sell pirated copies,
and we make millions.

357
00:29:36,023 --> 00:29:38,924
Okay, I understand.

358
00:29:39,093 --> 00:29:42,654
I'll get the chip back
and restore honor to family.

359
00:29:43,263 --> 00:29:46,027
After all, I am your
number-one adopted son.

360
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:49,795
Get chip, make compact disk,
sell to teenagers.

361
00:30:05,185 --> 00:30:06,447
What are we doing here?

362
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:08,144
Watch and learn.

363
00:30:09,389 --> 00:30:10,617
I'd love to.

364
00:30:10,791 --> 00:30:15,057
But I'm presenting an award this afternoon.
You know that.

365
00:30:15,295 --> 00:30:17,695
Carey, come. Hurry, hurry.

366
00:30:19,566 --> 00:30:21,534
Now!

367
00:30:26,273 --> 00:30:28,138
This is your plan?

368
00:30:28,308 --> 00:30:30,299
Yep. And a pretty good one.

369
00:30:31,044 --> 00:30:36,004
Breaking into a hotel room is exactly how
Nixon went down. I'm not going in there.

370
00:30:36,183 --> 00:30:40,119
Not going in there.
I'm not going in there.

371
00:30:42,189 --> 00:30:44,453
Okay, I'm going in there.

372
00:30:45,325 --> 00:30:49,318
Okay, I'm just going to get cleaned up,
and then we're out of here.

373
00:30:49,496 --> 00:30:51,123
Clean up, get out.

374
00:30:54,468 --> 00:30:56,129
What?

375
00:30:57,171 --> 00:31:00,231
- It's a...
- Dog.

376
00:31:02,442 --> 00:31:04,376
I think.

377
00:31:05,045 --> 00:31:06,444
Well...

378
00:31:06,613 --> 00:31:08,547
...you take a shower first...

379
00:31:08,715 --> 00:31:11,411
...and I'll take the doggy.
Come on, puppy.

380
00:31:19,893 --> 00:31:22,487
- Jane Ryan speaking.
- I have your date book.

381
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:25,295
- Roxy!
- What?

382
00:31:26,066 --> 00:31:29,058
- What?
- It's the psycho. He has my day planner.

383
00:31:29,236 --> 00:31:31,204
Let me... I'll talk to him.

384
00:31:31,371 --> 00:31:33,066
- Be nice.
- Okay.

385
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:36,073
- Listen, you...
- I told you to be nice.

386
00:31:37,344 --> 00:31:38,572
You can take money...

387
00:31:38,745 --> 00:31:42,237
...you can have the credit cards,
just please don't hurt my speech.

388
00:31:42,416 --> 00:31:44,611
Shut up. I talk, you listen.

389
00:31:44,785 --> 00:31:47,618
- Okay. Good idea.
- You took my chip.

390
00:31:48,121 --> 00:31:49,986
Roxy, did you eat this man's chips?

391
00:31:50,324 --> 00:31:51,757
- No.
- You sure?

392
00:31:52,793 --> 00:31:55,921
- I didn't eat his chips.
- She didn't eat your chips.

393
00:31:56,530 --> 00:32:00,796
No, not chips. Chip. My microchip.

394
00:32:00,968 --> 00:32:03,402
Listen, we need that book back.

395
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:08,769
So meet us outside the Plaza Hotel
in 30 minutes, or I will eat your chips.

396
00:32:32,899 --> 00:32:36,062
Found the chip!

397
00:32:48,682 --> 00:32:51,150
- Hi.
- Hi.

398
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,422
Is today my birthday?

399
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:06,424
Oh, my God. I'm sorry.
We're just leaving.

400
00:33:07,067 --> 00:33:09,695
- My sister.
- There's gonna be a five-alarm fire...

401
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:13,067
...if my mom finds you.
- This psycho stole my day planner...

402
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:17,074
...which has my entire life in it.
Now we have to give him his chip back.

403
00:33:17,244 --> 00:33:22,113
Okay, so psycho, day planner,
computer chip...

404
00:33:22,382 --> 00:33:24,247
Yeah, makes perfect sense to me.

405
00:33:24,551 --> 00:33:26,610
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

406
00:33:27,988 --> 00:33:31,116
But you might have a little trouble
swapping the chip.

407
00:33:31,291 --> 00:33:34,260
- Why?
- Because Reinaldo just ate it.

408
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:39,296
No. No, he didn't.

409
00:33:39,466 --> 00:33:42,560
- Are you serious?
- The little green thing, he just ate it.

410
00:33:42,869 --> 00:33:45,133
- Spit it out. Come on.
- Hello?

411
00:33:45,305 --> 00:33:47,739
- Hello, Trey.
- Hi, Mom.

412
00:33:47,908 --> 00:33:50,240
I'm on my way up. Change of schedule.

413
00:33:50,410 --> 00:33:52,935
Bring my purse, dear.
I'm meeting Hillary at 1.

414
00:33:53,146 --> 00:33:54,943
Okay.

415
00:33:55,115 --> 00:33:57,606
All right. So my mom's on her way up.

416
00:33:57,851 --> 00:34:00,581
She's a senator. Anne Baxter Lipton.

417
00:34:02,155 --> 00:34:05,124
- A senator?
- Should've kept that little fact to yourself.

418
00:34:05,292 --> 00:34:06,520
- A senator.
- Yeah.

419
00:34:06,693 --> 00:34:08,718
I can never run for office now.

420
00:34:09,463 --> 00:34:12,057
- Come here, little puppy.
- I'll be right back.

421
00:34:12,466 --> 00:34:14,434
- Get it out.
- Shake it out.

422
00:34:14,601 --> 00:34:16,501
- Shake it out.
- Spit it out.

423
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:18,297
- Hey, easy...
- A senator?

424
00:34:18,472 --> 00:34:20,497
- Come on.
- The dog ate the chip.

425
00:34:21,041 --> 00:34:23,100
I need the chip to get the day planner.

426
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:25,642
- This isn't happening.
- He bit me!

427
00:34:25,812 --> 00:34:27,939
Calm down. I don't want it.

428
00:34:28,115 --> 00:34:29,742
Don't throw him.

429
00:34:32,619 --> 00:34:34,314
- Keep it!
- You take him!

430
00:34:37,391 --> 00:34:38,858
My bad.

431
00:34:40,727 --> 00:34:43,423
Oh, thank God. Reinaldo.

432
00:34:43,997 --> 00:34:47,694
Jane, what are you doing?
You're gonna wind up dead!

433
00:34:47,968 --> 00:34:50,266
Without that chip, I am dead.

434
00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:54,201
Okay. Come back here.
Come here, doggy.

435
00:34:54,374 --> 00:34:57,741
Okay. Here we go. Okay.

436
00:35:00,881 --> 00:35:02,678
Trey? Trey?

437
00:35:02,849 --> 00:35:04,714
- My mom.
- Why is the door locked?

438
00:35:04,885 --> 00:35:08,048
- I'll be late for the Simple Plan shoot.
- The video shoot?

439
00:35:08,221 --> 00:35:10,189
- Yeah.
- Trey? Hello?

440
00:35:10,357 --> 00:35:12,882
- At least tell me your name before you go.
- Roxy.

441
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:16,186
- Roxy.
- Jane. Come here.

442
00:35:16,363 --> 00:35:19,298
I was taking a nap. Sorry.

443
00:35:20,066 --> 00:35:22,967
Look what I got my little boy for lunch.

444
00:35:23,136 --> 00:35:24,569
Thanks, Mom. I already ate.

445
00:35:25,505 --> 00:35:26,938
Reinaldo.

446
00:35:27,107 --> 00:35:30,838
Reinaldo, come here, boy.
Look what Mommy has for you.

447
00:35:31,011 --> 00:35:35,038
Come here, my precious little baby.
Where's my...? Come on.

448
00:35:35,215 --> 00:35:39,311
Look what Mommy has.
Reinaldo, don't make Mommy beg.

449
00:35:41,188 --> 00:35:43,850
- Hold on.
- Come here, doggy. Doggy.

450
00:35:44,024 --> 00:35:47,050
Trey. Where is Reinaldo?
He always answers when I call.

451
00:35:47,227 --> 00:35:48,660
He's not answering.

452
00:35:48,829 --> 00:35:52,162
Come here, doggy.
So I can stick my finger down your throat.

453
00:35:52,666 --> 00:35:56,397
Whatever you do, don't look down.

454
00:35:57,971 --> 00:36:00,940
Mom, there's something
you should know, okay?

455
00:36:01,107 --> 00:36:04,440
Now, Reinaldo, he...

456
00:36:05,545 --> 00:36:07,342
I took him to the groomer's.

457
00:36:07,581 --> 00:36:09,048
Why would you do that?

458
00:36:09,249 --> 00:36:12,616
Because he smelled.

459
00:36:16,122 --> 00:36:19,057
- Don't worry. We're getting out of here.
- I can't move.

460
00:36:19,226 --> 00:36:23,526
Oh, God, I almost forgot. I gotta go.
I gotta... Yeah. I'm going to be late.

461
00:36:23,697 --> 00:36:25,631
Don't forget to pick up Reinaldo.

462
00:36:25,799 --> 00:36:27,426
Give me the dog.

463
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:33,997
Deals like this are the result of years
of really hard work.

464
00:36:34,174 --> 00:36:37,439
Things don't just fall out of the sky.

465
00:36:37,611 --> 00:36:39,545
- How you doing?
- Going down!

466
00:36:58,265 --> 00:37:00,756
- That wasn't so bad.
- No.

467
00:37:01,635 --> 00:37:03,899
Can I have my towel, please?

468
00:37:11,912 --> 00:37:13,140
- Sir, I need your help.
- Yes, sir.

469
00:37:13,313 --> 00:37:15,281
Help me find a dog
and two girls in towels.

470
00:37:15,448 --> 00:37:17,439
Who exactly are they?

471
00:37:17,617 --> 00:37:21,053
Okay, puppy. Okay. Go home.
You need to go home.

472
00:37:21,221 --> 00:37:23,121
- What are you doing?
- We need to go.

473
00:37:23,290 --> 00:37:24,518
No, we need that dog.

474
00:37:24,691 --> 00:37:28,149
That dog is my life. And when he poops,
his poop is my life.

475
00:37:28,328 --> 00:37:30,956
Come on, Reinaldo! Come on.

476
00:37:31,131 --> 00:37:34,328
- Good puppy. Okay.
- Can anything else go wrong today?

477
00:37:41,875 --> 00:37:45,106
- Am I squashing you?
- Yeah. It's great.

478
00:37:45,378 --> 00:37:48,814
- Did I just...?
- Yeah. You just said that out loud.

479
00:37:48,982 --> 00:37:53,510
If we keep bumping into each other like
this, one of us is gonna get hurt.

480
00:37:53,687 --> 00:37:55,382
I'm willing to take that chance.

481
00:37:55,555 --> 00:37:58,023
- Roxy!
- Paris! Nicky!

482
00:37:58,191 --> 00:38:01,957
- How can I find you?
- Call her. 555-8989.

483
00:38:02,128 --> 00:38:03,993
She's home every night.

484
00:38:04,164 --> 00:38:06,223
- What's your name?
- It's Jane.

485
00:38:06,399 --> 00:38:07,627
I'm Jim!

486
00:39:17,437 --> 00:39:20,031
Here. How am I gonna survive
without my watch?

487
00:39:20,306 --> 00:39:21,898
I don't know.

488
00:39:22,375 --> 00:39:27,142
Come on. You can poopy.
Just a little one. Come on.

489
00:39:27,781 --> 00:39:29,112
Any luck?

490
00:39:30,483 --> 00:39:32,474
Think we have something.

491
00:39:35,188 --> 00:39:37,554
- False alarm.
- I can't go looking like this.

492
00:39:37,724 --> 00:39:41,251
- I'm starting to have heart palpitations.
- No, don't worry, okay?

493
00:39:41,428 --> 00:39:43,896
We're gonna fix you up. I promise.

494
00:39:45,598 --> 00:39:49,432
It's all gonna work out.
Where are you going?

495
00:39:49,669 --> 00:39:51,102
To get my day planner back.

496
00:39:52,639 --> 00:39:54,266
- I'll go with you.
- No.

497
00:39:55,008 --> 00:39:57,238
I don't think that's such a good idea.

498
00:39:57,410 --> 00:40:00,402
Our togetherness today
hasn't exactly been good luck.

499
00:40:01,881 --> 00:40:03,143
Rox, I'll be fine.

500
00:40:03,516 --> 00:40:06,451
It's in front of the Plaza.
There's a lot of witnesses.

501
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:09,951
It's not like this guy's exactly,
like, a criminal mastermind.

502
00:40:10,123 --> 00:40:12,148
So have fun at the concert.

503
00:40:13,026 --> 00:40:14,493
Video shoot.

504
00:40:15,695 --> 00:40:19,324
59th and Ninth. If you care.

505
00:40:31,911 --> 00:40:34,072
Okay, kiddies.

506
00:40:34,247 --> 00:40:36,181
Playtime's over.

507
00:40:39,552 --> 00:40:41,383
Where do you think you're going?

508
00:40:41,554 --> 00:40:44,352
I'm on a case.
Where do you think you're going?

509
00:40:44,691 --> 00:40:47,057
What do you mean?
I'm not going anywhere.

510
00:40:47,227 --> 00:40:48,990
So we're clear on that.

511
00:40:49,162 --> 00:40:51,596
Yeah. I didn't think so.

512
00:40:58,271 --> 00:41:00,239
Jeff. What's up, man? It's Trey.

513
00:41:00,406 --> 00:41:04,240
Hey, you remember that Simple Plan
video shoot you were telling me about?

514
00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:07,777
Yeah. Where is it?
It's 59th and Ninth. Are you sure?

515
00:41:07,947 --> 00:41:11,075
That's awesome, man. You rock.
I owe you. Bye.

516
00:41:11,684 --> 00:41:15,552
Boy, talk about anal-retentive.
This girl is a cuckoo bird.

517
00:41:18,725 --> 00:41:23,719
I'm surprised she doesn't have trips to the
bathroom scheduled. Wait, right here, 3:30.

518
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:27,090
- Look, I think we...
- You're late.

519
00:41:27,801 --> 00:41:30,497
I think we got off on the wrong foot
a while back.

520
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:32,934
I just wanna know... Okay.

521
00:41:36,676 --> 00:41:38,041
Give me my chip.

522
00:41:39,345 --> 00:41:41,040
- What's this?
- It's your chip.

523
00:41:41,214 --> 00:41:44,741
- Excuse me?
- Well, you see, Reinaldo here...

524
00:41:45,084 --> 00:41:47,348
...he ate your chip.
- Reinaldo ate my chip.

525
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,681
- Is this some kind of joke?
- I don't joke.

526
00:41:49,856 --> 00:41:51,483
Can I have my day planner back?

527
00:41:51,658 --> 00:41:55,594
You know what I think I do?
I think I run over the dog with the car.

528
00:41:55,762 --> 00:41:58,560
No, wait, that might damage the chip.

529
00:41:58,731 --> 00:42:01,928
You give me my chip, or I'll kill you!
Cough it up, pooch.

530
00:42:02,635 --> 00:42:04,262
No, no. Please don't hurt him.

531
00:42:04,437 --> 00:42:06,234
Give it to me. Let me have it!

532
00:42:09,175 --> 00:42:10,403
Good shot, Reinaldo.

533
00:42:15,081 --> 00:42:16,708
Disgusting!

534
00:42:29,929 --> 00:42:33,456
Mike one, check. Testing, one, two.
One, two.

535
00:42:33,633 --> 00:42:35,567
Excuse me, fellas.

536
00:42:35,735 --> 00:42:38,499
Excuse me, Cochise. Thattaboy.

537
00:42:38,905 --> 00:42:41,931
- I'm so excited.
- Thanks.

538
00:42:42,108 --> 00:42:44,406
- You're good.
- Roxy.

539
00:42:46,246 --> 00:42:47,907
- Hi.
- Hey.

540
00:42:48,948 --> 00:42:52,543
I was wondering if you knew
where my mom's dog was.

541
00:42:52,719 --> 00:42:56,951
But I mean, I also wanted
to see you again.

542
00:42:58,191 --> 00:42:59,249
Come on! Move it!

543
00:42:59,425 --> 00:43:02,019
- Do you have a pass?
- No.

544
00:43:02,195 --> 00:43:04,459
I'll be right back, okay?
So just stay here.

545
00:43:04,631 --> 00:43:07,657
- I'll figure it out.
- Figure it out somewhere else, okay?

546
00:43:10,103 --> 00:43:11,832
Simple Plan.

547
00:43:12,005 --> 00:43:13,768
They rock.

548
00:43:17,243 --> 00:43:19,677
Got all their LPs.

549
00:43:21,648 --> 00:43:25,448
I'm sorry, I didn't get your name.
Is it Loser?

550
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:28,512
How come you're not in school?

551
00:43:28,922 --> 00:43:32,949
Okay, okay. Don't worry.
I've got bigger fish to fry.

552
00:43:33,393 --> 00:43:36,954
- Excuse me. Coming through.
- Thanks for coming to this video shoot.

553
00:43:37,130 --> 00:43:39,655
We're gonna need
a lot of your energy today.

554
00:43:39,866 --> 00:43:42,562
So are you guys ready?

555
00:43:42,735 --> 00:43:44,225
Are we ready?

556
00:43:44,404 --> 00:43:45,632
Rox, where are you?

557
00:43:45,805 --> 00:43:49,741
This is the scene live in midtown,
where punk-rock group Simple Plan...

558
00:43:49,909 --> 00:43:53,345
...is shooting their latest music video.
- A little louder!

559
00:43:54,247 --> 00:43:58,843
Nice. Get ready. Welcome, Simple Plan!

560
00:44:03,389 --> 00:44:07,018
What's up, New York City?

561
00:44:55,141 --> 00:44:56,972
Old-school dance moves.

562
00:45:13,026 --> 00:45:16,484
Hi. Please give it a listen.
Our contact info's inside.

563
00:45:16,662 --> 00:45:19,096
- Nice packaging. Let's take a look.
- Thanks.

564
00:45:19,265 --> 00:45:21,631
Hello, Miss Ryan.

565
00:45:21,901 --> 00:45:26,065
So nice to finally meet you face to face.

566
00:45:26,639 --> 00:45:29,699
It's been quite a chase
all these years, huh?

567
00:45:29,942 --> 00:45:34,174
One not without a few clever maneuvers
on your part...

568
00:45:34,347 --> 00:45:38,784
...but here we are.
- You know what? I'm tired of running.

569
00:45:38,985 --> 00:45:43,319
- I'll go quietly.
- I don't use handcuffs, Miss Ryan.

570
00:45:44,090 --> 00:45:47,526
- Just brains.
- But before we go, Mr. Lomax...

571
00:45:47,693 --> 00:45:49,661
- Yeah?
- Check your fly.

572
00:45:49,829 --> 00:45:51,660
What's that?

573
00:45:56,302 --> 00:45:59,863
- I have to get by.
- Where do you think you're going?

574
00:46:00,373 --> 00:46:02,705
You may want to check your fly.

575
00:46:23,830 --> 00:46:25,127
Roxy!

576
00:46:30,470 --> 00:46:31,869
Hey, man, what's up?

577
00:46:35,908 --> 00:46:37,808
It's Lomax.

578
00:46:37,977 --> 00:46:40,343
Everybody, jump. Jump!

579
00:46:47,887 --> 00:46:49,149
Roxy!

580
00:47:10,977 --> 00:47:12,911
- Lomax!
- Lomax?

581
00:47:13,079 --> 00:47:14,706
Lomax?

582
00:47:15,314 --> 00:47:17,282
- We're trapped.
- Take my hand.

583
00:47:34,667 --> 00:47:36,259
Roxy?

584
00:47:38,437 --> 00:47:39,734
Roxy!

585
00:47:43,442 --> 00:47:45,740
Has everybody washed their hands?

586
00:47:49,415 --> 00:47:51,315
I'm next!

587
00:47:57,456 --> 00:47:59,356
That's gotta hurt.

588
00:48:02,028 --> 00:48:05,987
Sorry about that. Sorry. Excuse me.
I'm sorry, guys. Excuse me.

589
00:48:06,232 --> 00:48:09,998
I'm looking for two girls and this little dog
that just ran out of here.

590
00:48:10,169 --> 00:48:12,603
- Did you see where they went?
- I did.

591
00:48:12,772 --> 00:48:15,673
- They went to the Simple Plan after-party.
- Great.

592
00:48:15,841 --> 00:48:18,833
You know, I'm going there now.
I drive all the VIPs.

593
00:48:19,011 --> 00:48:22,777
- I could give you a ride.
- Yeah? Thanks, man.

594
00:48:22,949 --> 00:48:24,541
Thanks.

595
00:48:29,655 --> 00:48:31,782
- This Lomax guy is crazy.
- I know.

596
00:48:38,297 --> 00:48:39,525
Okay.

597
00:48:39,699 --> 00:48:42,259
- Let's hide in the tent.
- Okay.

598
00:48:50,409 --> 00:48:52,434
Cover up the manhole. We're done here.

599
00:48:53,546 --> 00:48:54,945
Give me a hand!

600
00:48:58,684 --> 00:49:01,881
The climactic event
of my academic career is in two hours.

601
00:49:02,054 --> 00:49:05,455
And I'm drenched with a dog
in a sewer. Yeah.

602
00:49:05,625 --> 00:49:08,116
No. See, we're in luck.
It's just the water main.

603
00:49:09,695 --> 00:49:14,655
- I'm just trying to look on the bright side.
- Bright side? There is no bright side.

604
00:49:15,368 --> 00:49:18,997
Well, I don't know. I was thinking that...

605
00:49:19,205 --> 00:49:20,433
That what?

606
00:49:20,706 --> 00:49:25,006
We haven't spent
the day together in years.

607
00:49:25,511 --> 00:49:30,380
And today has made me realize
how much I've missed that.

608
00:49:30,783 --> 00:49:33,513
And I don't know, I was having fun.

609
00:49:33,753 --> 00:49:36,813
And you were too, because I saw
the smile on your face...

610
00:49:36,989 --> 00:49:39,150
...when we were crowd surfing.

611
00:49:39,325 --> 00:49:44,228
- I was acting for the cameras.
- Just a little bit.

612
00:49:44,797 --> 00:49:47,823
Okay, so maybe it was a little fun.

613
00:49:48,834 --> 00:49:51,826
- What's with that Lomax guy?
- He's the truant officer.

614
00:49:52,004 --> 00:49:55,940
He's been after me for years,
but I outsmart him every time.

615
00:49:56,142 --> 00:49:57,837
What can I say?

616
00:49:58,577 --> 00:50:00,340
You're insane. You know that?

617
00:50:00,746 --> 00:50:02,611
Yeah. I know.

618
00:50:08,187 --> 00:50:09,950
You okay, buddy?

619
00:50:10,222 --> 00:50:13,020
Yeah, I'm doing just fine,
Sherlock. Yourself?

620
00:50:13,192 --> 00:50:16,059
Wife and kids? Think it'll rain?
How about those Mets?

621
00:50:16,228 --> 00:50:18,423
Are we through chitchatting?

622
00:50:18,597 --> 00:50:20,497
Tell me where this sewer pipe leads?

623
00:50:20,766 --> 00:50:24,258
Well, that one there comes directly
from the main line on 125th.

624
00:50:24,637 --> 00:50:27,003
Only way in or out.

625
00:50:33,045 --> 00:50:36,105
- How's the patient?
- She should've gone for the C-section.

626
00:50:36,482 --> 00:50:39,144
I'm gonna miss my daughter's speech
at Columbia.

627
00:50:39,318 --> 00:50:41,946
She's gonna be so disappointed.
I hope she's okay.

628
00:50:46,058 --> 00:50:49,960
The unpublicized event has drawn
quite a crowd here today.

629
00:50:50,162 --> 00:50:52,323
Come on, move off the road. Please?

630
00:51:02,408 --> 00:51:04,342
Hi, it's Jane. Leave a message.

631
00:51:04,543 --> 00:51:07,307
Jane. Hey, it's Jim.

632
00:51:07,546 --> 00:51:12,074
The guy that ripped your skirt
and pummeled you with his bike.

633
00:51:12,518 --> 00:51:14,042
Sorry about that.

634
00:51:15,287 --> 00:51:19,383
Anyway, I was just calling
to make sure you're okay.

635
00:51:19,759 --> 00:51:21,624
So...

636
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:26,022
I'll keep looking for you.
I'm gonna make it up to you. All right?

637
00:51:26,399 --> 00:51:28,094
See you.

638
00:51:30,336 --> 00:51:33,669
We need to get out of here.
This thing is never-ending.

639
00:51:33,873 --> 00:51:36,535
Wait a sec. Columbia's
on 116th Street, right?

640
00:51:36,709 --> 00:51:38,404
Right.

641
00:51:38,711 --> 00:51:40,144
I got you nine blocks away.

642
00:51:48,454 --> 00:51:51,150
She can't get a date
because she sounds fat...

643
00:51:51,323 --> 00:51:53,348
What's up with this fool?

644
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:56,853
White people are crazy.

645
00:51:57,730 --> 00:51:59,561
Roxy, Columbia's on the West Side.

646
00:52:04,937 --> 00:52:08,532
- Here we are. Let's find a subway.
- Let's ask the House of Bling.

647
00:52:08,707 --> 00:52:10,174
Good idea.

648
00:52:16,081 --> 00:52:19,482
- Can I help you?
- We are so not in Kansas anymore.

649
00:52:21,987 --> 00:52:24,615
We're from the gas company.

650
00:52:25,157 --> 00:52:27,955
- No gas here. Okay.
- Hold it.

651
00:52:28,127 --> 00:52:32,496
I can't have anyone seeing you leave
my store looking like that.

652
00:52:32,665 --> 00:52:35,691
- Mickey, show them out the back way.
- Okay, Ma.

653
00:52:36,268 --> 00:52:38,202
Oh, come on.

654
00:52:39,371 --> 00:52:42,499
- What? What is it?
- It's 1:13.

655
00:52:42,675 --> 00:52:45,109
It's 1:13. I'm never gonna make it.

656
00:52:45,277 --> 00:52:46,744
What's wrong with that girl?

657
00:52:46,912 --> 00:52:51,508
- She doesn't do well under pressure.
- Oh, my God! I'm having a heart attack!

658
00:52:51,684 --> 00:52:53,413
- Call 991. Call 991.
- Breathe.

659
00:52:53,586 --> 00:52:56,077
Call 991! 991?

660
00:52:56,255 --> 00:52:57,779
Stay calm!

661
00:52:59,558 --> 00:53:01,287
Thank you. I'm not thirsty.

662
00:53:01,460 --> 00:53:04,395
It's okay. Breathe. Breathe. Deep breaths.

663
00:53:04,563 --> 00:53:06,963
Happy thoughts. Sing with me, okay?

664
00:53:33,993 --> 00:53:36,257
- You okay?
- Works every time.

665
00:53:36,529 --> 00:53:38,429
Dang, what's that all about?

666
00:53:38,697 --> 00:53:43,066
In two hours, I'm supposed to make
the most important speech of my life.

667
00:53:43,235 --> 00:53:44,463
It's been a rough day.

668
00:53:44,737 --> 00:53:48,264
Sweetheart, if it was all smooth sailing,
you know where we'd be?

669
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:51,739
- Bored to tears, that's what.
- Amen.

670
00:53:51,911 --> 00:53:54,971
Take this sister over here.
Come here, baby.

671
00:53:55,147 --> 00:53:58,913
Good. It's the curve balls
that make life interesting.

672
00:53:59,084 --> 00:54:00,642
Shows us what we're made of.

673
00:54:00,853 --> 00:54:03,981
And sometimes, if we're real lucky...

674
00:54:04,156 --> 00:54:08,115
...there's a blessing waiting for us
at the end of that wrong turn.

675
00:54:08,327 --> 00:54:11,125
Well, what if there's been
about 50 wrong turns?

676
00:54:11,297 --> 00:54:14,027
That last wrong turn brought you
in here, didn't it?

677
00:54:14,199 --> 00:54:16,929
So prepare to be blessed.

678
00:54:17,102 --> 00:54:21,038
Mickey. Bring me my toolbox.
We got some major bling to do.

679
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:25,435
- Who's Major Bling?
- Honey, this is Big Shirl's House of Bling.

680
00:54:25,678 --> 00:54:29,136
This is where the bling is born.
This is where bling lives.

681
00:54:29,315 --> 00:54:31,283
You got nothing to worry about.

682
00:54:39,625 --> 00:54:43,652
Just so we're clear,
I'd like a more corporate bling.

683
00:55:09,888 --> 00:55:13,085
Boy, you is filthy.
What am I gonna do with you?

684
00:55:30,909 --> 00:55:34,845
Boyfriend. Well, you girlfriend now.

685
00:55:48,127 --> 00:55:51,358
New York Knicks, baby! New York Knicks!

686
00:56:07,079 --> 00:56:09,570
- You look so hot.
- I feel hot.

687
00:56:09,748 --> 00:56:11,943
Sisters got some sister in them!

688
00:56:12,484 --> 00:56:14,281
Y'all good to go.

689
00:56:34,106 --> 00:56:36,370
- Thank you so much.
- Oh, you're welcome.

690
00:56:36,542 --> 00:56:39,511
- I promise we'll pay you back.
- Honey, it's on the house.

691
00:56:39,678 --> 00:56:40,906
- Thank you.
- Bye-bye.

692
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:42,308
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

693
00:56:42,481 --> 00:56:44,608
- All right.
- I think I can pull this off.

694
00:56:44,783 --> 00:56:47,843
Hello? Oh, it's for you.

695
00:56:48,053 --> 00:56:49,418
Hello? Jane Ryan speaking.

696
00:56:49,588 --> 00:56:51,818
I have your boyfriend.

697
00:56:52,091 --> 00:56:55,527
- I don't have a boyfriend.
- Then I have your sister's boyfriend.

698
00:56:55,794 --> 00:56:58,285
My sister doesn't
have a boyfriend, either.

699
00:56:58,464 --> 00:57:01,865
Okay, look. Whatever.
I'm through with being Mr. Softy.

700
00:57:02,101 --> 00:57:06,003
You meet me in Times Square
at corner of 47th and Broadway...

701
00:57:06,171 --> 00:57:10,039
...in 20 minutes,
or else I will burn your book.

702
00:57:10,576 --> 00:57:11,838
He's gonna burn my book.

703
00:57:12,010 --> 00:57:14,808
He's not gonna burn your book.
That's censorship.

704
00:57:17,249 --> 00:57:19,479
- We have to go.
- Well, let's go.

705
00:57:19,651 --> 00:57:21,141
We need a ride, Big Shirl.

706
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:23,185
- Mickey, get your cab.
- Not now, Ma.

707
00:57:23,355 --> 00:57:24,947
- Around the corner.
- Thank you!

708
00:57:25,124 --> 00:57:28,890
- Be careful. All right. See you.
- Roxanne Ryan. Cease and desist!

709
00:57:30,729 --> 00:57:32,128
Who's that cracker?

710
00:57:34,933 --> 00:57:36,992
I don't know.
He ain't from around here.

711
00:57:37,669 --> 00:57:39,500
Hurry, get in the car!

712
00:57:40,405 --> 00:57:42,202
Okay.

713
00:57:44,543 --> 00:57:46,408
Jane, start the car.

714
00:57:46,578 --> 00:57:49,138
I'm not exactly a strong driver.

715
00:57:53,018 --> 00:57:55,179
Step out of the car, Ryan. It's all over.

716
00:57:55,354 --> 00:57:58,414
- What do I do?
- Brake, left. Gas, right. Go!

717
00:58:05,697 --> 00:58:07,255
Watch out for the guy!

718
00:58:07,432 --> 00:58:08,797
- Slow down!
- Sorry!

719
00:58:09,568 --> 00:58:11,399
- Braking. Red.
- I know.

720
00:58:11,570 --> 00:58:12,901
Stop!

721
00:58:19,378 --> 00:58:22,939
Nassau County Department of Truancy.
I'm taking over your vehicle.

722
00:58:24,983 --> 00:58:26,678
- Okey-dokey.
- What fun.

723
00:58:26,919 --> 00:58:29,114
Tim Brooger. My wife, Steffi.

724
00:58:29,288 --> 00:58:31,950
- Pleased to meet you.
- Buckle up. Could be bumpy.

725
00:58:40,532 --> 00:58:43,433
How you got your driver's license
is beyond me.

726
00:58:44,102 --> 00:58:48,061
You didn't? You failed your driver's test?
That's incredible.

727
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:53,234
I got 100 percent on the written.
I just didn't quite pass the driving part.

728
00:58:54,413 --> 00:58:57,041
- Are we gonna be in a car chase?
- Don't tell me.

729
00:58:57,216 --> 00:59:00,014
- We've never been in a car chase.
- No, sir. Not one.

730
00:59:00,185 --> 00:59:03,586
- Seen them on TV.
- I think New York has the best car chases.

731
00:59:03,755 --> 00:59:06,417
- Oh, shoot...
- Small favor, Clem. Put a sock in it.

732
00:59:06,592 --> 00:59:08,560
Done, sir.

733
00:59:08,727 --> 00:59:11,594
- Where is he? Is he behind us?
- Yeah.

734
00:59:15,067 --> 00:59:19,026
We drove all the way from Minnetonka,
Minnesota just to see New York City.

735
00:59:19,204 --> 00:59:21,035
The Big Apple.

736
00:59:21,206 --> 00:59:25,870
- They say it's the city that never sleeps.
- I think it will now that you've hit town.

737
00:59:27,112 --> 00:59:29,637
- Red light, red light!
- I know!

738
00:59:30,015 --> 00:59:31,346
Red!

739
00:59:32,851 --> 00:59:35,183
I read the rule book.
I know what red means.

740
00:59:35,721 --> 00:59:38,690
Hi. I need to go to 112th...

741
00:59:39,524 --> 00:59:41,424
Go! Floor it!

742
00:59:43,228 --> 00:59:45,287
- Oh, God!
- What are you doing here?

743
00:59:46,131 --> 00:59:48,326
God, that is so hot!

744
00:59:53,972 --> 00:59:56,167
Would you give me just a little air?

745
00:59:56,341 --> 00:59:59,538
- I can't do this.
- You can do this. Breathe.

746
01:00:01,446 --> 01:00:03,710
- I'm getting killed.
- Stop it.

747
01:00:06,118 --> 01:00:07,346
Whoopsy-daisy!

748
01:00:07,519 --> 01:00:10,545
- Can you drive a little bit faster?
- Do you want to drive?

749
01:00:10,722 --> 01:00:12,019
I'll drive!

750
01:00:12,824 --> 01:00:16,385
I don't know if this would be helpful,
but we do have a loudspeaker.

751
01:00:16,561 --> 01:00:21,089
Sure, we use that for campfire sing-alongs
with our church group.

752
01:00:22,034 --> 01:00:25,333
Testing. Testing, one, two.
Can this be heard?

753
01:00:25,504 --> 01:00:27,870
- Roxanne Ryan, this is the law.
- Go!

754
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:30,634
- Pull over. Give yourself up.
- I'm being abducted!

755
01:00:30,809 --> 01:00:34,301
You think I'm kidding. I'm not.
You're only making things worse.

756
01:00:34,479 --> 01:00:38,415
You'll be in detention the rest of your life.
So let's end this right now.

757
01:00:38,583 --> 01:00:40,551
- This is kind of fun.
- It's not fun!

758
01:00:40,719 --> 01:00:42,550
Where'd he go?

759
01:00:43,055 --> 01:00:44,352
I think we lost him.

760
01:00:45,590 --> 01:00:47,615
You might wanna look to your right.

761
01:00:47,826 --> 01:00:51,592
Okay, playtime's over, Ryan.
Let's put the toys away and go home.

762
01:00:51,863 --> 01:00:53,490
- Pull over!
- Turn right here.

763
01:00:57,035 --> 01:00:58,662
You're going the wrong way!

764
01:00:58,837 --> 01:01:02,170
- I thought you said right here.
- Times Square's the other right.

765
01:01:02,341 --> 01:01:03,706
I have it under control.

766
01:01:03,875 --> 01:01:06,309
Yeah, right. Then where are we going?

767
01:01:06,545 --> 01:01:08,012
What are you doing?

768
01:01:08,180 --> 01:01:12,116
Signaling. I know the rules.
Hang on, people.

769
01:01:12,284 --> 01:01:14,752
Why are we reversing?
It's a one-way street!

770
01:01:15,988 --> 01:01:19,515
- We're going the wrong way.
- No, but we're facing the right way.

771
01:01:19,691 --> 01:01:23,092
- You're mine now, Ryan.
- It's too tight. We're not gonna make it.

772
01:01:23,261 --> 01:01:25,752
- We'll make it.
- We're not gonna make it!

773
01:01:25,931 --> 01:01:29,628
- Who's the professional here, you or me?
- I wanna say you.

774
01:01:30,435 --> 01:01:31,925
Go!

775
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:36,439
Look, there's a gate!

776
01:01:42,214 --> 01:01:43,442
I'm sorry.

777
01:01:55,293 --> 01:01:58,387
- Take some of that.
- Are you trying to kill us?

778
01:01:59,598 --> 01:02:03,125
I just saved your life,
and you're criticizing me?

779
01:02:03,335 --> 01:02:06,099
- Welcome to my world.
- What's that supposed to mean?

780
01:02:06,271 --> 01:02:08,432
It means you're always
looking down on me.

781
01:02:08,607 --> 01:02:10,507
- Looking down on you?
- Yeah.

782
01:02:10,675 --> 01:02:12,609
I've been looking out for you.

783
01:02:13,011 --> 01:02:15,912
Hey. Let me out of this car!

784
01:02:21,353 --> 01:02:23,321
Thanks for nothing!

785
01:02:23,488 --> 01:02:28,892
- How have you been looking out for me?
- Are you insane? That's all I ever do!

786
01:02:29,061 --> 01:02:32,895
The one day, the one time I want it
to be about me for a change...

787
01:02:33,065 --> 01:02:36,728
...I get inducted into the Roxy Ryan
School of Juvenile Delinquency.

788
01:02:36,902 --> 01:02:39,996
I've been trying to help you
from the minute we left.

789
01:02:40,172 --> 01:02:42,106
Lot of good that's done.

790
01:02:42,574 --> 01:02:45,509
Where are you going? I'm not finished.

791
01:02:45,677 --> 01:02:47,304
Yeah, well, I am.

792
01:02:47,979 --> 01:02:51,380
Why don't you run along and have fun.
That's what you're good at.

793
01:02:51,550 --> 01:02:55,987
As opposed to you, which is walking away
whenever we have a real conversation?

794
01:02:56,221 --> 01:02:58,917
I don't have time for a real conversation.

795
01:02:59,124 --> 01:03:02,150
- I'm too busy taking care of things.
- So who asked you to?

796
01:03:02,327 --> 01:03:06,821
You did. The minute you stopped taking
responsibility for anything since Mom died.

797
01:03:06,998 --> 01:03:09,489
That doesn't mean you get
to be her replacement.

798
01:03:12,504 --> 01:03:14,768
You know what I miss most about Mom?

799
01:03:15,073 --> 01:03:17,803
Is that she loved that we were different.

800
01:03:18,009 --> 01:03:21,308
And you punish me for it.

801
01:03:22,180 --> 01:03:24,307
From the day Mom died...

802
01:03:24,483 --> 01:03:27,509
...you've done nothing but push me
out of your life.

803
01:03:27,719 --> 01:03:30,586
- I have not.
- Oh, come on, Jane.

804
01:03:31,189 --> 01:03:35,990
The biggest day of your academic career,
and you didn't even bother to invite me.

805
01:03:37,662 --> 01:03:41,496
Well, forgive me for wanting the day
to be about me for a change.

806
01:03:42,167 --> 01:03:45,694
I make honor roll, Dad doesn't notice
because you're in detention.

807
01:03:46,004 --> 01:03:50,168
I'm captain of the cheerleading squad,
and Dad can't come to one game.

808
01:03:50,475 --> 01:03:54,912
One game, because he's busy going
to your parent/counselor meetings.

809
01:03:56,381 --> 01:03:59,248
You wanna know why I want
this fellowship abroad?

810
01:03:59,518 --> 01:04:02,351
It's because it's 3000 miles
away from you.

811
01:04:08,827 --> 01:04:11,193
Well, I really hope you get it, then.

812
01:05:51,396 --> 01:05:52,624
Roxy.

813
01:06:04,442 --> 01:06:08,344
Don't you worry. I'm not going to let
the mean little man hurt you.

814
01:06:09,147 --> 01:06:11,980
Hey, I don't know who you are
or what your game is...

815
01:06:12,150 --> 01:06:15,313
...but you've caused me a great deal
of inconvenience today.

816
01:06:15,487 --> 01:06:18,320
Not to mention, I am this close
to missing my speech.

817
01:06:18,490 --> 01:06:20,583
So let's have it. Let's have it.

818
01:06:21,493 --> 01:06:22,926
You finished?

819
01:06:25,397 --> 01:06:29,390
Ancient Chinese proverb:
You snooze, you lose.

820
01:06:29,567 --> 01:06:32,866
- Anyone, help!
- Let's take her to Ma.

821
01:06:47,819 --> 01:06:49,684
Perfect timing.

822
01:06:50,021 --> 01:06:51,249
Hello!

823
01:06:51,423 --> 01:06:53,220
Help!

824
01:06:53,391 --> 01:06:54,619
Help!

825
01:06:54,959 --> 01:06:56,517
- Help me!
- Hello?

826
01:06:56,695 --> 01:06:58,390
Roxy?

827
01:06:58,563 --> 01:07:00,224
- Trey?
- Yeah.

828
01:07:00,398 --> 01:07:04,129
- What are you doing in there?
- Can we talk after you open the trunk?

829
01:07:05,603 --> 01:07:08,470
- Thanks.
- Are you okay? What happened?

830
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:13,475
I'm coming to find you, next thing I know,
this limo guy just shoves me in there.

831
01:07:13,645 --> 01:07:16,136
Just when you think the day
can't get any worse.

832
01:07:20,518 --> 01:07:23,453
- You okay?
- I just got in a huge fight with my sister.

833
01:07:23,621 --> 01:07:27,284
She was gonna give a speech today.
Now she won't win the fellowship...

834
01:07:27,459 --> 01:07:31,486
...because there's no way she's getting
there on time, and it's all my fault.

835
01:07:32,530 --> 01:07:34,691
You sure about that?

836
01:07:40,038 --> 01:07:43,940
- Do you wanna take a field trip right now?
- Yeah.

837
01:07:44,209 --> 01:07:45,938
- Come on.
- Okay.

838
01:07:46,111 --> 01:07:47,806
Taxi!

839
01:07:52,417 --> 01:07:57,184
Now, it's just you and me.

840
01:07:57,355 --> 01:08:01,416
All alone. No excuses.

841
01:08:04,329 --> 01:08:06,593
Come on. Drink this.

842
01:08:06,765 --> 01:08:09,029
Drink this, and then the chip
will come out.

843
01:08:09,834 --> 01:08:13,361
This goes in here, chip come out here.

844
01:08:13,905 --> 01:08:15,930
I'm not kidding around. Drink it.

845
01:08:16,608 --> 01:08:18,098
See?

846
01:08:18,743 --> 01:08:22,338
Like that. Hey, that's pretty good.

847
01:08:24,682 --> 01:08:26,047
Come on.

848
01:08:27,752 --> 01:08:30,050
This movie isn't out yet.

849
01:08:32,123 --> 01:08:34,114
Neither is this CD.

850
01:08:34,726 --> 01:08:37,456
So that's what these guys are up to.

851
01:08:38,296 --> 01:08:42,892
Just listen to me. Give me that chip.
You don't want me to use this, do you?

852
01:08:43,067 --> 01:08:45,797
I don't even know what this is.

853
01:08:45,970 --> 01:08:48,063
But it's not gonna be pleasant.

854
01:08:48,606 --> 01:08:50,631
Now, give me the chip!

855
01:08:50,809 --> 01:08:52,970
Look into my eyes.

856
01:08:53,478 --> 01:08:56,038
I'm torturing you.

857
01:08:56,414 --> 01:08:58,245
It's unbearable!

858
01:08:58,416 --> 01:09:02,250
Bennie! This is your idea of torture?

859
01:09:02,587 --> 01:09:04,521
It's pathetic!

860
01:09:04,689 --> 01:09:06,953
We do it my way.

861
01:09:07,358 --> 01:09:09,121
Cats have nine lives.

862
01:09:09,794 --> 01:09:13,252
I wonder if little doggy does.

863
01:09:17,202 --> 01:09:19,898
Okay. I hope they haven't started.

864
01:09:20,071 --> 01:09:21,800
I can't run in these heels.

865
01:09:21,973 --> 01:09:25,170
The increase and/or decrease
in a nation's productivity...

866
01:09:25,343 --> 01:09:27,402
...or other such political aggregate...

867
01:09:27,579 --> 01:09:30,878
...can be regarded as the penultimate
indicator of a nation...

868
01:09:33,284 --> 01:09:37,050
Go see what she's doing.
Make her stop! Go.

869
01:09:37,222 --> 01:09:40,089
Cut it out in there! You make a mess,
you clean it up.

870
01:09:45,730 --> 01:09:46,890
Sorry!

871
01:09:48,132 --> 01:09:50,066
- He bit me!
- Get it off of me!

872
01:09:50,235 --> 01:09:52,066
Come on, Reinaldo. Come on!

873
01:09:52,737 --> 01:09:54,568
Come on.

874
01:10:06,284 --> 01:10:08,775
- Hey, stranger.
- Would you like to save my life?

875
01:10:08,953 --> 01:10:12,081
- I have 28 minutes to go 111 blocks.
- I could do that.

876
01:10:12,257 --> 01:10:15,784
- Where'd they go?
- Bennie, where are they? Let's go!

877
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:18,053
- Okay.
- Hold on.

878
01:10:23,167 --> 01:10:24,395
Hold on, okay?

879
01:10:27,872 --> 01:10:29,339
- You all right?
- Yeah.

880
01:10:40,685 --> 01:10:42,243
This is it.

881
01:10:44,923 --> 01:10:46,788
I don't see her.

882
01:10:47,825 --> 01:10:49,588
Jane Ryan?

883
01:10:50,728 --> 01:10:53,993
- Yeah?
- You're late. You're on next.

884
01:10:54,999 --> 01:10:57,593
- Are you sure you know what you're doing?
- Look...

885
01:10:57,769 --> 01:11:00,431
...I got her into this mess,
I have to get her out.

886
01:11:00,705 --> 01:11:04,698
Plus, how hard could it be reading
a bunch of note cards?

887
01:11:04,876 --> 01:11:06,844
Just go with me on this one.

888
01:11:07,011 --> 01:11:09,775
Okay, yeah. You're gonna do great.

889
01:11:20,992 --> 01:11:25,258
- All right. See you out there. Good luck.
- Thanks.

890
01:11:32,804 --> 01:11:36,296
Nice blazer, Muffie.

891
01:11:40,378 --> 01:11:41,868
Oh, gridlock!

892
01:11:42,046 --> 01:11:44,310
- Do you have a horn?
- We'll take a shortcut.

893
01:11:45,416 --> 01:11:47,281
Hey, what are you doing?

894
01:11:47,452 --> 01:11:49,477
Sorry.

895
01:11:49,988 --> 01:11:51,216
Excuse us.

896
01:11:52,657 --> 01:11:54,522
- Sorry.
- What's the matter with you?

897
01:11:56,260 --> 01:11:59,855
In this instance, we must defer to the
famed economist, Adam Smith...

898
01:12:00,398 --> 01:12:03,128
...who laid the foundation of a free market.

899
01:12:07,839 --> 01:12:09,534
Mother.

900
01:12:09,974 --> 01:12:11,373
What are you doing here?

901
01:12:12,810 --> 01:12:16,871
I'm honorary chair of the McGill Fellowship.
What are you doing here?

902
01:12:18,116 --> 01:12:21,677
- I wanted to see you present the award.
- Well, that's very sweet.

903
01:12:21,853 --> 01:12:25,186
Our last finalist is from Long Island
and has a 4.2 GPA.

904
01:12:25,423 --> 01:12:29,484
She's student-body president
and captain of her cheerleading squad.

905
01:12:29,661 --> 01:12:32,391
Please welcome Jane Ryan.

906
01:12:43,775 --> 01:12:45,242
Keep it together. It's okay.

907
01:12:56,921 --> 01:12:58,183
Oh, my God.

908
01:13:00,191 --> 01:13:02,022
You may proceed...

909
01:13:02,193 --> 01:13:04,627
...Miss Ryan.

910
01:13:08,700 --> 01:13:11,635
- Please.
- Right.

911
01:13:14,272 --> 01:13:16,069
Oh, man.

912
01:13:21,279 --> 01:13:22,541
Well...

913
01:13:22,947 --> 01:13:27,145
...as many of you all know...

914
01:13:27,318 --> 01:13:29,513
...the economy is...

915
01:13:29,687 --> 01:13:33,054
...very, very important to all of us.

916
01:13:34,092 --> 01:13:36,322
Take the word "economy."

917
01:13:37,595 --> 01:13:42,760
You have "eco,"
which stands for environment.

918
01:13:43,034 --> 01:13:46,003
You know, which we're all
real big supporters of.

919
01:13:47,205 --> 01:13:50,663
And we have "onomy," which...

920
01:13:51,309 --> 01:13:53,140
...is pig Latin for "money."

921
01:13:55,179 --> 01:13:57,670
Money, economy.

922
01:13:58,049 --> 01:13:59,277
Right.

923
01:14:14,532 --> 01:14:17,262
- Go, go, go. Good luck.
- Okay.

924
01:14:18,669 --> 01:14:21,797
- Are you coming? Come on.
- Yeah.

925
01:14:30,715 --> 01:14:32,649
Well...

926
01:14:32,817 --> 01:14:34,944
...for as the...

927
01:14:35,119 --> 01:14:40,716
...the famous,
famous Canadian professor...

928
01:14:40,892 --> 01:14:43,452
...Avril Lavigne...

929
01:14:43,628 --> 01:14:46,062
...stein once said, and I quote:

930
01:14:47,231 --> 01:14:50,223
"Why'd you have to go and make things
so complicated?

931
01:14:51,736 --> 01:14:56,173
I see the way you're acting, like you're
somebody else, gets me frustrated.

932
01:14:56,941 --> 01:14:59,967
Life's like this:
You fall, and you crawl...

933
01:15:00,144 --> 01:15:03,705
...and you break, and you take
what you can get.

934
01:15:03,881 --> 01:15:05,542
You turn it into honesty...

935
01:15:05,716 --> 01:15:09,015
...and promise me I'm never
gonna find you fake it.

936
01:15:10,321 --> 01:15:13,347
No. No.

937
01:15:14,158 --> 01:15:15,557
No."

938
01:15:23,835 --> 01:15:26,065
- Oh, thank God.
- Roxy?

939
01:15:26,237 --> 01:15:30,003
Well, ladies and gentlemen,
that's all the time I have for... So...

940
01:15:30,174 --> 01:15:33,439
...will the real Jane Ryan please stand up?

941
01:15:38,216 --> 01:15:40,047
Reinaldo!

942
01:15:40,218 --> 01:15:42,083
Trey, what is going on?

943
01:15:43,855 --> 01:15:46,085
Apparently, the dog groomer delivers.

944
01:15:48,359 --> 01:15:49,986
Are you okay?

945
01:15:50,161 --> 01:15:52,254
What are you doing here?

946
01:15:52,430 --> 01:15:55,456
Well, aside from completely
humiliating myself...

947
01:15:55,633 --> 01:15:58,124
I'm sorry. I wanted to read
the speech for you...

948
01:15:58,302 --> 01:16:02,534
No. Please. Here. I can take it from here.

949
01:16:03,174 --> 01:16:04,766
Are you sure?

950
01:16:06,344 --> 01:16:09,836
Ladies and gentlemen,
my name is Jane Ryan.

951
01:16:12,884 --> 01:16:14,613
Roxy, behind you!

952
01:16:14,785 --> 01:16:16,810
Nassau County Department of Truancy.

953
01:16:16,988 --> 01:16:19,456
This girl, Roxanne Ryan,
is now in my custody.

954
01:16:19,624 --> 01:16:23,958
And that girl, Jane Ryan, is an accomplice
in her criminal activities!

955
01:16:24,128 --> 01:16:26,153
And she stole my stupid ugly mutt too.

956
01:16:26,330 --> 01:16:29,731
I don't know what is going on here,
but that "mutt" is mine.

957
01:16:29,901 --> 01:16:31,129
Come here, ugly doggy.

958
01:16:31,302 --> 01:16:34,931
- And I order you to give him back.
- Yeah, you and what army, lady?

959
01:16:37,275 --> 01:16:39,038
- Officer!
- Me?

960
01:16:39,210 --> 01:16:41,041
Arrest that man!

961
01:16:42,546 --> 01:16:43,808
Yes, ma'am.

962
01:16:43,981 --> 01:16:45,471
Oh, my baby.

963
01:16:46,550 --> 01:16:48,950
Fly.

964
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:50,382
Every time.

965
01:16:50,688 --> 01:16:54,351
- Hey, that's my mom's dog!
- I think it started.

966
01:16:56,661 --> 01:16:58,788
It doesn't look like Cats.

967
01:17:00,531 --> 01:17:01,896
Everybody, freeze.

968
01:17:05,002 --> 01:17:10,030
Someone please explain to me
what is going on.

969
01:17:11,309 --> 01:17:14,176
I think I can do that.

970
01:17:14,345 --> 01:17:16,336
See, this guy over here...

971
01:17:16,781 --> 01:17:19,443
...that man who thinks he's Chinese...
You're not.

972
01:17:19,750 --> 01:17:24,380
- And his mother are criminals dealing
in pirated music, movies...

973
01:17:24,588 --> 01:17:28,251
...and probably Gucci handbags.
I don't know.

974
01:17:28,659 --> 01:17:30,786
- Probably.
- The guy with the eyebrows.

975
01:17:30,962 --> 01:17:36,025
- We know him. He drove us over here.
- He didn't tell us he was in the play.

976
01:17:36,200 --> 01:17:38,668
A cop and an actor.

977
01:17:38,836 --> 01:17:41,737
And how, may I ask, did you two
get involved in this?

978
01:17:41,906 --> 01:17:45,467
- I think I can shed some light on that.
- You see...

979
01:17:45,643 --> 01:17:51,081
...senator, it was this crime fighter here,
Officer Lomax...

980
01:17:51,248 --> 01:17:56,743
...who tracked down the Bang family
and wouldn't rest until justice was served.

981
01:17:56,921 --> 01:18:02,826
So really, we're just witnesses
to his sting operation.

982
01:18:03,127 --> 01:18:06,927
- Yeah! What she said.
- Is that true, Officer Lomax?

983
01:18:07,131 --> 01:18:09,895
Did you engineer this collar?

984
01:18:11,335 --> 01:18:15,169
Well, I don't want to gloat, senator,
but I think "mastermind"...

985
01:18:15,339 --> 01:18:18,536
...might be a more appropriate
choice of words.

986
01:18:18,709 --> 01:18:19,971
I love you.

987
01:18:23,047 --> 01:18:24,878
Just a second.

988
01:18:25,049 --> 01:18:28,951
I assume that wasn't the speech
you intended to give this afternoon.

989
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:31,782
- Not exactly, but...
- No. No. It wasn't.

990
01:18:31,956 --> 01:18:34,584
But you should have heard the real one.

991
01:18:34,792 --> 01:18:39,252
It was amazing, and I know this, because
I heard her practice it 1000 times.

992
01:18:39,430 --> 01:18:42,399
And trust me, she would have won
this thing hands down.

993
01:18:42,833 --> 01:18:46,234
I'm sorry today didn't work out
the way you planned.

994
01:18:46,771 --> 01:18:53,040
See, I thought today was about the speech,
the fellowship...

995
01:18:53,210 --> 01:18:55,576
...my academic future.

996
01:18:56,347 --> 01:19:00,875
But instead, it was about something
much more important.

997
01:19:02,186 --> 01:19:06,748
It just took me a few wrong turns
to see it.

998
01:19:12,997 --> 01:19:17,024
- That was something else, wasn't it?
- Honey, I loved it. I loved it!

999
01:19:17,201 --> 01:19:19,897
Yes. You gotta... Come on.

1000
01:19:20,071 --> 01:19:23,234
Gotta give it up for the Cats!

1001
01:19:24,708 --> 01:19:26,642
Who let the cats out?

1002
01:19:26,811 --> 01:19:28,711
Get your hands where I can see them.

1003
01:19:28,879 --> 01:19:31,541
- Who let the cats out?
- You're not even a real cop.

1004
01:19:31,715 --> 01:19:33,307
Zip it, Odd Job.

1005
01:19:33,484 --> 01:19:36,214
Thanks to you, that's all gonna change.

1006
01:19:40,858 --> 01:19:42,120
Let me do it.

1007
01:19:47,731 --> 01:19:49,824
- So you're not mad?
- Are you kidding?

1008
01:19:50,935 --> 01:19:53,426
I can't believe what you did for me today.

1009
01:19:53,604 --> 01:19:56,164
- Listen...
- I want to apologize...

1010
01:19:56,340 --> 01:19:59,104
...for saying the things I said earlier.
It's just...

1011
01:19:59,276 --> 01:20:02,268
...I was having a meltdown.
Everything was going wrong.

1012
01:20:02,513 --> 01:20:05,641
That's because every time I tried to fix it,
it got worse.

1013
01:20:05,816 --> 01:20:07,750
The point is...

1014
01:20:08,719 --> 01:20:13,247
...we haven't spent the day together
in a really long time...

1015
01:20:14,291 --> 01:20:16,418
...and I've really missed you.

1016
01:20:18,095 --> 01:20:20,154
I've missed you too.

1017
01:20:21,765 --> 01:20:25,792
And I'm so, so sorry
if I ever made you feel...

1018
01:20:25,970 --> 01:20:29,531
...like you had to take Mom's place.

1019
01:20:30,608 --> 01:20:32,803
She would have been really proud.

1020
01:20:33,310 --> 01:20:35,335
Both of us.

1021
01:20:53,998 --> 01:20:56,466
It was really great bumping
into you today.

1022
01:20:57,301 --> 01:20:59,769
Maybe we could bump again.

1023
01:21:01,438 --> 01:21:04,066
Did I just say that?

1024
01:21:04,275 --> 01:21:05,503
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1025
01:21:05,676 --> 01:21:07,371
And I'm glad you did.

1026
01:21:08,312 --> 01:21:12,578
- So how about you just give me a call?
- Okay.

1027
01:21:12,750 --> 01:21:14,547
Yeah.

1028
01:21:15,686 --> 01:21:17,551
Jane Ryan?

1029
01:21:19,356 --> 01:21:20,948
Bye.

1030
01:21:21,492 --> 01:21:22,720
Bye.

1031
01:21:22,893 --> 01:21:26,659
Allow me to introduce myself.
My name is Hudson McGill.

1032
01:21:28,132 --> 01:21:31,499
Listen, I am so sorry about everything
that happened today...

1033
01:21:31,669 --> 01:21:32,897
You know what?

1034
01:21:33,070 --> 01:21:36,801
I think you handled yourself really well
today, considering everything.

1035
01:21:37,775 --> 01:21:40,403
The McGill Foundation
would be really honored...

1036
01:21:40,578 --> 01:21:44,708
...if you would represent us
at Oxford University next year.

1037
01:21:46,517 --> 01:21:48,041
But...

1038
01:21:48,219 --> 01:21:51,416
- I don't understand.
- I found these.

1039
01:21:51,922 --> 01:21:55,119
This would have been an amazing speech.

1040
01:21:55,593 --> 01:21:57,925
It's not just that you wanted to win...

1041
01:21:58,095 --> 01:22:01,622
...it's that you absolutely refused to fail.

1042
01:22:01,799 --> 01:22:03,630
And you didn't.

1043
01:22:03,801 --> 01:22:07,828
You deserve this fellowship, Jane.
You really do.

1044
01:22:08,005 --> 01:22:12,567
- Congratulations and good luck.
- Thank you.

1045
01:22:16,780 --> 01:22:20,739
- Can you believe it?
- I'm so happy.

1046
01:22:22,486 --> 01:22:24,147
I don't...

1047
01:22:24,688 --> 01:22:28,419
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.

1048
01:22:31,662 --> 01:22:34,859
One, two, three, four!

1049
01:23:06,397 --> 01:23:08,331
- Hey.
- Hi.

1050
01:23:08,899 --> 01:23:11,868
So have you given any thought
to visiting me in London?

1051
01:23:12,202 --> 01:23:15,171
Yeah. Yeah, I'm not gonna
be able to visit you.

1052
01:23:15,339 --> 01:23:18,866
It's not gonna work out for me. Sorry.

1053
01:23:19,043 --> 01:23:22,604
It's okay. I mean, your whole life's here.
I get it.

1054
01:23:22,780 --> 01:23:28,047
Jane, I'm playing. I'm moving. I'm actually
transferring schools there next year.

1055
01:23:28,218 --> 01:23:30,686
Really? Seriously?

1056
01:23:30,854 --> 01:23:32,515
- Are you excited?
- Yeah.

1057
01:23:36,727 --> 01:23:38,786
I've got this great idea for the video.

1058
01:23:38,962 --> 01:23:41,897
It's, like, Roxy, and she's dressed
as a cucumber, and...

1059
01:23:42,566 --> 01:23:47,230
Well, maybe I should just be happy that I'm
going to London on tour with you guys...

1060
01:23:47,404 --> 01:23:50,430
...and keep these thoughts to myself.
- Agreed.

1061
01:23:55,713 --> 01:23:57,874
Open up! Police!

1062
01:23:58,048 --> 01:23:59,777
Cut it, guys. Cut it.

1063
01:24:15,999 --> 01:24:18,229
Sorry to break up the party here, kids.

1064
01:24:18,769 --> 01:24:23,797
But you see, I got this little VW Bug
parked out there in a loading zone.

1065
01:24:24,208 --> 01:24:29,475
License number 2 Quilted Laxative 4
Santa Kansas Limerick.

1066
01:24:31,081 --> 01:24:33,311
Where's Roxanne Ryan?

1067
01:24:33,484 --> 01:24:35,281
You've got to be kidding me.

1068
01:24:36,487 --> 01:24:37,977
I am.

1069
01:24:38,522 --> 01:24:42,356
I just stopped by to wish you
bon voyage...

1070
01:24:42,526 --> 01:24:44,653
...and maybe get an autograph.

1071
01:24:45,295 --> 01:24:48,355
Of course you may, Officer Lomax.

1072
01:24:52,770 --> 01:24:53,998
Thank you, ma'am.

1073
01:24:59,309 --> 01:25:04,679
Hey, lggy Pop, crank the juice on that half
stack, and let's hear what this band can do!

1074
01:25:04,882 --> 01:25:07,112
You heard him. Let's roll the guitars.

1075
01:25:07,851 --> 01:25:09,785
Nice work, son.

1076
01:30:44,054 --> 01:30:46,045
