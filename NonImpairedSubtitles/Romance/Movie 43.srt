1
00:00:58,124 --> 00:00:59,614
- Good. Are you on?
- Yeah, we're ready.

2
00:01:01,127 --> 00:01:03,129
My name is CalVin Cutler.

3
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:05,965
What you're about to witness
is the most badass,

4
00:01:05,965 --> 00:01:08,092
fucked-up thing you'll ever see.

5
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:10,259
We call this the "Bull's Eye."

6
00:01:11,471 --> 00:01:14,201
Oh, yeah.
Don't try this at home.

7
00:01:15,175 --> 00:01:18,235
You're good? You ready, buddy?
All right. Right, ready?

8
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:22,339
One... two... three!

9
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:27,086
Tell me we got it. Just...

10
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:32,225
Did we? No! No way, we got it!
No fucking way, dude!

11
00:01:32,225 --> 00:01:34,094
We got it! We got it! We got...
- Oh, shit!

12
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:36,392
Look at that! Look at that!
Dude. Bull's eye, bro!

13
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:41,301
Awesome!

14
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:43,963
We're putting it on You Tube!
Let's go! Yeah!

15
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:45,262
Dude, we got a view!

16
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:49,298
Yeah, buddy, that was us
when we uploaded it.

17
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:53,108
Well, then upload it again
so we can have two views.

18
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:55,176
I-I don't think that's how it works.

19
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:57,511
- Hit "refresh," dude.
- Oh, yeah.

20
00:02:01,187 --> 00:02:03,289
- No way.
- That can't be right.

21
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:04,591
- Do me a favor.
- I just refreshed it.

22
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:05,956
Let's see if it pulls up.

23
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:10,525
No way. Twenty-five thousand
views, man!

24
00:02:11,931 --> 00:02:13,159
Five hundred thousand!

25
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,227
- One million? Yes!
- You're too money!

26
00:02:16,369 --> 00:02:19,205
- I told you we're gonna be famous.
- We're gonna be famous and...

27
00:02:19,205 --> 00:02:21,196
April fools, suckers!

28
00:02:22,108 --> 00:02:26,146
I took the liberty of cloning You Tube
and hyper-inflating your Views.

29
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,545
...You... You little shit!

30
00:02:28,014 --> 00:02:30,550
Did you just try to hit me
through your computer screen?

31
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:31,651
Yeah, I did!

32
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:34,245
Why don't you come in here so
I can hit you like a real man, pussy!

33
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,312
Working on my science project.
Enjoy your page Views.

34
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:39,286
God, he's such a little spaz!

35
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:41,961
- We need revenge.
- We do.

36
00:02:41,961 --> 00:02:45,131
- We need to April fools prank him.
- Yeah!

37
00:02:45,131 --> 00:02:47,233
- Hit him where it hurts.
- Square in his balls.

38
00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:49,035
No! We gotta do
something better.

39
00:02:49,035 --> 00:02:52,163
We steal his computer
and load it full of viruses.

40
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:55,241
- Wait, where do we get viruses?
- Uh, duh! Porn sites.

41
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:58,210
Hy do you think my computer's
so slow? Lt's full of 'em.

42
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:01,214
Oh, okay, but how-how do we get
his laptop if it's in his room?

43
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:03,550
We can't just-just kick
in the door and steal it.

44
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:06,280
How do you lure a dragon
out of a lion's den?

45
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:07,319
I don't know.

46
00:03:08,254 --> 00:03:10,557
- You present him with a challenge.
- Challenge?

47
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:12,354
A challenge. Jus... Follow my lead.

48
00:03:13,059 --> 00:03:16,290
- Baxter! Baxter, my man!
- What?

49
00:03:16,963 --> 00:03:20,421
Uh, me and J.J., we have
this computer problem.

50
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:25,436
There's this movie on
the Internet and we can't find it.

51
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:27,073
Can you help us?

52
00:03:27,073 --> 00:03:29,337
You're trying to get back
at me for that prank, right?

53
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:33,479
No! Truce! Truce.
Seriously, we just, uh...

54
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:38,849
we need to find it, uh,
before the FBI takes it down.

55
00:03:39,285 --> 00:03:40,353
You said the FBI?

56
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:44,424
- Fucking FBI, the CIA...
- The CSI, NCIS...

57
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:46,492
I mean, this video is so illegal,

58
00:03:46,492 --> 00:03:49,188
it has been banned
by every country in the world.

59
00:03:49,295 --> 00:03:50,396
Including Amsterdam.

60
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:52,498
Where you could slap a cop
in the face with your penis,

61
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:53,897
and they'd say, "danka."

62
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:55,559
Amsterdam is not a country!

63
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:58,304
- Amsterdam's not a country?
- Since when?

64
00:03:58,304 --> 00:04:00,373
The shit's still banned there, dude.

65
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:03,240
Yeah. Think about it. They... lt's-
It's like it's the-the-the fucking...

66
00:04:03,676 --> 00:04:06,279
It's the most dangerous
film in the world.

67
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:07,541
- It is.
- What's it called?

68
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,286
Actually, you know what,
Baxter? You're right.

69
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:15,083
It was an April Fool's prank.

70
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,490
I'm sorry we brought you into this.

71
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:19,525
You know, you should probably just...

72
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:22,595
go on with your life and never
think about this again. Please.

73
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:23,619
Wait.

74
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:27,262
- What's so bad about it?
- You don't wanna know.

75
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:28,595
What's so bad about it?

76
00:04:30,136 --> 00:04:33,439
Hey, slim!
What's so bad about it?

77
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,236
- It can kill you.
- How?

78
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:38,311
Lt can make you shit out
your intestines.

79
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:40,280
It can make you bleed
out of your eyes.

80
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,048
You know, one guy saw it,

81
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:45,218
and he ran into a church, and
he just started humping the nuns.

82
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:47,220
That was a huge story
a few years back.

83
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,055
It can make you pull off
your own dick.

84
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:50,657
Okay, why would you
want to watch it...

85
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:52,258
if it can make you pull off
your own dick?

86
00:04:52,258 --> 00:04:53,282
Because...

87
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:57,987
if you can watch it all the way
through from the beginning to end,

88
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:02,128
you're rewarded beyond
your wildest dreams.

89
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:07,332
With money. And sex.
And women.

90
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:11,269
It's like that movie The Ring,
but with a good ending.

91
00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:14,277
- Yeah. And boobs.
- Lots of boobs.

92
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:16,982
So what's this movie called?

93
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:20,279
MoVie.

94
00:05:21,287 --> 00:05:23,414
- Forty-three.
- MoVie forty-three.

95
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:28,287
It's not on Zwoogle.

96
00:05:29,295 --> 00:05:31,627
Yeah, of course it's not
on Zwoogle. It's banned!

97
00:05:32,565 --> 00:05:35,234
Okay. Then I guess
we'll need to dig deeper.

98
00:05:35,234 --> 00:05:37,429
Visit some dark corners
of the Internet.

99
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:40,473
Mm, yeah, the dark
corners, dude.

100
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:42,270
Yeah, get in there.
We gotta find this thing.

101
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:45,378
I found a cloaked server
that houses banned videos.

102
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:48,414
Start out with the forty-third one
on the list. Sound good?

103
00:05:48,414 --> 00:05:51,050
Yes! Yeah, you guys keep
working on this.

104
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:54,587
I'm gonna go guard the door
for the uh, FBI,

105
00:05:54,587 --> 00:05:56,521
the CIA, and Mom.

106
00:05:57,457 --> 00:05:59,118
Look at this. Check it out.

107
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,322
Hey. Ooh! You look good.

108
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:05,665
Hope you're almost ready.
He's gonna be here any second.

109
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:08,468
I don't know why I'm doing this,
Pam. I don't trust Julie.

110
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:12,105
- I mean, what if this guy's a loser?
- He's not a loser.

111
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:13,973
He made senior partner at his law
firm by the time he was,

112
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:15,065
like, twenty-eight.

113
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,472
So all he cares about is
his career and money.

114
00:06:18,244 --> 00:06:21,514
Mm, not according to Julie. He's a
volunteer with the Special Olympics,

115
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:23,414
he's on the board of
the New York Philharmonic...

116
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:25,540
He's opening a new restaurant
with Derek Jeter!

117
00:06:25,985 --> 00:06:28,688
But he's probably got one of those
awkward character faces...

118
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:31,179
that sort of really has
to grow on you, right?

119
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:36,189
Mr. "Character Face" is on
the cover of Gotham Magazine.

120
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:39,397
- That's him?
- That's him.

121
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:43,391
Yeah.

122
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:48,408
And he's here. Go.

123
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:49,942
- Do I look okay?
- Gorgeous.

124
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:51,177
- You sure?
- Have fun!

125
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:52,303
Bye!

126
00:06:57,283 --> 00:06:58,651
- I mean, you gotta be kidding.
- Several of them.

127
00:06:58,651 --> 00:07:01,988
I'm telling you, don't knock
shopping on TV until you've tried it.

128
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:03,656
Beth, I think-I think you're
the first person I've ever met...

129
00:07:03,656 --> 00:07:05,024
who actually buys
stuff off television.

130
00:07:05,024 --> 00:07:06,150
- No! Come on!
- No, it's true.

131
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,428
Oh, well where do you think
I got this scarf?

132
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:11,264
And you know what?
I bet it's softer than yours.

133
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,166
Okay. See, that's where
I draw the line.

134
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:14,967
Do not start putting down the scarf.

135
00:07:14,967 --> 00:07:17,503
Here. Feel this. One-hundred
percent pashmina.

136
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:19,705
Well, at least that's what
the guy on the street told me.

137
00:07:19,705 --> 00:07:22,608
Come on, then. Wow, that is soft.
Well, you know, l...

138
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:25,338
Hey, Mr. H. Table's ready, sir.

139
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:26,536
Great.

140
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:28,412
- L'll take those.
- Thank you.

141
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:30,183
- Please.
- Our table's ready.

142
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:31,150
Thank you.

143
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,342
After you.

144
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:40,223
So, um, Carrie tells me you design
clothes for kids. No?

145
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,553
Yes. Clothes for kids. I design...

146
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:46,232
clothes... for kids. Kids clothes.

147
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:47,529
Awesome. Awesome.

148
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:51,593
So, if I see some kids looking weird
this summer, it may be your fault, huh?

149
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:54,964
I'm just joking. I'm just joking.

150
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:57,977
Your Russian Standard Vodka, sir.

151
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,535
Am I that predictable, Abby?

152
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:03,449
Eh... Yeah, you good with that? Or would
you prefer a glass of wine or?

153
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:07,408
No. No, I c-I could, use it.

154
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:08,579
Thank you.

155
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:14,182
So, here's to a, Here's to
a wonderful evening. Cheers.

156
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:17,257
Cheers.

157
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:23,425
Those Russians know something.

158
00:08:26,472 --> 00:08:29,464
This is... a nice place.

159
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:32,578
Oh, it's great. This pl...
Oh, you gotta check out the ceiling.

160
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:34,614
Those beams were taken out...

161
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:37,149
of this old Quaker meetinghouse
out in rural Pennsylvania.

162
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:41,586
I mean, look. It's all oak. Isn't
that something? Lt's gorgeous, huh?

163
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:43,623
Oh, wow, Jake. What's this?

164
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:48,661
Well, Mr. H, this is a vichyssoise
courtesy of Chef Billy.

165
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:50,563
Now, he heard that you guys
were coming in tonight,

166
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:53,266
so he's put together a special
four-course meal for you.

167
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:54,597
Lobster okay tonight?

168
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:57,103
That's okay with me
if it's okay with you,

169
00:08:57,103 --> 00:08:58,866
un-unless you wanna
check out the menu.

170
00:08:59,138 --> 00:09:01,440
Beth? Unless you wanna
check out the menu, or?

171
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,374
- No, that's sounds lovely.
- Right.

172
00:09:04,176 --> 00:09:05,177
Terrific.

173
00:09:05,177 --> 00:09:07,441
Please thank the chef.
Thank you.

174
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:09,273
Bon Appétit.

175
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,613
Oh, you've, got something on your...

176
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:20,624
Something on my neck? Leave it to me
to embarrass myself on a first date.

177
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:24,220
Here...

178
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:26,566
There? There? I got it?

179
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:30,136
A little bit... bit more on-on
the left b-ball... One.

180
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:33,037
Uh, left side. Of...
Dribbly bit. O

181
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:40,913
Thanks. I mean, no biggie. Trust me,
I've been through worse. I mean, as...

182
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:44,280
As a kid, I used to get made
fun of all the time.

183
00:09:44,383 --> 00:09:46,986
Was it, because of your...

184
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:49,589
My stutter. I-I used to have
a really bad stutter.

185
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:53,218
Actually took probably nine years of
speech therapy to get rid of it.

186
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:09,098
So, was there anything else they...
may have made fun of?

187
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,913
- I don't know.
- Anything at all?

188
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:17,016
Oh, yeah, some kids used to talk
a little smack about my neck.

189
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:19,075
- You know.
- Oh, thank God!

190
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:22,955
- What's up?
- I thought I was going crazy. L...

191
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:24,146
What?

192
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:28,628
I mean... not a big deal...
at all.

193
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:32,894
It's just, what is the story there?

194
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:38,437
Well, when I was six, I fell off my bike
and I landed on a sprinkler head...

195
00:10:38,437 --> 00:10:40,973
and they had to stitch me up
at the hospital.

196
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:43,407
See, it's, it's just a scar. Right?

197
00:10:43,943 --> 00:10:47,003
I mean, kids could be mean.
They used to call me Frankenstein.

198
00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:52,477
They're like,
"He's alive. He's alive!"

199
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:58,186
Well, I don't care, you know.
Kids make fun of everything, right?

200
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:02,359
Ls it just me or did it suddenly
get a little chilly in here?

201
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,189
I think it may be that vent there.

202
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:11,971
- Here we are.
- Man! Look at the size of those things.

203
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:14,974
Oh, Jake, buddy, would you mind
turning up the heat just a tad?

204
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:17,135
I think that, that vent's blowing
right on... Not a problem.

205
00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:19,011
Thank you.

206
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:20,312
And, uh, just let me go ahead and...

207
00:11:20,312 --> 00:11:22,648
- Sure.
- Get this out of your way here.

208
00:11:22,648 --> 00:11:24,138
Oh, God! Are you-Are you okay?

209
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:27,610
Lt's my stomach. There's...

210
00:11:29,955 --> 00:11:31,445
Just get my breath back, you know.

211
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:35,361
There he is! There's the stud!

212
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:36,988
Hey! Angie! Ray!

213
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:38,964
Hey, how the hell are you guys?
You're good?

214
00:11:38,964 --> 00:11:40,591
Apparently not as good as you.

215
00:11:40,966 --> 00:11:43,436
Hi, I'm Angie and this is
my husband Ray.

216
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:46,272
- Hi.
- This is my new friend, Beth.

217
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:48,441
She's slowly restoring
my faith in blind dates.

218
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:50,009
Well, kudos to you, Beth,

219
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:52,178
for getting this old workaholic
out of his office for once.

220
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:53,577
Come on. Come on, Ray.

221
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:56,944
Nice work!
You caught the big one!

222
00:11:57,016 --> 00:11:58,040
Did I?

223
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:00,920
But... Do you not notice the...

224
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:04,287
- Look how big little Evan's getting!
- Yeah. Little?

225
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:07,148
Yeah. He's growing like crazy.

226
00:12:08,694 --> 00:12:10,252
- No.
- Who's a big boy?

227
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:13,430
Who's a big boy, huh?

228
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:16,936
Wow, Ray, he's a monster. You got
yourself a little linebacker here.

229
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:19,305
A little linebacker that needs
to go to bed!

230
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:21,569
Okay. You're off to bed.
There you go.

231
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:25,478
- Fumble.
- Another pacifier down.

232
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:26,604
I got it.

233
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:29,642
Thanks, buddy. Thanks bud.

234
00:12:30,182 --> 00:12:31,484
Here, bud. Angie?

235
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:33,052
You guys look so cute.
I gotta take a picture.

236
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:34,041
Really?

237
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:37,056
- Angie, please.
- Hey, let-let the man eat, honey.

238
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:39,425
Come on, Ray. We have a picture
of our first date.

239
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,327
They should have a picture of theirs.

240
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:45,164
Come on, get your fanny over there
behind her and don't be shy.

241
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:48,501
- All right. Okay, okay. All right.
- Okay.

242
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:50,332
- I'm sorry about this.
- Get in close.

243
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:53,027
Beth, I'm gonna need
you to hold still.

244
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:55,074
Oh, God, they look so...

245
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:58,043
Get down! Get your face down
next to hers! Come on!

246
00:12:58,043 --> 00:13:00,204
Take it. Take it. Take it, take it,
take it, take it.

247
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:02,876
- So good!
- How's that?

248
00:13:04,016 --> 00:13:05,551
Now why don't you give
each other a little kiss?

249
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:07,052
Oh, come on.
Angie, we just met.

250
00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:09,088
Come on, let 'em eat!
Let the man eat!

251
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:10,923
- Come on! Just a little kiss.
- All right, all right.

252
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:13,325
We'll do one, one kiss
on the forehead.

253
00:13:13,325 --> 00:13:14,326
- One peck on the forehead.
- We don't need to.

254
00:13:14,326 --> 00:13:15,561
- Ready? Okay.
- We really don't.

255
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:16,926
We don't need...

256
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:22,292
The fuck, man! Keep looking.

257
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:27,300
Let's try the forty-second one.

258
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:28,940
Yeah, yeah, good idea.

259
00:13:33,345 --> 00:13:34,903
Boobs.

260
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:39,313
Pornography with viruses.

261
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:43,045
Yeah, Baxter, you're going down.

262
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:44,955
Keep looking.

263
00:13:52,097 --> 00:13:54,433
It's uh, roast Sumatra.
I grind the beans myself.

264
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:57,036
Hey, thanks again for dinner.
You really didn't haVe to do this.

265
00:13:57,036 --> 00:13:58,037
Oh, please.

266
00:13:58,037 --> 00:13:59,438
What kind of neighbors would we be...

267
00:13:59,438 --> 00:14:01,340
if we didn't have you over
for a welcome dinner?

268
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:04,977
Sean, Samantha was just saying
that they homeschool their son.

269
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:06,111
Oh, that is interesting.

270
00:14:06,111 --> 00:14:08,447
Well, we just think it's
the only way to make sure...

271
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:11,075
that he gets the best
education possible.

272
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,118
You should really consider
it for your kids.

273
00:14:13,118 --> 00:14:15,888
Hey, you know, Kevin's upstairs
doing his homework right now.

274
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:17,423
I'm sure he'd love to talk
to you guys about it.

275
00:14:17,423 --> 00:14:21,052
Wait. He... So you homeschool your son
but he still gets homework?

276
00:14:23,495 --> 00:14:26,098
Lt's very important to us
that Kevin has...

277
00:14:26,098 --> 00:14:29,124
a normal and complete
high school experience.

278
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:36,008
Written assignments are to be done in
black ink. Not green or blue or pink.

279
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:39,000
When are you gonna get that through
your thick skull, Mr. Morris?

280
00:14:39,945 --> 00:14:41,003
Lt's Miller.

281
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,141
That's a detention.

282
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:47,119
Move, move, move, move, move!
Pick it up! Pick it up!

283
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:49,314
Come on, girlfriend,
pick your knees up!

284
00:14:50,956 --> 00:14:52,458
Oh, I-I see. It's...

285
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:56,462
But don't you feel like maybe he's,
I don't know, missing out?

286
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:59,031
Yeah, high school is about more
than just classes and homework.

287
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:02,134
Absolutely. There's
the alienation, the loneliness.

288
00:15:02,134 --> 00:15:05,137
It should be the unhappiest
time in a boy's life.

289
00:15:05,137 --> 00:15:06,238
That's why we try to make sure...

290
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:09,308
that Kevin doesn't miss out
on any of those essential...

291
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:13,005
emotionally scarring experiences
that he'd get at a regular school.

292
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:16,181
Fag!

293
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:18,982
Faggot!

294
00:15:21,553 --> 00:15:24,021
You dropped your books, fuckface!

295
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:33,962
Jesus! Dad, what the fuck!

296
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:36,466
Whoa. You've got weird pubes.

297
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:40,594
Hey, guys! Come check out
this kid's weird pubes!

298
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:44,209
Still, it must be an awful lot
of work for you guys, though.

299
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:47,146
Oh, sure, there is.
But we love it.

300
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:49,682
I think we've put together
a pretty comprehensive plan...

301
00:15:49,682 --> 00:15:53,209
that provides Kevin with every
important adolescent experience.

302
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:55,250
You know, socializing
with other kids...

303
00:16:06,932 --> 00:16:09,059
Hey. Kevin, right?

304
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:12,063
Can I please come in?

305
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:15,441
Look, Debbie Clark's here,

306
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:18,342
the girl you asked out before.
It's gonna be awkward.

307
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:27,152
Sorry. No. Sorry, sorry.
No. Sorry. Okay, okay.

308
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:29,052
Mom. Mom, please no, wait.
Mom, just... lf l...

309
00:16:35,427 --> 00:16:37,224
Extracurricular activities.

310
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:39,888
What do you do?

311
00:16:40,632 --> 00:16:41,929
I suck.

312
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:43,393
What do you suck?

313
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:47,039
- Dicks.
- Louder!

314
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:49,575
- I suck dicks! I suck dicks!
- Like you mean it!

315
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:52,444
I suck dicks, I suck dicks,
I suck 'em all the time!

316
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:54,346
Lf you were a superhero,
what would your superpower be?

317
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:56,582
My superpower would be
sucking dicks!

318
00:16:56,582 --> 00:17:00,177
Dude. You have so much
poop on you right now.

319
00:17:02,054 --> 00:17:04,523
And of course the first kiss...

320
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:07,959
that should be the most awkward
moment in any boy's life.

321
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:16,165
Emily and Kara said
we should go all the way.

322
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:20,265
What do you think?

323
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:53,161
Um, do you have protection?

324
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:57,202
So, dude.

325
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:00,608
Don't tell Jeff or any
of those guys, but...

326
00:18:01,947 --> 00:18:03,505
I just wanted to say that...

327
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:07,915
if I did like guys...

328
00:18:10,155 --> 00:18:12,885
you'd totally be the kind
of guy that I'd like.

329
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:18,593
This is weird.

330
00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:28,435
I didn't mean any of that.

331
00:18:29,975 --> 00:18:31,169
Just talking, you know?

332
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:33,212
Wow.

333
00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:36,215
I don't think l'll ever forget
the first time Kevin told us that...

334
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:38,617
he wished he'd never been born.

335
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:41,916
- He was only twelve.
- Precocious kid.

336
00:18:42,054 --> 00:18:44,223
You know, studies show
that the average child...

337
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:46,592
doesn't express that kind of
self-loathing till they're fifteen.

338
00:18:46,592 --> 00:18:48,287
I bet.

339
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:51,218
Here he comes.

340
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:55,200
Hey, honey.
Meet the neighbors.

341
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,071
Kevin, this is Sean and Clare. They
moved into the house three doors down.

342
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:01,306
Oh, the Yeagers' old place. Great.

343
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:02,941
Yeah, I'm, um, I'm-I'm Kevin.

344
00:19:02,941 --> 00:19:05,034
Uh, pleased to meet you.
Welcome to the neighborhood.

345
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:07,635
- Nice to meet you, too.
- Thank you. That's so polite. That's...

346
00:19:08,413 --> 00:19:10,616
I'm heading out. A bunch of us are
gonna meet up at The Green.

347
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:12,140
Ooh, The Green.

348
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:14,620
And, uh, yes,
I finished my homework.

349
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:17,489
Oh, and Jen and I are gonna
catch a movie afterwards,

350
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:18,590
so I won't be home until late.

351
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:21,582
Oh, that's fine. Just make
sure you say hello from us.

352
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:25,520
Jen, my mom says hi.

353
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:28,255
Hello, Jen.

354
00:19:29,034 --> 00:19:32,197
Hello, Mrs. Miller.
I'm the pretty girl.

355
00:19:33,405 --> 00:19:34,565
She is.

356
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:39,006
- You guys have fun tonight. -
All right.

357
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:41,280
Nice meeting you!

358
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,305
So. Who wants cake?

359
00:19:44,249 --> 00:19:46,217
Creepy. Let's move on.

360
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:48,350
Keep searching, dude.

361
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:07,439
Hi.

362
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:09,908
- There.
- Oh, wow.

363
00:20:09,908 --> 00:20:12,103
Now it's a picnic.

364
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:14,680
Would you care for
a chocolate-covered strawberry?

365
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:18,377
Oh my gosh, sweetie.
Talk about romantic.

366
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:20,419
This is perfect!

367
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:23,422
Julie, we've been together
for over a year...

368
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:25,856
Sixteen months and two weeks.

369
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:32,457
And in that time, I've come to realize
that you mean everything to me.

370
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:35,457
Oh, Doug. You, too.

371
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:39,238
And there's something
I want to ask you.

372
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,399
There's something
I'd like to ask you.

373
00:20:42,307 --> 00:20:44,343
Okay, uh, you go first.

374
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:46,144
- No, you go first.
- No, you first.

375
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:47,304
No, you first.

376
00:20:47,646 --> 00:20:50,410
How about we say it
at the same time?

377
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:51,605
Okay.

378
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:55,613
- One, two...
- One, two.

379
00:20:55,988 --> 00:20:57,421
Will you poop on me?

380
00:20:59,157 --> 00:21:01,887
- What?
- Will you poop on me?

381
00:21:02,494 --> 00:21:03,859
What? What are you...

382
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:06,531
Wait, what did-
what did you say?

383
00:21:06,531 --> 00:21:09,668
L... I trust you. I feel like
you're my soul mate.

384
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:13,505
I want to give you this gift.
I want you to be my first.

385
00:21:13,505 --> 00:21:16,235
To poop...

386
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:17,933
On me. What?

387
00:21:18,677 --> 00:21:21,513
You don't want to?

388
00:21:21,513 --> 00:21:23,148
No, I-I mean...

389
00:21:23,148 --> 00:21:24,650
Are you not attracted
to me anymore?

390
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:27,319
Of course I'm attracted
to you, honey.

391
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:30,288
So will you? Poop on me?

392
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:37,360
Ah, man. You just hit
the fucking lottery, man.

393
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:42,434
You don't think it's a little weird
for wanting him to shit on her?

394
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:46,165
Slow down, man. Have some
respect for this guy, okay?

395
00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:48,173
She did not ask him to shit on her.

396
00:21:48,173 --> 00:21:49,574
Shitting is something
you do on a whore.

397
00:21:49,574 --> 00:21:50,942
- Right.
- Right?

398
00:21:50,942 --> 00:21:53,570
Pooping is a gift you give
to your soul mate.

399
00:21:54,446 --> 00:21:56,615
- 'Course.
- I never looked at it like that.

400
00:21:56,615 --> 00:21:59,551
So tell me, man, what's on the menu?
Before you do the big deed.

401
00:21:59,551 --> 00:22:02,076
I don't... I don't know.
Does it fucking matter?

402
00:22:02,387 --> 00:22:05,424
- Is she a vegetarian?
- No.

403
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:09,494
Boom! Big beef burrito, with
extra beans on that bad boy.

404
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:11,997
Put some salsa,
some guacamole for color.

405
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:14,599
When it come out of you, it's a
festival. You know what I'm saying?

406
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:17,502
You went the extra yard
for your lady. You hear me?

407
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:19,571
No, I'm doing something
classy, okay?

408
00:22:19,571 --> 00:22:23,302
I'm doing seared ahi tuna steaks,
a salad, and red wine.

409
00:22:23,442 --> 00:22:25,610
- No. No, no, no! Fuckin' no!
- Nice.

410
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:29,979
It's not about how fancy it goes in.
It's about how fancy it comes out.

411
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:33,985
Well... And believe me, Mexican
food makes a fuckin' mess.

412
00:22:33,985 --> 00:22:35,487
And don't mess with fuckin' salads.

413
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:37,656
You know what salad does?
Lt locks down your bowels.

414
00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:40,420
You don't want your bowels
all locked down, do you? No.

415
00:22:40,926 --> 00:22:43,128
Drinks are cool.
Have a few fuckin' drinks.

416
00:22:43,128 --> 00:22:44,663
- Makes you last longer.
- Last longer?

417
00:22:44,663 --> 00:22:47,532
You don't want to be Mr. Two Squeeze,
Thank-You Please, right?

418
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:50,268
- You really don't want to be that.
- Billy, goddamn, Billy.

419
00:22:50,268 --> 00:22:52,604
Why don't you go over there while
grown people are talking over here.

420
00:22:52,604 --> 00:22:54,506
Go over there and play with your
GI Joes or some shit, man.

421
00:22:54,506 --> 00:22:56,108
Yeah, l'll go over there.

422
00:22:56,108 --> 00:22:58,633
Lookit. Take my advice
on this one.

423
00:22:59,177 --> 00:23:02,647
You go out tonight and you
shit on a few skanks. Okay?

424
00:23:02,647 --> 00:23:04,349
Get it all out your system.

425
00:23:04,349 --> 00:23:09,218
Fuckin' tomorrow, you are
a one-poop man.

426
00:23:09,588 --> 00:23:10,919
Understand?

427
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:14,426
What the fuck is this?

428
00:23:14,426 --> 00:23:18,419
Viagra, brother.
Poop Viagra. Yeah.

429
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:21,600
- Just carry that on you?
- Yeah, I carry that shit around on me.

430
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,335
- At barbecues?
- You goddamn right.

431
00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:24,369
I got a meat problem.

432
00:23:24,369 --> 00:23:26,037
All your fuckin' meat,
I gotta clean that shit out.

433
00:23:26,037 --> 00:23:27,334
- Okay, yeah.
- Okay? Fine, then.

434
00:23:42,988 --> 00:23:45,183
- I'm ready, sweetie.
- Oh, fuck.

435
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:46,549
One second.

436
00:24:17,556 --> 00:24:20,389
I love her. Hey, I love her.

437
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:29,668
- Oh, oh! You look nice.
- Thank you.

438
00:24:29,668 --> 00:24:32,504
Okay. Let's go...

439
00:24:32,504 --> 00:24:35,405
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Honey.
What are you doing?

440
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:38,510
What am I doing? I'm...
You know what I'm doing.

441
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:39,911
I'm trying to, you know.

442
00:24:39,911 --> 00:24:44,939
Not yet, tiger. I wanna savor this.

443
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:47,141
Oh, okay. Well,
I kinda-I kinda got to, uh...

444
00:24:47,552 --> 00:24:50,851
No, no, no, no. Come here.
Come here and kiss me,

445
00:24:51,189 --> 00:24:55,023
and then you can give me
your special present.

446
00:24:57,562 --> 00:25:00,532
- Tell me how much you love me.
- Oh, I love you so much.

447
00:25:00,532 --> 00:25:02,901
- How much?
- I love you so much I'd kill a man.

448
00:25:02,901 --> 00:25:03,959
Can we do this, please?

449
00:25:06,605 --> 00:25:09,972
- I bought this special lavender lotion.
- Okay.

450
00:25:10,108 --> 00:25:13,211
- Why don't you get my neck ready.
- You want it on your neck?

451
00:25:13,211 --> 00:25:15,213
Why? Does that not work for you?

452
00:25:15,213 --> 00:25:17,238
Lt's fine, it's fine. Here we go.

453
00:25:23,922 --> 00:25:25,123
That's nice.

454
00:25:25,123 --> 00:25:27,591
Okay, okay. There we go.
Let's get it and...

455
00:25:30,395 --> 00:25:33,558
- No. No. Not yet.
- What?

456
00:25:33,932 --> 00:25:36,457
- No. Come here.
- What?

457
00:25:37,602 --> 00:25:40,935
- You're so excited.
- I know. I can't stand it.

458
00:25:43,508 --> 00:25:46,211
Gosh. Remember the day
that we met?

459
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:47,473
Yes.

460
00:25:47,612 --> 00:25:52,345
Did you ever think that someday
you'd be able to...

461
00:25:53,518 --> 00:25:56,121
- you know?
- Honestly, no. No, I didn't.

462
00:25:56,121 --> 00:25:58,180
Do you remember what
I was wearing that day?

463
00:25:59,624 --> 00:26:01,326
Baby, what was I wearing?

464
00:26:01,326 --> 00:26:03,328
- Do you remember what I was wearing?
- A yellow sun dress!

465
00:26:03,328 --> 00:26:05,319
Come on! Roll over and let me
shit on you, please!

466
00:26:06,598 --> 00:26:07,933
Excuse me?

467
00:26:07,933 --> 00:26:10,235
I'm sorry. Poop on you.
I meant poop on you.

468
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:12,070
Honey, I would never shit on you.

469
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,594
I would never shit on you. Honey?

470
00:26:13,939 --> 00:26:16,430
Come here. I love you! Fuck!

471
00:26:17,475 --> 00:26:18,965
Oh, I can't.

472
00:26:20,545 --> 00:26:22,342
Julie! Come back!

473
00:26:23,181 --> 00:26:26,480
Oh, baby, please! I love you!
I want you to marry you!

474
00:26:28,954 --> 00:26:30,615
Oh, my God! Doug, no!

475
00:26:33,892 --> 00:26:35,382
Oh, jeez!

476
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:40,056
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

477
00:26:40,966 --> 00:26:44,302
- Doug! Doug! Call a fucking ambulance!
- I'm on it!

478
00:26:44,302 --> 00:26:48,261
Hold on. Hold on, baby, okay?
Hold on. You're gonna make it.

479
00:26:49,474 --> 00:26:50,941
Oh, Julie, I love you.

480
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:53,343
I love you.

481
00:26:54,312 --> 00:26:57,110
All of this was for me?

482
00:26:58,249 --> 00:27:00,012
Yeah, I guess so.

483
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:05,921
Oh, yeah? Lt's so beautiful. It's the
most beautiful thing I've ever seen.

484
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:09,859
Yes... I will marry you.

485
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:12,597
I will marry you, Doug.

486
00:27:22,941 --> 00:27:26,111
CougarCrate, where the web's
hottest cougars hang out.

487
00:27:26,111 --> 00:27:27,635
CougarCrate. Perfect.

488
00:27:27,946 --> 00:27:32,250
Prepare yourselVes, because
the cougars are on the prowl.

489
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:36,584
Look at you. You are nice.
I like that peace sign.

490
00:27:37,255 --> 00:27:38,882
Just warmin' up... What?

491
00:27:39,424 --> 00:27:40,659
- Calvin?
- Wh-What's going on?

492
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:42,293
He's gone all Beautiful Mind on us.

493
00:27:42,293 --> 00:27:43,851
He's off the fuckin' grid.

494
00:27:44,896 --> 00:27:46,931
- Come on, Baxter. Think!
- Dude,

495
00:27:46,931 --> 00:27:48,333
he's taken this shit
to a whole new level.

496
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:54,363
Everything...
divided by nine...

497
00:27:58,043 --> 00:28:02,080
Calvin, great. J.J. And I were trying
to delineate our search protocols.

498
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,981
Can you tell me anything more about
this video? Where'd you hear about it?

499
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:06,376
St-Stevie Schraeder.

500
00:28:06,951 --> 00:28:11,012
Stevie Schraeder. Stevie.

501
00:28:11,322 --> 00:28:14,223
Got it! Lt's time to bring
out the big guns.

502
00:28:17,562 --> 00:28:19,898
"Falcontron"? What's this?

503
00:28:19,898 --> 00:28:22,333
Lt's the most elite search
engine on the Internet.

504
00:28:22,333 --> 00:28:26,133
Only fifty humans have access.
Twelve are heads of state.

505
00:28:26,671 --> 00:28:28,373
So how do you have access to it?

506
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:32,104
I hacked into the mainframe
of the Bundesnachrichtendienst.

507
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:35,280
Stop making up words, Baxter.
Seriously.

508
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,415
He does that all the time.
He just makes up...

509
00:28:37,415 --> 00:28:39,906
It's the German intelligence bureau.

510
00:28:40,652 --> 00:28:43,553
"Bureau"? Lt's not a word.

511
00:28:45,457 --> 00:28:47,618

Veronica.

524
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:35,094
Neil.

525
00:29:35,573 --> 00:29:37,008
You look pale.

526
00:29:37,008 --> 00:29:38,409
You look pregnant.

527
00:29:38,409 --> 00:29:40,945
You look like you slept
in a soup kitchen urinal.

528
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:43,548
You look like you bathed in
a Dumpster behind the abortion clinic.

529
00:29:43,548 --> 00:29:45,950
You look like the kid who
got cancer for Christmas.

530
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,952
You look like the slutty one
on The Golden Girls.

531
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:49,587
- Dorothy?
- Blanche.

532
00:29:49,587 --> 00:29:52,123
You take that back!
You son of a bitch!

533
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:54,023
You take it back!
Take that back!

534
00:29:57,929 --> 00:29:59,362
I want to taste you.

535
00:29:59,931 --> 00:30:02,991
I want to lick you till you weep.

536
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:12,568
- How's your acid reflux?
- How's your HPV?

537
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:15,180
Lt's your HPV, Veronica.
I'm just carrying it.

538
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:18,016
Let's not have another
"chicken or the egg" debate, Neil.

539
00:30:18,016 --> 00:30:20,118
No. Let's.

540
00:30:20,118 --> 00:30:24,987
- Chicken.
- Egg.

541
00:30:26,391 --> 00:30:28,120
Your flesh...

542
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:31,187
slick with cocoa butter...

543
00:30:33,198 --> 00:30:34,597
It haunts me.

544
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:43,174
- How's Veronica?
- Veronica's fine, Veronica.

545
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:45,109
I can't believe you named
your dog Veronica.

546
00:30:45,109 --> 00:30:47,445
Can't believe you sucked off that
hobo from Magic Bean.

547
00:30:47,445 --> 00:30:49,140
He was a wizard, Neil.

548
00:30:51,482 --> 00:30:53,416
Shh. I wanna be on you.

549
00:30:54,085 --> 00:30:55,347
In you.

550
00:31:00,491 --> 00:31:02,160
I wanna be...

551
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,321
all...

552
00:31:09,133 --> 00:31:12,102
over your chin.

553
00:31:16,641 --> 00:31:19,109
Do you still like crème brûlée?

554
00:31:19,277 --> 00:31:22,247
Do you still like fingers
in your butthole?

555
00:31:22,247 --> 00:31:24,044
You know the answer is yes.

556
00:31:25,016 --> 00:31:26,084
Oh, Neil.

557
00:31:26,084 --> 00:31:27,551
Veronica.

558
00:31:28,019 --> 00:31:30,214
- Neil.
- Veronica.

559
00:31:30,521 --> 00:31:32,190
I wanna get over you.

560
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:34,385
I wanna give you a hickey
on your vagina.

561
00:31:46,137 --> 00:31:48,469
You already have, Neil.

562
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:52,072
You already have.

563
00:31:58,149 --> 00:31:59,912
L'll see you in church.

564
00:32:00,118 --> 00:32:01,483
Not if I see you f...

565
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:18,257
May I?

566
00:32:22,373 --> 00:32:27,276
I'm no Romeo, folks,
but I know what love is.

567
00:32:27,378 --> 00:32:32,583
It's an over-the-chinos rub and tug
during your first AA meeting.

568
00:32:32,583 --> 00:32:34,118
Yeah. Yes. Yeah. Yeah.

569
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:36,254
And if I was in your shoes,

570
00:32:36,254 --> 00:32:41,426
I would climb Dick Mountain
mouth first just to get her back!

571
00:32:41,426 --> 00:32:42,518
Yes, sir!

572
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:45,563
Are we gonna let
that foxy little thing...

573
00:32:45,563 --> 00:32:48,666
run willy-nilly out
of this boy's life?

574
00:32:48,666 --> 00:32:50,301
No! No!

575
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:52,203
Are we gonna help this youngster...

576
00:32:52,203 --> 00:32:54,967
take that sweet ass
to pound town?

577
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,576
- When's your shift up?
- Five a.m.

578
00:32:58,576 --> 00:33:01,477
- L'll take it till three.
- I got three to five!

579
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:03,302
Thank you.

580
00:33:04,515 --> 00:33:06,380
Don't be a bitch about it.

581
00:33:07,285 --> 00:33:08,513
Go get her, son!

582
00:33:17,228 --> 00:33:18,354
What's that?

583
00:33:43,988 --> 00:33:46,388
Lt's not as exciting
as you might think. It's-lt's...

584
00:33:47,258 --> 00:33:50,361
For me, I like to say it's more about,
just like, helping people, you know.

585
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:53,631
- It's not about punishing criminals...
- Right, yeah, I totally understand.

586
00:33:53,631 --> 00:33:55,466
- It's just, it makes you feel good...
- Robin!

587
00:33:55,466 --> 00:33:57,161
- Oh, no.
- Robin!

588
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:00,296
Hey, Robin. Where ya been?
Hi, how ya doing.

589
00:34:00,438 --> 00:34:02,303
You missed your meeting
with your parole officer.

590
00:34:03,007 --> 00:34:05,410
- What? Parole officer?
- No. He's kidding.

591
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:07,512
Yeah, yeah, this guy got in some
trouble a while back for...

592
00:34:07,512 --> 00:34:09,881
whipping out his little
Dick Grayson on a playground.

593
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:11,115
No, I didn't.

594
00:34:11,115 --> 00:34:12,550
But, it's all good. I mean,
your wife forgave you, right?

595
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,279
- What?
- You're married?

596
00:34:15,319 --> 00:34:17,355
- Married pervert. Yeah.
- No, I'm not!

597
00:34:17,355 --> 00:34:19,390
Stacey, I'm-I'm not married!
He's kidding!

598
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:21,359
Oh, man. Dodged that bullet.

599
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:23,461
The hell are you doing here, Batman!
You're gonna ruin this!

600
00:34:23,461 --> 00:34:25,363
Calm down!
Hey, look, I read on Twitter...

601
00:34:25,363 --> 00:34:28,199
that a super-villain's gonna bomb
this loser meet and greet.

602
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:31,269
So I'm here to save the day,
like I do, all the time.

603
00:34:31,269 --> 00:34:32,437
I mean, you know, it's my thing.

604
00:34:32,437 --> 00:34:34,272
- I'm the Batman!
- Yeah, baloney!

605
00:34:34,272 --> 00:34:37,175
You're here to ruin my chances with
women like you do all the time.

606
00:34:37,175 --> 00:34:39,610
No way, brother! No way!
No, I'm-I'm in support of this.

607
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:42,280
Get one more speed date, okay,
then we gotta find that bomb.

608
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,145
Ah, this sucks.

609
00:34:45,349 --> 00:34:48,186
Uh, little tip. Uh, less boy,
more wonder, right?

610
00:34:48,186 --> 00:34:49,220
Ah, that's very clever.

611
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:51,389
- Dazzle them!
- Yeah, okay. Thanks.

612
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:52,356
Hi.

613
00:34:52,623 --> 00:34:55,293
- Oh, hi.
- Lois. Lois Lane.

614
00:34:55,293 --> 00:34:57,352
No, l... I know. I've-I've...

615
00:34:57,895 --> 00:35:00,565
It's... lt's me, Robin.
We-We've met several times.

616
00:35:00,565 --> 00:35:04,135
- Robin what?
- Ro-Robin. That's it.

617
00:35:04,135 --> 00:35:06,304
I helped save you from Lex Luthor.

618
00:35:06,304 --> 00:35:07,371
Sorry.

619
00:35:07,371 --> 00:35:09,440
You were like, "l'll never forget
this as long as I live."

620
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,634
Sorry again.

621
00:35:11,075 --> 00:35:13,344
- I thought you were dating Superman.
- No, no.

622
00:35:13,344 --> 00:35:16,280
- We broke up about six months ago.
- I didn't-I didn't know that.

623
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,373
- He's been stalking me ever since.
- Really?

624
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:21,478
Last night, I look out
my bedroom window,

625
00:35:21,919 --> 00:35:24,021
and there he is just floating there,

626
00:35:24,021 --> 00:35:27,458
just stroking that nasty little
curl, and masturbating!

627
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:30,261
Blew his wad all over my window!

628
00:35:30,261 --> 00:35:33,097
- He broke the window!
- The, the... From the...

629
00:35:33,097 --> 00:35:36,066
Uh, his jizz is like a shotgun blast!

630
00:35:36,234 --> 00:35:38,634
You know that shiny stuff
in his hair? Lt's not hair gel.

631
00:35:40,938 --> 00:35:42,929
- Lois! Oh, my God!
- Oh, no!

632
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:46,077
- Nice to see you!
- Nice to be seen! Oh, my goodness!

633
00:35:46,077 --> 00:35:47,078
No, no, no. Yeah, we're in the...

634
00:35:47,078 --> 00:35:49,113
- Do you know each other?
- Yeah, we work together.

635
00:35:49,113 --> 00:35:50,307
- You do?
- Hey, how's Superman?

636
00:35:51,449 --> 00:35:53,284
I'm gonna give him a call right now,
actually. I need...

637
00:35:53,284 --> 00:35:55,286
- No, no! Don't do that!
- Oh, no, I'm gonna do it.

638
00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:56,921
- Batman, don't. Please. Please.
- It's already ringing.

639
00:35:56,921 --> 00:35:59,657
Hey, Soups! What's up, brother!
Lt's the Dark Knight.

640
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:01,259
Hey, man, I was just thinking
about you here...

641
00:36:01,259 --> 00:36:03,027
'cause I'm sitting with Lois...

642
00:36:03,027 --> 00:36:05,296
and she's on a date
with my boy, Robin.

643
00:36:05,296 --> 00:36:07,331
- No!
- Oh, he hung up. I lost him.

644
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:10,168
Stay away from Lois
or l'll use my heat vision...

645
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:13,934
to fuse your balls into
one big ridiculous uniball.

646
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,273
Superman, you don't
understand.

647
00:36:15,273 --> 00:36:17,503
I'm not here to hit on your
girlfriend. That's crazy!

648
00:36:17,575 --> 00:36:20,111
Batman and I are undercover
and we're looking for a bomb.

649
00:36:20,111 --> 00:36:23,481
Bomb? I don't give two
super-shits about a bomb.

650
00:36:23,481 --> 00:36:27,611
As long as I'm balls-deep
in Lois, I'm solid gold.

651
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:31,115
Stay away from Lois, bitch!

652
00:36:31,589 --> 00:36:33,216
Goddammit!
That's his thing!

653
00:36:34,158 --> 00:36:35,526
No, so I told him, you know,

654
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:37,161
"I mean, we're gonna
be fighting crime, buddy, so..."

655
00:36:37,161 --> 00:36:38,229
Oh, there he is.

656
00:36:38,229 --> 00:36:39,397
"Uh, you know, you should
put on some pants."

657
00:36:39,397 --> 00:36:41,232
But he liked the costume
the way it is, so,

658
00:36:41,232 --> 00:36:42,529
you know, what are
you gonna do. Kids.

659
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,969
- Well... Thursday?
- Thursday it is!

660
00:36:44,969 --> 00:36:46,404
- See ya then.
- All right, now.

661
00:36:46,404 --> 00:36:49,373
And, nice legs.

662
00:36:50,508 --> 00:36:52,510
You make me wear this.
He makes me wear this outfit!

663
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:54,375
So unfair! I hate it!

664
00:36:56,447 --> 00:36:58,349
She's a hoot! All right,
that was your date. Let's go.

665
00:36:58,349 --> 00:37:01,419
- Bullcrap! That doesn't count!
- What do you mean that doesn't count?

666
00:37:01,419 --> 00:37:02,687
That was a girl, this was a date.

667
00:37:02,687 --> 00:37:04,450
Now, let's boogie.
We gotta go find that bomb.

668
00:37:05,189 --> 00:37:07,291
Please, just let me do one more.
That doesn't count. Please.

669
00:37:07,291 --> 00:37:09,527
Oh, my God, you're such a baby.
Go! Sit down. Fine.

670
00:37:09,527 --> 00:37:10,595
- Yes!
- Fine. Go ahead.

671
00:37:10,595 --> 00:37:12,330
Have fun. But you're not
gonna do it on your own.

672
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:13,531
- Pop that in your ear.
- What's that?

673
00:37:13,531 --> 00:37:15,600
What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
get underneath the table,

674
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:19,503
hide down there and feed you lines
to help bag this next gal.

675
00:37:19,503 --> 00:37:21,138
Oh, right,
like Cyrano de Bergerac.

676
00:37:21,138 --> 00:37:23,040
I don't know what that is.
It's more like Roxanne.

677
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,376
Okay, but look, I-I'd really
rather do this on my own.

678
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:27,411
Okay, and I hear you, and I appreciate
what you're saying,

679
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:29,606
- but I, you know, I'm gonna do it.
- Please don't.

680
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:33,017
- I'm gonna do it.
- Batman, don't. Please, please, don't...

681
00:37:33,017 --> 00:37:36,180
Hi. Sorry, sorry I'm late.
There's a line in the bathroom.

682
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,622
Hi. I'm Supergirl.

683
00:37:37,622 --> 00:37:39,556
- My name...
- I'm Robin.

684
00:37:40,458 --> 00:37:41,425
Hi, I'm Robin.

685
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:44,595
Um, so where you from?

686
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:47,086
- So, where you from?
- L... Um, Krypton.

687
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:50,935
Krypton, eh. Where...
That's, that's, uh...

688
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:52,436
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, shit!

689
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:54,538
- Dude, I can see her snatch.
- Dude, I can sn...

690
00:37:54,538 --> 00:37:57,074
Oh, my God! I can't believe
the size of this thing.

691
00:37:57,074 --> 00:38:01,511
It's like a giant fucking cornfield.
It's enormous down here.

692
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:05,149
It's crazy. Look at that.
I-I-I feel like at any moment,

693
00:38:05,149 --> 00:38:08,452
Shoeless Joe Jackson could walk out
of it and I could play catch with him.

694
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:12,590
Krypton. I-I hear it's really nice.
I-I have never been...

695
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:15,426
You didn't hear that the Sun supernova
and destroyed our entire race?

696
00:38:15,426 --> 00:38:16,894
I wanna wash dishes with it.

697
00:38:16,894 --> 00:38:19,363
Did it? I did not...

698
00:38:19,363 --> 00:38:21,999
It's a huge, bushy
catastrophe down here.

699
00:38:21,999 --> 00:38:24,468
Feel like Sean Penn should do
a benefit for this thing. It's...

700
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:27,405
What? Oh, no.
You can hear him, can't you?

701
00:38:27,405 --> 00:38:28,429
Yeah, I can hear him.

702
00:38:30,107 --> 00:38:32,405
I can also see Batman
underneath the table.

703
00:38:32,576 --> 00:38:34,312
Cause of the x-ray vision.
Of course.

704
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:38,248
No, I can just see him. It's a cafe
table. I mean, it's really obvious.

705
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:40,507
- Hi.
- Hi.

706
00:38:41,619 --> 00:38:44,554
Ah, dude. I'm so sorry about
your family dying and...

707
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:48,523
Oh, man! That took me back
to the seventies, huh?

708
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:52,563
Hold on. There's our culprit.
It's the Penguin.

709
00:38:52,563 --> 00:38:54,532
Excuse me. I'm gonna go
do some Batman-ing.

710
00:38:54,532 --> 00:38:55,999
Do you need any... Can I help?

711
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:01,869
Oh, it's hard to pick up with gloves.
There ya go.

712
00:39:02,106 --> 00:39:04,608
Excuse me, sweetie. How ya doing.
You mind fucking off for a little bit?

713
00:39:04,608 --> 00:39:06,310
Thank you. I appreciate it.
Thanks.

714
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:07,578
- See you later, citizen.
- How dare you!

715
00:39:07,578 --> 00:39:10,570
You son of a bitch! Where's
the bomb, you fat fucker?

716
00:39:11,115 --> 00:39:13,276
- Hey! Asshole!
- Oh, shit.

717
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:15,486
What do you think you are?
Some big man?

718
00:39:15,486 --> 00:39:17,388
Picking on a little fat guy?

719
00:39:17,388 --> 00:39:19,481
Take it easy! That's the Penguin.
That's what I do.

720
00:39:20,391 --> 00:39:21,551
Why didn't you call me?

721
00:39:21,625 --> 00:39:22,893
L... No... l...

722
00:39:22,893 --> 00:39:24,588
You said that you
were gonna call me.

723
00:39:24,929 --> 00:39:28,456
Wait a minute. Did I not? I know I
dialed a number... Did I not hit "send"?

724
00:39:29,266 --> 00:39:32,861
You said that you were gonna stick
by me no matter what happened.

725
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:37,975
And then your little Bat-condom
breaks, and then you just disappear!

726
00:39:37,975 --> 00:39:42,309
Do you know what it's like going
to Planned Parenthood by yourself,

727
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,409
when you're Wonder Woman?

728
00:39:44,615 --> 00:39:46,450
Okay. Not very romantic talk.

729
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:49,044
Roe v. Wade here
at a speed dating situation.

730
00:39:49,353 --> 00:39:52,223
Uh, look, I was fighting crime!
Ask Robin. Robin, vouch for me.

731
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:54,525
- He cries after sex. Do you know that?
- Why would I know that?

732
00:39:54,525 --> 00:39:57,495
Like a baby.
After sex, what do you say?

733
00:39:57,495 --> 00:40:00,531
"Oh, my soul's so dark."
Because you saw some bats...

734
00:40:00,531 --> 00:40:02,500
when you were little?
You pussy!

735
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:05,333
Attention, Gotham City speed daters:

736
00:40:06,537 --> 00:40:08,072
How the fuck did he
get over there?

737
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:11,142
Lt was all a clever ruse.
I'm not speed dating.

738
00:40:11,142 --> 00:40:13,133
Some of you should remember
I'm happily married.

739
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:15,613
- That's right!
- You were all there at the wedding.

740
00:40:15,613 --> 00:40:17,882
- Okay, bomb strapped to my chest.
- Oh, yes. In any case,

741
00:40:17,882 --> 00:40:20,117
you all have to give me some
unimaginable sum of money...

742
00:40:20,117 --> 00:40:22,483
or else I'm going to blow up
Supergirl with this bomb.

743
00:40:24,355 --> 00:40:26,190
Dat dat dat dat! The detonator
is in this umbrella.

744
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:27,521
- Cool it.
- No, you cool it.

745
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:30,561
My non-monocled eye!
Where are you?

746
00:40:30,561 --> 00:40:31,585
Disarm!

747
00:40:32,963 --> 00:40:34,089
Yes!

748
00:40:36,567 --> 00:40:38,262
- Are you okay?
- I think so.

749
00:40:38,669 --> 00:40:40,864
You saved my life!

750
00:40:41,539 --> 00:40:42,904
Just-Just doing my job.

751
00:40:43,908 --> 00:40:45,307
Kiss. Kiss her.

752
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:48,878
Open her mouth
and touch tongues.

753
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:55,886
Put your tongue inside her mouth...

754
00:40:55,886 --> 00:40:58,514
and that'll coax her tongue
to go into your mouth!

755
00:41:00,357 --> 00:41:02,848
Yeah! You, uh, squeeze her boobies.

756
00:41:03,027 --> 00:41:04,551
Yeah, and touch her butt.

757
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:07,898
- Doesn't that look nice?
- It looks so nice.

758
00:41:08,098 --> 00:41:10,896
Oh, yeah. Hold on!
Not so fast!

759
00:41:14,538 --> 00:41:15,906
Oh, God!

760
00:41:15,906 --> 00:41:17,339
- Riddler!
- Riddler!

761
00:41:18,242 --> 00:41:20,267
That is right! The Riddler!

762
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:24,582
In a diabolical scheme to get Robin and
me to this speed date to stop a bomb,

763
00:41:24,582 --> 00:41:29,587
only to lure Robin away
to some seedy warehouse...

764
00:41:29,587 --> 00:41:33,357
where you're gonna hang him above
a vat filled with thumbtacks...

765
00:41:33,357 --> 00:41:35,552
or lizards or some fucking bullshit!

766
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,628
Well it didn't work, muchacho!

767
00:41:37,628 --> 00:41:39,196
That was amazing.
How did you do that?

768
00:41:39,196 --> 00:41:41,187
I mean, how'd you know
that she was a fake?

769
00:41:41,265 --> 00:41:43,067
Bush that size is only good
for one thing,

770
00:41:43,067 --> 00:41:45,636
and that one thang is hidin' the wang!
You know what I'm saying?

771
00:41:45,636 --> 00:41:47,671
Wait. Let me get this straight.
So you knew all the way back then?

772
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:49,640
- You knew that she was a dude?
- Whole time.

773
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,442
Wh-Why'd you make me kiss her?

774
00:41:51,442 --> 00:41:53,376
Him. This.

775
00:41:53,444 --> 00:41:54,478
I don't know.

776
00:41:54,478 --> 00:41:57,572
I guess I woke up this morning with
a little case of the fuck-arounds.

777
00:41:57,948 --> 00:41:59,939
You know I'm just having fun.
My buddy! Woo!

778
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:21,069
Remember this?

779
00:42:22,439 --> 00:42:23,599
Ugly isn't it?

780
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:31,607
But think how they feel.

781
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:35,852
Working without thanks
to make your life better.

782
00:42:47,665 --> 00:42:51,192
Lonely, unloVed, hurt.

783
00:42:57,675 --> 00:43:01,008
Physical, Verbal, emotional abuse...

784
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:03,874
to get what we want done.

785
00:43:07,384 --> 00:43:09,614
Can't you see
they're doing their best?

786
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:19,630
They're not trying to take
oVer your world.

787
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:22,861
They're just trying to find
a little place in your hearts.

788
00:43:23,667 --> 00:43:27,899
Remember, machines,
they're full of kids.

789
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:36,845
Dude, click the button.

790
00:43:38,015 --> 00:43:39,312
Do not click the button.

791
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:42,880
- Who the fuck are you?
- I am the Minotaur.

792
00:43:43,087 --> 00:43:44,955
You are in my maze.

793
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:47,091
Do you know where
we can find Movie 43?

794
00:43:47,091 --> 00:43:50,083
Movie 43? Movie 43?

795
00:43:50,661 --> 00:43:54,995
Are you prepared to haVe your brains
butchered into tiny pieces?

796
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:59,933
Are you prepared to haVe a starving
rat nibble out your eyeballs,

797
00:44:00,004 --> 00:44:05,009
and then haVe the holes fucked
by angry, thick-dicked wolVes?

798
00:44:05,009 --> 00:44:08,035
Dude, calm down. I think you're-
I think you're just confused.

799
00:44:08,545 --> 00:44:11,139
We're-we're talking about Movie 43.
You've never heard of that.

800
00:44:11,949 --> 00:44:14,008
Oh, yeah. She's here.

801
00:44:14,551 --> 00:44:16,917
I think we have a connection.

802
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:22,493
It is the one moVie that can bring
down society as we know it.

803
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:25,362
No, dude. That's something
different. I guarantee it.

804
00:44:25,362 --> 00:44:29,967
I haVe taken a Vow to keep
anybody from Viewing this film.

805
00:44:29,967 --> 00:44:31,001
Dude, dude.

806
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:34,300
This guy's for real. He's protected
by firewalls I've never even seen.

807
00:44:34,605 --> 00:44:35,973
We gotta click this button.

808
00:44:35,973 --> 00:44:38,373
Do not click the button.

809
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:41,076
Do not click the...

810
00:44:42,446 --> 00:44:43,572
Suck it!

811
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:56,982
Tyler De Soto. Fifteen.
Port St. Lucie, Florida.

812
00:44:57,127 --> 00:44:58,924
He only lost a finger.

813
00:45:05,135 --> 00:45:06,295
It's horrific.

814
00:45:07,337 --> 00:45:09,940
I'm still not seeing what
the problem is, though.

815
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:10,998
Brian?

816
00:45:11,108 --> 00:45:15,135
The iBabe has an advanced
3.2 gigahertz processor.

817
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:18,549
We left an opening for a vent and
then we placed a highly-efficient,

818
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:23,282
super powerful micro-fan
in the opening.

819
00:45:24,054 --> 00:45:27,124
- And?
- The vent is in her,

820
00:45:27,124 --> 00:45:28,158
Lower quadrant.

821
00:45:28,158 --> 00:45:29,927
Vagi-port.

822
00:45:29,927 --> 00:45:31,595
- Vagina.
- Vagi-port.

823
00:45:31,595 --> 00:45:33,063
The vent is in the vagina.

824
00:45:33,063 --> 00:45:35,466
A certain percentage
of our younger demographic...

825
00:45:35,466 --> 00:45:39,027
are sticking their
you-know-what in the vent.

826
00:45:39,937 --> 00:45:41,071
No, I don't know what.

827
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:43,403
Kids are sticking
their penises in the vent.

828
00:45:43,941 --> 00:45:46,603
The fan then mangles
their penises.

829
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:48,011
Disgusting!

830
00:45:48,011 --> 00:45:50,414
Sir, the iBabe is a...

831
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:53,016
High fidelity music player.

832
00:45:53,016 --> 00:45:56,349
Yes, it also looks and feels
exactly like a naked woman.

833
00:45:57,254 --> 00:46:01,418
Teenage boys are physically
attracted to naked women.

834
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:04,026
Our research doesn't
support that, sir.

835
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:07,552
Look, at the very least, we need to
put a warning sticker on the box.

836
00:46:08,198 --> 00:46:12,362
Other MP3 players don't have a
warning not to have sex with it. Right?

837
00:46:13,203 --> 00:46:15,865
A bag of potato chips
doesn't have a warning,

838
00:46:16,039 --> 00:46:18,439
"Please don't fuck
these potato chips."

839
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:20,542
Am I crazy here?

840
00:46:21,044 --> 00:46:23,205
None of us could have
seen this one coming.

841
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,281
I did.

842
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:26,408
Take it easy, Erin Brockovich.

843
00:46:28,986 --> 00:46:31,288
R and D team. You did
extensive testing here.

844
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:35,125
Did you anticipate anybody breaching
the cooling system? Any red flags?

845
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:36,183
Dave?

846
00:46:39,029 --> 00:46:43,591
Also, we've broken down
our problem into three steps.

847
00:46:43,901 --> 00:46:46,870
Step 1: Kid buys iBabe.

848
00:46:48,205 --> 00:46:51,174
Step 2: Kid fucks iBabe.

849
00:46:52,042 --> 00:46:56,843
Step 3: Kid mangles dick
and sues iBabe.

850
00:46:58,182 --> 00:47:03,415
Our goal is to eliminate
step two and step three.

851
00:47:07,224 --> 00:47:09,624
Now I know what the problem is.

852
00:47:11,228 --> 00:47:14,857
Why don't we just move the fan?
Why don't we just put it in her ear?

853
00:47:14,932 --> 00:47:16,627
No. No, no, no, no, no, sir.

854
00:47:17,267 --> 00:47:20,270
Uh, my team spent two years
doing the impossible,

855
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:24,107
and you're pretty much just telling us
to go back and start from scratch.

856
00:47:24,107 --> 00:47:26,243
You know, to go fuck ourselves!

857
00:47:26,243 --> 00:47:30,080
Okay, look. The iBabe weighs over
a hundred pounds, okay?

858
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:33,050
Lt's basically illegal
to take it out in public.

859
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:36,220
Women's organizations are calling
for the boycott of our entire company.

860
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:40,850
Our stock is plummeting and kids'
dicks are getting horribly mangled!

861
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,222
Uh, come in, come in, come in.

862
00:47:44,328 --> 00:47:49,132
Sir, may I introduce you
to the iBabe Special Edition.

863
00:47:49,132 --> 00:47:50,292
Oh, my God.

864
00:47:53,403 --> 00:47:56,273
Faster processing,
double storage capacity,

865
00:47:56,273 --> 00:47:58,264
and how about that elegant finish.

866
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:02,178
Just gorgeous. Gorgeous, gorgeous!

867
00:48:02,346 --> 00:48:04,047
- Congratulations!
- Thank you.

868
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:07,949
Finally we can give our customers
a choice of color.

869
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:12,247
Oh, my God. Just when I thought
it couldn't get more offensive.

870
00:48:14,157 --> 00:48:15,920
Oh, for Christ's sake.

871
00:48:18,128 --> 00:48:19,288
Yeah. Now I understand.

872
00:48:33,644 --> 00:48:35,168
Enough! Enough!

873
00:48:35,312 --> 00:48:38,248
What do you want?
Money? Women?

874
00:48:38,248 --> 00:48:41,081
Just stop looking for MoVie 43.

875
00:48:41,318 --> 00:48:42,512
Hey! Who are you?

876
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:46,156
MoVie 43. Where is MoVie 43?

877
00:48:46,156 --> 00:48:48,147
I don't know what
you're talking about.

878
00:48:49,326 --> 00:48:51,528
Where is MoVie 43? Don't lie!

879
00:48:51,528 --> 00:48:53,860
Get away from me! Get off me! No!

880
00:48:54,631 --> 00:48:56,121
The fuck, man!

881
00:48:58,001 --> 00:49:00,470
So you know where MoVie 43 is.

882
00:49:00,470 --> 00:49:01,505
No!

883
00:49:01,505 --> 00:49:04,308
The moVie that allows you
to see into the future.

884
00:49:04,308 --> 00:49:06,476
No! Lt will destroy society!

885
00:49:06,476 --> 00:49:09,172
He will unleash
the dead up in protocol!

886
00:49:09,379 --> 00:49:12,109
Did Stevie Schraeder
tell you any of this?

887
00:49:12,249 --> 00:49:14,308
Who is this SteVie Schraeder?

888
00:49:14,584 --> 00:49:16,347
Who is SteVie Schraeder?

889
00:49:16,453 --> 00:49:20,190
- Who is this SteVie Schraeder?
- I don't know SteVie Schraeder!

890
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:21,358
- You lie!
- What the fuck?

891
00:49:21,358 --> 00:49:23,026
Fuck you!

892
00:49:23,026 --> 00:49:25,529
Who is SteVie Schraeder? You tell
me where SteVie Schraeder is!

893
00:49:25,529 --> 00:49:27,130
Who is this motherfucker?

894
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:29,189
He's a kid in my fucking
Driver's Ed class!

895
00:49:29,566 --> 00:49:34,237
You will find us MoVie 43,
J.J. And Baxter.

896
00:49:34,237 --> 00:49:35,636
What the fuck, man!

897
00:49:36,373 --> 00:49:38,102
Keep looking!

898
00:49:38,542 --> 00:49:40,567
- I'm looking!
- Don't look!

899
00:49:43,246 --> 00:49:45,578
I'm, uh, RSVP-ing
to Sammy's Bar Mitzvah.

900
00:49:46,350 --> 00:49:47,612
Yeah, me too.

901
00:49:48,352 --> 00:49:50,616
The party, not the service.

902
00:49:51,254 --> 00:49:54,223
My mom always makes me
go to both. Sucks.

903
00:49:56,193 --> 00:49:57,182
Yeah.

904
00:50:16,279 --> 00:50:17,371
Yeah!

905
00:50:18,015 --> 00:50:21,109
Nathan on a date for once!

906
00:50:21,251 --> 00:50:23,378
Jesus, Mikey, shut up!

907
00:50:23,487 --> 00:50:26,979
What? Mom told me to watch
you guys. I'm just doing my job.

908
00:50:28,058 --> 00:50:29,389
I mean it, Mikey. Leave!

909
00:50:31,395 --> 00:50:32,555
I'm watching you.

910
00:50:35,332 --> 00:50:37,232
Sorry, my brother's an idiot.

911
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:39,366
Whatever.

912
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:47,303
- You have a bathroom?
- Totally. It's right back there.

913
00:50:58,288 --> 00:50:59,380
- Yuck!
- Nathan?

914
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:02,459
Nathan, l...

915
00:51:02,459 --> 00:51:05,495
My brother spilled fruit punch on the
couch. There's a big red stain.

916
00:51:05,495 --> 00:51:07,395
I, I, um... I need to go.

917
00:51:08,031 --> 00:51:10,397
But you're not getting picked up
for another half hour.

918
00:51:10,634 --> 00:51:12,898
Wanna sit and watch
some more TV?

919
00:51:14,971 --> 00:51:18,463
Yeah. L'll-l'll just... l'll just
watch it from back here.

920
00:51:20,043 --> 00:51:21,601
That's cool. I like standing.

921
00:51:24,347 --> 00:51:27,908
Whoa! Mikey spilled fruit
punch on the wall, too!

922
00:51:28,318 --> 00:51:31,321
- My mom is gonna be so pissed!
- Nathan, I really need to go!

923
00:51:31,321 --> 00:51:33,490
Hey, lovebirds, I hope I'm not...

924
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:36,259
Holy shit, you are covered
in blood! Oh, my God!

925
00:51:36,259 --> 00:51:37,961
- What?
- Oh, my God!

926
00:51:37,961 --> 00:51:39,596
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

927
00:51:39,596 --> 00:51:42,332
Oh, my God! You must've s-sat
on a nail or something!

928
00:51:42,332 --> 00:51:44,960
- You idiot! She's having her period!
- Oh, my God!

929
00:51:45,335 --> 00:51:46,563
What do I do?

930
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:48,672
You don't know what to do?
You've never had your period before?

931
00:51:48,672 --> 00:51:50,907
- No, I haven't.
- Oh, my God,

932
00:51:50,907 --> 00:51:52,374
Mikey, she's already
lost a lot of blood!

933
00:51:53,410 --> 00:51:54,711
Okay. Um, you know what?

934
00:51:54,711 --> 00:51:56,713
Mom's gotta have some tampons
around here somewhere, right?

935
00:51:56,713 --> 00:51:58,982
Oh, my God!
This is not happening!

936
00:51:58,982 --> 00:52:00,484
Fuck! You are way skinnier than Mom!

937
00:52:00,484 --> 00:52:02,352
There-There's no way
they're gonna fit you!

938
00:52:02,352 --> 00:52:03,987
Look, I'm just gonna walk home!

939
00:52:03,987 --> 00:52:06,353
No, no, no, no! You can't walk
home in your condition, silly!

940
00:52:06,490 --> 00:52:07,991
Mikey, hurry!

941
00:52:07,991 --> 00:52:10,892
There's just plastic bags! I don't
know what the fuck you want me to do!

942
00:52:12,095 --> 00:52:13,196
- What?
- Wipe yourself!

943
00:52:13,196 --> 00:52:14,898
Hey, hey, hey!
Guys, I'm home early.

944
00:52:14,898 --> 00:52:16,126
Dad, help us!

945
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:18,491
Pardon me, I'm Nathan's father, Steve.

946
00:52:19,202 --> 00:52:22,339
Oh, we're just gonna have to plug
it up. I found this and this.

947
00:52:22,339 --> 00:52:23,397
All right, what's going on here?

948
00:52:25,442 --> 00:52:27,644
Nathan's date is on her period
for the first time,

949
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:29,412
and she's bleeding everywhere!

950
00:52:29,412 --> 00:52:30,447
- Oh, disgusting.
- What?

951
00:52:30,447 --> 00:52:32,149
I mean, congratulations,
young lady.

952
00:52:32,149 --> 00:52:34,384
"Congratulations"?
She's bleeding to death!

953
00:52:34,384 --> 00:52:36,419
Oh, my God!
My stomach hurts!

954
00:52:36,419 --> 00:52:38,121
She's having contractions!

955
00:52:38,121 --> 00:52:39,918
No! Oh, no!

956
00:52:40,590 --> 00:52:41,892
All right.

957
00:52:41,892 --> 00:52:45,395
N-Nine-one-one? Yeah, my friend
is bleeding out of her vagina!

958
00:52:45,395 --> 00:52:46,384
Nathan, Nathan, listen!

959
00:52:46,496 --> 00:52:48,487
Why are you laughing at me?

960
00:52:48,932 --> 00:52:52,299
Lt's just... lt's...
The-The lining of Amanda's...

961
00:52:52,602 --> 00:52:55,332
internal organs just
spilling out of her.

962
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:57,337
Oh, my God!

963
00:52:57,641 --> 00:52:59,442
Look, I'm not dying!

964
00:52:59,442 --> 00:53:01,376
I got frozen peas and a sponge!

965
00:53:01,678 --> 00:53:03,613
Lf you wanna keep the lining intact,

966
00:53:03,613 --> 00:53:07,918
the man has to insert his
erect phallus into her vagina.

967
00:53:07,918 --> 00:53:10,113
- A what?
- You know what? I got a perfect thing.

968
00:53:11,421 --> 00:53:13,056
Maxi pad on a stick.

969
00:53:13,056 --> 00:53:15,388
Oh, my God! I wanna kill myself!

970
00:53:15,559 --> 00:53:17,117
Hello! Hey, baby, you ready?

971
00:53:18,461 --> 00:53:20,163
- What the hell's going on here?
- Dad!

972
00:53:20,163 --> 00:53:21,221
Oh, my God! Honey!

973
00:53:21,431 --> 00:53:24,434
What the hell kind of sick family
squashes a large tomato...

974
00:53:24,434 --> 00:53:25,958
on my daughter's pants?

975
00:53:26,336 --> 00:53:28,572
Whoa. Watch what you're
implying about my family.

976
00:53:28,572 --> 00:53:30,597
Oh, I don't gotta watch
anything, Jack!

977
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:33,438
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

978
00:53:33,577 --> 00:53:34,611
- You touching me?
- Yeah, yeah, bitch, yeah!

979
00:53:34,611 --> 00:53:36,112
- You touching me?
- You're not to touch me!

980
00:53:36,112 --> 00:53:37,909
- Let's go, bitch!
- Let's go!

981
00:53:39,249 --> 00:53:41,410
Sucker punch him! Sucker punch
him in the throat!

982
00:53:43,587 --> 00:53:45,452
Everybody shut up!

983
00:53:47,157 --> 00:53:50,293
Look, I'm just a regular seventh-grade
girl getting my period,

984
00:53:50,293 --> 00:53:53,126
and it really sucks that it had
to be in front of all you idiots.

985
00:53:55,465 --> 00:53:58,457
Dad, call Mom and tell her
to meet us at home.

986
00:54:03,506 --> 00:54:05,371
She's got her period?

987
00:54:06,576 --> 00:54:07,941
So disgusting.

988
00:54:08,612 --> 00:54:11,137
You don't have a camping tarp
I could borrow, do you?

989
00:54:12,182 --> 00:54:13,444
Sorry about all that.

990
00:54:14,618 --> 00:54:16,347
Hey, honey, don't sit in the car!

991
00:54:17,487 --> 00:54:20,081
Vagina is way too complicated!

992
00:54:20,490 --> 00:54:21,980
Yeah, no shit.

993
00:54:24,327 --> 00:54:25,589
Really?

994
00:54:29,432 --> 00:54:30,592
Dad, that was epic!

995
00:54:32,235 --> 00:54:35,398
I've been trying to push that puppy out
since this morning's conference call.

996
00:54:35,472 --> 00:54:38,236
Woo! I gotta take a massive dump,
and then we're watching the game.

997
00:54:38,341 --> 00:54:39,603
- Yeah.
- Yes!

998
00:54:47,617 --> 00:54:48,879
Oh, nice!

999
00:55:17,881 --> 00:55:19,212
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

1000
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:20,476
Look who we found.

1001
00:55:22,585 --> 00:55:23,574
J. J?

1002
00:55:24,521 --> 00:55:26,890
- Stevie Schraeder?
- I freaking told you.

1003
00:55:26,890 --> 00:55:28,558
Wh... What the fuck!
How'd he get there?

1004
00:55:28,558 --> 00:55:31,394
Stevie, tell them about Movie 43!

1005
00:55:31,394 --> 00:55:34,898
What's MoVie 43?
They keep asking me that.

1006
00:55:34,898 --> 00:55:37,332
- Cut off SteVie Schraeder's finger
- What!

1007
00:55:37,467 --> 00:55:39,569
No, don't cut off
Stevie Schraeder's finger!

1008
00:55:39,569 --> 00:55:42,372
Don't cut off SteVie Schraeder's
finger! Please!

1009
00:55:42,372 --> 00:55:44,140
Movie 43 isn't real.

1010
00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:46,409
It's just something Calvin
and I made up to prank you!

1011
00:55:46,409 --> 00:55:47,977
Well, apparently it is real,

1012
00:55:47,977 --> 00:55:50,468
and we need to find it
or else your stupid friend dies!

1013
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:53,508
- Unless...
- Unless what? Unless what?

1014
00:55:54,117 --> 00:55:56,653
I can fashion
a ninety-one-F-Theta Box.

1015
00:55:56,653 --> 00:55:58,922
No. Not the Theta Box. Please!
Do not do that!

1016
00:55:58,922 --> 00:56:01,591
Go! Make a Theta Box, dude.
Whatever that is.

1017
00:56:01,591 --> 00:56:03,252
Okay. Don't wait for me.

1018
00:56:05,128 --> 00:56:07,528
Movie 43. Wh-Where is it?
Where is it?

1019
00:56:12,936 --> 00:56:14,563
Go fuck yourself, asshole!

1020
00:56:15,638 --> 00:56:17,071
Don't do this.

1021
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:20,142
Brian, we're best friends, man.
You can't move out.

1022
00:56:20,443 --> 00:56:21,611
You fucked my girlfriend, dude.

1023
00:56:21,611 --> 00:56:23,203
One time.

1024
00:56:23,646 --> 00:56:25,081
For a week.

1025
00:56:25,081 --> 00:56:26,981
- What?
- But I want to make it up to you.

1026
00:56:27,584 --> 00:56:29,279
Can I fuck your girlfriend?

1027
00:56:29,953 --> 00:56:31,888
Yes, but she broke up with me...

1028
00:56:31,888 --> 00:56:33,656
when she found out
I slept with your girlfriend...

1029
00:56:33,656 --> 00:56:35,248
so I can't arrange it.

1030
00:56:35,558 --> 00:56:39,153
But Brian, I got you something.

1031
00:56:39,929 --> 00:56:43,330
Best birthday present ever.
You are going to love this.

1032
00:56:44,434 --> 00:56:46,994
- Is this really necessary?
- Trust me.

1033
00:56:49,005 --> 00:56:51,496
It's better if it's a...

1034
00:56:51,674 --> 00:56:55,132
One, two, three, surprise!

1035
00:56:59,516 --> 00:57:01,916
I know, right, buddy?
Happy birthday.

1036
00:57:02,018 --> 00:57:03,586
You kidnapped an lrish midget.

1037
00:57:03,586 --> 00:57:06,022
No, I caught you a leprechaun.

1038
00:57:06,022 --> 00:57:07,922
Moron. There's no such
thing as leprechauns.

1039
00:57:08,591 --> 00:57:10,024
Dude, watch this.

1040
00:57:11,361 --> 00:57:12,395
Hey, little buddy.

1041
00:57:12,395 --> 00:57:15,990
Tell my friend you're going
to give us a big pot of gold.

1042
00:57:16,633 --> 00:57:19,436
I'm going to cut off your balls
and feed them to you!

1043
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:20,630
Good Lord.

1044
00:57:21,638 --> 00:57:25,608
He's just joking. He's got to give us
the gold. That's the rules. Right?

1045
00:57:25,608 --> 00:57:29,203
The last thing you'll ever see is
my cock, skull-fucking you!

1046
00:57:32,582 --> 00:57:34,106
Let me ask him again.

1047
00:57:36,886 --> 00:57:38,854
Give us the fucking gold!

1048
00:57:39,889 --> 00:57:41,124
Do you want the lights on or off...

1049
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:43,490
when I fuck you with
a pair of rusty scissors?

1050
00:57:45,028 --> 00:57:47,464
Stop, stop! Chill! Chill!

1051
00:57:47,464 --> 00:57:50,500
What are you doing?
You're going to kill him!

1052
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:53,992
Watch out! Relax! L'll handle this,
okay? L'll handle this.

1053
00:57:57,106 --> 00:57:59,540
Hey, Mr. Leprechaun.

1054
00:58:01,978 --> 00:58:04,013
I am super sorry about this.

1055
00:58:04,013 --> 00:58:05,515
It's just a misunderstanding,

1056
00:58:05,515 --> 00:58:09,611
so what I'm going to do...
is untie you and let you go.

1057
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:11,851
How does that sound?

1058
00:58:13,022 --> 00:58:14,887
Okay... but first...

1059
00:58:16,192 --> 00:58:19,855
Lick my crusty lrish taint,
ya yeast-breeding cunt hole!

1060
00:58:20,663 --> 00:58:23,598
Die! Die, you little magical fuck!

1061
00:58:24,033 --> 00:58:26,669
Whoa, stop! Stop! Think!

1062
00:58:26,669 --> 00:58:29,239
Lf he's dead, he can't tell us
where the gold is!

1063
00:58:29,239 --> 00:58:33,505
Fucking giants.
Motherfucking full-growns!

1064
00:58:34,043 --> 00:58:37,180
When all this is over, I'm going
to crawl up your mother's cunt...

1065
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:38,982
and start a fucking campfire!

1066
00:58:38,982 --> 00:58:42,919
Hey! No! Shut up!
You can't do anything...

1067
00:58:42,919 --> 00:58:46,089
because you're tiny and tied to a
chair, and nobody knows where you are.

1068
00:58:46,089 --> 00:58:47,113
No one!

1069
00:58:48,658 --> 00:58:50,387
I wouldn't bet on that.

1070
00:58:50,894 --> 00:58:52,088
Who's calling?

1071
00:58:53,963 --> 00:58:55,031
Hello?

1072
00:58:55,031 --> 00:58:57,467
So this is what a dead
man sounds like.

1073
00:58:57,467 --> 00:58:59,435
- It's another leprechaun.
- Fuck!

1074
00:58:59,435 --> 00:59:00,904
Lf that's my brother...

1075
00:59:00,904 --> 00:59:04,340
prepare to have your dickhole
stretched over a fucking fire hydrant!

1076
00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:06,910
- What's wrong with your fucking mouth?
- Gag him.

1077
00:59:06,910 --> 00:59:07,899
Your balls...

1078
00:59:09,078 --> 00:59:10,246
Listen, Cookie O'Puss...

1079
00:59:10,246 --> 00:59:13,950
I got a leprechaun and I want some
gold or we're going to kill him.

1080
00:59:13,950 --> 00:59:16,851
How do you feel about
haVing your balls cut off?

1081
00:59:17,153 --> 00:59:19,212
Jeez, they're so into balls.

1082
00:59:19,622 --> 00:59:22,091
I'm serious. You better
make with the gold...

1083
00:59:22,091 --> 00:59:24,961
or your little green man will be
pushing up four-leaf clovers!

1084
00:59:24,961 --> 00:59:26,861
That was so good.
You sounded so tough.

1085
00:59:27,263 --> 00:59:28,525
Okay.

1086
00:59:30,333 --> 00:59:31,857
What did he say?

1087
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:34,036
He said "Okay."

1088
00:59:35,672 --> 00:59:38,072
No way. How did he get
here so fast?

1089
00:59:56,993 --> 00:59:58,085
Sweet!

1090
01:00:03,132 --> 01:00:06,329
- Gold coins!
- Gold!

1091
01:00:09,405 --> 01:00:11,930
- Happy Birthday, dude!
- Holy crap!

1092
01:00:12,041 --> 01:00:14,009
So, we get the gold and
we keep this little fucker?

1093
01:00:14,210 --> 01:00:17,145
Did you hear that? Looks like
your lucky charms just ran out.

1094
01:00:17,914 --> 01:00:20,280
Who's magically
delicious now, bitch?

1095
01:00:21,017 --> 01:00:22,585
What? Did you say something?

1096
01:00:22,585 --> 01:00:26,077
I couldn't hear you over my giant
pot of leprechaun gold!

1097
01:00:27,090 --> 01:00:28,387
Top o' the morning, ladies!

1098
01:00:31,227 --> 01:00:34,287
- He shot me in the eye!
- He shot me in my nipples!

1099
01:00:35,965 --> 01:00:37,990
I'm half goddamn blind!

1100
01:00:39,335 --> 01:00:41,098
Taste Celtic steel!

1101
01:00:43,039 --> 01:00:45,174
That's right, brother!
Fuck him up good!

1102
01:00:45,174 --> 01:00:48,044
This is what happens when
you take a leprechaun's gold!

1103
01:00:48,044 --> 01:00:51,014
Stab him with your leprechaun
knife! Cut off his balls!

1104
01:00:51,014 --> 01:00:52,382
Go leprechauns!

1105
01:00:52,382 --> 01:00:55,018
- Walk to the rainbow.
- What?

1106
01:00:55,018 --> 01:00:58,154
- Cut off his balls!
- Help! Pete! Help!

1107
01:00:58,154 --> 01:01:01,090
I'm going to mangle your balls!

1108
01:01:01,090 --> 01:01:03,524
Shoot him! Shoot
the fucking leprechaun!

1109
01:01:04,594 --> 01:01:07,196
You moron! Not that
leprechaun! This leprechaun!

1110
01:01:07,196 --> 01:01:09,994
Tell St. Patty you like it
up the ass!

1111
01:01:17,073 --> 01:01:18,165
What now?

1112
01:01:21,177 --> 01:01:22,612
Not much to these guys.

1113
01:01:22,612 --> 01:01:24,580
Yeah. I thought they'd be bigger.

1114
01:01:25,181 --> 01:01:27,615
Hey, Pete, I just want
to say thank you.

1115
01:01:28,051 --> 01:01:31,111
- Yeah, it is a lot of gold.
- Nah, it's more than gold.

1116
01:01:31,187 --> 01:01:33,289
Catching that leprechaun
must have been hard work.

1117
01:01:33,289 --> 01:01:36,156
Something that only a true
friend would do for me.

1118
01:01:36,359 --> 01:01:39,419
Yeah, well, I should have never
slept with your girlfriend.

1119
01:01:39,629 --> 01:01:42,154
Whatever. We can buy
new girlfriends.

1120
01:01:43,066 --> 01:01:46,169
Dude, I totally forgot
the second part of your gift!

1121
01:01:46,169 --> 01:01:47,136
Really?

1122
01:01:53,676 --> 01:01:57,043
- Who is she?
- She's a fairy. Storybook fairy.

1123
01:01:58,414 --> 01:02:00,882
What the hell am I supposed
to do with a fairy?

1124
01:02:01,084 --> 01:02:03,348
I suck cock for gold coins.

1125
01:02:07,457 --> 01:02:09,049
J.J., make some space!

1126
01:02:11,461 --> 01:02:14,089
- What can I do?
- I need metal. Right now! Go!

1127
01:02:15,264 --> 01:02:17,198
Use your Tinker Toys.

1128
01:02:17,633 --> 01:02:21,433
- Trophies! Spoons!
- Stop yelling at me! L'll do it!

1129
01:02:25,141 --> 01:02:28,311
- Right.
- I'm go. Initiate sequence.

1130
01:02:28,311 --> 01:02:29,545
Is this going to work?

1131
01:02:29,545 --> 01:02:30,569
Lt better!

1132
01:02:32,415 --> 01:02:33,575
Here we go!

1133
01:02:35,284 --> 01:02:36,581
How do you do this?

1134
01:02:38,521 --> 01:02:40,182
We're getting close!

1135
01:02:40,456 --> 01:02:41,514
Yeah?

1136
01:02:44,060 --> 01:02:45,584
Yes, we're getting very close!

1137
01:02:47,897 --> 01:02:49,626
Uno marguerita, por faVor?

1138
01:02:49,966 --> 01:02:51,058
You want salt?

1139
01:02:51,234 --> 01:02:52,394
Sí, bueno.

1140
01:02:53,236 --> 01:02:56,272
- And for you?
- Whynatte and rum, please.

1141
01:02:56,272 --> 01:02:57,398
Got it.

1142
01:02:58,107 --> 01:03:00,132
Do you mind me asking a question?
Lt may seem personal.

1143
01:03:00,443 --> 01:03:05,081
I'm quite surprised that a lady
with your face needs to resort to...

1144
01:03:05,081 --> 01:03:06,241
- Match dot com?
- Right.

1145
01:03:06,415 --> 01:03:11,254
Truth is, I have completely
exhausted all of my options.

1146
01:03:11,254 --> 01:03:12,288
- Really?
- Yeah.

1147
01:03:12,288 --> 01:03:14,657
Oh, dear. That's a shame.
And are you from the area?

1148
01:03:14,657 --> 01:03:16,292
No. Let's not do that, okay?

1149
01:03:16,292 --> 01:03:18,327
I've been on so many blind dates
in the past year,

1150
01:03:18,327 --> 01:03:19,555
and they're all the same.

1151
01:03:20,129 --> 01:03:22,064
"Where are you from?
What does your sister do?

1152
01:03:22,064 --> 01:03:23,166
What does your father..."
Blah, blah, blah.

1153
01:03:23,166 --> 01:03:25,168
Do you really care if my father
is a garbage man?

1154
01:03:25,168 --> 01:03:27,170
- Is your father a garbage man?
- No, he's not! That's the point.

1155
01:03:27,170 --> 01:03:28,538
- Who cares?
- Not important.

1156
01:03:28,538 --> 01:03:32,241
So let's not do that. Let's
have this date be different.

1157
01:03:32,241 --> 01:03:35,278
- Let's talk about real things, okay?
- Great.

1158
01:03:35,278 --> 01:03:38,042
- Real, straight conversations.
- I'm all about that.

1159
01:03:39,282 --> 01:03:40,943
So what does your father
do for a living?

1160
01:03:43,352 --> 01:03:46,116
Okay. Let's play a game.

1161
01:03:46,355 --> 01:03:48,024
- Okay.
- Have you played Truth or Dare?

1162
01:03:48,024 --> 01:03:49,492
I haven't played it,
but I'm aware of it.

1163
01:03:49,492 --> 01:03:53,087
Well, you start first.
You ask me, "Truth or Dare."

1164
01:03:53,362 --> 01:03:55,125
- Truth or Dare?
- Truth.

1165
01:03:55,364 --> 01:04:00,203
Is there any possibility
in this noble cosmos...

1166
01:04:00,203 --> 01:04:04,367
or any alternative parallel
cosmos where you might...

1167
01:04:05,208 --> 01:04:07,938
Is there any chance I'm your type?

1168
01:04:10,346 --> 01:04:12,280
Yeah. Yeah. You're tall.

1169
01:04:12,915 --> 01:04:14,542
- And that's good?
- I like tall.

1170
01:04:15,318 --> 01:04:16,352
Okay, Truth or Dare?

1171
01:04:16,352 --> 01:04:17,376
Truth?

1172
01:04:18,154 --> 01:04:22,147
I knew you'd say that. I am going to
push the limits just a little bit.

1173
01:04:22,992 --> 01:04:26,120
- Are you circumcised?
- Am I circumcised?

1174
01:04:26,195 --> 01:04:27,924
That's personal.

1175
01:04:29,031 --> 01:04:32,268
Circumcision has never really taken
off, to be honest, where I'm from.

1176
01:04:32,268 --> 01:04:35,533
It's not... it's not the vogue.

1177
01:04:36,205 --> 01:04:38,366
I tend to associate it
with Jewish people...

1178
01:04:38,941 --> 01:04:41,210
and we don't have many Jewish
people in Europe anymore...

1179
01:04:41,210 --> 01:04:43,913
because of the... trouble.

1180
01:04:43,913 --> 01:04:45,938
So, no, I'm not.

1181
01:04:46,382 --> 01:04:49,215
But if you would need me to get
circumcised, I'm sure I could.

1182
01:04:50,386 --> 01:04:52,547
- Truth or Dare?
- Truth.

1183
01:04:52,989 --> 01:04:55,258
When was the last time
you kissed a man?

1184
01:04:55,258 --> 01:04:59,319
Twenty-six days ago in an alley behind
a Pilates studio. Truth or Dare?

1185
01:05:00,196 --> 01:05:01,493
Dare. I'm going
to go with a Dare.

1186
01:05:02,198 --> 01:05:05,565
Here we go. Now we're
cooking. Okay.

1187
01:05:06,035 --> 01:05:09,596
I dare you to go over there.

1188
01:05:10,373 --> 01:05:13,409
See that man with the black
jacket? The husky guy?

1189
01:05:13,409 --> 01:05:16,245
I dare you to go
and pinch his ass.

1190
01:05:16,245 --> 01:05:18,347
- Do what now?
- Just cup it.

1191
01:05:18,347 --> 01:05:19,939
Grab his cheeks and cup it.

1192
01:05:20,983 --> 01:05:22,251
- No.
- Yeah.

1193
01:05:22,251 --> 01:05:24,654
You said Dare, not me.
That's what Dare is.

1194
01:05:24,654 --> 01:05:26,555
- Have a look at him. He's quite...
- I see him.

1195
01:05:26,555 --> 01:05:28,357
Go back there and cup his ass.

1196
01:05:28,357 --> 01:05:29,392
He's quite a stocky man.

1197
01:05:29,392 --> 01:05:31,494
- He might have a knife.
- I don't even have to be here.

1198
01:05:31,494 --> 01:05:34,130
I can go home and watch Family Guy
if you don't want to play.

1199
01:05:34,130 --> 01:05:35,164
L'll get the check.
Excuse me!

1200
01:05:35,164 --> 01:05:36,632
- Can I have the check?
- She doesn't need the check.

1201
01:05:36,632 --> 01:05:37,929
She's joking.

1202
01:05:38,234 --> 01:05:40,202
- Then go cup his ass.
- Okay, I will.

1203
01:05:49,345 --> 01:05:54,009
I call him, and he never answers
the phone. I'm sick of it.

1204
01:05:54,250 --> 01:05:56,343
- Go pay him a visit.
- You call him.

1205
01:05:58,988 --> 01:06:02,389
I'm sick and tired of it. It's...

1206
01:06:03,326 --> 01:06:05,428
- What the fuck?
- I did. Sorry.

1207
01:06:05,428 --> 01:06:08,397
You touching my fucking ass!
What's the matter with you!

1208
01:06:08,497 --> 01:06:11,467
- What do you mean, you? Fuck you!
- Sorry. Sorry.

1209
01:06:11,467 --> 01:06:14,637
- You touch the wrong ass, asshole!
- It's all good.

1210
01:06:14,637 --> 01:06:16,366
- What's the matter with you?
- Sorry. Apologies. Sorry.

1211
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:18,140
That was great!

1212
01:06:18,140 --> 01:06:20,309
Truth or Dare? Truth or Dare?

1213
01:06:20,309 --> 01:06:21,377
Wait a minute. Can I enjoy the...

1214
01:06:21,377 --> 01:06:23,504
Truth or Dare? Come on.

1215
01:06:23,646 --> 01:06:25,147
Okay. Dare.

1216
01:06:25,147 --> 01:06:26,949
Right. You go and cup his ass.

1217
01:06:26,949 --> 01:06:30,152
No. You can't dare me to do the
same thing I just dared you to do.

1218
01:06:30,152 --> 01:06:32,154
- Truth or Dare.
- Come up with your own dare.

1219
01:06:32,154 --> 01:06:33,143
Be original.

1220
01:06:34,523 --> 01:06:38,857
See that blind kid over there?
Blow out his candles before he can.

1221
01:06:40,329 --> 01:06:43,065
I can't do that! That's cruel!

1222
01:06:43,065 --> 01:06:44,333
Lt's Truth or Dare.
That's the rule.

1223
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:46,969
I could take off if you want.
I could go home.

1224
01:06:46,969 --> 01:06:49,505
L'll probably get home in time
to put Benny Hill DVDs on.

1225
01:06:49,505 --> 01:06:52,030
- You're doing that?
- It's up to you.

1226
01:06:52,341 --> 01:06:54,577
L'll go over there and
blow out the candles,

1227
01:06:54,577 --> 01:06:56,101
but you need to know something.

1228
01:06:56,379 --> 01:06:57,437
This is war.

1229
01:06:58,914 --> 01:07:02,213
I wish it was my birthday
So I could party, too

1230
01:07:02,485 --> 01:07:06,285
Happy, happy birthday
May all your dreams come true

1231
01:07:07,390 --> 01:07:09,925
Happy, happy birthday
From all of us to you

1232
01:07:09,925 --> 01:07:10,983
Hey!

1233
01:07:20,536 --> 01:07:22,902
Excuse me. I got $200.
Can you give me the whole thing?

1234
01:07:43,526 --> 01:07:46,495
I dare you to make guacamole
with your right breast.

1235
01:08:18,961 --> 01:08:21,486
"...elucidate several most important,
however...

1236
01:08:21,964 --> 01:08:25,401
intricate passages and scenes
hereafter to be painted."

1237
01:08:25,401 --> 01:08:28,336
Chapter 64: Stubb's Supper.

1238
01:08:28,404 --> 01:08:31,396
"Stubb's whale had been killed
some distance from the ship."

1239
01:08:38,581 --> 01:08:41,379
When the swelling goes down,
you're going to look great, Emily.

1240
01:08:42,251 --> 01:08:43,513
Thanks, sweetie.

1241
01:09:00,603 --> 01:09:04,240
- That was fun, huh?
- Yes. I had a really great time.

1242
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:05,366
Yeah? Me, too.

1243
01:09:05,608 --> 01:09:08,577
- It was definitely interesting.
- Yeah. We did a lot.

1244
01:09:08,577 --> 01:09:11,546
Yes. Yeah. We did. We did.

1245
01:09:11,981 --> 01:09:13,482
- We did it up.
- Yes.

1246
01:09:13,482 --> 01:09:16,417
It was enchanting.
You're really a...

1247
01:09:17,586 --> 01:09:19,213
very delightful woman.

1248
01:09:19,455 --> 01:09:20,922
- Well, thank you.
- Yeah.

1249
01:09:21,190 --> 01:09:22,350
So... Yeah.

1250
01:09:23,559 --> 01:09:27,120
This is that slightly
awkward moment.

1251
01:09:27,563 --> 01:09:28,552
Well...

1252
01:09:29,498 --> 01:09:31,363
No. I'm sorry.

1253
01:09:31,967 --> 01:09:35,437
You're sweet, really, and
I really did have a good time...

1254
01:09:35,437 --> 01:09:39,430
but I'm just not that attracted
to Asian men.

1255
01:09:48,984 --> 01:09:51,452
Psych! Get in here, Yao Ming!

1256
01:09:51,620 --> 01:09:54,180
We don't want these puppies
to go to waste.

1257
01:10:02,398 --> 01:10:03,490
Dude...

1258
01:10:04,133 --> 01:10:05,532
We're getting closer!

1259
01:10:07,203 --> 01:10:10,104
- I need one more!
- I'm freaking out, man!

1260
01:10:19,882 --> 01:10:22,851
Terrapin Protocol initiated.

1261
01:10:23,886 --> 01:10:25,221
I haVe failed.

1262
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:27,523
You haVe found MoVie 43.

1263
01:10:27,523 --> 01:10:29,457
- What the fuck did you do?
- MoVie 43.

1264
01:10:30,893 --> 01:10:32,383
I used to be great
cameraman in Russia.

1265
01:10:32,528 --> 01:10:34,587
Dude, what's up with the power?

1266
01:10:35,164 --> 01:10:36,899
Mission accomplished.

1267
01:10:36,899 --> 01:10:40,002
- We don't haVe much time.
- You little shit!

1268
01:10:40,002 --> 01:10:41,526
We found Movie 43, buddy.

1269
01:10:43,439 --> 01:10:45,498
Good. We found it.

1270
01:10:47,576 --> 01:10:49,545
The fuck? Dude, that's you!

1271
01:10:49,545 --> 01:10:51,480
My name is Baxter Cutler.

1272
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:54,583
It has been 1 41 days
since The Darkness.

1273
01:10:54,583 --> 01:10:59,486
J.J., CalVin and Baxter,
this is MoVie 43!

1274
01:10:59,922 --> 01:11:03,325
You see, when you idiots made
me search for MoVie 43...

1275
01:11:03,325 --> 01:11:07,496
we triggered the Terrapin Protocol,
the top-secret Cold War initiatiVe...

1276
01:11:07,496 --> 01:11:09,965
to control the mind
of every American citizen.

1277
01:11:09,965 --> 01:11:12,334
So that in the event
of a SoViet attack...

1278
01:11:12,334 --> 01:11:16,361
every man, woman and child would
be conVerted into fighting machines.

1279
01:11:16,538 --> 01:11:19,008
Only there were no more
SoViets to fight.

1280
01:11:19,008 --> 01:11:22,511
So everyone turned on each other
and now the country is in ruins.

1281
01:11:22,511 --> 01:11:24,945
China? Gone! Russia? Gone!

1282
01:11:25,180 --> 01:11:28,513
Amsterdam? Still not
a goddamn country! Gone!

1283
01:11:29,285 --> 01:11:31,920
That is why I'm sending
this message back in time.

1284
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:34,023
Baxter, listen to me.
You need to hack into...

1285
01:11:34,023 --> 01:11:35,591
Boss, the perimeter's clear!

1286
01:11:35,591 --> 01:11:39,357
Son of a bitch, J. J! I'm trying
to rewrite the fucking past!

1287
01:11:39,895 --> 01:11:43,160
Yeah? Some Infecteds were trying
to rewrite your fucking existence!

1288
01:11:43,532 --> 01:11:44,521
Two got away.

1289
01:11:45,901 --> 01:11:47,336
One did not.

1290
01:11:47,336 --> 01:11:49,938
Oh, man, this is sick!
Where am I?

1291
01:11:49,938 --> 01:11:51,565
Has the cripple been fed?

1292
01:11:51,940 --> 01:11:55,978
I'm sorry, Mommy!
I'm sorry, Mom!

1293
01:11:55,978 --> 01:11:57,502
Why am I Rain Man?

1294
01:11:57,613 --> 01:11:59,581
Make Sitara feed him.

1295
01:11:59,581 --> 01:12:02,284
You fucking feed him!
I need to be out slaughtering.

1296
01:12:02,284 --> 01:12:04,386
No! You carry my seed.

1297
01:12:04,386 --> 01:12:07,156
You must stay here where it's safe,
where I can protect you.

1298
01:12:07,156 --> 01:12:09,147
- I'm sorry!
- Come here, Mama.

1299
01:12:11,660 --> 01:12:13,218
- Sorry, Mommy.
- Back to business.

1300
01:12:13,562 --> 01:12:16,932
Security breach! Security breach!
Commence eVasiVe maneuVers.

1301
01:12:16,932 --> 01:12:19,423
- DefensiVe maneuVers!
- Dammit, they jumped the wire!

1302
01:12:19,601 --> 01:12:23,560
VrankoVich!
On me, you dumb Ruskie!

1303
01:12:24,006 --> 01:12:25,941
Baxter! You can prevent
this from happening!

1304
01:12:25,941 --> 01:12:28,210
Hack into the Department
of Defense security mainframe...

1305
01:12:28,210 --> 01:12:31,941
using a Mark-7 Spartan from
the Bundesnachrichtendienst...

1306
01:12:37,219 --> 01:12:38,921
- No way!
- Oh, shit!

1307
01:12:38,921 --> 01:12:42,379
- That was awesome!
- No way!

1308
01:12:42,524 --> 01:12:44,426
Dude! No way! I'm never
making fun of you again. Period.

1309
01:12:44,426 --> 01:12:46,195
We were trying to prank you!
You turned that around...

1310
01:12:46,195 --> 01:12:47,628
I swear it wasn't a prank!

1311
01:12:47,996 --> 01:12:50,399
Oh, my God. You're
expecting me to believe...

1312
01:12:50,399 --> 01:12:52,634
that somehow in the next
six months the whole world ends...

1313
01:12:52,634 --> 01:12:55,535
- and I'm a drooling cripple?
- I didn't do it!

1314
01:12:56,038 --> 01:12:57,072
What are you?

1315
01:12:57,072 --> 01:12:58,574
What's with the lights?
That was weird.

1316
01:12:58,574 --> 01:13:00,633
I'm going to the supermarket.
Does anyone need anything?

1317
01:13:06,248 --> 01:13:07,215
No.

1318
01:13:07,649 --> 01:13:09,173
What is it?

1319
01:13:15,657 --> 01:13:17,852
No!

1320
01:13:18,394 --> 01:13:21,591
- I'm sorry, Mommy! I'm sorry!
- What are you sorry about?

1321
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:26,864
- What's happening?
- Shit!

1322
01:13:28,270 --> 01:13:29,464
God!

1323
01:13:30,906 --> 01:13:33,942
I can fix this! Mark-7 Spartan!

1324
01:13:33,942 --> 01:13:36,912
That computer's fried. Go get
my laptop out of my room!

1325
01:13:36,912 --> 01:13:39,142
All right, I got it! I got it.
Don't worry.

1326
01:13:39,314 --> 01:13:42,477
- Don't let him pull his own dick off.
- Why would he pull his own dick off?

1327
01:13:43,118 --> 01:13:44,608
I fucking got it! I got it!

1328
01:13:48,924 --> 01:13:50,983
Why is my computer so slow?

1329
01:13:54,396 --> 01:13:56,626
Why is there porn on my computer?

1330
01:13:56,999 --> 01:13:58,193
April Fools.

1331
01:13:58,300 --> 01:14:00,029
Oh, shit!

1332
01:14:48,984 --> 01:14:50,076
I can't believe it!

1333
01:15:44,006 --> 01:15:48,243
In 1959, Kenny Jackson coached
the Ellison High Journeymen...

1334
01:15:48,243 --> 01:15:50,646
to become the first Negro
high school team...

1335
01:15:50,646 --> 01:15:52,876
ever to compete for a state title.

1336
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:55,308
Theirs was Victory's glory.

1337
01:15:56,618 --> 01:15:59,621
Come on, y'all. Why y'all still sitting
here? The game's all about to start.

1338
01:15:59,621 --> 01:16:01,919
Coach, we scared.

1339
01:16:02,658 --> 01:16:07,152
There's 10,000 white people out there
that think that we ain't good enough.

1340
01:16:08,664 --> 01:16:11,531
You know what?
Maybe we ain't.

1341
01:16:12,234 --> 01:16:13,997
All of y'all feel like that?

1342
01:16:14,937 --> 01:16:16,962
Four hundred years in this country...

1343
01:16:17,573 --> 01:16:21,907
the black man has been
spit on, kicked...

1344
01:16:23,011 --> 01:16:24,478
drug through the mud.

1345
01:16:25,047 --> 01:16:27,208
But I've got two things
I can tell you.

1346
01:16:28,150 --> 01:16:31,950
Number one, win or lose...

1347
01:16:33,155 --> 01:16:35,089
I am so proud of y'all.

1348
01:16:37,025 --> 01:16:38,390
Number two...

1349
01:16:40,028 --> 01:16:42,053
You're going to win.

1350
01:16:43,198 --> 01:16:45,223
It's just that plain
and fucking simple.

1351
01:16:45,434 --> 01:16:47,265
You're going to win!

1352
01:16:48,103 --> 01:16:49,571
But them white boys
from Hickory Tech...

1353
01:16:49,571 --> 01:16:52,039
- What game are we playing?
- Basketball, Coach.

1354
01:16:52,307 --> 01:16:53,968
What color is their skin?

1355
01:16:54,076 --> 01:16:56,178
- White.
- Exactly!

1356
01:16:56,178 --> 01:16:58,043
They're white, you're black.

1357
01:16:58,547 --> 01:17:00,014
This is basketball...

1358
01:17:01,049 --> 01:17:02,618
Am I speaking fucking Chinese?

1359
01:17:02,618 --> 01:17:05,587
Come on, people.
You guys are 25 and 0.

1360
01:17:05,587 --> 01:17:08,112
Yeah, Coach, but that was
against all-black teams.

1361
01:17:08,557 --> 01:17:12,160
That's the point! Y'all are going
to kill those Caucasians!

1362
01:17:12,160 --> 01:17:14,363
But, Coach, look at
their fundamentals.

1363
01:17:14,363 --> 01:17:17,127
The fundamentals!
Lt doesn't matter!

1364
01:17:17,432 --> 01:17:22,204
Lt's all the same when you're some
cement-foot troglodyte white boy...

1365
01:17:22,204 --> 01:17:25,207
getting dunked on with a big pair
of black fucking nuts...

1366
01:17:25,207 --> 01:17:27,142
hanging on your forehead!

1367
01:17:27,142 --> 01:17:29,144
Speaking of nuts...
Lucious.

1368
01:17:29,144 --> 01:17:30,577
Come on up here, Lucious.

1369
01:17:32,214 --> 01:17:34,444
Tell them.
How long is your dick?

1370
01:17:35,217 --> 01:17:37,048
I don't know, Coach. Like a foot.

1371
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:40,012
Foot and a half.

1372
01:17:40,188 --> 01:17:41,177
Foot and a ha...

1373
01:17:43,458 --> 01:17:45,016
Foot and a half?

1374
01:17:45,994 --> 01:17:48,063
Their arm ain't even that long!

1375
01:17:48,063 --> 01:17:52,056
All right, let's kick some butt.
You scared?

1376
01:17:52,234 --> 01:17:54,225
Well, well, well.

1377
01:17:55,103 --> 01:17:57,139
You Negroes going
to play basketball, or what?

1378
01:17:57,139 --> 01:18:00,233
Yeah, you Negroes.
What's the matter?

1379
01:18:00,442 --> 01:18:04,173
Did you realize you didn't belong
in a white man's game, you Negroes?

1380
01:18:04,246 --> 01:18:06,882
That's right. This isn't
a game for Negroes.

1381
01:18:06,882 --> 01:18:11,219
It's a game for good, honest
white people, not for Negroes.

1382
01:18:11,219 --> 01:18:13,050
You understand, Negroes?

1383
01:18:14,222 --> 01:18:17,919
- White Knights!
- White Knights!

1384
01:18:19,895 --> 01:18:21,229
Man, Coach, they looked tough.

1385
01:18:21,229 --> 01:18:23,432
"They looked tough"?
I'm so scared!

1386
01:18:23,432 --> 01:18:25,067
You know what they might do?

1387
01:18:25,067 --> 01:18:28,503
One of them might dribble
with his left hand...

1388
01:18:28,503 --> 01:18:31,239
all the way down the lane and then
go up for a left-handed layup...

1389
01:18:31,239 --> 01:18:33,230
and you know what's going
to happen then?

1390
01:18:33,942 --> 01:18:37,070
Your black ass is going
to swat that shit...

1391
01:18:37,245 --> 01:18:42,284
jump over his cracker ass, and
dunk in his goddamn face!

1392
01:18:42,284 --> 01:18:45,287
How many fucking times
do I have to tell you?

1393
01:18:45,287 --> 01:18:49,485
You're black, they're white,
this ain't hockey!

1394
01:18:50,158 --> 01:18:54,925
Guys, I think what Coach is trying to
say is that the key word is "teamwork."

1395
01:18:55,297 --> 01:19:00,234
No, the key word is
"you're black, they're white"!

1396
01:19:00,936 --> 01:19:03,505
So, Coach, what you're saying is,
if we just walk with the Lord...

1397
01:19:03,505 --> 01:19:06,141
The Lord? Nigger, the Lord
done did his part already!

1398
01:19:06,141 --> 01:19:09,269
He made you black.
He made them white.

1399
01:19:09,578 --> 01:19:13,275
He gave you a foot-and-a-half dick!
Dribble with that motherfucker!

1400
01:19:14,549 --> 01:19:16,983
As long as y'all are out
there on the floor...

1401
01:19:17,285 --> 01:19:19,988
you're going to score more
points than them.

1402
01:19:19,988 --> 01:19:22,149
That's just how basketball works!

1403
01:19:27,295 --> 01:19:30,526
Cut that goddamn
slow clap shit out!

1404
01:19:30,632 --> 01:19:33,100
Tries my motherfucking patience!

1405
01:19:33,368 --> 01:19:35,131
Go out there and win!

1406
01:19:36,204 --> 01:19:38,195
- Let's go!
- Come on!

1407
01:20:05,367 --> 01:20:07,494
Lt was a glorious game.

1408
01:20:08,370 --> 01:20:10,372
But late in the fourth quarter...

1409
01:20:10,372 --> 01:20:14,276
when Lucious Williams dribbled
the entire length of the court...

1410
01:20:14,276 --> 01:20:16,369
with his foot-and-a-half penis...

1411
01:20:16,645 --> 01:20:20,206
the referees had no choice
but to call a technical foul...

1412
01:20:20,916 --> 01:20:24,352
sending young Bobby Lee Mayflower
to the line...

1413
01:20:24,586 --> 01:20:27,919
for the most dramatic
moment of the contest.

1414
01:20:51,046 --> 01:20:52,280
Hey, guys. Hello.

1415
01:20:52,280 --> 01:20:53,941
Who is that woman you are with?

1416
01:20:54,216 --> 01:20:55,584
That's my mother.

1417
01:20:55,584 --> 01:20:57,313
I want your mother.

1418
01:21:01,022 --> 01:21:03,252
- Baxter, turn that shit off, man.
- Okay.

1419
01:21:04,392 --> 01:21:05,859
I'm going to go to
the bathroom, all right?

1420
01:21:12,434 --> 01:21:14,026
I can't fucking do it.

1421
01:21:14,302 --> 01:21:17,138
- I don't know, but I been told
- I don't know, but I been told

1422
01:21:17,138 --> 01:21:18,406
Gym class giVes you great big balls

1423
01:21:18,406 --> 01:21:19,395
Gym class giVes you...

1424
01:21:23,111 --> 01:21:24,379
Out here shooting the shit.

1425
01:21:24,379 --> 01:21:28,213
Some guys shoot the shit, and some
people get shot with shit. Right?

1426
01:21:28,383 --> 01:21:30,442
- Am I right?
- I don't know what he's talking about.

1427
01:21:30,652 --> 01:21:32,287
You know what the fuck
I'm talking about.

1428
01:21:32,287 --> 01:21:34,221
I want to be on you.

1429
01:21:35,290 --> 01:21:36,621
In you.

1430
01:21:38,660 --> 01:21:40,355
- Sorry. Fuck.
- Not a problem.

1431
01:21:46,468 --> 01:21:47,435
No.

1432
01:21:48,536 --> 01:21:51,130
No, I can just see him
underneath the table.

1433
01:21:52,374 --> 01:21:54,467
And he's had his fingers in
my pussy for the last five minutes.

1434
01:21:54,910 --> 01:21:58,243
It's monstrous. It looks like she's
sitting on Art Garfunkel's shoulders.

1435
01:22:06,421 --> 01:22:09,322
No one leaves this room
till we figure this out.

1436
01:22:11,359 --> 01:22:13,428
Mangled dicks. Mangled...

1437
01:22:13,428 --> 01:22:15,630
Dicks, dicks, dicks, dicks...

1438
01:22:15,630 --> 01:22:18,266
- Mangled dicks.
- Mangled dicks. Mangled...

1439
01:22:18,266 --> 01:22:20,325
- Dicks.
- Dicks.

1440
01:22:20,468 --> 01:22:22,070
I got frozen peas and a sponge.

1441
01:22:22,070 --> 01:22:24,306
No, Mikey, there's steel
wool on one side.

1442
01:22:24,306 --> 01:22:25,440
Shit, you're right.

1443
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:28,076
Okay, Amanda, you're going to want
to keep the yellow side up.

1444
01:22:28,076 --> 01:22:29,941
Otherwise, there's going
to be lots more blood.

1445
01:22:38,386 --> 01:22:40,354
I suck cock for gold coins.

1446
01:22:41,923 --> 01:22:43,356
So do I.

1447
01:22:56,171 --> 01:22:59,107
So what you're saying is, if we go
out there and give 1 10 percent...

1448
01:22:59,107 --> 01:23:02,344
A hundred and ten percent!
Fifty percent! Three percent!

1449
01:23:02,344 --> 01:23:05,472
I think what Coach is trying to say is
that the key word here is "teamwork."

1450
01:23:05,647 --> 01:23:09,105
Lucious, will you whip out your dick
and smack this motherfucker with it?

1451
01:23:10,618 --> 01:23:12,354
- What?
- I love you even more.

1452
01:23:12,354 --> 01:23:14,345
- Oh, Anson.
- I do.

1453
01:23:14,889 --> 01:23:16,447
- Me, too.
- You do?

1454
01:23:21,896 --> 01:23:24,956
He's America's faVorite cat...
Beezel

1455
01:23:31,406 --> 01:23:33,375
I'm embarrassed to even
say this, but...

1456
01:23:33,375 --> 01:23:34,467
What?

1457
01:23:35,310 --> 01:23:37,369
Amy, ever since you moved
in here, l...

1458
01:23:38,546 --> 01:23:40,382
- What?
- I love you even more.

1459
01:23:40,382 --> 01:23:42,316
- Oh, Anson.
- I do.

1460
01:23:42,384 --> 01:23:44,215
- Me, too.
- You do?

1461
01:23:47,589 --> 01:23:50,080
Beezel! How are you?

1462
01:23:50,558 --> 01:23:52,924
How is my handsome little boy?

1463
01:23:58,933 --> 01:24:03,405
Hey, Anson, do you ever feel like
your relationship with Beezel...

1464
01:24:03,405 --> 01:24:05,168
is a little strange?

1465
01:24:05,573 --> 01:24:06,540
Amy!

1466
01:24:07,442 --> 01:24:09,310
Please don't tell me
you're one of those girls...

1467
01:24:09,310 --> 01:24:11,210
that gets jealous of a guy's pet!

1468
01:24:11,379 --> 01:24:14,405
Even if that pet is thuper thilly!

1469
01:24:14,949 --> 01:24:18,520
No, no. I just don't think
he likes me very much.

1470
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:21,189
Come on, Amy. He loves you!

1471
01:24:21,189 --> 01:24:22,520
- Really?
- Yeah.

1472
01:24:23,224 --> 01:24:24,350
There we go.

1473
01:24:26,628 --> 01:24:28,220
Now, where were we?

1474
01:24:37,472 --> 01:24:38,871
What's wrong?

1475
01:24:41,476 --> 01:24:42,465
Nothing.

1476
01:25:29,591 --> 01:25:31,559
Get off of me!

1477
01:25:58,553 --> 01:26:00,248
- What happened?
- Beezel...

1478
01:26:00,622 --> 01:26:03,455
pissed all over me!

1479
01:26:03,892 --> 01:26:05,860
Oh, no, he just sprayed you.

1480
01:26:06,027 --> 01:26:09,564
It's something male cats do sometimes.
It means he likes you.

1481
01:26:09,564 --> 01:26:11,499
- He likes me?
- Yeah.

1482
01:26:11,499 --> 01:26:14,525
Or it could mean that he's sick.
Buddy, are you sick?

1483
01:26:14,636 --> 01:26:17,272
Anson, he did this on purpose!

1484
01:26:17,272 --> 01:26:20,975
- I caught him masturbating.
- He was probably just cleaning himself.

1485
01:26:20,975 --> 01:26:24,546
It was to pictures of you
in a swimsuit!

1486
01:26:24,546 --> 01:26:27,048
Cats can't even process
images in that way.

1487
01:26:27,048 --> 01:26:29,584
But he is not a normal cat.

1488
01:26:29,584 --> 01:26:30,885
Of course he is.

1489
01:26:30,885 --> 01:26:33,945
He just put a fucking
thermometer in his mouth!

1490
01:26:34,189 --> 01:26:35,520
He thinks it's a toy.

1491
01:26:40,295 --> 01:26:41,557
Oh, Beezel.

1492
01:26:43,531 --> 01:26:45,533
Anson. I love you.

1493
01:26:45,533 --> 01:26:48,536
I do, but as long as that
little fucker is around...

1494
01:26:48,536 --> 01:26:50,060
I cannot be with you.

1495
01:26:50,271 --> 01:26:52,535
No, Amy, Amy. Look.

1496
01:26:53,908 --> 01:26:56,444
If it'll make you happy,
l'll find another home for Beezel.

1497
01:26:56,444 --> 01:26:57,570
He's just a cat.

1498
01:26:58,880 --> 01:26:59,972
But you...

1499
01:27:01,216 --> 01:27:02,581
you're the woman that I love.

1500
01:27:04,485 --> 01:27:07,318
- You'd get rid of him?
- I will.

1501
01:27:07,622 --> 01:27:09,390
- I love you.
- I love you.

1502
01:27:09,390 --> 01:27:10,550
No, I love you.

1503
01:27:34,415 --> 01:27:36,906
Beezel, where are you, boy?

1504
01:27:37,252 --> 01:27:39,186
Come out, come out,
you little rat-fucker.

1505
01:27:40,054 --> 01:27:41,316
Beezel!

1506
01:27:42,991 --> 01:27:46,361
Shit, I told my mother we'd
have him there in an hour.

1507
01:27:46,361 --> 01:27:48,921
She was nice enough
to take him off our hands.

1508
01:27:49,330 --> 01:27:51,992
- Do you mind checking outside for him?
- Absolutely.

1509
01:27:52,333 --> 01:27:53,561
I'm going to go upstairs.

1510
01:27:56,638 --> 01:27:57,969
Beezel?

1511
01:28:34,008 --> 01:28:37,444
That's it, you son of a bitch!

1512
01:28:41,015 --> 01:28:42,983
Cock-sucking...

1513
01:28:43,885 --> 01:28:45,653
motherfucking...

1514
01:28:45,653 --> 01:28:48,417
Garfield reject piece of shit!

1515
01:28:52,060 --> 01:28:54,187
Die, you...

1516
01:28:55,063 --> 01:28:57,896
dick-loving devil cat!

1517
01:29:05,406 --> 01:29:08,000
What?

1518
01:29:09,677 --> 01:29:10,974
Don't look.

1519
01:29:11,379 --> 01:29:14,143
Mommy, she's beating that cat...

1520
01:29:14,916 --> 01:29:15,940
to death!

1521
01:29:17,218 --> 01:29:18,879
He tried to kill me.

1522
01:29:19,253 --> 01:29:21,050
No, you don't understand.

1523
01:29:21,389 --> 01:29:23,880
You don't understand.

1524
01:29:27,895 --> 01:29:29,260
Please.

1525
01:29:31,366 --> 01:29:32,856
Get her!
