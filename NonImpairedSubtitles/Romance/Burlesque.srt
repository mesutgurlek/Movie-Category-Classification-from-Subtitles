1
00:00:26,944 --> 00:00:30,345
Sixteen-fifty for you, 16:50 for me.

2
00:00:36,454 --> 00:00:37,785
Loretta, I'm leaving.

3
00:00:37,955 --> 00:00:39,286
What do you mean?

4
00:00:39,724 --> 00:00:41,453
Soon as I get my check, I'm gone.

5
00:00:43,761 --> 00:00:44,853
I'll be back.

6
00:00:45,029 --> 00:00:46,713
Dwight, I need my
check before you leave.

7
00:00:46,714 --> 00:00:48,396
Payday's at the end of the month.

8
00:00:48,566 --> 00:00:50,128
You still haven't paid us
for last month.

9
00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:52,195
I need my money,
Loretta's got a kid to feed.

10
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:53,431
Hey, you got a problem
with management?

11
00:00:53,432 --> 00:00:55,567
Put a note in the suggestion box.

12
00:00:55,973 --> 00:00:59,431
- Dwight! I'm serious. I'm quitting.
- I'll be back for the dinner shift.

13
00:01:01,579 --> 00:01:03,410
I sure as hell won't be.

14
00:01:07,151 --> 00:01:08,209
What are you doing?

15
00:01:08,386 --> 00:01:10,820
I'm only taking what he owes me,
not a penny more.

16
00:01:10,988 --> 00:01:13,479
You take that money,
he's gonna come after you.

17
00:01:14,291 --> 00:01:16,418
- He's gotta find me first.
- What're you gonna do?

18
00:01:17,395 --> 00:01:20,228
This ought to cover that bike you've
been wanting to get for little Keith.

19
00:01:20,398 --> 00:01:22,161
You're late to pick him up
from school.

20
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,559
Go. I got everything covered here.

21
00:01:24,735 --> 00:01:25,929
You're really going?

22
00:01:26,103 --> 00:01:27,661
I'm really going.

23
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,074
That bike can wait till Christmas.

24
00:01:32,243 --> 00:01:35,508
You keep what he owes you.
I'll deal with Dwight, okay?

25
00:01:38,282 --> 00:01:39,681
See you later.

Come on. You're on, you're on.

00:06:51,395 --> 00:06:52,760
We may not have windows...

65
00:06:53,197 --> 00:06:56,564
...but we do have the best view
on Sunset Strip.

66
00:06:58,602 --> 00:06:59,626
Twenty bucks.

67
00:07:00,104 --> 00:07:01,901
What is this place, a strip club?

68
00:07:02,072 --> 00:07:03,096
"Strip club"?

69
00:07:03,741 --> 00:07:06,335
Honey, I should wash your mouth out
with the Jägermeister.

70
00:07:06,744 --> 00:07:09,941
The only Pole you'll find in there
is Natasha, the short girl.

71
00:07:18,822 --> 00:07:21,017
Baby cakes, I got a club to fill here.

Right, sorry.

- Welcome to L.A.
- Thank you.

You wanna do your job? Let's go.

than me? Yeah.

Ask for Tess.

120
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,212
- She's your guy. Flirt away.
- Thanks.

121
00:11:06,383 --> 00:11:07,714
- Iowa.
- Yeah?

your boyfriend is so cute.

So tonight, takeout and a movie?

Both.

133

- Casablanca and Oreos.
- Yes.

Tess! I lost a contact on the stage.

135
00:11:41,685 --> 00:11:44,779
Okay, if you fall off the stage,
leg extended, boobs up.

139
00:11:50,794 --> 00:11:52,159
Come here, give me.

140
00:11:52,329 --> 00:11:53,853
- Wait.
- What? The foot?

141
00:11:54,031 --> 00:11:56,261
Yeah, the foot, the back, the neck.

142
00:11:56,433 --> 00:11:59,197
The hips, the breasts, the face...

143
00:11:59,936 --> 00:12:02,598
Vince, the sink's busted
upstairs again.

144
00:12:02,773 --> 00:12:04,900
I'm not calling a plumber, Coco.

145
00:12:05,909 --> 00:12:08,776
Tess, have you read this letter
from the bank?

146
00:12:08,945 --> 00:12:12,403
Vincent, how many times have I told
you no business during business hours.

147
00:12:12,582 --> 00:12:15,574
- Marcus Gerber is coming in tonight.
- So what?

148
00:12:15,752 --> 00:12:17,481
This isn't going away.

149
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:20,714
You won't talk to me before the show,
you won't talk to me after the show.

150
00:12:20,891 --> 00:12:22,449
It's like you're avoiding me.

151
00:12:22,626 --> 00:12:25,151
Well, I didn't divorce you
to spend more time with you.

152
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:29,059
I may not be "Mr. Tess" anymore,
but I still own half this place.

153
00:12:29,266 --> 00:12:30,733
"Mr. Tess."

154
00:12:31,268 --> 00:12:32,565
That is so hot.

155
00:12:32,736 --> 00:12:35,534
Nice, but it won't pay the bills.

156
00:12:36,106 --> 00:12:37,630
Wait. Wait. Zip me up.

157
00:12:38,108 --> 00:12:40,406
Excuse me, I'm looking for Tess.

158
00:12:44,481 --> 00:12:45,812
Hi, are you Tess?

159
00:12:46,783 --> 00:12:48,580
And you are in my mirror because?

160
00:12:49,119 --> 00:12:52,282
Oh, sorry. I'm friends with Jack,
and I'm looking for a job.

161
00:12:52,923 --> 00:12:54,322
And where have you danced?

162
00:12:54,491 --> 00:12:56,982
At home, mostly. But I can move.

163
00:12:57,661 --> 00:12:59,720
Okay, give your name
and number to Sean

164
00:12:59,896 --> 00:13:02,194
and he'll let you know when
we're having our next audition.

165
00:13:02,566 --> 00:13:03,999
When will that be, exactly?

166
00:13:04,434 --> 00:13:05,526
Sean?

167
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:09,001
- Honey! Where the hell is Nikki?
- I don't know. She's late again.

168
00:13:09,172 --> 00:13:11,037
Oh, I'm never late. Ever.

169
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:12,232
Alright, that's great.

170
00:13:12,409 --> 00:13:14,590
Listen darling, we're trying
to put on a show here, okay.

171
00:13:14,591 --> 00:13:15,698
So maybe come back another time.

172
00:13:15,812 --> 00:13:17,780
I've just never seen anything
like this before.

173
00:13:17,948 --> 00:13:19,746
I need a job and I wanna work here.

174
00:13:19,747 --> 00:13:21,543
Great enthusiasm,
terrible timing, alright.

175
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:23,638
So leave your name and
your number with Jack,

176
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:25,387
your friend downstairs, okay.

177
00:13:25,589 --> 00:13:27,784
And we'll call you. Okay? Promise.

178
00:13:29,993 --> 00:13:31,517
Hey, can you fix this for me?

179
00:13:31,695 --> 00:13:33,322
Let's move it, ladies!

180
00:13:35,132 --> 00:13:37,657
- Hello.
- Oh, my God. Nikki.

181
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:40,896
You know, you're probably not
gonna believe this...

182
00:13:41,071 --> 00:13:43,505
...but Sean and I were just talking
about you, and he said...

183
00:13:43,673 --> 00:13:45,903
I said, "It's so sad that Nikki

184
00:13:45,904 --> 00:13:48,133
couldn't join us for
the opening number...

185
00:13:48,311 --> 00:13:51,678
..but it would be so great if she stop
by and joined us for the next one."

186
00:13:52,115 --> 00:13:55,380
Paws and claws.
Took longer than I thought.

187
00:13:55,552 --> 00:13:57,713
And so is finding a new job
when I fire you, late ass.

188
00:13:57,888 --> 00:13:59,014
Yeah, right.

189
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:00,548
- Get ready.
- Yeah.

190
00:14:00,891 --> 00:14:02,859
Hey. Bring me a Martini.

191
00:14:03,026 --> 00:14:05,017
Extra dry, straight up, three olives.

192
00:14:05,195 --> 00:14:07,561
- And hurry back.
- She doesn't work here, Nikki.

193
00:14:07,731 --> 00:14:08,993
Well, then she's not busy.

194
00:14:12,636 --> 00:14:14,729
Twenty minutes and we're back.

195
00:14:14,905 --> 00:14:17,373
Did your mama ever tell you
it's not polite to stare?

196
00:14:17,741 --> 00:14:20,039
You're just so damn beautiful, I-

197
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:23,879
Well, in that case, screw your mama
and stare away.

198
00:14:24,047 --> 00:14:25,947
No one would ever know.

199
00:14:26,149 --> 00:14:27,207
Know what?

200
00:14:27,384 --> 00:14:28,442
That you're a dude.

201
00:14:30,687 --> 00:14:32,211
- God.
- Can I use this?

202
00:14:33,023 --> 00:14:35,719
Goddamn it! Don't touch my stuff!

203
00:14:36,526 --> 00:14:37,925
Hey, waitress!

204
00:14:38,361 --> 00:14:39,988
Sweetheart? Hey, over here.

205
00:14:40,163 --> 00:14:41,187
One second.

206
00:14:48,505 --> 00:14:49,665
Yo!

207
00:14:52,108 --> 00:14:53,803
- Ladies?
- I'll have a vodka.

208
00:14:54,311 --> 00:14:55,801
What can I get you?

209
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:01,244
One shot of Patrón...

210
00:15:01,418 --> 00:15:05,081
...and tough guy with the hat
over there, he wants a Cosmo.

211
00:15:05,856 --> 00:15:07,483
- What are you doing?
- One night.

212
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:09,386
If I'm not 20 times better
than boobs-for-brains,

213
00:15:09,387 --> 00:15:11,115
you don't have to pay me.

214
00:15:28,829 --> 00:15:33,856
<i># A kiss on the hand may be
quite continental</i>

215
00:15:34,275 --> 00:15:37,440
<i># But diamonds
are a girl's best friend</i>

216
00:15:39,344 --> 00:15:41,135
<i># A kiss may be grand-</i>

217
00:15:41,658 --> 00:15:44,092
Isn't that the girl that was
backstage just a moment?

218
00:15:45,061 --> 00:15:46,085
I think so.

219
00:15:46,263 --> 00:15:49,130
Hey, Jack, what's she doing here?

220
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:51,266
She really wanted a job.

221
00:15:51,434 --> 00:15:54,562
And so she is our new waitress.

222
00:15:54,738 --> 00:15:57,468
And when did I make you
Head of Personnel?

223
00:15:57,674 --> 00:16:00,336
She just picked up a tray,
started working.

224
00:16:00,677 --> 00:16:02,975
- Really?
- Well, her name is Ali.

225
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:04,672
Ali.

226
00:16:05,048 --> 00:16:06,481
Hey, Ali.

227
00:16:09,586 --> 00:16:11,816
Look, this is cute, but come on.

228
00:16:12,022 --> 00:16:14,820
Push up those boobs.
Got them, show them. Work them.

229
00:16:15,926 --> 00:16:17,917
And don't ever
go behind my back again.

230
00:16:18,895 --> 00:16:22,296
- Yes, ma'am.
- And don't ever call me ma'am again.

231
00:16:22,465 --> 00:16:25,400
- Yes, sir. I mean ma'am. I mean Tess.
- Get on the floor.

232
00:16:28,838 --> 00:16:30,066
"Ma'am"?

233
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,730
What am I, my mother?

234
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:33,068
Yes, ma'am.

235
00:16:33,243 --> 00:16:34,471
Up yours.

236
00:16:35,726 --> 00:16:36,585

241
00:16:56,366 --> 00:16:59,096
Dewar's rocks and a bottle of
your best champagne for the table.

242
00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:01,635
Oh, and will you tell Nikki
that I'm here?

243
00:17:01,805 --> 00:17:02,965
And you are...?

244
00:17:03,139 --> 00:17:04,333
A member since '91.

245
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:07,940
Marcus Gerber. And you are?

246
00:17:08,111 --> 00:17:10,477
- Ali.
- Ali.

247
00:17:11,648 --> 00:17:12,910
I'm here.

248
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:16,112
You're late, you're late
for a very important date.

249
00:17:16,286 --> 00:17:17,583
Georgia went on for you.

250
00:17:23,393 --> 00:17:26,692
What is that waitress doing here?
I want that bitch out now.

251
00:17:26,896 --> 00:17:28,386
What did she ever do to you?

252
00:17:28,565 --> 00:17:30,283
She told me I look like a drag queen.

253
00:17:30,284 --> 00:17:32,001
That can't be the first time
that's happened.

254
00:17:32,535 --> 00:17:34,196
Get my spot.

255
00:17:35,271 --> 00:17:36,898

Ali. Ali.

Ali. Ali. What do you need?

270
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:09,191
Dewar's rocks, bottle of Dom-

271
00:19:09,365 --> 00:19:10,593
And keep it coming.

272
00:19:10,767 --> 00:19:12,792
Yep. So he's a regular, huh?

Marcus Gerber, real estate guy.

274
00:19:15,505 --> 00:19:17,268
Dating Nikki. This week at least.

275
00:19:24,214 --> 00:19:26,239
I wanna be up there. I wanna do that.

276
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:28,043
Question is...

277
00:19:28,218 --> 00:19:29,981
- ... do you have the talent?
- I do.

278
00:19:30,153 --> 00:19:31,450
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

279
00:19:31,621 --> 00:19:32,713
- Positive?
- Yeah.

280
00:19:32,889 --> 00:19:34,584
Good, because you're on.

281
00:20:05,255 --> 00:20:07,689

<i># You know, I went to Long John...</i>

289
00:20:52,035 --> 00:20:53,195
It's simple.

290
00:20:53,369 --> 00:20:55,564
I assume all
your financial obligations...

291
00:20:55,905 --> 00:20:57,202
...buy you out...

292
00:20:57,373 --> 00:20:59,671
...pay you a million
right off the top.

293
00:20:59,842 --> 00:21:00,934
Five hundred each.

294
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:06,505
Where is the partnership that-? You
said there was gonna be a partnership.

295
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:08,212
How about a partnership?

296
00:21:08,885 --> 00:21:11,979
Partnerships don't really
work so well with me.

297
00:21:12,155 --> 00:21:14,919
- And that deal is-
- Very generous.

298
00:21:15,091 --> 00:21:18,083
Good. Because I leave with
my final offer.

299
00:21:18,261 --> 00:21:20,195
You know, not that I give a shit,
but why is it

300
00:21:20,196 --> 00:21:22,129
that you want my club so badly?

301
00:21:22,298 --> 00:21:23,959
I like it.

302
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,220
When I see something I like,
I have to have it.

303
00:21:26,221 --> 00:21:27,497
Been that way since I was a kid.

304
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:30,537
That must have made you
very popular in the sandbox.

305
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:34,202
I did okay.

306
00:21:34,377 --> 00:21:36,277
Do you know what you could
do with that money, Tess?

307
00:21:36,446 --> 00:21:38,710
Do you know what you could
do with that money, Vince?

308
00:21:38,881 --> 00:21:40,439
- Not now.
- Don't "not now" me.

309
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:42,174
The way I see it...

310
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:46,021
...you're in a fix
and I'm in a position to help.

311
00:21:46,189 --> 00:21:49,625
We play this thing right,
and we all come out winners.

312
00:21:49,792 --> 00:21:50,816
Yeah.

313
00:21:50,994 --> 00:21:53,758
Remember, you got that balloon
payment due on the first.

314
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:56,421
Did you also tell him
I have a tattoo on my ass?

315
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:58,960
No. It's business.

316
00:21:59,602 --> 00:22:02,969
I don't think you're gonna get
another opportunity like this.

317
00:22:05,208 --> 00:22:06,539
So take it.

318
00:22:19,222 --> 00:22:21,417
- No.
- She means not now.

319
00:22:21,624 --> 00:22:24,821
No, no.
"Not now" means not now, Vince.

320
00:22:24,994 --> 00:22:26,393
No means no.

321
00:22:27,397 --> 00:22:29,729
Marcus, I don't care what
you're offering.

322
00:22:29,899 --> 00:22:31,764
My club is not for sale.

323
00:22:33,336 --> 00:22:35,133
Well, offer's on the table.

324
00:22:36,239 --> 00:22:37,263
Thanks.

325
00:22:43,212 --> 00:22:44,941
See you in the sandbox.

326
00:22:47,049 --> 00:22:48,978
<i># When he got done drilin' he said,</i>

327
00:22:50,311 --> 00:22:52,713
<i># Ooh baby, that is gonna cost you</i>

328
00:22:54,802 --> 00:22:55,584
<i># Ten</i>

329
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:01,991
<i># But if it ever starts in to throbbing</i>

330
00:23:02,256 --> 00:23:05,152
<i># Come back and see old Long John</i>

331
00:23:05,649 --> 00:23:09,587
<i># Again and again and again and
again and again</i>

332
00:23:09,676 --> 00:23:15,815
<i># Oh, yeah.</i>

333
00:23:20,516 --> 00:23:23,041
Wendy! Do you have my makeup?

334
00:23:23,453 --> 00:23:24,477
Drinks, ladies.

335
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:28,818
All right, white wine.

336
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:30,151
Tom Collins.

337
00:23:30,793 --> 00:23:32,226
Which one of this is Nikki's?

338
00:23:32,395 --> 00:23:34,158
- Both.
- Shit.

339
00:23:36,366 --> 00:23:37,526
That was my shot.

340
00:23:38,568 --> 00:23:40,502
Here's mud in your eye, Nik.

341
00:23:46,642 --> 00:23:50,908
All right. Now I got a buzz,
and you gotta change. You're on.

342
00:23:51,481 --> 00:23:53,210
What are you, my mother?

343
00:23:55,151 --> 00:23:58,143
In case you haven't noticed,
Vince was talking to Marcus Gerber.

344
00:23:58,321 --> 00:24:01,188
Yeah! Well, that's because Marcus
is trying to buy my club.

345
00:24:01,724 --> 00:24:02,952
Mother of God.

346
00:24:03,393 --> 00:24:05,020
Tess? Probably not a good time.

347
00:24:05,194 --> 00:24:06,679
I know you're real busy

348
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,163
and I don't mean to interrupt
you or anything like that.

349
00:24:08,331 --> 00:24:11,391
Hey! Did anybody talk to Dave about
the new vocals?

350
00:24:11,567 --> 00:24:13,626
Ha, that's what just I've been
thinking about... vocals.

351
00:24:14,036 --> 00:24:16,368
- All the girls lip-synch, right?
- Except for Tess.

352
00:24:16,539 --> 00:24:17,767
Of course except for Tess.

353
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:22,036
But wouldn't it be great if we
actually heard the girls sing?

354
00:24:22,211 --> 00:24:23,769
No. It wouldn't be great.

355
00:24:23,946 --> 00:24:24,970
Honey.

356
00:24:25,148 --> 00:24:27,548
People come here
to watch the dancers dance...

357
00:24:27,717 --> 00:24:31,710
...and to watch them lip-synch
to the great singers.

358
00:24:31,888 --> 00:24:33,048
Okay! I hear you. I get it.

359
00:24:33,222 --> 00:24:35,622
I really think, thinking
of ways just to make it better.

360
00:24:35,825 --> 00:24:37,816
And I just don't understand why
we can't just try something different.

361
00:24:37,994 --> 00:24:40,861
You know why you don't understand.
Because it's above your pay grade.

362
00:24:41,664 --> 00:24:42,778
I don't really get what that means.

363
00:24:42,779 --> 00:24:44,106
- Just hear me out one more time.
- No! No...

364
00:24:44,107 --> 00:24:47,747
- This is a really good idea and-
- Ali, Ali, no- No. No. No.

365
00:24:47,837 --> 00:24:49,689
Stop. Take her and remove her.

366
00:24:49,699 --> 00:24:51,231
Okay, let's go. Come on, let's go.

367
00:24:51,407 --> 00:24:54,137
I'm sure they need you back on
the floor, but thanks for visiting us.

368
00:24:55,478 --> 00:24:57,742
All right.
Oh, this is not for anybody.

369
00:24:59,282 --> 00:25:02,581
You look so beautiful right now.
I can't even tell you...

370
00:25:02,752 --> 00:25:05,550
And you are so full of shit.

371
00:25:19,802 --> 00:25:21,235
Goddamn it!

372
00:25:41,057 --> 00:25:42,081
Ali?

373
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:49,757
You can just have a seat.

374
00:25:50,533 --> 00:25:52,865
I'm gonna grab us both
a drink, yeah?

375
00:25:54,203 --> 00:25:56,865
Oh, and here.

376
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:58,529
Call whoever you want.

377
00:25:58,808 --> 00:26:00,605
Long distance, whatever.

378
00:26:02,278 --> 00:26:04,439
- I can't.
- What do you mean?

379
00:26:04,847 --> 00:26:05,939
I don't have anyone.

380
00:26:07,116 --> 00:26:11,780
No parents or siblings,
aunts, uncles, anyone?

381
00:26:11,954 --> 00:26:12,978
No one.

382
00:26:16,626 --> 00:26:18,958
So you're not here to use my phone.

383
00:26:19,996 --> 00:26:22,157
No, no, stop. Stop, please.
It's gonna be all right.

384
00:26:23,199 --> 00:26:24,325
You can crash here.

385
00:26:27,036 --> 00:26:30,233
Just please, please, stop crying.

386
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:32,867
Okay. Okay.

387
00:26:34,944 --> 00:26:36,571
I'll take that.

388
00:26:43,319 --> 00:26:44,343
Better?

389
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,885
Good.

390
00:26:46,689 --> 00:26:47,986
Just one night.

391
00:26:48,157 --> 00:26:51,024
Till it's light out and I can figure
out my next move.

392
00:26:52,161 --> 00:26:53,185
Deal.

393
00:27:03,072 --> 00:27:04,403
That's beautiful.

394
00:27:08,244 --> 00:27:09,336
Who wrote that?

395
00:27:11,113 --> 00:27:12,239
I did.

396
00:27:12,415 --> 00:27:13,677
You wrote that?

397
00:27:13,849 --> 00:27:16,943
Jack, that's... That's really good.

398
00:27:18,688 --> 00:27:20,019
Thank you.

399
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:22,715
- You have more?
- Yeah.

400
00:27:23,893 --> 00:27:26,293
Nothing that's ready to be heard.

401
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:28,727
Hey, Jack...

402
00:27:29,065 --> 00:27:30,657
...why did you leave Kentucky?

403
00:27:32,568 --> 00:27:33,762
Why did you leave Iowa?

404
00:27:37,406 --> 00:27:40,204
Because I looked around
and realized...

405
00:27:41,243 --> 00:27:44,804
...there wasn't one person
whose life I wanted.

406
00:27:44,981 --> 00:27:46,005
Exactly.

407
00:27:48,284 --> 00:27:49,308
Hey, Jack.

408
00:27:51,854 --> 00:27:54,379
I'm really glad I don't have to
be alone tonight.

409
00:27:56,025 --> 00:27:57,083
Get some sleep.

410
00:28:09,438 --> 00:28:10,598
Morning.

411
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,764
- Coffee?
- Black.

412
00:28:14,343 --> 00:28:15,901
Like my soul.

413
00:28:16,078 --> 00:28:18,638
I took the liberty
of making breakfast.

414
00:28:18,814 --> 00:28:21,647
I hope you don't mind.
It's the least I could do.

415
00:28:21,817 --> 00:28:23,045
Smells great.

416
00:28:23,319 --> 00:28:25,219
She's pretty. Your sister?

417
00:28:25,388 --> 00:28:27,322
- Fiancée.
- You're straight?

418
00:28:28,057 --> 00:28:29,922
- You thought I was gay?
- Yeah.

419
00:28:30,092 --> 00:28:31,474
- Wait, why?
- I don't know.

420
00:28:31,475 --> 00:28:32,856
The day bed, the eyeliner.

421
00:28:33,062 --> 00:28:34,689
It's a very straight look.

422
00:28:34,864 --> 00:28:37,298
You know, it works at the club,
Tess loves it-

423
00:28:37,466 --> 00:28:38,728
Okay.

424
00:28:39,101 --> 00:28:40,534
I should put on some pants.

425
00:28:40,703 --> 00:28:41,965
Probably.

426
00:28:42,138 --> 00:28:44,129
So where is she, this fiancée?

427
00:28:44,306 --> 00:28:46,103
She's in New York doing a play.

428
00:28:46,275 --> 00:28:48,903
Now that you're straight
and engaged...

429
00:28:49,078 --> 00:28:51,979
...I feel really weird I came here
in the first place.

430
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:56,078
I'm all right.

431
00:28:56,252 --> 00:28:59,585
- I'll be out of your hair in no time.
- Really, you don't have to leave.

432
00:28:59,755 --> 00:29:02,280
- Don't worry about me.
- I mean, it's pouring outside.

433
00:29:02,591 --> 00:29:06,425
I got a plan.
If you could just get the door for me.

434
00:29:09,298 --> 00:29:10,322
Thank you.

435
00:29:10,499 --> 00:29:12,865
- You're welcome.
- See you at the club.

436
00:29:43,132 --> 00:29:45,293
Ali! What are you doing?

437
00:29:45,501 --> 00:29:46,866
Come back inside!

438
00:29:47,036 --> 00:29:48,697
No, Jack, I'm fine.

439
00:29:48,871 --> 00:29:50,099
It's pouring.

440
00:29:50,272 --> 00:29:52,604
It's just water, for chrissake.

441
00:29:53,142 --> 00:29:54,166
Damn it.

442
00:29:54,577 --> 00:29:56,511
Get your ass back in my house.

443
00:29:56,679 --> 00:29:58,647
You've done enough.
Just leave it alone. I'm fine.

444
00:29:59,081 --> 00:30:02,915
All right, all right, fine.
Here we go.

445
00:30:03,085 --> 00:30:05,053
Put me down.
What are you doing over me?

446
00:30:05,221 --> 00:30:07,712
You have nowhere to go
and I have a couch.

447
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:10,358
Like it or not, you're gonna stayed
here for a few more days.

448
00:30:15,965 --> 00:30:17,592
Hey, Natalie.

449
00:30:19,502 --> 00:30:21,493
Really? That's great.

450
00:30:36,752 --> 00:30:37,776
Georgia?

451
00:30:38,788 --> 00:30:39,914
Yeah.

452
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:46,194
Oh, God, please don't have the flu.

453
00:30:48,831 --> 00:30:50,321
Oh, God.

454
00:30:51,133 --> 00:30:52,566
Please have the flu.

455
00:30:56,205 --> 00:30:58,765
Why do they call it morning
sickness...

456
00:30:58,941 --> 00:31:01,842
...if it hits you at every fricking
moment of the day?

457
00:31:02,011 --> 00:31:03,273
Have you told Damon yet?

458
00:31:03,746 --> 00:31:05,213
No, not yet.

459
00:31:05,781 --> 00:31:09,649
Well, sweetheart, you know,
at some point he's going to notice.

460
00:31:09,819 --> 00:31:10,979
He's a guy.

461
00:31:11,153 --> 00:31:14,611
He's not gonna notice
until my belly's blocking the TV.

462
00:31:15,424 --> 00:31:17,051
Well, what are you gonna do?

463
00:31:17,526 --> 00:31:20,359
I don't know, Tess. I'm really scared.

464
00:31:20,529 --> 00:31:22,759
Oh, honey, don't be scared.

465
00:31:22,932 --> 00:31:26,993
Whatever you decide,
we will take care of you. Okay?

466
00:31:27,169 --> 00:31:28,864
But you've got to tell Damon.

467
00:31:29,038 --> 00:31:31,029
I figured as long as he doesn't know-

468
00:31:31,407 --> 00:31:34,205
...I can still pretend he's gonna be
excited about it.

469
00:31:34,376 --> 00:31:37,903
He's gonna be thrilled.
Are you kidding? He'll be thrilled.

470
00:31:54,063 --> 00:31:56,190
Excellent. That was great.

471
00:31:56,365 --> 00:31:58,492
Thank you very much, ladies.

472
00:32:02,905 --> 00:32:05,396
What happened to
all the great dancers in L.A.?

473
00:32:05,574 --> 00:32:07,371
They're all dancing with the stars.

474
00:32:07,543 --> 00:32:09,773
Call Andre and ask him.
He might have somebody.

475
00:32:09,945 --> 00:32:10,969
Okay.

476
00:32:11,347 --> 00:32:13,247
Don't like her, I don't like her.

477
00:32:13,415 --> 00:32:15,815
I don't love any of them.
She's the best one.

478
00:32:15,985 --> 00:32:17,350
What is that?

479
00:32:23,559 --> 00:32:24,719
What is she doing?

480
00:32:24,894 --> 00:32:26,418
I think she's auditioning.

481
00:32:29,531 --> 00:32:30,828
Hey, Dave, cut it!

482
00:32:34,003 --> 00:32:35,868
Hold on a second, I can do this.

483
00:32:36,038 --> 00:32:38,632
And I think that it's sweet
that you think you can.

484
00:32:38,807 --> 00:32:39,934
Just tell me what you're
looking for. I...

485
00:32:39,944 --> 00:32:42,504
I'm looking for someone who
can do the routine.

486
00:32:43,812 --> 00:32:46,747
Excuse me? I'm talking to you!

487
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:49,474
Oh, shit.

488
00:32:49,952 --> 00:32:51,476
Just tell me what you want.

489
00:32:51,921 --> 00:32:53,252
I can't tell you.

490
00:32:53,422 --> 00:32:55,014
Nobody can tell you.

491
00:32:55,224 --> 00:32:58,091
You gotta make me believe
that you belong up there.

492
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:01,752
That you own that stage and that
nobody's gonna take it from you.

493
00:33:02,298 --> 00:33:03,560
That's the way it works.

494
00:33:03,732 --> 00:33:06,530
You wanna show me something,
show me that.

495
00:33:07,536 --> 00:33:08,560
All right.

496
00:33:08,737 --> 00:33:11,331
Which number do you wanna see?
I know every single one of them.

497
00:33:11,507 --> 00:33:14,067
- You know every single number?
- Which one do you wanna see?

498
00:33:16,078 --> 00:33:18,239
"Wagon Wheel Watusi."

499
00:33:32,561 --> 00:33:33,755
What's going on?

500
00:34:36,425 --> 00:34:38,859
Well, I couldn't keep my eyes off her.

501
00:34:39,528 --> 00:34:40,893
Try harder.

502
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:43,755
You know,
you were off the whole last half.

503
00:34:43,932 --> 00:34:48,301
Come on, Tess. Come on, I'll practice
till I bleed. I know I can do this.

504
00:34:48,470 --> 00:34:50,438
You know, we have better dancers.

505
00:34:50,606 --> 00:34:52,904
Well, then say thank you very much
and goodbye.

506
00:34:53,075 --> 00:34:56,340
If you just give me a chance.
I swear to God I won't disappoint you.

507
00:34:56,512 --> 00:34:58,412
Didn't anybody ever give you
a shot in like, please...

508
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:00,172
Please, I want this so bad.

509
00:35:00,349 --> 00:35:03,750
- If you just give me a chance, I'd-
- All right. God!

510
00:35:03,952 --> 00:35:05,112
You got the job.

511
00:35:08,490 --> 00:35:11,721
What are you so excited about?
She's your replacement.

512
00:35:12,528 --> 00:35:15,019
Thank you, Tess. You won't regret it.

513
00:35:15,964 --> 00:35:17,625
I am so gonna regret this.

514
00:35:22,971 --> 00:35:24,529
What is Ali short for?

515
00:35:24,706 --> 00:35:26,697
- Alice.
- Alice?

516
00:35:27,409 --> 00:35:29,502
Well, welcome to Wonderland.

517
00:35:30,412 --> 00:35:31,879
Meet me upstairs in five.

518
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:40,711
Well, sorry for the short notice...

519
00:35:41,623 --> 00:35:42,681
...but I quit.

520
00:35:43,859 --> 00:35:45,053
It's okay.

521
00:35:45,227 --> 00:35:48,458
And with my new raise,
I will be off your couch in no time.

522
00:35:56,872 --> 00:35:58,066
Here we go.

523
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,969
Black corset, first number.

524
00:36:00,142 --> 00:36:02,940
Second number, "Wagon Wheel,"
that's that.

525
00:36:03,112 --> 00:36:05,580
Swarovski bustier,
that's for the third number.

526
00:36:05,747 --> 00:36:08,648
And this is for "Miss Otis Regrets."

527
00:36:08,817 --> 00:36:11,217
And remember, with that, don't...

528
00:36:12,988 --> 00:36:14,580
...pull the trigger.

529
00:36:16,758 --> 00:36:21,766
<i># Zephyr in the sky at night I wonder</i>

530
00:36:21,856 --> 00:36:28,191
<i># Do my tears of mourning sink
beneath the sun</i>

531
00:36:31,334 --> 00:36:36,017
<i># She's got herself a universe
gone quickly</i>

532
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:44,949
<i># For the call of thunder
threatens everyone</i>

533
00:36:44,966 --> 00:36:48,395
<i># And I feel like I just got home</i>

534
00:36:48,405 --> 00:36:50,402
<i># And I feel</i>

535
00:36:52,444 --> 00:36:56,263
<i># And I feel like I just got home</i>

536
00:36:56,264 --> 00:36:59,900
<i># And I feel</i>

537
00:37:02,271 --> 00:37:05,502
You like her, admit it.  I know it
kills you, but you have to admit it.

538
00:37:05,674 --> 00:37:08,643
No. You know, she pulls focus,
she doesn't blend in.

539
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:10,539
A girl that doesn't blend in?

540
00:37:10,712 --> 00:37:11,974
Oh, my.

541
00:37:12,147 --> 00:37:14,081
That is so beneath you.

542
00:37:15,217 --> 00:37:17,777
Here we go, here we go.
Don't lose those again, okay.

543
00:37:17,953 --> 00:37:19,147
How you doing?

544
00:37:19,321 --> 00:37:22,813
My boobs are pushed up to my ears,
my thong's a mile up my butt...

545
00:37:22,991 --> 00:37:26,483
...and my eyelashes are so thick
they could kick up a stiff wind.

546
00:37:26,929 --> 00:37:29,898
Fun being a girl, isn't it?
Come on, let's go, let's go.

547
00:37:33,402 --> 00:37:35,666
- You guys wanna go grab pizza?
- Yes, please.

548
00:37:36,238 --> 00:37:38,502
- Yeah.
- I'm starving.

549
00:37:38,674 --> 00:37:39,732
Good, let's go.

550
00:37:39,908 --> 00:37:41,375
My day was so long.

551
00:37:43,245 --> 00:37:44,872
Ice cream sounds so good.

552
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,009
That's so bad.

553
00:37:48,417 --> 00:37:51,181
- I'm gonna get so full tonight.
- What?

554
00:38:21,617 --> 00:38:23,084
Where is everybody?

555
00:38:23,252 --> 00:38:25,447
They went out for pizza.

556
00:38:26,121 --> 00:38:27,782
I wasn't hungry.

557
00:38:33,161 --> 00:38:35,152
That brush isn't working cause
it's too old.

558
00:38:35,330 --> 00:38:37,230
Well, it's the only brush I have.

559
00:38:39,034 --> 00:38:40,467
I'll let you use mine.

560
00:38:44,806 --> 00:38:47,001
- Here.
- Thanks.

561
00:38:49,978 --> 00:38:52,469
All right, here. Let me help you.

562
00:38:54,016 --> 00:38:56,280
First of all, you gotta wet it if
you're gonna get a clean line.

563
00:38:57,486 --> 00:38:58,953
Close your eyes.

564
00:38:59,121 --> 00:39:01,988
When you are putting on
your makeup...

565
00:39:02,958 --> 00:39:04,687
...it's like you're an artist.

566
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:07,226
But instead of painting
on a canvas...

567
00:39:07,996 --> 00:39:09,827
...you're painting your face.

568
00:39:12,768 --> 00:39:15,328
My mom was a model
and she was beautiful.

569
00:39:15,504 --> 00:39:16,903
Tall, blond.

570
00:39:17,506 --> 00:39:18,666
Not like me.

571
00:39:20,742 --> 00:39:22,710
Body that could stop a truck.

572
00:39:22,878 --> 00:39:27,713
And she had these girlfriends,
beautiful girls, Colleen and Shirley-

573
00:39:27,883 --> 00:39:30,647
...and they would come over
in the morning...

574
00:39:30,819 --> 00:39:32,770
...and they would all put
their makeup on together

575
00:39:32,771 --> 00:39:34,721
before they went on jobs. Up.

576
00:39:34,890 --> 00:39:38,409
We had a big window in the back
of our house with a ledge on it,

577
00:39:38,419 --> 00:39:41,228
...and they would put their
mirrors side by side by side,

578
00:39:41,229 --> 00:39:42,861
and put out their makeup.

579
00:39:43,031 --> 00:39:46,865
They had lipsticks and blushes,
and it was fabulous.

580
00:39:47,035 --> 00:39:49,419
And I kept thinking, "My God,
I cannot wait till I get old

581
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:51,802
enough to play with this junk."

582
00:39:56,144 --> 00:39:59,136
Didn't you ever watch your mom
put on her makeup?

583
00:40:03,418 --> 00:40:05,181
My mom died when I was 7...

584
00:40:06,154 --> 00:40:07,951
...and it's my first lesson.

585
00:40:16,565 --> 00:40:18,931
You know,
you won't be the new girl forever.

586
00:40:40,122 --> 00:40:41,453
Beautiful.

587
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:50,395
Shit.

588
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:52,862
Ali.

589
00:40:53,235 --> 00:40:55,635
Ali. Did you use my towel again?

590
00:40:55,804 --> 00:40:57,772
I found it soaking wet and
on the floor.

591
00:40:57,973 --> 00:41:00,533
- I don't know. Maybe.
- How's that apartment hunt coming?

592
00:41:02,544 --> 00:41:05,707
I've been looking.
Everything's over 1000 bucks a month.

593
00:41:05,881 --> 00:41:08,873
How can you put a price
on privacy like that? Freedom?

594
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:10,950
Your own bathroom?
Your own clean towels?

595
00:41:10,951 --> 00:41:12,177
Hey Jack! I get it.

596
00:41:16,425 --> 00:41:17,756
It's Natalie.

597
00:41:19,528 --> 00:41:20,552
Hey, babe.

598
00:41:24,466 --> 00:41:28,368
Oh, hey. What about Beachwood Canyon?

599
00:41:28,937 --> 00:41:30,097
Great.

600
00:41:31,907 --> 00:41:33,568
If you have a car.

601
00:41:35,076 --> 00:41:36,941
I mean, truth is...

602
00:41:37,112 --> 00:41:39,603
...you really should get a car first.

603
00:41:39,981 --> 00:41:43,712
I mean, this is L.A. after all.
You know?

604
00:41:45,921 --> 00:41:47,183
I'll tell you what.

605
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:49,623
I'm gonna suck it up...

606
00:41:49,791 --> 00:41:51,918
I'm gonna let you stay
a little bit longer.

607
00:41:52,327 --> 00:41:54,386
Just throw in a little something
for rent, we're good.

608
00:41:54,563 --> 00:41:56,230
A second ago you
wanted me out of here.

609
00:41:56,231 --> 00:41:57,896
I really don't like
my towel being wet.

610
00:41:58,066 --> 00:42:00,694
I don't like the lack of privacy...

611
00:42:01,236 --> 00:42:02,430
...but you're in a jam.

612
00:42:02,604 --> 00:42:03,969
And I'm the kind of guy...

613
00:42:04,139 --> 00:42:07,040
...when a friend is in trouble,
I help.

614
00:42:07,209 --> 00:42:08,369
It's just who I am.

615
00:42:08,910 --> 00:42:10,775
What did Natalie have to say?

616
00:42:10,946 --> 00:42:14,746
Nothing. No, she...
Wow! What did she say?

617
00:42:15,116 --> 00:42:16,378
"Hi." I think that was it.

618
00:42:16,551 --> 00:42:19,019
- And?
- And...

619
00:42:19,187 --> 00:42:21,121
Her play got extended
three more months.

620
00:42:21,289 --> 00:42:23,553
So she has to pay
everything there in rent...

621
00:42:23,725 --> 00:42:25,693
...so I have to cover everything here.

622
00:42:25,861 --> 00:42:28,659
So if you wanna stick around
and chip in, it would-

623
00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:30,263
- Save your ass?
- Help.

624
00:42:32,534 --> 00:42:34,399
Well, will you look at that?

625
00:42:34,936 --> 00:42:37,063
The shoe on the other foot.

626
00:42:37,239 --> 00:42:39,070
One minute I'm a freeloader...

627
00:42:39,241 --> 00:42:40,833
...and the next...

628
00:42:41,009 --> 00:42:44,604
...I'm the only thing standing
between you and eviction.

629
00:42:44,779 --> 00:42:46,474
Just yes or no?

630
00:42:47,315 --> 00:42:49,579
What's the proposal exactly?

631
00:42:50,485 --> 00:42:53,420
Wonderful apartment.
Bathroom included.

632
00:42:53,588 --> 00:42:54,612
I'm listening.

633
00:42:54,789 --> 00:42:56,484
- Full use of the kitchen.
- Keep going.

634
00:42:56,658 --> 00:42:58,251
Six hundred a month,
utilities included.

635
00:42:58,252 --> 00:42:58,626
Closet?

636
00:42:58,636 --> 00:43:00,283
- Half.
- Oh, look.

637
00:43:01,296 --> 00:43:04,993
"Fabulous apartment
with a great view."

638
00:43:05,166 --> 00:43:06,565
Fine, fine.

639
00:43:07,068 --> 00:43:08,092
The whole closet.

640
00:43:08,270 --> 00:43:09,999
- I want the bedroom.
- No way.

641
00:43:10,171 --> 00:43:12,162
Oh, look. "Hot tub, Beverly Hills."

642
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:14,399
All right. You can have my bedroom.

643
00:43:14,743 --> 00:43:15,903
Are you in?

644
00:43:16,177 --> 00:43:17,235
Oh, Jack.

645
00:43:17,412 --> 00:43:20,006
See, I'm the kind of girl...

646
00:43:20,181 --> 00:43:23,048
...if a friend's in trouble, I help.

647
00:43:23,218 --> 00:43:25,516
That's just who I am.

648
00:43:27,989 --> 00:43:29,923
Oh, boy.

649
00:43:37,933 --> 00:43:40,128
Your dream is killing me!

650
00:43:40,302 --> 00:43:41,997
It's killing me!

651
00:43:54,649 --> 00:43:56,310
What was that?

652
00:44:04,292 --> 00:44:05,418
And what's this?

653
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:08,424
It's something about the
two mortgages.

654
00:44:10,098 --> 00:44:13,363
To be perfectly honest,
I haven't got a goddamn clue.

655
00:44:13,935 --> 00:44:16,165
But if I can't raise
the amount of money...

656
00:44:16,338 --> 00:44:19,466
...on that piece of paper by the end
of this month, I lose the club.

657
00:44:21,343 --> 00:44:22,776
It's just money.

658
00:44:22,944 --> 00:44:24,138
It's just a number.

659
00:44:24,846 --> 00:44:26,245
I know...

660
00:44:27,148 --> 00:44:28,979
...but do you think I could do it?

661
00:44:31,653 --> 00:44:33,245
Okay, tell me a lie.

662
00:44:33,955 --> 00:44:36,446
I need your expert sewing skills.

663
00:44:37,659 --> 00:44:39,092
Tell me a new lie.

664
00:44:41,096 --> 00:44:42,791
I don't love you.

665
00:44:51,606 --> 00:44:54,131
Come here. Come here.

666
00:44:58,013 --> 00:44:59,344
It's okay.

667
00:45:11,993 --> 00:45:13,290
Stage fright.

668
00:45:18,099 --> 00:45:20,329
Wait a minute. Hey, hey. hey.
What's in that?

669
00:45:20,502 --> 00:45:21,526
Iced tea.

670
00:45:22,537 --> 00:45:24,402
Iced tea, my ass. Go home.

671
00:45:24,606 --> 00:45:26,574
Yeah, right. I'm about to go on.

672
00:45:26,741 --> 00:45:28,504
No! You're not gonna go on.
You're gonna go home.

673
00:45:28,677 --> 00:45:31,510
Relax. It is one drink.
What is the big deal?

674
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:34,080
Ali, you're gonna take Nikki's spot.

675
00:45:34,249 --> 00:45:36,740
- She can't dance my part.
- Oh yeah! She can and she will.

676
00:45:36,918 --> 00:45:39,033
No, no, no. Oh my God,
I can't do that.

677
00:45:39,034 --> 00:45:39,819
- No, no, no, wait.
- It is Nikki's number.

678
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:41,956
You said you can do any number, right?

679
00:45:42,123 --> 00:45:43,289
Now, I just don't
wanna step on anybody toes.

680
00:45:43,290 --> 00:45:44,455
Then don't.

681
00:45:44,626 --> 00:45:46,025
I don't ca- Listen to me.

682
00:45:47,429 --> 00:45:49,920
You're gonna go on,
and you're gonna go home.

683
00:45:51,533 --> 00:45:52,693
Here, put this on.

684
00:45:56,838 --> 00:45:58,203
Dave.

685
00:45:58,373 --> 00:46:00,568
Tess wants to see you.
Says it's urgent.

686
00:46:00,742 --> 00:46:02,232
I can't leave right now.
I'm working, girl.

687
00:46:02,410 --> 00:46:04,207
Don't say I didn't warn you.

688
00:46:04,379 --> 00:46:05,607
Shit.

689
00:46:05,847 --> 00:46:08,407
Dave this! Dave that! Everybody wants
Dave to do something.

690
00:46:08,583 --> 00:46:11,950
Y'all gonna have me singing
by the time I'm done here, Jesus.

691
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:21,095
<i># Ooh, ow... Well, I got the love
that moved the soul</i>

692
00:46:21,469 --> 00:46:23,467
<i># That show I knows how
to rock and roll</i>

693
00:46:24,010 --> 00:46:25,712
<i># I need a tough lover (yeah yeah)</i>

694
00:46:26,155 --> 00:46:27,567
<i># A tough lover (woo)</i>

695
00:46:27,619 --> 00:46:30,042
<i># He's a tough lover (yeah, yeah)</i>

696
00:46:30,322 --> 00:46:32,071
<i># A tough lover (oh oh)</i>

697
00:46:32,256 --> 00:46:33,980
<i># When he kisses me, I get a thrill</i>

698
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:35,210
<i># When he does that wiggle...</i>

699
00:46:46,221 --> 00:46:47,279
Tess, what's up?

700
00:46:47,455 --> 00:46:48,979
What the hell are you doing
back here?

701
00:46:49,190 --> 00:46:50,378
Nikki said you were looking for me.

702
00:46:50,379 --> 00:46:51,134
Nikki said?

703
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:52,294
- What is going on, Dave?
- Nikki just told me that...

704
00:46:52,594 --> 00:46:54,061
Lower the curtain. Come on, let's go.

705
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:00,765
Bye. Thanks for coming.

706
00:47:11,946 --> 00:47:12,970
Hold it.

707
00:47:15,337 --> 00:47:24,406
<i># Ooh, oh yeah yeah</i>

708
00:47:29,230 --> 00:47:30,595
Raise the curtain.

709
00:47:34,951 --> 00:47:40,565
<i># I need a tough lover, yeah yeah</i>

710
00:47:40,566 --> 00:47:46,529
<i># I need a, a tough lover, woo</i>

711
00:47:46,539 --> 00:47:52,178

712
00:47:52,188 --> 00:47:57,072

714
00:48:02,156 --> 00:48:04,601

715
00:48:04,602 --> 00:48:07,964
<i># I wanna a tough lover (yeah, yeah)</i>

716
00:48:07,965 --> 00:48:10,440
<i># A tough lover (woo)</i>

717
00:48:10,441 --> 00:48:13,681
<i># I need a tough lover (yeah, yeah)</i>

718
00:48:13,691 --> 00:48:16,340
<i># Tough lover (hum, hum)</i>

719
00:48:16,352 --> 00:48:18,627
<i># The seven sisters got nothing on him</i>

720
00:48:19,141 --> 00:48:21,573
<i># I'm talking about a lover
who's fast as the wind</i>

721
00:48:21,954 --> 00:48:24,329
<i># Everyone will talk about
how he got me fixed</i>

722
00:48:24,748 --> 00:48:27,334
<i># It ain't voodoo,
it's just that twist</i>

723
00:48:27,552 --> 00:48:30,159
<i># He will be the greatest lover
that ever come to pass</i>

724
00:48:30,341 --> 00:48:32,825
<i># Don Juan ain't got the
half the chance</i>

725
00:48:32,835 --> 00:48:35,628
<i># I need a tough lover, yeah yeah</i>

726
00:48:36,131 --> 00:48:38,454
<i># A tough lover (woo)</i>

727
00:48:38,464 --> 00:48:41,533

728
00:48:41,543 --> 00:48:44,479

729
00:48:44,628 --> 00:48:47,105

730
00:48:47,305 --> 00:48:49,190

731

732
00:48:52,043 --> 00:48:54,403

he wants to do</i>

733
00:48:54,505 --> 00:48:57,636
<i># Step on Jesse James's
blue suede shoes, yeah</i>

734
00:48:58,225 --> 00:49:02,105

735
00:49:02,552 --> 00:49:04,837

<i># A tough lover (oh oh)</i>

739
00:49:42,630 --> 00:49:44,063
Oh, my God.

740
00:49:47,135 --> 00:49:49,968
Am I the only one that has no idea
what just happened?

741
00:49:50,138 --> 00:49:51,400
You know what, whatever it was-

742
00:49:51,572 --> 00:49:53,836
Oh Tess, the music stopped,
I didn't know what else to do.

743
00:49:54,008 --> 00:49:55,970
I... I had to sing, I'm sorry.
I know, I hope...

744
00:49:56,181 --> 00:49:57,802
You never told me
you could sing like that.

745
00:49:57,979 --> 00:49:59,207
I tried to tell you.

746
00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:00,677
Okay, okay, all right.

747
00:50:00,848 --> 00:50:03,715
This is what we're gonna do.
You guys know the songs, right?

748
00:50:03,885 --> 00:50:04,909
- Oh, yeah.
- Okay...

749
00:50:05,086 --> 00:50:06,702
So tomorrow we're gonna
rehearse all day long,

750
00:50:06,703 --> 00:50:08,317
then tomorrow night you're
gonna sing.

751
00:50:08,656 --> 00:50:10,389
We're gonna go straight
through the show live.

752
00:50:10,390 --> 00:50:11,147
Live!?

753
00:50:11,326 --> 00:50:12,987
- So any questions?
- No.

754
00:50:13,161 --> 00:50:15,466
Okay, good. Okay, great.
Alright, you go with the guys.

755
00:50:15,468 --> 00:50:17,799
Find out what keys you're comfortable
singing the songs you're gonna...

756
00:50:17,809 --> 00:50:22,668
...and I'm going to go up to my office
and plan an entirely new show.

757
00:50:25,006 --> 00:50:26,871
- Okay?
- Oh, my God.

758
00:50:27,608 --> 00:50:28,700
Thanks, Tess.

759
00:50:28,910 --> 00:50:31,071
I'm gonna build a show around her.

760
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:34,271
"They don't come to hear us sing"?

761
00:50:35,183 --> 00:50:37,447
They'll come to hear her sing.

762
00:50:43,558 --> 00:50:46,049
So... how do you feel?

763
00:50:47,362 --> 00:50:48,858
- Amazing.
- Honey,

764
00:50:48,859 --> 00:50:50,354
I've never seen anything like that.

765
00:50:50,965 --> 00:50:54,093
Thanks. Are you sure Tess
really liked it? She wasn't...?

766
00:50:54,969 --> 00:50:56,664
I was bringing down the curtain.

767
00:50:56,838 --> 00:50:59,306
She stopped me.
She's the one who let you sing.

768
00:50:59,774 --> 00:51:00,417
Really?

769
00:51:00,428 --> 00:51:02,340
She wants to build the
whole show around you.

770
00:51:04,112 --> 00:51:06,012
You're crying with happiness, right?

771
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:07,204
Good. Okay.

772
00:51:07,382 --> 00:51:08,906
Brava.

773
00:51:14,455 --> 00:51:17,856
Clearly one of us
has underestimated the other.

774
00:51:26,634 --> 00:51:29,535
I can't believe Tess has you
buried in the kick line.

775
00:51:29,704 --> 00:51:30,898
She didn't know I sang.

776
00:51:31,072 --> 00:51:32,869
Well, you certainly can.

777
00:51:33,241 --> 00:51:35,732
And you are way too good
to be doing it here.

778
00:51:36,210 --> 00:51:37,438
How about a drink?

779
00:51:37,612 --> 00:51:39,170
The bar's right over there.

780
00:51:39,347 --> 00:51:40,507
Tell Jack I sent you.

781
00:51:46,954 --> 00:51:48,751
Where in the hell did that
come from tonight?

782
00:51:49,257 --> 00:51:51,748
- Who knew that you could do that?
- Thanks, Jack.

783
00:51:51,926 --> 00:51:54,326
Who knew any white chick
could sing like that?

784
00:51:54,495 --> 00:51:55,928
How do you do that?

785
00:51:56,097 --> 00:51:59,464
I don't know. It just happens.
I just do it.

786
00:51:59,634 --> 00:52:02,797
I know how that feels.
I gotta pee again, so...

787
00:52:03,704 --> 00:52:04,728
Stop.

788
00:52:05,206 --> 00:52:06,935
We're gonna go get something to eat.

789
00:52:07,408 --> 00:52:08,432
You wanna come?

790
00:52:13,114 --> 00:52:14,274
Yeah, I would.

791
00:52:15,516 --> 00:52:16,778
Let's go.

792
00:52:17,351 --> 00:52:18,909
Look at you.

793
00:52:20,221 --> 00:52:21,381
What? What?

794
00:52:21,556 --> 00:52:24,616
Well, no, just the way
you're gazing after her.

795
00:52:24,792 --> 00:52:26,692
I have a fiancée, remember?

796
00:52:26,894 --> 00:52:29,692
Yes. No, I do. I know.
Three thousand miles away.

797
00:52:29,864 --> 00:52:30,888
We still talk every day.

798
00:52:31,065 --> 00:52:32,657
You do? About what?

799
00:52:32,834 --> 00:52:34,426
Let me guess, don't tell me.

800
00:52:34,602 --> 00:52:36,365
About her.

801
00:52:38,072 --> 00:52:39,096
Her.

802
00:52:39,474 --> 00:52:41,237
And, I don't know...

803
00:52:41,609 --> 00:52:42,803
Her.

804
00:52:42,977 --> 00:52:45,468
All I'm saying is that,
that one there...

805
00:52:45,646 --> 00:52:48,308
...is beautiful
on the inside as well...

806
00:52:48,483 --> 00:52:50,917
...and she's not going to be
available forever.

807
00:52:51,252 --> 00:52:54,221
Relationship advice from
Mr. One-Night-Stand himself.

808
00:52:54,388 --> 00:52:55,412
That is...

809
00:52:55,590 --> 00:52:56,614
Forgot my purse.

810
00:53:00,628 --> 00:53:01,959
- What?
- Oh, no.

811
00:53:02,130 --> 00:53:05,759
I was just telling Jack here how
every opportunity has a shelf life.

812
00:53:08,369 --> 00:53:09,393
Come here.

813
00:53:10,771 --> 00:53:11,999
Look there.

814
00:53:12,974 --> 00:53:15,534
Awfully pretty, but too much.

815
00:53:15,710 --> 00:53:18,804
See, I like that.

816
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:22,180
No, I'm not cutting my hair.

817
00:53:22,350 --> 00:53:26,150
Who said anything about you
cutting your hair? You can wear a wig.

818
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:28,185
I'm wearing one right now.

00:56:03,144 --> 00:56:04,975
Hey there, big boy.

845
00:56:06,881 --> 00:56:09,349
So, what do you think?

846
00:56:09,884 --> 00:56:11,317
I think you look...

847
00:56:11,485 --> 00:56:13,180
I mean, it looks...

848
00:56:13,888 --> 00:56:16,686
Jack, we're friends, for chrissake.

849
00:56:17,325 --> 00:56:19,987
It's not like we're brother
and sister.

850
00:56:23,331 --> 00:56:25,891
No, we certainly are not.

851
00:56:26,067 --> 00:56:28,627
I don't get why everyone's
having a conniption over her.

852
00:56:28,803 --> 00:56:31,829
She's just a tacky farm girl
from Iowa.

853
00:56:33,507 --> 00:56:35,372
And we know a cow when we see one.

854
00:56:38,579 --> 00:56:41,173
Don't underestimate us farm girls.

855
00:56:43,851 --> 00:56:45,113
Vince.

856
00:56:45,286 --> 00:56:46,719
This round's on me.

857
00:56:50,658 --> 00:56:52,216
I don't normally do this...

858
00:56:52,393 --> 00:56:55,226
...but, Vince, I'm doubling my offer.

859
00:56:55,963 --> 00:56:57,931
It's either you or the auction house.

860
00:56:58,099 --> 00:56:59,930
No, I am not selling.

861
00:57:00,101 --> 00:57:02,433
Do you know what happens
when you default on a loan?

862
00:57:02,603 --> 00:57:03,661
No, hum a few bars.

863
00:57:03,838 --> 00:57:06,705
I'm not screwing around here.
Where's the money gonna comes from?

864
00:57:06,874 --> 00:57:09,604
Ali's a hit.
We could charge 50 bucks a head now.

865
00:57:09,777 --> 00:57:11,106
- Raising the admission?
- What...

866
00:57:11,107 --> 00:57:12,034
That's not good enough.

867
00:57:12,346 --> 00:57:15,213
You have been saying
that the sky is falling forever.

868
00:57:15,383 --> 00:57:17,283
And everything always works out fine.

869
00:57:17,451 --> 00:57:19,612
Tell that to the people
losing everything.

870
00:57:19,787 --> 00:57:21,550
I don't wanna be one of them.

871
00:57:21,722 --> 00:57:23,747
- I love this place too.
- No, you don't.

872
00:57:23,924 --> 00:57:25,118
- I do.
- No, you don't!

873
00:57:25,292 --> 00:57:27,192
- Yes, I do!
- Oh, no, you don't.

874
00:57:27,628 --> 00:57:31,029
Look, you have many
fine qualities, Vincent.

875
00:57:31,198 --> 00:57:33,257
And then you've got
some iffy qualities.

876
00:57:33,434 --> 00:57:35,061
But you've never been a phony.

877
00:57:35,236 --> 00:57:37,830
Just tell Marcus no.

878
00:57:53,654 --> 00:57:54,814
Jack?

879
00:57:57,525 --> 00:57:59,049
Yep. Just got in.

880
00:57:59,794 --> 00:58:01,694
I'm in here.
Can you come zip me up?

881
00:58:05,199 --> 00:58:06,689
Hey, where you been?

882
00:58:07,435 --> 00:58:08,561
Writing music.

883
00:58:08,903 --> 00:58:10,461
Can I hear?

884
00:58:11,972 --> 00:58:14,270
- It's not ready.
- It's not ready.

885
00:58:14,942 --> 00:58:15,966
Who's that?

886
00:58:16,677 --> 00:58:18,372
Me and my mom on my 7th birthday.

887
00:58:18,779 --> 00:58:20,713
She died a few weeks later.

888
00:58:21,182 --> 00:58:22,581
You must miss her.

889
00:58:23,617 --> 00:58:27,883
Every single day something happens
that I wish I could tell her about.

890
00:58:29,223 --> 00:58:31,157
And what happened today?

891
00:58:35,963 --> 00:58:37,089
Nothing yet.

892
00:58:44,238 --> 00:58:46,866
You should get that.
It's probably Natalie.

893
00:58:47,041 --> 00:58:48,269
Probably.

894
00:58:52,213 --> 00:58:53,347
Hey, babe.

895
00:58:53,948 --> 00:58:55,142

I have to do inventory tonight.

Want me to call you a cab?

No, that's okay.
I'll get a ride with Coco.

- For what?
- I'll drop you off.

925
01:01:38,946 --> 01:01:40,379
Coco left five minutes ago.

926
01:01:41,649 --> 01:01:44,777
I was coming over to talk to you.
I caught the end of your conversation.

01:01:46,453 --> 01:01:49,217
- Talk to me about...?
- Dinner. With me. Give me that.

...you'll follow me.

930
01:01:56,997 --> 01:01:59,898
Hold on a second.
Where you going? Hey!

931
01:02:04,338 --> 01:02:07,774
Where are you taking me?
This is not the way to my place.

932
01:02:07,941 --> 01:02:09,169
I told you. Dinner.

Dinner?

934
01:02:10,611 --> 01:02:13,910
I'm not going to dinner with you.
You're seeing Nikki.

935

We're just friends.

Aren't you glad you left?

938
01:02:22,423 --> 01:02:24,948
- Oh, damn it.
- What?

939
01:02:25,926 --> 01:02:28,451
I just remember I gotta make
a quick appearance at a party.

940
01:02:28,629 --> 01:02:30,062
You just remembered.

941
01:02:30,230 --> 01:02:33,631
It's on the way. We'll be quick.
Ten minutes, tops. Do you mind?

942
01:02:33,801 --> 01:02:34,995
And if I do?

943
01:02:35,169 --> 01:02:36,602
Then you've been kidnapped.

944
01:02:45,979 --> 01:02:47,446
Hey, Marcus.

945
01:02:49,750 --> 01:02:51,081
Nice house.

946
01:02:56,857 --> 01:02:59,587
What are you doing?
You can't just take that.

947
01:03:01,695 --> 01:03:04,323
Put that back. You're gonna
get us kicked out of here.

948
01:03:04,498 --> 01:03:05,726
Not if we sneak out first, come on.

949
01:03:08,868 --> 01:03:11,029
Hey, hey. Greg, Marla, this is Ali.

950
01:03:11,204 --> 01:03:12,933
- Hi.
- Hey.

951
01:03:13,106 --> 01:03:14,733
My God, those are amazing shoes.

952
01:03:15,074 --> 01:03:16,541
Aren't they? Louboutin.

953
01:03:16,709 --> 01:03:17,733
Great party.

954
01:03:17,910 --> 01:03:19,605
Always good to have you, man.

955
01:03:20,513 --> 01:03:23,812
Wait a minute. You had to make
an appearance at your own party?

956
01:03:23,983 --> 01:03:25,848
Would've been rude not to, right?

957
01:03:26,085 --> 01:03:27,109
You'd like those guys.

958
01:03:27,119 --> 01:03:29,885
Greg's an entertainment editor with
'The Times', Marla's a designer.

959
01:03:30,056 --> 01:03:32,581
I'm gonna dream about those shoes.

960
01:03:34,927 --> 01:03:37,157
L.A. looks gorgeous from up here.

961
01:03:37,930 --> 01:03:40,558
That view cost me three times
what the house did.

962
01:03:40,733 --> 01:03:42,360
See that strip mall down there?

963
01:03:42,835 --> 01:03:43,859
You own that too?

964
01:03:44,137 --> 01:03:46,105
No. I own everything above it.

965
01:03:47,140 --> 01:03:49,608
- There is nothing above it.
- Exactly.

966
01:03:49,809 --> 01:03:51,868
- So you own air.
- Air rights.

967
01:03:52,044 --> 01:03:54,505
The guy that owns the strip mall
ran into some money issues,

968
01:03:54,506 --> 01:03:55,626
almost had to sell.

969
01:03:55,648 --> 01:03:58,208
Whoever he sold it to
would've put up a huge tower.

970
01:03:58,384 --> 01:04:00,875
So I bought the air rights.

971
01:04:01,387 --> 01:04:03,184
Now, no one can ever build
above one story.

972
01:04:03,194 --> 01:04:04,550
Well, aren't you clever.

973
01:04:04,957 --> 01:04:06,639
Mall guy gets to keep his property,

974
01:04:07,581 --> 01:04:09,394
I get to keep the second
best view in L.A.

975
01:04:09,562 --> 01:04:10,586
What's the first?

976
01:04:13,766 --> 01:04:15,766
How many girls have you
used that line on?

977
01:04:15,981 --> 01:04:17,298
None ever who called me on it.

978
01:04:19,906 --> 01:04:21,134
What do you want, Ali?

979
01:04:22,408 --> 01:04:23,739
In life.

980
01:04:24,911 --> 01:04:26,310
And why should I tell you?

981
01:04:26,712 --> 01:04:29,112
Because you're talented enough
to get whatever you want...

982
01:04:29,282 --> 01:04:31,978
...and I'm smart enough to
help make it happen.

983
01:04:45,331 --> 01:04:48,767
- Somebody got a package.
- Ali.

984
01:04:49,335 --> 01:04:50,962
- Ali.
- Who's it from?

985
01:04:53,840 --> 01:04:55,865
- Come on, open it.
- Let's see. Come on.

986
01:05:01,314 --> 01:05:03,077
Oh, my God.

987
01:05:03,449 --> 01:05:04,973
Those are so cute.

988
01:05:06,719 --> 01:05:09,779
- They're so pretty.
- Those are so pretty.

989
01:05:10,556 --> 01:05:11,580
Who's the sucker?

990
01:05:11,757 --> 01:05:13,782
Let's go. Girls, please, break it up.
Come... come on-

991
01:05:13,960 --> 01:05:15,484
Hey Coco, let's go.
Let's go! Five minutes.

992
01:05:15,661 --> 01:05:16,958
Ali Cat, you're up next.

993
01:05:17,129 --> 01:05:19,063
My nana used to call me Ali Cat.

994
01:05:19,232 --> 01:05:21,063
Did she really? That's so fascinating.

995
01:05:21,234 --> 01:05:23,634
- Why don't I have a nickname?
- Oh, you do.

996
01:05:23,803 --> 01:05:26,101
- Well, he never uses it.
- No, I do.

997
01:05:26,272 --> 01:05:27,296
When?

998
01:05:27,473 --> 01:05:28,963
When you leave the room.

999
01:05:29,308 --> 01:05:31,037
- Slut.
- I heard that.

1000
01:05:31,210 --> 01:05:33,906
So sorry! I had no idea! Oh, my God.

1001
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:37,049
Girls, come on! We have a show to do!
Let's go, let's go! Let's go-

1002
01:05:37,216 --> 01:05:39,184
- Okay!
- Hurry up! Come on!

You were out very late last night.

Oh, I got a ride home with that guy...

1019
01:07:14,914 --> 01:07:16,108
...Marcus.

1020
01:07:16,582 --> 01:07:17,708
Went to a party.

01:07:18,918 --> 01:07:20,010
Marcus?

1022
01:07:22,955 --> 01:07:24,081
New shoes?

1023
01:07:25,291 --> 01:07:26,349
Yeah.

1024
01:07:28,427 --> 01:07:29,451

You're getting a lot more
than a little.

Not from anyone that matters.

1039
01:08:16,675 --> 01:08:18,836
I just think you should be careful.

1040
01:08:19,011 --> 01:08:21,726
And I think that if you really
feel the need to tell a girl

01:08:21,736 --> 01:08:23,070
what she should and shouldn't do...

Monsieur Louboutin is at Table 18

01:11:13,152 --> 01:11:15,643
I just made a call to Greg
at the Times.

1079
01:11:15,821 --> 01:11:19,587

Ali Rose, Harold Saint.

Harold-? Shut up.
You worked with Etta James.

1081
01:11:23,796 --> 01:11:26,196
Her. Chewed me up
and spat me out, that one.

01:11:28,534 --> 01:11:29,558
Hello.

1083
01:11:31,704 --> 01:11:33,865
You've got a set of pipes on you too,
young lady.

1084
01:11:34,573 --> 01:11:35,699
Thanks.

1085
01:11:36,709 --> 01:11:38,904
We have to do something about that.

1086
01:11:39,078 --> 01:11:41,911
You snooze, you lose, pretty boy.

1087
01:12:00,199 --> 01:12:01,496
Standing room only.

1088
01:12:02,001 --> 01:12:03,468
I know, doesn't it look great?

1089
01:12:04,637 --> 01:12:07,037
But I just got another notice
from the bank.

1090
01:12:07,206 --> 01:12:08,956
We would have to fill Dodger Stadium

1091
01:12:08,957 --> 01:12:11,481
for a month to come up with
the cash we need.

1092
01:12:12,711 --> 01:12:15,145
I just gotta figure out a way
to buy us more time.

1093
01:12:22,121 --> 01:12:24,055
- Hey.
- Hey.

1094
01:12:24,223 --> 01:12:25,952
That really is a great shot.

1095
01:12:27,526 --> 01:12:30,495
It's so weird seeing myself
in the paper like that.

1096
01:12:31,597 --> 01:12:33,622
Well, you might have to
get used to it.

1097
01:12:35,601 --> 01:12:37,068
I don't think I ever could.

1098

You know, I don't wanna come off

...but maybe you could learn
from my mistakes.

1100
01:12:45,577 --> 01:12:47,169
What do you mean?

1101
01:12:47,346 --> 01:12:50,144
You gotta learn who are the people
that you can trust...

1102
01:12:50,316 --> 01:12:52,307
who are the people who really
like you for you...

1103
01:12:52,484 --> 01:12:55,282
...and who are the people who
just want something from you.

1104
01:12:55,921 --> 01:12:58,253
- You don't like Marcus, do you?
- No, I don't.

1105
01:12:58,691 --> 01:13:01,182
I don't like him. I don't trust him.

1106
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:03,954
I don't think you should trust him.

1107
01:13:04,830 --> 01:13:09,267
But is that really what's best for me
or what's best for you?

1108
01:13:09,435 --> 01:13:10,697
I don't know.

1109
01:13:10,869 --> 01:13:13,429
I hope it's best for both of us.

1110
01:13:15,708 --> 01:13:16,970
All right.

1111
01:13:18,877 --> 01:13:19,969
See you tomorrow.

1112
01:13:27,453 --> 01:13:29,114
There you are.

1113
01:13:29,588 --> 01:13:32,887
These babies desperately need
your glue gun, okay?

1114
01:13:33,058 --> 01:13:34,491
- Especially this one.
- Okay.

1115
01:13:34,660 --> 01:13:35,854
- Okay?
- Yep.

1116
01:13:37,329 --> 01:13:39,024
She's not going anywhere.

1117
01:13:40,165 --> 01:13:41,723
- Good night.
- Night.

1118
01:13:49,475 --> 01:13:51,102
Oh, hey, Tess.

1119
01:13:51,276 --> 01:13:54,211
I got that track you wanted to
rehearse for tomorrow night show.

1120
01:13:55,147 --> 01:13:56,239
Jesus.

1121
01:13:56,415 --> 01:13:59,222
Honey, I'm sorry. I've got a
million things on my mind

1122
01:13:59,224 --> 01:14:00,909
and I completely forgot.

1123
01:14:01,120 --> 01:14:02,553
It's all good.

1124
01:14:03,155 --> 01:14:06,128
If it's too late now, I guess I can
come in early tomorrow morning?

1125
01:14:06,158 --> 01:14:10,026
No, no. Let's just... let's just
get it out of the way.

1126
01:14:16,535 --> 01:14:17,866
You want a spot?

1127
01:14:18,404 --> 01:14:19,769
Yeah.

1128
01:14:32,885 --> 01:14:36,514
<i># Feelin' broken</i>

1129
01:14:36,889 --> 01:14:40,848
<i># Barely holdin' on</i>

1130
01:14:41,460 --> 01:14:44,952
<i># But there's still something

1131
01:14:45,564 --> 01:14:47,794

1132
01:14:48,200 --> 01:14:49,758

01:14:49,935 --> 01:14:51,960

1134
01:14:52,171 --> 01:14:56,164

1135
01:14:57,576 --> 01:15:00,443

1136

1149
01:15:44,957 --> 01:15:46,481
<i># You don't know me</i>

1150
01:15:46,658 --> 01:15:48,319

1151

1152

1177
01:17:16,915 --> 01:17:19,543
<i># I'm stayin' right here</i>

1178
01:17:20,586 --> 01:17:23,919

1179
01:17:24,089 --> 01:17:26,922

1180
01:17:28,126 --> 01:17:29,923
<i># Can't stop me</i>

1181
01:17:30,095 --> 01:17:34,054
<i># It's not the end</i>

1182
01:17:37,202 --> 01:17:42,333
<i># You haven't seen the last of me</i>

1183
01:17:43,275 --> 01:17:48,713
<i># Oh, no, you haven't seen
The last of me</i>

1184
01:17:48,914 --> 01:17:53,476
<i># You haven't seen the last of me</i>

1185
01:18:14,106 --> 01:18:16,006
- Tess, we need to talk.
- No.

1186
01:18:16,174 --> 01:18:17,607
- Yes.
- I'm tired, Nikki.

1187
01:18:17,776 --> 01:18:19,471
Well, then you can just listen.

1188
01:18:19,645 --> 01:18:21,579
We built this club together...

1189
01:18:21,747 --> 01:18:24,147
...and then some girl shows up
from out of nowhere...

1190
01:18:24,316 --> 01:18:27,410
- ... who hasn't even paid her dues-
How do you know what dues she's paid?

1191
01:18:27,586 --> 01:18:30,282
This chick doesn't sing that way
because she's had it easy.

1192
01:18:30,455 --> 01:18:33,424
"They don't come
to hear us sing, Nikki."

1193
01:18:33,592 --> 01:18:36,186
Or is that just bullshit now?

1194
01:18:36,395 --> 01:18:38,590
You're drunk.
Go inside and call a cab.

1195
01:18:38,764 --> 01:18:41,198
I will not be upstaged
by some slut within months!

1196
01:18:41,366 --> 01:18:43,095
Then leave.

1197
01:18:44,736 --> 01:18:47,705
You'd ruin our friendship
over some girl you barely know?

1198
01:18:47,873 --> 01:18:49,033
So much for loyalty!

1199
01:18:49,207 --> 01:18:51,767
Since when did you know
anything about loyalty?

1200
01:18:51,943 --> 01:18:54,571
How many goddamn times
have I peeled you off the sidewalk?

1201
01:18:54,746 --> 01:18:55,770
How many blackouts?

1202
01:18:55,947 --> 01:18:57,938
How many times have I held
your head over the toilet bowl

1203
01:18:58,116 --> 01:19:00,516
...while you threw up everything
but your memories?

1204
01:19:00,686 --> 01:19:03,985
Okay, fine!
But I will not stand in the back!

1205
01:19:04,156 --> 01:19:05,444
Tess, you need to fix this-

1206
01:19:05,445 --> 01:19:08,456
You think you're my only problem?
I'm about to lose my club.

1207
01:19:08,466 --> 01:19:11,422
I'm about to lose the only thing
that means anything to me.

1208
01:19:11,596 --> 01:19:13,644
I have more to worry about
than trying to keep you

1209
01:19:13,645 --> 01:19:15,692
from pouring tequila on
your Cheerios.

1210
01:19:16,735 --> 01:19:19,163
Fine.

1211
01:19:19,671 --> 01:19:21,798
- I quit!
- I'm glad!

1212
01:19:25,977 --> 01:19:27,535
Nikki, don't drive.

1213
01:19:28,213 --> 01:19:29,703
By the way...

1214
01:19:30,082 --> 01:19:32,846
...I slept with Vince
the night after your honeymoon.

1215
01:19:45,997 --> 01:19:48,090
You crazy bitch!

1216
01:20:22,033 --> 01:20:23,057
Morning.

1217
01:20:23,935 --> 01:20:27,336
Do you really have to do that
at 6 a.m.?

1218
01:20:27,572 --> 01:20:28,630
Coffee?

1219
01:20:28,807 --> 01:20:31,901
No, but a little peace and quiet
would be nice.

1220
01:20:32,077 --> 01:20:34,671
You are a little overdressed
for breakfast.

1221
01:20:34,846 --> 01:20:37,747
My pajamas were in the bedroom,
which was occupied.

1222
01:20:37,916 --> 01:20:40,805
You're never here, so I figured it'd
be stupid for me to crash on the couch

1223
01:20:40,806 --> 01:20:44,781
when there is a perfectly good,
empty bed right there.

1224
01:20:47,058 --> 01:20:49,049
So, what do you want, the bedroom
back? Is that what you're saying?

1225
01:20:49,227 --> 01:20:50,592
Should be used by someone.

1226
01:20:50,762 --> 01:20:52,024
I'm home every night.

1227
01:20:52,197 --> 01:20:54,412
Maybe not when you think
I should be but last I checked,

1228
01:20:54,413 --> 01:20:56,395
you are my roommate, not my mother.

1229
01:20:56,568 --> 01:20:58,559
However, since it's such an issue...

1230
01:20:58,737 --> 01:21:02,036
What the hell. Take the bedroom.
I'll sleep on the couch.

1231
01:21:02,207 --> 01:21:03,299
- Fine!
- Fine.

1232
01:21:03,475 --> 01:21:06,035
- You're gonna have to move your shit.
- I realize that.

1233
01:21:06,211 --> 01:21:07,803
It is a total mess in there.

1234
01:21:07,979 --> 01:21:10,812
You got stuff everywhere.
Clothes, shoes, hair-

1235
01:21:10,982 --> 01:21:14,110
Jesus... Jack! What is your problem?
You're acting like a total prick.

1236
01:21:14,286 --> 01:21:15,776
Is there something you wanna say?

1237
01:21:15,954 --> 01:21:17,216
It's not just me.

1238
01:21:17,389 --> 01:21:19,914
The people that care about you,
are worried.

1239
01:21:20,292 --> 01:21:21,452
What people?

1240
01:21:21,626 --> 01:21:24,459
People, you know? People.
Your friends at the club.

1241
01:21:24,629 --> 01:21:25,857
We're like a family there.

1242
01:21:26,031 --> 01:21:27,726
And we look out for each other.

1243
01:21:27,899 --> 01:21:30,868
You all look out for each other.
Like Vince looks after Tess.

1244
01:21:31,036 --> 01:21:33,561
And like Nikki looks out
for everybody.

1245
01:21:33,738 --> 01:21:36,138
And Marcus?
He's gonna look out for you?

1246
01:21:37,576 --> 01:21:39,441
No, it's fine. It's fine.

1247
01:21:39,611 --> 01:21:41,772
He can make things happen for you.

1248
01:21:43,081 --> 01:21:45,208
So go ahead,
make a deal with the devil.

1249
01:21:45,383 --> 01:21:47,146
First of all, Marcus is not the devil.

1250
01:21:47,319 --> 01:21:48,946
He's a smart businessman who

1251
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:51,521
oodly enough happens to
be a gentleman

1252
01:21:51,522 --> 01:21:53,921
who knows what he wants
and he goes for it.

1253
01:21:54,092 --> 01:21:57,994
I'm just saying.
Life is about the choices you make.

1254
01:21:58,496 --> 01:22:00,123
The choices I make?

1255
01:22:00,298 --> 01:22:02,789
You're a
bartender-slash-piano player...

1256
01:22:02,968 --> 01:22:05,732
...who writes songs that
are never ready.

1257
01:22:06,179 --> 01:22:06,650
Wow!

1258
01:22:09,140 --> 01:22:11,438
That's perfect. Perfect.

1259
01:22:16,381 --> 01:22:19,748
Please, try not to destroy
my apartment. Thanks.

1260
01:22:21,620 --> 01:22:24,020
<i>I now pronounce you husband and wife.</i>

1261
01:22:24,189 --> 01:22:25,486
<i>You may kiss the bride.</i>

1262
01:22:32,797 --> 01:22:36,358
Wait, what do you mean
you are still in New York? Why?

1263
01:22:36,835 --> 01:22:39,326
So you just decided not to come?

1264
01:22:39,804 --> 01:22:43,968
Why does every conversation we've end
up being about you and your future?

1265
01:22:45,076 --> 01:22:46,304
You know what, you're right.

1266
01:22:46,478 --> 01:22:48,742
We should definitely start thinking
about our futures.

1267
01:22:48,914 --> 01:22:51,041
And I might just be looking at mine
right now.

1268
01:22:55,820 --> 01:22:57,344
That DJ is hot.

1269
01:22:57,522 --> 01:22:58,614
You think so?

1270
01:22:59,891 --> 01:23:01,756
He keeps looking at me.

1271
01:23:01,927 --> 01:23:03,690
Maybe he's cuckoo for Coco Puffs.

1272
01:23:03,862 --> 01:23:05,159
Really? You think?

1273
01:23:05,330 --> 01:23:06,661
Yeah. I think.

1274
01:23:08,600 --> 01:23:10,534
He's gorgeous. I think he likes me.

1275
01:23:10,835 --> 01:23:12,598
He is gorgeous.

1276
01:23:16,908 --> 01:23:20,674
Who is paying for this wedding anyway?
This rental must have cost a fortune.

1277
01:23:20,845 --> 01:23:22,745
Damon's dad is loaded.

1278
01:23:23,081 --> 01:23:24,343
Is he single?

1279
01:23:24,516 --> 01:23:27,349
I'm just kidding. I'm kidding.

1280
01:23:28,086 --> 01:23:30,577
Guess Georgia's not as dumb
as I thought.

1281
01:23:31,389 --> 01:23:33,755
Would you ever do this again?

1282
01:23:34,259 --> 01:23:35,521
No.

1283
01:23:35,694 --> 01:23:37,577
You know, there's
only one man that I can see

1284
01:23:37,578 --> 01:23:39,460
spending the rest of my life with.

1285
01:23:39,831 --> 01:23:45,064
And unfortunately, except for a really
drunk night in Reno 25,000 years ago-

1286
01:23:45,236 --> 01:23:46,897
...he bats for the other team.

1287
01:23:47,238 --> 01:23:50,036
Oh, no. He bats for the pink team.

1288
01:23:50,208 --> 01:23:51,698
<i>Yes, fâcheusement!</i>

1289
01:23:52,944 --> 01:23:54,434
<i>That is tragique.</i>

1290
01:23:54,612 --> 01:23:55,977
I know.

1291
01:23:56,581 --> 01:23:59,072
Well, it's like all
truly great love affairs.

1292
01:23:59,250 --> 01:24:00,979
Yeah.

1293
01:24:01,152 --> 01:24:02,380
Tragic.

1294
01:24:03,922 --> 01:24:06,550
It wasn't Reno. It was Tahoe, baby.

1295
01:24:06,725 --> 01:24:08,249
And it was lovely.

1296
01:24:09,060 --> 01:24:10,357
Get a room.

1297
01:24:10,528 --> 01:24:11,552
Get away.

1298
01:24:19,437 --> 01:24:21,405
Shot of Patrón, please.

1299
01:24:22,307 --> 01:24:24,275
Make it two. Make it two.

1300
01:24:25,377 --> 01:24:27,777
Looking kind of lonely there, Jack.

1301
01:24:27,946 --> 01:24:29,470
Liberated, maybe.

1302
01:24:30,148 --> 01:24:32,048
Libated, definitely.

1303
01:24:32,784 --> 01:24:35,275
But lonely, no. Never lonely.

1304
01:24:35,453 --> 01:24:36,613
Cheers.

1305
01:24:39,457 --> 01:24:40,481
Clink.

1306
01:24:47,198 --> 01:24:48,426
How's it going?

1307
01:24:48,600 --> 01:24:50,329
God. What are we, in junior high?

1308
01:24:50,502 --> 01:24:53,198
Iowa, are you still mad at me?

1309
01:24:53,671 --> 01:24:55,696
You know, because if you are...

1310
01:24:55,907 --> 01:24:57,135
...bring it on, baby.

1311
01:24:57,308 --> 01:24:58,332
Are you drunk?

1312
01:24:58,510 --> 01:25:01,343
Oh, I love this song. Yes!

1313
01:25:01,513 --> 01:25:03,140
Oh, you rock.

1314
01:25:03,314 --> 01:25:05,441
Yeah, baby. You rock.

1315
01:25:11,356 --> 01:25:14,052
I'm sorry for being a class-A prick.

1316
01:25:14,225 --> 01:25:15,624
You were.

1317
01:25:16,027 --> 01:25:17,221
I was.

1318
01:25:17,529 --> 01:25:20,555
And, as of about...

1319
01:25:22,500 --> 01:25:25,435
...some time ago,
I am officially a single man.

1320
01:25:26,004 --> 01:25:27,904
You and Natalie broke up?

1321
01:25:28,073 --> 01:25:29,165
That we did.

1322
01:25:29,340 --> 01:25:32,036
Which explains why I am here alone.

1323
01:25:32,477 --> 01:25:33,705
So...

1324
01:25:34,446 --> 01:25:36,846
...why are you here alone?

1325
01:25:38,083 --> 01:25:40,483
Do I really look alone to you?

1326
01:25:41,886 --> 01:25:43,080
Come here.

1327
01:25:44,322 --> 01:25:45,812
Jack.

1328
01:25:54,866 --> 01:25:56,163
Careful.

1329
01:25:58,336 --> 01:26:02,272
Oh, my feet are killing me.
Take off these shoes, please. Help me.

1330
01:26:02,474 --> 01:26:03,873
Wait, wait. Be careful.

1331
01:26:06,277 --> 01:26:08,040
I got it. No. No.

1332
01:26:10,582 --> 01:26:11,810
Stay.

1333
01:26:21,426 --> 01:26:22,450
Good night.

1334
01:26:23,294 --> 01:26:25,125
Here. Yeah.

1335
01:26:26,865 --> 01:26:28,059
Night.

1336
01:26:36,441 --> 01:26:37,738
Okay.

1337
01:26:39,878 --> 01:26:41,368
Cute jammies.

1338
01:26:41,613 --> 01:26:44,241
My mother got me these,
thank you very much.

1339
01:26:44,415 --> 01:26:46,542
And I haven't worn them yet, so...

1340
01:26:47,585 --> 01:26:48,950
Go figure.

1341
01:26:50,655 --> 01:26:52,213
I forgot to lock the door.

1342
01:26:54,292 --> 01:26:57,591
- Got it?
- Good.

1343
01:27:01,399 --> 01:27:02,923
Good night.

1344
01:27:03,635 --> 01:27:04,761
Good night.

1345
01:27:10,241 --> 01:27:11,265
Back again?

1346
01:27:11,442 --> 01:27:13,774
Water. Don't want a hangover.

1347
01:27:14,145 --> 01:27:15,544
Smart.

1348
01:27:28,326 --> 01:27:30,419
Good night. Again.

1349
01:27:32,263 --> 01:27:34,925
Night. Again.

1350
01:27:41,639 --> 01:27:45,097
Now, I know-
I know I forgot something else.

1351
01:27:45,276 --> 01:27:47,574
I remember I locked the door.

1352
01:27:48,446 --> 01:27:51,176
That's it. Hungry. I'm hungry.

1353
01:27:51,716 --> 01:27:53,013
Exactly.

1354
01:27:57,188 --> 01:27:59,782
- What is so funny?
- Jack! Well, you're-

1355
01:28:00,358 --> 01:28:02,349
Well, I never.

1356
01:28:05,230 --> 01:28:07,630
- Jack.
- Want a cookie?

1357
01:28:09,467 --> 01:28:10,525
No?

1358
01:28:11,236 --> 01:28:13,136
- All right.
- Jack.

1359
01:28:13,304 --> 01:28:16,171
It's your loss.
You change your mind...

1360
01:28:16,975 --> 01:28:18,408
...you know where they are.

1361
01:29:22,440 --> 01:29:27,874
<i># Sweet love</i>

1362
01:29:28,046 --> 01:29:30,310

<i># Free me, free us</i>

1367
01:29:55,707 --> 01:29:56,857
So it's official.

1368
01:29:57,283 --> 01:29:59,710
<i># You're all</i>

1369
01:29:59,711 --> 01:30:01,971
<i>- What?

1370
01:30:02,113 --> 01:30:05,391

01:30:08,715 --> 01:30:14,899
<i># away I will suffer tonight</i>

1373
01:30:14,959 --> 01:30:16,017
Natalie who?

1374
01:30:16,227 --> 01:30:20,254
<i># I found a man I can trust</i>

1375

1376
01:30:24,769 --> 01:30:31,766

01:30:59,949 --> 01:31:01,770
<i># I've faced on my own</i>

1383
01:31:01,773 --> 01:31:03,001
Do that again.

1384
01:31:03,253 --> 01:31:08,979
<i># Walls I built up became</i>

1385
01:31:08,980 --> 01:31:11,429

1386
01:31:12,329 --> 01:31:19,710
<i># I'm strong and I'm sure

1388
01:31:30,134 --> 01:31:37,762

1389
01:31:38,461 --> 01:31:47,750
<i># And I brace myself,

1390
01:31:47,819 --> 01:31:50,310
I mean, I don't really know
what happened.

1391
01:31:52,924 --> 01:31:58,021
I had won the Nashville Teen
Songwriting Contest.

1392
01:31:58,996 --> 01:32:01,021
I even still have my little trophy.

1393
01:32:01,199 --> 01:32:02,359
So I took that as-

1394
01:32:02,533 --> 01:32:05,866
I thought I was supposed to do
something important with my life.

1395
01:32:06,270 --> 01:32:07,965
Then I got to L.A.

1396
01:32:08,139 --> 01:32:09,970
And nothing happened.

1397
01:32:11,642 --> 01:32:12,904
Nothing.

1398
01:32:14,545 --> 01:32:16,069
Well, you know what?

1399
01:32:17,114 --> 01:32:19,480
I believe your music is ready.

1400
01:32:21,152 --> 01:32:22,983
The question is...

1401
01:32:25,256 --> 01:32:26,655
...are you ready?

1402
01:32:27,859 --> 01:32:30,054
- For what?
- Are you ready? Here I come.

1403
01:32:33,091 --> 01:32:35,242
<i># Suddenly the moment's here</i>

1404
01:32:35,418 --> 01:32:37,455

1408
01:32:50,645 --> 01:32:56,708

1409
01:32:56,817 --> 01:33:00,682

01:33:24,165 --> 01:33:33,244
<i># Ooh, I am... I'm bound to you</i>

1416
01:33:57,481 --> 01:33:58,846
- I knew it.
- Natalie.

1417
01:33:59,016 --> 01:34:01,883
You are a liar.
A pathetic, sneaky little liar!

1418
01:34:02,053 --> 01:34:03,247
What is she doing here?

1419
01:34:03,421 --> 01:34:05,889
I live here. What I wanna know is,
why you are here.

1420
01:34:06,190 --> 01:34:08,272
I can't believe I bought  your
bullshit. "She's nothing."

1421
01:34:08,273 --> 01:34:10,354
"She's just some girl that I worked
with. She's not even pretty."

1422
01:34:10,528 --> 01:34:13,019
Well, at least you were honest
about one thing.

1423
01:34:13,230 --> 01:34:14,720
- You said that?
- I did not.

1424
01:34:14,899 --> 01:34:16,161
- He did.
- No, I didn't.

1425
01:34:16,334 --> 01:34:18,700
- Yes, he said that.
- Look...

1426
01:34:19,103 --> 01:34:21,503
I'm sorry, could you just give me
some time-?

1427
01:34:21,839 --> 01:34:23,238
You're asking me to leave?

1428
01:34:23,407 --> 01:34:25,102
- No.
- Yes, you. I'm the fiancée.

1429
01:34:25,343 --> 01:34:27,406
You told me that you
broke it off with her.

1430
01:34:27,407 --> 01:34:27,868
I did.

1431
01:34:28,045 --> 01:34:30,036
You think you break up with
a girl like me over the phone?

1432
01:34:30,214 --> 01:34:31,562
I'm out of here.
You told me it was over.

1433
01:34:31,563 --> 01:34:33,363
No! Ali, Ali... please.

1434
01:34:34,070 --> 01:34:34,891
What, Jack?

1435
01:34:35,052 --> 01:34:36,644
- I am sorry.
- So am I.

1436
01:34:38,623 --> 01:34:39,715
I'm out.

1437
01:34:39,890 --> 01:34:41,092
Ali, Ali... wait. Please.

1438
01:34:46,864 --> 01:34:48,559
I must have the wrong apartment.

1439
01:34:48,733 --> 01:34:50,200
Who are you looking for?

1440
01:34:50,368 --> 01:34:52,529
- I'm looking for Sean.
- Sean.

1441
01:34:52,703 --> 01:34:53,863
What's he look like?

1442
01:34:54,372 --> 01:34:55,805
Yea high.

1443
01:34:56,374 --> 01:34:57,398
Shaved head.

1444
01:34:58,242 --> 01:35:00,403
Brown eyes. Glasses.

1445
01:35:00,578 --> 01:35:01,738
Sean.

1446
01:35:01,912 --> 01:35:04,005
I've been calling him John.

1447
01:35:05,950 --> 01:35:07,508
No, it's Sean.

1448
01:35:08,586 --> 01:35:09,610
Is that him?

1449
01:35:10,521 --> 01:35:11,545
Yeah.

1450
01:35:17,061 --> 01:35:18,585
Hi.

1451
01:35:21,032 --> 01:35:23,762
- What are you doing here?
- It's a long story.

1452
01:35:23,934 --> 01:35:25,367
I shouldn't have come here.

1453
01:35:25,536 --> 01:35:28,061
I see I've obviously
interrupted something.

1454
01:35:28,239 --> 01:35:29,399
Might be a bad time.

1455
01:35:29,573 --> 01:35:30,835
No, that's okay.

1456
01:35:31,042 --> 01:35:33,977
I'm sorry. Ali, did you meet...

1457
01:35:35,312 --> 01:35:37,644
- ... Mike?
- Close. My name is Mark.

1458
01:35:37,815 --> 01:35:39,407
Hi, Mark.

1459
01:35:41,318 --> 01:35:44,246
Sorry.

1460
01:35:45,456 --> 01:35:47,151
Does anybody want any coffee?

1461
01:35:47,324 --> 01:35:50,122
Yeah. Why don't I go make the coffee..

1462
01:35:50,695 --> 01:35:52,993
...and you guys get better acquainted.

1463
01:35:54,565 --> 01:35:56,965
Sorry. Did I call you Mike last night?

1464
01:35:59,270 --> 01:36:00,862
Yes. Yeah.

1465
01:36:01,072 --> 01:36:03,472
- But I called you John, so...
- Really?

1466
01:36:04,408 --> 01:36:05,432
You liked it.

1467
01:36:06,944 --> 01:36:09,139
John was my mother's name.

1468
01:36:16,721 --> 01:36:18,518
- Hey.
- Hey, gorgeous.

1469
01:36:21,158 --> 01:36:22,182
Hey, Marcus.

1470
01:36:22,693 --> 01:36:24,752
You okay? You sound down.

1471
01:36:24,929 --> 01:36:26,157
I've been better.

1472
01:36:26,330 --> 01:36:27,854
Well, I have just the cure.

1473
01:36:28,032 --> 01:36:29,363
<i>- What's that?
- Me.</i>

1474
01:36:29,800 --> 01:36:32,200
<i>Why don't you come over for dinner?</i>

1475
01:36:43,881 --> 01:36:45,610
Okay, well...

1476
01:36:46,884 --> 01:36:49,853
- Bye.
- Yeah, bye. You...

1477
01:36:51,522 --> 01:36:53,353
You take care...

1478
01:36:55,059 --> 01:36:57,892
- ... Sean.
- You too. Okay.

1479
01:37:02,433 --> 01:37:03,798
Okay, bye.

1480
01:37:05,069 --> 01:37:06,263
Is Ali here?

1481
01:37:06,437 --> 01:37:07,904
Ali left.

1482
01:37:08,339 --> 01:37:09,670
She went with Marcus.

1483
01:37:10,040 --> 01:37:11,064
Is that true?

1484
01:37:12,176 --> 01:37:13,234
Yeah.

1485
01:37:13,544 --> 01:37:15,671
- What?
- She left a couple hours ago.

1486
01:37:15,846 --> 01:37:18,838
I told you that opportunity
wouldn't knock forever.

1487
01:37:19,917 --> 01:37:22,511
You're right. It doesn't.

1488
01:37:26,557 --> 01:37:27,581
Hey.

1489
01:37:29,693 --> 01:37:30,887
You.

1490
01:37:31,061 --> 01:37:32,187
It's Mark.

1491
01:37:33,464 --> 01:37:34,897
Mark.

1492
01:37:35,733 --> 01:37:37,360
Do you want to have some lunch?

1493
01:37:38,202 --> 01:37:39,999
Yeah. Sure.

1494
01:37:42,072 --> 01:37:43,699
You're cooking.

1495
01:37:45,609 --> 01:37:48,100
I just wasted my whole
goddamn afternoon...

1496
01:37:48,279 --> 01:37:51,214
...talking with
the vice president of loans.

1497
01:37:51,582 --> 01:37:54,745
This asshole- No, wait.
He didn't even look me in the eye.

1498
01:37:54,919 --> 01:37:58,719
He just sat there, playing with
this wooden thingy on his desk.

1499
01:37:58,889 --> 01:38:02,586
- What thingy? What?
- The long wooden block thingy.

1500
01:38:02,760 --> 01:38:03,784
The nameplate?

1501
01:38:03,961 --> 01:38:05,895
Yes. Nameplate.

1502
01:38:06,263 --> 01:38:07,594
Yeah, and?

1503
01:38:07,765 --> 01:38:09,756
And he's not gonna give me the money.

1504
01:38:10,301 --> 01:38:12,963
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

1505
01:38:13,137 --> 01:38:14,764
I'm not a good risk.

1506
01:38:14,939 --> 01:38:18,375
And I've got two days
before the bank takes the club.

1507
01:38:18,809 --> 01:38:21,175
Well, then...

1508
01:38:22,213 --> 01:38:24,807
...I would say that the situation
is pretty bleak.

1509
01:38:25,249 --> 01:38:28,707
And I would say that you are a master
of the fucking obvious.

1510
01:38:29,019 --> 01:38:30,577
Why did you say that?

1511
01:38:30,754 --> 01:38:34,155
What do you mean, "Why did I
say that"? Because it's the truth.

1512
01:38:34,325 --> 01:38:36,725
Tess, it's not a judgment,
it's the truth.

1513
01:38:36,894 --> 01:38:38,225
You don't have any money.

1514
01:38:38,395 --> 01:38:41,262
The bank won't give you a loan.
It's the eleventh hour.

1515
01:38:41,432 --> 01:38:42,922
Hello?

1516
01:38:45,536 --> 01:38:48,004
If I were you,
I would take Marcus's offer right now.

1517
01:38:48,172 --> 01:38:49,196
No.

1518
01:38:49,373 --> 01:38:51,773
And you don't get to say that to me.

1519
01:38:52,309 --> 01:38:56,643
I can take "the sky is falling" from
everyone else, but not you.

1520
01:38:57,181 --> 01:39:00,014
You know, I need you to be the one
that says:

1521
01:39:00,317 --> 01:39:02,148
"It's only a number, Tess."

1522
01:39:03,287 --> 01:39:05,915
We have killed ourselves trying
to keep this place going.

1523
01:39:06,090 --> 01:39:07,523
How can you just walk away?

1524
01:39:08,893 --> 01:39:11,862
I don't care if you walk away,
I don't care what happens.

1525
01:39:12,029 --> 01:39:14,691
I will beat down the door
of every bank in L.A.

1526
01:39:14,865 --> 01:39:17,129
I will never give up this club.

1527
01:39:18,102 --> 01:39:19,126
Are you sure?

1528
01:39:19,303 --> 01:39:21,362
I will never give it up.

1529
01:39:25,809 --> 01:39:27,174
There she is.

1530
01:39:27,678 --> 01:39:31,170
I thought I'd lost you for a minute
at the beginning there.

1531
01:39:33,083 --> 01:39:35,381
You are such an asshole.

1532
01:39:35,586 --> 01:39:37,076
Thank you.

1533
01:40:11,855 --> 01:40:12,981
Hope you're hungry.

1534
01:40:13,157 --> 01:40:14,590
Steaks are on.

1535
01:40:14,758 --> 01:40:16,191
What is this?

1536
01:40:17,127 --> 01:40:18,389
Right now it's a model.

1537
01:40:18,562 --> 01:40:21,190
When it grows up
it'll be multi-use space...

1538
01:40:21,365 --> 01:40:22,627
...residential, retail.

1539
01:40:22,833 --> 01:40:24,733
But this is the address of
the Burlesque Lounge.

1540
01:40:24,902 --> 01:40:26,961
Best view on the Sunset Strip...

1541
01:40:27,137 --> 01:40:29,002
...with no windows.

1542
01:40:30,441 --> 01:40:33,035
When I'm through with it,
it'll have a thousand.

1543
01:40:33,377 --> 01:40:34,742
Does Tess know about this?

1544
01:40:34,912 --> 01:40:37,327
Tess knows I've made an
offer to buy her space.

1545
01:40:37,337 --> 01:40:38,865
What makes you think she'd ever sell?

1546
01:40:39,058 --> 01:40:40,667
I don't think she has a choice.
She's going under.

1547
01:40:40,668 --> 01:40:42,275
I've made a very generous offer.

1548
01:40:42,453 --> 01:40:46,082
It's a win-win situation for everyone.
It's business, baby, not personal.

1549
01:40:46,256 --> 01:40:47,951
I think it's pretty personal for Tess.

1550
01:40:48,625 --> 01:40:51,059
And for Coco and Sean and...

1551
01:40:51,228 --> 01:40:52,888
- What about me?
- Hey, hey, hey. Listen,

1552
01:40:53,221 --> 01:40:56,090
There are other clubs that you can
sing and dance in. Better ones.

1553
01:40:56,767 --> 01:40:58,132
You don't get it.

1554
01:40:58,569 --> 01:41:02,232
I don't understand. I'm trying to do
something that benefits everyone.

1555
01:41:02,406 --> 01:41:05,739
- How does that make me the bad guy?
- It doesn't, Marcus.

1556
01:41:06,744 --> 01:41:08,939
It just makes you the wrong guy.

1557
01:41:35,105 --> 01:41:36,299
Hi.

1558
01:41:37,941 --> 01:41:39,806
So how'd it go at the bank?

1559
01:41:40,344 --> 01:41:41,709
This good.

1560
01:41:44,848 --> 01:41:46,213
You want a glass for that?

1561
01:41:46,383 --> 01:41:49,147
No, no. I am way beyond a glass.

1562
01:41:50,454 --> 01:41:52,979
- Tess, I gotta talk to you.
- Honey, not right now.

1563
01:41:53,157 --> 01:41:56,490
Marcus is gonna tear down the club
and build a skyscraper.

1564
01:41:57,194 --> 01:41:58,559
And how do you know this?

1565
01:41:58,729 --> 01:42:00,362
- I saw the model.
- I didn't know that you

1566
01:42:00,363 --> 01:42:01,994
and Marcus were that close.

1567
01:42:02,166 --> 01:42:04,498
We're not that close. I rushed
over here, so I could tell you.

1568
01:42:04,668 --> 01:42:07,034
Don't you think you're spreading
yourself a little bit thin.

1569
01:42:07,204 --> 01:42:10,002
Jack, Marcus, whoever.

1570
01:42:10,174 --> 01:42:12,506
Tess, I'm trying to help you.

1571
01:42:12,676 --> 01:42:14,371
- Ali, let it go.
- She's gotta listen to me.

1572
01:42:14,545 --> 01:42:15,978
Okay. Go! Let it go, let it go.

1573
01:42:16,146 --> 01:42:18,307
- She needs to listen to me.
- She can't right now.

1574
01:42:18,482 --> 01:42:21,042
Well, she's gonna hear me. Watch this.

1575
01:42:22,753 --> 01:42:24,118
Tess, I gotta talk to you.

1576
01:42:24,288 --> 01:42:27,663
You could knock.
This is still my office for 48 hours.

1577
01:42:27,664 --> 01:42:28,496
Well, then you really need to hear

1578
01:42:28,497 --> 01:42:29,685
- what I have tell you.
- No, I don't.

1579
01:42:29,765 --> 01:42:31,718
I am tired of talking.
I am talked out.

1580
01:42:31,895 --> 01:42:34,261
- This time you're gonna hear me out.
- No, I don't wanna hear you out.

1581
01:42:34,465 --> 01:42:37,730
Do you ever listen to anything other
than the sound of your own voice?

1582
01:42:44,775 --> 01:42:45,969
Talk.

1583
01:42:46,710 --> 01:42:48,678
Have you ever heard of air rights?

1584
01:42:49,113 --> 01:42:53,072
No, I've never heard of air rights.
What are air rights?

1585
01:43:15,706 --> 01:43:16,798
Now, that's funny.

1586
01:43:17,941 --> 01:43:19,966
Jim, let me call you back, huh?

1587
01:43:22,579 --> 01:43:23,705
Please sit down, ladies.

1588
01:43:23,881 --> 01:43:26,873
A few years ago you wanted to buy
my club and I said no.

1589
01:43:27,050 --> 01:43:29,018
Yeah, and now you changed your mind?

1590
01:43:29,186 --> 01:43:31,450
No, no but just bear with me
for a second...

1591
01:43:31,622 --> 01:43:35,285
...because I promise this is gonna
have a happy ending for both of us.

1592
01:43:35,492 --> 01:43:37,892
How much are you planning
to sell your condos for?

1593
01:43:38,462 --> 01:43:43,229
Well, they start at a million and go
up from there, depending on the view.

1594
01:43:43,700 --> 01:43:44,894
That's beautiful.

1595
01:43:45,068 --> 01:43:49,471
So, what if I told you
that a 20-story office building...

1596
01:43:49,640 --> 01:43:51,369
...was going up where my club is?

1597
01:43:52,743 --> 01:43:54,142
That would block his view.

1598
01:43:54,311 --> 01:43:56,802
- Ten stories would block his view.
- Yeah. Gone.

1599
01:43:57,014 --> 01:44:00,745
The way I see it, your beautiful
million-dollar ocean and city views...

1600
01:44:00,918 --> 01:44:02,977
...are just gonna vanish
into thin air.

1601
01:44:03,153 --> 01:44:04,245
- Vanish.
- Yeah.

1602
01:44:04,421 --> 01:44:08,016
Because tomorrow I am going to
sell my club to this developer...

1603
01:44:08,192 --> 01:44:10,257
...and his 20 stories are
gonna be well

1604
01:44:10,258 --> 01:44:12,322
underway by the time
you start selling.

1605
01:44:12,496 --> 01:44:14,521
- Trying to sell.
- Yeah. Right.

1606
01:44:14,698 --> 01:44:17,758
And so I think that we should talk.

1607
01:44:18,569 --> 01:44:19,661
I'd listen to her.

1608
01:44:36,687 --> 01:44:39,212
We're gonna have to
auction off everything.

1609
01:44:39,389 --> 01:44:41,289
Anything you want me to
try and keep for you?

1610
01:44:41,458 --> 01:44:42,755
No.

1611
01:44:43,260 --> 01:44:45,922
I just wanna try and do what's best
for both of us.

1612
01:44:47,364 --> 01:44:48,991
You gonna shoot me? Please?

1613
01:44:49,199 --> 01:44:51,292
No. I'm gonna buy you out.

1614
01:44:51,468 --> 01:44:53,299
In the next 24 hours?

1615
01:44:53,537 --> 01:44:56,301
No, in the next 24 seconds.

1616
01:45:05,582 --> 01:45:06,776
Where did you get this?

1617
01:45:07,551 --> 01:45:08,609
Thin air.

1618
01:45:10,621 --> 01:45:11,815
Oh, baby.

1619
01:45:14,191 --> 01:45:15,658
Thank you.

1620
01:45:21,265 --> 01:45:23,130
Just put it out in the universe.

1621
01:45:36,280 --> 01:45:39,249
What would really make me so happy...

1622
01:45:40,150 --> 01:45:41,481
...is to hear from you...

1623
01:45:41,718 --> 01:45:45,654
...a great, big, giant, fat:

1624
01:45:45,822 --> 01:45:47,380
"Thank you, Ali."

1625
01:46:02,973 --> 01:46:05,908
I didn't really sleep with Vince,
I just said that to hurt you.

1626
01:46:08,478 --> 01:46:09,604
I crossed the line.

1627
01:46:09,980 --> 01:46:11,004
You think?

1628
01:46:14,017 --> 01:46:15,609
I wanna come home.

1629
01:46:20,257 --> 01:46:21,690
Okay, you're home.

1630
01:46:23,026 --> 01:46:26,553
Now get your crazy ass upstairs and
get ready, you're on in 20 minutes.

1631
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:33,333
And if you ever pull half of the crap
that she pulled...

1632
01:46:33,503 --> 01:46:37,030
..you are gonna be out on your ass so
quick it's gonna make your head spin.

1633
01:46:37,207 --> 01:46:38,834
Yes, ma'am.

1634
01:46:41,078 --> 01:46:44,104
And don't ever call me "ma'am" again.

1635
01:46:44,648 --> 01:46:46,946
I'm gonna go get dressed
for the show.

1636
01:46:50,220 --> 01:46:51,881
Thank you, Ali.

1637
01:46:59,830 --> 01:47:02,560
So, this is what happens
when you get a little money, huh?

1638
01:47:02,733 --> 01:47:04,200
You stop doing manual labor.

1639
01:47:04,368 --> 01:47:06,336
I'm back there with broken zippers...

1640
01:47:06,503 --> 01:47:09,301
...and ostrich feather fans
that won't open or close.

1641
01:47:09,473 --> 01:47:11,839
You have no idea what it's like.
No idea.

1642
01:47:12,008 --> 01:47:14,272
I quit. Quit.

1643
01:48:02,058 --> 01:48:05,585
- Can I use this?
- Don't touch my stuff.

1644
01:48:17,441 --> 01:48:18,999
I've been looking for you.

1645
01:48:21,812 --> 01:48:23,245
Well, you found me.

1646
01:48:24,448 --> 01:48:25,449
I wanna talk to you.

1647
01:48:25,459 --> 01:48:27,249
Jack, I really have to
get ready, okay.

1648
01:48:27,417 --> 01:48:29,851
I know I messed up, okay? Big-time.

1649
01:48:30,020 --> 01:48:33,251
When? When you lied to me
about your engagement being over...

1650
01:48:33,423 --> 01:48:35,618
...or when you kicked me out
of your apartment?

1651
01:48:35,792 --> 01:48:38,192
It really was over. Okay?
And she's gone.

1652
01:48:39,996 --> 01:48:42,191
I'm here to apologize.

1653
01:48:45,535 --> 01:48:47,196
No, no. Hey.

1654
01:48:48,805 --> 01:48:52,241
I never should have let you
walk out that door.

1655
01:48:55,846 --> 01:48:57,143
Go on.

1656
01:48:57,714 --> 01:48:59,477
I want you to come back.

1657
01:49:06,923 --> 01:49:09,653
So, what's the proposal, exactly?

1658
01:49:13,864 --> 01:49:15,195
Well...

1659
01:49:15,699 --> 01:49:18,224
...I still have that full box
of cookies.

1660
01:49:19,669 --> 01:49:21,296
And an empty day bed.

1661
01:49:23,039 --> 01:49:24,666
I want the bedroom.

1662
01:49:27,210 --> 01:49:28,370
Half.

1663
01:49:31,815 --> 01:49:34,943
So are you in or are you out?

1664
01:49:35,685 --> 01:49:37,277
Oh, Jack. Now, see...

1665
01:49:37,821 --> 01:49:43,020
...I'm the kind of girl that,
when a friend's in trouble, I help.

1666
01:49:43,193 --> 01:49:44,888
That's just who I am.

1667
01:49:45,061 --> 01:49:46,323
Shut up.

1668
01:50:09,352 --> 01:50:11,183
Okay, then. All right.

1669
01:50:15,358 --> 01:50:16,848
I...

1670
01:50:18,128 --> 01:50:19,595
I finished a song.

1671
01:50:20,297 --> 01:50:22,094
I think it's pretty good.

1672
01:50:24,801 --> 01:50:27,099
- Can I hear it?
- No.

1673
01:50:32,943 --> 01:50:34,638
But you can sing it.

1674
01:50:43,787 --> 01:50:46,517
<i># Underneath the city lights</i>
