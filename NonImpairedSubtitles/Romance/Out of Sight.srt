1
00:01:25,685 --> 00:01:29,587
- You have a loan app? Wonderful.
- Yeah. Terrific.

2
00:01:38,164 --> 00:01:43,431
My wife and I were having dinner
the other night... recently married.

3
00:01:51,177 --> 00:01:53,839
- How can I help you, sir?
- Loretta...

4
00:01:53,913 --> 00:01:58,646
see the man talking
to your bank manager has his case open?

5
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:01,243
Oh, that's Mr. Gwendon,
one of our assistant managers.

6
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:03,414
Our manager is Mr. Schoen,
but he's not in today.

7
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:06,391
- But you see the man with the briefcase.
- Yes.

8
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:08,757
That's my partner.
He has a gun in there.

9
00:02:08,828 --> 00:02:12,423
If you don't do exactly
what I tell you or if you give me
any kind of problem at all...

10
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:16,492
I'm going to look at my partner
and he's going to shoot your
Mr. Gwendon between the eyes.

11
00:02:20,406 --> 00:02:22,874
Okay.

12
00:02:22,942 --> 00:02:28,471
All right, take one of those big
envelopes and put as many 100s,
50s and 20s as you can into it.

13
00:02:28,548 --> 00:02:32,951
Nothing with bank straps
or rubber bands. I don't want
dye packs. I don't want bait money.

14
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:36,546
Start with the second drawer,
and then the one over there,
under the money counter.

15
00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:43,929
Okay. It's okay. Come on, Loretta.
Key's right next to you.

16
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:45,931
There you go.

17
00:02:51,237 --> 00:02:54,138
No bills off the bottom
of the drawer, please.

18
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,205
This your first time
being robbed?

19
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:07,219
You're doing great. Just smile so you
don't look like you're being held up.

20
00:03:08,721 --> 00:03:10,985
You got a very pretty smile.

21
00:03:11,057 --> 00:03:13,525
You got 20s? Give me the 20s.
I'll take those.

22
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:15,527
There you go.
I'll put those in my pocket.

23
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:18,630
There you go.

24
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:23,229
I have to give my partner a sign.
Now, that's good.

25
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:27,103
He's gonna wait
until I'm out of the building,
make sure you haven't set off the alarm.

26
00:03:27,173 --> 00:03:31,576
If you have, he's gonna shoot your
Mr. Gwendon between the eyes. Okay?

27
00:03:31,644 --> 00:03:35,375
- Okay.
- I think that'll do it, Loretta.

28
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:38,076
Thank you.
Have a nice day.

29
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:40,415
You too.

30
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:49,586
Hey... she's cute, isn't she?

31
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:51,596
Yeah, she seems very nice.

32
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:55,767
Who was that?

33
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,695
No, no, no, no, no.

34
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:34,604
Son of a bitch!

35
00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:37,472
Fuck! Fuck!

36
00:04:37,543 --> 00:04:41,604
I think you flooded it.
Get out of the car, sir.

37
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:45,811
- Hey, you wanna hear a funny story?
- Shut up and get out of the car!

38
00:04:45,885 --> 00:04:50,015
Yeah. Okay.

39
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:18,515
Go, go, go!

40
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:26,313
You want somethin', Foley?

41
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:30,220
Some fellas are goin' out of here.
What if I tell you where and when?

42
00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:33,622
- How many?
- Expect you to look out for me,
let me run off work detail...

43
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:36,093
Okay, okay.
How many goin' out?

44
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:38,153
- I hear six.
- When?

45
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:41,428
- Tonight.
- You know who they are?

46
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:44,265
Yes, I do.
But I'm not gonna tell you just yet.

47
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:47,431
Meet me in the chapel,
just before lockdown. Okay?

48
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:57,215
- You all right?
- I love you, baby.

49
00:06:57,283 --> 00:07:00,116
Tonight's the big night.
You excited?

50
00:07:01,854 --> 00:07:05,984
- It's Super Bowl Sunday, okay?
- See you moved it up.

51
00:07:06,058 --> 00:07:09,152
- Why you think that?
- I saw you runnin' this mornin'.

52
00:07:09,228 --> 00:07:11,719
Stickin' to your routine
in case anybody happened to notice.

53
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:15,290
But you only did a couple of miles,
instead of your usual five.

54
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:19,498
Saving yourself for the big event. What
happened? Finish ahead of schedule?

55
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:22,405
Mira, you see those posts out there?

56
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:27,276
They're putting up another fence
15 feet back the fence that's
already there, you know?

57
00:07:27,346 --> 00:07:30,747
So you figure, mira,
we wait till Super Bowl Sunday,
they have that fence built...

58
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:33,911
then, cono, we gotta dig what,
another nine, ten days, baby?

59
00:07:33,986 --> 00:07:35,920
- Yeah.
- I don't think so.

60
00:07:35,988 --> 00:07:41,551
So tonight, when it gets dark,
batta-bing, I'm outta here.
Come on, Foley. You could come.

61
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:45,256
I appreciate the offer,
and it's tempting.

62
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:48,129
It's a long run to civilization.
What's it? A hundred miles to Miami?

63
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:51,568
I'm too old to be tryin'
a stunt like that.

64
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:54,367
So, you send me a postcard
when you get out.

65
00:08:06,853 --> 00:08:11,381
- Adele Delisi speaking.
- Will you accept a collect call
from Jack Foley?

66
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:14,459
Yeah, I'll accept.

67
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:17,553
- Hey, Adele, how you doin'?
- Hey, bank robber.

68
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:22,226
Want some advice? Next time,
keep the engine running.

69
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:25,737
- Huh-huh. That's funny!
- What do you want, Jack?

70
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:31,141
Adele, you know that Super Bowl party
that was for next Sunday?

71
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:33,974
They changed the date.
It's tonight at 6:30.

72
00:08:34,046 --> 00:08:38,676
- Didn't you tell me one time
calls aren't monitored?
- I said, not as a rule.

73
00:08:38,751 --> 00:08:41,413
So why don't you just come right out
and tell me what you're talkin' about?

74
00:08:41,487 --> 00:08:45,218
- Listen to Miss Smarty Mouth,
out there in the free world.
- Oh, yeah, what's free about it?

75
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:47,384
I'm lookin' for work.

76
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:52,329
- What about Mandrake the Magician?
- Emil, The Amazing, huh?

77
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:56,459
He fired me.
Hired a younger girl... a redhead.

78
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:59,699
Adele, the reason I'm calling...
they changed the date.

79
00:08:59,772 --> 00:09:03,401
It is tonight. It's 6:30.
That's like a few hours from now.

80
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:06,104
- You tell Buddy...
- Okay, all right, and the guy
driving the other car?

81
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:10,444
- What are you talking about?
- Well, seeing as you have
so much luck with cars...

82
00:09:10,516 --> 00:09:13,246
Buddy thought it might be
better to bring two, you know?

83
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:15,480
He got this guy who says
you know him, from Lompoc...

84
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:18,285
- Uh, Glenn somebody...
- Glenn Michaels.

85
00:09:18,357 --> 00:09:22,225
Uh-huh, that's him. Buddy said
Glenn thinks you guys are real cool.

86
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:24,229
- Adele?
- Yeah?

87
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:28,631
You tell Buddy I see Glenn wearing
his sunglasses, I'm gonna step on 'em.

88
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:31,864
- Might not even take 'em off first.
- Okay, honey. I'll do that.

89
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:34,202
Now, you try not to get shot. Bye.

90
00:09:34,273 --> 00:09:36,207
Hey...

91
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:00,498
Here, ma'am.
Let me help you with these.

92
00:10:00,566 --> 00:10:02,659
Beautiful young lady like you
shouldn't be carrying groceries.

93
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:05,568
Let a man do that for you.

94
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:11,838
Now, I didn't ask for your help,
so don't expect a tip.

95
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:16,814
Oh, that's okay, ma'am.
I'll just take your car.

96
00:10:16,882 --> 00:10:19,112
Happy birthday.

97
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:21,483
Did you fit another
Chanel suit in here?

98
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:23,784
Something much better.
Go ahead, open it.

99
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:34,629
Oh, my God.
It's beautiful.

100
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,464
- It's a, um...
- Sig Sauer 380.

101
00:10:37,536 --> 00:10:42,439
- Right.
- Oh, I love it!

102
00:10:42,508 --> 00:10:44,442
Thanks, Dad.

103
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:46,637
Happy birthday.

104
00:10:46,712 --> 00:10:48,680
- How 'bout some more coffee?
- You know, I can't.

105
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:53,344
I have to go out to Glades, and then
I'm meeting Ray Nicolet at 10:00.

106
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:56,013
Which one is that?
The A.T.F. Guy?

107
00:10:56,088 --> 00:10:59,649
Actually, he's with the F.B.I. Now.
He switched over.

108
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:04,059
- He's still married, though.
- Technically. They're separated.

109
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:06,564
- Well, so he's moved out then.
- He's about to.

110
00:11:06,632 --> 00:11:10,693
- Well, then they're
not separated, are they?
- Can we not talk about this?

111
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:16,472
- What are you doing at Glades?
- Serving process...
a summons and complaint.

112
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:19,534
Some con doing mandatory life
doesn't like macaroni and cheese.

113
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:24,345
So, he files suit. Says he doesn't have
any choice in what they serve...

114
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:26,851
and that violates
his civil rights.

115
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:32,221
- You can step in, work full-time
as one of my investigators.
- No, thanks.

116
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:34,589
- You used to like it.
- Dad.

117
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:39,359
You'd meet doctors, lawyers... nothing
wrong with them, if they're divorced.

118
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:44,131
Karen, why waste your time
on some cowboy cop...

119
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:46,171
who drinks too much
and cheats on his wife?

120
00:11:46,238 --> 00:11:48,832
That's how those hot shots are...
all of 'em!

121
00:11:48,908 --> 00:11:50,842
I really gotta go.

122
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:57,410
We don't talk much anymore.

123
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:03,945
How 'bout I come over Sunday
and we watch the Super Bowl together?

124
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:05,991
I'd like that.

125
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:08,890
Thanks for the gun, Dad.

126
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:26,170
They're right underneath you, Pup.
They dug a tunnel.

127
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:31,877
I don't hear anything.
Where's the tunnel come out?

128
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:34,784
Fourth post
from the guard tower.

129
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:37,049
I don't see nothin'.

130
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:39,057
You just keep watchin'.

131
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,908
Federal Bureau of Investigation,
how may I direct your call?

132
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:06,508
Yeah, this is Karen Sisco again
for Ray Nicolet.

133
00:13:06,585 --> 00:13:08,678
Hold, please.

134
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:10,688
Yeah.

135
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:33,768
The line is busy.
Would you like his voice mail?

136
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:37,111
No, forget it.
I'll call back later.

137
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:39,117
- All right.
- Thanks.

138
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:42,353
Still don't see anything.

139
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:47,117
You will directly.

140
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:52,053
Wait a minute.

141
00:14:12,651 --> 00:14:14,516
What the fuck?

142
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:31,166
Two men by the fence!

143
00:14:48,787 --> 00:14:51,119
What the hell is she doin'?

144
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:02,759
Stop! Get your hands
in the air!

145
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:23,913
Tunnel's clear.
Seal up the north face.

146
00:15:23,989 --> 00:15:27,481
- What happened?
- What the hell do you think,
jackass? Got a jail break!

147
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:31,222
Cubans out in the cane. Don't point
that thing at me. Hey, Buddy.

148
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:35,461
- It's okay, we're the good guys.
- What are you doing here?

149
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:39,436
All right. You're just a girl. What do
you do for a living you pack a shotgun?

150
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:44,340
- I'm a federal marshal
and you're under arrest.
- That's probably all the hacks.

151
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:46,776
Why don't we talk
about this later?

152
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:50,348
Watch your head.

153
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,247
I'm in. Let's go!

154
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:57,820
- Hey! You comfy?
- If I could have a little more room...

155
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:59,824
Well, there isn't any.

156
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:02,918
We got a lot of shit in here.
We got handcuffs in here.

157
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:05,589
What's in this can?

158
00:16:05,664 --> 00:16:08,599
That's for your breath. You could
use it... squirt some in your mouth.

159
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:10,658
Yeah, well, that's mace, isn't it?

160
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:20,402
All right, you! Get...

161
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:26,315
Hey. Where's your gun... pistol?

162
00:16:26,385 --> 00:16:29,445
In my bag, in the car.

163
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:41,799
Boy, it stunk in there.

164
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:45,633
I believe it. You're ruining
a $900 suit my dad gave me.

165
00:16:45,704 --> 00:16:48,264
Yeah, it went great
with that 12-gauge too.

166
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,604
Why in the world would someone like you
become a federal marshal?

167
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:53,702
- The idea of going after
guys like you appealed to me.
- Sorry, what was that?

168
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:55,906
Guys like me?
Let me tell you something.

169
00:16:55,981 --> 00:16:59,212
Even though I've been celibate lately,
I'm not going to force myself on you.

170
00:16:59,284 --> 00:17:01,912
- I've never done that in my life.
- You wouldn't have time, anyway.

171
00:17:01,987 --> 00:17:05,388
We come to a roadblock, they run the car
and find out who it belongs to.

172
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:08,756
That's if they get set up in time,
which I doubt. If they do...

173
00:17:08,827 --> 00:17:12,820
they'll be lookin' for a bunch
of little Latin fellas, not
a big black guy drivin' a Ford.

174
00:17:12,898 --> 00:17:16,026
He must be quite a pal,
to risk his own ass like this.

175
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:18,126
Buddy? Yeah, he's a good guy.

176
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:23,436
Back when we jailed together,
he used to call his sister
every week, without fail.

177
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:27,240
She's a born-again Christian. She does
bookkeeping for a televangelist.

178
00:17:27,312 --> 00:17:29,246
He'd call her up,
confess his sins.

179
00:17:29,314 --> 00:17:31,578
He'd tell her whatever bank
he happened to rob at the time.

180
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:33,743
Buddy... that
his given name?

181
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:36,253
The one I gave him, yeah.

182
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:39,586
So, what's your name?

183
00:17:39,658 --> 00:17:42,058
Be in the paper
tomorrow, anyway.

184
00:17:42,127 --> 00:17:45,358
Jack Foley.
You've probably heard of me.

185
00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:48,662
- Why? Are you famous?
- The time I was convicted
in California...

186
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:53,671
the F.B.I. Told me that I'd robbed
more banks than anybody in the computer.

187
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:56,401
- How many was that?
- Tell you the truth,
I don't really know.

188
00:17:56,475 --> 00:18:01,879
Started when I was 18 years old,
driving for my Uncle Cully,
and his partner, Gus.

189
00:18:01,947 --> 00:18:06,543
So, basically you're saying
you spent half your life in prison.

190
00:18:06,618 --> 00:18:09,280
Basically, yeah.
I go back, I do 30 years. No time off.

191
00:18:09,354 --> 00:18:14,382
- You imagine lookin' at that?
- I don't have to. I don't rob banks.

192
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:18,963
You don't seem all that scared.

193
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:22,762
- Of course I am.
- You don't act like it.

194
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:24,769
What do you want me
to do, scream?

195
00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:26,930
That wouldn't help much, anyway.

196
00:18:27,005 --> 00:18:32,671
No, I'm just gonna sit here, take it
easy, and wait for you to screw up.

197
00:18:32,744 --> 00:18:35,110
You sound like my ex-wife.

198
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:39,640
- You were married?
- Just for about a year,
give or take a few days.

199
00:18:39,718 --> 00:18:42,585
It's not like we didn't get along...
we had fun. We just...

200
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:46,249
didn't have... that thing,
you know, that uh...

201
00:18:46,325 --> 00:18:51,092
- That spark, you know?
Gotta have that.
- Mm-hmm.

202
00:18:51,163 --> 00:18:53,461
- We still talk, though.
- Sure.

203
00:18:56,368 --> 00:18:58,962
This is not gonna end well.
These things never do.

204
00:18:59,037 --> 00:19:01,835
If it turns out I get shot like
a dog, it's gonna be in the street...

205
00:19:01,907 --> 00:19:03,966
not off a goddamn fence.

206
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:07,705
You must really see yourself
as some kind of Clyde Barrow, huh?

207
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:15,185
- You mean, of Bonnie and Clyde?
- Yeah.

208
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:22,622
The part in the movie where they get
shot, when it's Warren Beatty and...

209
00:19:22,694 --> 00:19:25,219
- Faye Dunaway.
- Faye Dunaway, yeah.

210
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:29,563
- I like her in that movie about TV.
- Network, yeah, she was good.

211
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:32,729
And that guy says he's not gonna
take any more shit from anybody.

212
00:19:32,804 --> 00:19:35,398
- Peter Finch.
- Yeah! Peter Finch.

213
00:19:35,474 --> 00:19:39,501
"I'm mad as hell, and I'm not
gonna take any more of your shit!"

214
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:44,312
In that part where they get shot,
I can remember thinkin' to myself...

215
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:49,582
thinkin', "Hey, that wouldn't be
such a bad way to go, if you had to."

216
00:20:09,808 --> 00:20:11,742
You sure are easy to talk to.

217
00:20:15,814 --> 00:20:20,683
I was thinkin', if we met
under different circumstances...

218
00:20:20,752 --> 00:20:24,381
if you were in a bar and
I came up and we started talkin'...

219
00:20:24,456 --> 00:20:27,016
- I wonder what would happen.
- Nothing.

220
00:20:27,092 --> 00:20:30,220
- If you didn't know who I was.
- You'd probably tell me.

221
00:20:30,295 --> 00:20:33,492
- Just saying if we met
under different circumstances...
- You have got to be kidding.

222
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:36,534
Yeah. Yeah.

223
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:41,471
Another movie I liked with Faye Dunaway
was Three Days of the Condor.

224
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:44,202
The one with Robert Redford
when he was young.

225
00:20:44,276 --> 00:20:46,210
Yeah.

226
00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:51,510
You know, I never thought
it made sense, though...

227
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:54,575
you know, the way
they got together so quick.

228
00:20:54,653 --> 00:20:56,587
Why not?

229
00:20:56,655 --> 00:20:58,919
- I mean, romantically.
- Mm-hmm.

230
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:05,623
Well, but it... if... uh.
All right.

231
00:21:05,697 --> 00:21:08,757
Here we go. All right.
Where the hell are we?

232
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:10,825
At the turnpike. Glenn's right above us
with the other car.

233
00:21:10,902 --> 00:21:13,894
- All right, c'mon. Hop on out.
- Turn around and get your hands up!

234
00:21:13,972 --> 00:21:16,031
Shit!

235
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,338
We may as well leave her.
We're leavin' the car...

236
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:20,173
and we gotta leave her someplace,
anyway... what's the difference where?

237
00:21:20,245 --> 00:21:23,146
- She's comin' with us.
- Jesus Christ, what were
you doing in there?

238
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:26,082
- Look for a name.
- I already looked.

239
00:21:26,151 --> 00:21:29,450
Her name is Karen Sisco. Like
the Cisco Kid, only spelled different.

240
00:21:29,521 --> 00:21:31,648
S-l-S-C-O.

241
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:38,229
Karen?

242
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:41,528
All right, Karen?
You be a good girl, now.

243
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,625
I'm gonna open up the trunk.

244
00:21:43,702 --> 00:21:47,968
Hey, hey, hey, now!
Now, you're puttin' holes in your car!

245
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:53,876
I'm not leavin' you.
I'm gonna open the trunk enough
for you to drop your pistol out.

246
00:21:53,945 --> 00:21:57,574
Now, if you shoot, Buddy's got
your shotgun, he's gonna shoot back.

247
00:21:57,649 --> 00:22:00,516
There's nothin' I can do about it,
so it's up to you.

248
00:22:00,585 --> 00:22:05,522
Hey. Don't!
It's Glenn! Whoa!

249
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:09,048
Fuck! Hey, hey, Jack.
Good to see you, man.

250
00:22:09,127 --> 00:22:12,494
What the fuck
are you guys shooting at?

251
00:22:12,564 --> 00:22:14,759
- Do we need 'im?
- The cop saw this car.

252
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:17,802
- He might tie it to the break
and turn around.
- All right.

253
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:22,397
- Hey, Studs. We didn't recognize ya.
- Hey, "Studs," man.

254
00:22:22,474 --> 00:22:27,571
I haven't heard that since Lompoc, man.
So what's goin' on?

255
00:22:28,914 --> 00:22:30,848
Aw, nothin'.

256
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:35,910
Karen. Are you comin' out?

257
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:41,921
- You hear that?
- Okay!

258
00:22:43,228 --> 00:22:45,162
Okay.

259
00:22:53,405 --> 00:22:55,339
You win, Jack.

260
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:08,778
Now, you get your clothes cleaned,
you send me the bill.

261
00:23:08,854 --> 00:23:10,822
I'll send it to you at Glades.

262
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:14,222
What, did you crawl through
a sewer, man? Who're you?

263
00:23:14,292 --> 00:23:17,693
- Take your sunglasses off.
- I see better with 'em on, man.

264
00:23:17,763 --> 00:23:20,027
You don't take 'em off
I'm gonna throw them off
while they're still on your head.

265
00:23:20,098 --> 00:23:25,229
- Go wait in the car.
- Um, we're in civilization now,
so you can ease up a little bit.

266
00:23:25,303 --> 00:23:29,535
I'm sorry. I'd like you
to wait in the car, please.
Take her, put her in the back.

267
00:23:29,608 --> 00:23:33,544
- Okay. In the trunk?
- In the backseat! In the backseat!

268
00:23:33,612 --> 00:23:36,979
- Backseat. Okay, you gotta come now,
'cause I gotta do this...
- Gimme your jacket.

269
00:23:37,048 --> 00:23:39,414
Somebody forgot
to bring the clean clothes.

270
00:23:39,484 --> 00:23:41,543
I brought 'em. They're at Glades
in the back of the Cadillac.

271
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,952
You decided to jump
into the trunk of her car.

272
00:23:44,022 --> 00:23:46,547
You can blame me if you want.
I don't mind.

273
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:50,254
- Here, sir.
- I'll tell you...

274
00:23:50,328 --> 00:23:52,888
- What's your problem, Jack?
- I don't know why you got Glenn
involved in this.

275
00:23:52,964 --> 00:23:55,296
- How 'bout the score was
his idea to begin with?
- Idea...

276
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:57,426
The guy's got a fuckin'
vacant lot for a head.

277
00:23:57,502 --> 00:24:01,438
He thinks he can talk
to me like that? Shit.

278
00:24:01,506 --> 00:24:06,443
"Gimme your jacket." I have been
sitting here for over a half-hour...

279
00:24:06,511 --> 00:24:10,311
watchin' out for the Highway Patrol,
if you think that's fun.

280
00:24:10,382 --> 00:24:13,840
God. You know, I hadda go
over there in the bushes...

281
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:18,253
to smoke a joint, just so I could like,
you know?

282
00:24:18,323 --> 00:24:23,124
Yep. I got somethin'
big lined up, up north.

283
00:24:23,195 --> 00:24:27,529
Yeah, these guys? Wouldn't even fuckin'
know about it if it wasn't for me.

284
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:31,057
- Every time he opens his mouth,
I wanna punch him out.
- He's not the problem, Jack.

285
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:34,105
You wanna pull your head
outta your ass, tell me why the hell
we're bringing her with us?

286
00:24:34,172 --> 00:24:36,402
Glenn.

287
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:38,773
You don't remember me, do you?

288
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:45,512
Um, couldn't have been Glades
if that's what you're thinkin',
'cause I was never out there.

289
00:24:45,584 --> 00:24:49,384
- No, that's not what I'm thinking.
- Oh, yeah?

290
00:24:49,454 --> 00:24:52,946
But you're sure
we've met, huh?

291
00:24:53,024 --> 00:24:54,719
Last fall.

292
00:24:54,793 --> 00:24:59,856
I drove you from the Palm Beach County
Jail to the federal courthouse... twice.

293
00:24:59,931 --> 00:25:02,263
You're Glenn Michaels.

294
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:05,064
I never forget anybody
I've cuffed and shackled.

295
00:25:05,136 --> 00:25:07,832
Now let's think about this for a minute,
Glenn, see if we can't work it out.

296
00:25:07,906 --> 00:25:11,569
Do we have a gun in the car?

297
00:25:11,643 --> 00:25:14,476
Oh, shit!
I remember you! Hey!

298
00:25:14,546 --> 00:25:17,845
Foley's not gonna make it,
and if he goes down, you go with him.

299
00:25:17,916 --> 00:25:20,749
- Now, look. I can understand
if you guys are close, but...
- No, we're not.

300
00:25:20,819 --> 00:25:26,052
- But, yeah. I'm helpin' him.
- Now wait a minute, Glenn.

301
00:25:26,124 --> 00:25:28,058
Have you helped him?

302
00:25:28,126 --> 00:25:32,290
I mean, technically,
at this point, I doubt you could be
charged with aiding a fugitive.

303
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:34,332
So you still have a choice.

304
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:38,392
You wanna take her to my place, get
cleaned up, come out of the bathroom...

305
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:41,564
with your aftershave on, and she goes,
"Oh. I had you all wrong."

306
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,574
No. I just wanna talk
to her again, that's all.

307
00:25:43,642 --> 00:25:47,442
I just wanna see what it might have
been like under normal circumstances.

308
00:25:47,512 --> 00:25:49,946
It's too late for that, Jack.

309
00:25:50,015 --> 00:25:52,381
He wants to get out of here,
and I don't blame him.

310
00:26:31,189 --> 00:26:35,148
Ref don't call it soon, Snoop's gonna
send this cat out in a body bag.

311
00:26:36,628 --> 00:26:39,324
Anybody ever tell you
why they call him "Snoopy"?

312
00:26:41,533 --> 00:26:44,093
He used to be
Maurice "Mad Dog" Miller...

313
00:26:44,169 --> 00:26:46,637
back when he was a pro.

314
00:26:48,306 --> 00:26:50,274
Now you pet him,
he goes down.

315
00:26:56,514 --> 00:26:59,483
- I don't believe it!
- Oh, my!

316
00:27:03,989 --> 00:27:06,787
Bullshit! Bullshit!

317
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:12,289
Yeah, you the man.

318
00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:19,633
Guy's bragging he won
a thrown fight.

319
00:27:19,704 --> 00:27:21,638
Fuckin' pathetic.

320
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:27,411
Dangerous is what it is.

321
00:27:31,082 --> 00:27:34,518
- Who's the bald dude?
- Richard Ripley.

322
00:27:34,586 --> 00:27:37,020
The Wall Street guy?

323
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:39,818
Call him Dick The Ripper on account
of all the guys he ripped off.

324
00:27:39,891 --> 00:27:43,122
Oh, yeah. I didn't
recognize him without his rug.

325
00:27:43,194 --> 00:27:45,219
- What's his bid?
- Three years.

326
00:27:45,296 --> 00:27:48,356
You guys on the bench? Okay.

327
00:27:48,433 --> 00:27:52,494
Three years, fined $50 million
and wrote 'em a fuckin' check.

328
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:54,538
Just like that.

329
00:27:54,606 --> 00:27:57,268
Fifty mill, signed his name.

330
00:27:57,342 --> 00:28:00,436
Didn't even... Didn't even...
Okay, a little help.

331
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:02,343
Okay, heavy!

332
00:28:02,414 --> 00:28:04,348
Heavy! Come on!

333
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:11,921
All the bright glare out here,
you couldn't read the numbers
on the weights.

334
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:14,857
Oh. I had it. Jesus.

335
00:28:14,926 --> 00:28:18,692
- How do you know he wrote a check?
- Uh, he told me.

336
00:28:18,763 --> 00:28:21,357
We work laundry together.

337
00:28:21,433 --> 00:28:23,697
Guy loves to fucking talk.

338
00:28:23,768 --> 00:28:26,965
Yeah, he loves to talk.
He talked to the U.S. Attorney.

339
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:29,563
Rolled over on all the snitches
he was doing business with.

340
00:28:29,641 --> 00:28:34,044
Hey! Any guy who can write
a fuckin' check for $50 million...

341
00:28:34,112 --> 00:28:37,707
he says anything,
I'm all fuckin' ears.

342
00:28:37,782 --> 00:28:41,718
Guy tells me he's got
all this money in foreign banks.

343
00:28:41,786 --> 00:28:44,186
Plus, around, mmm...

344
00:28:44,255 --> 00:28:48,123
five million in uncut diamonds
at his house.

345
00:28:48,193 --> 00:28:50,127
He said, quote...

346
00:28:50,195 --> 00:28:53,062
that I can get my hands on it
at any time.

347
00:28:53,131 --> 00:28:55,361
- Where does he live?
- Detroit.

348
00:28:55,433 --> 00:29:00,598
Snoopy Miller says that uncut diamonds
are as easy to move as cash.

349
00:29:03,108 --> 00:29:05,440
Ever seen
an uncut diamond, Studs?

350
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:08,308
Looks just like
a plain, old rock.

351
00:29:08,379 --> 00:29:12,440
Wait, you think this guy's lying?

352
00:29:14,786 --> 00:29:18,153
What do you think, Studs? Use
your head. Some guy's got $5 million...

353
00:29:18,223 --> 00:29:22,853
socked away in his house,
and he's gonna tell some motormouth
he just met in prison about it.

354
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:26,787
Oh, I see.
You guys are cynical. Right.

355
00:29:37,742 --> 00:29:39,676
Here it comes.

356
00:29:53,324 --> 00:29:56,122
Keep on walking. Keep walking.

357
00:29:56,194 --> 00:29:58,594
You don't wanna be
answering any questions.

358
00:30:06,204 --> 00:30:08,502
I'm just saying
she wasn't scared, that's all.

359
00:30:08,573 --> 00:30:11,838
That's 'cause she had
her hand on her gun the whole time
waitin' to make her move.

360
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:14,743
You're just jealous 'cause
it was me in the trunk with her...

361
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:16,747
- and not you.
- You're right.

362
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:20,615
The first thing I'm gonna do...
is get this mud off me.

363
00:31:54,445 --> 00:31:56,470
Hey.

364
00:32:25,343 --> 00:32:27,436
Karen?

365
00:32:27,512 --> 00:32:29,844
Karen, honey?

366
00:32:29,914 --> 00:32:33,213
Karen?

367
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:35,616
You were talking
in your sleep.

368
00:32:40,491 --> 00:32:42,652
What'd I say?

369
00:32:42,727 --> 00:32:44,661
"Hey, yourself."

370
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:49,623
Huh.

371
00:32:49,701 --> 00:32:52,226
Hello, Daniel.

372
00:32:57,542 --> 00:33:01,979
Daniel Burdon, F.B.I.

373
00:33:02,046 --> 00:33:04,446
Marshall Sisco, Karen's dad.

374
00:33:04,515 --> 00:33:06,449
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

375
00:33:06,517 --> 00:33:08,451
Umm...

376
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:11,647
Would you mind, please,
waiting outside?

377
00:33:11,723 --> 00:33:13,816
We have some business
to do here.

378
00:33:16,127 --> 00:33:18,493
Well, uh, I have
to use the john anyway.

379
00:33:18,563 --> 00:33:20,497
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

380
00:33:25,403 --> 00:33:28,531
I wanna be
on the task force, Daniel.

381
00:33:28,606 --> 00:33:30,904
Well...

382
00:33:30,975 --> 00:33:35,469
That's nice of you
to offer, Karen, but...

383
00:33:35,546 --> 00:33:39,607
I got all the help
I can use right now.

384
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:44,144
Instead, let's talk about
how you got that bump on your head.

385
00:33:44,222 --> 00:33:46,690
Isn't that my file
you're holding on to?

386
00:33:46,758 --> 00:33:49,955
Yes, but I want
to hear it from you...

387
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:53,555
starting... with when
you grabbed the wheel.

388
00:33:53,631 --> 00:33:56,464
Where was this?

389
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:58,468
Coming to the Okeechobee exit.

390
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:01,699
- Sit back!
- Can you see with those glasses on?

391
00:34:01,773 --> 00:34:04,537
I'm fine!
This is... stupid, man.

392
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:07,043
These guys are gonna be
so disappointed in me, man.

393
00:34:07,111 --> 00:34:09,443
You know what?
If I wasn't stoned...

394
00:34:09,514 --> 00:34:12,483
there is no way that you would have
talked me into this.

395
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:15,383
- Remember that.
- Get off at the exit
right after that bridge.

396
00:34:15,453 --> 00:34:19,014
No, I am not fucking turning
myself in, so forget it!

397
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:21,183
- Get off at that exit!
- What exit?

398
00:34:21,259 --> 00:34:23,659
- That exit right there. Take that exit!
- Sit back! No!

399
00:34:31,436 --> 00:34:33,529
The next thing I knew...

400
00:34:33,604 --> 00:34:37,005
the paramedics were
pulling me out of the car.

401
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:39,908
- You all right?
- There's a couple
of points I keep wondering about...

402
00:34:39,977 --> 00:34:42,138
have to do with the two guys
that grabbed you.

403
00:34:42,213 --> 00:34:46,274
Buddy, is it?
And this fella Jack Foley.

404
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:50,013
I swear, the man must have robbed
over 200 banks in his time.

405
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:52,022
- Really?
- Um-hmm.

406
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:54,354
He told me he didn't
remember how many he robbed.

407
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:56,950
Then you talked to him.

408
00:34:57,028 --> 00:34:59,394
In the trunk, yeah.

409
00:34:59,464 --> 00:35:01,989
What'd you talk about?

410
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,091
Different things.

411
00:35:04,168 --> 00:35:07,035
Prison, movies.

412
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:11,769
This fella holds you hostage,
you talk about movies?

413
00:35:14,078 --> 00:35:16,911
It was an unusual experience.

414
00:35:16,981 --> 00:35:19,950
You know, Foley made me think
of that fella Carl Tillman.

415
00:35:20,017 --> 00:35:23,612
The one that you were seeing,
it turns out, the same time
he was robbing banks.

416
00:35:23,688 --> 00:35:26,122
- Do you recall that?
- And what happened to Carl?

417
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:30,126
The time came, you shot him. But you
didn't shoot Foley or the guy with him.

418
00:35:30,194 --> 00:35:34,756
They're unarmed, you had a shotgun
and you let them throw you in the trunk.

419
00:35:34,832 --> 00:35:37,232
Okay. Now you got
your Sig in your hand...

420
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:39,701
and you say in the report
that you couldn't turn around.

421
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:43,069
He had you pinned down.
But when the trunk opened...

422
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:45,837
how come you didn't
cap the two guys then?

423
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:49,277
What do you work on most of the time?
Fraud? Go after crooked bookkeepers?

424
00:35:49,347 --> 00:35:53,909
Karen, I've been with the bureau
15 years on all kinds of investigations.

425
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:56,920
- Have you ever shot a man?
- No.

426
00:35:56,988 --> 00:36:00,446
- When was the last time you were
primary through the door?
- I have to qualify?

427
00:36:00,525 --> 00:36:02,516
You have to know
what you're talking about.

428
00:36:07,365 --> 00:36:10,027
We'll talk another time.
All right, Karen?

429
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:16,533
I'd like to know why Foley
put you in that second car
when he didn't need you anymore.

430
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,569
You'll have to ask him that.

431
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:39,019
Rip, Rip.

432
00:36:39,096 --> 00:36:42,088
- What the deal is, baby?
- Hi, Maurice.

433
00:36:42,166 --> 00:36:44,634
- Oops. I don't know.
- Make a fist...

434
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:47,193
- There you go.
- Fuck it, man.

435
00:36:47,271 --> 00:36:49,466
- Got your little fishies for you.
- Oh, good.

436
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:54,739
Not so fast. Starting out,
there's gonna be an across the board
cost of living increase.

437
00:36:54,812 --> 00:36:58,339
- What?
- When I got put in here a year ago
on credit card fraud...

438
00:36:58,416 --> 00:37:00,350
I didn't really get
no props for that.

439
00:37:00,418 --> 00:37:04,184
But ever since I shanked
that loudmouth pussy in the yard...

440
00:37:04,255 --> 00:37:08,749
it's like my Dun and Broadstreet around
this bitch done shot way the fuck up.

441
00:37:08,826 --> 00:37:12,785
Actually, it's Dun and Bradstreet.
That's the, uh...

442
00:37:12,863 --> 00:37:15,161
Well, I've heard it both ways.

443
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:17,827
Point is that the price
has gone up around this bitch too.

444
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:20,871
Get your little black book out.
We got some business to talk about.

445
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:26,171
For the little fishies...
What'd I say they was gonna be?

446
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:29,372
- Two thousand.
- Now they're gonna be three thousand.

447
00:37:29,447 --> 00:37:32,439
- Come on. You...
- Now they're gonna be three thousand.

448
00:37:34,518 --> 00:37:36,918
That saltwater shit
you put in your eyes?

449
00:37:36,988 --> 00:37:39,821
- What do you call that?
- Bausch & Lomb.

450
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:42,984
Yeah, that bushy lawn shit.
That's 300.

451
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:46,359
- I need it.
- Yeah, you do. And that extra pillow.

452
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:49,627
I'm gonna get that for you,
but that's gonna be like five C's.

453
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:51,634
- Five?
- Hey.

454
00:37:51,702 --> 00:37:55,138
Sign says shut the fuck up,
or can't you fellas read?

455
00:37:55,206 --> 00:37:57,367
Who the fuck
you talkin' to, man?

456
00:37:58,676 --> 00:38:00,974
You got a problem
over there, Foley?

457
00:38:01,045 --> 00:38:06,176
Yeah, this is
the dumbest fucking shakedown
in the history of dumb shakedowns.

458
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:08,548
- Five hundred bucks for a pillow?
- That's right.

459
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:11,747
- It does seem a little high,
doesn't it?
- Shut up, Dick.

460
00:38:11,822 --> 00:38:13,949
- Must be a nice pillow.
- Full goose down.

461
00:38:14,025 --> 00:38:16,960
- Look, you still...
- How much for your company at chow?

462
00:38:17,028 --> 00:38:20,327
My company? Come on, man. You know
I'll watch this motherfucker's back.

463
00:38:20,398 --> 00:38:23,060
- How much?
- That's a C-note.

464
00:38:25,403 --> 00:38:28,133
If you're smart, Ripley,
you'll tell this guy to fuck off.

465
00:38:28,205 --> 00:38:30,139
Really?

466
00:38:30,207 --> 00:38:32,835
Well, l... l...
I don't know.

467
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:36,243
First of all, if he kills you,
then he's gonna get nothin'.

468
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:39,647
Well, uh, the man don't
just have to die, Foley.

469
00:38:39,717 --> 00:38:43,744
He could accidentally hurt himself
falling down on something real hard.

470
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:47,689
Like a shiv or my dick.

471
00:38:47,758 --> 00:38:50,420
I'll pay. I'll pay it.
Don't worry.

472
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:52,860
If he falls on anything, Snoop...

473
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:56,696
then they're gonna transfer
his ass outta here faster
than you can throw a fight...

474
00:38:56,767 --> 00:38:58,997
and you're still
gonna get nothin'.

475
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:01,630
You know, last time I checked, man...

476
00:39:01,706 --> 00:39:04,140
this shit over here ain't
got nothin' to do with you.

477
00:39:04,208 --> 00:39:06,972
Why don't you go outside?
Smoke a cigarette or some shit.

478
00:39:07,044 --> 00:39:09,308
I don't smoke.

479
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:12,144
You heard the man. Why don't
you get your punk ass up outta here?

480
00:39:12,216 --> 00:39:15,811
- Uh-oh.
- You fucked up now, man. That's Himey.

481
00:39:15,886 --> 00:39:19,378
Protege of mine. Ranked number 32
in the federal prison system.

482
00:39:19,457 --> 00:39:21,391
- Thirty-two?
- That's right.

483
00:39:21,459 --> 00:39:24,019
- Out of, what, 20.
- Kick this cracker's ass.

484
00:39:31,769 --> 00:39:33,964
- What's going on here?
- Uh, nothin'.

485
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:37,667
Just "reading is fundamental" shit.
We got all excited and everything.

486
00:39:37,742 --> 00:39:39,710
Clear outta here. Now.

487
00:39:39,777 --> 00:39:42,143
- No problem.
- All of you. Let's go.

488
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:49,152
Uh, Snoopy.
I think we settled the fish thing.

489
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,154
Oh, the fish. Yeah.

490
00:40:02,166 --> 00:40:04,600
That's how you
do the shake, partner.

491
00:40:10,341 --> 00:40:13,572
Paper says there's ten grand each
on you, Chino and Lulu.

492
00:40:13,644 --> 00:40:15,578
They say anything about Karen?

493
00:40:15,646 --> 00:40:17,580
Just that she got away. Here.

494
00:40:17,648 --> 00:40:19,673
- Hmm?
- Jack!

495
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,684
- Hey!
- That's all right. It's in the pool.

496
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:24,812
Did it say what happened to her
after she took off with Glenn?

497
00:40:24,889 --> 00:40:26,823
I don't know.
You'll have to ask Glenn.

498
00:40:26,891 --> 00:40:29,553
He's probably on his way to Detroit,
which is where we should be.

499
00:40:29,627 --> 00:40:32,619
- Yeah.
- Do you realize what you're doing?

500
00:40:32,696 --> 00:40:35,096
Worrying about a woman
who works for law enforcement?

501
00:40:35,166 --> 00:40:38,727
You wanna sit down and have cocktails
with a woman who tried to shoot you.

502
00:40:38,803 --> 00:40:42,034
- Do you hear what I'm saying?
- Do you think this old guy's
her boyfriend?

503
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:44,040
It's the only picture
she has in here.

504
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:46,542
Am I going to Detroit by myself?

505
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:48,805
The longer we stay here,
the better chance there is...

506
00:40:48,879 --> 00:40:50,813
that either Glenn
is gonna screw up the score...

507
00:40:50,881 --> 00:40:53,975
or we gonna get busted or both.

508
00:40:58,322 --> 00:41:00,256
This is Foley?

509
00:41:00,324 --> 00:41:02,724
- Karen?
- Hmm?

510
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:06,923
This is Foley?

511
00:41:06,997 --> 00:41:10,091
Doesn't even look like that.

512
00:41:10,167 --> 00:41:14,001
- Oh, no?
- Uh-uh. He looks a lot like...

513
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,374
Different.

514
00:41:23,747 --> 00:41:26,147
Wyatt Earp is here.

515
00:41:32,923 --> 00:41:34,857
- Hey.
- Hey.

516
00:41:34,925 --> 00:41:37,359
- How you feelin'? Feel better?
- Good. Yeah.

517
00:41:37,428 --> 00:41:40,397
- Is your dad taking good care of you?
- He took the week off...

518
00:41:40,464 --> 00:41:44,025
to take care of me and he's worked on
his boat every day since.

519
00:41:44,101 --> 00:41:46,399
- Dad, this is Ray Nicolet.
- Hi.

520
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:49,837
- Pleasure to meet you.
I heard a lot about you.
- Likewise.

521
00:41:49,907 --> 00:41:53,308
Ray's working with the F.B.I.
Task force on the prison break.

522
00:41:53,377 --> 00:41:57,245
I see that. Tell me, Ray, do you ever
wear one that says "undercover"?

523
00:41:59,917 --> 00:42:02,520
- No.
- How's it going?

524
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,454
Sit down.

525
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:08,049
Okay. Good.
We caught one of them.

526
00:42:08,125 --> 00:42:10,116
- Was it Foley?
- Was it off a tip?

527
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:13,686
Somebody spotted two of them
out in this hobo camp near the airport.

528
00:42:13,764 --> 00:42:15,891
Called in the number.
That was it.

529
00:42:15,966 --> 00:42:18,901
- I knew it as soon
as I as there was a reward.
- Was it Foley?

530
00:42:18,969 --> 00:42:21,961
No, Linares,
one of the Cubans.

531
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:25,497
We went in there with full SWAT,
two choppers, that whole deal.

532
00:42:25,576 --> 00:42:28,010
Linares goes nuts,
starts shooting, so we took him out.

533
00:42:28,078 --> 00:42:31,013
I don't know how Chirino
got away, but he did.

534
00:42:31,081 --> 00:42:34,073
- And Foley hadn't been there.
- No, this place was strictly Cuban.

535
00:42:34,151 --> 00:42:38,349
Foley had a ride. He must have
his own agenda. You know what I mean?

536
00:42:38,422 --> 00:42:41,755
He seems to be the only guy
who kinda knows what he's doing.

537
00:42:41,825 --> 00:42:43,759
Uh-huh.

538
00:42:43,827 --> 00:42:46,455
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

539
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:48,521
Hello?

540
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:51,261
Yeah, she is.
Just a minute, please.

541
00:42:51,335 --> 00:42:53,269
Karen.

542
00:42:53,337 --> 00:42:56,135
- Hello?
- Hi.

543
00:42:57,575 --> 00:43:01,136
You know who this is?

544
00:43:01,211 --> 00:43:04,476
Yes.
Five minutes.

545
00:43:11,188 --> 00:43:13,122
So. Ray.

546
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:15,886
- Yeah.
- There's something I'm wondering.

547
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:19,896
The headline reads, "I slept with
a murderer, says shaken Miami woman."

548
00:43:19,964 --> 00:43:23,058
- Who is it that answered the phone?
- None of your business.

549
00:43:23,133 --> 00:43:26,034
I'm just worried maybe
I'm not old enough for you.

550
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:29,561
- It was my dad.
- Really?

551
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:33,633
- He's got a cop's face.
- How do you know?

552
00:43:33,711 --> 00:43:37,477
- Oh, wait. You have my wallet.
- And your gun.

553
00:43:37,548 --> 00:43:39,914
- Think I can have 'em back?
- How do we do that?

554
00:43:39,984 --> 00:43:42,919
You can come by my dad's place
and drop 'em off.

555
00:43:42,987 --> 00:43:45,820
I could leave it with the SWAT guy
that answers the door.

556
00:43:45,889 --> 00:43:48,619
There's a guy here
on the task force right now.

557
00:43:48,692 --> 00:43:51,217
Maybe I should put him on the phone
and let the two of you work it out.

558
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:53,490
- You wouldn't do that.
- Why not?

559
00:43:53,564 --> 00:43:57,159
Because you're having
too much fun.

560
00:43:57,234 --> 00:43:59,168
She fixes him pork chops and rice.

561
00:43:59,236 --> 00:44:02,000
The next thing you know,
they're making love on the sofa.

562
00:44:02,072 --> 00:44:04,063
She says he was very gentle.

563
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:07,907
This guy, Chirino, shows up at the
house, says he misses his little girl.

564
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:11,607
She feels sorry for him.
Next thing you know... boom.

565
00:44:11,682 --> 00:44:14,708
- On the couch.
- That's how you score now, huh?

566
00:44:16,253 --> 00:44:18,187
I guess.

567
00:44:18,255 --> 00:44:20,314
There's something
I've been wondering.

568
00:44:20,391 --> 00:44:22,484
Whatever happened
to your Uncle Cully?

569
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:24,925
You think he's gonna
tell you where I am?

570
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:27,828
- Unless you wanna tell me.
- He's dead.

571
00:44:27,898 --> 00:44:29,832
Did 27 years before he got out...

572
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:32,994
and he died a couple of years afterwards
in a charity hospital...

573
00:44:33,070 --> 00:44:35,868
by trying to make up
for all the good times he missed.

574
00:44:35,939 --> 00:44:38,032
That's not gonna be me.

575
00:44:38,108 --> 00:44:42,044
What, one last score, retire
to some island? Is that the idea?

576
00:44:42,112 --> 00:44:44,740
- Jack.
- I'm partial to mountains myself...

577
00:44:44,815 --> 00:44:47,443
but if you like islands,
we'll make it an island.

578
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:51,682
- What do you mean,
"we'll make it an island"?
- You and I can make it...

579
00:44:51,755 --> 00:44:54,223
- Jack, you better come
and check this out.
- Is that Buddy?

580
00:44:54,291 --> 00:44:56,987
- What? No. Okay. Bye-bye.
- Who're you talking to?

581
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:00,796
- So she's a married woman.
- Right.

582
00:45:00,864 --> 00:45:03,389
But she goes to bed
with a prison escapee because...

583
00:45:03,467 --> 00:45:06,027
he tells her that
he misses his little girl.

584
00:45:06,103 --> 00:45:09,095
She tells the world about it.
But you protect her.

585
00:45:09,173 --> 00:45:12,006
You don't reveal her name.

586
00:45:12,076 --> 00:45:14,772
That makes it sound like
what she was doing was okay...

587
00:45:14,845 --> 00:45:16,972
as long as her husband
doesn't find out.

588
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:21,711
Like the guy who cheats
on his wife, saying what
she doesn't know won't bother her.

589
00:45:21,785 --> 00:45:23,719
- Dad.
- What?

590
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:34,022
Ray, I wanna show you
something... in the living room.

591
00:45:35,299 --> 00:45:37,767
- Yeah.
- Good talking to you, Ray.

592
00:45:37,835 --> 00:45:39,769
Yeah, you too.

593
00:45:43,774 --> 00:45:46,208
Federal law enforcement
agents raided a squatters camp...

594
00:45:46,276 --> 00:45:48,938
north of Miami International
Airport this morning...

595
00:45:49,012 --> 00:45:54,279
in the hopes of capturing
a fugitive from Tuesday's daring escape
from Glades prison.

596
00:45:54,351 --> 00:45:58,185
F.B.I. Officials confirm that
one of the escapees, Arelio Linares...

597
00:45:58,255 --> 00:46:00,883
- was killed...
- Chino's gonna
wanna talk to me.

598
00:46:00,958 --> 00:46:04,223
Chino's runnin' for his life.
He don't give a shit about you.

599
00:46:04,294 --> 00:46:08,128
He's gonna know by now
I gave him up back at Glades.
He's gonna wanna find me.

600
00:46:08,198 --> 00:46:11,065
Maybe see Adele,
see what she knows.

601
00:46:11,135 --> 00:46:13,865
He knows where she lives?

602
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:16,599
Jack!

603
00:46:16,673 --> 00:46:18,664
We were talking once,
drinking rum...

604
00:46:18,742 --> 00:46:21,768
and I may have
mentioned Adele.

605
00:46:21,845 --> 00:46:24,336
How she worked for a magician.
Chino got all interested.

606
00:46:24,414 --> 00:46:27,042
He said, "How do you saw
the woman in half?"

607
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:30,382
Maybe he wanted to meet her,
maybe see her if she came to visit.

608
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:33,912
Oh, okay, okay. So you call her up
and tell her don't talk to any Cubans.

609
00:46:33,991 --> 00:46:37,188
- The phone's probably tapped by now.
- You're right.

610
00:46:37,261 --> 00:46:39,695
And if the phone is tapped,
you know they have her place staked out.

611
00:46:39,763 --> 00:46:43,961
Shit!

612
00:46:44,034 --> 00:46:45,968
Adele Delisi speaking.

613
00:46:46,036 --> 00:46:49,267
- Uh, uh, this is Adele?
- Yes, it is.

614
00:46:49,339 --> 00:46:51,273
Oh... Uh, sorry.
Wrong number.

615
00:47:07,858 --> 00:47:10,088
Nice disguise.

616
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,094
I'm a tourist.

617
00:47:13,931 --> 00:47:16,695
All right. Here we go.

618
00:47:16,767 --> 00:47:20,931
Coming up right here...
on the left.

619
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:24,201
- What about the guy with the clippers?
- I wonder what the F.B. I...

620
00:47:24,274 --> 00:47:26,902
is charging to trim hedges
these days?

621
00:47:26,977 --> 00:47:31,209
- Quite a checker game
they got goin' on too.
- Pull on up.

622
00:47:54,671 --> 00:47:56,901
Oh, man.

623
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:05,678
Oh, man.

624
00:48:05,749 --> 00:48:07,808
Okay, you saw her.
That's all you get.

625
00:48:13,857 --> 00:48:17,486
- Let's go to Detroit.
- Now you're talkin', brother.

626
00:48:19,329 --> 00:48:22,162
I'll say one thing for Jack...
he's very considerate.

627
00:48:22,232 --> 00:48:24,257
Lights on or off,
if you know what I mean.

628
00:48:24,334 --> 00:48:26,165
- Really.
- Hmm.

629
00:48:29,273 --> 00:48:31,707
Adele, listen...

630
00:48:31,775 --> 00:48:36,508
I just want to find him
before he does something else
and makes it worse on himself.

631
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:40,482
No. Buddy'll take care of him.

632
00:48:40,550 --> 00:48:44,213
Keep him out of trouble.
He's Jack's conscience, always has been.

633
00:48:44,288 --> 00:48:48,019
They must have robbed
50 banks together.

634
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:51,891
- They were a really great team.
- Until they got busted.

635
00:48:51,962 --> 00:48:54,829
Hmm. That wasn't Jack's fault,
no, that was on account of...

636
00:48:54,898 --> 00:48:59,528
Buddy, for some reason, decided to call
his sister and confess to the job...

637
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:01,935
before they'd done it
instead of after.

638
00:49:02,005 --> 00:49:06,635
Well, she called the F.B.I. They both
went down, and they ended up at Lompoc.

639
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:09,736
I think Buddy felt
kind of bad about that.

640
00:49:11,081 --> 00:49:14,073
Adele, do you have any idea
where I could find Buddy?

641
00:49:14,151 --> 00:49:18,247
Or Glenn?

642
00:49:18,322 --> 00:49:20,847
Mira, Adele, you in there?

643
00:49:20,924 --> 00:49:24,087
- Yes.
- Mira, I'd like to speak to you, please.

644
00:49:24,161 --> 00:49:27,460
- Well, who is it?
- Emile, you know, the guy
you used to work for?

645
00:49:27,531 --> 00:49:30,591
- Uh...
- He gave me your number
and where you live.

646
00:49:30,667 --> 00:49:34,194
Mira, I'm looking for an assistant.
Can I speak to you, please?

647
00:49:34,271 --> 00:49:37,104
- Oh. Uh, yeah.
- All right.

648
00:49:37,174 --> 00:49:39,142
You did work for Emile, right?

649
00:49:39,209 --> 00:49:42,372
Uh, yeah, I was Emile's box jumper
for four years, almost.

650
00:49:42,446 --> 00:49:44,380
Cono! You were what, his box?

651
00:49:44,448 --> 00:49:46,439
- Uh, his assistant.
- Oh, okay.

652
00:49:48,552 --> 00:49:50,952
You say you perform
in the Miami area?

653
00:49:51,021 --> 00:49:53,888
Oh, si. Here, there, you know.

654
00:49:53,957 --> 00:49:57,552
I was a magician in Cuba. They used
to call me Manuelito the Magician.

655
00:49:57,627 --> 00:49:59,720
Mira, can you please open?

656
00:49:59,796 --> 00:50:03,596
- I'm not dressed.
- I'm a good friend of Jack Foley.

657
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:07,194
- You know Jack?
- Who are you?

658
00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:09,363
Jose Chirino.

659
00:50:09,439 --> 00:50:13,535
Or maybe you heard Jack call me Chino.
Bueno, I'm the same guy.

660
00:50:13,610 --> 00:50:16,704
Tell him he has to wait in the hall.
You have to get dressed. Say it loud.

661
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:19,010
Wait in the hall.
You have to get dressed.

662
00:50:19,082 --> 00:50:22,540
Mira, mira, you tell me
where I could find Jack
and I don't bother you no more.

663
00:50:22,619 --> 00:50:25,213
Now, come on, please! Hello?

664
00:50:25,288 --> 00:50:28,815
- I don't know where he is.
- I'm the guy that helped
Jack escape from prison.

665
00:50:28,892 --> 00:50:32,487
- Mira, please open this fucking door...
- I'm gonna call the police.

666
00:50:32,562 --> 00:50:37,625
Cono, why you gonna do that
to a friend, man? A partner to Jack?

667
00:50:39,002 --> 00:50:41,800
That's it! That's it!

668
00:50:48,812 --> 00:50:52,441
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!
Cono, mira, please!

669
00:50:52,516 --> 00:50:54,450
- Adele! Adele!
- Give me your hand.

670
00:50:54,518 --> 00:50:57,419
- You not Adele!
- I'm a federal marshal,
and you're under arrest.

671
00:50:57,487 --> 00:51:00,456
- Get my bag, Adele.
- Oh.

672
00:51:00,524 --> 00:51:02,549
Mira, please, please. I think
there's a misunderstanding here.

673
00:51:02,626 --> 00:51:04,594
Can you...
you got nice bag.

674
00:51:04,661 --> 00:51:08,427
Mira, let's say we just forget about it,
okay? We forget about this, I go home...

675
00:51:08,498 --> 00:51:11,524
- Shut up.
- Owwww! Who the hell
taught you how to do that?

676
00:51:11,601 --> 00:51:13,694
- Give me your other hand.
- Okay, okay. Ay, cono.

677
00:51:13,770 --> 00:51:16,534
Ohhhh!
I gotta go make pee-pee.

678
00:51:16,606 --> 00:51:19,370
Ohhhhh! Owww!

679
00:51:19,443 --> 00:51:21,911
Wow! You are mean!

680
00:51:21,978 --> 00:51:26,381
Look, I'm gonna call my lawyer.
This is... What do they call that?
Human rights violation.

681
00:51:26,450 --> 00:51:29,613
- Ay, cono.
- Daniel Burdon, please. Karen Sisco.

682
00:51:29,686 --> 00:51:32,450
Mira, Adele, Adele.
Can I ask you a question, please?

683
00:51:32,522 --> 00:51:34,956
You know that trick you do?

684
00:51:35,025 --> 00:51:38,483
Karen? Where are you?
I've been trying to reach you.

685
00:51:38,562 --> 00:51:40,826
When you in the box
and they saw you in half?

686
00:51:40,897 --> 00:51:43,923
- I'm at Adele Delisi's.
- It's magic.

687
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,434
We already talked to her.
That's a dead end.

688
00:51:46,503 --> 00:51:51,167
I was just wondering,
if I brought in Chirino,
would you let me be on the task force?

689
00:51:51,241 --> 00:51:53,641
- Yeah, sure, Karen.
- Then they put the saw through,
and they separate it.

690
00:51:53,710 --> 00:51:57,407
- And that's it. Ta da.
- But how do you twinkle your toes?
I don't get that.

691
00:51:57,481 --> 00:52:00,848
You bring Chirino in,
and you can be on the task force.

692
00:52:00,917 --> 00:52:03,511
- That's all I wanted to know.
- Good.

693
00:52:03,587 --> 00:52:06,818
Now, would you forget
about the ex-wife...

694
00:52:06,890 --> 00:52:09,256
and get over to the Adams Hotel?

695
00:52:09,326 --> 00:52:11,988
- You got it.
- Then they open it up...

696
00:52:12,062 --> 00:52:14,758
- No! No!
- Come on.

697
00:52:14,831 --> 00:52:18,631
- And then that's it.
- Fake legs.

698
00:52:18,702 --> 00:52:22,103
- Mmm.
- Fake legs? How you gonna...

699
00:52:22,172 --> 00:52:24,697
- Ay! Cono.
- Thanks, Adele.

700
00:52:24,774 --> 00:52:27,038
How do they twinkle their toes,
then, if it's fake, mira?

701
00:52:30,247 --> 00:52:32,909
First thing we do,
we get to Detroit, we find Glenn...

702
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:36,077
and we find a window
to throw him out of.

703
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:38,087
I was thinkin', if I was Glenn,
and I was up there...

704
00:52:38,155 --> 00:52:40,146
to take down the Ripper,
where would I go?

705
00:52:40,223 --> 00:52:43,215
'Cept that if you were Glenn,
you wouldn't be thinkin'.

706
00:52:43,293 --> 00:52:45,352
Remember Snoopy Miller,
his old pal from the joint?

707
00:52:45,428 --> 00:52:48,192
Snoop? I figured
he'd be brain-dead by now.

708
00:52:48,265 --> 00:52:50,358
Nah, Snoop doesn't box anymore.

709
00:52:50,433 --> 00:52:53,266
Glenn told me that he's managing
some fighters out at the Kronk.

710
00:53:08,485 --> 00:53:11,045
- Did you get the key?
- They're in room 613.

711
00:53:13,823 --> 00:53:17,224
All right. I want
two men outside, front and back.

712
00:53:17,294 --> 00:53:21,993
Conroy, Jamison, go on up to six,
cover both ends of the hall.

713
00:53:23,233 --> 00:53:25,758
You're primary.
You're secondary.

714
00:53:25,835 --> 00:53:28,303
And you're point man.

715
00:53:28,371 --> 00:53:32,068
- You gonna use a ram?
- Yeah. Why?

716
00:53:32,142 --> 00:53:34,337
The manager's door is metal.

717
00:53:34,411 --> 00:53:36,436
You know what I mean,
they might all be.

718
00:53:36,513 --> 00:53:39,812
A ram on a metal door makes
a lot of noise for what good it does.

719
00:53:39,883 --> 00:53:42,750
I got a shock lock round
for my shotgun that oughta do the trick.

720
00:53:42,819 --> 00:53:44,753
Fine. Whatever.

721
00:53:55,398 --> 00:53:57,332
Two, please.

722
00:53:59,636 --> 00:54:01,570
You.

723
00:54:05,675 --> 00:54:09,873
Fuck it.
Let's take the stairs. Karen...

724
00:54:09,946 --> 00:54:13,109
Take the radio. Stay down here
in the lobby and watch the elevator.

725
00:54:13,183 --> 00:54:17,017
- Daniel, I want to go upstairs.
- Well, you can wait
in the car if you want to.

726
00:54:18,688 --> 00:54:21,657
Now, you see Foley and Bragg
coming behind us. What do you do?

727
00:54:21,725 --> 00:54:25,661
- Call and tell you?
- And you let them come up.

728
00:54:25,729 --> 00:54:29,221
You don't try to make
the bust yourself. You understand?

729
00:54:35,405 --> 00:54:37,669
Is this your floor, ma'am?

730
00:54:38,908 --> 00:54:40,842
Is this your floor, ma'am?

731
00:54:40,910 --> 00:54:43,811
Oh. Oh, yes.

732
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:46,713
Yes, it is. I'm sorry. Thank you.

733
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:53,551
Be advised we are
approaching the door.

734
00:55:01,798 --> 00:55:05,791
Be advised we are
going to blow the door.

735
00:55:15,578 --> 00:55:17,512
Going up?

736
00:55:32,629 --> 00:55:34,961
Shit, I thought I was going up.

737
00:55:36,599 --> 00:55:39,500
She just looked right at me.

738
00:55:39,569 --> 00:55:42,766
- Who?
- Karen.

739
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:46,366
- Karen Sisco?
- Yeah.

740
00:55:46,443 --> 00:55:48,434
She's in the lobby.

741
00:55:48,511 --> 00:55:50,445
- She's in the lobby?
- Yeah.

742
00:55:52,282 --> 00:55:55,581
They know where I live,
no doubt they know what I drive.
We gotta dump this car.

743
00:56:04,427 --> 00:56:06,622
She just sat there,
looking right at me.

744
00:56:11,234 --> 00:56:15,193
Karen, they're
not up here. Keep your eyes open.

745
00:56:16,272 --> 00:56:20,470
Karen? Karen, are you there?

746
00:56:20,543 --> 00:56:22,477
He waved at you?
