1
00:00:58,775 --> 00:01:01,107
The best place to meet a guy
is the supermarket.

2
00:01:01,277 --> 00:01:03,973
You see a guy holding a list,
you know he's married.

3
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:08,345
He's in the frozen-food section
carrying a small basket, he's single.

4
00:01:08,518 --> 00:01:12,511
I hang out by fruits and vegetables.
Better chance of getting a guy who's healthy.

5
00:01:13,857 --> 00:01:17,190
Probably the best place
is Home Depot or any hardware store.

6
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,023
You just walk up
to the cutest guy and say:

7
00:01:21,197 --> 00:01:24,928
"Do you know where I can get nailed?
I mean, nails?

8
00:01:25,235 --> 00:01:27,726
Pardon me,
I've been drinking all afternoon."

9
00:01:27,937 --> 00:01:31,338
And that way he knows,
one, that you're easy...

10
00:01:31,541 --> 00:01:33,839
...and two, that you like to drink.

11
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:39,171
I thought a great place to meet girls would
be night school where they teach English.

12
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:41,909
Because these girls
would be from foreign lands...

13
00:01:42,085 --> 00:01:45,145
...and maybe still a little disoriented
from the journey...

14
00:01:45,321 --> 00:01:49,382
...and I would look attractive
because I speak English very goodly.

15
00:01:49,559 --> 00:01:52,187
But in the end,
it did not work out as I had hoped.

16
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:56,662
I mean, basically, I was told to
take a hike in 14 languages.

17
00:01:56,833 --> 00:02:00,234
Where do you meet people?
I don't know, they're everywhere.

18
00:02:01,905 --> 00:02:03,839
Why, is there a problem?

19
00:02:09,913 --> 00:02:12,347
No. No way,
I'm not going out with this guy.

20
00:02:12,515 --> 00:02:15,575
Just call him. Say hello.
He's in my book club.

21
00:02:15,752 --> 00:02:18,016
- Why is there a woman here?
- It's his wife.

22
00:02:18,188 --> 00:02:21,351
They're separated, but he didn't want
to Photoshop her out...

23
00:02:21,524 --> 00:02:23,924
...if you're not interested.
They are in Hawaii.

24
00:02:24,093 --> 00:02:27,221
It's the Four Seasons.
This could be you in the photograph.

25
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:28,895
Aloha.

26
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:31,761
- Well, if you change your mind.
- I've got a picture too.

27
00:02:31,935 --> 00:02:34,460
Is that why you're all here?
The whole family?

28
00:02:34,637 --> 00:02:37,606
- Everyone has a picture for me?
- This is an intervention, Sarah.

29
00:02:37,774 --> 00:02:40,470
- He's great.
- A beautiful girl like you can't just give up.

30
00:02:40,643 --> 00:02:41,871
There's life after divorce.

31
00:02:42,045 --> 00:02:44,536
You were married to the same woman
for 45 years, Dad.

32
00:02:44,714 --> 00:02:47,911
- What do you know about divorce?
- Precious little, I admit.

33
00:02:48,785 --> 00:02:51,310
The black specter of two lives
torn asunder.

34
00:02:51,487 --> 00:02:52,818
Not helping, Dad.

35
00:02:52,989 --> 00:02:55,219
I wish your mother were here,
God rest her soul.

36
00:02:55,558 --> 00:02:58,220
- She'd know what to say.
- "Put on another pot of tea."

37
00:02:58,394 --> 00:03:02,091
That's what she'd say.
The Irish answer to all problems.

38
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:04,426
- Well, it worked most of the time.
- Who is this?

39
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:07,661
I have no idea, but if you're interested,
I'll Google him.

40
00:03:07,837 --> 00:03:10,533
Is this it for food in this house,
like, eight crackers?

41
00:03:10,707 --> 00:03:12,607
And what are these?
Are these bananas?

42
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:15,505
- I think they were at one time.
- I'll take one.

43
00:03:15,678 --> 00:03:18,772
- I guess I forgot to shop this month.
- What are you gonna do, sis?

44
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:22,850
- I mean, really, it's been eight months.
- Dad's giving-up idea sounds intriguing.

45
00:03:23,019 --> 00:03:26,147
I could become the crazy aunt
who moves in down in the basement.

46
00:03:26,322 --> 00:03:29,883
Put a cot in for me, some herbal teas.
I'd like to get a dog, if that's okay?

47
00:03:30,059 --> 00:03:32,584
Marc, don't you have
a friend for Sarah?

48
00:03:32,762 --> 00:03:36,459
"A Friend for Sarah." I'm now an episode
of <i>Little House on the Prairie</i>.

49
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:39,500
- Come on, you must know somebody.
- Not really.

50
00:03:39,669 --> 00:03:43,969
But if you want to have an affair,
I do know a couple of married guys.

51
00:03:45,608 --> 00:03:48,270
- We'll let that be our fallback, okay?
- Okay.

52
00:03:48,444 --> 00:03:51,641
- An affair, that's a terrific idea.
- My husband to the rescue.

53
00:03:51,814 --> 00:03:53,042
Don't cover mine.

54
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:55,684
I think affairs should go
on the other side.

55
00:03:58,955 --> 00:04:00,183
Yeah.

56
00:04:10,033 --> 00:04:11,500
Hey, Jake.

57
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:13,363
Hey, charlie.

58
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:16,702
Divorce is final.

59
00:04:16,873 --> 00:04:18,033
You're a free man.

60
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:21,969
I don't know if... is the
appropriate sentiment. Four years...

61
00:04:22,145 --> 00:04:24,477
...woman I loved, I got my ass kicked.
- High-five.

62
00:04:24,647 --> 00:04:26,137
Not that kind of moment either.

63
00:04:26,316 --> 00:04:28,648
- Down low?
- Just because I want this to stop.

64
00:04:29,552 --> 00:04:31,884
You are officially the worst client
I've ever had.

65
00:04:32,055 --> 00:04:33,920
- Thank you.
- Let Lisa have everything.

66
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:36,558
Even the judge wanted you to keep
those boxing gloves.

67
00:04:36,726 --> 00:04:39,957
- She really liked you.
- I liked her too, as far as judges go.

68
00:04:40,163 --> 00:04:41,687
No. I mean, really.

69
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:46,130
Wow, that's a good-looking cougar.

70
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:50,567
Excellent stuff. You think she'd like
to buy a handmade, stainable teak boat?

71
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,901
Maybe if it came with private lessons.

72
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:55,875
Everybody wants all that Tupperware...

73
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:58,912
...those computer-designed,
fiberglass-composite things.

74
00:04:59,082 --> 00:05:00,982
I mean, don't even look like boats.

75
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:03,710
They look like boats when they
whiz by your wooden guy.

76
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:06,787
That was one race, and I've made
some adjustments, charlie.

77
00:05:07,123 --> 00:05:09,648
- Wood boats can win, trust me on that.
- They can't win.

78
00:05:09,826 --> 00:05:11,418
That's why people don't want them.

79
00:05:11,594 --> 00:05:13,619
They can't win,
but they lose beautifully.

80
00:05:13,796 --> 00:05:16,924
And the whole experience
is just better. Look at this.

81
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,568
I'm making these boats
the exact same way...

82
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:22,796
...the Spanish and the Portuguese
made their ships of exploration.

83
00:05:22,972 --> 00:05:25,532
There's a continuity
at stake here, charlie.

84
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:27,573
This is more than a boat.

85
00:05:27,977 --> 00:05:31,105
- This is a time machine.
- Lf you paid this much attention to Lisa...

86
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,510
...you'd still be together.
- This is true.

87
00:05:34,017 --> 00:05:37,111
But you know what? If I had to do it
it all over again, I wouldn't.

88
00:05:38,821 --> 00:05:42,279
I wouldn't.
Lisa taught me about sadness...

89
00:05:42,525 --> 00:05:44,516
...about human frailty...

90
00:05:44,727 --> 00:05:47,287
...and how unbearably fleeting
happiness can be.

91
00:05:47,463 --> 00:05:50,921
- I'm gonna owe her for the rest of my life.
- Oh, you'll be paying. Monthly.

92
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,998
Hope you don't mind
that I brought Mother Teresa.

93
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:59,233
Are you kidding? I love this girl.
Mother Teresa, do you have a friend for me?

94
00:05:59,409 --> 00:06:01,172
Hey, is everything all right at home?

95
00:06:01,344 --> 00:06:04,472
Yeah, Jennifer just gets tired
of all the family gatherings.

96
00:06:04,647 --> 00:06:06,877
Too many old stories.
It makes her feel left out.

97
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:08,517
Yeah. Kevin used to say that.

98
00:06:08,718 --> 00:06:10,276
- I still say it.
- I say it too.

99
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:13,079
It seems hard now, Sarah, I know...

100
00:06:13,256 --> 00:06:15,850
...but you get a chance to make
a new life for yourself.

101
00:06:16,025 --> 00:06:18,493
Thank you, but in
the marketplace of available women...

102
00:06:18,661 --> 00:06:21,721
Any guy would be lucky to get you.
You're smart, you're funny...

103
00:06:21,898 --> 00:06:24,366
...even pretty when
you're not wallowing in self-pity.

104
00:06:24,534 --> 00:06:25,831
Am I wallowing? Really?

105
00:06:26,002 --> 00:06:28,800
You're not the wallower
in the family. Carol is the wallower.

106
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:31,667
Me? I never wallow.
I suffer in silence.

107
00:06:32,008 --> 00:06:34,408
- No, that's christine.
- Thank you, Michael.

108
00:06:34,577 --> 00:06:36,135
No, no.

109
00:06:37,513 --> 00:06:39,208
- Sylvia Plath.
- This is why people...

110
00:06:39,382 --> 00:06:41,145
...don't have large families anymore.

111
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:43,718
- Bye. I love you.
- Bye.

112
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,951
- Bye, Bill.
- Love you, carol.

113
00:06:46,789 --> 00:06:48,620
- See you, Dad.
- Thank you, I think.

114
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:49,951
Bye, chris. Bye.

115
00:06:50,126 --> 00:06:51,593
- See you later, Dad.
- Bye, Daddy.

116
00:06:51,761 --> 00:06:52,819
Bye.

117
00:06:53,196 --> 00:06:56,893
There's someone special
waiting for you, Sarah.

118
00:06:57,066 --> 00:07:00,593
I know it. Someone worthy.

119
00:07:01,104 --> 00:07:04,301
Kevin was not, on his best day...

120
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:06,998
...good enough for you, sweetheart.

121
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,239
Now you tell me.

122
00:07:29,465 --> 00:07:31,023
Why not?

123
00:07:31,234 --> 00:07:35,432
You know I love you and I love Lisa,
but I think you're both better off.

124
00:07:35,605 --> 00:07:38,506
We sure weren't making each other
happy there at the end.

125
00:07:39,642 --> 00:07:41,507
Or the beginning.

126
00:07:42,111 --> 00:07:43,373
Or the middle.

127
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:48,210
I mean, don't get me wrong, we all
wanted to sleep with Lisa, but marriage...

128
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:50,716
- That's not right.
- I said that out loud, didn't I?

129
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:53,856
- You did.
- I better strike that from the record.

130
00:07:54,023 --> 00:07:57,083
No, lawyers get to do that.
I'm instructing you to disregard that.

131
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:59,990
I think women have
the whole thing planned.

132
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:02,527
Really, the whole thing.

133
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:06,031
An epic narrative in their heads.
You know my theory about this?

134
00:08:06,202 --> 00:08:08,466
When you meet,
they have the whole story written.

135
00:08:08,638 --> 00:08:10,367
But you don't get to read it.

136
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:12,974
But if you go off script...

137
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:15,676
...right? They write you out
of the story.

138
00:08:15,845 --> 00:08:17,574
I got written out of Act 3.

139
00:08:17,847 --> 00:08:21,248
Now you're in Act 4, where I get you
banged every night of the week.

140
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:23,977
Charlie, I'm toast. I just got shredded.
I am...

141
00:08:24,187 --> 00:08:26,951
- It's time, healing time. I'm on the bench.
- Hey. Hey.

142
00:08:27,123 --> 00:08:30,684
I'm out of the game.
Bench me, bench me.

143
00:08:31,294 --> 00:08:32,488
- Hey.
- Benched.

144
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:19,407
I'll be right with you.

145
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:23,743
- Hi. Can I help you?
- Single chicken breast, please.

146
00:09:23,913 --> 00:09:26,473
For an extra 75 cents,
you can get the whole fryer here.

147
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:28,446
Two breasts, two thighs and a wing.

148
00:09:28,618 --> 00:09:30,848
Thank you. I don't know
when I'd eat all that.

149
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:33,580
- It's just an extra 75 cents.
- It's not the 75 cents.

150
00:09:33,789 --> 00:09:35,347
I hate to see food go bad.

151
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:38,817
We got a hundred recipes.
You can cook them, freeze them and...

152
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:42,289
Look, listen to me, mister.
I'm divorced, okay?

153
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:44,625
I eat alone,
usually standing over the sink.

154
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,893
I don't want chicken
hanging around, okay?

155
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:50,032
- Okay.
- Thank you.

156
00:10:26,275 --> 00:10:29,005
Hey. There she is.

157
00:10:33,582 --> 00:10:36,847
- Good morning. How are you?
- Good morning.

158
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:40,113
I called you last night
to see if you were up for a movie...

159
00:10:40,289 --> 00:10:44,783
...or bowling or group shampooing.
- I'm sorry. Eric's parents are in town.

160
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,360
Mr. And Mrs. Stalin.
I'm under house arrest.

161
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:49,122
- Weren't they just here?
- Thank you.

162
00:10:49,298 --> 00:10:52,825
I don't know why they can't stay at
a hotel. Nothing I do makes them happy.

163
00:10:53,035 --> 00:10:55,868
And they make Eric so nervous,
he's like the Tin Man.

164
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:58,973
You have to hang in there, Leo.
You and Eric are my model...

165
00:10:59,141 --> 00:11:02,076
...for a successful relationship.
- I fear for you, child.

166
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:05,441
Anyone have anything exciting
happen this weekend to share?

167
00:11:05,614 --> 00:11:07,206
My Uncle Mike slept over.

168
00:11:07,383 --> 00:11:10,250
Uncles and aunts
are very important to us, aren't they?

169
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:14,412
He's not really my uncle,
but my mommy makes me call him that.

170
00:11:15,725 --> 00:11:20,162
When he's there, I can't sleep with
my mommy because he's in her bed.

171
00:11:21,163 --> 00:11:23,563
Anyone else have anything
they'd like to share?

172
00:11:23,733 --> 00:11:25,132
Yes, Austin.

173
00:11:25,301 --> 00:11:27,326
My parents are trying it
apart for a while.

174
00:11:27,503 --> 00:11:29,664
- We have a theme, June.
- Yes, we do.

175
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:34,242
And Mom says my dad is incorrigible.
That means he likes other women.

176
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,477
Good.

177
00:11:39,682 --> 00:11:40,910
One, two.

178
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:43,140
Let me try.

179
00:11:43,319 --> 00:11:44,946
That's a hop.

180
00:11:46,522 --> 00:11:49,958
One, two, that's a new step.
Very good.

181
00:11:50,359 --> 00:11:53,021
- Molly, you wanna try the sticks?
- Yeah, come on, Molly.

182
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:58,625
Very good. Keep it going like that.

183
00:11:59,402 --> 00:12:01,461
- Watch.
- No, I'm doing it.

184
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:04,503
Austin!

185
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:07,302
Good Lord, it's a gusher.

186
00:12:13,849 --> 00:12:15,749
Let me see your teeth.

187
00:12:16,552 --> 00:12:18,747
- Hey, bubba.
- Look who's here.

188
00:12:18,954 --> 00:12:20,285
Daddy!

189
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:23,585
- Are you all right?
- Yep, I'm fine.

190
00:12:24,126 --> 00:12:27,061
He had a decent bloody nose
for a while, but he's fine now.

191
00:12:27,229 --> 00:12:31,359
- You didn't have to rush right over.
- A kid bleeds, I show up. It's house rules.

192
00:12:31,534 --> 00:12:33,627
- You wanna get your stuff together now?
- Yeah.

193
00:12:33,803 --> 00:12:37,034
- Then I need a minute alone with Ms. Nolan.
- Okay. Bye, Ms. Nolan.

194
00:12:37,206 --> 00:12:38,969
Bye.

195
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:55,422
No. No. No.

196
00:12:56,725 --> 00:12:58,215
So, Ms. Nolan...

197
00:12:58,461 --> 00:13:00,861
- Sarah, please.
- And I'm Bob.

198
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,725
Actually, everybody calls me Bobby.

199
00:13:02,932 --> 00:13:05,093
I've been trying to change it
since third grade.

200
00:13:05,267 --> 00:13:06,632
I'm a pushover for Bobbys...

201
00:13:06,802 --> 00:13:10,670
...ever since my first boyfriend,
Bobby Healy, just...

202
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,102
You know?

203
00:13:12,341 --> 00:13:16,778
I forget, is it "always discuss your personal
history with parents" or "never discuss"?

204
00:13:16,946 --> 00:13:20,404
It's "always discuss."
Besides, I find it comforting.

205
00:13:20,616 --> 00:13:23,016
So has Austin told you
anything about...?

206
00:13:23,185 --> 00:13:24,709
- About you and...
- Yeah.

207
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:28,879
That you're taking a break from
your marriage and you're incorrigible.

208
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:30,753
That phrasing came from his mother.

209
00:13:30,926 --> 00:13:33,656
- I wouldn't have put it that way, but...
- I'm sorry.

210
00:13:33,829 --> 00:13:36,297
If there's anything you think
I need to know, tell me.

211
00:13:36,465 --> 00:13:38,695
- I will.
- Sometimes with Austin, you can forget.

212
00:13:38,868 --> 00:13:40,699
- Because he seems so mature.
- I know.

213
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:43,202
The other day he asked
about my retirement plan.

214
00:13:43,372 --> 00:13:46,773
Well, he cares about you, and he
wants you to be financially secure.

215
00:13:47,476 --> 00:13:50,445
You know Austin adores you.
I can see why.

216
00:13:50,846 --> 00:13:54,043
- Thank you, Bob.
- I might prefer Bobby after all.

217
00:13:54,216 --> 00:13:56,776
I mean, I like the...
I like the history.

218
00:14:04,994 --> 00:14:08,191
Two guys alone in the afternoon
watching <i>Doctor Zhivago</i>.

219
00:14:08,364 --> 00:14:11,595
- There's something gravely wrong here.
- It's all there, man.

220
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,200
The yearning, the suffering,
a woman you'll pursue...

221
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:16,270
...through blizzards, across continents.

222
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:19,566
A love so real,
even after you're dead it still hurts.

223
00:14:19,742 --> 00:14:22,142
- That's all I want.
- You need to get out.

224
00:14:22,311 --> 00:14:25,280
- You do. You need to see real people.
- You wanna watch it again?

225
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:28,678
No. I want to go out. Come on,
I previewed some Internet ads for us.

226
00:14:28,851 --> 00:14:31,911
Internet ads? Come on,
I want Zhivago's Internet ad:

227
00:14:32,087 --> 00:14:35,648
"Tragic doctor/poet
in desperate pain seeks...

228
00:14:35,891 --> 00:14:39,827
...like-minded playmate
for long snowshoe across Eurasia."

229
00:14:40,029 --> 00:14:42,190
What do you bet he gets
a hundred responses?

230
00:14:42,364 --> 00:14:45,060
We'll start with bisexual
Asian women who fly-fish.

231
00:14:45,234 --> 00:14:47,828
- No Internet ads.
- This is for you. I hate to fly-fish.

232
00:14:48,003 --> 00:14:49,664
- No, you don't.
- What about Sherry?

233
00:14:49,838 --> 00:14:52,705
- I gave you her number. You never called.
- Sherry?

234
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:56,709
Sherry's 24. Her range of interest
extends from kickboxing to Tae Bo.

235
00:14:56,879 --> 00:14:59,006
She slept with half the guys
in my office.

236
00:14:59,181 --> 00:15:01,274
Then why do you want
to set me up with her?

237
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:04,782
She slept with half the guys
in my office.

238
00:15:04,954 --> 00:15:08,014
She's in her early 2os. You know
the epic narrative I talked about?

239
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:10,920
Hers would not only be secret,
it would be incoherent.

240
00:15:11,093 --> 00:15:13,220
I wouldn't get past the cover page.

241
00:15:14,229 --> 00:15:17,027
I mean, I'm looking
for something more than Sherry.

242
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:19,895
"Hopelessly romantic,
young 5os widower...

243
00:15:20,069 --> 00:15:23,971
...seeks lady friend who enjoys
the slow bloom of affection.

244
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:28,200
Loves dogs, children
and long, meandering bike rides.

245
00:15:28,377 --> 00:15:30,311
I will be carrying
a single yellow rose."

246
00:15:31,413 --> 00:15:34,246
- I gotta meet this guy.
- Where are your boob shirts?

247
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:36,416
- My what?
- Your boob shirts.

248
00:15:36,619 --> 00:15:40,350
- Don't worry, I brought some of mine.
- Oh, boob shirts.

249
00:15:40,589 --> 00:15:43,990
- I can't wear that.
- Okay, I have some dating tips for you.

250
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:46,593
I got them from <i>Sports Illustrated</i>.
Solid gold.

251
00:15:46,762 --> 00:15:50,163
Yes, that's always been my bible
for personal relationships.

252
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,196
At least listen to the tips.

253
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:55,064
- Your sister has gone to a lot of trouble.
- Okay.

254
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:58,431
"One, maintain eye contact.

255
00:15:58,641 --> 00:16:02,509
But be sure it isn't too intense.
You aren't a hawk eyeing its prey."

256
00:16:02,678 --> 00:16:05,203
Good that you told me.
I might have done my hawk thing.

257
00:16:05,414 --> 00:16:10,579
"Two, men respond sexually when
they think women are excited by them."

258
00:16:10,753 --> 00:16:12,880
- Really?
- "The more you like what you see...

259
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:16,821
...the more your pupils
will open wide to take it all in."

260
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:20,491
Open your pupils.

261
00:16:21,764 --> 00:16:22,890
Oh, my God.

262
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:25,693
- I'm dating again. I can't do this!
- It's okay. Come on.

263
00:16:25,868 --> 00:16:28,132
- No, you'll be fine, it's okay.
- It'll be fun.

264
00:16:28,303 --> 00:16:30,771
What if he wants to have sex?
What if I want to?

265
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:35,476
You don't understand. It's been
a long time, christine. I could freak out.

266
00:16:35,678 --> 00:16:37,270
What if I can't control myself?

267
00:16:37,446 --> 00:16:41,473
You're meeting for muffins
in a public place. I think you'll be safe.

268
00:16:56,632 --> 00:16:58,429
- Dad?
- Sarah.

269
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,830
My darling girl.

270
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,735
Darling, don't you put
the sunshine to shame.

271
00:17:03,906 --> 00:17:05,430
What are you doing here?

272
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:09,202
That's a fine how-do-you-do
from one of my favorite daughters.

273
00:17:09,378 --> 00:17:12,973
I'm sorry, it's just that I'm meeting a...
why do you have a yellow...?

274
00:17:14,817 --> 00:17:18,583
- Is that a rose?
- It is a rose, if the truth be told.

275
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:20,812
But by any other name...

276
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:24,923
- And it's for a lady friend, isn't it?
- That is, in fact, the very purpose.

277
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:29,663
- No!
- Now, Sarah, come on.

278
00:17:29,898 --> 00:17:34,858
It is a natural course of this life that
your dad would have a lady friend by now.

279
00:17:35,037 --> 00:17:37,801
I feel your mother whispering her
approval to me every day.

280
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:41,204
And would this lady friend
be someone who might enjoy...

281
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:43,401
...the slow bloom of affection, perhaps?

282
00:17:43,579 --> 00:17:45,171
That would be grand, yes.

283
00:17:46,415 --> 00:17:47,814
I'm your date, Dad.

284
00:17:49,251 --> 00:17:52,379
I am. I answered
my own father's personal ad.

285
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:55,786
Don't laugh. It's not funny!

286
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:58,984
It shows I brought you up to know
the diamond from the riffraff.

287
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:01,823
A young 5o, Dad? You're 71.

288
00:18:02,397 --> 00:18:04,422
And when was the last time
you rode a bike?

289
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:08,092
- Meandering or any other way?
- Well, think of it as poetry, darling.

290
00:18:08,303 --> 00:18:11,363
As who I am
in the bottom of my soul.

291
00:18:11,974 --> 00:18:14,772
And, Sarah, my darling.

292
00:18:14,943 --> 00:18:18,037
- What?
- I'm glad you've started dating again.

293
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,473
Dad, please. This is disturbing
on so many levels.

294
00:18:23,051 --> 00:18:25,713
- At least let me have the rose.
- I can't.

295
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:28,216
I'm seeing someone else at 4:oo.

296
00:18:38,667 --> 00:18:42,296
<i>Hello. You've reached Sarah Nolan.</i>
<i>Leave a message if you want to.</i>

297
00:18:42,604 --> 00:18:45,334
<i>Sarah, it's me, Christine. Pick up.</i>

298
00:18:46,241 --> 00:18:49,142
<i>Come on, Sarah,</i>
<i>I already talked to Dad.</i>

299
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:56,908
- Who else knows?
- <i>No one.</i>

300
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:59,354
Come on, carol has to know.

301
00:18:59,521 --> 00:19:03,389
<i>Why does Carol have to know? Couldn't</i>
<i>I once know something before she does?</i>

302
00:19:03,792 --> 00:19:06,022
She's there with you, isn't she?

303
00:19:06,195 --> 00:19:09,221
- <i>No.</i>
- Hello, carol.

304
00:19:09,531 --> 00:19:13,433
<i>Hi, Sarah. I was telling Chris it's a shame</i>
<i>I didn't know about this before...</i>

305
00:19:13,602 --> 00:19:16,833
<i>... because I could have called</i>
<i>Uncle Chet. We could have doubled.</i>

306
00:19:17,005 --> 00:19:19,098
<i>Oh, no.</i>

307
00:19:19,842 --> 00:19:24,108
This story is going to be immortalized
into family history, isn't it?

308
00:19:24,279 --> 00:19:27,942
Told and retold
at Thanksgiving dinner, year after year.

309
00:19:28,116 --> 00:19:32,143
<i>Oh, not just Thanksgiving.</i>
<i>I think it's a good Christmas story too.</i>

310
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:34,180
- Bye, guys.
- <i>Wait.</i>

311
00:19:34,356 --> 00:19:37,951
<i>Tell the truth. On a scale of one to 10,</i>
<i>how would you rate Dad as a date?</i>

312
00:19:38,126 --> 00:19:39,991
<i>Hot, super hot?</i>

313
00:19:47,336 --> 00:19:50,169
Don't be mad at me for this, okay?

314
00:19:50,339 --> 00:19:53,604
The last time you said that to me
you stole my boyfriend. Danny Shea.

315
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:56,608
I did not steal Danny Shea.

316
00:19:56,778 --> 00:20:01,010
- I haven't forgiven you, by the way.
- Stop. He was a terrible kisser.

317
00:20:01,183 --> 00:20:05,017
- He kissed just fine with me.
- Okay. Here goes.

318
00:20:05,187 --> 00:20:07,417
I went online, pretended I was you...

319
00:20:07,589 --> 00:20:11,184
...and put your profile
on PerfectMatch. Com.

320
00:20:13,061 --> 00:20:15,120
You're making this up.

321
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:18,021
You can't just sit back
and passively answer...

322
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:21,431
...other people's ads anymore.
We are on offense.

323
00:20:21,603 --> 00:20:25,004
Well, forgive me if I'm a tad gun-shy
after my last date with my father.

324
00:20:25,173 --> 00:20:28,438
Come on, at least look at your profile.

325
00:20:29,044 --> 00:20:30,978
That's my high school
graduation picture.

326
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:33,614
That's all I had.
That or your wedding photo.

327
00:20:33,782 --> 00:20:35,340
"Voluptuous"? Carol!

328
00:20:35,517 --> 00:20:38,884
Every woman listed claims
to be at least voluptuous.

329
00:20:39,087 --> 00:20:43,217
Some are "gorgeous inside and out,"
most are "sexually confident."

330
00:20:43,392 --> 00:20:48,159
"Voluptuous, sensuous DwF seeks
special man to share starlit nights.

331
00:20:48,363 --> 00:20:50,695
- Must love dogs."
- I put that in for you.

332
00:20:50,866 --> 00:20:52,800
And yet I'm still pissed.

333
00:20:52,968 --> 00:20:57,337
I must have done something right.
You have 18 responses.

334
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:59,573
You listened to them, didn't you?

335
00:20:59,741 --> 00:21:03,006
I like three, 11 and 14.
Christine likes two and eight.

336
00:21:03,211 --> 00:21:07,011
Michael liked them all.
But you decide for yourself.

337
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:41,649
<i>What do you mean by voluptuous?</i>
<i>Do you mean big breasts...</i>

338
00:21:41,817 --> 00:21:43,682
<i>... or do you mean fat?</i>

339
00:21:45,454 --> 00:21:46,682
<i>I love dogs too.</i>

340
00:21:46,855 --> 00:21:50,518
<i>I have a great sense of humor,</i>
<i>but you could probably already tell that.</i>

341
00:21:51,093 --> 00:21:52,526
<i>Yo.</i>

342
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:55,958
<i>My name is Walter Taylor.</i>
<i>I'm an attorney.</i>

343
00:21:56,131 --> 00:22:00,659
<i>Don't hang up.</i>
<i>I like opera. Don't delete me.</i>

344
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:04,498
So anyway, I get all dressed up...

345
00:22:04,673 --> 00:22:07,335
...and I walk down the stairs and I see...

346
00:22:07,509 --> 00:22:12,674
...my father sitting there
holding a single yellow rose.

347
00:22:12,881 --> 00:22:14,439
And it dawns on me...

348
00:22:15,384 --> 00:22:19,343
- Is something wrong?
- Well, no offense, it's just...

349
00:22:21,056 --> 00:22:23,217
I thought you'd be younger, that's all.

350
00:22:25,293 --> 00:22:28,592
Well, you said your age range
was 25 to 45.

351
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:31,426
I guess I was hoping more for 25.

352
00:22:32,968 --> 00:22:34,560
Twenty-three.

353
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:37,833
Eighteen. That's legal.

354
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:43,469
It's nice to be out.

355
00:22:43,645 --> 00:22:45,579
I've been feeling kind of blue lately.

356
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:49,444
I know, you mentioned on the phone,
Lennie, that you've... Kind of depressed.

357
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:52,178
- Did I cry?
- Well, a little bit.

358
00:22:52,354 --> 00:22:55,846
I've been on 17 first dates this year.

359
00:22:56,324 --> 00:22:58,224
No second dates.

360
00:22:58,827 --> 00:23:01,022
One went...

361
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:04,328
...to check her coat
and never came back.

362
00:23:04,666 --> 00:23:09,035
One jumped out at the light
when it changed.

363
00:23:09,204 --> 00:23:14,073
Well, we're almost through the salad.
That's a good sign.

364
00:23:16,078 --> 00:23:17,602
No.

365
00:23:18,146 --> 00:23:19,738
Lennie.

366
00:23:19,915 --> 00:23:21,815
Please. Don't.

367
00:23:23,251 --> 00:23:26,709
Please. Lennie. No.

368
00:23:28,023 --> 00:23:31,186
<i>If you're happy and you know it</i>
<i>Clap your hands</i>

369
00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:33,224
come on!
<i>If you're happy</i>

370
00:23:33,395 --> 00:23:35,863
<i>And you know it</i>
<i>Clap your hands</i>

371
00:23:37,232 --> 00:23:38,460
oh, God!

372
00:23:38,633 --> 00:23:40,362
Come on, get up.
Get her. Get her.

373
00:23:41,069 --> 00:23:42,627
Damn.

374
00:23:43,271 --> 00:23:45,296
Don't be upset.
I come from a large family.

375
00:23:45,474 --> 00:23:48,341
Lots of male cousins, brothers.
Used to this sort of thing.

376
00:23:48,877 --> 00:23:50,139
Three out of five.

377
00:23:50,312 --> 00:23:52,678
- Oh, that's all right. Maybe later.
- Come on.

378
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:55,908
- Your table's almost ready.
- Good. We're working up an appetite.

379
00:23:56,084 --> 00:23:58,712
Food here is fabulous.
It's not cheap, though.

380
00:23:58,887 --> 00:24:01,253
Well, I offered to pay my half.

381
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,385
And what did I tell you?

382
00:24:03,558 --> 00:24:06,288
"Marshall's girls don't pay."

383
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:07,927
Beautiful.

384
00:24:08,296 --> 00:24:10,196
You'd look really good in handcuffs.

385
00:24:19,808 --> 00:24:22,402
Charlie, my boy,
some nice-looking pieces here.

386
00:24:22,677 --> 00:24:25,043
- Really? I didn't see anyone.
- I meant the artwork.

387
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:27,113
- Bet this cost a bundle.
- Hey, guys.

388
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:29,850
- Hi!
- Speaking of artwork.

389
00:24:30,519 --> 00:24:33,283
- Hi, Sherry.
- Hi, charlie. Hi, Jake.

390
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:35,420
How are you? Let's do two.

391
00:24:36,191 --> 00:24:38,853
- That's how they do it in France.
- You having fun?

392
00:24:39,027 --> 00:24:41,621
Well, I feel sorry for the artist
at these things.

393
00:24:41,796 --> 00:24:45,357
All this talent on display,
and everybody here's just trying to get laid.

394
00:24:45,534 --> 00:24:47,024
I know I am.

395
00:24:47,202 --> 00:24:50,262
You never called me, mister.
I waited and waited.

396
00:24:50,438 --> 00:24:52,099
I know I am.

397
00:24:52,307 --> 00:24:57,267
I'm sorry, Sherry, it's just that I'm not ready
right now to be in a serious relationship.

398
00:24:57,512 --> 00:25:00,310
And with somebody as wonderful
and as beautiful as you...

399
00:25:00,482 --> 00:25:03,349
...I just wouldn't expect
anything less.

400
00:25:04,619 --> 00:25:07,247
- Why can't you be sweet like that, huh?
- Sherry!

401
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:10,249
- Hey, guys.
- Short attention span.

402
00:25:10,458 --> 00:25:12,221
You're a sick guy, you know that?

403
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:16,089
Just another in a long line
of colossal mistakes.

404
00:25:16,731 --> 00:25:19,256
I'm not answering an Internet ad.

405
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:22,597
Look at this. "Voluptuous and sensuous.
Must love dogs." wonderful.

406
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:24,398
Look at the picture.

407
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:28,000
Well, she is appealing.

408
00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:31,142
She'll be good-looking
when she grows up.

409
00:25:31,313 --> 00:25:33,042
I'm surfing porn sites like always...

410
00:25:33,215 --> 00:25:35,615
...I keep getting kicked over
to PerfectMatch. Com...

411
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:37,581
...which is not where I want to be...

412
00:25:37,752 --> 00:25:42,189
...and this girl's profile keeps repeating, like
a sign from heaven. And I thought of you.

413
00:25:42,357 --> 00:25:44,848
Tell the prom queen thanks, but no.
I'm still benched.

414
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:47,221
Too late. You're meeting her at 11.
Bring a dog.

415
00:25:47,395 --> 00:25:48,692
No, I'm not.

416
00:26:00,942 --> 00:26:02,500
It's okay.

417
00:26:03,511 --> 00:26:05,308
Stop that growling!

418
00:26:06,181 --> 00:26:08,115
Use your words.

419
00:26:09,251 --> 00:26:10,650
Stop, sit.

420
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:12,343
Stop, sit.

421
00:26:12,554 --> 00:26:15,148
- Stop. Sit.
- I don't think he knows "stop" or "sit."

422
00:26:15,323 --> 00:26:18,258
- What else have you got?
- Bruno, focus.

423
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:20,223
Roll over and play dead.

424
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:25,155
- Hey, look at that. Look at that.
- That's very impressive.

425
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:30,035
- You Sarah?
- Jake.

426
00:26:30,205 --> 00:26:32,833
- Yeah, hi.
- Yeah. Hi.

427
00:26:34,509 --> 00:26:37,740
I didn't recognize you
without the cap and gown.

428
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:39,674
Oh, yeah.

429
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:41,372
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

430
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:45,779
- This is really amazing.
- Yeah.

431
00:26:46,921 --> 00:26:49,412
It is. When he plays dead,
he really plays dead.

432
00:26:49,591 --> 00:26:53,027
You don't know the half of it.
He can stop his heart like a Sufi mystic.

433
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:56,493
- Does he sleep on a doggy bed of nails?
- As a matter of fact, he does.

434
00:26:56,665 --> 00:26:59,429
He feels nothing.
Or perhaps he feels too much.

435
00:27:02,203 --> 00:27:04,364
- I think he wants his treat now.
- You think so?

436
00:27:04,572 --> 00:27:06,836
While he's playing dead?
It might ruin the effect.

437
00:27:07,008 --> 00:27:10,341
- I don't know. He's your dog.
- He's not. He's my friend charlie's.

438
00:27:10,512 --> 00:27:13,174
- So you're here under false pretenses.
- No, not at all.

439
00:27:13,348 --> 00:27:17,079
You said "must love dogs,"
not "must own dogs." I do love dogs.

440
00:27:17,485 --> 00:27:19,749
In fact, I had one with my ex.

441
00:27:19,921 --> 00:27:22,253
She was allergic,
went into anaphylactic shock.

442
00:27:22,424 --> 00:27:24,392
So we had to put her down. Dog.

443
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:27,027
Not the wife. I'm kidding about both.

444
00:27:28,096 --> 00:27:31,224
This is a beautiful canine
you have here.

445
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:33,959
- Hi.
- Yes, this is Mother Teresa.

446
00:27:35,337 --> 00:27:38,238
Yeah, she plays with lepers?

447
00:27:38,707 --> 00:27:41,608
Comforts the poor? Yeah.
How long you had her?

448
00:27:41,776 --> 00:27:45,337
Technically, she's not really mine.
She's my brother's.

449
00:27:45,513 --> 00:27:48,311
I'm shocked and saddened.

450
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:52,645
- False pretenses.
- Well, we are related. She's family.

451
00:27:52,821 --> 00:27:56,780
And I do really love dogs,
and my ex was allergic also.

452
00:27:56,958 --> 00:27:59,654
Yes, he often had
"anaphyphlectic" shock.

453
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:01,259
You're making that up.

454
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:05,064
- Yes, I am.
- Me too.

455
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:09,570
Tell me, I'm just curious
about one thing.

456
00:28:09,738 --> 00:28:11,399
Why did you write "voluptuous"?

457
00:28:12,907 --> 00:28:15,205
- Oh, my...
- No! I did not mean to be rude at all.

458
00:28:15,377 --> 00:28:18,244
It's just that voluptuous,
that tends to go the other way...

459
00:28:18,413 --> 00:28:19,937
...when someone uses that phrase.

460
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:22,140
Towards the full-figured end
of the spectrum.

461
00:28:22,317 --> 00:28:24,649
I didn't know there was
a full-figured spectrum.

462
00:28:24,819 --> 00:28:27,287
It's one of those words
they use in personal ads...

463
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:30,219
...like "Rubenesque"
or "weight proportionate to height."

464
00:28:30,392 --> 00:28:32,986
Hey, it's your ad. You can say
whatever you want, I'm...

465
00:28:33,161 --> 00:28:38,360
Just for the record, girl says "athletic,"
she means "flat-chested." which you're not.

466
00:28:38,533 --> 00:28:40,763
But... This isn't coming out right.

467
00:28:41,736 --> 00:28:43,294
Look, you know, I'm sorry.

468
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:46,929
I'm... I'm a little nervous. I'm not used
to meeting people this way.

469
00:28:47,108 --> 00:28:49,099
Really? You seem very practiced
and smooth.

470
00:28:51,179 --> 00:28:54,671
- Your ad doesn't do you justice.
- Well, maybe you should rewrite my ad.

471
00:28:54,883 --> 00:28:57,215
- Well, maybe I don't want to.
- And why not?

472
00:28:57,385 --> 00:29:00,183
Because maybe I don't want
anyone else to answer it.

473
00:29:01,022 --> 00:29:03,013
Did you plan on saying
that sometime today?

474
00:29:03,191 --> 00:29:07,150
- No, I didn't. But it's good, isn't it?
- It is good.

475
00:29:07,362 --> 00:29:11,196
- It's a good line.
- Maybe we should try this over again.

476
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,495
Hi, I'm Jake.

477
00:29:13,701 --> 00:29:15,168
Sarah.

478
00:29:15,537 --> 00:29:18,734
So why would you even write an ad?
You don't seem that desperate.

479
00:29:18,907 --> 00:29:21,068
Why would you answer one?
Talk about desperate.

480
00:29:21,242 --> 00:29:24,177
I'm not. I mean, I didn't.
It was my friend's. He gave it to me.

481
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:26,745
- I didn't write it. My sister did.
- Your sister's ad.

482
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:29,650
Your brother's dog.
Those your shoes?

483
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:33,416
Oh, my. Look at the time!
Come on, honey.

484
00:29:33,621 --> 00:29:36,112
What I'm trying to say is
I'd like to get to know you.

485
00:29:36,291 --> 00:29:39,692
I have to get this dog home, and you
don't want to go over on your rental.

486
00:29:40,562 --> 00:29:43,588
Maybe we could try this another time.
You know, without the dogs.

487
00:29:44,265 --> 00:29:45,755
You bet.

488
00:29:47,168 --> 00:29:48,533
I'll call you.

489
00:29:50,472 --> 00:29:51,939
Sarah, for the record...

490
00:29:52,106 --> 00:29:55,234
...you are kind of voluptuous
in a minimalist sort of way.

491
00:30:01,349 --> 00:30:04,477
I'm not sure I'm up for this dinner
at Dad's new girlfriend's house.

492
00:30:04,652 --> 00:30:07,485
- He seems really excited about her.
- Where are Marc and Jason?

493
00:30:07,655 --> 00:30:09,316
They took the kids
to Magic Mountain.

494
00:30:09,491 --> 00:30:12,392
The kids didn't even really
want to go. The dads whined.

495
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,653
Well, they're so spoiled, those dads.

496
00:30:14,863 --> 00:30:17,093
So how was your day today?
At the dog park?

497
00:30:17,265 --> 00:30:20,393
- How did you know about that?
- Who do you think you're dealing with?

498
00:30:20,568 --> 00:30:22,900
- You're good. I have to give you that.
- So come on.

499
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:24,402
- Tell me.
- Okay.

500
00:30:24,572 --> 00:30:27,769
We got off to kind of a rough start.
But then it was okay, you know?

501
00:30:27,942 --> 00:30:31,241
He was a little intense. He was nervous.
He couldn't stop insulting me.

502
00:30:31,412 --> 00:30:33,073
You know what this sounds like.

503
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:36,342
- No, it's not. Don't say it.
- But it is. It's a growth opportunity.

504
00:30:36,518 --> 00:30:39,578
I'm not over my last growth opportunity
when you stole Danny Shea.

505
00:30:39,754 --> 00:30:43,155
Will you forget Danny Shea?
He's probably a convicted felon...

506
00:30:43,324 --> 00:30:45,019
...by now, divorced.

507
00:30:45,226 --> 00:30:46,989
- Maybe you should call him.
- Carol.

508
00:30:47,161 --> 00:30:50,597
What about that guy you met
at preschool? You maimed his kid?

509
00:30:50,798 --> 00:30:53,096
- Bob connor.
- Yeah. Mr. Incorrigible.

510
00:30:53,301 --> 00:30:56,065
I told you, I can't.
He's the father of one of my students.

511
00:30:56,237 --> 00:30:59,968
Yes, honey, but he's not your father.
That's a big step forward for you.

512
00:31:01,242 --> 00:31:03,540
- Bill.
- Dolly.

513
00:31:13,354 --> 00:31:15,288
Hey!

514
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:32,971
- What a lovely home you have, Dolly.
- Thank you.

515
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:36,633
When my third husband died,
I decided to give up the big house.

516
00:31:36,844 --> 00:31:39,608
Third out of how many?

517
00:31:40,582 --> 00:31:42,516
And these potholders?

518
00:31:43,418 --> 00:31:45,079
Where did you manage to find them?

519
00:31:45,253 --> 00:31:48,950
Why, everything in this house
is handmade by Dolly.

520
00:31:49,123 --> 00:31:51,455
Oh, yes. She's very creative.

521
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:54,423
Our mother used to sew all our clothes
when we were younger.

522
00:31:54,596 --> 00:31:56,393
- Sarah.
- Well, she did.

523
00:31:56,598 --> 00:31:59,829
Your father told me
all about your mother, honey.

524
00:32:00,034 --> 00:32:02,127
She must have been
a very special lady.

525
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:05,533
- She was.
- And you must miss her very much.

526
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:07,668
- I do.
- And you see me...

527
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:09,901
...as something of an interloper,
I suppose.

528
00:32:10,511 --> 00:32:12,741
Do you want me to lie down for this?

529
00:32:15,249 --> 00:32:17,581
We're at interloping?
When did that happen?

530
00:32:17,785 --> 00:32:20,049
It's Dad's life. I don't meddle.

531
00:32:20,288 --> 00:32:22,518
Carol, you meddle
in my life all the time.

532
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:26,319
Well, technically that's not true,
because you don't have a life.

533
00:32:26,494 --> 00:32:28,189
I happen to have a very full life.

534
00:32:28,429 --> 00:32:30,226
Did you even check
all of your messages?

535
00:32:30,398 --> 00:32:32,559
I thought a few were very promising.

536
00:32:32,767 --> 00:32:35,930
- Like who?
- Like the engineer from oxnard.

537
00:32:36,104 --> 00:32:39,301
- With the sexual dysfunction.
- In what way would he be promising?

538
00:32:39,507 --> 00:32:41,998
You could cure him.
The whole nurse-patient thing.

539
00:32:42,176 --> 00:32:45,634
- You've got it all worked out.
- It was brave of him to be so forthcoming.

540
00:32:45,813 --> 00:32:47,906
- Why don't you call him, then.
- Why don't you.

541
00:32:48,082 --> 00:32:50,243
- Call! I'll give you his number.
- Maybe I will.

542
00:32:50,418 --> 00:32:51,407
- Go for it.
- Okay.

543
00:32:51,586 --> 00:32:53,451
Hey there. Ms. Nolan.

544
00:32:54,489 --> 00:32:56,957
What are you doing yelling
in whispering Breeze Park?

545
00:32:57,125 --> 00:32:58,683
Look who it is.

546
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:01,124
- What a surprise.
- Oh, hi, Ms. Nolan. How are you?

547
00:33:01,295 --> 00:33:03,490
- Hi, sweetie.
- Who's that?

548
00:33:03,698 --> 00:33:06,064
- Oh, this is my sister carol.
- Nice to meet you.

549
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:10,762
This is Austin, my student,
and his dad, Mr. Connor. Bob.

550
00:33:10,938 --> 00:33:12,599
Actually, I go by Bobby now.

551
00:33:12,974 --> 00:33:14,566
Right. You live here?

552
00:33:14,776 --> 00:33:17,336
Yeah, they cater to the recently
separated and divorced.

553
00:33:17,512 --> 00:33:20,879
But I'm the youngest guy here
by 4o years, so it's good for my morale.

554
00:33:21,616 --> 00:33:24,881
- My wife and I are gonna try it apart.
- I know.

555
00:33:26,688 --> 00:33:28,383
Will you just look at her, son?

556
00:33:28,556 --> 00:33:30,956
Is my little girl lovely
or is my little girl lovely?

557
00:33:31,325 --> 00:33:33,759
Oh, Dad, don't worry
about embarrassing me.

558
00:33:33,928 --> 00:33:36,692
Stop it, Bill.
She is cute as a button, though.

559
00:33:36,898 --> 00:33:40,527
So, what is it you do, Bobby?
Sarah never tells us about her beaus.

560
00:33:40,702 --> 00:33:42,897
I'm finishing my Ph.D.
In American history.

561
00:33:43,071 --> 00:33:45,835
- A biography of Robert E. Lee.
- I always felt sorry for Lee.

562
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:49,066
Forced to fight against his old friends
and west Point classmates.

563
00:33:49,243 --> 00:33:50,642
Could only dress in gray. Sad.

564
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:53,747
She's funny too.
A complete package, you know.

565
00:33:53,915 --> 00:33:56,406
When I need extra money,
I work construction.

566
00:33:56,584 --> 00:33:59,018
Well, it sounds very manly.
Do you wear a hardhat?

567
00:33:59,587 --> 00:34:02,488
Sarah was the one who always had
the boys knocking at the door.

568
00:34:02,657 --> 00:34:05,285
- Oh, Dad.
- She had eyes only for that singer.

569
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:08,327
What was his name? Thin fellow.

570
00:34:08,663 --> 00:34:10,654
- Looked like a girl.
- Mick Jagger.

571
00:34:10,832 --> 00:34:14,495
No, no. Sarah was saving herself
for David cassidy.

572
00:34:14,669 --> 00:34:15,897
Like you weren't.

573
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:19,506
- Carol wasn't saving herself for anybody.
- What?

574
00:34:20,041 --> 00:34:23,340
I remember now. It was David cassidy
of <i>The Pheasant Family</i>.

575
00:34:23,511 --> 00:34:25,035
Bill. Bill, honey.

576
00:34:25,213 --> 00:34:28,341
<i>Partridge Family</i>. You know,
I saw him last year in Vegas.

577
00:34:28,549 --> 00:34:31,143
He was good. Hadn't changed a bit.
Same turtleneck.

578
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:33,753
Sarah had the whole
Partridge act down.

579
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:36,422
She'd put on the little miniskirt,
the go-go boots...

580
00:34:36,624 --> 00:34:38,182
...and pretend she was Susan Dey.

581
00:34:38,392 --> 00:34:41,361
- This is all a lie.
- Sing the theme song, Sarah.

582
00:34:41,662 --> 00:34:45,428
- Don't make me kill you, carol.
- You remember the intro.

583
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:55,570
- No.
- Come on.

584
00:34:55,743 --> 00:34:56,869
Come on.

585
00:35:44,959 --> 00:35:46,927
Oh, that was what he told you.

586
00:35:47,128 --> 00:35:48,993
- It was a great night.
- Great night.

587
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:52,563
I forgot how much fun those
humiliating family sing-alongs can be.

588
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:55,031
Can I say one thing
about Mr. Incorrigible?

589
00:35:55,203 --> 00:35:59,139
- Only if you sing it.
- He is hot. And he likes you.

590
00:35:59,307 --> 00:36:02,470
I can't. It's just my luck.
He's the father of one of my students.

591
00:36:02,677 --> 00:36:07,137
He has a Ph.D. And a great ass.
Let's not get dragged down by ethics.

592
00:36:07,315 --> 00:36:09,283
Technically, he doesn't have
his Ph.D. Yet.

593
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:12,749
- But yes, the ass thing, I know.
- God, let's not even mention the eyes.

594
00:36:12,987 --> 00:36:15,922
- The crinkly smile.
- No. That would be wrong.

595
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:18,255
- So can I ask you a question?
- No.

596
00:36:18,826 --> 00:36:22,057
You never would have left Kevin.
Would you?

597
00:36:22,330 --> 00:36:25,959
If he hadn't left me?
No, I don't think so.

598
00:36:26,133 --> 00:36:28,795
But you weren't really happy.

599
00:36:28,970 --> 00:36:33,100
Well, I figured that was the life I picked,
so I had to make the most of it.

600
00:36:33,307 --> 00:36:35,605
I'm not even sure
I deserve a new life now.

601
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:39,143
Sometimes I think that was supposed
to be my one chance and I blew it.

602
00:36:39,313 --> 00:36:42,407
Where did we get these bad attitudes,
you think?

603
00:36:42,783 --> 00:36:44,774
- The nuns?
- Yeah, that works.

604
00:36:45,019 --> 00:36:47,749
Let's blame the nuns.
Can I say one more thing?

605
00:36:49,891 --> 00:36:52,223
You love me. I know.

606
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:54,719
I do.

607
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:59,361
I mean, I was really bad.
She did not see my A game.

608
00:36:59,533 --> 00:37:01,660
Sounds like she didn't see
your B or c game.

609
00:37:01,836 --> 00:37:04,964
I'm gonna call her again.
I want to ask her out. I need a mulligan.

610
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:07,164
Dog threw me.
I mean, the sun was in my eyes.

611
00:37:07,375 --> 00:37:08,774
Pick someone else, start over.

612
00:37:08,943 --> 00:37:11,605
No, this girl, there's something
special about this girl.

613
00:37:11,779 --> 00:37:14,043
You know the expression
"she took my breath away"?

614
00:37:14,215 --> 00:37:18,379
I mean, she did. I actually gasped.
I'm off the bench, man.

615
00:37:18,753 --> 00:37:21,119
Think she'll see you again?
I wouldn't.

616
00:37:21,289 --> 00:37:24,281
You're not nice.
Like, you're not a nice person.

617
00:37:27,962 --> 00:37:29,224
- Hi, June.
- Hey, June.

618
00:37:29,397 --> 00:37:31,456
- Hi, June.
- Hey, June.

619
00:37:31,632 --> 00:37:34,567
Need more cupcakes.
All the dads are staying for the party.

620
00:37:34,735 --> 00:37:36,532
- What's up with that?
- I have no idea.

621
00:37:36,704 --> 00:37:38,797
Every Halloween it's the same thing.

622
00:37:38,973 --> 00:37:42,568
But I guess it's great how involved
they are in their kids' world. Isn't it?

623
00:37:42,777 --> 00:37:44,005
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

624
00:37:45,379 --> 00:37:46,903
Why don't you and Eric come over.

625
00:37:47,081 --> 00:37:50,676
I'll rent a hopelessly romantic movie.
We can all hold hands together and cry.

626
00:37:50,885 --> 00:37:52,716
Sounds fun, but we can't.

627
00:37:52,887 --> 00:37:55,822
It's our anniversary, and we always
spend it just the two of us.

628
00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:57,218
Sweet.

629
00:37:57,391 --> 00:37:59,791
Seven years ago tonight,
we met at my parents' house.

630
00:37:59,961 --> 00:38:02,759
They were trying to fix Eric up
with my sister.

631
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:08,034
Sorry we're late.

632
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:09,897
Austin drives so slow.

633
00:38:10,071 --> 00:38:12,335
I hope my family
wasn't embarrassing last night.

634
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:16,642
Oh, no. Not at all. They do seem
a little bit involved in your life.

635
00:38:16,811 --> 00:38:19,006
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

636
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:21,010
Austin's mom's from a large family.

637
00:38:21,182 --> 00:38:23,514
That's a lot of people
that don't speak to me.

638
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:27,342
- Thimbleful of juice?
- Sure. But just one.

639
00:38:27,788 --> 00:38:30,450
- To good teachers.
- To good dads.

640
00:38:30,624 --> 00:38:33,024
To good teachers
who are also very beautiful.

641
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:38,923
To good dads who
are dangerously cute and charming.

642
00:38:39,333 --> 00:38:41,426
There you go.

643
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:49,634
There's an attraction here, Sarah.
You can't deny it.

644
00:38:49,810 --> 00:38:52,335
- I'm not. I'm trying to ignore it.
- Why?

645
00:38:52,546 --> 00:38:55,310
Well, for one, Austin is my student.

646
00:38:55,516 --> 00:38:57,541
Two, we're in the puppet closet.

647
00:38:57,718 --> 00:39:01,745
- Couldn't we go out in the real world?
- I'm not so good in the real world.

648
00:39:02,056 --> 00:39:06,254
I was looking at the handbook,
under "dating, parents and teachers."

649
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:08,724
- Nothing. There's nothing there.
- Sarah.

650
00:39:09,263 --> 00:39:13,666
We need the emergency pants.
It's an emergency.

651
00:39:15,669 --> 00:39:18,900
Emergency pants.
Come on, sweetie.

652
00:39:28,516 --> 00:39:29,744
<i>Hey, babe, my name is Ron.</i>

653
00:39:29,917 --> 00:39:33,910
<i>Mid-40s, handsome, totally toned,</i>
<i>5'7", 161 pounds...</i>

654
00:39:34,088 --> 00:39:35,919
<i>... give or take a piece of pizza.</i>

655
00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:39,617
<i>No, I'm not kidding. I'm totally toned.</i>
<i>Call me, you won't be sorry.</i>

656
00:39:40,828 --> 00:39:42,819
<i>Hi, Sarah, it's Lennie.</i>

657
00:39:43,431 --> 00:39:46,798
<i>I had a wonderful time, and I'm...</i>

658
00:39:50,604 --> 00:39:52,299
<i>I'll call back.</i>

659
00:39:53,674 --> 00:39:57,337
<i>Hi, Sarah? It's Jake Anderson,</i>
<i>the idiot from the dog park.</i>

660
00:39:57,511 --> 00:40:00,275
<i>Actually, that was all a test</i>
<i>to see how you respond...</i>

661
00:40:00,448 --> 00:40:02,814
<i>... to crazy people, and you passed.</i>

662
00:40:02,983 --> 00:40:05,713
<i>So maybe we could see</i>
<i>each other again.</i>

663
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:08,480
<i>What do you say?</i>
<i>You want to give me another chance?</i>

664
00:40:17,531 --> 00:40:18,964
I had a couple of icebreakers.

665
00:40:19,133 --> 00:40:23,331
I even had a few stories for you,
anecdotes, but I forgot them all.

666
00:40:23,537 --> 00:40:26,563
- I think it might be that dress.
- My sister carol made me buy it.

667
00:40:26,941 --> 00:40:28,738
I love carol.

668
00:40:31,946 --> 00:40:34,437
- Well, this is a very charming place.
- Yeah.

669
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:37,014
- Good food?
- No, not particularly.

670
00:40:37,318 --> 00:40:38,751
But I like the ambiance.

671
00:40:38,953 --> 00:40:42,616
I come here because I know the owners,
the Parseghians, that couple over there.

672
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:45,020
- See? They're waving.
- They want us to join them.

673
00:40:45,192 --> 00:40:47,456
A few years ago, in a moment
of blazing clarity...

674
00:40:47,628 --> 00:40:49,926
...I forswore ethnic folk dancing, so...

675
00:40:50,097 --> 00:40:54,500
They'll come over and say hello
and maybe... How are you? Hi!

676
00:40:55,002 --> 00:40:57,937
- How are you?
- Hello.

677
00:41:00,641 --> 00:41:02,541
Nice, right?

678
00:41:02,743 --> 00:41:04,836
- Sarah, Mr. And Mrs. Parseghian.
- Hello.

679
00:41:05,012 --> 00:41:07,276
- Welcome, Sarah.
- Thank you.

680
00:41:16,023 --> 00:41:17,490
See you later. We'll drink.

681
00:41:17,658 --> 00:41:19,558
- Absolutely.
- Okay.

682
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:22,696
- You speak Armenian.
- A little bit.

683
00:41:22,930 --> 00:41:24,295
Well, what did you say?

684
00:41:24,465 --> 00:41:27,730
I asked him, "where is the youth hostel?"
It's all I remember.

685
00:41:28,035 --> 00:41:30,526
Kind of a joke we have.

686
00:41:30,771 --> 00:41:32,602
What is it that you do, exactly?

687
00:41:33,474 --> 00:41:35,203
God, no wonder I live alone.

688
00:41:36,310 --> 00:41:37,902
I build boats.

689
00:41:38,078 --> 00:41:40,478
You know, these handcrafted
wooden sculls...

690
00:41:40,714 --> 00:41:43,205
...rowing. The racing ones.
- Yeah. Really?

691
00:41:43,384 --> 00:41:45,249
Yeah. Yep.

692
00:41:45,419 --> 00:41:47,944
- Does anyone buy those?
- Nope. Not yet.

693
00:41:48,155 --> 00:41:50,487
Everybody wants all these high-tech...

694
00:41:50,958 --> 00:41:54,052
...fiberglass, you know, no turbulence.

695
00:41:54,295 --> 00:41:56,263
Where's the fun in that ride?
I don't know.

696
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:59,365
- But they'll come around.
- Don't count on me. I get seasick.

697
00:41:59,567 --> 00:42:00,829
- In the bathtub.
- Really?

698
00:42:01,001 --> 00:42:02,263
Yeah.

699
00:42:03,237 --> 00:42:05,899
You know what?
Can we just skip all the small talk?

700
00:42:06,407 --> 00:42:10,434
- What?
- Can we skip the small talk? Just skip it?

701
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:13,338
You know, like, who are you?
Who am I?

702
00:42:13,514 --> 00:42:14,981
What are we doing here together?

703
00:42:15,316 --> 00:42:17,841
I have this theory that
when you first meet somebody...

704
00:42:18,018 --> 00:42:20,646
...that's the time when
you have to be totally honest...

705
00:42:20,821 --> 00:42:22,482
...because you have nothing to lose.

706
00:42:22,656 --> 00:42:24,817
Five, 1 o years down the road,
gets a lot harder.

707
00:42:24,992 --> 00:42:27,552
You can't say one day,
"Happy anniversary, this is me."

708
00:42:27,728 --> 00:42:29,958
It doesn't work that way. This is it.

709
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:33,691
We'll never see each other as clearly
and as nakedly as we do in this moment.

710
00:42:33,867 --> 00:42:37,667
Right now. This instant. I'm really
scaring you right now, aren't I?

711
00:42:38,105 --> 00:42:40,335
Just a little bit. Yeah.

712
00:42:40,507 --> 00:42:42,771
But, you know, on the one hand...

713
00:42:42,943 --> 00:42:46,674
...you're very charming and interesting
and you have a lot of energy.

714
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:49,144
You know, on the other hand,
a little bit scary.

715
00:42:49,416 --> 00:42:50,644
Okay.

716
00:42:50,851 --> 00:42:52,978
Here's my story.
Here's what you need to know.

717
00:42:53,153 --> 00:42:54,677
Okay.

718
00:42:54,855 --> 00:42:57,346
I'm just divorced,
and I had my heart broken badly...

719
00:42:57,524 --> 00:43:00,015
...by a woman that I really loved.

720
00:43:01,562 --> 00:43:04,360
You know, but I think your heart
grows back bigger.

721
00:43:04,565 --> 00:43:07,329
You know? Once you've got
the shit beat out of you.

722
00:43:07,534 --> 00:43:10,469
And the universe lets
your heart expand that way.

723
00:43:10,638 --> 00:43:14,597
I think that's the function of all this pain
and heartache that we all go through.

724
00:43:14,808 --> 00:43:18,642
You gotta go through that to come out
to a better place. And that's how I see it.

725
00:43:19,913 --> 00:43:22,473
What about you? Why is
a dazzling woman like you single?

726
00:43:26,553 --> 00:43:28,521
You can do it.
You can just tell the truth.

727
00:43:28,689 --> 00:43:31,089
If you know the truth.
What have we got to lose?

728
00:43:31,258 --> 00:43:34,989
After the dinner we shake hands,
"good night," never see each other again.

729
00:43:35,496 --> 00:43:37,020
All right.

730
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:41,459
He stopped loving me.

731
00:43:42,136 --> 00:43:46,334
I don't know what I did
or what I didn't do.

732
00:43:46,774 --> 00:43:48,435
He just stopped.

733
00:43:53,781 --> 00:43:56,545
I don't think I've ever said
that out loud before.

734
00:44:02,356 --> 00:44:04,187
See, we just had
an honest moment.

735
00:44:04,358 --> 00:44:06,485
Now we can sit back
and enjoy our food...

736
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:08,457
...and get to know each other.
I'm Jake.

737
00:44:23,377 --> 00:44:25,140
- Condom?
- You don't have one?

738
00:44:25,346 --> 00:44:27,507
- Why would I have one?
- For occasions like this.

739
00:44:27,681 --> 00:44:29,876
There haven't been
any occasions like this.

740
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:32,552
- You didn't bring one?
- I didn't want to jinx it.

741
00:44:35,989 --> 00:44:38,617
This preschool of yours,
it's traditional? Developmental?

742
00:44:38,792 --> 00:44:41,158
- Montessori?
- Yeah, yeah. All that. Drugstore!

743
00:44:57,444 --> 00:44:59,537
There's a Rite Aid on 93rd.
Hang a left.

744
00:44:59,713 --> 00:45:01,908
- Should I take the freeway?
- Please turn left!

745
00:45:07,821 --> 00:45:11,757
- Is this the fastest you can go?
- I could go faster, but we'd lift off.

746
00:45:16,764 --> 00:45:18,664
- You drive.
- All right.

747
00:45:21,835 --> 00:45:24,269
For big ones, you need five,
six coats of varnish.

748
00:45:24,471 --> 00:45:26,905
For the singles,
it's a little bit different.

749
00:45:27,107 --> 00:45:29,041
There's one right there. Jackpot!

750
00:45:35,849 --> 00:45:37,510
They're out!

751
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:41,553
- How can they be out?
- I don't know.

752
00:45:42,055 --> 00:45:43,818
But I have a theory.

753
00:45:44,057 --> 00:45:46,685
Everybody in the whole city
is having sex...

754
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:49,795
...at the exact same moment
except us.

755
00:45:51,398 --> 00:45:52,729
But we will press on.

756
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:14,947
What's wrong?

757
00:46:17,891 --> 00:46:21,383
Well, the magic is gone a little.

758
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:23,794
Okay.

759
00:46:23,964 --> 00:46:25,932
- I mean, l...
- No, no, I understand totally.

760
00:46:26,099 --> 00:46:28,226
Look, you know.
There's other things we can do.

761
00:46:28,402 --> 00:46:31,667
I'd be happy just to stay with you
and look at you all night.

762
00:46:32,339 --> 00:46:35,035
Yeah, I haven't done this
in a while. And...

763
00:46:35,242 --> 00:46:37,301
- And now you don't want to.
- Yeah.

764
00:46:37,478 --> 00:46:38,672
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

765
00:46:39,012 --> 00:46:42,379
That's all right. If the magic's gone,
that implies there was once magic.

766
00:46:42,549 --> 00:46:44,073
Not bad for a first date.

767
00:46:44,251 --> 00:46:47,379
- Second date.
- Second date. This is great.

768
00:46:47,621 --> 00:46:49,612
- I had a great time.
- Me too.

769
00:46:50,791 --> 00:46:52,053
So...

770
00:46:52,659 --> 00:46:54,251
...good night.

771
00:46:59,132 --> 00:47:03,068
- You still have to drive me home, though.
- Right. Because you don't live here.

772
00:47:05,472 --> 00:47:07,167
Hello.

773
00:47:07,341 --> 00:47:11,209
Don't worry, it's just me. I'm in
the kitchen. Filled your freezer again.

774
00:47:11,445 --> 00:47:13,845
There's now enough meat
to feed every guy...

775
00:47:14,014 --> 00:47:16,414
...who answered your ad and still...

776
00:47:17,184 --> 00:47:20,278
- Jake Anderson, my sister carol.
- Hi.

777
00:47:20,721 --> 00:47:24,851
- Hi.
- Jake did, in fact, answer the ad.

778
00:47:25,025 --> 00:47:26,652
Do I get my meat?

779
00:47:29,196 --> 00:47:30,663
Thank you.

780
00:47:39,406 --> 00:47:41,772
Sorry to scare him away.

781
00:47:41,942 --> 00:47:45,139
It's okay. I think we both realized
it wasn't going to happen tonight.

782
00:47:45,312 --> 00:47:47,439
What's the matter? He's so cute.

783
00:47:47,614 --> 00:47:51,675
I don't know. We had a great night.
Laughing, really talking.

784
00:47:51,852 --> 00:47:54,446
You had a guy talking
and you let him escape?

785
00:47:54,621 --> 00:47:57,454
I'm not sure I actually understood
a lot of what he said.

786
00:47:57,691 --> 00:47:59,158
Doesn't matter. He spoke.

787
00:47:59,326 --> 00:48:01,954
And are we talking full sentences here
or just grunting?

788
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:04,859
He's quite emotional.
I know more about him than Kevin.

789
00:48:05,032 --> 00:48:08,229
An emotional man who likes to talk.

790
00:48:08,435 --> 00:48:11,871
- This is a mythical figure, Sarah.
- I don't think I'm ready for him.

791
00:48:12,039 --> 00:48:15,372
He's looking for the whole dance
and I'm just relearning the steps.

792
00:48:15,542 --> 00:48:19,273
What happened exactly?
Come on, tell me.

793
00:48:19,546 --> 00:48:21,138
- Leave nothing out.
- Okay.

794
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:23,749
We really connected
at the restaurant, like I said.

795
00:48:23,984 --> 00:48:27,681
But then, where do you go from there?
How much baba ganoush can you have?

796
00:48:28,055 --> 00:48:30,956
Then we started making out,
which was like being in 11 th grade.

797
00:48:31,191 --> 00:48:34,820
Then neither one of us had a condom,
which I think reflects some ambivalence.

798
00:48:34,995 --> 00:48:37,623
I'm just not cut out for this.
Life in the fast lane.

799
00:48:37,831 --> 00:48:40,857
Fast lane? You're not even
on the on-ramp.

800
00:48:41,034 --> 00:48:44,731
- But these people seem happy.
- Of course they do. They have a condom.

801
00:48:44,905 --> 00:48:47,840
Marc and I couldn't find a condom once.
Wanna know what we used?

802
00:48:48,041 --> 00:48:50,339
- No.
- Saran wrap.

803
00:48:50,644 --> 00:48:54,045
Thanks for that image which will
stay in my brain for the rest of my life.

804
00:48:54,214 --> 00:48:57,240
It was sexy in a <i>Good Housekeeping</i>
kind of way.

805
00:48:57,417 --> 00:49:00,147
I'll never be able to wrap
leftovers again.

806
00:49:00,487 --> 00:49:02,580
- Did it work?
- Maeve was born nine months...

807
00:49:02,756 --> 00:49:04,155
...and one day later.

808
00:49:06,727 --> 00:49:10,060
I don't wanna just do random dating,
carol. I wanna be in love.

809
00:49:10,230 --> 00:49:12,790
I wanna wake up next to someone
and see them smile.

810
00:49:13,133 --> 00:49:16,193
Do the whole Sunday breakfast thing,
go out and get the paper.

811
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:19,032
Stay in bed together all day.

812
00:49:19,539 --> 00:49:21,439
Wouldn't we all?

813
00:49:27,481 --> 00:49:32,316
Man, this is absolutely gorgeous. I love
this. I can't believe you built it yourself.

814
00:49:32,486 --> 00:49:34,420
Yeah, handcrafted. Hand-carved.

815
00:49:34,621 --> 00:49:36,885
I hope you'll find
that it's more than a boat.

816
00:49:37,057 --> 00:49:38,354
It's a time machine.

817
00:49:38,525 --> 00:49:40,925
- I love it. I want it. I'll take it.
- Great.

818
00:49:41,294 --> 00:49:42,921
Did you race a lot in college?

819
00:49:43,096 --> 00:49:46,224
I don't plan to race it.
Could you cut it in half for me?

820
00:49:46,967 --> 00:49:49,197
- Excuse me?
- Yeah, cut it in half lengthwise.

821
00:49:49,369 --> 00:49:51,963
I think it would be easier
to mount on the wall that way.

822
00:49:52,139 --> 00:49:53,538
You want to mount the boat?

823
00:49:53,707 --> 00:49:57,268
Yeah. I thought I'd put it in the den.
It'd look great above my big screen.

824
00:49:57,444 --> 00:50:01,107
You know, I think maybe you should go
to IKEA and buy a canoe.

825
00:50:01,515 --> 00:50:03,745
It's not for sale in that way.

826
00:50:04,017 --> 00:50:06,042
- He's kidding, right?
- Wouldn't that be nice.

827
00:50:06,219 --> 00:50:08,210
I've had this dream
that it'll end up wet.

828
00:50:08,388 --> 00:50:11,755
It's just not for sale in that way
at this time. Ever, really.

829
00:50:11,925 --> 00:50:14,792
Okay. Well, if you change your mind,
I really do want it.

830
00:50:14,961 --> 00:50:18,055
Yeah, if I change my personality,
I'll let you know what I become.

831
00:50:18,365 --> 00:50:20,731
- Okay.
- Thanks so much.

832
00:50:21,201 --> 00:50:22,998
- Nice guy.
- Stanley owes me a big favor.

833
00:50:23,170 --> 00:50:25,070
- It was a guaranteed sale.
- So what?

834
00:50:25,238 --> 00:50:27,365
Right. You can afford to be picky.
You sold...

835
00:50:27,541 --> 00:50:29,634
...let's see, no boats. No boats at all.

836
00:50:29,810 --> 00:50:32,745
You worry too much.
You really do.

837
00:50:32,913 --> 00:50:35,814
You're in a good mood.
That must have been some date.

838
00:50:35,982 --> 00:50:37,847
Charlie, you should have
seen this girl.

839
00:50:38,185 --> 00:50:41,951
She's shy, she's fragile,
she's self-conscious.

840
00:50:42,122 --> 00:50:47,025
She has no idea how beautiful she is.
She's a mess. It's fantastic.

841
00:50:47,694 --> 00:50:50,857
The evening didn't end up great,
but there were moments in there...

842
00:50:51,031 --> 00:50:53,397
...where we were completely
and utterly ourselves.

843
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:56,536
I was completely psychotic,
but she was completely lovely.

844
00:50:56,703 --> 00:50:59,695
Are you thinking about completely
closing the sale any time soon?

845
00:50:59,873 --> 00:51:02,273
I tell you about a night
with an unusual woman...

846
00:51:02,442 --> 00:51:04,603
...and you turn it
into a business transaction.

847
00:51:04,778 --> 00:51:06,507
We're not selling real estate here.

848
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:09,979
- And if we were selling real estate?
- We'd be in escrow this weekend.

849
00:51:19,659 --> 00:51:21,718
I see Dad's not alone.

850
00:51:21,895 --> 00:51:23,795
Never. Not our dad.

851
00:51:23,964 --> 00:51:26,455
I'm not calling any of them Mom,
I'll tell you that.

852
00:51:26,633 --> 00:51:30,535
- What is the new one's name again?
- I believe that is Marlene.

853
00:51:30,704 --> 00:51:32,865
There's a Linda,
but I don't think that's her.

854
00:51:33,039 --> 00:51:35,030
- That's Dorothy.
- Well, who knew.

855
00:51:35,208 --> 00:51:36,470
Hi there.

856
00:51:36,643 --> 00:51:38,975
Aunt Eileen.

857
00:51:39,846 --> 00:51:42,440
- You look wonderful.
- Thank you, dear.

858
00:51:42,616 --> 00:51:45,585
You look fine too, considering.

859
00:51:45,752 --> 00:51:50,189
We never liked Kevin.
We couldn't say anything, but we knew.

860
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:53,155
- That's so sweet.
- I hear you're not seeing anyone.

861
00:51:53,326 --> 00:51:58,889
Is that wise? With the clock ticking?
Because I have someone special for you.

862
00:51:59,065 --> 00:52:02,796
Casey Donovan.
Handsome, smart, single.

863
00:52:02,969 --> 00:52:04,561
- Aunt Eileen.
- Yes?

864
00:52:04,738 --> 00:52:06,535
He's my first cousin.

865
00:52:07,641 --> 00:52:10,371
This is a fine day for the Nolan family,
I tell you.

866
00:52:11,044 --> 00:52:12,477
For my son, Bill Jr.

867
00:52:16,216 --> 00:52:19,777
And young Ryan here,
the confirmation boy.

868
00:52:20,053 --> 00:52:22,954
And old Bill here.

869
00:52:26,226 --> 00:52:28,990
I'd like to do a poem, if I may.

870
00:52:29,396 --> 00:52:31,591
To commemorate the occasion.

871
00:52:31,765 --> 00:52:33,198
Who do you think he'll go with?

872
00:52:33,366 --> 00:52:34,594
- Tennyson.
- Browning.

873
00:52:34,768 --> 00:52:36,395
- Yeats.
- "Brown Penny."

874
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:38,834
By william Butler Yeats.

875
00:52:39,439 --> 00:52:41,304
Who knows her daddy?

876
00:52:41,541 --> 00:52:44,339
<i>I whispered, "I am too young"</i>

877
00:52:44,845 --> 00:52:48,337
<i>And then, "I am old enough"</i>

878
00:52:48,915 --> 00:52:53,818
<i>Wherefore I threw a penny</i>
<i>To find out if I might love.</i>

879
00:52:53,987 --> 00:52:59,619
<i>"Go and love, go and love, young man,</i>
<i>If the lady be young and fair. "</i>

880
00:52:59,926 --> 00:53:03,157
<i>Ah, penny, brown penny, brown penny</i>

881
00:53:03,797 --> 00:53:07,597
<i>I am looped in the loops of her hair.</i>

882
00:53:08,068 --> 00:53:10,434
<i>O love is the crooked thing</i>

883
00:53:11,204 --> 00:53:13,638
<i>There is nobody wise enough</i>

884
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:17,674
<i>To find out all that is in it</i>

885
00:53:18,879 --> 00:53:23,976
<i>For he would be thinking of love</i>
<i>Till the stars had run away</i>

886
00:53:24,284 --> 00:53:27,481
<i>And the shadows eaten the moon.</i>

887
00:53:28,388 --> 00:53:32,381
<i>Ah, penny, brown penny, brown penny</i>

888
00:53:32,959 --> 00:53:36,759
<i>One cannot begin it too soon.</i>

889
00:53:47,007 --> 00:53:49,771
- So good to see you, Aunt Eileen.
- It's always a pleasure.

890
00:53:49,943 --> 00:53:53,970
- Mother Teresa!
- Mother Teresa. No. Stop. Michael!

891
00:53:54,147 --> 00:53:56,479
It's okay. I don't mind.

892
00:53:57,150 --> 00:53:59,414
- She doesn't mind.
- That's not the point.

893
00:53:59,586 --> 00:54:03,818
She actually likes dogs. And me.
She just forgets.

894
00:54:04,190 --> 00:54:05,953
- Bye.
- Sarah. Darling.

895
00:54:06,126 --> 00:54:08,287
Some pressing business has come up...

896
00:54:08,461 --> 00:54:11,487
...and I was hoping you'd ferry
Dolly home for me.

897
00:54:12,899 --> 00:54:16,062
- Okay. Sure, Dad.
- I don't mind staying.

898
00:54:16,236 --> 00:54:18,830
You're a sweetheart. Both of you.

899
00:54:25,378 --> 00:54:27,869
So, what do you think
of my competition?

900
00:54:29,082 --> 00:54:31,778
I don't really wanna discuss
my father's...

901
00:54:31,952 --> 00:54:36,150
oh, it's okay. It's okay. I know.
A woman always knows.

902
00:54:37,157 --> 00:54:39,022
Not always.

903
00:54:41,194 --> 00:54:43,754
- Your guy go younger?
- Yeah.

904
00:54:43,930 --> 00:54:45,727
They always go younger, don't they?

905
00:54:46,433 --> 00:54:48,458
It does seem to trend that way,
doesn't it?

906
00:54:48,668 --> 00:54:51,967
When they're 8o, they want 6o.
When they're 6o, they want 4o.

907
00:54:52,138 --> 00:54:54,333
When they're 8o, they want 4o.
And they get it.

908
00:54:54,507 --> 00:54:56,065
Goddamn supply and demand.

909
00:54:56,242 --> 00:54:58,836
We ought to kill the guy
who thought that one up.

910
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:04,046
- So you didn't see it coming, huh?
- No, I thought we were happy.

911
00:55:04,217 --> 00:55:06,947
Maybe not "happy" happy,
but, you know, satisfied.

912
00:55:07,287 --> 00:55:09,847
I thought we were happy three times.

913
00:55:10,023 --> 00:55:11,786
Got a live one.

914
00:55:12,826 --> 00:55:14,987
You gotta come take a look at this.

915
00:55:15,228 --> 00:55:19,289
I love this Internet.
It's part fantasy, part community.

916
00:55:19,466 --> 00:55:21,525
And you get to pay your bills naked.

917
00:55:21,701 --> 00:55:23,931
They don't stress that enough
as a selling point.

918
00:55:24,104 --> 00:55:26,470
It's Jeremy in San Diego.

919
00:55:26,639 --> 00:55:29,608
He thinks I'm 16.
He inverted the numbers in my age.

920
00:55:29,776 --> 00:55:32,870
- I didn't have the heart to tell him.
- That would've been cruel.

921
00:55:33,046 --> 00:55:36,914
He comes to me for advice.
He thinks I'm very mature.

922
00:55:37,083 --> 00:55:38,812
We're pinned.

923
00:55:39,452 --> 00:55:41,818
- You're on this, aren't you?
- PerfectMatch. Com.

924
00:55:41,988 --> 00:55:43,956
- What, just one site?
- Yeah.

925
00:55:44,124 --> 00:55:46,615
Honey, you gotta put more bets
on the table.

926
00:55:46,793 --> 00:55:50,320
I'm on at least 1 o. You get to try out
different personalities.

927
00:55:50,497 --> 00:55:51,794
Like here. I say:

928
00:55:52,966 --> 00:55:57,460
"I'm into opera, antiques,
poetry in the original Greek."

929
00:55:58,171 --> 00:56:00,196
And on this one:

930
00:56:00,373 --> 00:56:04,605
"I like to skydive, ride motorcycles
and enjoy rodeo."

931
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:06,678
But you don't do any of those things.

932
00:56:06,846 --> 00:56:10,942
It's an ad. It's like those cars that say
they get 3o miles to the gallon.

933
00:56:11,117 --> 00:56:12,812
I mean, who knows.

934
00:56:13,253 --> 00:56:15,813
You just want someone
to take you out for a test drive.

935
00:56:15,989 --> 00:56:18,219
I'm not comfortable advertising myself
this way.

936
00:56:18,391 --> 00:56:22,760
Honey, when you get to be my age
and approaching your expiration date...

937
00:56:22,929 --> 00:56:26,956
...it pays to advertise.
This baby never sleeps.

938
00:56:27,133 --> 00:56:33,265
It's working for me 24 hours a day,
God bless its little Pentium-chip heart.

939
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:35,738
So tell me about your ex.

940
00:56:36,042 --> 00:56:39,170
Kevin. He's a fireman.

941
00:56:39,446 --> 00:56:41,812
And cute. Very, very cute.

942
00:56:42,015 --> 00:56:43,880
I have the calendars.

943
00:56:44,050 --> 00:56:47,144
We met when I was dating
all my brothers' friends.

944
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:50,380
My first two husbands were friends
of my brother Dave.

945
00:56:51,024 --> 00:56:54,790
Both of them bastards.
But then, so was my brother Dave.

946
00:56:55,795 --> 00:56:58,958
Things seemed to be going according
to plan with me and Kevin.

947
00:56:59,666 --> 00:57:03,568
We had our work, we got a house,
then it was time to have kids.

948
00:57:03,903 --> 00:57:05,302
But he was never ready.

949
00:57:05,472 --> 00:57:08,805
I was 34. Then 35, then 36.

950
00:57:09,109 --> 00:57:13,136
Then instead of children, Kevin decided
to have Veronica. Ronnie.

951
00:57:13,313 --> 00:57:16,111
Chatty as hell and 15 years younger.

952
00:57:16,483 --> 00:57:18,246
They got married two months ago.

953
00:57:21,554 --> 00:57:23,920
Did I mention that she's pregnant?

954
00:57:29,729 --> 00:57:31,492
Go get it.

955
00:57:34,968 --> 00:57:36,333
Hey.

956
00:57:38,605 --> 00:57:42,200
- What are you doing in the real world?
- Dogsitting. My brother and his wife...

957
00:57:42,375 --> 00:57:46,175
...are at marriage counseling. They don't
want her to know they're having trouble.

958
00:57:46,346 --> 00:57:47,677
You're a dog guy.

959
00:57:47,847 --> 00:57:51,339
You kidding me? I'm half Labrador.
Throw that ball. See who gets it.

960
00:57:52,452 --> 00:57:54,579
- I found him. I found the one I want!
- Austin.

961
00:57:54,754 --> 00:57:56,551
- I found my puppy!
- You did?

962
00:57:56,723 --> 00:57:59,123
- I'm getting a puppy!
- You are? That's amazing!

963
00:57:59,292 --> 00:58:01,419
- It's so exciting!
- I'm so happy for you.

964
00:58:01,594 --> 00:58:05,189
- Let's go get him!
- We'll be right behind you, bubba.

965
00:58:06,833 --> 00:58:09,825
- Thought it'd be good for him.
- Great idea. Yeah.

966
00:58:10,003 --> 00:58:12,471
I was gonna ask you
if you thought he was too young.

967
00:58:12,639 --> 00:58:15,005
- But it's a good age, right?
- I think so. Yes.

968
00:58:15,175 --> 00:58:17,040
- A boy needs a dog, right?
- Absolutely.

969
00:58:17,210 --> 00:58:20,202
Who else is gonna eat
his vegetables for him?

970
00:58:21,147 --> 00:58:25,174
I can't tell you what it means to me
that Austin's so happy in school.

971
00:58:25,485 --> 00:58:27,783
He's just lucky to have you in his life.

972
00:58:27,954 --> 00:58:29,182
We both are.

973
00:58:29,355 --> 00:58:34,952
I found him, Dad. I found my puppy.
Come on in, he wants to kiss you!

974
00:58:36,763 --> 00:58:39,391
Oh, I think you're gonna need
a bigger trailer.

975
00:58:48,474 --> 00:58:50,965
- Hello?
- So I know our dates aren't beginning...

976
00:58:51,144 --> 00:58:53,840
...or ending well,
but I find the middle intriguing.

977
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:57,572
- Well, it's not dull, is it?
- That's a good thing, right?

978
00:58:58,051 --> 00:59:01,578
So, what do you say?
You want to get together?

979
00:59:01,754 --> 00:59:04,621
You really want to give it
one more shot with me? Why?

980
00:59:04,791 --> 00:59:08,056
Are you kidding me? You're this whole
new style, this whole new system.

981
00:59:08,228 --> 00:59:09,786
Vivid grammar of eroticism.

982
00:59:09,963 --> 00:59:13,524
<i>A completely unique constellation</i>
<i>of attributes. My Halley's comet.</i>

983
00:59:13,700 --> 00:59:15,133
Do you write this stuff down?

984
00:59:15,301 --> 00:59:17,292
No, that actually came out
of my head.

985
00:59:17,937 --> 00:59:19,097
Sometimes I use notes.

986
00:59:20,573 --> 00:59:22,973
Hold on. Someone's at the door.

987
00:59:24,544 --> 00:59:27,672
- Dolly, what a surprise.
- I'm in trouble, Sarah. I need help.

988
00:59:29,015 --> 00:59:32,416
<i>Hello? Sarah, is everything okay? Sarah.</i>

989
00:59:32,585 --> 00:59:34,883
She can't talk now.
It's an emergency.

990
00:59:37,855 --> 00:59:40,153
It's Jeremy from San Diego. He's here.

991
00:59:44,662 --> 00:59:49,793
- I don't see why this is a problem.
- Well, for one thing, you are 17, and she's...

992
00:59:49,968 --> 00:59:52,163
- Forty-one.
- Yeah, but those are just numbers.

993
00:59:52,337 --> 00:59:54,362
Look at Justin Timberlake
and cameron Diaz.

994
00:59:54,539 --> 00:59:55,972
She's gotta be what, 1 oo?

995
00:59:56,140 --> 01:00:00,008
Oh, come on, Jeremy, be nice.
She's probably the same age as me.

996
01:00:00,578 --> 01:00:03,411
Some people go their whole lives
looking for their soul mate.

997
01:00:03,581 --> 01:00:05,913
And I found mine when I was 15.
Sue me.

998
01:00:06,084 --> 01:00:08,746
Fifteen? You said you were 17.

999
01:00:10,755 --> 01:00:13,849
- Dude, it is so not cool to lie to me.
- I'm sorry.

1000
01:00:14,025 --> 01:00:17,051
I didn't think you'd take me seriously
if you thought I was a kid.

1001
01:00:17,228 --> 01:00:19,253
Of course I take you seriously.

1002
01:00:19,430 --> 01:00:24,197
You're a wonderful boy, honey.
And we can always be friends.

1003
01:00:24,802 --> 01:00:27,828
But just friends. You know that.

1004
01:00:30,041 --> 01:00:33,568
- Okay.
- And there's something else.

1005
01:00:35,179 --> 01:00:36,908
I'm not really 41.

1006
01:00:39,183 --> 01:00:40,844
I'm 43.

1007
01:00:44,922 --> 01:00:46,822
Do your homework.

1008
01:00:55,633 --> 01:00:59,967
I couldn't bring myself to go over 5o.
It wouldn't have been fair to him.

1009
01:01:02,273 --> 01:01:04,298
- Good night.
- Night.

1010
01:01:04,942 --> 01:01:07,911
- Thank you, Sarah.
- Anytime.

1011
01:01:31,102 --> 01:01:32,569
Sarah. Hi.

1012
01:01:32,737 --> 01:01:35,399
I was in the trailer-hood.
I thought I might stop by.

1013
01:01:35,573 --> 01:01:36,972
Oh, good.

1014
01:01:37,141 --> 01:01:39,302
Sarah? Is that you?

1015
01:01:40,011 --> 01:01:42,571
- Sarah! Hi!
- June?

1016
01:01:42,747 --> 01:01:46,239
- I didn't know you were...
- No. This is good. We're all here.

1017
01:01:46,417 --> 01:01:47,850
We can have a conference.

1018
01:01:48,019 --> 01:01:52,683
Oh, I'll just go home now and go to bed
and maybe stay there forever.

1019
01:01:52,857 --> 01:01:55,917
Sarah has a friend
who lives practically next door.

1020
01:01:56,094 --> 01:01:58,927
That's cool. I love weird,
huge coincidences.

1021
01:01:59,530 --> 01:02:01,293
- Yeah.
- Sure you don't want to come in?

1022
01:02:01,466 --> 01:02:02,831
We opened a bottle of wine.

1023
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:06,629
Oh, I think I'd rather die,
but thank you. Yeah.

1024
01:02:22,854 --> 01:02:25,789
- Hi.
- Hey. Jennifer kicked us out.

1025
01:02:25,957 --> 01:02:28,448
- Both of us.
- Oh, Mikey.

1026
01:02:28,626 --> 01:02:30,924
God, I'm so sorry.

1027
01:02:31,529 --> 01:02:34,327
- She'll come around.
- I told him it's the holidays.

1028
01:02:34,499 --> 01:02:36,364
People are under a lot of stress.

1029
01:02:36,534 --> 01:02:38,502
I love this guy. I do. I love him.

1030
01:02:38,669 --> 01:02:40,500
- I love him.
- We've been talking.

1031
01:02:40,671 --> 01:02:42,536
We've been here a while.

1032
01:02:43,975 --> 01:02:45,738
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1033
01:02:45,977 --> 01:02:47,638
- Let's go.
- Come on, Mother Teresa.

1034
01:02:47,812 --> 01:02:51,373
- I hope it's okay that I stopped by.
- Oh, yes. Of course it is.

1035
01:02:51,549 --> 01:02:53,039
I'm so glad you did.

1036
01:02:53,217 --> 01:02:55,879
We were talking on the phone,
everything was going well...

1037
01:02:56,053 --> 01:02:59,784
...and then some strange woman said
"emergency" and hung up.

1038
01:02:59,957 --> 01:03:02,721
I called and no one answered,
so I was a little worried.

1039
01:03:02,894 --> 01:03:05,488
- I think it's very sweet, Jake.
- It's just a false alarm?

1040
01:03:05,663 --> 01:03:07,221
- Definitely a false alarm.
- Good.

1041
01:03:07,398 --> 01:03:10,834
No, my father's friend,
she got into a little bit of trouble...

1042
01:03:11,002 --> 01:03:14,130
...and I had to help her out,
and so I went over there for a while.

1043
01:03:14,305 --> 01:03:18,571
And after that
I just drove around a while.

1044
01:03:18,743 --> 01:03:21,041
Alone. I was alone. And...

1045
01:03:21,212 --> 01:03:23,180
- Yeah, alone by yourself, sure.
- Yeah.

1046
01:03:23,347 --> 01:03:25,338
Well, anyway, the reason
I stopped by...

1047
01:03:25,516 --> 01:03:27,746
...was I wanted to invite you out
on my boat.

1048
01:03:27,919 --> 01:03:30,319
- I don't think that's such a good idea.
- Yes, it is.

1049
01:03:30,488 --> 01:03:32,251
No, because I...

1050
01:03:33,090 --> 01:03:34,955
Boats are still on the water, right?

1051
01:03:35,126 --> 01:03:38,391
I hope so, otherwise I wasted
a lot of time designing the hull.

1052
01:03:38,996 --> 01:03:41,157
Yeah, actually, they're aquatic.

1053
01:03:41,332 --> 01:03:44,130
- Well, I don't even know how to row.
- I'll teach you.

1054
01:03:44,902 --> 01:03:48,929
- I'd love to teach you how to row.
- Okay. How?

1055
01:03:49,640 --> 01:03:51,301
A challenge.

1056
01:03:52,276 --> 01:03:54,744
- We'll have a lesson right now. Okay?
- Okay.

1057
01:03:54,912 --> 01:03:58,814
So the thing about rowing
is just you gotta relax, first of all.

1058
01:03:58,983 --> 01:04:03,181
And then it's all about rhythm,
balance...

1059
01:04:03,354 --> 01:04:04,981
- Rhythm and balance.
...and timing.

1060
01:04:05,156 --> 01:04:07,590
- Watch those oars, pal.
- Okay.

1061
01:04:07,959 --> 01:04:11,292
- And rhythm and timing, see?
- Balance and rhythm.

1062
01:04:11,462 --> 01:04:14,795
- See, it's not that bad, is it?
- No, I like rowing.

1063
01:04:14,966 --> 01:04:19,562
Then you want to make sure you get,
you know, your hair out of the way.

1064
01:04:25,509 --> 01:04:26,942
That's gotta hurt.

1065
01:04:28,012 --> 01:04:29,912
- Michael?
- You okay, pal?

1066
01:04:30,081 --> 01:04:32,743
Oh, no. Don't stop what you're doing.
I was on my way out.

1067
01:04:32,917 --> 01:04:34,214
Easy there, Tex.

1068
01:04:34,385 --> 01:04:36,876
- Where are you going?
- Oh, I just spoke to Jennifer.

1069
01:04:37,054 --> 01:04:39,784
Everything's great. I got the couch,
the dog's gonna stay.

1070
01:04:39,957 --> 01:04:42,425
You should stay here too.
You shouldn't be driving.

1071
01:04:42,593 --> 01:04:45,084
- I'll drive him home. Okay?
- Yeah.

1072
01:04:45,930 --> 01:04:48,763
I thought we were gonna,
you know, row the boat.

1073
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:53,167
We will. Just stay exactly here
and stay exactly you...

1074
01:04:53,337 --> 01:04:56,829
...and I'll be back in about 15
to 2o seconds depending on traffic.

1075
01:04:57,008 --> 01:05:00,000
Just hold that thought.
Where do you live?

1076
01:05:00,177 --> 01:05:04,580
Of course you realize when Jake
gets here, you'll have to excuse yourself.

1077
01:05:10,388 --> 01:05:13,653
Bob! Bobby. No, Bob.

1078
01:05:13,824 --> 01:05:16,759
- You dropped these on my driveway.
- Oh, thank you.

1079
01:05:16,928 --> 01:05:20,455
I'm really sorry. I'm sure
that seemed pretty awkward, huh?

1080
01:05:20,631 --> 01:05:22,565
No, no. Routine, really.

1081
01:05:22,733 --> 01:05:24,894
There's nothing going on
there with me and June.

1082
01:05:25,069 --> 01:05:27,970
They were late from the museum,
and I made her stay for dinner.

1083
01:05:28,139 --> 01:05:30,073
Well, thank you for bringing these...

1084
01:05:36,147 --> 01:05:39,173
- You're back.
- Yeah, he... He passed out.

1085
01:05:39,350 --> 01:05:41,716
He couldn't tell me where he lived.

1086
01:05:41,886 --> 01:05:46,152
- 321 something.
- Yeah, that was all I got.

1087
01:05:46,757 --> 01:05:50,193
- I'm Bob, by the way.
- Oh, my manners have completely left me.

1088
01:05:50,361 --> 01:05:53,194
- I'm so sorry. Jake Anderson.
- How you doing?

1089
01:05:53,364 --> 01:05:56,128
- My brother Michael.
- Oh, sorry. Here you go.

1090
01:05:56,300 --> 01:05:57,767
Pleasure to meet you.

1091
01:05:57,935 --> 01:06:00,495
This is Bob connor,
parent at the school.

1092
01:06:01,372 --> 01:06:04,705
We were just... what were we?

1093
01:06:04,875 --> 01:06:08,504
Sarah left stuff at my place tonight,
thought it'd be better to get it back.

1094
01:06:08,679 --> 01:06:10,146
I'll get out of the way.

1095
01:06:10,514 --> 01:06:12,744
- Talk to you tomorrow, Sarah. Okay?
- Okay.

1096
01:06:13,150 --> 01:06:16,313
- Nice to meet you guys.
- Pleasure.

1097
01:06:18,723 --> 01:06:22,489
Hey, I better get going.
Where do you want me to put him?

1098
01:06:22,660 --> 01:06:24,560
- Maybe I'll put him here.
- No, you don't...

1099
01:06:24,729 --> 01:06:26,253
we're sitting down now, buddy.

1100
01:06:28,265 --> 01:06:29,596
Yeah, I...

1101
01:06:29,767 --> 01:06:32,736
- I better get going.
- You don't have to go. You could stay. Sit.

1102
01:06:34,305 --> 01:06:37,035
No, no, no. Really, I should go.

1103
01:06:41,245 --> 01:06:43,543
Jake. Jake, please let me explain.

1104
01:06:43,714 --> 01:06:45,181
- You don't have to.
- I want to.

1105
01:06:45,349 --> 01:06:46,714
I don't have any claim on you.

1106
01:06:46,884 --> 01:06:49,648
We've seen each other what,
four times now? I realize that.

1107
01:06:49,820 --> 01:06:51,253
You won't let me explain?

1108
01:06:51,422 --> 01:06:55,552
Let me do it. You were lying because you
didn't want to hurt my feelings. I get it.

1109
01:07:12,276 --> 01:07:14,574
<i>If dogs are to prove their worth</i>
<i>as rescuers...</i>

1110
01:07:14,745 --> 01:07:18,374
<i>... they must overcome their fears.</i>
<i>Again, Mass goes first.</i>

1111
01:07:18,549 --> 01:07:22,986
<i>She's accustomed to the deafening noise</i>
<i>and turbulent winds of the helicopter.</i>

1112
01:07:23,154 --> 01:07:26,385
<i>She's made these jumps</i>
<i>dozens of times before.</i>

1113
01:07:26,557 --> 01:07:29,253
<i>But the big question is,</i>
<i>how will the rookies perform?</i>

1114
01:07:29,427 --> 01:07:31,554
You could do this. You could.

1115
01:07:31,729 --> 01:07:34,027
<i>They hesitate at the open door.</i>

1116
01:07:43,908 --> 01:07:45,603
Hey, I'm gonna head out.

1117
01:07:45,776 --> 01:07:50,042
- You forgot to take your headdress off.
- No, I didn't. Any plans for the holiday?

1118
01:07:50,214 --> 01:07:52,444
Dad's house, a thousand relatives.
How about you?

1119
01:07:52,950 --> 01:07:56,351
- Eric's parents are back in town.
- Now they're starting to piss me off.

1120
01:07:56,520 --> 01:08:00,547
- Oh, honey, if you need to cry, call me.
- Got you on speed dial.

1121
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:05,121
Are we okay?

1122
01:08:05,296 --> 01:08:06,991
Sure. Why wouldn't we be?

1123
01:08:07,164 --> 01:08:10,190
I had no idea you and Bobby were...

1124
01:08:10,367 --> 01:08:12,835
oh, we're nothing, June. Me and Bobby.

1125
01:08:13,003 --> 01:08:15,198
Well, we're not either. Me and him.

1126
01:08:15,539 --> 01:08:19,441
But he is one hot dad, though.
I so don't blame you for being interested.

1127
01:08:19,610 --> 01:08:21,168
"Interested" may be pushing it.

1128
01:08:21,345 --> 01:08:25,782
Well, I'm not in that picture.
I just want you to know.

1129
01:08:30,955 --> 01:08:34,789
I love Thanksgiving.
I'm so glad I'm not cooking.

1130
01:08:35,993 --> 01:08:37,483
Watch your back.

1131
01:08:38,796 --> 01:08:44,291
Now, before we tackle
this succulent-looking bird...

1132
01:08:44,468 --> 01:08:46,936
...we have some honored guests
with us today.

1133
01:08:47,571 --> 01:08:50,540
Marlene Swift. Dorothy Murphy.

1134
01:08:50,708 --> 01:08:52,699
And Dolly Mccann.

1135
01:08:52,877 --> 01:08:54,606
Hello, Dolly.

1136
01:08:55,079 --> 01:08:56,273
- Hi.
- Hey.

1137
01:08:58,282 --> 01:09:00,614
All three at the same table.

1138
01:09:03,654 --> 01:09:06,145
The man has balls of steel.

1139
01:09:06,323 --> 01:09:08,052
We're very proud.

1140
01:09:13,898 --> 01:09:17,026
This was a great idea. It's the perfect
place to spend Thanksgiving.

1141
01:09:17,201 --> 01:09:19,795
- I'm just sorry my parents aren't here.
- Next year.

1142
01:09:20,171 --> 01:09:22,162
You're not afraid
that'd be too sentimental?

1143
01:09:22,339 --> 01:09:24,534
No. It's old family tradition.

1144
01:09:24,708 --> 01:09:28,269
- They have a great Sunday brunch here too.
- Did I tell you she was a teacher?

1145
01:09:28,445 --> 01:09:30,640
Preschool. Works with kids.

1146
01:09:30,814 --> 01:09:33,783
- Tiny, tiny little kids. You want kids?
- Oh, yeah. I love kids.

1147
01:09:33,951 --> 01:09:36,317
Want that white picket fence,
the whole deal.

1148
01:09:36,487 --> 01:09:39,183
She might've been the one. She's good.
She was interesting.

1149
01:09:39,356 --> 01:09:40,823
I caught a glimpse. Something.

1150
01:09:40,991 --> 01:09:43,892
You gotta stop obsessing
about the dog-park girl, Jake.

1151
01:09:44,061 --> 01:09:45,187
- I know.
- Move on.

1152
01:09:45,362 --> 01:09:46,420
I will.

1153
01:09:46,597 --> 01:09:49,794
This time you got written
out of Act 1. women are devious.

1154
01:09:49,967 --> 01:09:51,832
Self-serving, shallow.

1155
01:09:54,104 --> 01:09:55,731
Not you, dear.

1156
01:09:59,677 --> 01:10:02,237
Okay. If casey Donovan's no good...

1157
01:10:02,413 --> 01:10:06,611
"lf"? What do you mean, "if"?
His mother and my mother were sisters.

1158
01:10:06,951 --> 01:10:09,715
- Ron Detmer?
- He's my optometrist.

1159
01:10:09,887 --> 01:10:11,445
He's expecting your call.

1160
01:10:11,622 --> 01:10:14,523
How many fingers am I holding up?

1161
01:10:16,927 --> 01:10:20,021
Sarah, great news.
I didn't want to get your hopes up.

1162
01:10:20,197 --> 01:10:22,995
But two guys in my office
just got divorced.

1163
01:10:23,167 --> 01:10:25,328
- So much to be thankful for.
- Start with Richie.

1164
01:10:25,502 --> 01:10:27,231
If that doesn't work, go with Jerry.

1165
01:10:27,404 --> 01:10:30,669
- Richie first. Got it.
- Yeah, definitely go with Richie.

1166
01:10:35,512 --> 01:10:40,074
Better watch yourself. With those girls,
cleaning is a contact sport.

1167
01:10:44,488 --> 01:10:48,549
He's worth it, you know, your dad.
Despite all his shenanigans.

1168
01:10:49,126 --> 01:10:51,185
Besides, I'm having as much fun
as he is.

1169
01:10:51,729 --> 01:10:52,923
Why don't I believe you?

1170
01:10:53,097 --> 01:10:58,592
Look, you care about someone, they're in
a lot of pain, you cut them some slack.

1171
01:10:59,003 --> 01:11:02,370
I just thank God
he doesn't have a bigger table.

1172
01:11:06,810 --> 01:11:08,641
Hello.

1173
01:11:15,152 --> 01:11:17,746
One raised eyebrow.
Never a good sign.

1174
01:11:18,055 --> 01:11:19,955
How do you remember
all their names, Dad?

1175
01:11:20,124 --> 01:11:22,649
Let alone birthdays
and religious affiliations?

1176
01:11:22,826 --> 01:11:27,490
- I have it all on a disk. That way...
- I really don't want to know.

1177
01:11:29,066 --> 01:11:31,830
You're in different leagues, Dad.
You and Dolly.

1178
01:11:32,036 --> 01:11:33,901
I think she's starting
to fall for you.

1179
01:11:34,071 --> 01:11:36,198
- Well, I'm sorry if...
- No, you're not.

1180
01:11:36,373 --> 01:11:39,399
Because being a man today means
never having to say you're sorry.

1181
01:11:39,576 --> 01:11:41,567
I resent how easy this all is for you.

1182
01:11:41,745 --> 01:11:44,373
You've got women coming and going,
cooking, cleaning.

1183
01:11:44,548 --> 01:11:47,381
They're probably tuning up your car
for all I know.

1184
01:11:47,551 --> 01:11:51,214
All that matters to you guys is the tushies
are tight and the bellies are flat.

1185
01:11:51,388 --> 01:11:54,016
Meanwhile, caring, interesting,
compassionate women...

1186
01:11:54,191 --> 01:11:55,954
...of a certain age sit home alone...

1187
01:11:56,126 --> 01:12:00,085
...reading Jane Austen, eating ice cream,
which makes them less likely to find...

1188
01:12:00,264 --> 01:12:04,030
Are we still talking about me?
Because I can't tell anymore.

1189
01:12:05,302 --> 01:12:07,429
No, I'm sorry, Dad. I can't either.

1190
01:12:07,905 --> 01:12:09,395
It's all right.

1191
01:12:09,573 --> 01:12:11,905
I just don't want to see Dolly get hurt.

1192
01:12:12,242 --> 01:12:14,233
I don't either.

1193
01:12:14,712 --> 01:12:16,373
But it's different for me.

1194
01:12:18,248 --> 01:12:20,580
I've had the love of my life.

1195
01:12:21,352 --> 01:12:24,048
And no one else
could ever touch that.

1196
01:12:24,421 --> 01:12:26,446
No one can come close.

1197
01:12:29,159 --> 01:12:31,423
So I'm just out there...

1198
01:12:31,595 --> 01:12:32,789
...passing the time.

1199
01:12:32,963 --> 01:12:36,490
Tap-dancing, if you want the truth.

1200
01:12:38,035 --> 01:12:40,435
Maybe if I dance fast enough...

1201
01:12:41,672 --> 01:12:44,232
...I won't remember what I've lost.

1202
01:12:45,075 --> 01:12:46,667
You see?

1203
01:12:58,689 --> 01:13:00,554
I'll be right there.

1204
01:13:01,558 --> 01:13:02,650
Hi, can l...?

1205
01:13:04,061 --> 01:13:06,120
Look who's here. It's you.

1206
01:13:06,296 --> 01:13:07,854
Yes, your worst nightmare.

1207
01:13:08,031 --> 01:13:11,489
- The single-chicken-breast lady.
- You wanna at least hear the specials?

1208
01:13:12,236 --> 01:13:14,534
I'm supposed to tell them to you,
that's all.

1209
01:13:14,705 --> 01:13:16,332
Just the chicken breast.

1210
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:19,165
It's rough out there, huh?
You wanna talk about it?

1211
01:13:19,343 --> 01:13:21,140
You know, you're not a bartender.

1212
01:13:21,712 --> 01:13:24,112
Have you tried the Internet?
I mean, it really works.

1213
01:13:24,281 --> 01:13:28,945
- You know, I met my wife online, and she...
- chicken. Now.

1214
01:14:05,289 --> 01:14:07,189
Why not?

1215
01:14:10,394 --> 01:14:13,420
And I've been to Italy a lot too.
I just got back from Rome...

1216
01:14:13,597 --> 01:14:18,227
...where I took this fabulous in-depth
tour called "As the Romans Do."

1217
01:14:18,402 --> 01:14:22,532
- The guide was incredible.
- I took that tour. Big fat guy, right?

1218
01:14:22,706 --> 01:14:25,072
Before that, Switzerland.
I got caught in a storm.

1219
01:14:25,242 --> 01:14:28,678
- I almost died in a blizzard once.
- I lived up in the Alps for a year.

1220
01:14:28,846 --> 01:14:31,110
They had to cut me out
of the snow with scissors.

1221
01:14:31,281 --> 01:14:35,274
My aunt had a farm. In the morning, we'd
warm ourselves with the coals of the fire.

1222
01:14:35,452 --> 01:14:37,943
I learned to make goat cheese.
It was very <i>Heidi</i>.

1223
01:14:43,861 --> 01:14:48,093
Well, I just think it's wonderful how much
you care about your children, Peter. Really.

1224
01:14:48,265 --> 01:14:51,029
It's not always the case.
I'm a teacher, I know.

1225
01:14:51,201 --> 01:14:54,534
Well, it's just my daughter. She's 14.

1226
01:14:54,905 --> 01:14:57,100
But she's everything to me.

1227
01:15:10,787 --> 01:15:13,620
- Were you surprised that I called?
- Little bit.

1228
01:15:13,790 --> 01:15:15,314
But happy.

1229
01:15:15,859 --> 01:15:17,952
Well, I figured what the hell.

1230
01:15:18,128 --> 01:15:21,461
It's time to take control of my life.
New Sarah.

1231
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:27,364
- I liked the old Sarah, you know.
- New and improved.

1232
01:16:20,123 --> 01:16:21,750
- Good morning.
- Hi.

1233
01:16:21,925 --> 01:16:23,222
Hi.

1234
01:16:24,628 --> 01:16:28,860
- What time is it?
- It's a little after 9.

1235
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:31,427
Damn.

1236
01:16:34,571 --> 01:16:37,631
Do you mind if we take that and go?
I don't wanna run into traffic.

1237
01:16:37,808 --> 01:16:41,608
- Oh, it's Sunday.
- Yeah, I got a game today.

1238
01:16:46,249 --> 01:16:50,015
- You gonna eat that?
- No. Here.

1239
01:16:51,388 --> 01:16:52,912
Thank you.

1240
01:16:55,025 --> 01:16:57,016
You did sleep with June, didn't you?

1241
01:17:01,932 --> 01:17:04,059
Does it matter? Really?

1242
01:17:04,768 --> 01:17:06,793
It's just that you told me
nothing happened.

1243
01:17:06,970 --> 01:17:10,997
I knew we'd be great together, I didn't
want anything to get in the way of that.

1244
01:17:11,875 --> 01:17:13,570
And we were.

1245
01:17:15,879 --> 01:17:17,278
Yeah.

1246
01:17:31,895 --> 01:17:34,989
That was fun. Thanks a lot.
I'll call you.

1247
01:17:37,601 --> 01:17:40,434
- You mad at me?
- No, I'm not mad at you.

1248
01:17:40,604 --> 01:17:44,301
- Good, I was afraid something had...
- I'm mad at myself for trusting you.

1249
01:17:44,474 --> 01:17:46,635
For not listening
to that voice that said:

1250
01:17:46,810 --> 01:17:51,440
"He is a shallow, self-centered bastard."
Which is what you are, you stupidhead!

1251
01:17:52,049 --> 01:17:55,541
Maybe I have been teaching preschool
too long, but you took advantage of me.

1252
01:17:55,719 --> 01:17:59,314
You knew how vulnerable I was.
I was the weak impala of the herd.

1253
01:17:59,489 --> 01:18:02,947
And you pounced on that with that whole
sensitive dad-of-the-year act.

1254
01:18:03,126 --> 01:18:05,060
And, "we're adopting a puppy."

1255
01:18:05,228 --> 01:18:07,788
And the fake professor thing
with these fake glasses.

1256
01:18:07,964 --> 01:18:09,932
These aren't even real,
are they?

1257
01:18:12,602 --> 01:18:14,297
Sorry.

1258
01:18:15,105 --> 01:18:19,132
I just hate guys like you.
I hate guys like you!

1259
01:18:51,274 --> 01:18:53,333
But this is a good look for you, Sarah.

1260
01:18:53,510 --> 01:18:57,446
You've gone beyond pajamas
and are now wearing the bed.

1261
01:18:58,315 --> 01:19:01,716
Oh, God. I just went after
the wrong guy again. Like always.

1262
01:19:01,885 --> 01:19:04,877
I slept with a man
who's not my husband.

1263
01:19:05,355 --> 01:19:07,016
I'm promiscuous.

1264
01:19:07,257 --> 01:19:10,158
We should redo your profile
and put that in it.

1265
01:19:13,263 --> 01:19:16,960
Oh, God. I'm a complete
and total love failure.

1266
01:19:19,302 --> 01:19:22,738
- Oh, no.
- Stop it, it's not that funny.

1267
01:19:22,906 --> 01:19:24,373
Stop laughing.

1268
01:19:24,541 --> 01:19:27,704
What about that cute guy I met?
Condom man.

1269
01:19:27,878 --> 01:19:31,075
- Yes, that's how he likes to be known.
- Condom man?

1270
01:19:31,248 --> 01:19:35,116
- Sounds like a superhero.
- I can't.

1271
01:19:35,285 --> 01:19:38,880
He hates me. And I don't blame him.

1272
01:19:39,122 --> 01:19:42,114
No, I had my chance with him,
and I blew it.

1273
01:19:45,662 --> 01:19:47,721
Let's go watch <i>Beaches</i>.

1274
01:19:47,898 --> 01:19:49,798
Oh, my God.

1275
01:19:55,505 --> 01:19:58,531
When they remake this, they gotta
add a happy ending and nudity.

1276
01:19:58,708 --> 01:20:02,610
They won't remake it. Nobody wants
to watch this kind of yearning nowadays.

1277
01:20:02,779 --> 01:20:04,337
It's too painful.

1278
01:20:04,514 --> 01:20:06,880
- Modern man can't take it.
- This has gotta end.

1279
01:20:07,050 --> 01:20:08,915
There's a world beyond <i>Zhivago</i>- land.

1280
01:20:09,085 --> 01:20:11,280
Forget about the dog-park girl
and live again.

1281
01:20:11,688 --> 01:20:13,918
You think your friend still wants
to buy my boat?

1282
01:20:14,090 --> 01:20:16,024
Let him chop it up,
stick it on his wall.

1283
01:20:16,293 --> 01:20:19,626
- Call him.
- Seriously?

1284
01:20:19,963 --> 01:20:24,662
Tell him to come by the boat basin
this weekend. I'll row it down myself.

1285
01:20:25,368 --> 01:20:29,202
And call some of those insane,
pansexual girls you're so fond of.

1286
01:20:29,372 --> 01:20:32,432
I want a date every day
until christmas.

1287
01:20:36,513 --> 01:20:40,074
- Where have you been all my life?
- Waiting for you.

1288
01:20:45,622 --> 01:20:48,750
You are absolutely perfect.
You know that, don't you?

1289
01:20:48,925 --> 01:20:51,450
I do. But it's still nice to hear.

1290
01:20:51,995 --> 01:20:54,293
Hello, hello. Hi.

1291
01:20:54,831 --> 01:20:56,856
Look at you, cute jammies.

1292
01:20:57,033 --> 01:21:01,231
Already in them, a little early for that.
Come on, have a seat.

1293
01:21:01,805 --> 01:21:03,534
Eric, come on.

1294
01:21:04,140 --> 01:21:06,165
All right. Now...

1295
01:21:06,343 --> 01:21:09,403
...Eric and I are here to cheer you up,
and we have many options.

1296
01:21:09,579 --> 01:21:10,807
I'm ready.

1297
01:21:10,981 --> 01:21:14,747
First, there's line dancing at the Grove.
Very Southwest, mid-'8os.

1298
01:21:14,918 --> 01:21:17,011
- Too gay.
- Or...

1299
01:21:17,187 --> 01:21:20,623
...we can use these
teacher gift certificates...

1300
01:21:20,790 --> 01:21:23,520
...for midnight manicures.
- Perfect. Can we do that?

1301
01:21:23,894 --> 01:21:26,158
- That's not too gay?
- No.

1302
01:21:26,897 --> 01:21:28,922
He keeps the mystery alive,
doesn't he?

1303
01:21:32,535 --> 01:21:34,332
What color?

1304
01:21:34,638 --> 01:21:36,936
White. Caucasian.

1305
01:21:37,107 --> 01:21:39,769
What color nail? After wax.

1306
01:21:42,178 --> 01:21:45,477
- I don't know. What do you think?
- Your nail, not mine.

1307
01:21:45,782 --> 01:21:47,773
The light pink one. Yeah.

1308
01:21:48,852 --> 01:21:50,843
Not much love life, huh?

1309
01:21:51,588 --> 01:21:52,987
Not getting younger.

1310
01:21:57,527 --> 01:21:58,789
Did you hear that?

1311
01:21:58,962 --> 01:22:01,522
What is that? Why do I always get
the surly manicurist?

1312
01:22:01,698 --> 01:22:04,826
I don't know. Does a good job, right?

1313
01:22:05,535 --> 01:22:07,196
Oh, my God.

1314
01:22:11,041 --> 01:22:12,736
Oh, my God.

1315
01:22:15,211 --> 01:22:16,838
I'll be right back.

1316
01:22:22,519 --> 01:22:23,713
Jake!

1317
01:22:23,887 --> 01:22:26,185
- Jake!
- Sarah.

1318
01:22:26,356 --> 01:22:29,484
- Jake! Hi.
- Hi.

1319
01:22:29,659 --> 01:22:33,686
This is so weird, because I've been
thinking about you so much.

1320
01:22:33,863 --> 01:22:37,560
Nice to see you. Oh, you're all...
You look like...

1321
01:22:37,934 --> 01:22:40,528
I keep thinking about you.

1322
01:22:40,704 --> 01:22:44,037
What do they call those?
Pot sticker, with the potholders.

1323
01:22:44,975 --> 01:22:48,035
Hi. I'm ready, Jake.
Sorry I took so long.

1324
01:22:48,211 --> 01:22:50,236
Hi. I'm Sherry.

1325
01:22:50,413 --> 01:22:52,404
- Hi.
- This is Sarah.

1326
01:22:52,749 --> 01:22:55,411
- We just saw <i>Doctor Zhivago</i> at the Grand.
- Yeah.

1327
01:22:55,585 --> 01:22:59,180
- <i>Doctor Zhivago</i>.
- It's Jake's favorite movie.

1328
01:22:59,356 --> 01:23:02,951
- I didn't get it.
- Oh, I've seen it like 2o times.

1329
01:23:03,126 --> 01:23:04,150
- Really?
- Really?

1330
01:23:04,327 --> 01:23:07,592
- Yeah.
- Why? It's so depressing.

1331
01:23:07,764 --> 01:23:09,925
Everybody's freezing their asses off.

1332
01:23:10,100 --> 01:23:12,398
- They're communists, right?
- Yeah.

1333
01:23:12,635 --> 01:23:16,332
I guess I keep hoping that one time,
Lara and Yuri will get together again.

1334
01:23:16,506 --> 01:23:19,942
In the springtime, preferably.
And wear shorts.

1335
01:23:21,578 --> 01:23:23,944
Okay, but they can't,
because it's just a movie.

1336
01:23:26,216 --> 01:23:29,549
- It's a book too.
- Yeah, that's cruel.

1337
01:23:29,853 --> 01:23:31,343
Yeah.

1338
01:23:32,489 --> 01:23:33,922
Anyway...

1339
01:23:36,092 --> 01:23:38,356
Thanks for bringing that up.

1340
01:23:41,664 --> 01:23:44,292
Okay, I have to go get de-waxed.

1341
01:23:44,734 --> 01:23:47,032
Sarah, it was really nice
seeing you again.

1342
01:23:47,871 --> 01:23:51,602
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

1343
01:23:51,775 --> 01:23:53,834
Not again.

1344
01:23:54,144 --> 01:23:56,476
Yes. Thank...

1345
01:23:57,147 --> 01:23:59,172
Yeah. Bye.

1346
01:23:59,549 --> 01:24:03,508
- Do you want to be Russians tonight?
- Let's go.

1347
01:24:28,478 --> 01:24:30,673
Well, Sherry, I think I'm gonna say
good night.

1348
01:24:31,915 --> 01:24:34,076
- You're not coming in?
- No, I'm kind of tired.

1349
01:24:34,250 --> 01:24:37,344
- I'm gonna go home.
- Aren't we gonna do the Russian thing?

1350
01:24:40,557 --> 01:24:42,991
That's Russian for "no."

1351
01:24:43,159 --> 01:24:47,357
- Was it something that I did...?
- No, no, no. I'm just really tired.

1352
01:24:47,530 --> 01:24:50,988
- Tired. Yeah, it was a long movie.
- Really long.

1353
01:24:56,873 --> 01:24:58,306
Bye.

1354
01:25:02,112 --> 01:25:04,205
It seemed like it
was gonna be so perfect.

1355
01:25:04,380 --> 01:25:07,816
You chase him down the street,
he turns, he sees you...

1356
01:25:07,984 --> 01:25:10,976
...he takes you in his arms,
fireworks explode.

1357
01:25:11,721 --> 01:25:13,188
It's happily ever after.

1358
01:25:13,356 --> 01:25:16,120
You're leaving out the part
where he was with another woman.

1359
01:25:16,292 --> 01:25:17,520
I say you call him.

1360
01:25:17,694 --> 01:25:21,186
Or better yet, go over there, break into
his house, throw yourself at him...

1361
01:25:21,364 --> 01:25:23,832
...make a complete fool of yourself.
It worked for me.

1362
01:25:24,100 --> 01:25:28,036
- It was very effective.
- No, he's with someone else.

1363
01:25:28,371 --> 01:25:31,738
I have to face it, it's just not
gonna work out with us.

1364
01:25:32,175 --> 01:25:34,575
And you'd really like it to,
wouldn't you?

1365
01:25:37,080 --> 01:25:39,275
I can't take this.
This is breaking my heart.

1366
01:25:39,449 --> 01:25:42,384
Mine too.
But let's look on the bright side.

1367
01:25:42,552 --> 01:25:44,179
- Your nails look fabulous.
- They do.

1368
01:25:44,487 --> 01:25:46,717
They look so good. Let me see those.

1369
01:25:47,390 --> 01:25:49,449
- Look at these hands.
- Thank you, guys.

1370
01:25:55,965 --> 01:25:58,593
Turn around, this is your favorite part.

1371
01:26:01,671 --> 01:26:04,196
She's wearing that hat you like.

1372
01:26:12,382 --> 01:26:16,079
That's my side, thank you very much.

1373
01:26:17,120 --> 01:26:19,020
Mother Teresa.

1374
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:25,921
I love you too.

1375
01:26:43,213 --> 01:26:44,578
You like her?

1376
01:26:44,747 --> 01:26:46,647
- She's a handsome boat.
- Yeah.

1377
01:26:46,816 --> 01:26:49,216
Reminds one of the longboats
they would run...

1378
01:26:49,385 --> 01:26:51,945
...out of the sweet harbor at Bantry Bay.

1379
01:26:52,121 --> 01:26:56,455
Actually, I designed this one based
on a Portuguese boat.

1380
01:26:56,626 --> 01:26:58,423
But historically, you're correct, yeah.

1381
01:26:58,595 --> 01:27:00,790
- You built this boat yourself?
- Yes, sir.

1382
01:27:00,964 --> 01:27:02,693
- You build boats?
- No, no.

1383
01:27:02,865 --> 01:27:05,527
Truth be told, I don't know
the first thing about them.

1384
01:27:05,702 --> 01:27:08,728
- But I do appreciate a work of art.
- Well, thank you, sir.

1385
01:27:08,905 --> 01:27:12,841
I'm about to sell this work of art to a guy
who's gonna cut it in half...

1386
01:27:13,009 --> 01:27:14,840
...and stick it on his wall.
- Oh, no.

1387
01:27:15,011 --> 01:27:19,004
Yeah. I'm about to take her out for a last
paddle before I meet the butcher at noon.

1388
01:27:19,182 --> 01:27:20,877
Why would you do a thing like that?

1389
01:27:21,050 --> 01:27:24,451
It's a long story. Something about
the violation of expectations...

1390
01:27:24,621 --> 01:27:28,182
...and a crushing loss of faith
in love and life and art.

1391
01:27:28,358 --> 01:27:30,383
- So it's a girl.
- Yes.

1392
01:27:30,660 --> 01:27:33,458
I've had a little girl trouble
myself lately.

1393
01:27:33,630 --> 01:27:37,361
But better to have loved
and lost. Am I right?

1394
01:27:37,533 --> 01:27:40,161
She was a unique constellation
of attributes.

1395
01:27:40,336 --> 01:27:42,804
She was my Halley's comet.

1396
01:27:42,972 --> 01:27:45,532
But... Universe is designed
to break your heart, yes?

1397
01:27:45,708 --> 01:27:49,974
A philosopher as well as an artist.
Yes, it's we who suffer most.

1398
01:27:50,146 --> 01:27:53,843
Yes. With the possible exception
being the victims of violent crime.

1399
01:27:54,851 --> 01:27:59,220
- Well, it's been a pleasure to meet you, sir.
- No, no, pleasure's all mine. Jake.

1400
01:27:59,389 --> 01:28:02,017
- Bill. I have a daughter who would...
- No, no.

1401
01:28:02,191 --> 01:28:04,056
Never mind. No, no. Sorry.

1402
01:28:13,002 --> 01:28:15,232
Well, this is a surprise.

1403
01:28:15,405 --> 01:28:19,136
Can't a father pay a visit to his daughter
on a beautiful Sunday morning?

1404
01:28:19,309 --> 01:28:22,904
Carol called you, didn't she? She's afraid
I'm getting into my pajamas again.

1405
01:28:23,079 --> 01:28:26,742
Actually, carol called christine,
christine called Michael...

1406
01:28:26,916 --> 01:28:29,384
...Michael called me.
- Any word from Aunt Eileen?

1407
01:28:29,552 --> 01:28:32,612
She said to tell you that
casey Donovan was adopted.

1408
01:28:32,789 --> 01:28:34,347
If that helps.

1409
01:28:34,524 --> 01:28:37,459
Well, at this point, he's starting
to look awfully good.

1410
01:28:37,894 --> 01:28:39,919
He's out there, Sarah.

1411
01:28:41,197 --> 01:28:44,132
Someone who would appreciate
all you have to offer.

1412
01:28:46,002 --> 01:28:49,699
After all, you're this unique
constellation of attributes.

1413
01:28:49,872 --> 01:28:52,136
- You're Halley's comet...
- what did you just say?

1414
01:28:52,775 --> 01:28:55,175
It's a nice turn of phrase,
but it's not my own.

1415
01:28:55,345 --> 01:28:58,041
I heard it from a young man
I met this morning.

1416
01:28:58,214 --> 01:28:59,909
Builds beautiful Irish boats.

1417
01:29:00,516 --> 01:29:04,646
Poor lad. Had his heart broken
by a woman he deeply cared about.

1418
01:29:05,288 --> 01:29:06,778
Deeply.

1419
01:29:07,724 --> 01:29:11,216
- Jake. Jake!
- Hello there.

1420
01:29:11,394 --> 01:29:16,331
Hi. Hi, I'm looking for Jake.
Jake Anderson. Is he here?

1421
01:29:16,499 --> 01:29:19,798
- No, he isn't. But lucky for us, I am.
- I don't have time for this.

1422
01:29:19,969 --> 01:29:23,063
- Do you know where he is?
- You're "must love dogs," aren't you?

1423
01:29:23,239 --> 01:29:25,764
You've already crushed him,
he's been moping for weeks.

1424
01:29:25,942 --> 01:29:28,069
He's even given up
the whole wooden-boat thing.

1425
01:29:28,244 --> 01:29:30,109
- You've done enough.
- That's all wrong.

1426
01:29:30,279 --> 01:29:32,144
I have to talk to him. Where is he?

1427
01:29:32,348 --> 01:29:34,282
- I can't tell you that.
- Where is he?

1428
01:29:34,450 --> 01:29:36,247
I'm not telling you.

1429
01:29:37,653 --> 01:29:39,587
You know the bridge
by the boat ramp?

1430
01:29:48,264 --> 01:29:49,629
Jake?

1431
01:29:51,067 --> 01:29:52,625
Jake.

1432
01:29:53,403 --> 01:29:55,132
Jake!

1433
01:30:03,679 --> 01:30:07,240
- I'd like to rent a boat, please.
- I'm sorry, we're all out of boats.

1434
01:30:12,555 --> 01:30:15,490
- All right, come on.
- Oh, a love chase.

1435
01:30:15,658 --> 01:30:17,626
Come on, girl, you can do this.

1436
01:30:17,794 --> 01:30:21,230
This is really important to me.
Come on.

1437
01:30:21,697 --> 01:30:23,221
I think he could be the one.

1438
01:30:23,866 --> 01:30:25,333
Come on, girls, let's get going.

1439
01:30:25,701 --> 01:30:29,000
Push! Push!

1440
01:30:29,906 --> 01:30:33,069
Push! Push!

1441
01:30:33,242 --> 01:30:35,710
Push, push!

1442
01:30:35,878 --> 01:30:40,679
Push! Push! Push!

1443
01:30:40,983 --> 01:30:42,883
- Push!
- Push!

1444
01:30:43,052 --> 01:30:45,213
That's him. I see him!

1445
01:30:45,388 --> 01:30:48,357
Jake! Jake!

1446
01:30:51,727 --> 01:30:53,718
Stop the boat!

1447
01:30:54,063 --> 01:30:55,724
Never mind.

1448
01:30:59,669 --> 01:31:01,398
Okay, girl, here we go.

1449
01:31:01,571 --> 01:31:03,402
Jake!

1450
01:31:13,816 --> 01:31:15,841
Here she goes!

1451
01:31:20,356 --> 01:31:21,880
Jake.

1452
01:31:22,391 --> 01:31:24,188
What are you doing?

1453
01:31:25,394 --> 01:31:27,954
All right. Here we go.
All the way up. Almost.

1454
01:31:31,234 --> 01:31:32,531
- Come on, girl.
- Come on.

1455
01:31:32,702 --> 01:31:34,465
- Good girl, you can do it.
- Here we go.

1456
01:31:34,637 --> 01:31:36,662
- Watch your paws there.
- Easy, easy.

1457
01:31:41,878 --> 01:31:45,575
Cold. Cold. Very cold.

1458
01:31:47,984 --> 01:31:49,451
Here we go.

1459
01:31:51,754 --> 01:31:53,016
Thank you.

1460
01:31:54,757 --> 01:31:56,952
Was there something you wanted
to say to me?

1461
01:31:57,593 --> 01:31:59,117
Yes.

1462
01:31:59,295 --> 01:32:00,887
Could have just called.

1463
01:32:01,063 --> 01:32:03,896
Perhaps that would have been
the wiser course, yes.

1464
01:32:04,300 --> 01:32:05,892
What's up?

1465
01:32:07,069 --> 01:32:11,062
I owe you my story.
You asked me for honesty...

1466
01:32:11,240 --> 01:32:14,676
...and it scared the hell out of me,
and I held back...

1467
01:32:14,844 --> 01:32:17,404
...and I didn't want to let you
see the real me.

1468
01:32:17,580 --> 01:32:20,174
Because I was afraid
of getting hurt again.

1469
01:32:21,017 --> 01:32:25,420
But, listen, I hear that the universe
lets your heart expand...

1470
01:32:25,588 --> 01:32:29,217
...and grow back even bigger
after you go through all that pain.

1471
01:32:29,392 --> 01:32:32,793
Well, I believe that now.

1472
01:32:32,962 --> 01:32:35,988
And I was just wishing
there was a way that...

1473
01:32:36,198 --> 01:32:39,497
...I could have another chance
to make this work.

1474
01:32:49,579 --> 01:32:51,308
I'll be right with you.

1475
01:32:51,747 --> 01:32:53,977
Hi, how can l...?

1476
01:32:54,150 --> 01:32:55,447
Don't worry, I got it.

1477
01:32:55,618 --> 01:32:58,746
Single chicken breast, no dating advice,
coming right up.

1478
01:32:58,921 --> 01:33:01,822
Actually, I would like to have
three whole fryers, please.

1479
01:33:01,991 --> 01:33:05,017
And six pork chops and a lamb shank.

1480
01:33:05,194 --> 01:33:07,526
And do you have any dog bones
back there?

1481
01:33:09,031 --> 01:33:12,728
If you do, throw them in the cart.
What are the specials today?

1482
01:33:13,235 --> 01:33:14,361
Yes.

1483
01:33:25,715 --> 01:33:27,182
<i>Thank you.</i>

1484
01:33:31,821 --> 01:33:34,346
How many people
are actually in this family?

1485
01:33:37,393 --> 01:33:39,122
- Hey.
- Hey.

1486
01:33:39,295 --> 01:33:40,762
Get down.

1487
01:33:43,232 --> 01:33:44,529
Down!

1488
01:34:08,257 --> 01:34:09,918
How did we meet?

1489
01:34:10,092 --> 01:34:12,822
- Oh, that's a great story. Tell it, hon.
- Great story.

1490
01:34:12,995 --> 01:34:16,556
Well, actually,
it's a very romantic story.

1491
01:34:16,732 --> 01:34:18,791
- You tell it, carol.
- No, go ahead, honey.

1492
01:34:18,968 --> 01:34:22,199
No, no, really, you should.
She tells this story great.

1493
01:34:23,272 --> 01:34:25,001
You don't remember, do you?

1494
01:34:26,275 --> 01:34:29,301
Don't remember? How we met?

1495
01:34:35,851 --> 01:34:37,944
I don't remember.

1496
01:34:38,821 --> 01:34:40,914
But I love her.

1497
01:34:42,024 --> 01:34:43,252
I love her!

1498
01:34:43,426 --> 01:34:45,826
Love is not reserved for the young,
you know.

1499
01:34:46,162 --> 01:34:47,322
As the poet said:

1500
01:34:47,496 --> 01:34:50,158
<i>Grow old along with me!</i>
<i>The best is yet to be</i>

1501
01:34:50,332 --> 01:34:51,663
- Yeats?
- No.

1502
01:34:51,834 --> 01:34:54,029
- Tennyson?
- No.

1503
01:34:54,203 --> 01:34:56,433
- Browning.
- Browning.

1504
01:34:56,605 --> 01:34:58,368
Who knows her daddy?

1505
01:34:58,541 --> 01:35:02,568
Oh, my gosh, I did not think
I was ready to settle down...

1506
01:35:02,812 --> 01:35:05,406
...but look at the size of this rock.

1507
01:35:05,581 --> 01:35:09,347
And you want to know what else?
I'm gonna get a cute little tattoo...

1508
01:35:09,518 --> 01:35:12,078
...in someplace that's
N-o-N of your business.

1509
01:35:12,254 --> 01:35:15,451
And wanna know what it's gonna say?

1510
01:35:15,858 --> 01:35:18,759
"Mrs. Casey Donovan."

1511
01:35:21,030 --> 01:35:23,225
The best place to meet someone...

1512
01:35:23,399 --> 01:35:26,994
...is Parseghian's Armenian restaurant
in Koreatown.

1513
01:35:27,169 --> 01:35:29,501
I don't care if you're young,
you're old...

1514
01:35:29,672 --> 01:35:31,640
...you're single, you're divorced...

1515
01:35:32,975 --> 01:35:33,964
I'm getting there.

1516
01:35:35,411 --> 01:35:38,209
71 oo First Street.

1517
01:35:38,380 --> 01:35:41,178
Wednesday, mother-in-law night.

1518
01:35:41,350 --> 01:35:42,908
All she can eat.

1519
01:35:47,356 --> 01:35:49,722
- In a dog park.
- Dog park, yeah.

1520
01:35:50,059 --> 01:35:51,424
- It's true.
- I know.

1521
01:35:51,594 --> 01:35:53,118
I was very... I was nervous.

1522
01:35:53,295 --> 01:35:57,026
We had no idea at the time
that we could ever wind up...

1523
01:35:57,199 --> 01:35:58,723
oh, that's not true. I did.

1524
01:35:58,901 --> 01:36:00,425
- You did not.
- I did too.

1525
01:36:00,603 --> 01:36:03,163
- I have a theory about this.
- He has lots of theories.

1526
01:36:03,339 --> 01:36:05,739
I do. This is actually a good one.
I took some notes.

1527
01:36:05,908 --> 01:36:07,808
Oh, God, you're so prepared for this.

1528
01:36:08,010 --> 01:36:09,841
You grow up, you're an adult, right?

1529
01:36:10,012 --> 01:36:13,743
And you think you have all this worldly
experience, right? That's point A.

1530
01:36:13,916 --> 01:36:16,146
You think your personality is formed.

1531
01:36:16,385 --> 01:36:18,182
And then you think you're complete...

1532
01:36:18,354 --> 01:36:20,914
...but you meet somebody,
you start feeling new things.

1533
01:36:21,090 --> 01:36:23,490
And you start feeling
excruciatingly painful things.

1534
01:36:23,726 --> 01:36:27,355
You get confused, right?
You get nauseous.

1535
01:36:27,530 --> 01:36:31,762
And I think when you get really nauseous,
like that, it's, like, the completion of self.

1536
01:36:31,934 --> 01:36:34,630
The person who can fill the final void.

1537
01:36:34,837 --> 01:36:36,828
That's what it was like
when I met Sarah.

1538
01:36:37,006 --> 01:36:40,237
- I made you nauseous.
- In a good way. I was lovesick.

1539
01:36:41,844 --> 01:36:43,744
That was good, honey.

1540
01:37:54,083 --> 01:37:56,074
