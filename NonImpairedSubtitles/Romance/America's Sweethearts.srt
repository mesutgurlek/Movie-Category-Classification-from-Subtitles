1
00:00:41,182 --> 00:00:45,414
America first fell in love
with Eddie Thomas and Gwen Harrison...

2
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:50,580
...in the box-office smash
Autumn with Greg and Peg.

3
00:00:50,792 --> 00:00:54,421
They had the most celebrated
marriage in Hollywood.

4
00:00:55,897 --> 00:00:59,230
who could forget how they hit
one out of the park...

5
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:01,595
...in Requiem for an Outfielder?

6
00:01:01,803 --> 00:01:05,432
You can't die, Mike. You can't.

7
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,931
Because l love you.

8
00:01:11,746 --> 00:01:14,442
Justice never tasted so sweet...

9
00:01:14,716 --> 00:01:16,547
...as in The Bench.

10
00:01:17,919 --> 00:01:22,015
l didn't do it. l'm innocent.
Why won't anyone believe me?

11
00:01:22,223 --> 00:01:24,657
-l object!
-You're out of order!

12
00:01:24,859 --> 00:01:26,486
No, you're out of order!

13
00:01:26,694 --> 00:01:30,061
l object to the way my client
has been treated.

14
00:01:30,264 --> 00:01:33,563
l object that l've let
my professional judgment...

15
00:01:33,768 --> 00:01:36,532
...become clouded
by my feelings for her.

16
00:01:36,738 --> 00:01:40,640
l object to the way the room spins
when she walks in.

17
00:01:40,842 --> 00:01:44,801
l object, Your Honor,
because l love this woman.

18
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:47,274
Theirlove opened our eyes...

19
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:50,110
...in Sasha and the Optometrist.

20
00:01:50,351 --> 00:01:52,683
Read from the top line, Sasha.

21
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:57,121
''l...

22
00:01:57,592 --> 00:02:02,120
...L-O-V-E...

23
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,992
...Y-O--''

24
00:02:05,933 --> 00:02:07,161
Oh.

25
00:02:07,402 --> 00:02:08,664
You.

26
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:10,895
Dr. Martin!

27
00:02:11,105 --> 00:02:14,700
Eddie Thomas and Gwen Harrison:

28
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:18,001
America's sweethearts.

29
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:27,253
God, they were great.
Made my job cake.

30
00:02:27,455 --> 00:02:31,858
l did the press for all nine movies.
Six did over $1 00 million.

31
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:34,528
They were on top of the world.

32
00:02:34,729 --> 00:02:37,562
Then she blew it by dating
that Spaniard.

33
00:02:37,765 --> 00:02:40,427
-Did you cut this?
-No, Chad in marketing--

34
00:02:40,635 --> 00:02:44,332
Always take credit.
That is survival rule number one.

35
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:46,302
Okay, l did it on my Mac.

36
00:02:46,507 --> 00:02:51,206
Rule number two: Don't take credit
until someone says they like it.

37
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:52,808
lt's not bad.

38
00:02:55,683 --> 00:03:00,143
l hope this isn't too awkward for you.
l'll never fill your shoes.

39
00:03:00,354 --> 00:03:01,582
l know.

40
00:03:02,323 --> 00:03:07,659
Kingman's in the screening room.
He wants you to see something right away.

41
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:11,759
Please remind Mr. Kingman
that he fired me last week.

42
00:03:11,966 --> 00:03:15,197
And then invite him
to kiss my undercarriage.

43
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:17,769
You'll want to see this, Lee.

44
00:03:23,211 --> 00:03:25,645
-Hello, Dave.
-Lee.

45
00:03:25,913 --> 00:03:28,381
-Thanks for coming.
-Why am l here?

46
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:32,679
l'm just confused. You did fire me
last week, so why am l here?

47
00:03:32,887 --> 00:03:36,414
-To see the new Weidmann film.
-Really?

48
00:03:36,624 --> 00:03:39,115
Eddie and Gwen's last movie.

49
00:03:39,327 --> 00:03:41,955
You've seen it? All of it?
How is it?

50
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:44,389
Would you roll that, please?

51
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:49,036
Be the first to see what only
l have seen. As a friend.

52
00:04:15,663 --> 00:04:16,960
Something wrong?

53
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:19,293
Did the film break?

54
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:24,871
The film is fine. At least,
l think it's fine. Wherever it is.

55
00:04:25,072 --> 00:04:28,599
l spent 86 million dollars...

56
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,437
...of the studio's money...

57
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:32,613
...on 20 seconds...

58
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:34,873
...of titles.

59
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:38,477
That's all he sent. The titles!

60
00:04:39,687 --> 00:04:41,177
And a note.

61
00:04:43,157 --> 00:04:46,615
''Dave, we could also
do these in blue.''

62
00:04:48,429 --> 00:04:53,093
-We had to make a Weidmann film!
-He has three Oscars. He's a genius.

63
00:04:53,301 --> 00:04:56,964
There's only one genius
in the business: Señor Wences!

64
00:04:57,171 --> 00:05:00,971
Lipstick, hair and his hand!
He had an 85-year career!

65
00:05:01,242 --> 00:05:02,800
Do you remember? Huh?

66
00:05:03,077 --> 00:05:06,376
''All right?''
Don't talk to me about genius.

67
00:05:06,581 --> 00:05:09,641
-Remember the nut in the woods?
-Ted Kaczynski.

68
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:11,842
-The guy at Fox?
-The Unabomber.

69
00:05:12,053 --> 00:05:14,351
Remember he lived in that cabin?

70
00:05:14,555 --> 00:05:15,544
So?

71
00:05:15,756 --> 00:05:19,351
Hal Weidmann bought that cabin
from the government...

72
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:24,896
...and moved it onto his property.
That is where he edits his movies.

73
00:05:25,099 --> 00:05:28,330
That is his little, twisted...

74
00:05:28,603 --> 00:05:30,696
...sicko office.

75
00:05:30,938 --> 00:05:32,633
lt's him. On the phone.

76
00:05:33,975 --> 00:05:35,602
-Who?
-Hal.

77
00:05:35,977 --> 00:05:39,378
l'll kill him!
That sick son-of-a-bitch bastard.

78
00:05:39,947 --> 00:05:41,642
Put him on the speaker.

79
00:05:41,849 --> 00:05:42,907
Hi, Hal.

80
00:05:45,119 --> 00:05:46,552
How are you, darling?

81
00:05:46,754 --> 00:05:50,451
You're in my thoughts.
l want to send you a basket.

82
00:05:50,658 --> 00:05:51,647
How's the film?

83
00:05:51,859 --> 00:05:54,885
-Finding its way.
-Could it find its way here?

84
00:05:55,096 --> 00:05:58,190
We have a few things to do,
like finish it.

85
00:05:58,532 --> 00:06:00,022
lt's finished, Dave.

86
00:06:02,203 --> 00:06:04,068
Great. How is it?

87
00:06:04,272 --> 00:06:06,832
My mother thinks it's my best work.

88
00:06:07,141 --> 00:06:09,541
-Can l speak with her?
-No, Dave.

89
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:12,577
-Can someone pick it up?
-No, Dave.

90
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:17,615
-You haven't commented on the titles.
-l love them. l have no notes.

91
00:06:17,818 --> 00:06:21,948
-When's the press junket?
-Weekend of the 21 st. Why?

92
00:06:22,156 --> 00:06:24,454
l want the press to see it first.

93
00:06:24,825 --> 00:06:27,953
we'll experience it together
at thejunket.

94
00:06:28,162 --> 00:06:33,099
l'm the head of the studio. l don't
experience things with the press.

95
00:06:33,301 --> 00:06:35,735
-l'm hanging up now.
-Wait! Wait!

96
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:37,336
Give me that. Hello?

97
00:06:39,307 --> 00:06:40,569
God...

98
00:06:40,975 --> 00:06:41,964
...damn it!

99
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:53,250
-We can't see it before the press!
-At the junket?

100
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:54,716
At the junket!

101
00:06:58,626 --> 00:07:02,062
Lee, you have got to do
this junket for me.

102
00:07:02,263 --> 00:07:06,063
Set up a junket for a film
you're not sure you'll have?

103
00:07:06,267 --> 00:07:07,996
-Yes.
-No!

104
00:07:15,843 --> 00:07:17,504
Don't make me beg.

105
00:07:17,945 --> 00:07:20,004
-You already are.
-Lee, please.

106
00:07:20,214 --> 00:07:22,375
Please, come on. Lee?

107
00:07:23,918 --> 00:07:25,943
-Danny can handle it.
-No.

108
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:29,678
Danny cannot handle it.
lt's his first junket.

109
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:33,792
l need the master.
You're a legend at working the press.

110
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:38,625
-l want to stay a living legend.
-lf not for me, do it for my father.

111
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:41,859
You worked together a long time.
You bonded.

112
00:07:42,069 --> 00:07:45,004
-He was psychotic.
-You spoke at his funeral.

113
00:07:45,206 --> 00:07:49,575
-l loved him. You, l can't stand.
-Do this for me. Please.

114
00:07:49,777 --> 00:07:53,110
The studio's going under!
No hit in two years!

115
00:07:53,314 --> 00:07:57,978
lt may be the last Eddie and Gwen
movie, and l can't get my hands on it!

116
00:08:05,059 --> 00:08:08,028
What do you want?
l'll tell you what l want.

117
00:08:08,229 --> 00:08:12,791
lf people think Eddie and Gwen are
reunited, they'll see the film.

118
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,332
-Make it happen.
-That'll be easy.

119
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:17,936
Make it look like it could happen.

120
00:08:18,139 --> 00:08:21,108
She has a restraining order
against him.

121
00:08:21,308 --> 00:08:24,675
-He's in some mountaintop nut hut.
-l don't care!

122
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:29,680
l need Eddie and Gwen back
together again, smiling and happy!

123
00:08:30,084 --> 00:08:32,314
-We can sell it.
-And the Spaniard?

124
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:36,820
Unless l get a script called
l Schtupped Castro, l don't know.

125
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:40,655
-So what do you want?
-l want the golf cart.

126
00:08:40,861 --> 00:08:44,126
-No, it was a gift from Arnold.
-l'm kidding.

127
00:08:45,032 --> 00:08:48,399
-l can have anything?
-Yeah. Within reason.

128
00:08:49,637 --> 00:08:51,070
l want my job back.

129
00:08:51,272 --> 00:08:55,038
-Don't do this--
-Have a good junket. Keep me posted.

130
00:08:56,243 --> 00:08:57,369
All right. Yes.

131
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:02,975
You get them back together,
you can have your job.

132
00:09:04,385 --> 00:09:07,252
-Where are we booked?
-Four Seasons.

133
00:09:07,455 --> 00:09:11,858
No. Book us in the middle of nowhere,
where they can't escape.

134
00:09:12,059 --> 00:09:15,085
We need a hotel like the one
in The Shining.

135
00:09:15,296 --> 00:09:18,595
The new Hyatt in Nevada?
lt's in the desert.

136
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:21,962
Book it. We have to
keep the press entertained.

137
00:09:22,169 --> 00:09:26,105
Let the press think
it's about them, not the movie.

138
00:09:26,307 --> 00:09:30,243
Give them a lot to do:
parties, hayrides, circle jerks.

139
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:35,108
Help them forget they haven't seen
the movie. What about gifts?

140
00:09:35,316 --> 00:09:39,412
The movie's about a cop traveling
in time, so l did a gun.

141
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:42,680
-You're giving press members a gun?
-lt's not real--

142
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:45,358
We'll do a bag. Call the bag man.

143
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:49,996
Diamond earrings, money clips,
chocolate truffles, perfume.

144
00:09:50,231 --> 00:09:55,134
l don't want this to be awkward
for you, but l've got work to do.

145
00:09:55,569 --> 00:09:59,403
-How will you get Eddie and Gwen there?
-l know somebody.

146
00:09:59,673 --> 00:10:04,406
l love you. l'd do anything for you.
You're just asking an awful lot.

147
00:10:04,612 --> 00:10:09,072
A junket with Eddie isn't Gwen's
priority. Take the lilies out.

148
00:10:09,283 --> 00:10:11,410
Yes. l understand.

149
00:10:11,619 --> 00:10:14,611
Excuse me.
Could you please put that out?

150
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:18,622
-Gwen would love this.
-l can't take unsolicited material.

151
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:23,229
Just warning you it'll be a bit
of a fight. l'll do what l can.

152
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:24,795
God help us.

153
00:10:25,332 --> 00:10:28,995
When we come back from the break,
you know the scenario.

154
00:10:29,203 --> 00:10:32,798
-l've been here before.
-Look right at that camera.

155
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:34,736
Talk right to the caller.

156
00:10:34,942 --> 00:10:37,706
-Right down the tube.
-Okay, five seconds.

157
00:10:40,347 --> 00:10:43,316
Let's go to the calls
on Larry King Live.

158
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:46,953
-You're on the air with Gwen Harrison.
-Hi, Larry.

159
00:10:47,154 --> 00:10:49,987
Gwen, hi. l used to be a big fan...

160
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:55,185
...but l'm sorry, l can't get over
what happened with you and Eddie.

161
00:10:55,396 --> 00:10:59,127
-l can't sleep at night. How can you?
-Well....

162
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:04,327
You sleep next to a very handsome
young Spanish gentleman, don't you?

163
00:11:05,272 --> 00:11:09,106
Let's go to our next call.
Rock lsland, lllinois, hello.

164
00:11:09,476 --> 00:11:11,808
Gwen, l saw yourlatest movie.

165
00:11:12,012 --> 00:11:14,606
-Thank you.
-l couldn't sit through it.

166
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:17,579
without Eddie, it's not the same.

167
00:11:17,785 --> 00:11:21,721
This has to be hard.
Your last two movies without Eddie...

168
00:11:21,922 --> 00:11:24,117
...tanked at the box office.

169
00:11:24,758 --> 00:11:28,558
They were big in Europe
and huge in Japan, actually.

170
00:11:28,762 --> 00:11:31,856
Still, it must be tough.
Two duds in a row...

171
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:34,762
...lots of intrigue, whispers, talk.

172
00:11:34,969 --> 00:11:37,904
What happens if this one tanks?

173
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:42,402
l hate Larry King.
Why did l do his stupid show?

174
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:45,238
-Just breathe.
-l don't want to breathe.

175
00:11:45,446 --> 00:11:47,573
''Your last two movies tanked.''

176
00:11:47,781 --> 00:11:52,115
l wanted to choke him to death
with those stupid suspenders.

177
00:11:52,319 --> 00:11:54,651
-Everyone hates me.
-That's not true.

178
00:11:54,855 --> 00:11:58,882
The lighting was great.
Everybody said you looked great.

179
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:00,788
-Who?
-You looked great.

180
00:12:00,995 --> 00:12:04,089
-See?
-Thanks. As if she really knows.

181
00:12:04,298 --> 00:12:07,028
Water will make you feel better.

182
00:12:07,234 --> 00:12:11,102
l only like the water
with the electrolytes.

183
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:15,666
-Larry said you were amazing.
-Thank you.

184
00:12:15,876 --> 00:12:17,468
l love Larry.

185
00:12:17,678 --> 00:12:20,476
Let's love him down
to the dressing room.

186
00:12:26,553 --> 00:12:28,145
-Black or white?
-White.

187
00:12:29,156 --> 00:12:32,819
And those glasses!
Who wears frames that big anymore?

188
00:12:33,027 --> 00:12:34,892
He looks like a bug.

189
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:38,462
l just want this week to be over.

190
00:12:38,999 --> 00:12:43,163
Why can't the world accept
that l don't want to be with Eddie?

191
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:46,828
l just want to scream at people:
''Get a life!''

192
00:12:47,474 --> 00:12:51,467
-l want this week to be over. ls it?
-Almost. Push.

193
00:12:53,047 --> 00:12:55,311
-Kiki!
-l'm sorry.

194
00:12:57,518 --> 00:13:00,248
l smell smoke. ls somebody smoking?

195
00:13:01,755 --> 00:13:04,223
-l don't know.
-lt's probably Larry.

196
00:13:04,425 --> 00:13:08,327
-How many heart attacks has he had?
-Six? Maybe seven?

197
00:13:08,529 --> 00:13:11,930
Can we just go?
l don't want to be here anymore.

198
00:13:12,933 --> 00:13:15,026
-Those are beautiful.
-Okay.

199
00:13:15,235 --> 00:13:17,396
l got a call from Lee today.

200
00:13:17,604 --> 00:13:20,300
-Who?
-The studio's publicist? Remember?

201
00:13:20,507 --> 00:13:25,774
You got upset when Letterman didn't
air your show due to the Gulf War.

202
00:13:25,979 --> 00:13:31,042
-He was there with the English toffee.
-l remember the toffee. Great toffee.

203
00:13:31,251 --> 00:13:36,279
We'll get you some when you meet
with him to talk about the junket.

204
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:40,859
-Oh, God. Do l have to?
-Meet with him? Yes, you have to.

205
00:13:41,061 --> 00:13:45,157
lt's not fair. All this pressure
on me and none on Eddie.

206
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:47,493
He's probably having a ball.

207
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:51,034
This letter is a very
important part of healing.

208
00:13:51,238 --> 00:13:54,730
Writing your mom gives you the
opportunity to thank her...

209
00:13:54,942 --> 00:13:58,810
...or forgive her or ask her
why she did what she did.

210
00:13:59,079 --> 00:14:03,709
We don't mail it. But the act
of putting it on paper frees you.

211
00:14:03,917 --> 00:14:08,411
Allows you to let go.
Now, what did you say to your mother?

212
00:14:11,658 --> 00:14:13,148
''Dear Mom:

213
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,554
Fuck you.''

214
00:14:14,762 --> 00:14:18,596
Okay. We'll try the letter
some other time.

215
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:22,430
Are you comfortable
speaking about Gwen?

216
00:14:22,636 --> 00:14:24,934
-Think l should?
-There's no ''should.''

217
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:28,006
-Think l can?
-What is ''can''?

218
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:30,770
All right.

219
00:14:35,215 --> 00:14:40,050
There was this place in Chinatown.
Tiny little place.

220
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:43,519
They wouldn't bother us there.

221
00:14:43,724 --> 00:14:48,787
We'd get wonton soup and crumpled duck
and sit there for hours, talking.

222
00:14:48,996 --> 00:14:50,520
She took him there.

223
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:55,766
She took him to our crumpled duck.

224
00:15:00,474 --> 00:15:04,934
l followed them and l saw him
pouring the soup and smiling....

225
00:15:20,594 --> 00:15:22,619
lt was a total accident.

226
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:28,166
She told the press l tried to kill her.
That's crazy. She loves to overreact.

227
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:34,770
We have a saying, Edward.

228
00:15:38,111 --> 00:15:40,011
What is that? Bean salad?

229
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:44,175
What does that mean?

230
00:15:44,885 --> 00:15:47,945
l don't know what it means.
lt's very old.

231
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:55,893
l'm making progress.
l feel more secure.

232
00:15:56,096 --> 00:15:58,963
A lot more secure.
Do l seem more secure?

233
00:15:59,466 --> 00:16:03,095
You look great.
Whatever they're doing, it's working.

234
00:16:03,303 --> 00:16:05,771
Your face has color. l'm in love.

235
00:16:05,973 --> 00:16:08,874
They say two weeks here
changes your life.

236
00:16:09,076 --> 00:16:11,476
-When are two weeks up?
-Six months ago.

237
00:16:11,678 --> 00:16:16,115
-But l'm getting close to something.
-l can see that.

238
00:16:17,317 --> 00:16:21,947
-Did you watch Larry King last night?
-l was in the isolation tank.

239
00:16:22,155 --> 00:16:25,420
The reason l bring it up
is Gwen was on.

240
00:16:27,828 --> 00:16:31,059
-She took kind of a beating.
-She did, did she?

241
00:16:31,965 --> 00:16:36,800
You, young lady, are nobody
without Eddie! Nobody likes you!

242
00:16:37,004 --> 00:16:42,067
Never go anywhere without Eddie.
You're nothing. You're nothing!

243
00:16:42,276 --> 00:16:46,235
-Get her out of here now! Nothing!
-l'm so sorry, Larry.

244
00:16:47,848 --> 00:16:50,282
l guess she got what she deserved.

245
00:16:51,285 --> 00:16:56,382
Why are you here? Kiss Gandhi goodbye,
and let's get ready for the junket.

246
00:16:56,590 --> 00:17:01,220
-l'm not going! l'm not ready.
-The studio and the movie need you.

247
00:17:01,428 --> 00:17:04,795
l don't care about the movie.
How is it? Good?

248
00:17:04,998 --> 00:17:08,525
l've only seen the beginning,
but it's fantastic.

249
00:17:08,735 --> 00:17:12,136
Hold it up to your ear,
you'll scream ''Oscar.''

250
00:17:12,339 --> 00:17:15,069
-No, l'm not going.
-Gwen'll be there.

251
00:17:15,509 --> 00:17:16,999
You want to see her?

252
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:20,111
-No. lt's too soon.
-lt's a year and a half.

253
00:17:20,314 --> 00:17:24,341
Get it over with.
She fell in love with another guy.

254
00:17:24,551 --> 00:17:26,018
lt happens.

255
00:17:26,219 --> 00:17:30,451
Never to me, but if it did,
l wouldn't hide like some pussy!

256
00:17:30,657 --> 00:17:33,717
l'm not a pussy.
l'm still getting treatment.

257
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:38,626
This is serious stuff. My wellness
guide won't let me just go.

258
00:17:39,132 --> 00:17:40,565
-You can go.
-You sure?

259
00:17:40,767 --> 00:17:45,795
You just said l was a flower in
a stream, but a branch blocks my way.

260
00:17:46,006 --> 00:17:49,669
You read too much into my words.
Listen to your heart.

261
00:17:49,876 --> 00:17:53,937
-l'm the flower. l wanna stay.
-You're funny. We'll miss you.

262
00:17:54,147 --> 00:17:57,139
-Don't forget to be grateful.
-l'm grateful.

263
00:17:57,351 --> 00:18:01,151
l'm grateful for the sun.
for the stars in the sky--

264
00:18:01,355 --> 00:18:03,721
l'd be grateful if we could go.

265
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:08,523
-Why don't you wait in the car?
-Okay.

266
00:18:11,365 --> 00:18:12,730
l am the flower.

267
00:18:14,935 --> 00:18:16,562
l'm the flower.

268
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:19,534
-He kills me with his humor.
-Does he?

269
00:18:20,907 --> 00:18:25,776
l want to thank you for all your help.
You'll get the car in 1 0 days.

270
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:30,541
-Convertible.
-Leather interior, fully loaded.

271
00:18:30,917 --> 00:18:33,545
He'll get through this okay, right?

272
00:18:35,922 --> 00:18:37,719
Life is a cookie.

273
00:18:40,227 --> 00:18:42,218
l'll take that as a ''yes.''

274
00:18:42,429 --> 00:18:44,397
Okay. All right.

275
00:18:44,598 --> 00:18:45,963
Come on, Eddie!

276
00:18:47,768 --> 00:18:49,133
All right, buddy.

277
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,900
Ready to go? Here we go.

278
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:58,603
-Does Gwen know l'm coming?
-lt was her idea.

279
00:18:58,812 --> 00:19:01,007
Absolutely. She's really excited.

280
00:19:01,314 --> 00:19:05,808
Not in a million years.
lf that demented pig is there, no way.

281
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:09,921
-Eddie was temporarily insane.
-Don't stick up for him.

282
00:19:10,123 --> 00:19:12,591
-Kiki, look at you.
-Hi, Lee.

283
00:19:12,793 --> 00:19:14,283
-How are you?
-Good.

284
00:19:14,494 --> 00:19:16,223
-You look fabulous.
-Thanks.

285
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:20,764
-What did you do? ls it your hair?
-lt's my hair and a little sun.

286
00:19:21,334 --> 00:19:22,961
She lost 60 pounds.

287
00:19:25,005 --> 00:19:27,064
And l lost a little weight.

288
00:19:27,307 --> 00:19:30,276
l see that. You look terrific.

289
00:19:30,477 --> 00:19:31,876
Sixty pounds!

290
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:34,946
-That's a Backstreet Boy.
-Right?

291
00:19:35,148 --> 00:19:37,116
Are you here to talk to me?

292
00:19:37,317 --> 00:19:40,514
Of course. l'm sorry.
Eddie's not demented.

293
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:43,690
lt was a one-time,
forgive-and-forget thing.

294
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:48,020
He tried to kill me.
Am l the only one who remembers that?

295
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:51,527
Attempted murder doesn't get
attention anymore?

296
00:19:54,101 --> 00:19:57,798
He was just so in love with you
that he flipped out.

297
00:19:58,004 --> 00:20:01,235
You have this
powerful effect on people.

298
00:20:01,441 --> 00:20:04,376
That's true.
You sticking up for him again?

299
00:20:05,178 --> 00:20:07,009
Whose side am l on?

300
00:20:07,647 --> 00:20:11,743
Gwen, your dog just swallowed
your window-washer.

301
00:20:11,952 --> 00:20:13,010
Puppy.

302
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,387
Your puppy's a raptor.

303
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:19,782
-Prozac time. Excuse me.
-She's on Prozac?

304
00:20:19,993 --> 00:20:24,430
-lf only. The dog.
-Oh, the dog. That's not a bad thing.

305
00:20:24,498 --> 00:20:25,465
-Hey, baby.
-Hi, honey.

306
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:28,666
Here comes your sweaty big man.

307
00:20:28,869 --> 00:20:30,996
-You're sweaty.
-Who is this?

308
00:20:31,204 --> 00:20:34,332
l'm Lee, press agent
for Time Over Time.

309
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:38,671
-l'm not gonna sweep her off her feet.
-No, you're too old.

310
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:41,709
Hector, honey.

311
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:43,605
Be good.

312
00:20:43,817 --> 00:20:48,186
-l'm sorry. He's Spanish.
-No problem. l was Spanish once myself.

313
00:20:48,388 --> 00:20:50,549
Oh, l need kisses.

314
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,554
Oh, honey.

315
00:20:57,564 --> 00:20:59,259
Oh, there you go.

316
00:20:59,566 --> 00:21:00,726
Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

317
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:05,829
For why is he here now?

318
00:21:06,039 --> 00:21:09,236
He wants me to go
to the junket for the movie.

319
00:21:09,776 --> 00:21:11,607
We could do that. When?

320
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:15,077
We won't take up any
of your valuable time.

321
00:21:15,282 --> 00:21:18,615
-l'm not invited?
-lt's the studio's decision.

322
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:22,585
What do l care about the studio?
l don't give a shit.

323
00:21:22,789 --> 00:21:26,020
l go where Gwen goes. We're a couple.

324
00:21:26,226 --> 00:21:28,421
We'll go to the junket together.

325
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:31,187
Studio.

326
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:34,099
You're so beautiful.

327
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:39,495
l love you so much. l wanna marry you
and make something with our skins.

328
00:21:39,806 --> 00:21:42,502
We're not going. Eddie'll be there.

329
00:21:42,709 --> 00:21:47,112
We won't go because of him?
Listen. We're going to go...

330
00:21:47,314 --> 00:21:49,646
...and l'll personally protect you...

331
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:53,684
...if that psycho asshole bastard
tries to kill you again.

332
00:21:53,887 --> 00:21:57,687
-We're not going.
-Don't argue with me. We're going.

333
00:21:57,891 --> 00:22:01,987
Everybody wants me to go,
but nobody cares what l want!

334
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:04,288
-That's not true.
-Nobody cares!

335
00:22:04,497 --> 00:22:07,989
Don't you know the stress l have?
Everyone hates me.

336
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:11,602
Everyone wants a piece of me.
My shrink's out of town.

337
00:22:11,805 --> 00:22:16,799
l wasn't nominated for a Golden Globe
this year! Leave me alone.

338
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:19,569
Bastards.

339
00:22:21,081 --> 00:22:23,311
Are you pleased with yourself?

340
00:22:23,583 --> 00:22:27,986
l can't even enjoy my shower now,
Mr. Publicist-piece-of-shit.

341
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:30,883
Gwen is totally nuts.

342
00:22:33,193 --> 00:22:36,492
-Cleared the room. Well done.
-Talk to your sister.

343
00:22:36,696 --> 00:22:39,324
At least she pretends
to listen to you.

344
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:43,094
-Where is she?
-Grazing.

345
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:05,885
Nazi bastard.

346
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:07,283
Just kidding.

347
00:23:17,137 --> 00:23:19,537
You need to go to this junket.

348
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:22,337
-Why not?
-l'm afraid.

349
00:23:22,542 --> 00:23:23,531
Of...?

350
00:23:23,977 --> 00:23:27,105
That l'll see Eddie
and he'll be a mess.

351
00:23:27,314 --> 00:23:31,250
l'll feel guilty.
And l'm tired of feeling guilty.

352
00:23:31,718 --> 00:23:32,707
l know.

353
00:23:33,987 --> 00:23:37,218
l'm always thinking
about other people.

354
00:23:37,557 --> 00:23:38,751
l know you are.

355
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:42,656
l hate being the only one
who cares about others.

356
00:23:42,996 --> 00:23:47,399
lf they see Eddie down and sad,
they'll pity him and blame me.

357
00:23:48,268 --> 00:23:52,102
-So what you're worried about is you.
-Of course.

358
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:54,830
Does everyone hate me, Kiki?

359
00:23:56,609 --> 00:23:59,737
-No one hates you.
-Yes, they do.

360
00:23:59,946 --> 00:24:03,040
l was in that great store on Melrose.

361
00:24:03,249 --> 00:24:08,050
There was a baby in a stroller
looking at me, and he was judging me.

362
00:24:08,355 --> 00:24:12,314
The whole world is judging me
for what l did to Eddie.

363
00:24:14,027 --> 00:24:17,155
Look, l'll admit...

364
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:21,196
...the Miss Adorable image
has been called into question.

365
00:24:21,401 --> 00:24:23,699
All the more reason to go.

366
00:24:23,903 --> 00:24:28,465
Smile nice with Eddie for the weekend,
win back audience goodwill.

367
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:31,041
-You think it would help?
-l do.

368
00:24:31,444 --> 00:24:35,437
l could give Eddie the divorce papers.
That's a plus.

369
00:24:35,882 --> 00:24:39,374
-You sure you're ready to do that?
-l'm sure.

370
00:24:39,586 --> 00:24:42,885
-Why are you still questioning me?
-lt's Eddie.

371
00:24:43,089 --> 00:24:47,890
He'd sing ''Yellow Submarine'' at the
top of his lungs to make you laugh...

372
00:24:48,094 --> 00:24:51,222
...and save the mango
in his fruit salad for you.

373
00:24:51,464 --> 00:24:54,661
Exactly. Eddie.
You're just a romantic, Kiki.

374
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:58,099
You know nothing about married life.

375
00:24:59,172 --> 00:25:00,833
You got me there.

376
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:12,079
l won't be able to get through this
on my own. Can you help me?

377
00:25:12,285 --> 00:25:13,912
l'll help you.

378
00:25:21,494 --> 00:25:22,893
These are new pants.

379
00:25:24,397 --> 00:25:26,228
Good dog. Get the paper.

380
00:25:26,433 --> 00:25:27,559
Come on.

381
00:25:28,301 --> 00:25:29,632
Come on. Please.

382
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:35,303
-Help.
-Don't let me interrupt.

383
00:25:35,508 --> 00:25:36,907
What happened?

384
00:25:37,143 --> 00:25:40,977
l'm packing her things
because we're going to a junket.

385
00:25:41,214 --> 00:25:46,151
-Really? Great! You're a great sister.
-l'm a great assistant.

386
00:25:48,054 --> 00:25:49,487
To the left.

387
00:26:51,484 --> 00:26:53,952
-These are herbal medications.
-Okay.

388
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:57,715
People wrote l was on Zoloft,
but this is holistic.

389
00:26:57,924 --> 00:27:00,484
-Sure got a lot.
-Watch the road, please.

390
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:04,352
Bobby? He wants you to pull over.

391
00:27:04,697 --> 00:27:07,222
-This is Kishtonga root.
-Yeah, okay.

392
00:27:07,433 --> 00:27:10,129
-Why are we stopping?
-l was told to.

393
00:27:13,273 --> 00:27:14,433
So how you doing?

394
00:27:14,641 --> 00:27:17,269
-Fine. Why?
-l gotta hand it to you.

395
00:27:17,477 --> 00:27:22,779
lf my lady left me for another guy,
l'd swallow a gun. l'd get drunk...

396
00:27:22,982 --> 00:27:26,110
...lay on the tracks
and wait for a train.

397
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:28,913
Could we please not talk about that?

398
00:27:30,089 --> 00:27:33,456
You know something?
People say l look like you.

399
00:27:34,494 --> 00:27:37,622
Not that we look alike.
But l project you.

400
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:41,129
l project the essence of you,
like a you-ness.

401
00:27:41,334 --> 00:27:44,167
-Can you put that partition up?
-Yes, sir.

402
00:27:48,808 --> 00:27:51,106
How you doing? How's it going?

403
00:27:51,311 --> 00:27:54,508
l was just getting a pep talk
from my driver.

404
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:59,549
l'm orchestrating the hotel arrival.
Should you or Gwen pull up first?

405
00:27:59,752 --> 00:28:04,883
-Where did you come from, man?
-Here. l'm riding with Gwen.

406
00:28:05,992 --> 00:28:07,584
Gwen's back there?

407
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:11,125
Yes. So do you want
to arrive first or second?

408
00:28:12,265 --> 00:28:14,665
-Second.
-Be right back.

409
00:28:22,609 --> 00:28:24,668
-He wants to go second.
-Let him.

410
00:28:24,877 --> 00:28:27,107
-He can go second.
-Great.

411
00:28:27,313 --> 00:28:29,144
Wait. He should go first.

412
00:28:29,349 --> 00:28:33,786
l don't want to look like his
opening act. l want to go second.

413
00:28:33,987 --> 00:28:36,785
-She wants to go second.
-Second it is.

414
00:28:42,028 --> 00:28:45,794
-She wants to go second.
-Fine. Let her. l don't care.

415
00:28:46,199 --> 00:28:49,930
From behind, she'll see the knife
she stuck in my back.

416
00:28:50,136 --> 00:28:51,694
Thank you.

417
00:28:53,473 --> 00:28:55,270
-Okay?
-Second? We're set.

418
00:28:55,475 --> 00:28:57,033
-Great.
-Who cares?

419
00:28:57,243 --> 00:29:01,111
-She doesn't care.
-Yes, l do. l'm going first.

420
00:29:08,855 --> 00:29:12,916
-l don't care! Why is this an issue?
-l'm just trying--

421
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:14,787
Let's go to the hotel!

422
00:29:14,994 --> 00:29:18,725
-You're second.
-l don't care! l don't care!

423
00:29:18,931 --> 00:29:21,263
-l don't care!
-You're going second.

424
00:29:22,602 --> 00:29:24,399
You're going second.

425
00:29:24,737 --> 00:29:26,898
-l don't care.
-Okay, thank you.

426
00:29:31,544 --> 00:29:32,704
That was easy.

427
00:29:34,247 --> 00:29:37,216
-Why do we have to go second?
-Drive the car!

428
00:29:47,627 --> 00:29:51,393
l'm grateful for the sun.
l'm grateful for the moon.

429
00:29:51,631 --> 00:29:53,792
l'm grateful for the cool...

430
00:29:54,567 --> 00:29:56,660
...cool night breeze.

431
00:30:06,979 --> 00:30:09,914
lt's a happy night
for Eddie and Gwen fans.

432
00:30:10,116 --> 00:30:14,678
A year ago, America's sweethearts
went bust in dramatic fashion.

433
00:30:15,054 --> 00:30:19,184
Here they come now.
Hi, Gwen, you look wonderful tonight.

434
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:22,884
-Can l get a shot? Look this way!
-That's it.

435
00:30:37,076 --> 00:30:39,169
Gwen, who's a better lover?

436
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:42,241
Okay, right this way.

437
00:30:45,618 --> 00:30:47,176
Eddie, here we go.

438
00:30:47,387 --> 00:30:49,082
-You look great.
-Thank you.

439
00:30:49,288 --> 00:30:52,689
-What's it like working with Gwen?
-l can't remember.

440
00:31:09,642 --> 00:31:12,668
That was so good.
That had to feel good.

441
00:31:12,879 --> 00:31:16,975
lt was good we went second.
Everybody loved you.

442
00:31:17,183 --> 00:31:20,778
-What is this?
-Serenity tea from the Wellness Center.

443
00:31:21,387 --> 00:31:25,483
l don't know what's in it,
but it gets me calm and focused.

444
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:34,526
l can't do this! l told you
this was a mistake.

445
00:31:34,734 --> 00:31:38,465
She's very close, right?
ln the next room. l feel her.

446
00:31:38,671 --> 00:31:41,367
No, she's in a cottage in the back.

447
00:31:41,574 --> 00:31:43,371
l sensed it. She's close.

448
00:31:43,576 --> 00:31:46,511
The cottages are way back
on the property.

449
00:31:46,712 --> 00:31:49,704
lt's so shocking.
You're with somebody.

450
00:31:49,916 --> 00:31:55,115
You think you'll spend your life--
She has a cottage and l get a suite?

451
00:31:55,354 --> 00:31:57,379
-She has an entourage.
-Me too!

452
00:31:57,590 --> 00:32:00,684
-You do?
-l'm a schizo. l'm my own entourage.

453
00:32:00,893 --> 00:32:04,124
-Let me move you.
-No, it's not important.

454
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:08,790
l'm grateful for this suite
and minibar.

455
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:12,593
-The cottages are probably small.
-Actually, they're...

456
00:32:12,805 --> 00:32:13,829
...tiny.

457
00:32:14,073 --> 00:32:15,938
-Small?
-lt's ridiculous.

458
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:18,133
-Good.
-Want to get room service?

459
00:32:18,344 --> 00:32:22,906
l'll take some herbs, numb out,
have a shower and go to bed alone.

460
00:32:23,115 --> 00:32:25,413
-You've been great.
-What did l do?

461
00:32:25,618 --> 00:32:29,418
Showed up. That's enough.
Rest, l don't want you puffy.

462
00:33:31,918 --> 00:33:33,408
Jesus.

463
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:46,730
-Hey, Steve.
-What?

464
00:33:46,933 --> 00:33:49,868
Some guy's whacking it
near cottage number 4.

465
00:33:53,506 --> 00:33:55,531
Oh, that's....

466
00:33:55,808 --> 00:33:59,869
That's disgusting.
l don't want to deal with this now.

467
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:03,879
Every time l get this shift,
there's always some sicko.

468
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:06,950
l can't catch a break around here.

469
00:34:10,323 --> 00:34:13,156
Sir, l'm sure things
are different in L.A...

470
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:16,726
...but in Nevada,
we prosecute public masturbation.

471
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:20,057
-l've been in Las Vegas--
-l was not--!

472
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:24,566
-We saw you on our cameras.
-l was pulling out the prickers!

473
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:26,761
l'm trying to put out a fire.

474
00:34:26,973 --> 00:34:30,204
-l fell into a cactus.
-He fell into a cactus.

475
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:35,309
That's it. Unless you usually arrest
those who bump into succulents...

476
00:34:35,514 --> 00:34:38,449
...l suggest we call it a night.

477
00:34:38,651 --> 00:34:41,449
We still have to fill out a report--

478
00:34:41,654 --> 00:34:44,919
Listen. l'm not supposed
to do this, but....

479
00:34:45,257 --> 00:34:49,023
l have beautiful bags
that are exclusive for the press.

480
00:34:49,228 --> 00:34:52,527
Got girlfriends?
We have real diamond earrings.

481
00:34:52,732 --> 00:34:56,964
-Beautiful, very tasty. Very delicate.
-l saw the bags.

482
00:34:57,203 --> 00:34:58,192
They're nice.

483
00:34:58,404 --> 00:35:01,237
Very nice. The highest quality.

484
00:35:04,143 --> 00:35:09,080
-We don't have to file a report.
-Because l didn't do anything, morons!

485
00:35:09,815 --> 00:35:13,114
Diet pills.
Usually he's like a pussycat.

486
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:15,344
-All right.
-All right? Okay.

487
00:35:15,554 --> 00:35:17,249
Thank you, guys.

488
00:35:19,825 --> 00:35:24,353
Fellas, one other thing. l need
the tape from the security camera...

489
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:27,690
...just in case something
gets out, all right?

490
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:31,826
Danny will go with you
to get the tape, all right?

491
00:35:34,173 --> 00:35:37,006
Thank you, fellas. Appreciate a lot.

492
00:35:41,847 --> 00:35:46,511
-Rent-a-cops. You got me on the edge.
-What were you doing there?

493
00:35:46,719 --> 00:35:49,153
l just wanted to see her again.

494
00:35:49,355 --> 00:35:53,655
l saw her standing by the pool,
and she looked so fantastic.

495
00:35:53,859 --> 00:35:55,349
l just miss her.

496
00:35:55,761 --> 00:36:00,221
Don't give me that look.
l know that look. lt means trouble.

497
00:36:00,433 --> 00:36:04,961
Calm down. Go to your room,
go to bed and stay out of trouble.

498
00:36:05,171 --> 00:36:07,901
-l wasn't getting in trouble!
-No, no.

499
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:11,906
-Just whacking off on a cactus.
-l wasn't!

500
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:14,543
lt looks as ifEddie Thomas...

501
00:36:14,747 --> 00:36:19,707
...may change his name to ''Peeping''
afteran incident at the Hyatt.

502
00:36:20,186 --> 00:36:23,178
This tape clearly shows Thomas...

503
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:27,655
...in the words of one hotel guard,
''doing himselfa big favor''...

504
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:31,229
...outside his
estranged wife's cottage.

505
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:34,092
Oh, my God!

506
00:36:36,936 --> 00:36:38,927
Oh, my God.

507
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:50,314
Thomas is in town fora pressjunket
for the new Eddie and Gwen movie.

508
00:36:50,516 --> 00:36:54,043
Sources say this latest
incident is not surprising...

509
00:36:54,253 --> 00:36:59,350
...given Thomas' delicate mental state
since his split with Gwen.

510
00:36:59,558 --> 00:37:03,585
-Know what the movie's about?
-By the looks ofit...

511
00:37:03,796 --> 00:37:06,924
...we're looking at a remake
ofCool Hand Luke.

512
00:37:07,133 --> 00:37:11,968
lt was on the news! He was outside
doing something not good!

513
00:37:12,171 --> 00:37:14,435
Gwen, everybody does it.

514
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:17,939
l know everyone does it.
That's not the point.

515
00:37:22,715 --> 00:37:24,478
What is going on?

516
00:37:24,884 --> 00:37:27,011
ls he trying to kill me again?

517
00:37:27,219 --> 00:37:32,486
With the weapon he had in hand, l
doubt it. People don't kill at Hyatts.

518
00:37:32,691 --> 00:37:35,285
Other chains, yes. But the Hyatt, no.

519
00:37:35,895 --> 00:37:37,123
Get some rest.

520
00:37:37,329 --> 00:37:40,059
Somebody has to be beautiful tomorrow.

521
00:37:40,933 --> 00:37:41,991
l know.

522
00:37:42,434 --> 00:37:43,492
l have to go.

523
00:37:44,036 --> 00:37:45,264
Good night.

524
00:37:47,373 --> 00:37:52,140
Eddie, l am so pissed off!
l have the tape! They had a copy!

525
00:37:52,344 --> 00:37:56,075
Bastards. Everybody's got a price.

526
00:37:56,282 --> 00:37:59,774
Hold on just a second,
it's room service.

527
00:38:08,928 --> 00:38:11,556
No, it's just-- Hold on one second.

528
00:38:11,764 --> 00:38:16,326
Put it over there.
That is beluga, right? Yeah, thanks.

529
00:38:16,535 --> 00:38:19,834
We're fine. lt's all local.
Nothing national.

530
00:38:20,039 --> 00:38:24,999
They'll issue a retraction tomorrow.
You're fine. There's no damage.

531
00:38:25,211 --> 00:38:29,875
lt's just a little blip.
lt's what you said. lt's in the past.

532
00:38:30,082 --> 00:38:34,985
The beach grass grows toward the sun
in the universe you're grateful for.

533
00:38:35,387 --> 00:38:37,582
You know? Get some rest.

534
00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:42,022
Someone has to look handsome
tomorrow. Okay, Mr. Big Time?

535
00:38:42,795 --> 00:38:44,353
See you in the morning.

536
00:38:44,563 --> 00:38:46,861
-Do you like Eddie?
-l love him.

537
00:38:47,066 --> 00:38:50,263
-You leaked the tape.
-Survival rule number three:

538
00:38:50,469 --> 00:38:54,030
You're not here to love.
You're here to promote.

539
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,071
That's it. Period.

540
00:38:56,709 --> 00:39:01,339
You get word your mother died,
hit by a bus or something.

541
00:39:01,547 --> 00:39:04,744
You go downstairs,
shed a tear and say:

542
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:08,215
''lt's a shame.
She would've loved this movie.''

543
00:39:19,298 --> 00:39:22,426
l gotta talk to Eddie.
l'm worried about him.

544
00:39:23,369 --> 00:39:25,997
-You do that.
-Go get him for me.

545
00:39:26,205 --> 00:39:28,673
-Me?
-l have to talk to him tonight.

546
00:39:28,874 --> 00:39:33,868
Or l'll be up all night and look
terrible tomorrow. Really puffy.

547
00:39:36,048 --> 00:39:37,879
l don't think....

548
00:39:39,718 --> 00:39:41,709
-l can't.
-Why not?

549
00:39:42,388 --> 00:39:45,880
Because l'm sleeping.
And because l just....

550
00:39:46,725 --> 00:39:51,185
l feel funny getting in the middle
of things with the two of you.

551
00:39:51,397 --> 00:39:54,491
-Can't you handle this yourself?
-What?

552
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:57,100
l don't handle anything myself.

553
00:39:57,303 --> 00:40:00,136
-Why are you being so difficult?
-l'm not.

554
00:40:00,339 --> 00:40:04,503
l'm only asking for
a teensy-weensy favor. That's all.

555
00:40:04,743 --> 00:40:07,735
Please, Kiki. Please.

556
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:11,610
Please, please, please,
please, Kiki-Kiki-Ki.

557
00:40:16,855 --> 00:40:18,288
God!

558
00:40:22,027 --> 00:40:24,291
Your pillow's better than mine.

559
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:25,861
Take it.

560
00:40:57,730 --> 00:40:58,719
How are you?

561
00:40:58,931 --> 00:41:03,595
My marriage is shit and l make
crappy films. Otherwise, l'm great.

562
00:41:03,802 --> 00:41:04,791
l'm sorry.

563
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:07,302
-Why's she doing this?
-l don't know.

564
00:41:07,506 --> 00:41:11,101
-l like your movies.
-They're shit, come on.

565
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:16,407
-What's going on? She say anything?
-l'm shocked. l really am shocked.

566
00:41:16,615 --> 00:41:18,674
-l didn't know.
-l'm not perfect...

567
00:41:18,884 --> 00:41:23,253
...but l thought we had something.
She wants me to move out.

568
00:41:23,455 --> 00:41:24,649
l know.

569
00:41:25,257 --> 00:41:27,691
He'll sit in my chair, watch my TV...

570
00:41:27,893 --> 00:41:31,294
...walk my dog,
sleep in my bed with my....

571
00:41:31,497 --> 00:41:33,465
l don't know what happened.

572
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,090
Well, it's not you.

573
00:41:37,436 --> 00:41:41,770
You're a great guy.
lf she can't see that, she's blind.

574
00:41:41,974 --> 00:41:44,772
-You are wonderful.
-l don't feel wonderful.

575
00:41:44,977 --> 00:41:46,103
lt'll be okay.

576
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,838
l don't think so.

577
00:41:51,917 --> 00:41:53,851
But thanks for saying that.

578
00:41:54,787 --> 00:41:58,279
-Thanks for coming. You're sweet.
-No, you are.

579
00:41:58,490 --> 00:42:01,948
No, you are. You're a good friend.

580
00:42:07,466 --> 00:42:08,933
You're a rock.

581
00:42:33,158 --> 00:42:35,422
-Come here!
-Nice to see you.

582
00:42:35,661 --> 00:42:36,923
You too.

583
00:42:37,830 --> 00:42:40,458
-You look good.
-Misery agrees with me.

584
00:42:40,666 --> 00:42:42,657
-You look good too.
-Thank you.

585
00:42:42,868 --> 00:42:47,237
You've been getting healthy.
You lifting a little weights?

586
00:42:47,439 --> 00:42:50,465
Not lifting weights
so much as losing weight.

587
00:42:50,676 --> 00:42:53,372
-You always looked good to me.
-Thanks.

588
00:42:53,579 --> 00:42:56,047
-Want something to drink?
-l'm fine.

589
00:42:56,248 --> 00:42:57,579
Sit down.

590
00:42:57,983 --> 00:43:00,474
lt's been too long. l saw you last--

591
00:43:00,686 --> 00:43:03,553
That night.
l feel terrible about that.

592
00:43:04,990 --> 00:43:08,858
That was the low point.
l'd found out about Hector.

593
00:43:09,061 --> 00:43:11,689
l took advantage of the situation.

594
00:43:11,897 --> 00:43:15,799
Talk about bottoming out.
l was drunk. l think l kissed you.

595
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:18,959
Did l?

596
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:24,166
-l don't recall.
-lf l was inappropriate, forgive me.

597
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:27,205
-Sure. Yeah.
-Thanks, Keek.

598
00:43:28,046 --> 00:43:29,035
Are you okay?

599
00:43:29,248 --> 00:43:33,548
A few hours ago, no. But something
incredible happened tonight.

600
00:43:33,752 --> 00:43:39,054
l was walking by the cottages, and it
was like Gwen was drawing me to her.

601
00:43:39,258 --> 00:43:40,953
l look over this wall.

602
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:45,529
There she was, standing by the pool,
all dressed in white...

603
00:43:45,731 --> 00:43:48,700
...like an angel in the desert.
l thought:

604
00:43:48,901 --> 00:43:51,961
''That's why you're here.
To win her back.''

605
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:54,196
No way she'll stay with Hector.

606
00:43:54,406 --> 00:43:58,240
l'm supposed to spend
the rest of my life with her.

607
00:43:58,777 --> 00:44:00,301
Really?

608
00:44:01,413 --> 00:44:03,574
The woman by the pool?

609
00:44:06,952 --> 00:44:10,046
-That's why l'm here.
-What do you mean?

610
00:44:14,026 --> 00:44:17,655
-Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm are rocking out.
-what?

611
00:44:17,863 --> 00:44:19,228
Kiki and Eddie left.

612
00:44:19,431 --> 00:44:22,093
-Why'd you say that?
-lt's code. lt's fun!

613
00:44:22,301 --> 00:44:24,064
l wonder what she wants.

614
00:44:24,269 --> 00:44:27,670
l don't know what she wants.
lt'd be good to know.

615
00:44:27,873 --> 00:44:29,170
l know what l want.

616
00:44:29,374 --> 00:44:32,537
Siegfried and Roy
are heading for the pool.

617
00:44:32,744 --> 00:44:35,542
-Siegfried and Roy?
-Not the real Siegfried--

618
00:44:35,747 --> 00:44:38,181
You wanted to play this game.

619
00:44:38,383 --> 00:44:40,851
Heads, we stay apart.
Tails, we reunite.

620
00:44:41,053 --> 00:44:42,953
-You need to flip a coin?
-Yes.

621
00:44:43,155 --> 00:44:45,419
Here we go. One, two, three.

622
00:44:45,624 --> 00:44:47,922
-A possum.
-A possible possum.

623
00:44:49,828 --> 00:44:51,295
Wait, not here.

624
00:44:51,496 --> 00:44:56,092
Felix, this is Oscar.
The monkey is in daycare.

625
00:45:12,284 --> 00:45:14,275
Your mystery date awaits.

626
00:45:15,454 --> 00:45:16,785
Wish me luck.

627
00:45:43,115 --> 00:45:46,050
l'm sorry. l'm so sorry.

628
00:45:46,551 --> 00:45:51,545
l know you'll never forgive me,
but please, please take me back.

629
00:45:51,957 --> 00:45:55,984
That a gun in your pocket
or are you just happy to see me?

630
00:45:56,194 --> 00:45:57,889
Actually, it's a gun.

631
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:23,979
-Hello, Eddie.
-Hi, Gwen.

632
00:46:24,189 --> 00:46:27,625
-l've been so worried about you.
-Have you been?

633
00:46:28,427 --> 00:46:32,261
That happens when your wife
shacks up with someone else.

634
00:46:32,698 --> 00:46:34,529
l'm dealing with my anger.

635
00:46:34,766 --> 00:46:39,260
l understand. Get that out.
Just shake it out. Throw it away.

636
00:46:39,471 --> 00:46:43,635
-That's great advice. Thank you.
-l have no right to ask this--

637
00:46:43,842 --> 00:46:46,276
-Ask me what?
-When we did the movie...

638
00:46:46,478 --> 00:46:48,173
...did you fool around?

639
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:53,317
You've got no right to ask me that.
l wasn't fooling around.

640
00:46:53,518 --> 00:46:57,579
-The girl who played your daughter?
-What's wrong with you?

641
00:46:57,789 --> 00:47:00,724
-You're very hostile.
-l can't imagine why.

642
00:47:00,926 --> 00:47:02,154
This was a mistake.

643
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:04,591
-lt wasn't.
-lt was. Tomorrow...

644
00:47:04,796 --> 00:47:07,924
...let's be professional
and promote this movie...

645
00:47:08,133 --> 00:47:11,125
...because we both need
this one to do well.

646
00:47:11,336 --> 00:47:12,735
l know you do.

647
00:47:14,573 --> 00:47:19,567
And if they ask about the breakup,
we say that it was a difficult time...

648
00:47:19,778 --> 00:47:22,679
...that we're working
through it together.

649
00:47:22,881 --> 00:47:25,645
-And we're still close, okay?
-Fine.

650
00:47:26,251 --> 00:47:28,242
-Whatever.
-Good.

651
00:47:28,987 --> 00:47:30,318
l have to go.

652
00:47:36,161 --> 00:47:38,652
-See you tomorrow.
-You're not ev--?

653
00:47:42,167 --> 00:47:45,364
-Here. There you go.
-Thanks.

654
00:48:40,125 --> 00:48:44,687
That's how junkets go. lt's a
great opportunity. l can handle--

655
00:48:44,896 --> 00:48:47,956
ls this a scene from theirnew movie?

656
00:48:48,166 --> 00:48:52,694
No, that's Gwen and Eddie dancing
in the moonlight forreal.

657
00:48:52,904 --> 00:48:56,237
-America's sweethearts...
-What the hell's going on?

658
00:48:56,441 --> 00:48:58,375
...in a passionate embrace.

659
00:48:59,110 --> 00:49:00,134
Goddamn it!

660
00:49:00,345 --> 00:49:05,544
My life is so stressful. People have
no idea what it's like being me.

661
00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:07,445
Did we brush my teeth?

662
00:49:07,652 --> 00:49:10,086
See? l can't even remember that.

663
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:15,018
Good morning, you two.
Come on, smile. Here we go.

664
00:49:15,227 --> 00:49:19,061
Ladies and gentlemen,
Eddie and Gwen, together again!

665
00:49:21,566 --> 00:49:24,831
There they are! America's sweethearts!

666
00:49:31,343 --> 00:49:33,538
What's this? Only five minutes?

667
00:49:33,745 --> 00:49:36,578
Mention jerking off,
l'll pull your plug.

668
00:49:36,781 --> 00:49:40,911
lt's plenty of time to talk
about a movie l haven't seen.

669
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:42,950
Yeah, but it's fabulous.

670
00:49:46,591 --> 00:49:48,252
Do you need anything?

671
00:49:49,361 --> 00:49:51,261
-Doesn't she look great?
-Who?

672
00:49:51,463 --> 00:49:53,829
Your sister looks incredible.

673
00:49:54,032 --> 00:49:58,662
-Are you trying to make me jealous?
-Would that be possible?

674
00:49:58,870 --> 00:50:00,497
Then why care if l try?

675
00:50:00,705 --> 00:50:04,869
Okay, who's happy? Ready to go?
Thanks. Always a pleasure.

676
00:50:05,076 --> 00:50:06,771
Byron, it's all yours.

677
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:12,109
Byron Allen, coming to you
from EntertainmentStudios.com.

678
00:50:12,317 --> 00:50:15,912
Strap yourself in.
l'm with America's sweethearts:

679
00:50:16,121 --> 00:50:18,055
Eddie Thomas and Gwen Harrison.

680
00:50:18,290 --> 00:50:21,851
Ready for this?
They're not trying to kill each other.

681
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:25,427
Are you back together?
You look very comfortable.

682
00:50:25,630 --> 00:50:28,929
l'll be honest.
Before l came down from the room...

683
00:50:29,134 --> 00:50:34,470
...l took about a pound of Vicodin.
l'll be comfortable till late March.

684
00:50:39,611 --> 00:50:42,307
You're funny.
How do you live with him?

685
00:50:42,647 --> 00:50:44,012
She doesn't.

686
00:50:45,383 --> 00:50:47,317
She lives with someone else.

687
00:50:50,455 --> 00:50:55,358
Must've been exciting working with
Hal Weidmann. Were you apprehensive?

688
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:58,757
Oh, no. No, Hal's brilliant.

689
00:50:59,998 --> 00:51:03,991
He's so easy to work with.
He loves actors.

690
00:51:04,202 --> 00:51:05,931
Just loves actors.

691
00:51:06,137 --> 00:51:09,538
You had a nervous breakdown
recently, didn't you?

692
00:51:10,175 --> 00:51:11,199
What?

693
00:51:11,409 --> 00:51:16,176
Can audiences watch you without
recalling your attack on Ms. Harrison?

694
00:51:17,449 --> 00:51:19,883
That's five minutes. Thank you.

695
00:51:21,853 --> 00:51:25,846
lt was so great meeting you guys.
l'm a huge fan.

696
00:51:26,191 --> 00:51:27,180
Lunch?

697
00:51:32,397 --> 00:51:34,558
Why does he get a neck-rub?

698
00:51:34,766 --> 00:51:36,757
-l want one.
-He's so tense.

699
00:51:36,968 --> 00:51:41,598
Hello? l have a neck too.
This thing holding up my head.

700
00:51:41,806 --> 00:51:42,830
And we're back.

701
00:51:43,708 --> 00:51:45,972
-Everybody ready?
-Of course.

702
00:51:47,712 --> 00:51:48,736
Of course.

703
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:56,177
Hello again, Syracuse.
Mort Josephson, your Movie Maven.

704
00:51:56,388 --> 00:51:59,789
Ann Arbor, l'm Laura Messinger,
the Cinemaniac.

705
00:51:59,991 --> 00:52:02,289
-Popcorn's buttered.
-Lights dim.

706
00:52:02,494 --> 00:52:04,018
-lt's Bob....
-And Ken.

707
00:52:04,229 --> 00:52:06,060
At the Multiplex.

708
00:52:06,398 --> 00:52:10,391
We're great friends.
We talk every day.

709
00:52:10,802 --> 00:52:13,327
We're better friends than ever.

710
00:52:13,538 --> 00:52:16,200
We talk two, three times a day.

711
00:52:16,408 --> 00:52:21,812
We're just cosmically, spiritually
bound. Eddie's really good...

712
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:24,548
...and he's my pillar of strength.

713
00:52:24,749 --> 00:52:28,378
lt's like Sodom and Gomorrah.
So strong, you know?

714
00:52:28,586 --> 00:52:29,917
And that's five.

715
00:52:30,355 --> 00:52:33,483
ln spite of all
the emotion and hurt...

716
00:52:33,692 --> 00:52:36,718
...we leaned on each other for
support.

717
00:52:37,362 --> 00:52:42,561
That's when l realized how strong
our friendship really was.

718
00:52:43,868 --> 00:52:45,927
-We're in constant contact.
-Right.

719
00:52:46,137 --> 00:52:48,765
l mean, not only
are we great friends...

720
00:52:48,973 --> 00:52:51,908
...and not only are we
in constant contact--

721
00:52:52,110 --> 00:52:54,271
You should see our phone bills.

722
00:52:55,180 --> 00:52:56,204
We've also done--

723
00:52:56,414 --> 00:53:00,851
l don't know, how should l put this?
Hell, l'll just say it.

724
00:53:01,052 --> 00:53:05,045
We've done a few three-ways.
This guy she's with now....

725
00:53:05,256 --> 00:53:08,225
l can't say l'm happy. She's my wife.

726
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:13,122
But after spending time in the sack
with him, l see the attraction.

727
00:53:13,631 --> 00:53:18,261
But for a fairly big guy, he's not
packing much south of the border.

728
00:53:18,503 --> 00:53:21,438
And that's five minutes.
Thank you so much.

729
00:53:21,673 --> 00:53:25,404
Say hi to everybody in Salt Lake.
Good to see you.

730
00:53:25,610 --> 00:53:26,599
Next.

731
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:28,401
-Hi, guys!
-Hi, guys.

732
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:31,046
-That wasn't funny.
-lt was a joke.

733
00:53:31,249 --> 00:53:35,015
-l do that after 400 interviews.
-Hector won't find it funny.

734
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:38,849
Guess what? l don't give
a shit what he thinks.

735
00:53:39,424 --> 00:53:41,585
Take a picture with my baby?

736
00:53:41,926 --> 00:53:43,894
Just smile and shut up.

737
00:53:49,968 --> 00:53:52,869
-You have given me 1 1 0% today.
-Who has?

738
00:53:53,071 --> 00:53:55,062
You. lt's been a great day.

739
00:53:55,273 --> 00:53:58,037
-What do you want?
-A small favor.

740
00:53:58,243 --> 00:53:59,835
45 minutes, an hour.

741
00:54:00,044 --> 00:54:02,638
l need you to have dinner with Gwen.

742
00:54:02,847 --> 00:54:05,247
-lt'll be great.
-l won't do it.

743
00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:09,978
-You should do this.
-l'm gonna be alone with the minibar.

744
00:54:10,188 --> 00:54:13,715
We're in deep shit.
Hal's holding the film hostage.

745
00:54:13,925 --> 00:54:18,419
We have nothing! Understand?
But l do have you. You and Gwen.

746
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:21,827
When you're together,
the press forgets that.

747
00:54:22,033 --> 00:54:25,093
lt's roses blooming,
flags flying, pudding--

748
00:54:25,303 --> 00:54:27,430
-Are you on something?
-A panic high.

749
00:54:27,639 --> 00:54:31,598
Just order an entrée,
chew a little bit, smile and go.

750
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:36,008
They have delightful pork tenderloin.
8:00. Thank you so much!

751
00:54:36,214 --> 00:54:37,738
-lt's Gwen's idea.
-Really?

752
00:54:37,949 --> 00:54:39,007
Absolutely.

753
00:54:39,984 --> 00:54:42,851
l can't believe you said
l'd have dinner.

754
00:54:43,054 --> 00:54:45,887
They serve a very nice
pork tenderloin.

755
00:54:46,090 --> 00:54:48,854
l'm not going. Here.

756
00:54:49,060 --> 00:54:52,621
l was with him enough today
for the rest of my life.

757
00:54:52,831 --> 00:54:56,824
-l gotta give him the divorce papers.
-When?

758
00:54:57,335 --> 00:54:58,927
Just before we leave.

759
00:54:59,504 --> 00:55:02,905
What, toss them at him
as your limo pulls away?

760
00:55:03,107 --> 00:55:06,406
You don't understand.
lt's very complicated.

761
00:55:06,611 --> 00:55:11,708
Being nice makes giving him the papers
easier, but then he gets hopeful.

762
00:55:12,717 --> 00:55:14,810
-ls that your foot?
-Sorry.

763
00:55:15,887 --> 00:55:17,582
Pedicure. Hello?

764
00:55:17,822 --> 00:55:22,191
-So when you're nice, he thinks--
-l can't talk about it right now.

765
00:55:22,393 --> 00:55:26,352
lt's so hard being someone
people just don't get over.

766
00:55:26,898 --> 00:55:30,231
-Tell him l have a headache.
-l won't lie for you.

767
00:55:30,435 --> 00:55:33,632
-You lie for me all the time.
-Not to him.

768
00:55:33,838 --> 00:55:37,069
This is high school all over again.

769
00:55:37,408 --> 00:55:41,640
When you wanted to break up
with a boyfriend, l had to do it.

770
00:55:41,846 --> 00:55:44,076
-You did not.
-Oh, please.

771
00:55:44,282 --> 00:55:48,912
Let's refresh your memory.
Robert Mancuta? Kyle Hassler?

772
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:53,386
Half the lacrosse team?
l was the most hated girl in school.

773
00:55:53,591 --> 00:55:54,580
That's untrue.

774
00:55:54,792 --> 00:55:59,889
My quote in the yearbook was,
''Hey, we have to talk.'' l was hated.

775
00:56:00,098 --> 00:56:01,156
Fine.

776
00:56:01,532 --> 00:56:02,863
Don't go.

777
00:56:03,067 --> 00:56:07,504
Eddie will sit there like an idiot,
and it'll be all your fault.

778
00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:10,339
Whatever.

779
00:56:15,446 --> 00:56:17,004
-How are you?
-Lee.

780
00:56:17,482 --> 00:56:19,347
-Where's the film?
-What?

781
00:56:19,617 --> 00:56:23,246
ln its canister, waiting to be shown,
to go into history.

782
00:56:23,454 --> 00:56:24,682
There is no film.

783
00:56:24,889 --> 00:56:29,258
What have l seen five times that
gave me the best feeling ever?

784
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:32,258
You'll have a great time.
See you later.

785
00:56:32,730 --> 00:56:36,131
We're dead, we're doomed. Thank you.

786
00:56:53,151 --> 00:56:55,483
Look at you. You clean up good.

787
00:56:55,687 --> 00:56:58,053
-Thanks.
-What's going on?

788
00:56:58,256 --> 00:57:03,159
Gwen isn't feeling well,
so she won't make it to dinner.

789
00:57:04,629 --> 00:57:07,462
-She isn't sick.
-Not physically.

790
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:14,165
-l didn't want you to sit, wondering.
-Thanks. Really.

791
00:57:14,372 --> 00:57:17,205
Wanna join me?
Haven't you read the papers?

792
00:57:17,408 --> 00:57:20,969
l'm unstable. Don't let me be alone.
Come on.

793
00:57:21,179 --> 00:57:23,010
-A few minutes.
-Yeah.

794
00:57:25,216 --> 00:57:27,047
We have an understudy.

795
00:57:27,652 --> 00:57:30,120
They never make it easy, do they?

796
00:57:30,822 --> 00:57:32,653
The house phone, please.

797
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:36,820
Thank you.

798
00:57:38,329 --> 00:57:42,095
-Holly Golightly's cottage, please.
-Who's that?

799
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:45,463
Gwen's code name.
From Breakfast at Tiffany's.

800
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:49,504
-What's that?
-lt's a movie, a great movie.

801
00:57:49,707 --> 00:57:51,937
-Hepburn?
-Right. Katharine.

802
00:57:54,379 --> 00:57:55,869
Listen to me.

803
00:57:56,080 --> 00:58:00,483
Don't tell anyone you're in the
movie business, okay? Thank you.

804
00:58:00,885 --> 00:58:03,012
Hello? Hey, Gwen, it's Lee.

805
00:58:03,221 --> 00:58:06,622
l'm at the restaurant,
and guess what? You're not.

806
00:58:06,824 --> 00:58:09,725
Are you okay? Oh, that's too bad.

807
00:58:09,927 --> 00:58:12,896
Eddie's with Kiki.
She looks unbelievable.

808
00:58:13,331 --> 00:58:15,595
lt's a bit ''Hello, Young Lovers.''

809
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:19,736
l may have some fires to put out,
but that's my problem.

810
00:58:19,937 --> 00:58:22,997
Have a nice night.
Feel better. Okay. Bye.

811
00:58:23,307 --> 00:58:24,296
Five minutes.

812
00:58:24,509 --> 00:58:26,500
-You're amazing.
-Take notes.

813
00:58:26,844 --> 00:58:28,505
''This is Larry Flange.

814
00:58:28,713 --> 00:58:32,410
l'm sitting with the lovely
and talented Kiki Harrison.

815
00:58:32,617 --> 00:58:35,916
You play a lesbian firefighter
on an oil rig.

816
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:39,521
One word comes to mind: Typecasting.
Your thoughts?''

817
00:58:39,724 --> 00:58:41,885
You really want my thoughts?

818
00:58:43,528 --> 00:58:44,722
-Larry.
-Larry.

819
00:58:45,229 --> 00:58:46,560
''Okay, Larry...

820
00:58:46,864 --> 00:58:48,229
...the truth is...

821
00:58:51,069 --> 00:58:53,629
...after playing Madame Curie...

822
00:58:54,272 --> 00:58:56,467
...and discovering radium...

823
00:58:57,208 --> 00:59:02,009
...l just thought it would be a hoot
to strap on those big rubber boots...

824
00:59:02,213 --> 00:59:06,445
...kiss my favorite gal goodbye
and go fight some fire.''

825
00:59:06,818 --> 00:59:10,754
-A very personal role for you.
-Very close to my heart.

826
00:59:10,955 --> 00:59:14,015
-That's funny. You're funny.
-l am. Yeah.

827
00:59:15,093 --> 00:59:18,790
Do you remember Silent Run?
We rented that go-cart?

828
00:59:18,996 --> 00:59:20,964
You attacked the director--

829
00:59:21,165 --> 00:59:25,158
-There was no attacking.
-You rammed him repeatedly.

830
00:59:25,369 --> 00:59:28,964
-You rammed me.
-Ramming you was a different thing.

831
00:59:29,173 --> 00:59:34,406
And you rammed Gwen.
She was not laughing, and we were.

832
00:59:34,612 --> 00:59:37,240
-She wasn't happy.
-She was pissed.

833
00:59:37,982 --> 00:59:42,180
-That memory kept popping in my head.
-Those were good times.

834
00:59:46,090 --> 00:59:50,288
-l'm sorry l didn't call you.
-She's your sister. l understand.

835
00:59:50,495 --> 00:59:54,056
But you're my friend.
l let myself get kind of--

836
00:59:54,265 --> 00:59:57,860
-lt's good to see you now.
-lt's good to see you now.

837
00:59:59,070 --> 01:00:00,970
That's a nice necklace.

838
01:00:01,839 --> 01:00:04,774
-lt's not really mine.
-l know.

839
01:00:04,976 --> 01:00:07,274
-lt's Gwen's.
-l know.

840
01:00:07,478 --> 01:00:10,879
-She gave it to me.
-And l gave it to her.

841
01:00:12,950 --> 01:00:14,178
l know.

842
01:00:14,886 --> 01:00:17,980
-lt looks good on you, though.
-Thank you.

843
01:00:20,124 --> 01:00:21,682
What are you thinking?

844
01:00:21,893 --> 01:00:26,023
l'm thinking something
l shouldn't be thinking about.

845
01:00:26,230 --> 01:00:31,429
-Me too. What were you thinking about?
-How much l want that breadstick.

846
01:00:31,636 --> 01:00:33,536
You want to eat this?

847
01:00:33,738 --> 01:00:37,265
No, l don't eat bread.
l just dream about bread.

848
01:00:37,475 --> 01:00:41,536
l've been doing a lot of
dream analysis since l cracked up--

849
01:00:41,746 --> 01:00:44,874
-At the center.
-At the center. And l believe...

850
01:00:45,516 --> 01:00:50,544
...bread represents something you want
but can't have. What do you think?

851
01:00:50,755 --> 01:00:55,055
Well, l think that
when l dream about bread...

852
01:00:55,259 --> 01:00:57,250
...that would represent...

853
01:00:58,829 --> 01:00:59,955
...bread.

854
01:01:00,765 --> 01:01:02,164
Pretty much.

855
01:01:03,834 --> 01:01:05,927
What are you thinking about?

856
01:01:06,971 --> 01:01:07,960
Gwen...

857
01:01:09,907 --> 01:01:10,931
...is here.

858
01:01:13,611 --> 01:01:15,408
Sorry l'm late.

859
01:01:15,613 --> 01:01:18,946
-Thought you were ill.
-All better. Just like that.

860
01:01:19,150 --> 01:01:23,086
-Thanks. You can go.
-She doesn't have to go.

861
01:01:23,287 --> 01:01:24,982
-Stay.
-Good to see you.

862
01:01:25,189 --> 01:01:27,623
-l need mouthwash.
-Right away.

863
01:01:28,793 --> 01:01:30,317
So....

864
01:01:30,528 --> 01:01:33,463
l hear they have
great pork tenderloin.

865
01:01:33,664 --> 01:01:37,725
-She didn't have to go.
-Thank you. You look great too.

866
01:01:43,541 --> 01:01:47,272
-Excuse me. ls Holly Golightly here?
-What's the name?

867
01:01:49,013 --> 01:01:52,005
-What's he doing here?
-l'll get rid of him.

868
01:01:52,216 --> 01:01:55,549
Get a camera.
Film, tape, anything. Go!

869
01:01:55,753 --> 01:01:57,653
lt's Gwen Harrison.

870
01:01:57,888 --> 01:02:00,948
-Lee. We met the other day.
-Where is Gwen?

871
01:02:01,158 --> 01:02:03,956
-l want to see her.
-l won't get involved.

872
01:02:04,161 --> 01:02:06,527
How do we stop people in love?

873
01:02:06,731 --> 01:02:10,167
What are you talking about?
l want to see her now.

874
01:02:10,368 --> 01:02:14,395
l can't cover for them anymore.
They're in the restaurant.

875
01:02:14,605 --> 01:02:18,200
They're right over there.
She's in the red dress.

876
01:02:22,947 --> 01:02:24,380
-Hi.
-Hector!

877
01:02:25,950 --> 01:02:27,110
Jesus.

878
01:02:27,318 --> 01:02:29,252
-That's all right.
-Hi, Gene.

879
01:02:29,453 --> 01:02:33,287
-Don't wave at him like that.
-l promote my movies.

880
01:02:33,491 --> 01:02:36,016
-l know.
-lt's part of the biz.

881
01:02:36,227 --> 01:02:37,524
l apologize.

882
01:02:37,728 --> 01:02:39,161
-l'm sorry.
-Hector.

883
01:02:39,363 --> 01:02:41,695
-l apologize for him too.
-He's here.

884
01:02:41,899 --> 01:02:44,697
For why are you sitting with him?

885
01:02:45,136 --> 01:02:48,037
Get in. Would you get out of the way?

886
01:02:49,340 --> 01:02:52,241
Good. Get that side. Let's go.

887
01:02:52,443 --> 01:02:55,970
-What are you doing?
-Protecting the woman l love.

888
01:02:56,414 --> 01:03:00,111
-l'll let you two catch up.
-Why don't you be quiet!

889
01:03:00,318 --> 01:03:02,809
-l'll get to you soon.
-Don't point.

890
01:03:03,154 --> 01:03:04,985
Don't tell me what to do.

891
01:03:06,524 --> 01:03:10,016
-Don't you trust me?
-l trust you implicitly.

892
01:03:10,227 --> 01:03:13,458
lt's this asshole l don't trust!

893
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,865
What? What did you say?

894
01:03:19,603 --> 01:03:22,333
l hope he's not
making fun of my accent.

895
01:03:22,540 --> 01:03:26,636
Okay, enough! You guys enjoy
your little public display!

896
01:03:26,844 --> 01:03:27,833
l'm leaving.

897
01:03:28,379 --> 01:03:30,745
Okay, pussy boy's leaving.

898
01:03:31,015 --> 01:03:33,609
What's wrong? You don't like that?

899
01:03:33,818 --> 01:03:36,412
Maybe you want to take a swing at me?

900
01:03:36,754 --> 01:03:38,551
Tall boy. Come on.

901
01:03:39,056 --> 01:03:40,387
What are you--?

902
01:03:41,559 --> 01:03:44,756
-What is that?
-Let's go. Please, make my day.

903
01:03:46,630 --> 01:03:49,997
You're a genius,
beyond my wildest expectations.

904
01:03:50,201 --> 01:03:53,659
Tracking's up.
Spielberg's moved off our date.

905
01:03:54,405 --> 01:03:56,703
This is good! Hit him! Hit him!

906
01:03:56,907 --> 01:03:58,374
-Who?
-Anybody.

907
01:03:58,576 --> 01:04:00,908
-l won't fight!
-You're a pussy boy.

908
01:04:01,178 --> 01:04:06,206
-l'm trying to find some peace.
-You want peace? Okay, he wants peace.

909
01:04:06,917 --> 01:04:09,579
-Pussy boy's leaving.
-Don't do that.

910
01:04:09,787 --> 01:04:12,984
-Hector, don't.
-Don't tell me ''don't.''

911
01:04:13,190 --> 01:04:15,385
Maybe you want a piece of me.

912
01:04:16,660 --> 01:04:17,649
You see?

913
01:04:19,697 --> 01:04:21,255
Huh, pussy?

914
01:04:21,465 --> 01:04:26,095
l really don't think there should be
a problem here. After all...

915
01:04:26,303 --> 01:04:29,795
...you took my wife and l tried
to kill you. We're even.

916
01:04:30,007 --> 01:04:31,804
You crumpled duck!

917
01:04:33,711 --> 01:04:35,679
Oh! Dear me!

918
01:04:40,050 --> 01:04:41,244
Go away!

919
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:46,653
Punk! You hungry?
Eat this, punk! Eat it!

920
01:04:47,091 --> 01:04:48,615
Are you hungry?!

921
01:04:52,596 --> 01:04:54,359
l love your work.

922
01:05:03,073 --> 01:05:04,631
You forgot something.

923
01:05:07,812 --> 01:05:10,508
-Did you see him go down?
-Shut up.

924
01:05:10,848 --> 01:05:14,579
-Why'd you have to do that?
-l didn't have to. l wanted to.

925
01:05:14,785 --> 01:05:18,221
-Just deal with it. ln there.
-lt was my pleasure.

926
01:05:21,425 --> 01:05:22,722
Did you see that?

927
01:05:26,664 --> 01:05:29,258
-Are you okay?
-Everybody back, please.

928
01:05:30,901 --> 01:05:32,630
Eddie! Are you okay?

929
01:05:32,837 --> 01:05:37,001
l can feel my nose in the back
of my throat. ls that bad?

930
01:05:37,208 --> 01:05:38,698
Can you hear me?

931
01:05:40,010 --> 01:05:42,979
-Let's all just step back.
-Some ice, please.

932
01:05:43,247 --> 01:05:46,512
l swear to God,
Gwen can be just horrible.

933
01:05:46,717 --> 01:05:51,848
How can you love someone and not like
them at the same time? Seems strange.

934
01:05:52,289 --> 01:05:54,883
-You need to lie down.
-l thought l was.

935
01:05:55,092 --> 01:05:59,119
Why don't we try sitting down?
There we go.

936
01:05:59,864 --> 01:06:01,695
Let me have a look.

937
01:06:02,900 --> 01:06:04,800
-lt doesn't look good.
-No?

938
01:06:05,002 --> 01:06:06,264
Cold.

939
01:06:08,038 --> 01:06:11,565
-What happened?
-l needed another humiliating photo op.

940
01:06:12,409 --> 01:06:15,207
l tried to walk away,
but he kept pushing.

941
01:06:15,412 --> 01:06:19,746
So l hit him in the tray with my face.
l should've walked away.

942
01:06:19,950 --> 01:06:23,909
For some reason, these days,
l do the stupid thing.

943
01:06:24,822 --> 01:06:26,949
This doesn't look good.

944
01:06:55,052 --> 01:06:58,112
-What was that?
-Another stupid thing.

945
01:06:58,656 --> 01:07:02,490
Stupid and maybe verging
on crazy or...?

946
01:07:03,127 --> 01:07:04,651
lt's a fine....

947
01:07:08,832 --> 01:07:11,801
There he is. The master!

948
01:07:12,169 --> 01:07:14,103
l'll have what he's having.

949
01:07:14,305 --> 01:07:18,639
l have to say, you have
completely outdone yourself.

950
01:07:18,842 --> 01:07:22,005
ln 24 hours, we've had
a walk in the woods...

951
01:07:22,212 --> 01:07:24,612
...a romantic dinner and a fistfight.

952
01:07:24,815 --> 01:07:27,477
l can't wait to see what happens next.

953
01:07:28,619 --> 01:07:32,453
Maybe l can get him to commit suicide.
You like that?

954
01:07:34,158 --> 01:07:36,149
Let me think about it.

955
01:07:37,328 --> 01:07:41,628
lt won't help initial release
but video will go like crazy.

956
01:07:41,832 --> 01:07:46,326
-We could do a box like a coffin.
-Yeah. That's good. No, wait.

957
01:07:47,037 --> 01:07:51,371
lmagine if he killed himself
at the premiere.

958
01:07:54,678 --> 01:07:58,409
l'm joking.
l'm thinking out loud or whatever.

959
01:07:59,049 --> 01:08:01,745
-Good night, Dave.
-Good night, Lee.

960
01:08:05,522 --> 01:08:06,921
Good work!

961
01:08:29,747 --> 01:08:31,840
Good morning.

962
01:08:34,585 --> 01:08:35,711
How do you feel?

963
01:08:35,919 --> 01:08:37,944
l feel-- l feel--

964
01:08:38,155 --> 01:08:42,717
l feel good. l mean,
l feel weird, but l feel good.

965
01:08:42,926 --> 01:08:45,918
-You?
-l feel something along those lines.

966
01:08:46,864 --> 01:08:48,764
Good, weird. Weird, good.

967
01:08:49,366 --> 01:08:53,234
Here's what l was thinking.
What about breakfast?

968
01:08:53,871 --> 01:08:55,839
We'll take it from there.

969
01:08:58,742 --> 01:09:03,338
Why don't you order some breakfast?
l'll brush my teeth first.

970
01:09:03,781 --> 01:09:07,478
-Can l use your toothbrush?
-Yeah, it's in there.

971
01:09:14,191 --> 01:09:16,284
Can l get some juice?

972
01:09:18,495 --> 01:09:20,019
Keek? Hello?

973
01:09:20,297 --> 01:09:22,026
Where are you?

974
01:09:26,003 --> 01:09:27,493
Want some toast?

975
01:09:29,973 --> 01:09:31,702
You buttered my toast.

976
01:09:33,077 --> 01:09:34,874
No one's done that before.

977
01:09:35,079 --> 01:09:38,776
l don't eat toast with butter--
l don't eat toast.

978
01:09:38,982 --> 01:09:42,247
l'll stop talking now
and make an exception.

979
01:09:42,453 --> 01:09:44,011
Want some tea?

980
01:09:47,658 --> 01:09:48,716
lt's hot.

981
01:09:48,959 --> 01:09:51,154
-Here. Okay.
-Thank you.

982
01:09:56,400 --> 01:10:00,564
No, l'm fine. l look like
half a raccoon. What's up?

983
01:10:00,971 --> 01:10:03,906
Now's not a good time.
Can we do it later?

984
01:10:04,108 --> 01:10:06,941
No, don't come here. l'll come there.

985
01:10:07,311 --> 01:10:08,300
Bye.

986
01:10:09,313 --> 01:10:10,712
That was Gwen.

987
01:10:11,014 --> 01:10:13,380
-She wants to talk.
-About what?

988
01:10:13,584 --> 01:10:16,576
l don't know, she didn't say.
But l better...

989
01:10:16,787 --> 01:10:21,656
-...go over there.
-Why didn't you say you'd talk later?

990
01:10:21,859 --> 01:10:24,953
She said she'd come here,
and l thought...

991
01:10:25,162 --> 01:10:30,498
...that's not a good idea so l better
go over there, given the situation.

992
01:10:30,701 --> 01:10:35,832
-Will you tell her about last night?
-l don't know. l'll just let her talk.

993
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:38,432
Know what l mean?

994
01:10:38,642 --> 01:10:42,237
Sounds like it's important
so l'll let her say it.

995
01:10:42,446 --> 01:10:45,347
Then l'll go do these dumb interviews.

996
01:10:45,549 --> 01:10:49,883
l'll come back and we'll lunch
together. Does that sound good?

997
01:11:09,773 --> 01:11:11,604
You look terrible.

998
01:11:11,942 --> 01:11:14,638
-Does it hurt?
-Only when l'm awake.

999
01:11:15,612 --> 01:11:17,170
-He's not here.
-Who?

1000
01:11:17,381 --> 01:11:20,544
-Hector.
-That doesn't matter. ls Kiki here?

1001
01:11:20,751 --> 01:11:22,048
l doubt it.

1002
01:11:26,290 --> 01:11:30,021
-l don't know where that girl is.
-That girl is here.

1003
01:11:31,695 --> 01:11:35,426
Nice of you to join us.
Where have you been?

1004
01:11:35,632 --> 01:11:38,829
Got up early. Things to do.
Nothing important.

1005
01:11:40,037 --> 01:11:44,337
Would you make scrambled eggs?
She makes great scrambled eggs.

1006
01:11:44,541 --> 01:11:47,476
-l remember.
-Would you like some?

1007
01:11:48,145 --> 01:11:51,979
-Two orders. Make mine runny.
-Let's get room service.

1008
01:11:52,182 --> 01:11:54,116
lt would be my pleasure.

1009
01:11:56,987 --> 01:11:59,285
What did you want to talk about?

1010
01:12:00,424 --> 01:12:03,359
l think you're doing pretty well, huh?

1011
01:12:03,560 --> 01:12:06,393
-Are you feeling okay?
-Yeah, l'm better.

1012
01:12:06,597 --> 01:12:08,565
l'm shocking myself.

1013
01:12:09,299 --> 01:12:11,699
''l forgot how charming you were.''

1014
01:12:11,902 --> 01:12:15,929
''You, Miss Julep, are a warm breeze
on a cool afternoon.''

1015
01:12:17,708 --> 01:12:18,697
What was that?

1016
01:12:19,042 --> 01:12:20,703
''what was that?''

1017
01:12:21,745 --> 01:12:23,770
-What movie was that?
-l don't know.

1018
01:12:23,981 --> 01:12:26,541
What was that movie called?

1019
01:12:27,284 --> 01:12:29,047
l don't give a shit!

1020
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:34,780
-No, that wasn't it.
-You look like you're in a good place.

1021
01:12:34,992 --> 01:12:38,450
When l saw you and Hector,
l was so conflicted.

1022
01:12:38,662 --> 01:12:43,156
Conflicted is the word du jour.
There's no question about that.

1023
01:12:44,501 --> 01:12:47,197
You know what that is? She's tired.

1024
01:12:47,404 --> 01:12:49,634
-You seeing anybody?
-Excuse me?

1025
01:12:50,474 --> 01:12:53,773
-Are you seeing anybody?
-Let me think about it.

1026
01:12:56,079 --> 01:12:57,137
Not....

1027
01:13:00,250 --> 01:13:01,615
You know....

1028
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:05,247
-Not technically, no.
-What?

1029
01:13:05,455 --> 01:13:07,013
Not technically!

1030
01:13:11,895 --> 01:13:14,864
That's fascinating. ''Not technically.''

1031
01:13:15,065 --> 01:13:18,626
That's sad. Really, that's a shame.

1032
01:13:19,269 --> 01:13:23,035
Your eggs, darling sister.
l hope they're runny enough.

1033
01:13:23,240 --> 01:13:27,108
And you! Son of a bitch!
Here are your eggs! There you go!

1034
01:13:27,311 --> 01:13:29,506
-What's wrong?
-A lot, actually.

1035
01:13:29,713 --> 01:13:33,114
l can't believe it's taken
so long to figure out.

1036
01:13:33,317 --> 01:13:36,343
l'm going for a long walk
to simmer down.

1037
01:13:36,553 --> 01:13:39,386
First, l'd like to cut
through the shit.

1038
01:13:39,656 --> 01:13:44,650
He's not technically dating because
he's technically hung up on you.

1039
01:13:44,861 --> 01:13:47,386
And you! You moron!

1040
01:13:47,831 --> 01:13:51,164
She's only here to salvage
her precious career...

1041
01:13:51,368 --> 01:13:54,132
...and serve you with divorce papers.

1042
01:13:54,338 --> 01:13:57,671
l've done all l can do.
l'm going for a walk.

1043
01:13:57,874 --> 01:14:01,833
Leaving is just something
l've really perfected, so...

1044
01:14:02,045 --> 01:14:04,343
...once more, with feeling.

1045
01:14:05,415 --> 01:14:08,851
-She was more fun when she was fat.
-ls that true?

1046
01:14:09,353 --> 01:14:11,082
-What?
-About the papers.

1047
01:14:11,288 --> 01:14:13,051
Yes, but now l don't know.

1048
01:14:13,256 --> 01:14:17,852
Seeing you, being in front of the
press with you-- We have something.

1049
01:14:18,061 --> 01:14:21,622
Maybe l've made a horrible,
horrible mistake.

1050
01:14:21,832 --> 01:14:25,233
Maybe l should give you the papers.
l don't know.

1051
01:14:26,970 --> 01:14:28,767
You're the devil.

1052
01:14:36,780 --> 01:14:40,272
-l want to talk. Hold on a minute.
-Let go of me.

1053
01:14:40,484 --> 01:14:42,384
-l want to talk.
-l don't!

1054
01:14:42,586 --> 01:14:46,317
-Why not?
-You're an idiot. l'm an idiot too!

1055
01:14:46,523 --> 01:14:49,014
ln that respect, we belong together.

1056
01:14:49,226 --> 01:14:53,219
-lt's a complicated situation.
-l'll un-complicate it!

1057
01:14:53,430 --> 01:14:58,333
Forget about what happened between us.
lt's not gonna work, all right?

1058
01:14:58,535 --> 01:15:01,060
Last night? Last night was great.

1059
01:15:01,271 --> 01:15:05,298
But she calls you,
and you can't wait to get to her!

1060
01:15:05,509 --> 01:15:10,071
What is that? lt won't work.
You'll probably always think of her...

1061
01:15:10,280 --> 01:15:14,444
...and l'll probably always wonder
if you're thinking of her.

1062
01:15:14,651 --> 01:15:15,777
l just--

1063
01:15:16,486 --> 01:15:19,148
-l need you to know one thing.
-What?

1064
01:15:19,790 --> 01:15:22,884
That woman that you saw by the pool--

1065
01:15:23,093 --> 01:15:27,257
That woman you just have to spend
the rest of your life with....

1066
01:15:30,033 --> 01:15:31,330
That was me.

1067
01:15:43,980 --> 01:15:45,811
-Good morning.
-Morning.

1068
01:15:46,583 --> 01:15:49,143
So here's the buffet.

1069
01:15:49,386 --> 01:15:50,910
What's going on?

1070
01:15:52,389 --> 01:15:54,880
Nothing. l'm great.

1071
01:15:55,292 --> 01:15:59,319
Just great. Ma'am, can l get
some more butter?

1072
01:16:00,163 --> 01:16:02,723
When you hit Formica, stop.

1073
01:16:02,966 --> 01:16:06,265
You know the expression
''falling off the wagon''?

1074
01:16:06,470 --> 01:16:09,906
But you got 30 pounds of food
to break your fall.

1075
01:16:10,107 --> 01:16:14,510
-What the hell happened?
-Bad morning. Preceded by 33 bad years.

1076
01:16:14,711 --> 01:16:17,874
-Does this have to do with Gwen?
-Of course not.

1077
01:16:18,081 --> 01:16:21,539
l love my sister.
l love everything about her.

1078
01:16:21,751 --> 01:16:24,311
''Kiki? Kiki-kins?

1079
01:16:24,521 --> 01:16:26,716
Who's smoking? l smell smoke.

1080
01:16:26,923 --> 01:16:31,860
ls someone smoking within a six-mile
radius of me? Stop them, Kiki.''

1081
01:16:32,062 --> 01:16:36,999
Oh, ma'am, the butter? There's
no butter? How can you run out?

1082
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:40,169
-l have one theory.
-l need an assistant.

1083
01:16:40,370 --> 01:16:43,806
lf l had one, she'd be outside
milking a cow...

1084
01:16:44,007 --> 01:16:46,874
...and l'd never run out of butter.

1085
01:16:47,744 --> 01:16:51,646
''My butter has touched another food.
l need new butter.''

1086
01:16:52,048 --> 01:16:54,881
''Anything you want.''
That's how it goes.

1087
01:16:55,085 --> 01:16:57,553
You know. Anything they want, right?

1088
01:16:59,756 --> 01:17:03,658
She's got a green dress.
Looks like crap on her.

1089
01:17:03,994 --> 01:17:08,522
Brings out the bags under her eyes.
She gave it to me. lt looks nice.

1090
01:17:08,732 --> 01:17:11,223
Then she said she wanted it back.

1091
01:17:11,668 --> 01:17:14,899
She doesn't want me to have it.

1092
01:17:15,505 --> 01:17:17,769
So you're in love with Eddie?

1093
01:17:19,442 --> 01:17:23,674
-Wouldn't that be stupid?
-l've done every one of their movies.

1094
01:17:23,880 --> 01:17:27,145
He never looks at her
the way he looks at you.

1095
01:17:27,350 --> 01:17:32,686
lf you're in love, just go for it.
The way you went for this breakfast.

1096
01:17:33,657 --> 01:17:37,115
Not the way you went
for the breakfast. That's--

1097
01:17:42,399 --> 01:17:46,062
l think l'm gonna be sick.
Can you just....

1098
01:17:53,810 --> 01:17:58,713
l'll take all of this to go.
l'll need 30 bags and a forklift.

1099
01:18:00,917 --> 01:18:02,646
No laugh, no tip.

1100
01:18:25,175 --> 01:18:28,110
l want to play someone
like the Terminator.

1101
01:18:28,311 --> 01:18:31,747
l think the Hispanic people
are crying out to see...

1102
01:18:31,948 --> 01:18:35,816
...a deadly, destructive
killing machine they can embrace.

1103
01:18:36,019 --> 01:18:39,284
-That they can relate to.
-Nice to see you.

1104
01:18:39,489 --> 01:18:44,756
How are you? Hal here yet?
He's a dead man. No, l'm serious.

1105
01:18:44,961 --> 01:18:49,261
l know a guy. l'll make a call,
and he's dead, because....

1106
01:18:49,466 --> 01:18:53,027
How are you?
Hope you're having a good time.

1107
01:18:53,270 --> 01:18:54,862
-What time is it?
-1 2:50.

1108
01:18:55,071 --> 01:18:56,265
We're doomed.

1109
01:18:56,473 --> 01:19:01,308
May l suggest that you follow my lead
and get completely shitfaced?

1110
01:19:01,511 --> 01:19:05,880
-Hi, how are you? You look gorgeous.
-Hi, Mr. K. Thank you.

1111
01:19:06,082 --> 01:19:10,348
How long must l stay with the people?
They're drunk and touching me.

1112
01:19:10,553 --> 01:19:15,581
Wait. lf Hal doesn't bring the film,
they'll be busy building a gallows.

1113
01:19:15,792 --> 01:19:17,817
l don't think that's funny.

1114
01:19:22,632 --> 01:19:23,826
ls that pussy boy?

1115
01:19:28,805 --> 01:19:30,830
-He's gonna jump.
-He's not.

1116
01:19:31,041 --> 01:19:35,273
-l said l'd give him divorce papers.
-Shit, he's gonna jump!

1117
01:19:35,845 --> 01:19:37,472
-Excuse me.
-Please.

1118
01:19:37,681 --> 01:19:39,478
-l'll do something.
-Get him!

1119
01:19:39,683 --> 01:19:42,618
Let's take advantage of this.
Get some shots.

1120
01:19:42,819 --> 01:19:45,049
-Shut up.
-All right, yeah. Okay.

1121
01:19:45,689 --> 01:19:47,953
-Jump, jump.
-Jump, pussy, jump.

1122
01:19:48,158 --> 01:19:51,059
-Jump, pussy, jump.
-l can't believe this.

1123
01:19:54,331 --> 01:19:56,959
-He'll be a pussy pancake.
-l'm coming!

1124
01:20:04,841 --> 01:20:06,308
Why's he doing this to me?

1125
01:20:06,509 --> 01:20:09,205
-l'm sorry! You okay?
-What are you doing?

1126
01:20:09,412 --> 01:20:12,848
-l was stopping you from jumping!
-By killing me?!

1127
01:20:13,483 --> 01:20:16,782
-Stay right there!
-Where am l gonna go?

1128
01:20:16,986 --> 01:20:18,112
Right!

1129
01:20:21,391 --> 01:20:23,951
Oh, shit. Hang in there, Eddie!

1130
01:20:24,794 --> 01:20:25,988
l'm coming!

1131
01:20:28,932 --> 01:20:30,559
-Okay.
-You're hosing me down?

1132
01:20:30,767 --> 01:20:35,431
l'll throw it, and you catch it.
One, two, three.

1133
01:20:39,909 --> 01:20:43,504
Pull yourself up. l got you.
Come on.

1134
01:20:44,581 --> 01:20:46,208
Got it? Good.

1135
01:20:49,185 --> 01:20:51,176
Oh, my God!

1136
01:20:53,223 --> 01:20:54,690
Pussy boy'll go splat.

1137
01:20:54,924 --> 01:20:56,653
-Got it?
-Yeah.

1138
01:20:57,727 --> 01:21:00,252
That's it. One foot at a time.

1139
01:21:02,499 --> 01:21:04,194
-Okay.
-l'm gonna kill you.

1140
01:21:04,401 --> 01:21:07,165
Take a bow. lt'll look better.

1141
01:21:13,610 --> 01:21:15,100
Jesus Christ.

1142
01:21:18,848 --> 01:21:21,783
Next time, take
a hair dryer into the tub.

1143
01:21:21,985 --> 01:21:24,613
-l wasn't killing myself.
-Then what?

1144
01:21:25,054 --> 01:21:27,955
l came here to think. ls that a crime?

1145
01:21:28,158 --> 01:21:29,750
Do that in your room!

1146
01:21:33,463 --> 01:21:35,124
l blew it.

1147
01:21:36,132 --> 01:21:37,121
l lost her.

1148
01:21:39,269 --> 01:21:40,896
Guy goes to his rabbi.

1149
01:21:41,104 --> 01:21:44,403
He says, ''Rabbi, my wife
is trying to poison me.''

1150
01:21:44,607 --> 01:21:46,734
Rabbi says, ''l'll talk to her.''

1151
01:21:46,943 --> 01:21:51,175
He comes back and says,
''l spoke to your wife for three hours.

1152
01:21:51,381 --> 01:21:52,575
Take the poison.''

1153
01:21:53,550 --> 01:21:58,044
-You get it? You and Gwen are over.
-l don't care about Gwen!

1154
01:21:58,254 --> 01:22:00,245
-l'm talking about Kiki.
-Kiki?

1155
01:22:00,457 --> 01:22:05,019
She's the only one worth spending
any time with in this hellhole.

1156
01:22:05,361 --> 01:22:08,455
No offense.
You have some nice qualities.

1157
01:22:08,665 --> 01:22:11,532
But for a review,
you'd sell me for medicine.

1158
01:22:11,734 --> 01:22:14,032
-Don't let her get away.
-Too late.

1159
01:22:14,237 --> 01:22:17,035
No, it's not. Trust me.
l'm telling you--

1160
01:22:21,878 --> 01:22:23,175
-That's Hal!
-lt is?

1161
01:22:23,379 --> 01:22:26,007
He's here with the film! We're saved!

1162
01:22:26,216 --> 01:22:29,208
-We're beyond saving.
-You wanna see the film?

1163
01:22:29,419 --> 01:22:32,582
-l don't care.
-This could put you back on top.

1164
01:22:32,789 --> 01:22:36,350
-You think? On top?
-''May l have the envelope, please?''

1165
01:22:37,927 --> 01:22:40,487
Hal! lt's Hal. Hal!

1166
01:22:46,302 --> 01:22:50,033
-He's got the film. Go, go.
-He's the director.

1167
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:52,606
-He looks good.
-He looks great.

1168
01:22:57,313 --> 01:23:02,080
Let's get started. l'm Lee Phillips.
Welcome to Time Over Time.

1169
01:23:02,552 --> 01:23:03,814
Thank you.

1170
01:23:04,988 --> 01:23:07,616
l'll go out on a ledge here
and say....

1171
01:23:08,758 --> 01:23:10,623
l couldn't help myself.

1172
01:23:10,994 --> 01:23:15,055
Welcome the man responsible
for this junket, Dave Kingman.

1173
01:23:17,567 --> 01:23:19,034
Thank you very much.

1174
01:23:19,736 --> 01:23:24,139
They say that good things come
to those who wait.

1175
01:23:24,340 --> 01:23:27,969
l waited 20 years to work
with the great Hal Weidmann.

1176
01:23:28,177 --> 01:23:33,114
-Hal's cinematic influence has been--
-That's good. Thank you.

1177
01:23:33,316 --> 01:23:34,681
Thank you.

1178
01:23:36,252 --> 01:23:38,686
My name is Hal Weidmann. Hello.

1179
01:23:42,592 --> 01:23:44,617
Ladies and gentlemen...

1180
01:23:44,827 --> 01:23:49,264
...this is the most honest movie
l have ever made.

1181
01:23:49,966 --> 01:23:54,403
l wasn't looking for it. lt came
to me like a bus in the street.

1182
01:23:54,604 --> 01:23:59,735
Or the woman who changes
the flowers at our desert house.

1183
01:24:00,743 --> 01:24:04,372
l can't talk about this film
without weeping. Roll it.

1184
01:24:04,681 --> 01:24:07,980
Thank you, Hal.
Have a great time, everybody!

1185
01:24:26,903 --> 01:24:29,201
Sarah. l'm Ben. we must speak.

1186
01:24:29,405 --> 01:24:31,498
-who are you?
-That's unimportant.

1187
01:24:31,708 --> 01:24:35,610
what's important now is yoursafety.
You're in danger.

1188
01:24:35,812 --> 01:24:38,610
This is hard to say,
so l'lljust say it.

1189
01:24:38,815 --> 01:24:41,375
-l'm from the future.
-Oh, my God!

1190
01:24:42,018 --> 01:24:44,418
-You look beautiful.
-Thank you.

1191
01:24:44,621 --> 01:24:47,351
Come with me now. Now, Sarah, please.

1192
01:24:51,527 --> 01:24:54,792
Love is a bridge
built between two people.

1193
01:24:54,998 --> 01:25:00,061
we want what exists
between them to be real.

1194
01:25:00,370 --> 01:25:02,463
My name is Hal weidmann.

1195
01:25:02,672 --> 01:25:07,575
The film you're about to see
is Time Over Time, oris it?

1196
01:25:08,211 --> 01:25:11,009
The details are unimportant.
Simplyput...

1197
01:25:11,214 --> 01:25:14,012
...the script was shit. l tossed it.

1198
01:25:14,217 --> 01:25:18,051
-l let my camera capture real life.
-Just watch.

1199
01:25:19,956 --> 01:25:23,187
l filmed my actors
without theirknowledge.

1200
01:25:23,393 --> 01:25:27,796
l let the camera run after takes.
l placed hidden cameras around.

1201
01:25:27,997 --> 01:25:31,160
And the end result is a story...

1202
01:25:31,367 --> 01:25:36,634
...farmore involving than anything
manufactured by actors and writers.

1203
01:25:39,275 --> 01:25:41,402
This is real life.

1204
01:25:41,644 --> 01:25:43,271
Thejuice.

1205
01:25:43,880 --> 01:25:45,313
The stink.

1206
01:25:47,417 --> 01:25:48,441
The glory.

1207
01:25:55,558 --> 01:25:58,459
Often, you wonder
where the budget goes.

1208
01:25:58,661 --> 01:26:00,253
Shut up!

1209
01:26:04,367 --> 01:26:06,062
lt's gonna be good.

1210
01:26:06,402 --> 01:26:09,997
l don't mean to pressure you,
but we're 15 days over.

1211
01:26:10,239 --> 01:26:13,174
-Oh, no.
-what are we gonna do?

1212
01:26:13,376 --> 01:26:17,904
l'm in the middle ofshooting.
lt's a sensitive time. Do me a favor.

1213
01:26:18,114 --> 01:26:22,107
Go away. Please.
Never visit my set again.

1214
01:26:25,588 --> 01:26:27,112
Watch him take it...

1215
01:26:27,323 --> 01:26:28,984
...up the gazoo.

1216
01:26:30,993 --> 01:26:35,293
You're an idiot. l told you
we nevershould've hired him.

1217
01:27:19,675 --> 01:27:21,802
You're so good in this.

1218
01:27:27,283 --> 01:27:28,341
Cut.

1219
01:27:31,020 --> 01:27:34,979
-Hal, can l get like three minutes?
-Three minutes.

1220
01:27:35,191 --> 01:27:37,955
-Gwen, can l talk to you?
-l'm working.

1221
01:27:41,697 --> 01:27:43,790
-what's going on?
-Nothing.

1222
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:48,494
-His hands are all overyourass.
-My character would've done that.

1223
01:27:48,704 --> 01:27:51,730
-You look like a prostitute!
-Oh, please.

1224
01:27:51,941 --> 01:27:54,409
-Don't make a fool ofme.
-Cut it out.

1225
01:27:54,610 --> 01:27:57,511
l'm watching you every minute.
You hearme?

1226
01:27:57,713 --> 01:28:00,807
-Cut it out.
-Do you hearme?!

1227
01:28:04,387 --> 01:28:07,584
-l think Eddie knows.
-Knows what?

1228
01:28:08,391 --> 01:28:10,052
About me and Hector.

1229
01:28:10,927 --> 01:28:15,193
-You said nothing was happening.
-well, something happened.

1230
01:28:19,669 --> 01:28:20,897
You see thatzit?

1231
01:28:22,405 --> 01:28:25,306
-What the hell is this?
-You think l know?

1232
01:28:26,409 --> 01:28:27,398
You bastard!

1233
01:28:27,844 --> 01:28:30,039
-You see it?
-l'll get something.

1234
01:28:30,613 --> 01:28:33,673
-l slept with him.
-Hector?.

1235
01:28:35,017 --> 01:28:36,951
-Are you in love?
-Come on.

1236
01:28:37,153 --> 01:28:41,112
lt's not always about love.
Sometimes youjust need a lay.

1237
01:28:44,026 --> 01:28:46,153
l tell you, he's hot.

1238
01:28:46,495 --> 01:28:49,464
Handsome. He can go forhours.

1239
01:28:50,633 --> 01:28:54,034
Just wish he had a bigger,
you know, thingy.

1240
01:28:56,706 --> 01:28:58,003
l love this movie.

1241
01:28:58,207 --> 01:28:59,868
what do you mean?

1242
01:29:00,409 --> 01:29:04,709
lt's like a roll of quarters.
lt's like this.

1243
01:29:07,383 --> 01:29:11,217
-well, maybe like this.
-Okay. l know too much.

1244
01:29:15,258 --> 01:29:16,782
l'm gonna scream.

1245
01:29:16,993 --> 01:29:20,724
-l think it's very entertaining.
-Lee, get over here!

1246
01:29:22,365 --> 01:29:25,459
You stop this right now.
l'll sue the studio.

1247
01:29:25,668 --> 01:29:27,795
-Lower your voice.
-Shut up.

1248
01:29:28,004 --> 01:29:30,973
-Cut the film.
-Excuse me. Was that deserved?

1249
01:29:31,173 --> 01:29:34,939
l think so. You've ruined me.
You've ruined my career.

1250
01:29:35,144 --> 01:29:38,739
Look at the screen.
Don't you realize what that is?

1251
01:29:38,948 --> 01:29:41,382
That's reinvention. That's birth.

1252
01:29:41,584 --> 01:29:44,849
That's life itself.
Can't you smell the life?

1253
01:29:45,254 --> 01:29:48,655
Pretty soon you'll smell
lra Stern, my attorney!

1254
01:29:49,892 --> 01:29:51,883
-Thank you, Hal.
-Wacko.

1255
01:29:52,428 --> 01:29:57,127
The film's new direction caught
some of us a little bit off-guard.

1256
01:29:57,733 --> 01:30:01,328
-l am shocked. l'm outraged.
-There are textures!

1257
01:30:01,537 --> 01:30:03,732
Can l say something, please?

1258
01:30:03,940 --> 01:30:08,036
What was said about my penis
is completely false.

1259
01:30:08,244 --> 01:30:11,975
l'm extremely well-hung.
l'll submit to an inspection.

1260
01:30:12,181 --> 01:30:15,014
l knew this film
would be misunderstood.

1261
01:30:15,217 --> 01:30:17,913
Kubrick was misunderstood. Godard.

1262
01:30:18,120 --> 01:30:20,714
l'll kick your ass! Understand that!

1263
01:30:20,923 --> 01:30:22,982
-Who are you?
-Who am l?

1264
01:30:23,192 --> 01:30:26,025
-l'm your ass-kicker!
-Can l defend my dad?

1265
01:30:26,228 --> 01:30:28,128
No. Who's her dad?

1266
01:30:28,497 --> 01:30:30,124
-Hal.
-No, you cannot!

1267
01:30:30,333 --> 01:30:32,665
Let me defend Hector. We had sex.

1268
01:30:32,868 --> 01:30:35,860
His penis is bigger
than a roll of quarters.

1269
01:30:36,072 --> 01:30:37,664
-You slept with her?
-No.

1270
01:30:37,873 --> 01:30:40,740
-You slept with her?
-l swear she's lying.

1271
01:30:40,943 --> 01:30:45,380
The part about my penis is true.
lt's bigger than coins.

1272
01:30:45,581 --> 01:30:50,883
There will be a lawsuit. lnvasion
of privacy, damage to my career!

1273
01:30:51,087 --> 01:30:52,486
Yes, yes, l know.

1274
01:30:53,055 --> 01:30:55,819
Congratulations.
lt's my most honest work.

1275
01:30:56,025 --> 01:30:58,357
-l'll work with you.
-l got a script.

1276
01:30:58,561 --> 01:31:00,256
-You're great.
-l'll send it.

1277
01:31:00,463 --> 01:31:05,332
l have an announcement to make.
l'd like to thank you all.

1278
01:31:05,534 --> 01:31:09,402
l'm so happy you're here
and all our friends in the press...

1279
01:31:09,605 --> 01:31:14,941
...who've been so supportive
this last year. l'm so happy to say...

1280
01:31:15,811 --> 01:31:18,803
...that Eddie and l are getting
back together.

1281
01:31:23,786 --> 01:31:26,118
So thank you all so much.

1282
01:31:26,322 --> 01:31:28,984
-What is this bullshit now?
-Be quiet.

1283
01:31:29,191 --> 01:31:31,421
This is bullshit. Bullshit!

1284
01:31:31,627 --> 01:31:34,061
Today, Eddie came to the cottage.

1285
01:31:34,263 --> 01:31:37,994
We had breakfast and a heartfelt talk,
didn't we, honey?

1286
01:31:38,200 --> 01:31:40,964
l've wanted to get back
together with Gwen...

1287
01:31:41,170 --> 01:31:45,607
...ever since we weren't together
anymore. l've obsessed about it.

1288
01:31:45,808 --> 01:31:49,710
-How sweet.
-Now that it's happened, l must say...

1289
01:31:49,912 --> 01:31:54,542
...l'm amazed and grateful. And l
agree with Hector that it's bullshit.

1290
01:31:54,750 --> 01:31:56,479
Thank you very much!

1291
01:31:56,952 --> 01:31:58,579
-We talked about this.
-No.

1292
01:31:58,788 --> 01:32:01,621
-We did. Don't you love me?
-We did not.

1293
01:32:01,824 --> 01:32:04,918
l love the bright,
sexy woman up on-screen.

1294
01:32:05,127 --> 01:32:06,822
-He loves me.
-The movie girl.

1295
01:32:07,029 --> 01:32:11,125
That's not you. You're good
at pretending to be real.

1296
01:32:11,333 --> 01:32:14,734
l think l'm with
the real you, but l'm not.

1297
01:32:14,970 --> 01:32:19,430
l'm with the real you,
not the movie you. l don't want that.

1298
01:32:19,642 --> 01:32:21,269
-Why?
-l just explained it.

1299
01:32:21,477 --> 01:32:23,604
-You did?
-l don't want to talk.

1300
01:32:23,813 --> 01:32:26,304
-Not in front of these--
-Why not?

1301
01:32:26,515 --> 01:32:30,542
What could l have to say to you
that l don't have to say...

1302
01:32:30,753 --> 01:32:34,211
...in front of 300
international press members.

1303
01:32:34,457 --> 01:32:37,893
l'll tell you why.
l'm in love with your sister.

1304
01:32:45,301 --> 01:32:47,428
ls this some kind ofjoke?

1305
01:32:48,370 --> 01:32:50,861
Kiki, could you get over here?

1306
01:32:56,011 --> 01:32:58,172
-Why her?
-Oh, why not?

1307
01:32:58,380 --> 01:33:01,941
ls it so unbelievable
that a man could love me?

1308
01:33:02,151 --> 01:33:04,119
-Not now.
-Now is the time.

1309
01:33:04,320 --> 01:33:07,653
-You just wait for me!
-Can l say something?

1310
01:33:07,857 --> 01:33:08,881
-Yes.
-No!

1311
01:33:09,091 --> 01:33:11,958
Listen. Okay, one nut at a time.

1312
01:33:12,328 --> 01:33:14,489
You're my sister. l love you.

1313
01:33:14,830 --> 01:33:20,166
You should know nothing happened
between me and Eddie until last night.

1314
01:33:20,369 --> 01:33:23,896
l feel much better
about you stealing my husband.

1315
01:33:24,106 --> 01:33:26,939
Ex-husband. l didn't steal anything.

1316
01:33:27,143 --> 01:33:32,410
You're the one shacked up for
the past year with Ricky Ricardo.

1317
01:33:35,284 --> 01:33:38,811
Look, l am just tired
of making excuses.

1318
01:33:39,021 --> 01:33:44,084
l am done picking up dirty clothes.
l am done pretending...

1319
01:33:44,293 --> 01:33:46,784
...that your life is my whole life.

1320
01:33:47,196 --> 01:33:48,959
l'm just.... l'm done.

1321
01:33:49,165 --> 01:33:52,828
So what you're really
worried about is you, right?

1322
01:33:56,205 --> 01:33:59,538
Well, l guess you're fired.

1323
01:34:03,612 --> 01:34:05,375
Honey.

1324
01:34:08,384 --> 01:34:11,979
You know all l care about
is your happiness.

1325
01:34:12,188 --> 01:34:13,177
That's sweet--

1326
01:34:13,389 --> 01:34:17,792
So don't worry about me.
l'll be fine.

1327
01:34:22,131 --> 01:34:24,463
-You're unbelievable.
-Shut up.

1328
01:34:24,867 --> 01:34:26,767
Next? What can l do for you?

1329
01:34:26,969 --> 01:34:30,996
l shouldn't have said that
in front of everybody, but--

1330
01:34:31,207 --> 01:34:33,675
l've been searching for clarity.

1331
01:34:33,876 --> 01:34:37,710
All of a sudden l am so clear,
it's ridiculous.

1332
01:34:38,247 --> 01:34:41,774
-l want to be with you.
-When did you decide this?

1333
01:34:42,384 --> 01:34:44,875
The moment l thought l'd lost you.

1334
01:34:45,321 --> 01:34:47,380
-Damn it.
-What?

1335
01:34:47,723 --> 01:34:50,692
That was.... That was good.

1336
01:34:52,661 --> 01:34:56,791
No. No, this is crazy.
Eddie, this isn't gonna work.

1337
01:34:56,999 --> 01:34:58,330
Listen to me.

1338
01:35:00,369 --> 01:35:02,394
l'm grateful for you.

1339
01:35:03,672 --> 01:35:08,439
ln all the world, the thing
l'm most grateful for is you.

1340
01:35:12,147 --> 01:35:15,742
-lf that's a line from your movie--
-That one's mine.

1341
01:35:18,954 --> 01:35:21,548
-What do we do now?
-Traditionally...

1342
01:35:21,757 --> 01:35:22,849
...we kiss.

1343
01:35:35,271 --> 01:35:38,866
Give her some room.
Thank you. Step back, please.

1344
01:35:39,441 --> 01:35:40,931
Easy, easy.

1345
01:35:42,444 --> 01:35:44,571
l'm on pain medication...

1346
01:35:44,780 --> 01:35:48,614
...that makes me say things
l'd never say otherwise.

1347
01:35:48,817 --> 01:35:51,581
To set the record
perfectly straight...

1348
01:35:51,787 --> 01:35:54,950
...Eddie and l never
had any plans to reconcile.

1349
01:35:55,291 --> 01:35:56,280
And?

1350
01:35:56,492 --> 01:35:59,086
And Hector is very well-endowed.

1351
01:35:59,295 --> 01:36:03,322
Almost too well-endowed.
l've had complaints. Literally.

1352
01:36:09,305 --> 01:36:11,398
-What are you doing?
-Packing.

1353
01:36:11,707 --> 01:36:14,505
-Let me help you with that.
-That's okay.

1354
01:36:14,710 --> 01:36:17,235
That's-- No, really--
Folding!

1355
01:36:17,446 --> 01:36:19,846
Let somebody help you for once.

1356
01:36:23,952 --> 01:36:25,112
There you are.

1357
01:36:26,088 --> 01:36:27,680
That was unbelievable.

1358
01:36:27,890 --> 01:36:30,290
Like a movie with a stage show.

1359
01:36:30,492 --> 01:36:33,586
lf you'd tour with the film,
we'd be rich.

1360
01:36:33,796 --> 01:36:36,594
And your sister is unbelievable.

1361
01:36:36,799 --> 01:36:41,827
The entire country has voted her
off the island but, no! She's back!

1362
01:36:42,037 --> 01:36:44,198
l've never seen anything like it.

1363
01:36:44,406 --> 01:36:48,502
