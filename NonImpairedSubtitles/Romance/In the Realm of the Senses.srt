1
00:00:30,159 --> 00:00:38,959
IN THE REALM OF THE SENSES

2
00:00:58,427 --> 00:01:00,257
Awake already?

3
00:01:00,595 --> 00:01:04,086
It's so cold. It's too early
to get up.

4
00:01:04,497 --> 00:01:08,159
- Let's sleep a little longer.
- I can't sleep.

5
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,230
I can't go to sleep
so early.

6
00:01:10,568 --> 00:01:13,229
That's natural.

7
00:01:13,602 --> 00:01:18,095
When I began working here,
I had the same problem.

8
00:01:18,372 --> 00:01:24,206
You're so attractive. Far too
lovely for a place like this.

9
00:01:24,442 --> 00:01:30,207
Yesterday, when I first saw you,
I knew we'd get along.

10
00:01:34,415 --> 00:01:36,211
kiss me, Sada.

11
00:01:37,449 --> 00:01:39,211
No, your hands are too cold.

12
00:01:42,653 --> 00:01:46,246
I love stroking your skin;
it's so smooth.

13
00:01:46,554 --> 00:01:49,283
Sada, don't you like it
when I caress you?

14
00:01:53,492 --> 00:01:54,288
Listen...

15
00:03:01,564 --> 00:03:04,361
Each morning is just like this.
Afterward, he goes to market.

16
00:03:36,684 --> 00:03:39,049
Let's play a game.
You first.

17
00:03:39,286 --> 00:03:42,277
Lucky in love.
Love is blind!

18
00:03:42,754 --> 00:03:46,450
- Blind man's bluff!
- Bluff at love!

19
00:03:46,657 --> 00:03:48,453
Love's a bluff!

20
00:03:55,762 --> 00:03:57,456
What are you children up to?
What are you doing?

21
00:03:57,930 --> 00:03:59,396
Stop! Leave the poor man alone!

22
00:03:59,664 --> 00:04:01,961
You heard what she said.
Leave him alone!

23
00:04:13,538 --> 00:04:14,630
- Oh! It's horrible!
- Horrible!

24
00:04:23,077 --> 00:04:25,306
Get away,
you filthy little tramps!

25
00:04:25,679 --> 00:04:27,339
Get out of here!
I said out!

26
00:04:34,784 --> 00:04:36,444
No, wait! I know you!

27
00:04:38,686 --> 00:04:40,347
Let go of me!
I don't know you!

28
00:04:40,421 --> 00:04:45,322
Don't touch her!
keep your filthy hands off her!

29
00:04:50,826 --> 00:04:53,419
Just wait a second.
I know I've seen you.

30
00:04:55,596 --> 00:05:00,554
It was in Osaka or Nagoya...

31
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:01,663
Tokyo!

32
00:05:03,401 --> 00:05:05,664
It's you, all right!
You were the nicest one there.

33
00:05:06,869 --> 00:05:09,029
I used to be one of
your best customers.

34
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:11,403
You must remember me!

35
00:05:11,638 --> 00:05:13,401
How can I remember someone
I've never laid eyes on?

36
00:05:13,806 --> 00:05:15,364
I want you!
I want you now!

37
00:05:15,541 --> 00:05:17,405
Look. I have money.
I can pay you!

38
00:05:29,849 --> 00:05:32,407
Please, just this once.
Once, that's all.

39
00:05:32,884 --> 00:05:35,249
I beg of you!

40
00:05:36,353 --> 00:05:38,445
You've been waiting
all day?

41
00:05:47,626 --> 00:05:49,490
God bless you!
You're still the nicest one.

42
00:05:49,794 --> 00:05:51,454
Sit down.

43
00:05:51,528 --> 00:05:53,859
Did you mean it, saying you'd
never seen me before?

44
00:05:54,129 --> 00:05:55,528
But I never have.

45
00:05:57,165 --> 00:05:59,598
What now? How can I do
anything with that?

46
00:06:05,402 --> 00:06:07,131
Are you cold?

47
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:09,662
No, no, it would be easier
if I could see your...

48
00:06:09,738 --> 00:06:11,672
I doubt it, but we can try.

49
00:06:29,249 --> 00:06:30,715
You'll catch cold.

50
00:06:32,285 --> 00:06:34,514
You'd better put it away
before it freezes.

51
00:06:43,124 --> 00:06:44,647
Poor old thing.

52
00:06:44,858 --> 00:06:47,883
Stop wasting time!
Hurry up now!

53
00:06:48,327 --> 00:06:50,123
Where have you been?

54
00:06:50,495 --> 00:06:54,054
Here. Take this tray in
immediately!

55
00:06:54,397 --> 00:06:57,524
Better change your ways.
We have a reputation to uphold.

56
00:06:58,732 --> 00:07:00,563
Don't look at me that way!

57
00:07:03,069 --> 00:07:04,467
Stop it! Stop!

58
00:07:04,803 --> 00:07:06,292
Stop!

59
00:07:06,537 --> 00:07:09,528
Now stop this immediately!
What have you against her?

60
00:07:10,006 --> 00:07:11,563
She's nothing but a whore,
a common whore...

61
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:13,434
and that's all
she'll ever be!

62
00:07:13,908 --> 00:07:17,433
Let me go!
I'll kill her!

63
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:20,539
- I said stop it!
- You bitch!

64
00:07:20,846 --> 00:07:22,540
What do you have against whores?
Who do you think you are?

65
00:07:24,747 --> 00:07:26,214
Enough!
You too!

66
00:07:26,482 --> 00:07:29,450
I've had enough! You're both
to blame! Get back to work!

67
00:07:29,517 --> 00:07:32,542
- Filthy whore!
- Let me go!

68
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:41,514
What's going on here?

69
00:07:41,657 --> 00:07:43,521
You're behaving
like children.

70
00:07:45,993 --> 00:07:49,655
I haven't seen you before.
Are you new here? Answer me.

71
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:52,558
What's your name?

72
00:07:54,232 --> 00:07:55,425
Sada.

73
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,496
Abe Sada.

74
00:08:01,602 --> 00:08:05,435
This wouldn't occur if you were
here to help now and then.

75
00:08:08,539 --> 00:08:10,507
Give me the knife.

76
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:13,504
What beautiful hands you have.

77
00:08:13,742 --> 00:08:15,504
Why use them for violence...

78
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:18,241
when you could use them
for other things.

79
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:31,809
That's a lovely sight!

80
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:41,255
No, don't stop.
Go on working.

81
00:08:46,694 --> 00:08:50,526
If you fear getting burned, girl
don't play with fire

82
00:08:52,764 --> 00:08:54,527
I like the sway
of your hips.

83
00:08:57,967 --> 00:09:02,026
A girl like you can stab a man's
heart without a knife, huh?

84
00:09:04,905 --> 00:09:06,566
Little girl, there's a fire...

85
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,005
How many hearts have you broken?
Tell me.

86
00:09:19,647 --> 00:09:21,443
What are you doing, Master?

87
00:09:27,451 --> 00:09:30,646
You like it, don't you.
I know you do.

88
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,910
But listen, Master.

89
00:09:33,087 --> 00:09:34,917
I have a man in my life
who gets very jealous.

90
00:09:35,255 --> 00:09:40,623
I know all about your man.
Your gigolo's bankrupt.

91
00:09:43,928 --> 00:09:46,861
- You work here to pay his debts.
- Yes.

92
00:09:48,263 --> 00:09:49,627
Life is hard.

93
00:09:53,033 --> 00:09:56,057
Besides, you aren't
that virtuous, are you?

94
00:09:58,669 --> 00:10:02,694
I was told this house has
a respectable reputation.

95
00:10:03,004 --> 00:10:04,699
Of course, you're right.

96
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:10,333
A respectable house
with a respectable master.

97
00:10:19,914 --> 00:10:22,939
Haven't you finished yet?
Hurry!

98
00:10:45,062 --> 00:10:48,360
Good evening, Master.
Are you alone tonight?

99
00:10:48,531 --> 00:10:50,555
I'm not allowed
to go out at night...

100
00:10:50,699 --> 00:10:53,394
and so the master becomes
the client.

101
00:10:53,734 --> 00:10:55,633
Why aren't you allowed
out at night?

102
00:10:56,768 --> 00:10:58,632
There are too many temptations.

103
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:19,570
Mistress told me
to serve a customer.

104
00:11:19,748 --> 00:11:24,206
- I had no idea it was you.
- Now you know.

105
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:27,713
This path is filled
with hidden treasure

106
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:30,454
Ieading man
to eternal pleasure

107
00:11:34,056 --> 00:11:36,717
What's the matter? Are you
ashamed of your desire?

108
00:11:39,693 --> 00:11:42,684
Life is made for pleasure.
Come, Sada.

109
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:07,732
I love it.

110
00:12:11,778 --> 00:12:13,642
If you go on, l--

111
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,607
The geisha will be here soon.

112
00:12:21,751 --> 00:12:23,650
I can't stand it.

113
00:12:23,918 --> 00:12:26,647
- You want me to stop?
- Yes, yes.

114
00:12:29,988 --> 00:12:31,683
It's driving me mad.

115
00:12:32,156 --> 00:12:34,090
Mad? Why?
Tell me why.

116
00:12:34,324 --> 00:12:35,689
I feel reborn.

117
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:44,491
Good evening. I'm the geisha
you invited.

118
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:47,095
- May I come in?
- In a moment.

119
00:12:48,632 --> 00:12:53,727
- I'm busy right now. Just wait.
- I'm in no hurry, sir.

120
00:13:12,913 --> 00:13:14,243
Okay, you can come in now.

121
00:13:18,549 --> 00:13:20,743
- Now I'm here.
- Yes.

122
00:13:27,655 --> 00:13:29,713
Good evening to you.

123
00:13:33,725 --> 00:13:35,692
A lovely young girl!

124
00:13:55,404 --> 00:13:58,769
- Where are you going?
- To the bathroom.

125
00:14:07,544 --> 00:14:08,306
Well, go.

126
00:14:08,411 --> 00:14:10,810
But I can wait...
if you wish.

127
00:14:12,747 --> 00:14:15,772
I've heard it's better
if you wait a little.

128
00:14:26,188 --> 00:14:27,712
Slowly. There's no hurry.

129
00:14:30,091 --> 00:14:31,751
Last night, l...

130
00:14:33,992 --> 00:14:35,754
I came too soon for you!

131
00:14:37,894 --> 00:14:39,691
Think of yourself.

132
00:14:40,062 --> 00:14:41,791
I want to feel your pleasure.
Don't think of me.

133
00:14:42,231 --> 00:14:43,857
I want you to feel free.

134
00:14:45,265 --> 00:14:46,732
It's for you that I hold back.

135
00:14:46,999 --> 00:14:48,830
I can't stop. I--

136
00:15:15,616 --> 00:15:18,914
Now you'll start over again
with your wife, won't you?

137
00:15:22,987 --> 00:15:27,820
How can you make love to her
at the same hour each day?

138
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,689
So you've seen us?
You were watching, huh?

139
00:15:35,994 --> 00:15:39,326
Yes. I won't let you return to her
until I've satisfied you.

140
00:15:41,197 --> 00:15:42,858
You torture yourself
for nothing.

141
00:15:42,931 --> 00:15:45,899
We have plenty of time.
All the time in the world.

142
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:53,831
We haven't. Master,
it will be sunrise soon.

143
00:15:54,205 --> 00:15:55,831
I said not to worry
about me.

144
00:16:45,801 --> 00:16:47,860
You're an extraordinary woman.

145
00:18:06,881 --> 00:18:10,815
I can't go on.
Let me stop playing.

146
00:18:11,217 --> 00:18:13,844
You must go on
in place of the geisha.

147
00:18:14,252 --> 00:18:17,913
I didn't invite her so you and l
could be alone tonight.

148
00:18:18,154 --> 00:18:21,020
But you must keep playing
and singing...

149
00:18:21,189 --> 00:18:23,622
or my wife
will become suspicious.

150
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:28,919
- Why don't you sing instead?
- You sing a bit longer.

151
00:19:40,535 --> 00:19:43,934
Excuse me, Mistress.
I'm sorry to disturb you.

152
00:19:44,003 --> 00:19:45,095
Come in.

153
00:19:47,038 --> 00:19:52,064
I'm grateful for your kindness,
but feel unworthy of your trust.

154
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,037
I'd like permission
to leave here.

155
00:19:55,276 --> 00:19:57,971
There's no problem of trust.
That's silly.

156
00:19:58,311 --> 00:20:00,904
Go get me some water instead,
okay?

157
00:20:01,346 --> 00:20:02,073
Yes.

158
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:57,037
I want you to stay.
I am quite satisfied with you.

159
00:21:04,215 --> 00:21:06,580
You seem like
a very serious girl.

160
00:21:08,985 --> 00:21:13,976
I really wonder why you should
go away and leave us.

161
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,627
- Oh, God.
- What?

162
00:21:26,761 --> 00:21:28,125
My period just started.

163
00:21:34,566 --> 00:21:35,964
It doesn't matter.

164
00:21:59,714 --> 00:22:01,374
Hello. Anyone home?

165
00:22:04,049 --> 00:22:07,017
You're going to see me naked
for the first time.

166
00:22:08,819 --> 00:22:11,981
- Are you shy?
- A little, yes.

167
00:22:13,154 --> 00:22:16,054
You undress first.

168
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:19,056
Wait. Let me.
I want to undress you.

169
00:22:31,798 --> 00:22:33,958
How young and beautiful
you are!

170
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:39,028
I love the texture of your skin.
So smooth, like velvet.

171
00:22:42,205 --> 00:22:44,331
You devour men.

172
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:50,065
Are you reproaching me
for wanting you too much?

173
00:22:51,743 --> 00:22:56,179
You know, I'm no longer young.
I envy your youth.

174
00:23:06,918 --> 00:23:10,613
I love to caress your body.

175
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:13,083
I feel like biting you all over.

176
00:23:18,191 --> 00:23:21,125
Sorry, may I bring in
the sake?

177
00:23:21,227 --> 00:23:25,127
I was afraid you wouldn't be able
to go into town tonight.

178
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:29,022
I haven't gone into town.

179
00:23:29,464 --> 00:23:33,024
This is our home.
Just yours and mine.

180
00:23:33,367 --> 00:23:35,027
That's the most wonderful thing
I've ever heard.

181
00:23:55,913 --> 00:23:58,142
We wish you joy
and happiness.

182
00:24:28,432 --> 00:24:30,126
Now what am l
supposed to do?

183
00:24:30,599 --> 00:24:32,759
You mustn't ask me.
Aren't you the bride?

184
00:24:33,201 --> 00:24:36,135
How should I know? I've never
been married before.

185
00:24:36,236 --> 00:24:41,171
True enough. If my young bride
had already been married...

186
00:24:41,439 --> 00:24:44,066
then I'd be missing something
tonight!

187
00:24:44,474 --> 00:24:48,170
All this said, let's celebrate
this great event together.

188
00:24:48,376 --> 00:24:51,469
Rejoice with us on the happiest
day of our lives.

189
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:09,210
The time has come to celebrate
your first night together.

190
00:25:09,621 --> 00:25:10,383
Nervous?

191
00:25:10,489 --> 00:25:12,115
- It's a great moment.
- It is!

192
00:25:12,223 --> 00:25:14,122
What if the bride and groom
aren't exactly strangers?

193
00:25:14,391 --> 00:25:15,483
Nothing changes.

194
00:25:15,692 --> 00:25:18,853
While she's not a virgin,
she saved her virginity for you...

195
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,525
and pleasure comes
with experience.

196
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:21,588
Really?

197
00:25:23,496 --> 00:25:24,258
Really?

198
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,196
- Are you ready?
- Yes, Master, I'm ready now.

199
00:25:34,336 --> 00:25:39,203
Don't call me "Master." From now on,
call me kichi-san, okay?

200
00:25:41,273 --> 00:25:44,263
Thank you... kichi-san.

201
00:25:46,043 --> 00:25:47,134
Sada.

202
00:25:58,182 --> 00:25:59,114
What is it?

203
00:25:59,484 --> 00:26:01,144
You're trembling.
What's wrong?

204
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:04,042
What's the matter?

205
00:26:05,553 --> 00:26:09,283
I don't know.
I'm shaking all over.

206
00:26:13,792 --> 00:26:15,258
Let's begin.

207
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:36,160
- You look very interested.
- Get closer!

208
00:26:36,338 --> 00:26:38,202
- You'll get a better view.
- It's the only way to learn.

209
00:26:38,506 --> 00:26:40,200
Come on. There's nothing
to be afraid of.

210
00:26:40,673 --> 00:26:42,197
No, no, leave me alone!

211
00:26:42,408 --> 00:26:45,273
- Go on!
- You should know more about men.

212
00:26:45,443 --> 00:26:46,774
Look well!

213
00:26:47,177 --> 00:26:49,270
keep your eyes open.
Don't close them. Look!

214
00:26:53,681 --> 00:26:55,477
It won't hurt for long!

215
00:26:59,317 --> 00:27:02,717
The pain is so great, I can't
bear it. It's too agonizing!

216
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:05,311
kosome, it's your turn now!

217
00:29:24,567 --> 00:29:26,329
Can I make the bed?

218
00:29:29,337 --> 00:29:32,169
- He's not awake yet. Do it later.
- Okay.

219
00:29:32,372 --> 00:29:36,272
- What time is it?
- It's almost 12:00.

220
00:29:44,945 --> 00:29:46,775
It's noon already.

221
00:29:47,113 --> 00:29:49,580
kichi-san, it's noon.
Wake up.

222
00:29:55,352 --> 00:29:56,750
Morning.

223
00:30:01,421 --> 00:30:04,355
Did you hold it all night,
or was it a dream?

224
00:30:05,323 --> 00:30:07,552
It wasn't a dream.

225
00:30:07,925 --> 00:30:10,484
You mean you didn't
sleep at all?

226
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,052
I spent the night looking at you.

227
00:30:13,128 --> 00:30:14,924
I couldn't stop.

228
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:18,287
You're wonderful.
You're so young.

229
00:30:18,765 --> 00:30:21,289
How can you look so lovely
and fresh without sleep?

230
00:30:21,367 --> 00:30:23,300
Makes me jealous!

231
00:30:26,569 --> 00:30:29,298
Are you in that big of a hurry?
Give me a minute, okay?

232
00:30:29,604 --> 00:30:32,163
- I want you now.
- I've got to pee. Okay with you?

233
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,301
There's no need to leave.
Do it here.

234
00:30:35,674 --> 00:30:36,834
Where?

235
00:30:36,975 --> 00:30:40,272
Inside of Sada,
all nice and warm.

236
00:30:40,443 --> 00:30:45,469
You're mad! It's impossible
to do both at the same time.

237
00:30:45,647 --> 00:30:47,477
We can try and see
what happens.

238
00:30:49,982 --> 00:30:52,916
Can't you wait one minute?

239
00:30:53,018 --> 00:30:56,350
I can't. I'm tired of waiting.
I want you now.

240
00:30:59,521 --> 00:31:01,385
You're insatiable!

241
00:31:14,263 --> 00:31:17,322
You want to make love
all the time, huh?

242
00:31:17,731 --> 00:31:20,290
You don't think it's wrong,
do you?

243
00:31:20,767 --> 00:31:24,361
I think it's wonderful.
You're beautiful.

244
00:31:29,438 --> 00:31:32,235
I was afraid of not
being like others.

245
00:31:32,473 --> 00:31:38,239
I was so worried about it,
I even went to see a doctor.

246
00:31:38,543 --> 00:31:42,034
He said I was sensitive
where sex was concerned.

247
00:31:42,446 --> 00:31:43,377
Sensitive?

248
00:31:44,614 --> 00:31:47,377
I hope it's incurable.

249
00:31:49,817 --> 00:31:52,375
Because I adore
your oversensitivity.

250
00:32:14,531 --> 00:32:15,758
Take me now!

251
00:32:15,831 --> 00:32:17,765
I want you now.
I can't wait any longer.

252
00:32:19,734 --> 00:32:20,825
Slowly.

253
00:32:22,768 --> 00:32:25,327
No, I can't wait!

254
00:33:02,225 --> 00:33:03,885
Why so cheerful?

255
00:33:03,959 --> 00:33:07,950
I was thinking that the only way
my penis can rest...

256
00:33:08,295 --> 00:33:12,389
is when it must go and pee,
isn't that so?

257
00:33:13,932 --> 00:33:15,193
That's right.

258
00:33:27,373 --> 00:33:28,862
I know one thing.

259
00:33:29,107 --> 00:33:33,838
It doesn't take you long,
once you've finished, to start again.

260
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:49,542
You see? It's just as I said.

261
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:54,384
You make it so obedient
to your touch.

262
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:56,882
I often wonder
whose it is.

263
00:33:57,289 --> 00:33:58,915
It's all mine!

264
00:34:02,925 --> 00:34:06,052
Why does it become so hard
suddenly?

265
00:34:06,395 --> 00:34:07,554
Do you know why?

266
00:34:10,296 --> 00:34:12,388
That's because...

267
00:34:12,464 --> 00:34:15,432
because it wants you more than
anything in the world.

268
00:34:19,835 --> 00:34:22,200
Please. I can wait no longer!

269
00:34:30,675 --> 00:34:34,439
- We can be seen here.
- Let them watch. I don't care.

270
00:34:41,515 --> 00:34:44,949
Well, grandmother,
working hard, huh?

271
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:47,009
Yes. It keeps
an old woman busy!

272
00:35:01,459 --> 00:35:02,926
We'd better part here.

273
00:35:03,194 --> 00:35:06,457
Not yet. Let's separate
just before you reach home.

274
00:35:08,396 --> 00:35:12,456
Leave it alone.
Don't you realize it's tired?

275
00:35:38,314 --> 00:35:40,144
My servants will see us.
Let go of me, please.

276
00:35:40,482 --> 00:35:42,881
How can l?
It's so nice and hard.

277
00:35:43,084 --> 00:35:46,449
That's because you're holding it.
Let go.

278
00:35:46,552 --> 00:35:50,509
On one condition. That you
take me now, right here!

279
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:03,794
- Pardon me. I have your sake.
- Come in.

280
00:36:07,797 --> 00:36:10,492
You're not in bed together
for once? That's unusual.

281
00:36:15,168 --> 00:36:18,465
I had to bring the sake.
The servants won't come in here.

282
00:36:19,938 --> 00:36:21,962
Why's that?

283
00:36:22,106 --> 00:36:26,541
- You're always in the middle of--
- Of what?

284
00:36:28,609 --> 00:36:30,701
Taking it in my mouth
and sucking it.

285
00:36:40,316 --> 00:36:43,512
I'd appreciate it
if you'd care for kichi.

286
00:36:43,784 --> 00:36:46,809
I must leave,
but I'll return tomorrow.

287
00:36:47,253 --> 00:36:48,549
Watch him closely.

288
00:36:48,987 --> 00:36:52,422
He's to stay here. He's not
allowed to go out, understand?

289
00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:57,518
I'll do what I can.
What about the geishas?

290
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,723
- They can come if he wants them.
- Really?

291
00:37:14,568 --> 00:37:16,558
Do I look elegant?

292
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:22,606
You look lovelier every day.

293
00:37:28,009 --> 00:37:29,533
Not again!

294
00:37:34,514 --> 00:37:38,505
You make me feel things
I've never felt.

295
00:37:41,451 --> 00:37:43,281
Scandalous!

296
00:37:54,892 --> 00:37:57,052
I know we need the money...

297
00:37:57,493 --> 00:38:00,518
but when I think of you
with someone else, I get jealous.

298
00:38:02,263 --> 00:38:05,424
Jealous? If you really
get jealous, that's wonderful.

299
00:38:05,731 --> 00:38:07,857
Tomorrow it'll be over.

300
00:38:08,332 --> 00:38:13,290
He's a school director
and an alderman.

301
00:38:13,536 --> 00:38:15,366
Very intellectual.

302
00:38:16,571 --> 00:38:21,506
- You like intellectuals, huh?
- I do. They're so generous!

303
00:38:51,691 --> 00:38:56,648
kichi-san, I've decided to wear
your kimono while I'm gone.

304
00:38:56,893 --> 00:38:58,053
Why?

305
00:38:59,495 --> 00:39:02,759
To insure you don't return
to your house.

306
00:39:05,566 --> 00:39:07,726
You want me to stay naked
while you're away?

307
00:39:10,768 --> 00:39:12,531
I'll lend you mine.

308
00:39:15,537 --> 00:39:18,596
- Here. Try it on.
- If you insist.

309
00:39:22,908 --> 00:39:23,670
Well?

310
00:40:10,169 --> 00:40:12,102
May I pour you some sake?

311
00:40:14,938 --> 00:40:17,633
Don't you want some, sir?

312
00:40:22,743 --> 00:40:26,268
You must eat something.
It's important.

313
00:40:26,645 --> 00:40:28,578
The two of you are impossible.
You never eat.

314
00:40:31,414 --> 00:40:33,745
Listen, sir. Leave now.
Don't wait for her to return.

315
00:40:34,016 --> 00:40:36,812
Go before it's too late!

316
00:40:37,050 --> 00:40:40,485
If you stay, that woman
will end up killing you.

317
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:43,412
What are you doing?
Let me go!

318
00:41:10,003 --> 00:41:12,630
Master, you seem tired
this afternoon.

319
00:41:13,038 --> 00:41:16,403
You know that you needn't
sleep with me.

320
00:41:16,506 --> 00:41:18,565
When you haven't wanted to,
I've understood.

321
00:41:18,675 --> 00:41:21,836
It isn't easy for me.

322
00:41:22,143 --> 00:41:24,576
I can't spend my nights alone
waiting for you.

323
00:41:24,745 --> 00:41:27,304
There's no need for that.
Why don't you sleep alone?

324
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:32,044
You promised to try, didn't you?
You swore you'd try.

325
00:41:32,116 --> 00:41:34,515
It's different with you...

326
00:41:34,717 --> 00:41:39,550
because I'm very fond of you
and I respect you.

327
00:41:39,919 --> 00:41:41,580
Do you understand, Master?

328
00:41:48,592 --> 00:41:50,491
I want you to beat me now!

329
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:53,686
- Slap me hard!
- Sada!

330
00:41:53,794 --> 00:41:55,523
Beat me hard!

331
00:41:56,829 --> 00:42:00,661
More, and harder!

332
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:05,628
Pinch me!
Pinch me now!

333
00:42:07,669 --> 00:42:09,569
keep pinching!
Don't stop!

334
00:42:09,837 --> 00:42:11,633
Make it hurt. Go on.
Harder!

335
00:42:12,438 --> 00:42:15,372
Now, pull-- Pull my hair!

336
00:42:18,942 --> 00:42:20,636
Pull it!

337
00:42:21,544 --> 00:42:24,875
More!

338
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,176
Make it hurt!

339
00:42:28,914 --> 00:42:33,645
I want to feel pain!
Please, don't stop!

340
00:43:21,812 --> 00:43:23,642
How have you been?

341
00:43:24,846 --> 00:43:26,609
- I've got money too!
- Really?

342
00:43:27,014 --> 00:43:29,005
Let's go spend it!

343
00:43:40,022 --> 00:43:41,613
I missed you so much.

344
00:43:43,924 --> 00:43:46,687
I'm never going
to leave you again.

345
00:43:52,162 --> 00:43:57,654
- Let me love you this time.
- If you like.

346
00:43:58,666 --> 00:44:02,691
You lead and I'll follow.

347
00:44:07,771 --> 00:44:11,637
Wait and see how good I am.
You promised I could lead.

348
00:44:19,044 --> 00:44:21,568
You look radiant!

349
00:44:21,645 --> 00:44:24,636
You're so alive and happy,
one would think you're 16!

350
00:44:26,849 --> 00:44:28,645
It's good to be home.

351
00:44:29,016 --> 00:44:34,645
I love to watch you
going in and out of me.

352
00:44:39,856 --> 00:44:41,118
I adore it.

353
00:44:43,759 --> 00:44:45,248
I adore it.

354
00:45:34,053 --> 00:45:35,713
Don't move.

355
00:45:47,494 --> 00:45:49,688
What was it like
with your intellectual?

356
00:45:52,697 --> 00:45:55,722
I want to know exactly.
Show me.

357
00:46:00,068 --> 00:46:02,695
No, it tickles.

358
00:46:03,103 --> 00:46:05,366
He found it erotic.
It didn't tickle him!

359
00:46:05,704 --> 00:46:07,728
So, he's a lecherous
school director.

360
00:46:12,642 --> 00:46:15,872
"Listen, Sada, your future
depends on your virtue...

361
00:46:16,111 --> 00:46:18,704
so you'd better change
your ways."

362
00:46:26,516 --> 00:46:29,848
Then, was he virtuous?

363
00:46:29,985 --> 00:46:34,386
Oh, yes. Very.
He was very well-behaved.

364
00:46:34,755 --> 00:46:36,722
What about you?

365
00:46:37,790 --> 00:46:40,689
Please don't be angry.

366
00:46:40,825 --> 00:46:44,783
I suddenly thought of you
and I lost control.

367
00:46:46,895 --> 00:46:49,726
I don't know why...

368
00:46:49,930 --> 00:46:54,558
but I asked him to beat me
as hard as he could.

369
00:46:54,699 --> 00:46:57,826
And your intellectual?
What did he do?

370
00:47:05,539 --> 00:47:06,937
Come on, Sada. Hit me.

371
00:47:09,875 --> 00:47:11,603
Why?

372
00:47:12,043 --> 00:47:13,566
Beat me!

373
00:47:16,812 --> 00:47:17,800
More!

374
00:47:19,414 --> 00:47:20,744
Go on. Harder!

375
00:47:22,015 --> 00:47:23,811
Harder!
Harder!

376
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:25,948
Even harder!

377
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:32,780
Don't stop! Harder!

378
00:48:42,227 --> 00:48:46,787
All we do, even eating,
must be an act of love.

379
00:48:59,571 --> 00:49:01,197
I love it.

380
00:49:06,942 --> 00:49:12,707
I'm still hungry. My pleasure
lies in giving you pleasure.

381
00:49:13,012 --> 00:49:15,445
and obeying your every desire.

382
00:49:26,452 --> 00:49:28,316
Wonderful appetizer!

383
00:49:30,788 --> 00:49:34,746
I want an egg now.
You want one?

384
00:49:49,866 --> 00:49:52,766
kichi-san! I want you
to get it out. Come!

385
00:49:52,901 --> 00:49:55,767
Take it out right now!

386
00:49:57,237 --> 00:49:59,568
How can l
if you're sitting down?

387
00:49:59,838 --> 00:50:02,499
Haven't you ever watched
a hen lay an egg?

388
00:50:02,874 --> 00:50:06,672
- Like this?
- That's right.

389
00:50:06,776 --> 00:50:08,743
Now push, that's all.
It'll come out.

390
00:50:08,944 --> 00:50:10,240
There it is.

391
00:50:15,881 --> 00:50:17,848
- You got it.
- Eat it!

392
00:50:21,084 --> 00:50:22,744
Sada, don't.
We're not alone.

393
00:50:22,818 --> 00:50:24,910
I don't care!
I want you now!

394
00:50:30,189 --> 00:50:32,748
- What's that for?
- To cut it off!

395
00:50:33,224 --> 00:50:34,656
Why?

396
00:50:34,959 --> 00:50:37,392
So it won't ever go inside
anyone else!

397
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:40,027
It's never betrayed you.
I swear.

398
00:50:40,162 --> 00:50:43,721
I don't believe it. You'll use it
to make love to other women.

399
00:50:44,064 --> 00:50:46,725
Cut it off if you want,
but you'll regret it.

400
00:50:47,099 --> 00:50:50,396
No, kichi-san.
Why will I regret it?

401
00:50:50,567 --> 00:50:54,797
That way, I'll have it
inside me forever.

402
00:50:56,204 --> 00:50:58,000
Cut it, then, if you want.

403
00:51:00,974 --> 00:51:05,875
If I cut it off,
do you think you'll die?

404
00:51:07,043 --> 00:51:09,203
Most likely.

405
00:51:09,645 --> 00:51:11,805
I don't want you to die.

406
00:51:14,848 --> 00:51:16,439
Then I won't die.

407
00:51:16,582 --> 00:51:19,675
I promised to be with you
forever, didn't l?

408
00:51:20,050 --> 00:51:23,416
I said I would set you up
in a small inn.

409
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:25,850
I won't be the "other woman."

410
00:51:26,121 --> 00:51:29,146
I won't share you
with your wife.

411
00:51:29,589 --> 00:51:31,749
You belong to Sada
and to no one else!

412
00:51:33,926 --> 00:51:36,552
Listen. I'll end up a skeleton
if we're always together.

413
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:39,291
There'll be nothing left
of kichi-san at all!

414
00:51:39,562 --> 00:51:42,894
You don't want me.
Is that what you're saying?

415
00:51:46,065 --> 00:51:49,727
Though reduced to a skeleton,
I'll never leave you.

416
00:51:49,968 --> 00:51:54,835
I won't let you go even if you
are a skeleton, okay?

417
00:52:00,374 --> 00:52:04,866
Could you stop threatening me
with that knife? It's dangerous!

418
00:52:16,416 --> 00:52:19,748
You don't want to grow a beard.
You'll look awful.

419
00:52:25,521 --> 00:52:28,819
Swear you'll never make love
to your wife again.

420
00:52:29,858 --> 00:52:31,654
I swear.

421
00:52:32,026 --> 00:52:35,460
- Repeat: "I'll never do it again."
- I'll never do it again.

422
00:52:35,927 --> 00:52:38,520
Say: "You may kill me
if I ever make love to her."

423
00:52:38,963 --> 00:52:40,827
I allow you to kill me
if I make love to her.

424
00:53:12,348 --> 00:53:14,907
- Shall we scare her?
- Good idea.

425
00:53:17,117 --> 00:53:18,311
I'm a ghost.

426
00:53:19,719 --> 00:53:21,811
- The haunted parasol!
- I've come to haunt you!

427
00:53:21,887 --> 00:53:23,877
Watch out for my spear!

428
00:53:27,957 --> 00:53:32,415
- Why don't you make love to her?
- No! She's not my type!

429
00:53:50,070 --> 00:53:53,232
I'm sorry, but it's closing time.

430
00:53:56,573 --> 00:53:59,541
Look! Like it? It's lovely,
don't you think?

431
00:53:59,608 --> 00:54:04,134
If you serve us a drink,
you can play with it.

432
00:54:06,112 --> 00:54:08,978
I'm not much good anymore.
I only use it to pee.

433
00:54:19,986 --> 00:54:22,886
Let's stay together always!

434
00:54:47,303 --> 00:54:52,829
I caught you! Don't be afraid.
Come. Sit next to me. Come on.

435
00:54:52,939 --> 00:54:55,065
I'm going to catch you!

436
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:18,948
Don't! It hurts!

437
00:55:19,387 --> 00:55:22,877
Let go of me!
She's hurting me!

438
00:55:45,402 --> 00:55:48,892
Hear that? Do you think
it's a burglar?

439
00:55:49,304 --> 00:55:52,397
No. A burglar wouldn't make
all that noise.

440
00:55:54,074 --> 00:55:59,032
It's probably a drunk.
Don't worry. Come back to bed.

441
00:56:04,913 --> 00:56:08,905
I know who it is. That whore
of yours, watching us.

442
00:56:12,718 --> 00:56:14,241
Go to sleep.

443
00:56:33,096 --> 00:56:35,529
Going to see her,
aren't you?

444
00:56:38,299 --> 00:56:41,131
You came in so quietly
you scared me.

445
00:56:47,838 --> 00:56:49,998
Don't worry about it.

446
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:17,884
Excuse me, Master.
You're wanted on the phone.

447
00:58:20,190 --> 00:58:21,248
Wait.

448
00:58:36,233 --> 00:58:37,222
Good evening.

449
00:58:39,268 --> 00:58:39,859
Good evening, sir.

450
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:43,735
I warned you!

451
00:58:47,939 --> 00:58:48,928
I warned you!

452
00:58:49,241 --> 00:58:52,970
I want the truth. You made love
to your wife, didn't you?

453
00:58:53,142 --> 00:58:58,009
Stop playing with that knife
as if you wielded a dagger.

454
00:58:58,346 --> 00:59:00,438
You won't kill anyone
with that.

455
00:59:00,513 --> 00:59:02,946
I wanted to buy a sword
to kill you!

456
00:59:03,115 --> 00:59:06,913
Why didn't you go through with it,
if it was your intention?

457
00:59:07,017 --> 00:59:08,950
How? I didn't dare
with everyone staring.

458
00:59:09,185 --> 00:59:11,982
What are you talking about?
Don't be silly!

459
00:59:12,220 --> 00:59:15,847
How would anyone guess why you
wanted a dagger? You're mad!

460
00:59:16,122 --> 00:59:19,921
It's all you think of. It's a
fixation, an obsession. know that?

461
00:59:20,025 --> 00:59:22,890
So you think I'm mad because
I can't stop thinking of you?

462
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:24,958
Is that what you call
an obsession?

463
00:59:27,395 --> 00:59:29,658
Take off your kimono.
Take it off!

464
00:59:29,997 --> 00:59:32,055
It's hideous.
Take it off.

465
00:59:32,164 --> 00:59:34,063
Are you going to
take it off?

466
00:59:34,332 --> 00:59:35,890
In this position,
it's not easy.

467
00:59:36,067 --> 00:59:38,500
I can't undress alone.
You must help me.

468
00:59:39,535 --> 00:59:42,059
You undress me, would you?

469
00:59:49,942 --> 00:59:51,101
Be honest!

470
00:59:53,844 --> 00:59:56,209
You made love to your wife,
didn't you?

471
00:59:59,047 --> 01:00:02,572
Look at it! There's your answer.
It's been faithful.

472
01:00:02,949 --> 01:00:05,007
- Apologize!
- Why should it apologize?

473
01:00:05,117 --> 01:00:07,050
It has no reason
to apologize.

474
01:00:09,019 --> 01:00:13,977
It knows what it wants!
I'll punish it! You'll see!

475
01:00:14,222 --> 01:00:16,951
Go on. Y es, punish it
as much as you like!

476
01:00:52,377 --> 01:00:54,241
That hurt me!

477
01:00:54,545 --> 01:00:56,671
- Does it hurt?
- It certainly does.

478
01:00:58,881 --> 01:01:00,370
Are you pretending,
or does it hurt?

479
01:01:00,615 --> 01:01:01,775
It really hurts.

480
01:01:01,916 --> 01:01:04,110
Y et you love it
all the same!

481
01:01:04,518 --> 01:01:06,178
It's true.

482
01:01:06,252 --> 01:01:08,185
Say, "Bite harder
and harder!."

483
01:01:08,420 --> 01:01:10,182
Bite harder and harder.

484
01:01:11,889 --> 01:01:14,152
- Say, "Hurt me, Sada."
- Hurt me.

485
01:01:16,224 --> 01:01:20,989
I want to hurt you. I want you
to feel pain, to suffer!

486
01:01:30,966 --> 01:01:32,990
Go on. Punish me!

487
01:01:35,301 --> 01:01:40,066
Hurt me as much as you want,
whenever you want!

488
01:01:40,504 --> 01:01:43,995
Forgive me for having left you
alone these past 3 days. I'm sorry.

489
01:01:44,407 --> 01:01:47,033
I almost went mad!
I can't be without you!

490
01:01:47,442 --> 01:01:48,534
Forgive me.

491
01:01:55,246 --> 01:01:57,941
Sada, you're crying.
You're crying.

492
01:01:58,282 --> 01:02:01,272
- Because I love you.
- Sada, look at me.

493
01:02:01,750 --> 01:02:04,582
It's the first time I've
seen you cry. Look at me.

494
01:02:04,785 --> 01:02:06,718
- I don't want to!
- Look at me!

495
01:02:09,121 --> 01:02:11,953
Your tears are so salty.
I love to taste them.

496
01:02:12,156 --> 01:02:17,023
Hold me closer, kichi-san.
Don't ever leave me again!

497
01:02:22,996 --> 01:02:25,054
Can I bring in the sake?

498
01:02:29,933 --> 01:02:31,593
Come in.

499
01:02:31,667 --> 01:02:34,157
Bring it over here, please.
We're inseparable.

500
01:02:36,436 --> 01:02:38,300
Don't you ever eat anything?

501
01:02:38,604 --> 01:02:43,062
No, no. It makes the body heavy.
It puts you to sleep.

502
01:02:45,109 --> 01:02:47,575
The room must be cleaned
now and then.

503
01:02:47,709 --> 01:02:49,972
Haven't you noticed the smell?

504
01:02:50,311 --> 01:02:53,108
We love the smell in here.
It excites us even more.

505
01:03:02,885 --> 01:03:06,819
Wake up and open your eyes.

506
01:03:09,822 --> 01:03:12,312
You seem to get
even greater pleasure...

507
01:03:12,424 --> 01:03:16,051
when you're strangled
while making love.

508
01:03:19,361 --> 01:03:21,089
You clutched my throat
the other day and...

509
01:03:22,829 --> 01:03:24,387
it felt good.

510
01:03:24,564 --> 01:03:29,022
Did you enjoy it?
Strangle me, right now.

511
01:03:29,334 --> 01:03:30,300
Okay.

512
01:03:37,138 --> 01:03:39,071
Ready? I'm starting.

513
01:03:41,041 --> 01:03:44,099
As I press on your throat,
you'll feel a contraction lower down.

514
01:03:46,243 --> 01:03:48,472
- Am I hurting you?
- No.

515
01:03:50,146 --> 01:03:51,305
Press harder.

516
01:03:53,180 --> 01:03:54,977
Now, what do you feel?

517
01:04:07,055 --> 01:04:11,184
- Don't be afraid. Harder.
- I should stop. You're flushed.

518
01:04:11,390 --> 01:04:15,723
It doesn't matter.
Press harder. Don't worry.

519
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:18,025
I'll do as you say,
but it'll be painful.

520
01:04:18,328 --> 01:04:20,158
Don't be angry
if I hurt you.

521
01:04:30,468 --> 01:04:32,265
You don't want me to stop?

522
01:04:35,237 --> 01:04:36,602
Answer me.

523
01:04:40,441 --> 01:04:45,433
To reach total pleasure you
must go almost to the end.

524
01:04:45,644 --> 01:04:49,237
- How did it make you feel?
- I didn't like it.

525
01:04:49,546 --> 01:04:52,173
It's because you didn't
press hard enough.

526
01:04:52,581 --> 01:04:57,243
I won't go on. I get no pleasure
from torturing you.

527
01:04:57,350 --> 01:05:00,147
Then let's change places.
I'll strangle you.

528
01:05:08,190 --> 01:05:09,555
May I begin?

529
01:05:12,525 --> 01:05:13,617
Go ahead.

530
01:05:19,463 --> 01:05:22,295
- It tickles.
- You're frightened, huh?

531
01:05:22,498 --> 01:05:25,091
It's you who's hesitating.
Go on. I'm ready.

532
01:05:31,603 --> 01:05:34,162
Yes, it's beginning
to get hard.

533
01:05:41,142 --> 01:05:44,133
I feel it inside me
getting harder.

534
01:05:46,345 --> 01:05:48,209
I'm choking.

535
01:05:49,379 --> 01:05:51,176
Do it slowly.

536
01:05:55,450 --> 01:05:57,144
Now, I'm ready.

537
01:06:08,457 --> 01:06:10,220
It feels so good.

538
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:15,156
- I've never felt like this.
- Feels good?

539
01:06:18,430 --> 01:06:22,125
- I feel it moving!
- Feels good?

540
01:06:25,367 --> 01:06:27,129
I can feel it.

541
01:06:50,515 --> 01:06:52,209
It's moving.

542
01:07:07,424 --> 01:07:09,220
Can't breathe.

543
01:07:18,697 --> 01:07:21,790
- The geishas won't come in here.
- Why's that?

544
01:07:22,167 --> 01:07:23,793
Because of your reputation.

545
01:07:23,901 --> 01:07:27,028
Reputation. What do they say
about us? Tell me.

546
01:07:27,369 --> 01:07:29,200
- That you're disgusting.
- Say that again!

547
01:07:32,138 --> 01:07:35,732
- Let them talk.
- It's not their business.

548
01:07:36,041 --> 01:07:37,439
What's disgusting
about us?

549
01:07:37,775 --> 01:07:40,971
Well, you do nothing but
suck him all day long.

550
01:07:41,243 --> 01:07:43,177
What's wrong with that?

551
01:07:43,412 --> 01:07:45,038
What's disgusting
about it?

552
01:07:45,146 --> 01:07:49,046
Why shouldn't I taste the body
of the man I love? Come back!

553
01:07:49,482 --> 01:07:50,573
Let her be.

554
01:07:50,782 --> 01:07:52,716
- Tell me who's talking about us!
- Everyone!

555
01:07:52,950 --> 01:07:57,147
Everyone?
Not everyone. It's you, huh?

556
01:07:57,287 --> 01:08:01,153
Now, tell me if you think
we're disgusting. Well, do you?

557
01:08:08,126 --> 01:08:09,558
Stop it!

558
01:08:12,895 --> 01:08:16,829
Enough! She's only telling us
what she's heard.

559
01:08:19,832 --> 01:08:23,062
Anyway, I don't care,
and you shouldn't either.

560
01:08:23,301 --> 01:08:26,565
It doesn't matter what others
think of us.

561
01:08:26,770 --> 01:08:30,135
I want you to rape her now!

562
01:08:30,238 --> 01:08:33,035
No, don't, please.
I'll never marry if you do!

563
01:08:35,875 --> 01:08:37,102
Get out!

564
01:08:37,175 --> 01:08:39,200
You bitch! I can't bear
looking at you.

565
01:08:42,812 --> 01:08:45,075
My respects to you both!

566
01:08:45,414 --> 01:08:47,244
- She never stops sucking him!
- Good evening.

567
01:08:51,917 --> 01:08:56,147
My! You are so virile
and forceful, Master.

568
01:08:56,253 --> 01:09:00,551
- What should I play?
- Anything, as long as it's happy.

569
01:09:26,170 --> 01:09:29,366
They say I'm disgusting.
What do you think? Am l?

570
01:09:29,639 --> 01:09:31,071
How could they say so?

571
01:09:31,373 --> 01:09:35,705
I never get enough of his body,
and I love it without restraint.

572
01:09:36,142 --> 01:09:39,838
It's wonderful for a woman
to feel free with her lover.

573
01:09:40,044 --> 01:09:41,978
You understand?
How old are you?

574
01:09:42,213 --> 01:09:45,112
I'm 68 already.
How I envy your youth.

575
01:09:45,248 --> 01:09:49,444
Tell me your opinion.
Do you find him attractive?

576
01:09:49,583 --> 01:09:52,779
Oh, yes. I think
he's very attractive.

577
01:09:53,052 --> 01:09:55,451
Would you like him?

578
01:09:56,520 --> 01:09:59,113
I only meant
he was handsome.

579
01:09:59,556 --> 01:10:03,820
If you like... I'll let him
make love to you.

580
01:10:22,535 --> 01:10:25,367
It feels so young.
Extraordinary.

581
01:13:03,828 --> 01:13:05,419
Look at that.

582
01:13:10,765 --> 01:13:13,255
Poor woman couldn't hold back
any longer.

583
01:13:13,367 --> 01:13:15,459
Disgusting!

584
01:13:15,534 --> 01:13:17,524
I hope the shock
didn't kill her.

585
01:13:19,870 --> 01:13:22,633
You look pale suddenly?
What's the matter?

586
01:13:22,905 --> 01:13:25,168
You look as if you've
seen a ghost.

587
01:13:25,507 --> 01:13:27,235
Don't say that.

588
01:13:27,675 --> 01:13:32,133
I had the impression I was holding
my mother's dead body.

589
01:13:33,311 --> 01:13:38,542
- How long has she been dead?
- I was a child. What about yours?

590
01:13:38,948 --> 01:13:40,574
She died 3 years ago.

591
01:13:40,682 --> 01:13:43,241
I wasn't living at home
and didn't see her die.

592
01:13:43,717 --> 01:13:47,276
I heard she suffered. And Papa,
he died when I was young.

593
01:13:47,619 --> 01:13:50,280
Everything must have an end.

594
01:13:57,158 --> 01:13:58,784
- Sada.
- Is anything wrong?

595
01:14:01,494 --> 01:14:03,461
Let's be happy forever.

596
01:14:20,571 --> 01:14:22,435
I'll leave you here.

597
01:14:24,473 --> 01:14:27,839
You look very troubled today.

598
01:14:27,942 --> 01:14:30,603
You look as if the weight
of the world were on you.

599
01:14:34,446 --> 01:14:39,279
Might we go away alone
for a week or so, Master?

600
01:14:39,649 --> 01:14:41,047
Impossible!

601
01:14:41,383 --> 01:14:44,317
If anyone knew of us, I'd have
to shoot myself in the head.

602
01:15:52,057 --> 01:15:55,320
You're back? What happened?
Why did you return so soon?

603
01:15:55,525 --> 01:15:57,822
Why did you go out?

604
01:15:58,127 --> 01:16:01,618
You weren't here. I know it!
You let them clean the room!

605
01:16:02,030 --> 01:16:04,327
Don't torture yourself.
I went for a haircut.

606
01:16:04,630 --> 01:16:06,791
I was here
the rest of the time.

607
01:16:07,232 --> 01:16:10,166
I know you're lying!
I'll kill you!

608
01:16:10,267 --> 01:16:12,325
You decided to get a haircut...

609
01:16:12,435 --> 01:16:15,335
while I earned money
for you to live on?

610
01:16:18,072 --> 01:16:21,471
You told me your desire was
greater when I shaved my neck.

611
01:16:23,708 --> 01:16:27,336
I desire you so, and one day
I'll use my knife on you.

612
01:16:31,947 --> 01:16:33,846
You wouldn't do that to me.

613
01:16:34,981 --> 01:16:36,676
To be strangled is better.

614
01:16:40,184 --> 01:16:43,084
Really? So you'd like me
to strangle you?

615
01:17:16,606 --> 01:17:19,664
Put that knife away.

616
01:17:25,711 --> 01:17:27,268
You like being strangled?

617
01:17:29,613 --> 01:17:32,342
All I want is
to give you pleasure.

618
01:17:34,816 --> 01:17:37,340
"l want to be strangled."
Say it!

619
01:17:37,417 --> 01:17:39,748
I want to be strangled.

620
01:17:46,523 --> 01:17:47,682
Don't pull too hard.

621
01:17:50,424 --> 01:17:53,586
- You're frightened, huh?
- I'm terrified.

622
01:17:55,628 --> 01:17:58,619
Are you serious?

623
01:17:59,096 --> 01:18:01,393
You're teasing me.
You don't look terrified.

624
01:18:33,349 --> 01:18:34,747
I'm ready.

625
01:19:47,925 --> 01:19:49,892
Pull it tight.
Don't be afraid.

626
01:19:54,862 --> 01:19:56,055
Pull much tighter.

627
01:20:05,268 --> 01:20:07,132
Feel it getting harder?

628
01:20:08,737 --> 01:20:10,761
Do you?

629
01:20:10,905 --> 01:20:13,600
Go ahead. Pull as hard
as you can.

630
01:20:18,709 --> 01:20:20,199
You can choke me tighter.

631
01:20:40,822 --> 01:20:43,517
- Did I hurt you?
- Wait a moment.

632
01:20:46,891 --> 01:20:49,552
Why did you stop?
I was near ecstasy.

633
01:20:51,661 --> 01:20:55,494
Listen, I know what I'll do.
I'll tie your hands.

634
01:21:15,508 --> 01:21:19,408
Now you can't resist.
You can't stop me.

635
01:21:19,844 --> 01:21:21,311
That's right.

636
01:21:22,879 --> 01:21:26,041
If you dare refuse,
I'll pull even tighter.

637
01:21:26,781 --> 01:21:29,977
You know I belong to you.

638
01:21:30,250 --> 01:21:34,014
Do what you please. My body
is yours-- yours forever.

639
01:21:34,152 --> 01:21:37,450
I'll start again
and keep pulling harder.

640
01:21:43,691 --> 01:21:45,624
Slowly this time.

641
01:23:09,106 --> 01:23:11,437
Does it hurt you?

642
01:23:16,477 --> 01:23:19,036
Tell what it feels like.

643
01:23:21,680 --> 01:23:25,808
Like I'm part of you.

644
01:23:28,184 --> 01:23:30,413
Our bodies have melted into one,
bathing in a crimson pool.

645
01:23:32,519 --> 01:23:38,217
Your expression is so strange.
You seem so distant.

646
01:23:38,590 --> 01:23:42,922
- You frighten me. Say something.
- Say something? It's impossible.

647
01:23:43,359 --> 01:23:47,293
You expect me to say something
when I can't breathe?

648
01:23:51,597 --> 01:23:53,587
What give you pleasure
gives me happiness.

649
01:23:55,499 --> 01:23:57,728
Do you want me
to kill you?

650
01:24:04,171 --> 01:24:06,297
See?

651
01:24:06,773 --> 01:24:08,296
I'm going to kill you.

652
01:24:19,780 --> 01:24:21,337
I feel good.

653
01:24:24,549 --> 01:24:26,209
I'm coming.

654
01:24:31,920 --> 01:24:33,750
I'll kill you, at last!

655
01:25:19,614 --> 01:25:21,604
Happy, Sada?
Sada?

656
01:26:17,713 --> 01:26:20,010
I want you to try again.

657
01:26:20,315 --> 01:26:23,511
This time, I don't know
if I can do it again.

658
01:26:25,084 --> 01:26:27,244
Think you'll be able to?

659
01:28:49,901 --> 01:28:51,424
You look so sad.

660
01:28:53,802 --> 01:28:56,065
I'm sleepy, Sada.
Sleepy, that's all.

661
01:29:08,544 --> 01:29:11,671
If I fall asleep,
will you begin again?

662
01:29:15,916 --> 01:29:17,780
You'd like me
to strangle you again?

663
01:29:23,287 --> 01:29:24,412
Y es.

664
01:29:26,755 --> 01:29:29,245
This time, Sada...

665
01:29:29,356 --> 01:29:31,619
don't stop;
it's too painful afterwards.

666
01:31:15,150 --> 01:31:16,173
kichi-san.

667
01:31:19,052 --> 01:31:19,848
kichi-san.

668
01:31:29,025 --> 01:31:30,685
I'm starting now.

669
01:32:11,949 --> 01:32:15,748
- Where are you now?
- I'm not there yet.

670
01:32:21,488 --> 01:32:25,218
- Where are you now?
- I'm not there yet.

671
01:32:27,558 --> 01:32:29,923
Where are you now?

672
01:32:31,460 --> 01:32:34,121
I'm not there yet.

673
01:32:34,496 --> 01:32:39,454
- Where are you now?
- I'm not there yet.

674
01:32:39,698 --> 01:32:43,690
- Where are you now?
- I'm not there yet.

675
01:32:45,769 --> 01:32:46,894
Where are you now?

676
01:32:50,972 --> 01:32:52,700
Where are you now?

677
01:32:57,909 --> 01:32:59,239
Where are you now?

678
01:33:05,280 --> 01:33:07,179
Where are you now?

679
01:33:08,314 --> 01:33:10,645
Where are you now?

680
01:33:29,560 --> 01:33:32,858
kichi-san!

681
01:33:42,134 --> 01:33:43,157
kichi-san.

682
01:35:50,040 --> 01:35:52,371
For 4 days, carrying the part
she'd severed from his body...

683
01:35:52,642 --> 01:35:56,076
Sada wandered through Tokyo.

684
01:35:56,544 --> 01:35:59,842
Those arresting her were astounded
that she glowed with happiness...

685
01:36:01,313 --> 01:36:03,644
The story shocked
all of Japan.

686
01:36:03,915 --> 01:36:06,849
The compassion of the people
made her strangely popular.

687
01:36:08,251 --> 01:36:10,844
These events took place
in 1936.
