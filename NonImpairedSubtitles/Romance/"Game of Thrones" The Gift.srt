00:02:58,671 --> 00:03:00,805
First Ranger, you have
command of Castle Black.

3
00:03:01,173 --> 00:03:03,422
Lord Commander,
it is my duty to tell you

4
00:03:03,542 --> 00:03:06,645
I believe this mission
to be reckless, foolhardy,

5
00:03:06,946 --> 00:03:08,647
and an insult
to all the brothers

6
00:03:08,948 --> 00:03:11,650
who have died
fighting the wildlings.

7
00:03:11,951 --> 00:03:14,718
As always, thank you
for your honesty.

8
00:03:21,593 --> 00:03:22,960
Safe travels, Lord Commander.

9
00:03:23,195 --> 00:03:25,429
Thank you, Sam.

10
00:03:25,597 --> 00:03:27,265
Oh, um...

11
00:03:32,937 --> 00:03:34,337
It's dragonglass.

12
00:03:34,706 --> 00:03:36,473
It's what I used
to kill the white walker.

13
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,881
I hope you don't need them.

14
00:03:44,082 --> 00:03:46,115
Me, too.

15
00:04:01,332 --> 00:04:02,498
Yah.

16
00:04:19,449 --> 00:04:21,149
There he is.

17
00:04:25,255 --> 00:04:27,389
That laugh.

18
00:04:27,591 --> 00:04:29,692
<i>Egg.</i>

19
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:32,127
<i>Egg laughed like that.</i>

20
00:04:32,462 --> 00:04:35,496
<i>One of the first things
I remember.</i>

21
00:04:38,868 --> 00:04:42,537
His little brother Aegon.
He became king.

22
00:04:44,373 --> 00:04:48,476
And before that,
he was a jolly fellow,

23
00:04:48,677 --> 00:04:50,378
like this one.

24
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:59,019
Get him south, Gillyflower.

25
00:05:00,356 --> 00:05:02,890
Before it's too late.

26
00:05:53,841 --> 00:05:55,241
Theon, wait.

27
00:05:55,509 --> 00:05:57,576
Not Theon, my lady.
Reek.

28
00:05:57,744 --> 00:05:59,512
Help me.

29
00:06:01,014 --> 00:06:03,382
You're his wife now.

30
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:05,584
Theon.

31
00:06:05,786 --> 00:06:07,019
Do what he says.

32
00:06:07,287 --> 00:06:08,608
Do what he says
or he'll hurt you.

33
00:06:08,755 --> 00:06:11,357
He already hurts me every night.

34
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:12,865
All day I'm locked in this room

35
00:06:13,126 --> 00:06:14,926
and every night he comes...

36
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:19,063
It can't be any worse.

37
00:06:19,365 --> 00:06:22,934
It can.
It can always be worse.

38
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:33,731
- What did he do to you?
- Please.

39
00:06:33,946 --> 00:06:36,480
- You betrayed my family!
- I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

40
00:06:36,781 --> 00:06:38,883
You have to help me.
Theon, help me.

41
00:06:39,218 --> 00:06:42,353
He'll see us.
You don't know him.

42
00:06:42,721 --> 00:06:43,888
My family still has
friends in the North.

43
00:06:44,289 --> 00:06:47,191
All I need to do is give a
signal and they'll rescue me.

44
00:06:47,492 --> 00:06:49,693
Climb to the top
of the broken tower.

45
00:06:50,061 --> 00:06:51,741
Light this candle
and put it in the window.

46
00:06:52,063 --> 00:06:54,297
- Promise me, Theon.
- Reek! My name is Reek.

47
00:06:57,268 --> 00:07:00,070
Your name is Theon Greyjoy.

48
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:03,574
Last surviving son
of Balon Greyjoy,

49
00:07:03,808 --> 00:07:04,975
Lord of the Iron Islands.

50
00:07:05,176 --> 00:07:06,576
Do you hear me?

51
00:07:09,847 --> 00:07:11,414
Theon...

52
00:07:13,017 --> 00:07:14,351
promise me.

53
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:19,713
Yes, Reek?

54
00:08:35,497 --> 00:08:37,531
<i>Egg.</i>

55
00:08:37,699 --> 00:08:39,934
Egg.

56
00:08:42,203 --> 00:08:44,504
Mother's looking for you.

57
00:08:46,007 --> 00:08:47,941
Egg.

58
00:08:49,877 --> 00:08:52,512
Get some sleep, Sam.

59
00:08:52,847 --> 00:08:54,881
You'll have to speak
for him tomorrow.

60
00:08:56,717 --> 00:08:57,985
You don't know that.

61
00:08:58,219 --> 00:09:00,553
Get some sleep.

62
00:09:00,788 --> 00:09:03,222
I'll watch over him.

63
00:09:05,693 --> 00:09:08,060
I'm staying, too.

64
00:09:08,362 --> 00:09:10,062
He's always been good to me.

65
00:09:10,297 --> 00:09:12,064
I can't leave him now.

66
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,368
Egg!

67
00:09:26,613 --> 00:09:28,614
Egg.

68
00:09:29,949 --> 00:09:32,284
I dreamed...

69
00:09:32,486 --> 00:09:34,486
that I was old.

70
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:48,133
<i>His name
was Aemon Targaryen.</i>

71
00:09:49,668 --> 00:09:51,403
<i>He came to us
from King's Landing.</i>

72
00:09:54,006 --> 00:09:56,908
<i>A maester of the Citadel,
chained and sworn,</i>

73
00:09:57,343 --> 00:10:00,311
<i>and sworn brother of the
Night's Watch, ever faithful.</i>

74
00:10:01,747 --> 00:10:03,581
<i>No man was wiser</i>

75
00:10:03,815 --> 00:10:06,851
<i>or gentler or kinder.</i>

76
00:10:08,787 --> 00:10:11,422
At the Wall,
a dozen lord commanders

77
00:10:11,757 --> 00:10:13,858
came and went during
his years of service,

78
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:16,193
but he was always there
to counsel them.

79
00:10:19,665 --> 00:10:21,198
He was the blood
of the dragon...

80
00:10:23,501 --> 00:10:25,602
but now his fire has gone out.

81
00:10:28,339 --> 00:10:29,906
And now his watch is ended.

82
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:32,609
And now his watch is ended.

83
00:11:01,338 --> 00:11:03,639
You're losing
all your friends, Tarly.

84
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:42,844
My beautiful wife.

85
00:11:49,018 --> 00:11:50,579
When my father told me
we were marrying,

86
00:11:50,719 --> 00:11:53,755
I half expected
a fat, bearded beast.

87
00:11:58,694 --> 00:12:01,362
Do you know how pleased
I was when I saw you?

88
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:03,797
You've made me very happy.

89
00:12:08,803 --> 00:12:11,772
Our scouts report that Stannis
Baratheon rides for Winterfell.

90
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,542
He's a respected commander.

91
00:12:14,876 --> 00:12:18,045
His troops are loyal
and battle-tested.

92
00:12:18,479 --> 00:12:22,115
He's hired thousands of foreign
sellswords to bolster his army.

93
00:12:22,483 --> 00:12:25,285
But this storm is a stroke
of luck for us northerners.

94
00:12:27,321 --> 00:12:30,090
Our people are used
to fighting in the frost.

95
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:35,094
His army is out there now
suffering in the snow.

96
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:38,298
One day I'll be
Lord of Winterfell

97
00:12:38,566 --> 00:12:40,567
and Warden of the North.

98
00:12:40,834 --> 00:12:42,935
You'll be my lady and Wardeness.

99
00:12:46,407 --> 00:12:48,241
But isn't
your stepmother pregnant?

100
00:12:48,442 --> 00:12:51,210
What of it?

101
00:12:51,477 --> 00:12:53,179
What happens if she has a boy?

102
00:12:54,948 --> 00:12:56,448
Then I'll have a baby brother.

103
00:12:56,683 --> 00:12:58,050
But he'll be the heir.

104
00:12:58,318 --> 00:13:00,319
I'm Lord Bolton's eldest son.

105
00:13:00,587 --> 00:13:01,854
But you're a bastard.

106
00:13:02,189 --> 00:13:04,857
A trueborn will always
have the stronger claim.

107
00:13:08,094 --> 00:13:10,429
I've been naturalized
by a royal decree from...

108
00:13:10,697 --> 00:13:13,665
Tommen Baratheon?
Another bastard.

109
00:13:20,707 --> 00:13:23,575
Bastards can rise
high in the world.

110
00:13:23,876 --> 00:13:26,644
Like your half-brother
Jon Snow.

111
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:30,615
Born the bastard of Winterfell,

112
00:13:30,983 --> 00:13:33,618
now the Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch.

113
00:13:35,654 --> 00:13:37,822
You didn't know?

114
00:13:38,157 --> 00:13:40,991
Yes, he's done
very well for himself.

115
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:42,760
Oh.

116
00:13:43,128 --> 00:13:45,363
I nearly forgot why
I asked you to join me.

117
00:13:45,564 --> 00:13:46,997
Come, my lady.

118
00:13:58,676 --> 00:14:00,244
<i>Your northern friend.</i>

119
00:14:03,681 --> 00:14:05,949
Reek told me
you wanted to leave.

120
00:14:06,084 --> 00:14:07,517
Why?

121
00:14:07,752 --> 00:14:09,153
Winterfell is your home

122
00:14:09,387 --> 00:14:11,755
and I am your husband.

123
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:13,657
Tough old bird.

124
00:14:13,991 --> 00:14:16,092
Everyone talks
when I start peeling them.

125
00:14:16,327 --> 00:14:18,495
But this one,

126
00:14:18,862 --> 00:14:21,331
her heart gave out before
I even got to her face.

127
00:14:23,834 --> 00:14:26,736
We do breed them tough
in the North.

128
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:35,477
Bring my wife
back to her chamber.

129
00:14:35,779 --> 00:14:37,880
It's far too cold
out here for a lady.

130
00:14:38,182 --> 00:14:40,950
You should hold on
to your candles.

131
00:14:41,218 --> 00:14:44,053
The nights are so long now.

132
00:15:34,002 --> 00:15:36,270
<i>40 horses
died in the night.</i>

133
00:15:36,571 --> 00:15:39,106
We'll lose more come sunset.

134
00:15:39,407 --> 00:15:40,674
We're running out of food.

135
00:15:41,076 --> 00:15:43,443
We can't open the supply
line until the snow clears.

136
00:15:48,783 --> 00:15:49,783
What else?

137
00:15:50,018 --> 00:15:52,986
The Stormcrows
rode off last night.

138
00:15:56,357 --> 00:15:57,924
500 men.

139
00:16:01,161 --> 00:16:03,196
Sellswords.

140
00:16:03,464 --> 00:16:05,632
Loyal to nothing but gold.

141
00:16:09,603 --> 00:16:11,871
We still have a hard
march to Winterfell

142
00:16:12,273 --> 00:16:13,306
and we won't be marching
anywhere in this weather.

143
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:15,108
And?

144
00:16:15,342 --> 00:16:16,675
This isn't our time.

145
00:16:17,111 --> 00:16:20,246
We should head back to Castle
Black when the snow clears.

146
00:16:20,614 --> 00:16:22,782
I retreated from
King's Landing, Ser Davos.

147
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:26,251
If I retreat again,
I'll become the King Who Ran.

148
00:16:26,553 --> 00:16:28,353
- Your Grace...
- Winter is coming.

149
00:16:28,722 --> 00:16:31,390
Those aren't just the Stark words.
It's a fact.

150
00:16:31,691 --> 00:16:34,393
If we march
back to Castle Black,

151
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:36,695
we winter at Castle Black.

152
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,697
And who can say how many years

153
00:16:38,965 --> 00:16:40,466
this winter will last?

154
00:16:40,867 --> 00:16:42,600
It's better to wait for the right
time than risk everything.

155
00:16:42,969 --> 00:16:44,929
This is the right time
and I will risk everything.

156
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:48,206
Because if I don't, we've lost.

157
00:16:48,408 --> 00:16:50,342
We march to victory

158
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:54,246
or we march to defeat.

159
00:16:54,547 --> 00:16:56,848
But we go forward.
Only forward.

160
00:17:06,826 --> 00:17:08,526
Your Grace.

161
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:15,599
I've trusted in your visions

162
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:18,735
and your prophecies for years.

163
00:17:19,004 --> 00:17:21,505
You saw it yourself, my king,

164
00:17:21,773 --> 00:17:23,441
when you stared into the flames.

165
00:17:23,741 --> 00:17:24,875
<i>A great battle in the snow.</i>

166
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,111
- I don't know what I saw.
- <i>You do know.</i>

167
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:28,346
Trust yourself.

168
00:17:28,613 --> 00:17:30,514
And you?
Do you trust yourself?

169
00:17:30,748 --> 00:17:33,016
I trust in the Lord.

170
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,788
Are you sure?

171
00:17:43,561 --> 00:17:46,797
I have seen myself walk along
the battlements of Winterfell.

172
00:17:47,231 --> 00:17:51,801
I have seen the flayed man
banners lowered to the ground.

173
00:18:00,611 --> 00:18:04,047
But sometimes sacrifices must
be made to ensure victory.

174
00:18:06,249 --> 00:18:09,485
I have shown you
the power of king's blood.

175
00:18:09,753 --> 00:18:10,820
The usurper Robb Stark.

176
00:18:11,121 --> 00:18:13,222
The usurper Joffrey Baratheon.

177
00:18:13,557 --> 00:18:15,625
We don't have
Robert's bastard here.

178
00:18:15,926 --> 00:18:19,261
No, we have someone better.

179
00:18:21,097 --> 00:18:23,132
And your blood
runs through her veins.

180
00:18:24,967 --> 00:18:26,735
Have you lost your mind?

181
00:18:26,936 --> 00:18:28,370
Do you doubt me?

182
00:18:28,571 --> 00:18:30,906
Still?

183
00:18:31,174 --> 00:18:32,741
After all that you've seen.

184
00:18:33,009 --> 00:18:34,476
There must be another way.

185
00:18:34,777 --> 00:18:37,079
- Leeches or...
- There is only one way.

186
00:18:37,447 --> 00:18:41,049
You must become king
before the Long Night begins.

187
00:18:41,417 --> 00:18:43,218
Only you can lead
the living against the dead.

188
00:18:43,485 --> 00:18:46,621
All your life has led us
to this moment.

189
00:18:46,956 --> 00:18:49,024
- To this decision.
- She's my daughter.

190
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:53,494
Get out.

191
00:19:15,784 --> 00:19:17,184
There's always
some sort of grub on.

192
00:19:17,485 --> 00:19:19,386
A bit of mutton would be nice.

193
00:19:23,058 --> 00:19:26,927
A beauty from beyond the Wall.

194
00:19:27,361 --> 00:19:29,881
Where you going, love? Aren't we
better-looking than the fat man?

195
00:19:29,897 --> 00:19:32,665
No, the question is is she pretty
down south in the real world

196
00:19:33,033 --> 00:19:34,953
or is she pretty 'cause
she's the only girl here?

197
00:19:34,969 --> 00:19:36,636
Even in White Harbor,
I'd want a kiss.

198
00:19:36,904 --> 00:19:39,672
Come on, love, give us a kiss.

199
00:19:40,174 --> 00:19:42,576
- Leave me alone. - Oh, if you were my girl,
I wouldn't leave you alone.

200
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:44,110
- One little kiss.
- Come on, give him a kiss.

201
00:19:44,411 --> 00:19:46,479
A man gets lonely
guarding the Wall.

202
00:19:51,184 --> 00:19:52,384
There's no need to be rude.

203
00:19:52,685 --> 00:19:54,453
We just want a little affection.

204
00:19:54,687 --> 00:19:57,156
Ooh.

205
00:19:58,658 --> 00:20:00,459
Get your hands off her.

206
00:20:00,727 --> 00:20:03,194
Brother Derek, Brother Brant,

207
00:20:03,529 --> 00:20:05,363
I believe you both
have guard duty tonight.

208
00:20:05,564 --> 00:20:06,965
Sam the Slayer.

209
00:20:07,266 --> 00:20:08,587
You gonna slay me
with that sword?

210
00:20:08,835 --> 00:20:10,002
<i>Look at his hand shake.</i>

211
00:20:10,202 --> 00:20:12,037
Gilly, go on.

212
00:20:12,371 --> 00:20:14,272
Get back to your room,
lock the door.

213
00:20:17,776 --> 00:20:19,377
- I'm warning you.
- Come on.

214
00:20:19,545 --> 00:20:21,212
Come on.

215
00:20:24,883 --> 00:20:26,451
Sam!

216
00:20:26,718 --> 00:20:29,020
You lying sack of shit.

217
00:20:29,355 --> 00:20:30,821
<i>Killed a white walker, eh?</i>

218
00:20:31,123 --> 00:20:33,324
You fat-ass fuck.

219
00:20:33,559 --> 00:20:35,025
Come on, get up.

220
00:20:35,393 --> 00:20:37,761
<i>- No!
- This your hero? This hog?</i>

221
00:20:37,962 --> 00:20:40,864
Leave him alone!

222
00:20:41,232 --> 00:20:43,400
Stubborn little wildling
bitch, aren't you?

223
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:47,604
- Come on!
- No!

224
00:20:47,872 --> 00:20:50,641
- Sam! Sam! Sam!
- Come on!

225
00:20:59,784 --> 00:21:01,885
- Sam! Sam!
- Come on.

226
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:03,753
<i>- Right.</i>

227
00:21:04,121 --> 00:21:06,389
<i>I'll deal with this.</i>

228
00:21:08,325 --> 00:21:10,226
<i>- Turn her over.
- All right.</i>

229
00:21:12,296 --> 00:21:15,498
I said get your hands off her.

230
00:21:15,832 --> 00:21:17,393
You're gonna
get yourself killed.

231
00:21:17,467 --> 00:21:19,535
Your lover Jon Snow's
not here to save you.

232
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:22,271
I killed a white walker,
I killed a Thenn.

233
00:21:22,573 --> 00:21:25,140
I'll take my chances with you.

234
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:43,357
<i>Sam!</i>

235
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:47,228
- I'm all right.
- You're not.

236
00:21:47,462 --> 00:21:49,831
Just a bit woozy.

237
00:22:14,722 --> 00:22:17,162
The next time you see something
like that, you leave it alone.

238
00:22:17,458 --> 00:22:20,193
<i>I will not.
They would have...</i>

239
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:25,365
I don't know what
they would have done.

240
00:22:25,733 --> 00:22:27,901
I know they would have killed
you if Ghost hadn't come.

241
00:22:28,202 --> 00:22:31,036
No. No, no.
They were tiring out.

242
00:22:31,337 --> 00:22:33,839
I had them
in the palm of my hand.

243
00:22:35,075 --> 00:22:37,109
Don't be stupid, Sam.

244
00:22:37,343 --> 00:22:40,012
You're not a fighter.

245
00:22:40,313 --> 00:22:41,546
What kind of man would I be

246
00:22:41,882 --> 00:22:44,183
if I ran away when I saw
someone hurting you?

247
00:22:44,384 --> 00:22:46,852
Just promise me

248
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:49,655
whatever happens, you'll
take care of Little Sam.

249
00:22:49,889 --> 00:22:51,623
But of course I will.

250
00:22:51,824 --> 00:22:54,025
And...

251
00:22:54,327 --> 00:22:56,528
I'll take care of you, too.

252
00:23:03,068 --> 00:23:04,669
I need more water.

253
00:23:08,507 --> 00:23:10,675
Stay.

254
00:23:10,876 --> 00:23:12,576
<i>Please?</i>

255
00:24:12,902 --> 00:24:14,336
Am I hurting you?

256
00:24:18,274 --> 00:24:19,675
Are you sure?

257
00:24:49,137 --> 00:24:51,539
Oh, my!

258
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:11,570
<i>A rare find for the
fighting pits, my friends.</i>

259
00:25:11,793 --> 00:25:15,629
Not your usual street tough
or drunken pirate.

260
00:25:15,897 --> 00:25:19,032
This one's a Westerosi knight

261
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:23,336
from an ancient house
trained in sword and lance.

262
00:25:23,638 --> 00:25:25,906
He fought beside
the stag king Robert

263
00:25:26,206 --> 00:25:27,741
on the far side
of the Narrow Sea.

264
00:25:28,175 --> 00:25:31,010
He was first through the breach
during the Siege of Spike,

265
00:25:31,345 --> 00:25:34,480
slaughtering 50 men
with his flaming sword.

266
00:25:34,848 --> 00:25:38,617
He killed the great Khal
Drogo in single combat.

267
00:25:38,852 --> 00:25:40,987
Betrayed by his woman,

268
00:25:41,355 --> 00:25:44,590
he sold himself into slavery
to repay his debts.

269
00:25:45,025 --> 00:25:48,527
<i>Bidding begins at 12 gold honors.</i>

270
00:25:48,762 --> 00:25:51,997
13.
Do I have 14?

271
00:25:52,231 --> 00:25:55,968
15?
15 gold honors.

272
00:25:56,202 --> 00:25:59,338
Do I hear 16?
16?

273
00:25:59,506 --> 00:26:01,206
20.

274
00:26:01,374 --> 00:26:02,675
Sold.

275
00:26:12,385 --> 00:26:15,020
Wait! You have
to buy me as well.

276
00:26:15,188 --> 00:26:16,588
Why?

277
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:19,124
We're a team.

278
00:26:19,392 --> 00:26:20,859
I'm a great fighter, too.

279
00:26:24,363 --> 00:26:26,898
He's funny.
You have to give him that.

280
00:26:53,992 --> 00:26:56,660
You're right, he's funny.

281
00:27:04,101 --> 00:27:05,502
Thank you, my lord.
Thank you.

282
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:06,870
Yes.

283
00:27:07,104 --> 00:27:09,105
My lord, if I may.

284
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,341
I've heard Meereen
has become a free city.

285
00:27:11,809 --> 00:27:14,729
You might run into trouble if you try
to fight slaves in the fighting pits.

286
00:27:14,745 --> 00:27:17,065
Now, if you were to fight freed
men who'd be paid a wage...

287
00:27:20,284 --> 00:27:22,052
There's your wages, funny man.

288
00:27:22,353 --> 00:27:24,687
Should last the rest
of your life.

289
00:27:26,357 --> 00:27:29,158
These are warrior
hands, not a serving girl's.

290
00:27:29,359 --> 00:27:30,960
5, going once...

291
00:27:35,432 --> 00:27:38,434
How long before the King of
Meereen comes to claim my pillow?

292
00:27:38,669 --> 00:27:40,235
Don't be ridiculous.

293
00:27:40,537 --> 00:27:44,306
My marriage to Hizdahr
is political.

294
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,675
I think he's smart enough
to understand that.

295
00:27:48,778 --> 00:27:50,738
I think the Sons of the
Harpy have stopped killing

296
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:52,714
because their leader
was made king.

297
00:27:55,718 --> 00:27:57,919
Are you jealous?

298
00:27:58,321 --> 00:28:00,556
You think I'm petty enough
to speak ill of a man

299
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:02,891
just because he
represents competition?

300
00:28:03,059 --> 00:28:04,926
I do.

301
00:28:06,729 --> 00:28:08,296
You're right.

302
00:28:08,564 --> 00:28:11,365
My motivations
are entirely impure.

303
00:28:20,242 --> 00:28:21,875
Doesn't make me wrong.

304
00:28:26,681 --> 00:28:30,451
You told me yourself I can't fight
enemies within and without.

305
00:28:30,752 --> 00:28:32,987
So when enemies without
come knocking,

306
00:28:33,322 --> 00:28:35,055
I need the city
of Meereen behind me.

307
00:28:35,256 --> 00:28:37,691
I have no choice.

308
00:28:37,926 --> 00:28:39,292
Everyone has a choice.

309
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,961
Even slaves
have a choice...

310
00:28:41,195 --> 00:28:42,796
Death or slavery.

311
00:28:43,064 --> 00:28:45,699
So what else can I do, hmm?

312
00:28:47,702 --> 00:28:49,703
Marry me instead.

313
00:28:51,272 --> 00:28:55,575
Even if I wanted to do
such an inadvisable thing,

314
00:28:55,776 --> 00:28:57,144
I couldn't.

315
00:28:57,345 --> 00:28:58,945
Why not?

316
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,947
You are queen.
You can do what you like.

317
00:29:03,384 --> 00:29:06,819
No, I can't.

318
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:09,622
Then you are the only person
in Meereen who's not free.

319
00:29:21,068 --> 00:29:25,304
And I know I'm here to serve
my queen and not give advice,

320
00:29:25,605 --> 00:29:27,606
but can I make
one more suggestion?

321
00:29:31,711 --> 00:29:33,712
Of course.

322
00:29:36,249 --> 00:29:38,784
On the day of the great games,

323
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:41,653
gather all the Great
Masters and Wise Masters

324
00:29:41,954 --> 00:29:44,890
and Worthy Masters you can find

325
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:46,624
and slaughter them all.

326
00:29:50,429 --> 00:29:53,765
I am a queen, not a butcher.

327
00:29:58,737 --> 00:30:01,673
All rulers are either
butchers or meat.

328
00:30:10,816 --> 00:30:13,984
You there. Where would
I find the High Septon

329
00:30:14,419 --> 00:30:17,354
or High Sparrow or whatever
bloody fool name he's got?

330
00:30:17,756 --> 00:30:21,192
It's not as good a name as
Queen of Thorns, I'll admit.

331
00:30:22,861 --> 00:30:24,561
You should have the decency

332
00:30:24,863 --> 00:30:26,931
to stand when
you speak to a lady.

333
00:30:27,332 --> 00:30:29,799
You should have the decency
to kneel before the gods.

334
00:30:30,101 --> 00:30:31,422
Don't spar with me,
little fellow.

335
00:30:34,672 --> 00:30:37,441
For me, it's the knees.

336
00:30:37,642 --> 00:30:39,376
- You?
- Hips.

337
00:30:39,544 --> 00:30:41,445
Ah.

338
00:30:41,779 --> 00:30:45,449
A man of the people.
Is that your game?

339
00:30:45,783 --> 00:30:49,085
It's an old game.
Dull and unconvincing.

340
00:30:49,319 --> 00:30:51,454
A man of the people

341
00:30:51,789 --> 00:30:54,124
who does Cersei's
dirty work for her.

342
00:30:55,559 --> 00:30:57,227
The people always
do the dirty work.

343
00:30:57,661 --> 00:31:00,163
Spare me the homilies. I can
smell a fraud from a mile away.

344
00:31:00,364 --> 00:31:01,631
Useful talent.

345
00:31:01,966 --> 00:31:04,600
I'm here for my grandson
and granddaughter.

346
00:31:04,901 --> 00:31:07,136
Your grandson and granddaughter

347
00:31:07,404 --> 00:31:10,439
swore sacred vows and lied.

348
00:31:10,707 --> 00:31:12,908
The Father judges us all.

349
00:31:13,143 --> 00:31:15,278
Sons of high lords,

350
00:31:15,512 --> 00:31:17,446
sons of fishermen.

351
00:31:17,814 --> 00:31:20,715
If you break his laws,
you will be punished.

352
00:31:21,985 --> 00:31:23,451
Don't you walk away from me.

353
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:25,487
You don't give commands
here, Lady Olenna.

354
00:31:25,721 --> 00:31:27,122
What is it you want?

355
00:31:27,323 --> 00:31:29,224
Gold?

356
00:31:29,592 --> 00:31:32,194
I'll make you the richest
septon who ever lived.

357
00:31:33,763 --> 00:31:36,063
What, then?

358
00:31:36,365 --> 00:31:39,000
I imagine this
is strange for you.

359
00:31:39,335 --> 00:31:41,636
Everyone you meet
has a hidden motive

360
00:31:42,004 --> 00:31:45,006
and you pride yourself
on sniffing it out.

361
00:31:45,341 --> 00:31:47,275
<i>But I'm telling you
a simple truth.</i>

362
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:49,711
I serve the gods.

363
00:31:49,945 --> 00:31:51,646
The gods demand justice.

364
00:31:51,947 --> 00:31:54,182
How do they communicate
their demands?

365
00:31:54,416 --> 00:31:55,950
By raven or horse?

366
00:31:56,285 --> 00:31:58,986
By the holy text,
"The Seven-Pointed Star."

367
00:31:59,288 --> 00:32:01,422
If you don't have one
in your library,

368
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:02,690
<i>I'll give you my own.</i>

369
00:32:03,025 --> 00:32:05,259
I've read
"The Seven-Pointed Star."

370
00:32:05,727 --> 00:32:09,663
<i>Then you'll remember the passages
concerning buggery and perjury.</i>

371
00:32:09,964 --> 00:32:12,065
Your grandchildren
will be punished

372
00:32:12,467 --> 00:32:16,670
in the same manner as anyone
who breaks the sacred laws.

373
00:32:16,971 --> 00:32:18,305
Half the men,
women, and children

374
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,809
in this foul city
break the sacred laws.

375
00:32:22,143 --> 00:32:25,145
You live among murderers,
thieves, and rapists,

376
00:32:25,412 --> 00:32:27,113
and yet you punish Loras

377
00:32:27,414 --> 00:32:30,683
for shagging some perfumed ponce

378
00:32:30,985 --> 00:32:32,886
and Margaery for defending
her brother?

379
00:32:33,287 --> 00:32:37,324
Yes. The gods' laws must
be applied to all equally.

380
00:32:37,624 --> 00:32:40,060
If it's equality
you want, so be it.

381
00:32:40,461 --> 00:32:44,063
When House Tyrell stops sending
our crops to the capital,

382
00:32:44,297 --> 00:32:46,298
everyone here will starve.

383
00:32:46,667 --> 00:32:49,369
And I'll make sure the
hungry know who's to blame.

384
00:32:52,673 --> 00:32:55,341
Have you ever sowed the
field, Lady Olenna?

385
00:32:57,811 --> 00:33:00,612
Have you ever reaped the grain?

386
00:33:00,914 --> 00:33:02,447
Has anyone in House Tyrell?

387
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:05,617
A lifetime of wealth and power

388
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:07,452
has left you blind in one eye.

389
00:33:09,756 --> 00:33:13,458
You are the few,
we are the many.

390
00:33:15,361 --> 00:33:18,764
And when the many
stop fearing the few...

391
00:33:33,045 --> 00:33:35,613
Lady Olenna.

392
00:33:46,725 --> 00:33:48,405
Starving yourself
won't make things

393
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:50,828
any better for her, my love.

394
00:33:53,498 --> 00:33:55,299
She's in a prison cell

395
00:33:55,567 --> 00:33:58,335
and there is nothing I can do.

396
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:03,340
I am the king!

397
00:34:03,742 --> 00:34:06,676
The queen is in prison and
there is nothing I can do!

398
00:34:21,091 --> 00:34:24,427
No matter who you are,

399
00:34:24,762 --> 00:34:26,663
no matter how strong
you are, sooner or later,

400
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:29,131
you'll face circumstances
beyond your control.

401
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:32,201
Events you couldn't
possibly have anticipated

402
00:34:32,503 --> 00:34:33,903
or prevented even if you had.

403
00:34:34,204 --> 00:34:37,006
You cannot blame
yourself for fate.

404
00:34:37,207 --> 00:34:39,575
Your father,

405
00:34:39,876 --> 00:34:41,310
your brother,
your grandfather...

406
00:34:41,711 --> 00:34:44,613
I was Queen of the Seven
Kingdoms and what could I do?

407
00:34:44,914 --> 00:34:47,283
Hold them as they
left this world.

408
00:34:47,584 --> 00:34:49,251
Kissed their heads
after they'd gone.

409
00:34:49,519 --> 00:34:51,553
I'll call in the army.

410
00:34:51,788 --> 00:34:53,689
I'll take back the sept

411
00:34:53,957 --> 00:34:57,192
and kill every last one of them.

412
00:34:59,261 --> 00:35:01,530
I'll start a war if I have to.

413
00:35:01,965 --> 00:35:05,133
You know as well as I do who the
first casualty of that war would be.

414
00:35:10,072 --> 00:35:12,073
I love her.

415
00:35:15,144 --> 00:35:17,212
I love her...

416
00:35:19,715 --> 00:35:21,116
and I can't help her.

417
00:35:37,232 --> 00:35:38,633
We must be strong
for those we love.

418
00:35:38,934 --> 00:35:40,935
We cannot give in to despair.

419
00:35:41,236 --> 00:35:44,004
I will speak
with the High Sparrow.

420
00:35:44,272 --> 00:35:45,572
There must be
something he...

421
00:35:45,907 --> 00:35:48,008
Let me talk to him
on your behalf.

422
00:35:48,476 --> 00:35:51,811
The king cannot sully himself
negotiating with an unwashed fanatic.

423
00:35:53,348 --> 00:35:55,215
You will try to help her?

424
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:58,652
I'll do everything I can to win
her freedom and her brother's.

425
00:35:58,986 --> 00:36:01,688
Your happiness is all
I want in this world.

426
00:36:02,957 --> 00:36:05,759
- I know.
- No, you don't.

427
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:11,197
You can't possibly.

428
00:36:13,333 --> 00:36:15,802
Not until you have
children of your own.

429
00:36:16,103 --> 00:36:18,504
I would do anything for you.

430
00:36:20,107 --> 00:36:22,341
Anything to keep you from harm.

431
00:36:25,011 --> 00:36:27,012
I would burn cities
to the ground.

432
00:36:28,815 --> 00:36:32,085
You are all that matters.

433
00:36:32,319 --> 00:36:36,055
You and your sister.

434
00:36:36,355 --> 00:36:39,124
From the moment you came
into this world.

435
00:36:39,325 --> 00:36:41,627
My boy.

436
00:36:44,064 --> 00:36:46,065
My only boy.

437
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:02,680
Prince Doran hopes
this satisfies

438
00:37:03,048 --> 00:37:05,417
your concerns about the
princess's well-being.

439
00:37:12,658 --> 00:37:14,425
You looked different
when I left.

440
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:16,728
You had more hair.

441
00:37:16,929 --> 00:37:19,864
And more hands.

442
00:37:20,198 --> 00:37:22,500
- How's Trystane?
- He'll be all right.

443
00:37:22,734 --> 00:37:23,734
I'm sorry for that.

444
00:37:24,035 --> 00:37:25,515
It wasn't supposed
to happen that way.

445
00:37:25,537 --> 00:37:27,070
Why is it happening at all?

446
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:31,074
Your mother's worried about you.

447
00:37:31,343 --> 00:37:33,511
Threats have been made.

448
00:37:33,778 --> 00:37:35,045
Dorne's too dangerous for you.

449
00:37:35,413 --> 00:37:37,481
- I've come to take you home.
- This is my home.

450
00:37:37,749 --> 00:37:39,149
This has been my home for years.

451
00:37:39,517 --> 00:37:41,451
I didn't want to come here,
but she told me to.

452
00:37:41,686 --> 00:37:42,686
I did what she said.

453
00:37:43,021 --> 00:37:45,287
I did my duty and now
she's forcing me to go back?

454
00:37:45,689 --> 00:37:48,423
It's for your own good.
These are complicated matters.

455
00:37:48,792 --> 00:37:50,893
<i>No, it's not complicated at all.
It's simple.</i>

456
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:53,195
I love Trystane,
I'm going to marry him,

457
00:37:53,463 --> 00:37:54,764
and we're staying right here.

458
00:37:55,098 --> 00:37:56,532
- I don't understand.
- Of course you don't.

459
00:37:56,767 --> 00:37:58,734
You don't know me.

460
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:11,012
<i>♪ Brothers, O brothers,
my days here are done ♪</i>

461

466
00:38:32,835 --> 00:38:35,703
He's got a good voice.

467
00:38:35,970 --> 00:38:37,505
We're lucky he's a singer.

468
00:38:37,906 --> 00:38:40,007
If he were a fighter, we
might have been in trouble.

469
00:38:40,309 --> 00:38:43,244
It's against my code
to hurt a woman.

470
00:38:43,645 --> 00:38:46,280
It's amazing how many men we
beat seem to have this code.

471
00:38:46,582 --> 00:38:48,015
I wouldn't say you beat me.

472
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:49,750
How's your arm?

473
00:38:49,951 --> 00:38:51,752
Wonderful.

474
00:38:52,153 --> 00:38:54,822
Wouldn't feel right to leave
Dorne without a new scar.

475
00:38:55,156 --> 00:38:56,957
You think you're leaving Dorne?

476
00:38:57,158 --> 00:38:59,026
No great hurry.

477
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:01,895
Dornish women are the most
beautiful women in the world.

478
00:39:02,097 --> 00:39:03,163
Thank you.

479
00:39:03,497 --> 00:39:06,366
I said Dornish women.
I didn't say you.

480
00:39:09,303 --> 00:39:11,638
I'm not the most beautiful
woman you've ever seen?

481
00:39:13,474 --> 00:39:14,795
<i>I've seen
quite a few women</i>

482
00:39:14,942 --> 00:39:15,982
<i>in all the Seven Kingdoms.</i>

483
00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:19,546
Name one more beautiful
than I am.

484
00:39:21,682 --> 00:39:24,751
Well, now, in King's Landing,

485
00:39:25,052 --> 00:39:28,354
<i>there was an absolutely
gorgeous...</i>

486
00:39:32,793 --> 00:39:34,026
There was a what?

487
00:39:36,730 --> 00:39:39,498
In King's Landing,
you were saying?

488
00:39:39,666 --> 00:39:41,433
Was I?

489
00:39:41,801 --> 00:39:44,603
There was a woman
more beautiful than I am.

490
00:39:44,804 --> 00:39:46,372
Was there?

491
00:39:46,673 --> 00:39:48,574
My memory's not
what it was earlier.

492
00:39:52,245 --> 00:39:53,612
How's your arm now?

493
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,381
You seem concerned with it.

494
00:39:55,649 --> 00:39:57,482
<i>You must really like me.</i>

495
00:40:06,192 --> 00:40:09,060
And how about your head?

496
00:40:13,699 --> 00:40:15,667
<i>My head?</i>

497
00:40:15,867 --> 00:40:18,002
My head?

498
00:40:18,370 --> 00:40:20,838
You don't even want to
know what's going on in...

499
00:40:31,249 --> 00:40:33,217
Your nose is bleeding.

500
00:40:36,421 --> 00:40:38,789
It's nothing.
It's the dry air.

501
00:40:42,127 --> 00:40:46,530
My dagger was coated with a
special ointment from Asshai.

502
00:40:46,864 --> 00:40:49,098
<i>They call it the Long Farewell.</i>

503
00:40:49,367 --> 00:40:51,335
It takes time to work,

504
00:40:51,703 --> 00:40:55,439
but if a single drop
makes contact with the skin,

505
00:40:55,606 --> 00:40:56,606
death.

506
00:41:05,049 --> 00:41:07,150
The only antidote.

507
00:41:12,223 --> 00:41:14,490
Who's the most beautiful
woman in the world?

508
00:41:15,926 --> 00:41:17,160
You.

509
00:41:18,462 --> 00:41:20,929
Sorry? Who?

510
00:41:22,833 --> 00:41:25,468
You.

511
00:41:25,669 --> 00:41:27,436
Don't drop it.

512
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:44,086
I think you're
very handsome as well.

513
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:31,498
- I'm sorry about the locale.
- No, you're not.

514
00:42:34,201 --> 00:42:36,102
It felt like the safest place.

515
00:42:36,370 --> 00:42:38,338
Not for your clientele, clearly.

516
00:42:39,407 --> 00:42:41,642
It was an establishment
like no other.

517
00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:44,978
The sheer range
of appetites catered to.

518
00:42:45,246 --> 00:42:46,779
Desires that didn't even exist

519
00:42:47,014 --> 00:42:49,782
until we invented them.

520
00:42:50,217 --> 00:42:52,986
You've always been rather impressed
with yourself, haven't you?

521
00:42:54,388 --> 00:42:57,123
The past is the past.

522
00:42:57,491 --> 00:43:00,593
The future is all
that's worth discussing.

523
00:43:02,262 --> 00:43:03,729
The future of House Tyrell.

524
00:43:04,097 --> 00:43:06,532
Don't pretend to have
any concern for my house,

525
00:43:06,767 --> 00:43:08,334
my grandchildren or me.

526
00:43:08,702 --> 00:43:11,036
I should have known
you'd return to the capital

527
00:43:11,371 --> 00:43:13,305
as soon as things
started to go wrong.

528
00:43:13,707 --> 00:43:15,627
- I promise you...
- I promise you, Lord Baelish,

529
00:43:15,875 --> 00:43:17,742
that our fates are joined.

530
00:43:18,011 --> 00:43:19,578
Together we murdered a king.

531
00:43:19,946 --> 00:43:23,248
If my house should fall,
I will have nothing to hide.

532
00:43:24,617 --> 00:43:27,719
And if I should meet
with some accident

533
00:43:28,054 --> 00:43:30,922
here at your broken
little flesh market,

534
00:43:31,257 --> 00:43:34,325
they'll never even find
what's left of you.

535
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:36,995
So...

536
00:43:37,262 --> 00:43:39,063
do you deny a part in all this?

537
00:43:39,365 --> 00:43:42,266
Cersei summoned me
to King's Landing.

538
00:43:42,535 --> 00:43:43,902
I dared not refuse her.

539
00:43:44,136 --> 00:43:45,637
And what did she want?

540
00:43:45,972 --> 00:43:48,806
A piece of information
she knew that I had.

541
00:43:49,108 --> 00:43:52,443
Neither silence
nor lies were an option.

542
00:43:52,744 --> 00:43:55,079
But I have other information

543
00:43:55,314 --> 00:43:56,714
of which she is unaware.

544
00:43:58,617 --> 00:44:01,085
And as you say,
our interests are aligned.

545
00:44:03,222 --> 00:44:04,955
I have a gift for you.

546
00:44:05,156 --> 00:44:06,590
What kind of gift?

547
00:44:06,892 --> 00:44:09,927
The same kind I gave Cersei.

548
00:44:10,161 --> 00:44:11,829
A handsome young man.

549
00:44:26,110 --> 00:44:28,478
<i>Many worthy
fighters have died</i>

550
00:44:28,812 --> 00:44:30,914
<i>trying to make it
to the great games.</i>

551
00:44:31,349 --> 00:44:34,084
When most of you worthless scum
join them in death this afternoon,

552
00:44:34,485 --> 00:44:37,354
it will represent a significant
rise in your station.

553
00:44:37,655 --> 00:44:40,289
But if you do happen
to triumph here,

554
00:44:40,691 --> 00:44:43,092
<i>you will fight at the Great
Pit of Daznak itself</i>

555
00:44:43,326 --> 00:44:44,694
<i>in front of the queen.</i>

556
00:44:45,128 --> 00:44:49,065
So whatever happens, the gods
have smiled upon you today.

557
00:44:49,499 --> 00:44:53,369
This is the day your lives
actually start to mean something.

558
00:44:55,705 --> 00:44:58,140
You and you.
You.

559
00:44:59,609 --> 00:45:01,444
You two.

560
00:45:03,813 --> 00:45:05,147
<i>You, you, and you.</i>

561
00:45:06,149 --> 00:45:08,084
Up.

562
00:45:08,452 --> 00:45:11,053
<i>- Valar morghulis.
- Valar dohaeris.</i>

563
00:45:11,287 --> 00:45:13,121
Prepare yourselves.

564
00:45:25,401 --> 00:45:27,935
Sitting through the great
games will be bad enough.

565
00:45:28,370 --> 00:45:30,972
For generations in the days
leading up to the great games,

566
00:45:31,307 --> 00:45:32,668
it has been customary
for our ruler

567
00:45:32,841 --> 00:45:34,375
to make the rounds
of the lower pits

568
00:45:34,743 --> 00:45:36,877
to pay the fighters there
the honor of her presence.

569
00:45:40,816 --> 00:45:43,884
<i>Move yourselves.</i>

570
00:45:50,191 --> 00:45:51,558
Your Grace.

571
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:52,960
Your future Grace.

572
00:45:53,194 --> 00:45:55,395
You honor us all.

573
00:45:57,899 --> 00:46:00,067
Stand there.

574
00:46:00,401 --> 00:46:02,702
Stand straight.
That's the fucking queen.

575
00:46:04,739 --> 00:46:06,340
We fight and
die for your glory,

576
00:46:06,407 --> 00:46:08,275
O glorious queen.

577
00:46:11,112 --> 00:46:13,180
We fight and
die for your glory,

578
00:46:13,414 --> 00:46:15,048
<i>O glorious queen.</i>

579
00:46:16,684 --> 00:46:19,052
<i>Fight!</i>

580
00:47:17,577 --> 00:47:18,610
I think I've seen enough.

581
00:47:18,911 --> 00:47:21,613
Your Grace, it is a tradition

582
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:24,949
for the queen to stay
until the victor has emerged.

583
00:47:25,350 --> 00:47:27,430
I've sacrificed more than
enough for your traditions.

584
00:47:32,191 --> 00:47:33,591
What are you doing?

585
00:47:42,867 --> 00:47:44,547
Wait your turn,
you piece of fucking filth.

586
00:49:14,222 --> 00:49:15,689
Get him out of my sight.

587
00:49:15,924 --> 00:49:17,958
Khaleesi, please.

588
00:49:18,259 --> 00:49:20,393
I just need
a moment of your time.

589
00:49:20,628 --> 00:49:22,262
I brought you a gift.

590
00:49:23,531 --> 00:49:25,031
<i>It's true.</i>

591
00:49:26,434 --> 00:49:28,868
He has.

592
00:49:29,069 --> 00:49:30,737
Who are you?

593
00:49:32,072 --> 00:49:33,973
I am the gift.

594
00:49:36,109 --> 00:49:38,778
<i>It's a pleasure
to meet you, Your Grace.</i>

595
00:49:39,947 --> 00:49:41,948
My name is Tyrion Lannister.

596
00:50:15,114 --> 00:50:16,848
This is horrible.

597
00:50:17,083 --> 00:50:18,984
Unacceptable.

598
00:50:20,786 --> 00:50:22,988
Are they feeding you
enough at least?

599
00:50:24,357 --> 00:50:27,325
I brought you this.
Venison.

600
00:50:27,526 --> 00:50:29,494
It's quite good.

601
00:50:32,664 --> 00:50:35,433
I had it myself for supper
only last night.

602
00:50:39,671 --> 00:50:42,473
We did everything we could from the
moment they took your brother.

603
00:50:42,808 --> 00:50:44,609
Tommen even went
to the sept himself

604
00:50:44,877 --> 00:50:47,011
to confront the High Sparrow.

605
00:50:47,345 --> 00:50:50,080
But I fear the Faith
has left reason behind.

606
00:50:50,315 --> 00:50:53,150
I know you did this.

607
00:50:53,484 --> 00:50:56,987
We are making every effort
on your behalf.

608
00:50:57,289 --> 00:50:59,523
I swear to you
by all the seven gods.

609
00:50:59,791 --> 00:51:01,658
Lies come easily to you.

610
00:51:01,893 --> 00:51:03,327
Everyone knows that.

611
00:51:03,528 --> 00:51:06,262
<i>But innocence,</i>

612
00:51:06,497 --> 00:51:08,932
<i>decency, concern,</i>

613
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:11,701
you're not very good
at those, I'm afraid.

614
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:15,439
Perhaps that's why
your son was so eager

615
00:51:15,706 --> 00:51:17,340
to cast you aside for me.

616
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:21,544
You're upset.

617
00:51:21,845 --> 00:51:23,980
You're not thinking clearly.

618
00:51:24,381 --> 00:51:26,542
I'll visit again when you've
had a chance to calm down.

619
00:51:26,550 --> 00:51:28,284
I don't want to see you again.

620
00:51:28,652 --> 00:51:30,553
I do hope you change
your mind about that.

621
00:51:30,854 --> 00:51:33,256
I've been told men often go mad

622
00:51:33,557 --> 00:51:35,858
in the Black Cells
beneath the Red Keep.

623
00:51:36,193 --> 00:51:37,460
Though I suppose
your isolation will end

624
00:51:37,694 --> 00:51:39,829
when your trial begins.

625
00:51:41,264 --> 00:51:43,098
Leave.

626
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:44,934
Yes.

627
00:51:45,168 --> 00:51:46,602
I'm afraid I must.

628
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:48,704
<i>My son needs me now
more than ever.</i>

629
00:51:49,005 --> 00:51:51,340
Get out, you hateful bitch!

630
00:52:05,521 --> 00:52:07,356
Sleep well, sister.

631
00:52:35,117 --> 00:52:36,484
Thank you, Boake.

632
00:52:43,758 --> 00:52:45,258
- You saw her?
- Yes.

633
00:52:45,627 --> 00:52:48,028
- And?
- Her accommodations seem sufficient.

634
00:52:48,295 --> 00:52:50,430
What happens to her now?

635
00:52:50,765 --> 00:52:52,733
Well, she and her brother
are both being held

636
00:52:52,967 --> 00:52:54,768
under fair suspicion.

637
00:52:55,069 --> 00:52:57,203
A trial will be held
for each of them

638
00:52:57,505 --> 00:53:00,340
to determine if they're
guilty of any acts

639
00:53:00,774 --> 00:53:03,910
that might constitute a violation
of the tenets of the faith.

640
00:53:04,145 --> 00:53:05,811
Who will stand judge?

641
00:53:06,247 --> 00:53:09,982
Seven septons as it was in all
trials before the Targaryens.

642
00:53:11,618 --> 00:53:12,618
Will you be one of them?

643
00:53:12,753 --> 00:53:14,154
I will.

644
00:53:16,657 --> 00:53:18,457
If one or both of them

645
00:53:18,792 --> 00:53:21,027
were to confess
before the trial...

646
00:53:21,361 --> 00:53:23,195
Then they will be shown
the Mother's mercy.

647
00:53:24,497 --> 00:53:26,766
And what does
the Mother's mercy entail?

648
00:53:27,034 --> 00:53:29,134
It depends upon the situation.

649
00:53:29,502 --> 00:53:32,237
The acts themselves,
the degree of contrition.

650
00:53:32,505 --> 00:53:35,207
Thank you, High Septon,

651
00:53:35,608 --> 00:53:37,943
for bringing them whatever
justice they deserve

652
00:53:38,211 --> 00:53:40,812
<i>in the eyes of the Seven.</i>

653
00:53:44,984 --> 00:53:46,418
<i>Did you know this chapel</i>

654
00:53:46,819 --> 00:53:49,153
is one of the oldest
structures in King's Landing?

655
00:53:50,957 --> 00:53:53,124
I think I may have
heard at one point.

656
00:53:53,392 --> 00:53:55,994
Baelor built his sept around it.

657
00:53:57,663 --> 00:54:00,632
But men worshipped here
long before him.

658
00:54:00,866 --> 00:54:03,401
Who carved this altar?

659
00:54:03,703 --> 00:54:06,737
- Do you know?
- I'm afraid I don't.

660
00:54:06,905 --> 00:54:09,039
No one does.

661
00:54:09,408 --> 00:54:12,843
There's no name on it or
anywhere else in the chapel.

662
00:54:15,046 --> 00:54:17,181
No, the people
who built this place

663
00:54:17,549 --> 00:54:21,419
didn't inflict their vanity
on those who came after them

664
00:54:21,853 --> 00:54:25,255
the way Baelor did with that great
gilded monstrosity up there.

665
00:54:25,423 --> 00:54:26,991
Hmm.

666
00:54:27,225 --> 00:54:29,226
Their faith was clean.

667
00:54:30,729 --> 00:54:33,196
Strip away the gold
and the ornaments,

668
00:54:33,531 --> 00:54:36,934
knock down the statues
and the pillars,

669
00:54:37,201 --> 00:54:39,169
and this is what remains.

670
00:54:42,273 --> 00:54:44,674
Something simple...

671
00:54:48,045 --> 00:54:51,248
and solid and true.

672
00:54:55,953 --> 00:54:58,955
The Tyrells' finery
will be stripped away.

673
00:55:00,390 --> 00:55:02,058
<i>Their lies knocked down.</i>

674
00:55:02,425 --> 00:55:05,094
<i>Their true hearts
laid bare for all to see.</i>

675
00:55:06,563 --> 00:55:09,198
And so it will be for all of us.

676
00:55:09,432 --> 00:55:11,800
High and low alike.

677
00:55:16,039 --> 00:55:18,073
What will we find

678
00:55:18,375 --> 00:55:21,109
when we strip away your finery?

679
00:55:24,581 --> 00:55:27,816
A young man came to us
not long ago.

680
00:55:28,084 --> 00:55:30,752
Broken in body and spirit.

681
00:55:33,089 --> 00:55:35,157
He had so much to strip away.

682
00:55:37,226 --> 00:55:40,762
<i>So much weighing him down.</i>

683
00:55:41,130 --> 00:55:43,999
<i>But piece by piece,
he unburdened himself.</i>

684
00:55:45,668 --> 00:55:47,535
<i>Let go of vanity,</i>

685
00:55:47,736 --> 00:55:50,071
pride, sin.

686
00:55:52,808 --> 00:55:55,210
Now his soul is so light,

687
00:55:55,611 --> 00:55:58,446
he will float through the
Seven Heavens like a bird.

688
00:55:58,614 --> 00:56:00,081
Hmm.

689
00:56:05,286 --> 00:56:07,722
And he has much
to say about you.

690
00:56:32,012 --> 00:56:33,614
Move.

691
00:56:35,850 --> 00:56:38,251
Let me go immediately.

692
00:56:38,552 --> 00:56:41,221
You will order her to let me go.

693
00:56:41,521 --> 00:56:43,923
I am the queen!
I am the queen!

694
00:56:44,158 --> 00:56:45,625
Have you lost your mind?

695
00:56:45,826 --> 00:56:47,360
Let me go!

696
00:56:48,996 --> 00:56:50,896
<i>Get your filthy hands off me!</i>

697
00:56:51,164 --> 00:56:53,466
<i>Have you lost your mind?</i>

698
00:56:53,734 --> 00:56:56,302
<i>I am the queen!
Let me go!</i>

699
00:57:02,576 --> 00:57:04,243
Look at me.

700
00:57:06,913 --> 00:57:08,247
Look at my face.

701
00:57:11,550 --> 00:57:14,253
It's the last thing
you'll see before you die.

702
00:57:30,670 --> 00:57:38,670
