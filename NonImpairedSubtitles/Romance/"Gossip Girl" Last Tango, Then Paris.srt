1
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:20,572
So I guess now you know why I
don't talk to you about things.

2
00:00:20,607 --> 00:00:23,442
Thanks for coming with me.
You wanna talk about it?

3
00:00:23,476 --> 00:00:25,577
I don't see what's so wrong
about wanting my life

4
00:00:25,612 --> 00:00:28,447
To go back to normal. What needs
to get back to normal is you.

5
00:00:28,481 --> 00:00:31,684
I'll be waiting at the top
of the empire state building.

6
00:00:31,718 --> 00:00:34,753
At 7:01, I'm closing my heart to
you forever. Well, I won't be there.

00:00:55,641 --> 00:00:57,309
You reap what you sow.

9
00:00:57,310 --> 00:01:01,246
What goes around comes around.

10
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,882
No matter how far you run,

11
00:01:03,916 --> 00:01:06,117
You can never truly escape.

12
00:01:06,152 --> 00:01:07,819
âª I don't like you âª

13
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:09,955
Everything catches up to you
in the end,

14
00:01:09,989 --> 00:01:11,656
And when it does,

15
00:01:11,657 --> 00:01:13,625
It usually kicks your ass.

16
00:01:13,659 --> 00:01:15,493
âª...Always thinking of you âª

17
00:01:15,494 --> 00:01:16,661
Jenny?

18
00:01:18,497 --> 00:01:22,000
Rufus, teenage girls
are a nightmare.

19
00:01:22,034 --> 00:01:24,002
As soon as they realize

20
00:01:24,036 --> 00:01:26,271
That you'll love 'em
no matter what they do,

21
00:01:26,305 --> 00:01:28,273
You lose all of your power.

22
00:01:28,307 --> 00:01:30,842
You just have to wait
till they finish college.

23
00:01:30,876 --> 00:01:34,746
Or in the case of serena, rebel
and not go.

24
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:37,148
Just talk to her.
Is she in her room?

25
00:01:37,183 --> 00:01:40,151
No. I sent her to the loft
to stay with dan

26
00:01:40,186 --> 00:01:42,921
So I could consider
the best course of action.

27
00:01:42,955 --> 00:01:45,023
Well, grounding her again
probably won't work.

28
00:01:45,057 --> 00:01:47,025
Short of sending her away,

29
00:01:47,059 --> 00:01:49,027
I don't know nything else
that will.

30
00:01:49,061 --> 00:01:52,464
Well, I think
that would be a mistake.

31
00:01:52,498 --> 00:01:55,533
And I would hate to separate her
and eric. They need each other.

32
00:01:55,568 --> 00:01:58,703
Don't worry about me. After what
I witnessed yesterday,

33
00:01:58,738 --> 00:02:01,673
You can do whatever you want with
jenny what are you talking about?

34
00:02:01,707 --> 00:02:03,875
She's your sister. No, not by
choice. She said so herself.

35
00:02:03,909 --> 00:02:06,444
So go ahead
and send her crazy ass away.

36
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:09,447
Although if I were you, I'd do
it sooner rather than later,

37
00:02:09,482 --> 00:02:11,449
Before she hurts anybody else.

38
00:02:11,484 --> 00:02:14,452
âª

39
00:02:20,693 --> 00:02:22,027
Oh. Finally.

40
00:02:22,028 --> 00:02:25,130
jenny. Hey.
You're still here.

41
00:02:25,164 --> 00:02:27,132
Gee, thanks. As if it wasn't
humiliating enough

42
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:29,701
When you fell asleep
in the middle of my sentence.

43
00:02:29,735 --> 00:02:31,603
Don't you mean monolou?

44
00:02:31,604 --> 00:02:34,139
Seriously, though, thanks-

45
00:02:34,173 --> 00:02:36,174
Thanks for listening to me
last night.

46
00:02:36,175 --> 00:02:37,842
Yeah, no problem

47
00:02:37,843 --> 00:02:40,845
You know I'm here for you,
whatever you need. But...

48
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,348
I just-I don't want you
to get the wrong impression.

49
00:02:43,382 --> 00:02:45,550
don't worry
I get it.

50
00:02:45,584 --> 00:02:48,053
You and I are friends.
You love serena.

51
00:02:48,087 --> 00:02:49,587
Although it loos like

52
00:02:49,588 --> 00:02:53,024
Love's a bit of a one-way street
right now. Did she call?

53
00:02:53,059 --> 00:02:54,959
She's mad, but she'll cool off.

54
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,861
Morning, sunshines.
Hey, uh...

55
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:58,396
Jenny's on her way out,
actually.

56
00:02:58,397 --> 00:03:01,399
She just crashed the night.

57
00:03:01,434 --> 00:03:04,102
Ah, save it. I know
nothing untoward happened.

58
00:03:04,136 --> 00:03:07,839
Tat was clear by the sound
of you snoring at 2:00 a.M.

59
00:03:07,873 --> 00:03:09,773
And "new moon"
on the pay-per-view bill.

60
00:03:09,775 --> 00:03:12,110
Although I was hoping
to catch you two

61
00:03:12,144 --> 00:03:15,580
In the midst of something more
than a heart-to-heart.

62
00:03:15,614 --> 00:03:17,882
Okay, I'm gonna
go get dressed.

63
00:03:23,289 --> 00:03:27,058
Be careful, nathaniel.
You and serena are on thince.

64
00:03:27,093 --> 00:03:29,394
All it taes is someone to
tap their foot and that cracks.

65
00:03:29,428 --> 00:03:31,396
Oh, what do you know
about relationships?

66
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:33,565
A lo in fact,
I'm about to save mine.

67
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,334
I suggest you do the same
if you can.

68
00:03:37,703 --> 00:03:41,673
I'm sorry.
I- I cannot reach table.

69
00:03:41,707 --> 00:03:44,476
Just this once, dorota.

70
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:46,678
But if that baby
does not arrive soon...

71
00:03:46,712 --> 00:03:49,180
We're going to have to look
into getting you help.

72
00:03:49,215 --> 00:03:52,650
Believe me, I want this baby
to come out as much as you do.

73
00:03:52,685 --> 00:03:54,686
Now as soo
as that moment comes,

74
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,689
Your mother and I are heading
straight back to paris.

75
00:03:57,723 --> 00:04:01,226
So are you coming with us?
What are your plans? Nothing,

76
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,194
Beyond having a secon date
with cameron this afternoon

77
00:04:03,229 --> 00:04:05,230
D staying as far away
as possible

78
00:04:05,264 --> 00:04:08,700
From the empire state building. What's the
empire state building have to do with anything?

79
00:04:08,734 --> 00:04:11,369
"an affair to remember"
was on tcm last night.

80
00:04:11,403 --> 00:04:13,404
It gave me nightmares.

81
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,406
Blair loves
the empire state building,

82
00:04:15,441 --> 00:04:18,076
Even though she doesn't want to,
and she should just admit I

83
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:20,245
And make all our life easier.

84
00:04:20,246 --> 00:04:21,746
Miss blair loves othing

85
00:04:21,747 --> 00:04:24,415
Except for shoes, clothes
and anything harry winston.

86
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:27,018
Now, dorota, would you please
gt me some steamed milk?

87
00:04:27,052 --> 00:04:29,020
'cause this is ice cold.

88
00:04:29,054 --> 00:04:31,856
Actually, no.
I will help you.

89
00:04:33,893 --> 00:04:36,828
Since it appears
you have taken an interest

90
00:04:36,862 --> 00:04:40,131
In the deadline
a certain bass-hat set for me,

91
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:42,133
I'm calling you into service.

92
00:04:42,168 --> 00:04:44,235
But I already
ironed your sheets

93
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:46,504
And alphabetized shoes
by designer, like you ask.

94
00:04:46,539 --> 00:04:48,506
What more is there to do?

95
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:50,742
I'm ordering you to chaperone
my date with cameron.

96
00:04:50,776 --> 00:04:53,378
I need to make sure
that no matter what happens,

97
00:04:53,412 --> 00:04:56,214
I don't go anywhere near
that stupid art deco landmark.

98
00:04:56,248 --> 00:05:01,186
Miss blair, I defrind mr. Chuck
in facebook and in life.

99
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:04,656
But... This is pretty romantic
thing he's doing.

100
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:08,793
If not going means never having
chuck in your life again,

101
00:05:08,827 --> 00:05:11,296
Are you prepared
to live like that?

102
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:14,299
Yes. But even if I'm not,

103
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:17,101
If you let me go
anywhere near 34th street,

104
00:05:17,136 --> 00:05:19,437
There won't be a miracle
but a massacre.

105
00:05:19,471 --> 00:05:22,040
Now...
put on your walking shoes.

106
00:05:22,074 --> 00:05:23,775
We're going on a date.

107
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:33,718
Georgina sparks?

108
00:05:35,254 --> 00:05:36,921
Is that you?

109
00:05:36,922 --> 00:05:40,291
Da. Nice hotel, by the way...
For the upper west side.

110
00:05:40,326 --> 00:05:42,660
I hope you're not here
to hurt me.

111
00:05:42,695 --> 00:05:45,496
"operation ditc the bitch
in belarus" was blair's idea.

112
00:05:45,531 --> 00:05:48,066
I don't want revenge.

113
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:52,604
I need help. I'm scared. Even if
I believed you, I wouldn't care.

114
00:05:52,638 --> 00:05:54,739
This isn't like
the other times, chuck.

115
00:05:54,773 --> 00:05:57,008
The russians
don't mess around.

116
00:05:57,042 --> 00:05:59,344
It's really cold there,
and there's, like,

117
00:05:59,378 --> 00:06:01,679
Barely any designer jeans,
and the average citizen

118
00:06:01,714 --> 00:06:03,915
Drinks about 3nts
of pure alcohol a year.

119
00:06:03,949 --> 00:06:07,318
Unless a one-way ticket
on the "siberian express"

120
00:06:07,353 --> 00:06:08,886
Is what you're looking for,
I'm out.

121
00:06:08,887 --> 00:06:11,456
So if you wouldn't mind, I have
some business to attend to.

122
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:13,791
Maybe I could just wait here
until you get back?

123
00:06:13,826 --> 00:06:18,563
Or I could see you out now.
It's either me or security.

124
00:07:11,483 --> 00:07:13,451
What time is it?

125
00:07:13,485 --> 00:07:16,454
uh, it's later than either of us
wants it to be.

126
00:07:16,488 --> 00:07:18,690
by that, I mean morning.

127
00:07:18,724 --> 00:07:21,225
Oh, my god.

128
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:23,728
Wow. That's not usually
the reaction I hope for

129
00:07:23,762 --> 00:07:27,231
When waking up next to a woman.
It's not that and you know it.

130
00:07:27,266 --> 00:07:28,766
oh!

131
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:31,502
Last night-
don't even finish those words,

132
00:07:31,537 --> 00:07:33,504
Unless-unless they end
with "was a mistake."

133
00:07:33,539 --> 00:07:35,039
I mean, right?

134
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,275
Right. Right.
My thoughts exactly.

135
00:07:37,309 --> 00:07:40,011
I mean, we're...
We're both in relationships.

136
00:07:40,045 --> 00:07:43,214
Yeah. Yeah, it was-
it was totally meaningless.

137
00:07:43,248 --> 00:07:46,784
I mean, we just fell asleep. Yeah,
after an entire bottle of wine

138
00:07:46,819 --> 00:07:49,120
And-and a whole lot
of talking.

139
00:07:49,154 --> 00:07:51,289
And one kiss.

140
00:07:51,323 --> 00:07:52,990
Did that even happen?

141
00:07:52,991 --> 00:07:55,693
I'm not sure-I'm not sure
that happened.

142
00:07:55,728 --> 00:07:57,829
You know, all I remember is-
is you falling sleep on my arm,

143
00:07:57,863 --> 00:07:59,831
And then my not being able
to move it.

144
00:07:59,865 --> 00:08:02,567
In fact, I don't even know if
I still can. Like...

145
00:08:02,601 --> 00:08:05,069
I- I was just upset,
and you were there for me.

146
00:08:05,104 --> 00:08:07,071
It was just
a couple of old friends

147
00:08:07,106 --> 00:08:09,073
Falling into a comfortable
pattern for a minute... Or ten.

148
00:08:09,108 --> 00:08:11,709
And I love nate.
I love vanessa.

149
00:08:11,744 --> 00:08:15,046
W- do we have to tell anyone?
Not on your life. No.

150
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,482
I mean, there's no reason
to explode our whole world

151
00:08:17,516 --> 00:08:21,052
Just for some... Meaningless
kiss between old friends.

152
00:08:21,086 --> 00:08:23,488
Whatever this was,
it's just between us. So...

153
00:08:23,522 --> 00:08:25,656
It's not like we can't
keep that safe.

154
00:08:25,691 --> 00:08:29,327
Yeah.
Call me if you need anything.

155
00:08:29,361 --> 00:08:32,029
Okay. All right. Bye.
Bye.

156
00:08:32,064 --> 00:08:33,765
That was a mistake.
It was completely random.

157
00:08:33,766 --> 00:08:35,666
It was gravity.
Okay. Bye.

158
00:08:35,667 --> 00:08:38,002
You were going for the hug.
I- I went for the...

159
00:08:38,036 --> 00:08:41,305
âª all dressed up wâª

160
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:48,446
Spotted-a family reunion only
faulkner would approve of.

161
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,816
âª all dressed up
with nowhere to go âª

162
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:54,318
I used to think
that s. And lonely boy

163
00:08:54,353 --> 00:08:57,088
Were the most boring couple
on the upper east side.

164
00:08:57,122 --> 00:09:00,858
But what makes them
actually great together?

165
00:09:03,896 --> 00:09:07,231
Is when they're supposed to be
with other people.

166
00:09:33,992 --> 00:09:36,527
76th and 5th, please.

167
00:09:38,797 --> 00:09:41,732
Actuallyke that
the empire hotel, and quick.

168
00:09:43,569 --> 00:09:46,571
Good luck talking your way
out of this one, s.

169
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:58,174
I hope you're on your way
to see nate.

170
00:09:58,208 --> 00:10:01,277
You saw the blast? Yes, and
although I'm inclined to say

171
00:10:01,311 --> 00:10:03,279
That gossip girl doesn't know
what she's talking about,

172
00:10:03,313 --> 00:10:06,282
Since she also posted
some blurry photo

173
00:10:06,316 --> 00:10:07,550
Of a russian mail-order bride
and said it was georgina,

174
00:10:07,551 --> 00:10:09,652
That really did look like
you and humphrey.

175
00:10:09,687 --> 00:10:11,654
I mean,
isn't that a little '08,

176
00:10:11,689 --> 00:10:14,190
Like maxi dresses and
miley cyrus? Blair.

177
00:10:14,224 --> 00:10:17,193
We all try on old clothes
from time to time,

178
00:10:17,227 --> 00:10:19,195
And sur, we may even be
surprised when they still fit,

179
00:10:19,229 --> 00:10:21,330
But that doesn't mean we should
wear them again, ever.

180
00:10:21,365 --> 00:10:24,033
Nothing happened
and as for the photo,

181
00:10:24,068 --> 00:10:26,636
It was obviously the work
of jenny humphrey.

182
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:28,638
I knew she hated me,

183
00:10:28,672 --> 00:10:31,007
But apparently
she hates dan, too.

184
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:33,009
I just wish she would
hole up in brooklyn

185
00:10:33,043 --> 00:10:35,878
And leave the rest of us alone.
Brooklyn. Is that where she is right now?

186
00:10:35,913 --> 00:10:37,880
I guess so.
Look, I-I gotta go call dan

187
00:10:37,915 --> 00:10:40,483
And make sure he knows
what's going on.

188
00:10:40,517 --> 00:10:42,919
Bye.

189
00:10:47,491 --> 00:10:50,293
We have to
get off this island.

190
00:10:50,327 --> 00:10:54,864
Cameron, would you mind
if we made a little detour?

191
00:10:54,898 --> 00:10:56,798
How little?

192
00:11:01,238 --> 00:11:02,538
hey.

193
00:11:02,539 --> 00:11:04,373
So now that our morning

194
00:11:04,374 --> 00:11:07,076
Seems to have made t all over
manhattan... Yeah, I saw that.

195
00:11:07,111 --> 00:11:09,345
I just wanna make sure
we're still on the same page.

196
00:11:09,379 --> 00:11:10,713
Uh, absolutely.

197
00:11:10,714 --> 00:11:12,682
I don't wanna jeopardze
my friendship with nate

198
00:11:12,716 --> 00:11:14,684
Or my relationship
with vanessa

199
00:11:14,718 --> 00:11:16,686
Just as much as you don't want
to jeopardize

200
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,088
Your relationship with nate
or your friendship with vanessa.

201
00:11:19,123 --> 00:11:21,090
Are you friends with vanessa?
Friendly enough

202
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:23,926
To not want her to get upset
over a meaningless kiss.

203
00:11:23,961 --> 00:11:25,928
I mean, it was meaningless,
right? dan, is that you?

204
00:11:25,963 --> 00:11:27,997
Uh, you know, I gotta go.
Good luck.

205
00:11:28,031 --> 00:11:31,200
Hey, was that my lincoln hawk
t- shirt serena was wearing?

206
00:11:31,235 --> 00:11:32,902
You saw "gossip girl"?

207
00:11:32,903 --> 00:11:35,171
I just kinda glanced
over eric's shoulder.

208
00:11:35,205 --> 00:11:37,173
Have you seen jenny?
I need to find her.

209
00:11:37,207 --> 00:11:40,676
I need to talk to her about why she took
that picture. I thought she was with you.

210
00:11:40,711 --> 00:11:43,045
No, she-she wasn't there when
I wok up and she wasn't there

211
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,381
When I went to sleep either,
which wasn't until, like, 4:00.

212
00:11:45,415 --> 00:11:47,583
I wish I didn't have to
say this, dad,

213
00:11:47,618 --> 00:11:49,118
But she's out of control.

214
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:51,921
I mean, yesterday,
it was your marriage,

215
00:11:51,955 --> 00:11:54,223
And today it's nate and serena,
vanessa and me.

216
00:11:54,258 --> 00:11:57,727
She-she's gotta be stopped.
We should go wait for her.

217
00:11:57,761 --> 00:12:00,296
She's bound to show up there
sooner than here.

218
00:12:09,006 --> 00:12:12,575
Hey, have you seen nate?
I have no idea where he is,

219
00:12:12,609 --> 00:12:15,311
Though I do have a good idea
where you've been.

220
00:12:15,345 --> 00:12:18,815
Chuck... Look, before you go and
use whatever line youve prepared,

221
00:12:18,849 --> 00:12:20,016
Think hrd.

222
00:12:20,017 --> 00:12:22,285
Nate knows who he loves
and what he wants.

223
00:12:22,319 --> 00:12:24,520
So unless you can
say the same,

224
00:12:24,555 --> 00:12:27,657
Look him in the eye and tll him
that or stop playing games.

225
00:12:29,993 --> 00:12:31,527
Courage, ma soeur.

226
00:12:31,528 --> 00:12:34,063
Please.

227
00:12:34,097 --> 00:12:35,997
Hey.

228
00:12:35,999 --> 00:12:38,835
Hi.

229
00:12:38,869 --> 00:12:41,938
I mean, I wish I could say
I was happy to see you.

230
00:12:41,972 --> 00:12:44,707
Nothg happened with dan.
We just fell asleep talking.

231
00:12:44,741 --> 00:12:47,109
Oh, really? Nate, you
and I both screwed up.

232
00:12:47,144 --> 00:12:49,979
I only turned to dan
because I was mad at you

233
00:12:50,013 --> 00:12:52,114
For calling the cops
on my father.

234
00:12:52,149 --> 00:12:54,951
And what your dad did
was really wrong, serena.

235
00:12:54,985 --> 00:12:58,321
That was not
for you to decide.

236
00:12:58,355 --> 00:13:00,189
Nate...

237
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:01,858
I love you.

238
00:13:01,859 --> 00:13:04,894
I just wanna
make things work again.

239
00:13:04,928 --> 00:13:07,897
Nothing happened?

240
00:13:09,766 --> 00:13:11,167
Nothing happened.

241
00:13:11,168 --> 00:13:14,837
I just wanna go back
to being us.

242
00:13:14,872 --> 00:13:19,308
I know that it'll be hard,
but I do wanna try.

243
00:13:27,784 --> 00:13:31,287
Blair.
What are you doing here?

244
00:13:31,321 --> 00:13:33,289
Someone has to give you
the smackdown

245
00:13:33,323 --> 00:13:35,458
You so richly deserve.

246
00:13:35,492 --> 00:13:38,494
That's it me who gets to do it
is just the cherry on top.

247
00:13:38,528 --> 00:13:40,396
Bring it on.

248
00:13:40,397 --> 00:13:44,533
I knew when I sent the blast
there'd be fallout.

249
00:13:44,568 --> 00:13:46,636
When are you gonna get it?

250
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:49,672
For three years, you've tried to
worm your way into our world,

251
00:13:49,706 --> 00:13:52,008
But you will never be
a part of it

252
00:13:52,042 --> 00:13:54,010
No matter what you do.

253
00:13:54,044 --> 00:13:56,312
This isn't copycat dressing
at constance

254
00:13:56,346 --> 00:13:59,315
Or dumping dairy on you
best friend to prove a point.

255
00:13:59,349 --> 00:14:02,285
Nate and serena?
That's mythic.

256
00:14:02,319 --> 00:14:05,721
You don't mess with that
and survive.

257
00:14:05,756 --> 00:14:08,758
You're hurting people I love.
You're hurting people you love.

258
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,861
I wasn't trying to-

259
00:14:11,862 --> 00:14:13,796
Nate loves serena,

260
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:15,798
Dan loves vanessa-
god knows why-

261
00:14:15,832 --> 00:14:17,333
And chuck loves me.

262
00:14:17,334 --> 00:14:19,201
But, you, jenny?

263
00:14:19,202 --> 00:14:22,305
No one loves you,
except your daddy.

264
00:14:22,339 --> 00:14:24,473
And after what you pulled
yesterday,

265
00:14:24,508 --> 00:14:26,676
Who knows
if that's even true anymore?

266
00:14:30,047 --> 00:14:32,214
Well...

267
00:14:32,249 --> 00:14:34,583
I guess you'll find out now.

268
00:14:38,455 --> 00:14:41,257
that's so beautiful. I can't
believe it. Are you okay?

269
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:43,893
the miracle of life
growing inside of you.

270
00:14:43,927 --> 00:14:45,895
I'm in luck! Two smackdowns
for the price of none.

271
00:14:45,929 --> 00:14:49,031
What the hell are you doing?
Don't screw up nate and serena.

272
00:14:49,066 --> 00:14:51,567
Nothing happened.
So said serena,

273
00:14:51,601 --> 00:14:54,437
But I'm thinking she left
a little something out.

274
00:14:54,471 --> 00:14:56,372
All right.

275
00:14:56,406 --> 00:14:59,675
Blair...

276
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:02,611
Say life is givng you signs,
and you're ignoring them because

277
00:15:02,646 --> 00:15:04,914
You're afraid of the thing
they're signaling you to do.

278
00:15:04,948 --> 00:15:06,916
But-but then-
but then you think,

279
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:09,452
What if these signs
are here for a reason

280
00:15:09,486 --> 00:15:12,455
And-and ignoring them just makes me
a coward? Sgns are for the religious,

281
00:15:12,489 --> 00:15:14,523
The superstitious
and the lower class.

282
00:15:14,558 --> 00:15:17,426
I don't believe in them
and neither should you.

283
00:15:20,797 --> 00:15:22,498
Damn you, chuck bass.

284
00:15:22,499 --> 00:15:24,066
Damn you to hell.

285
00:15:24,067 --> 00:15:27,503
Why-when did we start talking
about chuck bass?

286
00:15:27,537 --> 00:15:29,872
Spotted atop the empire...

287
00:15:29,906 --> 00:15:31,806
State building, that is-

288
00:15:31,808 --> 00:15:36,212
A boy bllionaire,
flowers in hand.

289
00:15:36,246 --> 00:15:38,047
Oh, chuck.

290
00:15:38,048 --> 00:15:40,016
If you could only see
to brooklyn,

291
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:42,685
You might turn that frown
upside down.

292
00:15:42,719 --> 00:15:45,688
Okay, dorota.
we got a deadline to make.

293
00:15:47,457 --> 00:15:48,924
Uh... Ooh.

294
00:15:48,925 --> 00:15:50,826
My water re.

295
00:15:50,861 --> 00:15:53,195
Oh, my god. Holy... O-okay. All
right, slowly. Slowly. Slowly.

296
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:55,197
Come on. This way.
A little faster.

297
00:15:55,232 --> 00:15:57,833
Then again, maybe you
should guard your heart. Ahh.

298
00:15:57,868 --> 00:16:00,436
Lennox hilspital
right now.

299
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:02,838
Dorota's water might not be

300
00:16:02,873 --> 00:16:04,807
The only thing breaking
tonight.

301
00:16:09,792 --> 00:16:12,059
I spoke to your mother
this morning,

302
00:16:12,094 --> 00:16:17,064
And we decided that you should
spend the summer in hudson

303
00:16:17,099 --> 00:16:19,600
And finish high school
there next year. What?

304
00:16:19,635 --> 00:16:21,302
I thought you'd be happy.

305
00:16:21,303 --> 00:16:23,571
It's a fresh start-
somewhere wthout mean girls

306
00:16:23,605 --> 00:16:26,040
And drug dealing boyfriends
and "gossip girl."

307
00:16:26,074 --> 00:16:29,410
Dad...

308
00:16:29,445 --> 00:16:31,412
The city's all I have.

309
00:16:31,447 --> 00:16:34,449
If I leave,
I have nothing.

310
00:16:34,483 --> 00:16:37,084
I'm sorry.
That's the way it's gonna be.

311
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:38,453
It's done.

312
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,602
Dorota!
Dorota, did I miss it?

313
00:16:54,636 --> 00:16:56,103
Of course not.

314
00:16:58,841 --> 00:17:01,342
Now, you know,
you have at your service

315
00:17:01,376 --> 00:17:04,679
One of the best lamaze coaches
in the world.

316
00:17:04,713 --> 00:17:06,981
I've been present at the labor
of many of my clients.

317
00:17:07,015 --> 00:17:09,283
One of them didn't even know
she was pregnant. Hello, dear.

318
00:17:09,318 --> 00:17:11,552
Hi.
You must go now, miss blair.

319
00:17:11,587 --> 00:17:14,355
If-if you don't arrive before
7:00, he will be gone forever.

320
00:17:14,389 --> 00:17:16,724
No, I-I can't leave you.

321
00:17:16,758 --> 00:17:20,962
I have plenty help. Please.
You have my blessing.

322
00:17:20,996 --> 00:17:23,197
We both get what we want now.

323
00:17:23,232 --> 00:17:25,700
Go.

324
00:17:25,734 --> 00:17:27,602
Okay. I'll be back.

325
00:17:27,603 --> 00:17:29,704
W- where's she going?
What's that about?

326
00:17:29,738 --> 00:17:32,540
Aah!
Hey, nate's getting-

327
00:17:32,574 --> 00:17:36,010
I'm sorry! I can't talk! I have
to go! I hope I'm not too late!

328
00:17:36,078 --> 00:17:38,312
âª

329
00:17:38,347 --> 00:17:39,480
Hey.
Hey.

330
00:17:39,481 --> 00:17:42,283
I've been feelinguilty
all day.

331
00:17:42,317 --> 00:17:44,285
Yeah, I-I know.
I got your text.

332
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:46,354
Um, I'm not sure riht now
is the right time to tell nate.

333
00:17:46,388 --> 00:17:48,823
I mean, there are babies being
born and-and watr is breaking,

334
00:17:48,857 --> 00:17:51,058
And I don't even know what
we would say to him anyway.

335
00:17:51,093 --> 00:17:53,294
U, you don't have to
say anything.

336
00:17:53,328 --> 00:17:55,029
I think I already know.

337
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:56,531
(eastern conference champions'

338
00:17:56,532 --> 00:17:58,499
"don't think twice,
it's all right" playing)

339
00:17:58,534 --> 00:18:00,735
Blair. Stop.

340
00:18:00,769 --> 00:18:02,669
Georgina?

341
00:18:03,405 --> 00:18:05,239
Where are you doing here?

342
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:08,876
I followed your mom and cyrus
from your apartment.

343
00:18:08,911 --> 00:18:11,879
I need to talk to you.
I'm in trouble. Big trouble.

344
00:18:11,914 --> 00:18:14,982
And while it warms my heart
hearing that, I'm late.

345
00:18:15,017 --> 00:18:18,719
Good-bye, georgina.
May god save your soul... Again.

346
00:18:18,754 --> 00:18:20,588
No, a kiss is not nothing.

347
00:18:20,589 --> 00:18:23,057
People don't just kiss
because they're upset.

348
00:18:23,091 --> 00:18:25,560
People kiss because they have
feelings for each other.

349
00:18:25,594 --> 00:18:28,362
So do you?

350
00:18:28,397 --> 00:18:30,197
Nate, that's ridiculous.

351
00:18:30,198 --> 00:18:34,168
I'm with you, and-and he's with vanessa.
Oh, yeah, what about vanessa, huh?

352
00:18:34,202 --> 00:18:36,571
I mean. I seriously doubt she's
reading "gossip girl" in haiti.

353
00:18:36,605 --> 00:18:38,573
But just in case she is,
or even if she's not,

354
00:18:38,607 --> 00:18:40,575
Maybe you should give her
a call, bring her up to speed.

355
00:18:40,609 --> 00:18:43,244
Don't threaten him. Serena,
please. I can stand up for myself.

356
00:18:43,278 --> 00:18:47,615
Really? Because you're being awfully quiet
right now. Yeah, it's because he knows I'm right.

357
00:18:47,649 --> 00:18:50,718
It's time!
The baby is coming!

358
00:18:54,189 --> 00:18:58,225
âª when your rooster crows
at the break of dawn âª

359
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:00,695
Come on, dorota! Push!

360
00:19:00,729 --> 00:19:03,130
âª look out your window
and I'll be gone âª

361
00:19:03,165 --> 00:19:05,399
Not enough! Not enough!

362
00:19:05,434 --> 00:19:08,035
âª you're the reason
I'm traveling on âª

363
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:10,738
âª but don't think twice âª

364
00:19:10,772 --> 00:19:14,041
âª it's all right âª

365
00:19:21,483 --> 00:19:26,921
âª and it ain't no use
in turnin' on your light, babe âª

366
00:19:26,955 --> 00:19:31,726
âª I'm on the dark side
of the road âª

367
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:36,897
âª still, I wish there was
something you would do or say âª

368
00:19:38,567 --> 00:19:40,234
Oh!

369
00:19:40,235 --> 00:19:41,769
oh!

370
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:43,270
It's a girl!

371
00:19:43,271 --> 00:19:44,672
She's beautiful.

372
00:19:46,174 --> 00:19:47,508
âª...Talkin' anyway âª

373
00:19:47,509 --> 00:19:51,479
âª but don't think twice,
it's all right âª

374
00:20:00,355 --> 00:20:02,390
Hi. I'm meeting
a young man here-

375
00:20:02,424 --> 00:20:06,293
Probably in a bow tie,
possibly carrying peonies.

376
00:20:06,328 --> 00:20:09,664
âª I can't hear you anymore âª

377
00:20:09,698 --> 00:20:12,333
âª I'm a5thinkin'
and a-wonderin' âª

378
00:20:12,367 --> 00:20:15,636
âª walking down the road âª

379
00:20:15,671 --> 00:20:20,007
âª I once loved a woman-
a child, I'm told âª

380
00:20:20,042 --> 00:20:23,911
âª I gave her my heart
but she wanted my soul âª

381
00:20:23,945 --> 00:20:25,179
Nate?

382
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:27,314
âª but don't think twice âª

383
00:20:27,349 --> 00:20:29,517
âª it's all right âª

384
00:20:33,555 --> 00:20:36,357
Chuck, what are you doing?

385
00:20:36,391 --> 00:20:38,793
Trying to forget.

386
00:20:38,827 --> 00:20:41,696
I did the most romantic thing
I could think of,

387
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:43,631
And it didn't work.

388
00:20:43,665 --> 00:20:47,301
It was never going to.

389
00:20:47,335 --> 00:20:49,670
I'm sorry.

390
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:53,440
Well, um,

391
00:20:53,442 --> 00:20:56,077
I guess if nate's not here,
I'll go.

392
00:20:57,846 --> 00:21:00,081
Not that I really have
anywhere to go.

393
00:21:00,115 --> 00:21:02,683
You can stay here
if you want.

394
00:21:02,718 --> 00:21:05,186
It's not like you haven't
done it before.

395
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:07,688
Well, yea, but that was
always with nate,

396
00:21:07,723 --> 00:21:11,325
Playing video games
o watching movies or whatever.

397
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:14,328
Well, I don't play video games,
so if you wanna hang with me,

398
00:21:14,362 --> 00:21:16,263
You do what I do.

399
00:21:23,472 --> 00:21:25,773
I'm trying to forget
some things, too.

400
00:21:27,209 --> 00:21:29,176
Mostly how happy
I thought I'd be

401
00:21:29,211 --> 00:21:31,178
Once I made it
in this world.

402
00:21:33,982 --> 00:21:38,586
The world you're looking for
only exists from the outside.

403
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:42,356
The only reason
I survive in it...

404
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:45,092
Is because I always knew
it was empty.

405
00:21:46,928 --> 00:21:50,498
Yeah. And now I know, too.

406
00:21:50,532 --> 00:21:53,501
I found out the hard way.

407
00:21:53,535 --> 00:21:56,303
The hard way

408
00:21:56,338 --> 00:21:58,239
Is the only way.

409
00:22:19,447 --> 00:22:21,415
If you want to leave,

410
00:22:21,449 --> 00:22:23,850
Now would be the time.

411
00:22:25,887 --> 00:22:27,854
I don't want to be alone.

412
00:22:31,159 --> 00:22:33,126
Neither do I.

413
00:22:51,646 --> 00:22:54,414
I didn't expect to find you here
staring at babies.

414
00:22:54,449 --> 00:22:57,284
Turns out I'm a big fan
of babies.

415
00:22:57,318 --> 00:22:59,719
Everything for them
is-is so simple.

416
00:22:59,754 --> 00:23:01,955
They start out
with a clean slate.

417
00:23:01,989 --> 00:23:03,957
They have no idea
how complicated

418
00:23:03,991 --> 00:23:06,159
Everything is gonna
get for them. Yeah.

419
00:23:06,194 --> 00:23:07,928
That baby right there-

420
00:23:07,929 --> 00:23:10,964
He's gonna grow up to be smarter
than the rest of 'em,

421
00:23:10,998 --> 00:23:13,834
Which will make him
feel like an outsider,

422
00:23:13,868 --> 00:23:16,269
Give im a bit of a chip on
his shoulder. Oh, really?

423
00:23:16,304 --> 00:23:18,338
Well, uh, you-you see
that baby there?

424
00:23:18,372 --> 00:23:20,574
She's gonna grow up
to have fabulous hair

425
00:23:20,608 --> 00:23:23,076
And a great smile,
but her daddy issues

426
00:23:23,111 --> 00:23:26,079
Are gonna make it real hard
for her to trust people.

427
00:23:28,116 --> 00:23:30,584
Wanna take a walk?

428
00:23:30,618 --> 00:23:33,186
Yeah.

429
00:23:44,699 --> 00:23:46,666
And this baby's
gonna do some things

430
00:23:46,701 --> 00:23:49,302
To make all the other babies
hate her.

431
00:23:51,372 --> 00:23:54,975
Anastasia.
It's a beautiful name.

432
00:23:55,009 --> 00:23:56,977
Can I hold her?
I know-I know it's soon,

433
00:23:57,011 --> 00:23:59,813
But she's so pink and perfect,
and, oh...

434
00:23:59,847 --> 00:24:02,649
who knew babies
could be so astonishing?

435
00:24:02,683 --> 00:24:04,351
Miss eleanor.

436
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:06,252
Oh.

437
00:24:08,122 --> 00:24:09,589
In fact, uh...

438
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:12,159
Yes, dorota and I
were talking...

439
00:24:12,193 --> 00:24:13,560
Miss eleanor,

440
00:24:13,561 --> 00:24:16,129
Mr. Cyrus,

441
00:24:16,164 --> 00:24:18,498
Would you be ana's godparents?

442
00:24:18,533 --> 00:24:20,700
Would we?

443
00:24:20,735 --> 00:24:23,670
Paris, schmaris.

444
00:24:23,704 --> 00:24:26,206
I am never letting go

445
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,709
Of this precious creature.

446
00:24:29,744 --> 00:24:31,711
Ah!

447
00:24:31,746 --> 00:24:33,747
I feel terrible about nate.

448
00:24:33,748 --> 00:24:37,184
Oh, god, I know.
I know-which part, exactl

449
00:24:37,218 --> 00:24:40,187
Was it the kissing me part
or the him finding out part?

450
00:24:40,221 --> 00:24:42,189
Or wait, was it the part

451
00:24:42,223 --> 00:24:44,191
Where he asked us if we had
feelings for one another?

452
00:24:44,225 --> 00:24:48,161
All of the above. I need to tell vanessa. She
- she's gotta hear this from me.

453
00:24:48,196 --> 00:24:50,897
You guys really are happy,
aren't you?

454
00:24:50,932 --> 00:24:53,500
Yeah, we, uh,
yeah, we are, definitely.

455
00:24:53,534 --> 00:24:55,802
But I-you know, I can't lie.

456
00:24:55,836 --> 00:24:57,804
Knowing someone so well,
you think it's gonna be esier.

457
00:24:57,838 --> 00:24:59,873
But in a lo of ways, it just-
it makes it harder.

458
00:24:59,907 --> 00:25:01,875
Maybe ignorance
really is bliss.

459
00:25:01,909 --> 00:25:04,377
Hmm. Is that why
it was so easy with us?

460
00:25:04,412 --> 00:25:07,847
You mean because?

461
00:25:07,882 --> 00:25:09,916
Yeah. Sure.

462
00:25:09,951 --> 00:25:12,686
Everything is a discovery-

463
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:17,357
This unknown person
who can do or think anything.

464
00:25:26,667 --> 00:25:28,935
Well, that was
perfectly timed.

465
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:30,136
Very.

466
00:25:30,137 --> 00:25:32,037
It's vanessa.

467
00:25:32,039 --> 00:25:35,008
Good news is, she does not get
"gossip girl" blasts in haiti,

468
00:25:35,042 --> 00:25:38,378
But she does get nate's texts,
and he sent her that photo.

469
00:25:38,412 --> 00:25:40,312
How could he do that?

470
00:25:40,314 --> 00:25:42,616
How could he not?

471
00:25:49,957 --> 00:25:51,857
Are you okay?

472
00:25:55,296 --> 00:25:57,397
You're welcome
to stay the night.

473
00:25:57,431 --> 00:25:59,866
You're not kicking me out
into the street?

474
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,868
Lucky me.

475
00:26:01,902 --> 00:26:04,638
Hey. Some people
don't get the offer.

476
00:26:08,776 --> 00:26:10,543
Nate?

477
00:26:10,544 --> 00:26:12,812
chuck?

478
00:26:12,847 --> 00:26:14,747
Chuck!

479
00:26:20,021 --> 00:26:22,188
blair.

480
00:26:22,223 --> 00:26:24,190
What are you doing here?

481
00:26:24,225 --> 00:26:26,760
What are you doing? Is there
someone in there? No, nobody.

482
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,201
Excuse my confusion.

483
00:26:35,236 --> 00:26:38,004
I... Didn't expect
to see you tonight...

484
00:26:38,039 --> 00:26:40,440
Or ever again.

485
00:26:45,179 --> 00:26:47,079
You went.

486
00:26:55,056 --> 00:26:56,956
Sorry I was so late.

487
00:26:56,957 --> 00:26:58,858
I- I waited.

488
00:26:58,893 --> 00:27:01,795
Dorota went into labor.
She had her baby.

489
00:27:01,829 --> 00:27:03,963
I wasn't going to show up.

490
00:27:03,998 --> 00:27:06,533
I was resolved not to.

491
00:27:06,567 --> 00:27:09,035
Every bone in my body
tried to slow me.

492
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:11,371
Every voice in my head
screamed, "don't!"

493
00:27:11,405 --> 00:27:13,840
But...
But I didn't listen.

494
00:27:13,874 --> 00:27:16,810
I followed my heart
because I love you.

495
00:27:18,979 --> 00:27:21,514
I can't deny that our path
has been complicated,

496
00:27:21,549 --> 00:27:24,217
But in the end,
love makes everything simple.

497
00:27:41,836 --> 00:27:44,637
Why don't I make you
a drik?

498
00:27:58,853 --> 00:28:02,956
How about some music?
My ipod's in my room.

499
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:04,657
We don't need music.

500
00:28:04,658 --> 00:28:06,559
I want everything
to be perfect.

501
00:28:35,387 --> 00:28:37,355
Jenny.

502
00:28:37,389 --> 00:28:40,358
go away.

503
00:28:40,392 --> 00:28:44,228
No. We may get mad
at ach other sometimes,

504
00:28:44,263 --> 00:28:46,731
But if you're really hurting,
I'm here for you.

505
00:28:46,765 --> 00:28:49,801
You say that now.

506
00:28:49,835 --> 00:28:51,903
But I'll do something
to let you down.

507
00:28:53,839 --> 00:28:56,374
Then you'll turn your back
like everybody else.

508
00:28:56,408 --> 00:28:58,308
My dad.

509
00:28:58,310 --> 00:28:59,610
Dan.

510
00:28:59,611 --> 00:29:01,312
Nate. Serena.

511
00:29:01,313 --> 00:29:03,213
Blair.

512
00:29:04,483 --> 00:29:07,318
Everybody hates me, even...

513
00:29:08,787 --> 00:29:10,121
Even chuck.

514
00:29:10,122 --> 00:29:12,557
Chuck?

515
00:29:12,591 --> 00:29:14,759
What did you do to chuck?

516
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:20,398
it was such a mistake.

517
00:29:20,432 --> 00:29:22,266
Mistake? Chuck?

518
00:29:22,267 --> 00:29:27,371
âª...To call so we wait for âª

519
00:29:28,473 --> 00:29:30,408
âª morning to wak you âª

520
00:29:30,442 --> 00:29:33,744
Jenny, why would you-
why would yo that?

521
00:29:33,779 --> 00:29:35,947
I was sad. He was sad.

522
00:29:35,981 --> 00:29:37,949
I don't-I don't know.

523
00:29:37,983 --> 00:29:40,351
âª and to know me âª
it's not the worst thing.

524
00:29:40,385 --> 00:29:43,354
I mean, it's not worse
than that time with damien-

525
00:29:43,388 --> 00:29:45,289
I didn't do it with damien.

526
00:29:45,324 --> 00:29:46,657
What?

527
00:29:46,658 --> 00:29:49,260
I wanted you to think it.

528
00:29:49,294 --> 00:29:51,996
I didn't, and...

529
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:53,531
I wanted to wait. I...

530
00:29:53,532 --> 00:29:56,167
I wanted it
to be special, and..

531
00:29:57,970 --> 00:30:00,304
âª and I'll be redy âª

532
00:30:00,339 --> 00:30:03,374
Don't touch me.

533
00:30:03,408 --> 00:30:05,308
Don't tell anyone?

534
00:30:07,012 --> 00:30:10,681
âª at every occasion, once more âª

535
00:30:10,716 --> 00:30:12,283
âª it's called the funeral âª

536
00:30:18,223 --> 00:30:22,093
âª at every occasion,
oh, I'm ready âª

537
00:30:22,127 --> 00:30:24,695
âª for the funeral âª

538
00:30:26,565 --> 00:30:28,666
Nate, we need to alk.

539
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:31,802
I was just gonna say
te same thing.

540
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:36,307
Excuse me.

541
00:30:36,308 --> 00:30:37,475
Hey.

542
00:30:37,476 --> 00:30:39,443
Hey. Have you seen
my dad and lily?

543
00:30:39,478 --> 00:30:41,445
They're supposed
to be here with food.

544
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,881
No. No, I haven't seen them,
but, um, jenny's here. Uh...

545
00:30:43,916 --> 00:30:45,883
She needs help. You're just
now realizing this? You-

546
00:30:45,918 --> 00:30:48,352
Dan. Okay.
What-what-what happened?

547
00:30:48,387 --> 00:30:50,955
You need to ask her.
She's in the chapel.

548
00:30:56,161 --> 00:30:58,229
I don't know, I guess I thought
when my dad came back,

549
00:30:58,263 --> 00:31:00,998
That I would start making
different choices

550
00:31:01,033 --> 00:31:04,702
And-an stop making
the same mistakes.

551
00:31:04,736 --> 00:31:06,636
Well,
at least that's honest.

552
00:31:09,608 --> 00:31:12,743
Yeah, I think I need
to be alone for a while.

553
00:31:12,778 --> 00:31:15,846
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait.

554
00:31:15,881 --> 00:31:17,848
I find it in my heart

555
00:31:17,883 --> 00:31:20,551
To forgive you
for kissing another guy,

556
00:31:20,585 --> 00:31:24,422
And you're gonna break up with me? It's not
breaking up. It's-it's just taking a break.

557
00:31:24,456 --> 00:31:27,758
It's not you
- oh, "it's not you. It's me." right?

558
00:31:27,793 --> 00:31:30,594
Yes, serena, it is you.

559
00:31:30,629 --> 00:31:32,563
You know, I think it's great

560
00:31:32,597 --> 00:31:35,066
That you want
to work on yourself,

561
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:38,169
But I'm not gonna wait around
to see how things go.

562
00:31:38,203 --> 00:31:42,073
So if you're out,
you're out.

563
00:31:42,107 --> 00:31:44,675
That's fair.

564
00:31:46,778 --> 00:31:48,612
Nate, I love you.

565
00:31:48,613 --> 00:31:50,147
I really do.

566
00:31:50,148 --> 00:31:52,616
But if we're ever gonna have
a real chance,

567
00:31:52,651 --> 00:31:54,551
This is the only way.

568
00:32:09,534 --> 00:32:12,236
Despite the false start
earlier,

569
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:14,438
This night is perfect.

570
00:32:14,473 --> 00:32:17,908
Well, there is one thingthat wo.

571
00:32:22,347 --> 00:32:26,584
I am so sorry for the pain
I've caused you.

572
00:32:26,618 --> 00:32:29,120
And I know
I can't take it back,

573
00:32:29,154 --> 00:32:31,589
But I wanna try
and make it up to you,

574
00:32:31,623 --> 00:32:33,724
Even if it takes me
the rest of my life.

575
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:36,794
Blair, will you-

576
00:32:36,828 --> 00:32:38,662
humphrey!

577
00:32:38,663 --> 00:32:41,265
Have you lost your mind?!
What the hell are you doing?!

578
00:32:41,299 --> 00:32:44,168
You, tell her.

579
00:32:44,202 --> 00:32:46,670
Tell me what?
What's going on?

580
00:32:59,618 --> 00:33:03,020
You didn'.

581
00:33:03,055 --> 00:33:04,555
Blair.

582
00:33:05,757 --> 00:33:07,657
you did.

583
00:33:10,228 --> 00:33:12,997
You.

584
00:33:13,031 --> 00:33:14,832
Get out of here now.

585
00:33:14,833 --> 00:33:17,935
And not just
out of this hospital,

586
00:33:17,969 --> 00:33:19,637
But off this island.

587
00:33:19,638 --> 00:33:22,373
Go and never come back,

588
00:33:22,407 --> 00:33:27,044
Because if you ever set foot in
manhattan again, I will know...

589
00:33:27,079 --> 00:33:28,679
And I wll destroy you.

590
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,648
blair, I'm sobry.

591
00:33:30,682 --> 00:33:34,085
You have no reason to be sorry.
This begins and ends with chuck.

592
00:33:35,253 --> 00:33:36,520
hey!

593
00:33:36,521 --> 00:33:38,421
Who's hungry?

594
00:33:39,991 --> 00:33:42,693
I got enough bagel chips
to feed an...

595
00:33:42,727 --> 00:33:44,895
What'd I just walk into?

596
00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:47,264
Dad.

597
00:33:48,533 --> 00:33:50,935
Rufus. Hey, come here.
Come here. Let's go st.

598
00:33:55,507 --> 00:33:58,609
Are you okay?

599
00:34:00,879 --> 00:34:04,215
Hey, let me walk you home.

600
00:34:08,053 --> 00:34:10,421
blair, I-

601
00:34:10,455 --> 00:34:12,756
I thought you didn't
love me anymore.

602
00:34:12,791 --> 00:34:15,693
I didn't care
if I lived or died.

603
00:34:15,727 --> 00:34:18,529
Jenny humhrey was ust-
no, don't say her name!

604
00:34:18,563 --> 00:34:21,665
Or anything else to me
ever again.

605
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:24,935
This whole night
didn't happen.

606
00:34:39,781 --> 00:34:42,249
are you sure
you wanna do this?

607
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:44,551
Yeah.
It's my idea this time

608
00:34:45,987 --> 00:34:47,154
Dad!

609
00:34:47,155 --> 00:34:50,057
come here, kiddo.
No tears!

610
00:34:50,091 --> 00:34:53,527
Oh, don't worry. I'm
done crying. I meant me.

611
00:34:53,561 --> 00:34:56,129
I'm gonna miss you so much.

612
00:34:56,164 --> 00:34:58,465
Yeah. Your mother's thrilled
to have you,

613
00:34:58,499 --> 00:35:00,467
But you can come home
anytime.

614
00:35:00,501 --> 00:35:02,903
You are my daughter,
jenny,

615
00:35:02,937 --> 00:35:05,639
And I love you forever
and always, come whatever.

616
00:35:05,673 --> 00:35:07,174
I love you, too.

617
00:35:07,175 --> 00:35:09,543
There's nothing here for me
anymore, though.

618
00:35:11,346 --> 00:35:12,879
I'm here.

619
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,281
Eric.

620
00:35:14,282 --> 00:35:15,782
Please don't go.

621
00:35:15,783 --> 00:35:18,385
You may be a total bitch
sometimes,

622
00:35:18,419 --> 00:35:20,554
But you're still
my best friend.

623
00:35:20,588 --> 00:35:23,390
What am I gonna do next year
at school without you?

624
00:35:23,424 --> 00:35:25,659
Who's gonna dump yogurt
on my head?

625
00:35:26,728 --> 00:35:29,062
I'll skype you every day.

626
00:35:30,932 --> 00:35:32,899
All right, dan, jenny.
Humphrey hug.

627
00:35:32,934 --> 00:35:34,101
Aah!

628
00:35:34,102 --> 00:35:36,436
Eric and lily,
get in here, too.

629
00:35:36,471 --> 00:35:39,206
aah!
All right, I gotta go.

630
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,974
No, no, no. A little longer.
A little longer.

631
00:35:40,975 --> 00:35:43,043
but I love you. Bye, guys.

632
00:35:43,077 --> 00:35:44,978
See you.

633
00:35:57,458 --> 00:36:00,961
I'm actually excited
to have an entire summer

634
00:36:00,995 --> 00:36:03,463
With nothing to do
but figure things out.

635
00:36:03,498 --> 00:36:05,165
Um, first of all, s.,

636
00:36:05,166 --> 00:36:07,134
You didn't go to school
this year

637
00:36:07,168 --> 00:36:09,136
And you haven't
had a real job in months,

638
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:12,739
So life is kind of like summer
for you. Oh, okay. Thanks.

639
00:36:12,774 --> 00:36:16,076
Kick a girl when she's down.
I really am gonna change.

640
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:18,078
Why? All the drama-
it's who you are,

641
00:36:18,112 --> 00:36:21,081
Just like I'm someone who's not
gonna stop looking for love

642
00:36:21,115 --> 00:36:23,083
Just because I've lost it...
Which is why I'm going

643
00:36:23,117 --> 00:36:25,419
Directly into the bell
of the beast-paris-

644
00:36:25,453 --> 00:36:27,421
And why you're coming
with me.

645
00:36:27,455 --> 00:36:29,990
Uh, I was gonna
do a cleanse and yoga.

646
00:36:30,024 --> 00:36:32,626
And maybe keeping
a dream journal.

647
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:35,095
Haven't you heard
of retail therapy?

648
00:36:35,129 --> 00:36:37,931
And everyone goes to paris
to write their memoirs-

649
00:36:37,965 --> 00:36:39,933
Not thatyou'll,

650
00:36:39,967 --> 00:36:42,769
What with all the riding around
on vespas in cute outfits.

651
00:36:42,804 --> 00:36:46,840
We have never been single together...
Or traveled to a foreign land!

652
00:36:46,874 --> 00:36:49,342
La premiÃ¨re on air France
has turndown service,

653
00:36:49,377 --> 00:36:51,611
And the chef has
three michelin stars.

654
00:36:51,646 --> 00:36:54,314
Come on.
Shopping at palais royale,

655
00:36:54,348 --> 00:36:57,584
People watching at cafÃ© de flore?
Oh, lingerie and pierre hermÃ©?

656
00:36:57,618 --> 00:37:01,354
Mm-hmm. Ooh! Thank you! I
really think I need this.

657
00:37:01,389 --> 00:37:02,789
Me, too.

658
00:37:03,891 --> 00:37:06,326
It's gonna be okay, b.

659
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:09,362
As long as we have each other,
we're both gonna be okay.

660
00:37:10,832 --> 00:37:13,133
paris! Aah!

661
00:37:13,167 --> 00:37:16,303
Hey, man,
thanks for calling.

662
00:37:16,337 --> 00:37:19,706
Um... You gonna apologize
or you waiting for me?

663
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:22,776
'cause I don't-I don't mind
going first. No, I'll go.

664
00:37:22,810 --> 00:37:25,479
Look, I'm sorry
for what happened with vanessa.

665
00:37:25,513 --> 00:37:28,181
I mean, you fired a shot at me.
I fired a shot at you.

666
00:37:28,216 --> 00:37:30,183
But it was a dick move.

667
00:37:30,218 --> 00:37:33,186
And I don't blame you for what
happened between me and serena.

668
00:37:33,221 --> 00:37:35,922
Uh, well, thanks,
but I didn't exactly help.

669
00:37:35,957 --> 00:37:39,192
So, uh, I'm sorry for that.

670
00:37:39,227 --> 00:37:42,195
As for vanessa, I mean,
maybe if I told her the truth,

671
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:44,231
That photo wouldn't have
hit her so hard.

672
00:37:44,265 --> 00:37:46,333
That bad, huh?
What'd she say?

673
00:37:46,367 --> 00:37:49,035
Nothing, since she's not
currently returning my calls.

674
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:51,037
But I'm-I'm about
to write her

675
00:37:51,072 --> 00:37:54,374
The world's longest and most plaintive
e- mail. You trying to get her back?

676
00:37:54,408 --> 00:37:57,010
I'm just trying to explain
what happened,

677
00:37:57,044 --> 00:37:59,012
To her and-and to myself,
you know? Let me know

678
00:37:59,046 --> 00:38:01,548
If you wanna take a break
from the little soul searching.

679
00:38:01,582 --> 00:38:03,817
When he took off for prague,

680
00:38:03,851 --> 00:38:05,819
Chuck left me
his little black book.

681
00:38:05,853 --> 00:38:08,522
Oh, I-I didn't realize you
and serena were actually over.

682
00:38:08,556 --> 00:38:10,790
Yeah, well, I'm not gonna
spend the entire summer

683
00:38:10,825 --> 00:38:14,661
Waiting for her to figure things out.
Righ yeah, that, uh, that makes sense.

684
00:38:14,695 --> 00:38:17,130
Listen, I'm gonna have to pass
on the little black book thing.

685
00:38:17,164 --> 00:38:21,001
But, uh, you enjoy yourself. All
right, man? Oh, I'm sure gonna try.

686
00:38:34,181 --> 00:38:36,783
hey, dan. I mean, bonjour!

687
00:38:36,817 --> 00:38:39,519
No, you mean, au revoir.
Good-bye, humphrey!

688
00:38:39,554 --> 00:38:42,422
We're leaving! Is that
blair? Where you guys going?

689
00:38:42,456 --> 00:38:44,190
Paris.
Paris? Oh, wow.

690
00:38:44,191 --> 00:38:47,060
Um... Well, have-have fun.

691
00:38:47,094 --> 00:38:49,162
thank you.
You called me. What's up?

692
00:38:49,196 --> 00:38:50,630
Oh, yeah. Um, you know,

693
00:38:50,631 --> 00:38:52,599
Just calling to talk about-
about things.

694
00:38:52,633 --> 00:38:55,101
Uh, but obviously,
now's not a good time.

695
00:38:55,136 --> 00:38:58,672
So just call me when you get
back. Okay. I'll miss you!

696
00:38:58,706 --> 00:39:01,841
I'll miss you, too, humphrey!
Bon vacance!

697
00:39:01,876 --> 00:39:04,377
I'll see you in September,
okay? Okay, sounds good.

698
00:39:04,412 --> 00:39:06,312
Okay, bye.

699
00:39:08,549 --> 00:39:10,684
No, it doesn't.

700
00:39:20,094 --> 00:39:22,395
Uh, come in! It's open!

701
00:39:24,332 --> 00:39:26,232
Hi, dan.

702
00:39:26,267 --> 00:39:29,069
Georgina, what are you-what are
you doing back in town?

703
00:39:29,103 --> 00:39:31,905
Looking for you, actually.

704
00:39:31,939 --> 00:39:35,075
I, um, I have something
of yours.

705
00:39:35,109 --> 00:39:37,978
What? I don't-I don't remember
giving you anything.

706
00:39:38,012 --> 00:39:40,380
Well...

707
00:39:40,414 --> 00:39:42,082
You gave me this.

708
00:39:42,083 --> 00:39:43,450
What?!

709
00:39:43,451 --> 00:39:46,219
Congratulations, daddy.

710
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:48,154
He looks just like you

711
00:39:48,189 --> 00:39:50,156
âª pressure âª

712
00:39:50,191 --> 00:39:53,693
And all in an instant,
everything changes.

713
00:39:55,997 --> 00:39:57,497
âª under pssure âª

714
00:39:57,498 --> 00:40:01,334
We leave the past behind
and speed toward the unknown-

715
00:40:01,369 --> 00:40:04,237
Our future.

716
00:40:04,271 --> 00:40:08,508
We set out for far-off places
and try to find ourselves...

717
00:40:08,542 --> 00:40:10,677
âª people on the streets âª

718
00:40:12,413 --> 00:40:14,381
âª it's the terror of knowing âª

719
00:40:14,415 --> 00:40:16,549
Or try to lose ourselves

720
00:40:16,584 --> 00:40:20,520
Exploring pleasures
closer to home.

721
00:40:20,554 --> 00:40:23,490
âª pray tomorrow,
gets me higher âª

722
00:40:25,593 --> 00:40:28,895
âª people on the stret âª

723
00:40:31,165 --> 00:40:35,135
The problems start when
we refuse to let change happen

724
00:40:35,169 --> 00:40:38,171
And cling to old habits.

725
00:40:38,205 --> 00:40:40,273
Dekuji, ladies.

726
00:40:40,307 --> 00:40:42,207
A velvet revolution indeed.

727
00:40:50,184 --> 00:40:53,953
Hey. Look, you don't-
you don't need to get rough.

728
00:40:53,988 --> 00:40:57,090
Okay, I've got lots of money.
I'm chuck bass.

729
00:40:57,124 --> 00:40:59,024
Hey. Hey! Hey!

730
00:40:59,026 --> 00:41:01,795
Come on. Come on
not that. Not that.

731
00:41:01,829 --> 00:41:03,863
just let me keep the box.
Take me to a bank.

732
00:41:03,898 --> 00:41:06,433
I will give you the money.

733
00:41:06,467 --> 00:41:08,568
Just let me keep the box!

734
00:41:23,184 --> 00:41:26,820
But if we hold on
to the past too tight,

735
00:41:26,854 --> 00:41:28,888
The future may never come.

736
00:41:35,796 --> 00:41:37,764
Till death do us part.

737
00:41:37,798 --> 00:41:40,934
X.O.X.O., gossip girl.
