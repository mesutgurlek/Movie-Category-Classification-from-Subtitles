1
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:44,189
Was that in 1913 or 17?
I can't remember now.

2
00:01:45,523 --> 00:01:50,236
I'm beginning to forget
all the people that I used to know, see?

3
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,785
Do I remember Louise Bryant?

4
00:01:59,412 --> 00:02:02,790
Why, of course.
I couldn't forget her if I tried.

5
00:02:08,213 --> 00:02:09,589
I can't...

6
00:02:09,714 --> 00:02:13,051
I might sort of scratch my memory,

7
00:02:13,134 --> 00:02:15,053
but not at the moment.

8
00:02:16,054 --> 00:02:19,516
You know, things go
and come back again.

9
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:23,144
It was Christopher Street,

10
00:02:23,728 --> 00:02:26,105
and I was thinking about

11
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,400
another street down there instead,

12
00:02:29,526 --> 00:02:32,946
until it came back
that it was Christopher Street.

13
00:02:33,279 --> 00:02:35,990
Sometimes I have lapses like that.

14
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:40,245
I'd forgotten all about them.

15
00:02:40,411 --> 00:02:42,247
Were they socialists?

16
00:02:43,748 --> 00:02:45,750
I guess they must've been,

17
00:02:45,834 --> 00:02:47,961
but I don't think they were
of any importance.

18
00:02:48,086 --> 00:02:49,796
I don't remember them at all.

19
00:02:50,129 --> 00:02:53,091
I know that Jack went around
with Mabel Dodge,

20
00:02:53,174 --> 00:02:56,594
and then he went around
with another gal,

21
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:59,305
and then he went around
with Louise Bryant.

22
00:03:00,515 --> 00:03:02,934
I know there were shifts back and forth,

23
00:03:03,017 --> 00:03:05,478
but it never occurred to me...

24
00:03:05,979 --> 00:03:09,232
It never impinged on
my own personal life.

25
00:03:09,315 --> 00:03:10,608
I like baseball.

26
00:03:10,733 --> 00:03:13,611
I don't know what
the outside world thought of them.

27
00:03:13,945 --> 00:03:15,655
But they were a couple.

28
00:03:16,322 --> 00:03:19,742
I mean, you always spoke of
Louise Bryant and Jack Reed.

29
00:03:19,826 --> 00:03:23,913
I recall his telling me
that he had two ambitions

30
00:03:24,038 --> 00:03:25,498
when he came to college.

31
00:03:25,623 --> 00:03:28,585
One was to be elected
president of his class.

32
00:03:28,668 --> 00:03:31,462
He didn't know anyone in the class.
No one knew him.

33
00:03:31,588 --> 00:03:34,841
The other was to make a million dollars

34
00:03:35,091 --> 00:03:37,010
by the time he was 25.

35
00:03:37,594 --> 00:03:41,931
Now, my idea about Jack Reed
is probably different from most.

36
00:03:42,015 --> 00:03:46,728
But I knew him well.
I knew he was a man of strong views.

37
00:03:46,811 --> 00:03:48,813
I knew he was independent.

38
00:03:48,897 --> 00:03:51,983
And I have an idea,
I may be wrong of this,

39
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:54,235
that his wife was a Communist

40
00:03:54,736 --> 00:03:58,781
and that his wife had influenced him,
as any wife does,

41
00:03:58,865 --> 00:04:00,450
as you know and I know.

42
00:04:03,203 --> 00:04:04,412
Louise Bryant?

43
00:04:04,495 --> 00:04:08,333
Well, I thought she was something
of an exhibitionist.

44
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:11,753
No, I'm not gonna talk about people.
Don't fool yourself.

45
00:04:12,253 --> 00:04:16,132
No, sir. I'm not... I'm not

46
00:04:16,883 --> 00:04:18,927
a purveyor of neighborhood gossip,
or anything of the kind.

47
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:20,178
That's not my job.

48
00:04:20,637 --> 00:04:22,055
He was quiet.

49
00:04:23,598 --> 00:04:25,600
He was a nice fellow.

50
00:04:26,392 --> 00:04:30,480
I would say, if I met him,
I would say he was a nice fellow.

51
00:04:31,523 --> 00:04:34,901
He was, however, a fighting fellow

52
00:04:35,026 --> 00:04:36,903
in regards to principles.

53
00:04:37,028 --> 00:04:41,366
I said, I think,
that a guy who's always interested

54
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:44,285
in the condition of the world
and changing it

55
00:04:44,369 --> 00:04:46,579
either has no problems of his own

56
00:04:46,788 --> 00:04:48,665
or refuses to face them.

57
00:04:49,082 --> 00:04:52,085
Jack...
Well, I wouldn't call him a playboy,

58
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:53,503
but some people did.

59
00:04:53,586 --> 00:04:57,632
Jack Reed's life, short as it was,

60
00:04:58,341 --> 00:05:00,093
happened at a time,

61
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:03,763
and all of us, after all,
are the victims of our time and place,

62
00:05:04,222 --> 00:05:07,725
when he had the opportunity,
as a reporter,

63
00:05:08,017 --> 00:05:11,229
to be in some very exciting
and dramatic places.

64
00:05:11,479 --> 00:05:15,066
It isn't everybody can
be buried in the Kremlin,

65
00:05:15,942 --> 00:05:18,278
and he's the only American.

66
00:05:18,403 --> 00:05:20,864
Born in Portland, Oregon.

67
00:05:22,073 --> 00:05:24,033
Now, isn't that something?

68
00:05:24,534 --> 00:05:26,578
- What's he hugging?
- A statue.

69
00:05:26,703 --> 00:05:29,372
Well, I can see that.
But what's it a statue of?

70
00:05:29,497 --> 00:05:31,082
It's just a statue, Mr. Woodward.

71
00:05:31,207 --> 00:05:33,501
- How much is it?
- It's $75.

72
00:05:33,585 --> 00:05:35,503
- For a photograph?
- That's right, Mrs. Rudisile.

73
00:05:35,587 --> 00:05:37,172
This is interesting, Mrs. Trullinger.

74
00:05:37,297 --> 00:05:39,883
Not that it isn't very nice,
but it isn't a painting.

75
00:05:40,008 --> 00:05:42,218
Mr. Woodward,
I'd like you to look at this.

76
00:05:42,302 --> 00:05:44,387
- I think I see the intention here.
- Yes.

77
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:46,264
Eve dominates, you see?

78
00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:48,349
The dream dominates the dreamer.

79
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,893
It's...

80
00:05:52,937 --> 00:05:54,731
It looks blurry to me.

81
00:05:54,898 --> 00:05:57,066
The other one looked blurry, too.

82
00:05:57,150 --> 00:06:00,486
I think that's the intention
of the photographer, Mr. Woodward.

83
00:06:00,612 --> 00:06:01,905
What? To be blurry?

84
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:04,115
But perhaps if you looked at it
from a different point of view...

85
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,408
Louise!

86
00:06:06,159 --> 00:06:07,869
This is you?

87
00:06:14,459 --> 00:06:15,752
Lovely figure.

88
00:06:25,136 --> 00:06:26,763
Louise, have you taken
leave of your senses?

89
00:06:26,846 --> 00:06:28,515
Don't be a fool, Paul.

90
00:06:28,723 --> 00:06:30,558
You think I'm a fool
because I object to my wife

91
00:06:30,642 --> 00:06:32,769
being displayed naked in front
of half the people I know...

92
00:06:32,852 --> 00:06:34,687
Yes. My God,
it's a work of art in a gallery.

93
00:06:34,812 --> 00:06:35,855
What's the matter with you?

94
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:38,149
You used to call Portland
a stuffy provincial coffin for the mind.

95
00:06:38,274 --> 00:06:39,234
It may be stuffy and provincial,

96
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:41,402
but it also happens
to be a coffin where I earn a living.

97
00:06:41,486 --> 00:06:43,029
You can take your living
and fill up teeth with it,

98
00:06:43,154 --> 00:06:44,572
because I can earn my own living.

99
00:06:44,656 --> 00:06:45,657
I have my work.

100
00:06:45,782 --> 00:06:49,244
You consider a few articles in
The Oregonian and The Gazette work?

101
00:06:49,327 --> 00:06:50,828
No, I'll tell you
what your work is, Louise.

102
00:06:50,954 --> 00:06:52,956
It's making yourself
the center of attention.

103
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:56,209
It's shocking Louise Trullinger,
emancipated woman of Portland.

104
00:06:56,334 --> 00:06:58,795
Now, we're gonna say good night
to these people and go home.

105
00:06:58,878 --> 00:07:01,172
- I'm going to the Liberal Club.
- You're not going to the Liberal Club.

106
00:07:01,297 --> 00:07:02,966
- I'm going to the Liberal Club, Paul.
- No, you're not...

107
00:07:04,551 --> 00:07:07,428
It's very nice, Mrs. Trullinger. All of it.

108
00:07:07,804 --> 00:07:10,348
It's very gratifying to hear,
isn't it, Louise?

109
00:07:10,473 --> 00:07:11,891
Isn't it, Louise?

110
00:07:15,144 --> 00:07:18,398
Of course, you know
who is going to be at the Liberal Club.

111
00:07:18,606 --> 00:07:21,192
Patriotic Americans believe in freedom.

112
00:07:21,401 --> 00:07:25,113
And unless we are willing to take arms
to defend our heritage,

113
00:07:25,196 --> 00:07:28,533
we cannot call ourselves
patriotic Americans!

114
00:07:30,076 --> 00:07:31,953
I'm proud to be free.

115
00:07:32,203 --> 00:07:34,038
I'm proud to be an American.

116
00:07:34,163 --> 00:07:36,958
And if the man
we elected President decides

117
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:38,835
that our freedoms are being threatened

118
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,921
and that the world must
be made safe for democracy,

119
00:07:42,213 --> 00:07:46,509
then I know I won't be alone
in heeding the call of patriotism!

120
00:07:46,718 --> 00:07:48,845
What is this war about?

121
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,598
Each man will have his own answer.

122
00:07:51,973 --> 00:07:55,393
I have mine. I'm ready to be called!

123
00:08:03,693 --> 00:08:05,862
Now, tonight we have with us

124
00:08:05,945 --> 00:08:09,949
the son of Margaret
and the late C.J. Reed of Portland,

125
00:08:10,074 --> 00:08:12,869
who has witnessed this war first-hand.

126
00:08:12,952 --> 00:08:16,331
And I, for one, see no reason
why we here at the Liberal Club

127
00:08:16,414 --> 00:08:19,209
shouldn't listen to what
Jack Reed has to say.

128
00:08:24,631 --> 00:08:28,510
What would you say
this war is about, Jack Reed?

129
00:08:38,811 --> 00:08:40,021
Profits.

130
00:08:41,731 --> 00:08:43,066
What did he say?

131
00:08:48,112 --> 00:08:50,615
Excuse me, Mr. Reed.
Hello, my name is Louise Bryant

132
00:08:50,698 --> 00:08:51,658
and I am a journalist.

133
00:08:51,783 --> 00:08:54,035
And I was wondering if you might
have time to give me an interview.

134
00:08:54,118 --> 00:08:55,328
I'm sorry, I don't. I don't do interviews.

135
00:08:55,453 --> 00:08:57,872
I had a piece in the Blast not long ago.

136
00:08:58,414 --> 00:09:00,750
- Berkman's Blast? Really?
- That's right.

137
00:09:05,255 --> 00:09:06,840
Well, when did you want
to do this interview?

138
00:09:06,965 --> 00:09:07,924
Now.

139
00:09:08,049 --> 00:09:09,175
I don't live here.

140
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,261
- I live in a house by the river.
- Oh, really.

141
00:09:11,386 --> 00:09:13,179
My, my, my. Two places.

142
00:09:15,515 --> 00:09:18,059
Yeah, I use this place as a studio.

143
00:09:19,394 --> 00:09:21,104
Do you like white lilies?

144
00:09:21,771 --> 00:09:23,565
They're my favorite flowers.

145
00:09:24,607 --> 00:09:28,653
- You're not married, are you?
- No, I don't think I believe in marriage.

146
00:09:28,778 --> 00:09:29,737
- Are you married?
- Marriage?

147
00:09:29,863 --> 00:09:31,364
How could anyone believe in marriage?

148
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:34,742
I bet your mother's glad
to see you back in Portland.

149
00:09:34,826 --> 00:09:37,328
Just glad when I'm not in jail.
Is this you?

150
00:09:37,495 --> 00:09:39,205
Yes. Do you like it?

151
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:42,375
Yeah. I think they're...

152
00:09:43,168 --> 00:09:47,046
- A little blurry, but this one's very nice.
- Yes.

153
00:09:47,172 --> 00:09:48,298
It is. Now...

154
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:52,510
Granted, the profit motive
in the world economy

155
00:09:52,635 --> 00:09:54,596
is a basic root cause for the war.

156
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:56,973
Do you feel that those
Americans who are pro-war

157
00:09:57,098 --> 00:10:00,727
and who ascribe their motives
to patriotism are cynical or naive?

158
00:10:00,852 --> 00:10:03,229
And, if they're cynical,
is it the cynicism of patriots

159
00:10:03,521 --> 00:10:04,981
who feel that without a profit motive,

160
00:10:05,106 --> 00:10:07,817
the power structure elite of this country
will not enter the war,

161
00:10:07,942 --> 00:10:09,360
even though they feel
that the containment

162
00:10:09,444 --> 00:10:11,487
of German militarism
may be necessary for...

163
00:10:11,696 --> 00:10:13,990
All right, Miss Bryant, do you want
an interview? Write this down.

164
00:10:14,073 --> 00:10:15,033
Are you naive enough to think

165
00:10:15,158 --> 00:10:17,493
containing German militarism
has anything to do with this war?

166
00:10:17,577 --> 00:10:20,038
Don't you understand that England
and France own the world economy

167
00:10:20,163 --> 00:10:21,497
and Germany just wants a piece of it?

168
00:10:21,623 --> 00:10:22,665
Keep writing, Miss Bryant.

169
00:10:22,749 --> 00:10:25,001
Miss Bryant, can't you grasp
that J.P. Morgan

170
00:10:25,084 --> 00:10:27,170
has loaned England and France
a billion dollars?

171
00:10:27,253 --> 00:10:29,255
And if Germany wins,
he won't get it back.

172
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:31,007
More coffee?
America would be entering the war

173
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:32,300
to protect J.P. Morgan's money.

174
00:10:32,383 --> 00:10:33,593
If he loses it, we'll have a depression.

175
00:10:33,718 --> 00:10:34,844
So, the real question is,

176
00:10:34,928 --> 00:10:37,013
why do we have an economy
where the poor have to pay

177
00:10:37,096 --> 00:10:38,389
so the rich won't lose money?

178
00:10:38,515 --> 00:10:39,891
All right, now, what haven't we covered?

179
00:10:40,016 --> 00:10:42,560
Economic freedom for women
means sexual freedom,

180
00:10:42,685 --> 00:10:44,521
and sexual freedom
means birth control...

181
00:10:44,604 --> 00:10:46,314
Dissent! The Masses stands for dissent.

182
00:10:46,397 --> 00:10:47,690
...we have a predominantly

183
00:10:47,774 --> 00:10:48,942
upper-middle class readership.

184
00:10:49,067 --> 00:10:51,653
So, we have to run around the country
raising money for the magazine

185
00:10:51,736 --> 00:10:53,112
any way we...

186
00:10:57,158 --> 00:10:58,368
What?

187
00:10:59,702 --> 00:11:02,038
Well, I'm thinking that I guess I...

188
00:11:02,247 --> 00:11:04,415
That I ought to offer you more coffee.

189
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:07,252
I hadn't realized the hour, but

190
00:11:07,669 --> 00:11:10,129
I seem to have taken up
a lot of your time.

191
00:11:10,338 --> 00:11:12,048
Well, that's okay by me.

192
00:11:14,592 --> 00:11:16,469
Does this happen to you often?

193
00:11:17,637 --> 00:11:18,972
Not often enough.

194
00:11:20,431 --> 00:11:21,474
Well?

195
00:11:23,726 --> 00:11:25,395
We certainly have come a long way fast.

196
00:11:25,562 --> 00:11:26,521
Yeah.

197
00:11:27,689 --> 00:11:29,941
Do you want to take it a step further?

198
00:11:30,817 --> 00:11:31,901
Yeah.

199
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:35,822
What would you think if I asked you
to do something

200
00:11:35,947 --> 00:11:37,991
that might seem a little selfish?

201
00:11:38,366 --> 00:11:40,326
Well, I... I think you should.

202
00:11:40,451 --> 00:11:42,954
Good. Good, because I'd like you
to take a look at my work

203
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:44,497
and tell me what you think.

204
00:11:44,622 --> 00:11:46,916
You see, I really respect
your opinion so much.

205
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:49,669
Well, it's odd,
because I was just gonna ask you

206
00:11:49,794 --> 00:11:50,795
if you had anything
I could take a look at.

207
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,256
I know it's an imposition
but I'd be very grateful and you see,

208
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:55,341
I've read everything
that you've ever written.

209
00:11:55,466 --> 00:11:57,260
Well, I'd be happy to do it. So, that's...

210
00:11:57,427 --> 00:11:58,761
Well, thank you.

211
00:11:59,137 --> 00:12:01,931
Well, then I... I'll get your coat.

212
00:12:03,308 --> 00:12:04,851
Oh, and I hope you won't
be gentle with me.

213
00:12:05,059 --> 00:12:06,519
- Gentle?
- I'm a serious writer.

214
00:12:06,644 --> 00:12:07,604
You can really be tough.

215
00:12:07,729 --> 00:12:09,439
No, I will be. No, I will be.

216
00:12:09,522 --> 00:12:11,107
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

217
00:12:11,566 --> 00:12:14,235
- Do you want me to leave?
- Not really, but I'm late.

218
00:12:14,319 --> 00:12:17,447
- Late at 6:00 in the morning?
- Yes. I have an appointment.

219
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,490
Well, could I see you tomorrow night?

220
00:12:19,616 --> 00:12:20,783
I'm busy tomorrow night.

221
00:12:20,909 --> 00:12:23,286
- Because I'm leaving town the next day.
- Gee, I'm sorry.

222
00:12:23,369 --> 00:12:24,954
So, if you have time,
let me know what you think,

223
00:12:25,038 --> 00:12:27,290
and I'll send you a copy of the interview.

224
00:12:27,707 --> 00:12:29,167
Some interview, huh?

225
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:32,212
Take a look sometime.

226
00:12:33,421 --> 00:12:36,841
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Okay, I understand.

227
00:12:36,925 --> 00:12:38,134
- Bye.
- Bye.

228
00:12:47,352 --> 00:12:49,979
Jack, dear,
do you remember Mr. Hardison?

229
00:12:50,104 --> 00:12:53,024
Used to be at the First Presbyterian
Church, up the hill.

230
00:12:53,107 --> 00:12:56,236
He's in Seattle now
at the big Plymouth church.

231
00:13:00,865 --> 00:13:03,326
What brings you out here, Jack?

232
00:13:03,576 --> 00:13:05,870
Just come out to see your mother?

233
00:13:07,872 --> 00:13:12,377
Mr. Partlow, I just... I'm raising money
for this magazine that I write for.

234
00:13:12,502 --> 00:13:14,337
- What?
- I say, I'm raising money

235
00:13:14,462 --> 00:13:16,464
for this magazine that I write for!

236
00:13:16,548 --> 00:13:18,049
- Magazine? What magazine?
- Yes, sir.

237
00:13:18,174 --> 00:13:19,425
Well, it's called The Masses.

238
00:13:19,551 --> 00:13:21,261
- The what?
- The Masses!

239
00:13:21,386 --> 00:13:22,846
- The Masses.
- Masses.

240
00:13:23,221 --> 00:13:26,182
Jack, do you remember
Mr. Potterson's sister?

241
00:13:26,266 --> 00:13:27,600
The one with the bad arm?

242
00:13:27,725 --> 00:13:30,186
- Is that religious?
- Oh, no, sir. No, sir.

243
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:32,355
Oh, you remember her, Jack.
Her name was Miriam.

244
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,439
She didn't eat meat.

245
00:13:33,565 --> 00:13:35,149
Sounds religious.

246
00:13:35,233 --> 00:13:37,318
You remember the fellow
that was courting her?

247
00:13:37,402 --> 00:13:40,780
Sold spool thread.
Came from down around Eugene.

248
00:13:40,905 --> 00:13:43,116
- Not religious, huh?
- No, sir.

249
00:13:43,241 --> 00:13:46,536
- What was his name, Jack?
- I don't think I remember the name.

250
00:13:46,619 --> 00:13:49,581
Well, I don't know about you people,
but I'm starved.

251
00:13:49,789 --> 00:13:51,165
I don't know, Mrs. Partlow. I...

252
00:13:51,249 --> 00:13:53,543
Jack, I heard you made a few people
a little unhappy

253
00:13:53,668 --> 00:13:54,961
down at the Liberal Club last night.

254
00:13:55,086 --> 00:13:57,172
Oh, Carl,
we're here to have a good time,

255
00:13:57,255 --> 00:13:58,923
let's not go into that.

256
00:13:59,048 --> 00:14:00,800
What was his name, Jack?

257
00:14:00,925 --> 00:14:03,052
- Here you are!
- I can't...

258
00:14:03,136 --> 00:14:04,596
Welcome. So happy...

259
00:14:04,721 --> 00:14:06,347
- Hello, Jack.
- Hello.

260
00:14:06,431 --> 00:14:08,183
Oh, you look wonderful.

261
00:14:13,396 --> 00:14:15,231
Alma, this is Louise Trullinger.

262
00:14:15,356 --> 00:14:19,194
Alma Boyle.
This is Ned Boyle and Jack Reed.

263
00:14:19,277 --> 00:14:21,863
Jack, Louise is quite a progressive
in her own right.

264
00:14:21,946 --> 00:14:22,989
Mr. Partlow.

265
00:14:23,114 --> 00:14:25,867
- How do you do, Mr. Reed?
- How do you do?

266
00:14:26,784 --> 00:14:29,579
Oh, Mr. Partlow, Mrs. Partlow,
this is Louise Trullinger.

267
00:14:29,662 --> 00:14:31,414
- Pleased to meet you.
- Pleased to meet you.

268
00:14:31,497 --> 00:14:33,750
Are you Paul Trullinger's wife?

269
00:14:34,834 --> 00:14:36,586
Yes. Yes, I am.

270
00:14:36,711 --> 00:14:38,588
Well, isn't that something?

271
00:14:38,671 --> 00:14:40,590
He did Frank Rhodes' bridge.

272
00:14:40,673 --> 00:14:44,302
Oh, Mrs. Trullinger, your husband's
the finest dentist in all of Portland.

273
00:14:44,427 --> 00:14:46,513
- Thank you very much.
- Really?

274
00:14:46,638 --> 00:14:48,765
And I think he did a plate
for Uncle Grover.

275
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:51,226
Oh, we won't wait for Harry and Martha.
I could eat a horse.

276
00:14:51,309 --> 00:14:52,352
All right, let's go in.

277
00:14:52,477 --> 00:14:53,978
What a shame Paul
couldn't come tonight.

278
00:14:54,103 --> 00:14:55,271
- An emergency?
- Yes...

279
00:14:55,396 --> 00:14:56,356
Not Uncle Grover's plate, I hope.

280
00:14:56,481 --> 00:14:59,108
- No. Uncle Grover's plate's like new.
- Oh, well...

281
00:15:00,151 --> 00:15:02,612
Did free love start
in Greenwich Village?

282
00:15:03,905 --> 00:15:05,406
Very good wine, Carl.

283
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:09,327
- More, Jack?
- No, no. No, thank you.

284
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,080
It's just delicious, really.

285
00:15:12,205 --> 00:15:14,374
Don't you think so, Mrs. Trullinger?

286
00:15:14,707 --> 00:15:16,501
Yes, it's just delicious.

287
00:15:16,626 --> 00:15:17,794
Thank you, Louise.

288
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:19,963
- Dupont, I think.
- Dupont.

289
00:15:21,172 --> 00:15:22,465
It is Dupont, isn't it, Harry?

290
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:25,885
Mother doesn't want you to get Jack
started on the subject of marriage.

291
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:28,263
You got any children, Mrs. Trullinger?

292
00:15:28,429 --> 00:15:30,056
Not yet, Mr. Reed.

293
00:15:30,181 --> 00:15:31,975
- Call me Jack.
- I've been married 14 years now.

294
00:15:32,058 --> 00:15:34,727
Don't get me in any arguments
about free love.

295
00:15:34,853 --> 00:15:36,062
It's getting cold outside.

296
00:15:36,187 --> 00:15:37,689
I'll just call you Louise.

297
00:15:37,814 --> 00:15:40,483
George Waldorf.
That's it! George Waldorf!

298
00:15:40,608 --> 00:15:42,026
Used to sell spool thread.

299
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:45,446
- What about George Waldorf?
- Well, he died.

300
00:15:46,447 --> 00:15:48,825
I couldn't think of letting
you walk unescorted, Louise.

301
00:15:48,908 --> 00:15:50,034
Tell me something.

302
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:53,663
Does Dr. Trullinger mind your
spending so much time at your studio?

303
00:15:53,788 --> 00:15:56,499
People have to give each other
a little freedom.

304
00:15:56,791 --> 00:15:58,585
Freedom, Mrs. Trullinger?

305
00:15:59,252 --> 00:16:01,379
I'd like to know
what your idea of freedom is.

306
00:16:01,504 --> 00:16:03,923
Having your own studio? Walk...

307
00:16:10,722 --> 00:16:13,516
I'd like to see you
with your pants off, Mr. Reed.

308
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:40,543
Marching and shuffling along

309
00:16:56,184 --> 00:16:57,685
I didn't realize the time.

310
00:16:57,810 --> 00:17:00,855
So, if you like, there's some
very nice damson preserves.

311
00:17:00,939 --> 00:17:03,358
And you can make toast out of that,
if you want.

312
00:17:03,441 --> 00:17:05,652
So, bye.

313
00:17:05,777 --> 00:17:06,903
Where you going?

314
00:17:06,986 --> 00:17:08,238
Where you going?

315
00:17:08,363 --> 00:17:11,032
If you're catching the 2:45, I mean,
you don't really have that much time.

316
00:17:11,115 --> 00:17:13,493
- I'm sure you're gonna want to pack...
- Louise, it's 8:45, only.

317
00:17:13,618 --> 00:17:14,661
It's 8:45.

318
00:17:14,786 --> 00:17:16,579
Listen, I realize
that you're very busy in New York,

319
00:17:16,704 --> 00:17:18,164
but I'd be grateful
if you could take the time

320
00:17:18,289 --> 00:17:19,916
to write a few words to me
about my work.

321
00:17:19,999 --> 00:17:21,167
Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

322
00:17:21,292 --> 00:17:23,753
If you'll just send my portfolio back.
You can mail it to this address...

323
00:17:23,878 --> 00:17:26,506
Louise, wait a minute. What are you
just walking out like that for?

324
00:17:26,631 --> 00:17:29,050
Will you come upstairs, please,
and just talk to me for a minute?

325
00:17:31,886 --> 00:17:33,096
Thank you.

326
00:17:33,763 --> 00:17:35,598
- Listen...
- What is it?

327
00:17:38,226 --> 00:17:39,310
Why don't you come?

328
00:17:39,435 --> 00:17:40,812
- What?
- Come to New York.

329
00:17:40,895 --> 00:17:42,564
You wanna write?
Come where the writers are.

330
00:17:42,647 --> 00:17:45,066
If you wanna have freedom you gotta go
where the freedom is, don't you?

331
00:17:45,149 --> 00:17:47,026
You're gonna go to waste in Portland.
Come to New York.

332
00:17:47,151 --> 00:17:48,987
- You ought to be in New York.
- Thank you very much.

333
00:17:49,112 --> 00:17:50,113
I'll remember that.

334
00:17:50,238 --> 00:17:52,282
- What?
- I'll remember your advice.

335
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,451
Please come with me.

336
00:17:55,743 --> 00:17:57,453
All right, wait a minute.
Let me get this straight.

337
00:17:57,537 --> 00:17:59,622
You want me
to come with you to New York.

338
00:17:59,747 --> 00:18:00,999
Yeah.

339
00:18:01,124 --> 00:18:02,959
What as? What as?

340
00:18:03,084 --> 00:18:04,669
- What do you mean, what...
- What as?

341
00:18:04,794 --> 00:18:07,255
- Your girlfriend?
- What does that mean?

342
00:18:07,338 --> 00:18:08,631
What as? Your girlfriend,

343
00:18:08,715 --> 00:18:11,759
your mistress, your paramour,
your concubine?

344
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:13,636
Why does it have to be as anything?

345
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,471
Because I don't wanna
get into some kind

346
00:18:15,555 --> 00:18:18,892
of emotional possessive involvement
where I'm not able to...

347
00:18:20,393 --> 00:18:22,228
I want to know what as.

348
00:18:22,353 --> 00:18:25,648
Well, it's nearly Thanksgiving.
Why don't you come as a turkey?

349
00:18:27,692 --> 00:18:31,738
I always thought she was
a very earnest girl who went away.

350
00:18:31,863 --> 00:18:36,242
Probably the dentist knew nothing
except about teeth,

351
00:18:36,701 --> 00:18:39,495
and was mainly interested...

352
00:18:39,621 --> 00:18:42,832
And then she had
this wonderful journalist

353
00:18:42,916 --> 00:18:45,210
who could talk about all sorts of things.

354
00:18:45,335 --> 00:18:48,379
I had a coat I brought from Germany.

355
00:18:48,505 --> 00:18:50,757
And she wanted that coat

356
00:18:50,882 --> 00:18:54,844
and made me all kinds of propositions.

357
00:18:55,136 --> 00:18:56,763
But I wanted it, too.

358
00:18:58,097 --> 00:19:00,600
But finally I gave in and gave it to her.

359
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:03,019
I had other coats.

360
00:19:04,395 --> 00:19:09,317
So that's how she operated.

361
00:19:12,529 --> 00:19:15,657
She went after him.
As I say, she got him.

362
00:19:15,949 --> 00:19:18,076
So she wasn't any dummy.

363
00:19:19,536 --> 00:19:23,623
But it was something to happen
in little old Portland.

364
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:25,750
You didn't hear the word "sex."

365
00:19:25,834 --> 00:19:27,710
You didn't hear the word "lesbian."

366
00:19:27,794 --> 00:19:30,046
You didn't hear the word "homosexual."

367
00:19:30,672 --> 00:19:33,132
You didn't hear the word "abortion."

368
00:19:33,258 --> 00:19:34,551
You didn't hear those things.

369
00:19:34,968 --> 00:19:36,386
Men respected women.

370
00:19:36,469 --> 00:19:39,722
They helped them on with their coats,
they opened the doors for them.

371
00:19:39,848 --> 00:19:42,141
And the man and woman
who courted each other,

372
00:19:42,267 --> 00:19:43,560
they married each other.

373
00:19:43,685 --> 00:19:45,854
You know something that I think,

374
00:19:46,229 --> 00:19:50,859
that there was just as much
fucking going on then as now.

375
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:55,113
Only now,
it has a more perverted quality.

376
00:19:55,488 --> 00:19:58,950
Now there's no love whatever included.

377
00:19:59,075 --> 00:20:01,870
Then, there was your heart,
a bit of heart in it.

378
00:20:01,953 --> 00:20:03,955
Greenwich Village was there,

379
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:06,082
and New York was around it.

380
00:20:06,165 --> 00:20:10,086
And the rest of New York did not act
the way Greenwich Village did, exactly.

381
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:12,589
It was sort of a center of dissent

382
00:20:12,964 --> 00:20:16,843
and had been for a long time
in American life.

383
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:19,512
People from all over
the country came there.

384
00:20:20,471 --> 00:20:24,267
They were regarded as bohemian.
Their ways of life were irregular.

385
00:20:24,851 --> 00:20:26,561
The way they dressed

386
00:20:26,811 --> 00:20:28,313
and certainly the way they thought

387
00:20:28,438 --> 00:20:31,191
was outside the mainstream
of American life.

388
00:20:31,316 --> 00:20:32,859
And as I recollect it,

389
00:20:32,984 --> 00:20:35,862
marriage was not important
in Greenwich Village.

390
00:20:35,987 --> 00:20:39,449
I remember hearing a line
Jack said to somebody

391
00:20:39,574 --> 00:20:41,534
he was trying to lure into bed.

392
00:20:41,659 --> 00:20:45,955
She was being very coy, and he said,
"Aren't you pagan enough?"

393
00:20:46,873 --> 00:20:48,124
Hello?

394
00:20:57,425 --> 00:20:59,302
Hello, Jack?

395
00:21:42,178 --> 00:21:44,347
If it's illegal to hand out pamphlets
on birth control,

396
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:45,765
I'm proud to be a criminal.

397
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:49,018
No one is arguing with your
inalienable right to go to jail, Emma.

398
00:21:49,143 --> 00:21:51,271
All I'm saying
is that this is not the right time

399
00:21:51,396 --> 00:21:52,730
to go to jail for birth control.

400
00:21:52,856 --> 00:21:54,774
Oh, there's a right time
to go to jail for birth control?

401
00:21:54,899 --> 00:21:57,026
The Masses is governing
conscience now?

402
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:59,362
Soon you'll be indistinguishable
from The New York Times.

403
00:21:59,445 --> 00:22:02,031
Emma, all I'm saying
is that you are too valuable

404
00:22:02,156 --> 00:22:03,783
- to the anti-war movement.
- You're wrong.

405
00:22:03,908 --> 00:22:07,453
- No, he's right. If we get into this war...
- And you're wrong.

406
00:22:07,579 --> 00:22:10,623
- Will you let me finish my sentence?
- Your sentence is not worth finishing.

407
00:22:10,748 --> 00:22:13,376
Thousands of American women,
overworked, underfed,

408
00:22:13,501 --> 00:22:17,547
are dying, giving birth to anemic
children who can't last out a year.

409
00:22:17,672 --> 00:22:20,466
Are their lives any less valuable
than thousands of American boys'?

410
00:22:20,592 --> 00:22:23,219
- I want those back Tuesday.
- I'm not saying... Do you think?

411
00:22:23,553 --> 00:22:25,388
- Oh, shit.
- Exactly.

412
00:22:25,471 --> 00:22:26,639
Good night.

413
00:22:26,764 --> 00:22:28,683
- You want some coffee?
- Chase and Sanborn?

414
00:22:29,976 --> 00:22:32,437
- I'm out of coffee.
- Again? I'm leaving.

415
00:22:33,396 --> 00:22:36,107
No, the conversation is over.
You're a journalist, Jack.

416
00:22:36,232 --> 00:22:38,359
When you're a revolutionary,
we'll discuss priorities.

417
00:22:38,443 --> 00:22:39,736
Hopefully over coffee.

418
00:22:39,819 --> 00:22:43,072
- It's late, I'll walk you home.
- Why? I won't hurt anybody.

419
00:22:50,914 --> 00:22:52,081
Well...

420
00:22:53,583 --> 00:22:54,626
Yeah.

421
00:22:55,168 --> 00:22:56,794
It's Friday night.

422
00:22:57,045 --> 00:22:58,546
I'm so glad to see you.

423
00:22:58,671 --> 00:23:00,882
Really, I'm so glad to see you.

424
00:23:03,968 --> 00:23:06,262
I finished your articles.
They're very good.

425
00:23:06,346 --> 00:23:09,641
The railroad piece, I think, is...
Needs polishing.

426
00:23:09,974 --> 00:23:11,976
- It's repetitious, but...
- But that's deliberate.

427
00:23:12,101 --> 00:23:13,520
I'm using repetition to make a point.

428
00:23:13,645 --> 00:23:14,938
I don't want it to seem too polished.

429
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:16,940
Oh.

430
00:23:18,149 --> 00:23:20,276
Well, I think
you're gonna love New York.

431
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,070
Emma, Emma, Emma.

432
00:23:22,153 --> 00:23:24,239
I think it was Emma Goldberg.

433
00:23:24,322 --> 00:23:25,323
I think so.

434
00:23:25,448 --> 00:23:27,116
I never forgot Emma Goldman.

435
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,078
She inspired me to the very depths.

436
00:23:30,245 --> 00:23:33,122
And Max Eastman was a beloved man.

437
00:23:33,289 --> 00:23:36,125
The real radical, a free spirit.

438
00:23:36,334 --> 00:23:39,963
He was in that same group
with that Emma Goldman.

439
00:23:40,088 --> 00:23:43,424
That was her name.
Goldman, not Goldberg.

440
00:23:43,508 --> 00:23:45,218
Floyd Dell was one of them.

441
00:23:45,343 --> 00:23:47,470
He wrote novels, beautiful novels.

442
00:23:47,637 --> 00:23:51,307
The radicals included people
like the IWWs

443
00:23:51,391 --> 00:23:52,934
and Bill Haywood.

444
00:23:53,017 --> 00:23:55,228
And there were Walter Lippmann,

445
00:23:55,353 --> 00:23:58,189
and Lincoln Steffens
and Isadora Duncan

446
00:23:58,314 --> 00:24:00,191
and Edna St. Vincent Millay.

447
00:24:00,316 --> 00:24:01,985
Alfred Stieglitz...

448
00:24:02,151 --> 00:24:03,736
Oh, and Margaret Sanger.

449
00:24:03,862 --> 00:24:06,155
My Lord, I picketed for her.

450
00:24:06,239 --> 00:24:08,783
And, of course,
the great writer Eugene O'Neill

451
00:24:08,867 --> 00:24:10,118
came from down there.

452
00:24:10,201 --> 00:24:13,830
I don't think there's anybody
who can touch O'Neill today.

453
00:24:14,205 --> 00:24:18,334
You have to be a bit of a rebel
to be an artist of any kind, I believe.

454
00:24:18,918 --> 00:24:21,921
And everybody in Greenwich Village
was a bit of a rebel.

455
00:24:30,555 --> 00:24:32,348
- What do you do, Louise?
- I write.

456
00:24:32,432 --> 00:24:34,684
Good for you.
Could you pass the bread, please?

457
00:24:34,809 --> 00:24:36,019
- Thanks.
- Because to the middle-class American,

458
00:24:36,102 --> 00:24:38,313
everyone on the left is the same.
An anarchist, a socialist...

459
00:24:46,404 --> 00:24:48,489
Would you pass the bread, please?

460
00:24:49,199 --> 00:24:50,992
- What do you do, Louise?
- I write.

461
00:24:51,075 --> 00:24:53,161
Good. Madame Schumann-Heink...

462
00:24:53,244 --> 00:24:56,581
Jack tells me you write, Miss Bryant.
What do you write about?

463
00:24:57,874 --> 00:24:59,083
Everything.

464
00:25:00,168 --> 00:25:01,503
You write about everything?

465
00:25:02,795 --> 00:25:05,548
Everything. Yes. Everything, nothing...

466
00:25:06,716 --> 00:25:07,926
Just...

467
00:25:09,844 --> 00:25:10,970
I see.

468
00:25:13,223 --> 00:25:15,892
Now, about Davis and Sloan,
have they quit?

469
00:25:16,017 --> 00:25:17,018
Not yet, but they...

470
00:25:24,442 --> 00:25:27,904
I don't think they should sit here
like this. I don't. I think it's cruel.

471
00:25:28,446 --> 00:25:30,114
- It's just...
- Organization, right?

472
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,200
Look, what does a capitalist do?

473
00:25:32,283 --> 00:25:34,285
Let me ask you that, Mike.
Huh? Tell me.

474
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:35,912
I mean, what does he make,
besides money?

475
00:25:36,037 --> 00:25:38,623
I don't know what he makes.
The workers do all the work, don't they?

476
00:25:38,748 --> 00:25:40,166
Well, what if they got organized?

477
00:25:40,291 --> 00:25:42,085
I mean, all the workers.
Not just the plumbers,

478
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:44,254
and the carpenters
and the goddamn cigar makers.

479
00:25:44,379 --> 00:25:45,755
But all of them, all over the world?

480
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:48,383
Not in just one country.
Give him a beer, will you?

481
00:25:48,466 --> 00:25:49,926
What if they all got organized?

482
00:25:50,009 --> 00:25:52,470
Don't you think they could...
They could change society overnight.

483
00:25:52,595 --> 00:25:53,763
They can make it into
anything they wanted.

484
00:25:53,847 --> 00:25:56,307
Jack, can I tap you for $5? I'm flat.

485
00:25:56,474 --> 00:25:59,769
Well, don't ask this pretentious
son of a bitch for money.

486
00:25:59,978 --> 00:26:02,605
If you need $5, I'll give it to you.

487
00:26:05,441 --> 00:26:06,526
Let me have $4.50, will you?

488
00:26:06,651 --> 00:26:08,403
- What isn't fair?
- You see what I'm saying?

489
00:26:08,486 --> 00:26:11,239
If all the workers in the world
belonged to one big union,

490
00:26:11,322 --> 00:26:13,366
- there wouldn't be a war, would there?
- Are you listening to me?

491
00:26:13,491 --> 00:26:14,826
Miss Bryant.

492
00:26:15,493 --> 00:26:17,787
You've been nursing
that beer for an hour.

493
00:26:17,912 --> 00:26:19,497
Can I get you a glass of wine
or something?

494
00:26:19,622 --> 00:26:21,583
No, thank you. I'm fine.
Thank you, anyway.

495
00:26:21,708 --> 00:26:24,335
- Beer's fine.
- You are an amiable person.

496
00:26:24,669 --> 00:26:26,296
And a very good painter, I hear.

497
00:26:27,422 --> 00:26:28,631
I write.

498
00:26:38,725 --> 00:26:40,185
Read Jung!

499
00:26:40,518 --> 00:26:42,896
"Read Freud, read Jung."
Read Engels, read Marx!

500
00:26:43,021 --> 00:26:45,982
My God, you can't interpret Freud
in an economic context.

501
00:26:46,107 --> 00:26:47,942
You know you got a taxi waiting?

502
00:26:48,026 --> 00:26:50,278
Zosima represents
the corruption of religion.

503
00:26:50,361 --> 00:26:51,362
I tell you you're wrong.

504
00:26:51,446 --> 00:26:54,574
- And Jung is a mystic...
- But do you seriously believe...

505
00:26:56,409 --> 00:27:00,371
- How long are they going to stay?
- I don't know. They'll get out in a while.

506
00:27:00,455 --> 00:27:03,499
- I'll only be gone for a day.
- You just got back from Boston.

507
00:27:03,583 --> 00:27:05,001
Hey, why don't you come
with me to Baltimore?

508
00:27:05,084 --> 00:27:07,295
Really? What am I supposed
to come to Baltimore as?

509
00:27:07,378 --> 00:27:08,671
What as?

510
00:27:08,796 --> 00:27:11,132
Jack, you know, you got a taxi waiting.

511
00:27:12,342 --> 00:27:13,801
Taxi's waiting, Jack.

512
00:27:14,886 --> 00:27:16,179
See you tomorrow.

513
00:27:23,895 --> 00:27:26,356
We've been trying for two years.

514
00:27:26,439 --> 00:27:29,734
Capitalists can take this country into
war any time they damn well please.

515
00:27:29,859 --> 00:27:31,986
The only impact you can make
is in the streets.

516
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:33,112
Of course, but...

517
00:27:33,238 --> 00:27:35,198
But don't you think, Emma,

518
00:27:36,324 --> 00:27:39,035
that if Debs gets a lot of votes,
it'll strengthen that image?

519
00:27:39,118 --> 00:27:41,913
No, I don't. I think voting is the opium
of the masses in this country.

520
00:27:42,038 --> 00:27:43,873
Every four years, you deaden the pain.

521
00:27:43,998 --> 00:27:45,166
Yeah, but...

522
00:27:47,001 --> 00:27:48,127
Don't you think...

523
00:27:48,253 --> 00:27:51,214
I just made it very clear
what I think, Miss Bryant.

524
00:27:51,339 --> 00:27:53,508
Come on, E.G.
Don't be so goddamn dogmatic.

525
00:27:53,591 --> 00:27:56,594
- Louise has a point. She says...
- Suddenly I'm dogmatic.

526
00:27:56,678 --> 00:27:59,597
Why does my status change
every time you get a new woman, Jack?

527
00:27:59,681 --> 00:28:02,892
Bernie, could I have the red wine?
Louise, would you like a glass?

528
00:28:02,976 --> 00:28:04,978
She's just... She's upset with me.

529
00:28:05,103 --> 00:28:07,897
It's got nothing to do with you.
Nothing to do with you.

530
00:28:07,981 --> 00:28:10,650
Thank you. It's a great comfort.

531
00:28:11,025 --> 00:28:13,528
The house is completely filled
with people when you're gone.

532
00:28:13,653 --> 00:28:15,488
They use it as if it was
a meeting hall or something.

533
00:28:15,613 --> 00:28:17,782
- I can't get any work done.
- Just throw them out.

534
00:28:17,907 --> 00:28:19,576
- How am I supposed to throw them out?
- Just kick them out.

535
00:28:19,659 --> 00:28:20,743
Tell them to leave.

536
00:28:20,827 --> 00:28:22,287
I'm not going to
say to Max Eastman, "Leave."

537
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:23,788
- Just throw them out.
- Jack?

538
00:28:23,913 --> 00:28:26,666
Jack, is that you?
Jack, it's very good to see you.

539
00:28:26,791 --> 00:28:29,252
- Hello, Horace. How are you?
- Very good to see you.

540
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:33,298
- You know Louise Bryant?
- Yes, hello. How are you?

541
00:28:33,423 --> 00:28:35,425
- Very nice to see you.
- How do you do?

542
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:36,593
Great pleasure.

543
00:28:36,718 --> 00:28:38,678
- Hi, Max. How are you?
- Divine, Horace.

544
00:28:38,803 --> 00:28:40,597
- And Floyd, good to see you.
- Hello, Horace.

545
00:28:40,805 --> 00:28:42,724
Still getting arrested, Jack?

546
00:28:42,807 --> 00:28:43,933
I try.

547
00:28:46,144 --> 00:28:47,187
How about you, Miss Bryant?

548
00:28:47,312 --> 00:28:49,272
Are you trying to get arrested, too?

549
00:28:49,397 --> 00:28:50,899
No, not really.

550
00:28:52,817 --> 00:28:55,945
- What do you do, Miss Bryant?
- I write.

551
00:28:56,487 --> 00:29:00,533
You write? Now, may I ask,
what are you working on?

552
00:29:02,452 --> 00:29:04,621
It's impossible to describe.

553
00:29:04,746 --> 00:29:06,164
It's impossible to describe?

554
00:29:06,247 --> 00:29:07,248
She just did a hell of a piece

555
00:29:07,373 --> 00:29:09,626
on the influence of the Armory Show
and you ought to read it.

556
00:29:09,709 --> 00:29:11,920
Well, you know,
I very much would like to read that.

557
00:29:12,462 --> 00:29:14,881
Why don't you give me a call
at The Metropolitan?

558
00:29:15,131 --> 00:29:17,926
In fact, even better,
why don't we have a drink on Thursday?

559
00:29:18,009 --> 00:29:20,678
- Fine.
- We can talk about the Armory Show.

560
00:29:20,803 --> 00:29:22,013
- It's a date, then.
- Well, all right.

561
00:29:22,138 --> 00:29:23,598
That's wonderful. Fine.

562
00:29:23,681 --> 00:29:24,933
Jack!

563
00:29:27,852 --> 00:29:30,355
Now, you stay out
of the slammer, now, okay?

564
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:35,318
Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye.
It's nice to see you.

565
00:29:37,362 --> 00:29:39,197
- Jack, please don't do that.
- What?

566
00:29:39,322 --> 00:29:41,449
He's the editor of Metropolitan.
I've known him for years.

567
00:29:41,533 --> 00:29:44,577
- Jack, I can speak for myself.
- So can your work.

568
00:29:44,702 --> 00:29:46,120
- I don't want you to do that...
- Taxi's waiting, Jack.

569
00:29:46,204 --> 00:29:48,164
Oh. Taxi's waiting, Jack.

570
00:29:52,836 --> 00:29:54,003
Jack...

571
00:29:55,255 --> 00:29:57,715
I'll see you at the end
of the week, okay?

572
00:29:59,217 --> 00:30:00,301
- Okay?
- Wait. Wait.

573
00:30:00,385 --> 00:30:02,804
Maybe I will call him about Thursday.

574
00:30:02,887 --> 00:30:05,515
Yeah, call him about Thursday.
Yeah, yeah.

575
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,308
- See you, boys.
- Bye-bye, Jack.

576
00:30:07,392 --> 00:30:09,227
- Bye-bye, Jack.
- See you.

577
00:30:10,061 --> 00:30:11,646
See you, Jack.

578
00:30:17,694 --> 00:30:19,946
"The railroad's opening new frontiers,

579
00:30:20,321 --> 00:30:23,074
"and crisscrossing it all
are the railroads.

580
00:30:23,199 --> 00:30:25,451
"The railroad's opening new frontiers,

581
00:30:25,577 --> 00:30:27,871
"and in turn, these frontiers...

582
00:30:28,162 --> 00:30:30,373
"And in turn, these frontiers..."

583
00:30:30,498 --> 00:30:31,708
Oh, God.

584
00:30:34,794 --> 00:30:36,296
It is repetitious.

585
00:30:40,049 --> 00:30:42,093
We're not human beings,
we're a commodity.

586
00:30:42,218 --> 00:30:43,845
- And how many days a week?
- Seven days.

587
00:30:43,928 --> 00:30:45,054
- Every day?
- They said,

588
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:48,391
"If you don't come to work on Sunday,
don't come on Monday."

589
00:30:48,516 --> 00:30:50,518
- What do you make an hour?
- 20 cents.

590
00:30:50,602 --> 00:30:53,313
How many times have they
slammed the door on your face

591
00:30:53,438 --> 00:30:55,899
because the labor you do
is called unskilled?

592
00:30:55,982 --> 00:30:57,066
That's right, Bill.

593
00:30:57,192 --> 00:30:59,527
Well, the IWW's not gonna
turn you down

594
00:30:59,611 --> 00:31:01,321
- because you're unskilled.
- Listen to him, George.

595
00:31:01,738 --> 00:31:05,200
Or skilled. Or black or white or yellow.

596
00:31:05,325 --> 00:31:06,576
Seven days a week.

597
00:31:06,701 --> 00:31:08,745
- What do you make an hour?
- 10 cents an hour.

598
00:31:08,828 --> 00:31:09,787
One big union.

599
00:31:10,413 --> 00:31:14,083
- All workers belong...
- Listen, read that. That's important.

600
00:31:14,584 --> 00:31:17,420
I'm looking for a lathe worker
named Pasquale Alberti.

601
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:20,507
He had an industrial accident. He got
his leg crushed. Do you know him?

602
00:31:20,632 --> 00:31:22,133
Yeah, sure, Harvard.

603
00:31:22,258 --> 00:31:24,677
Is that what they wanna read about
in Greenwich Village now,

604
00:31:24,802 --> 00:31:25,929
industrial accidents?

605
00:31:28,848 --> 00:31:30,725
And for that, we need power.

606
00:31:31,017 --> 00:31:33,603
And there's only one way to get power.

607
00:31:33,937 --> 00:31:35,146
Organize!

608
00:31:35,271 --> 00:31:37,607
All the workers together!

609
00:31:37,732 --> 00:31:39,442
One big union!

610
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:44,239
And the war the IWW
wants you to get into is class war!

611
00:31:44,322 --> 00:31:46,032
Not a war in Europe!

612
00:31:46,157 --> 00:31:48,284
War against the capitalists!

613
00:31:48,409 --> 00:31:50,787
You'll never get anything or anywhere,

614
00:31:50,912 --> 00:31:54,707
until the whole working class
belongs to one big...

615
00:31:55,333 --> 00:31:57,001
All right, gentlemen,

616
00:31:57,126 --> 00:32:00,004
you've got 20 seconds
to vacate the premises.

617
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:09,347
May I ask on what authority?

618
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:11,015
On my authority.

619
00:32:11,224 --> 00:32:13,142
This is an illegal assembly.

620
00:32:13,226 --> 00:32:15,728
Excuse me, Officer. These men
have the legal right to assemble.

621
00:32:15,854 --> 00:32:17,021
That's all they're doing.

622
00:32:17,146 --> 00:32:18,815
We know what the hell they doing.

623
00:32:18,898 --> 00:32:20,817
- What the hell you doing?
- Me?

624
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:21,985
You.

625
00:32:22,068 --> 00:32:23,528
- I write.
- You write?

626
00:32:24,612 --> 00:32:25,655
You wrong.

627
00:32:29,534 --> 00:32:31,035
Get him out of here!

628
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,417
Here they are.

629
00:32:37,542 --> 00:32:38,710
The folio. The oeuvre.

630
00:32:42,046 --> 00:32:43,214
Well...

631
00:32:44,424 --> 00:32:45,675
How is Jack?

632
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:49,220
I do hope he's being more careful
about what he's writing these days.

633
00:32:49,345 --> 00:32:51,306
I'd hate to see him not able
to get into print.

634
00:32:51,431 --> 00:32:53,183
Oh, I'm sure he'll do fine.

635
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:58,062
Did you tell him
where we were having drinks?

636
00:32:58,229 --> 00:33:00,064
No, I will. He's out of town.

637
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:03,568
Mr. Whigham, excuse me, but
the Armory Show piece is on the top.

638
00:33:03,693 --> 00:33:05,612
Oh, this is the Armory...

639
00:33:05,737 --> 00:33:08,698
- Yes.
- Yes. Of course. Here it is.

640
00:33:15,538 --> 00:33:16,831
Well...

641
00:33:17,624 --> 00:33:19,918
I really ought to spend
more time on this.

642
00:33:20,043 --> 00:33:21,461
Oh, yes, of course.

643
00:33:21,836 --> 00:33:23,171
What about dinner?

644
00:33:24,255 --> 00:33:26,549
- Dinner?
- Jack wouldn't mind.

645
00:33:27,717 --> 00:33:30,553
- Why would he mind?
- Well, we're all grownups, of course,

646
00:33:30,678 --> 00:33:32,555
but Jack's rather...

647
00:33:33,181 --> 00:33:35,016
He's rather an odd duck, isn't he?

648
00:33:35,099 --> 00:33:36,351
And I've never really known how...

649
00:33:36,434 --> 00:33:37,727
Mr. Whigham, are you saying you need

650
00:33:37,810 --> 00:33:40,063
Jack's permission
to make a pass at me?

651
00:33:43,107 --> 00:33:44,234
Don't get so upset about it.

652
00:33:44,317 --> 00:33:46,069
For Christ's sake,
I made two little tiny changes...

653
00:33:46,194 --> 00:33:47,654
Don't rewrite what I write, Pete.

654
00:33:47,779 --> 00:33:49,822
What the hell's the matter
with you, Jack?

655
00:33:49,948 --> 00:33:52,033
The IWW's a bunch of Reds.

656
00:33:52,116 --> 00:33:53,201
Come on.

657
00:33:53,493 --> 00:33:55,787
We got Reds in the IWW,
got Reds in the Village.

658
00:33:55,912 --> 00:33:57,622
We've got nothing
but Reds around here.

659
00:33:57,747 --> 00:34:00,625
For Christ's sake,
you're the best goddamn writer around.

660
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:02,377
Now, what the hell
you wanna waste your time

661
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:04,587
with a lot of Red propaganda
nobody's ever gonna print?

662
00:34:04,712 --> 00:34:06,631
It's the truth.
Does that mean anything around here?

663
00:34:06,756 --> 00:34:08,258
Well, who the hell's to say
what the truth is?

664
00:34:08,383 --> 00:34:10,260
A bunch of goddamn Reds in the IWW?

665
00:34:10,343 --> 00:34:12,303
You're not being fair to the AF of L.

666
00:34:12,387 --> 00:34:15,181
- Now, give me the goddamn article...
- You're gonna rewrite what I write.

667
00:34:15,306 --> 00:34:17,392
I'm just gonna take it
to a magazine that won't.

668
00:34:17,475 --> 00:34:19,102
Well, fine. Take it to The Masses.

669
00:34:19,227 --> 00:34:20,520
- They're a bunch of Reds.
- Thank you.

670
00:34:20,645 --> 00:34:22,730
- Who's gonna pay your rent?
- Rent's easy, Pete.

671
00:34:22,814 --> 00:34:25,692
You just don't rewrite what I write.
You got that? Don't rewrite what I write.

672
00:34:25,817 --> 00:34:28,903
You stubborn son of a bitch.
Who's gonna pay your rent?

673
00:34:45,003 --> 00:34:46,129
Louise?

674
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:06,024
I got every one in the shop.

675
00:35:06,691 --> 00:35:08,693
We're broke, but we've got them all.

676
00:35:12,864 --> 00:35:13,907
Thanks.

677
00:35:18,036 --> 00:35:19,954
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

678
00:35:20,038 --> 00:35:22,790
- What is it?
- It's nothing. How'd it go?

679
00:35:23,041 --> 00:35:24,667
A lot better than we thought it would.

680
00:35:24,792 --> 00:35:27,629
- You see Whigham?
- Yesterday.

681
00:35:27,712 --> 00:35:30,673
- How was that?
- We mostly talked about you, of course.

682
00:35:30,757 --> 00:35:32,217
Did he offer you work?

683
00:35:32,342 --> 00:35:34,052
No, but he made a big point
of telling me

684
00:35:34,177 --> 00:35:36,763
what wonderful friends
you and he have become over the years.

685
00:35:36,888 --> 00:35:38,765
It was a fascinating meeting.

686
00:35:40,225 --> 00:35:42,185
Are you angry at Whigham or me?

687
00:35:44,812 --> 00:35:45,897
What is it?

688
00:35:46,231 --> 00:35:48,107
It's nothing.
You said you'd be back Tuesday

689
00:35:48,233 --> 00:35:49,442
and it's Saturday.

690
00:35:49,734 --> 00:35:51,486
Didn't I say I'd back
at the end of the week?

691
00:35:51,569 --> 00:35:53,863
- The end of the week is Friday.
- The end of the week is Friday?

692
00:35:53,988 --> 00:35:55,406
Saturday's not the
end of the week anymore, huh?

693
00:35:55,532 --> 00:35:56,908
Jack, you said you'd be back Tuesday!

694
00:35:57,033 --> 00:35:58,076
What difference does it make?

695
00:35:58,201 --> 00:35:59,285
What do you think I've been doing?

696
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:01,246
Running around listening
to the sound of my own voice?

697
00:36:01,371 --> 00:36:03,331
How do I know whose voice
you've been listening to?

698
00:36:03,414 --> 00:36:05,959
Obviously you like it
a lot better than mine!

699
00:36:16,803 --> 00:36:18,513
Look at me. Oh, God!

700
00:36:19,514 --> 00:36:20,890
I'm like a wife.

701
00:36:22,684 --> 00:36:27,605
I'm like a boring, clinging,
miserable little wife.

702
00:36:28,898 --> 00:36:31,359
- Who'd wanna come home to me?
- Me!

703
00:36:31,943 --> 00:36:33,736
Well, I can't do this!
I can't do this anymore!

704
00:36:33,862 --> 00:36:35,321
You can't do what?

705
00:36:36,614 --> 00:36:38,116
I'm just living in your margins.

706
00:36:38,241 --> 00:36:40,785
I don't know what I'm doing here.
I don't know what my purpose is.

707
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:44,080
- Well, tell me what you want.
- I want to stop needing you!

708
00:36:44,247 --> 00:36:45,206
I want you to know something.

709
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:47,750
I asked Whigham
if he'd send me to France.

710
00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:52,672
- Is that what you want?
- That's what I want.

711
00:36:57,051 --> 00:36:59,262
- What are you doing, Louise?
- I can't work around you.

712
00:36:59,345 --> 00:37:00,346
Will you tell me why you're doing this?

713
00:37:00,471 --> 00:37:02,182
I'm not taken seriously
when you're around.

714
00:37:02,307 --> 00:37:03,600
When I'm around
you're not taken seriously?

715
00:37:03,683 --> 00:37:04,851
Oh, God, this is not good.

716
00:37:04,976 --> 00:37:06,352
You mean
you think I'm taken more seriously?

717
00:37:06,477 --> 00:37:07,437
Is that what you're talking about?

718
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,147
Do you mean you're not?
Come on, Jack.

719
00:37:09,272 --> 00:37:11,357
You know what I'm saying.
You're not being honest with me.

720
00:37:11,482 --> 00:37:12,483
I don't know what you're saying.

721
00:37:12,609 --> 00:37:15,153
You're not being honest with me.
Please, be honest with me.

722
00:37:15,278 --> 00:37:16,237
I am so being honest with you.

723
00:37:16,362 --> 00:37:19,115
Maybe if you took yourself a little more
seriously, other people would, too.

724
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,783
I told you what I thought
about the Armory piece.

725
00:37:20,909 --> 00:37:21,910
I was honest about that.

726
00:37:21,993 --> 00:37:24,495
I think it's very nice,
but no, I don't take it very seriously.

727
00:37:24,621 --> 00:37:25,663
- Thank you.
- Why do you even expect

728
00:37:25,788 --> 00:37:28,833
to be taken seriously if you're
not writing about serious things?

729
00:37:28,958 --> 00:37:30,168
I don't understand that.

730
00:37:30,293 --> 00:37:32,420
I found myself an apartment.
I'm looking for one.

731
00:37:32,504 --> 00:37:34,589
I'm not even sure I know
what things you're serious about.

732
00:37:34,672 --> 00:37:35,965
One day you're writing
about the railroads,

733
00:37:36,049 --> 00:37:37,258
and you don't even finish the piece.

734
00:37:37,342 --> 00:37:39,302
The next day you're doing a piece
on an art exhibition

735
00:37:39,385 --> 00:37:40,803
that happened three years ago.

736
00:37:40,929 --> 00:37:42,680
Look, why do you give me
anything to read, anyway?

737
00:37:42,805 --> 00:37:45,225
If I criticize it at all,
you tell me you like it the way it is.

738
00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:46,726
And when we're out with other people,

739
00:37:46,851 --> 00:37:48,603
if somebody doesn't ask you
a direct question,

740
00:37:48,686 --> 00:37:50,021
you tell me you feel ignored.

741
00:37:50,146 --> 00:37:52,148
But with everything
that's happening in the world today,

742
00:37:52,273 --> 00:37:53,900
you decide to sit down and write a piece

743
00:37:54,025 --> 00:37:57,737
on the influence of the goddamned
Armory Show of 1913!

744
00:37:57,862 --> 00:37:59,489
Are people supposed
to take that seriously?

745
00:37:59,614 --> 00:38:00,823
Well, I don't really care!

746
00:38:00,949 --> 00:38:02,325
- You care!
- I'm not really... I don't care!

747
00:38:02,408 --> 00:38:03,952
- You care!
- I don't care!

748
00:38:04,077 --> 00:38:07,121
And I'm not interested
in whether your stupid friends

749
00:38:07,247 --> 00:38:09,415
- take me seriously or not!
- Well, they don't take it seriously.

750
00:38:09,541 --> 00:38:10,708
That's why they don't take it seriously.

751
00:38:10,834 --> 00:38:12,919
I found an apartment on Houston Street,
and I'm moving in.

752
00:38:13,044 --> 00:38:15,547
And I'll tell you something else,
Jack Reed.

753
00:38:15,672 --> 00:38:18,007
I don't think we like the same people
or the same kind of life.

754
00:38:18,091 --> 00:38:20,093
- And I wanna be on my own.
- Go ahead, be on your own!

755
00:38:20,218 --> 00:38:21,761
I don't give a damn!
You're on your own anyway.

756
00:38:21,886 --> 00:38:23,471
Oh! I know you don't give a damn!

757
00:38:23,555 --> 00:38:25,181
Well, will you tell me
why the hell I should give a damn?

758
00:38:25,306 --> 00:38:26,558
You shouldn't! Don't give a damn!

759
00:38:26,683 --> 00:38:29,185
- I don't give a damn, either!
- That's right! I don't give a damn!

760
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:32,647
- I'm getting out of here!
- Good, fine! I'm leaving, too!

761
00:39:19,694 --> 00:39:23,364
Honey, can we just
get out of New York?

762
00:39:24,616 --> 00:39:26,784
Let's go somewhere
and just write what we wanna write.

763
00:40:00,818 --> 00:40:05,740
Provincetown was
just a tiny little fishing village.

764
00:40:06,157 --> 00:40:09,744
And it was very, very conservative.

765
00:40:10,203 --> 00:40:13,748
We'd take the Fall River steamer
up there, I remember, every summer.

766
00:40:13,831 --> 00:40:16,417
We used to save fares
by sleeping in tiers.

767
00:40:16,501 --> 00:40:18,419
And we always got bedbugs.

768
00:40:18,503 --> 00:40:20,505
You did whatever you pleased up there.

769
00:40:20,588 --> 00:40:24,050
And we put on some very
interesting plays, experimental plays

770
00:40:24,175 --> 00:40:26,594
that a commercial theater
couldn't possibly do.

771
00:40:26,678 --> 00:40:29,514
Take Susan Glaspell's Trifles.

772
00:40:29,681 --> 00:40:31,182
There's a whole play

773
00:40:31,307 --> 00:40:34,686
without the protagonist
even appearing on the stage.

774
00:40:34,811 --> 00:40:37,230
And they gave three one-act plays.

775
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:39,440
One of them was a play by...

776
00:40:39,524 --> 00:40:43,069
I always thought it was by John Reed
and Louise Bryant.

777
00:40:43,361 --> 00:40:45,029
But I see it's by her.

778
00:40:45,154 --> 00:40:46,155
They were in it.

779
00:40:46,281 --> 00:40:49,075
The play was terrible,
and they were worse.

780
00:40:49,701 --> 00:40:52,662
And of course, Gene O'Neill
was known as the poet,

781
00:40:53,037 --> 00:40:55,957
but I liked his plays
better than his poetry.

782
00:40:56,583 --> 00:40:57,667
Will you never understand?

783
00:40:57,792 --> 00:41:00,378
Are you so stupid
that you do not know what I mean?

784
00:41:00,503 --> 00:41:02,172
I am offering myself to you.

785
00:41:02,255 --> 00:41:04,174
I am kneeling before you.

786
00:41:04,424 --> 00:41:06,509
I have promised you my body,

787
00:41:06,634 --> 00:41:08,845
my body that men have
found so beautiful.

788
00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:12,724
I have promised to love you,
a negro sailor!

789
00:41:13,850 --> 00:41:16,895
Tell them not to stand behind the moon.

790
00:41:17,478 --> 00:41:19,105
Don't stand behind the moon.

791
00:41:19,397 --> 00:41:21,065
- Back?
- Can you step back a little bit?

792
00:41:21,691 --> 00:41:22,817
'Cause of the moon.

793
00:41:22,901 --> 00:41:24,485
This is the moon here.

794
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:25,987
- This way?
- Yes.

795
00:41:26,237 --> 00:41:28,239
Take it from "I hate the sea."

796
00:41:28,406 --> 00:41:29,490
Will you never understand?

797
00:41:29,574 --> 00:41:31,618
Are you so stupid
that you don't know what I mean?

798
00:41:31,743 --> 00:41:33,453
I'm offering myself to you.

799
00:41:33,578 --> 00:41:35,872
I'm kneeling before you.

800
00:41:35,955 --> 00:41:38,791
I... I, who have had so many men
kneel before me,

801
00:41:38,917 --> 00:41:40,752
I'm offering you my body,

802
00:41:40,877 --> 00:41:43,755
my body that men have
found so beautiful.

803
00:41:44,422 --> 00:41:46,466
I have promised to love you.

804
00:41:46,591 --> 00:41:48,468
You, a negro sailor.

805
00:41:48,593 --> 00:41:52,055
Is that not humiliation enough
that you must keep me waiting so?

806
00:41:52,347 --> 00:41:54,349
Answer me, please! Answer me.

807
00:41:54,474 --> 00:41:56,392
Will you give me that water?

808
00:41:57,852 --> 00:41:59,729
I have no water.

809
00:42:00,563 --> 00:42:02,315
Old Teddy wants this war, doesn't he?

810
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:04,984
I wonder how long it'll take the public
to find out he's a maniac.

811
00:42:05,109 --> 00:42:07,737
Teddy Roosevelt has rabies.
Universal military training.

812
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:09,447
Jack, your second speech is out.

813
00:42:09,572 --> 00:42:12,283
And the ironic part of it is
that poor people, they love him.

814
00:42:12,408 --> 00:42:15,245
Sure, they do.
They'll take him up San Juan Hill again.

815
00:42:15,370 --> 00:42:17,205
You can't touch the bunny suit.
It's rented.

816
00:42:17,288 --> 00:42:18,581
Did you read the piece
on the convention?

817
00:42:18,706 --> 00:42:21,084
If the left doesn't defend Wilson,
we're gonna get President Hughes.

818
00:42:21,167 --> 00:42:22,293
Think we ought to go to St. Louis?

819
00:42:22,418 --> 00:42:24,170
I am not going to St. Louis
to defend Wilson.

820
00:42:24,295 --> 00:42:26,256
- I think we should.
- Why? What good would it do?

821
00:42:26,339 --> 00:42:28,216
I don't know,
if you don't think Hughes would have us

822
00:42:28,299 --> 00:42:30,385
in a war in a few months,
it wouldn't do any good at all.

823
00:42:30,468 --> 00:42:32,095
Wilson's kept us out so far.

824
00:42:32,804 --> 00:42:34,514
Reed thought that he was a good poet.

825
00:42:34,639 --> 00:42:36,432
He was a terrible poet.

826
00:42:36,641 --> 00:42:38,893
He thought that he could write
good novels.

827
00:42:38,977 --> 00:42:40,186
Short stories.

828
00:42:40,603 --> 00:42:42,021
Of course, he was a poet.

829
00:42:42,146 --> 00:42:45,608
And not a great poet,

830
00:42:46,025 --> 00:42:48,444
but some of it was very fine.

831
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:52,699
But, as a journalist,
Jack Reed topped them all.

832
00:42:53,199 --> 00:42:55,243
- Look. Pull this up.
- Hey, Jack.

833
00:42:55,368 --> 00:42:57,120
See? That's good.

834
00:42:57,453 --> 00:42:59,038
Jack, your ride's here.

835
00:42:59,914 --> 00:43:02,625
- Excuse me. I'll wait outside.
- Okay. Okay.

836
00:43:04,169 --> 00:43:07,213
- Do you see what I mean? If one...
- Jack, the taxi's waiting.

837
00:43:11,217 --> 00:43:12,635
Yeah, I got to run.

838
00:43:16,055 --> 00:43:17,098
Bye, honey.

839
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:27,233
Jack Reed wanted to stir up trouble,

840
00:43:27,358 --> 00:43:29,652
he wanted to stir up trouble
for the capitalists.

841
00:43:29,736 --> 00:43:33,114
And he also wanted
to arouse the working masses

842
00:43:33,364 --> 00:43:36,826
to the necessity of some
kind of effective united action.

843
00:43:37,035 --> 00:43:41,873
In other words, I am accusing him
of either being a busybody

844
00:43:42,123 --> 00:43:45,919
or of being a fraidy-cat,

845
00:43:46,044 --> 00:43:48,254
not wanting to face things
of his own nature.

846
00:43:52,634 --> 00:43:56,095
Dear Louise, St. Louis is very hot
and very crowded with Democrats,

847
00:43:56,221 --> 00:43:59,057
all having a wonderful time
and wearing little paper hats

848
00:43:59,182 --> 00:44:01,017
in anticipation of Wilson's nomination.

849
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:02,268
I'd like to think it's because

850
00:44:02,393 --> 00:44:04,312
he doesn't want the United States
to go into the war,

851
00:44:04,395 --> 00:44:06,231
but who knows
the mind of a Democrat?

852
00:44:06,356 --> 00:44:09,234
By the way, I've decided to throw out
the poem on white lilies.

853
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:10,818
The rhyming scheme was wrong.

854
00:44:10,902 --> 00:44:12,987
Maybe when I get back
I can start it again.

855
00:44:13,112 --> 00:44:15,657
Politics sure plays hell
with your poetry.

856
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:18,535
I keep thinking I see you.
It's the damnedest thing.

857
00:44:18,618 --> 00:44:21,120
I miss you, honey.
I miss walking on the beach.

858
00:45:05,623 --> 00:45:07,709
- Hello.
- Where's the whiskey?

859
00:45:17,135 --> 00:45:18,720
Would you like a glass?

860
00:45:27,854 --> 00:45:29,397
Don't try and decide.

861
00:45:30,148 --> 00:45:31,482
I'll get you one.

862
00:45:36,905 --> 00:45:38,448
I like your play.

863
00:45:38,573 --> 00:45:41,284
I only hope I can do the part justice.

864
00:45:41,993 --> 00:45:44,495
I think your dialogue is beautiful.
I really do, I love it...

865
00:45:44,621 --> 00:45:46,789
Then why the hell
don't you just stand still and say it

866
00:45:46,873 --> 00:45:48,958
instead of wandering all over the stage?

867
00:45:49,083 --> 00:45:51,377
You're supposed to be looking
for your soul, not an ashtray.

868
00:45:51,503 --> 00:45:52,795
Would you rather I didn't smoke
during rehearsals?

869
00:45:52,879 --> 00:45:55,465
I'd rather you went up in flames
than put out your cigarette

870
00:45:55,590 --> 00:45:57,467
in the middle
of a monologue about birth.

871
00:45:57,592 --> 00:45:58,593
I'm sorry. You're absolutely right.

872
00:45:58,676 --> 00:46:00,470
It makes me wanna cancel
the whole production.

873
00:46:00,595 --> 00:46:03,306
I won't do it again.
Excuse me, I'm sorry.

874
00:46:13,191 --> 00:46:15,568
You keep the glass. I'll take the bottle.

875
00:46:16,069 --> 00:46:17,612
Are you leaving?

876
00:46:18,279 --> 00:46:19,739
Give me your glass.

877
00:46:31,125 --> 00:46:32,502
Are you nervous?

878
00:46:33,461 --> 00:46:36,798
- Or is that a tremor?
- Why aren't you in Chicago with Jack?

879
00:46:36,881 --> 00:46:39,634
Why should I be?
He has his things, I have mine.

880
00:46:51,813 --> 00:46:53,898
- What are they?
- What?

881
00:46:57,569 --> 00:47:01,197
The things that you have that are yours.

882
00:47:01,614 --> 00:47:02,824
What are they?

883
00:47:04,951 --> 00:47:06,536
My work, for one.

884
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:10,206
He's a real mean
son of a bitch, isn't he?

885
00:47:10,915 --> 00:47:12,208
What do you mean?

886
00:47:12,333 --> 00:47:14,627
Leaving you alone with your work.

887
00:47:15,336 --> 00:47:18,089
- You think I mind?
- You should.

888
00:47:19,090 --> 00:47:21,426
It's the one thing
we mustn't be left alone with.

889
00:47:21,551 --> 00:47:24,012
- You may feel that way, I don't.
- Good.

890
00:47:24,137 --> 00:47:28,099
Don't let those village radicals keep you
from being what you should be.

891
00:47:28,641 --> 00:47:30,560
What do you think I should be?

892
00:47:31,227 --> 00:47:33,188
The center of attention.

893
00:47:34,272 --> 00:47:36,816
Well, you must have been
with some very competitive women.

894
00:47:37,609 --> 00:47:39,360
Let's just say possessive.

895
00:47:39,527 --> 00:47:42,197
Possessive? That's something else.

896
00:47:42,447 --> 00:47:43,948
It's a waste of time.

897
00:47:44,657 --> 00:47:45,867
I'm not.

898
00:47:46,951 --> 00:47:49,037
Neither is Jack, for that matter.

899
00:47:49,245 --> 00:47:52,665
Oh, yes. I know.
You and Jack have your own things.

900
00:47:52,790 --> 00:47:55,710
He has the freedom to do the things
that he wants to and so do I.

901
00:47:55,793 --> 00:47:57,795
And I think anyone who's afraid
of that kind of freedom

902
00:47:57,879 --> 00:47:59,923
is really only afraid
of his own emptiness.

903
00:48:01,549 --> 00:48:03,384
Are you making this up
as you go along?

904
00:48:05,303 --> 00:48:06,971
I'd like you to go.

905
00:48:09,557 --> 00:48:10,558
Why?

906
00:48:10,767 --> 00:48:12,101
Because I don't want to be patronized.

907
00:48:12,185 --> 00:48:14,229
I'm sorry if you don't believe
in mutual independence

908
00:48:14,312 --> 00:48:15,605
and free love and respect.

909
00:48:15,730 --> 00:48:19,609
Don't give me a lot of parlor socialism
that you learned in the Village.

910
00:48:20,818 --> 00:48:24,739
If you were mine, I wouldn't share you
with anybody or anything.

911
00:48:25,532 --> 00:48:29,077
It'd be just you and me.
You'd be at the center of it all.

912
00:48:31,746 --> 00:48:33,748
You know,
it would feel lot more like love

913
00:48:33,873 --> 00:48:36,167
than being left alone with your work.

914
00:48:48,513 --> 00:48:52,100
- I hope I haven't upset you.
- Not at all. I'm grateful.

915
00:48:52,684 --> 00:48:55,103
But you seem to be looking
for something much more serious

916
00:48:55,186 --> 00:48:57,146
than what I had in mind.

917
00:48:57,772 --> 00:48:59,858
- Than what you had in mind?
- Yes.

918
00:49:00,859 --> 00:49:04,279
You see, Jack and I
are both perfectly capable

919
00:49:04,404 --> 00:49:06,447
of living with our beliefs.

920
00:49:07,907 --> 00:49:10,827
But I think someone as romantic as you
would be destroyed by them.

921
00:49:11,744 --> 00:49:15,582
And I don't want that to happen.
It would upset Jack too much.

922
00:49:38,062 --> 00:49:40,481
You can't come and play in my yard

923
00:49:41,691 --> 00:49:44,152
I don't love you anymore

924
00:49:45,486 --> 00:49:47,697
You'll be sorry when you see me

925
00:49:48,615 --> 00:49:51,034
Sliding down my cellar door

926
00:49:52,243 --> 00:49:55,371
You can't holler down my rain barrel

927
00:49:55,747 --> 00:49:58,791
You can't climb my apple tree

928
00:50:00,919 --> 00:50:03,421
I don't want to play in your yard

929
00:50:04,255 --> 00:50:06,883
If you can't be good to me

930
00:50:40,959 --> 00:50:43,336
I don't want to play in your yard

931
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:46,047
I don't like you anymore

932
00:50:46,673 --> 00:50:48,925
You'll be sorry when you see me

933
00:50:49,634 --> 00:50:51,970
Sliding down our cellar door

934
00:50:53,179 --> 00:50:55,765
You can't holler down our rain barrel

935
00:50:56,182 --> 00:50:59,727
You can't climb our apple tree

936
00:51:00,019 --> 00:51:02,981
I don't want to play in your yard

937
00:51:03,481 --> 00:51:06,192
If you won't be good to me

938
00:51:09,571 --> 00:51:10,947
Wonderful!

939
00:51:28,131 --> 00:51:29,465
Floyd, I've been
waiting for this for weeks.

940
00:51:52,488 --> 00:51:54,199
Tap your sensuality.

941
00:52:10,131 --> 00:52:12,175
- Wonderful close.
- Extraordinary.

942
00:52:12,383 --> 00:52:14,177
Very good. Excellent.

943
00:52:16,513 --> 00:52:19,432
- Floyd, that's new for you, isn't it?
- Max, what about you?

944
00:52:19,557 --> 00:52:20,517
- Okay. Who's next?
- I just recited

945
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:21,893
two-thirds of my new play.

946
00:52:22,018 --> 00:52:24,229
You said it was a work
of uncanny perception.

947
00:52:24,354 --> 00:52:26,981
Oh, did I? How quickly we forget.

948
00:52:44,415 --> 00:52:46,459
- Well!
- Jack. Come in.

949
00:52:47,085 --> 00:52:48,711
News from the front.

950
00:52:48,795 --> 00:52:49,838
- Hello, Jack.
- Hello, Jack.

951
00:52:49,921 --> 00:52:51,422
- Hi, Jack.
- How was the trip?

952
00:52:53,716 --> 00:52:55,134
Welcome back.

953
00:52:55,593 --> 00:52:56,886
- Who's next?
- Nobody's next.

954
00:52:57,762 --> 00:52:59,556
Let's have a dance out of Gene.

955
00:52:59,639 --> 00:53:02,433
Jack, you're just in time
to see O'Neill dance.

956
00:53:03,601 --> 00:53:05,562
Okay. Do something Irish.
Come on, Gene.

957
00:53:05,687 --> 00:53:07,272
Yeah. Let's have it, Gene.

958
00:53:07,397 --> 00:53:09,732
- Yeah. Go ahead Gene.
- Recite something from your new play.

959
00:53:09,816 --> 00:53:11,150
Hutch says it's wonderful.

960
00:53:11,276 --> 00:53:13,778
Tell us about the convention, Jack.
How was Wilson's speech?

961
00:53:13,903 --> 00:53:16,698
Never mind the speech.
What was he wearing?

962
00:53:18,491 --> 00:53:21,619
- What about Wilson?
- Yeah. What about Wilson?

963
00:53:23,454 --> 00:53:26,791
Oh, I don't think there's any reason to
believe that Wilson's gonna do anything

964
00:53:26,916 --> 00:53:30,753
other than support the interest of the
ruling class and take us into the war.

965
00:53:30,837 --> 00:53:34,132
But as long as he says he's against it,
then I think we have to support him.

966
00:53:34,257 --> 00:53:37,385
Because he'll have to make good on
that campaign promise

967
00:53:37,468 --> 00:53:39,512
for at least a few months
and that might give us time

968
00:53:39,637 --> 00:53:41,139
to strengthen the anti-war coalition.

969
00:53:41,264 --> 00:53:44,225
But there's a lot more pro-war feeling in
the streets now than there was before...

970
00:54:00,366 --> 00:54:02,535
You want another drink, Gene?

971
00:54:07,207 --> 00:54:08,583
I guess not.

972
00:54:23,139 --> 00:54:25,308
- Good night.
- Night.

973
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:28,436
Good night.

974
00:54:39,030 --> 00:54:41,157
Would you like
some cold tea with lemon?

975
00:54:41,282 --> 00:54:42,617
No, thanks.

976
00:54:43,701 --> 00:54:45,495
Well, I'll have some, anyway.

977
00:54:58,716 --> 00:55:01,010
- What's this?
- A poem.

978
00:55:01,886 --> 00:55:03,388
May I read it?

979
00:55:07,392 --> 00:55:09,102
I didn't finish it.

980
00:55:26,202 --> 00:55:27,495
Finish it.

981
00:55:33,793 --> 00:55:35,086
Finish it?

982
00:55:38,965 --> 00:55:42,510
Would that make you happy?
If I were a poet?

983
00:55:45,263 --> 00:55:46,556
I'm happy.

984
00:55:57,108 --> 00:55:59,444
- Jack.
- Why don't you get some sleep?

985
00:56:00,737 --> 00:56:01,821
Jack.

986
00:56:04,407 --> 00:56:06,576
There's something
that I have to tell you.

987
00:56:06,951 --> 00:56:09,704
- You don't have to tell me anything.
- No?

988
00:56:10,788 --> 00:56:11,748
No.

989
00:56:21,299 --> 00:56:23,259
You want to get married?

990
00:56:54,290 --> 00:56:56,042
Okay. There we go. I'll see...

991
00:57:00,213 --> 00:57:03,842
- Oh, careful there. Careful.
- There's two more to come.

992
00:57:04,050 --> 00:57:06,511
Two? No, there should be three.

993
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:14,519
Oh, excuse me. I'm sorry.
I'm very sorry to hover like this.

994
00:57:14,644 --> 00:57:16,354
It's not that
you're not doing a wonderful job.

995
00:57:16,479 --> 00:57:19,607
It's just that I'm very concerned
about this one particular box.

996
00:57:21,943 --> 00:57:24,028
- Here. No. No.
- I'll take it.

997
00:57:46,426 --> 00:57:48,178
Where's the whiskey?

998
00:57:49,012 --> 00:57:51,973
- Lady, where do you want this?
- Oh, just put it over there.

999
00:57:52,056 --> 00:57:53,850
That'll be fine. Thank you.

1000
00:57:56,394 --> 00:57:57,437
Yeah.

1001
00:57:59,397 --> 00:58:01,691
- Anything to drink in there?
- Drink?

1002
00:58:01,983 --> 00:58:04,777
Oh, here. Thanks.
Thank you very much. I...

1003
00:58:04,903 --> 00:58:07,030
- Thank you. Good.
- Thank you.

1004
00:58:14,454 --> 00:58:19,584
Oh. Well. Let's see now. Here we are.

1005
00:58:22,504 --> 00:58:25,298
- Gene?
- No glass?

1006
00:58:25,423 --> 00:58:27,258
Oh. Let's see.

1007
00:58:28,551 --> 00:58:31,846
Well, I guess I should have
labeled these, shouldn't I have?

1008
00:58:33,515 --> 00:58:35,683
No. No, that isn't the right one.

1009
00:58:36,434 --> 00:58:37,852
Try this one.

1010
00:58:38,895 --> 00:58:41,397
Well, what are you working on, Gene?

1011
00:58:41,898 --> 00:58:43,775
At the moment, Scotch.

1012
00:58:43,942 --> 00:58:46,569
I found a cup. Will a cup be all right?

1013
00:58:46,694 --> 00:58:49,197
- I'd prefer a glass.
- A glass.

1014
00:58:51,241 --> 00:58:55,328
You know,
you left without saying goodbye.

1015
00:58:55,828 --> 00:58:59,624
That's not like you, not that I have
slightest idea what you're like.

1016
00:59:00,166 --> 00:59:02,627
Success at last. See, a... Here we go.

1017
00:59:14,138 --> 00:59:16,933
Your skill as a bartender
seems to have deteriorated.

1018
00:59:17,016 --> 00:59:20,019
- Are you nervous?
- Yes. No. I'm...

1019
00:59:20,270 --> 00:59:24,148
Why should I be nervous? My God,
it's gonna smell like a saloon in here.

1020
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:41,416
- What is it?
- It's a poem telling you that I love you.

1021
00:59:42,417 --> 00:59:45,628
And that I won't be possessive
and I won't be jealous.

1022
00:59:45,753 --> 00:59:49,716
And you can sleep with whoever
you want, live with whoever you want.

1023
00:59:50,008 --> 00:59:54,095
I'll do anything that you say.
I'd like to kill you, but I can't.

1024
00:59:55,972 --> 00:59:58,433
So you can do whatever you want to,

1025
00:59:59,726 --> 01:00:01,352
except not see me.

1026
01:00:03,813 --> 01:00:06,441
Or smoke during the monologue.

1027
01:00:10,945 --> 01:00:13,865
Gene, Jack and I,
we haven't told anyone yet

1028
01:00:13,990 --> 01:00:16,284
because we were too embarrassed.

1029
01:00:17,327 --> 01:00:18,453
But

1030
01:00:20,205 --> 01:00:21,664
we're married.

1031
01:00:22,123 --> 01:00:24,042
Jack and I got married.

1032
01:00:27,712 --> 01:00:31,216
- That is embarrassing.
- Yes. Isn't it?

1033
01:00:31,341 --> 01:00:33,843
We felt very silly, but we wanted to do it.

1034
01:00:33,968 --> 01:00:36,179
And it's gonna be good.
We're gonna work together.

1035
01:00:36,262 --> 01:00:38,014
We're gonna spend
all our time together.

1036
01:00:38,097 --> 01:00:39,766
That's why we took a lease
on this place,

1037
01:00:39,891 --> 01:00:41,476
so we wouldn't have to go back
to the city.

1038
01:00:41,559 --> 01:00:42,894
Does this mean that we have to cheat?

1039
01:00:43,019 --> 01:00:44,979
Or is this a free
and independent marriage?

1040
01:00:45,063 --> 01:00:47,398
- Gene.
- You're a lying Irish whore from Portland

1041
01:00:47,524 --> 01:00:50,235
and you used me
to get Jack Reed to marry you.

1042
01:00:50,735 --> 01:00:52,153
No, I didn't.

1043
01:00:52,904 --> 01:00:54,989
I just want us to be friends, Gene.

1044
01:00:55,073 --> 01:00:57,825
Oh, how genteel. That would be a
good role for you, wouldn't it?

1045
01:00:57,909 --> 01:01:00,411
"There's Louise with Jack and Gene.

1046
01:01:00,912 --> 01:01:03,498
"He's crazy about her,
but Jack doesn't know.

1047
01:01:03,581 --> 01:01:08,211
"Poor Jack. Poor Gene.
What a heartbreaker she is."

1048
01:01:13,466 --> 01:01:15,969
What a heartbreaker you are, Louise.

1049
01:01:17,428 --> 01:01:19,013
I'm sorry. I'm...

1050
01:01:21,516 --> 01:01:22,892
Where is he?

1051
01:01:25,436 --> 01:01:26,771
Washington.

1052
01:01:26,938 --> 01:01:28,565
Well, Mrs. Reed,

1053
01:01:29,732 --> 01:01:33,403
I'll do whatever you say.
What do you want me to do?

1054
01:01:35,655 --> 01:01:37,115
Wish us well?

1055
01:01:49,043 --> 01:01:50,587
I wish you well.

1056
01:01:52,714 --> 01:01:54,132
You and Jack.

1057
01:02:32,170 --> 01:02:33,213
Jack!

1058
01:02:35,131 --> 01:02:36,299
Oh, God.

1059
01:02:39,385 --> 01:02:42,055
I'm not sure whether she had an affair

1060
01:02:42,680 --> 01:02:45,350
with Eugene O'Neill or not
during this time.

1061
01:02:45,934 --> 01:02:48,228
And nobody seemed to know. Or...

1062
01:02:48,686 --> 01:02:51,314
It was nobody's business, anyway, so...

1063
01:02:52,190 --> 01:02:54,651
I don't know what that situation was.

1064
01:02:54,859 --> 01:02:58,321
The report was that
she and Reed and O'Neill

1065
01:02:58,446 --> 01:03:00,615
had a mnage  trois.

1066
01:03:03,868 --> 01:03:06,996
Jack, what... What is...

1067
01:03:22,095 --> 01:03:23,805
Oh, God! I swear...

1068
01:03:24,222 --> 01:03:27,100
...that we love America!

1069
01:03:27,892 --> 01:03:30,728
We love her mountains, her forests...

1070
01:03:30,854 --> 01:03:33,106
There were mutinies
in the French army,

1071
01:03:33,231 --> 01:03:36,109
there were mutinies
in various parts of the front.

1072
01:03:36,234 --> 01:03:40,280
And then, in 1917, the troops,
poorly armed,

1073
01:03:40,780 --> 01:03:43,950
poorly equipped, poorly clothed,
went back to Russia

1074
01:03:44,158 --> 01:03:45,451
to talk it out with the czar.

1075
01:03:45,577 --> 01:03:47,203
And when they got through,
there wasn't any czar.

1076
01:03:47,453 --> 01:03:49,205
Revolution in Russia.

1077
01:03:49,539 --> 01:03:52,417
This was the spring of 1917.

1078
01:03:53,334 --> 01:03:55,211
And I became so excited

1079
01:03:55,670 --> 01:03:59,174
that I zigzag-jumped the benches

1080
01:03:59,841 --> 01:04:02,010
as we walked out of the park.

1081
01:04:02,177 --> 01:04:04,888
Oh, I was so happy as a young boy.

1082
01:04:04,971 --> 01:04:07,348
Revolution, the people take over,

1083
01:04:08,224 --> 01:04:09,559
down with the czar!

1084
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:12,687
Naturally, I was happy.

1085
01:04:55,980 --> 01:04:58,983
Well, haven't you made the politics
a little nebulous here?

1086
01:04:59,108 --> 01:05:01,027
- What do you mean "nebulous"?
- Unclear...

1087
01:05:01,152 --> 01:05:03,988
- How can you say they're unclear?
- Well, they're unclear to me. I...

1088
01:05:04,113 --> 01:05:05,365
Why am I necessarily attempting

1089
01:05:05,490 --> 01:05:07,659
to define the politics
of a specific group of people?

1090
01:05:07,784 --> 01:05:11,162
It isn't what I said.
I think it's a vast oversimplification.

1091
01:05:13,289 --> 01:05:15,291
Oh, it's just an opinion.

1092
01:05:18,837 --> 01:05:21,339
You know,
if you made carbons of these,

1093
01:05:21,422 --> 01:05:23,550
I could take them on the train with me.

1094
01:05:24,008 --> 01:05:26,469
Wilson, of course,
was elected on the platform of

1095
01:05:26,553 --> 01:05:29,180
"Keep us out of war" in 1916.

1096
01:05:29,681 --> 01:05:33,518
But in 1917, Wilson reversed himself

1097
01:05:33,893 --> 01:05:37,146
and declared war against Germany.

1098
01:05:37,313 --> 01:05:40,650
The mission at that time was to make
the world safe for democracy.

1099
01:05:41,359 --> 01:05:42,652
Reed said,

1100
01:05:44,195 --> 01:05:48,908
"This is a war for democracy?
Where is the goddamn democracy?"

1101
01:05:49,534 --> 01:05:54,330
If men really disapproved of war, dear,
we'd have stopped wars years ago.

1102
01:05:55,748 --> 01:05:57,917
Men like wars. Always have.

1103
01:05:59,460 --> 01:06:02,505
So they all went and got little uniforms,
went to war.

1104
01:06:03,006 --> 01:06:05,466
- My country is at war!
- Yes.

1105
01:06:05,717 --> 01:06:09,596
And so today, I, too, am at war!

1106
01:06:11,681 --> 01:06:14,475
My name is Jack Reed,
I'm from New York.

1107
01:06:14,851 --> 01:06:17,770
This is not my war, and I'm not gonna
have anything to do with it!

1108
01:06:18,021 --> 01:06:19,397
All right. All right.

1109
01:06:19,898 --> 01:06:20,940
All right, folks.

1110
01:06:21,065 --> 01:06:23,568
There was a lot of anti-war feeling,
of course.

1111
01:06:23,651 --> 01:06:27,113
We had no one against the war.
There wasn't a soul against the war.

1112
01:06:27,822 --> 01:06:31,743
Well, I'm not talking about saying it
to the workers any other way.

1113
01:06:32,327 --> 01:06:34,871
How do we move them?

1114
01:06:34,996 --> 01:06:36,915
Right. How do we organize them?

1115
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:39,209
The Socialist Party...

1116
01:06:42,795 --> 01:06:45,048
The Socialist Party of America
is nothing to sneeze at.

1117
01:06:45,131 --> 01:06:47,884
You think the Socialist Party
is going to take a position?

1118
01:06:47,967 --> 01:06:49,469
You boys are Reds, aren't you?

1119
01:06:49,594 --> 01:06:53,223
The Socialist Party is useless.
Jack, is that right?

1120
01:06:53,431 --> 01:06:55,558
Now, that's the truth. Jack?

1121
01:06:55,975 --> 01:06:57,060
The United States is at war.

1122
01:06:57,143 --> 01:06:58,895
Your friends are talking to you.

1123
01:06:59,020 --> 01:07:02,440
If the workers of the world act together,
they can stop the war. And I'm not...

1124
01:07:02,524 --> 01:07:04,234
This one even pisses red.

1125
01:07:06,236 --> 01:07:08,821
You ran around saving the world
until your kidney acted up again.

1126
01:07:08,947 --> 01:07:10,114
Very intelligent.

1127
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:12,158
And you're gonna keep running around
making speeches

1128
01:07:12,283 --> 01:07:13,993
until you wind up
in the hospital. Brilliant.

1129
01:07:14,118 --> 01:07:15,912
And then,
you're gonna lose your kidney. Perfect.

1130
01:07:15,995 --> 01:07:18,289
Harry, how much is the government
paying you to keep me quiet?

1131
01:07:18,414 --> 01:07:19,624
- Very funny. Keep laughing.
- Yeah.

1132
01:07:19,749 --> 01:07:21,918
That hurt, didn't it?

1133
01:07:23,127 --> 01:07:25,129
Listen, I'm gonna tell you something.

1134
01:07:25,255 --> 01:07:27,924
You're not gonna be able to keep doing
what you've been doing.

1135
01:07:28,049 --> 01:07:29,968
This is a serious condition.
It could kill you.

1136
01:07:30,093 --> 01:07:33,429
Harry, look, I want to know if...

1137
01:07:34,222 --> 01:07:37,016
Could this thing interfere
with having children?

1138
01:07:37,141 --> 01:07:41,020
- Yes. You cannot have sex if you die.
- No, come on, Harry. Seriously.

1139
01:07:42,188 --> 01:07:44,858
Are you thinking about having children?

1140
01:07:45,608 --> 01:07:48,570
Not at the moment,
but I want to be able to...

1141
01:07:50,738 --> 01:07:52,782
Is Louise talking about it?

1142
01:07:53,992 --> 01:07:54,993
No.

1143
01:07:55,368 --> 01:07:57,245
Well, just because
she isn't talking about it

1144
01:07:57,328 --> 01:07:58,913
it doesn't mean
she isn't thinking about it.

1145
01:07:58,997 --> 01:08:01,291
Don't worry. You don't make babies
with your kidneys.

1146
01:08:01,374 --> 01:08:03,126
Look, I'm gonna send you home
to Louise.

1147
01:08:03,251 --> 01:08:04,919
Tell her to keep you there,
put you in bed,

1148
01:08:05,003 --> 01:08:07,463
give you lots of liquids.
I'm gonna write it all down.

1149
01:08:07,964 --> 01:08:10,925
Look, Louise doesn't know about
this. And I don't want her to, okay?

1150
01:08:11,050 --> 01:08:12,760
- Fine.
- So, can you give me my bill here?

1151
01:08:12,844 --> 01:08:15,638
- I don't want it sent to the house.
- Do you have any money?

1152
01:08:19,517 --> 01:08:20,560
Not at the moment.

1153
01:08:20,727 --> 01:08:23,146
Then why the hell
should I give you a bill? Go home.

1154
01:08:23,479 --> 01:08:26,983
It is my belief that socialism and peace
are inseparable.

1155
01:08:27,192 --> 01:08:31,029
And I reiterate that the Socialist Party
will stand firmly behind

1156
01:08:31,154 --> 01:08:34,407
its resolution to oppose
American involvement in this war!

1157
01:08:34,532 --> 01:08:36,868
Mr. Chairman, Louis Fraina,
Local Boston.

1158
01:08:36,993 --> 01:08:39,537
The chair recognizes
the delegate from Boston.

1159
01:08:39,662 --> 01:08:40,663
And I still want to know

1160
01:08:40,788 --> 01:08:43,583
what specific action
we are going to take against the war.

1161
01:08:43,708 --> 01:08:45,210
Your resolution is all very nice,

1162
01:08:45,335 --> 01:08:48,171
but will it stop even one boy from
being killed? I don't think so.

1163
01:08:48,254 --> 01:08:50,507
...stigmatized as unpatriotic.

1164
01:08:50,798 --> 01:08:52,884
The task that confronts us is difficult.

1165
01:08:53,009 --> 01:08:54,761
Let us hope
that we can handle it properly.

1166
01:08:54,886 --> 01:08:56,012
What's that supposed to mean?

1167
01:08:56,095 --> 01:08:57,263
Stupid!

1168
01:08:57,722 --> 01:09:01,601
I'd like to know if the Socialist Party
is gonna fight conscription or not.

1169
01:09:01,726 --> 01:09:04,562
- That's what I'd like to know.
- Will the delegate identify himself?

1170
01:09:04,687 --> 01:09:07,148
I am not a delegate, Mr. Chairman.
My name is John Reed,

1171
01:09:07,273 --> 01:09:08,733
I write for the magazine The Masses,

1172
01:09:08,816 --> 01:09:11,861
and I want to know if the Socialist Party
is gonna organize demonstrations...

1173
01:09:11,945 --> 01:09:14,030
I'm sorry, Mr. Reed.
You have no credentials here.

1174
01:09:14,113 --> 01:09:17,200
Now, this floor is reserved
for delegates, not journalists.

1175
01:09:17,283 --> 01:09:19,035
Mr. Chairman,
is the Socialist Party prepared

1176
01:09:19,118 --> 01:09:20,787
- to take a position on the draft or not?
- Hey, shut up!

1177
01:09:20,912 --> 01:09:23,206
I'm sorry, Mr. Reed.
You have no credentials.

1178
01:09:23,289 --> 01:09:24,415
Let him speak, will you?

1179
01:09:24,541 --> 01:09:26,960
Mr. Reed,
you're getting into party politics, eh?

1180
01:09:27,085 --> 01:09:29,379
I'm just trying to be a journalist.
Mr. Chairman...

1181
01:09:29,462 --> 01:09:32,632
So is Trotsky.
Let us see what happens in Russia.

1182
01:09:32,757 --> 01:09:36,427
Why don't you join the Socialist Party?
We need good people like you.

1183
01:09:36,553 --> 01:09:38,555
Big things are happening in Russia.

1184
01:09:38,680 --> 01:09:42,100
As appalling as it may seem
to see socialists supporting bloodshed,

1185
01:09:42,225 --> 01:09:44,727
I can understand the necessity
of supporting one's government

1186
01:09:44,853 --> 01:09:46,145
during times of war.

1187
01:09:46,271 --> 01:09:49,023
The task that confronts us is a giant!

1188
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:52,527
In that,
we must continue our opposition!

1189
01:10:06,416 --> 01:10:09,836
- We have to give this dog a name.
- Well, she has a name.

1190
01:10:10,753 --> 01:10:12,589
What's the matter with her name?

1191
01:10:13,047 --> 01:10:16,259
- I can't find anything in this house.
- I'm not going to call a dog "Dog."

1192
01:10:16,342 --> 01:10:18,595
I suppose if she were a baby,
you'd wanna call her "Person."

1193
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:20,597
Not really.
I think I might wanna call her "Jack."

1194
01:10:20,680 --> 01:10:22,098
No. No. Bad.

1195
01:10:22,182 --> 01:10:23,766
See, now this is why
I can't find anything.

1196
01:10:23,892 --> 01:10:24,934
You put things anywhere.

1197
01:10:25,059 --> 01:10:26,477
Dog! Dog!

1198
01:10:26,644 --> 01:10:28,479
She's still not housebroken.

1199
01:10:28,605 --> 01:10:30,982
You got to grab her
when she squats like that,

1200
01:10:31,107 --> 01:10:33,735
and then take her outside. That's right.

1201
01:10:33,818 --> 01:10:36,613
And then when she goes,
you've got to give her a reward.

1202
01:10:36,821 --> 01:10:38,615
All right. Now, stay, Dog.

1203
01:10:38,698 --> 01:10:40,700
Are we having garlic for dinner, honey?

1204
01:10:40,825 --> 01:10:41,826
No, no, no.

1205
01:10:49,709 --> 01:10:52,795
Why? Why, do you think
I'm using too much garlic?

1206
01:10:53,505 --> 01:10:55,924
I thought I'd put a little in the sauce.

1207
01:10:56,007 --> 01:10:58,009
Garlic doesn't bother me.

1208
01:11:10,021 --> 01:11:13,566
- That's from Gene.
- Sorry. I didn't mean to read it.

1209
01:11:14,484 --> 01:11:16,236
I didn't realize what it was.

1210
01:11:23,535 --> 01:11:26,746
He gave it to me in October.
I haven't seen him since.

1211
01:11:26,871 --> 01:11:28,581
- You don't have to explain.
- I'm not explaining.

1212
01:11:28,706 --> 01:11:31,084
- I'm just telling you it's over.
- Louise, look.

1213
01:11:31,209 --> 01:11:32,877
I don't expect you to tell me
everything you do.

1214
01:11:33,002 --> 01:11:34,963
What about if you tell me something,
just tell me the truth?

1215
01:11:35,088 --> 01:11:36,881
- Jack, I haven't seen him.
- Don't do that, Louise.

1216
01:11:37,006 --> 01:11:39,926
Don't tell me that Gene gave you
a love poem six or seven months ago,

1217
01:11:40,051 --> 01:11:42,011
but you put it in a book
and you haven't seen him since.

1218
01:11:42,136 --> 01:11:43,680
I don't care
whether you've seen him or not.

1219
01:11:43,763 --> 01:11:45,223
- I just care about dishonesty.
- Oh, I see.

1220
01:11:45,348 --> 01:11:47,267
You don't care
that I had an affair with another man,

1221
01:11:47,392 --> 01:11:49,769
you just care about dishonesty?
Look who's being dishonest.

1222
01:11:49,894 --> 01:11:51,521
You care. You care so much,
you won't even talk about it.

1223
01:11:51,646 --> 01:11:53,356
- You won't even mention...
- Wanna talk? I'll talk about it.

1224
01:11:53,481 --> 01:11:54,524
You want to be honest about it?

1225
01:11:54,649 --> 01:11:55,859
If I didn't wanna be honest about it,

1226
01:11:55,942 --> 01:11:57,694
do you think I'd be silly enough
to leave a poem he gave me

1227
01:11:57,777 --> 01:11:59,779
lying around in the house
in a book of Walt Whitman?

1228
01:11:59,904 --> 01:12:00,947
Why not Whitman?

1229
01:12:01,072 --> 01:12:03,783
I'm sure Gene would feel right at home
in that company.

1230
01:12:03,908 --> 01:12:05,034
Oh, no. You don't care.

1231
01:12:05,118 --> 01:12:07,412
Why the hell should I care that
you slept with somebody else?

1232
01:12:07,537 --> 01:12:08,538
Do you think I haven't?

1233
01:12:08,663 --> 01:12:10,248
I don't think we have to report
to each other

1234
01:12:10,373 --> 01:12:13,168
every time we go to bed with somebody.
It doesn't mean anything.

1235
01:12:13,251 --> 01:12:14,544
It doesn't mean that I love you any less.

1236
01:12:14,669 --> 01:12:17,005
Do you love me any less
'cause you went to bed with Gene?

1237
01:12:21,384 --> 01:12:23,011
What difference does it make?

1238
01:12:23,094 --> 01:12:25,722
I just don't think we should lie about it.
That's all.

1239
01:12:26,347 --> 01:12:28,766
- Who?
- What do you mean, "Who?"

1240
01:12:29,267 --> 01:12:30,643
- Who was it?
- Who was what?

1241
01:12:31,978 --> 01:12:33,354
Who was it?

1242
01:12:33,938 --> 01:12:35,982
What do you want, a list?
It doesn't mean anything.

1243
01:12:47,076 --> 01:12:48,244
Louise.

1244
01:12:50,330 --> 01:12:51,497
Louise.

1245
01:12:57,962 --> 01:12:59,923
- What are you doing?
- I'm not sure.

1246
01:13:00,423 --> 01:13:02,467
- I wanna know where you're going.
- I don't want to talk about it.

1247
01:13:02,592 --> 01:13:04,928
- Well, I wanna talk about it.
- You said it all, Jack.

1248
01:13:05,053 --> 01:13:07,931
What? What did I say now
that we both haven't said 100 times?

1249
01:13:08,056 --> 01:13:09,474
Please forward my mail
to John K. Wheeler,

1250
01:13:09,599 --> 01:13:10,642
Wheeler Bell Syndicate.

1251
01:13:10,767 --> 01:13:13,144
I'll have someone pick up
the rest of my things in the morning.

1252
01:13:13,269 --> 01:13:15,230
Didn't we say that people had to give
each other freedom

1253
01:13:15,355 --> 01:13:17,440
- if they were gonna live together?
- We said a lot of things.

1254
01:13:17,565 --> 01:13:19,067
I thought
we weren't going to be possessive.

1255
01:13:19,192 --> 01:13:20,944
- I thought you loved me!
- Who says I don't?

1256
01:13:21,069 --> 01:13:23,029
You love yourself! Me, you fuck!

1257
01:13:23,821 --> 01:13:25,990
When you're not fucking other people,
that is!

1258
01:13:26,115 --> 01:13:29,911
Freedom? You mean I should just be
like you and not give a damn, is that...

1259
01:13:31,371 --> 01:13:34,082
Is that what fucking Gene means?
You don't give a damn about us?

1260
01:13:34,165 --> 01:13:37,377
I'm not packing my bag.
I wanna know where you're going.

1261
01:13:37,502 --> 01:13:39,379
- Get out of my...
- Where you going?

1262
01:13:39,504 --> 01:13:41,381
- Get out of my...
- You're not going...

1263
01:13:43,633 --> 01:13:46,553
Get away! Get out of my way.

1264
01:14:10,535 --> 01:14:13,162
- How many were there?
- Come on, Louise.

1265
01:14:15,206 --> 01:14:18,877
You don't know the first thing about
what living together means.

1266
01:14:26,426 --> 01:14:27,886
Go ahead. I know where you're going.

1267
01:14:27,969 --> 01:14:30,889
I thought you needed someone
to share your life with. But I was wrong.

1268
01:14:30,972 --> 01:14:32,640
As long as you get your two shots of
limelight every day.

1269
01:14:32,724 --> 01:14:34,267
You don't need a thing.

1270
01:14:41,566 --> 01:14:43,860
You go to hell! Both of you!

1271
01:15:10,845 --> 01:15:15,350
It could possibly have been
a matter of prestige, you know,

1272
01:15:15,934 --> 01:15:18,811
to say that you had an affair
with Louise Bryant.

1273
01:15:19,562 --> 01:15:21,356
I haven't been spared

1274
01:15:21,481 --> 01:15:25,735
the legends about men that are
supposed to have had affairs with me,

1275
01:15:26,194 --> 01:15:28,279
because I was known by name.

1276
01:15:29,697 --> 01:15:32,200
Affairs which never occurred at all.

1277
01:15:32,617 --> 01:15:35,245
It's very difficult to tell, you know.

1278
01:15:35,370 --> 01:15:38,289
Do you know there is nothing
more bewildering

1279
01:15:38,373 --> 01:15:41,209
than when you get a letter
from a loony who says,

1280
01:15:41,292 --> 01:15:43,628
"That marvelous week
we spent in Venice."

1281
01:15:43,753 --> 01:15:47,298
- Yeah.
- And it happens about every two years.

1282
01:15:47,423 --> 01:15:49,300
- Yes.
- It's most extraordinary.

1283
01:15:52,846 --> 01:15:57,475
One day, I was out walking
with my aunt in Portland.

1284
01:15:58,309 --> 01:16:01,437
And she was quite something.
She was six feet tall.

1285
01:16:02,105 --> 01:16:04,649
And I said to her,

1286
01:16:04,858 --> 01:16:08,319
"What is all this ado about Louise?

1287
01:16:08,611 --> 01:16:10,572
"What do you think of her, Aunt Belle?"

1288
01:16:11,155 --> 01:16:12,240
She said,

1289
01:16:12,323 --> 01:16:15,702
"Well, she had something
that just appeals."

1290
01:16:19,330 --> 01:16:20,874
That's my story.

1291
01:16:21,416 --> 01:16:23,376
- How you feeling?
- Oh, better.

1292
01:16:23,501 --> 01:16:25,211
- Here you are.
- Oh. Thanks, Harry.

1293
01:16:25,753 --> 01:16:26,963
Thanks.

1294
01:16:27,338 --> 01:16:29,257
Well, we got it out just in time.

1295
01:16:29,424 --> 01:16:32,552
But since God only knows what
condition the one you've got left is in,

1296
01:16:32,677 --> 01:16:33,720
you better treat it well.

1297
01:16:34,095 --> 01:16:37,056
That means, tell that goddamn Eastman
you got to be in bed by midnight.

1298
01:16:37,182 --> 01:16:40,476
If you get an infection now, that's it!
Absolutely no salt!

1299
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:42,604
"Dear Jack,
I'm relieved you're feeling so well again.

1300
01:16:42,687 --> 01:16:44,272
"I talked to a specialist here in Paris.

1301
01:16:44,355 --> 01:16:46,691
"And he said you can lead
a perfectly normal life.

1302
01:16:46,816 --> 01:16:48,401
"I hope you're not neglecting
your writing.

1303
01:16:48,526 --> 01:16:49,485
"Please don't spend your energy

1304
01:16:49,611 --> 01:16:51,154
"getting caught up in things
you can't afford."

1305
01:16:51,279 --> 01:16:52,780
"Dear Jack, I'm enclosing a piece
I've written

1306
01:16:52,864 --> 01:16:53,990
"on a volunteer ambulance driver

1307
01:16:54,115 --> 01:16:55,575
"from the New York City
Police Department.

1308
01:16:55,700 --> 01:16:58,328
"Also, please don't keep asking me
if you can come over here.

1309
01:16:58,411 --> 01:16:59,787
"It just makes me think you have no..."

1310
01:16:59,871 --> 01:17:01,956
"Dear Jack, yes,
Wheeler's very happy with my work.

1311
01:17:02,040 --> 01:17:04,792
"Life here is so hectic and exhilarating
that I don't have a minute..."

1312
01:17:04,876 --> 01:17:06,544
"Dear Jack, don't worry, I'm well.

1313
01:17:06,669 --> 01:17:09,881
"My only problem is keeping up with
Wheeler's demands for more stories."

1314
01:17:10,006 --> 01:17:12,342
"...serial newsletter under the heading,
'Letters from France.'

1315
01:17:12,425 --> 01:17:13,676
"Please don't mention this to anyone.

1316
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:15,220
"I promised Wheeler I wouldn't
say anything to you."

1317
01:17:15,470 --> 01:17:18,014
"Dear Jack, I feel I've really grown
through my work for Wheeler,

1318
01:17:18,139 --> 01:17:20,058
"and there's no reason to worry about
my being here alone."

1319
01:17:20,183 --> 01:17:22,352
Bolsheviks, Sandy. The Bolsheviks!

1320
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:24,604
Jesus Christ,
if the Bolsheviks get in, Sandy,

1321
01:17:24,729 --> 01:17:27,524
you can just bend right over
and kiss your ass goodbye.

1322
01:17:27,607 --> 01:17:29,651
Because they'll pull Russia
right out of the war.

1323
01:17:29,734 --> 01:17:32,028
Right off the Eastern Front.
They quit, that's all.

1324
01:17:32,111 --> 01:17:33,905
Pete, the Bolsheviks are small potatoes.

1325
01:17:34,030 --> 01:17:35,865
Russia isn't gonna get out of the war.

1326
01:17:35,949 --> 01:17:38,368
You want to walk down
the Champs-Elyses someday

1327
01:17:38,451 --> 01:17:41,579
and see 500,000 Krauts
come barreling out of Fouquet's?

1328
01:17:41,704 --> 01:17:44,624
You better hope that the Bolsheviks
are small potatoes.

1329
01:17:44,749 --> 01:17:47,460
Now, let's have another drink. Waiter!

1330
01:17:47,877 --> 01:17:49,838
Waiter, another round here.

1331
01:17:49,963 --> 01:17:52,090
Hey! Oh, God. It's Red Emma, Jr!

1332
01:17:52,215 --> 01:17:53,842
Hey, come over here!

1333
01:17:53,925 --> 01:17:56,427
Speak up, Pete, speak up.
They can't hear you in the next room.

1334
01:17:56,845 --> 01:17:58,137
- How are you, Jack?
- Good to see you.

1335
01:17:58,304 --> 01:18:01,015
God. You look 20 pounds lighter
since you lost that kidney.

1336
01:18:01,099 --> 01:18:03,184
- Oh, yeah?
- I bet you only piss about half as much.

1337
01:18:03,268 --> 01:18:05,395
Yeah, but twice as often. Sarsaparilla.

1338
01:18:05,603 --> 01:18:08,064
Jack, can the Bolsheviks
overthrow Kerensky?

1339
01:18:08,147 --> 01:18:10,859
Okay. Why don't you ask
an impartial observer?

1340
01:18:11,401 --> 01:18:14,904
Goddamn it, Jack. What the hell
you got against this war anyway?

1341
01:18:15,029 --> 01:18:18,241
Shit, why don't you bury the hatchet
with Wilson?

1342
01:18:18,366 --> 01:18:22,036
Get back into print so we can all read
some decent writing, you know.

1343
01:18:22,203 --> 01:18:25,248
- I'll drink to that.
- You'll drink to anything.

1344
01:18:25,373 --> 01:18:28,793
Well, that's right, too.
It's good to see you.

1345
01:18:28,918 --> 01:18:32,338
Jesus Christ. It's good to see you.
Goddamn, how's Louise?

1346
01:18:32,714 --> 01:18:34,257
Not so good.

1347
01:18:34,465 --> 01:18:36,259
- She's good.
- Tell her from me that I said

1348
01:18:36,384 --> 01:18:39,888
that John Wheeler wouldn't know
a story if it fell right on top of him.

1349
01:18:40,013 --> 01:18:42,307
I'll tell you.
Hey, Jack, what are you doing?

1350
01:18:42,432 --> 01:18:44,559
What the hell are you doing?
You're driving them crazy.

1351
01:18:44,642 --> 01:18:45,935
You realize that?

1352
01:18:46,102 --> 01:18:48,188
They think you're some kind
of goddamn German!

1353
01:18:48,605 --> 01:18:50,773
I love it! Goddamn, I love it!

1354
01:18:50,899 --> 01:18:52,442
Give them hell, Jack. Give them hell.

1355
01:18:52,567 --> 01:18:54,736
- Is that a sarsaparilla with ice?
- Yeah, thanks.

1356
01:18:54,986 --> 01:18:57,697
You bet your sweet patoosie,
that's sarsaparilla with ice.

1357
01:18:57,822 --> 01:19:00,867
Why wouldn't John Wheeler
know a story if it fell on him?

1358
01:19:00,992 --> 01:19:03,453
John Wheeler's a dumbbell, that's why.

1359
01:19:03,786 --> 01:19:04,871
No, he's all right.

1360
01:19:04,996 --> 01:19:07,415
I just hate to see Louise get hurt.
That's all.

1361
01:19:08,833 --> 01:19:09,918
What are you talking about?

1362
01:19:12,837 --> 01:19:14,297
Jesus Christ.

1363
01:19:15,548 --> 01:19:17,342
Don't tell her that I told you. All right?

1364
01:19:18,635 --> 01:19:20,094
Told me what?

1365
01:19:20,845 --> 01:19:23,681
Well, Ben Parsons told me
that Wheeler had to let her go

1366
01:19:23,806 --> 01:19:27,602
because she hadn't turned anything in
that he could use,

1367
01:19:27,727 --> 01:19:29,312
other than some story about a cop

1368
01:19:29,437 --> 01:19:33,149
that went over there to drive
a police department ambulance.

1369
01:19:34,025 --> 01:19:36,569
- He let her go?
- Fired her.

1370
01:19:40,698 --> 01:19:43,159
- When did you hear that?
- A couple of weeks ago.

1371
01:19:43,701 --> 01:19:46,371
No, it was a month.
More than a month and a half ago.

1372
01:19:47,121 --> 01:19:49,916
Oh, look, Jack,
Wheeler's a goddamn moron.

1373
01:19:50,041 --> 01:19:52,168
Tell her she shouldn't feel ashamed
about being fired.

1374
01:19:52,293 --> 01:19:54,337
- I'm gonna see you later, huh?
- Jack, what's the matter?

1375
01:19:54,462 --> 01:19:57,048
Hell, we've all been fired.
I've been fired.

1376
01:19:57,173 --> 01:19:58,132
Hell, I'll drink to it.

1377
01:19:58,716 --> 01:20:01,135
Imagine, 65 million

1378
01:20:02,053 --> 01:20:03,805
go to war. Right?

1379
01:20:04,097 --> 01:20:06,182
10 million die.

1380
01:20:06,599 --> 01:20:08,601
10 million become orphans.

1381
01:20:08,893 --> 01:20:13,147
20 million become maimed, crippled,
or wounded.

1382
01:20:14,065 --> 01:20:17,193
You had catastrophe in Europe.

1383
01:20:17,610 --> 01:20:20,196
You had a holocaust in Europe.

1384
01:20:20,864 --> 01:20:22,991
You had a desire for change.

1385
01:20:23,741 --> 01:20:24,868
Who can stop them

1386
01:20:24,951 --> 01:20:28,329
when there was
such a revolutionary sentiment? Huh?

1387
01:20:28,538 --> 01:20:29,706
Who could stop them?

1388
01:20:40,466 --> 01:20:43,178
You know, I think I'm gonna have to get
a new typewriter...

1389
01:20:46,264 --> 01:20:48,099
- What are you...
- What?

1390
01:20:51,311 --> 01:20:53,146
You look fine. Are you all right now?

1391
01:20:53,271 --> 01:20:56,316
Oh, God, yes.
Nobody needs two kidneys.

1392
01:20:56,774 --> 01:20:58,985
The second one's just for show.

1393
01:21:00,612 --> 01:21:02,655
Sorry, this isn't a very good time.

1394
01:21:07,285 --> 01:21:10,079
They're moving me
to another communications center.

1395
01:21:10,455 --> 01:21:13,583
So, I'm just not going to be able to
talk to you right now, Jack.

1396
01:21:13,666 --> 01:21:16,085
Could we just go out here a second?
Just for a second?

1397
01:21:16,544 --> 01:21:19,756
- Look, I'm on my way to Russia.
- Oh, really? Have you enlisted?

1398
01:21:19,839 --> 01:21:20,924
Very funny.

1399
01:21:21,007 --> 01:21:22,467
I know you're doing work here
that's good,

1400
01:21:22,592 --> 01:21:24,886
'cause I read the ambulance piece
and I thought that was good.

1401
01:21:24,969 --> 01:21:26,346
- Thank you.
- And I know you're working on your book

1402
01:21:26,471 --> 01:21:27,805
and I know how important that is to you.

1403
01:21:27,931 --> 01:21:29,098
But you got to have enough sense

1404
01:21:29,224 --> 01:21:31,100
if you're trying to build up
your reputation as a journalist,

1405
01:21:31,184 --> 01:21:32,727
to be in the right place at the right time.

1406
01:21:32,810 --> 01:21:35,313
- I appreciate your advice.
- Well, the place to be now is Russia.

1407
01:21:35,396 --> 01:21:38,441
- Thank you. I'll remember that.
- Louise, it's chaos. They can't last.

1408
01:21:38,566 --> 01:21:40,818
They're in their third
provisional government in six months.

1409
01:21:40,944 --> 01:21:43,780
You know what that means? It means
there might be another revolution.

1410
01:21:43,863 --> 01:21:47,325
The workers are deserting the factories,
the army's deserting the battlefronts.

1411
01:21:47,408 --> 01:21:51,120
The exiles are all coming back.
The Jews, the anarchists, the socialists.

1412
01:21:51,204 --> 01:21:52,956
All of them are going back,
only this time

1413
01:21:53,122 --> 01:21:54,207
it might be the real thing.

1414
01:21:54,332 --> 01:21:56,459
And if they have
a real workers' revolution in Russia,

1415
01:21:56,584 --> 01:21:58,878
they'd have one in Germany,
and if they had one in Germany,

1416
01:21:59,003 --> 01:22:01,464
- it could happen all over the world.
- Got a match?

1417
01:22:01,548 --> 01:22:03,466
Louise, that'd be the end of the war.

1418
01:22:03,550 --> 01:22:05,260
You don't have to tell me
what's happening in Russia.

1419
01:22:05,343 --> 01:22:07,053
- I read the papers.
- Well, come with me.

1420
01:22:07,178 --> 01:22:09,138
As a colleague,
I'm not talking about anything else.

1421
01:22:09,305 --> 01:22:11,516
Come with me as a colleague.
You ought to be in Petrograd.

1422
01:22:11,641 --> 01:22:13,601
Oh, yeah? Well, that's what you said
about New York!

1423
01:22:13,685 --> 01:22:15,603
- I was right about New York.
- No, I have work I'm doing here.

1424
01:22:15,687 --> 01:22:16,729
And I happen to think my work is...

1425
01:22:16,855 --> 01:22:19,482
It is important. But it's not important as
what you could be doing in Russia.

1426
01:22:19,607 --> 01:22:21,609
I wanna work together. As partners.

1427
01:22:21,734 --> 01:22:24,445
I don't want a partner. And if
I wanted to go to Russia, I'd go alone.

1428
01:22:24,529 --> 01:22:26,322
- I wouldn't need you to take me.
- Louise.

1429
01:22:26,447 --> 01:22:29,367
Russia is not the safest place
in the world for a woman to be alone.

1430
01:22:29,492 --> 01:22:32,370
You may be a hell of a journalist.
But that doesn't mean...

1431
01:22:36,541 --> 01:22:38,751
Louise, we'd better hurry along.

1432
01:22:41,254 --> 01:22:43,006
So, moving you out of here, huh?

1433
01:22:43,131 --> 01:22:45,550
Yes. I've been promised an interview
with General Plumer.

1434
01:22:45,675 --> 01:22:47,844
Well, I've got to run along myself.

1435
01:22:49,053 --> 01:22:51,848
- Sorry I don't have any time.
- No. I don't want to keep you.

1436
01:22:51,931 --> 01:22:54,142
I just...
Look, the seat's already reserved.

1437
01:22:54,309 --> 01:22:56,519
You've wasted your money, Jack.
I don't want it.

1438
01:22:56,603 --> 01:23:00,064
Change the date. Go by yourself.
You can use it whenever you want to.

1439
01:23:00,565 --> 01:23:02,108
Keep up the good work.

1440
01:23:03,902 --> 01:23:05,028
Jack.

1441
01:23:06,905 --> 01:23:08,198
Good luck.

1442
01:23:08,281 --> 01:23:09,365
Yeah, you, too.

1443
01:23:15,538 --> 01:23:17,373
I got a taxi waiting.

1444
01:23:43,608 --> 01:23:45,318
Jack! Jack Reed!

1445
01:23:46,027 --> 01:23:47,946
- Joe, Joe Volski.
- How are you?

1446
01:23:48,071 --> 01:23:51,157
Oh, fine, fine.
Are you going to Petrograd, too?

1447
01:23:51,449 --> 01:23:53,910
- Yes. Yeah.
- Fine. Wonderful!

1448
01:23:53,993 --> 01:23:57,622
Great things are happening.
Are you traveling by yourself?

1449
01:23:59,374 --> 01:24:02,252
- I think I am.
- Well, then I'll switch.

1450
01:24:22,814 --> 01:24:24,440
We met in Chicago.

1451
01:24:25,900 --> 01:24:28,570
Boy, oh, boy. Were you a speaker!

1452
01:24:29,988 --> 01:24:31,948
You don't remember me, eh?

1453
01:24:33,616 --> 01:24:35,410
Well, it's not that.

1454
01:24:36,911 --> 01:24:39,455
- Maybe I just... Maybe it's the hat.
- My hat?

1455
01:24:39,581 --> 01:24:42,292
Yeah. Maybe I just don't recognize you
in this particular hat.

1456
01:24:42,417 --> 01:24:46,004
Oh, then I'm a revolutionary
returning in disguise.

1457
01:24:46,129 --> 01:24:49,382
Well, comes the revolution,
I'll buy you a new hat.

1458
01:24:49,507 --> 01:24:52,468
- I see you're studying Russian.
- Yeah. I'm trying to.

1459
01:24:52,594 --> 01:24:53,803
Know what?

1460
01:24:56,431 --> 01:24:57,515
- What?
- I mean,

1461
01:24:57,640 --> 01:24:59,976
ask me anything you want in Russian.

1462
01:25:00,059 --> 01:25:02,228
Thank you. I'll keep that in mind.

1463
01:25:03,062 --> 01:25:04,439
Let's see...

1464
01:25:04,689 --> 01:25:07,192
Excuse me.
Excuse me, now here's the thing.

1465
01:25:07,317 --> 01:25:10,653
I'd be a goddamned fool not to take you
up on this offer. So, here's what I want.

1466
01:25:10,737 --> 01:25:12,447
I want to sign my own name
to my own stories

1467
01:25:12,530 --> 01:25:14,115
and I don't want to use a double byline.

1468
01:25:14,199 --> 01:25:17,076
I want to be responsible
for my own time and my own actions.

1469
01:25:17,202 --> 01:25:19,621
I want to be referred to as Miss Bryant,
and not as Mrs. Reed,

1470
01:25:19,704 --> 01:25:21,706
and I want to keep an account
of every cent we spend

1471
01:25:21,789 --> 01:25:22,916
so that I can pay you back.

1472
01:25:23,041 --> 01:25:25,251
Now, I assume you know that
I'm not going to sleep with you,

1473
01:25:25,376 --> 01:25:28,046
so just don't confuse the issue
by bringing it up.

1474
01:25:28,171 --> 01:25:29,255
That's it.

1475
01:25:30,381 --> 01:25:31,799
- Fine.
- Good.

1476
01:25:32,133 --> 01:25:33,384
You like salami?

1477
01:25:37,347 --> 01:25:39,557
He says,
"Wait a minute, I have to go back.

1478
01:25:39,682 --> 01:25:41,684
"I forgot my teeth on the table."

1479
01:25:41,976 --> 01:25:43,811
He says, "Hell with your teeth!

1480
01:25:43,895 --> 01:25:46,898
"What do you think,
they're bombarding with sandwiches?"

1481
01:26:00,245 --> 01:26:02,872
After the revolution,
you'll buy me a new hat.

1482
01:26:02,956 --> 01:26:05,542
Thank you very much.
I'll keep you by your word.

1483
01:26:06,543 --> 01:26:09,254
By the way, did you hear this one?
A man...

1484
01:26:27,522 --> 01:26:30,316
Lenin asks,
"Why do you let your beard grow?"

1485
01:26:30,441 --> 01:26:33,570
I says, "I want to remember
what I ate yesterday."

1486
01:26:41,452 --> 01:26:44,747
This is a hard word,
but it means "I don't smoke."

1487
01:26:44,873 --> 01:26:45,915
Okay.

1488
01:26:48,626 --> 01:26:51,796
"Are you one of the family?"
He said, "No. That's why I'm crying."

1489
01:26:58,469 --> 01:27:01,264
There's a foreman of a logging camp,
he's trying to hire a crew.

1490
01:27:01,389 --> 01:27:03,600
You know, and he goes down
a long line of very big men

1491
01:27:03,683 --> 01:27:04,767
and he gets to a little man in the back

1492
01:27:04,893 --> 01:27:06,811
and he says, "Who the hell are you?
What're you doing here?

1493
01:27:06,936 --> 01:27:09,772
"Don't you know that I need men who
can chop down dozens of trees a day?

1494
01:27:09,898 --> 01:27:11,441
"Where the hell
have you ever worked before?"

1495
01:27:11,566 --> 01:27:13,902
And the little man says,
"Well, I worked in the Sahara forest."

1496
01:27:13,985 --> 01:27:15,695
And the foreman says,
"You mean the Sahara Desert."

1497
01:27:15,820 --> 01:27:18,114
And the little man says,
"Yes, sure, now!"

1498
01:27:21,951 --> 01:27:23,912
A woman knocks at the door
of her neighbor.

1499
01:27:24,037 --> 01:27:25,163
I didn't tell you that?

1500
01:27:25,288 --> 01:27:29,584
She says, "My husband just died.
I want to sell his jacket."

1501
01:27:30,752 --> 01:27:33,630
He says,
"What's the matter with the pants?"

1502
01:27:33,838 --> 01:27:35,965
She says, "The pants, I wear."

1503
01:27:43,890 --> 01:27:45,600
The Russian border.

1504
01:27:51,356 --> 01:27:53,066
The Russian border.

1505
01:28:18,216 --> 01:28:20,510
He's already fighting for three months.

1506
01:28:20,593 --> 01:28:24,597
Now he joined the Bolsheviks
and he's not going to fight anymore.

1507
01:28:28,268 --> 01:28:32,105
I don't think he's afraid.
There are many Bolsheviks in the army.

1508
01:28:32,230 --> 01:28:34,357
And the Bolsheviks will stop the war.

1509
01:28:37,694 --> 01:28:39,362
He's 14 years old.

1510
01:29:11,477 --> 01:29:14,647
The Communists obviously wanted
peace. Rightly so.

1511
01:29:15,273 --> 01:29:18,401
Because the country was completely
unable to sustain a war.

1512
01:29:18,526 --> 01:29:21,112
There was treason
and there was corruption.

1513
01:29:21,237 --> 01:29:23,114
There was everything under the sun.

1514
01:29:23,239 --> 01:29:26,451
But certainly...
There was certainly no possibility

1515
01:29:26,576 --> 01:29:28,745
of conducting a war.

1516
01:29:28,912 --> 01:29:31,331
Kerensky was anxious to conduct it,

1517
01:29:31,456 --> 01:29:35,960
produce some battalions of women
who were going to go and fight.

1518
01:29:40,256 --> 01:29:41,591
Jack Reed!

1519
01:29:43,551 --> 01:29:45,762
Alex, what the hell are you doing here?

1520
01:29:45,887 --> 01:29:47,639
- You have someone to meet you?
- No.

1521
01:29:47,764 --> 01:29:49,557
Then what luck I am here!

1522
01:29:50,475 --> 01:29:51,559
- Lois?
- Yes.

1523
01:29:51,643 --> 01:29:52,727
Alex Gomberg.

1524
01:29:52,810 --> 01:29:55,438
- Looking for accommodation?
- No. Just a hotel.

1525
01:29:55,605 --> 01:29:58,149
More good luck.
I know of an empty apartment.

1526
01:29:58,274 --> 01:30:01,402
You have transportation?
No problem. Follow me.

1527
01:30:02,320 --> 01:30:05,657
A lot of people had an idea
that Utopia was growing up.

1528
01:30:05,782 --> 01:30:08,826
I could not blame them
for being pro-Bolshevik,

1529
01:30:08,952 --> 01:30:10,370
but I wasn't.

1530
01:30:10,495 --> 01:30:13,122
The one person
who was awfully ignorant about Russia

1531
01:30:13,206 --> 01:30:15,124
- was Beatrice Webb.
- Yes, she was.

1532
01:30:15,250 --> 01:30:16,626
She didn't know a thing.

1533
01:30:16,835 --> 01:30:19,671
Do not be misled by the quiet
in the streets.

1534
01:30:19,796 --> 01:30:21,381
Underneath is great tension.

1535
01:30:22,257 --> 01:30:24,717
Alex, how much time
has the Kerensky government got left?

1536
01:30:24,843 --> 01:30:27,303
Any day now, the Bolsheviks will strike.

1537
01:30:32,350 --> 01:30:33,476
Fantastic, isn't it?

1538
01:30:33,560 --> 01:30:36,896
A quiet street,
and yet we are in the heart of Petrograd.

1539
01:30:38,523 --> 01:30:39,774
Give him four rubles.

1540
01:30:43,778 --> 01:30:46,364
Jack, Lois. Lucky for you, I am here.

1541
01:30:47,240 --> 01:30:50,577
Yeah. Thanks. Thanks again.

1542
01:30:54,205 --> 01:30:56,416
Only one bed? That's a double.

1543
01:30:57,250 --> 01:30:59,836
Single. That's a single!
This is where I'II...

1544
01:31:00,753 --> 01:31:02,839
This is good for me. I can just...

1545
01:31:04,424 --> 01:31:05,508
Good.

1546
01:31:11,181 --> 01:31:12,807
I don't mind this at all.

1547
01:31:25,153 --> 01:31:26,946
He's calling for an insurrection,
isn't he?

1548
01:31:27,071 --> 01:31:28,865
Day and night. Day and night.

1549
01:31:29,282 --> 01:31:31,201
"Another insurrection will ruin Russia."

1550
01:31:31,326 --> 01:31:32,869
"Another insurrection will save Russia."

1551
01:31:32,994 --> 01:31:34,704
"The war is ruining Russia."

1552
01:31:34,829 --> 01:31:38,166
"Without England or France,
Russia will be isolated."

1553
01:31:38,291 --> 01:31:40,084
"The Bolsheviks are ruining Russia."

1554
01:31:40,210 --> 01:31:42,504
Lois, lucky for you, I am here.

1555
01:31:42,629 --> 01:31:44,172
Louise.

1556
01:31:44,881 --> 01:31:46,716
- This is the line for bread.
- Yes.

1557
01:31:46,841 --> 01:31:48,927
There's another line for boots.

1558
01:31:49,052 --> 01:31:51,429
And there is still another line for cards

1559
01:31:51,554 --> 01:31:54,432
on which they'll get the boots
in two, three months.

1560
01:31:54,641 --> 01:31:58,228
Did we have to get rid of the czar
to stand in line for bread?

1561
01:31:59,771 --> 01:32:01,898
- What does that mean?
- I don't know.

1562
01:32:03,983 --> 01:32:07,070
Vosstanie means "Insurrection,"
and "Kerensky" means "Kerensky,"

1563
01:32:07,237 --> 01:32:08,905
and Bolsheviki means Bolshevik.

1564
01:32:09,155 --> 01:32:11,991
So I think it calls for an insurrection
by the Bolsheviks

1565
01:32:12,116 --> 01:32:14,577
against the Kerensky government
and the kornilovtsy.

1566
01:32:14,702 --> 01:32:16,704
- What's a kornilovtsy?
- Louise, I'm not that fluent in Russian.

1567
01:32:17,956 --> 01:32:21,751
Look, if they buy this,

1568
01:32:22,001 --> 01:32:24,462
they're gonna cut you down
to 400 or 500 words, aren't they?

1569
01:32:24,587 --> 01:32:27,966
- That starts out like you got 5,000.
- Where would you cut?

1570
01:32:29,884 --> 01:32:32,637
I'd lose this. I'd lose this.

1571
01:32:33,429 --> 01:32:35,223
But what's your lead?

1572
01:32:37,225 --> 01:32:39,602
Oh, I know what you think.
You think the strongman line.

1573
01:32:39,727 --> 01:32:42,105
Well, I just don't know if you're gonna
take anybody's breath away

1574
01:32:42,230 --> 01:32:45,108
with that for a lead. You know?

1575
01:32:47,318 --> 01:32:49,946
You're right.
It's too long, it's too general.

1576
01:32:50,071 --> 01:32:52,740
And the strongman line
is the best lead.

1577
01:32:56,327 --> 01:32:59,163
You've been right
about something else, too.

1578
01:33:01,541 --> 01:33:04,586
The Bolsheviks will take Russia
out of the war.

1579
01:33:07,088 --> 01:33:09,465
- Good night.
- Night.

1580
01:33:10,258 --> 01:33:12,552
"In the streets the talk
is of peace and bread.

1581
01:33:12,677 --> 01:33:14,137
"Neither of which
Kerensky has provided."

1582
01:33:14,220 --> 01:33:15,638
"Everybody knows that
something is going to happen,

1583
01:33:15,638 --> 01:33:16,097
"Everybody knows that
something is going to happen,

1584
01:33:16,222 --> 01:33:17,473
"but nobody knows just what."

1585
01:33:19,851 --> 01:33:20,852
Yes?

1586
01:33:20,977 --> 01:33:22,854
I'm sorry, I don't speak Russian.
I'm English.

1587
01:33:22,979 --> 01:33:24,314
"Petrograd does not sleep.

1588
01:33:24,397 --> 01:33:26,691
"At night, the arguments grow louder
and the crowds thicken."

1589
01:33:26,816 --> 01:33:28,234
"Nobody is satisfied with Kerensky.

1590
01:33:28,359 --> 01:33:30,987
"The far right wants a strongman,
the far left wants peace.

1591
01:33:31,070 --> 01:33:33,114
"Everyone waits to see
what the Bolsheviks will do."

1592
01:33:33,198 --> 01:33:35,992
"It is not easy to write fairly about
the Bolshevik leader Lenin.

1593
01:33:36,075 --> 01:33:38,661
"He is absorbed, cold,
impatient of interruptions."

1594
01:33:38,745 --> 01:33:41,289
- You're editorializing here.
- I never editorialize.

1595
01:33:41,372 --> 01:33:43,875
- At the end.
- You're right. Cut it.

1596
01:33:46,711 --> 01:33:48,546
What I don't understand is...

1597
01:33:49,047 --> 01:33:51,883
Why did you take out the piece
about the gunshot? It was very good.

1598
01:33:52,008 --> 01:33:53,134
- It is good, isn't it?
- Yeah.

1599
01:33:53,218 --> 01:33:54,844
Put it back in for me.

1600
01:34:01,559 --> 01:34:04,145
Mr. Zinoviev, do you still feel
that the timing is wrong

1601
01:34:04,229 --> 01:34:05,980
for a Bolshevik insurrection?

1602
01:34:06,064 --> 01:34:08,066
"I interviewed Zinoviev at Smolny.

1603
01:34:08,191 --> 01:34:09,442
"He'd been in hiding with Lenin."

1604
01:34:09,567 --> 01:34:12,153
...had another whole decade,
less than a day.

1605
01:34:12,237 --> 01:34:14,697
"His style is still that of a man in hiding.

1606
01:34:14,781 --> 01:34:16,491
"We hear Trotsky speak at Smolny.

1607
01:34:16,574 --> 01:34:18,952
"If Lenin represents thought,
Trotsky represents action.

1608
01:34:19,077 --> 01:34:20,119
"He is essentially an agitator."

1609
01:34:20,245 --> 01:34:21,704
"The meeting hall at Smolny
was packed. At one point,

1610
01:34:21,829 --> 01:34:24,123
"someone in the platform
asked the comrades not to smoke,

1611
01:34:24,249 --> 01:34:26,209
"and everybody, including the smokers
took up the cry,

1612
01:34:26,334 --> 01:34:28,419
"'Don't smoke, comrades! '
And then they went on smoking."

1613
01:34:28,545 --> 01:34:30,630
"At the point Trotsky said,
'We are trying to avoid insurrection,

1614
01:34:30,755 --> 01:34:32,465
"'but if the Kerensky government
attacks us,

1615
01:34:32,590 --> 01:34:33,716
"'we shall answer blow by blow,'

1616
01:34:33,800 --> 01:34:35,718
"the audience broke into wild cheers."

1617
01:34:35,802 --> 01:34:39,556
"Lenin is a strange popular leader,
a leader purely by virtue of intellect.

1618
01:34:39,639 --> 01:34:42,058
"Colorless, humorless,
uncompromising,

1619
01:34:42,141 --> 01:34:44,894
"he seems to have
none of Trotsky's force of personality

1620
01:34:45,019 --> 01:34:48,648
"or his gift for phrasemaking,
and yet it is Lenin who is the architect."

1621
01:34:49,691 --> 01:34:51,442
Kerensky is some socialist, huh?

1622
01:34:53,653 --> 01:34:56,322
"The Winter Palace of the czar, where
Kerensky's government holds office,

1623
01:34:56,447 --> 01:34:58,533
- "is vast and magnificent..."
- "It is quiet in the Winter Palace.

1624
01:34:58,616 --> 01:35:00,451
"There's no sign here
of the strikes and lockouts

1625
01:35:00,577 --> 01:35:02,412
"that convulse Moscow and Odessa.

1626
01:35:02,745 --> 01:35:04,706
"No evidence that
transportation is paralyzed,

1627
01:35:04,789 --> 01:35:07,375
"that the army is starving
and in the big cities, there is no bread."

1628
01:35:07,458 --> 01:35:10,378
"Kerensky is full of old-world manners
and charm, totally unlike Lenin."

1629
01:35:10,461 --> 01:35:12,964
"'Provisional government will last,'
Kerensky said during the interview,

1630
01:35:13,089 --> 01:35:14,591
"'in spite of the Bolsheviks.'"

1631
01:35:14,716 --> 01:35:16,843
"He seemed bitter, defensive."

1632
01:35:17,302 --> 01:35:20,096
900,000 men deserted
since January the 1st.

1633
01:35:20,680 --> 01:35:24,058
That's 14% of the Russian army. I...

1634
01:35:25,059 --> 01:35:28,605
I'm sort of braising the cabbage.
'Cause I thought it'd be a nice change.

1635
01:35:29,105 --> 01:35:32,358
You know that house
where Rhys Williams is staying?

1636
01:35:32,942 --> 01:35:36,154
Evidently, the banker's daughter
came home in hysterics the other night,

1637
01:35:36,279 --> 01:35:38,448
'cause some woman streetcar
conductor called her "comrade."

1638
01:35:39,782 --> 01:35:41,242
So after dinner, they all voted

1639
01:35:41,326 --> 01:35:44,120
they preferred the Germans
to the Bolsheviks by 10-to-one.

1640
01:35:44,204 --> 01:35:47,749
Anyway, the Social Revolutionaries
asked the British ambassador

1641
01:35:47,832 --> 01:35:48,958
to please not to mention their visit,

1642
01:35:49,083 --> 01:35:51,294
because they were already considered
too far to the right.

1643
01:35:51,419 --> 01:35:52,879
And you know,
it's the same group of people

1644
01:35:53,004 --> 01:35:55,632
you couldn't even see a year ago,
'cause they were too far to the left.

1645
01:35:55,757 --> 01:35:57,967
Karsavina is dancing tonight.

1646
01:35:58,051 --> 01:36:00,345
And, oh, Manny Komroff says
that Charlie Chaplin will be...

1647
01:36:00,470 --> 01:36:01,638
Jack...

1648
01:36:02,514 --> 01:36:04,641
Thanks for bringing me here.

1649
01:36:16,319 --> 01:36:17,904
Will they strike?

1650
01:36:19,572 --> 01:36:21,366
Do you speak English?

1651
01:36:23,535 --> 01:36:24,744
Do you speak English?

1652
01:36:24,869 --> 01:36:25,995
Do you speak English?

1653
01:36:28,665 --> 01:36:30,333
Do you speak English?

1654
01:36:30,416 --> 01:36:32,168
Do you speak English?

1655
01:36:32,418 --> 01:36:34,212
Do you speak English?

1656
01:36:34,337 --> 01:36:35,880
- Do you speak English?
- Yes.

1657
01:36:36,005 --> 01:36:37,632
Will they strike?

1658
01:36:42,011 --> 01:36:43,179
- New York?
- Yes.

1659
01:36:43,304 --> 01:36:44,889
- You know Broome Street?
- Yes!

1660
01:36:45,014 --> 01:36:46,641
I know,
but can you tell me what he's saying?

1661
01:36:46,724 --> 01:36:49,853
- I lived there four years.
- Really? What's he...

1662
01:36:50,270 --> 01:36:52,063
What is he saying?

1663
01:36:52,522 --> 01:36:54,399
Can you tell me what he's saying?

1664
01:36:54,524 --> 01:36:56,901
He says don't strike.
He says it's not right

1665
01:36:57,026 --> 01:36:59,571
to leave our Russian soldiers
at Front without guns.

1666
01:37:02,115 --> 01:37:04,492
You are a long way from New York.

1667
01:37:23,511 --> 01:37:26,222
He says that our Russian
soldiers at the Front

1668
01:37:26,347 --> 01:37:27,807
are also strike.

1669
01:37:27,932 --> 01:37:29,976
That is why they're leaving the Front.

1670
01:37:42,363 --> 01:37:43,364
What's that?

1671
01:37:43,448 --> 01:37:45,408
He said that the workers of England,
France and America

1672
01:37:45,491 --> 01:37:47,368
will be left alone to fight Germany.

1673
01:37:47,452 --> 01:37:48,661
Tell him he doesn't know
how many workers

1674
01:37:48,786 --> 01:37:50,747
in England, France and America
are against the war.

1675
01:37:50,872 --> 01:37:52,373
You lived in New York. Tell him that.

1676
01:37:52,457 --> 01:37:54,000
You are right, American.

1677
01:38:01,508 --> 01:38:02,926
Go ahead, you speak.

1678
01:38:06,137 --> 01:38:07,263
Go ahead.

1679
01:38:07,388 --> 01:38:09,182
Tell them about your American workers.

1680
01:38:09,307 --> 01:38:11,851
No, I can't speak here, I don't have
any credentials to speak here.

1681
01:38:11,976 --> 01:38:14,354
- I'm an American...
- Credentials? What credentials?

1682
01:38:14,479 --> 01:38:16,314
Everyone has credentials here.

1683
01:38:16,439 --> 01:38:17,732
He ask you to speak.

1684
01:38:19,817 --> 01:38:21,569
Speak. I translate.

1685
01:38:45,385 --> 01:38:47,303
I only want to say that if you strike,

1686
01:38:47,428 --> 01:38:50,014
the American workers
will not feel betrayed.

1687
01:38:56,521 --> 01:38:58,523
They're waiting for your example.

1688
01:38:59,858 --> 01:39:01,860
They're waiting for your leadership.

1689
01:39:01,985 --> 01:39:04,821
If you refuse to support
the capitalist war machine,

1690
01:39:04,904 --> 01:39:06,447
they will follow your example.

1691
01:39:06,531 --> 01:39:08,408
And if workers of the world
stand together,

1692
01:39:08,533 --> 01:39:10,285
the war can be stopped.

1693
01:39:17,375 --> 01:39:19,961
They support you
and will join you in revolution!

1694
01:43:55,990 --> 01:43:59,160
Then, comrades, come rally

1695
01:43:59,411 --> 01:44:02,414
And the last fight
Let us face

1696
01:44:02,831 --> 01:44:06,167
The Internationale

1697
01:44:06,292 --> 01:44:09,045
Unites the human race

1698
01:44:09,295 --> 01:44:12,257
Then, comrades, come rally

1699
01:44:12,340 --> 01:44:15,301
And the last fight
Let us face

1700
01:44:15,385 --> 01:44:18,138
The Internationale

1701
01:44:18,263 --> 01:44:21,683
Unites the human race

1702
01:44:21,808 --> 01:44:22,934
That's how it goes.

1703
01:44:23,476 --> 01:44:24,519
Porter!

1704
01:44:30,108 --> 01:44:31,568
Confiscate it.

1705
01:44:31,860 --> 01:44:34,237
I'll take it with me to Washington
on Wednesday.

1706
01:44:34,320 --> 01:44:36,031
On whose authority?

1707
01:44:36,823 --> 01:44:39,409
The authority of the Attorney General.

1708
01:44:40,035 --> 01:44:41,870
All right, pack it up.

1709
01:44:41,995 --> 01:44:45,540
- Attorney General?
- Attorney General of the United States.

1710
01:44:45,749 --> 01:44:47,459
That's upside down.

1711
01:44:48,960 --> 01:44:50,253
- Louise!
- Max!

1712
01:44:51,504 --> 01:44:52,881
How are you?

1713
01:44:54,174 --> 01:44:55,717
Max. Hi!

1714
01:44:57,969 --> 01:44:59,137
Hi!

1715
01:44:59,262 --> 01:45:02,015
Oh, God, Louise. You look good!

1716
01:45:02,140 --> 01:45:04,267
God, whatever you've been doing,
you ought to bottle it.

1717
01:45:04,351 --> 01:45:05,852
Oh, thank you.

1718
01:45:06,227 --> 01:45:09,064
He's gonna write a great book, Max,
and I'm gonna lecture while he's doing it

1719
01:45:09,189 --> 01:45:10,523
so we can have something to live on.

1720
01:45:10,648 --> 01:45:12,609
And he's gonna write
wherever I'm lecturing.

1721
01:45:12,692 --> 01:45:14,152
And then we're gonna go back to Croton

1722
01:45:14,235 --> 01:45:15,820
and he's gonna help me edit
my collection of articles

1723
01:45:15,904 --> 01:45:17,364
on women in the Revolution,

1724
01:45:17,489 --> 01:45:19,157
and then we're gonna help
edit each other's books.

1725
01:45:19,240 --> 01:45:21,701
No more separations.
We've really promised each other, Max.

1726
01:45:21,785 --> 01:45:24,162
We're really going to get down
to living our own lives.

1727
01:45:24,621 --> 01:45:27,540
It's so moving.
God, Max, you should've been there!

1728
01:45:27,916 --> 01:45:31,628
Well, they took my notes.
Every goddamn note I have for my book.

1729
01:45:31,711 --> 01:45:33,213
Can they do that?

1730
01:45:33,296 --> 01:45:36,007
Welcome home. Let's go.

1731
01:45:36,549 --> 01:45:38,218
Come on, come on.
We'll get your notes back.

1732
01:45:38,343 --> 01:45:39,719
You'll write your book.

1733
01:45:39,844 --> 01:45:42,347
A lot's been happening. Now what
the hell is going on here, Jack?

1734
01:45:42,430 --> 01:45:45,016
I understand you and Louise
have decided to be happy?

1735
01:45:45,141 --> 01:45:47,310
It's a very difficult situation

1736
01:45:47,394 --> 01:45:50,689
for a country who is conducting a war,

1737
01:45:50,980 --> 01:45:53,775
when one of its allies has a revolution

1738
01:45:53,900 --> 01:45:56,194
and the government is changed.

1739
01:45:56,277 --> 01:46:00,073
The thing that made the furor
was that the Russians withdrew,

1740
01:46:00,156 --> 01:46:02,075
and we lost an ally.

1741
01:46:02,492 --> 01:46:05,161
We thought the Russians
had gone back on us.

1742
01:46:05,578 --> 01:46:07,956
The Bolshevik Revolution, at the time,

1743
01:46:08,081 --> 01:46:11,543
was the most single striking
event in the history of the times,

1744
01:46:11,668 --> 01:46:12,711
of the whole era.

1745
01:46:12,836 --> 01:46:15,672
The complete transformation
of Russian society,

1746
01:46:15,755 --> 01:46:18,800
and the taking over
by the peasants and the workers

1747
01:46:19,092 --> 01:46:20,552
of the machinery of the state.

1748
01:46:20,635 --> 01:46:22,387
It never had happened before in history.

1749
01:46:22,804 --> 01:46:24,431
You're a grand old flag

1750
01:46:24,556 --> 01:46:26,307
You're a high flying flag

1751
01:46:26,433 --> 01:46:28,727
And forever and e'er may you wave

1752
01:46:29,102 --> 01:46:32,272
You're the emblem of
The land I love

1753
01:46:32,397 --> 01:46:34,649
The home of the free and the brave

1754
01:46:34,816 --> 01:46:37,902
Every heart beats true
For the red, white and blue

1755
01:46:37,986 --> 01:46:40,572
Where there's never a boast or brag

1756
01:46:40,989 --> 01:46:43,825
Should auld acquaintance be forgot

1757
01:46:43,950 --> 01:46:46,369
Keep your eye on the grand old flag

1758
01:46:47,287 --> 01:46:49,414
Over There is not till 1918.

1759
01:46:50,081 --> 01:46:51,875
Over there, over there

1760
01:46:51,958 --> 01:46:53,585
Send the word, send the word

1761
01:46:53,668 --> 01:46:56,046
Over there
That the Yanks are coming...

1762
01:46:56,129 --> 01:46:57,255
You know that one.

1763
01:46:57,380 --> 01:47:00,800
But the other one
after Grand Old Flag,

1764
01:47:01,134 --> 01:47:04,346
or before, was
I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy.

1765
01:47:05,889 --> 01:47:07,974
I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy

1766
01:47:08,433 --> 01:47:10,018
Yankee Doodle...

1767
01:47:10,143 --> 01:47:12,479
Real live nephew of my Uncle Sam

1768
01:47:12,604 --> 01:47:14,773
Born on the 4th of July

1769
01:47:15,482 --> 01:47:17,901
I've got a Yankee Doodle sweetheart

1770
01:47:18,109 --> 01:47:20,153
She's my Yankee Doodle joy

1771
01:47:20,403 --> 01:47:23,448
Yankee Doodle went to London
Just to ride the ponies

1772
01:47:23,573 --> 01:47:25,533
I am the Yankee Doodle boy

1773
01:47:26,326 --> 01:47:27,994
That was a big hit.

1774
01:47:29,162 --> 01:47:32,665
- Do you believe in God?
- I beg your pardon?

1775
01:47:33,666 --> 01:47:36,711
It's a simple question, Miss Bryant.
Now do you want me to repeat it?

1776
01:47:36,836 --> 01:47:38,046
I'm sorry, for a moment I thought

1777
01:47:38,171 --> 01:47:39,631
you asked me
if I believed there's a God.

1778
01:47:39,756 --> 01:47:41,925
That is precisely what I asked you.

1779
01:47:42,258 --> 01:47:45,178
I see. Well, I have no way of knowing.

1780
01:47:45,679 --> 01:47:47,430
Are you a Christian?

1781
01:47:47,681 --> 01:47:50,183
I was christened in the Catholic Church.

1782
01:47:50,308 --> 01:47:53,561
- Well, are you a Christian now?
- I suppose I am.

1783
01:47:54,270 --> 01:47:56,940
Do you believe
in Our Lord Jesus Christ?

1784
01:47:57,148 --> 01:48:01,069
I believe in the teachings of Christ.
Am I being tried for witchcraft?

1785
01:48:01,194 --> 01:48:02,320
Miss Bryant, tell me,

1786
01:48:02,445 --> 01:48:06,866
are there no decent, God-fearing
Christians among the Bolsheviks?

1787
01:48:07,033 --> 01:48:09,786
Does one have to be God-fearing
and Christian to be decent?

1788
01:48:09,869 --> 01:48:13,331
Senator, the Bolsheviks believe
that it's religion, particularly Christianity,

1789
01:48:13,415 --> 01:48:16,209
that's kept the Russian people back
for so many centuries.

1790
01:48:16,292 --> 01:48:17,794
- Miss Bryant...
- lf any of you'd ever been to Russia

1791
01:48:17,877 --> 01:48:20,130
and seen the peasants,
you might think they had a point.

1792
01:48:20,213 --> 01:48:22,215
On the subject of decency, Senator,

1793
01:48:22,340 --> 01:48:24,718
the Bolsheviks took power
with the slogan, "An end to the war."

1794
01:48:24,843 --> 01:48:28,013
Within six months, they made good
their promise to the Russian people.

1795
01:48:28,221 --> 01:48:30,432
Now, the present President
of the United States of America

1796
01:48:30,557 --> 01:48:33,893
went to this country in 1916,
on a "no war" ticket.

1797
01:48:33,977 --> 01:48:35,895
Within six months,
he'd taken us into the war,

1798
01:48:35,979 --> 01:48:39,024
and 115,000 young Americans
didn't come back.

1799
01:48:39,399 --> 01:48:41,359
If that's how decent,
God-fearing Christians behave,

1800
01:48:41,443 --> 01:48:43,403
give me atheists anytime.

1801
01:48:45,572 --> 01:48:48,408
By the way, Senator Overman,
in Russia, women have the vote,

1802
01:48:48,533 --> 01:48:50,243
which is more than you can say
for this country.

1803
01:48:50,368 --> 01:48:51,619
Miss Bryant,

1804
01:48:51,745 --> 01:48:55,040
do you advocate a Soviet government
for this country?

1805
01:48:55,415 --> 01:48:57,584
No. In this country
I don't think it would work.

1806
01:48:57,709 --> 01:48:59,085
In other words,
you mean the Red scare?

1807
01:48:59,169 --> 01:49:01,546
They got scared, or we got scared?

1808
01:49:02,297 --> 01:49:03,757
No, we didn't get scared.

1809
01:49:04,090 --> 01:49:08,219
They were afraid that the unions
would grow in strength.

1810
01:49:08,428 --> 01:49:12,223
A radical movement in America.
They were scared.

1811
01:49:12,307 --> 01:49:13,475
Oh, sure.

1812
01:49:13,600 --> 01:49:17,270
The Americans, they were frightened
to death by it, you know.

1813
01:49:17,395 --> 01:49:19,105
That it could occur here.

1814
01:49:19,230 --> 01:49:22,442
Sure. Everybody was in mortal dread

1815
01:49:22,609 --> 01:49:24,819
of the government descending on them.

1816
01:49:24,944 --> 01:49:27,739
The FBI or whatever it was,
don't you know.

1817
01:49:27,864 --> 01:49:29,574
We had to expose them.

1818
01:49:29,657 --> 01:49:32,660
And once they told American people
what Communism was...

1819
01:49:32,994 --> 01:49:35,538
People won't have nothing to do
with Communism now.

1820
01:49:35,622 --> 01:49:36,831
They know what it is.

1821
01:49:36,956 --> 01:49:39,584
But then, they didn't know.
It was a new thing.

1822
01:49:39,709 --> 01:49:43,338
Public opinion was
solidly against anyone

1823
01:49:43,630 --> 01:49:46,675
who had a good word
for the Russian Revolution.

1824
01:49:47,133 --> 01:49:52,055
But Louise was always communicating
what she had experienced.

1825
01:49:53,515 --> 01:49:55,350
I brought blankets, here,

1826
01:49:56,059 --> 01:49:58,395
and a heavy coat, here.

1827
01:49:59,979 --> 01:50:01,648
Chase and Sanborn.

1828
01:50:02,148 --> 01:50:03,108
Gloves.

1829
01:50:03,233 --> 01:50:06,277
Thank you, Jack.
Everyone else brought me hats.

1830
01:50:06,403 --> 01:50:10,448
And Louise sends you her best and this.

1831
01:50:12,242 --> 01:50:15,286
A scarf. Very kind.

1832
01:50:15,787 --> 01:50:17,789
I'm afraid your time is up.

1833
01:50:18,164 --> 01:50:19,332
Well,

1834
01:50:20,667 --> 01:50:23,044
we're going to keep fighting this.

1835
01:50:23,336 --> 01:50:26,464
Will you tell Max I'd like a picture
of myself in the magazine?

1836
01:50:26,589 --> 01:50:30,635
And under it, I would like the words,
"Deported in 1919.

1837
01:50:30,760 --> 01:50:32,554
"The government of the most
powerful country in the world

1838
01:50:32,679 --> 01:50:33,638
"is afraid of this woman."

1839
01:50:34,597 --> 01:50:36,850
We're going to get you back, E.G.

1840
01:50:37,642 --> 01:50:40,395
The revolution needs you.
We're gonna get you back.

1841
01:50:40,520 --> 01:50:43,231
Comrade, I'm not leaving
the revolution.

1842
01:50:43,440 --> 01:50:45,608
In Russia, I'll be joining it.

1843
01:50:45,775 --> 01:50:49,821
I urged the deportation of all

1844
01:50:51,614 --> 01:50:54,951
alien Communists.
All alien Communists.

1845
01:50:55,076 --> 01:50:57,871
It's bad enough having
a Communist with us,

1846
01:50:57,996 --> 01:51:00,790
but to have alien Communists
who are not citizens,

1847
01:51:00,957 --> 01:51:03,668
denouncing our form
of government and our republic

1848
01:51:03,752 --> 01:51:06,087
and everything else,
they should be deported.

1849
01:51:06,296 --> 01:51:09,466
And I led a big fight on that
for a long while.

1850
01:51:09,632 --> 01:51:12,302
It wasn't a very healthy atmosphere.

1851
01:51:12,886 --> 01:51:15,138
So when John Reed came along,

1852
01:51:15,221 --> 01:51:17,766
well, he was a voice of what I love.

1853
01:51:17,891 --> 01:51:22,437
He was able to go into the most
controversial subject of all,

1854
01:51:22,562 --> 01:51:24,064
Communism, Bolshevism.

1855
01:51:24,189 --> 01:51:28,193
He was considered one of the rare
persons who could do a thing like that.

1856
01:51:28,318 --> 01:51:31,279
He knew he was
on the threshold of history,

1857
01:51:31,404 --> 01:51:33,031
and he wrote it that way.

1858
01:51:39,913 --> 01:51:42,832
- A touch of this...
- Jack, I'm back!

1859
01:51:42,916 --> 01:51:44,542
I'm in here, honey.

1860
01:51:44,626 --> 01:51:47,045
I talked to Edmund and Alfred today
at Liveright's.

1861
01:51:47,128 --> 01:51:50,131
- What a day it's turned out to be.
- Stay out, honey! Stay out, stay out.

1862
01:51:50,507 --> 01:51:53,802
What are you doing in there?
Is everything okay?

1863
01:51:54,260 --> 01:51:55,887
- Can't I help?
- No, no, no, no!

1864
01:51:55,970 --> 01:51:57,847
Sure smells good. What is it?

1865
01:51:57,931 --> 01:51:59,265
Stay out, honey.
What did Edmund have to say?

1866
01:51:59,265 --> 01:51:59,933
Stay out, honey.
What did Edmund have to say?

1867
01:52:00,058 --> 01:52:03,186
He said in a few weeks
the steelworkers will strike.

1868
01:52:03,937 --> 01:52:07,899
He thinks at least 200,000 of them,
and maybe as many as 300,000.

1869
01:52:09,275 --> 01:52:11,736
But he doesn't think there's
any stopping them this time.

1870
01:52:11,820 --> 01:52:12,862
Yeah? That's good.

1871
01:52:12,946 --> 01:52:14,864
You still thinking
about doing a piece on it? I am.

1872
01:52:14,948 --> 01:52:18,159
Well, I can't really talk now,
but what does he say the next step is?

1873
01:52:18,284 --> 01:52:21,371
Evidently the federal government's
saying the steel organizers are Reds.

1874
01:52:21,454 --> 01:52:23,998
So what they're doing is
forming a bureau of investigation

1875
01:52:24,124 --> 01:52:26,042
just to look into subversive activity.

1876
01:52:26,167 --> 01:52:28,920
And you know, with all this talk
about the leadership of the AF of L

1877
01:52:29,004 --> 01:52:30,672
being in cahoots with the Steel Trust,

1878
01:52:30,797 --> 01:52:34,259
Alfred asked me if I was still gonna do
the piece on the IWW.

1879
01:52:34,342 --> 01:52:36,928
So I said, "Alfred, for the moment
I don't want to go any further away

1880
01:52:37,053 --> 01:52:38,930
- "than New Jersey."
- Really?

1881
01:52:39,014 --> 01:52:40,932
Oh, that's good. That's good.

1882
01:52:41,474 --> 01:52:43,101
- Just...
- Yeah, it is good.

1883
01:52:43,226 --> 01:52:46,146
Sit down. I'll just be a minute.

1884
01:52:47,897 --> 01:52:49,399
Jack, what are you doing?

1885
01:52:49,482 --> 01:52:53,153
- How did you leave it with Edmund?
- He's gonna read the piece on Debs.

1886
01:52:53,653 --> 01:52:55,488
Okay, the first course.

1887
01:52:55,739 --> 01:52:56,948
- Yeah?
- Sit down.

1888
01:52:58,158 --> 01:53:01,119
Sit down and close your eyes. Sit down.

1889
01:53:08,585 --> 01:53:09,627
Okay.

1890
01:53:12,672 --> 01:53:15,675
Oh, my.

1891
01:53:16,760 --> 01:53:17,802
My...

1892
01:53:19,095 --> 01:53:20,889
- Go ahead.
- Oh.

1893
01:53:28,396 --> 01:53:29,981
What do you think?

1894
01:53:31,358 --> 01:53:33,318
Really? You serious?

1895
01:53:35,487 --> 01:53:39,366
Really? Thank God.
I was gonna flamb them out here,

1896
01:53:39,574 --> 01:53:42,827
but the goddamn things flambed
themselves in the pan.

1897
01:53:43,078 --> 01:53:46,164
He was certainly the main inspiration

1898
01:53:46,414 --> 01:53:49,459
in the development
of a revolutionary movement

1899
01:53:49,542 --> 01:53:51,002
through his history

1900
01:53:51,086 --> 01:53:53,672
of Ten Days That Shook The World.

1901
01:53:53,880 --> 01:53:57,133
Ten Days That Shook The World
was, of course, his masterpiece.

1902
01:53:57,217 --> 01:54:00,136
He was there when
the Bolshevik Revolution took place.

1903
01:54:00,679 --> 01:54:02,847
And his was the best report of it.

1904
01:54:03,056 --> 01:54:05,850
Max Eastman had this story
that John Reed came down,

1905
01:54:06,101 --> 01:54:09,979
tousled hair all, you know...
And said he was writing a book

1906
01:54:10,063 --> 01:54:12,524
and not to disturb him for ten days.

1907
01:54:12,607 --> 01:54:15,402
And that became
Ten Days That Shook The World.

1908
01:54:16,569 --> 01:54:17,821
Supposedly.

1909
01:54:18,279 --> 01:54:21,199
He was an enormous,
enormous success,

1910
01:54:21,825 --> 01:54:26,121
and this success
largely changed his whole life, I think,

1911
01:54:26,454 --> 01:54:29,249
'cause he found out there was
something that he could do well,

1912
01:54:29,332 --> 01:54:31,251
do practically better than anyone else.

1913
01:54:31,626 --> 01:54:34,713
"Comrades, we have made
a great stride forward in our program

1914
01:54:34,838 --> 01:54:37,507
"to capture
the Socialist Party for Revolution.

1915
01:54:37,590 --> 01:54:40,593
"The time of right-wing domination
of the party has ended.

1916
01:54:40,719 --> 01:54:44,222
"They have fallen before the shining
example of revolutionary Russia

1917
01:54:44,347 --> 01:54:46,391
"like so many bowling pins!

1918
01:54:48,935 --> 01:54:51,896
"Comrades, we have done better
than we could have dreamed.

1919
01:54:52,022 --> 01:54:54,566
"The left wing has won 12
of the 15 seats

1920
01:54:54,649 --> 01:54:56,609
"on the Socialist Party Executive,

1921
01:54:56,693 --> 01:55:00,613
"including myself,
Edmund MacAlpine and Jack Reed."

1922
01:55:08,913 --> 01:55:12,000
He took a tremendous jump forward
from there on.

1923
01:55:12,500 --> 01:55:15,545
He became a revolutionist
on the workers' side,

1924
01:55:15,962 --> 01:55:18,798
and he had no more illusions
about people like Wilson.

1925
01:55:18,965 --> 01:55:20,091
We all have problems.

1926
01:55:20,216 --> 01:55:23,136
You can't escape having problems,
don't you know?

1927
01:55:23,261 --> 01:55:26,306
But to take on the problem
of all humanity,

1928
01:55:26,639 --> 01:55:28,516
to save all humanity,

1929
01:55:28,641 --> 01:55:31,770
my God, that was too big
even for Jesus Christ.

1930
01:55:31,895 --> 01:55:33,938
Don't you know
he got himself crucified?

1931
01:55:34,481 --> 01:55:37,359
How the hell do we expect
to do those things?

1932
01:55:43,990 --> 01:55:45,325
Oh.

1933
01:55:48,745 --> 01:55:50,955
Louise. Is that you?

1934
01:55:51,581 --> 01:55:52,999
Hello, Harry.

1935
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:57,170
Well, where have you been lately?
I haven't seen you in a long time.

1936
01:55:57,295 --> 01:55:59,339
That's right.
Is this thing gonna last all day?

1937
01:55:59,464 --> 01:56:01,132
It might. We've been kicked out.

1938
01:56:01,257 --> 01:56:03,760
- Kicked out of what?
- The Socialist Party.

1939
01:56:03,843 --> 01:56:06,304
- Wait, wait. Who got kicked out?
- Everybody in that room.

1940
01:56:06,388 --> 01:56:08,139
The Executive Committee
kicked us all out.

1941
01:56:08,223 --> 01:56:11,893
- The whole left wing?
- That's right. They nullified the election.

1942
01:56:12,143 --> 01:56:13,937
- Can they do that?
- They've done it.

1943
01:56:14,020 --> 01:56:15,355
We're the majority. We have the votes.

1944
01:56:15,480 --> 01:56:16,856
We weren't expelled
by the membership.

1945
01:56:16,981 --> 01:56:18,483
We were expelled by the executives.

1946
01:56:18,566 --> 01:56:20,235
And you're talking about doing exactly

1947
01:56:20,360 --> 01:56:22,195
what the Executive Committee
wants us to do.

1948
01:56:22,278 --> 01:56:24,072
Give the party back to them
without a fight!

1949
01:56:24,197 --> 01:56:26,449
Yes! And organize our own party!

1950
01:56:26,533 --> 01:56:29,411
Goddamn it, Louis,
the Socialist Party is our own party!

1951
01:56:29,536 --> 01:56:31,746
We were voted into power
by its membership

1952
01:56:31,871 --> 01:56:33,832
and we can't be expelled
by the executives.

1953
01:56:33,915 --> 01:56:37,377
It's an illegal act, and if we fight it
at the convention, we'll win.

1954
01:56:37,460 --> 01:56:38,586
Why do we have to fight?

1955
01:56:38,712 --> 01:56:39,921
What do you mean,
"Why do we have to fight?"

1956
01:56:40,046 --> 01:56:41,548
For what do we stay in a party

1957
01:56:41,673 --> 01:56:45,301
in which we must win control
from the minority, not once, but twice?

1958
01:56:45,385 --> 01:56:47,887
Well, what is it, Louis? You mean,
if we must fight for what we deserve,

1959
01:56:48,013 --> 01:56:50,807
then to hell with it?
Is that your idea of revolution?

1960
01:56:50,890 --> 01:56:53,601
I'd like to hear more about
your revolutionary concept, Louis.

1961
01:56:53,727 --> 01:56:56,855
My idea of revolution
is not a revolution in my own party!

1962
01:56:56,938 --> 01:57:00,942
And my idea of a socialist party
is not a debating society!

1963
01:57:01,067 --> 01:57:02,610
It is a party of action!

1964
01:57:02,736 --> 01:57:04,863
Fine! Fine.

1965
01:57:05,572 --> 01:57:08,533
The best example we can give them
is go to that convention

1966
01:57:08,616 --> 01:57:09,993
and take control of the party!

1967
01:57:10,076 --> 01:57:12,078
No! We form our own party!

1968
01:57:12,162 --> 01:57:15,498
And I hope that everybody here
who believe in Bolshevism

1969
01:57:15,582 --> 01:57:18,877
will be there that night
to help found that party!

1970
01:57:23,465 --> 01:57:25,383
All right, but I say you're wrong,

1971
01:57:25,467 --> 01:57:28,762
and I say that I'm gonna be there
at that Socialist Party convention

1972
01:57:28,845 --> 01:57:32,265
to take the seat that belongs to me,
and I urge everyone here today

1973
01:57:32,349 --> 01:57:35,060
to be there to take the seats
that belong to you!

1974
01:57:36,436 --> 01:57:38,772
It's almost like they want to be
separated from the masses.

1975
01:57:38,855 --> 01:57:41,191
They do want to be separated
from the masses. That's the point.

1976
01:57:41,608 --> 01:57:42,776
Let's go.

1977
01:57:44,444 --> 01:57:46,571
I've been in a minority before.

1978
01:57:47,822 --> 01:57:48,948
Hello.

1979
01:57:55,455 --> 01:57:56,998
While he liked the draft manifesto,

1980
01:57:57,123 --> 01:57:58,958
he's a bit nervous
about the social-patriot clause.

1981
01:57:59,042 --> 01:58:00,752
- Excuse me.
- Tactically, he's gonna be trouble.

1982
01:58:00,877 --> 01:58:02,671
Is he gonna bring his people
to the convention or not?

1983
01:58:02,796 --> 01:58:04,172
The man will talk theory
with you all year.

1984
01:58:04,297 --> 01:58:06,049
Well, I don't think so.
He'll go with Fraina.

1985
01:58:06,132 --> 01:58:08,968
Isn't that nice? He likes the manifesto.
How about Carnofsky?

1986
01:58:09,094 --> 01:58:11,304
I don't think we're gonna have
as much support as we thought, Jack.

1987
01:58:11,429 --> 01:58:13,306
We're gonna get in.
What did Carnofsky say?

1988
01:58:13,390 --> 01:58:15,183
- Carnofsky said no.
- I'm telling you, Jack...

1989
01:58:15,308 --> 01:58:17,477
- Just knowing on our own...
- Half of Fraina's people would come...

1990
01:58:17,602 --> 01:58:20,605
Come in!
Louise, please keep her quiet, will you?

1991
01:58:20,772 --> 01:58:21,940
- Hi, Eddie.
- How can...

1992
01:58:22,023 --> 01:58:24,693
- Hello, Eddie.
- Hello, Louise, Ben.

1993
01:58:24,818 --> 01:58:25,777
Hey.

1994
01:58:26,986 --> 01:58:28,405
Eddie, what about Levine?

1995
01:58:30,824 --> 01:58:32,909
- Eddie?
- Yeah.

1996
01:58:33,618 --> 01:58:36,705
- What did Levine say?
- He never showed. He...

1997
01:58:37,163 --> 01:58:38,748
I waited over an hour.

1998
01:58:38,832 --> 01:58:41,167
- Levine didn't show.
- That doesn't sound like Levine.

1999
01:58:41,292 --> 01:58:43,128
Sure it does. Where were you meeting?

2000
01:58:43,211 --> 01:58:44,295
In Casey's.

2001
01:58:44,379 --> 01:58:47,340
Now, that surprises me.
That really surprises me.

2002
01:58:47,716 --> 01:58:49,592
I could have missed him.

2003
01:58:50,927 --> 01:58:52,220
It was really busy in there.

2004
01:58:52,345 --> 01:58:54,097
- You could have missed him?
- What's that supposed to mean?

2005
01:58:55,348 --> 01:58:56,558
I was late.

2006
01:58:58,226 --> 01:58:59,477
How late?

2007
01:59:02,480 --> 01:59:04,482
Forty, forty-five minutes.

2008
01:59:05,483 --> 01:59:08,361
Nora started spitting up blood
again this morning.

2009
01:59:11,072 --> 01:59:12,323
I had to take her to the clinic,

2010
01:59:12,449 --> 01:59:15,994
and I had to wait for my mother
to come and pick up the kid.

2011
01:59:16,369 --> 01:59:18,288
So you were 45 minutes late.

2012
01:59:19,789 --> 01:59:22,417
Yeah. I thought I could make it.
I really did.

2013
01:59:22,542 --> 01:59:24,669
All right, we gotta get in touch
with the guy. How do we do it?

2014
01:59:24,753 --> 01:59:26,296
He's on his way to Chicago.

2015
01:59:26,379 --> 01:59:28,673
That's one of the reasons
I thought he would still be there.

2016
01:59:28,757 --> 01:59:30,342
Wait a minute,
you thought he'd still be there?

2017
01:59:31,509 --> 01:59:34,095
- Yeah.
- Who asked for the meeting, Eddie?

2018
01:59:34,721 --> 01:59:36,681
- Who asked for the meeting?
- Who asked for the meeting?

2019
01:59:36,765 --> 01:59:39,059
- Did Levine want the meeting?
- Yeah, I thought he wanted it.

2020
01:59:39,225 --> 01:59:40,685
Did he call us?

2021
01:59:41,394 --> 01:59:42,354
No. We called him.

2022
01:59:42,479 --> 01:59:45,190
Then why would he wait?
We wanted the meeting.

2023
01:59:51,237 --> 01:59:52,364
I'm sorry.

2024
01:59:52,489 --> 01:59:55,075
Well, why didn't you call one of us
and get somebody to take your place?

2025
01:59:56,493 --> 01:59:58,411
Because I thought I could make it.

2026
01:59:58,536 --> 02:00:00,038
I mean, I thought the man
would still be there.

2027
02:00:00,163 --> 02:00:03,875
You thought, you thought, you thought.
Try not to think too much, Eddie.

2028
02:00:03,958 --> 02:00:06,795
Not when your comrades
are depending on you.

2029
02:00:07,879 --> 02:00:09,047
Be sure.

2030
02:00:14,427 --> 02:00:15,553
All right, look.

2031
02:00:15,679 --> 02:00:18,473
Do we have a contact
for Levine in Chicago?

2032
02:00:18,682 --> 02:00:19,933
Let's call Singer.

2033
02:00:20,058 --> 02:00:22,560
- Do you have a number for him?
- Yeah. Well, I've probably got it.

2034
02:00:25,814 --> 02:00:27,107
Here.

2035
02:00:28,400 --> 02:00:29,609
Thanks.

2036
02:00:30,860 --> 02:00:32,028
You know, they might work better

2037
02:00:32,112 --> 02:00:35,240
if you put something in your stomach
besides coffee.

2038
02:00:36,032 --> 02:00:38,952
You're a little hard on Eddie,
aren't you, under the circumstances?

2039
02:00:39,035 --> 02:00:40,954
You think my sympathies
can help Eddie's wife?

2040
02:00:41,079 --> 02:00:42,622
Might help Eddie.

2041
02:00:42,747 --> 02:00:45,750
Listen to me.
Building a party will help Eddie.

2042
02:00:53,466 --> 02:00:55,218
Four, eight, twelve...

2043
02:01:02,142 --> 02:01:05,437
You know, I think we all believe
in the same things.

2044
02:01:08,106 --> 02:01:09,482
But with us,

2045
02:01:11,317 --> 02:01:13,653
it's more or less our good intentions.

2046
02:01:16,031 --> 02:01:18,241
And with Jack, it's a religion.

2047
02:01:27,625 --> 02:01:30,503
Our old friend Jack's
getting serious on us.

2048
02:01:35,508 --> 02:01:37,135
Okay. Hey, Frank, how are you?

2049
02:01:37,218 --> 02:01:38,511
How are you?

2050
02:01:41,973 --> 02:01:43,933
Excuse me. What's happening here?

2051
02:01:44,017 --> 02:01:46,853
No one's admitted without a red card.
That's the order of the Executive.

2052
02:01:46,978 --> 02:01:49,272
Well, I'm on the Executive,
so is he, so is he...

2053
02:01:49,356 --> 02:01:51,858
- No one's admitted without a red card.
- Where do we get the red cards?

2054
02:01:51,983 --> 02:01:53,860
You'll have to take that up
with the Credentials Committee.

2055
02:01:53,943 --> 02:01:55,195
And where's
the Credentials Committee?

2056
02:01:55,195 --> 02:01:55,528
And where's
the Credentials Committee?

2057
02:01:55,653 --> 02:01:57,072
I don't know.

2058
02:01:57,572 --> 02:01:59,616
I don't think he wants us to go in there.

2059
02:01:59,699 --> 02:02:01,618
Well, the way to take the hall
is to take the hall.

2060
02:02:01,701 --> 02:02:03,036
Edmund!

2061
02:02:03,119 --> 02:02:04,537
Edmund! Jack!

2062
02:02:05,246 --> 02:02:08,666
Okay. Let's go. Let's go.
Come on, this way!

2063
02:02:12,212 --> 02:02:15,382
To propose the agenda,
I would like to read a message

2064
02:02:15,507 --> 02:02:19,135
from the Credentials Committee
to the floor.

2065
02:02:19,260 --> 02:02:22,347
May we please have order back there?

2066
02:02:23,056 --> 02:02:25,141
In the back of the hall, could we have...

2067
02:02:25,225 --> 02:02:28,728
Sergeant-at-arms, would you see
what's going on back there?

2068
02:02:29,187 --> 02:02:32,649
Ladies and gentlemen, it seems
we have a group of intruders

2069
02:02:32,732 --> 02:02:35,110
who are trying to take over
this conference.

2070
02:02:35,360 --> 02:02:37,320
We're not going to let them.

2071
02:02:37,404 --> 02:02:41,199
Now, please, please sit down.
I need these aisles clear.

2072
02:02:41,282 --> 02:02:44,452
Sergeant-at-arms,
I must have these aisles clear!

2073
02:02:44,577 --> 02:02:46,413
Please, everyone, sit down.

2074
02:02:46,663 --> 02:02:49,541
Now, these are Bolshevik sympathizers

2075
02:02:49,624 --> 02:02:53,712
who are trying to take over this party,
and we're not going to let them.

2076
02:02:53,920 --> 02:02:55,755
The police are coming.

2077
02:02:56,715 --> 02:03:01,553
These people aren't socialists.
These people are just thugs!

2078
02:03:01,928 --> 02:03:04,264
Now you see? That is Bolshevik tactics!

2079
02:03:04,347 --> 02:03:06,349
Come on, delegates.
These people are imposters!

2080
02:03:06,433 --> 02:03:08,560
They were not elected
to the leadership of this party.

2081
02:03:08,685 --> 02:03:10,770
Ladies and gentlemen,
the police are coming!

2082
02:03:12,188 --> 02:03:14,524
- You see? The police.
- What the hell is this?

2083
02:03:14,607 --> 02:03:17,610
That's the only way the Executive
Committee can stay in power,

2084
02:03:17,736 --> 02:03:19,446
is by the use of the capitalist police.

2085
02:03:19,571 --> 02:03:20,780
Flash your red cards!

2086
02:03:20,905 --> 02:03:23,324
They'll resort to any tactics
to keep the working class

2087
02:03:23,450 --> 02:03:26,786
away from its true leadership
because they're afraid of revolution!

2088
02:03:26,911 --> 02:03:31,207
Officers, whoever has no red card
does not belong in this room.

2089
02:03:31,291 --> 02:03:32,417
Hold up your red cards.

2090
02:03:32,500 --> 02:03:35,128
It's all right. We're going.
You don't have to throw us out.

2091
02:03:35,253 --> 02:03:36,921
If you want to know
where the true leadership

2092
02:03:37,047 --> 02:03:38,673
of the Socialist Party of America is,

2093
02:03:38,798 --> 02:03:41,676
it'll be in the basement of this building
in five minutes...

2094
02:03:41,801 --> 02:03:44,554
- Red cards, everybody!
...and you're welcome to join us.

2095
02:03:44,637 --> 02:03:48,475
I want anybody who does not have
a red card to be out of this hall.

2096
02:04:36,022 --> 02:04:39,109
Comrade Chairman, I move that
we immediately constitute ourselves

2097
02:04:39,192 --> 02:04:40,860
as the bona fide Communist party,

2098
02:04:40,985 --> 02:04:43,238
and that we call ourselves
the Communist Labor Party of America.

2099
02:04:43,363 --> 02:04:44,322
I second that motion!

2100
02:04:44,447 --> 02:04:46,574
Well, look, if we're gonna have
a really revolutionary party,

2101
02:04:46,700 --> 02:04:49,327
I think what we have to do
is to find out from the American worker

2102
02:04:49,452 --> 02:04:52,163
what he wants the most and then
we have to translate it back to him

2103
02:04:52,288 --> 02:04:54,165
in terms of the labor movement
as a whole.

2104
02:04:54,249 --> 02:04:55,834
What we have to do
is make him want more.

2105
02:04:55,917 --> 02:04:58,670
We have to make him want
the whole goddamn revolution.

2106
02:04:58,753 --> 02:05:01,297
Those people upstairs
think that Karl Marx was somebody

2107
02:05:01,381 --> 02:05:03,008
who wrote a good antitrust law.

2108
02:05:03,133 --> 02:05:05,301
And whether we call our party
the Socialist Labor Party

2109
02:05:05,385 --> 02:05:07,637
or the Real Socialist Communist...
Whatever we call the party,

2110
02:05:07,721 --> 02:05:09,931
it doesn't matter because it...

2111
02:05:10,974 --> 02:05:12,684
Hello, Lou, are you lost?

2112
02:05:12,809 --> 02:05:15,770
No. I'm not lost.
I'm here to tell my friends

2113
02:05:15,895 --> 02:05:18,440
that the newly-formed
Communist Party of America

2114
02:05:18,565 --> 02:05:21,776
is meeting at the Russian Federation
on Blue Island Avenue.

2115
02:05:21,901 --> 02:05:23,987
We welcome your applications.

2116
02:05:24,112 --> 02:05:26,656
They will be judged
on an individual basis.

2117
02:05:26,740 --> 02:05:28,408
You're gonna judge our applications?

2118
02:05:28,533 --> 02:05:30,452
We're gonna apply to you
for membership?

2119
02:05:30,577 --> 02:05:32,954
Comrade Chairman,
I'd like to call that question, please.

2120
02:05:33,079 --> 02:05:34,789
The motion has been made
and seconded that

2121
02:05:34,914 --> 02:05:38,376
we immediately constitute ourselves
as the bona fide Communist party

2122
02:05:38,460 --> 02:05:41,504
and that we call ourselves
the Communist Labor Party of America.

2123
02:05:41,588 --> 02:05:44,007
All those in favor,
please signify by saying aye.

2124
02:05:44,090 --> 02:05:45,133
Aye!

2125
02:05:45,258 --> 02:05:47,135
Opposed? Motion is carried.

2126
02:05:48,762 --> 02:05:50,388
Comrades! Comrades!

2127
02:05:50,472 --> 02:05:54,267
Comrades, this is the wrong time
to be fighting against one another.

2128
02:05:54,351 --> 02:05:57,395
We should be united in our struggle
against the capitalists.

2129
02:05:57,479 --> 02:05:59,564
You should have thought of that
six weeks ago, Louis.

2130
02:05:59,647 --> 02:06:02,192
If your people had stayed with us,
we'd have had a majority,

2131
02:06:02,275 --> 02:06:04,069
and we'd be in control
of that convention upstairs.

2132
02:06:04,152 --> 02:06:05,862
We have five times your membership!

2133
02:06:05,945 --> 02:06:08,448
Louis, your arithmetic's
something like your politics.

2134
02:06:08,573 --> 02:06:12,118
We will be at the Russian Federation
on Blue Island Avenue.

2135
02:06:12,285 --> 02:06:13,912
I hope to see some of you there.

2136
02:06:14,037 --> 02:06:16,456
Comrade Chairman, I move we
immediately send a delegate to Moscow

2137
02:06:16,581 --> 02:06:18,083
to gain recognition by the Comintern

2138
02:06:18,208 --> 02:06:19,751
for the Communist Labor Party
of America,

2139
02:06:19,876 --> 02:06:22,504
- and that delegate be Jack Reed.
- Second the motion!

2140
02:06:22,629 --> 02:06:24,631
The motion has been made
and seconded to send Jack Reed

2141
02:06:24,756 --> 02:06:26,758
to Moscow immediately
as the international delegate

2142
02:06:26,841 --> 02:06:28,802
to obtain recognition of the Comintern

2143
02:06:28,927 --> 02:06:31,096
for the Communist Labor Party
of America.

2144
02:06:31,221 --> 02:06:33,264
All those in favor,
please signify by saying aye.

2145
02:06:33,348 --> 02:06:34,349
Aye!

2146
02:06:34,474 --> 02:06:36,518
Opposed? Motion is carried.

2147
02:06:37,727 --> 02:06:40,313
Since the first question
I'm going to be asked...

2148
02:06:40,438 --> 02:06:41,648
All right, thank you.

2149
02:06:41,773 --> 02:06:44,192
All right, comrades, since
the first question I'm gonna be asked

2150
02:06:44,317 --> 02:06:47,070
by the Comintern is gonna be
about membership eligibility,

2151
02:06:47,153 --> 02:06:49,864
I think I'm gonna have to be very clear
what our position is

2152
02:06:49,989 --> 02:06:51,908
in relation to
the Foreign Language Federation.

2153
02:06:51,991 --> 02:06:54,244
I'm gonna have to say exactly
what our requirements are

2154
02:06:54,327 --> 02:06:55,620
as opposed to any other group,

2155
02:06:55,704 --> 02:06:58,373
and I think we'll have to make it clear
on our Platform Committee

2156
02:06:58,498 --> 02:06:59,833
and be very clear in the manifesto.

2157
02:06:59,958 --> 02:07:01,167
- Good luck in Moscow, Jack!
- Okay, Harry.

2158
02:07:01,292 --> 02:07:04,045
Well, I guess you boys think
you can run a newspaper without me.

2159
02:07:18,018 --> 02:07:19,477
Hello, Jessie.

2160
02:07:22,522 --> 02:07:23,523
Good girl.

2161
02:07:26,192 --> 02:07:27,861
- Hello.
- Hello.

2162
02:08:04,939 --> 02:08:08,401
Let me make it easy for you, Jack.
I'm not going with you.

2163
02:08:15,283 --> 02:08:18,370
And if you go, I'm not sure I'll be here
when you get back.

2164
02:08:19,704 --> 02:08:24,501
Louise, you know, the Comintern
doesn't know Edmund or Alfred

2165
02:08:24,584 --> 02:08:26,586
from the New York Yankees.
They know me.

2166
02:08:26,711 --> 02:08:29,214
Somebody's got to go over there
who's got a background.

2167
02:08:33,051 --> 02:08:35,011
We'd be back by Christmas.

2168
02:08:39,265 --> 02:08:40,725
We can't merge with Fraina.

2169
02:08:40,809 --> 02:08:42,686
We can't deal with him
on membership eligibility.

2170
02:08:42,769 --> 02:08:44,896
He wouldn't accept half of our people.

2171
02:08:44,979 --> 02:08:47,232
The man is gonna do nothing
but alienate himself

2172
02:08:47,357 --> 02:08:49,818
from any potential
broad base of support.

2173
02:08:49,943 --> 02:08:51,403
He's sociologically isolated,

2174
02:08:51,528 --> 02:08:53,071
programmatically he's impossible
to deal with...

2175
02:08:53,154 --> 02:08:55,115
You mean he's a foreigner?

2176
02:08:55,448 --> 02:08:56,866
Don't do that, Louise.

2177
02:08:56,950 --> 02:08:58,326
Six months ago, you were friends.

2178
02:08:58,451 --> 02:08:59,911
These people can barely speak English.

2179
02:08:59,994 --> 02:09:02,455
They don't even want to be integrated
into American life.

2180
02:09:02,872 --> 02:09:05,083
The Foreign Language Federations
aren't gonna create Bolshevism

2181
02:09:05,166 --> 02:09:07,836
in America any more
than eating borscht will.

2182
02:09:07,961 --> 02:09:09,504
Being Russian
doesn't make a revolution.

2183
02:09:09,629 --> 02:09:10,755
Do you think the American workers

2184
02:09:10,839 --> 02:09:12,424
are gonna be led
by the Russian federations?

2185
02:09:12,507 --> 02:09:14,551
Or an insular Italian like Louis Fraina?

2186
02:09:14,634 --> 02:09:17,137
He has no possibility
of leading a revolution in this country.

2187
02:09:17,220 --> 02:09:18,388
Unlike you?

2188
02:09:18,471 --> 02:09:20,265
I'm just saying
that the revolution in this country

2189
02:09:20,390 --> 02:09:21,683
is not gonna be led by immigrants.

2190
02:09:21,808 --> 02:09:26,312
Revolution? In this country?
When, Jack? Just after Christmas?

2191
02:09:26,604 --> 02:09:28,523
Well, what do you think
we could've done with the steel strike

2192
02:09:28,648 --> 02:09:29,649
if we'd been ready?

2193
02:09:29,774 --> 02:09:33,153
30,000 party members all armed
with a unified theory and program

2194
02:09:33,278 --> 02:09:35,613
leading 365,000 steelworkers?

2195
02:09:35,697 --> 02:09:37,449
What it takes is leadership.

2196
02:09:37,574 --> 02:09:39,909
And we gotta get it
by getting recognition from Moscow.

2197
02:09:39,993 --> 02:09:41,453
- I have to go.
- You don't have to go.

2198
02:09:41,536 --> 02:09:44,289
You want to go. You want to go running
all over the world ranting and raving

2199
02:09:44,414 --> 02:09:46,791
and making resolutions
and organizing caucuses.

2200
02:09:46,875 --> 02:09:48,668
What's the difference
between the Communist Party

2201
02:09:48,793 --> 02:09:50,086
and the Communist Labor Party

2202
02:09:50,211 --> 02:09:52,422
except that you're running one
and he's running the other?

2203
02:09:52,505 --> 02:09:54,674
- I've made a commitment.
- To what?

2204
02:09:55,675 --> 02:09:58,386
To the fine distinction between
which half of the left of the left

2205
02:09:58,511 --> 02:10:01,806
is recognized by Moscow as
the real Communist Party in America?

2206
02:10:01,890 --> 02:10:05,101
To petty political squabbling between
humorless and hack politicians

2207
02:10:05,185 --> 02:10:07,354
just wasting their time
on left-wing dogma?

2208
02:10:08,146 --> 02:10:10,190
To getting the endorsement
of a committee in Russia

2209
02:10:10,315 --> 02:10:11,441
you call the International

2210
02:10:11,524 --> 02:10:14,069
for your group of 14 intellectual friends
in the basement

2211
02:10:14,194 --> 02:10:16,488
who are supposed to tell the workers
of this country what they want,

2212
02:10:16,571 --> 02:10:18,114
whether they want it or not?

2213
02:10:25,872 --> 02:10:27,248
Write, Jack.

2214
02:10:29,542 --> 02:10:31,670
You're not a politician, you're a writer.

2215
02:10:31,753 --> 02:10:33,505
And your writing has done more
for the revolution

2216
02:10:33,588 --> 02:10:36,341
than 20 years of this infighting can do,
and you know it.

2217
02:10:37,384 --> 02:10:39,260
You're an artist, Jack.

2218
02:11:01,783 --> 02:11:03,034
Don't go.

2219
02:11:04,160 --> 02:11:06,871
Don't run away
from what you do the best.

2220
02:11:10,417 --> 02:11:11,501
Jack.

2221
02:11:21,219 --> 02:11:22,887
I'll be back by Christmas.

2222
02:11:48,872 --> 02:11:51,583
I'm going into the city.
When do you leave?

2223
02:11:51,708 --> 02:11:52,917
Tomorrow.

2224
02:11:53,626 --> 02:11:56,004
- I see.
- I'll be back by Christmas.

2225
02:11:56,963 --> 02:11:58,590
Will you be here?

2226
02:12:01,509 --> 02:12:04,346
I don't know. I'll see you when I see you.

2227
02:12:20,904 --> 02:12:24,741
Here. Your passport and papers.
Your name's James Gormley.

2228
02:12:26,493 --> 02:12:27,660
Go now!

2229
02:13:12,038 --> 02:13:15,667
Well, Mrs. Reed. Sit down.

2230
02:13:16,543 --> 02:13:18,294
What can I do for you?

2231
02:13:18,378 --> 02:13:21,381
Hello, Gene. How are you?

2232
02:13:22,549 --> 02:13:25,427
Fine. And you?

2233
02:13:26,261 --> 02:13:27,512
I'm fine.

2234
02:13:40,442 --> 02:13:41,693
Sit down.

2235
02:13:47,657 --> 02:13:51,077
- How's Jack?
- He's fine. He's in Russia.

2236
02:13:51,161 --> 02:13:52,287
- Is he?
- Yes.

2237
02:13:52,412 --> 02:13:54,164
He's trying to get recognition
from the Comintern

2238
02:13:54,247 --> 02:13:56,374
for the Communist Labor Party.

2239
02:13:56,499 --> 02:13:59,377
You see, they've split
into two different factions.

2240
02:13:59,627 --> 02:14:03,298
And you?
Left alone with your work again?

2241
02:14:05,133 --> 02:14:06,134
No.

2242
02:14:06,551 --> 02:14:08,928
Well, actually, yes,
but my work is different now.

2243
02:14:09,054 --> 02:14:11,848
I do a lot of lecturing
about what I saw in Russia.

2244
02:14:11,931 --> 02:14:13,516
Ah, yes, Russia.

2245
02:14:14,601 --> 02:14:17,103
Russia's been good for you and Jack.

2246
02:14:17,354 --> 02:14:21,316
Given you a way to meet people,
given him a reason to leave home.

2247
02:14:23,109 --> 02:14:24,277
Russia.

2248
02:14:25,570 --> 02:14:26,696
Russia.

2249
02:14:26,780 --> 02:14:29,491
Are you really that cynical,
or are you angry with me?

2250
02:14:29,616 --> 02:14:32,327
I'm really that cynical.
Why would I be angry with you?

2251
02:14:32,452 --> 02:14:33,870
Gene, if you'd been to Russia,

2252
02:14:33,953 --> 02:14:35,997
you'd never be cynical
about anything again.

2253
02:14:36,122 --> 02:14:38,917
You would have seen
people transformed. Ordinary people.

2254
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:43,588
Louise, something in me tightens when
an American intellectual's eyes shine

2255
02:14:43,922 --> 02:14:46,966
and they start to talk to me
about the Russian people.

2256
02:14:47,133 --> 02:14:48,968
- Wait...
- Something in me says, "Watch it.

2257
02:14:49,094 --> 02:14:53,139
"A new version of Irish Catholicism
is being offered for your faith."

2258
02:14:53,306 --> 02:14:54,849
- It's not like that.
- And I wonder why

2259
02:14:54,974 --> 02:14:59,562
a lovely wife like Louise Reed
who's just seen the brave new world

2260
02:14:59,646 --> 02:15:02,023
is sitting around
with a cynical bastard like me

2261
02:15:02,148 --> 02:15:06,069
instead of trotting all over Russia
with her idealistic husband.

2262
02:15:06,653 --> 02:15:10,281
It's almost worth being converted.

2263
02:15:13,535 --> 02:15:15,453
Well, I was wrong to come.

2264
02:15:16,246 --> 02:15:20,166
You and Jack have a lot of
middle-class dreams for two radicals.

2265
02:15:21,084 --> 02:15:24,504
Jack dreams that he can hustle
the American working man,

2266
02:15:24,587 --> 02:15:27,340
whose one dream is to be rich enough
not to have to work,

2267
02:15:27,465 --> 02:15:29,968
into a revolution led by his party.

2268
02:15:30,135 --> 02:15:32,971
And you dream that if you discuss
the revolution with a man

2269
02:15:33,054 --> 02:15:34,764
before you go to bed with him,

2270
02:15:34,848 --> 02:15:37,183
it'll be missionary work rather than sex.

2271
02:15:37,851 --> 02:15:41,271
I'm sorry to see you and Jack
so serious about your sports.

2272
02:15:41,354 --> 02:15:43,857
It's particularly disappointing
in you, Louise.

2273
02:15:43,940 --> 02:15:47,610
You had a lighter touch
when you were touting free love.

2274
02:15:50,196 --> 02:15:52,991
Boy, you've become quite the critic,
haven't you, Gene?

2275
02:15:53,116 --> 02:15:55,660
Just leaned back and analyzed us all.

2276
02:15:55,994 --> 02:15:58,621
Duplicitous women who tout free love
and then get married,

2277
02:15:58,705 --> 02:16:00,957
power-mad journalists
who join the revolution

2278
02:16:01,041 --> 02:16:02,334
instead of observing it,

2279
02:16:02,417 --> 02:16:04,544
middle-class radicals
who come looking for sex

2280
02:16:04,669 --> 02:16:06,129
and then talk about Russia.

2281
02:16:06,212 --> 02:16:08,381
It must seem so contemptible
to a man like you

2282
02:16:08,506 --> 02:16:11,426
who has the courage to sit on his ass
and observe human inadequacy

2283
02:16:11,551 --> 02:16:13,219
from the inside of a bottle.

2284
02:16:13,345 --> 02:16:15,513
Well, I've never seen you
do anything for anyone.

2285
02:16:15,638 --> 02:16:17,098
I've never seen you
give anything to anyone,

2286
02:16:17,223 --> 02:16:20,602
so I can understand why you might
suspect the motives of those who have.

2287
02:16:20,727 --> 02:16:23,063
But whatever Jack's motives are, how...

2288
02:16:24,731 --> 02:16:26,941
I seem to have touched a wound.

2289
02:16:29,444 --> 02:16:30,862
You're a wounding son of a bitch,

2290
02:16:30,945 --> 02:16:34,282
and whatever I've done to you,
you've made me pay for it.

2291
02:16:36,117 --> 02:16:37,369
Louise.

2292
02:17:06,523 --> 02:17:07,691
Jessie!

2293
02:17:08,274 --> 02:17:11,277
Hey, Jess, come on! Come here, Jess.

2294
02:17:11,653 --> 02:17:13,238
Jessie, come here.

2295
02:17:18,785 --> 02:17:19,911
Jessie.

2296
02:17:56,948 --> 02:17:58,116
Jessie?

2297
02:18:16,051 --> 02:18:17,052
Jessie?

2298
02:18:17,177 --> 02:18:18,636
- Oh!
- Good evening.

2299
02:18:18,762 --> 02:18:20,889
By the order of the Attorney General
of the United States,

2300
02:18:21,014 --> 02:18:22,682
A. Mitchell Palmer,
I have a warrant here

2301
02:18:22,807 --> 02:18:24,517
for the arrest of one John Silas Reed.

2302
02:18:24,642 --> 02:18:26,394
Look upstairs, Frank.

2303
02:18:33,443 --> 02:18:35,570
- Arrest for what?
- Sedition.

2304
02:18:36,321 --> 02:18:38,406
- Where is he?
- What do you mean by sedition?

2305
02:18:38,531 --> 02:18:40,825
Lady, don't ask me.
Ask Woodrow Wilson.

2306
02:18:40,909 --> 02:18:42,660
Just tell me where he is.

2307
02:18:48,124 --> 02:18:49,334
I don't suppose there's a chance

2308
02:18:49,417 --> 02:18:51,878
of you being a Bolshevik agitator,
is there?

2309
02:18:52,712 --> 02:18:55,882
Why don't you just look around,
and see how agitated you get?

2310
02:18:56,341 --> 02:18:58,301
In 1919,

2311
02:18:58,885 --> 02:19:00,929
there were no more

2312
02:19:01,054 --> 02:19:04,557
than four or five Americans

2313
02:19:04,849 --> 02:19:06,726
who got into Russia

2314
02:19:06,893 --> 02:19:11,773
because the country was surrounded
on all sides.

2315
02:19:12,190 --> 02:19:16,069
You were actually forbidden to go,
and you could only go illegally.

2316
02:19:16,277 --> 02:19:19,155
It was very dangerous
to go through Finland.

2317
02:19:19,489 --> 02:19:21,991
Because the Finns
were a White government,

2318
02:19:22,075 --> 02:19:25,036
and they were bitterly opposed
to the Reds.

2319
02:19:25,412 --> 02:19:27,205
They decided to strangle

2320
02:19:27,288 --> 02:19:30,667
the revolutionary Bolshevik infant
in its cradle.

2321
02:19:30,750 --> 02:19:34,879
And 16 armies went into Russia
from the east and from the west,

2322
02:19:35,130 --> 02:19:37,382
for the purpose
of wiping out the Bolsheviks

2323
02:19:37,507 --> 02:19:39,426
and wiping out the revolution

2324
02:19:39,509 --> 02:19:43,847
and restoring Christian civilization
to its rightful place.

2325
02:20:09,622 --> 02:20:10,957
Speak English.

2326
02:20:11,041 --> 02:20:13,251
Have a lemon.
You won't see one for a long time.

2327
02:20:13,376 --> 02:20:16,796
Thank you. I just want to know
if you think that I was clear

2328
02:20:16,921 --> 02:20:19,090
- in what I said about...
- Eminently clear.

2329
02:20:19,215 --> 02:20:20,258
Salt?

2330
02:20:21,968 --> 02:20:23,720
- Salt?
- For the lemon.

2331
02:20:24,304 --> 02:20:25,597
Thank you.

2332
02:20:27,682 --> 02:20:30,268
I see you eat the peel with the lemon.

2333
02:20:30,518 --> 02:20:33,480
Fights the scurvy. So does the onion.

2334
02:20:34,314 --> 02:20:36,608
Together, they fight better.

2335
02:20:38,818 --> 02:20:41,363
You see, what I really wanted to do

2336
02:20:41,488 --> 02:20:44,032
was ask your frank opinion
whether we...

2337
02:20:44,157 --> 02:20:47,243
You think we'll get the endorsement
from the committee.

2338
02:20:47,369 --> 02:20:50,330
- I ask unofficially, of course.
- Unofficially?

2339
02:20:53,625 --> 02:20:55,627
Unofficially, I don't know.

2340
02:20:56,753 --> 02:20:59,089
Yeah, well, it's such a...

2341
02:20:59,339 --> 02:21:02,550
It's a peculiarly American problem
and I...

2342
02:21:03,009 --> 02:21:05,637
- You do think I was clear?
- Quite clear.

2343
02:21:05,929 --> 02:21:09,974
In this case, however, clarity does not
necessarily guarantee endorsement.

2344
02:21:10,183 --> 02:21:13,144
Well, I don't know.
In this case, I think perhaps it might.

2345
02:21:13,269 --> 02:21:17,023
You know, in fact, I don't...

2346
02:21:17,148 --> 02:21:20,026
What I really want to do
is to make a detailed report

2347
02:21:20,151 --> 02:21:22,987
for the Executive Committee to read
on conditions in America.

2348
02:21:23,071 --> 02:21:26,157
You see, I'd like to deal in that report
with the entire history

2349
02:21:26,241 --> 02:21:27,867
of the American Federation of Labor.

2350
02:21:27,992 --> 02:21:30,161
I'd like to deal
with its support of the war, you see.

2351
02:21:30,245 --> 02:21:33,498
And I'm gonna talk
about the persecution of the IWW,

2352
02:21:33,623 --> 02:21:36,167
I'm gonna deal with the rise
of the patrioteering societies,

2353
02:21:36,251 --> 02:21:38,128
and the capitulation
of leading socialists.

2354
02:21:38,211 --> 02:21:40,755
- I'm gonna... Am I speaking too quickly?
- No, no. Go on.

2355
02:21:40,922 --> 02:21:45,635
And so I will deal with
the rising militancy of American labor.

2356
02:21:45,802 --> 02:21:49,514
I'll talk about the general strikes
in Seattle and Winnipeg,

2357
02:21:49,639 --> 02:21:51,016
the Boston police strike.

2358
02:21:51,099 --> 02:21:54,185
I'm gonna discuss the Plumb Plan,
and particularly the attitude

2359
02:21:54,269 --> 02:21:57,022
and the policies of the AF of L
and IWW toward them.

2360
02:21:57,147 --> 02:21:59,149
Now, after that, I think it's important...

2361
02:22:06,489 --> 02:22:08,992
Comrade Reed, the Executive
Committee of the Comintern

2362
02:22:09,159 --> 02:22:12,370
has decided against endorsing
either the Communist Labor Party

2363
02:22:12,495 --> 02:22:14,456
or the Communist Party of America,

2364
02:22:14,581 --> 02:22:17,500
and instructs the two parties
to merge forthwith.

2365
02:22:22,964 --> 02:22:24,215
Sit here, Comrade Reed.

2366
02:22:24,299 --> 02:22:26,259
This time, your usual chair,
as you can see,

2367
02:22:26,384 --> 02:22:29,346
is now occupied by your detailed report
on American conditions.

2368
02:22:29,429 --> 02:22:31,931
A most penetrating study.
Very, very clear.

2369
02:22:32,098 --> 02:22:33,266
Thank you.

2370
02:22:33,808 --> 02:22:35,977
Obviously, it wasn't clear enough.

2371
02:22:36,978 --> 02:22:38,104
Comrade Radek,

2372
02:22:38,229 --> 02:22:40,732
I think there must have been
some mistake

2373
02:22:40,857 --> 02:22:43,943
about my travel arrangements
about my return to the United States.

2374
02:22:44,861 --> 02:22:49,240
Well, it seems as if I've been asked
to report to the Propaganda Bureau.

2375
02:22:49,324 --> 02:22:50,450
That is right.

2376
02:22:50,575 --> 02:22:53,953
Comrade Reed,
the Executive Committee has decided

2377
02:22:54,037 --> 02:22:56,623
you are very much needed
at the Propaganda Bureau.

2378
02:22:56,748 --> 02:22:59,417
We plan for you to remain
in Soviet Russia until July.

2379
02:22:59,501 --> 02:23:01,586
You're very welcome
to the Bureau of Propaganda.

2380
02:23:01,670 --> 02:23:02,962
Well, thank you very much,

2381
02:23:03,088 --> 02:23:05,799
but I thought that these
travel arrangements had been made.

2382
02:23:05,924 --> 02:23:08,218
I have to get to the Latvian
or the Finnish border.

2383
02:23:08,301 --> 02:23:10,470
And to which border would you suggest,
Comrade Reed?

2384
02:23:10,595 --> 02:23:13,098
Well, I understand that train travel
is very dangerous at the moment...

2385
02:23:13,181 --> 02:23:14,766
Why does he need a train?

2386
02:23:15,850 --> 02:23:19,145
Because I have urgent personal
considerations and responsibilities

2387
02:23:19,270 --> 02:23:21,439
- in the United States and I...
- Of what nature?

2388
02:23:22,315 --> 02:23:24,275
- Excuse me?
- Of what nature?

2389
02:23:28,530 --> 02:23:31,157
- I have a family.
- We all have families.

2390
02:23:32,659 --> 02:23:37,080
Well, I can speak only for myself
and I must see my wife.

2391
02:23:37,163 --> 02:23:38,623
It's very urgent,

2392
02:23:39,833 --> 02:23:43,753
and I ask only
for a single place on a train.

2393
02:23:43,837 --> 02:23:45,213
But you have a place on the train!

2394
02:23:45,338 --> 02:23:47,340
You have a place
on the train of this revolution.

2395
02:23:47,465 --> 02:23:49,801
You have been like so many others,
the best revolutionaries.

2396
02:23:49,884 --> 02:23:52,220
One of the engineers
on the locomotive of this train

2397
02:23:52,345 --> 02:23:56,182
that pulls this revolution
on the tracks of historical necessity

2398
02:23:56,266 --> 02:23:57,851
laid out for it by the party.

2399
02:23:57,976 --> 02:23:59,811
You can't leave us now.
We can't replace you.

2400
02:23:59,894 --> 02:24:01,604
- What right do you have you to leave...
- I'm not sure.

2401
02:24:01,688 --> 02:24:03,732
To do what? To see your wife?

2402
02:24:03,857 --> 02:24:05,483
Last year at the International Congress

2403
02:24:05,567 --> 02:24:07,193
I learned that my son
was very ill of typhus.

2404
02:24:07,318 --> 02:24:08,820
I didn't go to see my son

2405
02:24:08,945 --> 02:24:12,032
because I knew I was needed
where I was placed by the party.

2406
02:24:12,157 --> 02:24:13,116
What you don't understand is...

2407
02:24:13,241 --> 02:24:15,744
Would you like to abandon this moment
in your life?

2408
02:24:15,869 --> 02:24:17,203
Would you ever get this moment again?

2409
02:24:17,328 --> 02:24:20,415
- I am not abandoning the revolution!
- Comrade Reed, you're a writer.

2410
02:24:20,540 --> 02:24:22,000
People know and respect your work.

2411
02:24:22,083 --> 02:24:25,337
- You speak with authority of feeling.
- Comrade Zinoviev,

2412
02:24:25,420 --> 02:24:26,796
for the past eight weeks,

2413
02:24:26,880 --> 02:24:29,883
I've been completely unable
to communicate with my wife

2414
02:24:30,008 --> 02:24:32,510
or with my comrades
in the United States.

2415
02:24:32,594 --> 02:24:34,346
I need to go back. I would like your help.

2416
02:24:34,471 --> 02:24:38,224
Comrade Reed, you can always go back
to your private responsibilities,

2417
02:24:38,350 --> 02:24:39,309
so can I.

2418
02:24:39,434 --> 02:24:44,189
You can never, never come back
to this moment in history.

2419
02:24:44,939 --> 02:24:45,899
I'm sorry.

2420
02:24:46,024 --> 02:24:48,151
I have no right to tell you
about your own life.

2421
02:24:48,234 --> 02:24:50,278
You know it better than I do.

2422
02:25:13,051 --> 02:25:15,220
Maybe it was impossible
to get out of Russia.

2423
02:25:15,345 --> 02:25:17,639
There was White armies all around,

2424
02:25:17,764 --> 02:25:20,433
so escape was not dreamt of.

2425
02:26:17,073 --> 02:26:19,909
We had a communication from Jack.

2426
02:26:19,993 --> 02:26:23,538
He was in prison in Finland
where he couldn't communicate freely.

2427
02:26:23,663 --> 02:26:26,041
But he got word out to me

2428
02:26:26,416 --> 02:26:28,877
to take a message to Louise.

2429
02:26:29,002 --> 02:26:32,005
And I remember walking over to Louise,
she lived right near me.

2430
02:26:32,297 --> 02:26:35,467
I walked over to Louise's apartment
on Patson Place,

2431
02:26:35,842 --> 02:26:38,803
and spent an evening with her
talking about Jack,

2432
02:26:38,887 --> 02:26:42,974
and she talked very earnestly
about Jack's plight.

2433
02:26:54,861 --> 02:26:57,280
Mrs. Reed, the United States
cannot involve itself

2434
02:26:57,364 --> 02:26:58,823
in the internal affairs of Finland.

2435
02:26:58,907 --> 02:27:00,658
Are you trying to tell me
the American Consul

2436
02:27:00,742 --> 02:27:03,328
- can't give you any information?
- I'm afraid that there's nothing

2437
02:27:03,453 --> 02:27:05,872
- that the State Department can do.
- Don't give me that garbage.

2438
02:27:05,997 --> 02:27:08,375
If his name were Rockefeller,
there'd be something you could do.

2439
02:27:08,458 --> 02:27:10,877
Mrs. Reed, if your husband's name
were Rockefeller,

2440
02:27:10,960 --> 02:27:12,712
I think he would hardly be
under indictment

2441
02:27:12,837 --> 02:27:15,340
for a conspiracy to overthrow
the United States Government.

2442
02:27:15,465 --> 02:27:18,301
He has only one kidney.
He could be dangerously ill.

2443
02:27:18,385 --> 02:27:20,929
That is a chance
that your husband took, Mrs. Reed,

2444
02:27:21,054 --> 02:27:25,225
when he left the United States
without an exit visa or a passport.

2445
02:27:25,350 --> 02:27:27,352
Good day, Mrs. Reed.

2446
02:27:28,311 --> 02:27:30,980
The United States
participated with the Allies

2447
02:27:31,064 --> 02:27:34,067
in military expeditions against
the Soviet Union

2448
02:27:34,192 --> 02:27:37,570
in an attempt to overcome them,
invade them,

2449
02:27:38,488 --> 02:27:41,074
and set up another government.
Oh, yes. Yes.

2450
02:27:41,199 --> 02:27:42,742
There was a noose

2451
02:27:43,201 --> 02:27:46,454
to be pulled around Russia

2452
02:27:46,579 --> 02:27:51,543
which gave you an idea
of how a whole country

2453
02:27:51,626 --> 02:27:56,131
can be surrounded
east, west, south, and north.

2454
02:28:04,806 --> 02:28:07,434
Your name,
and the name of your contact in Finland.

2455
02:28:25,410 --> 02:28:28,079
Your name,
and the name of your contact in Finland.

2456
02:28:28,455 --> 02:28:29,789
I don't know what color...

2457
02:28:30,749 --> 02:28:32,083
I'll just get it myself.

2458
02:28:32,167 --> 02:28:34,627
- Would you get some...
- Would you like us to do it now?

2459
02:28:34,753 --> 02:28:36,129
- Okay.
- Oh, okay.

2460
02:28:36,338 --> 02:28:37,297
- All right.
- I understand.

2461
02:28:37,922 --> 02:28:38,882
From the top?

2462
02:28:39,716 --> 02:28:41,968
Oh, I see. Then they made a map.

2463
02:28:43,428 --> 02:28:44,596
Terry spoke to me.

2464
02:28:44,679 --> 02:28:47,891
Louise, I don't think you realize
how difficult this trip to be for a woman.

2465
02:28:47,974 --> 02:28:49,017
You'd have to stow away.

2466
02:28:49,184 --> 02:28:51,770
If you got there at all,
it would take you six months to...

2467
02:28:51,895 --> 02:28:54,147
Terry said that he thought that
you could arrange a freighter for me

2468
02:28:54,272 --> 02:28:55,940
- as far as Norway.
- Don't know why you're saying it.

2469
02:28:56,024 --> 02:28:57,734
You know what I mean?

2470
02:28:58,151 --> 02:28:59,361
Sit down.

2471
02:29:01,321 --> 02:29:03,865
I want to talk to you about something.

2472
02:29:05,200 --> 02:29:06,159
...indicates the map.

2473
02:29:06,326 --> 02:29:07,827
I could go.

2474
02:29:07,952 --> 02:29:11,331
I can sign on as a seaman.
There'd be no questions asked.

2475
02:29:11,414 --> 02:29:13,458
I think under the circumstances...

2476
02:29:17,170 --> 02:29:20,465
Don't look at me like that.
Jack Reed's a friend of mine.

2477
02:29:20,590 --> 02:29:23,385
I'm not gonna let
the son of a bitch rot in jail.

2478
02:29:23,510 --> 02:29:25,303
Just seemed to me
that I'm not as interested...

2479
02:29:30,225 --> 02:29:32,018
...and at this point...

2480
02:29:32,936 --> 02:29:34,229
Okay.

2481
02:29:34,354 --> 02:29:36,690
Wasn't he supposed to come over
to me on this?

2482
02:29:36,815 --> 02:29:39,192
I'll talk to Terry in the morning.

2483
02:29:39,275 --> 02:29:41,403
Where the cross is made...

2484
02:29:41,528 --> 02:29:43,780
I wish these son-of-a-bitches could act.

2485
02:30:29,534 --> 02:30:31,870
Your blood pressure is very high.

2486
02:30:32,495 --> 02:30:35,248
They only give me
some kind of salted fish.

2487
02:30:35,373 --> 02:30:38,376
The blood in your mouth
is from the gums.

2488
02:30:38,501 --> 02:30:40,045
You have scurvy.

2489
02:30:41,838 --> 02:30:44,341
An impressive shade of red, comrade.

2490
02:30:50,513 --> 02:30:52,223
Could you send a cable to my wife?

2491
02:31:53,243 --> 02:31:56,287
Mr. Reed, I have something for you.

2492
02:32:00,083 --> 02:32:02,794
- Is there a cable?
- There's nothing yet.

2493
02:32:03,378 --> 02:32:07,382
You should take one of these powders
in a glass of water, once a day.

2494
02:32:08,508 --> 02:32:10,427
Has she sent word to me here?

2495
02:32:10,510 --> 02:32:13,638
They won't say.
Our people can find out nothing.

2496
02:32:39,456 --> 02:32:41,082
You are being released.

2497
02:32:45,086 --> 02:32:50,008
You know, I must tell you,
I lost sight of John Reed completely.

2498
02:32:50,675 --> 02:32:52,510
But what I heard was

2499
02:32:52,594 --> 02:32:57,057
the Bolsheviki traded
some Finnish professors

2500
02:32:57,140 --> 02:32:59,601
for the release of John Reed.

2501
02:32:59,726 --> 02:33:01,019
John Reed.

2502
02:33:01,394 --> 02:33:03,521
We are here to welcome you.

2503
02:33:05,482 --> 02:33:07,901
Could you take me
to the telegraph office?

2504
02:33:07,984 --> 02:33:10,028
- Yes. Get in.
- Thank you.

2505
02:33:18,870 --> 02:33:22,874
"Louise Bryant, Croton-on..."

2506
02:33:22,999 --> 02:33:24,459
Hudson.

2507
02:33:24,584 --> 02:33:27,420
"...Hudson, New York, USA.

2508
02:33:27,587 --> 02:33:28,713
"I'm safe. Stop."

2509
02:33:29,005 --> 02:33:30,882
"Please contact..."

2510
02:33:31,383 --> 02:33:33,343
Contact. Please contact.

2511
02:33:33,468 --> 02:33:36,429
"Contact Petrograd telegraph office.
Stop.

2512
02:33:36,513 --> 02:33:38,973

2513
02:33:39,349 --> 02:33:42,602
"Please for... Forgive..."

2514
02:33:42,727 --> 02:33:44,437
Please forgive Christmas.

2515
02:33:44,562 --> 02:33:49,192
"Please forgive Christmas. Stop.
Love, Jack."

2516
02:33:51,736 --> 02:33:52,987
Could you send that right away?

2517
02:33:57,325 --> 02:33:59,828
Comrade Lenin said

2518
02:33:59,953 --> 02:34:04,082
he would trade,
for John Reed, fifty professors.

2519
02:34:05,792 --> 02:34:09,004
"Louise Bryant, Croton-on-Hudson,

- USA.
- "USA. Immediate."

2531
02:34:44,789 --> 02:34:47,125
- "Do not..."
- Do not understand.

2532
02:34:47,208 --> 02:34:52,172

02:35:08,396 --> 02:35:12,650
- "New York, USA."
- Did you check R-E-A-D?

2538
02:35:12,776 --> 02:35:14,069
Yes. Yes.

2539
02:35:14,194 --> 02:35:15,320
And you checked R-E-l-D also?

2540
02:35:15,445 --> 02:35:18,156
I have looked R-E-l-D,

2541
02:35:18,281 --> 02:35:20,116
R-E-A-D,

2542
02:35:20,200 --> 02:35:24,287
R-E-D.
I have looked Goldman and Bryant.

2543
02:35:25,538 --> 02:35:27,248
I'm just... Excuse me. One second.

2544
02:35:28,541 --> 02:35:30,085
Lf, if...

2545
02:35:30,210 --> 02:35:33,505
I thought maybe there's some other way
of misspelling the name.

2546
02:35:33,630 --> 02:35:37,217
- You also looked under R-E-l-D?
- Yes, Comrade Reed.

2547
02:35:37,342 --> 02:35:41,680
- Yes, yes. What do you want?
- There's many people wait.

2548
02:35:41,763 --> 02:35:44,849
- Excuse me.
- Lf something come, we'll notify you.

2549
02:35:50,230 --> 02:35:51,856
What have you heard?

2550
02:35:51,981 --> 02:35:53,817
Not much. What have you heard?

2551
02:35:53,900 --> 02:35:56,861
I don't hear. I wait.
They've jailed more anarchists.

2552
02:35:56,945 --> 02:35:59,823
But they made Bill Shatoff
head of the Siberian railway.

2553
02:36:00,448 --> 02:36:03,618
They treated me very well,
and I'm reserving my judgment.

2554
02:36:03,743 --> 02:36:07,163
- Well, that's wise.
- There's so much I don't understand.

2555
02:36:07,288 --> 02:36:08,873
There are forests within easy reach
of Petrograd.

2556
02:36:08,998 --> 02:36:10,583
Why is this city freezing?

2557
02:36:10,709 --> 02:36:12,085
I asked Zinoviev.

2558
02:36:12,210 --> 02:36:14,671
He said our enemies have destroyed
all the means of transportation

2559
02:36:14,796 --> 02:36:16,381
and killed off our horses
as well as our men.

2560
02:36:16,506 --> 02:36:17,507
How would we get at it?

2561
02:36:17,590 --> 02:36:19,092
I said, "What about
the people of Petrograd?

2562
02:36:19,175 --> 02:36:21,803
"They could go there together on foot
and haul the wood back with ropes."

2563
02:36:21,928 --> 02:36:23,430
He said, "Oh, yes, it would make
the people warmer,

2564
02:36:23,555 --> 02:36:26,224
"but it would interfere with the carrying
out of the main political policy."

2565
02:36:26,349 --> 02:36:29,060
- You get letters from America, E. G?
- Oh, yes.

2566
02:36:29,185 --> 02:36:32,814
All opened by the Justice Department.
I hope they enjoy what they read. I don't.

2567
02:36:32,939 --> 02:36:35,275
So I asked him,
"What are the main political policies?"

2568
02:36:35,400 --> 02:36:38,069
He said,
"Concentration of all power in the hands

2569
02:36:38,153 --> 02:36:39,696
"of the proletarian avant-garde.

2570
02:36:39,779 --> 02:36:43,825
"The avant-garde of the revolution,
which is the Communist Party."

2571
02:36:44,284 --> 02:36:46,828
Anybody mention Louise?

2572
02:36:46,953 --> 02:36:49,831
I don't think so.
You haven't heard from her?

2573
02:36:50,331 --> 02:36:53,209
I've sent her cables,
but I don't get any answer.

2574
02:36:53,293 --> 02:36:55,795
- For how long?
- A long time.

2575
02:36:56,796 --> 02:36:57,964
Wait.

2576
02:36:58,089 --> 02:37:00,925
Rhys Williams
mentioned her in his letter.

2577
02:37:01,009 --> 02:37:03,345
He hasn't heard from her, either.

2578
02:37:03,470 --> 02:37:04,596
What'd he say?

2579
02:37:05,972 --> 02:37:09,225
I think he said
that he'd tried to reach her

2580
02:37:09,309 --> 02:37:12,437
sometime after Christmas,
but she'd left New York.

2581
02:37:16,149 --> 02:37:18,234
How long ago was that?

2582
02:37:18,318 --> 02:37:20,779
Well, you know how these letters take
a couple of months to get here.

2583
02:37:20,862 --> 02:37:25,700
By the time I get them, whoever sent it
is either in jail or deported.

2584
02:37:25,825 --> 02:37:27,494
- That's it.
- Which?

2585
02:37:27,619 --> 02:37:28,995
- There.
- Rhys Williams.

2586
02:37:29,454 --> 02:37:30,413
Oh.

2587
02:37:31,831 --> 02:37:34,501
- First the eyes go, then the legs.
- Yeah.

2588
02:37:35,251 --> 02:37:37,962
Yeah, I don't understand
the fuel situation, either.

2589
02:37:39,589 --> 02:37:41,633
I don't know...

2590
02:37:45,679 --> 02:37:48,181
He says she seems to be out of town.

2591
02:37:48,264 --> 02:37:49,599
That's all he said?

2592
02:37:51,059 --> 02:37:52,143
Yeah.

2593
02:37:52,727 --> 02:37:54,771
What did he say about O'Neill?

2594
02:37:54,854 --> 02:37:56,481
O'Neill? Nothing.

2595
02:37:56,981 --> 02:37:58,692
Come on, what did he say?

2596
02:37:59,901 --> 02:38:01,194
Nothing.

2597
02:38:01,319 --> 02:38:02,737
Can I see it?

2598
02:38:08,910 --> 02:38:10,203
I'm sorry.

2599
02:38:18,461 --> 02:38:20,630
I just don't know where...

2600
02:38:24,384 --> 02:38:26,553
Jack, sit down.

2601
02:38:38,231 --> 02:38:40,066
If Louise were to come here,

2602
02:38:40,191 --> 02:38:42,610
she'd have to leave
the United States illegally,

2603
02:38:42,736 --> 02:38:44,988
then live in exile with you,
and never go home again.

2604
02:38:46,031 --> 02:38:49,325
All for the sake of a revolution
she was never any part of.

2605
02:38:49,409 --> 02:38:51,202
Why should she?

2606
02:38:51,870 --> 02:38:54,330
You chose the life of a revolutionary.

2607
02:38:54,414 --> 02:38:55,749
She didn't.

2608
02:38:56,624 --> 02:39:01,212
Your cables only focus the
Justice Department's attention on her,

2609
02:39:01,338 --> 02:39:03,882
and the most seditious thing
they can accuse her of

2610
02:39:04,007 --> 02:39:05,717
is being your wife.

2611
02:39:06,718 --> 02:39:08,845
Leave her alone.

2612
02:39:08,928 --> 02:39:10,722
Let her choose her own future.

2613
02:39:11,931 --> 02:39:14,059
Why hasn't she answered me?

2614
02:39:14,142 --> 02:39:15,977
I think she has answered you.

2615
02:41:32,322 --> 02:41:35,533
He's been released.
They won't tell me where he is.

2616
02:41:57,806 --> 02:42:01,101
Do you know, she was much hated

2617
02:42:01,226 --> 02:42:03,353
for her extravagance in clothes.

2618
02:42:03,436 --> 02:42:07,816
Well, a long time ago,
somebody said to me,

2619
02:42:09,275 --> 02:42:10,276
"People who...

2620
02:42:10,402 --> 02:42:13,279
"Women whose lives
have been in danger

2621
02:42:13,655 --> 02:42:17,117
"over a long period
are always the most extravagant."

2622
02:42:17,617 --> 02:42:20,370
Comrades, as wrong-headed
as many of its policies are,

2623
02:42:20,453 --> 02:42:22,872
the IWW is a revolutionary union

2624
02:42:22,956 --> 02:42:24,999
and the American Federation of Labor
is not.

2625
02:42:25,125 --> 02:42:28,128
To think we can infiltrate
the American Federation of Labor

2626
02:42:28,253 --> 02:42:30,463
and convert it
to revolutionary policies is hopeless.

2627
02:42:30,588 --> 02:42:31,715
Translation.

2628
02:42:34,634 --> 02:42:37,220
Comrades, that's the wrong translation.

2629
02:42:44,936 --> 02:42:46,688
That's not what he said.

2630
02:42:47,313 --> 02:42:48,440
What's he saying?

2631
02:42:48,982 --> 02:42:51,026
For us to make a point
on the floor of the Congress,

2632
02:42:51,151 --> 02:42:52,694
we have to go

2633
02:42:52,819 --> 02:42:55,530
from our own English language
into the official German language

2634
02:42:55,655 --> 02:42:58,241
to the Italian, or Spanish,
or French language.

2635
02:42:58,324 --> 02:43:02,120
- And then, when the response from...
- What is your question, please?

2636
02:43:02,203 --> 02:43:04,622
Simply for the labor union issue,

2637
02:43:04,706 --> 02:43:07,167
could we have the English language
as an official language

2638
02:43:07,250 --> 02:43:09,169
on the floor of the Congress?

2639
02:43:11,629 --> 02:43:14,799
Comrade Reed, this is the third time
you have raised this proposal!

2640
02:43:14,883 --> 02:43:16,051
The issue has been decided.

2641
02:43:16,176 --> 02:43:18,470
We must move on
to the national and colonial issues!

2642
02:43:23,183 --> 02:43:25,894
Real revolutionary workers
in the United States

2643
02:43:26,019 --> 02:43:29,147
quit the AF of L a long time ago

2644
02:43:29,230 --> 02:43:31,274
and joined the IWW.

2645
02:43:31,358 --> 02:43:33,610
We have to make
the Russians understand this,

2646
02:43:33,693 --> 02:43:36,446
and that's why we want your support

2647
02:43:36,529 --> 02:43:41,409
to extend the session of congress
and to keep the debate open.

2648
02:43:52,587 --> 02:43:54,047
Jack, are you okay?

2649
02:43:54,130 --> 02:43:55,882
- Did you talk to Sadoul?
- Yes, I did.

2650
02:43:56,007 --> 02:43:59,344
Comrades, I'm still opposed to closing
the discussion here.

2651
02:43:59,427 --> 02:44:01,888
I think that this discussion
is being closed

2652
02:44:01,971 --> 02:44:05,183
to avoid hearing the American
and the British delegations.

2653
02:44:05,308 --> 02:44:07,560
And if for no other reason than that,

2654
02:44:07,686 --> 02:44:09,646
it shows that discussion
should continue.

2655
02:44:09,729 --> 02:44:12,023
Comrade Radek
uses this sort of remark

2656
02:44:12,107 --> 02:44:15,110
in place of an argument and as a result,
he doesn't want to talk about it.

2657
02:44:15,235 --> 02:44:19,864
What Reed says is not distinguished
by excessive fear of distorting the truth.

2658
02:44:19,948 --> 02:44:22,367
He goes on day and night
and has the cheek to claim

2659
02:44:22,450 --> 02:44:24,202
that the discussion is being broken off

2660
02:44:24,285 --> 02:44:26,746
because of fear of the great might
of John Reed.

2661
02:44:43,596 --> 02:44:46,641
Comrade Reed, you may have time
to discuss it until tomorrow morning.

2662
02:44:46,766 --> 02:44:48,101
Other people do not have the time.

2663
02:44:48,226 --> 02:44:51,896
Comrade Radek, other people that
don't have the time for this discussion

2664
02:44:52,022 --> 02:44:55,108
are 101 leaders of the IWW

2665
02:44:55,233 --> 02:44:57,068
who are in jail today
in the United States

2666
02:44:57,193 --> 02:44:58,987
because of their revolutionary views.

2667
02:44:59,112 --> 02:45:02,032
And if we turn our back
on these comrades

2668
02:45:02,115 --> 02:45:05,827
out of some pipe dream to radicalize
the American Federation of Labor

2669
02:45:05,952 --> 02:45:07,078
which cannot be done, it is a disgrace.

2670
02:45:07,203 --> 02:45:09,789
We've discussed this
during six sessions of this commission.

2671
02:45:09,914 --> 02:45:11,541
We spent whole day today discussing it,

2672
02:45:11,624 --> 02:45:13,835
and you insinuate
we are trying to dismiss the issue?

2673
02:45:19,549 --> 02:45:21,301
We haven't had enough discussion...

2674
02:45:21,426 --> 02:45:23,803
We haven't had enough discussion
for my friend here

2675
02:45:23,928 --> 02:45:27,432
to realize that Louis Fraina and I
think alike on this problem.

2676
02:45:27,557 --> 02:45:29,267
Every American on our delegation,

2677
02:45:29,351 --> 02:45:31,936
- every man on the English delegation...
- You are a member of this committee.

2678
02:45:32,062 --> 02:45:33,563
You are not
an independent political party.

2679
02:45:33,688 --> 02:45:36,983
Comrade Zinoviev, I will not be
steamrollered by this committee

2680
02:45:37,108 --> 02:45:39,944
that has not had
a proper education on this problem.

2681
02:45:40,028 --> 02:45:41,571
On the fact...

2682
02:45:49,412 --> 02:45:50,747
The discussion is closed.

2683
02:45:50,830 --> 02:45:53,541
However, if Comrade Reed
wishes to make a statement,

2684
02:45:53,666 --> 02:45:55,960
he will have two minutes to do so.

2685
02:45:56,586 --> 02:46:00,048
I would merely want to say that
on behalf of the American delegates,

2686
02:46:00,173 --> 02:46:02,550
that we will refuse
to vote on these theses,

2687
02:46:02,676 --> 02:46:06,304
and that I myself
will resign my seat on this committee.

2688
02:47:11,870 --> 02:47:13,788
Jack, I think we have to face it.

2689
02:47:13,913 --> 02:47:17,000
The dream that we had
is dying in Russia.

2690
02:47:17,083 --> 02:47:19,586
If Bolshevism means
the peasants taking the land,

2691
02:47:19,669 --> 02:47:21,087
the workers taking the factories,

2692
02:47:21,212 --> 02:47:24,549
Russia's one place
where there's no Bolshevism.

2693
02:47:24,674 --> 02:47:28,219
You know, I can argue with cops,
I can fight with generals.

2694
02:47:28,303 --> 02:47:30,263
I can't deal with a bureaucrat.

2695
02:47:30,388 --> 02:47:33,016
You think Zinoviev is nothing worse
than a bureaucrat?

2696
02:47:33,516 --> 02:47:35,560
The Soviets have no more
local autonomy.

2697
02:47:35,685 --> 02:47:37,354
The central state has all the power.

2698
02:47:37,437 --> 02:47:39,189
All the power
is in the hands of a few men

2699
02:47:39,272 --> 02:47:40,940
and they are destroying the revolution.

2700
02:47:41,066 --> 02:47:44,319
They are destroying any hope
of real Communism in Russia.

2701
02:47:44,444 --> 02:47:46,988
They're putting people like me in jail.

2702
02:47:47,113 --> 02:47:49,157
My understanding of revolution

2703
02:47:49,282 --> 02:47:52,369
is not a continual extermination
of political dissenters,

2704
02:47:52,452 --> 02:47:54,454
and I want no part of it.

2705
02:47:55,121 --> 02:47:57,290
Every single newspaper's
been shut down

2706
02:47:57,415 --> 02:47:58,750
or taken over by the party.

2707
02:47:58,875 --> 02:48:01,920
Anyone even vaguely suspected
of being a counter-revolutionary

2708
02:48:02,003 --> 02:48:05,465
can be taken out and shot
without a trial. Where does that end?

2709
02:48:05,590 --> 02:48:07,926
Is any nightmare justifiable

2710
02:48:08,009 --> 02:48:10,887
in the name of defense
against counter-revolution?

2711
02:48:10,970 --> 02:48:12,931
The dream may be dying in Russia,
but I'm not.

2712
02:48:13,014 --> 02:48:15,600
It may take some time. I'm getting out.

2713
02:48:15,725 --> 02:48:18,520
You sound like you're a little confused
by the revolution in action, E.G.

2714
02:48:18,645 --> 02:48:20,939
Up to now,
you've only dealt with it in theory.

2715
02:48:21,022 --> 02:48:22,273
What did you think
this thing was gonna be?

2716
02:48:22,399 --> 02:48:23,858
A revolution by consensus

2717
02:48:23,983 --> 02:48:26,403
where we all sat down
and agreed over a cup of coffee?

2718
02:48:26,486 --> 02:48:28,655
Nothing works.

2719
02:48:28,780 --> 02:48:30,782
Four million people died last year.

2720
02:48:30,907 --> 02:48:32,075
Not from fighting a war,

2721
02:48:32,158 --> 02:48:35,036
they died from starvation and typhus
in a militaristic police state

2722
02:48:35,161 --> 02:48:36,663
that suppresses
freedom and human rights

2723
02:48:36,788 --> 02:48:37,914
where nothing works.

2724
02:48:37,997 --> 02:48:40,542
They died because of a
French, British and American blockade

2725
02:48:40,667 --> 02:48:43,003
that cut off
all food and medical supplies

2726
02:48:43,128 --> 02:48:45,213
and because counter-revolutionaries
have sabotaged the factories

2727
02:48:45,338 --> 02:48:48,299
and the railroads and the telephones,
and because the people,

2728
02:48:48,383 --> 02:48:51,094
the poor, ignorant,
superstitious, illiterate people,

2729
02:48:51,177 --> 02:48:54,472
are trying to run things themselves,
just as you always said that they should,

2730
02:48:54,556 --> 02:48:55,640
but they don't know
how to run them yet.

2731
02:48:55,765 --> 02:48:57,851
Did you really think things would work
right away?

2732
02:48:58,018 --> 02:49:00,061
Did you really expect
social transformation

2733
02:49:00,186 --> 02:49:02,313
to be anything other than
a murderous process?

2734
02:49:02,439 --> 02:49:05,358
It's a war, E.G.,
and we gotta fight it like we fight a war,

2735
02:49:05,483 --> 02:49:07,527
with discipline,
with terror, with firing squads,

2736
02:49:07,652 --> 02:49:09,612
or we just give it up.

2737
02:49:09,738 --> 02:49:12,115
Those four million people
didn't die fighting a war.

2738
02:49:12,198 --> 02:49:14,909
They died from a system
that cannot work!

2739
02:49:23,960 --> 02:49:25,920
It's just the beginning, E.G.

2740
02:49:26,713 --> 02:49:29,341
It's not happening
the way we thought it would.

2741
02:49:29,466 --> 02:49:31,176
It's not happening
the way we wanted it to,

2742
02:49:31,259 --> 02:49:32,719
but it's happening.

2743
02:49:37,349 --> 02:49:39,267
If you walk out on it now,

2744
02:49:39,684 --> 02:49:41,853
what's your whole life meant?

2745
02:49:46,399 --> 02:49:49,194
Could you tell me if my resignation
is ready for signature yet?

2746
02:49:49,277 --> 02:49:50,528
- It is.
- Good.

2747
02:49:50,612 --> 02:49:52,197
May I see it?

2748
02:49:53,365 --> 02:49:54,657
Thank you.

2749
02:50:01,081 --> 02:50:03,708
- Thank you, Comrade Reed.
- Welcome back, Comrade Reed.

2750
02:50:03,792 --> 02:50:06,211
Now you'll be able to represent
the American workers

2751
02:50:06,294 --> 02:50:07,671
at the forthcoming congress at Baku

2752
02:50:07,754 --> 02:50:11,341
to inspire revolution among the peoples
of the Middle East.

2753
02:50:11,424 --> 02:50:12,425
Prepare for a difficult trip.

2754
02:50:12,550 --> 02:50:14,552
Our only route
is through divided territory.

2755
02:50:55,427 --> 02:50:59,014
Some of these intellectuals
spread rumors

2756
02:50:59,139 --> 02:51:01,808
that he changed his mind afterwards,

2757
02:51:01,933 --> 02:51:03,768
trying to, you know,

2758
02:51:07,022 --> 02:51:10,150
show that he came to his senses.

2759
02:51:11,484 --> 02:51:13,778
It's preposterous.

2760
02:51:14,154 --> 02:51:18,199
These men, well,
I don't even remember them.

2761
02:51:18,616 --> 02:51:20,827
I don't want to remember them.

2762
02:54:17,837 --> 02:54:20,632
All trains to Baku canceled
because of attacks

2763
02:54:20,757 --> 02:54:22,008
by counter-revolutionaries.

2764
02:54:22,133 --> 02:54:23,385
There must be some train to Baku.

2765
02:54:25,470 --> 02:54:26,930
All trains to Baku canceled

2766
02:54:27,055 --> 02:54:29,391
because of attacks
by counter-revolutionaries.

2767
02:54:30,392 --> 02:54:33,269
There has to be something to Baku.

2768
02:54:35,063 --> 02:54:36,314
Louise?

2769
02:54:39,943 --> 02:54:41,111
Emma?

2770
02:54:41,528 --> 02:54:42,612
Emma.

2771
02:54:43,697 --> 02:54:44,781
Emma.

2772
02:54:47,033 --> 02:54:50,370
How in the name of God
did you get into Russia?

2773
02:54:52,497 --> 02:54:55,333
- I had no idea how long it would take.
- So, you'll wait for a while.

2774
02:54:56,501 --> 02:54:59,921
By the time you got there,
he'd be back here anyway.

2775
02:55:00,046 --> 02:55:01,506
Go on in. Go on in.

2776
02:55:01,589 --> 02:55:03,258
Oh, I'm sorry.

2777
02:55:03,383 --> 02:55:05,927
It's all right. It's all right.

2778
02:55:10,890 --> 02:55:14,102
Here. Louise, sit down. Sit down.

2779
02:55:24,070 --> 02:55:26,281
I want to tell you something.

2780
02:55:28,324 --> 02:55:29,951
It's late, I know.

2781
02:55:34,581 --> 02:55:36,458
I want to thank you for that scarf.

2782
02:55:37,584 --> 02:55:38,835
Oh, yes.

2783
02:55:40,086 --> 02:55:41,880
I was wrong about you.

2784
02:55:42,714 --> 02:55:43,923
So was I.

2785
02:55:46,426 --> 02:55:48,970
The American oil companies
are trying to establish

2786
02:55:49,095 --> 02:55:50,680
a world monopoly of oil.

2787
02:55:53,433 --> 02:55:58,313
In 1898, the Filipinos rebelled against
the cruel colonial government of Spain.

2788
02:56:01,691 --> 02:56:04,194
But after the Spaniards
had been driven out...

2789
02:56:22,754 --> 02:56:26,091
The Americans have promised
the Filipinos independence.

2790
02:56:26,216 --> 02:56:29,928
Soon an independent Filipino republic
will be proclaimed.

2791
02:56:34,307 --> 02:56:37,811
The government of United States
sent soldiers and sailors there...

2792
02:56:40,814 --> 02:56:44,693
...under a dictatorship
worse than the British tyrants.

2793
02:56:53,201 --> 02:56:54,619
What's that for?

2794
02:56:54,703 --> 02:56:57,205
They are supporting you
for your call for a holy war

2795
02:56:57,330 --> 02:57:00,083
of Islamic people against
the western infidels.

2796
02:57:21,229 --> 02:57:22,689
Excuse me, Comrade Reed.

2797
02:57:22,856 --> 02:57:25,525
They said you are not happy
with the translations of your speech.

2798
02:57:25,650 --> 02:57:27,068
I did the German into Turkic

2799
02:57:27,193 --> 02:57:29,404
and Comrade Ossinsky
did the Russian into German.

2800
02:57:29,529 --> 02:57:32,032
Russian?

2801
02:57:32,157 --> 02:57:33,783
Who turned it into Russian
in the first place?

2802
02:57:33,867 --> 02:57:35,326
Well, I don't know.

2803
02:57:35,410 --> 02:57:37,162
They were already in Russian
when we got them

2804
02:57:37,245 --> 02:57:38,788
from the office of Comrade Zinoviev.

2805
02:57:41,124 --> 02:57:43,084
- I'm sorry for my English.
- Your English is fine, comrade.

2806
02:57:50,508 --> 02:57:53,928
Zinoviev, did you do
the translations of my speech?

2807
02:57:54,637 --> 02:57:56,306
I supervised it. Yes.

2808
02:57:56,431 --> 02:57:59,184
I didn't say "holy war."
I said "class war."

2809
02:57:59,309 --> 02:58:01,644
I took a liberty
of altering a phrase or two.

2810
02:58:02,103 --> 02:58:05,273
Yes, well, I don't allow people
to take those liberties with what I write.

2811
02:58:05,899 --> 02:58:08,943
Aren't you propagandist enough
to utilize what moves people most?

2812
02:58:09,069 --> 02:58:11,488
I'm propagandist enough
to utilize the truth.

2813
02:58:11,571 --> 02:58:15,200
And who defines this truth?
You or the party?

2814
02:58:15,283 --> 02:58:16,618
Is your life dedicated to speaking for...

2815
02:58:16,743 --> 02:58:18,870
You don't talk about what
my life is dedicated to!

2816
02:58:18,953 --> 02:58:21,539
Your life? You haven't resolved
what your life is dedicated to.

2817
02:58:21,623 --> 02:58:24,584
You see yourself as an artist
and at the same time as a revolutionary.

2818
02:58:24,709 --> 02:58:27,420
As a lover to your wife, but also as a
spokesman for the American classes.

2819
02:58:27,545 --> 02:58:29,381
Zinoviev, you don't think
a man can be an individual

2820
02:58:29,464 --> 02:58:30,965
and be true to the collective,

2821
02:58:31,091 --> 02:58:34,427
or speak for his own country
and the International at the same time,

2822
02:58:34,552 --> 02:58:37,597
or love his wife
and still be faithful to the revolution,

2823
02:58:37,722 --> 02:58:38,848
you don't have a self to give!

2824
02:58:38,932 --> 02:58:40,809
Would you ever be willing
to give yourself to this revolution?

2825
02:58:40,934 --> 02:58:42,727
When you separate a man
from what he loves the most,

2826
02:58:42,811 --> 02:58:45,271
what you do is purge
what's unique in him.

2827
02:58:45,397 --> 02:58:47,440
And when you purge
what's unique in him,

2828
02:58:47,565 --> 02:58:49,484
- you purge dissent.
- Comrade Reed.

2829
02:58:49,609 --> 02:58:52,028
And when you purge dissent,
you kill the revolution!

2830
02:58:52,112 --> 02:58:53,571
Revolution is dissent!

2831
02:58:53,655 --> 02:58:55,657
- Comrade Reed.
- You don't rewrite what I write!

2832
02:59:03,373 --> 02:59:05,875
Comrade Reed, counter-revolutionaries!

2833
02:59:06,418 --> 02:59:09,087
Counter-revolutionaries,
Comrade Reed!

2834
03:01:42,949 --> 03:01:44,159
Papa!

2835
03:01:46,953 --> 03:01:48,371
Papa!

2836
03:03:59,919 --> 03:04:01,379
Don't leave me.

2837
03:04:04,257 --> 03:04:05,675
Please don't leave me.

2838
03:04:20,940 --> 03:04:24,986
Comrade, the doctor
would like to see you now.

2839
03:04:39,751 --> 03:04:42,712
The doctor thinks
that we must do more analysis.

2840
03:04:42,796 --> 03:04:45,840
And a picture of his illness
will be clearer in a few days.

2841
03:04:45,965 --> 03:04:47,217
And he wants you to know

2842
03:04:47,300 --> 03:04:50,011
that we shall do the best conditions
for Comrade Reed

2843
03:04:50,136 --> 03:04:52,514
to prevent possibility
of high blood pressure

2844
03:04:52,639 --> 03:04:53,598
to cause a stroke.

2845
03:05:08,738 --> 03:05:11,866
I really... I know...

2846
03:05:13,201 --> 03:05:14,244
What?

2847
03:05:15,662 --> 03:05:17,080
How are you?

2848
03:05:21,418 --> 03:05:22,377
No.

2849
03:05:23,003 --> 03:05:24,045
Jack?

2850
03:05:47,986 --> 03:05:51,823
You know, I don't... I don't...

2851
03:06:00,957 --> 03:06:02,334
You hear it?

2852
03:06:03,168 --> 03:06:04,878
- Huh?
- What was that?

2853
03:06:05,670 --> 03:06:07,797
The water plays little songs.

2854
03:06:24,898 --> 03:06:28,193
It's not December, is it?

2855
03:06:46,252 --> 03:06:47,837
My, my, my, my.

2856
03:07:00,100 --> 03:07:02,936
God. What a time it was, huh?

2857
03:07:19,077 --> 03:07:21,371
- Want to come to New York with me?
- New York?

2858
03:07:21,746 --> 03:07:22,956
I got a taxi waiting.

2859
03:07:26,376 --> 03:07:28,086
I wouldn't mind.

2860
03:07:30,630 --> 03:07:32,173
What as?

2861
03:07:33,299 --> 03:07:34,467
What as?

2862
03:07:36,428 --> 03:07:37,595
What as?

2863
03:07:40,098 --> 03:07:41,766
Gee, I don't know.

2864
03:07:50,066 --> 03:07:51,192
Comrades?

2865
03:07:57,532 --> 03:07:58,783
Comrades.

2866
03:08:04,330 --> 03:08:06,166
Well, I want to go home.

2867
03:08:11,880 --> 03:08:12,922
Yeah.

2868
03:08:52,170 --> 03:08:53,672
I'll get you some water.

2869
03:10:37,275 --> 03:10:39,277
Oh, God.

2870
03:12:04,946 --> 03:12:06,698
It was in the afternoon,

2871
03:12:06,823 --> 03:12:09,909
sometime in the fall, I think.

2872
03:12:10,285 --> 03:12:11,870
October, I think.

2873
03:12:12,746 --> 03:12:14,664
Somebody came to tell me

2874
03:12:15,331 --> 03:12:17,042
that Jack Reed died.

2875
03:12:17,542 --> 03:12:20,503
You can imagine how...

2876
03:12:23,757 --> 03:12:25,425
How I felt.

2877
03:12:29,012 --> 03:12:31,056
I'd forgotten all about them.

2878
03:12:31,264 --> 03:12:33,016
Were they socialists?

2879
03:12:35,018 --> 03:12:37,395
Many of them were idealists.

2880
03:12:38,813 --> 03:12:42,400
You know,
things go and come back again.

2881
03:12:44,277 --> 03:12:47,572
I don't know what the outside world
thought of them,

2882
03:12:47,781 --> 03:12:50,075
but they were a couple.

2883
03:12:50,158 --> 03:12:53,828
I mean, you always spoke
of Louise Bryant and Jack Reed.

2884
03:12:56,206 --> 03:12:59,125
He was just a man in the prime of life.

2885
03:13:00,251 --> 03:13:03,296
I don't even know.
Did they ever have any children?

2886
03:13:04,506 --> 03:13:06,925
They probably didn't have any children,

2887
03:13:07,258 --> 03:13:08,718
he and Louise.

2888
03:13:11,388 --> 03:13:14,349
Again, you can't tell,
when you have children,

2889
03:13:15,308 --> 03:13:19,145
whether they will carry on
your revolutionary tradition or not.

2890
03:13:22,607 --> 03:13:24,484
Why did he do it?

2891
03:13:24,818 --> 03:13:27,779
Well, it's impossible to say

2892
03:13:27,904 --> 03:13:29,322
why Edison invented,

2893
03:13:29,447 --> 03:13:33,118
or why Galli-Curci sang...

2894
03:13:33,660 --> 03:13:37,497
He was definitely a stirrer-up of people.

2895
03:13:38,373 --> 03:13:40,083
That was his field.

2896
03:13:41,292 --> 03:13:43,878
That's what he came to do, apparently.

2897
03:13:45,171 --> 03:13:50,093
He's well-known amongst a few,
but not everybody.

2898
03:13:50,385 --> 03:13:52,929
They don't know who in heck he is.

2899
03:13:54,472 --> 03:13:58,143
I look for myself to die any day.

2900
03:14:02,731 --> 03:14:05,108
He was asked by Lenin,
"Are you an American?"

2901
03:14:06,067 --> 03:14:07,027
He said, "Yes."

2902
03:14:07,152 --> 03:14:09,821
And Lenin said,
"An American American?"

2903
03:14:10,947 --> 03:14:12,449
And Reed said, "Yes."

2904
03:14:15,243 --> 03:14:19,622
Of course,
nobody goes with the idea of dying.

2905
03:14:19,706 --> 03:14:22,667
Everybody wants to live.

2906
03:14:24,711 --> 03:14:28,173
I don't remember his exact words,

2907
03:14:28,256 --> 03:14:30,133
but the meaning was

2908
03:14:31,259 --> 03:14:35,180
that grand things are ahead,

2909
03:14:37,557 --> 03:14:41,770
worth living and worth dying for.

2910
03:14:42,354 --> 03:14:44,939
He himself said that.
