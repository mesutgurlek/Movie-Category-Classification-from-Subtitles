1
00:01:17,547 --> 00:01:19,799
24, 26.

2
00:01:19,883 --> 00:01:21,008
Oh, my God.

3
00:01:21,093 --> 00:01:24,303
Joni, there are so many hotties
in your class.

4
00:01:25,138 --> 00:01:27,473
You are so gonna hook up
the first week.

5
00:01:27,557 --> 00:01:30,351
Just because you're a 24-hour drive-thru
doesn't mean everyone else has to be.

6
00:01:30,435 --> 00:01:32,269
Hey,
she worked her ass off.

7
00:01:32,354 --> 00:01:35,856
She deserves
some hot jock sausage.

8
00:01:35,941 --> 00:01:37,566
Gross.
That's disgusting.

9
00:01:38,694 --> 00:01:41,153
Why don't you guys just do it and
get it over with?

10
00:01:43,532 --> 00:01:45,074
What? I'm just saying.

11
00:01:46,451 --> 00:01:48,160
Maybe because
we're friends.

12
00:01:50,163 --> 00:01:51,956
B minus
in geometry, dude.

13
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,291
This shit is the bomb.

14
00:01:59,464 --> 00:02:00,840
Add that shit up.

15
00:02:00,924 --> 00:02:03,050
Don't be
such a bitch, dude.

16
00:02:06,888 --> 00:02:07,972
Yeah.

17
00:02:12,561 --> 00:02:15,479
Hey, ladies! Come on,
take it down a notch.

18
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:19,358
Hey! Hey!
What did I just say, huh?

19
00:02:19,443 --> 00:02:22,570
Come here. Come here, big boy.
Let's see what you got.

20
00:02:22,654 --> 00:02:23,988
Come on, get him!

21
00:02:24,656 --> 00:02:27,074
Come on, what you got?
Let's see it. Come on.

22
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:29,702
Come on, Dad. Your pits smell
like burnt ass.

23
00:02:30,495 --> 00:02:31,662
Burnt ass?
Yeah.

24
00:02:34,291 --> 00:02:36,917
Get out of here.
Take it to his house.

25
00:02:51,641 --> 00:02:54,560
Laser, cut it out.
That's driving me crazy.

26
00:02:54,644 --> 00:02:55,853
I'm not doing anything.
Calm down.

27
00:02:55,937 --> 00:02:57,521
You calm down.

28
00:02:57,939 --> 00:02:59,148
Hi, guys.

29
00:02:59,232 --> 00:03:00,441
Hey, babe.

30
00:03:00,525 --> 00:03:02,443
Hey, Mom.
Sorry I'm late.

31
00:03:02,527 --> 00:03:03,861
No, don't worry.
We just started.

32
00:03:04,529 --> 00:03:05,613
Come on.
That's enough.

33
00:03:05,697 --> 00:03:08,449
Oh, my God.
27 fibroids.

34
00:03:08,533 --> 00:03:09,867
All in the lining.

35
00:03:09,951 --> 00:03:11,160
That's disgusting.

36
00:03:11,244 --> 00:03:13,162
Yeah.
We're eating.

37
00:03:14,706 --> 00:03:16,957
Wow. Did they do that
laparoscopically?

38
00:03:17,042 --> 00:03:19,376
That's right, smart girl.
We got them all.

39
00:03:19,461 --> 00:03:21,045
Hey, whose truck is that?

40
00:03:21,129 --> 00:03:22,463
Mine.

41
00:03:23,423 --> 00:03:24,507
Yours?

42
00:03:24,591 --> 00:03:26,133
Isn't it wicked?

43
00:03:26,218 --> 00:03:27,218
Mmm-hmm.

44
00:03:27,594 --> 00:03:29,512
For the business.

45
00:03:29,596 --> 00:03:31,096
What business?

46
00:03:33,433 --> 00:03:35,267
Oh, you mean
the gardening?

47
00:03:36,645 --> 00:03:38,062
Isn't it landscape design?

48
00:03:38,146 --> 00:03:40,314
Thank you very much.

49
00:03:40,398 --> 00:03:42,983
I got a great deal.
It was super cheap.

50
00:03:43,068 --> 00:03:46,153
Okay. Do we have any
more of the Fiddlehead?

51
00:03:46,238 --> 00:03:48,864
I don't know.
I didn't look, honey.

52
00:03:52,911 --> 00:03:54,495
Hey, what's up?
Yo, what's up, dude?

53
00:03:54,579 --> 00:03:56,288
Laser, no phone calls
at the table, all right?

54
00:03:56,373 --> 00:03:58,499
Dude, I shaved my dog.

55
00:03:58,583 --> 00:03:59,667
Are you still feeling it?

56
00:03:59,751 --> 00:04:00,835
Yeah. Hey,
let me hit you back.

57
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:02,002
For sure.

58
00:04:02,087 --> 00:04:03,504
Who's that?

59
00:04:03,588 --> 00:04:06,006
That was nobody.
Just Clay.

60
00:04:08,635 --> 00:04:10,219
Can I ask you something?

61
00:04:10,303 --> 00:04:13,848
What do you get from your relationship
with Clay?

62
00:04:13,932 --> 00:04:15,182
What do you mean "get"?

63
00:04:15,267 --> 00:04:18,519
Well, we just feel like
he's a little untended.

64
00:04:18,603 --> 00:04:22,773
Do you think he's the kind of person
who's gonna help you grow?

65
00:04:23,525 --> 00:04:27,319
Hey, did you get started on those
thank-you notes for the birthday presents?

66
00:04:27,404 --> 00:04:28,779
Mom, you're windshield wiping.
Come on.

67
00:04:28,864 --> 00:04:30,197
Not yet, but I will.
Okay.

68
00:04:30,282 --> 00:04:32,366
I just think it's better to knock them out
when it's fresh.

69
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:34,451
Yeah, I'll do
them tonight.

70
00:04:34,536 --> 00:04:37,538
I mean, you don't want to have to start with
an apology. You know?

71
00:04:37,622 --> 00:04:38,873
Then it's embarrassing.

72
00:04:38,957 --> 00:04:40,708
Mom, I know.

73
00:04:40,792 --> 00:04:42,209
It's okay, honey.
She got it.

74
00:04:42,294 --> 00:04:43,627
Let it go.

75
00:04:44,754 --> 00:04:47,464
Okay. I'll let it go.

76
00:04:50,093 --> 00:04:51,927
I mean,
if it was up to you,

77
00:04:52,012 --> 00:04:54,013
our kids wouldn't even write
thank-you notes.

78
00:04:54,097 --> 00:04:56,056
You know, they'd just
send out good vibes.

79
00:04:56,141 --> 00:04:57,600
That's not nice.

80
00:05:02,731 --> 00:05:04,148
Do you believe
our baby's 18?

81
00:05:04,232 --> 00:05:05,608
No, I can't.

82
00:05:05,692 --> 00:05:06,734
You big girl.

83
00:05:06,818 --> 00:05:07,902
Such a big girl.

84
00:05:07,986 --> 00:05:10,529
Big girl. Big girl.

85
00:05:10,614 --> 00:05:11,780
Mom.
What?

86
00:05:13,658 --> 00:05:15,034
Oh. Thank you.

87
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:20,664
Hey.
Hey.

88
00:05:21,917 --> 00:05:23,667
What are you doing?

89
00:05:23,752 --> 00:05:24,919
Writing my thank-you notes.

90
00:05:25,003 --> 00:05:26,045
That's good.

91
00:05:26,129 --> 00:05:27,880
You know, you don't have to start
with an apology.

92
00:05:27,964 --> 00:05:28,923
Yeah, that'd
be embarrassing.

93
00:05:29,007 --> 00:05:30,090
That's terrible.

94
00:05:31,843 --> 00:05:37,389
Hey, have you thought any more about
making that call?

95
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:40,225
Yeah, I don't want to.

96
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:42,311
How can you not even
be curious about it?

97
00:05:42,395 --> 00:05:46,941
Look, I'm leaving soon, and I don't
want to have to deal with that right now.

98
00:05:47,025 --> 00:05:49,318
Also, that could really
hurt Moms' feelings.

99
00:05:49,402 --> 00:05:51,612
God, why do you have to worry about
them so much?

100
00:05:51,696 --> 00:05:53,739
They don't even
have to know about it.

101
00:05:53,823 --> 00:05:56,742
Look, you can do it
when you turn 18, okay?

102
00:05:57,702 --> 00:05:59,703
I never ask you
for anything.

103
00:06:07,545 --> 00:06:10,756
I just don't understand
why you bought the truck now.

104
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,633
Because if I'm gonna
start this business,

105
00:06:12,717 --> 00:06:15,135
I need something
to haul my equipment in.

106
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:18,555
Okay. It just seems a little
cart before the horse.

107
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,349
What does that mean?

108
00:06:20,433 --> 00:06:23,978
Well, sweetie, you don't have
any clients yet.

109
00:06:24,062 --> 00:06:25,062
You know,

110
00:06:26,272 --> 00:06:29,566
you're the one who's always telling me
to act "as if."

111
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:34,071
That's true. I do.
You're right.

112
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:40,369
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
It's good you bought the truck.

113
00:06:41,454 --> 00:06:43,622
It's proactive.
Yeah.

114
00:06:47,002 --> 00:06:50,295
Hey, you wanna
watch a movie?

115
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:52,756
A movie-movie?

116
00:06:52,841 --> 00:06:55,509
Yeah. We haven't
done that in a while.

117
00:06:58,221 --> 00:06:59,555
All right.

118
00:07:41,306 --> 00:07:43,640
You know, I don't
like the guys in this one.

119
00:07:43,725 --> 00:07:45,142
They're too shaved.

120
00:07:45,226 --> 00:07:47,019
Don't focus on it.

121
00:07:47,103 --> 00:07:48,312
Okay.

122
00:08:04,454 --> 00:08:06,580
Fuck. Oh, my God.

123
00:08:06,664 --> 00:08:08,207
Hey, hey, I'm cold.

124
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:09,583
I can't
breathe, honey.

125
00:08:09,667 --> 00:08:10,709
Well...

126
00:08:10,794 --> 00:08:11,835
Shit!

127
00:08:12,504 --> 00:08:13,587
Shit!

128
00:08:15,965 --> 00:08:18,884
Where's the remote?
Where's the remote?

129
00:08:21,387 --> 00:08:22,763
Oh, my God.

130
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:25,224
The whole neighborhood
heard that.

131
00:08:25,308 --> 00:08:26,934
No, they didn't.

132
00:08:27,018 --> 00:08:28,977
Shit.

133
00:08:29,062 --> 00:08:30,896
That was a vibe kill.

134
00:08:42,534 --> 00:08:44,868
Hey, hey, Brooke,
can you do me a favor?

135
00:08:44,953 --> 00:08:46,703
Can you get that
Swiss chard for me?

136
00:08:46,788 --> 00:08:48,080
Sure, no problem.

137
00:08:48,164 --> 00:08:49,373
Thanks.

138
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:22,990
How are you?
Hey, Paul.

139
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,453
Hey, foxy.

140
00:09:29,122 --> 00:09:30,330
Hey.

141
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,707
Mmm.

142
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:33,333
Flapjack, you are
smelling ripe.

143
00:09:33,418 --> 00:09:34,459
Oh, sorry.

144
00:09:34,544 --> 00:09:36,253
That's all right.
I kind of like it.

145
00:09:36,337 --> 00:09:38,172
Oh, yeah?
It's earthy.

146
00:09:38,256 --> 00:09:40,007
I've been out
in the garden hoeing.

147
00:09:41,259 --> 00:09:42,926
How are we doing tonight?
It's gonna be tight.

148
00:09:43,011 --> 00:09:44,887
Oh, really?

149
00:09:44,971 --> 00:09:46,388
Go to work.

150
00:09:48,224 --> 00:09:49,349
See you.

151
00:09:50,143 --> 00:09:51,185
Hello?

152
00:09:51,269 --> 00:09:53,020
Hi.
Is this Paul Hatfield?

153
00:09:54,022 --> 00:09:56,064
Yes, it is. Who's this?

154
00:09:56,149 --> 00:10:00,277
My name is Wendy Mitner,
and I'm calling from The Pacific Cryobank.

155
00:10:00,361 --> 00:10:02,404
Okay, Wendy Mitner.
What can I do for you?

156
00:10:02,488 --> 00:10:05,073
I just need to confirm that this is the same
Paul Hatfield

157
00:10:05,158 --> 00:10:08,994
that donated sperm with us
between 1991 and 1993.

158
00:10:10,622 --> 00:10:13,457
Yeah, I did a little bit
of that back then, sure.

159
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:16,627
Well, as you know, the Cryobank has a
confidentiality policy

160
00:10:16,711 --> 00:10:18,921
which prohibits us
from releasing your identity

161
00:10:19,005 --> 00:10:20,839
without your consent.

162
00:10:23,968 --> 00:10:26,178
No... Yeah, yeah,
yeah, I knew that.

163
00:10:26,262 --> 00:10:27,512
Well, we've been contacted

164
00:10:27,597 --> 00:10:29,890
by a young woman
conceived using your donation,

165
00:10:29,974 --> 00:10:33,727
and she's asked if you'd be open to
having contact with her.

166
00:10:36,814 --> 00:10:40,234
Yeah, I'd be conceivably into something
like that. Yeah.

167
00:10:40,318 --> 00:10:44,404
Great, Mr. Hatfield. I'll let her know and
get back in touch soon.

168
00:10:44,489 --> 00:10:45,656
Thanks.

169
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,035
Oh...

170
00:11:01,923 --> 00:11:03,298
I mean,
I was 19 years old.

171
00:11:03,383 --> 00:11:05,801
It was, like, just so long ago.
I totally forgot about it.

172
00:11:05,885 --> 00:11:07,928
I never thought
they'd ever use my stuff.

173
00:11:08,012 --> 00:11:09,054
Why not?

174
00:11:09,138 --> 00:11:10,264
Well, I'd use it.

175
00:11:10,348 --> 00:11:11,556
Oh, baby.

176
00:11:12,892 --> 00:11:13,976
It's weird.

177
00:11:14,602 --> 00:11:19,648
There's a kid out there.
I mean, I'm kind of curious, I think.

178
00:11:19,732 --> 00:11:21,525
Yeah?
Yeah.

179
00:11:21,609 --> 00:11:23,610
So what are you gonna do?

180
00:11:23,695 --> 00:11:24,861
I don't know.
What would you do?

181
00:11:25,488 --> 00:11:26,655
I don't know.

182
00:11:26,739 --> 00:11:27,823
You got to figure it out.

183
00:11:27,907 --> 00:11:29,658
Yeah, no doubt.

184
00:11:31,619 --> 00:11:33,745
All right, I got to go now.
All right.

185
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:36,456
Thanks for coming.
It was really nice.

186
00:11:38,584 --> 00:11:40,419
I'll see you tomorrow.

187
00:11:40,503 --> 00:11:42,045
So, drive safe.

188
00:11:53,057 --> 00:11:55,809
M-E-R. "Zoomer."

189
00:11:55,893 --> 00:11:56,977
No way.

190
00:11:57,061 --> 00:11:58,061
That is so not a word.

191
00:11:58,146 --> 00:11:59,229
No, it totally is.

192
00:11:59,272 --> 00:12:00,731
That's not a word.
If you're gonna zoom somewhere,

193
00:12:00,815 --> 00:12:02,357
then you're a zoomer.
A person who zooms.

194
00:12:03,526 --> 00:12:04,651
So that would be...
Let's see, that's 31...

195
00:12:04,736 --> 00:12:05,819
Hello?

196
00:12:05,903 --> 00:12:07,904
Hi.
I'm looking for Joni Allgood.

197
00:12:07,989 --> 00:12:09,573
Yeah, this is she.

198
00:12:10,908 --> 00:12:12,492
Hey.

199
00:12:12,577 --> 00:12:15,787
This is Paul, your donor.

200
00:12:15,872 --> 00:12:17,164
Eleven points
for Mommy.

201
00:12:17,248 --> 00:12:18,749
Oh! Hi.

202
00:12:19,917 --> 00:12:22,377
Hey. Don't be a zoomer.

203
00:12:22,462 --> 00:12:23,503
Hey.

204
00:12:23,588 --> 00:12:24,629
Come back.

205
00:12:24,714 --> 00:12:26,173
Is this a good time to talk?

206
00:12:26,257 --> 00:12:28,133
Yeah. No,
this is great.

207
00:12:28,217 --> 00:12:32,471
So, how are you?
How are you?

208
00:12:32,555 --> 00:12:34,097
I'm good.
How are you?

209
00:12:34,182 --> 00:12:35,474
I'm well, thanks.

210
00:12:36,768 --> 00:12:39,394
Wendy at the Cryobank

211
00:12:40,396 --> 00:12:42,856
was talking about maybe...

212
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:44,149
Oh, yeah. Well.

213
00:12:44,233 --> 00:12:46,568
Actually, my brother
asked if I'd call you,

214
00:12:46,652 --> 00:12:49,279
because I'm 18,
and he's only 15, which is,

215
00:12:49,364 --> 00:12:51,323
you know, which is
too young to call.

216
00:12:51,407 --> 00:12:53,825
Anyway, he'd like
to meet you.

217
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:55,118
You know,
if you want to.

218
00:12:55,203 --> 00:12:57,329
Your brother?

219
00:12:57,413 --> 00:13:00,499
Yeah. Well, technically
he's my half-brother.

220
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:03,877
Each of my moms had a kid,
you know, with...

221
00:13:03,961 --> 00:13:05,504
With your...
With your sperm.

222
00:13:06,172 --> 00:13:07,547
Like in both of them?

223
00:13:07,632 --> 00:13:08,799
Yeah.

224
00:13:08,883 --> 00:13:10,217
Like in two?

225
00:13:10,301 --> 00:13:11,802
Uh-huh. Like in gay.

226
00:13:13,012 --> 00:13:15,347
Oh! Right. Right.
Right on.

227
00:13:15,431 --> 00:13:18,058
Right on.
Yeah, cool. I...

228
00:13:18,142 --> 00:13:19,726
I love lesbians.

229
00:13:22,897 --> 00:13:24,398
Great.
So you wanna,

230
00:13:24,482 --> 00:13:28,527
I don't know, get a bite to eat or
something? You and your brother?

231
00:13:36,994 --> 00:13:39,538
I just don't want you
to have big expectations.

232
00:13:39,622 --> 00:13:41,915
Will you quit saying that?
I have no expectations, all right?

233
00:13:41,999 --> 00:13:45,544
Okay. I'm just saying.
He might be weird.

234
00:13:45,628 --> 00:13:49,423
I mean, he donated sperm.
That's weird.

235
00:13:49,507 --> 00:13:53,343
Well, you know, if he hadn't, we wouldn't
be here, so respect.

236
00:14:07,191 --> 00:14:08,525
Hello?

237
00:14:10,111 --> 00:14:11,361
Hey. Hey.

238
00:14:12,405 --> 00:14:14,114
You're Joni, right?
Hi, I'm Joni.

239
00:14:14,198 --> 00:14:15,866
I'm Paul. Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

240
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:17,617
You must be Laser?
Laser, yeah.

241
00:14:17,702 --> 00:14:19,369
Right on.
That's a very cool name.

242
00:14:19,454 --> 00:14:20,620
Thanks.

243
00:14:20,705 --> 00:14:21,955
Well...

244
00:14:22,665 --> 00:14:23,790
Cool.

245
00:14:24,834 --> 00:14:26,793
Yeah. Yeah.

246
00:14:26,878 --> 00:14:30,881
Listen, you know, feel free
to ask me anything, anything you want.

247
00:14:32,008 --> 00:14:34,050
Cool, thanks. Yeah.
Cool.

248
00:14:37,513 --> 00:14:42,434
Laser, do you have
any questions that you wanna ask?

249
00:14:42,518 --> 00:14:43,602
Go ahead, shoot.
Anything.

250
00:14:43,686 --> 00:14:48,190
I didn't really have any, you know,
specific questions or anything, so...

251
00:14:48,274 --> 00:14:49,316
Nothing?

252
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,485
Not really.

253
00:14:51,569 --> 00:14:53,945
Well, I mean, I'd love to know more
about you guys.

254
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:55,822
Everything. I mean...

255
00:14:55,907 --> 00:14:58,742
So what do you do, Joni?
What are you into?

256
00:15:00,495 --> 00:15:04,289
I just graduated high school, and I'm
starting college in the fall, so...

257
00:15:04,373 --> 00:15:05,832
Hey, that's great.
Congratulations.

258
00:15:05,917 --> 00:15:07,000
Thanks.

259
00:15:07,084 --> 00:15:09,002
Yeah,
Joni's the brains in the family.

260
00:15:09,086 --> 00:15:11,880
She's got the National
Merit Scholarship for science.

261
00:15:11,964 --> 00:15:13,298
Shut the front door.

262
00:15:13,382 --> 00:15:14,674
Okay, Laser, thanks.

263
00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:16,426
Wow.
I'm just telling him you're smart.

264
00:15:16,511 --> 00:15:18,845
No, I just work
harder than you.

265
00:15:20,014 --> 00:15:22,933
Hey, Laze, seriously,
don't sweat school, man.

266
00:15:23,017 --> 00:15:28,313
I mean, I didn't do well in school either,
and I'm not doing so badly now, right?

267
00:15:29,565 --> 00:15:31,775
It's Laser. Yeah.

268
00:15:32,985 --> 00:15:35,987
Sorry. Laser. Right.

269
00:15:36,072 --> 00:15:37,364
It's cool.

270
00:15:37,448 --> 00:15:39,950
So, what are you
into, Laser?

271
00:15:41,118 --> 00:15:42,661
Laser's an amazing athlete.

272
00:15:42,745 --> 00:15:44,454
Really? Yeah?

273
00:15:45,081 --> 00:15:46,998
Did you ever play
any sports in school or...

274
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:49,709
I did a little
B- ball in junior high.

275
00:15:49,794 --> 00:15:52,170
That's cool.
Was that it or...

276
00:15:52,255 --> 00:15:55,215
Well, the whole "team" thing just got
on my nerves after a while, you know?

277
00:15:55,299 --> 00:15:58,760
It was like, "Hey, let's go kick some
ass, man! " And...

278
00:15:59,971 --> 00:16:01,137
What about you?

279
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:06,685
I play soccer,
basketball, baseball.

280
00:16:06,769 --> 00:16:09,396
You know,
all the team sort of sports.

281
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,522
Hey, man,

282
00:16:10,606 --> 00:16:13,316
I wasn't generally
bagging on teams.

283
00:16:13,401 --> 00:16:16,570
I mean, teams are great.
I'm just weird that way.

284
00:16:16,654 --> 00:16:18,989
I like teams.
They're cool.

285
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:21,032
Cool.

286
00:16:22,493 --> 00:16:24,160
So this is your
place, right?

287
00:16:24,245 --> 00:16:25,954
Yeah, yeah, this is mine.
It's cool.

288
00:16:26,038 --> 00:16:27,497
You know,
I've been working on it for a while.

289
00:16:27,582 --> 00:16:32,335
I also have a little organic co-op farm just
up the street here.

290
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:35,755
Just keeping it kind
of local and organic

291
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,215
and simple,
American food.

292
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,342
That's so cool.
I'm totally into local.

293
00:16:40,553 --> 00:16:42,012
Yeah?
You are?

294
00:16:43,806 --> 00:16:44,973
Yeah, Laser.

295
00:16:45,057 --> 00:16:49,352
I've been trying to get
Moms, you know, to buy local for ages.

296
00:16:53,232 --> 00:16:54,566
All right.

297
00:16:56,527 --> 00:16:58,570
We're just over here. There.
Right. Yeah.

298
00:16:58,654 --> 00:17:00,280
Okay.

299
00:17:00,364 --> 00:17:01,698
Is that your bike?

300
00:17:01,782 --> 00:17:03,617
Yeah, yeah.
You like motorcycles?

301
00:17:03,701 --> 00:17:06,620
Yeah, I love them,

302
00:17:06,704 --> 00:17:10,040
but, you know, our moms are kind
of anti-motorcycle.

303
00:17:10,124 --> 00:17:12,876
By "kind of" he means that they'd
kill us if we ever rode one, so...

304
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,669
Oh, that's too bad.
They're a lot of fun.

305
00:17:14,754 --> 00:17:16,212
Yeah, I'm sure.

306
00:17:18,841 --> 00:17:19,883
Cool.

307
00:17:19,967 --> 00:17:21,092
Cool.
Yeah.

308
00:17:22,053 --> 00:17:24,220
It was great...
Great meeting you, yeah.

309
00:17:24,305 --> 00:17:25,513
Nice to meet you, too.

310
00:17:25,598 --> 00:17:27,057
Yeah. It's okay,
right? Good?

311
00:17:27,141 --> 00:17:28,224
Yeah, for sure.

312
00:17:28,309 --> 00:17:29,476
Hey, Laser,
really nice to meet you.

313
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,645
Yeah, you too.

314
00:17:32,563 --> 00:17:33,647
All right.
All right.

315
00:17:33,731 --> 00:17:34,731
So long.

316
00:17:34,815 --> 00:17:35,982
Bye.

317
00:17:36,067 --> 00:17:37,192
Keep in touch.
Yeah.

318
00:17:37,276 --> 00:17:38,693
Okay?
Yeah.

319
00:17:47,912 --> 00:17:52,165
Wow. I just never pictured him
that way, you know?

320
00:17:52,249 --> 00:17:54,626
He was so cool
and interesting.

321
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:56,252
Yeah, he's all right.

322
00:17:57,797 --> 00:17:58,963
What do you mean
"all right"?

323
00:18:00,758 --> 00:18:03,593
Laser, you're the one
who wanted to meet him so bad.

324
00:18:03,678 --> 00:18:05,178
I know.

325
00:18:05,262 --> 00:18:07,597
Yeah, so what did
you think of him?

326
00:18:07,682 --> 00:18:09,015
I think he's all right.

327
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:11,810
I mean, I think he's
a little into himself.

328
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,646
God.
What?

329
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:16,398
You're asking my opinion.
Whatever.

330
00:18:16,482 --> 00:18:18,483
We are so not telling Moms.

331
00:18:18,567 --> 00:18:19,776
Why not?

332
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,069
Ha, ha. Very funny.

333
00:18:23,239 --> 00:18:24,739
He wants to die!

334
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:27,117
He wants to die.

335
00:18:27,576 --> 00:18:29,828
Remind me not to take
heroin in Morocco. Or Uganda.

336
00:18:29,912 --> 00:18:33,206
Yeah. I hate it
when that happens.

337
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:36,626
... it is now time to call it.

338
00:18:36,711 --> 00:18:40,380
Someone took my knife.
I want my knife back!

339
00:18:41,966 --> 00:18:43,883
Hey, bug, come here.

340
00:18:43,968 --> 00:18:45,051
We're watching
Locked Up Abroad.

341
00:18:45,136 --> 00:18:46,219
I want my knife back!

342
00:18:46,303 --> 00:18:47,387
Yeah, I've seen
that one. It's good.

343
00:18:47,471 --> 00:18:48,722
Where you going?

344
00:18:48,806 --> 00:18:50,306
Clay's.

345
00:18:50,391 --> 00:18:51,391
Don't be back late.

346
00:18:51,475 --> 00:18:52,517
I know, I know, I know.

347
00:18:52,601 --> 00:18:54,394
Hey, hey. Come give us
a hug before you go.

348
00:18:54,478 --> 00:18:55,437
Hugs.
Come on.

349
00:18:55,521 --> 00:18:56,521
No, Mom.

350
00:18:56,605 --> 00:18:58,523
Hug her. That's what
she's there for.

351
00:19:05,072 --> 00:19:08,908
Maybe we should
just sit him down and ask him already.

352
00:19:08,993 --> 00:19:11,911
What? "Are you
and Clay fucking?"

353
00:19:11,996 --> 00:19:14,330
"Exploring" is
a better word.

354
00:19:14,415 --> 00:19:16,249
Yeah, well, so, you know,
what if they are "exploring"?

355
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:18,752
This is the age for that.

356
00:19:18,836 --> 00:19:20,044
We should be
good with that.

357
00:19:20,129 --> 00:19:21,254
We should. We should.

358
00:19:21,338 --> 00:19:23,923
I just don't understand
why he's exploring with that loser.

359
00:19:24,008 --> 00:19:27,343
We don't really know what's going on.
We shouldn't jump to conclusions.

360
00:19:27,428 --> 00:19:30,764
I feel like he has so much potential.
He's just wasting it.

361
00:19:33,934 --> 00:19:35,894
What are you
trying to say?

362
00:19:37,062 --> 00:19:38,354
What do you mean,
what am I trying to say?

363
00:19:38,439 --> 00:19:41,107
I just, you know,
I feel like there's some subtext here.

364
00:19:41,192 --> 00:19:42,233
What are you
talking about?

365
00:19:42,318 --> 00:19:44,444
You know,
"like mother, like son"?

366
00:19:44,528 --> 00:19:50,033
Both of us wandering in the dark,
aimless, "wasting our potential."

367
00:19:50,117 --> 00:19:53,328
Honey, you're on
a whole other tangent.

368
00:19:53,412 --> 00:19:55,455
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

369
00:19:55,539 --> 00:20:00,210
Well, you know, maybe it hasn't risen to
the plane of consciousness for you yet.

370
00:20:03,631 --> 00:20:05,048
Yeah. Maybe.

371
00:20:11,347 --> 00:20:13,264
Someone took my knife.

372
00:20:13,349 --> 00:20:15,183
So what were they like?

373
00:20:15,267 --> 00:20:17,268
They were
really sweet kids.

374
00:20:17,353 --> 00:20:23,191
The boy was this little, you know,
kind of sensitive jock-type kid,

375
00:20:23,275 --> 00:20:25,985
and the girl was
really innocent

376
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:30,657
but just whip-smart
and super, super cute.

377
00:20:30,741 --> 00:20:33,743
Sounds like you really liked them,
like you guys connected.

378
00:20:35,704 --> 00:20:39,040
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, I kind of did.

379
00:20:40,543 --> 00:20:42,418
Wow.
So how'd you leave it?

380
00:20:42,503 --> 00:20:43,878
I mean, are you
gonna see them again?

381
00:20:43,963 --> 00:20:45,171
I... Hey, Brooke.

382
00:20:45,256 --> 00:20:46,631
Hey, Paul.
Check these out.

383
00:20:46,715 --> 00:20:48,007
How you doing?
Good.

384
00:20:48,092 --> 00:20:49,968
Wow, look at those
strawberries, man.

385
00:20:50,052 --> 00:20:51,010
They're just...

386
00:20:51,095 --> 00:20:52,178
Aren't they beautiful?

387
00:20:52,263 --> 00:20:53,930
I thought you should
have the first taste.

388
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:55,598
Thank you.

389
00:20:59,937 --> 00:21:03,314
"I thought you should
have the first taste" of my pussy.

390
00:21:04,608 --> 00:21:05,942
I'm sorry.

391
00:21:09,363 --> 00:21:10,864
Dude, I don't even
think they smoke pot.

392
00:21:10,948 --> 00:21:12,949
Dude, hold up.

393
00:21:19,123 --> 00:21:21,291
Come on, let's go.
Seriously.

394
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:24,544
Oh! Dude!

395
00:21:24,628 --> 00:21:26,004
God, disgusting!
Come on, let's go.

396
00:21:26,088 --> 00:21:27,213
It's alive, dude!

397
00:21:27,298 --> 00:21:28,381
Put it back.

398
00:21:28,465 --> 00:21:29,883
Fine, fine, fine.

399
00:21:31,051 --> 00:21:32,135
Sweet!

400
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:35,263
Dude, we're watching this.

401
00:21:45,566 --> 00:21:48,735
You think the whole
thing's like this?

402
00:21:48,819 --> 00:21:51,237
Maybe...

403
00:21:51,322 --> 00:21:53,573
Maybe we should
fast forward.

404
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:15,178
Laser, you left your bike
in the driveway again.

405
00:22:21,352 --> 00:22:25,313
Laser, your mom and I accept and
love you unconditionally.

406
00:22:25,397 --> 00:22:27,523
You know that, right?

407
00:22:27,608 --> 00:22:28,733
Yeah.

408
00:22:28,817 --> 00:22:33,279
Yeah. And you know that you can be
open with us about anything.

409
00:22:34,531 --> 00:22:36,616
Yeah, I know.
Okay.

410
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:40,662
Laser, do you want to talk to us
about anything?

411
00:22:40,746 --> 00:22:41,829
Like what?

412
00:22:41,914 --> 00:22:42,997
Just anything.

413
00:22:43,082 --> 00:22:45,750
You know, anything
on your mind.

414
00:22:47,044 --> 00:22:52,215
Well, there is something.
But it's more of a question, though.

415
00:22:52,299 --> 00:22:53,466
That's okay.

416
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:55,510
We won't judge you.

417
00:22:57,721 --> 00:23:00,723
Why do you guys
watch gay man porn?

418
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:07,897
Well, first I have to say
that we rarely watch that movie.

419
00:23:07,982 --> 00:23:09,148
Honey.

420
00:23:09,233 --> 00:23:11,484
And, second,
I really don't appreciate

421
00:23:11,568 --> 00:23:13,236
you snooping around
our room, okay?

422
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,196
Was that Clay's idea?
No, Mom.

423
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,657
Wait a minute.
I have to say, again, I don't like him.

424
00:23:17,741 --> 00:23:18,992
I know. I know.

425
00:23:19,076 --> 00:23:20,910
Okay, he seems unstable.

426
00:23:20,995 --> 00:23:22,870
Honey, honey,
that's not what he asked.

427
00:23:22,955 --> 00:23:24,414
Do you want to answer
his question?

428
00:23:24,498 --> 00:23:25,873
Yeah, okay.

429
00:23:27,418 --> 00:23:31,462
Well, sweetie, you know,
human sexuality is complicated.

430
00:23:31,547 --> 00:23:35,842
And sometimes desire can be,
you know, counterintuitive.

431
00:23:35,926 --> 00:23:37,677
You know, for example,

432
00:23:37,761 --> 00:23:41,472
because women's
sexual responsiveness is internalized,

433
00:23:41,557 --> 00:23:45,601
sometimes it's exciting for us to
see responsiveness externalized,

434
00:23:45,686 --> 00:23:48,479
like with a...
Like with a penis.

435
00:23:49,189 --> 00:23:51,441
Wouldn't you guys just rather
watch girls doing it, though?

436
00:23:51,525 --> 00:23:53,026
Well, you would think that.

437
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:57,155
But usually in these movies,
they hire two straight women to pretend,

438
00:23:57,239 --> 00:23:58,614
and the inauthenticity
is just unbearable.

439
00:23:58,699 --> 00:24:00,283
Whoa, that's enough.

440
00:24:04,121 --> 00:24:06,539
Laser, your mom
and I sense

441
00:24:06,623 --> 00:24:08,708
that there's some
other stuff going on in your life.

442
00:24:08,792 --> 00:24:10,835
We just want
to be let in.

443
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:12,378
What do you mean?

444
00:24:12,463 --> 00:24:15,506
Are you having a relationship
with someone?

445
00:24:15,591 --> 00:24:19,510
You can tell us, honey.
We would understand and support you.

446
00:24:20,429 --> 00:24:22,638
Look, I only met him once.

447
00:24:23,599 --> 00:24:24,974
What do you mean once?

448
00:24:25,059 --> 00:24:26,309
Did he find you online?
Wait.

449
00:24:26,435 --> 00:24:27,727
What?
Wait, wait, who did you meet once?

450
00:24:27,811 --> 00:24:28,895
Paul. I met him with Joni.

451
00:24:28,979 --> 00:24:29,979
Paul? Who's Paul?

452
00:24:30,064 --> 00:24:31,939
Why was Joni there?
She set it up.

453
00:24:32,024 --> 00:24:34,317
Wait, forget the set-up.
Who's Paul?

454
00:24:34,401 --> 00:24:35,860
Our sperm donor.

455
00:24:42,743 --> 00:24:44,660
Did you guys think
I was gay?

456
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:47,413
No.

457
00:24:47,498 --> 00:24:48,664
No way.

458
00:24:48,749 --> 00:24:50,416
Of course not.

459
00:24:50,501 --> 00:24:52,752
Yeah, I mean, we understand
that you'd be curious

460
00:24:52,836 --> 00:24:54,420
about your biological father.

461
00:24:54,505 --> 00:24:56,756
I mean,
it's completely natural.

462
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,716
But why didn't you tell us?

463
00:24:58,801 --> 00:25:00,009
Because we knew
you'd be upset.

464
00:25:00,094 --> 00:25:01,886
We're not upset!
No, no, no.

465
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:05,098
We're not. We wish that
you'd included us in the conversation.

466
00:25:05,307 --> 00:25:06,307
That's all.

467
00:25:06,433 --> 00:25:10,228
You know? But...
But you met him, and that's cool.

468
00:25:10,312 --> 00:25:12,355
And now,
we can move on.

469
00:25:14,817 --> 00:25:16,275
Actually,
I want to see him again.

470
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,778
You do?

471
00:25:18,862 --> 00:25:20,238
Yeah, I was
gonna tell you.

472
00:25:20,322 --> 00:25:23,157
Well, no. Okay?
No way.

473
00:25:23,242 --> 00:25:26,035
No one's seeing anyone
until we meet him.

474
00:25:30,207 --> 00:25:34,752
I get it, okay? He's their biological
father and all that crap.

475
00:25:34,837 --> 00:25:38,297
But it still feels
really shitty.

476
00:25:38,382 --> 00:25:41,300
Like we're not enough
or something, you know?

477
00:25:41,385 --> 00:25:43,928
Of course I know.
You know, I don't...

478
00:25:44,012 --> 00:25:47,181
I don't want to time-share
our kids with anybody.

479
00:25:47,266 --> 00:25:51,310
Especially when it's Joni's last summer
at home.

480
00:25:51,395 --> 00:25:52,603
No way.

481
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:59,068
Jesus, Jules!

482
00:25:59,153 --> 00:26:02,822
The plumber was just here.
God, it's gross.

483
00:26:03,699 --> 00:26:07,493
Look, we have to be
smart about this.

484
00:26:07,578 --> 00:26:12,039
You know, if we act like grubby bitches,
we're just gonna make it worse.

485
00:26:12,124 --> 00:26:13,833
I know.

486
00:26:13,917 --> 00:26:17,837
Let's just kill him
with kindness and put it to bed.

487
00:26:17,921 --> 00:26:19,672
I'm with you, honey.

488
00:26:20,966 --> 00:26:23,467
We're gonna get
through this, okay?

489
00:26:25,179 --> 00:26:26,929
I love you, chicken.

490
00:26:27,014 --> 00:26:28,848
I love you, too, pony.

491
00:27:06,595 --> 00:27:09,388
Paul. It's so great
to meet you. Hi. Yeah.

492
00:27:09,473 --> 00:27:11,891
Great to meet you, too.

493
00:27:11,975 --> 00:27:13,142
Hey. Jules.
Hello, Jules.

494
00:27:13,227 --> 00:27:14,894
I'm Nic.
Hi, Nic.

495
00:27:14,978 --> 00:27:15,978
Hi.

496
00:27:16,063 --> 00:27:17,730
I hope the traffic
wasn't too bad.

497
00:27:17,814 --> 00:27:20,399
No, I took my motorcycle,
so I pretty much just weave through it.

498
00:27:20,484 --> 00:27:21,734
Oh, great.

499
00:27:21,818 --> 00:27:23,819
I brought you this.

500
00:27:23,904 --> 00:27:25,238
I don't know if
you folks drink wine.

501
00:27:25,322 --> 00:27:27,073
Oh, no, are you kidding?
We love it.

502
00:27:27,157 --> 00:27:29,909
Wow, a Petite Sirah.
What a treat!

503
00:27:29,993 --> 00:27:31,285
'86.

504
00:27:31,411 --> 00:27:33,454
Yeah. I'll get some glasses.
All right.

505
00:27:39,086 --> 00:27:41,545
Yeah. Wow.

506
00:27:41,672 --> 00:27:43,422
Beautiful house.
Yeah, thanks. Thanks.

507
00:27:43,507 --> 00:27:44,548
You guys been here
a long time?

508
00:27:44,633 --> 00:27:47,343
Yeah. You know,
about 10 years.

509
00:27:47,427 --> 00:27:49,428
God, has it been
that long? I mean...

510
00:27:50,681 --> 00:27:53,849
That's... Yeah.
You know them, yeah.

511
00:27:54,851 --> 00:27:56,394
Hey, Joni.
How you doing?

512
00:27:56,478 --> 00:27:58,229
Good, how are you?
Good.

513
00:27:58,313 --> 00:28:00,106
Hey, man.
Hey.

514
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:01,565
What's up, man?

515
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:03,109
You okay?

516
00:28:03,193 --> 00:28:05,861
Yeah. Yeah, great.

517
00:28:05,946 --> 00:28:08,406
Go easy on the wine, hon.
It's daytime.

518
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:11,492
Okay. Same goes for the micromanaging.
Okay?

519
00:28:16,373 --> 00:28:19,959
So, Paul, did you
always know that...

520
00:28:20,043 --> 00:28:21,043
Yes.

521
00:28:21,128 --> 00:28:24,422
...that you wanted to be
in the food services industry?

522
00:28:25,299 --> 00:28:27,550
I always liked food.

523
00:28:27,634 --> 00:28:28,968
Oh, yeah.

524
00:28:29,052 --> 00:28:32,263
No, I was asking because I remember
when I was reading your file,

525
00:28:32,347 --> 00:28:34,890
back when we were
looking for,

526
00:28:34,975 --> 00:28:37,351
you know, sperm...

527
00:28:37,477 --> 00:28:38,894
Can I have the potato
salad, babe? Sure.

528
00:28:38,979 --> 00:28:42,773
Anyway, you said that you were studying
international relations.

529
00:28:42,858 --> 00:28:47,069
Oh, yeah. Wow, that was a...
That was a long time ago.

530
00:28:48,822 --> 00:28:52,450
Yeah, I was considering it,
but then I dropped out of school.

531
00:28:55,871 --> 00:28:57,830
You dropped
out of college?

532
00:28:57,914 --> 00:28:59,623
Yeah, it just
wasn't my thing.

533
00:28:59,708 --> 00:29:01,542
No? Why's that?
I don't know.

534
00:29:01,626 --> 00:29:05,046
It just seemed like a massive waste
of money after a while, you know?

535
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:07,923
I was just sitting
on my ass listening to people spout ideas.

536
00:29:08,008 --> 00:29:10,509
I could just as easily
have learned in a book.

537
00:29:12,804 --> 00:29:13,971
Oh.

538
00:29:14,931 --> 00:29:16,015
Okay.

539
00:29:16,099 --> 00:29:18,225
I'm not saying that,
you know,

540
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:21,062
I think that higher learning
uniformly blows.

541
00:29:21,146 --> 00:29:23,522
You know, I think
college is great for some people.

542
00:29:23,607 --> 00:29:25,191
Joni, I'm sure
you're gonna love it.

543
00:29:25,275 --> 00:29:28,194
But just... I'm a doer.
That's how I learn.

544
00:29:28,278 --> 00:29:32,156
It's just me.
I'm weird that way, I guess. Thank you.

545
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,950
Which is probably why
I'm in the food services industry.

546
00:29:36,119 --> 00:29:37,203
Right.

547
00:29:37,287 --> 00:29:39,372
Hey, Mom,
you see what he did there, right?

548
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:40,414
You said "food
services industry,"

549
00:29:40,499 --> 00:29:42,750
so then he said
"food services industry."

550
00:29:42,834 --> 00:29:44,627
Yeah. I got that,
Laser. Thanks.

551
00:29:46,046 --> 00:29:49,548
So, Paul,
what about your...

552
00:29:49,633 --> 00:29:52,093
What about
your social life?

553
00:29:52,177 --> 00:29:54,095
My social life?

554
00:29:54,179 --> 00:29:56,722
Yeah, you know,
are you married, divorced, seeing anyone?

555
00:29:56,807 --> 00:29:58,224
Mom.
What?

556
00:29:58,308 --> 00:30:00,476
We're getting
to know Paul. It's okay.

557
00:30:00,977 --> 00:30:06,315
No, no, it's okay. I...
No, I've never been married nor divorced.

558
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,441
I date sometimes,

559
00:30:07,526 --> 00:30:11,529
but I'm really just
kind of focused on my restaurant right now.

560
00:30:15,158 --> 00:30:18,577
Well, that's...
Yeah. Makes sense.

561
00:30:18,662 --> 00:30:20,079
So, cheers.

562
00:30:20,163 --> 00:30:21,622
Yeah. Cheers.

563
00:30:21,706 --> 00:30:23,040
Excellent wine,
by the way.

564
00:30:23,125 --> 00:30:24,166
Thank you.

565
00:30:26,169 --> 00:30:27,670
How old are you again?

566
00:30:27,754 --> 00:30:30,756
You must be the
griller of the family.

567
00:30:30,841 --> 00:30:32,174
Yeah.

568
00:30:37,431 --> 00:30:38,431
No, that's okay.

569
00:30:38,515 --> 00:30:39,557
I like
to be positive.

570
00:30:39,641 --> 00:30:40,683
Yeah.

571
00:30:40,767 --> 00:30:41,892
So how'd you two meet?

572
00:30:43,145 --> 00:30:44,353
We met at UCLA.

573
00:30:44,438 --> 00:30:46,105
I was a resident,

574
00:30:48,191 --> 00:30:50,151
and Jules had
an emergency.

575
00:30:50,235 --> 00:30:51,235
My tongue was numb.

576
00:30:52,404 --> 00:30:54,780
Really? Your tongue?
Laser.

577
00:30:54,865 --> 00:30:56,240
Oh, my God.

578
00:30:56,324 --> 00:30:57,783
It's not nice.

579
00:30:57,868 --> 00:31:01,078
No, that's not nice. I mean, we've heard
that story 100, 000 times.

580
00:31:01,163 --> 00:31:02,788
What happened to your tongue?
I don't know.

581
00:31:02,873 --> 00:31:07,126
I mean, I lost all the feeling in my face
and my tongue.

582
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:10,796
And then, you know, I got really nervous
'cause I thought that I was gonna gag

583
00:31:10,881 --> 00:31:12,465
and, you know,
maybe like...

584
00:31:12,549 --> 00:31:13,966
Choke? Die?

585
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:15,301
Yeah, exactly.

586
00:31:15,385 --> 00:31:16,385
What'd you do to help her?

587
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:17,511
I gave her a Valium,

588
00:31:17,596 --> 00:31:20,890
and I told her to relax
and tried to get her to talk,

589
00:31:21,016 --> 00:31:23,058
you know, move her tongue around.
Yeah.

590
00:31:23,143 --> 00:31:25,311
Actually, she started teasing me,
and that really helped.

591
00:31:25,395 --> 00:31:26,937
I was trying
to distract you.

592
00:31:27,022 --> 00:31:30,232
I know. It worked.
You were really funny.

593
00:31:30,317 --> 00:31:32,485
You were really pretty.

594
00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:35,821
And then, you know,
my tongue started working again.

595
00:31:37,157 --> 00:31:39,325
Sure.
God, Mom, please.

596
00:31:43,663 --> 00:31:45,331
Yeah.

597
00:31:45,415 --> 00:31:46,832
Wow, we've been glued
at the hip ever since.

598
00:31:46,917 --> 00:31:48,417
Yeah.
No doubt.

599
00:31:49,419 --> 00:31:51,504
Yeah. Great. Great story.

600
00:31:51,588 --> 00:31:53,464
Yeah, we like it.

601
00:31:54,508 --> 00:31:57,051
So, Nic, you, you're a doctor,
I know that.

602
00:31:57,135 --> 00:31:58,594
But what are
you into, Jules?

603
00:31:58,678 --> 00:31:59,970
What do you do?

604
00:32:01,139 --> 00:32:05,351
Well, you know, I mean, I studied
architecture in college.

605
00:32:05,435 --> 00:32:06,435
Right.

606
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:07,978
But I'm not
really an architect.

607
00:32:08,063 --> 00:32:09,688
I mean, I was on my way
to becoming one,

608
00:32:09,773 --> 00:32:12,191
but I quit before
the kids were born.

609
00:32:12,275 --> 00:32:13,400
That happens.

610
00:32:13,485 --> 00:32:14,777
And then when they got
a little bit older,

611
00:32:14,861 --> 00:32:17,363
I started a Balinese furniture
import business.

612
00:32:17,447 --> 00:32:18,864
Right on.

613
00:32:18,949 --> 00:32:21,200
But that didn't
really work out.

614
00:32:21,284 --> 00:32:22,284
Yeah,
businesses aren't easy.

615
00:32:22,369 --> 00:32:23,410
Yeah.

616
00:32:23,495 --> 00:32:26,539
But I'm in the process
of starting a new business.

617
00:32:26,623 --> 00:32:28,207
Great, good for you.
What's that?

618
00:32:28,291 --> 00:32:30,543
Landscape design.
I mean, you know, not gardening.

619
00:32:30,627 --> 00:32:32,795
I mean, you know,
there's a gardening component,

620
00:32:32,879 --> 00:32:38,551
but, really, the real work
is in creating unique,

621
00:32:38,635 --> 00:32:41,387
eco-friendly spaces
that, you know, the surrounding,

622
00:32:41,471 --> 00:32:44,848
that blend, you know,
with the surrounding environment.

623
00:32:44,933 --> 00:32:46,016
You know what I mean?

624
00:32:46,101 --> 00:32:48,519
Definitely.

625
00:32:48,603 --> 00:32:50,563
Most definitely.
Yeah.

626
00:32:53,650 --> 00:32:56,402
Hey, Joni, did you
tell Paul about your graduation speech?

627
00:32:56,486 --> 00:32:57,903
No, she didn't tell me.

628
00:32:57,988 --> 00:33:00,364
It was so full of
wisdom and hope.

629
00:33:00,448 --> 00:33:01,574
Yeah.

630
00:33:01,658 --> 00:33:03,784
Hey, go get it.

631
00:33:05,036 --> 00:33:07,079
You know, I bet Paul
would like to hear it.

632
00:33:07,163 --> 00:33:08,581
No, Mom,
I'm sure he wouldn't.

633
00:33:08,665 --> 00:33:10,040
No, no, no,
sure he would.

634
00:33:10,125 --> 00:33:11,292
Go on, go get it.

635
00:33:11,376 --> 00:33:12,960
No, I don't want to.

636
00:33:13,044 --> 00:33:14,920
Sweetie,
don't be embarrassed.

637
00:33:15,005 --> 00:33:20,259
Mom, I'm not embarrassed.
Jesus, give it a rest. Just let it go.

638
00:33:22,554 --> 00:33:23,721
I'm gonna get
some ice cream.

639
00:33:23,805 --> 00:33:25,055
I'll help.
Okay.

640
00:33:28,893 --> 00:33:30,769
Honey, it's your
fourth glass.

641
00:33:30,854 --> 00:33:35,024
Actually, it's my third.
But, you know, thanks for counting.

642
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:38,444
Hey, I was...
You know, I was thinking.

643
00:33:38,528 --> 00:33:41,071
I just bought this place
last year, and it's...

644
00:33:41,906 --> 00:33:43,198
I mean,
the backyard's a wreck.

645
00:33:43,283 --> 00:33:47,328
Would you be interested in maybe
coming and doing some work for me?

646
00:33:47,412 --> 00:33:48,662
That's okay.

647
00:33:48,747 --> 00:33:50,205
No, seriously.
I can't...

648
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:52,625
I don't have time
to do it myself and...

649
00:33:52,709 --> 00:33:54,418
Well, I mean,
that's really sweet of you,

650
00:33:54,502 --> 00:33:55,794
but you should think
about it, you know.

651
00:33:55,879 --> 00:33:57,630
No, why?
I just did.

652
00:33:57,714 --> 00:34:02,134
I mean, it's all right
if you're not up for it. It's okay.

653
00:34:02,218 --> 00:34:06,388
No, I am.
I'm up for it. Yeah.

654
00:34:07,223 --> 00:34:08,974
Yeah? Yeah?
Hey...

655
00:34:09,059 --> 00:34:10,142
All right.

656
00:34:10,226 --> 00:34:11,644
Okay.

657
00:34:11,728 --> 00:34:13,228
Great.

658
00:34:13,313 --> 00:34:15,189
Excellent.

659
00:34:15,315 --> 00:34:16,899
Right on.
Yeah.

660
00:34:18,735 --> 00:34:23,113
I'm just saying,
the plan was to limit his involvement.

661
00:34:23,198 --> 00:34:25,658
You're unbelievable.
I mean, you're all about me getting clients.

662
00:34:25,742 --> 00:34:27,576
And then I get a client,
and you're like, "Oh, no, not him."

663
00:34:27,661 --> 00:34:29,662
Yeah. But he's not
just a client, Jules.

664
00:34:29,746 --> 00:34:31,121
He's our sperm donor.

665
00:34:31,206 --> 00:34:34,583
I mean, haven't you heard the expression
"don't shit where you eat"?

666
00:34:34,668 --> 00:34:37,336
Yes, and I think
it's disgusting.

667
00:34:40,799 --> 00:34:45,260
Okay, I'm sorry. Look, he just seemed
so self-satisfied to me.

668
00:34:46,221 --> 00:34:48,347
You know?

669
00:34:48,431 --> 00:34:51,350
Yeah, he was working
the "alternative" thing pretty hard.

670
00:34:51,434 --> 00:34:53,686
Oh, my God.
When he said that thing about,

671
00:34:53,770 --> 00:34:58,023
"Oh, I just need to get outside and do
things, not sit on my ass and learn.

672
00:34:58,108 --> 00:35:01,360
"But that's just me, you know.
I'm weird that way."

673
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:17,459
I'd certainly clean up a lot of this grass.
It's pretty... It's wasted.

674
00:35:17,544 --> 00:35:18,711
Sure.

675
00:35:18,795 --> 00:35:21,422
The lavender
is so nice.

676
00:35:21,506 --> 00:35:25,384
And with the sun that
you have, that and, like, that rosemary,

677
00:35:25,468 --> 00:35:27,803
which kind of grow everywhere,
and you wouldn't even have

678
00:35:27,887 --> 00:35:28,887
to think about it.
Yeah.

679
00:35:28,972 --> 00:35:34,601
You could go like a whole,
like, Secret Garden, kind of a trellis-y,

680
00:35:34,686 --> 00:35:37,229
like hidden kind of thing.

681
00:35:37,313 --> 00:35:42,359
Or you could, you know,
you could go like Asian-y.

682
00:35:42,444 --> 00:35:46,280
Minimal. You know, like rocks
and kind of all clean and...

683
00:35:48,575 --> 00:35:49,658
Whatever you think.

684
00:35:49,743 --> 00:35:51,326
Well,
what do you think?

685
00:35:51,411 --> 00:35:55,164
You know what? I'm not...
I'm not feeling minimal.

686
00:35:55,248 --> 00:35:57,875
I really... I'm really
liking more is more.

687
00:35:57,959 --> 00:36:01,086
You know? I mean,
let's not try to tame this space, okay?

688
00:36:01,171 --> 00:36:02,880
Let's just let it be
like lush,

689
00:36:02,964 --> 00:36:06,884
overgrown, fecund.

690
00:36:08,803 --> 00:36:10,137
Fecund.

691
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:14,349
Like fertile, yeah?

692
00:36:14,434 --> 00:36:17,686
No, I love that word. You just, you don't
hear people use it very often.

693
00:36:17,771 --> 00:36:19,438
No, yeah.

694
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:22,941
Yeah, more is more.
Yeah, I like that.

695
00:36:23,026 --> 00:36:25,027
Right on.
Let's do that.

696
00:36:28,656 --> 00:36:30,365
I'm sorry.
What?

697
00:36:32,952 --> 00:36:35,788
I just keep seeing
my kids' expressions in your face.

698
00:36:35,872 --> 00:36:36,914
Really?
Yeah.

699
00:36:36,998 --> 00:36:40,584
Like that. Like, "Really?"
Like, yeah. That's like Laser.

700
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:45,756
Hmm.

701
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,049
Well...

702
00:36:53,890 --> 00:36:56,183
Do you like patios?

703
00:36:56,267 --> 00:36:57,643
Yeah, patios are good. Okay.

704
00:36:57,727 --> 00:36:58,977
Yeah.

705
00:36:59,062 --> 00:37:00,896
We could put a patio up there.
Where?

706
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:02,397
Let's take a look.

707
00:37:03,316 --> 00:37:07,319
Hello. Donor Dad?
Stone cold fox.

708
00:37:07,403 --> 00:37:09,822
Must you take everything beautiful
and make it dirty?

709
00:37:09,906 --> 00:37:11,824
Okay.

710
00:37:11,908 --> 00:37:15,452
I'm just saying.
Spermster's a hottie.

711
00:37:15,537 --> 00:37:17,120
Is he single?

712
00:37:17,205 --> 00:37:20,165
Okay.
First of all, ew,

713
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:22,251
and second,
he's a really good person.

714
00:37:22,335 --> 00:37:26,463
So I'd prefer it if you didn't taint him
with your whore juice.

715
00:37:26,548 --> 00:37:30,300
Fair enough, hairy muff.
I'm out of here.

716
00:37:30,385 --> 00:37:33,345
You lovebirds can
split my letters.

717
00:37:40,228 --> 00:37:41,270
Do you want
to keep playing?

718
00:37:41,354 --> 00:37:42,646
Sure.

719
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:43,981
Okay.

720
00:37:50,446 --> 00:37:53,156
Sometimes I feel sorry
for Sasha, you know?

721
00:37:53,241 --> 00:37:54,449
Yeah.

722
00:37:58,204 --> 00:38:02,749
It's like she has to sexualize
every experience, you know?

723
00:38:02,834 --> 00:38:04,251
It's just sad.

724
00:38:04,335 --> 00:38:06,795
Yeah. Yeah, I know.
That's sad.

725
00:38:15,471 --> 00:38:16,847
Oh, come on.

726
00:38:16,931 --> 00:38:18,849
Hi ya, what's the score?

727
00:38:18,933 --> 00:38:20,225
Pretty close.

728
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:21,894
Yeah?
20 to three. Match point.

729
00:38:22,854 --> 00:38:24,688
So how'd it go today?

730
00:38:24,772 --> 00:38:27,816
It was good.
We settled on a concept.

731
00:38:28,443 --> 00:38:30,152
Ah. What is it?

732
00:38:30,236 --> 00:38:32,112
Well, you know,
it's kind of...

733
00:38:32,196 --> 00:38:34,740
It's kind of hard to explain.

734
00:38:34,824 --> 00:38:37,242
You really have
to see the space.

735
00:38:39,579 --> 00:38:43,206
Okay. Hey, Laser, did you write the
get-well card for Pup-pup?

736
00:38:45,251 --> 00:38:47,002
Laser, come on.

737
00:38:47,086 --> 00:38:50,589
What do I have to do? I bought
you the card. I put it on your desk.

738
00:38:51,507 --> 00:38:52,758
All you have
to do is sign it.

739
00:38:52,842 --> 00:38:54,384
Mom, just settle down,
okay? I'll do it.

740
00:38:54,469 --> 00:38:57,679
Hey. You don't tell me
to settle, mister.

741
00:38:59,849 --> 00:39:01,683
If it's not in the mail
by tomorrow morning,

742
00:39:01,768 --> 00:39:04,061
we're not going to the Dodger game
Saturday, okay?

743
00:39:04,145 --> 00:39:06,647
Whatever. I have
other plans anyways.

744
00:39:06,731 --> 00:39:08,023
What other plans?

745
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,860
I asked you a question.

746
00:39:12,570 --> 00:39:15,697
I said I'd do something
with Paul, okay? God!

747
00:39:20,787 --> 00:39:21,870
Shit!

748
00:39:26,376 --> 00:39:27,793
I believe this might not
be such a good idea.

749
00:39:27,877 --> 00:39:29,002
Are you filming?
Yeah.

750
00:39:29,087 --> 00:39:31,838
He's not gonna make that.
You're not gonna make that, Clay. No way.

751
00:39:31,923 --> 00:39:33,423
Let's do something
different.

752
00:39:33,508 --> 00:39:36,301
Will you quit being
such a choch and run the camera?

753
00:39:36,386 --> 00:39:38,637
I'm only doing this once,
so keep my shit in frame.

754
00:39:42,892 --> 00:39:44,309
All right.

755
00:39:49,107 --> 00:39:50,899
All right, I got it.

756
00:39:56,864 --> 00:39:57,948
Shit! Dude!

757
00:39:59,409 --> 00:40:00,450
Clay, are you all right?
Fuck!

758
00:40:00,535 --> 00:40:02,536
Did you get it, dude?
Clay, you all right, bro?

759
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:04,246
Seriously, are you okay?
I'm fucking fine! Fuck!

760
00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:06,748
Did you fucking
get it? God!

761
00:40:06,833 --> 00:40:09,084
Yeah, I got it.

762
00:40:09,168 --> 00:40:11,420
Fuck, dude.
Clay...

763
00:40:11,504 --> 00:40:13,422
That was fucking crazy.

764
00:40:14,632 --> 00:40:16,299
Where's your place,
Clay, up here?

765
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:19,553
Yeah, right here
on the right.

766
00:40:19,637 --> 00:40:21,471
This is good.
Cool here?

767
00:40:21,556 --> 00:40:23,140
Yeah.

768
00:40:23,224 --> 00:40:25,392
You take care.
Later.

769
00:40:25,476 --> 00:40:26,810
See you.

770
00:40:31,107 --> 00:40:34,026
Let's wait till
he gets to the house.

771
00:40:35,903 --> 00:40:38,947
Maybe we could hang out together just
you and me next time.

772
00:40:39,949 --> 00:40:43,535
Clay's cool. He just...
You know, he gets a little amped sometimes.

773
00:40:43,619 --> 00:40:47,456
That's not amped, man.
That's being a tool.

774
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:49,499
No, he's not a tool, okay?
That's just his way.

775
00:40:49,584 --> 00:40:52,044
Yeah, I don't like the way
he was talking to you at all.

776
00:40:52,128 --> 00:40:53,879
Well, you know what?
You don't know him very well, do you?

777
00:40:53,963 --> 00:40:56,673
I mean, you hung out
with him once.

778
00:40:56,758 --> 00:40:59,051
You're right.
I don't know him.

779
00:41:02,013 --> 00:41:04,431
Can I ask you something?

780
00:41:04,515 --> 00:41:05,766
Sure.

781
00:41:07,602 --> 00:41:09,603
Why'd you donate sperm?

782
00:41:13,816 --> 00:41:17,486
It just seemed like a lot more fun than
donating blood.

783
00:41:21,741 --> 00:41:26,411
No, I loved the idea
of helping people.

784
00:41:26,496 --> 00:41:31,249
People who were in need, you know,
wanted to have kids and couldn't.

785
00:41:31,334 --> 00:41:33,752
So then you did it
to help people?

786
00:41:35,755 --> 00:41:37,672
It was a long time ago.

787
00:41:39,801 --> 00:41:41,468
How much did you
get paid?

788
00:41:41,552 --> 00:41:43,762
Why do you want
to know that?

789
00:41:43,846 --> 00:41:45,472
I'm just curious.

790
00:41:48,184 --> 00:41:51,478
I got paid 60 bucks a pop.

791
00:41:53,022 --> 00:41:54,106
That's it?

792
00:41:54,816 --> 00:41:57,526
Well, it was, like,
a lot of money to me at the time.

793
00:41:57,610 --> 00:42:01,863
And with inflation,
it's like $90 today.

794
00:42:01,948 --> 00:42:03,031
Hey.

795
00:42:04,742 --> 00:42:06,785
I'm glad I did it.

796
00:42:19,173 --> 00:42:20,382
Whoa.

797
00:42:21,259 --> 00:42:22,259
What's this?

798
00:42:22,343 --> 00:42:23,718
Hi. Come here.

799
00:42:25,346 --> 00:42:27,097
Come here. Sit down.

800
00:42:32,228 --> 00:42:37,440
I'm sorry that
I've been so edgy lately, you know.

801
00:42:37,525 --> 00:42:40,026
I know I haven't
been my highest self.

802
00:42:40,111 --> 00:42:41,278
Yeah.

803
00:42:41,362 --> 00:42:45,115
And you've been
really patient with me.

804
00:42:45,199 --> 00:42:49,703
And I just want you to know that that
hasn't gone unrecognized, okay?

805
00:43:02,508 --> 00:43:05,343
How's the water?

806
00:43:05,428 --> 00:43:08,430
It's perfect.
You wanna come in?

807
00:43:09,348 --> 00:43:12,100
In a minute.
You enjoy it first.

808
00:43:17,732 --> 00:43:19,524
I forgot
the lavender bath salts.

809
00:43:19,609 --> 00:43:21,318
Oh, I don't care.
No, no, no.

810
00:43:21,402 --> 00:43:23,236
I wanna get them.
I got them special.

811
00:43:23,321 --> 00:43:25,197
Don't go. Don't.

812
00:43:26,032 --> 00:43:28,325
Don't move.
I'll be right back.

813
00:43:47,470 --> 00:43:49,346
Nic?

814
00:43:52,433 --> 00:43:53,683
Hey, Nic?

815
00:43:55,561 --> 00:43:56,811
Jesus!

816
00:43:59,232 --> 00:44:00,482
Uh-huh.

817
00:44:01,567 --> 00:44:04,277
Right. No,
I understand.

818
00:44:04,362 --> 00:44:09,032
I understand where the pain is, but
it doesn't sound like a contraction.

819
00:44:09,116 --> 00:44:11,701
It sounds more like gas.
I'm sorry.

820
00:44:11,786 --> 00:44:12,994
Fuck!

821
00:44:14,747 --> 00:44:15,914
Right. Okay.

822
00:44:15,998 --> 00:44:19,209
All right, this is our plan.
I don't think you should worry,

823
00:44:19,293 --> 00:44:22,420
and I think you should
just call me back if it continues.

824
00:44:29,929 --> 00:44:31,263
You sure you don't
want any coffee?

825
00:44:31,347 --> 00:44:32,514
No thanks.

826
00:44:32,598 --> 00:44:33,974
It's good.

827
00:44:34,058 --> 00:44:35,267
I'm all right.

828
00:44:35,351 --> 00:44:39,062
But I think I'm gonna go
to the nursery tomorrow,

829
00:44:39,146 --> 00:44:42,190
so I want you to sign off on
this Bougainvillea.

830
00:44:42,275 --> 00:44:43,525
Sure.

831
00:44:44,151 --> 00:44:45,193
What is this?
Did you make it?

832
00:44:45,278 --> 00:44:47,862
Yeah. That's some pie I made.
It's right from my garden.

833
00:44:47,947 --> 00:44:49,739
It's strawberry-rhubarb.

834
00:44:49,824 --> 00:44:51,408
Here. Try.

835
00:44:51,492 --> 00:44:54,119
Yeah, okay.
Twist my arm.

836
00:44:58,708 --> 00:45:00,417
Oh, my God.
It's good, huh?

837
00:45:00,501 --> 00:45:01,626
That's criminal.
Have some more.

838
00:45:01,711 --> 00:45:03,044
No. No, please,
just take it away.

839
00:45:03,129 --> 00:45:04,129
Come on.

840
00:45:04,213 --> 00:45:06,131
You had one bite.
No, if I have one more,

841
00:45:06,215 --> 00:45:09,301
you're gonna have to tape it to my ass
'cause that's where it's gonna end up.

842
00:45:09,385 --> 00:45:12,637
Hey now, don't go negative on your ass.
No reason for that.

843
00:45:18,019 --> 00:45:19,602
You're good with
the plants, then?

844
00:45:28,487 --> 00:45:30,905
'Cause, you know,
I can change it.

845
00:45:30,990 --> 00:45:32,991
If you're not happy with it,
we can do something else.

846
00:45:33,117 --> 00:45:34,993
No. No, no. I'm... We can get whatever
you want, you know?

847
00:45:35,077 --> 00:45:36,745
I'm just thinking.

848
00:45:40,499 --> 00:45:43,668
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I'm good with them.
They're great.

849
00:45:43,753 --> 00:45:44,836
Oh.

850
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:46,421
They're great.

851
00:45:48,883 --> 00:45:52,802
Sorry. Sometimes I mistake
silence for criticism.

852
00:45:53,512 --> 00:45:54,846
I wasn't criticizing you.

853
00:45:54,930 --> 00:45:56,765
No, no, I just, you know...

854
00:45:58,309 --> 00:46:03,355
Sometimes Nic can be a little critical
'cause she's a perfectionist.

855
00:46:03,439 --> 00:46:05,565
Well, I don't see why
you'd take it that way.

856
00:46:05,649 --> 00:46:08,151
I think you're
really talented.

857
00:46:09,653 --> 00:46:11,071
Really?

858
00:46:11,155 --> 00:46:12,364
Really.

859
00:46:16,452 --> 00:46:17,744
Excuse me, senora?

860
00:46:17,828 --> 00:46:18,870
Yeah?

861
00:46:18,954 --> 00:46:20,497
5:00.

862
00:46:20,581 --> 00:46:21,706
Okay, thanks.

863
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,501
Same time tomorrow?

864
00:46:24,585 --> 00:46:26,503
Yeah. Same time tomorrow.

865
00:46:27,588 --> 00:46:28,838
Good night.

866
00:46:28,923 --> 00:46:31,633
Thank you. Okay,
good night. Thank you.

867
00:46:31,717 --> 00:46:32,759
Whew!

868
00:46:32,843 --> 00:46:34,594
I should get going, too.

869
00:46:35,679 --> 00:46:37,847
Same time tomorrow?

870
00:46:37,932 --> 00:46:39,724
That's mean.
Take this.

871
00:46:39,809 --> 00:46:41,142
No. Uh-uh.
I don't want it.

872
00:46:41,227 --> 00:46:42,227
Take it.
No.

873
00:46:42,311 --> 00:46:44,104
For the kids.
No. I don't want it.

874
00:46:44,188 --> 00:46:45,355
Come on.

875
00:46:45,439 --> 00:46:47,023
No. God,
you are such a pusher.

876
00:46:58,994 --> 00:46:59,994
Oh!

877
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:01,413
Wow. Okay.

878
00:47:04,667 --> 00:47:08,878
I don't know where that came from.
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. I...

879
00:47:08,963 --> 00:47:10,422
Jules.

880
00:47:10,506 --> 00:47:12,257
I'm gonna just go and...

881
00:47:12,341 --> 00:47:13,550
It's okay.

882
00:47:13,634 --> 00:47:14,759
No, I just...

883
00:47:14,844 --> 00:47:17,053
It's okay.
It was okay.

884
00:47:19,306 --> 00:47:21,015
But I shall return!

885
00:47:31,235 --> 00:47:32,652
What?

886
00:47:37,199 --> 00:47:38,533
So how'd it go
with Paul today?

887
00:47:38,617 --> 00:47:40,034
What do you mean?

888
00:47:40,119 --> 00:47:44,914
Well, did you break ground? Did you
dig in? I don't know the terms.

889
00:47:44,999 --> 00:47:48,042
We just talked,
conceptually.

890
00:47:48,127 --> 00:47:49,377
Oh, wow.

891
00:47:50,629 --> 00:47:54,132
So it was less of a
"doing" day? Was he okay with that?

892
00:47:56,010 --> 00:47:59,637
You know, I think
we should lay off the Paul digs a little.

893
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:02,515
Oh, okay.

894
00:48:09,398 --> 00:48:12,275
And I also think
we should start composting.

895
00:48:17,114 --> 00:48:19,991
Hey, take this.

896
00:48:20,075 --> 00:48:21,159
Thanks.

897
00:48:21,243 --> 00:48:23,119
You got that fair skin.

898
00:48:24,830 --> 00:48:27,582
You don't have
my peasant blood.

899
00:48:31,962 --> 00:48:33,338
Ignore.

900
00:48:33,422 --> 00:48:34,714
Who's that?

901
00:48:34,798 --> 00:48:38,218
My mom, Nic.
She's driving me crazy.

902
00:48:38,302 --> 00:48:40,428
Yeah? What's she doing?

903
00:48:40,513 --> 00:48:42,722
She's treating me
like I'm 12.

904
00:48:42,806 --> 00:48:44,682
It's like she doesn't want to admit
that I'm an adult.

905
00:48:44,767 --> 00:48:47,644
Well, that's your mom.
That's her job.

906
00:48:47,728 --> 00:48:50,897
What? To smother me to death?
That's not her job.

907
00:48:51,941 --> 00:48:55,026
If you want things
to be different, you got to do that,

908
00:48:55,110 --> 00:48:57,278
make that happen yourself.

909
00:48:57,363 --> 00:48:58,947
That's your job.

910
00:49:00,115 --> 00:49:01,074
Yeah.

911
00:49:01,158 --> 00:49:02,242
Do you like peppers?

912
00:49:02,326 --> 00:49:03,368
Yeah.

913
00:49:04,703 --> 00:49:05,912
Thanks.

914
00:49:08,749 --> 00:49:11,209
There's no way,
dude. You missed it by, like, 20 feet.

915
00:49:11,293 --> 00:49:13,086
Well, if Paul wasn't there,
I could have made it.

916
00:49:13,170 --> 00:49:14,879
That guy creeps me out.

917
00:49:14,964 --> 00:49:17,715
He's kind of a fag, dude,
trying to act like your dad and shit.

918
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:19,592
Whatever, all right?

919
00:49:22,972 --> 00:49:25,306
Hey, buddy. Hey.

920
00:49:26,058 --> 00:49:27,934
I've seen this dog around here before.
I think he's lost.

921
00:49:28,018 --> 00:49:29,978
Let's pee on his head.

922
00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:32,438
What? No.

923
00:49:32,523 --> 00:49:33,690
Where you going?

924
00:49:33,774 --> 00:49:34,899
Dude, what are you doing?

925
00:49:34,984 --> 00:49:36,234
Dude, just hold him.

926
00:49:36,318 --> 00:49:37,443
Dude, quit it.

927
00:49:38,195 --> 00:49:39,529
"Dude, quit it."

928
00:49:40,239 --> 00:49:42,740
Go on, get out of here! Go!

929
00:49:43,492 --> 00:49:44,951
Why are you such a fag?

930
00:49:46,453 --> 00:49:48,580
Why are you such
a fucking dick?

931
00:50:02,469 --> 00:50:04,387
That hat looks
good on you. Thanks.

932
00:50:04,471 --> 00:50:06,347
Keep it.
Thank you.

933
00:50:07,349 --> 00:50:08,349
Never been on a bike?

934
00:50:08,434 --> 00:50:09,434
Mmm-mmm.

935
00:50:10,519 --> 00:50:11,603
Never.

936
00:50:11,687 --> 00:50:13,146
You got to wear
one of these.

937
00:50:19,111 --> 00:50:20,111
Okay.

938
00:50:20,195 --> 00:50:21,863
You've got to hold on
tight right there.

939
00:50:26,493 --> 00:50:28,286
Here we go. You ready?

940
00:50:28,370 --> 00:50:29,495
I'm ready.
You sure?

941
00:50:29,580 --> 00:50:31,080
Yeah.

942
00:51:11,038 --> 00:51:14,165
Hey, babe, relax.
She'll be back when she gets back.

943
00:51:14,249 --> 00:51:16,584
Quit telling me
to relax. Okay?

944
00:51:24,551 --> 00:51:25,593
What the fuck?

945
00:51:36,021 --> 00:51:39,524
Wow. Funny how someone
conveniently forgot to tell me

946
00:51:39,608 --> 00:51:42,610
that they were driving home
on a motorcycle.

947
00:51:44,446 --> 00:51:47,365
Do you know how many people I've
seen come into the hospital paralyzed

948
00:51:47,449 --> 00:51:48,866
from motorcycle accidents?

949
00:51:48,951 --> 00:51:50,702
I'm a very safe driver, Nic.

950
00:51:50,786 --> 00:51:54,622
Yeah, that is so not the point that
I'm making, Paul.

951
00:51:54,707 --> 00:51:56,958
Joni knows that this is something
I'd just never allow.

952
00:51:57,042 --> 00:51:58,209
Mom, I'm 18 years old.

953
00:51:58,293 --> 00:51:59,335
Yeah?

954
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:01,170
I won't even be living
here in, like, a month.

955
00:52:01,296 --> 00:52:02,880
Yeah, well, you're living here now.
Yeah?

956
00:52:02,965 --> 00:52:05,925
Well, why don't you get a jump on it and
pretend like I'm not?

957
00:52:12,182 --> 00:52:15,059
She's never talked
to me like that before.

958
00:52:15,144 --> 00:52:17,937
You know, if you backed off a little bit
on the restrictions,

959
00:52:18,021 --> 00:52:20,815
you probably wouldn't
have so much conflict.

960
00:52:20,899 --> 00:52:24,736
Oh, really? You think so, Paul?
Is that how it works?

961
00:52:24,820 --> 00:52:25,862
What's going on?

962
00:52:25,946 --> 00:52:27,572
Oh, nothing. Nothing.

963
00:52:27,656 --> 00:52:30,742
Paul's just giving me some
child-rearing lessons.

964
00:52:30,826 --> 00:52:31,826
I'm just saying...

965
00:52:31,910 --> 00:52:35,747
Listen, when you've been a parent for
18 years, you come and talk to me, okay?

966
00:52:35,831 --> 00:52:37,415
I'm just making
an observation.

967
00:52:37,499 --> 00:52:41,669
Yeah? Well, I need your observations
like I need a dick in my ass!

968
00:53:06,528 --> 00:53:07,612
Joni?

969
00:53:12,326 --> 00:53:15,536
Honey. Look,
I was upset, okay?

970
00:53:15,621 --> 00:53:17,747
You know how I feel
about motorcycles.

971
00:53:17,831 --> 00:53:20,124
Yeah, I know how
you feel about them.

972
00:53:20,209 --> 00:53:23,586
But I'm an adult now,
and you have to respect that, okay?

973
00:53:23,670 --> 00:53:25,046
Good night.

974
00:53:45,484 --> 00:53:46,484
Good? Good?

975
00:53:46,568 --> 00:53:47,693
Yeah, that's perfect.
Thanks.

976
00:54:06,588 --> 00:54:07,964
Hey, Paul.

977
00:54:09,675 --> 00:54:11,759
Hey, Jules.
What's up?

978
00:54:11,844 --> 00:54:16,681
It's all right. I just wanted to say
I'm sorry about last night.

979
00:54:16,765 --> 00:54:18,307
Hey...
I was really embarrassed.

980
00:54:18,392 --> 00:54:22,186
Hey, it wasn't you.
It was her who wigged out.

981
00:54:22,271 --> 00:54:24,564
I think she's, you know,
she's just having a really hard time.

982
00:54:24,648 --> 00:54:26,691
You know?

983
00:54:26,775 --> 00:54:29,235
Yeah. You really don't
have to defend her. Seriously.

984
00:54:29,319 --> 00:54:32,363
And about that kiss, that's...
You know, I don't do that.

985
00:54:32,447 --> 00:54:33,823
I completely
sensed that, yeah.

986
00:54:33,907 --> 00:54:35,408
So...

987
00:54:35,492 --> 00:54:38,786
I just wanted
to clear the air.

988
00:54:38,871 --> 00:54:40,246
The air is cleared.

989
00:54:40,330 --> 00:54:41,873
No, it's clear.

990
00:54:51,633 --> 00:54:52,717
No, Paul, I can't!

991
00:54:52,801 --> 00:54:54,010
Why? You don't want to?

992
00:54:54,094 --> 00:54:55,428
No, I have a guy outside!

993
00:54:55,512 --> 00:54:56,888
Oh, yeah.
Right, the guy.

994
00:55:01,977 --> 00:55:03,227
Oh, God.

995
00:55:07,691 --> 00:55:09,567
Okay, wait. Wait.

996
00:55:21,330 --> 00:55:23,581
Well! Hello!

997
00:55:24,333 --> 00:55:25,750
Yeah! Yeah!

998
00:55:25,834 --> 00:55:27,668
Okay, not so hard.
Not so hard. Okay.

999
00:55:29,463 --> 00:55:30,504
What?

1000
00:55:30,589 --> 00:55:32,006
Oh, my God!
Yeah?

1001
00:55:33,508 --> 00:55:34,842
Come on.

1002
00:55:35,719 --> 00:55:37,053
Excuse me?

1003
00:55:37,930 --> 00:55:39,972
You gotta be
fucking kidding me!

1004
00:55:40,057 --> 00:55:41,265
Oh, God. Oh, God.

1005
00:55:41,350 --> 00:55:42,600
Excuse me, senora?

1006
00:55:42,684 --> 00:55:46,854
I can't fucking believe it.
Okay.

1007
00:55:46,939 --> 00:55:50,274
You gotta go talk to him.
Are you gonna go talk to him?

1008
00:55:50,359 --> 00:55:52,360
Okay. Fuck.
Oh, God.

1009
00:55:54,237 --> 00:55:55,529
Shit.

1010
00:55:56,740 --> 00:55:58,741
Excuse me, senora?
Okay!

1011
00:56:01,536 --> 00:56:03,204
Hey, what's up?

1012
00:56:04,790 --> 00:56:06,749
Where do you
want the stones?

1013
00:56:06,833 --> 00:56:08,042
Stones?

1014
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:11,087
Over by the fence.

1015
00:56:13,340 --> 00:56:14,423
What?

1016
00:56:15,968 --> 00:56:17,969
I was using the bathroom.

1017
00:56:19,471 --> 00:56:21,389
Do you need to use
the bathroom?

1018
00:56:23,183 --> 00:56:25,309
Okay, then.
I'll be right back.

1019
00:56:25,394 --> 00:56:27,186
Okay.
Take your time.

1020
00:56:32,150 --> 00:56:33,275
That's H.

1021
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:34,777
Yeah, I know.

1022
00:56:34,861 --> 00:56:35,945
All right. Lay-up.

1023
00:56:36,029 --> 00:56:37,488
All right.

1024
00:56:37,572 --> 00:56:41,075
Now you don't have
to go easy on me because you're winning.

1025
00:56:42,577 --> 00:56:44,787
Nobody likes
a show-off, man.

1026
00:56:46,581 --> 00:56:48,040
You gotta go
behind the back.

1027
00:56:48,125 --> 00:56:49,208
God.

1028
00:56:54,923 --> 00:56:57,091
Can I ask you a question?

1029
00:56:58,677 --> 00:57:00,761
Would you rather
be buried or cremated?

1030
00:57:02,180 --> 00:57:03,681
That's your question?

1031
00:57:03,765 --> 00:57:05,599
I'd rather be cremated.

1032
00:57:06,643 --> 00:57:08,644
I think I'd...

1033
00:57:09,771 --> 00:57:11,689
I think I'd rather
be buried.

1034
00:57:11,773 --> 00:57:13,441
But why? I mean,

1035
00:57:13,525 --> 00:57:15,401
you're just gonna be
taking up more space in the earth.

1036
00:57:15,485 --> 00:57:17,028
I don't know. The idea of being,
you know,

1037
00:57:17,112 --> 00:57:21,699
torched into a chalky white substance
has got me a little freaked out.

1038
00:57:21,783 --> 00:57:24,118
Why does it matter to you?
You're not even gonna be conscious.

1039
00:57:24,202 --> 00:57:26,537
Okay, well, maybe,
I don't know,

1040
00:57:26,621 --> 00:57:28,956
I want a place for people to come
and visit me one day.

1041
00:57:29,041 --> 00:57:30,207
But why?
You're gonna be dead.

1042
00:57:30,292 --> 00:57:32,084
You won't even
know they're there.

1043
00:57:36,298 --> 00:57:38,007
Okay. Take it easy.

1044
00:57:39,426 --> 00:57:40,885
Come on.

1045
00:57:40,969 --> 00:57:43,846
So, what do you like better,
Nike or New Balance?

1046
00:57:43,930 --> 00:57:46,015
Nike.
Oh, God, here we go.

1047
00:57:49,061 --> 00:57:51,228
God, I love your
necklace! Can I see it?

1048
00:57:51,313 --> 00:57:52,897
Sure.

1049
00:57:52,981 --> 00:57:54,857
It's so beautiful.

1050
00:57:54,941 --> 00:57:56,275
Thank you.

1051
00:57:56,359 --> 00:57:57,526
Is it African?

1052
00:57:57,611 --> 00:57:59,570
Yes, it's Ethiopian.

1053
00:57:59,654 --> 00:58:00,696
Did you get it there?

1054
00:58:00,781 --> 00:58:03,616
No, I got it at a flea market
in Brooklyn.

1055
00:58:05,327 --> 00:58:06,452
Is that where you're from?

1056
00:58:06,536 --> 00:58:08,245
No, I'm from here.

1057
00:58:10,290 --> 00:58:11,957
Cool.
Hey, guys, how you doing?

1058
00:58:12,042 --> 00:58:13,417
Good.
How's the food?

1059
00:58:13,502 --> 00:58:14,502
It's great.

1060
00:58:14,586 --> 00:58:15,753
Good? You're not
gonna eat your chicken?

1061
00:58:15,837 --> 00:58:17,421
It's so yummy.
It's good?

1062
00:58:17,506 --> 00:58:18,631
Yeah, it's really good.

1063
00:58:18,715 --> 00:58:23,761
I'm sorry, but I have to take the lovely
Tanya away for a moment.

1064
00:58:23,845 --> 00:58:26,263
All right. It was lovely
talking to you, ladies.

1065
00:58:26,348 --> 00:58:28,182
You, too.
You, too.

1066
00:58:33,146 --> 00:58:37,775
Okay, I'm sorry, but your donor daddy
is giving me the sex vibe.

1067
00:58:37,859 --> 00:58:39,944
No, he's not.
He wouldn't do that.

1068
00:58:40,028 --> 00:58:42,446
Why not?
He's not my dad.

1069
00:58:42,531 --> 00:58:45,241
God, Sasha,
that's totally gross!

1070
00:58:45,325 --> 00:58:48,452
Not everybody
wants to have sex with you, okay?

1071
00:58:48,537 --> 00:58:51,580
Especially when
you act like a slut.

1072
00:58:51,665 --> 00:58:52,748
Fuck you.

1073
00:58:52,833 --> 00:58:56,127
Well, it makes you seem insecure
and desperate.

1074
00:58:56,211 --> 00:58:58,462
I'm not insecure
and desperate.

1075
00:58:58,547 --> 00:59:01,257
I'm just a normal,
sexual person.

1076
00:59:01,341 --> 00:59:05,136
Maybe you'd understand that
if you weren't so uptight.

1077
00:59:05,220 --> 00:59:08,097
Fuck you.
I'm not uptight.

1078
00:59:12,477 --> 00:59:14,770
Oh, my God,
these heirloom tomatoes are amazing.

1079
00:59:14,855 --> 00:59:16,397
Oh, yeah,
they're in season.

1080
00:59:16,481 --> 00:59:18,607
You know, Joni brought some home from
Paul's garden the other day.

1081
00:59:18,692 --> 00:59:20,192
They were huge.

1082
00:59:20,277 --> 00:59:22,528
So the kids have
been spending time with him?

1083
00:59:22,612 --> 00:59:26,907
Yeah. Yeah, they're
spending all kinds of quality time together.

1084
00:59:26,992 --> 00:59:29,827
Well, you're lucky. You're lucky that
the kids bonded with the donor.

1085
00:59:29,911 --> 00:59:31,745
I mean, you hear so
many nightmare stories.

1086
00:59:31,830 --> 00:59:35,875
No, no, it's great.
They all just get along famously.

1087
00:59:35,959 --> 00:59:37,751
Apparently, Paul
can do no wrong.

1088
00:59:37,836 --> 00:59:41,630
Excuse me. Could we get
another bottle of the Seavey Cabernet?

1089
00:59:41,756 --> 00:59:43,257
Thank you. I'm okay. I'm okay.
I don't need any more.

1090
00:59:43,341 --> 00:59:46,051
Yeah, you're alone
on this one, Nicole.

1091
00:59:47,262 --> 00:59:51,307
Hey, so have you guys gotten into the
whole acai smoothie craze?

1092
00:59:51,391 --> 00:59:52,558
Acai fruit packs.

1093
00:59:52,642 --> 00:59:56,520
Yeah. No, but they're pushing them like
crack at Whole Foods.

1094
00:59:56,605 --> 00:59:59,273
Joel is so addicted to it.
He buys it by the case.

1095
00:59:59,399 --> 01:00:00,691
Here's what I do.

1096
01:00:00,775 --> 01:00:06,197
I throw one in the blender with bananas,
frozen strawberries and hemp milk.

1097
01:00:06,281 --> 01:00:08,782
And I'll tell you what,
it is pretty sensational.

1098
01:00:08,867 --> 01:00:10,784
Just fucking kill me.
Okay?

1099
01:00:10,869 --> 01:00:12,620
Honey.
I'm sorry, guys,

1100
01:00:12,704 --> 01:00:17,833
but I just can't with the fucking hemp milk
and the organic farming.

1101
01:00:17,918 --> 01:00:21,170
And, you know, if I hear one more person
say that they love heirloom tomatoes,

1102
01:00:21,254 --> 01:00:23,214
I'm gonna fucking
kill myself. Okay?

1103
01:00:23,298 --> 01:00:26,383
Oh. And do you know
that we're composting now?

1104
01:00:26,468 --> 01:00:29,470
Oh, yeah.
"No, don't throw that in the trash.

1105
01:00:29,554 --> 01:00:31,805
"You have to put it
in the composting bin

1106
01:00:31,890 --> 01:00:37,394
"where all the beautiful little worms will
turn it into this organic mulch,

1107
01:00:37,479 --> 01:00:40,481
"and then we'll all
feel good about ourselves." You know?

1108
01:00:40,565 --> 01:00:43,484
I can't do it, okay?
I can't fucking do it.

1109
01:00:46,238 --> 01:00:49,323
Hey, babe. How about
some green tea?

1110
01:00:49,991 --> 01:00:54,370
You know what, Jules?
I like my wine, okay? So fucking sue me.

1111
01:00:54,454 --> 01:00:57,915
And FYI, red wine
has a chemical called resveratrol in it,

1112
01:00:57,999 --> 01:01:01,252
which has been proven
to significantly extend human lifespan.

1113
01:01:01,336 --> 01:01:04,964
If you drink, like,
a thousand glasses a day, yeah.

1114
01:01:05,048 --> 01:01:06,715
Fuck you.

1115
01:01:13,014 --> 01:01:14,598
I'm sorry.
It's okay.

1116
01:01:14,683 --> 01:01:16,267
Go to her.

1117
01:01:20,605 --> 01:01:21,730
Whoa.

1118
01:01:21,815 --> 01:01:24,275
What the hell
is going on with them?

1119
01:01:30,365 --> 01:01:32,908
Oh, my God.
What is going on with you?

1120
01:01:32,993 --> 01:01:34,535
It's this whole Paul thing.

1121
01:01:34,619 --> 01:01:37,037
It's just driving me
crazy, all right?

1122
01:01:37,122 --> 01:01:38,998
I feel like he's taking over
my family.

1123
01:01:39,082 --> 01:01:40,374
No. He's...

1124
01:01:40,458 --> 01:01:41,709
Can I get you anything?

1125
01:01:41,793 --> 01:01:44,211
No thanks, no.
He's not. He's not.

1126
01:01:46,381 --> 01:01:47,464
Okay.

1127
01:01:48,758 --> 01:01:50,884
Okay, I'm sorry,
all right?

1128
01:01:52,887 --> 01:01:55,014
I guess I'm just exhausted.

1129
01:01:56,558 --> 01:01:59,977
Yeah, maybe you just
need to take some time off, recharge.

1130
01:02:00,061 --> 01:02:01,145
Right?

1131
01:02:01,229 --> 01:02:02,980
Yeah, right.
Who's gonna pay for that?

1132
01:02:05,233 --> 01:02:06,859
I mean, look,
I'm sorry,

1133
01:02:06,943 --> 01:02:09,320
but, you know, I feel
like I'm carrying the whole load here.

1134
01:02:09,404 --> 01:02:11,989
Yeah, 'cause that's
the way you like it.

1135
01:02:12,073 --> 01:02:13,574
That's the way
you keep control.

1136
01:02:14,409 --> 01:02:15,367
What are you
talking about?

1137
01:02:15,452 --> 01:02:17,828
Come on,
you hated it when I worked.

1138
01:02:17,912 --> 01:02:19,580
You wanted me at home
taking care of the kids.

1139
01:02:19,664 --> 01:02:21,498
You wanted a wife.
That is just not true.

1140
01:02:21,583 --> 01:02:23,125
No, you didn't like
any of the nannies,

1141
01:02:23,209 --> 01:02:25,002
and you sure didn't
back my career.

1142
01:02:25,086 --> 01:02:29,340
What are you talking about? I just
helped you start another business.

1143
01:02:29,424 --> 01:02:32,426
Yeah, so you can feel
better about yourself.

1144
01:02:33,762 --> 01:02:37,806
No, Jules.
So you can feel better about yourself.

1145
01:02:39,768 --> 01:02:42,394
Are you even attracted
to me anymore?

1146
01:02:43,980 --> 01:02:46,565
Would you
still like the wine?

1147
01:02:46,649 --> 01:02:50,569
No, thank you. We'll just take the
check from inside, please.

1148
01:02:50,653 --> 01:02:52,279
Okay, no problem.

1149
01:02:54,908 --> 01:02:56,700
Oh, yeah. Pull my hair.

1150
01:02:56,785 --> 01:02:58,577
Okay. Oh, yeah.

1151
01:03:01,039 --> 01:03:02,122
Okay.

1152
01:03:02,207 --> 01:03:03,207
Ow!

1153
01:03:14,302 --> 01:03:19,056
I really want a cigarette.
I haven't smoked since Laser was born.

1154
01:03:21,226 --> 01:03:22,559
Do you smoke?
Do you have a cigarette?

1155
01:03:22,644 --> 01:03:24,103
Sometimes,
but I don't have any.

1156
01:03:24,187 --> 01:03:25,813
I could go run out
and get you some.

1157
01:03:25,897 --> 01:03:29,066
Yeah. Yeah, no, no.
No, don't go.

1158
01:03:31,486 --> 01:03:32,569
God.

1159
01:03:34,823 --> 01:03:36,740
Do you think

1160
01:03:36,825 --> 01:03:40,160
I'm some sad-sack,
middle-aged lesbian?

1161
01:03:41,162 --> 01:03:45,124
You know, I have been trying to come up
with a way to describe you to my friends,

1162
01:03:45,208 --> 01:03:46,667
and now I finally have it.
Thank you so much.

1163
01:03:48,002 --> 01:03:50,170
Fuck you.

1164
01:03:51,339 --> 01:03:52,589
You want to get that?

1165
01:03:52,674 --> 01:03:54,383
No, no. I want
to get some of this.

1166
01:03:55,552 --> 01:03:56,677
Paul, it's Joni.

1167
01:03:56,761 --> 01:04:00,931
I just wanted to call you
and apologize for my friend Sasha.

1168
01:04:01,015 --> 01:04:03,350
You know, when you put
your hands on her shoulders,

1169
01:04:03,435 --> 01:04:05,018
I think that
she thought that...

1170
01:04:05,103 --> 01:04:06,770
Hey, Joni. It's Paul.
Don't get that.

1171
01:04:06,855 --> 01:04:08,772
Listen, I'm really sorry
about Sasha the other night.

1172
01:04:08,857 --> 01:04:13,235
No, I didn't even... No, no. No...
Really, I didn't even notice that.

1173
01:04:13,319 --> 01:04:14,278
I hope you didn't
feel uncomfortable.

1174
01:04:14,362 --> 01:04:17,030
No, not at all. I...

1175
01:04:17,866 --> 01:04:18,949
Not at all.

1176
01:04:19,033 --> 01:04:21,034
Okay, sure.
Well, as long as... Hold on, hold on.

1177
01:04:21,119 --> 01:04:22,286
Wait, wait, wait.

1178
01:04:22,370 --> 01:04:23,787
No, just get off me.

1179
01:04:23,872 --> 01:04:25,080
I'm just gonna...
Give me one second.

1180
01:04:25,165 --> 01:04:26,957
Get off.

1181
01:04:28,042 --> 01:04:29,084
Jone?

1182
01:04:29,169 --> 01:04:30,419
Oh, is my mom there?

1183
01:04:30,503 --> 01:04:33,672
Your mom?
No, no. She split.

1184
01:04:33,756 --> 01:04:35,966
She went on
a Home Depot run.

1185
01:04:43,433 --> 01:04:44,641
Did you go to Home Depot?

1186
01:04:44,726 --> 01:04:46,810
Yeah. Just got back.

1187
01:04:48,563 --> 01:04:50,606
That was fast.

1188
01:04:50,690 --> 01:04:52,232
Yeah, no lines.

1189
01:04:58,072 --> 01:05:00,449
What's that look
you're giving me?

1190
01:05:00,533 --> 01:05:01,617
What look?

1191
01:05:01,701 --> 01:05:05,120
The look that you're
giving me right now.

1192
01:05:05,205 --> 01:05:09,082
No. That's no look.
That's just my face.

1193
01:05:09,167 --> 01:05:12,336
Yeah, I'm not gonna play
this game with you.

1194
01:05:12,420 --> 01:05:14,838
You know, you can
keep your judgments to yourself.

1195
01:05:14,923 --> 01:05:17,132
No. I didn't give
no looks, senora.

1196
01:05:17,217 --> 01:05:19,801
I don't ask
why you blow your nose all the time.

1197
01:05:19,886 --> 01:05:21,929
If you have a drug problem,
then that's your business.

1198
01:05:22,013 --> 01:05:24,640
No, I don't have
no drug problem.

1199
01:05:24,724 --> 01:05:25,724
I have allergies.

1200
01:05:25,808 --> 01:05:28,519
Then why are
you a gardener?

1201
01:05:28,603 --> 01:05:30,771
'Cause I love
the flowers.

1202
01:05:31,940 --> 01:05:33,524
Man, this is
not gonna work.

1203
01:05:33,608 --> 01:05:35,776
You know, I'm gonna pay you
through the end of the day,

1204
01:05:35,860 --> 01:05:38,195
and then we're through. Okay?

1205
01:05:39,572 --> 01:05:40,697
Thank you very much.

1206
01:05:40,782 --> 01:05:42,449
Thanks. Thank you.

1207
01:05:45,662 --> 01:05:46,703
Can we talk about...

1208
01:05:46,788 --> 01:05:47,871
No, we can't.

1209
01:05:47,956 --> 01:05:49,540
A little bit.
You know why?

1210
01:05:49,624 --> 01:05:51,083
'Cause there's nothing
to talk about.

1211
01:05:51,167 --> 01:05:52,960
I think you know.

1212
01:05:54,712 --> 01:05:55,963
You know.

1213
01:06:42,802 --> 01:06:43,885
Look.

1214
01:06:45,346 --> 01:06:48,223
I know you've all
been enjoying your time with Paul.

1215
01:06:48,308 --> 01:06:53,270
And I know that I haven't
been as open to him as everybody else,

1216
01:06:53,354 --> 01:06:55,522
and that's caused some
friction between us.

1217
01:06:55,607 --> 01:06:59,443
But I'd like to try
and change that, okay?

1218
01:06:59,527 --> 01:07:01,445
So I was thinking

1219
01:07:01,529 --> 01:07:04,656
it might be nice if we all had dinner at
his house sometime.

1220
01:07:04,741 --> 01:07:07,034
Now that way, I could get to know him
a little bit better,

1221
01:07:07,118 --> 01:07:11,955
and I could see all the good work
that Mom's been doing in the backyard.

1222
01:07:14,375 --> 01:07:15,959
What do you think? Yeah?
Sure.

1223
01:07:16,044 --> 01:07:17,127
Yeah.
Sure.

1224
01:07:17,211 --> 01:07:18,295
Yeah?

1225
01:07:18,379 --> 01:07:19,463
Yeah.

1226
01:07:19,547 --> 01:07:20,672
Great.

1227
01:07:20,757 --> 01:07:23,091
It's not...
I'm not done yet.

1228
01:07:23,176 --> 01:07:24,259
You know,
I'm not, you know...

1229
01:07:24,344 --> 01:07:25,510
No. No, I know.

1230
01:07:25,595 --> 01:07:27,512
I haven't done all
the planting or anything.

1231
01:07:27,597 --> 01:07:28,972
But I wanna see
the process.

1232
01:07:29,057 --> 01:07:31,266
You know, like other colors,
other than green colors.

1233
01:07:31,351 --> 01:07:34,144
Well, that's okay.
I just wanna see the process.

1234
01:07:34,228 --> 01:07:35,729
Great.

1235
01:07:38,524 --> 01:07:39,566
Hey.

1236
01:07:41,903 --> 01:07:43,612
Need a hand?
Sure.

1237
01:07:49,077 --> 01:07:50,577
Hold on.
Let me help you.

1238
01:07:50,662 --> 01:07:52,621
Ready? Okay.

1239
01:07:52,705 --> 01:07:54,081
Right here.

1240
01:07:56,459 --> 01:07:57,542
Yeah.

1241
01:08:04,425 --> 01:08:05,634
We can't be doing this.

1242
01:08:05,718 --> 01:08:08,345
I know. This is...

1243
01:08:08,429 --> 01:08:09,763
I'm married.

1244
01:08:09,847 --> 01:08:11,139
The kids.

1245
01:08:11,224 --> 01:08:13,475
Yeah, and I love Nic, so...

1246
01:08:13,559 --> 01:08:15,143
Hey.
I don't...

1247
01:08:15,228 --> 01:08:16,812
It was fun while it lasted.

1248
01:08:17,563 --> 01:08:18,730
Sorry.

1249
01:08:23,152 --> 01:08:25,862
I bought you
some cigarettes.

1250
01:08:25,947 --> 01:08:29,783
Jesus. What is
wrong with me?

1251
01:08:31,494 --> 01:08:34,663
I shouldn't have fired Luis like that.
That was so wrong.

1252
01:08:34,747 --> 01:08:36,873
Yeah, I think you're
being hard on yourself.

1253
01:08:36,958 --> 01:08:39,418
You know, I mean,
things just get messed up sometimes.

1254
01:08:39,502 --> 01:08:43,630
No, no, that wasn't messy.
That was fucked up.

1255
01:08:45,925 --> 01:08:48,135
I am so fucked up.

1256
01:08:50,805 --> 01:08:51,847
I...

1257
01:08:53,808 --> 01:08:56,101
I think
I'm falling for you.

1258
01:08:57,979 --> 01:08:59,479
Oh, God, Paul.

1259
01:09:01,065 --> 01:09:02,232
Don't.

1260
01:09:27,508 --> 01:09:28,967
Tonight was
a really good night.

1261
01:09:29,051 --> 01:09:30,093
Yeah.

1262
01:09:30,178 --> 01:09:33,638
That one table had, like,
five bottles of wine.

1263
01:09:35,016 --> 01:09:37,684
It was crazy.
It was a big night.

1264
01:09:38,269 --> 01:09:40,604
You know,
Joni's really pretty.

1265
01:09:40,688 --> 01:09:43,106
I think she's got
some of your genes.

1266
01:09:43,191 --> 01:09:45,776
You think? I think she looks more like
her mom, but thanks.

1267
01:09:45,860 --> 01:09:47,110
I appreciate that.

1268
01:09:47,779 --> 01:09:50,197
It was really cute
seeing you in Dad mode.

1269
01:09:50,281 --> 01:09:51,531
Yeah?

1270
01:09:52,700 --> 01:09:54,576
Yeah.

1271
01:09:54,660 --> 01:09:56,661
It made me want
to fuck you.

1272
01:09:57,789 --> 01:09:58,914
Yeah?

1273
01:09:58,998 --> 01:10:00,040
Yeah.

1274
01:10:00,124 --> 01:10:03,752
You know, I've been
missing our sleepovers.

1275
01:10:03,836 --> 01:10:07,214
Yeah, we haven't
been doing that in a while, have we?

1276
01:10:07,340 --> 01:10:08,840
Mmm-mmm.

1277
01:10:11,260 --> 01:10:12,719
You want to meet up later?

1278
01:10:13,971 --> 01:10:15,388
Tanya,

1279
01:10:16,891 --> 01:10:19,893
you're so sexy
and beautiful, but I...

1280
01:10:21,437 --> 01:10:24,272
I don't think
we should do that anymore.

1281
01:10:25,441 --> 01:10:28,443
You know,
what we have is really fun and easy,

1282
01:10:28,528 --> 01:10:32,614
but I don't want to be that, like, 50- year-
old guy who's just hanging out, you know?

1283
01:10:32,698 --> 01:10:34,533
I really do want
to have a family,

1284
01:10:34,617 --> 01:10:39,246
and I need to be doing that with someone
who's, like, ready to go there with me.

1285
01:10:39,997 --> 01:10:41,164
Oh.

1286
01:10:45,086 --> 01:10:46,169
Okay.

1287
01:10:48,339 --> 01:10:49,506
Tanya.

1288
01:10:55,388 --> 01:10:57,848
Yeah? Fuck you.

1289
01:11:23,499 --> 01:11:24,916
It's locked.

1290
01:11:33,259 --> 01:11:36,386
Yeah, I mean, obviously I have
more to do down here.

1291
01:11:36,470 --> 01:11:38,889
I gotta fill it in,
but this is the general idea.

1292
01:11:38,973 --> 01:11:41,516
No, it looks great.

1293
01:11:41,601 --> 01:11:42,601
Yeah?

1294
01:11:42,685 --> 01:11:43,727
It's so indigenous.

1295
01:11:43,811 --> 01:11:45,478
Really.
I am so proud of you.

1296
01:11:45,563 --> 01:11:48,440
Yeah, you like it?
Yeah?

1297
01:11:48,524 --> 01:11:50,150
I'm so proud.

1298
01:11:55,072 --> 01:11:56,281
I love you, honey.

1299
01:11:56,365 --> 01:11:58,158
I love you, too.

1300
01:11:58,242 --> 01:12:00,285
I'm so glad you like it.
It's incredible.

1301
01:12:00,369 --> 01:12:01,411
Oh, man.

1302
01:12:01,495 --> 01:12:03,413
And now, wait,
how's that guy Luis working out?

1303
01:12:03,497 --> 01:12:05,540
Man, I had to fire him.

1304
01:12:05,625 --> 01:12:06,625
Oh, my God.

1305
01:12:06,709 --> 01:12:08,418
Yeah, he has
a drug problem.

1306
01:12:08,502 --> 01:12:09,586
You're kidding!
What drug?

1307
01:12:09,670 --> 01:12:10,795
No. I know... I...

1308
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:11,963
Blow, I think.

1309
01:12:12,757 --> 01:12:14,424
You're a natural, kid.

1310
01:12:27,521 --> 01:12:29,314
I know.
Good.

1311
01:12:30,274 --> 01:12:31,524
You're a natural.

1312
01:12:35,446 --> 01:12:37,656
You can never have
too much olive oil.

1313
01:12:37,740 --> 01:12:38,740
Big no-no.

1314
01:12:42,578 --> 01:12:43,912
Oh! I forgot.

1315
01:12:43,996 --> 01:12:48,875
Nic, I got a bitching 1998 Alma Rosa that
I think you're just gonna love.

1316
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:51,461
You know what? I think I'm gonna stick
with water, but thank you so much.

1317
01:12:51,545 --> 01:12:53,129
You sure?
Yeah.

1318
01:12:53,214 --> 01:12:54,381
Jules.

1319
01:12:55,591 --> 01:12:56,633
Paul, this steak
is delicious.

1320
01:12:56,717 --> 01:12:57,842
Thank you.

1321
01:12:57,927 --> 01:13:00,679
Really, it's...
What is the seasoning?

1322
01:13:00,763 --> 01:13:03,974
Guys, we just misted it
with a little truffle oil, right?

1323
01:13:04,058 --> 01:13:05,058
Mmm-hmm.

1324
01:13:05,142 --> 01:13:06,476
It's so easy.
Wow.

1325
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:09,270
What a good idea.
We ought to try that. Right, honey?

1326
01:13:09,355 --> 01:13:10,355
Mmm-hmm.

1327
01:13:10,439 --> 01:13:12,148
And it's done
to perfection.

1328
01:13:12,233 --> 01:13:13,316
Yeah?
It's not too rare?

1329
01:13:13,401 --> 01:13:14,484
Oh, no, no.

1330
01:13:14,568 --> 01:13:17,946
It's juicy and tender.
Exactly what rare's supposed to be.

1331
01:13:18,030 --> 01:13:20,240
Right? I mean, I got people
coming into the restaurant,

1332
01:13:20,324 --> 01:13:23,076
they see the slightest
bit of red, they just start freaking out.

1333
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:24,995
Isn't that annoying?

1334
01:13:25,079 --> 01:13:27,205
That happens to me
all the time when I'm grilling.

1335
01:13:27,289 --> 01:13:28,456
Hey, red is rare.

1336
01:13:28,541 --> 01:13:30,083
Hello, it's bloody.

1337
01:13:30,167 --> 01:13:31,668
I mean...
Hello?

1338
01:13:31,752 --> 01:13:33,044
Yoo-hoo.
Hello, thank you.

1339
01:13:33,129 --> 01:13:36,047
Yeah, I mean, if you're in Argentina,
and you ask for rare,

1340
01:13:36,132 --> 01:13:39,259
they bring you a cow
still mooing on the plate.

1341
01:13:40,469 --> 01:13:42,846
I really want to go to Argentina. Buenos
Aires is supposed to be...

1342
01:13:42,930 --> 01:13:46,266
Hey. I noticed
your record collection over there.

1343
01:13:46,350 --> 01:13:49,019
Wow, it's quite an
eclectic mix, you know.

1344
01:13:49,103 --> 01:13:50,854
Thank you very much, Nic.

1345
01:13:50,938 --> 01:13:52,272
You're welcome.

1346
01:13:52,356 --> 01:13:54,649
You don't meet too many straight guys
who love Joni Mitchell.

1347
01:13:54,734 --> 01:13:56,568
You sure don't.

1348
01:13:56,652 --> 01:13:58,069
You like Joni?

1349
01:13:58,487 --> 01:14:02,365
No, not really. We just named our
daughter after her.

1350
01:14:02,450 --> 01:14:05,535
Really?
Oh, shut the front door.

1351
01:14:05,619 --> 01:14:08,872
Come on. Really? You never told me
you were named after Joni M.

1352
01:14:08,956 --> 01:14:10,540
It's so dorky.
I don't like to bring it up.

1353
01:14:10,624 --> 01:14:11,750
That is so cool.

1354
01:14:11,834 --> 01:14:14,627
No, what's your
favorite Joni album? It's not cool.

1355
01:14:14,837 --> 01:14:15,837
Blue.

1356
01:14:17,298 --> 01:14:20,592
Right? My brother
from another mother.

1357
01:14:20,676 --> 01:14:22,635
Oh, my God.
I mean...

1358
01:14:22,720 --> 01:14:27,390
Listen, I spent half of high school in my
room crying to that album.

1359
01:14:27,475 --> 01:14:30,435
That record,
it kills me.

1360
01:14:30,519 --> 01:14:32,103
It doesn't stop.
No.

1361
01:14:32,188 --> 01:14:35,023
River. California.

1362
01:14:35,649 --> 01:14:36,691
A Case Of You.

1363
01:14:36,776 --> 01:14:37,817
All I Want.

1364
01:14:37,943 --> 01:14:39,569
Oh, God.
Right?

1365
01:14:42,114 --> 01:14:44,282
# I am on a lonely road

1366
01:14:44,366 --> 01:14:48,787
# And I am traveling,
traveling, traveling

1367
01:14:48,871 --> 01:14:50,497
# Looking for something

1368
01:14:50,581 --> 01:14:52,999
# What can it be

1369
01:14:53,084 --> 01:14:56,544
# I hate you some,
I hate you some

1370
01:14:56,629 --> 01:14:59,756
# I love you some

1371
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:01,424
# I love you

1372
01:15:01,509 --> 01:15:04,886
# When I forget about me

1373
01:15:04,970 --> 01:15:07,055
# I want to talk to you

1374
01:15:07,139 --> 01:15:08,932
# I want to shampoo you

1375
01:15:09,016 --> 01:15:12,602
# I want to renew you
again and again

1376
01:15:12,686 --> 01:15:14,354
# Applause, applause

1377
01:15:14,438 --> 01:15:15,980
# Life is our cause

1378
01:15:16,065 --> 01:15:17,649
# When I think of your kisses

1379
01:15:17,733 --> 01:15:19,692
# My mind see-saws

1380
01:15:19,777 --> 01:15:21,528
# Do you see,
do you see

1381
01:15:26,408 --> 01:15:28,368
# Do you see, do you see

1382
01:15:28,452 --> 01:15:32,288
# Do you see how
you hurt me, baby

1383
01:15:32,748 --> 01:15:35,333
# And I hurt you, too

1384
01:15:35,417 --> 01:15:38,419
# That's why we both get

1385
01:15:38,504 --> 01:15:44,175
# so blue ##

1386
01:15:46,595 --> 01:15:48,054
Bravo.

1387
01:15:51,433 --> 01:15:53,309
Don't quit your
day job, Mom.

1388
01:15:53,394 --> 01:15:56,771
Hey. It's already hard enough to
open your heart in this world.

1389
01:15:56,856 --> 01:15:58,857
Don't make it any harder.

1390
01:15:59,817 --> 01:16:03,027
You're right. I'm sorry.
It was a wonderful rendition.

1391
01:16:03,112 --> 01:16:04,529
Beautiful, thank you.

1392
01:16:04,613 --> 01:16:05,822
I like this guy.

1393
01:16:07,908 --> 01:16:09,409
Why, thank you, Nic.

1394
01:16:15,749 --> 01:16:17,458
Okay. Paul,
where's your bathroom?

1395
01:16:17,543 --> 01:16:19,502
It's just right here
around the corner.

1396
01:16:19,587 --> 01:16:20,879
All right. Thanks.

1397
01:16:20,963 --> 01:16:26,426
And you know what? I am gonna have
a glass of the Alma Rosa, okay?

1398
01:16:26,510 --> 01:16:27,844
All right.

1399
01:16:30,681 --> 01:16:34,726
So, I think you'd
really love Argentina.

1400
01:16:34,810 --> 01:16:36,019
I really
wanna go there.

1401
01:16:36,103 --> 01:16:37,896
Buenos Aires
is literally, like,

1402
01:16:37,980 --> 01:16:41,107
one of the most beautiful
cities in the world.

1403
01:17:33,327 --> 01:17:35,536
I was in a rainstorm
in the Grand Canyon.

1404
01:17:35,621 --> 01:17:37,080
Can we go?
I'll take you.

1405
01:17:56,850 --> 01:18:01,562
A big rattlesnake
when I was in the desert in Baja, Mexico.

1406
01:18:01,647 --> 01:18:04,190
We should.
I'll take you to Baja.

1407
01:18:04,275 --> 01:18:06,317
I was in the desert and...

1408
01:18:06,402 --> 01:18:07,610
What's it like there?

1409
01:18:07,695 --> 01:18:09,404
It's beautiful.

1410
01:18:09,488 --> 01:18:12,782
I was surfing, but then
there was no waves,

1411
01:18:12,866 --> 01:18:15,451
so we climbed up
into the mountains.

1412
01:18:15,536 --> 01:18:18,788
And I hear a rattling,
and it was a rattlesnake.

1413
01:18:18,872 --> 01:18:21,874
And so I was scrambling.
I didn't know what to do,

1414
01:18:21,959 --> 01:18:26,254
so I reached out for a rock, and then
I threw it at the rattlesnake...

1415
01:18:53,574 --> 01:18:55,199
Did you guys spend
some time up there?

1416
01:18:55,284 --> 01:18:58,369
Yeah, a long time ago.
Yeah. Yeah.

1417
01:18:58,454 --> 01:19:00,663
Beautiful, beautiful beaches.
You'd like it.

1418
01:19:00,748 --> 01:19:04,292
It's really nice
having you guys over.

1419
01:19:04,376 --> 01:19:07,295
I don't entertain here
very much.

1420
01:19:07,379 --> 01:19:08,588
Cheers.

1421
01:19:10,132 --> 01:19:12,008
All right.
All right.

1422
01:19:14,094 --> 01:19:16,220
To an unconventional family.

1423
01:19:38,494 --> 01:19:41,704
You and Paul
were getting along like gang-busters.

1424
01:19:54,676 --> 01:19:57,470
You're sleeping
with him, aren't you?

1425
01:19:57,554 --> 01:19:58,638
What?

1426
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:04,477
Just be honest
with me, okay?

1427
01:20:04,561 --> 01:20:07,730
Don't make me feel crazier
than I feel right now.

1428
01:20:09,817 --> 01:20:12,402
Where is this coming from?
I don't...

1429
01:20:12,486 --> 01:20:15,571
Well, I found your hair
in his drain.

1430
01:20:21,870 --> 01:20:22,954
Because...

1431
01:20:23,038 --> 01:20:26,833
Because I was working,
and I got dirty, and I took a shower.

1432
01:20:29,086 --> 01:20:32,130
Yeah?
Did you take a nap, too?

1433
01:20:37,678 --> 01:20:39,720
Are you in love with him?

1434
01:20:42,057 --> 01:20:45,893
No.

1435
01:20:47,646 --> 01:20:49,063
Are you straight now?

1436
01:20:49,148 --> 01:20:52,316
No. It has nothing
to do with that!

1437
01:20:52,401 --> 01:20:56,362
I've just felt so far away
from you lately.

1438
01:20:56,447 --> 01:20:58,448
Oh, right.
So it's my fault?

1439
01:20:58,532 --> 01:21:00,783
No! Who said
anything about fault?

1440
01:21:00,868 --> 01:21:02,243
Just listen to me!

1441
01:21:02,327 --> 01:21:03,619
I'm listening!

1442
01:21:03,704 --> 01:21:05,663
What?

1443
01:21:05,747 --> 01:21:08,374
I just... I just...

1444
01:21:09,460 --> 01:21:10,460
I needed...

1445
01:21:10,544 --> 01:21:12,336
What? To be fucked?

1446
01:21:12,421 --> 01:21:15,798
No. Appreciated.

1447
01:21:15,883 --> 01:21:19,927
Well, it's always what
I'm not doing for you, isn't it?

1448
01:21:20,012 --> 01:21:24,849
Well, okay.
Here's what I don't do to you.

1449
01:21:24,933 --> 01:21:28,561
I don't work out my issues
by fucking other people!

1450
01:21:28,645 --> 01:21:30,646
He's not just "other people."

1451
01:21:30,731 --> 01:21:33,316
No! He's our sperm donor.

1452
01:21:33,400 --> 01:21:35,526
You couldn't have picked
a more painful way to hurt me.

1453
01:21:35,611 --> 01:21:36,819
Where are you going?

1454
01:21:36,904 --> 01:21:38,196
I need water!

1455
01:21:39,323 --> 01:21:40,323
Oh!

1456
01:21:42,242 --> 01:21:43,367
Shit!

1457
01:21:46,330 --> 01:21:47,497
Shit.

1458
01:22:15,526 --> 01:22:17,527
Joni.

1459
01:22:17,611 --> 01:22:18,736
I don't want
to talk to you.

1460
01:22:18,820 --> 01:22:20,112
Can we just talk
about what happened?

1461
01:22:20,197 --> 01:22:23,991
I said I don't
want to talk to you.

1462
01:22:24,076 --> 01:22:27,537
Okay. I understand.

1463
01:22:35,587 --> 01:22:38,214
Laser? Honey?

1464
01:22:40,968 --> 01:22:42,051
What?

1465
01:22:43,053 --> 01:22:47,431
I know that
you and Joni heard what was going on,

1466
01:22:47,516 --> 01:22:52,603
and I wanted to tell you
that what happened with me and Paul is over.

1467
01:22:53,981 --> 01:22:56,190
There's nothing
going on now.

1468
01:22:57,317 --> 01:22:58,401
Okay.

1469
01:22:58,485 --> 01:23:03,155
I know it'll probably take you a while to
process your feelings around this,

1470
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:08,077
but I just wanted to tell you that I'm here
if you ever want to talk about anything.

1471
01:23:11,164 --> 01:23:13,583
Is there anything
you want to talk about?

1472
01:23:13,667 --> 01:23:15,001
Not really.

1473
01:23:37,024 --> 01:23:38,190
How's Nic?

1474
01:23:38,275 --> 01:23:39,942
She's a mess.

1475
01:23:40,027 --> 01:23:44,405
They're not talking.
I've never seen her like that.

1476
01:23:52,998 --> 01:23:54,248
Is it him?

1477
01:23:54,333 --> 01:23:55,374
Hello?

1478
01:23:55,459 --> 01:23:57,293
Hey, darling.
How you doing?

1479
01:23:57,377 --> 01:23:59,086
You're such a phony.

1480
01:24:01,214 --> 01:24:02,298
Excuse me?

1481
01:24:02,382 --> 01:24:05,301
You act like you're
so groovy and together, but you're not.

1482
01:24:05,385 --> 01:24:08,012
You're a shitty person!

1483
01:24:08,096 --> 01:24:09,430
Oh, no.

1484
01:24:10,557 --> 01:24:11,599
What happened?

1485
01:24:12,059 --> 01:24:13,809
With my mom?

1486
01:24:15,270 --> 01:24:18,522
Listen, you gotta let me
just come and talk to you, honey, please.

1487
01:24:18,607 --> 01:24:19,732
What's wrong with you?

1488
01:24:19,816 --> 01:24:21,651
Joni, listen to me. Please...

1489
01:24:21,735 --> 01:24:23,486
Don't call me again.

1490
01:24:28,992 --> 01:24:32,620
Hey, Paul, look at these cukes.
Aren't they awesome?

1491
01:24:32,704 --> 01:24:33,746
No.

1492
01:24:34,414 --> 01:24:35,456
Fuck.

1493
01:24:36,750 --> 01:24:37,833
Fuck!

1494
01:24:39,211 --> 01:24:40,419
Hello?

1495
01:24:40,504 --> 01:24:41,962
I just talked to Joni.

1496
01:24:42,047 --> 01:24:44,090
What happened?
What's going on?

1497
01:24:44,174 --> 01:24:46,550
Nic found my hair
in your bathroom.

1498
01:24:47,344 --> 01:24:49,095
Fuck.
In the drain.

1499
01:24:49,179 --> 01:24:50,346
The other night?

1500
01:24:50,430 --> 01:24:51,597
Yeah.

1501
01:24:51,682 --> 01:24:53,307
Oh, my God.

1502
01:24:53,392 --> 01:24:54,975
Hey, you know what?

1503
01:24:55,060 --> 01:24:58,020
I just say we go for it.
I mean, it's all out in the open now.

1504
01:24:58,105 --> 01:24:59,939
I mean,
let's just do this thing.

1505
01:25:00,023 --> 01:25:01,190
Paul...

1506
01:25:01,274 --> 01:25:03,359
I don't care what you say,
Jules. We can...

1507
01:25:03,443 --> 01:25:05,486
This can work, you know.
This isn't a mistake.

1508
01:25:05,570 --> 01:25:06,570
Paul.

1509
01:25:06,655 --> 01:25:08,197
This isn't just happening
for no reason.

1510
01:25:08,281 --> 01:25:09,573
Let's get
the kids together.

1511
01:25:09,658 --> 01:25:11,701
Paul, come on.
I'm sick of this life.

1512
01:25:11,785 --> 01:25:12,993
Let's make this happen.
I'm ready.

1513
01:25:13,078 --> 01:25:14,120
I'm gay.

1514
01:25:14,204 --> 01:25:15,788
Fuck it. I wanna...

1515
01:25:15,872 --> 01:25:17,665
Jesus.

1516
01:25:18,834 --> 01:25:20,000
Hello?

1517
01:25:30,554 --> 01:25:33,305
Hey, hey.
Slow down, tiger.

1518
01:25:34,433 --> 01:25:35,641
You don't wanna get sick.

1519
01:25:35,726 --> 01:25:36,976
I'm fine.

1520
01:25:41,523 --> 01:25:44,191
Are you gonna
talk to him?

1521
01:25:44,276 --> 01:25:45,359
Yeah.

1522
01:25:51,700 --> 01:25:53,784
Hey.
Hey.

1523
01:25:57,247 --> 01:25:58,914
I like the scruff.
It's sexy.

1524
01:26:00,667 --> 01:26:01,751
Thank you.

1525
01:26:01,835 --> 01:26:04,295
Excuse me.
We're in the middle of a conversation.

1526
01:26:04,379 --> 01:26:05,880
That's okay.

1527
01:26:05,964 --> 01:26:06,922
Can I talk to you?

1528
01:26:07,007 --> 01:26:08,215
Yeah.

1529
01:26:11,136 --> 01:26:12,636
Excuse me.

1530
01:26:18,351 --> 01:26:21,854
Green chilies, queso sauce,
blue corn tortillas.

1531
01:26:21,938 --> 01:26:23,731
This is a poblano pepper.

1532
01:26:24,316 --> 01:26:25,983
So, what's up?

1533
01:27:04,564 --> 01:27:06,315
Are you okay?

1534
01:27:06,399 --> 01:27:07,525
Fine.

1535
01:27:19,996 --> 01:27:23,958
I just wanted to get another pillow.
The couch is really saggy.

1536
01:27:28,088 --> 01:27:29,296
Your back hurts?

1537
01:27:29,381 --> 01:27:31,924
Yeah. It's super achy.

1538
01:27:34,803 --> 01:27:37,263
Well, you should
take some Advil.

1539
01:27:47,732 --> 01:27:49,817
Hey, how was the party?

1540
01:27:51,403 --> 01:27:52,528
Fine.

1541
01:27:52,612 --> 01:27:55,364
Were there a lot
of people there?

1542
01:27:56,074 --> 01:27:57,241
I don't know.

1543
01:28:00,370 --> 01:28:02,162
Are you drunk, honey?

1544
01:28:02,247 --> 01:28:03,289
No.

1545
01:28:05,333 --> 01:28:08,878
Hey, did you drive
yourself home?

1546
01:28:08,962 --> 01:28:11,797
Yeah. What's the big deal?
I'm not drunk.

1547
01:28:14,134 --> 01:28:15,509
You seem drunk to me.

1548
01:28:15,594 --> 01:28:17,553
Yeah, well,
you should know.

1549
01:28:17,637 --> 01:28:18,971
What did you say to me?

1550
01:28:19,055 --> 01:28:20,931
Nothing. I'm going to bed.
Hey, honey. I...

1551
01:28:21,016 --> 01:28:25,144
What do you want from me?
I did everything you wanted!

1552
01:28:25,228 --> 01:28:28,647
I got all A's!
I got into every school I applied!

1553
01:28:28,732 --> 01:28:32,026
Now you can show everyone
what a perfect lesbian family you have!

1554
01:28:32,110 --> 01:28:33,527
Don't talk to your
mom like that!

1555
01:28:33,612 --> 01:28:36,906
You're really gonna
tell me how to act? Now?

1556
01:28:36,990 --> 01:28:38,490
You know what?
I am still your mother, and you...

1557
01:28:38,575 --> 01:28:42,119
Don't touch me!
I'm so sick of both of you!

1558
01:29:59,239 --> 01:30:01,615
Hey, did you remember
to pack the lamp I gave you?

1559
01:30:01,700 --> 01:30:02,700
Mmm-hmm.

1560
01:30:03,743 --> 01:30:05,786
Well, we can always
get stuff there, you know.

1561
01:30:05,870 --> 01:30:10,749
I mean, if your room's
too dark, or you need extra bedding or...

1562
01:30:12,460 --> 01:30:14,712
I'm not going
to Siberia, Mom.

1563
01:30:16,214 --> 01:30:19,258
I can't believe
it's your last dinner at home.

1564
01:30:21,594 --> 01:30:23,929
Are you seriously
about to cry?

1565
01:30:25,265 --> 01:30:28,475
I wish you were gay.
You'd be much more sensitive.

1566
01:30:33,606 --> 01:30:36,108
That's probably Sasha.
I'll get it.

1567
01:30:37,736 --> 01:30:39,028
How long a drive is it?

1568
01:30:39,112 --> 01:30:40,904
About eight
hours, I think.

1569
01:30:43,283 --> 01:30:44,700
What are you doing here?

1570
01:30:44,784 --> 01:30:48,328
I just needed to talk to you
before you left. Please.

1571
01:30:53,460 --> 01:30:54,793
There's nothing
to talk about.

1572
01:30:57,964 --> 01:31:00,090
I wanted to apologize again.

1573
01:31:02,010 --> 01:31:04,511
I can't tell you

1574
01:31:05,764 --> 01:31:10,017
how ashamed,
how much I regret what happened.

1575
01:31:10,101 --> 01:31:12,770
So, like, everything that
happened between us,

1576
01:31:12,854 --> 01:31:14,897
what was that?
That was just bullshit?

1577
01:31:14,981 --> 01:31:18,525
No, no.
It wasn't bullshit at all.

1578
01:31:20,361 --> 01:31:21,487
Okay?

1579
01:31:24,032 --> 01:31:27,576
I know that I don't
have much credibility right now,

1580
01:31:27,660 --> 01:31:32,581
but I really, really
care about you.

1581
01:31:35,001 --> 01:31:37,753
And I wanna know that I'm gonna be able
to see you again someday.

1582
01:31:37,837 --> 01:31:41,048
I mean, I...
Do you think that could ever happen?

1583
01:31:45,011 --> 01:31:46,512
I don't know.

1584
01:31:47,889 --> 01:31:50,516
I just wish that
you could've been...

1585
01:31:52,143 --> 01:31:53,227
What?

1586
01:31:56,314 --> 01:31:57,648
Better.

1587
01:32:04,030 --> 01:32:05,030
Oh.

1588
01:32:05,824 --> 01:32:07,116
You have got
some balls, mister.

1589
01:32:07,200 --> 01:32:08,283
Hold on, Nic.

1590
01:32:08,368 --> 01:32:10,077
No, no, no.
You hold on.

1591
01:32:10,370 --> 01:32:13,122
You know what
you did to my kids?

1592
01:32:13,206 --> 01:32:14,289
Shit.

1593
01:32:15,708 --> 01:32:20,379
Let me tell you something,
man, this is not your family.

1594
01:32:21,005 --> 01:32:22,965
This is my family!
I know that, Nic.

1595
01:32:23,049 --> 01:32:25,134
No, you don't know.

1596
01:32:25,218 --> 01:32:27,386
You don't know,
and you know why?

1597
01:32:27,470 --> 01:32:29,638
Because you're
a fucking interloper.

1598
01:32:30,390 --> 01:32:34,059
If you want a family so much,
you go out and make your own!

1599
01:33:41,085 --> 01:33:42,211
I need to say something.

1600
01:33:44,672 --> 01:33:49,760
It's no big secret
your mom and I are in hell right now, and...

1601
01:33:51,971 --> 01:33:56,141
Bottom line is,
marriage is hard.

1602
01:33:56,226 --> 01:33:57,517
It's really fucking hard.

1603
01:33:58,061 --> 01:34:00,854
Just two people

1604
01:34:00,939 --> 01:34:05,734
slogging through the shit,
year after year, getting older, changing.

1605
01:34:06,527 --> 01:34:08,779
It's a fucking
marathon, okay?

1606
01:34:09,906 --> 01:34:13,742
So, sometimes, you know,
you're together so long, that you just...

1607
01:34:13,826 --> 01:34:15,452
You stop seeing
the other person.

1608
01:34:15,536 --> 01:34:19,623
You just see
weird projections of your own junk.

1609
01:34:20,208 --> 01:34:24,795
Instead of talking
to each other, you go off the rails

1610
01:34:24,879 --> 01:34:28,882
and act grubby and make stupid choices,
which is what I did.

1611
01:34:28,967 --> 01:34:33,470
And I feel sick about it because I love you
guys, and I love your mom,

1612
01:34:34,847 --> 01:34:36,807
and that's the truth.

1613
01:34:38,351 --> 01:34:42,229
Sometimes you hurt the ones you love
the most. I don't know why.

1614
01:34:42,313 --> 01:34:45,774
You know, if I read more
Russian novels, then...

1615
01:34:49,654 --> 01:34:51,238
Anyway...

1616
01:34:56,035 --> 01:34:59,746
I just wanted to say
how sorry I am for what I did.

1617
01:35:03,001 --> 01:35:05,544
I hope you'll
forgive me eventually.

1618
01:35:10,466 --> 01:35:11,800
Thank you.

1619
01:37:36,571 --> 01:37:37,988
Oh!

1620
01:37:40,158 --> 01:37:41,533
Nice, huh?
This is big.

1621
01:37:41,617 --> 01:37:44,494
It's bigger than
I thought it would be.

1622
01:37:44,579 --> 01:37:46,163
Okay.

1623
01:37:46,289 --> 01:37:48,290
Did you remember the lamp? Thank God.
Here it is. Here.

1624
01:37:48,374 --> 01:37:49,416
Honey, where
do you want this?

1625
01:37:49,500 --> 01:37:51,251
Do you want it on your desk?
Do you want it next to the bed?

1626
01:37:51,335 --> 01:37:52,544
Guys, I've got it.

1627
01:37:52,628 --> 01:37:55,422
I think the sheets
are in here. Mom.

1628
01:37:55,506 --> 01:37:58,175
Guys, I can do it, okay?
No, no, I can do it.

1629
01:37:58,259 --> 01:37:59,301
Mom.

1630
01:37:59,385 --> 01:38:00,635
Is that...

1631
01:38:00,720 --> 01:38:03,346
Mom, I got it.
I can do it.

1632
01:38:03,431 --> 01:38:07,434
Thanks. Can I just have a minute,
please? Okay?

1633
01:38:07,518 --> 01:38:09,352
Okay.
Okay.

1634
01:38:09,437 --> 01:38:10,479
Okay?

1635
01:38:10,563 --> 01:38:11,646
Okay.

1636
01:38:12,857 --> 01:38:14,024
Great.

1637
01:39:28,808 --> 01:39:29,891
Hey.

1638
01:39:29,976 --> 01:39:31,142
Where'd you guys go?

1639
01:39:31,227 --> 01:39:32,435
We had to move the car.

1640
01:39:32,520 --> 01:39:34,312
I thought you left.

1641
01:39:35,356 --> 01:39:37,148
We wouldn't leave
without saying goodbye.

1642
01:39:37,233 --> 01:39:38,692
Give us some credit.

1643
01:39:45,074 --> 01:39:47,242
It's gonna be weird
not having you around anymore.

1644
01:39:47,326 --> 01:39:50,245
Sorry to leave you
alone with them.

1645
01:39:50,329 --> 01:39:52,247
It'll be okay.

1646
01:40:07,096 --> 01:40:08,847
Hey, guys, come on.

1647
01:40:14,020 --> 01:40:17,439
Hey, it's okay.
I'll speak to you soon, okay?

1648
01:40:23,029 --> 01:40:24,195
Okay.

1649
01:41:35,101 --> 01:41:39,062
I don't think you guys
should break up.

1650
01:41:39,146 --> 01:41:41,022
No? Why's that?

1651
01:41:43,109 --> 01:41:44,984
I think you're too old.

1652
01:41:47,905 --> 01:41:49,531
Thanks, Laser.
