1
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:38,396
<i>I'm going to tell you a story now.</i>

2
00:00:38,473 --> 00:00:40,964
<i>But as any good storyteller knows,</i>

3
00:00:41,042 --> 00:00:44,637
<i>one must first be sure
the audience is prepared.</i>

4
00:00:44,712 --> 00:00:47,112
<i>Is everybody comfortably seated?</i>

5
00:00:47,181 --> 00:00:49,445
<i>Does anyone need to use the bathroom?</i>

6
00:00:49,517 --> 00:00:52,611
<i>Oh. You, sir, in the back?</i>

7
00:00:52,687 --> 00:00:54,587
<i>Well, hold it in.</i>

8
00:00:56,924 --> 00:00:59,552
<i>You ready? Here we go.</i>

9
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:05,397
<i>My name is Marty Bronson.</i>

10
00:01:05,466 --> 00:01:09,459
<i>I owned and operated
the Sunny Vista Motel,</i>

11
00:01:09,537 --> 00:01:13,166
<i>which I established on the corner
of Sunset and La Cienega Boulevards</i>

12
00:01:13,241 --> 00:01:18,304
<i>in Los Angeles, California,
in the year 1974.</i>

13
00:01:18,379 --> 00:01:21,906
<i>The motel was my labor of love,</i>

14
00:01:21,983 --> 00:01:24,816
<i>and I ran it with the help
of my children: Wendy...</i>

15
00:01:24,886 --> 00:01:29,084
Wendy, the key, please,
for Mr. And Mrs. Dixon.

16
00:01:30,425 --> 00:01:31,414
Thank you.

17
00:01:31,492 --> 00:01:32,618
<i>And Skeeter.</i>

18
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:38,190
May I help you with your
bags, Mr. And Mrs. Dixon?

19
00:01:38,266 --> 00:01:40,734
- Yes, please.
- Why, thank you, young man.

20
00:01:45,106 --> 00:01:46,630
You, uh, need a hand?

21
00:01:46,708 --> 00:01:48,471
No, no. I got it.

22
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:50,872
OK.

23
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:56,447
<i>To my boy Skeeter, the
motel was a wonderland.</i>

24
00:01:56,517 --> 00:01:58,178
Way too hyper.

25
00:01:58,252 --> 00:02:00,812
The galaxy's not big
enough for the both of us.

26
00:02:00,888 --> 00:02:02,378
<i>A magical place.</i>

27
00:02:05,493 --> 00:02:08,929
<i>Full of new adventures
for a six-year-old boy.</i>

28
00:02:10,465 --> 00:02:13,593
Oh, Skeeter. Come here.

29
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:20,001
<i>Skeeter loved the old
place as much as I did.</i>

30
00:02:20,074 --> 00:02:23,510
<i>And he always tried to come up
with ways to make it even better.</i>

31
00:02:23,578 --> 00:02:26,877
<i>I've got a lot of ideas how
to improve things around here.</i>

32
00:02:26,948 --> 00:02:30,782
I was thinking we could put an
extra pair of socks in each room

33
00:02:30,852 --> 00:02:34,583
because people always forget to pack
enough socks when they go on a trip.

34
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:37,080
That's a good idea.

35
00:02:37,158 --> 00:02:39,558
Time for bed, I'm meeting
with Mr. Nottingham.

36
00:02:39,627 --> 00:02:42,221
<i>Wait, Dad. I'm not even tired.</i>

37
00:02:42,296 --> 00:02:45,697
Well, how about a bedtime story?

38
00:02:45,767 --> 00:02:47,098
Yay!

39
00:02:49,504 --> 00:02:54,771
Now, once upon a time,
there was a little boy,

40
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:57,470
and that little boy's name was Skeeter.

41
00:02:57,545 --> 00:03:02,278
<i>Well, I could tell a pretty fair
tale when the muse was with me.</i>

42
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:04,648
<i>And making my little boy smile,</i>

43
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:07,153
<i>now, that was truly magical.</i>

44
00:03:07,221 --> 00:03:12,158
<i>Yeah, I was a pretty good
dad and a pretty good host.</i>

45
00:03:12,226 --> 00:03:16,595
<i>But unfortunately, a
pretty bad businessman.</i>

46
00:03:16,664 --> 00:03:19,565
Can't you read the writing
on the wall, Bronson?

47
00:03:19,634 --> 00:03:22,102
This motel is sinking in red ink...

48
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:24,468
and I'm offering you the last lifeboat.

49
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:28,031
I don't know.

50
00:03:28,109 --> 00:03:30,270
<i>I've seen the books, Martin.</i>

51
00:03:30,344 --> 00:03:33,507
If you don't sell to me,
you're going to go bankrupt.

52
00:03:33,581 --> 00:03:35,378
Yes, well, I...

53
00:03:35,449 --> 00:03:38,646
I'd always hoped this place
would be a home for my children.

54
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:40,380
How about this?

55
00:03:40,454 --> 00:03:43,753
If your boy works hard and shows
some smarts when he grows up,

56
00:03:43,825 --> 00:03:45,816
I'll let him run this place.

57
00:03:46,694 --> 00:03:48,525
You promise?

58
00:03:48,596 --> 00:03:51,861
Yes. Now sign the bloody papers.

59
00:03:58,539 --> 00:04:00,507
That's my boy, Bronson.

60
00:04:00,575 --> 00:04:05,239
Trust me, I'm going to turn this place
into the finest hotel in Los Angeles.

61
00:04:05,313 --> 00:04:09,249
It's going to be
uptight and out of sight.

62
00:04:09,317 --> 00:04:14,118
<i>And just like that, our modest
little Sunny Vista Motel...</i>

63
00:04:14,188 --> 00:04:18,955
<i>... metamorphosized into the
mighty Sunny Vista Nottingham.</i>

64
00:04:19,026 --> 00:04:21,460
<i>And for the past 25 years,</i>

65
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:24,930
<i>it has been lovingly maintained
by my now grown-up son,</i>

66
00:04:24,999 --> 00:04:27,832
<i>Skeeter Bronson, the handyman.</i>

67
00:04:27,902 --> 00:04:31,201
<i>Yes, though Mr. Nottingham's
promise for Skeeter to run the place</i>

68
00:04:31,272 --> 00:04:33,797
<i>- seems to have been forgotten...
- Hiya, Pop.</i>

69
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:37,470
<i>... my boy always works
diligently with a hopeful heart,</i>

70
00:04:37,545 --> 00:04:39,410
<i>still waiting for his shot.</i>

71
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,347
Mrs. Dixon? Is there a
problem with her room?

72
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:45,112
Nothing you should bother
your tiny mind about.

73
00:04:45,186 --> 00:04:48,781
Mrs. Dixon has been taking the nip
bottles of liquor out of her mini-bar,

74
00:04:48,856 --> 00:04:50,187
and doesn't want to pay for it.

75
00:04:50,258 --> 00:04:53,250
<i>I never even touched that
evil little refrigerator.</i>

76
00:04:53,327 --> 00:04:55,227
I don't drink alcohol.

77
00:04:55,296 --> 00:04:57,230
Of course. There's probably a mix-up.

78
00:04:57,298 --> 00:04:59,664
- I saw who took it.
- OK.

79
00:04:59,734 --> 00:05:01,861
He had red hair and a beard.

80
00:05:01,936 --> 00:05:04,427
He was wearing a green
suit with brass buttons.

81
00:05:04,505 --> 00:05:06,939
And he stands about ten inches tall.

82
00:05:07,008 --> 00:05:09,602
So we're talking about a leprechaun?

83
00:05:09,677 --> 00:05:10,701
There you go.

84
00:05:10,778 --> 00:05:13,246
Oh, I didn't know your
brother was in town.

85
00:05:13,314 --> 00:05:15,544
So, um, here's what
I think we should do.

86
00:05:15,616 --> 00:05:19,052
Put all the missing bottles on my tab.

87
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,850
Next time you see any
leprechauns, we'll tell Aspen.

88
00:05:21,923 --> 00:05:22,981
She's half-troll.

89
00:05:23,057 --> 00:05:25,525
I think, trolls eat
leprechauns, am I right?

90
00:05:27,328 --> 00:05:28,590
She would.

91
00:05:30,298 --> 00:05:33,734
<i>Today magic is in the
air at the grand hotel,</i>

92
00:05:33,801 --> 00:05:36,326
<i>and the winds of change
are about to blow our story</i>

93
00:05:36,404 --> 00:05:38,702
<i>in a strange new direction.</i>

94
00:05:38,773 --> 00:05:40,707
<i>But what would you expect in a hotel</i>

95
00:05:40,775 --> 00:05:43,744
<i>founded by someone who loved
a good story as much as I?</i>

96
00:05:43,811 --> 00:05:46,109
Time is of the essence here, Skeeter.

97
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:49,911
Oh, yeah, I know. I just don't want
the big boss man to get electrocuted.

98
00:05:49,984 --> 00:05:51,315
Of course.

99
00:05:51,385 --> 00:05:54,377
- You fixed it?
- Let me see here.

100
00:05:54,455 --> 00:05:56,753
Yo, yo. Yo, yo.

101
00:05:56,824 --> 00:05:59,816
Check, check. One, two. Come on.
Yeah, yeah. Hear me in the back?

102
00:05:59,894 --> 00:06:01,486
- Whoa, whoa.
- Skeeter.

103
00:06:01,562 --> 00:06:03,621
I say "Barry," you say "Nottingham."

104
00:06:03,698 --> 00:06:05,427
- Barry.
- Nottingham.

105
00:06:05,499 --> 00:06:07,057
- Barry.
- Nottingham.

106
00:06:07,134 --> 00:06:09,261
<i>Barry had a Nottingham</i>

107
00:06:09,337 --> 00:06:11,601
<i>Nottingham, Nottingham</i>

108
00:06:11,672 --> 00:06:13,401
<i>Barry had a Nottingham</i>

109
00:06:13,474 --> 00:06:16,136
<i>Whose beard was white as snow</i>

110
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:19,077
<i>Come on, give it up for the big man.</i>

111
00:06:20,548 --> 00:06:22,072
Got them warmed up for you, sir.

112
00:06:22,149 --> 00:06:24,515
- It's good to see you again.
- Germs.

113
00:06:24,585 --> 00:06:25,609
- Germs?
- Uh, Skeeter,

114
00:06:25,686 --> 00:06:27,813
<i>Mr. Nottingham has
developed a fear, uh...</i>

115
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:29,253
Not a fear, an awareness...

116
00:06:29,323 --> 00:06:31,917
...of germs and how
dangerous they can be

117
00:06:31,993 --> 00:06:35,326
when not properly... feared, so...

118
00:06:35,396 --> 00:06:37,796
You're doing the right
thing. I didn't shower today.

119
00:06:37,865 --> 00:06:39,628
So, yeah, let me get out of here.

120
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:42,362
<i>Barry Nottingham, everybody.</i>

121
00:06:44,605 --> 00:06:47,972
<i>- He's brilliant, him. I love this guy.
- Welcome.</i>

122
00:06:48,042 --> 00:06:53,002
As you know, I own 23 hotels
from Berlin to Beijing.

123
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,139
But it's no secret that this one,

124
00:06:55,216 --> 00:06:58,413
<i>the Sunny Vista
Nottingham, is my favorite.</i>

125
00:07:01,689 --> 00:07:05,420
<i>However, this is a 20th-century hotel.</i>

126
00:07:05,493 --> 00:07:08,690
We need something for the 21 st century.

127
00:07:08,763 --> 00:07:12,164
<i>And so, we have decided
to close this hotel</i>

128
00:07:12,233 --> 00:07:17,261
and to build a brand-new
Sunny Vista Mega Nottingham.

129
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:23,408
This will be the largest
hotel on the West Coast.

130
00:07:23,477 --> 00:07:27,072
I simply don't understand what the
fuss is about. It's just a big building.

131
00:07:27,148 --> 00:07:29,912
Oh, no, no. This is like the
future of the hotel business.

132
00:07:29,984 --> 00:07:33,647
...and a top-secret theme
that will blow your mind.

133
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:37,252
Yes!

134
00:07:37,324 --> 00:07:42,227
So I'm proud to announce the
new hotel's general manager.

135
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:45,356
He's been waiting on
this for a long time.

136
00:07:45,433 --> 00:07:49,563
We all know how hard he
works, how intelligent he is,

137
00:07:49,637 --> 00:07:52,071
how much this hotel means to him.

138
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:55,233
Take a bow, Mr. Kendall Duncan!

139
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:57,576
Take a bow, Kendall.

140
00:07:58,679 --> 00:08:00,874
- God bless.
- Boo!

141
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:05,112
A beautiful speech,
sir. A beautiful speech.

142
00:08:05,186 --> 00:08:07,177
I'm so glad you could come.

143
00:08:07,254 --> 00:08:09,051
It's great to see you.

144
00:08:09,123 --> 00:08:10,556
Don't touch me.

145
00:08:10,624 --> 00:08:11,955
Well done, Daddy.

146
00:08:14,328 --> 00:08:17,263
Oh, oh, hello there. Do you
know my daughter, Violet?

147
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:19,265
Only by reputation, sir.

148
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:21,028
Excuse me?

149
00:08:21,102 --> 00:08:23,900
No, no, not that she has a reputation.

150
00:08:23,971 --> 00:08:25,438
<i>I always heard she's very hot.</i>

151
00:08:26,307 --> 00:08:28,070
Not hot as in hot.

152
00:08:28,142 --> 00:08:30,110
Hot, I meant warm... Warm-hearted.

153
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:34,079
<i>And she likes to go out
and have fun, festive times,</i>

154
00:08:34,148 --> 00:08:37,379
in bars, with a lot of
different guys, and...

155
00:08:37,451 --> 00:08:40,420
That's the old Violet
Nottingham. Before she met me.

156
00:08:40,488 --> 00:08:43,218
Now it's up to me to keep my
pooky-bear out of the spotlight

157
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:46,885
and nightclubs and tabloids.
Isn't that right, sir?

158
00:08:46,961 --> 00:08:49,896
<i>Violet's off to her private
tennis lesson with Roger Federer.</i>

159
00:08:49,964 --> 00:08:52,626
- Oh. All right, good for you.
- Bye, boys.

160
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,362
Got to say, uh...

161
00:08:55,436 --> 00:08:58,997
<i>...it's gonna be hard for me to see
the hotel move locations like this.</i>

162
00:08:59,073 --> 00:09:02,509
Well, I, I do hope you'll feel
able to come and work with us there.

163
00:09:02,576 --> 00:09:04,601
Big as Kendall wants to make it,

164
00:09:04,678 --> 00:09:07,442
well, there's going to be a
lot of light bulbs to change.

165
00:09:08,749 --> 00:09:10,910
Someone touched me.
Is there any sanitizer?

166
00:09:10,985 --> 00:09:13,476
There is, sir. Come this
way. I'll get you some.

167
00:09:13,554 --> 00:09:15,317
Can't be too careful, Kendall.

168
00:09:24,832 --> 00:09:27,198
<i>All right, everyone finished
at the pottery table,</i>

169
00:09:27,268 --> 00:09:28,792
bring their art to the kiln.

170
00:09:28,869 --> 00:09:31,463
<i>The man with the rescue
donkey's leaving in five minutes,</i>

171
00:09:31,539 --> 00:09:33,268
<i>if you haven't gotten a ride, hurry up.</i>

172
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,568
<i>Thank you, Principal Duva.</i>

173
00:09:34,642 --> 00:09:37,110
Oh, I'm not a principal
at this party. I'm a mom.

174
00:09:37,978 --> 00:09:39,707
Hey!

175
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:43,045
I notice no one's eating the
gluten-free wheatgrass cake.

176
00:09:43,117 --> 00:09:46,575
Come on. Trust me, you just
got to get past the smell.

177
00:09:50,558 --> 00:09:52,890
What? The clown died?

178
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,656
- What's in that bag?
- Oh, chocolate chip cookie.

179
00:09:55,729 --> 00:09:58,857
- Food!
- Food!

180
00:09:58,933 --> 00:10:01,800
- Slow it down, slow it down.
- Hey, sissy.

181
00:10:01,869 --> 00:10:05,930
<i>Why do you bring sugary, chemical-filled
crud to my house every time you visit?</i>

182
00:10:06,006 --> 00:10:09,032
<i>What? Every time? You haven't
invited me here in four years.</i>

183
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:11,543
What are you talking about?
It hasn't been four years.

184
00:10:11,612 --> 00:10:13,705
You were here for The
Fourth of July barbecue

185
00:10:13,781 --> 00:10:15,078
when you punched my husband?

186
00:10:15,149 --> 00:10:17,913
<i>Yes. That was four years ago.
I wanted to give him a wedgie,</i>

187
00:10:17,985 --> 00:10:19,714
but his underwear had holes in it.

188
00:10:19,787 --> 00:10:22,585
I knew he'd be your
ex-husband. You should be happy.

189
00:10:22,656 --> 00:10:24,021
All right. Let's not start.

190
00:10:24,091 --> 00:10:25,683
How are the kids handling

191
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:27,192
<i>the old divorce anyways?</i>

192
00:10:27,261 --> 00:10:30,321
They're both kind of off right
now. Bobbi's been really quiet.

193
00:10:30,397 --> 00:10:32,888
Why don't you go say hi.
I'm gonna pay the donkey guy.

194
00:10:32,967 --> 00:10:35,527
- Is that what stinks in here?
- No, it's the cake.

195
00:10:35,603 --> 00:10:37,366
What did she make, donkey cake?

196
00:10:37,438 --> 00:10:40,532
I smell manure.

197
00:10:40,608 --> 00:10:43,304
Hey, you guys. Remember me?

198
00:10:44,445 --> 00:10:45,776
Uncle Skeeter.

199
00:10:45,846 --> 00:10:49,282
<i>Man, you got big. Haven't
seen you in a while.</i>

200
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:52,012
Happy birthday there, Bobbi.

201
00:10:52,086 --> 00:10:54,554
I'm Patrick. She's Bobbi.

202
00:10:54,622 --> 00:10:56,283
Oh, my bad.

203
00:10:56,357 --> 00:10:59,451
Got you a little something.
Happy birthday, Bobbi.

204
00:10:59,526 --> 00:11:02,086
Here you go. Picked it up at the hotel.

205
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:04,289
How's school going?

206
00:11:04,365 --> 00:11:06,697
- Skeeter?
- Yeah.

207
00:11:06,767 --> 00:11:09,292
Getting called to the
principal's office. Look at that.

208
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:11,429
<i>Have fun with the gifts. And...</i>

209
00:11:12,373 --> 00:11:13,863
Yes, yes.

210
00:11:14,575 --> 00:11:16,202
Shampoo?

211
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:19,001
And a soap?

212
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:22,078
Hanger and a towel.

213
00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:24,174
Do not talk about school with them.

214
00:11:24,251 --> 00:11:26,549
What's going on with the school?

215
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,645
- They're closing it down.
- No.

216
00:11:28,722 --> 00:11:31,350
- I'm getting laid off.
- You?

217
00:11:31,425 --> 00:11:33,893
You're like the classic
school principal.

218
00:11:33,961 --> 00:11:36,589
I mean, you're, you're
scary and bad with people.

219
00:11:36,664 --> 00:11:38,256
Children are nervous around you.

220
00:11:38,332 --> 00:11:41,733
That doesn't sound right, but, I'm
just saying, what else could you do?

221
00:11:41,802 --> 00:11:45,602
Maybe, Cuban dictator? Or the
bogeyman. You could be the bogeyman.

222
00:11:45,673 --> 00:11:47,334
- Anyway...
- What, what?

223
00:11:47,408 --> 00:11:49,433
<i>I've got some interviews
set up in Arizona,</i>

224
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:52,035
which is kind of what I
wanted to talk to you about.

225
00:11:52,112 --> 00:11:53,579
Uh-oh.

226
00:11:53,647 --> 00:11:56,241
I need you to watch
the kids... for a week.

227
00:11:56,317 --> 00:11:59,252
<i>No! No, they don't even like me!</i>

228
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,151
It's not going to be difficult, Skeeter.

229
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:03,121
My friend Jill is a
teacher at my school.

230
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:06,421
She'll bring the kids in with her
and watch them till dinnertime.

231
00:12:06,493 --> 00:12:08,120
All you gotta do is the night shift.

232
00:12:08,195 --> 00:12:09,856
Why can't your stupid friend do that?

233
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:12,660
She's got night school. Skeeter!

234
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:15,224
My husband left me.
I'm getting laid off.

235
00:12:15,302 --> 00:12:18,362
<i>I, I have to move. I need your help.</i>

236
00:12:18,439 --> 00:12:21,033
So you need me. This is good.

237
00:12:21,108 --> 00:12:22,405
I'll do it.

238
00:12:22,476 --> 00:12:24,171
But you got to say,

239
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:26,212
"Skeeter is the coolest. I am a nerd."

240
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,145
"Skeeter's the coolest. I'm a nerd?"

241
00:12:28,215 --> 00:12:31,378
Yeah, you are! Whoo!

242
00:12:31,452 --> 00:12:32,749
OK. Hey, you guys.

243
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:35,084
I'm going to hang out with
you this week. All right?

244
00:12:35,155 --> 00:12:36,952
Maybe we can go... fishing.

245
00:12:37,024 --> 00:12:39,891
I'd rather you didn't.
Patrick's not a strong swimmer.

246
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,291
OK, we'll stay inside.

247
00:12:41,362 --> 00:12:43,387
How about, uh, we play some poker?

248
00:12:43,464 --> 00:12:46,627
- I can teach you that.
- Gambling? I don't think so.

249
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:49,225
OK, how about we just
take walks in the park

250
00:12:49,303 --> 00:12:52,397
- and catalog plant species?
- Now you're talking.

251
00:12:52,473 --> 00:12:54,134
I don't know anything about plants

252
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:56,142
except you try to
make cakes out of them!

253
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:58,337
He liked that one. I'm
gonna end with a laugh.

254
00:12:58,412 --> 00:13:01,575
<i>Give me some. Huh?</i>

255
00:13:01,648 --> 00:13:04,549
I wasn't gonna hit you. I was
trying to do the fist thing.

256
00:13:04,618 --> 00:13:06,347
You don't know the fist thing?

257
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:07,887
OK, I was just...

258
00:13:08,856 --> 00:13:11,347
That's what, uh, the children do.

259
00:13:12,059 --> 00:13:13,424
Hey, yeh, yeh.

260
00:13:16,764 --> 00:13:18,231
Oh, this your truck, chief?

261
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:19,993
Yes, it is, ma'am.

262
00:13:20,067 --> 00:13:22,558
You realize you're taking
up two parking spaces?

263
00:13:22,636 --> 00:13:24,331
It's a big truck, ma'am.

264
00:13:24,405 --> 00:13:27,101
It's not that big, sir.
You could fit into one spot.

265
00:13:27,174 --> 00:13:29,199
I had to park all the
way down the block.

266
00:13:29,276 --> 00:13:32,109
Well, next time park in that
box. Plenty of room in there.

267
00:13:32,179 --> 00:13:36,275
Anyway, here's the situation.
This is not really my truck,

268
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:38,443
this is the hotel I work for's truck.

269
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:41,579
So if I get a scratch on it,
they take it out of my salary.

270
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:44,522
<i>So two parking spaces
provides me with what I call</i>

271
00:13:44,591 --> 00:13:48,027
"a cushion of protection."

272
00:13:48,095 --> 00:13:51,087
Wait, a hotel? Oh, wait.
You're Wendy's brother.

273
00:13:51,165 --> 00:13:53,133
- Yeah.
- I'm Jill.

274
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,532
- Who's that?
- I'm her friend,

275
00:13:55,602 --> 00:13:58,400
the one helping take care of
the kids. I'm the day shift.

276
00:13:58,472 --> 00:14:03,205
OK, June. You plan on being
this hostile the whole time?

277
00:14:03,277 --> 00:14:05,074
Jill. My name is Jill.

278
00:14:05,145 --> 00:14:07,739
Do you plan on keeping that
haircut the rest of the time?

279
00:14:07,815 --> 00:14:11,512
<i>Oh, haven't you heard?
Goofy's the new handsome.</i>

280
00:14:16,089 --> 00:14:19,786
<i>- That sounds good for the environment.
- Oh, we can't all have Priuses.</i>

281
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:22,260
<i>How do you know I drive a Prius?</i>

282
00:14:22,329 --> 00:14:25,264
Your whole aura reads Prius.

283
00:14:27,935 --> 00:14:30,426
Anyways, you're in my cushion
of protection right now.

284
00:14:30,504 --> 00:14:33,530
I want to back up, so if you
could just zing-zang up there,

285
00:14:33,607 --> 00:14:36,474
- that would be helpful.
- Yeah.

286
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,738
You might want some
Cinnabons. You'll need it.

287
00:14:38,812 --> 00:14:41,906
Food!

288
00:14:41,982 --> 00:14:46,282
<i>Give it back! Somebody
owes me six bucks!</i>

289
00:14:46,353 --> 00:14:51,052
So why didn't you demand that he make
you the big boss of the new hotel?

290
00:14:51,124 --> 00:14:52,421
He promised your dad.

291
00:14:52,493 --> 00:14:54,859
I wanted to. It just
wasn't the right time.

292
00:14:54,928 --> 00:14:56,293
Let me tell you how it works.

293
00:14:56,363 --> 00:14:58,126
<i>The big man's giving the job to Kendall</i>

294
00:14:58,198 --> 00:14:59,756
because he's dating his daughter.

295
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:01,994
That's the way it works,
keep it in the family.

296
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:04,833
<i>He gets the girl, he gets
the job, he gets everything.</i>

297
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:06,167
And I get nothing.

298
00:15:12,446 --> 00:15:14,607
<i>- Hello?
- Where are you? Still there?</i>

299
00:15:14,681 --> 00:15:16,342
I'm still where? Who's this?

300
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:19,442
<i>Look, I've got to get to class.
The kids are waiting for you, OK?</i>

301
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,613
Oh! Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm sorry.

302
00:15:21,688 --> 00:15:24,452
I forgot. I'll be there
in like 20 minutes.

303
00:15:25,692 --> 00:15:28,752
I'm gonna baby-sit my
nephew and niece tonight.

304
00:15:28,829 --> 00:15:32,458
<i>Oh, God. Got any advice for me?</i>

305
00:15:32,533 --> 00:15:35,127
Yes, I do. Sometimes I
baby-sit my cousins, right?

306
00:15:35,202 --> 00:15:37,432
And what I do is I
let them style me hair.

307
00:15:37,504 --> 00:15:40,735
Like put beads into it and braid
it, make me look all real sexy.

308
00:15:40,807 --> 00:15:44,004
Like Milli Vanilli, stuff
like that. You should try that.

309
00:15:44,077 --> 00:15:46,978
<i>Braid my hair? That's a good
idea. Can I have some French fries?</i>

310
00:15:47,047 --> 00:15:49,675
Of course you can.
You're my best friend.

311
00:15:51,485 --> 00:15:54,045
Ah! Actually, I really
like ketchup on my face

312
00:15:54,121 --> 00:15:56,055
<i>because it's rejuvenating for the skin.</i>

313
00:15:56,123 --> 00:15:58,614
<i>So who's the real victim? You are.</i>

314
00:15:58,692 --> 00:16:01,354
Mmm! Delicious.

315
00:16:05,532 --> 00:16:07,329
Do you think these signs will help?

316
00:16:07,401 --> 00:16:09,801
Well, miracles happen, you know?

317
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:12,031
You mean like Dad coming back?

318
00:16:12,105 --> 00:16:13,436
Um...

319
00:16:16,944 --> 00:16:20,539
Hey! Sorry I'm late.

320
00:16:20,614 --> 00:16:22,548
So, um, their pajamas are on their beds,

321
00:16:22,616 --> 00:16:26,177
and I will be back, um, at
8:30 to pick them up, OK?

322
00:16:26,253 --> 00:16:29,017
- All right.
- Here is my cell phone number.

323
00:16:29,089 --> 00:16:31,614
And call me if there's any emergencies.

324
00:16:31,692 --> 00:16:34,490
<i>All right. Have fun at night school.</i>

325
00:16:34,561 --> 00:16:36,586
- Bye, guys.
- Bye.

326
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:38,824
All packed up here.

327
00:16:38,899 --> 00:16:42,266
I got my, uh, toothbrush
and, uh, and the toothpaste.

328
00:16:44,338 --> 00:16:45,737
Some clean underwear.

329
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,908
Well, maybe not that clean.

330
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:52,402
You guys want to watch TV?

331
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:54,379
<i>We don't have a TV.</i>

332
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:57,707
<i>- Hello?
- Emergency!</i>

333
00:16:59,586 --> 00:17:00,985
<i>They don't have a TV.</i>

334
00:17:01,054 --> 00:17:03,488
Wendy doesn't let them
watch TV. You didn't know?

335
00:17:03,557 --> 00:17:05,548
I don't know a lot of
things about these kids.

336
00:17:05,626 --> 00:17:08,322
<i>I wasn't allowed over here.
Their old man didn't like me.</i>

337
00:17:08,395 --> 00:17:11,489
OK, listen, you don't need a TV. You
can, um, play a game, do a puzzle.

338
00:17:11,565 --> 00:17:13,829
I'm sure you can figure
something out. OK?

339
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,733
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Should I let
them braid my hair or something?

340
00:17:16,803 --> 00:17:18,361
Would they like that?

341
00:17:18,438 --> 00:17:20,702
I don't think anyone
should touch that hair.

342
00:17:23,777 --> 00:17:27,941
Hey, what do you say we go...

343
00:17:28,015 --> 00:17:31,451
next door and toilet paper
your neighbor's trees?

344
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:35,419
No? OK, bedtime!

345
00:17:46,299 --> 00:17:48,199
OK, so you guys cool?

346
00:17:48,268 --> 00:17:50,759
<i>You have to read us a bedtime story.</i>

347
00:17:50,837 --> 00:17:53,203
<i>Yeah, all right. You have any?</i>

348
00:17:54,508 --> 00:17:59,002
Whoo! What do you got here, anyways?

349
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:02,139
<i>"Rainbow Alligator Saves the Wetlands"?</i>

350
00:18:02,215 --> 00:18:04,376
Mmm, no.

351
00:18:04,451 --> 00:18:07,818
<i>"The Organic Squirrel
Gets a Bike Helmet"?</i>

352
00:18:07,888 --> 00:18:10,413
I'm not reading these
communist books to you guys.

353
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:12,014
Don't you got any real stories?

354
00:18:12,092 --> 00:18:14,390
- Like what?
- Like what?

355
00:18:14,461 --> 00:18:16,895
Like, like cowboys? Or dragons?

356
00:18:16,963 --> 00:18:20,194
Or aliens? Or... What the
heck is on my head right now?

357
00:18:20,267 --> 00:18:23,395
That's Bugsy, our guinea pig.

358
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:26,405
- Why do you call him Bugsy?
- Because of his eyes.

359
00:18:26,473 --> 00:18:28,202
Let me see them.

360
00:18:30,377 --> 00:18:35,076
Wow! Those eyes would be big on a cow.

361
00:18:37,084 --> 00:18:39,382
Are those eyeballs or bowling balls?

362
00:18:39,453 --> 00:18:41,421
Can't keep my eyes off of them.

363
00:18:41,488 --> 00:18:45,083
<i>Just get in there so I don't have
to look at them anymore. Goodbye.</i>

364
00:18:45,158 --> 00:18:46,785
Anyways, uh,

365
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:49,624
you guys want me to, uh,
make up a story for you?

366
00:18:49,696 --> 00:18:51,630
Like, like my old man used to do for me?

367
00:18:51,698 --> 00:18:53,222
Maybe I could be good at this.

368
00:18:55,102 --> 00:18:57,730
All right, um...

369
00:18:57,804 --> 00:18:58,998
Here goes.

370
00:18:59,072 --> 00:19:04,271
Once upon a time, in a
magical, faraway kingdom...

371
00:19:05,746 --> 00:19:09,045
<i>... there was a brave and noble knight.</i>

372
00:19:09,116 --> 00:19:12,051
<i>Strikingly handsome.</i>

373
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:13,916
<i>Who lived in a grand castle</i>

374
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:19,516
<i>that weary travelers from near
and far would come and visit.</i>

375
00:19:19,593 --> 00:19:23,586
<i>Now, this knight had been
working his butt off for years.</i>

376
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:26,461
<i>You'd think he'd be a shoo-in
to rule the castle, right?</i>

377
00:19:26,533 --> 00:19:28,626
<i>- Right.
- Wrong.</i>

378
00:19:28,702 --> 00:19:33,696
<i>Actually, he wasn't
even a knight at all.</i>

379
00:19:35,108 --> 00:19:36,973
Oh, no.

380
00:19:38,745 --> 00:19:42,306
<i>He was, in fact, just a lowly peasant.</i>

381
00:19:42,382 --> 00:19:45,613
<i>And even though he was the son
of the late, great Lord Marty...</i>

382
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:47,380
Thank you.

383
00:19:47,454 --> 00:19:51,515
<i>... and knew everything there is
to know about running a castle,</i>

384
00:19:51,591 --> 00:19:54,560
<i>everyone just took him for granted.</i>

385
00:19:54,628 --> 00:19:58,655
<i>His name was Mr. Underappreciated.</i>

386
00:19:58,732 --> 00:20:00,666
What's "underdemeciated"?

387
00:20:00,734 --> 00:20:03,498
- Under de-what?
- Underdemeciated.

388
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:05,800
That's right, I forgot you were six.

389
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:09,171
His name was
Sir... Fix-A-Lot.

390
00:20:09,242 --> 00:20:12,211
<i>But alas, the kingdom
where Sir Fix-A-Lot lived</i>

391
00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:16,443
<i>did not place much value on
dedication or hard work, I guess.</i>

392
00:20:16,516 --> 00:20:22,045
<i>Because the superstar in all
the land was Sir Butt-Kiss.</i>

393
00:20:22,122 --> 00:20:25,990
<i>And he spent all his days
kissing everybody's butt.</i>

394
00:20:27,894 --> 00:20:29,691
Boo!

395
00:20:29,763 --> 00:20:32,254
And my lord, yes, of
course I can get you

396
00:20:32,332 --> 00:20:35,529
<i>front row house seats to The Lion King.</i>

397
00:20:35,602 --> 00:20:38,435
And Sir Fix-A-Lot had a
best friend, Friar Fred,

398
00:20:38,505 --> 00:20:40,439
who was not right in the head.

399
00:20:40,507 --> 00:20:44,876
<i>She never! No! Not our
queen, I won't have that.</i>

400
00:20:44,945 --> 00:20:48,676
- Were there any kids in the kingdom?
- Yes, yes. Of course.

401
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:51,715
<i>There were two young pages.</i>

402
00:20:51,785 --> 00:20:55,346
Mistress Stinky and Master Smelly.

403
00:20:55,422 --> 00:20:58,289
Hey-oh! And don't forget...

404
00:20:58,358 --> 00:21:00,792
Jillian! The queen of the fairies!

405
00:21:00,861 --> 00:21:02,590
<i>Queen of the fairies?</i>

406
00:21:02,662 --> 00:21:05,961
<i>I mean, if she has to be there,
let's just make her an angry raven.</i>

407
00:21:09,236 --> 00:21:11,670
Parking spot!

408
00:21:11,738 --> 00:21:14,002
<i>She should be a mermaid teacher.</i>

409
00:21:14,074 --> 00:21:16,634
<i>Yeah. The best mermaid
teacher in the world.</i>

410
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:19,338
Children, open your books to page 16.

411
00:21:19,412 --> 00:21:20,845
Yes, Miss Mermaid.

412
00:21:20,914 --> 00:21:22,176
Let's begin.

413
00:21:22,249 --> 00:21:24,513
<i>All right, she's a
mermaid. Whatever you want.</i>

414
00:21:24,584 --> 00:21:26,051
Anyways, back to the story.

415
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:30,283
<i>One day the king invited all
his subjects to the castle.</i>

416
00:21:30,357 --> 00:21:32,188
I bring glad tidings.

417
00:21:32,259 --> 00:21:34,819
<i>For on this day I have chosen a champion</i>

418
00:21:34,895 --> 00:21:36,954
who will run this castle

419
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:41,433
<i>and be my closest
advisor and bestest buddy.</i>

420
00:21:41,501 --> 00:21:44,231
My new champion is...

421
00:21:44,304 --> 00:21:45,669
...Sir Butt-Kiss!

422
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:57,214
Thank you.

423
00:21:57,284 --> 00:22:01,618
<i>Poor Sir Fix-A-Lot
had been passed over.</i>

424
00:22:01,688 --> 00:22:05,988
<i>So, Sir Fix-A-Lot
moved into a giant shoe,</i>

425
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:09,586
<i>got a bad case of athlete's face,</i>

426
00:22:09,663 --> 00:22:10,857
<i>dove into a moat...</i>

427
00:22:10,931 --> 00:22:12,899
Ah, what the heck.

428
00:22:12,966 --> 00:22:14,695
<i>... and got eaten by crocodiles.</i>

429
00:22:16,603 --> 00:22:18,036
The end.

430
00:22:18,104 --> 00:22:21,369
The end? That can't be the end.

431
00:22:21,441 --> 00:22:23,705
- Why? Why not?
- It's not happy.

432
00:22:23,777 --> 00:22:27,304
There aren't happy endings in real
life. Sooner you know that, the better.

433
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:30,110
- It's not fair!
- What? What's not fair?

434
00:22:30,183 --> 00:22:34,244
I mean, shouldn't Sir Fix-A-Lot
at least get a shot to be champion?

435
00:22:34,321 --> 00:22:37,722
- A shot? Hmm...
- If Sir Fix-A-Lot is better

436
00:22:37,791 --> 00:22:40,760
<i>than Sir Butt-Kiss, he should
get a chance to prove it.</i>

437
00:22:40,827 --> 00:22:43,261
OK. Yeah, yeah, Bobbi, good.

438
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:45,127
What the king really said was...

439
00:22:45,198 --> 00:22:47,632
On second thought,

440
00:22:47,701 --> 00:22:50,761
there is another worthy
man in my kingdom,

441
00:22:50,837 --> 00:22:54,329
and it wouldn't be fair
unless he got a shot, too.

442
00:22:54,407 --> 00:22:57,308
Sir
Fix-A-Lot!

443
00:22:57,377 --> 00:22:59,436
<i>And then the crowd went nuts.</i>

444
00:23:01,848 --> 00:23:06,342
But, Sire, Fix-A-Lot
is as common as muck.

445
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:07,613
Boo!

446
00:23:07,687 --> 00:23:10,656
<i>And Friar Fred drop-kicked
a booing goblin.</i>

447
00:23:10,724 --> 00:23:13,591
Boo!

448
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:17,721
<i>And the mermaid teacher did one
of those weird tail dolphin moves.</i>

449
00:23:20,467 --> 00:23:23,027
<i>And Stinky and Smelly did
the fastest Irish jig ever.</i>

450
00:23:23,103 --> 00:23:26,163
<i>Whoo-hoo-hoo!</i>

451
00:23:26,239 --> 00:23:28,867
Yeah. Right on.

452
00:23:28,942 --> 00:23:32,207
<i>Prince Bugsy busted
out some fancy moves.</i>

453
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:35,213
And then... and then...

454
00:23:35,281 --> 00:23:37,272
It started raining gumballs.

455
00:23:40,787 --> 00:23:42,516
Raining gumballs?

456
00:23:42,589 --> 00:23:45,717
Why not? It's a bedtime
story. Anything can happen.

457
00:23:45,792 --> 00:23:48,818
Yeah, yeah. I guess in a story.

458
00:23:48,895 --> 00:23:52,194
I just wish it was like that
in real life. I really do.

459
00:23:53,566 --> 00:23:56,558
- What was that?
- Bugsy.

460
00:23:56,636 --> 00:23:58,627
Oh.

461
00:23:58,705 --> 00:24:00,366
He rings that bell when he's hungry?

462
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:03,739
No, when he needs to go to sleep.

463
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:12,941
OK. As you wish, Your Highness.

464
00:24:16,723 --> 00:24:20,853
<i>All right, you guys, have a good
sleep. You, too, uh, weird eyes.</i>

465
00:24:28,068 --> 00:24:31,231
<i>Well, I don't have much to work with,</i>

466
00:24:31,304 --> 00:24:33,431
but I will make us

467
00:24:33,506 --> 00:24:36,703
a delicious breakfast

468
00:24:36,776 --> 00:24:39,370
that I know you will enjoy.

469
00:24:39,446 --> 00:24:42,472
Yes, some banana on the rice cake,

470
00:24:42,549 --> 00:24:45,109
and then what do we
call this? Wheat germ.

471
00:24:45,185 --> 00:24:47,881
I was told germs are bad
for you, but here goes.

472
00:24:49,289 --> 00:24:51,120
I like it.

473
00:24:51,191 --> 00:24:53,785
A rice cake-banana-wheat
germ sandwich.

474
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:55,384
And what do we got?

475
00:25:01,034 --> 00:25:02,626
This is terrible.

476
00:25:02,702 --> 00:25:05,102
<i>Doesn't your, your
mother have taste buds?</i>

477
00:25:05,171 --> 00:25:07,935
What are we doing here? We got
nothing to use in this house.

478
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:09,599
Hang on.

479
00:25:11,277 --> 00:25:13,040
<i>A little flavor.</i>

480
00:25:14,948 --> 00:25:18,076
<i>It's good because, now we
don't have to brush our teeth.</i>

481
00:25:20,286 --> 00:25:23,744
There you go. At least we got a
little mint going on. Guys want one?

482
00:25:24,858 --> 00:25:26,826
<i>Hang on.</i>

483
00:25:29,362 --> 00:25:32,229
<i>Hello!</i>

484
00:25:32,298 --> 00:25:34,926
<i>Bronson? The television
set in Mr. Nottingham's room</i>

485
00:25:35,001 --> 00:25:37,128
is broken and it needs
to be fixed right away.

486
00:25:37,203 --> 00:25:40,297
<i>I have a situation here. I'm
watching my nephew and my niece.</i>

487
00:25:40,373 --> 00:25:42,807
<i>I'm sorry. Are you having
difficulty hearing me?</i>

488
00:25:42,876 --> 00:25:45,401
<i>Mr. Nottingham wants
to watch television now!</i>

489
00:25:45,478 --> 00:25:47,912
I hear you. I speak
trollinese, don't worry.

490
00:25:47,981 --> 00:25:50,916
<i>There's a leprechaun behind you.</i>

491
00:25:50,984 --> 00:25:52,713
Gotcha.

492
00:25:55,855 --> 00:25:58,153
Thanks a lot, gentlemen. OK.

493
00:25:58,224 --> 00:25:59,589
- Wow.
- It's pretty, huh?

494
00:25:59,659 --> 00:26:00,648
Whoa!

495
00:26:00,727 --> 00:26:04,686
<i>I got to go fix my boss' television set,
but I need somebody to watch you two.</i>

496
00:26:04,764 --> 00:26:07,494
<i>Violet! Right here. Give a smile.</i>

497
00:26:07,567 --> 00:26:08,932
Hang on.

498
00:26:09,002 --> 00:26:12,631
Violet! Skeeter Bronson, the
handyman from the other day.

499
00:26:12,705 --> 00:26:14,434
Oh, right. Yes.

500
00:26:14,507 --> 00:26:16,805
Listen, uh, I got some
kids with me right now.

501
00:26:16,876 --> 00:26:19,367
My nephew and niece. But, I
gotta fix your father's TV.

502
00:26:19,445 --> 00:26:21,106
Could you watch them a few minutes?

503
00:26:21,181 --> 00:26:22,546
Huh?

504
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:26,348
Yeah, yeah. All right, I'm going.

505
00:26:26,419 --> 00:26:29,217
Come in.

506
00:26:31,157 --> 00:26:34,684
- Mr. Nottingham, sir?
- Uh, the telly won't turn on.

507
00:26:34,761 --> 00:26:38,322
It won't? Well, let me just
take a... tallyho at it, OK?

508
00:26:38,398 --> 00:26:40,161
I'll just flip this light on.

509
00:26:40,233 --> 00:26:43,828
No, no, no, no! Absolutely not!

510
00:26:43,903 --> 00:26:45,370
I'm fighting a cold here.

511
00:26:45,438 --> 00:26:47,770
<i>I must stay in the
dark whenever possible.</i>

512
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,330
Do you realize

513
00:26:49,409 --> 00:26:53,311
germs can reproduce 80
percent faster in bright light?

514
00:26:53,379 --> 00:26:56,212
Oh, OK. Here we go, nice and dark again.

515
00:26:56,282 --> 00:26:58,648
- The germs are confused.
- Come towards me.

516
00:26:58,718 --> 00:27:01,516
OK. It's got to be
around here somewhere.

517
00:27:04,023 --> 00:27:05,388
<i>For heaven's sake.</i>

518
00:27:05,458 --> 00:27:07,892
I'm so sorry, sir. I
just can't see a thing.

519
00:27:07,961 --> 00:27:10,156
- To your left, there.
- Oh!

520
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:13,722
There's the TV. So how's the,
uh, new hotel coming, sir?

521
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:17,827
<i>Oh, very well. Still dealing with the
city on building permits and whatnot.</i>

522
00:27:17,904 --> 00:27:19,371
Uh-huh.

523
00:27:19,439 --> 00:27:21,168
I can't tell you the secret theme.

524
00:27:21,241 --> 00:27:23,607
It's so good, we don't
want anyone to steal it.

525
00:27:23,676 --> 00:27:26,611
- I hear you, sir.
- OK, I'll tell you.

526
00:27:26,679 --> 00:27:28,704
Come along, sit down. Please.

527
00:27:28,781 --> 00:27:30,112
Great.

528
00:27:30,984 --> 00:27:32,747
Ready?

529
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:36,645
Rock and roll.

530
00:27:36,723 --> 00:27:39,715
<i>Vintage vinyl. Music
memorabilia in the lobby.</i>

531
00:27:39,792 --> 00:27:43,023
Oh, OK. Like, uh, like the Hard Rock?

532
00:27:43,096 --> 00:27:45,860
- The What What?
- The Hard Rock Hotel.

533
00:27:45,932 --> 00:27:48,924
<i>They've been using that
theme for, like, years.</i>

534
00:27:50,136 --> 00:27:54,937
Get Kendall Duncan up
here straightaway, please.

535
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:57,238
What a perfect little powder puff.

536
00:28:01,214 --> 00:28:02,238
Thank you.

537
00:28:02,315 --> 00:28:05,807
So, Patrick, truth or dare?

538
00:28:05,885 --> 00:28:08,115
Truth?

539
00:28:08,187 --> 00:28:11,315
How old were you the first
time you kissed a girl?

540
00:28:11,391 --> 00:28:13,450
<i>Patrick never kissed a girl.</i>

541
00:28:13,526 --> 00:28:15,494
Girls are bis-crusting.

542
00:28:16,362 --> 00:28:19,229
Except for Trisha Sparks.

543
00:28:19,299 --> 00:28:22,132
Ooh, is that a girl in your
class, you little Romeo?

544
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:23,327
Hey, guys.

545
00:28:23,403 --> 00:28:25,769
Hi, Aunt Jill, did you
get the note we left you?

546
00:28:25,838 --> 00:28:27,669
Yes, I did.

547
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:30,641
<i>And, uh, now we have to get you
guys ready for school. So, come on.</i>

548
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:32,678
- Hi.
- Hi.

549
00:28:33,846 --> 00:28:35,814
Oh, hey. You're, uh...

550
00:28:35,882 --> 00:28:40,342
- Uh-huh. Here's your fat mouse.
- It's a guinea pig, but...

551
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:43,548
And you, young man...

552
00:28:43,623 --> 00:28:48,390
I want to hear all about this little
Trisha Sparks next time I see you.

553
00:28:51,764 --> 00:28:53,789
Trisha Sparks is two
years older than you.

554
00:28:53,866 --> 00:28:56,232
She's hot.

555
00:28:58,271 --> 00:29:03,368
<i>I'm very disappointed in you, Kendall.
We almost made an apocalyptic mistake.</i>

556
00:29:03,443 --> 00:29:08,710
This rock and roll idea
of yours is old hat.

557
00:29:08,781 --> 00:29:13,343
<i>Well, sir, I had every intention
of putting our own spin on it.</i>

558
00:29:13,419 --> 00:29:14,716
Do you know what, Skeeter?

559
00:29:14,787 --> 00:29:17,415
I'm starting to get a fuzzy recollection

560
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:19,617
of something I said to your father.

561
00:29:19,692 --> 00:29:23,560
<i>In fact, I am going to give you a shot.</i>

562
00:29:25,365 --> 00:29:28,801
If you can come up with a
better theme than Kendall does,

563
00:29:28,868 --> 00:29:31,063
I'll let you run the new place instead.

564
00:29:31,137 --> 00:29:33,401
Oh, sir.

565
00:29:33,473 --> 00:29:36,408
Don't you think this is perhaps
a little too much of a cruel joke

566
00:29:36,476 --> 00:29:39,639
to be playing on somebody as...
well, the, the maintenance guy?

567
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:41,976
- No, I don't.
- No.

568
00:29:42,048 --> 00:29:46,883
Mr. Bronson has been working
for this company for 25 years.

569
00:29:46,953 --> 00:29:51,356
<i>I'm beginning to think I may have
seriously underdemeciated him.</i>

570
00:29:51,424 --> 00:29:53,722
I'm sorry. "Underdemeciated"?

571
00:29:53,793 --> 00:29:59,197
Precisely. You can both present your
ideas at my birthday party this weekend.

572
00:29:59,265 --> 00:30:01,733
Thank you, Kendall. That is all.

573
00:30:01,801 --> 00:30:04,235
<i>Mr. Bronson, the
television, if you would.</i>

574
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:07,238
<i>Oh, and do watch out
for the germ vaporizer.</i>

575
00:30:10,109 --> 00:30:12,339
The best day of my life!

576
00:30:12,412 --> 00:30:14,676
<i>Amadeus Amadeus</i>

577
00:30:14,747 --> 00:30:17,716
<i>Amadeus Ow! Amadeus Yeah, yeah, yeah!</i>

578
00:30:17,784 --> 00:30:20,753
<i>Amadeus Amadeus Amadeus</i>

579
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:23,220
<i>Ooh, rock me Amadeus</i>

580
00:30:23,289 --> 00:30:26,053
<i>Amadeus Amadeus</i>

581
00:30:27,827 --> 00:30:30,125
Whoa. I like your car, pal.

582
00:30:30,196 --> 00:30:32,130
Hey, thanks, champ.
You know what they say.

583
00:30:32,198 --> 00:30:34,530
<i>You want to be the best,
you got to drive the best.</i>

584
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,363
Hey, uh, not to get personal,

585
00:30:36,436 --> 00:30:39,098
but what's a sweet ride
like that cost, anyways?

586
00:30:39,172 --> 00:30:41,868
You know what? Actually
it's surprisingly affordable.

587
00:30:41,941 --> 00:30:42,930
Yeah?

588
00:30:43,009 --> 00:30:46,137
<i>If you saved every paycheck you
earn for the rest of your life</i>

589
00:30:46,212 --> 00:30:49,545
and then multiply it by ten, you
could probably buy my muffler.

590
00:30:51,317 --> 00:30:53,717
Ah-ooga!

591
00:30:53,786 --> 00:30:56,152
Oh, you wanna drag race, do you?

592
00:30:59,892 --> 00:31:02,656
You win! Good job.

593
00:31:23,216 --> 00:31:24,979
What?

594
00:31:53,746 --> 00:31:55,737
This is spooky.

595
00:32:02,889 --> 00:32:06,256
<i>You've got to be kidding me! Look
at this. I'm losing all my candy.</i>

596
00:32:06,325 --> 00:32:10,284
How can you not see a
50-foot trailer? Come on.

597
00:32:14,333 --> 00:32:18,235
<i>So you have to compete for your job with
Skeeter Bronson. You'll annihilate him.</i>

598
00:32:18,304 --> 00:32:21,296
Oh, I know. It's just a
little degrading, that's all.

599
00:32:23,976 --> 00:32:26,342
Thanks for being there.

600
00:32:26,412 --> 00:32:30,712
I'll be there as long as
there's a there to be at.

601
00:32:34,387 --> 00:32:35,684
Oh, hello, children.

602
00:32:35,755 --> 00:32:37,814
We're looking for Skeeter Bronson.

603
00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:40,085
Oh, Mr. Bronson.

604
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:42,354
Yes, you'll find him in room 109.

605
00:32:42,428 --> 00:32:44,521
- OK.
- Please, this way.

606
00:32:54,574 --> 00:32:57,372
- Oh, my God! Did you see that thing?
- Those eyes.

607
00:32:57,443 --> 00:33:00,378
<i>They were, they were staring
into my, my very soul.</i>

608
00:33:01,948 --> 00:33:03,848
- Hey, Uncle Skeeter!
- Hey!

609
00:33:03,916 --> 00:33:07,374
- Just who I wanted to see.
- Hey, chief, here's Bugsy.

610
00:33:07,453 --> 00:33:09,080
<i>- Got him.
- Why do they have to stay here?</i>

611
00:33:09,155 --> 00:33:11,123
Because I'm on call tonight, Jennifer.

612
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:13,454
It's Jill, actually, Scooter.

613
00:33:13,526 --> 00:33:14,857
It is? OK, yeah...

614
00:33:17,396 --> 00:33:18,761
You did not just do that.

615
00:33:18,831 --> 00:33:20,560
I did. Watch. I'm gonna do it again.

616
00:33:22,201 --> 00:33:25,466
So, guys, anything weird
happen to you today?

617
00:33:25,538 --> 00:33:28,735
I had a substitute
teacher with an eye patch.

618
00:33:28,808 --> 00:33:31,834
Uh... that's a little weird.
I'm talking like big-time weird.

619
00:33:31,911 --> 00:33:34,345
Maybe coincidence weird, uh...

620
00:33:34,413 --> 00:33:37,314
...as in gumball weird?

621
00:33:37,383 --> 00:33:39,214
We're not allowed to chew gum.

622
00:33:39,285 --> 00:33:42,652
Of course you're not. You
guys want to go to sleep?

623
00:33:42,722 --> 00:33:44,246
It's only 5:30.

624
00:33:44,323 --> 00:33:45,756
<i>And we haven't had dinner.</i>

625
00:33:45,825 --> 00:33:48,794
Hmm. OK.

626
00:33:48,861 --> 00:33:50,123
Room service!

627
00:33:50,196 --> 00:33:54,064
<i>So you've never been skateboarding?</i>

628
00:33:54,133 --> 00:33:55,657
<i>You've never played video games?</i>

629
00:33:55,735 --> 00:33:57,930
Mom says they rot your brain.

630
00:33:58,004 --> 00:34:02,373
<i>That's not true. I've been playing video
games my whole life, and look at me.</i>

631
00:34:04,677 --> 00:34:07,168
Yeah, maybe she's got a point.

632
00:34:07,246 --> 00:34:09,806
<i>You. You've never eaten bacon?</i>

633
00:34:09,882 --> 00:34:11,782
What's bacon?

634
00:34:11,851 --> 00:34:14,820
Bacon is the juicy,
fatty part of the pig

635
00:34:14,887 --> 00:34:17,082
right adjacent to the rear.

636
00:34:17,156 --> 00:34:22,025
But delicious and tasty,
not how I just made it sound.

637
00:34:22,094 --> 00:34:25,757
<i>And this is the first
hamburger you've ever eaten?</i>

638
00:34:25,831 --> 00:34:29,028
<i>- What's the verdict? What do you think?
- Life-changing.</i>

639
00:34:29,101 --> 00:34:31,467
- Mom's gonna kill us.
- No, she isn't.

640
00:34:31,537 --> 00:34:34,005
<i>First of all, she's never
gonna find out about this.</i>

641
00:34:34,073 --> 00:34:37,270
And second of all, she used
to eat plenty of hamburgers

642
00:34:37,343 --> 00:34:39,436
<i>when we were growing
up in this very room.</i>

643
00:34:39,512 --> 00:34:41,844
She did?

644
00:34:41,914 --> 00:34:45,077
Looks like Bugsy's eaten a lot of
burgers in the last ten minutes.

645
00:34:47,053 --> 00:34:48,042
Wow!

646
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:50,953
He keeps going like that, we
could make bacon out of Bugsy.

647
00:34:52,525 --> 00:34:54,891
He's kidding, Bugsy. Take it easy.

648
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,157
<i>OK. Let's get you carnivores to bed.</i>

649
00:34:58,230 --> 00:35:00,221
I got a, a new story
I want to lay on you.

650
00:35:00,299 --> 00:35:02,164
What do you think of
cowboys and Indians?

651
00:35:02,234 --> 00:35:04,964
Oh, yes, tonight's the night!

652
00:35:05,037 --> 00:35:07,733
I just like cowboys and
Indians 'cause of the conflict.

653
00:35:07,807 --> 00:35:11,274
OK, once upon a time in the Old West,

654
00:35:11,343 --> 00:35:13,834
<i>before room service was even invented...</i>

655
00:35:13,913 --> 00:35:17,371
<i>... there was a farm hand
named Jeremiah Skeets.</i>

656
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:19,509
<i>He was looking to get
ahead in the world,</i>

657
00:35:19,585 --> 00:35:20,847
<i>but was having a problem</i>

658
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:23,013
<i>with his current mode of transportation.</i>

659
00:35:26,492 --> 00:35:29,791
<i>Uh, that was my horse.
That wasn't me, everybody.</i>

660
00:35:31,163 --> 00:35:33,461
<i>Someone once told Jeremiah</i>

661
00:35:33,532 --> 00:35:35,727
<i>that if he wanted to be the best,</i>

662
00:35:35,801 --> 00:35:38,292
<i>he'd have to ride the best.</i>

663
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:40,395
You mind showing me your finest horse?

664
00:35:44,677 --> 00:35:48,773
<i>My ancestors believe horse spirit</i>

665
00:35:48,848 --> 00:35:53,114
come down from mountain
during time of fire, wind.

666
00:35:54,253 --> 00:35:58,815
<i>Many brave warrior walk
trail of moon bear...</i>

667
00:35:58,891 --> 00:36:02,725
OK. Look, I just want to see your
finest horse, not a whole thing there.

668
00:36:02,795 --> 00:36:06,162
- Sorry. I can do it.
- All right.

669
00:36:06,232 --> 00:36:09,099
Screaming Rooster, bring out Ferrari.

670
00:36:09,168 --> 00:36:10,635
Ferrari.

671
00:36:13,472 --> 00:36:15,303
Oh, my.

672
00:36:15,374 --> 00:36:18,104
Oh, my, oh, my!

673
00:36:18,177 --> 00:36:19,439
Look at that.

674
00:36:19,512 --> 00:36:21,605
Whoa!

675
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:25,377
I would get automatic respect
riding such a beautiful animal,

676
00:36:25,451 --> 00:36:28,545
but I'm afraid that's just
a bit out of my price range.

677
00:36:28,621 --> 00:36:31,749
Tell you what, white bread.

678
00:36:31,824 --> 00:36:34,486
<i>I'll give you Ferrari...</i>

679
00:36:35,227 --> 00:36:38,094
...for free!

680
00:36:38,164 --> 00:36:40,792
<i>Boo-yah! The end. I love it.</i>

681
00:36:40,866 --> 00:36:44,632
Brilliant story. So he
got the Ferrari for free.

682
00:36:44,703 --> 00:36:46,261
<i>I love that. I love that.</i>

683
00:36:46,338 --> 00:36:50,672
A guy getting a free horse?
That's not a good story.

684
00:36:52,111 --> 00:36:55,774
<i>Where's the arc? There's no
arc. I've not learned anything.</i>

685
00:36:55,848 --> 00:36:58,248
<i>Also, you've got a
moral obligation to them.</i>

686
00:36:58,317 --> 00:37:00,342
What are they gonna
walk away from that with?

687
00:37:00,419 --> 00:37:03,547
I didn't know we were doing
an After School Special.

688
00:37:03,622 --> 00:37:06,182
Why can't he do something
a real gentleman would do,

689
00:37:06,258 --> 00:37:08,123
<i>like save a damsel in distress?</i>

690
00:37:09,461 --> 00:37:11,827
Not a bad idea, munchkin.

691
00:37:11,897 --> 00:37:15,526
OK. So, uh... let's continue.

692
00:37:15,601 --> 00:37:18,161
<i>Jeremiah was out for a ride when...</i>

693
00:37:19,738 --> 00:37:21,433
Oh, please, don't!

694
00:37:21,507 --> 00:37:25,307
<i>- Give us that jewelry.
- You want my pearls? Help! Please!</i>

695
00:37:25,377 --> 00:37:29,177
Yah! Yah! Yah! Whoo!

696
00:37:30,749 --> 00:37:33,718
Oh, my necklace? Here, take it.

697
00:37:33,786 --> 00:37:35,720
Come on, boy!

698
00:37:35,788 --> 00:37:37,688
Here.

699
00:37:37,756 --> 00:37:39,815
What else you got, sweetie?

700
00:37:39,892 --> 00:37:42,122
Help! Help!

701
00:37:45,431 --> 00:37:47,422
<i>Leave the lady alone!</i>

702
00:37:53,973 --> 00:37:56,032
Care for a lift, ma'am?

703
00:37:56,108 --> 00:37:57,871
- Yeah.
- Oh!

704
00:37:57,943 --> 00:38:02,312
- Nice horse.
- Oh, what, this old thing?

705
00:38:02,381 --> 00:38:05,407
<i>Now, any of you gentlemen want to
give the nice lady her stuff back?</i>

706
00:38:05,484 --> 00:38:07,179
Not a chance, huh?

707
00:38:07,253 --> 00:38:09,744
Because I beg to differ!

708
00:38:09,822 --> 00:38:12,017
- My hero.
- I like that.

709
00:38:13,826 --> 00:38:16,954
<i>So Jeremiah spirited Miss
Davenport away to safety,</i>

710
00:38:17,029 --> 00:38:18,223
<i>when she says...</i>

711
00:38:18,297 --> 00:38:20,663
Shall we go drink champagne
in a nearby hot tub?

712
00:38:23,168 --> 00:38:24,965
- Hot tub?
- Mmm.

713
00:38:25,037 --> 00:38:26,971
Uh, yeah. No.

714
00:38:27,039 --> 00:38:30,634
I was saying that because I wanted to
see if you two were paying attention.

715
00:38:32,945 --> 00:38:36,005
<i>What happened was Jeremiah
dropped Miss Davenport off</i>

716
00:38:36,081 --> 00:38:38,413
<i>in the nearest town, safe and sound.</i>

717
00:38:38,484 --> 00:38:40,213
<i>How ever can I thank you, sir?</i>

718
00:38:40,286 --> 00:38:42,516
Ah, no thanks necessary, ma'am.

719
00:38:42,588 --> 00:38:45,557
But I do insist on expressing
my gratitude in some manner.

720
00:38:46,625 --> 00:38:48,786
Fair enough. I'll take...

721
00:38:48,861 --> 00:38:52,126
...$100 million.

722
00:38:52,197 --> 00:38:54,893
The end. Let's hope it works.

723
00:38:54,967 --> 00:38:57,231
Very well written,
brilliantly constructed.

724
00:38:57,303 --> 00:39:00,534
Jeremiah wouldn't take
money for doing a good deed.

725
00:39:00,606 --> 00:39:03,404
Uh... I know Jeremiah a
lot better than you guys.

726
00:39:03,475 --> 00:39:05,966
<i>And believe me, he'd be all
over that. He loves money.</i>

727
00:39:06,045 --> 00:39:07,342
Mmm!

728
00:39:07,413 --> 00:39:09,881
I don't want that. Go
back, rewrite. Rewrite.

729
00:39:09,949 --> 00:39:11,746
Gentlemen don't get paid.

730
00:39:11,817 --> 00:39:14,251
Will you just... Who's
telling the story here?

731
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,413
It should really end more like this.

732
00:39:16,488 --> 00:39:19,423
<i>Well, I must give you some
token of my appreciation.</i>

733
00:39:19,491 --> 00:39:20,685
Oh, no.

734
00:39:20,759 --> 00:39:22,852
Perhaps... a kiss?

735
00:39:23,796 --> 00:39:24,956
Touchdown.

736
00:39:26,565 --> 00:39:28,760
<i>Then an angry dwarf kicks him.</i>

737
00:39:28,834 --> 00:39:30,301
Ow!

738
00:39:31,403 --> 00:39:33,268
What the heck did you do that for?

739
00:39:33,339 --> 00:39:35,307
Because I'm angry.

740
00:39:35,374 --> 00:39:37,239
Go! Let's go!

741
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:39,500
All right! Yeah!

742
00:39:40,746 --> 00:39:42,304
I didn't do nothing to you!

743
00:39:42,381 --> 00:39:44,576
- The end.
- You know what?

744
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:46,982
Laugh as much as you
want. I'll take a Ferrari

745
00:39:47,052 --> 00:39:49,020
and a kiss any day of the week.

746
00:39:49,088 --> 00:39:50,885
I'd just like to kiss a Ferrari.

747
00:39:52,491 --> 00:39:55,358
- All right. Good night.
- Good night, Uncle Skeeter.

748
00:39:55,427 --> 00:39:56,951
Good night, home slice.

749
00:39:57,029 --> 00:39:59,657
Thanks for the stories.

750
00:39:59,732 --> 00:40:01,632
You came up with all
the good parts, Bobbi.

751
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,531
Good night, y'all.

752
00:40:03,602 --> 00:40:05,297
You too there, Bugsy.

753
00:40:08,073 --> 00:40:11,702
<i>And them braids look fantastic.
They've taken years off you.</i>

754
00:40:11,777 --> 00:40:14,268
<i>You mind sleeping over? I'm
gonna duck out a few hours.</i>

755
00:40:14,346 --> 00:40:17,008
Oh, yeah, yeah. Mmm. By the way, um,

756
00:40:17,082 --> 00:40:19,209
I am, uh, legally obliged to tell you

757
00:40:19,284 --> 00:40:23,277
that I suffer from...
sleep panic disorder.

758
00:40:23,355 --> 00:40:25,880
OK, what's, uh, sleep panic disorder?

759
00:40:25,958 --> 00:40:28,449
<i>Believe me, you don't want to know.</i>

760
00:40:38,437 --> 00:40:42,396
<i>What am I thinking? Why would
anyone give me a free Ferrari?</i>

761
00:40:42,474 --> 00:40:44,704
I must be losing my mind.

762
00:40:46,578 --> 00:40:49,103
Much power of the horse
underneath that hood.

763
00:40:55,087 --> 00:40:56,247
Hello.

764
00:40:58,490 --> 00:41:00,287
Are you the guy I'm supposed to see?

765
00:41:03,028 --> 00:41:05,189
I'm here, aren't I?

766
00:41:07,232 --> 00:41:12,226
So... am I about to get
a cherry red Ferrari?

767
00:41:15,074 --> 00:41:16,405
I don't see why not.

768
00:41:23,282 --> 00:41:28,151
For... free?

769
00:41:29,288 --> 00:41:34,225
Sounds good to... me!

770
00:41:35,661 --> 00:41:38,152
What do I do now? Eat
a gumball or something?

771
00:41:39,565 --> 00:41:40,554
Yes.

772
00:41:44,770 --> 00:41:47,238
- Fell out of the sky, right?
- Yeah.

773
00:41:47,306 --> 00:41:48,295
Shh!

774
00:41:48,373 --> 00:41:50,364
Oh! Shh.

775
00:41:50,442 --> 00:41:51,807
I won't tell nobody.

776
00:41:54,346 --> 00:41:57,782
Now, close your eyes and count to three.

777
00:41:57,850 --> 00:41:59,613
- OK.
- Then it's all gonna happen.

778
00:41:59,685 --> 00:42:00,674
- No.
- Yeah.

779
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:04,780
- One, two...
- Yeah.

780
00:42:04,857 --> 00:42:05,949
...three.

781
00:42:06,024 --> 00:42:08,322
Ferrari!

782
00:42:08,393 --> 00:42:11,453
Hey! My wallet!

783
00:42:11,530 --> 00:42:13,259
Not anymore!

784
00:42:17,236 --> 00:42:20,137
Excuse me. Hi, boys.

785
00:42:23,342 --> 00:42:25,242
OK, thank you.

786
00:42:29,848 --> 00:42:32,840
Thanks, guys. Sorry. I'm
just trying to find my car.

787
00:42:34,386 --> 00:42:37,480
Good thing my wallet only
had three dollars in it.

788
00:42:37,556 --> 00:42:40,081
And my Derek Jeter baseball card!

789
00:42:40,159 --> 00:42:43,526
Guys, guys, stop, please.

790
00:42:44,763 --> 00:42:47,027
<i>You've had enough, now. Thank you.</i>

791
00:42:47,099 --> 00:42:48,191
Stop!

792
00:42:56,241 --> 00:42:57,765
Come on, man!

793
00:42:57,843 --> 00:43:00,573
- Care for a lift, ma'am?
- Skeeter?

794
00:43:00,646 --> 00:43:02,671
- Skeeter Bronson?
- Yes, ma'am.

795
00:43:05,017 --> 00:43:06,644
What do you say you boys

796
00:43:06,718 --> 00:43:09,209
<i>give the pretty lady back
the pictures you took?</i>

797
00:43:10,756 --> 00:43:13,987
Sure about that, now?
Because I beg to differ.

798
00:43:15,794 --> 00:43:16,886
Guy's got a gun!

799
00:43:19,598 --> 00:43:22,089
I'm just happy they didn't
make me use this thing.

800
00:43:26,238 --> 00:43:28,399
- My hero.
- Really?

801
00:43:28,473 --> 00:43:30,839
That was brilliant, Skeeter.

802
00:43:30,909 --> 00:43:33,878
<i>I don't know what happened.
Something came over me.</i>

803
00:43:33,946 --> 00:43:35,413
It felt good. It felt really good.

804
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:37,380
<i>How am I ever going to thank you?</i>

805
00:43:37,449 --> 00:43:39,212
Hmm.

806
00:43:39,284 --> 00:43:41,844
No thanks is necessary, ma'am?

807
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:45,651
Oh, am I in the presence of a gentleman?

808
00:43:45,724 --> 00:43:47,919
At your service, ma'am.

809
00:43:47,993 --> 00:43:51,485
Well, I must show my
appreciation in some form.

810
00:43:55,701 --> 00:43:57,100
Ow!

811
00:43:57,169 --> 00:43:59,831
Consider yourself big
people-bashed, sucker.

812
00:43:59,905 --> 00:44:01,395
I knew you were gonna show up.

813
00:44:01,473 --> 00:44:04,670
Get in the Gremlin, Jimmy,
before Sasquatch calls the cops.

814
00:44:04,743 --> 00:44:07,371
Yeah, 'cause that's how
we do what we do. Right?

815
00:44:07,446 --> 00:44:08,743
That's what you get, buddy.

816
00:44:08,814 --> 00:44:12,545
Oh! Oh! Oh! Let's go! Yeah!

817
00:44:12,618 --> 00:44:14,916
Pull me in. Let's get
out of here. Pull me in!

818
00:44:14,987 --> 00:44:17,649
Big people stink!

819
00:44:18,857 --> 00:44:21,553
<i>OK, well, you don't see that every day.</i>

820
00:44:21,627 --> 00:44:27,395
Indeed. And on that strange
note, I bid you good night.

821
00:44:27,466 --> 00:44:30,128
Yes, yes.

822
00:44:30,202 --> 00:44:34,002
Oh! Oh!

823
00:44:34,072 --> 00:44:36,939
All right, so that's how I'm getting it.

824
00:44:37,009 --> 00:44:40,069
- Getting what?
- This is just... I shouldn't.

825
00:44:40,145 --> 00:44:42,773
I, I couldn't. You know what?
I can. I'm gonna take it.

826
00:44:42,848 --> 00:44:44,748
What are you talking about?

827
00:44:44,816 --> 00:44:47,250
<i>I'm talking about a very generous girl</i>

828
00:44:47,319 --> 00:44:51,119
<i>who wants to give her rescuer
a cherry red Ferrari...</i>

829
00:44:51,189 --> 00:44:53,214
...for free!

830
00:44:54,192 --> 00:44:55,716
This is sick!

831
00:44:55,794 --> 00:44:59,560
Well, uh, good luck with
that. I'm just going to go.

832
00:44:59,631 --> 00:45:00,723
What do you mean?

833
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:02,767
<i>Do you have another one at your house?</i>

834
00:45:02,834 --> 00:45:05,268
Am I, am I supposed to
follow you or something?

835
00:45:05,337 --> 00:45:07,430
So seriously, no, no Ferrari?

836
00:45:11,109 --> 00:45:13,441
Where's the $100 million, at least?!

837
00:45:14,313 --> 00:45:15,507
Boo!

838
00:45:18,350 --> 00:45:20,614
<i>Hey, hey, hey! Get your
own campaign vehicle.</i>

839
00:45:20,686 --> 00:45:22,449
Yeah.

840
00:45:22,521 --> 00:45:25,251
- Hi.
- Hey, Aunt Jill.

841
00:45:25,324 --> 00:45:27,349
Hey, guys. How did last night go?

842
00:45:27,426 --> 00:45:30,827
An angry dwarf kicked me in the
leg, and I didn't get a free Ferrari.

843
00:45:30,896 --> 00:45:31,954
So there you go.

844
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:34,191
Oh. How sad.

845
00:45:34,266 --> 00:45:37,599
- He's talking about our bedtime story.
- Oh.

846
00:45:37,669 --> 00:45:40,900
Uncle Skeeter said Jeremiah
would get a new horse and a kiss,

847
00:45:40,972 --> 00:45:42,872
but I said the dwarf would kick him.

848
00:45:44,910 --> 00:45:46,639
You said it.

849
00:45:46,712 --> 00:45:48,680
Maybe that's how it works.

850
00:45:48,747 --> 00:45:50,339
The kids control the stories.

851
00:45:51,950 --> 00:45:54,885
And there are the wind chimes.
You know what that means.

852
00:45:54,953 --> 00:45:56,113
What what means?

853
00:45:56,188 --> 00:45:58,383
Huh?

854
00:45:58,457 --> 00:46:00,618
Nothing. Don't worry about it.

855
00:46:00,692 --> 00:46:01,750
I won't.

856
00:46:03,295 --> 00:46:06,958
OK, guys. Um, what is Bugsy doing?

857
00:46:09,968 --> 00:46:13,802
Working off the hamburgers
he ate last night.

858
00:46:13,872 --> 00:46:16,670
<i>Yes, I gave Bugsy some hamburgers,</i>

859
00:46:16,742 --> 00:46:20,303
<i>but I gave the children
that wheat germ stuff</i>

860
00:46:20,379 --> 00:46:22,040
<i>because that's what they love.</i>

861
00:46:22,114 --> 00:46:25,413
I guess it's, uh, Bugsy
watching the TV then too?

862
00:46:25,484 --> 00:46:28,078
Yeah, I flipped that on
and, look, he's glued to it.

863
00:46:31,923 --> 00:46:33,481
I'm innocent!

864
00:46:34,926 --> 00:46:36,359
What was that?

865
00:46:36,428 --> 00:46:39,659
<i>Uh... that was the sleep
panic disorder, I believe.</i>

866
00:46:39,731 --> 00:46:42,700
Why don't we, uh, get out of
here before the next attack.

867
00:46:42,768 --> 00:46:44,759
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Give your uncle a kiss.</i>

868
00:46:44,836 --> 00:46:47,168
<i>I'm a relative, I
deserve it. Right there.</i>

869
00:46:47,239 --> 00:46:48,934
Oh, that felt nice.

870
00:46:49,007 --> 00:46:50,941
How about one more for the road?

871
00:46:51,009 --> 00:46:54,672
- No.
- Come on, baby!

872
00:46:54,746 --> 00:46:57,408
Don't worry, we'll be back tonight.

873
00:46:57,482 --> 00:46:58,915
Yeah, no, I'm not worried.

874
00:46:58,984 --> 00:47:01,384
You're coming back, we
got a big story tonight!

875
00:47:01,453 --> 00:47:05,150
About some hotel theme ideas! Yeah!

876
00:47:05,223 --> 00:47:07,919
- Maybe we won't come back.
- What?

877
00:47:07,993 --> 00:47:10,553
- Skeeter?
- Sir Butt-Kiss. Sir... Kendall.

878
00:47:10,629 --> 00:47:15,362
I understand that you feel a need to
prepare for our little... showdown.

879
00:47:15,434 --> 00:47:17,265
- Yeah.
- That does not excuse you

880
00:47:17,335 --> 00:47:19,098
from maintenance responsibilities.

881
00:47:19,171 --> 00:47:21,105
- Oh, no. Check.
- Lights are out in the spa.

882
00:47:21,173 --> 00:47:23,607
<i>- The south service elevator is slow.
- Check.</i>

883
00:47:23,675 --> 00:47:25,233
Let me try that cheesecake.

884
00:47:26,545 --> 00:47:28,979
Oh, another thing.

885
00:47:29,047 --> 00:47:33,279
I heard about your big hero act
with my girlfriend last night.

886
00:47:33,351 --> 00:47:36,320
- This paparazzi was...
- I know what it is you're trying to do,

887
00:47:36,388 --> 00:47:38,151
and it's not gonna work.

888
00:47:38,223 --> 00:47:39,781
<i>You have to find another way</i>

889
00:47:39,858 --> 00:47:42,622
to cozy up to the old man
because I'm here to tell you

890
00:47:42,694 --> 00:47:46,926
Violet Nottingham is not gonna
date a gum-scraping handyman.

891
00:47:49,734 --> 00:47:50,792
Hey, Kendall.

892
00:47:52,404 --> 00:47:56,238
Two things. First off, you
got something right there.

893
00:47:56,308 --> 00:48:00,404
Yeah, now, use your hands.
That's disturbing to see.

894
00:48:00,479 --> 00:48:03,915
Good. Secondly, when I get
the job at the new hotel,

895
00:48:03,982 --> 00:48:08,146
I was actually considering keeping
you on, so watch your tone with me.

896
00:48:09,488 --> 00:48:13,185
<i>Your brief little trip to
the land of make-believe</i>

897
00:48:13,258 --> 00:48:15,453
<i>is just about over, my friend. OK?</i>

898
00:48:15,527 --> 00:48:18,826
We all know your failed father
ran this hotel into the ground,

899
00:48:18,897 --> 00:48:21,559
and thankfully, you will
not get the chance to make

900
00:48:21,633 --> 00:48:23,430
<i>the same mistake all over again.</i>

901
00:48:25,604 --> 00:48:26,969
May want to pick that up.

902
00:48:34,246 --> 00:48:36,111
<i>- It's Duncan.
- Lover, hello.</i>

903
00:48:36,181 --> 00:48:37,671
I'm looking for the hotel site.

904
00:48:37,749 --> 00:48:39,876
<i>I gave you the address, macho bunny.</i>

905
00:48:39,951 --> 00:48:42,681
<i>The address you gave me is no
good. There's a school here.</i>

906
00:48:42,754 --> 00:48:45,621
<i>- Oh, what school?
- Webster Elementary School.</i>

907
00:48:45,690 --> 00:48:48,454
<i>- Oh, then you're in the right place.
- Is that so?</i>

908
00:48:48,527 --> 00:48:51,257
<i>- This school is being shut down.
- Uh-huh.</i>

909
00:48:51,329 --> 00:48:54,264
<i>The old man pulled a few strings
at the board of education.</i>

910
00:48:54,332 --> 00:48:56,857
<i>- Really?
- We start demolition immediately.</i>

911
00:48:56,935 --> 00:48:59,062
<i>That is very exciting news.</i>

912
00:48:59,137 --> 00:49:01,367
<i>Oh, Pinky.</i>

913
00:49:06,411 --> 00:49:08,879
<i>Hello!</i>

914
00:49:08,947 --> 00:49:10,881
Skeeter? Hey, it's Wendy.

915
00:49:10,949 --> 00:49:14,146
<i>- Hey, sissy.
- Hey. How's it going?</i>

916
00:49:14,219 --> 00:49:16,847
<i>- Are the kids OK?
- Oh, yeah. We're having a blast.</i>

917
00:49:16,922 --> 00:49:18,389
<i>That was impressive, Bobbi,</i>

918
00:49:18,456 --> 00:49:21,550
<i>but Uncle Skeeter can jump
over the couch the long way.</i>

919
00:49:21,626 --> 00:49:24,959
<i>- Skeeter, can I talk to them?
- No, I'm taking them camping.</i>

920
00:49:25,030 --> 00:49:26,759
<i>- No.
- Have fun in Arizona. Bye!</i>

921
00:49:26,831 --> 00:49:29,766
Camping? No, Skeeter,
they could get poison ivy!

922
00:49:29,834 --> 00:49:32,667
- Let's go. Quietly.
- Where are we going?

923
00:49:32,737 --> 00:49:34,705
- Someplace special, fools.
- Whoo-hoo!

924
00:49:34,773 --> 00:49:38,504
Now march, march, march, march...

925
00:49:38,577 --> 00:49:40,374
<i>I don't know but it's been said</i>

926
00:49:40,445 --> 00:49:42,037
<i>Bugsy's eyes pop out of his head</i>

927
00:49:42,113 --> 00:49:44,343
March, march, march...

928
00:49:44,416 --> 00:49:46,543
- Whoo-hoo!
- March, let's go.

929
00:49:48,653 --> 00:49:49,881
Whoa! Cool!

930
00:49:49,955 --> 00:49:52,253
<i>We're going to have
ourselves a camp-out.</i>

931
00:49:52,324 --> 00:49:55,384
You guys, look what he's
done! Isn't this cool?

932
00:49:55,460 --> 00:49:57,860
- See? See how nice I am?
- Yeah.

933
00:49:57,929 --> 00:49:59,988
Whoa, OK, just be
careful around the fire.

934
00:50:00,065 --> 00:50:03,660
<i>Hey, Jill. Shh. Don't want
everyone to hear we're here.</i>

935
00:50:05,904 --> 00:50:10,068
I heard about marshmallows.
Saw them in magazines.

936
00:50:10,141 --> 00:50:13,076
<i>I never imagined they
would be this good.</i>

937
00:50:13,144 --> 00:50:16,238
<i>Let's just hope your mother
doesn't find out I gave you any.</i>

938
00:50:16,314 --> 00:50:18,976
- I won't tell her.
- I'm not talking about you.

939
00:50:19,050 --> 00:50:20,312
She's the weak link.

940
00:50:20,385 --> 00:50:22,819
I think I can let this one slide.

941
00:50:22,887 --> 00:50:25,947
Ahh! The mermaid's
being cool. Look at that.

942
00:50:26,024 --> 00:50:27,889
- The what?
- The nothing.

943
00:50:30,528 --> 00:50:33,827
You know, when we were younger and
your mom and I were out on the roof,

944
00:50:33,898 --> 00:50:36,230
my dad would always tell
us to look at the stars

945
00:50:36,301 --> 00:50:40,465
and see if you could make something
out of them. All right, like, uh...

946
00:50:40,538 --> 00:50:43,098
<i>Right over there. Right
over there. Look, look.</i>

947
00:50:43,174 --> 00:50:44,801
To me, that looks like a camel.

948
00:50:44,876 --> 00:50:46,969
You see the humps? Huh?
The tongue hanging out?

949
00:50:47,045 --> 00:50:48,410
Oh, yeah. I see that.

950
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:50,505
<i>Hey, look over there! It's a pyramid.</i>

951
00:50:50,582 --> 00:50:52,948
Yeah! Hey, good one, Patrick.

952
00:50:53,018 --> 00:50:55,919
Look, right next to the
moon. Right, right beside it.

953
00:50:55,987 --> 00:50:58,012
It looks exactly like Bugsy.

954
00:50:58,089 --> 00:51:00,489
Oh, my God!

955
00:51:00,558 --> 00:51:03,493
Don't worry, Bugsy. Your
eyes are still bigger.

956
00:51:07,399 --> 00:51:09,526
Uncle Skeeter?

957
00:51:09,601 --> 00:51:11,000
Yes, good-looking.

958
00:51:12,170 --> 00:51:14,536
Do you think my father will come back?

959
00:51:17,742 --> 00:51:21,473
Um... Well, that's a tough one.

960
00:51:24,382 --> 00:51:28,682
He must be going through
some... mental malfunction

961
00:51:28,753 --> 00:51:33,520
<i>to not want to be with you two
guys every second of the day.</i>

962
00:51:33,591 --> 00:51:38,221
But, uh, I do know this.

963
00:51:38,296 --> 00:51:40,924
<i>You're always going to have your mother.</i>

964
00:51:40,999 --> 00:51:44,264
<i>You're always gonna have
this girl to hang out with.</i>

965
00:51:44,335 --> 00:51:47,736
<i>And me, I ain't ever going anywhere.</i>

966
00:51:49,074 --> 00:51:50,564
OK?

967
00:51:50,642 --> 00:51:54,578
I'm like the stink on your
feet. I'll always be around.

968
00:51:59,884 --> 00:52:02,978
OK. You guys made me
late. I hope you're happy.

969
00:52:03,054 --> 00:52:05,852
<i>Well, thank you. Have
fun at night school.</i>

970
00:52:07,225 --> 00:52:09,022
See you tomorrow.

971
00:52:09,094 --> 00:52:11,460
All right, we got rid of
her, so let's get to business.

972
00:52:11,529 --> 00:52:13,394
Put the s'mores down. Story time.

973
00:52:13,465 --> 00:52:18,332
All right, guys. Tonight's
story's gonna be extra special.

974
00:52:18,403 --> 00:52:20,200
It's called...

975
00:52:20,271 --> 00:52:25,174
<i>... The Great Hotel Idea Story.</i>

976
00:52:25,243 --> 00:52:26,335
Yeah!

977
00:52:26,411 --> 00:52:28,606
- What?
- Boring.

978
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:30,580
Come on, guys, I really
need you to do this.

979
00:52:30,648 --> 00:52:32,411
It's gonna help my life a lot. Please?

980
00:52:33,651 --> 00:52:34,982
All right, you know what?

981
00:52:35,053 --> 00:52:37,351
<i>We still got one more night.
Let's have a fun story.</i>

982
00:52:37,422 --> 00:52:39,788
<i>How about some Evel Knievel stuff?</i>

983
00:52:39,858 --> 00:52:43,259
Racing, jumping, flying...

984
00:52:43,328 --> 00:52:45,728
Or maybe something like romantic?

985
00:52:47,699 --> 00:52:49,257
<i>I have a good idea.</i>

986
00:52:49,334 --> 00:52:52,462
Let's combine the action and the romance

987
00:52:52,537 --> 00:52:55,199
and make a romaction story.

988
00:52:55,273 --> 00:52:57,400
- Yeah.
- Let us begin.

989
00:52:57,475 --> 00:53:00,911
The greatest of all the
heroes in ancient Greece

990
00:53:00,979 --> 00:53:03,447
was, of course, Skeetacus.

991
00:53:04,949 --> 00:53:06,917
<i>He was truly amazing</i>

992
00:53:06,985 --> 00:53:11,979
<i>yet totally underrated and
had been ignored for years.</i>

993
00:53:12,056 --> 00:53:17,323
<i>Finally Skeetacus had his chance to
show his skills in the grand arena.</i>

994
00:53:19,097 --> 00:53:21,793
<i>If he could impress the
daughter of the emperor,</i>

995
00:53:21,866 --> 00:53:24,994
<i>he knew he would one day rule the land.</i>

996
00:53:28,006 --> 00:53:30,566
<i>- Skeetacus, Skeetacus!
- Go on, Skeetacus!</i>

997
00:53:30,642 --> 00:53:33,577
That's pretty fancy chariot work.

998
00:53:33,645 --> 00:53:35,078
For a peasant.

999
00:53:35,146 --> 00:53:37,910
<i>I see London, I see France</i>

1000
00:53:37,982 --> 00:53:40,314
<i>I see my golden underpants</i>

1001
00:53:40,385 --> 00:53:42,114
Whoo!

1002
00:53:51,429 --> 00:53:53,624
Oh, wh... what is he doing?

1003
00:53:54,833 --> 00:53:55,891
Whoa!

1004
00:54:00,705 --> 00:54:02,138
Bring on the elephants!

1005
00:54:05,543 --> 00:54:07,010
- Whoa.
- Ooh.

1006
00:54:08,413 --> 00:54:09,937
All right.

1007
00:54:10,014 --> 00:54:11,709
<i>You know how Hercules</i>

1008
00:54:11,783 --> 00:54:13,751
<i>supposedly founded the Olympics?</i>

1009
00:54:18,523 --> 00:54:22,550
<i>Well, Skeetacus invented the X Games.</i>

1010
00:54:22,627 --> 00:54:24,151
<i>He's never gonna make it!</i>

1011
00:54:37,542 --> 00:54:38,907
Now that's first class.

1012
00:54:40,445 --> 00:54:41,537
Hey!

1013
00:54:41,613 --> 00:54:43,478
<i>- Bravo!
- Wow.</i>

1014
00:54:45,383 --> 00:54:48,250
Can you dig it?

1015
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:50,514
Skeetacus!

1016
00:54:50,588 --> 00:54:52,419
How we doing so far, huh?

1017
00:54:52,490 --> 00:54:56,517
- This is the best story yet.
- Can we get to the romance now?

1018
00:54:56,594 --> 00:54:58,391
<i>Well, shorty, you tell me?</i>

1019
00:54:58,463 --> 00:55:00,988
<i>Does Skeetacus get
the girl he was after?</i>

1020
00:55:01,065 --> 00:55:02,532
<i>In these stories,</i>

1021
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:05,091
<i>the hero always gets the
fairest maiden in the land.</i>

1022
00:55:05,169 --> 00:55:07,660
Yes! You said it! OK,
so it's gonna happen!

1023
00:55:07,739 --> 00:55:10,799
Uh, right. So, what? They're
thirsty? They go off for drinks?

1024
00:55:10,875 --> 00:55:13,343
A little wine and cheese action? Yes?

1025
00:55:13,411 --> 00:55:18,405
<i>Yeah, they can go to an old
tavern. And guess who's there?</i>

1026
00:55:18,483 --> 00:55:20,417
Led Zeppelin. Say Led Zeppelin, please.

1027
00:55:20,485 --> 00:55:24,387
No. All the girls that were
mean to Skeetacus growing up.

1028
00:55:24,455 --> 00:55:26,753
What? Nobody was mean
to Skeetacus growing up.

1029
00:55:26,824 --> 00:55:28,655
He was like the coolest guy in school.

1030
00:55:28,726 --> 00:55:30,694
That's not what Mom said.

1031
00:55:30,762 --> 00:55:32,753
<i>All right, everybody
was mean to Skeetacus.</i>

1032
00:55:32,830 --> 00:55:35,594
He had problems. All
right, tell your story.

1033
00:55:35,667 --> 00:55:36,964
Oh, my God...

1034
00:55:37,035 --> 00:55:38,366
<i>They see he's now with</i>

1035
00:55:38,436 --> 00:55:40,199
<i>the fairest maiden in all the land,</i>

1036
00:55:40,271 --> 00:55:43,638
<i>and they are really jealous.</i>

1037
00:55:43,708 --> 00:55:45,869
<i>So jealous they don't know what to do.</i>

1038
00:55:45,944 --> 00:55:48,777
They just start nervously
doing the hokey-pokey.

1039
00:55:48,846 --> 00:55:50,677
<i>Put your right hand in</i>

1040
00:55:50,748 --> 00:55:52,545
<i>You put your right hand out</i>

1041
00:55:52,617 --> 00:55:54,312
<i>You put your right hand in</i>

1042
00:55:54,385 --> 00:55:56,319
<i>And you shake it all about</i>

1043
00:55:57,689 --> 00:55:59,247
OK.

1044
00:55:59,324 --> 00:56:01,349
<i>So then,</i>

1045
00:56:01,426 --> 00:56:04,088
<i>Skeetacus takes his
date out to the beach.</i>

1046
00:56:04,162 --> 00:56:07,359
<i>All of a sudden, a big hairy guy</i>

1047
00:56:07,432 --> 00:56:10,731
<i>washes up onshore, passed out.</i>

1048
00:56:10,802 --> 00:56:12,667
<i>Why a hairy guy? I don't get it.</i>

1049
00:56:12,737 --> 00:56:13,829
<i>Just 'cause.</i>

1050
00:56:13,905 --> 00:56:17,102
<i>He had something stuck in his
throat, and he wasn't breathing.</i>

1051
00:56:20,712 --> 00:56:24,307
- Thanks.
- He's OK.

1052
00:56:24,382 --> 00:56:27,579
<i>And then it starts pouring, so
they run into a magical cave.</i>

1053
00:56:27,652 --> 00:56:30,621
<i>- Caves are nice.
- And Abe Lincoln's there.</i>

1054
00:56:30,688 --> 00:56:33,020
Abe Lincoln? What,
is this a joke to you?

1055
00:56:33,091 --> 00:56:35,958
What the heck's the matter
with you? Oh, I'm sorry.

1056
00:56:36,027 --> 00:56:37,221
I, I didn't mean to yell.

1057
00:56:37,295 --> 00:56:39,786
The Abe Lincoln thing,
that's, that's a good idea.

1058
00:56:39,864 --> 00:56:43,823
It's just that, uh...
Does Skeetacus get a kiss?

1059
00:56:43,901 --> 00:56:47,302
Don't you think he should?
It's... been a long time for him.

1060
00:56:47,372 --> 00:56:52,469
<i>His lips are very dry
from not using them.</i>

1061
00:56:52,543 --> 00:56:54,170
Bugsy, you with me?

1062
00:56:57,215 --> 00:56:58,807
We'll see.

1063
00:56:58,883 --> 00:57:01,443
<i>- Hello?
- Mmm.</i>

1064
00:57:01,519 --> 00:57:04,147
Hey, is this the fairest
maiden in the land?

1065
00:57:04,222 --> 00:57:06,247
Mr. Skeeter Bronson, is that you?

1066
00:57:06,324 --> 00:57:09,623
<i>Yes, it is. Sorry about that
Ferrari confusion the other night.</i>

1067
00:57:09,694 --> 00:57:13,130
I'm here at the beach right now and
I had a hunch you might be here too.

1068
00:57:13,197 --> 00:57:14,960
What do you say we
get a little lunchsky?

1069
00:57:15,033 --> 00:57:16,523
<i>That sounds so delightful.</i>

1070
00:57:16,601 --> 00:57:19,627
But I can't. I'm afraid I'm
on my way to Vegas for the day.

1071
00:57:20,838 --> 00:57:22,066
Vegas?

1072
00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:24,506
Uh, no one talked about Vegas.

1073
00:57:24,575 --> 00:57:26,839
Don't tell Kendall. He
thinks I'm in the library.

1074
00:57:26,911 --> 00:57:29,243
Yeah, no. But, but, uh, princess,

1075
00:57:29,313 --> 00:57:31,508
I, I really thought we
were gonna hang out today.

1076
00:57:31,582 --> 00:57:34,312
Oh, well. I will see you
at Daddy's birthday party.

1077
00:57:34,385 --> 00:57:35,374
<i>Bye, Skeeter.</i>

1078
00:57:36,587 --> 00:57:38,316
Hmm.

1079
00:57:38,389 --> 00:57:41,415
<i>So our date's gonna be
tomorrow? I can live with that.</i>

1080
00:57:41,492 --> 00:57:44,518
Hey! Look out! Look out!

1081
00:57:44,595 --> 00:57:48,964
Sorry. Are you OK? Hey! I'm so sorry!

1082
00:57:49,033 --> 00:57:52,264
What is it about the cushion
of protection you don't like?

1083
00:57:52,336 --> 00:57:54,861
Aren't you supposed to be in school?

1084
00:57:54,939 --> 00:57:56,804
I'm supposed to be
looking for a job now,

1085
00:57:56,874 --> 00:58:00,037
but for some reason I felt
like coming to the beach today.

1086
00:58:00,111 --> 00:58:01,339
Huh.

1087
00:58:01,412 --> 00:58:02,879
Um, are you hungry?

1088
00:58:02,947 --> 00:58:05,939
Yes, I'm always hungry when I'm in pain.

1089
00:58:06,017 --> 00:58:08,110
Good. Because I'm buying.

1090
00:58:08,186 --> 00:58:10,950
I'll let you buy me lunch.
Somebody stole my wallet,

1091
00:58:11,022 --> 00:58:14,219
- so how was I gonna pay?
- Of course you got your wallet stolen.

1092
00:58:14,292 --> 00:58:17,625
- I don't know what that means.
- You. It's always something with you.

1093
00:58:17,695 --> 00:58:19,526
- Huh?
- You're wearing my hat.

1094
00:58:19,597 --> 00:58:22,122
- Gonna wear that all day?
- I'm not wearing nobody's hat.

1095
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:24,896
- I'm wearing your hat! Oh!
- I'll take it back. Thanks.

1096
00:58:31,309 --> 00:58:33,106
This is perfect for your free lunch.

1097
00:58:33,177 --> 00:58:36,237
<i>Oh, my gosh. You guys, you
guys, you guys. Over there.</i>

1098
00:58:36,314 --> 00:58:38,248
Is that... is that Skeeter Bronson?

1099
00:58:38,316 --> 00:58:39,783
- Stop it.
- Oh, my God.

1100
00:58:39,851 --> 00:58:42,217
- Oh, my God.
- Skeeter.

1101
00:58:42,286 --> 00:58:44,481
Hey! Do you remember me?

1102
00:58:44,555 --> 00:58:47,456
It's Donna Hynde from high school.

1103
00:58:47,525 --> 00:58:49,288
Yeah, I do.

1104
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:52,955
Thought I was going to run into
you shortly. And here you are.

1105
00:58:53,030 --> 00:58:56,261
Yeah. Wow, this is so... weird. Uh...

1106
00:58:56,334 --> 00:58:58,802
We were just planning
our high school reunion.

1107
00:58:58,870 --> 00:59:02,135
We were totally just talking
about you. It's so weird.

1108
00:59:02,206 --> 00:59:04,174
I was just talking about you guys too.

1109
00:59:04,242 --> 00:59:05,732
Sure, he was.

1110
00:59:05,810 --> 00:59:08,472
Mind pretending to be my
girlfriend for a second?

1111
00:59:08,546 --> 00:59:10,480
Yeah, I don't feel
comfortable doing that.

1112
00:59:10,548 --> 00:59:12,914
<i>I'll, uh, convert my truck to biodiesel.</i>

1113
00:59:14,852 --> 00:59:16,342
- OK, I'll do it.
- Ding-dong.

1114
00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:19,583
Uh, this is my girlfriend,
guys. This is Jill.

1115
00:59:19,657 --> 00:59:21,352
Hello.

1116
00:59:21,425 --> 00:59:22,949
She's your girlfriend?

1117
00:59:23,027 --> 00:59:24,460
Yeah. Yeah.

1118
00:59:24,529 --> 00:59:26,087
Yes, I am.

1119
00:59:26,164 --> 00:59:27,495
- Right?
- Yup.

1120
00:59:27,565 --> 00:59:29,795
She thinks I'm...

1121
00:59:29,867 --> 00:59:33,268
You want me to... Oh. Uh... romantic.

1122
00:59:33,337 --> 00:59:35,202
She likes how romantic I can be.

1123
00:59:35,273 --> 00:59:38,299
And, uh, "great kisser,"
she likes to say.

1124
00:59:38,376 --> 00:59:41,709
Oh, yeah. That's... a little too much.

1125
00:59:41,779 --> 00:59:44,839
- Oh. Sorry.
- Wow, you are really pretty.

1126
00:59:44,916 --> 00:59:47,214
- I mean, she's all right.
- Thanks.

1127
00:59:47,285 --> 00:59:50,152
<i>I've seen hotter, but she's pretty cool.</i>

1128
00:59:50,221 --> 00:59:51,552
So super skinny.

1129
00:59:51,622 --> 00:59:55,251
Skinnier than you. But... Yeah.

1130
00:59:56,627 --> 00:59:57,651
<i>Whatever.</i>

1131
00:59:57,728 --> 01:00:00,356
I feel really awful
saying this out loud.

1132
01:00:00,431 --> 01:00:05,198
We were really terrible to Skeeter
in high school. Awful. So mean.

1133
01:00:05,269 --> 01:00:06,702
My Skeeter?

1134
01:00:06,771 --> 01:00:09,171
- They were.
- You had a hard time in high school?

1135
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:12,903
Look at you now. You
turned out pretty... cute.

1136
01:00:12,977 --> 01:00:14,535
- Yeah!
- You know...

1137
01:00:14,612 --> 01:00:17,740
the pimples went away,
and, uh, these came to play.

1138
01:00:20,384 --> 01:00:22,249
- You want to touch them?
- Oh, that's OK.

1139
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:25,448
- Later, later.
- They're here for you. Ding-dong.

1140
01:00:26,724 --> 01:00:28,385
<i>You put your right hand in</i>

1141
01:00:28,459 --> 01:00:30,859
<i>You put your right hand out</i>

1142
01:00:30,928 --> 01:00:32,520
<i>You put your right hand in</i>

1143
01:00:32,597 --> 01:00:34,462
<i>- And you shake it all about
- OK.</i>

1144
01:00:34,532 --> 01:00:36,557
<i>- I think we should leave.
- Yes.</i>

1145
01:00:36,634 --> 01:00:38,499
<i>And you turn yourself around</i>

1146
01:00:38,569 --> 01:00:41,003
<i>- All right. Bye-bye.
- That's what it's all about</i>

1147
01:00:41,072 --> 01:00:42,334
What's happening?

1148
01:00:42,406 --> 01:00:44,704
Hey, so I spoke to Wendy.

1149
01:00:44,775 --> 01:00:46,675
She's excited to see the kids tomorrow.

1150
01:00:46,744 --> 01:00:48,769
This is the longest
she's been away from them.

1151
01:00:48,846 --> 01:00:53,442
That's right. This is my
last night with the kids.

1152
01:00:53,517 --> 01:00:55,314
<i>You know, they're gonna be devastated.</i>

1153
01:00:55,386 --> 01:00:57,047
They worship you

1154
01:00:57,121 --> 01:00:59,885
<i>and those amazing bedtime
stories you've been telling them.</i>

1155
01:00:59,957 --> 01:01:02,721
Oh, well, they say all
the good parts. I promise.

1156
01:01:02,793 --> 01:01:04,886
Oh, my gosh. Is he unconscious?

1157
01:01:04,962 --> 01:01:06,054
Yeah, yeah.

1158
01:01:08,532 --> 01:01:10,966
Boom! Oh.

1159
01:01:12,503 --> 01:01:13,800
Thanks!

1160
01:01:14,872 --> 01:01:16,032
Whoa!

1161
01:01:16,107 --> 01:01:17,972
- Yeah?
- Check out Mr. Smooth.

1162
01:01:18,042 --> 01:01:21,637
Well, you know, I do what I do.

1163
01:01:21,712 --> 01:01:24,272
- Think we should get out of this rain?
- What rain?

1164
01:01:26,951 --> 01:01:28,680
Oh, shoot! Where did that come from?

1165
01:01:28,753 --> 01:01:30,550
I don't know! Isn't it amazing?

1166
01:01:30,621 --> 01:01:33,749
<i>- Let's get out of this!
- Let's go! Let's get out! Move it!</i>

1167
01:01:35,726 --> 01:01:37,990
I can read the future.

1168
01:01:40,197 --> 01:01:43,325
Good God. So...

1169
01:01:43,401 --> 01:01:47,667
So... The big presentation's
tomorrow, right?

1170
01:01:47,738 --> 01:01:50,400
I know you're not nervous
or anything, but, um...

1171
01:01:50,474 --> 01:01:51,805
good luck on it anyway.

1172
01:01:51,876 --> 01:01:53,241
- Thank you.
- Yep.

1173
01:01:53,311 --> 01:01:57,645
Actually, you can come if
you want. It's like a party.

1174
01:01:57,715 --> 01:02:00,445
You know, Wendy's gonna
be watching the kids,

1175
01:02:00,518 --> 01:02:01,815
<i>and we could have fun.</i>

1176
01:02:01,886 --> 01:02:03,513
You can meet me there.

1177
01:02:04,555 --> 01:02:06,648
Yeah. That would, uh...

1178
01:02:06,724 --> 01:02:10,387
I could do that. I could meet you, um...

1179
01:02:10,461 --> 01:02:13,089
...after night school or something.

1180
01:02:14,999 --> 01:02:17,092
It's you?

1181
01:02:17,168 --> 01:02:19,329
It's me what?

1182
01:02:20,938 --> 01:02:23,839
You're the fairest maiden in the land?

1183
01:02:25,876 --> 01:02:29,073
"Fair" as in "doesn't
cheat at checkers"?

1184
01:02:31,115 --> 01:02:33,583
No, fairest as in...

1185
01:02:35,186 --> 01:02:37,211
..."beautifulest."

1186
01:02:47,198 --> 01:02:50,065
Wait, wait. Something
weird's gonna happen.

1187
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:53,000
Oh.

1188
01:02:53,070 --> 01:02:56,164
No, yeah, we don't... This is a mistake.

1189
01:02:56,240 --> 01:03:00,176
No, no, no, not between
us. I mean like, some...

1190
01:03:00,244 --> 01:03:03,111
No! No, no! Oh, here comes Abe!

1191
01:03:03,948 --> 01:03:05,711
No!

1192
01:03:14,592 --> 01:03:16,184
Ah! Look.

1193
01:03:17,161 --> 01:03:19,686
- Wow, a penny.
- No, no, no.

1194
01:03:19,764 --> 01:03:22,858
This is the weird thing I was
talking about. Abe Lincoln.

1195
01:03:22,933 --> 01:03:25,834
- Yeah. Yeah.
- No, no, no, no.

1196
01:03:25,903 --> 01:03:28,838
Abe's not gonna interrupt
this time. That was it.

1197
01:03:28,906 --> 01:03:30,635
It's supposed to end better than this.

1198
01:03:30,708 --> 01:03:33,768
Stick around. I'm tellin' ya,
you're gonna be missing out.

1199
01:03:35,413 --> 01:03:37,540
Nice imagination, Patrick.

1200
01:03:45,389 --> 01:03:47,118
- Skeeter?
- Yo.

1201
01:03:47,191 --> 01:03:49,921
<i>We've got a little bit of a
shaving situation in there.</i>

1202
01:03:49,994 --> 01:03:52,326
Oh, no, no, no. I took
the razor blades out.

1203
01:03:52,396 --> 01:03:54,227
Don't worry. Their father ain't around,

1204
01:03:54,298 --> 01:03:56,459
<i>I figured someone has to
teach them how to shave.</i>

1205
01:03:58,102 --> 01:04:00,536
I'm Princess Leia.

1206
01:04:00,604 --> 01:04:02,299
Uh-huh.

1207
01:04:04,074 --> 01:04:06,634
So, are you ready for the
big showdown tomorrow night?

1208
01:04:06,710 --> 01:04:07,699
Oh, yeah.

1209
01:04:07,778 --> 01:04:09,075
What I'm going to do is

1210
01:04:09,146 --> 01:04:11,080
tell them a bedtime story tonight.

1211
01:04:11,148 --> 01:04:13,946
<i>I'll have me win in the story.</i>

1212
01:04:14,018 --> 01:04:17,545
Then I'll win for reals. Do you dig?

1213
01:04:17,621 --> 01:04:19,316
Oh, right. Yeah, yeah, I understand.

1214
01:04:19,390 --> 01:04:21,620
<i>So it's like, um,
positive visualization.</i>

1215
01:04:21,692 --> 01:04:23,421
I read a book on that once.

1216
01:04:24,395 --> 01:04:26,693
<i>Read the back cover, at least.</i>

1217
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:31,097
I can't read.

1218
01:04:32,636 --> 01:04:34,866
Shut up, Bugsy!

1219
01:04:34,939 --> 01:04:37,567
<i>I've got opposable thumbs.
How do you feel about that?</i>

1220
01:04:39,677 --> 01:04:41,235
You children ready?

1221
01:04:41,312 --> 01:04:44,042
Because here comes our last story.

1222
01:04:45,216 --> 01:04:47,912
<i>The fate of the entire universe</i>

1223
01:04:47,985 --> 01:04:49,816
hung in the balance,

1224
01:04:49,887 --> 01:04:52,151
as the Supreme Galactic Council

1225
01:04:52,223 --> 01:04:54,657
<i>met to determine who would control</i>

1226
01:04:54,725 --> 01:04:59,924
<i>the new planet in the vast
Nottinghamian star system.</i>

1227
01:05:01,732 --> 01:05:05,634
<i>Most in attendance expected
Supreme Leader Barracto</i>

1228
01:05:05,703 --> 01:05:08,900
<i>to rule in favor of General Kendallo,</i>

1229
01:05:08,973 --> 01:05:11,806
<i>the evil governor of Hotelium.</i>

1230
01:05:13,410 --> 01:05:16,072
<i>But there was a wild card in the mix...</i>

1231
01:05:17,214 --> 01:05:19,842
<i>... Skeeto Bronsonnian</i>

1232
01:05:19,917 --> 01:05:22,943
<i>and his sidekick, Mickey Doo Quicky Doo.</i>

1233
01:05:24,588 --> 01:05:26,488
<i>They all watched with excitement.</i>

1234
01:05:26,557 --> 01:05:29,117
<i>Lieutenant Jilli and
her two young cadets,</i>

1235
01:05:29,193 --> 01:05:33,220
<i>Aspenoff, and even the
great Captain Bugzoid.</i>

1236
01:05:33,297 --> 01:05:37,825
<i>Hey, since it's outer space, Skeeto
should talk like a goofy alien.</i>

1237
01:05:37,902 --> 01:05:41,065
<i>What?</i>

1238
01:05:43,307 --> 01:05:46,208
That's disgusting. I'm not
going to translate that.

1239
01:05:46,277 --> 01:05:47,505
Silence!

1240
01:05:47,578 --> 01:05:48,977
The leader of the new planet

1241
01:05:49,046 --> 01:05:52,243
shall be determined
the old-fashioned way:

1242
01:05:52,316 --> 01:05:55,547
<i>A zero-gravity fight.</i>

1243
01:06:07,298 --> 01:06:10,597
<i>OK, now we get to the
part the crowd came to see.</i>

1244
01:06:10,668 --> 01:06:13,762
<i>Skeeto defeating Kendallo, right?</i>

1245
01:06:15,739 --> 01:06:18,333
<i>I think we need to
see them battle first.</i>

1246
01:06:30,721 --> 01:06:32,916
<i>Kendallo makes the first move.</i>

1247
01:06:44,001 --> 01:06:45,901
<i>- Skeeto!
- But the kids</i>

1248
01:06:45,970 --> 01:06:48,165
<i>really want to see Skeeto
kick his butt, right?</i>

1249
01:06:57,348 --> 01:06:59,077
Wet willy.

1250
01:06:59,149 --> 01:07:01,674
Boring!

1251
01:07:01,752 --> 01:07:04,414
Uh, bring out the booger monster!

1252
01:07:08,726 --> 01:07:10,887
<i>Oh, I think I'm gonna be sick.</i>

1253
01:07:20,671 --> 01:07:24,266
<i>All right, have the booger
monster smack Kendallo around.</i>

1254
01:07:24,341 --> 01:07:26,741
<i>No, I think he should kiss him.</i>

1255
01:07:29,613 --> 01:07:31,945
<i>Would you get to Skeeto winning already?</i>

1256
01:07:32,016 --> 01:07:33,950
<i>OK.</i>

1257
01:07:37,087 --> 01:07:38,850
Whoa!

1258
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:48,764
Arise, Skeeto, sharif of Nottinghamia.

1259
01:07:58,108 --> 01:07:59,575
- Whoopee!
- Whoo!

1260
01:08:02,079 --> 01:08:04,707
And that is the perfect ending

1261
01:08:04,782 --> 01:08:06,647
to our last story.

1262
01:08:06,717 --> 01:08:08,184
Thank you, children.

1263
01:08:08,252 --> 01:08:09,844
Oh, that's not the ending.

1264
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:11,820
<i>Yeah. That would be too obvious.</i>

1265
01:08:11,889 --> 01:08:12,878
What do you mean?

1266
01:08:12,956 --> 01:08:14,548
Somebody threw a fireball at Skeeto

1267
01:08:14,625 --> 01:08:16,786
and Skeeto got incineratated.

1268
01:08:18,762 --> 01:08:21,322
- The end.
- "Incineratated"?

1269
01:08:21,398 --> 01:08:24,697
<i>You mean "incinerated"?</i>

1270
01:08:24,768 --> 01:08:27,896
No! No, no! He can't catch on fire.

1271
01:08:27,971 --> 01:08:30,565
Yeah. I'm Captain Skeeto. I'm on fire!

1272
01:08:30,641 --> 01:08:33,075
No, no, no. The story
can't end like that.

1273
01:08:33,143 --> 01:08:34,974
What happened to a nice, happy ending?

1274
01:08:35,045 --> 01:08:38,173
You said happy endings
don't really happen.

1275
01:08:38,248 --> 01:08:39,738
We want our story to be real.

1276
01:08:39,817 --> 01:08:42,047
Oh, I was just saying
that. I was stupid.

1277
01:08:42,119 --> 01:08:43,677
No, no, no, no, no.

1278
01:08:43,754 --> 01:08:46,245
<i>So, what? We're really going
to have me on fire? Hey!</i>

1279
01:08:46,323 --> 01:08:49,451
Don't fall asleep, or the story
will lock. Stop it! Wake up!

1280
01:08:49,526 --> 01:08:51,926
Wake up. Wake up. Wake up.

1281
01:08:52,062 --> 01:08:55,463
<i>I can't believe Skeeter didn't tell you.</i>

1282
01:08:55,532 --> 01:08:58,524
And I'm sure it's just a
coincidence that the new hotel

1283
01:08:58,602 --> 01:09:02,470
is going up right here where
the, where the school is.

1284
01:09:02,539 --> 01:09:04,439
Well, I'm pretty sure...

1285
01:09:04,508 --> 01:09:05,497
Excuse me. Yeah.

1286
01:09:05,576 --> 01:09:07,703
<i>Everything's ready for the presentation.</i>

1287
01:09:07,778 --> 01:09:09,245
<i>- Good.
- Ten-four, rubber duck.</i>

1288
01:09:09,313 --> 01:09:10,905
Got it. Great.

1289
01:09:14,351 --> 01:09:15,375
<i>Oh, uh</i>

1290
01:09:15,452 --> 01:09:18,080
<i>Fire</i>

1291
01:09:21,692 --> 01:09:24,160
<i>Oh, oh, oh I'm on fire</i>

1292
01:09:26,563 --> 01:09:27,860
<i>Is this burning</i>

1293
01:09:27,931 --> 01:09:29,159
<i>An et...</i>

1294
01:09:30,634 --> 01:09:32,659
<i>Burn, baby, burn</i>

1295
01:09:34,471 --> 01:09:38,373
OK. The good news is, you're
going to win the competition.

1296
01:09:38,442 --> 01:09:41,377
The bad news is, you're
probably gonna catch on fire,

1297
01:09:41,445 --> 01:09:44,539
but not if you take a few precautions.

1298
01:09:45,449 --> 01:09:47,644
<i>Oven mitts, smoke alarm.</i>

1299
01:09:51,221 --> 01:09:52,210
Yeah.

1300
01:09:53,390 --> 01:09:57,019
"Flame-resistant Christmas
tree spray." Yeah.

1301
01:09:58,562 --> 01:10:00,928
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, this will work.

1302
01:10:01,698 --> 01:10:02,756
Excuse me. Sir?

1303
01:10:02,833 --> 01:10:04,664
Those are actually for Christmas trees.

1304
01:10:04,735 --> 01:10:05,793
I know. 'Tis the season.

1305
01:10:05,869 --> 01:10:08,064
- Ow! God!
- I'm so sorry.

1306
01:10:08,138 --> 01:10:09,605
It burns!

1307
01:10:09,673 --> 01:10:10,970
Here, let me make it up to you.

1308
01:10:11,041 --> 01:10:12,838
- Ow!
- It's for trees!

1309
01:10:12,910 --> 01:10:14,309
It's for trees!

1310
01:10:14,378 --> 01:10:16,039
You're right! That hurts!

1311
01:10:17,381 --> 01:10:19,315
I'm sorry about that!

1312
01:10:28,192 --> 01:10:30,854
Antibacterial wipes, anybody?

1313
01:10:30,928 --> 01:10:33,089
Aloha. Aloha.

1314
01:10:33,163 --> 01:10:34,596
Thank you so much.

1315
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:38,397
Whoa!

1316
01:10:39,503 --> 01:10:42,495
Steady. Steady.

1317
01:10:47,845 --> 01:10:50,313
- Kona coffee ice cream.
- Yeah? What's the catch?

1318
01:10:50,380 --> 01:10:53,008
You're gonna light it on fire?
'Cause I'm on to you, honey.

1319
01:10:53,083 --> 01:10:55,142
No fire. It would melt.

1320
01:10:55,219 --> 01:10:57,813
Just take the ice
cream and a chill pill.

1321
01:11:07,564 --> 01:11:10,055
- Ah!
- Boo!

1322
01:11:10,133 --> 01:11:12,567
- Skeeter.
- Yes.

1323
01:11:12,636 --> 01:11:14,695
<i>- That wasn't very nice.
- What wasn't?</i>

1324
01:11:14,771 --> 01:11:17,239
- You pushed that man in the pool.
- No, he jumped in.

1325
01:11:17,307 --> 01:11:18,433
Hey, you see Jill around?

1326
01:11:18,508 --> 01:11:21,375
No, I ain't, I ain't
seen Jill tonight, mate.

1327
01:11:26,416 --> 01:11:28,043
Ooh! I am cold.

1328
01:11:28,118 --> 01:11:30,712
I'll get you a towel.

1329
01:11:30,787 --> 01:11:32,516
<i>- I've got your towel.
- Oh, blimey.</i>

1330
01:11:32,589 --> 01:11:34,250
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1331
01:11:37,060 --> 01:11:38,322
<i>I love you.</i>

1332
01:11:42,666 --> 01:11:44,691
You brought me a grilled
cheese sandwich once.

1333
01:11:44,768 --> 01:11:45,757
Yeah. I did, yes.

1334
01:11:45,836 --> 01:11:47,736
It was Monterey Jack.
It's a good cheese.

1335
01:11:51,241 --> 01:11:53,106
Ow!

1336
01:11:53,176 --> 01:11:54,438
Skeeter, are you all right?

1337
01:11:54,511 --> 01:11:57,275
A bee stung my tongue!

1338
01:11:59,249 --> 01:12:03,242
<i>The meeting for the exciting new hotel
will take place in the living room.</i>

1339
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:06,118
So I don't think you're
going to want to miss this.

1340
01:12:06,189 --> 01:12:08,350
No, it's swelling up!

1341
01:12:12,663 --> 01:12:15,962
- Can I sit there, please, mate?
- Yes, of course.

1342
01:12:16,033 --> 01:12:18,433
- Don't touch me.
- Sorry.

1343
01:12:18,502 --> 01:12:21,300
Before we begin, I
would just like to say,

1344
01:12:21,371 --> 01:12:24,033
personally, happy birthday.

1345
01:12:24,107 --> 01:12:25,631
Happy birthday.

1346
01:12:25,709 --> 01:12:26,971
Happy birthday, Daddy.

1347
01:12:27,044 --> 01:12:28,375
Thank you, Kendall.

1348
01:12:28,445 --> 01:12:31,039
Yes, now, as you can see,

1349
01:12:31,114 --> 01:12:33,412
<i>I've invited some of the staff to sit in</i>

1350
01:12:33,483 --> 01:12:37,180
to see how your ideas would
play with the "regular folk."

1351
01:12:37,254 --> 01:12:40,280
- No offense.
- None taken, Barry. None taken.

1352
01:12:41,591 --> 01:12:42,717
So, gentlemen,

1353
01:12:42,793 --> 01:12:44,727
which of you would like to go first?

1354
01:12:47,264 --> 01:12:48,356
Fair enough.

1355
01:12:49,833 --> 01:12:52,666
Mr. Nottingham, you
were absolutely right

1356
01:12:52,736 --> 01:12:56,228
when you said the rock
and roll theme was old hat.

1357
01:12:58,709 --> 01:13:01,439
Gone. Your insight, sir,

1358
01:13:01,511 --> 01:13:04,571
has inspired me to, to dig deeper,

1359
01:13:04,648 --> 01:13:07,481
to find the commonality at the heart

1360
01:13:07,551 --> 01:13:09,018
of the American experience.

1361
01:13:09,086 --> 01:13:11,020
I speak, of course...

1362
01:13:11,088 --> 01:13:13,022
...of the musical theater.

1363
01:13:13,090 --> 01:13:15,650
And, more specifically...

1364
01:13:16,593 --> 01:13:17,924
...Broadway!

1365
01:13:21,365 --> 01:13:22,832
Hit it.

1366
01:13:22,899 --> 01:13:27,029
<i>Oh, when you first pull up</i>

1367
01:13:27,104 --> 01:13:29,129
<i>To the grand front door</i>

1368
01:13:29,206 --> 01:13:32,437

<i>At the Nottingham Broadway Mega Resort</i>

1370
01:13:38,048 --> 01:13:41,017
<i>Oh there's a pool for the Sharks</i>

1371
01:13:41,084 --> 01:13:42,813
<i>A pool for the Jets</i>

1372
01:13:42,886 --> 01:13:46,549

01:14:04,074 --> 01:14:05,302
Thank you, Kendall.

1377
01:14:05,375 --> 01:14:07,172
Thank you, sir.

1378
01:14:14,184 --> 01:14:16,209
Uh, sorry about that.

1379
01:14:16,286 --> 01:14:19,255
I was, uh, just resting my eyes.

1380
01:14:22,893 --> 01:14:25,487
Skeeter. You're up.

1381
01:14:42,345 --> 01:14:43,835
Are you all right, Skeeter?

1382
01:14:45,749 --> 01:14:48,309
A bee bit my tongue.

1383
01:14:49,019 --> 01:14:50,043
I'm sorry?

1384
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:53,851
A bee... stung my tongue.

1385
01:14:57,661 --> 01:14:59,492
"A bee stung my tongue."

1386
01:14:59,563 --> 01:15:02,555
Oh, you understand him? Oh.

1387
01:15:02,632 --> 01:15:05,965
How did a bee sting your tongue?

1388
01:15:06,036 --> 01:15:07,401
Uh...

1389
01:15:07,471 --> 01:15:09,939
I was eating ice cream,
and suddenly a bee...

1390
01:15:10,006 --> 01:15:13,464
Uh, it was on an ice
cream, and he licked it.

1391
01:15:13,543 --> 01:15:17,570
Hmm. Can you translate
Skeeter's presentation for us?

1392
01:15:17,647 --> 01:15:19,945
- Mmm!
- Uh... Yes!

1393
01:15:20,016 --> 01:15:21,483
Yes, I can do that.

1394
01:15:23,787 --> 01:15:25,379
Thank you. Ready?

1395
01:15:25,455 --> 01:15:27,514
- I'm ready. OK.
- Ready?

1396
01:15:34,731 --> 01:15:39,065
<i>"I spent the last week in the
hotel, the hotel where I live..."</i>

1397
01:15:39,136 --> 01:15:41,434
With my niece and nephew.

1398
01:15:41,505 --> 01:15:43,837
"With my niece and my nephew."

1399
01:15:48,311 --> 01:15:53,271
<i>"To a kid, everything about a
hotel is strange and wonderful."</i>

1400
01:15:54,851 --> 01:15:57,411
"Sleeping in a different bed."

1401
01:15:59,122 --> 01:16:00,680
"Hanging out in the lobby."

1402
01:16:02,893 --> 01:16:05,123
"Jumping up and down on the alligator."

1403
01:16:10,267 --> 01:16:12,997
<i>"Riding up and down in the elevator."</i>

1404
01:16:13,069 --> 01:16:14,127
Ah!

1405
01:16:14,204 --> 01:16:16,001
Sorry. Yeah, I see now that an alligator

1406
01:16:16,072 --> 01:16:17,699
wouldn't be in that context.

1407
01:16:23,747 --> 01:16:28,150
"Some hotels try to make it seem
as much like home as possible."

1408
01:16:29,986 --> 01:16:31,954
"But they're missing the point."

1409
01:16:36,693 --> 01:16:40,356
"If you wanted to stay in a place
like home, then why not stay at home?"

1410
01:16:44,634 --> 01:16:48,161
<i>"Our guests should experience
an escape from the everyday."</i>

1411
01:16:53,076 --> 01:16:57,410
"And that's what I'd like
to capture in our new hotel."

1412
01:17:01,952 --> 01:17:06,514
<i>"What every kid knows and what
every adult has forgotten."</i>

1413
01:17:13,230 --> 01:17:16,165
"Like my father said to me,

1414
01:17:16,233 --> 01:17:20,670
your fun is only limited
by your imagination."

1415
01:17:23,707 --> 01:17:26,574
- That was beautiful.
- Yeah? All right. Settle down.

1416
01:17:26,643 --> 01:17:28,076
Just the way it built.

1417
01:17:28,144 --> 01:17:32,080
And that's it? I'm sorry.
I don't understand it.

1418
01:17:34,384 --> 01:17:37,615
That... was... brilliant!

1419
01:17:37,687 --> 01:17:40,918
<i>Congratulations, my boy. You've
just won the keys to the kingdom.</i>

1420
01:17:53,770 --> 01:17:57,501
Boogie, don't do that. Germs.

1421
01:18:00,143 --> 01:18:02,941
Congratulations. Great
job. Keep icing that tongue.

1422
01:18:03,013 --> 01:18:05,447
- All right.
- Congratulations, Skeeter.

1423
01:18:05,515 --> 01:18:07,449
- Congratulations. That was great.
- Yeah?

1424
01:18:09,719 --> 01:18:11,050
That's just terrific.

1425
01:18:12,188 --> 01:18:13,553
Congratulations, Skeeter.

1426
01:18:13,623 --> 01:18:16,820
All right, Kendall. Yeah.
No hard feelings, pal.

1427
01:18:16,893 --> 01:18:19,885
Of course not. You deserve it.
You're a better man than me.

1428
01:18:19,963 --> 01:18:22,431
<i>- You have an iron will.
- Yeah. That's what they say.</i>

1429
01:18:22,499 --> 01:18:25,991
<i>I would not have the guts to tear down
the school my niece and nephew attend.</i>

1430
01:18:26,069 --> 01:18:28,037
What?

1431
01:18:29,472 --> 01:18:32,168
You do know that's the
site for the new hotel?

1432
01:18:32,242 --> 01:18:34,142
What are you talking about?

1433
01:18:34,210 --> 01:18:36,440
- Good show, old son.
- Oh, sir.

1434
01:18:36,513 --> 01:18:40,711
<i>That bee sting language was really
working for you on a sympathetic level.</i>

1435
01:18:40,784 --> 01:18:43,412
Good, I'm glad. I wanted to
talk to you about the location

1436
01:18:43,486 --> 01:18:44,919
that we're building the hotel.

1437
01:18:44,988 --> 01:18:47,149
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

1438
01:18:47,223 --> 01:18:50,454
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

1439
01:18:50,527 --> 01:18:53,519
<i>Happy birthday</i>

1440
01:19:15,385 --> 01:19:18,548
Bronson, you're fired!

1441
01:19:19,923 --> 01:19:22,289
Fired?

1442
01:19:22,359 --> 01:19:23,519
Oh...

1443
01:19:23,593 --> 01:19:25,618
That's how it connects.

1444
01:19:36,873 --> 01:19:37,897
Yes?

1445
01:19:37,974 --> 01:19:39,874
Do you know where Jill
Hastings' class is?

1446
01:19:39,943 --> 01:19:41,274
<i>It's right over there.</i>

1447
01:19:43,279 --> 01:19:45,679
Why won't you answer my calls?

1448
01:19:45,749 --> 01:19:48,217
Because I know it's you calling.

1449
01:19:48,284 --> 01:19:50,548
<i>You got to believe me,
Jill. I had no idea...</i>

1450
01:19:50,620 --> 01:19:55,080
<i>Don't destroy the sliver of respect
I have for you by making lame excuses.</i>

1451
01:19:56,426 --> 01:20:00,556
Just go away and stay away.

1452
01:20:02,632 --> 01:20:06,068
Uncle Skeeter? Do you want
to incinertate our school

1453
01:20:06,136 --> 01:20:08,934
'cause we incinertated you in the story?

1454
01:20:09,005 --> 01:20:11,269
No, I wouldn't do that.

1455
01:20:11,341 --> 01:20:14,139
We thought you were
supposed to be the good guy.

1456
01:20:28,091 --> 01:20:29,422
So did I.

1457
01:20:48,711 --> 01:20:51,544
"Skeeto defeats Kendallo."

1458
01:20:52,916 --> 01:20:54,850
Not really.

1459
01:20:54,918 --> 01:20:58,979
- Yeah?
- Hey.

1460
01:20:59,055 --> 01:21:01,956
Oh, hey. Welcome back.

1461
01:21:03,526 --> 01:21:05,255
So, you mad at me, too?

1462
01:21:05,328 --> 01:21:09,162
Not as mad as Jill, but, uh, mad, yes.

1463
01:21:09,232 --> 01:21:11,860
I didn't know the new
hotel was going up there.

1464
01:21:12,602 --> 01:21:13,762
I figured that.

1465
01:21:13,837 --> 01:21:14,929
Then what are you mad at?

1466
01:21:15,004 --> 01:21:16,528
<i>I gave the kids junk food?</i>

1467
01:21:16,606 --> 01:21:18,801
No, I figured you'd do that too.

1468
01:21:18,875 --> 01:21:22,003
I'm mad because you told my kids

1469
01:21:22,078 --> 01:21:24,410
that in real life there
are no happy endings.

1470
01:21:24,481 --> 01:21:26,415
Well, look around you, Wendy.

1471
01:21:26,483 --> 01:21:28,610
Do you see any happy endings here?

1472
01:21:30,920 --> 01:21:36,324
I don't know. You and Dad always
had so much fun in this room.

1473
01:21:36,392 --> 01:21:38,053
<i>For whatever reason, I didn't.</i>

1474
01:21:38,127 --> 01:21:41,187
I was always the cynic,
the, the sourpuss.

1475
01:21:41,264 --> 01:21:44,062
The black cloud. The energy drainer.

1476
01:21:44,133 --> 01:21:46,260
The... dead fish.

1477
01:21:46,336 --> 01:21:48,964
Yes, all of those things.

1478
01:21:49,038 --> 01:21:51,063
But when I left Bobbi
and Patrick with you,

1479
01:21:51,140 --> 01:21:54,268
I guess I just was hoping
you'd rub off on them.

1480
01:21:54,344 --> 01:21:58,542
<i>Get them to be lighter.
Have fun. Enjoy themselves.</i>

1481
01:21:59,616 --> 01:22:01,140
I thought Dad would like that.

1482
01:22:02,652 --> 01:22:05,849
Anyway, um, I got a job in Arizona.

1483
01:22:05,922 --> 01:22:08,152
Teaching, not principaling.

1484
01:22:08,224 --> 01:22:09,691
That's cool.

1485
01:22:09,759 --> 01:22:12,853
<i>Yeah, well, maybe you can
come visit when we get settled.</i>

1486
01:22:12,929 --> 01:22:15,591
I know by then the kids
will really want to see you.

1487
01:22:22,238 --> 01:22:23,705
<i>All right. Love you.</i>

1488
01:22:23,773 --> 01:22:25,104
<i>Love you.</i>

1489
01:22:29,879 --> 01:22:34,748
<i>And so Skeeter sat on his
bed, filled with regret,</i>

1490
01:22:34,817 --> 01:22:37,183
<i>wondering how to put the
pieces of his life together</i>

1491
01:22:37,253 --> 01:22:39,278
<i>after one magical week.</i>

1492
01:22:39,355 --> 01:22:43,052
<i>- Great ending, huh?
- That was your ending, son?</i>

1493
01:22:43,126 --> 01:22:46,357
<i>I thought this was just a sad part,
and you were about to make it better.</i>

1494
01:22:46,429 --> 01:22:48,260
What? How could I make it any better?

1495
01:22:48,331 --> 01:22:50,822
<i>Well, In the stories I told you,</i>

1496
01:22:50,900 --> 01:22:52,731
<i>just when things looked bleakest,</i>

1497
01:22:52,802 --> 01:22:56,363
<i>the hero would do something
unexpected and courageous</i>

1498
01:22:56,439 --> 01:22:59,237
<i>to beat the bad guy, save
the day, and get the girl!</i>

1499
01:23:00,310 --> 01:23:02,335
Yeah. How can I do that?

1500
01:23:02,412 --> 01:23:04,004
<i>It's your story, not mine.</i>

1501
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:06,207
<i>But you better get
moving. Go get 'em, son.</i>

1502
01:23:17,193 --> 01:23:19,354
Mr. Nottingham! Mr. Nottingham?

1503
01:23:19,429 --> 01:23:21,954
I was wondering if I could
talk to you for a moment.

1504
01:23:22,031 --> 01:23:25,228
My name is Jill Hastings. I'm
a teacher at Webster Elementary.

1505
01:23:25,301 --> 01:23:28,828
<i>Save our school! Save our school!</i>

1506
01:23:28,905 --> 01:23:32,363
<i>Save our school! Save our school!</i>

1507
01:23:32,442 --> 01:23:34,137
<i>Save our school!</i>

1508
01:23:34,210 --> 01:23:35,905
<i>Save our school!</i>

1509
01:23:35,979 --> 01:23:39,073
My men are in position. We
are ready for the demolition.

1510
01:23:39,148 --> 01:23:41,309
Excellent. Mr. Nottingham said he'd call

1511
01:23:41,384 --> 01:23:43,477
<i>if he had a problem
getting the variance,</i>

1512
01:23:43,553 --> 01:23:46,113
so if we don't hear from
him in the next 20 minutes,

1513
01:23:46,189 --> 01:23:48,214
I say we just... blow it all up.

1514
01:23:54,297 --> 01:23:57,824
<i>Madam, the war is over.
You lost. I'm sorry.</i>

1515
01:24:01,504 --> 01:24:04,735
This isn't a war, Mr. Nottingham.
We're talking about children.

1516
01:24:04,807 --> 01:24:07,833
There must be other possible
sites for your hotel complex

1517
01:24:07,910 --> 01:24:10,435
that would not result
in the displacement...

1518
01:24:10,513 --> 01:24:12,413
Hey, hey! Barry, Jill. How you doing?

1519
01:24:12,482 --> 01:24:15,383
We're just wrapping up here.
Donna, you remember Jill, right?

1520
01:24:15,451 --> 01:24:19,649
Of course! Oh, my God.
That jacket is so cute!

1521
01:24:19,722 --> 01:24:22,555
Uh, thank you.

1522
01:24:22,625 --> 01:24:24,115
Bronson, what are you doing here?

1523
01:24:24,193 --> 01:24:26,627
What am I doing here?
Yeah, what am I doing here?

1524
01:24:26,696 --> 01:24:30,530
Oh, uh, well, Mr. Bronson,
as a concerned citizen,

1525
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:32,329
wanted to bring points to my attention

1526
01:24:32,402 --> 01:24:35,030
before I made any hasty
decisions about the property.

1527
01:24:35,104 --> 01:24:38,471
And they are points that are
going to take me years to analyze.

1528
01:24:38,541 --> 01:24:40,702
- Years?
- Years.

1529
01:24:40,777 --> 01:24:44,304
Bronson, are you
playing hardball with me?

1530
01:24:44,380 --> 01:24:45,745
I am, sir.

1531
01:24:45,815 --> 01:24:49,046
<i>Because your application
for variance has been...</i>

1532
01:24:50,420 --> 01:24:52,149
Denied.

1533
01:24:53,723 --> 01:24:55,020
Denied?

1534
01:24:55,091 --> 01:24:56,956
Yes. But the good news is

1535
01:24:57,026 --> 01:24:59,460
Donna and I found you
another piece of property

1536
01:24:59,529 --> 01:25:03,397
right on the beach in Santa Monica
that is uptight and out of sight.

1537
01:25:03,466 --> 01:25:06,026
Beachfront was my first
choice, but it's not for sale.

1538
01:25:06,102 --> 01:25:07,569
It is now.

1539
01:25:07,637 --> 01:25:09,867
It is! Isn't that fabulous?

1540
01:25:10,373 --> 01:25:11,465
Really?

1541
01:25:11,541 --> 01:25:12,974
Friends?

1542
01:25:13,042 --> 01:25:15,033
Oh, oh. Yeah, well, germs.

1543
01:25:15,111 --> 01:25:18,638
Let's get past that.
Come here. Come here.

1544
01:25:18,715 --> 01:25:22,082
No, no, no, no, no.

1545
01:25:22,151 --> 01:25:24,984
I'm touching you, and
it's OK. Look at that.

1546
01:25:25,054 --> 01:25:27,147
Aw...

1547
01:25:27,223 --> 01:25:31,057
Ooh. You're enjoying it.
Good. Bring me closer.

1548
01:25:31,127 --> 01:25:34,824
That is so sweet. And creepy.

1549
01:25:37,967 --> 01:25:40,026
Attention, please, ladies and gentlemen.

1550
01:25:40,103 --> 01:25:44,472
<i>We are working with highly-sensitive,
dangerous radio-controlled explosives.</i>

1551
01:25:44,540 --> 01:25:46,269
Boo!

1552
01:25:46,342 --> 01:25:50,278
<i>And so to avoid any tragic misfires,</i>

1553
01:25:50,346 --> 01:25:52,814
I would ask that you all
turn off your cell phones.

1554
01:25:52,882 --> 01:25:56,113
All of you, please. Turn
your cell phones off.

1555
01:25:57,720 --> 01:25:59,779
<i>Did you really just fix everything?</i>

1556
01:25:59,856 --> 01:26:01,790
<i>Not everything.</i>

1557
01:26:05,328 --> 01:26:07,523
<i>- Yes?
- We appear to have a situation.</i>

1558
01:26:07,597 --> 01:26:09,565
I can't reach Kendall on his cell phone

1559
01:26:09,632 --> 01:26:13,432
to halt the demolition which
will begin in... 13 minutes.

1560
01:26:13,503 --> 01:26:15,403
This sign we made is awesome!

1561
01:26:15,471 --> 01:26:18,531
We need a window where those
construction guys can see it.

1562
01:26:18,608 --> 01:26:20,473
Then they'll change their minds.

1563
01:26:22,044 --> 01:26:23,705
Bobbi, I found one.

1564
01:26:27,950 --> 01:26:29,815
That's my Prius!

1565
01:26:29,886 --> 01:26:31,683
- OK. Where's your truck?
- My truck?

1566
01:26:31,754 --> 01:26:33,813
<i>I had to give it back to the hotel.</i>

1567
01:26:33,890 --> 01:26:36,484
<i>What do you mean you
gave it back to the hotel?</i>

1568
01:26:36,559 --> 01:26:37,890
Come here! Come here!

1569
01:26:37,960 --> 01:26:40,292
<i>Sorry!</i>

1570
01:26:41,731 --> 01:26:43,596
It's for a good cause!

1571
01:26:46,435 --> 01:26:48,767
<i>Have you ever driven a motorcycle?</i>

1572
01:26:48,838 --> 01:26:50,169
No!

1573
01:27:21,337 --> 01:27:23,032
Oh, my God!

1574
01:27:26,709 --> 01:27:28,643
No, no, no, no!

1575
01:27:33,616 --> 01:27:35,208
Ooh! Yah! Booya!

1576
01:27:46,128 --> 01:27:49,359
<i>Have you seen Bobbi? Patrick?</i>

1577
01:27:49,432 --> 01:27:51,798
Bobbi! Patrick!

1578
01:27:53,836 --> 01:27:55,565
What are you going to do?

1579
01:28:14,557 --> 01:28:16,252
I'll take that back.

1580
01:28:18,060 --> 01:28:20,085
No fair!

1581
01:28:20,162 --> 01:28:23,598
Hey, people, that's
60 seconds! Whoo-hoo!

1582
01:28:23,666 --> 01:28:26,567
Wait! Wait a minute! I
can't find my children!

1583
01:28:26,636 --> 01:28:28,763
- They might be in there!
- Nice try.

1584
01:28:28,838 --> 01:28:31,671
<i>We cleared the building hours
ago. OK? Everything is fine.</i>

1585
01:28:33,976 --> 01:28:35,773
No! Let me through!

1586
01:28:35,845 --> 01:28:38,837
Hey, we got to check the rooms
before we start making booms.

1587
01:28:38,915 --> 01:28:40,712
<i>We've checked it already!</i>

1588
01:28:40,783 --> 01:28:42,011
Do it myself.

1589
01:28:43,419 --> 01:28:46,081
Uncle Skeeter!

1590
01:28:46,155 --> 01:28:48,623
Hey! Get out of there!

1591
01:28:48,691 --> 01:28:50,090
<i>- Five...
- No!</i>

1592
01:28:50,159 --> 01:28:51,683
- Grab the bar!
- Four...

1593
01:28:52,929 --> 01:28:54,897
Three...

1594
01:28:55,531 --> 01:28:57,123
Two...

1595
01:28:57,199 --> 01:28:58,188
One!

1596
01:29:04,941 --> 01:29:07,876
The king has issued a proclamation.

1597
01:29:08,878 --> 01:29:10,971
<i>The hotel moves away.</i>

1598
01:29:11,047 --> 01:29:13,447
The school will stay.

1599
01:29:13,516 --> 01:29:15,746
<i>Long live Webster Elementary!</i>

1600
01:29:21,090 --> 01:29:22,250
- Mom!
- Mom!

1601
01:29:22,325 --> 01:29:23,883
Bobbi! Patrick!

1602
01:29:25,161 --> 01:29:26,355
Oh!

1603
01:29:28,864 --> 01:29:32,664
Hey, hey, hey. You
guys underdemeciated me.

1604
01:29:32,735 --> 01:29:35,363
Come here! I just got to know you guys.

1605
01:29:35,438 --> 01:29:37,906
You think I'm gonna let
you slip away from me now?

1606
01:29:37,974 --> 01:29:40,602
I knew you were the good guy.

1607
01:29:40,676 --> 01:29:42,075
Yeah.

1608
01:29:42,144 --> 01:29:46,171
Uh, Patrick, hi. I'm Trisha Sparks.

1609
01:29:46,248 --> 01:29:49,547
<i>I just wanted you to know that...
thanks for saving the school.</i>

1610
01:29:51,587 --> 01:29:53,282
Western. Go Western.

1611
01:29:53,356 --> 01:29:58,020
- No thanks necessary, ma'am.
- That's my boy. That's my boy.

1612
01:29:58,094 --> 01:30:02,190
There must be some way for
me to show my appreciation.

1613
01:30:02,264 --> 01:30:07,964
Oh-ho-ho!
Get it.

1614
01:30:09,105 --> 01:30:13,098
Ooh!
Hoo-hoo-hoo!

1615
01:30:13,175 --> 01:30:14,836
Hey, isn't she a little old for you?

1616
01:30:14,910 --> 01:30:17,879
- She's hot.
- So is she. What do you think?

1617
01:30:17,947 --> 01:30:19,744
If Master Stinky's getting a kiss,

1618
01:30:19,815 --> 01:30:22,943
shouldn't, shouldn't I get
a little mermaid action?

1619
01:30:23,019 --> 01:30:25,078
- Come on, already.
- Ooh!

1620
01:30:39,435 --> 01:30:42,029
<i>Now look what my boy has done.</i>

1621
01:30:42,104 --> 01:30:44,937
<i>Turned his back on the world
of luxury hotel management</i>

1622
01:30:45,007 --> 01:30:47,999
<i>to start a small family business.</i>

1623
01:30:48,077 --> 01:30:52,241
<i>And bless his heart, he
even named it after me.</i>

1624
01:30:52,314 --> 01:30:55,613
Hey, speaking of s'mores, it
looks like Bugsy ate them all.

1625
01:30:57,653 --> 01:30:59,518
We're completely out of marshmallows.

1626
01:30:59,588 --> 01:31:02,955
Oh, all right. Let me
handle that. Room service!

1627
01:31:05,061 --> 01:31:07,086
- Yes, sir?
- Hi, Kendall.

1628
01:31:07,163 --> 01:31:08,687
Uh, Bugsy's out of marshmallows.

1629
01:31:08,764 --> 01:31:11,324
If you could just go get him
some, that would be great.

1630
01:31:11,400 --> 01:31:12,992
Right on it, sir. Anything else?

1631
01:31:13,069 --> 01:31:15,162
Uh, not from you, Kendall, but, uh...

1632
01:31:15,237 --> 01:31:16,898
...Housekeeping?

1633
01:31:18,240 --> 01:31:19,867
Hey, Aspen.

1634
01:31:19,942 --> 01:31:22,308
Could you just make sure
that Bugsy's cage is clean

1635
01:31:22,378 --> 01:31:23,970
before he checks out in the morning?

1636
01:31:24,046 --> 01:31:26,913
His marshmallows don't agree
with him, there's gonna be a mess.

1637
01:31:30,486 --> 01:31:31,748
All right.

1638
01:31:33,255 --> 01:31:34,586
OK, bye, guys.

1639
01:31:34,657 --> 01:31:36,989
<i>I think Bugsy is trying to tell us</i>

1640
01:31:37,059 --> 01:31:39,027
<i>that our tale has reached its end.</i>

1641
01:31:39,095 --> 01:31:40,824
<i>But before I go, let me tell you</i>

1642
01:31:40,896 --> 01:31:43,296
<i>what our heroes and
villains are doing now.</i>

1643
01:31:43,365 --> 01:31:45,265
<i>My old friend, Barry Nottingham,</i>

1644
01:31:45,334 --> 01:31:47,894
<i>overcame his fear of
germs to such a degree</i>

1645
01:31:47,970 --> 01:31:50,302
<i>that he decided to
leave the hotel business</i>

1646
01:31:50,372 --> 01:31:52,966
<i>and enter the field of medicine.</i>

1647
01:31:53,042 --> 01:31:57,342
<i>He is currently the school
nurse at Webster Elementary.</i>

1648
01:31:57,413 --> 01:31:59,677
<i>Violet now runs the hotel empire,</i>

1649
01:31:59,748 --> 01:32:02,148
<i>along with her husband, Mickey,</i>

1650
01:32:02,218 --> 01:32:04,277
<i>the former room service waiter</i>

1651
01:32:04,353 --> 01:32:07,186
<i>who is now the ninth-richest
person in the world.</i>

1652
01:32:08,324 --> 01:32:10,258
<i>And Skeeter and Jill?</i>

1653
01:32:10,326 --> 01:32:13,762
<i>After the double wedding of the century,</i>

1654
01:32:13,829 --> 01:32:18,459
<i>they lived... well, happily ever after,</i>

1655
01:32:18,534 --> 01:32:20,297
<i>running Marty's Motel</i>

1656
01:32:20,369 --> 01:32:23,600
<i>and spending a lot of
time with my grandkids,</i>

1657
01:32:23,672 --> 01:32:26,436
<i>whose adventures have just begun.</i>

1658
01:32:26,509 --> 01:32:30,536
<i>Though, not everyone
is quite so excited.</i>

1659
01:32:30,613 --> 01:32:33,411
<i>But that is a whole other story.</i>

1660
01:32:33,482 --> 01:32:35,279
<i>The end.</i>

1661
01:32:37,753 --> 01:32:39,983
<i>Don't stop believing</i>

1662
01:32:41,290 --> 01:32:44,418
<i>Hold on to that feeling</i>

1663
01:32:44,493 --> 01:32:47,758
<i>Streetlight people</i>

1664
01:32:47,830 --> 01:32:52,426
<i>Oh-oh-whoa</i>

1665
01:32:52,501 --> 01:32:56,369
<i>Don't stop believing</i>

1666
01:32:56,438 --> 01:32:59,930
<i>Hold on</i>

1667
01:33:00,009 --> 01:33:03,604
<i>Streetlight people</i>

1668
01:33:03,679 --> 01:33:08,275
<i>Oh-oh-whoa</i>

1669
01:33:26,202 --> 01:33:28,432
<i>Just a small town girl</i>

1670
01:33:29,738 --> 01:33:32,935
<i>Livin' in a lonely world</i>

1671
01:33:34,109 --> 01:33:36,202
<i>She took the midnight train</i>

1672
01:33:36,278 --> 01:33:39,714
<i>Goin' anywhere</i>

1673
01:33:42,318 --> 01:33:44,912
<i>Just a city boy</i>

1674
01:33:46,422 --> 01:33:49,357
<i>Born and raised in south Detroit</i>

1675
01:33:50,659 --> 01:33:52,559
<i>He took the midnight train</i>

1676
01:33:52,628 --> 01:33:56,564
<i>Goin' anywhere</i>

1677
01:34:14,583 --> 01:34:17,347
<i>A singer in a smoky room</i>

1678
01:34:18,854 --> 01:34:22,346
<i>A smell of wine and cheap perfume</i>

1679
01:34:22,424 --> 01:34:25,257
<i>For a smile they can share the night</i>

1680
01:34:25,327 --> 01:34:29,787
<i>It goes on and on and on and on</i>

1681
01:34:29,865 --> 01:34:33,961
<i>Strangers waiting</i>

1682
01:34:35,037 --> 01:34:37,505
<i>Up and down the boulevard</i>

1683
01:34:37,573 --> 01:34:39,905
<i>Their shadows</i>

1684
01:34:39,975 --> 01:34:44,241
<i>Searching in the night</i>

1685
01:34:46,248 --> 01:34:49,945
<i>Streetlight people</i>

1686
01:34:51,420 --> 01:34:54,253
<i>Living just to find emotion</i>

1687
01:34:54,323 --> 01:34:55,984
<i>Hiding</i>

1688
01:34:56,058 --> 01:35:00,825
<i>Somewhere in the night</i>

1689
01:35:10,873 --> 01:35:13,865
<i>Working hard to get my fill</i>

1690
01:35:14,910 --> 01:35:18,744
<i>Everybody wants a thrill</i>

1691
01:35:18,814 --> 01:35:21,806
<i>Paying anything to roll the dice</i>

1692
01:35:21,884 --> 01:35:25,684
<i>Just one more time</i>

1693
01:35:26,689 --> 01:35:28,418
<i>Some will win</i>

1694
01:35:28,490 --> 01:35:30,720
