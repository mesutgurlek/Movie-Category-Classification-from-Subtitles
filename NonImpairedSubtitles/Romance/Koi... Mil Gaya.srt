1
00:01:59,853 --> 00:02:03,687
The universe is made of
several groups of stars...

2
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,621
which are called the galaxies.

3
00:02:06,826 --> 00:02:08,487
The galaxy our planet Earth belongs to

4
00:02:09,395 --> 00:02:13,058
is called the Milky Way.

5
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:17,570
My husband, who was a space scientist
firmly believed...

6
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:21,471
that like the Milky Way, there
exist several other galaxies...

7
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:25,405
on which there could be life.

8
00:02:26,212 --> 00:02:30,740
He had just one goal in life:
To discover life on other planets.

9
00:02:32,118 --> 00:02:38,785
He had invented several types of
gadgets to collect data.

10
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:42,119
He used to send sound signals
into space...

11
00:02:42,862 --> 00:02:45,296
and always said that a sound
is something that never dies.

12
00:02:46,032 --> 00:02:49,024
That it reverberates in space forever.

13
00:02:50,537 --> 00:02:51,333
He was sure that some day...

14
00:02:51,938 --> 00:02:57,467
someone from another world would
listen to his sound signals...

15
00:02:58,044 --> 00:02:59,238
and respond.

16
00:03:00,813 --> 00:03:01,404
One evening...

17
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:13,078
Sonia!

18
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:22,262
Coming, dear. What happened?

19
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,992
Look! They're responding!

20
00:04:29,302 --> 00:04:32,203
These sounds...?

21
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:36,468
I used the word "OM" to make a
pattern on this octopad.

22
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:43,306
I converted it digitally on the computer
to send sound bytes into space.

23
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:47,885
And look at this. Someone from
another world is responding to me.

24
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:48,880
I've succeeded in my research!

25
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:51,755
I've achieved a breakthrough, Sonia!

26
00:04:52,358 --> 00:04:54,519
We must inform the
space centre immediately.

27
00:05:10,276 --> 00:05:13,074
You see this Research Centre, Dr Mehra?

28
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,143
This is what we have been
researching for years...

29
00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:20,444
and they contacted you of all the people?
How is that possible?

30
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,886
Why not? I too have spent a
lifetime doing this research.

31
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:26,891
I sent them various sound waves...

32
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,887
I invented so many sound
producing instruments

33
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:34,258
And after all my experiments,
when I sent the word "OM" to them...

34
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:38,760
in different variations and notes,
why isn't it possible that...

35
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:16,864
I must go home, to bed.

36
00:06:17,443 --> 00:06:21,607
They don't realise that every discovery
or find is initially a dream.

37
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,515
Don't be disheartened.

38
00:06:28,354 --> 00:06:30,288
People in the world always
reject new findings...

39
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:34,919
but accept them later.
That's what they're doing to us.

40
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:41,894
Is it possible for the worlds
in the universe...

41
00:06:43,936 --> 00:06:45,870
separated by millions of miles...

42
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:50,005
to ever meet? - Why not?

43
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:55,305
Man has gone to the Moon. He has sent
space-shuttles to Mars and Jupiter.

44
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:58,775
Similarly, they must be trying
to find out about our world too.

45
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:02,852
Which is why UFO's
have often been sighted.

46
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:11,661
Why are the lights
going on and off?

47
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:16,829
What's happening?

48
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:26,737
Sanjay! Look there!

49
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:42,552
They didn't believe what I said.
But they've come!

50
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:08,385
No...

51
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:15,821
In a single moment, every dream
of our life was shattered.

52
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:19,688
The one who tried to
locate another world...

53
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,165
was lost to a world
no one knows about.

54
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:28,640
After his death, I had
no other support in Canada.

55
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:34,379
Rohit was very small,
so I came back home.

56
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:41,049
From what you say, I now understand
the whole case history.

57
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,512
These are the x-rays
of Rohit's brain.

58
00:08:45,491 --> 00:08:49,894
See this white patch?
It's called the gliosys.

59
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,897
It's caused by an injury
to the brain.

60
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:59,902
But nothing of the sort
ever happened to Rohit, Doctor.

61
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:05,107
It did, Mrs Mehra, when you fell on
your stomach during the accident...

62
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:07,736
it caused an injury
to the baby's brain...

63
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:12,246
Who was in your womb and
this part of his brain was damaged.

64
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:18,991
That's why he doesn't have a normal
mental growth and is weak in studies.

65
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:24,220
Although he's eight, his brain is
that of a two-and-a-half-year old's.

66
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:29,701
I'm afraid, even when he grows up,
his mental faculties will be stunted.

67
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:39,976
There surely would be a cure, doctor?
- There is. A brain surgery.

68
00:09:41,447 --> 00:09:44,314
However... - What?

69
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:48,712
Chances of success in this case
are very bleak.

70
00:09:50,122 --> 00:09:52,955
If the surgery fails, his whole
body could be paralyzed.

71
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:57,021
Or it could even result in death.

72
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:03,994
No. I've already lost
everything I ever had.

73
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:09,400
I have nothing except Rohit.

74
00:10:12,144 --> 00:10:13,133
I can't afford to lose him.

75
00:10:21,587 --> 00:10:25,990
"Although he's eight, his brain is
that of a two-and-a-half-year old's".

76
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:30,255
"Even when he grows up, his mental
faculties will be stunted".

77
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:03,856
Sorry, my foot! Look at what you've
done to my house with that ball of yours.

78
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:06,997
I'm in the police force.
If you break another window pane...

79
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:08,825
I'll have you locked up.
Get that?

80
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:11,897
Argues with me.
Bloody crooks.

81
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:25,209
What harm have I done to you?
You've broken a window pane again!

82
00:11:25,584 --> 00:11:27,245
I break your window pane.
But I do say sorry, don't I?

83
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:32,488
Are you doing me a favour?
How many years have I put up with you!

84
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:35,490
I'm not sparing you today. I'm not!

85
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:38,453
No one needs to be scared.
- Oh yes, let him come.

86
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:48,172
God! What have they done! They've
wrecked all the window panes!

87
00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:51,968
The rain, the sunshine, the dust...

88
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:53,542
everything's in there, except me!

89
00:11:53,913 --> 00:11:54,709
Don't get angry uncle.

90
00:11:55,347 --> 00:11:58,043
When I grow up, I'll mend
all your windows Uncle.

91
00:11:58,818 --> 00:12:03,050
How much more do you want to grow up?
You're as tall as a tree already.

92
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:06,789
You want to be the Eiffel Tower?
- Don't insult our friend.

93
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:10,522
We'll replace all your window panes.
- Go ahead and do it!

94
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:13,999
Let's have five hundred bucks first.
- Five hundred bucks? What for?

95
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:18,669
We'll have to buy new ones, you see.
So let's have the money.

96
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:20,997
Rascals! You ask a
policeman for money?

97
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,674
Get going before I give
you a thrashing! Scram!

98
00:12:26,378 --> 00:12:29,347
Rohit, hurry up son.
You'll be late for school

99
00:12:30,382 --> 00:12:33,613
Today's a very important day, Lord.
I'm going to a higher class.

100
00:12:34,286 --> 00:12:38,848
The seventh standard.
Take care of me, Lord.

101
00:12:42,294 --> 00:12:44,285
Ma, have you never been to school?

102
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:47,522
We don't carry old books to a new class.

103
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:50,227
I'll be given new books
in the seventh standard.

104
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:53,666
You're not going to
the seventh standard.

105
00:12:54,406 --> 00:12:56,033
Why not? All my friends are!

106
00:12:59,745 --> 00:13:00,336
You've failed your grades.

107
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:06,213
I've failed again?

108
00:13:08,587 --> 00:13:09,019
Yes.

109
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,020
I'm not going to school. Never!

110
00:13:13,692 --> 00:13:18,061
That teacher's a nasty man.
I do all my studies, he still fails me.

111
00:13:18,497 --> 00:13:23,992
And he promotes everyone else.
That's why I will not go to school.

112
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,575
Study harder this time, Rohit.
You will surely pass.

113
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:31,342
No.

114
00:13:33,245 --> 00:13:35,042
There will be new students
in my class, Ma.

115
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:38,206
They'll tease me and make fun of me.

116
00:13:38,617 --> 00:13:41,814
They'll call me a tall stick and
other things. I'm not going to school.

117
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:43,946
Throw those books away.
I don't want them.

118
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:51,724
It is not possible, Mrs Mehra.

119
00:13:53,265 --> 00:13:55,859
Forget about promoting Rohit
to the seventh standard...

120
00:13:56,735 --> 00:13:58,327
he shouldn't be in this school
in the first place.

121
00:13:59,638 --> 00:14:02,163
There are special schools
for children like him.

122
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:04,799
There is no school like that
in this town.

123
00:14:06,745 --> 00:14:11,648
But I'm trying to get
a transfer to Delhi...

124
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:15,045
where there are special schools
for children like Rohit.

125
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:21,253
The chairman of the bank I'm working
for has even promised me a transfer.

126
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:26,398
It's only a matter of a year, sir.

127
00:14:30,502 --> 00:14:32,265
One last favour, sir.

128
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:34,797
Teachers never consider educating
children a favour.

129
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:42,972
But giving him a promotion like this
won't help him in any way.

130
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:49,446
Father, I know Rohit will never
become what I wanted him to be...

131
00:14:52,424 --> 00:14:53,789
nor what his father wished for him.

132
00:14:57,062 --> 00:15:00,225
But still, for the sake
of Rohit's happiness...

133
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:04,731
please, I request...

134
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:13,708
This is the last time.

135
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:22,650
If x is equal to 12,
and y is equal to 8...

136
00:15:23,622 --> 00:15:27,023
what would x plus 3y be?
Hurry up and write down the answer.

137
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:42,201
How much would x plus 3y be?
Show me your answer.

138
00:15:59,491 --> 00:16:00,389
This is the right answer.

139
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:06,593
Yours ought to be the first hand to
rise in the class next time.

140
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:42,934
"The sight of the birds..."

141
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:47,929
"awakens a desire"

142
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:53,408
"Although we tread the earth..."

143
00:16:53,812 --> 00:16:58,613
"we will reach for the skies"

144
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:14,125
"Can you tell me how we will
fly so high, without any wings?"

145
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:20,158
"Anything is possible,
anything can happen..."

146
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:25,469
"we aren't so naive"

147
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:26,323
"You will see,
there will come a day..."

148
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:31,399
"a day like that
will surely come..."

149
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:42,075
"when everyone in the world
will want to shake hands with me"

150
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:17,974
"Happiness will embrace you"

151
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:23,151
"Life will change some day"

152
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:28,357
"The skies will bow
at your feet..."

153
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:33,531
"and there will be
no one like you around"

154
00:20:44,376 --> 00:20:48,870
"The sight of the birds..."

155
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:53,751
"awakens a desire"

156
00:20:54,953 --> 00:20:59,481
"Although we tread the earth..."

157
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:04,524
"we will reach for the skies"

158
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:12,369
"We will reach for the skies"

159
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:52,940
What are you shaking your head for?
You're all of six feet...

160
00:21:53,512 --> 00:21:55,241
and you move around with these
two feet nothings. Aren't you ashamed?

161
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:56,579
Get out of our way.

162
00:21:59,518 --> 00:22:02,112
We got here first,
so we'll cross first.

163
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:03,852
Get your bikes out of our way.

164
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:06,019
We do not believe in going in
the backward direction, moron.

165
00:22:06,258 --> 00:22:09,455
We'll do the needful. You will always
keep moving in a backward direction!

166
00:22:12,464 --> 00:22:14,591
He's begun to talk too much, Raj.

167
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:20,195
Rohit, these dogs are barking far too
much today. So let's give them a shot.

168
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:24,008
Oh yes, the formula... - 320!

169
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:38,822
Catch him.

170
00:23:24,302 --> 00:23:24,996
Move... move.

171
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:55,359
May I ask, where you gentlemen
were going to, in such a hurry?

172
00:23:56,134 --> 00:23:59,968
How dare you enter a no-entry zone?
- He knocked our bikes down, sir.

173
00:24:00,338 --> 00:24:02,499
That doesn't mean you will
violate traffic rules.

174
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:06,068
Sukhwani, give them a ticket.

175
00:24:06,578 --> 00:24:09,638
Excuse me, sir.
Perhaps you don't know who I am.

176
00:24:10,182 --> 00:24:15,051
I know. You're Raj, the District
Magistrate Harbans Saxena's son.

177
00:24:15,587 --> 00:24:18,181
Sukhwani, collect double the
fine from them. - Yes sir.

178
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:20,785
And have this news splashed
in the local newspapers.

179
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:25,327
People ought to know that when
Inspector Khan is in-charge...

180
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:30,295
no one can take things for granted.
Not even if he's Distt. Magistrate's son...

181
00:24:30,535 --> 00:24:34,869
or the District Magistrate himself.
I hope you've got the message.

182
00:24:38,743 --> 00:24:40,938
Colonel! Come on out!

183
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:47,079
Harbans! I have never seen
a moron like you!

184
00:24:47,385 --> 00:24:48,579
Couldn't you even
come to receive me?

185
00:24:49,087 --> 00:24:53,854
Malhotra, there can't be a bigger
idiot than you in the world!

186
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:58,092
You sent a fax that you were coming,
but you didn't tell me when and how!

187
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,230
Where would I have come
to receive you, you idiot?

188
00:25:00,699 --> 00:25:03,725
Relax... must you welcome someone
with swear words like this?

189
00:25:03,969 --> 00:25:07,803
But that's how this duffer is!
Look at him! He won't even embrace me.

190
00:25:13,812 --> 00:25:16,975
My dear friend!
So nice to meet you.

191
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:19,050
Now that he has retired...

192
00:25:19,784 --> 00:25:22,116
he has come to spend the rest of
his life with his friend.

193
00:25:22,587 --> 00:25:24,953
And this friendship we will
celebrate for a whole year to come.

194
00:25:25,323 --> 00:25:30,317
To begin with, we'll have a grand
party at our bungalow this evening.

195
00:25:32,664 --> 00:25:35,292
At least come and sit down first.
- Come.

196
00:25:36,801 --> 00:25:41,738
Well, well! I forgot to ask you
the most important question!

197
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:46,008
Where's our little doll...?
Our tiny little girl?

198
00:25:46,745 --> 00:25:50,806
Your tiny little doll has grown up.
- Is it?

199
00:25:52,017 --> 00:25:53,609
But where is she, Indu?

200
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:19,468
Why're you late?
- Not late at all.

201
00:26:19,778 --> 00:26:20,972
The bus has yet to come...

202
00:26:21,212 --> 00:26:23,407
and we'll have a blast watching
the three and half hour movie!

203
00:26:23,848 --> 00:26:27,340
Three and a half hour movie?
- That's the fashion nowadays.

204
00:26:28,486 --> 00:26:29,316
The bus has arrived!

205
00:26:29,854 --> 00:26:33,915
Come quickly... we may miss the bus.
Come quickly.

206
00:26:36,895 --> 00:26:39,420
The bus has left, we miss the movie
and our holiday's in ruins!

207
00:26:48,139 --> 00:26:51,597
I've just arrived in the city.
Can you tell me where Shanti Villa is?

208
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:55,276
Shanti Villa? Over there...
- No, it's on this side!

209
00:26:56,314 --> 00:26:58,407
But... - The jeep's going empty...

210
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:01,619
the girl's gullible,
she'll drop us at the movies.

211
00:27:05,023 --> 00:27:06,684
Let's go. We'll take you there.

212
00:27:20,939 --> 00:27:23,373
By the way, my name is Nisha
What's yours?

213
00:27:29,414 --> 00:27:32,542
What places could one see here?
- Several.

214
00:27:37,956 --> 00:27:40,186
How about the nightlife here?
What do folks do in the nights?

215
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:41,416
They sleep.

216
00:27:47,198 --> 00:27:50,759
Are there no discos in town?
- There are. But kids aren't allowed.

217
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:52,594
Kids?

218
00:28:06,418 --> 00:28:08,943
Hey! This is not Shanti Villa!
- This is a cinema hall.

219
00:28:10,455 --> 00:28:13,618
But I... - You want to go Shanti Villa.

220
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:16,324
And we want go to the movie!

221
00:28:17,662 --> 00:28:20,426
Shanti Villa's not far though,
Take a right, a left...

222
00:28:20,665 --> 00:28:23,930
then right, left, left...
you'll reach Shanti Villa.

223
00:28:25,603 --> 00:28:28,629
So you guys wanted a lift!
- Right, auntie!

224
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:35,104
You ought to be ashamed!
You fool people along with these kids?

225
00:28:36,781 --> 00:28:40,717
And on top of that, you are laughing?
- I'm laughing at your nose.

226
00:28:41,086 --> 00:28:44,715
When you scream, it twitches funnily!
Like a deflated balloon!

227
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:54,126
You shouldn't have done that, Rohit.

228
00:28:54,966 --> 00:28:56,194
When someone asks for your help...

229
00:28:56,501 --> 00:28:59,231
you must help him,
not make a fool out of him.

230
00:29:00,004 --> 00:29:00,698
But I'd have missed the movie.

231
00:29:01,673 --> 00:29:04,267
What did I read out to you
from the Gita?

232
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:11,409
God is forever willing to help those
who help others.

233
00:29:11,983 --> 00:29:16,920
Didn't I read that out to you?
- You did. But I forgot.

234
00:29:19,324 --> 00:29:23,158
The next time you meet that girl,
you're going to apologise to her.

235
00:29:23,962 --> 00:29:26,328
You'll say sorry to her.
- I will.

236
00:29:32,337 --> 00:29:36,740
What's this, Ma?
- It's a computer your Papa made.

237
00:29:37,976 --> 00:29:39,102
Papa built a computer?

238
00:29:41,513 --> 00:29:43,845
Through the computer and
the instruments he invented...

239
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:48,645
he spoke to people who live
far away, on the stars.

240
00:29:50,388 --> 00:29:53,789
There are people on the stars?
- Yes.

241
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:07,797
I can't see anything, Ma.

242
00:30:09,908 --> 00:30:13,605
There are several things
one cannot see.

243
00:30:17,348 --> 00:30:18,110
But they do exist.

244
00:30:25,757 --> 00:30:26,689
What? - Party!

245
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:38,633
Know what, Harbans?
Your jokes are still as hilarious.

246
00:30:39,938 --> 00:30:42,304
Nothing has changed in all these years.
- Why not, daddy?

247
00:30:42,907 --> 00:30:46,138
Look at Raj. He used to be a little
kid, but he's now as tall as a pole.

248
00:30:46,477 --> 00:30:48,206
I'm sure someone pulled his legs!

249
00:30:50,281 --> 00:30:55,184
She used to be small and fat too,
crying, "Mummy!" for everything.

250
00:30:56,821 --> 00:31:00,518
You've met after years and
you've already started fighting?

251
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,760
Fights make the bond of
friendship stronger, Right?

252
00:31:24,916 --> 00:31:32,288
One must eat on time
and sing praises of the Lord!

253
00:31:32,523 --> 00:31:33,455
Give me more.

254
00:31:38,263 --> 00:31:39,287
Their age to eat, all right.

255
00:31:39,931 --> 00:31:42,491
So what's the spread like?
Where are the papad?

256
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:45,460
It's a queue. I'll come
in the line.

257
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:56,208
Is that mutton?
Give me some, I do eat it.

258
00:31:56,447 --> 00:32:00,816
Give us some food.
- You just took a plateful!

259
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:02,677
That's gone down already.
- Where's down?

260
00:32:03,021 --> 00:32:05,956
Here.
- God! Amazing tummy!

261
00:32:06,791 --> 00:32:10,124
300 million people in the country
live under the poverty line.

262
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:12,589
They don't get to see
a fistful of foodgrains...

263
00:32:13,031 --> 00:32:15,829
and you're taking a second helping?
- That's none of your business.

264
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:17,765
Right.

265
00:32:19,137 --> 00:32:19,865
Give us some food.

266
00:32:22,707 --> 00:32:23,833
Bittu! Give me some more!

267
00:32:25,076 --> 00:32:25,667
Wait.

268
00:32:26,844 --> 00:32:27,708
Oh my god! Escape from here.

269
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:30,039
Let the boys continue drinking,
I'm famished.

270
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:36,082
C'mon!

271
00:32:57,942 --> 00:33:02,140
Who does he think he is?
If I could get my hands on him!

272
00:33:04,115 --> 00:33:04,843
I'm not going to spare him!

273
00:33:58,803 --> 00:34:00,430
What are you upto?
What were you stealing?

274
00:34:01,339 --> 00:34:02,601
No... I was only saying sorry.

275
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:05,732
Take a look.
That's his way of saying sorry.

276
00:34:06,477 --> 00:34:08,069
By sticking chewing gum to the seat.

277
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:12,115
So you were sticking
chewing gum, were you?

278
00:34:16,187 --> 00:34:17,279
He's was the one last night!

279
00:34:19,023 --> 00:34:20,957
Jerk, you've started getting
too big for your boots?

280
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:24,551
You challenged us the day other
and you're now teasing girls?

281
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:27,459
He's the one who took me
to a cinema hall...

282
00:34:27,698 --> 00:34:30,496
pretending to show me the house.
He even spilt food on my head!

283
00:34:31,002 --> 00:34:33,129
That was nothing, Nisha. With what
he was doing today...

284
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:35,770
you'd have had to cut your hair!
Look at the chewing gum!

285
00:34:40,845 --> 00:34:43,575
Such a rascal behind
that innocent face?

286
00:34:44,315 --> 00:34:46,579
We ought to hand him over
to the police!

287
00:34:47,952 --> 00:34:51,718
Oh no, why hand him over to the
police for something so trivial?

288
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:55,158
We'll let him go.
What say, Raj?

289
00:34:57,795 --> 00:34:58,227
Scram.

290
00:34:59,797 --> 00:35:00,229
Get lost.

291
00:35:06,204 --> 00:35:09,071
Raj, why're allowing him to leave?
He should be taught a lesson.

292
00:35:31,095 --> 00:35:33,586
Don't hit me! I'm telling you
the truth. I was only saying sorry.

293
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:52,139
Quite a champion with
your scooter, aren't you?

294
00:36:59,116 --> 00:37:01,243
To be honest, that madcap
isn't at fault Nisha.

295
00:37:02,153 --> 00:37:04,087
The sight of you could
drive anyone crazy.

296
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:08,055
Are you flirting with me?

297
00:37:09,527 --> 00:37:12,189
Not at all. On rare occasions,
I speak the truth.

298
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:14,127
He won't get into mischief anymore.

299
00:37:14,665 --> 00:37:16,189
He's been given a solid punishment.

300
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:34,541
But my son isn't like you,
because God hasn't made him like you.

301
00:37:35,853 --> 00:37:40,290
He's a youth, no doubt.
But he has the brains of a child.

302
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:43,492
A naive, innocent child...

303
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:46,790
who can't tell the difference
between good and bad.

304
00:37:49,567 --> 00:37:53,594
You boys beat him up mercilessly
and broke his scooter!

305
00:37:54,739 --> 00:37:56,366
Because you thought he was
teasing this girl?

306
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:00,406
He came here not to tease you
or to harass you...

307
00:38:01,245 --> 00:38:04,237
he came to apologise to you.
Look at this!

308
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:06,079
He wanted to say he was sorry.

309
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:13,022
Anyway, I can't hold this against you
because you are new to this town.

310
00:38:14,859 --> 00:38:17,760
But Raj...?
He knows everything.

311
00:38:18,696 --> 00:38:20,095
He used to be Rohit's class-fellow.

312
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:22,595
Because he's normal...

313
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:26,527
he moved ahead in life.
And my son remained where he was.

314
00:38:27,738 --> 00:38:32,801
But you know something?
I don't regret it at all!

315
00:38:33,878 --> 00:38:35,470
Because if normal people
are like what you are...

316
00:38:36,947 --> 00:38:42,886
I'm glad my son is abnormal.

317
00:39:09,213 --> 00:39:12,478
Rohit, what are you doing
in this computer class?

318
00:39:13,484 --> 00:39:15,179
Rohit has also chosen computers
in his options, sir.

319
00:39:16,654 --> 00:39:17,586
Go and take your seat.

320
00:39:21,058 --> 00:39:22,286
I want to learn computers too, sir.

321
00:39:23,461 --> 00:39:25,793
You need brains to learn computers.

322
00:39:26,263 --> 00:39:30,131
And you're so bright,
you're still in the seventh.

323
00:39:31,001 --> 00:39:33,765
My father was a great scientist, sir.
He even had a computer.

324
00:39:34,939 --> 00:39:38,739
I want to become like my Papa, sir.
- So go and learn from your father.

325
00:39:41,178 --> 00:39:42,270
He's no longer in this world, sir.

326
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:45,615
So go to the world he's in and learn.
And stop picking on my brains!

327
00:39:46,016 --> 00:39:47,347
Go away. Out!

328
00:40:44,642 --> 00:40:45,370
Avon cycle!

329
00:40:47,812 --> 00:40:48,403
Ma...

330
00:40:52,416 --> 00:40:55,510
Is this cycle for me, Ma?
- Yes, it's for you.

331
00:40:57,188 --> 00:41:00,419
It's a very nice bicycle, Ma!
Avon! Thank you, Ma!

332
00:41:01,025 --> 00:41:03,789
Say thank-you to her. She's the
one who brought it for you.

333
00:41:14,872 --> 00:41:16,897
I'm not saying thank-you,
and I'm not saying sorry either.

334
00:41:17,741 --> 00:41:18,435
I don't want the cycle.

335
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:24,111
Have you seen his anger?

336
00:41:39,897 --> 00:41:42,798
It's true I've made a mistake.

337
00:41:44,301 --> 00:41:47,793
But how was I to know that you
weren't upto any mischief...

338
00:41:48,806 --> 00:41:53,140
and had come to say sorry to me?
Anyway, let bygones be bygones.

339
00:41:54,378 --> 00:41:55,470
I'll say sorry to you now, okay?

340
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:08,750
And not just me... Raj, Monty and the
other boys will say sorry to you too.

341
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:11,991
And no one will
bother you ever again.

342
00:42:15,399 --> 00:42:16,229
What if someone does bother me?

343
00:42:17,735 --> 00:42:20,704
You and I will get together
and beat him up!

344
00:42:20,971 --> 00:42:23,166
God! You too?
- Of course.

345
00:42:23,841 --> 00:42:25,536
We're friends now, aren't we?
- Really?

346
00:42:25,776 --> 00:42:26,208
C'mon!

347
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:40,314
All of you will now say
sorry to Rohit.

348
00:42:46,931 --> 00:42:49,729
Didn't I tell you?
Are you happy now?

349
00:42:50,601 --> 00:42:54,162
And listen everybody...
no fights ever again.

350
00:42:54,538 --> 00:42:55,664
Only friendship.

351
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:01,701
Wait here, I'll be back in a minute.

352
00:43:13,857 --> 00:43:17,258
No, I don't know to dance.
- There's nothing you've got to know.

353
00:43:17,728 --> 00:43:20,561
Just hold my body like this
and sway to the music.

354
00:43:21,398 --> 00:43:24,299
No, I feel scared.
- What are you scared of?

355
00:43:24,535 --> 00:43:26,730
I'll teach you.
- No, I don't want to learn.

356
00:43:27,304 --> 00:43:29,067
Hey! You're breaking into a sweat.

357
00:43:31,141 --> 00:43:32,608
Oh yes, a bit of it.

358
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:47,155
It'll rid you of your fear
and you'll stop sweating.

359
00:43:47,391 --> 00:43:49,086
But I'm all right.
- Have some.

360
00:43:52,696 --> 00:43:56,723
It's not nice at all...
- It's very nice. Have it. Go on.

361
00:43:56,967 --> 00:43:58,229
Then, let's dance together.

362
00:44:02,606 --> 00:44:03,800
You're forcing him to have liquor?

363
00:44:04,541 --> 00:44:07,533
What harm will some Bacardi do?
He's not a kid anymore.

364
00:44:08,012 --> 00:44:11,778
I told you not to bother
Rohit anymore. But you guys...

365
00:44:13,584 --> 00:44:13,948
Let's go, Rohit...

366
00:45:00,397 --> 00:45:03,093
"I'm breaking free,
I'm breaking loose..."

367
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:06,298
"who knows where I'm going..."

368
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:16,277
"I'm sliding..."

369
00:45:17,181 --> 00:45:19,775
"what have you done to me?"

370
00:45:34,164 --> 00:45:36,632
"I'm breaking loose,
I'm breaking free..."

371
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:39,896
"who knows where I'm going..."

372
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:49,941
"I'm giving way..."

373
00:45:50,714 --> 00:45:53,342
"I'm moving with you"

374
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:36,384
"What spell is this..."

375
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:45,727
"that we slip, as we walk?"

376
00:46:46,136 --> 00:46:52,075
"We're having so much of fun,
things have changed so much"

377
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:14,055
"Why have things changed?"

378
00:47:14,464 --> 00:47:17,058
"They have changed, all right"

379
00:47:18,302 --> 00:47:20,736
"I'm breaking loose,
I'm breaking free..."

380
00:47:21,305 --> 00:47:23,933
"who knows where I'm going..."

381
00:47:24,208 --> 00:47:27,405
"I've begun to slide..."

382
00:47:28,312 --> 00:47:31,145
"what have you done to me?"

383
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:23,131
"What's makes you so innocent?"

384
00:48:23,433 --> 00:48:26,197
"It's because you're so sweet"

385
00:48:26,603 --> 00:48:29,470
"And why do you find me so sweet?
Tell me"

386
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:32,641
"Why must I tell you?"

387
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:54,696
"Say something"

388
00:48:55,232 --> 00:48:57,666
"What should I say?"

389
00:48:59,069 --> 00:49:01,435
"I'm breaking free,
I'm breaking loose..."

390
00:49:01,972 --> 00:49:04,634
"who knows where I'm going..."

391
00:49:04,975 --> 00:49:08,069
"I've begun to slide..."

392
00:49:09,046 --> 00:49:11,981
"I'm moving with you"

393
00:49:13,350 --> 00:49:15,841
"I'm breaking free,
I'm breaking loose..."

394
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:18,945
"who knows where I'm going..."

395
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:22,516
"I'm slipping..."

396
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:32,761
"what have you done to me?"

397
00:49:33,003 --> 00:49:35,938
"Over to you, I come"

398
00:49:48,285 --> 00:49:49,274
Mr Sukhwani...

399
00:49:49,886 --> 00:49:51,854
What is it...? Sister!

400
00:49:52,956 --> 00:49:56,517
What madness is this?
- All thanks to your darling son!

401
00:49:56,927 --> 00:49:59,862
I've got into the habit of
living with broken windows.

402
00:50:00,397 --> 00:50:03,855
I got breeze, water and even
the sunshine inside my house.

403
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:07,398
But ever since I fixed these panes,
it's suffocating and hot in there.

404
00:50:08,038 --> 00:50:12,771
But why must you break the panes?
Can't you just open the windows?

405
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:19,278
Why didn't it occur to me!
Thanks for the suggestion.

406
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:23,652
Shame on me! I must be the first
Sindhi to cause losses to himself!

407
00:50:27,057 --> 00:50:28,957
She's now your girlfriend.
- How?

408
00:50:29,593 --> 00:50:32,756
She presented you a bicycle?
- She even took you to the club?

409
00:50:33,063 --> 00:50:34,997
Yes, she danced with me too.
- She dropped you home...

410
00:50:35,232 --> 00:50:38,065
and said good night?
- Did she give you a good-night kiss?

411
00:50:39,236 --> 00:50:39,827
No.

412
00:50:40,504 --> 00:50:43,064
So how does she become his girlfriend?
- Why not?

413
00:50:44,141 --> 00:50:47,008
They become boyfriend and girlfriend
only when they exchange kisses.

414
00:50:48,145 --> 00:50:49,373
So what should he do?

415
00:50:49,813 --> 00:50:54,341
My Mummy's absolutely right.
Men are real idiots.

416
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:57,353
They don't even know that they
must further their friendship...

417
00:50:57,621 --> 00:51:01,648
before getting down to kisses.
- I want to meet your Mummy!

418
00:51:01,992 --> 00:51:04,324
She thinks we men are idiots?
- Oh yes.

419
00:51:05,028 --> 00:51:07,189
Know what, Rohit?
Give her a nice present.

420
00:51:08,231 --> 00:51:10,028
Where do I have the money
to give her a present?

421
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:11,660
Ma gives me just a rupee every day.

422
00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:15,504
But you can give Nisha a rose.
Can't you?

423
00:51:23,046 --> 00:51:26,709
Didn't you tell me about a boy
whose mind is like a child's?

424
00:51:28,051 --> 00:51:31,179
There was a nice article on the Net,
I've got a print-out.

425
00:51:31,822 --> 00:51:35,724
It says, such people ought to be
given a lot of love and sympathy.

426
00:51:36,126 --> 00:51:36,990
That is their only cure.

427
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:01,580
What are you up to?

428
00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:04,377
Come on up here.

429
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:15,424
Why're you hiding the rose?
- I'm not.

430
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:18,025
It's a present for you.

431
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:28,869
Why're you blushing?

432
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:33,415
My friends say...

433
00:52:34,451 --> 00:52:35,918
that when a girl and a boy
exchange kisses...

434
00:52:37,254 --> 00:52:38,414
they become boyfriend
and girlfriend.

435
00:52:39,856 --> 00:52:43,087
Your friends are right.
I am indeed your girlfriend.

436
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:45,055
Really? - Yes.

437
00:52:48,398 --> 00:52:49,763
Nisha...
- Yes, Papa?

438
00:52:50,367 --> 00:52:52,733
I must leave now.
- No, come on inside.

439
00:52:53,303 --> 00:52:54,930
My Mummy and Papa will be
very happy to meet you.

440
00:52:57,207 --> 00:52:58,834
Papa, Mama... this is Rohit.

441
00:53:00,810 --> 00:53:01,777
Sit down, son.

442
00:53:06,483 --> 00:53:08,246
Will you have something to
drink, Rohit? Tea, coffee...?

443
00:53:09,386 --> 00:53:12,651
Bournvita (a malt drink).
- Bournvita?

444
00:53:13,256 --> 00:53:16,123
Yes, Bournvita is a must
for strength and vigour.

445
00:53:16,393 --> 00:53:19,362
Look at me. I'm in the seventh,
but I'm the tallest in my class.

446
00:53:19,596 --> 00:53:20,358
Thanks to Bournvita.

447
00:53:25,435 --> 00:53:27,300
Sorry, Rohit. We have no Bournvita.

448
00:53:27,837 --> 00:53:29,065
No...?

449
00:53:29,973 --> 00:53:32,134
But you must have Bournvita at home!
You must drink it every day.

450
00:53:32,676 --> 00:53:35,668
Oh yes. We'll have some bought today.
- And we'll drink it too.

451
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:40,976
Call from District magistrate, sir.
- Tell him I'm coming.

452
00:53:42,786 --> 00:53:45,220
Nisha, save the page, my child.
I'll be back soon.

453
00:53:59,236 --> 00:54:00,669
You know computers?
- Yes.

454
00:54:01,438 --> 00:54:04,305
I also know that you want
to learn to operate it.

455
00:54:06,209 --> 00:54:07,574
Will you teach me?
- Of course.

456
00:54:08,478 --> 00:54:10,412
So let's go to my house!
I have my Papa's computer.

457
00:54:24,527 --> 00:54:25,789
These stars...?
- Yes!

458
00:54:26,196 --> 00:54:30,064
My Papa was a big scientist.
He spoke to people living on the stars.

459
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:31,695
Really! - Yes indeed.

460
00:54:39,376 --> 00:54:40,035
What's this?

461
00:54:43,046 --> 00:54:43,478
I don't know.

462
00:54:44,781 --> 00:54:46,408
Looks like one of
your Papa's projects.

463
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:51,610
Look, it says "press B"

464
00:54:58,461 --> 00:55:01,055
Nothing's happening.
- That says "B" too. See?

465
00:55:02,599 --> 00:55:03,793
Let's connect them and see.

466
00:55:50,914 --> 00:55:53,940
How did you play that?
- I know the tune. Ma taught me.

467
00:55:54,117 --> 00:55:54,549
Want to hear it?

468
00:56:05,862 --> 00:56:09,059
Rohit, teach me to play it.
- It's very easy. Give me your finger.

469
00:56:58,615 --> 00:57:02,051
"My dreams, my imagination..."

470
00:57:02,352 --> 00:57:04,616
"and my desires now have a face"

471
00:57:17,167 --> 00:57:20,102
"My existence has
a reason..."

472
00:57:21,237 --> 00:57:27,938
"now that I've found someone"

473
00:57:28,578 --> 00:57:32,014
"Whom have you found?"

474
00:57:32,549 --> 00:57:36,485
"I've found someone"

475
00:57:51,334 --> 00:57:56,772
"You and I did always meet..."

476
00:58:09,118 --> 00:58:11,951
"but why do I feel today..."

477
00:58:13,056 --> 00:58:19,484
"that I've found someone?"

478
00:58:20,430 --> 00:58:23,661
"Whom have you found?"

479
00:58:24,434 --> 00:58:27,665
"I 've found someone"

480
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:10,412
"What does meeting me do to you?
Tell me, will you?"

481
00:59:11,014 --> 00:59:14,177
"Tell me, will you?"

482
00:59:18,621 --> 00:59:22,523
"I'll tell you in your ear..."

483
00:59:22,792 --> 00:59:25,454
"come closer, will you?"

484
00:59:29,966 --> 00:59:33,527
"I know what you're
going to tell me"

485
00:59:33,736 --> 00:59:37,399
"I'm not going to heed
your request to come closer"

486
00:59:37,674 --> 00:59:41,201
"Listen to me... do listen!"

487
00:59:41,678 --> 00:59:47,878
"You and I did always talk..."

488
00:59:48,952 --> 00:59:51,648
"but why do I feel today..."

489
00:59:52,889 --> 00:59:59,624
"that I've found someone?"

490
01:00:00,196 --> 01:00:03,962
"Whom have you found?"

491
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:08,634
"I 've found someone"

492
01:00:49,145 --> 01:00:56,017
"When you are with me,
you're close to me..."

493
01:00:56,719 --> 01:01:00,086
"you're close to me,
even when you leave"

494
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:15,363
"There can't be a realisation
like this one"

495
01:01:15,705 --> 01:01:19,197
"I can't figure out
why all this happening..."

496
01:01:19,475 --> 01:01:23,036
"I can't figure out
what's happening in my heart"

497
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:27,040
"You must, figure it out!"

498
01:01:27,316 --> 01:01:33,482
"My heart did always beat..."

499
01:01:34,724 --> 01:01:37,488
"but why do I feel today..."

500
01:01:38,428 --> 01:01:45,766
"that I've found someone?"

501
01:01:46,035 --> 01:01:49,402
"Whom have you found?"

502
01:01:49,939 --> 01:01:53,773
"I 've found someone"

503
01:01:54,577 --> 01:01:57,842
"My dreams, my imagination..."

504
01:01:58,347 --> 01:02:00,315
"and my desires now have a face"

505
01:02:01,651 --> 01:02:04,119
"but why do I feel today..."

506
01:02:07,290 --> 01:02:09,918
"that I've found someone?"

507
01:02:11,127 --> 01:02:14,756
"I've found someone"

508
01:02:25,508 --> 01:02:29,444
Rohit, come quickly.
Dinner is served.

509
01:02:45,561 --> 01:02:48,826
Kasauli Tigers are a strong side...

510
01:02:49,065 --> 01:02:50,999
But the Blue Bulls are no easy team,
score is even at 50:50.

511
01:02:59,742 --> 01:03:02,643
Gas has entered the final few minutes
with score at 60:58.

512
01:03:02,879 --> 01:03:06,315
Blue Bulls passed the ball &
Kasauli Tigers have snatched it mid-way.

513
01:03:06,549 --> 01:03:08,380
Kasauli Tiger's Raj Saxena is
moving forward swiftly...

514
01:03:08,651 --> 01:03:10,141
...Crosses the halftime with the ball.

515
01:03:18,661 --> 01:03:19,093
You idiot!

516
01:03:20,263 --> 01:03:23,528
A beautiful girl walks
away with the boy.

517
01:03:23,766 --> 01:03:26,701
Girl takes away the boy and players
take away the ball.

518
01:03:26,936 --> 01:03:28,870
I'm confused over which game's
commentary should I give?

519
01:03:31,073 --> 01:03:34,042
Anyway, Raj moves forward and
passes the ball...

520
01:03:34,277 --> 01:03:36,211
But Blue Bulls snatch
the ballonce again...

521
01:03:36,445 --> 01:03:38,879
The game has resumed again and the
Blue Bulls seem to be in control.

522
01:03:39,715 --> 01:03:41,376
And a basket from the Blue Bulls!

523
01:03:41,651 --> 01:03:46,918
The scores are even, a few seconds to go
and the match is getting exciting...

524
01:03:47,156 --> 01:03:49,351
The game has resumed again and
Blue Bulls seem to be in control.

525
01:03:49,659 --> 01:03:54,255
The supporters of both the side
are vociferously cheering their teams.

526
01:03:54,831 --> 01:04:03,034
And there's another basket
by Raj Saxena!

527
01:04:06,943 --> 01:04:11,880
The winners of the Hero Cup
are the Kasauli Tigers!

528
01:04:47,917 --> 01:04:48,849
What's happening here, Rohit?

529
01:04:50,253 --> 01:04:53,245
I want to play basketball too.
I too want to become a champion.

530
01:04:54,090 --> 01:04:55,352
People will clap for me then.

531
01:04:58,427 --> 01:05:01,362
Like Nisha was clapping for me?

532
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:08,136
But how will you learn on your own?
Let us teach you.

533
01:05:09,171 --> 01:05:12,163
Will you really teach me?
- Of course. We'll teach you.

534
01:05:33,262 --> 01:05:37,198
You're not hurt, are you?
- No... it's okay. Go ahead.

535
01:05:43,606 --> 01:05:45,699
I don't want to learn!
I don't want to!

536
01:05:56,986 --> 01:05:59,546
How will you get any applause
unless you learn?

537
01:06:09,932 --> 01:06:11,524
You dare take me on
over Nisha?

538
01:06:12,768 --> 01:06:16,534
Watch your step in the future.
Understand?

539
01:06:32,154 --> 01:06:34,213
Ma says those who sin
are always punished.

540
01:06:36,325 --> 01:06:39,920
But I have committed no sin.
So why am I being punished?

541
01:06:41,998 --> 01:06:42,760
Everybody pokes fun at me.

542
01:06:44,834 --> 01:06:46,597
If You don't help me,
who will?

543
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:49,096
You have so much of strength.

544
01:06:51,674 --> 01:06:52,936
Give me some of Your strength, Lord.

545
01:06:54,677 --> 01:06:58,078
Please... give me some strength, Lord!

546
01:09:04,073 --> 01:09:04,835
What are you up to...?!

547
01:09:05,074 --> 01:09:09,636
What have you been doing!
- I did nothing.

548
01:09:09,879 --> 01:09:14,680
It's happening on its own, Ma!
- You did nothing...? Nothing?

549
01:09:31,901 --> 01:09:32,560
What's happening, Ma?

550
01:09:33,302 --> 01:09:34,769
There's a power failure in the
whole of the city, sir.

551
01:09:35,337 --> 01:09:36,497
It's pitch dark everywhere.

552
01:09:38,641 --> 01:09:39,630
What's up with this torch, Sukhwani?

553
01:09:39,975 --> 01:09:41,237
It doesn't work on electricity anyway.

554
01:09:44,446 --> 01:09:48,109
Looks like there's going to be a storm.
A deadly storm.

555
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:31,992
Sir! Look!

556
01:10:36,265 --> 01:10:36,856
God!

557
01:11:29,251 --> 01:11:35,486
There's news of a UFO being sighted
in Kasauli, in Northern India.

558
01:11:36,225 --> 01:11:40,662
Several space organisations all over
the world refuse to believe this incident

559
01:11:41,130 --> 01:11:44,588
Because no radar station in the world
nor satellites in space...

560
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:46,792
could detect any signals of the UFO.

561
01:11:47,336 --> 01:11:50,669
But UFO legends abound,
like ghost stories.

562
01:11:51,307 --> 01:11:55,471
Those who see them, believe them.
Those who don't, refuse to believe it.

563
01:11:56,045 --> 01:12:02,314
A similar UFO sighting was reported
in Bangalore in May, 2001.

564
01:12:03,052 --> 01:12:05,247
There are claims of UFO sightings
not only in India...

565
01:12:05,521 --> 01:12:07,819
but all over the world.

566
01:12:08,157 --> 01:12:11,149
Although there is no strong evidence,
there are people who believe in them.

567
01:13:04,713 --> 01:13:08,046
The burning grass and this crater
is evidence that the spacecraft...

568
01:13:08,984 --> 01:13:13,648
that flew over Kasauli last night
landed right here.

569
01:13:15,224 --> 01:13:17,249
Looks like this is where
the spacecraft landed.

570
01:13:20,262 --> 01:13:21,229
This is amazing!

571
01:13:22,431 --> 01:13:27,562
The aliens from another planet chose
our town over the rest of the world!

572
01:13:28,203 --> 01:13:33,607
Lmagine how popular and famous
our little hill station is going to be!

573
01:13:34,109 --> 01:13:37,977
I announce a two-day official holiday
to celebrate this event!

574
01:13:58,801 --> 01:13:59,392
What's all this?

575
01:14:00,569 --> 01:14:03,538
There's a carnival at Mall Road.
People are dressed like aliens.

576
01:14:03,772 --> 01:14:06,673
C'mon, Rohit. Wear something unusual.
- All right. I'll be back in a moment.

577
01:14:16,385 --> 01:14:21,846
What are you doing? - I'm making
eyes and a mouth on this pitcher.

578
01:14:22,791 --> 01:14:24,725
What for? - I'm going to dress up
like an alien...

579
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:26,052
and go to the carnival
with my friends.

580
01:14:29,131 --> 01:14:30,223
Like an alien...?

581
01:14:31,633 --> 01:14:32,565
You're not going anywhere.

582
01:14:33,469 --> 01:14:35,403
Why not? All my friends
are going, Ma.

583
01:14:35,637 --> 01:14:36,934
There's a difference between
the rest of them and you...

584
01:14:37,172 --> 01:14:40,266
What difference?
- No arguments, I say!

585
01:14:40,509 --> 01:14:43,307
You're not going. That's it.
- God! Let's go!

586
01:14:59,995 --> 01:15:04,489
Extra terrestrials... aliens?

587
01:15:05,501 --> 01:15:07,093
What are you saying, Mr Khan?

588
01:15:07,569 --> 01:15:10,732
It's a fact that a spaceship
landed here, Harbans.

589
01:15:11,573 --> 01:15:14,201
It could also be a fact that someone
emerged from the spaceship.

590
01:15:14,443 --> 01:15:17,412
That's right, sir. That's exactly
what has happened.

591
01:15:17,746 --> 01:15:20,044
I have inspected the whole region.

592
01:15:20,582 --> 01:15:25,042
From the footprints, it appears as if
some aliens came out of the spaceship.

593
01:15:25,954 --> 01:15:27,581
But... - But what?

594
01:15:29,658 --> 01:15:34,618
One of them did not go back.
- What makes you say that?

595
01:15:36,365 --> 01:15:39,300
There were footprints of some aliens
which led to the jungles...

596
01:15:40,335 --> 01:15:44,203
but the footprints of one of them
did not lead back to the spaceship.

597
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:47,976
What if they are indeed the
footprints of an alien?

598
01:15:48,644 --> 01:15:49,804
We'll capture it.

599
01:15:50,045 --> 01:15:53,208
That will be a bigger achievement
that man landing on the Moon.

600
01:15:53,448 --> 01:15:55,541
It'll unravel thousands of
secrets of the universe.

601
01:15:56,151 --> 01:15:58,949
But what if the alien is dangerous?
- We'll simply shoot it.

602
01:16:00,155 --> 01:16:04,615
Whatever it is, till this is
fully proved...

603
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:06,791
we must keep it to ourselves.

604
01:16:07,829 --> 01:16:09,228
The whole of the hill station is
in a festive mood...

605
01:16:09,464 --> 01:16:11,022
it'll unnecessarily spread panic.

606
01:16:43,765 --> 01:16:47,132
It's no use calling me!
Ma won't let me go! Go away, Bittu!

607
01:16:56,411 --> 01:16:59,539
What are you whistling for?
Haven't I said, I can't come? Go away!

608
01:17:41,990 --> 01:17:44,925
Know what, Rohit? There's an alien
in the forest.

609
01:17:46,161 --> 01:17:47,093
What's an alien?

610
01:17:48,997 --> 01:17:51,022
Those from other planets
are called aliens.

611
01:17:52,100 --> 01:17:54,193
How are they to look at?
- I don't know.

612
01:17:55,237 --> 01:17:58,263
They could look like animals,
or even like us.

613
01:17:59,675 --> 01:18:02,303
Could they even look like Bittu?
- Bittu?

614
01:18:02,544 --> 01:18:07,038
Yes, a kid came from the forest last night.
I thought it was Bittu.

615
01:18:07,282 --> 01:18:10,945
I smashed the pitcher and shouted at him.
He ran away into the forest.

616
01:18:11,687 --> 01:18:14,679
And see...? The pitcher's been
put together.

617
01:18:14,956 --> 01:18:16,753
It must've been another pitcher.
- No, this is the one.

618
01:18:16,992 --> 01:18:18,755
I drew eyes and a mouth on it.
Take a look.

619
01:18:23,331 --> 01:18:26,767
It wasn't that alien, was it?
- Let's go and check.

620
01:18:27,002 --> 01:18:32,668
If it can put together a pitcher,
it can do anything. I'm feeling scared.

621
01:18:32,908 --> 01:18:36,503
What's there to be scared of?
I'm with you. Come on, come.

622
01:19:08,910 --> 01:19:14,473
Rohit, looks like it was really a kid.
- Yes. Let's go back. - Let's go.

623
01:20:23,819 --> 01:20:24,911
Have you landed from up there?

624
01:20:32,594 --> 01:20:34,459
That's where he seems
to have come from.

625
01:20:39,334 --> 01:20:40,995
We must do something for him.

626
01:20:42,637 --> 01:20:46,630
If the police catch him,
God knows what they will do.

627
01:20:47,442 --> 01:20:51,310
And if he remains in the jungle,
the wild animals will eat him up.

628
01:20:53,682 --> 01:20:59,678
So what must we do?
- We'll have to hide him.

629
01:21:03,525 --> 01:21:04,651
Will you go with us?

630
01:21:07,596 --> 01:21:08,722
Will you be my friend?

631
01:22:36,451 --> 01:22:38,078
Jai Hind, sir. - Jai Hind.

632
01:22:39,988 --> 01:22:40,682
Good morning, sir.

633
01:22:44,426 --> 01:22:46,360
Have this roll developed and printed.
- Okay.

634
01:22:46,594 --> 01:22:47,083
Make it fast.

635
01:22:49,397 --> 01:22:54,858
You've done an amazing job, sir!
This is a fantastic idea!

636
01:22:55,103 --> 01:22:58,334
A policeman's job can't be trusted.
Hired today, fired tomorrow.

637
01:22:58,573 --> 01:23:01,201
Especially with an honest man like you,
anything is possible.

638
01:23:01,443 --> 01:23:04,105
What rubbish are you talking Sukhwani?
- I'm only praising you.

639
01:23:04,346 --> 01:23:09,374
This is a terrific side-business.
As long as weddings are held...

640
01:23:09,651 --> 01:23:14,281
you're going to do roaring business!
- Sukhwani! Do as you are told

641
01:23:22,397 --> 01:23:23,728
This is Khan here, sir.

642
01:23:24,432 --> 01:23:28,163
I've taken pictures of the footprints
as you asked me to.

643
01:23:28,403 --> 01:23:30,735
I'll soon have them sent to you.

644
01:23:31,072 --> 01:23:35,008
Your opinion in this matter is
very important, sir.

645
01:24:32,700 --> 01:24:34,395
What happened...? What's wrong?

646
01:24:35,003 --> 01:24:35,435
What?

647
01:24:40,542 --> 01:24:41,338
What happened?

648
01:24:41,876 --> 01:24:43,844
Rohit, open the door

649
01:24:48,383 --> 01:24:51,511
I'm glad you're here.
- Why? Any problem?

650
01:24:51,786 --> 01:24:53,811
Yes, he was screaming away!

651
01:24:56,791 --> 01:24:58,452
He must be hungry.

652
01:25:00,061 --> 01:25:02,427
There are so many things here.
He won't eat anything.

653
01:25:03,465 --> 01:25:04,693
He must be eating something else.

654
01:25:06,167 --> 01:25:07,691
What do you eat?

655
01:25:14,442 --> 01:25:15,033
Glass?

656
01:25:20,181 --> 01:25:20,875
Wood?

657
01:25:22,383 --> 01:25:24,248
The net? The ventilator?

658
01:25:24,919 --> 01:25:28,753
- No, Rohit He's trying
to say something else.

659
01:25:31,259 --> 01:25:34,228
The air...? The rays?

660
01:25:36,297 --> 01:25:39,266
Sunlight? - Sunlight!

661
01:25:39,868 --> 01:25:41,392
God! He speaks!

662
01:25:43,171 --> 01:25:44,729
He understands what we say!

663
01:25:45,640 --> 01:25:49,633
Which means, apart from having those
powers, he's also very intelligent.

664
01:25:50,044 --> 01:25:53,013
Oh yes. But how's he
going to eat the sunlight?

665
01:25:53,248 --> 01:25:54,545
Sunlight isn't something
you eat, is it?

666
01:25:54,782 --> 01:25:58,218
What we eat gives
our body its energy.

667
01:25:58,453 --> 01:26:01,013
Maybe they draw their energy
from sunlight.

668
01:26:13,568 --> 01:26:16,002
Rohit, look...

669
01:26:16,971 --> 01:26:18,563
Hide quickly! Hurry!

670
01:26:25,380 --> 01:26:26,472
What are you doing here
so early in the day...?

671
01:26:26,714 --> 01:26:29,239
Nothing at all, Ma.

672
01:26:29,517 --> 01:26:33,009
Nisha! When did you arrive?
- Right now, auntie.

673
01:26:33,288 --> 01:26:37,190
So join us for breakfast. Come on.
- Go ahead. We'll come in a while.

674
01:26:38,193 --> 01:26:40,855
I'm getting late for the office.
Come quickly.

675
01:26:51,906 --> 01:26:56,866
Why's that jug of water here?
Bring it along when you come, okay?

676
01:27:00,381 --> 01:27:02,611
Don't come out.
We'll be back in a moment, okay?

677
01:27:05,286 --> 01:27:09,120
Bye, Nisha... Rohit, make sure
you finish your breakfast!

678
01:27:10,959 --> 01:27:11,391
Wow!

679
01:27:22,737 --> 01:27:25,297
Found the ball, Bittu? - No.

680
01:27:25,540 --> 01:27:27,167
What a sixer. The ball's disappeared
outside the stadium!

681
01:27:27,408 --> 01:27:30,138
Not outside the stadium.
It's inside that outhouse. Look.

682
01:27:31,179 --> 01:27:32,612
Yes, come on. - Come on.

683
01:27:38,853 --> 01:27:39,945
Where's the ball?

684
01:27:48,496 --> 01:27:50,760
What are you guys doing here?
- There's someone in there!

685
01:27:50,999 --> 01:27:54,594
A ghost! - A monkey!
- Our ball is in his hand.

686
01:27:57,805 --> 01:28:00,672
Why have you come out?
Didn't I tell you not to come out?

687
01:28:06,180 --> 01:28:09,547
What ball? You've ruined everything!
Everybody's got to know!

688
01:28:11,486 --> 01:28:12,475
Who's that?

689
01:28:13,154 --> 01:28:17,648
First promise us that you will not
utter a word about this to anyone.

690
01:28:20,228 --> 01:28:22,628
He's a friend of mine.
Like all of you are.

691
01:28:28,636 --> 01:28:31,730
He came in that spaceship.

692
01:28:32,106 --> 01:28:35,075
The spaceship has left,
but this poor chap got left behind.

693
01:29:23,558 --> 01:29:25,253
Magic! - That's magic! Magic!

694
01:29:25,493 --> 01:29:27,256
"Magic..."

695
01:29:28,930 --> 01:29:30,397
"Magic..."

696
01:29:54,756 --> 01:30:04,188
"Magic..."

697
01:30:25,319 --> 01:30:35,126
"The earth and the skies..."
"the rose and the rosegardens..."

698
01:30:35,363 --> 01:30:40,266
"the hills and the winds
are meeting today"

699
01:30:40,501 --> 01:30:49,637
"This is magic..."

700
01:30:49,911 --> 01:30:59,286
"sheer magic"

701
01:31:26,581 --> 01:31:28,776
"What spell is this?"

702
01:31:29,016 --> 01:31:31,246
"It's a new language of
love altogether"

703
01:31:31,519 --> 01:31:36,388
"No one despairs anymore"

704
01:31:46,200 --> 01:31:50,830
"We're silent..."
"so are you"

705
01:31:51,105 --> 01:31:55,041
"And yet, we say so much"

706
01:31:55,276 --> 01:32:00,475
"How did this wonder happen?"

707
01:32:00,715 --> 01:32:09,123
"It's magic..."

708
01:32:09,357 --> 01:32:19,961
"sheer magic"

709
01:32:57,805 --> 01:33:00,069
"You are the one our eyes cherish..."

710
01:33:00,274 --> 01:33:02,469
"you are the one
who lives in our heart..."

711
01:33:02,710 --> 01:33:07,613
"we expect nothing from you in return"

712
01:33:22,296 --> 01:33:26,858
"That you have come to see us..."

713
01:33:27,168 --> 01:33:31,195
"we dream lovely dreams"

714
01:33:31,439 --> 01:33:36,502
"Promise to be a friend always"

715
01:33:36,744 --> 01:33:46,119
"It's magic..."

716
01:33:46,387 --> 01:33:56,023
"sheer magic"

717
01:34:04,672 --> 01:34:05,934
Why're you guys laughing so much?

718
01:34:06,307 --> 01:34:07,899
Some new spaceship joke on SMS?

719
01:34:08,142 --> 01:34:11,908
The spaceship is old hat. We're laughing
at a new twist to the story!

720
01:34:12,813 --> 01:34:15,247
Will Nisha and Rohit's children
be normal or abnormal?

721
01:34:16,450 --> 01:34:17,542
Rohit and Nisha's children?

722
01:34:17,818 --> 01:34:21,219
As if you don't know. Nisha spends
all her time with Rohit.

723
01:34:22,923 --> 01:34:25,391
Raj, do something
while you have the time.

724
01:34:25,826 --> 01:34:28,317
Else, that madcap will make away
with your goodies.

725
01:34:36,404 --> 01:34:38,770
Harbans, any news on the alien?

726
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:44,334
No. Looks like Inspector Khan
was mistaken.

727
01:34:45,312 --> 01:34:47,940
Else, we'd have had some
information on it by now.

728
01:34:52,086 --> 01:34:54,680
I have good news for you.
- Good news? What good news?

729
01:34:54,955 --> 01:34:56,946
Your son has decided to get married.

730
01:34:59,560 --> 01:35:00,390
It's Nisha, Uncle.

731
01:35:06,067 --> 01:35:09,264
Hear this? Nisha and Raj
have approved each other!

732
01:35:09,503 --> 01:35:13,303
Really...? This is wonderful news!

733
01:35:13,541 --> 01:35:14,439
What say, Indu?

734
01:35:17,178 --> 01:35:17,837
What happened?

735
01:35:18,079 --> 01:35:21,207
Do you guys know?
Nisha's getting married to Raj.

736
01:35:21,449 --> 01:35:25,613
How did you get to know?
- My parents were at the club last night.

737
01:35:25,886 --> 01:35:28,184
They're the ones who told me.
- But how's that possible?

738
01:35:28,422 --> 01:35:32,381
Nisha is Rohit's girlfriend.
Let's go and tell him. - C'mon.

739
01:36:10,898 --> 01:36:13,059
Why did you lie?
When did I agree?

740
01:36:13,300 --> 01:36:16,269
You didn't disagree either. And that's
what our parents want too.

741
01:36:16,504 --> 01:36:18,369
It isn't about our parents.
It's about telling lies.

742
01:36:18,606 --> 01:36:19,834
Where have I spoken a lie?

743
01:36:22,810 --> 01:36:25,608
That we like each other doesn't mean
we get married, Raj.

744
01:36:25,846 --> 01:36:28,747
In any case, it's necessary to get to
know each other before getting married.

745
01:36:30,751 --> 01:36:34,949
As things stand today, we won't get
to know each other all our lives.

746
01:36:35,222 --> 01:36:38,623
What do you mean?
- Do you think I'm blind?

747
01:36:38,893 --> 01:36:40,360
Can't I see you and Rohit
are having an affair?

748
01:36:41,729 --> 01:36:45,665
What did you say?
Rohit and I...? An affair?

749
01:36:48,969 --> 01:36:50,937
Even if we are having an affair,
what is it to you?

750
01:36:51,172 --> 01:36:52,969
Whom I see is entirely my business.

751
01:36:53,207 --> 01:36:55,641
You have no right to interfere
in my personal life.

752
01:36:55,876 --> 01:36:59,277
Do you get that?
- You're insulting me for that fool?

753
01:36:59,380 --> 01:37:00,574
He is not a fool.

754
01:37:02,249 --> 01:37:04,342
Looks like you've got to
know him very well!

755
01:37:04,618 --> 01:37:08,884
Yes. Very well.
Him... and you, too.

756
01:37:21,535 --> 01:37:22,900
What's going on over here...?

757
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:26,898
What happened, Rohit?

758
01:37:31,278 --> 01:37:34,076
Nisha's getting married, Ma.
With Raj.

759
01:37:35,049 --> 01:37:39,986
So why are you upset?
Every girl gets married some day.

760
01:37:40,221 --> 01:37:42,121
But Nisha's my girlfriend, Ma!

761
01:37:42,256 --> 01:37:48,058
What...? Nisha...?
Your girlfriend? - Yes!

762
01:37:51,365 --> 01:37:56,302
Because she spoke lovingly to you,
does that make her your girlfriend?

763
01:37:56,537 --> 01:37:58,368
She herself told me that
she's my girlfriend!

764
01:37:58,606 --> 01:38:02,633
And that I'm her boyfriend.
- She mustn't have meant it.

765
01:38:03,944 --> 01:38:06,674
Nisha is an educated
and sensible girl.

766
01:38:08,716 --> 01:38:15,451
She can be your friend...
not a companion for life. - Why not?

767
01:38:17,758 --> 01:38:27,565
Rohit, although you have grown up...
you're still a child.

768
01:38:29,803 --> 01:38:32,897
You're not like boys of your age.
- Why not?

769
01:38:33,140 --> 01:38:34,539
Why am I not like the other boys?

770
01:38:34,775 --> 01:38:38,176
I haven't done anything wrong...
so why's Nisha also leaving me?

771
01:38:45,619 --> 01:38:47,018
Everything would have been fine...

772
01:38:49,356 --> 01:38:51,449
had only we not seen that spaceship.

773
01:38:53,694 --> 01:38:58,529
Your father would have been
alive today and you...

774
01:39:00,367 --> 01:39:01,959
you wouldn't have been like this.

775
01:39:03,370 --> 01:39:08,467
A spaceship? Papa...?
What happened, Ma?

776
01:39:08,943 --> 01:39:10,205
We met with an accident.

777
01:40:00,160 --> 01:40:01,252
What are you doing here?!

778
01:40:01,495 --> 01:40:07,491
Get ready quickly.
I'll serve the breakfast.

779
01:40:11,372 --> 01:40:12,339
Stop smiling and go back
to the outhouse.

780
01:40:12,573 --> 01:40:16,031
Don't come out again,
you'll get caught. Go!

781
01:40:38,165 --> 01:40:41,566
Ma! I can't see anything!

782
01:40:42,036 --> 01:40:45,233
Wash your eyes...
you'll be able to see.

783
01:41:05,359 --> 01:41:07,554
Ma! I can see everything!

784
01:41:07,795 --> 01:41:11,492
You say you can't see anything and
then you say you can see everything!

785
01:41:11,732 --> 01:41:13,962
Hurry up, son.
You'll be late for school.

786
01:41:17,137 --> 01:41:18,035
Time for computer classes.

787
01:41:18,272 --> 01:41:21,730
You mustn't come, Rohit.
The teacher will again scold you.

788
01:41:21,975 --> 01:41:24,170
Why will he scold me now?
I'm already studying computers.

789
01:41:24,545 --> 01:41:27,343
Rohit, where are your glasses?
Have you forgotten them at home?

790
01:41:27,581 --> 01:41:30,948
No, I left it them home. This morning,
I could see everything clearly.

791
01:41:31,218 --> 01:41:34,051
Really? - Oh yes.

792
01:41:34,621 --> 01:41:37,556
In that case, read what Mr Chaturvedi
is writing on the blackboard.

793
01:41:49,970 --> 01:41:53,235
I want the answer to that, boys.

794
01:42:12,259 --> 01:42:13,419
Who gave that answer?

795
01:42:16,797 --> 01:42:21,734
Rohit, you orally solved a problem
meant for the tenth standard?

796
01:42:24,204 --> 01:42:24,966
Come inside.

797
01:42:27,107 --> 01:42:32,443
Was that guess-work, or was it...?
- Was that the right answer, sir?

798
01:42:32,913 --> 01:42:36,076
Absolutely right.
But how did you solve it?

799
01:42:36,316 --> 01:42:38,546
I don't know, sir.
It just came to me.

800
01:42:39,319 --> 01:42:43,722
Rohit...? I can't believe it.
- Neither can I, sir.

801
01:42:43,957 --> 01:42:45,982
But this is a fact.
- Where is Rohit?

802
01:42:46,260 --> 01:42:49,661
How many times have I told you
that you can't learn computers.

803
01:42:50,063 --> 01:42:51,621
You'd rather learn carpentry
or masonry!

804
01:42:52,366 --> 01:42:55,233
But you turn up every time and I have
to insult you and drive you out.

805
01:42:55,469 --> 01:42:59,997
Mr Mathur! Is that the way
you talk to your students?

806
01:43:00,274 --> 01:43:02,742
Father, this boy has zero I.Q.

807
01:43:03,076 --> 01:43:05,636
He needs a doctor, not a teacher.

808
01:43:05,946 --> 01:43:07,607
See for yourself.

809
01:43:08,248 --> 01:43:12,014
Tell me: Without opening
a particular file...

810
01:43:12,553 --> 01:43:15,545
how will you copy data from Windows
drive "A" to any other drive?

811
01:43:16,857 --> 01:43:20,258
You are deliberately asking him a
difficult question to belittle him.

812
01:43:20,494 --> 01:43:22,291
To begin with, go to programs...

813
01:43:22,529 --> 01:43:26,295
when the Windows Explorer has started,
right-click on the file.

814
01:43:26,533 --> 01:43:28,501
And without releasing the button,
take the file to another drive...

815
01:43:28,735 --> 01:43:31,329
and release the button.
The file will be copied, sir.

816
01:43:37,878 --> 01:43:40,608
Didn't you tell me to learn it
from my father, sir?

817
01:43:41,582 --> 01:43:43,140
I've learnt it from my Papa.

818
01:43:45,319 --> 01:43:48,652
You are a teacher, who's responsible
for thousands of students, sir.

819
01:43:48,889 --> 01:43:51,517
You ought to inspire them
to move ahead in life.

820
01:43:52,025 --> 01:43:55,324
Computer did not make man,
man made the computer.

821
01:43:55,562 --> 01:43:58,725
So what the brains can accomplish,
your computers never can, sir.

822
01:43:59,466 --> 01:44:01,434
Do not ever consider anyone
to be small, sir.

823
01:44:01,802 --> 01:44:05,636
Because what is small
will become big some day, sir.

824
01:44:18,085 --> 01:44:20,610
Did you notice the look
on Mr Mathur's face?

825
01:44:20,887 --> 01:44:23,617
But what makes you suddenly
so smart, Rohit?

826
01:44:24,258 --> 01:44:27,523
There is a hitch. You will
forget about us now, won't you?

827
01:44:28,095 --> 01:44:30,859
You'll have grown up friends.
- Rubbish! That's not true.

828
01:44:31,431 --> 01:44:33,365
You are my friends and
will always remain my friends.

829
01:44:35,936 --> 01:44:38,029
Rohit, pass the ball.

830
01:44:40,107 --> 01:44:42,701
Whom are you asking? This idiot, who's
still feeding on his mother's milk?

831
01:44:46,613 --> 01:44:47,375
What are you staring at?

832
01:45:00,427 --> 01:45:04,523
Rohit! Look at the ball!

833
01:45:13,106 --> 01:45:17,202
You think you've become too tough?
Go check him out.

834
01:45:22,616 --> 01:45:23,548
What a punch!

835
01:45:24,818 --> 01:45:26,046
You've even got the strength!

836
01:45:32,993 --> 01:45:33,755
Goodness!

837
01:45:34,328 --> 01:45:40,597
Muscles! Take a look!

838
01:45:43,003 --> 01:45:48,441
Don't stare... c'mon!

839
01:45:54,848 --> 01:45:56,440
Looks like you guys haven't
had your mother's milk.

840
01:45:56,717 --> 01:45:58,947
Make sure you have it next time.
We'll have a nice bout.

841
01:46:05,659 --> 01:46:06,421
Why have you come here?

842
01:46:07,327 --> 01:46:09,761
Are you angry with me?
- Yes.

843
01:46:10,664 --> 01:46:12,598
Why? - Because you're
not my friend.

844
01:46:13,166 --> 01:46:13,928
You're going away with Raj.

845
01:46:15,836 --> 01:46:18,930
I'm not going with Raj. - No?

846
01:46:19,673 --> 01:46:23,439
I've turned him down.
- Great! I don't like him.

847
01:46:24,344 --> 01:46:27,780
I don't like him either.
- We share our likes, don't we?

848
01:46:29,182 --> 01:46:32,447
We share our likes and
understand each other too.

849
01:46:33,387 --> 01:46:35,150
Which is why I have come
to make you see reason.

850
01:46:37,224 --> 01:46:42,491
Every girl has to get married some day.
She has to settle down.

851
01:46:43,063 --> 01:46:44,325
Oh yes, that is true.

852
01:46:44,898 --> 01:46:46,832
So tell me what kind of a boy
you would like.

853
01:46:47,067 --> 01:46:49,831
I'll find him for you.
- You will find him for me?

854
01:46:50,070 --> 01:46:51,503
Yes. We share our likes, after all.

855
01:46:51,738 --> 01:46:53,501
You will like what I like.

856
01:46:53,907 --> 01:46:55,841
Okay then, which boys do you like?

857
01:46:57,744 --> 01:47:00,008
There's Bunty, Bittu, Aslam...
several others too.

858
01:47:00,847 --> 01:47:04,112
They're kids. - But I'm a grown up.

859
01:47:04,384 --> 01:47:05,942
It'll be great fun!
We'll always be together.

860
01:47:06,219 --> 01:47:08,779
We'll go out together and
drink Bournvita all the time!

861
01:47:09,890 --> 01:47:12,654
Marriage isn't just about
drinking Bournvita, Rohit.

862
01:47:13,560 --> 01:47:15,494
It's a huge responsibility.

863
01:47:16,563 --> 01:47:19,498
A responsibility of giving
his wife lots of love, isn't it?

864
01:47:20,400 --> 01:47:22,994
One can't live on love alone, Rohit.

865
01:47:24,070 --> 01:47:29,337
Every girl seeks a companion
who's mentally and physically strong.

866
01:47:48,628 --> 01:47:49,890
Am I not physically strong?

867
01:47:50,997 --> 01:48:01,771
Yes you are. - A bit raw mentally?
But I'll ripen.

868
01:48:04,744 --> 01:48:05,335
Just keep watching.

869
01:48:08,915 --> 01:48:11,008
I threw an amazing punch!

870
01:48:11,284 --> 01:48:13,514
And Nisha...! She was
stunned with my attitude!

871
01:48:13,787 --> 01:48:17,689
And that ball! One kick
and it kept flying and flying!

872
01:48:23,797 --> 01:48:27,233
You're the one who did
all this, isn't it?

873
01:48:40,981 --> 01:48:42,915
No, Ma. Don't be afraid!
This is Jadoo, he's a friend.

874
01:48:43,483 --> 01:48:45,246
Get away from there!

875
01:48:46,520 --> 01:48:47,248
How did this thing land here!

876
01:48:48,021 --> 01:48:51,286
Don't scream, Ma! Someone might
come here... listen to me, Ma!

877
01:48:51,525 --> 01:48:55,461
Hear me out at least...!
- Keep away from it!

878
01:48:55,695 --> 01:48:56,286
What is it?

879
01:48:57,364 --> 01:48:59,628
He came in that spaceship
we saw recently.

880
01:48:59,866 --> 01:49:01,731
What? - I brought him
from the forest.

881
01:49:01,968 --> 01:49:03,902
He has been with me ever since.
He's very nice, Ma.

882
01:49:04,137 --> 01:49:06,230
Very nice?
Are you out of your mind?

883
01:49:06,640 --> 01:49:08,574
He's not staying here another moment!

884
01:49:08,808 --> 01:49:09,900
I'm calling the police right now!

885
01:49:10,143 --> 01:49:14,580
Listen to me, Ma! - How dare you
hide that thing here!

886
01:49:14,814 --> 01:49:16,247
He has done us so many favours and

887
01:49:16,483 --> 01:49:17,245
You'll turn him over to the police?

888
01:49:17,517 --> 01:49:20,247
Favours! What favours?
- Take a look at me, Ma! Listen to me!

889
01:49:20,520 --> 01:49:22,579
I'm not looking or
listening to anything!

890
01:49:26,860 --> 01:49:29,124
Mrs Mehra? This is Father Rodericks.

891
01:49:29,696 --> 01:49:33,632
How have you managed this?
Rohit is a changed man.

892
01:49:34,200 --> 01:49:38,296
The whole school is astonished
at his knowledge and intelligence.

893
01:49:41,374 --> 01:49:45,970
And we have decided to
promote Rohit to Class 10.

894
01:49:47,547 --> 01:49:48,309
Are you listening?

895
01:49:51,585 --> 01:49:53,519
What's the matter, Ma?
Who called?

896
01:49:54,087 --> 01:49:54,815
The Principal.

897
01:49:56,756 --> 01:50:00,852
They've promoted you
to Class 10, Rohit.

898
01:50:02,262 --> 01:50:04,196
That's because they don't have a
higher class than the tenth, Ma!

899
01:50:06,600 --> 01:50:08,864
But how did all this...?

900
01:50:09,269 --> 01:50:10,702
It's a miracle Jadoo has worked, Ma.

901
01:50:10,937 --> 01:50:12,700
Look, I'm not the same Rohit anymore.

902
01:50:14,107 --> 01:50:16,041
Your glasses...?

903
01:50:16,776 --> 01:50:18,869
I can see everything now, Ma.
And I can understand too.

904
01:50:19,112 --> 01:50:21,376
I have become worldly wise.

905
01:51:28,014 --> 01:51:32,280
From the photographs Inspector Khan
sent us, it is proved...

906
01:51:32,552 --> 01:51:34,110
that they are the footprints
of an alien.

907
01:51:34,387 --> 01:51:36,150
We are here for further research.

908
01:51:37,223 --> 01:51:40,624
Which means your hunch
was right, Khan.

909
01:51:43,396 --> 01:51:47,992
Tell me something, doctor.
This creature from another planet...

910
01:51:48,401 --> 01:51:49,333
is it dangerous?

911
01:51:51,738 --> 01:51:55,674
Had it been dangerous, it would
surely have done something by now.

912
01:51:56,076 --> 01:51:58,670
But we haven't received
any such reports.

913
01:51:59,579 --> 01:52:03,106
Couldn't the silence also mean
that it's dead?

914
01:52:03,349 --> 01:52:06,785
Perhaps. But even its dead body
will be very precious to us, sir.

915
01:52:07,220 --> 01:52:11,122
To capture the alien dead or alive,
I'll have to comb the entire area, sir.

916
01:52:11,891 --> 01:52:13,483
I'll need extra forces for that.

917
01:52:19,065 --> 01:52:22,660
Hey Jadoo, how do I look?

918
01:52:45,458 --> 01:52:48,859
Rohit! What's gotten into you?
- I don't talk to kids.

919
01:52:50,296 --> 01:52:51,729
It isn't my age to play
children's games anymore.

920
01:52:53,299 --> 01:52:55,062
It's time for me to sing and dance.
Tell that to everyone.

921
01:52:58,138 --> 01:53:01,335
What? Rohit's turned a hero?
- Yes, didi (sister)

922
01:53:01,574 --> 01:53:05,169
And he says, it's time for him
to sing and dance.

923
01:53:23,630 --> 01:53:26,064
Rohit! What are you doing?
- Practice!

924
01:53:26,299 --> 01:53:27,891
Practice? - Yes, look at them.

925
01:53:32,138 --> 01:53:34,402
I'm a bit raw.
Trying to ripen.

926
01:53:34,641 --> 01:53:37,906
Or else, people will laugh at you.
- Me? Why will they laugh at me?

927
01:53:38,478 --> 01:53:39,740
Because you're my girlfriend.

928
01:53:40,313 --> 01:53:42,247
If I'm raw, won't they laugh at you?

929
01:53:53,860 --> 01:53:56,294
You're participating in the contest?
- Yes.

930
01:53:58,198 --> 01:54:00,393
Listen carefully to what I say, Rohit...
- No.

931
01:54:00,633 --> 01:54:02,066
Instead, watch what
I'm going to show you.

932
01:54:33,032 --> 01:54:35,626
Everyone's laughing at you, Rohit.
Let's go.

933
01:54:35,869 --> 01:54:38,463
No way! I'll give it another try.

934
01:54:40,206 --> 01:54:40,797
Move.

935
01:54:46,546 --> 01:54:49,640
Rohit, this is no child's play.
C'mon.

936
01:54:51,084 --> 01:54:52,517
All right. I'm leaving!

937
01:54:54,420 --> 01:54:54,977
One more try.

938
01:55:51,444 --> 01:55:54,880
"Nothing's raw, nothing's ripe..."

939
01:55:55,114 --> 01:55:58,208
"all that happens is part of the game"

940
01:56:12,932 --> 01:56:16,026
"Curtains drop, curtains rise..."

941
01:56:16,269 --> 01:56:19,363
"things which haven't changed,
do change"

942
01:56:19,939 --> 01:56:23,033
"For nothing's raw,
nothing's ripe..."

943
01:56:23,276 --> 01:56:26,541
"all that happens is
part of the game"

944
01:57:03,483 --> 01:57:10,389
"Why is the grass..."
"always greener on the other side?"

945
01:57:10,556 --> 01:57:17,655
"Why does one not appreciate..."
"what one has?"

946
01:57:18,331 --> 01:57:21,789
"The heart always
speaks the truth..."

947
01:57:22,035 --> 01:57:25,937
"but why does one
not hear what the heart says?"

948
01:57:27,240 --> 01:57:31,108
"Does not hear, does not hear"

949
01:57:31,844 --> 01:57:34,108
"Nothing's raw, nothing's ripe..."

950
01:57:34,347 --> 01:57:37,942
"all that happens
is part of the game"

951
01:58:16,222 --> 01:58:17,655
"Come..."

952
01:58:18,057 --> 01:58:19,319
"take a look..."

953
01:58:19,892 --> 01:58:23,157
"and give it a thought"

954
01:58:23,396 --> 01:58:24,988
"Think about it..."

955
01:58:25,231 --> 01:58:29,998
"and consider what I say"

956
01:58:31,070 --> 01:58:33,334
"That which appears small,
isn't really small..."

957
01:58:34,574 --> 01:58:39,671
"there's something big about it"

958
01:58:39,879 --> 01:58:42,507
"There is something big about it"

959
01:58:43,382 --> 01:58:46,442
"Nothing's raw, nothing's ripe..."

960
01:58:47,120 --> 01:58:50,385
"all that happens is part of the game"

961
01:59:04,904 --> 01:59:07,998
"Curtains drop, curtains rise..."

962
01:59:08,241 --> 01:59:11,176
"things which haven't changed,
do change"

963
01:59:11,410 --> 01:59:15,176
"For nothing's raw,
nothing's ripe..."

964
01:59:15,414 --> 01:59:19,009
"all that happens is
part of the game"

965
02:00:14,874 --> 02:00:20,141
Well? Ripened a bit, haven't I?
- You, I...

966
02:00:21,047 --> 02:00:21,638
all this...?

967
02:00:26,085 --> 02:00:28,815
This is only the beginning.
Just wait and watch.

968
02:00:52,778 --> 02:00:54,211
This isn't meant for kids.

969
02:00:54,947 --> 02:00:57,040
If it bursts,
you run out of gas.

970
02:00:58,317 --> 02:01:00,808
We'll see who runs out of gas.
How about a match?

971
02:01:02,255 --> 02:01:05,019
All pepped up? - You'll know
after the match, sonny.

972
02:01:05,258 --> 02:01:07,522
Really? So let's have a match.
- What's the bet?

973
02:01:08,594 --> 02:01:09,026
The Hero Cup!

974
02:01:09,762 --> 02:01:12,856
Alongwith the Cup, whoever wins,
gets a kiss from Nisha.

975
02:01:27,113 --> 02:01:28,705
The two of us are playing
a basketball match.

976
02:01:28,948 --> 02:01:31,041
You will kiss the one who wins.

977
02:01:32,151 --> 02:01:33,584
I'm not kissing Raj ever!

978
02:01:34,654 --> 02:01:37,214
You will kiss me, won't you?
- That is, if you win!

979
02:01:37,657 --> 02:01:40,421
There's a huge difference between
dance and basketball, Rohit.

980
02:01:40,660 --> 02:01:41,752
You can't win it on your own!

981
02:01:42,328 --> 02:01:45,593
You've challenged him without a team
and invited trouble!

982
02:01:45,831 --> 02:01:48,265
Now you're going to lose and Raj
is going to give you a thrashing!

983
02:01:49,669 --> 02:01:51,102
Why? You guys are my team.

984
02:01:51,504 --> 02:01:55,270
We? They're so tall,
and we're so short!

985
02:01:55,508 --> 02:01:57,271
We can't even manage a proper jump.

986
02:01:57,510 --> 02:01:57,942
Look here.

987
02:02:02,014 --> 02:02:02,878
Wow!

988
02:02:08,487 --> 02:02:11,422
Today's match is a
strange one indeed.

989
02:02:13,826 --> 02:02:16,590
Have been challenged by
Rohit Mehra's team.

990
02:02:16,829 --> 02:02:18,763
His team is called the Pandavas.

991
02:02:23,502 --> 02:02:24,264
What do I see?

992
02:02:24,503 --> 02:02:26,937
Is this the team of the Pandavas
or is it their children?

993
02:02:34,513 --> 02:02:35,275
Don't move, okay?

994
02:02:50,229 --> 02:02:51,821
There goes the referee's whistle
and the match begins.

995
02:02:52,064 --> 02:02:53,929
Ball has been tossed up.

996
02:02:54,166 --> 02:02:57,465
Raj Saxena, taking advantage of his
height, tosses the ball to a team mate.

997
02:02:57,903 --> 02:03:00,963
The Kasauli Tigers pass the ball
to each other, across halfline...

998
02:03:01,207 --> 02:03:04,836
here's another pass,
and another to Raj Saxena...

999
02:03:05,077 --> 02:03:09,343
Raj Saxena advances, but Rohit Mehra,
takes the ball away from Raj Saxena...

1000
02:03:09,915 --> 02:03:10,847
maneouvres the ball
from between his legs...

1001
02:03:11,083 --> 02:03:15,349
advances towards the D, jumps up and...
it's a basket!

1002
02:03:21,894 --> 02:03:24,328
The match gets underway again
with the referee's whistle.

1003
02:03:24,730 --> 02:03:28,496
Monty passes the ball to Raj Saxena
who moves forward and this pass...

1004
02:03:28,734 --> 02:03:30,827
but Rohit Mehra snatches
the ball midway and...

1005
02:03:31,070 --> 02:03:36,838
Moves forward, eavdes,
jumps and basket.

1006
02:03:39,078 --> 02:03:41,410
The excitement is mounting,
the applause is getting louder...

1007
02:03:42,081 --> 02:03:43,378
and the scoreboard ticks on.

1008
02:03:46,952 --> 02:03:49,887
The match begins again. The ball
is with the Kasauli Tigers...

1009
02:03:50,122 --> 02:03:52,556
Raj Saxena gets hold
of the ball and...

1010
02:03:52,792 --> 02:03:56,489
Rohit Mehra knocks it out the danger area,
passes it to a team member...

1011
02:03:56,729 --> 02:03:59,323
he once again takes charge of the ball,
advances towards the basket...

1012
02:03:59,565 --> 02:04:03,160
he jumps up and this is
the third basket!

1013
02:04:11,977 --> 02:04:13,069
Let's surround Rohit.

1014
02:04:16,582 --> 02:04:18,641
The ball is with PCB and
the match begins.

1015
02:04:18,884 --> 02:04:20,317
The ball is with Kasuali Tigers.

1016
02:04:20,553 --> 02:04:23,181
And Rohit Mehra is surrounded by
members of the Kasauli Tigers.

1017
02:04:23,456 --> 02:04:26,823
Jumping over the little boy,
Raj Saxena moves forward...

1018
02:04:27,059 --> 02:04:28,549
and this is a basket!

1019
02:04:28,794 --> 02:04:30,455
This is the first scoring point
from the Kasauli Tigers...

1020
02:04:30,729 --> 02:04:32,959
much to the delight
of their supporters.

1021
02:04:33,566 --> 02:04:36,228
The little boys pass the ball
to one another...

1022
02:04:36,469 --> 02:04:38,562
but Rohit Mehra's still surrounded,
not being able to do much...

1023
02:04:38,804 --> 02:04:39,566
and the kids are utterly helpless.

1024
02:04:39,805 --> 02:04:43,241
The ball's now with Raj Saxena and...
that's a basket!

1025
02:04:44,310 --> 02:04:47,074
Raj Saxena and his team rejoice.
The children are disappointed.

1026
02:04:47,313 --> 02:04:53,252
Rohit Mehra is still surrounded and
the ball's with Raj Saxena...

1027
02:04:53,519 --> 02:04:55,783
and what do I see...?
Rohit Mehra falls to the ground!

1028
02:04:56,021 --> 02:04:58,956
Whether he fell or was made to fall,
Raj Saxena takes advantage and...

1029
02:04:59,191 --> 02:05:00,818
that's a basket!

1030
02:05:01,060 --> 02:05:06,999
The children protest. They want a foul
called, but the referee's unmoved.

1031
02:05:07,399 --> 02:05:09,890
The scores are now even.

1032
02:05:10,803 --> 02:05:15,570
The ball is now with the little boys,
with Rohit Mehra...

1033
02:05:15,808 --> 02:05:19,335
he makes a pass which takes the ball
to another member of his team...

1034
02:05:19,578 --> 02:05:20,738
who's trying to jump high...

1035
02:05:20,980 --> 02:05:22,504
surrounded by the tall
Kasauli Tigers players...

1036
02:05:22,748 --> 02:05:25,444
there's little the boys can do.
The ball is with the Kasauli Tigers...

1037
02:05:25,718 --> 02:05:27,811
and here's another basket!

1038
02:05:30,289 --> 02:05:34,453
Why aren't you guys jumping?
- We're trying, but we can't jump.

1039
02:05:36,562 --> 02:05:40,794
The Kasauli Tigers are getting
more and more aggressive...

1040
02:05:41,033 --> 02:05:44,560
and Raj Saxena moves forward
to score another basket!

1041
02:05:45,104 --> 02:05:46,867
The score is increasing.

1042
02:05:47,606 --> 02:05:50,575
One basket after another...
and here's another!

1043
02:05:51,343 --> 02:05:55,905
Raj Saxena and his players now
seem to be toying with the kids.

1044
02:05:56,148 --> 02:05:58,639
The kids are all jumping around...

1045
02:05:58,918 --> 02:06:01,819
but Raj Saxena is scoring baskets
from where he stands!

1046
02:06:02,087 --> 02:06:05,454
It appears as if it isn't a match,
as if the Pandavas...

1047
02:06:05,691 --> 02:06:06,680
have been invited for
a practise session!

1048
02:06:06,959 --> 02:06:08,859
Here's another basket!

1049
02:06:13,198 --> 02:06:15,462
That whistle signals the half-time.

1050
02:06:19,138 --> 02:06:23,302
Jadoo... what's happening?
Why aren't we being able to jump?

1051
02:06:23,542 --> 02:06:24,474
Sunlight.

1052
02:06:25,544 --> 02:06:25,976
Sunlight?

1053
02:06:31,216 --> 02:06:32,649
Jadoo gets his energy from sunlight.

1054
02:06:33,586 --> 02:06:36,521
Unless he gets sunlight,
he can do nothing.

1055
02:06:39,425 --> 02:06:42,019
You mean, if there is no sunlight,
Jadoo can do nothing?

1056
02:06:42,595 --> 02:06:43,357
So what are we going to do?

1057
02:06:46,765 --> 02:06:50,030
Lord Krishna, please do something.

1058
02:06:53,439 --> 02:06:57,705
With the referee's whistle, play in
the second half has begun again.

1059
02:06:57,943 --> 02:07:00,207
The ball's in the air, going once again
to a player of the Kasauli Tigers.

1060
02:07:00,379 --> 02:07:06,477
He moves forward, passes the ball
...once again comes into Raj Saxena.

1061
02:07:17,329 --> 02:07:20,526
Kasauli Tigers continue the game
without bothering about Rohit.

1062
02:07:20,766 --> 02:07:22,028
Children's team are making a sincere
effort to give them a competition.

1063
02:07:22,267 --> 02:07:25,259
But they're unable to manage
the tall Players.

1064
02:07:25,504 --> 02:07:27,096
Kasauli Tigers are surging
ahead in the game...

1065
02:07:27,373 --> 02:07:31,207
But Rohit snatches the ball mid-way and
passes it to young team mate.

1066
02:07:31,443 --> 02:07:37,040
This child flies into the air,
passes the ball to another boy...

1067
02:07:37,282 --> 02:07:39,477
One child flies high into the air
and grabs the ball...

1068
02:07:40,519 --> 02:07:42,214
...ls this a twist in the match or
am I getting unwell?

1069
02:07:42,488 --> 02:07:44,547
Whatever happening here is amazing,
ladies & gentleman.

1070
02:07:44,823 --> 02:07:46,984
Spectators are stunned.

1071
02:07:49,395 --> 02:07:50,919
Jadoo... Didi... Jadoo!

1072
02:07:52,665 --> 02:07:54,690
Match resumes once again and
the ball us with Kasauli Tigers...

1073
02:07:54,933 --> 02:07:56,195
Raj Sexena is moving forward
with the ball...

1074
02:07:57,169 --> 02:08:00,297
Three Kids fly high into the air
and pass the ball...

1075
02:08:00,539 --> 02:08:05,567
...to Rohit Mehra who flies high
into the air and baskets it.

1076
02:08:12,284 --> 02:08:14,548
Blessed is the one who sings
glories of the Lord.

1077
02:08:14,820 --> 02:08:16,879
Praise the Lord!

1078
02:08:17,489 --> 02:08:21,892
The spectators are ecstatic.
The match moves on.

1079
02:08:22,327 --> 02:08:24,761
The Kasauli Tigers move forward,
passing the ball to each other...

1080
02:08:24,997 --> 02:08:26,430
they are surrounding the opponents...

1081
02:08:26,665 --> 02:08:33,537
but this boy flies ahead, picks up the
ball & passes it to Rohit Mehra...

1082
02:08:33,772 --> 02:08:34,932
and Rohit Mehra scores another basket!

1083
02:08:39,645 --> 02:08:44,446
I'm not having to look down much,
I can see it happening right up here

1084
02:08:44,683 --> 02:08:48,779
The Kasauli Tigers are falling apart
and the children refuse to come down.

1085
02:08:49,054 --> 02:08:52,820
They're scoring the baskets
right up there in the air...

1086
02:08:53,192 --> 02:08:55,990
teasing the grown ups
all the way.

1087
02:08:58,230 --> 02:09:00,755
Match is getting existing. I couldn't
imagine this match would take this cause.

1088
02:09:14,346 --> 02:09:16,211
This match sure is
getting exciting.

1089
02:09:16,548 --> 02:09:22,384
Looks like the little kids are going
to wear out the Kasauli Tigers.

1090
02:09:23,055 --> 02:09:26,821
Raj Saxena is exhausted and the kids
help themselves to another basket

1091
02:09:27,459 --> 02:09:29,859
They're no kids, they've turned
out to be everyone's fathers.

1092
02:09:30,095 --> 02:09:34,828
They're scoring at will and
the score is way ahead.

1093
02:09:36,068 --> 02:09:38,002
25 seconds to go and we must see
which team clinches the match.

1094
02:09:38,237 --> 02:09:41,172
The scores are 48 and 49 points.

1095
02:09:41,406 --> 02:09:45,103
Now we've to see which
teams wins the hero cup.

1096
02:09:46,879 --> 02:09:49,143
Match resumes and the ball is
once again with the Kasauli Tigers.

1097
02:09:49,381 --> 02:09:52,077
...They're holding the ball firmly &
pressing it cautiously to team-mates.

1098
02:09:52,351 --> 02:09:53,010
...And appear determined... not
let the ball reach the opponent.

1099
02:09:53,452 --> 02:09:57,354
...Ball reaches Raj Saxena an
experienced player.

1100
02:09:57,623 --> 02:10:00,217
...Moving forward he throws
the ball into the basket.

1101
02:10:00,459 --> 02:10:02,051
...But Rohit Mehra once again
gets hold of the ball...

1102
02:10:03,362 --> 02:10:05,626
Spectators excitment is running high,
just 10 seconds move to the final whistle.

1103
02:10:15,240 --> 02:10:16,605
Final scores is 50:49.

1104
02:10:40,299 --> 02:10:43,962
I see the Kasauli Tigers,
dejected, heads hanging...

1105
02:10:44,369 --> 02:10:48,635
And the little are moving forward in
glory... to receive the Hero Cup.

1106
02:10:48,941 --> 02:10:52,308
Rohit is being presenting the with
Hero Cup. Give them a big hand.

1107
02:10:53,679 --> 02:10:55,271
Ladies & Gentleman little Pandavas
have won the Hero Cup...

1108
02:10:55,514 --> 02:10:58,677
There's another reward with the Cup.
The Hero Honda motorbike!

1109
02:11:02,955 --> 02:11:05,355
Not time for the kiss yet.
One more victory to achieve.

1110
02:11:07,326 --> 02:11:07,849
Get the Hero his Honda!

1111
02:11:12,764 --> 02:11:15,198
How did the kids start flying?

1112
02:11:16,168 --> 02:11:16,930
Something is surely fishy.

1113
02:11:17,836 --> 02:11:19,303
We must find out from the kids.

1114
02:11:20,005 --> 02:11:22,439
What are you talking about, Harbans?
- It's true.

1115
02:11:22,908 --> 02:11:25,342
My son is the butt of jokes
among his friends.

1116
02:11:29,114 --> 02:11:30,945
And it's all happening
because of your daughter.

1117
02:11:31,350 --> 02:11:34,786
I understand that, Harbans. I did my best
to make Nisha see reason. But...

1118
02:11:37,222 --> 02:11:40,282
Are you telling me that if Nisha
decides to marry Rohit...

1119
02:11:40,726 --> 02:11:45,663
you will give her hand in Rohit's,
despite knowing he's mad?

1120
02:11:46,899 --> 02:11:48,491
Just calling someone mad won't do!

1121
02:11:50,068 --> 02:11:52,832
The word "mad" doesn't make it clear
what kind of a madman someone is...

1122
02:11:53,071 --> 02:11:55,835
and what category of madnes
she belongs to

1123
02:11:56,108 --> 02:12:00,442
For example, schizophrenia is madness.
So are megalomania, obsession...

1124
02:12:00,679 --> 02:12:04,945
psychopathy and mental imbalance.
And there's also plain madness itself

1125
02:12:05,183 --> 02:12:06,650
And madness has no limits.

1126
02:12:06,885 --> 02:12:08,443
Mad, idiot, crazy...
are names for the mad.

1127
02:12:08,720 --> 02:12:09,982
So are crack, cuckoo and dimwit.

1128
02:12:10,222 --> 02:12:14,124
There are people who the world thinks
are mad, but they aren't really mad.

1129
02:12:14,393 --> 02:12:17,829
And there are those whose madness is
not obvious, although they are mad!

1130
02:12:18,063 --> 02:12:20,998
In short, this is a small
summary on... madness!

1131
02:12:23,902 --> 02:12:27,167
Why have you stood up?
Please remain seated.

1132
02:12:33,078 --> 02:12:35,842
As I was saying, there are
several signs of madness.

1133
02:12:37,316 --> 02:12:39,841
To shake your legs in a state of
nervousness is also a sign of madness.

1134
02:12:41,954 --> 02:12:44,013
And you folks think I'm mad!

1135
02:12:46,959 --> 02:12:49,052
That's because I'm madly in love
with your daughter.

1136
02:13:32,804 --> 02:13:33,566
"It has indeed happened"

1137
02:13:34,473 --> 02:13:35,235
"Your touch has started it all"

1138
02:13:36,308 --> 02:13:38,742
"I'm slain"

1139
02:13:38,977 --> 02:13:42,242
"What have I done to myself
in a state of ecstasy?"

1140
02:14:05,303 --> 02:14:07,567
"Our pining..."

1141
02:14:07,973 --> 02:14:11,238
"brings about a cloudburst."

1142
02:14:51,917 --> 02:14:55,148
"The touch was but an excuse..."

1143
02:14:55,620 --> 02:14:58,646
"I feel you all over"

1144
02:15:03,862 --> 02:15:06,797
"Our love was meant to be eternal..."

1145
02:15:07,365 --> 02:15:10,300
"and today, I've told you"

1146
02:15:15,440 --> 02:15:22,471
"I admire you. I know you
for what you are today"

1147
02:15:22,714 --> 02:15:25,478
"You sure have turned out
to be a true lover"

1148
02:15:25,750 --> 02:15:27,479
"My secret...
- I had discovered".

1149
02:15:27,752 --> 02:15:29,310
"Your fair arms...
- Why're you grabbing?"

1150
02:15:29,754 --> 02:15:33,155
"It sends a tremour through my heart"

1151
02:15:34,259 --> 02:15:35,021
"It's has indeed happened"

1152
02:15:35,260 --> 02:15:37,023
"Your touch has started it all"

1153
02:15:37,262 --> 02:15:40,356
"I'm slain"

1154
02:15:40,765 --> 02:15:44,030
"What have I done to myself?"

1155
02:15:44,269 --> 02:15:51,038
"Our yearning..."

1156
02:15:51,276 --> 02:15:58,375
"makes the cloud shower again"

1157
02:16:31,449 --> 02:16:34,885
"I tried to prevent my heart..."

1158
02:16:35,153 --> 02:16:38,554
"it could not be held back.
No, it couldn't"

1159
02:16:43,495 --> 02:16:50,765
"At what you did..."
"it went out to you"

1160
02:16:55,440 --> 02:17:02,209
"I wonder what I did and
what that did to you..."

1161
02:17:02,514 --> 02:17:05,381
"it brings a smile to our face"

1162
02:17:05,650 --> 02:17:07,208
"Through days... - And nights..."

1163
02:17:07,485 --> 02:17:09,419
"together... - We shall talk of love"

1164
02:17:09,654 --> 02:17:12,919
"We have reined in our love"

1165
02:17:13,992 --> 02:17:14,924
"It has indeed happened"

1166
02:17:15,160 --> 02:17:16,593
"Your touch has started it all"

1167
02:17:17,996 --> 02:17:20,089
"Our pining..."

1168
02:17:20,332 --> 02:17:23,768
"brings about a cloudburst"

1169
02:17:24,836 --> 02:17:25,928
"It has indeed happened"

1170
02:17:26,671 --> 02:17:27,603
"Your touch has started it all"

1171
02:17:27,839 --> 02:17:30,933
"I'm slain"

1172
02:17:31,509 --> 02:17:34,774
"What have I done to myself
in a state of esctacy?"

1173
02:17:35,013 --> 02:17:38,449
"The cloud showers love again"

1174
02:18:01,673 --> 02:18:04,938
Why've you stopped? You were jumping
around so much the other day.

1175
02:18:05,510 --> 02:18:07,444
Jump over us again.

1176
02:18:10,248 --> 02:18:12,944
What are you looking down at?
What's in that bag?

1177
02:18:13,885 --> 02:18:17,446
Run! There's no sunlight!
Jadoo needs to be saved!

1178
02:19:42,640 --> 02:19:44,904
Sir, I've seen it with my own eyes.

1179
02:21:02,754 --> 02:21:03,812
Check what's in the bag.

1180
02:21:23,107 --> 02:21:23,539
Come and take a look.

1181
02:23:16,054 --> 02:23:18,614
Go... go home.

1182
02:23:22,894 --> 02:23:24,486
But how did you escape, Jadoo?

1183
02:23:36,240 --> 02:23:39,334
It was a narrow escape!
- You were amazing, I say.

1184
02:23:45,083 --> 02:23:46,175
What happened?

1185
02:23:46,951 --> 02:23:48,509
Is Jadoo here, Ma?
- Yes, he's inside.

1186
02:23:54,292 --> 02:23:56,726
Rohit... what happened?

1187
02:23:57,695 --> 02:23:59,560
The way Inspector Khan
was looking at me...

1188
02:24:00,732 --> 02:24:02,165
I'm sure he suspects me.

1189
02:24:03,901 --> 02:24:05,493
We'll have to hide Jadoo
somewhere else.

1190
02:24:05,737 --> 02:24:08,331
Let's hide him in my house.
My parents are away.

1191
02:24:09,741 --> 02:24:13,006
No, my house should be right.
No one will ever imagine...

1192
02:24:13,244 --> 02:24:15,337
that Jadoo could be in District
magistrate's friend's house.

1193
02:24:15,647 --> 02:24:17,842
For how long will you keep
hiding him like this?

1194
02:24:18,116 --> 02:24:20,346
He's bound to be discovered some day.
- No.

1195
02:24:21,686 --> 02:24:24,849
I'll take Jadoo away
to some other town.

1196
02:24:25,790 --> 02:24:27,849
Once the police start
looking for him...

1197
02:24:28,126 --> 02:24:31,892
you won't be able to hide Jadoo
anywhere in the world.

1198
02:24:32,296 --> 02:24:33,388
So what are we to do, Ma?

1199
02:24:35,500 --> 02:24:39,061
There's only one way of
saving his life, Rohit.

1200
02:24:41,172 --> 02:24:46,906
Send him back to where
he has come from.

1201
02:24:47,145 --> 02:24:50,239
No, Ma! No one can
separate Jadoo from me.

1202
02:24:51,315 --> 02:24:54,284
As long as I live, no one can
even touch him.

1203
02:24:54,519 --> 02:24:58,785
Rohit, auntie is right.

1204
02:25:00,024 --> 02:25:02,549
You can't take on the world
on your own.

1205
02:25:06,631 --> 02:25:09,725
Jadoo will not go.

1206
02:25:18,710 --> 02:25:22,237
Everyone's going to feel sad
at the parting, Jadoo.

1207
02:25:22,480 --> 02:25:26,746
But it's in your interests to return.

1208
02:25:28,019 --> 02:25:33,787
If Jadoo goes...
all powers will also go away.

1209
02:25:40,031 --> 02:25:40,793
What does that mean?

1210
02:25:45,770 --> 02:25:46,794
It means...

1211
02:25:47,038 --> 02:25:53,466
all the powers that he has given me
will go away with him.

1212
02:26:15,366 --> 02:26:16,458
Don't worry about me, Jadoo.

1213
02:26:17,769 --> 02:26:21,637
I'll live the way I used to.

1214
02:26:28,880 --> 02:26:36,309
Go, Rohit. Before it's too late.

1215
02:26:44,162 --> 02:26:45,527
We're going to miss you, Jadoo.

1216
02:26:58,776 --> 02:27:00,038
What's the matter, Rohit?

1217
02:27:02,213 --> 02:27:03,145
There's no response, Ma.

1218
02:27:10,421 --> 02:27:14,016
We know, the alien from another planet
is with you.

1219
02:27:17,094 --> 02:27:19,028
Hand it over to us.

1220
02:27:25,603 --> 02:27:28,367
We have surrounded your house
from all sides.

1221
02:27:32,276 --> 02:27:36,713
Till the count of ten, if you do not
turn it over to us...

1222
02:27:37,281 --> 02:27:39,715
we'll launch an attack on your house.

1223
02:27:43,988 --> 02:27:44,920
One.

1224
02:27:47,658 --> 02:27:48,750
Two.

1225
02:27:49,660 --> 02:27:51,252
Jadoo, do something!

1226
02:27:52,830 --> 02:27:53,922
Sunlight.

1227
02:27:54,165 --> 02:27:55,427
Three.

1228
02:27:58,903 --> 02:28:00,097
Four.

1229
02:28:03,774 --> 02:28:04,706
They're responding, Ma!

1230
02:28:08,779 --> 02:28:09,541
Five.

1231
02:28:13,317 --> 02:28:14,045
Six.

1232
02:29:24,388 --> 02:29:28,290
Rohit!

1233
02:29:28,960 --> 02:29:32,828
Rohit, hand it over to us.
- Never!

1234
02:29:33,064 --> 02:29:36,659
Do not compel us! Else, we'll have
to use force against you.

1235
02:29:38,235 --> 02:29:41,830
Do anything you want to!
I'm not handing him over to you!

1236
02:29:42,073 --> 02:29:42,835
Snatch it from him!

1237
02:29:58,456 --> 02:29:59,514
Leave my son alone!

1238
02:30:07,298 --> 02:30:08,060
Leave him.

1239
02:31:52,002 --> 02:31:54,436
Khan speaking.
We shall be there very soon.

1240
02:31:59,243 --> 02:32:03,737
I will not let Jadoo go.
I will not, let Jadoo go.

1241
02:32:06,750 --> 02:32:08,684
Ma, where's Jadoo?

1242
02:32:09,253 --> 02:32:10,982
They've taken him away.

1243
02:32:11,255 --> 02:32:12,813
Where to? - I'll tell you.

1244
02:32:13,757 --> 02:32:15,019
Yes, me.

1245
02:32:16,093 --> 02:32:18,687
I have never seen so much
love for a friend.

1246
02:32:19,597 --> 02:32:22,031
They're taking your friend to Delhi,
and from there to America.

1247
02:32:23,267 --> 02:32:29,866
Rohit, this is the time
to repay Jadoo's favours.

1248
02:32:30,107 --> 02:32:37,377
Go, save him and prove it that humanity
still exists in the world.

1249
02:32:38,182 --> 02:32:39,615
Go Rohit.

1250
02:35:08,732 --> 02:35:09,994
Hurry up! Follow him!

1251
02:35:26,283 --> 02:35:27,011
You people?

1252
02:35:29,286 --> 02:35:30,014
Jadoo?

1253
02:35:36,293 --> 02:35:37,055
Go fast, man.

1254
02:35:43,300 --> 02:35:43,891
C'mon!

1255
02:36:10,794 --> 02:36:13,388
You? Where's Rohit?

1256
02:36:13,630 --> 02:36:16,895
You won't find him.

1257
02:38:26,497 --> 02:38:30,524
Go, Jadoo.
They're waiting for you.

1258
02:38:57,661 --> 02:39:00,528
Thank you.

1259
02:40:32,956 --> 02:40:35,720
"Rohit Mehra in police custody"

1260
02:40:38,128 --> 02:40:40,221
"Special Court to deliver verdict
on Rohit Mehra's fate today"

1261
02:40:47,304 --> 02:40:51,400
This is Zee news correspondent
reporting from Kasauli...

1262
02:40:51,642 --> 02:40:54,736
where the special court yesterday
acquitted Rohit Mehra...

1263
02:40:54,978 --> 02:40:57,913
on the grounds that
he is mentally abnormal...

1264
02:40:58,148 --> 02:41:02,346
and today, the citizens of Kasauli
are felicitating Rohit Mehra...

1265
02:41:02,786 --> 02:41:06,187
for setting a rare example
of humanity and friendship...

1266
02:41:06,456 --> 02:41:12,019
in helping an alien, whom he considered
his friend, go back to his own world.

1267
02:41:12,295 --> 02:41:15,389
Let's all felicitate Rohit Mehra.

1268
02:41:34,351 --> 02:41:37,411
See, auntie? Rohit said
he'd make it big some day.

1269
02:41:37,688 --> 02:41:39,121
And he's become such a big man today.

1270
02:42:10,353 --> 02:42:12,287
I know what you're thinking about.

1271
02:42:14,357 --> 02:42:16,791
Jadoo has taken away the powers
he had given you.

1272
02:42:19,029 --> 02:42:20,792
Not my love.

1273
02:42:26,770 --> 02:42:27,964
You had become one hell of a hero.

1274
02:42:30,540 --> 02:42:31,632
What're you looking at?

1275
02:42:32,042 --> 02:42:35,478
He's gone, because of whom
you had changed.

1276
02:42:35,712 --> 02:42:37,475
Now kick the ball and show.

1277
02:42:41,418 --> 02:42:42,476
Let's go.

1278
02:42:44,921 --> 02:42:47,981
Yes, yes, take him and make him
wear your bangles.

1279
02:43:03,907 --> 02:43:05,636
Rohit, look! The ball is
flying in the air!

1280
02:43:08,712 --> 02:43:09,644
I can't see.

1281
02:43:20,090 --> 02:43:25,187
Now I can see clearly!

1282
02:43:25,428 --> 02:43:27,362
Looks like Jadoo has given
your powers back to you.

1283
02:43:29,933 --> 02:43:30,524
Look there...

1284
02:43:38,508 --> 02:43:40,169
Thank you, Jadoo.
