1
00:01:06,101 --> 00:01:08,490
Joe Blake and Terry Collins...

2
00:01:08,532 --> 00:01:09,776
this is Lieutenant McCormick...

3
00:01:09,813 --> 00:01:11,984
of the Los Angeles
Police Department.

4
00:01:12,853 --> 00:01:16,301
Put down your weapons
and come out of the bank...

5
00:01:16,342 --> 00:01:18,164
with your hands in the air.

6
00:01:18,774 --> 00:01:20,181
One last big heist.

7
00:01:20,214 --> 00:01:21,588
What a great idea.

8
00:01:21,622 --> 00:01:23,761
Yeah, Joe knows best.

9
00:01:23,798 --> 00:01:26,733
Yes, sirree, Joe knows
exactly what he's doing...

10
00:01:26,774 --> 00:01:27,985
exactly what he's doing.

11
00:01:28,023 --> 00:01:29,300
And what does Joe get me?

12
00:01:29,335 --> 00:01:31,408
Stuck in a bank
called the Alamo...

13
00:01:31,447 --> 00:01:33,269
surrounded by the entire
Los Angeles Police Department.

14
00:01:33,303 --> 00:01:34,252
Look out there.

15
00:01:34,904 --> 00:01:36,398
Remember now, people...

16
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:37,846
these guys haven't been
prone to violence yet...

17
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,222
in any of these incidents.

18
00:01:39,255 --> 00:01:41,590
So everybody just stay
real calm, all right?

19
00:01:41,624 --> 00:01:43,861
Joe Blake and Terry Collins
have finally met their match.

20
00:01:43,897 --> 00:01:45,391
l think they're running
out of luck very quickly.

21
00:01:45,432 --> 00:01:46,709
They're gonna need
more tricks up their sleeve...

22
00:01:46,744 --> 00:01:47,672
than Siegfried and Roy...

23
00:01:47,704 --> 00:01:49,111
if they think they're gonna get
out of this one.

24
00:01:49,145 --> 00:01:50,072
lf you're just tuning in,
we're in front...

25
00:01:50,105 --> 00:01:51,861
of the Alamo Savings and Loan
right here in Century City.

26
00:01:51,897 --> 00:01:53,686
The place looks like a war zone.

27
00:01:53,721 --> 00:01:55,696
The, uh, the troops are
moving in here.

28
00:01:55,737 --> 00:01:57,330
The SWATteam is moving in.
The helicopters are moving in.

29
00:01:57,978 --> 00:02:00,825
Lao-tzu says that
even the softest of things...

30
00:02:00,858 --> 00:02:03,542
can pass through a horse
like invisible water.

31
00:02:03,578 --> 00:02:04,506
Thank you...

32
00:02:04,538 --> 00:02:06,994
for that completely useless
bit of information, Joe.

33
00:02:07,035 --> 00:02:08,693
You know what
your problem is, huh?

34
00:02:08,731 --> 00:02:09,713
My problem?

35
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:11,129
Yeah. l'm trapped like a rat!

36
00:02:11,994 --> 00:02:13,271
Destined for an early grave.

37
00:02:14,107 --> 00:02:15,220
Kate Wheeler.

38
00:02:15,259 --> 00:02:16,666
You remember Kate.

39
00:02:17,659 --> 00:02:18,739
Traitor...

40
00:02:19,227 --> 00:02:20,155
liar...

41
00:02:20,187 --> 00:02:22,042
queen of double cross...

42
00:02:22,555 --> 00:02:23,483
empress of deceit.

43
00:02:23,516 --> 00:02:26,385
Hey, duchess, OK,
l get your point, all right?

44
00:02:26,428 --> 00:02:28,152
Oh, do you, Joe?

45
00:02:28,188 --> 00:02:29,399
Do you really?

46
00:02:29,436 --> 00:02:30,614
Because as l recall...

47
00:02:30,652 --> 00:02:31,580
l remember warning you...

48
00:02:31,613 --> 00:02:33,435
in the strongest
language possible...

49
00:02:33,469 --> 00:02:35,444
that taking on
a full-time hostage...

50
00:02:35,486 --> 00:02:36,795
was an error
of epic proportions.

51
00:02:36,829 --> 00:02:37,757
We had no choice, OK?

52
00:02:37,789 --> 00:02:38,717
Yes, we did.

53
00:02:38,749 --> 00:02:40,506
Shoot her and bury her body
in the woods.

54
00:02:40,542 --> 00:02:41,470
That was a choice.

55
00:02:41,502 --> 00:02:42,647
Hey, you brought her in, OK?

56
00:02:42,686 --> 00:02:43,831
l recall that!

57
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:44,950
You know what?
lf we'd have let her go...

58
00:02:44,991 --> 00:02:46,813
she'd have gone
right to the cops, OK?

59
00:02:46,846 --> 00:02:48,221
Joe, look outside.

60
00:02:48,254 --> 00:02:49,334
She did.

61
00:02:50,814 --> 00:02:53,019
That's exactly what she did.

62
00:02:53,055 --> 00:02:54,070
Kate Wheeler's gonna get...

63
00:02:54,111 --> 00:02:56,380
the thanks
of a grateful nation...

64
00:02:56,415 --> 00:02:58,171
not to mention a sizable reward.

65
00:03:01,727 --> 00:03:03,615
We've got shots fired
in the location.

66
00:03:12,929 --> 00:03:14,752
Good evening, everybody.
l'm Darren Head...

67
00:03:14,785 --> 00:03:17,306
and tonight we have
an incredible story for you.

68
00:03:17,345 --> 00:03:19,996
lt's a story that's part
soap opera, part crime drama...

69
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,724
a story of betrayal and greed.

70
00:03:21,762 --> 00:03:23,191
lt's part Bonnie and Clyde...

71
00:03:23,234 --> 00:03:24,696
it's part Barnum & Bailey.

72
00:03:24,738 --> 00:03:27,007
lt's the story of Joe Blake
and Terry Collins...

73
00:03:27,042 --> 00:03:28,635
the most successful
bank robbers...

74
00:03:28,674 --> 00:03:30,714
in the history
of the United States.

75
00:03:30,755 --> 00:03:32,249
Now, shortly
before the bloody shootout...

76
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:33,403
that took their lives...

77
00:03:33,443 --> 00:03:34,937
l had the opportunity to
interviewthese men...

78
00:03:34,979 --> 00:03:36,026
in an exclusive interview...

79
00:03:36,067 --> 00:03:37,693
when they broke into my house...

80
00:03:37,731 --> 00:03:38,714
and by gunpoint...

81
00:03:38,756 --> 00:03:40,163
made me tell their story...

82
00:03:40,195 --> 00:03:41,123
from their point of view.

83
00:03:41,156 --> 00:03:42,366
Now, the reason
l bring this up...

84
00:03:42,403 --> 00:03:43,865
is that the footage
you're about to see...

85
00:03:43,908 --> 00:03:47,040
was shot on a home video camera
by my personal assistant Julio.

86
00:03:47,076 --> 00:03:48,800
So it's a little shaky
and a little wobbly...

87
00:03:48,836 --> 00:03:49,884
not exactly professional.

88
00:03:49,924 --> 00:03:51,746
Now, what happened in
the wide-ranging exchange is...

89
00:03:51,781 --> 00:03:54,464
Blake and Collins revealed to me
for the first time anywhere...

90
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:55,646
the inside story...

91
00:03:55,684 --> 00:03:57,757
of the daring robberies
that made them so famous.

92
00:03:57,797 --> 00:04:00,448
24 hours later,
Blake and Collins were dead...

93
00:04:00,485 --> 00:04:01,729
and we have an exclusive--

94
00:04:01,765 --> 00:04:03,140
OK. Again.

95
00:04:03,173 --> 00:04:06,207
24 hours later,
Blake and Collins were dead.

96
00:04:06,245 --> 00:04:08,667
So tonight
on a very special edition...

97
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,205
of ''Criminals at Large''...

98
00:04:10,246 --> 00:04:12,548
the inside story,
the true story...

99
00:04:12,582 --> 00:04:14,208
of the Sleepover Bandits.

100
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:16,541
And...fade to black.

101
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:17,957
That was great, guys.
We're gonna keep that one.

102
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:19,268
-All right.
-Cut it.

103
00:04:19,303 --> 00:04:20,514
We'll use that
with the ''B'' roll.

104
00:04:21,863 --> 00:04:23,073
Got it. Roll!

105
00:04:30,345 --> 00:04:31,457
Don't quit on me, brother.

106
00:04:34,825 --> 00:04:36,352
lt's ridiculous.

107
00:04:37,929 --> 00:04:39,106
lf it's not one thing,
it's another.

108
00:04:39,145 --> 00:04:41,479
lf it's not downright apathy,
it's just meanness.

109
00:04:41,514 --> 00:04:42,561
Total meanness.

110
00:04:43,593 --> 00:04:45,317
Can't get any support
from anybody.

111
00:04:47,242 --> 00:04:49,511
Nobody else has to
eat this crap like l do.

112
00:04:49,547 --> 00:04:51,521
You got to jab to spar, man.

113
00:04:54,827 --> 00:04:56,256
Hey, Joe.

114
00:04:56,299 --> 00:04:57,641
Joe...

115
00:04:57,675 --> 00:04:59,170
may l have a word
with you, please?

116
00:04:59,211 --> 00:05:00,138
Hey, Joe.

117
00:05:00,171 --> 00:05:02,375
lt's a violation
of my civil rights.

118
00:05:02,411 --> 00:05:03,721
That's what it is.

119
00:05:03,755 --> 00:05:05,348
Cruel and unusual punishment...

120
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:08,137
expressly forbidden
by the Constitution, you hear?

121
00:05:08,172 --> 00:05:10,725
Prison is supposed to be
cruel and unusual, Terry.

122
00:05:10,764 --> 00:05:12,139
That's the whole idea.

123
00:05:12,172 --> 00:05:13,634
That's not what
l'm talking about.

124
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,264
What are you talking about?

125
00:05:17,677 --> 00:05:18,692
Garlic.

126
00:05:18,733 --> 00:05:20,675
Warden Currier has banned
the sale...

127
00:05:20,717 --> 00:05:21,797
of fresh garlic
in the commissary...

128
00:05:21,838 --> 00:05:23,594
because he doesn't
like the smell.

129
00:05:23,629 --> 00:05:25,156
You see, Joe...

130
00:05:25,198 --> 00:05:27,434
it's like a--
it's a miracle drug.

131
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:29,958
High blood pressure
and arthritis...

132
00:05:29,998 --> 00:05:31,242
and cancer...

133
00:05:31,854 --> 00:05:33,163
emphysema...

134
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,573
allergies, anything.

135
00:05:34,607 --> 00:05:36,811
Garlic is the first line
of defense, always.

136
00:05:36,847 --> 00:05:38,189
Hold on one second, Mario.

137
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:40,100
You see what l'm saying?

138
00:05:42,767 --> 00:05:44,523
And l've got symptoms.

139
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,632
l don't care what
that doctor says.

140
00:05:48,175 --> 00:05:50,597
Maybe now's not a good time
to talk about garlic?

141
00:05:52,368 --> 00:05:53,742
Hey, Joe.

142
00:05:53,776 --> 00:05:55,598
You--you know,
don't worry about it.

143
00:05:55,633 --> 00:05:56,680
Once you come down
out of the ring...

144
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,022
don't do what l think
you're gonna do, please.

145
00:05:59,057 --> 00:06:00,715
You remember what l told you,
right, Joe?

146
00:06:00,753 --> 00:06:02,346
Don't--don't--
uh, don't do the, uh--

147
00:06:02,385 --> 00:06:03,847
You really chipped
my tooth, Mario.

148
00:06:05,201 --> 00:06:06,990
Joe, for God's sake.

149
00:06:07,025 --> 00:06:07,974
Joe.

150
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:15,282
Joe, wait.

151
00:06:15,314 --> 00:06:16,743
Joe, hey.

152
00:06:17,363 --> 00:06:19,534
Joe, anger management.

153
00:06:19,571 --> 00:06:21,611
Anger mana--Joe!

154
00:06:21,651 --> 00:06:22,993
Anger management!

155
00:06:23,028 --> 00:06:24,304
Joe.

156
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:25,681
Calm down.

157
00:06:25,715 --> 00:06:26,697
Breathe.

158
00:06:42,165 --> 00:06:43,474
You ever read the ''Tao''?

159
00:06:44,085 --> 00:06:45,100
l'm sorry?

160
00:06:46,326 --> 00:06:48,530
You know, the guy, uh, Lao...

161
00:06:48,565 --> 00:06:52,308
Lay, uh, Lo-wi...Lu...

162
00:06:52,342 --> 00:06:54,830
-Lao-tzu.
-There you go. Lao-tzu.

163
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:57,620
You know, Joe, l begged you
to stay out of the library.

164
00:06:57,654 --> 00:06:59,891
You begged me to work
on my anger management.

165
00:06:59,926 --> 00:07:01,999
Yeah, well,
medication's quicker.

166
00:07:03,287 --> 00:07:04,880
lt's much more effective.

167
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,669
You know what?

168
00:07:13,176 --> 00:07:15,631
l would like to sleep
in a comfortable bed tonight.

169
00:07:17,272 --> 00:07:19,182
l'd like to have me
a cheeseburger...

170
00:07:20,921 --> 00:07:22,099
french fries...

171
00:07:22,137 --> 00:07:24,504
a big old chocolate milk shake
for dinner.

172
00:07:25,465 --> 00:07:27,288
Ancient Chinese wisdom?

173
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:28,848
No. Just hungry.

174
00:07:28,889 --> 00:07:30,515
Hold up.

175
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:33,777
l definitely chipped my tooth.

176
00:07:34,939 --> 00:07:36,848
For the love of God...

177
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:39,574
does no one else hear
that infernal ringing?

178
00:07:40,891 --> 00:07:42,647
Oh, yeah, sure,
go ahead and laugh...

179
00:07:42,683 --> 00:07:44,887
but according
to the latest research...

180
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:46,582
tinnitus, which is what
they call it--

181
00:07:46,619 --> 00:07:48,561
that's what l've got
in my ear--

182
00:07:48,603 --> 00:07:49,978
l don't make this shit up--

183
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:51,670
is an actual disease.

184
00:07:55,324 --> 00:07:56,534
Go ahead and laugh...

185
00:07:56,572 --> 00:07:58,361
play basketball, have fun.

186
00:07:58,396 --> 00:07:59,324
ln the meantime...

187
00:07:59,356 --> 00:08:02,171
l've got goddamn Quasimodo
going off in my head--

188
00:08:02,205 --> 00:08:03,994
bell tower, you understand me?

189
00:08:04,029 --> 00:08:06,364
l got a bell tower in my head!

190
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:13,139
Hey, you the driver
of this thing?

191
00:08:13,182 --> 00:08:14,164
Yeah.

192
00:08:14,974 --> 00:08:16,534
Pretty easy to drive, is it?

193
00:08:16,575 --> 00:08:18,430
Pretty easy. Uh-huh.

194
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:22,515
Joe?

195
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,574
Oh, my God.

196
00:08:28,607 --> 00:08:30,233
Joe, what are you doing
in a cement truck?

197
00:08:30,271 --> 00:08:31,897
Joe?

198
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,539
Joe, what am l doing?

199
00:09:00,514 --> 00:09:03,035
Why are we
in the concrete thing...

200
00:09:03,074 --> 00:09:04,002
getting shot at?

201
00:09:04,034 --> 00:09:05,376
Just keep your head down!

202
00:09:14,628 --> 00:09:15,577
Joe!

203
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:19,769
Take it down!

204
00:09:25,252 --> 00:09:27,970
Joe. Jesus.
There's, like, a truck!

205
00:09:45,703 --> 00:09:47,711
Joe, Joe!

206
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:55,718
How long you been planning this?

207
00:09:55,752 --> 00:09:57,639
Just sort of came up.

208
00:10:05,193 --> 00:10:06,305
Hang on to something.

209
00:10:19,402 --> 00:10:20,515
Deer!

210
00:10:21,962 --> 00:10:23,107
Plastic.

211
00:10:27,755 --> 00:10:30,211
Don't you think we should be
looking for a road?

212
00:10:45,741 --> 00:10:46,723
Joe.

213
00:10:46,764 --> 00:10:47,942
Stop. Stop, please.

214
00:10:48,428 --> 00:10:49,738
-Ma'am.
-Uh-huh?

215
00:10:49,773 --> 00:10:51,148
We're gonna need
to borrow your car.

216
00:10:51,181 --> 00:10:52,109
-You are?
-Yes.

217
00:10:52,141 --> 00:10:54,181
Would you just unhook
your seat belt, please?

218
00:10:56,846 --> 00:10:58,504
Come on. Here you go.
Very nice.

219
00:10:58,542 --> 00:10:59,556
Thank you.

220
00:11:02,222 --> 00:11:04,044
That's a really lovely dress.

221
00:11:04,654 --> 00:11:05,865
Thank you.

222
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:08,653
-Come on.
-Thank you.

223
00:11:08,686 --> 00:11:09,701
Get in the car.

224
00:11:09,743 --> 00:11:10,823
OK.

225
00:11:11,439 --> 00:11:13,349
-Ma'am.
-Yes?

226
00:11:14,223 --> 00:11:15,151
Don't forget your purse.

227
00:11:15,183 --> 00:11:16,777
Thank you.

228
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:27,563
OK, first things first.

229
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,528
We need, uh--what do we need?

230
00:11:28,561 --> 00:11:29,935
We need clothes.

231
00:11:29,969 --> 00:11:31,495
We're gonna need money.

232
00:11:32,561 --> 00:11:34,023
A place to hide.

233
00:11:34,065 --> 00:11:35,527
We better get
a new car pretty quick.

234
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:37,096
l don't feel good about driving
down Main Street...

235
00:11:37,137 --> 00:11:39,559
wearing clothes that say inmate,
you know what l mean?

236
00:11:40,594 --> 00:11:42,569
Hey, why are we stopping here?

237
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:44,399
This is where they
keep the cash.

238
00:11:49,522 --> 00:11:51,759
Hey! Stupid!

239
00:11:54,067 --> 00:11:55,179
What cash?

240
00:11:57,907 --> 00:11:59,085
Didn't you say something
about needing money?

241
00:11:59,123 --> 00:12:01,163
Well, yeah, but, l mean,
not right now.

242
00:12:01,204 --> 00:12:03,375
Look, Joe, let's just
discuss this for a minute, OK?

243
00:12:03,412 --> 00:12:04,524
l mean, l knowthat money's
on the list...

244
00:12:04,564 --> 00:12:06,353
but it's not at the top
of the list.

245
00:12:07,124 --> 00:12:08,815
-Bingo!
-Bingo what?

246
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:10,227
What do you mean, bingo?

247
00:12:10,996 --> 00:12:13,647
Are you gonna knock over a bank
with a magic marker?

248
00:12:13,685 --> 00:12:15,540
l mean, what are you
gonna do, write on them?

249
00:12:15,573 --> 00:12:16,686
We don't even have a plan.

250
00:12:16,725 --> 00:12:18,154
You have to have
some kind of plan...

251
00:12:18,198 --> 00:12:19,507
to rob a bank.

252
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:20,818
We're wearing matching
denim uniforms...

253
00:12:20,853 --> 00:12:22,097
that say inmate on them.

254
00:12:22,134 --> 00:12:23,541
Unless these people are blind...

255
00:12:23,574 --> 00:12:26,159
l don't think this is
gonna work, you understand?

256
00:12:29,846 --> 00:12:31,090
Don't move.

257
00:12:31,127 --> 00:12:32,207
Take out your gun...

258
00:12:32,247 --> 00:12:34,135
thumb and middle finger
on the butt.

259
00:12:34,167 --> 00:12:35,629
Hand it to me slowly.

260
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:36,784
Here we go.

261
00:12:37,495 --> 00:12:38,575
Ladies and gentlemen,
we'll be out of your way...

262
00:12:38,616 --> 00:12:39,543
in just a second.

263
00:12:39,576 --> 00:12:41,431
No phone calls,
no alarms, please.

264
00:12:41,463 --> 00:12:42,391
Cash drawers open.

265
00:12:42,423 --> 00:12:44,049
Take a bag, fill it with cash.

266
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,255
Cash, please.

267
00:12:46,296 --> 00:12:47,638
Ma'am, is there any other cash
in the back?

268
00:12:47,673 --> 00:12:49,233
-No.
-Don't touch that phone, sir.

269
00:12:49,273 --> 00:12:50,200
-Are you sure?
-l'm positive.

270
00:12:50,233 --> 00:12:51,793
Don't touch that.
Are you telling me the truth?

271
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:52,760
l'm telling you the truth.

272
00:12:52,793 --> 00:12:54,037
You look very honest.

273
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:55,634
Quickly, please. Thank you.

274
00:12:55,673 --> 00:12:58,259
He made no plan
whatsoever for this.

275
00:12:58,297 --> 00:12:59,410
Here we go.
Put that right in there.

276
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:00,377
We'll take that. Thank you.

277
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:01,719
Thank you, thank you.

278
00:13:01,754 --> 00:13:02,801
l'll take that. Here we go.

279
00:13:02,841 --> 00:13:04,151
OK. Thank you very much.

280
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:10,355
Oh, there's just never
enough time when you're working.

281
00:13:10,395 --> 00:13:11,856
Thank you for your cooperation.

282
00:13:11,899 --> 00:13:13,425
No phone calls, no alarms.

283
00:13:13,467 --> 00:13:14,394
Here we go. Come on.

284
00:13:14,427 --> 00:13:15,856
Take that.

285
00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:17,241
Take this.

286
00:13:17,275 --> 00:13:18,323
Sir, in case you need
to highlight anything.

287
00:13:18,363 --> 00:13:20,535
Here we go. Come on.

288
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:25,301
Hey, hey, hey. Stop, stop.

289
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:27,729
Hey, hey. Whoa, ho, ho, ho!

290
00:13:27,772 --> 00:13:28,700
What?

291
00:13:28,732 --> 00:13:29,943
Sir, we need to borrow your car.

292
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,507
Find a bus, asshole.

293
00:13:33,501 --> 00:13:35,323
Hey, come over here. This car.

294
00:13:53,183 --> 00:13:54,263
You got the gun?

295
00:13:56,287 --> 00:13:57,236
No.

296
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,701
Come back here, goddamn it.
Hold it!

297
00:14:03,744 --> 00:14:05,915
Come on. Sit up and act regular.

298
00:14:17,601 --> 00:14:19,128
Hold it right there.

299
00:14:26,754 --> 00:14:27,802
Chest pain...

300
00:14:27,842 --> 00:14:28,987
left arm a little numb...

301
00:14:29,026 --> 00:14:30,783
accelerated heartbeat, spots.

302
00:14:30,818 --> 00:14:33,153
l'm actually seeing spots.

303
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,510
Hang on.

304
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:42,522
l'm feeling nauseous.

305
00:14:50,661 --> 00:14:51,773
Out!

306
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:18,752
Are you all right?

307
00:15:20,103 --> 00:15:22,558
May l please go back to prison?

308
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,061
Not yet.

309
00:16:11,532 --> 00:16:12,961
Oh, shit!

310
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,610
What's your name?

311
00:16:45,647 --> 00:16:46,695
Cheri.

312
00:16:46,736 --> 00:16:48,809
Zip up your pants, Cheri.

313
00:16:52,753 --> 00:16:54,094
You, too.

314
00:16:54,128 --> 00:16:55,470

315
00:16:57,456 --> 00:16:59,278
So where's your mom, Cheri?

316
00:16:59,313 --> 00:17:01,484
My mom doesn't
live here anymore.

317
00:17:02,385 --> 00:17:03,498
And your dad?

318
00:17:03,537 --> 00:17:05,806
Oh, he's fishing
for the weekend.

319
00:17:05,841 --> 00:17:08,045
So your dad left you here
all alone.

320
00:17:08,081 --> 00:17:11,824
Oh, no. He thinks l'm
at a friend's house.

321
00:17:11,857 --> 00:17:13,646
And how about you, Scooter?

322
00:17:13,682 --> 00:17:16,551
Oh, l told my folks
l had a soccer trip.

323
00:17:17,811 --> 00:17:18,891
You lied to your parents?

324
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:21,386
Oh, you're kidding, right?

325
00:17:21,427 --> 00:17:22,856
No, l'm not kidding.

326
00:17:28,372 --> 00:17:29,834

00:17:31,988 --> 00:17:34,738
Hey, you're inmates.

329
00:17:36,532 --> 00:17:38,507
What did you say your name was?

330
00:17:38,548 --> 00:17:39,792
Uh, Phil.

331
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:41,844
You think there's
something funny...

332
00:17:41,876 --> 00:17:43,371
about being an inmate, Phil?

333
00:17:47,797 --> 00:17:49,390
We're bank robbers, OK?

334
00:18:00,087 --> 00:18:01,712
So what's on our mind?

335
00:18:03,446 --> 00:18:05,389
Parizo Del Mar.

336
00:18:05,431 --> 00:18:07,286
Parizo?

337
00:18:08,215 --> 00:18:09,742
Paradise.

338
00:18:09,783 --> 00:18:11,474
My uncle owns this little hotel
on the water...

339
00:18:11,512 --> 00:18:13,781
about 100 miles south
of Acapulco.

340
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,050
That's Mexico.

341
00:18:16,088 --> 00:18:18,641
Right. That's where they keep
Acapulco, Terry.

342
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,819
But l have
sanitation issues, Joe.

343
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:22,770
We'll buy the hotel...

344
00:18:22,808 --> 00:18:25,078
turn it
into a nightclub and resort.

345
00:18:25,113 --> 00:18:26,608
l could wear a tuxedo...

346
00:18:26,649 --> 00:18:28,536
sell margaritas
to the tourists.

347
00:18:29,273 --> 00:18:31,029
We could have some fun.

348
00:18:33,017 --> 00:18:34,032
You'd do that?

349
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:36,144
l mean, you and me?

350
00:18:36,186 --> 00:18:38,041
Yeah.

351
00:18:38,074 --> 00:18:39,121
Partners?

352
00:18:39,163 --> 00:18:40,275
Partners.

353
00:18:42,779 --> 00:18:44,535
Tuxedos and margaritas?

354
00:18:45,531 --> 00:18:47,539
-Good, right?
-Yeah.

355
00:18:47,579 --> 00:18:48,757
l can run the kitchen.

356
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:50,006
You can work the room.

357
00:18:51,292 --> 00:18:52,754
lt's a high-risk business,
but, l mean...

358
00:18:52,796 --> 00:18:53,811
considering the alternatives...

359
00:18:53,852 --> 00:18:56,470
l got to say l think
that sounds really good.

360
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:00,915
l just have one question.
How do we pay for it?

361
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:04,915
Well...

362
00:19:04,957 --> 00:19:06,648
we are bank robbers.

363
00:19:10,109 --> 00:19:11,386
So where is it?

364
00:19:11,421 --> 00:19:14,204
Below my belt
and above my knees.

365
00:19:14,238 --> 00:19:15,831
You know what l mean.

366
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:17,757
You are gonna get us killed.

367
00:19:19,102 --> 00:19:21,044
Maybe l'll save the day...

368
00:19:21,086 --> 00:19:23,258
and we'll both be rich
and famous and on TV.

369
00:19:23,294 --> 00:19:25,018
l think there's a way
to do it right.

370
00:19:25,054 --> 00:19:26,364
l'm sure of it.

371
00:19:26,399 --> 00:19:28,788
So, where is it?

372
00:19:28,831 --> 00:19:31,679
ln Daddy's closet,
behind the golf clubs.

373
00:19:34,944 --> 00:19:36,089
All right. l'm going.

374
00:19:37,536 --> 00:19:40,285
What's the biggest problem
every time you rob a bank?

375
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,247
Getting caught?

376
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,360
Exactly.

377
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,310
There's guards to shoot at you.

378
00:19:44,353 --> 00:19:45,630
There's tellers to hit alarms.

379
00:19:45,665 --> 00:19:47,127
There's customers to get
in the way, right?

380
00:19:47,169 --> 00:19:48,118
Right.

381
00:19:48,897 --> 00:19:50,720
You need to control
the environment--

382
00:19:50,753 --> 00:19:53,143
no guards, no tellers,
no customers.

383
00:19:53,634 --> 00:19:54,681
Yeah, but if you
work at night...

384
00:19:54,721 --> 00:19:56,631
you still got to deal
with the alarms.

385
00:19:56,674 --> 00:19:58,562
But we don't work at night.

386
00:20:00,194 --> 00:20:01,983
When do you do it?
Holidays?

387
00:20:02,018 --> 00:20:03,066
No.

388
00:20:06,146 --> 00:20:08,318
We do it
with the bank manager...

389
00:20:08,355 --> 00:20:10,941
in the morning,
with the bank manager's keys...

390
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:13,118
and the bank manager's
vault codes...

391
00:20:13,923 --> 00:20:15,996
because we kidnap him
the night before.

392
00:20:18,148 --> 00:20:19,326
l mean, think about it.

393
00:20:19,364 --> 00:20:21,187
We pick a town.
We pick a bank.

394
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,781
We find out who's in charge.

395
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:23,681
We pay him a little visit.

396
00:20:23,717 --> 00:20:25,888
We spend the night with him,
like we are here.

397
00:20:25,925 --> 00:20:27,616
The next morning,
we all go to work together...

398
00:20:27,653 --> 00:20:29,409
before anybody else gets there.

399
00:20:32,358 --> 00:20:33,667
And we take the money and run.

400
00:20:35,909 --> 00:20:38,757
Tuxedos and margaritas, Joe,
just like you said.

401
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,212
Life will be like
one big sunset.

402
00:21:09,417 --> 00:21:10,759
Want to see something neat?

403
00:21:12,873 --> 00:21:14,215
Aim the shotgun at me.

404
00:21:14,985 --> 00:21:15,913
What?

405
00:21:15,946 --> 00:21:17,091
Aim it at me.

406
00:21:24,522 --> 00:21:25,450
Freeze?

407
00:21:25,482 --> 00:21:27,621
Pretty good.

408
00:21:27,658 --> 00:21:29,797
But first you got to pump
a shell into the chamber...

409
00:21:29,835 --> 00:21:30,915
like this.

410
00:21:37,515 --> 00:21:38,464
Neat.

411
00:21:39,404 --> 00:21:41,739
The conversation is over,
all right?

412
00:21:41,772 --> 00:21:42,787
Well, l feel good
in this collar--

413
00:21:42,828 --> 00:21:44,389
l've always liked this
kind of collar--

414
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:46,567
but you boned me
on the pants, Joe.

415
00:21:47,308 --> 00:21:49,675
lt's really not fair.
lt's a low blow.

416
00:21:49,709 --> 00:21:51,597
l picked those pants out for me.
l laid them out.

417
00:21:51,629 --> 00:21:52,611
l specifically chose those.

418
00:21:52,653 --> 00:21:55,523
Well, well,
look at you gentlemen.

419
00:21:55,565 --> 00:21:57,060
Are the clothes all right?

420
00:21:58,414 --> 00:22:00,236
Aren't we looking
a bit spiffy in plaid?

421
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:01,480
Oh, he likes plaid.

422
00:22:02,862 --> 00:22:03,790
Two sugars, right?

423
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:04,750
Thank you very much.

424
00:22:04,783 --> 00:22:06,124
Cheri, we're gonna
have to borrow Phil's car.

425
00:22:07,182 --> 00:22:08,906
That's OK.
He doesn't mind.

426
00:22:08,942 --> 00:22:10,153
The hell l don't.

427
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:11,751
That's a newtransmission.

428
00:22:14,415 --> 00:22:15,692
So where are we headed?

429
00:22:15,727 --> 00:22:17,037
Rufus.

430
00:22:17,071 --> 00:22:18,118
Where's Rufus?

431
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,404
lt's up the road
a little ways.

432
00:22:19,439 --> 00:22:20,901
What's at Rufus?

433
00:22:22,671 --> 00:22:23,948
Pollard...

434
00:22:24,432 --> 00:22:26,604
Harvey Pollard.

435
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,982
What?

436
00:22:28,017 --> 00:22:29,675
Oh, you feel the need to shoot?

437
00:22:31,985 --> 00:22:33,708
Well, go ahead and shoot, then.

438
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:44,108
What, you feel
the need to shoot?

439
00:22:45,746 --> 00:22:47,405
Well, go ahead and shoot, then.

440
00:22:51,474 --> 00:22:52,903
Oh, to hell with it.

441
00:22:54,739 --> 00:22:55,667
Feel the need--

442
00:22:55,699 --> 00:22:56,648
Draw!

443
00:23:11,317 --> 00:23:12,299
Dog!

444
00:23:13,333 --> 00:23:14,281
Joe!

445
00:23:16,629 --> 00:23:17,578
Joe?

446
00:23:20,245 --> 00:23:21,391
Joe.

447
00:23:23,413 --> 00:23:24,875
What's up? l thought
you were still in--

448
00:23:24,918 --> 00:23:27,285
No, got out early.

449
00:23:28,598 --> 00:23:29,526
Terry...

450
00:23:29,559 --> 00:23:31,533
say hello to my cousin
Harvey Pollard.

451
00:23:31,575 --> 00:23:32,502
Glad to know you.

452
00:23:32,535 --> 00:23:35,285
Any friend of Joe's, man...
Was it Harry?

453
00:23:36,663 --> 00:23:37,611
Terry.

454
00:23:37,656 --> 00:23:39,314
Those are wicked pants.

455
00:23:41,655 --> 00:23:43,695
So, what are you doing?
Working?

456
00:23:43,736 --> 00:23:47,314
Special effects--
well, stunt work, primarily.

457
00:23:47,352 --> 00:23:50,801
Mostly training right now.
Damn squibs won't fire.

458
00:23:51,512 --> 00:23:53,716
We're looking for somebody
who can handle a car.

459
00:23:53,753 --> 00:23:55,095
l can do that. Why?

460
00:23:55,673 --> 00:23:56,917
Banks.

461
00:24:00,186 --> 00:24:01,168
You're fooling with me.

462
00:24:03,418 --> 00:24:05,939
Well, hell, Joe, l'm just
the man you're looking for.

463
00:24:05,978 --> 00:24:07,222
You want a beer?

464
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:09,014
Yeah, l'll take a beer.

465
00:24:15,739 --> 00:24:16,949
Timer malfunction.

466
00:24:17,435 --> 00:24:18,383
Draw!

467
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:21,910
l'm gonna get a beer.

468
00:24:25,596 --> 00:24:26,545
He's honest...

469
00:24:27,548 --> 00:24:29,370
and he falls real good.

470
00:24:33,949 --> 00:24:36,251
Me, l'm gonna make a name
for myself in fire.

471
00:24:37,533 --> 00:24:40,316
l've been practicing with gels--
you know, mostly on my hands...

472
00:24:40,349 --> 00:24:42,488
but l need a suit.

473
00:24:42,526 --> 00:24:43,835
Harvey, speaking of the job--

474
00:24:43,869 --> 00:24:45,975
You ever wonder why a man
would set himself on fire...

475
00:24:46,014 --> 00:24:48,567
and jump off the top
of a twelve-story building?

476
00:24:48,606 --> 00:24:49,947
Gosh, no, l didn't, Harv.

477
00:24:49,982 --> 00:24:52,884
Women love a man
who loves danger.

478
00:24:56,319 --> 00:24:58,042
You guys were talking about
before--about the frontman.

479
00:24:58,079 --> 00:24:59,061
You kept mentioning this guy.

480
00:24:59,103 --> 00:25:00,598
Will you explain to the people
at home--and to me--

481
00:25:00,639 --> 00:25:03,159
what exactly the frontman does
and who he is?

482
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,956
Well, Darren...

483
00:25:05,952 --> 00:25:08,188
the frontman handles pretty much
everything else...

484
00:25:08,224 --> 00:25:09,304
except robbing the bank.

485
00:25:09,344 --> 00:25:11,002
He rents the rooms.

486
00:25:11,041 --> 00:25:14,074
He gets the supplies, the food
that, you know, we would eat.

487
00:25:14,113 --> 00:25:17,462
He drives the getaway car.

488
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:21,816
Joe and l maintain
what you call a low profile.

489
00:25:21,857 --> 00:25:22,784
Right.

490
00:25:22,817 --> 00:25:24,377
lf the frontman
is never seen in a bank...

491
00:25:24,418 --> 00:25:26,360
we're never seen out of one.

492
00:25:26,402 --> 00:25:28,955
l plotted all the banks
that we would rob...

493
00:25:28,994 --> 00:25:31,198
from Oregon to California.

494
00:25:31,234 --> 00:25:34,104
Our first bank on the list
was the Oregon City Bank.

495
00:25:34,146 --> 00:25:35,455
So the schedules
and the routines...

496
00:25:35,491 --> 00:25:37,695
and the bank guards,
the tellers, everything--

497
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:38,713
we got it all down...

498
00:25:38,755 --> 00:25:41,057
but mostly we watched
our first hostage...

499
00:25:41,091 --> 00:25:42,914
Darill Miller,
the bank president...

500
00:25:42,947 --> 00:25:43,962
who didn't know it yet...

501
00:25:44,003 --> 00:25:45,051
but he was about
to spend the night...

502
00:25:45,092 --> 00:25:46,881
with the Sleepover Bandits.

503
00:25:46,916 --> 00:25:48,345
That sounded good, right?

504
00:25:48,387 --> 00:25:49,315
Yeah, it's pretty--

505
00:25:49,348 --> 00:25:50,395
''Didn't know it yet, but he was
about to spend the night...

506
00:25:50,436 --> 00:25:52,192
''with the Sleepover Bandits.''

507
00:25:52,228 --> 00:25:53,406
lt's very newsworthy.

508
00:25:54,468 --> 00:25:56,443
Look. lt's his job, all right?

509
00:25:56,484 --> 00:25:58,078
l asked him to get me
a good mustache...

510
00:25:58,117 --> 00:25:59,044
and he gives me something
that looks like...

511
00:25:59,077 --> 00:26:00,506
it come out of
a Cracker Jack box.

512
00:26:00,549 --> 00:26:01,924
This is not about the mustache.

513
00:26:01,957 --> 00:26:03,135
We're going to work.

514
00:26:03,173 --> 00:26:04,384
He got you a nice wig.

515
00:26:04,421 --> 00:26:05,916
Look at you.
You look great.

516
00:26:05,958 --> 00:26:07,900
Have you noticed the burns?
They're kind of flapping.

517
00:26:11,334 --> 00:26:12,795
Hon, can you get the door?

518
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:18,619
Everybody, dinner
in a half-hour!

519
00:26:25,639 --> 00:26:26,588
Howdy.

520
00:26:27,399 --> 00:26:29,188
We're here to rob
your goddamn bank.

521
00:26:29,223 --> 00:26:30,303
Now just get in there.

522
00:26:39,176 --> 00:26:40,933
lt's OK, Mommy.

523
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:54,985
The important thing here--

524
00:27:01,035 --> 00:27:02,890
The important thing
to remember--

525
00:27:03,755 --> 00:27:04,683
The important thing...

526
00:27:04,715 --> 00:27:07,530
is that we spend
a quiet night together...

527
00:27:07,564 --> 00:27:08,808
and then tomorrow morning,
bright and early...

528
00:27:08,843 --> 00:27:11,331
we all go down to the bank
together and--

529
00:27:11,372 --> 00:27:12,932
it's really a reasonable
proposition...

530
00:27:12,972 --> 00:27:14,860
if you think about it.

531
00:27:15,341 --> 00:27:16,289
Sure.

532
00:27:17,292 --> 00:27:18,699
Whatever you say.

533
00:27:18,733 --> 00:27:19,878
That's the spirit.

534
00:27:21,453 --> 00:27:23,177
Stop playing
with your food, Erika.

535
00:27:23,213 --> 00:27:25,734
But it's too long.

536
00:27:26,541 --> 00:27:27,752
Here.

537
00:27:27,789 --> 00:27:29,928
Next time l want you to try
to wrap it around your fork...

538
00:27:29,965 --> 00:27:31,111
just like Daddy does.

539
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:33,956
Cut mine, Mom.

540
00:27:33,998 --> 00:27:34,925
Just a second, hon.

541
00:27:34,958 --> 00:27:36,681
The sauce is too red.

542
00:27:36,719 --> 00:27:37,667
lt's not too red.

543
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:40,329
Yes, it is.
The sauce is too red.

544
00:27:48,463 --> 00:27:49,543
You know, actually,
Mrs. Miller...

545
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:51,177
this sauce is quite terrific.

546
00:27:51,216 --> 00:27:52,842
-lt's delicious.
-lsn't it?

547
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,025
l hate it.

548
00:27:54,672 --> 00:27:55,620
Thank you.

549
00:27:57,841 --> 00:27:59,117
What time's the vault set for?

550
00:28:00,176 --> 00:28:01,104
7:30.

551
00:28:01,136 --> 00:28:02,085
Tomato lemon?

552
00:28:04,529 --> 00:28:06,318
Lemon zest, oregano,
a little cream--

553
00:28:06,353 --> 00:28:07,531
see, l cook a little.

554
00:28:08,017 --> 00:28:08,966
Keys?

555
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:10,470
Two.

556
00:28:10,514 --> 00:28:11,975
l have one.

557
00:28:12,018 --> 00:28:15,280
The operations officer
has the other one.

558
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:17,897
There's something in here
l can't identify, though.

559
00:28:17,938 --> 00:28:18,887
ls it basil?

560
00:28:21,939 --> 00:28:23,216
Rosemary?
No, don't tell me.

561
00:28:24,371 --> 00:28:25,997
lt's not that big of a deal.

562
00:28:26,675 --> 00:28:28,050
lt's saffron.

563
00:28:31,476 --> 00:28:33,385
Yes, it's saffron.

564
00:28:33,427 --> 00:28:35,370
Bingo. l knew it.

565
00:28:36,148 --> 00:28:37,708
You know, sometimes l put
a little sugar in mine.

566
00:28:37,748 --> 00:28:39,177
lt cuts the acidity.

567
00:28:39,221 --> 00:28:40,879
Sugar.

568
00:28:40,916 --> 00:28:42,062
Thank you. l'll...

569
00:28:42,101 --> 00:28:43,727
try to remember that.

570
00:28:43,765 --> 00:28:45,009
Little tricks, you know.

571
00:28:45,044 --> 00:28:47,019
Want to see something
cool that l can do?

572
00:28:47,509 --> 00:28:48,687
Sure.

573
00:28:54,486 --> 00:28:55,414
Monica.

574
00:28:55,446 --> 00:28:56,374
What?

575
00:28:56,406 --> 00:28:59,440
We've got guests...sort of.

576
00:29:07,063 --> 00:29:10,195
You really think you're gonna
fool anybody in that getup?

577
00:29:10,231 --> 00:29:12,304
l mean, you look like
Neil Young from that--

578
00:29:12,343 --> 00:29:13,271
what was that album?

579
00:29:13,303 --> 00:29:16,500
''After the Horses'' or...

580
00:29:16,536 --> 00:29:18,903
lt was ''After the Gold Rush,''
and that's not the one.

581
00:29:18,936 --> 00:29:19,864
lt's the one
where he's leaning...

582
00:29:19,897 --> 00:29:21,391
against a tree in the snow
or whatever.

583
00:29:21,432 --> 00:29:23,342
That's what l was
actually going for.

584
00:29:23,385 --> 00:29:25,295
Getting out of the bank
is almost as important...

585
00:29:25,337 --> 00:29:26,613
as getting into it.

586
00:29:26,649 --> 00:29:29,944
The hostages were kept under
the strictest possible guard...

587
00:29:29,977 --> 00:29:33,174
to prevent escape
or alarm of any type, you see?

588
00:29:33,721 --> 00:29:37,334
See, we had to bring
their kids along...

589
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:38,897
the Miller children.

590
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:40,857
Butane?

591
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:42,963
Copy. This is Butane.

592
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:45,713
You're all clear and ready
to rock and roll.

593
00:29:45,755 --> 00:29:48,984
Please turn your music down.
l can't hear a word you said.

594
00:29:49,019 --> 00:29:51,408
You're ready to rock and roll!

595
00:29:51,451 --> 00:29:52,379
Thank you.

596
00:29:52,411 --> 00:29:54,583
OK, girls.
You just stay right here.

597
00:29:55,868 --> 00:29:57,810
Everybody should be here
in ten minutes.

598
00:29:58,588 --> 00:29:59,995
What's the all clear?

599
00:30:00,029 --> 00:30:01,305
What's that?

600
00:30:06,589 --> 00:30:09,404
Washington...on the inside.

601
00:30:09,437 --> 00:30:10,484
What?

602
00:30:10,525 --> 00:30:12,020
George Washington.

603
00:30:12,765 --> 00:30:15,220
When it's all clear,
he's facing in.

604
00:30:17,213 --> 00:30:18,588
Make it all clear, Darill.

605
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,964
Cool.

606
00:30:51,137 --> 00:30:52,217
Three more.

607
00:30:54,786 --> 00:30:55,713
Good morning.

608
00:30:55,746 --> 00:30:56,607
Good morning, Darill.

609
00:30:56,641 --> 00:30:57,590
Good morning.

610
00:30:58,882 --> 00:31:00,224
Good morning, ladies.

611
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:03,581
ls this a joke?

612
00:31:04,066 --> 00:31:04,994
No, ma'am.

613
00:31:05,026 --> 00:31:06,368
This is a bank robbery.

614
00:31:07,138 --> 00:31:08,066
Hurry it up.

615
00:31:08,098 --> 00:31:09,178
lt's not a parade. Come on.

616
00:31:09,219 --> 00:31:10,626
All righty, then.

617
00:31:10,659 --> 00:31:11,903
Just have a seat
with everybody else.

618
00:31:11,939 --> 00:31:13,183
lt's not gonna take long.

619
00:31:13,219 --> 00:31:14,147
Monica?

620
00:31:14,179 --> 00:31:15,107
l have to go to the bathroom.

621
00:31:15,139 --> 00:31:17,343
No more juice boxes, Cloe, OK?

622
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:19,998
lf it weren't for the fact
that the kids had bladders...

623
00:31:20,036 --> 00:31:21,443
the size of hummingbirds...

624
00:31:21,476 --> 00:31:22,938
it would have been done...

625
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:25,184
Well, they drank a lot of juice.

626
00:31:25,221 --> 00:31:26,715
One of these days,
you're gonna get caught.

627
00:31:26,756 --> 00:31:27,836
lt's a very dangerous job.

628
00:31:27,877 --> 00:31:30,692
Aren't you ever
scared and afraid?

629
00:31:31,397 --> 00:31:32,826
When you know danger
the way we do--

630
00:31:32,869 --> 00:31:35,619
l know it like an animal,
like a wild animal.

631
00:31:35,653 --> 00:31:37,988
You know what they
call me in jail?

632
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:38,949
No, l don't.

633
00:31:38,981 --> 00:31:40,159
The panther.

634
00:31:40,198 --> 00:31:41,180
Ladies and gentlemen...

635
00:31:41,222 --> 00:31:42,466
thank you very much
for your cooperation.

636
00:31:42,502 --> 00:31:43,451
Please make no
attempt to escape...

637
00:31:43,494 --> 00:31:45,382
because we will be monitoring
the police scanners...

638
00:31:45,414 --> 00:31:46,462
and we'll kill you if you do.

639
00:31:46,502 --> 00:31:48,510
When you're
a well-oiled machine...

640
00:31:48,551 --> 00:31:50,242
you exude danger.

641
00:31:50,279 --> 00:31:51,207
Sure.

642
00:31:51,239 --> 00:31:52,548
People fear you.

643
00:31:53,607 --> 00:31:55,266
They fear your presence.

644
00:31:55,303 --> 00:31:57,278
The gun, really, is secondary.

645
00:31:58,312 --> 00:31:59,260
Thank you.

646
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:34,214
Now listen.
We go our separate ways.

647
00:32:34,251 --> 00:32:35,625
Two weeks from today, we meet--

648
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:36,587
-Klamath Falls.
-Klamath Falls, right.

649
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:38,049
You take this map.
lt's on there.

650
00:32:38,091 --> 00:32:39,106
l want to go with Joe.

651
00:32:39,148 --> 00:32:40,228
You can't do that.

652
00:32:40,267 --> 00:32:41,642
You can't.
They're looking for two men...

653
00:32:41,676 --> 00:32:42,658
and that's why
we're splitting up...

654
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:44,391
and going solo as planned.

655
00:32:44,428 --> 00:32:46,217
What am l supposed
to do for two weeks?

656
00:32:46,252 --> 00:32:47,594
You stay out of trouble.
Try that.

657
00:32:47,629 --> 00:32:48,970
What about the minivan?

658
00:32:49,005 --> 00:32:49,987
You leave it here.

659
00:32:50,028 --> 00:32:52,134
l like the minivan.
lt's roomy.

660
00:32:52,173 --> 00:32:55,435
l appreciate that,
but as it's a stolen minivan...

661
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:57,412
it's probably better
that you leave it here.

662
00:32:57,453 --> 00:32:58,380
Let's go. We got to go.
Come on.

663
00:32:58,413 --> 00:32:59,341
Well, what about my money?

664
00:32:59,373 --> 00:33:00,388
There's yours right there.

665
00:33:00,429 --> 00:33:01,924
We split it three ways,
nothing fancy.

666
00:33:01,966 --> 00:33:04,454
l'm gonna buy me a fire suit,
first thing.

667
00:33:04,494 --> 00:33:06,218
l bet l can mail-order
one out of L.A.

668
00:33:06,254 --> 00:33:07,531
Way to go.
Good job, man.

669
00:33:07,566 --> 00:33:08,494
You, too, buddy.
We did it.

670
00:33:08,526 --> 00:33:10,665
Be careful.
Stay out of trouble.

671
00:33:10,702 --> 00:33:12,677
What are you gonna buy
with your shares?

672
00:33:12,719 --> 00:33:14,148
Paradise.

673
00:33:14,191 --> 00:33:15,653
Two weeks.
Klamath Falls.

674
00:33:15,695 --> 00:33:16,643
Be careful!

675
00:33:21,168 --> 00:33:23,437
Joe Blake and Terry Collins...

676
00:33:23,471 --> 00:33:24,813
this is Lieutenant McCormick...

677
00:33:24,848 --> 00:33:27,215
of the Los Angeles
Police Department.

678
00:33:27,248 --> 00:33:29,900
Put down your weapons
and come out of the bank...

679
00:33:29,936 --> 00:33:31,846
with your hands in the air.

680
00:33:36,945 --> 00:33:38,156
This could be a bad time...

681
00:33:38,193 --> 00:33:40,365
but l just want to point out
that l did warn you that...

682
00:33:40,401 --> 00:33:42,059
that woman was gonna be
the ruin of us.

683
00:33:42,098 --> 00:33:44,334
Right. Understood.

684
00:33:45,682 --> 00:33:48,911
But as our future looks
rather bleak and miserable...

685
00:33:49,683 --> 00:33:50,927
l suggest we figure out
what got us here...

686
00:33:50,962 --> 00:33:52,206
in the first place...

687
00:33:54,387 --> 00:33:56,656
which brings us
back to that woman.

688
00:34:25,173 --> 00:34:27,378
The most common symptom
of vaginitis...

689
00:34:27,414 --> 00:34:30,643
is an abnormal
vaginal discharge, often...

690
00:34:32,662 --> 00:34:35,216
...probably from an allergic
reaction to mites.

691
00:35:30,812 --> 00:35:31,990
Out of gas.

692
00:35:32,028 --> 00:35:33,305
Shit.

693
00:36:02,303 --> 00:36:03,896
What is that smell?

694
00:36:05,439 --> 00:36:07,349
lt's a gratin
with Florence fennel...

695
00:36:07,391 --> 00:36:08,635
new potatoes...

696
00:36:09,472 --> 00:36:12,287
clam and sorrel soup
with cream and mirepoix...

697
00:36:13,697 --> 00:36:15,322
and stuffed quail.

698
00:36:16,096 --> 00:36:17,591
Kate, l have a dinner tonight--

699
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:18,615
clients.

700
00:36:19,617 --> 00:36:20,795
Tonight?

701
00:36:24,705 --> 00:36:26,232
Oh, well, it's just for fun.

702
00:36:29,634 --> 00:36:31,608
l'm going to the gym.
See you.

703
00:36:42,915 --> 00:36:44,027
Sweetheart?

704
00:36:44,068 --> 00:36:45,442
Yeah?

705
00:36:45,476 --> 00:36:47,069
Why don't you go see a movie?

706
00:37:22,631 --> 00:37:26,461
We're living in a powder keg
and giving off sparks

707
00:37:26,503 --> 00:37:28,708
l really need you tonight

708
00:37:35,144 --> 00:37:38,014
Once upon a time,
l was falling in love

709
00:37:56,106 --> 00:37:57,055
Stop!

710
00:38:02,987 --> 00:38:04,842
Oh, my God!

711
00:38:04,875 --> 00:38:07,396
Are you all right?
Are you OK?

712
00:38:10,664 --> 00:38:12,519
Come on.
l'm so sorry.

713
00:38:12,552 --> 00:38:14,625
Come on.
Hospital, hospital.

714
00:38:14,664 --> 00:38:17,414
Cascade Memorial Hospital
is located at...

715
00:38:17,449 --> 00:38:19,554
Can you wiggle your toes?

716
00:38:19,593 --> 00:38:20,673
Voices.

717
00:38:20,714 --> 00:38:22,502
22nd Avenue...

718
00:38:22,538 --> 00:38:24,294
Hearing voices.

719
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:25,671
Where are the voices?
Are they--

720
00:38:25,706 --> 00:38:27,430
Are those in my--

721
00:38:27,466 --> 00:38:29,255
Hey, wait.

722
00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:32,105
Uh, hey. You pull--
You pull--

723
00:38:32,139 --> 00:38:33,349
You pull over and--

724
00:38:33,387 --> 00:38:35,143
You pull over
and get out of the car.

725
00:38:35,178 --> 00:38:36,520
You don't have to get
all huffy about it.

726
00:38:36,555 --> 00:38:39,173
You need to pull the car over.

727
00:38:39,212 --> 00:38:41,219
lt was an accident.

728
00:38:41,259 --> 00:38:43,594
Listen.
l'll shoot you with this thing.

729
00:38:43,627 --> 00:38:44,740
Oh, go ahead.

730
00:38:44,779 --> 00:38:46,787
lt'll be an improvement,
believe me.

731
00:38:47,564 --> 00:38:49,320
Will you listen to me, miss?

732
00:38:49,356 --> 00:38:50,534
-Kate.
-Kate.

733
00:38:50,572 --> 00:38:51,652
l'm a desperate man.

734
00:38:51,693 --> 00:38:52,937
-Desperate?
-Yes.

735
00:38:52,972 --> 00:38:54,467
You don't know
the meaning of the word.

736
00:38:54,509 --> 00:38:55,938
Desperate is when
you wake up in the morning...

737
00:38:55,981 --> 00:38:57,094
and you wish you hadn't.

738
00:38:57,133 --> 00:39:00,711
lt's knowing that every time you
get behind the wheel of a car...

739
00:39:00,749 --> 00:39:02,636
you're only a tree away
from ending the empty charade...

740
00:39:02,669 --> 00:39:04,677
that your life has become.

741
00:39:04,718 --> 00:39:06,660
So don't talk to me
about desperate.

742
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:10,819
Listen. On second thought,
why don't you just pull over...

743
00:39:10,862 --> 00:39:11,942
and let me out right here?

744
00:39:11,982 --> 00:39:13,062
Thank you for the lift,
but l'll be fine.

745
00:39:13,102 --> 00:39:14,532
-No. No!
-l'll walk from here. Why?

746
00:39:14,575 --> 00:39:15,819
l'm feeling very fragile
at the moment.

747
00:39:15,854 --> 00:39:17,098
l don't think l should be alone.

748
00:39:17,135 --> 00:39:18,345
You're insane!

749
00:39:21,295 --> 00:39:22,670
l'm unhappy.

750
00:39:22,703 --> 00:39:24,297
lt's not the same thing.

751
00:39:24,976 --> 00:39:27,627
Hey. l'm a fugitive
from justice.

752
00:39:27,664 --> 00:39:28,908
l'm a dangerous criminal.

753
00:39:28,944 --> 00:39:30,918
Oh, well,
that explains the hijacking.

754
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,040
You hit me.

755
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,902
You can't expect to step in
front of a moving automobile...

756
00:39:33,937 --> 00:39:35,017
and make it stop.

757
00:39:35,056 --> 00:39:36,998
Yes, you can.
l've seen it done.

758
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:38,218
Would you not yell at me?

759
00:39:38,257 --> 00:39:40,079
Well, can you slow down
or something?

760
00:39:40,113 --> 00:39:41,258
l want to get out of here.

761
00:39:41,297 --> 00:39:43,436
l'll jump.
That's what l'm gonna do.

762
00:39:43,473 --> 00:39:45,067
How do you unlock this door?

763
00:39:45,106 --> 00:39:46,448
Push a button.
Let--Let--

764
00:39:46,481 --> 00:39:47,791
Unlock this door.

765
00:39:47,826 --> 00:39:50,347
So where you headed?
l'll drop you.

766
00:39:50,386 --> 00:39:51,815
l mean, you're
in no shape to drive.

767
00:39:51,858 --> 00:39:52,840
So you're a fugitive, huh?

768
00:39:52,883 --> 00:39:54,508
What did you do wrong?

769
00:39:54,547 --> 00:39:56,074
Everything.

770
00:39:56,594 --> 00:39:59,890
Alert. Your global positioning
system is rerouting.

771
00:39:59,923 --> 00:40:02,606
Where is that coming from?
What is that?

772
00:40:07,443 --> 00:40:09,266
Between the second set of trees.

773
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:11,439
The second set of trees,
right here.

774
00:40:11,476 --> 00:40:14,924
Look at me! l'm on fire!

775
00:40:15,956 --> 00:40:17,200
Just don't ask.

776
00:40:17,237 --> 00:40:20,499
Lookee! Yeah!

777
00:40:26,838 --> 00:40:28,780
What the hell is this?

778
00:40:28,821 --> 00:40:30,764
Kate, Paul Bunyan. Paul, Kate.

779
00:40:30,806 --> 00:40:31,886
Kate?

780
00:40:31,926 --> 00:40:33,519
l ran out of gas.

781
00:40:33,558 --> 00:40:34,638
And?

782
00:40:34,678 --> 00:40:37,493
And she hit me with her car.

783
00:40:37,526 --> 00:40:39,566
OK. She hit you with her car.

784
00:40:39,607 --> 00:40:41,265
What the hell did you bring her
out here for?

785
00:40:41,303 --> 00:40:42,797
Well, one, l had no choice.

786
00:40:42,839 --> 00:40:44,749
Two, l may have suffered
a slight concussion.

787
00:40:44,791 --> 00:40:46,285
And three,
she's mentally unbalanced...

788
00:40:46,327 --> 00:40:47,637
to a spectacular degree.

789
00:40:47,671 --> 00:40:49,046
l can hear you.

790
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:50,934
l tried to escape.

791
00:40:50,968 --> 00:40:52,048
She wouldn't stop.

792
00:40:52,088 --> 00:40:54,325
l almost jumped
from a speeding car, Joe.

793
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,440
Do you hear me?

794
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,822
l had double vision.

795
00:40:56,857 --> 00:40:58,166
What was l gonna do?

796
00:41:12,986 --> 00:41:16,019
Your left eye's a fraction
darker than your right one.

797
00:41:16,954 --> 00:41:18,548
Nobody ever noticed.

798
00:41:19,514 --> 00:41:20,758
l'm Joe.

799
00:41:20,795 --> 00:41:22,322
l'm Kate.

800
00:41:25,115 --> 00:41:26,489
Oh, what happened to your tooth?

801
00:41:26,523 --> 00:41:27,603
All right. OK.

802
00:41:27,643 --> 00:41:29,137
Why don't you just
get on your way, OK?

803
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:30,609
Act like you never met us.

804
00:41:30,652 --> 00:41:32,278
Send us a postcard
from Crazy Town.

805
00:41:32,316 --> 00:41:33,396
Can l stay here?

806
00:41:33,436 --> 00:41:35,542
Just that l don't know
where else to go.

807
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:37,907
lt'll only be one night.

808
00:41:37,948 --> 00:41:39,028
Please?

809
00:41:39,068 --> 00:41:40,410
l'm not sure we can do that.

810
00:41:40,445 --> 00:41:42,201
Absolutely no way. There's--

811
00:41:42,237 --> 00:41:43,317
That's not possible.

812
00:41:43,357 --> 00:41:45,047
l can't go home.

813
00:41:45,085 --> 00:41:46,776
l can't.

814
00:41:46,813 --> 00:41:48,756
l could go to the police.

815
00:41:48,798 --> 00:41:50,423
l mean, what's to stop me
leading them...

816
00:41:50,462 --> 00:41:51,924
straight to your hideout?

817
00:41:53,309 --> 00:41:55,066
What are you
hiding from, anyway?

818
00:41:55,102 --> 00:41:56,182
l mean, he wouldn't tell me.

819
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:57,717
He's very, very discreet.

820
00:41:57,758 --> 00:41:59,165
Come here, Joe. Come here.

821
00:41:59,199 --> 00:42:00,660
What are you--
What's with the pulling?

822
00:42:00,702 --> 00:42:02,939
-l want to talk with you.
-What's that?

823
00:42:02,975 --> 00:42:05,692
Jeez, this is
a very, very bad idea.

824
00:42:05,727 --> 00:42:07,767
ln the history of bad ideas,
this is a humdinger, OK?

825
00:42:07,807 --> 00:42:09,498
No. She's right
about the police.

826
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:10,615
Shoot her.

827
00:42:10,655 --> 00:42:11,997
Bury her body in the woods.

828
00:42:12,032 --> 00:42:13,821
What am l, invisible?

829
00:42:13,856 --> 00:42:15,514
She said she doesn't have
anyplace to stay.

830
00:42:15,552 --> 00:42:16,697
lt's none of our business.

831
00:42:16,736 --> 00:42:17,882
lt is nowthat you
brought her here, isn't it?

832
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,895
Well, l needed a ride, OK?

833
00:42:19,936 --> 00:42:23,133
l mean, there l was,
sprawled out on the asphalt, OK?

834
00:42:24,065 --> 00:42:26,007
You knowthe hardest thing
about being smart?

835
00:42:26,753 --> 00:42:27,833
No.

836
00:42:27,873 --> 00:42:29,695
l always pretty much know
what's gonna happen next.

837
00:42:29,730 --> 00:42:31,388
There's no suspense.

838
00:42:31,425 --> 00:42:32,505
And don't think l didn't see...

839
00:42:32,546 --> 00:42:33,626
the look in your eye
over there...

840
00:42:33,666 --> 00:42:35,771
and feeling her little hair
and all that kind of stuff.

841
00:42:35,810 --> 00:42:38,974
l'm implementing a 24-hour rule
from now on, OK?

842
00:42:39,010 --> 00:42:40,319
lt's in effect.

843
00:42:40,866 --> 00:42:41,946
Twenty-four hours.

844
00:42:41,986 --> 00:42:43,896
Twenty-four hours and not
a minute longer, missy.

845
00:42:43,938 --> 00:42:44,866
Thank you.

846
00:42:44,898 --> 00:42:46,142
''Missy.''

847
00:42:46,659 --> 00:42:48,285
Hey. l'll cook dinner.

848
00:42:48,323 --> 00:42:50,047
l cook the dinners around here.

849
00:42:50,083 --> 00:42:52,604
Sorry. Not familiar
with the outlaw code.

850
00:42:53,443 --> 00:42:55,549
Does that mean l'm a hostage?

851
00:42:56,612 --> 00:42:57,856
Well, l was in Las Vegas.

852
00:42:57,892 --> 00:42:58,972
Don't get excited.

853
00:42:59,012 --> 00:43:00,321
l'm not talking to you.

854
00:43:00,357 --> 00:43:02,397
Well, Joe, you knowthe costs.

855
00:43:02,436 --> 00:43:04,608
Hotel remodeling, real estate.

856
00:43:04,645 --> 00:43:07,231
l've estimated $20,000
for the kitchen alone.

857
00:43:07,269 --> 00:43:09,790
l mean, we're talking
about restaurant quality here...

858
00:43:09,829 --> 00:43:11,171
and that's not to mention
the nightclub.

859
00:43:11,206 --> 00:43:13,507
You know, l got a crippled
cousin up in New Hampshire...

860
00:43:13,542 --> 00:43:15,909
that's going in for her seventh
operation on her leg, OK?

861
00:43:15,942 --> 00:43:17,218
l got my mother's people
up in Ottawa...

862
00:43:17,254 --> 00:43:18,366
the aunts and the uncles.

863
00:43:18,406 --> 00:43:20,162
These bills add up, Terry, OK?

864
00:43:20,198 --> 00:43:23,646
l'm duly impressed by any and
all charitable contributions.

865
00:43:23,687 --> 00:43:24,865
How crippled?

866
00:43:24,903 --> 00:43:26,725
Did you know you could bet
on lrish hurling?

867
00:43:26,759 --> 00:43:29,126
Hey, hey, hey.
Excuse me, Harvey.

868
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:32,007
l'm trying to figure out
why my partner here...

869
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:33,120
when he wasn't
helping improve...

870
00:43:33,159 --> 00:43:35,615
the Blake family
standard of living...

871
00:43:35,656 --> 00:43:37,728
managed to spend $200,000.

872
00:43:37,768 --> 00:43:39,775
l met a very lovely young
lady from the Netherlands...

873
00:43:39,816 --> 00:43:40,962
down in San Diego...

874
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:41,928
Oh, color me surprised.

875
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:43,586
who took me
to this Oktoberfest deal...

876
00:43:43,624 --> 00:43:45,151
and they had a big parade...

877
00:43:45,192 --> 00:43:47,462
and she wanted to ride
on one of the floats, OK?

878
00:43:47,497 --> 00:43:48,577
So l bought her one.

879
00:43:48,617 --> 00:43:51,912
Now, we're drinking these
big steins of Holland beer...

880
00:43:51,946 --> 00:43:53,123
and one thing leads to another,

881
00:43:53,162 --> 00:43:55,748
and l'm throwing 50-dollar bills
out to the crowd.

882
00:43:57,161 --> 00:43:58,438
The thing about lrish hurling...

883
00:43:58,474 --> 00:44:00,383
is that it's like
football with sticks.

884
00:44:00,426 --> 00:44:01,506
Stop it.

885
00:44:01,547 --> 00:44:05,824
Stop it, please,
for God's sake, Pollard, OK?

886
00:44:06,923 --> 00:44:08,003
OK.

887
00:44:08,043 --> 00:44:10,083
You meet a girl.
You go to a festival.

888
00:44:10,123 --> 00:44:11,618
-October festival.
-Oktoberfest.

889
00:44:11,659 --> 00:44:13,186
You throw 50-dollar bills
to the crowd.

890
00:44:13,227 --> 00:44:14,437
l notice you got
a new gold watch.

891
00:44:14,476 --> 00:44:15,905
This is an 18-karat
gold watch.

892
00:44:15,948 --> 00:44:17,093
l don't give a shit
how many karats it is.

893
00:44:17,132 --> 00:44:18,539
Thirty-six grand.
lt's no big deal.

894
00:44:18,572 --> 00:44:20,099
Did you ever think about
asking somebody for the time?

895
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:21,286
lt's a lot cheaper.

896
00:44:21,324 --> 00:44:22,633
Anything else?

897
00:44:22,669 --> 00:44:23,749
Well, yeah.

898
00:44:23,788 --> 00:44:26,122
We stayed a couple days longer
than l thought we were gonna...

899
00:44:26,157 --> 00:44:27,401
down in San Diego...

900
00:44:27,436 --> 00:44:28,516
and l had to get her
back to the Netherlands...

901
00:44:28,557 --> 00:44:30,946
so l chartered a private jet
to take her home.

902
00:44:30,989 --> 00:44:32,844
Oh, of course you did.

903
00:44:32,878 --> 00:44:34,569
-The Netherlands.
-Yeah.

904
00:44:34,605 --> 00:44:36,678
Joe.

905
00:44:36,718 --> 00:44:37,831
What?

906
00:44:38,766 --> 00:44:39,878
Listen.

907
00:44:42,222 --> 00:44:43,749
Let me try to explain
something to you.

908
00:44:43,791 --> 00:44:46,246
Paradise doesn't
come cheaply, OK?

909
00:44:46,830 --> 00:44:49,383
Now, l've figured this
down to the last nickel.

910
00:44:49,423 --> 00:44:51,398
Now, and here's
the important part...

911
00:44:51,439 --> 00:44:53,162
every nickel that we spend...

912
00:44:53,199 --> 00:44:54,825
is a nickel
that we have to steal.

913
00:44:54,863 --> 00:44:56,172
Now, that's a lot
of nickels, Joe.

914
00:44:56,208 --> 00:44:59,110
l don't want to rob banks
for the rest of my life.

915
00:44:59,152 --> 00:45:02,120
The stress level
is just too damned high.

916
00:45:03,024 --> 00:45:04,431
Harvey?

917
00:45:04,464 --> 00:45:05,544
Joe?

918
00:45:05,584 --> 00:45:06,991
Dinner's almost ready.

919
00:45:08,337 --> 00:45:09,930
Now, this is not bad.

920
00:45:10,897 --> 00:45:12,009
lt's a little--

921
00:45:12,689 --> 00:45:14,577
lt's a little chewy, but--

922
00:45:24,498 --> 00:45:28,176
You boys ever eat and talk
at the same time?

923
00:45:29,586 --> 00:45:31,180
We used to.

924
00:45:35,923 --> 00:45:39,153
So, what sort of work
do you do, crimewise?

925
00:45:39,187 --> 00:45:40,944
Bank robbery.

926
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:42,224
Well, they rob banks.

927
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:43,537
l drive the getaway car.

928
00:45:43,573 --> 00:45:44,685
Harvey.

929
00:45:45,428 --> 00:45:46,858
That's enough, Harvey.

930
00:45:48,725 --> 00:45:49,805
Wait a minute.

931
00:45:49,844 --> 00:45:51,022
You're not the--

932
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:52,751
the guys who go to
the bank manager's house...

933
00:45:52,789 --> 00:45:54,098
you know,
the night before, and you--

934
00:45:54,134 --> 00:45:55,660
They do.
l drive the getaway car.

935
00:45:55,702 --> 00:45:57,327
Harvey!

936
00:45:58,229 --> 00:45:59,822
For the love of God.

937
00:46:03,702 --> 00:46:06,124
You're the Sleepover Bandits.

938
00:46:07,478 --> 00:46:09,867
Oh, my God,
you're practically famous.

939
00:46:09,910 --> 00:46:12,758
The Sleepover Bandits?

940
00:46:12,791 --> 00:46:13,903
That's us?

941
00:46:14,839 --> 00:46:17,141
Don't you watch
''Criminals at Large''?

942
00:46:17,176 --> 00:46:18,485
You should.

943
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:20,243
They're watching you.

944
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:22,036
You're astounding, Harvey.

945
00:46:22,072 --> 00:46:24,014
So...

946
00:46:24,056 --> 00:46:25,365
you rob banks.

947
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:26,611
Well, that's impressive.

948
00:46:26,648 --> 00:46:28,404
What, some little old ladies'
savings accounts...

949
00:46:28,441 --> 00:46:31,507
and Cub Scout dues and homeless
orphan Christmas funds?

950
00:46:31,545 --> 00:46:32,952
ls that what--

951
00:46:35,033 --> 00:46:37,881
We never stole a penny from
anybody who earned it, lady.

952
00:46:39,450 --> 00:46:42,133
That money's federally insured
by the government.

953
00:46:43,674 --> 00:46:44,983
The government
steals money from people...

954
00:46:45,018 --> 00:46:46,742
and we just take it
back from them.

955
00:46:54,395 --> 00:46:56,762
Any more questions, Kate?

956
00:47:05,052 --> 00:47:07,157
Got a spare toothbrush?

957
00:47:07,197 --> 00:47:09,019
Didn't have time to pack.

958
00:47:10,236 --> 00:47:11,763
God, nobody could be that sick.

959
00:47:11,804 --> 00:47:13,692
Put that down.

960
00:47:16,509 --> 00:47:17,753
May l?

961
00:47:18,685 --> 00:47:20,409
What are you doing here?

962
00:47:20,445 --> 00:47:21,525
Cleaning my teeth.

963
00:47:21,565 --> 00:47:23,867
l mean, manic depression...

964
00:47:23,902 --> 00:47:25,877
delusion, l understand
all of that.

965
00:47:25,918 --> 00:47:27,609
lt's very impressive, but--

966
00:47:27,646 --> 00:47:29,534
Do you know how many germs
are on your finger?

967
00:47:29,566 --> 00:47:31,672
That kind of
defeats the purpose.

968
00:47:31,711 --> 00:47:33,020
Well, if you don't
give me a toothbrush...

969
00:47:33,055 --> 00:47:35,127
l don't have much option, do l?

970
00:47:37,887 --> 00:47:40,407
l don't think you're crazy
at all, you knowthat?

971
00:47:40,448 --> 00:47:41,855
l think you're bored.

972
00:47:41,887 --> 00:47:43,797
l think you're bored
with your life...

973
00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:45,727
and you're expecting
that some miracle's...

974
00:47:45,759 --> 00:47:46,839
gonna drop out of the sky...

975
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:49,214
and suddenly make
everything better...

976
00:47:49,248 --> 00:47:52,958
or at least hopeful because
you lost hope a long time ago...

977
00:47:52,992 --> 00:47:54,880
and your marriage sucks.

978
00:47:58,113 --> 00:48:00,535
But l'm sorry, Kate.
We can't help you.

979
00:48:03,426 --> 00:48:04,833
You don't know me.

980
00:48:04,865 --> 00:48:06,459
You only think you do.

981
00:48:08,482 --> 00:48:10,043
You're joking.

982
00:48:10,082 --> 00:48:12,187
Saw it in a movie.

983
00:48:12,227 --> 00:48:14,082
How does it end?

984
00:48:15,267 --> 00:48:16,674
With a wedding.

985
00:48:26,244 --> 00:48:27,837
Beavers and ducks!

986
00:48:29,188 --> 00:48:30,846
Suckers.

987
00:48:30,884 --> 00:48:33,786
l'm not waiting for anything
to fall out of the sky.

988
00:48:33,828 --> 00:48:35,901
l'm not bored. l'm angry.

989
00:48:40,997 --> 00:48:43,299
Maybe he's right
about running out of hope.

990
00:48:43,333 --> 00:48:44,926
lt's not entirely my fault.

991
00:48:45,797 --> 00:48:48,253
lt's just that l picked
the wrong life.

992
00:49:00,295 --> 00:49:02,204
The valley spirit is a woman.

993
00:49:03,399 --> 00:49:05,636
Use her root
at the gateway of heaven...

994
00:49:05,672 --> 00:49:07,679
and it will never fail.

995
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:11,070
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

996
00:49:12,104 --> 00:49:13,217
Not a clue.

997
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:16,065
l'm hoping that it means...

998
00:49:16,105 --> 00:49:18,309
figure out what you want
and just take it.

999
00:49:19,017 --> 00:49:20,577
Oh, please.

1000
00:49:21,321 --> 00:49:24,168
What, like robbing a bank?

1001
00:49:24,201 --> 00:49:25,630
Like that. Yeah.

1002
00:49:26,762 --> 00:49:28,999
lf only life were that simple.

1003
00:49:32,810 --> 00:49:35,680
Like a shadow on me
all of the time

1004
00:49:38,187 --> 00:49:39,748
l don't know what to do.

1005
00:49:40,587 --> 00:49:42,442
l'm always in the dark.

1006
00:49:43,371 --> 00:49:45,925
We're living in a powder keg,
giving off sparks.

1007
00:49:53,645 --> 00:49:57,257
Once upon a time,
l was falling in love.

1008
00:49:57,292 --> 00:49:59,813
Now l'm only falling apart.

1009
00:50:01,133 --> 00:50:02,856
Nothing l can do.

1010
00:50:02,893 --> 00:50:04,487
Total eclipse of the heart.

1011
00:50:11,182 --> 00:50:13,997
Once upon a time,
there was light in my life.

1012
00:50:14,030 --> 00:50:16,267
Nowthere's only
love in the dark.

1013
00:50:17,295 --> 00:50:19,018
Nothing l can do.

1014
00:50:19,055 --> 00:50:20,648
Total eclipse of the heart.

1015
00:50:22,415 --> 00:50:24,520
Oh, my God.

1016
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:25,836
Give me a break.

1017
00:50:26,863 --> 00:50:29,285
Turn around, bright eyes.

1018
00:50:29,904 --> 00:50:31,976
l can't believe
you knowthat song.

1019
00:50:33,616 --> 00:50:34,860
Yeah. Bonnie Tyler.

1020
00:50:34,896 --> 00:50:36,456
''Total Eclipse of the Heart.''

1021
00:50:36,497 --> 00:50:38,384
lt's the ultimate
sappy chick song.

1022
00:50:38,417 --> 00:50:40,457
-lt's not a sappy chick song.
-lt's very sappy.

1023
00:50:40,496 --> 00:50:41,576
No, it's not.

1024
00:50:41,617 --> 00:50:43,111
Oh, please don't argue.
l'm having a really hard day.

1025
00:50:43,153 --> 00:50:44,746
This is the song
that all girls sing--

1026
00:50:44,786 --> 00:50:46,095
lt is an epic haiku to the--

1027
00:50:46,129 --> 00:50:47,078
A what?

1028
00:50:47,121 --> 00:50:49,642
lt's a haiku
to the complexity of love.

1029
00:50:49,682 --> 00:50:52,016
lt's also pretty
embarrassing for guys.

1030
00:50:52,050 --> 00:50:55,214
When that song was out, l used
to listen to it on the radio.

1031
00:50:56,178 --> 00:50:59,975
l have to admit,
l would get a little misty.

1032
00:51:00,019 --> 00:51:01,295
Really?

1033
00:51:01,331 --> 00:51:03,054
Yeah, a little...

1034
00:51:03,539 --> 00:51:07,368
and l would appreciate it if you
didn't mention that to anyone.

1035
00:51:09,044 --> 00:51:11,313
l won't tell a soul.

1036
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:14,922
Thanks.

1037
00:51:26,965 --> 00:51:28,591
That's all right. l'll get it.

1038
00:51:28,629 --> 00:51:29,709
Oh, l'll get it.

1039
00:51:29,750 --> 00:51:33,110
No, no. Why don't you just
stay under the covers there?

1040
00:51:33,110 --> 00:51:35,477
You know what other song
jacked me up when l was a kid?

1041
00:51:35,510 --> 00:51:36,917
That song about the pony,
''Wildfire.''

1042
00:51:36,950 --> 00:51:38,030
You knowthat song?

1043
00:51:38,070 --> 00:51:41,038
Oh, l love that pony song.

1044
00:51:41,079 --> 00:51:42,573
-You do?
-l love all pony songs.

1045
00:51:42,615 --> 00:51:44,022
-Really? You know--
-Yeah.

1046
00:51:44,055 --> 00:51:45,135
lt's the one that goes...

1047
00:51:45,176 --> 00:51:46,932
Ride, pony, ride

1048
00:51:46,967 --> 00:51:48,494
That's ''Mustang Sally.''

1049
00:51:48,535 --> 00:51:49,615
Close. lt's a horse.

1050
00:51:49,656 --> 00:51:50,736
Wasn't the pony called Sally?

1051
00:51:50,776 --> 00:51:52,205
No. This pony
was called Wildfire.

1052
00:51:52,248 --> 00:51:53,841
He busted down the stall.

1053
00:51:54,584 --> 00:51:55,991
Busted down his stall

1054
00:51:56,024 --> 00:51:57,104
You don't remember that?

1055
00:51:57,145 --> 00:51:59,349
And they called him ''Wildfire.''

1056
00:52:04,729 --> 00:52:06,136
Joe?

1057
00:52:06,169 --> 00:52:08,024
Yeah.

1058
00:52:10,138 --> 00:52:12,375
l think l know what l want.

1059
00:52:22,363 --> 00:52:23,857
Amazing.

1060
00:52:42,428 --> 00:52:44,184
Joe, the 24-hour rule...

1061
00:52:44,221 --> 00:52:46,555
is all that stands
between us and chaos.

1062
00:52:48,189 --> 00:52:49,782
Are you listening to me?

1063
00:52:50,685 --> 00:52:52,147
We're at kind of
a crossroads here...

1064
00:52:52,189 --> 00:52:53,848
and l want you to be very clear
about my meaning.

1065
00:52:53,886 --> 00:52:55,893
l'm changing
the 24-hour rule, OK?

1066
00:52:55,934 --> 00:52:57,111
No, no, no.
You don't understand.

1067
00:52:57,150 --> 00:52:58,524
She's a missing person.

1068
00:52:58,558 --> 00:53:00,925
Missing, meaning that someone's
looking for her.

1069
00:53:00,959 --> 00:53:02,039
You get it?

1070
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:04,184
l'm changing the 24-hour rule.

1071
00:53:04,223 --> 00:53:05,499
May l help you?

1072
00:53:06,623 --> 00:53:09,045
Oh, l'm sorry.
We're here to rob your bank.

1073
00:53:12,863 --> 00:53:14,140
What the hell is that?

1074
00:53:14,175 --> 00:53:16,380
lt's a disorder
that affects your ability...

1075
00:53:16,416 --> 00:53:18,587
to regulate
sleep and wakefulness.

1076
00:53:19,328 --> 00:53:20,408
l thought he was dead.

1077
00:53:20,448 --> 00:53:23,896
No. That's cataplexy,
a secondary symptom...

1078
00:53:23,937 --> 00:53:26,806
sudden loss
of voluntary muscle control.

1079
00:53:27,297 --> 00:53:30,047
l just have one question.
Why now?

1080
00:53:30,081 --> 00:53:34,424
ln Lare's case, emotional stress
is the primary ignitor.

1081
00:53:34,466 --> 00:53:37,019
Do you have a guest bedroom
here, ma'am?

1082
00:53:41,282 --> 00:53:43,006
Now we're just gonna ask you
to step right over here...

1083
00:53:43,042 --> 00:53:44,286
in the manager's office.

1084
00:53:44,323 --> 00:53:45,600
Go ahead.

1085
00:53:45,635 --> 00:53:48,603
You never know what's gonna
happen during a robbery.

1086
00:53:48,643 --> 00:53:50,017
-That's the thing.
-Sure, sure.

1087
00:53:50,051 --> 00:53:52,124
There's always a surprise
of some kind...

1088
00:53:52,163 --> 00:53:53,341
l mean, you know,
beyond your control...

1089
00:53:53,379 --> 00:53:55,932
but, l mean, the thing is that
you have to remain calm...

1090
00:53:55,972 --> 00:53:57,248
-under pressure...
-That's right.

1091
00:53:57,284 --> 00:53:58,364
and think on your feet.

1092
00:53:58,404 --> 00:53:59,484
No, no.

1093
00:53:59,524 --> 00:54:00,801
All l'm saying is it just seems
a little silly...

1094
00:54:00,836 --> 00:54:02,560
falling asleep
during a bank robbery.

1095
00:54:02,596 --> 00:54:04,123
Well, it may appear
silly to you...

1096
00:54:04,165 --> 00:54:06,466
but there's a perfectly
reasonable explanation.

1097
00:54:09,381 --> 00:54:10,690
Done.

1098
00:54:11,558 --> 00:54:13,151
l'm sorry. l'm a little nervous.

1099
00:54:13,189 --> 00:54:14,466
lt's OK, Larry.

1100
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:16,257
There's nothing
to be nervous about.

1101
00:54:17,285 --> 00:54:20,930
You see, my body chemistry
is extraordinarily sensitive...

1102
00:54:20,966 --> 00:54:22,242
to suggestion.

1103
00:54:22,278 --> 00:54:24,995
Any symptom can be manufactured,
given the right circumstances...

1104
00:54:25,030 --> 00:54:26,819
and that, by the way,
doesn't mean that it isn't real.

1105
00:54:28,199 --> 00:54:30,435
Jesus, this stuff is hot.

1106
00:54:32,711 --> 00:54:35,167
Go get Mrs. Fife.

1107
00:54:35,208 --> 00:54:36,320
So l met this girl...

1108
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:38,880
and, you know, l wanted
to impress her, so l said...

1109
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:41,091
''You want to see me
light my hands on fire?''

1110
00:54:41,128 --> 00:54:42,305
You know, because
l bet she'd never seen...

1111
00:54:42,344 --> 00:54:44,166
anything like that before...

1112
00:54:44,201 --> 00:54:46,176
and she said,
''Well, what about your head?''

1113
00:54:46,217 --> 00:54:47,232
-l said, ''Look--''
-Your head?

1114
00:54:47,273 --> 00:54:48,200
Yeah, my head.

1115
00:54:48,233 --> 00:54:49,443
Like, l don't have
the proper gear...

1116
00:54:49,481 --> 00:54:51,620
for that kind of stunt,
at least not yet.

1117
00:54:51,657 --> 00:54:54,723
l said, ''No way,'' but she
wouldn't listen, you know?

1118
00:54:54,762 --> 00:54:57,129
Flaming hands wasn't enough.

1119
00:54:57,161 --> 00:54:58,984
She wanted to see me
set my head on fire.

1120
00:54:59,017 --> 00:55:00,261
So what did you do?

1121
00:55:00,842 --> 00:55:02,751
Singed off half my hair.

1122
00:55:03,530 --> 00:55:05,024
Little bit more, sweetheart.

1123
00:55:05,067 --> 00:55:06,147
Here you go.

1124
00:55:06,187 --> 00:55:07,332
-ls he coming around?
-Yes.

1125
00:55:07,370 --> 00:55:09,891
Because--because we really
need him to come around.

1126
00:55:09,930 --> 00:55:11,010
He's coming around.

1127
00:55:11,051 --> 00:55:12,131
Do you understand?
We don't have much time.

1128
00:55:12,171 --> 00:55:13,284
This is ridiculous.

1129
00:55:13,995 --> 00:55:15,075
lt's the emotion thing.

1130
00:55:15,115 --> 00:55:16,261
Nervous breakdown here.

1131
00:55:17,836 --> 00:55:19,243
Guys, we have a problem.

1132
00:55:19,276 --> 00:55:21,927
We got multiple bogies
at nine o'clock.

1133
00:55:23,948 --> 00:55:25,192
What the hell is that?

1134
00:55:25,229 --> 00:55:26,723
lt's the drive-up window.

1135
00:55:26,764 --> 00:55:28,041
Someone's at the drive-up.

1136
00:55:28,076 --> 00:55:29,353
At 8:00 in the morning?

1137
00:55:31,085 --> 00:55:32,295
-What do we do?
-Nothing.

1138
00:55:32,333 --> 00:55:33,445
Hello?

1139
00:55:34,990 --> 00:55:36,550
l'm telling you,
you act too eager like that...

1140
00:55:36,590 --> 00:55:38,728
and Dottie's never gonna
give you a second look.

1141
00:55:38,766 --> 00:55:42,214
Women do not respond to need.

1142
00:55:44,654 --> 00:55:46,214
lt's the police.

1143
00:55:49,902 --> 00:55:51,179
Good morning.

1144
00:55:53,679 --> 00:55:55,054
Where's Dottie?

1145
00:55:55,087 --> 00:55:56,429
Who?

1146
00:55:56,464 --> 00:55:58,187
The drive-up girl.

1147
00:55:58,703 --> 00:56:00,526
Oh, l'm sorry.
Dottie. Of course.

1148
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:03,430
Uh, she's sick.

1149
00:56:03,472 --> 00:56:04,966
Sick with what?

1150
00:56:05,008 --> 00:56:06,633
Vaginitis.

1151
00:56:07,248 --> 00:56:10,216
She's been suffering from
an abnormal vaginal discharge.

1152
00:56:10,257 --> 00:56:11,501
lt's a common symptom...

1153
00:56:11,537 --> 00:56:14,122
a viscous fluid usually
associated with, uh...

1154
00:56:14,161 --> 00:56:16,233
well, vaginitis.

1155
00:56:16,913 --> 00:56:18,320
This usually
is associated with--

1156
00:56:27,762 --> 00:56:29,355
All clear, Bubba.

1157
00:56:29,395 --> 00:56:30,507
You all right?

1158
00:56:30,547 --> 00:56:31,627
That was great.

1159
00:56:31,667 --> 00:56:32,594
lt's exciting, right?

1160
00:56:32,627 --> 00:56:33,772
Yeah.

1161
00:56:38,259 --> 00:56:40,081
Why a college parking lot?

1162
00:56:40,116 --> 00:56:41,490
Always lots of cars around...

1163
00:56:41,524 --> 00:56:42,702
even in the morning.

1164
00:56:42,740 --> 00:56:44,464
Leave the Jaguar here.

1165
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:45,874
No gambling.

1166
00:56:48,661 --> 00:56:50,930
l'll see you in Tonopah
in two weeks, you understand?

1167
00:56:50,965 --> 00:56:52,045
-Yeah. All right.
-Two weeks.

1168
00:56:52,085 --> 00:56:53,361
You hear me?

1169
00:57:02,390 --> 00:57:03,732
He'll get tired of her.

1170
00:57:03,766 --> 00:57:05,676
lt just takes time. You'll see.

1171
00:57:05,718 --> 00:57:08,620
l don't know.
Kate's a special lady.

1172
00:57:09,238 --> 00:57:11,791
Kate is an iceberg
waiting for the Titanic.

1173
00:57:14,134 --> 00:57:15,989
Has anybody seen Kate Wheeler?

1174
00:57:16,023 --> 00:57:17,103
Local authorities...

1175
00:57:17,143 --> 00:57:18,354
are investigating
the possible connection...

1176
00:57:18,391 --> 00:57:19,635
between the missing woman...

1177
00:57:19,671 --> 00:57:21,395
and the latest in a series
of bank robberies...

1178
00:57:21,431 --> 00:57:22,893
committed by
the Sleepover Bandits.

1179
00:57:22,935 --> 00:57:25,489
Wheeler vanished just 24 hours
before the robbery...

1180
00:57:25,528 --> 00:57:26,957
of the San Andreas Bank.

1181
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,750
Her abandoned automobile was
discovered a short distance...

1182
00:57:29,785 --> 00:57:32,468
from the automobile belonging
to bank manager Lawrence Fife.

1183
00:57:32,505 --> 00:57:35,320
But a much bigger question
remains unanswered, people.

1184
00:57:35,353 --> 00:57:37,809
Who exactly
are these mystery men?

1185
00:57:37,849 --> 00:57:39,093
ln a related development...

1186
00:57:39,129 --> 00:57:40,471
a federal task force
has been assembled...

1187
00:57:40,506 --> 00:57:42,448
to try to piece together
this whole mystery.

1188
00:57:42,489 --> 00:57:44,148
ls there a connection
between the missing woman...

1189
00:57:44,186 --> 00:57:45,299
and the Sleepover Bandits?

1190
00:57:45,338 --> 00:57:47,509
ls Kate Wheeler associated
with the Sleepover Bandits...

1191
00:57:47,546 --> 00:57:48,626
or is she part of the gang?

1192
00:57:48,666 --> 00:57:49,844
We'll keep you updated...

1193
00:57:49,882 --> 00:57:54,007
right here as this whole story
unfolds on ''Criminals at Large.''

1194
00:58:34,942 --> 00:58:35,870
Harvey?

1195
00:58:35,902 --> 00:58:36,982
Yeah?

1196
00:58:37,023 --> 00:58:39,674
Do you remember what l said
about conspicuous behavior?

1197
00:58:39,711 --> 00:58:41,751
Keeping a low profile.

1198
00:58:41,792 --> 00:58:43,450
Are you achieving it,
do you think?

1199
00:58:43,487 --> 00:58:44,415
You bet.

1200
00:58:44,447 --> 00:58:45,560
Good boy.

1201
00:58:46,463 --> 00:58:47,958
What do you think of my boots?

1202
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,888
Very lifelike.
