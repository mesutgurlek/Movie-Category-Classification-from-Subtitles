1			
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:56,913			 
THE GREAT DEBATES			
			
2			
00:01:09,636 --> 00:01:12,161			
Every Father Almighty,			
			
3			
00:01:12,472 --> 00:01:17,375			
... I stand before the Ti with all the humility of the world.			
			
4			
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,478			
Father who controls all things.			
			
5
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:25,547
The life and death of all creatures

6
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:30,348
It gives us strength and wisdom to
Make your work

7
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:35,656
And allow to do it
For the good of all.

8
00:01:36,963 --> 00:01:38,555
Amen

9
00:02:01,354 --> 00:02:04,016
When all this ends,
Be a little better.

10
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:07,757
-- I say that this was not the final.
-- Because it seems that took their revenge

11
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:11,895
-- It was better than Henry.
-- You know what I have here?

12
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:13,230
What?

13
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:14,966
Something to you

14
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:19,229
As a boy, he spoke as a boy.

15
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:24,341
Entendia as boy

16
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:27,777
I thought as a boy

17
00:02:28,748 --> 00:02:30,943
But when I became a man,

18
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:34,183
... I get back all
Things for boys.

19
00:02:57,877 --> 00:02:59,208
Class of Year 1,

20
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:03,408
... I believe that we are the most
Lucky in America.

21
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:08,615
Because we have the
Work more importantly,

22
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:11,856
... Of America.

23
00:03:13,426 --> 00:03:16,918
The education of our children.

24
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:47,648
What there?

25
00:03:48,861 --> 00:03:49,759
Devils Who is he?

26
00:03:49,996 --> 00:03:51,463
It is only my husband.

27
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:57,001
I will cut your head.

28
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:00,906
We must teach our children.

29
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:06,511
What faced many difficulties.

30
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:11,308
It is not so bad, is it?

31
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:13,410
Believes that as
Twice as much as me?

32
00:04:13,653 --> 00:04:15,416
They should defeat them

33
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:21,452
Devam doing what
Should be done

34
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:24,753
... To be able to do what they want

35
00:04:31,337 --> 00:04:34,363
Education is the only way out.

36
00:04:37,243 --> 00:04:39,336
Let's lift bay, lift.

37
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:42,070
The output of ignorance.

38
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:44,539
Like to cut us?

39
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:46,279
Like to cut, hein?

40
00:04:48,187 --> 00:04:49,347
Get your hands for me!

41
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:52,056
The output of obscurity

42
00:04:57,864 --> 00:05:03,302
It will be a glorious light.

43
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:52,683
Let us return, return.

44
00:05:52,952 --> 00:05:55,147
- To our dear Hamilton.
-- This is not legal.

45
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:58,150
Me returns

46
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:20,904
They are

47
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:27,809
That's me,

48
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:31,619
... The darker imão

49
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:34,025
Me send eat in the kitchen
When the company comes

50
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:38,026
But I river, but how well and creço strong.

51
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:42,158
Tomorrow I sentarei the table
When the company reached

52
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:46,264
Nothing is dare to tell me
That coma in the kitchen

53
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:51,736
In addition to that, you will see that I am beautiful.

54
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:54,139
And if envergonharam

55
00:06:54,947 --> 00:06:58,781
I too am America

56
00:07:00,987 --> 00:07:02,477
Who wrote that?

57
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:05,584
Martin Hughes, 1924.

58
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:07,416
1925.

59
00:07:08,694 --> 00:07:11,629
You hate to be a game

60
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:15,126
What is done with hands full

61
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:19,803
The memory will put in their hands

62
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:22,331
... On your chest

63
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:26,203
And you entederás my hate.

64
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:28,510
Gwendolin Bennet wrote that.

65
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:31,316
She was born in 1902

66
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:33,846
Outside the records

67
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,210
Summer in most states

68
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:39,523
The blacks are denied
The certificate of birth

69
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,954
From what I can deny my
Age for the rest of my life.

70
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:44,357
Believe that I am funny?

71
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:49,731
Born without registration.

72
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:53,335
Mr. Reed, distribute it.

73
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:57,171
I shall to you the news
This emestre

74
00:07:57,543 --> 00:08:00,273
There is a revolution in the north.

75
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,312
In Harlow, are changing the way,

76
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,016
... To think of blacks in America

77
00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:07,275
I am speaking of people
As Hughes, Bennett,

78
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:10,287
... Zora Neale Hurston, Collin County.

79
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:15,691
Me food with a spoon,
Silver with the stars and sky.

80
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:18,120
Corto my teeth as
A black guaxinim

81
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:20,691
The implements of war

82
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,407
Me find after class.

83
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:43,115
What makes a teacher
In the middle of the night,

84
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:45,117
... Dressed as a peasant?

85
00:08:45,758 --> 00:08:48,955
What does a student in the middle of the
Night looking to lose their lives?

86
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:50,820
What strange, I thought
I was defending me.

87
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:54,828
I remember

88
00:08:56,335 --> 00:08:58,565
Some years ago
When disappeared.

89
00:08:59,338 --> 00:09:00,305
What was?

90
00:09:00,773 --> 00:09:03,071
And I will come when I will.

91
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:05,066
Te suspended?
-- Asked license.

92
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:08,478
Why again?

93
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:10,883
At school is the only place
Where you can read all day.

94
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:12,511
Except the prison.

95
00:09:15,688 --> 00:09:18,282
I want my will
Home tonight at 7:30.

96
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:19,719
It is at the corner of Junhos and Campos

97
00:09:19,926 --> 00:09:20,688
Why would it?

98
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:22,417
We are recruiting for
A team of debate.

99
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:26,330
Are you sure you want someone like me?

100
00:09:26,632 --> 00:09:29,624
No, why will the evidence.

101
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:33,695
At 7:30, and Junhos Campos.

102
00:09:59,231 --> 00:10:02,632
Levado by the wind and rain.

103
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:07,130
He and the Junior today.

104
00:10:12,044 --> 00:10:14,535
Of the 360 students here
At the University of Wiley.

105
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:16,237
Only 45 of these were
Brave to come,

106
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:18,081
... The evidence of the team of debate.

107
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:22,252
Of the 45 only 4 left here
When the tests end.

108
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:25,584
Why? Because the debate
Is a esprte of war.

109
00:10:25,858 --> 00:10:29,055
It is a fight, but his weapons are words.

110
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:32,256
Enter ... Now that you
Farmer came can begin.

111
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:36,260
Do you feel Mr. Farmer ...
Not there, there.

112
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:41,066
-- Good evening sra. Tolson.
-- Good evening.

113
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:45,403
-- We hope you sir.
-- Will I have.

114
00:10:45,711 --> 00:10:48,271
Thank you, smells good sr. Farmer.

115
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:50,774
-- Thank you.
-- From nothing.

116
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:52,681
Ladies and senhorita.

117
00:10:53,185 --> 00:10:56,279
This is the place,

118
00:10:58,591 --> 00:11:00,081
... Hot.

119
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:03,228
Entered running because wanted.

120
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:05,628
Mr Tolson, and the debates
Last year?

121
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:07,264
Do not ask what they already know.

122
00:11:07,566 --> 00:11:09,727
Get up, will be the first,
Here in the hot zone.

123
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:13,269
The debate begins with a
Proposal, with an idea.

124
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:17,239
The boys must work in
If regular government.

125
00:11:17,943 --> 00:11:20,241
The first debate
Speaks positively.

126
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:21,936
So will agree.

127
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:24,673
Mr Reed, speak
Positive, the second the negative.

128
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:27,884
-- What is bad?
-- What are against.

129
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:29,348
Brilliant sr. Burgess.

130
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,850
Falará positively
Sr. Reed, start.

131
00:11:32,758 --> 00:11:36,558
Well, start with a
Quote the poet Claycoin.

132
00:11:37,496 --> 00:11:41,262
The flowers born so close to the mill.

133
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:46,971
What almost all boys
That work can see.

134
00:11:47,306 --> 00:11:53,108
-- Y, Y..
-- What was in that minute?

135
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,478
It was learned that
Last year sr Reed?

136
00:11:56,982 --> 00:11:59,507
Start something and not finish, it was so?

137
00:11:59,985 --> 00:12:02,010
-- No sir.
-- They are.

138
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:09,820
Who will be the next?
You, lift, lift.

139
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:15,466
If it is late, as
More if you hide?

140
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:16,827
I am not hiding me sir.

141
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:19,266
Me transferring from my university
To come to the evidence.

142
00:12:19,538 --> 00:12:20,732
I am very excited, as if called?

143
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:22,938
-- Samantha Booke.
-- Booke?

144
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:26,968
-- A "and" at the end.
-- From Miss Booke footing with "and".

145
00:12:28,547 --> 00:12:32,142
Among the hot zone
Miss Bookde with an "e".

146
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:36,647
You know that there has never been a woman
The team of debate, never?

147
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:38,746
Yes, I know you.

148
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:40,653
What makes you think
You could be the first?

149
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:44,357
-- Because I am as smart as ...
-- Not speak it.

150
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,588
-... Any other person.
-- The theme senhorita.

151
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:48,960
Social assistance
Desestimula the hard work.

152
00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:51,770
-- Do you speak negatively.
-- Well

153
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:56,567
Assistance strip of man
A stronger reason to work.

154
00:12:57,309 --> 00:12:58,606
What is survival.

155
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:04,015
And it weakens the will of
Poor, as refutaria that?

156
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,517
I would say not.

157
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:10,446
Most of this goes to the
Children and the disabled.

158
00:13:10,756 --> 00:13:12,815
-... And people bigger.
-- That is a conjecture or a fact?

159
00:13:13,025 --> 00:13:14,117
-- It is a fact.
-- Highest.

160
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,521
-- It is a fact.
-- What is your source?

161
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:18,729
-- The Chairman.
-- Of the United States?

162
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:20,226
Yes, sir.

163
00:13:20,432 --> 00:13:21,626
That is their main source?

164
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:23,233
.... Spoke with the president
Roosevelt in person?

165
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:25,828
Of course not speak with him personally.

166
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:27,834
But the ever hear.

167
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,435
-- In a radio transmission?
-- Yes

168
00:13:30,676 --> 00:13:33,440
Some other source? Some other?

169
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,276
Yes, there are other sources,

170
00:13:39,285 --> 00:13:41,685
... Look like the eyes of a mother
That can not feed their children.

171
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:45,488
Without the assistance sr. Tolson,
Morreriam people from hunger.

172
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:47,952
-- Who would die of hunger?
-- The unemployed.

173
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,459
The sr. Burgess is unemployed
And as you can see not died of starvation.

174
00:13:53,265 --> 00:13:55,165
I have a shot of you senhorita Booke.

175
00:13:56,101 --> 00:13:59,195
Me deêm real facts to
I syllogism not fall.

176
00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:01,598
-- Silogismo?
-- His logic that speaks.

177
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:03,707
Principal premise,
Desemprecados die of hunger.

178
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:05,638
Minor premise,
The sr. Burgess is unemployed.

179
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:08,946
Conclusion, sr. Burgess
Is dying of hunger.

180
00:14:09,114 --> 00:14:11,105
Its main premise was
Based on a mistaken belief.

181
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:12,811
Falácia classic.

182
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:15,147
Who is next?

183
00:14:21,727 --> 00:14:22,819
Esteve well.

184
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:27,356
-- Say you.
-- Henryu Lowe with a "u".

185
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:32,828
Okay, sir. Lowe, I shall the matter,
You speak it.

186
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:34,164
Is there any citation of the literature.

187
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,864
Ahead.

188
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:39,644
Beauty.

189
00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:43,946
I heard the Lord say
That all beauty is passing,

190
00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:45,443
... As the water.

191
00:14:46,085 --> 00:14:48,144
Very good, history.

192
00:14:48,854 --> 00:14:50,754
And the author's name this time.

193
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:53,251
The story is a pesadêlo
I want to wake up.

194
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:55,349
James Joyce.

195
00:14:58,464 --> 00:15:00,159
Pena itself.

196
00:15:03,602 --> 00:15:06,537
Never saw things wild
Feel sorry for themselves

197
00:15:07,706 --> 00:15:09,105
D. H. Lawrence.

198
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:14,108
Me encanta D. H.
Lawrence, already read?

199
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:16,804
-- Mr. Farmer.
-- Yes, sir.

200
00:15:17,516 --> 00:15:19,950
I have eyes on the neck and
Heard on all sides.

201
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,411
Get up.

202
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:26,623
Tell me the irony in the name.
Bethlehem Steel Corporation

203
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:33,228
Bethlehem is where
Jesus was born, after the peace.

204
00:15:33,832 --> 00:15:36,426
And Bethlehem however does
Pra war weapons.

205
00:15:37,236 --> 00:15:38,760
Well, sit down.

206
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,632
Who next?

207
00:15:46,578 --> 00:15:48,136
Samantha.

208
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:55,149
The sr. Tolson is very tough, no?

209
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:57,148
I am sure it is.

210
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:00,625
My name is James.

211
00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:03,723
Your father is Dr. James Farmer?

212
00:16:04,096 --> 00:16:05,723
Yes, it does.

213
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:09,597
I hear the most and that
Man as speaking languages.

214
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:12,996
French, Greek, Hebrew,
Latin, who speak languages?

215
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:16,531
-- Some languages.
-- Only a few.

216
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,835
Must be the man most
Intelligent Texas.

217
00:16:21,046 --> 00:16:22,809
Not so, it is exaggeration.

218
00:16:23,515 --> 00:16:24,948
So you want to be on the team?

219
00:16:26,118 --> 00:16:28,245
It would be a good entertainment.

220
00:16:28,854 --> 00:16:31,345
-- What?
-- Be lawyer.

221
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:34,718
Lawyer? It is genial.

222
00:16:35,427 --> 00:16:37,725
You know how many women are
Lawyers in the United States?

223
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:39,653
-- Two.
-- Exactly.

224
00:16:39,965 --> 00:16:41,023
One is beautiful.

225
00:16:42,234 --> 00:16:45,135
Look sr. Farmer, which his age?

226
00:16:45,871 --> 00:16:47,429
I am 16.

227
00:16:48,874 --> 00:16:50,068
In 21 months.

228
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:54,642
Miss, James, only
I wanted to thank.

229
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:58,041
-- Why?
-- By their actions today.

230
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:00,379
How many other students
Tolson faced?

231
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,779
-- I did not.
-- No, you answered a question.

232
00:17:02,988 --> 00:17:04,182
And I just said a few citations.

233
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,321
But the senhorita Brooke with an "e".

234
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:09,890
-- She fought.
-- And lost.

235
00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:14,833
But it has to lose by
It is not their legitimate source?

236
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:17,196
Because Tolson said.

237
00:17:17,936 --> 00:17:21,895
Nobody has better access to
Statistics that the President.

238
00:17:23,842 --> 00:17:25,833
If I had said that
The Tolson, would have gained.

239
00:17:27,112 --> 00:17:30,240
I do not know with certainty
Something would have happened.

240
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:33,141
Good evening James.

241
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:37,420
You can believe that has 14
Years and is the university?

242
00:17:40,025 --> 00:17:41,925
They are privileged, everyone.

243
00:17:42,761 --> 00:17:44,922
Once you should know that chose
This team for the balance.

244
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:46,859
... And nobody should
Taken as a failure.

245
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:50,425
As denigrição of his intellect.

246
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:52,168
Denigrição, you get another word.

247
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:56,030
From Latin niger, deny,
Black is always present.

248
00:17:56,341 --> 00:17:59,833
There is in the dictionary, there is no
Speech of a black teacher.

249
00:18:00,712 --> 00:18:04,773
Somehow the black
Always been associated with the failure.

250
00:18:05,484 --> 00:18:09,386
Write your own dictionary and
Marquem as a new beginning.

251
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:12,086
If form part of the team or not.

252
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:17,893
The society of the University
Wiley, of 1935-36, is well.

253
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:21,794
The member of the team of debate will be.

254
00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:24,696
The sr. Hamilton Burgess,
The team last year.

255
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:26,603
Do you feel sr. Burgess.

256
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:29,938
The sr. Henry Lowe.

257
00:18:32,344 --> 00:18:36,337
Our alternating, senhorita
Samantha Booke with an "e".

258
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:39,915
And finally.

259
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:44,148
Junior, slower.

260
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:46,950
-- And Daddy?
-- Silence is writing.

261
00:18:50,929 --> 00:18:52,760
-- Daddy.
-- Junior.

262
00:18:53,532 --> 00:18:56,057
What is the greatest difficulty
Of a great man?

263
00:18:58,737 --> 00:19:00,500
Do not believe the doubt.

264
00:19:01,173 --> 00:19:06,668
It is therefore obliged Junior, 1914-31.

265
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:08,973
This will be a lesson.

266
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:12,112
-- Daddy.
-- Te I somewhat of faith.

267
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,976
What doubt?

268
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:18,078
-- Daddy.
-- What was child?

269
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:20,023
Entered in the team of debate.

270
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:24,523
Congratulations, and who is on your team?

271
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:28,494
We are 4, I am one of the alternating.

272
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:30,524
Who are you?

273
00:19:30,802 --> 00:19:32,497
Hamilton Burgess and Henry Lowe.

274
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:34,600
And another is alternating Samantha Booke

275
00:19:35,707 --> 00:19:38,232
-- Are you a girl?
-- Want to be lawyer.

276
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:41,943
-- Lawyer?
-- She is very intelligent.

277
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:46,212
It is beautiful?

278
00:19:47,653 --> 00:19:49,917
I do not know, the ever seen.

279
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:53,819
Because the activities
Extracurricular are very important.

280
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:56,117
But no need for neglecting your purpose.

281
00:19:56,628 --> 00:19:57,925
Yes, sir.

282
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:02,225
Then we do here?

283
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:05,529
We do what we need to
Do what you want.

284
00:20:06,238 --> 00:20:08,672
-- What we have to do now?
-- My task

285
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:11,338
-- Go do it.
-- Yes, sir.

286
00:20:21,653 --> 00:20:24,747
Papi bought many
Bananas, apples, cookies,

287
00:20:24,957 --> 00:20:28,256
... Eggs, lines, pigs and gonzolabis.

288
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:31,891
-- Gonzolabis.
-- What is it?

289
00:20:32,264 --> 00:20:34,459
Perdiz, partridge.

290
00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:37,960
We will, we will.

291
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:42,103
-- Abricó.
-- We will, we will.

292
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:43,669
Caution.

293
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,677
What was that?

294
00:20:50,515 --> 00:20:51,880
Not sure.

295
00:21:02,628 --> 00:21:03,925
Stay here.

296
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:17,131
-- What is it?
-- A pig.

297
00:21:18,677 --> 00:21:19,939
Only a pig.

298
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:20,940
Cala mouth dog!

299
00:21:22,748 --> 00:21:23,942
Junior into the car.

300
00:21:24,249 --> 00:21:26,683
-- What hell was that?
-- Sorry.

301
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:29,378
Out of a sudden, there you saw coming.

302
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:33,751
-- Matou him.
-- Sorry, you paid.

303
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,953
As both?

304
00:21:39,264 --> 00:21:41,357
T cost 25 US dollars.

305
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,663
I have a few US dollars now but I can ...

306
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:55,374
But I have a check.

307
00:21:56,181 --> 00:21:58,081
My monthly check of
University of Wiley.

308
00:21:58,884 --> 00:22:00,943
They are 17 US dollars and 36 cents.

309
00:22:02,054 --> 00:22:05,114
You can get this,
And I endorsement.

310
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:08,749
It will what?

311
00:22:09,961 --> 00:22:12,623
That the assinarei to you.

312
00:22:13,465 --> 00:22:16,127
-- Let me see.
-- You are in the car.

313
00:22:18,737 --> 00:22:20,170
Let me in the car now.

314
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:26,439
Junior into the car.

315
00:22:34,052 --> 00:22:36,987
-- Give me the check.
-- We need this money.

316
00:22:38,056 --> 00:22:41,082
Just give me the check, we will.

317
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:49,063
I believe it was here.

318
00:22:49,301 --> 00:22:51,599
Relax, okay, find.

319
00:22:53,472 --> 00:22:55,099
Here is.

320
00:23:04,516 --> 00:23:06,006
It is better that this cheque is good.

321
00:23:06,518 --> 00:23:07,712
It is.

322
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,557
Well, take it.

323
00:23:32,844 --> 00:23:34,835
Wait, where will believe?

324
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,843
You must help us
Put it in the truck.

325
00:23:37,682 --> 00:23:39,149
We will hold the neck of the boy

326
00:23:43,455 --> 00:23:44,547
In three.

327
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:50,185
Malditos blacks of the city,
Do not want to be dirty.

328
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:10,138
-- Daddy.
-- Te said pra enter the car.

329
00:24:10,515 --> 00:24:13,712
When you get to say
Something has to do.

330
00:24:17,656 --> 00:24:19,715
-- Who is the judge?
-- The judge is God.

331
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,114
Why is God?

332
00:24:21,526 --> 00:24:25,018
Because decide who
Won and the opposition.

333
00:24:25,363 --> 00:24:27,763
-- And who are your opponents?
-- No.

334
00:24:28,066 --> 00:24:29,328
Why not there?

335
00:24:29,534 --> 00:24:32,128
Because in the valley know.

336
00:24:32,838 --> 00:24:34,135
Who is the judge?

337
00:24:34,372 --> 00:24:35,737
The judge is God.

338
00:24:36,241 --> 00:24:37,367
Why?

339
00:24:37,742 --> 00:24:40,939
Because decide who
Won and the opposition.

340
00:24:41,246 --> 00:24:43,180
-- And who are your opponents?
-- No.

341
00:24:43,682 --> 00:24:45,240
Why not there?

342
00:24:45,584 --> 00:24:49,179
Why not worth knowing.

343
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:52,353
Who is the judge?

344
00:24:52,557 --> 00:24:53,751
The judge is God.

345
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:54,948
Why?

346
00:24:55,193 --> 00:24:58,959
Because decide who
Won and the opposition.

347
00:24:59,197 --> 00:25:01,290
-- And who are your opponents?
-- No.

348
00:25:01,533 --> 00:25:02,591
Why not there?

349
00:25:02,901 --> 00:25:06,200
Why not worth knowing.

350
00:25:06,538 --> 00:25:07,596
Who is the judge?

351
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:09,500
-- The judge is God.
-- Highest.

352
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:11,232
The judge is God.

353
00:25:11,543 --> 00:25:12,601
Why?

354
00:25:12,811 --> 00:25:15,712
Because decide who
Won and the opposition.

355
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:17,743
-- And who are your opponents?
-- No.

356
00:25:18,049 --> 00:25:19,607
Why not there?

357
00:25:19,818 --> 00:25:22,946
Why not worth knowing.

358
00:25:23,221 --> 00:25:24,245
Let us with the truth

359
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:25,547
Let us with the truth

360
00:25:26,124 --> 00:25:27,318
Yes I would like you to speak.

361
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:29,019
That is a virtue or a vice?

362
00:25:29,828 --> 00:25:33,764
I have to admit that whenever
Wanted to be mysterious and silent.

363
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:36,228
However, I can not keep silent.

364
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:38,833
Entraria a fight
Street sr. Burgess?

365
00:25:40,472 --> 00:25:41,530
No sir.

366
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:43,230
So please do not
A fight of words.

367
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:45,365
There has to deceive yourself.

368
00:25:46,177 --> 00:25:48,873
Use your mood against your opponent.

369
00:25:50,081 --> 00:25:52,174
-- Mr. Farmer.
-- Yes sir.

370
00:25:54,252 --> 00:25:57,653
Mr. Happy Farmer, tell us
Something that we do not know about her father.

371
00:25:58,256 --> 00:26:02,283
-- He was the first black with a PhD.
-- Something that we do not know, sir. Farmer.

372
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:10,093
Caminhou of Florida to Massachusetts,
Go to the University of Boston.

373
00:26:10,135 --> 00:26:13,127
If formed Magnum Kum Laude.

374
00:26:14,205 --> 00:26:15,399
Mr. Lowe.

375
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:20,904
Tell us of your father.

376
00:26:21,613 --> 00:26:23,342
Why not something on account of his father?

377
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:25,906
We know sr. Lowe.

378
00:26:26,318 --> 00:26:27,512
And I tried, you know.

379
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:29,509
I am not in the team of debate.

380
00:26:29,821 --> 00:26:31,118
We are not discussing now.

381
00:26:33,325 --> 00:26:34,622
Well

382
00:26:36,061 --> 00:26:37,858
I take the initiative.

383
00:26:41,032 --> 00:26:44,331
Take the black evil and more restless.

384
00:26:45,971 --> 00:26:48,667
Take the clothes ...
In front of other blacks,

385
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,532
... Women, men and children.

386
00:26:51,242 --> 00:26:53,972
Pass Pitch and plumes,
Amarrem in each leg,

387
00:26:54,245 --> 00:26:55,837
.... A horse going
In the opposite direction.

388
00:26:56,147 --> 00:26:58,138
Prendam fire onto the horses,

389
00:26:58,483 --> 00:27:00,075
... Until they leave the half.

390
00:27:01,186 --> 00:27:03,780
Faced men,
Black women and children.

391
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:08,225
Give chicotadas coups and the
Black men who fall.

392
00:27:08,426 --> 00:27:09,893
Almost to death but not kill.

393
00:27:10,228 --> 00:27:12,219
But release the fury
Of God on them.

394
00:27:12,497 --> 00:27:14,988
Because they can be
Useful for creating later.

395
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,099
Does anyone know who was
I said that?

396
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:18,997
Raise your hand, anyone?

397
00:27:19,404 --> 00:27:21,235
It was a perverse owner of
Slaves in West, Virginia.

398
00:27:22,007 --> 00:27:24,805
The foremen of
Colonies have problems,

399
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:26,807
... Controlling the slaves.

400
00:27:27,012 --> 00:27:29,344
Once you bruscaram
Linch to indicate their methods.

401
00:27:30,515 --> 00:27:33,712
The word linchar came from his nickname.

402
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:36,919
His methods were very
Simple but diabolical.

403
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:40,416
Matinham the slaves
Physically strong.

404
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:43,453
But weak psicológicamente
And dependent on the owner.

405
00:27:44,362 --> 00:27:46,956
They remove the body and the mind.

406
00:27:49,134 --> 00:27:50,931
I

407
00:27:51,236 --> 00:27:53,261
... And all other
Teachers in this university.

408
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:56,329
We are here to help you.

409
00:27:58,777 --> 00:28:02,577
... To find, retrieve and maintain,

410
00:28:03,081 --> 00:28:04,571
... Your mind.

411
00:28:06,384 --> 00:28:09,080
Because obviously lost.

412
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:13,787
That is all you need
Learn from me Sr. Lowe.

413
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:19,995
They can go.

414
00:30:08,773 --> 00:30:10,172
-- Want to dance?
-- I.

415
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:13,235
Come on.

416
00:30:29,794 --> 00:30:31,261
It is a good dancer.

417
00:30:31,963 --> 00:30:35,057
Thank you, in my practice room.

418
00:30:36,801 --> 00:30:38,268
Keep practicing.

419
00:30:41,105 --> 00:30:43,573
-- Your ponche.
-- Thank you.

420
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:49,173
Best I go, I will look a little ponche

421
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:51,812
-- Yes, I also have my own, will.

422
00:30:58,289 --> 00:31:00,314
You know that you can take
A place with real music.

423
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:04,626
-- I will not Henry.
-- We will bring you back.

424
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:07,621
Who would be my company?

425
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:11,525
You come back before
That the other is give account.

426
00:31:17,342 --> 00:31:18,741
You are afraid?

427
00:31:29,687 --> 00:31:32,451
Who is the man, is with fear?

428
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:41,190
Mr. Tolson.

429
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:05,237
And it is why the lieutenant
Want the organized.

430
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:07,036
To do things well.

431
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:10,806
Yes, but trairemos you.

432
00:34:11,015 --> 00:34:12,209
Also the organise.

433
00:34:12,517 --> 00:34:14,382
Yes, we denounce for everyone.

434
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:16,444
That is what they
Want you to believe.

435
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:17,813
The heads of farms
Want to believe that.

436
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:19,216
... Going to war, but will not.

437
00:34:19,457 --> 00:34:21,823
Are idiots but are
Intelligent men of business

438
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,755
And because we are
Organized, summer.

439
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:25,461
Until the weapons can not stop us.

440
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:27,664
-- In stopped.
-- Why speaks it.

441
00:34:28,533 --> 00:34:30,865
About how we organize
According to the color.

442
00:34:31,769 --> 00:34:35,227
-- That was in 1919, friend.
-- Yes, but will fall, friend

443
00:34:35,673 --> 00:34:37,368
We feel that.

444
00:34:37,975 --> 00:34:41,138
But these men were
Alone, it is I am saying.

445
00:34:41,546 --> 00:34:42,911
We are in 1935.

446
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,648
We the National Board of Employment.

447
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:49,081
-- We AFBL.
-- We have nothing, no shit.

448
00:35:01,299 --> 00:35:02,789
They are coming, are coming.

449
00:35:03,034 --> 00:35:05,525
Apaguem the lights, hide themselves all.

450
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:38,052
Come on.

451
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:44,733
What are doing here?

452
00:36:45,336 --> 00:36:49,033
I was walking on his
Home and saw you dressed well.

453
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:52,138
Vetido I like them, believe that
I would escutariam if a house?

454
00:36:53,678 --> 00:36:56,238
Me listening, I listen?

455
00:36:57,181 --> 00:37:00,048
You can not tell anyone what he saw.

456
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:01,612
Neither my wife knows nothing of the sort.

457
00:37:01,919 --> 00:37:03,079
Do not say anything to anyone.

458
00:37:03,988 --> 00:37:06,422
Promise by Sacred
Bible that not right anything.

459
00:37:50,234 --> 00:37:54,034
Junior, will only be stopped there?

460
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:57,366
No sir.

461
00:38:07,685 --> 00:38:08,777
I have come late.

462
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:13,215
Sit, are one of the morning.

463
00:38:14,892 --> 00:38:16,587
You would have sought where wanted.

464
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:19,889
Fuia the house of the Lord
Tolson after the dance.

465
00:38:21,832 --> 00:38:25,598
I thought I would do this,
Why I was there.

466
00:38:27,104 --> 00:38:31,803
I talked to him a woman, said
Tolson had left and that you were not there.

467
00:38:33,611 --> 00:38:38,310
Once you give another
Opportunity, which was?

468
00:38:40,017 --> 00:38:42,144
-- I can not tell you.
-- Why God.

469
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,817
We were worried about you.

470
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:48,156
Junior was where?

471
00:38:51,128 --> 00:38:53,119
-- I can not tell you sir.
-- Why not?

472
00:38:53,464 --> 00:38:56,126
-- I do not know.
-- Do not know?

473
00:38:58,035 --> 00:39:00,026
This is not an acceptable response.

474
00:39:01,972 --> 00:39:04,372
-- Junior.
-- The silence is not an option.

475
00:39:06,777 --> 00:39:09,712
-- Were you drinking?
-- Wanted.

476
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:11,470
Why should be drinking
To come to my house,

477
00:39:11,716 --> 00:39:14,981
... For not wanting to say where
Were until 1 am.

478
00:39:15,786 --> 00:39:18,084
-- Let's dear, what's wrong?
-- No problem.

479
00:39:18,289 --> 00:39:20,280
Something happened,
Something is amiss.

480
00:39:21,492 --> 00:39:23,323
It was with that
Girl, was with her?

481
00:39:23,494 --> 00:39:24,688
No.

482
00:39:24,895 --> 00:39:27,887
Why has 14 years, has
For a long time after that.

483
00:39:28,299 --> 00:39:29,493
There was with Samantha.

484
00:39:32,803 --> 00:39:33,997
So where was?

485
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:40,305
Where was dear?

486
00:39:41,512 --> 00:39:44,208
Not whether we say, ok.

487
00:39:45,416 --> 00:39:46,713
But no will of this house.

488
00:39:47,118 --> 00:39:48,915
-- What to say?
-- What will not.

489
00:39:49,353 --> 00:39:51,253
There will until they tell me the truth.

490
00:39:52,456 --> 00:39:54,822
-- And school?
-- Do not question what I say.

491
00:39:55,159 --> 00:39:56,854
-- Mamãe in school?
-- Do not raise your voice.

492
00:39:57,128 --> 00:39:58,117
I am not raising the voice.

493
00:39:58,429 --> 00:39:59,919
It will raise the voice in my house?

494
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:01,721
I am not raising the voice.

495
00:40:02,032 --> 00:40:03,727
In case has work pra make money?

496
00:40:03,934 --> 00:40:06,732
-- I am not talking about high.
-- Only ask excuses.

497
00:40:07,037 --> 00:40:09,062
I did not say anything to that
Have to excuse me.

498
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,465
As apologized to
The man of pork?

499
00:40:11,976 --> 00:40:13,341
Who said?

500
00:40:20,951 --> 00:40:22,145
Go get your room.

501
00:40:38,569 --> 00:40:39,661
It will not be weak with him.

502
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:42,398
I know.

503
00:40:44,909 --> 00:40:46,809
I can not allow
My son is a corrupt.

504
00:40:48,879 --> 00:40:52,406
You are right, we only get bed.

505
00:40:54,185 --> 00:40:56,710
I levarei the school the morning.

506
00:40:57,321 --> 00:40:58,982
-- Okay?
-- Okay.

507
00:41:12,837 --> 00:41:15,271
I will be honest with you, I am not well.

508
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:17,931
I am not anything well this morning.

509
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:19,632
Sorry sir.

510
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:22,044
But it seems you well, right?

511
00:41:22,379 --> 00:41:23,846
Yes sir, seems very well.

512
00:41:24,782 --> 00:41:27,945
We will have some kind of white
North who come to our town.

513
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:30,950
They are bringing problems between
Men of color and whites.

514
00:41:32,089 --> 00:41:33,750
They say that we
Make a union.

515
00:41:34,458 --> 00:41:36,790
All workers,
Those of color and whites.

516
00:41:37,761 --> 00:41:40,889
Needing a trade union?
Who believes that?

517
00:41:41,765 --> 00:41:43,756
I do not know you, I do not know much of this.

518
00:41:45,402 --> 00:41:48,963
Esas is a bad idea,
Believe it is an extremely bad.

519
00:41:49,874 --> 00:41:50,966
Yes, sir.

520
00:41:51,375 --> 00:41:54,401
They say that there was a meeting
Secretly near the lake.

521
00:41:55,279 --> 00:41:56,906
Do you know anything about that?

522
00:41:57,214 --> 00:41:58,181
No sir.

523
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:00,241
Do not know?

524
00:42:01,752 --> 00:42:03,652
-- Samuel?
-- No sir.

525
00:42:03,921 --> 00:42:04,819
-- Do not know?
-- No sir.

526
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:06,819
-- Jura?
-- Yes, sir, interest.

527
00:42:10,928 --> 00:42:12,259
Okay then.

528
00:42:15,466 --> 00:42:16,763
The see later.

529
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:19,628
Our first debate is,

530
00:42:19,937 --> 00:42:23,338
.... Within a week.

531
00:42:24,742 --> 00:42:26,437
-- In a week?
-- That same.

532
00:42:26,744 --> 00:42:28,644
I thought the preview was first.

533
00:42:28,846 --> 00:42:30,643
Preview is the highest, so I thought
That we need a warming.

534
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:32,746
With the best black university in the USA?

535
00:42:33,651 --> 00:42:36,347
That same sr. Burgess,
Is with fear?

536
00:42:36,654 --> 00:42:37,848
Yes sir.

537
00:42:38,656 --> 00:42:41,056
A week is not enough time
Write to the arguments.

538
00:42:41,659 --> 00:42:43,251
You will
Research, I should write.

539
00:42:44,161 --> 00:42:46,994
Wait, you, so you write?

540
00:42:47,264 --> 00:42:48,094
And you tell the sr. Lowe.

541
00:42:48,299 --> 00:42:49,698
What devils seem, a postman?

542
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:52,164
The devil will be
I ask again.

543
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:55,270
In theory seems a student.

544
00:42:55,773 --> 00:42:57,570
So is saying
I am not capable?

545
00:42:57,775 --> 00:43:00,505
There is no question of ability
But of experience.

546
00:43:00,711 --> 00:43:02,702
-- How can you?
-- So I write.

547
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:06,216
Thus has always been,
Will be well.

548
00:43:07,451 --> 00:43:08,611
Some other question?

549
00:43:11,722 --> 00:43:12,620
One week.

550
00:43:15,826 --> 00:43:18,056
Bring them to our first
Student yes.

551
00:43:19,063 --> 00:43:21,054
The University of Callqueen.

552
00:43:21,632 --> 00:43:23,463
Oquery Hobert.

553
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:34,639
The assistance of
Unemployed should acarba.

554
00:43:35,646 --> 00:43:37,739
When the depression finish.

555
00:43:38,148 --> 00:43:39,740
If it is going to end.

556
00:43:40,184 --> 00:43:43,449
I have traveled in atrá
History until 1536.

557
00:43:43,654 --> 00:43:45,747
When the first laws of
England were written.

558
00:43:46,156 --> 00:43:49,057
In these days to assistance
As a call.

559
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,551
They were paid through
Voluntary donations.

560
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:54,454
But over time,

561
00:43:54,898 --> 00:43:56,866
... The British divided
The systems of maintenance.

562
00:43:57,267 --> 00:43:59,167
The first law of unemployment.

563
00:43:59,603 --> 00:44:02,003
If paid with donations not voluntary.

564
00:44:02,406 --> 00:44:04,704
More commonly known as taxes.

565
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:08,201
This system was a disaster.

566
00:44:08,512 --> 00:44:10,844
Not enough to give
A man a job.

567
00:44:11,248 --> 00:44:13,910
But to do so would
That give you an economic life.

568
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:16,650
Not levy taxes until they died.

569
00:44:22,726 --> 00:44:24,523
When capitalism was young.

570
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:26,762
The concept puritano of duty was,

571
00:44:27,731 --> 00:44:29,926
... That no one who works not comeria.

572
00:44:30,634 --> 00:44:33,467
And this was happening when
More work than men.

573
00:44:33,937 --> 00:44:35,234
But those days passed.

574
00:44:35,572 --> 00:44:39,064
Now those who want to
Work are unemployed,

575
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:40,742
So they should not eat?

576
00:44:40,944 --> 00:44:42,241
Because there is no work?

577
00:44:42,446 --> 00:44:44,437
Today, we need
Another concept of duty.

578
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:47,150
The right of an individual
Of losing the sociedae,

579
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:49,285
... Both as a society.

580
00:44:53,257 --> 00:44:55,589
Applaud to anything
That seems a solution.

581
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:58,854
60 million dollars
The month for assistance.

582
00:44:59,963 --> 00:45:02,625
Pagaria with it if it
Eliminated the vagabonds of the streets.

583
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:06,997
One seventh of the population of this
Live country's welfare.

584
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:09,900
Would be good with it
End the misery.

585
00:45:10,307 --> 00:45:12,798
A nation so desperate with this,

586
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:14,500
... Is a danger to itself.

587
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:23,118
As a general Roman brought
Peace provinces rebels.

588
00:45:24,922 --> 00:45:26,719
Killing for all its citizens.

589
00:45:27,524 --> 00:45:29,048
Until his companions
Romans were in shock.

590
00:45:29,326 --> 00:45:32,727
One described ...

591
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:36,322
What that create siginifica
Desolation and call it peace.

592
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:42,331
And with all the facts and data,
Of Callqueen also created desolation.

593
00:45:42,673 --> 00:45:44,038
And call for peace.

594
00:45:44,341 --> 00:45:47,742
They want that desempregadosmorram
So that the economy could live.

595
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:08,189
A bright young man
Us once asked,

596
00:46:08,398 --> 00:46:10,525
... Argued that its position
On social assistance.

597
00:46:12,503 --> 00:46:14,528
She named the most powerful source

598
00:46:15,506 --> 00:46:18,600
The look in the eyes of a mother
When they can not feed their children.

599
00:46:23,413 --> 00:46:25,142
They can look at the famine
In the eyes of a child?

600
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:28,509
See the blood on your feet by walking
Descalço in the fields of cotton?

601
00:46:29,419 --> 00:46:31,649
Perguntarem her sister
With pain in the belly of hunger,

602
00:46:31,922 --> 00:46:33,617
... It is with ethics
The work of his father?

603
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:46,629
He is good.

604
00:47:06,023 --> 00:47:08,184
All that matters is that
The big fish and small,

605
00:47:08,392 --> 00:47:10,883
... The color of the fish does not see.

606
00:47:12,229 --> 00:47:13,821
GANHADOS 2. LOST 0.

607
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:18,491
We should do something every
Time a victim is black.

608
00:47:19,203 --> 00:47:20,693
The federal government
Should not intervene?

609
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:27,741
GANHADOS 3. LOST 0.

610
00:47:58,041 --> 00:47:59,736
And the winner is ...

611
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:04,777
The University of Wiley.

612
00:48:11,021 --> 00:48:13,080
GANHADOS 9. LOST 0.

613

DEBATEDORES THE UNIVERSITY OF WILEY
NEW CONFERENCE CAMPEÕES

615
00:48:43,153 --> 00:48:45,314
So is captain, I have the leader.

616
00:48:48,825 --> 00:48:50,725
Okay, it is what you want.

617
00:48:52,529 --> 00:48:54,827
They will, goodbye.

618
00:48:57,034 --> 00:48:59,332
-- Shit.
-- Who was?

619
00:49:00,370 --> 00:49:01,701
Captain Wayne Right.

620
00:49:02,105 --> 00:49:03,402
The captain of police of Texas?

621
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:10,312
He wants to wait
And not get the leader,

622
00:49:10,681 --> 00:49:12,376
... Until he and his boys arrive.

623
00:49:12,883 --> 00:49:14,908
Shit, for sure whether
Leave in the newspaper.

624
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:18,584
So we do the whole
Work and they have the glory.

625
00:49:22,392 --> 00:49:24,087
Once the world works.

626
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:28,495
I am sure Samuel?

627
00:49:35,205 --> 00:49:36,331
I get something announce, sorry.

628
00:49:38,709 --> 00:49:40,939
Recently I us.

629
00:49:41,845 --> 00:49:45,110
Mandamos some letters
Some universities.

630
00:49:46,450 --> 00:49:48,111
Counting of us,
Of our team,

631
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:49,512
... Do we do.

632
00:49:51,021 --> 00:49:53,216
Us and they responded.

633
00:49:55,025 --> 00:49:57,016
The University of
City of Oklahoma.

634
00:49:57,327 --> 00:49:59,318
-- Not?
-- Yes, Anglo-Saxons.

635
00:50:00,464 --> 00:50:02,625
We will be the first university
U.S. black,

636
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:04,323
... And one of the first
University in America,

637
00:50:04,634 --> 00:50:06,124
... To have a debate in
A university white.

638
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:07,530
That's nice.

639
00:50:07,771 --> 00:50:09,329
The University of Oklahoma.

640
00:50:09,539 --> 00:50:12,030
Not the University of Oklahoma
But to the city of Oklahoma.

641
00:50:12,442 --> 00:50:14,774
The debate will be in a
Camp in the north.

642
00:50:15,545 --> 00:50:17,240
Because a camp?

643
00:50:17,481 --> 00:50:20,939
Why should the times
Take things little by little.

644
00:50:21,251 --> 00:50:24,379
You are not saying that
Can enter the university?

645
00:50:24,588 --> 00:50:26,783
No, I say we should
Go slowly.

646
00:50:27,057 --> 00:50:29,457
-- This is a great opportunity.
-- Thank you.

647
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:33,491
The opportunity to merge
Migalha one of your plate.

648
00:50:37,901 --> 00:50:39,061
What?

649
00:50:40,203 --> 00:50:41,568
I believe that Lowe is afraid.

650
00:50:42,372 --> 00:50:44,169
James Who?

651
00:50:44,808 --> 00:50:46,503
I believe that is afraid of
Discuss with whites

652
00:50:46,676 --> 00:50:47,870
-- Anglo-Saxons.
-- Anglo-Saxons.

653
00:50:48,111 --> 00:50:50,170
-- Thank you.
-- Me leave discuss.

654
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:54,075
I debaterei with
Anglo-Saxons wherever.

655
00:50:54,785 --> 00:50:56,309
In a dark alley without light.

656
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:59,020
With a Candelabrum and people
In pursuing with weapons.

657
00:50:59,222 --> 00:51:01,247
I debateria with
Anglo-Saxons wherever.

658
00:51:01,858 --> 00:51:03,826
-- I am not afraid.
-- I do.

659
00:51:09,132 --> 00:51:10,861
Mr. Tolson when I came here today.

660
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:13,229
I saw men of
Sherife watching your house.

661
00:51:14,471 --> 00:51:16,029
What is hovendo?

662
00:51:20,777 --> 00:51:22,244
Maybe you should
Ask sherife.

663
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:24,338
There are many rumours about what it does.

664
00:51:25,682 --> 00:51:27,877
My father called the
Dean last week.

665
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:30,076
And asked if there was a
Communist at the University Methodist.

666
00:51:30,287 --> 00:51:34,451
My policy is my problem and promise
That does not put at risk the team.

667
00:51:34,691 --> 00:51:36,056
But if you are in danger.

668
00:51:37,194 --> 00:51:39,458
I came to learn University
Not that I investigate.

669
00:51:39,696 --> 00:51:41,493
-- Te understand.
-- I do not want drag.

670
00:51:41,965 --> 00:51:43,193
Yes my father ...

671
00:51:45,402 --> 00:51:46,596
Souber.

672
00:51:48,572 --> 00:51:51,700
Mr. Tolson me just say
It is not communism is not ...

673
00:51:52,075 --> 00:51:53,269
If not what?

674
00:51:57,681 --> 00:51:59,080
If not what?

675
00:51:59,416 --> 00:52:00,815
My father said that I should leave him.

676
00:52:01,051 --> 00:52:02,712
-- Nobody wants that.
-- Me says.

677
00:52:05,822 --> 00:52:09,724
As I said, my policy is my problem.

678
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:14,328
Then I leave it.

679
00:52:25,041 --> 00:52:28,033
Mrs. Tolson, thanks for dinner.

680
00:52:29,646 --> 00:52:31,443
De nada.

681
00:52:33,850 --> 00:52:35,283
Good luck in Oklahoma.

682
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:39,478
I know that win.

683
00:52:56,907 --> 00:52:58,670
If someone wants more
Let me, I entenderei.

684
00:53:45,655 --> 00:53:47,850
The black ...

685
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,651
... Should be admitted.

686
00:53:53,263 --> 00:53:55,094
We can hear you.

687
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,199
I say,

688
00:53:59,669 --> 00:54:03,901
Black people should be admitted,

689
00:54:04,207 --> 00:54:06,198
... At the state university.

690
00:54:07,844 --> 00:54:10,108
My companion and I taste it,

691
00:54:10,814 --> 00:54:13,408
... Blocking the admission of blacks,

692
00:54:13,617 --> 00:54:16,745
... At the University of the State
Is not only wrong.

693
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:19,317
It is absurd.

694
00:54:20,323 --> 00:54:25,522
People of color are not
Only the color on the cloth American.

695
00:54:26,263 --> 00:54:29,130
They are the line that
Keeps everything together.

696
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:32,731
Considering the records
Legal and historical.

697
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:36,535
May 13, 1865,
Craker sergeant, a black.

698
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:39,538
It is the last soldier who
Died in the Civil War.

699
00:54:40,377 --> 00:54:42,368
In 1918 the first
American soldiers,

700
00:54:42,646 --> 00:54:44,273
Condecorados by ...
Prowess in France.

701
00:54:44,648 --> 00:54:48,243
Are blacks Henry
Johnson and Nito Robins.

702
00:54:48,585 --> 00:54:53,079
1920, The New York Times
Announces that the "n" of black,

703
00:54:53,456 --> 00:54:55,890
... Is to write capital
From there on.

704
00:54:56,192 --> 00:54:59,355
Leaving the south for them, but where
Are not prepared for this.

705
00:55:00,397 --> 00:55:02,524
It would cause nothing but racial hatred.

706
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:08,837
The doctor WE Devoid, perhaps
The most eminent black America.

707
00:55:09,105 --> 00:55:10,402
He said,

708
00:55:11,207 --> 00:55:13,300
... It is a loss
Silly of money.

709
00:55:13,610 --> 00:55:14,941
Time and temperament,

710
00:55:15,512 --> 00:55:17,309
... Deal with what the majority does,

711
00:55:18,548 --> 00:55:20,311
... Which determined
That never would.

712
00:55:21,251 --> 00:55:23,811
My opponent chose
Conveniently ignore,

713
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:28,814
... That W. E. Devoid is
The first black receberu a PhD,

714
00:55:29,125 --> 00:55:31,320
... In a university
White, imagine.

715
00:55:31,728 --> 00:55:33,923
The doctor said that it is impossible,

716
00:55:35,432 --> 00:55:39,129
... Impossible for a black
Receive a proper education,

717
00:55:39,369 --> 00:55:41,234
... In a white university.

718
00:55:41,538 --> 00:55:43,233
Most black eminiente
University of America,

719
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:45,440
... Is the product of a
Education white.

720
00:55:46,142 --> 00:55:49,339
Devoi knows well the resistance
The white man to change.

721
00:55:50,447 --> 00:55:52,938
But that is no reason to keep any
The black out of any university.

722
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:56,341
If someone forçasse the south to something
For which is not prepared.

723
00:55:56,553 --> 00:55:59,044
Then, however, be wrong
And srta. Booke would cook

724
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:06,185
Admit it is true.

725
00:56:07,097 --> 00:56:09,895
Many white are infected
With the disease of racial hatred.

726
00:56:11,701 --> 00:56:15,728
And the racism would be impossible
For a negro be happy,

727
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:17,939
... In a southern university today.

728
00:56:18,641 --> 00:56:20,040
And if someone is unhappy,

729
00:56:20,910 --> 00:56:24,346
... It is impossible to see how they can
Receive a proper education.

730
00:56:26,149 --> 00:56:29,812
If, come the moment where
Blacks and whites are the same school.

731
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:32,049
And share the same classes.

732
00:56:34,758 --> 00:56:36,817
But unfortunately that day is not today.

733
00:56:37,427 --> 00:56:40,919
While the schools are segregated.

734
00:56:41,631 --> 00:56:44,725
The black one rebeberão
Education which are both,

735
00:56:44,968 --> 00:56:46,833
... Separate and unequal.

736
00:56:47,370 --> 00:56:49,235
By thinking of Oklahoma.

737
00:56:49,539 --> 00:56:52,940
The state is spending 5 times more,

738
00:56:53,176 --> 00:56:54,837
... In the education of a child white.

739
00:56:55,145 --> 00:56:57,170
What in the education of a black.

740
00:56:57,781 --> 00:57:00,045
This means better
Books for that child.

741
00:57:00,283 --> 00:57:02,615
I say that this is a lástima.

742
00:57:02,919 --> 00:57:05,979
But my opponent said
That today is not that day,

743
00:57:07,290 --> 00:57:09,622
... So that blacks and whites
Go the same university.

744
00:57:10,026 --> 00:57:12,187
Share the same premises.

745
00:57:12,395 --> 00:57:14,329
Walking in the same classes.

746
00:57:14,597 --> 00:57:17,794
Could you tell me when
Is that that day will come?

747
00:57:18,034 --> 00:57:19,092
On tomorrow?

748
00:57:19,402 --> 00:57:21,597
On this week that
Come, in one hundred years,

749
00:57:21,905 --> 00:57:22,997
... Never?

750
00:57:23,306 --> 00:57:27,709
There is no time for justice. The time
For freedom and equality,

751
00:57:28,011 --> 00:57:31,344
... Is always, always, always now!

752
00:57:48,832 --> 00:57:50,629
Thank you.

753
00:58:01,077 --> 00:58:02,772
What is this?

754
00:58:03,112 --> 00:58:05,080
Te said it is wine,
Care with heart.

755
00:58:06,015 --> 00:58:07,676
-- If said.
-- It's good.

756
00:58:09,686 --> 00:58:11,483
Replace if needed.

757
00:58:19,095 --> 00:58:20,722
And my arms were the words.

758
00:58:21,097 --> 00:58:23,930
It would not have to do anything, anything, you will see ...

759
00:58:25,635 --> 00:58:27,330
Me find out in 5 minutes.

760
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:29,703
Okay.

761
00:58:43,953 --> 00:58:45,318
Nobody knows that better than you.

762
00:58:46,823 --> 00:58:48,723
-- How is Pearl?
-- Pearl?

763
00:58:49,025 --> 00:58:51,016
What vom see you, and your husband?

764
00:58:51,327 --> 00:58:52,419
You are in the studio.

765
00:59:06,576 --> 00:59:09,807
-- Dr. Farmer.
-- Congratulations Melvin.

766
00:59:10,179 --> 00:59:11,976
-- Thanks.
-- In put on the map.

767
00:59:12,181 --> 00:59:15,014
Your child has done a great job,
His research is impeccable.

768
00:59:15,785 --> 00:59:17,878
This is good, good.

769
00:59:19,822 --> 00:59:24,191
There are people of the city that are not
Happy with their other activities.

770
00:59:25,795 --> 00:59:27,126
The call radical.

771
00:59:28,097 --> 00:59:30,122
I surpeenderia
That one day discovered,

772
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:33,300
... And I said that
You hung in a tree.

773
00:59:33,536 --> 00:59:34,696
Would that get me before.

774
00:59:35,705 --> 00:59:37,935
Melvim This is serious, very serious.

775
00:59:38,207 --> 00:59:40,402
A hungry black steals
A chicken and will get prison.

776
00:59:41,744 --> 00:59:44,736
A rich merchant, steals the
Farm and goes to the congress.

777
00:59:45,048 --> 00:59:45,946
I believe that this is wrong.

778
00:59:46,149 --> 00:59:48,515
If that makes me radical, a
Socialist, a communist ...

779
00:59:49,852 --> 00:59:51,342
-- Jesus was radical.
-- Be careful.

780
00:59:51,621 --> 00:59:53,316
-- Yes, it was, it was radical.
-- Careful, careful.

781
00:59:53,656 --> 00:59:56,750
Many institutions are in flood
People who badly interpreted Jesus.

782
00:59:57,060 --> 00:59:59,119
Now it is compared with Jesus Christ?

783
00:59:59,529 --> 01:00:02,157
If compares with Jesus? You know
What the words are.

784
01:00:02,632 --> 01:00:04,031
-- Come on.
-- Amen

785
01:00:04,334 --> 01:00:05,665
I do not want me confused.

786
01:00:05,935 --> 01:00:07,334
I am not confusing, I believe.

787
01:00:08,638 --> 01:00:10,765
Do not you think.

788
01:00:12,141 --> 01:00:14,575
Only worries me their methods.

789
01:00:16,779 --> 01:00:18,041
What methods?

790
01:00:19,048 --> 01:00:21,448
James was there tonight, huh?

791
01:00:22,752 --> 01:00:24,276
It was not me.

792
01:00:24,787 --> 01:00:26,584
-- Is the surrounding it?
-- Of course not.

793
01:00:26,856 --> 01:00:29,051
I will do everything possible
Make it out of this.

794
01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:31,657
Deixá it? He wants to be that?
Me says it wants?

795
01:00:31,894 --> 01:00:34,454
No, not whether, perhaps
Should discuss this with him.

796
01:00:35,365 --> 01:00:38,163
I am speaking with you and
I do not believe that is honeto.

797
01:00:38,368 --> 01:00:40,063
I am being honest ...

798
01:00:40,269 --> 01:00:41,759
I think that was there with him tonight.

799
01:00:42,005 --> 01:00:44,166
-- He was not me.
-- He is a boy of 14 years.

800
01:00:44,307 --> 01:00:45,296
I understand.

801
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:47,568
And I will do whatever it takes to
Protect you, understand?

802
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:49,175
Someone has headquarters?

803
01:00:51,214 --> 01:00:53,182
-- Thanks.
-- From nothing.

804
01:00:56,386 --> 01:00:58,684
-- This is a beautiful party.
-- Thank you.

805
01:00:59,889 --> 01:01:01,322
I think it is time to cut the cake.

806
01:01:01,524 --> 01:01:02,957
-- Please.
-- Te ajudarei.

807
01:01:11,334 --> 01:01:13,131
It is not time to talk about it.

808
01:01:14,037 --> 01:01:15,334
-- Congratulations.
-- Thanks.

809
01:01:40,263 --> 01:01:41,753
This is so beautiful.

810
01:01:44,167 --> 01:01:48,069
Yes, I was born here, near the lake.

811
01:01:49,872 --> 01:01:51,772
I come here since he was a boy.

812
01:01:53,276 --> 01:01:55,005
His parents live here?

813
01:01:55,812 --> 01:01:58,076
No, they already were.

814
01:01:59,115 --> 01:02:00,343
My grandparents created me.

815
01:02:01,117 --> 01:02:05,713
And my grandfather spent their lives building
All this, of course bounty.

816
01:02:06,422 --> 01:02:07,946
He was a slave?

817
01:02:09,425 --> 01:02:11,325
My grandmother always me
Said that if we do not include well.

818
01:02:11,527 --> 01:02:13,859
The Confederates would
And I would take.

819
01:02:23,473 --> 01:02:24,371
What?

820
01:02:25,241 --> 01:02:27,675
Never had seen his side before.

821
01:02:28,444 --> 01:02:29,638
What next?

822
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:33,242
It seems so calm, peace.

823
01:02:35,051 --> 01:02:38,248
This happens, I am happy here.

824
01:02:41,657 --> 01:02:42,954
It's funny.

825
01:02:57,273 --> 01:03:00,299
Part of me wants
Stay in the lake.

826
01:03:01,844 --> 01:03:05,541
Reading books all day,
Fishing when you have hunger.

827
01:03:07,817 --> 01:03:10,342
And the other part wants to go
To all places and see everything.

828
01:03:10,820 --> 01:03:13,414
Want to go to New Orleans,
In New York, Chicago,

829
01:03:13,856 --> 01:03:16,051
... San Francisco.

830
01:03:18,961 --> 01:03:22,829
Take the road.

831
01:03:25,067 --> 01:03:27,035
And disappear.

832
01:03:30,573 --> 01:03:32,871
Maybe I can take you.

833
01:05:19,815 --> 01:05:21,180
-- Stir Up
-- Which was?

834
01:05:21,217 --> 01:05:22,912
The band is outside.

835
01:05:22,952 --> 01:05:26,353
What? By Allah. He said that
Anyone see today.

836
01:05:26,422 --> 01:05:27,912
Usually nobody comes.

837
01:05:27,957 --> 01:05:29,948
Wait, wait.

838
01:05:34,030 --> 01:05:35,224
Vista itself

839
01:05:35,264 --> 01:05:36,595
What is there?

840
01:05:36,632 --> 01:05:39,533
We will seek Mr. Tolson and
Samantha and return to university.

841
01:05:41,237 --> 01:05:42,499
We will view themselves.

842
01:05:42,538 --> 01:05:45,439
Go and tell Tolson, I
With me later.

843
01:05:46,976 --> 01:05:50,241
Let Lowe, knows that
We will grow ...

844
01:06:01,991 --> 01:06:04,619
It seems that it will join later.

845
01:06:17,206 --> 01:06:19,003
It will join later.

846
01:06:20,142 --> 01:06:22,508
Are some things get done.

847
01:06:40,229 --> 01:06:43,721
Good news, good
News, good news ...

848
01:06:44,567 --> 01:06:47,263
My phone tapped until
No more power.

849
01:06:47,336 --> 01:06:49,497
The University of Michigan wants
Discuss with us.

850
01:06:49,538 --> 01:06:52,974
This goes to you, to Georgia,
Where is sr. Lowe?

851
01:06:53,042 --> 01:06:54,771
Once again the debate?

852
01:06:54,844 --> 01:06:57,711
Faster than imagined
James, much faster.

853
01:06:57,747 --> 01:06:58,873
When?

854
01:06:58,948 --> 01:06:59,972
When it is ready.

855
01:07:00,049 --> 01:07:01,277
I am ready now.

856
01:07:01,317 --> 01:07:03,683
Mr. Tolson, I do not believe that James ...

857
01:07:06,589 --> 01:07:08,250
What is there?

858
01:07:08,290 --> 01:07:10,485
Maybe you tired of this.

859
01:07:10,526 --> 01:07:11,652
What?

860
01:07:11,694 --> 01:07:13,594
From see other people debating.

861
01:07:13,629 --> 01:07:15,893
When I my opportunity Tuesday?

862
01:07:15,931 --> 01:07:17,990
It is our best researcher James.

863
01:07:18,034 --> 01:07:19,899
There could do nothing without you.

864
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:22,495
I know you can do it without me.

865
01:07:26,909 --> 01:07:28,399
Sorry.

866
01:07:31,313 --> 01:07:32,302
-- James.
-- What?

867
01:07:32,348 --> 01:07:34,509
James, wait.

868
01:07:35,718 --> 01:07:38,118
It was very unpleasant what I said.

869
01:07:42,024 --> 01:07:43,548
I do not want to lose your friendship ...

870
01:07:43,626 --> 01:07:46,459
How can you lose
Something that has never?

871
01:07:47,129 --> 01:07:49,222
It has never been my friend?

872
01:07:49,265 --> 01:07:51,665
Perhaps not only want to be your friend.

873
01:07:51,734 --> 01:07:54,066
Maybe I machuque be your friend.

874
01:08:09,985 --> 01:08:11,384
-- Legend not translated --

875
01:08:15,491 --> 01:08:17,220
Mr. Tolson.

876
01:08:22,798 --> 01:08:23,856
Where is he?

877
01:08:23,899 --> 01:08:25,366
-- Calma Lowe.
-- You saw it?

878
01:08:25,401 --> 01:08:26,800
We left.

879
01:08:26,836 --> 01:08:28,736
-- They did something to you?
-- No, we are fine.

880
01:08:28,804 --> 01:08:30,271
Journal.

881
01:08:30,306 --> 01:08:31,933
I am Dr. James Farmer.

882
01:08:32,007 --> 01:08:34,100
This is William Taylor,
The lawyer sr. Tolson.

883
01:08:34,143 --> 01:08:36,134
-- And this is his wife, Ruth
-- Hi

884
01:08:36,212 --> 01:08:38,043
I would like to see my client, please.

885
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:39,604
William.

886
01:08:39,648 --> 01:08:41,673
Journal Dozier, Dr. James Farmer,
This is William ...

887
01:08:41,717 --> 01:08:43,014
William, as it is?

888
01:08:43,052 --> 01:08:46,044
-- Well, sr. And you?
-- Not so bad, not so bad.

889
01:08:46,088 --> 01:08:49,751
Look as time passes, knew
William when I was a boy

890
01:08:49,825 --> 01:08:52,293
Can I see my client
Now, officer?

891
01:08:52,328 --> 01:08:54,057
His client?

892
01:08:54,096 --> 01:08:58,032
The reality of the facts, it
That his client is busy.

893
01:08:58,067 --> 01:08:59,557
Busy, doing what?

894
01:08:59,602 --> 01:09:01,968
Journal, official.

895
01:09:03,973 --> 01:09:05,463
We have a problem ...

896
01:09:06,008 --> 01:09:08,670
-- Send the kids get out there.
-- According.

897
01:09:09,879 --> 01:09:13,315
Let it go, let it go ...

898
01:09:27,396 --> 01:09:29,421
-- Are you?
-- OK.

899
01:09:29,999 --> 01:09:33,696
Look, this is what happens to a
When people give a lot wing.

900
01:09:34,136 --> 01:09:35,569
They get the problems.

901
01:09:35,604 --> 01:09:38,004
The people want to turn away for nothing.

902
01:09:38,073 --> 01:09:41,008
Many may quit
Machucados if this continues.

903
01:09:42,411 --> 01:09:45,073
Journal, it is clear
That is not evidence,

904
01:09:45,114 --> 01:09:46,843
To secure sr Tolson.

905
01:09:46,916 --> 01:09:48,850
I suggest that we let it go.

906
01:09:48,918 --> 01:09:51,250
You suggest? Who hell are you?

907
01:09:53,022 --> 01:09:54,717
Some months,

908
01:09:54,757 --> 01:09:57,419
There was a beating in a bar in the city.

909
01:09:58,327 --> 01:10:02,229
It was a peaceful and dear
Of our citizens,

910
01:10:02,264 --> 01:10:06,530
That was brutally attacked by a
Gangue of violent vigilant.

911
01:10:06,569 --> 01:10:10,130
You have been witness, because there was.

912
01:10:10,873 --> 01:10:14,138
If you allow cause
Sherife this anger,

913
01:10:14,176 --> 01:10:17,339
It is you who is
Breaking the law. Not them.

914
01:10:18,614 --> 01:10:20,946
You are threatening me?

915
01:10:20,983 --> 01:10:22,541
No, sir.

916
01:10:22,585 --> 01:10:23,882
I would not make it.

917
01:10:23,953 --> 01:10:26,979
But I can not speak for
That people who are outside.

918
01:10:28,791 --> 01:10:32,727
When the law is not
Just, not flame law.

919
01:10:32,761 --> 01:10:34,888
What does that mean?

920
01:10:34,964 --> 01:10:36,955
A mass of angry citizens.

921
01:10:36,999 --> 01:10:39,991
Whites and blacks.

922
01:10:40,069 --> 01:10:42,333
Brigando as in war.

923
01:10:42,371 --> 01:10:46,068
That's what you want as
Sherife this county?

924
01:10:48,644 --> 01:10:51,078
Leaving that Tolson go get home.

925
01:10:51,580 --> 01:10:55,482
I believe that all these friends
That are out there ...

926
01:10:56,785 --> 01:10:58,912
... Will also get home.

927
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:27,776
-- This application costs 25 US dollars.
-- What?

928
01:11:28,150 --> 01:11:30,243
I believe that money should qu eme.

929
01:12:29,745 --> 01:12:31,110
Building up sr. Farmer.

930
01:12:32,881 --> 01:12:34,849
Oh God ...

931
01:12:40,055 --> 01:12:42,615
The Universdidade the Methodist
South canceled.

932
01:12:42,658 --> 01:12:46,526
The University of Georgia
Appear that will do the same.

933
01:12:46,562 --> 01:12:48,189
Why?

934
01:12:49,465 --> 01:12:51,865
Always has been the black.

935
01:12:52,368 --> 01:12:54,165
They are speaking on censoring,

936
01:12:54,203 --> 01:12:56,637
The council asked me that

937
01:12:56,672 --> 01:12:59,937
Stop working with
Leaders, and in another way,

938
01:12:59,975 --> 01:13:02,273
I say that this is not my fight.

939
01:13:02,311 --> 01:13:04,643
So ...

940
01:13:04,713 --> 01:13:06,476
... Things are evil ...

941
01:13:06,515 --> 01:13:08,142
My academic career is at risk,

942
01:13:08,217 --> 01:13:10,845
My team for debate is not pra go.

943
01:13:12,921 --> 01:13:15,082
Someone knows who was Anteu?

944
01:13:15,124 --> 01:13:19,424
Certainly, it was a giant
Of Greek mythology.

945
01:13:20,028 --> 01:13:23,828
His mother was Gaia, which was the land.

946
01:13:25,167 --> 01:13:29,160
It was invincible because the contact
With the land was stronger.

947
01:13:29,238 --> 01:13:31,638
Correct, was stronger.

948
01:13:31,673 --> 01:13:35,609
It had to defeat the
Which was strong.

949
01:13:35,644 --> 01:13:37,737
You are my students,
I am your teacher.

950
01:13:37,780 --> 01:13:40,510
I believe that this bond is sacred.

951
01:13:40,549 --> 01:13:42,449
What will I do now?

953
01:13:43,552 --> 01:13:46,885
Why the board said,
Because the sherife said?

954
01:13:46,955 --> 01:13:49,822
Why do the guards
Texas said? No!

955
01:13:49,858 --> 01:13:52,383
I am being coerced to do.

956
01:13:52,461 --> 01:13:55,157
My message you get
Does not return.

957
01:13:55,197 --> 01:13:56,596
We did not let us quit.

958
01:13:56,665 --> 01:13:57,563
Good

959
01:13:57,599 --> 01:13:59,464
What to do?

960
01:13:59,501 --> 01:14:01,093
-- What discuss with Harvard.
-- Harvard?

961
01:14:01,136 --> 01:14:04,230
The University of Harvard, they
Have the national champions.

962
01:14:04,306 --> 01:14:06,968
If the derrotarmos,
Derrotaremos the best.

963
01:14:07,009 --> 01:14:08,977
Sr.Tolson with respect.

964
01:14:09,011 --> 01:14:11,002
Harvard do not want to compete with us.

965
01:14:11,046 --> 01:14:13,173
We are a small University
From Marshall, Texas.

966
01:14:13,215 --> 01:14:14,375
I know that we Henry.

967
01:14:14,416 --> 01:14:16,247
I have read their letters,
Studied their monitors ...

968
01:14:16,318 --> 01:14:17,751
How do we get there?

969
01:14:17,820 --> 01:14:19,287
Only if contunarmos winning.

970
01:14:19,321 --> 01:14:21,915
Dr. Farmer informed me,
That the Harvard University,

971
01:14:23,025 --> 01:14:23,923
Will give a demonstration
Prior next week.

972
01:14:24,626 --> 01:14:25,422
We have nothing to lose.

973
01:14:26,328 --> 01:14:27,124
If elimanarmos Harvard ...

974
01:14:27,429 --> 01:14:29,727
... We defeated the
University best in the country.

975
01:14:29,932 --> 01:14:33,265
Assure them that this will not
Will be able to ignore that.

976
01:14:34,169 --> 01:14:35,636
Correct?

977
01:14:35,737 --> 01:14:37,034
Yes

978
01:14:46,248 --> 01:14:48,773
-- Look good, does not see this?
-- Tried throughout corner.

979
01:14:48,851 --> 01:14:52,548
-- Preview, Texas. It is the 1-27.
-- Me ensiana that meeting.

980
01:14:52,588 --> 01:14:54,556
1-27, look good.

981
01:14:54,590 --> 01:14:57,650
-- Not here.
-- Is yes, that is not found.

982
01:14:57,693 --> 01:14:59,786
He saw the 2 and 7.

983
01:14:59,862 --> 01:15:02,524
Sure, look it, is here.

984
01:15:04,099 --> 01:15:07,398
After 1-26,
Before 1-28.

985
01:15:08,437 --> 01:15:11,600
No way ... where
Gone this map?

986
01:15:54,750 --> 01:15:56,149
What are doing?

987
01:15:56,184 --> 01:15:58,084
I will fall.

988
01:15:59,154 --> 01:16:01,179
Tour pro car, close the door.

989
01:16:02,624 --> 01:16:04,592
Nobody moves.

990
01:16:06,295 --> 01:16:09,093
Abaixem is abaixem up.

991
01:16:12,701 --> 01:16:14,430
Download up too.

992
01:16:30,118 --> 01:16:31,608
It has a black in that car.

993
01:16:32,521 --> 01:16:34,614
Come on, let's pick it.

994
01:17:21,403 --> 01:17:25,601
Ok, all seats
Quiet, I will ...

995
01:17:25,641 --> 01:17:28,303
... Fetch the keys.

996
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:39,648
-- How is sra. Baker?
-- I am fine.

997
01:17:40,322 --> 01:17:40,845
-- Okay?
-- Yes

998
01:17:41,523 --> 01:17:43,320
-- Among please.
-- Thanks

999
01:17:49,031 --> 01:17:50,430
Henry.

1000
01:17:55,070 --> 01:17:56,435
Henry.

1001
01:17:57,839 --> 01:17:59,431
Henry.

1002
01:19:00,469 --> 01:19:02,494
Hi baby, how are you?

1003
01:19:05,006 --> 01:19:07,372
I was waiting for?

1004
01:19:10,679 --> 01:19:12,977
What is the problem dear? Come on.

1005
01:19:15,717 --> 01:19:17,184
Samantha.

1006
01:19:18,887 --> 01:19:20,377
Shut your mouth and we will.

1007
01:19:20,422 --> 01:19:22,185
-- Which was?
-- Come on.

1008
01:19:23,291 --> 01:19:25,885
-- Where are we going?
-- We must talk.

1009
01:19:29,698 --> 01:19:32,132
Te thought sr. Tolson.

1010
01:19:49,217 --> 01:19:51,151
Ok, she feels ...

1011
01:19:55,223 --> 01:19:56,850
Come here ...

1012
01:19:56,925 --> 01:19:58,552
... Gives me a hug.

1013
01:19:59,828 --> 01:20:01,318
Stop.

1014
01:20:11,039 --> 01:20:12,700
It has no value ...

1015
01:20:12,741 --> 01:20:14,140
How?

1016
01:20:14,176 --> 01:20:16,736
Believes that you are the only one affected?

1017
01:20:22,050 --> 01:20:24,109
Ok, I feel very ...

1018
01:20:24,152 --> 01:20:26,245
... By all ...

1019
01:20:28,790 --> 01:20:30,087
... By drinking ...

1020
01:20:31,459 --> 01:20:33,427
... I am sorry.

1021
01:20:33,461 --> 01:20:37,591
I am not talking about me.

1022
01:20:52,113 --> 01:20:54,274
Ok

1023
01:20:54,316 --> 01:20:55,977
I will deal with it.

1024
01:20:57,285 --> 01:21:00,015
It will not, she does not have to see you so.

1025
01:21:00,722 --> 01:21:02,121
No, all is well,
Talk to her ...

1026
01:21:02,224 --> 01:21:03,851
Let me resolve
My things alone

1027
01:21:10,565 --> 01:21:13,329
Calma boy, stop.

1028
01:21:14,236 --> 01:21:16,067
Stop, I am not fighting you.

1029
01:21:16,137 --> 01:21:17,900
Easy.

1030
01:21:17,939 --> 01:21:19,531
You are crazy?

1031
01:21:23,345 --> 01:21:26,746
Never forget what
Seen, never forgotten.

1032
01:21:27,549 --> 01:21:30,177
These are the ones who can
Cut your fingers,

1033
01:21:30,252 --> 01:21:32,686
Your fingers, your nose, your ears.

1034
01:21:32,754 --> 01:21:34,813
Sometimes the parties have intimate.

1035
01:21:34,856 --> 01:21:37,484
Sometimes you degolam alive.

1036
01:21:40,295 --> 01:21:43,389
We never can forget that.

1037
01:21:58,580 --> 01:21:59,569
Believed that?

1038
01:21:59,614 --> 01:22:02,515
You will not do anything
James, does nothing.

1039
01:22:02,550 --> 01:22:05,018
In Texas, lincham the black.

1040
01:22:05,053 --> 01:22:06,714
It?

1041
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:10,451
So no matter what the make?

1042
01:22:10,525 --> 01:22:12,288
What tá speaking ... what?

1043
01:22:12,327 --> 01:22:14,386
All this is useless.

1044
01:22:14,429 --> 01:22:16,124
What am I talking about?

1045
01:22:17,032 --> 01:22:21,435
We are only discussing topics blacks
With which we agree.

1046
01:22:21,469 --> 01:22:24,063
James, does not speak well.

1047
01:22:24,139 --> 01:22:26,767
-- Why not ...?
-- Why can not.

1048
01:22:27,742 --> 01:22:29,937
You do not.

1049
01:23:13,922 --> 01:23:16,117
Goodbye, God bless.

1050
01:23:19,961 --> 01:23:21,656
Where is Samantha?

1051
01:23:21,730 --> 01:23:23,197
It is not going to us.

1052
01:23:23,231 --> 01:23:24,721
Why not?

1053
01:23:24,766 --> 01:23:26,825
What do you think?

1054
01:23:27,068 --> 01:23:28,365
Take it to the road.

1055
01:23:28,536 --> 01:23:30,333
To come back to school.

1056
01:23:32,440 --> 01:23:36,433
I want this opportunity? This is your chance.

1057
01:23:42,450 --> 01:23:44,884
How can any black ...

1058
01:23:44,953 --> 01:23:47,387
... Defend the punishment of imprisonment ...

1059
01:23:47,455 --> 01:23:51,152
... When such exercises
Oppression in their own lives?

1060
01:23:53,962 --> 01:23:54,360
How?

1061
01:23:54,396 --> 01:23:58,958
Because the crime itself
Is a form of oppression.

1062
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:02,629
And the blacks are the victims
Of violent crimes,

1063
01:24:02,704 --> 01:24:06,196
But that ninhuma another race in America.

1064
01:24:09,044 --> 01:24:10,511
For us.

1065
01:24:10,545 --> 01:24:15,107
... The arrest not only offers
Protection, but retribution.

1066
01:24:15,150 --> 01:24:16,139
Yes, it is so.

1067
01:24:16,217 --> 01:24:17,878
And for the criminals ...

1068
01:24:17,919 --> 01:24:20,717
... Is in reality a gift ...

1069
01:24:20,755 --> 01:24:23,815
... A shame that
Presents ...

1070
01:24:26,027 --> 01:24:28,621
... Which increases their
Passion for freedom ...

1071
01:24:29,030 --> 01:24:31,021
... Their hope for redemption.

1072
01:24:39,474 --> 01:24:42,307
Our next debate brings
University of Wiley,

1073
01:24:42,343 --> 01:24:45,073
Represented by
Mr. James Farmer Junior.

1074
01:24:45,146 --> 01:24:47,740
Mr. Farmer.

1075
01:25:49,944 --> 01:25:51,673
Mamãe.

1076
01:25:57,352 --> 01:25:59,252
Mamãe.

1077
01:26:30,418 --> 01:26:31,442
Dear.

1078
01:26:33,021 --> 01:26:34,147
Hi

1079
01:26:38,026 --> 01:26:39,459
Then ...

1080
01:26:41,429 --> 01:26:42,828
We lost.

1081
01:26:42,864 --> 01:26:44,923
Sorry.

1082
01:26:46,768 --> 01:26:48,531
Reached it.

1083
01:26:50,371 --> 01:26:51,929
Harvard.

1084
01:26:52,674 --> 01:26:53,538
Who says?

1085
01:26:53,575 --> 01:26:56,635
-- Opened and read it?
-- It seems that someone opened before.

1086
01:26:56,678 --> 01:26:58,339
It was not me.

1087
01:26:59,280 --> 01:27:01,874
-- Do not opened?
-- No.

1088
01:27:02,984 --> 01:27:04,918
It is not a good lie.

1089
01:27:09,724 --> 01:27:11,692
In aloud.

1090
01:27:14,796 --> 01:27:17,993
Mr. Tolson. Thank you for
Know your victory ...

1091
01:27:18,032 --> 01:27:22,435
... In the city. Where will
Mind that the season

1092
01:27:22,503 --> 01:27:24,528
Is ending, but
Today rebemos another letter, ...

1093
01:27:24,606 --> 01:27:27,131
His University, drafted
By sr. Henry Lowe.

1094
01:27:27,208 --> 01:27:31,440
Given the prospect of their
Students about ...

1095
01:27:32,313 --> 01:27:35,612
... Their season invicta. It is no longer invicta.
-- No matter.

1096
01:27:36,351 --> 01:27:39,013
We want to extend
Our invitation to ...

1097
01:27:50,431 --> 01:27:54,333
We would like to extend our
Invitation to the discussion of Harvard,

1098
01:27:55,169 --> 01:27:57,330
... Here in Cambridge.

1099
01:27:57,372 --> 01:27:59,966
Well, it is that you are in agreement.

1100
01:28:09,917 --> 01:28:11,885
-- Do not tell anyone.
-- No.

1101
01:28:24,198 --> 01:28:25,825
There has to thank me.

1102
01:28:26,301 --> 01:28:29,395
I just wanted to show that could have
Also reason
-- Okay, thanks.

1103
01:28:31,439 --> 01:28:32,599
I wanted to ask a favor.

1104
01:28:33,808 --> 01:28:34,206
What is it?

1105
01:28:38,112 --> 01:28:40,603
Keep Samantha in the team?

1106
01:28:43,017 --> 01:28:44,985
Why would it?

1107
01:28:45,019 --> 01:28:47,351
Mr. Tolson was a very difficult night.

1108
01:28:47,422 --> 01:28:49,049
So, Mr. Lowe.

1109
01:28:49,123 --> 01:28:51,114
For all of us.

1110
01:28:51,159 --> 01:28:53,719
And she wanted to be separated,
Us this evening.

1111
01:28:53,761 --> 01:28:56,161
Not Sr. Was not of us.

1112
01:28:57,765 --> 01:29:00,256
She wanted to be separated from me.

1113
01:29:07,608 --> 01:29:09,701
It is a good tea.

1114
01:29:09,777 --> 01:29:11,108
Resolve ...

1115
01:29:11,179 --> 01:29:15,639
... What capitalism is a moral
That discussing affirmative.

1116
01:29:15,683 --> 01:29:18,277
They are a bunch of bankers fatty.

1117
01:29:20,188 --> 01:29:22,986
Mr. Tolson, I accepted in your team ...

1118
01:29:23,024 --> 01:29:26,187
He arrived late, it is based.

1119
01:29:35,837 --> 01:29:37,395
Samantha, I do not ...

1120
01:29:47,415 --> 01:29:49,406
Decide.

1121
01:29:58,459 --> 01:30:02,395
Placed macaroni and cheese, roast chicken,
Beans to good luck,

1122
01:30:02,430 --> 01:30:05,627
Red Beans, bread, salt,
Rods, caramel,

1123
01:30:05,666 --> 01:30:10,228
Also put pudding, I know that not
Like but could not avoid.

1124
01:30:11,239 --> 01:30:12,797
Thanks Mom.

1125
01:30:12,840 --> 01:30:15,240
Good luck son.

1126
01:30:17,645 --> 01:30:18,942
Daddy ...

1127
01:30:18,980 --> 01:30:21,039
Tell me son.

1128
01:30:23,951 --> 01:30:26,818
It will take all the credit, okay?

1129
01:30:26,854 --> 01:30:29,049
Yes sir.

1130
01:30:30,558 --> 01:30:32,389
Come on, the train will have.

1131
01:30:32,460 --> 01:30:34,257
I will.

1132
01:30:40,768 --> 01:30:42,360
-- Bye Mom.
-- Farewell son.

1133
01:30:46,474 --> 01:30:47,338
The love.

1134
01:30:47,375 --> 01:30:50,401
You love it.

1135
01:31:00,021 --> 01:31:02,012
All aboard.

1136
01:31:02,723 --> 01:31:05,123
-- I will not go with you.
-- What?

1137
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:08,456
I can not leave the state
By the conditions of my bail.

1138
01:31:08,529 --> 01:31:09,689
Not that is preventing.

1139
01:31:09,730 --> 01:31:11,322
They do not hinder me.

1140
01:31:12,433 --> 01:31:15,231
... Does not want for
At risk your chance.

1141
01:31:16,237 --> 01:31:19,206
They can do without me, it was the
They wanted all the time. Right?

1142
01:31:19,240 --> 01:31:20,867
Is right.

1143
01:31:20,942 --> 01:31:22,432
Why not tell us before?

1144
01:31:22,543 --> 01:31:26,035
I did not want to hear their arguments,
Knew it would be very good.

1145
01:31:32,687 --> 01:31:34,951
Mr. Lowe you are responsible.

1146
01:31:34,989 --> 01:31:37,890
Listen to what it says your instincts.

1147
01:31:37,959 --> 01:31:40,359
-- Yes senho.
-- Ahead.

1148
01:31:44,966 --> 01:31:47,298
What should we do without you?

1149
01:31:47,368 --> 01:31:49,563
Win.

1150
01:33:29,537 --> 01:33:31,835
I hope someone find us.

1151
01:33:38,045 --> 01:33:40,377
-- University of Wiley?
-- Yes

1152
01:33:40,448 --> 01:33:43,645

1156
01:33:49,457 --> 01:33:51,721

01:33:51,759 --> 01:33:53,624
-- So I take.
-- Thank you.

1158
01:33:53,661 --> 01:33:56,061
To know that when you get to campus.

1159
01:33:56,097 --> 01:33:59,589
This debate has created
Much excitement.

1160
01:33:59,667 --> 01:34:01,066
-- Really?
-- Yes

1161
01:34:01,102 --> 01:34:03,297
It will be broadcast across America.

1162
01:34:03,337 --> 01:34:07,000
-- We can see where we discuss?
-- Sure it is.

1163
01:34:35,736 --> 01:34:38,830
Hello Harvard.

1164
01:34:54,055 --> 01:34:55,317
Sorry.

1165
01:34:55,356 --> 01:34:57,449
I suppose that are here?

1166
01:34:59,994 --> 01:35:03,088
I believe that the find. Right?

1167
01:35:23,317 --> 01:35:25,808
Look, Mr. Farmer.

1168
01:35:30,558 --> 01:35:32,423
5 US dollars?

1169
01:35:32,460 --> 01:35:34,451
Lowe, I have 5 US dollars.

1170
01:35:34,528 --> 01:35:37,122
Yes, I also share.

1171
01:35:38,332 --> 01:35:41,563
-- We spend?
-- No, not my 5 US dollars.

1172
01:35:48,442 --> 01:35:52,503
I have 5 US dollars. I have 5 US dollars.

1173
01:35:52,546 --> 01:35:53,706
Me too.

1174
01:35:53,748 --> 01:35:56,080
Well those are my best.

1175
01:35:57,051 --> 01:36:00,509
James, this is a sophisticated tea.

1176
01:36:01,522 --> 01:36:06,050
The noble, do not take without protocol.

1177
01:36:06,093 --> 01:36:07,822
As you know?

1178
01:36:07,895 --> 01:36:09,590
I do not know.

1179
01:36:11,132 --> 01:36:15,034
Hello, I am Wilson. This is for you

1180
01:36:15,936 --> 01:36:17,631
Thanks.

1181
01:36:20,541 --> 01:36:25,001
I can not accept that
Mr. Would be inappropriate.

1182
01:36:30,417 --> 01:36:32,544
"It would be inappropriate."

1183
01:36:34,655 --> 01:36:37,283
-- Who is it?
-- From Harvard.

1184
01:36:37,324 --> 01:36:39,224
In gave more money.

1185
01:36:39,827 --> 01:36:43,524
We have been informed,
That his team handed ...

1186
01:36:44,932 --> 01:36:47,230
... Discusos not approved ...

1187
01:36:47,268 --> 01:36:50,829
... By arguments written by
Faculty and students.

1188
01:36:51,472 --> 01:36:54,566
They will have to change their topic of
Talk now has the same

1189
01:36:54,642 --> 01:36:58,169
Time that the team from Harvard
To rewrite. 48 hours.

1190
01:37:00,080 --> 01:37:02,844
God helps
Students all the time.

1191
01:37:02,883 --> 01:37:04,214
Yes sir.

1192
01:37:04,285 --> 01:37:07,379
The two teams will be delivered
The same reference books.

1193
01:37:07,421 --> 01:37:12,051
The new topic arises, the disobedience
Civil morality is a weapon to fight for justice.

1194
01:37:12,092 --> 01:37:15,459
The University of Wiley will
Discussing the affirmative.

1195
01:37:15,496 --> 01:37:16,622
Thank you.

1196
01:37:19,900 --> 01:37:21,333
I can not communicate with me sir. Tolson.

1197
01:37:21,702 --> 01:37:23,135
Nobody knows where he is.

1198
01:37:23,204 --> 01:37:24,967
You are in our hands.

1199
01:37:25,005 --> 01:37:26,370
We can not do without it.

1200
01:37:26,407 --> 01:37:31,106
You are mistaken, not
We can win without it.

1201
01:37:34,114 --> 01:37:35,911
Drought?

1202
01:37:43,224 --> 01:37:45,158
Aquie is your coffee sir.

1203
01:37:45,226 --> 01:37:46,557
Thank you Mr. Wilson.

1204
01:37:46,627 --> 01:37:48,424
Only Wilson.

1205
01:37:52,933 --> 01:37:54,992
-- Did you use ...
-- But is that ...

1206
01:37:55,035 --> 01:37:59,938
Lee, James, let's wait, we
That await the best stop the final.

1207
01:37:59,974 --> 01:38:02,807
Why is that
Head to the hearing ...

1208
01:38:03,477 --> 01:38:06,207
I think we should include this in Graha ...

1209
01:38:06,280 --> 01:38:11,183
I disagree, I do not believe that
People understand this, "saragarra" ...

1210
01:38:12,620 --> 01:38:18,286
"Sarcher graha" ... the sânscritos,
Siginifica truth and justice.

1211
01:38:26,600 --> 01:38:28,261
Te said.

1212
01:38:28,302 --> 01:38:31,032
It is clear to me that we must
Start the debate with Ghandi.

1213
01:38:31,105 --> 01:38:32,333
That is precisely what I will do.

1214
01:38:32,406 --> 01:38:33,668
Why start with the obvious?

1215
01:38:33,707 --> 01:38:35,106
Because that is what wins the debate.

1216
01:38:35,142 --> 01:38:36,905
Listen to what I said, this is Harvard.

1217
01:38:36,944 --> 01:38:39,640
The first should say that, it
Which means disobedience ...

1218
01:38:40,648 --> 01:38:41,842
Ghandi is a poet strong.

1219
01:38:41,916 --> 01:38:43,440
I want to win. You want to win?

1220
01:38:43,517 --> 01:38:44,449
Do I want to win.

1221
01:38:46,120 --> 01:38:48,111
This is the way we win.

1222
01:38:48,923 --> 01:38:51,050
He asked
Responsible. Not to you.

1223
01:38:52,426 --> 01:38:53,358
I am who makes the decision.

1224
01:38:53,427 --> 01:38:54,621
We will not start with Ghandi.

1225
01:38:56,730 --> 01:38:59,961
-- You are a marica.
-- You are an idiot.

1226
01:39:00,968 --> 01:39:02,526
Ah, I am an idiot?

1227
01:39:02,569 --> 01:39:05,595
When the two devil,
To hell with the debate.

1228
01:39:05,673 --> 01:39:09,006
When I devil?
Just because you fix?

1229
01:39:22,690 --> 01:39:25,488
-- She will return right?
-- You will see when you arrive.

1230
01:41:32,086 --> 01:41:34,452
It is beautiful when sleeping.

1231
01:41:48,268 --> 01:41:49,826
Yes, I know, I know ...

1232
01:41:49,870 --> 01:41:52,862
It can not prevent me from you look.

1233
01:41:53,774 --> 01:41:56,174
Shut your mouth a little.

1234
01:41:57,678 --> 01:41:59,873
James, come on, stand up.

1235
01:41:59,913 --> 01:42:01,403
No.

1236
01:42:01,448 --> 01:42:03,109
James ...

1237
01:42:07,421 --> 01:42:09,616
Let James, Levante.

1238
01:42:15,629 --> 01:42:17,221
What?

1239
01:42:22,236 --> 01:42:23,760
What is this?

1240
01:42:25,239 --> 01:42:27,264
These are my notes.

1241
01:42:28,342 --> 01:42:30,537
What is giving me?

1242
01:42:30,577 --> 01:42:33,171
Because you discuss in my place

1243
01:42:33,247 --> 01:42:35,078
What?

1244
01:42:35,149 --> 01:42:36,946
It is your time James.

1245
01:42:36,984 --> 01:42:38,884
You are talking serious?

1246
01:42:39,887 --> 01:42:42,685
-- You are crazy.
-- Has 14 years and is as good as me.

1247
01:42:42,756 --> 01:42:44,018
The judges will love you.

1248
01:42:44,057 --> 01:42:45,615
No, not up.

1249
01:42:45,659 --> 01:42:47,957
I am not giving up Samantha.

1250
01:42:49,963 --> 01:42:53,763
Tolson made me captain, and told me
You were ready.


1251
01:42:54,668 --> 01:42:56,863
You saw me the other
Instead, it was horrible.

1252
01:42:56,904 --> 01:43:00,237
Yes, it was terrible. T
Arrested aquel point. Right?

1253
01:43:00,307 --> 01:43:03,708
So. So I will quit,
So will render?

1254
01:43:06,513 --> 01:43:08,003
No.

1255
01:43:13,520 --> 01:43:15,920
Who is the judge?

1256
01:43:16,823 --> 01:43:18,222
What?

1257
01:43:18,258 --> 01:43:20,818
What is the judge?

1258
01:43:22,829 --> 01:43:25,127
The judge is God.

1259
01:43:25,866 --> 01:43:28,426
And why is He?

1260
01:43:29,736 --> 01:43:34,036
Why He decides who wins and
Loser, not my opponent.

1261
01:43:34,942 --> 01:43:37,467
Who is your opponent?

1262
01:43:37,544 --> 01:43:40,206
There is.

1263
01:43:40,247 --> 01:43:42,545
Why not?

1264
01:43:43,150 --> 01:43:48,053
Because it is only a distant voice
Face the truth that I speak.

1265
01:43:50,257 --> 01:43:53,590
Correct. Speak the truth.

1266
01:43:54,861 --> 01:43:59,127
Directly from Harvard, in the Classroom
Magna, in Cambridge Massuchusetts,

1267
01:43:59,166 --> 01:44:05,036
This is the WNBC Radio, bringing
Live the debate that will make history.

1268
01:44:05,105 --> 01:44:08,370
Among the small teams
University of Wiley, Texas,

1269
01:44:08,408 --> 01:44:10,808
And the team of
Harvard University.

1270
01:44:10,844 --> 01:44:15,110
For the first time a small team
Sees the champions of Harvard.

1271
01:44:15,148 --> 01:44:19,107
Who climbs on the stage now,
And the audience is silent.

1272
01:44:21,755 --> 01:44:23,655
On this special occasion,

1273
01:44:23,724 --> 01:44:26,022
We welcome as a separate
Universdidade team of Wiley.

1274
01:44:26,727 --> 01:44:32,723
Presenting the judges, the audience,
And through the radio, the nation.

1275
01:44:33,567 --> 01:44:37,128
The University of Harvard celebrates
300 of his birthday this year.

1276
01:44:37,738 --> 01:44:42,505
Thanking the Franklin Eleanor Roosevelt,
5 th President of the USA.

1277
01:44:42,542 --> 01:44:46,535
But throughout University, no matter
How big is your history,

1278
01:44:46,580 --> 01:44:49,071
Can not allow live in your past,

1279
01:44:49,149 --> 01:44:52,414
Then the spirit of tomorrow,

1280
01:44:52,452 --> 01:44:55,979
The present today,

1281
01:44:57,057 --> 01:44:59,321
Debatedores the University of Wiley.

1282
01:44:59,359 --> 01:45:02,590
Samantha and Booke
Mr. James Farmer Junior.

1283
01:45:14,508 --> 01:45:18,000
Mr. Farmer discuss
The first yes.

1284
01:45:37,264 --> 01:45:39,789
Resolvo:

1285
01:45:39,833 --> 01:45:45,135
The civil disobedience is a weapon
Morality in the fight for justice.

1286
01:45:46,039 --> 01:45:49,270
But how can consider such a thing?

1287
01:45:49,343 --> 01:45:52,335
I think it depends on
Definition of the words.

1288
01:45:53,847 --> 01:45:55,747
Word.

1289
01:45:56,850 --> 01:46:01,253
In 1899 in India, 10
Thousand people gathered,

1290
01:46:01,288 --> 01:46:04,280
To protest
The laws of tyranny.

1291
01:46:04,324 --> 01:46:05,154
We started?

1292
01:46:05,192 --> 01:46:07,319
Your brother is talking, feel.

1293
01:46:07,394 --> 01:46:10,625
The Gal. Reginald Dyer,
The trancou a courtyard,

1294
01:46:10,697 --> 01:46:14,690
The soldiers for their
Confrontassem for 10 minutes.

1295
01:46:16,303 --> 01:46:18,897
379 died.

1296
01:46:19,406 --> 01:46:24,207
Men, women, children,
Murdered in cold blood.

1297
01:46:25,445 --> 01:46:28,903
Dyer said that through
Give them a lesson.

1298
01:46:29,649 --> 01:46:33,050
And people do not
Responded with violence,

1299
01:46:33,720 --> 01:46:37,554
And yes with a campaign
Organised of non-cooperation.

1300
01:46:38,625 --> 01:46:40,820
The buildings of
Government were occupied,

1301
01:46:40,861 --> 01:46:43,796
The streets of people
Which is denied to move.

1302
01:46:43,830 --> 01:46:46,355
Still being beaten by the police.

1303
01:46:46,433 --> 01:46:48,333
Gandhi was arrested.

1304
01:46:48,368 --> 01:46:51,132
But the British were
Obliged to release him.

1305
01:46:52,139 --> 01:46:55,165
The called "a moral victory".

1306
01:46:56,443 --> 01:46:58,707
The definition of morality:

1307
01:46:58,745 --> 01:47:02,476
Assassination of Dyer,
Or the victory of Ghandi?

1308
01:47:03,283 --> 01:47:05,114
You decide.

1309
01:47:22,702 --> 01:47:25,136
- 1914 1918,

1310
01:47:25,906 --> 01:47:29,433
The world was at war with each minute.

1311
01:47:31,111 --> 01:47:34,706
4 men gave their lives.

1312
01:47:35,615 --> 01:47:37,810
Just think them.

1313
01:47:37,851 --> 01:47:41,184
240 young and brave men,

1314
01:47:41,221 --> 01:47:44,952
Were sentenced every hour
Every day,

1315
01:47:45,025 --> 01:47:48,324
Of each night for long 4 years.

1316
01:47:51,431 --> 01:47:54,525
35 thousand hours.

1317
01:47:55,135 --> 01:48:00,664
8,281,000 casualties.

1318
01:48:02,876 --> 01:48:11,978
240

1319
01:48:12,586 --> 01:48:17,489
And here the fact immeasurable
Katerikoli another before the event.

1320
01:48:19,092 --> 01:48:22,323
Is there anything moral about this?


1321
01:48:23,296 --> 01:48:25,059
Nothing.

1322
01:48:25,098 --> 01:48:28,727
Except that Germany wanted
Enslave all of Europe.

1323
01:48:29,636 --> 01:48:33,629
The civil disobedience not
It is moral because it is not violent.

1324
01:48:33,707 --> 01:48:38,974
Fighting with violence to defend
Their country is the most profoundly moral.

1325
01:48:39,012 --> 01:48:43,210
Demandando large
Sacrifices of all.

1326
01:48:44,518 --> 01:48:46,748
The life itself.

1327
01:48:46,820 --> 01:48:50,347
The non-violence, is the mask
Pões so that the civil disobedience

1328
01:48:50,423 --> 01:48:52,653
To conceal its true face.

1329
01:48:54,461 --> 01:48:56,224
The anarchy.

1330
01:49:08,074 --> 01:49:10,907
Gandhi believed that should always act

1331
01:49:10,977 --> 01:49:13,468
With love and respect against his opponents.

1332
01:49:13,513 --> 01:49:17,074
So when are debatedores Harvard.

1333
01:49:18,084 --> 01:49:20,848
Gandhi also believed that
Those quebravam the law,

1334
01:49:20,887 --> 01:49:24,721
Would have to accept the consequences
Legal of their actions.

1335
01:49:25,392 --> 01:49:28,122
That sounds like Anarchy?

1336
01:49:28,194 --> 01:49:32,494
The social disobedience, not
It is something we should fear.

1337
01:49:33,199 --> 01:49:35,895
It is after all
American a concept.

1338
01:49:35,936 --> 01:49:39,929
Gandhi was not their inspiration
In the Indian scriptures,

1339
01:49:40,006 --> 01:49:44,500
But by Henry David Drough that
I was graduated in Harvard,

1340
01:49:44,544 --> 01:49:48,605
Guided by those who do not
Are very far from here.

1341
01:49:55,422 --> 01:49:57,913
My opponent is right in one aspect.

1342
01:49:58,758 --> 01:50:01,454
Drough was a graduate of Harvard,

1343
01:50:01,528 --> 01:50:03,894
And how many of us,

1344
01:50:03,930 --> 01:50:06,558
Bet that expanded their intellect.

1345
01:50:08,535 --> 01:50:11,698
He wanted to say:

1346
01:50:11,738 --> 01:50:13,603
"Any man more
Letrado that its neighbours,

1347
01:50:13,640 --> 01:50:16,973
Constiutui a majority of one. "

1348
01:50:17,477 --> 01:50:20,139
Words that Drought not calculated,

1349
01:50:21,047 --> 01:50:24,983
That Adolf Hitler studied
As them.

1350
01:50:26,486 --> 01:50:30,582
The beauty and value of
Democracy is this:

1351
01:50:30,657 --> 01:50:35,617
"No idea without prevalesce
The support of the majority ".

1352
01:50:35,662 --> 01:50:38,654
The people who decide the
Moral standards of his time,

1353
01:50:38,698 --> 01:50:41,462
Not a majority of one.

1354
01:50:41,501 --> 01:50:45,631
The majority did not decide
What is right or wrong.

1355
01:50:45,672 --> 01:50:48,038
But the conscience yes.

1356
01:50:48,074 --> 01:50:52,477
Because our citizens,
Entregariam their conscience

1357
01:50:52,579 --> 01:50:54,706
By the opinion of a majority.

1358
01:50:54,781 --> 01:50:58,740
We never, never in dobraríamos.

1359
01:50:58,785 --> 01:51:03,347
Forward the belief of any majority.

1360
01:51:10,130 --> 01:51:13,896
We can not choose which laws
Obey, or which ignore.

1361
01:51:13,933 --> 01:51:18,370
If we could never
Pararíamos in the red.

1362
01:51:20,173 --> 01:51:25,042
My father is one of the men
That are between us and chaos.

1363
01:51:26,446 --> 01:51:29,108
It is official police.

1364
01:51:29,149 --> 01:51:31,640
I remember a day that her partner,

1365
01:51:32,452 --> 01:51:34,249
His best friend,

1366
01:51:34,354 --> 01:51:37,687
Was overthrown in the fulfillment of the duty.

1367
01:51:39,159 --> 01:51:44,563
But vivid than the other, I
The expression on the face of my father.

1368
01:51:47,667 --> 01:51:49,635
Nothing ...

1369
01:51:49,669 --> 01:51:53,571
... That impedes the performance of
Law can be moral.

1370
01:51:53,606 --> 01:51:56,973
No matter where it dermos.

1371
01:52:46,760 --> 01:52:48,352
Why not say something?

1372
01:53:05,512 --> 01:53:07,742
In Texas ...

1373
01:53:09,516 --> 01:53:12,007
... Lincham the black.

1374
01:53:13,620 --> 01:53:15,747
My companions and I,

1375
01:53:15,822 --> 01:53:18,518
Saw a man hanging by the neck.

1376
01:53:19,826 --> 01:53:22,727
What had also been burned.

1377
01:53:23,763 --> 01:53:26,459
Fugimos the flock of linchadores.

1378
01:53:27,934 --> 01:53:31,734
Pressionamos our faces
Against the floor of the car.

1379
01:53:35,141 --> 01:53:37,769
I looked for my teammates.

1380
01:53:38,378 --> 01:53:40,346
I saw the fear in their eyes.

1381
01:53:42,949 --> 01:53:47,784
And worse, the shame.

1382
01:53:50,590 --> 01:53:53,115
What was the crime that black?

1383
01:53:53,159 --> 01:53:58,392
What should be placed without judgement,
In a forest dark and foggy.

1384
01:53:59,766 --> 01:54:01,700
He was a thief?

1385
01:54:02,602 --> 01:54:04,627
He was a murderer?

1386
01:54:05,638 --> 01:54:08,334
Or just a black?

1387
01:54:09,409 --> 01:54:11,809
It was a worker?

1388
01:54:12,512 --> 01:54:14,207
A preacher?

1389
01:54:14,848 --> 01:54:17,715
His children were waiting for him?

1390
01:54:19,018 --> 01:54:21,953
Who was next?

1391
01:54:22,021 --> 01:54:26,151
And did nothing.

1392
01:54:27,227 --> 01:54:31,721
No matter what was done,
Linchadores were criminals.

1393
01:54:32,832 --> 01:54:35,062
But the law did nothing,

1394
01:54:35,134 --> 01:54:39,332
So we are asking: Why?

1395
01:54:44,677 --> 01:54:46,804
My opponent said:

1396
01:54:46,846 --> 01:54:50,373
"Nothing that break the law
Can be moral. "

1397
01:54:51,150 --> 01:54:54,449
But do not be written law
Say that the black

1398
01:54:54,487 --> 01:54:57,581
Has no right to a home, that
Are rejected in schools,

1399
01:54:57,657 --> 01:55:01,388
In hospitals, nor
We are linchados.

1400
01:55:05,498 --> 01:55:07,796
St. Augustine said:

1401
01:55:07,834 --> 01:55:11,429
"An unjust law is not law."

1402
01:55:12,205 --> 01:55:16,505
What I have
Right, even the duty to resist.

1403
01:55:18,711 --> 01:55:23,705
With violence or civil disobedience ...

1404
01:55:28,021 --> 01:55:31,718
They should pray because
Chose the latter.

1405
01:56:02,088 --> 01:56:03,453
In the debate tonight,

1406
01:56:03,489 --> 01:56:06,014
Between Harvard University,

1407
01:56:06,893 --> 01:56:09,589
And the University of Wiley.

1408
01:56:12,532 --> 01:56:15,399
The winner is ....

1409
01:56:37,023 --> 01:56:40,117
The University of Wiley.

1410
01:58:01,374 --> 01:58:04,309
Only 7 years later in
1942 James Farmer Junior

1411
01:58:05,178 --> 01:58:08,272
Founded the Congress of Racial Equality.

1412
01:58:08,781 --> 01:58:11,909
And became a leader in the
Civil rights movement.

1413
01:58:14,120 --> 01:58:16,884
After a long life
To teach and write.

1414
01:58:17,423 --> 01:58:20,722
James Farmer father, died in 1961.

1415
01:58:21,894 --> 01:58:24,829
The day before
Samantha Booke, lawyer,

1416
01:58:25,431 --> 01:58:27,991
It took the first trip
The freedom to Alabama.

1417
01:58:30,436 --> 01:58:32,802
Henry Lowe was studying theology

1418
01:58:33,306 --> 01:58:36,036
At the University of California.

1419
01:58:36,509 --> 01:58:39,137
And became a minister.

1420
01:58:41,214 --> 01:58:44,206
Melvin Tolson became a
World-renowned poet.

1421
01:58:44,717 --> 01:58:48,016
It continues its work in
Sulista Farmers Union.

1422
01:58:48,621 --> 01:58:52,751
At the end of 1936, had
31 thousand members in 7 states.

1423
01:58:57,163 --> 01:59:02,191
For ten years of discussions the team of
University of Wiley was unbeatable.

1424
01:59:02,192 --> 01:59:05,392
