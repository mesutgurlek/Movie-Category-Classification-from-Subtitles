1
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:17,640
Subtitles ripped and resynched
by ShooCat

2
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,600
- How'd it go, Tom?
- Oh, thrashed 'em.

3
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,720
Led all the way.

4
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,280
Lydia wanted trouble
this evening, Christopher.

5
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,560
Any news of Julian?
I suppose he's all right, is he?

6
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,960
Julian? Yes, he's fine.
I think he went down to London.

7
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,560
- I ordered the '45.
- Beg your pardon.

8
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,560
Jack? Jack.

9
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,360
- Jack, what a surprise.
- What do you mean, surprise?

10
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,000
Not out plying your trade?

11
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,800
What trade is that, Christopher?

12
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,720
I see you as a species
of medieval pedler...

13
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:11,520
selling relics of the saints
of dubious authenticity.

14
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,240
Don't complain, Christopher.
Jack's no Roman. I can vouch for that.

15
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,800
I speak metaphorically, Harry.
Jack's trade is the manufacture...

16
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,520
and supply of easy answers
to difficult questions.

17
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,680
What's he say?

18
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,720
He says Jack has easy answers
for difficult questions.

19
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,440
I've been meaning to ask
about your brother's books.

20
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,040
Does he actually know
any children?

21
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,720
- Jack? I don't think so.
- How on Earth does he pull it off?

22
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,480
Barker, this isn't
the Charmontagne '45?

23
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,560
To the best of my belief,
it is, sir.

24
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,360
- Just one moment, sir.
- No, Nick, no.

25
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,000
You do not agree with Marcus.
You disagree with Marcus.

26
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,040
But Marcus says
he agrees with me. Marc?

27
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,040
Marcus has no real grasp
of his own thought processes.

28
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,360
Also, he tells
the most terrible lies.

29
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,400
I'm intrigued, Jack. Apparently
you don't know any actual children.

30
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,960
- That's balderdash.
- I'm sure Rupert could spare...

31
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,840
one or two of his brood.

32
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,760
Jack, you forgot my wine.

33
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,200
- There.
- Thank you, Barker.

34
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,280
Who says I don't know
any children? You?

35
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:13,200
- Warnie.
- My brother was a child once, Rupert...

36
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,160
and, as unlikely as it may seem,
so was I.

37
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,520
Thursday tomorrow, Jack.

38
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,040
Yes. The week's almost gone
and I haven't done half my letters.

39
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,640
- You don't have to write back, you know.
- Don't have to write back. I know.

40
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,800
- It merely encourages them.
- Yes.

41
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,480
"Mr. C.S. Lewis thanks you
for your letter...

42
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,360
but has nothing whatsoever
to say in reply."

43
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,440
It's going to be
quite a frost tonight, Warnie.

44
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,320
Too many stars. Confuses me.

45
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,840
Nightcap?

46
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,760
Don't think so.

47
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,720
- There you are.
- London tomorrow.

48
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,400
Who are you lecturing?
Disabled veterans?

49
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:35,360
- Church widows?
- Association of Christian Teachers.

50
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,360
- Night, Jack.
- Night, Warnie.

51
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:01,200
Garden, enclosed by a high wall.

52
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,680
Inside the garden,
a fountain.

53
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,240
In the fountain,
two crystal stones.

54
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:09,760
In the crystals, in reflection,
a rose garden.

55
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,480
In the midst of the roses,
one perfect rosebud.

56
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,640
Guillaume de Lorris is using
the rosebud, of course...

57
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,720
as an image.

58
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,240
But an image of what?

59
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,560
- Love?
- What kind of love?

60
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,600
Untouched?

61
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:29,040
- Unopened, like a bud?
- Yes. More?

62
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,760
- Perfect love.
- What makes it perfect?

63
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,440
- Come on, wake up.
- Is it the courtly ideal of love?

64
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,920
What is that?
What is its one essential quality?

65
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,360
- Un...
- Unattainability.

66
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,120
The most intense joy
lies not in the having...

67
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,840
but in the desiring.

68
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:50,520
Delight that never fades,
bliss that is eternal...

69
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:55,000
is only yours when what
you most desire is just out of reach.

70
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:00,000
- What was that, Mr. Whistler?
- Nothing, Mr. Lewis.

71
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,360
If you disagree with me,
say so.

72
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,400
Fight me.
I can take it.

73
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:08,360
Even I can't fight
on both sides at once, you know.

74
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:11,080
Or, at least I can,
but I'm liable to win.

75
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:19,160
Why is the beer here
always cold? Cold beer!

76
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,560
Chills the stomach.
Has no taste.

77
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,520
I have a complaint
about the wardrobe.

78
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,720
Complaint?
Our children love it.

79
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,360
I will not have another conversation
about Jack's blasted nursery.

80
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,480
No. Listen.

81
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,560
In the book you describe the house
as belonging to an old professor...

82
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,960
who has no wife,
and yet...

83
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:40,760
you say that when the little girl
enters the magic wardrobe...

84
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,640
she finds it full of fur coats.

85
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,720
- Oh, very good, Eddie.
- It's simple.

86
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,680
It belonged to the professor's
old mother. Simple.

87
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,320
Aha. So,
to reach the magic world...

88
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,440
the child must push through
the mother's fur.

89
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,760
I won't have that, John. There's none
of your hand-me-down Freudianism.

90
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,280
But the imagery is Christian, surely.

91
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,360
No, Harry. It's what it is.
Just itself.

92
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,840
It-lt's...
It's just magic.

93
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,600
Magic. Look.

94
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,280
Let me show you.
The child steps into the wardrobe.

95
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,000
The coats are thick and heavy.

96
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,840
- What about the fur?
- Fur's not important.

97
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,600
The child must push through.

98
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,360
They're pressing close,
almost suffocating.

99
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,360
And suddenly,
there's white light...

100
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,200
crisp, cold air...

101
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,360
trees, snow.

102
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,320
Total contrast, you see.

103
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,360
It's the gateway
to a magical world.

104
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,560
What time is it?

105
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,600
Good Lord, my train.

106
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,480
Anyway, well...

107
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,680
See you all tomorrow.
Bye.

108
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,840
- Cheerio, Jack. See you.
- Good-bye, Mr. Lewis.

109
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Yesterday, I received a letter...

110
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,800
that referred to an event
that took place...

111
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:07,280
almost a year ago now,
December 4, 1951.

112
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,240
My correspondent
hadn't forgotten.

113
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,960
I doubt if any of us have.

114
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,400
That was the night...

115
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,800
a Number 1 bus drove
into a column...

116
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,120
of young Royal Marine cadets
in Chatham...

117
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,320
and killed 24 of them.

118
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,600
You remember?

119
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,880
The letter asks...

120
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,320
some simple
but fundamental questions.

121
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,920
Where was God
on that December night?

122
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,880
Why didn't He stop it?

123
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,520
Isn't God
supposed to be good?

124
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,760
Isn't He supposed
to love us?

125
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,120
Does God
want us to suffer?

126
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,280
What if the answer
to that question is yes?

127
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,000
See, I'm not sure that God
particularly wants us to be happy.

128
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,480
I think He wants us to be able
to love and be loved.

129
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,200
He wants us to grow up.

130
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,120
I suggest to you
that it is because God loves us...

131
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,400
that He makes us
the gift of suffering.

132
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:09,760
To put it another way,
pain is God's megaphone...

133
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,240
to rouse a deaf world.

134
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,000
You see, we are like
blocks of stone...

135
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:20,880
out of which the sculptor
carves the forms of men.

136
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,920
The blows of His chisel,
which hurt us so much...

137
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,640
are what make us perfect.

138
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,960
Thank you very much.

139
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,360
A woman has had a dream
about me.

140
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:45,320
She writes to ask
if I've had a dream about her.

141
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,160
I had a strange dream
last night.

142
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,920
Another letter
from Mrs. Gresham.

143
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,320
- I can't remember any of it.
- Jewish Communist Christian American.

144
00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:00,040
You may ask me how I know
it was strange if I've forgotten it.

145
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,080
- Can't answer that one.
- I like her letters.

146
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,200
She can be quite sharp
sometimes.

147
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,320
Listen to this, Warnie.

148
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,720
She says, "I can't decide
whether you'd rather be...

149
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:14,800
the child caught in the spell,
or the magician casting it."

150
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,200
See, her letters are rather unusual.

151
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,480
She writes as if
she knows me somehow.

152
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:24,320
Still, I suppose there is something
of me in my books, isn't there?

153
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,680
I expect
it's just the American style.

154
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,760
Americans don't understand
about inhibitions.

155
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,720
Ah. She's coming to England.

156
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,360
She's coming to Oxford.
She wants to meet us.

157
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,880
- Well, she can't come here.
- She knows.

158
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:44,280
Of course not. But she does suggest
tea in her hotel.

159
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,440
Tea is safe.
A hotel is safe.

160
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,440
Though she might be mad.

161
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:53,080
No, I don't think so.
She does write poems.

162
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,240
Poems?

163
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,200
She'll be barking.

164
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:03,120
You won't be too agreeable,
will you, Jack?

165
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,040
Don't worry, Warnie.

166
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:23,360
She'll turn out to be writing
a dissertation on Wardrobe.

167
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:26,080
She'll ask if she can come watch you
while you create.

168
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,720
She'll say, "I'll sit in a corner.
You'll never know I'm there."

169
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,840
It's only tea, Warnie.

170
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,160
An hour or so of polite conversation,
then we go home...

171
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,600
and everything goes on
just the way it always has.

172
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:39,400
Shall we have some sandwiches?

173
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:42,000
I wonder if they do
toasted tea cakes.

174
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,920
Excuse me. I'm here to meet
Mr. C.S. Lewis, the writer.

175
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,960
Yes, madam.

176
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,640
- Well, do you know what he looks like?
- No, madam.

177
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,600
Well, he doesn't know
what I look like either.

178
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,200
Yes, madam.

179
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,120
Any ideas?

180
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,600
No, madam.

181
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,080
Anybody here called Lewis?

182
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,120
- Mrs. Gresham? How do you do?
- A pleasure.

183
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,040
- This is my brother, Warnie.
- Major Lewis.

184
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,200
Please, sit down.

185
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,600
So, you managed to find us.

186
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:39,400
Yes. I used the guide
and it was easy.

187
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:42,000
It's just that you don't look
at all like C.S. Lewis.

188
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:46,520
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you,
not to mention the rest of Oxford.

189
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,960
No, l...
So you don't like that.

190
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:59,120
Well, I'm not what you might call
a public figure, Mrs. Gresham.

191
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,480
Oh, you're not?
I mean...

192
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:04,160
You write all these books and you give
all those talks and everything...

193
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,840
just so everybody
will leave you alone?

194
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,320
Oh, dear.

195
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,120
We've only just met
and already you see right through me.

196
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,920
- Tell me, do you drink tea?
- Tea? Sure.

197
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:20,560
- It's England, right?
- So it is. Waiter?

198
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,720
Actually, look, l...

199
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:29,960
I'm a little in awe of you
and so I'm a little tense...

200
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,160
and when I get like that
I get kind of...

201
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,680
I don't know.

202
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,200
It's very childish.
I'm sure I'll get over it soon.

203
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,680
Not too soon, I hope,
please...

204
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,120
because I like
a good fight myself.

205
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,280
- You do?
- Yes.

206
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,600
You sound surprised.

207
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,920
That's great.
You like a good fight. Great.

208
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,680
But?

209
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,640
When's the last time
you lost?

210
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,000
- I've been at Morland since 1925.
- It's beautiful here.

211
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,360
How old is it?

212
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:07,480
The college was founded
very nearly 500 years ago.

213
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,440
Not all the buildings
are that old, of course.

214
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,760
My room is there.
That's the new building.

215
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,880
- New, huh?
- 1733.

216
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,840
What does your husband do,
Mrs. Gresham?

217
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,240
Oh, Bill?
Bill's a writer.

218
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:24,600
Oh. And you too,
Jack tells me.

219
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:28,760
- You call him Jack?
- I never liked the name Clive.

220
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,560
Oh, well, if you're a Jack...

221
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:36,040
- What?
- No, you look fine for a Jack.

222
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,440
Thank you.

223
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:41,080
Well, Jewish, but not Jewish-Jewish,
if you can follow that.

224
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:45,000
I mean, I'm a Christian, but I was
brought up to be a good atheist.

225
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,960
- An atheist?
- Don't sound so shocked.

226
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:51,200
I'm not.
I was an atheist once.

227
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:54,280
You? So we're both
lapsed atheists?

228
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:57,400
Yes, but I was never
a Communist.

229
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:00,320
- Why not?
- What do you mean, "why not"?

230
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:04,680
Well, I mean, back in '38 it seemed
to me there was only two choices...

231
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,040
either you were a fascist
and you conquered the world...

232
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:09,560
or you were a Communist
and you saved it.

233
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,520
Is that so?

234
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,960
I must have been otherwise engaged
at the time.

235
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,400
Oh, there's a world
worth saving.

236
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,880
At dawn on the first of May...

237
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:31,040
the choristers from the choir school
stand here and sing to the rising sun.

238
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,760
They said they draw
quite a crowd.

239
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,720
Hmm. What do they sing?

240
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,640
Can't say I've ever risen
early enough to hear them.

241
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,440
Oh, why not?
I mean, it sounds wonderful.

242
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,160
Well, I don't really go in
for seeing the sights.

243
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,000
Oh. So what do you do,
just walk around with your eyes shut?

244
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,240
You know, Mrs. Gresham...

245
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,440
I almost don't know
what to say to you.

246
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,480
Good Lord.

247
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,400
How long do you plan
to stay in England?

248
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,320
Till the end of December.

249
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,640
- Are you expected to be in Oxford again?
- I hadn't planned on it.

250
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:04,840
What do you say? Do you think we could
rise to a pot of homebrewed tea?

251
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,960
- I can manage that.
- Given early warning, of course.

252
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,360
Do you think
I could bring my son?

253
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,440
Douglas is such a big fan of your
Narnia books, he'd love to meet you.

254
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,280
- Yes, of course.
- I'll give you plenty of warning.

255
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:21,280
It was a pleasure meeting you.
Thanks for everything.

256
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,200
- Well, see you soon.
- Yes. Major.

257
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,560
Does one wait
for the train to leave?

258
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:36,080
I don't know.

259
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:40,200
Character and thought...
chicken and egg.

260
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,120
Which comes first?

261
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:49,160
Aristotle's solution
was simple and radical.

262
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:54,560
He said, "Plot is character.

263
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,560
Forget psychology.
Forget the inside of men's heads.

264
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,040
Judge them by their actions."

265
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,520
For example,
Mr. Whistler is asleep.

266
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:08,400
Now, from that action, I take it that he
has no interest in what I have to say.

267
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,800
The puzzle is, that being the case,
why is he here at all?

268
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:15,440
So, we construct a plot
from Mr. Whistler's actions.

269
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,200
He comes, he sleeps.

270
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:22,240
Now, Aristotle would say
that the next question is not why...

271
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,880
but what is Mr. Whistler
going to do next?

272
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,480
Good morning, Mr. Whistler.

273
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:37,560
My class is not compulsory,
neither are my chairs very comfortable.

274
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,680
- I suggest...
- All right. I'm going.

275
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,400
Thank you.

276
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,200
He comes, he sleeps,
he goes.

277
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,120
So the plot thickens.

278
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,920
It's all right, Warnie. She sails
back to New York after Christmas.

279
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,960
One can always be so much more friendly
to people who can't stay long.

280
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:20,040
I wonder what her husband thinks of her
gallivanting around England like this.

281
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:23,000
- It's not the Middle Ages, Warnie.
- She'll make you listen...

282
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,040
to one of her poems,
I'll bet you ten bob.

283
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,960
Then she'll say to you,
"How do you like it, Mr. Lewis?"

284
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,600
And you'll be stumped.

285
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:32,480
I shall say, "Mrs. Gresham,
only you could have written that."

286
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,440
Blast!

287
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,680
- That'll be one and nine pence, madam.
- Keep the change.

288
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,000
Hello. You must be Douglas.

289
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:54,440
- Are you him?
- No. I'm his brother.

290
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,000
So you found us.

291
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,240
- Well, the driver did.
- Come in.

292
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,480
Here we are.

293
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,360
There we are.

294
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,240
That's him.
Do go in.

295
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,360
Here you are, then.

296
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,360
- Hello.
- Good.

297
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,000
- Hello. Sorry. My hands are...
- We really appreciate this.

298
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:22,080
You've no idea how Douglas
was looking forward to today.

299
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,000
So you're Douglas.

300
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:29,720
Ask him. I told him you would write
in his Narnia book.

301
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:32,640
- Do you mind?
- No, of course not.

302
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,200
Yes.

303
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,360
Yes. "To Douglas," yes?

304
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,640
Douglas. Yes.

305
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,680
He wants to know if you have an attic.
You can ask him these things.

306
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,640
We do.

307
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,280
What does it say, honey?

308
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:03,760
- "The magic never ends."
- Well, if it does, sue him.

309
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,760
Thank you, Mrs. Young.
Thank you.

310
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,600
I'd sure like to see
the attic.

311
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,160
Then you shall.

312
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,080
Come along, young man.
Let's go and find it.

313
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,000
Thank you, Major Lewis.

314
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:23,320
Oh. Jack was particularly hoping
that you'd introduce him to your poetry.

315
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,800
Now I've got to find
the key.

316
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:33,840
Don't worry. I don't inflict my poems
on innocent strangers.

317
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,760
We're not strangers,
I hope.

318
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,080
What about some of that
long-promised tea?

319
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,040
Yes, please.

320
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:46,440
- You take milk, don't you?
- Yes.

321
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,080
No, I'd be interested
to know about your poems.

322
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,880
What do you want to know
about them?

323
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:56,800
How long they are?
Their rhyme schemes?

324
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:59,120
- Their major influences?
- Quite right, of course.

325
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,960
- Take sugar?
- Sure.

326
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,800
No, you're quite right.

327
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,760
Well, would you be so kind as to
introduce me to the poems themselves?

328
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,400
I'm not sure.

329
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,200
I won't be rude about them.

330
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:19,160
What will you do?
Stay silent or tell lies?

331
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,720
I shall choose
when I've heard one.

332
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:26,960
All right. I have won a national
poetry award shared with Robert Frost.

333
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,880
I'm impressed.

334
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:33,360
Well, let's hope you stay that way.
Let's get this out of the way.

335
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,840
I'll give you an early one.
That way I'm covered.

336
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:39,080
I wrote this when I was 22.
Spanish Civil War.

337
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,760
It's called "Snow in Madrid."

338
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,480
"Softly, so casual.

339
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:47,440
Lovely, so light, so light.

340
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:51,960
The cruel sky lets fall something
one does not fight.

341
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,640
Men, while perishing..."

342
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,080
Sorry.

343
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:02,920
"Men, before perishing
see with unwounded eye for once...

344
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,320
a gentle thing
fall from the sky."

345
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:11,040
- Oh, embarrassed, huh?
- No, I'm touched.

346
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,360
- Touched.
- Yes.

347
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:19,040
Touched... that's good.
That's about its level.

348
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,840
So you may ask when was I ever
in Madrid. The answer is never.

349
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,800
- Personal experience isn't everything.
- I disagree.

350
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,600
I think personal experience
is everything.

351
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,040
So reading is a waste of time?

352
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:36,400
No, it's not a waste of time,
but reading is safe, isn't it?

353
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,640
Books aren't about to hurt you.

354
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:43,160
- Why should one want to be hurt?
- That's when we learn.

355
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:47,200
Just because something hurts doesn't
make it more true or significant.

356
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,520
No, I guess not.

357
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,800
I'm not saying that pain is...

358
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:56,920
purposeless or even neutral,
but to find meaning in pain...

359
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,160
There has to be something else.

360
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,160
Pain is a tool.

361
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:04,360
- If you like, pain is God's...
- Megaphone to rouse a deaf world.

362
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,320
Oh, how embarrassing.

363
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,640
You know my writing too well,
don't you?

364
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,280
I have read most of it.

365
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,960
I guess I knew you pretty well
before we met.

366
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,760
But you'd not had
the personal experience.

367
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:26,120
Mr. Lewis, l...

368
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,360
I have to stop
calling you "Mr. Lewis."

369
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:32,560
It makes me feel like a kid.
Can I call you Jack?

370
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,680
Yes. Of course.

371
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,440
Jack, I'm Joy.

372
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,520
Well, hello, Joy.

373
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,040
So, Jack...

374
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,720
have you ever been really hurt?

375
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,040
You don't give up, do you?

376
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,960
Here we are.

377
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,440
Does anybody
ever come up here?

378
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,720
Not anymore.

379
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,960
Come in.

380
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:43,440
Here we are.
That's Warnie's desk.

381
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,440
This is mine.

382
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,640
It's not very orderly in here,
I'm afraid.

383
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,840
Well, you keep order
in your mind, right?

384
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,680
Yes.

385
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,760
Oh, that's nice.

386
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,680
Is it someplace real?

387
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:59,000
I think so. It's called
the Golden Valley, I believe.

388
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:02,040
- Somewhere in Herefordshire.
- Somewhere special?

389
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:06,040
In a way. It was on our nursery wall
when I was a child.

390
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:08,320
I didn't know
it was a real place then.

391
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:11,280
I thought it was a view
of heaven.

392
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,200
Oh, the promised land.

393
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:19,120
I used to think that one day
I'd come around a bend in the road...

394
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,760
or over the brow of a hill,
and there it would be.

395
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:33,000
I have been really hurt.
You know?

396
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:35,200
First time is always the worst.

397
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,600
That was when my mother died.

398
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:40,200
- How old were you?
- Nine.

399
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:43,200
- That's old enough to hurt.
- Oh, yes.

400
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:46,160
It was the end
of my world.

401
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,480
I remember my father in tears...

402
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:51,040
voices all over the house...

403
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,240
doors shutting and opening.

404
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:56,600
It was a big house,
all long, empty corridors.

405
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:00,040
I remember I had toothache,
and I wanted my mother to come to me.

406
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,400
I cried for her to come,
but she didn't come.

407
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:08,560
And after death,
did you believe you'd meet her again?

408
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,720
I don't think I had any faith
in anything when I was a child.

409
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,640
She was gone,
that was all.

410
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:20,760
And still you listen for the footsteps
coming down the corridors.

411
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,960
But they don't come.

412
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,400
Yes.

413
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,360
- You should see the garden before dark.
- Yes, I'd like that.

414
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,800
- You'll need a coat.
- I have one right here.

415
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:45,080
- There's a lake! A wood with a lake!
- Oh, good.

416
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:47,920
It's really a flooded clay pit
for the old brick works.

417
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,600
- He's all yours now.
- Be careful, Douglas.

418
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:54,200
The sun's well over the yardarm.

419
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,680
- Does he miss home?
- Oh, sure.

420
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,040
I mean, he'd like to be home
for Christmas...

421
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:04,840
but, well, it just hasn't
worked out that way.

422
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,800
What are you doing
for Christmas?

423
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,880
Some lucky English hotel,
I expect.

424
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,920
So your husband will have to look
after himself, is that it?

425
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,920
Yes. He's pretty good at that.

426
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:18,480
The lake is much older
than the house, of course.

427
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,760
They say Shelley used to sail
paper boats here.

428
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,960
Made out of early drafts
of his poems, no doubt.

429
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,600
I don't like to think of you
Christmassing in a hotel.

430
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,280
Why don't you come here?

431
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,280
You're very welcome.

432
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:40,160
You don't want a couple of yankees
rampaging all over your house.

433
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:43,360
I'd speak to Warnie,
of course, but...

434
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,800
Why don't we go inside.

435
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,360
Speaking for myself,
I'd welcome the company.

436
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:53,360
Somehow, Christmas makes more sense
when there are children around.

437
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:57,040
I suppose
we ought to get a tree.

438
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,000
What I really resent
is the presumption of good will.

439
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:01,640
I feel no good will toward
my fellow man whatever.

440
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:04,600
- I feel ill will.
- It'll be different this year...

441
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:08,080
More cheerful, I've no doubt.
A festive season.

442
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:11,920
I'm afraid Christmas, as I remember it,
is rather a lost cause.

443
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,120
- It's because we've lost the magic.
- No more blasted magic.

444
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:19,000
Well, you tell people it's about
taking care of the poor and needy...

445
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,960
and naturally
they don't even miss it.

446
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:23,240
The needy do come into it.

447
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:26,200
"No room at the inn," remember?
The mother and child?

448
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,680
Jack's invited them
to stay with us.

449
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,680
Who?

450
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:33,200
Mother and child.

451
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,600
Mrs. Gresham and her son...

452
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,560
They're spending Christmas
with us.

453
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:45,120
Well, Jack, you have succeeded
in surprising me.

454
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,440
Who is Mrs. Gresham?

455
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:50,720
Oh, she's just a friend,
an American.

456
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,960
A writer.

457
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:58,440
People do have guests
for Christmas, don't they?

458
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,000
Hello, Jack.
Happy Christmas.

459
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,440
Oxford.

460
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,960
This is Oxford station.

461
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,640
Nice talking to you.
Have a good trip and a merry Christmas.

462
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,600
- Merry Christmas.
- Same to you too.

463
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,840
- No, Mom.
- Are you sure it's not too heavy?

464
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:39,360
Mom, why did those people
sing so loud on the train?

465
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,960
- Hello.
- Oh, I didn't know you were...

466
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,880
Look who's here, Douglas.

467
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,640
- Did you have a good journey?
- Yeah.

468
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,920
- Welcome back to Oxford.
- Thanks.

469
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:56,600
- We're glad you could come.
- Yeah.

470
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,560
Come this way.

471
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,560
Douglas, here.

472
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,160
And Joy...

473
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,760
here.

474
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,240
And...

475
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,960
bathroom here.

476
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,880
- Well, that's that, then.
- It's good.

477
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:32,600
Good. We'll leave you
to settle in.

478
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,240
Great. Why don't you
come with me, Douglas.

479
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,720
What do you think next, Warnie?
A nice cup of tea?

480
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,200
Well, you can't go too far wrong
with a cup of tea.

481
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:46,280
- Joy?
- Oh, thank you.

482
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,200
By the way.
The college president is hosting...

483
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:50,120
his annual Christmas party
this evening...

484
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:53,240
and I'm afraid I'm more or less obliged
to put in an appearance.

485
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:55,200
I don't suppose you'd wish
to come with me, would you?

486
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,360
With Douglas?

487
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,080
- Douglas?
- Thanks.

488
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:07,320
Jack, that's all right. I could use
an early night. You go on without us.

489
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,280
Oh, that's a pity.
I thought you'd rather enjoy it.

490
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:13,440
We could always ask Mrs. Young.
We won't be so very late.

491
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,440
I'll be okay.

492
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,400
Now I'm being thoughtless.
You've only just arrived.

493
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,080
Do you have your hot-water bottle?

494
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:29,440
Here it is,
in its very dainty cover.

495
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,600
All right.
Keep it close to you.

496
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:34,480
Why do you think
they don't heat the house?

497
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,840
Uh, oh, I don't know.

498
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,720
It's such a strange country...

499
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,760
but I think the natives
are friendly.

500
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:45,080
So, you finish your chapter
and say your prayers?

501
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,320
You have a big,
big kiss on your cheek.

502
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,600
- Good night.
- Night.

503
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,080
- Good evening, Major Lewis.
- Good evening, Roberts.

504
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,040
- Mr. Lew...
- Evening, Roberts.

505
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:23,800
Good evening.

506
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:30,240
Come and meet
the college professors.

507
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:39,280
- Where on Earth did he find her?
- She wrote to him.

508
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,200
Ah. A pen pal.

509
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:44,560
Hello.

510
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:47,320
Is this your first trip
to England, Mrs. Gresham?

511
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:51,160
Oh, yeah. It's my first, but I was
wanting to come for a long time.

512
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,880
- What brings you to England?
- I'm working on a book...

513
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:56,320
so I was hoping to find
a publisher over here.

514
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,000
Christopher, there you are.

515
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,160
Yes, Jack, here I am.

516
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,440
Please let me introduce you
to Mrs. Joy Gresham.

517
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,800
- Professor Christopher Riley.
- Professor Riley.

518
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,400
- How do you do?
- Pleasure.

519
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:14,280
What success have you had...
with your book?

520
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,960
To be honest,
it's not ready to be seen yet.

521
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,320
You mustn't let that stop you,
Mrs. Gresham.

522
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,280
It doesn't stop Jack.

523
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,560
I'm sorry?

524
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,800
I am right in assuming you're
from the United States of America?

525
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:28,120
- Yes, I am.
- Perhaps you can satisfy...

526
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,880
my curiosity on a related matter.

527
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:33,280
I had always understood Americans
to be hard-riding, tough-talking...

528
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,800
no-nonsense sort of people,
yet Jack tells me...

529
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,600
his children's stories
sell very well there.

530
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:42,320
- Who can be buying them?
- Well, Professor Riley...

531
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,800
we're not all cowboys.

532
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:47,040
Have you read
any of Jack's children's books?

533
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:50,120
Jack has read extracts
aloud to me.

534
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,480
It is one of his
tests of friendship.

535
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,640
I think they're rather magical.

536
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,240
Congratulations, Jack.
You seem to have found a soul mate.

537
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,080
I thought you believed
we didn't have souls, Christopher.

538
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:05,960
Well, yes. Now, I regard the soul
as an essentially feminine accessory...

539
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:09,760
anima quite different from animus,
the male variant.

540
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:14,040
This is how I explain the otherwise
puzzling difference between the sexes.

541
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:16,520
Where men have intellect...

542
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:19,120
women have soul.

543
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,760
As you say, Professor Riley...

544
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,320
uh, I'm from the United States...

545
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,000
and different cultures
have different modes of discourse.

546
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:29,560
I need a little guidance. Are you trying
to be offensive, or just merely stupid?

547
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,280
Let me introduce you
to some friends of mine.

548
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,800
Excuse me.
I'm sorry.

549
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,400
Hello.

550
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,080
It stood in our nursery
when we were children.

551
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:18,320
If you don't need it anymore
you should throw it away.

552
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,680
I'm not very good at throwing
things away, as you can see.

553
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,640
We don't have an attic
at home.

554
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,560
You wish you were at home,
don't you?

555
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:32,080
We always have a turkey
for Christmas at home.

556
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,840
Well, we'll have turkey here too.

557
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,440
With cranberry sauce?

558
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:39,840
- Ah.
- My dad loves cranberry sauce.

559
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,880
Does he?

560
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,160
And snow.

561
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:48,680
Who do you look like most, Douglas,
your mother or your father?

562
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,800
This is my mom...

563
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,760
and this is my dad.

564
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,960
But my dad's kind of noisy...

565
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,560
and I'm not.

566
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,800
Noisy in which way?

567
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:07,320
Like shouting.
I hate shouting.

568
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,680
Yeah, me too.

569
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:15,080
I knew it was
just a little wardrobe.

570
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,720
Mrs. Young...

571
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:28,080
we wouldn't happen to have
any cranberry sauce, would we?

572
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:31,280
Cranberry sauce?
What's that?

573
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:35,760
Well, my guess is it's a sauce,
made from cranberries.

574
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:40,880
Well, Mr. Lewis, if you can find me
some cranberries, I'll sauce 'em.

575
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,480
Well, I think Mrs. Young
has done us proud, Warnie.

576
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,680
Happy Christmas.

577
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,160
Want to raise a glass
to your husband, Joy?

578
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:02,440
- Sure. Here's to Bill.
- To Bill.

579
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,960
Can we telephone to America?

580
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,880
- Yes, I believe so. Do you want to?
- That's all right.

581
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:10,960
- We'll be home before long.
- You're very welcome, if you want.

582
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:14,440
- I do want.
- It's very expensive, Douglas.

583
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:17,760
- Oh, come on. I don't mind.
- He's excited by the novelty of it.

584
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,960
I am not.
I want to talk to Dad.

585
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,800
Well, you can't,
and that's that.

586
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,160
Beastly things, telephones.
Ring, ring, ring.

587
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,680
Stop what you're doing, get up,
hurry, hurry.

588
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,440
Ring, ring, ring.

589
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,120
No manners at all.

590
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,760
- All well?
- All well.

591
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:50,880
Douglas never makes a fuss
about going to bed.

592
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,720
It appears he never makes a fuss
about anything...

593
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,360
except telephones, perhaps.

594
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,440
Right. May I?

595
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,440
Yes, of course.

596
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:03,720
Warnie's taken himself
off to bed too.

597
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:06,040
Sometimes he overdoes it
a little.

598
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:08,320
- I expect you noticed.
- Yes.

599
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:12,360
- I know the signs.
- Oh, there are signs?

600
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,920
Good old Warnie.

601
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,560
You know, don't you?

602
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,120
Know what?

603
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,960
Well, you must not think
I'm much of a mother...

604
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:34,520
not letting her son call his father
on Christmas day.

605
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,560
Oh, that.
Well, it's none of my...

606
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:40,000
It just doesn't...
It's not...

607
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,920
It isn't what it looks like.

608
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,720
- I see.
- Thank you for not asking.

609
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,960
Not asking what?

610
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,480
What's this woman doing, chasing
all over England without her husband?

611
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:54,200
Ah, that.

612
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,440
I-I ran away.

613
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,680
It's always a mistake,
isn't it?

614
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:05,080
I mean, you have to face things
in the end.

615
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:12,840
I left home because Bill fell in love
with another woman.

616
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,680
He takes the romantic view...

617
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,720
If you love someone, you marry them.
I'm number two.

618
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,800
He wants me to give him a divorce
so he can marry number three.

619
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:27,640
I see.

620
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,320
Bill's an alcoholic.

621
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,280
He's compulsively unfaithful.

622
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:41,560
And he's sometimes violent, and I guess
I haven't loved him for years.

623
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,800
- He's violent?
- Only when he's drunk...

624
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:49,560
and he doesn't really know
what he's doing.

625
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:51,520
It's just that he's worn me out.

626
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,440
That's the truth of it.

627
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:57,200
Joy, look,
if there's anything I can do...

628
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:02,200
There is.

629
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:05,080
You can be my friend.

630
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:08,600
I hope I'm that already.

631
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,400
In you get, young man.

632
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:18,920
- I'll take that for you, sir.
- Well, good-bye, Warnie.

633
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,080
- Thanks for putting up with us.
- Not at all.

634
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:23,480
We shall miss you.

635
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:32,160
Good-bye, Joy.

636
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:53,480
So they sail back tomorrow?

637
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:55,400
Yes.

638
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:02,520
I'm not sure that God
particularly wants us to be happy.

639
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:04,760
I think He wants us
to be able to love...

640
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:06,720
and be loved.

641
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,640
Wants us to grow up.

642
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:13,280
We think our childish toys...

643
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,840
bring us all the happiness
there is...

644
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:19,720
and our nursery
is the whole wide world.

645
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:24,960
But something must drive us
out of the nursery...

646
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:27,840
to the world of others...

647
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:30,800
and that something is suffering.

648
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:54,520
You miss her, don't you?

649
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:59,480
Well, things are quieter now,
aren't they?

650
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:03,440
Yeah. I'm not much
of a talker.

651
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:06,800
One of your many virtues,
Warnie.

652
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:09,240
- She coming back?
- No.

653
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:22,560
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

654
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:24,760
- Ah. What's your name?
- James, sir.

655
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:30,840
- Here you are, James.
- Thank you, sir.

656
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:36,280
- Would you sign that for me, please?
- Yes.

657
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:42,600
Thank you.

658
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:52,200
I've always found this
a trying time of the year.

659
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:54,960
Trying?
To do what, Jack?

660
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:01,200
The leaves not yet out,
mud everywhere you go.

661
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:03,720
Frosty mornings gone.

662
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:05,640
Sunny mornings not yet come.

663
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:11,200
Give me blizzards and frozen pipes,
but not this nothing time.

664
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:16,000
Not this
waiting room of the world.

665
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:23,960
Tell me something, Christopher.
How shall I put this?

666
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:27,920
Would you say
you were content?

667
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,600
I am as I am.

668
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:32,560
The world is as it is.

669
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:37,400
My contentment or otherwise
has very little to do with it.

670
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:42,280
Don't you ever feel
a sense of waste?

671
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,840
Of course.

672
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:51,440
Good evening.

673
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:11,680
I hope you don't mind.

674
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,920
May I come in?

675
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,840
Yeah.

676
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:29,720
I happened to be in Blackwell's
the other day...

677
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:31,920
and I saw you borrow a book.

678
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:36,240
No, steal. I stole it.
Most of these books are stolen.

679
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:38,120
They're written to be read.
At least I read them...

680
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:40,560
which is more
than most people do.

681
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:45,320
So you read differently
to the rest of us, do you?

682
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:47,760
Yes, I do.

683
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:49,760
I read at night.

684
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:52,760
It's the only thing breaks me
concentration. All night sometimes.

685
00:47:55,760 --> 00:48:00,000
When I start a new book
my hands are shaking.

686
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:02,920
My eyes are jumping ahead...
Does he feel the way I felt?

687
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:06,360
Does he see
what I've seen?

688
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:11,000
You know, my father used to say...
He was a teacher like you.

689
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:13,040
Well, not like you.

690
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:15,280
He was only
the village schoolmaster.

691
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:20,760
What was it your father
used to say?

692
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:26,880
"We read to know
we're not alone."

693
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:33,880
Would it help
if I made you a small loan?

694
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:37,240
Yes, I expect it would,
if I wanted to be helped.

695
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:40,280
I see. Good-bye.

696
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:48,160
You see, we are like
blocks of stone...

697
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:52,000
out of which the sculptor
carves the forms of men.

698
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:56,360
The blows of His chisel,
which hurt us so much...

699
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:58,280
are what make us perfect.

700
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:02,520
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

701
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:08,280
Mr. Lewis, what can I say?

702
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:16,560
Mr. Lewis,
I didn't want to bother you.

703
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:18,520
Congratulations.

704
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:21,240
- Wonderful piece.
- Mr. Lewis, I'm from Ohio.

705
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:23,160
Ohio? Oh, yes. How nice.

706
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:26,520
I'll go on ahead.
You'll join us, won't you?

707
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:28,000
Yes. Do. Thank you.

708
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:41,440
Marvelous speech.
Thank you.

709
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:44,000
Hello, Jack.

710
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:48,360
- What are you doing here?
- I came to hear your talk.

711
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:50,880
- Oh, yes, but...
- What am I doing in London?

712
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:52,760
Well, Douglas and I
live here now.

713
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:55,640
- Really?
- What did I do with Bill?

714
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:59,960
We're divorced, but it's going
to work out better for all of us.

715
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,200
Yes.
Why didn't you write?

716
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:06,680
What for?
To ask permission?

717
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:09,400
- No.
- Do you mind?

718
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:11,280
Me? No.
Why should I mind?

719
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:13,880
Oh. So it's all
all right then?

720
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:15,800
Yes.

721
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:17,920
But, um...

722
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,560
I really am very, very surprised
to see you here, you know.

723
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:24,600
Well, I wasn't dead.
I was just in America.

724
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:25,840
Of course. Yes.

725
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:31,160
Yes, but, um, you see, l...

726
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:34,400
I've been thinking about you.
Yes. I've been thinking about you.

727
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:36,600
- Can I be of any assistance?
- No, it's all right.

728
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:38,520
I'm just talking
to my friend.

729
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:42,320
Yes, I was...

730
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:46,320
I was thinking about you,
and suddenly there you were.

731
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:49,520
No, here I am.
It's present tense.

732
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:51,600
- Present and tense.
- I'm very sorry...

733
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:54,360
but the committee is waiting
to entertain Mr. Lewis.

734
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:57,160
It's all right.
I'll be with you in a moment.

735
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:01,440
So. Do let me know
where you are.

736
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:06,000
Sure.

737
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:08,360
Good. Bye.

738
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:15,480
I do hope
I did the right thing.

739
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:18,480
We're just in here.

740
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:28,800
So, she's settled here
for good, has she?

741
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:31,480
For the foreseeable future.

742
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:33,960
- With the boy?
- Yes.

743
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:36,560
Will you be seeing
much of her?

744
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:43,680
Not much, I shouldn't think. I may
look in again when I'm next in London.

745
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:04,320
It's very sweet of you
to come and see me again, Jack.

746
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:07,120
- I know how busy you are.
- No, not at all.

747
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:09,560
I look forward
to my outings to London.

748
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:11,560
You must come and visit us
in Oxford.

749
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:14,520
- Would you like some sherry?
- Oh, yes.

750
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:17,480
Yes. Maybe as soon
as Douglas's school term ends.

751
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:21,680
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

752
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:25,720
I would like
to see Warnie again.

753
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:28,400
You can just move Douglas's puzzle
out of the way.

754
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:31,280
- All right.
- Do remember me to Warnie.

755
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:34,120
Tell him I promise
I won't turn into a nuisance.

756
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:37,000
Why should you
turn into a nuisance?

757
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:39,600
Well, Jack,
I don't have to explain.

758
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:41,520
Explain what?

759
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:45,320
- And why did you look at me like that?
- Like what?

760
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:48,120
As if I'm lying to you.
I mean what I say.

761
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:52,400
No, I know. It's just that
you don't say it all, do you?

762
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:54,680
Well, one can't say it all.
It would take too long.

763
00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:00,280
- Did you finish your chapter?
- Almost.

764
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:04,920
- Not yet.
- All right. Just a little bit longer.

765
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:07,960
- Just till your hair dries.
- Okay. Night, Jack.

766
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:10,520
- Good night, Douglas.
- Wait. I want a kiss.

767
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:16,720
- Night, night.
- Good night, Mom.

768
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:19,160
Sweet dreams.

769
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:21,160
I'm gonna check
the supper.

770
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:34,880
What sort of things
do you want me to say?

771
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:37,480
Well, Jack, I want to remain
friends with you...

772
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:41,080
so I need to know if there's anything
that makes that hard for you.

773
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:42,960
Oh, I see.

774
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:45,640
We might as well know
where we are.

775
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:49,720
Never can really tell what's going on
between people, can you?

776
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:51,720
People jump to conclusions.

777
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:53,520
Sometimes it makes me quite angry,
the way people...

778
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:56,400
aren't allowed to be,
you know, just friends.

779
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:57,880
Like us, you mean.

780
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:01,920
Like us. I don't mean to say
that friendship is a small thing.

781
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,520
As a matter of fact, I rate it as
one of life's most precious gifts.

782
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:06,840
But?

783
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:09,920
But it shouldn't be turned into
a watered-down version...

784
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,560
of something it is not.

785
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:15,080
- Such as?
- Such as...

786
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:19,000
Well, to give you one example,
romantic love.

787
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:21,200
That's not to say
that friendship isn't, in its way...

788
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:23,160
A kind of love.

789
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:27,000
- See? I knew you'd understand.
- I understand more than that.

790
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:29,640
- Could you open this?
- Yeah.

791
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:34,320
You're a bachelor
and I'm a divorced woman.

792
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:38,640
Some people would imagine that you have
romantic intentions towards me.

793
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:42,040
You have no such intentions,
and you want that out in the open...

794
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:44,960
because you care about me
and you don't want me to be hurt.

795
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,400
Have I understood you correctly?

796
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:51,000
- I don't know what to say.
- You don't have to say anything.

797
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:53,720
I just said it.
Wasn't so hard, was it?

798
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:56,600
I'm just not used to this...
whatever it is.

799
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:58,920
Naming names, that's all.

800
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,080
Yes.

801
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:04,280
Now you don't have to be
afraid of me anymore, do you?

802
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:06,680
Good Lord. I was never
afraid of you.

803
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:11,240
Why are you looking...
I was never afraid of you.

804
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:14,960
Jack...

805
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:19,400
I really am very thankful
for everything you've done for me.

806
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:25,960
I'm sure there are more
substantial ways I could be of help...

807
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:27,880
that you're
not telling me about.

808
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:30,240
I don't want to exhaust
your good will.

809
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:32,200
There's no fear of that.

810
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:37,280
There is something
which would help me enormously.

811
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:40,160
I find it...
Oh, Jack.

812
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:42,840
This is very hard for me.

813
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:45,640
If it's too much for you,
you would just say no, wouldn't you?

814
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:49,960
Just no. I mean, no guilt,
evasion, no running away.

815
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:54,640
Yes, I think I could
just about manage that.

816
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:17,240
Something I ought
to tell you, Warnie.

817
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:20,840
- Mm-hmm?
- Yeah.

818
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:22,760
Um...

819
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:28,320
I've agreed to marry Joy.

820
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:37,720
- You have?
- Mm-hmm.

821
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:40,120
Seemed the right thing to do.

822
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:43,320
It did?

823
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:46,000
Yes. There's nothing
to worry about.

824
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:49,960
See, what I've agreed to do is extend
my British citizenship to her...

825
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:52,480
so that she can go on
living in England.

826
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:55,480
- By marrying her?
- Yeah. Only technically.

827
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:59,640
You're marrying Joy technically?

828
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:02,120
Hmm. Well, a true marriage...

829
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:06,400
is a declaration before God,
not before some government official.

830
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:10,760
Joy will keep her own name, and we'll
all go on living exactly as before.

831
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:15,240
Before you are joined
in matrimony...

832
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:18,880
I have to remind you of the solemn
and binding character...

833
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:21,840
of the vows
you are about to make.

834
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:25,080
Now, Mr. Lewis,
you'll repeat after me.

835
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:27,320
"I call upon these persons
here present...

836
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:32,520
to witness that I,
Clive Staples Lewis...

837
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:37,400
do take thee,
Helen Joy Gresham...

838
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:41,200
to be my lawful wedded wife."

839
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:46,120
Joy Gresham,
if you'll repeat after me.

840
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:48,400
"I call upon these persons
here present...

841
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:53,080
to witness that I,
Helen Joy Gresham...

842
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:57,880
do take thee,
Clive Staples Lewis...

843
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:02,200
to be my lawful wedded husband."

844
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:07,160
Do we have a ring?

845
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:08,640
- No.
- No.

846
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:16,320
- Well, that's that.
- Can I buy you both a drink?

847
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:19,320
Sorry, Joy. I simply
have to catch the 12:22.

848
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:21,560
- Well, then off you go, Jack.
- Bye, Warnie.

849
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:23,480
- Bye, Jack.
- Bye, Joy.

850
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:28,280
I'll be most grateful
for that drink, Joy.

851
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:30,200
That's awfully kind
of you, Warnie.

852
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:32,560
I think I saw a pub just down the road.
Shall we risk it?

853
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:35,160
All right.

854
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:37,080
- Go.
- Here we go.

855
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:39,000
Dear heaven.

856
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:46,880
Well, that was quite
an unusual experience.

857
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:49,600
Yes. You must forgive Jack.

858
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:53,800
Oh, I'm getting to know him
a little by now.

859
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:55,760
I think
I understand him better.

860
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:57,840
Anyway, I'm very grateful
to him.

861
00:58:57,920 --> 00:58:59,800
Nobody's to know,
he tells me.

862
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:04,560
Well, actually, what he said was,
it will be as if it never happened.

863
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:10,320
A great mistake, Jack.
You'll live to regret it.

864
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:12,240
Regret what, Chris?

865
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:14,920
Staying in this godforsaken place
all summer.

866
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:18,040
- Day after Encaenia, I'm off.
- Where, Chris?

867
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:20,800
- Tuscany. Where else?
- Where else indeed.

868
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:23,360
- Have some cheese.
- We're going to the Loire...

869
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:25,320
camping.

870
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:27,160
Camping?

871
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:29,840
- Think I'll bring a guest this year.
- Do, by all means.

872
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:32,960
When Laura was alive, we once
took the grandchildren camping.

873
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:35,360
- Bring a guest, Jack?
- Yes.

874
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:37,600
- Encaenia.
- Take my tip.

875
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:41,120
Sleep outside the tent
and smoke a cigar.

876
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:42,800
- Whatever for?
- Mosquitoes.

877
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:45,800
You've met her.
Joy Gresham.

878
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:48,560
- Yes, of course.
- Not the American.

879
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:52,720
- Yes. The American.
- Is she back in Oxford?

880
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:54,720
Thank you.
No, no.

881
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:56,920
No, she's in London.

882
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,400
She wants to see the pageant
of learning.

883
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:22,880
I feel distinctly under dressed.

884
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:25,720
This is just
a sort of uniform, really.

885
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:28,680
Jack's party frock.

886
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:33,520
Jack, come here.

887
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:36,720
- Come here.
- What?
