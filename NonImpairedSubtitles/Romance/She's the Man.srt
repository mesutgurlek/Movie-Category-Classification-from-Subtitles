1
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:37,388
She shoots, she scores! Goal!

2
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:39,719
- What? That's right! Give it!
- Nice kick.

3
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:41,793
- Very nice kick.
- Give me the ball!

4
00:02:41,928 --> 00:02:43,623
Justin!

5
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:47,563
- Drop... Put me down!
- OK. Down like...

6
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:48,894
Oh, sorry.

7
00:02:49,035 --> 00:02:50,662
- Goodness.
- Hey!

8
00:02:50,803 --> 00:02:52,134
Hi.

9
00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:59,510
- OK, you are really getting good.
- You too.

10
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:03,082
I mean, when we first started going out,
you couldn't kiss at all.

11
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:06,185
- I meant at soccer.
- Really?

12
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,344
Absolutely. You're...

13
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:11,582
...probably already better
than half the guys on my team.

14
00:03:11,724 --> 00:03:14,192
Probably more than half.

15
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:20,259
What do you mean,
I couldn't kiss at all?

16
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,392
Don't worry. I've taught you well.

17
00:03:27,473 --> 00:03:30,033
I know.

18
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:32,007
OK, but seriously, don't you think

19
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:34,909
you'd get more playing time
at a school like Michigan?

20
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:38,108
Maybe, but it's always been
about being a Tar Heel for me.

21
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:40,219
I'm gonna wear that Carolina blue.

22
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:42,719
- Yeah.
- Yeah, baby!

23
00:03:42,855 --> 00:03:45,323
OK, what is the lacrosse team
doing on our field?

24
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:47,483
- The school cut our team.
- Wait, what?

25
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:50,187
- Not enough girls signed up.
- So they just cut us?

26
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:52,423
They can't do that.

27
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:57,128
OK. This is not over.

28
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,673
Hi, girls. I heard the bad news.

29
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:07,006
"Bad"? It's a disaster.

30
00:04:07,146 --> 00:04:10,172
Now college scouts
won't even get to see us play.

31
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:13,683
I know. If there's anything I can do,
just say the word.

32
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,914
Matter of fact, there is.
We wanna try out for the boys team.

33
00:04:19,158 --> 00:04:20,591
Anything besides that.

34
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:23,195
Coach, come on!
You know that we're good enough.

35
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:26,924
I don't know that
that's a thing that I know.

36
00:04:27,066 --> 00:04:28,124
What?

37
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,997
All we're asking for is one shot.

38
00:04:30,136 --> 00:04:32,036
- Yeah.
- Girls,

39
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:34,537
we have two weeks before school starts.

40
00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:39,304
Then we open against Illyria.
A rivalry game. We have to win.

41
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:40,969
And we can help you win.

42
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:43,480
- Hey, baby.
- Hey.

43
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:45,015
What's going on, coach?

44
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:49,486
The girls here want
to try out for the team.

45
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,452
- You're not serious.
- All right, all right!

46
00:04:53,593 --> 00:04:55,788
You're all excellent players.

47
00:04:55,928 --> 00:04:58,795
- But girls aren't as fast as boys.
- Right.

48
00:04:58,931 --> 00:05:01,422
- What?
- Or as strong. Or as athletic.

49
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:06,572
This is not me talking.
It's a scientific fact.

50
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:10,233
Girls can't beat boys.
It's as simple as that.

51
00:05:10,376 --> 00:05:13,709
OK. Justin, you're the team captain.
What do you think about it?

52
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:17,245
I think the coach said it all.

53
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:21,080
Yesterday you told me that I was better
than half the guys on your team.

54
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,585
What?

55
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:25,516
I never said that.

56
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:28,456
What are you talking about?
Why are you lying?!

57
00:05:28,594 --> 00:05:31,085
Viola! End of discussion.

58
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,720
Yeah, tell her, man.

59
00:05:32,865 --> 00:05:35,561
Fine. End of relationship.

60
00:05:37,737 --> 00:05:40,604
- Come on, let's go.
- Baby, don't be like that. I...

61
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:44,208
I just don't want to see you get hurt.

62
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:45,641
You are so full of...

63
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:47,670
Back to practice.

64
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,880
Sebastian.

65
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:03,057
Sebastian?!

66
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:05,823
Sebastian! Jeez!

67
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:10,894
It's you.

68
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:14,200
God, you and your brother
look scary alike from the back.

69
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,433
I think it's your total lack of curves.

70
00:06:17,643 --> 00:06:19,804
Hi, Monique.
It's so good to see you too.

71
00:06:19,946 --> 00:06:22,176
I'm looking for Sebastian. Where is he?

72
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:23,646
I don't know.

73
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:26,775
Just remind your brother
how lucky he is to be in my life.

74
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:30,150
And tell him to give me a call
if he wants to stay in it. OK?

75
00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:34,055
OK. Does he have your number?
1-800-BEYOTCH?

76
00:06:37,997 --> 00:06:40,022
She will do great things.

77
00:06:43,803 --> 00:06:46,931
I have a surprise for you!

78
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,405
And this is why
I don't bring friends over.

79
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:51,874
Mom, not now.
I had a really bad day, so...

80
00:06:52,011 --> 00:06:54,104
This is just the thing
to just perk you up.

81
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:55,271
- Hold on.
- OK.

82
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:56,609
Keep your eyes closed.

83
00:06:56,749 --> 00:07:00,344
- Eyes closed, closed, closed, closed.
- They're closed.

84
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:02,716
All right. Surprise!

85
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:08,321
Beautiful gowns
for my darling debutante.

86
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:10,622
Mom, have I not
told you a thousand times?

87
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:14,722
I have no interest in being a debutante.
It's totally archaic.

88
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:16,732
How could I wind up with a daughter

89
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:20,236
who only wants to kick
a muddy ball around a field all day?

90
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:23,740
Well, the world has been set right, Mom.
They cut my team.

91
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:27,243
- What? No soccer?
- Yeah, that's right. No soccer.

92
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:30,042
- How sad.
- Yeah, I can see you're all torn up.

93
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:33,641
Well, Justin's gonna love you in this.

94
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:36,346
Yet another reason not to wear it.
I dumped him.

95
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:40,050
- What? Why?
- I don't wanna talk about it.

96
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:43,026
He's so handsome and rugged

97
00:07:43,162 --> 00:07:46,097
and chiseled and great.

98
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:48,666
Then why don't you date him, Mom?

99
00:07:50,837 --> 00:07:53,499
No, I couldn't.

100
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:54,867
- Hey, Sebastian.
- Hey.

101
00:07:55,007 --> 00:07:56,531
You OK?

102
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:58,974
Monique was looking for you.

103
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:01,647
Why do you even date her, anyway?

104
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:04,409
She's hot. It's a guy thing.

105
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,916
But she's so awful.

106
00:08:09,188 --> 00:08:11,782
Hey, you know,
you could use the front door.

107
00:08:11,924 --> 00:08:13,551
And Mom can't see me.

108
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:16,594
She thinks I'm staying at Dad's.
Dad thinks I'm at Mom's.

109
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:19,357
In two days they both think
I'm going away to school.

110
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:22,696
- That is the beauty of divorce.
- Where are you going?

111
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:24,393
London for a couple of weeks.

112
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:26,266
As in London, England?

113
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:28,965
Yeah, my band got a slot
in a music festival there.

114
00:08:29,108 --> 00:08:31,576
OK, what are you gonna do about school?

115
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:35,238
Yeah, I was kind of hoping
you could help me with that.

116
00:08:35,381 --> 00:08:39,613
Could you just, like, pretend to be Mom,
call Illyria, tell them I'm sick?

117
00:08:39,752 --> 00:08:43,244
Something that sounds like it
would last for two weeks, like mad cow.

118
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:46,950
Sebastian, you just got kicked out
of Cornwall for skipping.

119
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:49,561
This is not exactly the way
you want to start out.

120
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:50,855
I want to be a musician.

121
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:53,898
Last time I heard,
they don't need to know trigonometry.

122
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:56,194
Besides,
if you want to chase your dreams,

123
00:08:56,335 --> 00:08:58,769
sometimes you gotta
break the rules, right?

124
00:08:58,905 --> 00:09:01,965
You know the percentage of bands
that make it to the big time?

125
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:04,508
Probably the same
as female soccer players.

126
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:07,477
I will see you in two weeks.

127
00:09:07,613 --> 00:09:08,978
Sebastian.

128
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:12,516
- Sebastian!
- Were you talking with your brother?

129
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:14,552
No. Yes.

130
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:18,714
On the phone. He's at Dad's. Bye, Dad.

131
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:20,291
Picture this:

132
00:09:20,426 --> 00:09:22,053
We're at the country club,

133
00:09:22,194 --> 00:09:25,925
they call your name,
and you emerge in this.

134
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:33,463
No. Sorry, Mom.
I have a strict no-ruffles policy.

135
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:38,703
Sometimes I just think you
just might as well be your brother.

136
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:45,247
You know what?

137
00:09:45,384 --> 00:09:48,945
If you can't join them, beat them.

138
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:53,283
You want me
to turn you into your brother?

139
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,951
That's right.
I'm going to Illyria as Sebastian.

140
00:09:56,095 --> 00:10:00,657
I'll make the boys soccer team, and in
12 days beat the Cornwall boys team.

141
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,166
You've taken too many
soccer balls to the head.

142
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:05,133
You know I can do it, Paul.

143
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:09,207
<i>Except for the voice, mannerisms,
the breasts, the mentality and...</i>

144
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:12,470
It doesn't matter. Nobody at Illyria
has even met Sebastian.

145
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:15,547
- They won't know the difference.
- They'll know he's a girl.

146
00:10:15,681 --> 00:10:18,650
- Oh, come on, Paul.
- Yeah, come on, Paul.

147
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:20,547
Yeah, come on, Paul.

148
00:10:23,422 --> 00:10:26,550
OK. OK. I'll see what I can do.

149
00:10:26,692 --> 00:10:28,683
Yes!

150
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:26,448
Where are you going?

151
00:11:26,585 --> 00:11:29,713
Mom, I told you!
I'm going to Dad's house for two weeks.

152
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:31,720
No, you didn't. And you're not going.

153
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:34,417
We've hardly spent
any time together this summer.

154
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,959
Now go upstairs and unpack.

155
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:38,461
OK, Mom, I thought about what you said.

156
00:11:38,597 --> 00:11:42,658
<i>And you know Monique is gonna
be there 24l7 with Sebastian,</i>

157
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:44,895
so, I don't know, I was just thinking

158
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:48,473
that maybe she'd show me the ropes
on the whole debutante thing.

159
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:51,633
- This is so exciting!
- Isn't it?!

160
00:11:51,777 --> 00:11:53,335
You're gonna have so much fun.

161
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:55,640
There's the formal ball.
And the luncheon.

162
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:58,249
And, oh, did I mention
the fundraiser next week?

163
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,579
It's gonna be a carnival!

164
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,187
Look out!

165
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:05,916
Your brother promised to be there,
so remind him when you see him.

166
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:10,017
Oh, my little girl.
You're finally gonna be a lady!

167
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:36,213
Are you sure I can do this?!

168
00:12:36,355 --> 00:12:38,118
Oh, yeah. Absolutely.

169
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:43,918
What's up?

170
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:46,325
Oh, my God, he knew!

171
00:12:46,465 --> 00:12:49,127
- I wanna go home!
- Relax. He was being friendly!

172
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:52,328
We're not going home! Stop it!
I did not spend all this time...

173
00:12:52,471 --> 00:12:55,099
- It's your fault! Drive home!
- My idea?! You asked me!

174
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:57,141
- I did your hair and makeup!
- Reverse!

175
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:59,574
- I want to go!
- You're being a girl!

176
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:01,577
- We're not going.
- Come on! Drive!

177
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:03,579
- He was being friendly.
- All right!

178
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:05,479
Let's run through it one more time.

179
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:07,449
Let me hear the voice.

180
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:12,487
Hey. What's up? I'm Sebastian.

181
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,115
OK. Now show me the strut.

182
00:13:19,064 --> 00:13:20,292
Now, hawk a loogie.

183
00:13:22,868 --> 00:13:24,426
I'm so proud!

184
00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:27,498
- Get off me!
- Remember,

185
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,870
inside every girl there's a boy.

186
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:32,307
That came out wrong.
But you know what I mean.

187
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:35,680
Vi.

188
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:40,376
Be a good boy.

189
00:14:18,824 --> 00:14:20,348
See you guys.

190
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:24,190
I can do this. I am a dude!

191
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:29,165
I am a hunky dude!
I'm a badass hunky dude!

192
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:11,473
Hey! Hey! What up?

193
00:15:14,213 --> 00:15:15,805
You must be my roommates.

194
00:15:19,952 --> 00:15:21,317
What's your name?

195
00:15:21,453 --> 00:15:24,911
- Sebastian Hastings.
- Duke Orsino.

196
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:27,956
OK.

197
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:30,425
OK, OK, OK.

198
00:15:30,562 --> 00:15:32,757
This is Andrew and Toby.
They live next door.

199
00:15:32,898 --> 00:15:35,867
Yeah. Freshman dorm's
that-a-way, twiglet.

200
00:15:36,001 --> 00:15:37,366
Seriously, how old are you?

201
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:40,097
I skipped a couple grades.

202
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:41,968
I'm brilliant.

203
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:52,411
Anyway, do you know
when soccer tryouts start?

204
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:54,109
Noon. You play?

205
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:58,383
Absolutely. Center forward.
You know it, bro.

206
00:15:58,524 --> 00:16:01,049
So you play the beautiful game... bro?

207
00:16:01,193 --> 00:16:03,491
Brothers? Brethren?

208
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:07,030
Yeah, I'm a striker.
Andrew and Toby are halfbacks.

209
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:08,497
Schveet.

210
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:12,603
OK, why do you have tampons
in your boot?

211
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:22,442
I get really bad nose bleeds.

212
00:16:22,581 --> 00:16:24,549
So, you stick them up your nose?

213
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:27,747
Yeah.

214
00:16:27,886 --> 00:16:30,480
What? You've never done that?

215
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:34,686
Oh, my... Beckham does it all the time.

216
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,124
- Seriously?
- Yes.

217
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:38,729
Look. I'll just show you how to do it.

218
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:41,196
<i>Take that off and...</i>

219
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:44,097
...whatever that is.

220
00:16:44,236 --> 00:16:46,602
And you stick it right in.

221
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:48,070
It absorbs right up.

222
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:53,410
- Are you kidding me?
- That's disgusting.

223
00:16:53,545 --> 00:16:55,445
Oh, my God, your roommate's a freak.

224
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:57,572
That's so disgusting.

225
00:16:57,716 --> 00:17:01,652
Let's start the season
how we finished the last.

226
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:03,687
Sharp!

227
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:09,119
What are you, the runt of the family?

228
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:20,763
OK, shirts and skins.

229
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:24,334
Pardon me, sir. I have to be a shirt.

230
00:17:24,476 --> 00:17:26,944
- What?
- I'm allergic to the sun.

231
00:17:28,647 --> 00:17:30,274
You're allergic to the sun?

232
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:34,512
Very, very, very deathly,
deathly allergic.

233
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:36,746
We like to accommodate here at Illyria.

234
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:40,416
So I'll follow you around
with a parasol. All right, Nancy boy?

235
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,723
You're a shirt.

236
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:49,200
OK, guys, let's go.

237
00:17:50,302 --> 00:17:51,667
One, two, three!

238
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:54,898
One, two, three! One, two, three!

239
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:39,312
At ease, gentlemen.

240
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:48,021
I've seen a lot of energy
and commitment out there today.

241
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,355
And that makes a coach proud.

242
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:54,057
Now, I want to split us up
into first string and second string.

243
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:57,396
You second-stringers,
don't take it too hard.

244
00:18:57,536 --> 00:19:00,733
You're just as much part of this team
as the first-stringers.

245
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:04,240
Apart from, of course,
playing the game part.

246
00:19:04,376 --> 00:19:06,003
Schuler.

247
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:09,939
Haims.

248
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:13,542
Potensky.

249
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:17,182
Donner.

250
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:21,020
Hastings.

251
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,890
Second string.

252
00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:27,157
The rest of you, congratulations.
First-stringers.

253
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:28,561
Now, hit the showers.

254
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:32,928
Shower time.

255
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:34,868
Shower time?

256
00:19:41,146 --> 00:19:44,912
- Hastings! No shower for you.
- OK.

257
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:48,542
Principal Gold wants
to see you in his office.

258
00:19:53,825 --> 00:19:57,886
I'm over. It's done. They know.

259
00:20:00,566 --> 00:20:02,898
Sebastian's file.

260
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,674
Sebastian...

261
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:13,004
Could it be any bigger?

262
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:16,075
Mr. Hastings.

263
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:21,218
Horatio Gold...

264
00:20:21,353 --> 00:20:22,877
...headmaster.

265
00:20:23,021 --> 00:20:26,388
So very pleased to meet you.
So very, very pleased.

266
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:29,426
Hello, sir. Heard you wanted to see me.

267
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,961
I'd like to say welcome.

268
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,308
I just wanted to have you in
to say welcome.

269
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:45,967
See how you're doing.

270
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:49,979
Yeah, I'm doing great, you know?
Just... busy being a guy.

271
00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:52,015
Being a guy. Yeah.

272
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:56,484
Let's take a look at your file,
Sebastian. And...

273
00:20:56,622 --> 00:21:00,058
Seems to be... stuck a bit.

274
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:03,484
There we go. All right.

275
00:21:04,062 --> 00:21:07,327
OK. Well...

276
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:11,669
OK, you're busted.

277
00:21:14,206 --> 00:21:18,108
You don't wanna talk to the headmaster.
But I won't take no for an answer.

278
00:21:18,243 --> 00:21:22,612
Now, have a sit in the
headmaster's chair. Come on, have a sit.

279
00:21:22,748 --> 00:21:24,579
Sit it.

280
00:21:25,684 --> 00:21:29,950
So, Sebastian Hastings.

281
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:32,556
- How do you like campus?
- Beautiful.

282
00:21:32,691 --> 00:21:37,025
You've been inspired by the
charcoal black and candy apple red?

283
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:39,824
- You know it.
- Hey!

284
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:43,958
Don't touch it. Ever. Ever.
Do not do that.

285
00:21:44,102 --> 00:21:47,435
You know, Sebastian,
I was a transfer student myself...

286
00:21:48,573 --> 00:21:51,940
...once upon a time.
Back when dinosaurs roamed the earth.

287
00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:54,102
So I keep a special interest

288
00:21:54,246 --> 00:21:56,771
in the transfer students
that come to this school.

289
00:21:56,915 --> 00:22:00,407
Act as a... unofficial big brother.

290
00:22:00,552 --> 00:22:04,420
Don't be surprised if I just pop in
unannounced just to check up.

291
00:22:04,556 --> 00:22:08,117
Yeah, I look forward to it.

292
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,057
Now scoot!

293
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,594
Sorry.

294
00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:18,862
- Don't worry about it.
- My fault.

295
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:20,266
What is?

296
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:25,134
Getting to know the opposite sex,
are we?

297
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:29,077
Male-female dynamics.
All that sexual tension.

298
00:22:29,214 --> 00:22:32,445
It's all part of the high school
experience. So continue. Please.

299
00:22:32,584 --> 00:22:34,609
But keep it clean, though. OK.

300
00:22:34,753 --> 00:22:39,690
Abstinence is key. Abstinence is...
The best way to not is to not.

301
00:22:41,993 --> 00:22:43,392
Yes.

302
00:22:46,932 --> 00:22:49,457
Is he always that friendly?

303
00:22:49,601 --> 00:22:51,796
Are you kidding? That's him being rude.

304
00:22:53,939 --> 00:22:56,430
All right. Cute shoes.

305
00:22:56,575 --> 00:22:58,668
You think so?
I got them at Anthropologie.

306
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:02,439
- No way! They have shoes there?
- Oh, yeah. Right by the accessories.

307
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:06,510
Here are your books.

308
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:10,014
- Thanks.
- Well, I guess I'm gonna,

309
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:13,716
you know,
go take care of some guy stuff.

310
00:23:14,826 --> 00:23:15,918
OK.

311
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:24,194
There you go.
Have a great apple and sandwich.

312
00:23:24,336 --> 00:23:25,633
Hi! I would love a...

313
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:26,795
- No.
- But...

314
00:23:26,938 --> 00:23:30,066
Hey, dudes. Mind if I join?

315
00:23:31,009 --> 00:23:32,306
Thanks.

316
00:23:32,444 --> 00:23:34,844
So those soccer tryouts were bogus, huh?

317
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:39,917
I mean, second string? Come on, that's
ridiculous. Am I right? Am I right?

318
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:45,022
So the game against Cornwall,
that should be interesting.

319
00:23:45,157 --> 00:23:46,886
And why would that be interesting?

320
00:23:47,025 --> 00:23:51,826
Well, my sister goes there, and she
used to date that tool Justin Drayton.

321
00:23:51,963 --> 00:23:53,453
I know him.

322
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:55,896
- I made him cry once during a game.
- Wait.

323
00:23:56,034 --> 00:23:58,366
- That was you?
- Absolutely.

324
00:23:58,503 --> 00:24:00,334
- That was so funny.
- Wow.

325
00:24:00,472 --> 00:24:02,337
Is your sister hot?

326
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:06,400
I guess so.

327
00:24:06,545 --> 00:24:08,308
She's got a great personality.

328
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:12,143
Incoming.

329
00:24:16,888 --> 00:24:20,483
Oh, yeah! Check out the booty
on that blondie.

330
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:22,923
Don't talk about her that way.

331
00:24:23,061 --> 00:24:25,052
Is that your girlfriend?

332
00:24:25,197 --> 00:24:27,825
He wishes.

333
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:30,491
She was dating this college guy,
but he dumped her.

334
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:33,103
I hear she's a total mess now,
really vulnerable.

335
00:24:33,238 --> 00:24:35,570
Confidence, self-esteem is way down.

336
00:24:35,707 --> 00:24:38,676
- In man words, it's time to pounce.
- Exactly.

337
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,005
I hate that guy.

338
00:24:48,253 --> 00:24:51,188
Did you know bologna
is 38 percent hoof?

339
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:53,382
Thanks, Malcolm.

340
00:24:53,525 --> 00:24:56,358
Looks like you got some competition.

341
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:58,793
- It's just Malcolm.
- Total geek.

342
00:25:01,032 --> 00:25:03,865
She looks so sad. It's heartbreaking.

343
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,900
It... it's just...
I can relate, you know?

344
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:10,906
I mean, I just got out
of a bad relationship too.

345
00:25:11,042 --> 00:25:14,170
I mean, you think you know someone.

346
00:25:14,312 --> 00:25:17,907
And you realize it's all been a big lie.

347
00:25:18,049 --> 00:25:20,074
Every touch.

348
00:25:20,218 --> 00:25:22,584
Every kiss.

349
00:25:22,721 --> 00:25:27,249
Plus, you know,
you can never get chicks to shut up.

350
00:25:27,392 --> 00:25:30,418
All right, guys,
catch up with you later.

351
00:25:37,903 --> 00:25:40,497
Empty shower.

352
00:25:42,007 --> 00:25:43,770
Yes!

353
00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:48,573
I get to take a shower.
I get to take a shower.

354
00:25:57,122 --> 00:25:59,818
Malcolm Festes, dorm director.

355
00:25:59,958 --> 00:26:02,893
Shower shoes are to be worn
in the bathroom at all times

356
00:26:03,028 --> 00:26:04,893
except when in the actual shower.

357
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:07,726
Did you not read
your Dorm Life pamphlet?

358
00:26:07,866 --> 00:26:09,265
It was in your cubby.

359
00:26:11,536 --> 00:26:12,935
Wassup, dawg?

360
00:26:13,705 --> 00:26:15,798
Yeah. OK, homey.

361
00:26:21,212 --> 00:26:23,077
Later.

362
00:26:23,214 --> 00:26:27,583
Hey. You forgot... this, Coolio.

363
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:29,550
Word, G-Money.

364
00:26:50,208 --> 00:26:52,676
OK, Hastings, you're up!

365
00:26:54,879 --> 00:26:56,312
Hastings, are you deaf?!

366
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:59,110
Come on, let's go!

367
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:02,981
Get your butt out there! Come on!

368
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:04,986
Get out!

369
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:07,284
Jesus!

370
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:29,310
Come on, baby. Come on.

371
00:27:43,228 --> 00:27:44,559
Rise and shine.

372
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:48,928
Wait! Let go!

373
00:27:49,067 --> 00:27:50,091
Let go!

374
00:27:50,235 --> 00:27:53,466
Welcome to hell!

375
00:27:59,711 --> 00:28:05,445
Gentlemen! Let me present
this year's soccer newbies!

376
00:28:05,583 --> 00:28:07,551
First, you must remove your clothes!

377
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:10,416
Remove their clothes!
Remove their clothes!

378
00:28:10,555 --> 00:28:11,920
Take your clothes off now!

379
00:28:12,057 --> 00:28:14,184
Remove their clothes!

380
00:28:30,475 --> 00:28:32,602
Hello. My life sucks.

381
00:28:32,744 --> 00:28:33,768
<i>- I'm done!
- What?</i>

382
00:28:33,912 --> 00:28:35,812
Everybody thinks I'm a loser deviant.

383
00:28:35,947 --> 00:28:38,108
I'll never see the field
against Cornwall.

384
00:28:38,249 --> 00:28:40,979
And I smell so bad
I'm convulsing people.

385
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:45,180
<i>Pick me up, take me home and make sure
I never do anything like this again.</i>

386
00:28:45,323 --> 00:28:49,851
Look, Vi, I don't know what to tell you
about the whole soccer team...

387
00:28:49,994 --> 00:28:52,656
...but as for the social stuff,
I got an idea.

388
00:28:52,797 --> 00:28:55,163
<i>- You do?
- Yeah.</i>

389
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:58,463
We're gonna show everybody
the man that you really are.

390
00:28:58,603 --> 00:28:59,865
How are we gonna do that?

391
00:29:00,004 --> 00:29:01,471
Go, Viola.

392
00:29:03,842 --> 00:29:07,642
High five. Nice.

393
00:29:07,779 --> 00:29:10,646
Man. Look who's here.

394
00:29:10,782 --> 00:29:12,716
Foxy mama.

395
00:29:13,518 --> 00:29:15,645
Don't look at him.
Maybe he won't see us.

396
00:29:15,787 --> 00:29:18,551
Spread out so it looks like
we got no room.

397
00:29:21,192 --> 00:29:23,683
- What's up?
- What's up?

398
00:29:23,828 --> 00:29:25,056
Go, Kia.

399
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:34,470
- Hey, Sebastian.
- Kia.

400
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:38,841
Hey, girl. How you doing, baby?

401
00:29:38,977 --> 00:29:41,343
- Not the same without you.
- I know. I'm sorry.

402
00:29:41,479 --> 00:29:43,413
New school, new babe pool.

403
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:46,983
I miss you, Sebastian.

404
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:49,678
I've been thinking about you a lot.

405
00:29:49,821 --> 00:29:51,584
- Especially at night.
- Sweet.

406
00:29:51,723 --> 00:29:53,691
- And late.
- Even better.

407
00:29:53,825 --> 00:29:55,520
Did she just say that to Sebastian?

408
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:58,424
- What just happened?
- Oh, Sebastian.

409
00:29:58,563 --> 00:30:01,589
OK, big, mournful sigh.
Bittersweet farewell.

410
00:30:01,733 --> 00:30:03,166
You're his plaything, baby.

411
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:05,360
It was really great to see you,
Sebastian.

412
00:30:05,503 --> 00:30:08,529
Call me anytime.

413
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:17,047
I'd tap that.

414
00:30:17,182 --> 00:30:19,673
Thank you, Kia.
You're gorgeous. And go, Yvonne.

415
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:21,342
Women.

416
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:23,545
- Yeah.
- Yeah, you know what I'm saying?

417
00:30:26,691 --> 00:30:29,216
Sebastian? Is that you?

418
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,385
Hey, what's going on, Yvonne?

419
00:30:31,529 --> 00:30:33,087
- Who's this one?
- Nothing.

420
00:30:33,231 --> 00:30:37,531
I mean, our school lost its top gun,
Sebastian Hastings.

421
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:42,106
Well, time comes for a man
to move along, Yvonne.

422
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,401
I know, Sebastian.

423
00:30:44,542 --> 00:30:46,737
In the end I wasn't
woman enough for you.

424
00:30:46,878 --> 00:30:48,106
No, you weren't.

425
00:30:48,246 --> 00:30:50,737
That's something
I'll always have to live with.

426
00:30:50,882 --> 00:30:53,442
- It just hurts, that's all.
- Love is pain.

427
00:30:53,585 --> 00:30:56,748
Just know I'll never forget you,
Sebastian.

428
00:30:56,888 --> 00:30:59,823
Ever! Never!

429
00:31:05,897 --> 00:31:08,730
Needy.

430
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:13,133
OK. We might need
to do a little reevaluating here.

431
00:31:13,271 --> 00:31:16,104
- Yeah.
- Hey there, pretty lady.

432
00:31:16,241 --> 00:31:19,472
What? What are you, hitting on me?

433
00:31:19,611 --> 00:31:22,580
- I was just...
- "I was just..."

434
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:26,582
OK, let me put a stop
to that little brain fart right now.

435
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:30,882
Girls with asses like mine do not talk
to boys with faces like yours.

436
00:31:33,758 --> 00:31:37,922
I'm looking for my boyfriend Sebastian
Hastings. Have you guys seen him?

437
00:31:40,031 --> 00:31:41,328
Sebastian?

438
00:31:41,466 --> 00:31:44,026
Don't let her get too close,
she'll recognize you.

439
00:31:44,168 --> 00:31:46,261
What am I gonna do?

440
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:48,634
- Keep away from me!
- I beg your pardon?!

441
00:31:48,773 --> 00:31:51,799
Pretty ladies.
OK, don't come any closer, Monique.

442
00:31:51,943 --> 00:31:53,706
- Sebastian!
- It's over!

443
00:31:53,845 --> 00:31:55,278
What are you talking about?!

444
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:58,211
- I don't want to talk to you!
- Sebastian, come back here.

445
00:31:58,349 --> 00:32:00,180
You're hot, Monique. Smoking hot.

446
00:32:00,318 --> 00:32:02,252
Come here. Get! Get! Get!

447
00:32:02,387 --> 00:32:05,117
- But there are plenty of hot girls.
- Come back here.

448
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:10,489
And the truth is, you have absolutely
nothing else to offer.

449
00:32:10,628 --> 00:32:14,359
And when my eyes are closed,
I see you for what you truly are,

450
00:32:14,499 --> 00:32:18,265
which is ugly! We're done!

451
00:32:21,172 --> 00:32:24,539
That was amazing!

452
00:32:24,676 --> 00:32:26,007
You the man!

453
00:32:26,144 --> 00:32:29,272
What's wrong with you guys?
Make some room for the man.

454
00:32:29,414 --> 00:32:31,279
Sit down!

455
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:33,577
You're officially my idol now, man.

456
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:37,114
There he is.

457
00:32:37,255 --> 00:32:39,189
- What's up?
- What's up, brothers?

458
00:32:39,324 --> 00:32:41,622
- Hey, Sebastian.
- Lovelies.

459
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:44,284
- Holler at your boy.
- Yo! Yo! Sebastian!

460
00:32:44,429 --> 00:32:46,124
Can you get out of my way right now?

461
00:32:46,264 --> 00:32:48,391
I need your advice. I got lady troubles.

462
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:51,696
I'm here for you, bro.
I got a lifetime of knowledge.

463
00:32:52,403 --> 00:32:53,665
How long did you date?

464
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:57,070
Too long. Ball and frickin' chain, man.

465
00:33:00,945 --> 00:33:02,742
Dude.

466
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,509
Justine.
Chick won't stop dogging me, man.

467
00:33:07,719 --> 00:33:10,916
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
She's in our class.

468
00:33:11,055 --> 00:33:14,422
Dude, quit blushing. That's lame.

469
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:16,186
Shut up. I'm not blushing.

470
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:18,522
Everyone, please take a slip

471
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:21,393
and read off the name
of your lab partner.

472
00:33:24,402 --> 00:33:25,460
"Eunice Bates."

473
00:33:27,872 --> 00:33:30,204
You got to be kidding me.

474
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:32,536
- Be nice.
- Yeah.

475
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:34,440
She got something-something.

476
00:33:34,579 --> 00:33:37,412
Yeah, asthma and headgear.

477
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:42,050
"Olivia Lennox."

478
00:33:43,454 --> 00:33:45,615
- You know her?
- I talked to her for a second.

479
00:33:45,757 --> 00:33:47,384
About what? She gave you the nod.

480
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:49,584
- She did a good one.
- She gives good nod.

481
00:33:49,727 --> 00:33:51,126
Could everybody calm down?

482
00:33:51,262 --> 00:33:54,425
I can't believe you got her
as a lab par... Switch with me.

483
00:33:54,565 --> 00:33:57,261
I can't. I said her name out loud.

484
00:34:00,605 --> 00:34:03,631
Some guys just walk in the light,
you know?

485
00:34:03,775 --> 00:34:05,743
- Hello, again.
- Hello.

486
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:08,903
I don't think we introduced
ourselves before. I'm Sebastian.

487
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,036
Olivia.

488
00:34:16,621 --> 00:34:22,059
I'm gonna be the best
lab partner you ever had.

489
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:24,862
Cool.

490
00:34:24,996 --> 00:34:27,157
I gotta be completely honest.

491
00:34:27,298 --> 00:34:29,858
The whole dissecting thing
kind of freaks me out.

492
00:34:30,001 --> 00:34:32,765
So, think you may have
to take the reins on this one.

493
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:36,533
Wow. Most guys would never admit that.

494
00:34:36,674 --> 00:34:37,936
Oh, crap, you're right.

495
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:40,374
No, don't worry.
I think it's refreshing.

496
00:34:40,511 --> 00:34:43,002
- You do?
- No paper near the Bunsen burner.

497
00:34:43,147 --> 00:34:46,674
- Wait.
- What's this? Poems?

498
00:34:46,818 --> 00:34:48,945
Lyrics. They're his...

499
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:51,521
My... my old stuff.

500
00:34:51,656 --> 00:34:54,921
"Wake up, I've been waiting for you."

501
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:03,859
Those are really good. So honest.

502
00:35:04,001 --> 00:35:08,233
I know. I keep telling him...
me... meself... my... myself...

503
00:35:08,372 --> 00:35:10,237
I write songs too, Olivia.

504
00:35:10,374 --> 00:35:12,399
- Really? Wonderful.
- Check it out.

505
00:35:25,323 --> 00:35:26,847
You, you sit.

506
00:35:26,991 --> 00:35:30,757
You, go. Go!

507
00:35:30,895 --> 00:35:34,023
- Did you say anything about me?
- No. Was I supposed to?

508
00:35:34,165 --> 00:35:36,258
Come on. This is perfect.

509
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,426
You get to spend an hour
with her every other day.

510
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:41,663
You can convince her to go out with me.

511
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:44,274
She had that option
for three and a half years.

512
00:35:44,408 --> 00:35:48,208
I'll tell you what. You do this,
I'll work with you on your soccer.

513
00:35:48,346 --> 00:35:50,871
I'll make you good enough
to make first string.

514
00:35:51,015 --> 00:35:53,176
- By the Cornwall game?
- Absolutely.

515
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:55,842
OK, yeah. You got a deal.

516
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:58,785
- You're the man.
- Yes, I am.

517
00:37:51,002 --> 00:37:52,765
Right.

518
00:37:54,405 --> 00:37:58,068
Oh, for the love of God! It burns!

519
00:37:58,209 --> 00:37:59,733
It just isn't fair, Malvolio.

520
00:37:59,877 --> 00:38:03,472
I wait three years for Olivia,
and then some transfer student comes in

521
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:06,139
and suddenly she's acting like some...

522
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:09,651
...obsessed, love-struck teenager.

523
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:12,483
I'm not gonna take that lying down,
Malvolio!

524
00:38:13,691 --> 00:38:15,488
Yeah, I know. I know.

525
00:38:16,761 --> 00:38:18,160
You're absolutely right.

526
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:20,662
I'll do some digging,
I'll find out what it is,

527
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:24,097
and I'll nip his chances
with Olivia right in the bud.

528
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:29,233
What's that? Oh, yeah, sure.
A walk. Sorry. Come on.

529
00:38:30,508 --> 00:38:32,339
You are so smart.

530
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:34,034
Hello.

531
00:38:34,178 --> 00:38:35,941
<i>- Miss me?
- What's going on?</i>

532
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,547
What's wrong with your voice?

533
00:38:37,682 --> 00:38:40,014
I just have a little bit of a cold.

534
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:42,949
So... I'm still a little phlegmy.

535
00:38:43,087 --> 00:38:44,384
<i>- Call my school?
- Yeah.</i>

536
00:38:44,522 --> 00:38:47,753
It's all taken care of. Just make sure
you're back by the 12th.

537
00:38:47,892 --> 00:38:49,860
<i>It was so cool, Vi.</i>

538
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:52,861
<i>We went on a couple days early,
and the crowd flipped for us.</i>

539
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:56,228
<i>They wanted an encore, so we
did one of my songs acoustically.</i>

540
00:38:56,367 --> 00:38:59,268
- They went nuts for my lyrics.
- Oh, that's so cool.

541
00:38:59,403 --> 00:39:01,234
<i>And you were right about Monique.</i>

542
00:39:01,372 --> 00:39:02,805
She's history.

543
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:06,205
<i>- She really is, isn't she?
- I got to go. I'll talk to you later.</i>

544
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:08,972
OK. Bye.

545
00:39:09,113 --> 00:39:11,707
Trouble with your wig, Hastings?

546
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:14,647
No, I actually...
I have a scalp condition.

547
00:39:14,785 --> 00:39:16,377
- No, you don't.
- Yeah, I do.

548
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:19,045
I really do.
It's really acting up during the...

549
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:21,385
No, you don't.

550
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:23,720
You've got male pattern baldness.

551
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:25,829
Scoot over, kiddo.

552
00:39:25,963 --> 00:39:28,056
I don't know if you've realized,

553
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:30,565
but recently I've started
to thin out myself.

554
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:33,295
I've tried all the creams
and the butters,

555
00:39:33,437 --> 00:39:36,565
and I still can't seem to stop
Mother Nature's vindictive fury,

556
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:39,073
and neither can you.

557
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:41,735
There's gonna be a time
when you'll have to come out

558
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:44,507
of the closet and just
accept yourself for who you are.

559
00:39:44,648 --> 00:39:46,172
A baldy. OK?

560
00:39:46,317 --> 00:39:48,581
But it's gonna be all right. OK?

561
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:52,382
Oh, and between you and me,
chicks dig it.

562
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:58,085
Hang ten. Yeah.

563
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:01,756
Hi, Olivia. I don't want you
to be worried, but Malvolio's missing.

564
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:03,196
- Oh, no!
- Yeah.

565
00:40:03,334 --> 00:40:06,201
If you see him, don't feed him.
He has an irritable bowel.

566
00:40:06,337 --> 00:40:08,862
Yeah. 'Cause that
would be my very first instinct.

567
00:40:09,006 --> 00:40:11,839
To feed the tarantula.

568
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:20,607
Here's a wild idea.

569
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:23,879
Have you ever thought
about going out with Duke Orsino?

570
00:40:24,021 --> 00:40:25,545
I see that.

571
00:40:26,991 --> 00:40:28,288
- Duke?
- Yeah.

572
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:29,484
- No.
- Yeah.

573
00:40:29,627 --> 00:40:30,719
- No.
- Yeah.

574
00:40:30,861 --> 00:40:32,795
- Yeah?
- No!

575
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:35,296
I mean,
he's good-looking and everything,

576
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:38,231
but he's just not the guy for me.

577
00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:40,064
I don't know.

578
00:40:40,204 --> 00:40:42,798
Think there may be more to him
than you think there is.

579
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:45,704
So you're telling me
he's not just another dumb jock

580
00:40:45,843 --> 00:40:49,142
who wants to hook up with me so
he could tell his friends, but too?

581
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,807
- Insecure to treat you as an equal?
- Exactly.

582
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:54,076
Tell me about it.

583
00:40:54,218 --> 00:40:57,517
You're the first guy at school
who hasn't tried anything with me.

584
00:40:58,756 --> 00:41:00,417
Trust me, you're not my type.

585
00:41:01,725 --> 00:41:02,851
Well, why not?

586
00:41:06,864 --> 00:41:08,923
You know, it's just...

587
00:41:09,066 --> 00:41:11,364
...I don't think of you in that way.

588
00:41:11,502 --> 00:41:12,992
We're friends, you know.

589
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:15,367
You're actually one
of the few people here

590
00:41:15,506 --> 00:41:17,906
that I feel comfortable around.

591
00:41:18,042 --> 00:41:20,340
I feel the same way about you.

592
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:23,709
Good. Then just take my advice.

593
00:41:23,848 --> 00:41:26,874
Go out with Duke.

594
00:41:27,017 --> 00:41:28,712
I'll consider it.

595
00:41:30,354 --> 00:41:33,790
So, what is that exactly?

596
00:41:33,924 --> 00:41:36,051
I think that's the spleen.

597
00:41:40,731 --> 00:41:43,222
OK, who's your daddy?

598
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:48,900
I got her to agree to consider you.
You're halfway in.

599
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:51,564
All right, OK. So should I ask her out?

600
00:41:51,709 --> 00:41:53,540
No. You don't want to freak her out.

601
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:57,113
You got to have
a casual conversation first. Hello.

602
00:42:00,951 --> 00:42:04,250
Why do I get the feeling
you don't do this very often?

603
00:42:04,388 --> 00:42:07,983
Man, I just...
I'm not really good at talking to girls.

604
00:42:08,125 --> 00:42:10,218
- Why? You're hot!
- What?

605
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:12,761
You know, you're an appealing guy...

606
00:42:12,897 --> 00:42:15,798
Man... guy... guy-man.

607
00:42:15,933 --> 00:42:19,096
Look, I don't know.
I just always say the wrong...

608
00:42:19,236 --> 00:42:21,067
I just always say the wrong thing.

609
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:24,606
OK. All right. Come on. Let's get up.

610
00:42:24,742 --> 00:42:28,769
I want to try something. I'll act like
a girl, and you're going to talk to me.

611
00:42:28,913 --> 00:42:30,778
Do I have to?

612
00:42:30,915 --> 00:42:33,713
Yes! Because I'm Viola.

613
00:42:33,851 --> 00:42:35,910
- Duke? Nice to meet you.
- That was creepy.

614
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:38,283
You really just sounded
like a girl just then.

615
00:42:38,422 --> 00:42:40,356
I used to imitate
my sister all the time.

616
00:42:40,491 --> 00:42:42,959
I got really good at it.
Come on. And get up!

617
00:42:43,093 --> 00:42:45,687
Come on. Ask me some questions,

618
00:42:45,829 --> 00:42:48,957
and if the chemistry's right,
things'll just start flowing.

619
00:42:50,668 --> 00:42:54,297
- Questions about what?
- Anything. Ask me if...

620
00:42:54,438 --> 00:42:55,666
...I like...

621
00:42:55,806 --> 00:42:56,795
...cheese.

622
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:02,706
OK. Do you like cheese?

623
00:43:02,846 --> 00:43:05,679
Why, yes I do. My favorite's Gouda.

624
00:43:05,816 --> 00:43:09,149
- I like Gouda too.
- See?

625
00:43:09,286 --> 00:43:10,810
- See what?
- We're flowing.

626
00:43:10,955 --> 00:43:12,820
We're talking about cheese.

627
00:43:12,957 --> 00:43:14,356
So what? Flow is flow.

628
00:43:14,491 --> 00:43:16,618
What? What's that?

629
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:19,354
What is that?! It touched me!
It touched me!

630
00:43:19,496 --> 00:43:22,693
It's Malcolm's tarantula! Get it!

631
00:43:22,833 --> 00:43:25,028
- You get it!
- You're the guy!

632
00:43:25,169 --> 00:43:26,158
The bigger guy.

633
00:43:37,047 --> 00:43:38,241
Sorry!

634
00:43:38,382 --> 00:43:42,216
You don't ever,
ever do that girl voice again!

635
00:43:42,353 --> 00:43:44,344
- Freaked me out!
- My bad.

636
00:43:48,826 --> 00:43:50,885
<i>Sebastian, honey, this is your mother.</i>

637
00:43:51,028 --> 00:43:53,895
<i>I'm calling to remind you
about the carnival tomorrow.</i>

638
00:43:54,031 --> 00:43:57,398
<i>You and your sister promised
you'd both be there. Bye-bye.</i>

639
00:43:58,736 --> 00:44:01,227
Crap! Forgot about that!

640
00:44:01,372 --> 00:44:04,398
- Wait, your mom's in Junior League?
- Yeah. How'd you know?

641
00:44:04,541 --> 00:44:06,907
So is mine. I gotta go too.

642
00:44:07,044 --> 00:44:10,502
I can't deal with this right now.
I have soccer to worry about.

643
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:13,776
Not gonna be that bad.
Olivia's gonna be there.

644
00:44:13,917 --> 00:44:16,750
It's a perfect opportunity
for me to lay some groundwork.

645
00:44:16,887 --> 00:44:19,583
Oh, Olivia's gonna be there.

646
00:44:19,723 --> 00:44:21,088
And my sister.

647
00:44:21,225 --> 00:44:23,853
And Monique. And you.

648
00:44:23,994 --> 00:44:25,928
And my mom.

649
00:44:26,063 --> 00:44:28,258
Great.

650
00:44:38,409 --> 00:44:40,309
Dunk toss.

651
00:44:40,444 --> 00:44:41,433
Hey, dude!

652
00:44:41,578 --> 00:44:43,705
I will cut you, man.

653
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:46,748
I'll tell you the truth.
I never really liked carnivals.

654
00:44:46,884 --> 00:44:51,821
Hey. I'm working the kissing booth.
Come see me.

655
00:44:52,756 --> 00:44:55,657
I love carnivals, man.

656
00:44:55,793 --> 00:44:59,229
- Hey, Duke, where you going?
- Where do you think I'm going?

657
00:45:02,766 --> 00:45:04,529
- What's up?
- Oh, nothing.

658
00:45:04,668 --> 00:45:07,432
Just my psycho ex.
I don't really wanna deal with her.

659
00:45:07,571 --> 00:45:11,337
So if you guys don't mind,
I'm gonna lay low for a little while.

660
00:45:11,475 --> 00:45:14,672
- Cool. Catch you later.
- OK.

661
00:45:14,812 --> 00:45:16,245
Up you go!

662
00:45:18,982 --> 00:45:21,746
I see a kitten...

663
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:24,513
...gasping for air.

664
00:45:27,991 --> 00:45:30,585
Sorry. Pretty urgent.

665
00:45:34,498 --> 00:45:36,489
It's all yours.

666
00:45:37,601 --> 00:45:39,262
Hi, Mom!

667
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:42,964
You look like such a lady.
It's a miracle.

668
00:45:43,107 --> 00:45:45,507
- It really is.
- So Monique's getting you

669
00:45:45,642 --> 00:45:47,803
all excited about being a debutante?

670
00:45:47,945 --> 00:45:51,108
Super-duper excited.
Have a good carnival.

671
00:45:51,248 --> 00:45:54,183
My little petunia.
Where do you think you're going?

672
00:45:54,318 --> 00:45:56,513
You have the next shift
at the kissing booth.

673
00:45:56,653 --> 00:45:59,121
And your brother's late
for the cotton candy cart.

674
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:02,225
I'm gonna go look for him. Bye.

675
00:46:05,629 --> 00:46:08,723
- Sorry.
- Excuse you.

676
00:46:08,866 --> 00:46:11,994
- Wait, do I know you?
- No.

677
00:46:12,136 --> 00:46:13,899
Excuse me.

678
00:46:14,037 --> 00:46:15,368
Viola! Hey, hey, hey.

679
00:46:15,506 --> 00:46:18,339
Where you been?
I've been calling and calling.

680
00:46:18,475 --> 00:46:19,908
I miss you. We need to talk.

681
00:46:20,043 --> 00:46:22,409
We've talked, Justin.
All the talking is done.

682
00:46:22,546 --> 00:46:26,243
Look, no one breaks up
over a stupid soccer issue, OK?

683
00:46:26,383 --> 00:46:28,476
Can you just be a girl for five seconds?

684
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:30,246
For five seconds?

685
00:46:30,387 --> 00:46:34,084
OK, first of all,
it's not a stupid soccer issue,

686
00:46:34,224 --> 00:46:37,193
and you're a jerk.
Oh, look at that! Time's up!

687
00:46:39,663 --> 00:46:42,826
Excuse me. Sorry. One, please.

688
00:47:18,368 --> 00:47:19,995
Stay in school.

689
00:47:29,546 --> 00:47:32,447
Sebastian? Sebastian!

690
00:47:32,583 --> 00:47:35,245
- Monique's behind me.
- Where are you going?

691
00:47:35,385 --> 00:47:37,853
- We're on it.
- Sebastian!

692
00:47:45,395 --> 00:47:48,660
Excuse me. No one over 8 years old
is allowed inside the Moon Bounce.

693
00:47:48,799 --> 00:47:52,428
- I just saw my boyfriend go in there.
- The correct term is "ex-boyfriend."

694
00:47:52,569 --> 00:47:55,595
No relationship is over
until I say it is. Understand?

695
00:47:55,739 --> 00:47:58,230
You're still not getting
on that Moon Bounce.

696
00:47:58,375 --> 00:47:59,899
Fine.

697
00:48:05,349 --> 00:48:08,409
- What's that?
- Kia, don't look.

698
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:10,880
God!

699
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:27,499
- She's gone.
- Thank you.

700
00:48:27,638 --> 00:48:30,402
- So are we having fun?
- Oh, yeah, definitely.

701
00:48:34,478 --> 00:48:36,139
What do you think it will be like?

702
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:38,043
Duke, you look at me.

703
00:48:38,181 --> 00:48:40,979
I know it's gonna
be really, really special.

704
00:48:42,419 --> 00:48:45,183
I mean, she's only kissed
like 350 guys at this point.

705
00:48:45,322 --> 00:48:47,813
I just think we need
to acknowledge the moment.

706
00:48:47,958 --> 00:48:52,258
After four years, Duke
is finally gonna fulfill his destiny.

707
00:48:52,396 --> 00:48:57,424
Life is good.
Life is fair. Life is just.

708
00:48:57,567 --> 00:48:59,034
Hi, I'm your relief.

709
00:48:59,169 --> 00:49:01,364
- And yet...
- Thank God.

710
00:49:01,505 --> 00:49:02,870
I can't catch a break.

711
00:49:03,006 --> 00:49:07,966
Beware of the old guy chewing gum.
It's not gum.

712
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:13,014
- Do I know you?
- No.

713
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:16,252
That's just my luck.

714
00:49:16,386 --> 00:49:18,877
No. No, no, no.
I mean, I didn't mean it like that.

715
00:49:19,022 --> 00:49:23,049
<i>It's just, you know,
she's, you know... No. OK.</i>

716
00:49:23,193 --> 00:49:27,095
I mean, on the other hand,
you're, you know, also...

717
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:30,996
- I am? Thanks, I guess.
- Yeah.

718
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:34,661
You don't have to flirt with her first,
genius. You're paying for it.

719
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:39,606
Why don't you just... relax.

720
00:49:41,511 --> 00:49:43,274
Maybe I should kiss you now.

721
00:49:43,413 --> 00:49:47,349
I gave that girl my ticket,
and I waited in line.

722
00:49:47,484 --> 00:49:50,885
Well, it's the least I can do.

723
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:56,990
OK. Here I go.

724
00:50:10,374 --> 00:50:12,308
OK, I think that was one ticket's worth.

725
00:50:12,442 --> 00:50:14,103
No, you get a little bit more.

726
00:50:14,244 --> 00:50:16,906
Excuse me.
The motel's across the street.

727
00:50:17,047 --> 00:50:20,244
- Viola, what the hell is this?!
- Back of the line, buttball.

728
00:50:20,384 --> 00:50:24,218
Excuse me, doofus.
You're making out with my girlfriend.

729
00:50:24,354 --> 00:50:26,219
Ex-girlfriend.

730
00:50:26,356 --> 00:50:28,256
Whoa, you're Sebastian's sister?

731
00:50:28,392 --> 00:50:30,553
And you're about to die.

732
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:32,457
Are you gonna drown me in your tears?

733
00:50:32,596 --> 00:50:34,962
I did not cry.
I had something in my eye.

734
00:50:35,098 --> 00:50:37,464
You know what, guys?
Can we just dial it down?

735
00:50:37,601 --> 00:50:40,434
And just step away, OK?

736
00:50:40,570 --> 00:50:42,868
She's right.
I'll see you on the soccer field,

737
00:50:43,006 --> 00:50:45,304
and we'll settle this all then.

738
00:50:45,442 --> 00:50:47,273
OK, Duke.

739
00:50:47,411 --> 00:50:50,471
Or we can straighten it out right here.

740
00:50:50,614 --> 00:50:52,673
Justin! Stop it! Guys!

741
00:50:57,294 --> 00:50:59,262
Stop it! Justin!

742
00:50:59,396 --> 00:51:01,421
Guys! Stop it!

743
00:51:04,701 --> 00:51:08,432
Justin, get off!

744
00:51:18,615 --> 00:51:21,175
Where's my daughter?!

745
00:51:21,318 --> 00:51:23,252
Excuse me. I'm so sorry.

746
00:51:23,387 --> 00:51:26,914
Viola! Stop! This isn't ladylike.

747
00:51:27,057 --> 00:51:29,617
There is no room for violence here!

748
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:34,163
This is a lovely children's carnival,
goddamn it!

749
00:51:34,297 --> 00:51:36,925
Both of you, out! Now!

750
00:51:41,738 --> 00:51:44,104
Where were you at today?
You just disappeared.

751
00:51:44,241 --> 00:51:47,301
Ran into my psycho ex. Had to bolt.

752
00:51:47,444 --> 00:51:49,469
Oh, my God! Is that a?

753
00:51:49,613 --> 00:51:52,514
What? Yeah.

754
00:51:52,649 --> 00:51:56,779
I hope you don't mind.
I kind of borrowed one of your...

755
00:51:56,920 --> 00:52:00,151
Yeah. And you're right, by the way.
These things actually work.

756
00:52:00,290 --> 00:52:02,383
Oh, my God, you're bleeding.
Are you OK?

757
00:52:04,161 --> 00:52:08,222
I mean, suck it up! Be a man!
Rub some dirt in it!

758
00:52:08,365 --> 00:52:11,493
OK, I'll rub some dirt on it.

759
00:52:11,635 --> 00:52:14,900
So, what happened?

760
00:52:15,038 --> 00:52:17,063
I got into it with your sister's ex.

761
00:52:17,207 --> 00:52:20,699
Wait. Really? Why?

762
00:52:20,844 --> 00:52:25,645
He saw me and her kind of
making out at the kissing booth.

763
00:52:25,782 --> 00:52:28,512
Wait. You kissed her?

764
00:52:28,652 --> 00:52:31,246
Yeah, man, I'm... I hope that's OK.

765
00:52:31,388 --> 00:52:33,356
It was for charity.

766
00:52:33,490 --> 00:52:36,425
Oh, no, I mean, dude, I mean,

767
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:40,360
if you want to kiss her,
you go right ahead and you kiss her!

768
00:52:40,497 --> 00:52:41,862
I mean, knock yourself out.

769
00:52:41,998 --> 00:52:45,434
I mean, you just...
you take her and then kiss her

770
00:52:45,569 --> 00:52:47,093
and kiss the crap out of her!

771
00:52:48,004 --> 00:52:49,665
OK.

772
00:52:53,743 --> 00:52:56,041
So...

773
00:52:56,179 --> 00:52:57,510
...do you like her?

774
00:52:57,647 --> 00:53:00,946
I don't know.
Can we not talk about this?

775
00:53:01,084 --> 00:53:03,279
She's your sister. It's kind of weird.

776
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:05,547
No. Right. Right.

777
00:53:05,689 --> 00:53:10,319
Just... You know,
I was just thinking that,

778
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:13,054
if you liked her then...

779
00:53:13,196 --> 00:53:15,596
...maybe you should ask her out.

780
00:53:15,732 --> 00:53:19,065
And just, I don't know,
forget about Olivia?

781
00:53:19,202 --> 00:53:23,866
Well, I mean,
speaking as a completely objective

782
00:53:24,007 --> 00:53:28,501
third-party outsider with absolutely
no personal interest in the matter,

783
00:53:28,645 --> 00:53:32,479
I am not sure that you and Olivia

784
00:53:32,616 --> 00:53:35,414
really mesh well together.
You know? I mean...

785
00:53:35,552 --> 00:53:38,749
But you and Viola...

786
00:53:38,889 --> 00:53:41,084
...I mean...

787
00:53:41,224 --> 00:53:42,555
...be magic.

788
00:53:42,692 --> 00:53:44,284
I don't know.

789
00:53:44,427 --> 00:53:46,987
What does your heart tell you?

790
00:53:47,130 --> 00:53:50,122
I mean, which one would you
rather see naked?!

791
00:53:50,267 --> 00:53:53,259
Why do you? Why?
Why do you always do that?

792
00:53:53,403 --> 00:53:56,429
Why do you always talk about girls
in such graphic terms?

793
00:53:58,241 --> 00:54:00,436
You know what? You... you have issues.

794
00:54:00,577 --> 00:54:04,377
You're a really sensitive guy,
aren't you?

795
00:54:04,514 --> 00:54:07,813
What? No. No, it's just...

796
00:54:09,352 --> 00:54:11,877
I don't know. I just think that

797
00:54:12,022 --> 00:54:16,220
relationships should be more
than just the physical stuff.

798
00:54:16,359 --> 00:54:18,884
Don't get me wrong,
that stuff's important,

799
00:54:19,029 --> 00:54:20,826
but when I'm with someone,

800
00:54:20,964 --> 00:54:24,559
I want to be able
to talk about other stuff.

801
00:54:24,701 --> 00:54:27,727
Like, I don't know, serious stuff.

802
00:54:27,871 --> 00:54:31,602
Stuff I can't talk about,
you know, with anyone else.

803
00:54:34,544 --> 00:54:36,637
Yeah, like...

804
00:54:37,814 --> 00:54:39,475
...what kind of stuff?

805
00:54:40,483 --> 00:54:42,747
I don't know, just stuff.

806
00:54:42,886 --> 00:54:46,219
Like, whatever stuff there is.

807
00:54:46,356 --> 00:54:49,883
Like... this kind of stuff?

808
00:54:50,026 --> 00:54:53,393
Yeah.

809
00:54:53,530 --> 00:54:56,090
But what I just told you
is for your ears only.

810
00:54:56,232 --> 00:55:00,066
If you tell anyone, I'll kick your ass.

811
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:05,533
Yeah. No.

812
00:55:05,675 --> 00:55:08,803
I got your back, man.

813
00:55:08,945 --> 00:55:11,914
It's cool.

814
00:56:25,855 --> 00:56:27,186
How's your sister?

815
00:56:31,294 --> 00:56:33,524
Good. Why?

816
00:56:34,531 --> 00:56:36,556
I don't know.

817
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:39,828
I kind of was thinking
I might ask if she wanted

818
00:56:39,969 --> 00:56:41,994
to grab dinner at Cesario's tonight.

819
00:56:42,138 --> 00:56:45,767
You were? Really? I'd love to.

820
00:56:45,909 --> 00:56:46,898
What?

821
00:56:47,043 --> 00:56:49,307
I'd love to give her your phone number.

822
00:56:49,446 --> 00:56:51,346
Hastings!

823
00:56:51,481 --> 00:56:52,880
Yeah, coach?

824
00:56:54,551 --> 00:56:56,849
You're first string
for the Cornwall game.

825
00:56:56,986 --> 00:56:58,078
- Really?
- No.

826
00:56:58,221 --> 00:57:01,054
I was joking, you idiot.

827
00:57:03,259 --> 00:57:05,250
Dude, that's awesome.

828
00:57:09,532 --> 00:57:11,193
Dude.

829
00:57:13,937 --> 00:57:16,804
- So, you want me to spot you?
- No.

830
00:57:16,940 --> 00:57:19,966
- Isn't he cute?
- Duke? Yeah.

831
00:57:20,110 --> 00:57:23,204
No. Sebastian. He's so cool.

832
00:57:25,115 --> 00:57:26,639
But he said I'm not his type.

833
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:29,377
- Impossible. You're everyone's type.
- Not his.

834
00:57:29,519 --> 00:57:33,478
I could tell you what us mere mortals
would do in this situation.

835
00:57:33,623 --> 00:57:35,887
- What?
- Make him jealous.

836
00:57:36,025 --> 00:57:39,051
So, what do you do?
You just pretend to like somebody else?

837
00:57:39,195 --> 00:57:42,096
And then use him shamelessly.

838
00:57:42,632 --> 00:57:43,826
Wow.

839
00:57:46,202 --> 00:57:49,399
So, you should call Viola up.

840
00:57:50,507 --> 00:57:52,338
Yeah. I think I will.

841
00:57:54,611 --> 00:57:55,635
Hey, Duke.

842
00:57:55,779 --> 00:57:59,044
- Sebastian.
- Olivia.

843
00:57:59,182 --> 00:58:00,479
Olivia.

844
00:58:00,617 --> 00:58:02,847
What're you bench-pressing these days?

845
00:58:02,986 --> 00:58:06,149
225. Very impressive.

846
00:58:06,289 --> 00:58:07,813
Thanks.

847
00:58:07,957 --> 00:58:11,188
So, Duke, about that call
that you were gonna make.

848
00:58:11,327 --> 00:58:13,522
- You gonna make that?
- Yeah. Thank you.

849
00:58:13,663 --> 00:58:16,325
So how many reps
can you do with that 225?

850
00:58:16,466 --> 00:58:19,697
Like 20... 20.

851
00:58:19,836 --> 00:58:22,999
225 is more than twice what I weigh.

852
00:58:23,139 --> 00:58:25,198
How many reps could you do with me?

853
00:58:27,277 --> 00:58:28,437
Forty.

854
00:58:34,851 --> 00:58:35,909
Hello?

855
00:58:36,052 --> 00:58:37,280
Hi, it's Viola.

856
00:58:37,420 --> 00:58:40,355
<i>Sebastian told me to call you.</i>

857
00:58:40,490 --> 00:58:43,618
- I'd love to go to dinner.
- Yeah. What?

858
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:46,490
Can I call you back?

859
00:58:46,629 --> 00:58:49,393
Because I gotta...

860
00:58:49,532 --> 00:58:51,864
...change my feet.

861
00:58:52,001 --> 00:58:55,562
So, do you have any plans tonight?

862
00:58:57,974 --> 00:58:59,066
My bad.

863
00:58:59,209 --> 00:59:02,940
What about the thing that we talked
about that you were going to do later?

864
00:59:03,079 --> 00:59:04,671
What thing? I'm thingless.

865
00:59:04,814 --> 00:59:08,511
Great! Then it's a date.
Cesario's, 8:00.

866
00:59:08,651 --> 00:59:10,414
- I'll see you there.
- OK.

867
00:59:11,988 --> 00:59:14,081
- Bye, Sebastian.
- Later.

868
00:59:17,427 --> 00:59:18,758
Yeah!

869
00:59:19,996 --> 00:59:21,190
You did it.

870
00:59:21,331 --> 00:59:23,526
I'm goin' out with Olivia.

871
00:59:23,666 --> 00:59:26,134
What the hell?!
I thought you liked Viola now!

872
00:59:26,269 --> 00:59:29,170
Dude, come on. You're a guy.

873
00:59:29,305 --> 00:59:33,071
What would you do
if the hottest girl in the school

874
00:59:33,209 --> 00:59:37,646
came up to you
and asked you on a date?

875
00:59:37,780 --> 00:59:39,247
I'll be right back.

876
00:59:39,382 --> 00:59:42,545
Olivia? Hi.
Can I talk to you for a second?

877
00:59:42,685 --> 00:59:44,550
<i>Moi? Whatever for?</i>

878
00:59:44,687 --> 00:59:46,382
It's about your date with Duke.

879
00:59:46,522 --> 00:59:50,891
I know! I am so glad I listened to you.
You're right. He's awesome.

880
00:59:51,027 --> 00:59:55,088
And he looked so good
in those shorts.

881
00:59:56,633 --> 00:59:59,500
He's not a piece of meat, Olivia.

882
00:59:59,636 --> 01:00:02,503
He's a man. A man with feelings.

883
01:00:02,639 --> 01:00:05,073
And I'm a woman with feelings.

884
01:00:05,208 --> 01:00:08,075
And my feelings seem to match his.

885
01:00:08,211 --> 01:00:10,577
You know what?

886
01:00:10,713 --> 01:00:14,171
Speaking as a completely objective
third-party observer

887
01:00:14,317 --> 01:00:17,081
with absolutely
no personal interest in the matter,

888
01:00:17,220 --> 01:00:21,020
I'm not so sure that you
and Duke are a good idea after all.

889
01:00:21,157 --> 01:00:22,818
Well, thank you for your concern.

890
01:00:22,959 --> 01:00:26,690
And if you're so worried, maybe
you should come to Cesario's tonight,

891
01:00:26,829 --> 01:00:30,788
just to keep an eye on me.
We could double.

892
01:00:30,934 --> 01:00:33,061
I bet Eunice is available.

893
01:00:34,437 --> 01:00:38,396
I'm so there, it's insane.

894
01:00:50,586 --> 01:00:54,522
So do you like... cheese?

895
01:00:59,429 --> 01:01:02,887
- Hey, you two, what's going on?
- You're here...

896
01:01:03,032 --> 01:01:05,227
...with Eunice.

897
01:01:05,368 --> 01:01:06,392
Mind if we join?

898
01:01:06,536 --> 01:01:08,060
- No. Sit down.
- No, no, no.

899
01:01:08,204 --> 01:01:10,365
Lady pterodactyl.

900
01:01:11,874 --> 01:01:13,705
Waiter!

901
01:01:15,044 --> 01:01:16,170
Help.

902
01:01:19,749 --> 01:01:21,011
So...

903
01:01:21,150 --> 01:01:23,516
...I was just telling Duke
how great it is

904
01:01:23,653 --> 01:01:26,178
to meet a real man at this school.

905
01:01:26,322 --> 01:01:28,256
You were?

906
01:01:28,391 --> 01:01:30,416
Well, I was just about to.

907
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:32,960
Isn't it great to have
a real man around, Eunice?

908
01:01:33,096 --> 01:01:35,530
Oh, yes.

909
01:01:35,665 --> 01:01:38,156
A real man is difficult to find.

910
01:01:41,337 --> 01:01:42,804
So difficult.

911
01:01:42,939 --> 01:01:46,875
Sebastian's with Eunice.
She must be hotter than I thought.

912
01:01:47,010 --> 01:01:49,877
How come when I wanted
to ask out Eunice everyone made fun?

913
01:01:50,013 --> 01:01:52,140
Sebastian likes her,
suddenly she's cool?

914
01:01:52,281 --> 01:01:54,010
Screw you guys. I hate high school.

915
01:01:55,918 --> 01:01:58,887
Eunice! Hands!

916
01:01:59,022 --> 01:02:02,355
You know what? This has been real fun,
but I have to go...

917
01:02:03,693 --> 01:02:05,661
...shave.

918
01:02:06,662 --> 01:02:08,027
OK.

919
01:02:09,699 --> 01:02:13,601
Well, this has been lovely.
Let's do it again sometime.

920
01:02:13,736 --> 01:02:17,103
- What?
- Soon. Bye.

921
01:02:19,142 --> 01:02:21,042
So...

922
01:02:22,645 --> 01:02:24,670
...do you like cheese?

923
01:02:24,814 --> 01:02:29,342
More than almost
any other animal byproduct.

924
01:02:29,485 --> 01:02:31,953
Yeah, check please.

925
01:02:32,088 --> 01:02:33,578
Hey Monique, it's Sebastian.

926
01:02:33,723 --> 01:02:35,918
I don't know
if Viola told you I'm in London,

927
01:02:36,059 --> 01:02:38,254
but I'm heading home a day early.

928
01:02:38,394 --> 01:02:40,919
Listen, I've been thinking,

929
01:02:41,064 --> 01:02:44,500
and we really need to talk.

930
01:02:44,634 --> 01:02:44,734
Ladies...

931
01:02:44,734 --> 01:02:46,599
Ladies...

932
01:02:46,736 --> 01:02:48,397
Ladies.

933
01:02:49,572 --> 01:02:50,869
Welcome.

934
01:02:51,007 --> 01:02:54,943
My name is Cheryl Lancaster,
president of the Stratford Junior League

935
01:02:55,078 --> 01:02:58,536
and coordinator
of this year's debutante season.

936
01:02:58,681 --> 01:02:59,943
Oh, please.

937
01:03:00,083 --> 01:03:02,881
Thank you. Today we're
gonna go over the guidelines

938
01:03:03,019 --> 01:03:08,150
for a graceful,
ladylike entre into society.

939
01:03:09,425 --> 01:03:12,656
Son of a...

940
01:03:13,362 --> 01:03:14,624
Hello.

941
01:03:14,764 --> 01:03:17,198
Hello there.

942
01:03:21,971 --> 01:03:23,734
- Hi.
- Make sure she's in the back

943
01:03:23,873 --> 01:03:24,999
for the group photo.

944
01:03:25,141 --> 01:03:28,338
Thank you for joining us, Viola.

945
01:03:28,478 --> 01:03:31,413
Now, who's ready to come out?

946
01:03:31,547 --> 01:03:32,673
Kill me.

947
01:03:51,234 --> 01:03:53,759
Viola? Darling.

948
01:03:53,903 --> 01:03:57,896
Remember, chew like you have a secret.

949
01:04:05,515 --> 01:04:07,881
Excuse me.

950
01:04:10,119 --> 01:04:11,711
Ladies.

951
01:04:24,534 --> 01:04:27,230
- Hi.
- Hey.

952
01:04:27,370 --> 01:04:30,737
Hey! You're the one that saved me
in the kissing booth that one time?

953
01:04:30,873 --> 01:04:33,398
- Hi.
- Hi.

954
01:04:33,543 --> 01:04:36,478
Oh, what a small world. I'm Viola.

955
01:04:36,612 --> 01:04:37,704
Olivia.

956
01:04:37,847 --> 01:04:39,872
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

957
01:04:43,986 --> 01:04:45,920
So...

958
01:04:46,055 --> 01:04:47,750
I know it's none of my business,

959
01:04:47,890 --> 01:04:50,324
but you went out
with that Duke Orsino guy, right?

960
01:04:50,459 --> 01:04:53,860
Yeah. Once.

961
01:04:53,996 --> 01:04:56,226
- Did you kiss him?
- No, why?

962
01:04:56,365 --> 01:04:59,766
Oh, no. It's nothing, but...

963
01:04:59,902 --> 01:05:02,427
Just try to postpone it
as long as possible.

964
01:05:02,572 --> 01:05:06,303
He has this salivary gland condition.

965
01:05:06,442 --> 01:05:10,538
Yeah. He doesn't
really like to talk about it,

966
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:12,875
but it felt like I was drowning.

967
01:05:13,015 --> 01:05:14,346
Really?

968
01:05:15,518 --> 01:05:18,885
- Oh, my God.
- I know. It was repulsive.

969
01:05:19,021 --> 01:05:21,819
But, hey, every happiness to you both.

970
01:05:21,958 --> 01:05:26,258
No, actually, I don't really like Duke.

971
01:05:28,431 --> 01:05:31,195
I have this huge thing
for his roommate, Sebastian.

972
01:05:31,334 --> 01:05:35,293
And I was just trying
to make Sebastian jealous.

973
01:05:42,645 --> 01:05:43,976
Oh, boy.

974
01:05:44,113 --> 01:05:47,241
Yeah, I know it's really wrong
to use a person this way,

975
01:05:47,383 --> 01:05:49,943
and I feel really terrible about it.

976
01:05:50,086 --> 01:05:52,145
But I really, really like Sebastian.

977
01:05:52,288 --> 01:05:54,017
He's so handsome,

978
01:05:54,156 --> 01:05:56,647
not the goonish handsome
you see in a lot of guys.

979
01:05:56,792 --> 01:06:01,024
He's a delicate, like,
even refined handsome, you know?

980
01:06:01,163 --> 01:06:06,191
Oh, and when he smiles,
I just can't stop looking at him.

981
01:06:06,335 --> 01:06:09,395
He's just so wonderful.

982
01:06:09,538 --> 01:06:12,029
You know, Olivia...

983
01:06:12,174 --> 01:06:13,698
- It's Olivia, right?
- Yeah.

984
01:06:13,843 --> 01:06:17,074
I'm gonna give you just a little advice.

985
01:06:17,213 --> 01:06:19,010
- OK.
- Enough is enough!

986
01:06:19,148 --> 01:06:23,016
You are weaving a really tangled web.

987
01:06:23,152 --> 01:06:24,642
Like really, really tangled.

988
01:06:24,787 --> 01:06:27,984
And, honey... you got to stop!

989
01:06:28,124 --> 01:06:30,718
OK? So you just
gotta tell everybody the truth.

990
01:06:30,860 --> 01:06:32,259
Be very, very honest.

991
01:06:32,395 --> 01:06:35,728
Just let the chips fall where they may.

992
01:06:35,865 --> 01:06:37,196
- You're right.
- I know.

993
01:06:37,333 --> 01:06:40,063
The next time I see Sebastian
I'll march right up to him.

994
01:06:40,202 --> 01:06:42,261
- You march!
- And I'll tell him how I feel.

995
01:06:42,405 --> 01:06:43,599
You tell him.

996
01:06:43,739 --> 01:06:45,673
Then I'll kiss him so passionately,

997
01:06:45,808 --> 01:06:49,005
that even the people
he hates will feel pleasure.

998
01:06:51,314 --> 01:06:52,542
Hello, Viola.

999
01:06:52,682 --> 01:06:54,513
Oh, this is not good.

1000
01:06:54,650 --> 01:06:57,380
And hello to you,
you little homewrecker.

1001
01:06:57,520 --> 01:07:01,217
- Who are you?
- I am Sebastian's girlfriend.

1002
01:07:01,357 --> 01:07:02,847
Ex-girlfriend.

1003
01:07:02,992 --> 01:07:05,187
OK, everybody's got to stop saying that.

1004
01:07:05,328 --> 01:07:08,354
You were the one he dumped
in the pizza parlor the other day.

1005
01:07:08,497 --> 01:07:11,193
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
He did not dump me.

1006
01:07:11,334 --> 01:07:13,962
We're just going through
a little bit of a rough patch.

1007
01:07:14,103 --> 01:07:17,231
I heard he dumped you.
He dumped you big.

1008
01:07:17,373 --> 01:07:20,740
It was just like a big, huge dumping.

1009
01:07:29,852 --> 01:07:31,979
Are you crazy?! Are you OK?

1010
01:07:32,121 --> 01:07:33,713
Get out!

1011
01:07:35,624 --> 01:07:38,058
You are messing with the wrong man!

1012
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:47,658
Get off me! Get off of me!

1013
01:08:14,163 --> 01:08:15,596
- Get off of her!
- Let go of me!

1014
01:08:15,731 --> 01:08:18,928
Ladies! Ladies, stop!

1015
01:08:19,068 --> 01:08:20,763
Please!

1016
01:08:23,839 --> 01:08:28,572
When debutantes disagree
they say it with their eyes.

1017
01:08:30,346 --> 01:08:31,938
Well, Hastings.

1018
01:08:32,081 --> 01:08:35,676
Why is it that I always find you
in the middle of a tussle?

1019
01:08:37,353 --> 01:08:39,048
Bad timing?

1020
01:08:39,188 --> 01:08:41,213
I am convinced he's hiding something.

1021
01:08:41,357 --> 01:08:45,054
Nonsense, Malcolm.
He may be a little lost and confused,

1022
01:08:45,194 --> 01:08:49,290
but deep down he's an all-American,
red-blooded male.

1023
01:08:49,432 --> 01:08:51,525
- Just like yourself.
- Mom, I will pick out

1024
01:08:51,667 --> 01:08:54,397
my own dress.
And no, I will not wear heels.

1025
01:08:54,537 --> 01:08:57,165
Because heels are a male invention

1026
01:08:57,306 --> 01:09:00,503
designed to make
a woman's butt look smaller.

1027
01:09:00,643 --> 01:09:03,476
And to make it harder
for them to run away.

1028
01:09:08,818 --> 01:09:12,948
Malcolm, have you ever tried
to run away in high heels?

1029
01:09:13,088 --> 01:09:16,148
- No, sir, I wouldn't...
- Not that easy. Not that easy.

1030
01:09:27,903 --> 01:09:30,633
Don't forget your guitar, Mr. Hastings.

1031
01:09:30,773 --> 01:09:34,504
Just do it.
Just close your eyes and kiss him.

1032
01:09:40,649 --> 01:09:42,617
Sebastian.

1033
01:09:46,789 --> 01:09:49,314
"Wake up. I've been waiting
for you to open your eyes

1034
01:09:49,458 --> 01:09:51,153
so I can tell you I think I'm ready.

1035
01:09:51,293 --> 01:09:54,057
I'm ready to free-fall
into the unknown."

1036
01:09:54,196 --> 01:09:56,687
I'll see you at the game tomorrow.

1037
01:10:02,204 --> 01:10:04,672
I think I'm gonna like this school.

1038
01:10:11,881 --> 01:10:13,576
<i>Monique, it's Sebastian.</i>

1039
01:10:13,716 --> 01:10:15,911
<i>I don't know if Viola
told you I'm in London,</i>

1040
01:10:16,051 --> 01:10:18,178
<i>but I'm heading home a day early.</i>

1041
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:21,756
<i>Listen, I've been thinking.
We really need to talk.</i>

1042
01:10:21,891 --> 01:10:24,860
London?

1043
01:10:28,497 --> 01:10:31,227
Hey, brother.
Dinklage was looking for you, man.

1044
01:10:32,601 --> 01:10:36,435
Dude. Hello!

1045
01:10:36,572 --> 01:10:39,541
You know, it's... crazy

1046
01:10:39,675 --> 01:10:42,439
how wrong you can be about a person.

1047
01:10:42,578 --> 01:10:45,741
It's crazy.

1048
01:10:46,615 --> 01:10:48,378
You think they're one thing,

1049
01:10:48,517 --> 01:10:51,953
and then they turn out
to be the exact opposite.

1050
01:10:52,087 --> 01:10:54,954
- What are you talking about?
- You're gonna sit there

1051
01:10:55,090 --> 01:10:56,926
and act like you don't know
what I'm talking about?

1052
01:10:56,926 --> 01:10:57,585
and act like you don't know
what I'm talking about?

1053
01:11:00,930 --> 01:11:02,727
OK.

1054
01:11:02,865 --> 01:11:05,527
All right. OK.

1055
01:11:07,536 --> 01:11:10,061
I wanted to tell you, Duke, but...

1056
01:11:10,205 --> 01:11:12,230
...you have to know...

1057
01:11:12,374 --> 01:11:15,366
...I love soccer more
than anything else in the world,

1058
01:11:15,511 --> 01:11:16,876
and I had a point to prove.

1059
01:11:17,012 --> 01:11:19,480
What?! So you're telling me
that you used me

1060
01:11:19,615 --> 01:11:20,912
to help you with soccer,

1061
01:11:21,050 --> 01:11:23,314
and then you turn around
and stab me in the back?

1062
01:11:23,452 --> 01:11:26,888
Wait, what? Now I really don't know
what you're talking about.

1063
01:11:27,022 --> 01:11:29,115
Save it, man. I saw you with her.

1064
01:11:29,258 --> 01:11:32,125
- With who?!
- Who?! Olivia, that's who!

1065
01:11:32,261 --> 01:11:34,889
- You kissed when you got out the cab!
- What cab?!

1066
01:11:35,030 --> 01:11:37,362
- We were supposed to be friends!
- We are!

1067
01:11:37,499 --> 01:11:41,526
- You don't know the meaning!
- Olivia never liked you, OK?!

1068
01:11:41,670 --> 01:11:44,366
She was just using you
to make me jealous.

1069
01:11:44,506 --> 01:11:46,440
But Viola, she's crazy about you,

1070
01:11:46,575 --> 01:11:49,009
since the first moment
that you kissed her.

1071
01:11:49,144 --> 01:11:52,580
I bet that's part of your plan. Distract
me so you can move in to Olivia.

1072
01:11:52,715 --> 01:11:56,776
- That is not what happened!
- You and your sister have a good life!

1073
01:12:00,589 --> 01:12:03,456
"The Hastings twins
couldn't be more opposite."

1074
01:12:04,460 --> 01:12:06,485
- Twins?
- Sebastian?

1075
01:12:06,629 --> 01:12:09,154
Sebastian?

1076
01:12:09,298 --> 01:12:11,061
Sebastian, open up!

1077
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:13,828
It's Monique!
You have got a lot of explaining to do,

1078
01:12:13,969 --> 01:12:16,403
followed by a very long night
of groveling!

1079
01:12:16,538 --> 01:12:18,768
He's not here!

1080
01:12:21,343 --> 01:12:25,507
Take his stupid cell phone.
Justine calls every ten seconds.

1081
01:12:29,051 --> 01:12:30,951
This isn't Sebastian's phone.

1082
01:12:31,887 --> 01:12:34,788
God! Sebastian!

1083
01:12:34,923 --> 01:12:37,653
- Sebastian!
- Can I help you?

1084
01:12:41,063 --> 01:12:42,928
<i>- Hello?
- Viola. Hey, baby.</i>

1085
01:12:43,065 --> 01:12:45,727
<i>It's Justin. You know,
the big game is tomorrow and...</i>

1086
01:12:45,868 --> 01:12:47,859
Viola.

1087
01:12:48,003 --> 01:12:50,563
Allow me to introduce myself.

1088
01:12:50,706 --> 01:12:54,699
2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007...

1089
01:12:54,843 --> 01:12:58,279
<i>Nice night...2008.</i>

1090
01:12:58,414 --> 01:13:00,575
Hey, Eunice.

1091
01:13:02,618 --> 01:13:04,381
Sorry about running out on our date.

1092
01:13:04,520 --> 01:13:09,219
That's OK.
My intensity scares some people.

1093
01:13:09,358 --> 01:13:11,383
Yeah.

1094
01:13:11,527 --> 01:13:13,722
Is something wrong?

1095
01:13:13,862 --> 01:13:16,558
Got thrown out of my room.

1096
01:13:16,699 --> 01:13:20,567
You mean... you need a place to sleep?

1097
01:13:20,703 --> 01:13:24,730
I really do.
The Cornwall game is tomorrow.

1098
01:13:24,873 --> 01:13:27,808
I've never had a roommate before.

1099
01:13:39,054 --> 01:13:42,751
Wow. Vi, you set up all my stuff.

1100
01:13:42,891 --> 01:13:44,882
Thanks.

1101
01:14:06,982 --> 01:14:11,419
- You're absolutely certain about this?
- Yes, sir, we are.

1102
01:14:12,221 --> 01:14:15,554
- Dude, what are you doing?!
- Sebastian, the game's about to start!

1103
01:14:15,691 --> 01:14:18,524
Get out of bed
and get over to the soccer field, man!

1104
01:14:20,529 --> 01:14:22,520
The soccer game?

1105
01:14:23,565 --> 01:14:25,624
That's what that girl was talking about.

1106
01:14:27,870 --> 01:14:30,998
Sebastian! You're next. Hurry up.

1107
01:14:31,140 --> 01:14:33,199
Come over here, and I'll do you.

1108
01:14:37,679 --> 01:14:40,341
OK, ladies, listen up.

1109
01:14:40,482 --> 01:14:41,744
Where's Hastings?

1110
01:14:48,557 --> 01:14:49,546
Euni...

1111
01:14:49,691 --> 01:14:51,716
Eunice! Why didn't you wake me?!

1112
01:14:51,860 --> 01:14:54,328
You looked so serene.

1113
01:14:56,064 --> 01:14:58,328
I made breakfast, darling.

1114
01:15:07,176 --> 01:15:10,043
Pardon me. Pardon me.

1115
01:15:15,350 --> 01:15:19,377
What is the big emergency?
I canceled my squash game for this.

1116
01:15:19,521 --> 01:15:21,989
I don't know.
All that Principal Gold said

1117
01:15:22,124 --> 01:15:25,651
was that we were needed
at Sebastian's soccer game.

1118
01:15:30,199 --> 01:15:33,225
Hasn't Viola said anything
to you the past couple of weeks?

1119
01:15:33,368 --> 01:15:35,495
How should I know?

1120
01:15:35,637 --> 01:15:38,629
She's been living with you.

1121
01:15:39,875 --> 01:15:41,706
Hasn't she?

1122
01:15:43,212 --> 01:15:45,544
- Excuse me.
- This is so exciting, guys.

1123
01:16:09,104 --> 01:16:11,004
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.

1124
01:16:11,139 --> 01:16:13,573
The biggest rivalry
in our district is afoot.

1125
01:16:13,709 --> 01:16:15,074
Illyria versus Cornwall.

1126
01:16:15,210 --> 01:16:18,111
It's gonna be something else,
and the atmosphere is crazy!

1127
01:16:20,015 --> 01:16:21,414
Afternoon, gentlemen.

1128
01:16:24,853 --> 01:16:26,514
Handshake, please.

1129
01:16:31,126 --> 01:16:33,026
All right, your call.

1130
01:16:34,263 --> 01:16:35,730
Heads.

1131
01:16:37,266 --> 01:16:38,255
Heads it is.

1132
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:40,300
We'll stay as we are.

1133
01:16:40,435 --> 01:16:43,029
Good game, gentlemen.

1134
01:16:43,171 --> 01:16:45,196
How's your jaw?

1135
01:16:52,547 --> 01:16:54,811
All right, let's get it on!

1136
01:16:54,950 --> 01:16:56,144
Way to go, boys.

1137
01:16:56,285 --> 01:16:58,583
Listen to me.
We can do this. Today is the day

1138
01:16:58,720 --> 01:17:00,517
- Cornwall beats Illyria.
- Yeah!

1139
01:17:00,656 --> 01:17:02,351
I ain't got much to say to you.

1140
01:17:02,491 --> 01:17:06,052
- Who's gonna bring blood and pain?!
- Black and red!

1141
01:17:06,194 --> 01:17:08,628
- This ain't no game. This is a war!
- Yeah!

1142
01:17:08,764 --> 01:17:10,994
Who's gonna bring that blood and pain?!

1143
01:17:11,133 --> 01:17:14,296
One, two, three! Cornwall!

1144
01:17:19,508 --> 01:17:21,169
All right, boys, here we go!

1145
01:17:31,119 --> 01:17:35,488
Hastings! Pass it off!
Pass it off! Hastings!

1146
01:17:35,624 --> 01:17:37,649
What in the hell is going on?!

1147
01:17:37,793 --> 01:17:39,522
Nice move, moron.

1148
01:17:42,864 --> 01:17:44,729
What?

1149
01:17:44,866 --> 01:17:47,027
This can't be happening.

1150
01:17:57,412 --> 01:18:00,006
Sebastian?

1151
01:18:05,587 --> 01:18:07,555
Get the ball! Get the ball!

1152
01:18:07,689 --> 01:18:09,589
Get up, get back in there!
Get the ball!

1153
01:18:09,725 --> 01:18:11,386
Oh, my God, this is my game!

1154
01:18:11,526 --> 01:18:13,619
What the hell am I doing?
This isn't fun.

1155
01:18:13,762 --> 01:18:15,423
You look like Bambi on ice, boy!

1156
01:18:15,564 --> 01:18:17,156
Sebastian!

1157
01:18:18,834 --> 01:18:19,858
Sebastian!

1158
01:18:24,439 --> 01:18:28,899
Can I get a timeout, please?
A pause? One brief halftime?

1159
01:18:29,044 --> 01:18:31,535
Stopping the clock.
That's it. Stop the clock.

1160
01:18:31,680 --> 01:18:33,238
What the?

1161
01:18:33,382 --> 01:18:35,543
I don't know the technical lingo.

1162
01:18:35,684 --> 01:18:38,244
Armadillos. Fighting Armadillos, please.

1163
01:18:38,387 --> 01:18:40,116
I need... Gather around.

1164
01:18:40,255 --> 01:18:42,450
I played soccer as a young man.
Was it chess?

1165
01:18:42,591 --> 01:18:46,322
- Is there a problem, principal?
- Yes. Unfortunately there is.

1166
01:18:46,461 --> 01:18:51,489
But I think it's only right that
Sebastian Hastings tell you himself.

1167
01:18:51,633 --> 01:18:55,069
Sebastian? Son? Or...

1168
01:18:55,203 --> 01:18:57,603
Do you have anything you'd like to say?

1169
01:19:00,709 --> 01:19:03,644
I'm sorry I'm not
a very good soccer player.

1170
01:19:05,480 --> 01:19:07,004
I see.

1171
01:19:07,149 --> 01:19:11,108
Well then,
please know that what I say,

1172
01:19:11,253 --> 01:19:13,653
I say with a heavy heart.

1173
01:19:18,326 --> 01:19:20,794
Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed alumni,

1174
01:19:20,929 --> 01:19:23,193
friends and family
of Sebastian Hastings,

1175
01:19:23,331 --> 01:19:25,299
I am grievously sad...

1176
01:19:25,434 --> 01:19:29,131
...to inform you that Sebastian Hastings

1177
01:19:29,271 --> 01:19:31,569
is... a girl.

1178
01:19:32,908 --> 01:19:35,968
Sorry, it's for your own good.
You'll thank me for it someday.

1179
01:19:36,111 --> 01:19:37,305
Oh, OK. Certainly. Yes.

1180
01:19:37,446 --> 01:19:41,348
Excuse me. I'm not a girl.

1181
01:19:41,483 --> 01:19:42,711
Hello! Yes.

1182
01:19:42,851 --> 01:19:44,785
In fact, yes, he is. He's a big girl.

1183
01:19:44,920 --> 01:19:47,616
He's actually specifically
his own sister, Viola,

1184
01:19:47,756 --> 01:19:51,715
who's been impersonating him
for reasons which will become very clear

1185
01:19:51,860 --> 01:19:53,794
after extensive psychoanalysis.

1186
01:19:53,929 --> 01:19:56,227
Folks.

1187
01:19:56,364 --> 01:19:59,333
I'm a boy. I promise.

1188
01:19:59,468 --> 01:20:02,995
- Prove it.
- OK.

1189
01:20:05,607 --> 01:20:06,631
God! I saw it.

1190
01:20:06,775 --> 01:20:09,209
Nice work, Paul. Wow.

1191
01:20:09,344 --> 01:20:11,073
That's my boy.

1192
01:20:11,213 --> 01:20:12,737
Kevin, close your eyes.

1193
01:20:12,881 --> 01:20:15,349
Soccer is the world's favorite sport.

1194
01:20:15,484 --> 01:20:16,917
Thank you. Thank you.

1195
01:20:17,052 --> 01:20:19,816
Nothing to see here. No offense.

1196
01:20:19,955 --> 01:20:22,515
Folks, please, hang on for one second.

1197
01:20:22,657 --> 01:20:25,023
Just talk amongst yourselves
for a second.

1198
01:20:26,361 --> 01:20:28,761
Malcolm!

1199
01:20:28,897 --> 01:20:32,731
Can you shed some light
on the current situation?

1200
01:20:34,669 --> 01:20:38,105
Not any more
than has already been shed, sir.

1201
01:20:38,240 --> 01:20:40,868
OK, lads, listen up now.

1202
01:20:41,009 --> 01:20:44,206
Now that we've established this boy...

1203
01:20:44,346 --> 01:20:45,938
...is a boy...

1204
01:20:46,081 --> 01:20:48,447
...is it possible
we can get back to our game?

1205
01:20:50,919 --> 01:20:54,286
Yes. Enjoy. That was a skit we...

1206
01:20:54,422 --> 01:20:55,889
OK. Yes.

1207
01:20:56,024 --> 01:20:57,548
Let's get to it, guys. Come on.

1208
01:20:57,692 --> 01:21:00,126
- I know, let's play.
- Waste of time.

1209
01:21:00,262 --> 01:21:05,427
Baby. Baby, baby, baby.
I have missed you so much.

1210
01:21:05,567 --> 01:21:07,364
Oh, my God, we are both so dead.

1211
01:21:07,502 --> 01:21:11,370
We're over, Monique. Done.

1212
01:21:12,707 --> 01:21:15,403
God! Not again!

1213
01:21:21,049 --> 01:21:23,108
Good work, Hastings.

1214
01:21:23,251 --> 01:21:24,411
Bench.

1215
01:21:38,300 --> 01:21:39,631
Good one!

1216
01:21:42,404 --> 01:21:43,837
Halftime, gentlemen.

1217
01:22:04,726 --> 01:22:06,387
Sebastian!

1218
01:22:06,528 --> 01:22:08,052
- Vi?
- Yes.

1219
01:22:08,196 --> 01:22:09,390
Why do you look like me?!

1220
01:22:09,531 --> 01:22:11,396
I pretended to be you
the last two weeks

1221
01:22:11,533 --> 01:22:13,728
to prove I could play
in the boys soccer team.

1222
01:22:13,868 --> 01:22:15,893
- Yes.
- OK. OK, cool.

1223
01:22:16,037 --> 01:22:18,369
- No, wait! What?!
- I don't have time to explain!

1224
01:22:18,506 --> 01:22:20,337
Why are you wearing my uniform?

1225
01:22:20,475 --> 01:22:22,841
I came to find the girl
that kissed me last night.

1226
01:22:22,978 --> 01:22:26,436
- Who kissed you? What girl?
- Check it out. That one.

1227
01:22:26,581 --> 01:22:28,378
Olivia?

1228
01:22:28,516 --> 01:22:31,508
She was all over me. She kissed me
and recited my own lyrics.

1229
01:22:31,653 --> 01:22:34,019
Vi, this may be the girl of my dreams.

1230
01:22:34,155 --> 01:22:35,816
That's the kiss that Duke saw.

1231
01:22:35,957 --> 01:22:37,151
Wait, are those real?

1232
01:22:37,292 --> 01:22:38,850
Yeah. I'm growing sideburns.

1233
01:22:38,994 --> 01:22:41,326
No! Please stay hidden
until the end of the game.

1234
01:22:41,463 --> 01:22:44,023
And give me my uniform back right now!

1235
01:22:52,073 --> 01:22:54,371
We start the second half.

1236
01:22:54,509 --> 01:22:58,240
Illyria, zero, Cornwall, zero.
Nothing but a couple of goose eggs.

1237
01:22:58,380 --> 01:23:01,679
- Coach, I'm ready to play.
- Is that what you call it?

1238
01:23:01,816 --> 01:23:04,512
I've seen little girls in tutus
kick the ball better.

1239
01:23:04,653 --> 01:23:06,314
I've changed.

1240
01:23:06,454 --> 01:23:09,048
Come on, coach,
give me one more chance.

1241
01:23:09,190 --> 01:23:10,714
All right. Go.

1242
01:23:10,859 --> 01:23:12,224
Kick. Kill!

1243
01:23:25,874 --> 01:23:27,341
Yeah! Now that's Viola!

1244
01:23:43,024 --> 01:23:45,049
You couldn't score on me
in the first half.

1245
01:23:45,193 --> 01:23:48,856
You ain't going to score on me this
half, baby! I'm ninja! Ninja goalie!

1246
01:24:00,342 --> 01:24:01,604
Come on, guys!

1247
01:24:41,149 --> 01:24:44,141
Duke! Duke! I'm open!

1248
01:24:44,285 --> 01:24:47,846
Give me the ball! Duke! Hey, over here!

1249
01:24:47,989 --> 01:24:49,957
I'm open!

1250
01:24:51,292 --> 01:24:55,058
Duke! Get back! Get back!

1251
01:24:59,567 --> 01:25:01,000
No!

1252
01:25:01,136 --> 01:25:04,037
Yes, Dan-O, way to go, baby!

1253
01:25:08,977 --> 01:25:10,945
Cornwall's right back in it with a goal.

1254
01:25:20,321 --> 01:25:24,052
- What's the matter?! Sebastian's open!
- Rather lose the goal?!

1255
01:25:24,192 --> 01:25:25,352
Shut up, man.

1256
01:25:25,493 --> 01:25:27,518
Duke, I know you're mad at me.

1257
01:25:27,662 --> 01:25:30,563
Don't talk to me. Get out of my face!

1258
01:25:30,698 --> 01:25:34,259
Nothing is going on with me and Olivia!
When the game is over I'll explain!

1259
01:25:34,402 --> 01:25:37,701
For right now, you don't have
to like me, but I'm your teammate, OK?!

1260
01:25:37,839 --> 01:25:40,364
I want to beat these guys!
I have to beat these guys!

1261
01:25:40,508 --> 01:25:43,705
If we're not disturbing you,
we have a soccer game to finish.

1262
01:25:43,845 --> 01:25:45,176
Get back in the net, man.

1263
01:25:45,313 --> 01:25:47,372
Or you'll hit my fist
with your face again?

1264
01:25:47,515 --> 01:25:49,506
Do you want to see me do it? Let's go!

1265
01:25:49,651 --> 01:25:50,913
Duke, come on. Stop it.

1266
01:25:51,052 --> 01:25:52,747
- Come on!
- Duke, stop it.

1267
01:25:56,357 --> 01:25:59,417
Sebastian!

1268
01:25:59,561 --> 01:26:01,722
Duke! Stop it!

1269
01:26:01,863 --> 01:26:03,558
Come on!

1270
01:26:04,532 --> 01:26:05,863
OK!

1271
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,366
Stop it! Oh, my God!

1272
01:26:08,503 --> 01:26:11,267
If you want to roughhouse,
take it at least 500 yards

1273
01:26:11,406 --> 01:26:14,204
- away from the stadium grounds.
- Break it up! Break it up!

1274
01:26:15,510 --> 01:26:17,569
OK, tough guys.

1275
01:26:17,712 --> 01:26:21,478
You want to box?
You get out of my stadium.

1276
01:26:21,616 --> 01:26:23,413
Otherwise, get on with the game.

1277
01:26:23,551 --> 01:26:25,678
Come on, now, Armadillos of Illyria.

1278
01:26:25,820 --> 01:26:27,651
That goes for the rest of you!

1279
01:26:27,789 --> 01:26:31,054
Now get on
and play some real football!

1280
01:26:31,192 --> 01:26:33,990
- Like a bunch of girls.
- OK.

1281
01:26:34,128 --> 01:26:38,724
The rest of you, let's play some
real football like a bunch of girls.

1282
01:26:38,867 --> 01:26:40,767
- All right?
- You suck!

1283
01:26:40,902 --> 01:26:44,269
It's not football, it's soccer.
That's what we call it in the States.

1284
01:26:44,405 --> 01:26:48,102
- Sebastian! Are you OK?
- No, Olivia, Not now.

1285
01:26:48,243 --> 01:26:50,609
Try to tell me again
there's nothing going on.

1286
01:26:50,745 --> 01:26:52,406
There is nothing going on!

1287
01:26:52,547 --> 01:26:56,574
- What about last night?
- I didn't lie to you, Duke.

1288
01:26:56,718 --> 01:26:59,312
I did, but not about this.

1289
01:27:01,022 --> 01:27:02,319
Here's the truth.

1290
01:27:03,825 --> 01:27:05,087
I love you.

1291
01:27:06,060 --> 01:27:07,049
I beg your pardon?

1292
01:27:07,195 --> 01:27:11,256
What? All right... What're you?
That's just a little weird.

1293
01:27:11,399 --> 01:27:14,391
OK, you know what?
I can't do this anymore.

1294
01:27:14,536 --> 01:27:17,164
Everybody, I have something to tell you.

1295
01:27:18,039 --> 01:27:20,803
I'm not Sebastian.

1296
01:27:20,942 --> 01:27:21,931
I'm Viola.

1297
01:27:22,076 --> 01:27:24,271
Wait. You're not Viola.

1298
01:27:24,412 --> 01:27:26,937
- Yes, I am.
- No, I know Viola.

1299
01:27:27,081 --> 01:27:29,572
- I... I kissed Viola.
- You kissed me.

1300
01:27:29,717 --> 01:27:33,813
What are you talking about?
I didn't kiss you.

1301
01:27:33,955 --> 01:27:37,550
The girls team at Cornwall got cut.

1302
01:27:37,692 --> 01:27:40,855
The guys wouldn't let me
go out for their team.

1303
01:27:40,995 --> 01:27:44,362
So I've been pretending
to be my brother

1304
01:27:44,499 --> 01:27:48,595
while he was in London
for the past two weeks...

1305
01:27:48,736 --> 01:27:52,934
...so I could make the team
and beat Cornwall.

1306
01:27:58,680 --> 01:28:01,046
But my brother came home early.

1307
01:28:01,182 --> 01:28:06,119
And that's who you saw kissing Olivia
and that's who played the first half.

1308
01:28:06,254 --> 01:28:08,779
Because you wear a wig
doesn't prove you're a girl.

1309
01:28:08,923 --> 01:28:11,187
OK, then.

1310
01:28:13,194 --> 01:28:15,287
Merciful Jesus.

1311
01:28:15,430 --> 01:28:16,988
Yeah!

1312
01:28:17,131 --> 01:28:18,962
- Viola?!
- Is it just me

1313
01:28:19,100 --> 01:28:21,568
or this soccer game
have more nudity than most?

1314
01:28:21,703 --> 01:28:23,694
All right, so everybody understand?

1315
01:28:23,838 --> 01:28:25,806
- Yeah. I get it.
- OK.

1316
01:28:25,940 --> 01:28:28,909
Wait a minute. If I kissed your brother,
where is he?

1317
01:28:29,043 --> 01:28:32,638
Probably halfway to China. He
showed his willis and doodleberries...

1318
01:28:32,780 --> 01:28:34,304
- Present.
- Hi.

1319
01:28:34,449 --> 01:28:36,383
What the?

1320
01:28:36,517 --> 01:28:38,712
OK, this is freaking me out.

1321
01:28:39,821 --> 01:28:43,348
Ladies and gentlemen, I hate
to say "I told you so," but I just...

1322
01:28:44,492 --> 01:28:46,619
See, Duke? I didn't betray you.

1323
01:28:48,529 --> 01:28:49,655
I'm sorry.

1324
01:28:49,797 --> 01:28:53,597
This isn't how I wanted it to happen,
and I didn't want to hurt you.

1325
01:28:53,735 --> 01:28:58,365
But I just wanted to prove
that I was good enough.

1326
01:28:58,506 --> 01:29:00,599
All I'm asking for is a chance.

1327
01:29:05,079 --> 01:29:07,047
Duke?

1328
01:29:12,553 --> 01:29:15,283
It's just like what coach says
before every game:

1329
01:29:17,125 --> 01:29:20,754
"Be not afraid of greatness.

1330
01:29:20,895 --> 01:29:24,296
Some are born great.
Some achieve greatness.

1331
01:29:24,432 --> 01:29:29,426
And some have greatness
thrust upon them."

1332
01:29:29,570 --> 01:29:33,472
I think the best chance for us to be
great here today is to have you play.

1333
01:29:33,608 --> 01:29:36,076
- Yeah!
- All right!

1334
01:29:36,210 --> 01:29:39,941
Yeah! Yeah! No!

1335
01:29:40,081 --> 01:29:41,412
No playing!

1336
01:29:41,549 --> 01:29:42,777
You have to forfeit.

1337
01:29:42,917 --> 01:29:45,545
There's no girls in this league.
Look in the manual.

1338
01:29:48,189 --> 01:29:49,417
What manual?

1339
01:29:49,557 --> 01:29:52,526
Listen, pal. You're in Illyria.

1340
01:29:52,660 --> 01:29:57,427
We don't discriminate based on gender.

1341
01:29:57,565 --> 01:29:59,430
All right.

1342
01:29:59,567 --> 01:30:01,865
That's gonna bruise.

1343
01:30:02,003 --> 01:30:07,168
Fine. You really think you can beat us
with a girl on your team?

1344
01:30:07,308 --> 01:30:09,606
This should be fun.

1345
01:30:09,744 --> 01:30:11,211
Go.

1346
01:30:11,345 --> 01:30:13,779
I get to say the last word, not you. Go.

1347
01:30:16,317 --> 01:30:17,944
OK, team...

1348
01:30:18,086 --> 01:30:21,419
...let's go kick! Kill!
- Yeah!

1349
01:30:21,556 --> 01:30:23,251
Come on! Come on!

1350
01:30:23,391 --> 01:30:25,951
Well, folks, this is a real nail-biter.

1351
01:30:26,094 --> 01:30:29,086
It's a tie score at the bottom
of the second half.

1352
01:31:00,194 --> 01:31:02,025
Come on, come on! Open up!

1353
01:31:18,212 --> 01:31:19,201
What?

1354
01:31:19,347 --> 01:31:23,147
Foul? That's not a foul!
He got all ball!

1355
01:31:29,157 --> 01:31:31,455
And the penalty kick
will decide the game.

1356
01:31:39,700 --> 01:31:43,727
Where you gonna kick it? Right here?
I know you're gonna kick it there.

1357
01:31:43,871 --> 01:31:45,532
Am I in your head? Am I in your head?

1358
01:31:45,673 --> 01:31:49,200
You see the goal? It's getting
smaller and I'm getting bigger.

1359
01:31:49,343 --> 01:31:50,332
Come on.

1360
01:31:50,478 --> 01:31:52,469
I love you.

1361
01:31:52,613 --> 01:31:55,241
Concentrate. Don't kick like a girl.

1362
01:31:55,383 --> 01:31:57,943
Guys are better. It's not gonna happen.

1363
01:31:58,085 --> 01:31:59,985
You're a loser! This is my house!

1364
01:32:00,121 --> 01:32:02,612
You're pathetic! I'm in your head.

1365
01:32:16,003 --> 01:32:18,198
Yeah!

1366
01:32:19,740 --> 01:32:23,005
- That's my girl!
- Mine too!

1367
01:32:34,222 --> 01:32:37,020
It's not fair! It's not fair!

1368
01:32:37,158 --> 01:32:38,887
That was a lucky shot!

1369
01:32:39,026 --> 01:32:42,962
I never wanna see you again! You suck!

1370
01:32:50,271 --> 01:32:52,933
- You did it, Vi!
- You were so awesome!

1371
01:32:53,074 --> 01:32:55,770
- I am so proud of you.
- It's over.

1372
01:32:55,910 --> 01:32:58,401
You scored the game-winning goal.
Say something.

1373
01:32:58,546 --> 01:33:00,878
Mom? Dad?

1374
01:33:03,384 --> 01:33:05,716
- That was really something.
- Thanks, Dad.

1375
01:33:05,853 --> 01:33:09,482
- You did all this to play soccer?
- I told you, it's important to me.

1376
01:33:09,624 --> 01:33:13,287
If Viola was here pretending to be you,

1377
01:33:13,427 --> 01:33:15,361
- where were you?
- Oh, he was...

1378
01:33:15,496 --> 01:33:17,361
I was in London playing my music.

1379
01:33:17,498 --> 01:33:20,296
- London?
- It was important to me.

1380
01:33:20,434 --> 01:33:22,902
- You should call before you...
- How did you?

1381
01:33:23,037 --> 01:33:25,369
Mom, Dad... Hey!

1382
01:33:25,506 --> 01:33:29,602
Why don't we go to dinner? As a family?

1383
01:33:29,744 --> 01:33:32,907
- Maybe tomorrow?
- I suppose I could fit that in.

1384
01:33:33,047 --> 01:33:35,413
Would you like
to have my cell phone number?

1385
01:33:35,549 --> 01:33:37,608
- Let me give you my e-mail.
- All right.

1386
01:33:37,752 --> 01:33:39,185
Yay!

1387
01:33:39,320 --> 01:33:41,083
- Good job.
- Thank you.

1388
01:33:41,222 --> 01:33:44,385
Oh, wait! There is somebody
I want you to officially meet.

1389
01:33:44,525 --> 01:33:47,858
Sebastian Hastings, Olivia Lennox.

1390
01:33:49,997 --> 01:33:52,329
- It's very nice to meet you.
- You too.

1391
01:33:52,466 --> 01:33:55,731
So I heard you like my lyrics.

1392
01:33:58,372 --> 01:34:01,864
- Eunice?
- Toby?

1393
01:34:04,779 --> 01:34:07,270
I have something to say.

1394
01:34:07,415 --> 01:34:09,940
I think you are...

1395
01:34:10,084 --> 01:34:12,609
...amazing.

1396
01:34:13,854 --> 01:34:16,118
And I'm not ashamed of it.

1397
01:34:19,660 --> 01:34:21,855
I know tricks.

1398
01:34:21,996 --> 01:34:23,987
Oh, Eunice.

1399
01:34:59,467 --> 01:35:02,129
Hey, roomie.

1400
01:35:02,269 --> 01:35:04,897
This is for you.

1401
01:35:27,194 --> 01:35:30,095
"The Stratford Junior League invites you

1402
01:35:30,231 --> 01:35:34,099
to the 38th Annual Debutante Ball."

1403
01:35:36,270 --> 01:35:40,001
- He still could show, you know.
- You didn't see his face.

1404
01:35:40,141 --> 01:35:42,336
I found the perfect dress.

1405
01:35:42,476 --> 01:35:46,344
Thanks, Mom, but I don't think
I'm gonna get a chance to wear it.

1406
01:35:46,480 --> 01:35:47,572
Nonsense.

1407
01:35:47,715 --> 01:35:51,708
You don't need a man
to wear a beautiful dress.

1408
01:35:52,686 --> 01:35:54,677
But it doesn't hurt.

1409
01:35:54,822 --> 01:35:59,282
Viola Hastings, it would be
my honor to escort you tonight.

1410
01:35:59,427 --> 01:36:01,327
Thanks, Paul. That's really sweet.

1411
01:36:01,462 --> 01:36:04,022
Caterpillars! My precious caterpillars.

1412
01:36:04,165 --> 01:36:07,157
In 20 minutes
you'll all be beautiful butterflies.

1413
01:36:07,301 --> 01:36:10,361
- Caterpillars!
- Butterflies!

1414
01:36:10,504 --> 01:36:14,201
You look beautiful.
I just... I gotta get some air.

1415
01:36:46,240 --> 01:36:47,935
I didn't think you'd show up.

1416
01:36:50,010 --> 01:36:52,478
It really means a lot to me
that you're here.

1417
01:36:54,648 --> 01:36:57,674
- Say something.
- I gotta turn the sprinklers on.

1418
01:37:00,254 --> 01:37:02,119
Sorry.

1419
01:37:10,131 --> 01:37:13,123
- Hi.
- Hi.

1420
01:37:13,267 --> 01:37:16,293
So, what brings you here?

1421
01:37:17,671 --> 01:37:20,105
Well, a few days ago,

1422
01:37:20,241 --> 01:37:23,506
I kissed this girl at a kissing booth.

1423
01:37:25,045 --> 01:37:29,812
And now I just can't seem
to stop thinking about it.

1424
01:37:30,684 --> 01:37:32,584
Neither can she.

1425
01:37:32,720 --> 01:37:37,089
Plus, I miss my roommate.

1426
01:37:37,224 --> 01:37:39,488
I really liked him.

1427
01:37:40,628 --> 01:37:43,062
Well...

1428
01:37:43,197 --> 01:37:44,824
...he's right in here.

1429
01:37:46,100 --> 01:37:51,402
Listen, I know I should've
told you who I was, but...

1430
01:37:51,539 --> 01:37:52,801
...I was afraid.

1431
01:37:55,176 --> 01:37:58,407
- Sorry.
- Well,

1432
01:37:58,546 --> 01:38:01,014
you know, maybe
if I'd have known you were a girl,

1433
01:38:01,148 --> 01:38:03,514
we wouldn't have talked like we did

1434
01:38:03,651 --> 01:38:06,848
and got to know each other
the same way.

1435
01:38:06,987 --> 01:38:08,648
And that would have been a shame.

1436
01:38:10,824 --> 01:38:13,292
Just so you know,

1437
01:38:13,427 --> 01:38:17,864
everything you told me
when I was a guy just...

1438
01:38:17,998 --> 01:38:21,866
...made me like you
so much more as a girl.

1439
01:38:22,002 --> 01:38:25,028
OK, but just from here on in,

1440
01:38:25,172 --> 01:38:27,868
everything would just be a lot easier

1441
01:38:28,008 --> 01:38:31,375
if you stayed a girl.

1442
01:38:31,512 --> 01:38:33,639
I promise.

1443
01:38:33,781 --> 01:38:39,014
Monique Valentine,
escorted by Justin Drayton.

1444
01:38:48,028 --> 01:38:49,427
Justin, you're the man!

1445
01:38:56,437 --> 01:39:00,999
Olivia Lennox,
escorted by Sebastian Hastings.

1446
01:39:07,982 --> 01:39:13,784
Viola Hastings,
escorted by Paul Antonio.

1447
01:39:18,592 --> 01:39:21,026
Viola Hastings.

1448
01:39:23,264 --> 01:39:25,994
This is typical. Well, where is she?
