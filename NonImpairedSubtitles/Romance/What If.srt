your opinion on something.

- CHANTRY: Yes, it is a cont...

- BEN: Is it a continent?
- It is.

He is from that continent,
he should know.

344
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:24,420
Okay, look at a map, any map,

345
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,964
Europe's not a separate continent,
it's clearly part of Asia.

346
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:32,053
Right. But, wait, so if Europe isn't
a continent, then why is it a continent?

347
00:18:32,153 --> 00:18:34,972
Because Europeans were the ones
who decided what the continents are,

348
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:39,101
and they didn't want to get lumped
in with all the, you know, Asians.

Okay? Eurasia.
That's what they should call it.

351
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:48,486

And so, um, Ben, what is it
exactly that you do at the UN?

355

to sleep with my girlfriend?

CHANTRY: Ben was working
late and Allan invited me...

Uh, don't worry,
we're just talking "guy," okay?

360

They think we're talking about
international copyright law.

Okay.

Now, look, I have no problem with the
concept of Chantry having guy friends,

- Okay.
- Every country has different laws,

369

think it's important work, you know?

00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:38,007
and one in college before Ben,
and then Ben.

767
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:39,975
- You?
- Six?

768
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:42,637
One in high school, one the
summer after high school,

769
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:44,681
three in college, and one since.

770
00:38:44,781 --> 00:38:46,808
No, sorry, two since. So seven.

771
00:38:46,908 --> 00:38:48,393
Are you usually the dumper or dumpee?

772
00:38:48,493 --> 00:38:52,522
Um, statistically, I'm a dumper,
but it's not like I've never been dumped.

773
00:38:52,622 --> 00:38:54,858
I've just been really good
at knowing when to get out.

774
00:38:54,958 --> 00:38:57,902
- You?
- No, I've never dumped anyone.

775
00:38:58,002 --> 00:39:00,279
I always try to make it work.

776
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:04,200
You know, I haven't hit the bar
scene in, like, a very long time.

777
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:07,328
I thought it was gonna be the worst,
but that was surprisingly painless.

778
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:09,581
I'm just sorry you didn't
find true love tonight.

779
00:39:09,681 --> 00:39:11,833
Ah, well, you can't have it all.

780
00:39:11,933 --> 00:39:15,212
And what's the worst thing
that's ever happened to you?

781
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,380
Um, the worst thing that's
ever happened to me

782
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:20,550
is kind of the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

783
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:22,719
Megan, you met the other day,

784
00:39:22,819 --> 00:39:28,308
I burst in on her making out with our,
frankly, gross anatomy professor,

785
00:39:28,408 --> 00:39:33,814
and I was like, "Wow,
we actually are my parents.

786
00:39:34,122 --> 00:39:35,857
We are almost both doctors,

787
00:39:35,957 --> 00:39:38,818
and we already started
cheating on each other."

788
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:42,030
So I got out of there, and yeah.

789
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:43,656
So, in a way, that became

790
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:45,867
the best thing that
ever happened to me.

791
00:39:45,967 --> 00:39:49,962
So, what is the worst thing
that ever happened to you?

792
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:55,084
My mom died when I
was in junior high.

793
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:57,253
Um...

794
00:39:57,353 --> 00:40:00,051
She had breast cancer.

795
00:40:01,441 --> 00:40:06,847
You don't realize how quickly everything
can fall apart until it does.

796
00:40:07,447 --> 00:40:11,693
Makes you never want to give
up anything good ever again.

797
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:16,105
Can I change my answer?

798
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:17,774
The worst thing that happened to me

799
00:40:17,874 --> 00:40:19,567
is saying my lame relationship drama

800
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:21,277
is the worst thing
that happened to me,

801
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:23,530
when something really
awful happened to you.

802
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:25,156
It's okay.

803
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:27,450
I like your answer.

804
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,994
Plus, I get to be part of the
worst part of your life now.

805
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:31,746
That's really good.

806
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:33,832
And for future reference,
when the answer is

807
00:40:33,932 --> 00:40:36,960
your mom died of cancer,
you should really go first.

808
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:40,171
All right. Thanks for
the etiquette lesson.

809
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:42,423
No worries.

810
00:40:42,649 --> 00:40:44,767
Good night, Wallace.

811
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:47,102
Good night, Chantry.

812
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:58,815
CHANTRY: You know, he has
all these new experiences,

813
00:40:58,915 --> 00:41:00,859
he's meeting all these new people.

814
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:02,443
And then, "What's going on with you?"

815
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:05,697
And it's like, "Well, I'm in the
middle of my same old life,

816
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:07,907
except, whoops, my boyfriend's
out of the country."

817
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:09,117
TABBY: Ugh!

818
00:41:09,217 --> 00:41:12,040
So Dolly was telling us
about this Wallace guy...?

819
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:13,663
We're friends.

820
00:41:13,763 --> 00:41:17,333
Well, no, I know, obviously you
guys are friends, but is he cute?

821
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:18,751
Should you be introducing him

822
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:20,712
to your single,
desperate friends like me?

823
00:41:20,812 --> 00:41:23,131
No, no, I already called dibs on him.

824
00:41:23,231 --> 00:41:24,340
Why?

825
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:27,385
He was supposed to be my rebound.
That's why it didn't work with Noel.

826
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:29,304
I needed a buffer
between Rob and Noel.

827
00:41:29,404 --> 00:41:30,763
A buffer made of sex.

828
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:33,308
GRETCHEN: You little prostitute.

829
00:41:33,408 --> 00:41:35,768
- Dalia, you barely know him.
- DALIA: Well, you know him.

830
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:38,104
You hang out with him all
the time, so he's not a loser.

831
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:39,689
He hasn't made some
creepy move on you,

832
00:41:39,789 --> 00:41:41,983
so we know he's not a creep.
He's vetted.

833
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:45,028
TABBY: Well, is he funny or smart?

834
00:41:45,128 --> 00:41:47,196
He's definitely smart.
He's not funny.

835
00:41:47,296 --> 00:41:49,240
He's, like, kind of, like, bantery.

836
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,618
He's kind of like a male
version of Chantry, actually.

837
00:41:51,718 --> 00:41:53,578
- Oh, wait, so he's Mantry?
- TABBY: Oh, no.

838
00:41:53,678 --> 00:41:56,289
- DALIA: Yes, he is. He's totally Mantry.
- No. No, We're not...

839
00:41:56,389 --> 00:41:58,791
TABBY: Dalia wants to have rebound
sex with her sister's man-twin.

840
00:41:58,891 --> 00:42:00,877
ALLAN:
Option one, make a move on her.

841
00:42:00,977 --> 00:42:02,712
Bold, direct.

842
00:42:02,812 --> 00:42:05,506
If you're lucky, you hook up,
she feels guilty, breaks up with Ben.

843
00:42:05,606 --> 00:42:07,842
If you're unlucky, she's furious,
ends your friendship.

844
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:09,218
- So be sleazy?
- Yeah.

845
00:42:09,318 --> 00:42:11,012
- WALLACE: You think that'll work?
- ALLAN: No.

846
00:42:11,112 --> 00:42:14,057
Even if she goes for it, she'll
resent you for getting her to cheat.

847
00:42:14,157 --> 00:42:16,184
She'll break up with him, but she won't
go out with you because you're...

848
00:42:16,284 --> 00:42:17,393
- Sleazy.
- Yeah.

849
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:20,605
Option two, be the guy
she goes to for advice.

850
00:42:20,705 --> 00:42:23,191
The downside is you have to
listen to her talk about Ben.

851
00:42:23,291 --> 00:42:26,152
The upside is you can slant your
advice to slowly turn her against him.

852
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:27,362
- So be conniving?
- Yeah.

853
00:42:27,462 --> 00:42:28,821
- And that'll work?
- Maybe.

854
00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:30,490
Maybe she'll see through
it and think you're...

855
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:31,699
- Conniving?
- Yeah.

856
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:34,827
Option three, patiently wait it out.

857
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:37,163
Either the distance gets
to them and they break up,

858
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:40,416
or it doesn't, and they get married,
live a happy life,

859
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:45,338
with you always on the outside,
looking in, quietly pining indefinitely.

860
00:42:45,438 --> 00:42:47,215
- So be pathetic?
- Yeah.

861
00:42:47,315 --> 00:42:48,424
That sounds fun.

862
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:50,760
It's got the advantage
of not being unethical,

863
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:52,261
but the disadvantage of being...

864
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:53,554
- Pathetic.
- Yeah.

865
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:57,775
So your advice is be sleazy,
conniving or pathetic.

866
00:42:58,785 --> 00:43:02,563
Well, when you put it that way,
it doesn't sound like very good advice.

Um, well, it's not

Then you're made for each other.

Look, you just, like...

You don't have the greatest
track record with guys. That's all.

878
00:43:27,647 --> 00:43:29,716
You think I'm gonna break his heart
and mess up your friendship?

00:43:29,816 --> 00:43:30,925
No.

880

So you think I'm not
good enough for him?

881
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:35,430
Obviously not.
That's obviously not what it is.

882
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:37,432
Some of us aren't as
lucky as you and Ben.

883
00:43:37,532 --> 00:43:40,143
Some of us want a guy that
doesn't make us feel like crap.

884
00:43:40,243 --> 00:43:41,352
There is a fourth option.

885
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:42,687
- Yeah?
- Be honest.

886
00:43:42,787 --> 00:43:44,022
Tell her how you feel.

887
00:43:44,122 --> 00:43:46,274
It might ruin the friendship,
but at least you

888
00:43:46,374 --> 00:43:48,651
stood up like a man and
expressed your feelings.

889
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:51,320
Wait, I'm sorry.
Since when does being a man

890
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:53,072
involve expressing your feelings?

891
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:54,782
Did I miss a memo?
Because if I recall,

892
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:57,160
being a man meant hiding
your feelings forever.

893
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:59,912
Like Bruce Willis. You never see
Bruce Willis expressing feelings.

894
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:02,331
The most you ever get out of
Bruce is a hint of melancholy

895
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:04,292
- at the edge of a smirk.
- Do you think Bruce

00:44:04,392 --> 00:44:07,003
would be happy just being friends?

897
00:44:07,103 --> 00:44:10,006
A hundred percent honesty is the
foundation of any relationship.

898
00:44:10,106 --> 00:44:11,924
You are a hundred percent
honest with Nicole?

Yeah, she did look like
a woman, to be fair.

903
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:22,101
Ninety-nine percent honesty is the
foundation of any relationship.

904
00:44:22,201 --> 00:44:25,813
You know, it's not worth the risk,
not if it means losing her as a friend.

01:29:41,751 --> 01:29:43,236
- From the waist down?
- Yeah.

1678
01:29:43,336 --> 01:29:45,614
So everything would still work
down there, though, right?

1679
01:29:45,714 --> 01:29:48,200
Yeah. I mean, I wouldn't be
able to feel anything, but...

1680
01:29:48,300 --> 01:29:50,452
I really don't even need
you to feel anything now.

1681
01:29:50,552 --> 01:29:51,912
I don't want the sex to be too good

1682
01:29:52,012 --> 01:29:53,121
- right away.
- Mm-hm.

1683
01:29:53,221 --> 01:29:55,665
I'm intentionally being much
worse in bed than I actually am

1684
01:29:55,765 --> 01:29:57,751
so that it can just keep
getting better forever.

1685
01:29:57,851 --> 01:30:00,629
But, like, very slowly,
over many, many decades

1686
01:30:00,729 --> 01:30:02,547
so that we hit our
sexual peak in our 90s.

1687
01:30:02,647 --> 01:30:04,591
Yeah. That's the plan, actually,

1688
01:30:04,691 --> 01:30:10,847
is if the last time we have sex is also
the best and that it actually kills you.

1689
01:30:10,947 --> 01:30:13,145
That wouldn't be such
a bad way to go.

1690
01:30:14,492 --> 01:30:18,362
- We should head back soon, right?
- Yes.

1691
01:30:19,205 --> 01:30:22,609
Or we could stay here
for another minute.

1692
01:30:23,793 --> 01:30:26,616
Or maybe like forever.
