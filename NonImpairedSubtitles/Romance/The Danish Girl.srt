Flaunting her ankles.

I don't think anyone is likely to
be corrupted by seeing my ankles.

It was the first time we met,
I was leaving the Academy

207

and she was sitting on the steps,
flaunting said ankles.

And she propositioned me.

Is that true?

210
00:16:59,344 --> 00:17:01,804
When I said hello to him,
he actually blushed.

211
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:06,600
He was so shy, so I asked him out.

212

I kissed him.

He's lost his way.

672
01:00:07,474 --> 01:00:09,104
He's not working.

673
01:00:09,184 --> 01:00:12,524
He needs someone to represent him,
someone who knows him.

674
01:00:15,774 --> 01:00:17,284
He needs a friend.

675
01:00:30,539 --> 01:00:32,669
GERDA: I have a new dealer
coming over later.

676
01:00:33,458 --> 01:00:34,918
I'd like you to meet him.

677
01:00:36,586 --> 01:00:38,756
I don't want a new dealer.

678
01:00:38,964 --> 01:00:41,844
It doesn't make sense to me.
I'm hardly working.

679
01:00:41,925 --> 01:00:43,505
That might change.

680
01:00:44,469 --> 01:00:45,929
I don't think so.

681
01:00:46,096 --> 01:00:47,926
I'm happy helping you.

682
01:00:48,056 --> 01:00:49,056
(HAMMERING)

683
01:00:49,099 --> 01:00:50,479
It's Hans Axgil.

684
01:00:52,436 --> 01:00:56,106
Dinner at La Dauphine at 8:00,
then back here to see the paintings.

685
01:00:57,107 --> 01:00:59,777
He remembers you with great fondness.

686
01:01:12,539 --> 01:01:14,499
It was handmade,
and I've had it since I was four.

687
01:01:14,541 --> 01:01:17,841
You know, Einar's still stricken with guilt
about crashing your kite.

688
01:01:18,045 --> 01:01:20,055
My kite? I'll tease him about that.

689
01:01:20,797 --> 01:01:23,627
No, it's too cruel.

690
01:01:23,675 --> 01:01:26,135
Well, if he ever gets here.
Perhaps he doesn't want to see me.

691
01:01:26,511 --> 01:01:29,601
No. No, it's not that.

692
01:01:32,559 --> 01:01:34,189
Maybe we should order without him.

693
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:36,650
Does he abandon you often?

694
01:01:38,523 --> 01:01:39,983
Of course not.

695
01:01:41,151 --> 01:01:42,151
I was joking.

696
01:01:49,368 --> 01:01:52,328
I can come back another time,
if you think Einar would prefer it.

697
01:01:53,663 --> 01:01:54,833
Really.

698
01:01:54,915 --> 01:01:56,335
He's expecting you.

699
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
And it'll do him good.

700
01:02:03,715 --> 01:02:05,165
I know this.

701
01:02:06,510 --> 01:02:08,680
The fjord at Vejle,
not far from our houses.

702
01:02:09,221 --> 01:02:11,601
Yes, he painted it just before we left.

703
01:02:14,059 --> 01:02:15,059
Lili.

704
01:02:17,604 --> 01:02:18,694
Hans.

705
01:02:20,023 --> 01:02:21,903
May I introduce

706
01:02:22,067 --> 01:02:23,527
Lili Wegener.

707
01:02:24,361 --> 01:02:26,201
Einar's cousin from home.

708
01:02:29,533 --> 01:02:32,043
You cannot imagine how happy I am.

709
01:02:34,621 --> 01:02:40,001
We actually met once before, in Vejle,
but you probably don't remember.

710
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:45,590
May I take your coat?

711
01:02:45,674 --> 01:02:46,674
Of course.

712
01:02:49,177 --> 01:02:50,757
A digestif, Hans?

713
01:02:55,559 --> 01:02:57,559
It's so chilly all of a sudden.

714
01:02:58,854 --> 01:03:00,814
I feel the cold these days.
I don't know why.

715
01:03:01,064 --> 01:03:02,274
Here.

716
01:03:03,233 --> 01:03:04,443
HANS: Thank you.

717
01:03:08,822 --> 01:03:10,992
I'm so sorry that Einar couldn't be here.

718
01:03:11,783 --> 01:03:16,123
He told me how, back in Vejle,
you were his great friend.

719
01:03:17,289 --> 01:03:19,829
- Both always plotting to get away.
- That's true.

720
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,920
Such a tedious place! (CHUCKLES)

721
01:03:24,463 --> 01:03:28,763
He said that you would sit
and you'd look out together,

722
01:03:28,925 --> 01:03:31,085
beyond the fjord, to the sea.

723
01:03:32,262 --> 01:03:33,682
To the future.

724
01:03:34,097 --> 01:03:35,677
We had big dreams, yes.

725
01:03:37,017 --> 01:03:38,177
Yes.

726
01:03:40,103 --> 01:03:43,273
And that you were the only one
that would let him paint in peace.

727
01:03:44,149 --> 01:03:46,439
Who told him it was all
right to be a painter.

728
01:03:46,610 --> 01:03:48,190
He used to sketch my portrait.

729
01:03:49,112 --> 01:03:52,122
Take a stone and draw me on the rocks
at the side of the road.

730
01:03:52,324 --> 01:03:53,834
(CHUCKLES)

731
01:03:55,285 --> 01:03:56,535
I didn't know that.

732
01:03:56,703 --> 01:03:58,123
Yes.

733
01:04:01,124 --> 01:04:02,634
Would you like to see more of Einar's work?

734
01:04:02,793 --> 01:04:04,043
- Yes.
- But do we have any?

735
01:04:04,628 --> 01:04:05,958
Of course, Lili.

736
01:04:06,129 --> 01:04:07,839
Could we not do it another time?
Because I just...

737
01:04:08,006 --> 01:04:09,876
I want to hear more about you, Hans.

738
01:04:09,966 --> 01:04:10,966
Are you married?

739
01:04:11,134 --> 01:04:12,934
- Uh, no.
- Well, why not?

740
01:04:16,098 --> 01:04:17,808
You don't mind, do you?

741
01:04:17,849 --> 01:04:21,019
I've been on my own a long time now.
I'm too set in my ways.

742
01:04:23,897 --> 01:04:27,357
I think that marriage is the single thing
we should all hope for in life.

743
01:04:27,984 --> 01:04:28,994
Really?

744
01:04:30,153 --> 01:04:32,533
It creates someone else.

745
01:04:33,740 --> 01:04:35,910
More than just the two of you.

746
01:04:38,662 --> 01:04:40,752
Yes, I think it'd be terrible not to...

747
01:04:43,667 --> 01:04:47,247
I think it'd be terrible... I'm so...
Will you excuse me?

748
01:04:47,754 --> 01:04:48,764
Lili.

We'll talk more tomorrow.

Can I borrow a nightdress?

762
01:06:01,453 --> 01:06:03,163
No, we've never done that.

763
01:06:05,415 --> 01:06:07,495
Lili's never spent the night.

764
01:06:09,127 --> 01:06:11,127
It doesn't matter what I wear.

765

Yes.

But now that I'm back,
I can sit for you again.

01:11:27,028 --> 01:11:28,448
I need my husband.

838
01:11:29,948 --> 01:11:31,408
Go get him.

839
01:11:34,578 --> 01:11:36,078
I can't.

840
01:11:36,246 --> 01:11:40,036
I need to talk to my husband.
I need to hold my husband.

841
01:11:42,127 --> 01:11:43,497
I need him.

842
01:11:44,588 --> 01:11:46,588
Can't you just get him?

843
01:11:50,677 --> 01:11:52,467
Can you at least try?

844
01:11:57,684 --> 01:11:58,944
No. I'm sorry.

845
01:12:32,135 --> 01:12:33,135
Gerda.

846
01:12:35,013 --> 01:12:36,013
What is it?

847
01:12:48,193 --> 01:12:49,863
Are you all right?

848
01:13:09,673 --> 01:13:10,923
Oh, my God.

849
01:13:15,345 --> 01:13:16,345
Gerda, wait.

850
01:13:17,055 --> 01:13:18,255
Wait!

851
01:13:50,338 --> 01:13:52,628
I don't think I can

852
01:13:52,799 --> 01:13:54,379
give you what you want.

853
01:14:09,608 --> 01:14:12,318
I don't know how long
we can go on like this.

854
01:14:17,449 --> 01:14:18,659
No.

855
01:14:29,169 --> 01:14:31,089
He needs to see someone.

856
01:14:31,213 --> 01:14:32,763
You know what happened with Hexler.

857
01:14:33,090 --> 01:14:34,220
But he's so thin.

858
01:14:36,051 --> 01:14:37,551
Something's wrong with him.

859
01:14:39,054 --> 01:14:41,184
(CHUCKLES) Lili watches her figure.

860
01:14:42,432 --> 01:14:44,102
Look.

861
01:14:44,142 --> 01:14:48,102
There's a doctor.
He runs the Women's Clinic in Dresden.

862
01:14:48,188 --> 01:14:50,228
He's interested in men like Einar

863
01:14:51,525 --> 01:14:52,695
who are

864
01:14:53,235 --> 01:14:54,245
confused.

865
01:14:56,196 --> 01:14:57,906
Men who are different.

866
01:14:59,491 --> 01:15:01,081
He's often in Paris.

867
01:15:01,243 --> 01:15:02,663
Just talk to him.

868
01:15:10,836 --> 01:15:12,416
GERDA: You're awake.

869
01:15:12,921 --> 01:15:14,091
How do you feel?

870
01:15:16,675 --> 01:15:17,765
Come.

871
01:15:18,301 --> 01:15:19,841
Listen, I've got somewhere to go.

872
01:15:20,095 --> 01:15:21,105
Where?

873
01:15:24,641 --> 01:15:25,811
Sorry, I...

874
01:15:28,395 --> 01:15:30,485
I don't know
how to hold on to you any longer.

875
01:15:34,693 --> 01:15:35,943
I know.

876
01:15:37,821 --> 01:15:39,451
But I love you,

877
01:15:40,824 --> 01:15:42,834
and I'm going to find an answer.

- English?
- English.

880
01:16:35,545 --> 01:16:37,335
Do you speak English?

881
01:16:37,381 --> 01:16:39,631
Are you, um, a boy or a girl?

882
01:16:39,716 --> 01:16:41,256
- A woman?
- Do you have a...

I can't hold the buyers much longer,
I'm sorry.

892
01:17:43,321 --> 01:17:44,451
HANS: Einar?

893
01:17:46,491 --> 01:17:47,951
You're good at this.

894
01:17:49,119 --> 01:17:50,579
I boxed for a while.

895
01:17:52,497 --> 01:17:54,327
Shame you weren't with me earlier.
(CHUCKLES)

896
01:18:01,673 --> 01:18:03,633
I'm sorry I've not been to see you before.

897
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:04,970
That's all right.

898
01:18:06,261 --> 01:18:07,761
You're here now.

899
01:18:09,306 --> 01:18:11,466
I couldn't let Gerda see me like this.

900
01:18:12,642 --> 01:18:14,312
She's had enough to put up with.

901
01:18:14,644 --> 01:18:16,154
What's happened to you?

902
01:18:18,815 --> 01:18:20,145
I don't understand.

903
01:18:22,527 --> 01:18:23,697
Nor do I.

904
01:18:27,532 --> 01:18:29,622
But I don't think it's anything new.

905
01:18:31,495 --> 01:18:33,005
Even back in Vejle...

906
01:18:33,830 --> 01:18:35,330
- What?
- Ow. Sorry.

907
01:18:40,337 --> 01:18:41,497
What?

908
01:18:42,923 --> 01:18:44,423
I was different.

909
01:18:46,510 --> 01:18:49,180
It didn't take much to
be different in Vejle.

910
01:18:49,346 --> 01:18:51,386
Surely that's why we became friends.

911
01:18:54,726 --> 01:18:55,976
Every morning

912
01:18:57,062 --> 01:19:01,152
I promise myself
that I will spend the entire day as Einar.

913
01:19:02,859 --> 01:19:05,189
But there's so little of Einar left.

914
01:19:05,821 --> 01:19:07,991
You think these things
because you're exhausted.

915
01:19:12,035 --> 01:19:15,035
Sometimes I think about killing Einar.

916
01:19:16,623 --> 01:19:21,213
But it's only the thought
that I'd be killing Lili too that stops me.

917
01:19:22,587 --> 01:19:24,047
You need to see someone.

918
01:19:25,048 --> 01:19:27,048
- A doctor.
- No.

919
01:19:27,092 --> 01:19:28,512
- Yes.
- No doctors.

920
01:19:28,719 --> 01:19:30,299
I'll help you find someone.

921
01:19:31,722 --> 01:19:33,512
You have to try.

922
01:19:36,143 --> 01:19:38,983
DR. BUSON: A confused state of identity.

923
01:19:39,438 --> 01:19:43,068
I drill small holes,

924
01:19:43,734 --> 01:19:45,744
here and here.

925
01:19:46,695 --> 01:19:48,575
I have listened to you very carefully,

926
01:19:48,613 --> 01:19:51,413
and I'm afraid it's not good news.

927
01:19:51,491 --> 01:19:53,281
You're a homosexual.

928
01:19:55,412 --> 01:19:58,582
Well, I don't really know
what kind of help I need, but I...

929
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:03,460
I can't go on living
without knowing who I am.

930
01:20:03,545 --> 01:20:04,745
Please excuse me for a moment.

931
01:21:00,811 --> 01:21:02,651
Do you think I'm insane?

932
01:21:08,068 --> 01:21:09,488
Did a doctor say that?

933
01:21:09,945 --> 01:21:12,705
I'm sorry. I know we agreed no more, but...

934
01:21:15,367 --> 01:21:16,447
Look at me.

935
01:21:16,493 --> 01:21:18,493
You are not insane.

936
01:21:23,750 --> 01:21:25,000
Did I do this to you?

937
01:21:26,670 --> 01:21:27,840
What?

938
01:21:31,883 --> 01:21:34,933
Sometimes, I... I wonder...

939
01:21:35,512 --> 01:21:37,182
If it hadn't been for the paintings...

940
01:21:37,222 --> 01:21:38,892
No. Gerda, no.

941
01:21:40,851 --> 01:21:44,731
You helped bring Lili to life,
but she was always there.

942
01:21:46,189 --> 01:21:47,189
She was always waiting.

943
01:21:47,691 --> 01:21:49,441
Now she's making you ill.

944
01:21:51,570 --> 01:21:53,200
I don't know what to do.

945
01:21:57,534 --> 01:21:59,544
The doctors can't help me.

946
01:22:05,042 --> 01:22:06,882
Do you want to try one more?

947
01:22:17,429 --> 01:22:19,599
...Warnekros, Einar. My husband.

948
01:22:19,681 --> 01:22:21,311
- Hello.
- Good to see you.

949
01:22:22,559 --> 01:22:24,229
So, what do you think would explain

950
01:22:24,269 --> 01:22:26,559
what you've been experiencing,
Mr. Wegener?

951
01:22:27,064 --> 01:22:29,234
Professor Warnekros, the fact is

952
01:22:32,319 --> 01:22:34,149
I believe that I am a woman,

953
01:22:36,239 --> 01:22:37,409
inside.

954
01:22:39,409 --> 01:22:41,079
And I believe it too.

955
01:22:48,377 --> 01:22:50,747
You probably think that I'm insane.

956
01:22:51,922 --> 01:22:54,092
Or that we both are.

957
01:22:54,591 --> 01:22:56,091
Well,

958
01:22:56,176 --> 01:22:58,846
there are people who think that I'm insane.

959
01:23:03,225 --> 01:23:05,145
But I think you're probably right.

960
01:23:10,023 --> 01:23:12,943
I've met another man like you.

961
01:23:14,611 --> 01:23:16,111
I pursued his case,

962
01:23:16,947 --> 01:23:18,787
against the wishes of my colleagues,
of course.

963
01:23:20,283 --> 01:23:21,873
I told him I could operate

964
01:23:23,203 --> 01:23:24,753
to make him fully a woman.

965
01:23:26,748 --> 01:23:28,328
That was what he wanted.

966
01:23:28,417 --> 01:23:29,787
Is that really possible?

967
01:23:29,876 --> 01:23:31,336
GERDA: What happened to the man?

968
01:23:31,545 --> 01:23:33,005
Was the operation successful?

969
01:23:33,088 --> 01:23:35,628
On the morning of the first operation,
he ran away.

970
01:23:36,383 --> 01:23:37,433
He was too frightened.

971
01:23:37,467 --> 01:23:39,797
I wouldn't do that. I...

972
01:23:40,303 --> 01:23:42,143
WARNEKROS: Perhaps he was the smart one.

973
01:23:42,431 --> 01:23:44,681
The surgery has never
been attempted before.

974
01:23:44,808 --> 01:23:46,138
Never.

975
01:23:48,311 --> 01:23:51,401
Professor Warnekros, what is the surgery?

976
01:23:51,565 --> 01:23:52,985
Two operations.

977
01:23:53,734 --> 01:23:55,654
The first,
to remove the male parts entirely.

978
01:23:57,571 --> 01:23:59,291
The second,
once you're strong enough again,

979
01:24:00,574 --> 01:24:01,824
to construct a vagina.

980
01:24:10,083 --> 01:24:11,673
An irreversible change

981
01:24:14,004 --> 01:24:15,674
and a high risk of failure.

982
01:24:16,840 --> 01:24:18,090
Infections.

983
01:24:18,592 --> 01:24:19,632
Complications.

984
01:24:19,676 --> 01:24:21,176
It's too dangerous.

985
01:24:21,344 --> 01:24:23,354
It's my only hope.

986
01:24:26,183 --> 01:24:28,273
I leave for Dresden at lunchtime tomorrow.

987
01:24:32,147 --> 01:24:33,767
Mrs. Wegener,

988
01:24:35,358 --> 01:24:37,438
I do believe I can help your husband.

989
01:24:39,362 --> 01:24:42,242
But he won't be your husband
when I've finished.

990
01:24:49,998 --> 01:24:51,538
(TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS)

991
01:24:58,632 --> 01:25:00,342
I feel strange going dressed like this.

992
01:25:00,509 --> 01:25:01,719
It's important.

993
01:25:02,969 --> 01:25:04,799
Hans said
the Germans might check your papers.

994
01:25:05,055 --> 01:25:06,315
You're nearly there.

995
01:25:07,891 --> 01:25:09,391
I won't be seeing you again.

996
01:25:12,229 --> 01:25:14,899
I've only really liked
a handful of people in my life,

997
01:25:16,733 --> 01:25:17,853
and you've been two of them.

998
01:25:18,151 --> 01:25:19,241
(LAUGHS)

999
01:25:22,864 --> 01:25:24,124
Take care.

1000
01:25:28,328 --> 01:25:29,498
Take care.

1001
01:25:34,751 --> 01:25:36,841
I wish you'd let me come with you.

1002
01:25:38,088 --> 01:25:39,258
I can't.

1003
01:25:40,882 --> 01:25:42,592
You love Einar,

No, God made me a woman.

You know, sometimes I do wonder
why you let me go through all this,

if you thought that
everything would be the same afterwards.

I didn't.

But I promised Einar
that I would take care of you.

1147
01:38:53,842 --> 01:38:56,182
For goodness' sakes, Gerda, Einar is dead.

1148
01:38:56,219 --> 01:38:57,889
We both have to accept that.

1149
01:38:59,973 --> 01:39:02,563
You took care of me,
but now I have to take care of myself.

1150
01:39:02,601 --> 01:39:04,691
I have to have a life of my own.

01:40:29,354 --> 01:40:31,364
Because you can't talk to me.

1167
01:40:32,983 --> 01:40:34,823
I've made a decision.

1168
01:40:36,153 --> 01:40:38,203
I'm going back to Dresden
for the second operation.

1169
01:40:38,989 --> 01:40:40,199
That's too soon.

1170
01:40:40,282 --> 01:40:41,782
No... No, it's time.

1171
01:40:42,075 --> 01:40:44,155
I need to finish what I started.

1172
01:40:44,244 --> 01:40:45,254
You're not strong enough.

1173
01:40:45,328 --> 01:40:47,458
Professor Warnekros thinks that I am.

1174
01:40:48,331 --> 01:40:49,711
Warnekros?

1175
01:40:49,833 --> 01:40:51,333
Warnekros hasn't seen you.

1176
01:40:51,418 --> 01:40:52,628
I've made up my mind, Gerda.

1177
01:40:53,837 --> 01:40:55,167
It could kill you.

1178
01:40:55,213 --> 01:40:57,383
I'm going on Friday. Will you come with me?

1179
01:41:01,511 --> 01:41:03,851
I won't help you to hurt yourself.

1180
01:41:21,364 --> 01:41:22,874
Gerda, will you come?

1181
01:41:44,679 --> 01:41:47,059
This will be harder than
the first operation.

1182
01:41:48,475 --> 01:41:49,685
You understand that?

1183
01:41:50,894 --> 01:41:53,354
Yes, I do.

1184
01:41:55,857 --> 01:41:57,727
It's complex surgery.

1185
01:41:59,903 --> 01:42:02,863
And I will sleep all the way through it.

1186
01:42:03,907 --> 01:42:05,407
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

1187
01:42:06,201 --> 01:42:07,291
Yes, you will.

1188
01:42:07,411 --> 01:42:09,871
And you'll be there when I wake up.

1189
01:42:12,207 --> 01:42:13,577
Of course.

1190
01:42:14,584 --> 01:42:17,004
I want a husband who looks just like you.

1191
01:42:20,382 --> 01:42:21,382
Um...

1192
01:42:22,092 --> 01:42:24,092
Maybe a child one day.

1193
01:42:28,348 --> 01:42:30,098
Like a real woman.

1194
01:42:31,518 --> 01:42:33,348
One step at a time.

1195
01:42:40,902 --> 01:42:42,992
Get some rest. Good night.

1196
01:42:53,206 --> 01:42:54,576
(GRUNTS FAINTLY)

1197
01:42:55,667 --> 01:42:57,207
Are you still angry with me?

1198
01:42:58,628 --> 01:43:00,378
I'm not angry with you.

1199
01:43:02,340 --> 01:43:04,180
I'm worried about you.

1200
01:43:05,969 --> 01:43:08,009
You heard my wish, Gerda.

1201
01:43:09,598 --> 01:43:11,428
When no one else could hear me,

1202
01:43:12,726 --> 01:43:14,306
you did.

1203
01:43:19,232 --> 01:43:20,362
Come.

1204
01:43:21,193 --> 01:43:22,823
We both need our rest.

1205
01:43:23,653 --> 01:43:24,853
I'll sleep on the chair there.

1206
01:43:26,907 --> 01:43:29,527
- No, off to your little hotel.
- I don't mind.

1207
01:43:29,618 --> 01:43:31,158
Here, take this.

1208
01:43:31,203 --> 01:43:32,703
Because there's a chill in the air.

1209
01:43:35,499 --> 01:43:37,709
- No.
- Please.

1210
01:43:37,793 --> 01:43:40,093
You have it. For now.

1211
01:43:41,797 --> 01:43:43,507
I'm going to be fine.

1212
01:43:44,549 --> 01:43:45,679
Yes.

1213
01:43:54,351 --> 01:43:55,521

1214
01:43:57,229 --> 01:43:58,399

1215
01:43:59,189 --> 01:44:00,609

Thank you.

01:45:02,919 --> 01:45:04,249
Hans.

1225
01:45:15,223 --> 01:45:16,773
It's all right.

1226
01:45:16,975 --> 01:45:19,475
Everything will be all right.

1227

NURSE: Miss Elbe.

1228
01:45:41,291 --> 01:45:42,501
It's time.

1229
01:45:55,389 --> 01:45:57,389
WARNEKROS: Good luck, everybody.

1230
01:46:04,940 --> 01:46:06,440
Swab, quick.

1231
01:46:16,493 --> 01:46:19,003
Professor Warnekros would like a word.

1232
01:46:22,124 --> 01:46:24,004
She lost a lot of blood.

1233
01:46:24,084 --> 01:46:26,794
Now we are struggling
to keep the fever down.

1234
01:46:26,837 --> 01:46:29,337
There's a chance it might
burn itself out, but...

1235
01:46:33,719 --> 01:46:35,089
I have to be honest.

1236
01:46:36,680 --> 01:46:38,100
The prognosis is not...

1237
01:46:42,728 --> 01:46:45,148
GERDA: Come here. Just lie still.

1238
01:46:46,481 --> 01:46:48,521
It's all right. Shh.

How are you, Lili?

1244
01:48:02,307 --> 01:48:03,727
I am

1245
01:48:04,810 --> 01:48:07,850
entirely myself.

1246
01:48:11,233 --> 01:48:13,323
You had us worried there, you know?

1247
01:48:16,113 --> 01:48:19,283
Can we go outside, Gerda?

1248
01:48:22,327 --> 01:48:24,157
Into the garden?

1249
01:48:24,329 --> 01:48:25,959
You should rest.

1250
01:48:32,045 --> 01:48:33,335
Please.

1251
01:48:53,817 --> 01:48:56,947
You mustn't worry about me anymore, Gerda.

1252
01:48:59,281 --> 01:49:00,911
It's an old habit.

1253
01:49:02,409 --> 01:49:03,449
I'm slow to change.

I had the most beautiful dream.

I dreamed that I was a baby
in my mother's arms.

And she looked down at me,

and she called me Lili.
