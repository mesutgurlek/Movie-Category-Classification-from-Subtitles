1
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,908
You can operate here,

2
00:01:47,085 --> 00:01:50,171
but remember to pay dues to us.

3
00:01:50,338 --> 00:01:52,162
Show some respect.

4
00:01:52,339 --> 00:01:54,622
I'm not a "yakuza".

5
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,500
I'm not paying you anything.

6
00:01:58,969 --> 00:02:00,626
But you act like a yakuza.

7
00:02:03,347 --> 00:02:05,964
So, the police can arrest me.

8
00:02:06,141 --> 00:02:11,405
But I needn't put up with your bullshit.

9
00:02:11,978 --> 00:02:14,345
Then you're as good as dead!

10
00:02:17,024 --> 00:02:18,598
Don't be an idiot.

11
00:02:21,027 --> 00:02:23,101
You're the idiot.

12
00:02:48,005 --> 00:02:50,246
Waiting for your date?

13
00:02:52,925 --> 00:02:54,551
He's not coming.

14
00:02:59,597 --> 00:03:03,297
I'll finish work soon, we could go to a club.

15
00:03:28,284 --> 00:03:31,620
Boss, Kitajima called you a little while ago.

16
00:03:31,787 --> 00:03:34,278
He said he'd call you back.

17
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:39,699
How did it go?

18
00:03:42,753 --> 00:03:45,245
Let's sort him out.

19
00:03:47,924 --> 00:03:49,915
I'll get it.

20
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:00,047
It's the old man.

21
00:04:06,187 --> 00:04:07,730
Hello...

22
00:04:08,814 --> 00:04:09,929
...yes...

23
00:04:12,275 --> 00:04:14,401
Today?

24
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,894
Okay.

25
00:04:20,156 --> 00:04:22,564
How are you, sir?

26
00:04:23,074 --> 00:04:26,024
I thought you'd decided to go back home?

27
00:04:26,202 --> 00:04:29,735
The cafe needed a waiter so,

28
00:04:29,913 --> 00:04:32,196
I thought I'd stay a bit longer.

29
00:04:32,623 --> 00:04:35,792
Act like a waiter then.

30
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:38,919
Okay, sir.

31
00:04:39,086 --> 00:04:42,338
If you muck me about, you'll pay for it.

32
00:04:43,172 --> 00:04:45,216
Sorry, sir.

33
00:05:04,313 --> 00:05:06,054
Murakawa Productions.

34
00:05:08,191 --> 00:05:11,276
Kashimoto for you, sir.

35
00:05:13,861 --> 00:05:15,571
Katagiri speaking.

36
00:05:21,033 --> 00:05:24,567
- Tanaka can drive can't he?
- Yes.

37
00:05:25,287 --> 00:05:27,027
You know that mah-jong parlour?

38
00:05:27,205 --> 00:05:29,362
Yes.

39
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:35,627
- Go there and wait for me.
- Okay.

40
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:39,870
You can't?

41
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,342
Don't bullshit me!

42
00:05:44,509 --> 00:05:47,459
People like us don't lend money for nothing!

43
00:05:47,636 --> 00:05:49,596
Don't dare try it on with us!

44
00:06:10,028 --> 00:06:11,310
Ken...

45
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:15,240
...I'd like to quit the Yakuza.

46
00:06:15,448 --> 00:06:19,441
We've led the tough life for too long.

47
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:22,610
I'm worn out.

48
00:06:23,371 --> 00:06:27,499
Maybe you're too rich for this trade now...

49
00:06:56,311 --> 00:06:57,938
They're here.

50
00:06:58,563 --> 00:07:01,013
I hear they're doing well.

51
00:07:01,315 --> 00:07:05,860
His patch is booming, thanks to
the new underground line.

52
00:07:06,027 --> 00:07:09,144
Our business is lousy.

53
00:07:10,947 --> 00:07:13,522
This trip may change our fortunes.

54
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:16,952
So handle it carefully.

55
00:07:19,704 --> 00:07:21,945
The Nakamatsu clan of Okinawa,

56
00:07:22,247 --> 00:07:24,780
is at war with the Anan clan.

57
00:07:24,957 --> 00:07:29,117
They're begging us for help.

58
00:07:29,502 --> 00:07:33,161
So we must send some soldiers down there.

59
00:07:33,339 --> 00:07:37,331
Would you fly down there with some men?

60
00:07:38,592 --> 00:07:42,210
Three of my men were killed on our last sortie.

61
00:07:42,387 --> 00:07:43,669
I didn't like that.

62
00:07:44,263 --> 00:07:47,630
That's how you earned your patch.

63
00:07:48,683 --> 00:07:52,811
Isn't business booming?
Show the boss some appreciation.

64
00:07:53,103 --> 00:07:55,469
Only if you go with me, Takahashi.

65
00:07:56,814 --> 00:07:58,440
You know that I must...

66
00:07:58,607 --> 00:08:02,474
...take care of the boss and the syndicate.

67
00:08:02,652 --> 00:08:04,809
I can't go, even if I wanted to.

68
00:08:04,987 --> 00:08:06,311
Who'll look after my patch?

69
00:08:06,821 --> 00:08:09,855
Katagiri will be your lieutenant.

70
00:08:10,032 --> 00:08:12,242
Don't worry.

71
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:15,859
It's an operation to restore peace,
there shouldn't be any bloodshed.

72
00:09:12,953 --> 00:09:15,278
You may smoke.

73
00:09:23,544 --> 00:09:26,494
Nakamatsu may be my sworn brother,

74
00:09:26,671 --> 00:09:29,079
but he's never done anything for me.

75
00:09:29,257 --> 00:09:31,748
He's only a distant family relative.

76
00:09:31,925 --> 00:09:35,376
But you boys are my immediate family.

77
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:38,378
We've sworn allegiance,

78
00:09:38,597 --> 00:09:41,964
and put our lives in your hands, boss.

79
00:09:42,433 --> 00:09:44,591
You're putting my life in his hands.

80
00:09:58,611 --> 00:10:01,895
A call for you, Mr. Murakawa.

81
00:10:11,788 --> 00:10:14,790
- I'm going.
- Goodbye.

82
00:10:14,957 --> 00:10:17,281
You may join us now.

83
00:11:05,577 --> 00:11:06,494
Well...?

84
00:11:41,395 --> 00:11:42,594
What...?

85
00:12:13,252 --> 00:12:14,325
What's going on?

86
00:12:14,503 --> 00:12:16,410
Over there...

87
00:12:23,467 --> 00:12:25,959
Aren't we naughty ?

88
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:47,099
Mr. Murakawa, please, listen...

89
00:12:47,277 --> 00:12:49,153
Shut up, punk!

90
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,822
Let's be reasonable...
...how much do you want?

91
00:12:53,114 --> 00:12:54,396
Too late.

92
00:12:56,950 --> 00:13:00,609
How long can he stay under?

93
00:13:00,786 --> 00:13:03,403
Two or three minutes, I imagine.

94
00:13:04,372 --> 00:13:06,614
So let's try two minutes.

95
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:09,032
Go ahead!

96
00:13:11,127 --> 00:13:13,170
Mr. Murawaka...

97
00:13:13,462 --> 00:13:15,620
...please don't kill me !

98
00:13:21,885 --> 00:13:24,012
Please, don't!

99
00:14:11,922 --> 00:14:13,746
Check him.

100
00:14:14,173 --> 00:14:16,707
Hey, pull him up.

101
00:14:33,563 --> 00:14:34,939
Still breathing?

102
00:14:38,566 --> 00:14:41,183
Please, stop.

103
00:14:42,361 --> 00:14:44,644
Try three minutes.

104
00:14:44,821 --> 00:14:46,895
Go ahead.

105
00:14:47,239 --> 00:14:48,865
No, please...

106
00:15:02,917 --> 00:15:06,576
Mr. Murakawa, please!

107
00:15:20,097 --> 00:15:23,349
There's something fishy about the Okinawa trip.

108
00:15:25,142 --> 00:15:29,468
The old man says both sides are
waiting for us to restore peace.

109
00:15:29,645 --> 00:15:32,981
It's a sticky situation....

110
00:15:35,066 --> 00:15:39,017
We lost three men on the Hokkaido job.

111
00:15:57,666 --> 00:15:59,949
Isn't it over three minutes?

112
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,169
Oh, yes.

113
00:16:21,308 --> 00:16:22,768
Oh, we've killed him...

114
00:16:26,395 --> 00:16:29,345
...but never mind. Deal with it!

115
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:56,782
My name is Sakai, sir.

116
00:17:03,172 --> 00:17:05,215
Okumura.

117
00:17:09,218 --> 00:17:11,126
Hirose.

118
00:17:13,805 --> 00:17:15,431
ltoh.

119
00:17:16,348 --> 00:17:18,798
My men will join you guys.

120
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:22,686
You'd like to see me dead?

121
00:17:23,145 --> 00:17:26,064
Sure. I'd feel safer having a piss.

122
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:35,268
Introduce yourselves.

123
00:17:39,991 --> 00:17:41,982
Maeda, sir.

124
00:17:42,701 --> 00:17:44,077
Ohno.

125
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:46,996
Tsuda.

126
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:53,657
Why are you here?

127
00:17:56,127 --> 00:17:57,754
Mr. Takahashi says...

128
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:00,537
...you can take me to Okinawa.

129
00:18:01,006 --> 00:18:03,456
They look green!

130
00:18:04,675 --> 00:18:06,885
This isn't a school outing!

131
00:18:07,427 --> 00:18:08,418
What? Bastard!

132
00:18:47,749 --> 00:18:48,739
What you doing?

133
00:18:55,796 --> 00:18:58,465
I told you to give that up.

134
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:04,250
Welcolme to Okinawa.

135
00:19:04,427 --> 00:19:08,472
We'll take you to your office.

136
00:19:08,681 --> 00:19:12,298
Rest before the boss takes you out to dinner.

137
00:19:13,684 --> 00:19:14,351
Hi,

138
00:19:14,768 --> 00:19:16,259
I'm Ryoji.

139
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:20,637
If anyone wants a drink or an ice-cream, then...

140
00:19:21,231 --> 00:19:22,722
...Let's go, Shiraishi.

141
00:20:25,487 --> 00:20:27,196
Something to drink?

142
00:20:29,156 --> 00:20:33,315
My belly still hurts from when you stabbed me.

143
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:30,076
I don't believe my eyes.

144
00:21:33,286 --> 00:21:36,987
It's quite some time since we used this office.

145
00:21:37,164 --> 00:21:40,907
You won't be here long so,
I hope you don't mind the disorder.

146
00:21:41,584 --> 00:21:44,253
The toilet's over there...

147
00:21:45,712 --> 00:21:47,953
Ryoji, bring the tools.

148
00:21:50,174 --> 00:21:54,385
In case you might become lonely, take your pick.

149
00:21:56,845 --> 00:22:00,129
We took these off some Americans.

150
00:22:05,768 --> 00:22:07,843
What's that mean?

151
00:22:11,439 --> 00:22:13,847
Just a friendly welcolme!

152
00:22:14,024 --> 00:22:16,266
Or perhaps...

153
00:22:17,068 --> 00:22:18,695
...the end of the war.

154
00:22:27,034 --> 00:22:29,525
Well, what now?

155
00:22:30,328 --> 00:22:35,040
The boss talked to the Anan clan a little while ago.

156
00:22:35,665 --> 00:22:40,825
A few of them got worked up
about you guys coming...

157
00:22:45,673 --> 00:22:47,799
Taking a tea-break?

158
00:23:02,226 --> 00:23:05,885
I guess we must say hello to them?

159
00:23:13,902 --> 00:23:15,809
I'll try it now...

160
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:29,665
Nothing happened, idiot!

161
00:24:31,375 --> 00:24:35,242
It was an American grenade,
you can't rely on them.

162
00:24:36,837 --> 00:24:39,079
Now what?

163
00:24:50,389 --> 00:24:54,798
It all started when my one of my idiots
shot at an Anan man...

164
00:24:54,976 --> 00:24:58,843
Nothing serious...

165
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:01,303
...nobody was killed or anything...

166
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:05,348
...and I didn't need any help.

167
00:25:05,775 --> 00:25:09,028
But, your old man insisted on
sending some soldiers.

168
00:25:09,194 --> 00:25:14,146
And, I do appreciate you coming all this way.

169
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:22,569
We were told that you begged for some help.

170
00:25:23,747 --> 00:25:26,113
News to me...

171
00:25:26,874 --> 00:25:31,336
As I said, it was your man who insisted.

172
00:25:31,502 --> 00:25:33,827
Nothing serious here...

173
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:40,582
...just the sort of little problem
we encounter everyday.

174
00:26:43,263 --> 00:26:44,921
What are you doing tonight, sir?

175
00:26:47,766 --> 00:26:51,217
Mr. Uyeji is taking us out.

176
00:27:18,122 --> 00:27:20,280
Which part of Tokyo you from?

177
00:27:21,333 --> 00:27:22,740
Nakano.

178
00:27:25,669 --> 00:27:29,578
Then you know 'Tommy's, by the station?

179
00:27:31,507 --> 00:27:33,467
Never heard of it.

180
00:27:36,886 --> 00:27:40,586
- It's a popular place.
- Do you listen?

181
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,856
Smoke?

182
00:27:56,859 --> 00:27:58,766
What's that?

183
00:27:59,569 --> 00:28:01,445
Marijuana.

184
00:28:02,446 --> 00:28:06,824
No. I'm not into that.

185
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:18,531
- You all right?
- Fine.

186
00:28:19,625 --> 00:28:21,700
...Got any cigarettes?

187
00:28:45,436 --> 00:28:48,688
We'll reassemble and split into smaller units.

188
00:28:49,772 --> 00:28:53,681
Whoever wants to go home
can go back to Tokyo.

189
00:28:55,235 --> 00:28:57,935
This is war.

190
00:29:20,878 --> 00:29:22,953
Hello.

191
00:29:24,673 --> 00:29:27,790
- You can relax in a booth.
- No.

192
00:29:28,384 --> 00:29:31,417
- What would you like?
- Beer.

193
00:29:32,762 --> 00:29:35,764
I'll call some hostesses, shall I?

194
00:29:41,977 --> 00:29:45,146
It's Tomiko.

195
00:29:45,563 --> 00:29:49,347
Send some girls, we're getting busy.

196
00:29:52,443 --> 00:29:54,851
You know my friend Kinjo, of Nakano?

197
00:29:56,613 --> 00:30:00,772
He robbed a supermarket and
barricaded himself inside.

198
00:30:00,949 --> 00:30:02,909
I don't know him.

199
00:30:08,288 --> 00:30:11,124
What about Nanbara, a gang leader?

200
00:30:11,374 --> 00:30:14,626
Haven't you any decent friends?

201
00:30:14,793 --> 00:30:19,119
Someone famous, in baseball or something?

202
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:36,590
Another beer.

203
00:30:40,145 --> 00:30:42,553
- Hi, good evening.
- Good evening.

204
00:35:35,111 --> 00:35:36,653
All clear.

205
00:35:57,293 --> 00:36:00,494
It's my brothers house.

206
00:36:00,671 --> 00:36:04,205
He's in Osaka now. No one will bother us.

207
00:36:32,361 --> 00:36:35,895
I'll call Tokyo.

208
00:36:36,739 --> 00:36:38,699
About what?

209
00:36:38,866 --> 00:36:42,149
Just lie low and keep a check on things out here.

210
00:36:43,953 --> 00:36:47,236
- Nothing but beer and sake?
- No.

211
00:37:08,971 --> 00:37:12,056
You better aim straight. At the can.

212
00:37:13,766 --> 00:37:17,133
You almost hit me, idiot! I saw it fly past.

213
00:37:28,277 --> 00:37:30,268
Give it to me.

214
00:37:43,913 --> 00:37:44,830
Let's play.

215
00:37:46,123 --> 00:37:49,042
- What, sir?
- Stone, paper, scissors.

216
00:37:51,961 --> 00:37:53,535
You playing?

217
00:37:59,841 --> 00:38:01,749
You're first.

218
00:38:03,094 --> 00:38:05,220
What game?

219
00:38:06,138 --> 00:38:09,004
- You could've killed me!
- Let's continue.

220
00:38:09,557 --> 00:38:13,383
Stone, paper, scissors...

221
00:38:15,728 --> 00:38:18,678
- You again!
- Just hang on...

222
00:38:25,402 --> 00:38:28,185
- Again.
- It's the last chamber....

223
00:38:28,362 --> 00:38:33,074
Stone, paper, scissors...

224
00:38:35,326 --> 00:38:37,233
You lost that time.

225
00:38:41,872 --> 00:38:44,155
No! Don't!

226
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:54,340
I don't believe it...

227
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:10,633
...It was empty.

228
00:39:12,436 --> 00:39:14,313
Your boss is a weirdo.

229
00:39:15,563 --> 00:39:17,607
Watch your mouth!

230
00:39:17,773 --> 00:39:20,525
And you were shit scared.

231
00:39:49,046 --> 00:39:51,965
Don't just sit there, dance with me.

232
00:39:52,882 --> 00:39:55,332
No, some other time.

233
00:42:13,027 --> 00:42:14,653
You've watched it all?

234
00:42:17,488 --> 00:42:19,114
Are you a pervert?

235
00:42:20,490 --> 00:42:22,534
You enjoyed it?

236
00:42:23,785 --> 00:42:24,817
Answer me!

237
00:42:36,627 --> 00:42:42,715
You're a dead man. I'll slit your throat!

238
00:42:44,049 --> 00:42:46,374
...What are you doing?

239
00:43:06,357 --> 00:43:09,360
You sure the girl killed him?

240
00:43:13,071 --> 00:43:15,823
Two shots in the stomach.

241
00:43:19,534 --> 00:43:21,983
Shall we dump him?

242
00:43:27,164 --> 00:43:29,155
What about the car?

243
00:43:29,332 --> 00:43:31,376
We'll use it.

244
00:44:21,683 --> 00:44:24,185
Drive slowly...asshole.

245
00:44:38,758 --> 00:44:40,551
It's my friend.

246
00:45:09,823 --> 00:45:11,814
How's the boss?

247
00:45:11,991 --> 00:45:15,243
Still talking about the truce.

248
00:45:16,244 --> 00:45:18,652
I just can't work him out.

249
00:45:18,829 --> 00:45:22,822
Well, some clothes for you. Nothing fancy.

250
00:45:23,082 --> 00:45:24,281
Thanks.

251
00:45:24,458 --> 00:45:27,127
Call whenever you need me.

252
00:45:29,587 --> 00:45:31,245
Just a minute!

253
00:45:36,842 --> 00:45:39,334
Give these to Marimo at
'Bar Chez-Nous', will you ?

254
00:45:39,511 --> 00:45:41,585
What is it?

255
00:45:42,305 --> 00:45:43,962
A present.

256
00:45:44,306 --> 00:45:48,851
- I'm not your errand boy.
- Please, do me a favour.

257
00:46:13,327 --> 00:46:16,444
There's plenty more over here...

258
00:46:42,974 --> 00:46:44,381
I won.

259
00:46:46,185 --> 00:46:48,176
Let's fight with this.

260
00:46:48,436 --> 00:46:51,220
- What's that?
- Mai-no-umi.

261
00:47:15,415 --> 00:47:18,198
So, you like flashy shirts then?

262
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:22,034
- Doesn't it suit me?
- You look ridiculous!

263
00:50:01,286 --> 00:50:04,121
Can I visit you again sometime?

264
00:50:04,538 --> 00:50:07,655
Wouldn't bother.

265
00:50:43,317 --> 00:50:45,933
Why must I drive you home?

266
00:50:46,486 --> 00:50:48,810
I'm an awful driver.

267
00:50:49,404 --> 00:50:52,521
- Does it matter?
- Yes.

268
00:50:52,699 --> 00:50:55,232
This is my husbands car.

269
00:50:56,326 --> 00:50:58,369
Do I have to know!?

270
00:50:59,787 --> 00:51:02,987
When was the first time you killed anyone?

271
00:51:03,623 --> 00:51:05,531
When I was at high school.

272
00:51:06,125 --> 00:51:07,918
Who did you kill?

273
00:51:08,252 --> 00:51:09,628
My Dad.

274
00:51:10,295 --> 00:51:11,921
Why?

275
00:51:12,421 --> 00:51:15,121
He wouldn't let me screw girls!

276
00:51:45,445 --> 00:51:47,155
Get in the front.

277
00:52:30,854 --> 00:52:33,345
How could you run off such a wide road?

278
00:52:33,522 --> 00:52:35,263
A snake was crossing.

279
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:37,598
You've no driving license, have you?

280
00:52:39,026 --> 00:52:42,279
- She was driving.
- I wasn't.

281
00:52:43,947 --> 00:52:45,406
Push.

282
00:52:49,159 --> 00:52:52,161
Sure you'll make it back in one piece?

283
00:52:52,328 --> 00:52:54,121
Go.

284
00:52:59,791 --> 00:53:03,044
You must pay for the petrol.

285
00:53:27,187 --> 00:53:29,396
Watch out for holes.

286
00:53:38,195 --> 00:53:40,154
They're coming...

287
00:54:04,422 --> 00:54:06,747
Over here, quick!

288
00:54:07,299 --> 00:54:11,625
- Can we get across?
- Yes! Hurry up!

289
00:54:32,526 --> 00:54:34,767
Let's have a drink.

290
00:54:52,582 --> 00:54:55,157
Boss, isn't all this rather childish?

291
00:54:55,334 --> 00:54:57,826
What else can I do?

292
00:54:58,337 --> 00:55:01,704
Still wearing that shirt? It's terrible!

293
00:55:08,886 --> 00:55:11,721
- There's no more traps.
- You sure?

294
00:55:36,281 --> 00:55:38,324
Water!

295
00:55:44,829 --> 00:55:47,664
No more now,

296
00:55:48,081 --> 00:55:50,448
or else we can't have a bath.

297
00:55:52,585 --> 00:55:55,076
You can wait 'till it rains.

298
00:56:11,140 --> 00:56:13,464
Where's boss?

299
00:56:14,184 --> 00:56:16,800
Gone fishing, with that girl.

300
00:56:16,977 --> 00:56:19,219
She's here again?

301
00:56:20,271 --> 00:56:22,346
Guess she's in love...

302
00:56:27,318 --> 00:56:29,893
Don't you like the shirt anymore?

303
00:56:30,737 --> 00:56:31,728
None of your business, idiot!

304
00:56:37,993 --> 00:56:41,652
It's great to be not afraid of shooting people.

305
00:56:42,538 --> 00:56:44,414
That must mean...

306
00:56:44,581 --> 00:56:47,250
...you're not afraid of killing yourself, right?

307
00:56:48,667 --> 00:56:52,576
You're tough. I love tough men.

308
00:56:53,629 --> 00:56:55,912
If I were tough, would I carry a gun?

309
00:56:56,089 --> 00:56:57,799
But you shoot with ease...

310
00:56:57,966 --> 00:56:59,790
Because I scare with ease.

311
00:57:00,468 --> 00:57:03,001
But, you're not afraid of dying...

312
00:57:03,970 --> 00:57:06,128
If you're afraid of death for too long,

313
00:57:06,305 --> 00:57:08,213
it become's a death wish.

314
00:57:08,390 --> 00:57:10,631
I don't get it...

315
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:19,304
What's your plan from now?

316
00:57:20,857 --> 00:57:26,278
There's no word from Tokyo.
We better go home in a couple of days.

317
00:57:33,325 --> 00:57:35,483
"Screw me, darling".

318
00:57:36,994 --> 00:57:38,787
Screw yourself!

319
00:57:41,456 --> 00:57:46,991
"You're pestering my girl".
"Want a fight"?

320
00:57:51,547 --> 00:57:53,830
Will you just piss off!?

321
00:57:59,719 --> 00:58:00,793
''Smack''!

322
00:58:06,683 --> 00:58:08,340
...It's raining!

323
00:58:10,018 --> 00:58:12,510
Quick! Grab the shampoo...

324
00:59:09,770 --> 00:59:13,106
...It's great not to be afraid of showing your tits!

325
00:59:39,542 --> 00:59:42,294
Is that it? What the hell!

326
00:59:52,802 --> 00:59:55,127
Ready? Action!

327
01:00:02,684 --> 01:00:05,051
Enter slowly...

328
01:00:06,145 --> 01:00:08,678
Start again.

329
01:00:08,855 --> 01:00:12,358
Ready...Action!

330
01:00:42,255 --> 01:00:44,048
Call that dancing?

331
01:00:45,382 --> 01:00:48,218
You must enjoy yourself.

332
01:00:50,052 --> 01:00:52,293
I'll dance with you.

333
01:01:30,999 --> 01:01:32,708
Is Takahashi there?

334
01:01:32,875 --> 01:01:37,785
He's always "out".
He better be in next time.

335
01:01:46,427 --> 01:01:48,876
What about the change?

336
01:01:49,679 --> 01:01:51,920
Did you put money in?

337
01:01:53,265 --> 01:01:56,215
What do you take me for !
Of course I put money in.

338
01:01:56,517 --> 01:02:01,761
Is it a telephone or piggy-bank?
I can kill you for this!

339
01:03:40,343 --> 01:03:42,710
Not fair, you're using a gun!

340
01:03:56,272 --> 01:03:57,929
This isn't playing!

341
01:03:59,107 --> 01:04:00,483
Not fair!

342
01:04:02,693 --> 01:04:06,310
Mr. Murakawa, stop!

343
01:04:33,549 --> 01:04:36,999
- Where's Murakawa ?
- Maybe out on a date.

344
01:04:37,177 --> 01:04:41,471
- My boss wants to see him.
- What about?

345
01:04:41,847 --> 01:04:44,057
Proposing a truce.

346
01:04:44,432 --> 01:04:46,559
I'd better come along.

347
01:05:22,001 --> 01:05:28,037
Your boss's aide, Takahashi,
came to see me yesterday.

348
01:05:29,215 --> 01:05:32,874
He's been concluding
the truce with the Anan clan.

349
01:05:33,259 --> 01:05:35,626
That's good news.

350
01:05:37,054 --> 01:05:42,172
They accept on one condition.
Anan wants us to disband.

351
01:05:45,352 --> 01:05:47,760
What's your response?

352
01:05:48,354 --> 01:05:53,149
I can't do that. I'll fight to the end.

353
01:05:57,235 --> 01:05:59,278
Uyeji...

354
01:06:02,030 --> 01:06:04,647
...I will retire.

355
01:06:05,575 --> 01:06:08,149
She's expecting a baby, and I'm getting old.

356
01:06:09,536 --> 01:06:14,248
You take over my patch and the affairs.

357
01:06:15,707 --> 01:06:20,700
Choose whether to fight or disband.
Do as you must.

358
01:06:23,379 --> 01:06:26,079
Did Takahashi say anything about us?

359
01:06:27,007 --> 01:06:29,165
For the time being...

360
01:06:30,801 --> 01:06:32,845
...the Murakawa clan will be expelled.

361
01:06:37,390 --> 01:06:38,880
Goodbye, sir...

362
01:08:48,402 --> 01:08:50,529
Ha! Missed!

363
01:08:51,946 --> 01:08:55,480
Impossible! How can I hit it?

364
01:08:55,657 --> 01:08:58,826
It's not some Western. Here, try it.

365
01:09:05,498 --> 01:09:08,667
When I say, okay?

366
01:09:08,959 --> 01:09:11,711
Throw it that way...

367
01:09:11,878 --> 01:09:15,213
Okay? Throw!

368
01:09:17,340 --> 01:09:21,041
- Shit, it's empty!
- See, you can't hit it either!

369
01:11:20,388 --> 01:11:23,557
We'll put the heat on Takahashi.

370
01:11:24,475 --> 01:11:27,644
The boss wants to go all the way.

371
01:12:39,488 --> 01:12:42,104
Here.

372
01:12:56,125 --> 01:12:57,699
Yes?

373
01:13:01,212 --> 01:13:03,287
Mr. Takahashi here?

374
01:13:03,464 --> 01:13:05,705
I'am Takahashi.

375
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:09,468
Must be a mistake.

376
01:13:22,811 --> 01:13:25,678
He wouldn't register under his own name.

377
01:14:36,907 --> 01:14:37,606
Takahashi!

378
01:15:50,294 --> 01:15:52,170
I swear I know nothing.

379
01:16:04,930 --> 01:16:09,339
The boss always wanted Anan
to become his partner.

380
01:16:13,269 --> 01:16:18,262
But before that, he had to
get rid of Nakamatsu.

381
01:16:20,399 --> 01:16:24,225
The squabble was the ideal excuse...

382
01:16:25,268 --> 01:16:27,352
...to eliminate Nakamatsu.

383
01:16:32,116 --> 01:16:34,326
So, why expel me ?

384
01:16:34,493 --> 01:16:36,818
Your patch is booming,

385
01:16:38,037 --> 01:16:39,528
he's greedy and wanted a part.

386
01:16:45,126 --> 01:16:48,326
Listen, Murakawa.

387
01:16:49,629 --> 01:16:52,548
The boss is coming to see Anan.

388
01:16:54,132 --> 01:16:58,292
You can take over Nakamatsu's patch...

389
01:16:59,678 --> 01:17:01,919
...I can arrange it.

390
01:17:21,569 --> 01:17:23,477
Your turn.

391
01:17:25,656 --> 01:17:27,198
Not that.

392
01:18:12,523 --> 01:18:15,525
Now we must walk back.

393
01:18:16,151 --> 01:18:17,725
Sorry.

394
01:19:34,375 --> 01:19:36,251
Who are you?

395
01:19:40,004 --> 01:19:42,047
I'm lost.

396
01:20:50,222 --> 01:20:52,672
Are you coming back?

397
01:20:54,392 --> 01:20:56,049
Maybe.

398
01:20:57,519 --> 01:20:59,510
Will you wait for me?

399
01:20:59,687 --> 01:21:02,053
Maybe.

400
01:21:03,273 --> 01:21:05,556
Can I shoot it?

401
01:21:05,817 --> 01:21:07,443
Okay.

402
01:22:08,988 --> 01:22:11,312
Shall I go with you?

403
01:22:11,490 --> 01:22:13,773
Stupid question.

404
01:22:17,869 --> 01:22:20,986
You've had enough, haven't you?

405
01:24:45,185 --> 01:24:46,978
...Shit.

406
01:24:47,979 --> 01:24:51,346
The lights will go out in ten minutes.

407
01:25:16,500 --> 01:25:19,669
Fill her up on the way back.
