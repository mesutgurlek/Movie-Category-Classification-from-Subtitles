00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:06,750
PeoPle will be living there and working.

603
00:37:06,824 --> 00:37:09,156
Maybe even us.

604
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:31,238
The moon. It looks different now.

605
00:37:31,315 --> 00:37:34,716
It's not as mysterious or romantic.

606
00:37:34,785 --> 00:37:37,754
I'm sorry I ruined it for you.

607
00:37:39,056 --> 00:37:43,925
You didn't ruin it.
You just changed it, I guess.

we need to discuss.

[Sighs]

611
00:37:56,641 --> 00:37:59,940
I was wondering
when you'd bring this uP.

612
00:38:00,011 --> 00:38:05,142
I'm new at all this. I'm gonna
have to rely on your exPerience.

613
00:38:05,216 --> 00:38:07,650
Well, let's just do it naturally.

614
00:38:07,718 --> 00:38:10,619
You know? With no Planning.

615
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:13,714
How do we do it?
Our official breaking-uP tomorrow?

616
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:16,487
Right.

617
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:20,656
Right. That's exactly what
I was thinking about. The breakuP.

618
00:38:20,731 --> 00:38:23,222
Us ending our fake relationshiP.

619

I mean, I don't even know
whoever believed it.

620
00:38:27,104 --> 00:38:29,834
Us going out?
You, me? Yeah, right.

621
00:38:29,907 --> 00:38:34,003
Yeah, it does seem
kind of unrealistic.

622
00:38:34,078 --> 00:38:38,606
[Sighs]
Okay, so, how shall we do it?

623
00:38:38,683 --> 00:38:40,878
Stage a big fight?
A lovers' quarrel?

624
00:38:40,951 --> 00:38:44,648
No, we don't have anything
to fight about.

625
00:38:44,722 --> 00:38:48,556
Oh, that's okay. We can
make something uP. Let's see.
What do PeoPle fight about?

626
00:38:48,626 --> 00:38:53,290
Well, we wouldn't want
to damage your rePutation.

627
00:38:53,364 --> 00:38:56,492
- RePutation?
- I think a small, dignified ceremony...

628
00:38:56,567 --> 00:39:00,936
- is probably the best way...
- Me?

629
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:04,133
- to end it.
- With a rePutation.
Whoo! Yeah!

630
00:39:04,208 --> 00:39:06,142
I can't believe this.
A rePutation.

641
00:39:44,815 --> 00:39:49,013
and I think that now is the time
that we had our little talk.

- About what?
- Us. You know, me.

Well, um, I did
a little thinking too!

No, actually!
I did quite a bit of thinking!

647
00:40:07,338 --> 00:40:09,602
- And I decided that
you're breaking me.
- What?

Would you show some maturity?

I Probably wouldn't
have called you either.

I know. I mean, I don't know what
she ever saw in him.

01:25:22,086 --> 01:25:27,023
You better get back to your own
side, or I'm gonna send you back
to Geeksville in a milk carton!

1349
01:25:27,091 --> 01:25:30,356
Would you guys do something?

1350
01:25:35,266 --> 01:25:38,667
- Oh, return of the living dread.
- Why don't you lay off?

1351
01:25:38,736 --> 01:25:41,500
- Why don't you go back
where you belong, hosehead?
- Take your hands off Kenneth.

1352
01:25:41,572 --> 01:25:43,506
Or I'll break your arm.
Your Pitching arm!

1353
01:25:43,574 --> 01:25:46,236
Oh yeah? Well, don't make me
laugh, lawn boy.

1354
01:25:46,310 --> 01:25:48,904
Let go.

1355
01:25:50,248 --> 01:25:53,081
Now!

1356
01:25:57,622 --> 01:25:59,681
You broke your arm
once before, remember?

1357
01:25:59,757 --> 01:26:03,591
You fell out of our tree house.
Kenneth Picked you uP...

1358
01:26:03,661 --> 01:26:08,928
and we carried you 12 blocks
to the hosPital.
Yeah, you cried all the way.

1359
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:12,561
We were all friends then, remember?

1360
01:26:12,637 --> 01:26:15,231
And now you want to end his life...

1361
01:26:15,306 --> 01:26:19,037
because he's talking to Patty
on your side of the cafeteria.

1362
01:26:19,110 --> 01:26:23,740
Oh, man, that's stupid. I know, 'cause
that's where I wanted to be.

1363
01:26:23,814 --> 01:26:28,183
On your side, with your crowd.
But I messed uP.

1364
01:26:28,252 --> 01:26:31,153
See, I tried to buy my way in.

1365
01:26:31,222 --> 01:26:35,022
But Kenneth...
he's not trying to buy anybody.

1366
01:26:36,294 --> 01:26:40,731
He's just trying
to make friends. Being himself.

1367
01:26:40,798 --> 01:26:44,461
Cools, nerds,
your side, my side.

1368
01:26:44,535 --> 01:26:49,097
Man, it's all bullshit.
It's just tough enough to be yourself.

1369
01:26:59,150 --> 01:27:01,448
It's all right.

1370
01:27:15,533 --> 01:27:17,694
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

1371
01:27:34,218 --> 01:27:36,584
[Cheers, APPlause]

1372

[Engine Off]

1373
01:28:17,528 --> 01:28:20,190
This should cover it.

1374
01:28:31,776 --> 01:28:33,767
I saw a crack in the moon last night.

1375
01:28:33,844 --> 01:28:36,176
Yeah, me too.

1376

You ready?

1378

Come on. Let's go.

1379
01:28:42,453 --> 01:28:44,444
- I gotta go, okay?
- Yeah.

1380
01:28:44,522 --> 01:28:46,456
- See ya.
- Bye-bye.

1381
01:28:48,192 --> 01:28:51,286
[Chattering]

1382
01:29:06,777 --> 01:29:08,802
Hi, Ronnie.

1383
01:29:15,519 --> 01:29:19,421
- All right! Take a chance!
- Whoo-hoo!

1384

01:30:00,564 --> 01:30:03,055
Okay, let's get this deal
straight one last time.

1391
01:30:03,134 --> 01:30:05,932
Now, you can have
Saturday nights, but only
if you ask me in advance.

1392
01:30:06,003 --> 01:30:08,665
Okay, I'm asking you
in advance: Will you go
to the Prom with me?

1393
01:30:08,739 --> 01:30:12,106
Not if you do
that stuPid dance.

1394
01:30:12,176 --> 01:30:14,406
- Okay, how about kissing?
- Yeah, it's imPortant.

1395
01:30:14,478 --> 01:30:17,641
- Oh, it's a must.
- Definitely. [Laughs]
