1
00:02:24,964 --> 00:02:28,250
I've been thinking about what 
were you said that concrete goal.

2
00:02:33,644 --> 00:02:36,805
- And?
- I think, I've known it.

3
00:02:36,905 --> 00:02:39,279
I'm feeling really good about this one, Al.

4
00:02:40,763 --> 00:02:42,469
Lay down it?

5
00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:45,413
- It's a girl.
- Cool! What's she like?

6
00:02:45,513 --> 00:02:50,927
You know, smart, beautiful, popular...
A classic TGFY.

7
00:02:51,558 --> 00:02:56,635
- Too Good For You, Al.
- But not for you?

8
00:02:56,735 --> 00:03:01,691
Well, I'm sorta outside the whole highschool
foodchain at this point, wouldn't you say?

9
00:03:06,855 --> 00:03:09,878
- See you gonna ask her out?
- Ask her out?

10
00:03:10,258 --> 00:03:12,460
No. Bad idea, no.

11
00:03:12,461 --> 00:03:16,073
I mean... where's the therapeutic value in that?

12
00:03:16,174 --> 00:03:19,390
- So what's the plan?
- Simple.

13
00:03:19,596 --> 00:03:21,869
I'm gonna have fun with her.

14
00:03:21,995 --> 00:03:26,533
- Fun? What's that mean?
- Fun?

15
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:32,192
Fun means fun. Right? 
Don't over think it, Al.

16
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,654
It's been nice known you.

17
00:03:35,689 --> 00:03:40,380
- Next week?
- You know way, Al? You've made so much progress here,

18
00:03:40,415 --> 00:03:42,239
- I think you're ready to face the world on your own way now.
- Keith?!

19
00:03:42,274 --> 00:03:45,141
Don't worry, Al. You can cope.

20
00:04:03,282 --> 00:04:04,978
- Keep it in mind!
- Hi, Anderson! How are you?

21
00:04:05,076 --> 00:04:08,497
- Thanks so much. And how are you?
- I'm good, I'm just chilling.

22
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:43,558

23
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:46,889
- You're Rafael, are you?
- Yeah. And you're...?

24
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:50,402
- Natalie... Anderson.
- Oh, a head of... everything.

25
00:04:50,403 --> 00:04:53,638
- I try to keep easy this.
- Only work, no play?

26
00:04:53,709 --> 00:04:55,744
None. Zero.

27
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:59,765
- Do you working now?
- Oh, absolutely. It's a Key Club...

28
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:03,467
We're checking on the stranger students
making sure their adjusting okay.

29
00:05:03,502 --> 00:05:05,841
- Oh, well what a thought.
- I can tell.

30
00:05:05,876 --> 00:05:09,566
- You've nearly about 50-60 new friends.
- Hey, brother.

31
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:13,272
- 61.
- Yeah. It's nice to know somebody cares.

32
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:24,468
- Rain...
- Yeah.

33
00:05:25,043 --> 00:05:27,654
- Rain...
- Natalie, come on!

34
00:05:27,655 --> 00:05:31,586
Alright, so I'm gonna go.
It's nice to meet you. We'll talk to later.

35
00:05:31,621 --> 00:05:35,512
- Comme on, let's go!

36
00:05:54,693 --> 00:05:59,055
Zach! Breakfast is on the table!

37
00:06:00,069 --> 00:06:04,139
- Natalie! Please get him up!
- Okay, okay!

38
00:06:10,796 --> 00:06:13,617
Zach! Wake up!

39
00:06:15,344 --> 00:06:17,772
Didn't come home.

40
00:06:18,335 --> 00:06:22,039
- Morning!
- Morning!

41
00:06:26,991 --> 00:06:30,543
Natie... Miles is a leftist,
you can have to work with the backhand!

42
00:06:30,781 --> 00:06:33,752
We know, we must been the whole 
practice fill in backhand today.

43
00:06:33,753 --> 00:06:36,008
- According to my records last year...
- I'm over, Dead.

44
00:06:36,009 --> 00:06:39,588
- ...she's catched with her service. 11 aces.
- ...aces. Thanks for reminding me.

45
00:06:39,589 --> 00:06:43,103
- Natie is quicker now.
- If you'll being a recording job at least you'll rise 3 places.

46
00:06:43,138 --> 00:06:46,742
- What's this "if" about?
- Bye.

47
00:06:47,572 --> 00:06:50,277
- Natie, sit down have some breakfast!
- I've got Key Club this morning, Mom.

48
00:06:50,278 --> 00:06:52,330
You need have some protein. Sit down, please!

49
00:06:52,331 --> 00:06:53,885
I have a barn.

50
00:06:53,934 --> 00:06:56,837
- A barn is not a breakfast.
- Bye!

51
00:06:57,684 --> 00:07:00,266
In as for the straight subconstruction experinments...

52
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,543
The couples are:
Hobbs and Mertin, Carlens and Stevens,

53
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,293
Brent and Aldridge, Anderson and
Zetterstrom, Brandon and Davins...

54
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:33,300
- Zetterstrom?
- Haven't lied to you this far. I'm not gonna start now.

55
00:07:39,147 --> 00:07:41,577
You wanna help?

56
00:07:50,537 --> 00:07:54,934
- We don't need that for this.
- Look, you're not gonna be disagreable, are you?

57
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:58,668
Because Walt specifically promised 
me an agreeable lab partner.

58
00:07:58,703 --> 00:08:01,200
- Walt?
- You need to relax.

59
00:08:01,222 --> 00:08:03,729
- Actually I need to learn this.
- Because why?

60
00:08:04,002 --> 00:08:07,880
Because you need to a four on your AP exam
if you want to get a college credit location, didn't you know.

61
00:08:07,881 --> 00:08:09,390
Then you'll be ahead of the game, right?

62
00:08:09,595 --> 00:08:12,962
Then I can focus on that things 
where good I and keep up my GPA.

63
00:08:13,202 --> 00:08:16,600
Okay, so we need to fill this one with
natrium-tiosulphate and this one with nitrate...

64
00:08:16,602 --> 00:08:18,397
Gotta keep up that GPA.

65
00:08:18,809 --> 00:08:21,630
- It's kinda help if you wanna to get a job.
- A job?

66
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:25,345
- Can we just do the lab?
- I'd love to! Let's do the lab!

67
00:08:25,795 --> 00:08:31,900
Except you're about ten years into the future...

68
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:36,790
We don't need chemistry.
We need time travel.

69
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,200
Mr. Miles, this is AP.

70
00:08:39,892 --> 00:08:43,537
Keith is actually pretty sharp
when he press myself.

71
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,043
Okay.

72
00:08:45,644 --> 00:08:48,352
- But a bit kind of...
- Left chemistry?

73
00:08:50,561 --> 00:08:54,686
- Yeah.
- Try to make it work, okay?

74
00:09:00,676 --> 00:09:01,972
- About this Natalie Anderson...
- Yes?

75
00:09:02,505 --> 00:09:07,599
Walter, she's a complete, anal compulsive control freak! 
How the hell do you expect in a work with that?

76
00:09:08,287 --> 00:09:10,898
- But Keith, you were who...
- I'm kidding. Kidding.

77
00:09:11,938 --> 00:09:13,320
I would pretty shake.

78
00:09:17,008 --> 00:09:18,580
Who the hell do you think you are?

79
00:09:20,145 --> 00:09:22,500
What do you think I am?

80
00:09:40,097 --> 00:09:43,380
- Hey, Miss Key Club!
- Hey!

81
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:48,559
- So how are your adjusting?
- Oh, wow, you'll told me how am I done?

82
00:09:48,964 --> 00:09:53,020
Well, you've got only one a 98 percent history
mainthemes so your beginmatch fall at all.

83
00:09:54,015 --> 00:09:59,520
- I hate people like you.
- Hey, so listen, are you gonna be at the brink on friday?

84
00:09:59,611 --> 00:10:02,507
- Are you going?
- It could happen.

85
00:10:14,301 --> 00:10:15,836
Who's that guy?

86
00:10:16,613 --> 00:10:20,254
Oh... he's just my lab parner. Nobody.

87
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,586
- See you don't remember?
- What?

88
00:10:28,621 --> 00:10:31,257
Well, I've sit behind you on the sixth great play

89
00:10:31,258 --> 00:10:34,300
when you were the princess and 
I was russian soldier number three.

90
00:10:35,181 --> 00:10:37,649
- I don't remember that.
- Of course not.

91
00:10:37,684 --> 00:10:40,000
Princess never remembers lower people.

92
00:10:40,993 --> 00:10:43,451
- Excuse me, well I'll cry for you.
- You should!

93
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:47,100
Should cry for me because 
you're already on the early-decision tour.

94
00:10:49,711 --> 00:10:52,783
It's posted in the front office.

95
00:10:52,784 --> 00:10:55,409
- Why are they do that?
- Why Duke?

96
00:10:57,186 --> 00:11:01,208
- Great faculty, division no.1, of the kind...
- I'm sure, you'll get what you pay for.

97
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:05,212
- Actually I have a partial scholarship.
- Ah, that's right.

98
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:08,168
- There it goes the positive...
- Tennis.

99
00:11:09,605 --> 00:11:13,698
So they basically give you a punch of money
for banding a ball over a net.

100
00:11:14,201 --> 00:11:16,533
Something like that.
Where did you apply?

101
00:11:17,293 --> 00:11:18,868
Nowhere.

102
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:24,900
- Your're not gonna be to college?
- Not in Judeo Christian sense. No, I am not.

103
00:11:25,431 --> 00:11:27,703
So, what are you doing after graduation?

104
00:11:28,543 --> 00:11:31,988
- The sky's the limit.
- It's simple made it.

105
00:11:34,533 --> 00:11:37,169
- Why are you taking in AP class...?
- I'm in packed.

106
00:11:37,269 --> 00:11:38,760
Then you were placed here for what?

107
00:11:43,017 --> 00:11:45,276
- I'm sure there's a very simple explanation.
- Of course there is Natalie,

108
00:11:45,277 --> 00:11:47,560
and you're not can stop to you'll figured it out.

109
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,207
That's on like a challenge. You're on.

110
00:11:53,014 --> 00:11:55,496
So this's all based some a little conversation.

111
00:11:55,686 --> 00:11:59,181
- You know, he don't gonna be ovbious can be there tonight.
- Oh, he'll definitely be there.

112
00:11:59,457 --> 00:12:01,966
Oh, your power positive thinking?

113
00:12:03,854 --> 00:12:05,400
- Hi, Brooke.
- How do you do?

114
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,702
- Hi, Nat, can I have some brass?
- For what?

115
00:12:08,003 --> 00:12:10,300
- Come on, I'll pay back tomorrow.
- Get out!

116
00:12:11,707 --> 00:12:12,566
Let's go.

117
00:12:24,902 --> 00:12:26,599
- What happened?
- What happended with the music?

118
00:12:28,259 --> 00:12:30,209
- Can I help you?
- Oh, yeah.

119
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,966
- Who's that guy?
- What's he doing?

120
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,467
Relax, you'll like it! I promise! Listen!

121
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:37,266
What do you think for you can change this?

122
00:12:38,687 --> 00:12:39,799
Because you'll like it. See?

123
00:12:42,233 --> 00:12:44,450
Have a good time!

124
00:12:44,451 --> 00:12:45,756
Senorita, let's go!

125
00:12:56,218 --> 00:13:01,166
- What? Oh, oh, no...
- Turn away! And welcome back!

126
00:13:11,719 --> 00:13:15,465
- It's interesting choice of music.
- Yeah? And you bear with bob?

127
00:13:15,466 --> 00:13:16,444
Of course.

128
00:13:25,258 --> 00:13:28,965
So what do you think gonna do after college?

129
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,834
I'm gonna own my recordlabor.

130
00:13:31,787 --> 00:13:34,055
- You think big.
- Why not?

131
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,147
What about you, Natalie?

132
00:13:38,185 --> 00:13:42,122
Oh, I wonder on a magazine.
I wanna be the editor.

133
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,200
Yeah.

134
00:13:43,498 --> 00:13:46,753
My magazine. Why not?
Why not do something amazing?

135
00:13:46,756 --> 00:13:49,720
- Whole life is infront of us.
- Nobody here is look at the state.

136
00:13:49,721 --> 00:13:53,525
- No one wants to do anything, you know try anything new.
- Ja.

137
00:14:06,234 --> 00:14:08,777
Keith.
Keith!

138
00:14:13,176 --> 00:14:15,480
- The lab report is due tomorrow.
- Ah, yes.

139
00:14:15,488 --> 00:14:19,677
But the real pressing question is,
how is Rafael Marques, your boyfriend.

140
00:14:19,712 --> 00:14:21,012
He is not...

141
00:14:21,013 --> 00:14:25,327
Great choice that Rafael!
Brainy stud! Perfect guy! Can't go wrong!

142
00:14:25,328 --> 00:14:27,666
- You were at the brink.
- No.

143
00:14:30,462 --> 00:14:31,596
But you were.

144
00:14:31,597 --> 00:14:35,778
- If you weren't then how would you know?
- Because that's where everyone goes.

145
00:14:37,254 --> 00:14:39,952
- What about the lab report?
- Hop in!

146
00:14:40,553 --> 00:14:43,580
- Come on! I do my best work while I'm driving.
- I have your book.

147
00:14:48,749 --> 00:14:53,653
By heating tin metal...
in air... at a high temperature...

148
00:14:53,753 --> 00:14:58,030
we were produce a tin-oxygen product 
called...

149
00:14:59,656 --> 00:15:00,912
Wait!

150
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:06,000
So we need to convert two masses to moles
and dividing the greater mole quantile by the lesser.

151
00:15:06,324 --> 00:15:11,590
Okay, so... 0,01731 tin,

152
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:14,453
and 0,0350 oxygen.

153
00:15:14,488 --> 00:15:19,693
- So the mole ratio is?
- Mole ratio? What's that?

154
00:15:19,728 --> 00:15:23,222
- It's the thing you have to figure out.
- But you are already knowing the answer.

155
00:15:25,193 --> 00:15:27,380
Oh, come on, you're being a jerk!
I need to be back in office in fifteen minutes.

156
00:15:27,381 --> 00:15:32,700
What's the rush? We're here in a yellow truck,
a road ahead of us and nothing but opportunities.

157
00:15:33,053 --> 00:15:35,590
- Okay, what opportunities...?
- Choose a place!

158
00:15:35,591 --> 00:15:39,075
- Pick a place! Right now! At random!
- Okay, I choose...

159
00:15:39,076 --> 00:15:41,610
...the third point on our lab report
calculating the mole ratio.

160
00:15:41,645 --> 00:15:44,499
I can't concentrate driving in a straight 
line like this, this is not gonna work.

161
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,175
- Then turn!
- Where?

162
00:15:46,176 --> 00:15:47,044
Anywhere.

163
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:49,942
Wow! Very funny.

164
00:15:51,584 --> 00:15:53,861
The mole ratio therefore is two to one.

165
00:15:53,862 --> 00:15:57,729
But now we need to find potential 
oxidation numbers of tin and oxygen.

166
00:15:58,568 --> 00:15:59,800
Which are?

167
00:16:00,925 --> 00:16:03,200
It's time for our picnic scene.

168
00:16:07,239 --> 00:16:08,480
Keith!

169
00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:13,450
There he is! How's it going?

170
00:16:14,908 --> 00:16:16,379
Move along, dear!

171
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:23,860
In case you haven't heard picnics
they usually take place outdoors.

172
00:16:24,359 --> 00:16:26,643
Oh, is that what it says 
in the official picnic rule book?

173
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:34,730
This's not funny.

174
00:16:38,429 --> 00:16:43,985
Do you think our check is ready yet?
I know, my pumpkin love, I'm pissed off too.

175
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:47,840
Can you believe this shit? 
It's been three months since that accident.

176
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:50,730
The nerve...

177
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:58,455
- Take me back to school now!
- Yeah! Let's go back to the library

178
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:01,400
and finish lab report in a safe,
acceptable way like everybody else.

179
00:17:03,472 --> 00:17:06,160
Bone grafts are really starting to kick in now.

180
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,020
Hey, Ralph!

181
00:17:22,289 --> 00:17:23,666
No, thanks.

182
00:17:25,192 --> 00:17:28,230
- You said two one right for the mole ratio?
- Yeah.

183
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,560
Duke.

184
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,200
- You'll give a job like this one day?
- God, no.

185
00:17:36,534 --> 00:17:41,126
- My dad used to work in a place like this.
- Ah, yes. Daddy Anderson.

186
00:17:41,127 --> 00:17:46,418
An accountant? A salesman? 
A Norwegian fisherman!

187
00:17:47,042 --> 00:17:51,677
District manager for a phonecall company.
You're not very good at reading minds.

188
00:17:51,743 --> 00:17:54,320
Well, that's 'cause I wasn't really trying.

189
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:08,345
He manages stacks of paper. Moving them from 
side to side, every day, he hates his job.

190
00:18:08,463 --> 00:18:12,532
When he was your age he dreamed of 
going to Duke but they rejected him.

191
00:18:12,567 --> 00:18:18,115
So he poured over every detail of your application,
night after night, until you finally got it right.

192
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:23,700
Natalie Anderson, the star of the household,
who loves beeing in the center of the attention.

193
00:18:24,284 --> 00:18:28,600
She just wished it din't mean 
having to play tennis all of the time.

194
00:18:29,003 --> 00:18:30,410
How am I doing on?

195
00:18:32,512 --> 00:18:34,190
Okay.

196
00:18:44,141 --> 00:18:46,000
Actually this's not so bad.

197
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,600
Can I help you?

198
00:18:53,584 --> 00:18:59,300
We just... are waiting for Mr. Richardson.
He said he'd to finnish a phone call.

199
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:02,733
Okay.

200
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,490
- Goddamn that Richardson!
- Yeah.

201
00:19:08,715 --> 00:19:10,310
Who's he thinking of him, that monkey?

202
00:19:10,496 --> 00:19:13,413
I'm sick of this shit! You know, tabby?
We're goin' straight to the top!

203
00:19:13,414 --> 00:19:15,820
We're gettin' this monkey ass FIRED!

204
00:19:18,106 --> 00:19:23,480
- ...allways take excuses, bullshit! We'd never payed out.
- We just have to be patient, honey.

205
00:19:24,873 --> 00:19:29,756
Okay, so you're an only child. 
Your Mom works for a diaryfresh. Your Dad is a...

206
00:19:29,757 --> 00:19:34,430
... a buliding-constructor and you live 
in a ranch house. So how am I doing?

207
00:19:35,344 --> 00:19:38,402
Actually, I have two brothers, three sisters,

208
00:19:39,103 --> 00:19:42,989
my dad works in real estate, mom helps near
and we live in a farmhouse.

209
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:44,633
Where are you, my beautiful?

210
00:19:45,552 --> 00:19:47,960
In a big old farmhouse.

211
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:50,281
Where?

212
00:19:51,308 --> 00:19:55,850
- Where do you live?
- Beaver Creek, off the Route ten.

213
00:19:57,448 --> 00:19:58,926
That old white house?

214
00:19:58,927 --> 00:20:01,215
- With big front porch?
- With big front porch.

215
00:20:02,676 --> 00:20:04,355
Oh, that's such a great place.

216
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:07,210
That's where I live.

217
00:20:07,978 --> 00:20:10,720
Okay, this is nice, but it's not enough to fill two pages.

218
00:20:10,721 --> 00:20:13,635
Okay, but this is all of our pictures that we have.

219
00:20:13,804 --> 00:20:19,250
Oh, really? Okay, would you mind you just like 
draw something, and turn on page 2., 
because this is not enough to fit...

220
00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:21,980
- Okay, I'll take pics for tomorrow, okay?
- Okay, thank you.

221
00:20:25,581 --> 00:20:29,980
- So were you with that freak?
- He's not a freak. Did Raff cut?

222
00:20:30,488 --> 00:20:34,217
- Well, you said that you'll back to be there.
- It wasn't actually a definite plan.

223
00:20:34,624 --> 00:20:37,235
- I'd told to him you have to be a date.
- Did he say anything?

224
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:41,099
Oh, just that his parents will going out 
tonight and he wanna do a pool-party.

225
00:20:41,134 --> 00:20:44,534
- Cool.
- And he sounded really pissed you'd bulled him off.

226
00:20:44,628 --> 00:20:47,929
- Natalie, what are you doing with this face?
- A lab report.

227
00:20:47,964 --> 00:20:51,966
Oh, really? And you just decided it'll be fine
if you left me here the all full of this shit?

228
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:54,634
- It lasted record time.
- Because the lab report was so exciting?

229
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,444
I had to get it down. What's your problem?

230
00:20:57,561 --> 00:21:00,257
- I'm saving a really shity day.
- What?

231
00:21:00,258 --> 00:21:03,830
- Skinny envelope.
- Notre Dame? Oh, shit!

232
00:21:03,831 --> 00:21:06,807
- Wait-listed.
- Really?

233
00:21:06,831 --> 00:21:10,600
Oh, take supplied three percent for waitlists will
place, this is basically you'd rejection.

234
00:21:10,623 --> 00:21:13,777
- No, no, we can out suffed to the application.
- Yeah, and what can I exactly do?

235
00:21:13,812 --> 00:21:15,208
You can tell that the Notre Dame was 
your first choice school

236
00:21:15,243 --> 00:21:18,730
and we'll get an other letter recommendation
from the faculty. It makes this happened.

237
00:21:18,845 --> 00:21:22,380
- Your power of positive thinking?
- Right.

238
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:27,490
Hi, Raff.

239
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:32,023
Who else has gonna go?
I've to do that tennis match.

240
00:21:32,251 --> 00:21:34,849
Maybe afterwards if there is time.

241
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:37,860
Okay. Bye!

242
00:21:40,449 --> 00:21:42,240
Everything is told in our control.

243
00:21:59,187 --> 00:22:00,340
Come on, girl!

244
00:22:03,136 --> 00:22:05,033
Yeah! Come on, Natalie!

245
00:22:53,601 --> 00:23:01,522
The van der Waals-stated 
subexctraction experiment. Okay? 
A milliard of forces causes into molecule-attractions.

246
00:23:01,523 --> 00:23:08,390
The strenght of these attractions is 
independent on several factors.
Understanding this forces is...

247
00:23:08,391 --> 00:23:10,030
Oh, God!

248
00:23:11,061 --> 00:23:13,545
- Be careful would you?
- I'm gonna be in trouble for that?

249
00:23:14,449 --> 00:23:16,380
Are you gonna punish me for this?

250
00:23:20,426 --> 00:23:24,570
- I might have to.
- 'Cause you know how I feel about all that stuff.

251
00:23:25,122 --> 00:23:27,980
Look, partner, you know the deal.

252
00:23:30,407 --> 00:23:32,566
But those spiky heels really hurt me...

253
00:23:34,972 --> 00:23:40,841
Keith, you've been a bad boy and
now you're gonna have to pay the price.

254
00:23:45,464 --> 00:23:46,612
Do you mind?

255
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:53,449
- So we're on five P.M.?
- For what?

256
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:56,499
- A bowling-scene.
- Bowling? Are you serious?

257
00:23:56,734 --> 00:23:59,162
- I'm going out.
- Tomorrow.

258
00:23:59,163 --> 00:24:01,872
- Keith, I can't.
- It's not a date.

259
00:24:01,873 --> 00:24:04,380
- Keith, maybe sometime...
- Friday?

260
00:24:05,587 --> 00:24:08,012
I'll just schedule it with your assistant!

261
00:24:09,938 --> 00:24:11,300
Okay, you do that!

262
00:24:26,111 --> 00:24:27,056
Did you wrote it?

263
00:24:27,156 --> 00:24:30,574
I've swapped the second into two paragraphs
and I've got out that stuff about history product.

264
00:24:30,575 --> 00:24:33,675
It's a really bullshit, we don't really need that.
But I've filled in other things too.

265
00:24:33,676 --> 00:24:34,989
- Great.
- I'm sending to you right now.

266
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:37,186
- Yes sir, editor in chief.
- Natalie, phone!

267
00:24:37,187 --> 00:24:39,500
I gotta go. It looks really really good.

268
00:24:39,501 --> 00:24:40,890
- Oh, it makes no difference.
- No, this will work!

269
00:24:40,891 --> 00:24:42,400
- It's well!
- I'd got it.

270
00:24:42,654 --> 00:24:44,632
- Alright, we'll talk to later. Bye!
- Bye!

271
00:24:48,844 --> 00:24:51,688
- Hello?
- It would not be a date.

272
00:24:52,621 --> 00:24:56,530
- Who is this?
- It's only bowling. Comme on, what were you so afraid of?

273
00:24:58,344 --> 00:25:00,189
Keith... hi.

274
00:25:00,194 --> 00:25:03,934
Look, I'll pick you up at five P.M. tomorrow after school.

275
00:25:04,593 --> 00:25:09,900
- Did you happen to do the homework?
- Homework? ...Homework?

276
00:25:09,901 --> 00:25:12,700
It's your turn to write up the lab notes, 
don't you remember?

277
00:25:13,272 --> 00:25:16,267
- You're screwin' with my grade here.
- Yeah and you're changing the subject!

278
00:25:16,268 --> 00:25:18,180
I told you, I have plans.

279
00:25:18,181 --> 00:25:22,400
Ah, look, you'll be home at nine o'clock,
then you'll have time for date afterwards.

280
00:25:22,526 --> 00:25:26,000
- We'll see you in school.
- What... maybe.

281
00:25:26,001 --> 00:25:27,288
With the lab notes...

282
00:25:29,308 --> 00:25:33,766
- So who's on the phone?
- Oh, my lab partner.

283
00:25:34,253 --> 00:25:36,507
- Did you have a nice time?
- Yeah.

284
00:25:37,584 --> 00:25:39,837
- What's his name?
- Keith.

285
00:25:40,959 --> 00:25:45,616
- Keith? Oh, I thought...
- Rafael. His name is Rafael.

286
00:25:45,618 --> 00:25:47,430
- The South-American boy?
- Yes.

287
00:25:48,318 --> 00:25:50,500
Why aren't you inviting him for dinner sometime?
We'd love to meet him.

288
00:25:51,166 --> 00:25:55,093
Okay. Sure. It's really nice.

289
00:25:55,094 --> 00:25:59,040
- So who is Keith?
- Oh, he's nobody. He's just my lab partner.

290
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,958
"A: It's not a date.
B: You are my lab partner.

291
00:26:07,959 --> 00:26:10,935
C: Just to see..."
Clever.

292
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:16,781
"D: Bowling is the most popular sport in 
America and it is important that we fit in.

293
00:26:16,782 --> 00:26:22,050
E: It's not and will never be a date."
What is it? He like stucking you, or something?

294
00:26:22,169 --> 00:26:24,567
- So what should we do about him?
- Oh, simple...

295
00:26:30,606 --> 00:26:36,945

quiet greater expect one of the world

300
00:26:56,341 --> 00:26:58,535

301
00:26:58,694 --> 00:27:03,199
Personally I'm interested in a quiet deeper 
appreciating with french wine-drinking heritages.

302
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,898
And how about the Amsterdam weaken bequeath?

- Well, we'll figure out something else.
- Thanks.

310
00:27:39,475 --> 00:27:40,436
I don't know...

311
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:45,690
You really wanna base your relationship with 
a great guy like Raff on lies and deceit?

312
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,690
Why don't you tell him the truth?

313
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,614
You're spending a couple of 
hours with your lab partner.

314
00:27:56,533 --> 00:27:59,333
- What I do with Raff is none of your business.
- My point exactly.

315
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:03,846
- I thought we're going bowling.
- We're saving now.

316
00:28:14,312 --> 00:28:18,438
- Do you believe it or not, there are bowling balls on the bowling line.
- But not like these babies.

317
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:23,132
Cosmo, Patsy...

318
00:28:24,613 --> 00:28:27,665
- A Walt ball.
- But we only need two.

319
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:30,333
If we were just bowling.

320
00:28:51,313 --> 00:28:57,000
- Andy is an artist.
- That's great, but you've no any time.

321
00:28:57,821 --> 00:28:59,523
First thing's first.

322
00:29:07,179 --> 00:29:10,531
- You'll fixed it up with scrap parts?
- There aren't all scrap parts.

323
00:29:10,532 --> 00:29:14,091
- We're creating life in that hadn't been matter.
- You and Andy?

324
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:15,522
I and my Dad.

325
00:29:18,019 --> 00:29:19,960
- Are you close with your Dad?
- Hold this by there!

326
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:21,730
Are you?

327
00:29:22,563 --> 00:29:26,143
He was alive before the days there 
weren't electronic ignition. I need him.

328
00:29:26,446 --> 00:29:30,800
So this truck is... your thing.

329
00:29:30,801 --> 00:29:34,401
- Yeah, it's my thing.
- Interesting...

330
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:41,724
You're so talented, Keith!
You're so much academic potential!

331
00:29:41,725 --> 00:29:44,302
What are you doing wasting your time in a damn truck?

332
00:29:44,303 --> 00:29:47,920
Well, I did't say that, but... it's kind of true.

333
00:29:48,952 --> 00:29:53,200
Don't listen to her honey bun! She's just jealous.

334
00:29:53,982 --> 00:29:56,730
So... she's your girlfriend.

335
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,012
Look, you're out of time. 
I gotta go. No bowling tonight.

336
00:30:14,074 --> 00:30:16,010
Keep going! Go around the corner!

337
00:30:17,755 --> 00:30:20,300
He's prompt! I like that in a man!

338
00:30:20,905 --> 00:30:23,773
He's on time and need more and more, baby.

339
00:30:23,774 --> 00:30:25,284
Shut up! Just dirve!

340
00:30:39,877 --> 00:30:43,065
Sneak down the alley to make at 
your boyfriend... sexy.

341
00:30:44,499 --> 00:30:46,910
- Bye!

342
00:30:47,857 --> 00:30:49,300
- Four?

343
00:30:49,997 --> 00:30:51,720
He'll be gone by then, right?

344
00:30:53,691 --> 00:30:56,030
What a wicked do we at 4 A.M.?

345
00:30:58,001 --> 00:31:01,000
- Keith?
- It's not a date.

346
00:31:10,894 --> 00:31:14,191
I'll pick you up right here! 
At our secret spot!

347
00:31:42,962 --> 00:31:46,694
What?
What it?

348
00:31:47,332 --> 00:31:51,079
- Were you've done this before?
- Kissed?

349
00:31:56,996 --> 00:32:02,200
- It could be a problem for you?
- I just don't think this can work any more, Natalie.

350
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:05,725
- Oh My God!
- What? I was kidding!

351
00:32:07,301 --> 00:32:08,920
I'm kidding...

352
00:32:13,166 --> 00:32:16,032
You know it's listening really cheesy but

353
00:32:16,033 --> 00:32:19,720
- when I do that, I just wanna to be...
- Oh, don't rush! I've gonna be all covered.

354
00:32:19,721 --> 00:32:22,712
We'll have a heart-ship bed that I ordered
and there will be candles...

355
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:25,630
- You know what I'm talking about!
- I know, I know...

356
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:32,930
- Hey, don't rush okay?
- Thanks.

357
00:33:28,018 --> 00:33:31,105
Just think, years from now you're going to have a big huge family

358
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:32,370
and you're gonna wanna share stories

359
00:33:32,372 --> 00:33:37,300
and one of the stories will be that when you were in high school 
put a bowling ball at your chemistry teacher's front porch.

360
00:33:38,058 --> 00:33:39,837
And his name was Walt.

361
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:42,158
I refuse!

362
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:48,850
Go! Go!

363
00:33:50,272 --> 00:33:51,888
Get out, you really jerk!

364
00:34:17,274 --> 00:34:20,965
- His last name is Marques.
- It's the thought that counts.

365
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:41,115
- We've been so screwed.
- Ah, yeah.

366
00:34:41,116 --> 00:34:45,910
- If we're caught just swallow one of these!
- It's not funny shit head!

367
00:34:57,128 --> 00:34:58,380
So who gets these?

368
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:07,100
Well, you can't give up now,

369
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:10,190
Patsy, you're gonna be state champion!

370
00:35:13,781 --> 00:35:17,590
My daddy won't let me, Cosmo.

371
00:35:18,235 --> 00:35:20,800
What's your daddy know about your bowling?

372
00:35:21,314 --> 00:35:25,087
Well he's godly in at all
you know and to him it's just a game

373
00:35:25,088 --> 00:35:28,600
- and to hang games is the devil's handiwork.
- Patsy, you are the greatest!

374
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:31,676
- You can make the nationals!
- I gotta respect my daddy's wishes.

375
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:33,333
He's had a hard life.

376
00:35:34,368 --> 00:35:36,690
Particularly killed himself
raise us nine kids.

377
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,450
- There was my last game.
- Well, darling...

378
00:35:43,799 --> 00:35:45,870
then it was my last game too.

379
00:35:49,336 --> 00:35:50,499
"Dear waitress,

380
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:55,333
please find a home for our balls.

381
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:58,583
Cosmo and Patsy."

382
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:07,666
- This is the saddest day of our lives.
- Indeed it is.

383
00:36:45,241 --> 00:36:49,000
- Natie!
- What's up?

384
00:36:49,577 --> 00:36:54,182
I'm just putting in your last match.
You're now right 14th.

385
00:36:54,183 --> 00:36:57,360
- Take a look!
- I believe you.

386
00:36:58,008 --> 00:37:01,060
If you're staying in the top twenty,
you'll sent to that scholarship.

387
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,459
- Dad!
- What?

388
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:07,017
- Did you apply the Duke?
- Actually yes I did.

389
00:37:07,801 --> 00:37:11,778
I did't get in. It was very compared of year.

390
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:15,658
You'd ever think about doing something different?

391
00:37:16,762 --> 00:37:17,570
Different?

392
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,600
- For work.
- Such as?

393
00:37:19,601 --> 00:37:23,301
- Something you may actually enjoy.
- Like what?

394
00:37:23,302 --> 00:37:24,830
- Dad!
- What?

395
00:37:31,188 --> 00:37:36,184
He's smart, confident, really hard.

396
00:37:37,592 --> 00:37:39,350
I kinda think he's perfect.

397
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:45,400
- So what did you do last night?
- Oh, we just plunged on and talked.

398
00:37:46,029 --> 00:37:50,050
Few other things... 
Not that!

399
00:37:51,002 --> 00:37:53,956
It's great that Raff is absolutely no presser.

400
00:37:54,717 --> 00:37:57,881
- So there's that Courtney was illusinating?
- What?

401
00:37:57,882 --> 00:38:01,928
She said she saw you with Keith 
Zetterstrom on straight street.

402
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,699
- Oh, well I hung out with him a little bit too.
- Oh!?

403
00:38:09,262 --> 00:38:12,377
- What? I'm not can have whatever friends?
- Not who were stucking you.

404
00:38:13,507 --> 00:38:16,874
Keith is cool, he just, he does things in own way.

405
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:22,900
It's kinda perfect actually. It's Keith keeps me busy
and not were get at all upset about Raff.

406
00:38:22,928 --> 00:38:24,200
It works so.

407
00:38:26,084 --> 00:38:29,200
Alright, hey, if it works so for you, it's just great.

408
00:38:30,279 --> 00:38:31,500
It does.

409
00:38:33,756 --> 00:38:35,865
I gotta go. I've got tennis.

410
00:38:36,375 --> 00:38:38,566
- Bye!
- Call you later.

411
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,010
Do you speak spanish?

412
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:46,200
It's superb!

413
00:38:47,163 --> 00:38:49,855
- Are you learning any languages at the school?
- French.

414
00:38:54,012 --> 00:38:59,040
- So have you ever been to Italy?
- Oh, yeah, I actually I stayed live there a couple of years.

415
00:38:59,467 --> 00:39:02,555
We're planning a trip there. It's my dream.

416
00:39:02,789 --> 00:39:06,567
Oh, yeah! I recommend!
Florence is one of my favourite cites.

417
00:39:07,903 --> 00:39:10,898
Natalie tells that your planning is to attending to Penn State.

418
00:39:11,278 --> 00:39:14,023
Oh, actually it's UPENN.

419
00:39:19,815 --> 00:39:21,522
As she told that you're quite a sportman.

420
00:39:21,523 --> 00:39:24,555
Oh, yeah, I've play football ever since when I was lower kid.

421
00:39:24,633 --> 00:39:27,600
- Oh, you know Pete was a... tell...
- Not...

422
00:39:28,028 --> 00:39:31,660
Okay, he was a great football player at the college.

423
00:39:32,361 --> 00:39:34,670
I wasn't a great football player. I only played football.

424
00:39:35,196 --> 00:39:36,223
Oh, soccer?

425
00:39:38,199 --> 00:39:39,156
Football.

426
00:39:44,749 --> 00:39:46,212
- Bon appétit!

427
00:39:55,463 --> 00:39:59,930

- Something can be arranged.

430
00:40:08,666 --> 00:40:11,840
- Just you and me... and the fireplace...

431
00:40:11,842 --> 00:40:16,555
...we really need to talk. 
I need be honestly to how I feel about this.

433
00:40:24,162 --> 00:40:26,866
Well, I actually thought you're waiting...

00:41:14,656 --> 00:41:18,281
- He just does shit like this.
- Isn't he a little...?

446
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:22,052
- Something like that.
- He's crushed on you.

447
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:25,310
- He's crushed on his truck.
- Oh, whatever, just...

448
00:41:25,721 --> 00:41:28,312
- ...don't encourage.
- I don't!

449
00:41:28,347 --> 00:41:31,378
- Shit!
- Are you ready to go?

450
00:41:32,078 --> 00:41:33,927
- Actually I have to take a shower.
- ... (=Am I awaiting you)?

451
00:41:34,027 --> 00:41:36,334
No, that's alright. You go ahead!
I'll been there.

452
00:41:36,335 --> 00:41:37,050
Alright. Goodbye!

453
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:37,850
- Bye!
- Bye!

454
00:41:47,076 --> 00:41:50,398
Keith! We need to talk.

455
00:41:50,864 --> 00:41:54,000
- Hop in!
- I'm not going to anywhere with you.

456
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:57,657
Cool, well then I'll come inside and
watch TV with Pete and Caroline.

457
00:41:58,216 --> 00:42:00,648
No. No.

458
00:42:02,033 --> 00:42:02,834
No!

459
00:42:04,643 --> 00:42:08,661
- You can't just deliver shit into my house like that!
- But it works, didn't it?

460
00:42:09,602 --> 00:42:13,003
Listen, I like you.
I like being friends with you.

461
00:42:13,004 --> 00:42:15,789
But therefore we hang out from now I want
I gotta be a part of your plans!

462
00:42:15,790 --> 00:42:17,445
- See, but there are no plans!
- Bullshit!

463
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:19,920
- You've got some whole scenario worked out.
- Is that what you think?

464
00:42:19,921 --> 00:42:24,585
- Yeah, and you can't just expect me that drop 
everything because you decided you wanna do some...
- I don't expect you to do anything!

465
00:42:25,027 --> 00:42:27,974
You're free go at anytime! In fact,

466
00:42:27,975 --> 00:42:31,445
what is Nathalie Anderson doing 
hanging out a truck geek like me anyway?

467
00:42:35,424 --> 00:42:38,336
This is cool. This is the scene 
where we're at the crossroads.

468
00:42:39,001 --> 00:42:40,130
You're being a jerk.

469
00:42:40,131 --> 00:42:43,336
Oh, come on, miss bellequeen! 
Stud boyfriend, tennis champ!

470
00:42:44,345 --> 00:42:46,420
Don't you have better things to do on a Friday night?

471
00:42:47,229 --> 00:42:49,597
Just go, leave, get out here!

472
00:43:02,030 --> 00:43:05,101
You know I thought you're different,
but you're not different.

473
00:43:05,102 --> 00:43:09,601
You're just another immature little boy!
You're right.

474
00:43:10,357 --> 00:43:13,000
I'm wasting my time here.

475
00:43:21,811 --> 00:43:24,323
And what about you?
Mr. Egomaniac?

476
00:43:24,927 --> 00:43:28,200
Why are you always giving me gifts and 
writing clever little notes all of the time?

477
00:43:29,419 --> 00:43:31,522
Why don't you leave?

478
00:43:31,975 --> 00:43:34,500
- Go ahead! Drive away right now!
- There's Keith! Stop, Al!

479
00:43:37,594 --> 00:43:38,230
Keith!

480
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:39,720
Keith, swap!

481
00:43:39,927 --> 00:43:44,191
They got me Super Smash Brothers and Gran Turismo 3. 
And they're beating each other up, these guys allways...

482
00:43:44,308 --> 00:43:46,691
- That's great, I'll to show you!
- Billy. Billy. Hi, Al.

483
00:43:46,692 --> 00:43:51,043
- I've got Mario and Luigi and they battling each other...
- Go on. Great. Listen, this is, Sophie.

484
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:54,730
- Natalie.
- Hi! I'm Al.

485
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:57,848
She's a double agent, you can't trust her.

486
00:43:57,849 --> 00:44:02,356
- they got all these monsters that are 
battling and clashing at each other and...
- Oh, good. 'Cause I'm gonna kick your ass!

487
00:44:02,357 --> 00:44:05,600
I'll kick your ass!
Come on, let's get out here! Come on!

488
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:08,253
- Let's go to your house!
- Billy... you know... Billy...

489
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:11,189
I'm on specially assignment tonight.
How-how about tomorrow?

490
00:44:11,207 --> 00:44:13,320
- No, I got school tomorrow! Come on, let's go!
- Billy, we gotta go!

491
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,010
- Come on, sleep one more night there! One more!
- Billy, stand out the car right now!

492
00:44:17,011 --> 00:44:20,036
- My parents don't care!
- Come on! Next time.

493
00:44:20,037 --> 00:44:21,500
- Oh, no...
- Come on.

494
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:27,538
- Are we talking, Keith?
- Hang in there, Al.

495
00:44:28,388 --> 00:44:29,500
You're doing just fine.

496
00:44:36,093 --> 00:44:38,120
- Kick your ass!
- Kick your ass!

497
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:53,393
- So how do you know them?
- The neighborhood.

498
00:44:55,913 --> 00:44:58,625
Billy is what? Hyperactive or something?

499
00:45:00,276 --> 00:45:05,414
So you're his counselor? 
Tutor? Something like that?

500
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:10,520
Such a guy...

501
00:45:13,065 --> 00:45:14,999
...turns out you aren't softie.

502
00:45:25,203 --> 00:45:26,520
So, what is it?

503
00:45:27,173 --> 00:45:31,366
Church programm?
The Y? Volunteer thing?

504
00:45:35,450 --> 00:45:39,350
Let's get out here!
Come on, scap!

505
00:45:41,433 --> 00:45:45,617
We've got a yellow truck,
the road in front of us...

506
00:45:47,128 --> 00:45:49,700
and nothing but opportunities, right?

507
00:46:10,113 --> 00:46:12,100
Turn right up here! 
Right here! This dirt road up ahead!

508
00:46:13,230 --> 00:46:15,722
Come on! What?

509
00:46:16,111 --> 00:46:19,390
- Why here?
- Why?

510
00:46:20,287 --> 00:46:22,160
It's not supposed to be a why, right?

511
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:25,400
Were you scared?

512
00:46:32,023 --> 00:46:36,520
- Wow! Slow down!
- Just funny. Really funny.

513
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:39,950
- What?
- You chose this road.

514
00:46:48,054 --> 00:46:51,535
So that's the Brink! 
I've never been on this side.

515
00:46:51,983 --> 00:46:56,450
- I've never been on that side.
- You're not missing much.

516
00:46:57,360 --> 00:47:00,530
Really? I thought you're the Brink Queen.

517
00:47:01,010 --> 00:47:03,230
It's getting on really old.

518
00:47:03,251 --> 00:47:08,660
It's all about what you're wearing and who's 
hooking up with who and showing off your boyfriend.

519
00:47:08,661 --> 00:47:11,237
- Many essential information.
- Oh, yeah.

520
00:47:12,344 --> 00:47:15,268
Down there they live and die by that crap.

521
00:47:19,661 --> 00:47:21,400
But up here it's like...

522
00:47:22,851 --> 00:47:24,944
...what have I ever care.

523
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:35,770
- You don't...
- What?

524
00:47:36,785 --> 00:47:40,445
You don't care what people think.
You're just...

525
00:47:40,883 --> 00:47:42,145
...you.

526
00:47:47,870 --> 00:47:50,940
- Whatever that is.
- It's a good thing.

527
00:47:52,849 --> 00:47:54,363
Really good thing.

528
00:47:58,208 --> 00:48:00,333
So do you come here a lot?

529
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:04,688
Cool.

530
00:48:04,689 --> 00:48:07,440
- I found your place.
- I don't know how you did.

531
00:48:07,441 --> 00:48:09,490
Chances are probably one in a billion.

532
00:48:11,743 --> 00:48:13,686
Stranger things have happened, right?

533
00:48:33,665 --> 00:48:35,290
You know... we should probably leave.

534
00:48:36,626 --> 00:48:38,760
- Yeah.
- We're lab partners.

535
00:48:38,878 --> 00:48:41,021
- Yeah.
- This is strictly a lab partnership.

536
00:48:41,142 --> 00:48:44,654
- Absolutely.
- And Walter would be very very upset right now. So...

537
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,350
- Hello, Raff.
- Hi, beautiful! Are you ready?

538
00:48:59,567 --> 00:49:02,036
I'm so sorry, I've just go ahead from a shower.

539
00:49:03,201 --> 00:49:06,545
Actually... I don't really feel like
to go to the brink tonight.

540
00:49:06,546 --> 00:49:10,190
- Why? What's wrong with the brink?
- Just that we've gone on since last six weeks in a role.

541
00:49:10,191 --> 00:49:12,175
I know but we've promised to Trisha,

542
00:49:12,176 --> 00:49:14,342
- and you know to Robbie.
- We'll see them all the time.

543
00:49:14,648 --> 00:49:18,345
Well, you see me all the time.
So you're sick of me all the time?

544
00:49:18,350 --> 00:49:21,796
Of course I'm not kidding sick of you
I'm just really be (off).

545
00:49:22,342 --> 00:49:25,954
Had a long day, practice after school.
I was getting to call you sooner.

546
00:49:25,989 --> 00:49:30,105
Okay, it's right. Just get some sleep
and we'll hang tomorrow, okay?

547
00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:32,745
- Yeah, see you next happening.
- Okay.

548
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:35,020
- Okay, bye!
- Bye!

549
00:50:13,818 --> 00:50:15,090
- Hi!
- Hi!

550
00:50:15,091 --> 00:50:15,890
Natalie!

551
00:50:16,101 --> 00:50:18,620
- Guess, where can I be next year!
- Notre Dame!

552
00:50:20,995 --> 00:50:22,880
That's great!

553
00:50:23,832 --> 00:50:25,934
We have to celebrate this!

554
00:51:17,629 --> 00:51:21,600
- Okay, partner, now I've got a scene.
- Shoot!

555
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:24,300
It's the scene where you tell me the truth.

556
00:51:26,103 --> 00:51:27,690
The big confession scene.

557
00:51:29,995 --> 00:51:32,650
What are you doing after finish highschool?
Really.

558
00:51:35,770 --> 00:51:38,625
- I'm going to London.
- London?

559
00:51:39,206 --> 00:51:42,210
Me too! With Raff and Brooke and Travis! 
We should meet up!

560
00:51:42,211 --> 00:51:43,837
Not that London.

561
00:51:45,271 --> 00:51:49,330
London Ontario. It's a classic 
truckshow there every year in July.

562
00:51:50,009 --> 00:51:54,223
- So you really are truck geek.
- You see I open up to you and you dump on me.

563
00:51:54,404 --> 00:51:58,700
No, just because I know you have dreams
more than a truck show.

564
00:52:01,115 --> 00:52:04,988
- The sky's the limit, right?
- Yeah, actually it is.

565
00:52:04,989 --> 00:52:05,900
You, sure?

566
00:52:09,244 --> 00:52:11,734
I'm sure you sell yourself short.

567
00:52:25,111 --> 00:52:28,530
Are we... are we moving?

568
00:52:31,333 --> 00:52:35,810
- We are moving!
- A step for moving into the space on a mission...

569
00:52:35,811 --> 00:52:37,200
Keith, we have a problem.

570
00:52:37,769 --> 00:52:41,400
- I think, there is an untreatable one in the space craft...
- Keith! Get up! Come on!

571
00:52:41,401 --> 00:52:44,530
- Keith, it's gonna go over! Get up!
- He's taken on the body by trusted co-pilot

572
00:52:44,531 --> 00:52:46,407
- called Natalie Anderson...
- Keith! It's gonna go over!

573
00:52:46,408 --> 00:52:48,136
- "It's gonna go over!"
- Come on! What are you doing?

574
00:52:48,137 --> 00:52:51,140
- Keith! Stop it!
- She's just saying: "Keith, stop it!"

575
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:54,423
Keith, come on! 

576
00:52:55,070 --> 00:53:00,750
- Shit! Keith! Hurry up!
- "Get up, Keith. Get up."

577
00:53:00,751 --> 00:53:04,154
Keith, come on, get up or 
you're gonna get killed! Keith!

578
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:07,697
Stop it! Stop the truck! Keith!

579
00:53:13,213 --> 00:53:16,190
What the hell was that?
Are you crazy?!

580
00:53:16,510 --> 00:53:18,660
If you do shit like that,
you could get yourself killed!

581
00:53:18,661 --> 00:53:20,952
Don't mention what would've 
happened to my truck...

582
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:23,650
Oh... oh yeah!

583
00:53:34,870 --> 00:53:36,220
It's true you wanna go over?

584
00:53:38,019 --> 00:53:40,010
- I wasn't even close.
- Yes, you were.

585
00:53:40,727 --> 00:53:43,836
- You don't know how close is.
- Don't give me one of your stupid lines!

586
00:53:44,027 --> 00:53:45,615
I know what close is.

587
00:53:52,206 --> 00:53:54,312
Goodnight, partner.

588
00:54:00,076 --> 00:54:01,640
Take care of yourself, okay?

589
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:49,000
MORPHINE, INDICATED FOR THE TREATMENT OF DEPRESSION

590
00:56:18,574 --> 00:56:22,614
No, not C, Z. Zetterstrom.

591
00:56:24,949 --> 00:56:28,812
Z, E, T, T, E... Are you sure?

592
00:56:29,834 --> 00:56:33,111
- What do you think you do on?
- What?

593
00:56:34,273 --> 00:56:38,614
- Using yourself phone on the school property?
- Hey... don't!

594
00:56:38,615 --> 00:56:41,700
It was Duke, apparently there's 
a problem with my trans courts.

595
00:56:41,707 --> 00:56:45,769
- Oh, so everything is okay?
- Actually I have to go in the front office to deal with this.

596
00:56:46,234 --> 00:56:47,200
Sucks.

597
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:49,100
- Bye!
- Bye!

598
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:55,231
Look, he's not gone for few days now so I was thinking 
I should call him you know get him kinda homework at all.

599
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:57,350
I'm sorry, we don't get out any information.

600
00:56:58,270 --> 00:56:59,892
But it's kind of emergence.

601
00:56:59,893 --> 00:57:03,500
You know Keith is falling behind me,
it's in fact bad for me to perform the APs.

602
00:57:04,192 --> 00:57:06,410
You have to speak to Mr. Miles regarding that.

603
00:57:07,614 --> 00:57:12,100
Okay, look, he's my friend. He's gave me his number,
I'd just losted it. It's really not a big deal.

604
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:15,865
- I'm sorry, I can't.
- Where is he? Why isn't he come?

605
00:57:16,837 --> 00:57:18,770
I'm trying to learn, but he doesn't care!

606
00:57:19,145 --> 00:57:21,740
I think Keith's having a thought time at the moment.

607
00:57:23,830 --> 00:57:26,198
- Thought how?
- Thanks.

608
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:30,190
- That's all I can say really.
- But... is there anything I can do?

609
00:57:30,613 --> 00:57:34,600
- I knew this was a bad idea.
- What?

610
00:57:36,642 --> 00:57:40,155
- What?
- Partner on your guys.

611
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:41,800
But it was random.

612
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:47,690
He chosed me?

613
00:57:49,906 --> 00:57:54,934
- Keith chosed me?
- I'll make sure he gets your notes.

614
00:58:25,706 --> 00:58:28,100

615
00:58:29,143 --> 00:58:31,745
Randy Randerson's managed to set into final match.

616
00:59:04,399 --> 00:59:07,155
- Wanna I come in?
- Maybe. No.

617
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:10,823
Shit, I don't know. I think, I just 
to get some sleep, or something.

618
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:13,756
Are you puzzle with Keith?

619
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:17,900
- Where that come from?
- Do you?

620
00:59:17,933 --> 00:59:21,591
As the matter in fact I have 
absolutely zero plans with Keith.

621
00:59:21,592 --> 00:59:24,185
- But you were hanging with him.
- I hang with a lot of people.

622
00:59:24,581 --> 00:59:26,600
Is there any wrong with that?
I'm only had to be seen with you?

623
00:59:26,601 --> 00:59:29,230
No, no. Relax, okay?
The match is over.

624
00:59:32,206 --> 00:59:34,910
Sorry. It's just a screwed day.

625
00:59:35,258 --> 00:59:36,465
So everything is okay?

626
00:59:36,636 --> 00:59:40,794
He's just my lab partner and my friend. 
Actually he's not even my friend

627
00:59:40,795 --> 00:59:45,580
- so can we just let it go?
- Yeah, whatever.

628
00:59:47,060 --> 00:59:48,690
So we'll talk to later.

629
01:00:07,757 --> 01:00:09,704
Natalie, we have to talk!

630
01:00:11,205 --> 01:00:14,560
I've lost a match.
Get over, Mom!

631
01:00:14,700 --> 01:00:18,400
Natalie, come back!
Natalie, I'm talking to you!

632
01:01:29,943 --> 01:01:32,680
- Yeah?
- Hi! Is Keith home?

633
01:01:33,083 --> 01:01:35,170
- Keith?
- I'm his lab partner.

634
01:01:35,173 --> 01:01:37,770
- May I help you?
- Are you Mr. Zetterstrom?

635
01:01:38,990 --> 01:01:43,200
- Mr. who?
- This is the Zetterstrom house?

636
01:01:43,649 --> 01:01:45,769
My name is Don. Don Sope.

637
01:01:48,328 --> 01:01:51,794
Sorry. Wrong house.

638
01:02:12,745 --> 01:02:16,870
Oh, quiz! Sweet! What timing.

639
01:02:17,755 --> 01:02:20,340
Morning, Walt! Thank you.

640
01:02:33,934 --> 01:02:38,423
Hey, partner, thanks for those notes,
I killed that quiz.

641
01:02:38,666 --> 01:02:42,240
- Where have you been the last two weeks?
- Last two weeks?

642
01:02:42,851 --> 01:02:46,600
- What, do you come here every day?
- There's some wrong with you, isn't there?

643
01:02:46,601 --> 01:02:52,053
Yeah, yeah there is, with me,
definitely with you,

644
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:55,943
- with this sexy little freshman right here.
- I don't wanna be funny anymore, Keith.

645
01:02:56,616 --> 01:02:59,700
Oh, well I hate to break it to you, Anderson
but you've never really been funny to begin, right?

646
01:02:59,709 --> 01:03:02,490
What are you? Depressed or something?

647
01:03:02,491 --> 01:03:05,246
Depressed? Yes, throw that out there.
Chicks find it incredibly sexy.

648
01:03:05,247 --> 01:03:07,010
- I'm being serious, Keith.
- Why?

649
01:03:07,813 --> 01:03:09,266
It never works.

650
01:03:11,630 --> 01:03:13,020
You could have to told me.

651
01:03:14,113 --> 01:03:15,500
Could I told you what?

652
01:03:16,357 --> 01:03:21,511
- That you have problems?
- You don't know the half of them.

653
01:03:25,026 --> 01:03:27,140
- Hey, Raff.
- What's going on?

654
01:03:27,141 --> 01:03:27,945
What?

655
01:03:28,348 --> 01:03:32,390
- The jacket...
- Oh, are you like it? I got it from K-Mart.

656
01:03:32,392 --> 01:03:34,604
Raff, I was cold he lent it to me.

657
01:03:35,245 --> 01:03:39,486
Oh, come on, you don't expect 
him to believe that, do you?

658
01:03:39,777 --> 01:03:43,300
See Raff we're part of this jacket smuggling ring,

659
01:03:43,988 --> 01:03:46,830
but if you're quiet enough I swear 
there's a fleece in it somewhere for you.

660
01:03:46,831 --> 01:03:48,950
- Look, I'm not talking to you, okay?
- Hey, man, don't get mad at me.

661
01:03:48,952 --> 01:03:52,370
- I only a supply dishing, okay? I don't create the demand...
- Shut the hell up!

662
01:03:52,371 --> 01:03:55,646
Raff! Raff, it's just a jacket.
That's it! It's a jacket.

663
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:57,650
This is bullshit!

664
01:04:01,625 --> 01:04:02,500
Raff, wait up!

665
01:04:05,182 --> 01:04:06,500
Marques, it was a joke!

666
01:04:07,698 --> 01:04:10,435
Raff! Raff!

667
01:04:11,396 --> 01:04:13,515
- Was just a jacket, right?
- Yes!

668
01:04:13,516 --> 01:04:15,684
- That's it?
- Of course, that's all it was!

669
01:04:16,282 --> 01:04:17,100
Raff, come on...

670
01:04:19,201 --> 01:04:20,370
I've class.

671
01:04:24,921 --> 01:04:27,312
- So all was just a big joke to you, huh?
- I don't know.

672
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:30,150
- How is it?
- I don't know. I don't know anything anymore.

673
01:04:30,155 --> 01:04:31,620
Why did you choose me your lab partner?

674
01:04:32,500 --> 01:04:35,100
- Me?
- Don't bullshit me! Miles told me!

675
01:04:35,101 --> 01:04:37,800
Walter Miles is CIA, you can't trust him.

676
01:04:38,100 --> 01:04:39,430
- Where do you live?
- What?

677
01:04:40,100 --> 01:04:41,344
Where do you live? 
You've lied about it!

678
01:04:41,373 --> 01:04:43,830
- Are you losing it partner?
- You lied about everything!

679
01:04:43,832 --> 01:04:48,121
'Cause you know what, I've got some great pills that
you can take. But I'm sure you already knew that.

680
01:05:43,261 --> 01:05:46,660
I just don't understand,
Natalie was one of the school's finest students.

681
01:05:47,777 --> 01:05:51,324
- I needed the chemistry notes.
- You know very well that's not the way to get them.

682
01:05:51,325 --> 01:05:54,412
- She made a mistake.
- She's been under a lot of pressure lately with

683
01:05:54,413 --> 01:05:56,457
the tennis, the schedule and the homework...

684
01:05:56,458 --> 01:06:00,300
I'm sorry but the faithing's school 
properties are remarked one week suspension.

685
01:06:00,952 --> 01:06:03,000
- What? What was just to suppose to do...?
- Natalie.

686
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:08,045
- I can make any exceptions to therefore.
- I needed the notes I have to take my AP!

687
01:06:08,510 --> 01:06:11,045
Mr. Miles make sure you get thoes notes.

688
01:06:22,654 --> 01:06:24,890
Just don't make a mass of those things 
what there you worked so hard!

689
01:06:24,893 --> 01:06:26,143
Please, can we leave just not?

690
01:06:26,649 --> 01:06:29,399
- You don't wanna something to tell us?
- Stop the car!

691
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:30,191
What?

692
01:06:30,192 --> 01:06:34,050
- I can't thinking here. I wanna get out!
- You're staying right where you are, missy!

693
01:06:40,100 --> 01:06:41,186
Natalie!

694
01:06:44,127 --> 01:06:46,144
What? The light was red!

695
01:06:56,300 --> 01:06:57,790
- Hi.

696
01:06:59,056 --> 01:07:02,380
...chapter 16th did we in history
and that's the mathematics contrast.

697
01:07:02,381 --> 01:07:04,070
Okay, thanks.

698
01:07:05,373 --> 01:07:07,740
- Are you okay?
- Fine.

699
01:07:08,999 --> 01:07:14,478
- Are you gonna tell me what happened?
- Someting... I've had a hissy fit.

700
01:07:16,658 --> 01:07:21,001
Natalie! You broke in the Keith locker.
And really what were you looking for there?

701
01:07:21,136 --> 01:07:24,600
Oh, that's just great, I'm sure 
you all just gossip in my ass at all.

702
01:07:24,601 --> 01:07:26,340
I'm just tring to help you, okey?

703
01:07:26,346 --> 01:07:29,796
Look, Keith is a loser! He's jealous, and 
he's ovbious just wanna to break you guys up.

704
01:07:29,831 --> 01:07:32,120
- That's ridiculous!
- Raff is pissed.

705
01:07:32,328 --> 01:07:33,373
You'd talked to Raff?

706
01:07:35,037 --> 01:07:36,999
- No, no! Natalie, just listen to me one second!
- Go! Go away!

707
01:07:37,210 --> 01:07:37,900
Natalie!

708
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:41,020
Keith isn't a straight go! 
Why are you let him to broke everything?

709
01:07:43,531 --> 01:07:44,912
I'm going.

710
01:07:45,609 --> 01:07:48,860
- Natalie!
- I'd like to warm up by myself once my life, Mom.

711
01:07:48,936 --> 01:07:50,878
- See you at the match!
- Natalie! I'm not ready!

712
01:07:58,205 --> 01:07:59,582

713
01:08:01,451 --> 01:08:04,604

715
01:08:09,129 --> 01:08:10,646

716
01:08:31,309 --> 01:08:33,845
- I told you I'll talk to you later.
- I wanna know what's going on!

717
01:08:33,900 --> 01:08:35,080
What's going on? That I have a match!

718
01:08:35,100 --> 01:08:37,200
Whatever is you can tell me about it. 
Okey, Natalie?

719
01:08:37,226 --> 01:08:40,200
- It hasn't nothing to do with you.
- Because of it's about to do with Keith?

720
01:08:40,201 --> 01:08:42,023
- It's about me.
- Then it's about me too!

721
01:08:42,024 --> 01:08:44,850
Because there's a little thing about us,
when you ever know this!

722
01:08:44,851 --> 01:08:45,500
I need a little time.

723
01:08:45,501 --> 01:08:47,650
Then we'll get the lake house next weekend,

724
01:08:47,651 --> 01:08:49,673
- I'll call you later!

725
01:08:51,062 --> 01:08:52,054
Idiot!
Check your mind!

726
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,055
Hi!

727
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,655
- Are you Keith's dad?
- Yeah.

728
01:09:41,033 --> 01:09:42,000
Keith.

729
01:09:48,042 --> 01:09:49,494
Keith!

730
01:09:52,540 --> 01:09:54,300
I'm looking what can I do for you.

731
01:09:55,763 --> 01:10:00,756
- Does he have any brothers, sisters?
- No, just two of us.

732
01:10:34,053 --> 01:10:37,500
I'm sorry. He doesn't wanna to see you now.

733
01:10:39,262 --> 01:10:40,500
Okay.

734
01:10:42,649 --> 01:10:43,954
Thanks anyway.

735
01:12:05,300 --> 01:12:06,488
I don't,

736
01:12:07,454 --> 01:12:10,800
I don't care where you're gonna be next year.

737
01:12:11,983 --> 01:12:14,070
I don't care if you're crazy.

738
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:16,965
God...

739
01:12:18,900 --> 01:12:21,400
I just know I wanna to be with you.

740
01:12:25,765 --> 01:12:28,032
I don't understand what you're doing.

741
01:12:34,773 --> 01:12:38,273
It seems so pointless,
I mean everything,

742
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:43,375
it just seems so pointless!
But when I'm with you, it's different,

743
01:12:48,190 --> 01:12:49,430
I don't know why.

744
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:59,121
So we should actually go bowling.

745
01:13:59,700 --> 01:14:02,898
- You know like with lanes and pins.
- Yeah, we should.

746
01:14:03,444 --> 01:14:05,100
- Maybe tomorrow?
- Maybe.

747
01:14:06,100 --> 01:14:08,300
- Are you even gonna be in school tomorrow?
- I don't know.

748
01:14:10,533 --> 01:14:12,909
- I don't know about any this actually.
- What?

749
01:14:14,186 --> 01:14:17,258
I mean a guy like me with a truck

750
01:14:17,259 --> 01:14:19,000
gotta keep movin'.

751
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:20,240
Stop it.

752
01:14:20,241 --> 01:14:22,800
I mean, you know, I'm not really feel
the hold touch thing anyway.

753
01:14:22,802 --> 01:14:25,220
- Shut up!
- You got Raff.

754
01:14:26,350 --> 01:14:30,270
Raff's good guy. Good for you.

755
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:37,250
We should just forget about it.

756
01:14:44,388 --> 01:14:47,999
- Fuck you!
- You just did partner.

757
01:15:27,783 --> 01:15:30,300
If you just fault to fit matches 
what do you expect?

758
01:15:30,900 --> 01:15:33,541
You're weighting grabb 15 points last month.

759
01:15:34,112 --> 01:15:35,122
Great.

760
01:15:35,900 --> 01:15:37,015
That's just perfect.

761
01:15:37,016 --> 01:15:40,950
I would talk to Mr. Richard Honings,
he's a big guy of the DTTA.

762
01:15:40,977 --> 01:15:45,445
No, all we need to do ask for an excuse to a doctor
to write a letter saying you were injured.

763
01:15:46,213 --> 01:15:50,500
- But I wasn't injured.
- This is a 10,000 dollars scholarship we are talking about.

764
01:15:50,501 --> 01:15:53,750
It's not my fault you wanna me to go 
the most expensive school in universe.

765
01:15:53,752 --> 01:15:56,365
- Duke is the best you've ever...
- Why would you sold yourself short?

766
01:15:56,431 --> 01:15:58,269
I needn't finnishing in the other applications.

767
01:15:58,300 --> 01:16:00,987
- Honey, you didn't have to.
- You didn't want me to.

768
01:16:01,192 --> 01:16:04,378
There are billion other schools
and than or I could get a job

769
01:16:04,538 --> 01:16:07,614
- Or something.
- You don't have to a comromise, honey

770
01:16:07,615 --> 01:16:10,111
if we focus on this week the scholarship'll be back.

771
01:16:10,314 --> 01:16:11,430
Maybe I don't wanna give it back.

772
01:16:12,180 --> 01:16:14,828
Maybe I don't wanna play tennis 
for six hours a day at the college.

773
01:16:16,754 --> 01:16:21,026
Maybe I'm sick of it after 10 stupid years!
Thouht I ever cared of you?

774
01:16:21,526 --> 01:16:25,460
Honey, there's no reason to give up on your dream now.

775
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:29,888
- Oh, are you even listening to me?
- It is almost june. It is too late.

776
01:16:31,276 --> 01:16:34,504
You are right!
Everything is just screwed up!

777
01:16:34,805 --> 01:16:38,466
- Hey, we are not done here!
- Come right back here!

778
01:17:14,707 --> 01:17:15,300
Hi.

779
01:17:18,253 --> 01:17:22,145
- We'd met. I was with Keith.
- Oh... hi.

780
01:17:24,553 --> 01:17:28,400
- How is Keith doing?
- I don't really know.

781
01:17:28,689 --> 01:17:30,500
Actually I haven't seen him much.

782
01:17:33,375 --> 01:17:36,276
Does he so see that little boy? Billy?

783
01:17:36,754 --> 01:17:38,323
Billy'd past away.

784
01:17:39,532 --> 01:17:42,292
- May I help you, sir?
- 15 pumple the third please.

785
01:17:42,641 --> 01:17:45,323
- What?
- I'm sorry.

786
01:17:48,193 --> 01:17:52,115
- How to Keith's know him?
- On the chemo they've gona together.

787
01:17:58,630 --> 01:18:02,250
- So you're his doctor...?
- Counsellor.

788
01:18:02,251 --> 01:18:03,405
I was...

789
01:18:06,178 --> 01:18:07,970
But he's gonna be okay, right?

790
01:18:11,967 --> 01:18:14,854
How sick is he? Tell me!

791
01:18:15,849 --> 01:18:19,252
I thought you'd knew.
I'm really sorry.

792
01:18:30,849 --> 01:18:32,843
Keith?

793
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:42,744
Keith.

794
01:18:45,652 --> 01:18:46,868
Please come outside!

795
01:18:51,548 --> 01:18:55,551
Keith, come on!
Keith, open the door!

796
01:18:55,552 --> 01:18:57,970
Let's talk to you please!

797
01:19:00,076 --> 01:19:01,962
Keith...

798
01:19:06,323 --> 01:19:09,620
- Thanks for calling.
- Sorry. I've to try to figure things out.

799
01:19:09,621 --> 01:19:12,080
Yeah? And? Did you figured out?

800
01:19:14,700 --> 01:19:16,838
Raff, we had a good time. 
I really like you.

801
01:19:16,873 --> 01:19:20,200
- Then why are you doing this?
- I'm just screwed a lot of things suffering now.

802
01:19:20,201 --> 01:19:22,277
- Can we just leave it?
- No! We can't actually!

803
01:19:25,744 --> 01:19:29,100
I couldn't find the caribbean mix
so after I'll give to get you later.

804
01:19:29,101 --> 01:19:31,500
Yeah, yeah, later. I've heard that before.

805
01:19:31,605 --> 01:19:35,270
I wasn't bulling you off.
Okey, things got complicated.

806
01:19:35,271 --> 01:19:38,297
- You've started bullshitting me, Natalie!
- You wanted to know what really happened?

807
01:19:38,397 --> 01:19:41,910
I know what happened, okay? 
You let down that little yuck screwed your head!

808
01:19:43,960 --> 01:19:46,023
- Is that what do you think?
- Yes. It's obvious!

809
01:19:47,174 --> 01:19:50,600
- You've no idea what are you talking about.
- But I would known when you told me!

810
01:19:50,601 --> 01:19:51,880
- Stop it!
- What were you thinking?

811
01:19:51,881 --> 01:19:55,180
What the hell were you thinking?!
... you giving up yourself to a piece of shit?

812
01:19:55,181 --> 01:19:55,900
Stop it!

813
01:20:01,591 --> 01:20:03,840
You know I only hope good things for you.

814
01:20:04,497 --> 01:20:09,555
'Cause really bad shit happens people!
I hope the God it never happens to you!

815
01:20:34,149 --> 01:20:35,464
Welcome back, bad girl!

816
01:20:38,347 --> 01:20:42,452
Alright ladies, gentleman. 
Please leave your final reports on my desk...

817
01:20:42,487 --> 01:20:45,606
and I want to make sure your glassworhts are cleaned,
your beakers and your testcubes aren't dirty.

818
01:20:45,607 --> 01:20:49,670
If these aren't clean, you must clean them 
or you'll lose points.

819
01:20:49,672 --> 01:20:52,520
If anything is missing, please gonna sign me immediately.

820
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:57,728
Finally you make sure that your labdesks are cleaned...

821
01:21:11,252 --> 01:21:13,730
Four test cubes, three beakers...

822
01:21:16,850 --> 01:21:18,600
and a Bunsen burner.

823
01:21:21,346 --> 01:21:25,530
Yeah, okay, everything seems to be in order. Keys?

824
01:21:29,378 --> 01:21:30,506
Natalie, key?

825
01:21:35,042 --> 01:21:37,189
The end of Chemistry as we know it.

826
01:21:38,191 --> 01:21:40,730
You're such a goddamn glib little actor!

827
01:21:41,626 --> 01:21:43,840
As far as I'm concerned this is 
a really chickenshit goodbye!

828
01:21:45,140 --> 01:21:46,132
Excuse me.

829
01:21:49,285 --> 01:21:52,787
Don't worry, Walter.
She was adressing her remarks to me.

830
01:22:29,192 --> 01:22:34,900
Hey! That truck-guy's here.
Said something about going out bowling.

831
01:22:41,449 --> 01:22:44,878
- Okay.
- I've got.

832
01:23:22,289 --> 01:23:25,830
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Everybody bites it sooner or later.

833
01:23:26,637 --> 01:23:30,395
I'm just in the AP class, ahead of the game.

834
01:23:31,783 --> 01:23:35,310
- Always the joke.
- Al says it's a phase, it'll stop soon.

835
01:23:35,311 --> 01:23:38,488
But, hey! At least it wasn't all 
about the sympathy for the sick kid.

836
01:23:40,272 --> 01:23:41,423
That's not fair!

837
01:23:44,734 --> 01:23:47,831
Is Duke fair?
Is Europe fair?

838
01:23:48,466 --> 01:23:52,270
At this rate I won't even make it
to London, Ontario. Is that fair?

839
01:23:53,666 --> 01:23:54,636
Bowling.

840
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:57,794
That's what I get.

841
01:24:01,160 --> 01:24:02,222
Bowling.

842
01:24:16,617 --> 01:24:19,520
- We're not going bowling.
- Why?

843
01:24:20,259 --> 01:24:23,188
We're saving that.
Turn left!

844
01:24:53,998 --> 01:24:57,336
- So where are we going on?
- The sky's the limit.

845
01:24:57,637 --> 01:24:59,970
I've never lied in thus far.
I'm not gonna start now.

846
01:25:01,722 --> 01:25:03,250

847
01:25:03,251 --> 01:25:05,140

848
01:25:09,480 --> 01:25:12,787
What are we doing? Really?

849
01:25:13,444 --> 01:25:17,171
- This is the goodbye-scene.
- Let's not... Okay?

850
01:25:17,206 --> 01:25:19,665
Come on, Zetterstrom!
You can do it!

851
01:25:24,244 --> 01:25:27,907
Okay. Wake up Natalie!

852
01:25:28,700 --> 01:25:33,384
Don't you see what happened here?
You had a beautiful life,

853
01:25:33,985 --> 01:25:38,312
and I had shit.
I hated your guts.

854
01:25:38,451 --> 01:25:44,344
I wanted to take you down, I wanted to make you
as miserable as I am and that is exactly what I did!

855
01:25:45,214 --> 01:25:48,910
Now, how's that for a goodbye?

856
01:25:51,055 --> 01:25:55,265
- Pretty lame.
- Face it, Anderson! I screwed you.

857
01:25:57,888 --> 01:25:59,800
I screwed you big time.

858
01:26:02,313 --> 01:26:05,752
So you screwed me. So what?

859
01:26:07,404 --> 01:26:11,370
Me? I made love to you.

860
01:26:16,537 --> 01:26:19,696
Try again.
Try again!

861
01:26:37,670 --> 01:26:40,577
I had it all figured out.
So I cut out a little early, who cares?

862
01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:43,970
It's probably a good thing.
Life sucks, anyway.

863
01:26:46,275 --> 01:26:48,910
But then I met you and it got weird.

864
01:26:52,497 --> 01:26:57,669
And you were so amazing.

865
01:27:00,031 --> 01:27:03,154
- And I...
- What?

866
01:27:04,573 --> 01:27:05,730
What?

867
01:27:10,180 --> 01:27:12,543
I just wanted a little more time.

868
01:27:14,435 --> 01:27:19,510
So all in all, I'd say you're 
the worst thing that's ever happened to me.

869
01:27:21,431 --> 01:27:22,770
Goodbye partner.

870
01:27:40,205 --> 01:27:42,359
I'm staying with you until you leave.

871
01:27:42,866 --> 01:27:47,845
I don't care how much time we have!
Give up you stupid jerk?

872
01:29:06,122 --> 01:29:07,720
I'm starting it up.

873
01:29:15,125 --> 01:29:19,715
Now turn into the left till the get its place! 
Then back a little bit.

874
01:29:23,379 --> 01:29:24,233
Okay.

875
01:29:27,259 --> 01:29:30,960
Perfect. It'll good for 50,000 miles.

876
01:31:53,330 --> 01:31:56,000
