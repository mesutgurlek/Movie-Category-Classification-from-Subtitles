FILMWRITERS' AWARD

5
00:03:04,065 --> 00:03:07,397
You saw nothing in Hiroshima.
Nothing.

6
00:03:07,326 --> 00:03:09,156
I saw everything.

7
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:12,481
I saw the hospital - I'm sure of it.

8
00:03:13,688 --> 00:03:16,417
The hospital in Hiroshima exists.

9
00:03:18,003 --> 00:03:22,201
How could I not have seen it?

10
00:03:40,222 --> 00:03:43,985
You didn't see the hospital
in Hiroshima.

11
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:48,093
You saw nothing in Hiroshima.

12
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,923
Four times at the museum.

13
00:03:57,005 --> 00:03:58,938
What museum in Hiroshima?

14
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:16,148
Four times at the museum in Hiroshima.

15
00:04:16,058 --> 00:04:18,218
I saw people walking around.

16
00:04:18,231 --> 00:04:23,226
People walk around, lost in thought,
among the photographs,

17
00:04:23,154 --> 00:04:27,320
the reconstructions,
for lack of anything else.

18
00:04:27,213 --> 00:04:30,582
The photographs, the photographs,

19
00:04:30,507 --> 00:04:34,342
the reconstructions,
for lack of anything else.

20
00:04:34,472 --> 00:04:38,807
The explanations,
for lack of anything else.

21
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:44,412
Four times at the museum in Hiroshima.

22
00:04:45,596 --> 00:04:47,894
I watched the people.

23
00:04:48,346 --> 00:04:54,307
I myself, lost in thought,
looked at the scorched metal.

24
00:04:54,516 --> 00:04:56,109
The twisted metal.

25
00:04:56,114 --> 00:04:59,550
Metal made as vulnerable as flesh.

26
00:05:01,805 --> 00:05:04,273
I saw the bouquet of bottle caps.

27
00:05:04,234 --> 00:05:06,328
Who would have thought?

28
00:05:06,312 --> 00:05:09,179
Human flesh, suspended,
as if still alive,

29
00:05:09,316 --> 00:05:11,342
its agony still fresh.

30
00:05:12,355 --> 00:05:15,653
Stones. Charred stones.
Shattered stones.

31
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:18,239
Anonymous masses of hair

32
00:05:18,334 --> 00:05:22,600
that the women of Hiroshima,
upon waking in the morning,

33
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:24,352
would find had fallen out.

34
00:05:37,354 --> 00:05:40,790
I was hot in Peace Square.

35
00:05:41,351 --> 00:05:44,342
1 0, 000 degrees in Peace Square.

36
00:05:44,451 --> 00:05:46,510
I Know it.

37
00:05:47,359 --> 00:05:50,955
The temperature of the sun
in Peace Square.

38
00:05:50,941 --> 00:05:52,967
How could you not Know it?

39
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:55,050
The grass. It's quite simple.

40
00:05:55,161 --> 00:05:58,596
You saw nothing in Hiroshima.
Nothing.

41
00:06:07,053 --> 00:06:11,285
The reconstructions were
as authentic as possible.

42
00:06:12,648 --> 00:06:16,483
The films were
as authentic as possible.

43
00:06:17,347 --> 00:06:22,011
The illusion,
quite simply, is so perfect

44
00:06:21,886 --> 00:06:24,354
that tourists weep.

45
00:06:25,243 --> 00:06:27,234
One can always scoff,,

46
00:06:28,216 --> 00:06:30,651
but what else can a tourist do

47
00:06:30,614 --> 00:06:33,481
but weep?

48
00:07:09,169 --> 00:07:12,365
I've always wept over Hiroshima 's fate.

49
00:07:13,069 --> 00:07:14,467
Always.

50
00:07:14,476 --> 00:07:15,567
No.

51
00:07:15,595 --> 00:07:19,190
What was there for you to weep over?

52
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:38,859
I saw the newsreels.

53
00:07:38,963 --> 00:07:42,695
On the second day,
history tells us _ I'm not making it up _

54
00:07:43,023 --> 00:07:44,888
from the second day on,

55
00:07:44,876 --> 00:07:49,109
certain species of animals
crawled from the depths of the earth,

56
00:07:49,002 --> 00:07:51,231
and from the ashes.

57
00:07:53,316 --> 00:07:57,651
Dogs were captured on film for all time.
I saw them.

58
00:07:57,825 --> 00:08:00,816
I saw the newsreels.
I saw them.

59
00:08:00,861 --> 00:08:04,229
Of the first day, the second day,

60
00:08:04,154 --> 00:08:05,781
the third day.

61
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,075
You saw nothing.

62
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:10,819
Of the fifteenth day too.

63
00:08:11,635 --> 00:08:14,695
Hiroshima was covered in flowers.

64
00:08:15,023 --> 00:08:19,256
There were cornflowers
and gladioli everywhere,

65
00:08:19,148 --> 00:08:23,481
morning glories and day lilies

66
00:08:23,368 --> 00:08:25,665
born again from the ashes

67
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:30,665
with an extraordinary vitality
unheard of in flowers before then.

68
00:08:30,752 --> 00:08:32,947
I didn't make any of it up.

69
00:08:32,926 --> 00:08:35,895
You made it all up.

70
00:08:36,633 --> 00:08:37,965
None of it.

71
00:08:37,978 --> 00:08:41,072
just as the illusion exists in love,

72
00:08:41,236 --> 00:08:44,331
the illusion you can never forget,

73
00:08:44,275 --> 00:08:48,768
so I was under the illusion
I would never forget Hiroshima.

74
00:08:48,815 --> 00:08:51,510
just like with love.

75
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,197
I saw the survivors too,

76
00:09:01,153 --> 00:09:04,590
and those who were in the wombs
of the women of Hiroshima.

77
00:09:05,215 --> 00:09:07,546
I saw the patience,

78
00:09:07,645 --> 00:09:09,270
the innocence,

79
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:12,617
the apparent meekness

80
00:09:12,567 --> 00:09:15,661
with which the temporary survivors
of Hiroshima

81
00:09:15,604 --> 00:09:18,664
adapted to a fate so unjust

82
00:09:18,609 --> 00:09:21,908
that the imagination,
usually so fertile,

83
00:09:21,838 --> 00:09:25,366
is silent before it.

84
00:09:39,963 --> 00:09:42,262
Listen. I Know.

85
00:09:42,234 --> 00:09:44,533
I Know everything.
It went on.

86
00:09:44,505 --> 00:09:46,632
Nothing. You Know nothing.

87
00:09:47,028 --> 00:09:50,226
Women risk giving birth
to deformed children, to monsters,

88
00:09:50,513 --> 00:09:52,242
but it goes on.

89
00:09:52,335 --> 00:09:55,304
Men risk becoming sterile,

90
00:09:55,245 --> 00:09:57,213
but it goes on.

91
00:09:57,258 --> 00:10:01,593
Rain causes panic, the rain
of ash on the waters of the Pacific.

92
00:10:01,478 --> 00:10:05,973
The Pacific turns deadly,
and its fishermen die.

93
00:10:05,859 --> 00:10:07,916
Food becomes an object of fear.

94
00:10:07,905 --> 00:10:10,999
An entire city's food is thrown away.

95
00:10:10,942 --> 00:10:13,568
The food of entire cities is buried.

96
00:10:13,531 --> 00:10:15,861
An entire city rises up in anger.

97
00:10:17,015 --> 00:10:19,780
Entire cities rise up in anger.

98
00:10:20,659 --> 00:10:24,096
But against whom
do they rise up in anger?

99
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,494
The anger of entire cities,
whether they like it or not,

100
00:10:27,437 --> 00:10:29,598
against the principle
of inequality advanced

101
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:32,844
by one people against another.

102
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,331
The principle of inequality advanced

103
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:39,067
by certain races against other races.

104
00:10:39,171 --> 00:10:41,731
The principle of inequality advanced

105
00:10:41,695 --> 00:10:45,096
by certain classes against other classes.

106
00:10:46,267 --> 00:10:46,301
Listen to me.

107
00:10:46,299 --> 00:10:48,130
Listen to me.

108
00:10:48,216 --> 00:10:50,309
Like you, I Know
what it is to forget.

109
00:10:50,294 --> 00:10:53,627
No, you don't Know
what it is to forget.

110
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:58,320
Like you, I am endowed with memory.
I Know what it is to forget.

111
00:10:58,223 --> 00:11:02,320
No, you are not endowed with memory.

112
00:11:02,219 --> 00:11:06,315
Like you, I too have struggled
with all my might

113
00:11:06,854 --> 00:11:08,617
not to forget.

114
00:11:09,221 --> 00:11:11,984
Like you, I forgot.

115
00:11:15,421 --> 00:11:19,552
Like you, I longed
for a memory beyond consolation,

116
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:23,143
a memory of shadows and stone.

117
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:26,853
For my part I struggled
every day with all my might

118
00:11:27,026 --> 00:11:29,689
against the horror
of no longer understanding

119
00:11:29,713 --> 00:11:32,273
the reason to remember.

120
00:11:32,237 --> 00:11:35,695
Like you, I forgot.

121
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:46,453
Why deny the obvious necessity
of remembering?

122
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:54,056
Listen to me.
I Know something else.

123
00:11:54,008 --> 00:11:55,669
It will begin again.

124
00:11:55,671 --> 00:12:00,198
200,000 dead and 80,000 wounded
in nine seconds.

125
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:03,882
Those are the official figures.
It will begin again.

126
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:08,854
It will be 1 0, 000 degrees on the earth.
Ten thousand suns, people will say.

127
00:12:08,715 --> 00:12:11,205
The asphalt will burn.

128
00:12:11,176 --> 00:12:14,111
Chaos will prevail.

129
00:12:14,052 --> 00:12:16,885
An entire city will be lifted
off the ground,

130
00:12:16,835 --> 00:12:19,030
then fall back to earth in ashes.

131
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:26,887
New vegetation rises
from the sands.

132
00:12:27,895 --> 00:12:31,059
Four students await together,
like brothers,

133
00:12:30,995 --> 00:12:33,862
a legendary death.

134
00:12:39,307 --> 00:12:42,299
The seven branches of the delta estuary

135
00:12:42,249 --> 00:12:44,182
of the river Ota

136
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:48,570
drain and fill at their usual hour,

137
00:12:48,835 --> 00:12:52,703
precisely at their usual hour,

138
00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:56,440
with fresh water rich with fish,
grey or blue,

139
00:12:56,348 --> 00:12:58,473
depending on the season
and time of day.

140
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:03,038
People along the muddy banks
no longer watch

141
00:13:03,476 --> 00:13:05,875
the tide slowly rise

142
00:13:05,843 --> 00:13:10,973
in the seven branches
of the delta estuary of the river Ota.

143
00:13:23,744 --> 00:13:27,578
I meet you.
I remember you.

144
00:13:28,156 --> 00:13:29,885
Who are you?

145
00:13:29,882 --> 00:13:33,182
You're destroying me.
You're good for me.

146
00:13:33,526 --> 00:13:37,327
How could I Know this city
was tailor-made for love?

147
00:13:38,033 --> 00:13:42,403
How could I Know
you fit my body like a glove?

148
00:13:43,117 --> 00:13:44,583
I like you.

149
00:13:44,588 --> 00:13:46,487
How unlikely.

150
00:13:46,601 --> 00:13:48,536
I like you.

151
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,205
How slow all of a sudden.

152
00:13:51,685 --> 00:13:53,710
How sweet.

153
00:13:53,955 --> 00:13:56,117
You cannot Know.

154
00:13:56,638 --> 00:14:00,336
You're destroying me.
You're good for me.

155
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:09,328
You're destroying me.
You're good for me.

156
00:14:10,706 --> 00:14:12,401
I have time.

157
00:14:12,495 --> 00:14:15,987
Please, devour me.

158
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:19,861
Deform me
to the point of ugliness.

159
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,181
Why not you?

160
00:14:22,758 --> 00:14:27,752
Why not you in this city
and in this night

161
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:30,677
so like other cities and other nights
you can hardly tell the difference?

162
00:14:31,325 --> 00:14:33,317
I beg of you.

163
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:38,010
You have such beautiful ski n.

164
00:14:41,586 --> 00:14:43,054
You!

165
00:14:43,731 --> 00:14:46,723
Yes. me. Surprised?.

166
00:15:01,953 --> 00:15:06,947
Are you completely Japanese or not?.

167
00:15:07,099 --> 00:15:09,294
Completely. I am Japanese.

168
00:15:11,031 --> 00:15:13,828
Your eyes are green. aren't they?.

169
00:15:14,354 --> 00:15:17,153
Yes. I think they're green.

170
00:15:17,232 --> 00:15:19,827
You're like a thousand women in one.

171
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:23,252
That's because you don't know me.

172
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:25,940
That might not be the only reason.

173
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:31,552
I don't mind being
a thousand women in one for you.

174
00:15:33,888 --> 00:15:35,719
Listen.

175
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:37,598
It's 4:.00.

176
00:15:37,948 --> 00:15:39,677
Why?.

177
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:41,671
I don't know who it is.

178
00:15:41,784 --> 00:15:44,981
Every day he passes by at 4:.00
and coughs.

179
00:15:58,568 --> 00:16:01,093
Were you here in Hiroshima?.

180
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:04,010
Of course not.

181
00:16:04,835 --> 00:16:07,700
That's right.
How foolish of me.

182
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:13,375
But my family was in Hiroshima.

183
00:16:14,935 --> 00:16:17,666
I was off fighting the war.

184
00:16:18,101 --> 00:16:20,593
Lucky for you. eh?.

185
00:16:22,096 --> 00:16:23,690
Yes.

186
00:16:24,176 --> 00:16:26,440
Lucky for me too.

187
00:16:33,606 --> 00:16:36,166
Why are you in Hiroshima?.

188
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:37,552
A film.

189
00:16:37,568 --> 00:16:39,229
A film?.

190
00:16:39,231 --> 00:16:41,632
I'm acting in a film.

191
00:16:44,026 --> 00:16:47,155
Where were you
before you came to Hiroshima?.

192
00:16:48,565 --> 00:16:50,466
Paris.

193
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:52,974
And before Paris?.

194
00:16:53,043 --> 00:16:55,943
Before Paris I was in Nevers.

195
00:17:01,226 --> 00:17:03,593
It's in the province of Nièvre.
You don't know it.

196
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:13,155
Why did you want to see
everything in Hiroshima?.

197
00:17:14,749 --> 00:17:16,875
It interested me.

198
00:17:17,178 --> 00:17:19,203
I have my own idea about it.

199
00:17:19,735 --> 00:17:23,036
For example. Looking closely
at things is something

200
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:25,519
that has to be learned.

201
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:25,890
that has to be learned.

202
00:18:35,053 --> 00:18:36,784
Would you like some coffee?.

203
00:18:49,057 --> 00:18:50,886
What were you dreaming about?.

204
00:18:50,973 --> 00:18:52,942
I don't remember. Why?.

205
00:18:54,107 --> 00:18:55,869
I was watching your hands.

206
00:18:55,962 --> 00:18:58,020
They move when you're sleep.

207
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:06,423
Maybe that happens
when you don't realize you're dreaming.

208
00:19:27,161 --> 00:19:29,823
You're a beautiful woman.
You know that?.

209
00:19:29,784 --> 00:19:31,614
- You think so?.
- I think so.

210
00:19:31,765 --> 00:19:34,131
A bit worn out. no?.

211
00:19:35,827 --> 00:19:38,454
- A bit ugly.
- You don't mind?.

212
00:19:38,447 --> 00:19:40,916
That's what I noticed
last night at the café.

213
00:19:40,878 --> 00:19:43,437
How ugly you were and--

214
00:19:43,404 --> 00:19:46,166
- And?.
- And how bored you looked.

215
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,675
Tell me more.

216
00:19:47,782 --> 00:19:52,015
You were bored in a way
that makes a man want to know a woman.

217
00:19:57,308 --> 00:19:59,276
You speak French well.

218
00:19:59,675 --> 00:20:01,005
Don't I though!

219
00:20:01,081 --> 00:20:04,482
I'm glad you finally noticed.

220
00:20:06,068 --> 00:20:10,027
I hadn't noticed
that you don't speak Japanese.

221
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:17,751
Have you ever noticed people have
a way of noticing what they want?.

222
00:20:19,655 --> 00:20:22,782
I noticed you. That's all.

223
00:20:36,438 --> 00:20:41,501
To meet in Hiroshima.

224
00:20:43,057 --> 00:20:45,025
That doesn't happen everyday.

225
00:20:45,295 --> 00:20:49,390
What did Hiroshima
mean to you in France?.

226
00:20:52,199 --> 00:20:54,134
The end of the war.

227
00:20:54,724 --> 00:20:56,885
I mean completely.

228
00:20:57,666 --> 00:21:00,134
Astonishment that they dared do it.

229
00:21:00,094 --> 00:21:02,461
and astonishment
that they succeeded.

230
00:21:03,739 --> 00:21:06,868
And the beginning
of an unknown fear for us as well.

231
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:10,740
And then indifference.

232
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:13,593
And fear of indifference as well.

233
00:21:13,714 --> 00:21:15,546
Where were you?.

234
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:19,015
I had just left Nevers.

235
00:21:19,115 --> 00:21:20,947
I was in Paris. In the street.

236
00:21:22,089 --> 00:21:25,890
That's a beautiful French word: Nevers.

237
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:31,089
A word like any other.
Just like the town.

238
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:42,859
Have you met many Japanese
in Hiroshima?.

239
00:21:43,828 --> 00:21:45,693
A few.

240
00:21:46,098 --> 00:21:48,034
but none like you.

241
00:21:48,495 --> 00:21:51,363
Am I the first Japanese in your life?.

242
00:21:51,311 --> 00:21:52,833
Yes.

243
00:21:53,546 --> 00:21:55,378
Hiroshima.

244
00:21:55,625 --> 00:21:58,923
The whole world rejoiced.

245
00:21:58,982 --> 00:22:02,509
and you rejoiced with it.

246
00:22:04,095 --> 00:22:08,260
Was it a beautiful summer day in Paris?.

247
00:22:08,923 --> 00:22:11,391
I heard it was. Wasn't it?.

248
00:22:11,609 --> 00:22:13,578
Yes. it was a nice day.

249
00:22:14,135 --> 00:22:17,468
- How old were you?.
- Twenty. You?.

250
00:22:17,812 --> 00:22:20,803
- Twenty-two.
- The same age. really.

251
00:22:21,328 --> 00:22:22,920
Just about.

252
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,593
What do you do for work?.

253
00:22:32,515 --> 00:22:34,609
I'm an architect.

254
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:38,756
And I'm also...

255
00:22:39,774 --> 00:22:41,639
in politics.

256
00:22:41,884 --> 00:22:44,182
Is that why you speak French so well?.

257
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:48,412
That's why.
To read about the French Revolution.

258
00:22:53,488 --> 00:22:56,218
What is this film you're in?.

259
00:22:56,461 --> 00:22:58,258
It's a film about peace.

260
00:22:58,348 --> 00:23:01,613
What else would you expect
in Hiroshima?.

261
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:20,087
I'd like to see you again.

262
00:23:23,442 --> 00:23:25,932
At this time tomorrow

263
00:23:26,895 --> 00:23:28,885
I'll be on my way back to France.

264
00:23:28,973 --> 00:23:31,442
Really?. You didn't tell me.

265
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:34,958
It's true.

266
00:23:35,047 --> 00:23:37,312
There was no point in telling you.

267
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:41,421
That's why you let me
come up to your room last night.

268
00:23:41,376 --> 00:23:44,711
Because it was your last day
in Hiroshima.

269
00:23:46,171 --> 00:23:49,402
Not at all.
The thought never crossed my mind.

270
00:23:49,401 --> 00:23:53,996
When you speak. I wonder
whether you lie or tell the truth.

271
00:23:54,677 --> 00:23:57,703
I lie... and I tell the truth.

272
00:23:58,192 --> 00:24:01,060
But I have no reason to lie to you.

273
00:24:01,516 --> 00:24:06,079
Tell me. do things like this
happen to you often?.

274
00:24:07,047 --> 00:24:08,879
Not all that often.

275
00:24:08,933 --> 00:24:11,129
But they happen.

276
00:24:12,418 --> 00:24:14,886
I'm very fond of men.

277
00:24:17,277 --> 00:24:20,008
I have dubious morals. you know.

278
00:24:20,474 --> 00:24:24,001
What do you call
having "dubious morals"?.

279
00:24:24,438 --> 00:24:27,032
Being dubious
about other people's morals.

280
00:24:34,412 --> 00:24:36,904
I'd like to see you again.

281
00:24:37,035 --> 00:24:41,198
Even if your plane leaves tomorrow morning.
Even if you have dubious morals.

282
00:24:43,939 --> 00:24:45,498
Why?.

283
00:24:46,465 --> 00:24:47,932
Because.

284
00:25:01,714 --> 00:25:03,649
You don't want
to talk to me anymore?.

285
00:25:07,308 --> 00:25:09,675
I'd like to see you again.

286
00:25:18,688 --> 00:25:20,987
Where are you going in France?.
Nevers?.

287
00:25:20,959 --> 00:25:24,360
No. Paris.
I'm never going back to Nevers.

288
00:25:24,604 --> 00:25:26,662
- Never?.
- Never.

289
00:25:28,344 --> 00:25:31,313
I was never younger
than I was in Nevers.

290
00:25:31,925 --> 00:25:33,916
Young in Nevers.

291
00:25:35,185 --> 00:25:37,277
Young in Nevers.

292
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:41,765
And mad in Nevers too.

293
00:25:56,412 --> 00:26:00,509
You see. Nevers
is the one city in the world _

294
00:26:00,921 --> 00:26:04,357
the one thing in the world _
I dream of most at night

295
00:26:05,267 --> 00:26:09,636
and at the same time
think about the least.

296
00:26:10,607 --> 00:26:13,041
What was this madness
of yours in Nevers like?.

297
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:18,182
Madness is like intelligence.

298
00:26:18,598 --> 00:26:22,328
You can't explain it.
Just like intelligence.

299
00:26:22,276 --> 00:26:25,802
It comes over you. consumes you.

300
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:28,034
and then you understand.

301
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:30,931
But when it's gone.
you no longer understand it at all.

302
00:26:31,003 --> 00:26:32,970
Were you full of hate?.

303
00:26:32,953 --> 00:26:34,784
That was my madness.

304
00:26:34,807 --> 00:26:37,139
I was mad with hate.

305
00:26:37,619 --> 00:26:41,954
I felt I could make a career of hating.

306
00:26:41,936 --> 00:26:44,666
All I cared about was hating.

307
00:26:44,781 --> 00:26:46,907
Do you understand?.
- Yes.

308
00:26:49,064 --> 00:26:52,432
It's true. I guess you must
understand that too.

309
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:55,144
Did it ever happen to you again?.

310
00:26:57,567 --> 00:26:59,160
It's over.

311
00:26:59,166 --> 00:27:00,930
During the war?.

312
00:27:00,925 --> 00:27:02,516
Right after it.

313
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:07,741
Was that one of the hardships
of life in France after the war?.

314
00:27:08,021 --> 00:27:10,650
You could say that.

315
00:27:10,739 --> 00:27:13,833
When did this madness of yours pass?.

316
00:27:14,095 --> 00:27:17,428
It went away little by little.
and then when I had children. of course.

317
00:27:17,357 --> 00:27:18,984
What did you say?.

318
00:27:19,052 --> 00:27:23,046
I said it went away little by little.
and then when I had children. of course.

319
00:27:27,203 --> 00:27:31,866
I'd like to spend a few days with you
somewhere sometime.

320
00:27:33,629 --> 00:27:34,959
Me too.

321
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:37,633
To see you again today
wouldn't really be "seeing you again."

322
00:27:37,593 --> 00:27:41,154
Such a short time doesn't count.
I really would like to.

323
00:27:50,029 --> 00:27:51,519
Very well.

324
00:27:54,823 --> 00:27:57,348
It's because
you know I'm leaving tomorrow.

325
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:59,974
That may be part of it.

326
00:27:59,939 --> 00:28:02,465
But it's as good a reason
as any. isn't it?.

327
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:09,140
The thought of never seeing you again
in just a few hours _

328
00:28:53,743 --> 00:28:57,270
You were easy to find in Hiroshima.

329
00:29:04,612 --> 00:29:07,274
Is it a French film?.

330
00:29:07,616 --> 00:29:11,212
No. International.
It's about peace.

331
00:29:11,292 --> 00:29:14,285
- Is it finished?.
- It is for me.

332
00:29:14,553 --> 00:29:16,453
There are some crowd scenes
left to shoot.

333
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:22,124
There are lots of commercials
for soap.

334
00:29:22,067 --> 00:29:24,593
Maybe by pressing the point _

335
00:29:24,593 --> 00:29:26,322
Yes. maybe.

336
00:29:26,446 --> 00:29:30,313
Here in Hiroshima we don't
make fun of films about peace.

337
00:29:44,187 --> 00:29:46,020
Are you tired?.

338
00:29:51,413 --> 00:29:53,279
No more than you.

339
00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:57,467
I've been thinking
about Nevers in France.

340
00:29:58,766 --> 00:30:00,759
I've been thinking about you.

341
00:30:02,666 --> 00:30:04,759
Is your flight still tomorrow?.

342
00:30:04,744 --> 00:30:07,077
- Yes.
- Without fail?.

343
00:30:07,047 --> 00:30:10,107
Yes. The picture is behind schedule.

344
00:30:10,211 --> 00:30:12,702
I was supposed to be in Paris
a month ago.

345
00:30:36,362 --> 00:30:41,197
You give me
a tremendous desire to love.

346
00:30:43,427 --> 00:30:45,417
Always.

347
00:30:45,791 --> 00:30:48,124
Short-lived affairs.

348
00:30:50,171 --> 00:30:52,003
Me too.

349
00:30:59,603 --> 00:31:02,866
It's not always this strong.
and you know it.

350
00:31:11,494 --> 00:31:15,692
They say there's a storm coming
before nightfall.

351
00:31:24,729 --> 00:31:28,963
I F ONE A-BOMB EQUALS
20.000 ORDI NARY BOMBS.

352
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:39,308
AND AN H-BOMB EQUALS
1.500 ATOMIC BOMBS.

353
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:49,723
HOW MUCH DOTHE 40.000
A-BOMBS AND H-BOMBS

354
00:31:49,761 --> 00:31:53,026
CURRENTLY STOCKPILED
IN THEWORLD EQUAL?.

355
00:31:52,958 --> 00:31:57,724
THEY AREATRIBUTE
TO MAN'S SCIENTIFIC GENIUS.

356
00:31:58,202 --> 00:32:00,692
BUT UNFORTUNATELY
MAN'S POLITICAL INTELLIGENCE

357
00:32:00,662 --> 00:32:03,723
IS 1 00TIMES LESS DEVELOPED
THAN HIS SCIENTIFIC INTELLIGENCE.

358
00:32:06,322 --> 00:32:09,256
AND FORTHAT REASON
HE FORFEITS OUR RESPECT.

359
00:32:09,198 --> 00:32:11,689
STOPTHERMONUCLEARTESTING!

360
00:32:42,157 --> 00:32:45,093
I don't like to think
about you leaving tomorrow.

361
00:33:19,338 --> 00:33:21,829
I think I love you.

362
00:33:57,251 --> 00:34:00,619
You will come with me once more.

363
00:34:12,822 --> 00:34:14,812
Answer me.

364
00:34:16,019 --> 00:34:17,951
Are you afraid?.

365
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:29,935
Sit down.

366
00:35:33,222 --> 00:35:35,589
Are you all alone in Hiroshima?.

367
00:35:35,939 --> 00:35:37,964
Where is your wife?.

368
00:35:38,336 --> 00:35:42,272
She's in Unzen. in the mountains.
I'm alone.

369
00:35:43,132 --> 00:35:45,225
When is she coming back?.

370
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:47,168
In a few days.

371
00:35:58,254 --> 00:36:00,585
What is your wife like?.

372
00:36:01,513 --> 00:36:03,344
Beautiful.

373
00:36:03,561 --> 00:36:06,928
I'm a man
who's happy with his wife.

374
00:36:08,675 --> 00:36:10,371
So am I.

375
00:36:10,816 --> 00:36:13,376
I'm a woman
who's happy with her husband.

376
00:36:14,558 --> 00:36:16,583
It would have been too easy.

377
00:36:18,874 --> 00:36:21,898
- Don't you work in the afternoon?.
- Yes. a lot.

378
00:36:21,974 --> 00:36:24,441
Mostly in the afternoon.

379
00:36:30,158 --> 00:36:32,319
This whole thing is ridiculous.

380
00:37:02,126 --> 00:37:04,617
Are you giving up your afternoon
because of me?.

381
00:37:06,091 --> 00:37:08,354
Tell me.
What difference can it make?.

382
00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:20,727
The man you loved during the war _
was he French?.

383
00:37:28,532 --> 00:37:30,558
He wasn't French.

384
00:37:39,818 --> 00:37:41,512
Yes.

385
00:37:42,407 --> 00:37:44,705
It was in Nevers.

386
00:38:38,639 --> 00:38:41,733
At first we met in barns.

387
00:38:43,947 --> 00:38:46,470
Then among the ruins.

388
00:38:48,902 --> 00:38:51,370
Then in rooms.

389
00:38:51,363 --> 00:38:53,262
Like anywhere else.

390
00:39:12,144 --> 00:39:14,008
Then he died.

391
00:39:21,414 --> 00:39:23,610
I was 1 8.

392
00:39:23,716 --> 00:39:25,979
He was 23.

393
00:40:05,339 --> 00:40:09,332
Why speak of him and not others?.

394
00:40:09,239 --> 00:40:11,208
- Why not?.
- No! Why?.

395
00:40:12,531 --> 00:40:14,966
Because of Nevers.

396
00:40:15,666 --> 00:40:18,791
I'm only just beginning
to know you.

397
00:40:19,246 --> 00:40:23,875
and from the many thousands
of things in your life.

398
00:40:23,752 --> 00:40:25,720
I choose Nevers.

399
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:27,823
Just like that?.

400
00:40:28,197 --> 00:40:30,824
- Yes.
- No. it wasn't by chance.

401
00:40:30,785 --> 00:40:33,152
You have to tell me why.

402
00:40:34,367 --> 00:40:38,770
I somehow understand
that it was there

403
00:40:39,099 --> 00:40:42,966
that you were so young

404
00:40:43,478 --> 00:40:46,604
that you didn't yet belong
to anyone in particular.

405
00:40:46,545 --> 00:40:48,707
and I like that.

406
00:40:48,912 --> 00:40:50,970
No. that's not it.

407
00:40:54,443 --> 00:40:57,810
I somehow understand
that it was there

408
00:40:57,832 --> 00:41:00,926
that I almost lost you

409
00:41:00,868 --> 00:41:05,532
and ran the risk
of never. ever meeting you.

410
00:41:06,176 --> 00:41:09,575
I somehow understand
that it was there

411
00:41:09,628 --> 00:41:15,327
that you began to be
who you are today.

412
00:41:42,812 --> 00:41:45,302
I want to leave this place!

413
00:41:50,068 --> 00:41:53,060
There's nothing left for us to do now

414
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:57,138
but kill the hours until your departure.

415
00:41:57,422 --> 00:42:00,447
Sixteen hours until your flight.

416
00:42:02,472 --> 00:42:04,497
It's too much!

417
00:42:05,699 --> 00:42:07,760
You mustn't be afraid.

418
00:42:48,761 --> 00:42:54,291
Does "Nevers" have
any other meaning in French?.

419
00:42:55,349 --> 00:42:57,145
No.

420
00:42:57,584 --> 00:43:02,318
Would you have been cold
in that cellar in Nevers

421
00:43:02,188 --> 00:43:04,454
if we had loved each other?.

422
00:43:04,649 --> 00:43:07,050
I would have been cold.

423
00:43:07,752 --> 00:43:11,552
The cellars in Nevers are cold
both summer and winter.

424
00:43:12,898 --> 00:43:16,529
The city slopes down to a river
called the Loire.

425
00:43:17,311 --> 00:43:19,939
I can't picture Nevers.

426
00:43:19,964 --> 00:43:23,399
Nevers. Population 40,000.

427
00:43:23,673 --> 00:43:26,106
Built like a capital.

428
00:43:26,293 --> 00:43:28,956
A child can walk
all the way around it.

429
00:43:29,011 --> 00:43:31,035
I was born in Nevers.

430
00:43:36,779 --> 00:43:39,009
I grew up in Nevers.

431
00:43:41,669 --> 00:43:44,263
I learned to read in Nevers.

432
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:52,313
That's where I turned 2 0.

433
00:43:57,877 --> 00:43:59,937
And the Loire?.

434
00:44:02,131 --> 00:44:05,100
It's a completely unnavigable river.

435
00:44:05,199 --> 00:44:07,224
It's always empty

436
00:44:07,757 --> 00:44:11,659
due to its irregular course
and sand bars.

437
00:44:14,599 --> 00:44:17,657
In France it's considered
a very beautiful river.

438
00:44:19,298 --> 00:44:22,698
due mostly to its light.

439
00:44:24,795 --> 00:44:27,491
So very soft.

440
00:44:27,864 --> 00:44:30,264
If you only knew.

441
00:44:36,945 --> 00:44:40,242
When you're in the cellar. am I dead?.

442
00:44:40,555 --> 00:44:42,217
You're dead.

443
00:44:47,270 --> 00:44:49,260
How can anyone endure such pain?.

444
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:55,343
The cellar is small.

445
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:58,383
Very small.

446
00:44:59,992 --> 00:45:02,757
The Marseillaise passes
above my head.

447
00:45:03,894 --> 00:45:05,450
It's deafening!

448
00:45:12,108 --> 00:45:15,101
Hands become useless in a cellar.

449
00:45:16,841 --> 00:45:20,503
They claw
and scrape away at the rocks

450
00:45:21,412 --> 00:45:23,470
until they bleed.

451
00:45:25,982 --> 00:45:29,782
It's all you can think of
to help yourself

452
00:45:30,074 --> 00:45:32,804
and to remember.

453
00:45:34,742 --> 00:45:38,270
I loved blood since I had tasted yours.

454
00:45:54,595 --> 00:45:57,656
The world passes by above my head.

455
00:45:58,113 --> 00:46:01,446
in place of the sky. of course.

456
00:46:02,459 --> 00:46:05,292
I watch that world pass by.

457
00:46:05,625 --> 00:46:08,752
Hurriedly during the week.

458
00:46:09,108 --> 00:46:12,010
Leisurely on Sundays.

459
00:46:13,681 --> 00:46:16,550
It doesn't Know I'm in the cellar.

460
00:46:17,069 --> 00:46:19,629
They pretend I'm dead.

461
00:46:19,594 --> 00:46:22,324
Dead. far from Nevers.

462
00:46:26,341 --> 00:46:30,142
My father prefers it that way,
since I was disgraced.

463
00:46:30,530 --> 00:46:32,928
My father prefers...

464
00:46:34,587 --> 00:46:36,316
Do you scream?.

465
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:39,354
Not in the beginning.

466
00:46:39,353 --> 00:46:41,251
I call your name softly.

467
00:46:41,239 --> 00:46:44,035
- But I'm dead.
- I call your name anyway.

468
00:46:43,987 --> 00:46:45,852
Even if you're dead.

469
00:46:45,842 --> 00:46:48,810
Then one day, I suddenly scream.

470
00:46:48,750 --> 00:46:51,777
Loud, like a deaf person.

471
00:46:52,649 --> 00:46:54,742
That's when they put me in the cellar.

472
00:46:54,729 --> 00:46:56,697
To punish me.

473
00:46:56,840 --> 00:47:01,333
- What did you scream?
- Your German name. Just your name.

474
00:47:02,272 --> 00:47:06,733
The only memory I have left
is your name.

475
00:47:09,883 --> 00:47:12,679
I promise I won't scream anymore,

476
00:47:12,728 --> 00:47:15,752
so they take me back up to my room.

477
00:47:18,290 --> 00:47:22,488
I yearn for you so badly
I can't bear it anymore.

478
00:47:23,309 --> 00:47:25,572
-Are you afraid?
- I'm afraid everywhere.

479
00:47:25,547 --> 00:47:27,514
In the cellar. In my room.

480
00:47:31,044 --> 00:47:34,980
- Of what?.
- Of never seeing you again.

481
00:47:36,063 --> 00:47:37,964
Ever.

482
00:47:41,754 --> 00:47:45,417
I turn 2 0 one day in the cellar.

483
00:47:46,551 --> 00:47:49,347
My mother comes
and tells me I'm 20 years old.

484
00:47:50,961 --> 00:47:53,087
My mother's crying.

485
00:47:53,071 --> 00:47:55,631
Do you spit in your mother's face?.

486
00:47:57,068 --> 00:47:57,896
Yes.

487
00:48:04,101 --> 00:48:05,966
Drink.

488
00:48:13,275 --> 00:48:15,572
Afterwards. I don't remember anymore.

489
00:48:17,655 --> 00:48:19,850
I don't remember anymore.

490
00:48:21,332 --> 00:48:28,066
You were saying the cellars
in Nevers are old and damp?.

491
00:48:28,908 --> 00:48:32,538
Yes, full of salt peter.

492
00:48:35,974 --> 00:48:38,875
Sometimes a cat comes in
to have a look around.

493
00:48:39,137 --> 00:48:41,163
It doesn't bother me.

494
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:45,372
I don't remember anymore.

495
00:48:45,626 --> 00:48:47,720
Afterwards. I don't remember anymore.

496
00:48:48,090 --> 00:48:50,250
How long?.

497
00:48:51,415 --> 00:48:53,475
An eternity.

498
00:49:44,290 --> 00:49:47,259
I was so young once!

499
00:49:58,419 --> 00:50:01,513
At night my mother
takes me into the garden.

500
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:05,641
She looks at my head.

501
00:50:06,125 --> 00:50:09,822
Every night she looks
carefully at my head.

502
00:50:11,495 --> 00:50:14,760
She still doesn't dare come close.

503
00:50:16,164 --> 00:50:19,258
At night I can see the town square.

504
00:50:19,678 --> 00:50:22,169
So I look.

505
00:50:23,101 --> 00:50:25,330
It's huge.

506
00:50:27,127 --> 00:50:29,687
It curves in the middle.

507
00:50:31,252 --> 00:50:34,221
Sleep comes only at dawn.

508
00:50:36,048 --> 00:50:38,881
Does it ever rain?.

509
00:50:40,716 --> 00:50:43,114
Along the walls.

510
00:50:48,131 --> 00:50:50,395
I think of you.

511
00:50:51,233 --> 00:50:53,600
but I no longer speak of it.

512
00:50:53,854 --> 00:50:55,754
Madwoman!

513
00:50:58,552 --> 00:51:01,885
Madly in love with you.

514
00:51:06,065 --> 00:51:08,626
My hair grows back.

515
00:51:09,262 --> 00:51:12,754
I can feel it with my hands. day by day.

516
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:15,042
I don't care.

517
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:18,427
But still, it's growing back.

518
00:51:21,475 --> 00:51:24,239
Do you scream
before going down to the cellar?.

519
00:51:24,990 --> 00:51:27,687
No. I feel nothing.

520
00:51:27,741 --> 00:51:29,231
They're young.

521
00:51:29,947 --> 00:51:32,677
They shave my head carefully
till they finish the job.

522
00:51:32,823 --> 00:51:35,690
They believe it's their duty.

523
00:51:35,766 --> 00:51:38,427
Are you ashamed for them, my love?

524
00:51:40,624 --> 00:51:42,319
You are dead.

525
00:51:42,637 --> 00:51:45,697
I'm too busy suffering.

526
00:51:46,729 --> 00:51:49,495
Night falls.

527
00:51:50,727 --> 00:51:54,663
I hear nothing but the sound
of the scissors on my head.

528
00:51:55,841 --> 00:52:02,007
I t eases the pain
of your death a bit. Like _

529
00:52:02,585 --> 00:52:06,614
I don't know how else to say it _

530
00:52:06,645 --> 00:52:11,480
Like for my nails... the walls... my anger.

531
00:52:14,190 --> 00:52:16,625
What pain!

532
00:52:16,654 --> 00:52:18,950
What pain in my heart!

533
00:52:22,184 --> 00:52:24,980
They sing the Marseillaise
all through the town.

534
00:52:26,275 --> 00:52:28,266
Night falls.

535
00:52:28,353 --> 00:52:30,947
My dead lover is an enemy of France.

536
00:52:32,510 --> 00:52:35,741
Someone says she should be
paraded through town.

537
00:52:36,537 --> 00:52:40,597
My father's pharmacy is closed
due to the disgrace.

538
00:52:41,875 --> 00:52:44,311
I am alone.

539
00:52:44,850 --> 00:52:47,249
Some of them are laughing.

540
00:52:48,876 --> 00:52:51,506
I return home at night.

541
00:53:08,377 --> 00:53:13,248
And then one day. my love.
your eternity comes to an end.

542
00:53:21,038 --> 00:53:22,594
Yes.

543
00:53:24,521 --> 00:53:29,051
A long time.
They said it was a long time.

544
00:53:31,395 --> 00:53:37,094
The cathedral bells ring at 6:00
every evening, summer and winter.

545
00:53:37,596 --> 00:53:40,964
One day I hear them.

546
00:53:41,208 --> 00:53:44,645
I remember having heard them before.

547
00:53:44,662 --> 00:53:47,687
Before, when we were in love,

548
00:53:47,635 --> 00:53:50,196
when we were happy.

549
00:53:51,566 --> 00:53:53,558
I begin to see.

550
00:53:53,933 --> 00:53:57,300
I remember having seen before,

551
00:53:57,227 --> 00:53:59,956
when we were in love,

552
00:53:59,975 --> 00:54:02,467
when we were happy.

553
00:54:03,620 --> 00:54:05,645
I remember.

554
00:54:05,792 --> 00:54:07,852
I see the ink.

555
00:54:07,839 --> 00:54:10,136
I see the daylight.

556
00:54:10,621 --> 00:54:14,079
I see my life. Your death.

557
00:54:14,201 --> 00:54:17,795
My life that goes on,
your death that goes on.

558
00:54:18,422 --> 00:54:23,654
I see that the shadows take longer
to reach the corners of the room

559
00:54:25,071 --> 00:54:30,667
and the corners of the cellar.

560
00:54:31,751 --> 00:54:34,083
About half past six.

561
00:54:37,825 --> 00:54:40,260
Winter has ended.

562
00:54:49,112 --> 00:54:51,010
It's horrible!

563
00:54:51,125 --> 00:54:53,889
I remember you
less and less clearly.

564
00:54:55,791 --> 00:54:58,056
Give me something to drink.

565
00:55:06,406 --> 00:55:09,033
I begin to forget you.

566
00:55:10,625 --> 00:55:13,789
I tremble at forgetting such love.

567
00:55:15,324 --> 00:55:17,226
More.

568
00:55:33,066 --> 00:55:37,595
We were to meet at noon
on the banks of the Loire.

569
00:55:38,790 --> 00:55:41,623
I was to leave with him.

570
00:55:42,756 --> 00:55:45,589
When I arrived at noon
on the banks of the Loire,

571
00:55:46,878 --> 00:55:48,812
he wasn't quite dead yet.

572
00:55:49,084 --> 00:55:51,985
Someone had fired on him
from a garden.

573
00:55:53,559 --> 00:55:58,929
I stayed by his body all that day

574
00:56:00,336 --> 00:56:03,500
and all the following night.

575
00:56:06,667 --> 00:56:11,832
The next morning. they came
to get him and put him in a truck.

576
00:56:13,315 --> 00:56:16,683
Nevers was liberated that night.

577
00:56:19,837 --> 00:56:25,469
The cathedral bells rang and rang.

578
00:56:28,148 --> 00:56:31,709
He grew cold beneath me.
Little by little.

579
00:56:34,864 --> 00:56:37,924
He took so long to die!

580
00:56:39,531 --> 00:56:41,590
When?.

581
00:56:41,769 --> 00:56:44,237
I don't know exactly.

582
00:56:44,804 --> 00:56:47,773
I was lying on top of him.

583
00:56:51,358 --> 00:56:54,759
The moment of his death
actually escaped me.

584
00:56:57,529 --> 00:57:02,331
because at that moment
and even afterwards --

585
00:57:03,635 --> 00:57:06,195
yes. I can even say afterwards _

586
00:57:06,641 --> 00:57:10,132
I couldn't find
the slightest difference

587
00:57:10,062 --> 00:57:12,529
between his dead body and my own.

588
00:57:15,782 --> 00:57:19,013
His body and mine

589
00:57:20,033 --> 00:57:22,969
seemed to me to be
one and the same.

590
00:57:23,709 --> 00:57:27,645
You understand?.
He was my first love!

591
00:57:45,129 --> 00:57:47,962
Then one day I screamed again.

592
00:57:48,262 --> 00:57:50,822
so they put me back in the cellar.

593
00:58:03,895 --> 00:58:06,193
It was warm.

594
00:58:10,449 --> 00:58:14,250
I think it was then
that my hatred left me.

595
00:58:16,172 --> 00:58:18,435
I don't scream anymore.

596
00:58:18,666 --> 00:58:21,361
I become reasonable.

597
00:58:22,020 --> 00:58:25,958
They say. "She's become reasonable."

598
00:58:28,479 --> 00:58:31,504
One holiday evening

599
00:58:32,314 --> 00:58:34,374
they let me out.

600
00:58:35,033 --> 00:58:38,298
The banks of the Loire at dawn.

601
00:58:39,188 --> 00:58:41,281
People cross the bridge,

602
00:58:41,363 --> 00:58:43,854
in greater or smaller numbers,
depending on the hour.

603
00:58:43,823 --> 00:58:45,689
From afar they're nobody.

604
00:58:46,670 --> 00:58:48,864
It isn't long after that

605
00:58:48,843 --> 00:58:53,337
that my mother tells me I must
leave for Paris during the night.

606
00:58:53,989 --> 00:58:56,051
She gives me some money.

607
00:58:57,730 --> 00:59:01,360
I take off for Paris
one night on a bicycle.

608
00:59:02,559 --> 00:59:05,653
It's summer, and the nights are warm.

609
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:19,840
When I get to Paris two days later,

610
00:59:19,948 --> 00:59:23,351
Hiroshima is in all the papers.

611
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:27,833
My hair has grown back
to a decent length.

612
00:59:27,909 --> 00:59:30,742
I'm among the crowds in the street.

613
00:59:35,166 --> 00:59:38,157
Fourteen years have passed.

614
01:00:08,478 --> 01:00:11,469
I don't even remember
his hands very well.

615
01:00:12,792 --> 01:00:15,456
I still remember the pain a little bit.

616
01:00:15,541 --> 01:00:17,406
Tonight?.

617
01:00:17,750 --> 01:00:20,343
Yes. I remember it tonight.

618
01:00:21,681 --> 01:00:24,513
But one day
I will no longer remember it.

619
01:00:24,686 --> 01:00:26,654
At all.

620
01:00:27,435 --> 01:00:29,629
Nothing.

621
01:00:32,197 --> 01:00:36,031
Tomorrow at this time

622
01:00:36,610 --> 01:00:40,170
I'll be thousands of miles from you.

623
01:00:42,141 --> 01:00:45,666
Does your husband know this story?.

624
01:00:50,260 --> 01:00:52,593
So I'm the only one?.

625
01:00:53,648 --> 01:00:55,514
Yes.

626
01:01:02,343 --> 01:01:05,780
I'm the only one who knows!

627
01:01:05,700 --> 01:01:07,635
Be quiet.

628
01:01:40,708 --> 01:01:43,437
It's so nice sometimes
to be with someone!

629
01:01:45,886 --> 01:01:47,547
Yes.

630
01:01:53,910 --> 01:01:56,037
Tell me more.

631
01:01:57,074 --> 01:01:58,474
Tell me.

632
01:02:05,610 --> 01:02:09,068
In a few years.
when I have forgotten you.

633
01:02:09,733 --> 01:02:13,430
and other adventures like this one

634
01:02:13,345 --> 01:02:18,478
will happen to me
from sheer force of habit.

635
01:02:19,645 --> 01:02:25,174
I'll remember you
as the symbol of love's forgetfulness.

636
01:02:25,398 --> 01:02:29,199
I'll think of this story
as of the horror of forgetting.

637
01:02:29,202 --> 01:02:31,330
I already know it.

638
01:02:35,853 --> 01:02:39,949
Don't things ever stop
at night in Hiroshima?.

639
01:02:40,679 --> 01:02:43,479
No. they never stop.

640
01:02:44,995 --> 01:02:46,860
I like that.

641
01:02:47,616 --> 01:02:51,211
Cities where there's always
someone awake.

642
01:02:51,581 --> 01:02:54,641
day or night.

643
01:04:18,153 --> 01:04:22,988
Sometimes we have to avoid thinking
about the problems life presents.

644
01:04:23,875 --> 01:04:27,539
Otherwise we'd suffocate.

645
01:04:34,393 --> 01:04:36,861
Get away from me.

646
01:04:37,333 --> 01:04:40,233
The sun hasn't risen yet.

647
01:04:44,876 --> 01:04:48,835
We'll probably die
without ever seeing each other again.

648
01:04:50,408 --> 01:04:52,899
Yes. probably.

649
01:04:54,148 --> 01:04:57,142
Unless. perhaps. one day...

650
01:04:58,336 --> 01:05:00,100
a war...

651
01:05:02,173 --> 01:05:03,969
Yes.

652
01:05:04,730 --> 01:05:06,561
A war.

653
01:07:49,337 --> 01:07:51,668
You think you Know,

654
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:54,697
but no.

655
01:07:54,995 --> 01:07:56,861
Never.

656
01:08:04,331 --> 01:08:08,427
In her youth in Nevers
she had a German love.

657
01:08:10,563 --> 01:08:13,795
We'll go to Bavaria. my love.

658
01:08:14,081 --> 01:08:16,605
and we'll get married.

659
01:08:18,269 --> 01:08:21,237
She never went to Bavaria.

660
01:08:23,735 --> 01:08:27,536
Let those who never went to Bavaria
dare speak to her of love!

661
01:08:29,009 --> 01:08:31,671
You were not quite dead yet.

662
01:08:32,143 --> 01:08:34,704
I told our story.

663
01:08:35,211 --> 01:08:38,511
I cheated on you tonight
with that stranger.

664
01:08:38,601 --> 01:08:41,365
I told our story.

665
01:08:41,414 --> 01:08:43,974
You see, it was there to tell.

666
01:08:44,067 --> 01:08:49,505
Fourteen years since I've tasted
an impossible love!

667
01:08:50,430 --> 01:08:52,397
Since Nevers.

668
01:08:52,476 --> 01:08:54,500
Look how I'm forgetting you.

669
01:08:54,682 --> 01:08:56,649
Look how I've forgotten you.

670
01:08:56,854 --> 01:08:58,790
Look at me.

671
01:09:44,839 --> 01:09:47,104
I'm going to stay in Hiroshima.

672
01:09:47,812 --> 01:09:51,011
With him. Every night.

673
01:09:51,361 --> 01:09:53,830
In Hiroshima.

674
01:09:53,791 --> 01:09:57,284
I'm going to stay here. Here.

675
01:10:07,376 --> 01:10:10,370
Stay in Hiroshima.

676
01:10:11,662 --> 01:10:16,122
Of course I'll stay in Hiroshima

677
01:10:17,448 --> 01:10:19,438
with you.

678
01:10:22,595 --> 01:10:25,290
I 'm so miserable!

679
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:29,800
I wasn't expecting this at all.
You understand?.

680
01:10:40,658 --> 01:10:42,487
Go away!

681
01:10:44,877 --> 01:10:47,277
I couldn't possibly leave you.

682
01:11:10,963 --> 01:11:14,524
Stay in Hiroshima with me.

683
01:11:21,544 --> 01:11:24,273
He's going to walk towards me.

684
01:11:24,773 --> 01:11:27,570
He's going to take me by the shoulders.

685
01:11:28,642 --> 01:11:30,769
He's going to Kiss me.

686
01:11:31,616 --> 01:11:35,312
He's going to Kiss me and I'll be lost.

687
01:12:36,063 --> 01:12:38,190
I meet you.

688
01:12:38,493 --> 01:12:40,984
I remember you.

689
01:12:41,723 --> 01:12:44,815
This city was tailor-made for love.

690
01:12:45,590 --> 01:12:48,923
You fit my body like a glove.

691
01:12:49,586 --> 01:12:53,387
Who are you? You're destroying me.

692
01:12:53,870 --> 01:12:55,530
I was hungry.

693
01:12:55,533 --> 01:12:57,466
Hungry for infidelity,

694
01:12:57,643 --> 01:13:01,634
for adultery, for lies,

695
01:13:01,542 --> 01:13:03,374
and for death.

696
01:13:03,363 --> 01:13:05,162
I always have been.

697
01:13:07,936 --> 01:13:11,269
I had no doubt
you'd cross my path one day.

698
01:13:11,805 --> 01:13:17,106
I waited for you calmly,
with boundless impatience.

699
01:13:19,638 --> 01:13:21,696
Devour me.

700
01:13:22,035 --> 01:13:24,297
Deform me to your likeness,

701
01:13:24,272 --> 01:13:27,765
so that no one after you
will ever again understand

702
01:13:27,692 --> 01:13:30,422
the reason for so much desire.

703
01:13:32,137 --> 01:13:35,196
We'll be alone, my love.

704
01:13:35,459 --> 01:13:37,395
Night will never end.

705
01:13:37,955 --> 01:13:41,119
The day will never dawn again
on anyone.

706
01:13:41,248 --> 01:13:44,272
Never again.

707
01:13:44,414 --> 01:13:46,244
At last.

708
01:13:54,707 --> 01:13:57,039
You're still destroying me.

709
01:13:57,711 --> 01:13:59,907
You're good for me.

710
01:14:01,131 --> 01:14:05,831
We'll mourn the departed day
in good conscience and with goodwill.

711
01:14:06,119 --> 01:14:09,384
There'll be nothing else for us to do

712
01:14:09,540 --> 01:14:12,202
but mourn the departed day.

713
01:14:12,705 --> 01:14:16,800
Time will pass. Only time.

714
01:14:18,234 --> 01:14:20,636
And a time will come

715
01:14:21,464 --> 01:14:27,165
when we can no longer name
what it is that binds us.

716
01:14:28,786 --> 01:14:32,221
Its name will gradually
be erased from our memory

717
01:14:32,493 --> 01:14:36,327
until it vanishes completely.

718
01:15:06,923 --> 01:15:10,984
Perhaps there's a chance you'll stay.

719
01:15:12,103 --> 01:15:13,865
You know very well.

720
01:15:13,860 --> 01:15:16,590
Staying is even more impossible
than leaving.

721
01:15:16,545 --> 01:15:18,309
A week.

722
01:15:20,638 --> 01:15:22,229
Three days.

723
01:15:22,236 --> 01:15:24,500
Time enough for what?.

724
01:15:24,475 --> 01:15:26,963
To live from it?. To die from it?.

725
01:15:26,999 --> 01:15:29,264
Time enough to know which.

726
01:15:30,291 --> 01:15:32,557
There is no such thing.

727
01:15:32,850 --> 01:15:36,081
Neither time enough to live from it.
nor time enough to die from it.

728
01:15:38,701 --> 01:15:40,828
So I don't give a damn.

729
01:15:41,993 --> 01:15:46,726
I would prefer
you had died in Nevers.

730
01:15:47,684 --> 01:15:49,708
So would I.

731
01:15:50,849 --> 01:15:53,784
But I didn't die in Nevers.

732
01:16:43,533 --> 01:16:46,000
Nevers, you whom I'd forgotten,

733
01:16:46,089 --> 01:16:48,717
tonight I'd like to see you again.

734
01:16:49,958 --> 01:16:53,085
Night after night,
month after month, I set you afire

735
01:16:53,858 --> 01:16:56,953
while my body was ablaze
with his memory.

736
01:17:31,965 --> 01:17:36,096
While my body is still ablaze
with the memory of you,

737
01:17:36,792 --> 01:17:39,488
I'd like to see Nevers once again.

738
01:17:39,795 --> 01:17:41,789
The Loire.

739
01:17:42,387 --> 01:17:45,651
Lovely poplar trees of Nièvre,

740
01:17:46,222 --> 01:17:48,350
I give you up to oblivion.

741
01:17:49,868 --> 01:17:52,598
Dime-store romance,

742
01:17:52,937 --> 01:17:54,961
I consign you to oblivion.

743
01:17:56,229 --> 01:18:01,257
One night without you
and I waited for day to deliver me.

744
01:18:02,110 --> 01:18:07,845
One day without his eyes and she dies,
the young girl from Nevers,

745
01:18:08,282 --> 01:18:10,978
shameless young girl from Nevers.

746
01:18:11,252 --> 01:18:15,189
One day without his hands
and she Knows the pain of love.

747
01:18:15,475 --> 01:18:17,534
Silly little girl

748
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:19,785
who died of love in Nevers.

749
01:18:19,791 --> 01:18:21,882
Little girl from Nevers
with shaven head,

750
01:18:21,869 --> 01:18:24,530
this evening
I relinquish you to oblivion.

751
01:18:24,776 --> 01:18:27,473
Dime-store romance.

752
01:18:28,133 --> 01:18:33,628
As it was with him,
forgetting will begin with your eyes.

753
01:18:34,335 --> 01:18:39,796
Then, as with him,
it will swallow your voice.

754
01:18:40,921 --> 01:18:45,551
Then, as with him,
it will consume you entirely,

755
01:18:45,429 --> 01:18:47,486
Little by little.

756
01:18:47,922 --> 01:18:51,518
You will become a song.

757
01:19:06,304 --> 01:19:08,795
Who is she?.

758
01:19:09,245 --> 01:19:11,270
A Frenchwoman.

759
01:19:16,821 --> 01:19:18,948
What's the matter?.

760
01:19:21,649 --> 01:19:24,244
She's leaving Japan in a little while.

761
01:19:25,708 --> 01:19:31,080
We're sad at having
to leave each other.

762
01:24:38,011 --> 01:24:40,945
I had to come.

763
01:25:11,291 --> 01:25:13,882
I'll forget you.
I'm forgetting you already!

764
01:25:13,848 --> 01:25:16,782
Look how I'm forgetting you!
Look at me!

765
01:25:38,814 --> 01:25:41,011
That's your name.

766
01:25:41,309 --> 01:25:43,971
Yes. That's my name.

767
01:25:46,070 --> 01:25:49,939
And your name is Nevers.

768
01:25:50,291 --> 01:25:53,658
Nevers in France.

769
01:25:58,125 --> 01:26:01,116
THE END
