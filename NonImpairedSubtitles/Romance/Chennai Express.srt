1
00:01:44,818 --> 00:01:46,376
Myself Rahul.

2
00:01:46,486 --> 00:01:47,885
I am 40 years old.

3
00:01:47,954 --> 00:01:52,857
Normally at this agein one's
life there comes a big twist.

4
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:55,685
I also experienced something big.

5
00:01:55,962 --> 00:01:57,088
I mean, really big.

6
00:01:57,631 --> 00:01:59,496
One that changed my life.

7
00:02:05,138 --> 00:02:07,538
Actually let's startat
the very beginning.

8
00:02:15,549 --> 00:02:18,416
Since I was a kid I have been
living in this house with my...

9
00:02:18,485 --> 00:02:20,510
grandfather,
grandmother, motherand father.

10
00:02:20,587 --> 00:02:23,784
My parents passed away
when I was eight years old...

11
00:02:23,857 --> 00:02:26,189
My grandparentstook care of me.

12
00:02:26,626 --> 00:02:29,151
When I was a child it was quite
obvious thatl was rather cute.

13
00:02:29,229 --> 00:02:31,561
People would pull
my cheeks and say...

14
00:02:31,631 --> 00:02:33,826
So Sweet!

15
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,892
And this sweetness was
in my grandfathers' shop.

16
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:38,733
Y. Y. Mithaiwala (Sweet Seller).

17
00:02:38,805 --> 00:02:41,831
In Mumbai, the outlets of
our shop, surpassed the greenery.

18
00:02:41,908 --> 00:02:44,502
Brother, please pack six samosasand
half a kilo of the fried sweet.

19
00:02:46,446 --> 00:02:47,743
Brother!!

20
00:02:47,814 --> 00:02:48,678
Why?

21
00:02:48,748 --> 00:02:50,045
Why? Mithaiwala!!

22
00:02:50,484 --> 00:02:53,248
And my grandfatherwould
also interferein my love life...

23
00:02:53,487 --> 00:02:54,954
at times he would call...

24
00:02:55,021 --> 00:02:58,548
and at times he himselfwould
show up in person in person.

25
00:02:58,625 --> 00:03:00,252
I never got the chance
to be in a relationship,

26
00:03:00,494 --> 00:03:02,485
...and clearly marriage
was out of the question.

27
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:05,659
Six, six!!

28
00:03:05,732 --> 00:03:08,565
Rahul, did you see
the way Sachin plays! Wow!!

29
00:03:08,635 --> 00:03:11,866
Though my grandfatherwas a
die hard fanof Sachin Tendulkar...

30
00:03:11,938 --> 00:03:14,736
he never applied the
word 'die' in his life.

31
00:03:15,108 --> 00:03:17,702
Time passed on but he did not.

32
00:03:17,878 --> 00:03:19,937
All my relatives settled abroad.

33
00:03:20,013 --> 00:03:22,174
And then came 2013.

34
00:03:22,249 --> 00:03:24,809
My grandfathers' 100th birthday!

35
00:03:24,885 --> 00:03:29,219
Apart from my grandfather I have
two more tragedies in my life...

36
00:03:29,289 --> 00:03:31,655
my friends Bobby and Salim.

37
00:03:31,925 --> 00:03:32,289
Hi Rahul.

38
00:03:32,526 --> 00:03:33,083
Hi.

39
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:34,558
All set for Goa?

40
00:03:34,628 --> 00:03:35,151
Goa?

41
00:03:35,228 --> 00:03:37,753
Once you reach there
don't be naughty at forty huh!

42
00:03:37,831 --> 00:03:39,958
And both of you,
mind your own business!

43
00:03:40,033 --> 00:03:43,025
Tanu, can you just
help me for a minute here?

44
00:03:43,803 --> 00:03:45,168
What is this new story
you two have been cooking?

45
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:47,834
Not just the two,
this includes all of us.

46
00:03:47,908 --> 00:03:51,309
Rahul, it's grandpa's birthday
but the gift is for you.

47
00:03:51,545 --> 00:03:53,069
Hot NRI women!

48
00:03:53,146 --> 00:03:54,306
I've already spoken to them.

49
00:03:54,548 --> 00:03:58,211
In Goa we will be with themfor
a 6 days - 7 nights fixed package!

50
00:03:58,285 --> 00:04:00,515
What sort of friends are you?
One week!

51
00:04:00,587 --> 00:04:02,248
How will grandpa
let me go for a week?

52
00:04:03,557 --> 00:04:04,046
Just a minute.

53
00:04:04,124 --> 00:04:05,022
He's an idiot!

54
00:04:05,091 --> 00:04:06,752
- But you are also an idiot! - Rahul...

55
00:04:06,826 --> 00:04:08,225
Come here.

56
00:04:08,295 --> 00:04:09,523
Grandpa.

57
00:04:10,564 --> 00:04:12,623
Sir, you come with me.

58
00:04:14,134 --> 00:04:15,066
Yes, grandpa.

59
00:04:15,769 --> 00:04:17,703
Yes, you brought
me a gift didn't you?

60
00:04:18,905 --> 00:04:23,069
You haven't yet opened the gifts
given byVimal, Renu and the others...

61
00:04:23,143 --> 00:04:26,169
They are others, not 'ours'.

62
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:28,144
I am going to be a 100.

63
00:04:28,214 --> 00:04:30,079
I will say very important things.

64
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:33,608
They only like me
because we're related.

65
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:38,118
You love me which
is why we are related!

66
00:04:38,558 --> 00:04:43,689
I wonderwhat will
happento you once pass on.

67
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:44,762
Grandpa...

68
00:04:44,831 --> 00:04:47,891
Here we go! I've also
begunto talk about leaving...

69
00:04:47,968 --> 00:04:50,027
its hardly my age
to talk of leaving...

70
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:54,169
Why do we talk about what
is to happen 20 to 25 years later.

71
00:04:55,609 --> 00:04:57,634
Come on, give it to me.

72
00:04:58,211 --> 00:04:59,143
Yes.

73
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,142
Wow!

74
00:05:03,116 --> 00:05:05,641
A bat autographed by Sachin!

75
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,118
Come on, hit!

76
00:05:10,924 --> 00:05:15,657
It was Rahul's idea to open
a franchiseof your shop in Goa.

77
00:05:15,729 --> 00:05:16,696
Yes go ahead and open it.

78
00:05:16,763 --> 00:05:17,923
Why are you wasting yourtime here?

79
00:05:17,998 --> 00:05:20,762
Grandpa, we have already seen
an amazing land plot in Panjim.

80
00:05:20,834 --> 00:05:23,667
We are going with Rahul
to finalize the plot.

81
00:05:23,737 --> 00:05:25,705
Go.

82
00:05:25,772 --> 00:05:29,173
Oh come on,
Sachin, hit it beyond the boundary!

83
00:05:31,378 --> 00:05:34,836
Six! Sachin is on 99.

84
00:05:34,914 --> 00:05:36,404
Sachin is on 99!!

85
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:38,948
Sachin is on 99!!

86
00:05:52,565 --> 00:05:54,931
What grandma?
So much excitement for a century.

87
00:05:55,001 --> 00:05:56,696
It's just a game.
He will make it again.

88
00:06:03,576 --> 00:06:04,975
Grandpa!

89
00:06:05,679 --> 00:06:09,171
Both grandpa and Sachin
were knocked out at 99!

90
00:06:11,818 --> 00:06:13,683
It was a strange feeling.

91
00:06:14,421 --> 00:06:16,787
But then I read somewhere that...

92
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:20,517
a person's death is already
predestined before his birth.

93
00:06:20,794 --> 00:06:23,058
I thought to myself
if what has to...

94
00:06:23,129 --> 00:06:25,620
happen has already happenedwhat
difference does it make?

95
00:06:25,699 --> 00:06:28,862
After all grandpa was alive since
the invention ofall India radio...

96
00:06:28,935 --> 00:06:30,163
...tothe advent of Twitter.

97
00:06:30,236 --> 00:06:32,067
He lived a good life.

98
00:06:32,138 --> 00:06:32,900
That's it!

99
00:06:32,972 --> 00:06:34,166
At that very moment...

100
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,935
I had made a decision.

101
00:06:36,609 --> 00:06:38,668
Goa is on!

102
00:06:43,249 --> 00:06:45,877
Grandma, I want to
do something more in life.

103
00:06:45,952 --> 00:06:48,045
I want to do something
my heart tells me to do.

104
00:06:49,222 --> 00:06:52,157
I cannot handle Y.
Y. Mithaiwala now.

105
00:06:53,026 --> 00:06:57,122
Grandma, even I have some dreams.
Till now I've just let my age catch on.

106
00:06:58,198 --> 00:07:00,758
But now I want to see
the world and learn things.

107
00:07:01,968 --> 00:07:05,165
Grandma, I really want
to live life on my own terms.

108
00:07:05,872 --> 00:07:10,832
Rahul, with the property you've already
begunto live life on your own terms.

109
00:07:10,977 --> 00:07:14,879
Live your life the way you
want to, nobody is stopping you.

110
00:07:16,616 --> 00:07:19,983
But you will have to do me a favor.

111
00:07:20,587 --> 00:07:21,781
Yes tell me, grandma.

112
00:07:21,888 --> 00:07:23,981
It was your grandfather's
last wish...

113
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:26,520
that after he died...

114
00:07:26,593 --> 00:07:30,290
half of his ashes wouldbe
immersed into the Ganga...

115
00:07:31,231 --> 00:07:34,098
and the other half in Rameshwaram.

116
00:07:34,501 --> 00:07:35,297
Rameshwaram?

117
00:07:35,535 --> 00:07:39,232
Yes. I will go along with Anshuand
immerse his ashes into the Ganga...

118
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:42,199
but you will have
to go to Rameshwaram...

119
00:07:42,275 --> 00:07:44,675
...to pour out the
other half of his ashes.

120
00:07:44,744 --> 00:07:45,972
Grandma, me?

121
00:07:46,246 --> 00:07:47,577
Yes, you!

122
00:07:47,647 --> 00:07:51,777
This was your grandfather's last
wish, you will have to fulfil it.

123
00:07:55,455 --> 00:07:57,980
This Rameshwaram
is at the end of India!

124
00:07:58,158 --> 00:08:00,126
That too in the exactopposite
direction as Goa!

125
00:08:02,695 --> 00:08:03,719
One minute guys!

126
00:08:03,797 --> 00:08:04,855
Salim, give me that.

127
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:10,125
The waters of Goa must be
flowing up to Rameshwaram, right?

128
00:08:10,837 --> 00:08:11,895
What do you mean?

129
00:08:11,971 --> 00:08:15,805
What he means is that if we pour out
Grandpa's ashes in the waters of Goa...

130
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:18,742
It will eventually float
and reach Rameshwaram.

131
00:08:18,812 --> 00:08:20,939
Yes, but Goa and
Rameshwaramare miles away.

132
00:08:21,047 --> 00:08:23,538
Oh, we are going
to makethem coincide...

133
00:08:23,917 --> 00:08:24,906
What does that mean?

134
00:08:25,051 --> 00:08:27,781
Goa is on!

135
00:08:28,121 --> 00:08:28,712
Yes, Rahul.

136
00:08:28,788 --> 00:08:29,846
Bobby, change of plan.

137
00:08:29,923 --> 00:08:31,481
What? You're coming to Goa right?

138
00:08:31,624 --> 00:08:32,613
Of course, I'm coming.

139
00:08:32,692 --> 00:08:35,957
But to fool grandma we have
to begin our journey by train.

140
00:08:36,029 --> 00:08:36,961
What?

141
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:39,863
Grandma is going
to come to see me off.

142
00:08:39,933 --> 00:08:41,093
So in the next two hours...

143
00:08:41,167 --> 00:08:43,431
...I will buy a ticket
to any train going to South India.

144
00:08:43,503 --> 00:08:46,097
I will get on the train, and I
will get off at the Kalyan station.

145
00:08:46,172 --> 00:08:50,233
You guys wait for me there,
we will travel by road from there.

146
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:54,773
Which means, Goa is on!

147
00:09:00,019 --> 00:09:01,213
Let's go, grandpa.

148
00:09:11,698 --> 00:09:12,858
Chennai Express?

149
00:09:13,032 --> 00:09:14,897
Yes, Chennai Express.

150
00:09:15,869 --> 00:09:20,067
As much as I know, I don't think
Chennai Express goes to Rameshwaram.

151
00:09:21,507 --> 00:09:22,599
You did not understand.

152
00:09:22,675 --> 00:09:26,509
Didn't I tell you that I want
to spend more time with grandpa?

153
00:09:26,579 --> 00:09:29,946
So I am taking the long
routenot the wrong route.

154
00:09:30,516 --> 00:09:34,111
I will get off at Chennai
and take the road to Rameshwaram.

155
00:09:34,187 --> 00:09:35,017
Rahul...

156
00:09:35,922 --> 00:09:40,689
do you know why I am taking
your grandpa's ashes to the Ganga?

157
00:09:41,628 --> 00:09:44,495
It's because I don't
trust anyone here.

158
00:09:44,831 --> 00:09:49,234
But I have complete faith...

159
00:09:49,836 --> 00:09:53,670
that you will immerse your
grandpa's ashes withutmost...

160
00:09:54,073 --> 00:09:56,507
...sincerity in the
waters of Rameshwaram.

161
00:10:06,452 --> 00:10:10,149
I did not like lying
to grandma one bit.

162
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:13,117
But by then,
I had already done that.

163
00:10:24,804 --> 00:10:25,065
Hello.

164
00:10:25,138 --> 00:10:27,572
Rahul, where are you, man?
We have already reached Kalyan.

165
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,540
Yes, I'm already in the trainafter
bidding farewell to Grandma.

166
00:10:29,609 --> 00:10:30,769
I will be reaching shortly.

167
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:48,083
Rahul's arrived.

168
00:10:49,195 --> 00:10:50,924
Rahul, where were you?

169
00:10:50,997 --> 00:10:52,828
I've come, right?

170
00:10:52,899 --> 00:10:53,661
Now it's going to be fun!

171
00:10:53,733 --> 00:10:54,791
Yes!!

172
00:10:54,867 --> 00:10:55,993
Ash!

173
00:10:56,069 --> 00:10:56,660
What happened now?

174
00:10:56,736 --> 00:10:58,203
The ashes!

175
00:10:58,271 --> 00:10:59,101
Granpa's ash!

176
00:10:59,172 --> 00:11:00,537
No Rahul... No.

177
00:11:00,606 --> 00:11:01,732
Rahul, listen to us!

178
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:25,588
Thanks.

179
00:12:25,725 --> 00:12:26,692
No, It's okay.

180
00:12:26,859 --> 00:12:28,121
I've done this before.

181
00:12:28,194 --> 00:12:30,890
Actually I've. Sorry I should go.

182
00:13:12,972 --> 00:13:15,202
Meenamma, what did you think?

183
00:13:15,274 --> 00:13:17,208
That you could get away from us?

184
00:13:17,276 --> 00:13:18,641
What you are doing
is totally wrong!

185
00:13:18,711 --> 00:13:21,236
Don't try to preach to us.

186
00:13:21,314 --> 00:13:21,973
Excuse me.

187
00:13:22,215 --> 00:13:23,546
What are you guys fighting about?

188
00:13:23,616 --> 00:13:26,710
People miss catching trains, because of
you people I missed my platform.

189
00:13:27,253 --> 00:13:27,719
Hi!

190
00:13:31,624 --> 00:13:32,522
Meenama.

191
00:13:35,261 --> 00:13:36,956
It's all right.

192
00:13:45,738 --> 00:13:46,670
Hi.

193
00:13:49,475 --> 00:13:50,772
That's my seat.

194
00:13:51,911 --> 00:13:53,344
My seat- um.

195
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:54,668
May I?

196
00:13:55,014 --> 00:13:56,276
Thank you.

197
00:14:00,419 --> 00:14:01,317
Sorry!

198
00:14:01,554 --> 00:14:02,919
Sorry to you, sir. One second...

199
00:14:02,989 --> 00:14:04,980
Take it out... nonsense.

200
00:14:05,925 --> 00:14:07,415
I am sorry.

201
00:14:07,894 --> 00:14:10,419
I am a little fat.

202
00:14:23,543 --> 00:14:24,737
It's mine.

203
00:14:25,912 --> 00:14:26,571
Hello.

204
00:14:26,646 --> 00:14:27,908
Rahul, where are you?

205
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,311
I am in the train.

206
00:14:29,382 --> 00:14:30,041
In the train?

207
00:14:30,283 --> 00:14:31,875
I didn't have the
chance to get out.

208
00:14:32,618 --> 00:14:33,880
So, this is what
we are going to do...

209
00:14:34,453 --> 00:14:36,387
we will meet at Karjat Station.

210
00:14:36,522 --> 00:14:37,648
And listen...

211
00:14:38,024 --> 00:14:39,685
don't worry about me...

212
00:14:40,293 --> 00:14:41,920
I've got great company.

213
00:14:42,295 --> 00:14:43,819
You found her, huh?

214
00:14:45,064 --> 00:14:46,964
Yes, she is sitting
right in front of me.

215
00:14:47,967 --> 00:14:48,991
What hair!

216
00:14:49,068 --> 00:14:50,262
What amazing eyes!

217
00:14:50,336 --> 00:14:51,360
What lips!

218
00:14:51,537 --> 00:14:53,471
You are naming parts
of her body in front of her,

219
00:14:53,539 --> 00:14:54,972
does she not have her sandals on?

220
00:14:55,608 --> 00:14:57,041
She doesn't understand Hindi.

221
00:14:57,843 --> 00:15:00,311
Hey wait, she's looking at me.

222
00:15:00,846 --> 00:15:02,711
She's probably looking
at me with love.

223
00:15:02,782 --> 00:15:04,807
Make sure you check
she's not blind.

224
00:15:04,884 --> 00:15:06,044
Shut up man.

225
00:15:06,285 --> 00:15:09,083
But its possible thatshe
may get blinded by my love.

226
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:14,351
Okay listen,
lets meet at Karjat Station na...

227
00:15:14,727 --> 00:15:16,718
till then I will
keep myself busy here.

228
00:15:17,396 --> 00:15:19,830
Hopefully,
I should be able to get her along.

229
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:31,567
When I saw you I knew my dear...

230
00:15:33,613 --> 00:15:37,709
that love is crazy my dear...

231
00:15:38,851 --> 00:15:39,943
Now where do I go...

232
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:47,721
What makes you thinkdon't
understand Hindi?

233
00:15:49,629 --> 00:15:57,798
The ones who you helpedare
here to kidnap me.

234
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:58,894
Kidnap?

235
00:16:00,606 --> 00:16:04,167
I'm in big trouble.

236
00:16:05,111 --> 00:16:08,740
So will you help me?

237
00:16:08,814 --> 00:16:13,376
So that they don't
suspect anything...

238
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:17,922
talk to me through songs.

239
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:24,088
Grant me forgiveness,
for I have wronged you.

240
00:16:24,163 --> 00:16:27,030
I had no idea you
knew the language.

241
00:16:27,099 --> 00:16:30,398
I will do as you say now.

242
00:16:30,469 --> 00:16:33,836
Since I've made a mistake,
I should pay the penalty.

243
00:16:33,906 --> 00:16:35,100
Hi...

244
00:16:37,176 --> 00:16:40,111
Don't you worry!

245
00:16:40,179 --> 00:16:43,546
I am here!

246
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:48,079
Meenamma.

247
00:16:48,487 --> 00:16:49,818
You sing.

248
00:16:51,557 --> 00:16:56,654
So you go to... go to the toilet.

249
00:16:58,798 --> 00:17:03,428
So you go to...
you go to the toilet.

250
00:17:04,503 --> 00:17:05,629
Toilet...

251
00:17:06,605 --> 00:17:11,065
but why are you sending
me to the toilet?

252
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:15,579
What is it that you intend to do,
tell me?

253
00:17:16,215 --> 00:17:17,682
Your...

254
00:17:17,817 --> 00:17:20,945
I will use your
phone to make a call.

255
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:24,786
I will inform my friends.

256
00:17:24,857 --> 00:17:32,992
Toilet toilet... go to the toilet.

257
00:17:33,065 --> 00:17:34,555
Toilet!

258
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:37,168
Call! Nature's call.

259
00:17:37,636 --> 00:17:40,070
Hello, Nature? I am calling...

260
00:17:40,139 --> 00:17:41,902

261
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:51,440

00:17:52,752 --> 00:17:54,117

heardthe name before.

263

00:18:10,536 --> 00:18:11,901
Of course, you can.

272
00:18:17,743 --> 00:18:19,836
Meenamma, what did you think...

273
00:18:19,912 --> 00:18:21,573
You would call and
we wouldn't notice?

274
00:18:25,651 --> 00:18:26,583
What the heck?

275
00:18:26,852 --> 00:18:27,648
That was my phone.

276
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,915
My friends are waiting for me at the
Karjat Station, how will I contact them?

277
00:18:29,989 --> 00:18:32,787

I will sue you!

280
00:18:36,996 --> 00:18:38,588
That was my phone, my phone!

281
00:18:38,664 --> 00:18:40,222
Meenamma, what is he saying?

282
00:18:40,733 --> 00:18:42,564
It was his phone.

283
00:18:42,635 --> 00:18:44,034
If I knew that earlier...

284
00:18:44,103 --> 00:18:45,934
I would have thrown
him out with the phone.

285
00:18:46,272 --> 00:18:48,536
What pai pai is he doing?

286
00:18:48,607 --> 00:18:50,507
He's saying had they knownthe
phone belonged to you...

287
00:18:50,576 --> 00:18:51,873
they would throw
you outwith the phone.

288
00:18:51,944 --> 00:18:52,808
Oh really?

289
00:18:52,878 --> 00:18:55,073
Is this yourfather's kingdom?

290
00:18:55,147 --> 00:18:56,011
Are you trying to scare me?

291
00:18:56,081 --> 00:18:57,173
Are you threatening me?

292
00:18:57,249 --> 00:18:58,648
I will show you!

293
00:19:00,753 --> 00:19:02,015

294
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,224
Enough! This is too much.

295
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:15,162
You have made me so
angry thatl will sit down.

296
00:19:16,068 --> 00:19:19,003
And if I sit down don't think
I won't be able to stand up again.

297
00:19:19,071 --> 00:19:21,539
And if I stand up don't think...

298
00:19:21,607 --> 00:19:22,938
I cannot sit down again.

299
00:19:30,115 --> 00:19:31,548
And I forgive you
forthe mobile too.

300
00:19:31,617 --> 00:19:33,278
I can buy out the entire
mobile company if I want to.

301
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:37,182
4G, 5G, I have a lot of money.

302
00:19:38,123 --> 00:19:39,249
Poor people.

303
00:19:41,093 --> 00:19:42,025
Okay!

304
00:19:52,872 --> 00:19:53,839

00:19:56,442 --> 00:19:57,568

Ticket No.

309
00:20:02,882 --> 00:20:05,715
If you don't have a ticket
then you will have to pay a fine.

310
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:13,082
I have my ticket.

311
00:20:15,027 --> 00:20:16,790
You call this a ticket.

312
00:20:16,862 --> 00:20:18,557
If you don't have a ticket
then you will have to pay a fine.

313
00:20:18,631 --> 00:20:19,529
From where have
you boarded the train?

314
00:20:19,598 --> 00:20:20,565
Are they with you?

315
00:20:20,633 --> 00:20:23,067
Listen to me very carefully TC...

316
00:20:23,135 --> 00:20:26,002
don't take it easy
on these hooligans.

317
00:20:26,071 --> 00:20:28,562
Something is very, very fishy.

318
00:20:28,641 --> 00:20:29,539
Fishy?

319
00:20:30,943 --> 00:20:36,609
I swear all four of them
are carrying long weapons.

320
00:20:37,917 --> 00:20:43,082
These fourfriends have abducted this
girl and taking her very far away.

321
00:20:43,455 --> 00:20:44,945
Very carefully.

322
00:20:48,561 --> 00:20:49,892
Come on, get up.

323
00:20:50,462 --> 00:20:51,861
Come, come.

324
00:20:51,931 --> 00:20:52,727
Come on.

325
00:20:52,798 --> 00:20:55,164
Hey... song?

326
00:20:56,101 --> 00:20:58,399
Hey... song...

327
00:20:58,637 --> 00:21:01,162
Now you will be in trouble.

328
00:21:01,407 --> 00:21:03,932
You can go to jail
andplay ping pong!

329
00:21:04,009 --> 00:21:06,671
You think you are King Kong?

330
00:21:06,946 --> 00:21:08,413
What aaa?

331
00:21:08,781 --> 00:21:12,410
Don't underestimate
the power of a common man.

332
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:16,647
And Meenamma, you
are on my watch now.

333
00:21:16,855 --> 00:21:18,550
Now the TC is on our side...

334
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:20,782
you see how he
straightens them out.

335
00:21:37,443 --> 00:21:38,535
Enough!

336
00:21:39,044 --> 00:21:40,102
This is too much.

337
00:21:40,913 --> 00:21:45,850
You all have made me so
angry that now I have to sit.

338
00:21:46,819 --> 00:21:48,946
You sing and dance.

339
00:21:49,021 --> 00:21:51,717
We are going by Chennai Express.

340
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:55,724
You laugh and cry. We
are going by Chennai Express.

341
00:21:58,030 --> 00:21:59,429
Meenamma?

342
00:21:59,531 --> 00:22:03,058
Whatever happened with the TC,
you are the sol witness to it.

343
00:22:03,736 --> 00:22:06,933
That is why you will come with usto
Komban village on Chennai Express.

344
00:22:07,006 --> 00:22:09,065
On Chennai Express!

345
00:22:30,663 --> 00:22:32,961
All my hearts wishes were
washed awaywith these ashes.

346
00:22:33,032 --> 00:22:36,832
I had come to Goa to wash away the
ashesbut instead drowned the TC.

347
00:22:36,902 --> 00:22:39,928
My friends tried
to get in touch with me.

348
00:22:40,005 --> 00:22:41,267
But they could not
track me down because...

349
00:22:41,507 --> 00:22:45,637
my 35,000 rupee cell phonewas
lying somewhere on a train track...

350
00:22:45,711 --> 00:22:49,647
Okay 34,249!

351
00:23:22,481 --> 00:23:23,607
I want to sleep.

352
00:23:23,682 --> 00:23:24,740
Okay... you sleep.

353
00:23:25,117 --> 00:23:28,109
Periyanna,
check on the next station.

354
00:23:28,353 --> 00:23:29,149
I am hungry.

355
00:23:29,388 --> 00:23:30,082
Okay.

356
00:23:36,095 --> 00:23:37,153
Meenamma...

357
00:23:38,931 --> 00:23:39,863
what is happening?

358
00:23:40,065 --> 00:23:41,589
I cannot understand a thing.

359
00:23:41,667 --> 00:23:42,634
You are scolding your kidnappers?

360
00:23:42,701 --> 00:23:44,362
And they are quietly
listening to you?

361
00:23:44,803 --> 00:23:46,464
I'm confused!

362
00:23:47,606 --> 00:23:50,097
I will clear your confusion.

363
00:23:50,175 --> 00:23:50,971
Thank you.

364
00:23:52,778 --> 00:23:54,643
Let me start by introducing myself.

365
00:23:54,747 --> 00:23:57,079
My name is Meena Lochini
Adhaghu Sundaram.

366
00:23:57,149 --> 00:23:58,116
Hello.

367
00:23:59,017 --> 00:24:01,417
Daughter of Durgeshwara
Adhagh Sundaram.

368
00:24:02,788 --> 00:24:05,848
My father is a highly respected
manin the Komban area.

369
00:24:06,091 --> 00:24:06,955
Good...

370
00:24:07,392 --> 00:24:09,155
He is a... you know periyathalai.

371
00:24:10,529 --> 00:24:11,996
Periyathalai... Teacher?

372
00:24:12,664 --> 00:24:13,653
No.

373
00:24:14,433 --> 00:24:15,422
Don!

374
00:24:17,169 --> 00:24:20,434
These four are listening
to my pechi because...

375
00:24:20,506 --> 00:24:21,200
Pechi?

376
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:22,104
Talk.

377
00:24:22,174 --> 00:24:23,505
Talk... pechi.

378
00:24:23,575 --> 00:24:27,705
So they were listening to me talk
becausethey're my father's goons.

379
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:30,772
Goons... goons?

380
00:24:30,849 --> 00:24:34,114
Yes but don't worry
they are my cousin brother.

381
00:24:34,553 --> 00:24:35,713
Oh! It's like that.

382
00:24:37,456 --> 00:24:39,754
So mean okay!
You can't do that.

383
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:40,954
Sorry.

384
00:24:42,227 --> 00:24:47,221
My father had asked them to kidnap
me and bring me back to Komban.

385
00:24:47,466 --> 00:24:48,194
Oh God!

386
00:24:48,901 --> 00:24:50,801
That means yourfather
is the Godfather of the South.

387
00:24:50,869 --> 00:24:51,631
Yes.

388
00:24:52,437 --> 00:24:54,428
And he wants my
Kalyanam to be done.

389
00:24:54,506 --> 00:24:55,029
Kal...

390
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,172
You know marriage.

391
00:24:56,241 --> 00:24:56,866
Yes, Marriage.

392
00:24:57,109 --> 00:24:57,871
With Tangaballi.

393
00:24:58,010 --> 00:24:58,999
Tingabilla? What is Tingabilla?

394
00:24:59,077 --> 00:25:01,910
Yes, that is why I ran away!

395
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:03,174
I didn't understand.

396
00:25:03,749 --> 00:25:06,718
Tangaballi is my
father's friend's son.

397
00:25:06,785 --> 00:25:07,615
Okay.

398
00:25:07,686 --> 00:25:11,144
If I get married then my father
willown his friend's village too.

399
00:25:11,223 --> 00:25:11,746
Okay.

400
00:25:11,824 --> 00:25:14,054
Then fatherwill
become double powerful.

401
00:25:14,126 --> 00:25:15,058
Good.

402
00:25:15,194 --> 00:25:17,458
That's why my father
wantsto get me married.

403
00:25:21,834 --> 00:25:24,132
I don't even want to get married.

404
00:25:24,469 --> 00:25:25,766
He just doesn't understand!

405
00:25:28,841 --> 00:25:31,401
Now did you understand
the entire situations?

406
00:25:32,911 --> 00:25:33,570
No.

407
00:25:34,947 --> 00:25:37,211
No.

408
00:25:37,749 --> 00:25:42,015
This is yourfather, your goons,
your marriage; what's my fault?

409
00:25:42,888 --> 00:25:44,617
The problem is also yours,
kidnappingis also yours...

410
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:46,783
that ppppaammbbb... kkambb
villageis also yours...

411
00:25:46,859 --> 00:25:47,757
...and it's my neck on the line?

412
00:25:48,093 --> 00:25:50,584
That means, what is yours is mine?

413
00:25:50,662 --> 00:25:52,527
No, Meenamma.

414
00:25:52,598 --> 00:25:56,864
People fly kites in the air, your goons
throw mobiles and TCs in the air!

415
00:25:56,935 --> 00:25:59,233
I was quietly and
happily going to Goa.

416
00:25:59,972 --> 00:26:02,031
Goa is on! But no!

417
00:26:03,675 --> 00:26:06,974
Take the Chennai Express. Huh?

418
00:26:07,746 --> 00:26:10,476
Now my whole... whole
life is ruined!

419
00:26:10,916 --> 00:26:12,008
I am ruined!

420
00:26:44,149 --> 00:26:47,084
At night I thought of running away!

421
00:27:18,517 --> 00:27:20,747
When I opened my eyes in
the morning...

422
00:27:26,591 --> 00:27:27,489
Will you have an Idli?

423
00:27:27,559 --> 00:27:28,526
No.

424
00:27:35,834 --> 00:27:36,698
Just need to go.

425
00:27:36,935 --> 00:27:37,526
Will you eat?

426
00:27:37,602 --> 00:27:38,899
No, just need to go.

427
00:27:41,573 --> 00:27:43,438
Why is he not eating Idlis?

428
00:27:50,549 --> 00:27:52,278
Inspector sir...

429
00:27:52,351 --> 00:27:53,784
Wake up...

430
00:27:53,852 --> 00:27:55,251
Inspector sir.
I am being kidnapped.

431
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,412
Kidnapped by 4 cousin brothers...

432
00:27:56,488 --> 00:27:57,716
Please come and catch them.
They are criminals.

433
00:27:57,789 --> 00:27:58,949
Periya.

434
00:28:01,927 --> 00:28:03,360
What officer...

435
00:28:03,929 --> 00:28:06,693
Did you hearthesound
of this chicken?

436
00:28:08,266 --> 00:28:08,925
He said...

437
00:28:09,001 --> 00:28:11,299
Have you ever heard chickens?

438
00:28:24,383 --> 00:28:25,577
Check, if there anything to eat?

439
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:26,674
Okay.

440
00:28:27,953 --> 00:28:28,920
Meenamma...

441
00:28:29,721 --> 00:28:32,349
that policeman instead
of helping me, he...

442
00:28:32,791 --> 00:28:35,055
my father's reign begins from here.

443
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:37,821
The policemen are helpless.

444
00:28:37,896 --> 00:28:39,295
What? What do you mean?

445
00:28:39,798 --> 00:28:43,359
It means that no one
can do anythingto these four.

446
00:28:43,435 --> 00:28:45,699
That means from here
onanything can happen to me?

447
00:28:46,271 --> 00:28:46,828
Yes.

448
00:28:46,905 --> 00:28:48,896
That means I could
even lose my life here?

449
00:28:48,974 --> 00:28:49,463
Yes.

450
00:28:49,541 --> 00:28:51,475
All you are saying is -yes!

451
00:28:51,543 --> 00:28:54,011
Do you know you should nevertell a
dying person that he's about to die.

452
00:28:54,079 --> 00:28:57,845
At least give me some sort
of false hope that I will be saved.

453
00:28:58,450 --> 00:28:59,508
Okay.

454
00:28:59,751 --> 00:29:01,048
You can be saved.

455
00:29:02,554 --> 00:29:03,486
Feeling better?

456
00:29:03,955 --> 00:29:04,649
Feeling better!

457
00:29:04,723 --> 00:29:06,657
Now along with Grandpa's ashesmy
ashes will also be washed away.

458
00:29:06,725 --> 00:29:09,421
I don't know whyl gave you my hand?

459
00:29:10,462 --> 00:29:11,759
You gave me your hand?

460
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:14,822
In a bid to save myself I was running,
why did you help those four?

461
00:29:14,933 --> 00:29:16,992
Had I known that your
brothers were goons...

462
00:29:17,069 --> 00:29:18,331
I would have kicked them
instead of helping them.

463
00:29:18,403 --> 00:29:19,802
Anyway, you are the root
cause of this entire problem.

464
00:29:19,871 --> 00:29:22,339
Ever since you've come
into my life, my life sucks!

465
00:29:22,874 --> 00:29:24,000
- What? - Sucks!

466
00:29:24,509 --> 00:29:25,874
- Same here. - Okay.

467
00:29:30,649 --> 00:29:31,638
Why have you come to me?

468
00:29:32,317 --> 00:29:34,012
You've come to my side.

469
00:29:34,086 --> 00:29:36,850
Forget about sides, Meenamma.
Come to the point.

470
00:29:37,489 --> 00:29:40,117
Is there any way forthe two
of us to get out? Tell me, please!

471
00:29:41,026 --> 00:29:41,617
Please!

472
00:29:41,693 --> 00:29:43,354
Yes, there is.

473
00:29:43,762 --> 00:29:44,990
What is it? Please tell me...

474
00:29:46,131 --> 00:29:49,032
But you will have to do as I say.

475
00:29:49,868 --> 00:29:52,063
As if everything was
goingmy way till now.

476
00:29:52,471 --> 00:29:54,439
I'll do it,
tell me what has to be done?

477
00:29:55,974 --> 00:29:58,807
Once we reach Komban,
in front of my father...

478
00:29:58,877 --> 00:30:01,846
whenever I look towards you,
you just nod your head.

479
00:30:01,913 --> 00:30:02,538
Okay.

480
00:30:02,614 --> 00:30:03,774
Nod what?

481
00:30:04,883 --> 00:30:05,508
Head.

482
00:30:05,584 --> 00:30:06,778
What?

483
00:30:06,852 --> 00:30:07,978
- Head! - Okay.

484
00:30:08,053 --> 00:30:10,886
Nod my head.

485
00:30:10,956 --> 00:30:12,787
Nod my head.

486
00:30:12,858 --> 00:30:14,655
I will eat idlis, I will eat dosas,
I will nod my head.

487
00:30:14,726 --> 00:30:16,125
I will eat dosas...

488
00:30:16,595 --> 00:30:18,825
I am okay...

489
00:30:18,964 --> 00:30:21,524
Take the Chennai express.

490
00:30:34,146 --> 00:30:35,135
Hey Chinna...

491
00:30:35,447 --> 00:30:37,108
We reached our village... come!

492
00:30:41,853 --> 00:30:43,047
Let's go.

493
00:30:44,422 --> 00:30:47,084
Meenamma,
why did he pull the chain?

494
00:30:47,159 --> 00:30:50,651
When we arrive at my
village we pull the chain.

495
00:30:51,596 --> 00:30:54,121
Don't worry, it's very common.

496
00:30:54,766 --> 00:30:57,667
The station begins
from where we stand.

497
00:30:57,736 --> 00:30:58,760
Come on!

498
00:32:04,803 --> 00:32:06,634
Hey... move on!

499
00:33:02,394 --> 00:33:03,793
Who is this?

500
00:33:04,996 --> 00:33:06,122
Father.

501
00:33:41,032 --> 00:33:43,227
How many times will
you try to escape!

502
00:33:44,803 --> 00:33:47,772
Why are you doing this? Forwhat?

503
00:33:49,908 --> 00:33:50,704
I don't want to marry Tangaballi...

504
00:33:50,775 --> 00:33:53,266
Meena kept making her
father understand, emotionally.

505
00:33:54,045 --> 00:33:55,774
Herfather heard
whatMeena had to say.

506
00:33:55,847 --> 00:33:56,939
I am in love with somebody.

507
00:33:57,782 --> 00:33:58,510
Who is he?

508
00:33:58,583 --> 00:33:59,106
And I was...

509
00:33:59,250 --> 00:33:59,841
He.

510
00:33:59,918 --> 00:34:02,716
And I was as clueless
as you all are.

511
00:34:03,621 --> 00:34:05,555
He loves me too.

512
00:34:07,992 --> 00:34:09,016
Am I right?

513
00:34:09,961 --> 00:34:14,830
The plan was to just nod my head.
That is why...

514
00:34:18,103 --> 00:34:21,664
After such a reaction
one thing was certain.

515
00:34:21,973 --> 00:34:23,736
In the future, I wouldn't
be able to nod my head...

516
00:34:23,808 --> 00:34:26,299
because it would be cut off!

517
00:34:28,012 --> 00:34:29,912
My dear...

518
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:34,341
Is Tamil your mothertongue?

519
00:34:37,188 --> 00:34:39,816
What is yourfather
asking meabout my mother?

520
00:34:41,693 --> 00:34:44,161
He's asking youif Tamil
is your mothertongue?

521
00:34:46,631 --> 00:34:50,032
Appa, he settled in the North...

522
00:34:50,635 --> 00:34:53,297
I will teach him
Tamilafter our marriage.

523
00:34:53,371 --> 00:34:56,966
Meena likes this boy... bring him.

524
00:35:12,023 --> 00:35:15,424
Meenamma, I thought they
were going to kill me...

525
00:35:15,493 --> 00:35:17,688
but yourfathers goons
lifted me up on their shoulders.

526
00:35:17,762 --> 00:35:19,389
Passing the parcel.
Shoulderto shoulder.

527
00:35:19,464 --> 00:35:20,590
What did you say to them?

528
00:35:20,665 --> 00:35:22,064
I just told them three lies.

529
00:35:22,333 --> 00:35:22,890
You lied?

530
00:35:22,967 --> 00:35:24,798
At least tell me what you said?

531
00:35:24,869 --> 00:35:27,861
My first lie was that we are
very muchin love with each other.

532
00:35:27,939 --> 00:35:29,065
What?

533
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:32,002
My second lie was that we wanted
to get married to each other.

534
00:35:32,076 --> 00:35:33,407
What!

535
00:35:33,745 --> 00:35:35,542
That's when you nodded your head.

536
00:35:35,613 --> 00:35:37,843
Yes, I nodded. But that...

537
00:35:37,916 --> 00:35:39,645
So all of them have accepted this?

538
00:35:39,717 --> 00:35:40,684
No.

539
00:35:41,286 --> 00:35:44,016
The plan only worked
whenl told them the third lie.

540
00:35:44,088 --> 00:35:44,816
What was that?

541
00:35:44,956 --> 00:35:47,390
That you lived up north
since you were a child

542
00:35:47,459 --> 00:35:49,086
which is why you don't know tamil.

543
00:35:49,327 --> 00:35:51,454
He thought my story was genuine.

544
00:35:51,529 --> 00:35:54,794
So they've gone to the villageto
decide about ourfuture.

545
00:35:54,866 --> 00:35:57,357
Not to decide on the future
but to destroy my future.

546
00:35:57,435 --> 00:35:58,595
I am not going
to be a part of this.

547
00:35:58,670 --> 00:35:59,102
Hey brother...

548
00:35:59,337 --> 00:36:01,828
Think about it Rahul,
I will get married.

549
00:36:01,906 --> 00:36:03,100
But that is my problem!

550
00:36:03,341 --> 00:36:03,864
Go brother go.

551
00:36:03,942 --> 00:36:06,376
At first there were just
four of them running after you...

552
00:36:06,444 --> 00:36:08,503
now the whole village
will chase you.

553
00:36:09,647 --> 00:36:12,013
I did all this drama
so we could buy some time.

554
00:36:12,083 --> 00:36:14,517
We will run away as soon
as we get an opportunity at night.

555
00:36:14,586 --> 00:36:15,348
Run away...

556
00:36:15,887 --> 00:36:18,651
Don't worry, I have a lot
of experience in running away.

557
00:36:51,089 --> 00:36:52,488
My family.

558
00:37:01,232 --> 00:37:05,692
Meena's small family reminded
meof the population in China.

559
00:37:06,004 --> 00:37:08,734
Meena began telling them
the story of Chennai Express.

560
00:37:08,806 --> 00:37:12,640
As the story progressed everyone
seemed to be more impressed with me.

561
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:13,938
But I was depressed.

562
00:37:14,012 --> 00:37:15,172
My mind was stressed.

563
00:37:15,246 --> 00:37:20,946
The place where I had arrived
wasa very dangerous one!

564
00:37:27,125 --> 00:37:29,958
Everyone was treating me well.

565
00:37:30,028 --> 00:37:33,964
But a goat is also well
fed before it is sacrificed!

566
00:37:38,803 --> 00:37:41,033
98... 982136... 98213...

567
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:43,864
I've asked Bobby to geta
fancy number many times...

568
00:37:43,942 --> 00:37:44,636
but no, he'lljust be cheap.

569
00:37:44,709 --> 00:37:48,304
All the mobile service providersl
tried to contact were all

570
00:37:48,546 --> 00:37:51,276
to my brain...

571
00:37:51,916 --> 00:37:55,716
This mobile technology definitely connected
uswith our mothers and sisters but...

572
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:58,721
it had also messedwith our heads.

573
00:37:59,057 --> 00:38:00,046
At first when there
were no mobile phones...

574
00:38:00,124 --> 00:38:01,716
then we would remember
all telephone numbers.

575
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:04,961
Now that we have a mobile
phonewe don't remember any numbers!

576
00:38:05,563 --> 00:38:06,757
Meena...

577
00:38:07,298 --> 00:38:08,993
So when do we get out of here?

578
00:38:13,137 --> 00:38:14,968
Meena, don't ignore this please.

579
00:38:15,039 --> 00:38:17,564
This drama has gone on for
too long, it's quite enough now.

580
00:38:17,642 --> 00:38:18,768
- I'm losing patience. - Rahul.

581
00:38:20,345 --> 00:38:21,107
Hello sir.

582
00:38:22,246 --> 00:38:25,215
Coffee... I was asking...

583
00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:26,339
Coffee.

584
00:38:27,585 --> 00:38:28,609
Get him a coffee.

585
00:38:28,686 --> 00:38:29,653
- Thank you, sir. - Coffee.

586
00:38:57,582 --> 00:39:00,176
The food is ready, call everybody.

587
00:39:09,861 --> 00:39:11,453
Madhi, come here.

588
00:39:36,521 --> 00:39:37,852
Rahul.

589
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:40,379
Rahul.

590
00:40:06,417 --> 00:40:07,509
Oh no!

591
00:40:18,696 --> 00:40:19,663
Hello.

592
00:40:20,932 --> 00:40:22,456
Hey, you are so smart.

593
00:40:22,533 --> 00:40:24,558
What are you jabbering on in Tamil?
Talk in Hindi.

594
00:40:24,635 --> 00:40:26,728
Hey, you are very beautiful.

595
00:40:26,804 --> 00:40:30,501
Wow, you learnt Tamil
in a day? I love you so much.

596
00:40:32,643 --> 00:40:35,009
Hey... I am not this
sort of a guy... Please!

597
00:40:39,684 --> 00:40:39,945
Meena.

598
00:40:40,017 --> 00:40:40,506
Rahul.

599
00:40:40,585 --> 00:40:41,017
Madhi.

600
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:41,983
Puvi.

601
00:40:46,424 --> 00:40:47,618
They came.

602
00:40:47,725 --> 00:40:50,922
We just followed them.

603
00:40:51,028 --> 00:40:52,222
Yes...

604
00:40:52,663 --> 00:40:53,652
Let's go.

605
00:40:58,836 --> 00:41:02,169
You naughty...

606
00:41:04,609 --> 00:41:07,976
What's the hurry?

607
00:41:08,045 --> 00:41:11,014
You naughty!

608
00:41:13,518 --> 00:41:16,112
Meena I want to get out of here,
please do something.

609
00:41:16,888 --> 00:41:20,221
Do?? Naughty!!

610
00:41:20,458 --> 00:41:21,686
Not naughty.

611
00:41:29,834 --> 00:41:31,859
Doin fine? Vanakkam.

612
00:41:32,837 --> 00:41:33,667
Coffee?

613
00:41:34,172 --> 00:41:36,003
Oh man! Joking!

614
00:41:38,075 --> 00:41:39,565
Singh.

615
00:41:39,744 --> 00:41:41,268
We need to take a decisionin
some of these matters.

616
00:41:41,512 --> 00:41:43,275
A Punjabi? Here?

617
00:41:43,514 --> 00:41:46,506
We need to take a
decisionin some matter.

618
00:41:46,918 --> 00:41:48,215
So we should think
andtake a decision.

619
00:41:48,286 --> 00:41:49,514
You are right...

620
00:41:49,587 --> 00:41:51,680
but tell Meennamma that...

621
00:41:51,756 --> 00:41:53,189
This Punjabi man
is speaking in Tamil.

622
00:41:53,524 --> 00:41:54,923
With the boy she should not...

623
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,252
give me a minute...

624
00:42:03,134 --> 00:42:04,658
This is just great,
you're Rahul right?

625
00:42:04,735 --> 00:42:06,100
Yes, how did you know?

626
00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:09,662
It's the work of policemen,
to identify a corpse.

627
00:42:09,907 --> 00:42:11,135
A corpse? But I am still...

628
00:42:11,209 --> 00:42:13,177
If it's not been done
already, it will be done.

629
00:42:13,244 --> 00:42:16,702
Anyways, myself inspector
Samsherfrom Punjab.

630
00:42:16,781 --> 00:42:17,543
Okay, Sir.

631
00:42:17,615 --> 00:42:18,309
Which part?

632
00:42:18,549 --> 00:42:19,174
Which part?

633
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:20,911
The whole body my friend.

634
00:42:20,985 --> 00:42:23,783
I'm in charge of this area.

635
00:42:23,921 --> 00:42:26,754
You have a lot of guts.

636
00:42:26,824 --> 00:42:28,758
Fell in love with Meena...

637
00:42:28,826 --> 00:42:30,885
...knowing thatyou'll be
in the bad books of Tangaballi.

638
00:42:30,962 --> 00:42:33,658
Oh no, not at all.
People here have misunderstood.

639
00:42:33,798 --> 00:42:34,958
Actually these guys
want to frame me.

640
00:42:35,032 --> 00:42:37,557
You will be framed
up on this wall...

641
00:42:37,635 --> 00:42:39,603
and a garland will also
be placedon your photograph.

642
00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:41,865
Garland!
No sir. This is against the law.

643
00:42:41,939 --> 00:42:45,807
Here you go, you should have thought
about all this before falling in love!

644
00:42:49,747 --> 00:42:50,873
Tangaballi...

645
00:43:29,887 --> 00:43:33,983
I have heard that this time
somebody has come with Meena.

646
00:43:34,592 --> 00:43:36,150
Yes! What can we do?

647
00:43:37,795 --> 00:43:38,693
What is he saying?

648
00:43:38,763 --> 00:43:40,094
Tangaballi is asking about you.

649
00:43:40,231 --> 00:43:41,095
What is the father saying?

650
00:43:41,165 --> 00:43:42,564
The father is saying
youare the one because...

651
00:43:42,633 --> 00:43:44,066
of who Meena keeps running
away from home time and again.

652
00:43:44,135 --> 00:43:44,794
Oh not me!

653
00:43:44,869 --> 00:43:47,497
My marriage with
Meena was already fixed.

654
00:43:48,239 --> 00:43:49,797
You are right my dear...

655
00:43:50,641 --> 00:43:51,733
Now what is he saying?

656
00:43:51,809 --> 00:43:53,242
The father is saying
his first choice for Meena...

657
00:43:53,477 --> 00:43:54,705
...is Tangaballi but he is helpless.

658
00:43:54,779 --> 00:43:57,077
What can he do if Meena'sfirst
choice is you!?

659
00:43:57,148 --> 00:43:58,240
- No, no... No... - Yes!

660
00:43:58,582 --> 00:44:01,915
I am not here to decide
whatis right and wrong...

661
00:44:02,653 --> 00:44:04,280
it's a prestige issue.

662
00:44:04,989 --> 00:44:06,183
Sir, what is he saying now?

663
00:44:06,257 --> 00:44:07,588
The father is saying that...

664
00:44:07,658 --> 00:44:09,819
...to solve this matter nowthey will
all get together and take a decision.

665
00:44:09,894 --> 00:44:11,259
Not him, what is the giant saying?

666
00:44:11,495 --> 00:44:13,520
He's saying...

667
00:44:13,864 --> 00:44:15,832
Now it's not about
right orwrong...

668
00:44:16,067 --> 00:44:17,261
It's a matter of his prestige.

669
00:44:21,305 --> 00:44:22,932
If it's a matter of his prestige...

670
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:25,504
then why is he tryingto
take away mine?

671
00:44:25,576 --> 00:44:27,601
Sir, don't worry. I can handle this.

672
00:44:28,646 --> 00:44:29,704
Hi.

673
00:44:31,282 --> 00:44:33,614
Are you the one who
wantsto marry Meena?

674
00:44:35,086 --> 00:44:36,110
Yeah.

675
00:44:36,287 --> 00:44:37,914
At least hear him out...

676
00:44:39,590 --> 00:44:42,957
Who do you think you are? A hero?

677
00:44:43,861 --> 00:44:44,759
Yeah.

678
00:44:44,929 --> 00:44:46,726
Its okay, he is joking with me...

679
00:44:47,164 --> 00:44:50,190
If you are a real man,
fight with me!

680
00:44:50,868 --> 00:44:53,234
Natural! God's gift! Like you...

681
00:44:53,637 --> 00:44:55,161
We fight tonight...

682
00:44:55,306 --> 00:44:57,638
If you win, Meena is yours...

683
00:44:58,109 --> 00:45:00,976
If I win Meena is mine.

684
00:45:01,045 --> 00:45:02,945
What do you say?

685
00:45:03,147 --> 00:45:04,705
Yo Bro.

686
00:45:07,952 --> 00:45:09,146
He is so tall right!

687
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:10,812
What gibberish was he talking?

688
00:45:11,088 --> 00:45:12,715
I can't hear you - please
speak up. Don't be scared.

689
00:45:12,790 --> 00:45:14,724
He has challenged you.

690
00:45:14,792 --> 00:45:15,121
What?

691
00:45:15,192 --> 00:45:16,682
You and he will
have a fight tonight.

692
00:45:16,761 --> 00:45:17,591
Why?

693
00:45:17,661 --> 00:45:18,855
Whoeverwins, will get Meena.

694
00:45:18,929 --> 00:45:19,327
Why?

695
00:45:19,563 --> 00:45:21,690
My friend you have
justaccepted the challenge!!

696
00:45:21,766 --> 00:45:24,792
But I don't even understand Tamil,
I just nod my head.

697
00:45:26,037 --> 00:45:26,935
You came here alive.

698
00:45:27,004 --> 00:45:27,936
Okay.

699
00:45:28,272 --> 00:45:29,671
You will not leave here alive.

700
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:30,707
Never sir.

701
00:45:30,875 --> 00:45:34,709
I will cut you into several
pieces and parcel it.

702
00:45:45,656 --> 00:45:48,420
Tingu sir, that's what I'm saying, peace,
love, affection, friendship, Gandhi.

703
00:45:48,793 --> 00:45:50,158
Why didn't you tell me
what he was saying before?

704
00:45:50,394 --> 00:45:52,385
You were tickling me instead!

705
00:45:54,065 --> 00:45:54,724
Let's see.

706
00:45:54,799 --> 00:45:55,163
What?

707
00:45:55,399 --> 00:45:55,797
We will see.

708
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:57,496
We will see.

709
00:45:58,002 --> 00:46:00,596
Who is stronger.

710
00:46:01,038 --> 00:46:02,437
Who is stronger?

711
00:46:02,506 --> 00:46:03,803
What do you mean
who is stronger, sir?

712
00:46:03,874 --> 00:46:06,468
I am not at all strong.
Make them understand.

713
00:46:12,850 --> 00:46:14,044
Rahul!

714
00:46:15,953 --> 00:46:16,476
Sit.

715
00:46:16,554 --> 00:46:18,181
I know there's a little problem.

716
00:46:18,422 --> 00:46:19,548
A little problem?

717
00:46:19,623 --> 00:46:21,955
The fight has been fixed for
tonightwith that TVtower Tingu.

718
00:46:22,026 --> 00:46:24,654
And yourfather also wants to find out
who amongst the two of us is stronger...

719
00:46:24,728 --> 00:46:25,217
Strong?

720
00:46:25,463 --> 00:46:26,430
Yes, strong...

721
00:46:26,497 --> 00:46:27,691
Look Meenamma...

722
00:46:27,765 --> 00:46:29,062
if I get angry...

723
00:46:29,133 --> 00:46:30,191
Then what will you do Rahul?

724
00:46:30,434 --> 00:46:31,696
I will commit suicide.

725
00:46:31,769 --> 00:46:33,168
I will consume poison,
tie a noose around my neckand...

726
00:46:33,237 --> 00:46:34,499
...be run over by
the Chennai Express.

727
00:46:34,572 --> 00:46:34,936
No.

728
00:46:35,005 --> 00:46:36,495
The train is calling me.

729
00:46:36,574 --> 00:46:37,472
Rahul... Rahul!

730
00:46:37,541 --> 00:46:38,769
Don't panic.
- But he's so tall.

731
00:46:38,876 --> 00:46:40,036
I will make a plan
to run away tonight.

732
00:46:40,111 --> 00:46:41,578
He's very hairy and scary.

733
00:46:41,679 --> 00:46:42,976
Till then you remain normal.

734
00:46:43,047 --> 00:46:43,843
No I cannot remain normal.

735
00:46:43,914 --> 00:46:46,246
Normal Rahul

736
00:46:46,484 --> 00:46:47,849
- Normal! - Okay.

737
00:46:50,121 --> 00:46:52,112
I am normal.

738
00:46:52,823 --> 00:46:55,451
You place a time bomb inside
a personand ask them to be normal!

739
00:46:55,526 --> 00:46:56,925
Okay, I am normal. Hi, I am Normal.

740
00:46:56,994 --> 00:46:58,052
You must have heard
that name before.

741
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:03,459
Meenamma!
- Yes.

742
00:47:03,534 --> 00:47:04,694
So many people.

743
00:47:04,768 --> 00:47:06,759
They are preparingfor
yourfight with Tangaballi.

744
00:47:06,837 --> 00:47:09,499
I know... but how are we goingto get
away with so many people around?

745
00:47:09,573 --> 00:47:10,232
Don't worry.

746
00:47:10,474 --> 00:47:11,702
My escape plan is ready.

747
00:47:11,775 --> 00:47:12,935
It's ready? What is it?

748
00:47:13,010 --> 00:47:15,501
You just go out and behave normal.

749
00:47:15,579 --> 00:47:17,103
- I am normal. - Normal.

750
00:47:17,181 --> 00:47:19,240
I will come in a
while and signal to you.

751
00:47:19,483 --> 00:47:19,915
Okay.

752
00:47:19,984 --> 00:47:21,713
Then the two of us will run away.

753
00:47:21,785 --> 00:47:24,754
Till then you don't
make any mistakes.

754
00:47:31,061 --> 00:47:32,926
No mistakes.

755
00:47:42,039 --> 00:47:43,597
I am normal.

756
00:47:45,776 --> 00:47:47,209
No mistakes.

757
00:48:08,966 --> 00:48:11,935
Dude, where are you going?

758
00:48:12,002 --> 00:48:14,698
You are the one for me.

759
00:48:14,772 --> 00:48:17,502
Come and hug me

760
00:48:17,575 --> 00:48:19,668
My body craves for you

761
00:48:19,743 --> 00:48:22,803
Hey I don't know Tamil.

762
00:48:23,113 --> 00:48:24,102
Okay, should I sing in Hindi?

763
00:48:24,181 --> 00:48:25,239
Just a second...

764
00:48:30,487 --> 00:48:32,751
My exotic beauty

765
00:48:32,823 --> 00:48:35,587
I have veiled it

766
00:48:35,793 --> 00:48:40,890
And brought it for
you, hidden it from the world

767
00:48:41,065 --> 00:48:43,966
I am stuck between
the deviland the deep sea

768
00:48:44,034 --> 00:48:46,662
Will someone tell me what to do?

769
00:48:46,737 --> 00:48:48,864
I wonderwho has cursed me

770
00:48:48,939 --> 00:48:51,874
How have I landed
here - in this situation?

771
00:48:51,942 --> 00:48:54,809
Don't worry, be happy

772
00:48:54,878 --> 00:48:57,506
Come and groove on the beat

Dappan goothu hard
coreLet's dance hard core

817
00:51:29,066 --> 00:51:30,693
Move your shoulders up and down

818
00:51:30,768 --> 00:51:31,757
Move your body all around

819
00:51:31,835 --> 00:51:34,804
Give me... give me... give megive
me... give me... give me spme more

820
00:51:38,709 --> 00:51:42,509
Meena Lochini Azzadddddha Sundaram.

821
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:48,640
Meena Lochini Azzadddddha Sundaram.

822
00:51:48,852 --> 00:51:51,616
Addresses are shorter
than this name!

823
00:51:51,855 --> 00:51:55,086
I had gone on a holiday, and
you took me on a trip!

824
00:51:56,093 --> 00:51:59,119
No, I won't nod my head now.

825
00:51:59,363 --> 00:52:00,022
Nope!

826
00:52:00,464 --> 00:52:02,056
Hey pot King!

827
00:52:02,132 --> 00:52:04,930
Why are you sitting on
that bike and staring at me?

828
00:52:05,669 --> 00:52:09,503
I had full plans of having fun,
because of your ashes...

829
00:52:09,573 --> 00:52:11,370
I've gotten into so much trouble.

830
00:52:11,975 --> 00:52:17,504
Grandpa, I had full plans to immerse
your ashesin the waters of Goa but...

831
00:52:17,581 --> 00:52:19,879
you changed my entire plan!

832
00:52:19,950 --> 00:52:22,817
Why? Y. Y. Mithaiwala?

833
00:52:23,554 --> 00:52:25,749
Hey brother...

834
00:52:26,390 --> 00:52:27,914
Hold this!

835
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:34,722
You were scaring me by
showing me your gun, weren't you?

836
00:52:34,998 --> 00:52:37,933
Now I will also showyou
something. Look!

837
00:52:41,605 --> 00:52:44,005
Saw that? Can you do that?

838
00:52:44,208 --> 00:52:46,039
No right?

839
00:52:46,410 --> 00:52:50,938
That's because yourthree
Michellin tyres come in between

840
00:52:52,816 --> 00:52:55,410
Fatty.

841
00:52:56,153 --> 00:52:59,020
Hey Don!

842
00:52:59,990 --> 00:53:03,118
You threaten me?

843
00:53:03,193 --> 00:53:04,217
Wait.

844
00:53:10,767 --> 00:53:13,531
Can you do this?

845
00:53:14,271 --> 00:53:16,171
No right? So then?

846
00:53:16,974 --> 00:53:19,602
Boss!

847
00:53:20,110 --> 00:53:23,511
Mr. Durgeshwara
Azzadddddha Sundaram.

848
00:53:23,580 --> 00:53:24,945
Tamil is not my mothertongue!

849
00:53:25,015 --> 00:53:26,949
Enamma Kanne?

850
00:53:27,017 --> 00:53:28,848
You have become a referee?

851
00:53:28,919 --> 00:53:31,615
You fixed a match
betweenTingu and me.

852
00:53:31,688 --> 00:53:34,122
Where's Tingu, where's...
bring Tingu.

853
00:53:35,225 --> 00:53:37,785
Tingu.

854
00:53:42,766 --> 00:53:44,961
Hey you black cloth
hanging on a hanger!

855
00:53:47,104 --> 00:53:49,299
Will you fight with me? Why?

856
00:53:50,207 --> 00:53:53,973
You are so tall and I'm so small.

857
00:53:55,846 --> 00:53:57,973
Okay you can fight...

858
00:53:58,048 --> 00:54:00,278
but before that show
me if you can do this?

859
00:54:03,220 --> 00:54:06,747
Tingu look... Can you do this?

860
00:54:26,877 --> 00:54:28,242
Catch him.

861
00:54:44,394 --> 00:54:46,885
Tangaballi, can you do this?

862
00:54:46,964 --> 00:54:48,431
- Hey Sir! - Rahul.

863
00:54:48,498 --> 00:54:49,487
What has happened?

864
00:54:49,566 --> 00:54:51,625
You and me will
have some buttermilk!

865
00:54:51,702 --> 00:54:53,795
I will have some
buttermilk, come on get up!

866
00:54:53,904 --> 00:54:54,768
Come on get up!

867
00:54:54,838 --> 00:54:55,463
Okay, sir.

868
00:54:55,539 --> 00:54:57,734
Oh! You are completely drunk.

869
00:54:57,975 --> 00:54:59,636
Careful!

870
00:55:00,344 --> 00:55:01,402
Come.

871
00:55:02,412 --> 00:55:04,004
Hey don't fall again!

872
00:55:04,448 --> 00:55:06,416
Careful!

873
00:55:06,483 --> 00:55:07,950
Come here sit.

874
00:55:08,418 --> 00:55:09,646
Sit, listen...

875
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:11,581
The station is
on the opposite side.

876
00:55:11,655 --> 00:55:13,987
Tomorrow morning at 5:30 you
need to leaveby the first train.

877
00:55:14,057 --> 00:55:14,887
Understood?

878
00:55:14,958 --> 00:55:18,450
And don't tell anyone
that I helped you.

879
00:55:18,528 --> 00:55:19,051
It's a secret.

880
00:55:19,296 --> 00:55:20,627
Yes and let it remain a secret.

881
00:55:20,697 --> 00:55:22,494
Else, the entire village
will cut me into pieces.

882
00:55:22,566 --> 00:55:23,294
Okay?

883
00:55:23,367 --> 00:55:25,801
The rest, the Almighty will
take care of. Now, go to sleep.

884
00:55:40,384 --> 00:55:44,718
Oh my God! Earthquake!

885
00:55:45,489 --> 00:55:46,820
Sir!

886
00:56:11,148 --> 00:56:12,706
Life of Pi?

887
00:56:16,153 --> 00:56:17,484
Hey! Look!

888
00:56:18,488 --> 00:56:20,353
How did you come here?

889
00:56:20,424 --> 00:56:21,118
From where have you come?

890
00:56:21,491 --> 00:56:22,458
Where is this boat going?

891
00:56:22,526 --> 00:56:23,117
Sri Lanka.

892
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:24,884
Sri Lanka! Why?

893
00:56:24,961 --> 00:56:26,155
To get diesel.

894
00:56:26,396 --> 00:56:28,887
Have you gone mad? Why are you
going to Sri Lanka to get diesel?

895
00:56:30,901 --> 00:56:33,563
We're going to Sri
Lanka to smuggle diesel.

896
00:56:33,770 --> 00:56:35,670
Smuggling! But that is illegal.

897
00:56:35,739 --> 00:56:37,468
Everything is fair
when one has to survive.

898
00:56:37,541 --> 00:56:39,065
If the Sri Lanka Marine
police catch us, we will be jailed.

899
00:56:39,142 --> 00:56:41,372
If the Indian Marine police
catch us, we will be jailed here.

900
00:56:41,445 --> 00:56:44,778
If police don't
catch us, all is well.

901
00:56:44,848 --> 00:56:47,009
Oil is well!!

902
00:56:53,156 --> 00:56:55,454
Help me, I've gotten
on to the wrong boat.

903
00:56:56,860 --> 00:56:59,988
Bring out the gun. Get me the gun.

904
00:57:00,464 --> 00:57:01,123
Gun!

905
00:57:01,198 --> 00:57:02,130
Why are you taking out a gun?

906
00:57:02,199 --> 00:57:04,599
This is illegal. Don't do that!

907
00:57:31,194 --> 00:57:32,320
Very good, sir, well done, sir.

908
00:57:32,562 --> 00:57:34,621
Catch them and arrest them.

909
00:57:34,765 --> 00:57:37,859
You're the first smugglerwho
isso happy about being arrested.

910
00:57:37,934 --> 00:57:38,866
No, sir.

911
00:57:38,935 --> 00:57:39,663
I'm not a smuggler.

912
00:57:39,736 --> 00:57:41,067
Smuggler and me? I
am not with them, sir.

913
00:57:41,138 --> 00:57:42,070
I am an Indian, sir.

914
00:57:42,139 --> 00:57:44,300
Okay. Then show me your passport!

915
00:57:44,908 --> 00:57:46,034
Passport! Why, sir?

916
00:57:46,109 --> 00:57:48,634
To verify whether you
are an Indian or Sri Lankan.

917
00:57:48,712 --> 00:57:50,111
These are international waters.

918
00:57:50,180 --> 00:57:51,169
International waters!

919
00:57:51,248 --> 00:57:52,715
But sir, I am not with them.

920
00:57:52,783 --> 00:57:54,842
I talk in Hindi, sir, Hindi!!

921
00:57:54,918 --> 00:57:56,613
We can also talk in Hindi.

922
00:57:57,087 --> 00:57:59,317
Listen in Hindi!

923
00:57:59,623 --> 00:58:00,555
What?

924
00:58:00,624 --> 00:58:01,852
We all speak in Hindi!

925
00:58:01,925 --> 00:58:03,153
Sir, he's one of our men.

926
00:58:03,226 --> 00:58:04,284
And you are my woman!

927
00:58:04,361 --> 00:58:05,089
What?

928
00:58:05,162 --> 00:58:07,960
Shut up.

929
00:58:09,166 --> 00:58:10,929
What are you looking at? Arrest him.

930
00:58:11,001 --> 00:58:11,968
What does that mean?

931
00:58:14,371 --> 00:58:17,670
They say if you suffix word,
Ji, (Yes)to any otherword...

932
00:58:17,741 --> 00:58:18,935
you gain respect.

933
00:58:19,176 --> 00:58:21,110
Refu... Ji.

934
00:58:21,178 --> 00:58:22,839
I did not gain anything!

935
00:58:23,213 --> 00:58:26,944
Here my fate was being written
by my grandpa sitting in heavens...

936
00:58:27,184 --> 00:58:30,745
whereas Meena's fatewas
being written by herfather.

937
00:58:31,087 --> 00:58:34,750
He decided to get hermarried
off to Tangaballi.

938
00:58:35,225 --> 00:58:37,955
Meena was neither happy
with it norwas it her choice.

939
00:58:39,129 --> 00:58:41,962
Who would have thought
that the tip of India...

940
00:58:42,032 --> 00:58:46,401
would begin a new chapter
in Meena's and my life.

941
00:59:07,791 --> 00:59:11,192
Brother, what are you
looking at with such fear?

942
00:59:11,261 --> 00:59:12,057
Is this yours?

943
00:59:12,128 --> 00:59:12,719
Yes.

944
00:59:12,796 --> 00:59:14,388
I'm sure there is RDX in this.

945
00:59:14,631 --> 00:59:16,622
He is... no he was!

946
00:59:16,700 --> 00:59:17,860
I mean it was!

947
00:59:17,934 --> 00:59:18,958
My grandfather is in it...

948
00:59:19,035 --> 00:59:20,627
I mean my grandfather's
ashes are in that...

949
00:59:20,704 --> 00:59:21,170
Allow me to show you.

950
00:59:21,238 --> 00:59:23,297
Don't move.

951
00:59:23,373 --> 00:59:24,772
Okay, Sir...

952
00:59:24,841 --> 00:59:26,832
I have been telling you thatl
am not a smuggler, haven't I?

953
00:59:26,910 --> 00:59:28,070
I'm an Indian.

954
00:59:28,144 --> 00:59:30,704
My name is Rahul
and I'm not a terrorist.

955
00:59:34,084 --> 00:59:38,418
You know, sir I came from Mumbai to
immerse my grandfather's ashes, that's all.

956
00:59:39,055 --> 00:59:40,989
I told the police
everything truthfully.

957
00:59:41,057 --> 00:59:43,025
My history.
The geography of my travel.

958
00:59:43,093 --> 00:59:45,618
And my chemistry with
the people of Komban.

959
00:59:45,695 --> 00:59:49,062
After hearing all this, allthe
Marine police officer said was...

960
00:59:49,132 --> 00:59:51,464
So, the people of
Komban know you, right?

961
01:00:33,410 --> 01:00:34,240
Hello sir!

962
01:00:34,311 --> 01:00:35,300
Hello, dummy.

963
01:00:35,378 --> 01:00:36,538
So nice to see you...

964
01:00:36,613 --> 01:00:38,308
yourfellow brothers
are droppingme to Mumbai.

965
01:00:38,381 --> 01:00:39,370
Give me a hug!

966
01:00:39,983 --> 01:00:42,451
You left me right?

967
01:00:42,519 --> 01:00:44,714
Because of some smugglers
I went away to Sri Lanka.

968
01:00:44,788 --> 01:00:45,652
You didn't go away.
You came back...

969
01:00:45,722 --> 01:00:46,780
to Komban.

970
01:00:46,856 --> 01:00:48,346
How can that happen?

971
01:00:48,425 --> 01:00:49,858
Look...

972
01:00:58,001 --> 01:00:59,866
Look there...

973
01:01:00,337 --> 01:01:00,701
All the best.

974
01:01:00,770 --> 01:01:01,532
Brother, me too.

975
01:01:01,604 --> 01:01:02,832
Catch him.

976
01:01:02,939 --> 01:01:03,963
What are you doing, man?

977
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:05,064
Please.

978
01:01:05,709 --> 01:01:09,338
Sir, please leave
me for heaven's sake!

979
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:11,008
Namaste, sir.

980
01:01:11,581 --> 01:01:12,775
Namaste.

981
01:01:13,717 --> 01:01:14,775
Do you know him?

982
01:01:15,552 --> 01:01:17,076
Know him?

983
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:20,721
We know him.

984
01:01:21,324 --> 01:01:21,813
Periya.

985
01:01:21,891 --> 01:01:22,687
Yes.

986
01:01:22,759 --> 01:01:24,351
He is ourfamily member, isn't it?

987
01:01:24,427 --> 01:01:27,487
Yes, he is one of us.

988
01:01:27,564 --> 01:01:29,657
Hey, where had you disappeared?

989
01:01:29,966 --> 01:01:33,333
There's such tension
since you went missing.

990
01:01:33,403 --> 01:01:35,598
Oh family!!
So you are an Indian after all.

991
01:01:35,672 --> 01:01:37,572
I will release you here and leave.

992
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:39,733
Officer,
you cannot leave me here and go.

993
01:01:39,809 --> 01:01:40,798
I am Sri lankan.

994
01:01:40,877 --> 01:01:43,539
I am Sri... Devi

995
01:01:47,384 --> 01:01:49,011
Ennama kannu...

996
01:01:49,552 --> 01:01:50,519
referee?

997
01:01:50,587 --> 01:01:52,487
No, sir I meant, Periyathale sir...

998
01:01:52,555 --> 01:01:54,614
What... hanger?

999
01:01:54,691 --> 01:01:55,817
I meant strong sir.

1000
01:01:55,892 --> 01:01:57,086
Michellin Tyre?

1001
01:01:57,327 --> 01:01:57,884
No, sir.

1002
01:01:57,961 --> 01:01:59,053
Chewing gum, huh?

1003
01:01:59,129 --> 01:02:00,926
Sweet, sir. I mean sweet.

1004
01:02:04,667 --> 01:02:06,396
Do not step forward. I
am warning you.

1005
01:02:06,469 --> 01:02:07,766
I will cut all bonds of friendship.

1006
01:02:08,671 --> 01:02:10,036
Hold this.

1007
01:02:10,907 --> 01:02:12,704
Nobody come forward.

1008
01:02:12,776 --> 01:02:16,405
If anybody comes forward, I will...

1009
01:02:16,479 --> 01:02:18,413
cut myself.

1010
01:02:18,481 --> 01:02:19,470
Okay, cut yourself.

1011
01:02:20,817 --> 01:02:21,977
Cut yourself.

1012
01:02:22,385 --> 01:02:24,410
I will cut Meenamma.

1013
01:02:44,707 --> 01:02:45,696
Stop.

1014
01:02:47,911 --> 01:02:49,503
I will cut Meenamma.

1015
01:02:52,582 --> 01:02:54,880
Meenamma, open the door.

1016
01:02:56,686 --> 01:02:57,778
Don't move any of you!

1017
01:03:02,759 --> 01:03:03,817
Move!

1018
01:03:06,162 --> 01:03:07,720
What do I do?

1019
01:03:07,797 --> 01:03:12,996
Sorry, Tingu sir. Sorry.

1020
01:03:13,870 --> 01:03:15,201
Catch him.

1021
01:04:06,689 --> 01:04:07,917
Come on, get out.

1022
01:04:07,991 --> 01:04:08,753
What?

1023
01:04:09,392 --> 01:04:11,724
First you get drunk and
run away all by yourself.

1024
01:04:11,794 --> 01:04:14,422
Then you get into
troubleand use me to...

1025
01:04:14,497 --> 01:04:15,464
get out of it and then
you say get outof the car.

1026
01:04:15,532 --> 01:04:16,829
Yes that's what I said.
Get out please.

1027
01:04:16,900 --> 01:04:17,764
I won't get out.

1028
01:04:17,834 --> 01:04:18,823
This car belongs to my father.

1029
01:04:18,902 --> 01:04:20,563
If you don't get out,
I will take you back there.

1030
01:04:20,637 --> 01:04:21,865
Then from Miss you will become Mrs.

1031
01:04:21,938 --> 01:04:24,532
Before that, from Rahul
you will become Late Rahul.

1032
01:04:24,974 --> 01:04:27,465
No! I mean, I don't think
there'sany parking here, lets go.

1033
01:06:32,835 --> 01:06:34,803
What happened?
Has the vehicle broken down?

1034
01:06:35,738 --> 01:06:37,433
No, who told you that?

1035
01:06:39,075 --> 01:06:39,837
What is with the smoke, then?

1036
01:06:39,976 --> 01:06:40,738
Smoke?

1037
01:06:40,810 --> 01:06:42,368
The car is smoking a cigarette.

1038
01:06:42,445 --> 01:06:43,673
And do you know why I came outside?

1039
01:06:43,780 --> 01:06:44,576
I thought to myself, that...

1040
01:06:44,647 --> 01:06:46,774
...I could wait andrelax
here and Tangaballi would come by.

1041
01:06:46,849 --> 01:06:49,943
And, when he does come,
the threeof us can play together.

1042
01:06:50,520 --> 01:06:51,544
Can't you see?

1043
01:06:52,021 --> 01:06:54,182
Yourfather's car is
even worse than your Hindi.

1044
01:06:54,424 --> 01:06:55,550
You have wrecked the car!

1045
01:06:55,625 --> 01:06:57,525
Don't call this a car, it'd
be a sin to call this a car.

1046
01:06:57,593 --> 01:06:59,026
This car has saved your life.

1047
01:06:59,095 --> 01:07:01,120
It's not a car, it's a wreck!

1048
01:07:03,032 --> 01:07:04,556
My father's favorite car!

1049
01:07:05,902 --> 01:07:06,926
Go...

1050
01:07:11,207 --> 01:07:13,607
Catch it, Rahul...

1051
01:07:14,777 --> 01:07:16,904
Catch it,
Rahul. What are you... run.

1052
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:19,913
It's Appa's favorite car,
Rahul. Catch.

1053
01:07:28,624 --> 01:07:30,182
Oh no!

1054
01:07:42,839 --> 01:07:43,601
Here you go...

1055
01:07:44,173 --> 01:07:46,198
Here, Meenamma baby.

1056
01:07:46,442 --> 01:07:48,137
Yourfather's favorite car.

1057
01:07:48,211 --> 01:07:50,645
Actually the problem wasn't yourfather's,
neitherwas it his wrecked car...

1058
01:07:50,713 --> 01:07:51,737
the problem is yours.

1059
01:07:51,814 --> 01:07:54,783
You see wherever you go, you carry
a free trouble pack along with you.

1060
01:07:54,851 --> 01:07:55,180
Bad luck!

1061
01:07:55,251 --> 01:07:56,513
Actually you are like a black cat.

1062
01:07:57,553 --> 01:07:58,781
Worse than a black cat!

1063
01:07:58,855 --> 01:08:02,018
If you cross the path of the black
cat, the black catwill get cursed.

1064
01:08:02,592 --> 01:08:03,581
Then why are you with me?

1065
01:08:03,659 --> 01:08:04,648
Why am I with you?

1066
01:08:04,727 --> 01:08:06,058
Why are you with me?

1067
01:08:06,129 --> 01:08:08,154
Please, Meenamma. Stop stalking me.

1068
01:08:08,231 --> 01:08:11,064
From now on. I will go my way,
you go yourway!

1069
01:08:11,134 --> 01:08:11,998
Alright.

1070
01:08:12,068 --> 01:08:13,092
Fine by me.

1071
01:08:13,169 --> 01:08:15,933
But by the way. You stole the car
and drove in the wrong direction.

1072
01:08:16,005 --> 01:08:17,905
Now we have only one way out.

1073
01:08:17,974 --> 01:08:20,204
You will have to cross
Komban again! Komban!

1074
01:08:20,276 --> 01:08:21,607
Don't scare me with Komban.

1075
01:08:21,677 --> 01:08:24,612
If you are not with me,
I will manage on my own, like this!

1076
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:25,044
Lmpossible.

1077
01:08:25,114 --> 01:08:28,083
There's no word called
impossiblein my dictionary.

1078
01:08:28,151 --> 01:08:31,177
Really? From where did
you buy sucha rubbish dictionary?

1079
01:08:33,055 --> 01:08:35,683
Don't underestimate
the power of a common man.

1080
01:08:37,894 --> 01:08:38,826
Get lost.

1081
01:08:47,804 --> 01:08:51,570
I thought I would never
meet Meenamma ever again...

1082
01:08:52,008 --> 01:08:54,670
but fate had decreed
something else altogether.

1083
01:10:02,412 --> 01:10:03,811
Hello, sir.

1084
01:10:04,547 --> 01:10:06,879
I need to find the road.

1085
01:10:07,250 --> 01:10:10,947
Where... is... the highway?

1086
01:10:12,389 --> 01:10:13,481
Okay.

1087
01:10:18,561 --> 01:10:20,085
Why are you doing that?

1088
01:10:20,830 --> 01:10:23,526
I want to see the road.

1089
01:10:26,202 --> 01:10:28,136
Where is the highway?

1090
01:10:28,638 --> 01:10:30,503
Where is the highway?

1091
01:10:38,181 --> 01:10:39,205
Okay.

1092
01:10:39,549 --> 01:10:41,016
Meaning.

1093
01:10:41,351 --> 01:10:42,409
Meaning!

1094
01:10:49,659 --> 01:10:52,127
My child, quiet.

1095
01:10:53,129 --> 01:10:55,256
Don't take so much
trouble. I feel bad, then.

1096
01:10:57,534 --> 01:10:59,365
The two of us have
the same problem.

1097
01:10:59,436 --> 01:11:01,461
At this age there is
no need for a new language.

1098
01:11:01,638 --> 01:11:03,606
Okay.

1099
01:11:05,341 --> 01:11:07,070
Okay.

1100
01:11:30,934 --> 01:11:32,299
Excuse me brother.

1101
01:11:35,238 --> 01:11:37,263
Brother, stop.

1102
01:11:39,509 --> 01:11:41,443
Brother, hello

1103
01:11:41,511 --> 01:11:43,206
What do you want? What
is yourwork here?

1104
01:11:43,279 --> 01:11:45,076
I'm not Angelina Jolie.

1105
01:11:45,148 --> 01:11:47,480
I'm a boy, Rahul. I need a lift!

1106
01:11:48,318 --> 01:11:49,910
You're from Mumbai right?

1107
01:11:49,986 --> 01:11:52,045
How do you know so much about me?

1108
01:11:52,122 --> 01:11:54,090
The entire South knows you.

1109
01:11:54,157 --> 01:11:58,617
One fair boy has eloped with Durgeshwara
Azagsundaram's daughter in a car.

1110
01:11:58,695 --> 01:12:01,255
Oh no, what have you done!

1111
01:12:01,331 --> 01:12:03,492
Today you are in a cartomorrow you
will bethe headline of a newspaper.

1112
01:12:03,566 --> 01:12:04,999
No, listen to me.

1113
01:12:05,301 --> 01:12:08,429
You don't know, the village
people are chasing you with sticks!

1114
01:12:08,505 --> 01:12:10,439
Once you're caught...

1115
01:12:10,507 --> 01:12:13,442
...they will separate your head from
your body and put that as a headline!

1116
01:12:13,510 --> 01:12:15,944
Let it be... Is it their kingdom?

1117
01:12:16,012 --> 01:12:19,448
The girl you have eloped with,
this is herfather's kingdom!

1118
01:12:19,516 --> 01:12:20,676
Brother, please help me.

1119
01:12:20,750 --> 01:12:22,547
Go away.

1120
01:12:24,287 --> 01:12:25,481
Brother help me.

1121
01:12:25,655 --> 01:12:27,316
I am Angelina Jolie!

1122
01:12:28,324 --> 01:12:29,348
Brother!

1123
01:12:32,462 --> 01:12:36,990
I became numb after hearing this...

1124
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:39,363
I could see the road ahead...

1125
01:12:40,170 --> 01:12:42,468
But there was no way out.

1126
01:12:43,339 --> 01:12:45,466
Except one.

1127
01:12:45,775 --> 01:12:49,609
Meenamma...

1128
01:12:51,014 --> 01:12:53,005
Meenamma...

1129
01:12:53,082 --> 01:12:55,073
Meenamma...

1130
01:12:55,151 --> 01:12:56,675
Meenamma...

1131
01:13:00,423 --> 01:13:00,980
What is it?

1132
01:13:01,057 --> 01:13:02,524
What?

1133
01:13:02,992 --> 01:13:04,857
You've come back to me after all?

1134
01:13:05,895 --> 01:13:08,864
Figured it out, didn't
you? How does it feel to be alone?

1135
01:13:08,932 --> 01:13:10,092
Look at yourface.

1136
01:13:10,166 --> 01:13:13,158
It seems like you are getting a fever
because you are so frightened.

1137
01:13:13,469 --> 01:13:15,562
Come on now, I've come to take you.

1138
01:13:16,039 --> 01:13:18,405
We will go together. Come! Come!

1139
01:13:20,310 --> 01:13:22,437
Again you've taken the wrong route.

1140
01:13:22,512 --> 01:13:24,980
This is the safer route,
that side you will find Tangaballi.

1141
01:13:25,048 --> 01:13:26,413
Come on!

1142
01:13:27,250 --> 01:13:29,514
Listen, I can save you.

1143
01:13:29,586 --> 01:13:32,987
Listen don't underestimate
the power of a common man!

1144
01:14:14,030 --> 01:14:15,361
Vidamba village.

1145
01:14:16,266 --> 01:14:17,392
Come on.

1146
01:14:31,014 --> 01:14:33,107
Awedding ceremony
is going on here.

1147
01:14:33,182 --> 01:14:35,150
We will roam around
here and speak to people.

1148
01:14:35,485 --> 01:14:37,476
We can stay here for a few days...

1149
01:14:37,820 --> 01:14:40,880
till then father and Tangaballi's
tension will get a bit diffused...

1150
01:14:40,957 --> 01:14:43,391
Then why are you standing
hereand talking Ms. Subtitle.

1151
01:14:43,459 --> 01:14:44,983
Go, go ahead and talk to people.

1152
01:14:46,496 --> 01:14:47,793
So much style!!

1153
01:14:47,864 --> 01:14:49,058
Why don't you go and talk?

1154
01:14:49,132 --> 01:14:50,121
I can talk.

1155
01:14:50,199 --> 01:14:51,894
This 'Kunjam kunjam'... what?

1156
01:14:51,968 --> 01:14:53,993
Apadiya sapadiya po.

1157
01:14:54,804 --> 01:14:56,863
Your grandfather can
go take a hike! (ln Marathi)

1158
01:14:57,307 --> 01:14:58,934
You speak in Marathi too?

1159
01:14:59,008 --> 01:15:01,909
Why? If you can speak in Tamil,
why can'tl speak in Marathi?

1160
01:15:01,978 --> 01:15:05,175
Oh mother! Meenamma.
For now just go and talk in Tamil.

1161
01:15:05,248 --> 01:15:07,341
Ready steady go!

1162
01:15:12,488 --> 01:15:21,556
It seemed very pleasant. As
though nothing could go wrong.

1163
01:15:30,940 --> 01:15:33,568
Once bitten, twice shy...

1164
01:15:33,810 --> 01:15:37,371
that's why this time I did
not nod in agreement to anything!

1165
01:15:46,389 --> 01:15:50,985
The second time when
the villagers looked at me...

1166
01:15:55,098 --> 01:15:56,531
Now what happened?

1167
01:15:57,967 --> 01:16:00,492
Hey hey,
don't come in front of me...

1168
01:16:22,258 --> 01:16:24,783
Open the window.
Let the fresh air in.

1169
01:16:25,361 --> 01:16:28,057
Here is the towel and some clothes.

1170
01:16:28,131 --> 01:16:30,065
Rest well.

1171
01:16:30,133 --> 01:16:34,194
In the morning, after your
bath, we will arrange the prayers.

1172
01:16:34,737 --> 01:16:38,503
Rest well.
Take care of him. Bye. -Thanks.

1173
01:16:39,409 --> 01:16:41,843
You know,
a film should be made on me.

1174
01:16:41,911 --> 01:16:43,378
I laugh my way into a mess.

1175
01:16:43,446 --> 01:16:45,107
Whenever people are willing to gladly
lift me upon their shoulders...

1176
01:16:45,181 --> 01:16:46,773
...I know I am in a trouble.

1177
01:16:46,849 --> 01:16:48,077
And you, Meenamma...

1178
01:16:50,053 --> 01:16:51,486
what are the lies you
have spun around this time?

1179
01:16:52,255 --> 01:16:54,951
I told them we got
married and ran away.

1180
01:16:55,024 --> 01:16:59,256
Have you copyrighted this story of
getting married and running away?

1181
01:17:03,099 --> 01:17:04,031
Then what did you say?

1182
01:17:06,069 --> 01:17:08,037
The second lie that
I told them was that...

1183
01:17:08,104 --> 01:17:11,232
...you are so good that
you will never leave me and go.

1184
01:17:11,307 --> 01:17:12,069
Never!

1185
01:17:12,141 --> 01:17:16,544
You only said that
you wouldn't leave me.

1186
01:17:16,779 --> 01:17:17,803
Yes.

1187
01:17:17,880 --> 01:17:25,810
Then I said you got so tired with
the journey that you felt faint.

1188
01:17:25,888 --> 01:17:28,550
That's why...

1189
01:17:30,326 --> 01:17:31,953
Head!!

1190
01:17:32,595 --> 01:17:34,290
That's why I'm getting
this special treatment.

1191
01:17:34,363 --> 01:17:35,227
No.

1192
01:17:35,298 --> 01:17:36,993
The special treatment
is becausel told them...

1193
01:17:37,066 --> 01:17:40,194
the reason why we eloped is
becausemy father has a huge problem...

1194
01:17:40,269 --> 01:17:42,999
with you being poor
and me being rich.

1195
01:17:43,072 --> 01:17:43,902
Yeah.

1196
01:17:43,973 --> 01:17:45,497
I am very rich.

1197
01:17:45,575 --> 01:17:46,439
Of course.

1198
01:17:46,509 --> 01:17:49,273
And you are a Sweet Seller.

1199
01:17:52,081 --> 01:17:54,914
How did you knowl
was a Sweet Seller?

1200
01:17:55,084 --> 01:17:55,880
What?

1201
01:17:57,053 --> 01:17:59,886
You are a Sweet Seller?

1202
01:18:03,159 --> 01:18:04,057
No.

1203
01:18:04,594 --> 01:18:05,561
Say.

1204
01:18:08,464 --> 01:18:09,362
Yes.

1205
01:18:10,299 --> 01:18:11,459
I am a Sweet Seller.

1206
01:18:13,102 --> 01:18:15,536
What is so funny about that?

1207
01:18:16,372 --> 01:18:17,896
A Sweet Seller is
betterthanbeing a Don.

1208
01:18:17,974 --> 01:18:18,565
You understand?

1209
01:18:18,641 --> 01:18:19,972
Quiet.

1210
01:18:24,380 --> 01:18:25,369
Okay...

1211
01:18:25,448 --> 01:18:26,176
Very funny.

1212
01:18:26,249 --> 01:18:28,581
That means my third
lieis actually the truth.

1213
01:18:29,252 --> 01:18:30,082
Very funny.

1214
01:18:30,153 --> 01:18:31,177
You are making fun of me now?

1215
01:18:31,254 --> 01:18:33,051
Earlier,
yourfather madea fool out of me.

1216
01:18:33,289 --> 01:18:34,916
What a great father
daughter combination.

1217
01:18:34,991 --> 01:18:37,459
I wonder how your mother
tolerates the two of you.

1218
01:18:38,060 --> 01:18:40,187
Does she ever protest
ordoes she also...

1219
01:18:43,232 --> 01:18:44,426
I don't have a mother.

1220
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:52,268
She passed away.

1221
01:19:05,121 --> 01:19:06,088
I am sorry.

1222
01:19:08,357 --> 01:19:10,018
I had no idea.

1223
01:19:15,231 --> 01:19:16,528
I am really very sorry.

1224
01:19:19,335 --> 01:19:22,998
I know what it feels
liketo not have a mother.

1225
01:19:25,041 --> 01:19:26,133
Why?

1226
01:19:27,343 --> 01:19:28,742
Your mother?

1227
01:19:30,746 --> 01:19:32,441
They died in a car accident.

1228
01:19:33,749 --> 01:19:34,909
I was eight years old then.

1229
01:19:37,453 --> 01:19:40,513
Since then you've been all alone?

1230
01:19:43,326 --> 01:19:44,122
I am sorry.

1231
01:19:44,293 --> 01:19:45,089
No.

1232
01:19:46,028 --> 01:19:47,086
It's alright!

1233
01:19:48,998 --> 01:19:51,762
Actually I never really
missed my parents because...

1234
01:19:53,169 --> 01:19:56,263
my grandparents took their
place. Especially grandpa.

1235
01:19:57,540 --> 01:19:59,337
He was always happy
when I was happy.

1236
01:20:00,142 --> 01:20:02,007
He couldn't live without me.

1237
01:20:02,078 --> 01:20:04,046
Rahul this Rahul that... Rahul...

1238
01:20:06,549 --> 01:20:08,176
He was always there for me!

1239
01:20:08,784 --> 01:20:09,876
My grandpa.

1240
01:20:14,590 --> 01:20:15,887
Still Rahul...

1241
01:20:16,959 --> 01:20:20,827
to go through fifty years
of your life without parents...

1242
01:20:21,330 --> 01:20:22,592
it's not an easy thing!

1243
01:20:22,832 --> 01:20:26,029
Yes Meenamma, it is hard, but...

1244
01:20:28,237 --> 01:20:29,261
Fifty years?

1245
01:20:30,306 --> 01:20:31,170
Yes.

1246
01:20:32,508 --> 01:20:34,169
Do I look like I'm fifty years old?

1247
01:20:35,111 --> 01:20:37,136
Why? You're not?

1248
01:20:38,547 --> 01:20:40,572
Don't tell me you're
more than that?

1249
01:20:42,018 --> 01:20:43,952
I get it.

1250
01:20:44,887 --> 01:20:46,445
Pathetic, corny joke.

1251
01:20:47,523 --> 01:20:49,150
Bloody single screen humour!

1252
01:20:49,225 --> 01:20:51,159
Because you have
no class. You are cheap.

1253
01:20:51,227 --> 01:20:52,421
You are cheap!

1254
01:21:12,948 --> 01:21:15,883
Meenamma,
will you sleep on the floor?

1255
01:21:16,152 --> 01:21:18,279
This is not for me, it's for you.

1256
01:21:18,354 --> 01:21:22,415
Why? Won't you be able to control
yourself if I sleep with you on the bed?

1257
01:21:22,491 --> 01:21:24,925
Shut up, okay! I have a problem.

1258
01:21:24,994 --> 01:21:28,794
Yes exactly, you won't
be able to control yourself.

1259
01:21:28,864 --> 01:21:30,195
Stop your nonsense.

1260
01:21:30,266 --> 01:21:31,164
What does that mean?

1261
01:21:31,233 --> 01:21:31,858
It means stop your nonsense.

1262
01:21:31,934 --> 01:21:32,866
Do?

1263
01:21:32,935 --> 01:21:36,962
Oh my naughty!
Aunty! Remember! Do...

1264
01:21:37,306 --> 01:21:39,797
I will sleep on the bed
because I am your spouse...

1265
01:21:39,875 --> 01:21:41,001
your husband.

1266
01:21:41,077 --> 01:21:44,103
Your mate and don't they say thatthere
is no business like show-her business.

1267
01:21:44,180 --> 01:21:47,707
Come on Meenamma. Let us sleep-amma.

1268
01:21:47,917 --> 01:21:49,885
Fine, sleep if you want.

1269
01:21:49,952 --> 01:21:52,216
Don't tell me I didn't warn you.

1270
01:21:52,288 --> 01:21:54,779
It's quite late at night. I
can give no guarantees.

1271
01:21:54,857 --> 01:21:57,849
Rahul, think about yourself
youwill be taken advantage of...

1272
01:21:57,927 --> 01:21:59,724
tonight because your
wife has no control.

1273
01:21:59,795 --> 01:22:04,494
Shut up. - Baby good night.
Don't let the bed bugs bite.

1274
01:22:13,476 --> 01:22:17,344
Tangaballi... don't come closer.

1275
01:22:17,847 --> 01:22:21,078
I will kick you.

1276
01:22:21,817 --> 01:22:25,082
Tangaballi... don't come closer.

1277
01:22:25,154 --> 01:22:28,487
I will kick you.

1278
01:22:46,008 --> 01:22:48,499
I will not leave you.

1279
01:22:48,811 --> 01:22:50,039
I'm sorry but I don't
know your language.

1280
01:22:50,112 --> 01:22:52,478
Do not come closer.

1281
01:22:56,185 --> 01:22:59,154
Do not come closer... I
will kick you.

1282
01:23:02,425 --> 01:23:03,790
Help me.

1283
01:23:03,859 --> 01:23:06,089
Meena has gone
crazy. Meena has gone mad.

1284
01:23:06,162 --> 01:23:07,891
Meena has gone mad!

1285
01:23:13,169 --> 01:23:15,399
Didn't I tell you
not to sleep next to me?

1286
01:23:15,471 --> 01:23:17,098
Childhood problem...

1287
01:23:17,173 --> 01:23:19,869
I kick in my sleep.

1288
01:23:19,942 --> 01:23:21,876
Am I yourfather's
scooterthat you will kick?

1289
01:23:22,411 --> 01:23:24,902
You're not the daughter of a don.
You're the daughter of a donkey!

1290
01:23:24,980 --> 01:23:25,969
Sorry...

1291
01:23:26,449 --> 01:23:27,609
Come and sleep now!

1292
01:23:27,850 --> 01:23:30,148
Never...
I will never sleep with you.

1293
01:23:31,053 --> 01:23:32,543
You're mad!

1294
01:23:33,222 --> 01:23:33,950
Get lost.

1295
01:23:34,023 --> 01:23:34,921
You get lost.

1296
01:24:40,856 --> 01:24:43,757
Are you dressed upfor
your morning jog?

1297
01:24:44,026 --> 01:24:44,924
No.

1298
01:24:44,994 --> 01:24:47,189
It's the village
ritual for newlyweds.

1299
01:24:47,263 --> 01:24:48,127
Ritual?

1300
01:24:48,964 --> 01:24:52,798
The husband carries his wife in his
arms, up the steps to the temple.

1301
01:24:52,868 --> 01:24:55,166
They believe it strengthens
the marital bond.

1302
01:24:55,237 --> 01:24:56,101
Okay.

1303
01:24:56,839 --> 01:24:59,933
Are you strong?

1304
01:25:00,209 --> 01:25:02,109
What is the need to
be strong to watch a ritual?

1305
01:25:02,177 --> 01:25:04,372
We don't have to watch,
we have to do it.

1306
01:25:05,180 --> 01:25:07,375
We are husband and wife forthem.

1307
01:25:08,017 --> 01:25:10,281
No, I will not be forced
into doing anything.

1308
01:25:10,352 --> 01:25:12,183
No... the situation is like that.

1309
01:25:12,254 --> 01:25:13,084
What?

1310
01:25:14,256 --> 01:25:15,086
Obligation!

1311
01:25:15,157 --> 01:25:16,181
What obligation?

1312
01:25:16,792 --> 01:25:18,350
Do you want to stay here or not?

1313
01:25:18,427 --> 01:25:19,758
Yes, I want to stay.

1314
01:25:19,828 --> 01:25:22,228
Then you will have to carry me.
You won't drop me right?

1315
01:25:23,566 --> 01:25:26,262
Meenamma,
perhaps you are forgetting.

1316
01:25:26,335 --> 01:25:27,996
Don't underestimate
the power of a...

1317
01:25:28,070 --> 01:25:29,196
Sweet Seller?

1318
01:25:30,973 --> 01:25:31,962
Common man.

1319
01:25:34,777 --> 01:25:37,245
Where is the temple?

1320
01:25:37,580 --> 01:25:38,945
Where is the temple?

1321
01:25:43,285 --> 01:25:45,913
Meenamma, where is the temple?

1322
01:25:45,988 --> 01:25:48,047
We will reach the temple
after climbing three hundred steps.

1323
01:25:48,123 --> 01:25:49,112
Three hundred!

1324
01:25:49,191 --> 01:25:50,954
I will reach heaven
after climbing a hundred.

1325
01:25:51,026 --> 01:25:52,084
What happened?

1326
01:25:52,161 --> 01:25:53,594
Where has the power
of the common man gone?

1327
01:25:53,829 --> 01:25:55,057
Meenamma please!

1328
01:25:55,130 --> 01:25:56,461
I know you will
drop me afterfifty.

1329
01:25:56,532 --> 01:25:57,328
Never!

1330
01:25:57,399 --> 01:26:00,061
Don't underestimate
the commonof a power man...

1331
01:26:00,135 --> 01:26:01,966
I meanthe power of a common man.

1332
01:28:17,406 --> 01:28:21,103
Rahul, you carried
yourwife to the temple...

1333
01:28:21,176 --> 01:28:22,268
Bravo.

1334
01:28:22,344 --> 01:28:25,438
Meena, he will take
care of you all your life.

1335
01:28:27,916 --> 01:28:28,905
What is he saying?

1336
01:28:30,052 --> 01:28:33,351
He's saying that you've proved you will
look after me forthe rest of our lives.

1337
01:28:34,490 --> 01:28:35,115
Ya.

1338
01:28:35,190 --> 01:28:37,954
Raaja, may you live
for a hundred years.

1339
01:28:38,260 --> 01:28:42,162
You both will live together
for seven generations.

1340
01:28:43,132 --> 01:28:45,396
Miss Subtitle. What?

1341
01:28:46,034 --> 01:28:49,128
They believe that the couples who
are able to complete this ritual...

1342
01:28:49,204 --> 01:28:51,570
God will keep them together
forthe next seven lives.

1343
01:28:52,441 --> 01:28:56,901
Why haven't you put kumkum?

1344
01:28:57,246 --> 01:28:58,474
What is he saying?

1345
01:29:01,049 --> 01:29:03,415
Without the vermillion
the ritual is not complete.

1346
01:29:04,119 --> 01:29:05,051
What?

1347
01:29:05,387 --> 01:29:06,354
You should've mentioned it earlier.

1348
01:29:06,421 --> 01:29:07,513
That means all of
this has gone to waste?

1349
01:29:07,589 --> 01:29:09,318
My hands and my hips
are hurting so much!

1350
01:29:09,391 --> 01:29:11,052
Put this kumkum my son.

1351
01:29:12,394 --> 01:29:13,861
Oh! She's got it.

1352
01:29:14,396 --> 01:29:15,260
Thank you, aunty.

1353
01:29:15,330 --> 01:29:16,297
Thank you very much.

1354
01:29:17,566 --> 01:29:18,624
No, Rahul.

1355
01:29:35,551 --> 01:29:36,313
What happened?

1356
01:29:37,953 --> 01:29:39,511
This ritual won't be complete
without the vermillion.

1357
01:29:39,588 --> 01:29:40,748
These people will
take us out from here.

1358
01:29:40,989 --> 01:29:42,251
Come on and listen.

1359
01:29:42,324 --> 01:29:42,756
Hurry up.

1360
01:29:42,991 --> 01:29:45,221
We have to descend 300 steps
andthis time you will help me.

1361
01:30:29,271 --> 01:30:41,274
My heart, like a butterflyhas
taken flight far away

1362
01:30:46,421 --> 01:30:55,090
My heart, like a butterflyhas
taken flight far away

1363
01:30:55,163 --> 01:31:02,501
With sweet fragrances
it has gone to stay

1364
01:31:02,571 --> 01:31:08,305
I have neverfelt
this waya ray of light

1365
01:31:08,377 --> 01:31:14,907
kisses the darkness away

1366
01:31:15,150 --> 01:31:23,683
My heart, like a butterflyhas taken
flight far away... Far, far away

1367
01:31:23,926 --> 01:31:29,455
Should I say it in wordsor
inscribe it on the sky

1368
01:31:29,531 --> 01:31:36,164
Praise be to you

1369
01:31:36,371 --> 01:31:44,938
My heart, like a butterflyhas
taken flight far away

1370
01:31:45,013 --> 01:31:53,421
With sweet fragrances
it has gone to stay

1371
01:32:30,425 --> 01:32:34,452
Your deep brown eyes

1372
01:32:34,529 --> 01:32:39,023
Tease me with a glance

1373
01:32:39,101 --> 01:32:43,265
Your soothing words can

1374
01:32:43,338 --> 01:32:47,365
Also put the birds in a trance

1375
01:32:47,442 --> 01:32:49,672
A little incomplete without you,

1376
01:32:50,278 --> 01:32:53,213
Now I feel complete

1377
01:32:53,281 --> 01:32:58,776
Your simplicity has
swept me off my feet

1378
01:32:59,021 --> 01:33:07,554
My heart, like a butterflyhas taken
flight far away... Far, far away

1379
01:33:07,629 --> 01:33:13,090
Should I say it in wordsor
inscribe it on the sky

1380
01:33:13,168 --> 01:33:20,097
Praise be to you

1381
01:33:57,012 --> 01:33:57,910
What happened Rahul?

1382
01:33:58,847 --> 01:34:00,178
What? I am packing.

1383
01:34:00,882 --> 01:34:01,371
Why?

1384
01:34:03,852 --> 01:34:05,945
Do you on living here
in this Vidamba village?

1385
01:34:06,021 --> 01:34:07,181
Look Meenamma, this is enough.

1386
01:34:07,255 --> 01:34:09,155
We will quietly slip
away without telling anyone.

1387
01:34:09,224 --> 01:34:11,215
Otherwise these people will
keep making us do weird rituals.

1388
01:34:11,293 --> 01:34:12,055
You also get ready. Let's go

1389
01:34:12,127 --> 01:34:13,355
No Rahul.

1390
01:34:13,428 --> 01:34:16,158
If we run away from here
then what will the villagers think?

1391
01:34:16,231 --> 01:34:17,892
They will think
that we've run away.

1392
01:34:17,966 --> 01:34:19,263
It's no big deal. Come on.

1393
01:34:19,334 --> 01:34:20,323
You also get ready.

1394
01:34:21,803 --> 01:34:23,828
It's about the villagers
feelings Rahul.

1395
01:34:24,239 --> 01:34:25,763
They will feel hurt!

1396
01:34:25,841 --> 01:34:28,435
What about when they find out
thatwe lied about being married?

1397
01:34:28,677 --> 01:34:30,872
Will they help
anyone the next time?

1398
01:34:30,946 --> 01:34:32,243
Will these people be
able to trust anyone again?

1399
01:34:32,314 --> 01:34:34,942
As it is...

1400
01:34:36,852 --> 01:34:39,787
Do you want to
stay here? Ls that it?

1401
01:34:41,756 --> 01:34:44,247
I've noticed that ever since you've started
playing the role of being my wife...

1402
01:34:44,326 --> 01:34:45,725
you have been having a lot of fun.

1403
01:34:46,228 --> 01:34:48,856
Look, just because I
put vermillion on your head,

1404
01:34:48,930 --> 01:34:50,295
doesn't mean you start
getting serious about it.

1405
01:34:50,365 --> 01:34:51,195
That was a stupid ritual.

1406
01:34:51,266 --> 01:34:52,164
Rahul!

1407
01:34:53,768 --> 01:34:55,929
Only you can think this way!

1408
01:34:57,005 --> 01:34:59,303
Have you thought about
howthe villagers would feel?

1409
01:34:59,808 --> 01:35:03,300
Forget the village, have you thought
about your grandmother's feelings?

1410
01:35:05,514 --> 01:35:09,314
Didn't you say that your grandfather
had replaced your parents.

1411
01:35:10,919 --> 01:35:11,943
And what did you do?

1412
01:35:12,020 --> 01:35:14,921
You changed the place wherehe
wanted his ashes immersed.

1413
01:35:14,990 --> 01:35:16,116
Rameshwaram to Goa!

1414
01:35:16,191 --> 01:35:17,749
Yes! I changed the place.

1415
01:35:17,826 --> 01:35:18,485
Do you know why?

1416
01:35:18,727 --> 01:35:20,957
Because I...
I don't have any feelings.

1417
01:35:21,029 --> 01:35:23,054
I am bad...
actually... I am a very bad man!

1418
01:35:23,131 --> 01:35:24,496
Only you are very good,
these villagers are very good...

1419
01:35:24,733 --> 01:35:26,030
Grandma is. Grandpa is.

1420
01:35:26,101 --> 01:35:28,126
And a bad person has no
rightto stay amongst good people.

1421
01:35:28,203 --> 01:35:31,036
So I'lljust go. You know what,
you keep this with you.

1422
01:35:31,106 --> 01:35:32,767
You are good, he was good.

1423
01:35:32,841 --> 01:35:34,968
All of you make a company
of good people and live together.

1424
01:35:35,043 --> 01:35:36,908
I am not going to live
in this village right.

1425
01:35:39,981 --> 01:35:41,107
Spare me please!

1426
01:35:58,200 --> 01:36:02,796
Even though I was mad,
I had a sinking feeling...

1427
01:36:04,072 --> 01:36:05,562
about leaving Meenamma all alone.

1428
01:36:33,602 --> 01:36:34,796
You've come?

1429
01:36:39,975 --> 01:36:41,806
Rahul! This...

1430
01:37:28,223 --> 01:37:29,554
This is too much!

1431
01:37:37,399 --> 01:37:40,425
One minute, yes. One minute.

1432
01:37:40,502 --> 01:37:42,265
I'll come there.

1433
01:37:42,871 --> 01:37:44,361
Hi Tangaballi sir.

1434
01:37:44,506 --> 01:37:45,871
You and me...

1435
01:37:46,508 --> 01:37:49,272
No personal enmity here, sir.

1436
01:37:50,512 --> 01:37:53,106
Why take me,
go to Komban village and kill?

1437
01:37:53,181 --> 01:37:54,512
No point, sir.

1438
01:37:55,183 --> 01:37:57,378
You've...
you've got your lady, sir.

1439
01:37:58,653 --> 01:38:00,985
Leave me.

1440
01:38:01,289 --> 01:38:03,917
I ready steady go, sir!

1441
01:38:05,427 --> 01:38:06,189
Sir!

1442
01:38:19,074 --> 01:38:20,006
What?

1443
01:38:20,075 --> 01:38:20,973
From my heart, sir.

1444
01:38:21,309 --> 01:38:23,004
I am speaking from my heart, sir.

1445
01:38:23,178 --> 01:38:26,011
Forgive me and forget me.

1446
01:38:26,181 --> 01:38:27,170
Throw it away, sir.

1447
01:38:27,349 --> 01:38:29,249
Do whatever you
wantwith your lady, sir.

1448
01:38:29,317 --> 01:38:30,648
Do... do get married.

1449
01:38:30,885 --> 01:38:32,284
Do what you want to do, sir.

1450
01:38:32,354 --> 01:38:34,447
Just let me go. Thank you.

1451
01:38:34,889 --> 01:38:36,481
Sir, she's your girl.

1452
01:38:36,558 --> 01:38:39,083
You can sing any song
you want to with her.

1453
01:38:39,160 --> 01:38:41,128
Now Meena is all yours, my friend.

1454
01:38:42,297 --> 01:38:43,161
Hey you!

1455
01:38:43,231 --> 01:38:45,665
You're a number stupid,
parasiteand an opportunist!

1456
01:38:45,900 --> 01:38:47,128
You are leaving me and running?

1457
01:38:47,202 --> 01:38:47,634
Try and understand.

1458
01:38:47,702 --> 01:38:48,566
Understand what?

1459
01:38:48,636 --> 01:38:49,102
That...

1460
01:38:49,170 --> 01:38:49,534
What that?

1461
01:38:49,604 --> 01:38:50,298
That only...

1462
01:38:50,372 --> 01:38:51,339
What that only?

1463
01:38:56,911 --> 01:38:58,469
I've played such a game...

1464
01:38:58,546 --> 01:39:03,347
that I fool the opponent
and the game comes into my hands.

1465
01:39:05,186 --> 01:39:08,246
To save you...

1466
01:39:09,324 --> 01:39:11,724
I've played a ruse.

1467
01:39:26,174 --> 01:39:29,075
So this was your strategy?

1468
01:39:29,544 --> 01:39:36,006
Since when did you becomebrave
enough to defend me?

1469
01:39:36,084 --> 01:39:36,982
Meena!

1470
01:39:37,419 --> 01:39:38,852
Washing powder, Meena!

1471
01:39:38,920 --> 01:39:39,386
What?

1472
01:39:39,454 --> 01:39:42,287
No matter how wicked I am,
I am human after all.

1473
01:39:42,357 --> 01:39:45,224
I thought to myself
that I must help you Meena.

1474
01:39:45,293 --> 01:39:48,228
Now did you understand
what I'm saying...

1475
01:39:48,296 --> 01:39:49,228
Meena!

1476
01:39:51,399 --> 01:39:54,425
Pick up the sickle that's...

1477
01:39:56,304 --> 01:40:05,303
right in front of
you and beside Tangaballi

1478
01:40:05,647 --> 01:40:09,344
Yes! I will take it.

1479
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:21,222
I've understood my lady love.

1480
01:40:22,263 --> 01:40:25,164
You two think I don't understand...

1481
01:40:26,534 --> 01:40:29,162
and that you can
make a fool out of me.

1482
01:40:30,238 --> 01:40:31,262
Tangaballi is singing in Hindi?

1483
01:40:31,339 --> 01:40:32,169
Yes!

1484
01:40:32,574 --> 01:40:35,873
Balli Balli I am Tangaballi!

1485
01:40:35,944 --> 01:40:39,345
I know your plan...

1486
01:40:40,181 --> 01:40:42,581
now you're in trouble.

1487
01:40:42,650 --> 01:40:44,675
You will not sing to him anymore.

1488
01:40:44,919 --> 01:40:48,446
Now you will bid farewell
to this world, while doing disco!

1489
01:40:48,990 --> 01:40:49,684
Okay, that's enough!

1490
01:40:49,924 --> 01:40:51,687
Hey Tangu...

1491
01:41:02,270 --> 01:41:03,567
Hey Tangu...

1492
01:41:03,638 --> 01:41:07,039
Touch and show Anna,
I will cut you.

1493
01:41:23,291 --> 01:41:25,657
You do not know...

1494
01:41:26,594 --> 01:41:28,084
whom you are fighting with.

1495
01:41:28,162 --> 01:41:33,293
We are good for good peopleand
at the same time bad for...

1496
01:41:33,368 --> 01:41:34,960
bad people... understand.

1497
01:41:35,470 --> 01:41:40,066
We are in South, but we are
in the centerof people's hearts.

1498
01:41:40,408 --> 01:41:43,707
Whoever ridicules our honor and culture,
we teach them such a lesson that...

1499
01:41:43,945 --> 01:41:45,674
they wet their pants.

1500
01:41:45,747 --> 01:41:46,679
Rahul!

1501
01:41:49,517 --> 01:41:52,145
Meenamma, ready steady go!

1502
01:42:29,691 --> 01:42:31,022
Meena...

1503
01:42:31,326 --> 01:42:33,055
nobody can understand women.

1504
01:42:33,127 --> 01:42:34,788
At a time like this she's
worried about herthings!

1505
01:42:52,680 --> 01:42:55,410
Really,
no one can understand women.

1506
01:43:14,235 --> 01:43:15,099
Come on.

1507
01:43:42,930 --> 01:43:44,864
Here you go, yourticket to Mumbai.

1508
01:43:46,300 --> 01:43:47,096
And you?

1509
01:43:48,002 --> 01:43:53,167
I am going to immerse
Grandpa's ashesin Rameshwaram.

1510
01:43:56,144 --> 01:43:59,170
You know Meenamma,
I just realized...

1511
01:44:00,248 --> 01:44:04,241
the best way to escape your
problems is to... is to face them.

1512
01:44:07,255 --> 01:44:11,191
No matter how wicked I
am, I am human after all, Meena.

1513
01:44:16,964 --> 01:44:18,261
You are right about all...

1514
01:44:19,467 --> 01:44:21,458
just one thing is wrong.

1515
01:44:23,204 --> 01:44:25,263
I will also come
with you to Rameshwaram.

1516
01:44:25,339 --> 01:44:26,931
What? Have you gone mad?

1517
01:44:27,008 --> 01:44:28,032
This is wrong.

1518
01:44:28,409 --> 01:44:30,104
- I'm doing the right thing. - Right, how?

1519
01:44:30,378 --> 01:44:32,073
You've got the chance to
run awaywith such difficulty.

1520
01:44:32,146 --> 01:44:35,172
I could have run away when you were
drunkin the village, if I wanted.

1521
01:44:35,349 --> 01:44:37,510
I didn't run away
then. So how will I, now?

1522
01:44:38,419 --> 01:44:40,353
Lts final Rahul,
I will also come with you.

1523
01:44:40,421 --> 01:44:41,911
Meenamma, try to understand...

1524
01:44:41,989 --> 01:44:44,423
I've taken a decision, let me complete
iton my own accord, please.

1525
01:44:44,492 --> 01:44:46,392
And you might be in dangerthere.

1526
01:44:46,461 --> 01:44:48,156
- What if Tangaballi reaches there? - Exactly.

1527
01:44:48,229 --> 01:44:50,322
I will save you from Tangaballi.

1528
01:44:51,265 --> 01:44:52,994
That's why I should come with you!

1529
01:45:00,875 --> 01:45:01,842
Okay?

1530
01:45:05,546 --> 01:45:06,410
Okay.

1531
01:45:09,150 --> 01:45:09,707
Okay.

1532
01:45:43,050 --> 01:45:47,214
Sometimes two roads
travel side by side.

1533
01:45:47,288 --> 01:45:51,622
They slowly converge
at the end of the ride.

1534
01:45:51,859 --> 01:45:55,818
Sometimes when troubles
become twice their size...

1535
01:45:55,897 --> 01:45:59,833
They are halved when
shared with someone nice

1536
01:45:59,901 --> 01:46:04,531
Our love story is so strange.

1537
01:46:04,605 --> 01:46:08,564
Sometimes we progress,
sometimes we curb.

1538
01:46:08,643 --> 01:46:13,171
Though I am the north
pole and you are the south

1539
01:46:13,247 --> 01:46:17,411
Yet our love has
brought us together.

1540
01:46:17,485 --> 01:46:21,615
Though I am the north
pole and you are the south

1541
01:46:21,856 --> 01:46:27,317
We are equal partners
in every situation.

1542
01:47:09,570 --> 01:47:11,435
Though we fight

1543
01:47:11,505 --> 01:47:13,530
Our partnership is alright

1544
01:47:13,608 --> 01:47:18,102
With you everything seems alright.

1545
01:47:18,479 --> 01:47:22,472
We are two different
peoplewith different attitudes.

1546
01:47:22,550 --> 01:47:26,247
We wanderthe world in style.

1547
01:47:26,320 --> 01:47:30,620
Sometimes we go
apart and come back.

1548
01:47:30,691 --> 01:47:35,094
We live our lives in the momentour
moods change like the seasons

1549
01:47:35,162 --> 01:47:39,121
Though I am the north
pole and you are the south

1550
01:47:39,200 --> 01:47:43,534
The naughty north
has given south a wink.

1551
01:47:43,604 --> 01:47:48,166
Though I am the north
pole and you are the south

1552
01:47:48,242 --> 01:47:52,440
We will be together,
forget about the whole world.

1553
01:47:52,513 --> 01:47:56,540
Sometimes two roads
travel side by side.

1554
01:47:56,617 --> 01:48:01,077
They slowly converge
at the end of the ride.

1555
01:48:01,155 --> 01:48:05,148
Sometimes when troubles
become twice their size...

1556
01:48:05,226 --> 01:48:09,162
They are halved when
shared with someone nice

1557
01:48:09,230 --> 01:48:13,564
Our love story is so strange.

1558
01:48:13,634 --> 01:48:18,094
Sometimes we progress,
sometimes we curb.

1559
01:48:18,172 --> 01:48:22,268
Though I am the north
pole and you are the south

1560
01:48:22,343 --> 01:48:26,507
Yet our love has
brought us together.

1561
01:48:26,580 --> 01:48:31,108
Though I am the north
pole and you are the south

1562
01:48:31,185 --> 01:48:35,781
We are equal partners
in every situation.

1563
01:49:03,050 --> 01:49:05,814
Tomorrow morning we can
complete the immersion ritual.

1564
01:49:05,886 --> 01:49:08,252
Fortonight we will
have to stay in this lodge.

1565
01:50:14,922 --> 01:50:16,753
It's like this, Meena...

1566
01:50:16,824 --> 01:50:19,224
we are all so busy running
around in this fast paced life.

1567
01:50:20,728 --> 01:50:24,027
Our lives are no
less than a marathon...

1568
01:50:24,098 --> 01:50:26,999
we're all running to
gain something in life.

1569
01:50:28,102 --> 01:50:34,063
Then someday we leave
everything and go away.

1570
01:50:39,914 --> 01:50:42,075
Just like I will leave
youand go tomorrow.

1571
01:50:44,952 --> 01:50:47,352
All yourworries
will come to an end.

1572
01:50:50,057 --> 01:50:52,048
I'm going away forever, Rahul.

1573
01:50:59,500 --> 01:51:01,934
But where will you go?

1574
01:51:04,939 --> 01:51:06,031
Puna...

1575
01:51:09,009 --> 01:51:10,943
My childhood friend lives there.

1576
01:51:11,011 --> 01:51:11,875
Chitra.

1577
01:51:20,187 --> 01:51:22,951
I was wondering Meenamma whether
you will be safe there or not...

1578
01:51:23,757 --> 01:51:26,282
I mean what if you father's
goons or your cousins reach there?

1579
01:51:32,032 --> 01:51:33,124
Meenamma you come
with me to Mumbai...

1580
01:51:33,200 --> 01:51:34,531
My house is there...
grandma is there...

1581
01:51:34,768 --> 01:51:36,759
You can stay there peacefully.

1582
01:51:37,171 --> 01:51:40,163
Thereafter, you can decide for
yourself, as to what you want to do.

1583
01:51:41,175 --> 01:51:43,473
You can start afresh.

1584
01:51:47,014 --> 01:51:48,845
And what if my father's
goonsreach there?

1585
01:51:49,450 --> 01:51:50,815
That's not his kingdom.

1586
01:51:50,885 --> 01:51:52,546
That is not Komban village,
it's Mumbai.

1587
01:51:53,053 --> 01:51:54,247
Nobody can do such a thing there.

1588
01:51:54,321 --> 01:51:58,155
And if my father asks you,
what I am doing in your house...

1589
01:52:00,261 --> 01:52:01,888
what will you say then?

1590
01:52:03,931 --> 01:52:06,559
Then I will tell him...
both of us, you know...

1591
01:52:07,334 --> 01:52:08,494
You and me.

1592
01:52:12,339 --> 01:52:13,806
It's okay, Rahul.

1593
01:52:17,011 --> 01:52:18,774
Pune is fine for me.

1594
01:52:23,050 --> 01:52:24,574
Anyway I have troubled you a lot.

1595
01:52:25,219 --> 01:52:31,021
It's not your sympathy, but
your love that I seek

1596
01:52:35,930 --> 01:52:41,163
I ask for your love
as I know you love me too

1597
01:52:41,235 --> 01:52:43,396
Because of the fear of the world

1598
01:52:44,071 --> 01:52:50,806
I promise I will never
forfeit you, my dear

1599
01:52:52,313 --> 01:53:02,120
I will never let you go

1600
01:53:03,224 --> 01:53:07,593
I will never let you go

1601
01:53:08,562 --> 01:53:12,498
I will never let you go

1602
01:53:12,933 --> 01:53:15,595
If this isn't love

1603
01:53:16,503 --> 01:53:21,065
Then what is love?

1604
01:53:21,141 --> 01:53:24,599
Now that I have won your love

1605
01:53:24,845 --> 01:53:29,077
I don't care if I lose the world

1606
01:53:29,350 --> 01:53:34,413
I will never let you go

1607
01:53:35,122 --> 01:53:40,458
My life has lost its meaning

1608
01:53:43,497 --> 01:53:48,400
Since you are not there with me

1609
01:53:51,372 --> 01:53:54,102
Love is renowned

1610
01:53:54,174 --> 01:53:56,642
Since on this path
I have walked down.

1611
01:53:56,877 --> 01:54:01,371
I will not leave it mid way...

1612
01:54:02,483 --> 01:54:07,580
From the path of your
love, I will not stray

1613
01:54:08,289 --> 01:54:23,694
I will never let you go

1614
01:54:39,920 --> 01:54:47,417
I will never let you go

1615
01:55:36,043 --> 01:55:37,670
Where have we come,
Rahul... I don't know...

1616
01:55:37,745 --> 01:55:39,110
We've come to the right place,
Meenamma.

1617
01:55:39,613 --> 01:55:40,841
They will kill you...

1618
01:55:41,048 --> 01:55:42,515
- Without thinking twice... - No, Meena.

1619
01:55:43,784 --> 01:55:45,843
I have come to a decision
after a lot of consideration.

1620
01:55:49,056 --> 01:55:50,023
Rahul, you have gone mad.

1621
01:55:50,090 --> 01:55:51,022
We had run away from here.

1622
01:55:51,091 --> 01:55:52,251
But for how long will you run?

1623
01:55:52,760 --> 01:55:53,988
But for how long will you run?

1624
01:55:54,194 --> 01:55:55,923
Don't you have any dreams
ora life of your own?

1625
01:56:11,011 --> 01:56:11,943
Hello, sir.

1626
01:56:12,579 --> 01:56:15,605
You must be wonderinghow
I am back here by myself?

1627
01:56:15,749 --> 01:56:17,148
Dad... he means to say...

1628
01:56:17,217 --> 01:56:18,241
No, Meenamma.

1629
01:56:18,986 --> 01:56:22,012
Today yourfather and
me don't needany translation.

1630
01:56:22,523 --> 01:56:23,490
No subtitles!

1631
01:56:23,757 --> 01:56:24,951
We're good.

1632
01:56:26,560 --> 01:56:31,588
Because today I will talk
and you will have to listen.

1633
01:56:33,634 --> 01:56:35,568
Mr. Durgeshwara Azag...

1634
01:56:37,237 --> 01:56:38,135
Sir!

1635
01:56:38,906 --> 01:56:41,306
The most importand
man of Komban village.

1636
01:56:41,542 --> 01:56:42,509
Don!

1637
01:56:43,010 --> 01:56:43,942
Good, sir...

1638
01:56:44,011 --> 01:56:45,103
It's very good
to be important, sir.

1639
01:56:45,179 --> 01:56:47,773
But it's more important to be good.

1640
01:56:50,717 --> 01:56:52,617
You must be thinking
why I havecome here?

1641
01:56:52,686 --> 01:56:54,176
Who is he?

1642
01:56:55,789 --> 01:56:56,915
Am I mad?

1643
01:56:56,990 --> 01:56:58,287
Or am I drunk?

1644
01:56:58,525 --> 01:56:59,719
No sir, not mad.

1645
01:56:59,793 --> 01:57:00,316
And no drinks.

1646
01:57:00,561 --> 01:57:01,755
Not drunk.

1647
01:57:02,296 --> 01:57:03,729
Sober, sir.

1648
01:57:04,565 --> 01:57:07,329
I just came to find out why you
are beingso harsh towards Meena.

1649
01:57:07,568 --> 01:57:09,001
Why?

1650
01:57:10,037 --> 01:57:13,268
Don't you love your daughter?

1651
01:57:13,707 --> 01:57:14,935
No?

1652
01:57:15,943 --> 01:57:18,571
Because in a wedding yougive
your daughter's hand in marriage.

1653
01:57:18,712 --> 01:57:21,237
But you tried to
sacrifice her life.

1654
01:57:22,149 --> 01:57:23,844
Would a father do such a thing?

1655
01:57:25,285 --> 01:57:29,585
No father should be like you.

1656
01:57:31,058 --> 01:57:33,219
No fatherwill be like you.

1657
01:57:33,293 --> 01:57:34,726
Sir...

1658
01:57:38,065 --> 01:57:39,760
I am sorry, sir.

1659
01:57:40,234 --> 01:57:42,668
I am a Sweet Seller. Sweet.

1660
01:57:45,205 --> 01:57:47,230
But I will say something bitter.

1661
01:57:47,808 --> 01:57:50,140
You can be the father of this village,
the God father of this village...

1662
01:57:50,210 --> 01:57:52,872
but you cannot be your
daughter's father. Never, sir.

1663
01:57:54,915 --> 01:57:59,011
Your pull and power,
full marks forthat, very good, sir.

1664
01:57:59,620 --> 01:58:02,214
But in one subject
you have failed, zero...

1665
01:58:02,289 --> 01:58:03,654
full zero, sir.

1666
01:58:05,225 --> 01:58:06,192
Emotion, sir.

1667
01:58:06,960 --> 01:58:08,393
Don't you have any value
foryour daughter's emotions...

1668
01:58:08,629 --> 01:58:10,824
herwish, her happiness? No value?

1669
01:58:11,999 --> 01:58:13,125
No importance?

1670
01:58:13,934 --> 01:58:14,901
Why sir?

1671
01:58:16,236 --> 01:58:17,294
Let me tell you, sir.

1672
01:58:18,672 --> 01:58:21,641
We are in the sixty
sixth year of independence.

1673
01:58:22,242 --> 01:58:24,369
But just like Meena the others
girls in this village have...

1674
01:58:24,611 --> 01:58:26,806
...no right to celebrate
that independence.

1675
01:58:27,214 --> 01:58:28,272
No right!

1676
01:58:28,682 --> 01:58:29,706
And you people too...

1677
01:58:30,183 --> 01:58:33,949
if you don't care for your daughter's
emotions, then this entire village...

1678
01:58:34,755 --> 01:58:36,416
this unity, Periyathalai!

1679
01:58:36,657 --> 01:58:38,420
This power is nothing, sir.

1680
01:58:39,159 --> 01:58:40,683
I say it's nothing!

1681
01:58:45,065 --> 01:58:46,327
And you Mr. Tangaballi.

1682
01:58:46,767 --> 01:58:48,064
You're so tall, so big!

1683
01:58:48,135 --> 01:58:50,831
But with a small heart.

1684
01:58:51,405 --> 01:58:52,235
Now what do we do?

1685
01:58:52,306 --> 01:58:54,001
Do we fight? Come on...

1686
01:58:54,074 --> 01:58:55,666
Come on. Let's fight.

1687
01:58:55,742 --> 01:58:56,970
Hit me.

1688
01:58:58,345 --> 01:59:01,178
I will not fight back becausel
want to do the right thing.

1689
01:59:01,248 --> 01:59:02,078
No.

1690
01:59:02,749 --> 01:59:03,773
It is straight and simple.

1691
01:59:03,850 --> 01:59:05,283
I am a common man. I get angry.

1692
01:59:05,819 --> 01:59:08,219
And don't underestimate
the power of a common man.

1693
01:59:09,189 --> 01:59:10,417
What is it that you had said?

1694
01:59:11,291 --> 01:59:14,089
"You have come here alive. But you
won't leave here alive", wasn't it?

1695
01:59:14,161 --> 01:59:17,028
"I will cut you into
pieces and parcel it"

1696
01:59:17,097 --> 01:59:17,791
Ya?

1697
01:59:18,065 --> 01:59:20,090
I will fight now. I
will fight with you.

1698
01:59:20,867 --> 01:59:22,425
I will fight with each of your men.

1699
01:59:22,869 --> 01:59:24,234
Fight everyone!

1700
01:59:24,438 --> 01:59:26,963
Fight the entire village
if I have to. Only for Meena.

1701
01:59:28,175 --> 01:59:30,143
Because I love her.

1702
01:59:33,013 --> 01:59:34,037
I do.

1703
01:59:59,272 --> 02:00:00,603
Rahul!

1704
02:00:29,302 --> 02:00:30,360
Father, please!

1705
02:03:59,646 --> 02:04:01,273
Rahul!

1706
02:04:08,989 --> 02:04:10,456
Rahul!

1707
02:04:20,066 --> 02:04:22,557
Rahul!

1708
02:07:07,567 --> 02:07:08,932
Come.

1709
02:07:09,702 --> 02:07:10,760
Come on.

1710
02:07:11,871 --> 02:07:13,031
Fight me.

1711
02:07:15,375 --> 02:07:17,570
Come on everyone.

1712
02:07:27,720 --> 02:07:28,345
Enough.

1713
02:07:30,323 --> 02:07:32,314
No more fights.

1714
02:07:33,660 --> 02:07:43,695
My body is no doubt very big
but your courage is even bigger!

1715
02:07:45,705 --> 02:07:47,696
Very big.

1716
02:08:13,833 --> 02:08:15,198
You are like us!

1717
02:08:17,203 --> 02:08:18,261
Real man!

1718
02:08:20,073 --> 02:08:22,803
You win!

1719
02:08:24,711 --> 02:08:25,370
You win!

1720
02:08:27,647 --> 02:08:30,275
Go, Meena is yours.

1721
02:08:31,284 --> 02:08:32,751
Meena is yours.

1722
02:08:47,834 --> 02:08:51,930
Rahul and Meena will get married.

1723
02:09:18,998 --> 02:09:20,158
He will take care
of you his entire life.

1724
02:09:20,233 --> 02:09:22,497
Will look after me
forthe rest of our lives.

1725
02:09:24,304 --> 02:09:25,862
You both will live
togetherfor seven lives.

1726
02:09:25,939 --> 02:09:27,907
Those who complete the ritual...

1727
02:09:27,974 --> 02:09:29,999
are kept together by
God, for next seven lives.

1728
02:10:06,412 --> 02:10:07,936
You love me a lot, don't you?

1729
02:10:15,121 --> 02:10:17,851
Then we should have
just elopedfrom Rameshwaram.

1730
02:10:18,424 --> 02:10:20,449
Why did you risk coming to Komban?

1731
02:10:20,526 --> 02:10:25,054
Meenamma, don't underestimate
the power of a...

1732
02:10:25,265 --> 02:10:26,323
Sweet Seller?

1733
02:10:29,802 --> 02:10:30,996
Sweet Seller.

1734
02:10:35,108 --> 02:10:39,169
Now will you nod your head
forwhat I am about to ask you?

1735
02:10:43,049 --> 02:10:47,918
Do you love me as
much as I love you?

1736
02:10:54,127 --> 02:10:55,754
Meena Lochini...

1737
02:10:57,997 --> 02:10:59,862
will you marry me?

1738
02:11:05,972 --> 02:11:10,466
Will you kick me at night, mistaking
mefor yourfather's scooter?

1739
02:11:26,893 --> 02:11:31,853
Sixteen hundred and thirty five
languages are spoken in our country.

1740
02:11:32,098 --> 02:11:36,501
But today I realized, that the
most important language is - love!

1741
02:11:37,370 --> 02:11:39,565
Indeed, love has no language...

1742
02:11:40,039 --> 02:11:41,370
And I would give
the entire credit for...

1743
02:11:41,441 --> 02:11:43,204
...the common man becoming
the hero of Komban village...

1744
02:11:43,276 --> 02:11:44,903
to my grandfather

1745
02:11:44,977 --> 02:11:46,205
My grandfather!

1746
02:11:46,546 --> 02:11:48,446
He gave me a wake up call when...

1747
02:11:48,514 --> 02:11:51,278
I was immersing his ashes
in the waters of Rameshwaram.

1748
02:11:52,085 --> 02:11:53,245
Well all said and done.

1749
02:11:53,319 --> 02:11:57,415
One wrong train. Chennai
Express showed me the right way.

1750
02:11:57,957 --> 02:12:00,949
And today this Rahul,
will surely tell Meenamma...

1751
02:12:01,160 --> 02:12:04,061
...thatthose who love,
are the one's who get the girl.

1752
02:12:04,560 --> 02:15:37,061
