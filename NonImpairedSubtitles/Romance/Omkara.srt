1
00:03:52,007 --> 00:03:55,099
There is a little thread-like difference
between foolish and bastard person

2
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,099
On one side is foolish, other is of bastard

3
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:07,099
And if someone pulls the thread then
who is foolish and who is bastard is the
question of 10 million

4
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,099
Let's see the groom

5
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,099
You are a silly guy

6
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,099
But a man becomes foolish after marriage

7
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,099
And you marriage is impossible

8
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,099
No... it must

9
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,099
l said it is not possible

10
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,099
Your bride will be snatched by Omkara

11
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,099
Omi brother

12

You are my best friend, therefore

15

19
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:57,099
You can’t proceed further for your bride

20
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:07,000

00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:48,099

Am l stupid?

38
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,099
Sometime Red, sometime Blue, Yellow, etc.

39
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Decide once that which ball l've to hit.
Ultimately you've to lose, l swear

40
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,099
Okay... Come on my friend

00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,099
Yeah! Look there my brother-in-law
the yellow ball has been bit

45
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,099
l will certainly be the winner if a
tournament of ball-hitting is held

46
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Is there any body who could play with me?

47
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:18,099
Where is Omi?

48
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,099

Hey you bastard English man

51
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,099
Even dog peas by leaving 10 houses
by his own Mr. Omi

52
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,099
Had you to chose just my daughter
in whole country?

53
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,099
Right

54
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,099
But that is my mistake

55
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,099

56
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Half of the blood in you is of that prostitute,

57
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,099
Sir, Mr. Lawyer... you've commendably
recognized my class

58
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,099
But you haven’t listened the voice of heart
of your daughter

59
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,099
Cruel father

Indur Singh went to Muscat

83
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,099
And this Surinder captain

84
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,099
He is behind all of this

85
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,099
He has hidden him behind
that Pilkay's brickyard

86
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:45,000
And why this Indur Singh is purchasing
this wet wood

87
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,099
The posession of any metal good, cell phone,
SlM card, etc. is prohibited to keep

88
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,099
Any equipment, lighter, matchbox, or mobile
SIM cards are not allowed to take in

89
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,099
The visitors are informed that in prison...

90
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,099
Hey... l am taking in all such things.
What will you do?

91
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:15,099
You are lying

92
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,099
Hey you damn

93
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,099
Stamp my hand

94
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,099
l am seeing Omkara since my childhood

95
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:38,000
l have never heard his relationship
with any girl

96
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,099
Have you ever seen Dolly closely brother?

97
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,099
Do you think if she could run with
that bastard horrible criminal

98
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,099
as per her wish

99
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,099
No stove has been fired in my
house since yesterday

100
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,099
Furthermore, humiliation in family

101
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,099
And how l can offer my flower like
Daughter to that wicked person

102
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,099
There is a difference of caste, too

103
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,099
l need justice

104
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:47,099
Otherwise, you will see my dead face

105
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,099

Omi brother, let's go

107
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,099
Dear brother, in my view the kidnappers are

108
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I will present my cut tongue to you
if his daughter would tell me liar

109
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:31,000
You stay here I park the bike

110
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,099
Don't be afraid my daughter

111
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,099
And tell everything openly

112
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,099
That if anyone...
any person

113
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,099
has forced you or tried to kidnap you

114
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,099
Don't be afraid my daughter l am here

115
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,099
Just speak only truth

116
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:03,099
l am just bound of my will

117
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,099
Dad... Please forgive me

118
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:18,000
l can’t live without Omkara

119
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:31,099
* Don’t pay any attention to eyes

120
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:38,099
* Don’t listen to them

121
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,099
* Don’t pay any attention to eyes

122
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,099
* Don’t listen to them

123
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,099
* Don’t listen to them

124
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,099
* Eyes will cheat you...

125
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:59,099
* Eyes will cheat you...

126
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,099
* Eyes will cheat you...

127
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,099
* Eyes will cheat you...

128
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:14,099
* They’ll mesmerize you
* while you’re awake

129
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,099
* They’ll mesmerize you
* while awake and destroy your sleep

130
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,099
* Eyes will cheat you...

131
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:25,099
* Eyes will cheat you...

132
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:35,000
l was plunged in love with Omkara

133
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,099
But until l could fully realize it...
It was too late

134
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:49,000
* Don’t pay any attention to eyes...

135
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:04,099
* Eyes don’t differentiate
* between good and bad,
* loved ones and strangers

136
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,099
* They just love to sting

137
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,099
l was burning day & night in Omkara's love

138
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,099
Like a drowning sparrow in dark well!

139
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,099
l had no way to come up with

140
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,099
* Their poison is intoxicating

141
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,099
* Their poison is intoxicating

142
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,099
Finally, l decided to suicide

143
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,099
But then l thought l should inform that person
at least in whose love l am dieing

144
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:47,099
* Eyes show you rainbows in clouds
* which rain till morning

145
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,099
* They’ll show you rainbows
* and drive you mad

146
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,099
Rajju will come to marry me,
but just with my dead body

147
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,099
You've no courage to tell me

148
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,099
But l've the courage to say you that

149
00:18:59,000 --> 00:18:59,099
* Eyes will cheat you...

150
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,099
l only love you and will remain yours forever

151
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:13,000
include my name in your murder list, too

152
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,099
Okay now forget it what has happened

153
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,099
Stand up daughter

154
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:37,000
You both request for pardon from
your lawyer father

155
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,099
Now, You will've to wait it for marriage
until l am released

156
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,099
it doesn’t make any difference
for us to be in prison

157
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,099
But if witness records
his statement in court then

158
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,099
Our name will be excluded
in coming election member list

159
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:23,099
And if they don't understand in a gentle way

160
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Then go ahead with your own method

161
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:50,099
Mr. Omkara, be careful of a woman's trick

162
00:20:51,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Which girl can cheat her father
what one can expect better from her

163
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:23,000
OMKARA

164
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:54,099
Fill it as you want

165
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,099
Hey catch this damn up... it is flying

166
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,099
Hey Gijlo... You know that to earn from illegal
sources has been written in our fate

167
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,099
Just from illegal sources...

168
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,099

Our lndur brother is trying vigorously
For that for last 5 years

172
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,099
Even if he keeps trying for his 5 lives,
he can’t defeat our Tewari brother

173
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,099
You're exactly right

174
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:42,099
But that is when if he stands in election

175
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:48,099
His pant, shirt cost will be higher than
the money given to beat him

176
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Understand

177
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,099

Hey... What a fragrance is this?

282
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,099
You seem to be a proficient cook

283
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,099
Hey...
Who taught you to make this sweet dish?

284
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,099
My Grand mom

285
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,099
She used to say that man's heart
can be explored through his stomach

286
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:16,000
But my grand mom used to say that path is
"just below the belly"

287
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:39,000
These have been sent by father for election

288
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,099
But the elections are too far away now

289
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:53,099
Yes, of course

290
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,099
Omi brother...
We did'nt make any mistake in that job

291
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:07,000
lf we could've known that you are

stopped wedding

292
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,099

293

296
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,099

297
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:54,000

301
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:37,099

00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Jump, you damn bastard

322
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Hey... Can’t you swim?

323
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:33,099
You saw Langda brother that
l have brain in my occipital

324
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,099
But the matter is not of brain

325
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,099
The matter is of business

326
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:49,000
lf l do something irregular,
my father's business will be in danger

327
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,099
And you Langda brother

328
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,099
What you did of Omi?

329
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:03,099
When Omi made Kesu the administrator
of party before whole village

330
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Don't l know that you were trying to be
on that seat for last 15 years with your one leg

331
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Langda Tyagi...
"new administrator"

332
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,099
That damn, a teenager English man came

333
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:35,099
And taken all fruits before all people,
which you deserved for

334
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,099
Where was your brain at that time?

335
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Company garden

336
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,099
You are saying exactly right Rajju

337
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Actually, both of us have horrible luck

338
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:20,000
You damn bastard

339
00:46:53,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Happy birthday to you

340
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,099
The water of stream was very cold...
You bastard

341
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:15,099
l am not feeling well

342
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:25,000
But because of it
you learned how to swim?

343
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:31,099
So from today
l will teach you how to fly?

344
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,099
Like a pigeon

345
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,099
Like this

346
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:42,099
And who will be with you...

347
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,099
Yours Dolly

348
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:52,099
You both would fly far

349
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:58,099
till the stars in sky

350
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,099
Yes, l understand

351
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:12,000
lf l would lie l will be like dog,
otherwise your father

352
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:20,099
Have you found time for me, damn?

353
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,099
Always talk to Administrator
with keeping eyes lower

354
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,099
Understand

355
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,099
OKay... My honey

356
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:37,099
Oh darling l will remove your tongue

357
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:45,099
l will not even allow you to taste my tongue

358
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:53,099
Oh my Chaman Bahar

359
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,099
Why?

360
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Because you know,
you are very beautiful

361
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:10,099
And do you know
why l love you?

362
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:18,099
Because you say the same words
to every third girl

363
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,099
Hey you didn’t tell

364
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,099
What?

365
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:26,099
Will you marry me?

366
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Hey... Leave me mad man?

367
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:43,099
There had been years when no child is
born after marriage in this house

368
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,099
And then my father fell in love

369
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:51,099
And l was born in that result of love

370
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,099
My Mom belonged to another caste

371
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Therefore, l am called half of that class

372
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:10,099
Whether moon is half

373
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Even so that is called moon

374
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,099
What happened?

375
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:32,000
l twisted my back incidentally this morning

376
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Shukla is out of senses!

377
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:53,099
Where is this new Administrator?
l can’t see him

378
00:51:54,000 --> 00:52:00,099
He is ringing music...
You start dancing

379
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:05,099
Hey you administrator
Come here, too

380
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:13,099
Please, take care
of poor people's problems, too

381
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:17,099
Take seat... Sir... Please

382
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,099
How are you talking...
Friend

383
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,099
What would like to drink?

384
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,099
No thanks l've already ordered for tea

385
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,099
Tea?

386
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,099
Will you not drink?

387
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,099
No friend No

388
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:34,099
This is the only thing,
which take me out of my senses

389
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:40,099
Okay, l understand

390
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:41,099
Hey... Mental

391
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:51,000
Go stat to City and take a Milk Bottle
For this Administrator

392
00:52:51,000 --> 00:53:00,000
Along with its nipple

393
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,099
Dolly... Take it and wear around your back

394
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,099
Whose ornament is this?

395
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:26,099
This is not ornament,
but my family's tradition from centuries

396
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:30,099
Which always has been worn by
the ladies of our home

397
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:36,099
Today, l give it to you as deposit

398
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:42,099
Keep it in strict custody

399
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:47,099
First wear it

400
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:57,000
No first you close your eyes then
l will wear it

401
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:02,099
Hey... Billo

402
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,099
Yes?

403
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:10,099
We want to listen that "Beedi" song

404
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:15,099
l have forgotten that song

405
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,099
for which you are asking

406
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:29,000
No problem...
We start singing and you will recollect

407
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,099
* No sheet...

408
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:49,099
* Or even a blanket...

409
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,099
* No sheet or even a blanket

410
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:57,099

411
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,099

412
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:05,099

413
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:13,099
* It's so cold,

414
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:18,099
* Go steal the fire
* from the neighbor's kitchen

415
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:23,099
* Go steal the fire
* from the neighbor's kitchen

416
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,099
* Light your cigarette

417
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,099
* with my heart, my love

418
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:38,099
* A great fire burns in it

419
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,099
* Light your cigarette
* with my heart, my love

420
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:47,099
* A great fire burns in it

421
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:55,099
* Don't blow smoke
* from those lips, my love

422
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,099
* Don't blow smoke
* from those lips, my love

423
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:05,099
* This world is a cheat [smoky]

424
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:10,099
* Light the coal
* with my heart, my love

425
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,099
* In it burns a fire

426
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,099
* No sheet or even a blanket

427
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:21,099
* When the cold wind blows against us

428

00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,099
* Call me like this some afternoon

436

* Cut so deep that
* they left marks like a bite

445
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:53,099
* This knife even a farmer
* wouldn't use

446
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:58,099
* Such a tyrant,

* from the neighbor's kitchen

462
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:36,099
Hey you bastard

463
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Hey Langda brother...
Come and guard me

464
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,099
Hey... Have you drunken a lot?...
Leave it

465
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:02,099
Get lost you bastard

466

Hey wait...

467
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:31,000
Omi brother...
Hey Omi brother

468
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:08,000
Hey... Don't you have tongue in your mouth?

469
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,099
Who did start the fight?

470
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:17,099
Langda

471
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:23,099
Now cool down Omi brother...
We will talk tomorrow morning

472
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,099
Don't talk fool

473
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,099
Answer me what l am asking?

474
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:36,099
Who is responsible of that?

475
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:41,099
Of wine

476
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,099
The guilty is only wine

477
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:48,099
And then of mine

478
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:55,099
This innocent guy told me that he can’t
keep his senses intact after drinking

479
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:00,099
l forced him and he drank

480
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:10,000
First you punish me Omi brother,
then to him

481
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Hey Administrator...
The only fault is of mine,
but not yours or Langdla

482
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:25,099
That l chosen you for administrator

483
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:30,099
l don't want to see you again
for some days

484
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:40,000
Otherwise, l will cut your skin shreds
and dry them in sunshine

485
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:58,099
Hey... Omi's anger is just like,
as Pooja's Kapoor

486
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:04,099
Will disappear like this

487
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:08,099
Am l fool that l am baking breads for him

488
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,099
And this Administrator is still in that fight

489
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,099
Friend... What is wrong with food?

490
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,099
Eat it hurry up

491
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:20,099
Hey... Start eating

492
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:30,000
Hey... Look start eating otherwise l will be angry

493
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,099
The smile seems to be every expensive in this worl

494
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:36,099
Don't worry l will talk to Omi

495
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:44,099
Don't worry l will talk to Omi...
And he will listen to you, indeed

496
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,099
Omi will not listen to any one, now

497
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:53,099
Not me, not you, not him,
and not of anyone other

498
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,099
Omi's ears will be listening of one's voice only

499
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:01,099
Just Dolly's voice

500
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,099
And Dolly is your old friend

501
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,099
Right?

502
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:10,099
We all are going to City for some days to see
Big Boss for the planning of coming elections

503
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:15,099
Meanwhile, you talk to Dolly

504
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:16,099
Okay

505
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,099
Not just okay...
lt is best idea

506
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:23,099
Hey take it...
Open your mouth

507
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:33,000
ln your complete life you hav'nt give
me food in a such way

508
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:38,099
Okay... Really

509
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:44,099
Okay... Okay... Why are you worrying?
We're in the way, will handle as we reach

510
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:48,099
This Aunt is trying to hide something
even from us

511
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,099
According to ClD report

512
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:58,099
Our lives are in danger

513
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:03,099
lt will take me 2-3 days to satisfy her

514
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,099
What 2-3 days

515
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:12,099
Meanwhile,
We could start working on Bhandai Jee project

516
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:16,099

517
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:21,099
He is absolutely right

518
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:25,099

them back from where they got into train

522
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,099
What?

523
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,099
Yes.

524
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:55,099
Kohlo, whenever you need the sugarcane
what do you do?

525
01:06:56,000 --> 01:07:00,099

And lndu Sister whenever you required

527
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:11,099
Oh... l have had to press
the Omi's legs for a long time

528
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:15,099
So...
Your work will also be done

529
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,099
But you must will have to do
something for us against that

530
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,099
Mr. Kesu

531
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,099

Promise

534

Now you sing

535
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,099
Everything is okay except

536
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:58,000
"bottom"

537
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,099
"Bottom"
l spoke correctly

538
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,099
Okay... No problem...
You keep saying this

539
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:14,000
What?

540
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,099
Omi brother

541
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,099
But Langda brother said that
they will come in 2-3 days

542
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:52,099
Oh... He will ruin me

543
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,099
Hey... Where are you going?
l talk to him before you

544
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,099
No... No...
He will put out my skin and will dry in sunshine

545
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:08,000
l am going

546
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,099
This was Kesu... Right

547
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:15,099
Kesu

548
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:20,099
You now leave that child

549
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:26,099
You and me,
both are out of village
and Dolly is alone at home

550
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,099
But that seemed to be his Motorbike

551
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:36,099
Oh... He is our Kesu, not a thief who will
run after seeing the owner of house

552
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:43,099
Just wait a minute...
l call on his cellphone

553
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:47,099
Hey... Hello... Hey Mental

554
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:52,099
Son... Give phone to Kesu for a momemnt

555
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:57,099
Okay

556
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:05,099
Okay... Then do me an SMS

557
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,099
What happened?

558
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,099
l don't know why it is not starting

559
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:13,099
Not Car, l am asking about Kesu

560
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:14,099
Kesu

561
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,099
Oh... lt has started now

562
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,099
Langda

563
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:26,099
Why are you hiding something?

564
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:32,099
Because l am still not believing
that he was Kesu

565
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:42,000
And l can't understand that what he was
doing with lonely Dolly in your house

566
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:56,000
Dolly

567
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:08,000
Dolly

568
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:25,000
Why did Kesu come here?

569
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:35,000
And why he ran away as he saw me?

570
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:09,099
What happened?

571
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:14,099
Tell me what happened?

572
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:16,099
Tell me

573
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:20,099
Whenever l see you from deep of my heart,
soon one thing comes into my mind

574
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:30,000
What?

575
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:41,000
That whether you are very innocent,
otherwise a whore

576
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:50,099
* Oh, my lover

* hope the day never sets

580
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:15,099
* My veil will hold back the day

581
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:19,099
* and run after the sunlight

582
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:23,099
* Let the shade not touch us

583
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:33,000
* Oh, my lover

584
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:40,099
* Oh, my lover

585
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:46,099
* hope the day never sets

586
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:50,099
* My veil will hold back the day

587
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:54,099
* and run after the sunlight

588
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:58,099
* Let the shade not touch us

589
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:08,000
* Oh, my lover

590
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:13,099
Hey...

591
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:18,099
What's that, a Tiger

592
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:22,099
No

593
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,099
Fox?

594
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:32,099
No

595
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,099
Snake?

596
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:40,099
No.

597
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:47,099
Girgat?

598
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:57,000
My Rabbit

599
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:04,099
Would'nt you eat food?

600
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,099
No

601
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:17,000
Will drink your blood

602
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:28,099
* Oh my queen,

603
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:34,099
* my doll,

604
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,099
* c'mon wake up now

605
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,099
* Wake up my little doll,

606
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:42,099
* my sweetie,

607
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:52,000
* your eyes are so sweet

608
01:19:53,000 --> 01:20:02,000
* The morning's kiss

609
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:12,000
* Listen to it and wake up now

610
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:19,099

* (like King Dashrath, known for his word)

613
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:36,099
* Get rid of the night from your eyes

614
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:42,099
l have opened my eyes...
Now ask what you want?

615
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:49,099
Think carefully

616
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:54,099
Forgive Kesu

617
01:20:55,000 --> 01:21:02,099
Hey... Are you listening?

618
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:04,099
What happened?

619
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:06,099
Have you forgiven him?

620
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:07,099
That can'nt be

621
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:12,099
Why?

622
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:18,099
lf l forgave him such quickly
then he may do this again mistake

623
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:28,000
So you will be angry with him
for his whole life

624
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:38,000
And for the next time don't promise to anyone

625
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:47,099
You promise breaker

626
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:53,099
Okay, will forgive him in wedding

627
01:21:54,000 --> 01:22:03,000
Then Should l call the Pandit...
Crual person

628
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:14,099
Means 30th of next month

629
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:16,099
Hey... You listened

630
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,099
30th of next month is expected to
a fortunate day for wedding

631
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:26,099
Means, you must have to forgive Kesu
within the next 5 weeks

632
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:30,099
You've to forgive Kesu...

633
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:36,099
She is more happier on Kesu pardon
than the wedding, l guess

634
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:41,099
l think she likes Kesu very much

635
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:46,099
Do they already know each other?

636
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,099
They've studied in same college

637
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:51,099
Oh...

638
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:57,099
Therefore

639
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:01,099
So what?

640
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,099
No... No... No

641
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,099
My mind is filled with disgusting thoughts

642
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:09,099
Langda

643
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,099
Langda

644
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,099
What is in your heart?...
Tell me

645
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,099
No... not special

646
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:22,099
Actually, the Dolly is very beautiful
and we know Kesu

647
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:26,099
So sometimes l do think that

648
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:32,099
That may be they could have been
special friends in their college time

649
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:39,099
No... No... lt is not possible
Disgusting

650
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:43,099
But Kesu

651
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,099
He is a very handsome boy

652
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:49,099
But sometimes seems hypersexual

653
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:55,099
l suggest brother we should observe the Dolly
till the wedding ceremony

654
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,099
The world is very bitter sometime

655
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:08,000
And our Dolly Sis. is very innocent

656
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:11,099
Put all the substances in.

657
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:21,000
ls it original?

658
01:24:55,000 --> 01:25:04,000
Run away... ..hurry up

659
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:38,099
CM... my son CM

660
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:43,099
You should wait at least till election

661
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:47,099
They will consider us to be dumb
if we kept quiet

662
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:54,099
lndur Singh's pitcher has been completly filled

663
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:58,099
Okay

664
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:03,099
But You will do nothing till your wedding

665
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:07,099
marriage

666
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,099
30th of next month is the fortunate day

667
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:12,099

l told him

669
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:22,099
You people ran so quickly that we just
kept crying to know what happened

670
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,099
Then we called Kesu

671
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:35,000
And have come straight here

672
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:46,000

673
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:04,099
First Kichlo, then lndur Singh

674
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:09,099
Langda will go to City
in attempt to depress Kichlo

675
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,099

741
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:59,099
and said don't be afraid it must be

And really it was she our Billo

743
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:09,099
And she was in anger like Ramjee

744

And a little bastard as well

749

lt was winter night and Kesu was
on fire but Billo did not
let him touch her

750
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,099
Then Kesu took out jewellery from a box

751
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:45,099
A big briasllet for her waist

752
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:47,099
Sparklling one

753

That kind of beautiful thing
I have never seen before

754
01:40:57,000 --> 01:41:01,099
lt was so sparkalling that it was shinnig
so much on her waist that one did not
need any electricity in the room

755
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:02,099
Then!

756
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:12,000
Then what? After this nothing was on top
of waist nor down and Kesu got started

757
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,099

764
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:40,099

That Braisllet

770
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,099
Should be here somewhere

771
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:07,099
Here or somewhere else

772
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:11,099

Whome I will give gift, Omkara?

Who else is there in my life?

783
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:57,000
For you I have left all the world

784
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,099
* A log burns and becomes coal

785
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:17,000
* Coal becomes dust

786
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:19,099
* A log burns and becomes coal

787
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:29,000
* Coal becomes dust

788
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:35,099
* But when the heart burns nothing happens

789
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:42,099
* There’s no smoke, no ashes

790
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:50,099
* Don’t let your heart burn

791
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:57,099
* Don’t let your heart burn

792
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:07,000
* Don’t give your heart away

793
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:17,000

That you should let your man be a little
starvy and thrusty it is important

All time his father's voice

02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:38,099

983
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:42,000
Was something less between us?

984
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:50,099
Omi Brother!
Omi Brother!

985

Outside something bad has happend

986
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:39,099
How innocent she seems while sleeping

987
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:49,000
Nor she was her father's nor mine

988
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:07,000

Pick up your gun
and relase me from this pain

996
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:49,099
You will get realsed from your body but...

1003
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:46,099
* and still I am, am I not?

1004
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:49,099

1005
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:51,099

1012
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:40,099
* Listen to it and wake up

1013
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:46,099

* (like King Dashrath known for his word)

1016
02:25:57,000 --> 02:26:01,099
* Get rid of the night in your eyes

1017
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:04,099

Was l that cheap in your eyes Omi Brother?

1021
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:12,099
lf you said one more thing
then the story ends

1022
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:22,000
ls there something else to be finished

1023
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:40,099
Yes there is,

1024
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:46,099
Remember how I killed Wajay in court?

1025
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:51,099
On his brain

1026
02:27:52,000 --> 02:28:01,000
And lndhu Singh in his mouth

1027
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:06,086
And remember Dhakur

1028
02:28:06,087 --> 02:28:15,087
ln his heart...
