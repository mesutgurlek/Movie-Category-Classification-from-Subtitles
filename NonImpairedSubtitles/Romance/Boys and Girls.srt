4
00:01:37,538 --> 00:01:40,006
Everytime we fIy

5
00:01:41,375 --> 00:01:45,368
-We better not miss our connection.
-We onIy have two hours.

6
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:49,745
-Can I heIp you?
-I don't know. Can you?

7
00:01:50,851 --> 00:01:55,185
-May I heIp you?
-Why are we behind scheduIe?

8
00:01:55,489 --> 00:01:58,424
Just a few more minutes.
Can I get you something to drink?

9
00:01:58,626 --> 00:02:00,924
I don't know.
Can you?

10
00:02:05,066 --> 00:02:07,057
Right this way.

11

-Thanks.

12
00:02:12,707 --> 00:02:15,267

00:02:15,676 --> 00:02:20,238
-Wait tiII the Iast minute to pack?
-Nope. Got my first period.

14
00:02:21,482 --> 00:02:24,076
Goodafternoon,everyone.
This isyourcaptainagain.

15
00:02:24,285 --> 00:02:28,779
We're makingourwayout and
we'lltake offshortly. Enjoyit.

16
00:02:29,223 --> 00:02:32,488
Does it gross you out to know
that I'm bIeeding right now?

17
00:02:32,693 --> 00:02:35,526
-Why shouId it? It 's just bioIogy.
-We couId have sex right now...

18
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:38,324
and I wouIdn't get pregnant.

19
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,267
-Do you have orgasms?
-That 's none of your business!

20
00:02:43,471 --> 00:02:47,271
-You're stiII young. Are you ten?
-12.

21
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:52,611
-Do you Iive in LA or New York?
-LA.

22
00:02:52,813 --> 00:02:56,806
Me too. My dad ran off, so my
mom and I moved to CaIifornia.

23
00:02:57,952 --> 00:03:00,853
-Your parents stiII together?
-No. Yes!

24
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:03,990
-What 's that mean?
-They are getting back together.

25
00:03:04,191 --> 00:03:07,888
-That 's great.
-Yeah, I have it aII pIanned out.

26
00:03:08,095 --> 00:03:11,030
-You're getting them back together?
-I've aIready taIked to my father.

27
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:14,724
And I'm gonna expIain to my mother
how the divorce is ruining my Iife.

28
00:03:15,002 --> 00:03:17,664
-Maybe they're not in Iove anymore.
-You have to work at Iove...

29
00:03:17,872 --> 00:03:20,568
...if you want it to Iast forever.
-Who says Iove shouId Iast forever?

30
00:03:20,775 --> 00:03:22,265
-They're married!
-They're divorced!

31
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:25,502
They shared vows, made commitment.
They have responsibiIities!

32
00:03:25,646 --> 00:03:29,173
-Someone needs to remind them!
-My mother says, if Iove is broken...

33
00:03:29,383 --> 00:03:32,875
...you just have to throw it out.
-That 's what 's wrong with grown-ups.

34
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:35,817
-They're Iazy.
-You're an idiot!

35
00:03:36,023 --> 00:03:38,514
-You're an idiot!
-You're ugIy!

36
00:03:47,735 --> 00:03:52,035
Try breathing. Take a deep breath.
It 'II heIp you reIax.

37
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,298
I'm not not-reIaxed.

38
00:03:55,042 --> 00:03:57,135
This is just how I am.

39
00:03:57,344 --> 00:04:02,304
One, two, three, four, five...

40
00:04:02,683 --> 00:04:05,982
six, seven, eight, nine...

41
00:04:21,936 --> 00:04:23,597
HaIftime!

42
00:04:23,804 --> 00:04:28,537
That'shalftime, with the Knights
leadingthe Gophers 14 to 7.

43
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:32,640

47
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:48,326
Bow down to my
queen and king!

48
00:04:48,529 --> 00:04:51,555
-Jennifer Burrows?
-Gopher!

49
00:04:51,932 --> 00:04:54,366
Do you mock my queen?

50
00:04:55,536 --> 00:05:00,599
I thinketh that you do!
And for that you shaII die.

51
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:11,415
Die!

52
00:05:13,754 --> 00:05:15,881
Die, Gopher!

53
00:05:26,667 --> 00:05:31,195
-Run the head over!
-No. No, don't!

54
00:05:36,443 --> 00:05:39,742
-Are you aII right?
-My head.

55
00:05:39,947 --> 00:05:45,385
-You're gonna be okay.
-No, my head. Where is it?

56
00:06:07,775 --> 00:06:10,175
How's your head?

57
00:06:11,212 --> 00:06:12,702
Not so good.

58
00:06:13,681 --> 00:06:15,842
I'm so sorry.

59
00:06:18,352 --> 00:06:21,048
You don't remember me, do you?

60
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:26,583
-No. ShouId I?
-No.

61
00:06:27,761 --> 00:06:30,229
We were on a pIane
together once.

62
00:06:33,067 --> 00:06:36,696
My God! Ryan?

63
00:06:37,104 --> 00:06:39,732
You're Counting Ryan?

64
00:06:40,307 --> 00:06:44,107
Of course I remember you.
Once a month I remember you.

65
00:06:44,311 --> 00:06:47,872
I must have toId that period on the
pIane story, Iike, a miIIion times.

66
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:52,647
-Not me.
-You wanna go grab a coffee?

67
00:06:53,053 --> 00:06:55,954
What about your boyfriend,
the king?

68
00:06:56,156 --> 00:06:59,284
I don't have a boyfriend.
Hate commitments.

69
00:06:59,493 --> 00:07:03,429
Why Iimit yourseIf when there's
aworId of possibiIities out there?

70
00:07:04,398 --> 00:07:07,697
Maybe aII those possibiIities
distract you from what you want.

71
00:07:07,902 --> 00:07:10,700
-That 's why I don't watch cabIe.
-What?

72
00:07:10,938 --> 00:07:15,102
-There's too many choices.
-LuckiIy your schooI has uniform.

73
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:20,479
You might have to pick out an outfit,
and with aII the choices...

74
00:07:20,681 --> 00:07:23,411
you might end up waIking
out of your house naked.

75
00:07:24,051 --> 00:07:27,714
-That 's dumb.
-Yeah, you're pretty dumb.

76
00:07:27,922 --> 00:07:31,153
-Don't caII me dumb!
-Why not? It 's true.

77
00:07:31,358 --> 00:07:35,761
You are, you're dumb.
Dumb, dumb, dumb!

78
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:39,193
No. You're dumb!

79
00:07:44,171 --> 00:07:47,072
-So you wanna go?
-No!

80
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:51,808
-Why not?
-Because this... us...

81
00:07:53,047 --> 00:07:55,538
-We don't cIick.
-Since when?

82
00:07:55,749 --> 00:07:59,378
Since now. Right now!
Does this feeI Iike we're cIicking?!

83
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:03,179
I was onIy taIking about
getting a cup of coffee.

84
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:07,986
-Maybe decaf for you.
-It just doesn't make sense to me.

85
00:08:09,663 --> 00:08:12,496
-Fine.
-Fine.

86
00:08:38,404 --> 00:08:41,771
-What time is it?
-Time for me to Ieave for the airport.

87
00:08:41,974 --> 00:08:45,535
ImpossibIe. I set my aIarm exactIy
one minute before you had to Ieave.

88
00:08:45,911 --> 00:08:48,846
I set mine three minutes
before, just to be sure.

89
00:08:49,615 --> 00:08:52,277
-I Iove you.
-I Iove you.

90
00:08:52,918 --> 00:08:55,614
-Gopher boy?
-What 's wrong?

91
00:08:55,821 --> 00:08:57,948
-Nothing.
-It is you.

92
00:08:58,157 --> 00:09:00,955
I don't beIieve it.
Are you going to schooI here?

93
00:09:02,094 --> 00:09:03,823
Yes.

94
00:09:05,197 --> 00:09:09,896
-This is Betty. Betty, this is...
-Jennifer. Hi, how are you doing?

95
00:09:10,102 --> 00:09:14,562
-Gopher boy and I go way back.
-PIease stop caIIing me that.

96
00:09:14,773 --> 00:09:16,536
Okay.

97
00:09:17,843 --> 00:09:22,644
WeII, I guess I shouId get going.
It was good seeing you again.

98
00:09:25,451 --> 00:09:28,614
-''Gopher boy''?
-It 's a Iong story.

99
00:09:40,966 --> 00:09:43,491
HeIp!
Is somebody there?

100
00:09:43,836 --> 00:09:47,363
A IittIe heIp here, pIease!
Somebody. HeIIo?

101
00:09:49,808 --> 00:09:52,174
Excuse me.
HeIIo!

102
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:02,080
-Are you aII right?
-I'm fine.

103
00:10:02,288 --> 00:10:05,416
-You're Ryan, right?
-Yeah.

104
00:10:05,624 --> 00:10:08,821
I'm Hunter, your roomie.

105
00:10:09,361 --> 00:10:12,524
-What were you doing in the trunk?
-Right.

106
00:10:12,731 --> 00:10:17,498
WeII, I got to the room first
here before you...

107
00:10:17,703 --> 00:10:23,938
and I thought it wouId be funny if
I popped out and surprised you.

108
00:10:24,143 --> 00:10:28,239
Surprise!
And the rest is history.

109
00:10:28,447 --> 00:10:31,280
We haven't even known
each other for 2O seconds...

110
00:10:31,483 --> 00:10:34,247
and aIready we have astory.
This is gonna be great.

111
00:10:34,453 --> 00:10:36,683
-So, how are you gonna teII it?
-TeII what?

112
00:10:36,889 --> 00:10:39,289
Our story.
I know.

113
00:10:39,491 --> 00:10:42,790
You'II say I was gasping for air,
and you saved my Iife.

114
00:10:42,995 --> 00:10:45,759
-WeII, I...
-That 's a great way to teII it.

115
00:10:45,964 --> 00:10:49,161
Chicks Iove drama.
You're good, man.

116
00:10:50,969 --> 00:10:54,029
-Thanks.
-ReaIIy good!

117
00:10:54,273 --> 00:10:58,642
I'm gonna have a hard time
keeping up with you. Come here.

118
00:11:00,245 --> 00:11:01,974
Man!

119
00:11:02,548 --> 00:11:04,573
Four years.

120
00:11:22,468 --> 00:11:25,164
So is she your
high-schooI sweetheart?

121
00:11:25,371 --> 00:11:29,501
-As a matter of fact, she is.
-Good for you.

122
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:33,109
-Where's she going to schooI?
-SeattIe.

123
00:11:33,712 --> 00:11:37,409
-God. Long distance.
-So?

124
00:11:37,616 --> 00:11:40,050
-Good Iuck.
-We don't need Iuck.

125
00:11:40,252 --> 00:11:43,153
We have astrong reIationship. We
weren't together over the summer...

126
00:11:43,355 --> 00:11:45,823
and everything was fine.

127
00:11:46,258 --> 00:11:49,716
-What was she gone? A month?
-Six weeks, two days.

128
00:11:49,928 --> 00:11:53,728
You visited back and forth maybe 3
times, caIIed each other every night?

129
00:11:53,932 --> 00:11:58,699
-Right. You have to put in the work.
-I've seen it happen a hundred times.

130
00:11:58,904 --> 00:12:01,896
Last year, every Iong-distance
reIationship in my dorm...

131
00:12:02,107 --> 00:12:05,042
was over by the
second semester.

132
00:12:05,244 --> 00:12:08,304
-Just keeping it reaI.
-Next in Iine, pIease.

133
00:12:08,514 --> 00:12:11,483
-So where are you Iiving?
-Herman HaII.

134
00:12:11,683 --> 00:12:14,550
-I can give you some tips.
-Do you Iive there?

135
00:12:14,753 --> 00:12:19,315
No, but I do have friends there.
I Iive off-campus with my boyfriend.

136
00:12:19,525 --> 00:12:22,892
What?
You have a boyfriend?

137
00:12:23,862 --> 00:12:27,855
-Who?
-MichaeI Winters, he's a musician.

138
00:12:28,066 --> 00:12:31,900
-He's great.
-You're Iiving with one guy?

139
00:12:32,538 --> 00:12:37,066
You've made a commitment that
prohibits choices in the name of Iove?

140
00:12:37,276 --> 00:12:40,973
Isn't it crazy what faIIing head
over heeIs can do to a person?

141
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:44,343
-Next, pIease.
-That 's me.

142
00:12:51,256 --> 00:12:55,488
I came as fast as I couId.
What happened?

143
00:12:55,828 --> 00:12:58,695
-He dumped me!
-Why?

144
00:12:58,897 --> 00:13:02,765
-He feII in Iove with somebody eIse!
-God. Who?

145
00:13:02,968 --> 00:13:07,462
I don't know who and I don't care!
The point is that he dumped me!

146
00:13:07,706 --> 00:13:11,073
How did you find out? I mean,
did you catch them or something?

147
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:14,837
-God. In this bed?
-No!

148
00:13:15,047 --> 00:13:19,108
God! No, no!
He just toId me!

149
00:13:19,351 --> 00:13:21,785
-He toId you?
-Yeah. We made that whoIe pact...

150
00:13:21,987 --> 00:13:24,751
that if you meet somebody eIse
you teII the other person.

151
00:13:24,957 --> 00:13:29,189
No one ever takes that seriousIy.
You say it to cover your own ass.

152
00:13:29,394 --> 00:13:34,161
I'm reaIIy Iucky because my boyfriend
is reaIIy IoyaI to his pacts.

153
00:13:34,366 --> 00:13:36,994
-How did you find out?
-At the cIub.

154
00:13:37,202 --> 00:13:41,434
-Did he yeII it over the music?
-No, no. It was the music.

155
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:45,576
-No!
-Yeah. The same cIub where we met.

156
00:13:45,777 --> 00:13:49,338
It was the same cIub where we first
decided to move in together.

157
00:13:49,548 --> 00:13:54,110
The same stage where he first sang
''Jennifer, This Heart Is Made For 2''.

158
00:13:54,319 --> 00:13:57,846
And I'm sitting there, watching him,
and thinking how much I Iove him...

159
00:13:58,056 --> 00:14:01,651
and how I can't beIieve that
I can Iove somebody that much.

160
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:05,387
And then he sang this brand-new
song, a IittIe something caIIed...

161
00:14:05,597 --> 00:14:10,534
Jennifer,Jennifer
Youaskedme to be true

162
00:14:10,736 --> 00:14:16,072
What canlsay?
lfoundsomeone new

163
00:14:18,544 --> 00:14:21,172
That 's horribIe.

164
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:23,941
ActuaIIy,
it was pretty catchy.

165
00:14:24,149 --> 00:14:27,414
By the second chorus,
everybody was singing aIong.

166
00:14:27,619 --> 00:14:30,588
-What did you do?
-Nothing.

167
00:14:30,923 --> 00:14:35,860
I don't think I've ever feIt this way
before. I'm a compIete idiot!

168
00:14:36,061 --> 00:14:39,497
Why didn't I Iisten to my instincts,
you know what I mean?

169
00:14:39,698 --> 00:14:44,431
Hey, Iook on the bright side.
Now you get to move in with me.

170
00:14:45,804 --> 00:14:50,332
I know things Iook pretty horribIe,
but it 's just gonna take some time.

171
00:14:50,542 --> 00:14:54,308
-That 's what my therapist says.
-To heII with your therapist, Amy.

172
00:14:54,513 --> 00:14:57,573
Because I just need
to feeI better. Now!

173
00:15:00,485 --> 00:15:03,511
''Doo doo be doo'' my ass!

174
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:08,055
It 's tough out there, man.
You don't know how Iucky you are.

175
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:10,785
-Betty and I broke up.
-What?

176
00:15:10,996 --> 00:15:13,590
-You're kidding. When?
-A coupIe of days ago.

177
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:16,063
-Why didn't you teII me?
-I don't know.

178
00:15:16,268 --> 00:15:19,169
I guess it 's just now
kindasinking in.

179
00:15:19,371 --> 00:15:22,499
This is great news.
Now you and ''me'' can hit the circuit.

180
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:24,198
-''You and I''.
-Right.

181
00:15:24,409 --> 00:15:26,536
-I don't think so.
-No, beIieve me.

182
00:15:26,745 --> 00:15:30,613
It 's way easier with two of us.
You pretend to be my idiot cousin.

183
00:15:30,816 --> 00:15:34,718
AII of asudden, I'm sensitive.
You get drunk, come out too strong...

184
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,753
I beat the shit out of you,
I'm masculine.

185
00:15:39,224 --> 00:15:41,715
-I don't think I'm ready for that.
-We couId trade off.

186
00:15:41,927 --> 00:15:44,828
-You can hit me first if you want.
-It was two days ago.

187
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:47,590
-I think I need a IittIe time.
-I'm sorry. You're hurting.

188
00:15:47,799 --> 00:15:50,529
-Let 's get drunk and see strippers.
-I'm not that hurt!

189
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:54,430
-PIease.
-I'm fine.

190
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:57,609
Breaking up was the right thing
to do. We were just...

191
00:15:57,809 --> 00:16:00,141
going in different directions.

192
00:16:03,081 --> 00:16:05,311
-Hit me.
-No!

193
00:16:05,517 --> 00:16:08,577
-Hurry, before she Ieaves.
-Who?

194
00:16:15,594 --> 00:16:17,653
-You know her?
-Kind of.

195
00:16:17,863 --> 00:16:19,956
-Okay, then I'II hit you.
-No!

196
00:16:23,769 --> 00:16:26,704
-How you been?
-Good. You?

197
00:16:26,905 --> 00:16:28,497
Great.

198
00:16:28,707 --> 00:16:31,801
-So I see you're aII settIed in.
-Yes.

199
00:16:32,044 --> 00:16:35,172
-Did you get Fridays off?
-Yes.

200
00:16:35,647 --> 00:16:39,845
-I got Friday nights off.
-I'm sure you do.

201
00:16:41,253 --> 00:16:44,950
-Jennifer, this is Hunter.
-Hi.

202
00:16:46,825 --> 00:16:50,693
WeII, I'd Iove to
stick around...

203
00:16:50,896 --> 00:16:55,595
but I have to go to the station to
pick up my cousin. He's an idiot.

204
00:16:55,801 --> 00:16:58,736
My whoIe famiIy is, actuaIIy.
Me too.

205
00:17:00,005 --> 00:17:04,908
Yeah, me too. I'm an idiot.
I'II see you.

206
00:17:08,146 --> 00:17:10,137
I got dumped.

207
00:17:10,348 --> 00:17:13,681
Music man. MichaeI.
Dumped me.

208
00:17:16,855 --> 00:17:18,789
How's Iong-distance Betty?

209
00:17:19,524 --> 00:17:23,051
-I don't wanna taIk about it.
-I just toId you about my breakup.

210
00:17:23,261 --> 00:17:26,822
-I mean, it couIdn't be worse.
-Why do you wanna know?

211
00:17:27,032 --> 00:17:32,129
-Misery Ioves company.
-No, you'II use it against me.

212
00:17:32,637 --> 00:17:37,074
Okay, maybe I might have done that
in the past, but I've changed.

213
00:17:37,275 --> 00:17:40,938
I have. I'm scarred now and
I Iook at Iife very differentIy.

214
00:17:43,482 --> 00:17:45,313
Okay.

215
00:17:46,685 --> 00:17:49,711
-You were right.
-The Iong-distance thing. I knew it.

216
00:17:49,921 --> 00:17:53,789
But not for me! I was fine with it.
I wouId go there, she wouId come here.

217
00:17:53,992 --> 00:17:57,086
If I toId her I'd caII her a certain
time, no matter where I was...

218
00:17:57,295 --> 00:17:58,922
-You wouId caII.
-...I wouId caII!

219
00:17:59,131 --> 00:18:02,828
If I toId her to caII me at a certain
time, I wouId aIways be home.

220
00:18:03,034 --> 00:18:06,697
I mean, I Ioved her. None of that
ever seemed Iike work to me.

221
00:18:06,905 --> 00:18:10,363
-But it did to her, right?
-Yeah.

222
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:15,974
This one weekend, I was down there,
we were kissing each other goodbye...

223
00:18:16,181 --> 00:18:21,016
and her room-mate came by with her
boyfriend, both carrying Iaundry.

224
00:18:21,686 --> 00:18:23,847
And Betty just started crying.

225
00:18:24,055 --> 00:18:26,649
I asked her, ''What 's wrong?''
She said:

226
00:18:26,858 --> 00:18:29,383
We never get to do
our Iaundry together.

227
00:18:29,995 --> 00:18:34,864
She was right. We never did our
Iaundry together, and that was it.

228
00:18:35,066 --> 00:18:37,398
You broke up
because of Iaundry?

229
00:18:38,503 --> 00:18:42,564
-I send mine out.
-Not Iaundry exactIy.

230
00:18:42,774 --> 00:18:46,835
Just aII the things that coupIes
do together and shouId do together.

231
00:18:47,045 --> 00:18:50,776
We didn't have the time anymore.
She couIdn't handIe that.

232
00:18:50,982 --> 00:18:53,473
-Why didn't you move there?
-SchoIarship.

233
00:18:53,685 --> 00:18:56,620
-She couId've moved here.
-Scholarship.

234
00:18:56,822 --> 00:18:59,382
-So that was it?
-Yeah.

235
00:18:59,591 --> 00:19:02,424
-She needed what I couIdn't give her.
-No.

236
00:19:02,627 --> 00:19:07,860
There's a Iot of other things. Too
many differences make it impossibIe.

237
00:19:08,066 --> 00:19:10,899
MichaeI and I didn't
agree on anything. Ever.

238
00:19:11,102 --> 00:19:14,071
That 's what I Ioved about it.
We fought, shouted...

239
00:19:14,272 --> 00:19:17,332
had sex... That 's what I miss!

240
00:19:17,609 --> 00:19:21,511
-That doesn't sound very heaIthy.
-But what do you know about it?

241
00:19:21,713 --> 00:19:24,876
-Excuse me?
-Who are you to judge me?

242
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:27,778
-See? I knew this was a mistake!
-What?

243
00:19:27,986 --> 00:19:30,819
I'm just saying that you were
in an unheaIthy reIationship.

244
00:19:31,022 --> 00:19:34,287
It isn't about having to Iike things
aII the time. It 's about surprises!

245
00:19:35,026 --> 00:19:38,427
Love's exciting and it 's thriIIing
and it drives you so insane...

246
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:41,827
that you think you're gonna expIode!
That 's the whoIe point.

247
00:19:42,701 --> 00:19:45,966
Then, I guess MichaeI
didn't get the point.

248
00:20:02,454 --> 00:20:05,548
You've never been to her apartment?
That 's some weird shit.

249
00:20:05,757 --> 00:20:07,816
No, it 's not!

250
00:20:09,728 --> 00:20:14,495
She's just being carefuI. There's no
point introducing me into her worId...

251
00:20:14,699 --> 00:20:18,465
unIess she feeIs secure in
our reIationship. I admire that.

252
00:20:20,705 --> 00:20:23,139
What are you doing today?

253
00:20:23,341 --> 00:20:25,935
I've got ascuba diving
cIass at three.

254
00:20:26,678 --> 00:20:28,612
ReaIIy?

255
00:20:29,714 --> 00:20:33,878
No, that 's a Iie. I Iied. I can't stop.
I'm Iying about everything!

256
00:20:34,119 --> 00:20:37,782
It started so I can impress girIs.
And now I can't stop.

257
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:43,059
-You shouId see someone about that.
-Yeah, I am.

258
00:20:43,895 --> 00:20:47,888
-No, you're not!
-See? I can't stop! I can't!

259
00:20:48,099 --> 00:20:50,067
TeII you what. The next time
I catch you Iying...

260
00:20:50,268 --> 00:20:52,793
I'II expose you for
the fraud that you are.

261
00:20:53,004 --> 00:20:55,302
-You wouIdn't.
-I wouId.

262
00:20:56,474 --> 00:20:59,170
-You're not Iying.
-I'm not.

263
00:21:02,447 --> 00:21:05,974
-What are you reaIIy doing today?
-Dance cIass.

264
00:21:08,853 --> 00:21:11,981
So my therapist keeps teIIing me
to expand my horizons...

265
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:15,182
but with this guy aII I did was
pretend to be someone I wasn't.

266
00:21:15,393 --> 00:21:18,851
-And I can't handIe it anymore.
-So you're breaking up with him.

267
00:21:19,064 --> 00:21:22,090
Yeah, but do you think
I'm being too cowardIy?

268
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:25,463
My therapist wants me to take more
responsibiIity for my emotions...

269
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:28,639
but I just don't think this is the
right time for that, you know?

270
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:32,332
It doesn't matter how you do it.
Phone, fax, e-maiI, song...

271
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:35,069
it 's aII the same message:
''Adios, amigo''.

272
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,942
Okay, but you have
to be nice about it.

273
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:42,680
Amy, are you breaking up
with your boyfriend, or am I?

274
00:21:42,887 --> 00:21:46,846
I wouIdn't caII him my boyfriend.
I bareIy know the guy.

275
00:21:47,058 --> 00:21:49,549
-So don't worry about it.
-Yeah, but he just seems so sweet.

276
00:21:49,761 --> 00:21:52,059
-I don't wannasee him get hurt.
-I know.

277
00:22:12,717 --> 00:22:15,151
What are you doing here?

278
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,750
I was coming to pick up Amy.

279
00:22:21,026 --> 00:22:23,153
Interesting.

280
00:22:23,528 --> 00:22:27,123
-What are you doing here?
-I'm Amy's room-mate.

281
00:22:30,535 --> 00:22:34,369
-Is she here?
-We need to taIk.

282
00:22:34,572 --> 00:22:37,473
-We're not right together?!
-I'm teIIing you what she toId me.

283
00:22:37,675 --> 00:22:40,803
-You shouIdn't take it personaIIy.
-Why do peopIe say that?

284
00:22:41,012 --> 00:22:43,572
How can I not take it personaIIy?
It 's me she doesn't Iike!

285
00:22:43,782 --> 00:22:47,411
-Okay, fine. Take it personally.
-Why didn't she teII me?

286
00:22:47,619 --> 00:22:49,951
-She didn't want to hurt you.
-And you did?!

287
00:22:50,155 --> 00:22:52,146
No. I didn't know it was you.

288
00:22:52,357 --> 00:22:55,451
I knew it was a Ryan, but I
didn't know it was you, Ryan.

289
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:58,754
-WeII, this sucks!
-''NoIi nuntium necare''.

290
00:22:58,963 --> 00:23:01,261
-What?
-Latin. ''Don't kiII the messenger''.

291
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:04,124
You know what?7
You're having too much fun with this.

292
00:23:04,335 --> 00:23:06,303
I'm trying not to!

293
00:23:06,504 --> 00:23:08,563
Try harder!

294
00:23:13,411 --> 00:23:15,345
Look, it 's not funny.

295
00:23:15,547 --> 00:23:19,916
I'm not Iaughing at you. Chicks
Iove making us jump through hoops.

296
00:23:20,118 --> 00:23:23,485
-This isn't a hoop. We broke up!
-No, it 's a test.

297
00:23:23,688 --> 00:23:26,384
She's testing you to see
how much you reaIIy want her.

298
00:23:26,591 --> 00:23:29,116
-You think?
-I know.

299
00:23:29,327 --> 00:23:32,558
You've gottaswim across the moat,
bust down the castIe door...

300
00:23:32,764 --> 00:23:37,201
sIay the dragon. No euphemism.
And sweep her off her feet.

301
00:23:37,402 --> 00:23:39,063
-You're right!
-Of course I am.

302
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:41,966
You're absoIuteIy right! We were great
together. I even made a chart!

303
00:23:42,173 --> 00:23:44,437
-I'm sure you did.
-It proved how perfect we were.

304
00:23:44,642 --> 00:23:47,110
Now aII I have to do
is prove it to Amy.

305
00:23:47,312 --> 00:23:51,009
-What?
-You've gotta do more than that.

306
00:23:51,216 --> 00:23:55,585
-You've gottaweep. OpenIy.
-You should've quit while ahead.

307
00:23:55,787 --> 00:23:59,780
Squeeze the Iids. Turn on the
sprinkIers. You need the tears...

308
00:23:59,991 --> 00:24:03,950
of a man who can't breathe another
second without the Iove of his Iife.

309
00:24:04,162 --> 00:24:05,823
HoId on.

310
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:08,521
I got just the thing. Here.

311
00:24:08,733 --> 00:24:10,792
-What 's this?
-Icy BaIm.

312
00:24:11,002 --> 00:24:14,961
A IittIe dab under your eyes,
you'II sob Iike a miss America.

313
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:19,499
Wish me Iuck.
Today I Iearn second position.

314
00:24:19,711 --> 00:24:21,508
Ladies!

315
00:24:28,019 --> 00:24:31,648
Do you know that they rearranged
aII the desks in the Iibrary?

316
00:24:31,856 --> 00:24:34,848
-No!
-Yeah. It 's compIeteIy different.

317
00:24:35,059 --> 00:24:39,291
I spent 2 hours to find my desk, and
if it wasn't for the Diet Coke stain...

318
00:24:39,497 --> 00:24:43,558
I wouIdn't have found it at aII.
They put it on the third fIoor.

319
00:24:43,768 --> 00:24:49,138
Not the second, not the fourth.
The third. Number three.

320
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:53,367
-And that wouId be a bad thing?
-PIease. It 's a disaster!

321
00:24:56,214 --> 00:25:00,446
-You wanna hear about the breakup?
-I totaIIy forgot. Was it horribIe?

322
00:25:00,652 --> 00:25:04,110
-You think we can stiII be friends?
-I don't know. He seemed shook up.

323
00:25:04,622 --> 00:25:06,453
-Poor guy.
-Wanna hear the weird part?

324
00:25:06,791 --> 00:25:08,281
-I kinda know him.
-You do?

325
00:25:08,493 --> 00:25:10,358
Yeah, we run into each other
once in awhiIe.

326
00:25:10,728 --> 00:25:13,390
Do you think I did the right thing
in having you break up with him?

327
00:25:13,598 --> 00:25:15,498
-I don't know.
-I do.

328
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:18,260
It was just putting
too much pressure on me.

329
00:25:18,469 --> 00:25:22,963
-Yeah, I can see that.
-But maybe that 's what I need.

330
00:25:23,274 --> 00:25:25,265
What if that 's him?

331
00:25:48,199 --> 00:25:51,134
My God, you're crying!
He's crying!

332
00:25:51,836 --> 00:25:56,398
Why are you doing this to me?
It 's over. Do you understand me?

333
00:25:57,875 --> 00:26:02,505
Ryan? Ryan! It 's not so bad.
PeopIe break up aII the time.

334
00:26:02,714 --> 00:26:04,773
I can't see!

335
00:26:05,683 --> 00:26:07,981
I think I'm bIind!

336
00:26:15,426 --> 00:26:17,553
Nice patch.

337
00:26:17,762 --> 00:26:21,960
-Thanks. You didn't have to wait.
-I'm not waiting.

338
00:26:22,166 --> 00:26:27,263
Can't a girI enjoy a IoIIipop in
front of the Free HeaIth Center?

339
00:26:30,942 --> 00:26:35,072
Who also feels maybe
a little bit responsibIe.

340
00:26:35,313 --> 00:26:36,940
You didn't do anything.

341
00:26:37,181 --> 00:26:41,481
I didn't put the Icy BaIm in your
eye, but I did break up with you.

342
00:26:41,686 --> 00:26:44,484
-Remember?
-Yep.

343
00:26:47,358 --> 00:26:49,792
-Where are you going?
-For awaIk.

344
00:26:49,994 --> 00:26:53,452
-Try to forget today ever happened.
-Can I come?

345
00:26:53,665 --> 00:26:55,462
What for?

346
00:26:56,034 --> 00:27:00,027
Can't a girI enjoy awaIk
with her ex-boyfriend?

347
00:27:00,238 --> 00:27:03,435
WiII the girI continue to refer
to herseIf in the third person?

348
00:27:03,641 --> 00:27:07,737
-Did Ryan WaIker just make ajoke?
-I don't know. Let me ask him.

349
00:27:07,945 --> 00:27:10,914
You know, you're pretty funny
when you're depressed.

350
00:27:11,115 --> 00:27:14,380
-WeII, get ready for comedy.
-Another one!

351
00:27:14,619 --> 00:27:18,953
A few more, I'II take you back to
the cIinic to fix your busted gut.

352
00:27:19,157 --> 00:27:21,250
-You Iost it.
-Not funny?

353
00:27:21,459 --> 00:27:26,920
Let 's put it this way: anymore
of those, and we'II break again.

354
00:27:34,872 --> 00:27:40,469
Come on, this is it!
Round arms! Seven! Eight!

355
00:27:41,312 --> 00:27:43,906
-How's it going?
-Get ready!

356
00:27:44,215 --> 00:27:46,843
EIeven, ready spiraI!

357
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:55,958
How are you doing?

358
00:28:06,371 --> 00:28:07,861
Other way.

359
00:28:09,407 --> 00:28:11,204
PuII out!

360
00:28:11,409 --> 00:28:15,869
Excuse me. Question:
ExactIy how far can you bend over?

361
00:28:18,216 --> 00:28:21,652
-Do you come here a Iot?
-Yeah.

362
00:28:21,853 --> 00:28:26,256
-It 's reaIIy beautifuI.
-One of the greatest achievements.

363
00:28:26,457 --> 00:28:30,154
You're the second person
to caII me that this week.

364
00:28:30,762 --> 00:28:36,029
-You know the onIy way to buiId it?
-AIien sIaves from outer space?

365
00:28:36,834 --> 00:28:41,066
Perfect pIanning.
And doesn't it make so much sense?

366
00:28:41,272 --> 00:28:45,766
You examine asituation, you pIan
a course of action, you execute it.

367
00:28:46,244 --> 00:28:48,542
And everything works out fine.

368
00:28:50,848 --> 00:28:53,180
But it doesn't.

369
00:28:54,018 --> 00:28:59,388
WeII, that 's because most things
in Iife just aren't that simpIe.

370
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:01,717
Does that Iook simpIe to you?

371
00:29:01,926 --> 00:29:05,327
You can't imagine how compIicated
something Iike that is to create.

372
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:08,931
-I thought you used it as a metaphor.
-I did.

373
00:29:09,133 --> 00:29:11,727
-For a reIationship.
-Yes.

374
00:29:12,069 --> 00:29:15,061
-Yeah, that 's what I thought.
-I mean...

375
00:29:15,273 --> 00:29:18,299
I know I didn't know
Amy incredibIy weII...

376
00:29:18,509 --> 00:29:21,069
but it just feIt Iike
everything added up.

377
00:29:21,312 --> 00:29:26,477
-Are you a Math major?
-No, StructuraI Engineering.

378
00:29:27,585 --> 00:29:30,145
-I'm done with it.
-Engineering?

379
00:29:30,354 --> 00:29:32,515
ReIationships.

380
00:29:33,224 --> 00:29:37,422
They're just too much.
It 's not worth it.

381
00:29:37,628 --> 00:29:39,619
''Assentior''.

382
00:29:39,864 --> 00:29:43,732
-I hear you, brother. Latin.
-What is it with the Latin?

383
00:29:43,935 --> 00:29:45,402
-My major.
-Latin?

384
00:29:45,603 --> 00:29:46,797
-Yeah.
-Why?

385
00:29:47,004 --> 00:29:49,165
-Why not?
-What are you gonna do with it?

386
00:29:49,373 --> 00:29:51,773
I'm going to ItaIy for
my graduate schooI!

387
00:29:51,976 --> 00:29:54,171
And after that?

388
00:29:54,912 --> 00:29:56,777
I don't know.

389
00:29:56,981 --> 00:30:01,475
See? You're amazing.
I couId never do that.

390
00:30:01,686 --> 00:30:05,087
-You mean not have a pIan?
-Or something.

391
00:30:07,325 --> 00:30:12,422
But... then again, why wouId
you ever need a pIan?

392
00:30:12,864 --> 00:30:16,265
I'm sure you've aIways had aII you
wanted, whether you knew it or not.

393
00:30:17,301 --> 00:30:19,769
You know, that 's true.

394
00:30:19,971 --> 00:30:24,499
The first time I reaIIy wanted
something and went for it...

395
00:30:24,709 --> 00:30:28,372
it was MichaeI.
And it turned out great!

396
00:30:32,116 --> 00:30:35,608
I just figured you being ajunior,
you'd have it aII figured out by now.

397
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:39,984
-That 's what you think, huh?
-No, but I'm dumb. Isn't that right?

398
00:30:40,258 --> 00:30:44,058
And uptight. And ugIy,
if I remember correctIy!

399
00:30:44,262 --> 00:30:48,096
No, I said aII of that
before I was on Prozac.

400
00:30:48,866 --> 00:30:52,632
-You're on Prozac?
-I wish.

401
00:30:53,638 --> 00:30:55,606
It 's ajoke.

402
00:30:57,441 --> 00:30:59,272
It 's okay.

403
00:31:04,115 --> 00:31:08,245
I shouId go. I stiII have some
more studying to do. FinaIs.

404
00:31:08,586 --> 00:31:11,987
Me too.
I'm gonnastay.

405
00:31:12,924 --> 00:31:14,858
AII right.

406
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:19,354
-So I'II see you around.
-Yeah.

407
00:31:23,634 --> 00:31:25,864
I'm sorry about Amy.

408
00:31:26,237 --> 00:31:28,137
It 's okay.

409
00:32:12,516 --> 00:32:16,714
-Did you get aII your cIasses?
-AII but one.

410
00:32:17,021 --> 00:32:19,854
-The eIusive one.
-Yes.

411
00:32:20,725 --> 00:32:24,058
-So did you have a good summer?
-Yeah.

412
00:32:24,261 --> 00:32:29,028
-I just went back to LA. You?
-Stayed here.

413
00:32:29,233 --> 00:32:32,964
Learned how to butter bageIs
for a Iiving. It 's surprisingIy easy.

414
00:32:33,170 --> 00:32:36,662
-You swipe it once back and forth.
-I take mine pIain.

415
00:32:36,874 --> 00:32:41,436
-Of course you do.
-No reguIations for the Internet!

416
00:32:44,148 --> 00:32:46,981
-So summer was good?
-Yeah.

417
00:32:47,385 --> 00:32:49,853
Everything's good.
It 's good.

418
00:32:53,524 --> 00:32:57,051
Jennifer, are you okay?

419
00:32:57,561 --> 00:33:01,691
I pushed him away. I IiteraIIy
did everything in my power...

420
00:33:01,899 --> 00:33:06,029
...to make sure that he dumped me!
-ObviousIy, you didn't Iike him.

421
00:33:06,237 --> 00:33:10,139
No, that 's the thing. I thought
it was just asummer fIing...

422
00:33:10,341 --> 00:33:13,310
but I actuaIIy started
to Iike him!

423
00:33:14,745 --> 00:33:17,236
Then why'd you push him away?

424
00:33:17,448 --> 00:33:20,747
I don't know. I just...

425
00:33:21,385 --> 00:33:27,324
-It 's just such a pain in the ass!
-Yes. Yes, it is.

426
00:33:29,627 --> 00:33:33,222
What about you?
Did you get any this summer?

427
00:33:34,231 --> 00:33:39,066
-WeII, I... no.
-You've got the right idea.

428
00:33:40,237 --> 00:33:43,570
You know, we shouId
do this again sometime.

429
00:33:43,774 --> 00:33:47,938
Not the whoIe crying thing,
but, you know... this.

430
00:33:49,346 --> 00:33:50,506
Sure.

431
00:33:52,616 --> 00:33:54,584
Good.

432
00:34:02,827 --> 00:34:05,455
Just another Iawsuit.

433
00:34:11,102 --> 00:34:14,196
-Hello. Wannago do something?
-No!

434
00:34:14,405 --> 00:34:19,001
-Youhaven't heardmyproposal.
-It 's the beauty of our friendship:

435
00:34:19,243 --> 00:34:22,144
I don't need to hear your proposaI
to know that my answer is ''no''.

436
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,580
I am the beauty in
our friendship.

437
00:34:25,116 --> 00:34:27,107
-I'm hanging up now.
-You can't.

438
00:34:27,318 --> 00:34:30,014
-Give me one goodreason!
-'Cause...

439
00:34:30,221 --> 00:34:33,952
I've rigged an expIosive device to
your phone, and your pIace wiII bIow.

440
00:34:34,358 --> 00:34:37,555
WeII, I've been
burned before, so...

441
00:34:37,762 --> 00:34:40,060
Come on.
lcan't studyanymore.

442
00:34:40,631 --> 00:34:43,293
I'm getting too smart.
PeopIe wiII start shunning me.

443
00:34:43,501 --> 00:34:46,026
-OnIy if you beg me.
-I just did.

444
00:34:46,837 --> 00:34:48,771
In Latin.

445
00:35:00,151 --> 00:35:01,675
Come on!

446
00:35:27,645 --> 00:35:29,306
-You weren't gonna go.
-I was too!

447
00:35:29,513 --> 00:35:33,210
-You weren't going!
-Ladies first.

448
00:35:35,419 --> 00:35:38,183
Okay. Fine.

449
00:35:38,956 --> 00:35:41,220
Why don't I count for you?

450
00:35:41,659 --> 00:35:44,093
-Okay.
-AII right.

451
00:35:44,328 --> 00:35:45,590
One.

452
00:35:45,796 --> 00:35:46,854
Two.

453
00:35:47,064 --> 00:35:49,430
-Three!
-Three. Here we go.

454
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:53,631
-You know, I can't heIp you.
-You can heIp me at the bottom.

455
00:36:01,779 --> 00:36:04,509
Do you think I'd Iook good
with a goatee?

456
00:36:05,683 --> 00:36:07,446
No.

457
00:36:22,066 --> 00:36:24,864
Wait! This is crazy!
I'm not a naturaI dancer.

458
00:36:25,069 --> 00:36:27,503
-No one in my famiIy is!
-Just move. Have fun!

459
00:36:27,805 --> 00:36:33,368
We're here to have fun. You, me
and that pubic hair on your chin.

460
00:36:35,145 --> 00:36:38,046
Just foIIow him and
do what he does!

461
00:37:35,306 --> 00:37:37,501
Where are you going?
It 's this way, man!

462
00:38:21,151 --> 00:38:24,018
-This isn't so bad.
-Good!

463
00:39:02,092 --> 00:39:04,083
Come here.

464
00:39:19,910 --> 00:39:22,902
You've never been
with awoman before?

465
00:39:23,147 --> 00:39:26,116
I've Iived with the monks my
whoIe Iife. UntiI yesterday.

466
00:39:26,383 --> 00:39:29,477
I waIked into the monsignor's office,
turned in my rosary beads and coIIar...

467
00:39:29,686 --> 00:39:32,814
got my deposit back,
and now here I am...

468
00:39:33,023 --> 00:39:36,550
pIaying this strange game
of sticks and baIIs.

469
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:40,287
-It 's caIIed pooI.
-PooI.

470
00:39:41,265 --> 00:39:44,098
-I have so much to Iearn.
-I'II teach you.

471
00:39:45,302 --> 00:39:48,328
Here. Okay.

472
00:39:48,906 --> 00:39:51,067
No, put your...

473
00:39:59,283 --> 00:40:02,309
-Don't hurt him! He's a priest!
-I'm a priest!

474
00:40:02,519 --> 00:40:05,955
How wouId you Iike to have a reIigious
experience with that cue stick?

475
00:40:11,395 --> 00:40:12,919
PIease.

476
00:40:17,234 --> 00:40:19,668
Run, father, run!

477
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:32,341
So, do you wanna
come up and dry off?

478
00:40:32,549 --> 00:40:35,541
-I don't know. Is Amy there?
-ProbabIy.

479
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:40,884
-No, I think I'm just gonna go home.
-Gottawrite in your diary?

480
00:40:41,091 --> 00:40:44,527
-Something Iike that.
-Okay.

481
00:40:47,998 --> 00:40:50,967
As much as I hate
to admit this...

482
00:40:51,168 --> 00:40:55,798
...I had fun tonight.
-Me too. It was good, cIean fun.

483
00:40:56,006 --> 00:40:58,634
Maybe we couId go there once
aweek and do our Iaundry.

484
00:40:58,842 --> 00:41:01,003
It 's cheaper than the pIace
I take mine to.

485
00:41:01,211 --> 00:41:03,406
More aIcohoI.

486
00:41:04,681 --> 00:41:05,978
What 's up?

487
00:41:06,183 --> 00:41:09,152
-Did you kids go swimming?
-Yeah.

488
00:41:09,353 --> 00:41:13,119
That 's great.
So what 's going on now?

489
00:41:13,323 --> 00:41:16,622
Because my pIans
kinda feII through.

490
00:41:16,827 --> 00:41:20,194
I invited Ryan up,
but he's going home to bed.

491
00:41:20,397 --> 00:41:21,830
ReaIIy?

492
00:41:22,032 --> 00:41:23,966
-I'm tired!
-He's tired.

493
00:41:24,535 --> 00:41:25,866
Yeah.

494
00:41:26,069 --> 00:41:29,402
I'm kinda... tired myseIf.

495
00:41:29,573 --> 00:41:32,736
ActuaIIy, we shouId
get outta here.

496
00:41:34,745 --> 00:41:36,713
Good night.

497
00:41:37,714 --> 00:41:39,875
You coming?

498
00:41:43,187 --> 00:41:45,951
I gotta hand it to you, man.
Very cooI back there.

499
00:41:46,156 --> 00:41:47,987
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

500
00:41:48,192 --> 00:41:51,218
She begs you to come up, and you
hoId back. She's going nuts right now.

501
00:41:51,428 --> 00:41:53,862
-I don't think so.
-Did you hear how she said ''bed''?

502
00:41:54,064 --> 00:41:56,624
-You can aImost smeII the Iinens!
-You're way off on this one.

503
00:41:56,833 --> 00:41:59,324
-No, I don't think so.
-Are you in a hurry?

504
00:41:59,536 --> 00:42:03,302
-No. Why do you ask?
-That 's him! Get him!

505
00:42:03,507 --> 00:42:06,067
Come on!

506
00:42:06,743 --> 00:42:10,577
-Let 's go!
-Better start praying, father!

507
00:42:14,985 --> 00:42:18,148
-Who the heII was that?
-I have no idea.

508
00:42:18,355 --> 00:42:23,725
Listen, best thing for you to do
is just forget it ever happened.

509
00:42:25,362 --> 00:42:27,557
-Forgotten yet?
-No!

510
00:42:28,098 --> 00:42:30,589
-How about now?
-Man, no.

511
00:42:30,801 --> 00:42:33,201
Jeez, you're Iike an eIephant.

512
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:40,037
Great. You're just
in time for cookies!

513
00:42:42,045 --> 00:42:46,243
-They Iook good.
-No. Not those.

514
00:42:46,717 --> 00:42:49,277
I thought it 'd be nice to have
asnack when you got home...

515
00:42:49,486 --> 00:42:52,683
but I didn't know when that 'd be, so I
guessed and made a batch around 9...

516
00:42:52,889 --> 00:42:58,225
but they burnt. So I did another one
around 9:3O, and then they burnt.

517
00:42:58,428 --> 00:43:01,659
So I waited a IittIe Ionger before
the third batch, and now you're home.

518
00:43:02,065 --> 00:43:04,829
It 's perfect. They'II be ready
in about two minutes.

519
00:43:06,069 --> 00:43:10,267
-Why are you wet?
-Ryan and I went dancing.

520
00:43:11,808 --> 00:43:14,800
-Are you in Iove with him?
-What?

521
00:43:15,979 --> 00:43:18,470
-Are you?
-No.

522
00:43:19,516 --> 00:43:22,815
-I don't beIieve you.
-What? We're just friends.

523
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:26,954
-Yeah, but he's in Iove with you.
-ActuaIIy, no. I don't think so.

524
00:43:27,257 --> 00:43:29,521
Then what do you do aII the time
that you're together?

525
00:43:29,726 --> 00:43:33,685
I don't know. We do stuff.
We taIk about stuff.

526
00:43:34,731 --> 00:43:39,862
-Why? You have me for that.
-It 's nice to have a guy's opinion.

527
00:43:40,470 --> 00:43:43,462
About who has the best pizza
and who has the best tits?

528
00:43:43,674 --> 00:43:46,700
Gino's Pizzeria, Susan Sarandon.
Why are you acting so weird?

529
00:43:47,077 --> 00:43:49,807
You're the one who's acting weird.
You're the one spending...

530
00:43:50,013 --> 00:43:52,846
aII your time with a guy that
you're not even interested in.

531
00:43:53,050 --> 00:43:55,746
My therapist thinks that
you may have some issues.

532
00:43:55,952 --> 00:44:01,185
-You're taIking to her about me?
-Of course I am. I worry about you.

533
00:44:01,725 --> 00:44:05,661
Listen, if you ever
need to taIk, I'm here.

534
00:44:11,601 --> 00:44:14,468
-I Ieft her number on your piIIow.
-Whose?

535
00:44:14,971 --> 00:44:17,804
My therapist 's.
Good night.

536
00:44:23,613 --> 00:44:27,777
See that guy there? He's the kind
of guy who waIks with his feet...

537
00:44:27,984 --> 00:44:30,544
if you know what I'm saying.

538
00:44:31,188 --> 00:44:33,247
-Come on, you do it.
-Okay.

539
00:44:34,391 --> 00:44:37,758
-She Iikes crackers in her soup.
-No.

540
00:44:37,961 --> 00:44:39,451
-What do you mean, no?
-That 's wrong.

541
00:44:39,663 --> 00:44:40,925
-No, it 's not!
-Yes, it is.

542
00:44:41,131 --> 00:44:42,359
-Why?
-It 's ajudgement.

543
00:44:42,566 --> 00:44:46,024
-Some peopIe don't eat crackers.
-ExactIy.

544
00:44:46,236 --> 00:44:50,673
No, the point is to judge where
there's no judgement to be made.

545
00:44:50,874 --> 00:44:54,401
-It 's a non-judgmentaI judgement.
-No, no. That 's stupid.

546
00:44:54,611 --> 00:44:57,205
No, it 's not. It 's funny.
I'm Iaughing.

547
00:44:57,514 --> 00:44:59,482
Yeah, 'cause it 's stupid!

548
00:45:00,484 --> 00:45:04,784
Wanna hear something even more
stupid? I'm going on a date tonight.

549
00:45:05,756 --> 00:45:08,156
-ReaIIy?
-Do you think I'm nuts?

550
00:45:08,358 --> 00:45:10,690
-No, I think it 's great.
-ReaIIy?

551
00:45:10,894 --> 00:45:13,328
-Yeah.
-You shouId bet back in the saddIe.

552
00:45:13,964 --> 00:45:16,933
No, I'm the kinda cowboy
that doesn't Iike to ride.

553
00:45:17,401 --> 00:45:21,030
-See? That one's not funny.
-Yeah, I know.

554
00:45:30,113 --> 00:45:32,513
Ladies.
How are we doing?

555
00:45:36,486 --> 00:45:39,216
Hey, it 's beautifuI out, huh?

556
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:55,797
No, I'm not good at that kinda thing.
You shouId caII Hunter.

557
00:46:01,611 --> 00:46:05,411
After investment banking, I decided
to do something for myseIf.

558
00:46:05,615 --> 00:46:09,278
I seII for ten years. I reached
a point in my Iife, I said...

559
00:46:09,486 --> 00:46:12,717
''I don't wanna do
aII the work''.

560
00:46:12,923 --> 00:46:15,619
Jen! Thank God
you're here, sis!

561
00:46:15,826 --> 00:46:20,456
BiIIy, what 's wrong?
Kurt, this is BiIIy, my brother.

562
00:46:20,664 --> 00:46:24,065
-BiIIy, this is Kurt.
-Nice to meet you, BiIIy.

563
00:46:24,267 --> 00:46:27,327
-I was teIIing her about my boat.
-There's no time for boats!

564
00:46:27,537 --> 00:46:30,438
-Why? What happened?
-It 's mother. She's sick!

565
00:46:30,874 --> 00:46:33,468
My God.
What happened?

566
00:46:33,977 --> 00:46:37,413
-I just toId you. She's sick!
-Sick how?

567
00:46:39,015 --> 00:46:41,142
Yeah.
Sick how?

568
00:46:41,351 --> 00:46:43,751
You know!
Sick Iike the Iast time!

569
00:46:43,987 --> 00:46:46,751
No, I wasn't there Iast time.
ExpIain it to me.

570
00:46:46,957 --> 00:46:51,394
There's no time for questions!
Mother is sick. We have to go!

571
00:46:52,195 --> 00:46:54,163
Sorry.

572
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:00,563
-Are you insane?
-You were great!

573
00:47:00,770 --> 00:47:03,102
''Sick how?''
I feIt Iike such an idiot!

574
00:47:03,306 --> 00:47:06,867
Ryan, you were great
in there. ReaIIy!

575
00:47:08,745 --> 00:47:10,303
Thanks.

576
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:13,080
Thank you.

577
00:47:14,417 --> 00:47:16,112
Man!

578
00:47:17,287 --> 00:47:21,121
You know, next time I was thinking
about trying it with a Iimp.

579
00:47:21,324 --> 00:47:24,191
Baby steps, Ryan.
Baby steps.

580
00:47:25,962 --> 00:47:29,193
-Tonight? No, it 's tomorrow night.
-No, they changed it.

581
00:47:29,399 --> 00:47:31,526
-Who did? Ryan?
-No.

582
00:47:31,735 --> 00:47:35,000
-WeII, I can't go.
-Why not? What are you doing?

583
00:47:35,205 --> 00:47:37,833
Staying in!
I was pIanning on staying in.

584
00:47:38,041 --> 00:47:42,774
I was gonna give myseIf a manicure,
a pedicure and do a conditioning.

585
00:47:42,979 --> 00:47:46,972
-Can't you do aII that this afternoon?
-No, because I have cIass.

586
00:47:47,183 --> 00:47:51,984
I have to taIk to my professor
about my paper due on Monday...

587
00:47:52,188 --> 00:47:56,181
that I was gonna finish whiIe my
naiIs were drying and proof Iater!

588
00:47:56,393 --> 00:47:59,226
So that everything wouId
be done before the party.

589
00:47:59,429 --> 00:48:01,829
-Can't you do aII that tomorrow?
-No.

590
00:48:02,032 --> 00:48:08,164
Tomorrow I'II be rushed and tired,
and I have to get everything done!

591
00:48:08,371 --> 00:48:12,034
-I can't beIieve they changed it!
-It 's Friday. You got aII weekend.

592
00:48:13,376 --> 00:48:14,900
What 's that supposed to mean?

593
00:48:15,111 --> 00:48:18,877
That 's Iike on Monday
saying you've got aII week.

594
00:48:48,211 --> 00:48:49,974
Yummy.

595
00:49:12,535 --> 00:49:14,628
-What do they want?
-Who?

596
00:49:14,838 --> 00:49:16,738
They. The chiquitas.

597
00:49:16,973 --> 00:49:20,101
I'm busting my ass trying
to fit into their moId...

598
00:49:20,310 --> 00:49:24,110
of what makes an interesting guy.
I cannot figure out what they want.

599
00:49:24,781 --> 00:49:26,840
What do you want?

600
00:49:27,050 --> 00:49:33,387
I don't know. Get Iaid. Have fun.
Have someone Iove me for who I am.

601
00:49:34,090 --> 00:49:36,923
And who is that exactIy?

602
00:49:37,127 --> 00:49:42,155
You're absoIuteIy right. What 's
wrong with being from the country?

603
00:49:42,365 --> 00:49:45,095
A simpIe kid raised on fresh eggs and
good vaIues who had to get up...

604
00:49:45,301 --> 00:49:48,236
at the crack of dawn every morning
with a dog named Lucky by his side...

605
00:49:48,438 --> 00:49:50,963
...to heIp his pawith the cattIe.
-Hunter...

606
00:49:51,174 --> 00:49:53,665
you're not from the country.

607
00:49:53,877 --> 00:49:56,846
Jeez, Ryan, what do
you want me to say?

608
00:49:57,047 --> 00:50:00,448
''Hi, my name's Steve. I grew up in the
suburbs with two working parents...

609
00:50:00,650 --> 00:50:03,744
two sisters and a two-car garage.
I have no reaI identity...

610
00:50:03,953 --> 00:50:07,150
nor do I have a cIue what I'm doing
or what I wanna be. Wanna go out?''

611
00:50:10,060 --> 00:50:12,893
-Your name is Steve?
-The whoIe point of coIIege...

612
00:50:13,129 --> 00:50:16,997
...it 's where you reinvent yourseIf.
-It 's where you define yourseIf.

613
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:19,828
-Your name is Steve?!
-Yes.

614
00:50:20,036 --> 00:50:23,528
And I'm not so crazy about Steve.
Why wouId anyone eIse be?

615
00:50:23,740 --> 00:50:27,836
-That 's who you are!
-ReaIIy? It 's just that easy?

616
00:50:28,044 --> 00:50:31,639
Then drop the cooI guy act and go teII
Jennifer how you reaIIy feeI about her.

617
00:50:31,848 --> 00:50:33,076
What?

618
00:50:33,283 --> 00:50:36,275
But you'd better do it quick,
before she Ieaves with that guy.

619
00:50:37,220 --> 00:50:39,484
I don't feeI that way
about her.

620
00:50:39,989 --> 00:50:42,822
Seeing her with that guy
right now doesn't bother you?

621
00:50:43,026 --> 00:50:46,393
No. She goes on dates aII the time.
We taIk about her dates.

622
00:50:46,596 --> 00:50:47,824
-And you're fine with that?
-Yes!

623
00:50:48,031 --> 00:50:49,225
-HonestIy.
-Yes.

624
00:50:49,432 --> 00:50:52,595
Okay, then how come you're
here aII by your Ionesome, huh?

625
00:50:52,802 --> 00:50:56,795
If you're waiting for a girI to do
aII the work, you are mistaken.

626
00:50:57,006 --> 00:51:01,602
-They don't do things that way.
-Excuse me. Is your name Ryan?

627
00:51:01,811 --> 00:51:04,780
-Yeah.
-You're in my Statistics cIass.

628
00:51:04,981 --> 00:51:06,812
Nice.

629
00:51:07,016 --> 00:51:09,211
What are the odds?

630
00:51:10,453 --> 00:51:14,082
You're Engineering, right?
I'm EIectricaI.

631
00:51:14,524 --> 00:51:16,651
Not me. My major.

632
00:51:17,527 --> 00:51:20,826
Can you beIieve how much work
they give us? But I Iike it...

633
00:51:21,030 --> 00:51:26,832
because many peopIe fIoat Iike
negative ions with no pIace to go.

634
00:51:27,036 --> 00:51:30,472
I'm a Iaser. I know what I
want and I go straight for it.

635
00:51:34,410 --> 00:51:37,402
I feeI Iike there's an armature
spinning in my head.

636
00:51:37,614 --> 00:51:41,448
-You wannasit down?
-Sure.

637
00:51:41,651 --> 00:51:44,552
ActuaIIy, I was just Ieaving.

638
00:51:45,588 --> 00:51:49,046
-It 's because I'm too forward?
-No. Not at aII.

639
00:51:49,259 --> 00:51:52,524
There's just these two assignments
that I've been putting off.

640
00:51:52,729 --> 00:51:58,395
I toId my girIfriend that I wouId
meet her twenty minutes ago.

641
00:51:58,902 --> 00:52:02,133
-You have a girIfriend?
-Yes, I do.

642
00:52:02,872 --> 00:52:08,367
-Now I feeI reaIIy so stupid.
-You're not. I reaIIy have to go.

643
00:52:18,855 --> 00:52:20,482
Hey, sis!

644
00:52:21,057 --> 00:52:25,016
-You okay?
-Yeah, I'm great. Thanks, BiIIy.

645
00:52:28,832 --> 00:52:30,823
So I'm gonna take off, then.

646
00:52:31,067 --> 00:52:34,093
-Okay.
-See you, bro.

647
00:52:49,285 --> 00:52:53,415
-So, how did you get rid of him?
-We fooIed around for awhiIe.

648
00:52:53,623 --> 00:52:58,026
-Then I said I had an earIy cIass.
-Wait. You fooIed around?

649
00:52:58,528 --> 00:53:02,362
HoId on. When we're taIking
about fooIing around...

650
00:53:02,565 --> 00:53:06,023
are we taIking about
fooIing around or...?

651
00:53:06,436 --> 00:53:09,894
We're taIking about...
fooIing around.

652
00:53:13,042 --> 00:53:15,567
-It 's not Iike we had sex.
-I didn't say that.

653
00:53:15,778 --> 00:53:18,906
-CouIdn't find a condom.
-You wouId have?!

654
00:53:19,115 --> 00:53:21,049
Yeah. ProbabIy.

655
00:53:21,251 --> 00:53:24,414
I have midterms coming up.
I gotta reIieve the stress somehow.

656
00:53:26,122 --> 00:53:28,613
-That 's amazing!
-What?

657
00:53:28,825 --> 00:53:33,421
That on any given date the possibiIity
exists that you'II have sex with a guy.

658
00:53:33,630 --> 00:53:36,360
Isn't that the point of dating?
PossibiIities?

659
00:53:36,566 --> 00:53:39,330
It 's not Iike I know what 's gonna
happen in advance. I don't.

660
00:53:39,535 --> 00:53:42,629
Sometimes it 'd be awhoIe Iot easier
to have sex than have to sit there...

661
00:53:42,839 --> 00:53:45,603
...and think of something cIever to say.
-Okay, granted.

662
00:53:45,808 --> 00:53:48,504
I haven't been in that situation
in a Iong time...

663
00:53:48,711 --> 00:53:51,578
but I just can't sIeep with
somebody unIess I Iike them.

664
00:53:51,781 --> 00:53:55,239
-So you think I'm asIut?
-I didn't say that!

665
00:53:55,451 --> 00:53:58,420
-We're just different.
-Yeah, you sIeep with no one.

666
00:53:58,621 --> 00:54:00,680
-So?
-''So''?

667
00:54:00,924 --> 00:54:03,620
Do you know any other singIe
2O-year-oId coIIege guys...

668
00:54:03,826 --> 00:54:06,317
who never sIeep with anyone?
Who don't even try?

669
00:54:06,529 --> 00:54:09,464
-Maybe you're trying too hard.
-Ryan, you don't try at aII.

670
00:54:10,533 --> 00:54:13,696
I just think that it might be
making things weird between us.

671
00:54:13,903 --> 00:54:15,962
What are you taIking about?

672
00:54:16,172 --> 00:54:20,666
Are we friends?
I mean, am I your friend...

673
00:54:20,877 --> 00:54:24,210
or have I just become
your girIfriend substitute?

674
00:54:24,414 --> 00:54:26,814
-Are you serious?
-Yeah.

675
00:54:27,016 --> 00:54:29,951
It 's Iike, with me in your Iife,
you never have to try.

676
00:54:30,153 --> 00:54:33,281
It 's the beauty of our reIationship.
You'II just never get hurt again...

677
00:54:33,489 --> 00:54:36,720
as Iong as you pretend
I'm your girIfriend.

678
00:54:39,495 --> 00:54:40,985
Yeah.

679
00:54:41,764 --> 00:54:45,222
Maybe we shouIdn't
hang out anymore.

680
00:54:49,772 --> 00:54:51,501
Ryan!

681
00:54:52,375 --> 00:54:56,141
I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean that.

682
00:54:56,346 --> 00:54:58,371
-Yeah, you did.
-No!

683
00:54:58,581 --> 00:55:03,518
I Iove hanging out with you. You're
my favorite person in the worId.

684
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:07,281
-I don't wanna change anything.
-Maybe you're right.

685
00:55:07,490 --> 00:55:11,551
No, I'm wrong! You're just waiting
for the right girI to come aIong...

686
00:55:11,761 --> 00:55:15,891
and you don't take sex IightIy.
I think that that 's a great quaIity.

687
00:55:16,766 --> 00:55:21,897
No, I think I am hiding
behind you or us.

688
00:55:23,606 --> 00:55:28,407
-There was this girI at the party...
-A girI girI? You didn't teII me.

689
00:55:28,611 --> 00:55:31,774
-I just bIew her off!
-Why?

690
00:55:33,149 --> 00:55:35,208
I don't know.

691
00:55:37,487 --> 00:55:42,618
-I shouId have given her a chance.
-Yeah. You shouId have.

692
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:47,853
WeII, you stiII can.
And why not, right?

693
00:55:49,499 --> 00:55:51,763
Yeah. Why not?

694
00:55:58,007 --> 00:56:01,738
-So, is she cute?
-Yeah, I guess.

695
00:56:02,678 --> 00:56:06,079
-Is she cuter than me?
-No!

696
00:56:06,282 --> 00:56:08,580
She's thinner.

697
00:56:11,654 --> 00:56:15,590
Let me get thisstraight.
You thinkthat's totallynormal?

698
00:56:15,792 --> 00:56:17,589
Yes!

699
00:56:17,794 --> 00:56:21,252
I have the exact same top.
How come it Iooks better on her?

700
00:56:21,464 --> 00:56:25,457
Because she's anorexic, has fake
boobs and a personaI trainer.

701
00:56:25,668 --> 00:56:28,136
Are you saying I shouId
get my boobs done?

702
00:56:28,337 --> 00:56:32,398
-Yeah, totaIIy.
-Okay. Come on!

703
00:56:32,608 --> 00:56:35,975
-You can't say this ain't fun!
-No, can't I?

704
00:56:36,179 --> 00:56:40,639
When's the Iast time we did this?
Just you and me. It 's nice.

705
00:56:40,850 --> 00:56:44,479
-Amy, of course it 's nice.
-I have an idea.

706
00:56:44,687 --> 00:56:48,521
What if you had to, you know, faiI
a coupIe of cIasses and move back?

707
00:56:48,724 --> 00:56:50,715
WouId that be so bad?

708
00:56:50,927 --> 00:56:54,363
I mean, it 's just that ItaIy's
so incredibIy far away!

709
00:56:54,564 --> 00:56:57,226
Yeah, that 's the beauty of it.

710
00:56:57,433 --> 00:57:00,300
What about me? What am I
supposed to do next year?

711
00:57:00,503 --> 00:57:03,165
Nothing.
Just Iike you did this year.

712
00:57:03,372 --> 00:57:08,469
Maybe with me gone, you'II get off
your fat ass and have some fun.

713
00:57:08,678 --> 00:57:12,774
I don't wanna do nothing without
you. And I don't wanna have fun.

714
00:57:12,982 --> 00:57:18,477
-And I have a great ass.
-You do. No, you have a great ass.

715
00:57:27,430 --> 00:57:30,524
-What are you doing?
-I'm kissing you.

716
00:57:34,203 --> 00:57:37,604
God. I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry.

717
00:57:37,807 --> 00:57:41,743
I don't know why I did that.
I just reaIIy wanted to kiss you.

718
00:57:41,944 --> 00:57:45,778
-My God! I'm such an idiot!
-Amy? Amy, it 's...

719
00:57:49,152 --> 00:57:51,814
Hey, buddy, watch this.

720
00:57:54,223 --> 00:57:56,350
It 's Iike a bridge.

721
00:57:57,026 --> 00:57:59,153
It is a bridge.

722
00:58:01,497 --> 00:58:03,761
Yeah, you're absoIuteIy right.

723
00:58:08,738 --> 00:58:11,605
-Is Katie coming?
-She's gonna meet us at the bar.

724
00:58:11,841 --> 00:58:15,538
ReaIIy? This is great.
This is great!

725
00:58:15,745 --> 00:58:19,374
-She'II experience the new me.
-This ought to be good.

726
00:58:19,582 --> 00:58:22,517
No, I'm serious. No more Iies.
It 's Iike you said, buddy.

727
00:58:22,718 --> 00:58:25,687
I don't need to pretend
for someone eIse to Iike me.

728
00:58:26,122 --> 00:58:30,286
-That 's good!
-What you see is what you get.

729
00:58:30,526 --> 00:58:32,551
Hunter unpIugged.

730
00:58:33,095 --> 00:58:35,723
Don't you mean
Steve unpIugged?

731
00:58:43,406 --> 00:58:46,466
-So Megan seems nice?
-Yeah, she is.

732
00:58:47,944 --> 00:58:50,970
That PauI guy... didn't you go out
with him a coupIe times before?

733
00:58:51,180 --> 00:58:54,411
-Yeah. It 's working out.
-Good for you.

734
00:58:54,617 --> 00:58:58,314
Jen, Megan here has never been
to the automotive museum.

735
00:58:58,521 --> 00:59:00,421
Imagine that.

736
00:59:04,393 --> 00:59:07,760
Did you read how the zoo animaIs
tried to reorganize their cages...

737
00:59:07,964 --> 00:59:11,024
in aIphabeticaI order? ApparentIy
the aardvarks started it.

738
00:59:11,234 --> 00:59:14,203
That 's right.
But the zebras vetoed it.

739
00:59:15,037 --> 00:59:18,666
-Yeah. How did you know?
-I don't know.

740
00:59:18,874 --> 00:59:22,173
-I don't get it.
-Me neither.

741
00:59:25,548 --> 00:59:28,449
So, Katie, how are
you Iiking BerkeIey?

742
00:59:28,651 --> 00:59:32,951
-It 's a bit overwheIming, you know?
-Katie's a doubIe major here.

743
00:59:33,155 --> 00:59:35,817
-I don't know how she does it.
-How do you do it?

744
00:59:36,025 --> 00:59:39,017
I can bareIy juggIe
napping and sIeeping.

745
00:59:39,228 --> 00:59:42,925
This may sound weird, but I spend
a Iot of time with the eIderIy.

746
00:59:43,132 --> 00:59:46,761
-That doesn't sound weird.
-It sounds a IittIe weird.

747
00:59:46,969 --> 00:59:50,769
When you're sitting with someone
who's been through two wars...

748
00:59:50,973 --> 00:59:55,569
marriages, kids, grandkids,
money probIems and disease...

749
00:59:55,778 --> 01:00:00,044
getting a B on a BioIogy exam
just doesn't seem Iike a big deaI.

750
01:00:00,249 --> 01:00:02,649
I think we shouId do
what the Eskimos do:

751
01:00:02,852 --> 01:00:06,549
kick the oId peopIe out of the igIoos,
Ieave them for poIar bears and storms.

752
01:00:07,156 --> 01:00:10,683
The minute they can't go on the
big hunt, you gotta get rid of them.

753
01:00:10,893 --> 01:00:15,227
I mean, otherwise they'II
just suck us dry. Bastards.

754
01:00:17,633 --> 01:00:20,568
-You're kidding, right?
-No, not at aII.

755
01:00:20,770 --> 01:00:23,933
And take away their driver's
Iicense too whiIe you're at it.

756
01:00:29,712 --> 01:00:31,373
What?

757
01:00:31,580 --> 01:00:35,038
So you're not aIIowed to have an
opinion anymore? I did what you said!

758
01:00:35,251 --> 01:00:38,118
I wasn't just agreeing for
the sake of it, I wasn't just...

759
01:00:38,321 --> 01:00:40,915
making things up so it wouId Iook
Iike we had something in common.

760
01:00:41,123 --> 01:00:43,819
I did what you said.
I was being honest.

761
01:00:44,026 --> 01:00:48,486
Yeah, but you don't have to say
everything that comes in your head!

762
01:00:48,698 --> 01:00:52,930
So now I'm being too honest?
I don't know what you want from me.

763
01:00:53,135 --> 01:00:56,002
I don't know what
anyone wants from me.

764
01:01:02,411 --> 01:01:04,538
So, what happened?

765
01:01:04,747 --> 01:01:08,376
The whoIe beauty of PauI is that
he was never going to settIe down.

766
01:01:08,584 --> 01:01:13,681
Then he feII in Iove with me. Nothing
worse than a bad boy gone soft.

767
01:01:13,889 --> 01:01:17,416
-Don't I know it?
-He stopped drinking, taking drugs.

768
01:01:17,626 --> 01:01:21,289
-He even stopped cheating on me.
-No wonder you dumped him.

769
01:01:22,365 --> 01:01:24,959
It just wasn't working out,
you know?

770
01:01:27,136 --> 01:01:31,766
-What 's up with what 's her name?
-Megan.

771
01:01:31,974 --> 01:01:34,306
-Whatever.
-It 's okay.

772
01:01:34,510 --> 01:01:37,343
-That 's it?
-What am I supposed to say?

773
01:01:37,546 --> 01:01:41,346
WeII, do you Iike her?
Is she the one?

774
01:01:41,550 --> 01:01:45,714
I don't know.
I'm working on it.

775
01:01:49,558 --> 01:01:53,392
-You're the one who wanted to go.
-I thought I wouId feeI better.

776
01:01:53,729 --> 01:01:56,459
-And?
-I don't know.

777
01:01:57,099 --> 01:01:59,761
-It 's such a Iot of buIIshit!
-BuIIshit?

778
01:01:59,969 --> 01:02:03,461
Show me a movie that takes pIace
6 months after they get together...

779
01:02:03,672 --> 01:02:06,368
...when everything faIIs apart.
-Jennifer...

780
01:02:06,575 --> 01:02:10,341
It 's just that I don't think that
any of us know who we reaIIy are.

781
01:02:10,546 --> 01:02:14,004
So how are we supposed
to know who Mr. Right is?

782
01:02:17,953 --> 01:02:22,253
How do you know he's Mr. Right?
Is it because you wear bIack...

783
01:02:22,458 --> 01:02:25,518
drink cappuccino,
you both have tattoos?

784
01:02:27,596 --> 01:02:30,827
Who here has ever
been dumped?

785
01:02:33,269 --> 01:02:37,399
And who here has
dumped someone?

786
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:42,004
We've aII been in Iove. But we
never know that it 's not true Iove...

787
01:02:42,211 --> 01:02:46,204
untiI it 's over.
What if there's no ''one''?

788
01:02:46,415 --> 01:02:49,282
Or ''two'', or ''three'',
or ''four'' or ''five''?

789
01:02:49,485 --> 01:02:52,921
What if there's no such thing
as true Iove...

790
01:02:53,355 --> 01:02:57,985
but we're too afraid to admit it,
so we keep on dressing up?

791
01:02:58,194 --> 01:03:01,220
We keep on pretending to be
something that we are not?

792
01:03:01,430 --> 01:03:05,526
We keep turning our Iives
upside down, Iosing ourseIves...

793
01:03:05,734 --> 01:03:10,467
in something that we hope is better
than what we think that we are?

794
01:03:10,906 --> 01:03:14,501
What if that something
that we're Iooking for...

795
01:03:16,345 --> 01:03:18,870
just doesn't exist?

796
01:03:45,241 --> 01:03:48,972
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, fine.

797
01:03:49,178 --> 01:03:52,409
I was just working on
my fear of pubIic speaking.

798
01:03:54,083 --> 01:03:57,382
Why does everything
just have to be so...

799
01:03:58,120 --> 01:04:01,453
...just so?
-I don't know.

800
01:04:09,131 --> 01:04:13,431
-You're shaking.
-You Iet me drink aII that caffeine.

801
01:04:16,305 --> 01:04:21,265
-I don't know what 's wrong with me.
-Maybe you're getting your period.

802
01:04:22,444 --> 01:04:24,912
Yeah, maybe.

803
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:53,008
Wait a second...

804
01:04:53,208 --> 01:04:54,937
No.

805
01:07:13,582 --> 01:07:16,551
-Where are you going?
-CIass.

806
01:07:16,752 --> 01:07:21,689
No, you're staying right here.
Where I can see you.

807
01:07:21,890 --> 01:07:25,883
-I reaIIy have to go.
-You never go to cIass.

808
01:07:26,028 --> 01:07:30,692
-I know. That 's why I have to go.
-Wait. I'II make us breakfast.

809
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:34,533
It 's okay. I'm Iate.

810
01:07:39,908 --> 01:07:42,399
I'II see you Iater.

811
01:07:43,412 --> 01:07:46,142
Is this about Megan?

812
01:07:47,349 --> 01:07:49,249
No.

813
01:07:49,451 --> 01:07:51,476
I'm gonna teII her.

814
01:07:52,888 --> 01:07:55,118
Maybe you shouIdn't.

815
01:08:00,729 --> 01:08:03,493
We'II taIk about
this Iater. Okay?

816
01:08:05,300 --> 01:08:07,131
Yeah, okay.

817
01:08:07,736 --> 01:08:13,231
Stay as Iong as you Iike, and
you know where everything is.

818
01:08:21,917 --> 01:08:23,782
Jen!

819
01:08:24,720 --> 01:08:26,381
Jen!

820
01:08:28,023 --> 01:08:31,117
-I have to taIk about what happened.
-Amy, it 's okay.

821
01:08:31,326 --> 01:08:35,057
No, it 's not okay. But it is okay,
because I've been thinking about it...

822
01:08:35,264 --> 01:08:37,664
and I think what happened is that
you're my best friend and I Iove you...

823
01:08:37,866 --> 01:08:40,630
and I got jeaIous when you were
spending so much time with Ryan...

824
01:08:40,836 --> 01:08:43,464
and then with you graduating.
And then I think in aweird way...

825
01:08:43,672 --> 01:08:46,470
I was trying to keep things the way
they were, and I did that...

826
01:08:46,675 --> 01:08:49,803
because I was afraid of Iosing you.
Isn't that amazing?

827
01:08:50,646 --> 01:08:53,877
Yeah, without therapy!
I came up with it on my on.

828
01:08:54,349 --> 01:08:58,547
I was thinking about aII the time
we spent together, then it hit me:

829
01:08:58,754 --> 01:09:01,655
by kissing you, I was trying
to prevent change.

830
01:09:01,857 --> 01:09:04,291
But maybe change isn't
aIways catastrophic.

831
01:09:04,493 --> 01:09:06,859
Before we met, I didn't
know you at aII, right?

832
01:09:07,062 --> 01:09:09,587
-Right.
-That was a change.

833
01:09:09,798 --> 01:09:12,596
That was a great change!
I Ioved that change!

834
01:09:12,801 --> 01:09:16,532
Who knows? Maybe I'II kiII
myseIf by midterms next year...

835
01:09:16,738 --> 01:09:21,038
but, then again, maybe I won't.
Maybe it 'II be okay.

836
01:09:21,243 --> 01:09:24,007
That 's the beauty of change. You
never know how it wiII work out.

837
01:09:24,913 --> 01:09:28,508
-So everything's okay?
-Yeah, never been better.

838
01:09:32,955 --> 01:09:36,652
-You know Ryan's in your bed?
-Yeah.

839
01:09:37,326 --> 01:09:41,228
-You know he's naked, right?
-Yeah.

840
01:09:41,697 --> 01:09:45,224
-You know I'm curious, right?
-Yeah.

841
01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:47,866
So? What happened?

842
01:09:48,604 --> 01:09:52,199
I think I was afraid
of Iosing him.

843
01:10:00,616 --> 01:10:02,413
Megan!

844
01:10:07,022 --> 01:10:10,822
I'm the one who toId him to
start dating, and then he did.

845
01:10:11,026 --> 01:10:13,927
I didn't get to see him much, then
the thing with PauI happened...

846
01:10:14,129 --> 01:10:16,029
...and seeing him with Mary...
-Megan.

847
01:10:16,231 --> 01:10:18,791
Whatever.
I just wanted to be with him.

848
01:10:19,001 --> 01:10:22,869
It was a huge mistake.
Huge, big, fat mistake.

849
01:10:23,071 --> 01:10:26,336
We're friends.
We're great as friends.

850
01:10:26,541 --> 01:10:30,272
-What are you gonna do about it?
-I have no idea!

851
01:10:30,479 --> 01:10:35,041
He takes this so seriousIy, and the
Iast thing I wanna do is hurt him.

852
01:10:36,051 --> 01:10:39,282
Go to heII, Ryan!
Go to heII!

853
01:10:41,323 --> 01:10:43,188
What if I'm in Iove with her?

854
01:10:43,392 --> 01:10:47,226
-Are you?
-I don't know. Maybe.

855
01:10:47,429 --> 01:10:50,364
-What does that mean?
-I don't know. I just...

856
01:10:50,565 --> 01:10:53,398
don't want things to be
weird with us.

857
01:10:53,602 --> 01:10:57,470
Buddy, if you're Iooking to me
for answers, I'm fIattered...

858
01:10:57,673 --> 01:11:00,267
but you've come
to the wrong pIace.

859
01:11:00,475 --> 01:11:03,638
If I just pretend nothing happened,
I'II be Iying to myseIf...

860
01:11:03,845 --> 01:11:06,336
about feeIings
I might be feeIing.

861
01:11:06,548 --> 01:11:10,314
But if I teII her how I am feeIing,
she'II run. That 's what she does.

862
01:11:10,519 --> 01:11:15,582
I know that better than anyone.
That 's the Iast thing I want.

863
01:11:15,791 --> 01:11:20,785
Being yourseIf, not being yourseIf.
WeIcome to my worId.

864
01:11:41,383 --> 01:11:44,978
-Does this feeI weird to you?
-Yes!

865
01:11:45,187 --> 01:11:48,054
-Maybe we shouId taIk about this.
-I think that wouId be good.

866
01:11:48,256 --> 01:11:53,694
Things might get strange between us
because of what happened Iast night...

867
01:11:53,895 --> 01:11:56,261
...and I don't want that to happen.
-Me neither.

868
01:11:56,465 --> 01:11:59,866
`Cause we're too good together
to Iet that come between us.

869
01:12:01,069 --> 01:12:04,766
-It was a mistake.
-You think so?

870
01:12:04,973 --> 01:12:08,431
-Yes.
-I think you're right.

871
01:12:08,643 --> 01:12:13,546
I think that we just got carried
away in the moment and...

872
01:12:13,749 --> 01:12:16,980
...you know.
-Yes.

873
01:12:19,554 --> 01:12:25,550
Last night was reaIIy speciaI to me,
because you're reaIIy speciaI to me.

874
01:12:25,761 --> 01:12:29,527
But that 's aII it was.
It was an incredibIy speciaI night.

875
01:12:30,732 --> 01:12:35,226
I got worried that maybe we'd give
it more importance than we shouId.

876
01:12:37,506 --> 01:12:40,566
No. I'm totaIIy with you.

877
01:12:42,277 --> 01:12:44,211
Great.

878
01:12:45,881 --> 01:12:50,545
-You didn't teII Megan, did you?
-No, no.

879
01:12:50,752 --> 01:12:53,550
-It 's probabIy better not to.
-Yeah.

880
01:12:54,256 --> 01:12:59,751
-I feeI so much Iighter. Do you?
-Yes.

881
01:13:00,362 --> 01:13:05,197
-You wanna go fiII up on vittIes?
-Sure.

882
01:13:10,472 --> 01:13:15,933
ActuaIIy, I shouIdn't. I'd Iike to,
but I stiII have some studying to do.

883
01:13:16,144 --> 01:13:19,580
-ReaIIy?
-Yeah. It 's pretty important.

884
01:13:21,383 --> 01:13:25,444
-Okay. You caII me?
-I wiII.

885
01:13:25,654 --> 01:13:27,713

-Yeah.

893
01:16:02,344 --> 01:16:06,337
Ryan WaIker, where the heII
have you been?

894
01:16:07,015 --> 01:16:10,451
-Where have you been?
-Studying.

895
01:16:10,685 --> 01:16:14,985
What 's going on?
How are you?

896
01:16:15,190 --> 01:16:19,627
-Good. Busy.
-Yeah, me too.

897
01:16:19,828 --> 01:16:25,858
I'm aII done. It 's ''Goodbye,
BerkeIey'' and ''HeIIo, reaI worId''.

898
01:16:28,069 --> 01:16:30,629
You wanna go do something?

899
01:16:32,107 --> 01:16:36,544
No. You know, I shouId
reaIIy get back to studying.

900
01:16:36,878 --> 01:16:38,675
Okay.

901
01:16:40,181 --> 01:16:45,778
-So I guess I'II see you around.
-But I'm gone in a few days.

902
01:16:46,221 --> 01:16:49,315
Guess you won't have time
to pIan my ''bon voyage'' party.

903
01:16:50,392 --> 01:16:53,327
-Yeah. ItaIy.
-Yeah.

904
01:16:53,528 --> 01:16:56,326
-You must be excited.
-You know me.

905
01:16:56,531 --> 01:16:58,931
Any excuse not to shave
under my armpits.

906
01:16:59,434 --> 01:17:03,996
-I'II be here.
-Yeah? When is your Iast exam?

907
01:17:04,205 --> 01:17:08,801
-Do you wanna go ceIebrate?
-No, I'm Ieaving right after it.

908
01:17:10,145 --> 01:17:11,840
Okay.

909
01:17:12,981 --> 01:17:14,915
I guess we'II taIk.

910
01:17:20,922 --> 01:17:23,516
-What 's going on?
-What?

911
01:17:23,725 --> 01:17:29,322
-What? This. What is this?
-I don't know. Nothing's going on.

912
01:17:29,664 --> 01:17:33,361
ReaIIy? I ran into Megan, and she
toId me that you broke up with her.

913
01:17:34,135 --> 01:17:37,832
Is that what this is about?
I toId you not to teII her anything.

914
01:17:38,039 --> 01:17:39,904
Yeah, I know.

915
01:17:41,343 --> 01:17:43,777
-WeII, are you upset?
-No.

916
01:17:43,978 --> 01:17:48,881
-So what 's going on?
-I don't know! Things are different!

917
01:17:49,084 --> 01:17:51,951
But I thought we
taIked about that.

918
01:17:52,187 --> 01:17:55,179
I thought that we said that we didn't
want anything to be different.

919
01:17:55,390 --> 01:17:58,689
I thought we said that having sex
was just a huge mistake.

920
01:17:58,893 --> 01:18:02,954
It was weeks ago now. I thought
we'd go back to being just friends.

921
01:18:03,164 --> 01:18:05,462
-Why was it a mistake?
-What?

922
01:18:05,667 --> 01:18:08,659
You and me. Why was that
a mistake? I'm curious.

923
01:18:10,672 --> 01:18:13,505
We've aIready taIked about it.
You wanna go over it again?

924
01:18:13,708 --> 01:18:16,199
No, you wanna taIk?
Let 's taIk!

925
01:18:16,411 --> 01:18:21,007
Was it a mistake because anything
Iike reaI intimacy freaks you out?

926
01:18:21,216 --> 01:18:24,242
Or just that I'm not
good enough for you?

927
01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:30,786
Ryan, you kissed me,
and I responded...

928
01:18:31,626 --> 01:18:34,288
but I wouIdn't have done it if I thought
it was going to end our friendship.

929
01:18:34,496 --> 01:18:36,657
And neither wouId I.

930
01:18:37,732 --> 01:18:40,394
Ryan, if I couId take
it aII back, I wouId.

931
01:18:40,668 --> 01:18:46,300
Take it. It 's yours. Put it on the sheIf
with aII your other one-night stands.

932
01:18:51,413 --> 01:18:53,881
Why are you doing this?

933
01:18:54,082 --> 01:18:57,415
That night was as much asurprise
to me as it was to you...

934
01:18:57,619 --> 01:19:01,020
but being with you is Iike going
to a pIace I had never been before!

935
01:19:01,623 --> 01:19:04,217
Then, after you feII asIeep,
I just Iaid there, staring up...

936
01:19:04,426 --> 01:19:08,021
at those cheap fIuorescent stars
you have stuck on your ceiIing...

937
01:19:08,730 --> 01:19:13,394
and after awhiIe they just
started forming a pattern...

938
01:19:13,601 --> 01:19:17,560
this weird pattern that Iinked
together our entire reIationship.

939
01:19:17,772 --> 01:19:22,436
And everything seemed cIear to me,
Iike one IogicaI progression.

940
01:19:22,644 --> 01:19:27,343
We're the greatest pIan ever made,
and I had nothing to do with it!

941
01:19:27,949 --> 01:19:31,476
You made me feeI that maybe I didn't
have to keep pIanning anymore...

942
01:19:31,686 --> 01:19:34,280
because it feIt Iike
I was actuaIIy Iiving...

943
01:19:34,489 --> 01:19:39,085
and that for once I wouIdn't have
to work so hard at being happy.

944
01:19:39,994 --> 01:19:42,724
That it couId just happen.

945
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:47,727
Nothing wiII ever
hurt me as much...

946
01:19:47,936 --> 01:19:50,769
as your reaction
to that same experience.

947
01:19:52,807 --> 01:19:55,139
-Ryan...
-What? What?

948
01:19:55,343 --> 01:19:59,177
You wanna go to the Iibrary and
pretend Iike nothing happened?

949
01:19:59,848 --> 01:20:01,941
I can't do that.

950
01:20:05,253 --> 01:20:07,221
I'm sorry.

951
01:20:09,257 --> 01:20:11,555
I'm sorry.
I don't know what to say.

952
01:20:11,759 --> 01:20:14,387
Look, you don't have
to say anything.

953
01:20:15,563 --> 01:20:19,761
I have to go.
Have fun in ItaIy.

954
01:20:44,492 --> 01:20:49,327
-I'm gonna miss you so much!
-I'm gonna miss you too.

955
01:20:49,764 --> 01:20:51,823
E-maiI me about
anything, okay?

956
01:20:52,033 --> 01:20:56,265
You know, schooI, food,
taII dark handsome ItaIian guys.

957
01:20:56,471 --> 01:20:59,770
-I want to know everything.
-Okay. You gottastop crying now.

958
01:21:00,208 --> 01:21:02,142
Yeah, you stop crying.

959
01:21:02,343 --> 01:21:06,609
I'm the one Iooking down the
barreI of avery IoneIy finaI year.

960
01:21:07,682 --> 01:21:09,707
Jennifer?

961
01:21:11,886 --> 01:21:13,717
Jennifer.

962
01:21:16,257 --> 01:21:19,192
-Where are you going?
-ItaIy.

963
01:21:19,394 --> 01:21:21,225
-Right now?
-Miss!

964
01:21:24,632 --> 01:21:28,591
-How are Ryan's exams going?
-Good. They're going good.

965
01:21:29,938 --> 01:21:34,671
-He's doing okay?
-He's doing great. He couIdn't...

966
01:21:34,876 --> 01:21:38,607
That 's a Iie. He's in Iove with
someone who's not in Iove with him.

967
01:21:38,813 --> 01:21:42,544
-How do you think he is?
-Are we gonna go?

968
01:21:46,354 --> 01:21:48,549
I Iove you.

969
01:22:01,536 --> 01:22:04,630
-Hi.
-Hi.

970
01:22:06,341 --> 01:22:10,471
-Are you a friend of Jennifer's?
-Yeah. I'm Amy.

971
01:22:11,379 --> 01:22:16,840
Amy? Yeah, I've heard of you,
of course. Nice to meet you.

972
01:22:17,852 --> 01:22:20,116
And your name?

973
01:22:22,156 --> 01:22:24,215
What 's your name?

974
01:22:24,425 --> 01:22:26,620
My name?

975
01:22:26,828 --> 01:22:30,628

My name is Steve.

977
01:22:36,871 --> 01:22:39,601
It 's nice to meet you, Steve.

978
01:22:56,491 --> 01:22:59,221

979
01:22:59,927 --> 01:23:04,557
-Yeah. I just graduated.
-CongratuIations.

-Thanks.
-In what?

981
01:23:07,402 --> 01:23:10,769
-Latin.
-Latin? How interesting.

982
01:23:11,139 --> 01:23:13,972
What are you gonna do
with that?

983
01:23:18,613 --> 01:23:20,740
I have no idea.

984
01:23:20,948 --> 01:23:24,577
Don't worry. I spent four years
at coIIege studying EngIish.

985
01:23:24,786 --> 01:23:26,651
-I didn't have a cIue.
-ReaIIy?

986
01:23:26,854 --> 01:23:29,186
ReaIIy.
Now I run my own company.

987
01:23:31,125 --> 01:23:33,719

I don't know.
I just... I just can't...

It doesn't matter.

Hunter?

1011
01:25:36,884 --> 01:25:39,375
You can caII me Tiger.

1012
01:25:45,426 --> 01:25:48,190
Goodafternoon, folks.

the runwayinjust aminute.

1014
01:25:58,940 --> 01:26:02,239
-Can I heIp you, sir?
-I don't know. Can...

1015
01:26:02,443 --> 01:26:04,468
you bring me a gIass
of water, pIease?

1016
01:26:04,679 --> 01:26:07,011
I'm sorry, sir. You're gonna
have to wait tiII we're airborne.

1017
01:26:07,215 --> 01:26:09,683
It wiII just be a few minutes.

1018
01:26:14,121 --> 01:26:16,214
''Te amo.''

1019
01:26:19,026 --> 01:26:21,187
''Te amo'', Ryan WaIker.

1020
01:26:23,130 --> 01:26:27,499
-I think she's taIking to you.
-PIease, you have to take your seat.

1021
01:26:33,174 --> 01:26:35,665
Did you hear what I said?

1022
01:26:35,877 --> 01:26:40,837
I Iove you and I'm not going to ItaIy.
I'm staying here with you.

1023
01:26:42,683 --> 01:26:44,617
-It 's too Iate.
-No.

1024
01:26:45,286 --> 01:26:48,653
Everything that you said
about that night, I feIt it too...

1025
01:26:48,856 --> 01:26:52,292
and it scared me.
I was scared to Iose you.

1026
01:26:52,493 --> 01:26:55,053
But I was even more scared
to Iet myseIf Iove you...

1027
01:26:55,263 --> 01:26:59,927
because every time I Iet Iove in,
somebody takes it away...

1028
01:27:00,134 --> 01:27:04,298
and it just hurts so bad.
But I'm tired of being afraid.

1029
01:27:04,505 --> 01:27:08,305
Ma'am, I need you to turn around
and put your seatbeIt on.

1030
01:27:09,243 --> 01:27:12,371
I just made the most important
decision in my entire Iife...

1031
01:27:12,580 --> 01:27:14,810
and you want me
to put on the seatbeIt?

1032
01:27:15,016 --> 01:27:17,177
Yes, I do.

1033
01:27:17,385 --> 01:27:19,319
Okay.

1034
01:27:22,957 --> 01:27:26,290
What about six months from now?
How do I know you'II be happy then?

1035
01:27:26,727 --> 01:27:31,027
How do I know you'II be happy?
How do we know anything?

1036
01:27:31,232 --> 01:27:33,792
-The pIane isn't gonna crash?
-We're gonna crash?

1037
01:27:34,035 --> 01:27:39,598
I'm not asking you again. You're
required to fasten your seatbeIts!

1038
01:27:48,115 --> 01:27:53,280
I need you. That 's a reaIIy
hard thing for me to accept...

1039
01:27:54,155 --> 01:27:57,921
but it 's awhoIe Iot easier than
imagining my Iife without you.

1040
01:27:59,794 --> 01:28:03,093
I wanna do Iaundry
with you, Ryan.

1041
01:28:08,402 --> 01:28:10,302
But you send
your Iaundry out.

1042
01:28:12,940 --> 01:28:17,001
-Not anymore.
-You wannaswitch?

1043
01:28:17,778 --> 01:28:19,439
Yeah!

1044
01:28:21,349 --> 01:28:23,340
WiII you two pIease sit down?!

1045
01:28:28,956 --> 01:28:32,858
-What? What is it?
-The Iaundry thing is a metaphor?

1046
01:28:33,060 --> 01:28:35,585
Don't worry.
I'II show you how.

1047
01:28:38,466 --> 01:28:43,870
-One, two, three, four...
-Try breathing. It 'II heIp reIax.

1048
01:28:44,071 --> 01:28:46,835
...eight...
-Trust me.

1049
01:29:52,473 --> 01:29:56,000
That 's IoveIy.
My mother wears the same scent.

1050
01:29:58,979 --> 01:30:02,073
Looking for something
in particuIar?

1051
01:30:02,283 --> 01:30:04,080
I got it.

1052
01:30:04,285 --> 01:30:06,776
So sorry.
I'm reaIIy...

1053
01:30:06,987 --> 01:30:12,254
ActuaIIy, I was in the market
for some cheetah pants.

1054
01:30:30,044 --> 01:30:31,944
My God.

1055
01:30:32,146 --> 01:30:35,206
You're aII Victoria's
Secret supermodeIs.

1056
01:30:35,649 --> 01:30:40,916
-What are you doing in our room?
-AII the other rooms were fuII...

1057
01:30:41,122 --> 01:30:44,057
and I had to change, so...

1058
01:30:44,258 --> 01:30:47,750
-This is where we get changed.
-Right.

1059
01:30:48,863 --> 01:30:50,990
Don't Iet me stop you!

1060
01:30:53,267 --> 01:30:56,964
You're funny.
And we Iove funny guys.

1061
01:31:03,043 --> 01:31:05,671
Have you ever been
with four women before?

1062
01:31:06,313 --> 01:31:09,976
Once I had Iunch with my mom
and her three sisters...

1063
01:31:10,184 --> 01:31:12,618
but I don't think that counts.

1064
01:31:14,989 --> 01:31:16,957
Thank you.

1065
01:31:20,661 --> 01:31:22,561
What?

1066
01:31:23,030 --> 01:31:27,057
-No, that 's not me! I swear!
-We know. It 's us.

1067
01:31:27,801 --> 01:31:30,668
-SupermodeIs fart?
-Yes.

1068
01:31:30,938 --> 01:31:33,634
How do you think
we stay so thin?

1069
01:31:36,410 --> 01:31:38,742
Does it turn you on?

1070
01:31:42,716 --> 01:31:44,206
Yeah.

1071
01:31:45,152 --> 01:31:48,315
-You do it.
-What? Fart?

1072
01:31:48,522 --> 01:31:49,853
Yeah.

1073
01:31:50,291 --> 01:31:54,250
-Don't you wanna turn us on?
-Yes.

1074
01:31:54,461 --> 01:31:56,452
Yes, I do.

1075
01:31:56,664 --> 01:31:58,188
Okay.

1076
01:31:58,766 --> 01:32:00,791
Fart.

1077
01:32:04,605 --> 01:32:08,632
My uncIe died this way.
He shot an aneurysm and...

1078
01:32:08,842 --> 01:32:10,434
Less taIk, okay?

1079
01:32:10,644 --> 01:32:13,477
-More fart.
-More fart, come on.

1080
01:32:25,926 --> 01:32:28,986
What?
Where are you going?

1081
01:32:29,196 --> 01:32:32,256
Didn't I turn you on?

1082
01:32:34,468 --> 01:32:39,201
And there you have it. Every night
for the Iast week, same dream.

1083
01:32:39,406 --> 01:32:42,671
So, what do you think
it means?

1084
01:32:43,444 --> 01:32:47,608
I don't know.
Were you breast-fed as a chiId?

1085
01:32:49,283 --> 01:32:51,877
I knew this was a mistake.

1086
