1
00:03:50,787 --> 00:03:52,618
Hey, driver.

2
00:03:52,789 --> 00:03:55,155
Oh, happy Easter, Excellency.

3
00:03:55,325 --> 00:03:57,623
What is it you want, Stepal?
Could you drive to the Casbick

4
00:03:57,794 --> 00:03:59,694
And ask General Boynin
to come here immediately?

5
00:03:59,863 --> 00:04:03,196
Isn't it too late for the church
to save that master of yours?

6
00:04:03,366 --> 00:04:05,527
25 francs.
No. 10.

7
00:04:05,702 --> 00:04:09,331
On Easter night, 20.
15, Excellency.

8
00:04:09,506 --> 00:04:12,270
All right, Stepal. Happy Easter to you.

9
00:04:12,442 --> 00:04:13,466
Please, hurry.

10
00:04:13,643 --> 00:04:19,138
Leave it to me.
It's very urgent. Please.

11
00:04:37,133 --> 00:04:38,998
Don't you adore Russian food?

12
00:04:39,169 --> 00:04:41,194
Faster.

13
00:04:41,371 --> 00:04:43,566
Faster!

14
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:46,208
Faster!
General,

15
00:04:46,376 --> 00:04:47,741
I'm just mad for your place.

16
00:04:47,911 --> 00:04:50,311
It's always a pleasure
to see you here, Madame.

17
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,573
General Boynin, my husband.

18
00:04:52,749 --> 00:04:53,977
Excuse me, general.

19
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:56,550
The count Periosov
is waiting outside in his taxi.

20
00:04:56,719 --> 00:04:58,084
He has a message for you.
From Stepal?

21
00:04:58,254 --> 00:05:00,119
Yes. He says it is urgent.

22
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:02,224
I'll be right out.

23
00:05:02,392 --> 00:05:08,388
Will you forgive me for just a moment?

24
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:53,869
Is she here?
Yes, sir.

25
00:05:54,043 --> 00:05:58,537
Where?
Over there by the tree.

26
00:05:59,048 --> 00:06:01,346
Are you sure?
Yes, Excellency.

27
00:06:01,518 --> 00:06:05,386
All right. Wait here.

28
00:06:05,555 --> 00:06:07,352
Happy Easter.

29
00:06:07,524 --> 00:06:09,492
Happy Easter, Anna Corev.

30
00:06:09,659 --> 00:06:10,853
It is Anna Corev?

31
00:06:11,027 --> 00:06:14,724
Or at least so you were called
in the asylum at St. Cluv.

32
00:06:14,898 --> 00:06:16,422
You see the resemblance?

33
00:06:16,599 --> 00:06:21,002
No more than 100 women might have.

34
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:22,967
There is nothing to fear. I promise you.

35
00:06:23,139 --> 00:06:24,572
Why do you always run away?

36
00:06:24,741 --> 00:06:27,369
Always questions.
I have lost the answers.

37
00:06:27,544 --> 00:06:28,977
Perhaps if you hadn't told
a nun who you were,

38
00:06:29,145 --> 00:06:30,373
There wouldn't be any questions.

39
00:06:30,547 --> 00:06:35,041
Who am I?
Grand Duchess Anastasia, I believe.

40
00:06:35,318 --> 00:06:37,286
In an asylum, a nun might be mad.

41
00:06:37,453 --> 00:06:38,215
It's contagious.

42
00:06:38,388 --> 00:06:44,816
Then you do admit you were
in that asylum, don't you?

43
00:06:44,994 --> 00:06:46,928
Stepal, are you positive

44
00:06:47,096 --> 00:06:48,961
She is the same woman
you saw in St, Cluv?

45
00:06:49,132 --> 00:06:50,759
Yes, sir.

46
00:06:50,934 --> 00:06:53,926
Come on.

47
00:09:55,351 --> 00:10:00,880
Let me go. Please, let me go.

48
00:10:01,057 --> 00:10:04,254
The general said to wait for him
at the usual place.

49
00:10:04,427 --> 00:10:06,486
Wait! How do you like that?

50
00:10:06,662 --> 00:10:09,324
The nerve of that Boynin.
Didn't he leave us a message?

51
00:10:09,499 --> 00:10:15,062
Yes. He said he'd be back shortly.
Late. Always late.

52
00:10:15,238 --> 00:10:16,933
Petrovin, the hour has arrived for me...

53
00:10:17,106 --> 00:10:19,370
I know.

54
00:10:19,542 --> 00:10:22,170
You only tell me
what you are going to tell Boynin.

55
00:10:22,345 --> 00:10:24,609
Still, be happy now.

56
00:10:24,781 --> 00:10:26,749
In one week, you shall be
telling it in prison.

57
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:29,544
Petrovin, I forbid that word.

58
00:10:29,719 --> 00:10:30,583
I didn't hear it.

59
00:10:30,753 --> 00:10:33,551
It's the logical end to what
was always a ridiculous scheme.

60
00:10:33,723 --> 00:10:35,384
Ridiculous scheme, huh?

61
00:10:35,558 --> 00:10:37,753
Well, your eyes lit up
like those of a mad monk

62
00:10:37,927 --> 00:10:40,191
When you heard our tsar's daughter
might be alive.

63
00:10:40,363 --> 00:10:40,727
That was ridiculous.

64
00:10:40,897 --> 00:10:44,128
And yours lit up when you heard
he had a 1o million inheritance.

65
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,494
Equally ridiculous.

66
00:10:45,668 --> 00:10:46,692
Not equally.

67
00:10:46,869 --> 00:10:49,667
The 1o million lie waiting
in The Bank of England,

68
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:53,366
But the Grand Duchess Anastasia
Nikolayevna lies buried in Russia.

69
00:10:53,543 --> 00:10:55,010
Vodka?
No, thank you.

70
00:10:55,178 --> 00:10:55,940
My indigestion has been shocking

71
00:10:56,112 --> 00:10:58,672
Ever since Boynin decided to
form our corporation.

72
00:10:58,848 --> 00:11:01,339
Boynin decided? The idea was mine.

73
00:11:01,517 --> 00:11:04,782
My years of banking experience
are for nothing?

74
00:11:04,954 --> 00:11:07,582
I devised the method of
setting Shestu stockholders

75
00:11:07,757 --> 00:11:11,124
To pay for the search for
their beloved grand duchess.

76
00:11:11,294 --> 00:11:14,058
I worked out the ratio
of so many shares in her inheritance

77
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:16,027
To so many shares of our stock,

78
00:11:16,199 --> 00:11:18,224
And I... I know, Boynin was nothing.

79
00:11:18,401 --> 00:11:21,427
Boynin was nothing.

80
00:11:21,604 --> 00:11:23,469
Good evening, comrades.

81
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:26,267
The term doesn't grate
on your white Russian ears.

82
00:11:26,442 --> 00:11:27,431
Huh?
Excuse me.

83
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:30,238
Oh, I'm sorry.
The meeting is called to order.

84
00:11:30,413 --> 00:11:31,573
Called to order? Just like that?

85
00:11:31,747 --> 00:11:33,305
May we have the financial report,
please?

86
00:11:33,482 --> 00:11:35,109
The financial...
Yes, the financial report.

87
00:11:35,284 --> 00:11:36,216
There's another report, general.

88
00:11:36,385 --> 00:11:38,615
All in due time, Petrovanch.
Go ahead, Chernov.

89
00:11:38,788 --> 00:11:42,918
As of today,
our treasury shows assets...

90
00:11:43,092 --> 00:11:46,289
Of... here... exactly 5,25o francs.

91
00:11:46,462 --> 00:11:48,327
That new suit looks very well on you,
my dear Chernov.

92
00:11:48,497 --> 00:11:49,725
Am I wrong, or were there not

93
00:11:49,899 --> 00:11:52,060
Some 9,ooo-odd francs
at our last meeting?

94
00:11:52,235 --> 00:11:54,499
My dear general, may I ask you...

95
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:57,264
May I ask you what paid
for this club of yours?

96
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,341
15,ooo francs from the stockholders,
that's what.

97
00:12:00,509 --> 00:12:02,500
We live in one room,
Petrovin and I. Two.

98
00:12:02,678 --> 00:12:03,838
We share the bedroom.

99
00:12:04,013 --> 00:12:05,537
This is not a meeting
on your housing problem.

100
00:12:05,715 --> 00:12:10,778
Proceed with our accounts.
Housing problem. Hmmph!

101
00:12:10,953 --> 00:12:13,820
275 francs to Natalia Kovski,

102
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:16,458
Formerly dressmaker
of the imperial family,

103
00:12:16,626 --> 00:12:19,493
Paid for the information I received
on clothes and measurements.

104
00:12:19,662 --> 00:12:21,220
I see you've made good use
of the information.

105
00:12:21,397 --> 00:12:23,627
I drew it myself.
Those are her exact measurements.

106
00:12:23,799 --> 00:12:27,462
The crown is a nice touch.
Yeah. A face would be a better one.

107
00:12:27,637 --> 00:12:29,832
It's all too late now.
We're facing disaster.

108
00:12:30,006 --> 00:12:32,600
As a son of the former deacon
to His Majesty's court,

109
00:12:32,775 --> 00:12:33,901
You should have more faith.

110
00:12:34,076 --> 00:12:37,045
I wish my poor father,
bless his soul, had had less.

111
00:12:37,213 --> 00:12:39,613
All right, Chernov. Please,
give him the news.

112
00:12:39,782 --> 00:12:41,841
I would rather have his first.

113
00:12:42,018 --> 00:12:44,282
Mine?
I know that smile.

114
00:12:44,453 --> 00:12:47,752
I'll bet you have another
Of your brilliant surprises for us.

115
00:12:47,924 --> 00:12:49,391
Never mind. What happened, Petrovin?

116
00:12:49,558 --> 00:12:52,789
Chernov... I was summoned by
the stockholders' committee.

117
00:12:52,962 --> 00:12:54,554
Oh? How kind of them.

118
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:55,958
Kind, eh?

119
00:12:56,132 --> 00:12:58,623
The old General Anikin
came straight to the point.

120
00:12:58,801 --> 00:13:00,063
"Years ago," he said,

121
00:13:00,236 --> 00:13:03,933
"Rumors started that the Grand Duchess
Anastasia Nikolayevna,

122
00:13:04,106 --> 00:13:06,404
"Daughter of His Imperial Majesty
Nicholas II,

123
00:13:06,575 --> 00:13:09,169
"Had not been murdered
with the rest of the royal family,

124
00:13:09,345 --> 00:13:11,370
"But had escaped miraculously.

125
00:13:11,547 --> 00:13:13,014
A year ago," he went on,

126
00:13:13,182 --> 00:13:15,173
"You and your friends
came to us with a claim

127
00:13:15,351 --> 00:13:17,945
"You knew Her Highness
was somewhere in Berlin.

128
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,384
Then you said you found her,
but she ran away."

129
00:13:20,556 --> 00:13:22,217
Was it then we thought
of using the redhead?

130
00:13:22,391 --> 00:13:23,722
No. No. The one who was always giggling.

131
00:13:23,893 --> 00:13:25,952
Ah, yes. The redhead came later.
Go ahead.

132
00:13:26,128 --> 00:13:29,063
Then he said,
"you needed more money to find her.

133
00:13:29,231 --> 00:13:30,789
"Again we subscribed.

134
00:13:30,967 --> 00:13:35,233
"Then you said you found her,
but she was too sick.

135
00:13:35,404 --> 00:13:36,928
More money."
Too sick? That was galena... too stupid.

136
00:13:37,106 --> 00:13:38,539
"How long can she be sick, Chernov?

137
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:41,233
How much money can you drain
from our thin pockets, Chernov?"

138
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:42,377
How much have they got, Chernov?

139
00:13:42,545 --> 00:13:46,140
The joke is on us, general.
They give us exactly eight days.

140
00:13:46,315 --> 00:13:47,407
Eight days for what?

141
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:50,484
Eight days to produce Her Highness,
the Grand Duchess Anastasia.

142
00:13:50,653 --> 00:13:54,680
Or we go to prison for fraud!
Well, it has taken them long enough.

143
00:13:54,857 --> 00:13:55,755
Is that all you can say?

144
00:13:55,925 --> 00:13:57,916
It sickens me how you
let him make you suffer.

145
00:13:58,094 --> 00:13:59,254
How you like to suffer,

146
00:13:59,428 --> 00:14:02,397
And you delight in making him suffer.
Not particularly.

147
00:14:02,565 --> 00:14:04,590
I merely thought it
advisable to determine

148
00:14:04,767 --> 00:14:06,564
Exactly what our situation was

149
00:14:06,736 --> 00:14:08,169
Before suggesting how to deal with it.

150
00:14:08,337 --> 00:14:10,703
What did I tell you? All right,
general, let's have your surprise.

151
00:14:10,873 --> 00:14:11,965
Where is she?
Where is who?

152
00:14:12,141 --> 00:14:14,439
The woman Stepal saw
in the asylum at St. Cluv.

153
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:16,840
Correct.
We have finally tracked her down.

154
00:14:17,013 --> 00:14:18,173
Really?

155
00:14:18,347 --> 00:14:19,974
Of course, she does not admit
that she was there.

156
00:14:20,149 --> 00:14:21,138
Really?

157
00:14:21,317 --> 00:14:23,342
Nor does she admit that
she told a nun there

158
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,544
That she was the tsar's daughter.
What does she admit?

159
00:14:25,721 --> 00:14:27,188
Nothing.
Then why do you believe...

160
00:14:27,356 --> 00:14:29,324
I think she may be lying,
But the important thing is that,

161
00:14:29,492 --> 00:14:31,289
Properly used,
she may serve our purpose.

162
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:34,122
How?
She has certain surprising features.

163
00:14:34,296 --> 00:14:35,092
Such as?

164
00:14:35,264 --> 00:14:39,633
You will see. She also has
a rather intriguing strangeness

165
00:14:39,802 --> 00:14:42,134
Of course, that may simply be
the result of amnesia.

166
00:14:42,304 --> 00:14:43,601
Him and his surprises.

167
00:14:43,773 --> 00:14:47,174
If he were looking for a grand duke,
he wouldn't find so many.

168
00:14:47,343 --> 00:14:48,435
Stepal,

169
00:14:48,611 --> 00:14:51,603
Bring her in.

170
00:14:53,616 --> 00:14:57,609
Come over here.

171
00:15:00,356 --> 00:15:04,850
Don't worry.
These two gentlemen are friends.

172
00:15:07,863 --> 00:15:11,458
Here. Sit down.

173
00:15:11,634 --> 00:15:14,296
How about a glass of vodka?
It will do you good.

174
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:17,462
Thank you.

175
00:15:18,274 --> 00:15:20,742
There's nothing to fear.
They merely want to examine you.

176
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:23,470
Examine? Are they doctors?

177
00:15:23,646 --> 00:15:27,776
Well, they don't help.
Doctors? No, they are not doctors.

178
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:30,248
No. No. We should have kept the redhead.

179
00:15:30,419 --> 00:15:32,887
That tsar's daughter
drinks like a cossack.

180
00:15:33,055 --> 00:15:39,551
May I have a cigarette?
Sure. Here.

181
00:15:44,567 --> 00:15:47,502
Where am I?
I told you, with friends.

182
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:49,365
Strange.
What?

183
00:15:49,538 --> 00:15:52,871
The resemblance to the other.
Yes, both female.

184
00:15:53,042 --> 00:15:55,169
Have you gentlemen considered
what she went through?

185
00:15:55,344 --> 00:15:57,141
The streets, probably.

186
00:15:57,313 --> 00:15:59,213
I can imagine her walk.

187
00:15:59,381 --> 00:16:00,780
Stand up.

188
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:04,545
What did you say?
Oh, ho ho! I said stand up.

189
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,278
We would like to see you
walk over to there,

190
00:16:06,455 --> 00:16:09,447
If you please.

191
00:16:14,163 --> 00:16:15,391
No. At least with the redhead,

192
00:16:15,564 --> 00:16:18,226
We could have dyed her hair,
but a walk...

193
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,560
The grand duchesses learned

194
00:16:19,735 --> 00:16:21,032
With books on their heads.

195
00:16:21,203 --> 00:16:26,334
You could recognize them
by their carriage alone.

196
00:16:26,509 --> 00:16:29,137
Stone walls.
What's she talking about?

197
00:16:29,311 --> 00:16:31,939
Chernov, that bookkeeper
who nearly ruined you

198
00:16:32,114 --> 00:16:33,638
12 years ago in the forgery affair,

199
00:16:33,816 --> 00:16:35,477
Would you recognize his walk today?

200
00:16:35,651 --> 00:16:38,017
Would you recognize the smile
of a girl you knew 1o years ago?

201
00:16:38,187 --> 00:16:40,485
I didn't think of that.
You are both fools.

202
00:16:40,656 --> 00:16:42,749
You are examining her
as if she was the real Anastasia.

203
00:16:42,925 --> 00:16:44,552
There is no Anastasia.

204
00:16:44,727 --> 00:16:47,696
She was shot to death
1 years ago by a firing squad.

205
00:16:47,863 --> 00:16:49,592
We are not looking for her, gentlemen.

206
00:16:49,765 --> 00:16:51,960
We are seeking
only a reasonable facsimile.

207
00:16:52,134 --> 00:16:53,795
Reasonable, yes,
but that is unreasonable.

208
00:16:53,969 --> 00:16:55,630
Please, let's be constructive.

209
00:16:55,804 --> 00:16:57,169
Besides, what will the committee say?

210
00:16:57,339 --> 00:16:58,772
Most of them have seen the original.

211
00:16:58,941 --> 00:17:01,102
How? At a court ball from a balcony?

212
00:17:01,277 --> 00:17:03,643
In church by candlelight,
flickering shadows?

213
00:17:03,812 --> 00:17:05,609
Yes, you saw her. Many saw her

214
00:17:05,781 --> 00:17:07,544
From a distance or in the newspapers.
What about the servants?

215
00:17:07,716 --> 00:17:08,842
Some of them are here in exile.

216
00:17:09,018 --> 00:17:11,077
They saw her through devoted tears,
and they will again.

217
00:17:11,253 --> 00:17:12,311
All right. Then the family?

218
00:17:12,488 --> 00:17:13,284
The family?

219
00:17:13,455 --> 00:17:15,514
If it was the immediate family,
I would not try,

220
00:17:15,691 --> 00:17:16,589
But they are dead,

221
00:17:16,759 --> 00:17:19,193
And do you have faith in the memories
of uncles, aunts, cousins?

222
00:17:19,361 --> 00:17:21,022
I don't.
You have faith in nothing.

223
00:17:21,197 --> 00:17:23,062
They will closet themselves
in their bedrooms

224
00:17:23,232 --> 00:17:25,200
And secretly peer at yellow photographs

225
00:17:25,367 --> 00:17:25,958
Which that woman will resemble.

226
00:17:26,135 --> 00:17:27,864
That?
Yes, that.

227
00:17:28,037 --> 00:17:29,902
Rouge will turn the mouth up a bit.

228
00:17:30,072 --> 00:17:32,063
Some powder, a new coiffure,

229
00:17:32,241 --> 00:17:35,608
Dresses to suggest the other period,
walk, manner, voice

230
00:17:35,778 --> 00:17:38,372
Taught along with faces, names, places.

231
00:17:38,547 --> 00:17:39,514
It would be easier

232
00:17:39,682 --> 00:17:43,277
If I could present her to the committee
lying in her coffin.

233
00:17:43,452 --> 00:17:46,353
Yes... no questions, no answers,
no mistakes.

234
00:17:46,522 --> 00:17:49,753
No money, either.
I know. Now I know.

235
00:17:49,925 --> 00:17:52,052
Know what?
It's a cellar.

236
00:17:52,228 --> 00:17:53,456
You brought me down here to shoot me.

237
00:17:53,629 --> 00:17:54,755
Are you mad?
It's a cellar!

238
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:56,557
This is absurd. Sit down!
No.

239
00:17:56,732 --> 00:17:59,929
Sit down, I said!

240
00:18:00,102 --> 00:18:03,094
Ha ha ha! Pretty good. Pretty good.

241
00:18:03,272 --> 00:18:05,172
A little more rehearsal, perhaps.

242
00:18:05,341 --> 00:18:05,932
What?

243
00:18:06,108 --> 00:18:08,975
He told her how the real one
was shot in a cellar...

244
00:18:09,144 --> 00:18:11,772
Don't be stupid. I told her nothing.

245
00:18:11,947 --> 00:18:13,744
The woman can undoubtedly read,

246
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:15,008
And certainly enough has been written

247
00:18:15,184 --> 00:18:16,981
Describing their death in the cellar.

248
00:18:17,152 --> 00:18:20,178
Some say she did not die.

249
00:18:20,356 --> 00:18:22,119
Where did you get that?

250
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:24,384
He just said so... from a book,

251
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:27,620
Or a story I was told
or a rumor, a whisper.

252
00:18:27,796 --> 00:18:29,229
Or it... it happened.

253
00:18:29,398 --> 00:18:31,958
It did not, and that woman
is too something...

254
00:18:32,134 --> 00:18:34,295
Too crazy, too clever, too tricky.

255
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:37,166
I don't care what she is.
The important thing is that she fits.

256
00:18:37,339 --> 00:18:41,332
Get up. Go over there.

257
00:18:44,813 --> 00:18:49,079
What is it?
Just a drawing. Stand closer.

258
00:18:49,251 --> 00:18:52,243
Turn around.

259
00:18:53,956 --> 00:18:55,218
The correct height.

260
00:18:55,391 --> 00:19:00,886
The correct height.
Yes. The crown might belong on her head.

261
00:19:01,497 --> 00:19:04,523
A drawing of whom? Who is it?

262
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:08,397
A princess, a Russian grand duchess
who died in 1918.

263
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:13,064
A princess?
Ha ha ha ha!

264
00:19:16,011 --> 00:19:18,036
Petrovin, a glass of water.

265
00:19:18,213 --> 00:19:19,111
It's all right.

266
00:19:19,281 --> 00:19:22,341
It's all right, Petrovin.
Her Highness is better.

267
00:19:22,518 --> 00:19:25,146
Don't call me that!
How well you hear,

268
00:19:25,321 --> 00:19:27,812
And how well you know how to use
what you hear, and when.

269
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:29,048
It was you who told the nun

270
00:19:29,224 --> 00:19:30,714
That you were
the Grand Duchess Anastasia.

271
00:19:30,893 --> 00:19:32,224
Sick people get sick ideas.

272
00:19:32,394 --> 00:19:33,952
Then you were in that asylum
in St. Cluv.

273
00:19:34,129 --> 00:19:36,859
And before that, in Berlin.

274
00:19:37,032 --> 00:19:38,897
Let me out of here!
You know you were.

275
00:19:39,068 --> 00:19:40,865
You were, and you weren't.
Why and why not...

276
00:19:41,036 --> 00:19:43,436
Questions like that can only be
answered by lies! Let me go!

277
00:19:43,605 --> 00:19:47,598
Stop it! Stop it!

278
00:19:48,177 --> 00:19:50,338
No.
No.

279
00:19:50,512 --> 00:19:54,004
Please. Please.
Don't! Don't!

280
00:19:54,183 --> 00:19:55,775
Look at her hand.
What?

281
00:19:55,951 --> 00:19:59,785
Go on. Look.
Well, he wants us to look. All right.

282
00:19:59,955 --> 00:20:03,152
Come. Now, come under the light.

283
00:20:03,325 --> 00:20:05,350
Sit down.

284
00:20:05,527 --> 00:20:09,293
Open your hands.

285
00:20:09,465 --> 00:20:11,456
I told you there were
surprising features.

286
00:20:11,633 --> 00:20:14,500
On the palm of each hand, a scar.
As from bullets?

287
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:18,071
Now look at her head,
above the left temple...

288
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,765
A narrow depression extending
almost to the forehead.

289
00:20:20,943 --> 00:20:22,308
Just as we were told.

290
00:20:22,478 --> 00:20:25,345
Where did you get those scars?

291
00:20:25,514 --> 00:20:27,812
A gift from an unknown admirer.

292
00:20:27,983 --> 00:20:30,110
Where?

293
00:20:30,285 --> 00:20:31,582
I don't remember.

294
00:20:31,754 --> 00:20:33,779
Wounds like that,
and you don't remember?

295
00:20:33,956 --> 00:20:36,288
Who are you?

296
00:20:36,458 --> 00:20:38,392
No one.
Who are your parents?

297
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,425
None.
Where are you from?

298
00:20:40,596 --> 00:20:42,621
The river.
Before that?

299
00:20:42,798 --> 00:20:45,460
A madhouse.
And before that?

300
00:20:45,634 --> 00:20:49,468
Another river and another madhouse.
Come on, now. Who are you?

301
00:20:49,638 --> 00:20:52,072
You tell me.
You must be someone.

302
00:20:52,241 --> 00:20:53,731
Why?

303
00:20:53,909 --> 00:20:56,002
Nobody, nothing, no one.
Incredible.

304
00:20:56,178 --> 00:20:57,645
But most convenient for us.

305
00:20:57,813 --> 00:20:59,713
All right, gentlemen, come over here.

306
00:20:59,882 --> 00:21:01,179
Add up the facts...

307
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:03,716
One, she has a certain resemblance,
which we can heighten.

308
00:21:03,886 --> 00:21:07,617
Two, she's obviously smart enough
to learn what we teach.

309
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:10,020
Discrepancies in her memory
can be attributed to the head wound.

310
00:21:10,192 --> 00:21:13,161
Three, she has no identity whatsoever,

311
00:21:13,328 --> 00:21:14,989
Which means it will be
exceedingly difficult

312
00:21:15,164 --> 00:21:16,859
For anyone to prove that
she's someone else.

313
00:21:17,032 --> 00:21:18,363
Four...
We have eight days.

314
00:21:18,534 --> 00:21:21,230
Precisely. All in favor of
the candidate...

315
00:21:21,403 --> 00:21:24,497
Two to one. Elected.
Two to one. Elected.

316
00:21:24,673 --> 00:21:27,608
Do you realize there are
1o million at stake!

317
00:21:27,776 --> 00:21:29,903
1o million?
Yes, my dear.

318
00:21:30,078 --> 00:21:31,602
The inheritance of 1o million

319
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:34,010
Left by the tsar in The Bank of England,

320
00:21:34,183 --> 00:21:36,344
And you want to risk it on a madwoman.

321
00:21:36,518 --> 00:21:38,213
I must still be in the asylum

322
00:21:38,387 --> 00:21:40,753
With the one who sat covered
and crouched on the floor

323
00:21:40,923 --> 00:21:42,584
Because she wasn't born yet.

324
00:21:42,758 --> 00:21:45,420
It's you who are mad!
I'll have no part of this!

325
00:21:45,594 --> 00:21:46,686
Now, now, my dear.

326
00:21:46,862 --> 00:21:49,160
The carriage of the head
not quite so high.

327
00:21:49,331 --> 00:21:50,320
Grand duchesses are proud

328
00:21:50,499 --> 00:21:53,059
But also modest.
They are to be killed, not to be sold!

329
00:21:53,235 --> 00:21:55,931
There you are, mad as a hatter.

330
00:21:56,104 --> 00:21:58,038
Now she really thinks she is Anastasia.

331
00:21:58,207 --> 00:21:59,401
I do not. I am not.

332
00:21:59,575 --> 00:22:00,701
But you can be.
I can make you Anastasia.

333
00:22:00,876 --> 00:22:02,741
She's dead. You said so yourself.
That doesn't matter.

334
00:22:02,911 --> 00:22:04,310
Please. Please. No one will believe it.

335
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,606
The family, they call the lie.

336
00:22:05,781 --> 00:22:07,043
No matter what they think,
they will accept you.

337
00:22:07,216 --> 00:22:09,480
For 1o million, gladly.

338
00:22:09,651 --> 00:22:11,778
They would accept me
and pretend to love me for money?

339
00:22:11,954 --> 00:22:13,319
Is that what they are like?
Isn't everyone?

340
00:22:13,489 --> 00:22:16,356
No. I'm going.
Where? To the river or the madhouse?

341
00:22:16,525 --> 00:22:19,255
You have no papers.
The police will pick you up soon enough.

342
00:22:19,428 --> 00:22:22,829
If you don't die of starvation sooner.
Oh, come, come. Why, then,

343
00:22:22,998 --> 00:22:25,193
Did you tell those stories
in the hospital?

344
00:22:25,367 --> 00:22:27,062
To the little nun?

345
00:22:27,236 --> 00:22:30,728
Her eyes grew big as a child's,
but then in the evening,

346
00:22:30,906 --> 00:22:32,999
She brought me special things to eat...

347
00:22:33,175 --> 00:22:34,403
An orange or some grapes.

348
00:22:34,576 --> 00:22:35,804
We can bring you much more.

349
00:22:35,978 --> 00:22:38,071
But in another hospital,
I told other stories,

350
00:22:38,247 --> 00:22:40,181
And they believed them, too,

351
00:22:40,349 --> 00:22:43,113
Especially the one
where the train blew up.

352
00:22:43,285 --> 00:22:46,152
We were too close to
where the mine was planted,

353
00:22:46,321 --> 00:22:48,255
So when the train hit it,

354
00:22:48,423 --> 00:22:51,483
Pieces of metal fell
like a shower of fireworks

355
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:53,252
All about us.

356
00:22:53,428 --> 00:22:58,491
The man beside me was killed,
and the man beside him, too,

357
00:22:58,667 --> 00:23:00,396
But I was only wounded.

358
00:23:00,569 --> 00:23:04,767
Oh, so that's how you got those scars.

359
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:06,464
Yes. So it would seem.

360
00:23:06,642 --> 00:23:09,008
I thought you couldn't remember.

361
00:23:09,177 --> 00:23:14,444
I can't always. Things come and go,
like waves of mist.

362
00:23:14,616 --> 00:23:16,777
But, look, to be her is what you want,
what we want,

363
00:23:16,952 --> 00:23:19,216
Even what the royal family wants.

364
00:23:19,388 --> 00:23:21,322
So I've heard before. All of it...

365
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:23,549
"Say this. Remember that.
You are. You are not.

366
00:23:23,725 --> 00:23:25,249
I know you, I don't know you."

367
00:23:25,427 --> 00:23:28,055
Oh, I've heard it many times.
Where?

368
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:29,857
Bucharest, Berlin...

369
00:23:30,032 --> 00:23:30,498
Berlin?

370
00:23:30,666 --> 00:23:35,069
Or china! I don't remember,
but the enthusiasm and the promise,

371
00:23:35,237 --> 00:23:39,105
It's those I remember,
and then when memory failed,

372
00:23:39,274 --> 00:23:43,335
Disappointment, anger, dismissal.

373
00:23:43,512 --> 00:23:47,380
Out in the street...
failure! Fake! Nobody!

374
00:23:47,549 --> 00:23:48,538
There you are wrong.

375
00:23:48,717 --> 00:23:50,651
There will not be failure this time,
not with me.

376
00:23:50,819 --> 00:23:56,155
Now, listen, you want to know
who you are, don't you?

377
00:23:56,325 --> 00:23:57,257
Oh, yes.

378
00:23:57,426 --> 00:24:01,294
You want to find the family
to whom you belong, don't you?

379
00:24:01,463 --> 00:24:03,624
Yes. Yes.

380
00:24:03,799 --> 00:24:06,393
By yourself, you are lost,
but with me, you'll find yourself.

381
00:24:06,568 --> 00:24:08,263
Oh, please. I'm tired.

382
00:24:08,437 --> 00:24:09,426
You know I am right.

383
00:24:09,605 --> 00:24:12,938
The album... take the chance.
It's the only one you have.

384
00:24:13,108 --> 00:24:14,370
I'm too tired to argue.

385
00:24:14,543 --> 00:24:21,039
You don't have to do anything.
I will do it all. Now, here, look.

386
00:24:21,216 --> 00:24:23,741
It's you on the deck
of your father's yacht.

387
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:26,012
The Standart.
The Standart?

388
00:24:26,188 --> 00:24:27,951
You know the name?

389
00:24:28,123 --> 00:24:30,148
It's written on the lifeboat.

390
00:24:30,325 --> 00:24:33,317
Oh, yes.
Now, here you are with your family...

391
00:24:33,495 --> 00:24:36,157
Your father the tsar,
your mother, your sisters,

392
00:24:36,331 --> 00:24:38,925
Your little brother.
My family.

393
00:24:39,101 --> 00:24:40,591
And here...

394
00:24:40,769 --> 00:24:42,794
Look.

395
00:24:42,971 --> 00:24:45,633
1913, the anniversary
of the house of Romanov...

396
00:24:45,807 --> 00:24:47,138
3oo years.

397
00:24:47,309 --> 00:24:49,834
There they are on the balcony
of the winter palace,

398
00:24:50,012 --> 00:24:53,140
And that little girl there, that is you.

399
00:24:53,315 --> 00:24:54,373
Thousands kneeling.

400
00:24:54,549 --> 00:24:56,176
Singing god save the tsar.

401
00:24:56,351 --> 00:24:58,751
The people. Your people.

402
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,319
Yes.

403
00:25:00,489 --> 00:25:03,390
You can see it, can't you?
Yes, I can.

404
00:25:03,558 --> 00:25:05,355
Now, may I present your staff?

405
00:25:05,527 --> 00:25:08,394
Belis Andreis Chernov,
formerly of St. Petersburg,

406
00:25:08,563 --> 00:25:10,190
Banker.

407
00:25:10,365 --> 00:25:14,426
Petrovanch Petrovin, former student
of the theological seminary.

408
00:25:14,603 --> 00:25:17,697
Sergei Pavlovich Boynin,
general of the Chekist regiment,

409
00:25:17,873 --> 00:25:18,635
Former aide-de-camp

410
00:25:18,807 --> 00:25:21,469
Attached to the person
of His Imperial Majesty Nicholas II,

411
00:25:21,643 --> 00:25:24,544
Tsar of all Russia.

412
00:25:24,713 --> 00:25:26,305
And I am...

413
00:25:26,481 --> 00:25:29,279
I am Her Imperial Highness,

414
00:25:29,451 --> 00:25:32,511
The Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolayevna.

415
00:25:32,688 --> 00:25:36,681
Ha ha ha ha ha!

416
00:25:47,502 --> 00:25:50,369
Now, once more.

417
00:25:50,539 --> 00:25:52,404
Awakened in the middle of the night

418
00:25:52,574 --> 00:25:55,509
And taken down to the cellar...
And then, without warning...

419
00:25:55,677 --> 00:25:59,511
Guards appeared in the doorway
and began firing,

420
00:25:59,681 --> 00:26:02,707
But one fainted, shielded
by the body of her sister...

421
00:26:02,884 --> 00:26:04,647
Which sister?

422
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:07,050
Was it Olga?
Right.

423
00:26:07,222 --> 00:26:10,953
Yes. Her white dress, then darkness.

424
00:26:11,126 --> 00:26:15,153
One of the executioners
crashed down with his rifle.

425
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:17,298
Later two brothers were among the guards

426
00:26:17,466 --> 00:26:21,095
That came into the cellar
to remove the dead.

427
00:26:21,269 --> 00:26:22,736
One of the bodies moved.

428
00:26:22,904 --> 00:26:26,635
Hers.
Hidden in a farm cart under straw,

429
00:26:26,808 --> 00:26:30,710
Wrapped in sheets filled
with snow for her fever,

430
00:26:30,879 --> 00:26:33,211
They fled across the country,

431
00:26:33,381 --> 00:26:36,043
Bribed guards with jewels
sewn into her blouse.

432
00:26:36,218 --> 00:26:37,845
Skirt.

433
00:26:38,019 --> 00:26:42,285
Was it?
And they made their way to?

434
00:26:42,457 --> 00:26:43,389
I don't know.

435
00:26:43,558 --> 00:26:45,355
Balta.
Balta.

436
00:26:45,527 --> 00:26:49,395
And from there across
the Romanian border to?

437
00:26:49,564 --> 00:26:52,692
Bucharest.
And there?

438
00:26:52,868 --> 00:26:55,860
There...

439
00:26:57,005 --> 00:27:01,066
There she died of heartbreak
and was thrown into the sea

440
00:27:01,243 --> 00:27:04,337
To the strains of an old Russian waltz.

441
00:27:04,513 --> 00:27:07,004
It was all quite good up to the end.

442
00:27:07,182 --> 00:27:10,583
This icon... you are supposed
to have seen it before.

443
00:27:10,752 --> 00:27:12,219
Remember? Where was it?

444
00:27:12,387 --> 00:27:13,786
In my mother's bedroom.

445
00:27:13,955 --> 00:27:16,651
She was very religious,
and she placed holy pictures everywhere.

446
00:27:16,825 --> 00:27:20,283
Right.
And books and albums just like these,

447
00:27:20,462 --> 00:27:22,430
Scattered about, overflowing the tables,

448
00:27:22,597 --> 00:27:24,565
And there was a sitting room

449
00:27:24,733 --> 00:27:28,134
Between the bedroom
of my mother and my fa...

450
00:27:28,303 --> 00:27:30,294
Oh, no. That was that little
reading room in the hospital.

451
00:27:30,472 --> 00:27:32,997
Oh, how silly.
More coffee? She won't sleep.

452
00:27:33,175 --> 00:27:34,699
She hasn't got time to sleep.

453
00:27:34,876 --> 00:27:38,277
I don't very much anyway, but thank you.

454
00:27:38,446 --> 00:27:40,175
All right, where were we?

455
00:27:40,348 --> 00:27:43,112
Oh, yes. Your mother.

456
00:27:43,285 --> 00:27:44,582
But I know what I am talking about.

457
00:27:44,753 --> 00:27:46,345
We have exactly three days left.

458
00:27:46,521 --> 00:27:48,386
Let us worry about one thing at a time.

459
00:27:48,557 --> 00:27:50,718
"One thing at a time."

460
00:27:50,892 --> 00:27:52,189
All right, Petrovanch, I'll take over.

461
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:55,386
I think she's very tired.
I've had my coffee.

462
00:27:55,564 --> 00:27:58,032
Besides, it all helps to
bring my memory back,

463
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,964
And maybe one memory
will convince someone,

464
00:28:01,136 --> 00:28:03,604
Even if it's only me.

465
00:28:03,772 --> 00:28:05,296
Where did you live in the winter?

466
00:28:05,473 --> 00:28:07,407
The winter palace, St. Petersburg.

467
00:28:07,576 --> 00:28:09,669
Right. Spring?

468
00:28:09,845 --> 00:28:10,709
Spring?

469
00:28:10,879 --> 00:28:13,313
I don't remember.
Tsarskoe Selo.

470
00:28:13,481 --> 00:28:16,450
Tsarskoe Selo.
Summer?

471
00:28:16,618 --> 00:28:19,212
Peterhof, Livadia...

472
00:28:19,387 --> 00:28:21,878
Preferred for the sea air.
Hunting season?

473
00:28:22,057 --> 00:28:23,149
Spala.

474
00:28:23,325 --> 00:28:25,816
Where?
In Poland.

475
00:28:25,994 --> 00:28:27,222
Petrovanch.

476
00:28:27,395 --> 00:28:29,260
And on the Baltic?

477
00:28:29,431 --> 00:28:31,399
No luck, general. The committee...

478
00:28:31,566 --> 00:28:32,931
In Moscow, you stayed...

479
00:28:33,101 --> 00:28:34,568
At the Kremlin.

480
00:28:34,736 --> 00:28:35,964
Sergei Pavlovich, no.

481
00:28:36,137 --> 00:28:38,970
The committee will not
give us even one more day.

482
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:41,938
You think she's ready?
No. Of course, she thinks she is.

483
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:44,738
Listen, she thinks she's Anastasia,

484
00:28:44,913 --> 00:28:46,744
And the great Stanislaviski once said,

485
00:28:46,915 --> 00:28:48,610
"When an actor believes he is

486
00:28:48,783 --> 00:28:50,978
The character he's playing, fire him."
It's a bit late for that.

487
00:28:51,152 --> 00:28:52,551
Well, it's a bit late for anything.

488
00:28:52,721 --> 00:28:55,417
The eight days are finished.
The play is finished.

489
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:56,750
We are finished.

490
00:28:56,925 --> 00:28:58,916
The play is merely
replaced by a pantomime.

491
00:28:59,094 --> 00:29:02,586
Our leading lady will be very weak,
exhausted, too sick to talk.

492
00:29:02,764 --> 00:29:04,823
With careful staging,
the committee will be satisfied.

493
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,365
And careful casting.

494
00:29:06,534 --> 00:29:08,900
Her Imperial Highness
will be too weak to see

495
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:11,538
Any more than, let us say, six members.

496
00:29:11,706 --> 00:29:12,468
Why six?

497
00:29:12,641 --> 00:29:15,439
Three stupid enough
to accept even you as Anastasia.

498
00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:20,479
Three important enough to spread
the news that she is Anastasia.

499
00:29:20,649 --> 00:29:23,516
Your Highness, may I present
a few members of our colony here,

500
00:29:23,685 --> 00:29:26,848
Who, as I told you, are anxious
to see you for just a moment.

501
00:29:27,022 --> 00:29:30,116
His Excellency
Count Ilia Feodorovich Bikhmetev

502
00:29:30,292 --> 00:29:33,750
And his brother,
Count Andrei Feodorovich Bikhmetev,

503
00:29:33,929 --> 00:29:37,490
His Excellency Count Assessor Shushken.

504
00:29:37,666 --> 00:29:41,500
Shushken.
What?

505
00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:43,968
Your Imperial Highness.

506
00:29:44,139 --> 00:29:50,135
His Excellency Von Bridnetz.

507
00:29:53,315 --> 00:29:55,374
It's very rude to stare.

508
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:57,643
Forgive me.

509
00:29:57,819 --> 00:29:59,184
Difficult to say.

510
00:29:59,354 --> 00:30:03,347
Madame Deresianskaia.

511
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:06,459
Come closer.

512
00:30:06,628 --> 00:30:10,621
No. You, please.

513
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,392
I think I know you.

514
00:30:13,568 --> 00:30:15,832
Were you not a lady-in-waiting
To my mother?

515
00:30:16,004 --> 00:30:18,700
Many people know that, I'm afraid.

516
00:30:18,873 --> 00:30:21,239
I'm trying to remember more.

517
00:30:21,409 --> 00:30:22,706
When I was a child, I used to watch

518
00:30:22,877 --> 00:30:24,811
The faces of the ladies- In-waiting

519
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:26,470
To see if they were wearing lip rouge.

520
00:30:26,648 --> 00:30:29,708
My mother did not allow make-up, so I...

521
00:30:29,884 --> 00:30:37,381
I was not mean, just mischievous
I used to report to her.

522
00:30:39,594 --> 00:30:42,119
What was it my mother used to call you?

523
00:30:42,297 --> 00:30:46,290
Sura, um... Zena...

524
00:30:47,002 --> 00:30:50,597
I'm sorry. It escapes my...

525
00:30:50,772 --> 00:30:52,239
Nini.

526
00:30:52,407 --> 00:30:54,204
Yes, Nini.

527
00:30:54,376 --> 00:31:00,372
Your Highness. Your Imperial Highness.

528
00:31:09,891 --> 00:31:10,687
What's the matter?

529
00:31:10,859 --> 00:31:12,292
Don't you like my borscht?

530
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:13,154
No.

531
00:31:13,328 --> 00:31:15,956
Too bad.
The general says you have to eat it.

532
00:31:16,131 --> 00:31:19,032
She won't eat!
All right, go.

533
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,064
This entire household,

534
00:31:20,235 --> 00:31:22,362
Everything has been turned
upside down just for you,

535
00:31:22,537 --> 00:31:24,129
To make you comfortable,
to help you get well.

536
00:31:24,305 --> 00:31:25,101
I don't like borscht.

537
00:31:25,273 --> 00:31:27,673
I don't care whether
you like it or not! Eat it!

538
00:31:27,842 --> 00:31:29,935
I specifically warned you
not to say one word to that committee.

539
00:31:30,111 --> 00:31:31,976
You could have ruined everything.

540
00:31:32,147 --> 00:31:33,546
I told you about Nini, didn't I?

541
00:31:33,715 --> 00:31:35,148
Maybe. I don't know.

542
00:31:35,316 --> 00:31:37,250
Yes, I did or Petrovin did
or you overheard us,

543
00:31:37,419 --> 00:31:38,181
But the important thing...

544
00:31:38,353 --> 00:31:40,981
Are you angry because you're
beginning to wonder who I am

545
00:31:41,156 --> 00:31:43,454
Or because you want me to do nothing
except what you tell me?

546
00:31:43,625 --> 00:31:45,058
I know who you are not,

547
00:31:45,226 --> 00:31:46,716
Just as I know that
unless you do as I tell you,

548
00:31:46,895 --> 00:31:49,159
I'll have an extra cigarette girl
at my club.

549
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:51,457
We now have a breathing spell
we need badly.

550
00:31:51,633 --> 00:31:52,395
You still have a great deal to learn

551
00:31:52,567 --> 00:31:53,693
If you are to achieve
what we have agreed.

552
00:31:53,868 --> 00:31:55,563
Do you understand?

553
00:31:55,737 --> 00:31:57,762
Yes, I understand, Excellency.

554
00:31:57,939 --> 00:31:59,270
Then finish your dinner and get to bed.

555
00:31:59,441 --> 00:32:03,241
Work begins again in the morning.

556
00:32:03,411 --> 00:32:05,242
And now, royal etiquette.

557
00:32:05,413 --> 00:32:09,907
All right...
1, 1, 2, 3, 4.

558
00:32:11,152 --> 00:32:12,779
A queen.

559
00:32:12,954 --> 00:32:15,980
Your Majesty.
A prince of royal blood.

560
00:32:16,157 --> 00:32:17,852
Your Highness.
A prince of ordinary station

561
00:32:18,026 --> 00:32:19,220
Outside of the royal family.

562
00:32:19,394 --> 00:32:21,988
Prince, I suppose, or your Excellency.

563
00:32:22,163 --> 00:32:23,130
This is absurd!

564
00:32:23,298 --> 00:32:25,766
Even Anna Corev wouldn't know all of it!
Pick up the book.

565
00:32:25,934 --> 00:32:28,994
But why do I need it?
Pick up the book.

566
00:32:29,170 --> 00:32:31,536
Put it on your head and walk over there.

567
00:32:31,706 --> 00:32:33,333
You don't seem to realize
that the gesture,

568
00:32:33,508 --> 00:32:35,271
The grace, the carriage
of a true daughter of a tsar...

569
00:32:35,443 --> 00:32:36,774
Cannot be taught.

570
00:32:36,945 --> 00:32:39,505
Either she learns
as a child how to hold herself,

571
00:32:39,681 --> 00:32:45,677
Or it's too late, Excellency.

572
00:32:48,123 --> 00:32:50,057
Did she like to play as a child?

573
00:32:50,225 --> 00:32:52,659
No, but your mother wanted you to.

574
00:32:52,827 --> 00:32:54,988
I still don't like it.

575
00:32:55,163 --> 00:32:57,256
My hands don't have
the strength anymore.

576
00:32:57,432 --> 00:32:59,457
All right. We can use that
as an explanation,

577
00:32:59,634 --> 00:33:03,798
But listen to this.
Now, this is important.

578
00:33:03,972 --> 00:33:05,166
Your tutor wanted you to learn this

579
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:08,036
To prove to your mother

580
00:33:08,209 --> 00:33:12,509
That the lessons were not in vain.

581
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,705
Did I ever learn it?

582
00:33:14,883 --> 00:33:18,876
Yes, but you hated it.

583
00:33:33,168 --> 00:33:35,568
I like it now.

584
00:33:35,737 --> 00:33:39,730
It's quite pretty.

585
00:34:01,429 --> 00:34:04,262
Now around.
That's it.

586
00:34:04,432 --> 00:34:07,424
Once more.

587
00:34:09,337 --> 00:34:11,635
All right. Now the polonaise.
Can't I rest?

588
00:34:11,806 --> 00:34:13,569
Yes. After dinner. Here we go.

589
00:34:13,741 --> 00:34:16,835
I can't.
You will. Head up. Back straight.

590
00:34:17,011 --> 00:34:19,138
1, 2, 3.

591
00:34:19,314 --> 00:34:23,683
1, 2, 3.
1, 2, 3.

592
00:34:23,851 --> 00:34:26,513
Please.
Please concentrate.

593
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:28,588
And 1, 2, 3.

594
00:34:28,756 --> 00:34:31,247
1, 2, 3.
My feet hurt. I can't anymore.

595
00:34:31,426 --> 00:34:33,121
A little rest, perhaps...
There is no time.

596
00:34:33,294 --> 00:34:34,625
New waltz, Petrovanch. Come on.

597
00:34:34,796 --> 00:34:36,593
I'm sure you won't mind doing this.

598
00:34:36,764 --> 00:34:38,288
This is the waltz you like so much.

599
00:34:38,466 --> 00:34:43,961
The back. The back.
With ease, with style.

600
00:34:48,543 --> 00:34:50,602
Didn't you say the other day
it reminded you of something?

601
00:34:50,778 --> 00:34:53,042
Yes. Of my first ball.

602
00:34:53,214 --> 00:34:54,772
And your first love, no doubt.

603
00:34:54,949 --> 00:34:57,440
Yes.

604
00:34:57,619 --> 00:35:02,113
Who was he?
I can't remember.

605
00:35:02,624 --> 00:35:06,424
Was he fair,
Or was he dark with a moustache?

606
00:35:06,594 --> 00:35:08,255
I don't know.

607
00:35:08,429 --> 00:35:11,125
One day he's fair, the next he's dark.

608
00:35:11,299 --> 00:35:14,291
I don't know.

609
00:35:20,642 --> 00:35:26,137
1, 2, 3. 1, 2, 3.
1, 2, 3. 1, 2, 3.

610
00:35:57,478 --> 00:36:00,470
Aah!

611
00:36:21,302 --> 00:36:22,360
What are you doing here?

612
00:36:22,537 --> 00:36:24,164
I can't anymore.

613
00:36:24,339 --> 00:36:26,603
I don't know who I am anymore!

614
00:36:26,774 --> 00:36:29,743
I don't know what I remember
or what I've been told I remember!

615
00:36:29,911 --> 00:36:31,879
What is real? Am I?

616
00:36:32,046 --> 00:36:33,877
Anna.
Anna. Am I Anna?

617
00:36:34,048 --> 00:36:37,142
Why not Tamara? Why not Liza?
Why not Tatiana?

618
00:36:37,318 --> 00:36:39,081
Yes. Why not Tatiana?

619
00:36:39,253 --> 00:36:40,982
Oh, I can't anymore.
I don't want this.

620
00:36:41,155 --> 00:36:43,248
I want to be me, whoever I am.
I want to be me.

621
00:36:43,424 --> 00:36:45,517
I want someone to tell me,
someone to accept me.

622
00:36:45,693 --> 00:36:47,752
Look, you have been working very hard,
and you are overtired,

623
00:36:47,929 --> 00:36:49,089
But we're almost finished now.

624
00:36:49,263 --> 00:36:51,163
Are you? Oh, then you know who I am.

625
00:36:51,332 --> 00:36:53,425
A good night's sleep...
You must know! You must!

626
00:36:53,601 --> 00:36:56,365
Just go to bed.
No! I'm leaving! I'm leaving!

627
00:36:56,537 --> 00:36:59,529
Stop it!

628
00:36:59,707 --> 00:37:03,700
Go to bed at once!

629
00:37:14,489 --> 00:37:17,583
My father was very strict.

630
00:37:17,759 --> 00:37:24,255
I did not like to obey,
but he was ringmaster in the circus.

631
00:37:26,501 --> 00:37:28,332
General Boynin.

632
00:37:28,503 --> 00:37:30,232
Yes?

633
00:37:30,405 --> 00:37:33,397
Who am I?

634
00:37:34,308 --> 00:37:37,072
I don't know.

635
00:37:37,245 --> 00:37:39,770
Their Excellencies
Countess Uradif and daughter

636
00:37:39,947 --> 00:37:41,175
And Prince Tergancev.

637
00:37:41,349 --> 00:37:45,115
My dear Madame, her Highness
and the general will be here shortly.

638
00:37:45,286 --> 00:37:48,312
May I thank you again for all of us
for what you're doing.

639
00:37:48,489 --> 00:37:49,456
I should not be thanked.

640
00:37:49,624 --> 00:37:51,683
It makes me happy to do anything

641
00:37:51,859 --> 00:37:52,325
That will help restore
what is rightfully...

642
00:37:52,493 --> 00:37:54,825
Yes.
Oh, Excellency.

643
00:37:54,996 --> 00:37:56,725
His Excellency General Cavelefsky.

644
00:37:56,898 --> 00:38:00,026
I cannot tell you how important
your presence is here today.

645
00:38:00,201 --> 00:38:02,635
My dear Vivina,
I promised your late father

646
00:38:02,804 --> 00:38:06,706
I'd keep an eye on you.
On occasion, it's a little trying.

647
00:38:06,874 --> 00:38:07,898
I promise you will not regret coming.

648
00:38:08,075 --> 00:38:11,306
That's a promise you may have
some difficulty in keeping.

649
00:38:11,479 --> 00:38:13,913
May I sit down?
Do, please.

650
00:38:14,081 --> 00:38:16,015
This abominable gout.

651
00:38:16,184 --> 00:38:17,048
This way.

652
00:38:17,218 --> 00:38:20,881
Albert, a chair for his Excellency.

653
00:38:21,055 --> 00:38:22,488
Take care of his Excellency.

654
00:38:22,657 --> 00:38:25,785
You know how he is.
Baron and baroness Ryobi.

655
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,393
The old fox himself.

656
00:38:27,562 --> 00:38:31,999
I never thought he would come.
Well, we may wish he hadn't.

657
00:38:32,166 --> 00:38:34,225
How many are you taking?

658
00:38:34,402 --> 00:38:35,596
People will think you're hungry.

659
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:37,237
Hungry? Well, I'm not hungry.

660
00:38:37,405 --> 00:38:39,498
I'm nervous. No, thank you.

661
00:38:39,674 --> 00:38:41,574
His Excellency Count Razumov.

662
00:38:41,742 --> 00:38:45,769
Xenia!
Misha!

663
00:38:45,947 --> 00:38:48,438
I must say, a truly wonderful occasion.

664
00:38:48,616 --> 00:38:50,049
Yes.
What?

665
00:38:50,218 --> 00:38:51,515
Red caviar.
You mean...

666
00:38:51,686 --> 00:38:53,278
Yes.
If the caviar were real...

667
00:38:53,454 --> 00:38:57,891
She would be real.
Your Excellency, remain here, please.

668
00:38:58,059 --> 00:38:59,959
Remain here, your Excellency.

669
00:39:00,127 --> 00:39:02,755
Remain here!
We will see that they come to you.

670
00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:05,091
I understand.
So many old faces.

671
00:39:05,266 --> 00:39:07,496
Yes. And it is their dear
old names we want...

672
00:39:07,668 --> 00:39:10,660
Huh?
We want their names on signed statements

673
00:39:10,838 --> 00:39:12,305
That will convince the bank...

674
00:39:12,473 --> 00:39:13,303
Yes.

675
00:39:13,474 --> 00:39:16,307
Her Imperial Highness,
the Grand Duchess Anastasia.

676
00:39:16,477 --> 00:39:18,138
This way, your Highness.

677
00:39:18,312 --> 00:39:19,574
Francois, the Alcove.

678
00:39:19,747 --> 00:39:22,443
My dear general,
this is all so exciting.

679
00:39:22,617 --> 00:39:25,381
Your Imperial Highness, please.

680
00:39:25,553 --> 00:39:27,077
Well, Petrovanch.

681
00:39:27,255 --> 00:39:30,747
Here we go.
Ladies and gentlemen,

682
00:39:30,925 --> 00:39:33,223
Dear friends,

683
00:39:33,394 --> 00:39:34,383
Oh, I would like to say a few words...

684
00:39:34,562 --> 00:39:36,189
Too much. She's doing too much.

685
00:39:36,364 --> 00:39:39,026
It's very difficult for me to speak today.

686
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,668
General Boynin, would you please?

687
00:39:41,836 --> 00:39:43,064
As you all know, I am the last one

688
00:39:43,237 --> 00:39:44,966
To believe in miracles or resurrections.

689
00:39:45,139 --> 00:39:47,334
But reality cannot be
established without help,

690
00:39:47,508 --> 00:39:50,671
Legal help... witnessed
and signed statements.

691
00:39:50,845 --> 00:39:53,473
It is, frankly, our hope, our need,

692
00:39:53,648 --> 00:39:54,706
That those among you who believe

693
00:39:54,882 --> 00:39:56,213
Will come forward after the reception

694
00:39:56,384 --> 00:40:00,013
And sign these testimonials voluntarily.

695
00:40:00,187 --> 00:40:05,716
Now, I'm quite sure that some of you
have come here to obstruct.

696
00:40:05,893 --> 00:40:09,488
The reasons... political, monetary,
we all know.

697
00:40:09,664 --> 00:40:11,529
There are some who have been made

698
00:40:11,699 --> 00:40:14,031
Understandably cynical
by the revolution,

699
00:40:14,201 --> 00:40:15,634
And there are some

700
00:40:15,803 --> 00:40:19,466
Who will testify to anyone
and anything... and have.

701
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:21,870
To none of you do we bring any pressure.

702
00:40:22,043 --> 00:40:23,408
To all of you, we bring someone

703
00:40:23,578 --> 00:40:27,537
Who has literally suffered wors
than death for 1o lost years.

704
00:40:27,715 --> 00:40:29,945
It is our duty to restore
this extraordinary person

705
00:40:30,117 --> 00:40:31,675
To the world of the living.

706
00:40:31,852 --> 00:40:35,379
If you are sentimental, say it is
because she has suffered enough.

707
00:40:35,556 --> 00:40:37,956
If you are humane,
say justice must be done.

708
00:40:38,125 --> 00:40:41,561
If you are Russian,
a loyal subject of his late Majesty,

709
00:40:41,729 --> 00:40:45,597
Then say with me,
"our only hope is his daughter,

710
00:40:45,766 --> 00:40:49,429
Her Imperial Highness,
Anastasia Nikolayevna."

711
00:40:49,604 --> 00:40:52,072
Her Excellency Countess Voronova.

712
00:40:52,239 --> 00:40:56,573
Your Highness, when Irina...
when Madame Deresianskaia told me,

713
00:40:56,744 --> 00:40:58,712
I confess I really had doubts.

714
00:40:58,879 --> 00:41:00,141
You can understand.

715
00:41:00,314 --> 00:41:02,805
It really is a miracle.
Is it?

716
00:41:02,984 --> 00:41:04,008
Yes, your Highness.

717
00:41:04,185 --> 00:41:05,209
We met only once...

718
00:41:05,386 --> 00:41:07,581
I remember.
Near the tennis courts at Livaldia.

719
00:41:07,755 --> 00:41:10,622
Yes.
I also remember that my uncle Alex

720
00:41:10,791 --> 00:41:12,725
Got you the title
because he liked dancing.

721
00:41:12,893 --> 00:41:14,224
But from then on,
you made a fool of him.

722
00:41:14,395 --> 00:41:16,522
My mother never liked you,
My father never liked you,

723
00:41:16,697 --> 00:41:18,324
And I never liked you. Please go.

724
00:41:18,499 --> 00:41:20,967
Now, just a moment.
You're not Anastasia yet,

725
00:41:21,135 --> 00:41:26,072
And if I have...
I said please go!

726
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,299
You are mad.
Don't answer.

727
00:41:28,476 --> 00:41:30,944
But I warn you for the last time.

728
00:41:31,112 --> 00:41:33,979
Your Excellency, you're not leaving
without seeing her Highness.

729
00:41:34,148 --> 00:41:35,137
I have seen her.

730
00:41:35,316 --> 00:41:38,479
Oh, but she will be so disappointed
at not having seen you again.

731
00:41:38,653 --> 00:41:41,679
And how do you know that?
Huh? You mean how do I...

732
00:41:41,856 --> 00:41:44,450
Truthfully, Excellency, we don't,
but we're sure she will.

733
00:41:44,625 --> 00:41:45,649
We're sure, Excellency.

734
00:41:45,826 --> 00:41:48,420
And I. Dear Ivan Vaselevich,
you stayed this long,

735
00:41:48,596 --> 00:41:50,086
And after all, you did promise me...

736
00:41:50,264 --> 00:41:52,824
Now, don't wheedle, Irina.
Oh, all right.

737
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,490
But don't try to keep me there too long.

738
00:41:54,669 --> 00:41:57,661
My foot hurts.

739
00:41:58,139 --> 00:42:02,906
I think you are due for a surprise.

740
00:42:03,077 --> 00:42:06,342
His Excellency...
I'm so glad to see you, Ivan Vaselevich.

741
00:42:06,514 --> 00:42:08,448
They told you my name. How kind.

742
00:42:08,616 --> 00:42:09,742
Won't you sit down?

743
00:42:09,917 --> 00:42:12,545
No, thank you. I don't expect to stay.

744
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:15,450
My father's chamberlain
was a man of great courtesy.

745
00:42:15,623 --> 00:42:18,353
His Majesty complimented me
on many things.

746
00:42:18,526 --> 00:42:20,926
I don't recall his mentioning courtesy.

747
00:42:21,095 --> 00:42:23,222
My father's chamberlain
was also a temperate man

748
00:42:23,397 --> 00:42:24,625
Who did not judge before...

749
00:42:24,799 --> 00:42:27,131
Madame, forgive me.
I've a miserable attack of gout

750
00:42:27,301 --> 00:42:29,895
Undoubtedly a punishment
for being intemperate,

751
00:42:30,071 --> 00:42:33,040
And I'm eager to return to
my tub of hot water.

752
00:42:33,207 --> 00:42:35,505
There are many characteristics
which you could recall,

753
00:42:35,676 --> 00:42:38,804
Many details,
but so could dozens of others.

754
00:42:38,979 --> 00:42:42,813
My relations with His Majesty's
children were impersonal, public.

755
00:42:42,983 --> 00:42:43,608
So in the end,

756
00:42:43,784 --> 00:42:45,649
My judgment can only be
a matter of opinion,

757
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:49,517
And that opinion can only be determined
by resemblance and manner.

758
00:42:49,690 --> 00:42:52,056
Your Excellency,
1o years is a long time.

759
00:42:52,226 --> 00:42:54,456
No. I've already noted the resemblance.

760
00:42:54,628 --> 00:42:57,825
As for the manner, I've been watching,

761
00:42:57,998 --> 00:42:59,795
And you give me pleasure.

762
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:01,730
You've taken me back to my seat

763
00:43:01,902 --> 00:43:04,427
In the imperial theater
at St. Petersburg.

764
00:43:04,605 --> 00:43:07,506
Second row on the aisle
every Tuesday night.

765
00:43:07,675 --> 00:43:11,133
For the purpose of acting
is not only to imitate reality,

766
00:43:11,312 --> 00:43:13,405
But to create illusion.

767
00:43:13,581 --> 00:43:15,913
I'm not being sarcastic
when I say that you are

768
00:43:16,083 --> 00:43:20,213
An excellent actress, Madame...
extremely well-trained.

769
00:43:20,387 --> 00:43:22,821
My compliments.
I do not accept them.

770
00:43:22,990 --> 00:43:24,753
Madame, my foot is troubling me.

771
00:43:24,925 --> 00:43:27,689
My life is troubling me,
and it has yet to be lived.

772
00:43:27,862 --> 00:43:30,854
You do not believe
because you do not wish to believe.

773
00:43:31,031 --> 00:43:32,498
You say my words will not convince

774
00:43:32,666 --> 00:43:34,998
Because you're afraid
I know the right words.

775
00:43:35,169 --> 00:43:36,261
You misquote, Madame.

776
00:43:36,437 --> 00:43:39,668
I also said that the manner,
the deportment of a grand duchess

777
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:43,901
Would convince me,
but I don't see it in you,

778
00:43:44,078 --> 00:43:45,306
Not a gesture,

779
00:43:45,479 --> 00:43:47,845
Though one would be worth
more than all the words

780
00:43:48,015 --> 00:43:49,812
You undoubtedly can produce.

781
00:43:49,984 --> 00:43:52,452
Good day, Madame.

782
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:59,025
How dare you smoke in my presence
without my permission?

783
00:43:59,193 --> 00:44:01,923
Who are you?

784
00:44:02,096 --> 00:44:08,092
15, 16, 17, 18 out of a possible 51.

785
00:44:09,837 --> 00:44:12,135
And you were so sure
it would be almost a clean sweep.

786
00:44:12,306 --> 00:44:14,866
Didn't the old fox himself
say her performance was great art?

787
00:44:15,042 --> 00:44:17,408
We're not doing this for art.
We're doing it for money.

788
00:44:17,578 --> 00:44:19,341
Now, listen, this can go on forever...

789
00:44:19,513 --> 00:44:21,447
Some saying she is,
some saying she isn't.

790
00:44:21,615 --> 00:44:23,276
Precisely. My mind is made up.

791
00:44:23,450 --> 00:44:25,850
Oh, to what?
There's only one way...

792
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:26,987
To go straight to the top.

793
00:44:27,154 --> 00:44:30,248
You mean the old icon?
Yes. The dowager empress.

794
00:44:30,424 --> 00:44:31,948
Oh, sure. The old ramrod

795
00:44:32,126 --> 00:44:34,959
Sitting in her castle
in Copenhagen biting her nails

796
00:44:35,129 --> 00:44:37,689
Because she's waiting for
Sarah Bernhardt here

797
00:44:37,865 --> 00:44:39,799
To give her performance.

798
00:44:39,967 --> 00:44:41,059
She's the one chance.

799
00:44:41,235 --> 00:44:43,169
As head of the family,
no one would dare dispute her word.

800
00:44:43,337 --> 00:44:45,362
Dispute her word.

801
00:44:45,539 --> 00:44:47,803
Excellency,
Her Highness would like to see you.

802
00:44:47,975 --> 00:44:49,408
Her what?
Isn't she?

803
00:44:49,577 --> 00:44:52,774
She can wait.
Not too long. She's packing up.

804
00:44:52,947 --> 00:44:55,939
Packing up?

805
00:44:57,218 --> 00:44:58,685
And where's Her Highness going?

806
00:44:58,853 --> 00:45:00,320
I don't know, and it doesn't matter.

807
00:45:00,487 --> 00:45:03,718
So, did you enjoy yourself today?
Yes. Until I became ashamed,

808
00:45:03,891 --> 00:45:06,052
Ashamed of allowing myself
to be put on display,

809
00:45:06,227 --> 00:45:08,422
Ashamed of conjuring up
tricks like a circus freak,

810
00:45:08,596 --> 00:45:11,190
Ashamed of asking people
to sign papers that I am real!

811
00:45:11,365 --> 00:45:12,525
I am real!

812
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:14,429
And I will not stoop
to prove it to them!

813
00:45:14,602 --> 00:45:16,536
Who are they?
Who are you?

814
00:45:16,704 --> 00:45:19,332
I think I know.
Today? And tomorrow?

815
00:45:19,506 --> 00:45:21,337
Will you be so sure tomorrow
and the day after?

816
00:45:21,508 --> 00:45:23,738
Why? Why can't you let me believe?

817
00:45:23,911 --> 00:45:25,378
I will even help you believe

818
00:45:25,546 --> 00:45:26,706
When I am sure of the truth myself.

819
00:45:26,881 --> 00:45:28,746
No one will ever be sure,
and you least of all.

820
00:45:28,916 --> 00:45:30,440
I know that today, too.
Wrong.

821
00:45:30,618 --> 00:45:32,210
Those people today
were not worth your efforts,

822
00:45:32,386 --> 00:45:33,444
But there is someone who is.

823
00:45:33,621 --> 00:45:35,816
One word from her,
and they will all grovel.

824
00:45:35,990 --> 00:45:37,958
The dowager empress, maria feodorovna.

825
00:45:38,125 --> 00:45:40,218
Grandmama.
Grandmama.

826
00:45:40,394 --> 00:45:43,192
Grandmama.

827
00:45:43,364 --> 00:45:44,956
She'll never see me.
She will.

828
00:45:45,132 --> 00:45:46,258
How do you know?
I know she will.

829
00:45:46,433 --> 00:45:47,229
Words.

830
00:45:47,401 --> 00:45:49,528
Call me Schemer, Plotter.
Call me what you will,

831
00:45:49,703 --> 00:45:51,295
But deep down, you know that if anyone

832
00:45:51,472 --> 00:45:53,565
Can get you to see that old woman,
it is I.

833
00:45:53,741 --> 00:45:55,971
I'll get you there for your sake.

834
00:45:56,143 --> 00:45:57,303
For my sake?

835
00:45:57,478 --> 00:46:00,845
You never did anything
for the sake of anybody but yourself.

836
00:46:01,015 --> 00:46:03,848
You enjoy playing with people,
making fools of them!

837
00:46:04,018 --> 00:46:05,576
That's why you're doing it... as a joke!

838
00:46:05,753 --> 00:46:07,277
To prove that you are great and alive

839
00:46:07,454 --> 00:46:09,684
And the others are small and dead!
Yes, and for money!

840
00:46:09,857 --> 00:46:14,851
Go ahead. It won't hurt.

841
00:46:15,963 --> 00:46:18,955
Sit down.

842
00:46:22,636 --> 00:46:27,335
If you want to leave after I am through,
I won't force you to stay.

843
00:46:27,508 --> 00:46:29,373
Let us say you are right.

844
00:46:29,543 --> 00:46:31,738
As a matter of fact, you are.

845
00:46:31,912 --> 00:46:33,675
But that's all the more reason
for you to go with me

846
00:46:33,847 --> 00:46:36,145
To the empress in Copenhagen.

847
00:46:36,317 --> 00:46:38,842
Never trust anyone who functions
from noble motives.

848
00:46:39,019 --> 00:46:40,247
The good are never sure,

849
00:46:40,421 --> 00:46:41,888
And in the end, they'll let you down.

850
00:46:42,056 --> 00:46:44,354
Our motives are different, agreed.

851
00:46:44,525 --> 00:46:50,828
But our goal is the same,
And that's the only thing that counts.

852
00:46:50,998 --> 00:46:56,994
Well, we'll go to Copenhagen?

853
00:46:58,072 --> 00:46:59,869
I had a dream the other night.

854
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:03,771
Yes. About your father
being a ringmaster.

855
00:47:03,944 --> 00:47:07,004
No. This time he was a dollmaker.

856
00:47:07,181 --> 00:47:10,810
My mother, his assistant
Who painted the faces.

857
00:47:10,985 --> 00:47:14,978
A correct ancestry for a puppet.

858
00:47:15,155 --> 00:47:22,721
You know I'll go.
You always know.

859
00:47:43,684 --> 00:47:45,811
She always wore black...
the empress... didn't she?

860
00:47:45,986 --> 00:47:47,920
Yes.

861
00:47:48,088 --> 00:47:50,352
For 10 years, I've wanted to see her.

862
00:47:50,524 --> 00:47:52,321
She was never very easy
even before the end.

863
00:47:52,493 --> 00:47:54,518
Yes, I know.

864
00:47:54,695 --> 00:47:56,526
You know or you remember?

865
00:47:56,697 --> 00:47:59,291
"Prince Paul." let's see...

866
00:47:59,466 --> 00:48:01,957
Nephew to the empress,
second cousin to me,

867
00:48:02,136 --> 00:48:04,661
Engaged to me when I was... how old?

868
00:48:04,838 --> 00:48:07,204
16.

869
00:48:07,374 --> 00:48:09,342
Quite attractive.

870
00:48:09,510 --> 00:48:11,068
Do you remember him?
No.

871
00:48:11,245 --> 00:48:13,475
Well, you should.
I'll tell you a secret.

872
00:48:13,647 --> 00:48:15,547
That first waltz you always remember...

873
00:48:15,716 --> 00:48:18,617
It was with him.

874
00:48:18,786 --> 00:48:20,720
Danish customs.
Have you anything to declare?

875
00:48:20,888 --> 00:48:23,379
No.
Madame? Thank you.

876
00:48:23,557 --> 00:48:25,081
Madame Anderson.

877
00:48:25,259 --> 00:48:27,727
Madame Anderson!
Oh, yes!

878
00:48:27,895 --> 00:48:29,556
Boynin. Everything in order?

879
00:48:29,730 --> 00:48:30,924
Yes. It seems to be.

880
00:48:31,098 --> 00:48:33,157
Welcome to Denmark.
I hope you enjoy your visit.

881
00:48:33,333 --> 00:48:36,325
Thank you.

882
00:48:37,304 --> 00:48:40,273
I'm sorry. I forgot.
I've had so many names.

883
00:48:40,441 --> 00:48:41,806
It was a struggle to get you that one.

884
00:48:41,975 --> 00:48:43,272
Why Aanderson?

885
00:48:43,444 --> 00:48:45,241
Oh, well, you needed some name,

886
00:48:45,412 --> 00:48:46,811
And once, I was in a situation with...

887
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:48,641
With a lady?

888
00:48:48,816 --> 00:48:50,875
Well, as an alias,
it is innocuous enough.

889
00:48:51,051 --> 00:48:53,349
"Madame A. Anderson."

890
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:55,010
The least real thing about me

891
00:48:55,189 --> 00:48:56,451
Is my legal reality.

892
00:48:56,623 --> 00:48:58,318
What happened to
the other Madame Anderson?

893
00:48:58,492 --> 00:48:59,891
Oh, nothing very important.

894
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:02,551
You just got tired of her?

895
00:49:02,729 --> 00:49:05,254
This visa is good for only 14 days.

896
00:49:05,432 --> 00:49:06,592
Two weeks.

897
00:49:06,767 --> 00:49:09,429
Most people have a lifetime
in which to be accepted.

898
00:49:09,603 --> 00:49:10,934
Suppose two weeks are not enough?

899
00:49:11,105 --> 00:49:14,097
They must be.

900
00:49:58,719 --> 00:49:59,651
What's that for?

901
00:49:59,820 --> 00:50:02,914
In the Calvary, we used to do it
The infantry marchin

902
00:50:03,090 --> 00:50:05,490
Driver...
What is this parade?

903
00:50:05,659 --> 00:50:06,387
Nothing special.

904
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:08,755
We have it every day
the king is here in Copenhagen.

905
00:50:08,929 --> 00:50:11,659
Thank you.
The king?

906
00:50:11,832 --> 00:50:14,562
Uncle Chris, cousin to grandmama,
the Empress.

907
00:50:14,735 --> 00:50:18,728
Good. Very good.

908
00:50:33,253 --> 00:50:37,246
Excuse me, sir.

909
00:50:38,992 --> 00:50:40,721
Will you see Mrs. Anderson
to her rooms, please?

910
00:50:40,894 --> 00:50:43,158
Yes, sir.
Excuse me, please.

911
00:50:43,330 --> 00:50:48,290
Where is the bar?
That way, sir.

912
00:50:48,468 --> 00:50:50,265
Well?
Not good.

913
00:50:50,437 --> 00:50:51,233
Uh-uh.

914
00:50:51,405 --> 00:50:53,771
The empress absolutely
refuses to see you,

915
00:50:53,941 --> 00:50:56,535
Let alone her.
And him?

916
00:50:56,710 --> 00:50:58,109
No. Uh-uh.

917
00:50:58,278 --> 00:51:01,304
Our Prince Paul lives
on the old lady's allowance.

918
00:51:01,481 --> 00:51:03,039
He was always rather courageous.

919
00:51:03,217 --> 00:51:05,014
One possibility...

920
00:51:05,185 --> 00:51:07,210
Remember Baroness Von Lievenbaum,

921
00:51:07,387 --> 00:51:09,617
That crazy lady-in-waiting
to the empress?

922
00:51:09,790 --> 00:51:11,849
Vaguely.
She remembers you clearly.

923
00:51:12,025 --> 00:51:13,219
Just a moment.

924
00:51:13,393 --> 00:51:15,918
You have a rendezvous
with her tomorrow at 4:oo.

925
00:51:16,096 --> 00:51:20,590
Rendezvous?
Yes, at the Tivoli gardens.

926
00:52:08,615 --> 00:52:10,810
It isn't! It can't be!

927
00:52:10,984 --> 00:52:13,214
It is!
Elena Von Lievenbaum.

928
00:52:13,387 --> 00:52:14,649
Sergei Boynin.

929
00:52:14,821 --> 00:52:17,187
Do sit down.
Thank you.

930
00:52:17,357 --> 00:52:19,917
No. It's too dangerous, but I will.

931
00:52:20,093 --> 00:52:21,185
Dangerous? Come.

932
00:52:21,361 --> 00:52:23,727
Whom could we possibly
run into here at Tivoli except

933
00:52:23,897 --> 00:52:25,762
That's exactly why I chose it.

934
00:52:25,932 --> 00:52:28,457
How fit you look. Superb.

935
00:52:28,635 --> 00:52:31,103
But this is a stiflingly
small town... a village.

936
00:52:31,271 --> 00:52:32,203
A hundred chattering tongues

937
00:52:32,372 --> 00:52:33,839
Will go gossiping to Her Majesty,

938
00:52:34,007 --> 00:52:36,441
"Your lady-in waiting
was seen with that man."

939
00:52:36,610 --> 00:52:37,838
That man, ha.

940
00:52:38,011 --> 00:52:40,172
A flagon of your delicious beer.

941
00:52:40,347 --> 00:52:41,837
I always drink what the natives drink.

942
00:52:42,015 --> 00:52:44,347
Oh, this is madness without the moon.

943
00:52:44,518 --> 00:52:46,452
My dear baroness, you will never change.

944
00:52:46,620 --> 00:52:47,780
Now you are trying to bribe me,

945
00:52:47,954 --> 00:52:50,320
Just as the empress said you would.
Where is she?

946
00:52:50,490 --> 00:52:51,548
The empress?

947
00:52:51,725 --> 00:52:54,193
She's playing solitaire
with her memories.

948
00:52:54,361 --> 00:52:56,226
No, dear general, Anastasia...

949
00:52:56,396 --> 00:52:57,761
Or should I say Her Highness?

950
00:52:57,931 --> 00:52:59,899
Is it really she? I long to meet her!

951
00:53:00,067 --> 00:53:01,125
And so you shall,

952
00:53:01,301 --> 00:53:03,769
As soon as she is properly
introduced to Copenhagen.

953
00:53:03,937 --> 00:53:05,734
What a look you have.

954
00:53:05,906 --> 00:53:08,374
How inevitable that I'm useless to you.

955
00:53:08,542 --> 00:53:09,031
Why?

956
00:53:09,209 --> 00:53:11,268
The empress will never
receive you or that woman.

957
00:53:11,445 --> 00:53:13,538
You know her, an unmeltable icicle.

958
00:53:13,714 --> 00:53:15,443
Thank you.

959
00:53:15,615 --> 00:53:17,845
And you won't get at her
through Paul, either.

960
00:53:18,018 --> 00:53:19,508
He sends her his bills

961
00:53:19,686 --> 00:53:20,152
As though they were invitations.

962
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:21,844
He behaves as though
we were still in Russia.

963
00:53:22,022 --> 00:53:24,923
Russia. I am all of
Chekhov's three sisters

964
00:53:25,092 --> 00:53:27,458
Rolled into one.
I shall never get back there.

965
00:53:27,627 --> 00:53:29,925
Surely you must have a pleasant life
with the empress

966
00:53:30,097 --> 00:53:32,827
With Her Majesty,
life is one eternal glass of milk.

967
00:53:32,999 --> 00:53:35,661
Oh, come. There must be some court life.
Not a crumb.

968
00:53:35,836 --> 00:53:37,030
She never entertains?

969
00:53:37,204 --> 00:53:40,139
Her phantoms,
the ghosts of her dead family.

970
00:53:40,307 --> 00:53:44,243
But she must go out for a drive
or shopping or a muse

971
00:53:44,411 --> 00:53:47,244
If you ever speak, whisper,
breathe one word...

972
00:53:47,414 --> 00:53:49,939
Well, she does go out occasionally,
if there's anythi

973
00:53:50,117 --> 00:53:52,881
An opera or a ballet.
Let me see.

974
00:53:53,053 --> 00:53:54,611
They're performing
a ballet of Tchaikovsky's

975
00:53:54,788 --> 00:53:56,881
This week at the royal theater.

976
00:53:57,057 --> 00:54:01,050
Thursday, I believe.

977
00:54:13,039 --> 00:54:15,269
Come over here for a moment.

978
00:54:15,442 --> 00:54:17,876
I want you to look as beautiful
as possible tonight.

979
00:54:18,044 --> 00:54:18,976
Oh.

980
00:54:19,146 --> 00:54:21,512
He's quite a simple soul,
really... Prince Paul.

981
00:54:21,681 --> 00:54:23,512
His vocation and avocation
are one in the same...

982
00:54:23,683 --> 00:54:25,082
The pursuit of beautiful women.

983
00:54:25,252 --> 00:54:27,117
If you thought it necessary,
I suppose you would even

984
00:54:27,287 --> 00:54:31,280
To a plastic surgeon.

985
00:54:36,563 --> 00:54:37,825
Take your seat.

986
00:54:37,998 --> 00:54:40,091
Do you know how long it is
since I've been to a theat

987
00:54:40,267 --> 00:54:47,764
Don't display too much excitement.
Sit down.

988
00:54:49,042 --> 00:54:50,907
General, they just arrived.

989
00:54:51,077 --> 00:54:55,571
She, too?
Yes.

990
00:55:11,431 --> 00:55:15,925
Program.
Your Majesty.

991
00:55:19,406 --> 00:55:21,135
The box nearest the stage.

992
00:55:21,308 --> 00:55:22,832
The man you want me
to look beautiful for?

993
00:55:23,009 --> 00:55:24,567
Yes.
My fiance?

994
00:55:24,744 --> 00:55:26,803
The lady next to him
is Baroness Von Lievenbaum,

995
00:55:26,980 --> 00:55:29,380
Lady-in-waiting to the empress.

996
00:55:29,549 --> 00:55:30,811
And where's the empress?

997
00:55:30,984 --> 00:55:35,250
In the back of the box,
behind the curtain.

998
00:55:35,422 --> 00:55:41,190
So close after so many years.

999
00:55:41,361 --> 00:55:47,357
Oh, I am suddenly frightened.

1000
00:56:28,708 --> 00:56:31,609
Go with them to the buffet,
and stand facing this way

1001
00:56:31,778 --> 00:56:33,712
Tonight can mean...
I know what tonight can mean.

1002
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:36,872
Go ahead.

1003
00:56:39,819 --> 00:56:42,549
Uh, please, three coffees.

1004
00:56:42,722 --> 00:56:43,654
Have you ever seen her before?

1005
00:56:43,823 --> 00:56:44,721
The one with Boynin?
No.

1006
00:56:44,891 --> 00:56:48,292
Good evening, your Highness.
Good to see you again.

1007
00:56:48,461 --> 00:56:49,894
Thank you. When did you return?

1008
00:56:50,063 --> 00:56:51,155
Where from?

1009
00:56:51,331 --> 00:56:53,060
The hunting trip I was told
you were on all week.

1010
00:56:53,233 --> 00:56:55,463
Oh. My relations with my aunt

1011
00:56:55,635 --> 00:56:56,659
Forces me to be on far too many trips.

1012
00:56:56,836 --> 00:56:57,700
I apologize.

1013
00:56:57,871 --> 00:57:00,066
I understand.
Who's the lovely lady with you?

1014
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:02,003
Mrs. Anderson.
Extremely lovely.

1015
00:57:02,175 --> 00:57:05,144
Yes, she's rather pretty.
Anderson? Is she Danish, En

1016
00:57:05,312 --> 00:57:07,712
Well, she's many things.

1017
00:57:07,881 --> 00:57:13,649
Would you like to meet her?
You know very well I woul

1018
00:57:13,820 --> 00:57:16,789
May I present his Highness
Prince Paul Von Herelburg.

1019
00:57:16,957 --> 00:57:20,654
Her Imperial Highness
Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolay

1020
00:57:20,827 --> 00:57:21,919
I should have known.

1021
00:57:22,095 --> 00:57:23,824
Traveling under the name
of Mrs. Anderson.

1022
00:57:23,997 --> 00:57:26,329
Surprised?

1023
00:57:26,499 --> 00:57:29,161
I wasn't sure I recognized you either.

1024
00:57:29,336 --> 00:57:30,325
But you are sure now?

1025
00:57:30,503 --> 00:57:34,405
Yes. I shall not
ask yet whether you are.

1026
00:57:34,574 --> 00:57:36,565
You're either very kind or very tactful.

1027
00:57:36,743 --> 00:57:38,108
My compliments.

1028
00:57:38,278 --> 00:57:42,271
Will you both excuse me?
You are afraid.

1029
00:57:42,449 --> 00:57:44,041
As a little boy, you always were.

1030
00:57:44,217 --> 00:57:47,084
Is it, after all, such a terrible risk
To have a drin

1031
00:57:47,253 --> 00:57:49,448
It seems that anything
with the general is a risk.

1032
00:57:49,623 --> 00:57:51,591
Even a drink.
Then have it with me.

1033
00:57:51,758 --> 00:57:53,692
Now it is my turn.
Will you both excuse me?

1034
00:57:53,860 --> 00:57:55,623
Of course.

1035
00:57:55,795 --> 00:57:58,491
You have changed.
So have you.

1036
00:57:58,665 --> 00:58:00,326
Then you do remember?

1037
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:01,262
I remember a little girl

1038
00:58:01,434 --> 00:58:03,095
Who used to delight
backing me into a corner.

1039
00:58:03,269 --> 00:58:04,236
I remember a little boy

1040
00:58:04,404 --> 00:58:05,962
Who always took time
to make up his mind.

1041
00:58:06,139 --> 00:58:09,074
For example?
Ah, you're testing me?

1042
00:58:09,242 --> 00:58:12,405
No, prodding you to talk
so I can enjoy looking at yo

1043
00:58:12,579 --> 00:58:17,073
Champagne?
Why not?

1044
00:58:22,822 --> 00:58:28,818
Uh, the Baroness Von Lievenbaum, please.

1045
00:58:29,829 --> 00:58:32,320
General Boynin, Quelle surprise!

1046
00:58:32,499 --> 00:58:35,297
Vasili, Her Majesty would like
a glass of mineral wat

1047
00:58:35,468 --> 00:58:37,459
You are a monster.

1048
00:58:37,637 --> 00:58:38,626
Well, I've survived a revolution.

1049
00:58:38,805 --> 00:58:41,569
I suppose I can survive this.
Will you forgive me if

1050
00:58:41,741 --> 00:58:43,606
That Vasili gets
the right kind of water?

1051
00:58:43,777 --> 00:58:51,274
Her Majesty is madly particular.
Certainly.

1052
00:58:56,156 --> 00:58:58,590
Your Majesty.
Who is it?

1053
00:58:58,758 --> 00:59:00,919
Oh.
Your Majesty, forgive me.

1054
00:59:01,094 --> 00:59:03,426
I did once when I heard you'd been shot.

1055
00:59:03,596 --> 00:59:04,654
I was sentenced twice.

1056
00:59:04,831 --> 00:59:07,299
By whom? The whites or the reds?
As I recall, by both

1057
00:59:07,467 --> 00:59:09,992
Good for them, but you're still here.

1058
00:59:10,170 --> 00:59:12,195
I have asked Your Majesty's pardon.

1059
00:59:12,372 --> 00:59:14,033
For what? For this intrusion?

1060
00:59:14,207 --> 00:59:16,107
For the effrontery of
using the name of Romanov

1061
00:59:16,276 --> 00:59:18,039
To launch a commercial enterprise?

1062
00:59:18,211 --> 00:59:20,543
For hammering at my gate for days?

1063
00:59:20,714 --> 00:59:21,646
Your Majesty...

1064
00:59:21,815 --> 00:59:25,410
Boynin, I have already been
shown two Tatianas,

1065
00:59:25,585 --> 00:59:27,246
An Alexei, and a Maria

1066
00:59:27,420 --> 00:59:29,183
As well as an Anastasia.

1067
00:59:29,355 --> 00:59:31,289
I will not see your client.

1068
00:59:31,458 --> 00:59:33,255
I am as weary of
these spectral grandchildren

1069
00:59:33,426 --> 00:59:35,189
As I am of false hope.

1070
00:59:35,361 --> 00:59:37,022
I have lost everything I have loved...

1071
00:59:37,197 --> 00:59:39,791
My husband, my family,
my position, my country.

1072
00:59:39,966 --> 00:59:43,493
I have nothing but memories.
I want to be left alone

1073
00:59:43,670 --> 00:59:45,262
Perhaps one memory may be a reality.

1074
00:59:45,438 --> 00:59:48,271
The only reality for you
is an investment.

1075
00:59:48,441 --> 00:59:51,376
Your Majesty,
only a fool would bring you#A mere inve

1076
00:59:51,544 --> 00:59:52,636
Whatever you may think of me,

1077
00:59:52,812 --> 00:59:54,541
You must know that I am not a fool.

1078
00:59:54,714 --> 00:59:57,080
I, too, have gone through
the revolution into the wor

1079
00:59:57,250 --> 00:59:59,150
The effects of your journey
are not visible.

1080
00:59:59,319 --> 01:00:02,288
You know perfectly well
this woman is not my granddau

1081
01:00:02,455 --> 01:00:04,616
Quite honestly, I don't know who she is.

1082
01:00:04,791 --> 01:00:07,021
But there is so much
that cannot be explained

1083
01:00:07,193 --> 01:00:09,753
Unless she is the woman
she believes she is.

1084
01:00:09,929 --> 01:00:12,727
I see now that it mattered
more to you than I thought

1085
01:00:12,899 --> 01:00:13,593
I beg your pardon.

1086
01:00:13,767 --> 01:00:15,428
You really wanted
that title you never got.

1087
01:00:15,602 --> 01:00:17,069
You're not doing this simply for money.

1088
01:00:17,237 --> 01:00:19,364
You have never forgiven my family,
have you?

1089
01:00:19,539 --> 01:00:21,336
Your Majesty,
I am here simply to tell you

1090
01:00:21,508 --> 01:00:23,976
That whoever this woman is,
she asks only one thing...

1091
01:00:24,144 --> 01:00:24,940
To see you.

1092
01:00:25,111 --> 01:00:27,079
Unfortunately,
there are not enough years remaining

1093
01:00:27,247 --> 01:00:29,909
For me to see every madwoman
with a royal obsession.

1094
01:00:30,083 --> 01:00:32,643
If she must see me,
show her my photographs again.

1095
01:00:32,819 --> 01:00:33,285
Your Majesty...

1096
01:00:33,453 --> 01:00:39,949
Go back to Paris, Boynin.
You're wasting your time.

1097
01:00:45,298 --> 01:00:49,792
General!
Good evening.

1098
01:00:50,203 --> 01:00:55,197
Your Majesty, I thought perhaps...
Save your nonsense

1099
01:00:55,375 --> 01:00:57,741
So Boynin is still attractive.

1100
01:00:57,911 --> 01:01:00,880
Ha ha! Yes, Your Majesty.
Madly attractive!

1101
01:01:01,047 --> 01:01:02,344
Yes, Your Majesty.

1102
01:01:02,515 --> 01:01:05,211
Lievenbaum, your voluptuous
fancies are disgusting.

1103
01:01:05,385 --> 01:01:08,548
To a woman of your age,
sex should mean nothing but g

1104
01:01:08,721 --> 01:01:12,714
Yes, Your Majesty.

1105
01:01:23,269 --> 01:01:25,260
You saw her?
What did she say? Did she...

1106
01:01:25,438 --> 01:01:28,532
I did not see her. What did he say?

1107
01:01:28,708 --> 01:01:29,800
He was very charming.

1108
01:01:29,976 --> 01:01:30,908
I like him much more

1109
01:01:31,077 --> 01:01:32,874
Than I thought I would
from your description.

1110
01:01:33,046 --> 01:01:35,344
Do you?
Don't you want me to?

1111
01:01:35,515 --> 01:01:41,579
I want you to make him like you
more than he thought

1112
01:01:41,754 --> 01:01:43,585
Forgive me, Aunt Maria.
I just ran into somebody else

1113
01:01:43,756 --> 01:01:46,088
I forgive you.

1114
01:01:46,259 --> 01:01:47,920
You ran into a blonde.

1115
01:01:48,094 --> 01:01:51,325
Very pretty. Is she married?

1116
01:01:51,497 --> 01:01:52,896
Well, who is she?

1117
01:01:53,066 --> 01:01:55,296
I don't know yet.
Go on, you can tell me.

1118
01:01:55,468 --> 01:01:58,130
Lievenbaum,
I came for the other performance.

1119
01:01:58,304 --> 01:02:01,296
Your Majesty.

1120
01:02:39,812 --> 01:02:41,302
The jewels, please.
Jewels?

1121
01:02:41,481 --> 01:02:43,642
Yes, the jewels.

1122
01:02:43,816 --> 01:02:46,341
Would you put these
in the safe downstairs?

1123
01:02:46,519 --> 01:02:47,816
Why? They're fake.

1124
01:02:47,987 --> 01:02:50,046
You know that, but the manager won't.

1125
01:02:50,223 --> 01:02:52,783
Ah! Public relations.

1126
01:02:52,959 --> 01:02:55,393
Anything else?
No. See you in the morning. Good night

1127
01:02:55,561 --> 01:02:58,553
Good night.

1128
01:03:05,038 --> 01:03:07,268
You did very well tonight.

1129
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:09,931
Thank you. Am I dismissed now, too?

1130
01:03:10,109 --> 01:03:12,407
Yes. You had better get some rest.

1131
01:03:12,578 --> 01:03:14,375
Prince Paul will be calling
for you tomorrow evening.

1132
01:03:14,547 --> 01:03:16,276
Thank you for achieving the invitation.

1133
01:03:16,449 --> 01:03:20,215
You achieved it. I merely accepted.

1134
01:03:20,386 --> 01:03:23,480
The empress doesn't want
to see me, does she?

1135
01:03:23,656 --> 01:03:24,850
She will see you.

1136
01:03:25,024 --> 01:03:26,787
I'm sure she said no tonight.

1137
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:28,951
So now the route is through Paul via me.

1138
01:03:29,128 --> 01:03:29,992
You don't hesitate
to use anybody for anything,

1139
01:03:30,163 --> 01:03:34,657
Do you?
Oh, I hesitate.

1140
01:03:34,867 --> 01:03:37,836
I hesitate until I'm sure of
the desires of those con

1141
01:03:38,004 --> 01:03:40,996
Good night.

1142
01:04:12,238 --> 01:04:14,968
To begin with,
a nice clear champagne soup,

1143
01:04:15,141 --> 01:04:17,769
And then I think
a fricassee of champagne.

1144
01:04:17,944 --> 01:04:18,933
No vegetables.

1145
01:04:19,112 --> 01:04:21,171
But a crisp champagne salad.
Excellent.

1146
01:04:21,347 --> 01:04:24,180
And for dessert?
A small champagne souffle.

1147
01:04:24,350 --> 01:04:26,910
1921 is a very good year for souffle.

1148
01:04:27,086 --> 01:04:30,249
I really don't like champagne.
I only like what it do

1149
01:04:30,423 --> 01:04:32,391
You won't like it in the morning.

1150
01:04:32,558 --> 01:04:33,650
I'll adore it in the morning.

1151
01:04:33,826 --> 01:04:36,294
I'll have a fantastically
enormous hangover,

1152
01:04:36,462 --> 01:04:38,657
And your friend Boynin will be furious!

1153
01:04:38,831 --> 01:04:43,427
Do you know what he is?
Vodka... quick, hard, sharp. A

1154
01:04:43,603 --> 01:04:45,195
Champagne, I hope.

1155
01:04:45,371 --> 01:04:46,633
Don't be greedy.

1156
01:04:46,806 --> 01:04:50,469
As a little girl, you used to say that.
Oh, no. Not t

1157
01:04:50,643 --> 01:04:52,133
How many times have we been together?

1158
01:04:52,311 --> 01:04:54,006
Four, five...
Three.

1159
01:04:54,180 --> 01:04:58,708
Well, every time, I've heard
your mind click, click,

1160
01:04:58,885 --> 01:05:00,716
"is she? Isn't she? Is she?"

1161
01:05:00,887 --> 01:05:05,756
It's very, very unattractive of you
and very noisy.

1162
01:05:05,925 --> 01:05:08,223
Tonight I just want to have a good time.

1163
01:05:08,394 --> 01:05:10,919
Do you know who I am?

1164
01:05:11,097 --> 01:05:13,088
No. A woman.

1165
01:05:13,266 --> 01:05:14,927
An extremely attractive one.

1166
01:05:15,101 --> 01:05:17,968
Then behave accordingly.

1167
01:05:18,137 --> 01:05:20,264
Well, let's... That's difficult.

1168
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:22,271
And no click, click, click.

1169
01:05:22,442 --> 01:05:25,434
Not a one.

1170
01:05:35,988 --> 01:05:37,649
1921,

1171
01:05:37,824 --> 01:05:38,916
Definitely.

1172
01:05:39,092 --> 01:05:41,219
Excuse me, your Highness.
I apologize for the intrusi

1173
01:05:41,394 --> 01:05:43,919
But Her Highness has not yet
recovered from her illne

1174
01:05:44,097 --> 01:05:46,998
Her doctor has given strict orders
that she retire ea

1175
01:05:47,166 --> 01:05:51,159
Vodka! Pure vodka!

1176
01:06:00,580 --> 01:06:01,911
Poor Cinderella.

1177
01:06:02,081 --> 01:06:04,015
The coach turned back into a pumpkin

1178
01:06:04,183 --> 01:06:06,117
And the footman into a big, white rat.

1179
01:06:06,285 --> 01:06:07,183
Your Highness.

1180
01:06:07,353 --> 01:06:09,116
Don't you think
the glass slipper cut her foot?

1181
01:06:09,288 --> 01:06:12,121
Good night, your Highness.
Oh, that ugly stepsister.

1182
01:06:12,291 --> 01:06:15,556
Good night. Thank you.

1183
01:06:15,728 --> 01:06:17,218
And thank you!

1184
01:06:17,396 --> 01:06:20,888
Thank you.
Pleasant dreams.

1185
01:06:21,067 --> 01:06:25,527
Good evening.
Ah... ah... I forgot.

1186
01:06:25,705 --> 01:06:27,366
My compliments to the chef.

1187
01:06:27,540 --> 01:06:30,532
Ha ha ha ha!

1188
01:06:31,377 --> 01:06:33,345
Well, good night, Boynin.
May I speak to you for a mo

1189
01:06:33,513 --> 01:06:39,008
It's very late.
It's very important.

1190
01:06:43,856 --> 01:06:45,551
All right, I enjoy her company,

1191
01:06:45,725 --> 01:06:47,386
And I agree she's a beautiful woman.

1192
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:50,757
But the possibility
of inheriting 10 million?

1193
01:06:50,930 --> 01:06:54,764
Boynin, everyone is boringly
aware of my weakness and

1194
01:06:54,934 --> 01:06:56,799
For beauty and money.

1195
01:06:56,969 --> 01:06:58,664
Personally, I don't think
it's so inhuman of us.

1196
01:06:58,838 --> 01:07:00,362
They're the two most
desirable items in the world.

1197
01:07:00,540 --> 01:07:03,236
All right. What do you propose to do?

1198
01:07:03,409 --> 01:07:05,934
At times you push too hard.

1199
01:07:06,112 --> 01:07:08,103
Her visa expires in four days.

1200
01:07:08,281 --> 01:07:09,771
If she hasn't seen
the empress by that time...

1201
01:07:09,949 --> 01:07:12,543
You've been knocking
too loudly on the door, Boynin.

1202
01:07:12,718 --> 01:07:14,083
It is precisely when my aunt thinks

1203
01:07:14,253 --> 01:07:15,914
That somebody is trying to
force her to do something

1204
01:07:16,088 --> 01:07:17,055
That she does nothing.

1205
01:07:17,223 --> 01:07:18,656
When do you do something?

1206
01:07:18,824 --> 01:07:22,419
That depends.
On the odds?

1207
01:07:22,595 --> 01:07:24,586
You're pushing again.

1208
01:07:24,764 --> 01:07:26,629
They're high this time, my dear prince.

1209
01:07:26,799 --> 01:07:28,289
Very high.

1210
01:07:28,467 --> 01:07:31,459
Good night.

1211
01:07:43,249 --> 01:07:46,241
One, two...

1212
01:07:46,752 --> 01:07:49,744
Three, four!

1213
01:07:51,524 --> 01:07:52,821
General?

1214
01:07:52,992 --> 01:07:54,619
General, I'm hungry.

1215
01:07:54,794 --> 01:07:56,421
You just came from a restaurant,
didn't you?

1216
01:07:56,596 --> 01:07:58,996
Ha ha! That's such a funny restaurant!

1217
01:07:59,165 --> 01:08:03,033
No food!
Why don't you take me there tomorrow?

1218
01:08:03,202 --> 01:08:06,535
You had too much to drink.
No. Not quite enough.

1219
01:08:06,706 --> 01:08:08,367
Shall I call for some more?

1220
01:08:08,541 --> 01:08:11,169
No!
"No!"

1221
01:08:11,344 --> 01:08:13,710
It must be very dreary in your room.

1222
01:08:13,879 --> 01:08:18,942
Everyone in mine
Is having a wonderful time.

1223
01:08:19,118 --> 01:08:21,643
Would you care to join us?

1224
01:08:21,821 --> 01:08:23,015
Would you please stop
the nonsense and go to sleep?

1225
01:08:23,189 --> 01:08:25,020
Go to sleep

1226
01:08:25,191 --> 01:08:29,252
Plea... plea... Plea... please
General, I have a confes

1227
01:08:29,428 --> 01:08:30,759
I was lying.

1228
01:08:30,930 --> 01:08:33,364
There's no one here but me.

1229
01:08:33,532 --> 01:08:35,193
Can you hear me?

1230
01:08:35,368 --> 01:08:38,804
General!
Why don't you make a concession?

1231
01:08:38,971 --> 01:08:42,065
Ah... a...
I... I mean confession.

1232
01:08:42,241 --> 01:08:45,506
Well, it's the same thing.
Come on, general.

1233
01:08:45,678 --> 01:08:47,737
One little confession.

1234
01:08:47,913 --> 01:08:53,909
One sweet, tiny confession.

1235
01:09:49,542 --> 01:09:51,976
Prince Paul was asking for you twice,
Your Majesty.

1236
01:09:52,144 --> 01:09:56,137
Thank you, Fedev.

1237
01:10:07,159 --> 01:10:10,026
Good afternoon, Your Majesty.
Did Her Majesty enjoy t

1238
01:10:10,196 --> 01:10:11,959
Yes. It was quiet for a change.

1239
01:10:12,131 --> 01:10:14,065
Prince Paul...
I heard he called twice.

1240
01:10:14,233 --> 01:10:16,224
He's still waiting, Your Majesty.

1241
01:10:16,402 --> 01:10:18,597
Sorry, Your Majesty,
to be so persistent, but it is,

1242
01:10:18,771 --> 01:10:19,669
Money?

1243
01:10:19,839 --> 01:10:20,703
Much more important.

1244
01:10:20,873 --> 01:10:25,367
Oh. A woman.
Very well. Come in.

1245
01:10:29,949 --> 01:10:31,883
Well.
Who is she?

1246
01:10:32,051 --> 01:10:33,450
I'll come straight to the point,
your Highness.

1247
01:10:33,619 --> 01:10:34,813
You usually do.

1248
01:10:34,987 --> 01:10:39,447
Is Her Majesty back?
Yes.

1249
01:10:39,625 --> 01:10:41,388
Late, dear countess. Late.

1250
01:10:41,560 --> 01:10:43,551
Lievenbaum, I'm in no mood for you.

1251
01:10:43,729 --> 01:10:45,924
I had to go all the way
to town on the trolley,

1252
01:10:46,098 --> 01:10:47,793
On the trolley, my dear, while you...

1253
01:10:47,967 --> 01:10:51,869
Oh, your bursitis again.
I do not have bursitis. I ha

1254
01:10:52,037 --> 01:10:53,197
In the shoulder?

1255
01:10:53,372 --> 01:10:55,135
Another area wouldn't
surprise me as much.

1256
01:10:55,307 --> 01:10:58,708
Lievenbaum, enough is...
Shh!

1257
01:10:58,878 --> 01:11:00,778
Is there someone in there with her?
Paul.

1258
01:11:00,946 --> 01:11:02,243
Paul?

1259
01:11:02,415 --> 01:11:05,043
You know he's been seen
publicly with that woman?

1260
01:11:05,217 --> 01:11:07,082
Which woman?
The impostor!

1261
01:11:07,253 --> 01:11:10,222
Prenez Garde, Comtesse.
Perhaps the empress will acce

1262
01:11:10,389 --> 01:11:12,254
You mean he's going to talk her into it?

1263
01:11:12,425 --> 01:11:13,892
She's getting old.
Never!

1264
01:11:14,059 --> 01:11:19,258
Never! And lonely
And she...

1265
01:11:19,432 --> 01:11:23,926
Never!
Lievenbaum!

1266
01:11:33,312 --> 01:11:35,906
Your Majesty?

1267
01:11:36,081 --> 01:11:38,174
Do you know what he wanted?

1268
01:11:38,350 --> 01:11:39,977
I can imagine, Your Majesty.

1269
01:11:40,152 --> 01:11:42,382
To receive that woman!

1270
01:11:42,555 --> 01:11:45,991
How easily he swallows
the tricks she performs.

1271
01:11:46,158 --> 01:11:47,090
And what do they prove?

1272
01:11:47,259 --> 01:11:50,524
That she can memorize
the teachings of Boynin.

1273
01:11:50,696 --> 01:11:51,822
What if there is a resemblance?

1274
01:11:51,997 --> 01:11:55,524
What if she does think she is Anastasia?

1275
01:11:55,701 --> 01:11:59,159
Wanting a dream does not make it true.

1276
01:11:59,338 --> 01:12:03,832
She's a fraud. She must be.

1277
01:12:04,009 --> 01:12:07,001
Well, isn't she?
I...

1278
01:12:07,179 --> 01:12:11,445
Don't know, Your Majesty.

1279
01:12:11,617 --> 01:12:14,381
You all think I'm stubborn, don't you?

1280
01:12:14,553 --> 01:12:15,884
I am.

1281
01:12:16,055 --> 01:12:19,047
Very stubborn.

1282
01:12:19,658 --> 01:12:23,651
Perhaps too stubborn.

1283
01:12:24,930 --> 01:12:29,026
At what hotel is she staying?

1284
01:12:29,201 --> 01:12:32,170
"Believe me, I really tried.
My sincere regrets."

1285
01:12:32,338 --> 01:12:35,637
Sincere! Signed, "Paul."

1286
01:12:35,808 --> 01:12:37,469
Miserable handwriting.

1287
01:12:37,643 --> 01:12:39,440
You think he really saw the empress?

1288
01:12:39,612 --> 01:12:40,806
What's the difference whether he did

1289
01:12:40,980 --> 01:12:42,914
And she refused, or whether he didn't?

1290
01:12:43,082 --> 01:12:48,918
The answer is the same for us... no.

1291
01:12:49,088 --> 01:12:52,182
Hello.
Yes.

1292
01:12:52,358 --> 01:12:54,053
And who?

1293
01:12:54,226 --> 01:12:55,784
Thank you.

1294
01:12:55,961 --> 01:12:58,429
Baroness Von Lievenbaum is
on her way up with a lady.

1295
01:12:58,597 --> 01:12:59,962
What lady?

1296
01:13:00,132 --> 01:13:04,125
I think you'd better go inside,
both of you.

1297
01:13:04,303 --> 01:13:06,635
Lady?
Do you think it is...

1298
01:13:06,805 --> 01:13:11,299
Yes, I do.
Petrovin, come!

1299
01:13:13,145 --> 01:13:14,840
Who is on the way up?

1300
01:13:15,014 --> 01:13:17,107
I think the empress.

1301
01:13:17,283 --> 01:13:19,945
She's coming here? Now?

1302
01:13:20,119 --> 01:13:22,019
I don't think I'll be able to face her.
Don't be a fo

1303
01:13:22,187 --> 01:13:24,178
No, I'm not well enough. Must it be now?

1304
01:13:24,356 --> 01:13:26,620
If I only could have some time...

1305
01:13:26,792 --> 01:13:29,784
Get ready.

1306
01:13:37,670 --> 01:13:42,164
Your Majesty.
Wait downstairs, Lievenbaum.

1307
01:13:45,277 --> 01:13:46,801
I am deeply grateful, Your Majesty.

1308
01:13:46,979 --> 01:13:49,607
I hope that you won't allow
your opinion of me to int

1309
01:13:49,782 --> 01:13:52,774
Bring her in!

1310
01:13:59,325 --> 01:14:05,321
Your Highness, Her Majesty's waiting.

1311
01:14:05,731 --> 01:14:08,723
Courage.

1312
01:14:23,816 --> 01:14:25,147
Yes.

1313
01:14:25,317 --> 01:14:27,114
The resemblance is quite good enough

1314
01:14:27,286 --> 01:14:29,720
For a waxworks gallery.

1315
01:14:29,888 --> 01:14:32,049
Don't you recognize me?
Should I?

1316
01:14:32,224 --> 01:14:34,454
Who are you? Where were you born?

1317
01:14:34,627 --> 01:14:37,255
My birth certificate says Tsarskoe Selo,

1318
01:14:37,429 --> 01:14:39,488
But I was really born in Peterhof.

1319
01:14:39,665 --> 01:14:43,601
Daughter, no doubt,
to Tsar Nicholas II and alexandra

1320
01:14:43,769 --> 01:14:47,762
And granddaughter to Maria Feodorovna,
Dowager Empres

1321
01:14:47,940 --> 01:14:51,137
I have received too many appeals
from resurrected Rom

1322
01:14:51,310 --> 01:14:52,868
The firings squads were such poor shots,

1323
01:14:53,045 --> 01:14:55,809
It's amazing the revolution succeeded.

1324
01:14:55,981 --> 01:14:58,916
Twice I started off to find you, but...

1325
01:14:59,084 --> 01:15:00,676
There were so many days,
weeks, even months

1326
01:15:00,853 --> 01:15:02,411
When I didn't know who I was.

1327
01:15:02,588 --> 01:15:04,783
And now you do?

1328
01:15:04,957 --> 01:15:07,983
I thought I did,
but if you don't know me...

1329
01:15:08,160 --> 01:15:10,856
Have I changed so much, Your Majesty?

1330
01:15:11,030 --> 01:15:13,362
One does not change, mademoiselle.

1331
01:15:13,532 --> 01:15:14,863
No.

1332
01:15:15,034 --> 01:15:17,002
Not if one is loved.

1333
01:15:17,169 --> 01:15:19,433
Perhaps if love had not been
cut off so abruptly,

1334
01:15:19,605 --> 01:15:21,163
I would not have changed so much.

1335
01:15:21,340 --> 01:15:23,467
You are making vulgar
and sentimental use

1336
01:15:23,642 --> 01:15:26,634
Of an episode which is for me
a great personal sorrow

1337
01:15:26,812 --> 01:15:27,710
Forgive me.

1338
01:15:27,880 --> 01:15:29,939
I forgot for a moment that
you would regard that trag

1339
01:15:30,115 --> 01:15:33,084
As more yours than mine.

1340
01:15:33,252 --> 01:15:34,446
Oh, I'm trying,

1341
01:15:34,620 --> 01:15:37,088
But you're making it
very difficult for me, grandmama

1342
01:15:37,256 --> 01:15:40,623
I did not give you permission
to call me that!

1343
01:15:40,793 --> 01:15:43,318
I'm sorry.

1344
01:15:43,495 --> 01:15:44,325
You think a lonely old woman

1345
01:15:44,496 --> 01:15:46,862
Should be eager to hear
someone call her grandmama?

1346
01:15:47,032 --> 01:15:48,795
My loneliness has been
as sharp as yours.

1347
01:15:48,967 --> 01:15:50,832
We are, most of us, lonely,

1348
01:15:51,003 --> 01:15:52,732
And it is mostly of our own making,

1349
01:15:52,905 --> 01:15:55,669
But no masquerade of any kind
can fill the emptiness.

1350
01:15:55,841 --> 01:15:58,105
You asked me for recognition.
You do it well.

1351
01:15:58,277 --> 01:16:01,678
Your eyes are moist,
your voice blurred with feeling.

1352
01:16:01,847 --> 01:16:04,680
I believe you are lonely
and you want love.

1353
01:16:04,850 --> 01:16:06,579
Who does not?

1354
01:16:06,752 --> 01:16:09,585
But the love you beg from me
belongs to one who is de

1355
01:16:09,755 --> 01:16:10,847
Are you so sure?

1356
01:16:11,023 --> 01:16:13,253
You have won the endorsement
of the sentimental,

1357
01:16:13,425 --> 01:16:15,052
The greedy... I am none of those.

1358
01:16:15,227 --> 01:16:18,458
So you shut me out
before you even opened that door.

1359
01:16:18,630 --> 01:16:20,461
I was told you would
ask me difficult questions,

1360
01:16:20,632 --> 01:16:22,532
And you are not even
interested enough to ask me one.

1361
01:16:22,701 --> 01:16:25,397
No, I am not interested in
a demonstration of the tri

1362
01:16:25,571 --> 01:16:26,731
Taught to you
by your business associates.

1363
01:16:26,905 --> 01:16:28,270
But I care nothing about their business.

1364
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:29,771
I care nothing about the money!

1365
01:16:29,942 --> 01:16:31,432
Ah, but you know of the inheritance.

1366
01:16:31,610 --> 01:16:33,339
I know what they told me.

1367
01:16:33,512 --> 01:16:35,104
I don't want money.

1368
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:37,111
Tell me to whom it should be given,
and I'll give it.

1369
01:16:37,282 --> 01:16:39,580
Easily said, but you cannot
give it away until you ha

1370
01:16:39,752 --> 01:16:43,017
And you cannot get it
without first obtaining my reco

1371
01:16:43,188 --> 01:16:45,554
It's useless to say that
that is not what I want.

1372
01:16:45,724 --> 01:16:47,385
You're so hard.

1373
01:16:47,559 --> 01:16:49,789
I remember hearing father say that
in a fight you wer

1374
01:16:49,962 --> 01:16:51,657
Than anyone in the family.

1375
01:16:51,830 --> 01:16:54,731
I thought at the time that
that was a very strong wor

1376
01:16:54,900 --> 01:16:56,834
Just because you
and my mother were quarreling

1377
01:16:57,002 --> 01:17:00,995
Over a necklace.
Some... some emeralds, yes.

1378
01:17:01,173 --> 01:17:02,765
You wanted to keep them though

1379
01:17:02,941 --> 01:17:04,272
They belonged to the imperial treasury.

1380
01:17:04,443 --> 01:17:06,001
Who told you that?

1381
01:17:06,178 --> 01:17:08,009
Oh, there were many
who could have known.

1382
01:17:08,180 --> 01:17:09,374
You wore them
with your last court dress,

1383
01:17:09,548 --> 01:17:12,745
Green and gold velvet and a long train.

1384
01:17:12,918 --> 01:17:15,614
The photograph was unflattering
but accurate.

1385
01:17:15,788 --> 01:17:18,313
My father took my mother's side
in the quarrel.

1386
01:17:18,490 --> 01:17:20,549
There they were,
all of them against you,

1387
01:17:20,726 --> 01:17:23,752
But you were stubborn.
You kept Figgy's emeralds.

1388
01:17:23,929 --> 01:17:26,625
How did you learn to call
Catherine the great Figgy?

1389
01:17:26,799 --> 01:17:28,767
We always called her that.

1390
01:17:28,934 --> 01:17:30,333
Sometimes we gave the nickname to Maria

1391
01:17:30,502 --> 01:17:31,992
Because she had such an eye for the men,

1392
01:17:32,171 --> 01:17:34,731
And Olga used to say...
Stop!

1393
01:17:34,907 --> 01:17:37,137
I forbid you to bandy those names!

1394
01:17:37,309 --> 01:17:38,936
I can speak of them if I choose.

1395
01:17:39,111 --> 01:17:44,413
They are my sisters.
Impostor!

1396
01:17:44,583 --> 01:17:45,709
You call me that?

1397
01:17:45,884 --> 01:17:48,682
If you have any decency,
end this charade at once!

1398
01:17:48,854 --> 01:17:49,582
I will pay you.

1399
01:17:49,755 --> 01:17:51,222
I will give you more than
whatever Boynin...

1400
01:17:51,390 --> 01:17:53,119
Go away!
I'm offering you money.

1401
01:17:53,292 --> 01:17:56,591
Please go.
So you are giving up.

1402
01:17:56,762 --> 01:17:58,525
So it wasn't enough
I suffered the asylum,

1403
01:17:58,697 --> 01:18:00,927
Some people trying me,
using me, rejecting me!

1404
01:18:01,099 --> 01:18:02,964
And before that
the cellar and the flight.

1405
01:18:03,135 --> 01:18:05,228
The rescue from the very edge
of the grave?

1406
01:18:05,404 --> 01:18:06,996
Years of lost memory in an asylum?

1407
01:18:07,172 --> 01:18:08,833
Excellent material for melodrama.

1408
01:18:09,007 --> 01:18:11,703
Long, empty days in which
the consciousness of living

1409
01:18:11,877 --> 01:18:13,572
Came only through pain.

1410
01:18:13,745 --> 01:18:16,145
Hardly melodrama.

1411
01:18:16,315 --> 01:18:19,443
And then slowly, finally struggling up

1412
01:18:19,618 --> 01:18:24,180
Out of the water into the light,
into the air, thinki

1413
01:18:24,356 --> 01:18:26,517
Yes, perhaps, yes...

1414
01:18:26,692 --> 01:18:27,750
I may be...

1415
01:18:27,926 --> 01:18:30,759
I must be...
I am.

1416
01:18:30,929 --> 01:18:35,525
I am and my grandmother is still
alive to tell me so!

1417
01:18:35,701 --> 01:18:39,967
My grandmother is alive
to hold out her hand full of

1418
01:18:40,138 --> 01:18:43,369
The tragic scene of despair.

1419
01:18:43,542 --> 01:18:46,670
Well done.
You're forgetting nothing, are you?

1420
01:18:46,845 --> 01:18:49,780
I am sorry, mademoiselle,
that your failure to win me

1421
01:18:49,948 --> 01:18:52,746
Is such a cruel disappointment.
Good-bye.

1422
01:18:52,918 --> 01:18:55,716
Oh, don't go!
But you just told me to.

1423
01:18:55,888 --> 01:18:58,618
I promise I will not say anything more
to try and con

1424
01:18:58,790 --> 01:18:59,848
Then what do you want of me?

1425
01:19:00,025 --> 01:19:02,892
A moment or two longer.
a moment more to be with you,

1426
01:19:03,061 --> 01:19:05,894
To pretend you do not think what you do,

1427
01:19:06,064 --> 01:19:09,033
To close my eyes
and pretend it is years ago...

1428
01:19:09,201 --> 01:19:10,930
A terrace in the summer sun.

1429
01:19:11,103 --> 01:19:12,661
No... no, no! I promise.

1430
01:19:12,838 --> 01:19:16,535
I promise I will not
say names or places.

1431
01:19:16,708 --> 01:19:19,939
The smell of the sea air,
the sound of a tennis ball,

1432
01:19:20,112 --> 01:19:23,411
The laughter from the courts
behind the trees

1433
01:19:23,582 --> 01:19:26,483
And your voice calling me Malenkaya.

1434
01:19:26,652 --> 01:19:28,210
And then the sudden...

1435
01:19:28,387 --> 01:19:31,652
Lightning in the summer sk... sky.

1436
01:19:31,823 --> 01:19:33,757
Are you ill?

1437
01:19:33,926 --> 01:19:36,759
I was, but I'm not now.

1438
01:19:36,929 --> 01:19:39,523
Have you seen a doctor? A good one?

1439
01:19:39,698 --> 01:19:42,997
I'm well acquainted with doctors,
but it is kind of y

1440
01:19:43,168 --> 01:19:43,862
I'd better go.

1441
01:19:44,036 --> 01:19:46,129
I'm really not surprised that
you do not recognize me

1442
01:19:46,305 --> 01:19:47,932
I have changed very much, indeed.

1443
01:19:48,106 --> 01:19:49,437
You asked for just one moment.

1444
01:19:49,608 --> 01:19:51,599
What is strange is that
you have changed so little.

1445
01:19:51,777 --> 01:19:54,871
It is as though the horror
of all these last years

1446
01:19:55,047 --> 01:19:56,708
Has only made you stronger.

1447
01:19:56,882 --> 01:19:58,611
I am not strong, mademoiselle.
Let me go.

1448
01:19:58,784 --> 01:20:00,251
You are too clever for me.
I'm an old woman.

1449
01:20:00,419 --> 01:20:02,910
My strength is only outward now.

1450
01:20:03,088 --> 01:20:04,282
At least we met again.

1451
01:20:04,456 --> 01:20:07,084
And we will another time
when my mind is clearer.

1452
01:20:07,259 --> 01:20:10,285
But now...
No, we better not meet again.

1453
01:20:10,462 --> 01:20:13,954
You have softened towards me,
But later you'll regret

1454
01:20:14,132 --> 01:20:16,259
You'll say it was all acting.

1455
01:20:16,435 --> 01:20:19,097
She was some cheap little actress
they hired for mone

1456
01:20:19,271 --> 01:20:21,967
And... in a way, they did hire me.

1457
01:20:22,140 --> 01:20:25,337
I was starving
after I ran from the last asylum.

1458
01:20:25,510 --> 01:20:27,171
I had nowhere to go.

1459
01:20:27,346 --> 01:20:29,576
Boynin found me
on the bank of the seine.

1460
01:20:29,748 --> 01:20:31,841
Maybe there is more good
to him than we think,

1461
01:20:32,017 --> 01:20:33,484
Or maybe I should have
run away from him, too,

1462
01:20:33,652 --> 01:20:37,019
But I was so tired of running.

1463
01:20:37,189 --> 01:20:39,350
Are you all right?

1464
01:20:39,524 --> 01:20:42,687
Yes. And if it is better
for you not to believe...

1465
01:20:42,861 --> 01:20:44,453
You are ill.

1466
01:20:44,629 --> 01:20:48,258
No. I cough only
because I'm a little frightened.

1467
01:20:48,433 --> 01:20:50,867
It doesn't mean...

1468
01:20:51,036 --> 01:20:54,767
Say that again.

1469
01:20:54,940 --> 01:21:00,640
That I cough when I'm frightened?

1470
01:21:00,812 --> 01:21:07,149
When you were a little girl,
you coughed when you wer

1471
01:21:07,319 --> 01:21:08,752
Malenkaya.

1472
01:21:08,920 --> 01:21:11,115
Malenkaya.

1473
01:21:11,289 --> 01:21:16,158
You have come from so far away,
and I've waited so lo

1474
01:21:16,328 --> 01:21:17,920
No, no, no. Don't cry.

1475
01:21:18,096 --> 01:21:19,961
There's no need to be frightened.

1476
01:21:20,132 --> 01:21:22,464
Don't speak. You are safe, Anastasia.

1477
01:21:22,634 --> 01:21:24,295
You are with me. You're home.

1478
01:21:24,469 --> 01:21:26,096
The phantoms can go.

1479
01:21:26,271 --> 01:21:28,637
The closed rooms can be opened.

1480
01:21:28,807 --> 01:21:32,174
You know, I have a footman
who is a very old man,

1481
01:21:32,344 --> 01:21:34,778
And each night,
he goes from one room to the other,

1482
01:21:34,946 --> 01:21:38,313
Lighting the empty lamps
until the great, dark rooms

1483
01:21:38,483 --> 01:21:40,212
Are a blaze of light.

1484
01:21:40,385 --> 01:21:42,250
Perhaps that is true of all of us.

1485
01:21:42,421 --> 01:21:43,786
We are lighting dead lamps

1486
01:21:43,955 --> 01:21:45,855
To illumine a past that is gone.

1487
01:21:46,024 --> 01:21:50,927
I thought you were gone,
but you have come back, Anas

1488
01:21:51,096 --> 01:21:55,055
You have come back.

1489
01:21:55,233 --> 01:21:56,598
But, oh, please...

1490
01:21:56,768 --> 01:22:03,264
If it should not be you,
don't ever tell me.

1491
01:22:29,101 --> 01:22:31,831
Many beautiful shops and restaurants.
Yes.

1492
01:22:32,003 --> 01:22:34,733
Also, we might make
a small trip to America.

1493
01:22:34,906 --> 01:22:36,635
After all, it's the only country left

1494
01:22:36,808 --> 01:22:38,799
With proper respect for wealth.

1495
01:22:38,977 --> 01:22:41,639
I hate trips.
I would like to go to Uruguay.

1496
01:22:41,813 --> 01:22:43,212
Yes? Why?

1497
01:22:43,381 --> 01:22:45,212
I like the name... Uruguay.

1498
01:22:45,383 --> 01:22:49,319
I hate it.
And Guatemala. They sound so far away.

1499
01:22:49,488 --> 01:22:51,615
Yes, very.
Why don't you charter a boat

1500
01:22:51,790 --> 01:22:53,348
And sail the high seas?

1501
01:22:53,525 --> 01:22:54,787
I hate the sea.

1502
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:56,951
My dear maxim, you are here to eat,

1503
01:22:57,129 --> 01:22:58,790
Drink, enjoy the show,
and have a good time.

1504
01:22:58,964 --> 01:23:01,626
I hate Russian food.
I hate bad champagne.

1505
01:23:01,800 --> 01:23:04,792
I'm sick of those gypsies,
and I'm having a terrible

1506
01:23:04,970 --> 01:23:06,767
Then why don't you go home?

1507
01:23:06,938 --> 01:23:13,434
I hate my room even more.
So soon?

1508
01:23:19,718 --> 01:23:21,083
Hey, he's back from the station.

1509
01:23:21,253 --> 01:23:28,750
Maybe she's not on the train.
Maybe.

1510
01:23:31,830 --> 01:23:34,230
Anything wrong? Did you meet the train?

1511
01:23:34,399 --> 01:23:36,299
She was on it?

1512
01:23:36,468 --> 01:23:40,461
The Empress? Paul?

1513
01:23:41,806 --> 01:23:45,071
Well?
Everything is up...

1514
01:23:45,243 --> 01:23:47,438
Go powder your nose.

1515
01:23:47,612 --> 01:23:49,603
How long should I take?

1516
01:23:49,781 --> 01:23:51,942
We'll call you. Go on. Go on.

1517
01:23:52,117 --> 01:23:54,483
Well, Petrovanch,

1518
01:23:54,653 --> 01:23:55,915
They all arrived.

1519
01:23:56,087 --> 01:23:58,612
Then why isn't he at the hotel with her?

1520
01:23:58,790 --> 01:24:01,122
Yes. Probably it is Copenhagen
all over again.

1521
01:24:01,293 --> 01:24:02,385
I said he should have stayed there.

1522
01:24:02,561 --> 01:24:04,188
"Stayed there." but the empress

1523
01:24:04,362 --> 01:24:05,761
Would not let him see Her Highness,

1524
01:24:05,931 --> 01:24:07,626
Or at least that's what Paul said.

1525
01:24:07,799 --> 01:24:13,795
No. It was wasting money to stay.

1526
01:24:29,888 --> 01:24:31,913
Von Lievenbaum is expecting you
at 10:00 in the morni

1527
01:24:32,090 --> 01:24:33,057
You mean they agreed

1528
01:24:33,225 --> 01:24:35,557
To the presentation ceremony
tomorrow night? Wonderfu

1529
01:24:35,727 --> 01:24:37,627
Then we can have
the press conference at 7:3o.

1530
01:24:37,796 --> 01:24:39,423
In the grand ballroom of their hotel.

1531
01:24:39,598 --> 01:24:41,623
Good.
What about the marriage rumors?

1532
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:47,295
Yes. You will announce
her engagement to Paul?

1533
01:24:57,649 --> 01:24:59,742
You know, every time Paul is mentioned,

1534
01:24:59,918 --> 01:25:01,112
He gets peculiar.

1535
01:25:01,286 --> 01:25:02,583
You don't think he's getting jealous?

1536
01:25:02,754 --> 01:25:06,451
Yes. I began to think back
in Copenhagen.

1537
01:25:06,625 --> 01:25:08,490
You're eating like a pig again.

1538
01:25:08,660 --> 01:25:12,653
I'm nervous again.

1539
01:25:15,367 --> 01:25:17,062
Where the devil did that come from?

1540
01:25:17,235 --> 01:25:20,261
The opera warehouse.
I think it is very impressive.

1541
01:25:20,438 --> 01:25:22,429
Fran, get rid of those lights.

1542
01:25:22,607 --> 01:25:25,007
What time is it?

1543
01:25:25,176 --> 01:25:26,507
7:40.

1544
01:25:26,678 --> 01:25:28,475
The press has already been
waiting for her.

1545
01:25:28,647 --> 01:25:30,376
Too late to do anything
about that throne.

1546
01:25:30,548 --> 01:25:33,574
For heaven's sakes,
stop that nonsense. Petrovin.

1547
01:25:33,752 --> 01:25:35,720
But they are rehearsing.
They rehearse later.

1548
01:25:35,887 --> 01:25:40,221
Please, gentlemen. Please.
After the press conference

1549
01:25:40,392 --> 01:25:42,656
I am confused. Confused!

1550
01:25:42,827 --> 01:25:44,351
When we originally discussed the pres...

1551
01:25:44,529 --> 01:25:46,224
Stepal, tell Her Highness we're ready.

1552
01:25:46,398 --> 01:25:48,389
Petrovin, let the press in.

1553
01:25:48,566 --> 01:25:50,056
Did you see her? Did you talk to her?

1554
01:25:50,235 --> 01:25:51,361
Chernov, I told you 5o times,

1555
01:25:51,536 --> 01:25:53,128
I have not seen her
nor him nor the empress.

1556
01:25:53,305 --> 01:25:56,763
Perhaps if I write it
very carefully in very big lett

1557
01:25:56,941 --> 01:25:59,876
Well, I'm sorry.
I'm bored with the whole business.

1558
01:26:00,045 --> 01:26:01,410
The sooner it's over with, the better.

1559
01:26:01,579 --> 01:26:03,012
You certainly have changed, Excellency,

1560
01:26:03,181 --> 01:26:06,082
But don't get too bored.
It is a little too late.

1561
01:26:06,251 --> 01:26:08,947
This way, please.
You'll find copies of the guest lis

1562
01:26:09,120 --> 01:26:10,382
And other information on this table.

1563
01:26:10,555 --> 01:26:12,250
Yes. This is the very room

1564
01:26:12,424 --> 01:26:14,415
In which the presentation
ceremony will take place

1565
01:26:14,592 --> 01:26:17,026
Later this evening.

1566
01:26:17,195 --> 01:26:20,187
Ladies and gentlemen, I regret
you cannot be present

1567
01:26:20,365 --> 01:26:21,923
But such is the wish
of Her Imperial Majesty,

1568
01:26:22,100 --> 01:26:25,035
The dowager empress.
However, Her Imperial Highness,

1569
01:26:25,203 --> 01:26:26,898
The Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolayevna,

1570
01:26:27,072 --> 01:26:28,903
Has most graciously consented
to see you for just a f

1571
01:26:29,074 --> 01:26:31,099
At 9:30, the ball will be opened
by the grand duchess

1572
01:26:31,276 --> 01:26:34,803
And his Highness
Prince Paul Von Herelburg.

1573
01:26:34,979 --> 01:26:37,777
At 10: 15...
Is it true they're going to be married?

1574
01:26:37,949 --> 01:26:39,507
Will the engagement
be announced tonight?

1575
01:26:39,684 --> 01:26:41,515
Well, unofficially and off the record...

1576
01:26:41,686 --> 01:26:42,983
At the present time,
there's no information

1577
01:26:43,154 --> 01:26:44,815
On that subject. Proceed.

1578
01:26:44,989 --> 01:26:48,720
At 10: 15, the dowager empress
will make her appearanc

1579
01:26:48,893 --> 01:26:50,121
At 10:20,

1580
01:26:50,295 --> 01:26:52,627
The Russian national anthem
will be played,

1581
01:26:52,797 --> 01:26:54,765
And Her Majesty
will formally present her...

1582
01:26:54,933 --> 01:26:56,457
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is my humble pleasure

1583
01:26:56,634 --> 01:26:58,625
To present Her Imperial Highness,

1584
01:26:58,803 --> 01:27:04,469
The Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolayevna.

1585
01:27:04,642 --> 01:27:05,973
What a beautiful dress.

1586
01:27:06,144 --> 01:27:07,634
Get a picture of
her coming down the stairs.

1587
01:27:07,812 --> 01:27:11,805
Peter, the flash.

1588
01:27:14,252 --> 01:27:18,450
We'll get some more in a minute.

1589
01:27:18,623 --> 01:27:19,351
What is it?

1590
01:27:19,524 --> 01:27:22,049
Extraordinary taste.
Can we get a picture on the thro

1591
01:27:22,227 --> 01:27:24,889
Her Highness has not fully
recovered from her long il

1592
01:27:25,063 --> 01:27:26,189
So I must request that you be

1593
01:27:26,364 --> 01:27:27,592
As brief as possible
with your questions.

1594
01:27:27,766 --> 01:27:29,131
Your Highness, is it true that it is

1595
01:27:29,300 --> 01:27:30,767
Very difficult for you
to get to see the empress?

1596
01:27:30,935 --> 01:27:32,368
I was three weeks in Copenhagen,

1597
01:27:32,537 --> 01:27:34,266
Almost all of which
I spent with Her Majesty.

1598
01:27:34,439 --> 01:27:36,999
Are you going to marry Prince Paul?

1599
01:27:37,175 --> 01:27:39,370
I found the city extremely
charming and hospitable.

1600
01:27:39,544 --> 01:27:40,670
What about the inheritance,
Your Highness?

1601
01:27:40,845 --> 01:27:43,370
How do you plan to spend it?
Will you get the whole 1

1602
01:27:43,548 --> 01:27:44,810
If I should receive an inheritance,

1603
01:27:44,983 --> 01:27:47,383
It will be more of a surprise
to me than to you.

1604
01:27:47,552 --> 01:27:51,784
Did you go to Romania
After you escaped from Russia?

1605
01:27:51,956 --> 01:27:53,048
Yes.

1606
01:27:53,224 --> 01:27:58,093
Where you in a hospital in Bucharest
in December 1920

1607
01:27:58,263 --> 01:28:00,458
Yes, I was in a hospital in Bucharest.

1608
01:28:00,632 --> 01:28:02,361
When, I do not remember precisely.

1609
01:28:02,534 --> 01:28:04,195
Don't you? I do.

1610
01:28:04,369 --> 01:28:07,497
I was convalescing in the next ward
when they brought

1611
01:28:07,672 --> 01:28:09,003
It is possible.

1612
01:28:09,174 --> 01:28:11,005
Possible, but you don't remember?

1613
01:28:11,176 --> 01:28:12,234
Well, when they discharged you,

1614
01:28:12,410 --> 01:28:14,708
A man was waiting for you
and took you home...

1615
01:28:14,879 --> 01:28:17,871
Me.

1616
01:28:18,316 --> 01:28:20,284
General, I beg you. We cannot...
Quiet.

1617
01:28:20,452 --> 01:28:23,319
What is your name?
Mikhail Vladoss.

1618
01:28:23,488 --> 01:28:26,423
Vladoss.
And yours is Anna Corev.

1619
01:28:26,591 --> 01:28:28,889
Corev? Is that true?

1620
01:28:29,060 --> 01:28:31,119
Yes. I have used that name.

1621
01:28:31,296 --> 01:28:32,490
Her Highness has used many names.

1622
01:28:32,664 --> 01:28:34,188
As you all know,
she has been forced to hide.

1623
01:28:34,365 --> 01:28:37,892
Also, she has suffered amnesia.
Please. Mikhail Vlado

1624
01:28:38,069 --> 01:28:40,162
Yes. We were in the same hospital
in Bucharest.

1625
01:28:40,338 --> 01:28:42,431
They treated you for head wounds.

1626
01:28:42,607 --> 01:28:43,369
They did.

1627
01:28:43,541 --> 01:28:46,374
Which you got in a train explosion
outside Bucharest.

1628
01:28:46,544 --> 01:28:47,943
Were you in a train wreck?

1629
01:28:48,112 --> 01:28:50,080
Are you Anna Corev?

1630
01:28:50,248 --> 01:28:53,046
Please, I would like to answer.
All right.

1631
01:28:53,218 --> 01:28:56,153
Ladies and gentlemen, please.
Please.

1632
01:28:56,321 --> 01:28:59,051
Her Highness cannot hear your questions,
Let alone an

1633
01:28:59,224 --> 01:29:00,657
What is it you wish to know?

1634
01:29:00,825 --> 01:29:03,191
Whether I was wounded in a train
explosion on the way

1635
01:29:03,361 --> 01:29:07,195
Were you?
I remember being in a train explosion.

1636
01:29:07,365 --> 01:29:09,128
Whether or not I was wounded,
I do not know.

1637
01:29:09,300 --> 01:29:12,167
Where did you get the wounds?
In Russia or in Buchare

1638
01:29:12,337 --> 01:29:14,168
Is it not possible to
have been wounded twice?

1639
01:29:14,339 --> 01:29:16,000
In a war, maybe.

1640
01:29:16,174 --> 01:29:17,436
What else is a revolution?

1641
01:29:17,609 --> 01:29:19,474
I'm sorry, ladies and gentlemen.
The interview is ove

1642
01:29:19,644 --> 01:29:22,636
Oh. Oh.

1643
01:29:27,552 --> 01:29:29,747
Stepal, make sure that there are men
posted at every

1644
01:29:29,921 --> 01:29:31,286
To keep the reporters from the guests,

1645
01:29:31,456 --> 01:29:32,923
And check every invitation at the door.

1646
01:29:33,091 --> 01:29:35,025
Yes, sir.

1647
01:29:35,193 --> 01:29:40,392
I don't make things
easier for you, do I?

1648
01:29:40,565 --> 01:29:42,157
Was it a disaster?

1649
01:29:42,333 --> 01:29:44,699
No matter what the papers print,
Before they can be o

1650
01:29:44,869 --> 01:29:46,336
The guests will be here

1651
01:29:46,504 --> 01:29:48,699
And the empress will have
made the presentation.

1652
01:29:48,873 --> 01:29:50,738
Oh, forgive me. May I?

1653
01:29:50,909 --> 01:29:53,104
You may even give me one.

1654
01:29:53,278 --> 01:29:55,007
Thank you.

1655
01:29:55,179 --> 01:29:57,875
The stairs aren't doing
that dress any good.

1656
01:29:58,049 --> 01:30:03,146
It doesn't matter.
It will in an hour.

1657
01:30:03,321 --> 01:30:05,551
I haven't seen you in a long time.

1658
01:30:05,723 --> 01:30:08,021
And you missed me terribly.

1659
01:30:08,192 --> 01:30:10,023
I missed you, yes.

1660
01:30:10,194 --> 01:30:12,992
Whose orders kept you from seeing me...
The Empress'

1661
01:30:13,164 --> 01:30:14,825
Apparently, it has never occurred to you

1662
01:30:14,999 --> 01:30:17,024
That I can function
without orders from anyone.

1663
01:30:17,201 --> 01:30:19,897
Then you didn't want to see me. Why?

1664
01:30:20,071 --> 01:30:22,403
I thought it better not to.

1665
01:30:22,574 --> 01:30:24,542
Then the marriage rumors are true.

1666
01:30:24,709 --> 01:30:27,177
You yourself told me that Paul and I
were engaged yea

1667
01:30:27,345 --> 01:30:29,313
Aren't you taking your royal duties
a bit too serious

1668
01:30:29,480 --> 01:30:30,538
Independently, you mean.

1669
01:30:30,715 --> 01:30:32,649
The puppet has pulled
the strings herself.

1670
01:30:32,817 --> 01:30:35,251
This is childish.
You've always had an obsession

1671
01:30:35,420 --> 01:30:37,115
That people want you to do
only what they tell you.

1672
01:30:37,288 --> 01:30:39,347
No, not people. You.

1673
01:30:39,524 --> 01:30:41,822
Nonsense.
Is it?

1674
01:30:41,993 --> 01:30:45,156
You pushed me at Paul,
And now you're against him. Wh

1675
01:30:45,330 --> 01:30:46,957
Are you afraid that
he's going to be in control?

1676
01:30:47,131 --> 01:30:48,826
Over what?
Over me. Over the money.

1677
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,491
I don't give a hang about the money.

1678
01:30:51,669 --> 01:30:53,603
Then what is bothering you?
That I might be Anna Core

1679
01:30:53,771 --> 01:30:56,433
I don't care what your name is.
I care what you are.

1680
01:30:56,608 --> 01:30:58,974
What bothers me
is the way you've changed.

1681
01:30:59,143 --> 01:31:00,075
I'm the one who has changed.

1682
01:31:00,244 --> 01:31:02,804
Yes. When we began, you merely
wanted to find out who

1683
01:31:02,981 --> 01:31:05,745
You said that was all you wanted.
But is it?

1684
01:31:05,917 --> 01:31:06,941
No.

1685
01:31:07,118 --> 01:31:09,609
Now you must be
the Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolayev

1686
01:31:09,787 --> 01:31:11,049
Now you must be placed upon a throne

1687
01:31:11,222 --> 01:31:12,416
Before a morgue of royal corpses.

1688
01:31:12,590 --> 01:31:14,319
Must you always hate?
Must you always ridicule?

1689
01:31:14,492 --> 01:31:16,517
Ridicule who?
Your loyal, loving subjects?

1690
01:31:16,694 --> 01:31:17,991
Those embalmed skeletons?

1691
01:31:18,162 --> 01:31:19,493
They don't care about you.

1692
01:31:19,664 --> 01:31:20,824
They don't care who is Anastasia

1693
01:31:20,999 --> 01:31:22,227
So long as they can get some money
and a better posit

1694
01:31:22,400 --> 01:31:25,164
In a world that is dead
and buried and should be!

1695
01:31:25,336 --> 01:31:28,203
You didn't say that a month ago.
Then you wanted it f

1696
01:31:28,373 --> 01:31:29,362
Well, now I like it.

1697
01:31:29,540 --> 01:31:32,509
Go on. Like it. Be a grand duchess,
and make it reall

1698
01:31:32,677 --> 01:31:34,907
And marry a man who wouldn't
come within 1o feet of t

1699
01:31:35,079 --> 01:31:37,877
If you were not an heiress.

1700
01:31:38,049 --> 01:31:40,108
Oh, the truth is insulting.

1701
01:31:40,284 --> 01:31:42,275
You told me once that
I was selfish and ambitious,

1702
01:31:42,453 --> 01:31:43,886
And I admitted that you were right.

1703
01:31:44,055 --> 01:31:51,552
Why don't you now have the courage
To admit that I am

1704
01:32:14,919 --> 01:32:16,887
Remember?
What?

1705
01:32:17,055 --> 01:32:19,489
The music. This waltz.
Yes, of course.

1706
01:32:19,657 --> 01:32:21,284
No. You don't really.

1707
01:32:21,459 --> 01:32:25,020
Sorry. Should I?
No. It was a long time ago.

1708
01:32:25,196 --> 01:32:28,825
My first waltz. My first ball.
My first...

1709
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,662
What?
Partner.

1710
01:32:31,836 --> 01:32:33,599
I thought it was you.

1711
01:32:33,771 --> 01:32:35,500
It must have been somebody else.

1712
01:32:35,673 --> 01:32:38,039
It might have been me.
It really doesn't matter.

1713
01:32:38,209 --> 01:32:44,205
It might not have even been at the ball.

1714
01:32:44,982 --> 01:32:46,210
Frankly, I don't understand you.

1715
01:32:46,384 --> 01:32:50,184
Why? Because I didn't
deny what Vladoss said?

1716
01:32:50,354 --> 01:32:51,981
How do you know that
I am not Anna Corev?

1717
01:32:52,156 --> 01:32:53,783
Be serious.
I am.

1718
01:32:53,958 --> 01:32:56,586
You're deliberately behaving
very strangely tonight.

1719
01:32:56,761 --> 01:32:58,854
How do you know how Anna Corev behaves?

1720
01:32:59,030 --> 01:33:02,466
I know how you behave,
And all I care about is you.

1721
01:33:02,633 --> 01:33:05,033
Do you mean that?
Of course.

1722
01:33:05,203 --> 01:33:07,000
Then let's announce
our engagement tonight.

1723
01:33:07,171 --> 01:33:08,160
I want to very much.

1724
01:33:08,339 --> 01:33:11,467
Prince Paul Von Herelburg
to Miss Anna Corev.

1725
01:33:11,642 --> 01:33:15,510
Will you announce that?
Certainly not, because it's n

1726
01:33:15,680 --> 01:33:18,979
No? Suppose I have no title,
no inheritance, nothing.

1727
01:33:19,150 --> 01:33:21,675
I can't suppose that
When I know perfectly well who y

1728
01:33:21,853 --> 01:33:23,753
Still, what if I can't get the money,

1729
01:33:23,921 --> 01:33:25,388
Or if I make no claim to it?

1730
01:33:25,556 --> 01:33:26,921
You can, and you will.

1731
01:33:27,091 --> 01:33:31,084
Why be poor when you can
so easily be very rich?

1732
01:33:31,262 --> 01:33:33,321
The poor have only one advantage...

1733
01:33:33,498 --> 01:33:35,966
They know when they are loved
for themselves.

1734
01:33:36,134 --> 01:33:43,631
Sorry, but I refuse to take
that remark seriously.

1735
01:33:51,215 --> 01:33:52,944
The empress is ready.
She's upstairs in the green roo

1736
01:33:53,117 --> 01:33:54,015
Good.
It's almost time.

1737
01:33:54,185 --> 01:33:56,517
All right.

1738
01:33:56,687 --> 01:33:59,019
Oh, Petrovanch,
should I not be back in time...

1739
01:33:59,190 --> 01:34:03,684
Why not?
Just go ahead without me.

1740
01:34:10,301 --> 01:34:12,667
Sergei Pavlovich, isn't this all superb?

1741
01:34:12,837 --> 01:34:14,099
I have never seen you look so well.

1742
01:34:14,272 --> 01:34:15,899
In this? Oh, ha ha ha.

1743
01:34:16,073 --> 01:34:17,665
They don't know
how to make baggage nowadays.

1744
01:34:17,842 --> 01:34:21,471
Imagine trying to fit this
Into a nasty little modern

1745
01:34:21,646 --> 01:34:23,511
The times aren't suited for elegance,

1746
01:34:23,681 --> 01:34:26,445
But you have brought it back ce soir.

1747
01:34:26,617 --> 01:34:28,016
What's the matter? You look upset.

1748
01:34:28,186 --> 01:34:30,313
No. Just tired.
Would you ask Her Majesty

1749
01:34:30,488 --> 01:34:31,955
If she would receive me
for just a moment?

1750
01:34:32,123 --> 01:34:36,116
You know I will.

1751
01:34:40,865 --> 01:34:44,323
General.
General.

1752
01:34:44,502 --> 01:34:46,129
You may go in.
That's very kind of you.

1753
01:34:46,304 --> 01:34:49,000
But just in case,
she's heard about the reporters.

1754
01:34:49,173 --> 01:34:49,867
Thank you.

1755
01:34:50,041 --> 01:34:55,536
Vasili, Her Majesty
is expecting the general.

1756
01:34:57,181 --> 01:34:59,081
I was going to send for you, Boynin.

1757
01:34:59,250 --> 01:35:00,615
My granddaughter tells me to expect

1758
01:35:00,785 --> 01:35:02,343
Some unpleasantness in the newspapers.

1759
01:35:02,520 --> 01:35:03,509
I'm afraid so, Your Majesty.

1760
01:35:03,688 --> 01:35:06,589
Thank you. The man
was probably a hired troublemaker.

1761
01:35:06,757 --> 01:35:09,555
Well, Her Highness says that actually...
I am aware w

1762
01:35:09,727 --> 01:35:11,160
Unfortunately, she is not aware

1763
01:35:11,329 --> 01:35:14,059
That truth serves
only a world that lives by it.

1764
01:35:14,232 --> 01:35:16,200
I have prepared
a statement for the press

1765
01:35:16,367 --> 01:35:18,494
That I want you to give to them
before you leave toni

1766
01:35:18,669 --> 01:35:21,069
I am leaving now, Your Majesty.

1767
01:35:21,239 --> 01:35:23,764
Why?
I feel that my work is finished...

1768
01:35:23,941 --> 01:35:25,568
Satisfactorily, I trust.

1769
01:35:25,743 --> 01:35:30,077
Since this is your evening,
I felt it my duty...

1770
01:35:30,248 --> 01:35:31,875
No. That isn't quite true.

1771
01:35:32,049 --> 01:35:34,074
I simply wanted to say good-bye to you.

1772
01:35:34,252 --> 01:35:36,345
Extraordinary.

1773
01:35:36,520 --> 01:35:38,954
You want to leave before the spectacle.

1774
01:35:39,123 --> 01:35:40,385
I should have thought
no one would watch it

1775
01:35:40,558 --> 01:35:42,253
With more triumph than you.

1776
01:35:42,426 --> 01:35:44,724
If the evening belongs to anyone,
it is to you.

1777
01:35:44,896 --> 01:35:46,090
We are all grateful.

1778
01:35:46,264 --> 01:35:48,459
Thank you, Your Majesty,
but I want no further part i

1779
01:35:48,633 --> 01:35:51,397
Come. After all,
you've performed an enormous task.

1780
01:35:51,569 --> 01:35:54,060
You've restored my granddaughter
to her rightful posi

1781
01:35:54,238 --> 01:35:56,206
And unless I have been misinformed,

1782
01:35:56,374 --> 01:35:59,070
You even effected her reunion
with her childhood swee

1783
01:35:59,243 --> 01:36:01,108
Yes. To a degree, I suppose I did.

1784
01:36:01,279 --> 01:36:03,247
But you're not particularly
pleased with it, are you?

1785
01:36:03,414 --> 01:36:06,008
Your Majesty...
You're not pleased. Why not?

1786
01:36:06,183 --> 01:36:07,047
But I am not in a position...

1787
01:36:07,218 --> 01:36:10,745
Oh, come. After all,
it's extremely unlike you

1788
01:36:10,922 --> 01:36:11,980
To speak of position, Boynin.

1789
01:36:12,156 --> 01:36:14,351
When I am with Your Majesty,
I'm deeply aware of it.

1790
01:36:14,525 --> 01:36:17,926
Thank you. Then I request you answer.

1791
01:36:18,095 --> 01:36:20,393
If it is what Her Highness
the grand duchess really d

1792
01:36:20,564 --> 01:36:26,764
Why, then, I must be pleased,
but for myself, no, I a

1793
01:36:26,938 --> 01:36:28,633
We should not only
have given you that title,

1794
01:36:28,806 --> 01:36:31,138
We should have made you an ambassador.

1795
01:36:31,309 --> 01:36:34,540
How deviously you have arrived
at what you wanted to

1796
01:36:34,712 --> 01:36:36,577
And even now, you don't say it.

1797
01:36:36,747 --> 01:36:38,544
You have not given me
even a piece of string

1798
01:36:38,716 --> 01:36:41,685
To hang you with.

1799
01:36:41,852 --> 01:36:44,377
Sergei Pavlovich,
what do you wish to ask?

1800
01:36:44,555 --> 01:36:47,524
Why do you try to ask me?
Why have you not asked her?

1801
01:36:47,692 --> 01:36:50,126
Often what is difficult for others
is simple for me,

1802
01:36:50,294 --> 01:36:52,319
But what has always been
the simplest for others

1803
01:36:52,496 --> 01:36:54,123
Is impossible for me.

1804
01:36:54,298 --> 01:36:55,822
I made the attempt, Your Majesty,

1805
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,298
But it became translated into anger.

1806
01:36:58,469 --> 01:37:01,302
You are less of a knave than I thought,

1807
01:37:01,472 --> 01:37:04,202
But very much more of a fool.

1808
01:37:04,375 --> 01:37:06,400
Yes?

1809
01:37:06,577 --> 01:37:08,477
Excuse me, Your Majesty. It's time.

1810
01:37:08,646 --> 01:37:11,114
So soon?

1811
01:37:11,282 --> 01:37:14,410
Boynin, I want you to wait for me here.

1812
01:37:14,585 --> 01:37:17,247
This time, it is a command.

1813
01:37:17,421 --> 01:37:18,911
Will you?

1814
01:37:19,090 --> 01:37:25,086
Yes, Your Majesty, I will.

1815
01:37:26,063 --> 01:37:29,294
Your Majesty, I cannot wait for you
to look down into

1816
01:37:29,467 --> 01:37:31,196
You'll weep absolute tears.

1817
01:37:31,369 --> 01:37:34,031
Everyone's there,
and the gowns and the uniforms.

1818
01:37:34,205 --> 01:37:36,070
It's incredibly like it used to be.

1819
01:37:36,240 --> 01:37:38,367
Yes. I can smell the mothballs.

1820
01:37:38,542 --> 01:37:40,703
Your Imperial Majesty, I beg you...

1821
01:37:40,878 --> 01:37:41,867
Mmm... Excuse me.

1822
01:37:42,046 --> 01:37:45,345
If Your Majesty will permit me
to explain the ceremon

1823
01:37:45,516 --> 01:37:48,178
Lievenbaum.
We discussed the ceremony this morning.

1824
01:37:48,352 --> 01:37:50,820
Yes, but...
The "but" we'll discuss later.

1825
01:37:50,988 --> 01:37:53,980
Yes, baroness.

1826
01:37:58,896 --> 01:38:01,296
How lovely you are.

1827
01:38:01,465 --> 01:38:03,558
Are you having a good time?
Yes, grandmama.

1828
01:38:03,734 --> 01:38:04,200
Where is Paul?

1829
01:38:04,368 --> 01:38:06,029
He's dancing with
the princess of Falkanburg.

1830
01:38:06,203 --> 01:38:08,501
He dances very well.
Yes, very well.

1831
01:38:08,672 --> 01:38:11,266
And he's very handsome.
Yes, he's handsome.

1832
01:38:11,442 --> 01:38:14,934
Your Majesty, a thousand apologies...

1833
01:38:15,112 --> 01:38:16,443
If they have waited 10 years,

1834
01:38:16,614 --> 01:38:18,946
They should not mind
waiting 10 minutes more.

1835
01:38:19,116 --> 01:38:22,313
Lievenbaum, I want to speak to
my granddaughter alone

1836
01:38:22,486 --> 01:38:24,920
Out, gentlemen. Out.

1837
01:38:25,089 --> 01:38:27,557
Where is Boynin?
It's just like him to disappear

1838
01:38:27,725 --> 01:38:31,525
When he is really needed.
All right, ladies, count.

1839
01:38:31,695 --> 01:38:35,426
Lievenbaum, that gentleman
you are so fond of,

1840
01:38:35,599 --> 01:38:36,998
See that he does not
leave the green room.

1841
01:38:37,168 --> 01:38:41,161
Yes, Your Majesty.

1842
01:38:47,211 --> 01:38:49,270
They're whirling in delight down there.

1843
01:38:49,447 --> 01:38:51,642
Yes.

1844
01:38:51,816 --> 01:38:52,874
Come here.

1845
01:38:53,050 --> 01:38:55,018
Let me put it on for you.

1846
01:38:55,186 --> 01:38:56,847
Are you that tired of it already?

1847
01:38:57,021 --> 01:38:58,511
It's just that I'm not used to one.

1848
01:38:58,689 --> 01:39:00,657
It takes time.

1849
01:39:00,825 --> 01:39:03,726
Are you sure about Paul?

1850
01:39:03,894 --> 01:39:06,590
Why...

1851
01:39:06,764 --> 01:39:08,595
I-I like him very much.

1852
01:39:08,766 --> 01:39:10,358
Why do you stammer?

1853
01:39:10,534 --> 01:39:12,900
I was surprised
by the suddenness of the question.

1854
01:39:13,070 --> 01:39:15,129
If you love, the answer is always ready.

1855
01:39:15,306 --> 01:39:16,898
I've been asked to announce
your engagement tonight.

1856
01:39:17,074 --> 01:39:20,066
Are you sure you want me to?
I want to marry.

1857
01:39:20,244 --> 01:39:21,541
Why?

1858
01:39:21,712 --> 01:39:25,546
I suppose I want the belonging,
the closeness.

1859
01:39:25,716 --> 01:39:28,617
Am I selfish?
No. Do you want all this with Paul?

1860
01:39:28,786 --> 01:39:30,617
I think it would please you, grandmama,

1861
01:39:30,788 --> 01:39:33,154
And anything that would please
you would please me.

1862
01:39:33,324 --> 01:39:35,622
Do you know you're talking
exactly like Boynin?

1863
01:39:35,793 --> 01:39:38,455
Oh, no.
Oh, yes.

1864
01:39:38,629 --> 01:39:43,589
Anastasia Nikolayevna,
you don't really want to marry

1865
01:39:43,767 --> 01:39:46,258
I don't know.
You do know,

1866
01:39:46,437 --> 01:39:49,964
Because you really want someone else.

1867
01:39:50,141 --> 01:39:53,599
Do I?
Maybe.

1868
01:39:53,777 --> 01:39:55,540
Except that all this time,

1869
01:39:55,713 --> 01:39:58,546
The only thing I thought
I really wanted was you.

1870
01:39:58,716 --> 01:40:01,241
That you already have,
and it's not enough,

1871
01:40:01,418 --> 01:40:03,045
Nor should it be.

1872
01:40:03,220 --> 01:40:06,018
No one can blame me for living
with my dear phantoms,

1873
01:40:06,190 --> 01:40:08,784
But you, you must find the things

1874
01:40:08,959 --> 01:40:10,984
From which other women
make their happiness.

1875
01:40:11,162 --> 01:40:17,067
Sit here for just one moment longer.

1876
01:40:17,234 --> 01:40:19,862
Lievenbaum says things
are just as they used to be

1877
01:40:20,037 --> 01:40:21,026
Down in the ballroom.

1878
01:40:21,205 --> 01:40:22,331
She's foolish.

1879
01:40:22,506 --> 01:40:25,498
The world moves on, Malenkaya,
and we must move on wi

1880
01:40:25,676 --> 01:40:27,701
Or be left to molder with the past.

1881
01:40:27,878 --> 01:40:29,937
I am the past. I like it.

1882
01:40:30,114 --> 01:40:35,416
It's sweet and familiar,
and the present is cold and

1883
01:40:35,586 --> 01:40:37,554
And the future...

1884
01:40:37,721 --> 01:40:39,518
Unfortunately, I don't need to concern

1885
01:40:39,690 --> 01:40:41,988
Myself with that, but you do.

1886
01:40:42,159 --> 01:40:45,151
It's yours.

1887
01:40:45,596 --> 01:40:47,359
Unfasten this for me, will you, please?

1888
01:40:47,531 --> 01:40:50,125
Figgy's emeralds?
Yes. I want to give them to you.

1889
01:40:50,301 --> 01:40:52,166
Grandmama, you have given me

1890
01:40:52,336 --> 01:40:54,395
What no one else in the world could...

1891
01:40:54,572 --> 01:40:56,039
Myself.

1892
01:40:56,207 --> 01:40:59,199
Thank you.

1893
01:41:10,054 --> 01:41:12,887
Here. Here.
You'd better fix it yourself.

1894
01:41:13,057 --> 01:41:14,490
Go into the green room.

1895
01:41:14,658 --> 01:41:16,091
Lievenbaum will help you.

1896
01:41:16,260 --> 01:41:18,524
Yes, grandmama.

1897
01:41:18,696 --> 01:41:24,692
Hurry. There's not much time.

1898
01:41:44,088 --> 01:41:48,149
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

1899
01:41:48,325 --> 01:41:52,318
Yes? What is it?

1900
01:41:52,930 --> 01:41:54,090
I thought you'd like to know

1901
01:41:54,265 --> 01:41:56,733
That the gentleman
no longer waits alone.

1902
01:41:56,900 --> 01:41:58,629
Good.

1903
01:41:58,802 --> 01:42:01,635
I suppose we shall have to
go on with the performance

1904
01:42:01,805 --> 01:42:03,272
Bring in the jesters.

1905
01:42:03,440 --> 01:42:05,635
Yes, Your Majesty.

1906
01:42:05,809 --> 01:42:07,299
Ladies and gentlemen.

1907
01:42:07,478 --> 01:42:08,843
Baroness.

1908
01:42:09,013 --> 01:42:10,446
Oh, Your Majesty, I beg you.

1909
01:42:10,614 --> 01:42:12,013
We cannot keep them waiting any longer.

1910
01:42:12,182 --> 01:42:15,777
May we proceed now?
Yes, yes, proceed.

1911
01:42:15,953 --> 01:42:17,921
Oh, uhh... The musicians?

1912
01:42:18,088 --> 01:42:20,147
All arranged, sir.
Good.

1913
01:42:20,324 --> 01:42:22,986
Take your position by the curtains.
Yes, sir.

1914
01:42:23,160 --> 01:42:25,492
And straighten your tie.

1915
01:42:25,663 --> 01:42:27,187
And, your Excellency,
please, don't forget,

1916
01:42:27,364 --> 01:42:29,594
All the names loud, strong, clear.

1917
01:42:29,767 --> 01:42:32,531
Don't worry.
Oh, thank you, your Excellency.

1918
01:42:32,703 --> 01:42:33,965
Ladies, get ready.

1919
01:42:34,138 --> 01:42:36,629
Where is, uhh...

1920
01:42:36,807 --> 01:42:39,139
Where is Prince Paul?
I've told you twice. He's comin

1921
01:42:39,310 --> 01:42:41,301
And three times you've told me
You cannot find Boynin

1922
01:42:41,478 --> 01:42:44,675
I also told you that he said...
To go ahead without h

1923
01:42:44,848 --> 01:42:47,749
I say there is something
unbalanced with him tonight,

1924
01:42:47,918 --> 01:42:49,442
And the sooner we...

1925
01:42:49,620 --> 01:42:51,645
Oh, your Highness.

1926
01:42:51,822 --> 01:42:54,814
Your Majesty.

1927
01:42:55,225 --> 01:42:56,886
I've never seen
you look like this before.

1928
01:42:57,061 --> 01:42:59,962
I have never felt like this before.

1929
01:43:00,130 --> 01:43:02,064
It is time.
Petrovin, would you be so kind

1930
01:43:02,232 --> 01:43:04,757
As to inform Her Imperial Highness,
the Grand Duchess

1931
01:43:04,935 --> 01:43:06,334
That we are ready?
Right away.

1932
01:43:06,503 --> 01:43:09,904
Hurry.
Baroness, the procedure,

1933
01:43:10,074 --> 01:43:11,473
Just to refresh your memory

1934
01:43:11,642 --> 01:43:12,973
As to what we discussed this morning.

1935
01:43:13,143 --> 01:43:15,304
You think my mind is failing?

1936
01:43:15,479 --> 01:43:18,676
Ha ha ha! Baron...

1937
01:43:18,849 --> 01:43:23,616
Ladies and gentlemen,
there will be a... drum roll.

1938
01:43:23,787 --> 01:43:25,550
After that, Her Imperial Majesty,

1939
01:43:25,723 --> 01:43:27,657
The Dowager Empress, will come forward,

1940
01:43:27,825 --> 01:43:30,316
And when she passes
through the curtains...

1941
01:43:30,494 --> 01:43:33,224
The orchestra will strike up
our national anthem.

1942
01:43:33,397 --> 01:43:36,332
After that, the grand duchess is...
She has gone!

1943
01:43:36,500 --> 01:43:38,365
Gone where? What is he talking about?

1944
01:43:38,535 --> 01:43:40,127
She's not there. I looked all over.

1945
01:43:40,304 --> 01:43:42,033
That is impossible.
I mean, she must be...

1946
01:43:42,206 --> 01:43:45,039
Silence.
You have looked in the green room?

1947
01:43:45,209 --> 01:43:47,404
Yes, Your Majesty.
There is no one there.

1948
01:43:47,578 --> 01:43:50,138
No one.
Perhaps she went to her room.

1949
01:43:50,314 --> 01:43:52,179
You won't find her.
It's a waste of time.

1950
01:43:52,349 --> 01:43:54,214
They've both gone.
Both?

1951
01:43:54,385 --> 01:43:56,649
She and your friend Boynin.

1952
01:43:56,820 --> 01:43:58,014
But why? I don't understand.

1953
01:43:58,188 --> 01:44:01,521
You never did.
You mean the others were right?

1954
01:44:01,692 --> 01:44:03,660
She was not Anastasia after all.

1955
01:44:03,827 --> 01:44:05,818
Wasn't she?
Your Majesty, I beg you.

1956
01:44:05,996 --> 01:44:06,928
They're all waiting down there.

1957
01:44:07,097 --> 01:44:09,224
What can we say to them?

1958
01:44:09,400 --> 01:44:11,834
Nothing.
Paul, your arm.

1959
01:44:12,002 --> 01:44:13,697
I will speak to them.

1960
01:44:13,871 --> 01:44:15,202
Oh, thank you, Your Majesty.

1961
01:44:15,372 --> 01:44:19,365
Everybody, please.

1962
01:44:19,710 --> 01:44:22,270
Forgive me, Aunt Maria,
but what will you say?

1963
01:44:22,446 --> 01:44:26,940
Say?
Oh, I will say, "the play is over.

1964
01:44:27,284 --> 01:44:30,276
Go home."
