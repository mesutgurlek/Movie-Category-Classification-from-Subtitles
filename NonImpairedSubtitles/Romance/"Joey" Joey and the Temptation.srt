1
00:00:01,251 --> 00:00:01,835
Guys, guys...

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:03,212
Oh, good, you're up. You can settle this.

3
00:00:03,337 --> 00:00:05,214
Which one of us is the bigger pain in the ass?

4
00:00:05,297 --> 00:00:07,049
Gina, I don't have time for this. I have a big problem.

5
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:08,383
Just pick one.

6
00:00:08,425 --> 00:00:10,636
Fine-- Gina, you are the bigger pain in the ass.

7
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:11,845
Told you!

8
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:14,348
Okay, can you listen to me, please?

9
00:00:14,473 --> 00:00:17,267
Okay, you remember how Alex was upstairs spying on her husband from my bedroom?

10
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:20,145
Well, when she fell asleep, I saw him kissing another woman.

11
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:21,020
Oh, my God.

12
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:24,600
I know, and she has no idea. She's up there sleeping like an angel.

13
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:26,900
And drooling like a bull mastiff.

14
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:30,155
So, what are you going to do? You going to tell her?

15
00:00:30,197 --> 00:00:31,490
I don't know.

16
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:33,116
Well, I can tell you from personal experience,

17
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:35,202
you get news like that, you end up stabbing the messenger.

18
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,204
I think the saying is "shoot the messenger."

19
00:00:37,788 --> 00:00:38,539
What saying?

20
00:00:39,957 --> 00:00:41,124
You know what? I think you're right.

21
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:43,836
She shouldn't hear this from me. Eric should be the one to tell her.

22
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:45,504
I think I'm gonna go have a little chat with him.

23
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:46,588
Whoa, you think he's gonna listen to you?

24
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:48,841
Oh, yeah, he's pretty scared of me. He thinks we're in the Mafia.

25
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:50,926
Why, just 'cause we're Italian?

26
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:52,886
No, 'cause your mother told him we were.

27
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,306
Well, I think it makes us more colorful.

28
00:01:36,972 --> 00:01:38,849
Hey, Eric, can I talk to you for a second?

29
00:01:39,016 --> 00:01:41,143
Uh, sure. Yeah. Come on in.

30
00:01:41,185 --> 00:01:41,518
Thanks.

31
00:01:44,897 --> 00:01:48,108
Okay, look, I saw something last night that I don't think I was supposed to see.

32
00:01:48,192 --> 00:01:49,735
Oh, my God! Was there a hit?

33
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:51,778
What? Uh, is somebody sleeping with the fishes?

34
00:01:53,322 --> 00:01:54,656
I am not in the Mafia!

35
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,742
Right. Right. Yeah.

36
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:58,202
The Feds.

37
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:00,412
Eric, Eric, Eric.

38
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:03,373
I saw you kissing that woman last night.

39
00:02:04,917 --> 00:02:08,253
What? Um, look, no, it's not what it looks like.

40
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:11,048
Look, I know the excuses, okay? I've used them all.

41
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,133
She's an old friend. She's my sister.

42
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,344
She had peanut butter in her mouth and I was starving.

43
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:20,766
Okay. Um, does Alex know?

44
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:22,518
No. I didn't tell her.

45
00:02:22,601 --> 00:02:24,019
Oh, thank God. Thank you.

46
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:25,729
Because I think she should hear it from you.

47
00:02:28,941 --> 00:02:29,566
You're right.

48
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:31,652
You're right, I'll tell her.

49
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,196
Look, but things are pretty raw right now,

50
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:35,822
and we're kind of on shaky ground.

51
00:02:36,448 --> 00:02:37,866
So, just let me find the right time.

52
00:02:40,077 --> 00:02:41,703
Fine. But don't wait too long,

53
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:43,330
otherwise I'm gonna have to come back and see you.

54
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:44,498
Oh, my God.

55
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:45,749
With some of your...

56
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:47,334
"associates"?

57
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:51,421
That's right.

58
00:03:02,224 --> 00:03:03,183
- Hey.
- Hey.

59
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:04,685
What are you doing?

60
00:03:05,561 --> 00:03:08,188
Well, this whole thing with Alex and Eric has got me thinking, you know.

61
00:03:08,397 --> 00:03:10,315
Things are going so great with me and Sara that

62
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:12,442
I don't want to mess up and sleep with someone else.

63
00:03:12,568 --> 00:03:13,527
So, you know what I'm going to do?

64
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:15,904
Become a different person?

65
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:19,950
No, no, I'm calling all the girls I used to go out with

66
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:21,994
and letting them know that I am now unavailable.

67
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:24,079
All right, let's see, who's next?

68
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:25,163
Joey...

69
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:29,168
you really think you're going to be able to give up other women?

70
00:03:29,293 --> 00:03:30,961
Yeah. I think it's time.

71
00:03:31,295 --> 00:03:33,046
I mean, I've had my fair share of women.

72
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,757
I've had at least one from every country, except for Iceland.

73
00:03:36,008 --> 00:03:39,261
Really? That's the only kind of girl you've never been with?

74
00:03:39,428 --> 00:03:41,013
Yup. Thought I had one once.

75
00:03:41,138 --> 00:03:43,807
I spent the whole weekend with her. Turned out she was a Dane.

76
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:47,978
- Hey.
- Hey.

77
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:50,856
- Hi.
- Hi, Michael.

78
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:55,277
Wow, you Tribbianis must have an amazing gene pool,

79
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:57,029
'cause you are one good-looking family.

80
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:58,363
Whoa.

81
00:04:04,036 --> 00:04:04,661
Whoo!

82
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:07,998
Yeah, don't compliment him. It gets him confused.

83
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:12,711
What's this list of women's names?

84
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:14,379
Oh, I'm clearing the decks--

85
00:04:14,505 --> 00:04:17,007
letting them all know that I am off the market.

86
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:17,633
Oh.

87
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:20,010
Yeah, that's a really great idea.

88
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:22,054
I think I'll call all my old flames.

89
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,931
- Mmm, let 'em down easy.
- I will.

90
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:27,100
It's convenient, 'cause all the Tennessee Titans are at training camp.

91
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:31,647
- What?!
- I'm kidding.

92
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:34,858
All right, I should go.

93
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,027
- Yeah, you should go.
- Yeah, I should go.

94
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:38,070
- Good-bye.
- Bye.

95
00:04:45,077 --> 00:04:48,121
Michael, you mind giving us a little privacy?

96
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:49,164
Okay.

97
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:53,961
You know, I'm going to do this someday, 'cause I'm handsome.

98
00:05:04,555 --> 00:05:06,139
Hello, I'm off the market.

99
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:07,516
I'm in a committed relationship now.

100
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,102
Joey,  it's Bobbie.

101
00:05:10,394 --> 00:05:12,688
Oh, hey, Bobbie, I was just, uh...

102
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:14,022
Oh, honey, I don't care what you were doing.

103
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:16,692
As long as you're off the steroids,

104
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,485
I don't need to know your business.

105
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:22,364
Uh, I was never on steroids.

106
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:26,618
Oh, sure, a forehead just grows that way on its own.

107
00:05:29,288 --> 00:05:30,497
Anyway, great news.

108
00:05:30,956 --> 00:05:32,040
Deep Powder just called,

109
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:34,418
and they want you to come in early for body makeup.

110
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:36,920
You  have a big love scene today.

111
00:05:38,172 --> 00:05:41,091
Really? I wish I didn't have to.

112
00:05:41,425 --> 00:05:43,218
It'll be great. It's with Carmen Electra.

113
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:48,473
Hello?

114
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:50,851
Hello? Hello?

115
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:54,813
Joey.

116
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:57,482
Joey.

117
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,276
I'm in big trouble.

118
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:04,406
I'm trying to be good, and now I have to do a love scene with Carmen Electra.

119
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:06,992
So what? You're... You'll be acting, right?

120
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:09,494
It's not like you'll be in an actual romantic situation with her. It's...

121
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:16,460
Oh, Michael... Michael... you regular people are so naive.

122
00:06:18,212 --> 00:06:21,423
I have been in 75 love scenes in my career.

123
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:24,134
Now, do you know how many times that's led to actual sex?

124
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:26,595
- 75?
- 244.

125
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:33,810
Hey.

126
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:35,229
Hey.

127
00:06:35,354 --> 00:06:36,688
So, did you talk to Eric?

128
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:38,398
Yeah, yeah, he's going to tell Alex,

129
00:06:38,482 --> 00:06:40,234
but he wants to wait till the right time.

130
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:41,777
Well, he better be nice to Shirley.

131
00:06:42,778 --> 00:06:45,280
I think of her as Shirley to my Laverne.

132
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:50,452
Hello.

133
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:52,538
Oh, Sharon, thanks for calling me back.

134
00:06:52,955 --> 00:06:55,624
Yeah, are the rest of the Hawaiian Tropic girls there?

135
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:57,376
Great, can you put me on speakerphone?

136
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:00,921
Okay, bad news, ladies.

137
00:07:03,799 --> 00:07:04,758
Hey.

138
00:07:05,843 --> 00:07:06,927
I just talked to Eric.

139
00:07:07,261 --> 00:07:09,096
Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.

140
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,267
Yeah, we're separated, and he still wants me to call his mother for her birthday?!

141
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:15,853
I don't want to call her! That woman does not like me.

142
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:18,897
The first time I met her, she looked at my chest and said, "What's going on there?"

143
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:22,651
- Is that all you talked about?
- Yeah.

144
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:24,730
I just, I can't believe him.

145
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:25,570
Who?

146
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:26,820
Eric.

147
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:29,199
I just had this really intense conversation with him.

148
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:32,160
Oh, he told me he was going to talk to you. Are you okay?

149
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:33,996
Joey, can I see you outside for a second?

150
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:35,122
Gina...

151
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:36,874
Alex is going through something right now.

152
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,417
Could you be a little sensitive?

153
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:39,543
Joey! On the patio! Now!

154
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:47,593
Boy, it's always about Gina!

155
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,181
I'm sorry. Go ahead, sweetie. Here... sit down.

156
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:56,393
Well, I'm just so mad, you know.

157
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,604
I mean, I know this is gonna sound harsh, but I hate that woman.

158
00:07:59,563 --> 00:08:02,232
Alex, Eric has some responsibility in this, too.

159
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:04,318
Yeah, I guess.

160
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:05,527
You guess?

161
00:08:05,611 --> 00:08:07,404
C'mon! He made out with her!

162
00:08:10,741 --> 00:08:12,367
Eric made out with his mother?

163
00:08:15,454 --> 00:08:16,079
What?!

164
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:22,085
First he's kissing that other woman, now he's making out with his mother?!

165
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:23,962
Hold it together, dude!

166
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:27,716
Joey, don't say anything!

167
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:34,806
He... he made out with her?

168
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:39,520
Yeah. I'm so sorry, Alex.

169
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:41,396
Me, too.

170
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:44,024
I can't believe this.

171
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:45,984
I know.

172
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:46,944
Hey...

173
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:51,448
A little heads-up would have been nice.

174
00:08:58,956 --> 00:09:02,876
How could Eric do this? Aw, geez, Luigi, this is bad.

175
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:05,754
"Geez, Luigi"?!

176
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:07,506
What happened?

177
00:09:07,631 --> 00:09:09,758
I mean, was it just a kiss, or did they actually...?

178
00:09:09,842 --> 00:09:11,468
I-I don't know the details, okay?

179
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:13,971
That's why I felt it was important that Eric be the one to tell you.

180
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:15,347
But this was good, too.

181
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:19,935
We got separated so that we could work on the marriage.

182
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:21,562
And now he's off with another woman?!

183
00:09:21,645 --> 00:09:23,021
I mean, I know I was spying on him,

184
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:25,190
but I never really thought he would do anything.

185
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:28,569
How am I going to forgive him for this?

186
00:09:28,694 --> 00:09:30,237
Are you definitely going to forgive him?

187
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,447
Yeah. What else am I supposed to do?

188
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:33,699
Get mad!

189
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:36,869
Alex, this is a big deal. And this is not your only problem.

190
00:09:37,119 --> 00:09:40,038
He's always on tour. When he is in town, you barely connect.

191
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:41,290
You don't have a passionate sex life.

192
00:09:41,373 --> 00:09:43,959
Gina! Don't talk about my "S" life!

193
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:49,840
And now, you're separated for one day, and he's with someone else?!

194
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:53,010
And you're just going to accept this? You deserve better.

195
00:09:53,302 --> 00:09:57,306
Okay, you're right. I'll talk to him.

196
00:09:57,848 --> 00:09:59,391
Not talk to him-- yell at him.

197
00:09:59,892 --> 00:10:00,726
I'm not much of a yeller.

198
00:10:00,976 --> 00:10:03,020
Oh, then take Gina with you, she yells all the time.

199
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:07,441
You know, it might actually be good to have you there.

200
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:09,651
I  mean, you know, as moral support.

201
00:10:09,735 --> 00:10:11,945
That way, if I start to cave, you won't let me.

202
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:13,280
It's inappropriate.

203
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,199
It's almost certainly going to make things worse. I'll do it.

204
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:22,497
So... I just finished reading your scenes with Carmen Electra.

205
00:10:22,873 --> 00:10:24,708
Yeah. They're pretty intense.

206
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:26,293
Get ready to blush.

207
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:28,629
I think I'll be okay.

208
00:10:33,425 --> 00:10:34,927
Geez, Luigi!

209
00:10:37,513 --> 00:10:39,765
- Oh, man, this is bad.
- Yeah.

210
00:10:40,015 --> 00:10:41,934
And it's Carmen Electra.

211
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:45,854
You put the two of us together in a love scene and it's a sexual time bomb.

212
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:49,483
Okay, okay, I need something to defuse it.

213
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:53,362
Something that's such a turn-off it'll de-sexualize any situation.

214
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:56,615
I need a living, breathing cold shower.

215
00:10:59,243 --> 00:11:01,161
Hey buddy, you want to meet Carmen Electra?

216
00:11:02,663 --> 00:11:04,748
- Sure!
- Okay, come on.

217
00:11:09,086 --> 00:11:09,962
Eric?

218
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:14,633
Eric?

219
00:11:17,052 --> 00:11:18,762
I guess he's not home.

220
00:11:19,847 --> 00:11:22,683
God, I can't believe he was in this room kissing another woman.

221
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:25,018
I'm just so angry, I could break something.

222
00:11:25,102 --> 00:11:27,396
Do it. What's the most important thing he owns?

223
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:30,941
Well, his viola. But we can't break that. It means too much to him.

224
00:11:31,066 --> 00:11:32,734
Okay, even better.

225
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:36,238
All we're going to do is take it...

226
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,490
and put it in the middle of the room.

227
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:41,368
And he'll see all the other stuff we messed with,

228
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:44,746
and he'll always wonder, "What did they do to my viola?"

229
00:11:46,081 --> 00:11:47,291
Oh...

230
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,960
That will really fudge with his head.

231
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:53,755
I once did it to an ex-boyfriend of mine.

232
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:55,257
Oh, did he play an instrument?

233
00:11:55,883 --> 00:11:57,384
No. It was a pound of hash.

234
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:08,937
Oh, God, there she is. There's Carmen Electra.

235
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:12,399
Here she comes. Okay, do not leave my side.

236
00:12:12,524 --> 00:12:14,401
Okay, look... Be strong. Remember Sara.

237
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:16,403
Okay? You cannot leave her. She thinks I'm good-looking.

238
00:12:17,112 --> 00:12:18,906
- Hey, Joey.
- Hey.

239
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:20,866
I'm really excited we're working together.

240
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:25,120
You know, I'm a huge Days of Our Lives fan. I love Drake Ramoray.

241
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:28,207
Well, thanks. Yeah. Oh, hey, this is my nephew, Michael.

242
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,750
- Hi.
- Hi. I'm Carmen.

243
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:32,920
Uh, your collar's a little up in the back.

244
00:12:34,713 --> 00:12:36,381
- There you go.
- Thanks.

245
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:39,635
Please have sex with her.

246
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:42,971
- Michael...
- I'm sorry.

247
00:12:43,055 --> 00:12:44,431
Look, you have a big problem here.

248
00:12:44,473 --> 00:12:45,224
Joey!

249
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:47,601
I came down to watch your big scene.

250
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:49,061
Oh, hey, hey.

251
00:12:49,728 --> 00:12:51,563
- Oh, and you.
- Yeah.

252
00:12:51,647 --> 00:12:53,065
Aw, gimme, gimme.

253
00:12:57,611 --> 00:12:59,071
Oh, what are you doing here?

254
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:02,241
He's here to stop me from jumping into bed with Carmen Electra.

255
00:13:02,866 --> 00:13:05,661
Oh, really? Well, who's stopping him from jumping in bed with me?

256
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:11,834
Why'd you scare him off? He was my buffer.

257
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:14,211
Well, why don't you want anything to happen with Carmen Electra?

258
00:13:14,628 --> 00:13:17,422
She's the only woman I would sleep with...

259
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:19,842
or so I thought until last Saturday.

260
00:13:25,389 --> 00:13:26,849
Sweet. Yeah... Okay, look, I'm just...

261
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:29,935
I'm worried because I just started in a committed relationship.

262
00:13:30,102 --> 00:13:32,062
- You did what?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

263
00:13:32,187 --> 00:13:33,397
We're being exclusive, and I...

264
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:36,859
- Exclusive?!
- Yeah, yeah.

265
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,152
So if you could just get them to rewrite the script a little bit,

266
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:40,195
that would be great.

267
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:41,572
Oh, sure.

268
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:44,658
Yeah, we'll alert all writers and directors--

269
00:13:44,992 --> 00:13:47,744
Joey Tribbiani is in a relationship.

270
00:13:48,203 --> 00:13:49,913
Let's stop Hollywood.

271
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:55,627
Exclusive! You big jackass!

272
00:13:58,547 --> 00:14:01,508
Joey, we're going to run through your scene with Carmen before we shoot it.

273
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:06,346
All right, let's take it from the top.

274
00:14:07,306 --> 00:14:09,558
Thank you, Jeremiah. Because of your hard work,

275
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:11,643
I just won four more years in the U.S. Senate.

276
00:14:12,144 --> 00:14:13,979
Isn't a Senate term six years?

277
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:15,981
Please, read the line as written.

278
00:14:19,651 --> 00:14:22,112
Well, the U.S. Senate has been a great friend to Powder Mountain.

279
00:14:22,446 --> 00:14:26,158
We'd like to be more than friends.

280
00:14:26,658 --> 00:14:29,328
You know, here might be a good time for the Senator to take her jacket off.

281
00:14:29,912 --> 00:14:31,788
- Oh.
- Take her jacket off?

282
00:14:32,873 --> 00:14:34,416
Okay, it's no big deal. No big deal.

283
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,752
That is just ridiculous.

284
00:14:42,716 --> 00:14:44,384
And now Carmen moves in really close.

285
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:54,061
Uh, could we take a break? I-I-I forgot my line here.

286
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:57,147
The script just says "ad-lib heavy breathing."

287
00:15:01,235 --> 00:15:02,069
Man, that's good writing.

288
00:15:06,073 --> 00:15:08,200
Okay, can you guys hold that position while we adjust the cameras?

289
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:09,743
Great.

290
00:15:11,036 --> 00:15:14,957
Wow, I am really feeling the heat. You are a great actress.

291
00:15:15,874 --> 00:15:16,542
I'm not acting.

292
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:18,752
We're going to have sex today.

293
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:23,632
245...

294
00:15:33,809 --> 00:15:35,561
Get me, I'm Annie Hall.

295
00:15:36,395 --> 00:15:39,982
Okay, so guess what, I broke a framed picture of his mother,

296
00:15:40,107 --> 00:15:43,819
I changed all the clocks to be ten minutes slow so he'll always be late

297
00:15:44,069 --> 00:15:46,697
and then I made it so that his TiVo will only record wrestling.

298
00:15:47,239 --> 00:15:48,156
Ooh, that's good.

299
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,868
Do a bunch of mean things and then one nice thing to throw him off.

300
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:54,580
God,  this place is a mess. Have we gone too far?

301
00:15:54,913 --> 00:15:56,915
Don't soften. I need you to be strong.

302
00:15:56,957 --> 00:15:59,168
We're going to get through this together. Right?

303
00:16:00,752 --> 00:16:02,296
What the hell, is...?

304
00:16:05,215 --> 00:16:06,508
Oh, my God.

305
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:08,677
You know.

306
00:16:09,928 --> 00:16:10,554
Yeah.

307
00:16:11,388 --> 00:16:13,849
What did you do to my viola?

308
00:16:19,146 --> 00:16:22,566
Alex, I am so sorry.

309
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:26,195
I feel badly about what I did. It was a terrible mistake.

310
00:16:26,528 --> 00:16:28,238
And if I could take it back I would.

311
00:16:29,072 --> 00:16:29,656
But...

312
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:33,911
all I can do is say that I am very, very sorry.

313
00:16:37,164 --> 00:16:39,082
Well... that's something.

314
00:16:41,043 --> 00:16:41,627
Well, it is something.

315
00:16:43,921 --> 00:16:45,297
Could you at least stop cutting those?

316
00:16:45,631 --> 00:16:46,089
No.

317
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:53,305
Look, Alex, you have to try and look at this from my perspective, you know.

318
00:16:53,472 --> 00:16:55,557
I mean, you wanted the separation.

319
00:16:55,891 --> 00:16:57,017
You forced me into it.

320
00:16:57,309 --> 00:16:59,603
Wha... what are you saying?

321
00:17:00,604 --> 00:17:02,814
Look, what I did was wrong, you know,

322
00:17:03,148 --> 00:17:06,276
but you have to take some responsibility here, honey.

323
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:08,362
It's kind of your fault, too.

324
00:17:13,742 --> 00:17:15,160
Gina, you can go.

325
00:17:15,911 --> 00:17:18,372
- You sure?
- Yeah, I got this.

326
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:23,252
Um, excuse me, I think that's my wine.

327
00:17:23,669 --> 00:17:26,338
Yes, but you gave it to me as a sign of respect.

328
00:17:27,798 --> 00:17:28,298
Enjoy.

329
00:17:32,469 --> 00:17:33,846
You turned down Carmen Electra.

330
00:17:34,346 --> 00:17:35,639
Like, how did you do it?

331
00:17:36,223 --> 00:17:37,808
I did anything I could to distract myself.

332
00:17:38,183 --> 00:17:39,434
You know, I thought about Sara,

333
00:17:39,685 --> 00:17:40,477
I thought about baseball,

334
00:17:40,811 --> 00:17:41,687
I thought about sandwiches.

335
00:17:42,312 --> 00:17:45,023
This may not have been my best performance.

336
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:48,068
Okay, look, let's take any more chances.

337
00:17:48,402 --> 00:17:50,612
Go get the car and get me out of here.

338
00:17:50,779 --> 00:17:51,864
I won't feel safe until I get home.

339
00:17:52,447 --> 00:17:53,991
- All right, you got it.
- Okay.

340
00:18:07,629 --> 00:18:08,881
Joey Tribbiani's girlfriend.

341
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:10,966
Oh, that's nice to hear.

342
00:18:11,675 --> 00:18:14,970
Look, I just called because I wanted to hear your voice.

343
00:18:15,304 --> 00:18:22,144
And also, I want you to know that I would never do anything to...

344
00:18:22,269 --> 00:18:23,312
I'm going to have to call you back.

345
00:18:26,315 --> 00:18:27,983
- Hi, Joey.
- Wow.

346
00:18:29,193 --> 00:18:30,861
What are you doing here?

347
00:18:31,028 --> 00:18:33,071
I didn't have a shower in my dressing room,

348
00:18:33,405 --> 00:18:35,324
and I thought you might want to see me naked.

349
00:18:38,577 --> 00:18:39,703
Wow, you're like a mind reader.

350
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:47,169
I've just had a crush on you for such a long time.

351
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:48,504
Me, too.

352
00:18:49,004 --> 00:18:51,965
I still use your 1998 Baywatch calendar 'cause it's so hot.

353
00:18:54,468 --> 00:18:56,720
I've missed Christmas for the last four years in a row,

354
00:18:56,845 --> 00:18:57,804
but it's overrated anyway.

355
00:18:59,181 --> 00:19:00,015
Then let's do this.

356
00:19:00,516 --> 00:19:02,768
But I just started a relationship.

357
00:19:03,477 --> 00:19:05,187
Then this will just be between us.

358
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,481
No one has to know.

359
00:19:08,106 --> 00:19:10,192
Honey, we're both going to want to tell people about this.

360
00:19:14,655 --> 00:19:15,155
Look, I'm sorry.

361
00:19:15,364 --> 00:19:17,199
This girl's too great for me to risk messing things up.

362
00:19:17,699 --> 00:19:19,076
I hope you'll be okay.

363
00:19:19,284 --> 00:19:22,120
Let's not get carried away. I'll be okay.

364
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:28,335
Well, it's nice to know you're a one-woman guy.

365
00:19:28,544 --> 00:19:30,128
Well, thanks.

366
00:19:30,462 --> 00:19:31,630
Didn't know I had this kind of willpower.

367
00:19:31,713 --> 00:19:35,133
I mean, if I can resist you, I can resist anything.

368
00:19:39,847 --> 00:19:42,015
- Carmy, there you are.
- Hi...

369
00:19:42,558 --> 00:19:45,811
Oh, Joey, this is my friend Elsa.

370
00:19:47,896 --> 00:19:49,064
Oh, Drake Ramoray.

371
00:19:49,648 --> 00:19:52,651
I'm a big fan. You are huge in Iceland.

372
00:19:58,907 --> 00:20:00,158
Maybe we can share him.

373
00:20:00,701 --> 00:20:01,702
Oh, come on!

374
00:20:13,589 --> 00:20:14,506
Hey. What's going on?

375
00:20:15,674 --> 00:20:16,925
I talked to Eric, and, uh...

376
00:20:18,135 --> 00:20:18,969
it's not going to work out.

377
00:20:20,012 --> 00:20:21,722
Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.

378
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:23,849
Can I get you anything, Alex?

379
00:20:24,224 --> 00:20:26,977
You know, I think I could use some of that wine you took.

380
00:20:27,936 --> 00:20:28,520
Uh...

381
00:20:29,021 --> 00:20:32,733
You drank it all?

382
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,443
Well, you were gone for like 20 minutes.

383
00:20:36,486 --> 00:20:37,321
Hey, hey, you know what?

384
00:20:38,071 --> 00:20:39,323
I was saving it for a special occasion,

385
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,575
but I've got a bottle of champagne in the fridge.

386
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:43,994
What say we pop it open and we'll toast new beginnings.

387
00:20:45,537 --> 00:20:46,288
Huh...

388
00:20:51,126 --> 00:20:52,294
If it makes you feel any better,

389
00:20:52,586 --> 00:20:55,130
I didn't sleep with Carmen Electra today.

390
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,051
It kind of does.

391
00:21:04,515 --> 00:21:09,269

392
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:12,898
So we're still on for tonight.

393
00:21:12,981 --> 00:21:15,150
Yeah. Let me go put my stuff down and we can get going.

394
00:21:16,109 --> 00:21:19,780
You don't happen to have any islandic in you, do you?

395
00:21:20,739 --> 00:21:23,033
Actually my grandfather was born in Iceland.

396
00:21:23,408 --> 00:21:24,409
Cool!

397
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:26,954
- See you!
- Okay!

398
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:33,085
I think that counts!
