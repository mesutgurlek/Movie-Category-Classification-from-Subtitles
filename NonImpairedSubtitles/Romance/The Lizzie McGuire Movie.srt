1
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:23,212
Excuse me.

2
00:00:36,236 --> 00:00:41,230
Could you tell me
how to get to the medical school?

3
00:00:44,244 --> 00:00:48,237
I'm giving a lecture in 20 minutes,
and my driver's a bit lost.

4
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:54,254
You go straight ahead,
and you make a left over the bridge.

5
00:00:54,254 --> 00:00:59,248
That's a lovely accent you have.

6
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:20,449
New Jersey?

7
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:26,466
Austria.

8
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:30,459
Austria?

9
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:37,477
Well, then...

10
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:42,482
"G'day, mate."

11
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:47,476
"Let's put another shrimp
on the barbie."

12
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:50,490
Let's not.

13
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:54,483
Who's got the Wiener schnitzel?

14
00:04:57,497 --> 00:05:01,490
Beautiful. There you go, Dolf.

15
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:06,506
There you go, buddy.
Enjoy.

16
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:09,509
Let's see.
Next we've got roast beef au jus.

17
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:12,512
Who's got the roast beef au jus?
Stella, beautiful. Bon appétit.

18
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:17,517
Walk away, go on. Go on.

19
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:19,519
Last, but not least.

20
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:24,524
Foot long! Who's got the foot long?

21
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:29,529
Very funny, Rascal.
Very funny. In your dreams.

22
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:33,522
Why haven't you dropped
those dogs off at the show?

23
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:40,529
Sir, I didn't want them
to perform on an empty stomach, sir.

24
00:05:43,543 --> 00:05:47,547
Move it!

25
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:50,550
Yes, sir. Mutt Cutts. Ten-four.

26
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:53,553
Suck me sideways.

27
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:57,557
Hello. How are you?

28
00:05:57,557 --> 00:06:02,562
I'll be out in one minute.

29
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:05,554
Why you going to the airport?
Flying somewhere?

30
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:10,570
How'd you guess?

31
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:14,574
I saw your luggage.

32
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:16,576
When I noticed the airline ticket,
I put two and two together.

33
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:20,580
Where you headed?

34
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:21,581
Aspen.

35
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:26,586
California!

36
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:30,579
Beautiful.

37
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:45,594
Name's Christmas, Lloyd Christmas.

38
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:50,610
I'm Mary Swanson.

39
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:55,604
This isn't my real job.

40
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:10,619
No?

41
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:19,628
My friend Harry and I are saving up
to open a pet store.

42
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:23,643
That's nice.

43
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:27,636
" I Got Worms."

44
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:34,643
I beg your pardon?

45
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:41,650
That's the name, "l Got Worms."
We'll specialize in selling worm farms.

46
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:48,657
You know, like ant farms.

47
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:58,667
What's the matter?

48
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:15,684
Little tense about the flight?

49
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:22,702
Something like that.

50
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:24,704
Don't worry. Statistically, you're
more likely to get killed...

51
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:29,698
going to the airport,
like in a head-on crash...

52
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:35,704
flying off a cliff. Or trapped
under a gas truck! That's the worst.

53
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:47,727
I have this cousin,
well, I had this cousin...

54
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:51,720
Could you keep your eyes
on the road, please?

55
00:08:56,736 --> 00:08:59,739
Oh, yeah.

56
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:01,741
Good thinking.

57
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:06,746
Can't be too careful.

58
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:08,748
Lot of bad drivers out there.

59
00:09:08,748 --> 00:09:13,753
Okay, gang,
you know the rules:

60
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:16,756
no humping, no pushing,
no sniffing hineys.

61
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:19,759
Where were you? My dogs were supposed
to be here 40 minutes ago.

62
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:23,752
I hardly have
any time to primp them.

63
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:31,771
Don't worry, Mrs. Neugyburger.

64
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:35,775
-Neugeboren!
-Neu-neu-neug...

65
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:40,780
Boren!

66
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:45,774
These pooches won't need primping.
You know why?

67
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:51,791
Because I bathed them
and I clipped them myself.

68
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:56,785
And I stand by my performance.

69
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:07,796
On second thought, you might
want to run a comb through them.

70
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:20,809
Thanks.
Here you go.

71
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:26,826
Oh, no, Mary.

72
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:30,819
I couldn't possibly accept that.
Not after all we've been through.

73
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:34,834
Thank you, Lloyd.

74
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:36,836
Good luck with your worms.

75
00:10:36,836 --> 00:10:40,829
How about a hug?

76
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:47,847
I hate good-byes.

77
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:51,840
Just go.

78
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:06,866
Be strong.

79
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:11,871
She's gonna leave the briefcase
near the escalator.

80
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:15,864
You make the pickup.

81
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:08,928
Piece of cake.

82
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:11,931
Good-bye, my love

83
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:15,924
There's our payday.

84
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:23,932
She left it.
Let's go.

85
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:47,956
Coming through!

86
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:45,084
Move it or lose it, Sister!

87
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:49,077
Eenie...

88
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:57,096
meenie...

89
00:14:57,096 --> 00:15:01,089
minie...

90
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:09,108
mo!

91
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:14,113
Hold that plane!

92
00:15:14,113 --> 00:15:19,107
Sir, you can't go in there!

93
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:28,116
It's okay!

94
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:37,136
I'm a limo driver!

95
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:39,138
-Hi, Lloyd.
-Hi, Harry.

96
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:44,132
How was your day?

97
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:48,147
Not bad.
Fell off the jet way again.

98
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:53,141
Who do you figure
this guy's working for?

99
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:59,158
I don't know...

100
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:04,152
but we sure as hell
better find out.

101
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:09,168
The ulcer?

102
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:12,171
I'll live.

103
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:16,164
So you got fired again?

104
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:24,183
Oh, yeah.

105
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:26,185
They always freak out when you leave
the scene of an accident.

106
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:31,179
Yeah, well,
I lost my job too.

107
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:38,197
Man!

108
00:16:38,197 --> 00:16:42,190
You are one pathetic loser.

109
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:46,205
No offense.

110
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:48,207
No. None taken.

111
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:49,208
You know what really
chaffs my ass though?

112
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:54,213
I spent my life savings
turning my van into a dog.

113
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:58,206
Hi, Petey.

114
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:06,225
The alarm alone
cost me 200.

115
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:08,227
Chicks love it.

116
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:12,231
It's a shagging wagon.

117
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:17,236
What's with the briefcase?

118
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:21,229
It's a love memento.

119
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:37,256
The most beautiful woman alive.

120
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:41,260
I drove her
to the airport...

121
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:46,254
sparks flew,
emotions ran high.

122
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:53,272
She actually talked to me.

123
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:58,266
Get out of here!

124
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:04,283
Oh, yeah.

125
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:09,288
Tractor beam.

126
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:14,282
Sucked me right in.

127
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:27,306
Anyway.

128
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:30,309
She left this
in the terminal and...

129
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:34,302
flew to Aspen
and out of my life.

130
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:39,307
What's in it?

131
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:46,314
Man!

132
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:54,322
I'd have to be a lowlife to root around
in someone else's private property.

133
00:18:56,335 --> 00:19:01,340
Is it locked?

134
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:06,345
Yeah, really well.

135
00:19:06,345 --> 00:19:08,347
There's two of them.
One has a gun.

136
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:12,351
Did you pay the gas bill?

137
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:15,354
Do you realize
what you've done?

138
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:18,357
I'm sorry.
I say we bail.

139
00:19:18,357 --> 00:19:23,362
Okay.

140
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:28,356
The briefcase ain't here.
He must have taken it with him.

141
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:39,367
He's got to
come home sometime.

142
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:44,372
Maybe we should trash the place.
Send him a little message.

143
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:52,391
I don't think he's going to get
that message, Joe.

144
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:56,384
I mean the guy's got
worms in his living room.

145
00:19:58,397 --> 00:20:02,401
I got a better idea.

146
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:03,402
" I tought I taw a puddy tat.

147
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:06,405
Oh, I did. I did."
Come here.

148
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:10,409
I can't believe
we drove around all day...

149
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:11,410
and there's not a single job
in this town.

150
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:14,413
-There is nothing, nada, zip.
-Yeah.

151
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:17,416
Unless you want to work
40 hours a week.

152
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:21,409
Here.
I'm gonna go to the store.

153
00:20:24,423 --> 00:20:29,428
Just get the bare essentials.
That's the last of our dough.

154
00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:33,432
What do I look like?

155
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:36,435
Cripes!

156
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:41,429
Excuse me, little old lady?

157
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:46,445
Do you have change
of a dollar?

158
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:48,447
Change?
No, I'm sorry. I don't.

159
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:52,451
Could you do me a favor
and watch my stuff...

160
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:55,454
while I go break a dollar?

161
00:20:55,454 --> 00:21:00,459
-Of course.
-Thanks.

162
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:03,462
Hey, I guess they're right.

163
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:06,465
Senior citizens, although slow
and dangerous behind the wheel...

164
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:11,470
can still serve a purpose.

165
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:16,464
I'll be right back.
Don't you go dying on me.

166
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:24,472
Where's the booze?

167
00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:30,489
I got robbed by a sweet old lady
on a motorized cart.

168
00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:34,493
I didn't even see it coming.

169
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:38,497
Come on, Harry.
Cheer up.

170
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:42,501
It gets worse.

171
00:21:42,501 --> 00:21:44,503
My parakeet, Petey.

172
00:21:44,503 --> 00:21:47,506
He's dead.

173
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:50,509
Man, I'm sorry, Harry.

174
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:52,511
What happened?

175
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:54,513
His head fell off!

176
00:21:54,513 --> 00:21:55,514
His head fell off?

177
00:21:55,514 --> 00:21:58,517
Yeah, he was pretty old.

178
00:21:58,517 --> 00:22:01,520
That's it.

179
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,523
I've had it with this dump!

180
00:22:04,523 --> 00:22:08,516
We got no food.
We got no jobs.

181
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:16,524
Our pets' heads are falling off!

182
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:25,533
Just calm down.

183
00:22:35,554 --> 00:22:37,556
What the hell are
we doing here, Harry?

184
00:22:37,556 --> 00:22:42,561
-We gotta get out of this town!
-And go where? Where do we go?

185
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:47,566
I'll tell you where.

186
00:22:47,566 --> 00:22:52,571
Someplace warm.

187
00:22:52,571 --> 00:22:54,072
A place where the beer
flows like wine.

188
00:22:54,072 --> 00:22:55,061
Where beautiful women instinctively
flock like the salmon of Capistrano.

189
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:03,882
Excuse me.

190
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:08,876
Could you tell me
how to get to the medical school?

191
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:14,893
I'm giving a lecture in 20 minutes,
and my driver's a bit lost.

192
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:18,897
You go straight ahead,
and you make a left over the bridge.

193
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:22,901
That's a lovely accent you have.

194
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:24,903
New Jersey?

195
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:28,907
Austria.

196
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:33,901
Austria?

197
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:25,964
Well, then...

198
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:30,958
"G'day, mate."

199
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:48,976
" Let's put another shrimp
on the barbie."

200
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:54,993
Let's not.

201
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:57,996
Who's got the Wiener schnitzel?

202
00:24:57,996 --> 00:25:02,000
Beautiful. There you go, Dolf.

203
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,003
There you go, buddy.
Enjoy.

204
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:09,997
Let's see.
Next we've got roast beef au jus.

205
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:47,105
Who's got the roast beef au jus?
Stella, beautiful. Bon appétit.

206
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:52,099
Walk away, go on. Go on.

207
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:58,116
Last, but not least.

208
00:26:58,116 --> 00:27:00,118
Foot long! Who's got the foot long?

209
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:05,112
Very funny, Rascal.
Very funny. In your dreams.

210
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:07,125
Why haven't you dropped
those dogs off at the show?

211
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:11,129
Sir, I didn't want them
to perform on an empty stomach, sir.

212
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:13,131
Move it!

213
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:14,132
Yes, sir. Mutt Cutts. Ten-four.

214
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:18,136
Suck me sideways.

215
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:22,140
Hello. How are you?

216
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:27,134
I'll be out in one minute.

217
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:35,142
Why you going to the airport?
Flying somewhere?

218
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:49,167
How'd you guess?

219
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:54,161
I saw your luggage.

220
00:27:56,174 --> 00:28:01,179
When I noticed the airline ticket,
I put two and two together.

221
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:06,173
Where you headed?

222
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:15,182
Aspen.

223
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:21,199
California!

224
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:26,204
Beautiful.

225
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:27,205
Name's Christmas, Lloyd Christmas.

226
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:29,207
I'm Mary Swanson.

227
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:32,210
This isn't my real job.

228
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:33,211
No?

229
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:35,213
My friend Harry and I are saving up
to open a pet store.

230
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:39,217
That's nice.

231
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:44,211
" I Got Worms."

232
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:50,228
I beg your pardon?

233
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:54,232
That's the name, "l Got Worms."
We'll specialize in selling worm farms.

234
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:59,226
You know, like ant farms.

235
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:08,246
What's the matter?

236
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:11,249
Little tense about the flight?

237
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:16,243
Something like that.

238
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:22,260
Don't worry. Statistically, you're
more likely to get killed...

239
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:27,254
going to the airport,
like in a head-on crash...

240
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:37,275
flying off a cliff. Or trapped
under a gas truck! That's the worst.

241
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:41,279
I have this cousin,
well, I had this cousin...

242
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:46,273
Could you keep your eyes
on the road, please?

243
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:50,288
Oh, yeah.

244
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:51,289
Good thinking.

245
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:54,292
Can't be too careful.

246
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:59,297
Lot of bad drivers out there.

247
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:04,302
Okay, gang,
you know the rules:

248
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:06,304
no humping, no pushing,
no sniffing hineys.

249
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:08,306
Where were you? My dogs were supposed
to be here 40 minutes ago.

250
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:11,309
I hardly have
any time to primp them.

251
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:16,303
Don't worry, Mrs. Neugyburger.

252
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:23,321
-Neugeboren!
-Neu-neu-neug...

253
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:25,323
Boren!

254
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:28,326
These pooches won't need primping.
You know why?

255
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:32,330
Because I bathed them
and I clipped them myself.

256
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:37,324
And I stand by my performance.

257
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:45,332
On second thought, you might
want to run a comb through them.

258
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:50,348
Thanks.
Here you go.

259
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:53,351
Oh, no, Mary.

260
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:58,345
I couldn't possibly accept that.
Not after all we've been through.

261
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:04,351
Thank you, Lloyd.

262
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:11,358
Good luck with your worms.

263
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:17,364
How about a hug?

264
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:23,370
I hate good-byes.

265
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:30,377
Just go.

266
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:33,391
Be strong.

267
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:35,393
She's gonna leave the briefcase
near the escalator.

268
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:39,397
You make the pickup.

269
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:42,400
Piece of cake.

270
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:46,404
Good-bye, my love

271
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:49,407
There's our payday.

272
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:54,412
She left it.
Let's go.

273
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:59,406
Coming through!

274
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:04,411
Move it or lose it, Sister!

275
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:10,428
Eenie...

276
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:12,430
meenie...

277
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:17,435
minie...

278
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:22,429
mo!

279
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:28,446
Hold that plane!

280
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:33,440
Sir, you can't go in there!

281
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:42,460
It's okay!

282
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:47,465
I'm a limo driver!

283
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:49,467
-Hi, Lloyd.
-Hi, Harry.

284
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:54,461
How was your day?

285
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:16,483
Not bad.
Fell off the jet way again.

286
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:24,491
Who do you figure
this guy's working for?

287
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:30,508
I don't know...

288
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:34,501
but we sure as hell
better find out.

289
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:38,516
The ulcer?

290
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:43,510
I'll live.

291
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:47,525
So you got fired again?

292
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:50,528
Oh, yeah.

293
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:54,521
They always freak out when you leave
the scene of an accident.

294
00:33:57,535 --> 00:34:00,538
Yeah, well,
I lost my job too.

295
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:05,543
Man!

296
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:09,547
You are one pathetic loser.

297
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:14,552
No offense.

298
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:18,556
No. None taken.

299
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:20,558
You know what really
chaffs my ass though?

300
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:25,552
I spent my life savings
turning my van into a dog.

301
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:30,568
Hi, Petey.

302
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:34,572
The alarm alone
cost me 200.

303
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:39,566
Chicks love it.

304
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:45,572
It's a shagging wagon.

305
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:51,578
What's with the briefcase?

306
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:57,584
It's a love memento.

307
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:03,601
The most beautiful woman alive.

308
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:05,603
I drove her
to the airport...

309
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:08,606
sparks flew,
emotions ran high.

310
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:12,610
She actually talked to me.

311
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:17,615
Get out of here!

312
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:21,619
Oh, yeah.

313
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:26,613
Tractor beam.

314
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:32,619
Sucked me right in.

315
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:37,635
Anyway.

316
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:41,639
She left this
in the terminal and...

317
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:46,644
flew to Aspen
and out of my life.

318
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:51,638
What's in it?

319
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:57,655
Man!

320
00:35:57,655 --> 00:36:02,649
I'd have to be a lowlife to root around
in someone else's private property.

321
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:10,657
Is it locked?

322
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:18,676
Yeah, really well.

323
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:20,678
There's two of them.
One has a gun.

324
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:25,672
Did you pay the gas bill?

325
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:32,690
Do you realize
what you've done?

326
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:36,694
I'm sorry.
I say we bail.

327
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:41,699
Okay.

328
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:46,693
The briefcase ain't here.
He must have taken it with him.

329
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:53,700
He's got to
come home sometime.

330
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:59,717
Maybe we should trash the place.
Send him a little message.

331
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:03,721
I don't think he's going to get
that message, Joe.

332
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:08,715
I mean the guy's got
worms in his living room.

333
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:41,759
I got a better idea.

334
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:44,762
" I tought I taw a puddy tat.

335
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:49,756
Oh, I did. I did."
Come here.

336
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:55,762
I can't believe
we drove around all day...

337
00:37:57,775 --> 00:38:00,778
and there's not a single job
in this town.

338
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:05,783
-There is nothing, nada, zip.
-Yeah.

339
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:09,787
Unless you want to work
40 hours a week.

340
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:10,788
Here.
I'm gonna go to the store.

341
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:11,789
Just get the bare essentials.
That's the last of our dough.

342
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:13,791
What do I look like?

343
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:18,796
Cripes!

344
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:23,801
Excuse me, little old lady?

345
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:28,795
Do you have change
of a dollar?

346
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:38,805
Change?
No, I'm sorry. I don't.

347
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:46,824
Could you do me a favor
and watch my stuff...

348
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:47,825
while I go break a dollar?

349
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:50,828
-Of course.
-Thanks.

350
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:52,830
Hey, I guess they're right.

351
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:53,831
Senior citizens, although slow
and dangerous behind the wheel...

352
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:58,836
can still serve a purpose.

353
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:03,841
I'll be right back.
Don't you go dying on me.

354
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:08,846
Where's the booze?

355
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:13,851
I got robbed by a sweet old lady
on a motorized cart.

356
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:17,855
I didn't even see it coming.

357
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:22,849
Come on, Harry.
Cheer up.

358
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:34,861
It gets worse.

359
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:37,875
My parakeet, Petey.

360
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:42,869
He's dead.

361
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:49,887
Man, I'm sorry, Harry.

362
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:51,889
What happened?

363
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:56,894
His head fell off!

364
00:39:56,894 --> 00:39:58,396
His head fell off?

365
00:39:58,396 --> 00:39:59,385
Yeah, he was pretty old.

366
00:40:04,168 --> 00:40:06,170
Excuse me.

367
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:11,175
Could you tell me
how to get to the medical school?

368
00:40:11,175 --> 00:40:13,177
I'm giving a lecture in 20 minutes,
and my driver's a bit lost.

369
00:40:13,177 --> 00:40:14,178
You go straight ahead,
and you make a left over the bridge.

370
00:40:14,178 --> 00:40:18,171
That's a lovely accent you have.

371
00:40:24,188 --> 00:40:27,191
New Jersey?

372
00:40:27,191 --> 00:40:32,196
Austria.

373
00:40:32,196 --> 00:40:36,189
Austria?

374
00:40:40,204 --> 00:40:42,206
Well, then...

375
00:40:42,206 --> 00:40:47,200
"G'day, mate."

376
00:40:50,214 --> 00:40:55,208
" Let's put another shrimp
on the barbie."

377
00:40:58,222 --> 00:41:03,216
Let's not.

378
00:41:04,228 --> 00:41:08,221
Who's got the Wiener schnitzel?

379
00:41:10,234 --> 00:41:14,238
Beautiful. There you go, Dolf.

380
00:41:14,238 --> 00:41:16,240
There you go, buddy.
Enjoy.

381
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:19,243
Let's see.
Next we've got roast beef au jus.

382
00:41:19,243 --> 00:41:23,236
Who's got the roast beef au jus?
Stella, beautiful. Bon appétit.

383
00:41:24,248 --> 00:41:26,250
Walk away, go on. Go on.

384
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:28,252
Last, but not least.

385
00:41:28,252 --> 00:41:32,245
Foot long! Who's got the foot long?

386
00:43:13,357 --> 00:43:16,360
Very funny, Rascal.
Very funny. In your dreams.

387
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:20,364
Why haven't you dropped
those dogs off at the show?

388
00:43:20,364 --> 00:43:25,358
Sir, I didn't want them
to perform on an empty stomach, sir.

389
00:43:32,376 --> 00:43:36,380
Move it!

390
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:39,383
Yes, sir. Mutt Cutts. Ten-four.

391
00:43:39,383 --> 00:43:44,377
Suck me sideways.

392
00:43:45,389 --> 00:43:47,391
Hello. How are you?

393
00:43:47,391 --> 00:43:52,385
I'll be out in one minute.

394
00:43:53,397 --> 00:43:56,400
Why you going to the airport?
Flying somewhere?

395
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:00,393
How'd you guess?

396
00:44:03,407 --> 00:44:05,409
I saw your luggage.

397
00:44:05,409 --> 00:44:10,414
When I noticed the airline ticket,
I put two and two together.

398
00:44:10,414 --> 00:44:13,417
Where you headed?

399
00:44:13,417 --> 00:44:18,411
Aspen.

400
00:44:19,423 --> 00:44:21,425
California!

401
00:44:21,425 --> 00:44:26,430
Beautiful.

402
00:44:26,430 --> 00:44:30,423
Name's Christmas, Lloyd Christmas.

403
00:44:35,439 --> 00:44:40,433
I'm Mary Swanson.

404
00:44:42,446 --> 00:44:46,439
This isn't my real job.

405
00:44:53,457 --> 00:44:58,462
No?

406
00:44:58,462 --> 00:45:02,455
My friend Harry and I are saving up
to open a pet store.

407
00:45:03,467 --> 00:45:08,461
That's nice.

408
00:45:10,474 --> 00:45:15,468
" I Got Worms."

409
00:45:43,507 --> 00:45:48,501
I beg your pardon?

410
00:45:50,514 --> 00:45:55,508
That's the name, "l Got Worms."
We'll specialize in selling worm farms.

411
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:58,522
You know, like ant farms.

412
00:45:58,522 --> 00:46:03,527
What's the matter?

413
00:46:03,527 --> 00:46:08,521
Little tense about the flight?

414
00:46:13,537 --> 00:46:17,541
Something like that.

415
00:46:17,541 --> 00:46:21,545
Don't worry. Statistically, you're
more likely to get killed...

416
00:46:21,545 --> 00:46:25,538
going to the airport,
like in a head-on crash...

417
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:30,543
flying off a cliff. Or trapped
under a gas truck! That's the worst.

418
00:46:57,581 --> 00:47:02,586
I have this cousin,
well, I had this cousin...

419
00:47:02,586 --> 00:47:07,591
Could you keep your eyes
on the road, please?

420
00:47:07,591 --> 00:47:12,585
Oh, yeah.

421
00:47:14,598 --> 00:47:19,592
Good thinking.

422
00:47:21,605 --> 00:47:26,610
Can't be too careful.

423
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:29,613
Lot of bad drivers out there.

424
00:47:29,613 --> 00:47:30,614
Okay, gang,
you know the rules:

425
00:47:30,614 --> 00:47:31,615
no humping, no pushing,
no sniffing hineys.

426
00:47:31,615 --> 00:47:36,620
Where were you? My dogs were supposed
to be here 40 minutes ago.

427
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:39,623
I hardly have
any time to primp them.

428
00:47:39,623 --> 00:47:43,627
Don't worry, Mrs. Neugyburger.

429
00:47:43,627 --> 00:47:44,628
-Neugeboren!
-Neu-neu-neug...

430
00:47:44,628 --> 00:47:45,629
Boren!

431
00:47:45,629 --> 00:47:48,632
These pooches won't need primping.
You know why?

432
00:47:48,632 --> 00:47:51,635
Because I bathed them
and I clipped them myself.

433
00:47:51,635 --> 00:47:55,628
And I stand by my performance.

434
00:47:57,641 --> 00:48:01,634
On second thought, you might
want to run a comb through them.

435
00:48:04,648 --> 00:48:08,641
Thanks.
Here you go.

436
00:48:14,658 --> 00:48:18,651
Oh, no, Mary.

437
00:48:24,668 --> 00:48:26,670
I couldn't possibly accept that.
Not after all we've been through.

438
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:30,674
Thank you, Lloyd.

439
00:48:30,674 --> 00:48:33,677
Good luck with your worms.

440
00:48:33,677 --> 00:48:35,679
How about a hug?

441
00:48:35,679 --> 00:48:39,683
I hate good-byes.

442
00:48:39,683 --> 00:48:44,677
Just go.

443
00:48:45,689 --> 00:48:50,694
Be strong.

444
00:48:50,694 --> 00:48:53,697
She's gonna leave the briefcase
near the escalator.

445
00:48:53,697 --> 00:48:58,702
You make the pickup.

446
00:48:58,702 --> 00:49:00,704
Piece of cake.

447
00:49:00,704 --> 00:49:05,709
Good-bye, my love

448
00:49:05,709 --> 00:49:10,703
There's our payday.

449
00:49:12,716 --> 00:49:16,720
She left it.
Let's go.

450
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:19,723
Coming through!

451
00:49:19,723 --> 00:49:23,727
Move it or lose it, Sister!

452
00:49:23,727 --> 00:49:28,721
Eenie...

453
00:49:29,733 --> 00:49:31,735
meenie...

454
00:49:31,735 --> 00:49:35,728
minie...

455
00:49:38,742 --> 00:49:42,735
mo!

456
00:49:44,748 --> 00:49:49,753
Hold that plane!

457
00:49:49,753 --> 00:49:54,747
Sir, you can't go in there!

458
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:58,762
It's okay!

459
00:49:58,762 --> 00:49:59,763
I'm a limo driver!

460
00:49:59,763 --> 00:50:04,768
-Hi, Lloyd.
-Hi, Harry.

461
00:50:04,768 --> 00:50:07,771
How was your day?

462
00:50:07,771 --> 00:50:12,776
Not bad.
Fell off the jet way again.

463
00:50:12,776 --> 00:50:16,769
Who do you figure
this guy's working for?

464
00:50:19,783 --> 00:50:22,786
I don't know...

465
00:50:22,786 --> 00:50:23,787
but we sure as hell
better find out.

466
00:50:23,787 --> 00:50:27,791
The ulcer?

467
00:50:27,791 --> 00:50:29,793
I'll live.

468
00:50:29,793 --> 00:50:31,795
So you got fired again?

469
00:50:31,795 --> 00:50:35,799
Oh, yeah.

470
00:50:35,799 --> 00:50:40,804
They always freak out when you leave
the scene of an accident.

471
00:50:40,804 --> 00:50:44,808
Yeah, well,
I lost my job too.

472
00:50:44,808 --> 00:50:47,811
Man!

473
00:50:47,811 --> 00:50:48,812
You are one pathetic loser.

474
00:50:48,812 --> 00:50:51,815
No offense.

475
00:50:51,815 --> 00:50:55,819
No. None taken.

476
00:50:55,819 --> 00:50:57,821
You know what really
chaffs my ass though?

477
00:50:57,821 --> 00:51:00,824
I spent my life savings
turning my van into a dog.

478
00:51:00,824 --> 00:51:05,818
Hi, Petey.

479
00:51:06,830 --> 00:51:07,831
The alarm alone
cost me 200.

480
00:51:07,831 --> 00:51:12,836
Chicks love it.

481
00:51:12,836 --> 00:51:16,829
It's a shagging wagon.

482
00:51:18,842 --> 00:51:22,835
What's with the briefcase?

483
00:51:28,852 --> 00:51:32,845
It's a love memento.

484
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:38,862
The most beautiful woman alive.

485
00:51:38,862 --> 00:51:42,855
I drove her
to the airport...

486
00:51:44,868 --> 00:51:46,870
sparks flew,
emotions ran high.

487
00:51:46,870 --> 00:51:50,863
She actually talked to me.

488
00:51:53,877 --> 00:51:56,880
Get out of here!

489
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:58,882
Oh, yeah.

490
00:51:58,882 --> 00:52:01,885
Tractor beam.

491
00:52:01,885 --> 00:52:03,887
Sucked me right in.

492
00:52:03,887 --> 00:52:08,881
Anyway.

493
00:52:13,897 --> 00:52:16,900
She left this
in the terminal and...

494
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:19,903
flew to Aspen
and out of my life.

495
00:52:19,903 --> 00:52:23,896
What's in it?

496
00:52:27,911 --> 00:52:28,912
Man!

497
00:52:28,912 --> 00:52:33,917
I'd have to be a lowlife to root around
in someone else's private property.

498
00:52:33,917 --> 00:52:37,921
Is it locked?

499
00:52:37,921 --> 00:52:42,915
Yeah, really well.

500
00:52:43,927 --> 00:52:47,920
There's two of them.
One has a gun.

501
00:52:51,935 --> 00:52:55,939
Did you pay the gas bill?

502
00:52:55,939 --> 00:52:58,942
Do you realize
what you've done?

503
00:52:58,942 --> 00:53:02,946
I'm sorry.
I say we bail.

504
00:53:02,946 --> 00:53:06,939
Okay.

505
00:53:08,952 --> 00:53:13,946
The briefcase ain't here.
He must have taken it with him.

506
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:19,963
He's got to
come home sometime.

507
00:53:19,963 --> 00:53:23,967
Maybe we should trash the place.
Send him a little message.

508
00:53:23,967 --> 00:53:28,961
I don't think he's going to get
that message, Joe.

509
00:53:30,974 --> 00:53:35,968
I mean the guy's got
worms in his living room.

510
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:39,983
I got a better idea.

511
00:53:39,983 --> 00:53:43,976
" I tought I taw a puddy tat.

512
00:53:44,988 --> 00:53:49,982
Oh, I did. I did."
Come here.

513
00:54:36,039 --> 00:54:40,043
I can't believe
we drove around all day...

514
00:54:40,043 --> 00:54:42,045
and there's not a single job
in this town.

515
00:54:42,045 --> 00:54:46,049
-There is nothing, nada, zip.
-Yeah.

516
00:54:46,049 --> 00:54:47,050
Unless you want to work
40 hours a week.

517
00:54:47,050 --> 00:54:52,044
Here.
I'm gonna go to the store.

518
00:54:54,057 --> 00:54:56,059
Just get the bare essentials.
That's the last of our dough.

519
00:54:56,059 --> 00:55:00,063
What do I look like?

520
00:55:00,063 --> 00:55:03,066
Cripes!

521
00:55:03,066 --> 00:55:05,068
Excuse me, little old lady?

522
00:55:05,068 --> 00:55:10,062
Do you have change
of a dollar?

523
00:55:12,075 --> 00:55:17,069
Change?
No, I'm sorry. I don't.

524
00:55:21,084 --> 00:55:25,088
Could you do me a favor
and watch my stuff...

525
00:55:25,088 --> 00:55:29,081
while I go break a dollar?

526
00:55:34,097 --> 00:55:38,090
-Of course.
-Thanks.

527
00:55:41,104 --> 00:55:44,107
Hey, I guess they're right.

528
00:55:44,107 --> 00:55:47,110
Senior citizens, although slow
and dangerous behind the wheel...

529
00:55:47,110 --> 00:55:49,112
can still serve a purpose.

530
00:55:49,112 --> 00:55:53,116
I'll be right back.
Don't you go dying on me.

531
00:55:53,116 --> 00:55:57,120
Where's the booze?

532
00:55:57,120 --> 00:56:01,113
I got robbed by a sweet old lady
on a motorized cart.

533
00:56:02,125 --> 00:56:05,128
I didn't even see it coming.

534
00:56:05,128 --> 00:56:09,132
Come on, Harry.
Cheer up.

535
00:56:09,132 --> 00:56:14,126
It gets worse.

536
00:56:29,152 --> 00:56:33,156
My parakeet, Petey.

537
00:56:33,156 --> 00:56:37,149
He's dead.

538
00:56:41,164 --> 00:56:46,158
Man, I'm sorry, Harry.

539
00:56:58,181 --> 00:57:03,186
What happened?

540
00:57:03,186 --> 00:57:07,179
His head fell off!

541
00:57:09,192 --> 00:57:12,195
His head fell off?

542
00:57:12,195 --> 00:57:16,188
Yeah, he was pretty old.

543
00:57:19,202 --> 00:57:24,196
That's it.

544
00:57:26,209 --> 00:57:31,214
I've had it with this dump!

545
00:57:31,214 --> 00:57:34,217
We got no food.
We got no jobs.

546
00:57:34,217 --> 00:57:39,211
Our pets' heads are falling off!

547
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:19,262
Just calm down.

548
00:58:19,262 --> 00:58:24,256
What the hell are
we doing here, Harry?

549
00:59:25,328 --> 00:59:26,329
-We gotta get out of this town!
-And go where? Where do we go?

550
00:59:26,329 --> 00:59:27,330
I'll tell you where.

551
00:59:27,330 --> 00:59:28,331
Someplace warm.

552
00:59:28,331 --> 00:59:31,334
A place where the beer
flows like wine.

553
00:59:31,334 --> 00:59:33,336
Where beautiful women instinctively
flock like the salmon of Capistrano.

554
00:59:33,336 --> 00:59:37,340
I'm talking about a little place
called Aspen.

555
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:41,333
I don't know.
The French are assholes.

556
00:59:46,349 --> 00:59:51,343
Wait a minute!

557
00:59:53,356 --> 00:59:58,361
Wait a minute!
I know what you're up to, mister.

558
00:59:58,361 --> 01:00:01,364
You just want to go to Aspen and find
that girl who lost her briefcase...

559
01:00:01,364 --> 01:00:05,368
and you need me
to drive you there, right?

560
01:00:05,368 --> 01:00:07,370
Am I right?

561
01:00:07,370 --> 01:00:11,374
-Yeah, so?
-Am I right?

562
01:00:11,374 --> 01:00:13,376
I want to go someplace
where we know someone...

563
01:00:13,376 --> 01:00:16,868
who can plug us
into the social pipeline.

564
01:00:28,125 --> 01:00:30,127
Excuse me.

565
01:00:30,127 --> 01:00:31,128
Could you tell me
how to get to the medical school?

566
01:00:31,128 --> 01:00:35,132
I'm giving a lecture in 20 minutes,
and my driver's a bit lost.

567
01:00:35,132 --> 01:00:37,134
You go straight ahead,
and you make a left over the bridge.

568
01:00:37,134 --> 01:00:42,139
That's a lovely accent you have.

569
01:00:42,139 --> 01:00:47,133
New Jersey?

570
01:00:49,146 --> 01:00:54,140
Austria.

571
01:00:57,154 --> 01:01:02,148
Austria?

572
01:01:07,164 --> 01:01:10,167
Well, then...

573
01:01:10,167 --> 01:01:13,170
"G'day, mate."

574
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:17,174
" Let's put another shrimp
on the barbie."

575
01:01:17,174 --> 01:01:21,178
Let's not.

576
01:01:21,178 --> 01:01:26,172
Who's got the Wiener schnitzel?

577
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:52,209
Beautiful. There you go, Dolf.

578
01:01:52,209 --> 01:01:55,212
There you go, buddy.
Enjoy.

579
01:01:55,212 --> 01:01:58,215
Let's see.
Next we've got roast beef au jus.

580
01:01:58,215 --> 01:01:59,216
Who's got the roast beef au jus?
Stella, beautiful. Bon appétit.

581
01:01:59,216 --> 01:02:02,219
Walk away, go on. Go on.

582
01:02:02,219 --> 01:02:07,213
Last, but not least.

583
01:02:08,225 --> 01:02:12,218
Foot long! Who's got the foot long?

584
01:03:29,306 --> 01:03:31,308
Very funny, Rascal.
Very funny. In your dreams.

585
01:03:31,308 --> 01:03:35,301
Why haven't you dropped
those dogs off at the show?

586
01:04:39,376 --> 01:04:43,369
Sir, I didn't want them
to perform on an empty stomach, sir.

587
01:04:45,382 --> 01:04:48,385
Move it!

588
01:04:48,385 --> 01:04:49,386
Yes, sir. Mutt Cutts. Ten-four.

589
01:04:49,386 --> 01:04:53,390
Suck me sideways.

590
01:04:53,390 --> 01:04:57,383
Hello. How are you?

591
01:06:05,462 --> 01:06:07,464
I'll be out in one minute.

592
01:06:07,464 --> 01:06:12,458
Why you going to the airport?
Flying somewhere?

593
01:06:49,506 --> 01:06:50,507
How'd you guess?

594
01:06:50,507 --> 01:06:54,500
I saw your luggage.

595
01:06:58,515 --> 01:07:01,518
When I noticed the airline ticket,
I put two and two together.

596
01:07:01,518 --> 01:07:05,522
Where you headed?

597
01:07:05,522 --> 01:07:08,525
Aspen.

598
01:07:08,525 --> 01:07:12,518
California!

599
01:07:16,533 --> 01:07:21,538
Beautiful.

600
01:07:21,538 --> 01:07:24,541
Name's Christmas, Lloyd Christmas.

601
01:07:24,541 --> 01:07:27,544
I'm Mary Swanson.

602
01:07:27,544 --> 01:07:32,538
This isn't my real job.

603
01:07:33,550 --> 01:07:37,543
No?

604
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:48,565
My friend Harry and I are saving up
to open a pet store.

605
01:07:48,565 --> 01:07:52,558
That's nice.

606
01:07:54,571 --> 01:07:59,565
" I Got Worms."

607
01:08:31,608 --> 01:08:36,613
I beg your pardon?

608
01:08:36,613 --> 01:08:40,617
That's the name, "l Got Worms."
We'll specialize in selling worm farms.

609
01:08:40,617 --> 01:08:45,622
You know, like ant farms.

610
01:08:45,622 --> 01:08:48,625
What's the matter?

611
01:08:48,625 --> 01:08:50,627
Little tense about the flight?

612
01:08:50,627 --> 01:08:52,629
Something like that.

613
01:08:52,629 --> 01:08:57,623
Don't worry. Statistically, you're
more likely to get killed...

614
01:09:09,646 --> 01:09:13,650
going to the airport,
like in a head-on crash...

615
01:09:13,650 --> 01:09:17,654
flying off a cliff. Or trapped
under a gas truck! That's the worst.

616
01:09:17,654 --> 01:09:20,657
I have this cousin,
well, I had this cousin...

617
01:09:20,657 --> 01:09:25,662
Could you keep your eyes
on the road, please?

618
01:09:25,662 --> 01:09:30,667
Oh, yeah.

619
01:09:30,667 --> 01:09:32,669
Good thinking.

620
01:09:32,669 --> 01:09:37,674
Can't be too careful.

621
01:09:37,674 --> 01:09:42,679
Lot of bad drivers out there.

622
01:09:42,679 --> 01:09:47,673
Okay, gang,
you know the rules:

623
01:09:53,690 --> 01:09:56,693
no humping, no pushing,
no sniffing hineys.

624
01:09:56,693 --> 01:10:01,698
Where were you? My dogs were supposed
to be here 40 minutes ago.

625
01:10:01,698 --> 01:10:06,692
I hardly have
any time to primp them.

626
01:10:07,704 --> 01:10:12,698
Don't worry, Mrs. Neugyburger.

627
01:10:48,745 --> 01:10:52,738
-Neugeboren!
-Neu-neu-neug...

628
01:11:40,797 --> 01:11:44,801
Boren!

629
01:11:44,801 --> 01:11:50,807
These pooches won't need primping.
You know why?

630
01:11:50,807 --> 01:11:52,809
Because I bathed them
and I clipped them myself.

631
01:11:52,809 --> 01:11:57,803
And I stand by my performance.

632
01:11:59,816 --> 01:12:04,821
On second thought, you might
want to run a comb through them.

633
01:12:04,821 --> 01:12:06,823
Thanks.
Here you go.

634
01:12:06,823 --> 01:12:11,817
Oh, no, Mary.

635
01:12:13,830 --> 01:12:15,832
I couldn't possibly accept that.
Not after all we've been through.

636
01:12:15,832 --> 01:12:20,826
Thank you, Lloyd.

637
01:12:30,847 --> 01:12:33,850
Good luck with your worms.

638
01:12:33,850 --> 01:12:34,851
How about a hug?

639
01:12:34,851 --> 01:12:37,854
I hate good-byes.

640
01:12:37,854 --> 01:12:39,856
Just go.

641
01:12:39,856 --> 01:12:44,861
Be strong.

642
01:12:44,861 --> 01:12:45,862
She's gonna leave the briefcase
near the escalator.

643
01:12:45,862 --> 01:12:46,863
You make the pickup.

644
01:12:46,863 --> 01:12:49,866
Piece of cake.

645
01:12:49,866 --> 01:12:54,871
Good-bye, my love

646
01:12:54,871 --> 01:12:56,873
There's our payday.

647
01:12:56,873 --> 01:13:01,867
She left it.
Let's go.

648
01:13:04,881 --> 01:13:09,886
Coming through!

649
01:13:09,886 --> 01:13:11,888
Move it or lose it, Sister!

650
01:13:11,888 --> 01:13:15,881
Eenie...

651
01:13:17,894 --> 01:13:21,898
meenie...

652
01:13:21,898 --> 01:13:24,901
minie...

653
01:13:24,901 --> 01:13:29,895
mo!

654
01:13:30,907 --> 01:13:33,910
Hold that plane!

655
01:13:33,910 --> 01:13:37,914
Sir, you can't go in there!

656
01:13:37,914 --> 01:13:42,919
It's okay!

657
01:13:42,919 --> 01:13:47,913
I'm a limo driver!

658
01:13:48,925 --> 01:13:51,928
-Hi, Lloyd.
-Hi, Harry.

659
01:13:51,928 --> 01:13:56,922
How was your day?

660
01:14:32,969 --> 01:14:36,973
Not bad.
Fell off the jet way again.

661
01:14:36,973 --> 01:14:41,978
Who do you figure
this guy's working for?

662
01:14:41,978 --> 01:14:46,972
I don't know...

663
01:14:47,984 --> 01:14:51,988
but we sure as hell
better find out.

664
01:14:51,988 --> 01:14:53,990
The ulcer?

665
01:14:53,990 --> 01:14:57,983
I'll live.

666
01:15:00,997 --> 01:15:01,998
So you got fired again?

667
01:15:01,998 --> 01:15:06,002
Oh, yeah.

668
01:15:06,002 --> 01:15:08,004
They always freak out when you leave
the scene of an accident.

669
01:15:08,004 --> 01:15:12,008
Yeah, well,
I lost my job too.

670
01:15:12,008 --> 01:15:16,012
Man!

671
01:15:16,012 --> 01:15:20,005
You are one pathetic loser.

672
01:15:30,026 --> 01:15:34,030
No offense.

673
01:15:34,030 --> 01:15:38,023
No. None taken.

674
01:15:56,052 --> 01:15:58,054
You know what really
chaffs my ass though?

675
01:15:58,054 --> 01:15:59,055
I spent my life savings
turning my van into a dog.

676
01:15:59,055 --> 01:16:03,048
Hi, Petey.

677
01:16:52,108 --> 01:16:56,101
The alarm alone
cost me 200.

678
01:17:20,136 --> 01:17:24,129
Chicks love it.

679
01:17:30,146 --> 01:17:32,148
It's a shagging wagon.

680
01:17:32,148 --> 01:17:34,150
What's with the briefcase?

681
01:17:34,150 --> 01:17:38,143
It's a love memento.

682
01:17:40,156 --> 01:17:44,149
The most beautiful woman alive.

683
01:17:46,162 --> 01:17:50,155
I drove her
to the airport...

684
01:18:59,235 --> 01:19:03,228
sparks flew,
emotions ran high.

685
01:19:09,245 --> 01:19:13,238
She actually talked to me.

686
01:22:56,472 --> 01:23:00,476
Get out of here!

687
01:23:00,476 --> 01:23:04,469
Oh, yeah.

688
01:23:06,482 --> 01:23:11,476
Tractor beam.

689
01:23:13,489 --> 01:23:15,491
Sucked me right in.

690
01:23:15,491 --> 01:23:16,492
Anyway.

691
01:23:16,492 --> 01:23:21,497
She left this
in the terminal and...

692
01:23:21,497 --> 01:23:25,490
flew to Aspen
and out of my life.

693
01:23:27,503 --> 01:23:31,496
What's in it?

694
01:23:51,527 --> 01:23:56,521
Man!

695
01:23:57,533 --> 01:24:01,537
I'd have to be a lowlife to root around
in someone else's private property.

696
01:24:01,537 --> 01:24:06,531
Is it locked?

697
01:24:09,545 --> 01:24:12,548
Yeah, really well.

698
01:24:12,548 --> 01:24:17,542
There's two of them.
One has a gun.

699
01:24:19,555 --> 01:24:23,559
Did you pay the gas bill?

700
01:24:23,559 --> 01:24:28,553
Do you realize
what you've done?

701
01:24:37,573 --> 01:24:42,567
I'm sorry.
I say we bail.

702
01:24:45,581 --> 01:24:47,583
Okay.

703
01:24:47,583 --> 01:24:52,588
The briefcase ain't here.
He must have taken it with him.

704
01:24:52,588 --> 01:24:56,581
He's got to
come home sometime.

705
01:24:59,595 --> 01:25:01,597
Maybe we should trash the place.
Send him a little message.

706
01:25:01,597 --> 01:25:06,591
I don't think he's going to get
that message, Joe.

707
01:25:08,604 --> 01:25:13,598
I mean the guy's got
worms in his living room.

708
01:25:16,612 --> 01:25:20,616
I got a better idea.

709
01:25:20,616 --> 01:25:23,619
" I tought I taw a puddy tat.

710
01:25:23,619 --> 01:25:25,621
Oh, I did. I did."
Come here.

711
01:25:25,621 --> 01:25:27,623
I can't believe
we drove around all day...

712
01:25:27,623 --> 01:25:30,626
and there's not a single job
in this town.

713
01:25:30,626 --> 01:25:35,620
-There is nothing, nada, zip.
-Yeah.

714
01:25:52,648 --> 01:25:55,651
Unless you want to work
40 hours a week.

715
01:25:55,651 --> 01:26:00,645
Here.
I'm gonna go to the store.

716
01:26:02,658 --> 01:26:07,652
Just get the bare essentials.
That's the last of our dough.

717
01:26:09,665 --> 01:26:12,668
What do I look like?

718
01:26:12,668 --> 01:26:17,673
Cripes!

719
01:26:17,673 --> 01:26:21,666
Excuse me, little old lady?

720
01:26:23,679 --> 01:26:24,680
Do you have change
of a dollar?

721
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:28,673
Change?
No, I'm sorry. I don't.

722
01:26:34,690 --> 01:26:36,692
Could you do me a favor
and watch my stuff...

723
01:26:36,692 --> 01:26:41,686
while I go break a dollar?

724
01:26:43,699 --> 01:26:45,701
-Of course.
-Thanks.

725
01:26:45,701 --> 01:26:50,695
Hey, I guess they're right.

726
01:26:51,707 --> 01:26:56,701
Senior citizens, although slow
and dangerous behind the wheel...

727
01:26:57,713 --> 01:27:01,706
can still serve a purpose.
