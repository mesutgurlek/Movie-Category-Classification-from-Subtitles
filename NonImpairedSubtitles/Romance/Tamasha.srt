1
00:01:29,543 --> 00:01:31,668
Sometimes this thought
enters my heart

2
00:01:31,668 --> 00:01:35,501
So loudly that you soil your pants

3
00:01:37,168 --> 00:01:39,251
Sometimes this thought
enters my heart

4
00:01:39,418 --> 00:01:41,251
So what enters your mind?

5
00:01:41,543 --> 00:01:43,793
Tell me

6
00:01:43,793 --> 00:01:45,918
Shut up. Quiet. Silence.

7
00:01:45,918 --> 00:01:48,001
Sometimes this thought
enters my heart

8
00:01:48,001 --> 00:01:51,335
Who am I?
- I know

9
00:01:52,918 --> 00:01:58,376
You go to work and come home
every day

10
00:01:59,168 --> 00:02:03,876
The boss yells at you.
You tell no one

11
00:02:04,793 --> 00:02:10,835
You're one of hundreds,
packed in a crowded bus

12
00:02:11,168 --> 00:02:14,043
Warning. The audience has arrived

13
00:02:14,043 --> 00:02:15,460
Go. Go.

14
00:02:16,043 --> 00:02:18,001
How can I go without you?

15
00:02:18,376 --> 00:02:23,460
We're connected.
Inseparable, eternally

16
00:02:23,793 --> 00:02:25,585
Live and die together

17
00:02:25,918 --> 00:02:28,335
Two bodies, one soul

18
00:02:28,793 --> 00:02:33,751
SOS SOS Charlie come
in Charlie Security

19
00:02:34,168 --> 00:02:36,126
Forgive the poor chap

20
00:02:36,126 --> 00:02:40,251
A nice guy like you.
But what to do?

21
00:02:40,626 --> 00:02:45,626
He's stuck between the heart
and the world. Like you

22
00:02:46,293 --> 00:02:48,585
There's more to come

23
00:02:49,543 --> 00:02:52,876
You see I am here

24
00:02:53,668 --> 00:02:55,126
His heart's voice

25
00:02:58,793 --> 00:03:02,543
The heart skips a beat

26
00:03:02,543 --> 00:03:04,626
What is a heart?

27
00:03:04,793 --> 00:03:07,126
The heart! The heart!

28
00:03:08,043 --> 00:03:11,751
Disruptive technology
A B theeta beeta gaama

29
00:03:12,001 --> 00:03:15,418
Five hundred and seventy-five
methods, fester.

30
00:03:15,418 --> 00:03:19,293
He's prepared a play for you

31
00:03:19,293 --> 00:03:20,501
Straight from the heart

32
00:03:20,918 --> 00:03:23,585
Clap if you like it

33
00:03:25,043 --> 00:03:28,251
So? Are you sitting comfortably?

34
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:30,876
Shall we start?

35
00:03:51,001 --> 00:03:54,210
He did so badly,
got the lowest marks

36
00:03:54,626 --> 00:03:58,501
He can't solve the simplest problem

37
00:03:58,501 --> 00:03:59,626
I understand that

38
00:03:59,793 --> 00:04:03,293
Ask him what's wrong

39
00:04:03,293 --> 00:04:06,460
Stories obsess him

40
00:04:59,251 --> 00:05:00,251
Got the money?

41
00:05:01,293 --> 00:05:02,376
Let's go

42
00:05:23,293 --> 00:05:24,751
Half an hour

43
00:05:38,001 --> 00:05:39,501
Many years ago

44
00:05:40,168 --> 00:05:45,001
A million miles away, there was
a unique land

45
00:05:45,626 --> 00:05:52,001
Made famous, not by the King,
but by the Prince

46
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:54,001
A rare Prince

47
00:05:54,376 --> 00:05:55,876
The heartbeat of all

48
00:05:56,043 --> 00:05:58,751
The apple of all eyes

49
00:05:59,168 --> 00:06:01,876
Ayodhya sang His praises

50
00:06:02,418 --> 00:06:04,960
But He chose exile over throne

51
00:06:06,043 --> 00:06:09,251
He who slayed the evil Ravaan...

52
00:06:10,001 --> 00:06:11,376
...the one they call...

53
00:06:11,376 --> 00:06:13,126
Hail shri Ram!

54
00:06:34,626 --> 00:06:37,251
The forest is strewn with thorns,
my Queen

55
00:06:38,043 --> 00:06:43,085
You're delicate, a Princess
The forest is not a place for you

56
00:06:43,543 --> 00:06:45,960
All the world's comforts...

57
00:06:46,626 --> 00:06:49,751
...mean nothing without you,
my Lord

58
00:06:50,251 --> 00:06:52,501
With your hand in mine...

59
00:06:53,376 --> 00:06:56,793
...thorns are flowers to me

60
00:06:56,793 --> 00:06:58,501
Beware, Princess

61
00:06:59,668 --> 00:07:03,085
The forest is as dangerous
as it is beautiful

62
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:05,460
Lakshman will protect you

63
00:07:06,876 --> 00:07:10,751
I shall now hunt that deer

64
00:07:12,751 --> 00:07:14,001
That's all

65
00:07:15,418 --> 00:07:17,501
Half an hour. Go

66
00:07:17,751 --> 00:07:19,501
What happens next?

67
00:07:19,876 --> 00:07:22,626
End of story...money over Scoot!

68
00:07:23,126 --> 00:07:26,626
A little more. Please

69
00:07:30,251 --> 00:07:31,501
5 minutes

70
00:07:52,418 --> 00:07:53,960
Are you done?

71
00:07:54,501 --> 00:07:55,710
Grandma

72
00:08:10,793 --> 00:08:14,376
"I shall now hunt that deer"

73
00:08:20,793 --> 00:08:22,085
Where was I?

74
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:25,918
The evil Ravaan abducts Sita

75
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:29,501
When the noble king returned,
the Princess was gone

76
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:32,001
The evil king had taken her...

77
00:08:32,001 --> 00:08:35,001
...across the seas to Troy

78
00:08:35,168 --> 00:08:37,376
The King called all the Greek kings

79
00:08:37,376 --> 00:08:41,001
Brothers!
Set sail a thousand ships

80
00:08:41,293 --> 00:08:42,751
Fight the great Trojan war

81
00:08:43,043 --> 00:08:46,251
Bring back my honour, my Helen

82
00:08:46,418 --> 00:08:47,501
Wait!

83
00:08:48,001 --> 00:08:50,376
Something's wrong
- What?

84
00:08:50,751 --> 00:08:53,918
You told me a different story
the last time

85
00:08:53,918 --> 00:08:58,251
The demon king Ravaan carried
Sita away to Lanka

86
00:09:02,043 --> 00:09:04,501
So what's the problem?

87
00:09:04,876 --> 00:09:06,418
A story is a stow

88
00:09:06,418 --> 00:09:08,835
Same everywhere

89
00:09:09,293 --> 00:09:12,960
In Ayodhya or in Greece

90
00:09:13,626 --> 00:09:17,751
Laila- Majnu. Romeo- Juliet.
Alexander's Victory

91
00:09:18,168 --> 00:09:19,543
The Battle of Lanka

92
00:09:19,543 --> 00:09:22,626
Your story too is like all stories

93
00:09:23,001 --> 00:09:24,876
It's always the same story

94
00:09:25,543 --> 00:09:28,501
Ignore the why, the where
and the what

95
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:31,335
Take pleasure in the story

96
00:09:33,001 --> 00:09:35,335
Are you comfortable?
Shall we begin?

97
00:09:36,251 --> 00:09:38,585
The story begins with a rhythm

98
00:09:39,376 --> 00:09:41,751
Starting from Time itself

99
00:09:42,418 --> 00:09:44,751
Running free through words

100
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,876
A story within a love stow

101
00:09:48,418 --> 00:09:50,876
An age- old story

102
00:09:51,501 --> 00:09:54,876
The story of our new love

103
00:09:55,668 --> 00:10:01,751
Who knows from where the story
flows or where it goes

104
00:10:34,293 --> 00:10:38,418
Like the river Chenaab,
flowing with love

105
00:10:38,418 --> 00:10:43,376
Sohni goes to Mahiwal

106
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:47,960
Her name was Sohni
And she belonged to Mahiwal

107
00:10:48,751 --> 00:10:50,835
Scared of King

108
00:10:51,126 --> 00:10:56,501
Vasudev crosses
the river with Krishana

109
00:10:57,418 --> 00:11:07,501
Pharoah's sister picks
Moses from the river

110
00:11:15,876 --> 00:11:17,376
So the day had come when...

111
00:11:17,376 --> 00:11:19,085
...Sanyunkta had to get married.

112
00:11:19,376 --> 00:11:21,876
Several rulers from
all over the world..

113
00:11:21,876 --> 00:11:24,501
...had come to her palace,
to get married to her.

114
00:11:24,668 --> 00:11:26,960
But she only liked
Prithvi Raj Chauhan.

115
00:11:54,543 --> 00:11:56,251
And so the story flows on

116
00:11:56,251 --> 00:11:57,751
Who does she go to?

117
00:12:00,043 --> 00:12:04,251
Who calls her from beyond
society's confines?

118
00:12:05,668 --> 00:12:08,626
With garland in hand...

119
00:12:09,043 --> 00:12:11,626
...Sanjunkta comes out of the palace

120
00:12:11,626 --> 00:12:12,710
Sayunkta!

121
00:12:15,668 --> 00:12:17,460
Yamuna or Jamuna?

122
00:12:17,918 --> 00:12:19,626
Joseph or Yusuf?

123
00:12:20,043 --> 00:12:21,626
Jesus or Isa?

124
00:12:22,126 --> 00:12:24,251
Moses or Musa?
Tell me

125
00:12:25,918 --> 00:12:28,126
Brahma or Abraham?

126
00:12:28,918 --> 00:12:30,710
Or Ibrahim?

127
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:34,126
A Hindu river or Indus?

128
00:12:34,418 --> 00:12:35,751
Hind or India?

129
00:12:35,918 --> 00:12:36,710
It's Sanjukta

130
00:12:37,043 --> 00:12:39,251
And so the story flows on

131
00:12:39,418 --> 00:12:45,460
And so the story flows on

132
00:12:46,626 --> 00:12:55,626
And so the story flows on

133
00:12:56,293 --> 00:12:58,585
The story begins with a rhythm

134
00:12:59,376 --> 00:13:02,001
From the start of Time itself

135
00:13:02,376 --> 00:13:04,710
Running free through words

136
00:13:05,418 --> 00:13:07,751
A story within a love stow

137
00:13:08,418 --> 00:13:10,876
An age- old story

138
00:13:11,418 --> 00:13:14,835
The story of our new love

139
00:13:15,668 --> 00:13:22,001
Who knows from where the story
flows or where it goes

140
00:13:28,543 --> 00:13:34,210
Why suffer the pain of separation?

141
00:13:34,543 --> 00:13:40,376
When it is you I see in my heart

142
00:13:41,293 --> 00:13:46,335
I count each passing moment

143
00:13:46,793 --> 00:13:52,918
Years have gone since
I gave myself to you

144
00:13:52,918 --> 00:13:58,710
My eyes have been
shedding tears since morning

145
00:13:59,043 --> 00:14:04,710
It's hard to describe
my love in words

146
00:14:05,043 --> 00:14:11,126
Should I end my life or end
this distance?

147
00:14:11,543 --> 00:14:16,876
Or fill this distance with
sweet memories of you?

148
00:14:29,251 --> 00:14:31,210
"My heart's wrenching."

149
00:14:32,126 --> 00:14:34,626
"I will explain you how."

150
00:14:35,168 --> 00:14:36,335
"Sita."

151
00:14:38,751 --> 00:14:40,751
There's the flag of
rebellion soaring high

152
00:14:40,751 --> 00:14:43,168
The Emperor feared...

153
00:14:43,168 --> 00:14:45,668
...the Prince would fall in love

154
00:14:45,668 --> 00:14:48,376
Bring shame to his name

155
00:14:48,376 --> 00:14:50,126
Helen belonged to Troy

156
00:14:50,293 --> 00:14:52,668
The undefeatable Raavan

157
00:14:52,668 --> 00:14:55,126
A fierce battle cry

158
00:14:55,126 --> 00:14:58,001
Ranjha belongs to you

159
00:14:59,043 --> 00:15:02,626
The genie appeared before Aladdin

160
00:15:02,626 --> 00:15:05,001
"Your wish is
my command, Master"

161
00:15:53,793 --> 00:15:54,751
You are not listening to me...

162
00:15:54,918 --> 00:15:56,418
I am not asking for money,

163
00:15:56,418 --> 00:15:59,043
lam asking to make a call...
A phone call...

164
00:15:59,043 --> 00:16:01,043
No no phone, go...

165
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:02,376
It'll be one second, okay?

166
00:16:02,543 --> 00:16:03,793
I'll just call and quickly
ask them to call back.

167
00:16:03,793 --> 00:16:05,085
No, no!

168
00:16:05,668 --> 00:16:08,126
Please one phone call, please...

169
00:16:08,293 --> 00:16:11,001
No no no money go
- Okay fine

170
00:16:11,418 --> 00:16:15,001
Bloody miser! Swine.
Die, you rascal

171
00:16:15,376 --> 00:16:16,543
Thank you
- Thank you

172
00:16:16,543 --> 00:16:17,376
Go, go

173
00:16:19,918 --> 00:16:21,293
Please...please...

174
00:16:21,293 --> 00:16:23,251
No money go

175
00:16:23,418 --> 00:16:24,293
Fine

176
00:16:24,293 --> 00:16:28,668
Bloody miser! Swine.
Die, you rascal

177
00:16:28,668 --> 00:16:30,751
Thank you.. Go, go

178
00:16:53,626 --> 00:16:54,751
Excuse me.

179
00:16:55,793 --> 00:16:57,210
You said bloody miser?

180
00:16:58,001 --> 00:17:00,418
I was just telling that..
- Swine..

181
00:17:00,418 --> 00:17:03,251
To make one call,
it was just going to take one second.

182
00:17:04,543 --> 00:17:05,460
Here.

183
00:17:05,793 --> 00:17:06,918
I have to call India.

184
00:17:06,918 --> 00:17:08,460
It's OK, go ahead

185
00:17:13,668 --> 00:17:15,376
My bag's gone

186
00:17:15,793 --> 00:17:17,960
Passport, phone, wallet

187
00:17:18,376 --> 00:17:20,751
That bag one should never lose

188
00:17:21,418 --> 00:17:22,751
Or someone stole it

189
00:17:22,751 --> 00:17:28,418
I went back. I looked everywhere.
No one speaks English

190
00:17:28,418 --> 00:17:31,126
Bloody Asterix in Corsica

191
00:17:31,751 --> 00:17:32,751
Sorry.

192
00:17:34,418 --> 00:17:35,960
I mean the Asterix comics

193
00:17:37,043 --> 00:17:38,835
That's the reason actually.

194
00:17:39,418 --> 00:17:41,543
"Asterix in Corsica,"
my favorite comic

195
00:17:41,543 --> 00:17:44,001
I always thought I'd come here
one day

196
00:17:44,293 --> 00:17:47,585
Phone first. ok?

197
00:17:59,793 --> 00:18:01,251
Hi.
- Hi.

198
00:18:02,043 --> 00:18:04,751
They'll call back, OK?

199
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:06,126
Absolutely

200
00:18:07,168 --> 00:18:08,501
Five minutes

201
00:18:09,626 --> 00:18:12,626
I'll just...
- Yeah, sure.

202
00:18:16,918 --> 00:18:19,626
By the way, thank you.
- Please, you don't have to do that.

203
00:18:19,626 --> 00:18:20,876
No, I have to do it.

204
00:18:21,168 --> 00:18:22,501
I was in a state

205
00:18:23,043 --> 00:18:25,210
If you weren't there...

206
00:18:27,126 --> 00:18:28,501
By the way, my name is..
- Stop.

207
00:18:30,918 --> 00:18:32,001
One sec.

208
00:18:34,418 --> 00:18:35,501
Pause.

209
00:18:40,668 --> 00:18:43,001
You'll tell me your name,
I'll tell you mine

210
00:18:43,168 --> 00:18:44,543
We become friends

211
00:18:44,543 --> 00:18:48,251
Where we live, what we do Say:
"Wow! Small world!"

212
00:18:48,668 --> 00:18:51,626
Mutual friends

213
00:18:51,918 --> 00:18:54,793
I'll tell you old jokes.
Try impressing you

214
00:18:54,793 --> 00:18:55,876
I'll behave decently

215
00:18:56,043 --> 00:18:58,876
Behave decently? In Corsica?

216
00:18:59,793 --> 00:19:01,043
Tough finding a place...

217
00:19:01,043 --> 00:19:04,501
...where no one knows me.
I can be anyone, do anything

218
00:19:04,501 --> 00:19:05,626
I'm Don!

219
00:19:09,918 --> 00:19:14,210
The police from 12 countries
are looking for me and I wait here...

220
00:19:14,918 --> 00:19:16,501
...for Teja's gold

221
00:19:18,543 --> 00:19:19,626
And you?

222
00:19:20,418 --> 00:19:21,376
Me?

223
00:19:21,543 --> 00:19:23,251
Yes, you

224
00:19:24,418 --> 00:19:25,876
You must have a name

225
00:19:27,543 --> 00:19:29,001
lam Mona

226
00:19:30,626 --> 00:19:32,085
Mona Darling

227
00:19:33,126 --> 00:19:34,376
I work with Teja

228
00:19:35,501 --> 00:19:37,501
Should I call you Mona or...

229
00:19:39,126 --> 00:19:40,210
...Darling?

230
00:19:40,501 --> 00:19:41,626
Mr Don

231
00:19:41,626 --> 00:19:42,751
I like it

232
00:19:43,293 --> 00:19:47,710
But how can I be sure that
you have the gold?

233
00:19:51,001 --> 00:19:53,751
How can I be sure that you're Don?

234
00:19:54,418 --> 00:19:56,418
Proof is the law's thing

235
00:19:56,418 --> 00:19:59,835
And Don doesn't play by those rules

236
00:20:00,918 --> 00:20:04,835
May I ask why Teja isn't here?

237
00:20:05,793 --> 00:20:09,876
Mr Teja has a dentist
appointment, sir

238
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:15,210
He's having root canal
treatment miles away

239
00:20:20,168 --> 00:20:21,376
Interpol!

240
00:20:24,751 --> 00:20:25,876
I'll handle it

241
00:20:30,918 --> 00:20:31,876
Hello...

242
00:20:32,543 --> 00:20:33,626
Yeah... dad...

243
00:20:56,293 --> 00:20:57,876
Madam...hey...

244
00:20:58,543 --> 00:20:59,501
Hello..

245
00:21:09,793 --> 00:21:12,460
I'm a Son of a B***-

246
00:21:13,668 --> 00:21:16,876
Correct. You look like one

247
00:21:17,876 --> 00:21:19,710
lam a son of a hm

248
00:21:20,168 --> 00:21:21,001
Again

249
00:21:21,001 --> 00:21:23,126
lam a son of a hm

250
00:21:48,126 --> 00:21:48,876
Don?

251
00:21:48,876 --> 00:21:49,626
Yes.

252
00:21:59,668 --> 00:22:01,126
Bon appétit

253
00:22:14,168 --> 00:22:15,210
Hello..

254
00:22:26,876 --> 00:22:28,835
Name... name what?

255
00:22:29,293 --> 00:22:31,876
Antoniya...
- Antoniya

256
00:22:33,418 --> 00:22:37,835
Feeding the hungry was a
good move. But drinks too?

257
00:22:38,376 --> 00:22:39,501
I don't know

258
00:22:40,251 --> 00:22:42,501
Why? What do you plan to do?

259
00:22:52,626 --> 00:22:53,751
I also don't know.

260
00:23:16,418 --> 00:23:18,626
What is this place?

261
00:23:19,793 --> 00:23:21,210
Where are we?

262
00:23:22,418 --> 00:23:23,626
Shall I tell you?

263
00:23:24,668 --> 00:23:26,876
At once upon a time...

264
00:23:27,918 --> 00:23:29,626
A story begins

265
00:23:31,918 --> 00:23:33,751
Will the story be good?

266
00:23:35,543 --> 00:23:37,251
Always the same

267
00:23:37,668 --> 00:23:42,251
Boy meets girl,
starts hitting on her

268
00:23:42,251 --> 00:23:43,751
Like it's his duty

269
00:23:43,751 --> 00:23:45,126
Tries to impress her

270
00:23:45,293 --> 00:23:48,543
Makes some excuse...
touch, feel, hug, kiss

271
00:23:48,543 --> 00:23:51,293
lam a boy, I'll play my role

272
00:23:51,293 --> 00:23:53,501
I'll plot, create situations

273
00:23:53,793 --> 00:23:55,501
To hell with Corsica!

274
00:23:55,668 --> 00:23:59,918
Figure out how to touch you,
get physical

275
00:23:59,918 --> 00:24:04,501
Oh no! Then I'll have to play
Miss Touch-me-not

276
00:24:04,668 --> 00:24:07,626
Keep a safe distance from you

277
00:24:08,043 --> 00:24:12,210
Then I'll have to behave

278
00:24:13,043 --> 00:24:14,126
No.

279
00:24:14,126 --> 00:24:16,001
Hold myself back

280
00:24:16,418 --> 00:24:17,876
No, no

281
00:24:18,418 --> 00:24:21,001
Hold back? In Corsica?

282
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:22,293
What to do?

283
00:24:22,293 --> 00:24:24,626
Shame is a woman's wealth

284
00:24:29,293 --> 00:24:30,293
I won't...

285
00:24:30,293 --> 00:24:31,251
What?

286
00:24:31,251 --> 00:24:32,210
...be a rascal

287
00:24:32,668 --> 00:24:33,626
Move.

288
00:24:34,168 --> 00:24:38,335
Don't hold back. I'll be good

289
00:24:40,668 --> 00:24:41,835
You'll see

290
00:24:42,293 --> 00:24:43,876
I give you my word

291
00:24:43,876 --> 00:24:45,751
Understand?

292
00:24:46,543 --> 00:24:49,876
"As long as I breath, honey"

293
00:24:51,918 --> 00:24:54,418
My passport arrives in <i>7</i> days

294
00:24:54,418 --> 00:24:56,251
I'm here for a week

295
00:24:57,668 --> 00:24:59,751
I'll soon have cash

296
00:24:59,751 --> 00:25:01,626
I'll be broke by then

297
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:06,251
No introductions

298
00:25:07,293 --> 00:25:10,001
We could be anyone,
I don't know

299
00:25:11,543 --> 00:25:12,751
No talking?

300
00:25:14,501 --> 00:25:16,126
No talking the truth

301
00:25:18,793 --> 00:25:20,335
Let's promise

302
00:25:21,251 --> 00:25:24,751
We lie about our lives

303
00:25:26,043 --> 00:25:28,876
Speak nothing but lies

304
00:25:29,043 --> 00:25:32,751
And after Corsica,
we'll disappear. Magic!

305
00:25:33,168 --> 00:25:35,210
Never meet again

306
00:25:35,668 --> 00:25:39,585
A twist in the story.
A story like no other

307
00:25:40,043 --> 00:25:43,501
So whatever happens,
happens here

308
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:46,876
And what happens in Corsica...

309
00:25:47,543 --> 00:25:49,376
Stays in Corsica!

310
00:26:30,668 --> 00:26:33,418
Strolling down the open road

311
00:26:33,418 --> 00:26:35,751
Showing off big-time

312
00:26:35,918 --> 00:26:40,751
Hail rained down on me

313
00:26:40,751 --> 00:26:43,001
No umbrella to my rescue

314
00:26:43,168 --> 00:26:45,668
Can't decide

315
00:26:45,668 --> 00:26:48,751
Shall I run or get drenched?

316
00:26:48,918 --> 00:26:54,210
And then I thought,
dry up what's soaked

317
00:26:55,376 --> 00:26:57,751
Be it female or male

318
00:26:59,501 --> 00:27:00,126
Attention

319
00:27:00,293 --> 00:27:02,918
She played a new ruse

320
00:27:02,918 --> 00:27:04,876
And tricked me again

321
00:27:05,043 --> 00:27:07,501
Trapped me for no reason

322
00:27:07,668 --> 00:27:09,793
Curse you, O life

323
00:27:09,793 --> 00:27:12,085
She played a new ruse

324
00:27:12,543 --> 00:27:14,626
And tricked me again

325
00:27:14,626 --> 00:27:16,960
Trapped me for no reason

326
00:27:17,293 --> 00:27:18,876
Curse you, O life

327
00:27:18,876 --> 00:27:19,751
You know...

328
00:27:47,376 --> 00:27:48,751
You're the one

329
00:27:49,168 --> 00:27:53,585
I played tag with

330
00:27:53,918 --> 00:27:57,751
You're Laila, Shirin, Sohni, Juliet

331
00:27:57,751 --> 00:28:01,626
Don't seek me in the forest

332
00:28:01,626 --> 00:28:04,376
I am on WhatsApp

333
00:28:07,418 --> 00:28:10,251
This is not your era or my era

334
00:28:12,168 --> 00:28:14,585
Not female or male

335
00:28:16,168 --> 00:28:17,126
Take the bait

336
00:28:17,126 --> 00:28:19,335
She played a new ruse

337
00:28:19,668 --> 00:28:21,793
And tricked me again

338
00:28:21,793 --> 00:28:24,210
Trapped me for no reason

339
00:28:24,501 --> 00:28:26,251
Curse you, O life

340
00:28:40,126 --> 00:28:42,710
You're the one who...

341
00:28:43,126 --> 00:28:46,460
...tugged at my dhoti

342
00:28:46,751 --> 00:28:52,335
Where do you seek me?
I'm not in Kaaba or Kashi

343
00:28:52,751 --> 00:28:57,126
I am on Twitter

344
00:29:00,043 --> 00:29:04,251
Listen, O beloved

345
00:29:05,251 --> 00:29:08,751
My heart betrayed me

346
00:29:09,168 --> 00:29:13,751
When I set eyes on you

347
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:18,751
I lost all senses

348
00:29:19,043 --> 00:29:23,251
My weeping heart whispered

349
00:29:23,626 --> 00:29:28,001
My eyes now speak for me

350
00:29:28,293 --> 00:29:32,835
I see a new dream every day

351
00:29:33,876 --> 00:29:38,251
My restless heart cries out

352
00:29:38,543 --> 00:29:43,001
Don't hide behind that veil

353
00:29:43,418 --> 00:29:47,418
A devoted lover...

354
00:29:47,418 --> 00:29:52,043
...can only talk of love

355
00:29:52,043 --> 00:29:54,626
The heart may lament

356
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:55,751
So...

357
00:30:37,668 --> 00:30:39,793
Baby, I have news

358
00:30:39,793 --> 00:30:43,501
The gold will be hidden
behind the lighthouse

359
00:30:44,043 --> 00:30:46,626
And handed over to Don

360
00:30:46,793 --> 00:30:50,168
Gorgeous Mona Darling
is handling the transfer

361
00:30:50,168 --> 00:30:51,460
I'm sure you know the name

362
00:30:51,918 --> 00:30:53,001
Where's Teja?

363
00:30:53,293 --> 00:30:59,001
Still at his dentist's

364
00:30:59,001 --> 00:31:01,918
On behalf of Interpol,
I'll arrest the lot

365
00:31:01,918 --> 00:31:03,085
Unarmed

366
00:31:07,043 --> 00:31:10,251
The time is right, baby

367
00:31:11,293 --> 00:31:15,626
If you trust me, then follow me

368
00:31:20,918 --> 00:31:23,626
I wonder what secrets
are hidden in the case

369
00:31:23,793 --> 00:31:25,126
It's so heavy

370
00:31:25,418 --> 00:31:27,043
A little burden scares you?

371
00:31:27,043 --> 00:31:30,793
I'm from Interpol.
It's my duty to tell you

372
00:31:30,793 --> 00:31:34,835
Your beautiful valley is visible

373
00:32:27,418 --> 00:32:29,001
So now what?

374
00:32:29,668 --> 00:32:31,085
Meaning?

375
00:32:31,376 --> 00:32:33,876
Why did you call me here?
For sex, no?

376
00:32:34,168 --> 00:32:37,876
What utter nonsense!
I'm an Interpol officer

377
00:32:37,876 --> 00:32:40,126
Don't Interpol officers have a pole?

378
00:32:40,126 --> 00:32:41,876
Disgusting!

379
00:32:41,876 --> 00:32:43,626
Hear this

380
00:32:43,793 --> 00:32:46,251
Extras cost extra.
No whining later

381
00:32:46,668 --> 00:32:51,793
Extra for ***

382
00:32:51,793 --> 00:32:53,210
And I don-t ***

383
00:32:57,793 --> 00:33:00,251
How wonderful!

384
00:33:00,918 --> 00:33:03,460
Welcome to Corsica.

385
00:33:19,793 --> 00:33:20,960
Say it

386
00:33:21,751 --> 00:33:25,376
What is it? Why so sad?

387
00:33:26,251 --> 00:33:28,001
You're usually so cheerful

388
00:33:30,293 --> 00:33:33,126
Obviously, I know

389
00:33:37,918 --> 00:33:39,626
I see!

390
00:33:42,043 --> 00:33:44,001
A tunnel in my jail?

391
00:33:47,168 --> 00:33:48,210
Drop it

392
00:33:49,251 --> 00:33:50,876
Not here

393
00:33:53,043 --> 00:33:54,751
Home is OK

394
00:33:55,126 --> 00:33:58,626
Packed like sardines

395
00:33:59,918 --> 00:34:02,126
Do your own thing

396
00:34:02,126 --> 00:34:05,876
- I'm all yours
- Hand is God

397
00:34:06,793 --> 00:34:10,876
- Sister by day, wife by night
- Wife by night?

398
00:34:11,793 --> 00:34:17,001
- This bikini will slip off
- All B Grade

399
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:29,710
Yes!

400
00:35:44,543 --> 00:35:45,960
I see you..

401
00:36:47,793 --> 00:36:52,876
Excuse me... hi... Me parle-vous no French...
Can you help me please...?

402
00:36:52,876 --> 00:36:53,876
Yeah.

403
00:36:55,001 --> 00:36:58,376
And how you say;
Are you free this evening?

404
00:37:02,793 --> 00:37:03,876
Yes, correct.

405
00:37:15,626 --> 00:37:17,001
Come here!

406
00:37:18,293 --> 00:37:19,626
Hurry UP!

407
00:37:20,793 --> 00:37:22,210
Come on.

408
00:37:23,043 --> 00:37:25,001
Buy me a drink?
- Come on.

409
00:37:25,251 --> 00:37:28,126
And how do you say
"Will you take me out this evening".

410
00:37:29,668 --> 00:37:30,751
Excuse me.

411
00:37:35,668 --> 00:37:38,793
Welcome to India, Sambar-vada,
Medu-vada, Pav-vada

412
00:37:38,793 --> 00:37:40,835
Very, very nice. Namaste

413
00:37:56,043 --> 00:37:58,126
What must I do?
Beg on the streets?

414
00:37:58,668 --> 00:38:01,085
Beg for alms?

415
00:38:01,501 --> 00:38:04,751
You should've thought about
that before betting

416
00:38:05,876 --> 00:38:09,251
Look. Can you see an expensive
restaurant nearby?

417
00:38:09,793 --> 00:38:13,668
God, if only
You had made me a girl...

418
00:38:13,668 --> 00:38:18,626
...l would've sold my honour
to feed this glutton

419
00:38:18,918 --> 00:38:20,876
What do I do?

420
00:38:20,876 --> 00:38:22,585
Are you listening, God?

421
00:38:23,251 --> 00:38:25,876
You're too cool, God

422
00:38:31,293 --> 00:38:32,376
Come on.

423
00:38:33,668 --> 00:38:35,376
What's the plan?
- Don't know

424
00:38:37,918 --> 00:38:42,126
Padre. Padre.

425
00:38:43,626 --> 00:38:45,960
She's a movie star

426
00:38:46,376 --> 00:38:50,585
Madhubala making a picture
in Corsica

427
00:38:53,668 --> 00:38:55,418
Welcome. Please come.

428
00:38:55,418 --> 00:38:57,960
Please come.
Come, come, enjoy.

429
00:38:59,418 --> 00:39:01,001
Welcome.

430
00:39:01,418 --> 00:39:03,251
What a lovely dinner.

431
00:39:05,251 --> 00:39:06,376
Merci! Merci!

432
00:39:06,376 --> 00:39:10,251
But I will only be happy
if he cast me in his next movie.

433
00:39:11,918 --> 00:39:15,876
Mousier Director, why don't
you tell them about your latest story?

434
00:39:17,001 --> 00:39:17,876
You will..

435
00:39:18,501 --> 00:39:23,043
Bravo. Big Indian movie director
will tell you his latest story.

436
00:39:23,043 --> 00:39:24,751
Bravo. Bravo.

437
00:39:27,168 --> 00:39:30,418
And then he put the gun to his head.

438
00:39:30,418 --> 00:39:33,626
And he said I'm going to kill you,
prepare to die.

439
00:39:33,626 --> 00:39:35,751
And she said, Merci..

440
00:39:35,751 --> 00:39:40,126
Thank you God for
answering my prayers.

441
00:39:40,293 --> 00:39:42,251
For one year I tried to kill myself.

442
00:39:42,251 --> 00:39:45,168
I shoot myself 'Bang'...
and the chandelier fell.

443
00:39:45,168 --> 00:39:46,251
I miss..

444
00:39:46,251 --> 00:39:47,751
Then I take poison to die.

445
00:39:47,918 --> 00:39:50,751
Next morning
I wake up with hangover.

446
00:39:50,751 --> 00:39:53,335
Mama mia...then I cut my vein.

447
00:39:53,668 --> 00:39:54,918
I still no die.

448
00:39:54,918 --> 00:39:57,710
I get infection,
doctor give me seven injections.

449
00:39:58,543 --> 00:40:00,376
My ass is soar.

450
00:40:00,543 --> 00:40:02,501
Now God send you...

451
00:40:02,876 --> 00:40:07,001
Hurry up, kill me. Shoot me now.

452
00:40:07,251 --> 00:40:10,001
But wait...l have to pi-pi..

453
00:40:11,418 --> 00:40:13,626
First I pi-pi then you kill me.

454
00:40:13,626 --> 00:40:15,001
What does it matter?

455
00:40:15,168 --> 00:40:18,001
Once I die I have no pi-pi,
shoot me now.

456
00:40:18,168 --> 00:40:20,168
What if you kill me 'Boom'..

457
00:40:20,168 --> 00:40:22,210
...and I pee on your shoe.

458
00:40:22,543 --> 00:40:24,501
Ooh la-la...what a lovely shoe.

459
00:40:25,168 --> 00:40:26,376
What brand shoe?

460
00:40:26,376 --> 00:40:27,376
Jimmy-chu.

461
00:40:27,876 --> 00:40:29,126
Armani?

462
00:40:29,376 --> 00:40:30,626
I am tired of talking.

463
00:40:30,626 --> 00:40:31,626
Pardon me, where's the wine?

464
00:40:31,793 --> 00:40:33,126
Where?

465
00:40:35,043 --> 00:40:36,251
Salute.

466
00:40:43,668 --> 00:40:46,251
Pretty, pretty girls...
I've a message for you.

467
00:40:46,418 --> 00:40:49,168
This Madhubala,
she and me no together.

468
00:40:49,168 --> 00:40:51,168
No, no, no girlfriend.

469
00:40:51,168 --> 00:40:54,001
Yes...Madhubala...free.

470
00:40:54,001 --> 00:40:55,876
Madhubala available.

471
00:40:56,376 --> 00:41:00,876
And in my heart...
there is lot of love, amore.

472
00:41:00,876 --> 00:41:03,168
I want to give you love, come...

473
00:41:03,168 --> 00:41:04,126
Take it.

474
00:41:39,668 --> 00:41:43,376
Praise the Lord.
He has come to redeem us

475
00:41:43,376 --> 00:41:45,543
He has come to save us
from our foes

476
00:41:45,543 --> 00:41:48,626
Show mercy to our ancestors,
remember his Holy covenant

477
00:41:49,001 --> 00:41:50,501
Thank you very much

478
00:43:41,668 --> 00:43:42,585
What?

479
00:43:46,876 --> 00:43:48,126
Just looking

480
00:43:49,668 --> 00:43:53,335
That's allowed.
Remember our vow

481
00:43:54,376 --> 00:43:55,501
Why?

482
00:44:01,293 --> 00:44:02,085
See?

483
00:44:03,168 --> 00:44:04,460
That's all you get

484
00:44:06,543 --> 00:44:08,460
You upset?

485
00:44:09,168 --> 00:44:12,501
Your carnal desires
are weakening our oath

486
00:44:13,043 --> 00:44:14,376
What to do?

487
00:44:14,876 --> 00:44:18,751
Once we make a commitment

488
00:44:21,793 --> 00:44:24,001
Don't be disheartened, Princess

489
00:44:24,251 --> 00:44:27,251
Why just 'ting?
We can 'tong' too

490
00:44:31,626 --> 00:44:32,626
What a fun

491
00:44:32,626 --> 00:44:34,043
Fun has just begun, baby.

492
00:44:34,043 --> 00:44:35,626
There's more we can do

493
00:44:36,043 --> 00:44:37,376
For example

494
00:44:44,293 --> 00:44:47,001
ls this allowed?
- Why not?

495
00:44:49,043 --> 00:44:50,335
And even...

496
00:44:53,293 --> 00:44:54,626
...this is allowed

497
00:45:01,293 --> 00:45:02,710
Sure it's allowed?

498
00:45:03,126 --> 00:45:04,460
Why not? Why not?

499
00:45:05,293 --> 00:45:06,751
No crossing the line

500
00:45:09,168 --> 00:45:10,876
So can I do this?

501
00:45:17,001 --> 00:45:18,126
And this too

502
00:45:22,001 --> 00:45:23,876
The line is drawing close

503
00:45:25,293 --> 00:45:26,751
But we won't cross it

504
00:45:28,543 --> 00:45:29,751
Sure?

505
00:45:31,501 --> 00:45:34,376
I gave you my word

506
00:45:39,126 --> 00:45:42,876
I gave you my heart. And all
you gave me was your word

507
00:45:44,126 --> 00:45:47,376
This heart will mean nothing
in the next world, Zohra Bai

508
00:45:47,668 --> 00:45:48,751
Alas!

509
00:45:49,668 --> 00:45:54,585
Rules and regulations are
so different there

510
00:45:57,168 --> 00:45:58,460
What do we do?

511
00:46:00,543 --> 00:46:01,835
Shall we run away?

512
00:46:05,376 --> 00:46:07,251
Run! Run!

513
00:46:14,168 --> 00:46:16,251
Why does this always happen?

514
00:46:17,543 --> 00:46:19,876
Good times pass so quickly

515
00:46:21,001 --> 00:46:24,501
What if Sohni just never
returns home?

516
00:46:24,793 --> 00:46:26,126
Can she stay?

517
00:46:33,668 --> 00:46:34,835
A day early?

518
00:46:35,168 --> 00:46:38,001
There were a few phone-calls
from the ministry in New Delhi.

519
00:46:38,418 --> 00:46:40,335
You can tell me when
you want to fly out.

520
00:46:40,793 --> 00:46:42,251
There is a flight tomorrow.

521
00:46:57,543 --> 00:46:59,335
What time's the flight?

522
00:47:14,376 --> 00:47:15,751
Good bye.

523
00:47:20,626 --> 00:47:24,001
The airport is an hour away

524
00:47:45,168 --> 00:47:46,460
We'll never meet again

525
00:49:36,501 --> 00:49:39,043
Heer is very sad

526
00:49:39,043 --> 00:49:41,626
She's so upset these days

527
00:49:41,793 --> 00:49:44,376
Heer is very sad

528
00:49:44,376 --> 00:49:47,001
She's so upset these days

529
00:49:47,001 --> 00:49:49,376
Doesn't eat or drink

530
00:49:49,543 --> 00:49:51,876
Can't even complain

531
00:49:52,293 --> 00:49:57,085
The embers of love
have singed her

532
00:50:01,501 --> 00:50:06,751
How to face these embers again?

533
00:50:06,751 --> 00:50:13,001
Heer's state,
I swear by God

534
00:50:13,293 --> 00:50:16,043
ls a very bad state

535
00:50:16,043 --> 00:50:18,668
Heer is very sad

536
00:50:18,668 --> 00:50:21,251
She's so upset these days

537
00:50:21,251 --> 00:50:24,210
Heer is very sad

538
00:50:39,918 --> 00:50:43,168
Love is a matchstick,
the heart is diesel

539
00:50:43,168 --> 00:50:45,876
Best to keep them apart

540
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:48,418
Thorns piercing vision

541
00:50:48,418 --> 00:50:51,251
Shattering all dreams

542
00:50:53,751 --> 00:50:56,418
Heer's song is broken

543
00:50:56,418 --> 00:50:58,876
Who can enjoy the melody?

544
00:50:59,043 --> 00:51:01,751
She once spoke so freely

545
00:51:01,751 --> 00:51:04,293
Now utters not a word

546
00:51:04,293 --> 00:51:08,001
People say she's senile

547
00:51:11,376 --> 00:51:14,043
So utterly mad

548
00:51:14,043 --> 00:51:19,251
Heer is very sad

549
00:51:19,418 --> 00:51:22,626
She's so upset these days

550
00:52:20,668 --> 00:52:23,293
Her heart plays
a tuneless tune

551
00:52:23,293 --> 00:52:26,043
She looks pale

552
00:52:26,043 --> 00:52:31,626
Her mind is like
a pressure cooker

553
00:52:33,626 --> 00:52:36,501
To hell with life

554
00:52:36,668 --> 00:52:39,251
She sleeps to kill Time

555
00:52:39,251 --> 00:52:41,793
She blames Time

556
00:52:41,793 --> 00:52:44,543
Keeps punching it in the face

557
00:52:44,543 --> 00:52:48,335
Even her Dad is so worried now

558
00:52:51,043 --> 00:52:54,001
Mom is sad too

559
00:52:54,251 --> 00:52:56,668
Heer is really very mad

560
00:52:56,668 --> 00:52:59,418
Yes, she's very mad

561
00:52:59,418 --> 00:53:01,876
And none too glad too

562
00:53:02,043 --> 00:53:04,751
Doesn't eat or drink

563
00:53:04,751 --> 00:53:07,085
Can't even complain

564
00:53:07,418 --> 00:53:11,751
The embers of love have singed her

565
00:53:16,668 --> 00:53:21,918
How to face these embers again?

566
00:53:21,918 --> 00:53:28,418
Heer's state, I swear by God

567
00:53:28,418 --> 00:53:31,126
ls a very bad state

568
00:53:31,126 --> 00:53:33,876
Heer is very sad

569
00:53:33,876 --> 00:53:36,543
She's so upset these days

570
00:53:36,543 --> 00:53:39,376
Heer is very sad

571
00:55:26,918 --> 00:55:29,126
If you look at point
no.3 in the presentation..

572
00:55:29,126 --> 00:55:31,418
...you'll see that
for this strategy to work,

573
00:55:31,418 --> 00:55:33,168
we'll probably need
to get some expertise..

574
00:55:33,168 --> 00:55:34,876
...and hire some technical people.

575
00:55:35,043 --> 00:55:36,751
So I mean we should go back..

576
00:55:36,918 --> 00:55:38,001
Excuse me, please.
- Sure.

577
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:40,210
Excuse me. Excuse me.

578
00:55:41,751 --> 00:55:42,710
Hi.

579
00:55:45,626 --> 00:55:46,626
Remember?

580
00:55:47,793 --> 00:55:50,126
Corsica! Oh my, God.

581
00:55:50,126 --> 00:55:51,585
You? Here?

582
00:55:51,918 --> 00:55:55,126
I come here often.
You're from Delhi

583
00:55:56,418 --> 00:55:58,876
We decided never to meet again

584
00:56:00,918 --> 00:56:02,001
What now?

585
00:56:03,293 --> 00:56:04,710
What shall we do?

586
00:56:06,543 --> 00:56:07,835
Ved

587
00:56:08,876 --> 00:56:09,710
Ved?

588
00:56:10,418 --> 00:56:11,751
Like Rig Ved?

589
00:56:14,918 --> 00:56:16,126
Tara Maheshwari

590
00:56:16,668 --> 00:56:18,210
Ved Vardhan Sahni

591
00:56:18,543 --> 00:56:21,126
Your real name?

592
00:56:21,918 --> 00:56:23,376
The real me

593
00:56:24,668 --> 00:56:26,460
<i>Product Manager,
MGM Tech</i>

594
00:56:29,668 --> 00:56:30,835
Listen

595
00:56:31,918 --> 00:56:35,210
This is no coincidence.
I was pretending

596
00:56:35,793 --> 00:56:39,210
I've often come here
because I know you do

597
00:56:39,501 --> 00:56:42,501
I came to Delhi from Kolkata
on an assignment

598
00:56:44,918 --> 00:56:46,668
I couldn't stop myself

599
00:56:46,668 --> 00:56:49,376
Listen...don't. It's fine

600
00:56:49,543 --> 00:56:51,376
Really?
- Yeah, really.

601
00:56:51,793 --> 00:56:54,210
There's more

602
00:56:54,501 --> 00:56:55,585
Okay-

603
00:56:58,043 --> 00:57:00,626
Can we...
- Yeah.

604
00:57:00,876 --> 00:57:01,876
After you.

605
00:57:08,043 --> 00:57:11,626
You know since
I came back from Corsica...

606
00:57:13,626 --> 00:57:19,793
...l thought it'd be OK, usually is

607
00:57:19,793 --> 00:57:21,626
I don't know what it is

608
00:57:22,168 --> 00:57:24,293
All this love and all

609
00:57:24,293 --> 00:57:27,543
I thought how stupid I am

610
00:57:27,543 --> 00:57:31,960
Why do I always behave
like this with you?

611
00:57:40,043 --> 00:57:41,460
Your friends are waiting

612
00:57:44,293 --> 00:57:46,626
Give me 5 minutes?
- Sure

613
00:57:47,168 --> 00:57:48,126
Okay..

614
00:57:50,876 --> 00:57:52,001
Listen..

615
00:57:52,543 --> 00:57:56,501
Don't psych yourself out.
I'm not a crazy stalker

616
00:57:56,751 --> 00:57:59,126
I promise you, I won't pile on

617
00:57:59,293 --> 00:58:03,251
I know you have a life.
Probably a girlfriend too

618
00:58:05,793 --> 00:58:07,001
I don't have a girlfriend

619
00:58:07,543 --> 00:58:08,835
Oh, okay.

620
00:58:10,668 --> 00:58:11,626
Five minutes

621
00:58:14,293 --> 00:58:15,501
You did well

622
00:58:17,876 --> 00:58:18,876
Be right back

623
00:59:12,293 --> 00:59:13,376
Hi.
- Hi.

624
00:59:14,168 --> 00:59:16,210
Looking great?
- Really?

625
00:59:17,001 --> 00:59:18,876
Of course.
- Thank you.

626
00:59:19,668 --> 00:59:21,001
I'll put this at the back

627
00:59:32,293 --> 00:59:33,335
Thank you.

628
00:59:34,043 --> 00:59:34,876
Thank you.

629
00:59:35,168 --> 00:59:36,251
Thank you.

630
00:59:37,168 --> 00:59:37,751
Thanks.

631
00:59:37,918 --> 00:59:39,876
Would you like regular
or mineral water, ma'am?

632
00:59:39,876 --> 00:59:41,418
Room temperature or cold, sir.

633
00:59:41,418 --> 00:59:43,085
Bisleri or aviola.

634
00:59:47,001 --> 00:59:52,710
So...here we are.
- Yeah.

635
00:59:55,043 --> 00:59:56,335
Place is fine?

636
00:59:57,918 --> 00:59:59,626
Yeah... Very nice...

637
01:00:00,126 --> 01:00:01,710
I'm glad...

638
01:00:05,168 --> 01:00:07,043
For the last two years...

639
01:00:07,043 --> 01:00:10,710
...it's won Timeout's Best
Oriental Restaurant title

640
01:00:11,293 --> 01:00:12,585
Yeah.

641
01:00:17,418 --> 01:00:20,126
Japanese cuisine is so popular, no?

642
01:00:21,168 --> 01:00:23,960
What a brand. Japan!

643
01:00:28,168 --> 01:00:31,626
Countries are the latest companies,
and Companies are the latest Countries.

644
01:00:36,918 --> 01:00:38,251
Have some.

645
01:00:46,793 --> 01:00:48,126
So...

646
01:00:50,293 --> 01:00:51,876
I'll call you tomorrow

647
01:00:53,501 --> 01:00:54,501
Great

648
01:00:55,168 --> 01:00:56,126
At s?

649
01:00:58,418 --> 01:00:59,626
You OK?

650
01:01:00,293 --> 01:01:01,960
Yeah! Why?

651
01:01:02,168 --> 01:01:03,626
No, just asking.

652
01:01:10,168 --> 01:01:11,585
Would you like to come up?

653
01:01:13,793 --> 01:01:14,960
Let me.

654
01:01:30,793 --> 01:01:32,960
Nice place.
- Thank you.

655
01:01:36,043 --> 01:01:38,460
There are four apartments like this?

656
01:01:44,543 --> 01:01:45,335
SQ?

657
01:01:46,543 --> 01:01:47,376
SQ?

658
01:01:59,251 --> 01:02:01,501
Sony, did it hurt?

659
01:02:02,501 --> 01:02:03,501
One sec...

660
01:02:09,418 --> 01:02:10,751
I am sorry.

661
01:02:14,543 --> 01:02:16,085
I put it on silent

662
01:02:20,043 --> 01:02:21,210
Okay-

663
01:02:47,043 --> 01:02:48,460
Shah Rukh Khan!

664
01:02:51,918 --> 01:02:53,085
Please...please...

665
01:02:54,043 --> 01:02:55,376
Thank you..

666
01:03:01,168 --> 01:03:01,793
Good morning.

667
01:03:01,793 --> 01:03:04,335
Good morning.
- Good morning.

668
01:03:04,918 --> 01:03:06,001
Good morning, sir.

669
01:03:06,376 --> 01:03:07,376
Good morning, sir!

670
01:03:07,751 --> 01:03:10,001
The CSB focus
of the recent tradewinds..

671
01:03:10,001 --> 01:03:12,918
...rests in the lateral
shift of consumer behavior..

672
01:03:12,918 --> 01:03:16,751
...which may appear bi-polar, but it
does not take an Einstein to co-relate..

673
01:03:16,751 --> 01:03:18,626
Granted that we cannot
un-google ourselves..

674
01:03:18,793 --> 01:03:21,793
...from the geometrical
growth of social-media.

675
01:03:21,793 --> 01:03:23,251
Why do you get nervous?

676
01:03:24,668 --> 01:03:27,043
Next time don't get nervous.
- Okay, sir.

677
01:03:27,043 --> 01:03:29,501
You can do it, boy.
- Thank you, sir.

678
01:03:29,876 --> 01:03:30,876
Thank you.

679
01:03:38,376 --> 01:03:39,126
Hello.

680
01:03:40,418 --> 01:03:41,460
Hi.

681
01:03:42,543 --> 01:03:43,626
Good.

682
01:03:45,543 --> 01:03:49,751
My plan?
You'll decide that

683
01:03:54,418 --> 01:03:55,376
Okay-

684
01:04:03,251 --> 01:04:05,876
So this is it, huh!

685
01:04:07,251 --> 01:04:09,376
This is what they say...
love and all.

686
01:04:14,418 --> 01:04:15,585
I love you too.

687
01:04:22,168 --> 01:04:23,626
Why are we standing?
Everyone's waiting...

688
01:04:23,626 --> 01:04:25,001
Come, $0..

689
01:04:45,543 --> 01:04:48,001
Hero, nothing today?

690
01:04:56,168 --> 01:04:57,001
Good morning, sir.

691
01:04:57,168 --> 01:04:58,126
Good morning, sir.

692
01:04:58,126 --> 01:04:59,626
I would say Glo-cal.

693
01:05:00,168 --> 01:05:01,460
Global, yet local.

694
01:05:01,918 --> 01:05:03,126
This out-of-the-box strategy..

695
01:05:03,293 --> 01:05:05,001
...follows a bottom-upward approach.

696
01:05:05,376 --> 01:05:07,460
Yet has a 360 perspective...

697
01:05:10,751 --> 01:05:12,668
So, how was it, sir?

698
01:05:12,668 --> 01:05:13,751
Good, could be better.

699
01:05:13,918 --> 01:05:15,876
Always a pleasure to have you.
Please come back soon.

700
01:05:15,876 --> 01:05:17,251
Please tell the driver
to come by in half an hour.

701
01:05:17,251 --> 01:05:18,626
Sir.
- Yes, boy.

702
01:05:19,126 --> 01:05:20,085
Tara

703
01:05:20,501 --> 01:05:24,251
I won't say meet my "boss."
I'd say meet my "guru"

704
01:05:24,793 --> 01:05:26,001
Hello.
- Hello.

705
01:05:26,418 --> 01:05:31,751
Everything MCMTech Telecom is today,
is thanks to this man

706
01:05:32,918 --> 01:05:34,126
One man army.

707
01:05:34,626 --> 01:05:38,376
His vision, his philosophy has
changed the face of Indian telecom.

708
01:05:39,001 --> 01:05:39,960
Totally.

709
01:05:41,376 --> 01:05:44,210
Good human in today times

710
01:05:45,001 --> 01:05:46,376
Keep it up, boy)!

711
01:06:02,751 --> 01:06:08,626
Happy birthday to you.

712
01:06:08,793 --> 01:06:11,876
Happy birthday Dear Ved.

713
01:06:12,168 --> 01:06:14,710
Happy birthday to you.

714
01:06:15,168 --> 01:06:17,126
Guys, she's coming.

715
01:06:44,543 --> 01:06:46,001
One sec, Ved.

716
01:06:48,501 --> 01:06:50,501
Can we step out for a minute?

717
01:06:58,501 --> 01:06:59,626
What's wrong?

718
01:06:59,626 --> 01:07:01,126
Just come out, please.

719
01:07:12,793 --> 01:07:14,001
Excuse us...

720
01:07:32,793 --> 01:07:33,751
Yeah.

721
01:07:38,793 --> 01:07:43,501
Ved, since I've returned
from Corsica...

722
01:07:45,376 --> 01:07:46,501
It's like..

723
01:07:48,293 --> 01:07:49,835
It's like you're with me

724
01:07:54,043 --> 01:07:55,251
You understand?

725
01:07:57,751 --> 01:07:59,501
I don't know your name

726
01:08:01,168 --> 01:08:06,710
No hope we'd meet again.
But I am with you

727
01:08:08,668 --> 01:08:12,210
ls it possible? To feel like this?

728
01:08:15,126 --> 01:08:16,501
I never knew

729
01:08:19,626 --> 01:08:21,460
Then you found me

730
01:08:22,793 --> 01:08:23,626
No

731
01:08:25,293 --> 01:08:29,376
I found a product manager
who lives in a city

732
01:08:29,751 --> 01:08:34,126
Who is very well behaved.
Polite, decent

733
01:08:37,376 --> 01:08:38,126
But...

734
01:08:40,793 --> 01:08:45,126
Tara, I am a product manager.
I do live in a city

735
01:08:46,293 --> 01:08:48,126
I am not Don, Tara

736
01:08:49,626 --> 01:08:51,626
Nor a movie director

737
01:08:54,043 --> 01:08:57,251
That was play-acting.
Role playing

738
01:08:58,293 --> 01:09:02,501
This is the real me

739
01:09:02,751 --> 01:09:04,126
No

740
01:09:05,293 --> 01:09:06,251
Meaning?

741
01:09:06,543 --> 01:09:11,626
You're Don,
and the Interpol officer

742
01:09:12,543 --> 01:09:14,501
You're acting here

743
01:09:15,793 --> 01:09:19,001
Now you're playing the role of
a regular guy

744
01:09:20,043 --> 01:09:22,001
Who follows a set pattern

745
01:09:22,418 --> 01:09:28,376
Who does things as he ought to.
It's not you, Ved

746
01:09:29,793 --> 01:09:31,335
All fake

747
01:09:33,418 --> 01:09:37,085
You stick your face in the
river and drink like a beast

748
01:09:37,918 --> 01:09:40,876
You talk to the mountains.
That's you, Ved

749
01:09:43,251 --> 01:09:44,751
What's with you?

750
01:09:49,626 --> 01:09:51,126
What's with you, Tara?

751
01:09:54,668 --> 01:10:01,210
Who is that? He's no one.
It's all in your head

752
01:10:03,293 --> 01:10:06,710
Maybe you have imagined
that's me

753
01:10:08,418 --> 01:10:09,876
This is me, Tara

754
01:10:11,293 --> 01:10:14,001
Standing here before you

755
01:10:14,376 --> 01:10:15,626
This is all I am

756
01:10:19,293 --> 01:10:20,501
Sure?

757
01:10:20,501 --> 01:10:21,501
Tara.

758
01:10:22,001 --> 01:10:24,085
Yes, I am sure, Tara

759
01:10:32,126 --> 01:10:34,126
Then I'm with someone else, Ved

760
01:10:37,293 --> 01:10:38,626
I am looking for something else

761
01:10:41,293 --> 01:10:43,001
I already have this

762
01:10:46,543 --> 01:10:48,251
I don't want this

763
01:10:56,418 --> 01:10:57,501
It's a mess now

764
01:11:00,918 --> 01:11:02,376
Everything is ruined

765
01:11:05,168 --> 01:11:06,460
But it's happened

766
01:12:12,793 --> 01:12:16,501
Hi... So I am back...

767
01:12:20,501 --> 01:12:23,918
There are things we must sort out

768
01:12:26,251 --> 01:12:27,668
It's like this...

769
01:12:29,960 --> 01:12:31,251
It's fine, okay...?

770
01:12:31,585 --> 01:12:33,793
Please... let's relax...

771
01:12:36,501 --> 01:12:37,793
It's okay...

772
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:41,793
Let's order the main course

773
01:12:43,585 --> 01:12:44,585
Excuse me...

774
01:12:57,793 --> 01:13:01,001
Look, boss, you've two options

775
01:13:03,543 --> 01:13:05,126
Become Majnu

776
01:13:05,626 --> 01:13:07,918
Rip your clothes off and scream

777
01:13:09,251 --> 01:13:10,960
Or stay cool

778
01:13:13,751 --> 01:13:17,293
You know what...I'll stay cool

779
01:13:18,001 --> 01:13:21,168
Yeah... It's all good.

780
01:13:23,876 --> 01:13:25,668
It wasn't going to work

781
01:13:26,751 --> 01:13:28,710
What had to happen -
happens now

782
01:13:29,835 --> 01:13:31,418
It's fine

783
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:34,251
No tension now

784
01:13:36,460 --> 01:13:37,501
Good.

785
01:13:39,043 --> 01:13:40,126
Set.

786
01:13:47,043 --> 01:13:48,376
Hey Raj-U...

787
01:13:51,918 --> 01:13:53,460
Good Morning... good morning...

788
01:13:53,751 --> 01:13:54,626
Good Morning...

789
01:13:54,626 --> 01:13:55,710
How are things?

790
01:14:05,043 --> 01:14:07,876
We're going to the movies tonight

791
01:14:08,418 --> 01:14:09,710
Coming?

792
01:14:09,710 --> 01:14:12,751
We'll have a beer later

793
01:14:13,376 --> 01:14:14,626
Where?

794
01:14:15,668 --> 01:14:18,418
At the same pub we went to
after your breakup?

795
01:14:20,376 --> 01:14:21,793
Why not why not...?

796
01:14:22,418 --> 01:14:25,251
My girl dumped me.
Something good must happen

797
01:14:26,085 --> 01:14:27,251
Keep me amused!

798
01:14:28,335 --> 01:14:29,418
That's right.

799
01:14:32,210 --> 01:14:35,585
I was waiting for you to feel better

800
01:14:36,043 --> 01:14:37,751
But you look perfectly fine

801
01:14:38,126 --> 01:14:39,168
So here

802
01:14:39,585 --> 01:14:41,710
You forgot this at the restaurant

803
01:14:43,918 --> 01:14:45,460
Saved me thousands

804
01:14:46,835 --> 01:14:49,376
Never seen him this happy

805
01:14:49,376 --> 01:14:50,918
Someone help me break up too

806
01:14:50,918 --> 01:14:53,126
No problem
- And me!

807
01:14:59,751 --> 01:15:01,543
Sony, it's very late

808
01:15:02,043 --> 01:15:03,126
It's okay..

809
01:15:03,126 --> 01:15:04,418
But I was just...

810
01:15:05,376 --> 01:15:06,585
Come in
- No

811
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:10,793
I won't take time. I was thinking...

812
01:15:16,501 --> 01:15:20,168
I mean...you...instead of...

813
01:15:27,501 --> 01:15:28,793
Ved, look at me

814
01:15:30,751 --> 01:15:31,918
What is it?

815
01:15:34,001 --> 01:15:35,376
Tell me Ved...

816
01:15:35,793 --> 01:15:38,543
It's not what you think

817
01:15:39,710 --> 01:15:41,793
Nothing important
- Then say it

818
01:15:42,543 --> 01:15:43,293
Okay

819
01:15:43,293 --> 01:15:46,293
You see it was different in Corsica

820
01:15:46,293 --> 01:15:50,376
We promised we'd lie.
Here you didn't have to

821
01:15:50,376 --> 01:15:51,585
What?
- The truth!

822
01:15:52,210 --> 01:15:55,376
You could've told me the truth

823
01:16:00,251 --> 01:16:02,626
Ved, come inside
- I'm not here to come inside

824
01:16:02,626 --> 01:16:06,293
You should've said I was not
on your level

825
01:16:06,793 --> 01:16:07,293
Ved...

826
01:16:07,293 --> 01:16:11,335
I don't know what you thought
of me in Corsica. But here?

827
01:16:11,626 --> 01:16:14,168
You know what I am

828
01:16:14,168 --> 01:16:16,293
A normal person. Ordinary

829
01:16:16,293 --> 01:16:17,335
Ved, one second

830
01:16:18,418 --> 01:16:20,418
I'm ordinary
- That's the issue, Ved

831
01:16:20,418 --> 01:16:23,293
I am average. Like them all

832
01:16:23,293 --> 01:16:26,210
Walking on the street, with briefcase

833
01:16:26,210 --> 01:16:27,543
Ved...
- Mediocre

834
01:16:27,543 --> 01:16:31,168
That's what I said, Ved.
You're not that

835
01:16:31,168 --> 01:16:32,501
I know who you are

836
01:16:32,501 --> 01:16:35,418
B*! You know, but no one else does

837
01:16:35,418 --> 01:16:38,376
My family, friends.
Don't know myself, but you...

838
01:16:38,376 --> 01:16:41,376
7 days in Corsica,
you've sussed me

839
01:16:56,418 --> 01:16:58,293
No it's not fine Tara...

840
01:16:58,876 --> 01:16:59,835
How could I?

841
01:17:00,293 --> 01:17:03,085
It's good to let it out

842
01:17:03,085 --> 01:17:05,043
What's there to let out?

843
01:17:06,460 --> 01:17:08,626
Ved, just come.
- I am very sorry

844
01:17:09,543 --> 01:17:10,751
I'm really really sorry.

845
01:17:10,751 --> 01:17:12,585
Let it go Ved... It's fine...

846
01:17:13,085 --> 01:17:14,793
Come inside

847
01:17:14,793 --> 01:17:17,501
I shouldn't come inside

848
01:17:17,793 --> 01:17:20,751
I didn't come here to patch up

849
01:17:21,293 --> 01:17:23,335
No sense standing out here

850
01:17:23,918 --> 01:17:26,376
It's late. People must be asleep

851
01:17:27,001 --> 01:17:31,376
I'll wake them because I'm nuts.
I'll scream, make a racket

852
01:17:31,376 --> 01:17:32,751
Make a scene

853
01:17:32,751 --> 01:17:34,626
Take me inside. Hide me

854
01:17:34,626 --> 01:17:37,126
Anything to control this beast

855
01:17:59,001 --> 01:18:03,793
You're my life

856
01:18:03,793 --> 01:18:08,251
You're my ivy

857
01:18:10,876 --> 01:18:13,376
Hairstyle is terrific, boss

858
01:18:14,876 --> 01:18:16,126
Hairstyle

859
01:18:16,460 --> 01:18:17,710
Hairstyle

860
01:18:19,293 --> 01:18:23,585
Joining the movies?
- I wanted to

861
01:18:24,626 --> 01:18:26,043
Sure, I did

862
01:18:26,418 --> 01:18:29,043
Do it. What's the problem?

863
01:18:30,793 --> 01:18:32,460
Only one problem

864
01:18:33,543 --> 01:18:34,585
Circumstances

865
01:18:35,626 --> 01:18:40,251
Parents did their duty,
got me married

866
01:18:40,793 --> 01:18:43,668
I did the needful, had two kids

867
01:18:44,210 --> 01:18:46,751
The wheel of time turns

868
01:18:47,210 --> 01:18:51,918
Food, children's education,
wife's demands

869
01:18:52,251 --> 01:18:53,793
The traffic, this rickshaw

870
01:18:54,793 --> 01:18:56,585
You wanted to act?

871
01:18:58,710 --> 01:18:59,835
To sing

872
01:19:02,460 --> 01:19:04,960
You couldn't guess from my looks

873
01:19:05,793 --> 01:19:09,376
But when I sang on stage
in Allahabad...

874
01:19:10,085 --> 01:19:11,793
...the audience went crazy

875
01:19:13,126 --> 01:19:15,585
They wouldn't let me stop

876
01:19:17,001 --> 01:19:18,460
So you're a hero

877
01:19:19,751 --> 01:19:21,085
No, sir

878
01:19:21,085 --> 01:19:22,793
I'm just a rickshaw driver

879
01:19:24,710 --> 01:19:28,085
Not a damn soul knows me

880
01:19:30,168 --> 01:19:34,418
Inside, I am another man.
Outside, I'm powerless

881
01:19:41,793 --> 01:19:43,501
Maths

882
01:19:44,626 --> 01:19:46,293
I don't get Maths

883
01:19:47,543 --> 01:19:48,960
Can't get the hang of it

884
01:19:49,835 --> 01:19:50,751
Go on

885
01:19:51,418 --> 01:19:55,585
I don't want to study
engineering, actually

886
01:19:56,710 --> 01:19:57,751
It's not me, Papa

887
01:19:58,376 --> 01:20:01,126
I am not interested. So...

888
01:20:02,793 --> 01:20:06,085
When your grandpa came
here after the Partition...

889
01:20:07,376 --> 01:20:08,501
...he had zero

890
01:20:10,418 --> 01:20:12,335
No roof over his head

891
01:20:12,876 --> 01:20:15,585
And a family of 8 to feed

892
01:20:16,210 --> 01:20:21,001
If he had said: "I'm not
interested in working in a factory

893
01:20:21,751 --> 01:20:25,251
"lt's not me,
actually, I want to play the flute"

894
01:20:26,001 --> 01:20:29,376
Could the family have survived?

895
01:20:30,043 --> 01:20:33,335
Would you have the chance
of doing engineering?

896
01:20:34,460 --> 01:20:36,918
After two years of training...

897
01:20:36,918 --> 01:20:40,251
...you couldn't even pass the
entrance exam

898
01:20:40,793 --> 01:20:43,126
You wasted a year at home

899
01:20:43,626 --> 01:20:46,668
You're getting admission now
thanks to my donation

900
01:20:47,210 --> 01:20:51,876
You should be grateful.
Work harder out of shame

901
01:20:53,085 --> 01:20:54,710
But what interests you?

902
01:20:55,335 --> 01:20:59,626
Sitting under trees, telling stories
at 10- rupees an hour

903
01:21:00,085 --> 01:21:01,668
Want to be a movie star?

904
01:21:02,335 --> 01:21:07,960
What is your career plan?
Speak up!

905
01:21:17,960 --> 01:21:26,793
Locking eyes
with dazzling damsels

906
01:21:27,668 --> 01:21:33,460
Trying to lure lovely chicks

907
01:21:37,210 --> 01:21:45,626
Locking eyes
with dazzling damsels

908
01:21:46,835 --> 01:21:54,876
Trying to lure lovely chicks

909
01:21:55,668 --> 01:21:56,835
O beauty...

910
01:21:57,251 --> 01:22:02,501
Doing my duty, hitting on you

911
01:22:05,793 --> 01:22:09,043
I've left decency behind

912
01:22:09,043 --> 01:22:12,085
Inviting trouble on myself

913
01:22:12,418 --> 01:22:20,001
I'm in hot water, thanks to you

914
01:22:23,626 --> 01:22:31,960
Locking eyes
with dazzling damsels

915
01:22:33,460 --> 01:22:37,918
Trying to lure lovely chicks

916
01:22:54,418 --> 01:23:00,835
Spending time talking
about you to myself

917
01:23:00,835 --> 01:23:04,210
Laughing to myself,
crying to myself

918
01:23:04,210 --> 01:23:07,418
Torturing myself

919
01:23:07,418 --> 01:23:14,043
They all mock me because
of you

920
01:23:14,043 --> 01:23:21,168
Me? Who strutted about proudly

921
01:23:28,418 --> 01:23:31,376
What next? The usual

922
01:23:32,668 --> 01:23:36,793
The same old story.
Majnu rips off his clothes

923
01:23:36,793 --> 01:23:38,751
Makes a scene in public

924
01:23:39,251 --> 01:23:48,460
Thinking to himself:
"Why...where...sunny...money"

925
01:23:49,668 --> 01:23:52,043
Without money, how would it be?

926
01:23:52,501 --> 01:23:55,835
Just think! Forget boring facts

927
01:23:55,835 --> 01:23:57,668
Be happy, eat well

928
01:23:57,668 --> 01:23:59,668
Lock horns, walk the gallows.
Tear your clothes, untie knots

929
01:23:59,668 --> 01:24:02,918
Whip the cream, tell the tale

930
01:24:02,918 --> 01:24:06,876
Entertain them all.
Make noise, shake hips

931
01:24:07,668 --> 01:24:12,126
Pour out the silver and gold
of your heart. I surrender to you

932
01:24:12,835 --> 01:24:13,835
Just for you

933
01:24:14,543 --> 01:24:19,668
Your slave, master, wearing a tie.
In the lift, coming to you

934
01:24:19,668 --> 01:24:22,251
Doing again what I do
every day

935
01:24:22,668 --> 01:24:25,710
Doing it again and again
and again

936
01:24:27,043 --> 01:24:31,168
Sometimes it's your story.
Sometimes another's

937
01:24:31,918 --> 01:24:33,543
What's in your heart?

938
01:24:34,210 --> 01:24:39,293
The color of your heart?
What does it seek?

939
01:24:40,251 --> 01:24:41,335
Tell me

940
01:24:42,168 --> 01:24:43,210
Answer me

941
01:24:44,710 --> 01:24:47,793
Sorry, Papa
- No, son, my donation

942
01:24:49,251 --> 01:24:51,835
You realise, that's enough

943
01:24:53,043 --> 01:24:54,918
lam proud of you my son...

944
01:24:55,793 --> 01:24:59,001
I know you'll do well in college

945
01:24:59,668 --> 01:25:00,876
All the best...

946
01:25:04,460 --> 01:25:10,751
The flowers in your hair have
robbed the very life from me

947
01:25:10,751 --> 01:25:16,668
Your every move has ensnared me

948
01:25:16,668 --> 01:25:23,626
Tell me where are you
leading me

949
01:25:23,626 --> 01:25:30,168
Slowly but surely
you've done me in

950
01:25:30,168 --> 01:25:38,418
Locking eyes
with dazzling damsels

951
01:25:39,751 --> 01:25:48,293
Trying to lure lovely chicks

952
01:25:49,376 --> 01:25:57,835
Locking eyes
with dazzling damsels

953
01:26:12,835 --> 01:26:15,501
I pray you get your dream girl

954
01:26:16,668 --> 01:26:17,793
Thank you

955
01:26:21,251 --> 01:26:22,376
Good morning

956
01:26:23,376 --> 01:26:24,376
Morning

957
01:26:27,418 --> 01:26:28,376
Good morning sir

958
01:26:30,418 --> 01:26:31,585
Where's your tie?

959
01:26:32,585 --> 01:26:33,918
Forgot it?

960
01:26:34,751 --> 01:26:35,960
Tiwari

961
01:26:36,668 --> 01:26:38,085
It's okay boss...

962
01:26:38,460 --> 01:26:39,501
It's okay...?

963
01:26:40,668 --> 01:26:41,751
It's okay...?

964
01:26:44,710 --> 01:26:47,460
We're hardly selling the tie

965
01:26:49,043 --> 01:26:50,168
Put it on!

966
01:26:52,335 --> 01:26:54,168
Gone nuts, all for a girl

967
01:26:55,543 --> 01:26:56,710
Hurry <i>up...---</i>

968
01:26:57,835 --> 01:27:01,751
...it is finally our core values
that will harness the seismic shift

969
01:27:01,751 --> 01:27:04,710
because technology epiphanies
are not a result of a packed like sardines

970
01:27:04,710 --> 01:27:07,626
Eureka Moment they
are systematically produced

971
01:27:07,626 --> 01:27:09,460
and the Devil is in the detail
what difference does it mane

972
01:27:09,460 --> 01:27:12,626
plus the Blue Ocean Strategy
is call it what you want IP driven

973
01:27:12,626 --> 01:27:15,251
and favors the backward
integration process

974
01:27:15,251 --> 01:27:17,418
Why, sir? I wasn't nervous today

975
01:27:17,418 --> 01:27:18,793
Not the point

976
01:27:20,751 --> 01:27:22,210
The client looks happy

977
01:27:22,460 --> 01:27:25,918
You were talking crazy stuff

978
01:27:26,501 --> 01:27:27,835
Crazy stuff?

979
01:27:31,710 --> 01:27:33,251
Anyway...
- Okay sir

980
01:27:34,001 --> 01:27:34,918
Anyway...

981
01:27:35,835 --> 01:27:38,710
and sector agnostic though
it looks from the outside,

982
01:27:38,710 --> 01:27:41,043
from the inside it
is not only hello hello Charlie

983
01:27:41,043 --> 01:27:44,418
consistent to our corporate
DNA but also organic to the

984
01:27:44,418 --> 01:27:46,793
new drivers of economy
Patparganj and since...

985
01:27:46,793 --> 01:27:48,626
all points of convergence
are known to us-

986
01:27:49,335 --> 01:27:51,043
Very amused, right?

987
01:27:52,251 --> 01:27:54,543
Yes!

988
01:27:56,418 --> 01:27:58,335
You know you'll get sc

989
01:27:59,210 --> 01:28:00,293
Badly

990
01:28:01,710 --> 01:28:03,835
You'll get sc*

991
01:28:07,168 --> 01:28:08,293
Bastard

992
01:28:11,210 --> 01:28:12,376
It's come to this

993
01:28:14,668 --> 01:28:17,293
Went nuts over a girl

994
01:29:22,835 --> 01:29:23,710
Ved..

995
01:29:23,710 --> 01:29:24,626
Hi, Tara

996
01:29:24,626 --> 01:29:26,835
Sorry, I saw your missed calls

997
01:29:27,210 --> 01:29:30,835
How are you?
- Absolutely fine. You?

998
01:29:31,251 --> 01:29:32,626
Can we meet?

999
01:29:33,168 --> 01:29:34,335
Why?

1000
01:29:34,335 --> 01:29:35,501
I want to see you

1001
01:29:36,376 --> 01:29:38,210
That's not why I called

1002
01:29:39,210 --> 01:29:41,126
I just wanted to apologise

1003
01:29:41,126 --> 01:29:42,876
I want to see you, Ved

1004
01:29:43,126 --> 01:29:45,626
What is it? I'm fine

1005
01:29:47,626 --> 01:29:49,043
Where are you now, Ved?

1006
01:29:49,043 --> 01:29:50,210
Can I come over?

1007
01:29:51,376 --> 01:29:53,335
I'll wait, if you're busy

1008
01:29:54,293 --> 01:29:55,251
OK

1009
01:30:12,043 --> 01:30:12,960
Hi

1010
01:30:13,585 --> 01:30:15,043
Oh, hi

1011
01:30:18,460 --> 01:30:19,793
Dicey, eh?

1012
01:30:21,960 --> 01:30:24,418
Should we? Yes, no?

1013
01:30:30,001 --> 01:30:31,085
Better

1014
01:30:37,168 --> 01:30:39,376
Hello, how are you?

1015
01:30:41,001 --> 01:30:42,960
I won't do anything crazy

1016
01:30:43,543 --> 01:30:47,001
What did I do the other day?

1017
01:30:50,001 --> 01:30:50,960
Ved...

1018
01:30:53,710 --> 01:30:56,126
I came here to tell you
it's my fault

1019
01:30:57,710 --> 01:30:58,668
HOW?

1020
01:30:59,668 --> 01:31:01,251
Because you rejected me?

1021
01:31:02,251 --> 01:31:06,793
Because I said something...

1022
01:31:08,001 --> 01:31:09,710
...acting too smart

1023
01:31:11,376 --> 01:31:13,876
It disturbed you

1024
01:31:14,668 --> 01:31:18,501
I think I touched a raw nerve
in you

1025
01:31:19,793 --> 01:31:21,335
I want to say sorry

1026
01:31:25,460 --> 01:31:26,543
Then say it

1027
01:31:29,960 --> 01:31:31,085
Say $0")!

1028
01:31:33,543 --> 01:31:35,210
Go on, say it

1029
01:31:38,085 --> 01:31:39,585
What are you?

1030
01:31:40,460 --> 01:31:43,418
A psychiatrist?
Am I your patient?

1031
01:31:43,418 --> 01:31:44,293
I'm concerned

1032
01:31:44,293 --> 01:31:46,251
That's mighty helpful

1033
01:31:46,251 --> 01:31:47,043
Wow!

1034
01:31:47,043 --> 01:31:49,085
I'm feeling well these days

1035
01:31:49,085 --> 01:31:50,626
Great, thanks

1036
01:31:50,626 --> 01:31:52,626
Ved, I'm sorry

1037
01:31:54,335 --> 01:31:58,293
I take back everything I said
to you the other day

1038
01:32:01,085 --> 01:32:03,293
Where's the ring? I want it

1039
01:32:10,210 --> 01:32:13,043
Everyone can see how happy I am

1040
01:32:15,043 --> 01:32:16,210
Ved.

1041
01:32:16,751 --> 01:32:18,335
Don't get physical

1042
01:32:18,626 --> 01:32:21,835
Leave it, Tara
- Please, Ved, sit down

1043
01:32:23,418 --> 01:32:25,626
You're in love, crazy girl

1044
01:32:26,960 --> 01:32:30,001
Yes, Ved

1045
01:32:30,793 --> 01:32:32,335
But with someone else

1046
01:32:33,710 --> 01:32:38,043
You belong to someone else,
O muse of poetry

1047
01:32:39,001 --> 01:32:40,418
Tara, listen

1048
01:32:40,751 --> 01:32:44,210
I can't predict my reactions

1049
01:32:44,210 --> 01:32:47,126
So I'll go
- What have I done wrong?

1050
01:32:47,126 --> 01:32:48,460
Sorry

1051
01:32:50,126 --> 01:32:52,126
You're so great, Tara

1052
01:32:52,793 --> 01:32:56,960
I could worship you

1053
01:33:01,085 --> 01:33:02,001
See...

1054
01:33:02,501 --> 01:33:06,335
...what I become
when I'm around you?

1055
01:33:06,960 --> 01:33:08,793
Your negativity

1056
01:33:08,793 --> 01:33:10,418
Ved, it's a passing phase

1057
01:33:10,418 --> 01:33:13,626
It'll be fine
- Stay away from me

1058
01:33:13,876 --> 01:33:15,085
I might do something

1059
01:33:15,085 --> 01:33:17,376
That's the problem

1060
01:33:18,210 --> 01:33:19,876
I can't stay away from you

1061
01:33:21,251 --> 01:33:23,210
Betraying your true love?

1062
01:33:23,210 --> 01:33:25,210
Ved seriously...

1063
01:33:25,210 --> 01:33:26,626
No, seriously, Tara

1064
01:33:26,626 --> 01:33:29,293
You're compromising. Right?

1065
01:33:30,210 --> 01:33:31,793
Wait. Don will return

1066
01:33:32,251 --> 01:33:34,126
He'll come back some day

1067
01:33:34,126 --> 01:33:35,210
Wait for him

1068
01:33:35,585 --> 01:33:36,918
Ved
- Tara

1069
01:33:36,918 --> 01:33:39,210
I promise I'll make things right

1070
01:33:39,210 --> 01:33:41,960
Don't you get it? Let me go

1071
01:33:41,960 --> 01:33:43,626
I won't let you go

1072
01:33:50,293 --> 01:33:54,043
Stay still, let the moment pass

1073
01:33:54,043 --> 01:33:57,960
Let the heart settle

1074
01:33:58,501 --> 01:34:05,085
But how do I stop you?

1075
01:34:05,793 --> 01:34:13,501
My sorrows would slip away

1076
01:34:14,085 --> 01:34:20,085
If you let me fill my eyes
with you

1077
01:34:21,418 --> 01:34:28,376
Talk to you without words

1078
01:34:28,710 --> 01:34:34,210
If you were by my side

1079
01:34:36,293 --> 01:34:40,751
If you were by my side

1080
01:34:56,501 --> 01:35:01,960
Flowing as one

1081
01:35:05,043 --> 01:35:07,626
Like a lake and river

1082
01:35:09,043 --> 01:35:20,043
Your world makes my world

1083
01:35:20,668 --> 01:35:27,251
I will mould myself in your image

1084
01:35:27,251 --> 01:35:31,668
If you were by my side

1085
01:35:31,668 --> 01:35:35,543
Your eyes hold your dreams

1086
01:35:35,543 --> 01:35:39,501
Dreams full of disappointment

1087
01:35:39,501 --> 01:35:43,418
You believe that feelings
of the heart...

1088
01:35:43,418 --> 01:35:47,251
are merely deceitful words

1089
01:35:47,251 --> 01:35:51,251
If you were or not by my side

1090
01:35:51,251 --> 01:35:55,043
Doesn't matter

1091
01:35:55,043 --> 01:35:59,043
Life was cruel

1092
01:35:59,043 --> 01:36:02,418
And still is

1093
01:36:02,418 --> 01:36:06,751
If you were by my side

1094
01:36:06,751 --> 01:36:10,168
Let the heart settle

1095
01:36:10,168 --> 01:36:13,835
If you were by my side

1096
01:36:14,626 --> 01:36:17,876
Every sorrow would slip-away

1097
01:36:17,876 --> 01:36:22,460
If you were by my side

1098
01:36:22,460 --> 01:36:25,626
These days would pass

1099
01:36:25,626 --> 01:36:30,001
If you were by my side

1100
01:37:31,626 --> 01:37:33,418
ls it all right, boss?

1101
01:37:34,001 --> 01:37:35,043
Okay sir.

01:37:36,168 --> 01:37:38,418
I'm returning the diamond ring

1104
01:37:38,418 --> 01:37:40,876
It can't lose value

1105
01:37:40,876 --> 01:37:43,376
Charge the next buyer

1106
01:37:43,376 --> 01:37:44,585
You have no heart

1107
01:37:45,293 --> 01:37:46,918
Good morning

1108
01:37:47,376 --> 01:37:49,043
Good morning
- Good morning sir

1109

Good morning

1112
01:37:55,376 --> 01:37:56,793
What's wrong with him?

1113
01:38:00,876 --> 01:38:03,585
Give me something!

1114
01:38:04,293 --> 01:38:05,293
Hey hero!

1115
01:38:20,043 --> 01:38:21,418
God bless you...

1116
01:38:21,751 --> 01:38:23,376
such a kind man...

01:39:05,168 --> 01:39:06,918
Something's wrong

1128
01:39:06,918 --> 01:39:09,460
Sure, something's wrong

1129
01:39:10,751 --> 01:39:14,543
But sir, this job is all I have

1130
01:39:15,418 --> 01:39:16,751
I don't want to lose it, sir

1131
01:39:19,668 --> 01:39:23,460
Listen, boy, your behavior is
always A- 1

1132
01:39:24,251 --> 01:39:28,793
Your work is average.
Yet you survived all these years

1133
01:39:29,501 --> 01:39:31,251
Only on good behaviour

1134
01:39:32,126 --> 01:39:36,251
You're decent,
polite, nice...everyone likes you

1135
01:39:36,710 --> 01:39:38,126
And you're doing this?

1136
01:39:39,251 --> 01:39:40,751
All for that girl

1137
01:39:42,126 --> 01:39:44,168
What is there so much in
that girl?

1138
01:39:47,835 --> 01:39:50,751
Everyone has a weak moment

1139
01:39:52,168 --> 01:39:53,960
Even I do

1140
01:39:58,418 --> 01:40:02,168
I have a weak moment.
So what do I do?

1141
01:40:03,626 --> 01:40:05,293
I put in more effort

1142
01:40:05,668 --> 01:40:07,710
More focus, focus!

1143
01:40:09,626 --> 01:40:11,126
And you've a bright future

1144

Just improve your work

You could be the Company's

1148
01:40:22,626 --> 01:40:24,918
...you may have my seat

1149
01:40:25,168 --> 01:40:26,251
Yes, why not?

1150
01:40:26,543 --> 01:40:29,126
In 15 years you could be like me

1151
01:40:29,543 --> 01:40:31,918
Oh, s* No!

1152
01:40:31,918 --> 01:40:34,001
It is possible

1153
01:40:34,001 --> 01:40:38,293
Impossible! Tell me it's a lie

1154
01:40:42,751 --> 01:40:44,001
No!

1155
01:40:52,960 --> 01:40:55,085
You're going to yell again

1156
01:41:01,543 --> 01:41:02,918
Now go for it, boy

1157
01:41:05,668 --> 01:41:06,793
Send security

1158
01:41:23,126 --> 01:41:29,168
I was very wrong.
Can you forgive me?

1159
01:41:31,751 --> 01:41:32,918
Tell me. Say it

1160
01:41:33,668 --> 01:41:35,210
Can you forgive me?

1161
01:41:36,251 --> 01:41:38,043
Please sir!

1162
01:41:40,751 --> 01:41:42,543
Will you forgive me or not?

1163
01:41:53,376 --> 01:41:55,793
Go on, forgive me

Won't you forgive me?

1166
01:42:06,168 --> 01:42:09,043
Security! Throw this man
out of the office

1167
01:42:12,293 --> 01:42:16,501
I'll ruin you, ruin you

01:42:49,793 --> 01:42:59,001
The beauty is here to face
punishment for loving him

1169
01:43:04,043 --> 01:43:10,960
May no one throw a stone...
at my crazed one

1170
01:43:18,668 --> 01:43:20,710
What's happening, boss?

1171
01:43:28,168 --> 01:43:32,918
Please I beg you

01:43:43,835 --> 01:43:47,168
Hello... How are you Ved buddy?

1175
01:43:47,168 --> 01:43:48,043
Fine...

1176
01:43:48,043 --> 01:43:51,501
So wonderful to see you.
You're fine...? Hmm...?

1177
01:43:51,501 --> 01:43:53,293
Are you OK? All good?

1178
01:43:53,293 --> 01:43:55,126
Actually, no, I'm not fine

1179
01:43:55,501 --> 01:43:59,126
In a bad way. I've been fired

1180
01:43:59,418 --> 01:44:03,418
Security threw me out.
So I sit at home all day

1181
01:44:03,418 --> 01:44:07,335
I wake up at nights, anxious,
in a sweat

1182
01:44:07,335 --> 01:44:09,626
I had my appendix operated

1183
01:44:10,085 --> 01:44:12,168
It's been leaking ever since

1184
01:44:12,168 --> 01:44:17,168
And fungus is growing
inside my body

1185
01:44:17,168 --> 01:44:21,960
The scrotum? In Hindi it's...?
- I don't know

1186
01:44:22,418 --> 01:44:26,001
Algae in my scrotum

1187
01:44:27,126 --> 01:44:30,543
I know it doesn't happen,
it's all psychological

1188
01:44:30,543 --> 01:44:33,960
What are you doing?
- He asked

1189
01:44:33,960 --> 01:44:35,251
Four times

1190
01:44:35,251 --> 01:44:37,668
Everyone says:
"How are you?"

1191
01:44:39,085 --> 01:44:40,876
Why? They don't want to know

1192
01:44:41,168 --> 01:44:42,335
Very funny

1193
01:44:43,876 --> 01:44:46,293
I'll tell you

1194
01:44:46,751 --> 01:44:49,793
I swear I tell you today

1195
01:44:49,793 --> 01:44:51,460
Let me go...

1196
01:44:53,251 --> 01:44:55,543
He's mad...
He assaulted me...

1197
01:44:57,168 --> 01:45:00,210
He is dangerous... He can't
be walking around like this...

1198
01:45:25,876 --> 01:45:32,668
You are someone else

1199
01:45:34,085 --> 01:45:38,668
You know it

1200
01:45:39,876 --> 01:45:46,001
The world...

1201
01:45:47,585 --> 01:45:51,501
...sees only a mask

1202
01:45:53,501 --> 01:45:57,751
You are someone else

1203
01:45:58,585 --> 01:46:01,876
Be who you truly are

1204
01:46:03,293 --> 01:46:14,001
Why aren't you what you really are

1205
01:46:18,251 --> 01:46:28,043
Don't forget your true self
for the sake of the world

1206
01:46:29,876 --> 01:46:39,710
Do not torment yourself

1207
01:46:40,668 --> 01:46:50,501
Remove the shackles you have tied

1208
01:46:51,043 --> 01:47:00,418
Tell the world you are another

1209
01:47:02,293 --> 01:47:03,418
Tara!

1210
01:47:11,585 --> 01:47:12,835
Which star?

1211
01:47:14,251 --> 01:47:15,585
Heading where?

1212
01:47:16,418 --> 01:47:21,085
Where does my heart lead me?

1213
01:47:21,626 --> 01:47:23,001
Without my walking

1214
01:47:25,710 --> 01:47:30,460
The princess of my dreams
stands far away

1215
01:47:30,793 --> 01:47:33,585
Unreal. A mirage

1216
01:47:34,835 --> 01:47:37,543
Looks like water but is sand

1217
01:47:38,251 --> 01:47:39,960
Why make the effort?

1218
01:47:40,876 --> 01:47:43,293
She's worthless. Why bother?

1219
01:47:43,835 --> 01:47:46,251
Sacrifice everything for nothing?

1220
01:47:47,251 --> 01:47:52,168
Who wants gold and pearls
of the heart? Who cares...

1221
01:47:52,918 --> 01:47:54,210
...what's inside

1222
01:47:55,210 --> 01:47:58,418
Looks like water but is sand

1223
01:48:02,085 --> 01:48:06,918
Speak to him calmly
- Of course I will

1224
01:48:07,251 --> 01:48:08,293
What do you mean?

1225
01:48:10,710 --> 01:48:12,293
Come...

1226
01:48:14,293 --> 01:48:15,376
Come, son

1227
01:48:16,835 --> 01:48:18,335
How long will you stay?

1228
01:48:19,168 --> 01:48:20,668
A day or two

1229
01:48:21,626 --> 01:48:24,001
That's all? Only for a day or two?

1230
01:48:24,460 --> 01:48:25,668
Can't you extend your leave?

1231
01:48:31,918 --> 01:48:32,960
What's wrong?

1232
01:48:34,501 --> 01:48:35,501
Nothing

1233
01:48:37,876 --> 01:48:40,960
I am not working
- You quit your job?

1234
01:48:41,376 --> 01:48:42,710
Working elsewhere?

1235
01:48:48,043 --> 01:48:49,168
How long has it been?

1236
01:48:50,668 --> 01:48:51,876
It's been...

1237
01:48:53,543 --> 01:48:54,793
A few days

1238
01:48:54,793 --> 01:48:57,918
Two days, a month?
- Six months

1239
01:48:58,835 --> 01:49:00,543
Papa, don't worry

1240
01:49:00,876 --> 01:49:04,293
Six months
Doing what for six months?

1241
01:49:05,001 --> 01:49:07,626
What's wrong with you, Ved?

1242
01:49:07,626 --> 01:49:10,501
Ma, don't make a scene
- She's making a scene?

1243
01:49:11,168 --> 01:49:13,668
Idle for six months

1244
01:49:13,668 --> 01:49:17,293
Look at your face! You look like
a drug addict

1245
01:49:17,293 --> 01:49:18,626
I'll leave today

1246
01:49:21,085 --> 01:49:22,210
I'll go back, Papa

1247
01:49:22,543 --> 01:49:25,543
You'll repeat the same things

1248
01:49:25,543 --> 01:49:28,710
Remind me of my duty.
When will I be responsible?

1249
01:49:28,710 --> 01:49:30,251
Think it pleases me?

1250
01:49:30,668 --> 01:49:32,960
Repeating the same things
over and over

1251
01:49:33,168 --> 01:49:38,293
You're on the wrong path.
I have to drag you back

1252
01:49:39,501 --> 01:49:42,210
OK, Papa. I'll pack my bags

1253
01:49:42,960 --> 01:49:45,335
Am I your enemy?

1254
01:49:45,335 --> 01:49:46,960
No need for that

1255
01:49:47,543 --> 01:49:50,710
I'm my own enemy.
Ruining myself

1256
01:49:50,710 --> 01:49:52,376
That's true

1257
01:49:53,043 --> 01:49:54,710
Now you've said it

1258
01:49:55,335 --> 01:49:58,501
People without problems,
create problems

1259
01:49:59,001 --> 01:50:01,085
Never faced bad times

1260
01:50:02,418 --> 01:50:03,335
Cool...

1261
01:50:03,668 --> 01:50:04,668
Super...

1262
01:50:05,376 --> 01:50:07,085
I'll pack my stuff

1263
01:50:20,376 --> 01:50:23,585
Done? What now?

1264
01:50:25,668 --> 01:50:28,543
I am going beyond the mountains

1265
01:50:29,085 --> 01:50:33,460
Today I'll find out if the gypsies
found water

1266
01:50:34,543 --> 01:50:37,710
Get out of the world of stories,
you idiot

1267
01:50:39,376 --> 01:50:45,168
Think of yourself. What will
become of your life?

1268
01:50:45,626 --> 01:50:50,043
Who knows? Only the storyteller
knows what will happen

1269
01:50:50,043 --> 01:50:51,501
He'll tell me

1270
01:51:08,751 --> 01:51:11,501
An old man used to sit here years ago

1271
01:51:40,418 --> 01:51:41,835
Tell me a story

1272
01:51:44,335 --> 01:51:45,793
A story

1273
01:51:46,751 --> 01:51:49,960
I have money. Loads of it

1274
01:51:59,793 --> 01:52:02,751
The girl says to the boy:
"You're not whom I thought you were

1275
01:52:03,335 --> 01:52:07,835
"I thought you were free, but
you're stuck." She goes

1276
01:52:08,501 --> 01:52:11,460
The boy is shaken.
He starts behaving oddly

1277
01:52:11,793 --> 01:52:16,668
He's fired. He's all alone.
What happens next?

1278
01:52:17,668 --> 01:52:20,210
He's bound to his fate

1279
01:52:26,585 --> 01:52:33,210
The boy leaves the city for the
forest, lives among the beasts

1280
01:52:33,210 --> 01:52:37,501
He talks to the trees, laughs loudly

1281
01:52:38,001 --> 01:52:42,668
Seeks Laila in all things.
In every speck

1282
01:52:42,668 --> 01:52:46,126
This is not Majnu's story.
It's Ved's story

1283
01:52:46,126 --> 01:52:47,168
who?

1284
01:52:47,585 --> 01:52:49,376
Ved. Me

1285
01:52:50,293 --> 01:52:52,960
This boy lives in the city.
Not the forest

1286
01:52:54,835 --> 01:53:00,126
He finds everything disagreeable

1287
01:53:00,585 --> 01:53:01,376
Correct

1288
01:53:01,918 --> 01:53:06,376
People around him
are suspicious of him

1289
01:53:06,751 --> 01:53:10,918
They get mad at him.
Call him useless and crazy

1290
01:53:11,335 --> 01:53:13,418
He calls them crazy.

1291
01:53:13,751 --> 01:53:16,460
They are nasty to him

1292
01:53:17,085 --> 01:53:20,001
He cries out: "lt's my right."

1293
01:53:20,001 --> 01:53:20,835
Stop!

1294
01:53:20,835 --> 01:53:24,418
They bury him alive between
two walls

1295
01:53:24,418 --> 01:53:27,335
The Emperor says:
"Take the wretch away

1296
01:53:27,335 --> 01:53:30,085
"Throw him off the highest tower

1297
01:53:30,085 --> 01:53:32,793
"So Heer shan't see him again"
- Listen!

1298
01:53:32,793 --> 01:53:34,460
Heer cries loudly

1299
01:53:34,460 --> 01:53:37,126
Where is my Lord Ram?

1300
01:53:37,126 --> 01:53:41,501
Ravaan, standing among
the crowd of devotees...

1301
01:53:41,501 --> 01:53:43,293
What are you blabbering?

1302
01:53:43,293 --> 01:53:45,085
I asked something

1303
01:53:45,085 --> 01:53:46,543
What are you asking?

1304
01:53:46,543 --> 01:53:49,168
About my story

1305
01:53:49,168 --> 01:53:51,960
Who are you?
Why are you here?

1306
01:53:51,960 --> 01:53:53,668
What happens in my story?

1307
01:53:53,668 --> 01:53:56,335
You're a thief. Throw him out

1308
01:53:57,168 --> 01:53:58,210
Calm down, Baba

1309
01:53:58,210 --> 01:54:01,960
What happens next?
- What did you come to steal?

1310
01:54:02,460 --> 01:54:05,543
We have no diamonds or
cures or God

1311
01:54:05,835 --> 01:54:07,210
Calm down, Baba

1312
01:54:07,210 --> 01:54:09,126
He's senile
- What happens next?

1313
01:54:09,501 --> 01:54:16,168
You're scared.
You ask me for your story. Coward!

1314
01:54:18,210 --> 01:54:21,460
Who do you fear? Who is here?

1315
01:54:23,751 --> 01:54:25,793
You tell me what happens next

1316
01:54:26,210 --> 01:54:28,501
Tell your story

1317
01:54:29,376 --> 01:54:31,960
What's in your heart?

1318
01:54:32,751 --> 01:54:34,460
What do you want?

1319
01:54:38,876 --> 01:54:40,585
What do I want?

1320
01:54:44,918 --> 01:54:49,501
Heer is in your heart but you
seek her in the wilderness

1321
01:54:51,168 --> 01:54:54,710
imposter. Cheat!

1322
01:54:56,418 --> 01:54:58,918
Get out!

1323
01:54:59,251 --> 01:55:02,251
I said get out

1324
01:55:02,501 --> 01:55:04,251
Call the police

1325
01:55:04,751 --> 01:55:07,085
He's an imposter, a thief

1326
01:55:07,085 --> 01:55:08,376
He's gone.
- Call the police.

1327
01:55:33,835 --> 01:55:39,876
The story of this journey

1328
01:55:40,501 --> 01:55:47,751
Replete with questions

1329
01:55:48,585 --> 01:55:51,251
It starts with you

1330
01:55:52,626 --> 01:55:56,085
It ends with you

1331
01:55:56,543 --> 01:56:00,876
The story of this journey

1332
01:56:04,626 --> 01:56:16,126
The one I sought...

1333
01:56:17,793 --> 01:56:23,335
...sought everywhere
was deep within me

1334
01:56:24,543 --> 01:56:31,835
The story of this journey.
Replete with answers

1335
01:56:33,085 --> 01:56:41,501
A step taken towards you.
Soon we shall meet

1336
01:56:59,835 --> 01:57:00,835
Hi

1337
01:57:01,710 --> 01:57:02,626
Hello

1338
01:57:02,918 --> 01:57:04,293
What happened?

1339
01:57:04,293 --> 01:57:05,376
Nothing

1340
01:57:05,710 --> 01:57:07,460
You said you were leaving

1341
01:57:07,793 --> 01:57:10,335
I didn't. This is my father's house

1342
01:57:15,251 --> 01:57:17,626
Papa, can I tell you a story?

1343
01:57:20,293 --> 01:57:22,585
Yes, go ahead

1344
01:57:37,793 --> 01:57:42,043
Many years ago when India
was Partitioned

1345
01:57:43,043 --> 01:57:45,460
There was a man who lived
in Lahore

1346
01:57:46,085 --> 01:57:48,126
His name was the Hero

1347
01:57:50,376 --> 01:57:52,543
The fire of Partition
spread ferociously

1348
01:57:52,543 --> 01:57:55,751
The Hero had to bring
his family to India

1349
01:57:58,251 --> 01:58:00,668
He left his riches behind

1350
01:58:00,960 --> 01:58:03,626
In one night,
our hero became a zero

1351
01:58:04,751 --> 01:58:08,835
Sorry, mistake. He didn't become
a zero, he's the hero

1352
01:58:09,668 --> 01:58:11,418
He worked in a wood mill

1353
01:58:11,418 --> 01:58:13,043
He worked hard.

1354
01:58:13,376 --> 01:58:16,751
Started his own business,
built a beautiful house

1355
01:58:17,585 --> 01:58:20,543
Next came his son,
the new hero

1356
01:58:22,126 --> 01:58:25,376
Worked hard too,
grew the business

1357
01:58:25,376 --> 01:58:28,835
He got a job. Educated
his children well

1358
01:58:28,835 --> 01:58:31,085
Added rooms to the old house

1359
01:58:32,168 --> 01:58:33,876
And then came his son

1360
01:58:34,543 --> 01:58:36,043
Now this is our hero

1361
01:58:37,251 --> 01:58:41,960
He tried management,
engineering, office work

1362
01:58:41,960 --> 01:58:46,085
Say yes, look down,
happy and sad

1363
01:58:50,335 --> 01:58:55,918
One day many miles away,
between the heart and world

1364
01:58:56,710 --> 01:58:58,168
Our hero found a companion

1365
01:59:05,251 --> 01:59:06,835
Who said: "Hi"

1366
01:59:07,251 --> 01:59:08,918
Our hero said: "Hello"

1367
01:59:09,210 --> 01:59:11,835
The companion asked:
How are you?

1368
01:59:12,168 --> 01:59:15,210
Our hero said: Fine, thank you.
How are you?

1369
01:59:15,585 --> 01:59:18,710
The companion asked:
Why are you talking like this?

1370
01:59:19,293 --> 01:59:20,293
HOW?

1371
01:59:21,085 --> 01:59:23,335
You sound like a machine

1372
01:59:24,001 --> 01:59:25,210
Meaning?

1373
01:59:25,835 --> 01:59:28,876
Wait. Where are you going?

1374
01:59:29,168 --> 01:59:31,835
I cannot stop. If I stop, I will die

1375
01:59:33,001 --> 01:59:34,043
Die?

1376
01:59:34,710 --> 01:59:36,918
Iam running a race

1377
01:59:38,918 --> 01:59:42,126
What race do you run?
- I don't know

1378
01:59:43,043 --> 01:59:45,835
You don't know,
so why are you running?

1379
01:59:46,376 --> 01:59:50,293
Everyone is running.
So that's why I am running

1380
01:59:53,376 --> 01:59:56,210
Why is everyone running?
Does no one stop to ask?

1381
01:59:56,543 --> 01:59:58,960
What? Why?

1382
01:59:59,376 --> 02:00:00,710
"What's that?"

1383
02:00:01,126 --> 02:00:02,251
What's that?

1384
02:00:02,668 --> 02:00:05,293
Why?

1385
02:00:06,043 --> 02:00:07,210
Our very own "Why?"

1386
02:00:07,210 --> 02:00:08,668
You don't know why

1387
02:00:09,043 --> 02:00:11,293
You seem to have
dialed the wrong number,

1388
02:00:12,501 --> 02:00:13,835
Forget it

1389
02:00:14,293 --> 02:00:16,001
What difference which race

1390
02:00:16,376 --> 02:00:17,585
As long as you're winning

1391
02:00:17,835 --> 02:00:20,376
I'm sure you always win

1392
02:00:21,460 --> 02:00:22,376
Come second?

1393
02:00:22,918 --> 02:00:23,793
No

1394
02:00:24,251 --> 02:00:26,293
Third?
- No

1395
02:00:26,876 --> 02:00:30,293
Fourth, fifth, sixth,
seventh, eighth?

1396
02:00:30,293 --> 02:00:31,251
Ninth?

1397
02:00:31,251 --> 02:00:33,585
'You seemed to have
dialed the wrong number.'

1398
02:00:33,585 --> 02:00:38,418
Train no. 721...
Stop. Forget password.

1399
02:00:39,043 --> 02:00:40,835
Insurance is a subject
matter of solicitation.

1400
02:00:40,835 --> 02:00:42,876
Please read the offer document
carefully before investing.

1401
02:00:46,793 --> 02:00:49,335
You're somewhere in the middle

1402
02:00:50,251 --> 02:00:51,543
The middle-man

1403
02:00:52,251 --> 02:00:56,751
Yes, I'm mediocre

1404
02:00:57,376 --> 02:01:00,210
You're so proud to be mediocre

1405
02:01:03,293 --> 02:01:05,793
Can I say something?

1406
02:01:07,376 --> 02:01:09,251
I don't think you're ordinary

1407
02:01:10,460 --> 02:01:13,293
When I'm with you I feel special

1408
02:01:13,293 --> 02:01:14,835
Imagine how special you are

1409
02:01:15,543 --> 02:01:18,626
I've never met anyone like you

1410
02:01:19,835 --> 02:01:23,210
Don't you think you're special?

1411
02:01:24,168 --> 02:01:25,710
Sorry, wrong number.

1412
02:01:26,043 --> 02:01:29,126
What? Did no one tell you?

1413
02:01:30,085 --> 02:01:32,293
That reminds the hero of something

1414
02:01:32,668 --> 02:01:33,668
He says:

1415
02:01:34,085 --> 02:01:38,168
"There was someone
who said I was special"

1416
02:01:38,835 --> 02:01:41,168
That's right
Who was it?

1417
02:01:41,168 --> 02:01:44,501
He was a snake
- A snake?

1418
02:01:44,501 --> 02:01:47,751
Yes! He talked rot

1419
02:01:47,751 --> 02:01:51,210
You're full of wonder!
A mine of diamonds

1420
02:01:52,710 --> 02:01:53,751
Damn imposter

1421
02:01:54,251 --> 02:01:56,168
Know his name?

1422
02:01:56,710 --> 02:01:58,793
His name was...

1423
02:01:59,335 --> 02:02:00,460
Childhood

1424
02:02:02,085 --> 02:02:03,168
My childhood

1425
02:02:03,168 --> 02:02:06,126
Childhood? Meaning, brother?

1426
02:02:06,126 --> 02:02:07,501
Are you mad?

1427
02:02:07,501 --> 02:02:10,168
Childhood was a poisonous snake

1428
02:02:10,168 --> 02:02:12,668
Slithering in the garden

1429
02:02:12,668 --> 02:02:14,043
Hiding behind bushes

1430
02:02:14,043 --> 02:02:17,251
Hood raised, ready to strike

1431
02:02:18,085 --> 02:02:20,293
Destroyed him when I grew up

1432
02:02:21,293 --> 02:02:22,793
Crushed him underfoot

1433
02:02:23,501 --> 02:02:28,210
I put my foot on his damn neck
and pressed hard

1434
02:02:29,043 --> 02:02:31,001
Destroyed

1435
02:02:34,710 --> 02:02:39,001
Now it's OK. Now no one says
I am special

1436
02:02:39,543 --> 02:02:42,043
I can live my life comfortably now

1437
02:02:42,460 --> 02:02:46,251
Walk, stop, smile please, mediocre...

1438
02:02:46,626 --> 02:02:49,293
Nonsense! A mistake

1439
02:02:49,960 --> 02:02:53,335
Choose your race. See if you
come first or not

1440
02:02:53,668 --> 02:02:55,126
You'll come first

1441
02:02:55,126 --> 02:02:57,668
Guaranteed. Stop!
- I cannot stop

1442
02:02:58,085 --> 02:02:59,668
Look at yourself

1443
02:03:00,335 --> 02:03:01,751
Know who you are

1444
02:03:02,043 --> 02:03:05,376
One day the world will know you.
Open your eyes

1445
02:03:05,710 --> 02:03:08,043
I won't open my eyes, I won't stop

1446
02:03:08,043 --> 02:03:10,710
I'll keep running the race.
I'll keep running

1447
02:03:10,710 --> 02:03:12,001
I'll stay mediocre

1448
02:03:12,001 --> 02:03:15,501
Average. Work, stop, smile please.

1449
02:03:18,251 --> 02:03:22,335
So our hero ran the race for
the rest of his life

1450
02:03:22,960 --> 02:03:24,418
And one day he died

1451
02:03:25,960 --> 02:03:27,126
Story over

1452
02:03:27,418 --> 02:03:29,751
Why?
- What's "why?"

1453
02:03:34,293 --> 02:03:35,668
So how was the story?

1454
02:03:39,126 --> 02:03:40,210
Papa?

1455
02:03:45,001 --> 02:03:46,293
The end's bad?

1456
02:03:50,293 --> 02:03:51,460
Bad ending

1457
02:03:54,126 --> 02:03:58,043
It's my story. We'll change the end

1458
02:04:01,751 --> 02:04:05,460
This is who I am, papa.
This is who I am.

1459
02:04:07,210 --> 02:04:10,210
I am no good at Maths. I'm sorry

1460
02:04:13,626 --> 02:04:18,710
The last hero is the best.
My favourite

1461
02:04:26,918 --> 02:04:30,668
I'll come first in this race. I know

1462
02:04:30,668 --> 02:04:32,460
I know you will, son

1463
02:04:32,460 --> 02:04:35,543
Will you keep hugging each other?

1464
02:04:35,543 --> 02:04:37,210
Tell us the new end

1465
02:04:38,793 --> 02:04:40,418
What happens next?

1466
02:04:46,668 --> 02:04:49,126
No one has ever given me
such a big gift

1467
02:04:49,668 --> 02:04:52,293
I was so happy

1468
02:04:53,085 --> 02:04:54,710
But what will I do with it?

1469
02:04:55,001 --> 02:04:58,626
The ring will fulfill
all your heart's desires

1470
02:04:59,043 --> 02:04:59,876
You'll see

1471
02:05:18,210 --> 02:05:21,918
When souls unite,
how long can bodies stay apart?

1472
02:05:22,835 --> 02:05:27,668
Ranjha, wander in forest or mountain.
Befriend the wilderness

1473
02:05:28,168 --> 02:05:32,085
You'll find your path.
Your feet will start moving

1474
02:05:32,085 --> 02:05:36,293
And one day Ranjha will reach
Heer's abode

1475
02:05:59,501 --> 02:06:02,293
Looking forward,
to the second part of your speech.

1476
02:06:02,293 --> 02:06:02,876
Thank you.

1477
02:06:02,876 --> 02:06:06,585
The discussion on the bipolar behavior
of the metropolitan consumer..

1478
02:07:23,835 --> 02:07:26,335
Stay cool, be normal.

1479
02:07:27,335 --> 02:07:30,793
They're watching us.
Keep walking

1480
02:07:35,418 --> 02:07:37,876
So you got the diamond consignment?

1481
02:07:41,835 --> 02:07:42,835
Oh, by the way.

1482
02:07:43,626 --> 02:07:47,668
Don 2!

1483
02:07:48,543 --> 02:07:51,918
The police from 12 countries
are looking for me...

1484
02:07:53,918 --> 02:07:57,418
...and I am at a corporate's,
settling an old score

1485
02:07:59,293 --> 02:08:00,293
And you?

1486
02:08:02,043 --> 02:08:04,668
Me
- Yes, you

1487
02:08:05,335 --> 02:08:06,626
You must be someone

1488
02:08:08,335 --> 02:08:09,918
Me?

1489
02:08:11,835 --> 02:08:13,210
Mata Hari

1490
02:08:14,001 --> 02:08:16,668
Must have heard the name

1491
02:08:17,751 --> 02:08:22,335
So should I call you Mata...or Hari?

1492
02:08:23,543 --> 02:08:28,668
Don't call me anything,
just listen

1493
02:08:30,168 --> 02:08:33,335
Indeed. I have much to hear

1494
02:08:33,585 --> 02:08:36,710
How are you? Where were you?

1495
02:08:36,710 --> 02:08:41,210
Actually, I was in China, training

1496
02:08:41,960 --> 02:08:47,460
What training?
- Chinese torture training

1497
02:08:48,876 --> 02:08:52,335
In exchange for the diamond,
I'll teach you

1498
02:08:52,335 --> 02:08:55,751
How exciting!
- No need for that

1499
02:08:55,751 --> 02:09:01,293
There's need.
I know unique ways of torturing

1500
02:09:02,626 --> 02:09:06,751
I have changed, Tara
- You'll change again

1501
02:09:06,751 --> 02:09:09,793
No, I was born as Don,
got corrupted later

1502
02:09:10,085 --> 02:09:11,710
Let me start at the beginning

1503
02:09:14,876 --> 02:09:25,626
The masks you're wearing
are not yours

1504
02:09:26,710 --> 02:09:32,585
Step forward,
tell us what lies in your heart

1505
02:09:32,793 --> 02:09:38,710
Step forward,
tell us what lies in your heart

1506
02:09:39,001 --> 02:09:48,710
The path of your dreams...

1507
02:09:49,668 --> 02:09:59,168
...will lead you where you must go

1508
02:09:59,918 --> 02:10:04,793
Embrace those dreams

1509
02:10:05,710 --> 02:10:10,085
Tell us who you really are

1510
02:10:11,460 --> 02:10:19,876
Untie those shackles

1511
02:10:39,793 --> 02:10:46,543
You're someone else

1512
02:10:48,876 --> 02:10:53,376
You without boundary

1513
02:10:54,335 --> 02:11:00,335
Sky without limit

1514
02:11:01,710 --> 02:11:06,001
Be who you wish to be

1515
02:11:08,085 --> 02:11:11,251
You're the waves

1516
02:11:12,668 --> 02:11:15,710
You're the grandeur

1517
02:11:37,335 --> 02:11:38,835
Ladies and Gentlemen

1518
02:11:39,376 --> 02:11:40,543
Present...

1519
02:11:40,876 --> 02:11:42,376
The story teller...

1520
02:11:42,918 --> 02:11:44,876
Ved Vardhan Sahani.

1521
02:15:05,668 --> 02:15:07,376
I am convinced now

1522
02:15:09,168 --> 02:15:10,335
What?

1523
02:15:11,668 --> 02:15:13,793
You do have Teja's gold

1524
02:15:16,293 --> 02:15:17,543
For sure

1525
02:15:18,001 --> 02:15:18,876
So...

1526
02:16:16,210 --> 02:16:20,001
And then I thought,
dry up what's soaked

1527
02:16:20,876 --> 02:16:24,585
Be it female or male

1528
02:16:24,960 --> 02:16:25,835
Take the bait

1529
02:16:25,835 --> 02:16:27,960
She played a new ruse

1530
02:16:28,460 --> 02:16:30,626
And tricked me again

1531
02:16:30,626 --> 02:16:33,001
Trapped me for no reason

1532
02:16:33,293 --> 02:16:35,085
Curse you, O life

1533
02:17:08,960 --> 02:17:12,918
Listen, O beloved

1534
02:17:14,210 --> 02:17:17,918
My heart betrayed me

1535
02:17:17,918 --> 02:17:22,626
When I set eyes on you

1536
02:17:22,626 --> 02:17:27,543
I lost all senses

1537
02:17:27,835 --> 02:17:32,376
My weeping heart whispered

1538
02:17:32,376 --> 02:17:36,835
My eyes now speak for me

1539
02:17:37,168 --> 02:17:41,085
I see a new dream every day

1540
02:17:42,626 --> 02:17:47,293
My restless heart cries out

1541
02:17:47,293 --> 02:17:52,210
Don't hide behind that veil

1542
02:17:52,210 --> 02:17:56,126
A devoted lover...

1543
02:17:56,126 --> 02:18:00,835
...can only talk of love

1544
02:18:00,835 --> 02:18:03,585
The heart may lament

1545
02:18:03,585 --> 02:18:04,585
So...

1546
02:18:04,609 --> 02:18:34,609
