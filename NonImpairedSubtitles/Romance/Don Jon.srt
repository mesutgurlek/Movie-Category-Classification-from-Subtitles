00:10:55,756 --> 00:10:57,389
Since last Sunday,
I had sexual relations

151
00:10:57,391 --> 00:10:59,791
out of wedlock two times.
I also watched

152
00:10:59,793 --> 00:11:02,394
pornographic videos
and masturbated 17 times.

153

of my life, I am sorry.

00:44:23,861 --> 00:44:25,895
- You good?
- Yeah. You order anything yet?

736
00:44:25,897 --> 00:44:28,431
- No, I waited for you.
- Sweet.

737
00:44:30,401 --> 00:44:32,902
- Oh, fuck!
- Who's that?

738
00:44:32,904 --> 00:44:36,406
It's Linda. She's
been fighting with Chris.

739
00:44:36,408 --> 00:44:38,408
I don't think
they're gonna work out.

740
00:44:38,410 --> 00:44:41,778
- You remember Linda and Chris, yeah?
- Yeah, yeah.

741
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:45,381
- I thought they were cute together, no?
- Sure. They seemed pretty good.

742
00:44:45,383 --> 00:44:48,751
She's 28 years old. She put like four years
into the guy already. It's terrible.

743
00:44:48,753 --> 00:44:51,754
- (MOANING)
- How did you get off work tonight?

744
00:44:51,756 --> 00:44:53,723
I got Stevie to cover my shift.

745
00:44:53,725 --> 00:44:56,059
- Stevie?
- Yeah, he needed the hours.

746
00:44:56,061 --> 00:44:59,395
- I don't think I know Stevie, no?
- I don't think you met him.

747
00:44:59,397 --> 00:45:03,332
- Oh! I wish somebody would cover for me.
- See? What did I tell you?

748
00:45:03,334 --> 00:45:05,868
The service industry,
it's not a bad thing.

749
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:07,904
Come on, you're gonna
look so good in a suit.

750
00:45:07,906 --> 00:45:10,206
- I don't know.
- What? Please.

751
00:45:10,208 --> 00:45:12,108
If Armando can do it,
that man is such an asshole.

752
00:45:12,110 --> 00:45:15,378
- (MOANING)
- He treats women like they're trash, but...

753
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:18,881
...he makes six figures.

754
00:45:18,883 --> 00:45:22,318
Well, he's got a pretty good life, no?
If he could do it, you could do it.

755
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:25,354
- (MOANING)
- Hey, baby.

756
00:45:25,356 --> 00:45:29,358
You're a winner, right?
You respect people.

757
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:30,960
- You listen to people.
- (MOANING)

758
00:45:30,962 --> 00:45:34,163
- You think so?
- I know so, mister.

759
00:45:34,165 --> 00:45:36,733
(MOANING)

760
00:45:53,117 --> 00:45:54,217
(HORN HONKING)

761
00:45:54,219 --> 00:45:57,286
Fucking 'caused it! Fuck!

762
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:40,229
(PHONE VIBRATING)

763
00:46:45,402 --> 00:46:47,370
Hi, babe.

764
00:46:47,372 --> 00:46:50,339
I don't know which ones to get.
Baby, what do you think?

765
00:46:50,341 --> 00:46:53,509
That depends. You gonna
drill into your wall?

766
00:46:53,511 --> 00:46:55,278
I don't know.

767
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:58,080
- You don't have a drill, do you?
- No.

768
00:46:58,082 --> 00:47:01,317
Nah, I didn't think so. My dad
has got a pretty good one.

769
00:47:01,319 --> 00:47:03,519
If you want me, I can borrow
his, I'll do it for you.

770
00:47:03,521 --> 00:47:08,024
- You gonna drill into my wall for me?
- Whatever you want, babe.

771
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:13,396
You decide what color. I'm gonna
meet you at the registers.

772
00:47:13,398 --> 00:47:15,464
I wanna pick up a few things
in cleaning products.

773
00:47:15,466 --> 00:47:16,899
Where are you going?

774
00:47:16,901 --> 00:47:18,534
- What?
- Where are you going?

775
00:47:18,536 --> 00:47:20,436
I'm almost out of Swiffer pads.
I'm gonna pick a few up.

776
00:47:20,438 --> 00:47:22,338
- (LAUGHS) What pads?
- For the Swiffer.

777
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:25,074
- I don't know what that is.
- You don't know the Swiffer?

778
00:47:25,076 --> 00:47:27,210
- What is that? No.
- Seriously? It's the best.

779
00:47:27,212 --> 00:47:29,245
You gotta try it.
What do you do for your floors?

780
00:47:29,247 --> 00:47:31,480
You got those nice floors at
your place. What, do you mop?

781
00:47:31,482 --> 00:47:35,017
- No.
- What do you do?

782
00:47:35,019 --> 00:47:38,888
- I don't know. I sweep it up with a broom.
- No, I mean to really clean it.

783
00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:42,391
- I don't know. The housekeeper does it.
- Oh, right.

784
00:47:42,393 --> 00:47:45,094
- Listen, I'll just be a second, OK?
- No, no, no. Come here.

785
00:47:45,096 --> 00:47:48,097
- What?
- You're not gonna go buy a mop right now.

786
00:47:48,099 --> 00:47:50,566
- It's embarrassing.
- No, I told you, it's not a mop.

787
00:47:50,568 --> 00:47:52,401
- It's these pads.
- I don't care.

788
00:47:52,403 --> 00:47:54,270
You shouldn't be doing
your own housework.

789
00:47:54,272 --> 00:47:56,172
- Why not?
- 'Cause you're a grown man.

790
00:47:56,174 --> 00:47:58,407
You shouldn't be
cleaning your own floors.

791
00:47:58,409 --> 00:48:00,142
Why? I enjoy doing it.

792
00:48:00,144 --> 00:48:02,078
You know what? I'll call
Rosa. She'll do your place.

793
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:04,981
- Who?
- Rosa, my cleaning lady, she's great.

794
00:48:04,983 --> 00:48:07,483
Babe, no. Thanks, but
I like doing it myself.

795
00:48:07,485 --> 00:48:09,986
Are you kidding me?
You don't got to be doing that.

796
00:48:09,988 --> 00:48:12,588
She won't do it right anyway. You
gotta vacuum my carpet a certain way,

797
00:48:12,590 --> 00:48:15,258
- or else it looks...
- Don't talk about vacuuming in front of me.

798
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:18,261
- Why? What's wrong?
- Why? Because it's not sexy, that's why.

799
00:48:18,263 --> 00:48:20,429
You're not listening to me.
I like my place, OK?

800
00:48:20,431 --> 00:48:22,098
I'm proud of it,
I like to take care of it.

801
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:23,232
I don't care. We're not having

802
00:48:23,234 --> 00:48:24,667
this discussion right now.

803
00:48:24,669 --> 00:48:26,469
There's only a few things
I really care about...

804
00:48:26,471 --> 00:48:29,305
We're not talking
about this anymore.

805
00:48:34,611 --> 00:48:37,380
- Fine, let's drop it.
- Good.

806
00:48:40,017 --> 00:48:42,351
Those ones.

807
00:48:42,353 --> 00:48:44,687
- You want those?
- Yeah.

808
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:49,625
Come here. Listen to me.

809
00:48:49,627 --> 00:48:53,262
When we're living together,
you're not...

810
00:48:53,264 --> 00:48:56,532
...going to be doing...
any cleaning.

811
00:48:57,467 --> 00:48:59,368
Come on.

812
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:16,252
Jon? Excuse me. Look, I know
you don't wanna talk to me.

813
00:49:16,254 --> 00:49:18,120
I would leave you alone,
but I swear to God,

814
00:49:18,122 --> 00:49:20,456
I just fell asleep during
that entire class.

815
00:49:20,458 --> 00:49:23,526
The whole fucking thing.
Can I copy your notes?

816
00:49:23,528 --> 00:49:27,096
I'd ask somebody else, but everyone
in the class are like children.

817
00:49:27,098 --> 00:49:31,367
I'm not calling you old.
It'll take like five minutes...

818
00:49:31,369 --> 00:49:34,403
- Do you mind?
- Fine.

819
00:49:34,405 --> 00:49:37,440
Thank you so much. Do you wanna go somewhere?
There's a café...

820
00:49:37,442 --> 00:49:40,209
My girlfriend's
waiting at home, so...

821
00:49:40,211 --> 00:49:43,346
Oh. OK, well, then I'll...
OK, I'll do this.

822
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:55,658
I really shouldn't get so high after
lunch if I'm gonna be coming here later.

823
00:49:57,227 --> 00:49:59,562
You're probably right.

824
00:49:59,564 --> 00:50:04,200
- It is pretty boring, don't you think?
- What?

825
00:50:04,202 --> 00:50:08,537
- I said this class is pretty fucking boring.
- Oh. Yep.

826
00:50:08,539 --> 00:50:11,140
Like they're teaching
you to be a robot.

827
00:50:14,277 --> 00:50:17,513
- Why are you here?
- Hm?

828
00:50:17,515 --> 00:50:21,217
- Why did you pick this class?
- I didn't.

829
00:50:21,219 --> 00:50:23,352
What?

830
00:50:23,354 --> 00:50:26,756
No, it seemed like a good idea.
I'm in the service industry now.

831
00:50:26,758 --> 00:50:29,325
- You mean you're a waiter?
- No.

832
00:50:29,327 --> 00:50:31,694
- Bartender?
- Yeah, so, if you wanna move up,

833
00:50:31,696 --> 00:50:33,729
- you gotta go to school.
- Right.

834
00:50:33,731 --> 00:50:39,368
But what do you mean you
didn't pick this class?

835
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:42,271
- No, I did.
- Did somebody pick it for you?

836
00:50:42,273 --> 00:50:44,740
- No!
- Was it your parents or your girlfriend?

837
00:50:44,742 --> 00:50:46,709
- What is it with you? Huh?
- No, I just...

838
00:50:46,711 --> 00:50:49,211
- I was wondering...
- I'm doing something polite...

839
00:50:49,213 --> 00:50:51,580
That's mine.

840
00:50:51,582 --> 00:50:54,283
OK. Sorry.

841
00:50:57,687 --> 00:51:00,423
Jesus! (LAUGHS)

842
00:51:00,425 --> 00:51:05,161
- Oh, man! Oh, God!
- (ENGINE REVVING)

843
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:14,503
- Hey, baby.
- Hi, Jon.

844
00:51:14,505 --> 00:51:17,740
What's wrong?

845
00:51:17,742 --> 00:51:20,276
Remember when we
first started dating?

846
00:51:20,278 --> 00:51:24,246
What's the one thing I asked?
I said, "Don't lie to me."

847
00:51:24,248 --> 00:51:27,483
- All right, who's talking shit about me?
- Nobody said anything.

848
00:51:27,485 --> 00:51:32,188
- You gotta help me out...
- You looked at 46 porno sites today, Jon.

849
00:51:32,190 --> 00:51:34,623
- Just today.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

850
00:51:34,625 --> 00:51:37,493
- Don't fucking lie to me!
- I don't know who told you that!

851
00:51:37,495 --> 00:51:40,129
Nobody said anything. It's
right there in your history!

852
00:51:40,131 --> 00:51:43,566
All you do is look at porno.
That's all you fucking do!

853
00:51:43,568 --> 00:51:48,137
- Wait, wait. My what?
- It's in your history.

854
00:51:48,139 --> 00:51:50,406
In your browser?

855
00:51:50,408 --> 00:51:53,209
Come on, don't tell me you don't
know what your history is.

856
00:51:53,211 --> 00:51:56,245
No. Of course you don't, 'cause if
you did, you would have erased it,

857
00:51:56,247 --> 00:51:57,613
like a good little phony. Here.

858
00:51:57,615 --> 00:52:02,451
There. Go ahead,
look. Go ahead.

859
00:52:06,857 --> 00:52:09,725
- Baby, I...
- Please, no, don't call me that.

860
00:52:09,727 --> 00:52:12,795
- I love you.
- Don't ever say that to me, ever again.

861
00:52:12,797 --> 00:52:15,297
- What do you want me to say?
- What do I want you to say?

862
00:52:15,299 --> 00:52:18,834
How about, "I'm sorry I've been
lying to you since the first day"

863
00:52:18,836 --> 00:52:21,570
- that we started dating"? How about that?
- I'm sorry. I am.

864
00:52:21,572 --> 00:52:24,306
How about,
"I'm sorry I have more sex

865
00:52:24,308 --> 00:52:26,308
with that thing than
I do with my girlfriend"?

866
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:29,745
First of all, everybody
watches porn, OK? All guys.

867
00:52:29,747 --> 00:52:31,714
Any guy tells you he doesn't
is lying to you.

868
00:52:31,716 --> 00:52:33,716
- You are so full of shit!
- Second of all...

869
00:52:33,718 --> 00:52:37,453
- You are full of shit!
- Second of all, you know damn well

870
00:52:37,455 --> 00:52:39,421
- we do it all the fucking time!
- Yeah, I know we do.

871
00:52:39,423 --> 00:52:42,291
- Whenever you want!
- So what the fuck is wrong with you?

872
00:52:42,293 --> 00:52:44,793
What the fuck are you doing?
How do you watch that shit?

873
00:52:44,795 --> 00:52:47,196
I don't know! OK? I don't know!

874
00:52:47,198 --> 00:52:49,899
How do you watch all the stupid
fucking movies you watch?

875
00:52:49,901 --> 00:52:51,867
How do I watch movies?
What are you talking about?

876
00:52:51,869 --> 00:52:54,537
I'm saying, you probably watch
that shit as much as I watch porn.

877
00:52:54,539 --> 00:52:56,705
What are you saying? That has
nothing to do with anything!

878
00:52:56,707 --> 00:53:00,376
- I'm just saying...
- Jon, movies and porno are different!

879
00:53:00,378 --> 00:53:03,212
- They give awards for movies!

I always have.

but, no offense...

No, no, no offense taken. So
you like porn better than sex?

Well, what is it?

1038
01:04:04,408 --> 01:04:07,442
that you don't get from sex
with an actual person?

1039

- You lose yourself.

Yeah, just... goodbye.

1041

- I wish it did.

- Did you ever watch it?
- No.

- ANGIE: What?

1166
01:16:50,873 --> 01:16:56,277
- Barbara and I split up.
- I can't believe it, this is horrible!

1167
01:16:56,279 --> 01:16:58,613

- I don't think so.

- Sorry. What do you want me to do?

1170
01:17:03,186 --> 01:17:06,921
I just want you to be happy, that's all!
Is that too much to ask?

1171
01:17:06,923 --> 01:17:11,158
- I wasn't happy.
- A nice wife and some nice kids?

1172
01:17:11,160 --> 01:17:13,928

I look like a grandmother,

1173

any grandchildren? No!

is that what I'm hearing?

- JON SR.: All right!

Stop upsetting your mother! What
the fuck is the matter with you?

1180
01:17:30,780 --> 01:17:33,180
- I don't know.
- Having a family is the greatest joy

1181
01:17:33,182 --> 01:17:36,117
- in a man's life, everybody knows that!
- Then maybe I'm not a man.

Maybe one day, but not right now!

She doesn't care about Jonny,

1187
01:17:56,372 --> 01:17:58,439
she doesn't know
the first thing about him.

1188
01:17:58,441 --> 01:18:01,375

- Really?

1221

You asked for a lot,

and then...

Yeah! Well, I thought it was on
with old crop top.

- She was tight though.

01:21:55,678 --> 01:21:57,611
- Eight.
- Solid eight.

1242
01:21:57,613 --> 01:21:59,947
Her body was at least an eight,
but you didn't talk to her.

1243
01:21:59,949 --> 01:22:02,449
- Who cares how she talks?
- You asked why I didn't smash,

1244
01:22:02,451 --> 01:22:06,453
that's why I didn't smash. What about you?
You were kicking it to pony-tail, right?

1245
01:22:06,455 --> 01:22:09,423
- How did it go?
- You get her name?
