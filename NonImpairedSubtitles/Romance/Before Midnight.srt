00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Before.Midnight.2013.720p.BluRay.x264.YIFY

2
00:00:33,745 --> 00:00:35,576
So you got everything?
Mm-hm.

3
00:00:35,745 --> 00:00:37,383
You gonna play video
games the whole flight

4
00:00:37,585 --> 00:00:40,258
or do you think you might
actually crack a book?

5
00:00:40,425 --> 00:00:41,824
Probably read some.

6
00:00:41,985 --> 00:00:45,455
Well, if I write you an e-mail,
don't be scared to write back.

7
00:00:45,625 --> 00:00:49,459
Let your old man know what you're
thinking about, what's going on.

8
00:00:49,665 --> 00:00:51,974
Yeah.
If you want, we could try Skyping

9
00:00:52,145 --> 00:00:54,261
once a week or something.
All right.

10
00:00:54,425 --> 00:00:55,858
Yeah. Okay.

11
00:00:56,025 --> 00:00:58,220
You got the drawings
for your science deal?

12
00:00:58,425 --> 00:00:59,460
Yeah, think so.

13
00:00:59,625 --> 00:01:02,458
Well, they turned out great,
by the way. Really great.

14
00:01:02,625 --> 00:01:03,944
Thanks.

15
00:01:04,145 --> 00:01:06,579
What...? Is your computer charged?
Yeah.

16
00:01:11,065 --> 00:01:14,774
What do you think is the first thing
you're gonna do when you get home?

17
00:01:14,945 --> 00:01:17,176
I don't know.
Hm? Oh.

18
00:01:17,466 --> 00:01:20,936
I really cherish this communication we have.
You know, it's just...

19
00:01:21,106 --> 00:01:23,176
Your answers are so...
What?

20
00:01:23,946 --> 00:01:26,585
Just keep practicing the piano.
You're really good.

21
00:01:26,826 --> 00:01:29,340
They spend so much time
at that school of yours...

22
00:01:29,546 --> 00:01:31,662
Music is something you'll use in life.

23
00:01:31,866 --> 00:01:34,585
And don't forget to...
You want those sesame things.

24
00:01:34,786 --> 00:01:36,185
Yeah.
All right.

25
00:01:38,266 --> 00:01:39,938
There you go.
Thank you.

26
00:01:40,146 --> 00:01:41,738
Okay.

27
00:01:41,946 --> 00:01:46,622
I'll probably make it over there in October.
I'll try to see you in that first recital.

28
00:01:46,826 --> 00:01:49,420
And hopefully catch
a soccer game while I'm there.

29
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:55,779
I might not even play soccer
this year.

30
00:01:56,146 --> 00:01:58,376
Oh, that'd be a big mistake.
Trust me.

31
00:01:58,586 --> 00:02:01,305
I'm not that good.
Oh, no, you're pretty good.

32
00:02:01,506 --> 00:02:03,701
You are. Huh?

33
00:02:03,906 --> 00:02:07,694
I missed summer training camp.
The chances of me starting are miniscule.

34
00:02:07,946 --> 00:02:10,062
Well, just tell the coach
the situation.

35
00:02:10,266 --> 00:02:13,178
Your dad lives in Europe.
You really wanted to be there.

36
00:02:13,386 --> 00:02:16,696
You know, blah, blah, blah. Blame me.
"My parents stink, but I'm really serious."

37
00:02:16,906 --> 00:02:18,942
But I'm not serious, Dad.

38
00:02:19,146 --> 00:02:21,341
I don't care that much.

39
00:02:22,186 --> 00:02:25,940
Well, you don't have to decide right now.
You know, just think about it.

40
00:02:26,106 --> 00:02:30,145
All I'm saying is that team sports
are important, you know?

41
00:02:32,386 --> 00:02:34,024
Here we are.

42
00:02:35,426 --> 00:02:37,701
I love this airport.
It's awesome.

43
00:02:37,906 --> 00:02:40,626
Heh. It's cool, right?
You excited about seeing your mom?

44
00:02:40,787 --> 00:02:42,140
Yeah, and all my friends.

45
00:02:42,307 --> 00:02:44,741
Yeah. What about your
boarding pass, passport?

46
00:02:44,987 --> 00:02:47,421
You feel confident
about making the connection?

47
00:02:47,627 --> 00:02:51,142
I did this before.
But not with a tricky connection like this.

48
00:02:51,347 --> 00:02:53,941
Remember, when you land,
you stay in your seat,

49
00:02:54,147 --> 00:02:57,822
somebody from the airline is gonna
take you to the gate, all right?

50
00:02:58,027 --> 00:03:01,781
It's not a problem.
Okay. All right. Heh-heh-heh.

51
00:03:02,387 --> 00:03:04,184
Oh, boy.

52
00:03:05,067 --> 00:03:10,016
Well, looks like maybe we should
just do this thing, huh? Hm?

53
00:03:10,267 --> 00:03:11,939
Okay, come here. Oh, God.

54
00:03:12,147 --> 00:03:14,661
I'm gonna do my best
to make that recital, okay?

55
00:03:15,827 --> 00:03:18,785
You know, I wouldn't bother.

56
00:03:19,387 --> 00:03:23,221
Heh. What makes you say that?
I'm not being mean, but it'd be easier

57
00:03:23,427 --> 00:03:26,339
if you didn't come to the recital.
How come?

58
00:03:26,547 --> 00:03:29,107
Be better if you visited
on a "nothing" weekend.

59
00:03:29,307 --> 00:03:33,619
But I wanna see you play.
It's because Mom hates you so much.

60
00:03:33,827 --> 00:03:37,945
She'd be really stressed if you were
there and then it'd be tense for me.

61
00:03:39,147 --> 00:03:41,741
You know, go on.
Thank you.

62
00:03:42,507 --> 00:03:46,944
We wouldn't have any time to hang out.
Don't worry. We'll figure that out.

63
00:03:47,147 --> 00:03:49,980
I just don't want you to worry
about it, you know?

64
00:03:50,187 --> 00:03:52,621
I mean, you know
how much I miss you, right?

65
00:03:56,947 --> 00:03:59,336
Why do you think
she still hates me so much?

66
00:03:59,507 --> 00:04:03,217
I don't know. I think she hates Daniel
more than she hates you.

67
00:04:03,628 --> 00:04:07,064
Right.
Hey, don't worry. I'll figure something out.

68
00:04:07,228 --> 00:04:09,503
We should just do this thing.
Yeah.

69
00:04:09,668 --> 00:04:11,499
Is there anything
I can do to help?

70
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:14,176
I don't know.
But you know I love you, right?

71
00:04:14,388 --> 00:04:15,980
Yeah, I know.
All right.

72
00:04:16,188 --> 00:04:18,304
This has been the best summer
of my life.

73
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:20,385
Really?
Yeah.

74
00:04:20,788 --> 00:04:21,823
Well, me too.

75
00:04:22,028 --> 00:04:24,622
I told you this Greece thing
was gonna be great.

76
00:04:24,828 --> 00:04:26,898
And it was.
Okay. All right.

77
00:04:27,068 --> 00:04:28,421
I love you, pal.

78
00:04:28,628 --> 00:04:30,107
Love you too, Dad.
Okay.

79
00:04:30,348 --> 00:04:32,657
Okay, shake my hand.
All right.

80
00:04:32,868 --> 00:04:34,824
Bye.
All right. See you.

81
00:05:45,229 --> 00:05:46,662
Okay.

82
00:06:21,269 --> 00:06:22,463
Okay.

83
00:06:27,389 --> 00:06:28,538
So, what's going on?

84
00:06:28,749 --> 00:06:31,468
They voted against it.
What? The wind turbines?

85
00:06:31,669 --> 00:06:35,457
Six months dealing with those people,
everyone agreed it was great.

86
00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:36,664
So, what happened?

87
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:39,263
They don't like the way
it looks on that hill.

88
00:06:39,469 --> 00:06:41,778
No. I thought it was a done deal.
It was.

89
00:06:41,989 --> 00:06:44,549
That's what's so infuriating.
Can they do that?

90
00:06:44,749 --> 00:06:47,947
Of course, they've done it.
That's it. It's over, finis.

91
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:51,179
I'm sorry.
No, no. It's just so frustrating.

92
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:53,261
I can't take it anymore.

93
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:57,825
I'm gonna take that job
with Remy.

94
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:00,180
No, no. No, you don't
wanna work for him.

95
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:02,261
Why not?
For the government?

96
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:06,742
This is different. We need laws. That's
the only way anything is gonna happen.

97
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:09,743
Not the only way.
You have been getting good work done.

98
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:12,060
I've been thinking.
This is the way to go.

99
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:14,460
Let me remind you
you do not like that guy.

100
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:17,383
You worked for him before.
You complained about him.

101
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:19,859
He gets things done.
That's how I'm gonna be.

102
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:21,429
Okay.
A real bitch, okay?

103
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:26,425
Well, every time I look at that guy, all I
see is ambition. Sorry, I don't trust him.

104
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:30,185
He's going from nonprofit to government
to have people kiss his ass.

105
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:31,743
I don't care about him.

106
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:34,185
And I think
you're gonna be miserable.

107
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:36,858
Just with all the politicking
and compromise.

108
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:40,062
I've made my decision.
I'm tired of being the do-gooder

109
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:42,949
that rolls a boulder up
and watches it roll down.

110
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:46,386
Isn't Remy the guy who used to throw
his pens at his assistant?

111
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:48,700
I should have taken
this job a year ago.

112
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:53,068
I was scared of the amount of work,
but I think it's the best opportunity.

113
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:55,539
And it's more money,
and I'm doing it.

114
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:58,469
Okay. Are you sure?

115
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:01,901
No, I'm not sure of anything, okay?
All right. Heh.

116
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:04,340
What's gonna happen
to everyone if I leave?

117
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:07,064
Like François and...
I mean, they count on me.

118
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:08,663
What do you think?

119
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:11,544
Should I take it or not?
I don't have an opinion.

120
00:08:11,751 --> 00:08:15,744
I don't wanna see you rush into
a decision because of this wind turbine.

121
00:08:15,991 --> 00:08:18,630
Not just that. It's been
stirring in me all summer.

122
00:08:18,871 --> 00:08:20,190
I know.
I should do it.

123
00:08:20,391 --> 00:08:22,541
All right... Then do it.
I'm doing it.

124
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:25,225
I'm doing it. All right?

125
00:08:26,551 --> 00:08:28,507
Oh, God.
I wish things were simpler.

126
00:08:28,751 --> 00:08:31,345
If I leave, I get fucked,
if I stay, I get fucked.

127
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:32,739
Heh, heh.
There's always a catch.

128
00:08:32,951 --> 00:08:35,385
The world is fucked.
Yeah, maybe.

129
00:08:35,631 --> 00:08:39,863
Oh, God. We finally have a vacation
and the girls are sick for two weeks.

130
00:08:40,071 --> 00:08:43,780
I know. I have the perfect son.
He lives a million miles away.

131
00:08:44,311 --> 00:08:49,465
Or the love of your life can't clean up
after himself or learn how to shave.

132
00:08:49,711 --> 00:08:52,942
Who's that? I mean, you're not talking
about Captain Cleanup.

133
00:08:53,151 --> 00:08:57,064
Captain Cleanup. The one that's
been missing in action all these years.

134
00:08:57,231 --> 00:08:58,789
What'd you expect
at this point

135
00:08:58,991 --> 00:09:02,586
in your life, missy?
Ay, ay, ay! God.

136
00:09:03,711 --> 00:09:05,747
Oh, look at them.
They're so cute.

137
00:09:05,951 --> 00:09:08,340
They look like conjoined twins.
Heh.

138
00:09:08,551 --> 00:09:10,746
Oh, my God,
I'm gonna take a picture.

139
00:09:10,951 --> 00:09:14,546
Hey, did Ella finish that apple?

140
00:09:15,191 --> 00:09:17,500
The... Take food out of
your child's mouth?

141
00:09:17,671 --> 00:09:19,104
Yeah.
Okay.

142
00:09:19,271 --> 00:09:21,660
Well, it's all brown.

143
00:09:21,831 --> 00:09:24,345
No, no, no,
there's a spot here.

144
00:09:26,511 --> 00:09:27,785
Mm.

145
00:09:27,951 --> 00:09:33,231
Ella, this is evidence of your
father stealing food from you.

146
00:09:33,392 --> 00:09:35,303
If you become bulimic
or anorexic,

147
00:09:35,472 --> 00:09:36,985
Heh. Jesus.
it's not my fault.

148
00:09:37,152 --> 00:09:40,588
Don't blame it all on your mother.
Ella, this is a family apple.

149
00:09:40,752 --> 00:09:43,346
I'm teaching you the value of sharing.
I love you, honey.

150
00:09:43,512 --> 00:09:45,548
Aw. So sweet.

151
00:09:45,792 --> 00:09:48,590
You will remember this vacation
different than we will.

152
00:09:48,832 --> 00:09:50,868
That's for sure.
I see that with my mom.

153
00:09:51,032 --> 00:09:53,466
She remembers my childhood
different than I do.

154
00:09:53,672 --> 00:09:56,140
Please, stop filming me.
Okay.

155
00:09:56,752 --> 00:10:00,222
God. I love your mom.
You're always so hard on her.

156
00:10:00,472 --> 00:10:03,828
You missed the fucked-up years.
You're just getting the good era.

157
00:10:03,992 --> 00:10:07,348
The fucked-up years. Heh, heh.
That reminds me, talking about fucked up,

158
00:10:07,512 --> 00:10:11,471
did I ever tell you the story
of my little Cleopatra kitty?

159
00:10:12,032 --> 00:10:15,581
No.
No? I think you would remember if I did.

160
00:10:15,792 --> 00:10:20,149
It's the story... You know, when I was a
little girl, I had this cat named Cleopatra.

161
00:10:20,312 --> 00:10:23,031
Every spring, she'd jump the fence,
get pregnant

162
00:10:23,192 --> 00:10:27,310
and always end up
with a litter of exactly two kittens.

163
00:10:27,512 --> 00:10:29,070
Two kitties, huh?
Two kitties.

164
00:10:29,272 --> 00:10:31,228
Every time, every year,
two cats.

165
00:10:31,432 --> 00:10:33,024
I mean, it's just amazing.

166
00:10:33,232 --> 00:10:37,066
Then one day, I was, like, around 30,
and was having lunch with my dad

167
00:10:37,232 --> 00:10:40,269
and I was remembering...
Mentioning little Cleopatra,

168
00:10:40,512 --> 00:10:41,581
and he was like:

169
00:10:41,792 --> 00:10:46,502
"The hardest thing I ever had to do
was to kill those cute little kittens."

170
00:10:46,712 --> 00:10:47,906
And I was like, "What?"

171
00:10:48,112 --> 00:10:50,831
It turns out...
Listen to this.

172
00:10:51,032 --> 00:10:53,944
There were sometimes
up to seven kittens in that litter.

173
00:10:54,152 --> 00:10:55,188
Oh, no.

174
00:10:55,353 --> 00:10:57,344
He would take five of them,
Oh, no.

175
00:10:57,513 --> 00:10:59,708
put them into a bag
with a bunch of ether.

176
00:10:59,873 --> 00:11:01,989
That's terrible.

177
00:11:02,393 --> 00:11:03,428
That was like...

178
00:11:03,633 --> 00:11:06,750
He had forgotten the lie he
and my mom had told me as a kid.

179
00:11:06,993 --> 00:11:10,030
How did he decide which ones to kill?
I asked him that.

180
00:11:10,233 --> 00:11:13,748
"Did you take the fluffiest? Cutest?"
Right.

181
00:11:13,913 --> 00:11:16,427
You know?
He just started to cry.

182
00:11:16,633 --> 00:11:18,749
Aw.
Poor Daddy.

183
00:11:18,993 --> 00:11:21,985
Oh. We said we were gonna stop.
They wanted to see the ruins.

184
00:11:22,193 --> 00:11:23,228
Should we?

185
00:11:23,473 --> 00:11:24,952
Well, Ella really wanted to.

186
00:11:25,153 --> 00:11:28,429
- But should we wake them up?
- I don't know.

187
00:11:28,633 --> 00:11:31,591
On our way back to the airport,
we can catch them. Hm?

188
00:11:31,793 --> 00:11:33,545
You know we won't.
Probably not.

189
00:11:33,713 --> 00:11:34,862
Oh, God.

190
00:11:35,033 --> 00:11:37,024
So long, ancient ruins.
Shh.

191
00:11:37,233 --> 00:11:39,872
What's so great about you anyway?
Seen one, seen them all.

192
00:11:41,433 --> 00:11:44,709
Oh, my God. We are shitty parents.
We should have stopped.

193
00:11:44,873 --> 00:11:46,670
Ah, it's okay.
It's culture. Go back.

194
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:49,745
You gotta put character into these kids.
Yeah, yeah.

195
00:11:49,953 --> 00:11:54,026
We're teaching them a valuable lesson.
If you snooze, you lose in this world.

196
00:11:54,233 --> 00:11:56,667
And when the girls are in rehab
Ha-ha-ha.

197
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:59,586
recovering from 10 years
of addiction to coke and speed,

198
00:11:59,793 --> 00:12:02,785
they'll say, "We never felt
comfortable falling asleep.

199
00:12:02,993 --> 00:12:07,145
Daddy used to tell us, "You snooze,
you lose." And that'll be your fault again.

200
00:12:07,313 --> 00:12:10,032
Yeah, well, we are shitty parents.
I know.

201
00:12:10,193 --> 00:12:13,390
Oh... Saying goodbye
to Hank sucked.

202
00:12:14,113 --> 00:12:15,262
Why, was he upset?

203
00:12:15,473 --> 00:12:18,705
No, no. He said it was
the best summer of his life.

204
00:12:18,914 --> 00:12:20,233
Well, that's great.

205
00:12:20,434 --> 00:12:23,983
I mean, I wouldn't worry too much
about him. We spoke a bunch.

206
00:12:24,194 --> 00:12:27,391
You know what his main concerns are?
What?

207
00:12:27,594 --> 00:12:31,587
Pimples and how girls perceive him.
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

208
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:34,302
What do you mean? I'm not like that.
Oh, please.

209
00:12:34,474 --> 00:12:36,066
What?
That's all you think about.

210
00:12:36,234 --> 00:12:38,429
What?
Women. I mean...

211
00:12:38,594 --> 00:12:42,587
Heh. I'm not complaining,
I'm getting a lot of attention.

212
00:12:42,794 --> 00:12:47,310
But you never stop ogling girls, like:
I don't ogle girls. I don't ogle girls.

213
00:12:47,554 --> 00:12:51,706
I make love to them with my eyes.

214
00:12:51,874 --> 00:12:54,183
I like the Spanish guy.
Or is it Greek?

215
00:12:54,434 --> 00:12:58,109
I don't know where I'm from,
but I'm very hairy.

216
00:13:02,434 --> 00:13:06,268
Well, I think... You know,
Henry might have, you know...

217
00:13:06,474 --> 00:13:07,509
What?

218
00:13:07,714 --> 00:13:10,387
With that little Melina girl.

219
00:13:10,594 --> 00:13:13,586
I don't know.
He had a crush, but...

220
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:15,028
Oh, are you kidding?
What?

221
00:13:15,234 --> 00:13:18,351
Why do you think he said
it was the best summer of his life?

222
00:13:18,554 --> 00:13:21,022
Because he and I
had a good time together?

223
00:13:22,714 --> 00:13:24,193
Jesse.
No, huh?

224
00:13:24,394 --> 00:13:26,783
So, what, you think they...?
Of course.

225
00:13:26,994 --> 00:13:29,303
They kissed?
Yeah, they kissed. Yeah, yeah.

226
00:13:29,554 --> 00:13:32,626
I was sworn to secrecy, but he told me.
What did he say?

227
00:13:32,834 --> 00:13:35,394
I'm not supposed to tell you.
I'm not gonna talk.

228
00:13:35,594 --> 00:13:37,312
Hey, hey. Come on.
Okay.

229
00:13:37,514 --> 00:13:41,952
He told me he was worried...
You know, concerned about the kissing.

230
00:13:42,195 --> 00:13:43,674
You know, tongue. Her tongue.

231
00:13:43,835 --> 00:13:45,746
What, he kissed her?
Yeah.

232
00:13:45,955 --> 00:13:50,392
But he was so cute, all nervous,
all red, biting his cheek.

233
00:13:50,595 --> 00:13:51,948
Like when he was little.

234
00:13:52,155 --> 00:13:54,623
So he and Melina were a real thing?
Yeah.

235
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:56,786
What's gonna happen now?

236
00:13:56,995 --> 00:13:59,429
I don't know. They must be
friends on Facebook.

237
00:13:59,635 --> 00:14:02,308
Keep in touch for a while.
Hey, hey. What if they end up

238
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:05,751
spending their life together, you know?
You're so corny.

239
00:14:05,955 --> 00:14:07,673
Ha-ha-ha. No.
Sometimes, I'm just like...

240
00:14:07,835 --> 00:14:10,190
What are you, a 12-year-old girl?
I'm just...

241
00:14:10,395 --> 00:14:12,989
First love, do you even
remember who it was?

242
00:14:13,195 --> 00:14:17,108
Yeah, I do. It was you.
Oh, please, like you were a virgin at 23.

243
00:14:17,355 --> 00:14:20,108
You said first love,
not first sexual experience.

244
00:14:20,355 --> 00:14:23,267
Fine. I'm the first woman
you ever fell in love with?

245
00:14:23,475 --> 00:14:24,749
Yeah.
I don't think so.

246
00:14:24,955 --> 00:14:28,914
First one I felt truly connected to, sure.
What, I wasn't your first love?

247
00:14:30,075 --> 00:14:32,908
No, of course not.
Oh.

248
00:14:34,755 --> 00:14:37,872
No, I just... I thought I was.
Oh... Ha-ha-ha.

249
00:14:38,035 --> 00:14:40,629
Jesse, stop this. It's dumb.
It's okay. Not a big deal.

250
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:43,264
No. Okay, how old are you?
Come on.

251
00:14:43,475 --> 00:14:46,512
I'm 41 and I've loved only you.

252
00:14:52,315 --> 00:14:55,785
You are so, so working
on our little night already.

253
00:14:55,995 --> 00:15:01,945
Hell, yeah. I got a Trojan in my billfold,
and a rocket in my pocket.

254
00:15:02,115 --> 00:15:05,347
I'm stuck with
an American teenager.

255
00:15:05,636 --> 00:15:07,388
I can't believe it.

256
00:15:07,596 --> 00:15:10,064
Do we have to do
all that stuff later?

257
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:12,392
What? Oh, yeah, come on.

258
00:15:12,596 --> 00:15:16,555
It means a lot to Patrick. Ariadni and
Stefanos are already there prepping.

259
00:15:16,756 --> 00:15:18,986
The kids wanted one more big time.
No, no.

260
00:15:19,156 --> 00:15:20,874
No, no,
but I meant the hotel later.

261
00:15:22,236 --> 00:15:24,875
I'm not sure I want to go...
Hi, sweetie.

262
00:15:25,076 --> 00:15:26,395
Yeah.

263
00:15:26,636 --> 00:15:29,833
Oh, okay, okay, okay.
Well, it's fine. It's fine.

264
00:15:30,036 --> 00:15:32,789
Call me from London.
Have a good flight. Bye.

265
00:15:32,956 --> 00:15:35,675
They were telling them
to turn everything off.

266
00:15:35,836 --> 00:15:40,193
And I asked him to call me from
the plane. I don't like when he flies.

267
00:15:46,716 --> 00:15:48,229
What?

268
00:15:49,996 --> 00:15:52,305
What is it?
It's just...

269
00:15:52,516 --> 00:15:55,110
I don't know.
I don't know. I don't...

270
00:15:55,836 --> 00:15:58,191
I just don't think I can keep
doing this.

271
00:15:58,396 --> 00:15:59,829
What?

272
00:16:00,076 --> 00:16:03,955
It's just every summer, every Christmas.
You know, it's like...

273
00:16:04,596 --> 00:16:08,145
I mean... It wouldn't be so bad,
It makes me ill every time.

274
00:16:08,356 --> 00:16:12,793
you know, like if we were sending him
to boarding school or just...

275
00:16:12,996 --> 00:16:16,147
I don't know, if his mom and I
got along a little bit better.

276
00:16:16,356 --> 00:16:19,075
It's like we're sending him back
across enemy lines.

277
00:16:19,276 --> 00:16:20,709
It really hit me this time.

278
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:24,113
It's, like, he's gonna be
a freshman in high school.

279
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:26,911
Four more years
and he's gonna be on his own.

280
00:16:27,117 --> 00:16:30,473
Maybe that's good. Only four years.
This is the crucial time.

281
00:16:30,677 --> 00:16:35,148
I just feel like I should be there for him.
Like it's now or never, you know?

282
00:16:35,797 --> 00:16:37,708
No. What do you mean?

283
00:16:38,837 --> 00:16:42,796
I just thought somehow he'd end up
living with us somewhere along the way.

284
00:16:42,997 --> 00:16:44,794
You know,
time's going by so fast.

285
00:16:44,997 --> 00:16:46,794
And here we are, it's high school.

286
00:16:46,997 --> 00:16:50,831
There's girls. Next thing you know,
it's college applications.

287
00:16:51,037 --> 00:16:52,789
You're right, maybe it's time.

288
00:16:52,997 --> 00:16:57,354
I mean, it's time to tell his mom all this
and ask if he can come and live with us.

289
00:16:57,557 --> 00:16:59,832
He'd love it.
We can put him in that bilin...

290
00:16:59,997 --> 00:17:02,272
That's never gonna happen,
all right?

291
00:17:02,477 --> 00:17:06,072
She's never gonna give me one thing
she's not legally obligated to.

292
00:17:06,317 --> 00:17:09,753
You wanna call that lawyer again?
No. He's terrible.

293
00:17:09,957 --> 00:17:11,390
Should I call his mother?

294
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:13,792
Uh, no. Please. Never again.

295
00:17:14,037 --> 00:17:16,756
Look, he doesn't even know
how to throw a baseball.

296
00:17:16,997 --> 00:17:18,430
Who cares?

297
00:17:18,637 --> 00:17:22,550
It's just... He leads with his elbow.
He throws like a girl.

298
00:17:22,757 --> 00:17:25,396
It's not your fault.
No, it is my fault.

299
00:17:25,597 --> 00:17:29,351
A father is supposed to teach you that.
He just doesn't like baseball.

300
00:17:29,557 --> 00:17:32,276
It's an example.
It's a metaphor for everything.

301
00:17:32,477 --> 00:17:36,356
He's turning 14,
and he needs his father.

302
00:17:39,677 --> 00:17:41,827
Jesse, I'm not moving to Chicago.

303
00:17:42,037 --> 00:17:45,666
Did I ask you to? Where did that
come from? I'm thinking out loud.

304
00:17:45,877 --> 00:17:48,756
This is the one thing I promised
myself I'd never do

305
00:17:48,958 --> 00:17:50,755
and I look up and I'm doing it.

306
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:54,951
Well, listen, you're a wonderful father.
He loves the relationship you have.

307
00:17:55,158 --> 00:17:57,911
He loves the letters.
He doesn't read the letters.

308
00:17:58,118 --> 00:18:01,793
He reads them. He doesn't compliment.
I know if I miss these years,

309
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:04,068
they are never coming back.

310
00:18:05,998 --> 00:18:09,070
Oh, my God.
What?

311
00:18:09,238 --> 00:18:11,593
This is where it ends.

312
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:13,991
What are you talking about?

313
00:18:14,198 --> 00:18:16,666
This is how people start breaking up.
Oh, my God.

314
00:18:16,878 --> 00:18:19,597
You just jumped off a cliff.
No, I'm marking this.

315
00:18:19,758 --> 00:18:24,115
This is the day you light the ticking
bomb that will destroy our lives.

316
00:18:25,798 --> 00:18:26,833
Yeah.
Okay.

317
00:18:27,038 --> 00:18:29,632
First, you don't light
a ticking bomb. You set it.

318
00:18:29,838 --> 00:18:34,389
It has a timer. That's why it ticks.
Whatever. Well, it's ticking right now.

319
00:18:34,598 --> 00:18:38,432
This is how it happens. You're unhappy,
you blame it on the other person.

320
00:18:38,598 --> 00:18:42,307
Resentment grows, you break up.
You're just doing this to shut me up.

321
00:18:42,478 --> 00:18:44,708
Not at all. No.
That's what you're doing.

322
00:18:44,918 --> 00:18:47,716
I'm surprised we lasted this long.
The hyperbole.

323
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:50,950
We're on parallel tracks,
but now the tracks have crossed.

324
00:18:51,118 --> 00:18:52,915
I'm going west. You're going east.

325
00:18:53,118 --> 00:18:56,394
This is how it happens. I've seen it.
Katherine and Alexander...

326
00:18:56,638 --> 00:18:59,232
You're kidding, right? You're kidding?
Well, no.

327
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:00,712
I'm kidding.

328
00:19:00,918 --> 00:19:02,476
And I'm not.

329
00:19:02,838 --> 00:19:03,873
All right?

330
00:19:04,078 --> 00:19:05,636
I'm just...

331
00:19:05,838 --> 00:19:08,671
This is it.
How much longer to the ruins?

332
00:19:08,878 --> 00:19:11,073
Oh, they were closed.

333
00:19:11,318 --> 00:19:12,434
Yeah.
We... Yeah.

334
00:19:12,639 --> 00:19:16,348
We're gonna catch them on the way
back when we're going to the airport.

335
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:17,594
Okay?
Exactly.

336
00:19:17,799 --> 00:19:20,393
We'll leave early, right? Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah.

337
00:19:20,599 --> 00:19:22,829
What happened to my apple?

338
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:25,274
Your apple.

339
00:19:30,239 --> 00:19:31,957
Right?

340
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,475
Give me the list.
I don't have it.

341
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:51,271
It's in your wallet.

342
00:19:51,479 --> 00:19:52,832
In your wallet.

343
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:54,836
Okay.
Yeah.

344
00:19:56,359 --> 00:19:58,509
Okay, I'm the general.

345
00:20:02,519 --> 00:20:05,397
Who made you general?
The general, okay?

346
00:20:10,359 --> 00:20:12,748
Private Cleanup.
You don't touch anything.

347
00:20:14,439 --> 00:20:16,270
Ugh.

348
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,558
Nina!

349
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,632
Ariadni. Ah!

350
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,548
You gotta do better than that.
No, no, no.

351
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:56,278
I got you. Oh. Oh! Oh!

352
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,954
Oh, where's my team?
Where's my team?

353
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,032
The red ones.

354
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,719
Okay. Pepper.

355
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:47,911
Uh, I read both. The first one is
That Time, second is This Time.

356
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,156
First is This Time,
second is That Time.

357
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:53,909
We've got a joke in our family
that This brought us back together

358
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,310
and That paid for our apartment.
Okay.

359
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,520
It must be a little weird for Celine,
the way she's in the book like that.

360
00:22:00,721 --> 00:22:02,359
Why? She's gotten used to it.

361
00:22:02,561 --> 00:22:06,474
Second one is sexy. He misses
the plane, they black out the windows

362
00:22:06,641 --> 00:22:11,192
and they have sex for days and days
and days like there's no tomorrow, whoa.

363
00:22:11,401 --> 00:22:13,756
Did you guys actually do that?

364
00:22:14,481 --> 00:22:16,949
You did that, huh?
You read Jesse's third book?

365
00:22:17,121 --> 00:22:19,032
It's better than the first two.

366
00:22:19,241 --> 00:22:21,994
Took longer to write
than the first two put together.

367
00:22:22,201 --> 00:22:26,035
Third one I didn't read. My wife
gave it to me, but it's too long for me.

368
00:22:26,241 --> 00:22:28,152
The title is long. What's the title?

369
00:22:28,321 --> 00:22:31,996
Temporary Cast Members of a Long
Running But Little Seen Production

370
00:22:32,161 --> 00:22:35,870
of a Play Called Fleeting.
Well, exactly, my point.

371
00:22:36,081 --> 00:22:38,072
Everybody else thought
it was too long.

372
00:22:38,281 --> 00:22:41,193
Well, it's a better book.
It's so much more ambitious.

373
00:22:45,041 --> 00:22:46,440
What's that?

374
00:22:46,641 --> 00:22:50,316
No, he says he likes all the books.

375
00:22:50,521 --> 00:22:52,432
He does. Huh?

376
00:22:52,601 --> 00:22:54,319
Well...
Ha, ha.

377
00:22:54,521 --> 00:22:56,671
I love it here.
This place is amazing.

378
00:22:56,921 --> 00:22:59,196
Those tomatoes are so amazing.
I can...

379
00:23:00,001 --> 00:23:01,593
I can smell them.

380
00:23:01,801 --> 00:23:03,473
It smells so good.

381
00:23:03,721 --> 00:23:06,440
Yeah, Patrick
is very proud of them.

382
00:23:06,681 --> 00:23:09,798
I know it's stupid, but when
we were about to leave Paris,

383
00:23:10,001 --> 00:23:13,880
I was nervous to come here. Now we're
about to leave, I don't wanna go.

384
00:23:14,081 --> 00:23:16,470
Why were you nervous?
Yeah, why was that?

385
00:23:16,681 --> 00:23:20,561
This place, it's so full of thousands
of years of myth and tragedy.

386
00:23:20,722 --> 00:23:22,519
Thought something
was gonna happen.

387
00:23:22,682 --> 00:23:25,640
You thought the minotaur
was going to eat your children?

388
00:23:25,842 --> 00:23:28,640
Yes. Exactly.

389
00:23:31,522 --> 00:23:33,990
Well, I've been working
on this idea

390
00:23:34,202 --> 00:23:37,478
about a group of people
with all these brain abnormalities.

391
00:23:37,682 --> 00:23:42,631
So the book would be like a day in their
life from all their unique points of view.

392
00:23:42,842 --> 00:23:45,675
This older lady has a condition
that makes you feel

393
00:23:45,842 --> 00:23:47,798
like you're in a state of déjà vu.

394
00:23:47,962 --> 00:23:51,238
Every single experience she has
feels like she's had it before.

395
00:23:51,402 --> 00:23:54,360
She could be sitting here,
seemingly functional.

396
00:23:54,602 --> 00:23:57,753
In her head, she's thinking,
"Didn't he already say that?

397
00:23:57,962 --> 00:24:01,511
Weren't we were here yesterday
having this exact same conversation?"

398
00:24:01,722 --> 00:24:03,553
Like déjà vu.
Except all the time.

399
00:24:03,762 --> 00:24:06,720
That's the thing, right?
Everything she takes in.

400
00:24:06,922 --> 00:24:11,074
Uh, breakfast, a newspaper, a movie. She's
convinced she's encountered it already.

401
00:24:11,282 --> 00:24:15,673
That's a real condition?
Yeah, it's called, um, persistent déjà...

402
00:24:15,882 --> 00:24:17,793
It's real, but I can't pronounce it.
Ha-ha-ha.

403
00:24:18,002 --> 00:24:22,120
Then there's these two other characters
with facial recognition extremes.

404
00:24:22,322 --> 00:24:26,679
There's this one guy and he can't
recognize his wife of 20 years.

405
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:30,352
He looks at himself in the mirror,
and he feels this disconnect

406
00:24:30,602 --> 00:24:32,320
with that man he's looking at.

407
00:24:32,562 --> 00:24:36,077
Then the other character is the opposite.
A middle-aged housewife

408
00:24:36,282 --> 00:24:39,240
with exacting memory of every face
she's ever seen.

409
00:24:39,482 --> 00:24:42,315
She lives in a big city,
but to her, it's a small town.

410
00:24:42,522 --> 00:24:46,835
Like, a taxi drives past and she thinks:
"Oh, that's the driver who dropped me off

411
00:24:47,003 --> 00:24:49,153
at Place des Vosges
three Christmases ago."

412
00:24:49,323 --> 00:24:51,712
Like some old lady
walking on the street, she thinks:

413
00:24:53,083 --> 00:24:55,517
"She sat two seats down from me
on the Metro last year."

414
00:24:55,683 --> 00:24:59,642
So everyone she meets, you know,
to her, feels intimate and connected.

415
00:24:59,883 --> 00:25:01,077
I'm like the first guy.

416
00:25:01,283 --> 00:25:04,434
Like I feel connected to nothing
most of the time, man.

417
00:25:04,643 --> 00:25:07,282
Oh, Achilleas, Anna.
Hey, you guys.

418
00:25:09,163 --> 00:25:10,357
Hey, look at this kid.

419
00:25:10,563 --> 00:25:12,758
He's having the best
summer of us all.

420
00:25:20,523 --> 00:25:23,435
So you were saying
there's three characters, right?

421
00:25:23,643 --> 00:25:25,952
Not just three.
It's a whole group of people.

422
00:25:26,163 --> 00:25:29,758
I'm working on a chapter about
a young Greek man named Achilleas.

423
00:25:29,923 --> 00:25:31,834
Me?
Well, he's named after you.

424
00:25:32,043 --> 00:25:36,559
The guy is caught in a loop. All he sees
is the transient nature of everything.

425
00:25:36,763 --> 00:25:40,802
He looks out at the sea, thinks it's gonna
be dry and littered with fossils.

426
00:25:41,003 --> 00:25:42,641
Well, I don't know.

427
00:25:42,883 --> 00:25:44,475
What?
Sounds pretentious.

428
00:25:44,683 --> 00:25:47,243
It won't be pretentious.
It's gonna be funny.

429
00:25:47,443 --> 00:25:49,593
Really funny.
Like, he picks up a book

430
00:25:49,803 --> 00:25:53,193
and he wonders, "Who's gonna be
the last person to read this?"

431
00:25:53,403 --> 00:25:56,998
And that's funny? Ha-ha-ha.
Sometimes I kind of think like that.

432
00:25:57,163 --> 00:26:00,712
Okay. So he doesn't get excited
about tits, cars, booze? Nothing.

433
00:26:00,923 --> 00:26:02,322
He just thinks about death.

434
00:26:02,563 --> 00:26:05,795
Well, not so much death, right?
It's just like transformation.

435
00:26:06,004 --> 00:26:09,041
Like he's seeing too far into the future.
Okay.

436
00:26:09,284 --> 00:26:11,275
I like this idea
for a novel.

437
00:26:11,484 --> 00:26:16,114
Add a character of an old man who can't
remember what he had for breakfast,

438
00:26:16,324 --> 00:26:20,363
but can still hear the song playing
when Sheila Campbell danced topless

439
00:26:20,524 --> 00:26:23,163
on the bar at Jury's
when he was 14 years old.

440
00:26:23,364 --> 00:26:24,922
That'd work.
Okay,

441
00:26:25,124 --> 00:26:28,514
you have these people lost in time.
But what's the connection?

442
00:26:28,684 --> 00:26:31,039
Are they gonna have sex?
Don't you need that?

443
00:26:31,204 --> 00:26:34,594
It's not time they're lost in.
It's perception. That's the deal.

444
00:26:34,764 --> 00:26:38,074
No, I'm thinking of setting
the whole novel at a movie.

445
00:26:38,284 --> 00:26:42,277
Like every character comes in contact
with the film "On the Waterfront."

446
00:26:42,524 --> 00:26:44,435
Have you seen On the Waterfront?
On the Waterfront?

447
00:26:45,804 --> 00:26:47,203
Oh, with Brando? Uh-huh.
Yeah.

448
00:26:47,404 --> 00:26:51,795
Yeah, yeah. Okay, the first chapter is
opening weekend, Times Square, 1954.

449
00:26:52,004 --> 00:26:56,919
That old lady with perpetual déjà vu
walks into the matinee screening, right?

450
00:26:57,164 --> 00:27:01,635
Except the whole time she's thinking,
"Haven't I already seen this?"

451
00:27:01,844 --> 00:27:04,517
Yeah.
Another chapter is a 1979

452
00:27:04,724 --> 00:27:06,237
Paris film studies class.

453
00:27:06,444 --> 00:27:11,837
Then we have, uh, a Kazan retrospective
in Munich, 1993.

454
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:17,541
That is time. How is that not time?
Yeah, it's time. But it's more perception.

455
00:27:18,764 --> 00:27:21,483
You don't like it?
I think it's gonna be too long. Ha-ha-ha.

456
00:27:21,684 --> 00:27:23,561
Well, I like it.

457
00:27:23,764 --> 00:27:27,279
Don't listen to him. He makes bicycles.
Send it to me in galleys.

458
00:27:27,964 --> 00:27:29,000
Will do.

459
00:27:31,885 --> 00:27:34,035
Watch out.

460
00:27:39,965 --> 00:27:43,514
In France, we stuff tomatoes with
tomatoes and peppers with peppers.

461
00:27:43,685 --> 00:27:48,600
We use the same for both because of the
way it reacts differently in terms of taste.

462
00:27:48,845 --> 00:27:50,073
Okay.

463
00:27:52,285 --> 00:27:54,958
Celine, make sure you don't
stuff them too much

464
00:27:55,165 --> 00:27:57,725
because of the way
it overflows in the oven.

465
00:27:57,925 --> 00:27:59,278
Okay.
Gets nasty.

466
00:27:59,445 --> 00:28:00,719
You're doing fine, Celine.

467
00:28:00,965 --> 00:28:03,638
And, especially,
don't listen to Stefanos.

468
00:28:04,565 --> 00:28:08,353
Because he's never made this dish
before or any other dish for that matter.

469
00:28:10,605 --> 00:28:11,754
You know? I mean...

470
00:28:13,125 --> 00:28:14,399
Let go.

471
00:28:14,565 --> 00:28:16,635
Let go of me! Let go.

472
00:28:19,525 --> 00:28:21,004
You guys are fighting.
Ha-ha-ha.

473
00:28:21,245 --> 00:28:22,280
With knives?

474
00:28:22,445 --> 00:28:24,959
Okay, stop it.
Stop fighting with knives.

475
00:28:25,165 --> 00:28:28,282
We're not fighting. We're negotiating.
Yeah.

476
00:28:28,445 --> 00:28:30,356
Negotiating. That's how you call it?

477
00:28:30,565 --> 00:28:31,634
Wow.

478
00:28:36,245 --> 00:28:37,678
It's a system that we have.

479
00:28:37,885 --> 00:28:39,921
Wow. You found a system
that works for you.

480
00:28:40,085 --> 00:28:43,202
I thought it was a relationship.
I like system. That's good.

481
00:28:43,365 --> 00:28:45,276
Not too many, right?
Not too many.

482
00:28:52,886 --> 00:28:55,480
We used to have that system.
Ha-ha-ha.

483
00:29:09,046 --> 00:29:11,002
Not too far, you guys!

484
00:29:49,326 --> 00:29:53,035
I don't wanna let this meal go by without
saying thank you to everyone.

485
00:29:53,246 --> 00:29:54,918
And especially you, Patrick.

486
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:58,357
We had no idea what we were
getting into these last six weeks.

487
00:29:58,566 --> 00:30:00,602
A letter arrives from the university

488
00:30:00,846 --> 00:30:03,758
inviting us to the southern
Peloponnese of Greece

489
00:30:03,966 --> 00:30:06,082
to the guest house of a great writer?

490
00:30:06,286 --> 00:30:08,516
Sure, why not?
Ha-ha-ha.

491
00:30:09,086 --> 00:30:12,123
And then at the airport
earlier today,

492
00:30:12,326 --> 00:30:15,637
Hank says this has been
the greatest summer of his life.

493
00:30:15,847 --> 00:30:18,156
That's nice.
And I have to say the same.

494
00:30:18,407 --> 00:30:22,241
Thank you, Patrick. Not just for what
you've done for me and my family,

495
00:30:22,447 --> 00:30:25,519
but for all the ways you're
giving back. To Patrick.

496
00:30:30,847 --> 00:30:35,204
Thank you, thank you. When I first
saw you at the airport, I thought:

497
00:30:35,407 --> 00:30:38,638
"No way a man dressed like that
could be a man of letters."

498
00:30:42,927 --> 00:30:45,999
But now, now I think
I've learned your secret.

499
00:30:46,567 --> 00:30:49,081
We've had many great writers here
over the past decade.

500
00:30:49,247 --> 00:30:52,796
But never one who had a partner
more interesting than themselves.

501
00:30:52,967 --> 00:30:54,002
Oh.

502
00:30:56,207 --> 00:30:57,799
I keep telling you. Ha-ha-ha.

503
00:30:57,967 --> 00:31:01,277
And Celine,
it's been so great to have you

504
00:31:01,487 --> 00:31:04,320
and your daughters'
wonderful vitality around here.

505
00:31:04,527 --> 00:31:08,725
And I'm so happy that you were able
to meet my dear friend, Natalia.

506
00:31:08,927 --> 00:31:11,600
Whose husband Elias
was like a brother to me.

507
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:15,279
Sorry about the curtains.
Shouldn't have given cherries.

508
00:31:15,487 --> 00:31:17,762
It was my fault.
So beautiful.

509
00:31:18,007 --> 00:31:20,475
Thanks for including Anna
and me this summer.

510
00:31:20,687 --> 00:31:22,245
He usually puts me to work.

511
00:31:22,447 --> 00:31:25,996
But when I bring Anna, he lets me
sit at the table of the grown-ups.

512
00:31:26,207 --> 00:31:28,641
Hey, welcome to
the grown-ups table.

513
00:31:31,567 --> 00:31:34,559
How long have you two been together?
Since last summer.

514
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:37,805
We met one year ago in
my last few days here with Grandpa.

515
00:31:38,008 --> 00:31:41,159
Before I had to go back to Athens.
We met at my cast party.

516
00:31:41,368 --> 00:31:44,246
I was doing Shakespeare
at Epidavros. Yup.

517
00:31:44,448 --> 00:31:47,440
So who did you play?
I was Perdita in Winter's Tale.

518
00:31:47,648 --> 00:31:48,922
And she was fantastic.

519
00:31:49,168 --> 00:31:52,240
Remember, Patrick, we went to that?
Ah, Perdita.

520
00:31:52,408 --> 00:31:55,206
"When you do dance,
I wish you a wave o' the sea

521
00:31:55,408 --> 00:31:57,239
that you might ever do nothing
but that."

522
00:31:59,168 --> 00:32:03,047
The way he just performed that
was better than the guy at the play.

523
00:32:03,248 --> 00:32:05,159
People are still talking about that.

524
00:32:05,368 --> 00:32:08,121
The after-party was even better.
It's where we met.

525
00:32:08,328 --> 00:32:11,638
Yeah. I had an old BSA motorcycle.

526
00:32:12,208 --> 00:32:15,166
Nice.
We drove around all night.

527
00:32:15,368 --> 00:32:18,838
And then I had to drive her back
to the theater to get her stuff.

528
00:32:19,048 --> 00:32:21,198
And it was dawn.
I'll never forget it.

529
00:32:21,448 --> 00:32:25,726
It's outdoors and seats 12,000 people,
but it was now completely empty.

530
00:32:26,488 --> 00:32:29,127
And she was sitting way up
in the back row.

531
00:32:29,328 --> 00:32:34,356
So I went up on stage
and whispered to her...

532
00:32:34,568 --> 00:32:37,719
Acoustics there are incredible.
I could see his mouth move

533
00:32:37,968 --> 00:32:41,438
and then three seconds later,
I could hear his voice in my ear.

534
00:32:41,608 --> 00:32:43,166
What did he say?

535
00:32:45,368 --> 00:32:47,677
Oh! Okay.
Private. Private.

536
00:32:47,888 --> 00:32:51,244
And then she had to fly back to Paris
a couple of days later.

537
00:32:51,408 --> 00:32:55,083
How did you keep in touch?
We Skyped every day since then.

538
00:32:55,288 --> 00:32:59,646
When we're apart, we have a thing
of putting our laptop by the pillow

539
00:32:59,849 --> 00:33:01,487
and fall asleep together.

540
00:33:01,649 --> 00:33:03,685
Oh, that's the new romance.
Heh-heh-heh.

541
00:33:03,889 --> 00:33:06,642
And when I wake up,
the screen is usually frozen.

542
00:33:06,849 --> 00:33:10,922
And Anna's face
is in some funny position, like:

543
00:33:12,489 --> 00:33:14,366
Let me ask...
Can I ask a question?

544
00:33:14,569 --> 00:33:15,604
Please?
Yeah.

545
00:33:15,809 --> 00:33:18,448
When you guys Skype,
do you, you know...?

546
00:33:18,649 --> 00:33:21,925
Do you go a little crazy?
Oh, God, you're being so vulgar.

547
00:33:22,129 --> 00:33:24,404
I'm just being
an amateur anthropologist

548
00:33:24,609 --> 00:33:27,442
interested in virtual worlds
on a theoretical level.

549
00:33:27,649 --> 00:33:29,879
So now you're an anthropologist?
Yeah.

550
00:33:30,089 --> 00:33:33,718
For instance, the sex of the near future,
I'm not making this up,

551
00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:38,366
but is gonna be just like plugging in,
attaching something to your genitals,

552
00:33:38,609 --> 00:33:42,488
and you'll be having virtual intercourse
with anyone of your choice.

553
00:33:42,689 --> 00:33:45,487
You'll be able to program in
all your preferences.

554
00:33:45,689 --> 00:33:50,444
You'll be able to type in what you want
Marilyn Monroe to whisper in your ear.

555
00:33:50,609 --> 00:33:52,122
I might like that.

556
00:33:52,289 --> 00:33:53,802
All right. Come on.
Yes.

557
00:33:54,409 --> 00:33:56,400
Oh, thank you.
Thank you. Here, here.

558
00:33:56,609 --> 00:33:59,840
I mean, why not?
More and more of our experiences

559
00:34:00,049 --> 00:34:03,280
are going to take place
in the virtual world, you know?

560
00:34:03,449 --> 00:34:07,362
You're a writer. How are you gonna
feel when a computer can write a book

561
00:34:07,529 --> 00:34:10,202
better than War and Peace?
It'll never happen.

562
00:34:10,369 --> 00:34:13,327
It's only a question about
when it's going to happen.

563
00:34:13,529 --> 00:34:17,568
I think I'm gonna feel about it the same
way Kasparov felt when they could

564
00:34:17,729 --> 00:34:20,766
no longer compete with that computer.
Big Blue.

565
00:34:20,929 --> 00:34:23,683
Right. Nobody thought a computer
could beat our best.

566
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:27,445
"A machine lacks
that ineffable human instinct."

567
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:30,562
And then... You know,
and now we can't even compete.

568
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:34,399
I saw a documentary where they were
doing an experiment on a lab rat.

569
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:36,089
And he was wired up

570
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:39,248
and he could push a switch
and have an orgasm.

571
00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:43,887
And so the scientists were sort of
laughing at this pathetic little creature

572
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:48,129
while it ignored his food and water
and didn't do anything else.

573
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:50,002
And eventually it just died.

574
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:52,565
I mean,
I think that's the future of humanity.

575
00:34:52,810 --> 00:34:55,370
You know, just:
Ha-ha-ha.

576
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:57,441
And die.

577
00:34:57,690 --> 00:34:59,726
Well, well, maybe so,

578
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:05,004
but every generation believes that
they're witnessing the end of the world,

579
00:35:05,410 --> 00:35:07,844
but I feel that I'm
actually living it.

580
00:35:08,324 --> 00:35:10,108
Okay, I have a question
for you, Patrick.

581
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:12,794
I think a lot of people
are feeling that way.

582
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:16,160
That we're this kind of
pleasure-obsessed, porn-addled,

583
00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:19,646
materialists,
ceding our humanity to technology

584
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:22,967
at the same moment that
computers are becoming sentient.

585
00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:26,640
So, what my question is,
is this notion of self to begin with.

586
00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:30,678
Well, it's written over the portals
to the temple of Apollo at Delphi.

587
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:34,923
It says, "gnothi seauton,"
which means "Know thyself."

588
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:37,598
But we're kind of 99 percent
automated already.

589
00:35:37,810 --> 00:35:40,882
No. Our personality
or this thing we think of as ourself

590
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:43,644
is a tiny fraction
of what the brain is doing.

591
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:47,121
Most of it is automated body functions.
What is it we're ceding?

592
00:35:47,371 --> 00:35:51,205
No, if this notion of self is such
a small percentage of you, sweetie,

593
00:35:51,451 --> 00:35:53,726
how come I always hear
so much about it?

594
00:35:53,931 --> 00:35:57,890
Well, just like my penis. It's not
that big. It's a small part of myself,

595
00:35:58,131 --> 00:36:01,043
but it needs a lot of attention.
His too.

596
00:36:01,211 --> 00:36:03,600
Ha-ha-ha.
And how did you two meet?

597
00:36:03,811 --> 00:36:05,324
You don't know?
What?

598
00:36:05,531 --> 00:36:07,203
You have to read Jesse's books.

599
00:36:07,411 --> 00:36:10,801
If you wanna know what it's like
to have sex with me, read away.

600
00:36:10,971 --> 00:36:13,963
Read away.
Oh, excuse me, Stefanos.

601
00:36:14,171 --> 00:36:16,287
No, no. I mean it's well-written.
Ha-ha-ha.

602
00:36:16,491 --> 00:36:18,846
Yeah. Thank you.
We met about 18 years ago.

603
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:22,441
We kind of, sort of fell in love
a little bit, and then we...

604
00:36:22,691 --> 00:36:27,207
A bit. Then we lost track of each other.
A decade later, we ran into each other.

605
00:36:27,451 --> 00:36:29,726
We didn't run into each other.
We didn't?

606
00:36:29,931 --> 00:36:32,604
No. You wrote a book "inspired"
by our meeting.

607
00:36:32,811 --> 00:36:35,848
Yeah.
I read about it and went to look for him.

608
00:36:36,051 --> 00:36:37,530
Pretty romantic.
It was.

609
00:36:37,731 --> 00:36:40,370
Not really. Not really.
He neglects to mention

610
00:36:40,571 --> 00:36:42,721
he was married, had a kid...
Details.

611
00:36:42,931 --> 00:36:44,489
That part was a disaster.

612
00:36:44,691 --> 00:36:46,727
It wasn't. It was inevitable.
Yeah.

613
00:36:46,971 --> 00:36:49,610
The first time we have sex
without a condom, twins.

614
00:36:49,771 --> 00:36:53,161
I've been chained to the sink ever since.
One pitch, two-run homer. Boom.

615
00:36:53,331 --> 00:36:55,845
It's not that bad.
The girls are so beautiful.

616
00:36:56,051 --> 00:36:58,770
They're cute.
Ha-ha-ha.

617
00:36:58,931 --> 00:37:01,684
Okay. No, no.
It has some upsides, okay.

618
00:37:01,891 --> 00:37:04,564
Let me tell you right now, Anna,
how to keep a man.

619
00:37:04,771 --> 00:37:05,965
You gotta let them win

620
00:37:06,131 --> 00:37:08,851
at all the silly little games they like.
Oh, okay.

621
00:37:09,052 --> 00:37:12,044
When I met Jesse, we were playing
pinball. I was winning.

622
00:37:12,212 --> 00:37:14,442
The foundational lie
to our relationship.

623
00:37:14,652 --> 00:37:17,610
I let the ball go down the middle.
She can't beat me.

624
00:37:17,772 --> 00:37:19,205
It builds their confidence.

625
00:37:19,372 --> 00:37:23,331
If I didn't let him win at every game,
we would never have sex.

626
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:27,525
I mean, I'm sorry to say it,
but he's actually a closet macho.

627
00:37:27,732 --> 00:37:29,768
He dreams of having a bimbo
for a wife.

628
00:37:30,012 --> 00:37:33,800
It's my greatest aspiration, a bimbo.
Dreams.

629
00:37:35,412 --> 00:37:36,481
Whoa.

630
00:37:37,172 --> 00:37:39,367
So...
Uh-oh.

631
00:37:40,332 --> 00:37:42,288
Yes.
Ha-ha-ha.

632
00:37:42,452 --> 00:37:44,602
So you're a writer?

633
00:37:46,412 --> 00:37:48,004
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

634
00:37:48,212 --> 00:37:51,090
So you write, like, books?

635
00:37:53,532 --> 00:37:55,762
I've written a few, sure.
Sure, yeah.

636
00:37:55,932 --> 00:37:59,527
Wow.
I've never met a writer before.

637
00:37:59,732 --> 00:38:03,407
No?
You must be really smart.

638
00:38:03,572 --> 00:38:07,451
You know, I can't even write my own
name sometimes when I'm tired.

639
00:38:07,612 --> 00:38:10,445
Aw. What kind of books
do you like, huh?

640
00:38:11,012 --> 00:38:13,924
Well, I like stories
with a meaning behind it.

641
00:38:14,132 --> 00:38:17,044
Like a really beautiful love story.
Oh, sure, yeah.

642
00:38:17,252 --> 00:38:21,211
You know, I read this book once,
uh, Romeo and...

643
00:38:21,372 --> 00:38:22,691
Juliet.

644
00:38:23,332 --> 00:38:25,004
Right?
Yeah.

645
00:38:25,172 --> 00:38:26,446
Oh, yeah.
Wow. You know it.

646
00:38:26,652 --> 00:38:30,281
It's very good. It's a play, actually.
It's not a book, a play.

647
00:38:30,532 --> 00:38:32,728
I thought it was a book
based on the movie.

648
00:38:32,893 --> 00:38:34,963
Ha-ha-ha.
No. No, a play. Yeah.

649
00:38:35,173 --> 00:38:37,846
Okay, it was a play. Wow.
Ha-ha-ha.

650
00:38:38,013 --> 00:38:40,971
Well, I didn't read the whole thing
because sometimes

651
00:38:41,133 --> 00:38:43,647
I have to keep up
and read those magazines

652
00:38:43,853 --> 00:38:46,526
to know what's going on
in those people's lives.

653
00:38:46,733 --> 00:38:50,089
Well, that is important.
Okay, well, you're very, very smart.

654
00:38:50,293 --> 00:38:54,650
And I bet you have a gigantic penis.

655
00:38:54,893 --> 00:38:59,250
Why am I finding myself
so attracted to this woman?

656
00:38:59,453 --> 00:39:02,809
For real! And that's the funny
part of it.

657
00:39:03,013 --> 00:39:06,642
The not-so-funny part
of the closet macho, okay,

658
00:39:06,853 --> 00:39:11,165
is today, after we dropped Henry off,
he tells me even though I have an offer

659
00:39:11,333 --> 00:39:14,166
for an amazing job,
he wants me to move to Chicago.

660
00:39:14,333 --> 00:39:19,691
That's not what I said. I missed him.
So we can babysit for his ex-wife.

661
00:39:19,853 --> 00:39:21,809
I thought I was in a...
Hey, stop it.

662
00:39:21,973 --> 00:39:24,362
It must have been hard
saying goodbye to Hank.

663
00:39:24,573 --> 00:39:26,928
Yeah, of course.
He's such an amazing kid.

664
00:39:27,173 --> 00:39:30,210
Tell him I miss my chess partner.
I will.

665
00:39:30,373 --> 00:39:33,604
When Stefanos and I split up,
I'm getting full custody.

666
00:39:33,773 --> 00:39:35,968
Oh. That's okay for a while

667
00:39:36,173 --> 00:39:39,290
because me and my 20-year-old
girlfriend will be a little bit preoccupied.

668
00:39:40,653 --> 00:39:42,644
- I love men.
- And I love you.

669
00:39:42,893 --> 00:39:43,882
Aw...

670
00:39:46,693 --> 00:39:49,969
Okay, I have a story
that my husband here loves.

671
00:39:50,173 --> 00:39:54,292
Gonna tell you everything you need
to know about masculine and feminine.

672
00:39:54,534 --> 00:39:55,569
Okay.
Okay, ready?

673
00:39:55,774 --> 00:39:58,447
Yeah.
My mom used to be a nurse,

674
00:39:58,654 --> 00:40:02,090
so she was there when people
were coming out of their coma.

675
00:40:02,294 --> 00:40:04,012
Oh, that story. I'm listening.
Listen.

676
00:40:04,254 --> 00:40:06,609
It's an interesting story.
I'm listening.

677
00:40:06,814 --> 00:40:09,772
So she was the one to tell them:

678
00:40:09,974 --> 00:40:14,411
"Hi. My name's Katerina.
You're coming out of a coma.

679
00:40:15,814 --> 00:40:19,204
You've been in a really bad
automobile accident,

680
00:40:19,414 --> 00:40:21,723
but you're gonna be okay.

681
00:40:22,334 --> 00:40:24,928
You're gonna be fine."
You know, stuff like that.

682
00:40:25,134 --> 00:40:28,683
She said that every woman,
the very first thing,

683
00:40:28,894 --> 00:40:32,853
the first reaction she would have,
would be to ask about everyone else.

684
00:40:33,014 --> 00:40:35,733
"How are my kids?
How's my husband?

685
00:40:36,334 --> 00:40:37,847
Is anyone else hurt?"

686
00:40:38,054 --> 00:40:43,412
Every man, with no exception,
when they were told this,

687
00:40:43,614 --> 00:40:46,367
what was the first thing they did?

688
00:40:46,574 --> 00:40:47,802
Look down at their cock.

689
00:40:50,134 --> 00:40:52,932
You know what?
You gotta make sure it's still there.

690
00:40:53,174 --> 00:40:55,210
You gotta make sure
it's still working.

691
00:40:55,414 --> 00:40:57,370
Alive and kicking.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

692
00:40:57,574 --> 00:41:02,409
And only eventually they'd come
around to asking about their kids

693
00:41:02,614 --> 00:41:05,731
or about someone else
they might've accidentally killed.

694
00:41:05,934 --> 00:41:07,003
Stuff like that.

695
00:41:07,214 --> 00:41:10,604
Doesn't that say it all?
Penis first, then the rest of the world.

696
00:41:10,814 --> 00:41:12,327
Penis, penis, penis...

697
00:41:12,574 --> 00:41:14,053
Okay, okay. Whoa, whoa.

698
00:41:14,254 --> 00:41:17,247
But if you can explain it all
on strictly gender terms,

699
00:41:17,495 --> 00:41:20,965
why do you, or why does any woman,
waste time getting mad at

700
00:41:21,175 --> 00:41:25,373
or bother trying to change a man?
If it's all biology, what is the problem?

701
00:41:25,575 --> 00:41:28,043
And you're so good
at turning things around.

702
00:41:28,295 --> 00:41:32,004
No, I mean, like, he's a genius.
It's like getting pissed at a frog

703
00:41:32,215 --> 00:41:34,365
for being green.
Yes. Exactly.

704
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:39,091
Hearing all this, I wonder if this idea
of love affair that lasts forever

705
00:41:39,295 --> 00:41:40,728
is still relevant to us.

706
00:41:40,975 --> 00:41:44,445
I mean, we know that we are going
to break up eventually.

707
00:41:44,655 --> 00:41:47,249
Definitely.
Are your parents still together?

708
00:41:47,455 --> 00:41:49,173
No way.
No? And what about you?

709
00:41:49,375 --> 00:41:52,253
They are. But they could be divorced.
They could be.

710
00:41:52,415 --> 00:41:55,930
I think if they had more money,
they wouldn't still be together.

711
00:41:56,135 --> 00:42:00,651
God, you guys are so practical.
I was born into the wrong generation.

712
00:42:00,855 --> 00:42:04,165
My grandmother's mother
wrote to our whole family

713
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:07,293
a 26-page letter from her deathbed.

714
00:42:07,495 --> 00:42:10,965
And she spent three pages
on the costumes she did for a play

715
00:42:11,215 --> 00:42:14,287
and one paragraph on her husband.
She an actress too?

716
00:42:14,495 --> 00:42:16,850
No, she was a, um...
She was a...

717
00:42:18,535 --> 00:42:21,493
Seamstress. A seamstress.
Seamstress.

718
00:42:21,695 --> 00:42:23,970
And she had
all these wonderful friends.

719
00:42:24,175 --> 00:42:28,134
And about my great-grandfather,
she mentioned three events.

720
00:42:28,335 --> 00:42:31,771
He went to the war, we moved
because of his job, and he died.

721
00:42:34,215 --> 00:42:38,003
Her big advice was to not to be
too consumed with romantic love.

722
00:42:38,215 --> 00:42:42,255
Friendships and work, she said,
brought her the most happiness.

723
00:42:42,456 --> 00:42:43,889
I couldn't agree more.

724
00:42:44,096 --> 00:42:46,451
I mean,
that's the thing that fucks us up.

725
00:42:46,656 --> 00:42:50,888
This idea of a soul mate, of someone
who will come to complete us

726
00:42:51,096 --> 00:42:54,452
and save us from
having to take care of ourselves.

727
00:42:54,656 --> 00:42:56,965
With Stefanos,
I set the bar extremely low.

728
00:42:58,376 --> 00:43:00,332
I know he's not gonna meet
any of my needs.

729
00:43:00,536 --> 00:43:01,855
Definitely not.

730
00:43:02,096 --> 00:43:04,052
What about Grandma?
Was she soul mate?

731
00:43:04,256 --> 00:43:08,534
Well, sounds appealing, but actually your
grandmother was more rational than that.

732
00:43:08,736 --> 00:43:11,534
She took care of herself
and asked me to do the same.

733
00:43:11,776 --> 00:43:14,051
We had plenty of room
to meet in the middle.

734
00:43:14,256 --> 00:43:17,134
Yeah. That sounds ideal.
That is, actually. It is.

735
00:43:17,336 --> 00:43:19,896
But it must be obvious
my wife is not here today.

736
00:43:20,096 --> 00:43:23,884
We were never one person. Always two.
We preferred it that way.

737
00:43:24,456 --> 00:43:26,412
That's so beautiful.

738
00:43:26,616 --> 00:43:30,689
I think my husband is always trying
to almost colonize me, you know?

739
00:43:31,376 --> 00:43:33,014
I colonize you?

740
00:43:34,336 --> 00:43:38,329
Yes, but I colonize you too, darling.
Oh. Okay.

741
00:43:38,536 --> 00:43:40,128
But at the end of the day,

742
00:43:40,656 --> 00:43:44,934
it's not the love of one other person
that matters, it's the love of life.

743
00:43:45,136 --> 00:43:47,855
That's good to know,
because life, I can handle.

744
00:43:48,056 --> 00:43:51,844
Ariadni, on the other hand. we all
know the Greeks invented tragedy.

745
00:43:52,056 --> 00:43:54,775
And on top of that,
she's from the region of Mani,

746
00:43:54,976 --> 00:43:56,887
which is short for maniac.

747
00:43:59,936 --> 00:44:02,246
Ask them about the hotel.

748
00:44:03,297 --> 00:44:08,052
If we can't make that hotel room tonight,
could you get a refund or use it yourself?

749
00:44:08,257 --> 00:44:11,852
No, we don't get a refund, man.
Are you trying to get out of it?

750
00:44:12,057 --> 00:44:15,094
It's such a great gift,
but I'm so stressed

751
00:44:15,337 --> 00:44:17,453
getting all the packing ready...
No.

752
00:44:17,657 --> 00:44:20,888
We made a deal, guys. We watch
the kids. You're gonna love it.

753
00:44:21,097 --> 00:44:23,133
We're gonna watch yours.
Really good.

754
00:44:23,337 --> 00:44:26,932
It's a fantastic walk to the hotel.
And you want to grab it.

755
00:44:27,137 --> 00:44:29,412
And we'll be very offended
if you don't go.

756
00:44:29,617 --> 00:44:31,448
Okay. Thank you.

757
00:44:31,617 --> 00:44:33,528
Mm.
You're going.

758
00:44:34,337 --> 00:44:36,293
Well, when I think of Elias,

759
00:44:36,497 --> 00:44:39,250
what I miss the most about him

760
00:44:39,457 --> 00:44:42,733
is the way he used to lie down
next to me at night.

761
00:44:42,937 --> 00:44:46,976
Sometimes his arm would stretch
along my chest.

762
00:44:47,177 --> 00:44:52,456
And I couldn't move.
I even held my breath.

763
00:44:52,657 --> 00:44:54,727
But I felt safe.

764
00:44:55,777 --> 00:44:57,574
Complete.

765
00:44:58,417 --> 00:45:03,093
And I miss the way he was whistling
walking down the street.

766
00:45:03,297 --> 00:45:06,494
And every time I do something,
I think of what he would say:

767
00:45:06,697 --> 00:45:10,007
"It's cold today. Wear a scarf." Heh.

768
00:45:10,417 --> 00:45:16,413
But lately,
I've been forgetting little things.

769
00:45:16,617 --> 00:45:21,532
He's sort of fading
and I'm starting to forget him,

770
00:45:21,777 --> 00:45:26,772
and it's like losing him again.

771
00:45:26,978 --> 00:45:32,848
So sometimes, I make myself
remember every detail of his face.

772
00:45:33,058 --> 00:45:37,336
The exact color of his eyes,
his lips, his teeth,

773
00:45:37,538 --> 00:45:40,928
the texture of his skin, his hair.

774
00:45:41,698 --> 00:45:44,895
That was all gone by the time he went.

775
00:45:45,658 --> 00:45:47,171
And sometimes...
Not always.

776
00:45:47,338 --> 00:45:48,976
But sometimes

777
00:45:49,178 --> 00:45:51,294
I can actually see him.

778
00:45:51,498 --> 00:45:54,296
It's as if a cloud moves away
and there he is.

779
00:45:54,498 --> 00:45:55,977
I could almost touch him.

780
00:45:56,912 --> 00:46:02,380
But then the real world rushes in,
and he vanishes again.

781
00:46:03,338 --> 00:46:05,806
For a while,
I did this every morning

782
00:46:06,018 --> 00:46:08,293
when the sun
was not too bright outside.

783
00:46:08,538 --> 00:46:12,213
The sun somehow
makes him vanish.

784
00:46:13,598 --> 00:46:19,337
Yes, he appears and he disappears,
like a sunrise or sunset.

785
00:46:19,538 --> 00:46:22,769
Anything so ephemeral.

786
00:46:23,738 --> 00:46:26,650
Eh, just like our life. Hm?

787
00:46:26,858 --> 00:46:30,533
We appear and we disappear.

788
00:46:30,738 --> 00:46:33,935
And we are so important to some,

789
00:46:34,258 --> 00:46:38,774
but we are just passing through.

790
00:46:41,938 --> 00:46:44,930
To passing through.
To passing through.

791
00:46:45,138 --> 00:46:47,528
- To passing through.
- To passing through.

792
00:46:56,499 --> 00:46:59,935
And eventually he catches his face
in the window's reflection.

793
00:47:00,139 --> 00:47:02,607
He realizes he's no longer
a 9-year-old boy.

794
00:47:02,819 --> 00:47:05,811
He's suddenly old. He's got
a beard, his eyes are watery.

795
00:47:06,019 --> 00:47:09,648
This one seems sad. I thought you
were gonna tell me about the guy

796
00:47:09,859 --> 00:47:12,214
that has an imaginary friend.
Which one?

797
00:47:12,419 --> 00:47:13,568
When he's in his 50's,

798
00:47:13,779 --> 00:47:16,247
imaginary friend shows up again.
Hummingbird?

799
00:47:16,459 --> 00:47:19,132
That one. It's funny.
Yeah. You like that one? Oh.

800
00:47:19,339 --> 00:47:22,058
Remember that letter
that you let me read

801
00:47:22,259 --> 00:47:25,012
that you wrote when you were 20
to yourself at 40?

802
00:47:25,219 --> 00:47:28,655
I remember. "Dear 40-year-old Jesse,
I hope you're not divorced."

803
00:47:28,859 --> 00:47:32,693
I didn't remember that part.
I meant all the other things in that letter.

804
00:47:32,899 --> 00:47:33,968
You're the same guy.

805
00:47:34,179 --> 00:47:37,728
We always think we're evolving,
but we can't change that much.

806
00:47:37,899 --> 00:47:40,367
Know how I think I've changed the most?
How?

807
00:47:40,539 --> 00:47:43,212
When I was younger,
I just wanted time to speed up.

808
00:47:43,379 --> 00:47:45,176
Why?
So I could be on my own,

809
00:47:45,379 --> 00:47:47,973
be freed from parents, school,
all that shit.

810
00:47:48,219 --> 00:47:51,336
I just wanted to close my eyes
and wake up and be an adult.

811
00:47:51,539 --> 00:47:54,531
Now I feel that happened, and I
just want everything to slow down.

812
00:47:54,699 --> 00:47:58,612
Mm. I've always had this feeling
no matter where I am in my life

813
00:47:58,859 --> 00:48:02,488
that it's either a memory or a dream.
You've always thought that.

814
00:48:02,739 --> 00:48:06,891
Me too. Like, is this really my life?
Like, is it happening right now?

815
00:48:07,099 --> 00:48:08,851
It is. Ha-ha-ha.
I know. Heh, heh.

816
00:48:09,059 --> 00:48:12,609
Every year, I seem to get a bit
more humbled and more overwhelmed

817
00:48:12,820 --> 00:48:15,493
about things I'm never gonna
know or understand.

818
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:19,136
I keep telling you, you know nothing.
I know. I'm coming around.

819
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:21,052
But not knowing is not so bad.

820
00:48:21,220 --> 00:48:26,419
I mean, the point is to be looking,
searching, to stay hungry, right?

821
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:29,180
It's true.
I just wish it was a little easier.

822
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:30,654
How do you mean?

823
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:33,738
Just to maintain a certain level
of passion, you know?

824
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:36,215
I mean,
it used to come so naturally.

825
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:40,129
I remember when I was younger,
me and all my writer friends, we, like...

826
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:43,810
It felt like we were doing something
important. This was our time.

827
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:46,375
But you were all arrogant
little pricks.

828
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:48,417
Heh. No. Well... All right, maybe.
Ha-ha-ha.

829
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:52,130
I don't know. It grew out
of all this energy and this creativity

830
00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:54,331
or whatever ambitions people had.

831
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:58,459
I think you gotta be a little deluded
to stay motivated.

832
00:48:58,660 --> 00:49:01,697
Young men have this thing
about comparing themselves.

833
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:05,017
They have all these signposts
they judge themself by.

834
00:49:05,260 --> 00:49:07,535
You used to do that all the time.
Do what?

835
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:10,208
It was like, uh,
"Rimbaud wrote this by 17"

836
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:14,658
Oh, yeah, definitely. Balzac wrote a book
before breakfast, so what am I doing?

837
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:17,852
Women don't think that way as much.
You don't think so?

838
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:20,819
No. We have much less
to compare ourselves to maybe.

839
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:25,417
Women who achieve anything, first time
you hear about them, they're in their 50s.

840
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:28,771
It was so hard for them
to get any recognitions before then.

841
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:32,177
They struggled for 30 years
or they raised kids

842
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:36,215
and were stranded at home before
they could finally do what they want.

843
00:49:36,381 --> 00:49:40,454
Actually, you know, it's kind of freeing.
We don't have to spend our lives

844
00:49:40,621 --> 00:49:42,577
comparing ourselves
to Martin Luther King,

845
00:49:42,741 --> 00:49:44,220
Ha-ha-ha.
Gandhi, Tolstoy.

846
00:49:44,461 --> 00:49:46,019
What about Joan of Arc, right?

847
00:49:46,181 --> 00:49:49,218
I mean, she was a teenager,
and she saved France, so...

848
00:49:49,421 --> 00:49:51,776
Who wants to be Joan of Arc?
Forget France.

849
00:49:51,981 --> 00:49:54,336
She was burned at the stake
and a virgin, okay?

850
00:49:54,501 --> 00:49:56,731
Ha-ha-ha. Okay.
Nothing I aspire to.

851
00:49:56,941 --> 00:49:59,739
What a great achievement.
Ha-ha-ha.

852
00:50:01,261 --> 00:50:02,740
Oh, God.
What?

853
00:50:03,021 --> 00:50:04,170
No, nothing.

854
00:50:04,381 --> 00:50:07,737
What?
This is so weird. Ha, ha.

855
00:50:08,141 --> 00:50:10,211
What do you mean?
Just this.

856
00:50:10,421 --> 00:50:13,299
Us, walking,
having a conversation

857
00:50:13,501 --> 00:50:16,254
about something else
than scheduling, food, work.

858
00:50:16,461 --> 00:50:20,249
Yeah, how long's it been since we
just wandered around bullshitting?

859
00:50:21,101 --> 00:50:23,217
Do you hear what I hear?

860
00:50:23,821 --> 00:50:25,732
The sea?
No.

861
00:50:26,021 --> 00:50:29,093
What? Oh, no small feet.
Mm-hm.

862
00:50:29,301 --> 00:50:32,373
No... Nothing being knocked over,
nothing we have to clean up,

863
00:50:32,581 --> 00:50:34,378
no injustices being done.

864
00:50:34,581 --> 00:50:37,891
Yeah. So when was the last time?
Mm.

865
00:50:38,181 --> 00:50:41,139
When we had nowhere we had to be?
Yeah.

866
00:50:41,781 --> 00:50:44,056
Remember Luxembourg Gardens?
Yeah.

867
00:50:44,261 --> 00:50:47,094
Used to kick your ass at Ping-Pong?
Congratulations.

868
00:50:47,261 --> 00:50:49,172
You beat a woman pregnant
with twins.

869
00:50:49,341 --> 00:50:52,219
It's better than losing
to a pregnant woman with twins.

870
00:50:52,381 --> 00:50:54,736
Okay? Heh, heh.
Oh, God.

871
00:50:54,901 --> 00:50:56,255
You know what I think?

872
00:50:56,422 --> 00:51:00,381
From the time we leave our parents'
house until we have kids.

873
00:51:00,622 --> 00:51:03,455
That's the only time your life
is completely your own.

874
00:51:03,662 --> 00:51:05,937
I had about a decade of that.
It was great.

875
00:51:06,142 --> 00:51:08,337
It was just like one long flowing...

876
00:51:08,502 --> 00:51:10,379
A day, a week, a year.

877
00:51:10,582 --> 00:51:13,733
There wasn't much difference.
I used to keep track of time.

878
00:51:13,902 --> 00:51:17,895
Through jobs, boyfriends, stuff like that.
Now I can tell you every detail

879
00:51:18,102 --> 00:51:21,777
of the past seven years based on
what was happening in the girls' lives.

880
00:51:21,982 --> 00:51:22,971
Yeah, right. Totally.

881
00:51:23,142 --> 00:51:25,019
You do that too?

882
00:51:25,262 --> 00:51:28,015
Yeah. I mean, time's demarcated now.
Really?

883
00:51:28,182 --> 00:51:29,774
What?
No, no, no. No, I just...

884
00:51:29,982 --> 00:51:33,611
I'm surprised. I'm surprised you do that.
No, but... Okay, quick test.

885
00:51:33,862 --> 00:51:36,092
Oh, no.
You know, August, 2009.

886
00:51:36,262 --> 00:51:39,413
No, August... Come on. It's a quick one.
Why?

887
00:51:39,662 --> 00:51:41,573
What was happening?
August...

888
00:51:41,742 --> 00:51:43,733
We were on vacation
with your parents.

889
00:51:43,902 --> 00:51:46,974
Nina got the chicken pox first,
quickly followed by Ella.

890
00:51:47,182 --> 00:51:50,094
I'm so impressed.
So do I get a gold star?

891
00:51:50,342 --> 00:51:52,253
Maybe.
Mm-hm.

892
00:51:53,102 --> 00:51:55,696
Hey, can I ask you a question?
Sure.

893
00:51:55,902 --> 00:52:00,373
If we were meeting for the first time today
on a train, would you find me attractive?

894
00:52:00,582 --> 00:52:03,380
Of course.
No, but really, right now, as I am?

895
00:52:03,582 --> 00:52:05,812
Would you start talking to me?

896
00:52:06,062 --> 00:52:08,576
Would you ask me
to get off the train with you?

897
00:52:10,022 --> 00:52:12,980
Well, I mean, you're asking
a theoretical question.

898
00:52:13,182 --> 00:52:16,891
What would my life situation be?
Wouldn't I be cheating on you?

899
00:52:17,102 --> 00:52:18,934
Why can't you just say yes?
I did.

900
00:52:19,143 --> 00:52:22,101
I wanted you to say something
romantic and you blew it.

901
00:52:22,303 --> 00:52:25,261
Okay, all right, wait,
if I saw you on a train,

902
00:52:25,503 --> 00:52:28,017
I would lock eyes with you, walk up to you
Uh-huh.

903
00:52:28,183 --> 00:52:29,457
and say, "Hey, baby.

904
00:52:29,623 --> 00:52:32,535
You are making me as horny
as a billy goat in a pepper patch."

905
00:52:32,703 --> 00:52:35,217
Aah! Stop it! That's disgusting!

906
00:52:35,423 --> 00:52:39,621
Billy goat? No. The truth is,
okay, you failed the test.

907
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:42,383
The fact is, you would not
pick me up on a train.

908
00:52:42,583 --> 00:52:45,051
Would not notice
a fat-assed middle-aged mom

909
00:52:45,263 --> 00:52:48,255
losing her hair.
Okay. Losing... Ha-ha-ha.

910
00:52:48,423 --> 00:52:49,458
Yeah, that's me.

911
00:52:49,663 --> 00:52:51,938
You set me up to fail on this one.

912
00:52:52,143 --> 00:52:54,498
Okay, true, true, true.
You did. All right.

913
00:52:54,743 --> 00:52:59,100
But in the real world, baldy, okay,
on game day when it mattered,

914
00:52:59,303 --> 00:53:03,615
I did talk to you on a train, okay?
I did. It was the best thing I ever did.

915
00:53:03,823 --> 00:53:05,541
Really? Look at the goats.
Hey.

916
00:53:05,743 --> 00:53:07,574
- Hello.
- Yeah.

917
00:53:08,623 --> 00:53:12,616
But, heh, you know,
that's not even a good question.

918
00:53:12,823 --> 00:53:17,055
The real question would be,
if I did ask you to get off a train,

919
00:53:17,303 --> 00:53:19,214
Yeah?
would you get off with me?

920
00:53:19,423 --> 00:53:21,698
Of course not.
I have people waiting for me.

921
00:53:21,903 --> 00:53:26,613
You know, and, heh, heh,
a 41-year-old horny billy goat.

922
00:53:26,823 --> 00:53:30,452
How creepy. I'm creeped out
right now. Help!

923
00:53:30,663 --> 00:53:32,619
I can't believe I'm 41.

924
00:53:32,863 --> 00:53:35,172
Yeah, me neither. You've gotten so old.
Heh.

925
00:53:35,383 --> 00:53:37,772
I never thought I'd sleep
with anyone over 40.

926
00:53:37,983 --> 00:53:40,736
Actually, you're the oldest guy
I've ever slept with.

927
00:53:40,943 --> 00:53:44,254
That's something. I'm not the
oldest guy you've ever blown.

928
00:53:44,464 --> 00:53:45,783
What?

929
00:53:45,984 --> 00:53:48,498
That conference in Warsaw.

930
00:53:48,744 --> 00:53:51,053
What conference?
Lech Walesa.

931
00:53:51,264 --> 00:53:52,856
Lech Walesa?

932
00:53:53,024 --> 00:53:55,094
Oh, what are you talking about?
It's okay.

933
00:53:55,304 --> 00:53:58,262
It was before we were together.
It's... You can admit it.

934
00:53:58,464 --> 00:54:02,742
I can remember the way you talked
about how he opened your heart.

935
00:54:02,944 --> 00:54:06,619
You definitely blew him. Definitely.
Oh, okay. You're really crazy.

936
00:54:06,824 --> 00:54:10,134
That was Gorbachev, okay,
you geographically-challenged,

937
00:54:10,344 --> 00:54:13,859
football-obsessed, doughnut-loving
American. That was Gorbachev.

938
00:54:14,064 --> 00:54:16,100
I got my Eastern bloc leaders
mixed up.

939
00:54:16,304 --> 00:54:17,453
And I didn't blow him

940
00:54:17,664 --> 00:54:20,303
at all. Okay? Take it back.
Okay, okay, okay.

941
00:54:20,504 --> 00:54:22,062
God.

942
00:54:23,064 --> 00:54:25,180
So was it Vaclav Havel?

943
00:54:25,384 --> 00:54:27,614
All right, you know...
Heh, heh.

944
00:54:29,064 --> 00:54:31,624
Listen to this. I was gonna wait
to tell you this

945
00:54:31,784 --> 00:54:34,662
till later, but I'm so bad
with secrets.

946
00:54:34,864 --> 00:54:37,014
You have a tumor
in your brain? Gonna die?

947
00:54:37,224 --> 00:54:39,533
No, no, no.
Nothing like that. All right?

948
00:54:39,704 --> 00:54:43,219
Well, actually,
it's kind of like that. Um...

949
00:54:43,384 --> 00:54:44,499
My grandmother died.

950
00:54:44,704 --> 00:54:47,901
What? When?
Yeah. My dad texted me before we ate.

951
00:54:48,144 --> 00:54:50,135
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Why didn't you tell me?

952
00:54:50,304 --> 00:54:54,013
Everybody's been expecting it.
She lived a long time, had a great life.

953
00:54:54,184 --> 00:54:55,856
She was 96.

954
00:54:56,024 --> 00:54:58,697
Hm. Didn't live much longer
after your grandfather died?

955
00:54:58,904 --> 00:55:00,053
Barely a year.

956
00:55:00,224 --> 00:55:03,773
I mean, the funny thing is, this woman was
a freaking saint. Okay?

957
00:55:03,944 --> 00:55:06,937
She was a nurse in the war.
She took care of all of us.

958
00:55:07,145 --> 00:55:10,182
I mean, she never said an unkind
word about anybody.

959
00:55:10,385 --> 00:55:12,182
I wish I'd met her.
It's okay.

960
00:55:12,385 --> 00:55:16,344
It's okay. By the end, she just really
wasn't into meeting new people.

961
00:55:16,545 --> 00:55:19,935
I mean, after a lifetime
of being sweet as pie,

962
00:55:20,145 --> 00:55:22,943
once Grandpa died,
she got kind of ornery.

963
00:55:23,185 --> 00:55:24,174
It happens.

964
00:55:24,345 --> 00:55:25,380
She was in mourning, no?

965
00:55:25,545 --> 00:55:29,299
Well, my dad said
she was just waiting to die.

966
00:55:29,505 --> 00:55:32,463
How long were they married?
Seventy-four years.

967
00:55:32,665 --> 00:55:36,101
Fuck. How is that even possible?
Ha-ha-ha.

968
00:55:36,305 --> 00:55:37,579
I know.

969
00:55:37,785 --> 00:55:40,618
How old will we be
if we are together 74 years?

970
00:55:40,825 --> 00:55:43,737
Um, when would we start
counting from?

971
00:55:43,945 --> 00:55:48,063
I guess from the first time we had sex.
Okay. Yeah, good.

972
00:55:48,265 --> 00:55:51,337
Okay.
So, um, 1994.

973
00:55:51,585 --> 00:55:53,143
Okay, '94.

974
00:55:55,505 --> 00:55:59,498
Fifty-six years from now.
Yeah. We will be 98.

975
00:55:59,665 --> 00:56:00,859
Oh!

976
00:56:02,305 --> 00:56:05,502
Will you be able to put up with me
for another 56 more years?

977
00:56:05,705 --> 00:56:08,458
I don't know if I'm gonna be able
to put up with you.

978
00:56:08,625 --> 00:56:11,219
It's crazy if you think about
the change they saw.

979
00:56:11,385 --> 00:56:13,819
When they met,
neither of them had electricity.

980
00:56:14,025 --> 00:56:16,220
He used to take her to school
on his horse.

981
00:56:16,425 --> 00:56:17,699
So romantic.
I know.

982
00:56:17,945 --> 00:56:20,300
He was valedictorian
and she was salutatorian.

983
00:56:20,505 --> 00:56:21,540
What is that?

984
00:56:21,705 --> 00:56:23,821
Um, he was top of the class.
She was second.

985
00:56:23,985 --> 00:56:27,661
She got a couple answers wrong to
make sure he didn't feel threatened.

986
00:56:27,826 --> 00:56:31,455
If she wanted to get laid, she better have.
Yeah, like you know who.

987
00:56:32,005 --> 00:56:35,354
All right. Anyway, so I called
my dad after I got the text,

988
00:56:35,688 --> 00:56:39,227
just to tell him I was sorry,
but I think I screwed up.

989
00:56:39,262 --> 00:56:41,586
At some point I told him,
"You're an orphan now."

990
00:56:41,786 --> 00:56:44,095
You know, and he didn't think
that was funny.

991
00:56:44,306 --> 00:56:46,774
No, it's not funny at all.
Yeah, I guess not. Heh, heh.

992
00:56:46,946 --> 00:56:48,538
He's next, then you.
I know.

993
00:56:48,746 --> 00:56:52,375
Well, he told me that my grandparents
wanna have a joint service.

994
00:56:52,546 --> 00:56:56,380
Right? They wanna have their ashes
intermingled and be buried as one.

995
00:56:56,546 --> 00:56:58,343
Grandfather didn't have a funeral?

996
00:56:58,506 --> 00:57:01,066
They vowed never to attend
one another's funeral.

997
00:57:01,226 --> 00:57:02,420
Oh, yeah.

998
00:57:02,586 --> 00:57:05,384
I kind of like the idea
of you attending mine.

999
00:57:05,746 --> 00:57:06,781
Heh. What?
No, I know.

1000
00:57:06,986 --> 00:57:09,580
What? I... You know,
imagining you in a suit,

1001
00:57:09,826 --> 00:57:13,262
clean-shaven for once,
holding hands with the girls. I like it.

1002
00:57:13,466 --> 00:57:14,785
You're gonna outlive me.

1003
00:57:14,986 --> 00:57:17,898
Well, we'll see.
Or I guess, one of us will see.

1004
00:57:18,066 --> 00:57:21,661
Heh. Well, you think you wanna go
to the service with me?

1005
00:57:21,866 --> 00:57:25,063
To Texas?
Uh, it's not gonna be in Paris.

1006
00:57:25,306 --> 00:57:27,297
Okay. How bad
do you want me there?

1007
00:57:27,506 --> 00:57:29,974
I'd come, but it's expensive
with the flights.

1008
00:57:31,386 --> 00:57:32,614
Truth is, it'd be simpler to go alone.

1009
00:57:32,826 --> 00:57:34,498
Oh, hello.
Yeah, hello, buddy.

1010
00:57:34,706 --> 00:57:38,221
And if I'm not there, it'll be easier
for you to fuck your cousins.

1011
00:57:38,426 --> 00:57:39,654
Yes, that's true. Ha, ha.
Yeah.

1012
00:57:39,906 --> 00:57:42,181
Isn't that common
where you come from?

1013
00:57:42,386 --> 00:57:44,900
You didn't answer the question.
What question?

1014
00:57:45,106 --> 00:57:48,985
Well, will you be able to put up with me
for another 56 more years?

1015
00:57:49,186 --> 00:57:50,700
I am looking forward to it.

1016
00:57:50,907 --> 00:57:52,898
Shit, you're really working it.
Mm-hm.

1017
00:57:53,067 --> 00:57:57,424
The nectar of your sex
ages like a fine wine.

1018
00:57:57,627 --> 00:57:59,822
Uh-oh.
My hairy Spanish lover is back.

1019
00:58:00,027 --> 00:58:02,461
Greek. I'm Greek now.
Oh, you're Greek now.

1020
00:58:02,667 --> 00:58:04,464
Look at this.

1021
00:58:04,947 --> 00:58:08,906
Wow. This place reminds me of a
movie I saw when I was a teenager.

1022
00:58:09,107 --> 00:58:11,701
It was a black-and-white film
from the '50s.

1023
00:58:11,867 --> 00:58:14,939
I remember a couple walking
through the ruins of Pompeii

1024
00:58:15,147 --> 00:58:17,741
looking at bodies
lying there for centuries.

1025
00:58:17,947 --> 00:58:20,415
I remember the bodies,
caught in their sleep,

1026
00:58:20,627 --> 00:58:23,141
still lovingly holding each other.

1027
00:58:23,547 --> 00:58:26,778
I don't know why. Sometimes
I have this image in my mind

1028
00:58:26,987 --> 00:58:29,455
when, you know, we're asleep
and you hold me.

1029
00:58:29,667 --> 00:58:33,455
Of being buried alive under molten ash?
That's what you're thinking about?

1030
00:58:33,667 --> 00:58:35,419
Ha-ha-ha.
That's not very fun.

1031
00:58:35,627 --> 00:58:38,221
Well, I don't know.
It's not horrible.

1032
00:58:38,387 --> 00:58:41,459
They had bodies with little kids
sleeping between them.

1033
00:58:41,667 --> 00:58:42,861
Oh, that's nice.
Yeah.

1034
00:58:43,067 --> 00:58:44,705
I was young and a bit morbid.

1035
00:58:44,867 --> 00:58:47,939
You romanticize the idea of dying
with the person you love.

1036
00:58:48,107 --> 00:58:49,699
You wanna die with me?
Right?

1037
00:58:49,907 --> 00:58:52,216
Maybe. You know, if we were...

1038
00:58:52,427 --> 00:58:55,942
You know, our first night together then,
a long time ago,

1039
00:58:56,147 --> 00:58:57,865
but now, no, I'd like to live.

1040
00:58:58,067 --> 00:59:00,740
I wanted you to say something
romantic. You blew it.

1041
00:59:00,907 --> 00:59:01,976
Oh, no.

1042
00:59:03,347 --> 00:59:06,305
I blew it. Okay, if we're both 98,
you can ask me again.

1043
00:59:06,507 --> 00:59:07,940
But anytime sooner...

1044
00:59:10,427 --> 00:59:11,860
Sorry.
Hey.

1045
00:59:12,027 --> 00:59:15,464
This is the chapel I was telling you
about from the Byzantine era.

1046
00:59:15,668 --> 00:59:17,465
It's 1000 years old.
Can we go in?

1047
00:59:17,668 --> 00:59:19,863
Yeah, I think so.
Okay.

1048
00:59:20,068 --> 00:59:21,945
Check this out.

1049
00:59:22,148 --> 00:59:24,582
Hello? Yeah.
Wow.

1050
00:59:25,548 --> 00:59:29,860
It's a shrine to Saint Odilia,
the patron saint to eyesight.

1051
00:59:30,028 --> 00:59:33,304
People come from all over,
leave dedications to the blind

1052
00:59:33,468 --> 00:59:35,777
to help restore sight.
Hm.

1053
00:59:35,988 --> 00:59:37,387
I'm sure it works.

1054
00:59:37,548 --> 00:59:39,300
Hey, these paintings here,

1055
00:59:39,508 --> 00:59:43,945
they make me think of those Japanese
monks, you know, impermanence.

1056
00:59:44,148 --> 00:59:46,343
They paint with water
on rock on a hot day.

1057
00:59:46,508 --> 00:59:48,942
By the time they're done,
it's evaporated.

1058
00:59:49,468 --> 00:59:52,187
Eyes are scratched out.
Is that about the blindness?

1059
00:59:52,388 --> 00:59:54,982
No, I thought that too,
but the caretaker guy,

1060
00:59:55,188 --> 00:59:58,498
he told me that the Turks did that
during the occupation.

1061
00:59:59,508 --> 01:00:02,306
That's it.
I'm never eating Turkish food again.

1062
01:00:02,508 --> 01:00:06,706
Heh, heh. Okay, that'll send a shiver
through the international community.

1063
01:00:06,908 --> 01:00:09,183
Okay, fine. Then I'll never suck
another Turkish cock.

1064
01:00:09,388 --> 01:00:12,903
Heh. Okay, that's
gonna have a global impact.

1065
01:00:13,108 --> 01:00:14,541
Oh, that's terrible.

1066
01:00:14,748 --> 01:00:18,946
I forgot you're a closet Christian. Is it
bad to make blow-job jokes in church?

1067
01:00:19,148 --> 01:00:22,697
Shh. It kind of is, okay?
We've done worse.

1068
01:00:30,068 --> 01:00:32,707
The girls asked me again
what our wedding was like.

1069
01:00:32,948 --> 01:00:34,301
Yeah? What did you say?

1070
01:00:34,508 --> 01:00:37,307
I say it was, uh, very low key.
Yeah.

1071
01:00:37,509 --> 01:00:39,898
Very low key.
So low key we don't remember it.

1072
01:00:40,109 --> 01:00:41,462
Very Quaker.
Mm-hm.

1073
01:00:41,709 --> 01:00:45,827
I don't know why they want us to be
married so badly. It's important to them.

1074
01:00:46,029 --> 01:00:48,987
We're in a church. Wanna get married?
No.

1075
01:00:49,229 --> 01:00:52,778
It's just all those fairy tales
they like so much, you know?

1076
01:00:52,949 --> 01:00:55,258
Heh, heh.
Remember when they were little

1077
01:00:55,469 --> 01:01:00,463
and at the end of every cartoon,
they'd be like, "They're getting married,"

1078
01:01:00,669 --> 01:01:04,457
even if it was Pinocchio and his dad,
Donald Duck and his nephews.

1079
01:01:10,149 --> 01:01:12,504
If we're gonna spend
56 more years together,

1080
01:01:12,709 --> 01:01:14,586
Yeah?
what about me would you change?

1081
01:01:16,269 --> 01:01:18,305
What?
One of your can't-win questions.

1082
01:01:18,469 --> 01:01:20,699
I'm not answering that.
What do you mean?

1083
01:01:20,869 --> 01:01:23,588
There's not one thing
you'd like to change about me?

1084
01:01:23,749 --> 01:01:25,944
I'm perfect? Okay.
Okay, actually...

1085
01:01:26,149 --> 01:01:28,947
One thing. Uh-huh.
If I could change one thing about you,

1086
01:01:29,149 --> 01:01:32,778
it would be for you
to stop trying to change me.

1087
01:01:32,989 --> 01:01:34,786
You're a very skilled manipulator.
Mm-hm.

1088
01:01:34,989 --> 01:01:38,299
Well, I am on to you.
I know how you work.

1089
01:01:38,509 --> 01:01:40,420
You think?
I know everything about you.

1090
01:01:40,629 --> 01:01:43,382
Let's go through here.
I don't think you do.

1091
01:01:43,549 --> 01:01:44,982
Ha-ha-ha.
No? Okay.

1092
01:01:45,189 --> 01:01:47,862
Well, I know you better than I
know anybody else on the planet.

1093
01:01:48,109 --> 01:01:50,577
But maybe that's not saying much.
Right now,

1094
01:01:50,789 --> 01:01:53,508
What?
this is great. I feel close to you.

1095
01:01:53,709 --> 01:01:55,142
Yeah.
But sometimes

1096
01:01:55,349 --> 01:01:58,706
I feel like, uh, you're breathing
helium and I'm breathing oxygen.

1097
01:01:59,270 --> 01:02:00,498
What makes you say that? Huh?

1098
01:02:00,750 --> 01:02:03,344
See? I'm trying to connect
Heh, I'm being myself.

1099
01:02:03,510 --> 01:02:05,546
and you make a joke.
Ha-ha-ha.

1100
01:02:05,710 --> 01:02:08,224
That's exactly what I'm
talking about. Come on.

1101
01:02:08,470 --> 01:02:10,779
If we're ever gonna truly know
one another,

1102
01:02:10,990 --> 01:02:14,266
we'd probably have to get
to know ourselves better first.

1103
01:02:14,990 --> 01:02:16,503
Yeah.

1104
01:02:16,870 --> 01:02:20,579
Do you remember this friend of mine,
George, from New York?

1105
01:02:20,790 --> 01:02:21,905
No.

1106
01:02:22,150 --> 01:02:24,220
Oh, no, that was before.
What was?

1107
01:02:24,430 --> 01:02:26,739
No, no.
Anyway, he was this friend of mine

1108
01:02:26,950 --> 01:02:30,659
that when he found out he had
leukemia and was probably gonna die,

1109
01:02:30,870 --> 01:02:33,782
the first thing that came
to his mind was relief.

1110
01:02:33,990 --> 01:02:35,389
Relief? At what?
Yeah.

1111
01:02:35,590 --> 01:02:39,742
Before he found out he had nine months
to live, he was worried about money.

1112
01:02:39,950 --> 01:02:44,740
And now his thought was, "I have enough
money to live nine months. I've made it."

1113
01:02:44,950 --> 01:02:46,383
Oh, okay.
I mean...

1114
01:02:46,630 --> 01:02:51,465
He was finally able to enjoy everything
about life, even being stuck in traffic.

1115
01:02:51,670 --> 01:02:55,948
He would just enjoy looking at people,
staring at their faces, just little things.

1116
01:02:56,150 --> 01:02:57,868
And then what happened?

1117
01:02:58,070 --> 01:02:59,344
What do you mean?

1118
01:02:59,550 --> 01:03:01,381
Well, like, is he still alive?

1119
01:03:01,590 --> 01:03:04,229
No, he died a long time ago.

1120
01:03:06,230 --> 01:03:09,506
Last night, I had this dream
where I was reading a book.

1121
01:03:09,710 --> 01:03:12,144
Okay. It was a lost classic.
The Rovers.

1122
01:03:12,350 --> 01:03:14,818
The Rovers?
Yeah. Like roving around, wandering.

1123
01:03:15,070 --> 01:03:17,504
All these young people.
Is that a real book?

1124
01:03:17,710 --> 01:03:21,829
No, but it was great. It was fresh, funny,
experimental, had all this energy.

1125
01:03:22,031 --> 01:03:25,307
I love that you read in your dreams.
And they're really good.

1126
01:03:25,511 --> 01:03:27,581
I have, like,
major action-hero dreams.

1127
01:03:27,791 --> 01:03:32,581
Like I'm flying around like a superhero,
breaking through walls.

1128
01:03:33,071 --> 01:03:35,380
And at the end, I have an orgasm.

1129
01:03:37,511 --> 01:03:40,071
Well, I'm gonna try to make
your dreams come true, baby.

1130
01:03:40,271 --> 01:03:41,465
Yee.

1131
01:03:55,071 --> 01:03:56,948
Still there.

1132
01:04:00,071 --> 01:04:01,868
Still there.

1133
01:04:13,591 --> 01:04:15,309
Still there.

1134
01:04:19,591 --> 01:04:21,502
Still there.

1135
01:04:27,871 --> 01:04:29,384
Gone.

1136
01:04:43,551 --> 01:04:45,190
I need your credit card.

1137
01:04:45,392 --> 01:04:46,984
Oh, I think the room is paid for.

1138
01:04:47,192 --> 01:04:49,752
Yeah. Yes, it is,
but the credit card is for...

1139
01:04:51,392 --> 01:04:53,701
For all possible outcomes.
Incidentals.

1140
01:04:53,912 --> 01:04:54,981
Right. Of course.

1141
01:04:55,192 --> 01:04:56,307
Mr. Wallace?
Yeah.

1142
01:04:56,512 --> 01:04:58,707
I am such a fan of these two books.

1143
01:04:58,872 --> 01:05:01,102
My husband gave me your book
on our date

1144
01:05:01,272 --> 01:05:04,821
and when your second book came out,
we read it out loud together.

1145
01:05:05,032 --> 01:05:06,067
Oh, wow.

1146
01:05:06,272 --> 01:05:09,150
Would you please sign them to us?
Of course. Of course.

1147
01:05:10,352 --> 01:05:13,901
I love the artwork on these
Greek editions. It's really nice.

1148
01:05:14,512 --> 01:05:18,221
What are your names?
Make it to Sophia and Pavlos.

1149
01:05:18,432 --> 01:05:20,070
Okay.

1150
01:05:21,912 --> 01:05:23,630
How's the Greek translation?

1151
01:05:23,872 --> 01:05:25,590
Well, it's called:

1152
01:05:28,312 --> 01:05:32,510
But I'm not sure it's the correct word.
You never read them in English.

1153
01:05:32,752 --> 01:05:34,105
Exactly.

1154
01:05:35,592 --> 01:05:36,911
That's great.

1155
01:05:37,112 --> 01:05:38,340
Could you sign them too?

1156
01:05:38,912 --> 01:05:41,665
Me?
Yes, you're the real Madeleine, right?

1157
01:05:42,992 --> 01:05:44,664
Madeleine? Not really.

1158
01:05:44,872 --> 01:05:47,784
I mean, people assume it's me,
but it's not me at all.

1159
01:05:47,992 --> 01:05:49,789
He's got a big imagination.

1160
01:05:50,472 --> 01:05:53,589
Would you be so kind?
It would mean so much to my husband.

1161
01:05:55,312 --> 01:05:58,987
I can't sign a book I didn't write.
It... She'd be happy to.

1162
01:05:59,192 --> 01:06:00,944
Okay.
Great. Thank you.

1163
01:06:01,152 --> 01:06:03,029
I'm happy to.

1164
01:06:04,032 --> 01:06:05,590
Uh...

1165
01:06:07,593 --> 01:06:09,982
Thank you.

1166
01:06:11,273 --> 01:06:13,423
Okay.
Great. Thank you so much.

1167
01:06:17,593 --> 01:06:18,742
Check it out.

1168
01:06:18,953 --> 01:06:20,944
Wow. This is nice.
Yeah.

1169
01:06:21,153 --> 01:06:23,747
Clean, air conditioning.

1170
01:06:23,953 --> 01:06:26,547
I love it. Oh, my God.
Isn't it great?

1171
01:06:27,993 --> 01:06:32,509
Wow. Oh, wow. A bathtub. My God.

1172
01:06:32,713 --> 01:06:34,351
Hey, check this out.

1173
01:06:34,553 --> 01:06:39,308
Stefanos and Ariadni got us
a bottle of wine and a couple's massage.

1174
01:06:39,513 --> 01:06:42,027
We have to get them a present
before we leave.

1175
01:06:42,233 --> 01:06:46,226
We should get something for the kids.
Yeah, I know, for sure.

1176
01:06:46,393 --> 01:06:47,382
Wow.

1177
01:06:52,513 --> 01:06:54,390
Oh, I miss the girls.

1178
01:06:54,553 --> 01:06:55,872
Mm. I don't.

1179
01:06:56,073 --> 01:06:58,428
This is such a nice view.

1180
01:06:58,673 --> 01:07:02,507
The only view
that I am interested in...

1181
01:07:02,673 --> 01:07:06,586
What? What?
is right

1182
01:07:06,913 --> 01:07:08,710
here.

1183
01:07:11,553 --> 01:07:14,465
Yeah. It's this.

1184
01:07:29,794 --> 01:07:31,273
What?

1185
01:07:32,296 --> 01:07:33,570
It's funny,

1186
01:07:33,952 --> 01:07:37,832
I never noticed until today,
but all the red in your beard is gone.

1187
01:07:38,514 --> 01:07:42,348
It used to be one of the things
that made me fall for you. It's crazy.

1188
01:07:44,754 --> 01:07:49,430
It's not gone. It's just white.

1189
01:07:49,634 --> 01:07:53,468
You're not gonna tell me that your love
is dependent on pigment, are you?

1190
01:07:53,674 --> 01:07:56,905
Huh? No?
No, no, but, you know...

1191
01:07:57,994 --> 01:08:00,303
I see the red
in our girls' eye lashes.

1192
01:08:00,514 --> 01:08:04,143
I look at them and it makes me
think of when we met.

1193
01:08:07,874 --> 01:08:10,547
Mm.
Know what I'm looking forward to?

1194
01:08:10,714 --> 01:08:12,909
Yeah? What?
After, uh...

1195
01:08:13,114 --> 01:08:15,582
After? Ha-ha-ha.
You know... Ha-ha.

1196
01:08:16,234 --> 01:08:19,465
What?
Is waking up next to you tomorrow.

1197
01:08:19,714 --> 01:08:22,512
You mean, without Nina and Ella
jumping on our heads?

1198
01:08:22,674 --> 01:08:24,392
Exactly.

1199
01:08:24,834 --> 01:08:27,428
I haven't heard you think
in years now.

1200
01:08:27,634 --> 01:08:29,226
Think?
Yeah.

1201
01:08:29,434 --> 01:08:30,913
Oh.

1202
01:08:31,994 --> 01:08:36,829
I used to wake up to that sound
of your eyes opening and closing.

1203
01:08:37,034 --> 01:08:40,709
That brain of yours
going 2 million miles an hour.

1204
01:08:40,914 --> 01:08:44,827
I miss it, hearing you think.

1205
01:08:45,674 --> 01:08:48,746
When you said you could hear
me think, I thought you could.

1206
01:08:48,994 --> 01:08:52,145
But it's just my eyelids.
How dumb and romantic of me.

1207
01:08:52,355 --> 01:08:54,585
Mm. It was my favorite thing.

1208
01:08:55,755 --> 01:08:59,464
Mm. I miss thinking too.

1209
01:09:00,315 --> 01:09:03,307
No more thinking in the morning,
no more morning sex.

1210
01:09:03,555 --> 01:09:05,591
Tomorrow.

1211
01:09:06,755 --> 01:09:10,543
I'm looking forward to it so much,
I don't think I will sleep.

1212
01:09:13,235 --> 01:09:16,068
I'm looking forward to right now.

1213
01:09:16,395 --> 01:09:17,623
Okay.

1214
01:09:17,835 --> 01:09:22,625
Okay, let's stop talking
so we can fuck,

1215
01:09:22,835 --> 01:09:27,784
sleep, wake up, think,
and fuck again.

1216
01:09:37,355 --> 01:09:39,823
Don't answer it.
Ha, ha. No.

1217
01:09:40,035 --> 01:09:41,263
Oh, shit, who is it? No.

1218
01:09:41,475 --> 01:09:43,431
Who cares?
Okay.

1219
01:09:45,355 --> 01:09:50,110
I said to call in case of emergency only.
I hope the girls are okay.

1220
01:09:50,795 --> 01:09:52,194
Okay.

1221
01:09:52,435 --> 01:09:54,665
Oh, it's Henry. Okay.

1222
01:09:54,875 --> 01:09:56,831
Hey, sweetie, are you okay?

1223
01:09:57,395 --> 01:09:59,113
Are you in London?

1224
01:09:59,515 --> 01:10:00,709
Oh.

1225
01:10:01,355 --> 01:10:02,993
Oh, already? Okay.

1226
01:10:05,595 --> 01:10:08,314
Oh, no, no, we found it.

1227
01:10:08,635 --> 01:10:11,991
We'll mail it tomorrow.
Don't worry. Yeah, yeah.

1228
01:10:13,675 --> 01:10:18,067
Yeah. Oh, they miss you too.
I'll kiss them for you.

1229
01:10:18,236 --> 01:10:19,954
Yeah.

1230
01:10:21,276 --> 01:10:23,107
Okay, I'll tell him.

1231
01:10:23,316 --> 01:10:24,590
Good luck with your mom.

1232
01:10:24,796 --> 01:10:27,264
Yeah. I love you too. Bye.

1233
01:10:27,516 --> 01:10:29,108
Okay.

1234
01:10:29,956 --> 01:10:31,230
Okay.

1235
01:10:31,476 --> 01:10:34,832
He's fine. He says he'll call you
from Chicago when he lands.

1236
01:10:35,036 --> 01:10:37,675
Why can't I talk to him?
Twice you've done that.

1237
01:10:37,876 --> 01:10:39,946
You could have just
handed me the phone.

1238
01:10:40,156 --> 01:10:42,306
He didn't have time.
They were boarding.

1239
01:10:42,516 --> 01:10:43,790
What did he forget?

1240
01:10:43,996 --> 01:10:47,545
His science project.
But we'll mail it tomorrow. It'll be fine.

1241
01:10:47,756 --> 01:10:49,826
Shouldn't have said that
about his mom.

1242
01:10:50,076 --> 01:10:53,148
What? What did I say?
"Good luck with your mom."

1243
01:10:53,356 --> 01:10:55,551
Heh. Come on.
I didn't mean anything by it.

1244
01:10:55,756 --> 01:10:59,874
I know, but it's not good. It reminds him.
And I wish you wouldn't do that.

1245
01:11:00,341 --> 01:11:03,358
That's so American to just
swipe it under the carpet

1246
01:11:03,758 --> 01:11:06,070
- and act as if it didn't happen.
- Why put it into his head?

1247
01:11:06,356 --> 01:11:09,393
What if he doesn't wanna be
thinking about that right now?

1248
01:11:09,636 --> 01:11:12,594
It means nothing.
It means something. It does.

1249
01:11:12,796 --> 01:11:14,434
I made a joke the other day

1250
01:11:14,636 --> 01:11:18,390
that his mom and I should settle it
in one big mud wrestling contest.

1251
01:11:18,596 --> 01:11:21,315
Mud wrestling? You said that?
And he laughed.

1252
01:11:21,516 --> 01:11:24,906
He might have more of a sense of humor
than you do. Come on.

1253
01:11:25,156 --> 01:11:29,468
You say bad things about his mom,
he hears bad things about himself.

1254
01:11:29,676 --> 01:11:34,033
I didn't say anything bad about his mom.
I made a joke. It's on me as it is on her.

1255
01:11:34,236 --> 01:11:38,515
I know, I know. It's just,
why conjure it up at all, you know?

1256
01:11:38,717 --> 01:11:40,230
I think he's old enough now.

1257
01:11:40,437 --> 01:11:43,793
I mean, he knows how bad it is
between his mother and I.

1258
01:11:43,997 --> 01:11:47,353
His mom and me.
And I didn't do anything. It's all from her.

1259
01:11:47,597 --> 01:11:51,067
Okay, she hates me. Yes,
I fucked her husband a long time ago.

1260
01:11:51,277 --> 01:11:53,029
Or should I say he fucked me?

1261
01:11:53,317 --> 01:11:55,273
Heh. Yeah, right.
Okay.

1262
01:11:55,517 --> 01:11:59,305
Making a joke that his mom and I
don't love each other is not the issue.

1263
01:11:59,477 --> 01:12:02,310
That's not gonna traumatize him.
That already happened.

1264
01:12:02,477 --> 01:12:05,469
And now you're trying
to transfer your guilt and blame me.

1265
01:12:05,637 --> 01:12:06,672
No, I'm not.

1266
01:12:06,877 --> 01:12:11,428
On the contrary, if he can joke about it,
maybe he'll be able to live with it better.

1267
01:12:11,637 --> 01:12:16,506
Okay, you're right, as always.
Let's just not talk about it, okay?

1268
01:12:17,037 --> 01:12:21,713
Mm-hm. Right. It's nobody's fault if his mom
is a drunk and abusive psychologically.

1269
01:12:21,957 --> 01:12:23,788
Don't say that.

1270
01:12:23,957 --> 01:12:26,232
It makes me sick
that he has to be with her.

1271
01:12:26,437 --> 01:12:29,270
But judges assume
that women have the mother instinct.

1272
01:12:29,477 --> 01:12:32,196
She has the mother instinct of Medea.

1273
01:12:32,357 --> 01:12:33,790
Medea, huh?

1274
01:12:33,997 --> 01:12:36,113
Yeah. After all, it is a Greek myth.

1275
01:12:36,317 --> 01:12:38,228
Actually a play by Euripides, but...

1276
01:12:38,477 --> 01:12:41,116
A woman killing her kids
to punish her ex-husband.

1277
01:12:41,357 --> 01:12:43,996
That's what she's doing.
Hurting him to get to you.

1278
01:12:44,237 --> 01:12:47,866
No, she's making my life hell
through him, that's what she's doing.

1279
01:12:48,077 --> 01:12:52,548
And sometimes you say things
that just go too far.

1280
01:12:52,757 --> 01:12:55,510
Stop blaming me
for everything wrong with your wife.

1281
01:12:55,717 --> 01:12:59,392
Ex-wife, ex-wife. For a long time.
Okay.

1282
01:12:59,597 --> 01:13:02,476
Should have dealt with it.
She wouldn't have hated us.

1283
01:13:02,678 --> 01:13:04,873
Okay, okay, I screwed up.

1284
01:13:05,438 --> 01:13:07,906
I just love this little re-write
you do

1285
01:13:08,118 --> 01:13:12,794
that everything that isn't perfect
in our life gets laid at my feet.

1286
01:13:13,438 --> 01:13:16,111
And now you're putting this shit
on me about Henry.

1287
01:13:16,318 --> 01:13:18,468
What shit?
What are you talking about?

1288
01:13:18,678 --> 01:13:23,354
Let me tell you what I'm talking about.
The moving to Chicago, giving up my life.

1289
01:13:24,998 --> 01:13:29,230
You mentioned that Henry needs you.
How do you think that makes me feel?

1290
01:13:29,438 --> 01:13:31,349
I'm miserable. All right?

1291
01:13:31,558 --> 01:13:33,594
How can I take that job now?
Okay.

1292
01:13:33,798 --> 01:13:36,710
Tell me. I'll feel too guilty. No, no, no.
Come here.

1293
01:13:36,918 --> 01:13:40,388
That's a choice you're making,
to look at it like that. All right?

1294
01:13:40,598 --> 01:13:43,670
It is in the nature of women
to be the nurturer.

1295
01:13:43,918 --> 01:13:45,795
The what?
The nurturer.

1296
01:13:45,998 --> 01:13:49,070
The nurturer?
Okay, I can't even say that fucking word.

1297
01:13:49,278 --> 01:13:53,988
I just naturally feel bad about everything.
And you give that look, like it's my fault.

1298
01:13:54,198 --> 01:13:57,031
What look?
The I-forgot-the-science-project look.

1299
01:13:57,238 --> 01:13:59,593
I know you blame me.
I didn't say anything.

1300
01:13:59,798 --> 01:14:03,507
No, you didn't say anything.
You didn't have to. It's always my fault.

1301
01:14:03,718 --> 01:14:05,595
Yeah, right.

1302
01:14:05,838 --> 01:14:07,829
I read on the fridge at work...

1303
01:14:08,038 --> 01:14:11,269
You know those magnet words
that people make sentences with?

1304
01:14:11,438 --> 01:14:12,427
Mm-hm.

1305
01:14:12,598 --> 01:14:16,910
Someone had put together,
"Women explore for eternity

1306
01:14:17,158 --> 01:14:19,149
in the vast garden of sacrifice."

1307
01:14:21,318 --> 01:14:24,152
Wow. That's a sure sign from God.
Yeah.

1308
01:14:24,359 --> 01:14:28,511
That line is so damn true, and it's been
for 10,000 years, but that's enough.

1309
01:14:28,759 --> 01:14:30,636
I don't wanna be one of these women.

1310
01:14:30,879 --> 01:14:34,474
Like marriage is important to gays,
or contraception to women rights.

1311
01:14:34,719 --> 01:14:39,110
It's the same with giving up my hopes,
with women that had to give up hopes.

1312
01:14:39,319 --> 01:14:43,232
I'm not gonna do it. This is bigger
than me. This means more than me.

1313
01:14:46,119 --> 01:14:50,078
Wow. Bravo.
The Nobel Committee is taking note.

1314
01:14:50,319 --> 01:14:53,231
I'm just... Hold on a second.
I'm gonna alert Sweden.

1315
01:14:53,439 --> 01:14:56,875
It must be a full-time job carrying
that much feminine oppression.

1316
01:14:57,119 --> 01:14:59,030
It is.
You suffered so much

1317
01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:01,110
growing up in middle-class Paris.

1318
01:15:01,279 --> 01:15:04,954
The agony in the trenches of
the Sorbonne in the post-feminist era.

1319
01:15:05,119 --> 01:15:07,189
I can't imagine.
You're an asshole.

1320
01:15:07,799 --> 01:15:10,871
You know what, sweetie,
when are we moving to Chicago?

1321
01:15:11,079 --> 01:15:13,957
I wanna make sure
we are able to find a nice house

1322
01:15:14,159 --> 01:15:17,549
and I can sew the drapes
and pick matching bed covers.

1323
01:15:17,759 --> 01:15:20,512
This is how you now want
to be spending this evening?

1324
01:15:20,719 --> 01:15:22,994
This is what you wanna do?
You started it.

1325
01:15:23,199 --> 01:15:26,908
No, you are the one
who will not shut up about it.

1326
01:15:27,119 --> 01:15:30,270
But if you wanna talk about it,
really talk about it,

1327
01:15:30,479 --> 01:15:34,552
I would prefer to have an unemotional,
rational conversation.

1328
01:15:34,719 --> 01:15:36,357
Do you think we could do that?

1329
01:15:36,559 --> 01:15:39,392
Here we go, unemotional, rational.

1330
01:15:39,599 --> 01:15:42,591
You always play the part
of the one and only rational one.

1331
01:15:42,759 --> 01:15:46,309
And I'm the irrational, hysterical,
hormone-crazy one

1332
01:15:46,520 --> 01:15:47,953
because I have emotions.

1333
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:50,879
You sit back and speak
from your big perspective,

1334
01:15:51,080 --> 01:15:53,514
which means
everything you say is true.

1335
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:55,239
I don't always do anything.

1336
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:59,149
The world is fucked by unemotional,
rational men deciding shit.

1337
01:15:59,360 --> 01:16:03,797
Politicians going to war, corporate heads
deciding to wreck the environment.

1338
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,878
Cheney, Rumsfeld, very rational men.

1339
01:16:07,080 --> 01:16:08,911
Cheney and Rumsfeld,
yeah, okay.

1340
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:12,192
The Final Solution,
very rational thinking behind that.

1341
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:13,759
Okay. So we're there now?

1342
01:16:13,960 --> 01:16:17,396
Us versus the Final Solution?
Okay. Let's do it. All right.

1343
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:19,431
Let me ask you this, all right?

1344
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:22,433
Do you think Henry's life
would be helped

1345
01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:25,108
by a more consistent presence
by you and me? Huh?

1346
01:16:26,120 --> 01:16:27,394
Here we go.
No.

1347
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:31,479
You won't drop it, so let's talk.
Let me just ask you one question.

1348
01:16:32,040 --> 01:16:34,235
Think Hank's life
would be better served

1349
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:36,550
by consistent presence
from you and me?

1350
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:39,598
Yes, it'd be better if he lived with us.
Okay.

1351
01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:42,633
I think his mom
is a fucking alcoholic, hateful cunt

1352
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:46,355
that used the time we were in Paris
and I was giving birth

1353
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:50,070
to legally move Henry out of
New York. Fuck her.

1354
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:52,995
Okay. I agree with you.
Mm-hm.

1355
01:16:53,160 --> 01:16:56,072
Okay. Unfortunately,
we cannot go get him out of America,

1356
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:58,914
but we could, if we wanted to,
go to him.

1357
01:16:59,160 --> 01:17:01,594
Now, I know it would be
a big move.

1358
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:05,793
But what do you think? Is there any way
that you could be happy in the U.S.?

1359
01:17:06,040 --> 01:17:08,594
Is that just out of
the realm of possibility?

1360
01:17:08,935 --> 01:17:11,247
That you could find
a comparable job?

1361
01:17:11,282 --> 01:17:12,120
Comparable job?
Yeah.

1362
01:17:12,281 --> 01:17:13,680
Are you kidding?
No.

1363
01:17:13,881 --> 01:17:16,793
Why am I the one that have
to make the compromises?

1364
01:17:17,001 --> 01:17:19,356
Don't be so dramatic. Okay?
It should be...

1365
01:17:19,561 --> 01:17:22,280
Moving to Chicago
is pretty fucking dramatic for me.

1366
01:17:22,481 --> 01:17:26,679
I'm not saying we should move.
I just wanna talk about it.

1367
01:17:26,881 --> 01:17:29,600
Can you be my friend
for two seconds so we can talk?

1368
01:17:29,801 --> 01:17:31,029
Two seconds.
All right.

1369
01:17:31,201 --> 01:17:34,193
Remember that time you were late
to pick the girls up

1370
01:17:34,401 --> 01:17:39,191
and you were so stressed out because
they were wondering what happened?

1371
01:17:39,401 --> 01:17:42,234
Okay, that is the way
that I feel all the time.

1372
01:17:42,441 --> 01:17:46,514
Like I fucked up. I mean, I left him behind
and I just wanna go get him.

1373
01:17:46,681 --> 01:17:49,354
You always get like this
when you drop him off.

1374
01:17:49,561 --> 01:17:51,517
You're sad, so you start a fight.

1375
01:17:52,081 --> 01:17:53,719
He's fine.

1376
01:17:53,961 --> 01:17:56,839
He's a great kid, okay?

1377
01:17:57,041 --> 01:17:59,601
Truth is, he doesn't need you
the way he used to.

1378
01:17:59,801 --> 01:18:04,192
You missed the opportunity to be with
him every day of his childhood. You did.

1379
01:18:04,401 --> 01:18:08,030
And you can cry about it,
but he's growing up.

1380
01:18:08,361 --> 01:18:12,434
You're a great father in other ways.
You got divorced

1381
01:18:12,601 --> 01:18:16,514
like millions of other people.
Was it ideal? No. But...

1382
01:18:17,041 --> 01:18:20,750
Listen, if in one month
you still want me to quit my job

1383
01:18:20,961 --> 01:18:24,431
and give up everything I've been
working towards, just ask,

1384
01:18:24,601 --> 01:18:28,196
but right now
I feel the same way I always have.

1385
01:18:28,401 --> 01:18:32,600
I would move to the U.S. if that ex-wife
of yours would give us joint custody.

1386
01:18:32,802 --> 01:18:35,475
But every other weekend
amounts to shit.

1387
01:18:35,642 --> 01:18:37,314
That's less than
30 days a semester.

1388
01:18:37,482 --> 01:18:42,192
I don't think it's worth it for us to change
our entire lives over that kind of time.

1389
01:18:42,402 --> 01:18:44,472
I know. You're right. Mm-hm.
Right? Right?

1390
01:18:44,722 --> 01:18:47,111
See, I'm being the rational one.

1391
01:18:48,762 --> 01:18:51,230
Oh, it's just such a shitty position,
you know?

1392
01:18:51,482 --> 01:18:55,157
Hank didn't do anything, but he's
the one getting kicked in the teeth.

1393
01:18:55,402 --> 01:18:57,791
We all get dragged
through our parents' lives.

1394
01:18:58,002 --> 01:19:00,994
Your marriage would have ended
over something else.

1395
01:19:01,242 --> 01:19:03,802
Absolutely.
Or worse, he would've been raised

1396
01:19:03,962 --> 01:19:05,759
by two miserable parents.
Right.

1397
01:19:08,202 --> 01:19:10,557
I just really fucked that up.

1398
01:19:13,002 --> 01:19:16,312
You mean, you fucked up by moving
to Paris to be with me?

1399
01:19:16,482 --> 01:19:20,600
No. That's not what I meant. Stop.
I knew that was gonna cost too much.

1400
01:19:20,842 --> 01:19:23,117
I told you not to do it, okay?
Stop it.

1401
01:19:23,682 --> 01:19:28,836
Okay, I moved to New York with you
for two years and gave up everything.

1402
01:19:29,042 --> 01:19:31,715
I needed to be home
to give birth to the twins

1403
01:19:31,922 --> 01:19:34,880
and I wanted to be with my mother.
You wanted it too.

1404
01:19:35,042 --> 01:19:37,510
Yes.
That's the one thing I asked from you.

1405
01:19:37,722 --> 01:19:40,680
The one thing, and now you're gonna
blame me forever?

1406
01:19:41,322 --> 01:19:44,997
Stop it, will you? Stop it.

1407
01:19:45,242 --> 01:19:50,555
If you don't wanna move back
to the States, we won't. End of story.

1408
01:19:50,762 --> 01:19:52,718
I am just trying to find a way

1409
01:19:52,882 --> 01:19:55,795
where I could be a more consistent
presence in his life.

1410
01:19:56,003 --> 01:19:58,756
And ideally, I'd like to do that
as a family.

1411
01:19:59,603 --> 01:20:01,833
"As a family"? Or what?

1412
01:20:02,003 --> 01:20:03,834
What the fuck does that mean?

1413
01:20:05,163 --> 01:20:09,236
I feel a passive-aggressive threat
in everything you say.

1414
01:20:09,443 --> 01:20:14,153
Either do this or I will resent you
for the rest of our lives.

1415
01:20:14,363 --> 01:20:15,921
You know?

1416
01:20:16,403 --> 01:20:18,155
Am I right?

1417
01:20:19,683 --> 01:20:22,993
You know what? You know what?
I'm sensing something.

1418
01:20:23,243 --> 01:20:27,759
I think the problem is, is that you don't
want me to have a more substantial job.

1419
01:20:27,963 --> 01:20:31,353
On some level, you feel threatened
by my achieving anything

1420
01:20:31,563 --> 01:20:34,396
that could diminish your status
in our relationship.

1421
01:20:34,603 --> 01:20:36,958
My status
in our relationship?

1422
01:20:37,163 --> 01:20:41,156
I teach two courses a semester
at the fucking American School.

1423
01:20:41,363 --> 01:20:44,116
Okay. Wow, that's really some status.

1424
01:20:44,323 --> 01:20:46,791
I don't think it's coincidence
you feel that

1425
01:20:47,003 --> 01:20:50,120
at the same time
I have a truly exciting job opportunity.

1426
01:20:50,283 --> 01:20:54,435
This whole train of thought
is complete horseshit and you know it.

1427
01:20:55,003 --> 01:20:57,198
I have a question for you.

1428
01:20:57,443 --> 01:21:00,710
If we didn't have the
girls and all our crap,

1429
01:21:01,104 --> 01:21:03,670
- would we even still be together?
- What?

1430
01:21:04,603 --> 01:21:07,720
You are the fucking mayor
of crazy town, do you know that?

1431
01:21:07,923 --> 01:21:11,552
You know what I think? You need
to move to Chicago. Henry needs you.

1432
01:21:11,763 --> 01:21:14,323
I stay in Paris with the girls
and take this job.

1433
01:21:14,523 --> 01:21:15,876
Why are you doing this?
Huh?

1434
01:21:16,123 --> 01:21:17,762
That is a ridiculous idea.

1435
01:21:18,004 --> 01:21:22,236
I'm gonna lose you and the girls?
No. Why do you make everything so difficult?

1436
01:21:22,444 --> 01:21:25,993
You're unhappy. You're blaming me
for taking you away from your son.

1437
01:21:26,204 --> 01:21:28,843
That is a completely irrational
response

1438
01:21:29,044 --> 01:21:32,161
to something I'm just trying
to feel my way through.

1439
01:21:32,444 --> 01:21:37,359
Listen, Jesse, we've just
spent the last six weeks here,

1440
01:21:38,164 --> 01:21:40,280
and it's been great.

1441
01:21:40,804 --> 01:21:45,434
You've been able to write every day
and the weather's been nice.

1442
01:21:45,964 --> 01:21:48,603
But I didn't wanna come to Greece.
I know.

1443
01:21:48,804 --> 01:21:51,523
All right? There could be
a revolution any second.

1444
01:21:51,724 --> 01:21:54,841
Oh, God.
People eat a lot of feta and olive oil

1445
01:21:55,044 --> 01:21:59,117
and they act all happy, but they
actually talk about how angry they are

1446
01:21:59,324 --> 01:22:02,077
and it confuses me.
I don't know what's gonna happen.

1447
01:22:02,244 --> 01:22:04,394
Oh-oh-oh. Let me
tell you what's gonna happen.

1448
01:22:04,604 --> 01:22:07,676
The same thing
that always happens.

1449
01:22:07,924 --> 01:22:09,915
Nothing.

1450
01:22:10,244 --> 01:22:13,634
All right. Know what? I have had
absolutely zero time for myself.

1451
01:22:13,804 --> 01:22:17,001
I have 10,000 e-mails I have to
answer that I didn't answer.

1452
01:22:17,204 --> 01:22:18,319
You think I don't?

1453
01:22:18,564 --> 01:22:22,000
I spend all day making dinner
and wiping you and your son's pee

1454
01:22:22,204 --> 01:22:24,195
while you talk to fellow novelists.

1455
01:22:24,444 --> 01:22:30,041
Blah, blah, blah, you're a genius.
Oh, blah, blah, blah, no, you're a genius.

1456
01:22:30,244 --> 01:22:32,155
Mm-hm.
The second we say goodbye to Henry,

1457
01:22:32,324 --> 01:22:35,236
you suggest I give up
my dream job.

1458
01:22:35,444 --> 01:22:37,241
Oh, okay, now it's your dream job?

1459
01:22:37,444 --> 01:22:40,437
This afternoon
you weren't even sure you wanted it.

1460
01:22:40,645 --> 01:22:42,442
Do you ever listen to yourself?

1461
01:22:42,605 --> 01:22:46,996
It is my dream job. Just because I have
doubts doesn't mean I don't want it.

1462
01:22:47,205 --> 01:22:48,604
Okay.
But why do you care?

1463
01:22:48,845 --> 01:22:52,394
You go on your two-hour contemplative
walk under the olive trees.

1464
01:22:52,605 --> 01:22:54,880
Socrates. You should get a robe.

1465
01:22:55,045 --> 01:22:56,683
Uh-huh. It's an hour.

1466
01:22:56,885 --> 01:23:00,400
By the time you leave and by the
time you're with us, two hours.

1467
01:23:00,645 --> 01:23:01,794
I could never do that.

1468
01:23:02,005 --> 01:23:06,283
You're good at taking care of yourself.
I take care of myself and everything else.

1469
01:23:06,525 --> 01:23:09,278
We go, you pack your bag.
I pack everything else.

1470
01:23:09,445 --> 01:23:12,835
You would never let me pack
the girls' shit. Never.

1471
01:23:13,045 --> 01:23:15,400
There would be no shoes
and dirty underwear.

1472
01:23:15,565 --> 01:23:16,918
Yeah, right, so says you.

1473
01:23:17,165 --> 01:23:20,840
No, I'm happy you have time
to contemplate the universe

1474
01:23:21,085 --> 01:23:23,599
because I don't.
I barely have time to think.

1475
01:23:23,805 --> 01:23:25,875
I work, I babysit,
I work, I babysit.

1476
01:23:26,085 --> 01:23:29,919
Could you hold on a second?
I just have to tune up the string section.

1477
01:23:30,165 --> 01:23:34,761
You know what? Only time I get to think
now is when I take a shit at the office.

1478
01:23:34,965 --> 01:23:37,638
I'm starting to associate thoughts
with the smell of shit.

1479
01:23:37,805 --> 01:23:42,117
Ha, ha. Well, that is a good line.
I'm gonna use that in a book someday.

1480
01:23:42,325 --> 01:23:45,283
Yeah, I'm sure and that'll be
the best line in the book.

1481
01:23:45,485 --> 01:23:47,043
And by the way,
you may never,

1482
01:23:47,205 --> 01:23:49,673
ever use me
or anything I say or do

1483
01:23:49,885 --> 01:23:53,480
in one of your fucking books again.
That goes for the girls too.

1484
01:23:53,685 --> 01:23:56,358
A, you shouldn't have
hooked up with a writer.

1485
01:23:56,565 --> 01:23:58,999
B, you weren't in the last book
or the one now.

1486
01:23:59,245 --> 01:24:01,805
C, I"m gonna write about
whatever the fuck I want.

1487
01:24:02,045 --> 01:24:03,798
As always,
our life works for you.

1488
01:24:04,046 --> 01:24:07,402
No, no, no. Don't give me this put-upon
housewife bullshit. Okay?

1489
01:24:07,606 --> 01:24:08,721
This is not the '50s.

1490
01:24:08,966 --> 01:24:12,879
Sorry to ruin your perfect little narrative
of oppression with the truth,

1491
01:24:13,086 --> 01:24:16,283
but I am the one who's at home
dealing with the bullshit.

1492
01:24:16,446 --> 01:24:18,596
You're at work until 6:30.
Six o'clock.

1493
01:24:18,806 --> 01:24:22,765
You take the girls to school, I pick
them up. That's fair. That's our deal.

1494
01:24:22,966 --> 01:24:28,836
We live in Paris, France, for chrissakes.
And you remind me of it every day.

1495
01:24:29,046 --> 01:24:32,755
I have orbited my entire life around
you and you know it. Okay?

1496
01:24:32,966 --> 01:24:36,003
Sorry if this summer's vacation...
And it is a vacation.

1497
01:24:36,246 --> 01:24:39,841
I've seen you frolic in the sea
and shove salad down your throat.

1498
01:24:40,086 --> 01:24:44,204
But it is not indicative of you spending
your life in domestic servitude.

1499
01:24:44,406 --> 01:24:47,796
You know what I love about men?
They still believe in magic.

1500
01:24:48,046 --> 01:24:50,480
Little fairies around
who pick up their socks,

1501
01:24:50,686 --> 01:24:54,838
little fairies unload the dishwasher,
little fairies sunscreen the kids.

1502
01:24:55,046 --> 01:24:58,436
Little fairies who make the Greek
salad that you eat like a pig.

1503
01:24:58,686 --> 01:25:00,244
Okay, listen to me. All right?

1504
01:25:00,446 --> 01:25:03,358
You are great at taking care of us.
You are.

1505
01:25:03,606 --> 01:25:07,155
I mean, you take care of the kids,
you take care of your friends,

1506
01:25:07,366 --> 01:25:11,279
you take care of the world.
You were like that before you were a mom

1507
01:25:11,526 --> 01:25:13,164
and now it's only magnified.

1508
01:25:13,406 --> 01:25:16,364
But, and I've been telling you this
for years now,

1509
01:25:16,566 --> 01:25:19,763
you gotta do a little better job
taking care of yourself.

1510
01:25:19,966 --> 01:25:22,400
Okay, stop patronizing me.
All right?

1511
01:25:22,606 --> 01:25:26,361
I'm the one at home every day at 6,
not 6:30. I'm reliable.

1512
01:25:26,567 --> 01:25:30,879
Have you ever booked a babysitter,
ever, in your entire life? No.

1513
01:25:31,087 --> 01:25:35,239
What is the name of their pediatrician?
Stop quizzing me. It's fucking boring.

1514
01:25:35,407 --> 01:25:39,366
Yeah, okay. You know what? I'm at home
every night and I make dinner,

1515
01:25:39,567 --> 01:25:42,639
give baths and read stories.
Sometimes you're there,

1516
01:25:42,847 --> 01:25:46,920
sometimes you're at a university event
or a publicity tour. Okay?

1517
01:25:47,127 --> 01:25:50,278
When you get inspired,
you keep on writing.

1518
01:25:50,527 --> 01:25:53,325
I get inspired too sometimes,
you know that?

1519
01:25:53,487 --> 01:25:56,320
You wanna write? Write.
No, but you remember

1520
01:25:56,527 --> 01:25:59,087
I used to sing and play guitar
and write songs?

1521
01:25:59,327 --> 01:26:02,683
I'd still like to do it,
but I don't get to. There isn't time.

1522
01:26:02,887 --> 01:26:06,800
Okay. Well, first off,
my writing isn't a hobby. All right?

1523
01:26:07,047 --> 01:26:09,402
Secondly,
I wish you would find the time.

1524
01:26:09,607 --> 01:26:12,724
You somehow find time to complain
about eight hours a day.

1525
01:26:12,967 --> 01:26:17,245
I mean,
I love the way you sing. Okay?

1526
01:26:17,807 --> 01:26:22,198
I fucked up my whole life
because of the way you sing. All right?

1527
01:26:22,407 --> 01:26:26,286
If you took one-eighth
of the energy that you spend

1528
01:26:26,487 --> 01:26:28,955
on bitching,
whining and worrying...

1529
01:26:29,167 --> 01:26:33,843
If you put that energy into playing scales,
you'd be like fucking Django Reinhardt.

1530
01:26:39,647 --> 01:26:42,207
Okay. All right.

1531
01:26:42,407 --> 01:26:44,602
You forgot your shoes.

1532
01:26:49,728 --> 01:26:51,446
Oh, God.

1533
01:26:51,768 --> 01:26:53,087
Hey.

1534
01:27:04,768 --> 01:27:06,121
You think you're winning?

1535
01:27:07,088 --> 01:27:08,203
Few people realize

1536
01:27:08,408 --> 01:27:12,526
what it's like for an active or
passionate woman to have a child.

1537
01:27:12,688 --> 01:27:15,725
Friends told me, "You'll wanna
throw them out the window."

1538
01:27:15,928 --> 01:27:20,638
But I never wanted to hurt them once,
but I thought about ending it for myself.

1539
01:27:21,368 --> 01:27:24,838
I was so confused and you were
always away on a stupid book tour

1540
01:27:25,008 --> 01:27:28,683
or because of Henry's custody shit,
and I didn't wanna be a burden.

1541
01:27:28,848 --> 01:27:31,442
I know why Sylvia Plath
put her head in a toaster.

1542
01:27:31,648 --> 01:27:34,082
It was an oven.
Don't play with words.

1543
01:27:34,288 --> 01:27:37,166
You know what I mean.
Toaster, oven, same thing.

1544
01:27:37,368 --> 01:27:40,917
You know how many times I was
alone crying with no clue what to do?

1545
01:27:41,088 --> 01:27:44,364
Know the guilt a mother feels
when she doesn't know what to do?

1546
01:27:44,528 --> 01:27:47,725
Do you think you have
sole ownership of that feeling?

1547
01:27:47,888 --> 01:27:50,322
I don't think you understand.
Okay?

1548
01:27:50,568 --> 01:27:53,560
You know what my secret fear is?
With every man?

1549
01:27:53,768 --> 01:27:57,761
Is that they all wanna turn me
into a submissive housewife.

1550
01:27:57,928 --> 01:28:01,125
Okay. No one could ever do that.
All right?

1551
01:28:01,688 --> 01:28:05,966
I promise. It would be easier
to fit your head into a toaster

1552
01:28:06,208 --> 01:28:08,881
than to turn you
into anything submissive.

1553
01:28:09,128 --> 01:28:12,087
I don't think I've recovered
since giving birth.

1554
01:28:12,289 --> 01:28:15,008
When they were born,
I had no idea what to do.

1555
01:28:15,209 --> 01:28:19,088
People expect women
to have this instinct that kicks in

1556
01:28:19,289 --> 01:28:21,007
like a female baboon.

1557
01:28:21,209 --> 01:28:24,201
But I had no idea how to do anything.

1558
01:28:24,489 --> 01:28:28,118
I loved them so much
and I was doing everything wrong.

1559
01:28:28,329 --> 01:28:32,925
And you were away so often,
calling me and asking me how my day went,

1560
01:28:33,129 --> 01:28:36,838
and I couldn't even say it to you
because I felt so ashamed

1561
01:28:37,049 --> 01:28:38,164
to be so clueless.

1562
01:28:38,409 --> 01:28:40,365
I think you did great.
No, I didn't.

1563
01:28:40,569 --> 01:28:44,005
No, you did. Well, you did
a good job faking it, then.

1564
01:28:44,689 --> 01:28:47,886
I just... I remember the only way
I could get them to sleep

1565
01:28:48,089 --> 01:28:51,638
was to drag that stupid
double stroller down the stairs

1566
01:28:51,849 --> 01:28:54,488
and walk them for hours
in the middle of the night,

1567
01:28:54,689 --> 01:28:58,238
all the way to Pigalle and back.
I almost got mugged once.

1568
01:28:58,449 --> 01:29:02,840
The only reason why the guy didn't
attack me is that I looked so pathetic.

1569
01:29:03,049 --> 01:29:06,644
The only upside of being over 35 is
that you don't get raped as much.

1570
01:29:06,849 --> 01:29:10,159
Ha-ha-ha.
I read it. It's true.

1571
01:29:10,369 --> 01:29:12,758
Oh, Jesus.

1572
01:29:14,129 --> 01:29:18,884
Once, I remember, I was watching the
twins on a trampoline, you know,

1573
01:29:19,089 --> 01:29:21,000
and they looked so beautiful,

1574
01:29:21,209 --> 01:29:23,564
and I was happy
because they were happy.

1575
01:29:23,769 --> 01:29:26,920
You know,
one of them had this Hula-Hoop

1576
01:29:27,129 --> 01:29:29,927
that she was using as a jump rope,
you know,

1577
01:29:30,169 --> 01:29:34,368
but then the other one wanted it so
they started fighting over it, you know?

1578
01:29:34,570 --> 01:29:36,606
And all of a sudden,
I just saw it all.

1579
01:29:36,810 --> 01:29:41,088
You know, all this petty jealously
and selfishness, you know?

1580
01:29:41,290 --> 01:29:42,965
And I remember thinking,

1581
01:29:43,417 --> 01:29:48,236
"Okay, this, heh,
is the natural human state."

1582
01:29:48,271 --> 01:29:53,568
You know, just always a little dissatisfied,
perpetually discontented, you know?

1583
01:29:53,770 --> 01:29:56,603
I mean, heh, look at us.

1584
01:29:56,810 --> 01:30:00,928
Here we are, we are in, you know,
the Garden of Eden

1585
01:30:01,130 --> 01:30:03,644
and we can't stop fighting.

1586
01:30:04,210 --> 01:30:06,724
I don't think there's
one natural human state.

1587
01:30:06,930 --> 01:30:08,443
The human state is multiple.

1588
01:30:08,650 --> 01:30:11,926
If that's what you see when
you're watching the girls play,

1589
01:30:12,170 --> 01:30:14,320
that means you're depressed.

1590
01:30:15,370 --> 01:30:17,565
Okay. Maybe I am.

1591
01:30:17,770 --> 01:30:21,888
No, but when I see them fight,
I see beautiful energy of going forward,

1592
01:30:22,050 --> 01:30:25,360
not letting anyone step on them
or take away what they want.

1593
01:30:25,570 --> 01:30:28,448
I like it when they fight.
It gives me hope for them.

1594
01:30:28,650 --> 01:30:30,800
You see anger
as a positive emotion.

1595
01:30:31,010 --> 01:30:35,686
You know, you only end up hurting yourself,
your work, the kids, me.

1596
01:30:37,730 --> 01:30:39,163
And you never get angry?

1597
01:30:39,370 --> 01:30:42,328
When I do,
I don't see it as a positive.

1598
01:30:44,450 --> 01:30:46,327
You know something?

1599
01:30:48,530 --> 01:30:51,249
The way you write, people
come up to me and think

1600
01:30:51,450 --> 01:30:55,966
I make love to some wildcat
Henry Miller type. Ha!

1601
01:30:57,051 --> 01:31:01,408
You like to have sex
the exact same way every time.

1602
01:31:01,571 --> 01:31:03,402
Mm. When you got it, you got it.

1603
01:31:03,611 --> 01:31:06,489
Kissy, kissy. Tittie, tittie.
Pussy.

1604
01:31:07,891 --> 01:31:10,200
I'm a man of simple pleasures.

1605
01:31:10,411 --> 01:31:13,005
Yeah, very simple,

1606
01:31:13,211 --> 01:31:15,771
and I've been meaning
to tell you that lately. Tsk.

1607
01:31:15,971 --> 01:31:20,010
You're no Henry Miller,
on any level.

1608
01:31:21,731 --> 01:31:24,689
And you know what? Heh.
This room gives me the creeps.

1609
01:31:24,891 --> 01:31:28,088
I was expecting something quaint,
like the real Greece.

1610
01:31:28,331 --> 01:31:30,401
Place is real.
What are we doing here?

1611
01:31:30,611 --> 01:31:34,240
This is too planned, like we're supposed to
have this great evening.

1612
01:31:34,451 --> 01:31:37,443
No room for spontaneity.
It is all gone from our lives.

1613
01:31:37,651 --> 01:31:40,449
This is stupid and it's not working.
Obviously.

1614
01:31:40,651 --> 01:31:44,007
And I curse Ariadni and that perv
Stefanos for doing this.

1615
01:31:44,211 --> 01:31:45,690
Okay. A couple's massage?

1616
01:31:45,931 --> 01:31:48,399
What the fuck is that?
That sounds sleazy to me.

1617
01:31:48,611 --> 01:31:51,330
We don't have to do it!
Okay?

1618
01:31:51,531 --> 01:31:53,761
Come on,
this place isn't so bad.

1619
01:31:53,971 --> 01:31:55,689
I like hotel rooms.

1620
01:31:55,891 --> 01:31:57,483
I think they're sexy.

1621
01:31:57,731 --> 01:31:59,801
Yeah, I know you do...

1622
01:32:00,971 --> 01:32:03,041
Mr. Book-Tour.

1623
01:32:04,731 --> 01:32:07,370
Mr. Radisson-Hilton.

1624
01:32:08,651 --> 01:32:12,564
And I know that time when you were
doing that reading in Washington,

1625
01:32:12,771 --> 01:32:17,242
when your cell phone supposedly
broke that night. How convenient.

1626
01:32:18,211 --> 01:32:21,887
Swear on our kids you didn't fuck
that lady from the bookstore. Emily.

1627
01:32:22,532 --> 01:32:25,330
Swear to me
you didn't fuck that Emily girl.

1628
01:32:25,532 --> 01:32:27,887
And I'm not jealous
because I"m not the type.

1629
01:32:28,092 --> 01:32:31,243
But I just wanna know. Okay?
Be a man and admit the truth.

1630
01:32:33,012 --> 01:32:36,243
I am giving you my whole life,
okay?

1631
01:32:36,452 --> 01:32:39,012
I got nothing larger to give.

1632
01:32:39,212 --> 01:32:41,123
I'm not giving it to anybody else.

1633
01:32:42,652 --> 01:32:46,008
If you're looking for permission
to disqualify me,

1634
01:32:46,212 --> 01:32:48,043
I'm not gonna give it to you.

1635
01:32:48,252 --> 01:32:51,688
Okay? I love you,

1636
01:32:52,332 --> 01:32:55,961
and I am not in conflict
about it. Okay?

1637
01:32:56,212 --> 01:32:58,362
But if what you want
is a laundry list

1638
01:32:58,572 --> 01:33:01,882
of things about you that
piss me off, I could give it to you.

1639
01:33:02,132 --> 01:33:04,521
Yeah. I want to hear.
Okay. Well, uh,

1640
01:33:04,692 --> 01:33:09,208
let's start at number one, okay?
Number one, you're fucking nuts.

1641
01:33:09,412 --> 01:33:11,972
All right? You are.
Good luck finding somebody

1642
01:33:12,172 --> 01:33:15,608
to put up with your shit for
more than, like, six months. Okay?

1643
01:33:15,852 --> 01:33:20,209
But I accept the whole package,
the crazy and the brilliant, all right?

1644
01:33:20,412 --> 01:33:24,610
You're not gonna change, I don't want
you to. It's accepting you for being you.

1645
01:33:24,812 --> 01:33:29,840
I asked a question. If, while I was carrying
that double stroller down the stairs

1646
01:33:30,052 --> 01:33:34,125
and getting ass-raped in Pigalle,
you fucked that little Emily Brontë girl?

1647
01:33:34,372 --> 01:33:37,091
I don't know what Emily.
What are you talking about?

1648
01:33:37,332 --> 01:33:39,846
The one that wrote the e-mails
about Dostoevsky?

1649
01:33:40,052 --> 01:33:42,202
"Oh, Jesse, you're so right.

1650
01:33:42,412 --> 01:33:46,725
The Grand Commander is the deepest
passage of all of Russian literature."

1651
01:33:46,933 --> 01:33:48,730
If you're asking me

1652
01:33:48,973 --> 01:33:53,091
if I'm committed to you, the girls
and the life we built together,

1653
01:33:53,293 --> 01:33:56,808
the answer is a resounding yes.

1654
01:33:57,013 --> 01:34:00,244
So you did fuck her.
Thank you very much.

1655
01:34:00,453 --> 01:34:05,322
Do I ask about the time you went to your
old boyfriend after his mother died? No.

1656
01:34:05,573 --> 01:34:09,009
Why? Because I know the way that
your fucking French ass works

1657
01:34:09,213 --> 01:34:13,525
and I guarantee that you at least blew
that guy, but I also know you love me.

1658
01:34:13,733 --> 01:34:17,009
All right? I'm okay with you
being a complicated human being.

1659
01:34:17,253 --> 01:34:21,166
I don't wanna live a boring life where
two people own each other,

1660
01:34:21,373 --> 01:34:25,252
where two people are institutionalized
in a box that others created

1661
01:34:25,453 --> 01:34:26,488
because that is a bunch

1662
01:34:26,653 --> 01:34:29,451
of stifling bullshit!

1663
01:34:29,813 --> 01:34:32,327
Oh, God. Well...

1664
01:34:47,693 --> 01:34:51,083
You know what's going
on here? It's simple.

1665
01:34:52,693 --> 01:34:54,763
I don't think I love you anymore.

1666
01:36:08,614 --> 01:36:10,923
Miss?
I don't wanna talk right now.

1667
01:36:11,134 --> 01:36:13,284
Here by yourself or
waiting for somebody?

1668
01:36:13,534 --> 01:36:15,092
I'm by myself and happy to be.

1669
01:36:15,294 --> 01:36:18,843
I'm an angry person and I hurt my kids,
my work and everyone I love.

1670
01:36:19,054 --> 01:36:21,170
Well, just my type.

1671
01:36:21,374 --> 01:36:24,207
Okay. I'm not in the mood.
I came here to be alone.

1672
01:36:24,414 --> 01:36:28,567
I've just been checking you out,
and I don't wanna make you uncomfortable,

1673
01:36:28,775 --> 01:36:32,131
but you are, by far, the best-looking
woman in this place.

1674
01:36:32,335 --> 01:36:34,690
Thank you.
I'd love to buy you a drink,

1675
01:36:34,895 --> 01:36:37,363
maybe talk to you,
get to know you a bit.

1676
01:36:37,575 --> 01:36:38,974
Are you here on business?

1677
01:36:40,255 --> 01:36:43,167
Okay. I see.
You have a boyfriend?

1678
01:36:43,375 --> 01:36:44,603
Not anymore.

1679
01:36:44,815 --> 01:36:48,012
Jeez, sorry to hear that.
God, you wanna talk about it?

1680
01:36:48,535 --> 01:36:49,968
I don't talk to strangers.

1681
01:36:50,135 --> 01:36:51,966
That's the thing,
I'm not a stranger.

1682
01:36:52,135 --> 01:36:54,012
No, no, no, we've met before.
Oh.

1683
01:36:54,975 --> 01:36:57,045
Summer '94.

1684
01:36:59,015 --> 01:37:01,449
You're mistaking me for
someone else. No.

1685
01:37:01,975 --> 01:37:04,364
We even fell in love.
Really?

1686
01:37:04,535 --> 01:37:06,287
Mm-hm.

1687
01:37:06,535 --> 01:37:10,210
Hm. I vaguely remember
someone sweet and romantic

1688
01:37:10,415 --> 01:37:14,613
who made me feel like I wasn't alone.
Someone who had respect for who I was.

1689
01:37:14,775 --> 01:37:17,573
That's me. I'm that guy.

1690
01:37:18,455 --> 01:37:20,013
I don't think so.
Oh.

1691
01:37:20,215 --> 01:37:23,366
See, I know something about
tonight that you don't know.

1692
01:37:24,135 --> 01:37:25,363
Really? What is that?

1693
01:37:25,935 --> 01:37:28,165
Something important.

1694
01:37:28,495 --> 01:37:33,569
You see, I know because I've actually
already lived through this night.

1695
01:37:33,775 --> 01:37:36,209
How?
I'm a time traveler.

1696
01:37:37,815 --> 01:37:39,089
Okay.

1697
01:37:39,295 --> 01:37:44,005
No, I have a time machine in my room.
I've come to save you, like I said I would.

1698
01:37:44,215 --> 01:37:48,049
Save me from what? From being
blinded by the bullshit of life.

1699
01:37:48,295 --> 01:37:49,489
It's not bullshit.

1700
01:37:49,695 --> 01:37:52,449
I assure you,
that guy you vaguely remember,

1701
01:37:52,656 --> 01:37:55,568
the sweet romantic one
that you met on a train?

1702
01:37:56,816 --> 01:37:57,965
That is me.

1703
01:37:58,576 --> 01:38:00,487
That's you?
Yeah.

1704
01:38:00,696 --> 01:38:03,574
Guess I didn't recognize you.
Hm.

1705
01:38:04,216 --> 01:38:05,569
You look like shit.

1706
01:38:07,176 --> 01:38:10,486
What can I say? I mean,
it's tough out there in time and space.

1707
01:38:10,696 --> 01:38:13,608
You, on the other hand,

1708
01:38:13,816 --> 01:38:16,694
are even more beautiful
than I remember.

1709
01:38:17,696 --> 01:38:18,811
Bullshit.

1710
01:38:19,016 --> 01:38:20,972
Jesse, this is not a game.

1711
01:38:21,136 --> 01:38:25,652
You get all cute, you get in my panties.
And next thing I know, I'm in Chicago.

1712
01:38:25,816 --> 01:38:28,171
Not gonna make it better
by some pick-up line.

1713
01:38:28,376 --> 01:38:31,288
I'm not trying to pick you up.
No, you misunderstand me.

1714
01:38:31,496 --> 01:38:34,294
No, no, no.
I'm only here as a messenger.

1715
01:38:34,496 --> 01:38:37,772
I've just traveled all the way
from the future.

1716
01:38:38,016 --> 01:38:42,214
I was just with
your 82-year-old self

1717
01:38:42,416 --> 01:38:45,931
who gave me a letter
to read to you.

1718
01:38:46,136 --> 01:38:47,489
So here I am.

1719
01:38:48,016 --> 01:38:49,847
I'm still alive in my 80's?

1720
01:38:50,056 --> 01:38:52,854
Oh, yeah.
Mm-hm.

1721
01:38:53,016 --> 01:38:55,246
How's my French ass?
Nice.

1722
01:38:55,456 --> 01:38:57,412
Okay.
Really nice.

1723
01:38:57,656 --> 01:39:01,285
I don't care about the way I look.
There's more of you to love.

1724
01:39:01,536 --> 01:39:03,527
Great. You want me
to read it to you?

1725
01:39:03,736 --> 01:39:06,569
Do I have a choice?
Sure. If you're not interested...

1726
01:39:06,736 --> 01:39:08,010
No, no, no.

1727
01:39:08,216 --> 01:39:11,526
Read it.
Okay. All right. Well, here it is.

1728
01:39:11,736 --> 01:39:16,811
"Dear Celine, I am writing to you
from the other side of the woods.

1729
01:39:17,017 --> 01:39:20,487
- This letter is lighting a candle
that will... " - Okay, stop it.

1730
01:39:20,697 --> 01:39:24,212
I would never write this.
"Other side of the woods." What woods?

1731
01:39:24,417 --> 01:39:26,567
May I please continue?
Okay.

1732
01:39:26,777 --> 01:39:29,689
I am sending you this young man.

1733
01:39:29,937 --> 01:39:31,336
Yes, young.

1734
01:39:31,537 --> 01:39:34,734
And he will be your escort.

1735
01:39:34,937 --> 01:39:39,089
God knows he has many problems
and has struggled his whole life

1736
01:39:39,297 --> 01:39:44,655
connecting and being present,
even with those he loves the most.

1737
01:39:44,857 --> 01:39:47,849
And for that he is deeply sorry.

1738
01:39:48,897 --> 01:39:50,808
But you are his only hope.

1739
01:39:52,417 --> 01:39:56,330
Celine, my advice to you is this.

1740
01:39:56,977 --> 01:39:59,491
You're entering the best years
of your life.

1741
01:39:59,697 --> 01:40:02,575
Looking back from where I sit now,

1742
01:40:03,537 --> 01:40:06,768
these middle years are only
a little bit more difficult

1743
01:40:07,017 --> 01:40:08,689
than when you were 12

1744
01:40:08,937 --> 01:40:12,816
and Mathieu and Vanessa
danced all night

1745
01:40:13,017 --> 01:40:15,577
to the Bee Gees'
"How Deep Is Your Love."

1746
01:40:15,817 --> 01:40:17,933
I don't know about that. Anyway.

1747
01:40:18,137 --> 01:40:20,287
"Celine, you will be fine.

1748
01:40:20,497 --> 01:40:24,570
Your girls will grow up to become
examples and icons of feminism."

1749
01:40:24,737 --> 01:40:26,614
Nice one.
Yeah.

1750
01:40:26,817 --> 01:40:30,492
I just noticed there's a postscript
at the bottom. Looks important.

1751
01:40:30,697 --> 01:40:32,688
Maybe I should skip over
some of this.

1752
01:40:32,897 --> 01:40:34,649
Yeah, skip away. Please.
Okay.

1753
01:40:34,857 --> 01:40:36,529
You sure? Yeah, okay.
Yeah.

1754
01:40:36,738 --> 01:40:38,330
All right.
Boring stuff.

1755
01:40:38,538 --> 01:40:43,168
Yeah. Okay. Yeah, it's like,
blah, blah, blah, financial tips,

1756
01:40:43,378 --> 01:40:45,812
horoscope stuff. Okay, here it is.

1757
01:40:46,058 --> 01:40:50,574
"P.S. By the way, the best..." Oh.

1758
01:40:51,658 --> 01:40:56,732
"By the way, the best sex of my life
happened one night

1759
01:40:56,938 --> 01:40:59,691
in the southern Peloponnese.

1760
01:40:59,898 --> 01:41:01,809
Don't miss it.

1761
01:41:02,018 --> 01:41:07,615
My whole sexual being went
to a new, ground-breaking level."

1762
01:41:07,818 --> 01:41:10,730
Ground-breaking. Great.
I don't know what that means.

1763
01:41:10,938 --> 01:41:13,657
Okay, Jesse, can you
stop this stupid game?

1764
01:41:14,098 --> 01:41:17,693
We're not in one of
your stories. Okay?

1765
01:41:18,058 --> 01:41:22,290
Did you hear what I said to you back
in the room? Did you hear me?

1766
01:41:22,938 --> 01:41:25,975
Yes, I heard you.

1767
01:41:26,698 --> 01:41:29,292
What, that you don't
love me anymore?

1768
01:41:30,018 --> 01:41:33,693
I figured you didn't mean it,
but if you did, then, uh...

1769
01:41:34,258 --> 01:41:38,536
Oh, fuck it. Know something? You're just
like the little girls and everybody else.

1770
01:41:38,778 --> 01:41:40,769
You wanna live inside
some fairy tale.

1771
01:41:40,978 --> 01:41:43,128
I'm just trying to
make things better.

1772
01:41:43,338 --> 01:41:46,091
I tell you I love you,
I tell you you're beautiful,

1773
01:41:46,258 --> 01:41:49,330
I tell you that your ass looks great
when you're 80.

1774
01:41:49,618 --> 01:41:50,767
Huh?

1775
01:41:51,018 --> 01:41:54,135
I'm trying to make you laugh.
Okay.

1776
01:41:54,378 --> 01:41:57,575
All right, I put up with
plenty of your shit.

1777
01:41:57,938 --> 01:42:02,137
And if you think I'm just some dog who's
gonna keep coming back, you're wrong.

1778
01:42:02,339 --> 01:42:06,218
But if you want true love,
then this is it.

1779
01:42:06,419 --> 01:42:09,252
This is real life.
It's not perfect, but it's real.

1780
01:42:09,459 --> 01:42:13,577
And if you can't see it,
then you're blind, all right, and I give up.

1781
01:42:22,219 --> 01:42:24,414
Oh, God.

1782
01:42:51,659 --> 01:42:54,173
So, what about this time machine?

1783
01:42:57,419 --> 01:42:59,250
What do you mean?

1784
01:42:59,499 --> 01:43:01,455
How does it work?

1785
01:43:03,179 --> 01:43:05,374
Well, it's complicated.

1786
01:43:09,099 --> 01:43:12,330
Am I gonna have to
get naked to operate it?

1787
01:43:14,859 --> 01:43:16,178
I mean...

1788
01:43:16,419 --> 01:43:20,014
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's actually...
It's been a real issue, you know?

1789
01:43:20,259 --> 01:43:24,776
I mean, I... Clothes, they don't travel well
through the whole space-time continuum.

1790
01:43:24,980 --> 01:43:26,493
It's...

1791
01:43:28,220 --> 01:43:30,290
Wow. You're so smart.

1792
01:43:30,460 --> 01:43:32,496
Ha, ha. Oh, jeez.

1793
01:43:32,700 --> 01:43:35,897
Space-time...?
Continuum.

1794
01:43:36,500 --> 01:43:40,209
Continuum.
Yeah. Really.

1795
01:43:40,780 --> 01:43:44,329
There's something that I've been
thinking about, about your letter.

1796
01:43:44,540 --> 01:43:46,610
Yeah?
You know, you, uh...

1797
01:43:46,820 --> 01:43:49,573
You mentioned the southern
Peloponnese?

1798
01:43:49,780 --> 01:43:53,011
Yeah, yeah, and we're
in the southern Peloponnese.

1799
01:43:53,180 --> 01:43:54,295
Mm-hm.

1800
01:43:54,500 --> 01:43:56,934
Yeah, and do you think
it could be tonight

1801
01:43:57,140 --> 01:44:00,337
that you're still talking about
in your 80's?

1802
01:44:00,620 --> 01:44:02,178
Well...

1803
01:44:03,580 --> 01:44:07,016
it must have been one hell
of a night we're about to have.
