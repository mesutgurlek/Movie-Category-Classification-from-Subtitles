343
00:27:58,247 -> 00:28:00,247

Why?

355
00:28:28,051 -> 00:28:31,051

the groom and best friend to be angry

724 
01:01:12,966 -> 01:01:14,966 
Ever happened to you on the road

728 
01:01:25,234 -> 01:01:27,234

729 
01:01:28,408 -> 01:01:31,408 
exprecion the problem with this is 
that is common and saves that which is fine. 

730 
01:01:33,414 -> 01:01:35,414 
Or is it? 

731 
01:01:37,944 -> 01:01:39,944 
now anything 
happens between you and that girl 

732 
01:01:40,245 -> 01:01:42,245 
're going to end now. 
Dad. 

733 
01:01:42,614 -> 01:01:44,614

saves what I'm saying. 

734 
01:01:47,677 -> 01:01:49,677

735 
01:01:51,533 -> 01:01:53,533 
Yes, sir. 

736 
01:02:01,398 -> 01:02:03,398

737 
01:02:04,691 -> 01:02:08,691

739 
01:02:15,408 -> 01:02:17,408

741 
01:02:24,364 -> 01:02:26,364 
I want, but ... 
Darcy is back so ... 

742 
01:02:29,160 -> 01:02:31,160 
or, if. 
should ... 

743 
01:02:34,543 -> 01:02:36,543 
Rachel just have to know ... 

744 
01:02:37,806 -> 01:02:39,806 
I said this morning ...

745 
01:02:43,463 -> 01:02:45,463 
I told a lie. 

746 
01:02:58,479 -> 01:03:02,479 
did he say? 
Ethan is complicated! 

747 
01:03:06,197 -> 01:03:08,197 
do not. 

748 
01:03:08,554 -> 01:03:10,554 
Tell me, what? 
Rachel is not complicated ... 

749 
01:03:11,413 -> 01:03:13,413 
is an asshole. 
and to be honest were a bit stupid. 

750 
01:03:14,516 -> 01:03:16,516 
I was the stupid? 
yes. 

751 
01:03:17,744 -> 01:03:19,744 
I looked at you a lot, 
and the worst part is that you were leaving it. 

752 
01:03:21,146 -> 01:03:23,146 
As you left that you wanted 
Rachel at their wedding on their first anniversary? 

753 
01:03:24,891 -> 01:03:26,891 
Ethan are not even married! 
exactly, Rachel 

754 
01:03:27,597 -> 01:03:29,597 
not married yet! 

755 
01:03:29,815 -> 01:03:32,815 
what can segnifica 
change the situation anytime. 

756 
01:03:33,319 -> 01:03:35,319 
but it does not! 
or does it? 

757 
01:03:36,806 -> 01:03:38,806 
at least I've seen 
or spoken since July 4? 

758 
01:03:42,633 -> 01:03:44,633 
Rachel when you volvistes in 
such women? 

759 
01:03:45,678 -> 01:03:47,678 
Rachel wait! ... Still waiting ... 

760 
01:03:49,474 -> 01:03:51,474 
So I have not seen you exactly 
were happy then ... 

761 
01:03:54,197 -> 01:03:56,197 
but at least I tried. 
I have had opportunities. 

762 
01:03:56,297 -> 01:03:54,198 
may're right. 

763 
01:03:56,893 -> 01:03:58,893 
when? 
when is the last time tuvistes a chance? 

764 
01:03:59,304 -> 01:04:01,304 
two days ago. 
and decided to go to London. 

765 
01:04:01,890 -> 01:04:04,890 
what? 
if I move there. 

766 
01:04:05,915 -> 01:04:07,915 
ivas when I say it? 

767 
01:04:08,294 -> 01:04:10,294 
today, now. 

768 
01:04:16,450 -> 01:04:18,450 
There is an audience that is 
interested in my work. 

769 
01:04:20,602 -> 01:04:22,602 
Ethan is amazing. 

770 
01:04:24,249 -> 01:04:26,249 
hey, you want 
make you a gift? 

771 
01:04:26,479 -> 01:04:28,479 
what? 

772 
01:04:28,625 -> 01:04:30,625 
tell your boyfriend to make a decision. 

773 
01:04:57,503 -> 01:04:59,503 
so when I was in bed last night. 

774 
01:04:59,794 -> 01:05:03,794 
I was thinking about you. 
I was wondering if I should get a straw or not 

775 
01:05:05,868 -> 01:05:07,868 
but the thing is not 
I left. 

776 
01:05:08,068 -> 01:05:10,068 
but never happened to me, I step 
my 

777 
01:05:11,038 -> 01:05:15,038 
so do not think you're 
very good, really. 

778 
01:05:15,491 -> 01:05:17,491 
is all that I 
you're good 

779 
01:05:17,502 -> 01:05:19,502 
I do not feel alone 
I can fail you. 

780 
01:05:25,367 -> 01:05:28,367 
how you can make the worst words 
that sound charming. 

781 
01:05:28,608 -> 01:05:30,608 
is a compliment, right? 
ofcourse. 

782 
01:05:32,318 -> 01:05:34,318 
so 
I bet they think is 

783 
01:05:34,459 -> 01:05:36,459 
that 

784 
01:05:37,265 -> 01:05:39,265 
home. 

785 
01:05:39,900 -> 01:05:41,900 
that house? 

786 
01:05:41,937 -> 01:05:43,937 
the house is doing 
for Dex and Darcy. 

787 
01:05:45,463 -> 01:05:47,463 
Dex did not tell you? 

788 
01:05:47,720 -> 01:05:49,720 
yes, yes

816 
01:07:50,303 -> 01:07:52,303 
"From: Dex

01:08:42,430 -> 01:08:44,430 
that the ranch Marcus is expensive. 

826 
01:08:48,988 -> 01:08:50,988

my best friend in the world ...

857 
01:10:22,499 -> 01:10:24,499 
not now. 

858 
01:10:27,624 -> 01:10:29,624 
5,6,7,8! 

859 
01:11:21,989 -> 01:11:25,989 
who sap our little friends 
paste will be the end? 

860 
01:11:27,766 -> 01:11:29,766 
I'm happy it's Ethan. 

861 
01:11:31,187 -> 01:11:33,187 
yo tambien. 

862 
01:11:34,605 ??-> 01:11:36,605 
made a foray into the world 

863 
01:11:38,238 -> 01:11:40,238 
no. 

864 
01:11:40,846 -> 01:11:42,846 
no one can understand how you, 
not even Dexter. 

865 
01:11:46,900 -> 01:11:48,900 
not as you do. 

866 
01:11:49,874 -> 01:11:51,874 
so, you ... 
I totally acceptastes 

867 
01:11:55,630 -> 01:11:57,630 
because I say all this? 

868 
01:12:00,640 -> 01:12:02,640 
I do not know ... 

869 
01:12:06,117 -> 01:12:09,117 
when you marry, you think 
all your best moments of your life y. .. 

870 
01:12:12,709 -> 01:12:14,709 
you are in all. 

871 
01:12:17,048 -> 01:12:19,048 
me too! 

872 
01:12:32,006 -> 01:12:34,006 
Darcy. 

873 
01:12:39,974 -> 01:12:41,974 
I have to tell you something. 

874 
01:12:49,968 -> 01:12:51,968 
something I've done. 

875 
01:12:53,367 -> 01:12:56,367 
Rachel ... 
I love you. 

876 
01:12:58,266 -> 01:13:01,266 
I will never let anyone hurt you, 
ever. 

877 
01:13:04,317 -> 01:13:06,317 
and you're not going to let anyone 
I hurt, right? 

878 
01:13:07,003 -> 01:13:09,003 
no. 

879 
01:13:35,618 -> 01:13:37,618 
Rachel! 

880 
01:13:40,000 -> 01:13:42,000 
Rachel 

881 
01:13:42,646 -> 01:13:44,646 
good morning. 

882 
01:13:44,703 -> 01:13:46,703 
think I have Dex should marry? 

883 
01:13:49,234 -> 01:13:50,234 
what? 

884 
01:13:50,345 -> 01:13:52,345 
I'm serious. 
think it's a good ideea? 

885 
01:13:53,388 -> 01:13:55,388 
I mean 
nobody knows me like you. 

886 
01:13:55,760 -> 01:13:57,760 
and you're the one hand as Dexter. 
and you're smarter than me. 

887 
01:13:58,335 -> 01:14:00,335 
I mean a little list 
in every way, but ... 

888 
01:14:00,775 -> 01:14:02,775 
I'm trying to say is ... 

889 
01:14:02,897 -> 01:14:04,897 
I would not do something stupid, right? 

890 
01:14:05,656 -> 01:14:07,656 
Darcy?! 

891 
01:14:07,794 -> 01:14:09,794 
I mean no, 
because ... 

892 
01:14:10,416 -> 01:14:13,416 
I think that really 
I make a nonsense ... 

893 
01:14:15,874 -> 01:14:17,874 
that I want, really want it. 

894 
01:14:19,217 -> 01:14:21,217 
and what the vee me! 
what? 

895 
01:14:23,569 -> 01:14:25,569 
saves what I mean. 

896 
01:14:25,786 -> 01:14:27,786 
I knew no one like me. 

897 
01:14:28,422 -> 01:14:31,422 
because ... 
I do not let good things for me. 

898 
01:14:32,083 -> 01:14:35,083 
which is a kind of truth 
because I've always thought that all 

899 
01:14:35,146 -> 01:14:37,146 
be solved, as always. 

900 
01:14:38,110 -> 01:14:43,110 
so I do softer 
and makes me heavier, or something. 

901 
01:14:46,841 -> 01:14:48,841 
make sense? 
have. 

902 
01:14:48,941 -> 01:14:46,926 
in the good way. 

903 
01:14:52,531 -> 01:14:54,531 
and what you said you in your 

904 
01:14:56,492 -> 01:14:58,492 
I felt it. 
especially when you said ... 

905 
01:15:02,973 -> 01:15:04,973 
more accurate which is what you said? 

906 
01:15:05,382 -> 01:15:07,382 
life would be unimaginable without. 
yes. 

907 
01:15:08,751 -> 01:15:10,751 
because I'm not to get married. 

908 
01:15:14,241 -> 01:15:16,241 
I think ... 

909 
01:15:18,585 -> 01:15:20,585 
if? 

910 
01:15:21,664 -> 01:15:24,664 
you must marry. 

911 
01:15:29,881 -> 01:15:31,881 
I love you. 

912 
01:15:32,328 -> 01:15:34,328 
I love Darcy. 

913 
01:15:35,895 -> 01:15:37,895 
You're the best friend in the world. 

914 
01:15:43,227 -> 01:15:46,227 
then it is okay if you 
somehow I have horns? 

915 
01:15:47,308 -> 01:15:49,308 
what? 

916 
01:15:50,007 -> 01:15:52,007 
I did it just once. 

917 
01:15:52,835 -> 01:15:54,835 
with whom? 
well ... 

918 
01:15:55,242 -> 01:15:58,242 
work was a boy 
and it was not only sex. 

919 
01:16:00,080 -> 01:16:02,080 
and I felt horrible. 

920 
01:16:03,334 -> 01:16:05,334 
then this is good? 
if? 

921 
01:16:06,714 -> 01:16:09,714 
because I did not and Dex 
love from before July 4th! 

922 
01:16:11,960 -> 01:16:13,960 
I got so happy estopy 
this off my chest. 

923 
01:16:14,741 -> 01:16:16,741 
I hate feeling guilty 
hate 

924 
01:16:18,062 -> 01:16:20,062 
I feel much better now. 

925 
01:16:20,444 -> 01:16:22,444 
or God! 
so when are you gonna say? 

926 
01:16:23,489 -> 01:16:26,489 
I want to tell you? 
I would love decircelo. 

927 
01:16:26,528 -> 01:16:27,528 
is not your thing. 

928 
01:16:27,679 -> 01:16:29,679 
I told her to marry. 
so I go out outside. 

929 
01:16:29,994 -> 01:16:31,994 
Rachel, just say I'm cheating! 

930 
01:16:32,248 -> 01:16:34,248 
you wanted your chance, so 
to take it. 

931 
01:16:38,321 -> 01:16:40,321 
ne understand how 
leave it to win always. 

932 
01:16:40,421 -> 01:16:38,362 
I do not understand. 

933 
01:16:38,462 -> 01:16:36,391 
Ethan! Ends. 

934 
01:16:40,416 -> 01:16:42,416 
wow! 
no, nothing like wow! 

935 
01:16:43,031 -> 01:16:46,031 
because the cards are turned back 
you really think she'd let you win? 

936 
01:16:46,115 -> 01:16:48,115 
want to stop? 
what about you two? 

937 
01:16:50,397 -> 01:16:52,397 
do not hate! 
I hate the fact that always beats you at every turn. 

938 
01:16:52,498 -> 01:16:50,407 
that you hate so much? 
you speak? 

939 
01:16:54,083 -> 01:16:56,083 
so that you do? 

940 
01:16:56,163 -> 01:16:58,163 
that you let you win? 

941 
01:16:58,460 -> 01:17:00,460 
that this is what 
Darcy does! 

942 
01:17:00,601 -> 01:17:01,601 
Darcy wins, he always does. 

943 
01:17:01,888 -> 01:17:03,888 
she sees things, wants and gets. 

944 
01:17:04,854 -> 01:17:08,854 
Ethan, she got her promotion. 
saves hard it is to enter a building? 

945 
01:17:09,227 -> 01:17:11,227 
is impossible. 
but she did. 

946 
01:17:11,645 -> 01:17:13,645 
and their merits! 

947 
01:17:14,883 -> 01:17:16,883 
these jokes. 
right? 

948 
01:17:17,256 -> 01:17:19,256 
're not joking? 
seen the letter of the test? 

949 
01:17:19,423 -> 01:17:21,423 
because I say it? 
Rachel saw the letter of tests? 

950 
01:17:21,938 -> 01:17:23,938 
I saw that. 

951 
01:17:24,170 -> 01:17:26,170 
Remember when you ask the 
promotion of Michael Jordan? 

952 
01:17:26,560 -> 01:17:28,560 
and they sent him four 
letters to her and could not get it. 

953 
01:17:28,790 -> 01:17:30,790 
teach you many times that letter? 
I can not remember right now. 

954 
01:17:30,840 -> 01:17:32,840 
and that was his rejection. 

955 
01:17:32,916 -> 01:17:36,916 
really think if it was accepted 
the letter also raised Havia? 

956 
01:17:37,264 -> 01:17:39,264 
Rachel, come on. 

957 
01:17:39,875 -> 01:17:41,875 
never had his name on the letter. 

958 
01:17:46,375 -> 01:17:48,375 
Rachel! 

959 
01:17:48,438 -> 01:17:51,438 
OK, look what I understand. 
this is hard because you want to party. 

960 
01:17:51,585 -> 01:17:54,585 
but you have to do something with Rachel. 
because has been totally cowardly. 

961 
01:17:54,616 -> 01:17:56,616 
and if part of your heart, I have 
hit some punches. 

962 
01:17:56,631 -> 01:17:58,631 
or probably going to paste. 
I have to get to work, I'm taking. 

963 
01:17:58,830 -> 01:18:00,830 
I know! Rachel that is the point 
late 

964 
01:18:01,119 -> 01:18:03,119 
better now, just 
at least take a decision. 

965 
01:18:03,862 -> 01:18:05,862 
Rachel! 
 going to hell in every way.

01:30:28,227 -> 01:30:30,227 
and you need time you? 
are you kidding? 

1124 
01:30:30,767 -> 01:30:32,767 
I ... 

1125 
01:30:32,798 -> 01:30:34,798 
Rachel, Rachel, the band is stuck 

1126 
01:30:37,066 -> 01:30:39,066 
the cattering is a nightmare. 
I need you back here now. 

1127 
01:30:39,637 -> 01:30:41,637 
Darcy! 
now. 

1128 
01:30:44,856 -> 01:30:46,856 
no. 

1129 
01:30:47,518 -> 01:30:49,518 
wow! 
who the fuck? 

1130 
01:30:50,909 -> 01:30:52,909 
want to be your maid of honor? 

1131 
01:30:54,714 -> 01:30:56,714 
or, my God. 
I can do. 

1132 
01:31:04,244 -> 01:31:07,244 
I dreamed of marrying Darcy 
all my life. 

1133 
01:31:08,088 -> 01:31:10,088 
and not as I am close to those 
promises! 

1134 
01:31:12,715 -> 01:31:14,715 
as she says "my work" 

1135 
01:31:14,753 -> 01:31:16,753 
I think you had 
have said that this engalando. 

1136 
01:31:17,068 -> 01:31:20,068 
no, I did not want to take by default. 

1137 
01:31:22,838 -> 01:31:24,838 
I want to be the first 
choosing someone. 

1138 
01:31:25,724 -> 01:31:28,724 
if ... 
are! 

1139 
01:31:29,729 -> 01:31:31,729 
No, I ... 
I'm not saying. 

1140 
01:31:35,880 -> 01:31:37,880 
at least the first 
choosing someone. 

1141 
01:31:37,980 -> 01:31:35,923 
I'm not your first choice. 

1142 
01:31:50,664 -> 01:31:52,664 
what? 

1143 
01:31:54,408 -> 01:31:56,408 
you have not ever asked me. 

1144 
01:31:58,091 -> 01:32:00,091 
not how to tell you. 

1145 
01:32:01,821 -> 01:32:03,821 
God, I like Rachel. 

1146 
01:32:06,568 -> 01:32:08,568 
I've always liked. 

1147 
01:32:11,458 -> 01:32:13,458 
I've liked even more. 

1148 
01:32:13,558 -> 01:32:11,487 
and when another girl appeared 
in pictures ... 

1149 
01:32:15,565 -> 01:32:17,565 
you are ... 

1150 
01:32:17,645 -> 01:32:19,645 
home for me. 

1151 
01:32:22,830 -> 01:32:24,830 
wow, that sounds crazy. 

1152 
01:32:26,398 -> 01:32:28,398 
and that is probably 
just crazy. 

1153 
01:32:31,450 -> 01:32:33,450 
not love. 

1154 
01:32:34,638 -> 01:32:36,638 
but it feels like ... 

1155 
01:32:39,993 -> 01:32:41,993 
do not laugh. 

1156 
01:32:42,311 -> 01:32:44,311 
my love is not my type. 

1157 
01:32:47,343 -> 01:32:49,343 
Bebo Rosé and see movies all day. 

1158 
01:32:49,443 -> 01:32:47,399 
God when I fall, I ... 

1159 
01:32:57,523 -> 01:32:59,523 
Rachel can not be 
I just .. 

1160 
01:33:01,115 -> 01:33:03,115 
... I miss you. 

1161 
01:33:08,501 -> 01:33:10,501 
but I think you love someone else. 

1162 
01:33:16,700 -> 01:33:20,700 
I think ... 
they still are. 

1163 
01:33:36,038 -> 01:33:38,038 
to shit ... 

1164 
01:33:38,918 -> 01:33:40,918 
the sap 
had to be gone for Claire. 

1165 
01:34:13,156 -> 01:34:15,156 
or, well 
these wakes. 

1166 
01:34:17,069 -> 01:34:19,069 
Ethan! 

1167 
01:34:19,130 ??-> 01:34:21,130 
we can call? 
well ... 

1168 
01:34:22,744 -> 01:34:25,744 
I think the two 
the sap that I miss. 

1169 
01:34:25,889 -> 01:34:27,889 
no, not return to it. 

1170 
01:34:31,494 -> 01:34:33,494 
This is not me. 

1171 
01:34:34,439 -> 01:34:37,439 
I can not do what I want 
and hurt everyone. 

1172 
01:34:37,798 -> 01:34:39,798 
What's more, Darcy did nothing wrong. 

1173 
01:34:40,020 -> 01:34:42,020 
I did. 
or, my God I can not hear Rachel 

1174 
01:34:42,188 -> 01:34:44,188 
this "Dad hit me because I do not like 
my stuff more " 

1175 
01:34:44,495 -> 01:34:46,495 
this is me being empathic 

1176 
01:34:48,455 -> 01:34:50,455 
Darcy always thought it was .. 

1177 
01:34:51,435 -> 01:34:54,435 
who took my things, but it was 
I who gave it. 

1178 
01:34:57,135 -> 01:34:59,135 
Darcy and possibly ... 

1179 
01:35:01,094 -> 01:35:03,094 
whatever it is ... 
is not Darcy. 

1180 
01:35:04,520 -> 01:35:06,520 
but she is my best friend. 

1181 
01:35:06,972 -> 01:35:08,972 
and I want to be there 
for her. 

1182 
01:35:09,763 -> 01:35:11,763 
so I'm going to that wedding. 

1183 
01:35:20,127 -> 01:35:22,127 
then you've won. 

1184 
01:35:50,474 -> 01:35:52,474 
as you ... 

1185 
01:35:53,339 -> 01:35:55,339 
call your office. 

1186 
01:35:55,687 -> 01:35:57,687 
I wanted to be here when you arrived. 

1187 
01:35:59,116 -> 01:36:01,116 
have to go. 

1188 
01:36:02,160 -> 01:36:04,160 
I can not do this anymore. 

1189 
01:36:06,211 -> 01:36:08,211 
she deserves better. 
and you too. 

1190 
01:36:09,125 -> 01:36:11,125 
so I will not. 

1191 
01:36:15,372 -> 01:36:17,372 
named it after the wedding. 

1192 
01:36:26,943 -> 01:36:28,943 
I told him I could not marry her. 

1193 
01:36:30,811 -> 01:36:32,811 
when? 

1194 
01:36:33,837 -> 01:36:35,837 
few hours ago. 

1195 
01:36:44,083 -> 01:36:46,083 
who said it? 

1196 
01:36:46,966 -> 01:36:48,966 
he did? 
is quite angry. 

1197 
01:36:50,626 -> 01:36:52,626 
more so 
people will think. 

1198 
01:36:54,461 -> 01:36:56,461 
and went through some things 

1199 
01:36:56,910 -> 01:36:58,910 
You told him about us. 

1200 
01:36:59,853 -> 01:37:01,853 
said that if the other girl. 

1201 
01:37:02,349 -> 01:37:04,349 
I said no. 

1202 
01:37:05,977 -> 01:37:07,977 
because I'm not sure 
she is still ... 

1203 
01:37:10,055 -> 01:37:12,055 
I ... 
not to say. 

1204 
01:37:12,205 -> 01:37:14,205 
I expect nothing. 

1205 
01:37:14,959 -> 01:37:16,959 
deserve no wait at all. 

1206 
01:37:18,567 -> 01:37:20,567 
I was afraid. 

1207 
01:37:20,931 -> 01:37:22,931 
to make the people suffer. 

1208 
01:37:23,081 -> 01:37:25,081 
and I just want to thank you. 

1209 
01:37:25,866 -> 01:37:27,866 
to say in the end all you wanted. 

1210 
01:37:30,638 -> 01:37:32,638 
and help me 
aa do the same. 

1211 
01:37:35,514 -> 01:37:37,514 
I ask forgiveness. 

1212 
01:37:40,484 -> 01:37:42,484 
to be a coward 
outside the bar for 6 years. 

1213 
01:37:46,158 -> 01:37:48,158 
Jay and out of last week. 

1214 
01:37:51,388 -> 01:37:53,388 
 I did the worst. 
decision of my life. 

1215 
01:37:58,723 -> 01:38:02,723 
basically do not have to 
never speak outside the bar. 

1216 
01:38:13,171 -> 01:38:15,171 
Rachel opens. 

1217 
01:38:19,567 -> 01:38:21,567 
yes. 
opens the door. 

1218 
01:38:21,667 -> 01:38:19,612 
Darcy! 

1219 
01:38:21,606 -> 01:38:23,606 
as you entered the building? 

1220 
01:38:23,971 -> 01:38:25,971 
I opened some guys 
who cares, let me enter. 

1221 
01:38:26,999 -> 01:38:28,999 
I have to talk to you. 

1222 
01:38:34,205 -> 01:38:36,205 
I see your ass, open the door. 

1223 
01:38:36,305 -> 01:38:34,211 
if a. .. 
estoi me changing clothes ... 

1224 
01:38:40,370 -> 01:38:42,370 
I canceled the wedding 

1225 
01:38:44,647 -> 01:38:46,647 
what did you do? 
well ... 

1226 
01:38:46,941 -> 01:38:49,941 
Dex was technically 
but I was thinking the same thing. 

1227 
01:38:52,413 -> 01:38:54,413 
I think I need some air, 
let's go outside. 

1228 
01:38:54,728 -> 01:38:56,728 
no. 
I want to be sitting. 

1229 
01:38:57,901 -> 01:38:59,901 
tell you before 
I came to your house. 

1230 
01:39:01,064 -> 01:39:03,064 
I just want to say no 
Aoy the only one of us. 

1231 
01:39:03,894 -> 01:39:05,894 
who was wrong here. 

1232 
01:39:09,022 -> 01:39:11,022 
injustice that mean? 

1233 
01:39:12,025 -> 01:39:14,025 
please. 

1234 
01:39:14,481 -> 01:39:16,481 
give me some credibility Rachel. 

1235 
01:39:17,867 -> 01:39:19,867 
Clairte Ethan says he lied 

1236 
01:39:20,610 -> 01:39:23,610 
be sure you were not with 
Marcus. 

1237 
01:39:23,700 -> 01:39:25,700 
so that these invented istory 
for me? 

1238 
01:39:26,238 -> 01:39:28,238 
agar for me. 

1239 
01:39:28,427 -> 01:39:30,427 
saves I'm sexier than you. 
always have been. 

1240 
01:39:30,764 -> 01:39:32,764 
I do not ...

1241 
01:39:35,042 -> 01:39:37,042 
saves waiting as ever 
I slept with Marcus? 

1242 
01:39:38,582 -> 01:39:40,582 
decistes because he was circumcised. 

1243 
01:39:42,572 -> 01:39:44,572 
worth. 

1244 
01:39:44,903 -> 01:39:46,903 
and it is not. 

1245 
01:39:48,743 -> 01:39:50,743 
Marcus on the guy 
acostastes with you? 

1246 
01:39:51,045 -> 01:39:53,045 
is what I wanted to tell you. 

1247 
01:39:55,519 -> 01:39:57,519

when you acostastes with? 

1248 
01:39:57,619 -> 01:39:55,532 
you can bring me water? 

1249 
01:39:58,764 -> 01:40:00,764 
July 4. 

1250 
01:40:01,563 -> 01:40:03,563 
the two were alone 
and two sparks. 

1251 
01:40:04,214 -> 01:40:06,214 
and we both 
feel horrible. 

1252 
01:40:08,820 -> 01:40:11,820 
we promised each other 
we're not going to do it again 

1253 
01:40:15,206 -> 01:40:17,206 
and promised. 
and we did otravez 

1254 
01:40:19,977 -> 01:40:21,977 
acostastes with you more than once. 

1255 
01:40:24,163 -> 01:40:26,163 
Marcus and I ... 
we have a ... 

1256 
01:40:27,206 -> 01:40:30,206 
sit down. 
connection. 

1257 
01:40:30,653 -> 01:40:32,653 
we have a very powerful connection. 

1258 
01:40:33,697 -> 01:40:35,697 
is like ... 

1259 
01:40:36,138 -> 01:40:38,138 
genetically. 

1260 
01:40:43,564 -> 01:40:45,564 
whatever. 
I'm not a bad person. 

1261 
01:40:46,902 -> 01:40:48,902 
I'm trying to say is ... 

1262 
01:40:48,979 -> 01:40:50,979 
I need you now more than ever. 

1263 
01:40:55,345 -> 01:40:57,345 
I did a test. 

1264 
01:40:58,914 -> 01:41:00,914 
're pregnant? 
yes. 

1265 
01:41:03,071 -> 01:41:05,071 
is crazy. 

1266 
01:41:05,990 -> 01:41:07,990 
I mean, and good. 

1267 
01:41:08,788 -> 01:41:10,788 
I mean that Marcus has been 
incredible. 

1268 
01:41:11,337 -> 01:41:13,337 
he is not as 
you think. 

1269 
01:41:15,335 -> 01:41:17,335 
whether, if a man cave 
is totally a man cave. 

1270 
01:41:19,662 -> 01:41:21,662 
but once did ... 

1271 
01:41:21,662 -> 01:41:24,662 
made some small tablets 
for a small squirrels. 

1272 
01:41:25,182 -> 01:41:27,182 
with broken legs. 

1273 
01:41:27,252 -> 01:41:29,252 
is not the sweetest thing you've 
Aguna heard again? 

1274 
01:41:29,973 -> 01:41:31,973 
I have to go, this 
down waiting for me. 

1275 
01:41:32,579 -> 01:41:34,579 
I love you. 

1276 
01:41:38,812 -> 01:41:40,812 
is crazy. 

1277 
01:41:41,408 -> 01:41:43,408 
how things will turn around, right? 

1278 
01:42:05,536 -> 01:42:07,536 
Dexter is chequeta? 

1279 
01:42:12,365 -> 01:42:14,365 
you doing here? 

1280 
01:42:17,234 -> 01:42:19,234 
or leave it in the 
Restaurant last week. 

1281 
01:42:20,156 -> 01:42:24,156 
no, no, he did not.
