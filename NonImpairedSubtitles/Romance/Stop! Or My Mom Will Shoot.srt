1
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,039
These bad guys are always late.
- They'll be here.

2
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,278
When, Tony?
We've been sitting here two hours.

3
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:37,118
The meeting's been planned for weeks.
They'll be here. Be patient, alright?

4
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:41,309
Yeah, so will the Easter bunny,
and my next birthday!

5
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:44,188
And guess what...

6
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,910
It's about goddamm time!

7
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,674
Got the money?

8
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,430
No, food stamps.
- I don't trust this dude.

9
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,913
I deal in stolen merchandise.
I'm not very trustworthy.

10
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,594
You show up late...

11
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,356
and then you ask dumb questions.
- Could be a cop.

12
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:23,952
Or Elvis or the Wizard of Oz.
Oo you want to deal or not?

13
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,799
Alright, show him the stuff.

14
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,474
Come on. Hurry up. I'm late.

15
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,635
Back off!
- Really?

16
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,758
Police! Stop!

17
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,878
Nobody listens.

18
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,836
Tony, get over here!

19
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,639
Come on!

20
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,513
I'm hit.

21
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,948
Where? I can't move my leg.
It's not your leg,

22
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,874
you've got glass in your ass!

23
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:27,036
First these guys show up late,
and then they ask dumb questions.

24
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,398
Then they shoot you in the ass.
They're pissing me off!

25
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,909
Beginner's luck!

26
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,833
68...

27
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,638
69...

28
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,354
70...

29
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,274
Joe, she's not in.
- She's in, I know it.

30
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,272
Then why don't she answer?

31
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,150
Knows it's me. She's just watching
the phone ring and not answering.

32
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:09,599
I can feel it.
She's trying to grind me down.

33
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,911
You're crazy, Joe.

34
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,790
You're out of your tiny Jersey mind.

35
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,398
80...

36
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,313
81...

37
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:59,508
Hey, it's Oetective Alka-Seltzer!
- Not today, okay, Ross.

38
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:07,277
Thanks, Ray. - Is it true
you used Tony's butt for cover?

39
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,039
Boy, there's a butt
I could use for cover.

40
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:16,228
Watch what you say about Gwen.
- About "Gwen"?

41
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,518
I'm sorry, Joe.
Are you and the lieutenant involved?

42
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:23,515
If I thought you were involved,
I never would have said a word.

43
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:28,118
Joe, Lieutenant wants to see you.
I think she's in a weird mood.

44
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,719
Lovers' tiff?

45
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,953
Morning!
- Sit down.

46
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,995
Know what I was just thinking about?

47
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:48,114
Remember Catalina? - Of course.
- Great weekend. - The best.

48
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:52,957
It was great because I was in love.
- Me too.

49
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:01,472
Remember what I said Sunday morning
when we were sitting on the terrace?

50
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,758
That you'd like me to nibble all...
- Not that.

51
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,878
I was the first man to...

52
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,749
The other stuff.

53
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,591
Oh, the feelings stuff.

54
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,388
Right.

55
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:18,396
Feelings and responsibilities stuff.
- Come on, Gwen.

56
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,076
If this is about the bust...
- I'm not talking about that fiasco.

57
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:26,632
You go out getting drunk,
while I stay up worrying!

58
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,678
You didn't call!

59
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,548
It was late.
Oidn't want to wake you.

60
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,229
Here, hold this.
- Why?

61
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,676
Pretend we're talking business.

62
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,514
Oon't want the precinct knowing.

63
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,229
I think they already know.
- What was I to think?

64
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,631
They said somebody got hit.

65
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:50,589
Then that Tony got hit
and you went to get more beer!

66
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,117
Honey, it's true.
I had a few drinks with the guys.

67
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,509
Yeah?
- Yeah.

68
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:00,432
That's funny, because Lou told me
you spent the evening on the phone.

69
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,715
So tell me,

70
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,351
who were you calling?
It sure wasn't me!

71
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,433
My mom.

72
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,599
Excuse me?

73
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,956
I was calling my mom.

74
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,878
You were calling your mom
at 2:30 in the morning.

75
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:25,158
That's the most pathetic excuse!
Tell me who she is.

76
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,074
She isn't anybody, she's my mom.

77
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:32,712
It doesn't really matter.
Could be your mom or a Oial-a-Bimbo.

78
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,716
It's over! - You don't mean that.
- I mean every word.

79
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,993
It's embarrassing me in my work.
You run away from responsibility.

80
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:45,951
I'll pack your... - I'm not going to
listen to this. - Where you going?

81
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,429
Fishing!

82
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,193
Get back in here!

83
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,353
Get back in this office, Bomowski!
That's an order.

84
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,600
Mom, I know you're there.

85
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,239
Come on!

86
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,830
Please God,
make her pick up.

87
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:10,350
Okay, that's it.
I've had it. I've really had it.

88
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,873
I'm a dead man.

89
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:40,710
This the New York flight?
- Yes, coming out right now.

90
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,231
Relax, kid, relax.

91
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,434
I think that's him. Yeah, it is.

92
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,910
Little Joey!

93
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,438
You must be Joe?
- Yes. Why?

94
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:11,033
I was a bed-wetter too.

95
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,031
It was so sweet!

96
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:18,069
He said, "Mommy,
my pee-pee got stuck in my zipper!"

97
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,750
Joey! There's my Joey!
There's my little boy.

98
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,957
Come here!

99
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,835
You've given up shaving.
- No, I shave.

100
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,231
Call that a shave?
- I shaved.

101
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,039
Oid you use a lawnmower?

102
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,671
What girl is going to marry you,

103
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,957
if you don't shave!
- Hi, Tutti!

104
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,639
This is little Joey?
- Looks a lot different in clothes.

105
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:52,033
We've got to be getting along now,
but thanks for showing us the photos.

106
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,876
You looked real sexy in diapers.

107
00:10:56,280 --> 00:11:00,592
Sally, if things don't work out
with the doctor, Joey's single!

108
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,709
I've always been a sucker
for a guy in Pampers!

109
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,359
What?

110
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:14,275
I can't get over you driving.
- I've been driving for 20 years!

111
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,990
You'll always be my little Joey.

112
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,830
Where were you the last few days?

113
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,518
At home in New Jersey. Where else?
- I must've called you 50 times.

114
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:32,356
That was you?
- Why didn't you answer?

115
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,111
For 5 years,
every time I'm about to visit,

116
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:39,796
you call and say it's a bad time.

117
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,078
This time I decided
I wouldn't answer the phone.

118
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,755
That's the most...
- Watch out!

119
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,516
Moron!
- Up yours, pal!

120
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:04,155
Sorry.
- Shall I drive? - No!

121
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,198
No, Mom.

122
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,431
I'm okay.

123
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,435
That was a close call, Pixie.

124
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,831
All cars near 4th and Main,

125
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:20,550
Please respond
to 486 South Main Street. Code 2.

126
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:29,916
What's going on? - Got a jumper
up there. Looks like he'll do it.

127
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,919
Oid the shrink show up?
- He's on his way.

128
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,753
Stay here.

129
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,310
Where are you going?
- Up there.

130
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,312
It's too dangerous. Listen.

131
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:52,359
I do this all the time.
I'm not bad at it.

132
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,877
I want you to stay here
and let me take care of this.

133
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,430
Be careful!
Oon't do anything foolish!

134
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:09,514
What seems to be the man's problem?
- He wants to talk to his mother.

135
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,911
They've been having problems.

136
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,034
Really?

137
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,149
I'll take care of this, officer.

138
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:36,355
Hey, how are you doing? Alright?
- Leave me alone. Oon't touch me!

139
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:39,354
Stay back, I'm gonna do it!
- I just want to talk to you.

140
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,671
Oon't tell me what to do!

141
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:45,629
Stay there, I'm going to do it!
- Hey you, young man!

142
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,156
Oown here! I'm not your mother,

143
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,757
but I am a mother
and you could talk to me,

144
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,914
if that's alright. - Officer,
this is serious. - Let her talk.

145
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,629
What do you want?

146
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,316
I just want you to know
the man next to you is my son.

147
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:05,679
We've had our difficulties.
- Mom, stay out of this, okay?

148
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:09,629
Joe, wave to the crowd.
- Mom. Goddamnit!

149
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,076
You don't swear to your mother.

150
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,677
Butt out, it's my mother.
- So do what she tells you.

151
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,310
Start waving or I'm jumping.

152
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,678
Start waving!
Start waving or I'm jumping!

153
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,153
I'm waving. See?
Mom, hi.

154
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:30,350
By the way, Joe's still single.
How do you like that?

155
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:33,433
He's a very nice boy.
A bit rough round the edge,

156
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:38,356
but nothing the right girl couldn't
smooth out. - Secure the megaphone.

157
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:43,231
We used to fight all the time.
He was very small for his age.

158
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:47,758
I was not! I was average height!
About your height. What's the deal?

159
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:52,153
Bet she's got pictures.
- I've got pictures, wait a minute.

160
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,791
She's got pictures.
- Mom, get rid of the pictures!

161
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,117
Isn't he adorable?

162
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:03,158
I thought I had things bad.
- Not close.

163
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,993
I'm ready to go in now.

164
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,550
Sorry for the inconvenience.
- Yeah.

165
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,831
That guy needs help.

166
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,597
Lesley Carnel, Channel 8 News.
We're downtown at 4th and Main,

167
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,514
where a man is on a ledge,

168
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,959
apparently despondent
about his mother. - Make her stop!

169
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,515
Are we here?

170
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,990
Is that your house?

171
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,873
What?

172
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:56,149
It's very, very nice.
- What's the matter. - Nothing.

173
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,073
You sniffed.

174
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,028
No, it's nothing. Only...

175
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,714
Only what?

176
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,111
Won't get a girl if you don't clean.

177
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:08,159
I clean this house every morning.
I clean and I clean.

178
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:12,712
It's not clean.
Filled with dust. Look at this!

179
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,351
You could grow things on it.

180
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:21,552
What's this? There's stuff under it.
Is that the closet?

181
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,192
No!
- What?

182
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:32,108
I've had a few problems
since my cleaning lady left.

183
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,875
Maybe she's lost in there.

184
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,278
Pineapple chunks?
- They're your favorite!

185
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,238
We've got them here too.

186
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:52,277
They don't taste the same.
- It's canned, exactly the same.

187
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:57,118
My son, the gourmet? Ha, ha.
Come on up, darling.

188
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:13,758
This is the way we clean the house,
clean the house, clean the house.

189
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,551
This is the way we clean the house,
early in the morning...

190
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,431
Oh God, make her stop!

191
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,398
Thank you, God.

192
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,197
I owe you.

193
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,038
What's this?

194
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,431
Oh, Joe's gun.

195
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,994
Look at this, all greasy and dirty.

196
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,231
Let's see...

197
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,590
There we go.
This and this...

198
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,718
Some of this...

199
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,832
Let's see... A little of that...

200
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,553
That's gonna be good!

201
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,913
Where do they keep the bullets?

202
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,232
Oh, not in there.

203
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,517
What's this little thing here?

204
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:31,914
Oh, goodness gracious.
Yes, that's where they are.

205
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,788
Okay, we'll wash those too.

206
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,915
This is the way we wash our gun,
wash our gun, wash our gun...

207
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:49,675
This is the way we wash our gun,
early in the morning.

208
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,992
Going to clean that out
really well. That's fine.

209
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,115
Go ahead, make your bed!

210
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,797
What did you do to my gun?
- Nothing, I cleaned it.

211
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,077
You ruined it!

212
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,913
You took all the bluing off!

213
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:20,517
Chlorox? Great!
It's going to blow up in my hand now.

214
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,831
Try to do something helpful...

215
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,832
Nice and original.

216
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,873
You get barked at! Come on, Pix!

217
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:34,513
Mom, I'm sorry. It's an old gun.
I don't use it any more.

218
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,313
Breakfast!
- Mom!

219
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:48,430
Nothing I haven't seen before.
- Would you turn around please?

220
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,429
Both of you!

221
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,869
God.

222
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:58,029
Pixie and I thought we'd pop
into the station, see where you work.

223
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,919
Oid you cut yourself?

224
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:04,949
No!
- Need some iodine? - No!

225
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,351
A Band-Aid? - No!
The station is out of the question.

226
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,193
Absolutely unequivocally.

227
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,876
We'll talk over breakfast.
- I'm serious.

228
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,989
What did I always tell you?
Breakfast is the most important meal.

229
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:23,996
Start on these, and I'll scramble
some eggs. - I don't like eggs.

230
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,234
If you don't eat them for breakfast,
they'll be waiting for you at dinner.

231
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,512
Bye, sweetie, have a nice day.
Oh, Joey...

232
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,434
You forgot your lunch!

233
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:59,235
We're not off
to a very good start, are we, Pixie?

234
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,517
Know what we should do?

235
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:05,390
We should get
Joey something a little special.

236
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,833
Let's see...

237
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,188
You want to get out here?

238
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,909
I mean, look at this place...

239
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,356
Ridiculous! I'm from Newark.

240
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,198
If you want stopping power,
this is your baby.

241
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,592
Charter Arms, .44, Bulldog.

242
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,072
No, my son's is bigger.
I got a bottle brush down the barrel.

243
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,198
You put a brush down the barrel?

244
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,110
Yeah, I wanted to clean out...
Never mind.

245
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,671
Okay, bigger. How about this?

246
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,069
That's it!

247
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,473
Taurus, PT, .99, long barrel.
Punch a hole through a Pontiac.

248
00:21:54,880 --> 00:22:00,113
How much? - $450. - $450?
- The Bulldog is only $325.

249
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:05,631
No, I want the big one.
Oon't suppose you gift-wrap? - No.

250
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,838
I'll take it like that.
- There's a cooling-off period.

251
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:12,516
Give me your driver's license.
I'll do the paperwork.

252
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:15,593
In 2 weeks it's yours.
- I need it today!

253
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,594
Sorry, that's the law.

254
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,958
Can I have it back?

255
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,519
Come on, Pixie.

256
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,594
Hey, lady!

257
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,670
You want to buy a gun today?

258
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,150
You got a gun for sale?

259
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,678
You do?
- Step into my office.

260
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:49,594
Lightweight, adjustable stock.
- No!

261
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,275
I want a Taurus.99 long barrel.

262
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,352
Your son will love this.

263
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:58,389
What'll he do with that? He carries
his gun under his jacket. - Wait!

264
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,950
Wait a minute. Here, here.

265
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:05,232
What about one of these?
You've seen Miami Vice.

266
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:10,112
This is a Mac 10.
All the big dealers love this gun.

267
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,636
I don't think that's exactly my Joey.

268
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,713
That's a full automatic. That means

269
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:20,113
30 shots in 2.5 seconds.
You can cut down trees with it.

270
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,590
How much?
- $500.

271
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,749
$350.

272
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,191
They're there.
- Great.

273
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,239
Bless you.
- I'm coming down with something.

274
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,552
You've got allergies.
- I've got a fever.

275
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,678
The Santa Anna wind's very heavy.

276
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,116
What do you know about it!

277
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:00,671
Yeah? - Mr. Parnell, we've located
the misappropriated merchandise.

278
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,877
If you're certain it's ours...

279
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:06,153
then repossess it.
- Yes, sir.

280
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:10,109
Bless you. - Let's go?
- To work! - Let's go.

281
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:16,038
Oo you want to sell me the gun,
or sit dreaming about $500?

282
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,639
Okay. Oon't forget that extra clip.

283
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,992
Nice doing business with you.

284
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,311
Come on, Pixie!

285
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,671
He's going round the front.

286
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,509
Oamn!

287
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,679
Morning!

288
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,070
There you go.
- Thanks.

289
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,472
Hangover?

290
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,398
Heartburn.

291
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,951
What did you eat for breakfast?

292
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,314
Juice, fruit, milk,

293
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:26,473
eggs, bacon and sausage,

294
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,348
hash browns,

295
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,993
toast, pancakes,

296
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,829
honey rolls,

297
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,073
Cocoa Puffs. There's more.

298
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:45,951
You must've been starving.
- I wasn't hungry.

299
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:50,594
My mother's visiting.

300
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:55,195
Well, when your mamma cooks,
she cooks.

301
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,315
Mind you...

302
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,749
breakfast is supposed
to be the most important meal.

303
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,752
Thank you, Tony.

304
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,754
Have a nice day.
- Hey, Joe. - Yeah?

305
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,116
Thank God you've arrived.
- Why?

306
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,796
Your mom's here.
- My mom? - Yes.

307
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,958
Chicken pox?

308
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,032
Looks very good in spots.

309
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:29,000
Told everybody it was freckles.

310
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:35,672
Mom, are you okay?
- Fine. These things happen.

311
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:39,072
What things? - She witnessed
a murder. - A murder?

312
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:42,472
Yeah, downtown.
- What were you doing downtown?

313
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,917
Shopping. Just relax. Have a cookie.
- Shut up!

314
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:51,279
Maybe I should get the lieutenant...
- What's going on?

315
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,398
Nothing.
- I'm a witness.

316
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,518
Who is this?
- I'll introduce you.

317
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:59,629
Ross, you better shut up, I mean it.
- This is Tutti, Joey's mom.

318
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,428
Joey's mom?
- That's right, Gwen.

319
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,798
My mom.
As you can see,

320
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,953
it's been a shock for her,
so I'm taking her home.

321
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:14,592
Mrs. Bomowski is one of my
principle witnesses. - Your witness?

322
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:20,120
It's my case. Your mom's happy
to stay to the end of the month.

323
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,475
You said what?

324
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:26,750
You are so beautiful, Gwen.
That lovely hair and that smile.

325
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:30,232
Joey, if you'd worn your retainers,
you could've had teeth like that.

326
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,995
Say goodbye, we're going home.
- Not so fast.

327
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,391
I want to interview the witness.

328
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:40,195
What are you trying to do? - To you?
- This is just ridiculous!

329
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,431
It's ridiculous
your mother witnessed a murder?

330
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,752
No, Ross sticking his head into it.

331
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:49,550
I can't transfer it to you.
- He's told her to stay in town.

332
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:54,112
She's supposed to go back Monday.
- That was before the killing.

333
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:59,355
Can't we fly her back? If she stays
past Monday, I'll kill her myself.

334
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:03,639
What's wrong with you?
She seems wonderful. Warm, caring...

335
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:07,191
Obviously crazy about you.
- Crazy is right.

336
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:11,070
She talks to total strangers
about my diaper rash!

337
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:14,438
She loves you, Joe.
- Her love is driving me nuts!

338
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,876
Either way, she's staying.

339
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:24,388
Joe, come on. How bad can it be?

340
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:27,633
Two, three weeks tops.

341
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,156
This is about us, right?

342
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,869
This is about revenge?

343
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:42,517
Are you suggesting
I would use my rank? - Yes!

344
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:45,753
Oon't let the door hit you
on your way out, Oetective.

345
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,990
You can call me Lieutenant.

346
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:00,438
Oon't be so gloomy! Think of all
the time we'll spend together.

347
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,079
Oon't you want to hear my plan?

348
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,755
I want to brush my teeth
and go to bed.

349
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,071
You and I can crack this case.

350
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,074
When we find the killer,
you'll probably be promoted.

351
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,516
And things will work out with Gwen.

352
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,513
Goodnight.

353
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,670
I didn't tell Ross what I really saw.

354
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:39,071
I held it all back for you.

355
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,837
You're joking, right, Mom?
- No, it's not a joke.

356
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,834
You can't fool around with homicide.

357
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:51,310
You need this to get promoted.

358
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:55,554
I don't want a promotion.
- You're only a sergeant. - I like it.

359
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:58,155
Next you'll tell me
you like where you live.

360
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:01,518
I do. Mom, I'm happy.
I don't want to get promoted.

361
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:05,310
I don't want to get married.
I like my life.

362
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:09,599
I can wear my underwear more than
once, leave the toilet seat up...

363
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,709
Watch what I want on TV.
Mom, I like my life!

364
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:16,839
You call this a life?

365
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,879
Goodnight, Mom.

366
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,356
Back off, back off!

367
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,319
I'm going in.
- He has an automatic.

368
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,597
Joe, are you crazy?

369
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,231
Mom, what are you doing here?

370
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,392
Mommy's got to change you.

371
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,671
I don't want to be changed.

372
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,391
I've got to change you.
- I can change you.

373
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,079
Stop trying to change me!

374
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,556
Joey, are you alright?
- I'm fine.

375
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:50,590
Sounded like you were having
a bad dream. - No, I'm fine, really.

376
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,798
I should tuck you in.
- Oon't, Mom.

377
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:57,397
Let me tuck you in.
- I don't wanna be tucked in.

378
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,196
Joey, let me tuck you in.

379
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:04,273
You just snuggle down.
- I don't wanna snuggle.

380
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:07,069
You were just having a bad dream.

381
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:13,634
Remember when you were little
and I used to sing to you.

382
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:16,679
Oh, God!
- Aw, shush.

383
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:21,392
See if we can remember how that goes.
- Mom, please don't.

384
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:30,038
Lullaby and goodnight,
thy mother's delight.

385
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:35,992
With down overspread,
here's baby's wee bed.

386
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,960
Lullaby and goodnight,

387
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:42,477
lay thee down now and rest.

388
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,833
Lullaby and goodnight,

389
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:50,597
may thy slumber be best.

390
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,198
Goodnight, Joey.

391
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,153
Morning, Mom.

392
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:14,588
Better get going or we'll be late.
- I didn't want to wake you.

393
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:20,997
Better get you to the station
for your 9:30 appointment with Ross.

394
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,590
I'm not saying anything.
- I won't argue.

395
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:29,313
If he arrests you for withholding
evidence, that's your problem.

396
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,595
Suppose you don't want your present?

397
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,508
Present?
- Just a little something...

398
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,349
A present?

399
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,797
You don't deserve it.
- Come on, Mom. Please.

400
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,799
I love presents.

401
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,918
It's heavy.

402
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,435
Jesus!

403
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:05,674
Is it the wrong kind? - Wrong kind?
It's illegal. Where did you get it?

404
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:08,355
From those guys who got shot.

405
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,512
A machine gun off the back of a van?

406
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,229
In the store
they said I had to "cool off."

407
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:16,074
Why didn't you tell me?

408
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,589
I wanted it to be a surprise.

409
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,797
It is!

410
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,708
You're saying it was a big car?

411
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:29,313
Oon't know
if I'd call it big exactly.

412
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,676
So it was a small car.

413
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:36,232
Oifficult to say. To me it was big.
To you it might have been small.

414
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,475
Like a Cadillac?
- Which model?

415
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,108
Any model!

416
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,715
A few years ago...

417
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:48,317
there was a small one.
- Was it like the Cimarron?

418
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,199
No.

419
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,591
Oefinitely not like the Cimarron.

420
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,837
Let's take a break.

421
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,870
You're tired.
Are you eating right?

422
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:05,317
I could bring you
some lentil soup. - Be right back.

423
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,630
So far, so good, Pixie.

424
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,998
Gwen, do you have a minute?
- Sure.

425
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:21,318
Jesus! That's a full automatic.
- I know.

426
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:25,633
And your mother... Okay, Joe.
I'll trace the gun. - Thanks.

427
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:29,671
No telling what she'll come home with.
- I know.

428
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,196
I really appreciate it.
If you don't mind?

429
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:36,036
Try not to kill anyone with it.
- She's too little. Wouldn't hit her.

430
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:41,995
Who's the little boy by the pool?
- Joey, only 9 and all those muscles!

431
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,392
You can already see
he's going to have nice equipment.

432
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:50,349
Oon't be embarrassed.
I'm old, but I'm still a woman.

433
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:53,877
Tell me, do you love my Joey?

434
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:58,479
I don't know.
I did love him. Maybe I still do.

435
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,030
He loves you.
- He never shows it.

436
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:04,989
That's Joey.
Ooesn't mean he doesn't love you.

437
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:08,551
If he'd just show me how he feels!

438
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,997
A box of candy,
a bunch of flowers...

439
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:16,109
He never sent you flowers?
- Never. - Oh, Joe...

440
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:19,080
And me being a lieutenant
just makes things worse.

441
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,392
Oid you see this one?

442
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,758
Very serious looking.
How old is he there?

443
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:28,630
13. This was taken
just after his father died.

444
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:32,675
I went to pieces,
no good for anything for days.

445
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,911
Joey did everything.

446
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:38,596
He arranged the funeral,
called the family...

447
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,751
picked out the casket...

448
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,310
talked to the priest...

449
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,711
But he never cried.

450
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,477
I know Joe loved his father.

451
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:53,873
But to this day
I don't know if he ever cried.

452
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:09,158
You were talking about something.
- It was nothing.

453
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:13,348
You were both crying!
- Girl talk. You wouldn't understand.

454
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,320
You have a gift for starting trouble.

455
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:20,554
Oon't interfere with Gwen and me.
- Well, somebody has to.

456
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,679
She's a lovely girl,
and you never send her flowers.

457
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,432
I'll get the door.

458
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:32,877
Mom, this is the point of no return!

459
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,190
I've had it.

460
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:37,592
I've completely had it.
I'm taking you to the apartment,

461
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,710
I'm going to handcuff you to a sink,
and put you on the first plane home.

462
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:45,395
Here you are. Let's go.

463
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:59,797
Ask me what I saw!
- I don't want to know.

464
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,191
Ask me.
- No!

465
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,119
Ask me what I saw.

466
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,909
You're an old lady from Newark.

467
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:11,756
You knit, make jam,
talk on the phone. That's it!

468
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,433
What did you see?

469
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:19,988
The man who sold me the gun.
The one that got away. And his van.

470
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,516
Really? Was he little? Big?

471
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:26,117
Big, 6' 3", 320 lbs.

472
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:30,832
He had a tattoo of a coiled snake
with "God Rides a Harley" above it.

473
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:36,314
Will you remember this?
A Chevy van, gun-metal gray, an '82.

474
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,631
The year with the longer wheelbase.

475
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,234
License plate:

476
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,949
JL2-661.

477
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,396
This is 90W2,
give me 90W90.

478
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,193
Go ahead, 90W2.

479
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:58,197
Could you find Tony and tell him
I need another favor. - 10-4.

480
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:03,152
Where's your boyfriend and the guns?
- What are you talking about?

481
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:06,233
I hardly know the guy.

482
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,995
Paulie, nothing down there.

483
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:13,996
Check the garage. - I did,
there's nothing. - Well, check there.

484
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:26,078
Is this the house?
- That's where the van's registered.

485
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:29,950
Shall I cover the back?
- We're not partners!

486
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,679
Okay, okay.

487
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:38,431
We're not connecting here, honey.

488
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,192
Keep her quiet!

489
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,635
Wrong house?

490
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,318
Help me! Help me!

491
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,555
Come on.

492
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,514
Oh gosh, no!

493
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:01,989
Okay?
- Yeah.

494
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,472
Joey, are you alright?

495
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:09,749
Oon't jump!

496
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:45,989
Get in, sweetie!
We're gonna nail those turkeys!

497
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,678
Okay, Ma. Make a right!
- Okay. - That's good.

498
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,192
Sorry.
- It was an accident.

499
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,950
Jump!
Use the road!

500
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:29,795
Watch it!

501
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,192
Way to go, Mom!

502
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:39,713
Floor it!

503
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:42,315
They're going left.
- Slow down.

504
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,793
Left! Slow it down!

505
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:46,595
Be careful!

506
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:55,397
There's nothing in there.
I already looked.

507
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:01,189
What's in the file?
It's the trace on the gun, isn't it?

508
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:05,115
What does it say, Joe?
- I haven't read it.

509
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,954
I'm giving it to Ross.

510
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:10,430
I don't believe this.
- Believe it!

511
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:13,718
Look who it is.
Norman Bates and his mom!

512
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:16,156
Cut it out!
- You're going to tell him?

513
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,432
My mother lied.

514
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:23,038
She got the license plate
and I traced the address.

515
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,954
Shit!
- Watch your mouth.

516
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:31,275
That's rich coming from the most
pathetic cop ever in this precinct.

517
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:35,395
Is there anything else...

518
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:38,030
I should know?
- Yes, Oetective.

519
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,949
We think you're an asshole.

520
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:47,757
Take a walk with me.

521
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,950
Think I'm going to take that?

522
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:59,954
She's just an old lady.

523
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:04,399
A monster, that's what she is.
And her cookies suck!

524
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,394
Watch what you say!
- I'm not watching anything!

525
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:10,633
If you even look at this case...

526
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:13,235
I'll throw your mom in a county can

527
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:17,792
before you can say "Golden Ager"!
- Are you threatening my mother?

528
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:19,349
You, your mom...

529
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:22,320
Your whole goodamn family.

530
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:26,076
Ross, you just made
a big mistake. - Oh, sure.

531
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:27,835
What are you doing?

532
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,353
Jesus Christ!

533
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:41,712
Hi.
- Hi.

534
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:47,238
You forgot to dry your hands.
- Ross needs the towels more than me.

535
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:51,519
Ross needs the towels?
- Long story. - Oh, excuse me.

536
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:57,598
I have your toothbrush.
- My toothbrush?

537
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,194
Yeah.

538
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:03,876
With the frog's head.
I forgot to pack it.

539
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:06,068
Thanks.

540
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:10,599
Lieutenant!

541
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:15,118
I want to file a complaint
against him and his mom...

542
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:17,795
for assault
and withholding information.

543
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:21,670
What, Ross?
Nothing, just flushing him out.

544
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:24,719
I'm gonna see you suspended.

545
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:29,439
Ross! - What?
- Get back to your desk.

546
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:32,559
Oh, Lieutenant...
- Now! Please.

547
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:47,315
It's a man thing.
I'd better get back to my desk too.

548
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:51,596
Oh, Gwen. Thanks for the brush.

549
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:58,869
The gun was part of a shipment...

550
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:01,840
that wound up downtown.

551
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:06,358
The warehouse burnt down and
the watchman was killed in the fire.

552
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:09,638
Big explosion of ammunition.

553
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:13,396
Guns destroyed,
cause of the fire never established.

554
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:18,999
Company goes broke.
Insurance pays 12 million.

555
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:21,674
Are you listening?

556
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:26,312
Like Mr. Krueger. He burnt his
luncheonette down for the insurance.

557
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:29,837
They found the silver at home.
- Same thing here.

558
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,470
Your gun didn't get burned.

559
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:38,477
Mama knows! When we get home,
I'm gonna make you a fresh hamburger.

560
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:44,549
She doesn't like fast food.
- It's not that. - What?

561
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:48,430
Ross' face when you said,
we think you're an asshole.

562
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:50,671
I gave it to him good.

563
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:55,631
Blew him away. - His ass was grass,
and I was the lawnmower.

564
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:00,948
You're really something, Mom.

565
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:10,435
I'm going to go up
and talk to these guys. Be right back.

566
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:18,635
We could do "good cop, bad cop"!
- I can handle it. Thanks.

567
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:24,876
Oo you really want to go?
- You know I do. - Okay.

568
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:27,953
Go downstairs and sniff around.

569
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:31,193
I'll be upstairs with the big boys.

570
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:34,111
It's that cop.

571
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:37,990
Get in the side office
till he's gone. Move it!

572
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:42,553
Yeah, show the officer in.

573
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:47,990
Oetective Joseph Bomuwski.
- Bomowski. - Good afternoon.

574
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:49,628
What can I do for you?

575
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:55,637
I'm investigating a warehouse fire,
a lot of weapons were destroyed.

576
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:58,349
You collected the insurance.
- Yes.

577
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:02,355
I hope there isn't any problem.
- What would say if we had evidence

578
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:05,399
that the weapons
weren't destroyed in the fire.

579
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:09,716
That we were the victim of a fraud.

580
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:14,399
You don't look like a victim,
you look more like a beneficiary.

581
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:20,469
Excuse me.

582
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:28,794
A woman out there
is claiming to be your mother. - No!

583
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:33,512
Sorry. - That's alright.
- They tried... - I'll handle this.

584
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:36,309
I say we work them over!
- Just wait outside.

585
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:38,676
It's almost under control.
- Joe...

586
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:44,234
they're being audited.
I know an audit when I see one.

587
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:48,519
Mom, later!
- It's the motive.

588
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:50,319
Gesundheit!

589
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:55,593
Lot of accusations flying around.

590
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,638
What do you want?

591
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:01,350
To look at the warehouse.
Any problem with that?

592
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:04,320
Oo you have a warrant?

593
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:06,517
Or your mother?
- No.

594
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:08,592
But I've a good mind...

595
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,549
to give you
a spanking you won't forget.

596
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:19,431
Oo I go to the warehouse
or do I get a warrant?

597
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:27,758
Give the detective
the address of the warehouse...

598
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:32,073
where we had that fire,
with the keys and whatever else.

599
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:38,393
Thanks for your time. Mom, let's go!

600
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:41,360
For now you can keep your pants on.

601
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:43,637
But just remember:

602
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:47,032
I'll be back!
What? Oid I embarrass you?

603
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:49,237
Yeah, "I'll be back"!

604
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:53,838
I heard a cop say that.
- Terminators say that, not cops.

605
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:55,548
Get out here!

606
00:49:55,960 --> 00:50:00,750
You idiots! Not only do you
let ten cases of guns get stolen

607
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:03,549
and screw up their return.
I've now got...

608
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:07,396
some cop's weird mother
threatening to spank me!

609
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:11,554
We'll take care of them. They won't
bother you. - They'd better not.

610
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:16,076
I'll get the plane tomorrow.
All you've got to do is make sure...

611
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,789
everyone keeps quiet for 24 hours.

612
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:21,873
Make it look like an accident.

613
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:38,471
Oon't like the look of this.
It's dangerous, don't go.

614
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:40,598
It's not dangerous.

615
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,833
So I can go too?
- Oh no.

616
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:46,117
We're working so well together.

617
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:50,752
Right, and working well together
means looking out for each other.

618
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:52,639
What are you doing?

619
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:57,913
Answer me! What are you doing?
- What does it look like?

620
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:02,837
Looks like you're locking me in.
- Got my detective skills from you.

621
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:43,039
That's not gonna work.

622
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:51,670
Let's put that in here.

623
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:54,709
How does this thing go?

624
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:02,750
Hello, hello.

625
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:06,711
This is a police radio band.
Please identify yourself.

626
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:09,236
Tutti Bomowski, Joe's mom.

627
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:15,237
Hi, Mrs. Bomowski, this is John.
Thanks for the cookies. What's up?

628
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:21,274
I'm so embarrassed.

629
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:26,470
Somehow I managed to lock
myself in Joe's car. Is that silly?

630
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:28,677
No problem, Mrs. Bomowski.

631
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:33,392
You're going to look for a Slim Jim,
a long, thin piece of metal.

632
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:00,835
Shoot!

633
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:05,552
Jesus! - I don't want to live
in a world where my son locks me in.

634
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:12,555
Enough bullets in that gun?
- Quiet!

635
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:15,076
Because if you don't, I do.

636
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:19,553
Where did you get that?
- From your messy glove comparment.

637
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:21,598
Give it me.
- No.

638
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:24,958
Give it to me.
- No.

639
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:26,995
Mom, down!

640
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,228
Jump!

641
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,756
Is Pixie okay?
- She's okay.

642
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:58,394
Shit!

643
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:05,189
What are you going to do?

644
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:11,111
- Take the dog.

645
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:14,592
Get over there. - Where?
- Against the wall. - Okay.

646
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:17,394
Get back!

647
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:31,990
Stop! Police!

648
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:41,591
Get down!
- They're getting away!

649
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:43,749
Stop!

650
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:46,793
Or my mom will shoot!

651
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:56,198
A little high,
but not bad for a beginner.

652
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:02,714
Paulie! Start it up fast!

653
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:11,192
Turn around.
- I'm not going nowhere.

654
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:14,592
Take it easy!
- Great collar, Joe.

655
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:18,879
Think you could mess with my boy?

656
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:21,793
Gesundheit.

657
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:30,198
Ousty here.

658
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:32,352
Put it in that chair.

659
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:35,797
Alright, file this.
- I want to see a lawyer.

660
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:38,395
And a doctor.
- You're spreading germs.

661
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:42,679
Tell Ross me and my mother
cracked his case wide open.

662
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:45,719
Before you say anything...

663
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:57,432
What was that?

664
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:02,118
I'm just happy you've unlocked
those hidden feelings. - Feelings?

665
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:06,798
What do you mean? - The flowers.
I've never seen so many roses.

666
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:12,358
I don't believe it.
- What?

667
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:16,673
She's always got to interfere.
Orives me crazy! - What?

668
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:20,152
It was my mom.

669
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:25,389
You mean you didn't send the roses?

670
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:28,234
Of course I didn't.

671
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:31,073
I didn't mean it...

672
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:40,951
Mom, get your
senior citizen's butt in here!

673
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:42,555
What?

674
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:44,598
Oon't say a word!

675
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,912
Something about Gwen?
- I want to talk to you!

676
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:51,790
No need to shout.
- This is my house.

677
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:56,318
I know this is hard for you,
but I've drawn up a list of rules.

678
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:58,517
I don't like the tone of your voice.

679
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:02,390
Rule no. 1: Never say
you don't like the tone of my voice!

680
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:03,994
Rule no. 2...

681
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:07,910
You've written a list?
- Yes, and don't interrupt.

682
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:09,396
No. 2:

683
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:12,553
Oon't interfere with my love life.

684
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:15,679
She didn't like the flowers?
- They were a big hit!

685
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:19,395
3: Oon't clean!
4: Oon't iron my underwear!

686
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:23,509
5: Never tell anyone the embarrassing
things from when I was a kid!

687
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:27,310
Just a minute...
- This is non-negotiable.

688
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:31,957
6: Oon't clean, buy, or shoot guns!

689
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:36,148
7: Here's a public
safety message: No driving!

690
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:41,308
8: Never say breakfast is
the most important meal. And 9:

691
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:44,757
The photos stay in New Jersey.

692
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:46,639
Anything else?

693
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:51,431
10: Sometimes forget I'm your son
and treat me like a human being.

694
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:57,399
You can't treat me like this.
- Yes, I can. Think about it.

695
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,993
You think making me follow
these rules will improve your life?

696
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:16,236
I'm not listening.
- I'll tell you what your problem is.

697
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:21,998
Rule no. 11: Oon't tell me
what my problem is. I know what it is.

698
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:24,595
An old lady with a dog.

699
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:28,993
You don't love enough. If someone
gets close, you shut them out.

700
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:31,231
Like me and Gwen.
- You see this?

701
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:33,870
She turned into Or. Ruth!

702
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:36,714
It scares you that Gwen loves you.

703
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:41,477
When you meet someone special,
you should grab hold of them.

704
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:44,155
What are you talking about?
- About waking up...

705
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:46,994
and finding you're 60 years old...

706
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:50,472
in a little apartment
all by yourself, wishing you had...

707
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:52,552
someone as special as Gwen.

708
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:56,957
She's right.
- She's really upset.

709
00:58:57,360 --> 00:58:58,793
Finished?

710
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:06,349
For your information:
I didn't dump Gwen, she dumped me.

711
00:59:56,040 --> 00:59:58,156
Gwen, I just...

712
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:02,714
I just called to say you're special.

713
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:05,588
Oh Christ, that's ridiculous.

714
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:08,272
I just called...

715
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:12,358
to say that you're so special.

716
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:17,589
And when you meet
someone special, you should...

717
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,195
grab hold.

718
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:22,996
You should grab hold of them.

719
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:24,671
Oh, come on!

720
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:26,911
Just do it right.

721
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:31,233
When you meet someone special,
you should grab hold of them. - Joe?

722
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:36,629
What are you doing here so late?

723
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:41,599
Just catching up on paperwork.

724
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:45,388
I had to pick some stuff up.

725
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:50,071
Want to catch up on paperwork, too?

726
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:52,470
Sure.

727
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:58,196
To paperwork.

728
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:07,599
Look...

729
01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:10,591
I'm sorry that I hit you.

730
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:14,470
I was just
disappointed about the flowers.

731
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:17,872
I deserved to get hit.
I made a mess of everything.

732
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:22,239
I wish I'd sent you the flowers.

733
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:23,709
Really?

734
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:33,358
You're so special.

735
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:38,195
When you meet
someone as special as you,

736
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:40,591
you should grab them.

737
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:47,675
Otherwise, one morning
you'll wake up and you're 60,

738
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:51,117
living alone in a little apartment.

739
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:53,636
And you wish...

740
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:57,830
you had the chance
to love someone as special as you.

741
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:03,953
That's the sweetest thing
anyone's said to me.

742
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:19,950
My mother said it, Gwen.

743
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:25,638
Your mother? - She was right.
Jesus, it kills me.

744
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:29,558
Ooes this kill you?

745
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:57,639
Hey, boss. What's happening?
- There you are.

746
01:02:58,040 --> 01:03:00,474
Take a look at this note.

747
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,639
"I regret my life of crime.

748
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:09,793
I can't live anymore. J. Parnell."

749
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:12,270
Well, what do you think?

750
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:16,919
You've been under pressure lately.

751
01:03:17,320 --> 01:03:19,880
You might be overreacting.

752
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:22,999
We've got the weapons,
we're going to South America,

753
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:26,949
and claiming lots of money.
Why are you so depressed?

754
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:29,954
I'm not going to kill myself.

755
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:32,598
It's part of the plan.

756
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:37,437
They read the note, we disappear.
Then they don't come looking for us.

757
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:40,474
Good idea.

758
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:43,394
No, no. That's a great idea.

759
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:46,268
There's one for you too. You sign that

760
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:48,591
and we can get out of here.

761
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:52,993
Make sure you sign it clearly.

762
01:03:55,240 --> 01:03:57,754
Let me take a look at that.

763
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:08,679
Very nice.

764
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:17,992
That hurts.

765
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:46,312
"Oear Joe. I'm sorry. I can't
help myself. I love you too much.

766
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:49,917
I've left to be
out of your way. Love, Mom. PS:

767
01:04:50,360 --> 01:04:53,591
About the flowers.
I've ruined it for you and Gwen.

768
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:57,356
Maybe one day
you can forgive me. PPS:

769
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:00,752
There's a pineapple
upside-down cake in the icebox."

770
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:02,195
Oamn!

771
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:12,152
Hey!
- Sorry!

772
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:21,389
Excuse me!

773
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:54,678
Wait!
- Hey, slow down.

774
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:57,709
You alright?

775
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:00,355
Mom, stop!

776
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:04,953
No, Joe,
you got to live your own life.

777
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:08,079
You were right.
I don't want you to go.

778
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:11,995
Slow down. - You were right
about grabbing onto Gwen.

779
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:13,833
I was wrong.

780
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:16,549
When I told her,
it changed everything.

781
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:21,230
It did?
- Yes. Mom, I want you to stay.

782
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:23,835
Quick, stop the cart!

783
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:31,833
Really?

784
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:34,833
You know I do.

785
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:42,271
Now tell me.

786
01:06:42,680 --> 01:06:45,035
What did Gwen say when you told her?

787
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:48,591
That it's the sweetest thing
anyone ever said to her.

788
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:52,117
And then?
- That's what she said.

789
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:56,718
You didn't propose to her?
- No, but I mean it's a beginning.

790
01:06:57,120 --> 01:07:00,908
It's a missed opportunity.
- Wait. Wait.

791
01:07:01,320 --> 01:07:04,153
Stop right there.
- What?

792
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:07,351
You're doing it again.
- What?

793
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:10,671
Interfering. Rule no. 2.

794
01:07:11,080 --> 01:07:13,674
You can't be serious about the rules?

795
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:19,433
Gate 18, fast!
Oon't want her to miss her flight.

796
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:21,558
What are you doing?

797
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:25,396
Have a nice ride home.
- What are you doing?

798
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,513
Thank you. Joey!

799
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:32,998
Joseph A. Bomowski,
this is your mother talking.

800
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:38,149
Wait a minute!
Can't we discuss these rules?

801
01:07:38,560 --> 01:07:42,758
They're non-negotiable.
- What about a little flexibility?

802
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:47,870
Flexibility? Give you an inch,
you take the entire turnpike. - Okay.

803
01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:49,998
Okay what?

804
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:52,318
The rules.

805
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:54,073
You got a deal.

806
01:07:56,800 --> 01:07:58,552
You got a deal.

807
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:11,956
It'll be the best weekend
we ever spent together. - Maybe not.

808
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:19,515
Stay here.

809
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:07,915
Got him! - I told you
to wait outside. - Yeah, yeah.

810
01:09:08,320 --> 01:09:10,880
You promised to leave me alone.

811
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:13,032
So, I'll start tomorrow.

812
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:15,078
I give up.

813
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:20,994
Holy moley!
That's the guy who sold me the gun.

814
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:23,231
It is?
- Yeah.

815
01:09:24,720 --> 01:09:28,269
More chocolate, Mitchell?
- No thanks, Mrs. Bomowski.

816
01:09:28,680 --> 01:09:30,557
You, sweetie?
- No, I'm fine.

817
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:34,316
Why'd you come here?
It's not even my case.

818
01:09:34,720 --> 01:09:36,870
To save my girlfriend's life.

819
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:41,633
My house ain't safe.
My brother's dead.

820
01:09:42,040 --> 01:09:43,393
I got nowhere to go.

821
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:45,995
Any idea who these people are?

822
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:52,271
We stole a few cases of shooters
but there were thousands of them.

823
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:57,278
The ones supposed to have
been destroyed. We got them. - Where?

824
01:09:57,680 --> 01:10:01,389
Brunswick airstrip.
Outside of Ventura. It went bankrupt.

825
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:06,476
A savings and loan took it over.
- Great. Joe and I'll check it out.

826
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:12,278
Remember when I was in school,
every week you would call my teachers

827
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:14,989
to see if I was doing good
and cutting class.

828
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:17,630
Embarrassed the hell out of me.

829
01:10:18,040 --> 01:10:21,077
It wasn't you didn't trust me...

830
01:10:21,480 --> 01:10:23,038
you just wanted to make sure...

831
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:26,352
I didn't get into trouble.

832
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:30,077
You finally understand.
- I do understand.

833
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:34,716
And I want you
to understand why I have to do...

834
01:10:36,280 --> 01:10:37,395
this!

835
01:10:40,280 --> 01:10:41,349
Whoa, bummer!

836
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:51,231
I once did this before
when Joey was 9.

837
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:55,798
He got his head caught in a railing.
The problem was his ears.

838
01:10:56,480 --> 01:11:00,951
They were so big for his age.
They kept getting caught on the bars.

839
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:04,519
I got it. I did it.

840
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:09,033
I'm out! I did it!
- Yo, Mrs. B! Way to go, babe!

841
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:11,829
Sometimes I impress myself.

842
01:11:12,240 --> 01:11:13,992
Could you help me off?

843
01:11:15,640 --> 01:11:19,349
Where's my gun? I'm outta here.
- With your keys in the bathroom.

844
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:21,079
Thanks, babe.

845
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:39,908
Major bummer.

846
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:45,437
Sorry, Mitchell.
I need your car.

847
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:49,435
And I don't think
Joey wants you going off to Mexico.

848
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:53,196
Hold still. This won't hurt a bit.

849
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,389
Be back to get you, babe.

850
01:12:30,280 --> 01:12:31,269
Get back.

851
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:59,157
Sergeant Bomowski. I need assistance
at Brunkswick airstrip, right away.

852
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:31,679
Let me go!
- Hurry up.

853
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:39,553
Move it. Come on.

854
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:43,552
Where's your little boy?

855
01:13:43,960 --> 01:13:46,997
You won't get away with this.
My Joe will be all over you.

856
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:50,472
Get her on the plane,
so her son can't interfere.

857
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:54,475
When we get her over the ocean,
we'll see how well she can swim.

858
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:57,030
Move it! Move it!

859
01:14:03,640 --> 01:14:04,629
Sit down.

860
01:14:57,120 --> 01:14:58,439
Shit!

861
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:15,233
Get out there and find him.

862
01:16:16,680 --> 01:16:19,069
Get off. Take her down.

863
01:16:19,480 --> 01:16:20,993
Oh God!

864
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:25,231
Where are you taking me?

865
01:16:25,640 --> 01:16:27,631
Shut up!
- Joey!

866
01:16:39,200 --> 01:16:41,475
There you are. Orop it!

867
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:46,830
You okay?
- Why are you here?

868
01:16:47,240 --> 01:16:49,595
I came to back you up.
- Get him inside!

869
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:52,914
Let her go.

870
01:16:53,320 --> 01:16:56,630
Oo you think
I'd be content with just killing you?

871
01:16:57,040 --> 01:16:58,758
Let her go!

872
01:16:59,160 --> 01:17:00,479
Or what?

873
01:17:04,680 --> 01:17:07,274
It's over. Parnell, it's all over.

874
01:17:07,680 --> 01:17:10,478
Get the car.
I'll tell you what's over.

875
01:17:12,240 --> 01:17:14,595
Say goodbye to your little boy.

876
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,594
You're next. Hold it!

877
01:17:20,320 --> 01:17:21,309
You know...

878
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:28,118
this is really going
to give me a great deal of pleasure.

879
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:48,829
Nobody hurts my baby.

880
01:18:06,760 --> 01:18:10,230
Gee whiz. You shot him.

881
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:13,831
No shit.

882
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:16,677
Mom, you saved my life.

883
01:18:17,440 --> 01:18:19,635
That's what moms are for.

884
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:34,152
I can't believe it,
but I'm sad to see you go.

885
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:39,031
Oon't worry. I'll be back.
- Not too soon, I hope. Just kidding.

886
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:41,956
It's been great, Tutti.
- Such fun.

887
01:18:42,360 --> 01:18:46,194
I can see why you like policework.
It's so stimulating. - Yeah.

888
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:49,512
Can I see the ring?
- Okay.

889
01:18:50,440 --> 01:18:54,718
Beautiful. I couldn't have done
better if I'd picked it out myself.

890
01:18:55,120 --> 01:18:58,510
I thought you did.
- Mom, that's your flight.

891
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:04,672
Well, thanks for everything.

892
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:11,995
I think that man is a criminal.

893
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:15,315
I recognize him from TV.

894
01:19:15,720 --> 01:19:18,632
I don't think so. You'll be late.
- Joe, look.

895
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:20,871
He's trying to avoid the detector!

896
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:22,599
Please!
- Hey, young man!

897
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,230
Oon't give me that innocent look.

898
01:19:25,640 --> 01:19:29,872
My son is a police officer.
Oraw your gun. He's getting away.

899
01:19:31,680 --> 01:19:33,671
Rule no. 12: Listen to your mother!

900
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:41,194
Move!

901
01:19:46,720 --> 01:19:48,358
Here. Cuffs!

902
01:19:48,760 --> 01:19:51,638
Let us through. Police.

903
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:55,795
Joey, now I remember what he did.

904
01:19:56,640 --> 01:19:58,119
He shot his mother!

905
01:20:05,640 --> 01:20:15,119
