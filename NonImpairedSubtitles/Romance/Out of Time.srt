So, how's the pro
football quarterback?

164
00:12:47,289 --> 00:12:49,422
He's up north
hunting for the weekend.

165
00:12:52,459 --> 00:12:54,394
The whole weekend.

166
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:38,771
I got a splinter
in my butt.

167
00:13:38,773 --> 00:13:40,773
You okay?

168
00:13:40,775 --> 00:13:44,277
I'm okay.
I'm definitely okay.

169
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:45,545
It's all right.

170
00:13:48,616 --> 00:13:51,451
You still love her, don't you?
Huh?

171
00:13:51,453 --> 00:13:53,553
You still love her,
don't you?

172
00:13:54,622 --> 00:13:56,289
Yeah, I do.

173
00:13:56,291 --> 00:14:00,126
Yeah, you do. Will you divorce her?
You still got your ring on.

174
00:14:00,128 --> 00:14:02,762
Chris needs me.
Oh, okay.

175
00:14:02,764 --> 00:14:05,231
He does.

176
00:14:05,233 --> 00:14:09,034
He's lost, been that way
since he got cut from the team.

177
00:14:10,304 --> 00:14:11,804
I feel sorry for him.

178
00:14:11,806 --> 00:14:15,275
Remember that the next time
he goes upside your head.

Dr. Frieland.

This is my brother Matt.
Nice to meet you.

I'm sorry to

Right. Okay.

191

Ann, I'm afraid there's been
a bit of a setback.

192
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:46,198
I had your tests back yesterday.

193
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:54,039
The cancer is not in remission.
It's come back very aggressively.

194
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:56,442
It's attacked
your liver and lungs.

Well, that's difficult to say.

How long?

198
00:16:16,881 --> 00:16:18,431
Five, six months.

199
00:16:18,433 --> 00:16:20,232
No one can say for sure.

200
00:16:29,743 --> 00:16:31,644
But I feel--
I feel fine.

201
00:16:36,082 --> 00:16:38,117
Listen...

202
00:16:38,119 --> 00:16:40,653
There's a counselor here
at the hospital

203
00:16:40,655 --> 00:16:42,488
I'd like you to see.

Maybe you could speak to
her about the counseling?

209

Listen, you should be able
to do something, right?

210
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:05,411
What about that experimental stuff?
You know, like <i>60 Minutes?</i>

211
00:17:07,013 --> 00:17:08,380
I don't know.

212
00:17:08,382 --> 00:17:11,383
I mean, there are
alternative approaches.

213
00:17:11,385 --> 00:17:12,552
Yeah?
Sure.

214
00:17:12,554 --> 00:17:15,455
I mean, let's see...

Here. Take a look at those.

218
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:28,300
They're extremely expensive,
and there are no guarantees.

I'm sorry.

When I was with you, I--

226
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:53,258
I forgot about it.

227
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:57,096
For a couple hours,
I didn't think about dying.

228
00:17:57,098 --> 00:17:58,831
I understand.

You know, they've got
this alternative stuff.

230

There's a clinic in
Switzerland, and they say--

00:18:13,414 --> 00:18:15,047
I know. With my blood.

232
00:18:15,049 --> 00:18:18,217
I don't put much stock
in all that stuff.

233
00:18:18,219 --> 00:18:21,186
They said there's
a 17% success rate.

234
00:18:21,188 --> 00:18:23,756
A whole 17%?

235
00:18:23,758 --> 00:18:25,725
Odds are better
I'd hit the lottery,

236
00:18:25,727 --> 00:18:29,361
which is what I'd have to do
to afford something like that.

MATT: You're welcome.

were so jealous.

that's not why you called me.

What's up?

I wanted to show you
something.

again, did he?

No.

When we were married,

252
00:19:32,694 --> 00:19:35,695
we took out insurance policies
on each other,

253
00:19:35,697 --> 00:19:38,197
but they were only
for $100,000.

254
00:19:38,199 --> 00:19:41,567
This says $1 million.
Did you know about this?

255
00:19:41,569 --> 00:19:44,570
No. I remember
signing some things,

256
00:19:44,572 --> 00:19:46,939
but I didn't know
he made any changes.

257
00:19:46,941 --> 00:19:50,342
He can't get away with this.
This is fraud. You were sick.

258
00:19:50,344 --> 00:19:53,713
No. I was diagnosed
six months ago.

259
00:19:53,715 --> 00:19:56,082
Chris increased the policy
almost a year ago,

260
00:19:56,084 --> 00:19:58,350
right after my 32nd birthday.

261
00:20:00,754 --> 00:20:03,723

when she died of cancer.

He's here.

264
00:20:14,535 --> 00:20:16,702
Maybe he can explain this.
No.

265
00:20:16,704 --> 00:20:19,505
Why not? Now's the time.
This is not the time.

266
00:20:19,507 --> 00:20:22,108

and we've got
a potential murder.

Right.

It's not here.

She said she sent them.
Who's "she"?

Miss white.
Who's Miss white?

She's a supervisor over there.
I've dealt with her before.

Couple of minutes.

On somebody jaywalking?

Yeah, someone was jaywalking
or urinating on the sidewalk

861
00:54:50,375 --> 00:54:52,375

staggered home,
passed out next to my wife.

00:59:38,246 --> 00:59:41,514
I'll give you
a statement right now.

957
00:59:41,516 --> 00:59:43,349
What's the matter with you?

958
00:59:43,351 --> 00:59:46,885
You're like a love child
of Barney fife and Joe Friday.

959
00:59:46,887 --> 00:59:48,154
All right, a statement.

960
01:00:01,701 --> 01:00:05,438
What the hell was that about?
I was sleeping with her.

961
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:06,705
Jesus.

962
01:00:06,707 --> 01:00:08,524
So you...

963
01:00:08,526 --> 01:00:11,310
No, but it was all a plan,
them coming back here.

964
01:00:11,312 --> 01:00:13,663
They set me up.
They planned the whole thing.

965
01:00:13,665 --> 01:00:15,647
What plan?
What do you mean?

966
01:00:16,616 --> 01:00:19,151
I gave her
the Scarcetti money.

967
01:00:19,153 --> 01:00:21,087
God!

968
01:00:21,089 --> 01:00:24,156
Would you have given it to me
if I slept with you?

969
01:00:28,562 --> 01:00:31,163
Any trace of the money?
None.

970
01:00:32,232 --> 01:00:34,300
I thought I had
trouble with women.

971
01:00:34,302 --> 01:00:36,235
Maybe you should
just tell her.

972
01:00:36,237 --> 01:00:37,736
Who, Alex?
Yeah. Tell Alex.

973
01:00:37,738 --> 01:00:41,240
Are you out of your mind?
Look what they got on me.

974
01:00:41,242 --> 01:00:43,842
Motive--Ann Merai names me
beneficiary on her insurance policy,

975
01:00:43,844 --> 01:00:45,844
and I was having
an affair with her.

976
01:00:45,846 --> 01:00:47,879
Opportunity--
an eyewitness saw me

977
01:00:47,881 --> 01:00:50,216
outside their house
the night it blew up.

978
01:00:50,218 --> 01:00:52,318
You want to hear some more?

979
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:53,385
Alibi.

980
01:00:53,387 --> 01:00:55,020
Home, by myself.

981
01:00:55,022 --> 01:00:57,956
That good? At least you changed
your cell phone number.

982
01:00:57,958 --> 01:00:59,958
Even if Alex
wanted to believe me,

983
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:01,627
there's so much evidence
against me,

984
01:01:01,629 --> 01:01:03,061
she'd have to turn me in.

985
01:01:03,063 --> 01:01:04,863
You're right.

986
01:01:04,865 --> 01:01:07,233
That'd kill any chance you had
of getting back together.

987
01:01:07,235 --> 01:01:08,467
What?

988
01:01:08,469 --> 01:01:11,003
She says, "let's call
the divorce off."

989
01:01:11,005 --> 01:01:15,040
What are you talking about?
I'm looking at murder charges.

990
01:01:15,042 --> 01:01:17,876
The gal's a peach. I don't
know what you were thinking.

991
01:01:17,878 --> 01:01:19,445
Never mind. Forget it.

992
01:01:20,514 --> 01:01:21,847
Can I do anything?
[PHONE RINGING]

993
01:01:21,849 --> 01:01:24,183
You don't think obstruction
of justice is enough?

994
01:01:24,185 --> 01:01:26,185
I'm on a roll.

995
01:01:27,237 --> 01:01:28,654
Chief Whitlock.

996
01:01:28,656 --> 01:01:30,055
They matched the prints
on the pen.

997
01:01:30,057 --> 01:01:33,225
The guy's name is Paul Cabot.
He's done time before.

998
01:01:33,227 --> 01:01:35,394
They got his prints
from a criminal database.

999
01:01:35,396 --> 01:01:37,163
You got an address?

1000
01:01:37,165 --> 01:01:41,400
<i>Yeah. 36 Reef Road,</i>
<i>in Kendall.</i>

1001
01:02:09,196 --> 01:02:10,796
All right, come on.

1002
01:02:12,131 --> 01:02:13,299
Hurry up.

1003
01:02:26,313 --> 01:02:27,813
You want a beer?

1004
01:02:27,815 --> 01:02:29,381
Nah, I'm okay.

1005
01:03:02,482 --> 01:03:04,450
Ho ho ho.

1006
01:03:05,619 --> 01:03:07,886
What tangled webs we weave...

1007
01:03:07,888 --> 01:03:08,987
What you got?

1008
01:03:08,989 --> 01:03:10,822
Your doctor
worked at the hospital,

1009
01:03:10,824 --> 01:03:12,858
but seems he was
in my line of work.

1010
01:03:12,860 --> 01:03:14,460
Son of a gun.

1011
01:03:14,462 --> 01:03:16,161
Let's get out of here.

1012
01:03:16,163 --> 01:03:18,530
Let me get the beer.
Chae, come on, let's go.

1013
01:03:18,532 --> 01:03:20,366
Come on. I've got
to get the beer.

1014
01:03:20,368 --> 01:03:23,736
A beer in the hand
is worth two in the fridge.

1015
01:03:35,848 --> 01:03:37,015
What are you doing?

1016
01:03:37,017 --> 01:03:40,886
Bottom of the ninth.
Down by a lot of runs.

1017
01:03:40,888 --> 01:03:43,855
I got about
ten grand in the bank.

1018
01:03:43,857 --> 01:03:47,826
Get you down to Costa Rica.
You can scout out boats for us.

1019
01:03:47,828 --> 01:03:49,628
You think I'm done?

1020
01:03:49,630 --> 01:03:50,862
Mmm...

1021
01:03:50,864 --> 01:03:53,582
I appreciate the offer,
but I'm not running.

1022
01:03:53,584 --> 01:03:55,334
No. The idea
was I drive you.

1023
01:03:55,336 --> 01:03:59,237
Yeah, you can drive me.
Drive me back to the station.

1024
01:04:01,007 --> 01:04:02,541
All right.
All right.

1025
01:04:13,820 --> 01:04:16,021
Got your insurance company
on the line.

1026
01:04:16,023 --> 01:04:17,989
MAN:
<i>That policy number corresponds to</i>

1027
01:04:17,991 --> 01:04:20,526
<i>a $1 million</i>
<i>term life insurance policy</i>

1028
01:04:20,528 --> 01:04:22,194
<i>for an Ann Merai Harrison.</i>

1029
01:04:22,196 --> 01:04:23,796
Any messages there for me?

1030
01:04:24,864 --> 01:04:26,932
Who's the beneficiary?

1031
01:04:26,934 --> 01:04:28,934
<i>Just a moment here.</i>

1032
01:04:33,206 --> 01:04:34,440
<i>Let's see.</i>

1033
01:04:34,442 --> 01:04:39,578
<i>Looks like the beneficiary</i>
<i>is listed as...</i>

1034
01:04:42,732 --> 01:04:45,116
<i>Chris Harrison,</i>
<i>her husband.</i>

1035
01:04:48,855 --> 01:04:51,156
All right, thank you.
You've been really helpful.

1036
01:04:51,158 --> 01:04:54,159
<i>I'm sorry I couldn't be more--</i>
<i>wait a minute.</i>

1037
01:04:54,161 --> 01:04:56,161
<i>Wait a minute.</i>
<i>I got a note here.</i>

1038
01:04:56,163 --> 01:05:00,065
<i>It seems the policy holder</i>
<i>requested a form</i>

1039
01:05:00,067 --> 01:05:02,368
<i>to change the beneficiary</i>
<i>last week.</i>

1040
01:05:02,370 --> 01:05:04,403
So she changed it?

1041
01:05:04,405 --> 01:05:07,138
<i>Yeah, and if she did,</i>
<i>it's not in the system yet.</i>

1042
01:05:07,140 --> 01:05:09,875
So what does that mean?
Is that in the mail or...

1043
01:05:09,877 --> 01:05:12,177
<i>It could be downstairs</i>
<i>in our processing center.</i>

1044
01:05:12,179 --> 01:05:14,813
Waiting to be processed.
Can you connect me?

1045
01:05:14,815 --> 01:05:16,849
<i>I think they're</i>
<i>still out to lunch.</i>

1046
01:05:16,851 --> 01:05:19,585
All right, so call back
in half an hour?

1047
01:05:19,587 --> 01:05:21,219
<i>Sure, why not?</i>

1048
01:05:21,221 --> 01:05:22,454
Thank you.

1049
01:05:27,326 --> 01:05:29,595
<i>This is Bill.</i>

1050
01:05:29,597 --> 01:05:30,929
How you doing, Bill?

1051
01:05:30,931 --> 01:05:34,032
<i>Good. What have you</i>
<i>been up to?</i>

1052
01:05:34,034 --> 01:05:36,869
You got no idea.
Let me ask you a favor.

1053
01:05:36,871 --> 01:05:39,872
I've got
a credit-card statement,

1054
01:05:39,874 --> 01:05:41,807
capitol one
credit-card statement

1055
01:05:41,809 --> 01:05:43,341
on a Paul Cabot.

1056
01:05:43,343 --> 01:05:46,144
I need you to find out the
last place he used his card.

1057
01:05:46,146 --> 01:05:47,479
I got something for you.

1058
01:05:47,481 --> 01:05:48,980
<i>C-A-B-O-T?</i>
Yeah.

1059
01:05:48,982 --> 01:05:50,783
<i>Can you hold?</i>
Yeah. No problem.

1060
01:05:50,785 --> 01:05:53,452
I found this under the seat
of one of the Harrison's cars.

1061
01:05:53,454 --> 01:05:55,487
It's a bank card receipt
to a gas station

1062
01:05:55,489 --> 01:05:57,756
used by a guy named Paul Cabot.

1063
01:05:57,758 --> 01:06:00,392
ALEX: Nice.
Check the phone records.

1064
01:06:00,394 --> 01:06:02,093
Already on it.
Paul Cabot.

1065
01:06:02,095 --> 01:06:05,497
Anybody know or ever heard
of a Paul Cabot?

1066
01:06:05,499 --> 01:06:08,133
Come on, people, wake up.

1067
01:06:08,135 --> 01:06:10,436
Yes? No?

1068
01:06:10,438 --> 01:06:11,470
ALL:
No.

1069
01:06:11,472 --> 01:06:12,971
Paul Cabot?

1070
01:06:12,973 --> 01:06:15,541
Frank, call the bank,
see what they've got.

1071
01:06:15,543 --> 01:06:18,677
No records of any incoming or
outgoing calls to a Paul Cabot.

1072
01:06:18,679 --> 01:06:20,646
Check every restaurant,
gas station...

1073
01:06:20,648 --> 01:06:22,147
BILL:
<i>Matt?</i>

1074
01:06:22,149 --> 01:06:24,349
Yeah, Bill?
<i>I've got something.</i>

1075
01:06:24,351 --> 01:06:27,519
If this guy took a piss
and paid for it, I want to know.

1076
01:06:27,521 --> 01:06:30,689
<i>He's got a reservation</i>
<i>at the Costa Coral Hotel.</i>

1077
01:06:30,691 --> 01:06:32,390
There's a hold on it now?

1078
01:06:32,392 --> 01:06:33,725
<i>He checked in yesterday.</i>

1079
01:06:33,727 --> 01:06:35,861
Costa Coral hotel.
<i>You know where it is?</i>

1080
01:06:35,863 --> 01:06:37,863
Yeah. On Atlantic Avenue.
<i>Yeah.</i>

1081
01:06:37,865 --> 01:06:40,098
You're a lifesaver.

1082
01:06:50,844 --> 01:06:52,444
Chief Whitlock?
Yeah.

1083
01:06:52,446 --> 01:06:54,279
Agent white.
This is Agent Fetzer.

1084
01:06:54,281 --> 01:06:56,482
We're here to pick up
the Scarcetti money.

1085
01:06:56,484 --> 01:07:00,586
Agent Stark said to send
the money to his office.

1086
01:07:00,588 --> 01:07:02,420
My guy left five minutes ago.

1087
01:07:02,422 --> 01:07:05,591
He told you we'd pick it up.
He said send it to his office.

1088
01:07:05,593 --> 01:07:07,893
He told you to send
the money to the office?

1089
01:07:07,895 --> 01:07:09,160
He'll tell you.

1090
01:07:09,162 --> 01:07:10,696
<i>Let me talk to him.</i>

1091
01:07:10,698 --> 01:07:12,230
He wants to talk to you.

1092
01:07:12,232 --> 01:07:13,815
Hello.

1093
01:07:13,817 --> 01:07:15,534
What the hell is your problem?

1094
01:07:15,536 --> 01:07:17,369
I told you to get that
money ready,

1095
01:07:17,371 --> 01:07:19,571
<i>that I was sending agents--</i>
you said--

1096
01:07:19,573 --> 01:07:21,607
what are you, a parrot,
telling me what I said?

1097
01:07:21,609 --> 01:07:23,008
I know what I said.

1098
01:07:23,010 --> 01:07:26,011
No, I'm not a parrot.
I know what you said.

1099
01:07:26,013 --> 01:07:27,779
Then where the hell
is the money?

1100
01:07:27,781 --> 01:07:30,165
If you shut up
for five minutes,

1101
01:07:30,167 --> 01:07:32,050
I can tell you
where the money is.

1102
01:07:32,052 --> 01:07:35,721
I sent the money to your office.
My guy just left.

1103
01:07:35,723 --> 01:07:38,089
<i>He should be up there</i>
<i>in about an hour.</i>

1104
01:07:38,091 --> 01:07:41,159
<i>If you have a problem with that</i>
<i>after I hang up in ten seconds,</i>

1105
01:07:41,161 --> 01:07:43,529
call your partners at the IRS,
tell them to audit me.

1106
01:07:43,531 --> 01:07:44,963
You little bastard!

1107
01:07:44,965 --> 01:07:46,832
<i>Agent Stark,</i>
<i>Agent Stark.</i>

1108
01:07:46,834 --> 01:07:48,317
What? What?

1109
01:07:48,319 --> 01:07:49,601
I meant five seconds.

1417
01:37:05,825 --> 01:37:07,825
I want that evidence money,

1418
01:37:07,827 --> 01:37:10,327
or you're gonna be looking
at a case of your own--

1419
01:37:10,329 --> 01:37:13,864
where the hell is Southeast
63rd street in Miami?

1420
01:37:13,866 --> 01:37:15,766
53rd street, Chae.
No.

1421
01:37:15,768 --> 01:37:17,735
I told you 53rd street,
not 63rd.

1422
01:37:17,737 --> 01:37:19,336
No, you did not.
Yes, I did.

1423
01:37:19,338 --> 01:37:21,138
I said Southeast 53rd--

1424
01:37:21,140 --> 01:37:23,107
you said,
"those assholes in the DEA

1425
01:37:23,109 --> 01:37:25,976
are at 8400
Southeast 63rd street."

1426
01:37:25,978 --> 01:37:27,711
I didn't.
I'm sorry, agent Stark.

1427
01:37:27,713 --> 01:37:30,213
What I said was,
"those assholes from the DEA

1428
01:37:30,215 --> 01:37:34,151
are at 8400
southeast 53rd," Chae.

1429
01:37:34,153 --> 01:37:36,319
63rd.
Never mind.

1430
01:37:36,321 --> 01:37:38,656
Just give them the money.
Give them the money.

1431
01:37:40,324 --> 01:37:42,926
You don't have to count it.
It's all there.

1432
01:37:42,928 --> 01:37:44,561
Have a safe ride home.

1433
01:37:47,431 --> 01:37:49,499
Come on.
Assholes.

1434
01:37:51,736 --> 01:37:54,872
It is all there, right?
Most of it.

1435
01:37:54,874 --> 01:37:58,375
It's all there. Jesus.

1436
01:37:58,377 --> 01:38:01,178
That's a pretty good one.
Nice touch.

1437
01:38:01,180 --> 01:38:02,579
A little over the top.

1438
01:38:02,581 --> 01:38:03,947
Which part?
Your part.

1439
01:38:03,949 --> 01:38:06,616
My part? You're the one
that came in here screaming.

1440
01:38:06,618 --> 01:38:08,085
What happened to you, man?

1441
01:38:08,087 --> 01:38:11,055
Just never leave your wife.
That's what happened to me.

1442
01:38:12,456 --> 01:38:13,991
I'd take the bullet.

1443
01:38:14,826 --> 01:38:17,627
Be careful there.
It's a classic, okay?

1444
01:38:17,629 --> 01:38:19,930
That grille work
comes from France.

1445
01:38:21,066 --> 01:38:23,567
How you feeling?
Excuse us.

1446
01:38:23,569 --> 01:38:26,837
Yes, ma'am.
Did you love her?

1447
01:38:28,940 --> 01:38:30,007
No.

1448
01:38:31,743 --> 01:38:33,977
Why would you do this, then?

1449
01:38:35,747 --> 01:38:37,681
Because I'm...

1450
01:38:39,117 --> 01:38:42,019
Because I'm stupid.
Because...

1451
01:38:42,021 --> 01:38:43,921
I thought I was doing
the right thing,

1452
01:38:43,923 --> 01:38:46,924
trying to help her,
but it's no excuse.

1453
01:38:46,926 --> 01:38:51,428
Alex, sometimes people,
you know,

1454
01:38:51,430 --> 01:38:52,863
do stupid things.

1455
01:38:55,066 --> 01:38:58,035
Especially when
they're still in love.

1456
01:39:08,146 --> 01:39:09,913
Thank you.

1457
01:39:09,915 --> 01:39:11,115
Let's go.

1458
01:39:55,093 --> 01:39:57,560
[DOOR OPENS, CLOSES]

1459
01:39:57,562 --> 01:39:58,662
Chae?

1460
01:40:01,816 --> 01:40:02,800
Hello.

1461
01:40:04,368 --> 01:40:05,335
Hi.

1462
01:40:07,172 --> 01:40:09,239
How you doing?
I thought you were Chae.

1463
01:40:09,241 --> 01:40:12,409
He called all worked up
about something.

1464
01:40:12,411 --> 01:40:13,977
Okay.

1465
01:40:13,979 --> 01:40:15,679
You, uh,
you want to sit down?

1466
01:40:15,681 --> 01:40:17,047
Yeah.

1467
01:40:27,158 --> 01:40:29,226
How you doing?
Good.

1468
01:40:29,228 --> 01:40:31,661
I ask that already?
Yes. I said I was good.

1469
01:40:31,663 --> 01:40:33,596
You want a beer?
Yes.

1470
01:40:35,716 --> 01:40:37,567
I don't have any left.

1471
01:40:37,569 --> 01:40:39,369
You can share mine, though.

1472
01:40:41,605 --> 01:40:44,007
So what brings you
out this way?

1473
01:40:44,009 --> 01:40:46,977
I just needed to move
the rest of my stuff.

1474
01:40:46,979 --> 01:40:48,678
Okay.

1475
01:40:48,680 --> 01:40:50,914
That's cool, I guess.

1476
01:40:52,516 --> 01:40:54,051
The house is a mess.

1477
01:40:54,053 --> 01:40:55,285
CHAE:
Say, Matt!

1478
01:40:55,287 --> 01:40:58,171
This came for you
at the station.

1479
01:40:58,173 --> 01:40:59,622
Hi, Chae.

1480
01:40:59,624 --> 01:41:02,326
You opened it? You opened my mail?
Yeah.

1481
01:41:02,328 --> 01:41:05,462
Why you always opening my mail?
Read it.

1482
01:41:05,464 --> 01:41:07,497
They just want you
to fill out the forms.

1483
01:41:07,499 --> 01:41:09,432
"To claim amount payable
to the beneficiary

1484
01:41:09,434 --> 01:41:11,468
for the sum of $1 million."

1485
01:41:12,636 --> 01:41:14,771
What?
We're rich.

1486
01:41:14,773 --> 01:41:16,406
The enclosed forms...

1487
01:41:16,408 --> 01:41:18,775
We're rich.
How about that?

1488
01:41:18,777 --> 01:41:21,144
$1 million.
Easy, Chae. Easy.

1489
01:41:21,146 --> 01:41:24,882
He can't take that money.
I can't take the money?

1490
01:41:24,884 --> 01:41:28,018
Why not?
It's a conflict of interest.

1491
01:41:28,020 --> 01:41:31,488
He's the legal beneficiary.
I am the legal beneficiary.

1492
01:41:31,490 --> 01:41:33,874
And he's one of
the arresting officers.

1493
01:41:33,876 --> 01:41:36,459
What the hell's that got to do
with anything? So what?

1494
01:41:36,461 --> 01:41:39,629
Tell him how much trouble
you can get in.

1495
01:41:39,631 --> 01:41:41,164
Matt, it's a million bucks!

1496
01:41:41,166 --> 01:41:43,700
It's the chance
of a lifetime! No!

1497
01:41:43,702 --> 01:41:45,102
No, Chae.

1498
01:41:45,104 --> 01:41:49,306
As his wife, I'm telling you
he's not taking that money.

1499
01:41:49,308 --> 01:41:51,808
As my wife?
As your wife.

1500
01:41:52,877 --> 01:41:55,012
Matt, come on.

1501
01:41:55,014 --> 01:41:57,180
Come on, don't fall for that.

1502
01:41:57,182 --> 01:42:00,317
What do you mean as my wife?
As your wife.

1503
01:42:00,319 --> 01:42:03,387
You said you came
to move your stuff.

1504
01:42:03,389 --> 01:42:05,688
I'm moving back in.

1505
01:42:05,690 --> 01:42:08,708
This is great. Congratulations.
It's kind of fortuitous.

1506
01:42:08,710 --> 01:42:10,627
You serious?
Yeah.

1507
01:42:10,629 --> 01:42:12,562
Are you gonna behave?

1508
01:42:12,564 --> 01:42:15,165
I'm actually afraid
to leave you by yourself.

1509
01:42:15,167 --> 01:42:17,534
You won the sweepstakes, man.

1510
01:42:18,803 --> 01:42:21,438
Matt, you can do this later.
It's a million bucks.

1511
01:42:21,440 --> 01:42:23,307
Let's not lose focus.

1512
01:42:23,309 --> 01:42:28,245
You know, a honeymoon fund,
a nursery wing for the...

1513
01:42:28,247 --> 01:42:30,380
Matt, this is the--the--
the golden pot

1514
01:42:30,382 --> 01:42:32,615
at the end of
the storm thing!

1515
01:42:32,617 --> 01:42:34,318
Matt?

1516
01:42:34,320 --> 01:42:36,486
Just sign it
before you go in, huh?

1517
01:42:38,456 --> 01:42:40,523
I'm not gonna let you
do this to yourself.

1518
01:42:40,525 --> 01:42:42,826
I'm gonna be sitting out here
when you're finished.

1519
01:42:42,828 --> 01:42:45,929
I can wait three minutes.
I'm a patient man.

1520
01:42:45,931 --> 01:42:49,433
I am a patient man.
Come on, Matt!
