Wake up.
Oh. Oh,Jason.

My God, what happened ?
[ Grunting ]

425
00:29:17,028 --> 00:29:18,962
Buddy.
I had to get rid of Buddy.

426
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:21,863
What ?
He had to go.

427
00:29:21,933 --> 00:29:24,766
You could've killed yourself.
I mean, who knows ?

428
00:29:24,836 --> 00:29:27,566
This could affect
your coordination,
your neurological system.

429
00:29:27,639 --> 00:29:30,130
It could even affect
your intelligence. We don't
even know ifthis is gonna work.

430
00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:33,744
Only one way to fii nd out.

00:30:05,177 --> 00:30:07,577
Okay, Sherman,
what is this about ?
Denise.

Listen to me, Denise.
Listen.

435
00:30:14,953 --> 00:30:17,046
You know, fii reflies,
when they're searching
for a mate,

436
00:30:17,122 --> 00:30:20,614
the way they findone another
is they emit apheromone,

437
00:30:20,692 --> 00:30:22,853
and I've synthesized it
into a spray form.

438
00:30:22,928 --> 00:30:27,592
Wait a minute.
You brought me out here
for an experiment ?

Denise, wait, please !
Just hear me out !
Please, don't leave.

440
00:30:29,534 --> 00:30:31,798
Sherman, why did you act
that way the other night ?

441
00:30:33,205 --> 00:30:35,867
Well, Denise,

442
00:30:37,809 --> 00:30:40,972
when I found out that you might
be leaving, itjust got me
all messed up inside.

443
00:30:41,046 --> 00:30:42,980
I said some things
I really didn't mean at all.

say it better than me.

Phleer Pharmaceuticals, largest
drug company in the world.

I told them about your
little discover, and they
made a preemptive offer.

to Phleer the formula works at
the press conference I set up.
