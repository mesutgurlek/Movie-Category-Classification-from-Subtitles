1
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,800
I was in seventh grade...

2
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,080
when I realized
I was invisible,

3
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,560
Well, not that kind of invisible,

4
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,360
No, it was more like I was
just,you know, kind of,.,

5
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,400
Anonymous, A-N-O-N-

6
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,880
I-M-O-U-S,

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,040
Anonymous,

8
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,320
I'm sorry, That's wrong,

9
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,560
W-O-R-N-G, Wrong,

10
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,120
It's not that I didn't try,

11
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,240
I mean, I was always a real...

12
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,920
Loser,

13
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:03,880
L-O-S-E-R, Loser,

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,240
Homework for tomorrow...

15
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,720
Of course,
when it came to love...

16
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,840
Pass it on,

17
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,080
Yeah, That sucked,

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,240
S-U-C-K-E-D, Sucked,

19
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,800
There was another thing
working against me,

20
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,200
Hi,

21
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:24,040
Hey, I'm Justin,
I live just next door...

22
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,160
and, uh, my mom sent me over...

23
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,760
with these brownies
or something,

24
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,000
Oh, hi, I'm Kate,
W-We just moved here,

25
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,040
I mean, duh- the boxes
and everything...

26
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,480
Holy jama lama,

27
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,280
KATE:
That other thing is... my mom,

28
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,400
Hi, I'm Lori,

29
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,000
Um... I made these for you,

30
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,120
Be careful; you're hot,
I mean...

31
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,800
they're hot,

32
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,000
So hot,

33
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,600
She's never had any trouble
landing men,

34
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:56,000
She's just had trouble keeping them,

35
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:59,160
I used to keep track,
but I found it exhausting,

36
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,160
So, I just call 'em all... Skip,

37
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,280
Hi, Kate,

38
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,960
I'm going... to be...
your new... father,

39
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,520
Maybe we shouldn't...

40
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,240
get ahead
of ourselves now, Skip,

41
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,960
It's, uh, it's Steve, kiddo,

42
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,840
Why do you keep calling me Skip?

43
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,440
KATE:
Because, eventually...

44
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,840
that's what they all do,

45
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,720
It's happened so many times
that my mom's developed...

46
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,920
a very mature reaction,

47
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,000
A quick therapy session...
or two... or three...

48
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,320
and then we pack up the car
and flee to another town,

49
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,600
Okay, maybe being invisible
does have its advantages,

50
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,480
LORI:
Excuse me!

51
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,200
Because, moving all the time...

52
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,920
I never had to deal with the
whole ''awkward good-bye''thing,

53
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,040
All right, guys, here we go,

54
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,640
I'm open!

55
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,000
here's me,

56
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,400
It wasn't easy,
but in just a few short months...

57
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,240
I went from
''sort of unknown''to...

58
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,040
Are you a narc?

59
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,400
But enough about me,

60
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,840
This story isn't even about me,

61
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,880
It's about him,

62
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,520
John Tucker,

63
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:05,160
Let's face it, He is the man,

64
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,040
Captain of the basketball team,
his family's loaded...

65
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,400
and he looks somewhere
between an Abercrombie model...

66
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,640
and a Greek god,

67
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,880
Tucker!

68
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,040
Let's go,John!
Kill the Bobcats!

69
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,520
Not real bobcats,
I mean, they're endangered,

70
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,560
This is Carrie Schaefer,

71
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,280
It's no question who's taking
the Kodiaks to State this year,

72
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,160
John Tucker here,
also known as ''Tuck''...

73
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,680
- ''T-Man,'' ''T-Dog...''
- T-Dog!

74
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,200
...some people
call me ''T-Money''...

75
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,240
but I'm best known
as ''El Capitan,''

76
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,920
Ho-ho, Heather!

77
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,200
Whoo-hoo!

78
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,840
Shake it, baby!

79
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,520
Short skirts equals talent, Yay,

80
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,000
Heather's hot!

81
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,400
Go, Kodiaks!

82
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,200
Go Kodiaks!

83
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,080
Hey, Table six,

84
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,560
I remember the first time...

85
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,840
I spoke toJohn Tucker,

86
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,160
It's not like he blew me away
or anything,

87
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,600
I mean,
I was totally in control,

88
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,000
- Hi,
- Yes,

89
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,560
I mean... no,

90
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,600
I-I mean, y...

91
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,800
I'm... not quite ready to order,

92
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,160
Thanks,

93
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:46,680
Please tell me
I did notjust curtsy,

94
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,640
What was I thinking?

95
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,120
Of course a guy like that
already has a girlfriend,

96
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,440
That's Carrie Shaeffer,

97
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,880
Runs the school TVstation...

98
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,840
not to mention
the Honor Society...

99
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,440
Junior Achievers, 4-H Club...

100
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,000
Future Filmmakers of America,
Big Sisters...

101
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,840
Adopt-A-Shut-In, and...
I think that's it,

102
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,640
I've decided to write
a children's book,

103
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,840
Oh, and she's writing
a children's book,

104
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,320
Mm! You are so sexy
when you speak French,

105
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,840
Mm...

106
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:22,600
Uh, do you guys...
want a minute?

107
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,120
KATE:
Whoa, scratch that,

108
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,520
He's got two girlfriends,

109
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,160
That one's Heather,
head cheerleader,

110
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,440
Sort of self-explanatory,

111
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,800
And Molly's all...

112
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,640
''Why don't
we 'Stomp, Fight, Roar?'''

113
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,800
''Stomp, Fight, Roar?''

114
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,880
I know!

115
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,400
I mean, at halftime?
What a dud,

116
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,720
Two green salads,
dressing on the side,

117
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,240
Salmon for her,
Lobster for me,

118
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,560
I love when you do that,

119
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,760
I love doing that,

120
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,120
I love that you love
that I love you doing that,

121
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,920
And... no need to rush
between courses,

122
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,160
That top...
looks so hot on you,

123
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,320
I bet it's even hotter
off of you,

124
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,520
JOHN:
Never been here before, babe...

125
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,960
so I hope they have
good vegetarian,

126
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,680
Okay, stop it already,

127
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,040
Three girlfriends?

128
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,400
JOHN:Oh, no! Veal?

129
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,760
I'm sorry,
Let's just go,

130
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,120
You know, if I wanted
to torture animals...

131
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,360
I'd go to a medical lab,

132
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,640
Hey,

133
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,840
Which...

134
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,640
I would never do, 'cause
they... torture animals,

135
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,600
Okay, I'm not passing judgment...

136
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,000
but, for whatever reason...

137
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,440
being a vegan teen activist
is usually code for ''easy, ''

138
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,080
You know, for you, I don't have
to give up all meat,

139
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
See? I'm not making
this stuff up,

140
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,120
I don't get it,

141
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,760
I mean, these girls all
seem so confident and cool,

142
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,800
How do they not know...

143
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,560
thatJohn's cheating
on all of them?

144
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,000
He's a total operator,

145
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,040
He goes out with girls
from different cliques...

146
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,240
so that they never
actually talk to each other,

147
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,800
And then he
tells them that his father...

148
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,960
won't let him date
during basketball season...

149
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,720
so they'll have
to keep it a secret,

150
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,480
How'd you learn all this stuff?

151
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:03,960
I don't know,Just a guess,

152
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,960
- Hey, there he is,
- Yo, bro,

153
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,120
- He did?
- Yeah, totally,

154
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,560
Hold on, one second,

155
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,280
Hey, Yeah, actually...

156
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,200
What's up, fellas?

157
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,520
What's up, man?

158
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,480
Yo, Tuck!

159
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,320
Agua, please?
And some popcorn,

160
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,040
What's up, girl?

161
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,240
Hey,

162
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,640
Lookin' good,

163
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,800
Hey,Johnny,

164
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,840
Hey,

165
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,120
Hey,

166
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:01,320
You got something sweet for me?

167
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,040
Of course,

168
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:06,200
I don't know,

169
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,840
John was confident...

170
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,760
in his system forjuggling girls...

171
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:23,200
but even he couldn't anticipate
the events of Black Tuesday,

172
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,040
Oh, my gosh!

173
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,760
Coach Claypoole!
Are you all right?

174
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,760
How was he to know...

175
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,520
Coach Claypoole had acute angina?

176
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,840
It wasn'tJohn's fault,

177
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,200
It was a pre-existing condition,
and she stabilized...

178
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:42,120
and took early retirement
in Sun City, Florida,

179
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,520
John Tucker,

180
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,120
Anyway, the point is...

181
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,240
Coach Claypoole is
in the hospital...

182
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,520
so we're combining
all first period gym classes,

183
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,120
Yeah, yeah, I know,
We all hate each other,

184
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,120
No, we hate you,

185
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:00,160
Okay,Jennifer, Alison, Molly...

186
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:03,440
Sarah, Denise and Kimmi, this side!

187
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:06,520
My name is Lucretia!

188
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,160
On this side, I want Beth,
Carrie, Heather and...

189
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,120
what's-your-face,

190
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,880
I'm Kate, Kate,

191
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,400
All right, ladies...
let's play ball!

192
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,800
You're Heather, right?
I'm Kate,

193
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,480
So?

194
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,000
You weren't at the party last night,
Where were you?

195
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,760
Well, this is totally on the DL,
I mean, not fit to print,

196
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:30,200
I'm dating...John Tucker,

197
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,880
Hey!

198
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,080
Sorry, It slipped,

199
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,320
Okay, All right, I'm fine,

200
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,320
Okay, everybody, Let's play,

201
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,960
You know what?

202
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,840
That was no accident!

203
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,200
He's mine!
Stay away from him!

204
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,320
Oh, you little brat!

205
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,800
Oh! Girls! Peace and love!
Come on!

206
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,160
No guy is worth fighting over!
Stop!

207
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,360
There's nothing to fight about!

208
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,520
John Tucker's mine!

209
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,560
Oh!

210
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,840
What the hell is your problem?

211
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,120
I am dating John Tucker,

212
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,520
Enough!

213
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,440
She knocked her out,

214
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,000
Let's get back in the game,

215
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,600
I said, ''Enough!''
Stop it, Beth,

216
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,320
Darn it, Coach,
Let me at her!

217
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,440
-Just let me get them!
- Put those balls down!

218
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,440
Put those balls down!
Put down those balls!

219
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,360
Just stop!

220
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,200
This guy is cheating on all of you...

221
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,320
and instead of taking it out on him...

222
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,280
you're beating the shit
out of each other?!

223
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,320
Language!

224
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:52,040
Detention,
You, you, you and you!

225
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,680
Honestly,

226
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,560
Who is that?

227
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,080
I don't know,
Pam... something,

228
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,680
Uh...

229
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,520
Sorry, it's, uh...

230
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,320
Cheap Trick, I understand,

231
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,840
Yeah, Yeah, it is,

232
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,880
Yeah, you can't really hum
to Cheap Trick,

233
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,160
No, once you've started...

234
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,920
you're kind of obligated to...
to belt it out,

235
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,880
Yeah,

236
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,080
I'm Scott,

237
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,560
You're from...
Chemistry, right?

238
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,480
Yeah, Yeah, I'm-I'm Kate,

239
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,320
So, um, where is everybody?

240
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,320
Detention?

241
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,200
You-You came early
to detention?

242
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,000
Oh, um, well, it's, you know...

243
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,520
I would hate
to m-m-miss a minute...

244
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,640
of being... detained,

245
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,000
Hey, babe,

246
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,440
Hey,John,

247
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,640
I had a great time with
these two on the beach,

248
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,120
Ugh...

249
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,160
Oh, Wow,

250
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,640
That's not, uh, usually
the reaction he gets from girls,

251
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,200
It's generally more like a...

252
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,600
Yeah, okay,

253
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,360
''Jerk'' isn't really my type,

254
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,600
Yeah, you're right,

255
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,360
He can have his jerk moments,

256
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,680
Oh, I thought he was you
guys'... god, or whatever,

257
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,320
You're close,
He's my older brother,

258
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,880
Oh, You're the other Tucker?

259
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,240
What is that? Is that, like,
''the loser Tucker''?

260
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,840
Oh, no, no,
That's not what I meant,

261
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,680
I just... you just don't look...

262
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,920
Hot, buff, or capable of
inciting an all-girl smackdown?

263
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,240
No, you're right,

264
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,360
Naw, it's-it's cool,

265
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,480
I'll let you in on a secret, though,

266
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,040
My mom...

267
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:02,640
says I'm special on the inside,

268
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,960
Good for you,

269
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,560
Yeah,

270
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,360
John? Can I talk to you for a sec?

271
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,000
Yeah, sure,

272
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,480
Later, guys,

273
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,120
Later, man,

274
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,440
So, what's up?

275
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:23,040
In PE today, some loser said
that she went out with you,

276
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:27,040
Really?
And you believed her,

277
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,680
No, I mean, I don't know,

278
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,800
You can't have a girlfriend...

279
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,560
...in basketball season,

280
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,920
But...

281
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:38,680
if I could...
you know who it'd be,

282
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:52,120
You know, I don't know why
girls say stuff like that,

283
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,120
I mean, I think they're just...

284
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,400
jealous of what we have,

285
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,480
Because we share
something special,

286
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,000
Something we don't have to label,

287
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,800
You know, it's...
it's an unspoken bond,

288
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,040
And I love how secure you are,

289
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,840
All right,

290
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,840
Detention has begun,

291
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,200
I'll be right back,

292
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,880
And no talking!

293
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,520
So, I talked toJohn,

294
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,960
It was sweet,

295
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,480
He felt bad for you,

296
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,840
He said that you were jealous because...

297
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,440
we share something special,

298
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,720
Something that...

299
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,080
we didn't have to label
because it's...

300
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,520
Because it's our unspoken bond...

301
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:25,760
and I just love
how secure you are?

302
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,760
And it hurts me to hear
you question it?

303
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,080
Because you're the...

304
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,120
...only girl for me?!

305
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,160
Damn!

306
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,000
He said the same thing
to all of us,

307
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,360
Figures, He makes up with us...

308
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,000
and then he hooks up with us...

309
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:38,920
You guys hooked up?

310
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,000
John and I share
something special,

311
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,560
Oh, what, that you've both
been in your pants?

312
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,800
We share a vegan/nonviolent
outlook on life,

313
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,480
Hippie slut,

314
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,960
Oh, nice, Heather,

315
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,400
It's not like everyone
doesn't know...

316
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,120
that Little Miss Cheerleader
brings it on,

317
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,920
- Look...
- You, too?

318
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,200
-John and I belong together,

319
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,240
He is the team captain,
and I am...

320
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,560
the head cheerleader,

321
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,840
Oh, I'm sorry...

322
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,000
what kind of cheerleader?

323
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,080
Oh, like he'd take
either of you two seriously!

324
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,120
- Do not lump me with her!
- Oh, so, what...

325
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,120
- now you're better than me?
- Shut up,

326
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,320
- What?
- Excuse me?
- What?

327
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,640
Sorry, S-Sorry,

328
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,800
You have something to say?

329
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:15,920
Uh...

330
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,600
No, it's none of my business,

331
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,440
What?

332
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,160
Okay, let me guess,

333
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,240
Does he always use pet names
like ''baby''...

334
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,680
and ''sweetheart''?

335
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,440
Yeah, it's not out of affection,

336
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,200
It's so he won't mix up your names,

337
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,040
And-And he's all about
an unspoken bond...

338
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,400
or something special,
but never about a relationship,

339
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,240
A-And the whole arrangement
was your idea...

340
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,480
so you feel guilty
that he cheated,

341
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,440
Oh, my God,
You're dating John, too,

342
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,800
No, uh...

343
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,200
No, I just knew a guy like him,

344
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,240
Skip,

345
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,680
She's right, I mean,
he's always making me feel guilty,

346
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,840
- Yeah,
- It seems to me...

347
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,600
that if a guy treats you
like that, it...

348
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,520
You'd break up with him,
Blah-blah-blah-blah,

349
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,640
John would have another
girlfriend in a second,

350
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,000
No, I didn't say, ''break up,''

351
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,400
I'd get even,

352
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,000
Who are you?

353
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,520
I know!

354
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:09,160
You're that girl who wigged out
last year and got sent to rehab!

355
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,000
No, I...

356
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,480
Then you got taken away
for bulimia,

357
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,760
- No,
- Fat camp?

358
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,800
- No, My name's...
- Hey! No talking!

359
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,160
- My name is...
- No... talking!

360
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,600
Hey, honey!

361
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,840
I'm in a hurry,

362
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,240
I've got a...
big date tonight,

363
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,640
Drummer?

364
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,680
Doctor,

365
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,160
Well, veterinarian,


366
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,720
Technician,

367
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,640
- So you're dating a dog nurse,

368
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:49,040
You've...
got a friend at the door,

369
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,240
What?!

370
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,720
LORI:
Have fun, girls!

371
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,280
Kate, right?

372
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,480
Yeah, Kate,

373
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,000
I wanna bring down
you-know-who,

374
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:09,640
Normally I'm opposed to
the slaughter of animals...

375
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,080
but in John Tucker's case,
I'll make an exception,

376
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,320
I don't even know him,

377
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,480
So? You don't know anyone,

378
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,840
You're like the Swiss,
You're neutered,

379
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,400
Uh, it's neutral,
Kate, if the three of us...

380
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,160
tried this alone,
we would kill each other,

381
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,120
You brought us here,
You showed us that we have...

382
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,160
something in common,

383
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:26,880
Exactly,
We all wanna killJohn Tucker,

384
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,880
Wow,

385
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,000
Okay,

386
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,720
Learning Center?

387
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,120
Who knew this was here?

388
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,720
Look at him, struttin' his
stuff like he owns the place,

389
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,840
Well, he does,

390
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:42,920
For now,

391
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,760
This way,

392
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,320
Don't touch anything,

393
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,080
Wow,

394
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,440
You spend way too much time
in after-school programs,

395
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:55,160
Thank you,

396
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,040
Beth, can you get the lights?

397
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,800
It's the remote...
labeled ''lights,''

398
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:04,000
Okay, guys, Let's go,

399
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:08,240
Please try and pay attention,
and all cell phones off,

400
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,160
Kate... do your thing,

401
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,240
My thing? Oh, okay,

402
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,800
What... is it
that attracted you toJohn...?

403
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,400
Kate, I like where
you're going with this,

404
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,480
Okay, girls, we need
to defineJohn,

405
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,160
He's a statue
wrapped in a painting...

406
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,640
in a frame made of muscles,

407
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,040
But what makes him tick?

408
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,120
Is it that charm?
Is it that smile?

409
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,040
Is it that perfect tan?

410
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,560
What is it, girls?
Dig deep,

411
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,080
It's everything,

412
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,880
It's his eyes...

413
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,200
his lips,
his chest, the...

414
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,800
the way that,
when he holds you...

415
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,200
his whole body
kinda tightens...

416
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,640
Uh, we all know what happens
when boys get happy,

417
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,680
Not what I meant!

418
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,080
You guys,
save it forJohn, okay?

419
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,120
Look, back to the point,
We all agree he's hot,

420
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,160
So, what do we do?

421
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,840
Well, in cheer, we usually
tear down the other team...

422
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,640
by undermining their confidence,
makin' 'em feel lame,

423
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,200
I don't think
this is a case for...

424
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,000
''U-G-L-Y, you ain't
got no alibi,''

425
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,280
Shut up,

426
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,440
Heather, as much as I hate to
admit this... you have a point,

427
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,080
Right,

428
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
And-And sinceJohn's game is
that he always has a date...

429
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:15,600
to get even with a guy like that,
you make him... undatable,

430
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,960
Yes,

431
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,160
- Undatable,

432
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,920
A systematic destruction...

433
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,160
of all that is John Tucker,

434
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,440
Girls... I think
I have an idea,

435
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,680
I'm telling you, babe...

436
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,880
you could make your
looks work for you,

437
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,320
Don't you think, Robert?

438
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,480
You know, Robert
knows my mom...

439
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,600
and he shoots for
Vogue, Elle, GQ,

440
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,120
And of course he's done...

441
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:42,120
all my yearbook photos since
middle school on recycled paper,

442
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,600
Okay,John,

443
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,640
The trick is just relax...

444
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,240
and behave naturally, yeah?

445
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,680
Now pout for me,John! Pout!

446
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,480
More pouting, yeah!
Oh, yeah, I love you,

447
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,080
I love you,
Now make me hate you!

448
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,200
Hate me! Yeah!
Oh, yeah!

449
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,680
Oh, you hate me!
Oh, you hate me,John!

450
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,200
Nice, nice, nice!
Now you're a tree,

451
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,840
It's windy,
Shake your branches!

452
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:00,920
- Big storm,John,
- It's good,

453
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,320
Big storm, Bigger,
bigger, bigger,

454
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,320
Now hate me,John,

455
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,160
Hate me,

456
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,160
Oh, you hate me,John!

457
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,080
It is so amazing that
you're into sculpture,

458
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:13,120
I mean, what are human beings
here for if not to, you know...

459
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,880
make... horses and stuff
out of clay?

460
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Really? I'm so glad
you feel that way,

461
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,160
Totally,

462
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,960
Hey, isn't that you?

463
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,800
I do some part-time
male modeling,

464
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,080
- Really?
- Yeah,

465
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:30,000
I didn't know that,

466
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,040
-Can I have a sip?
- Yeah,

467
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,120
I know that guy!

468
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,320
Um...

469
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,040
What?! No, I...

470
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,000
I don't have that,

471
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,840
Holly... I-I-I
don't have that!

472
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,440
God, ooh,
Don't touch me,

473
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,360
- Don't touch me, Don't touch me,
- Holly, wait!

474
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,760
Holly!

475
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,960
That's him!

476
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,560
What? No, that's not real,

477
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,800
I only model
as a guy with herpes,

478
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,560
Goin' to the free clinic, Tuck?

479
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,800
Rule #1 in warfare;

480
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:14,200
Never underestimate
your opponent,

481
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,760
Oh, I love you, Tucker!

482
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:18,600
I don't personally suffer
from an STD...

483
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,560
but one in five young adults do,

484
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:24,480
And I am proud to give my voice
to the silent,

485
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,080
That's right, baby!

486
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,080
- Thanks!

487
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,880
Okay, it should've worked,

488
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,800
I mean,
are we missing something?

489
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,720
- I am, My social life,
- Hey!

490
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,040
Hey, Ms, Spencer,

491
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,120
''Lori,'' please,

492
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,000
So, what are you girls up to?

493
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,000
- Destroying a man,
- Ooh, who do I make my check out to?

494
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,240
He's totally indestructible,

495
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,480
We give him herpes,
they give him an award,

496
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,720
Fake herpes, Mom, N...

497
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:01,120
It was a whole reputation thing,

498
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,640
It's a long story,

499
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:06,120
Sure, Yeah, the old ''fake herpes,
reputation...'' thing,

500
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,320
You know, um...

501
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:10,760
I can unpack the groceries
if you've got... stuff,

502
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,160
I get it, All right,

503
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,560
Play nice, girls, Hmm,

504
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,760
Okay, your mom is so hot!

505
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,880
She does Yogalates,

506
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,680
Carrie, what are you
always typing on there?

507
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,800
Oh, lists...
normal stuff, same as everyone,

508
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,680
I have my ''To Do'' list,
my ''Goals'' list...

509
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,360
my ''Contingency'' list,
my ''Observations''...

510
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,560
my ''Notions,'' which, of course,
are very different...

511
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,000
because ''Observations'' require
a topic sentence...

512
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,640
and ''Notions'' do not,

513
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,760
Normal stuff,

514
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,080
Right, Normal,

515
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,160
Totally,

516
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:43,120
Well, at least
I'm not medicated,

517
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,200
Excuse me, This is an
all-natural beauty supplement,

518
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,320
What are you taking?

519
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:52,120
Estrogen? Heather!

520
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,720
They torture innocent
horses for this,

521
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,280
It's made from their pee,

522
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,320
Peeing isn't torture,
Menopause is,

523
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,320
I steal it from my mom,

524
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,080
Guys take steroids to get pecs,

525
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,000
I just wanna go up a cup size,

526
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,160
I don't think
it works like that,

527
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,480
It stops your natural
hormone production,

528
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,600
Yeah, and when you run out...

529
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,800
you're gonna grow
a mustache and a penis,

530
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,480
Are you serious?

531
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,160
Okay, you guys,
we've gotta get back toJohn,

532
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,120
Okay, What we need
is one major hit...

533
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:18,960
that's gonna crush his whole
macho thing, you know?

534
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,600
We need him to understand
what it feels like to be us,

535
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,000
Right,

536
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,600
And what's more terrifying
to a man than...

537
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,040
not being manly?

538
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:35,080
I wanna see a three-man weave
from center,

539
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,600
Two hands, Matt,

540
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,880
You, too, Chris,

541
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,400
All right, keep it goin' now!

542
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,160
All right, here we go,

543
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:43,400
Alex, you, too,
Come on, Pick it up,

544
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,080
Better, Tucker,

545
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,680
Take a drink, you guys,

546
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,080
What's up, babe?

547
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,080
Hey,

548
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,440
How you doin'?

549
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,440
Good,


550
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,800
Um, are you tryin' to bulk up?

551
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:05,160
Yeah, Coach has me
drinkin' 'em twice a day,

552
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:08,160
Oh... not working,

553
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,240
I mean, the slim look works
for some guys, but...

554
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,400
you're definitely losing tone,

555
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,720
I'm losing tone?

556
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:16,800
Yeah, Maybe you should
double up doses,

557
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:19,160
Yeah, Maybe you should
double up doses,

558
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,640
Yeah, Yeah, Thanks for
the heads-up, babe,

559
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,400
Hey,

560
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,680
Oh,

561
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:43,840
Hey,

562
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,480
Hey, can I ask you a favor?

563
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,480
Uh, I'm-I'm in need
of a lab partner,

564
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,280
I was with Alex, but...

565
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,480
he got burnt pretty badly
in an experiment, so...

566
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,360
Oh, Well, before I say yes...

567
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,680
how exactly did he get burned?

568
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,320
Uh, well, that is open
to interpretation...

569
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:04,440
because he will say that it was
my fault, but I clearly said...

570
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,480
''Dear God, man, you're on fire,

571
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,840
Run for your life,''

572
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:08,840
A clear warning,

573
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,000
Yeah,

574
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:12,080
Okay, Well, uh,
you can start by measuring...

575
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:15,800
40 milliliters into that
graduated cylinder,

576
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,680
All right,



578
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,480
Whoa, Slow down,

579
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,920
Huh? All right,

580
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,120
Get down at eye level,

581
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:28,160
And wait till the bottom of
the meniscus is at that line,

582
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,120
I'm-I'm sorry,
The meniscus?

583
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:33,000
Wait till the curvy part
is at the doodad,

584
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,040
All right,

585
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,200
Slowly,

586
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:41,800
Stop right... there,

587
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:42,800
- Oh!
- Oh!

588
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:43,800
Oh, God! I...

589
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,040
Oh, my gosh!

590
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,880
Shit, I spilled it!
What do I do? What is this?

591
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,280
- Sodium chloride suspension,
- Oh, God, I have to get...

592
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,400
- Ow, it's burning,
- Really?

593
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,920
'Cause, uh, sodium chloride
is... saltwater,

594
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,000
Ah, it's burning!

595
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,480
Oh, Well, okay,

596
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,000
Then I didn't burn myself,

597
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:02,040
It just kinda...
looks like I peed,

598
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,240
- Hey!

599
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,120
Hey, all right, All right,
This is just silly!

600
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,200
This is...

601
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,040
Hey! Cool it,

602
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,240
Yeah, Kate,

603
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,520
Geez, cool it,

604
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,920
What?

605
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,520
Lay off,
That's sensitive,

606
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,160
I'm sorry, princess,

607
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:43,640
Did you chip a nail?
Really, how many times do I...

608
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,000
have to flush
before you go away?

609
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,160
Play clean,

610
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:50,400
Hey, if I wanted to listen to
an asshole, I would've farted,

611
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,240
That's an awful thing to say,

612
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,600
We got a technical foul:
23 with a push,

613
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:00,680
He started it,
He's bein' mean,

614
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:09,200
Dude, that's mine!
I got low blood sugar!

615
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,320
I need it,

616
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,880
Do my thighs look fat
in these shorts?

617
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,640
De-fense! De-fense!

618
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,120
John!

619
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,120
John!

620
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,200
Come on,John!

621
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,040
What? Why are you
lookin' at me like that?

622
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,040
I'm open!

623
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,800
Fine!

624
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:30,320
You see?
Now look what you made me do,

625
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,200
- Time, ref,

626
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,800
John, you okay?

627
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,040
Yeah, Why?
Don't I look okay?

628
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,640
'Cause I feel okay,
I feel fine,

629
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:46,160
I'm great,
What are you saying?

630
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,320
I'm saying focus,

631
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,960
We got one minute left on
the clock to finish this game,

632
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,920
I'm in it,

633
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:54,440
On three, One-two-three...

634
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,080
ALL:
Kodiaks!

635
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,640
Tucker,
Tucker, are you okay?

636
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,600
Can you finish the game?

637
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:20,960
No,

638
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:23,200
I-I-I'm anxious and bloated...

639
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,480
and...my nipples hurt,

640
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,000
Don't be a pansy-ass!

641
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,920
We need ya,
Get up, Let's go,

642
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:32,080
No! I won't!

643
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,080
I mean, i-i-it's always me,

644
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,080
''W-W-We need you,John,
Let's go,John,

645
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,680
John-John-John!''

646
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,360
You're always yelling at me...

647
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,680
but you never listen to me,

648
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,600
What about my feelings?

649
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,200
It was a kill-strike...

650
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,720
Leave me alone!

651
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,320
...and it landed
with shock and awe,

652
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,080
Thanks to us,
girls would no longer be...

653
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,120
under the reign
ofJohn Tucker's charm,

654
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:00,600
He had finally fallen
from grace...

655
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,240
and we were
on top of the world,

656
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,000
Bye, guys!

657
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,440
Yo, what's up, guys?

658
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,000
Tommy,

659
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,440
Mm-mm, mm-mm,

660
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:22,800
What you did
on the court last night...

661
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:26,040
was the most courageous thing
I've ever seen any man do,

662
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,560
This is my peer-counseling hotline,

663
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,800
Give it a call
anytime you want to talk,

664
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:35,040
I stay up late,

665
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,800
A real man knows how to feel,

666
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:45,160
I want to feel a real man,

667
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:48,080
If you ever need a shoulder
or a hug or, you know...

668
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,240
anything... I'm here,

669
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,680
Rule #2 in warfare;

670
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,240
never, ever,
underestimate your opponent,

671
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,040
Hey, sweetie,
Can we talk?

672
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,520
Look... I know
I wigged out last night,

673
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,200
My peer counselor says
I need to look into...

674
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:05,000
my emotional responsibility,

675
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,480
So, I've been doing
some ''me'' work...

676
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,080
and, uh, it's really been
clearing things up,

677
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,520
Hmm,

678
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:15,280
And, well, you know there's
only one girl for me,

679
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:18,360
But... I don't think
that girl is you,

680
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,600
I mean, we had a fun run,

681
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,120
You know?
I'm just ready to find...

682
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,720
something deeper, more complex,

683
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,520
So... we good?

684
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,360
Well... he dumped me,

685
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,480
That shallow bastard
thinks I'm not complex?

686
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,240
You, like, invented complex,

687
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,480
I'm so depressed, I couldn't
even enjoy the break-up sex,

688
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:55,000
Oh, my God, I'm such a slut!

689
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,080
Ow!

690
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,600
- Oh, God!

691
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,160
I can't believe
I ate meat for him,

692
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,680
I mean, it was fish...

693
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,920
Still, I don't eat anything
with a face,

694
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,200
Mm, try this,
It's really good,

695
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,160
Chocolate on chocolate,

696
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,480
Oh, yeah,

697
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:14,320
Chocolate is theJohn Tucker...
of all snack food,

698
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,840
What, it's gotta get with
every candy on the shelf?

699
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,600
No, no, no, chocolate makes
everything better,

700
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,360
My mom says that it can even
mend your broken heart,

701
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,680
You know, I was thinking...

702
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,840
instead of doing all this...

703
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:28,600
we should've just
broken his heart,

704
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:31,160
What?

705
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:34,000
Heather, that's pretty genius,

706
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:37,040
Yeah, except he broke up
with everybody,

707
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:41,040
Not... everybody,

708
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,800
What? I...

709
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,360
- No,
- Mm-hmm,

710
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,680
I can't do that,

711
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,000
- I don't even like him,
- So?

712
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:50,000
You're not really
gonna be dating him,

713
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,440
You'll be pretending,

714
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,440
Exactly,

715
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,720
Look, I know what
you're thinking,

716
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,440
''I'm not as pretty as Heather,

717
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,720
''I'm not that smart,

718
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,360
''I'm not that...

719
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,440
experienced,''

720
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:02,680
That's true,

721
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,000
But you have us,

722
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:07,680
And we can make you into anything,
If we combine...

723
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:10,160
all of us, we can make him
fall in love with you-

724
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,040
I mean really fall in
love- and then we'll...

725
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,360
yank it all out from under him,

726
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,360
This is gonna be so good!

727
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,760
No, it's just not gonna work, I...

728
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,040
Kate, look...

729
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:22,000
I know you think I'm just
a superficial cheerleader...

730
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,360
but... I do have feelings...

731
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,880
and they got crushed
because of your idea,

732
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,440
I used all my mom's
estrogen pills...

733
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,120
and now she looks
like Bernie Mac,

734
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,440
Sorry,

735
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,000
You guys, I...

736
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,480
You know what? Forget it,

737
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,280
You couldn't pull it off anyway,

738
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,920
Let's go,

739
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:40,760
Oh, well,

740
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,760
All right,

741
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,240
Wait,

742
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,920
Just tell me what to do,

743
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:47,960
- Yes!
- Oh!

744
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,080
- Ha!

745
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,320
Now, the first step is so easy,

746
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:55,040
There's one thing
John Tucker cannot resist,

747
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,240
Okay, girls, This is Kate...

748
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:58,000
and she'll be
taking Nancy's spot,

749
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:00,080
- What?
- Well, you know, you've...

750
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,640
got that bum leg
and everything, Sorry!

751
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,800
But it's just a sprain,

752
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,720
The doctor said
I'd be better in a week,

753
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,480
Maybe next year, kiddo,
You fought a good fight, though,

754
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,600
Okay, pyramid!
Kate, you're on top,

755
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:12,160
What? No, no, no,
I get dizzy in high heels,

756
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,440
Come on!

757
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:15,480
John loves girls on top,

758
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,600
Of the pyramid! Hello!

759
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,240
Trust me, it's an honor,

760
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:22,480
Molly's been waiting
three years to get up there,

761
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,600
Right, Molly?

762
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,040
Yeah, you go ahead,

763
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:29,040
It's your first day,
You earned it,

764
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,920
Okay, Up-up-up!

765
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,360
Good,

766
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,320
Straight legs,

767
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,040
Nice and steady,

768
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,040
Big smile!

769
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,360
I did it!

770
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,040
Kodiaks, attack...!

771
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,440
Sorry,

772
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,720
Well, if you can crush John
like you crushed Molly...

773
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,360
I think we got it,

774
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,800
Don't be sorry, Be strong,

775
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:55,120
The most important thing
a cheerleader wears...

776
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,000
is her attitude,

777
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,440
Watch this,

778
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:02,080
BOY:
That is hot!

779
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,480
I can do that,

780
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,560
Hey, how you doin'?

781
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,400
Heather...we're cool, right?

782
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,400
What?

783
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,640
Who's the new cheerleader?

784
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,160
Ow,

785
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,560
That's Kate,

786
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,080
She's cute,

787
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,120
Not gonna happen,

788
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,880
She's not into
high school boys,

789
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:32,040
That's it?

790
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,440
We just planted the seed,

791
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,880
What'd he say about me?
Did he say anything?

792
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,240
He said that?
He really di...?

793
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,600
Uh, oh, my gosh,
I-I mean...

794
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:41,160
you didn't even introduce me,

795
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:43,160
Should I go talk to him?

796
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:45,000
I-I'll go... No?

797
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,200
What?

798
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,400
Okay, emergency meeting,

799
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,520
I think we're sending Kate in
before she's ready,

800
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:57,640
I... I'm totally ready,

801
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:01,000
Really? Tell 'em
whatJohn said about you,

802
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,760
Oh, what, about me being cute?

803
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,960
Oh, No, it's
just a comment,

804
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,080
If anything, it's an insult,

805
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,040
I know he's just getting
ready to use me,

806
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,120
Kate, I'm confused,
but I thought you said...

807
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,040
you had experience
with guys like this,

808
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:15,280
I do, I-I've watched my mom date
a million and one of these guys,

809
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,080
But have you ever dated one?

810
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Have you ever dated
a John Tucker?

811
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:21,960
Have you ever dated... anyone?

812
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,920
- Define ''anyone,''

813
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,320
Oh, my God! I'm totally not ready!
I'm gonna blow this...

814
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,720
No, no, no, no,
You're gonna be fine,

815
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,920
All right, stop, Stop,

816
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,720
Okay, look,
you'll be fine, okay?

817
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:35,720
You just gotta remember
to be cool and... collected,

818
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:38,080
Yeah, Be caring and passionate,

819
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,840
Be proud and... aggressive,

820
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,080
You've got to make him
chase you, okay?

821
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,240
If it's easy...

822
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,720
he'll move on,

823
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,160
Do you understand?

824
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:48,120
Mm-hmm,
Yes, I-I have it,

825
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,040
It's totally under control,

826
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,280
Okay,

827
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,880
So...he really said
you were cute?

828
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:58,280
Yeah, I mean, that's what
Heather said, and... Damn it!

829
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,600
Okay, okay, look,

830
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,320
It's not that hard, Um...

831
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:03,120
When he speaks to you...

832
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,360
count to three...

833
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,440
in your head
before you answer him,

834
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,880
Don't show any interest,
Don't even look at him too much,

835
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:09,960
- Hm,
- Yeah, no,

836
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:12,440
You got it?

837
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,960
I said do you have it?

838
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,560
I was counting to three,

839
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:16,640
Not that slowly,

840
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,640
We don't want him to think
you're retarded,

841
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,040
Um... sorry,

842
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,280
It's my bad,

843
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,320
Bye,

844
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,920
Hey,

845
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,280
John Tucker?

846
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,160
Hi,

847
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,040
So... you must be new,

848
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:44,760
Well, not ''new'' new, but...

849
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,920
new to cheer,

850
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,520
Okay, don't tell me,

851
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:55,200
Tell me Friday night...
at dinner,

852
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:58,920
I'm captain of the team,
You're our new cheerleader,

853
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,840
I'm obligated to buy you dinner,
School rules,

854
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,320
Thank you, but I'm
gonna have to pass,

855
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,480
You busy, or...?

856
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:10,320
Sure, I'm busy,
Nice to meet you, Bye,

857
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:13,160
What?

858
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,800
Uh... you know,
there's actually...

859
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,360
a pretty decent music scene
around here,

860
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,200
You know,
if I ever know...

861
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:32,080
you know, I mean, if I...
ever hear of a good show...

862
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,760
I could maybe...
you know, I could...

863
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,760
I could let you know...

864
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,800
about that show,

865
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,920
Where are you supposed to be?

866
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,240
You don't belong in this class,

867
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:45,320
I-I'm just supposed
to drop these off,

868
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,160
Thanks,

869
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:52,080
Uh, excuse me? Who are you?

870
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,520
Whoa, Hey,

871
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:57,000
What's going on h...
What is your name, son?

872
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:59,160
Attention, fellow students,

873
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,640
If Kate is out there in
Loudspeaker Land, my number is...

874
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:05,120
555-6467,

875
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:07,240
Give me a pen,

876
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,800
I'm the captain of the team,

877
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,160
You're our new cheerleader,

878
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,600
I'm obligated to buy you dinner,
School rules,

879
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:15,160
Thank you, but I'm gonna have to pass,

880
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:17,040
Uh, how'd you guys get this video?

881
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:19,040
I've been documenting our efforts,

882
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,560
Great! Make a video,

883
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:23,040
MaybeJohn'll get
a role on The O,C,

884
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,480
It's our expose,

885
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:27,040
We're gonna show everybody
the realJohn Tucker,

886
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:29,600
And how we broke his... heart,

887
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,200
It'll be like...

888
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,400
Prime Time Tucker,

889
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,000
Hasta la vista, motherf...

890
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,120
Stop...

891
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,240
with the rhyming,

892
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,480
Now, that's good,

893
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,920
Do it like this,

894
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,600
-John...
-Hey, sweetie,

895
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,840
there's only one guy
out there for me...

896
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,120
I just don't think
that girl is you,

897
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,160
- ...and you are not...
- Not him!

898
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,480
We good?

899
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:48,920
We are so gonna neuter him!

900
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,840
- Kate, do one,
- Uh...

901
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:55,160
John, there's only one guy
out there for me,

902
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,880
- You are not him,
- No, don't hold back,

903
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,560
How do you want to
be a cheerleader...

904
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,920
with no attitude?

905
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,720
I... don't want to be
a cheerleader,

906
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:03,840
Kate...

907
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,120
everyone wants to be
a cheerleader,

908
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:07,080
Come on, you got to sell it!

909
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,280
John...

910
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:12,200
there's only one guy
out there for me...

911
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:15,120
- but you are not him,

912
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,120
No,

913
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:18,760
Kate, this is for
every guy out there...

914
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,880
that's ever lied to any girl,

915
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Okay?

916
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,480
Okay, action,

917
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:30,400
John Tucker, there's only
one guy out there for me...

918
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:33,120
but you are not him,

919
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,920
Damn,
You are gonna be a legend,

920
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:40,800
Yeah,

921
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,440
Oh, hey,

922
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,680
Hey,

923
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,320
Did you like the flowers?

924
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:59,560
Uh, yeah, if you're...
into that sort of thing,

925
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:02,200
'Cause... I didn't
get a phone call,

926
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,720
I didn't have a pen,

927
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,240
- Scrappy!
- Oh!

928
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,960
- Hey, man,
- Hey,

929
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:21,920
So, you're lab partners
with Kate, right?

930
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:24,440
You talk,
What's her deal?

931
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,680
Yeah, I don't know, man,

932
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,600
I don't think
she's your type, though,

933
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,680
''Girl'' is my type,

934
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,200
- All right, well...

935
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:36,000
then-then maybe, uh,
you're not her type,

936
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,600
She's into stuff like...

937
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:39,480
old-school Elvis Costello;
she listens...

938
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,000
to obscure podcasts;

939
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:42,960
she reads Dave Eggers,

940
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:45,400
You know, she's...
she's deep, man,

941
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,160
Dude... I'm deep,

942
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:49,640
I'm dating the Poetry Club,

943
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,080
Oh,

944
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,200
So,John asked you to spy on me?

945
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:56,040
Yeah, he heard we
were lab partners...

946
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,240
so he's having me tail you
and find out what I can,

947
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,440
Although, I am supposed
to be playing it cool...

948
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,520
and not giving anything away,

949
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:05,040
You're, like,
the worst spy in the world,

950
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,520
Or am I the best
spy in the world?

951
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,680
Who's waiting by the phone,
and who's chatting up the girl?

952
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,160
- That's true,
- Eh?

953
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:13,120
I have a kink,
I have a kink in my neck,

954
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:16,000
That's probably those
new cheer muscles of yours,

955
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:18,440
Are you making fun of me?

956
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,800
Uh, a little bit, yeah,

957
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:26,840
Um... sorry,

958
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:29,000
- Yeah, uh...
- All right,

959
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,440
- These are your books,
- Yeah,

960
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:31,400
I'm gonna go,

961
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:32,640
''Go, Fight, Roar,''

962
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:33,680
Yeah, Right, Yeah,

963
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:34,920
Bye,

964
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,760
Shit,

965
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,520
Here we go, Kodiaks, Here we go!

966
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:40,600
Yeah, baby!

967
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:43,560
Defense!

968
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,560
Hey, I think I totally
blew it with John,

969
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:48,240
I mean, he hasn't even looked
at me since I turned him down,

970
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:49,760
Relax, Kate, this is going
to work, I promise,

971
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:50,920
H-How do you know?

972
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,120
I just know, I promise,

973
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,920
Kate Spencer,

974
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:55,360
How you doing?

975
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:57,160
Good, How are you?

976
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,520
Not so good,

977
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,640
See, I like this girl,
but she doesn't know I exist,

978
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,480
Tucker! Get in the game!

979
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,920
I'm baring my soul, here, Coach,

980
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:07,240
John, I understand and respect
your emotional needs...

981
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:10,840
Ball!

982
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,440
So, Fridays...

983
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,480
we usually go out to the beach,
watch the sunset,

984
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,200
You should come,

985
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,040
U-Uh...

986
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,720
Come on,J,T,!

987
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:19,680
-John...
- Tucker, shoot!

988
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,200
KATE:
If it'll make him shoot, okay,

989
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,160
You,

990
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:30,280
Yeah!

991
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:35,000
Kodiaks are number one!

992
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:36,560
After Thursday's game,
it's no question...

993
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,080
which Kate S, has taken
the school by storm...

994
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:39,920
capturing the full attention...

995
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:41,520
of the school's greatest prize...

996
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,120
-J,T,!

997
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:45,560
Tucker! Tucker! Tucker!

998
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:49,040
Tucker! Tucker! Tucker! Tucker!

999
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,680
Sorry,

1000
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,920
I've never done this before,

1001
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,040
You put it on her bra?

1002
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,160
Guys, he is gonna find that...

1003
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,760
in, like,
the first five minutes,

1004
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:02,000
Or not,

1005
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:04,400
Beth, can you speak
into the cleavage?

1006
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:06,880
Um... Kate's boob cam,

1007
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,560
Testing, testing, Hello,

1008
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:10,560
You guys,

1009
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:11,520
Oh, my gosh!

1010
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:12,720
- Hello!
- Oh, my gosh!

1011
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:15,680
-Waah... waah...
-Okay,

1012
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:16,880
Okay,

1013
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:19,120
You know, if we play
our cards right...

1014
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:22,200
we can keep this going all
the way tillJohn's birthday,

1015
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:24,240
That may just work, See?

1016
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:26,480
I've already made a projected
Heartbreak Timeline...

1017
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:28,280
based on John's
average conquests...

1018
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:29,680
compared to Kate's
rising Cool Factor,

1019
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:30,840
Hmm!

1020
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,080
So, it leads to two events:

1021
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:34,000
the away game
and John's birthday party,

1022
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:37,200
Now, I say our best chance
at heartbreak...

1023
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:38,600
is to see how much
he cares about Kate,

1024
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,080
So we test him...

1025
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,400
at the away game, and then...

1026
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,400
we crush him...

1027
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:44,520
...at his party,

1028
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:45,880
Bingo,

1029
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,080
How do you know he's going
to have a party?

1030
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:50,240
Oh, you're so new,
it's cute, Okay,

1031
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:53,880
John's birthday is, like,
homecoming combined with prom...

1032
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,800
combined with MTV Music Awards,

1033
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:58,320
So are you ready for him?

1034
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:00,000
Yes, Okay, so, um,
I play hard to get,

1035
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:02,520
I-I count to three,
I've got it,

1036
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,080
No,

1037
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,520
That's when you were
playing hard to get,

1038
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,080
You're going out,
He's got you,

1039
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:11,480
So I count... to four?

1040
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:14,240
Oh, my God, I don't know
what I'm doing!

1041
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,080
I mean, this is
a really bad idea, you guys!

1042
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:17,040
Chill out!

1043
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:18,520
Look, you're with three girls...

1044
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:19,680
who know how he
operates, okay?

1045
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:20,920
You'll be fine,

1046
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:22,040
Okay, I'm going to beJohn,

1047
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:23,440
Heather, be Kate,

1048
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:24,720
I don't want to be Kate,
You be Kate,

1049
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:25,760
Can I be Kate?

1050
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:27,160
Fine, let Kate be Kate,

1051
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:28,720
-Just go,
- Okay,

1052
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:32,240
Baby, it's your lucky day...

1053
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:33,640
'cause I'm going
to take you out tonight,

1054
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,160
Where do you want to go?

1055
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:36,360
I don't know,

1056
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:37,880
Where do you want to go?

1057
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,160
No! He's not in control, remember?

1058
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:41,480
You are, Right?

1059
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:43,360
- Mm-hmm,
- Now, try it with me,

1060
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:46,080
Honey, you know I'm all about
what makes you happy,

1061
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:48,560
So, what movie?

1062
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:50,280
Anything you want,

1063
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:54,640
What do you think I want?

1064
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:56,720
And don't be wrong,

1065
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:01,760
- Ka-pow,
- Nice,

1066
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:04,920
- Okay,
- These,

1067
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:06,800
Okay, wait, it can't
hide the camera,

1068
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:08,960
Cleavage, It's going
to go in the sweater,

1069
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:10,720
It'll be perfect,
We'll hide it right under this...

1070
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:21,120
Kate, Hey, you made it,

1071
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:22,800
Yeah,

1072
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:23,920
Hey, Kate,
How's it going?

1073
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:25,080
Hi, Tuck, Kate,

1074
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:26,760
- Hey, Kate,
- Looking good, Kate,

1075
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:29,000
Hey, Kate! It's Becky
from Student Council,

1076
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:30,160
Oh, hey!

1077
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:31,560
Hey, what's up, Kate?

1078
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:34,600
Looks like I'm out with
the most popular girl in school,

1079
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:36,600
Lucky you,

1080
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:39,400
So... tell me about yourself,

1081
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:41,960
I want to know everything;
your whole story,

1082
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:43,240
Oh, my story,

1083
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:45,480
Um... It's still being written,

1084
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:47,080
So... it's a mystery,

1085
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:48,360
Mm-hmm,

1086
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:49,600
I like mysteries,

1087
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:51,080
Really?

1088
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,720
I mean, what do you
like about them?

1089
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:55,360
I don't know,

1090
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:57,120
I guess...

1091
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:59,400
I like secrets,

1092
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:02,120
I bet,

1093
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:07,840
Okay, You're right,

1094
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:09,400
Too much talking
ruins the moment,

1095
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:13,200
Let me just stand here
and enjoy this,

1096
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:14,440
John,

1097
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:15,640
Shh...

1098
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:18,080
The sunset is that way,

1099
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,040
Yeah, no, I'm just enjoying...

1100
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:21,960
everyone staring at me
in insane jealousy,

1101
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:25,040
They wish they were out
with a girl like you,

1102
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:29,480
So, how did I end
up out tonight...

1103
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:31,600
with the most amazing
girl in school?

1104
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:33,320
I mean, was it
my irresistible charm...

1105
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:36,440
or... my really nice butt?

1106
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:38,840
I think it was
your incredible modesty,

1107
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:40,120
- Liar!
- Oh, shit!

1108
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:41,120
He's in his zone tonight,

1109
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:43,120
I hope she can handle it,

1110
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:44,880
The beach, the sunset...

1111
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
At least there's no romantic fire,

1112
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:48,280
Ah!

1113
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,000
Mine's on fire!

1114
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:51,200
Thank you,

1115
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:56,600
Ew,

1116
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:59,080
So, um...

1117
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:01,120
can I give you a ride home?

1118
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:03,240
Now?

1119
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:05,040
Yeah, Yeah,

1120
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,160
Um...

1121
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:11,120
I have to pee,

1122
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:14,520
That was too much information,

1123
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:15,960
It's okay,

1124
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:17,640
Your secret's safe with me,

1125
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:18,960
I-I gotta make sure...

1126
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:20,880
Tommy's got a ride home,
anyway, so, uh...

1127
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,680
I'll meet you at the truck?

1128
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:27,160
Yeah, Yeah,

1129
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:35,000
Hello,

1130
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:36,720
I need some help here,

1131
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:38,320
We didn't prepare her for this,

1132
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,360
- Hi,
- Hey,

1133
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:44,640
Okay, a ride home?
Wh-what do I do?

1134
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:45,720
Just breathe,

1135
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:48,160
This is really good,
It means he's into you,

1136
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:49,160
Do you think
he's going to make a move?

1137
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:50,760
No, if anything,
it's just going to be a kiss,

1138
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:52,920
He keeps it PG-1 3
on the first night,

1139
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:53,480
Okay, Are you a good kisser?

1140
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:55,080
Okay, Are you a good kisser?

1141
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,560
I-I-I don't know,
How does anybody know?

1142
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:59,400
Do guys tell you
you're a good kisser?

1143
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:03,280
Oh, my God, I-I'm a bad kisser,

1144
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:04,760
Okay, stop,

1145
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:06,240
All we need is one kiss...

1146
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:08,040
and then you leave
him wanting more,

1147
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:09,480
It is not that hard, okay?

1148
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:10,960
Oh, my God,

1149
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:12,680
I'm going to have to
show you, aren't I?

1150
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:14,760
- Okay, Um...
- Right now?

1151
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:16,120
Okay, Quick, Okay,

1152
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:17,600
Come here,

1153
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:18,560
You lock in on him...

1154
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:20,080
grab onto that
gorgeous head of hair...

1155
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:22,440
and take control,

1156
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:24,800
Hold his gaze,

1157
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:27,520
Your lips might just touch,
but not yet,

1158
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:31,120
It's just gotta be the temptation,

1159
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:35,280
And then you give him
one light kiss,

1160
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:39,160
BOY:
Holy jama lama,

1161
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:40,400
Kiss her again,

1162
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:41,720
Do it,

1163
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:42,840
Get out of here, you little perv!

1164
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:46,440
- Shit!

1165
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:47,640
Kate, I'm gone,

1166
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:48,760
Kate,

1167
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:49,880
Can you kill the lights?

1168
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Uh...

1169
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:53,440
- Hey,
- Hey,

1170
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:55,680
- Hey,
- Hi,

1171
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,760
- What's wrong?

1172
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:00,520
Nothing, Nothing,

1173
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:02,360
I-I... I was just breathing,

1174
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:03,400
I...

1175
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:04,800
I breathe a lot,

1176
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:06,160
Right,

1177
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:12,200
Beth's still in the truck,

1178
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:14,120
What?!

1179
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:15,200
Slut in truck!

1180
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:16,320
Come on, We gotta move,

1181
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:17,680
Oh, my God,

1182
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:20,120
- Okay, okay, here we go,

1183
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:25,040
JOHN:
So...

1184
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:27,560
what kind of music you into?

1185
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:30,360
Good music,

1186
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:32,520
Think I might have some of that,

1187
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:34,520
Let's see,

1188
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,080
Here we go,

1189
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,080
You like Elvis Costello?

1190
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:51,040
You tell me you don't...

1191
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,480
I'm kicking you out
of the car right now,

1192
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:55,800
No, I-I-I love him,

1193
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:58,840
I mean... he's okay,

1194
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:01,120
I guess, Whatever,

1195
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:19,080
So what are some of
your other secrets?

1196
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,840
Uh...

1197
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:26,520
Well, if I told you,
I-I'd have to kill you,

1198
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:45,240
I'm glad we did this,

1199
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:46,680
I had a great time,

1200
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,920
Me, too,

1201
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:51,160
Um...

1202
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:53,160
Walk me to my door,

1203
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:56,000
Sure,

1204
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:09,040
Kate?

1205
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:11,640
I could walk you to your door...

1206
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:12,600
but...

1207
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:15,120
then I'd be too tempted to kiss you,

1208
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:18,800
And I really like you,

1209
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:20,120
You know? And I...

1210
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:21,960
I-I don't want to risk anything
by moving too fast,

1211
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:23,160
So...

1212
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:26,040
rather than torture myself...

1213
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:28,720
I'm just going to say good night,

1214
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:30,920
So... good night,

1215
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,960
- Ow!
- Ow,

1216
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:36,800
Ow,

1217
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:39,440
I-I think I bobbed
when you weaved,

1218
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:41,640
- Yeah,

1219
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:43,000
She's going off-book,

1220
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:44,120
What just happened?

1221
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:46,040
Is that Beth?

1222
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:47,280
What?

1223
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:48,440
Okay,

1224
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:52,080
Bye,

1225
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:56,680
I always like a little risk,

1226
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:09,240
- Oh, my gosh,
- Come on,

1227
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:12,080
HEATHER:
Uh-oh,

1228
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,120
Something is not right,

1229
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:32,920
Wh... whoa,

1230
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:36,000
- Kate?
- U-Um...

1231
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:38,240
I don't want to risk
anything by going too fast,

1232
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:44,760
Ah, Ah,

1233
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:54,160
It's not even my date...

1234
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:56,360
and he still gets me
out of my skirt,

1235
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:13,400
Whoa,

1236
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:14,760
Honey, what happened?

1237
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:16,880
The sprinklers, Sorry,

1238
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:20,120
Oh! That could ruin a date, huh?

1239
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:22,360
It wasn't a real date, Mom,

1240
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:23,880
Right,

1241
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,240
Um...

1242
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:28,240
Listen, uh...

1243
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:30,960
I don't think
this is such a good idea,

1244
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:33,000
You know,
pretending to like a guy,

1245
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:35,160
I just... I don't want
to see you get hurt,

1246
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:36,400
I'm not going to get hurt,

1247
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:38,480
He is,

1248
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:41,160
My advice...

1249
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:43,720
is not to do this,

1250
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:45,840
Mom, there's a lot of things
I come to you for advice about...

1251
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,120
but this is not one of them,

1252
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:49,760
I'm sorry, but...

1253
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:51,680
honestly, how manyJohn Tuckers...

1254
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:53,200
have pulled a hit-and-run on you?

1255
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:54,720
That's not fair,

1256
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:57,240
I have met some pretty
nice guys lately,

1257
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:58,640
Right, yeah,

1258
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:00,080
The drummer, the guy in rehab...

1259
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:01,840
and, throw in that one
from the tanning salon...

1260
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:03,560
and you've hit the trifecta,

1261
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:07,160
When did you get like this?

1262
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:09,440
A month ago,
you wouldn't like you right now,

1263
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:12,040
A month ago, nobody liked me,

1264
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:13,000
I did,

1265
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:17,240
I'm sorry, I just...

1266
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:20,000
It's been a long night,
I'm a little... you know...

1267
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:21,120
Yeah, it's okay,

1268
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:24,560
I got a little of that, too,

1269
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:28,120
Good night,

1270
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:30,080
Kate?

1271
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:32,800
Just be careful
who you pretend to be,

1272
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:36,200
I mean, I'd hate
if you forgot who you are,

1273
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:41,920
I was nobody, so there's really
no risk in losing anything,

1274
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,160
So, how long till you think
he's back again?

1275
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:52,640
I say he'll show up in
the next... 30 seconds?

1276
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:55,480
Come on,

1277
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:58,520
Ah, like clockwork,

1278
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:00,000
- That's call number five,

1279
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:02,000
That's two calls past desperate,

1280
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:04,320
- Get it,

1281
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:06,080
Hello,

1282
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:08,920
Hey, Kate, It's me,

1283
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:12,480
-John?

1284
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:13,800
John Tucker?

1285
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:16,680
Oh, yeah, Hey,
Um, I just got in, What's up?

1286
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:19,040
So, did you figure out...

1287
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:20,840
if you were doing anything on Saturday?

1288
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:23,080
Um... yeah,

1289
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:25,760
I did, and...

1290
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:26,840
Oh, crap,

1291
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,160
What's the matter?

1292
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:29,880
Uh, some perv's been
checking out the house...

1293
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:31,720
and I think I see him,

1294
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:33,800
I think he's in a Jeep or something,

1295
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:34,920
Really?

1296
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:38,080
You want me to cruise by
and check it out?

1297
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:40,120
No, We're just
gonna call the cops,

1298
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:41,520
JOHN:
O-Okay,

1299
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:43,920
Well, I'll-I'll talk to you later then,

1300
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:45,520
Shit,

1301
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:56,920
We figured if we'd hit stalking potential...

1302
00:55:57,080 --> 00:56:00,040
it was time to letJohn
take me out on a real date,

1303
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:03,000
What?
We're not eating here?

1304
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:05,520
Nah, I thought
we'd do take-out,

1305
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:12,040
Wait, where are we going?

1306
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:14,520
Well, I could tell you...

1307
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:16,800
but then I'd have to kill you,

1308
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:19,920
- Come on,

1309
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:22,120
There's our table,

1310
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:25,000
Oh, my gosh,

1311
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:26,920
Where are they?

1312
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:28,200
Where'd they go?

1313
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:29,640
Wait,

1314
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:33,280
You guys...

1315
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:35,000
I can't tell where they are,

1316
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:42,320
Okay, it's...... it's definitely dark,

1317
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:43,520
What?

1318
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:44,800
I don't know,
Outside, maybe?

1319
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:48,520
No effin' way!

1320
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:51,520
Boat? Has anybody else
been on the boat?

1321
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:53,520
I've never been on the boat,

1322
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:57,120
Nobody even told me he had a boat!

1323
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:58,760
She's not equipped
to handle this,

1324
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:00,120
- Huh,

1325
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:01,320
I'm losing them,

1326
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:04,120
I'm losing them! Hey!

1327
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:05,920
Oh,John,

1328
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:07,440
I'm serious,
-Stop it,

1329
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:08,840
We've gotta get out there,

1330
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:12,000
Come on!

1331
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:13,720
We've gotta get there now-ish,

1332
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:15,560
I can't! This motor sucks,

1333
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:18,640
- Can't you go a little faster?
- No,

1334
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:20,760
Give me an oar,
I could paddle faster than you!

1335
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:23,080
Just pretend
it's a whaling ship and...

1336
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,720
go Greenpeace on their asses!

1337
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:26,000
BETH:
What?

1338
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:27,160
- Hey! Hey!

1339
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:31,680
Nice, Gilligan here
just flooded the engine,

1340
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:33,040
I'll give you ''Gilligan,''

1341
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:35,600
- Heather, Heather, stop it!
- Stop! Stop it! That's wet!

1342
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:37,560
You have no idea
what you're doing, Heather!

1343
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:39,040
Wait,

1344
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:46,000
Okay, This is fine,

1345
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:48,120
This is why God
invented Triple-A,

1346
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:51,040
Oh, no,

1347
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:52,320
What?

1348
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:53,720
No signal,

1349
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:56,400
What?

1350
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:58,840
No signal?

1351
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:10,520
It was the first time
I was truly alone with John,

1352
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:12,200
I can't quite explain it, but...

1353
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:14,920
Okay, if I could dream
ofhow a date should be...

1354
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:16,000
Now make a wish,

1355
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:18,400
KATE:
,,John Tucker did it better,

1356
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:19,480
He did it way better,

1357
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:21,040
I mean, when do you cue
the dolphins?

1358
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:22,320
Right,

1359
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:24,120
I mean, no-no-no-no,
don't get me wrong,

1360
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:26,760
It's... It's really nice, but...

1361
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:28,480
are you really that scared...

1362
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:30,840
to just hang out
and be yourself?

1363
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:36,560
Okay, Fair enough,

1364
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:40,520
But it is terrifying,
trying to impress you,

1365
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:42,120
Me?

1366
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:43,760
Kate, I mean...

1367
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:45,040
you come out of nowhere...

1368
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,920
and you've got
high school dialed in,

1369
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:50,880
I don't really think I'm that dialed,

1370
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,520
No, uh, you're
the varsity captain...

1371
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:55,520
and the most popular guy
in school, yeah?

1372
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:59,040
Right, right, right, yeah, um, I guess,

1373
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:00,400
You know, I'm-I'm just lucky,

1374
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:01,880
Okay...

1375
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,920
I'm really lucky,

1376
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:06,080
Yeah, and-and-and
that's why I'd be crazy...

1377
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:07,600
not to make the most of it,

1378
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:11,120
Look, Kate...

1379
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:14,760
Maybe sometimes
I come on too strong,

1380
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:17,480
I don't know who else to be,

1381
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:21,360
You know, I just gotta put
my whole heart into things,

1382
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:26,840
That sounds like an easy way
to get it broken,

1383
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:33,080
Well... luckily, I...
figured out a way...

1384
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:35,760
to protect myself against that,

1385
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:38,120
Some kick-ass dance moves,

1386
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:40,160
What?

1387
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:43,080
- Wha...? Oh, my gosh!

1388
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,160
I wasn't ready for that,

1389
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:45,840
I was thinking about going pro,

1390
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:47,800
- Oh?
- Laugh all you want,

1391
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:49,200
There was a scout in the stands...

1392
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:50,320
at last year's prom,

1393
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:52,960
Wow,

1394
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:10,760
Oh, my gosh, spill it,

1395
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:13,280
We need to know everything,
Every detail right now,

1396
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:18,240
I... You- I mean, you-you guys
dated him, You know,

1397
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:19,800
Not on the high seas,

1398
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:22,160
What the hell happened out there?

1399
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:24,680
Um...nothing, you know?
It was just-We... We talked...

1400
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:26,040
and it was...

1401
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,040
It was nice,

1402
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:29,160
BETH:
You just talked?

1403
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:32,800
You mean, he was able to...
get intimate without being...

1404
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:34,720
like... intimate?

1405
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:38,080
Okay,

1406
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,880
He is telling her anything
she wants to hear,

1407
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
Look, the only way to see
if he's really fallen for her...

1408
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:43,520
is to see how far
Kate can push him...

1409
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:45,560
at the hotel after the away game,

1410
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:48,920
Right,
Yeah, I-I... I can do that,

1411
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:53,120
Oh, no, Oh, no,
I know that look,

1412
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:56,000
He's got you under his spell,

1413
01:00:56,120 --> 01:00:58,840
What? No! I-I...
Come on,

1414
01:00:59,000 --> 01:00:59,960
No, you come on,

1415
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:02,920
You can't lose focus
going into the finals,

1416
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:04,920
Kate, we all believed him...

1417
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:09,720
but there is no way to know what
this guy is really thinking,

1418
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:13,760
Yes, there is,

1419
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:16,320
I'm reporting from behind enemy lines...

1420
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:19,080
a fortress, if you will,
where the innermost workings...

1421
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:20,840
of the male psyche
reveal themselves...

1422
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:22,240
like a slide under a microscope,

1423
01:01:22,360 --> 01:01:24,160
- Good practice, Good practice!

1424
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:25,320
JOHN:
Central is going down!

1425
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:26,640
Get down!

1426
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:36,040
That's disgusting,

1427
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,400
Hey, look, Ma! No hands!

1428
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:45,160
Disgusting, Nice work,

1429
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:48,560
- Oh! Tommy! Nachos?
- Damn!

1430
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:50,200
I think it was nachos,

1431
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:52,160
Holy guacamole,

1432
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:54,600
Away game, dude,
You gonna be my wingman?

1433
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:56,400
Naw, I think I'm just gonna
hang out with Kate tonight,

1434
01:01:56,520 --> 01:01:57,640
Aw, come on,
So I gotta take care...

1435
01:01:57,760 --> 01:01:59,000
of all that Central High tail by myself?

1436
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:00,480
- Guess so,
- Ah, come on, man!

1437
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:01,520
We gonna get us some girls...

1438
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:02,760
or are you gonna act like one?

1439
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:06,280
That's messed up, Tommy,

1440
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:08,680
John, Please, please tell me...

1441
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:10,160
you tapped that by now!

1442
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:14,160
Boys, Boys, Look...

1443
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:16,040
you don't just pop
an '82 Bordeaux...

1444
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:17,640
'cause it's on your shelf,

1445
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:19,160
Oh, please,

1446
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:21,120
Great things take time,

1447
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:22,760
Man, you whipped!

1448
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:26,200
- Whipped, man!

1449
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:28,120
Hey! Hey!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

1450
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:30,800
Nobody is whipped, okay?
John Tucker is not whipped,

1451
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:32,400
Oh, here we go,

1452
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:34,560
Let's just say,
at tonight's away game...

1453
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:36,040
I'm gonna be scoring
more than baskets,

1454
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:38,840
Bingo,

1455
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:40,760
Okay, okay, Uncork it,
then pork it,

1456
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:42,720
- Now that's my man!
- Slam-dunk, baby,

1457
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:45,480
TEAMMATES

1458
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:47,760
We are so gonna get him,

1459
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:59,880
So, hydrogen and oxygen
are getting a drink...

1460
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:02,040
and gold walks in
and they go...

1461
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,800
''AU! Get outta the bar!''

1462
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:07,080
'Cause, you know, AU is...

1463
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:08,760
the atomic symbol for gold,

1464
01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:09,800
Yeah, Yeah,
I-I got it,

1465
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:11,880
Oh, good,

1466
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:16,040
You're gonna help me measure
with the doodad and everything,

1467
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:20,840
Oh, I actually thought
I'd work with Alex today,

1468
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Oh, I... Well, he's
gonna take you back...

1469
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:26,280
without an insurance waiver?

1470
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:28,560
Yeah, well,
he's warmed up to me...

1471
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:31,120
since his left eyebrow grew back,

1472
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:34,960
Uh...

1473
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:44,440
Hey, kiddo,
Is your mom home?

1474
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:46,480
Nope,

1475
01:03:48,280 --> 01:03:49,720
Is that him?

1476
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:52,320
You're not seriously
going out with Skip, are you?

1477
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:54,640
Don't call him that,

1478
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:57,160
We're just going out,

1479
01:03:57,080 --> 01:03:59,120
Mom, please don't do this,

1480
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:00,120
- Please?

1481
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:02,120
He's probably in town
for a layover...

1482
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:04,960
and he's just looking
for someone to lay over,

1483
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:07,440
Very clever, sweetheart,

1484
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:09,240
Can we not do this
whole thing right now?

1485
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:11,080
Mom, no wonder I'm so messed up,

1486
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,160
I've never actually seen
a functional relationship,

1487
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:14,680
Who I date...

1488
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:16,160
is none of your business,

1489
01:04:16,280 --> 01:04:17,640
Are you serious?

1490
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:20,720
Can you imagine growing up
with a mom who only dates jerks?

1491
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:24,000
You don't really see
how this affects me?

1492
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:29,480
See you tomorrow,

1493
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:32,640
Don't forget to lock the door
when you sneak out,

1494
01:04:39,080 --> 01:04:42,120
So,your team's just won
the semifinals...

1495
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:44,000
you're at a hotel
with all your friends...

1496
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:46,120
I mean, this should be fun,
shouldn't it?

1497
01:04:46,040 --> 01:04:47,760
CARRI E:
Come on,! Get up,!

1498
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:49,160
Let's go,

1499
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:52,000
Now the real game begins,

1500
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:54,280
Are you sure we're
not going too far?

1501
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:55,880
HEATHER:
Look...

1502
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,160
this game's in crunch time,

1503
01:04:57,320 --> 01:05:00,000
Kate, do you know what happens
when you let your guard down...

1504
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:01,480
around John Tucker?

1505
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:04,640
Carrie, show her,

1506
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:07,000
You need to see this,

1507
01:05:07,120 --> 01:05:09,600
Here,


1509
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
- Man, you whipped, man!
- Whipped!

1510
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:15,040
- Hold up! Hold up,
- All right, What? What?

1511
01:05:15,160 --> 01:05:16,120
I am not whipped, okay?

1512
01:05:16,040 --> 01:05:18,320
John Tucker is not whipped,

1513
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:22,160
I will have you know
that at tonight's away game...

1514
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:24,240
I'm gonna be scoring more than baskets,

1515
01:05:24,360 --> 01:05:25,720
TOMMY:
Uncork it, then pork it,

1516
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:27,960
- Okay, I got you on that one!
- Slam-dunk, baby,

1517
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:32,720
John Tucker, you are going down,

1518
01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:49,640
What? Is it okay?

1519
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:52,160
You should totally wear
underwear to school,

1520
01:05:52,280 --> 01:05:54,080
- She's hot!
- Yeah, you, girl!

1521
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:00,960
TOMMY:
''Kate S, requests...

1522
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:03,000
video chat with John T''?

1523
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:07,000
Okay, you're gone,

1524
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:09,680
- All right! Playa-playa!
- Come on, Tommy, Up,

1525
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:13,600
- Bye-bye,
- Fabio, Ow,

1526
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:15,640
- Hey, there,

1527
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:18,000
Hey, You alone?

1528
01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:20,000
Yeah, You?

1529
01:06:20,120 --> 01:06:22,920
Yeah, It's so sad...
'cause I'm s...

1530
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:25,360
I'm so... lovely,

1531
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:26,560
No!

1532
01:06:26,680 --> 01:06:28,400
- Lonely!

1533
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:30,160
I'm so lonely,

1534
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:32,400
JOHN:
Well, maybe I could...

1535
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:35,240
come over there
and keep you company,

1536
01:06:35,360 --> 01:06:37,880
Oh, I'd like that...
but there's a problem,

1537
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:39,600
Coach Williams is out in the hall,

1538
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:41,240
- She's totally watching,

1539
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:43,080
There's no way
you could get in here,

1540
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:44,320
- Damn it,
- Unless...

1541
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:46,000
you went out on the ledge...

1542
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:48,080
and came in
through the sliding door?

1543
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:50,480
Yeah, right,

1544
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:51,840
Yeah, that's crazy,

1545
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:55,360
It's too bad,
I got all... dressed up,

1546
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:59,680
Or... down,

1547
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:03,320
I-I could try the balcony,

1548
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:05,560
Great!
I'm three rooms down,

1549
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:06,840
I already counted,

1550
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:08,160
I'll be right there,

1551
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:09,240
Hold-Hold on!

1552
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:10,520
Uh, hold on,

1553
01:07:10,680 --> 01:07:11,840
What?

1554
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:12,960
Um...

1555
01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:16,040
I... got you a present?

1556
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:17,760
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah,

1557
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:20,000
It's... under your bed,

1558
01:07:27,840 --> 01:07:30,560
Ooh, A little preview?

1559
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:32,520
KATE:
N-No,

1560
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:34,400
I want you to wear them,

1561
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:37,000
What's wrong?

1562
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:40,520
It's sexy, Haven't you
ever done this before?

1563
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:41,680
No,

1564
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:43,520
That's cute,

1565
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:46,160
You're just so...
...inexperienced,

1566
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:47,640
What?

1567
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:50,080
No, I am not inexperienced,

1568
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,000
John...

1569
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:52,280
Johnny, I thought
that you might do this...

1570
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:53,600
Johnny, I thought
that you might do this...

1571
01:07:53,720 --> 01:07:55,480
one little thing for me,

1572
01:07:55,600 --> 01:08:00,760
And then... I might do a little
something for you,

1573
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:05,760
And then... we might do a little
something together,

1574
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:09,000
But...

1575
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:13,840
You know what? I am tired...

1576
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:16,240
...and it is getting
really late, so...

1577
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:19,040
I'll just see you tomorrow,

1578
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:21,160
- Night,
- Wait,

1579
01:08:22,360 --> 01:08:26,360
Wait, Um...
Give me five minutes,

1580
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:28,120
Okay,

1581
01:09:09,320 --> 01:09:12,120
-You...!
- I'm sorry!

1582
01:09:12,240 --> 01:09:13,320
...little...!

1583
01:09:13,480 --> 01:09:15,400
- March!
- Ow!

1584
01:09:18,240 --> 01:09:19,440
- Ow!
- Ooh!John!

1585
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:21,760
- What are you wearing?
- Dude, those are for ladies,

1586
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,160
What... the hell?

1587
01:09:25,280 --> 01:09:28,200
I think this belongs to you, Coach,

1588
01:09:28,320 --> 01:09:30,080
I found it in my bed,

1589
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:32,080
Coach, make her let go,

1590
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:33,280
Let go,

1591
01:09:35,400 --> 01:09:38,760
''Live and let live''
is what I say, Tucker,

1592
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:42,320
Takes all kinds to build a freeway,

1593
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:45,000
But I am not equipped...

1594
01:09:45,160 --> 01:09:47,040
for this kind of weirdness...

1595
01:09:47,160 --> 01:09:49,440
this close to the playoffs!

1596
01:09:57,560 --> 01:10:01,440
I guess it was
four instead of three, Sorry,

1597
01:10:01,560 --> 01:10:03,000
Show's over, ladies,

1598
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:04,160
Back to your rooms,

1599
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:08,080
Show's over!
Back to your rooms,

1600
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:10,120
- Hey,John!

1601
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:11,480
Love the bow,

1602
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:14,840
Your butt is my screensaver,

1603
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,080
There he is,

1604
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:20,560
Hey, Tucker!

1605
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:33,800
All right, let's go!

1606
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:36,800
Split up, shirts versus skins,
Come on,

1607
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:44,640
All right, Ball,

1608
01:10:44,760 --> 01:10:46,880
Dude, you wearing
thongs again, man?

1609
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:51,120
Yup,

1610
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:01,240
It's like letting your best
friend sleep in a silk hammock,

1611
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:04,120
They're breezy,

1612
01:11:04,040 --> 01:11:06,120
They don't bind,

1613
01:11:06,040 --> 01:11:08,360
And they give you
just enough swing,

1614
01:11:16,720 --> 01:11:19,040
What?

1615
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:26,360
All right, guys, let's go!

1616
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:42,960
Un...believable,

1617
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:44,320
I'd hit him with my car...

1618
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:47,480
if he wouldn't make a body cast
a fashion statement,

1619
01:11:53,080 --> 01:11:54,840
Kate!

1620
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:59,560
Hey, The other night didn't
quite go like I'd hoped,

1621
01:11:59,680 --> 01:12:02,080
Yeah, I know, Sorry,

1622
01:12:02,240 --> 01:12:05,160
Nah, it's okay,
Kind of spun it,

1623
01:12:05,080 --> 01:12:08,000
I noticed, Now everyone knows
Victoria's secret,

1624
01:12:08,120 --> 01:12:11,600
Tommy was thinking
we'd do it as a birthday theme,

1625
01:12:11,720 --> 01:12:13,640
''Not the Same Old
Thong and Dance,''

1626
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:15,600
Cute,

1627
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:19,200
Kate, Kate, wait,
Wait, wait,

1628
01:12:19,320 --> 01:12:22,320
Look...
you don't get it, Okay?

1629
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:25,520
I was humiliated trying
to get your attention...

1630
01:12:25,680 --> 01:12:29,880
and I'm not working this hard
just so I can get some action,

1631
01:12:30,040 --> 01:12:31,680
So I'm not just some
'82 Bordeaux...

1632
01:12:31,800 --> 01:12:33,160
you wanna
''uncork and pork''?

1633
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:35,120
Where'd you hear that?

1634
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:37,280
No-No-No, look-look,
that-that's just...

1635
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:40,080
locker room talk, okay?
That doesn't mean anything,

1636
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:42,840
You act like a pig
so you don't sound whipped?

1637
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:44,080
Yes, Exactly,

1638
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,280
Look, I'm... I'm saying
things I don't believe,

1639
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:48,080
I'm doing things
I don't understand,

1640
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:51,160
I mean, I put on your underwear
and I scaled a building,

1641
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:56,840
I'm trying so hard,

1642
01:12:56,960 --> 01:12:58,880
But I'm out of plays,

1643
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:03,320
Kate... you're the one,

1644
01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:10,400
Look, I've... never
done this before, so...

1645
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:12,760
I'm not exactly sure how it goes,

1646
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:15,880
It's just something personal,

1647
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:19,120
Okay? Something to show you...

1648
01:13:19,240 --> 01:13:23,360
and whoever wants to know,
that I'm whipped,

1649
01:13:23,480 --> 01:13:25,000
Excellent!

1650
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:29,520
Yeah, I'm whipped,

1651
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:33,120
Will you be my girlfriend?

1652
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:36,560
Oh... my...

1653
01:13:36,680 --> 01:13:38,120
God,

1654
01:13:38,040 --> 01:13:39,400
We'll crush him,

1655
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:42,120
Kill time, Bam!

1656
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:44,280
Happy birthday, little Tucker,

1657
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:45,760
CARRI E:
Okay, so, now we...

1658
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:49,000
Um... y-you guys...

1659
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:50,880
I'm feeling a little weird
about this whole thing,

1660
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:52,560
Huh?

1661
01:13:52,680 --> 01:13:54,080
- Kate...

1662
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:57,000
You said if you ever dated a guy like this...

1663
01:13:57,120 --> 01:13:58,840
you would get even,

1664
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:03,440
I know, um, but...

1665
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:05,000
Oh, my God, you love him!

1666
01:14:05,160 --> 01:14:07,120
Oh, we are doing
a dating intervention,

1667
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:08,400
This is for your own good,

1668
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:09,840
Reality check, Kate:

1669
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,440
you're not really dating him,

1670
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:12,560
You got Tucked over,

1671
01:14:12,720 --> 01:14:13,880
He didn't fall for you,

1672
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,800
He fell for what we made you,

1673
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:18,040
Who were you before you met us?

1674
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:20,440
No one... and then
we made you ''the one''...

1675
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:22,280
and this is how you repay us?

1676
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:25,720
So, the little monster you
created destroys John Tucker...

1677
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:27,800
and then what?
What happens to me?

1678
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:29,400
- You become a legend!
- Yeah!

1679
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:31,640
- What if I don't want that?
- Well, you can't have him!

1680
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:34,080
And... this watch
belongs to me!

1681
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:35,920
I'm the head cheerleader,
He's the team captain,

1682
01:14:36,040 --> 01:14:37,000
This watch should be mine!

1683
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:39,120
What, you think because
you're the head cheerleader...

1684
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:40,440
you can get whatever you want?

1685
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:42,880
- Exactly!
- Hey! Girls! Stop,

1686
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:44,080
Thanks, Carrie,

1687
01:14:44,240 --> 01:14:45,680
He deserves the best, okay?

1688
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:47,160
He obviously deserves me,

1689
01:14:47,080 --> 01:14:48,240
- What?!
- Please,

1690
01:14:48,360 --> 01:14:49,800
You don't care about him,

1691
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:51,640
All you care about is
getting into Hartford,

1692
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:53,160
I believe it's ''Har-vard,''

1693
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:55,840
Stop it, You guys,
we're supposed to be friends,

1694
01:14:55,960 --> 01:14:58,400
Well, friends don't say they're
gonna do something and then...

1695
01:14:58,520 --> 01:15:00,080
And then totally screw
everybody over!

1696
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,680
If you're not againstJohn,
you are not with us,

1697
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:08,760
You guys really think
this is gonna help you...

1698
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:10,080
get overJohn Tucker?

1699
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:12,520
You're either obsessed
with destroying him...

1700
01:15:12,680 --> 01:15:14,120
or obsessed with dating him,

1701
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:17,400
Either way,
it's always all about him,

1702
01:15:17,560 --> 01:15:19,040
I'm done with it,

1703
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:23,000
Well, cheerleaders don't quit,

1704
01:15:23,160 --> 01:15:25,160
I'm not a real cheerleader,

1705
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:28,480
Whatever your plan is,
count me out,

1706
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:30,240
Well, don't worry about it...

1707
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:32,760
because you're fired!

1708
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:34,080
But...

1709
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,520
Okay,

1710
01:15:35,640 --> 01:15:37,280
Hang on,

1711
01:15:37,400 --> 01:15:39,040
I think I know what we need,

1712
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:08,520
I wish it couldjust be simple,
like a retro pop song,

1713
01:16:10,120 --> 01:16:13,520
Boom, end of story,
we all live happily ever after,

1714
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:15,680
That's a nice watch,

1715
01:16:15,800 --> 01:16:17,360
No, it's-it's not
what it looks like,

1716
01:16:17,480 --> 01:16:20,360
But it's never really
like that, is it?

1717
01:16:20,520 --> 01:16:23,120
Since when are Beth and Carrie
friends with Heather?

1718
01:16:23,080 --> 01:16:25,760
Those girls absolutely
hate each other, Kate,

1719
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:28,320
And what are they
doing talking to you?

1720
01:16:31,160 --> 01:16:32,560
What happened to you?

1721
01:16:32,680 --> 01:16:34,800
You were so different,
and now you're like...

1722
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:37,280
the rest of them-
you fell for my brother,

1723
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:38,480
No, I-I didn't,

1724
01:16:38,600 --> 01:16:40,560
No, it's-it's not like that,
I mean...

1725
01:16:40,680 --> 01:16:42,440
It's something you cooked
up with those three,

1726
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:44,000
It's just a joke to you, isn't it?

1727
01:16:47,680 --> 01:16:50,000
You want to know
whyJohn fell for you?

1728
01:16:50,120 --> 01:16:52,080
He thinks that you're the first...

1729
01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:53,840
honest relationship
that he's been in,

1730
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,120
Well, he's not that innocent, okay?

1731
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:58,040
I mean, y-you know
how John Tucker can be,

1732
01:16:58,200 --> 01:17:00,560
Everybody knows how he can be,
He is John Tucker,

1733
01:17:00,680 --> 01:17:02,080
And still, every girl
in school lines up...

1734
01:17:02,240 --> 01:17:03,640
to date him,
knowing what they know,

1735
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:07,400
And yeah, he lies to girls
to get them to fall for him,

1736
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:10,640
I can't imagine the kind
of person who would do that,

1737
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:13,000
Can you?

1738
01:17:29,880 --> 01:17:31,800
Mom! The frosting!

1739
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:33,880
There's cake under it,

1740
01:17:34,040 --> 01:17:36,360
Yeah, I sent Skip home,

1741
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:41,000
Oh,

1742
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:45,920
You know, I'm starting to get
this whole ''Skip'' thing,

1743
01:17:46,040 --> 01:17:48,120
Look, I know my...

1744
01:17:48,240 --> 01:17:50,280
relationship stuff affects you,

1745
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:52,480
I made mistakes,

1746
01:17:52,600 --> 01:17:55,440
But I would never plan
to hurt somebody,

1747
01:17:55,560 --> 01:17:57,040
I-I'm just...

1748
01:17:57,160 --> 01:18:00,200
I just got so caught up in it,

1749
01:18:00,360 --> 01:18:02,320
I guess...

1750
01:18:02,480 --> 01:18:06,000
I was invisible for so long that...

1751
01:18:06,160 --> 01:18:07,840
it felt good to be noticed,

1752
01:18:07,960 --> 01:18:09,040
Kate...

1753
01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:10,920
you chose to be invisible,

1754
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:13,920
You thought it would
be easier that way,

1755
01:18:14,040 --> 01:18:16,400
Well, they're
noticing me now,

1756
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:20,160
I mean, none of this is really me,

1757
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:23,960
And-and now I don't even know
who my real friends really are,

1758
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:27,040
Maybe if you showed them
the real Kate, you'd find out,

1759
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
- Hey, happy birthday, bro,
- Scrappy,

1760
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:01,040
Hey, have you seen Tommy?

1761
01:19:01,160 --> 01:19:03,000
We have a birthday
present forJohn,

1762
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:05,160
Yeah, he's on stage, in the truck,

1763
01:19:07,960 --> 01:19:11,520
We 'bout to thump up in here!

1764
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:18,080
People in Planes,
Yeah, that was loud right there!

1765
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:19,040
Hey, look, check me out over here,

1766
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:20,720
Come on, now, gather round,

1767
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:23,560
It's John Tucker toast time! Yeah!

1768
01:19:23,680 --> 01:19:25,960
Hey,John, come up here, man!

1769
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:27,600
All right, look,
check this out,

1770
01:19:27,720 --> 01:19:29,240
A birthday comes
but once a year...

1771
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:31,160
and the good Lord
you'll be thanking,

1772
01:19:31,280 --> 01:19:33,640
Now, old pal,
let's cut this cake...

1773
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:35,160
and see who's giving you...

1774
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:40,120
- a... spanking! Ho-ho-ho!

1775
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:46,040
- Tommy! Tommy, hey!
- What's up? Whatcha got for me?

1776
01:19:46,160 --> 01:19:48,640
Oh,just a little something
extra from the girls at Kodiak,

1777
01:19:48,760 --> 01:19:50,080
Me likey,
I'm gonna start it right now,

1778
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:52,480
- Okay, perfect, Here we go,

1779
01:19:58,160 --> 01:19:59,800
That was hot!

1780
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:02,000
- He's got mad skills!
- Now take a look at hotter!

1781
01:20:02,120 --> 01:20:04,040
Boy can slam!

1782
01:20:04,160 --> 01:20:07,160
Move on back
'cause Tuck's our man!

1783
01:20:07,080 --> 01:20:09,120
We love you,John!

1784
01:20:09,240 --> 01:20:10,640
Happy birthday,John!

1785
01:20:10,760 --> 01:20:14,000
- Everyone in the Poetry Club...
-Kate!

1786
01:20:14,160 --> 01:20:15,840
You made it, Come on,

1787
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,560
Come wish me a happy birthday,

1788
01:20:18,720 --> 01:20:21,000
John, that's not why I'm here,

1789
01:20:23,160 --> 01:20:25,880
o, Kate...

1790
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:29,040
this is just something
to show you and...

1791
01:20:29,160 --> 01:20:31,880
whoever wants to know,
that I'm whipped,

1792
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
- You're the one, Kate,
-  Aw...

1793
01:20:34,120 --> 01:20:35,040
Look, I've never done this
before, so...

1794
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:36,400
Look, I've never done this
before, so...

1795
01:20:36,520 --> 01:20:38,040
This is cool,

1796
01:20:38,160 --> 01:20:40,320
...I'm not exactly sure how it goes,

1797
01:20:40,440 --> 01:20:42,040
Will you be my girlfriend?

1798
01:20:42,160 --> 01:20:44,120
Oh, yeah!

1799
01:20:44,240 --> 01:20:46,720
John Tucker,
there's only one guy out there...

1800
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:47,880
- for me...
- Oh, no!

1801
01:20:48,040 --> 01:20:49,120
but you are not...

1802
01:20:54,080 --> 01:20:55,800
What's going on?

1803
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:58,000
Um...

1804
01:20:58,120 --> 01:21:00,840
John, I have something I have to say,

1805
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:02,120
This entire time...

1806
01:21:02,240 --> 01:21:04,720
I've been pretending to be
a bunch of stuff that I'm not...

1807
01:21:04,840 --> 01:21:07,880
so you would... fall for me,

1808
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,080
- Louder!
- What's the deal?!

1809
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:13,000
We were trying to break your heart...

1810
01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:14,800
so you knew what it felt like,

1811
01:21:14,920 --> 01:21:16,160
''We''?

1812
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:20,840
I get it,

1813
01:21:22,120 --> 01:21:23,960
Well, hey...

1814
01:21:24,120 --> 01:21:26,960
you girls pulled it off,

1815
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:29,440
Yeah,

1816
01:21:29,560 --> 01:21:31,120
It worked,

1817
01:21:32,840 --> 01:21:34,400
I'm sorry,

1818
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:37,720
- What's the deal?!
- What's going on?!

1819
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:38,760
You guys breaking up?

1820
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:42,400
Look, this entire time,
I've been...

1821
01:21:42,520 --> 01:21:45,520
I've been lying about who I am,

1822
01:21:45,640 --> 01:21:48,200
But... I'm done pretending,

1823
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:51,160
This is the real me,

1824
01:21:51,080 --> 01:21:53,800
This is Kate,

1825
01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:57,800
- Hey, Kate!
- Yeah?

1826
01:21:59,360 --> 01:22:00,480
You're ruining the party!

1827
01:22:02,840 --> 01:22:04,320
- That is so not fair,
- Oh, no!

1828
01:22:04,440 --> 01:22:06,920
This is all our fault,
You do not deserve this,

1829
01:22:07,040 --> 01:22:08,720
We should never
have done this to you,

1830
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:11,680
Give me that,
Okay, Hey!

1831
01:22:11,800 --> 01:22:13,200
So big deal, she lied,

1832
01:22:13,320 --> 01:22:14,760
We all lied,

1833
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:16,400
What, like you've
never lied before?

1834
01:22:16,520 --> 01:22:18,800
Exactly, You should be
throwing drinks at each other...

1835
01:22:18,920 --> 01:22:21,160
- Yeah,
- not her,

1836
01:22:24,080 --> 01:22:25,120
Everybody chill,

1837
01:22:25,240 --> 01:22:27,720
Look... they're right,

1838
01:22:27,880 --> 01:22:29,320
All right, we all do it,

1839
01:22:29,480 --> 01:22:30,720
I lie,

1840
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:33,200
I pretend I'm whatever
I need to to get girls,

1841
01:22:33,320 --> 01:22:34,520
And it works, dude!

1842
01:22:34,640 --> 01:22:36,080
You're the man!

1843
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,160
Naw, I'm not saying
it's a good thing,

1844
01:22:38,280 --> 01:22:39,800
- It's a great thing!
-Guys...

1845
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:42,040
what I'm trying to say is...

1846
01:22:42,160 --> 01:22:44,240
it's wrong,

1847
01:22:44,360 --> 01:22:46,440
There ain't nothin' wrong
with hookin' up...

1848
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:48,360
with the finest girls
in the school!

1849
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:50,040
- Yeah!

1850
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:55,360
Tucker! Tucker! Tucker! Tucker!

1851
01:22:55,480 --> 01:22:59,440
Tucker! Tucker! Tucker!
Tucker! Tucker! Tucker!

1852
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:00,760
Oh!

1853
01:23:29,360 --> 01:23:30,640
John!

1854
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:33,480
Hi,

1855
01:23:33,640 --> 01:23:35,240
- Hey,
- Hey,

1856
01:23:36,360 --> 01:23:40,040
Wow, you look... clean,

1857
01:23:41,560 --> 01:23:44,040
Thanks, You look
pretty clean yourself,

1858
01:23:44,160 --> 01:23:45,840
Thanks,

1859
01:23:45,960 --> 01:23:47,440
- Listen...

1860
01:23:47,560 --> 01:23:49,120
I shouldn't have
thrown the cake...

1861
01:23:49,040 --> 01:23:50,040
Kate, stop,

1862
01:23:50,160 --> 01:23:51,960
I deserved the cake
in the face,

1863
01:23:52,080 --> 01:23:54,320
And, as hard as it might be
for you to believe...

1864
01:23:54,440 --> 01:23:56,520
I'm gonna start telling the truth,

1865
01:23:58,040 --> 01:23:59,120
I mean it,

1866
01:23:59,040 --> 01:24:02,920
Okay, well, that...
I think that's great,

1867
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:06,080
So... truce?

1868
01:24:06,040 --> 01:24:08,160
I'd like that,

1869
01:24:08,080 --> 01:24:10,280
Ow!

1870
01:24:11,480 --> 01:24:13,120
I think you bobbed when I...

1871
01:24:13,080 --> 01:24:14,640
- Weaved, Yeah,
- Right,

1872
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:17,160
( laughs ):
Okay,

1873
01:24:17,080 --> 01:24:18,360
See you around,

1874
01:24:18,480 --> 01:24:20,480
Yeah, Good luck,

1875
01:24:26,120 --> 01:24:28,240
So, it took us
1 2 bottles of shampoo...

1876
01:24:28,360 --> 01:24:30,560
and three days to get
the stripper cake out of our hair,

1877
01:24:30,680 --> 01:24:31,920
But you know what?

1878
01:24:32,040 --> 01:24:34,000
- Kate,
- It was all worth it,

1879
01:24:34,120 --> 01:24:35,000
Hey, Kate,

1880
01:24:35,120 --> 01:24:37,960
Hey, um, uh, one sec,

1881
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:39,280
- Hi,
- Hey,

1882
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:40,720
So, uh...

1883
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:44,000
things didn't quite work out
with Alex and I,

1884
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:47,320
Um... see, we have shop
together, as well,

1885
01:24:47,440 --> 01:24:48,920
- Was there another fire?
- No,

1886
01:24:49,040 --> 01:24:51,800
No, I...
I clearly warned him...

1887
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:54,040
that I shouldn't be operating
a band saw,

1888
01:24:54,160 --> 01:24:55,120
No way,

1889
01:24:55,240 --> 01:24:58,080
Um...

1890
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:01,120
but Chemistry
does suck without you,

1891
01:25:01,240 --> 01:25:04,960
What do you say?
Lab partners?

1892
01:25:05,080 --> 01:25:06,600
Are you sure?

1893
01:25:06,720 --> 01:25:08,840
Yes, I'm sure,

1894
01:25:08,960 --> 01:25:10,960
You're perfect, Kate,

1895
01:25:12,080 --> 01:25:15,720
Um... you know,
'cause you're, uh...

1896
01:25:15,880 --> 01:25:17,920
smarter than me,
and so far, uh...

1897
01:25:18,080 --> 01:25:19,960
not flammable,

1898
01:25:20,080 --> 01:25:21,520
Right?

1899
01:25:21,680 --> 01:25:24,040
True,

1900
01:25:26,480 --> 01:25:28,160
You totally have a crush...

1901
01:25:28,280 --> 01:25:29,920
on the other Tucker,

1902
01:25:30,040 --> 01:25:32,000
She'll definitely need help
with this one,

1903
01:25:32,120 --> 01:25:33,960
I just upgraded my boob cam,

1904
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:36,160
- We can do a full-frontal attack,
- No,

1905
01:25:36,280 --> 01:25:39,080
No, Let's just
hang out tonight, okay?

1906
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:40,400
Hang out?

1907
01:25:40,520 --> 01:25:42,320
Where's that gonna go on
my college application?

1908
01:25:42,440 --> 01:25:42,800
And John Tucker?

1909
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:43,680
And John Tucker?

1910
01:25:43,800 --> 01:25:45,160
We definitely got to him,

1911
01:25:45,280 --> 01:25:46,920
He never lied to a girl again,

1912
01:25:47,080 --> 01:25:48,040
Hey, beautiful,

1913
01:25:48,200 --> 01:25:50,320
Now, we need to go into this
with our eyes open,

1914
01:25:50,480 --> 01:25:51,720
Complete honesty,

1915
01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:54,760
Jennifer, this is Jill...

1916
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:56,080
my other girlfriend,

1917
01:25:56,200 --> 01:25:58,880
I think we can make this work,

1918
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:02,880
And the girl who made
John Tucker fall in love?

1919
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,880
Well, she's a legend,

1920
01:26:11,920 --> 01:26:13,160
Oh,!

1921
01:26:13,080 --> 01:26:14,200
I almost forgot,

1922
01:26:14,320 --> 01:26:15,800
If you're thinking
of trying this at home...

1923
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:18,520
just remember; when you mess
with a John Tucker...

1924
01:26:18,640 --> 01:26:21,120
you better be prepared
for the consequences,

1925
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:07,000
Holy jama lama!
