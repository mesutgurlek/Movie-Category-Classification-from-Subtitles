1
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:48,150
"...just as Eliza
was majestically removing..."

2
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:52,831
"...a fifty-pound banknote
from the drawer to her own purse..."

3
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,716
"...we were suddenly interrupted
by old MacDonald himself!"

4
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,311
"We called up all the winning dignity
of our sex to do what must be done."

5
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,798
"Sophia shrieked and fainted, and
I screamed and instantly ran mad."

6
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:13,033
"Finally, we regained our senses,
escaped and hastened to London."

7
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:16,277
"We began to think
of returning to our mothers,"

8
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,870
"but accidentally heard
that they had both..."

9
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,799
"...starved to death!"

10
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,274
Fanny!

11
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,913
Goodbye, Susy.

12
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,874
Think of lots of good stories for me
and eat thousands of tarts.

13
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,676
And you, little girl, continue to brush
your hair, but not all off.

14
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,110
Fanny, he's here.

15
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,951
Wake up. Say goodbye to your sister.

16
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,436
- Sorry for the delay.
- Hurry along, then.

17
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,156
- Goodbye!
- Come on, I ain't got all day.

18
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,709
- Bye!
- Goodbye, Mama.

19
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,751
- Give my regards to my sisters.
- Yes, Mama.

20
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:11,350
And you will write to tell me
when I'm to return?

21
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,710
Mama?

22
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,433
Get on now!

23
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:18,598
- Bye!
- Bye, Susy!

24
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,358
Bye!

25
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,077
Bye!

26
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,716
Do you hear that?

27
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,592
Black cargo, Miss.

28
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:13,076
- Black cargo?
- Aye. Slaves.

29
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,192
Probably some captain
or heroic ship doctor...

30
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,034
...brought home some darkies
as gifts for the wife.

31
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,793
Get on there!

32
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,629
Whoa! Stand!

33
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,712
Hello!

34
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,472
- Hello!
- It's 5 o'clock in the morning.

35
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,992
A Mrs Norris arranged
for this girl to be brought here.

36
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:31,593
- It's her niece or something.
- Mrs Norris lives in the parsonage.

37
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,236
I was told to drop her
at the entrance of Mansfield Park.

38
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,396
Then drop her.

39
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,911
- You must be my aunt, Aunt Norris.
- Yes, yes...

40
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,112
He brought you two hours too early.

41
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,117
Come in.

42
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,713
Ellis, gather up the children.

43
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,673
Now, let us have a look at you.

44
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,958
Well...I'm sure
you have other qualities.

45
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,668
Sir Thomas, she's here.
Our new little charge.

46
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,996
- Hello, Fanny.
- Hello, Sir Thomas.

47
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:38,636
- Greetings from my family.
- Thank you. How was your journey?

48
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,434
Lovely, sir. I'd no idea
England was so big.

49
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:44,279
But you came, what?
A hundred miles?

50
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,950
- Yes, sir. Impressive.
- lndeed, it is.

51
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,950
Well, get her settled in with you,
and we'll introduce the children later.

52
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,515
With Mr Norris and myself?

53
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,712
- Yes...I thought...
- No, no, no.

54
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,751
There's been a misunderstanding.

55
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,270
When I suggested
we take in my poor niece...

56
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:07,358
Please do not trouble yourself
on my behalf.

57
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,952
You speak when you are spoken to.

58
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,310
Would you excuse us, Miss Price?

59
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,149
Good morning.
I am Maria Elizabeth Bertram.

60
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,592
And I am Julia Frances Bertram.
Pleased to make your acquaintance.

61
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,950
Pleased to meet you.

62
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,438
Mr Norris could no more tolerate
the noise of a child than he could fly!

63
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:25,474
But it might not be wise to have her
in the house with the boys.

64
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,959
If you breed her up with them, though
she may have the beauty of an angel,

65
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,196
she'll never be more to either
than a sister.

66
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:36,278
I suppose there's truth to that.
It's settled.

67
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:40,076
Maria, Julia, listen...

68
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:46,037
We must prepare ourselves
for gross ignorance,

69
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,074
some meanness of opinion
and a certain vulgarity of manner.

70
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:54,478
- These aren't incurable faults.
- I hope she won't tease my Pug.

71
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:58,355
I've just persuaded Julia
to leave him alone.

72
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,518
But you girls must never be
arrogant towards her.

73
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,711
She is not your equal.

74
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,593
But that must never
be apparent to her.

75
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,759
- It is a point of great delicacy.
- Great delicacy, yes.

76
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:16,832
Dining parlour through there.
Conservatory there. Cellars there.

77
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,153
I hope you don't tend toward sulkiness.
Your mother had the inclination.

78
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:25,432
Clearly marrying
to disoblige her family.

79
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,032
That's the west wing.

80
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,597
Soon to be repaired if Tom could
set aside his horses and dice!

81
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,796
The billiard room.
For the men, of course.

82
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,912
Remember there is moderation
in all things.

83
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,829
Yes... Tom did it of himself.

84
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,271
Very modern... Very modern...

85
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,919
Sir Thomas' extraordinary library.
Come along, we haven't got all day.

86
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,759
And here is Sir Thomas' study.

87
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,632
Never disturb him here.

88
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,559
He's weighed down
with some great cares.

89
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:01,035
This is his personal sanctuary.

90
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:04,391
The maids' rooms.
Manservants' rooms down there.

91
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,795
You will be my assistant,
you understand.

92
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,595
And here, what was formerly
the nursery and the governor's room,

93
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,679
is now your very own room!

94
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,990
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

95
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,236
How long am I expected
to remain here?

96
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,237
That depends, doesn't it?

97
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:33,238
But if all goes well...for ever.

98
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:58,789
"Dear Susy, it seems
that Mother has given me away. "

99
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,313
"And I can augur nothing but misery
from all I've seen at Mansfield Park. "

100
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,429
Don't worry. I'm all for crying.
It makes your hair grow.

101
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,359
Don't make fun of me.

102
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,559
Is it working?

103
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,228
- Is what working?
- My behaviour.

104
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:38,035
- Is it making you feel better?
- It's certainly distracting.

105
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,879
Good... Anyway, I'm Edmund.

106
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,472
So, who do you miss?

107
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,114
"I told Edmund
about you especially, Susy. "

108
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:50,790
"He asked me if I wished to write
to you. I said I had no paper. "

109
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,757
"And didn't he give me enough for more
stories than you should ever want!"

110
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:13,793
"By the way,
Eliza eloped to Paris with her lover."

111
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,878
"Unfortunately,
she lived beyond her means"

112
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:21,437
"and was imprisoned and partially
eaten by her two young sons."

113
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,108
"But she intends
to murder the guards."

114
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,074
"I'll keep you abreast
of any further developments."

115
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,114
"PS..."

116
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:36,713
"Could you please assure Mother
that I am improving myself daily?"

117
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,753
The history of England.

118
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,353
Henry Vl.

119
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,755
It was in this reign
that Joan of Arc lived

120
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,599
and made such a fuss
among the English.

121
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:53,156
They should not have burnt her,
but they did.

122
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,430
Henry Vlll...

123
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:59,757
I'll save you the task of hearing
what you've already heard,

124
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:04,192
and myself of recounting
what I do not perfectly recollect,

125
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,879
justice and duty...

126
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:09,755
That disgrace to humanity,
that pest of society, Elizabeth,

127
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,315
who, murderess and wicked queen
that she was,

128
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:16,672
confined her cousin, the lovely
Mary, Queen of Scots, for 1 9 years,

129
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:21,431
and then brought her to an untimely,
unmerited and scandalous death.

130
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:26,350
Much to the eternal shame of the
monarchy and the entire kingdom.

131
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:40,113
"By a partial, prejudiced
and ignorant historian."

132
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,232
- Fanny, you're awful!
- All those wars!

133
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,477
The men all good for nothing,
and hardly any women at all.

134
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,238
Very tiresome.

135
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:52,831
It's odd that history should be so dull.
A great deal of it must be invention.

136
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:58,194
I shall have to bend your supple mind
in more strict a fashion.

137
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:01,790
I think the situation calls for some...

138
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,991
...Shakespeare!

139
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,994
Fanny Price!
Please try to act with some decorum!

140
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,551
What?

141
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,151
What?

142
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,271
So you like her?

143
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,712
Mrs Shakespeare, she's my refuge.
I can't thank you enough.

144
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,751
My gifts are nothing next to yours.

145
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:24,032
My writing is wood
compared to your wild constructions.

146
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,279
Yes, I'm a wild beast!
I'm sure Sir Thomas would agree.

147
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:32,799
Don't concern yourself with his gravity.
He has much to preoccupy him.

148
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,195
Such as?

149
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,712
Edmund!

150
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,309
- It's complex.
- And I'm too simple?

151
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,794
Fanny!

152
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,912
He regrets taking me in, doesn't he?

153
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,917
No, it's...

154
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,675
It's just it's problems with the slaves
on the plantation.

155
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,839
- The abolitionists are making inroads.
- That's a good thing, isn't it?

156
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:02,270
Well, we all live off the profits, Fanny.

157
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,436
Including you.

158
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,552
Tom, you mustn't be serious!

159
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,156
Come back!

160
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,711
Tom!

161
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,039
You will do as I say!

162
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,276
What, and do as you do?

163
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:29,189
Even I have principles, sir!

164
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,837
Tom!

165
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,352
You are an angel.

166
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,039
Tom!

167
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,713
"Dear Susy,
news items... "

168
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:56,037
"Sir Thomas has dragged Tom
to the West lndies to..."

169
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,118
"...protect our interests there."

170
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:02,756
"Maria has found herself a fiance,
a Mr Rushworth, "

171
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,838
"who Sir Thomas
has approved by post. "

172
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:09,191
"Everyone seems delighted with him,
except Edmund, who says, "

173
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:13,837
"'If he had not £1 2,000 a year,
we'd think him prodigiously dim. "'

174
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:18,318
"Consequently, there's an urgency
for Julia to search for a suitor. "

175
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,394
"And Mrs Norris' husband died..."

176
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,639
"...which did not seem
to inconvenience her at all. "

177
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:30,470
"She's moved into Mansfield proper,
where life is decidedly less expensive."

178
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:33,911
"What joy is mine! So..."

179
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:39,433
"Now there is a new parson
moved into the parsonage, and... "

180
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:45,351
"...Iife seems nothing more than
a quick succession of busy nothings."

181
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,917
They are half-brother and -sister
to the parson's wife.

182
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,635
Entertain them with suitable
attention and animation.

183
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:55,354
Not to mention alacrity!

184
00:17:55,560 --> 00:18:00,111
I might need the rest of the morning
to recover from the ball last night.

185
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:04,632
- I'm just a mite sluggish.
- lndeed!

186
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:07,479
Mr Russel, if you please!

187
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:31,199
May I introduce Miss Mary Crawford?

188
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:39,871
And her brother, Mr Henry Crawford.

189
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,678
This is my sister, Lady Bertram.

190
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,678
Mr Edmund Bertram.

191
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,313
This is Miss Julia Bertram,
who's just come out into society,

192
00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:01,913
as Miss Maria Bertram, here, has just
become engaged to Mr Rushworth.

193
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:10,275
Perhaps you passed Mr Rushworth's
magnificent estate on your way.

194
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,153
The one with the spectacular gardens,
Sotherton?

195
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,318
Actually, we're planning
some improvements.

196
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,794
And Fanny Price.

197
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,913
Well...you certainly seem a dreary lot!

198
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:55,270
Please, do join us
in our game, Mr Crawford.

199
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:23,199
- Well...?
- I like them both exceedingly.

200
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,197
But I like Julia best.

201
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,799
Why?

202
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,310
Because her Aunt Norris advised me
that it must be so!

203
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,717
She seems very ready
to be fallen in love with.

204
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:36,354
Though Maria is most agreeable.

205
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:39,677
- Though her choice is made.
- Yes...

206
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,153
And I like her the better for it.

207
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,830
An engaged woman is always more
agreeable than a disengaged.

208
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:49,110
She is satisfied with herself.

209
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:52,756
Her cares are over, and she may exert
all her powers of pleasing

210
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,791
without suspicion.

211
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,754
All is safe with a lady engaged.
No harm can be done.

212
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,111
You allow yourself great latitude
on such points, Henry.

213
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,551
But you will be the one
taken in at last.

214
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,549
"'l cannot know
if he loves me,' said Eliza."

215
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:13,877
"l asked, 'Did he never gaze
on you with admiration?"'

216
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:20,076
"'Tenderly press your hand?
Drop a tear and leave abruptly?"'

217
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,952
"'Never,' replied she."

218
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:26,756
"'He's always left the room
when his visit has been ended."'

219
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,156
Edmund... What do you think?

220
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,555
She's delightful.

221
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:38,076
They're both delightful.

222
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:47,155
There could be no harm
in my liking an agreeable man.

223
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,272
- Everyone knows my situation.
- Must you always win?

224
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,516
Even when you already
have your prize?

225
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,551
There will be disappointments.

226
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:57,991
If one scheme of happiness fails...

227
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,112
...human nature turns to another.

228
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:08,799
You may need your pretty philosophy
in the end, Maria.

229
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,872
Pity Tom, the eldest, is not here.

230
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,719
Or his £20,000 and his baronetcy!

231
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:21,799
Henry! You know those things
mean nothing to me.

232
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,991
Shall we stay on a while?

233
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,191
Hmm, yes, please.

234
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:57,870
I must say, the pleasures of life rarely
transcend such a moment as this.

235
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,071
Don't you agree, Pugsie?

236
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,953
God damn you!

237
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:06,630
Tom, are you well?
Is there war? Where's Sir Thomas?

238
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,990
Edmund, come quickly!

239
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,757
Tom, what of Antigua?
Where's Father?

240
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:18,078
Antigua... All the lovely people there
paying for this party.

241
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,714
Tom, we thought you were in Antigua.

242
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,273
Oh, please!

243
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:27,758
Tom returned from Antigua
somewhat sooner than expected.

244
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:32,909
He spent a while in London. I found
him in the Covent Garden Theatre.

245
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,918
- A theatre?
- Yes. They're restaging this...

246
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:39,271
...delicious slice of naughtiness
called "Lovers' Vows".

247
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,152
I've heard of that.

248
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,193
Tom was a charming parasite until...

249
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,155
Well...he ran out of cash.

250
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:52,309
Since I sympathise with the tragedy
of unwarranted poverty,

251
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:57,389
I chose to deliver him to his family,
whom I now find to be so very...

252
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,991
...Ioving and beautiful.

253
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,519
And solvent.

254
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,270
Solvent?

255
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,831
Mr Bertram?

256
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,269
The baron meets the bastard son,
takes back his lover,

257
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:23,554
and they all live happily, I presume,
for some time ever after.

258
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,433
- Bravo, Tom!
- Well told, Tom!

259
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,595
More dim-witted fiction
to clutter the world.

260
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,597
Come now, Mr Bertram.

261
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:35,270
Drama is to life
what ships are to the sea.

262
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:39,519
A means to traverse it. To plumb
its depths, breadth and beauty.

263
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,517
I couldn't agree more.

264
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:45,235
Good drama, in which the greatest
powers of the mind are displayed,

265
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:50,195
in which the most thorough knowledge
of human nature, the liveliest wit,

266
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:54,075
are conveyed to the world
through the best chosen language.

267
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,952
This is essential.

268
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,515
This is trash!

269
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,796
He's so serious!

270
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,753
That is the worst charge, isn't it?

271
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:09,319
What do you think, Miss Price?

272
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:13,559
I'm sorry to disappoint,
but I do not have a ready opinion.

273
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:17,799
I suspect you are entirely composed
of ready opinions not shared.

274
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,513
Fanny.

275
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:23,474
- Yes, Aunt Norris?
- What are you doing here?

276
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:28,993
- I beg your pardon.
- The sewing wasn't cleared away.

277
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,637
You're quite right, it wasn't. I'll...

278
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:36,673
I'll see to it immediately.

279
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:43,155
Aunt Norris, surely
the sewing can wait?

280
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:58,715
Pray, is she out or is she not...
into society?

281
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:03,198
- I can't see that it matters terribly.
- Forget this nonsense.

282
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,391
Let's stage the play.

283
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,353
Here. Now. Together.

284
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:11,358
Yatesy, you're a genius.

285
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:15,599
Why, this is the very room
for a theatre.

286
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:21,033
And Father's study will
provide for an excellent stage!

287
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:27,194
It has been mentioned that I have
quite a gift for the stage...actually.

288
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,597
Tom, you're not serious?

289
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:33,314
Not serious? Me?

290
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:37,672
"Lover's Vows"? I'm convinced
that our father would disapprove.

291
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:40,599
I think I know our father
as well as you do.

292
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:44,554
Manage yourself and let me
take care of the rest of the family.

293
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:48,196
Don't act yourself if you
do not like it, but please...

294
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,755
...don't try to govern everybody else.

295
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,030
All settled, then?

296
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,993
- Good!
- What?

297
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:00,591
What's the matter?
I was not asleep.

298
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:04,190
No, of course not, ma'am.
No one suspected you.

299
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,470
Where's Fanny?

300
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:09,592
Mrs Norris, get me Fanny Price.

301
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,832
I wish to play Amelia.

302
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:18,558
But which gentleman am I to have
the pleasure of making love to?

303
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:24,554
Why has the wish to do what is right
become an unattractive quality?

304
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:28,275
And now Tom wants
Charles Maddox to play Anhalt.

305
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,995
He's about as discreet
as the town crier!

306
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:38,958
So this is where you hide. I need
some rehearsing. Would you mind...?

307
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,551
Mr Bertram! Hello.

308
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,719
Hello, Miss Crawford.

309
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:48,629
- I'll be off, then, Fanny.
- Stay, stay!

310
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:51,877
Stay! We need an audience.

311
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,992
We all need an audience,
don't we, Fanny?

312
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,270
I live in dread of audiences.

313
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,436
Come. I will play Amelia.

314
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:02,313
- And you will play Anhalt my teacher.
- No, no.

315
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:06,798
Read from there,
since Mr Bertram refuses. I insist.

316
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,790
Very well.

317
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:14,835
"For a long time,
you have instructed me."

318
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:20,636
- "Why should not I now teach you?"
- "Teach me what?"

319
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:24,150
"Whatever I know and you don't."

320
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:28,592
"There are some things
I'd rather never know."

321
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:33,157
"As you made certain mathematical
problems pleasant to me,"

322
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:37,273
"l might teach
something as pleasant to you."

323
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,914
"Woman herself is a problem."

324
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:43,192
"And I'll teach you to make her out."

325
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,197
"You teach?"

326
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,879
"Why not?"

327
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:51,471
"None but a woman can teach
the science of herself."

328
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:57,879
Upon reconsideration,
I cannot help but think that...

329
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,640
...despite the displeasure
of appearing inconsistent,

330
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:03,070
it would be better for me to play Anhalt

331
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:06,033
than invite Charles Maddox
into this mixture.

332
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,310
Excellent!

333
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,395
"There are some things
I would rather never know."

334
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:23,910
"What is this? How is this?"

335
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:29,677
"And why do I find
my mother thus? Speak."

336
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:32,519
"l cannot speak, my dear son."

337
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:35,871
"My dear Frederick,
I was not prepared."

338
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:39,831
"Dear Mother, compose yourself.
Now then..."

339
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,310
Put it down over there.

340
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,919
Hello, my sweet dear girl.

341
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,472
Welcome home, sir.

342
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:08,357
My word! You've grown in health.

343
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,790
And, I dare say, beauty.

344
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:15,157
Where are the rest, Julia and Maria?
What's that?

345
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,033
- Well, it's...
- lmprovements?

346
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,318
Baddeley.

347
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:34,913
Oh, you must be Sir Thomas!
I am Rushworth.

348
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:38,280
Your future son-in-law.

349
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:42,236
We are in the midst
of a home theatrical. I'm Count Cassel.

350
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:45,398
I come in with a blue dress
and a pink satin cloak...

351
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:50,628
...afterwards I have another fine suit
by way of a shooting dress.

352
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:54,196
I have two and forty speeches
which is...

353
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,356
...no trifle.

354
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,677
Father!

355
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:11,233
- Absolutely not!
- It won't be much.

356
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,237
Father...

357
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:21,791
Tom... So this is what you were
in such a hurry to leave Antigua for?

358
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,515
Oh, Sir Thomas...

359
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:37,589
I could not have borne
your absence a moment longer.

360
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,914
Come on!

361
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:02,950
"Dear Susy, all remnants
of the theatre have been erased, "

362
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:08,234
"and Tom and Yates have fled
the new solemnity that has returned. "

363
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,795
Do tell us more
about the Negroes, dear.

364
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,551
The mulattos are well-shaped, and
the women especially well-featured.

365
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:21,630
I have one, so easy and graceful in
her movements and intelligent as well.

366
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,832
Strangely, two mulattos
can never have children.

367
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:27,554
They're like mules in that respect.

368
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,391
Excuse me, Father, for contradicting
you, but that is nonsense.

369
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:39,037
- You cannot say such things.
- I did not say they are mules.

370
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,117
I said they are like mules.

371
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:44,949
Long's 'History of Jamaica'.
Read it before you challenge me.

372
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:49,199
I've a good mind to bring one back
with me to work here as a domestic.

373
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:54,110
Correct if I am in error, but if you were
to bring a slave back to England,

374
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:59,474
there would be some argument
whether or not they should be freed.

375
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,353
If I'm not mistaken...

376
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:07,594
I must say,
you've changed considerably.

377
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:13,193
I've done some reading on it... Thomas
Clarkson, under Edmund's guidance.

378
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:16,597
Fanny has a voracious mind,
as hungry as any man's.

379
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,395
And her writing is remarkable,
in a style entirely new.

380
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,433
Yes, good... Yes...

381
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:27,269
Your complexion is so improved.

382
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:31,029
I trust you will see as much
beauty of mind in time, Father.

383
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:35,995
You've gained so much countenance,
and your figure...

384
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,952
Please...

385
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,315
Don't you agree, Mr...Crawford?

386
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:45,229
- Purity is a decided attraction, true.
- lndeed.

387
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,919
Especially for the impure.

388
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:52,399
It must be the moral steadfastness
of her heart that illuminates her eyes.

389
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,916
- Please!
- Gentlemen...

390
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:59,636
Fanny is as fearful of notice and praise
as other women are of neglect.

391
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:03,469
- Most discerning, Miss Crawford.
- Thank you, Mr Bertram.

392
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:07,593
I have it! A ball at Mansfield Park
in honour of Fanny!

393
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,792
We shall introduce
Miss Fanny Price to society.

394
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:14,756
Some young man of good standing
will take notice.

395
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:19,397
She'll glide about with quiet elegance
and in admirable time.

396
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,750
You must excuse me.

397
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:25,194
I think I have something...

398
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:28,552
It needn't be a large affair,
just a few friends...

399
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,799
Fanny, don't be foolish, it is raining.

400
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,753
I see more distinctly through the rain.

401
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:43,033
- It's just a silly ball.
- I'll not be sold off like a slave!

402
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:45,037
Don't be an imbecile!

403
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:48,994
But imbecility in women is a great
enhancement to personal charms!

404
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,717
Fanny...

405
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,070
You're being irrational!

406
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,555
Another adornment.
I must be ravishing.

407
00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:01,276
Fanny, you really must begin
to harden yourself to the idea of...

408
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:04,233
...being worth looking at.

409
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:54,870
- You could do worse, Edmund.
- Sir?

410
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:58,311
She is witty and bright,
and not without...worth.

411
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:03,316
- How might you measure that worth?
- Don't impress me with your purity.

412
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:06,114
Her family is well-established,
it is well known.

413
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,834
The Prices?

414
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,193
The Crawfords, Edmund.

415
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:16,757
I meant the Crawfords...
Mary Crawford.

416
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,471
What are you reading?

417
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:07,559
Laurence Sterne's
'A Sentimental Journey'.

418
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,797
May l?

419
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:29,077
"l was interrupted with a voice
which I took to be that of a child,"

420
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,272
"which complained
it could not get out."

421
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:37,349
"l looked up and down the passage
and saw a starling in a little cage."

422
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:41,348
"'l can't get out, I can't get out!'
said the starling."

423
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:45,599
"'God help thee,' said l.
'But I'll let thee out, cost what it will."'

424
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:49,998
"But it was double-twisted with wire,
and I had to pull the cage to pieces."

425
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,589
"l took both hands to it."

426
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,394
"The bird flew to where I was
attempting his deliverance,"

427
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:59,957
"and thrusting his head
through the trellis as if impatient,"

428
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:03,877
"'l fear, poor creature,' said l,"

429
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:07,353
"'l cannot set thee at liberty."'

430
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:10,279
"'No,' said the starling."

431
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:14,678
"'l can't get out. I can't get out,'
said the starling."

432
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,995
You read well.

433
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,278
Thank you.

434
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:48,789
Father, I wish to speak
to you about Rushworth.

435
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,555
Maria, yes...

436
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:59,395
Now, you know how eagerly disposed
I was to like your Mr Rushworth.

437
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:03,115
But you think him
an inferior young man.

438
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:06,357
As ignorant in business as in books
with opinions unfixed

439
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:09,438
and without seeming
much aware of it himself.

440
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,071
I'm not blind, Father.

441
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:18,549
Perhaps the alliance, advantageous
as it is, was too quickly agreed to.

442
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:21,957
You need not worry, Maria,
I shall take care of you.

443
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:26,392
Every inconvenience should be braved
and the connection given up,

444
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:30,673
if you feel yourself unhappy
in the prospect of it.

445
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:35,469
I will not pretend
he is of shining character.

446
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:42,079
But I will also not pretend
that enjoying a larger income,

447
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:47,149
a house in the city and all the other
amiable pleasures it will afford,

448
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,794
are not an attraction.

449
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,831
As for the rest...

450
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:55,674
Well, he's still young.

451
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,279
And...

452
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,110
...I would like to marry him
immediately.

453
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:03,550
Within a fortnight.

454
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:07,469
- I do not understand the urgency.
- I don't understand the delay.

455
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:11,116
I would like for Julia to accompany me
on the honeymoon.

456
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:15,393
You wish for Julia to accompany you
on your honeymoon?

457
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:18,353
She's never been to Brighton.

458
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:30,951
- Evening.
- Evening to you, sir.

459
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,997
"Dear Susy,
Maria was married on Saturday."

460
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:41,351
"ln all important preparations of mind,
she was complete."

461
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:43,755
"Prepared for matrimony
by a hatred of home,

462
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:49,193
"disappointed affection and contempt
of the man she was to marry."

463
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:56,035
"The bride was elegantly dressed and
the bridesmaids were duly inferior. "

464
00:41:56,240 --> 00:42:02,349
"Her mother had her salts, expecting
to be agitated, and her aunt tried to cry. "

465
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:05,836
"Marriage is indeed
a manoeuvring business."

466
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:09,949
Goodbye, my precious!

467
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,196
Good luck!

468
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,913
Bye!

469
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:18,477
It is a comfort to think
you will never leave us, Fanny.

470
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:42,792
- My dear Fanny!
- Oh, no, no...

471
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:51,358
- I should take the apples to Mrs Norris.
- I want you to stay and play with me.

472
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:53,278
She must forgive me.

473
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:58,156
Selfishness must always be forgiven,
because there's no hope of a cure!

474
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:06,274
So lovely.

475
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:11,429
Tomorrow evening, the ballroom
shall be lit solely by your beauty.

476
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:14,677
You do have a fine form, my dear.

477
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,952
No wonder Edmund
so delights in your company.

478
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:21,277
I'm so evil he knows not
what to make of me.

479
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:24,517
Would that I had
your sound judgement.

480
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,271
Tell me...

481
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:30,995
- Does he speak of me?
- Occasionally.

482
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:34,351
Is that your harp in the front room?

483
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:38,348
Indeed. It was transported
from London on Henry's carriage.

484
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:40,437
I tried to hire a horse and cart,

485
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:44,713
but found I'd asked the most
unreasonable thing in the world!

486
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:49,436
I'd offended all the farmers,
the labourers and the hay in the parish.

487
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:51,790
Getting the hay in
is of great importance

488
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,958
in the country...at this time.

489
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:58,315
And music isn't?

490
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:01,159
It depends on the music, I suppose.

491
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:33,231
That's Edmund's favourite.
He seems very alive to music.

492
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,032
Yes...

493
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:39,358
Edmund says that in church it is music
that best allows the spirit...

494
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:41,710
...to aspire to the beyond.

495
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,273
Heavens!

496
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:47,951
Why waste it on drowsy church-goers
starched up into seeming piety?

497
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:51,596
Give me a concert or a dance.
I'm sure he'd agree.

498
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:55,349
Forgive me my contradiction,
but I'm sure he wouldn't.

499
00:44:55,560 --> 00:45:01,271
When he takes orders in a few weeks,
he will begin his own services.

500
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:03,789
Takes orders?

501
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:07,119
Is Edmund to be a clergyman?

502
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:09,072
Yes.

503
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:13,998
But a clergyman is so drear.
A clergyman's wife is even worse!

504
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:19,550
What profession would you suggest,
Miss Crawford?

505
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:22,149
I'm not, as you know, the first born.

506
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:25,716
There must be an uncle or grandfather
to place you somewhere?

507
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,558
There is not.

508
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,716
Choose law, then, it's not too late.

509
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:33,230
At least you can distinguish yourself
there with language and wit.

510
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:37,752
I have no wish to blunder about
on the borders of empty repartee.

511
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:39,996
Your father could put you
into Parliament.

512
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:44,273
My father's choices
are less than compelling for me.

513
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:47,597
No, I wish to become a clergyman.

514
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:52,791
There are worse things than a life
of compassion and contemplation.

515
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:00,593
She doesn't think evil,
but she speaks it.

516
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,916
It grieves me to the soul.

517
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:06,078
The effect of education perhaps.

518
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:10,436
Perhaps I can uneducate her.

519
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:13,916
Fanny, would that more women
were like you.

520
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:19,478
I love you more than words can say.
I demand the first dance at the ball.

521
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:48,190
One's consequence varies so much
at times without any particular reason.

522
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:54,270
There's a reason for everything.
Your entire person is agreeable.

523
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:58,630
Yes. Well, tonight
I agree with everyone.

524
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:05,112
Edmund...

525
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:11,236
I think you should admit
you're in love with Fanny Price.

526
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:13,556
Of course I love her, but...

527
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:18,709
...there are as many forms of love
as there are moments in time.

528
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:30,594
Perfect! You dance like an angel,
Fanny Price.

529
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:34,190
One does not dance
like an angel alone, Mr Crawford.

530
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:38,279
A compliment?!
Let the heavens rejoice!

531
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:42,553
I complimented your dancing.
Keep your wig on!

532
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:54,154
- Thank you.
- See you soon.

533
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:57,071
- Bye!
- Bye-bye.

534
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:08,830
"A few hours
before Laura died, she said,"

535
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:12,237
"'Take warning from my unhappy end."'

536
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:16,399
"'Beware of fainting fits.
Beware of swoons."'

537
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:40,473
"'Run mad as often as you choose..."'

538
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:45,632
"'...but do not faint."'

539
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:52,758
- Good afternoon.
- Hello, Sir Thomas.

540
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:55,394
- Good afternoon, sir.
- My dear.

541
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:59,353
I've been thinking about the parsonage.

542
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:01,516
Not you, too?

543
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:04,230
Spades are trumps, Fanny.

544
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:09,798
- I'm all in the glow of a new scheme.
- And what might that be?

545
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,833
Might you rent the parsonage to me?

546
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:17,431
- But it is to be Edmund's.
- Anyone to purchase a queen?

547
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:19,995
- At what cost?
- Two shillings.

548
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:24,591
- Highway robbery!
- Mr Bertram could stay living here.

549
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:26,916
You can stay close to your family,

550
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:31,238
and I can continue to improve
and perfect my friendship and...

551
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:35,115
...intimacy
with the Mansfield Park family.

552
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:38,232
I have a better plan. Live here with us.

553
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:41,432
Stay as long as you wish.
Bring all your horses.

554
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:44,632
Your sister, too.
Be as one of our family.

555
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:50,198
- We'd thrive on it, wouldn't we, Fanny?
- Of course. A king for three shillings?

556
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:54,152
- I will.
- Mary! It's exorbitant!

557
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:58,876
I'll stake my last like a woman of spirit.
No cold prudence for me.

558
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:01,435
I was not made
to sit still and do nothing!

559
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:05,474
If I lose the game,
it shall not be for not striving for it.

560
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:12,759
Well done, Fanny!

561
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:19,595
Fanny! I must speak to you...

562
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:21,756
Yes, Mr Crawford?

563
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:28,271
You must know
why I intend to rent the parsonage.

564
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:32,951
I wish to continue improving
and perfecting my intimacy...

565
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:34,991
...with you!

566
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:40,149
You have created sensations which
my heart has never known before.

567
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:43,318
The one happiness in life
is to love and be loved.

568
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:45,715
Mr Crawford, do not speak nonsense!

569
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:48,556
Nonsense?

570
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:52,355
I'm afraid you may end
in convincing yourself!

571
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:57,190
Fanny... You are killing me!

572
00:51:57,400 --> 00:52:01,234
No man dies of love but on the stage.

573
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:18,032
"The intimacy between them
daily increased,"

574
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:22,711
"till it grew to such a pitch that
they did not scruple to kick one another"

575
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:25,798
"on the slightest provocation."

576
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:29,998
Yes?

577
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:36,518
My sweet girl! This is a great day,
a great day indeed.

578
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,517
Yes... Is it?

579
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:41,917
You may make me more proud
than my own daughters.

580
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:44,998
Please don't say that, sir.

581
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:48,998
Why is there no fire here today?

582
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:54,074
- I'm not cold, sir.
- But you have a fire in general?

583
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:57,238
No, sir, but I have a warm shawl.

584
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:01,956
Your aunt cannot be aware of this.

585
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:07,275
I understand.

586
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:12,235
For as long as you're in my home,
Fanny Price, you shall have a fire.

587
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:17,432
I am aware that there has been
a misplaced distinction, but...

588
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:22,270
...I think too well of you to suppose
you will ever harbour resentment.

589
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:24,914
Thus, it is with more pleasure,

590
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:29,796
that I inform you that Henry Crawford
has asked my permission to marry you,

591
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,070
and I have given my blessing.

592
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:35,955
I'd no idea his feelings
had come to such a boiling point!

593
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:41,109
Clearly, I am too old to follow
the intricate manoeuvrings of the young.

594
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:47,313
Please get ready
and join me downstairs.

595
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:52,640
Mr Crawford, as you have
perhaps foreseen, is still in the house.

596
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:01,108
Do not fear.

597
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:03,515
I cannot, sir.

598
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:05,358
Cannot what?

599
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:09,155
I cannot agree to marry him...
at this time.

600
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:13,512
You do not know your own feelings.
I've watched you with him.

601
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:17,110
You're not insensitive to his charms.
I'm not that old!

602
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:19,356
He's not without charm, sir.

603
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:23,314
Has someone else
declared his intention for you?

604
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:26,830
- No, sir.
- Then what is it?

605
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,673
I do not trust his nature.

606
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:34,998
Like many charming people, he
depends on the appreciation of others.

607
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:37,191
What is the ill in that?

608
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:41,029
His sole interest is in being loved,
not in loving.

609
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:46,917
- You've read too many novels, girl!
- But it has not clouded my judgement.

610
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:51,469
- Do you trust me?
- My future entirely depends on you.

611
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:54,513
Let me repeat: do you trust me?

612
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:57,439
- Yes, sir.
- Well, I trust him.

613
00:54:57,640 --> 00:55:00,598
You will marry him!

614
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:03,360
I will not...

615
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:07,232
...sir.

616
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:16,034
I had, Fanny Price, thought you
free from wilfulness of temper,

617
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:20,552
self-conceit and every tendency
to that independence of spirit,

618
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:24,548
which prevails so much today
even in young women.

619
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:30,312
In young women it is especially
offensive beyond all common offence.

620
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:35,150
You seem to forget you do not have
an annual income like Mary Crawford.

621
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:37,271
Nor does your family.

622
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:41,996
Their advantage or disadvantage
has never been in your thoughts.

623
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:45,954
The young man addresses you
with everything to recommend him.

624
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:50,233
Not merely situation in life, fortune
and character, but also agreeableness,

625
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:53,113
with pleasing address
and conversation.

626
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:56,596
...not an acquaintance,
you've known him some time.

627
00:55:56,800 --> 00:56:02,955
His sister is your intimate friend.
He cannot have taken you by surprise.

628
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:07,472
You have observed his attentions
and received them properly...

629
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:13,277
You do not know your own feelings.
Let us put an end to this conference.

630
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:15,948
...and because you do not feel
for him

631
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:21,029
what a young heated fancy imagines
to be necessary for happiness...

632
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:23,231
I should say not...

633
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:30,150
You are in a wild fit of folly, throwing
away an opportunity to be settled in life,

634
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:36,276
eligibly, honourably, nobly settled,
as will probably never occur again.

635
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:42,272
And I will tell you what, Fanny Price,
which is more than I did for Maria...

636
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:45,597
The next time that Pug has a litter...

637
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:49,393
...you shall have a puppy.

638
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:58,952
All she needs is time, Sir Thomas.

639
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:01,037
He loves you, Fanny Price.

640
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:06,758
If any man ever loved a woman forever,
Henry would do as much for you.

641
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:09,396
Edmund...

642
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:13,073
What are your thoughts?

643
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:18,911
The fact that he chose you, Fanny,
is evidence of his good character.

644
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:26,152
He could make you very happy,
and you would be the making of him.

645
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:35,196
It is not certain that a man must be
acceptable to every woman he likes.

646
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:40,793
Perhaps you'd rather return home?
I can write to your mother tonight.

647
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:45,039
A little abstinence from the luxuries
of Mansfield Park

648
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:48,471
might bring your mind
into a more sober state.

649
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:51,638
Is that your choice, young woman?

650
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:55,036
Yes.

651
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:57,478
It is.

652
00:57:58,040 --> 00:57:59,439
Why, Fanny?

653
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,753
To be at home again...

654
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:10,160
...to be loved by my family,

655
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:14,148
to feel affection
without fear or restraint and...

656
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:19,558
...to feel myself the equal
of those that surround me.

657
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:40,956
I hope you know...

658
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:47,068
I hope you know how much I shall...

659
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:50,272
...shall write to you.

660
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:54,875
And I shall write to you...

661
00:58:57,600 --> 00:59:00,990
...when I have anything
worth writing about.

662
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:22,515
Who says we shall not be sisters?

663
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:24,711
I know we shall.

664
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:29,077
Whoa, there! Whoa!

665
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:54,718
Mother!

666
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:56,797
Fanny!

667
01:00:58,040 --> 01:00:59,837
Come in.

668
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:03,199
You must be exhausted
from your journey.

669
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:06,073
It's surprisingly short really.

670
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:09,033
Look at you. So...

671
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:15,436
Betsey, get Father up!
Come in.

672
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:17,756
It's Susy's turn.

673
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:25,796
Did you have a tiring journey?
You must be exhausted. Betsey!

674
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,798
- I got him up yesterday.
- Liar!

675
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:40,118
- You must have many servants.
- I have to do quite a lot, actually.

676
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:44,199
- I help Lady Bertram and Aunt Norris.
- I only have the two girls.

677
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:47,915
We had some help,
but now Father has no work.

678
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:49,758
Hello.

679
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:54,397
- How long are you here for, Fanny?
- I cannot say exactly.

680
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:57,194
Father won't get up.

681
01:01:57,760 --> 01:02:00,069
She's here!

682
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:03,354
Oh, hello!

683
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:07,437
Oh, my God! Oh, Fanny!

684
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:10,074
You look so fancy.

685
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:15,400
Like a princess! Didn't I tell you
she'd be beautiful, Mother?

686
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:17,677
Yes, you did.

687
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:22,196
Father, Fanny's come home.
Here she is.

688
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:26,230
Turn round, then.
Let's have a look at you.

689
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:28,917
Turn around!

690
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:33,754
Lovely.

691
01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:39,075
Come here, Chatterbox,
I was just teasing you.

692
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:43,319
Give your coarse old father
a big squeeze.

693
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:48,711
Welcome home, Fanny.

694
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:52,393
It'll be good to have another girl around.

695
01:02:53,080 --> 01:02:59,110
Well, I'm about ready to throw down
some straw and call this place a stall.

696
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:01,390
Don't get me started!

697
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:26,990
"Beware of fainting fits,
beware of swoons."

698
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:31,113
"A frenzy fit is not so pernicious.
It is an exercise to the body."

699
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:34,198
"lf not too violent,
it is conducive to health."

700
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:36,675
Fanny, a letter!

701
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:38,393
Who is it from?

702
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:41,478
Mary Crawford, a friend.

703
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:46,829
"How we miss you,
my dearest Fanny Price."

704
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:51,158
"My brother is moping. Please write
a pretty reply to gladden his eyes."

705
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:56,514
"Tell me of all the dashing captains
whom you disdain for his sake."

706
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:04,077
"I have seen Julia and Mrs Rushworth
at Wimpole Street the other day. "

707
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:09,434
"We seemed very glad to see each
other, and I do think we were a little. "

708
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:13,595
"We had a vast deal to say... "

709
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:17,677
"...especially on the subject
of you and Henry. "

710
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:21,998
"I'll tell you how Mrs Rushworth looked
when your name was mentioned. "

711
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:24,236
Fanny...?

712
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:26,351
Fanny Price?

713
01:04:26,560 --> 01:04:29,199
"I didn't think her wanting
in self-possession, "

714
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:34,428
"but she had not quite enough
for the demands of yesterday. "

715
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:38,189
I shall believe it when I believe it, Henry.

716
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:41,153
And so you shall, Mrs Rushworth.

717
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:45,356
"And as for Edmund,
clergyman or not, "

718
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:50,475
"let me say, I am increasingly
sensitive to his charms. "

719
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:53,638
"Yours affectionately,
Mary Crawford."

720
01:04:53,840 --> 01:04:55,831
Betsey!

721
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:05,628
This Henry Crawford, what's he like?

722
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:07,990
A rake, I think.

723
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:11,192
Yes, please!

724
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:14,278
They amuse more in literature
than in life.

725
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:16,835
But they amuse!

726
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:18,553
And Lady Bertram?

727
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:21,513
- She's always suffering fatigue.
- Why?

728
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:25,110
Generally from embroidering
something of little beauty.

729
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:28,437
Not to mention
a handsome dose of opium daily.

730
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:32,599
Your tongue is sharper
than a guillotine, Fanny.

731
01:05:33,560 --> 01:05:36,518
The effect of education, I suppose.

732
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:47,717
Miss Price! Miss Fanny Price!

733
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:51,151
- Miss Price?
- What is that racket?

734
01:05:51,360 --> 01:05:55,194
- Miss Price!
- What is it, boy?

735
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:58,198
I must see Fanny Price!

736
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:04,234
Miss Price?

737
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:09,197
- Miss Fanny Price...
- I'm Fanny Price.

738
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:13,632
- You sure? I don't get paid if you're not.
- Yes, I'm sure I'm Fanny Price.

739
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:16,798
All right, then, stay back.

740
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:07,510
I was supposed to say something
about starlings flying...I can't remember.

741
01:07:07,720 --> 01:07:10,792
Yes, we've got the general idea.
Thank you.

742
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,560
Fanny, what is this?

743
01:07:28,360 --> 01:07:29,873
Thank you for coming.

744
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:32,469
- Mr Price.
- Yes?

745
01:07:33,320 --> 01:07:37,359
- Henry Crawford. Friend of...
-...Maria Bertram's.

746
01:07:37,560 --> 01:07:39,676
Pleased to meet you.

747
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:43,074
And you must be Mrs Price.

748
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:47,751
I see the resemblance to your sisters,
Lady Bertram and Mrs Norris.

749
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:51,032
Your family has
no inconsiderable share of beauty.

750
01:07:51,240 --> 01:07:54,152
You're too kind, Mr Crawford.

751
01:07:54,360 --> 01:07:55,998
Miss Price.

752
01:07:56,800 --> 01:07:58,552
Mr Crawford.

753
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:03,233
It was you, wasn't it?
The birds and everything...

754
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:08,389
I'm sorry, l...do not know
to what you're referring.

755
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:18,196
So, what is the news of Mansfield?
How is everyone?

756
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:22,075
Everyone being Edmund...
Fanny, I know.

757
01:08:22,280 --> 01:08:26,068
- You know what, Henry?
- I know you love Edmund.

758
01:08:26,280 --> 01:08:28,635
I wish to speak in truths.

759
01:08:28,840 --> 01:08:33,152
It is the effect of your education of me,
Fanny Price.

760
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:40,953
He is a fine man, I understand,
but he is to be married to my sister.

761
01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:44,311
The words have been spoken?

762
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:46,476
All but.

763
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:52,869
- I shall wait to grieve until then.
- You must grieve now.

764
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:58,316
I know I have an appearance
of inauthenticity.

765
01:08:58,520 --> 01:09:04,595
You're infinitely my superior in merit,
you have touches of the angel in you.

766
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:10,272
And I know you have witnessed
my insincere attentions toward Maria.

767
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:15,508
But your eyes are so clear and
unflinching, please look at me again.

768
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:17,631
I am changed, Fanny Price.

769
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:20,957
I shall wait for you till the end of time.

770
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:23,549
My constancy shall prove
that I am changed.

771
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:26,832
It is your very changefulness
that frightens me.

772
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:29,429
- You toy with me.
- No.

773
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:33,952
Senseless as it is,
my heart is still full of another.

774
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:41,555
Then I shall wait...

775
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:45,313
...till it is free once more.

776
01:09:55,160 --> 01:09:57,799
"It is the habits ofwealth that I fear. "

777
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:02,471
"Still, she is the only woman
whom I could ever think of as... "

778
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:07,151
Go and sit down, Charlie,
I've got to read this letter.

779
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:09,078
Susy, could you...?

780
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:20,748
"Still, she is the only woman
whom I could ever think of as... "

781
01:10:22,160 --> 01:10:24,116
"...a wife. "

782
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:16,869
Where would your tenants go,
if we moved in?

783
01:11:17,080 --> 01:11:20,675
I've several apartments,
they'd be well-cared for.

784
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:25,192
- It is a generous offer.
- The first of many, I hope.

785
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:46,352
Fanny...

786
01:11:48,680 --> 01:11:49,954
Yes?

787
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:54,077
I've been thinking, Fanny.

788
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:06,118
There is no shame in wealth, my dear.

789
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:14,956
- That depends on how it's arrived at.
- Frances! Come here!

790
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:21,235
Just remember, Fanny...

791
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:25,797
...I married for love.

792
01:12:42,720 --> 01:12:44,597
How does it feel to be home?

793
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:48,156
Portsmouth is Portsmouth,
and Mansfield is home.

794
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:51,193
You don't like to be near the water?

795
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:53,356
Not without the means
to float away on it.

796
01:12:53,560 --> 01:12:54,834
You have.

797
01:12:55,040 --> 01:13:00,478
Poverty frightens me. A woman's
poverty is harsher than a man's.

798
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:02,636
Well, arguable.

799
01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:06,194
- It need not be your lot.
- I know.

800
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:10,154
You can spend your days in comfort...
with me.

801
01:13:11,680 --> 01:13:14,240
- I know.
- You do?

802
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:16,956
Yes.

803
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:26,630
Is that a 'yes'?

804
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:31,157
Yes.

805
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:47,197
Is that the 'yes' I've heard a thousand
times in my heart but not from you?

806
01:13:55,880 --> 01:13:58,155
Oh, Fanny Price!

807
01:14:01,120 --> 01:14:06,274
You will learn to love me.
Say it again, please, say it!

808
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:09,556
Yes!

809
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:58,954
Good morning, Miss Price!
Good morning, my darling!

810
01:14:59,160 --> 01:15:03,119
- Stop, please! Stop it!
- Good morning.

811
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:12,031
Charlie, come on.

812
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:16,360
I spoke hastily.

813
01:15:19,160 --> 01:15:23,199
I've anguished over the matter,
and I feel that I cannot...

814
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:27,789
I cannot marry you.

815
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:31,358
I'm not prepared.

816
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:37,432
- And when might you be prepared?
- I cannot say.

817
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:41,273
When might that be?

818
01:15:42,160 --> 01:15:44,958
I still doubt you and cannot trust you.

819
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:47,116
Doubt me?

820
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:53,475
Your behaviour is that of someone
trustworthy, the standard of trust?

821
01:15:53,680 --> 01:15:55,238
Forgive me.

822
01:15:56,920 --> 01:15:59,673
Enjoy your stay in Portsmouth,
Miss Price.

823
01:16:01,720 --> 01:16:05,713
May it be long...
and up to your standards.

824
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:10,154
Henry...

825
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:32,993
Are you certain?

826
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:36,158
I have no talent for certainty, Susy.

827
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,309
Fanny, come quickly.

828
01:16:58,520 --> 01:16:59,999
Fanny...

829
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:03,510
Who's to pay for all this paper, Fanny?

830
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:05,039
Come, come.

831
01:17:14,720 --> 01:17:16,199
Edmund...

832
01:17:16,920 --> 01:17:20,799
I've come to take you back
to Mansfield. You're needed there.

833
01:17:22,440 --> 01:17:26,956
- What's happened?
- Tom was celebrating and fell ill.

834
01:17:27,160 --> 01:17:31,472
The group he was travelling with
left him to recover with Yates...

835
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:34,274
...who then deserted him as well.

836
01:17:34,480 --> 01:17:37,358
He was found almost dead
two days ago.

837
01:17:38,040 --> 01:17:39,996
The situation is very grave.

838
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:43,919
We must hurry.

839
01:17:44,120 --> 01:17:46,190
If you wish to, that is.

840
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:55,952
Fanny, I cannot tell you how much l...

841
01:17:56,640 --> 01:18:00,474
- I shall see you soon, Susy, I feel it.
- Go on, now!

842
01:18:01,720 --> 01:18:06,350
Remember: "Run mad as often
as you choose, but do not faint!"

843
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:24,758
I trust, other than this tragedy,
you're well?

844
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:27,716
Yes...

845
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:30,878
As I intimated in my last letter,

846
01:18:31,080 --> 01:18:36,837
I believe Mary has almost reconciled
herself to marrying a stodgy clergyman.

847
01:18:43,160 --> 01:18:46,118
I understand Crawford paid you a visit.

848
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:47,719
Yes.

849
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:51,394
And was he attentive?

850
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:54,797
Yes... Very.

851
01:18:58,320 --> 01:19:01,198
And has your heart changed
towards him?

852
01:19:03,560 --> 01:19:05,198
Yes...

853
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:07,436
Several times.

854
01:19:09,880 --> 01:19:13,111
I have... I find that l...

855
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:16,318
I find that...

856
01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:24,509
Surely you and I are beyond speaking,
when words are clearly not enough.

857
01:19:30,120 --> 01:19:31,917
I missed you.

858
01:19:34,120 --> 01:19:36,315
And I you.

859
01:20:50,920 --> 01:20:54,913
- Fanny, you're back.
- Yes, sir.

860
01:20:55,120 --> 01:21:00,035
Good. We've had our fill
of estrangement at Mansfield Park.

861
01:21:14,040 --> 01:21:15,314
Water.

862
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:28,393
The light...please.

863
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:35,908
- Morning, sir.
- Dear Mr Crawford.

864
01:21:36,120 --> 01:21:42,150
Thank you for joining us at this difficult
time. Maria will be joining us later.

865
01:21:42,360 --> 01:21:45,796
Mr Rushworth is detained
with improvements to Sotherton.

866
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:50,312
- Miss Julia is due within the hour.
- Welcome.

867
01:21:50,520 --> 01:21:53,273
- Fanny.
- Thank you for coming.

868
01:21:53,480 --> 01:21:59,350
Fanny, I've been meaning to ask you,
how long are you staying?

869
01:22:00,160 --> 01:22:04,472
I'm not certain, Aunt Norris.
And how long are you staying?

870
01:22:59,080 --> 01:23:01,036
Mrs Rushworth...

871
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:05,716
- I trust you are well?
- I'm fine.

872
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:08,150
And Mr Rushworth?

873
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:10,917
Maria...

874
01:23:13,440 --> 01:23:18,150
Is this the behaviour of friends?
Maria... Please...

875
01:23:18,360 --> 01:23:20,351
How's Fanny?

876
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:26,149
She's a good little girl.

877
01:23:28,160 --> 01:23:31,835
And you've become a good little boy?

878
01:23:39,240 --> 01:23:42,198
She's rejected me, Maria.

879
01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:54,556
Would that this sigh were for me...

880
01:24:59,240 --> 01:25:01,549
My son is mad.

881
01:25:03,440 --> 01:25:05,829
Go to your room!

882
01:25:06,040 --> 01:25:08,076
Get out!

883
01:26:50,200 --> 01:26:53,829
Fanny, what is it? What?
What's wrong?

884
01:26:54,040 --> 01:26:55,314
What?

885
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:14,918
Don't look at me like that.
Rushworth's a fool, and I can't get out.

886
01:27:16,200 --> 01:27:18,031
Edmund...

887
01:27:18,680 --> 01:27:20,875
I can't get out.

888
01:28:03,080 --> 01:28:05,036
You all right?

889
01:28:11,640 --> 01:28:14,154
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

890
01:28:29,320 --> 01:28:31,914
Good morning, Mansfield Park!

891
01:28:32,120 --> 01:28:33,838
Come!

892
01:28:44,280 --> 01:28:48,558
Get Edmund, Sir Thomas and Maria.
We have an important guest here.

893
01:28:48,760 --> 01:28:52,514
Edmund! This is Mr Dixon
of the 'London Times'.

894
01:28:52,720 --> 01:28:58,317
He is writing an article about modern
gardens and is interested in Sotherton.

895
01:28:58,520 --> 01:29:00,078
Where's Maria?

896
01:29:00,280 --> 01:29:04,990
He has noticed the influence of Gilpin.
He loves the new ruins.

897
01:29:05,200 --> 01:29:08,590
Wake up, you degenerate lot!
Hello!

898
01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:11,314
- Maria?
- Sir... Sir!

899
01:29:24,320 --> 01:29:28,632
- Where's Maria?
- I could not say...

900
01:29:29,440 --> 01:29:31,237
At this hour?

901
01:29:33,040 --> 01:29:35,076
We'll speak to Crawford.

902
01:29:35,280 --> 01:29:39,876
It was recommendation to remove
the avenue of oaks from the west front,

903
01:29:40,080 --> 01:29:43,516
up to the top of the hill.

904
01:29:46,320 --> 01:29:51,155
- Where is Crawford?
- At the parsonage with the Grants.

905
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:57,196
No, we...stopped there first.

906
01:30:13,720 --> 01:30:15,551
Sir Thomas...

907
01:30:15,760 --> 01:30:19,469
There's something you must read.
Oh, dear, dear...

908
01:30:19,680 --> 01:30:24,674
It is...quite startling.
Here, in the society section.

909
01:30:31,280 --> 01:30:33,874
Fanny...

910
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:36,949
You read it to us.

911
01:30:37,160 --> 01:30:40,914
You have such a strong, clear voice.

912
01:30:52,760 --> 01:30:56,469
"lt is with infinite concern
we have to announce that..."

913
01:30:56,680 --> 01:31:02,471
"...a matrimonial fracas in the family
of Mr Rushworth of Wimpole Street."

914
01:31:04,080 --> 01:31:05,354
Go on.

915
01:31:06,280 --> 01:31:07,793
"The beautiful Mrs Rushworth,"

916
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:11,390
"who was to be so brilliant a leader
in the fashionable world,"

917
01:31:11,600 --> 01:31:17,152
"has quitted her husband's roof
for the captivating Mr Crawford,"

918
01:31:17,360 --> 01:31:20,477
"the intimate friend
of not only Mr Rushworth,"

919
01:31:20,680 --> 01:31:25,754
"but Mrs Rushworth's father,
Sir Thomas Bertram of Mansfield Park."

920
01:31:25,960 --> 01:31:30,909
"lt is not known even to the editor
whither they have gone."

921
01:31:31,120 --> 01:31:33,554
May God help us.

922
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:40,197
The fools! Under this roof!

923
01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:44,632
They should've known Rushworth
would bring in a newspaper man.

924
01:31:44,840 --> 01:31:49,197
Under which roof
would it have been better, Mary?

925
01:31:49,400 --> 01:31:53,154
I understand your bitterness,
but do not direct it at me.

926
01:31:53,360 --> 01:31:55,669
Your brother is an actor.

927
01:31:55,880 --> 01:31:59,350
A charming inscrutable actor,
through and through.

928
01:31:59,560 --> 01:32:04,873
The temptation of quick pleasure was
too strong for one unused to sacrifices.

929
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:11,311
After all the cost and care of an
anxious and expensive education,

930
01:32:11,520 --> 01:32:14,637
I do not feel I know
my own children at all.

931
01:32:14,840 --> 01:32:17,957
Now, please, of course
you know them.

932
01:32:18,160 --> 01:32:21,391
This is 1 806, for heaven's sake!

933
01:32:21,600 --> 01:32:25,878
This is not the first time, nor the last,
such a thing will happen.

934
01:32:26,080 --> 01:32:27,638
Look...

935
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:30,673
You are indeed a family in distress,

936
01:32:30,880 --> 01:32:34,316
but you must recover
and survive gracefully.

937
01:32:36,120 --> 01:32:39,476
If Henry does not choose
to marry Maria,

938
01:32:39,680 --> 01:32:42,911
and if you also reject her,
she will be an outcast.

939
01:32:43,120 --> 01:32:46,078
A leaf in the wind of other men's plans.

940
01:32:46,280 --> 01:32:47,759
Or...

941
01:32:49,080 --> 01:32:51,196
We can recover.

942
01:32:52,760 --> 01:32:54,876
Here is my proposal...

943
01:32:55,080 --> 01:32:58,117
We must persuade Henry
to marry Maria.

944
01:32:58,320 --> 01:33:01,630
After a respectable period,
Edmund and I will accept them

945
01:33:01,840 --> 01:33:05,674
into our acquaintance...
and household.

946
01:33:10,320 --> 01:33:15,633
Then you all, after an appropriate
period, will properly support them, too.

947
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:19,355
The Bertrams, being people
of respectability, as they are,

948
01:33:19,560 --> 01:33:23,838
she may recover her footing in society
to a certain degree.

949
01:33:24,040 --> 01:33:28,113
In some circles, she'd never be
admitted, but with dinners and parties...

950
01:33:28,320 --> 01:33:30,834
...some people will like her acquaintance.

951
01:33:31,040 --> 01:33:32,553
Such a strategy.

952
01:33:32,760 --> 01:33:37,709
And how will a poor clergyman
afford these dinners and parties?

953
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:40,388
Chance is not always unkind.

954
01:33:42,800 --> 01:33:45,678
I beg your pardon.

955
01:33:47,440 --> 01:33:50,193
If Tom is not able to recover,

956
01:33:50,400 --> 01:33:52,834
Edmund will be the heir.

957
01:33:53,040 --> 01:33:56,953
Wealth and consequence could fall
into hands no more deserving.

958
01:34:07,200 --> 01:34:10,715
I understand you think
I should not say such things.

959
01:34:10,920 --> 01:34:14,196
But one must prepare oneself
for every eventuality.

960
01:34:14,400 --> 01:34:16,755
It is the mark of an evolved individual.

961
01:34:16,960 --> 01:34:22,478
I advise that you, Sir Thomas, do not
injure your cause by interference.

962
01:34:22,680 --> 01:34:24,671
Let things take their course.

963
01:34:24,880 --> 01:34:27,030
That may be a difficult thing,

964
01:34:27,240 --> 01:34:31,995
but although Tom, bless his heart, may
not be strong enough for this world,

965
01:34:32,200 --> 01:34:34,839
the rest of us must be.

966
01:34:37,680 --> 01:34:41,275
I speak merely of what must be done,
not what I feel.

967
01:34:41,480 --> 01:34:45,792
You may wish to reconsider
your eagerness for Tom's death.

968
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:50,073
You may wish to reconsider
your thinly-veiled anger towards me!

969
01:34:52,120 --> 01:34:56,318
If you'd accepted my brother,
you'd be now on the point of marriage,

970
01:34:56,520 --> 01:34:59,956
and Henry would not be
on terms with Mrs Rushworth.

971
01:35:00,160 --> 01:35:02,958
It would have ended
in a regular flirtation

972
01:35:03,160 --> 01:35:05,913
in meetings at Sotherton
and Everingham.

973
01:35:06,120 --> 01:35:09,829
It could all be construed as your fault.

974
01:35:12,720 --> 01:35:16,156
Your startling adaptability
to my brother's possible demise

975
01:35:16,360 --> 01:35:20,194
sends a chill through my heart.

976
01:35:20,760 --> 01:35:22,955
A chill...

977
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:28,671
You're cheerfully planning parties
with his money!

978
01:35:28,880 --> 01:35:32,395
You shush my father
like a dog at your table.

979
01:35:32,600 --> 01:35:38,391
You attack Fanny for following her own
infallible guide on matters of the heart.

980
01:35:38,600 --> 01:35:43,355
All this has grievously convinced me
that the person I've so dwelt on

981
01:35:43,560 --> 01:35:45,949
has been a creature
of my own imagination!

982
01:35:48,320 --> 01:35:50,311
Not you, Miss Crawford...

983
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:54,558
You are a stranger to me.

984
01:35:56,680 --> 01:36:01,276
I do not know you, and I'm sorry to say,
I have no wish to.

985
01:36:33,120 --> 01:36:35,475
Is there anything to be done?

986
01:36:35,680 --> 01:36:37,318
Wait...

987
01:36:39,120 --> 01:36:41,839
- Wait?
- Yes.

988
01:36:42,040 --> 01:36:45,157
Time can do almost anything.

989
01:36:54,440 --> 01:36:56,635
He'll be all right.

990
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:07,515
He survived brain fever
when he was six.

991
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:17,037
He used to play 'Tom the Knight'.

992
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:22,270
"Give me a mission, Father," he'd say.

993
01:37:23,800 --> 01:37:27,475
I'd send him with a message to mother
about the tea or...

994
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:31,790
...to get Baddeley
to get the carriage ready.

995
01:37:32,640 --> 01:37:34,596
"No, Father..."

996
01:37:36,520 --> 01:37:38,795
"Give me a noble mission."

997
01:37:45,640 --> 01:37:48,393
That's all he ever wanted.

998
01:38:02,760 --> 01:38:05,069
I'm sorry, Tom.

999
01:38:09,200 --> 01:38:10,553
I'm so sorry.

1000
01:38:39,040 --> 01:38:41,679
"In good and perfect time, "

1001
01:38:41,880 --> 01:38:44,633
"Tom's health did return. "

1002
01:38:44,840 --> 01:38:48,594
"Henry Crawford chose
not to marry Maria. "

1003
01:38:49,880 --> 01:38:53,475
"Mrs Norris, who Sir Thomas
came to regard as an evil, "

1004
01:38:53,680 --> 01:38:58,037
"went to devote herself
to her...unfortunate niece. "

1005
01:38:59,560 --> 01:39:04,998
"It may be supposed that their tempers
became their mutual punishment. "

1006
01:39:06,280 --> 01:39:10,239
"It could have turned out differently,
I suppose. "

1007
01:39:13,800 --> 01:39:16,519
"But it didn't. "

1008
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:44,470
"Mary Crawford went to live
in Westminster. "

1009
01:39:44,680 --> 01:39:49,037
"Eventually, she and Henry found
partners who shared their more... "

1010
01:39:49,240 --> 01:39:52,198
"...modern sensibilities. "

1011
01:40:02,720 --> 01:40:05,109
"And...as you may have guessed, "

1012
01:40:05,320 --> 01:40:10,440
"exactly when it was natural that
it should be so, not a moment sooner, "

1013
01:40:10,640 --> 01:40:15,395
"Edmund came to speak the whole
delightful...and astonishing truth. "

1014
01:40:15,600 --> 01:40:18,637
Fanny, I must confess something.

1015
01:40:26,440 --> 01:40:29,318
I've loved you all my life.

1016
01:40:29,520 --> 01:40:32,034
I know, Edmund.

1017
01:40:37,600 --> 01:40:39,158
No, Fanny...

1018
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,958
As a man loves a woman.

1019
01:40:48,440 --> 01:40:51,398
As a hero loves a heroine.

1020
01:40:55,520 --> 01:40:59,593
As I've never loved anyone
in my entire life.

1021
01:41:03,320 --> 01:41:06,835
I was so anxious to do what is right...

1022
01:41:07,760 --> 01:41:10,115
...that I forgot to do what is right.

1023
01:41:11,720 --> 01:41:14,359
But if you choose me,

1024
01:41:15,200 --> 01:41:18,954
after all my blundering and blindness,

1025
01:41:21,760 --> 01:41:26,436
that will be a happiness
which no description could reach.

1026
01:41:28,040 --> 01:41:29,439
Oh, Edmund.

1027
01:42:06,680 --> 01:42:11,117
Looks as though
they're finally getting somewhere.

1028
01:42:12,840 --> 01:42:14,432
Hello!

1029
01:42:16,080 --> 01:42:17,354
Julia...

1030
01:42:20,160 --> 01:42:22,879
Mr...Yates?

1031
01:42:23,080 --> 01:42:28,871
Now, Joan of Arc lived
during the reign of Henry...Vl?

1032
01:42:29,080 --> 01:42:32,117
- Is that correct?
- Yes, Susy.

1033
01:42:32,320 --> 01:42:35,915
I knew that, yes, I did.
I knew that.

1034
01:42:36,120 --> 01:42:39,032
"Susan came to live
at Mansfield Park. "

1035
01:42:39,240 --> 01:42:41,231
"Tom grew stronger by the day. "

1036
01:42:41,440 --> 01:42:44,989
"Sir Thomas eventually
abandoned his pursuits in Antigua. "

1037
01:42:45,200 --> 01:42:50,228
"He chose to pursue some
exciting new opportunities in... "

1038
01:42:50,440 --> 01:42:52,476
"...tobacco. "

1039
01:42:57,320 --> 01:43:01,438
"It could have all turned out differently,
I suppose. "

1040
01:43:02,560 --> 01:43:04,915
"But it didn't. "

1041
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:12,275
By the way,
I spoke to a John Ward at Edgerton's,

1042
01:43:12,480 --> 01:43:16,598
- He said he'd be willing to publish.
- My stories?

1043
01:43:16,800 --> 01:43:21,828
At our expense, of course,
but you'd keep 1 0% of the profits.

1044
01:43:23,200 --> 01:43:25,156
I was thinking of a title.

1045
01:43:25,360 --> 01:43:30,434
"Effusions of fancy by a very young girl
in a style entirely new."

1046
01:43:31,320 --> 01:43:35,552
- What do you think?
- That's...very interesting!

1047
01:43:36,840 --> 01:43:38,319
- Just interesting?
- It's terrible!

1048
01:43:38,520 --> 01:43:41,034
That's a terrible name!

1049
01:43:41,240 --> 01:43:43,629
But you're lovely.

1050
01:43:43,840 --> 01:43:46,752
Well, I guess that's all right, then!
