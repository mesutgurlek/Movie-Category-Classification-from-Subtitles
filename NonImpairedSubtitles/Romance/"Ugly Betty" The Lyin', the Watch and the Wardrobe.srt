3
00:00:09,816 --> 00:00:10,985
Marc!

4
00:00:11,566 --> 00:00:14,760
That is the absolute cruelest
thing I've ever seen.

5
00:00:16,078 --> 00:00:18,300
Someone's getting a raise.

6
00:00:21,347 --> 00:00:23,227
Betty, come here!

7
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:26,750
Dad!

8
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,021
In the kitchen.
I've been waiting for breakfast forever.

9
00:00:30,031 --> 00:00:33,371
Yeah, well, I need to talk to you first.
It's kind of important.

10
00:00:34,186 --> 00:00:35,942
Dad.

11
00:00:36,463 --> 00:00:37,913
Dad!

12
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:42,043
I told you,
I've been waiting forever.

13
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:43,157
Good one.

14
00:00:43,165 --> 00:00:46,273
Dad, I just talked to the H.M.O.
lady, and there's no mistake.

15
00:00:46,285 --> 00:00:49,813
When they pulled up your social security
number, it says that you're 117 years old,

16
00:00:49,828 --> 00:00:51,681
and, oh, yeah, dead.

17
00:00:51,697 --> 00:00:54,160
Yeah? Well,
I still look better than this guy.

18
00:00:54,178 --> 00:00:56,230
Justin, you're gonna be late!

19
00:00:56,245 --> 00:00:58,641
Papi, I only work a half a day,
and then I'll be able

20
00:00:58,658 --> 00:01:00,341
to come home and help
you decorate the outside.

21
00:01:00,375 --> 00:01:02,630
Don't forget the candy, and make sure
you get the good stuff this year.

22
00:01:02,667 --> 00:01:05,190
I don't want to be known as
the "raisin house" again.

23
00:01:05,208 --> 00:01:06,492
You're just asking
to get egged.

24
00:01:06,508 --> 00:01:08,231
Happy halloween!

25
00:01:08,248 --> 00:01:09,643
Guess who I am.

26
00:01:09,655 --> 00:01:12,043
Why, you're a proud member
of America's Navy, sir.

27
00:01:12,055 --> 00:01:14,453
No. I'm Gene Kelly
from "On the town."

28
00:01:14,467 --> 00:01:17,400
Well, let's just tell everybody
at school you're a sailor, okay?

29
00:01:17,415 --> 00:01:20,243
Fine, but I'm a sailor
that can sing and tap.

30
00:01:20,256 --> 00:01:22,890
# New York, New York, #
# a hell of a town #

31
00:01:22,906 --> 00:01:25,360
# The Bronx is up, #
# and the battery's down #

32
00:01:25,378 --> 00:01:27,130
# New York, New York #

33
00:01:27,147 --> 00:01:29,603
# You're a hell of a town #

34
00:01:29,788 --> 00:01:31,342
And dance break.

35
00:01:33,265 --> 00:01:36,162
Better hope he can sing
and tap and throw a punch.

36
00:01:36,727 --> 00:01:38,470
So you and Walter
got plans tonight?

37
00:01:38,485 --> 00:01:39,761
Yeah, we're gonna
pass out candy,

38
00:01:39,795 --> 00:01:41,931
and then we're gonna go to
a midnight showing of "Saw."

39
00:01:41,965 --> 00:01:43,620
Oh, that's sweet.

40
00:01:43,636 --> 00:01:45,280
See? You did the right
thing taking him back.

41
00:01:45,315 --> 00:01:47,213
You would not want to
watch that movie alone.

42
00:01:47,225 --> 00:01:48,401
We're just dating.

43
00:01:48,416 --> 00:01:50,610
So listen,
just now I told the H.M.O. lady

44
00:01:50,626 --> 00:01:53,381
- that there had to be a mistake--
- What mistake?

45
00:01:53,397 --> 00:01:55,452
There's this whole mix-up with
dad's social security number.

46
00:01:55,486 --> 00:01:56,940
They say it belongs
to a dead guy.

47
00:01:56,956 --> 00:02:00,031
That's why they're not, you know,
they're not covering him anymore.

48
00:02:00,048 --> 00:02:02,243
What? Dad.

49
00:02:13,885 --> 00:02:15,563
Are you finished?

50
00:02:15,575 --> 00:02:17,660
Come on. That was good stuff.

51
00:02:17,678 --> 00:02:19,750
I tried it on the
paperboy this morning.

52
00:02:19,767 --> 00:02:21,481
He peed himself.

53
00:02:21,498 --> 00:02:22,620
I gotta go.

54
00:02:22,636 --> 00:02:24,663
Me, too.
Look, dad, I'm serious.

55
00:02:24,678 --> 00:02:26,210
You need to go down there
and show them you're alive.

56
00:02:26,246 --> 00:02:28,120
They think I'm crazy.

57
00:02:29,476 --> 00:02:31,442
Marc, I need you to
go down to the closet

58
00:02:31,457 --> 00:02:34,771
and tell that drunken irishwoman to
bring up my gown for the Halloween ball.

59
00:02:34,785 --> 00:02:36,550
- She's scottish, actually.
- Don't care.

60
00:02:36,568 --> 00:02:39,492
Of course not.
You may want to return some of these.

61
00:02:39,506 --> 00:02:42,380
Calvin needs to reschedule a lunch,
Karl wants to know

62
00:02:42,395 --> 00:02:46,793
if you're gonna be in St.
Moritz for the holiday, and, um...

63
00:02:46,805 --> 00:02:48,843
Nico's called twice.

64
00:02:48,855 --> 00:02:51,763
Don't spoil my morning yet.
I'm in too good a mood.

65
00:02:53,115 --> 00:02:55,530
So your date last
night went well?

66
00:02:55,545 --> 00:02:56,873
Oh, yes.

67
00:02:56,886 --> 00:02:59,630
Jason dipped his toe
into lake Wilhelmina,

68
00:02:59,647 --> 00:03:03,721
and let's just say,
the water was very warm.

69
00:03:03,735 --> 00:03:06,113
I'm not really sure I
wanna know what that means.

70
00:03:06,126 --> 00:03:08,571
It's refreshing to be with
someone who knows how to...

71
00:03:08,587 --> 00:03:10,783
keep... up.

72
00:03:10,795 --> 00:03:13,203
I invited him to the
Halloween ball tonight.

73
00:03:13,218 --> 00:03:15,142
A second date? Oh, my.

74
00:03:15,155 --> 00:03:18,700
Well, how could I resist?
We just look so good together.

75
00:03:18,885 --> 00:03:21,711
Apparently, you're not the
only one who thinks so.

76
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:24,383
Well, unless that was
her secret love child,

77
00:03:24,395 --> 00:03:26,182
somebody  should have called
the cops last night,

78
00:03:26,215 --> 00:03:29,181
because "Mode" magazine's Wilhelmina
Slater is most definitely

79
00:03:29,198 --> 00:03:30,613
robbing the cradle.

80
00:03:30,628 --> 00:03:32,520
But someone really should
tell that woman that

81
00:03:32,537 --> 00:03:36,163
wearing a young man on your arm
doesn't always cover the parts that...

82
00:03:36,177 --> 00:03:37,343
jiggle.

83
00:03:37,358 --> 00:03:39,073
Can't we just give her a
lifetime achievement award

84
00:03:39,105 --> 00:03:41,212
and put her out of our misery?

85
00:03:42,778 --> 00:03:45,481
Would you like to return
some of those calls?

86
00:03:45,835 --> 00:03:49,033
I'd like you to call Jason.
Tell him tonight is off.

87
00:03:49,046 --> 00:03:51,370
But... you like him.

88
00:03:51,385 --> 00:03:54,913
Too bad. He's making me look
like miss Jane Pittman.

89
00:03:54,925 --> 00:03:58,943
Flip through my rolodex.
Find someone else to escort me tonight.

90
00:03:59,067 --> 00:04:01,290
And take that
ridiculous costume off.

91
00:04:01,305 --> 00:04:04,151
I can barely stand
looking at the real one.

92
00:04:14,155 --> 00:04:15,023
Gotcha.

93
00:04:15,038 --> 00:04:17,201
Walter, you almost gave
me a heart attack.

94
00:04:17,218 --> 00:04:19,491
Happy Halloween.

95
00:04:20,615 --> 00:04:22,870
For you.
Bigger than last year's.

96
00:04:22,886 --> 00:04:24,500
Well, you got me the
cherry sour balls.

97
00:04:24,516 --> 00:04:25,930
See? I know what you like.

98
00:04:25,948 --> 00:04:28,621
And there's a, uh,
little surprise on the bottom,

99
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:30,191
but you have to
eat your way to it.

100
00:04:30,205 --> 00:04:31,221
- Okay.
- No cheating.

101
00:04:31,236 --> 00:04:33,002
Okay. Thank you.

102
00:04:33,016 --> 00:04:35,451
Look, I'm gonna see you tonigh
I'm late for work. I gotta go.

103
00:04:35,468 --> 00:04:38,152
- Okay. I'm gonna miss you.
- Okay.

104
00:04:40,025 --> 00:04:41,443
Walter.

105
00:04:41,455 --> 00:04:43,070
You didn't say you'll miss me.

106
00:04:43,085 --> 00:04:46,502
I miss you. I will.

107
00:04:50,286 --> 00:04:52,310
Ta-da!

108
00:04:52,995 --> 00:04:55,552
Let me guess,
when you got on the elevator downstairs,

109
00:04:55,566 --> 00:04:56,950
you were a caterpillar.

110
00:04:56,968 --> 00:04:58,321
Where are your costumes?

111
00:04:58,337 --> 00:05:01,730
What about the e-mail you sent me
about the "Mode" costume contest?

112
00:05:01,745 --> 00:05:07,433
Which... was...
obviously sent only to me.

113
00:05:07,448 --> 00:05:08,760
Right.

114
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:12,062
Well, then.
I guess this means I win.

115
00:05:16,767 --> 00:05:19,442
Uh... okay.
Uh, I have a job for you.

116
00:05:19,456 --> 00:05:21,121
Great. Fire away.

117
00:05:21,137 --> 00:05:23,583
I need you to find my watch.

118
00:05:23,778 --> 00:05:25,151
Found it.

119
00:05:25,165 --> 00:05:27,493
My other watch.
It's a Simon Kouveaux.

120
00:05:27,506 --> 00:05:31,302
It was a gift. I'm pretty sure I left
it at some woman's apartment last week.

121
00:05:31,315 --> 00:05:33,062
I just, uh,
need it for the ball tonight.

122
00:05:33,076 --> 00:05:34,873
Are you gonna see the
woman who gave it to you?

123
00:05:34,907 --> 00:05:37,371
No. I'm seeing Simon Kouveaux.
He's cohosting.

124
00:05:37,386 --> 00:05:39,592
He gets very bitchy when
you're not wearing his line.

125
00:05:39,606 --> 00:05:43,121
Okay. Well, you just tell me who
this woman is, and I'll ask her.

126
00:05:43,137 --> 00:05:47,192
Right. Except I don't
exactly remember who it was.

127
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:50,010
You don't remember
who you slept with?

128
00:05:50,026 --> 00:05:52,402
Yes, I remember who I slept with,
and don't give me the look.

129
00:05:52,436 --> 00:05:53,292
What look?

130
00:05:53,305 --> 00:05:55,383
That look--
the all-judging butterfly.

131
00:05:55,398 --> 00:05:58,260
And not only do I remember
who I slept with,

132
00:05:58,276 --> 00:06:00,392
I even have some
of their numbers.

133
00:06:00,406 --> 00:06:02,760
Although  you have to match up the
names with the nights of the week.

134
00:06:02,795 --> 00:06:04,831
I'm kinda fuzzy on that part.

135
00:06:04,847 --> 00:06:07,792
- Is this the look?
- I had a crazy week, okay?

136
00:06:07,806 --> 00:06:10,561
Do you even remember what you
had for--for lunch on tuesday?

137
00:06:10,575 --> 00:06:13,191
Spinach pie.
The cafeteria was celebrating greek day.

138
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:13,972
It was good.

139
00:06:13,985 --> 00:06:15,680
Why is this such
a problem for you?

140
00:06:15,698 --> 00:06:18,351
I'm an adult, okay?
These women are adults.

141
00:06:18,368 --> 00:06:20,561
Believe me, I checked.
No one's getting hurt.

142
00:06:20,575 --> 00:06:22,661
I can sleep with a different
woman every night of the week

143
00:06:22,696 --> 00:06:24,613
because... why not?

144
00:06:24,623 --> 00:06:25,953
You know,
the romans had a 9-day week.

145
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:28,053
You would have been a
really tired centurion.

146
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:31,107
Just find the watch. If you have to
run out, have Amanda cover the phones.

147
00:06:31,116 --> 00:06:33,630
- I'm gonna be out of the office.
- Oh. You have an appointment.

148
00:06:33,646 --> 00:06:36,360
Cancel it.
I'm gonna be back in the afternoon.

149
00:06:40,545 --> 00:06:42,431
I thought you were
handling this.

150
00:06:42,447 --> 00:06:43,753
I am handling this.

151
00:06:43,765 --> 00:06:45,480
Well, who gave my
son the music box?

152
00:06:45,498 --> 00:06:48,150
Who's filling his head with
stories about me and Fey?

153
00:06:48,167 --> 00:06:50,250
You tell me.
Who knew about you two?

154
00:06:50,268 --> 00:06:52,303
Not Daniel.
That's the whole point.

155
00:06:52,317 --> 00:06:54,473
I spent a lifetime trying to
protect him from knowing,

156
00:06:54,475 --> 00:06:58,813
and now this...
someone is ruining it.

157
00:06:58,828 --> 00:07:02,093
This is my family.
Do you understand?

158
00:07:02,105 --> 00:07:03,963
Understood.

159
00:07:10,235 --> 00:07:12,040
Anyway, look, if you've got it,

160
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:14,392
please call me back as
soon as you can. Thanks.

161
00:07:14,408 --> 00:07:16,523
Is this why you
called me over here--

162
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:18,143
to watch your phone skills?

163
00:07:18,155 --> 00:07:20,030
'Cause they are really great.

164
00:07:20,045 --> 00:07:21,541
No. I need you to help
me cover the phones.

165
00:07:21,575 --> 00:07:25,111
Daniel left his watch in
some woman's apartment and--

166
00:07:25,485 --> 00:07:27,772
Please. Like I care?

167
00:07:27,788 --> 00:07:29,333
We're hardly exclusive.

168
00:07:29,347 --> 00:07:33,341
It's not like I spend my evenings
thumbing through "Modern Bride."

169
00:07:36,746 --> 00:07:38,430
How many women are you calling?

170
00:07:38,448 --> 00:07:40,450
Well, he doesn't seem to remember
exactly when it happened,

171
00:07:40,485 --> 00:07:42,691
so I'm calling one woman
for each night of the week.

172
00:07:42,705 --> 00:07:44,062
- Priceless.
- And I need you to help me

173
00:07:44,097 --> 00:07:46,641
find addresses for miss
tuesday and wednesday.

174
00:07:46,657 --> 00:07:48,721
Nymphalis milberti?

175
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:51,431
Oh, nymphalis milberti.

176
00:07:51,968 --> 00:07:53,462
Milbert's tortoiseshell?

177
00:07:53,475 --> 00:07:54,683
Uh, I don't--I don't know.

178
00:07:54,697 --> 00:07:56,932
Uh, the pattern just
said "butterfly."

179
00:07:56,946 --> 00:07:58,660
Well, just something I know.

180
00:07:58,675 --> 00:08:00,893
One of several
things, actually.

181
00:08:00,905 --> 00:08:03,150
Circumference of the earth?
Know it.

182
00:08:03,167 --> 00:08:06,670
And this concludes another
episode of "True, but dull."

183
00:08:06,688 --> 00:08:09,360
Well, I should probably get
back down to accounting.

184
00:08:09,377 --> 00:08:12,213
We paid a guy 50 bucks to see
how much honey he can drink

185
00:08:12,228 --> 00:08:14,611
before he makes himself sick.

186
00:08:15,687 --> 00:08:19,001
Well, you should come down
later if--if you can.

187
00:08:19,016 --> 00:08:20,911
Oh, um, o-okay.

188
00:08:20,925 --> 00:08:23,841
Yeah, maybe, uh,
if I have the time.

189
00:08:24,877 --> 00:08:28,281
24,901 miles.

190
00:08:29,457 --> 00:08:33,350
The circumference of the earth--
it's just something I know.

191
00:08:37,995 --> 00:08:40,050
Oh, my god.

192
00:08:40,067 --> 00:08:42,760
Were you just flirting with
Henry from accounting?

193
00:08:42,776 --> 00:08:44,432
I should get, like,
workman's comp or something.

194
00:08:44,466 --> 00:08:46,372
I was not flirting.

195
00:08:46,386 --> 00:08:48,503
Why, was he?

196
00:08:48,697 --> 00:08:50,392
What is this?

197
00:08:50,408 --> 00:08:52,992
Oh.  Walter puts a surprise
in there for me every year.

198
00:08:53,007 --> 00:08:55,352
Last year it was an engraved
cell phone holster.

199
00:08:58,048 --> 00:09:00,330
What's the key for?

200
00:09:01,015 --> 00:09:03,323
It goes with the note.

201
00:09:03,336 --> 00:09:05,881
He wants me to
move in with him.

202
00:09:21,317 --> 00:09:25,202
Yeah, well,
I can see why you're nervous.

203
00:09:25,217 --> 00:09:27,703
I  mean, you two have only
just started dating again.

204
00:09:27,715 --> 00:09:31,200
And let's face it, he is the boy who
dumped you for the neighborhood hoochie.

205
00:09:31,215 --> 00:09:34,221
Yeah, but he's also
done everything short

206
00:09:34,238 --> 00:09:38,080
of skywriting "forgive
me" to win me back.

207
00:09:38,095 --> 00:09:41,441
In four years,
he's never once forgotten my birthday,

208
00:09:41,465 --> 00:09:45,012
and if I just sniffle,
he's at my door with chicken soup.

209
00:09:45,498 --> 00:09:48,561
He's also the only
guy I've ever...

210
00:09:50,717 --> 00:09:52,541
Oh, yeah.

211
00:09:52,557 --> 00:09:55,730
I don't want to say no now
and risk losing him forever.

212
00:09:55,746 --> 00:09:58,900
Sorry, but that's a poor,
poor reason to say yes.

213
00:09:58,915 --> 00:10:00,881
He's the only boy
you've ever known.

214
00:10:00,896 --> 00:10:03,151
He might turn out to
be the first pancake.

215
00:10:03,167 --> 00:10:04,441
- The what?
- The practice one.

216
00:10:04,457 --> 00:10:05,933
The one you toss away.

217
00:10:05,946 --> 00:10:07,762
I don't toss away pancakes.

218
00:10:07,776 --> 00:10:10,761
Well, I'm only saying, you've only
just come out of your cocoon.

219
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:12,903
Why don't you just spread
your wings a wee bit?

220
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:15,473
You know, see what's out there
before you settle back in.

221
00:10:15,485 --> 00:10:17,091
See who's out there.

222
00:10:17,108 --> 00:10:18,911
Anyway, I have to go
find Daniel's watch,

223
00:10:18,927 --> 00:10:21,051
so I'm gonna move now.
If I throw up, I'm sorry.

224
00:10:21,067 --> 00:10:23,462
Remember, Betty,
butterflies don't mate for life.

225
00:10:23,475 --> 00:10:25,270
You don't be afraid to
get yourself out there.

226
00:10:25,308 --> 00:10:28,691
You know,
test a few more flowers. Flit.

227
00:10:28,788 --> 00:10:32,432
Flit is what butterflies do.

228
00:10:33,196 --> 00:10:36,182
I thought you were
cursing at me in scottish.

229
00:10:41,928 --> 00:10:43,413
Hi there.

230
00:10:43,426 --> 00:10:44,762
Uh, I don't keep
candy in the house,

231
00:10:44,798 --> 00:10:46,480
and you're way too
old to be doing this.

232
00:10:46,497 --> 00:10:48,942
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm not trick-or-treating.

233
00:10:48,955 --> 00:10:51,523
I work for Daniel Meade.
I left you a couple of messages.

234
00:10:51,536 --> 00:10:54,121
I don't know if you got them--
about him leaving something here?

235
00:10:54,136 --> 00:10:55,533
Yeah, I got the messages.

236
00:10:55,548 --> 00:10:58,473
Actually, I called him a
few times myself last week.

237
00:10:58,485 --> 00:11:00,993
Any idea why he
didn't call me back?

238
00:11:01,006 --> 00:11:03,692
No, uh,
but I'd be happy to investigate.

239
00:11:03,707 --> 00:11:05,803
So, what,
you do his dirty work for him?

240
00:11:05,818 --> 00:11:08,382
What does he think I am?
Some kind of scratching post?

241
00:11:08,398 --> 00:11:11,363
Some kind of call girl?
He sends his secretary to blow me off?

242
00:11:11,377 --> 00:11:12,863
I'm really more
of an assistant.

243
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:14,363
You wonder if Daniel
left something here?

244
00:11:14,397 --> 00:11:15,923
Well, yeah,
he left something here--

245
00:11:15,935 --> 00:11:19,143
the last chance for
happiness he'll ever have.

246
00:11:22,908 --> 00:11:24,763
And these.

247
00:11:37,258 --> 00:11:38,403
Help you?

248
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:41,830
Uh, yeah, I'm just, uh,
here to see one of your, um...

249
00:11:42,278 --> 00:11:44,541
- uh, your...
- Are you checking in?

250
00:11:44,558 --> 00:11:47,542
No, no, no, no. God, no.
I'm, uh, just, uh, guest.

251
00:11:47,555 --> 00:11:50,131
Visitor. Uh,
I'm a relative of--

252
00:11:50,146 --> 00:11:51,600
Could you excuse me?

253
00:11:51,617 --> 00:11:53,803
Hey. Did you find the watch?

254
00:11:53,815 --> 00:11:55,292
I'm narrowing it down.

255
00:11:55,305 --> 00:11:57,601
Hey, listen. What do you think
about sending something like flowers

256
00:11:57,637 --> 00:11:59,593
before I knock on
these women's doors?

257
00:11:59,607 --> 00:12:01,190
Wait. I'm getting beeped.

258
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:03,282
It could be tuesday,
wednesday or thursday.

259
00:12:03,297 --> 00:12:04,180
Hello.

260
00:12:04,197 --> 00:12:05,941
Hey. You finished
your candy yet?

261
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:08,642
Walter, um,
I can't talk right now.

262
00:12:08,655 --> 00:12:10,893
Okay. Just tell me
what layer you're on.

263
00:12:10,908 --> 00:12:12,471
How close are you to the
bottom of your bucket?

264
00:12:12,507 --> 00:12:14,730
I'm not. Look, this is--
it's just, it's not a good time.

265
00:12:14,768 --> 00:12:16,003
Can I call you back?

266
00:12:16,787 --> 00:12:19,543
- Daniel.
- So why flowers? Is someone upset?

267
00:12:19,557 --> 00:12:22,213
Well, miss friday's face
did get all red and sweaty,

268
00:12:22,228 --> 00:12:25,023
but not like a person sweats,
more like a cheese sweats.

269
00:12:25,038 --> 00:12:28,253
Okay, fine. Flowers. Just tell Amanda
to send a dozen roses to each,

270
00:12:28,267 --> 00:12:30,832
and I'll check back in later.
All right. Bye.

271
00:12:31,265 --> 00:12:33,602
Um, Claire Meade, please.

272
00:12:33,618 --> 00:12:35,711
And who shall I
say is visiting?

273
00:12:35,728 --> 00:12:37,052
Her son.

274
00:12:37,066 --> 00:12:38,771
Possible escorts.

275
00:12:38,786 --> 00:12:40,481
Old.

276
00:12:41,965 --> 00:12:43,813
Way too old.

277
00:12:46,025 --> 00:12:49,531
Marc, I think this one's
face is on our money.

278
00:12:49,547 --> 00:12:53,840
You said you wanted one that
made you look young... ger.

279
00:12:53,858 --> 00:12:56,421
How about finding me
someone who doesn't leak?

280
00:12:57,537 --> 00:13:00,871
Oh, she's a little fragile today,
so be nice.

281
00:13:00,886 --> 00:13:02,513
- I'm always nice.
- You're never nice.

282
00:13:02,527 --> 00:13:05,280
You know, you're right.
I was thinking about somebody else.

283
00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:11,041
And this is where we come to
lose ourselves in the classics.

284
00:13:11,055 --> 00:13:13,023
It's, uh, a nice collection.

285
00:13:13,035 --> 00:13:14,592
It is.

286
00:13:14,606 --> 00:13:17,431
Nothing like making people
in detox read stories

287
00:13:17,446 --> 00:13:19,683
cooked up by a bunch of drunks.

288
00:13:19,696 --> 00:13:22,442
Did your father tell you
they confiscated my perfume?

289
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:24,622
I guess they are
worried you might--

290
00:13:24,638 --> 00:13:27,432
What? Drink it?

291
00:13:27,446 --> 00:13:29,452
Oh, come on, Daniel.

292
00:13:29,467 --> 00:13:32,820
Bad enough I can't board first
class with my liquid eyeliner.

293
00:13:32,835 --> 00:13:35,790
Now  I have to walk
around smelling like...

294
00:13:35,807 --> 00:13:37,720
people.

295
00:13:37,738 --> 00:13:39,360
So why are you here?

296
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:40,853
Just to talk.

297
00:13:40,865 --> 00:13:43,771
Well, I've been right here,
any time you wanted to come.

298
00:13:43,785 --> 00:13:45,970
I've just been very busy
the last couple of weeks.

299
00:13:45,986 --> 00:13:47,301
Almost four.

300
00:13:47,317 --> 00:13:49,693
They like to tell you just
how many days you've been in

301
00:13:49,707 --> 00:13:51,822
so it passes more slowly.

302
00:13:51,837 --> 00:13:55,231
Today is sponsored
by the number 26.

303
00:13:55,447 --> 00:13:58,721
I want to talk
about Fey Sommers.

304
00:13:59,377 --> 00:14:01,252
Then I'm going to need
a lunch someplace

305
00:14:01,267 --> 00:14:04,821
where they're not
serving pudding cups.

306
00:14:05,735 --> 00:14:07,923
All right.
I'll explain it one more time.

307
00:14:07,936 --> 00:14:10,291
Um,  he misplaced his watch,
and he thinks he may have

308
00:14:10,305 --> 00:14:13,550
left it at your apartment on...
thursday night.

309
00:14:13,566 --> 00:14:16,073
No, and why didn't he
just come here himself?

310
00:14:16,086 --> 00:14:18,720
Because... you see,
Daniel is...

311
00:14:18,736 --> 00:14:20,853
well, he's out of the
office most of the day.

312
00:14:20,867 --> 00:14:22,531
Because, you know,
we had something special.

313
00:14:22,566 --> 00:14:27,100
I mean, I let him stay over.
I let him use my toothbrush.

314
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:28,802
I even gave him
the good pillow.

315
00:14:28,816 --> 00:14:31,360
Why would he say all those
things to me and not call me?

316
00:14:31,377 --> 00:14:33,452
It just doesn't make...

317
00:14:33,596 --> 00:14:37,641
Oh, my god!
You're trying to sabotage us.

318
00:14:37,658 --> 00:14:39,280
Are you sleeping with him?

319
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:42,021
Okay, um, look. I'm just going
to write you down as a "no."

320
00:14:42,036 --> 00:14:45,390
Because I will not give
him up without a fight!

321
00:14:49,318 --> 00:14:52,463
Ew. I give up.
How old is old to you?

322
00:14:52,477 --> 00:14:54,523
Ew. Older than my dad.

323
00:14:54,538 --> 00:14:55,980
Hey, what's he doing tonight?

324
00:14:55,996 --> 00:14:58,923
Mm. Drinking,
embezzling, apologizing.

325
00:14:58,936 --> 00:15:01,092
He has a very full life.

326
00:15:01,106 --> 00:15:03,863
"Mode" magazine.
How may I direct your call?

327
00:15:04,635 --> 00:15:08,070
Aw, someone's turning
back into a caterpillar.

328
00:15:08,086 --> 00:15:10,443
Do you have those two
addresses I asked you to get?

329
00:15:10,456 --> 00:15:11,410
Still working on it.

330
00:15:11,428 --> 00:15:13,761
Can I borrow your
stapler, please?

331
00:15:20,798 --> 00:15:23,132
- Can I help?
- Huh? Oh, no.

332
00:15:23,148 --> 00:15:24,722
I'm--I'm good. Thanks.

333
00:15:24,737 --> 00:15:26,821
Um, if you were good,
you could leave here

334
00:15:26,838 --> 00:15:29,161
and join Cirque du Soleil.

335
00:15:42,106 --> 00:15:43,602
That should do it.

336
00:15:43,846 --> 00:15:47,330
Now I want you to try to
avoid crowded subway cars.

337
00:15:47,347 --> 00:15:49,152
Oh, and blue jays.

338
00:15:49,167 --> 00:15:51,081
Natural predators.

339
00:15:51,097 --> 00:15:53,441
Right. Okay. Thanks.

340
00:15:53,456 --> 00:15:56,121
So anyway, uh, you think maybe

341
00:15:56,136 --> 00:15:58,232
you'd like to go get
some lunch later?

342
00:15:58,245 --> 00:15:59,900
What? No.

343
00:15:59,918 --> 00:16:02,800
Oh. Yeah. Okay.

344
00:16:02,846 --> 00:16:04,432
It's cool.

345
00:16:05,758 --> 00:16:08,643
No, yes! I meant yes.

346
00:16:08,656 --> 00:16:09,821
Yes?

347
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:11,970
If that's still okay.

348
00:16:12,227 --> 00:16:15,001
Yeah, well, I think--I think
I may still have an opening.

349
00:16:15,016 --> 00:16:16,691
- Okay.
- 12:30?

350
00:16:16,707 --> 00:16:20,060
Yeah. 12:30.

351
00:16:22,655 --> 00:16:24,663
So what about monday night?

352
00:16:24,675 --> 00:16:26,663
Isn't Daniel
sending her flowers?

353
00:16:26,677 --> 00:16:28,921
What? Oh, uh, no.

354
00:16:28,938 --> 00:16:31,402
He couldn't remember
who monday was.

355
00:16:47,495 --> 00:16:49,311
Ow. Ow.

356
00:16:49,327 --> 00:16:50,841
Sorry.

357
00:16:51,515 --> 00:16:53,441
What are you doing back there?

358
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:54,822
Did you screw up the zipper?

359
00:16:54,836 --> 00:16:56,072
No, the zipper's
not the problem.

360
00:16:56,105 --> 00:16:58,832
The lack of a pulley and several
burly men is the problem.

361
00:16:58,847 --> 00:17:00,092
What is she saying to me?

362
00:17:00,107 --> 00:17:02,070
Nothing. It's the beer talking.

363
00:17:02,086 --> 00:17:04,922
Maybe you bought
the wrong size!

364
00:17:04,937 --> 00:17:06,511
I ordered a 2.

365
00:17:06,527 --> 00:17:08,702
She has always been a 2,
but clearly, someone has been

366
00:17:08,718 --> 00:17:11,602
enjoying far too many
complimentary cheese straws.

367
00:17:11,618 --> 00:17:13,621
I understood that.
What are you saying,

368
00:17:13,638 --> 00:17:14,942
- Carlotta?
- Christina.

369
00:17:14,956 --> 00:17:17,290
All I'm saying is that it
might be a slight possibility

370
00:17:17,308 --> 00:17:20,523
that she might--might
have just maybe gained...

371
00:17:20,538 --> 00:17:22,083
Gained what?

372
00:17:22,096 --> 00:17:25,330
What? Nothing.
Just maybe a little...

373
00:17:25,346 --> 00:17:28,360
wee bit of... weight?

374
00:17:39,096 --> 00:17:42,111
So how are you?
Are you seeing anyone?

375
00:17:42,128 --> 00:17:45,053
Not any one person.
You know, a few.

376
00:17:45,065 --> 00:17:47,271
Our compliments, Mrs. Meade.

377
00:17:47,288 --> 00:17:49,952
Good to see you.
It's been far too long.

378
00:17:49,966 --> 00:17:52,130
Yes, it has.

379
00:17:52,148 --> 00:17:53,281
Hey, that's mine.

380
00:17:53,298 --> 00:17:55,170
- Give that to me.
- Don't even start.

381
00:17:55,188 --> 00:17:56,991
I'm going to have the veal marsala,
you know.

382
00:17:57,007 --> 00:17:58,873
You do realize that
it's made with wine?

383
00:17:58,885 --> 00:18:00,333
And the alcohol burns off.

384
00:18:00,348 --> 00:18:04,230
Then give me back the glass and
set fire to me when I'm done.

385
00:18:05,576 --> 00:18:09,070
So are we gonna talk
about that Christmas?

386
00:18:10,286 --> 00:18:11,390
What Christmas?

387
00:18:11,405 --> 00:18:13,681
That Christmas. I was 12.

388
00:18:13,695 --> 00:18:16,083
Dad gave you a music box he
brought back from Zurich.

389
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:19,262
One minute you're smiling, the next
you're using a crème brûlée torch

390
00:18:19,278 --> 00:18:22,051
to set fire to a thousand
copies of "Mode."

391
00:18:22,065 --> 00:18:26,532
No? It was the Christmas you found
out about dad's affair with Fey.

392
00:18:26,545 --> 00:18:28,613
Oh, yes.

393
00:18:28,716 --> 00:18:31,383
That does jingle a bell.

394
00:18:33,667 --> 00:18:35,053
Betty, do you know
what you want?

395
00:18:35,068 --> 00:18:37,181
Um, I think I need
another minute?

396
00:18:37,196 --> 00:18:38,162
Okay.

397
00:18:38,175 --> 00:18:39,261
Have you been here before?

398
00:18:39,275 --> 00:18:43,393
Because the caterpillar roll is awesome.
No offense.

399
00:18:46,007 --> 00:18:50,672
Um, number four looks
like an autopsy photo?

400
00:18:50,687 --> 00:18:53,312
I'm sorry. Sorry.
Totally inappropriate.

401
00:18:53,327 --> 00:18:54,832
Is this the first time
you've had sushi?

402
00:18:54,865 --> 00:18:57,361
No. God, no. Yes.

403
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:59,942
- Then let's go somewhere else.
- No, no, no, no, no. Please, please.

404
00:18:59,977 --> 00:19:02,181
It's good for me to try new things,
you know?

405
00:19:02,198 --> 00:19:03,841
Spread my wings.

406
00:19:04,328 --> 00:19:06,722
- Oh, my gosh. I'm so sorry.
- It's okay, it's okay.

407
00:19:06,737 --> 00:19:08,302
I'm sorry.

408
00:19:09,008 --> 00:19:13,112
All evidence to the contrary,
this is not my first time in public.

409
00:19:13,126 --> 00:19:14,452
It is mine.

410
00:19:14,467 --> 00:19:17,821
For parolees, these ankle
bracelets are the best thing ever.

411
00:19:19,678 --> 00:19:21,251
It's so stupid, you know.

412
00:19:21,265 --> 00:19:23,373
I come into Manhattan
every single day for work,

413
00:19:23,386 --> 00:19:24,971
and it's times like
these where I feel like

414
00:19:25,005 --> 00:19:27,712
the e-train dropped me
off on mars or something.

415
00:19:27,725 --> 00:19:30,503
Where I come from,
people like their fish cooked,

416
00:19:30,517 --> 00:19:33,770
and they dress up
for Halloween.

417
00:19:37,988 --> 00:19:40,101
Secret identity.

418
00:19:43,846 --> 00:19:47,773
Ay, something is burning.
What is that?

419
00:19:47,785 --> 00:19:51,161
It's blood--my dinner.

420
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:54,813
Okay, you're pushing it.

421
00:19:54,827 --> 00:19:56,830
Kids come here for candy,
not trauma.

422
00:19:56,845 --> 00:19:59,560
You can't have a haunted house
without spilling some blood.

423
00:19:59,576 --> 00:20:01,383
You know,
when Betty was a little girl, she--

424
00:20:01,398 --> 00:20:04,221
Okay, papi,
Betty is not a little girl anymore.

425
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:05,501
Neither am I.

426
00:20:05,516 --> 00:20:07,003
What are you talking about?

427
00:20:07,018 --> 00:20:09,791
Why does the H.M.O.
say you're dead?

428
00:20:11,415 --> 00:20:15,193
Why do they say that's not
your social security number?

429
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:18,982
Did you come home to help
me or to ask me questions?

430
00:20:18,997 --> 00:20:21,180
Because if you came to help me,

431
00:20:21,198 --> 00:20:23,322
hang this on the porch.

432
00:20:23,606 --> 00:20:26,960
Hi there. I'm calling from the
Sutton Place medical group.

433
00:20:26,978 --> 00:20:29,412
One of our patients,
Daniel Meade, just left here,

434
00:20:29,425 --> 00:20:31,120
and thought we should
give you a call.

435
00:20:31,138 --> 00:20:32,731
The good thing about scabies

436
00:20:32,748 --> 00:20:34,372
is if you treat the
itching right away,

437
00:20:34,388 --> 00:20:36,972
there's little chance of
them becoming open sores.

438
00:20:36,988 --> 00:20:41,102
You might want to call your doctor.
Okay. Bye-bye.

439
00:20:42,718 --> 00:20:45,470
Hi. I'm looking
for Betty Suarez.

440
00:20:45,488 --> 00:20:47,552
She's out to lunch.

441
00:20:50,628 --> 00:20:52,102
What?

442
00:20:52,115 --> 00:20:53,833
Do you know when
she'll be back?

443
00:20:53,848 --> 00:20:56,213
She's at the sushi bar across
the street with what's-his-face.

444
00:20:56,246 --> 00:20:58,342
Go ask her yourself.

445
00:20:58,927 --> 00:21:02,463
Hi there. I'm calling from the
medical group at Sutton Place.

446
00:21:02,478 --> 00:21:06,352
One of our patients, Daniel Meade,
thought we should give you a call.

447
00:21:07,058 --> 00:21:10,273
You can't imagine what it
was like seeing that woman

448
00:21:10,286 --> 00:21:13,172
holding my Christmas
present in that magazine.

449
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:15,073
Do you know that she actually
called the house several times

450
00:21:15,106 --> 00:21:17,930
and played the music from
that box on the phone?

451
00:21:17,947 --> 00:21:19,920
You made him end it then,
I assume?

452
00:21:19,935 --> 00:21:23,791
Of course, and I thought he had,
Daniel, I really did.

453
00:21:23,805 --> 00:21:25,371
So when did he?

454
00:21:25,388 --> 00:21:27,220
Well, let's see. It's been--

455
00:21:27,236 --> 00:21:29,413
I came here almost a month ago,

456
00:21:29,428 --> 00:21:31,770
so what I want to say is...

457
00:21:31,785 --> 00:21:33,101
six weeks.

458
00:21:33,116 --> 00:21:34,433
What?

459
00:21:34,445 --> 00:21:37,251
Dad was having an affair
with Fey for 20 years,

460
00:21:37,265 --> 00:21:38,282
and you didn't know?

461
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,001
Well, Daniel,
I don't know if you've noticed,

462
00:21:40,035 --> 00:21:42,453
but I drink quite a lot.

463
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:44,580
I-I just thought you
took after grandpa Jack.

464
00:21:44,598 --> 00:21:46,243
Well, that certainly
didn't help any.

465
00:21:46,258 --> 00:21:49,340
And there are certain things
one can inherit from a father--

466
00:21:49,355 --> 00:21:51,233
some of which
should concern you.

467
00:21:51,245 --> 00:21:53,431
- Such as?
- The philandering.

468
00:21:53,445 --> 00:21:56,201
You and all your women.
I see him in you.

469
00:21:56,217 --> 00:21:58,552
Daniel, it destroyed
our family.

470
00:21:58,568 --> 00:22:00,632
What made him finally end it?

471
00:22:00,648 --> 00:22:02,880
Does that really matter now?

472
00:22:02,896 --> 00:22:04,692
It might.

473
00:22:04,705 --> 00:22:07,390
Then give me a drink.

474
00:22:07,905 --> 00:22:09,321
Mom.

475
00:22:09,338 --> 00:22:13,450
A sip, that's all.
Then I tell you what you want to know.

476
00:22:20,008 --> 00:22:21,902
A sip.

477
00:22:39,536 --> 00:22:41,613
I made him choose.

478
00:22:42,535 --> 00:22:45,291
She wasn't going
anywhere on her own.

479
00:22:45,308 --> 00:22:48,092
So she and I went
over to his office,

480
00:22:48,107 --> 00:22:52,681
and we stood there in front of that big,
overcompensating desk of his,

481
00:22:52,697 --> 00:22:54,793
and we told him
to make a choice.

482
00:22:54,808 --> 00:22:56,173
Who'd he choose?

483
00:22:56,188 --> 00:22:59,810
Well, one of us is here,

484
00:22:59,826 --> 00:23:02,452
and one of us is dead.

485
00:23:02,468 --> 00:23:04,710
So you figure it out.

486
00:23:05,976 --> 00:23:10,702
So I noticed that you've been
on our floor quite a bit today.

487
00:23:10,715 --> 00:23:12,982
Have I? Hmm.

488
00:23:12,998 --> 00:23:15,302
Don't think it has
anything to do with you.

489
00:23:15,318 --> 00:23:17,222
No, I just like to make the rounds,
you know.

490
00:23:17,237 --> 00:23:19,622
Let the employees know that
accounting has its eye on 'em.

491
00:23:19,638 --> 00:23:20,761
Right.

492
00:23:20,778 --> 00:23:22,882
Here, this is your piece.

493
00:23:22,895 --> 00:23:24,371
Now close your eyes,

494
00:23:24,387 --> 00:23:26,332
but don't peek.

495
00:23:26,348 --> 00:23:28,613
This is how Tom Hanks
survived in "Cast Away."

496
00:23:28,628 --> 00:23:30,840
I don't think so.

497
00:23:31,167 --> 00:23:33,101
Walter.

498
00:23:36,608 --> 00:23:38,260
What are you--
what are you doing here?

499
00:23:38,277 --> 00:23:39,390
Who is this guy?

500
00:23:39,408 --> 00:23:43,580
This is, um, this is Henry.
He works on the third floor.

501
00:23:44,168 --> 00:23:46,510
Why haven't you
returned my calls?

502
00:23:46,526 --> 00:23:47,742
I got busy.

503
00:23:47,756 --> 00:23:49,840
- Busy? Busy?
- Maybe I should get the check.

504
00:23:49,858 --> 00:23:51,620
Busy with what? A date?

505
00:23:51,635 --> 00:23:54,293
I ask you to move in with me, and
you turn around, and you cheat on me?

506
00:23:54,326 --> 00:23:57,523
Walter, stop it.
You're embarrassing me.

507
00:23:58,197 --> 00:24:00,290
I'll pay the cashier.

508
00:24:00,306 --> 00:24:02,932
No, no, no, no.
You--you stay. I'll go.

509
00:24:02,948 --> 00:24:05,010
I embarrass her.

510
00:24:18,115 --> 00:24:20,853
Tighten the wrap, will you?

511
00:24:20,866 --> 00:24:23,930
I think I just felt
another pound drip off.

512
00:24:23,947 --> 00:24:26,051
Oh, my god. It's sweltering.

513
00:24:26,065 --> 00:24:27,733
Close the door.

514
00:24:27,765 --> 00:24:30,433
And crank up the
thermostat all the way.

515
00:24:30,447 --> 00:24:33,440
You know,
paper burns at 451 degrees.

516
00:24:33,455 --> 00:24:36,132
Good. You can become a science
teacher after I fire you.

517
00:24:36,148 --> 00:24:37,971
Now crank it!

518
00:24:38,266 --> 00:24:42,292
I know you don't want
to hear this, but...

519
00:24:42,315 --> 00:24:43,991
Nico called again.

520
00:24:44,005 --> 00:24:45,363
Of course I don't
want to hear it.

521
00:24:45,376 --> 00:24:47,953
I have six hours to
become ten years younger

522
00:24:47,965 --> 00:24:49,293
and 5 pounds thinner.

523
00:24:49,308 --> 00:24:53,440
Nico is exactly what I do
not need today. What is that?

524
00:24:53,576 --> 00:24:55,470
- Salad.
- Take it away.

525
00:24:55,488 --> 00:24:57,980
- You have to eat.
- Who's side are you on anyway?

526
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:59,883
Get out!

527
00:25:01,306 --> 00:25:04,202
Oh, maybe it's not as bad
as you're making it sound.

528
00:25:04,217 --> 00:25:06,910
Oh, no. It's--it's worse
than I'm making it sound.

529
00:25:06,926 --> 00:25:09,163
I'm downplaying it so I
don't completely freak out

530
00:25:09,175 --> 00:25:11,661
that I not only humiliated
myself in front of Henry,

531
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:13,820
but I probably lost
Walter forever.

532
00:25:13,835 --> 00:25:15,593
I am so sorry, Betty.

533
00:25:15,607 --> 00:25:18,133
I guess if it--it was--it was me.
I pushed you into it.

534
00:25:18,145 --> 00:25:20,563
It's not you.
It's not you. I did it.

535
00:25:20,577 --> 00:25:22,302
When I'm done with work,
I'm gonna find Walter,

536
00:25:22,337 --> 00:25:24,142
and I am gonna beg
him to forgive me.

537
00:25:24,158 --> 00:25:25,942
What, and say you're
gonna move in with him?

538
00:25:25,956 --> 00:25:27,632
Maybe, yeah.

539
00:25:27,647 --> 00:25:30,631
Some people like Daniel--
they can date tons of people at once.

540
00:25:30,648 --> 00:25:33,460
I tried two. No,
if there's one thing I learned today,

541
00:25:33,477 --> 00:25:35,802
it is that I am
not a flitter...

542
00:25:35,817 --> 00:25:37,802
and that my boss wears boxers.

543
00:25:37,818 --> 00:25:39,920
Silk boxers.

544
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:42,112
So I've heard.

545
00:25:45,685 --> 00:25:47,430
There you are.

546
00:25:47,447 --> 00:25:49,842
- Where you been?
- I ran out for a size 4.

547
00:25:49,857 --> 00:25:51,520
And if this Valentino doesn't fit her,
do you know what?

548
00:25:51,556 --> 00:25:52,862
I'm going to make her
wear the bloody drapes!

549
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:54,523
- She can't know.
- She won't know,

550
00:25:54,536 --> 00:25:58,481
because I plan on surgically removing
the evidence myself. Grubby fingers.

551
00:25:59,475 --> 00:26:02,461
Oh, and, Betty, listen.
Good luck with the... you know,

552
00:26:02,476 --> 00:26:05,011
and keep me posted. Yes?

553
00:26:10,456 --> 00:26:12,612
What are you staring at?

554
00:26:12,628 --> 00:26:15,353
I had the veal.
The alcohol burns off.

555
00:26:15,368 --> 00:26:16,930
Mom, please.

556
00:26:16,948 --> 00:26:20,183
Listen to me.
You have to go, I know, but listen.

557
00:26:20,195 --> 00:26:21,593
I want you to be careful...

558
00:26:21,606 --> 00:26:23,801
I know, of dating too many women.
I got it.

559
00:26:23,816 --> 00:26:27,440
Of your father.
I pushed him, and he stuck me here.

560
00:26:27,457 --> 00:26:28,953
I don't know what
he'd do to you.

561
00:26:28,966 --> 00:26:34,943
Mom, do you think dad
is capable of murder?

562
00:26:35,005 --> 00:26:38,143
I think your father is
capable of anything.

563
00:26:40,686 --> 00:26:43,530
Hey, Amanda, if Daniel ever calls,
will you tell him

564
00:26:43,548 --> 00:26:46,053
that I've gone out again
to try and get his watch?

565
00:26:46,068 --> 00:26:47,293
Who are those for?

566
00:26:47,305 --> 00:26:50,560
Oh, uh, tuesday's girl had already
left for her hostessing job

567
00:26:50,576 --> 00:26:55,623
or whatever when I called,
so I just sent her flowers to me.

568
00:26:55,636 --> 00:26:59,800
Hey, have you taken any messages
from Walter since lunch?

569
00:26:59,998 --> 00:27:01,501
Henry?

570
00:27:19,757 --> 00:27:21,683
You need to stop me from
going to see Henry.

571
00:27:21,697 --> 00:27:23,170
I thought you were
resolved on that.

572
00:27:23,186 --> 00:27:25,270
I was. Tell that to my finger.

573
00:27:25,288 --> 00:27:27,610
My finger wants me to push
the button to Henry's floor.

574
00:27:27,625 --> 00:27:30,873
It wants me to go tell him that
I had a wonderful time today.

575
00:27:30,887 --> 00:27:32,022
Ooh, cheeky finger.

576
00:27:32,035 --> 00:27:33,572
What's wrong with me?

577
00:27:33,588 --> 00:27:35,392
I'm turning into Daniel,
that's what.

578
00:27:35,406 --> 00:27:37,822
Soon I'm gonna be able to juggle
people's hearts like fruit

579
00:27:37,837 --> 00:27:39,261
and still sleep well at night.

580
00:27:39,275 --> 00:27:40,653
Number one,
you're nothing like Daniel,

581
00:27:40,688 --> 00:27:42,603
and number two,
he doesn't really do much sleeping,

582
00:27:42,637 --> 00:27:44,673
which is why he loses expensive
jewelry and can't remember

583
00:27:44,706 --> 00:27:46,912
who he shagged
last monday night.

584
00:27:46,926 --> 00:27:48,192
- Oh, my god.
- What?

585
00:27:48,205 --> 00:27:50,660
Roses. I have to go.

586
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:56,143
What?

587
00:27:56,156 --> 00:27:58,010
You sent yourself flowers.

588
00:27:58,027 --> 00:28:00,300
You're monday's girl.

589
00:28:05,428 --> 00:28:08,463
Where are you going? Come back!

590
00:28:13,307 --> 00:28:14,883
What the hell are you doing?

591
00:28:14,898 --> 00:28:16,962
Was this all just
one big joke to you--

592
00:28:16,978 --> 00:28:19,320
watching me run around the
city in butterfly suit,

593
00:28:19,336 --> 00:28:22,322
getting underwear thrown at my head?
All for laughs?

594
00:28:22,335 --> 00:28:24,700
Do I look like I'm laughing?

595
00:28:24,715 --> 00:28:25,980
Well, then why didn't
you say something

596
00:28:26,017 --> 00:28:28,001
if you had this watch
the entire time?

597
00:28:28,017 --> 00:28:29,420
Why?

598
00:28:29,438 --> 00:28:31,241
Maybe because I was
hoping that monday night

599
00:28:31,257 --> 00:28:34,240
was the one night of the week
your boss would remember.

600
00:28:34,256 --> 00:28:36,640
Stupid me, huh?

601
00:28:41,717 --> 00:28:44,782
Does Daniel know that you
feel this way about him?

602
00:28:44,796 --> 00:28:47,802
Please. He's Daniel Meade.

603
00:28:47,816 --> 00:28:49,930
Take a number and wait in line.

604
00:28:49,948 --> 00:28:52,241
I'm sure he feels the
same way about you, too.

605
00:28:52,255 --> 00:28:54,400
I mean, don't you two have
some kind of agreement?

606
00:28:54,416 --> 00:28:56,633
Yeah, he dates
anything that moves,

607
00:28:56,648 --> 00:29:00,260
and I agree to smile
and take their messages.

608
00:29:00,278 --> 00:29:03,853
And now I'm sending
them flowers, too.

609
00:29:03,866 --> 00:29:06,711
Amanda, if you knew who he was,

610
00:29:06,725 --> 00:29:09,223
why did you get so involved?

611
00:29:09,238 --> 00:29:11,033
Because...

612
00:29:11,048 --> 00:29:14,613
I thought he would get
sick of serial dating.

613
00:29:17,035 --> 00:29:19,352
I sure as hell am.

614
00:29:19,528 --> 00:29:21,841
And what if he doesn't?

615
00:29:22,446 --> 00:29:24,453
He will.

616
00:29:24,468 --> 00:29:26,843
I'll just wait.

617
00:29:28,037 --> 00:29:29,532
Here.

618
00:29:29,547 --> 00:29:31,632
Give this back to him.

619
00:29:31,807 --> 00:29:33,883
You can tell him how you feel.

620
00:29:36,655 --> 00:29:38,701
Nope, nope, nope.

621
00:29:41,876 --> 00:29:45,130
Hey. Guess what?

622
00:29:45,146 --> 00:29:47,151
What?

623
00:29:50,196 --> 00:29:53,052
This never happened.

624
00:29:57,127 --> 00:29:59,990
I want the truth.

625
00:30:00,008 --> 00:30:02,460
- Is this a size 4?
- It's the designers.

626
00:30:02,478 --> 00:30:06,002
They have a cruel streak when it
comes to... voluptuous women.

627
00:30:06,016 --> 00:30:07,482
- Where's the tag?
- I ate it.

628
00:30:07,495 --> 00:30:10,742
- Carlotta?
- Ooh! Yes, it's a 4.

629
00:30:15,038 --> 00:30:16,491
Let me.

630
00:30:16,505 --> 00:30:18,471
Oh, leave it.

631
00:30:18,895 --> 00:30:21,581
I can't deny it anymore.
It's happened.

632
00:30:21,595 --> 00:30:23,640
I've become a woman
of a certain age.

633
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:25,973
If you give me 20 minutes,
I could do something with pleats.

634
00:30:26,006 --> 00:30:28,143
I-I said leave it.

635
00:30:28,158 --> 00:30:31,202
I'm not gonna go to
that ridiculous party.

636
00:30:31,977 --> 00:30:36,290
I can't compete anymore with a
bevy of 22-year-old gym bodies.

637
00:30:36,307 --> 00:30:38,450
I mean, you starve yourself,
you pull yourself,

638
00:30:38,466 --> 00:30:40,851
you inject yourself,
you think you're safe,

639
00:30:40,867 --> 00:30:43,821
but they keep coming to the door,
younger and younger

640
00:30:43,835 --> 00:30:47,351
like a hail of bullets
until down you go.

641
00:30:47,887 --> 00:30:50,772
Why is it such a crime
to age in this business?

642
00:30:50,786 --> 00:30:53,883
It's true.
The standards for women are so punitive.

643
00:30:53,895 --> 00:30:55,280
And whose fault is that?

644
00:30:55,296 --> 00:30:57,392
I set the standards.

645
00:30:57,405 --> 00:31:00,990
Lifetime achievement award.
Oh, there's my achievement.

646
00:31:01,006 --> 00:31:04,981
It bit me in the
ass and the hips.

647
00:31:05,857 --> 00:31:07,513
Serves me right, huh?

648
00:31:07,525 --> 00:31:08,981
That's what you're thinking.
Just say it.

649
00:31:09,015 --> 00:31:12,780
Well, no, uh,
w-what I was thinking was that

650
00:31:12,796 --> 00:31:14,980
yes, you do set the standards.

651
00:31:14,997 --> 00:31:17,201
You're Wilhelmina Slater,
for pete's sake.

652
00:31:17,216 --> 00:31:19,072
Women look to you
for inspiration,

653
00:31:19,087 --> 00:31:22,653
and when you go to that ball tonight
with that young man of yours,

654
00:31:22,665 --> 00:31:25,950
I guarantee no woman in
America tomorrow morning

655
00:31:25,968 --> 00:31:29,913
will leave her house without a
man ten years younger than her.

656
00:31:29,925 --> 00:31:31,702
Five years.

657
00:31:31,718 --> 00:31:33,670
A year or less.

658
00:31:33,686 --> 00:31:35,732
I don't know.

659
00:31:40,008 --> 00:31:44,123
Are you...
gonna eat that sandwich?

660
00:31:45,027 --> 00:31:47,101
Oh, yeah.

661
00:31:51,005 --> 00:31:53,922
So shall I, uh,
shall I work my magic then?

662
00:31:58,016 --> 00:31:59,652
What's all that?

663
00:31:59,665 --> 00:32:02,423
Just some of the
treasures from my day--

664
00:32:02,437 --> 00:32:05,160
things you left scattered
all over New York City.

665
00:32:05,175 --> 00:32:06,983
Where's the watch?

666
00:32:08,617 --> 00:32:10,443
Good for you.

667
00:32:10,457 --> 00:32:11,791
So which one had it?

668
00:32:11,807 --> 00:32:13,743
Does it matter?

669
00:32:14,247 --> 00:32:16,432
No, not really, I guess.

670
00:32:16,446 --> 00:32:18,242
I didn't think so.

671
00:32:19,238 --> 00:32:21,832
I sent roses to those women.

672
00:32:21,846 --> 00:32:23,613
Amanda sent them, yeah.

673
00:32:23,748 --> 00:32:25,493
And you know, you're right.

674
00:32:25,505 --> 00:32:27,530
You can do whatever you want.

675
00:32:27,545 --> 00:32:31,462
Go from one person to the next.
Flit, flit, flit.

676
00:32:31,478 --> 00:32:34,570
But if you think that no one's
getting hurt, you're wrong.

677
00:32:35,728 --> 00:32:37,050
Is there anything else
you need from me?

678
00:32:37,088 --> 00:32:39,872
No. No. That'll be all.

679
00:32:41,278 --> 00:32:45,372
Betty, you know I've
had a rough week.

680
00:32:45,386 --> 00:32:47,783
I got a lot on my mind.

681
00:32:47,795 --> 00:32:49,611
I know.

682
00:32:49,625 --> 00:32:54,101
I just hope you that you deal with that
more directly than you handled this.

683
00:33:09,547 --> 00:33:13,620
Hail to the queen.
She lives. She breathes.

684
00:33:13,638 --> 00:33:15,503
What do you think
of the décolletage?

685
00:33:15,518 --> 00:33:16,841
Too much cleavage?

686
00:33:16,858 --> 00:33:20,092
I'd say... not enough.

687
00:33:20,108 --> 00:33:23,591
Jason. Hmm,
about time you showed up.

688
00:33:23,605 --> 00:33:26,003
I don't like to be kept waiting.
Ho--hold it.

689
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:28,822
You sure you want to be seen
with an old broad like me?

690
00:33:28,837 --> 00:33:32,743
Well, a minute younger, and I'd have
to rip your clothes off right here.

691
00:33:36,316 --> 00:33:38,812
- Nice brows.
- Oh. Thank you.

692
00:33:40,775 --> 00:33:43,900
Hi. I am so sorry to interrupt you,
but Nico...

693
00:33:43,918 --> 00:33:47,120
Got the messages. Can't return them.
We're late for an engagement.

694
00:33:47,135 --> 00:33:48,963
...is here.

695
00:33:52,907 --> 00:33:54,653
Hi, mom.

696
00:33:54,667 --> 00:33:57,830
Whoa. You're her...

697
00:33:57,848 --> 00:34:00,031
mother?

698
00:34:02,028 --> 00:34:03,412
What can I say?

699
00:34:03,426 --> 00:34:06,213
Rule number one,
never buy your mistress and your wife

700
00:34:06,228 --> 00:34:08,483
the same Christmas present.

701
00:34:08,748 --> 00:34:10,562
I know how you must
feel about me, Daniel,

702
00:34:10,575 --> 00:34:13,792
and I'm truly, truly sorry about Fey.
I am.

703
00:34:13,807 --> 00:34:16,831
I did everything I could to
keep you from getting hurt.

704
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:18,251
And mom?

705
00:34:18,266 --> 00:34:19,642
What about her feelings?

706
00:34:19,656 --> 00:34:22,231
I was careless and stupid,

707
00:34:22,246 --> 00:34:25,970
and Fey wouldn't quit.
She didn't want to be my mistress.

708
00:34:25,987 --> 00:34:27,520
She wanted to be a Meade.

709
00:34:27,537 --> 00:34:29,760
That why you had her killed?

710
00:34:29,828 --> 00:34:32,982
- Is that what you think?
- I don't know, dad.

711
00:34:33,518 --> 00:34:35,802
Why don't you tell me?

712
00:34:37,977 --> 00:34:39,513
Tell you what?

713
00:34:39,527 --> 00:34:41,460
That I loved her?

714
00:34:41,718 --> 00:34:42,980
'Cause I did.

715
00:34:42,997 --> 00:34:44,623
More than mom?

716
00:34:45,477 --> 00:34:47,210
I don't know.

717
00:34:49,167 --> 00:34:51,312
More than all the others,
for sure.

718
00:34:51,327 --> 00:34:54,110
- Others?
- Many, many others.

719
00:34:54,126 --> 00:34:56,602
Who do you think is making
these mysterious phone calls?

720
00:34:56,617 --> 00:34:58,062
Who do you think sent you this?

721
00:34:58,076 --> 00:34:59,652
Are you trying to tell
me it's one of your...

722
00:34:59,687 --> 00:35:02,102
Ex-lovers, yeah.
Out for revenge.

723
00:35:02,115 --> 00:35:04,341
Which one I couldn't say,
but I deserve it.

724
00:35:04,357 --> 00:35:06,540
I deserve much worse.

725
00:35:06,647 --> 00:35:09,681
Not for killing Fey--
that I had nothing to do with--

726
00:35:09,698 --> 00:35:12,982
but for being a lousy husband

727
00:35:12,997 --> 00:35:15,773
and an even lousier father.

728
00:35:16,126 --> 00:35:18,363
If I can't teach
you by my example,

729
00:35:18,378 --> 00:35:20,622
learn from my mistakes.

730
00:35:20,726 --> 00:35:24,382
Stop screwing around.
Settle down, for god's sake.

731
00:35:33,627 --> 00:35:35,820
- Hi.
- Hi.

732
00:35:36,207 --> 00:35:37,923
Down?

733
00:35:44,245 --> 00:35:45,690
- Listen, I'm sorry.
- I was gonna call.

734
00:35:45,725 --> 00:35:48,153
- Sorry.
- No, it, uh, you were saying?

735
00:35:48,168 --> 00:35:51,022
I just--I just wanted
to say thanks.

736
00:35:51,038 --> 00:35:54,950
Thanks? What, for giving you
the most stressful lunch ever?

737
00:35:54,968 --> 00:35:57,011
First I make you eat
slimy sea monsters,

738
00:35:57,025 --> 00:35:58,652
and then I get you in
major trouble with--

739
00:35:58,686 --> 00:36:01,502
It's okay.
That wasn't your fault.

740
00:36:02,545 --> 00:36:05,102
Hey, how's that guy
who ate all that honey?

741
00:36:05,118 --> 00:36:06,572
Not great.

742
00:36:06,588 --> 00:36:08,511
That's why I have to make
the beer run instead of him.

743
00:36:08,547 --> 00:36:11,871
We're having a party up on 25 with
human resources if you're free?

744
00:36:11,886 --> 00:36:16,363
Oh. I'm, uh...
well, I-I'd love to go, Henry, but...

745
00:36:16,377 --> 00:36:18,003
Uh, you have a boyfriend.

746
00:36:18,016 --> 00:36:19,822
Yeah.

747
00:36:19,835 --> 00:36:21,700
Yeah, I do--

748
00:36:21,716 --> 00:36:25,122
and I really want to give this thing
with Walter and me a chance and...

749
00:36:25,138 --> 00:36:27,741
Is that the guy? With the net?

750
00:36:27,755 --> 00:36:29,911
Yeah. Yeah,
but he's not always like that.

751
00:36:29,928 --> 00:36:32,831
I'm not always like that.
I should've never...

752
00:36:33,247 --> 00:36:34,800
I'm sorry.

753
00:36:34,818 --> 00:36:38,662
Ah, no worries. Just lunch.

754
00:36:40,898 --> 00:36:44,592
Trick or treat,
nymphalis milberti.

755
00:36:51,506 --> 00:36:54,241
Hey, you outta here?

756
00:36:54,255 --> 00:36:55,903
I guess.

757
00:36:55,918 --> 00:36:58,800
Human resources and accounting
are having a party downstairs,

758
00:36:58,816 --> 00:37:02,733
so I thought I might stop by
and drink all their booze.

759
00:37:02,748 --> 00:37:04,033
How about you?

760
00:37:04,047 --> 00:37:05,512
Halloween ball?

761
00:37:05,528 --> 00:37:08,543
No. Not, uh, not in the mood.

762
00:37:08,558 --> 00:37:10,531
You have a good time, though.

763
00:37:16,827 --> 00:37:19,080
Hey, um, if you get tired

764
00:37:19,097 --> 00:37:21,692
of watching "Charlie Brown
and the great pumpkin" alone,

765
00:37:21,707 --> 00:37:25,590
I could...
come over and keep you company...

766
00:37:26,588 --> 00:37:29,592
in costume... or not.

767
00:37:29,607 --> 00:37:33,793
I think...
I just need to be alone tonight.

768
00:37:37,648 --> 00:37:40,983
Hey! We could just talk.

769
00:37:42,258 --> 00:37:43,851
Probably not.

770
00:38:00,898 --> 00:38:02,270
Justin.

771
00:38:02,286 --> 00:38:05,582
Justin, stop already.

772
00:38:05,597 --> 00:38:08,660
There is no twirling
in the armed forces.

773
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:12,763
That kid.
We're gonna get no candy this year.

774
00:38:15,657 --> 00:38:18,080
So I guess you
two need to talk.

775
00:38:18,097 --> 00:38:20,981
I don't need to talk.
Maybe she needs to talk.

776
00:38:21,878 --> 00:38:24,810
Okay. Whatever.

777
00:38:31,065 --> 00:38:32,621
Licorice?

778
00:38:32,638 --> 00:38:34,002
Justin hates it.

779
00:38:34,017 --> 00:38:36,021
So does his aunt.

780
00:38:36,246 --> 00:38:38,332
You got any raisins?

781
00:38:38,348 --> 00:38:40,623
Other pocket.

782
00:38:47,558 --> 00:38:50,333
I'm sorry I went to lunch.

783
00:38:50,506 --> 00:38:53,740
The key was... too fast?

784
00:38:53,755 --> 00:38:56,320
Yeah, a little.

785
00:38:56,337 --> 00:38:59,551
I pushed you. Damn it.

786
00:38:59,567 --> 00:39:02,990
"Carpe diem, Virgo.
Seize the day."

787
00:39:03,005 --> 00:39:06,970
Never trust the horoscope
in the "Daily News."

788
00:39:07,207 --> 00:39:10,473
It's just that--well,
we just started dating again, you know?

789
00:39:10,485 --> 00:39:13,700
I know. I know.
And if you don't wanna even do that I--

790
00:39:13,716 --> 00:39:15,630
No, I do.

791
00:39:17,195 --> 00:39:21,082
So you and, uh, sushi man?

792
00:39:21,096 --> 00:39:22,332
Just you.

793
00:39:23,196 --> 00:39:27,580
Because sushi is exciting,
I know.

794
00:39:27,598 --> 00:39:30,990
Even if it is crawling
with parasites.

795
00:39:33,897 --> 00:39:36,053
Sushi's good, yeah.

796
00:39:36,068 --> 00:39:38,662
But so is a nice
slice of pizza.

797
00:39:49,618 --> 00:39:53,430
So my kid shows up.
Last thing I need.

798
00:39:53,447 --> 00:39:55,220
You can do miracles
to hide your own age,

799
00:39:55,238 --> 00:39:57,690
but be damned if
you can hide theirs.

800
00:39:57,705 --> 00:40:01,582
So you didn't take this,
uh, Jason to the party?

801
00:40:01,596 --> 00:40:03,392
No, I took him to the elevator.

802
00:40:03,408 --> 00:40:06,330
Told him to go back to his frat house
and bob for apples.

803
00:40:06,345 --> 00:40:09,233
What about Bradford
and his son?

804
00:40:09,248 --> 00:40:12,643
Well, Marc told me he saw Daniel
coming out of Bradford's office.

805
00:40:12,656 --> 00:40:13,830
All seemed well.

806
00:40:13,846 --> 00:40:16,911
Whatever Bradford said to
Daniel put him off his trail.

807
00:40:16,927 --> 00:40:19,203
That's disappointing.

808
00:40:19,366 --> 00:40:21,060
What do we do now?

809
00:40:21,077 --> 00:40:26,152
I think it's time for Fey Sommers
to come out of seclusion.

810
00:40:31,506 --> 00:40:34,973
I smell fresh blood.

811
00:40:36,635 --> 00:40:40,123
Dad, add more corn syrup.
You're clotting.

812
00:40:41,498 --> 00:40:44,872
You, um...
going out with Walter?

813
00:40:44,887 --> 00:40:48,562
Yeah. I just wanted to come
home first and change.

814
00:40:48,658 --> 00:40:50,511
No more butterfly, huh?

815
00:40:50,525 --> 00:40:52,750
No. You know,
it is exhausting being a butterfly.

816
00:40:52,768 --> 00:40:55,100
No wonder they only
live two weeks.

817
00:40:55,118 --> 00:40:56,392
Is that true?

818
00:40:56,405 --> 00:40:59,411
Mm-hmm. It's just
something I know.

819
00:41:01,196 --> 00:41:03,943
Is there anything
else I should know?

820
00:41:06,985 --> 00:41:08,902
Right. Of course.

821
00:41:10,765 --> 00:41:13,662
I was trying to protect you.

822
00:41:14,347 --> 00:41:19,312
I've been using someone else's
social security number for years.

823
00:41:19,475 --> 00:41:21,732
'Cause I don't have one.

824
00:41:24,247 --> 00:41:26,531
You can't get one

825
00:41:26,547 --> 00:41:29,602
if you're in this
country illegally.

826
00:41:31,376 --> 00:41:33,641
And I am.

827
00:41:37,638 --> 00:41:39,513
Trick or treat.

828
00:41:39,868 --> 00:41:43,931
