1
00:01:01,128 --> 00:01:04,430
Santiago de Chile, 1973.

2
00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:07,433
Political riots have
been destabilizing

3
00:01:07,435 --> 00:01:09,301
the entire country.

4
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:13,839
Chile has become the
latest battleground of the

5
00:01:13,841 --> 00:01:16,742
cold war with the united
states turning its back on

6
00:01:16,744 --> 00:01:18,410
the young democracy.

7
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:22,781
Meanwhile, the Soviet union
guarantees its support.

8
00:01:30,858 --> 00:01:33,826
The us government Salvador
allende is nothing but a

9
00:01:33,828 --> 00:01:37,596
communist who needs to be
kicked out from office.

10
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:46,138
Hundreds of thousands of people
are taking to the streets

11
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,674
of Santiago de Chile in
support of president

12
00:01:48,676 --> 00:01:50,809
Salvador allende.

13
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:58,750
Experts see Chile at the
verge of a civil war.

14
00:02:01,654 --> 00:02:04,356
The world is holding its
breath as we wait for the

15
00:02:04,358 --> 00:02:06,458
latest developments
in Chile.

16
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:32,885
Ladies and gentlemen, we have
begun our initial descent

17
00:02:32,887 --> 00:02:34,920
into Santiago de Chile.

18
00:02:34,922 --> 00:02:37,856
Please fasten your seat
belts, fold away your tray

19
00:02:37,858 --> 00:02:41,627
tables and bring your seats
into an upright position.

20
00:02:41,629 --> 00:02:43,262
We'll be landing shortly.

21
00:02:43,264 --> 00:02:45,197
Thank you.

22
00:02:50,603 --> 00:02:53,672
Comrades, why are we here?

23
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:55,941
Burning under the sun?

24
00:02:55,943 --> 00:02:57,743
Ask yourselves!

25
00:02:57,745 --> 00:03:02,881
We are here, so the working
class can have more power!

26
00:03:02,883 --> 00:03:07,519
I know we are all
suffering, but we must

27
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:10,756
fight for our
president allende!

28
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:20,799
Off! Off! Off!
Off! Off! Off!

29
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:22,768
-Off! Off! Off!
-Easy, ladies!

30
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:25,304
You all know
the magic words.

31
00:03:25,306 --> 00:03:30,943
Okay, rapunzel, rapunzel,
let down your golden hair.

32
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:38,450
Oh my god!

33
00:03:38,452 --> 00:03:39,484
What's going on?

34
00:03:39,486 --> 00:03:41,253
Just get out of the way!

35
00:03:41,255 --> 00:03:42,521
Why are they protesting?

36
00:03:42,523 --> 00:03:44,423
Ah, inflation,
food shortages.

37
00:03:44,425 --> 00:03:46,458
It is getting
very bad now.

38
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,627
Oh boy, I should have
taken the Miami route.

39
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:54,833
That's him!

40
00:03:57,638 --> 00:03:59,605
Wait! I'm getting off.

41
00:03:59,607 --> 00:04:00,973
We must defend...

42
00:04:00,975 --> 00:04:01,907
Are you crazy?

43
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:03,542
See you in four days!

44
00:04:03,544 --> 00:04:04,710
Make him work for it.

45
00:04:04,712 --> 00:04:09,848
Let us be seen as one
Chilean with dignity.

46
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:15,520
As a Chilean who stands side
by side with the poorest.

47
00:04:15,522 --> 00:04:18,523
Here I am with the rest
of you, my colleagues.

48
00:04:18,525 --> 00:04:22,594
Because I want to
defend what is ours.

49
00:04:25,498 --> 00:04:29,768
And now, we'll be here
till the end if necessary.

50
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:32,771
I am here my friends.

51
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:35,941
Because I've got the conscience
of a working class men.

52
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:37,576
Hi.

53
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:48,553
Our right to build a future.

54
00:04:48,555 --> 00:04:51,757
A future for
justice and Liberty.

55
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,558
Why didn't you tell
me you were coming?

56
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,027
I wanted to surprise you.

57
00:04:55,029 --> 00:04:56,328
You're crazy.

58
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:06,738
Welcome.

59
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:11,610
Daniel.

60
00:05:11,612 --> 00:05:17,015
If you want to hide anything
or put anything aside...

61
00:05:17,017 --> 00:05:21,086
Like, um, from
another girl or...

62
00:05:21,088 --> 00:05:22,888
Maybe.

63
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,391
Because if I find a harem
of hot Chilean girls

64
00:05:26,393 --> 00:05:30,696
stashed in your apartment,
I'm gonna cut your balls off.

65
00:05:42,609 --> 00:05:43,442
You've been busy.

66
00:05:43,444 --> 00:05:44,710
Mhm.

67
00:05:44,712 --> 00:05:46,345
I didn't come to
Chile for nothing.

68
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:06,465
You've passed the
home inspection.

69
00:06:06,467 --> 00:06:09,434
But I still need
to search you.

70
00:06:09,436 --> 00:06:11,370
You have a warrant?

71
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,406
Do I need one?

72
00:06:27,855 --> 00:06:30,389
The us wants
to see us fail.

73
00:06:34,762 --> 00:06:38,830
They want to topple allende,
to take control over Chile

74
00:06:38,832 --> 00:06:40,632
and our lives!

75
00:06:40,634 --> 00:06:44,569
We will stand our
ground and fight back!

76
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:47,839
Viva Chile!

77
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:53,812
He's great. Very good.

78
00:06:53,814 --> 00:06:55,814
Daniel has designed a
new poster for us

79
00:06:55,816 --> 00:06:57,115
to spread our message.

80
00:06:57,117 --> 00:06:58,617
Daniel, come. Come.

81
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:08,927
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no.

82
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:10,529
You have to speak.

83
00:07:10,531 --> 00:07:11,129
You have to speak
to the people.

84
00:07:11,131 --> 00:07:12,197
-No.
-Yes, come on.

85
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:13,465
-No.
-Hey.

86
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:16,201
Speak!

87
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:22,174
I came to Chile at around
four months ago...

88
00:07:22,176 --> 00:07:24,943
And it has become
my country.

89
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:27,646
But what we need in this
country is solidarity.

90
00:07:27,648 --> 00:07:29,848
The suffering of the many
must never again be the

91
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:32,551
foundation for the
wealth of the few.

92
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:38,557
Chile!

93
00:07:42,528 --> 00:07:46,565
Chile!

94
00:08:15,561 --> 00:08:17,095
Good morning.

95
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:23,001
President allende called.

96
00:08:25,137 --> 00:08:27,138
I told him
you were sleeping.

97
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,069
Hey!

98
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:06,611
Hey.

99
00:09:06,613 --> 00:09:07,546
Give me the camera.

100
00:09:07,548 --> 00:09:08,847
Camera's mine now.

101
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:30,969
Ah! It was all a ruse
to get the camera!

102
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,123
You have a great eye.

103
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:52,123
What?

104
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:56,294
I think your pictures
have got so much better.

105
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:07,772
These are my favorites.

106
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:10,942
Look at this one.

107
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:12,377
So powerful.

108
00:10:12,379 --> 00:10:13,945
You've got quite
an eye yourself.

109
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:16,114
This is so powerful.

110
00:10:18,352 --> 00:10:22,787
The modern man: Sexy and
practical at the same time.

111
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:08,233
Hey.

112
00:11:08,235 --> 00:11:09,701
Hm.

113
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:16,775
I can't believe it...

114
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:21,212
You have to go
back in two days.

115
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:25,717
Don't think
about that now.

116
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,022
Why can't you
just stay here?

117
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:33,058
With me?

118
00:11:36,762 --> 00:11:41,266
Keep the house clean,
do the laundry.

119
00:11:41,268 --> 00:11:43,368
Have your slippers waiting
for you by the fire,

120
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,470
your dinner ready.

121
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:52,243
I can't stay here.

122
00:11:52,245 --> 00:11:55,213
But maybe it's time
that you came back.

123
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:59,484
Yeah.

124
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:07,225
Phone's ringing.

125
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:08,760
Yeah.

126
00:12:08,762 --> 00:12:10,228
Leave it.

127
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,963
It's my mother.

128
00:12:11,965 --> 00:12:13,098
How do you know?

129
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,033
The disappointed ring.

130
00:12:16,268 --> 00:12:18,136
Today is my
father's birthday.

131
00:12:18,138 --> 00:12:20,305
She wants me
to talk to him.

132
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:22,774
And you won't, I guess?

133
00:12:22,776 --> 00:12:24,809
I'm done with him.

134
00:12:26,445 --> 00:12:28,980
Daniel...

135
00:12:28,982 --> 00:12:31,116
Take it.

136
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:46,030
Hello?

137
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,434
What?

138
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:51,970
Oh, shit!

139
00:12:51,972 --> 00:12:54,005
Yeah.

140
00:12:54,007 --> 00:12:55,273
Thanks, yeah.

141
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:57,108
We got to go.

142
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,443
Pinochet has taken over.

143
00:12:58,445 --> 00:12:59,878
There's been a
military coup.

144
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,312
They are arresting
allende supporters.

145
00:13:01,314 --> 00:13:03,348
They confiscated my
posters at the university.

146
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:05,116
They'll be here soon.
We have to go!

147
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:06,184
Where're we gonna go?

148
00:13:06,186 --> 00:13:07,018
I don't know.

149
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,453
Just out!

150
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:35,113
What are you doing?

151
00:13:36,249 --> 00:13:38,249
Stop it!

152
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:12,617
What are you doing?

153
00:14:12,619 --> 00:14:14,052
-Stop it!
-Hey!

154
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,573
Stop!

155
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:37,242
Stop!

156
00:15:15,347 --> 00:15:17,949
Attention!

157
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:22,353
Law and order are being
reestablished in Chile.

158
00:15:22,355 --> 00:15:25,290
Be assured that everybody
who is here by mistake

159
00:15:25,292 --> 00:15:28,159
will soon be released.

160
00:15:28,161 --> 00:15:34,098
Soldiers have orders to shoot
anybody who moves or talks.

161
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:51,169
No, no!

162
00:17:51,171 --> 00:17:52,370
Hey, hey!

163
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:42,740
They shoved him in a Van
and they drove him away.

164
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:45,276
A white bus, with a
red cross in a circle.

165
00:20:45,278 --> 00:20:46,911
Like an ambulance.

166
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:49,547
We know that bus.

167
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,351
So you know where he is?

168
00:20:54,653 --> 00:20:56,454
It's a place in the south.

169
00:20:56,456 --> 00:20:58,456
Completely cut off from
the outside world.

170
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:01,425
Pinochet's police
take prisoners there.

171
00:21:02,494 --> 00:21:04,262
What's it called?

172
00:21:04,264 --> 00:21:06,430
Colonia dignidad.

173
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:08,733
The colony of dignity.

174
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:11,002
Well we need
to get him out.

175
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:17,675
Look, this is not about
Daniel or me or him or her.

176
00:21:17,677 --> 00:21:19,977
It's a bigger cause
we are fighting for.

177
00:21:22,014 --> 00:21:24,348
What do you mean?

178
00:21:27,052 --> 00:21:29,854
We can't do
anything for Daniel.

179
00:21:29,856 --> 00:21:31,722
But he's one of you!

180
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:37,461
We are going into hiding.

181
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:39,730
And Daniel?

182
00:21:39,732 --> 00:21:42,300
I wish him luck.

183
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:10,428
He's yours.

184
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:11,796
Thank you.

185
00:22:23,942 --> 00:22:25,576
You can go.

186
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:32,650
It's all right.

187
00:22:33,585 --> 00:22:35,619
It's all right.

188
00:22:35,621 --> 00:22:37,521
I'm here now.

189
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:39,790
It's okay.

190
00:22:39,792 --> 00:22:41,726
You're safe.

191
00:22:44,763 --> 00:22:47,131
There's no danger anymore.

192
00:22:47,133 --> 00:22:49,133
Just relax.

193
00:22:56,742 --> 00:22:59,610
I'm sure you are
mistaken, miss kortus.

194
00:22:59,612 --> 00:23:02,413
The colonia dignidad is
a long established and

195
00:23:02,415 --> 00:23:05,049
completely respectable
enterprise.

196
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:08,486
With full government
approval.

197
00:23:08,488 --> 00:23:12,022
We here at amnesty international
have no further information.

198
00:23:12,024 --> 00:23:14,792
If I were you, I'd stay in
touch with your embassy.

199
00:23:14,794 --> 00:23:16,460
But I've--

200
00:23:19,765 --> 00:23:21,165
thank you.

201
00:23:21,167 --> 00:23:23,834
Thank you, miss
kortus and goodbye.

202
00:23:25,437 --> 00:23:26,637
Goodbye.

203
00:23:33,012 --> 00:23:33,978
I'm being bugged.

204
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,679
Now we can talk.

205
00:23:45,557 --> 00:23:47,725
I'm not getting it.

206
00:23:47,727 --> 00:23:49,527
What is this place?

207
00:23:49,529 --> 00:23:51,829
Allegedly, a
charitable mission.

208
00:23:51,831 --> 00:23:55,466
But really it's a kind of
cult, run by a man called

209
00:23:55,468 --> 00:23:59,537
Paul Schafer, or pius
as they call him.

210
00:23:59,539 --> 00:24:01,872
He was a lay preacher in
Germany after the war,

211
00:24:01,874 --> 00:24:04,608
came here with his
disciples to set up a

212
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:07,912
world according to his rules
in the middle of nowhere.

213
00:24:07,914 --> 00:24:09,847
What kind of rules?

214
00:24:09,849 --> 00:24:11,549
No one really knows.

215
00:24:12,217 --> 00:24:14,585
What if I went there?

216
00:24:14,587 --> 00:24:16,086
Joined up.

217
00:24:16,088 --> 00:24:17,154
I wouldn't do that.

218
00:24:17,156 --> 00:24:18,589
Why not?

219
00:24:19,925 --> 00:24:22,893
You may never
get back out.

220
00:24:22,895 --> 00:24:24,628
But I could get in?

221
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:28,999
Probably.

222
00:24:40,612 --> 00:24:43,681
Dear Roman, you must be
standing in the lobby now,

223
00:24:43,683 --> 00:24:48,752
ready to leave for the airport,
but I won't be coming.

224
00:24:48,754 --> 00:24:50,120
I'm sorry.

225
00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:54,925
Crazy things are happening
here, and sometimes you

226
00:24:54,927 --> 00:24:56,861
have to break the rules.

227
00:24:56,863 --> 00:24:59,630
Isn't that what
you told me?

228
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:04,001
Can you cover for
me, please Roman?

229
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:06,003
I'll be on next
week's flight.

230
00:25:06,771 --> 00:25:08,572
And wish me luck.

231
00:25:08,574 --> 00:25:11,609
Love, Lena.

232
00:25:11,611 --> 00:25:13,944
Is everything okay?

233
00:25:13,946 --> 00:25:15,212
Lena's not coming.

234
00:25:15,214 --> 00:25:15,212
She's ill.

235
00:25:15,214 --> 00:25:18,048
She'll be on the
flight next week.

236
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:20,084
Let's go.

237
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:45,009
Cross the field and
walk toward the mountain.

238
00:25:45,011 --> 00:25:46,010
You can't miss it.

239
00:25:46,012 --> 00:25:47,244
Thank you.

240
00:27:01,386 --> 00:27:04,121
God bless.

241
00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:05,389
God bless.

242
00:27:10,362 --> 00:27:11,929
Come.

243
00:27:26,378 --> 00:27:27,277
God bless.

244
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:29,079
God bless.

245
00:27:43,428 --> 00:27:45,062
You wish to join us?

246
00:27:45,064 --> 00:27:46,296
Yes, ma'am.

247
00:27:46,298 --> 00:27:48,065
I want to follow
the way of the lord.

248
00:27:48,067 --> 00:27:50,167
Don't babble.

249
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:52,436
The lord doesn't
like idle talk.

250
00:27:52,438 --> 00:27:54,405
A simple yes will suffice.

251
00:28:01,413 --> 00:28:02,413
Meal time.

252
00:28:02,415 --> 00:28:04,214
Come.

253
00:28:12,157 --> 00:28:13,257
Um...

254
00:28:13,259 --> 00:28:15,893
You won't need
any of this.

255
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,800
Are you all right?

256
00:28:58,404 --> 00:28:59,903
Leave the boy alone.

257
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:01,071
But he's crying.

258
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,842
It's none of
your business.

259
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:10,848
God bless.

260
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:10,848
God bless.

261
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:15,219
Come, pull yourself together
and stop crying now.

262
00:29:18,022 --> 00:29:19,456
Your turn.

263
00:29:21,793 --> 00:29:23,260
Your turn.

264
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:25,496
For what?

265
00:29:25,498 --> 00:29:28,232
General confession
with pius.

266
00:30:00,832 --> 00:30:02,199
Come in.

267
00:30:13,578 --> 00:30:15,846
What's your name?

268
00:30:15,848 --> 00:30:17,314
Lena.

269
00:30:18,249 --> 00:30:24,822
So how have you spent
your life so far, Lena?

270
00:30:24,824 --> 00:30:27,991
I've been searching for god,
but I haven't found him yet.

271
00:30:27,993 --> 00:30:29,927
Ah.

272
00:30:29,929 --> 00:30:32,029
You see, even though
he's everywhere,

273
00:30:32,031 --> 00:30:34,431
he's so hard to find.

274
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:44,208
Do you know who I am?

275
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:45,542
Who am I?

276
00:30:47,045 --> 00:30:48,912
You're pius.

277
00:30:48,914 --> 00:30:51,849
The good Shepherd, who
leads his flock to the

278
00:30:51,851 --> 00:30:54,218
lord's heavenly kingdom.

279
00:30:55,421 --> 00:30:57,254
Yeah.

280
00:30:58,256 --> 00:31:03,527
Ours is a poor and humble
life, full of hard work.

281
00:31:03,529 --> 00:31:08,966
Once you join us,
you must remain.

282
00:31:08,968 --> 00:31:10,601
Yes.

283
00:31:14,505 --> 00:31:16,506
You're an
attractive woman.

284
00:31:16,508 --> 00:31:18,475
You must have a boyfriend.

285
00:31:18,477 --> 00:31:20,878
Someone who loves you.

286
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,346
No.

287
00:31:22,348 --> 00:31:24,181
I want to follow
the way of the lord.

288
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:31,521
You're not
telling the truth.

289
00:31:31,523 --> 00:31:34,491
I can see it in your eyes.

290
00:31:34,493 --> 00:31:36,627
I see it in your soul.

291
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:40,230
Is Satan inside you?

292
00:31:40,232 --> 00:31:41,164
No.

293
00:31:41,166 --> 00:31:43,166
Take off you apron.

294
00:31:44,168 --> 00:31:48,138
Take off you apron.

295
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:03,453
Open your blouse.

296
00:32:05,556 --> 00:32:09,092
Open your blouse.

297
00:32:20,505 --> 00:32:23,507
Just what I thought.

298
00:32:23,509 --> 00:32:26,410
Gray rags on the outside,
the instruments of the

299
00:32:26,412 --> 00:32:28,545
harlot beneath.

300
00:32:36,554 --> 00:32:39,222
I smell the beast of hell.

301
00:32:39,224 --> 00:32:40,290
Did you touch yourself?

302
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:41,992
No.

303
00:32:41,994 --> 00:32:42,960
Is Satan inside you?

304
00:32:42,962 --> 00:32:44,227
No.

305
00:32:44,229 --> 00:32:47,097
Do you renounce Satan,
the beast of hell?

306
00:32:47,099 --> 00:32:47,097
Yes.

307
00:32:47,099 --> 00:32:49,733
Do you renounce the
sins of the flesh?

308
00:32:49,735 --> 00:32:49,733
Yes.

309
00:32:49,735 --> 00:32:53,737
Do you renounce all
lies and deceit?

310
00:32:53,739 --> 00:32:54,604
Yes!

311
00:32:56,674 --> 00:32:59,409
Tell me the truth.

312
00:32:59,411 --> 00:33:01,712
Why are you here?

313
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:06,583
I'm here for you pius.

314
00:33:07,685 --> 00:33:10,320
I need you, that's why.

315
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:14,758
Oh, now you've
spoken truly.

316
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:19,396
Feel the grace of the
lord coming down on you.

317
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:27,104
Men, women and children
live separately.

318
00:33:27,106 --> 00:33:30,107
It's best for
everybody that way.

319
00:33:30,109 --> 00:33:32,709
And separate
means separate.

320
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:42,652
Lena.

321
00:33:54,332 --> 00:33:55,665
Come.

322
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:04,508
Your bed is back there.

323
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:10,313
Everything you need
is in the basket.

324
00:34:10,315 --> 00:34:12,716
Use the bandage to tie
down your breasts.

325
00:34:12,718 --> 00:34:14,217
And take off those shoes.

326
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:16,186
You look like a slut.

327
00:34:59,397 --> 00:35:00,464
This is Lena.

328
00:35:00,466 --> 00:35:02,265
She is one of you now.

329
00:35:03,534 --> 00:35:05,769
Hello.

330
00:35:39,504 --> 00:35:41,271
God bless.

331
00:35:41,273 --> 00:35:42,806
Hello.

332
00:35:43,741 --> 00:35:46,143
Are you from the outside?

333
00:35:46,145 --> 00:35:49,312
Yes, I'm from the outside.

334
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,248
She's from the outside!

335
00:35:53,485 --> 00:35:55,285
That's funny.

336
00:35:57,522 --> 00:35:59,623
Can I tell you a secret?

337
00:36:00,591 --> 00:36:02,759
I may be getting
married soon.

338
00:36:02,761 --> 00:36:02,759
Really?

339
00:36:02,761 --> 00:36:05,829
I thought men and women
here were separated.

340
00:36:05,831 --> 00:36:06,763
They are.

341
00:36:06,765 --> 00:36:08,665
But sometimes...

342
00:36:10,569 --> 00:36:12,169
Get in line.

343
00:36:36,794 --> 00:36:37,928
-Swallow.
-What for? I--

344
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:39,496
swallow!

345
00:36:46,938 --> 00:36:48,471
Open.

346
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:06,356
Work means serving god.

347
00:37:06,358 --> 00:37:09,759
And if you carry the lord
in your heart, your hands

348
00:37:09,761 --> 00:37:12,963
will do the lord's work.

349
00:37:28,879 --> 00:37:30,313
My god.

350
00:37:30,315 --> 00:37:32,282
What did you do to him?

351
00:37:32,284 --> 00:37:35,385
We just asked him a
couple of questions.

352
00:37:35,387 --> 00:37:38,521
I don't know if he'll ever
become a human being again.

353
00:37:38,523 --> 00:37:40,257
He could still be useful.

354
00:37:40,259 --> 00:37:42,325
But if the electric shocks
damaged the cortex, nobody

355
00:37:42,327 --> 00:37:43,793
knows what he's
gonna be like.

356
00:37:43,795 --> 00:37:46,696
Everything under god's sun
is good for something.

357
00:37:46,698 --> 00:37:48,465
Got it?

358
00:37:48,467 --> 00:37:51,768
You know, if your people
treat prisoners as badly

359
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:54,004
as this one,
that's no good.

360
00:37:54,006 --> 00:37:56,640
Worst case, he'll shit
all over himself and die

361
00:37:56,642 --> 00:37:58,775
without revealing
anything.

362
00:37:58,777 --> 00:38:00,410
I see exactly
what you mean.

363
00:38:00,412 --> 00:38:02,912
That's where psychology
comes into play.

364
00:38:02,914 --> 00:38:02,912
Anyone can torture,

365
00:38:02,914 --> 00:38:07,584
but to break a person
without harming physically,

366
00:38:07,586 --> 00:38:09,486
that's an art.

367
00:38:19,563 --> 00:38:22,866
Doro, quicker.

368
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:28,805
And the rest of you.

369
00:38:59,037 --> 00:39:03,640
Is that how you serve
the lord you lazy slut?

370
00:39:03,642 --> 00:39:04,708
No, no, please!

371
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:06,609
I just need to
drink something.

372
00:39:06,611 --> 00:39:08,044
Is that so?

373
00:39:08,046 --> 00:39:11,648
Okay, I'll take
care of that.

374
00:39:23,994 --> 00:39:25,428
Thank you.

375
00:39:26,063 --> 00:39:27,464
Stop!

376
00:39:28,065 --> 00:39:30,700
You think I'm
waiting on you?

377
00:39:30,702 --> 00:39:32,836
If even one drop is
missing by this evening,

378
00:39:32,838 --> 00:39:34,671
I'll make you regret it.

379
00:39:34,673 --> 00:39:38,475
And keep that bucket next
to you at all times.

380
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:41,644
What are you
cows staring at?

381
00:39:56,861 --> 00:39:58,561
What are you doing here?

382
00:40:00,799 --> 00:40:02,432
Nothing.

383
00:40:03,534 --> 00:40:04,801
Out.

384
00:40:04,803 --> 00:40:06,636
Come on, let's go.

385
00:40:40,838 --> 00:40:43,907
Today's schedule has
been changed.

386
00:40:43,909 --> 00:40:48,511
All women are to come to the
women's hall immediately.

387
00:40:48,513 --> 00:40:52,482
You heard, everyone to
the women's hall now.

388
00:40:52,484 --> 00:40:54,117
Move it!

389
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:02,058
Doro.

390
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:03,193
Shhh.

391
00:41:03,195 --> 00:41:05,562
Please, just one thing.

392
00:41:06,497 --> 00:41:08,731
How did you and
your fiance meet?

393
00:41:08,733 --> 00:41:09,766
You mean dieter?

394
00:41:09,768 --> 00:41:11,067
Yes.

395
00:41:11,069 --> 00:41:13,136
Mixed parade.

396
00:41:13,138 --> 00:41:15,038
What is that?

397
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:17,073
When there's
important guests,

398
00:41:17,075 --> 00:41:20,009
we sing and get to
wear our Sunday best.

399
00:41:20,011 --> 00:41:22,679
And suddenly,
there was dieter.

400
00:41:22,681 --> 00:41:24,681
When was that?

401
00:41:24,683 --> 00:41:27,016
Two... no, three.

402
00:41:27,018 --> 00:41:28,017
Three years ago.

403
00:41:28,019 --> 00:41:29,686
Three years ago?

404
00:41:29,688 --> 00:41:31,120
And since then?

405
00:41:31,122 --> 00:41:32,722
We are in love.

406
00:41:32,724 --> 00:41:35,592
Yes, but when do
you see each other?

407
00:41:35,594 --> 00:41:38,695
We don't.

408
00:41:38,697 --> 00:41:40,897
You haven't seen
him for three years?

409
00:41:40,899 --> 00:41:41,965
Couldn't.

410
00:41:41,967 --> 00:41:43,800
No mixed parades.

411
00:41:46,136 --> 00:41:51,508
You can't see because
you're eyes are blind.

412
00:41:52,911 --> 00:41:57,847
And you can't feel,
because your hearts

413
00:41:57,849 --> 00:42:00,083
are made of stone.

414
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:05,722
But I, I, I can see,
i can feel.

415
00:42:05,724 --> 00:42:06,856
Yes.

416
00:42:06,858 --> 00:42:09,626
Because it's god
looking through me.

417
00:42:09,628 --> 00:42:11,060
Yes!

418
00:42:11,062 --> 00:42:12,996
It's god talking
through me!

419
00:42:12,998 --> 00:42:14,998
Yes!

420
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:19,135
I'm calling you, Alfred.

421
00:42:19,137 --> 00:42:20,870
Come out of your coffin.

422
00:42:20,872 --> 00:42:22,071
Get up and live.

423
00:42:22,073 --> 00:42:24,207
Come and rise.

424
00:42:24,209 --> 00:42:31,114
Rise from death to celebrate
the lord almighty.

425
00:42:31,116 --> 00:42:32,549
Yes!

426
00:42:32,551 --> 00:42:33,149
Lord almighty!

427
00:42:37,121 --> 00:42:38,288
Because you shall live.

428
00:42:38,290 --> 00:42:39,689
Yes, live!

429
00:42:39,691 --> 00:42:41,724
-You shall live.
-Alfred, live!

430
00:42:44,194 --> 00:42:45,895
Yes.

431
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:48,264
I am the resurrection
and the life.

432
00:42:48,266 --> 00:42:48,264
Yes.

433
00:42:48,266 --> 00:42:51,568
And I'm telling
you, Alfred.

434
00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:56,239
Who believes shall see
the glory of the lord.

435
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:02,312
I'm telling you to
overcome death.

436
00:43:02,314 --> 00:43:03,313
And rise!

437
00:43:03,315 --> 00:43:04,747
Rise!

438
00:43:04,749 --> 00:43:06,249
Rise!

439
00:43:11,855 --> 00:43:13,690
Pius.

440
00:43:13,692 --> 00:43:16,960
We all saw it and
we all heard it.

441
00:43:16,962 --> 00:43:18,928
When you called Alfred...

442
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:22,332
It wasn't your voice,
it was god's voice!

443
00:43:24,603 --> 00:43:27,370
But the miracle couldn't
take place, because

444
00:43:27,372 --> 00:43:30,006
there's too much sin
in our community.

445
00:43:31,676 --> 00:43:33,076
Too much sin!

446
00:43:54,999 --> 00:43:56,199
You stay here.

447
00:43:58,369 --> 00:43:58,368
Who's that?

448
00:43:58,370 --> 00:44:01,371
That's hans. He's
one of us now.

449
00:44:01,373 --> 00:44:02,939
Hans?

450
00:44:02,941 --> 00:44:05,141
I... I'm hans.

451
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:08,111
He's as dumb as they come,
but pius wants you to keep

452
00:44:08,113 --> 00:44:08,111
an eye on him.

453
00:44:08,113 --> 00:44:10,647
What am I going
to do with him?

454
00:44:10,649 --> 00:44:12,348
Just give him an easy job.

455
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:14,751
Can you handle that?

456
00:44:25,796 --> 00:44:28,931
Ga... ga...
Good to meet you.

457
00:44:57,061 --> 00:44:59,162
How's it going, hans?

458
00:44:59,164 --> 00:45:01,230
Fine.

459
00:45:21,985 --> 00:45:23,186
Lena?

460
00:45:24,188 --> 00:45:25,955
Come here a minute.

461
00:45:28,492 --> 00:45:32,261
I know it's awfully
difficult at the beginning.

462
00:45:32,263 --> 00:45:37,100
Everyone struggles at first,
but it's just a test.

463
00:45:37,102 --> 00:45:39,268
And you're doing very
well, I must say.

464
00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:40,937
Honestly.

465
00:45:40,939 --> 00:45:43,039
Thank you, aunt gisela.

466
00:45:46,276 --> 00:45:50,346
I like you, Lena, and the
others like you, too.

467
00:45:50,348 --> 00:45:52,148
I don't know.

468
00:45:52,150 --> 00:45:53,816
Yeah, they do.

469
00:45:53,818 --> 00:45:55,952
I can tell.

470
00:45:55,954 --> 00:45:57,987
Especially doro.

471
00:45:57,989 --> 00:46:00,089
She just loves you.

472
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:02,925
And now she's
getting married.

473
00:46:03,895 --> 00:46:05,261
She said so.

474
00:46:05,263 --> 00:46:07,029
I'm so happy for her.

475
00:46:07,464 --> 00:46:09,832
She must have told
you about her fiance?

476
00:46:09,834 --> 00:46:12,835
Not really, just that...

477
00:46:12,837 --> 00:46:17,106
They're in love and
his name's dieter.

478
00:46:17,108 --> 00:46:20,409
Yeah, dieter.

479
00:46:20,411 --> 00:46:22,278
Doro and dieter.

480
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:24,547
What a perfect match.

481
00:46:25,149 --> 00:46:28,217
Get back to work now.

482
00:47:13,297 --> 00:47:14,931
Hans?

483
00:47:15,866 --> 00:47:18,301
Where is that
bloody moron?

484
00:47:18,869 --> 00:47:20,069
Hans!

485
00:47:21,071 --> 00:47:22,872
What the fuck
are you doing?

486
00:47:22,874 --> 00:47:23,539
Nothing.

487
00:47:23,541 --> 00:47:25,908
I, I, I need to pee.

488
00:47:27,045 --> 00:47:28,110
Did, did
you pee in here?

489
00:47:28,112 --> 00:47:29,512
No.

490
00:47:29,514 --> 00:47:31,347
Did you piss into any
of these containers?

491
00:47:31,349 --> 00:47:32,114
Uh, no.

492
00:47:32,116 --> 00:47:34,283
Take a piss outside.

493
00:47:35,285 --> 00:47:36,986
Damn it.

494
00:47:44,061 --> 00:47:45,628
Dorothea, come along.

495
00:47:45,630 --> 00:47:47,330
Everyone else,
go back to sleep.

496
00:47:47,332 --> 00:47:50,399
No, no, no, no...

497
00:47:50,401 --> 00:47:51,968
No, no, no!

498
00:47:51,970 --> 00:47:53,369
I said back to sleep.

499
00:47:53,904 --> 00:47:56,606
Dorothea, don't
make it worse.

500
00:47:56,608 --> 00:47:58,875
Don't make it worse!

501
00:47:58,877 --> 00:48:00,142
Oh.

502
00:48:00,477 --> 00:48:01,377
Come!

503
00:48:01,379 --> 00:48:02,879
No! Please, don't.

504
00:48:02,881 --> 00:48:04,280
No!

505
00:49:11,682 --> 00:49:13,149
Go.

506
00:49:18,555 --> 00:49:19,522
It still stinks.

507
00:49:24,328 --> 00:49:27,296
Not even this divine music
can drive the devil out.

508
00:49:27,298 --> 00:49:28,731
No.

509
00:49:28,733 --> 00:49:31,067
I still smell the harlot.

510
00:49:31,069 --> 00:49:32,702
Rotten to the core.

511
00:49:32,704 --> 00:49:34,303
Yes.

512
00:49:34,305 --> 00:49:36,339
But it's not your
fault, woman.

513
00:49:36,341 --> 00:49:38,607
That you have Satan
inside of you.

514
00:49:42,746 --> 00:49:44,580
So you want to marry, eh?

515
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:52,121
Who would want
to marry you?

516
00:49:52,123 --> 00:49:53,756
You ugly, stinking cunt?

517
00:49:56,060 --> 00:49:58,461
I can't hear you.
Speak up, woman!

518
00:50:00,531 --> 00:50:02,231
I know who.

519
00:50:06,203 --> 00:50:08,170
Dieter, right?

520
00:50:11,309 --> 00:50:13,342
Dieter.

521
00:50:15,278 --> 00:50:17,313
Dieter, dieter, dieter.

522
00:50:17,781 --> 00:50:23,586
What do you say to the proposal
from this ugly, stinking cow?

523
00:50:27,157 --> 00:50:28,758
Well?

524
00:50:31,194 --> 00:50:32,461
It stinks.

525
00:50:34,032 --> 00:50:35,131
That's right.

526
00:50:35,133 --> 00:50:37,500
That's right,
dieter, it stinks.

527
00:50:38,301 --> 00:50:40,269
Why don't you come up here
and relieve your lover of

528
00:50:40,271 --> 00:50:42,138
her stench?

529
00:50:43,608 --> 00:50:47,143
Those are the demons
in her that you smell.

530
00:50:47,577 --> 00:50:49,278
That we must drive out.

531
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:50,746
Yes!

532
00:50:50,748 --> 00:50:52,181
So we can breathe again!

533
00:50:52,183 --> 00:50:53,282
Yes!

534
00:50:53,284 --> 00:50:54,350
We must drive it out!

535
00:50:54,352 --> 00:50:55,484
Yes!

536
00:50:55,486 --> 00:50:57,486
So we are gonna
breathe again.

537
00:50:57,488 --> 00:50:59,588
No, please!

538
00:51:01,591 --> 00:51:03,359
Are you just going to
stand there like a fool?

539
00:51:03,361 --> 00:51:04,226
That doesn't help her.

540
00:51:04,228 --> 00:51:05,728
Come on.

541
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:07,730
What we do we do
with the love.

542
00:51:07,732 --> 00:51:09,265
Yes.

543
00:51:09,267 --> 00:51:10,332
What we do we do
with the love!

544
00:51:10,334 --> 00:51:12,501
Yes!

545
00:51:17,207 --> 00:51:19,075
- Yeah!

546
00:51:20,177 --> 00:51:21,677
- Yeah!

547
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:24,380
- Yeah!

548
00:51:25,082 --> 00:51:26,782
- Yeah!

549
00:51:30,088 --> 00:51:32,254
Dieter, dieter, dieter.

550
00:51:32,256 --> 00:51:33,656
The whore has enslaved you.

551
00:51:33,658 --> 00:51:35,224
Yeah!

552
00:51:35,226 --> 00:51:36,492
That's the work
of the devil!

553
00:51:36,494 --> 00:51:37,760
Yes!

554
00:51:37,762 --> 00:51:39,195
That is the work
of the devil!

555
00:51:39,197 --> 00:51:41,163
Yes!

556
00:51:41,165 --> 00:51:43,532
Why don't you come up here
and help him? Come on!

557
00:51:44,335 --> 00:51:45,768
No!

558
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:47,736
No!

559
00:51:50,141 --> 00:51:52,274
No!

560
00:51:54,345 --> 00:51:55,678
There's someone at the window!

561
00:52:29,212 --> 00:52:30,279
Gisela.

562
00:52:30,281 --> 00:52:31,847
This place is a mess.

563
00:52:33,416 --> 00:52:35,284
Sorry, pius.

564
00:53:16,193 --> 00:53:18,394
Take off your glasses.

565
00:53:18,396 --> 00:53:20,462
Pius, please.

566
00:53:21,898 --> 00:53:23,966
Glasses off!

567
00:53:47,290 --> 00:53:51,994
Your sister, dorothea, has
suddenly fallen very ill.

568
00:53:51,996 --> 00:53:55,431
She was taken to the
hospital for treatment.

569
00:53:55,433 --> 00:53:58,434
Pray for her to get
healthy and let her

570
00:53:58,436 --> 00:54:02,404
example be a
reminder to us all.

571
00:54:25,462 --> 00:54:26,862
Ursel!

572
00:54:28,765 --> 00:54:30,532
What are you doing here?
Go away!

573
00:54:30,534 --> 00:54:31,767
Please.

574
00:54:36,539 --> 00:54:38,040
How's doro?

575
00:54:39,376 --> 00:54:41,310
She'll survive.

576
00:54:41,312 --> 00:54:42,845
I'm sorry.

577
00:54:42,847 --> 00:54:44,380
Will you tell her?

578
00:54:48,718 --> 00:54:51,420
What was that last night?

579
00:54:51,422 --> 00:54:53,055
Men's gathering.

580
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:57,526
What do you have to
do to be taken there?

581
00:54:57,528 --> 00:54:58,961
Why do you ask?

582
00:54:58,963 --> 00:55:01,530
Ursel!

583
00:55:19,049 --> 00:55:20,883
One... more?

584
00:55:20,885 --> 00:55:22,484
One... more?

585
00:55:22,486 --> 00:55:24,486
Okay, do one more!

586
00:55:47,110 --> 00:55:48,510
Mealtime.

587
00:57:00,683 --> 00:57:02,484
Hans?

588
00:57:02,486 --> 00:57:04,753
Men's gathering.

589
00:57:05,622 --> 00:57:08,056
Where is the bloody moron?

590
00:57:08,058 --> 00:57:09,958
Hans!

591
00:57:25,875 --> 00:57:27,676
Fuck it.

592
00:57:40,223 --> 00:57:41,824
So you fooled gisela.

593
00:57:41,826 --> 00:57:43,592
Be my guest.

594
00:57:43,594 --> 00:57:47,663
That's what she deserves,
that fat, ugly, stinking cow.

595
00:57:49,967 --> 00:57:52,468
But that you would
go and defile our

596
00:57:52,470 --> 00:57:57,139
water with your stinking,
whorish, naked body.

597
00:57:57,141 --> 00:57:58,740
Naked!

598
00:57:58,742 --> 00:58:00,209
Oh!

599
00:58:00,211 --> 00:58:01,944
Defies belief.

600
00:58:06,617 --> 00:58:08,684
I took you in
like a daughter.

601
00:58:08,686 --> 00:58:10,786
I made you one of us.

602
00:58:10,788 --> 00:58:13,088
I gave you
everything you need.

603
00:58:13,090 --> 00:58:15,958
Hasn't she lived here
snug as bug in a rug?

604
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:17,926
Yeah!

605
00:58:20,730 --> 00:58:23,499
Now you show
your true face.

606
00:58:23,501 --> 00:58:28,670
For all women are full of lies,
deceit and whorish demons.

607
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:32,674
Your tears won't save you.

608
00:58:32,676 --> 00:58:35,844
As any loving father
should, I will now cleanse

609
00:58:35,846 --> 00:58:39,882
you of the demons
that are within you.

610
00:58:44,087 --> 00:58:46,088
- Yeah!

611
00:58:50,694 --> 00:58:52,861
- Yeah!

612
00:58:56,834 --> 00:58:58,800
- Yeah!

613
00:58:58,802 --> 00:59:00,202
Come on! Show your
brotherly love!

614
00:59:00,204 --> 00:59:01,970
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

615
00:59:07,144 --> 00:59:08,143
Fuck!

616
00:59:08,145 --> 00:59:09,011
Escape! Escape!

617
00:59:10,614 --> 00:59:11,280
Go get the cars!

618
00:59:11,282 --> 00:59:12,681
Get in the cars!

619
00:59:14,652 --> 00:59:16,184
Go! Go! Go!

620
00:59:18,255 --> 00:59:19,788
Get the weapons!

621
00:59:19,790 --> 00:59:21,089
Attention! Attention!

622
00:59:21,091 --> 00:59:24,593
Contact with the electric
fence in sector seven.

623
00:59:24,595 --> 00:59:26,328
All men to be armed.

624
00:59:26,330 --> 00:59:31,300
I repeat: Contact with the
electric fence in sector seven.

625
00:59:33,837 --> 00:59:35,137
Get the dogs!

626
00:59:35,139 --> 00:59:37,072
Get the dogs!

627
00:59:47,884 --> 00:59:49,918
Look, over there!

628
00:59:52,055 --> 00:59:53,188
Here!

629
00:59:54,624 --> 00:59:55,857
Damn it, it's hans.

630
00:59:55,859 --> 00:59:57,859
That idiot must have
run into the fence.

631
00:59:57,861 --> 01:00:01,096
Ah, let's pick him up and
bring him to the hospital.

632
01:00:13,810 --> 01:00:18,180
All I can see is
sadness in your eyes.

633
01:00:19,115 --> 01:00:21,817
There's doubts
in your heart.

634
01:00:21,819 --> 01:00:24,786
Turmoil in your soul.

635
01:00:29,325 --> 01:00:32,628
Oh, you think you
made a mistake.

636
01:00:33,062 --> 01:00:36,064
That you shouldn't
have come here.

637
01:00:36,066 --> 01:00:38,033
You regret.

638
01:00:38,035 --> 01:00:40,869
You regret deeply.

639
01:00:41,704 --> 01:00:43,171
It's okay.

640
01:00:43,173 --> 01:00:45,374
It's okay, Lena.

641
01:00:45,376 --> 01:00:47,843
We're not perfect.

642
01:00:50,213 --> 01:00:52,714
None, none of us.

643
01:00:53,716 --> 01:00:56,785
We all lose our
way sometimes.

644
01:00:59,055 --> 01:01:04,026
The lord loves us,
imperfect as we are.

645
01:01:04,727 --> 01:01:08,664
Open your heart to the
lord and he will requite

646
01:01:08,666 --> 01:01:11,933
all your doings
with his love.

647
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:10,358
Three first.

648
01:02:46,963 --> 01:02:51,299
Attention: This is
today's final schedule.

649
01:02:51,301 --> 01:02:54,503
All nurses will wear
their nurse's uniform.

650
01:02:54,505 --> 01:02:57,272
All others Sunday best.

651
01:02:57,274 --> 01:03:00,942
Aprons must be absolutely
clean and tied at the back

652
01:03:00,944 --> 01:03:03,178
with a ribbon.

653
01:03:03,180 --> 01:03:06,448
After the presidential
limousine has passed by,

654
01:03:06,450 --> 01:03:08,850
we'll all follow
in mixed parade.

655
01:03:08,852 --> 01:03:08,850
That's better.

656
01:03:08,852 --> 01:03:12,888
After the speech all women
are to return to the

657
01:03:12,890 --> 01:03:12,888
women's quarters.

658
01:03:12,890 --> 01:03:19,161
All men will stand at attention
in front of the freihaus.

659
01:03:21,430 --> 01:03:22,964
Thank you.

660
01:03:24,167 --> 01:03:25,300
Quiet.

661
01:03:26,536 --> 01:03:28,136
Quiet!

662
01:03:29,539 --> 01:03:31,239
We'll go through it.

663
01:03:31,874 --> 01:03:33,074
Now you see the car.

664
01:03:36,079 --> 01:03:37,813
Stop!

665
01:03:38,981 --> 01:03:40,315
Very good.

666
01:03:46,957 --> 01:03:48,456
Viva!

667
01:04:14,217 --> 01:04:16,585
Mixed parade!

668
01:05:03,399 --> 01:05:06,401
Mr. president,
my dear friend.

669
01:05:06,403 --> 01:05:12,941
I thank god's wisdom that
the reins of this country

670
01:05:12,943 --> 01:05:14,376
are in your hands.

671
01:05:14,378 --> 01:05:15,977
Daniel?

672
01:05:15,979 --> 01:05:21,583
And you do us the honor of
visiting colonia dignidad.

673
01:05:21,585 --> 01:05:24,085
Meet me at the
potato shed tonight.

674
01:05:26,022 --> 01:05:26,021
I have night shift.

675
01:05:26,023 --> 01:05:30,358
God bless our president
general pinochet!

676
01:05:55,451 --> 01:05:58,353
Knock-offs, but better
than the originals.

677
01:05:58,988 --> 01:06:01,690
Can you provide five hundred
by the end of the year?

678
01:06:01,692 --> 01:06:03,325
If you order now.

679
01:06:03,327 --> 01:06:04,426
And the poison gas.

680
01:06:04,428 --> 01:06:05,460
We want both.

681
01:06:05,462 --> 01:06:08,029
Of course, the
sarin is ready.

682
01:06:11,334 --> 01:06:14,169
How can we be
sure it works?

683
01:06:14,171 --> 01:06:16,271
We could demonstrate
on a dog.

684
01:06:16,273 --> 01:06:19,274
We are not planning
to use it on dogs.

685
01:06:19,276 --> 01:06:20,508
Uh-huh.

686
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:29,317
Everything under god's sun
is good for something.

687
01:06:33,089 --> 01:06:34,155
We desire...

688
01:06:34,157 --> 01:06:35,457
To be sober and pure!

689
01:06:35,459 --> 01:06:36,358
We deny...

690
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:38,259
All lust of the flesh!

691
01:06:38,261 --> 01:06:39,160
We submit...

692
01:06:39,162 --> 01:06:41,062
Ourselves to the lord!

693
01:06:41,064 --> 01:06:43,264
A volunteer
for guard duty?

694
01:06:43,266 --> 01:06:44,399
Huh?

695
01:06:44,401 --> 01:06:45,567
Not you, hans.

696
01:06:45,569 --> 01:06:47,502
Why not?

697
01:06:50,106 --> 01:06:52,374
Why don't you let him?

698
01:06:52,376 --> 01:06:54,275
For once?

699
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:54,169
I'm so sorry they brought
you here as well.

700
01:07:56,072 --> 01:07:58,440
Nobody brought me here.

701
01:08:01,677 --> 01:08:04,612
I joined up...

702
01:08:04,614 --> 01:08:06,714
To find you.

703
01:08:27,136 --> 01:08:29,337
Schafer understands that
family gives you home,

704
01:08:29,339 --> 01:08:31,473
a sense of belonging.

705
01:08:31,475 --> 01:08:33,408
So he broke up the
families, separated men

706
01:08:33,410 --> 01:08:35,310
from women, children
from their parents.

707
01:08:35,312 --> 01:08:37,445
That's why he
became so powerful.

708
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:40,248
Well then how they have the
children in the first place?

709
01:08:40,250 --> 01:08:42,350
Once in a while he gives
them permission to meet,

710
01:08:42,352 --> 01:08:44,352
but the children don't
know their parents.

711
01:08:44,354 --> 01:08:47,422
They take away the babies from
their mothers at three months.

712
01:08:47,424 --> 01:08:48,756
How do you know
all of this?

713
01:08:48,758 --> 01:08:50,291
They don't hide
anything from me.

714
01:08:50,293 --> 01:08:51,826
I'm just a retard.

715
01:08:54,563 --> 01:08:56,531
We have to get
out of here.

716
01:08:56,533 --> 01:08:59,734
It's all fenced in,
the entire compound.

717
01:08:59,736 --> 01:09:01,636
They even have
spring guns.

718
01:09:01,638 --> 01:09:04,439
I almost got killed, when
i tried to get away.

719
01:09:04,773 --> 01:09:06,307
When was that?

720
01:09:06,309 --> 01:09:07,709
About three months ago.

721
01:09:07,711 --> 01:09:09,310
That's why you
weren't there.

722
01:09:09,312 --> 01:09:10,445
Where?

723
01:09:10,447 --> 01:09:13,248
Men's gathering.

724
01:09:13,250 --> 01:09:16,184
I made them take me there
so that you would see me.

725
01:09:21,224 --> 01:09:23,158
There's something down there.

726
01:09:36,672 --> 01:09:39,374
Wait, I'll go
and have a look.

727
01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:52,487
It's a tunnel.

728
01:10:22,285 --> 01:10:23,418
Fuck.

729
01:10:55,584 --> 01:10:56,751
Daniel!

730
01:11:15,537 --> 01:11:16,604
Lena.

731
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:19,374
Is it time already?

732
01:11:19,376 --> 01:11:21,509
What do you think
I'm here for?

733
01:11:22,478 --> 01:11:24,479
Uh, I'm not finished, yet.

734
01:11:28,417 --> 01:11:30,385
So you'll continue
tomorrow.

735
01:11:33,289 --> 01:11:35,290
Come now.

736
01:13:42,518 --> 01:13:43,584
Attention.

737
01:13:43,586 --> 01:13:45,720
Lena, come to see pius.

738
01:13:45,722 --> 01:13:49,123
Lena, come to see
pius immediately!

739
01:14:05,874 --> 01:14:07,742
How long?

740
01:14:07,744 --> 01:14:10,978
Seven minutes,
twenty-three seconds.

741
01:14:10,980 --> 01:14:13,714
If your conscience was
clear, you would have been

742
01:14:13,716 --> 01:14:15,917
here in less than five.

743
01:14:16,552 --> 01:14:18,019
Come.

744
01:14:37,973 --> 01:14:40,007
Look at her.

745
01:14:40,009 --> 01:14:42,176
She's the savvy one.

746
01:14:43,512 --> 01:14:45,947
Keeps her eyes open.

747
01:14:45,949 --> 01:14:49,150
She knows what's
going on, right?

748
01:14:55,791 --> 01:14:57,658
Do you know ursel?

749
01:14:59,862 --> 01:15:02,129
She got brains.

750
01:15:02,131 --> 01:15:05,166
But the brainy ones,
you can't trust them.

751
01:15:05,168 --> 01:15:07,034
They lose their
way too easily.

752
01:15:07,036 --> 01:15:08,736
Yes.

753
01:15:09,071 --> 01:15:12,707
So I want you to keep an
eye on ursel, tell me what

754
01:15:12,709 --> 01:15:14,642
you see and hear.

755
01:15:14,644 --> 01:15:18,579
Because there's something going
on with her and I can smell it.

756
01:15:19,081 --> 01:15:21,749
I hardly ever see ursel.

757
01:15:21,751 --> 01:15:23,985
Well I can fix that.

758
01:15:43,171 --> 01:15:44,639
Go.

759
01:16:01,056 --> 01:16:02,890
What are you doing here?

760
01:16:04,192 --> 01:16:05,960
Just helping out.

761
01:16:12,834 --> 01:16:14,168
What's wrong?

762
01:16:19,741 --> 01:16:21,809
I just don't know how
you stand it here.

763
01:16:26,815 --> 01:16:28,983
I was nine when
we came here.

764
01:16:28,985 --> 01:16:31,085
I don't know
anything else.

765
01:16:38,894 --> 01:16:40,895
Your parents
are here, too?

766
01:16:48,370 --> 01:16:50,972
Gisela is my mother.

767
01:16:56,980 --> 01:16:58,879
Inhale, exhale.

768
01:17:13,395 --> 01:17:14,762
Physically he's fine.

769
01:17:14,764 --> 01:17:14,762
Fine.

770
01:17:14,764 --> 01:17:19,300
But we should take some
blood as well and analyze it.

771
01:17:20,035 --> 01:17:21,202
Blood test.

772
01:17:28,143 --> 01:17:31,045
Let's wait for the blood count
and test the gas tomorrow.

773
01:17:31,047 --> 01:17:32,847
Thank you my friend.

774
01:17:54,036 --> 01:17:56,070
It's an entire system
of tunnels.

775
01:17:56,072 --> 01:17:57,872
I figured it
out last night.

776
01:17:57,874 --> 01:17:59,874
You won't believe what
they built down there.

777
01:18:00,242 --> 01:18:02,910
It's kilometers of shafts
with electricity and air

778
01:18:02,912 --> 01:18:05,046
ventilation and
everything.

779
01:18:05,048 --> 01:18:06,881
But there's this one tunnel
which is blocked

780
01:18:06,883 --> 01:18:08,115
by a metal door.

781
01:18:08,117 --> 01:18:10,885
It's the only tunnel
which is blocked.

782
01:18:10,887 --> 01:18:12,720
This shaft heads
right for the fence.

783
01:18:12,722 --> 01:18:13,754
I think it leads outside.

784
01:18:13,756 --> 01:18:14,822
Out of the colony.

785
01:18:14,824 --> 01:18:15,956
Are you sure?

786
01:18:15,958 --> 01:18:17,758
We have to give it a try.

787
01:18:19,895 --> 01:18:21,862
I also found another exit.

788
01:18:21,864 --> 01:18:24,165
It leads out into
the workshop.

789
01:18:24,167 --> 01:18:26,300
The tunnels connect
the entire colonia.

790
01:18:26,302 --> 01:18:26,300
It's really crazy.

791
01:18:26,302 --> 01:18:31,772
And I'm sure, only Schafer and
a few others know about it.

792
01:18:31,774 --> 01:18:33,908
I mean, there is like a
whole secret world going

793
01:18:33,910 --> 01:18:37,812
on underneath and most of
them, they have no clue.

794
01:18:43,118 --> 01:18:44,819
Lena, I'm sure
we can make it.

795
01:18:44,821 --> 01:18:47,188
We can get out through the
tunnels, but we have to

796
01:18:47,190 --> 01:18:48,222
leave tonight.

797
01:18:48,224 --> 01:18:49,423
Tonight?

798
01:18:49,425 --> 01:18:51,392
They're preparing a
test for tomorrow.

799
01:18:51,394 --> 01:18:52,827
What test?

800
01:18:56,331 --> 01:18:58,432
Poison gas.

801
01:18:58,434 --> 01:19:00,968
The idea is I...

802
01:19:00,970 --> 01:19:02,937
I won't survive.

803
01:19:03,438 --> 01:19:05,306
My god.

804
01:19:06,408 --> 01:19:07,875
Look after these.

805
01:19:07,877 --> 01:19:09,844
In case I don't make it.

806
01:19:10,846 --> 01:19:12,913
What is this?

807
01:19:12,915 --> 01:19:14,782
Pictures I took
from the tunnels.

808
01:19:14,784 --> 01:19:16,784
The underground rooms.

809
01:19:16,786 --> 01:19:19,453
We have to prove what's
going on in here.

810
01:19:19,455 --> 01:19:20,821
I don't wanna prove
anything, I just want to

811
01:19:20,823 --> 01:19:20,821
get out of here alive.

812
01:19:20,823 --> 01:19:24,058
But we have to nail these
guys, we have to stop this.

813
01:19:24,060 --> 01:19:25,259
With a few photographs?

814
01:19:25,261 --> 01:19:27,228
Yes!

815
01:19:27,230 --> 01:19:29,029
Don't you get it?

816
01:19:29,031 --> 01:19:30,831
If you hadn't taken those
photos in Santiago we

817
01:19:30,833 --> 01:19:32,366
wouldn't even be here.

818
01:19:32,368 --> 01:19:34,201
So do me a favor, stop
playing the revolutionary,

819
01:19:34,203 --> 01:19:35,936
hell-bent on
saving the world.

820
01:19:35,938 --> 01:19:37,538
You're gonna
get us killed!

821
01:20:18,413 --> 01:20:19,980
And no chattering.

822
01:20:19,982 --> 01:20:21,182
What shall I peel with?

823
01:20:21,184 --> 01:20:23,284
Didn't you bring
your knife?

824
01:20:23,952 --> 01:20:25,286
How stupid can you be?

825
01:20:25,288 --> 01:20:27,822
-I didn't know...
-Not another word!

826
01:20:27,824 --> 01:20:29,356
I'll get you a knife.

827
01:20:44,005 --> 01:20:45,472
Why are you here?

828
01:20:46,575 --> 01:20:48,475
You tell me.

829
01:20:49,010 --> 01:20:53,447
You think I don't know
Schafer told you to spy on me?

830
01:20:53,449 --> 01:20:56,917
Maybe he told me
to spy on you, too.

831
01:20:58,220 --> 01:20:59,486
You've got brains, Lena.

832
01:20:59,488 --> 01:21:01,922
Just like ursel.

833
01:21:01,924 --> 01:21:03,357
But the brainy
ones are dangerous.

834
01:21:07,896 --> 01:21:09,997
Why is he doing all this?

835
01:21:09,999 --> 01:21:11,165
The whole place.

836
01:21:11,167 --> 01:21:13,033
I don't understand it.

837
01:21:13,035 --> 01:21:15,369
Because there is
nothing to understand.

838
01:21:15,371 --> 01:21:17,271
He loves it.

839
01:21:17,273 --> 01:21:20,140
His power, the music,
the little boys.

840
01:21:20,142 --> 01:21:22,610
It's his heaven on earth.

841
01:21:25,180 --> 01:21:27,915
Did you really believe
he was a man of god?

842
01:21:27,917 --> 01:21:29,316
Of course.

843
01:21:30,352 --> 01:21:32,486
But not anymore.

844
01:21:40,362 --> 01:21:42,363
So have the
two of you met?

845
01:21:45,333 --> 01:21:46,934
What do you mean?

846
01:21:49,170 --> 01:21:51,305
You know what I mean.

847
01:21:52,474 --> 01:21:55,576
The picture
inside your cross.

848
01:21:55,578 --> 01:21:58,545
So foolish of you, Lena.

849
01:21:58,547 --> 01:22:00,347
And when nobody's
watching, he's not so

850
01:22:00,349 --> 01:22:03,183
retarded anymore.

851
01:22:08,290 --> 01:22:10,491
You're planning to escape.

852
01:22:11,593 --> 01:22:13,360
No.

853
01:22:16,264 --> 01:22:18,465
I am pregnant, Lena.

854
01:22:18,467 --> 01:22:21,001
And I think they know.

855
01:22:21,003 --> 01:22:22,369
And he won't accept it.

856
01:22:22,371 --> 01:22:23,504
They'll kill it.

857
01:22:23,506 --> 01:22:26,073
And probably me, too.

858
01:22:26,075 --> 01:22:28,342
But the father?

859
01:22:28,344 --> 01:22:30,377
He's not from here.

860
01:22:30,379 --> 01:22:33,147
He was taken here,
just like your hans.

861
01:22:33,149 --> 01:22:36,150
And I took care of
him at the hospital.

862
01:22:36,152 --> 01:22:37,685
Where is he now?

863
01:22:38,987 --> 01:22:40,554
He's nowhere.

864
01:22:40,556 --> 01:22:42,623
Didn't make it.

865
01:22:53,368 --> 01:22:55,669
That potato you're holding,
it's the same one

866
01:22:55,671 --> 01:22:57,304
you had when I left.

867
01:22:57,306 --> 01:22:59,440
Take your things, go
and sit back there.

868
01:22:59,442 --> 01:23:02,543
You'll only
gossip otherwise.

869
01:23:19,361 --> 01:23:21,428
Lena?

870
01:23:30,338 --> 01:23:33,107
It's always the same,
always the brainy ones.

871
01:23:33,109 --> 01:23:34,575
Where did you
get this from?

872
01:23:34,577 --> 01:23:35,609
I found it.

873
01:23:35,611 --> 01:23:37,411
Really, just like that?

874
01:23:39,080 --> 01:23:41,115
I'll find out, even if i
have to carve it out of

875
01:23:41,117 --> 01:23:45,319
flesh with a blunt fork,
so where did you get it from?

876
01:23:45,321 --> 01:23:46,286
I found it.

877
01:23:46,288 --> 01:23:47,755
Where did you get it from?

878
01:23:49,325 --> 01:23:50,791
Get out!

879
01:23:52,460 --> 01:23:53,527
Get out!

880
01:23:53,529 --> 01:23:56,230
I-i had it.

881
01:23:59,768 --> 01:24:01,602
You said what?

882
01:24:03,038 --> 01:24:05,205
This picture, hans,
belongs to you?

883
01:24:05,207 --> 01:24:06,240
Uh-huh.

884
01:24:07,776 --> 01:24:10,411
Where did you get it from?

885
01:24:10,413 --> 01:24:14,048
If I tell you, uncle
bernd is gonna hit me.

886
01:24:18,486 --> 01:24:21,355
No, uncle bernd
won't hit you.

887
01:24:30,799 --> 01:24:32,299
Hans.

888
01:24:32,667 --> 01:24:35,436
In, in there.

889
01:24:36,071 --> 01:24:37,838
Open up the darkroom.

890
01:24:49,684 --> 01:24:52,386
The red, red book.

891
01:24:53,088 --> 01:24:54,621
Red book.

892
01:25:04,833 --> 01:25:06,200
I didn't take these.

893
01:25:06,202 --> 01:25:08,435
I'm impressed, bernd.

894
01:25:09,170 --> 01:25:10,437
These are great.

895
01:25:10,439 --> 01:25:14,108
It wasn't me, pius,
please, i--

896
01:25:15,710 --> 01:25:17,878
don't worry.

897
01:25:18,580 --> 01:25:20,647
The truth will
set you free.

898
01:25:20,649 --> 01:25:22,616
Goldilocks can go now.

899
01:25:22,618 --> 01:25:26,320
We're going to have a chat
with our good brother bernd.

900
01:25:27,655 --> 01:25:30,791
Well, get out,
both of you sluts!

901
01:26:04,692 --> 01:26:06,193
Lena?

902
01:26:09,197 --> 01:26:10,364
Lena!

903
01:26:22,912 --> 01:26:24,578
We'll go through the
workshop. It's quicker.

904
01:26:24,580 --> 01:26:26,413
We're taking ursel with us,
she's in the potato shed.

905
01:26:26,415 --> 01:26:27,447
Are you insane?

906
01:26:27,449 --> 01:26:28,515
That's too far.

907
01:26:28,517 --> 01:26:30,217
I'm not going
without ursel.

908
01:26:32,521 --> 01:26:33,453
Oh shit.

909
01:26:33,455 --> 01:26:34,721
Let's go!

910
01:26:36,691 --> 01:26:37,691
Go! Go! Go!

911
01:26:37,693 --> 01:26:39,526
Come on! Come on!

912
01:26:39,961 --> 01:26:43,664
Urgently searching for
brother hans and sister Lena.

913
01:26:43,666 --> 01:26:46,466
They need to be
found immediately.

914
01:26:48,836 --> 01:26:48,835
What's going on?

915
01:26:48,837 --> 01:26:52,606
We're getting out of
here, and you are, too.

916
01:26:59,781 --> 01:27:00,914
Come on!

917
01:27:01,482 --> 01:27:03,383
Move it! Move!

918
01:27:03,385 --> 01:27:04,585
Come on!

919
01:27:33,881 --> 01:27:35,782
What is this?

920
01:27:35,784 --> 01:27:37,384
You didn't know?

921
01:27:37,386 --> 01:27:38,352
No.

922
01:27:39,988 --> 01:27:41,421
Hurry up!

923
01:27:42,991 --> 01:27:43,924
Take me to hans's room.

924
01:27:43,926 --> 01:27:45,525
Come on! Get in!

925
01:28:00,308 --> 01:28:01,942
What do we do?

926
01:28:20,695 --> 01:28:22,029
It's only a few meters.

927
01:28:22,031 --> 01:28:23,930
And there's light
on the other side.

928
01:28:23,932 --> 01:28:24,798
I can't do it.

929
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:26,466
You wanna go back?

930
01:28:27,435 --> 01:28:28,669
No.

931
01:28:34,575 --> 01:28:35,842
Is that hans's bed?

932
01:28:35,844 --> 01:28:36,977
Yes.

933
01:28:57,031 --> 01:28:58,498
You go.

934
01:28:58,500 --> 01:28:59,533
You go first.

935
01:28:59,535 --> 01:29:00,600
Go.

936
01:29:07,008 --> 01:29:09,676
That goddamn fucking liar.

937
01:29:16,384 --> 01:29:17,451
Go.

938
01:29:48,916 --> 01:29:50,384
Ursel?

939
01:29:52,920 --> 01:29:53,920
Ursel?

940
01:30:27,955 --> 01:30:28,989
Ursel?

941
01:30:33,861 --> 01:30:34,961
Wait!

942
01:31:18,506 --> 01:31:19,706
We made it.

943
01:31:30,818 --> 01:31:31,918
Come on.

944
01:31:39,560 --> 01:31:43,497
Your brother hans and your
sisters, ursel and Lena,

945
01:31:43,499 --> 01:31:48,802
have lost their way and have
forsaken our good lord.

946
01:31:48,804 --> 01:31:53,173
Pray for them so they find their
way home where they belong.

947
01:31:53,175 --> 01:31:55,141
I'm outside.

948
01:31:55,143 --> 01:31:56,810
Yes.

949
01:31:59,914 --> 01:32:01,548
Thank you.

950
01:32:02,917 --> 01:32:03,917
Thank you.

951
01:32:08,190 --> 01:32:09,022
Let's go.

952
01:32:09,024 --> 01:32:10,624
Yes, let's go.

953
01:32:20,702 --> 01:32:21,635
No!

954
01:32:21,637 --> 01:32:23,169
Stay, stay!

955
01:32:24,805 --> 01:32:25,805
Stay!

956
01:32:45,293 --> 01:32:47,060
Lena, let's go.

957
01:32:47,628 --> 01:32:48,728
They'll be here
any second.

958
01:32:48,730 --> 01:32:50,163
Come on, Lena!

959
01:32:50,165 --> 01:32:50,897
Come.

960
01:32:50,899 --> 01:32:52,332
No!

961
01:33:10,118 --> 01:33:10,951
Hey!

962
01:33:10,953 --> 01:33:12,786
-Hey!
-Hey!

963
01:33:39,113 --> 01:33:40,780
It's okay now.

964
01:33:41,949 --> 01:33:43,617
We're safe.

965
01:33:47,154 --> 01:33:48,321
Yeah.

966
01:33:49,657 --> 01:33:51,157
We're safe.

967
01:33:55,363 --> 01:33:57,764
You know, she
was pregnant.

968
01:34:03,037 --> 01:34:05,705
If I hadn't made her come,
she'd still be alive.

969
01:34:06,807 --> 01:34:08,842
It wasn't your fault.

970
01:34:08,844 --> 01:34:11,044
-No?
-No.

971
01:34:18,019 --> 01:34:19,386
I'm sorry.

972
01:35:05,299 --> 01:35:07,067
The ambassador is
ready to see you now.

973
01:35:07,069 --> 01:35:08,468
Would you follow me?

974
01:35:12,306 --> 01:35:13,907
This way, please.

975
01:35:19,146 --> 01:35:21,147
These are the
pictures I took.

976
01:35:36,063 --> 01:35:37,097
Good work.

977
01:35:38,766 --> 01:35:40,500
Thank you.

978
01:35:40,502 --> 01:35:41,468
Passports.

979
01:35:41,470 --> 01:35:43,169
Hot off the press.

980
01:35:43,171 --> 01:35:46,339
And this should fit,
uh, more or less.

981
01:35:46,341 --> 01:35:48,141
But I'm afraid there are
no more seats on today's

982
01:35:48,143 --> 01:35:49,976
flight, so I reserved
for the next one.

983
01:35:49,978 --> 01:35:51,211
What?

984
01:35:51,213 --> 01:35:52,946
In a week's time?

985
01:35:52,948 --> 01:35:54,114
I'm sorry, yes.

986
01:35:54,116 --> 01:35:56,349
We can't wait
for another week.

987
01:35:56,951 --> 01:35:58,485
What day is it today?

988
01:35:58,487 --> 01:36:00,253
Wednesday.

989
01:36:01,188 --> 01:36:03,089
We have a fifty-fifty chance.

990
01:36:03,091 --> 01:36:04,424
Hello?

991
01:36:05,226 --> 01:36:07,060
Is this the ritz?

992
01:36:07,062 --> 01:36:09,262
Could you put me through
to one of your guests?

993
01:36:09,264 --> 01:36:11,364
Roman breuer.

994
01:36:11,366 --> 01:36:13,466
B, r...

995
01:36:13,468 --> 01:36:15,101
Thank you.

996
01:36:15,103 --> 01:36:16,503
Roman?

997
01:36:16,505 --> 01:36:18,004
It's Lena.

998
01:36:18,006 --> 01:36:20,240
It's so good to
hear your voice.

999
01:36:20,242 --> 01:36:24,911
Tell me, are you by any
chance flying today?

1000
01:36:25,880 --> 01:36:25,879
Oh my god.

1001
01:36:28,249 --> 01:36:31,084
They've got themselves two
seats on the today's flight.

1002
01:36:31,086 --> 01:36:33,953
Yes, they're leaving for
the airport just now.

1003
01:36:34,855 --> 01:36:37,857
The colonia dignidad is
very powerful here in Chile.

1004
01:36:37,859 --> 01:36:39,359
They're probably already
at the airport to make

1005
01:36:39,361 --> 01:36:40,860
sure you won't
leave the country.

1006
01:36:40,862 --> 01:36:42,362
I will personally
take you there.

1007
01:36:42,364 --> 01:36:45,165
With my diplomatic status
I'll get you through

1008
01:36:45,167 --> 01:36:47,934
border control,
so you'll be safe.

1009
01:36:48,903 --> 01:36:49,969
The photos?

1010
01:36:49,971 --> 01:36:51,404
You've got them?

1011
01:36:51,406 --> 01:36:53,273
Shit.

1012
01:36:55,342 --> 01:36:56,943
Just a minute.

1013
01:37:03,450 --> 01:37:05,051
What are you doing?

1014
01:37:16,964 --> 01:37:17,997
What was that?

1015
01:37:17,999 --> 01:37:17,997
Oh, nothing really.

1016
01:37:17,999 --> 01:37:21,534
We, ah, just forgot
the photographs.

1017
01:37:21,536 --> 01:37:25,205
And we need them, because
we're going to nail these guys.

1018
01:37:49,196 --> 01:37:50,597
Why aren't we getting out?

1019
01:37:50,599 --> 01:37:51,965
You're safe here.

1020
01:37:51,967 --> 01:37:51,965
Where are we going?

1021
01:37:51,967 --> 01:37:55,902
To an underground entrance
so you won't be seen.

1022
01:37:56,637 --> 01:37:58,304
Relax.

1023
01:38:10,618 --> 01:38:12,585
It may not be the most
comfortable place,

1024
01:38:12,587 --> 01:38:14,888
but it's absolutely safe.

1025
01:38:18,592 --> 01:38:21,261
I'll pick you up as
soon boarding begins.

1026
01:38:22,596 --> 01:38:24,030

Is Lena here?

1031
01:38:31,039 --> 01:38:32,605
Haven't seen her.

1032
01:38:33,173 --> 01:38:34,207
Could you check with
the gate, please?

1033
01:38:34,209 --> 01:38:35,174
Sure.

1034

Shit.

1046

They must not reach the plane.
