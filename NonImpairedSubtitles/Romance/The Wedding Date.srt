Can't wait to meet you. '

It's a plane ticket.

For my sister's wedding, in London.

You need to let go.

'all remaining passengers
please make your way... '

58
00:05:36,302 --> 00:05:39,328
Harry, I'm not working,
I'm going to my sister's wedding.

59
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:42,136
Customer service
will have to survive without me.

60
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:45,633
But Kat, we've had three delays
and two reps call in sick.

61
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:49,375
And a 2505 on the 8:20 CPT to LGW.

62
00:05:49,415 --> 00:05:51,349
And there's this guy on line two

63
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:55,821
who gut stuck with in-laws because
we couldn't get him out of Heathrow.

64
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:59,814
I'd love to help you, sincerely,
but I haven't seen my family in two years

65
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:02,225
and my flight leaves in 15 minutes.

66
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:06,790
Come on, Kat. Please, I'm begging you.

67
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:13,572
Bump the 14:14 to the upper on 16:10.

68
00:06:13,606 --> 00:06:15,665
What about line two?

69
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:19,068
Check my bags.

70
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:23,173
I understand, you want your family
to see you the way you see yourself,

71
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:25,810
or would, if you didn't feeI
so victimized by them.

72
00:06:26,018 --> 00:06:28,509
Hello!

73
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:33,548
We regret that you were inconvenienced.
Unfortunately, we are not liable.

74
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:39,765
But just this once I'll refund your ticket
and credit you 10,000 frequent flyer miles.

75
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:42,290
Thank you for calling Virgin Atlantic.

76
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:54,775
Your first trip?

77
00:06:58,117 --> 00:07:01,382
My sister's getting married
and the best man is my ex.

78
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:04,686
If I chicken out,
I wanna know where the exits are.

79
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:14,496
I'm not a knuckler, I fly all the time.

80
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:16,764
The reason I can't feeI my legs

81
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:19,966
is that any second
my date is gonna sit down in 3B

82
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:22,338
and I need him to look really good today.

83
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:25,511
Hello, 3B.

84
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:37,483
Thank you.

85
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,652
Hey.

86
00:07:42,695 --> 00:07:44,492
Kat.

87
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:50,693
Let's sit.

88
00:08:01,247 --> 00:08:03,238
I'm glad you found it OK.

89
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:06,211
The airport... The plane, I mean.

90
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:12,082
I'm sorry we couldn't leave sooner. I know you
wanted to get settled before the party.

91
00:08:12,124 --> 00:08:14,115
Work must be crazy.

92
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,366
Oh, I should warn you.

93
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:30,773
You know those families
where everyone's out of their mind

94
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:33,176
but they're your family so you love them?

95
00:08:33,212 --> 00:08:34,839
Mine's not like that.

96
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:50,495
I love my dad.

97
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:54,364
But since he's my stepdad,
he's technically not family.

98
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,027
He's more like a hostage.

99
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:10,942
'Ladies and gentlemen,

100
00:09:10,983 --> 00:09:14,612
'we will shortly be arriving

109
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:41,138
Oh.

110
00:09:43,816 --> 00:09:47,377
Nick, please tell me
you're not wearing that tonight.

111
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,786
I am.

112
00:09:49,822 --> 00:09:55,351
It's no big deaI really, it just looks like
a tailor made your tie out of my dress.

113
00:09:55,394 --> 00:10:01,333
Don't get me wrong - matching's fine.
It's matchy-matchy you wanna look out for.

114
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:05,394
- We look like we're trying too hard.
- Exactly.

115
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:09,169
I want us to look like we fit
but not like we're trying to look like we fit.

116
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:11,199
Let me teach you a trick.

117
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:15,407
If you look people in the eye,
they'll never notice what you're wearing.

118
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:18,576
There's no way I'm showing up
in his and her outfits

119
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:21,815
so if you're gonna wear that tie,
I have to change my dress.

120
00:10:21,854 --> 00:10:24,789
Driver, will you please
pull over somewhere?

121
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:34,663
I'm sorry. I promise this is the last one.

122
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,362
You must think...
Who knows what you think?

123
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:39,871
I know how important this is for you.

124
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:44,035
But remember, you're a beautifuI woman
and you've got everything going for you.

125
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:45,771
Don't patronize me.

126
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:49,571
I feeI like crap but I wanna look hot doing it.

127
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:55,218
Mission accomplished.

128
00:10:55,254 --> 00:10:56,721
Really?

129
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:59,956
Don't get too attached.

130
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:09,524
I prefer the red one.

131
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:12,897
I'II let her know.

132
00:11:16,742 --> 00:11:18,209
Hmm...

133
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:21,179
"Hmm, nice dress," or "Hmm...

134
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:23,807
"Gorgeous. I was insane to let you go"?

135
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,584
Well, I'd shag you.

136
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,520
If that's all right with you?

137
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:42,164
I don't know if I can do this.

138
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:46,331
Well, you can never be sure of anything
but we still have to go inside.

139
00:11:56,315 --> 00:11:59,341
- Aunt Bea!
- Dear girI.

140
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:02,320
This should have been you getting married.

141
00:12:02,354 --> 00:12:05,551
You know, you didn't have
to return the gravy boat.

142
00:12:05,591 --> 00:12:08,788
And to think Jeffrey is the best man.

143
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:10,728
Have you met Nick?

144
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:12,754
- How do you do?
- Oh.

145
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:15,790
Charming.

146
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:17,462
And what do you do?

147
00:12:18,838 --> 00:12:20,100
Excuse us.

148
00:12:25,644 --> 00:12:27,805
What a nightmare.

149
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:33,277
OK, we need a story.

150
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:37,779
You're a therapist, we just started dating and
you're crazy about me.

151
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:42,457
Count it. 6,000 even.

152
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:46,192
- Oh, I trust you.
- No. Count it.

153
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:51,763
All right.

154
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:03,779
I'll cover expenses but if you want
to be intimate, we talk money first.

155
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:07,775
That won't be an issue. I find the idea
of sex for money morally repugnant.

156
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:11,915
I'm sorry. No offense.

157
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:16,021
Do me a favor, quit apologizing.

158
00:13:16,061 --> 00:13:19,155
If you look at this as a business transaction,

159
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:21,928
maybe you won't
feeI compelled to keep saying sorry.

160
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,457
I'm sorry.

161
00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:25,197
It's also really annoying.

162
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,343
Sorry.

163
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:44,618
- Sorry.
- Pussy Kat! What happened to you?

164
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:49,151
- Pull over for a quickie?
- Mom, this is so not the time to be yourself.

165
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:51,830
And who might this be?

166
00:13:51,864 --> 00:13:54,594
Hi. I'm the new guy.
It's great to meet you.

167
00:13:54,633 --> 00:13:58,125
Lovely. This is a marathon, not a sprint.

168
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,195
We've got welcome cocktails today

169
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:03,538
then tomorrow's Young People In The Park
and Stags And Hens.

170
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:10,004
Friday's the picnic, then the rehearsaI dinner
and since you have left no margin for jetlag,

171
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:12,142
I need you to hydrate.

172
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:20,052
- Dad.
- My darling.

173
00:14:21,827 --> 00:14:24,318
- Meet Nick.
- Professor Ellis.

174
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:26,695
- How do you do?
- Kat?

175
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:30,602
- Kat! Oooh! I'm getting married! Oh, Kitty!
- Hey!

176
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:32,160
Oh, I missed you so much.

177
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:35,139
Gosh, who's the hunky, huh? Nice.

178
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:37,734
There you are! Get over here!

179
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:42,803
At times like these,
I find a good, stiff drink helps.

180
00:14:42,848 --> 00:14:45,840
- Can I get you a refill, sir?
- Very kind of you.

181
00:14:46,852 --> 00:14:48,786
Where did you find him?

182
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:50,550
Thank you.

183
00:14:51,857 --> 00:14:53,518
Yellow Pages.

184
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:57,420
Hello!

185
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:03,030
Sweet Jesus.
Who gave that woman an amp?

186
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:05,298
Hello. Hello?

187
00:15:05,337 --> 00:15:08,500
Oh. WonderfuI. It's finally working.

188
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:12,943
Does everybody have a drink?
Because I am going to say a few words.

189
00:15:12,978 --> 00:15:15,708
Welcome, friends and family...

190
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:18,216
I'm...

191
00:15:18,784 --> 00:15:21,252
Victor and I are so happy

192
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:24,222
that you're here to celebrate with us

193
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:28,659
as we welcome Edward and
the Fletcher-Wootens into our family.

194
00:15:28,694 --> 00:15:33,290
We always thought that
we would marry off Kat first.

195
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:38,133
We had good reason to hope because
she was so popular with the boys at schooI

196
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:40,138
and we came pretty close once,

197
00:15:40,172 --> 00:15:43,630
but, as you all know,
that crashed and burned.

198
00:15:44,376 --> 00:15:47,812
Luckily, we were able
to get the deposit back,

199
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:51,407
so here we are again...

200
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:57,078
To the bride and groom.

201
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:03,053
Oh. Yes. Yes. Well, back
to the bride and groom to be.

202
00:16:04,196 --> 00:16:06,494
Um...

203
00:16:06,532 --> 00:16:12,767
Edward, we are so glad that
you fell in love with the girI next door.

204
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:15,638
Our Amy. Congratulations, babies.

205
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:18,336
Congratulations.

206
00:16:31,523 --> 00:16:32,615
Jeffrey.

207
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:36,193
Hello. Kat-mandu.

208
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:51,669
Wow, you look gorgeous.

209
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:54,805
Gorgeous.

210
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:57,179
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

211
00:16:57,216 --> 00:17:01,084
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God, oh, my God! Top Kat! Ooooh!

212
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,557
Where the bloody hell have you been?
I have gynecologists that call more often.

213
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:10,221
- You have more than one?
- I play them off against each other.

214
00:17:10,262 --> 00:17:14,426
Hello, arsehole.
Since you dumped my cousin brutally,

215
00:17:14,466 --> 00:17:16,832
you won't mind if I steaI her away, will you?

216
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,928
Thanks.

217
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:28,011
- You didn't have to do that.
- I wasn't saving you from him,

218
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,072
I was saving you from yourself.

219
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:33,278
You, my love, are too bloody nice.

220
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,349
I've never seen so many
beautifuI women in one room.

221
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,789
Did he bring a date?

222
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:42,794
Darling, why waste time on that horse's arse

223
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:46,389
when Mr. Tie Me Up, Tie Me Down
is waiting for you over there?

224
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:48,832
- What does he do?
- He's a therapist.

225
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:53,167
- The perils of paranoia.
- Yes.

226
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:55,435
Oh, God. I think I've just come.

227
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:04,513
Thank you.

228
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,541
Can I have that?

229
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,586
Hm.

230
00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:21,764
Thank you.

231
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,234
You know what I love about all this, Kat?

232
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:27,136
There's finally a reason for
the world to revolve around you?

233
00:18:27,172 --> 00:18:28,969
Exactly.

234
00:18:31,677 --> 00:18:34,578
- There you are.
- How's the future missus?

235
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:36,808
I'm perfect, I'm all ginny.

236
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:39,249
Thanks, Snufflepop.

237
00:18:43,155 --> 00:18:45,589
Mmm! Mm-mm-mm!

238
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:48,619
Wow!

239
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:51,527
Am I not the luckiest bastard on earth?

240
00:18:51,563 --> 00:18:55,329
Aw! Well, I'll dance to that.

241
00:18:56,902 --> 00:18:58,870
- Oh!
- Oh, Jesus!

242
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:03,740
That's what he gets
for not taking dance lessons

243
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:06,266
untiI two days before the wedding.

244
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:09,178
Who's ever heard of
dance lessons for a wedding?

245
00:19:09,214 --> 00:19:11,648
Just about everyone.

246
00:19:11,683 --> 00:19:13,514
You are taking the piss?

247
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:15,179
We'll go with you.

248
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:18,189
I don't even know you, hunky dunky,
and I love you already.

249
00:19:19,024 --> 00:19:23,188
Dance lessons? Hm. Right.

250
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:35,766
- Hey.
- Oh. Hello.

251
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:43,780
Weddings are a celebration
of love and commitment...

252
00:19:43,815 --> 00:19:45,476
in Utopia.

253
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:49,578
In the reaI world they're an excuse to drink
excessively and say things you shouldn't.

254
00:19:49,621 --> 00:19:53,785
- A philosopher, huh?
- Well, shrink.

255
00:19:53,825 --> 00:19:55,986
- Crikey!
- What?

256
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:58,019
- No, nothing.
- No, tell me.

257
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:01,025
Well, you Yanks and your therapy,

258
00:20:01,066 --> 00:20:04,297
it's a load of touchy-feely mumbo jumbo.

259
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:08,706
Spilling your guts to a totaI stranger,
it's not naturaI.

260
00:20:12,177 --> 00:20:14,168
Oh, God.

261
00:20:15,681 --> 00:20:17,171
It's just...

262
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:22,085
There's this girI that I care for...
Well, I suppose you could say I love her.

263
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:26,721
The bugger is,
she's here with some other guy.

264
00:20:26,758 --> 00:20:28,419
There you are.

265
00:20:29,828 --> 00:20:32,194
Hey, Kat. Hey, Kat.

266
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,859
Oh, hey, yourself. I see you met my ex.

267
00:20:38,103 --> 00:20:40,799
- I was just telling him how we met.
- Mm.

268
00:20:42,874 --> 00:20:44,865
- The Knicks game.
- Oh, yes.

269
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,741
Yeah... Oh.

270
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:48,370
You hate sport.

271
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:50,881
- I hate cricket.
- Right, yes.

272
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:55,413
Well, I should go and... go.

273
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:00,881
He looks miserable.

274
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:05,196
- What were you talking about?
- He seems a little drunk

275
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:08,028
but I think he's still crazy about you.

276
00:21:08,066 --> 00:21:10,534
- Do I know you from somewhere?
- No.

277
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:14,295
What did he say? You don't...

278
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:17,642
You don't think he wants me back?

279
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:21,504
§ Love started making sense

280
00:21:21,546 --> 00:21:25,710
§ I always make mistakes at my expense

281
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:29,619
§ Love has placed a seed

282
00:21:29,655 --> 00:21:33,682
§ And you're the sun

283
00:21:33,725 --> 00:21:37,593
§ Yeah, when we are together

284
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:39,392
§ And when we are apart §

285
00:21:39,431 --> 00:21:41,661
Are you OK?

286
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:46,327
- Here we are.
- Thank God!

287
00:21:46,371 --> 00:21:49,465
- Oh!
- Thanks, Mom.

288
00:21:49,508 --> 00:21:52,272
- There you are, darling.
- Thanks, Dad.

289
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,279
God!

290
00:21:57,883 --> 00:22:02,786
- Thanks again for having me.
- Don't be silly. It's wonderfuI to meet you.

291
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:06,416
Although technically,
I never knew you existed.

292
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:09,791
- Come on, Bunny.
- I love surprises.

293
00:22:10,462 --> 00:22:12,794
Where's Nick sleeping?

294
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:17,427
My mother has this rule about sharing
when there's no ring involved...

295
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:19,903
- Don't be silly.
- What?

296
00:22:19,938 --> 00:22:24,034
I am not as small-town
as my daughter seems to think.

297
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,021
Sorry about this.

298
00:22:43,061 --> 00:22:46,292
I went through a painfully
earnest floraI phase.

299
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:54,862
Air Supply?

300
00:22:58,443 --> 00:23:02,402
Oh. My parents had a German
exchange student a few years back.

301
00:23:03,482 --> 00:23:05,473
He must have left it here.

302
00:23:11,356 --> 00:23:13,256
Everyone knows their greatest hits.

303
00:23:13,291 --> 00:23:16,590
Some of their lesser-known ballads
are surprisingly poignant.

304
00:23:29,341 --> 00:23:34,711
Is that an old habit from ballet class
or from a lifetime of walking on eggshells?

305
00:23:40,685 --> 00:23:42,346
I never took ballet.

306
00:23:50,629 --> 00:23:52,256
How'd you know that was me?

307
00:23:57,469 --> 00:23:59,494
I have a friend at the magazine.

308
00:24:00,505 --> 00:24:02,632
So much for anonymity.

309
00:24:02,674 --> 00:24:05,768
Go ahead, take a look.
It's part of the package.

310
00:24:11,149 --> 00:24:13,674
I'm sorry, I'm just a little nervous.

311
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:17,619
I never thought anything like this
could happen to me.

312
00:24:17,656 --> 00:24:19,647
This happened to you?

313
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:24,721
It happened in the sense that
I picked up the phone, tracked you down,

314
00:24:24,763 --> 00:24:27,755
flew you over her and gave you $6,000.

315
00:24:36,675 --> 00:24:40,372
- Will you grab my shampoo, please?
- Shampoo! Got it.

316
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:49,583
§ I'm all out love,
I'm so lost without you

317
00:24:49,621 --> 00:24:53,955
§ I know you were right,
believing for so long

318
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:59,259
§ I'm all out of love,
what am I without you?

319
00:24:59,297 --> 00:25:05,566
§ I can't be too late
to say that I was so wrong §

320
00:25:09,474 --> 00:25:13,604
The part where you were
a sexuaI surrogate and then started to...

321
00:25:14,746 --> 00:25:16,737
branch out, is...

322
00:25:17,716 --> 00:25:20,412
Is that really how it happened?

323
00:25:20,452 --> 00:25:24,650
The reaI story -
my mother was a hippie, and a stripper.

324
00:25:25,724 --> 00:25:27,919
She was insanely inappropriate with me,

325
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:31,326
she washed her lingerie
in my bath water while I was still in it.

326
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:33,024
Oh.

327
00:25:33,064 --> 00:25:37,057
So as an adult, I needed to find ways
to experience intimacy and sex

328
00:25:37,102 --> 00:25:40,071
- but with rules that couldn't be violated.
- Wow.

329
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:44,301
I'm just screwing with you.

330
00:25:45,744 --> 00:25:47,837
You shit.

331
00:25:49,781 --> 00:25:51,544
OK, this part.

332
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:54,108
You say, and I quote,

333
00:25:54,152 --> 00:25:57,280
"Every woman has
the exact love life she wants. "

334
00:25:57,322 --> 00:25:59,620
That seems a broad generalization... Oh!

335
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:12,230
Oh.

336
00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:18,007
Do you honestly believe that
I want to be single and miserable?

337
00:26:18,043 --> 00:26:22,207
Do you think that I want to be hung up
on some guy who led me on for years

338
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:25,148
and out of the blue shattered my heart?

339
00:26:25,183 --> 00:26:29,244
First of all, there's no such thing
as out of the blue.

340
00:26:29,287 --> 00:26:31,755
And second of all, yeah.

341
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:34,315
- What?
- When you're ready to let go,

342
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:37,157
to be un-single and un-miserable,

343
00:26:37,195 --> 00:26:38,685
you will.

344
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:40,391
Till then...

345
00:26:43,234 --> 00:26:46,169
So when you were talking to Jeffrey before,

346
00:26:46,204 --> 00:26:48,172
how did he sound?

347
00:26:48,206 --> 00:26:51,505
Like a harmless, self-absorbed toolbox.

348
00:26:51,543 --> 00:26:53,636
Seriously.

349
00:26:54,412 --> 00:26:56,607
He sounded tormented.

350
00:27:00,185 --> 00:27:02,176
Tormented? How?

351
00:27:02,654 --> 00:27:04,315
Like he's...

352
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:07,656
jealous that I'm here
with someone else, or like...

353
00:27:09,194 --> 00:27:12,425
he regrets throwing away
our life together?

354
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:24,298
It's just that...

355
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:29,307
this hasn't really turned out
the way that I thought it would.

356
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,685
Hey, Nick.

357
00:27:40,625 --> 00:27:42,286
Oh-oh-oh!

358
00:27:53,238 --> 00:27:55,229
He seems more mature.

359
00:27:56,274 --> 00:27:58,139
Run, you fat tart! Come on.

360
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:06,306
§ Shoo be do be do be do be do wop wop,
shoo be do be do be do be do wop wop §

361
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:08,251
Come on, throw it. Throw it!

362
00:28:09,421 --> 00:28:13,323
§ You'II look at me,
and even though I know... §

363
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:15,519
- Well played, darling.
- Ed!

364
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,027
What?

365
00:28:17,062 --> 00:28:18,256
§ One fine day... §

366
00:28:18,296 --> 00:28:20,662
- Are you ready, TJ?
- Bugger off.

367
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:25,068
§ You're gonna want me for your girI
§ Shoo be do be do be do be do wop wop

368
00:28:25,103 --> 00:28:27,264
§ Oh, yeah §

369
00:28:27,305 --> 00:28:29,296
All right, batter, batter.

370
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:33,401
§ The arms I long for will open wide
§ Shoo be do be do be do be do wop wop

371
00:28:33,445 --> 00:28:36,073
§ And you'll be proud to have me
§ Shoo be do be do be do be do wop wop

372
00:28:36,114 --> 00:28:38,947
§ Right by your side
§ Shoo be do be do be do be do wop wop

373
00:28:38,983 --> 00:28:41,417
§ One fine day

374
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:45,753
§ You're gonna want me for your girI
§ Shoo be do be do be do be do wop wop §

375
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:47,519
- Move back.
- Yeah.

376
00:28:49,994 --> 00:28:53,657
§ Though I know you're the kind of boy... §

377
00:28:53,698 --> 00:28:54,995
Come on, Kat.

378
00:28:55,033 --> 00:28:58,469
- § Who only wants to run around §
- Batter up.

379
00:28:59,604 --> 00:29:01,936
- You're up, Kat.
- § I'll be waiting... §

380
00:29:01,973 --> 00:29:03,600
Go, Kat.

381
00:29:03,641 --> 00:29:07,668
§ Someday, darling, you'll come to me

382
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:11,204
§ When you want to settle down, oh! §

383
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:13,240
Be nice to me, Jeffrey.

384
00:29:13,284 --> 00:29:18,051
§ One fine day, we'll meet once more
§ Shoo be do be do be do be do wop wop §

385
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:19,954
- Out!
- Yes!

386
00:29:22,026 --> 00:29:23,220
§ One fine day... §

387
00:29:23,795 --> 00:29:25,786
Lose the game.

388
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:30,199
§ You're gonna want me for your girI §

389
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:37,435
No!

390
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:41,276
- Come on!
- Edward.

391
00:29:44,082 --> 00:29:45,947
Come on!

392
00:29:45,984 --> 00:29:48,612
Come on, you sexy little monkey. Come on!

393
00:29:51,656 --> 00:29:54,853
- You're supposed to be helping.
- Oh, trust me. I am.

394
00:29:54,893 --> 00:29:57,794
§ One fine day, oh yeah
§ One fine day

395
00:29:57,829 --> 00:30:00,389
§ You're gonna want me for your girI
§ One fine day

396
00:30:00,431 --> 00:30:03,889
§ One fine day
§ Oh yeah

397
00:30:03,935 --> 00:30:05,596
§ One fine day §

398
00:30:23,922 --> 00:30:27,483
What's with the socks?
It's a golf-themed bachelorette.

399
00:30:27,525 --> 00:30:29,720
Have you ever done a wedding before?

400
00:30:29,761 --> 00:30:31,695
No, but I have done funerals.

401
00:30:31,729 --> 00:30:34,323
An escort at a funeraI? Someone's dead.

402
00:30:34,365 --> 00:30:36,663
Yeah, imagine facing that alone.

403
00:30:36,701 --> 00:30:39,033
Ah. Catch.

404
00:30:40,438 --> 00:30:43,236
Make sure he stays on
the right side of the road.

405
00:30:43,274 --> 00:30:45,742
- Which is, of course, the left.
- That's right.

406
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:51,039
So, are you ever attracted
to your clients?

407
00:30:51,649 --> 00:30:56,848
I know you're curious about my business
but I really can't discuss other clients.

408
00:30:56,888 --> 00:31:00,324
Come on! How many of them
want to sleep with you?

409
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:05,390
You know, I swear it's not about the sex.

410
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:08,297
It's about understanding what people need.

411
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:11,564
Please! You're like the Yoda of escorts.

412
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:15,933
Getting you on the phone
was harder than getting into college.

413
00:31:15,974 --> 00:31:19,137
- No, I don't play games. No gimmicks.
- Mm-hm.

414
00:31:19,177 --> 00:31:21,168
It's much more...

415
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:24,241
Subtle?

416
00:31:26,985 --> 00:31:29,545
It's not about me.

417
00:31:29,587 --> 00:31:31,578
It's about you.

418
00:31:32,624 --> 00:31:34,285
Show me.

419
00:31:38,596 --> 00:31:40,257
Come on.

420
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,992
Hmm... What's holding me back?

421
00:31:45,036 --> 00:31:48,301
I think it's the words "morally repugnant".

422
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,601
Show me.

423
00:31:57,348 --> 00:31:59,043
Close your eyes.

424
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:02,045
Close your eyes.

425
00:32:05,823 --> 00:32:09,088
Close your eyes.

426
00:32:15,833 --> 00:32:18,393
You're safe, you can relax.

427
00:32:21,873 --> 00:32:23,864
I'm not gonna kiss you.

428
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:29,602
He's gonna be so sorry he lost you.

429
00:32:31,582 --> 00:32:34,574
So, stop worrying.

430
00:32:36,254 --> 00:32:38,245
Forget the past.

431
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:40,853
Forget the pain.

432
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:43,750
And remember...

433
00:32:46,097 --> 00:32:48,725
what an incredible woman you are.

434
00:32:53,071 --> 00:32:55,232
If you do that,

435
00:32:55,273 --> 00:32:57,207
he'll realize what he lost.

436
00:33:03,781 --> 00:33:06,147
Holy crap!

437
00:33:06,184 --> 00:33:07,845
You're worth every penny.

438
00:33:14,258 --> 00:33:16,249
- You should get going.
- Mm-hm.

439
00:33:18,062 --> 00:33:19,996
OK, Yoda.

440
00:33:35,546 --> 00:33:37,844
To Amy!

441
00:33:39,317 --> 00:33:43,879
§ GirI, to be with you is my favorite thing §

442
00:33:47,492 --> 00:33:49,551
I thought you might need this.

443
00:33:50,395 --> 00:33:52,488
Silly me. Where was my head?

444
00:33:53,231 --> 00:33:55,563
- Bye.
- Listen, why don't you stay

445
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,228
- and have a little fiery drink with us, eh?
- Uh...

446
00:33:58,269 --> 00:34:00,260
- It's fine.
- Come on.

447
00:34:00,304 --> 00:34:02,295
You know you want to!

448
00:34:03,074 --> 00:34:05,838
- Oh, I can see why.
- You're lovely.

449
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:07,708
Isn't he lovely? Have you smelt him?

450
00:34:07,745 --> 00:34:09,736
He smells lovely!

451
00:34:09,781 --> 00:34:12,579
Can you believe Kat gets to shag this guy?

452
00:34:12,617 --> 00:34:17,452
No, really, you should send God
a bottle of wine or a quiche or something.

453
00:34:22,593 --> 00:34:25,756
Look at those buns. Fresh from the bakery.

454
00:34:27,465 --> 00:34:30,662
It must feeI great getting paid
just for being you.

455
00:34:30,701 --> 00:34:33,101
- Who says I'm being me?
- Excuse me.

456
00:34:33,137 --> 00:34:37,540
Amy, thank you for granting me
a rare glimpse into a timeless female rituaI.

457
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:41,170
Here's to the husbands who've won you,
the losers who've lost you

458
00:34:41,212 --> 00:34:44,670
and the lucky bastards
who've yet to meet you.

459
00:34:45,283 --> 00:34:47,979
And to the cock in the henhouse.

460
00:35:18,649 --> 00:35:23,109
I can't believe you found him first.
I am so depressed.

461
00:35:23,154 --> 00:35:26,988
Will somebody buy my hoo-hah a drink?

462
00:35:30,728 --> 00:35:33,993
You remember when we took
the girls hiking in the Lake District?

463
00:35:34,031 --> 00:35:35,430
- No.
- You do!

464
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:38,458
Blistering heat in the morning,
rained all afternoon.

465
00:35:38,503 --> 00:35:39,868
No.

466
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:42,964
You backed your car
over a copper's bicycle.

467
00:35:43,007 --> 00:35:45,635
- Sorry, no.
- The Rat And Gherkin.

468
00:35:45,676 --> 00:35:48,167
- Splendid locaI scrumpy.
- Mm.

469
00:35:48,212 --> 00:35:50,305
Amy wore that little bikini thing.

470
00:35:50,348 --> 00:35:53,283
But somehow it was Kat
that got stung by nettles.

471
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:56,684
Kat never said a word untiI
Amy caught her scratching her arse.

472
00:35:56,721 --> 00:36:01,158
Then you rubbed it with a dock leaf
to bring down the swelling.

473
00:36:02,126 --> 00:36:04,219
Yeah, I remember it.

474
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,923
I didn't deserve her back then.

475
00:36:10,034 --> 00:36:11,729
And you do now?

476
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:20,868
What is his problem?

477
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:25,947
- What?
- There's something about him I don't like.

478
00:36:25,983 --> 00:36:29,316
He's less than 90 per cent body fat
and he's shagging your ex.

479
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:31,378
No, that is not it. Look at him,

480
00:36:31,422 --> 00:36:35,358
he's walking around all American,
like he owns the place.

481
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:45,601
Oh, no!

482
00:36:46,938 --> 00:36:49,202
Come on, this is your last chance.

483
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,891
Woody?

484
00:37:14,932 --> 00:37:18,800
- Not yet, but it's getting there!
- It's getting there!

485
00:37:21,138 --> 00:37:24,107
Oh, my God! What are you doing here?

486
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:29,645
I thought you were in San Francisco,
or was it NepaI?

487
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:33,138
Close. Sydney.
But it turns out that I missed the rain.

488
00:37:33,184 --> 00:37:37,712
Did Kat tell you that she dumped you because
of your funky breath?

489
00:37:38,889 --> 00:37:40,550
She's drunk.

490
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:44,459
But I didn't... I didn't really dump you. Right?

491
00:37:45,396 --> 00:37:50,732
Hard. But it was understandable,
you were one of the hottest girls in schooI.

492
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:54,602
And we know that Kat was
one of the hottest expats in schooI

493
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:58,632
because she was voted
Best Eyes and Brightest Smile

494
00:37:58,676 --> 00:38:01,474
and the Most Likely To Age Well.

495
00:38:06,217 --> 00:38:09,118
You're my half-sister but I whole love you.

496
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:19,125
How about you get
my half-sister a Seventh Hole?

497
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:22,489
- Tequila. Tequila.
- Sure.

498
00:38:31,742 --> 00:38:34,506
Are you all right?

499
00:38:34,545 --> 00:38:36,775
I don't know if I can do this.

500
00:38:38,249 --> 00:38:40,149
The Seventh Hole?

501
00:38:40,184 --> 00:38:42,618
No! The wedding.

502
00:38:43,888 --> 00:38:46,789
I shouldn't be allowed to get married.
I shouldn't.

503
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:49,485
What are you talking about?

504
00:38:53,197 --> 00:38:54,892
TJ!

505
00:38:58,235 --> 00:39:00,362
Come on! Come on!

506
00:39:06,143 --> 00:39:10,102
What's wrong with Jeffrey?
As if I would sleep with a stripper!

507
00:39:10,147 --> 00:39:13,048
I'm about to get married. You have to...

508
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:20,721
It's been my experience that
a man in love doesn't want a prostitute.

509
00:39:22,426 --> 00:39:24,587
Eddie, you did the right thing.

510
00:39:33,637 --> 00:39:37,073
How do you know so much...

511
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:41,771
about so much?

512
00:39:44,315 --> 00:39:46,306
I'm a hooker.

513
00:39:57,762 --> 00:39:59,855
I like that.

514
00:40:05,369 --> 00:40:06,836

530
00:40:53,984 --> 00:40:56,714
- Ladies...
- How much do you rock, TJ?

531
00:40:56,754 --> 00:40:59,450
.. that was a top night.

532
00:41:00,524 --> 00:41:02,355
Top night!

533
00:41:17,741 --> 00:41:19,834

00:41:31,088 --> 00:41:33,147

00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:35,454

00:42:49,366 --> 00:42:51,163
Ooh! Ow!

- Morning.
- Morning.

563
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:37,890
Ahoy, there!

564
00:45:42,106 --> 00:45:43,767
Hi, Dad.

565
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:17,130
I don't know what works for you
but I brought you some black coffee

566
00:46:17,174 --> 00:46:21,008
and some stale crackers, egg and cheese
sandwich and a Bloody Mary.

567
00:46:21,044 --> 00:46:24,946
That's very sweet of you.
But I need to ask you something.

568
00:46:28,919 --> 00:46:30,978
What happened last night?

569
00:46:36,226 --> 00:46:37,887
Nothing.

570
00:46:54,278 --> 00:46:56,109
Thanks.

571
00:47:11,862 --> 00:47:15,354
- Is this for last night?
- No! How could it be? Nothing happened.

572
00:47:15,399 --> 00:47:18,800
If I was gonna charge you,
I said I'd tell you first.

573
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:24,069
I didn't want you to think that
I was expecting anything for free

574
00:47:24,107 --> 00:47:26,974
or that I was expecting anything at all.

575
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:29,638
I mean, obviously
I was expecting something

576
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:33,047
or else I wouldn't have stopped at that ATM.

577
00:47:33,083 --> 00:47:35,415
Just so you know, you're 300 short.

578
00:47:40,123 --> 00:47:44,059
Wait, you're telling me that
if something happened last night,

579
00:47:44,094 --> 00:47:45,686
I'd have to pay you $1,700?

580
00:47:45,729 --> 00:47:47,993
That's a down payment on a Ford Focus.

581
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:49,828
Not dollars, pounds.

582
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:52,734
Besides, it includes, you know...

583
00:47:52,769 --> 00:47:54,862
That's the extra 300.

584
00:47:58,141 --> 00:48:00,473
Are you a boatsman, son?

585
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:03,138
I am now, sir.

586
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:06,013
I'm glad someone's
making use of her at last.

587
00:48:06,049 --> 00:48:08,210
The boat, I mean.

588
00:48:09,686 --> 00:48:12,018
"To defile. " Four letters.

589
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:14,046
- Good morning, Daddy.
- Ah.

590
00:48:17,461 --> 00:48:22,023
- What if I didn't want you to do that to me?
- The 300's for you doing it to me.

591
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:25,933
If anything had happened, it would have
been one of the highlights, for you.

592
00:48:25,969 --> 00:48:29,905
- But nothing did.
- That's why you get to keep your money.

593
00:48:30,707 --> 00:48:32,470
The wedding dance is

594
00:48:32,509 --> 00:48:36,969
the most important dance moment
in a person's life.

595
00:48:38,282 --> 00:48:41,274
A room full of friends and family,

596
00:48:41,952 --> 00:48:44,512
watching, smiling,

597
00:48:44,554 --> 00:48:47,216
betting on how long the marriage will last.

598
00:48:48,258 --> 00:48:51,056
All you'll have is each other

599
00:48:51,094 --> 00:48:54,086
and whatever skills you acquire today.

600
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:57,594
And pair off.

601
00:49:03,407 --> 00:49:07,241
- § When marimba rhythms start to play... § -
Breathe. Good, that's a nice position.

602
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:09,802
Now, your left foot. Her right foot.

603
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:13,674
Good. And we'll try to glide across the floor.

604
00:49:14,151 --> 00:49:17,587
Come a little bit closer together. Moving.

605
00:49:18,255 --> 00:49:20,621
Trying to turn.

606
00:49:20,657 --> 00:49:22,989
What's the matter, Nick?

607
00:49:23,026 --> 00:49:24,823
Two left feet?

608
00:49:26,196 --> 00:49:27,788
Oh!

609
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:33,365
§ Stay with me, sway with me

610
00:49:34,137 --> 00:49:37,834

§ When we dance you have a way with me §

625
00:50:33,296 --> 00:50:36,322
When I told you
I'd never done a wedding before,

626
00:50:36,366 --> 00:50:39,392
it wasn't because I'd never been asked.

627
00:50:41,204 --> 00:50:43,195
I'd just never said yes.

628
00:50:45,108 --> 00:50:46,769
Why'd you say yes to me?

629
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:51,840
There was something in your voice
on the phone that day.

630
00:50:54,184 --> 00:50:56,175
Desperation?

631
00:50:57,788 --> 00:50:59,722
I think it was hope.

632
00:50:59,756 --> 00:51:03,123
Get a move on, you lovebirds.
I'm getting married in the morning.

633
00:51:32,055 --> 00:51:35,889
- Ah, hello, Bambi.
- Darling, please don't do that.

634
00:51:42,899 --> 00:51:44,890
Oh, wow.

635
00:51:46,436 --> 00:51:48,427
That's a big bed.

636
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:06,318
You know what pisses me off?

637
00:52:06,356 --> 00:52:11,419
I've been spilling my guts all weekend
and I don't know anything about you.

638
00:52:12,762 --> 00:52:15,026
I'm allergic to fabric softener.

639
00:52:15,899 --> 00:52:20,302
I'm majoring in comparative literature
at Brown. I hate anchovies.

640
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:25,131
I think I'd miss you
even if we'd never met.

641
00:52:32,616 --> 00:52:34,550
Come on!

642
00:52:39,890 --> 00:52:43,553
I'm a little concerned...
I'm just... It makes me nervous...

643
00:52:43,593 --> 00:52:47,085
You know, I might just call you.

644
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:51,927
But if I did, I would lose,
because my hand is complete shite.

645
00:52:51,968 --> 00:52:53,435
Ohhh.

646
00:52:55,505 --> 00:52:56,904
- I'm in.
- Come on.

647
00:52:56,940 --> 00:52:59,238
There's gotta be something wrong with him.

648
00:52:59,276 --> 00:53:02,677
I bet his thingy bends, doesn't it?
Got a little kink in it.

649
00:53:02,712 --> 00:53:05,806
Oh, no, don't tell me.
It's bloody perfect.

650
00:53:06,583 --> 00:53:09,211
I'm going to see you.

651
00:53:11,154 --> 00:53:13,452
Looky, looky here.

652
00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:15,958
A full house.

653
00:53:15,992 --> 00:53:18,119
Oh-ho-ho!

654
00:53:18,161 --> 00:53:22,154
Has anyone seen my future wife?
She'll kill me if I don't serve her first.

655
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:25,691
Have you guys ever had
a reaI honest-to-God fight, ever?

656
00:53:25,735 --> 00:53:28,260
- Yes, of course.
- Yeah, right.

657
00:53:28,305 --> 00:53:32,401
Well, apparently,
makeup sex is the best kind.

658
00:53:32,442 --> 00:53:34,433
Not that I'm ever going to find out.

659
00:53:34,477 --> 00:53:37,139
Give me that!

660
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:39,341
- Come on!
- No, no!

661
00:53:39,382 --> 00:53:41,373
- Don't!
- Come on!

662
00:53:46,089 --> 00:53:48,785
You seem to have a way with women.

663
00:53:49,492 --> 00:53:52,928
Why don't you go and rustle up the bride? Get
her to join the party.

664
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:00,492
Why are you bringing this up now?
I love Ed.

665
00:54:00,537 --> 00:54:03,665
- What do you want from me?
- I want you to tell me...

666
00:54:07,644 --> 00:54:11,307
Blue shirt or... white shirt
for the, er, rehearsaI dinner?

667
00:54:16,853 --> 00:54:18,514
Sorry to interrupt.

668
00:54:19,756 --> 00:54:22,224
Your dad sent me.

669
00:54:22,259 --> 00:54:24,250
What for?

670
00:54:25,195 --> 00:54:27,356
To make sure you're OK.

671
00:54:32,869 --> 00:54:35,531
Kat, could I have a word?
It'll only take a moment.

672
00:54:35,572 --> 00:54:39,975
Let me think. You stole seven years of
her life with your bullshit and your charm

673
00:54:40,010 --> 00:54:41,910
and now you'd like just a moment?

674
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:44,505
Sure. Go right ahead.

675
00:54:48,818 --> 00:54:52,879
Thanks for the solidarity, Mum,
but next time a little less information.

676
00:54:54,491 --> 00:54:56,925
Do you believe a place has a memory?

677
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:02,865
Even before Ed and I started dating,
we all used to come up here in the summer

678
00:55:02,899 --> 00:55:04,890
and spend weekends.

679
00:55:14,210 --> 00:55:16,974
God, I hope it doesn't remember everything.

680
00:55:18,948 --> 00:55:21,678
No matter how certain
one is of one's position

681
00:55:21,718 --> 00:55:23,913
of what one should or shouldn't do,

682
00:55:23,953 --> 00:55:26,114
one sometimes discovers

683
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:30,855
that one is not as one would have
hoped one would have been.

684
00:55:31,394 --> 00:55:34,886
- What exactly are you trying to say?
- I'm sorry.

685
00:55:34,931 --> 00:55:38,526
Look, I feeI like I need to tell you something.

686
00:55:38,568 --> 00:55:42,129
- You're not even listening.
- I'm sorry. I'll be back in a minute.

687
00:55:49,045 --> 00:55:52,173
Hey, is everything OK?

688
00:55:55,652 --> 00:55:57,643
Yeah.

689
00:55:59,856 --> 00:56:01,483
Yeah.

690
00:56:06,830 --> 00:56:08,821
Anchovy, Nick?

691
00:56:08,865 --> 00:56:11,026
I remember the day I met Kat.

692
00:56:11,067 --> 00:56:13,058
It was in New York.

693
00:56:13,103 --> 00:56:15,264
I'd been seeing Bunny for a few months

694
00:56:15,305 --> 00:56:20,004
and she finally trusted me
enough to meet her kid.

695
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:26,278
So I'm over at her place
and in walks this little monster.

696
00:56:27,817 --> 00:56:30,149
That was it. I was a goner.

697
00:56:31,354 --> 00:56:33,345
That was the day I became a dad.

698
00:56:34,657 --> 00:56:38,991
You know, Nick, you think it's going
to get easier as they get older,

699
00:56:39,028 --> 00:56:42,020
that you're going to worry about them less.

700
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:46,862
Or that you're going to trust the world more.

701
00:56:47,704 --> 00:56:49,865
But that's just not how it happens.

702
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:04,879
This may not make much sense to you, sir,

703
00:57:04,921 --> 00:57:08,755
but I'd like to ask your permission
to date your daughter.

704
00:57:11,327 --> 00:57:13,318
I thought you already were.

705
00:57:28,711 --> 00:57:34,081
- I blame... I blame Tony Peepants.
- No.

706
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:35,914
Let's have the story. Kat, come on.

707
00:57:35,952 --> 00:57:39,683
- No.
- I have to initiate Nick into our family.

708
00:57:39,722 --> 00:57:45,592
I blame Tony for why my two girls
just don't seem to be able to get along.

709
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:49,826
Don't deny it. You barely tolerate each other.

710
00:57:49,866 --> 00:57:54,235
Come on. It's true. The only thing you've got in
common is you're both attracted to me.

711
00:57:54,270 --> 00:57:56,067
It started after we moved here.

712
00:57:56,105 --> 00:58:01,065
My two girls got into a fight over Tony
Peepants and have never made up since.

713
00:58:01,110 --> 00:58:03,442
Apparently, Kat and I were inseparable.

714
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:06,074
If Kat ate a banana, Amy threw it up.

715
00:58:06,115 --> 00:58:08,174
If Amy threw it up, Kat ate it.

716
00:58:09,552 --> 00:58:14,251
So we were eating
and throwing up together in harmony

717
00:58:14,290 --> 00:58:16,758
untiI Tony walked me home
from schooI one day.

718
00:58:16,793 --> 00:58:18,192
He was my first boyfriend.

719
00:58:18,228 --> 00:58:21,220
Tony ignored Kat
because he wanted to play with me.

720
00:58:21,264 --> 00:58:25,462
Anyway, the point of the story is that
Tony ended up with a chair in his face.

721
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:28,630
It was plastic and child-sized.

722
00:58:29,639 --> 00:58:35,100
- As I recall, there were stitches involved.
- Come on, Bunny, 15 stitches.

723
00:58:35,144 --> 00:58:37,612
So is that when he peed in his pants?

724
00:58:37,647 --> 00:58:40,081
He cried a lot,
but there was no peeing.

725
00:58:40,116 --> 00:58:43,313
So what's with the nickname?

726
00:58:47,357 --> 00:58:49,655
I have absolutely no idea.

727
00:58:52,595 --> 00:58:54,586
Let me get some more wine.

728
00:58:55,532 --> 00:58:57,762
Would you marry me if I asked?

729
00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:00,098
That was a yes. Did you see that?

730
00:59:11,047 --> 00:59:15,245
And you know, I thought perhaps you...
Bollocks. Sorry.

731
00:59:15,985 --> 00:59:20,820
I had no idea this would be so difficult.
I just feeI like I owe you an explanation.

732
00:59:20,857 --> 00:59:23,291
Relax, relax. It's fine.

733
00:59:24,227 --> 00:59:26,218
I promise.

734
00:59:28,665 --> 00:59:33,068
And I should probably admit that...

735
00:59:35,004 --> 00:59:38,906
I brought Nick with me to torture you, slowly,

736
00:59:38,942 --> 00:59:40,933
for the entire weekend.

737
00:59:41,778 --> 00:59:46,181
But then, I don't know,
something happened and now...

738
00:59:46,215 --> 00:59:50,948
I hope this doesn't hurt your feelings
but I'm just sick of you and me.

739
00:59:51,788 --> 00:59:57,556
Of our whole story, so come on,
let's just go upstairs and eat some tiramisu.

740
01:00:01,130 --> 01:00:03,496
I slept with your sister.

741
01:00:13,242 --> 01:00:17,804
- I'm sorry?
- Well, I shagged Amy, two years ago.

742
01:00:17,847 --> 01:00:20,680
That's why I broke it off with you.

743
01:00:20,717 --> 01:00:26,087
And then after you left,
sod it, we kept at it like rabbits,

744
01:00:26,122 --> 01:00:31,253
untiI we both realized it was absolutely mad
and, obviously, morally wrong.

745
01:00:33,696 --> 01:00:36,665
And then that was it.

746
01:00:36,699 --> 01:00:42,103
But last Christmas, when Ed proposed,

747
01:00:42,138 --> 01:00:45,904
I realized... I'm in love with her.

748
01:00:51,848 --> 01:00:54,339
Good Lord, say something, please.

749
01:01:10,433 --> 01:01:12,867
Oh, my God, he's told you, hasn't he?

750
01:01:13,703 --> 01:01:17,195
- You knew?
- Kat, I'm so sorry. I'm so...

751
01:01:27,250 --> 01:01:29,718
Kat. Kat, please.

752
01:01:29,752 --> 01:01:32,050
Kat, please don't say anything.

753
01:01:36,626 --> 01:01:38,321
I can't believe you told her.

754
01:02:10,693 --> 01:02:12,888
What's going on?

755
01:02:12,929 --> 01:02:14,920
Nothing.

756
01:02:16,699 --> 01:02:18,462
It doesn't look like nothing.

757
01:02:19,502 --> 01:02:22,027
Now is not the time to catch on, Ed.

758
01:02:24,373 --> 01:02:27,274
OK. Good.

759
01:02:40,256 --> 01:02:43,282
Leave me alone.
You knew and you didn't tell me.

760
01:02:43,326 --> 01:02:46,818
- Wait up.
- I can't believe I trusted you.

761
01:02:46,863 --> 01:02:48,990
Come on. You've got to stop running.

762
01:02:49,031 --> 01:02:52,728
- How could you not have told me?
- What did you expect me to say?

763
01:02:53,536 --> 01:02:56,096
You let me make a fooI of myself.

764
01:02:56,139 --> 01:03:00,974
You lied to me, but I guess I shouldn't be
surprised because that's what you do.

765
01:03:01,010 --> 01:03:03,137
That's who you are. You're a liar.

766
01:03:04,247 --> 01:03:06,841
You're judging me? That's a good one.

767
01:03:06,883 --> 01:03:09,374
You're going to point a finger at me,

768
01:03:09,418 --> 01:03:13,411
the guy that you hired
to pretend to be your boyfriend?

769
01:03:13,456 --> 01:03:18,052
You're right. I was so desperate
to make everyone believe that I was happy

770
01:03:18,094 --> 01:03:20,790
that I paid $6,000 for a lie.

771
01:03:20,830 --> 01:03:25,529
And, at the end of the day, the only one
who ended up falling for it was me.

772
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:28,562
I wish I could say it was worth it.

773
01:03:30,173 --> 01:03:32,767
Go ahead, Kat, hate me.

774
01:03:33,609 --> 01:03:37,705
I think you're running out of steam
on this whole Jeffrey thing anyhow.

775
01:03:37,747 --> 01:03:42,878
Maybe now you'll be able to hold on to this
long enough to ruin your next relationship.

776
01:03:56,899 --> 01:04:00,391
- Nick.
- I'm just checking into a hoteI.

777
01:04:00,436 --> 01:04:02,961
Don't be ridiculous. It's late.

778
01:04:03,973 --> 01:04:05,964
Take the car.

779
01:04:12,949 --> 01:04:16,112
Actually, the boathouse is empty.

780
01:04:17,386 --> 01:04:21,880
Look, I don't know what's going on with
you two but I'm sure you'll work it out.

781
01:04:25,928 --> 01:04:30,922
You couldn't be more perfect
if she'd picked you out of a catalog.

782
01:04:36,038 --> 01:04:38,029
Thanks, Ed.

783
01:04:48,284 --> 01:04:49,945
Hey.

784
01:04:53,289 --> 01:04:54,847
Hey.

785
01:04:58,127 --> 01:05:03,963
I just... I wanted to say thank you
for not outing me in front of Ed.

786
01:05:06,802 --> 01:05:11,205
I want to tell him,
just not the night before our wedding.

787
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:14,573
You know, with these things,
timing is everything.

788
01:05:23,753 --> 01:05:25,744
You're right.

789
01:05:26,756 --> 01:05:28,451
You should time it right,

790
01:05:28,991 --> 01:05:33,621
so that when he hears that
you repeatedly screwed his best friend,

791
01:05:33,663 --> 01:05:37,121
he won't feeI like the world is collapsing
and there's no escape

792
01:05:37,166 --> 01:05:40,363
because you tricked him into marrying you.

793
01:05:47,576 --> 01:05:50,704
- Kat...
- Don't worry. Your wedding will be perfect.

794
01:05:50,746 --> 01:05:55,843
Tomorrow I'll say all the right things
and you'll deaI with Ed when you're ready.

795
01:05:55,885 --> 01:06:00,584
But right now, tonight,
I'm not going to pretend it's OK.

796
01:06:14,670 --> 01:06:17,138
And that's your first flight out?

797
01:06:17,173 --> 01:06:19,334
§ Another summer day
has come and gone away §

798
01:06:19,375 --> 01:06:22,037
- All right, thanks.
- § In Paris and Rome

799
01:06:22,078 --> 01:06:23,739
§ I wanna go home

800
01:06:26,716 --> 01:06:29,844
§ Mmm

801
01:06:30,953 --> 01:06:34,946
§ Another aeroplane, another sunny place

802
01:06:34,991 --> 01:06:36,982
§ I'm lucky, I know

803
01:06:37,026 --> 01:06:39,290
§ But I wanna go home

804
01:06:40,696 --> 01:06:43,256
§ Mm, I've got to go home

805
01:06:45,368 --> 01:06:47,393
§ And I feeI just like I'm living... §

806
01:06:47,436 --> 01:06:50,769
- I'm OK.
- § Someone else's life

807
01:06:52,141 --> 01:06:54,006
§ It's like I just stepped outside... §

808
01:06:54,043 --> 01:06:56,034
I don't believe you.

809
01:06:56,946 --> 01:06:59,107
I'm fine, really.

810
01:07:01,517 --> 01:07:05,749
Nothing a bottle of Jack
and a straight razor couldn't fix.

811
01:07:09,859 --> 01:07:11,850
Anyway, it doesn't matter.

812
01:07:11,894 --> 01:07:13,953
It's Amy's day.

813
01:07:31,614 --> 01:07:33,605
Get in the car, darling.

814
01:07:42,725 --> 01:07:44,716
No, no. Smile.

815
01:08:10,052 --> 01:08:11,883
Hello.

816
01:08:14,723 --> 01:08:16,714
I've been looking for you.

817
01:08:21,664 --> 01:08:24,258
So, why did you let him go?

818
01:08:30,306 --> 01:08:32,900
- It's complicated, Dad.
- Right.

819
01:08:32,942 --> 01:08:35,877
It probably wouldn't have
worked out anyway, huh?

820
01:08:40,850 --> 01:08:45,549
I remember reading a fascinating article
in the New York Times Magazine once,

821
01:08:45,588 --> 01:08:48,056
where this guy said,

822
01:08:48,090 --> 01:08:52,789
"Every woman has
the exact love life she wants. "

823
01:08:54,296 --> 01:08:56,890
You know what? I agree with him.

824
01:08:58,167 --> 01:09:01,659
But I refuse to believe
that this is what you want, Kat.

825
01:09:02,638 --> 01:09:05,038
Ever since you were little,

826
01:09:05,074 --> 01:09:08,566
you've always worried
about what other people think.

827
01:09:09,612 --> 01:09:14,447
Now, come on. What do you think?
Is he the guy for you?

828
01:09:21,524 --> 01:09:23,014
Then go and get him.

829
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:54,912
Hello, darling. Your mother said
you wanted to have a quick word.

830
01:09:54,957 --> 01:09:56,948
No, no, no, I...

831
01:10:01,530 --> 01:10:05,022
There's something
you should know before you marry me.

832
01:10:05,067 --> 01:10:06,295
What is it?

833
01:10:57,086 --> 01:11:00,112
I wanted to tell you
but I was afraid you'd never forgive me

834
01:11:00,155 --> 01:11:02,487
and I just... I love you so much.

835
01:11:03,325 --> 01:11:05,555
I'm sorry.

836
01:11:05,594 --> 01:11:11,829
I knew you were seeing someone else
when we finally got together, but not Jeffrey.

837
01:11:13,902 --> 01:11:16,302
Does Kat know?

838
01:11:17,673 --> 01:11:19,641
Jeffrey told her last night.

839
01:11:25,147 --> 01:11:26,978
Excuse me.

840
01:11:34,990 --> 01:11:36,651
Ed?

841
01:11:41,030 --> 01:11:44,022
Ed... Calm down, Ed.

842
01:11:44,066 --> 01:11:45,465
Ed!

843
01:11:47,736 --> 01:11:48,998
TJ!

844
01:11:55,044 --> 01:11:57,012
Ah!

845
01:12:01,116 --> 01:12:05,212
Ed, calm down!
It's all sorted! She wants you!

846
01:12:05,254 --> 01:12:07,882
I've given up! What's the problem?

847
01:12:07,923 --> 01:12:10,084
You back-stabbing weaseI!

848
01:12:10,125 --> 01:12:13,891
That's not fair.
It was before you guys were even dating.

849
01:12:13,929 --> 01:12:17,194
But you were engaged to her sister.

850
01:12:17,232 --> 01:12:19,928
Ed, calm down!

851
01:12:21,036 --> 01:12:24,563
We can talk about this
like civilized human beings.

852
01:12:31,714 --> 01:12:34,182
I look like a totaI wanker, don't I?

853
01:12:34,216 --> 01:12:35,808
Yeah, kind of.

854
01:12:41,890 --> 01:12:46,293
Get in the car, Ed.
He's halfway to France by now.

855
01:12:47,563 --> 01:12:48,552
Whoa!

856
01:12:58,040 --> 01:13:01,908
I trust you've enjoyed
your trip to England.

857
01:13:01,944 --> 01:13:04,606
Yeah, it was fantastic.
Thanks, Eddie.

858
01:13:07,383 --> 01:13:10,250
You know, I felt sorry
for you last night.

859
01:13:11,253 --> 01:13:16,213
I was just sitting there like some smug arse,
thinking, "Aren't I a lucky sod?"

860
01:13:18,127 --> 01:13:23,588
I forgave her when I thought
it was just some random bloke.

861
01:13:25,667 --> 01:13:27,658
But not Jeffrey.

862
01:13:31,006 --> 01:13:33,668
I've had her up on a pedestaI ever since...

863
01:13:37,813 --> 01:13:40,111
ever since I put her up there.

864
01:13:41,950 --> 01:13:44,111
What a mess I've made, huh?

865
01:13:56,365 --> 01:13:58,356
I'm so sorry.

866
01:14:05,407 --> 01:14:07,568
The hardest thing's loving someone

867
01:14:07,609 --> 01:14:10,840
and then having the courage
to let them love you back.

868
01:14:18,220 --> 01:14:20,484
But if you know her shit
and she knows yours

869
01:14:20,522 --> 01:14:24,925
and at the end of the day,
you still would rather give up than try...

870
01:14:28,497 --> 01:14:30,931
nothing's ever gonna be worth it.

871
01:14:37,339 --> 01:14:40,172
Maybe think about it this way.

872
01:14:40,209 --> 01:14:42,803
You go back,

873
01:14:42,845 --> 01:14:46,508
you get to spend the rest of your life
having really great makeup sex.

874
01:14:50,853 --> 01:14:53,014
- Ed?
- Must run!

875
01:14:54,223 --> 01:14:55,952
Hi.

876
01:14:58,160 --> 01:14:59,821
Hi.

877
01:15:02,064 --> 01:15:06,694
Last night, when we were fighting,
I thought this was over.

878
01:15:08,904 --> 01:15:13,967
And I was going to leave you alone
and just take off but...

879
01:15:16,278 --> 01:15:22,877
Then I realized I'd rather fight with you
than make love with anyone else.

880
01:15:53,782 --> 01:15:56,774
- I should get going.
- What? No, you can't.

881
01:15:56,818 --> 01:15:58,809
I have to.

882
01:15:58,854 --> 01:16:00,685
I'm the best man.

883

Ed, there's no one in the world who knows

899
01:17:25,574 --> 01:17:28,372
how to love my baby sister better than you.

900
01:17:28,844 --> 01:17:30,539
Be good to one another.
