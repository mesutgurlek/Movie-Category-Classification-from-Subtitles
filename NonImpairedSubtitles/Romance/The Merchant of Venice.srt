1
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,080
(Man) Usurer!

2
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:11,460
Usurer!

3
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:34,820
"If a man is righteous,
and does what is lawful and right,

4
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,780
"if he has not exacted usury
nor taken any increase

5
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:42,219
"but has withdrawn his hand
from all iniquity

6
00:02:42,219 --> 00:02:46,389
"and executed true judgment
between men and men,

7
00:02:46,389 --> 00:02:48,889
"if he has walked in my statutes

8
00:02:48,999 --> 00:02:54,109
"and kept my judgment faithfully,
then he is just and he shall surely live.

9
00:02:54,939 --> 00:02:58,489
"But if he has exacted usury
and taken increase,

10
00:02:58,589 --> 00:03:00,359
"shall he then live?

11
00:03:00,469 --> 00:03:04,739
"No, he shall not live. If he has
done any of these abominations..."

12
00:03:09,539 --> 00:03:13,079
(Preacher) And yet you live
by theft and robbery...

13
00:03:13,189 --> 00:03:15,169
Antonio.

14
00:04:37,018 --> 00:04:38,268
Antonio.

15
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:39,938
Bassanio.

16
00:04:49,328 --> 00:04:52,978
- (Man) Wind's coming back, sir.

17
00:05:05,488 --> 00:05:07,157
(Man) Signior Lorenzo.

18
00:06:27,656 --> 00:06:29,216
Jessica.

19
00:06:41,316 --> 00:06:44,436
(Antonio) In truth,
I know not why I am so sad.

20
00:06:45,796 --> 00:06:49,656
It wearies me. You say it wearies you.

21
00:06:51,736 --> 00:06:56,116
And such a want-wit sadness makes of me
that I have much ado than know myself.

22
00:06:56,226 --> 00:06:58,936
Your mind is tossing on the ocean.

23
00:06:58,936 --> 00:07:02,686
Believe me, sir, had I such venture forth,

24
00:07:02,796 --> 00:07:07,066
the better part of my affection
would be with my hopes abroad.

25
00:07:08,426 --> 00:07:12,276
I should be still plucking the grass
to know where sits the wind,

26
00:07:12,386 --> 00:07:15,516
peering in maps
for ports and piers and roads.

27
00:07:15,616 --> 00:07:20,096
And every object that might make me fear
misfortune to my ventures

28
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:22,396
out of doubt would make me sad.

29
00:07:22,496 --> 00:07:25,106
My wind, cooling my broth,

30
00:07:25,206 --> 00:07:29,176
would blow me to a fever if I thought what
harm a wind too great might do at sea.

31
00:07:29,176 --> 00:07:32,296
Believe me, no.

32
00:07:32,406 --> 00:07:35,635
- Why, then you're in love.

33
00:07:36,475 --> 00:07:38,345
Fie, fie, fie!

34
00:07:42,725 --> 00:07:45,125
Not in love either?

35
00:07:45,225 --> 00:07:47,415
Then let us say you are sad

36
00:07:47,525 --> 00:07:49,925
because you are not merry.

37
00:07:50,025 --> 00:07:52,115
Here comes my lord Bassanio.

38
00:07:57,325 --> 00:08:01,495
- Good morrow, my good lord.
- Good signiors. When shall we laugh?

39
00:08:01,595 --> 00:08:05,045
We shall make our leisures
to fit in with yours.

40
00:08:06,605 --> 00:08:08,795
- Bassanio.
- Signior.

41
00:08:08,895 --> 00:08:10,355
(Whispers)

42
00:08:10,465 --> 00:08:14,215
My lord Bassanio, since you have found
Antonio, we too will leave you.

43
00:08:16,515 --> 00:08:19,325
You look not well, Signior Antonio.

44
00:08:21,415 --> 00:08:24,335
You have too much respect
upon the world.

45
00:08:25,165 --> 00:08:27,775
They lose it that do buy it with much care.

46
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:31,425
I hold the world but
as the world, Gratiano -

47
00:08:31,525 --> 00:08:37,995
A stage where every man
must play his part, and mine a sad one.

48
00:08:45,085 --> 00:08:47,274
Come, good Lorenzo.

49
00:08:47,374 --> 00:08:50,714
Fare thee well awhile.
I'll end my exhortation after dinner.

50
00:08:51,754 --> 00:08:53,634
Fare thee well.

51
00:08:54,674 --> 00:08:57,384
Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing,

52
00:08:57,384 --> 00:08:59,674
more than any man in all of Venice.

53
00:09:04,474 --> 00:09:05,934
Well?

54
00:09:22,514 --> 00:09:24,394
Tell me now...

55
00:09:28,664 --> 00:09:32,624
that which today
you promised to tell me of.

56
00:09:39,924 --> 00:09:45,454
'Tis not unknown to you, Antonio,
how much I have disabled mine estate,

57
00:09:45,554 --> 00:09:49,314
but my chief care is to come
squarely out of the great debts

58
00:09:49,414 --> 00:09:55,464
wherein my youth, something too prodigal,

59
00:09:56,294 --> 00:09:58,593
has left me pledged.

60
00:09:58,693 --> 00:10:04,643
To you, Antonio,
I owe the most in money and in love,

61
00:10:04,743 --> 00:10:09,853
and from your love I have a warranty
to unburden all my plots and purposes

62
00:10:09,953 --> 00:10:13,603
how to get clear of all the debts I owe.

63
00:10:14,853 --> 00:10:17,363
Pray, good Bassanio, let me know it.

64
00:10:19,863 --> 00:10:29,353
And, if it stand, as you yourself still do,
within the eye of honour,

65
00:10:29,453 --> 00:10:35,083
be assured my purse, my person,
my extremest means

66
00:10:35,193 --> 00:10:37,593
lie all unlocked to your occasion.

67
00:10:41,243 --> 00:10:44,263
In Belmont is a lady richly left -

68
00:10:44,993 --> 00:10:50,623
And she is fair, and fairer than that word -

69
00:10:51,773 --> 00:10:54,483
Of wondrous virtues.

70
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:59,383
Sometimes, from her eyes
I did receive fair...

71
00:11:00,423 --> 00:11:02,093
speechless messages.

72
00:11:04,383 --> 00:11:08,973
Her name is Portia, no less a beauty
than Cato's daughter, Brutus' Portia.

73
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:12,202
Nor is the wide world
ignorant of her worth,

74
00:11:12,312 --> 00:11:16,482
for the four winds blow in from every coast
renowned suitors.

75
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:21,802
O my Antonio,

76
00:11:22,632 --> 00:11:27,742
had I but the means
to hold a rival place with one of them

77
00:11:29,932 --> 00:11:33,682
then I should questionless be fortunate.

78
00:11:36,922 --> 00:11:39,632
Thou knowest my fortunes are at sea.

79
00:11:45,782 --> 00:11:50,892
Neither have I money nor commodity
to raise a present sum.

80
00:11:58,812 --> 00:12:01,212
Therefore, go forth.

81
00:12:01,322 --> 00:12:04,972
Try what my credit can in Venice do.

82
00:12:09,242 --> 00:12:14,042
It shall be racked, even to the uttermost,
to furnish you to Belmont,

83
00:12:15,502 --> 00:12:17,172
and fair Portia.

84
00:12:27,071 --> 00:12:28,951
(Birdsong)

85
00:12:34,471 --> 00:12:37,291
I swear to you, Nerissa,

86
00:12:37,391 --> 00:12:41,461
- I am more weary of this great world.
- You would be, sweet madam,

87
00:12:41,571 --> 00:12:45,941
if your miseries were as plentiful
as your good fortunes are.

88
00:12:46,051 --> 00:12:48,131
And yet, from what I see,

89
00:12:48,241 --> 00:12:52,721
they are as sick that have it in excess
as those that starve with nothing.

90
00:12:52,831 --> 00:12:56,161
If doing were as easy
as knowing what were good to do,

91
00:12:56,271 --> 00:12:58,351
chapels had been churches,

92
00:12:58,461 --> 00:13:01,381
and poor men's cottages princes' palaces.

93
00:13:02,841 --> 00:13:07,531
(Sighs) But this reasoning is
not in the way to choose me a husband.

94
00:13:07,631 --> 00:13:10,031
O me, the word "choose"!

95
00:13:10,141 --> 00:13:13,991
I may neither choose who I would
nor refuse who I dislike.

96
00:13:14,101 --> 00:13:18,271
So is the will of a living daughter
ruled by a dead father.

97
00:13:22,751 --> 00:13:28,381
Is it not hard, Nerissa,
that I cannot choose one nor refuse none?

98
00:13:30,361 --> 00:13:33,491
Your father was always virtuous,

99
00:13:33,601 --> 00:13:38,710
and holy men, at their death,
have good inspirations.

100
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,420
Therefore the lottery, that he devised

101
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,750
in these three chests
of gold and silver and lead,

102
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:47,360
so that who chooses his meaning
chooses you,

103
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:52,890
will no doubt only be guessed, rightly,
by someone who you shall rightly love.

104
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:55,390
Right.

105
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:58,620
(Nerissa) What warmth is there
in your affection

106
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:01,960
towards any of these princely suitors
that are already come?

107
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:05,300
(Portia) Pray name them, and
as you name them I will describe them,

108
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:09,050
and, according
to my description, level at my affection.

109
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:13,010
How say you of the French lord,
Monsieur Le Bon?

110
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,310
Oh, God.

111
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:18,750
God made him,
and therefore let him pass for a man.

112
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:21,460
I know it is a sin to be a mocker, but he...!

113
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,790
What say you to Falconbridge,
the young baron of England?

114
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:28,970
(Portia laughs) How oddly he's suited!

115
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:31,360
And the Duke of Saxony's nephew?

116
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:36,890
Very vilely in the morning
when he is sober,

117
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:40,020
and most vilely in the afternoon
when he is drunk.

118
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,790
O Nerissa!

119
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:43,770
- Wait! Wait.

120
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:47,630
If he should offer to choose,
and choose the right casket,

121
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:53,359
you should refuse to perform your father's
will if you should refuse to accept him.

122
00:14:53,469 --> 00:14:56,389
Therefore, for fear of the worst, I pray thee,

123
00:14:56,489 --> 00:15:00,139
set a deep glass of Rhenish wine
on the contrary casket.

124
00:15:00,249 --> 00:15:05,149
I will do anything, Nerissa,
ere I will be married to a sponge.

125
00:15:14,949 --> 00:15:17,239
(Bleating)

126
00:15:18,809 --> 00:15:22,039
(Shylock) Three thousand ducats.

127
00:15:22,139 --> 00:15:23,809
Well.

128
00:15:23,809 --> 00:15:26,419
Ay, sir, for three months.

129
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:28,919
For three months?

130
00:15:31,629 --> 00:15:33,929
- Well...
- For which, as I told you,

131
00:15:34,029 --> 00:15:36,009
Antonio shall be bound.

132
00:15:36,119 --> 00:15:38,199
Antonio shall be bound?

133
00:15:41,429 --> 00:15:43,619
Well...

134
00:15:43,729 --> 00:15:46,229
May you help me? Will you pleasure me?

135
00:15:47,689 --> 00:15:49,779
Should I know your answer?

136
00:15:51,129 --> 00:15:54,679
Three thousand ducats for three months,

137
00:15:54,679 --> 00:15:57,069
and Antonio bound.

138
00:15:57,179 --> 00:15:59,159
Your answer to that.

139
00:15:59,989 --> 00:16:02,079
Antonio is a good man.

140
00:16:02,908 --> 00:16:05,938
Have you heard any imputation
to the contrary?

141
00:16:06,038 --> 00:16:10,418
No. No, no, no, no. My meaning
in saying that he is a good man

142
00:16:10,528 --> 00:16:15,638
is to have you understand
that he is of good credit.

143
00:16:15,738 --> 00:16:17,818
Yet his means are in question.

144
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:23,868
He hath a ship bound for Tripolis,
another to the Indies.

145
00:16:23,868 --> 00:16:28,458
I understand moreover, upon the Rialto,
he hath a third ship at Mexico,

146
00:16:28,558 --> 00:16:30,548
a fourth for England,

147
00:16:31,798 --> 00:16:35,028
and other ventures
he hath squandered abroad.

148
00:16:36,388 --> 00:16:39,298
But ships are but boards,

149
00:16:39,408 --> 00:16:42,018
sailors are but men,

150
00:16:42,018 --> 00:16:44,728
there be land rats and water rats,

151
00:16:44,828 --> 00:16:47,538
water thieves and land thieves.

152
00:16:49,518 --> 00:16:51,608
I mean pirates.

153
00:16:52,858 --> 00:16:56,408
Then there is the peril of waters,
winds and rocks.

154
00:16:56,508 --> 00:17:00,468
The man is, notwithstanding,
of good credit.

155
00:17:02,238 --> 00:17:04,018
Three thousand ducats.

156
00:17:05,478 --> 00:17:07,558
I think I may take his bond.

157
00:17:09,438 --> 00:17:12,668
- Be assured you may.
- May I speak with Antonio?

158
00:17:12,778 --> 00:17:14,968
If it please you, dine with us.

159
00:17:15,068 --> 00:17:17,157
Yes, to smell pork,

160
00:17:17,257 --> 00:17:21,737
to eat of the habitation which your prophet
the Nazarite conjured the devil into.

161
00:17:23,517 --> 00:17:29,037
I will buy with you, sell with you, walk
with you, talk with you, and so following,

162
00:17:29,147 --> 00:17:31,857
but I will not eat with you,
nor drink with you,

163
00:17:31,957 --> 00:17:33,937
nor pray with you.

164
00:17:34,047 --> 00:17:36,127
Who is he comes here?

165
00:17:36,237 --> 00:17:38,107
This is Signior Antonio. Antonio!

166
00:17:38,947 --> 00:17:40,827
(Bassanio) Antonio.

167
00:17:43,947 --> 00:17:47,187
How like a fawning publican he looks.

168
00:17:48,117 --> 00:17:50,417
Shylock! Shylock, do you hear?

169
00:17:51,357 --> 00:17:54,487
I am debating of my present store,

170
00:17:54,587 --> 00:17:59,177
and by the near guess of my memory,
I cannot instantly raise up the gross

171
00:17:59,177 --> 00:18:01,367
of full three thousand ducats.

172
00:18:01,467 --> 00:18:07,207
But Tubal, a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe,
will furnish me.

173
00:18:07,307 --> 00:18:10,537
Benjamin. Go, seek out Tubal.

174
00:18:11,787 --> 00:18:14,187
But soft, how many months?

175
00:18:14,297 --> 00:18:17,317
Rest you fair, good signior.

176
00:18:17,317 --> 00:18:21,177
Your worship was the last man
in our mouths.

177
00:18:21,907 --> 00:18:27,017
- Is he possessed how much you would?
- Ay, ay, three thousand ducats.

178
00:18:27,117 --> 00:18:29,096
And for three months.

179
00:18:29,206 --> 00:18:32,126
Ah, I forgot. Three months, you told me so.

180
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:39,736
But soft, erm... methought you said
you neither lend nor borrow with interest.

181
00:18:40,986 --> 00:18:44,426
- I do never use it.
- Well.

182
00:18:44,536 --> 00:18:47,656
Three thousand ducats,
'tis a good round sum.

183
00:18:59,646 --> 00:19:01,316
- (Door shuts)
- Launcelot.

184
00:19:02,366 --> 00:19:04,446
The rates.

185
00:19:10,286 --> 00:19:13,306
Three months... from twelve.

186
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:16,756
Let me see the rate.

187
00:19:31,146 --> 00:19:33,226
Well, Shylock,

188
00:19:34,896 --> 00:19:36,876
shall we be beholden to you?

189
00:19:40,106 --> 00:19:42,295
Signior Antonio...

190
00:19:43,445 --> 00:19:46,885
many a time, and oft in the Rialto,

191
00:19:46,985 --> 00:19:51,475
you have reviled me
about my moneys and my usances.

192
00:19:51,575 --> 00:19:56,165
Still, I have borne it with a patient shrug,

193
00:19:56,265 --> 00:19:59,295
for sufferance is the badge of all our tribe.

194
00:20:00,645 --> 00:20:02,425
You call me misbeliever,

195
00:20:03,365 --> 00:20:05,345
cut-throat dog,

196
00:20:05,445 --> 00:20:09,095
and spit upon my Jewish gaberdine.

197
00:20:09,195 --> 00:20:12,955
And all for use of that which is my own.

198
00:20:13,055 --> 00:20:19,005
Well, it now appears you need my help.

199
00:20:19,105 --> 00:20:24,945
You come to me and you say,
"Shylock, we would have money."

200
00:20:24,945 --> 00:20:30,365
You say so. You, that did void
your rheum upon my beard

201
00:20:30,475 --> 00:20:35,375
and kick me as you spurn a stranger cur
over your threshold.

202
00:20:35,475 --> 00:20:38,495
Money is your suit.
What should I say to you?

203
00:20:40,165 --> 00:20:43,715
Should I not say, "Hath a dog money?

204
00:20:45,065 --> 00:20:50,075
"Is it possible a cur can lend
three thousand ducats?"

205
00:20:50,175 --> 00:20:52,155
Or shall I bend low

206
00:20:52,265 --> 00:20:57,164
and, in a slavish voice, with bated breath
and whispering humbleness say this -

207
00:20:57,264 --> 00:21:00,504
"Fair sir, you spat on me
on Wednesday last,

208
00:21:00,604 --> 00:21:04,464
"you spurned me such a day,
another time you called me dog.

209
00:21:04,564 --> 00:21:07,804
"For these courtesies,
I'll lend you thus much moneys."

210
00:21:07,904 --> 00:21:11,864
(Antonio) I'm as like to call you so again,
to spit on you again, to spurn you too.

211
00:21:11,974 --> 00:21:15,094
If you would lend this money,
lend it not unto your friends.

212
00:21:15,204 --> 00:21:18,954
For when did friendship take
a breed for barren metal from his friends?

213
00:21:19,064 --> 00:21:21,454
Lend it rather to your enemy who,
if he break,

214
00:21:21,454 --> 00:21:23,754
you may with better face exact the penalty.

215
00:21:23,854 --> 00:21:28,024
Why, look how you storm.
I would be friends with you

216
00:21:28,134 --> 00:21:30,634
and have your love.

217
00:21:30,734 --> 00:21:36,054
Forget the stains
that you have shamed me with.

218
00:21:36,894 --> 00:21:43,874
Supply your present wants, and take not
a drop of interest for my moneys...

219
00:21:43,984 --> 00:21:46,584
...and you'll not hear me.

220
00:21:46,694 --> 00:21:49,194
- (Laughs)
- This is kind I offer.

221
00:21:51,174 --> 00:21:53,994
- This is kindness.
- No...

222
00:21:54,094 --> 00:21:57,434
This kindness I will show.

223
00:22:00,354 --> 00:22:03,684
Go with me to a notary

224
00:22:03,794 --> 00:22:07,333
and seal me there your single bond.

225
00:22:07,333 --> 00:22:09,733
And in a merry sport,

226
00:22:09,843 --> 00:22:13,073
if you repay me not on such a day

227
00:22:13,173 --> 00:22:17,663
in such a place, such a sum or sums
as are expressed in the condition,

228
00:22:17,763 --> 00:22:21,413
let the forfeit be nominated...

229
00:22:21,523 --> 00:22:26,003
for an equal pound of your fair flesh

230
00:22:27,563 --> 00:22:32,053
to be cut off and taken

231
00:22:32,153 --> 00:22:35,903
in what part of your body pleaseth me.

232
00:22:42,583 --> 00:22:44,563
(Chuckles)

233
00:22:47,793 --> 00:22:50,093
Content, i'faith.

234
00:22:51,553 --> 00:22:53,743
I'll seal to such a bond,

235
00:22:53,843 --> 00:22:56,863
and say there is much kindness in the Jew.

236
00:22:57,703 --> 00:23:02,913
You shall not seal such a bond for me.
I'd rather live in my necessity.

237
00:23:03,023 --> 00:23:05,213
(Antonio) Why, fear not, man.

238
00:23:05,313 --> 00:23:07,403
I will not forfeit it.

239
00:23:07,503 --> 00:23:11,043
Within these two months,
that's a month before this bond expires,

240
00:23:11,153 --> 00:23:15,323
I do expect return of thrice three times
the value of this bond.

241
00:23:16,263 --> 00:23:19,183
O father Abraham,
what these Christians are,

242
00:23:19,283 --> 00:23:23,452
whose own hard dealings teaches them
suspect the thoughts of others.

243
00:23:23,562 --> 00:23:26,892
I pray you, tell me this.

244
00:23:27,002 --> 00:23:32,422
If he should break his day, what should
I gain by the exaction of the forfeiture?

245
00:23:32,522 --> 00:23:37,222
A pound of a man's flesh taken from a man
is not so estimable,

246
00:23:37,322 --> 00:23:38,992
profitable neither,

247
00:23:39,092 --> 00:23:42,122
as flesh of muttons, beefs, or goats.

248
00:23:44,202 --> 00:23:50,252
I say, to buy his favour,
I extend this friendship.

249
00:23:50,362 --> 00:23:53,382
If he will take it, so. If not, adieu.

250
00:23:53,482 --> 00:23:56,722
And, for my love, I pray you, wrong me not.

251
00:24:00,572 --> 00:24:02,352
Shylock...

252
00:24:03,392 --> 00:24:05,372
I will seal unto this bond.

253
00:24:09,542 --> 00:24:12,152
(Sizzling)

254
00:24:21,322 --> 00:24:23,932
Dislike me not for my complexion,

255
00:24:24,032 --> 00:24:29,252
the shadowed livery of the burnished sun,
to whom I am a neighbour and near bred.

256
00:24:30,812 --> 00:24:33,211
Yallah! Yallah!

257
00:24:33,321 --> 00:24:35,921
Bring me the fairest creature
northward born,

258
00:24:36,031 --> 00:24:39,261
where the sun's fire
scarce thaws the icicles,

259
00:24:39,361 --> 00:24:42,071
and let us make incision for your love

260
00:24:42,071 --> 00:24:46,041
to prove whose blood is reddest,
his or mine.

261
00:24:46,141 --> 00:24:48,021
I tell thee,

262
00:24:48,121 --> 00:24:52,711
lady, this aspect of mine
hath feared the valiant.

263
00:24:52,811 --> 00:24:58,341
Yea, by my love I swear, the most regarded
virgins of our clime have loved it too.

264
00:24:58,441 --> 00:25:00,841
(Men laughing)

265
00:25:00,951 --> 00:25:06,061
I would not change this hue, except
to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.

266
00:25:08,561 --> 00:25:13,671
In terms of choice, I am not solely led
by nice direction of a maiden's eyes.

267
00:25:13,771 --> 00:25:18,671
Instead, the lottery of my destiny bars me
the right of voluntary choosing.

268
00:25:18,781 --> 00:25:22,431
But if my father had not restrained me,

269
00:25:23,261 --> 00:25:26,291
and hedged me by his wit
to yield myself as wife

270
00:25:26,391 --> 00:25:28,891
to him who wins me
by that means I told you,

271
00:25:30,461 --> 00:25:33,791
yourself, renowned prince,

272
00:25:33,901 --> 00:25:38,801
then stood as fair as... any comer
I have looked on yet for my affection.

273
00:25:38,901 --> 00:25:42,241
- (Laughter)
- Even for that, I thank you.

274
00:25:42,971 --> 00:25:46,410
Therefore, I pray you, lead me
to the caskets to try my fortune.

275
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:48,080
(Morocco) Yes?

276
00:25:55,790 --> 00:26:00,800
(Men talking in Italian)

277
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:07,470
(Bassanio) I pray you, Leonardo, these
things being bought and orderly bestowed,

278
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:12,580
return in haste, for I do feast tonight
my best esteemed acquaintance.

279
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:17,480
Let supper be ready
at the latest by nine o'clock.

280
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:22,070
See that these letters are delivered.

281
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:26,140
And put the livery to the making.

282
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:40,840
Certainly my conscience would forbid me
to run from this Jew, my master.

283
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,510
(Man) Ho!

284
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:48,760
I pray you, which way to the master Jew's?

285
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:51,680
Do you not know me, Father?

286
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:53,980
Lord, how art thou changed!

287
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:59,709
How dost thou and thy master agree?
I brought him a present.

288
00:27:02,739 --> 00:27:06,389
Famished in his service, Father.
I'm glad you've come.

289
00:27:06,389 --> 00:27:10,239
Give your present to one master Bassanio,

290
00:27:10,349 --> 00:27:14,619
- who indeed gives rare new liveries.
- (Thunder rumbling)

291
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:21,709
(Man) Si.

292
00:27:23,069 --> 00:27:24,739
Bassanio!

293
00:27:26,089 --> 00:27:27,869
Bassanio!

294
00:27:28,699 --> 00:27:31,309
- Gratiano.
- I have a suit to you.

295
00:27:31,409 --> 00:27:34,749
- You have obtained it.
- You must not deny me -

296
00:27:34,749 --> 00:27:37,039
I must go with you to Belmont.

297
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:43,509
Why, then you must. But hear thee, you are
too wild, too rude, too bold of voice,

298
00:27:43,509 --> 00:27:49,029
things that become you happily enough
and in such eyes as ours appears not false.

299
00:27:49,139 --> 00:27:55,599
But where you are not known, why,
there they show something too... liberal.

300
00:27:55,709 --> 00:28:01,749
Pray you, take pain to dilute with some
cold drops of modesty your skipping spirit,

301
00:28:01,859 --> 00:28:06,449
lest through your wild behaviour
I be misconstrued in the place I go

302
00:28:06,549 --> 00:28:08,529
and lose my hopes.

303
00:28:08,639 --> 00:28:11,239
Signior Bassanio, hear me.

304
00:28:12,698 --> 00:28:17,918
If I do not put on a sober habit, talk with
respect, and swear but now and then,

305
00:28:18,018 --> 00:28:21,248
look demurely,
nay more, while grace is saying,

306
00:28:21,358 --> 00:28:24,588
hood mine eyes thus with my hat

307
00:28:24,688 --> 00:28:27,818
and sigh and say, "Amen,"
never trust me more.

308
00:28:27,928 --> 00:28:30,848
Well, we shall see your bearing.

309
00:28:33,348 --> 00:28:35,428
(Bassanio) Oof!

310
00:28:37,308 --> 00:28:39,398
Nay, but I bar tonight.

311
00:28:40,338 --> 00:28:43,148
You shall not gauge me
by what we do tonight.

312
00:28:43,248 --> 00:28:44,918
(Bassanio laughs)

313
00:28:48,678 --> 00:28:51,178
God bless your worship.

314
00:28:51,278 --> 00:28:52,948
Signior Bassanio.

315
00:28:53,058 --> 00:28:54,828
Many thanks.

316
00:28:54,928 --> 00:28:57,228
Would you something from me?

317
00:28:58,368 --> 00:29:02,128
- Here is my son, sir, a poor boy.
- Not a poor boy, sir,

318
00:29:02,228 --> 00:29:04,838
but the rich Jew's man that would, sir,

319
00:29:05,988 --> 00:29:07,968
as my father shall specify.

320
00:29:08,068 --> 00:29:12,028
He hath a great infection, sir,
as one would say, to serve.

321
00:29:12,138 --> 00:29:14,018
Indeed, sir. The short and the long is,

322
00:29:14,118 --> 00:29:18,598
I serve the Jew, and have a desire,
as my father shall specify.

323
00:29:24,028 --> 00:29:29,967
To be brief, the very truth is, as my father,
being an old man, shall fruitify unto you...

324
00:29:30,067 --> 00:29:33,617
I have here a dish of doves
I would bestow upon your worship.

325
00:29:33,717 --> 00:29:35,077
(Gobbo) And my suit is...

326
00:29:35,177 --> 00:29:38,617
(Launcelot) In very brief,
the suit is impertinent to myself,

327
00:29:38,727 --> 00:29:41,327
as your worship shall know
by this honest old man.

328
00:29:41,437 --> 00:29:45,507
And, though I say it, though old man,
yet poor man, my father.

329
00:29:46,437 --> 00:29:48,837
One speak for both. What would you?

330
00:29:52,487 --> 00:29:56,247
- Serve you, sir.
- That is the very defect of the matter, sir.

331
00:29:56,347 --> 00:29:58,537
You have obtained your suit,

332
00:29:58,637 --> 00:30:01,877
if it be preferment
to leave a rich Jew's service

333
00:30:01,977 --> 00:30:04,477
to become the follower
of so poor a gentleman.

334
00:30:04,587 --> 00:30:09,167
The old proverb is very well parted
between my master Shylock and you, sir.

335
00:30:09,277 --> 00:30:12,717
You have the grace of God, sir,
and he has enough.

336
00:30:12,817 --> 00:30:14,487
(Laughs)

337
00:30:15,327 --> 00:30:19,907
You speak it well. Give him a livery more
guarded than his fellows'. See it done.

338
00:30:34,407 --> 00:30:36,697
(Thunder)

339
00:30:52,856 --> 00:30:55,466
I'm sorry you will leave my father so.

340
00:30:55,576 --> 00:31:00,366
Our house is hell, and you, a merry devil,
did rob it of some taste of tediousness.

341
00:31:03,396 --> 00:31:07,566
And Launcelot, soon at supper
shall you see Lorenzo,

342
00:31:07,666 --> 00:31:09,966
who is thy new master's guest.

343
00:31:10,066 --> 00:31:12,046
Give him this letter.

344
00:31:12,986 --> 00:31:14,966
Do it secretly.

345
00:31:17,366 --> 00:31:19,246
And so farewell.

346
00:31:19,346 --> 00:31:22,896
I would not have my father
see me talk with thee.

347
00:31:26,226 --> 00:31:28,206
Adieu. (Clears throat)

348
00:31:29,776 --> 00:31:35,716
Tears exhibit my tongue.
Most beautiful pagan, most sweet Jew.

349
00:31:41,866 --> 00:31:48,226
O Lorenzo, if thou keep promise,
I shall end this strife,

350
00:31:48,336 --> 00:31:51,255
becoming Christian and your loving wife.

351
00:31:55,215 --> 00:31:56,885
Jessica?

352
00:32:05,435 --> 00:32:07,105
Well.

353
00:32:08,665 --> 00:32:13,045
You will see, your eyes will be the judge,

354
00:32:13,145 --> 00:32:16,175
the difference of old Shylock and Bassanio.

355
00:32:17,945 --> 00:32:22,535
You will not gourmandise with him,
as you have done with me,

356
00:32:22,635 --> 00:32:26,285
nor sleep and snore and wear apparel out.

357
00:32:27,125 --> 00:32:28,895
Not with him.

358
00:32:28,995 --> 00:32:32,025
- Jessica, I say!
- Why, Jessica.

359
00:32:32,125 --> 00:32:34,105
Who bids you call?

360
00:32:35,465 --> 00:32:38,175
I do not bid you call.

361
00:32:38,275 --> 00:32:42,445
Your worship was used to say
I could do nothing without bidding.

362
00:32:42,555 --> 00:32:44,635
- Oh.
- (Door opens)

363
00:32:44,635 --> 00:32:46,515
Call you?

364
00:32:48,185 --> 00:32:51,525
- What's your will?
- I am bid forth to supper, Jessica.

365
00:32:51,625 --> 00:32:53,605
There are my keys.

366
00:32:56,945 --> 00:32:58,925
Wherefore should I go?

367
00:33:00,695 --> 00:33:02,785
I am not bid for love.

368
00:33:07,164 --> 00:33:09,144
Oh, they flatter me.

369
00:33:11,024 --> 00:33:14,564
Yet I will go and feed
upon the prodigal Christian.

370
00:33:16,654 --> 00:33:20,304
Jessica, my girl, look to my house.

371
00:33:25,514 --> 00:33:28,224
Oh, I am right loath to go.

372
00:33:30,104 --> 00:33:34,484
There is some ill a-brewing
towards my rest,

373
00:33:36,464 --> 00:33:41,984
for I did dream of money bags tonight.

374
00:33:41,984 --> 00:33:44,804
I beseech you, sir, go.

375
00:33:44,904 --> 00:33:46,994
My young master expects your reproach.

376
00:33:48,454 --> 00:33:50,434
And so do I his.

377
00:33:53,354 --> 00:33:55,854
And they have conspired together.

378
00:33:56,584 --> 00:33:58,774
I will not say you shall see a masque,

379
00:33:58,884 --> 00:34:02,534
but if you do, it was not for nothing
that my nose fell a-bleeding

380
00:34:02,634 --> 00:34:06,074
on Black Monday last
at six o'clock in the morning.

381
00:34:06,184 --> 00:34:08,474
What, are there masques?

382
00:34:10,664 --> 00:34:13,474
Hear you me, Jessica,

383
00:34:13,584 --> 00:34:17,023
clamber not you up to the casements then,

384
00:34:17,123 --> 00:34:19,943
nor thrust your head into the public street

385
00:34:20,043 --> 00:34:23,803
to gaze on Christian fools
with varnished faces.

386
00:34:25,993 --> 00:34:30,163
Let not the sound of shallow foppery
enter my sober house.

387
00:34:32,873 --> 00:34:37,773
Oh, by Jacob's staff, I swear I have
no mind of feasting forth tonight.

388
00:34:40,903 --> 00:34:43,403
But I will go.

389
00:34:43,503 --> 00:34:48,093
Go you before, sirrah. Say I will come.

390
00:34:48,203 --> 00:34:50,183
I will go before, sir.

391
00:34:52,473 --> 00:34:55,393
Mistress, look out the window for all this.

392
00:34:55,503 --> 00:34:59,253
There will come a Christian boy
will be worth a Jewess' eye.

393
00:35:01,443 --> 00:35:06,133
What says that fool
of Hagar's offspring, ha?

394
00:35:08,953 --> 00:35:13,333
His words were, "Farewell, mistress."
Nothing else.

395
00:35:14,793 --> 00:35:17,393
(Sighs) The fool is kind enough

396
00:35:17,503 --> 00:35:19,693
but a huge feeder.

397
00:35:19,793 --> 00:35:23,963
Snail-slow in profit,
and he sleeps by day more than a tomcat.

398
00:35:25,213 --> 00:35:28,243
Therefore, I part with him.

399
00:35:34,912 --> 00:35:40,962
Well, Jessica, go in.
Perhaps I will return immediately.

400
00:35:43,772 --> 00:35:45,862
Do as I bid you.

401
00:36:02,542 --> 00:36:07,862
Farewell.
And if my fortune be not crost,

402
00:36:07,962 --> 00:36:10,682
I have a father, you a daughter, lost.

403
00:36:21,002 --> 00:36:23,292
How do I know if I do choose the right?

404
00:36:23,402 --> 00:36:26,112
The one of them
contains my picture, Prince.

405
00:36:26,112 --> 00:36:29,032
If you choose that, then I am yours withal.

406
00:36:29,132 --> 00:36:31,632
Some god direct my judgment!

407
00:36:34,872 --> 00:36:37,272
(Speaks in native tongue)

408
00:36:38,202 --> 00:36:40,082
Let me see.

409
00:36:41,332 --> 00:36:46,131
"Who chooseth me
must give and hazard all he hath."

410
00:36:47,381 --> 00:36:51,131
- Hmm...
- Must give? For what?

411
00:36:51,131 --> 00:36:53,741
For lead? Hazard for lead?

412
00:36:55,621 --> 00:36:58,641
This casket, my friends, threatens.

413
00:36:58,751 --> 00:37:03,231
Men who hazard all
do it in hope of fair advantages.

414
00:37:03,851 --> 00:37:07,091
A golden mind stoops not
to shows of dross, eh?

415
00:37:07,191 --> 00:37:09,691
(All laugh)

416
00:37:09,801 --> 00:37:13,131
I'll then nor give nor hazard
aught for lead, ah? Mm-mm.

417
00:37:17,831 --> 00:37:22,211
What says the silver with her virgin hue?

418
00:37:23,041 --> 00:37:25,331
"Who chooseth me...

419
00:37:25,441 --> 00:37:28,571
"shall gain as much as he deserves."

420
00:37:30,551 --> 00:37:32,741
Pause there, Morocco,

421
00:37:33,991 --> 00:37:37,851
and weigh thy value
with an even hand, ha?

422
00:37:37,951 --> 00:37:41,291
I do in birth deserve her, and in fortunes,

423
00:37:41,391 --> 00:37:44,521
and in graces, and in qualities of breeding!

424
00:37:48,481 --> 00:37:51,301
What if I stray no further but choose here?

425
00:37:56,090 --> 00:37:57,450
Hmm...

426
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:02,560
"Who chooseth me...

427
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:05,370
"will gain what many men...

428
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:08,920
"desire."

429
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:11,420
Hmm...
- Huh?

430
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:13,400
Why, that's the lady!

431
00:38:13,510 --> 00:38:16,220
All of the world desires her!

432
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:20,390
From the four corners of the earth,
they come to kiss this shrine,

433
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:22,680
this mortal-breathing saint.

434
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:29,670
Deliver me the key.
Here do I choose, and thrive as I may.

435
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:32,590
There, take it, Prince.

436
00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:36,240
And if my form lie there, I am yours.

437
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,930
Ha!

438
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:04,810
O hell.

439
00:39:07,519 --> 00:39:09,499
What have we here?

440
00:39:18,989 --> 00:39:21,489
"All that glistens is not gold.

441
00:39:22,639 --> 00:39:25,039
"Often have you heard that told.

442
00:39:25,139 --> 00:39:27,849
"Gilded tombs do worms enfold.

443
00:39:29,109 --> 00:39:31,819
"Fare you well...

444
00:39:31,919 --> 00:39:35,669
- "but your suit is cold."

445
00:39:49,329 --> 00:39:52,979
For all of my fortune, Shylock,
I give thanks.

446
00:39:53,089 --> 00:39:55,589
To best-esteemed acquaintances.

447
00:39:56,529 --> 00:39:58,609
Antonio, good health.

448
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:04,039
I know the hand. In faith, it is a fair hand,

449
00:40:04,139 --> 00:40:07,689
and whiter than the paper it writ on
is the fair hand that writ.

450
00:40:07,789 --> 00:40:09,249
Love-news, in faith.

451
00:40:13,629 --> 00:40:15,819
Meet me tonight.

452
00:40:48,248 --> 00:40:52,628
This is the penthouse under which
Lorenzo desired us to make stand?

453
00:40:54,708 --> 00:40:56,798
His hour is almost past.

454
00:40:56,898 --> 00:41:01,588
And it is a marvel he outstays his hour
for lovers always run before the clock.

455
00:41:01,588 --> 00:41:03,678
That ever holds.

456
00:41:03,778 --> 00:41:07,748
Who rises from a feast with
that keen appetite that he sits down?

457
00:41:09,618 --> 00:41:13,268
Sweet friends,
your patience for my long delay.

458
00:41:14,628 --> 00:41:17,028
Ho! Who's within?

459
00:41:18,898 --> 00:41:20,878
Who are you?

460
00:41:20,988 --> 00:41:25,158
Tell me for more certainty,
albeit I swear that I do know your tongue.

461
00:41:25,258 --> 00:41:27,558
Lorenzo and thy love.

462
00:41:27,658 --> 00:41:30,578
Lorenzo, certain, and my love indeed,

463
00:41:30,688 --> 00:41:33,397
for who I love so much?

464
00:41:33,497 --> 00:41:36,727
And now who knows but you, Lorenzo,
whether I am yours?

465
00:41:36,837 --> 00:41:39,757
Heaven and thy thoughts are witness
that thou art.

466
00:41:42,047 --> 00:41:44,757
Here! Catch this casket.

467
00:41:44,867 --> 00:41:47,157
(All) No!

468
00:41:47,267 --> 00:41:48,927
It is worth the pains.

469
00:42:01,857 --> 00:42:08,017
I'm glad 'tis night. You do not look on me
for I am much ashamed of my disguise.

470
00:42:08,117 --> 00:42:13,747
But love is blind and lovers cannot see
the pretty follies that themselves commit.

471
00:42:15,417 --> 00:42:17,817
For if they could,
Cupid himself would blush

472
00:42:17,917 --> 00:42:20,527
to see me thus transformed into a boy.

473
00:42:27,097 --> 00:42:30,227
Descend, for you must be my torchbearer.

474
00:42:30,327 --> 00:42:35,327
Why, 'tis an office of discovery, love,
and I should be obscured.

475
00:42:35,437 --> 00:42:40,337
So are you, sweet,
even in the lovely garnish of a boy.

476
00:42:40,437 --> 00:42:43,887
But come at once,
for the close night doth play the runaway.

477
00:42:48,056 --> 00:42:52,016
I will gild myself with some more ducats
and be with you straight.

478
00:43:14,226 --> 00:43:18,286
Contend me, but I love her, heartily.

479
00:43:18,396 --> 00:43:22,986
For she is wise, if I can judge of her,

480
00:43:22,986 --> 00:43:26,006
and fair, she is, if that mine eyes be true

481
00:43:26,116 --> 00:43:28,826
and true she is, as she hath proved herself.

482
00:43:28,826 --> 00:43:32,886
And therefore, like herself,
wise, fair and true,

483
00:43:32,996 --> 00:43:35,496
shall she be placed in my constant soul.

484
00:43:35,596 --> 00:43:36,956
(All) No!

485
00:43:37,056 --> 00:43:39,766
(Thunder)

486
00:43:41,546 --> 00:43:43,526
(Antonio) Who's there?

487
00:43:45,086 --> 00:43:48,846
- Signior Antonio!
- Fie, fie, Gratiano.

488
00:43:48,946 --> 00:43:51,866
'Tis ten o'clock, our friends all wait for you.

489
00:43:51,966 --> 00:43:54,156
No masque tonight.

490
00:43:54,266 --> 00:43:57,606
The wind has come about,
Bassanio soon will come aboard.

491
00:43:57,706 --> 00:44:00,835
I have sent twenty out to seek for you.

492
00:44:16,475 --> 00:44:18,455
Jessica!

493
00:44:20,335 --> 00:44:21,995
Jessica!

494
00:44:27,735 --> 00:44:29,195
Jessica!

495
00:44:30,865 --> 00:44:32,845
I will make some speed of my return.

496
00:44:32,945 --> 00:44:36,285
Hurry not business for my sake,
but stay the very riping of the time.

497
00:44:36,385 --> 00:44:40,975
And for the Jew's bond that he has
of thee, let it not enter your mind of love.

498
00:44:41,085 --> 00:44:43,065
- Leva i remi.
- Rema.

499
00:44:43,065 --> 00:44:45,355
Avanti!

500
00:44:45,355 --> 00:44:49,215
Be merry and employ
your chiefest thoughts to courtship,

501
00:44:49,315 --> 00:44:53,695
such fair displays of love
as may conveniently become you there.

502
00:44:53,805 --> 00:44:56,615
Tira!

503
00:44:56,615 --> 00:45:01,515
Oh... ehi! Oh... ehi!

504
00:45:01,625 --> 00:45:06,415
Oh... ehi! Oh... ehi!

505
00:45:10,175 --> 00:45:11,844
No!

506
00:45:14,444 --> 00:45:15,904
No!

507
00:45:18,094 --> 00:45:20,184
No, no. (Sobs)

508
00:45:23,104 --> 00:45:25,714
Jessica!

509
00:45:25,814 --> 00:45:27,894
(Sobs)

510
00:45:27,894 --> 00:45:29,984
No.

511
00:45:38,324 --> 00:45:40,824
I never heard
a passion so confused,

512
00:45:40,934 --> 00:45:43,744
so strange, outrageous and so variable

513
00:45:43,744 --> 00:45:47,194
as the dog Jew did utter in the streets.

514
00:45:47,294 --> 00:45:51,774
"My daughter! O my ducats!
O my daughter!"

515
00:45:54,804 --> 00:45:57,304
The villain Jew with outcries
raised the Duke

516
00:45:57,404 --> 00:46:00,014
who went with him
to search Bassanio's ship.

517
00:46:00,114 --> 00:46:03,144
He came too late, the ship was under sail.

518
00:46:03,144 --> 00:46:08,674
Let good Antonio look he keep his day
or he shall pay for this.

519
00:46:10,024 --> 00:46:12,114
Marry, well remembered.

520
00:46:13,984 --> 00:46:16,284
I reasoned with a Frenchman yesterday

521
00:46:17,324 --> 00:46:21,184
who told me, in the narrow seas
that part the French and English

522
00:46:21,284 --> 00:46:24,723
there miscarried a vessel of our country
richly fraught.

523
00:46:24,833 --> 00:46:30,153
I thought upon Antonio when he told me
and wished in silence that it were not his.

524
00:46:32,133 --> 00:46:34,423
Madam! Madam!

525
00:46:34,843 --> 00:46:36,713
Madam!

526
00:46:38,383 --> 00:46:40,783
Oh... Madam!

527
00:46:41,823 --> 00:46:44,223
Quick! Quick!

528
00:46:45,063 --> 00:46:47,873
I pray you, the Prince of Aragon
hath taken his oath

529
00:46:47,983 --> 00:46:50,373
and comes to his election presently.

530
00:47:10,293 --> 00:47:16,233
"Who chooses me
must give and hazard all he has."

531
00:47:20,613 --> 00:47:24,373
You shall look fairer ere I give or hazard.

532
00:47:33,233 --> 00:47:35,423
What says the golden chest?

533
00:47:37,612 --> 00:47:40,842
Ha! Let me see.

534
00:47:44,182 --> 00:47:50,542
"Who chooses me shall gain
what many men desire."

535
00:47:57,322 --> 00:48:00,762
I will not choose what many men desire

536
00:48:01,902 --> 00:48:05,762
because I will not jump
with common spirits

537
00:48:06,912 --> 00:48:10,042
and rank me with the barbarous multitude.

538
00:48:24,532 --> 00:48:26,722
"Who chooses me

539
00:48:26,832 --> 00:48:31,732
"shall get as much as he deserves."

540
00:48:33,602 --> 00:48:36,212
And well said, too.

541
00:48:41,212 --> 00:48:43,092
(Spits)

542
00:48:52,581 --> 00:48:55,081
- I will assume desert.
- (# Guitar chord)

543
00:48:55,191 --> 00:48:57,791
Give me a key for this

544
00:48:57,901 --> 00:49:02,071
and instantly unlock my fortunes here.

545
00:49:27,411 --> 00:49:30,741
Too long a pause
for that which you find there.

546
00:49:33,561 --> 00:49:35,331
What's here?

547
00:49:37,521 --> 00:49:43,571
The portrait of a blinking idiot
presenting me a schedule?

548
00:49:49,931 --> 00:49:53,271
Did I deserve no more than a fool's head?

549
00:49:53,371 --> 00:49:55,771
Is that my prize?

550
00:50:00,251 --> 00:50:02,960
Are my deserts no better?

551
00:50:03,070 --> 00:50:06,610
To offend and judge are distinct offices
and of opposed natures.

552
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:16,310
With one fool's head

553
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:18,920
I came to woo.

554
00:50:22,050 --> 00:50:25,070
But I go away with two.

555
00:50:31,850 --> 00:50:35,600
Antonio's ship is wrecked,
gone down with all hands,

556
00:50:35,710 --> 00:50:37,790
all merchandise lost.

557
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:41,860
(Women calling)

558
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:43,940
Come on up! Come on up.

559
00:50:45,510 --> 00:50:47,490
(Woman) Who is that there?

560
00:50:47,590 --> 00:50:49,570
- Jew!
- The Jew! Hey!

561
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:52,490
Take some pleasure with us!

562
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:54,890
Taste my Christian flesh!

563
00:50:54,890 --> 00:50:57,600
(# Lute playing, woman singing)

564
00:50:59,380 --> 00:51:02,090
(Laughter)

565
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:14,180
- What news on the Rialto?
- Why, yet it lives there unchecked

566
00:51:14,290 --> 00:51:18,139
that Antonio hath a ship of rich lading
wrecked on the narrow seas -

567
00:51:18,249 --> 00:51:22,629
The Goodwins, I think they call the place,
a very dangerous flat and fatal -

568
00:51:22,729 --> 00:51:25,959
Where the carcasses of
many a tall ship lie buried.

569
00:51:25,959 --> 00:51:27,009
What say you?

570
00:51:27,109 --> 00:51:30,139
I would it might prove
the end of his losses.

571
00:51:40,149 --> 00:51:42,859
How now, Shylock?

572
00:51:45,669 --> 00:51:48,279
What news amongst the merchants?

573
00:51:48,379 --> 00:51:51,199
You knew of my daughter's flight.

574
00:51:53,489 --> 00:51:55,989
None so well.

575
00:51:57,039 --> 00:51:58,809
None so well as you.

576
00:51:58,909 --> 00:52:02,559
And Shylock for his own part
knew the bird was fledged

577
00:52:02,669 --> 00:52:05,999
and then it is the complexion of them all
to leave the dam.

578
00:52:06,109 --> 00:52:08,399
She be damned for it.

579
00:52:08,509 --> 00:52:14,449
Tell us, do you hear whether Antonio
have had any loss at sea or no?

580
00:52:16,219 --> 00:52:18,409
Let him look to his bond.

581
00:52:19,659 --> 00:52:24,669
He was wont to call me usurer.
Let him look to his bond.

582
00:52:25,709 --> 00:52:30,088
He was wont to lend money
for Christian courtesy.

583
00:52:30,198 --> 00:52:32,388
Let him look to his bond.

584
00:52:35,198 --> 00:52:36,868
(Woman) Hello, Jew!

585
00:52:36,968 --> 00:52:41,768
I'm sure if he forfeit you'll not take
his flesh. What's that good for?

586
00:52:43,018 --> 00:52:45,108
To bait fish withal.

587
00:52:46,048 --> 00:52:50,628
If it will feed nothing else,
it will feed my revenge.

588
00:52:52,718 --> 00:52:55,118
He hath disgraced me

589
00:52:55,218 --> 00:52:58,558
and hindered me half a million,

590
00:52:58,658 --> 00:53:02,518
laughed at my losses, mocked at my gains,

591
00:53:02,618 --> 00:53:06,068
scorned my nation, thwarted my bargains,

592
00:53:06,068 --> 00:53:09,508
cooled my friends, heated mine enemies,
and what's his reason?

593
00:53:09,608 --> 00:53:11,698
I am a Jew!

594
00:53:13,358 --> 00:53:15,548
Hath not a Jew eyes?

595
00:53:15,658 --> 00:53:17,738
Hath not a Jew hands?

596
00:53:17,848 --> 00:53:20,348
Organs, dimensions?

597
00:53:20,458 --> 00:53:23,268
Senses, affections, passions?

598
00:53:24,728 --> 00:53:26,918
Fed with the same food?

599
00:53:27,858 --> 00:53:30,148
Hurt with the same weapons?

600
00:53:30,258 --> 00:53:32,338
Subject to the same diseases?

601
00:53:32,448 --> 00:53:35,258
Healed by the same means?

602
00:53:35,258 --> 00:53:40,368
Warmed and cooled by the same
winter and summer as a Christian is?

603
00:53:41,098 --> 00:53:44,327
If you prick us, do we not bleed?

604
00:53:44,437 --> 00:53:47,357
If you tickle us, do we not laugh?

605
00:53:47,357 --> 00:53:50,377
If you poison us, do we not die?

606
00:53:50,487 --> 00:53:53,507
And if you wrong us, shall we not revenge?

607
00:53:55,907 --> 00:53:59,237
If we are like you in the rest,
we will resemble you in that.

608
00:54:00,907 --> 00:54:06,437
If a Jew wrong a Christian,
what is his humility? Revenge.

609
00:54:06,537 --> 00:54:08,627
If a Christian wrong a Jew,

610
00:54:08,727 --> 00:54:12,587
what should his sufferance be
by Christian example?

611
00:54:13,627 --> 00:54:15,817
Why, revenge.

612
00:54:15,927 --> 00:54:20,307
The villainy you teach me I will execute.

613
00:54:20,407 --> 00:54:25,517
And it shall go hard
but I will better the instruction.

614
00:54:29,687 --> 00:54:33,647
Antonio is at his house.
We should speak with him.

615
00:54:42,097 --> 00:54:43,977
How now, Tubal?

616
00:54:47,627 --> 00:54:49,817
What news from Genoa?

617
00:54:51,167 --> 00:54:56,906
- Have you found my daughter?
- I often came where I did hear of her

618
00:54:57,006 --> 00:54:59,296
but cannot find her.

619
00:55:02,636 --> 00:55:04,406
Why...

620
00:55:04,516 --> 00:55:08,896
there, there, there.

621
00:55:08,896 --> 00:55:11,186
A diamond gone.

622
00:55:12,336 --> 00:55:16,606
Cost me two thousand ducats in Frankfurt.

623
00:55:19,426 --> 00:55:22,766
The curse never fell upon our nation
till now.

624
00:55:24,536 --> 00:55:26,826
I never felt it.

625
00:55:27,976 --> 00:55:30,066
Till now.

626
00:55:32,666 --> 00:55:37,156
I would my daughter were dead at my foot

627
00:55:38,616 --> 00:55:41,006
and the jewel in her ear.

628
00:55:43,716 --> 00:55:45,806
No news of them?

629
00:55:46,636 --> 00:55:50,816
- (Bell tolling)
- Loss upon loss.

630
00:55:52,686 --> 00:55:56,856
The thief gone with so much
and so much to find the thief.

631
00:55:58,636 --> 00:56:03,326
And no satisfaction, no revenge,

632
00:56:04,676 --> 00:56:07,705
no luck stirring

633
00:56:07,705 --> 00:56:10,415
but what lights on my shoulders.

634
00:56:11,355 --> 00:56:15,525
No sighs

635
00:56:16,875 --> 00:56:19,065
but of my breathing.

636
00:56:20,215 --> 00:56:23,765
No tears but of my shedding.

637
00:56:23,865 --> 00:56:27,725
Yes, other men have ill luck, too.

638
00:56:29,595 --> 00:56:33,045
Antonio, as I heard in Genoa.

639
00:56:33,145 --> 00:56:35,025
What?

640
00:56:35,125 --> 00:56:37,835
What, what? Ill luck?

641
00:56:39,195 --> 00:56:42,425
There's a ship, wrecked,
coming from Tripolis.

642
00:56:42,525 --> 00:56:45,035
Oh, I thank God.

643
00:56:45,135 --> 00:56:47,115
I thank God.

644
00:56:47,225 --> 00:56:49,725
Oh!

645
00:56:52,015 --> 00:56:55,045
Heard you in Genoa what?

646
00:56:56,605 --> 00:56:59,835
Your daughter spent in Genoa,

647
00:56:59,945 --> 00:57:02,345
as I heard,

648
00:57:02,345 --> 00:57:05,675
one night, four score ducats.

649
00:57:11,515 --> 00:57:13,605
Oh, you stick a dagger in me.

650
00:57:16,205 --> 00:57:18,505
I shall never see my gold again.

651
00:57:20,065 --> 00:57:22,984
Four score ducats!

652
00:57:23,094 --> 00:57:25,074
At a sitting!

653
00:57:25,174 --> 00:57:27,474
Four score ducats!

654
00:57:29,764 --> 00:57:36,124
There came various of Antonio's creditors
in my company to Venice

655
00:57:37,164 --> 00:57:41,544
- that swear he cannot choose but break.
- I am very glad of it.

656
00:57:41,654 --> 00:57:43,734
I'll plague him.

657
00:57:43,844 --> 00:57:47,174
I'll torture him. I am glad of it.

658
00:57:47,174 --> 00:57:51,554
One of them showed me a ring
he had of your daughter

659
00:57:51,664 --> 00:57:53,534
for a monkey.

660
00:57:58,754 --> 00:58:01,154
(Shylock) How dare her!

661
00:58:02,604 --> 00:58:05,734
Tubal, you torture me.

662
00:58:05,844 --> 00:58:07,714
It was my turquoise.

663
00:58:07,824 --> 00:58:12,934
I had it of Leah, her mother,
when I was a bachelor.

664
00:58:15,124 --> 00:58:20,024
I would not have given it away
for a wilderness of monkeys.

665
00:58:20,124 --> 00:58:24,504
But Antonio is certainly undone.

666
00:58:27,114 --> 00:58:29,094
That is true.

667
00:58:32,014 --> 00:58:36,493
Tubal, go, find me an officer.

668
00:58:37,433 --> 00:58:40,253
Bespeak him a fortnight before.

669
00:58:41,603 --> 00:58:44,313
I will have Antonio's heart if he forfeit.

670
00:58:47,023 --> 00:58:50,573
Go, go, Tubal -
at our synagogue, good Tubal.

671
00:58:57,353 --> 00:59:00,163
(Oarsmen) Oh... ehi!

672
00:59:02,463 --> 00:59:05,383
Madam!

673
00:59:06,213 --> 00:59:09,653
There is alighted at your gate
a young Venetian,

674
00:59:09,763 --> 00:59:13,203
one who comes to signify
the approaching of his lord.

675
00:59:13,303 --> 00:59:18,203
I have not seen
so likely an ambassador of love!

676
00:59:18,313 --> 00:59:22,163
A day in April never came so sweet
to show how costly summer was at hand

677
00:59:22,273 --> 00:59:26,233
as this... oh! Forerunner
comes before his lord.

678
00:59:26,343 --> 00:59:30,513
No more, I pray you. I'm half afraid
you will say anon he is some kin to you,

679
00:59:30,613 --> 00:59:33,533
you spin such high-day wit in praising him.

680
00:59:34,363 --> 00:59:36,453
Come. Come, Nerissa,

681
00:59:36,553 --> 00:59:41,563
for I long to see quick Cupid's post
that comes so mannerly.

682
00:59:41,663 --> 00:59:45,313
Bassanio, lord Love, if your will it be.

683
00:59:52,512 --> 00:59:55,742
There's something tells me,
but it is not love.

684
00:59:55,842 --> 00:59:58,032
I would not lose you.

685
00:59:58,142 --> 01:00:02,412
And yourself knows
hate counsels not in such a quality.

686
01:00:26,082 --> 01:00:30,882
(I would detain you here a month
or two before you venture for me.

687
01:00:30,982 --> 01:00:33,692
I could teach you
how to choose right

688
01:00:33,802 --> 01:00:36,822
but then I'd break my oath.

689
01:00:36,932 --> 01:00:39,012
That will I never do.

690
01:00:40,372 --> 01:00:42,872
So may you miss me

691
01:00:42,982 --> 01:00:46,622
and if you do, you make me wish that sin
that I had broke my oath.

692
01:01:02,791 --> 01:01:05,291
(Portia) Contend me with your eyes

693
01:01:05,391 --> 01:01:08,211
for they have o'erlooked me
and divided me.

694
01:01:19,891 --> 01:01:24,271
One half of me is yours, the other half
yours, mine own, I would say,

695
01:01:24,371 --> 01:01:26,561
but if mine, then yours and so...

696
01:01:26,671 --> 01:01:28,851
all yours.

697
01:01:37,721 --> 01:01:41,991
Let me choose,
for as I am, I live upon the rack.

698
01:01:42,101 --> 01:01:44,811
Upon the rack, Bassanio?

699
01:01:44,911 --> 01:01:48,151
Then confess what
treason there is mingled with your love.

700
01:01:48,251 --> 01:01:51,381
None but that ugly treason of mistrust

701
01:01:53,051 --> 01:01:55,761
which makes me fear
the enjoying of my love.

702
01:01:55,761 --> 01:01:58,261
Ay but I fear you speak upon the rack,

703
01:01:58,361 --> 01:02:00,971
when men enforced do speak anything.

704
01:02:01,071 --> 01:02:03,261
Promise me life

705
01:02:03,371 --> 01:02:05,351
and I'll confess the truth.

706
01:02:05,451 --> 01:02:07,641
Well, then,

707
01:02:08,901 --> 01:02:10,981
confess and live.

708
01:02:11,081 --> 01:02:15,780
Confess and love has been
the very sum of my confession.

709
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:22,660
But let me to my fortune and the caskets.

710
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:26,730
Away, then.

711
01:02:26,830 --> 01:02:29,120
I am locked in one of them.

712
01:02:29,230 --> 01:02:32,250
(# Harp plays)

713
01:02:32,250 --> 01:02:37,470
# Tell me where is fancy bred

714
01:02:41,220 --> 01:02:46,330
# Or in the heart or in the head?

715
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:53,210
# How begot

716
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:57,690
# How nourished

717
01:03:25,639 --> 01:03:33,039
So may the outward shows
be least themselves.

718
01:03:35,019 --> 01:03:38,359
The world is still deceived
with ornament.

719
01:03:39,399 --> 01:03:43,469
In law, what plea so tainted and corrupt

720
01:03:43,569 --> 01:03:49,729
but being seasoned with a gracious voice
obscures the show of evil?

721
01:03:50,979 --> 01:03:54,109
In religion,

722
01:03:54,209 --> 01:03:57,959
what damned error
but some sober brow will bless it

723
01:03:58,069 --> 01:04:00,259
and approve it with a text,

724
01:04:00,359 --> 01:04:05,989
hiding the grossness with fair... ornament?

725
01:04:12,249 --> 01:04:14,329
Look on beauty

726
01:04:15,379 --> 01:04:17,669
and you shall see

727
01:04:19,029 --> 01:04:21,009
'tis purchased

728
01:04:21,739 --> 01:04:24,969
by the weight.

729
01:04:25,069 --> 01:04:30,079
Therefore, thou gaudy gold,
I will none of you.

730
01:04:32,369 --> 01:04:37,169
Nor none of you, O pale and common
drudge between man and man.

731
01:04:39,148 --> 01:04:43,738
But you, O meagre lead,

732
01:04:43,838 --> 01:04:48,328
which rather threatenest
than dost promise aught,

733
01:04:48,428 --> 01:04:51,138
your paleness moves me more...

734
01:04:53,848 --> 01:04:56,148
than eloquence.

735
01:05:03,028 --> 01:05:05,528
Here choose I.

736
01:05:14,498 --> 01:05:16,578
Joy be the consequence.

737
01:05:16,688 --> 01:05:19,298
O love, be moderate, allay your ecstasy,

738
01:05:19,398 --> 01:05:22,948
I feel too much your blessing -
make it less for fear I surfeit.

739
01:05:33,368 --> 01:05:35,458
What find I here?

740
01:05:48,278 --> 01:05:51,517
- Fair Portia's counterfeit.

741
01:05:55,997 --> 01:06:01,207
Oh, what demi-goddess
comes so near creation?

742
01:06:02,777 --> 01:06:08,297
Move these eyes? Or whether, riding on
the balls of mine, seem they in motion?

743
01:06:09,657 --> 01:06:12,997
But her eyes -
how could he see to do them?

744
01:06:14,037 --> 01:06:16,747
But look how far
the substance of my praise

745
01:06:16,847 --> 01:06:20,187
does wrong this shadow
in underpraising it,

746
01:06:20,187 --> 01:06:26,027
so far this shadow
doth limp behind the substance.

747
01:06:29,047 --> 01:06:30,617
(# Jaunty music)

748
01:06:31,137 --> 01:06:33,217
(Laughter)

749
01:06:35,407 --> 01:06:39,167
Here's the scroll -
the continent and summary of my fortune.

750
01:06:43,127 --> 01:06:46,257
"You that choose not by the view

751
01:06:46,257 --> 01:06:49,277
"Chances fair and chooses true

752
01:06:50,217 --> 01:06:52,407
"Since this fortune falls on you

753
01:06:52,507 --> 01:06:55,017
"Be content and seek no new

754
01:06:55,747 --> 01:06:58,037
"If you be well pleased with this

755
01:06:58,147 --> 01:07:00,857
"Then hold your fortune for your bliss

756
01:07:02,837 --> 01:07:05,236
"Turn you where your lady is

757
01:07:06,896 --> 01:07:10,866
"And claim her with a loving kiss"

758
01:07:12,946 --> 01:07:16,496
- (Cheering)
- A gentle scroll!

759
01:07:17,956 --> 01:07:20,036
Fair lady,

760
01:07:20,146 --> 01:07:24,626
by your leave, I come by note

761
01:07:24,726 --> 01:07:26,816
to give.

762
01:07:32,556 --> 01:07:35,786
And to receive.

763
01:07:42,456 --> 01:07:44,546
Like one of two contending in a prize

764
01:07:44,646 --> 01:07:47,256
That thinks he has done well
in people's eyes

765
01:07:47,356 --> 01:07:49,966
Hearing applause and universal shout

766
01:07:50,066 --> 01:07:52,986
Giddy in spirit, still gazing in a doubt

767
01:07:53,096 --> 01:07:56,636
As doubtful whether what I see be true

768
01:07:57,576 --> 01:08:02,056
Until confirmed, signed, ratified

769
01:08:02,166 --> 01:08:04,456
by you

770
01:08:11,546 --> 01:08:14,786
You see me, lord Bassanio,
where I stand, such as I am.

771
01:08:17,175 --> 01:08:18,635
Though for myself alone

772
01:08:18,635 --> 01:08:23,015
I would not be ambitious in my wish
to wish myself much better,

773
01:08:24,265 --> 01:08:26,565
yet for you,

774
01:08:26,665 --> 01:08:30,105
I would be treble twenty times myself.

775
01:08:32,505 --> 01:08:36,055
A thousand times more fair,

776
01:08:36,155 --> 01:08:38,245
ten thousand times more rich,

777
01:08:38,245 --> 01:08:43,875
that only to stand high in your account,
I might in virtues, beauties,

778
01:08:43,975 --> 01:08:47,935
livings, friends,

779
01:08:49,195 --> 01:08:51,065
exceed account.

780
01:08:52,525 --> 01:08:55,135
But the full sum of me

781
01:08:55,235 --> 01:08:58,885
is sum of something
which, to term in gross,

782
01:09:00,655 --> 01:09:02,845
is an unlessoned girl,

783
01:09:03,575 --> 01:09:06,815
unschooled, unpractised.

784
01:09:09,735 --> 01:09:13,275
Happy in this,
she is not yet so old that she may learn.

785
01:09:14,635 --> 01:09:18,905
Happier than this,
she is not bred so dull that she may learn.

786
01:09:20,995 --> 01:09:23,075
Happiest of all,

787
01:09:24,125 --> 01:09:28,395
is that her gentle spirit
commits itself to yours to be directed

788
01:09:29,964 --> 01:09:32,254
as by her governor,

789
01:09:32,254 --> 01:09:34,134
her lord,

790
01:09:35,794 --> 01:09:37,884
her king.

791
01:09:42,264 --> 01:09:46,224
This house, these servants,

792
01:09:47,374 --> 01:09:49,774
and this same myself

793
01:09:50,914 --> 01:09:53,104
are yours,

794
01:09:53,214 --> 01:09:55,194
my lord's.

795
01:10:01,654 --> 01:10:03,954
I give them with this ring,

796
01:10:05,204 --> 01:10:10,624
which when you part from,
lose or give away,

797
01:10:14,794 --> 01:10:17,824
let it presage the ruin of your love.

798
01:10:21,674 --> 01:10:23,974
And give me vantage to exclaim on you.

799
01:10:31,164 --> 01:10:33,044
Madam,

800
01:10:34,404 --> 01:10:37,424
you have bereft me of all words.

801
01:10:39,714 --> 01:10:42,423
Only my blood speaks to you in my veins,

802
01:10:42,423 --> 01:10:45,973
there is such confusion in my powers.

803
01:10:48,583 --> 01:10:53,063
But when this ring parts from this finger

804
01:10:55,883 --> 01:10:58,073
then parts life from hence -

805
01:10:58,173 --> 01:11:02,243
O, then be bold to say Bassanio's dead.

806
01:11:06,513 --> 01:11:08,703
(Cheering)

807
01:11:23,723 --> 01:11:25,183
(Clears throat)

808
01:11:25,283 --> 01:11:28,933
My lord Bassanio, my gentle lady,

809
01:11:29,033 --> 01:11:31,953
I wish you all the joy that you can wish

810
01:11:32,063 --> 01:11:35,923
and when your honours mean to solemnize
the bargain of your faith,

811
01:11:35,923 --> 01:11:41,863
I do beseech you even at that time,
I may be married, too.

812
01:11:47,493 --> 01:11:50,313
With all my heart.

813
01:11:50,313 --> 01:11:52,913
If you can get a wife.

814
01:11:53,023 --> 01:11:56,252
I thank you, your lordship,
you have got me one.

815
01:11:56,352 --> 01:11:59,062
My eyes, my lord,
can look as swift as yours.

816
01:12:00,112 --> 01:12:03,552
You saw the mistress,

817
01:12:05,632 --> 01:12:07,722
I beheld the maid.

818
01:12:07,822 --> 01:12:10,012
Is it true, Nerissa?

819
01:12:10,122 --> 01:12:12,932
- Madam, it is!
- Oh!

820
01:12:13,042 --> 01:12:15,642
And do you, Gratiano, mean good faith?

821
01:12:15,752 --> 01:12:17,942
Yes, faith, my lord.

822
01:12:19,502 --> 01:12:22,842
Our feast shall be much honoured
in your marriage.

823
01:12:34,202 --> 01:12:38,692
We'll play with them
the first boy for a thousand ducats.

824
01:12:38,792 --> 01:12:41,502
- What, with stake down?
- No.

825
01:12:41,502 --> 01:12:44,742
We shall never win at that sport
with stake down.

826
01:12:47,452 --> 01:12:51,102
(Man) Ho, there! Ho!

827
01:12:53,602 --> 01:12:55,792
But who comes here?

828
01:13:09,661 --> 01:13:12,991
There are some shrewd contents
in yond same paper,

829
01:13:13,101 --> 01:13:16,331
that do steal the colour
from Bassanio's cheek.

830
01:13:16,431 --> 01:13:20,921
Some dear friend dead, else nothing
in the world could turn the constitution

831
01:13:21,021 --> 01:13:23,111
of any constant man.

832
01:13:23,111 --> 01:13:25,711
What, worse and worse!

833
01:13:31,451 --> 01:13:33,741
With leave, Bassanio,

834
01:13:33,741 --> 01:13:36,771
I am half yourself

835
01:13:36,871 --> 01:13:41,671
and I must freely have half of anything
that this same letter brings you.

836
01:13:41,671 --> 01:13:43,341
O sweet Portia,

837
01:13:43,441 --> 01:13:48,031
they are a few of the unpleasantest words
that ever blotted paper.

838
01:13:51,991 --> 01:13:55,331
Gentle lady,

839
01:13:55,431 --> 01:13:59,391
when I did first impart my love to you,

840
01:13:59,501 --> 01:14:03,041
I freely told you
all the wealth I had ran in my veins -

841
01:14:03,151 --> 01:14:06,171
I was a gentleman and then I told you true.

842
01:14:06,281 --> 01:14:09,201
And yet, dear lady,

843
01:14:09,201 --> 01:14:12,221
rating myself at nothing,

844
01:14:13,051 --> 01:14:16,291
you shall see how much I was a braggart.

845
01:14:16,391 --> 01:14:19,001
When I told you my estate was nothing,

846
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:24,210
I should have told you
I was worse than nothing,

847
01:14:24,310 --> 01:14:28,900
for, indeed, I have engaged myself
to a dear friend,

848
01:14:29,010 --> 01:14:32,030
who engaged my dear friend
to his mere enemy

849
01:14:34,330 --> 01:14:36,410
to feed my means.

850
01:14:37,660 --> 01:14:42,560
Here is a letter, lady.
The paper is the body of my friend

851
01:14:42,670 --> 01:14:46,320
and every word in it a gaping wound
issuing life-blood.

852
01:14:46,420 --> 01:14:51,950
But is it true, Salerio? What,
all his ventures failed? What, not one hit?

853
01:14:51,950 --> 01:14:54,970
From Tripolis, from Mexico, from England?

854
01:14:55,080 --> 01:14:56,850
Not one, my lord.

855
01:14:56,950 --> 01:15:00,810
Besides it appears that if he had
the present money to discharge the Jew,

856
01:15:00,910 --> 01:15:03,310
he would not take it.

857
01:15:03,420 --> 01:15:07,800
He plies the duke at morning and at night
and doth impeach the freedom of the state

858
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:09,460
if they deny him justice.

859
01:15:09,570 --> 01:15:11,450
Twenty merchants, the duke himself

860
01:15:11,550 --> 01:15:15,510
and the magnificoes of greatest port
have all persuaded with him

861
01:15:15,510 --> 01:15:21,460
but none can drive him from the envious
plea of forfeiture, of justice, and his bond.

862
01:15:24,900 --> 01:15:27,090
When I was with him,

863
01:15:27,190 --> 01:15:31,360
I have heard him swear
to Tubal and to Cush, his countrymen,

864
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:34,489
that he would rather have Antonio's flesh

865
01:15:34,589 --> 01:15:38,139
than twenty times the value of the sum
that he did owe him.

866
01:15:39,599 --> 01:15:41,579
And I know, my lord,

867
01:15:41,679 --> 01:15:44,599
if law, authority and power deny not,

868
01:15:47,319 --> 01:15:49,399
it will go hard with poor Antonio.

869
01:15:52,739 --> 01:15:55,759
Is it your dear friend
that is thus in trouble?

870
01:15:55,759 --> 01:15:57,849
The dearest friend to me.

871
01:16:00,869 --> 01:16:03,159
What sum owes he the Jew?

872
01:16:04,419 --> 01:16:07,019
For me, three thousand ducats.

873
01:16:08,799 --> 01:16:10,459
No more?

874
01:16:11,399 --> 01:16:14,109
Pay him six thousand and deface the bond.

875
01:16:14,109 --> 01:16:17,029
Double six thousand and then treble that

876
01:16:17,139 --> 01:16:22,869
before a friend of this description should
lose a hair through Bassanio's fault.

877
01:16:25,169 --> 01:16:27,879
Let me hear the letter of your friend.

878
01:16:30,799 --> 01:16:34,649
"Sweet Bassanio, my ships have
all miscarried, my creditors grow cruel,

879
01:16:34,759 --> 01:16:36,949
"my estate is very low.

880
01:16:38,829 --> 01:16:43,829
"My bond to the Jew is forfeit and since
in paying it, it is impossible I should live,

881
01:16:43,939 --> 01:16:47,378
"all debts are cleared between you and I,

882
01:16:47,478 --> 01:16:50,398
"if I might but see you at my death.

883
01:16:50,398 --> 01:16:52,488
"Notwithstanding, use your pleasure -

884
01:16:54,048 --> 01:16:58,428
"if love do not persuade you to come,
let not my letter."

885
01:17:00,618 --> 01:17:02,698
O love,

886
01:17:05,518 --> 01:17:07,708
dispatch all business and be gone!

887
01:17:07,708 --> 01:17:09,788
First...

888
01:17:11,048 --> 01:17:13,758
go with me to church and call me wife.

889
01:17:15,008 --> 01:17:18,338
Then away to Venice, to your friend.

890
01:17:20,948 --> 01:17:25,328
For never shall you lie by Portia's side
with an unquiet soul.

891
01:17:26,898 --> 01:17:30,228
You shall have gold to pay
the petty debt twenty times over.

892
01:17:30,338 --> 01:17:35,448
When it is paid,
bring your true friend along.

893
01:17:37,318 --> 01:17:42,118
Meantime, myself and Nerissa
will live as maids and widows.

894
01:17:44,928 --> 01:17:47,118
Come, away,

895
01:17:47,118 --> 01:17:49,828
for you shall hence

896
01:17:49,828 --> 01:17:52,018
upon your wedding day.

897
01:18:09,127 --> 01:18:13,297
Gaoler, look to him, tell me not of mercy.

898
01:18:13,397 --> 01:18:18,507
This is the fool that lent out money gratis.
Gaoler, look to him.

899
01:18:18,607 --> 01:18:20,597
Hear me yet, good Shylock.

900
01:18:20,697 --> 01:18:24,657
I'll have my bond.
Speak not against my bond.

901
01:18:24,767 --> 01:18:27,887
I have sworn an oath
that I will have my bond.

902
01:18:27,997 --> 01:18:30,917
You called me dog before you had a cause.

903
01:18:31,017 --> 01:18:33,727
But since I am a dog, beware my fangs.

904
01:18:33,837 --> 01:18:36,547
The duke will grant me justice.

905
01:18:36,647 --> 01:18:38,627
I do wonder, you wicked gaolers,

906
01:18:38,737 --> 01:18:42,277
you are so fond
to come abroad with him at his request.

907
01:18:42,387 --> 01:18:44,887
- I pray you, hear me speak!
- I'll have my bond,

908
01:18:44,987 --> 01:18:46,657
I will not hear you speak.

909
01:18:46,767 --> 01:18:49,577
I'll have my bond, therefore speak no more.

910
01:18:49,687 --> 01:18:53,017
I'll not be made a soft and dull-eyed fool,

911
01:18:53,127 --> 01:19:00,007
to shake their head, relent and sigh
and yield to Christian intercessors.

912
01:19:00,107 --> 01:19:02,197
I'll have no speaking, follow not.

913
01:19:04,177 --> 01:19:06,367
I will have my bond.

914
01:19:07,517 --> 01:19:11,377
It is the most impenetrable cur
that ever kept with men.

915
01:19:11,477 --> 01:19:13,566
Let him alone.

916
01:19:15,856 --> 01:19:19,296
I'll follow him no more
with bootless prayers.

917
01:19:22,526 --> 01:19:24,616
He seeks my life.

918
01:19:26,286 --> 01:19:28,366
His reason well I know.

919
01:19:30,556 --> 01:19:34,416
I'm sure the duke will never grant
this forfeiture to hold!

920
01:19:34,516 --> 01:19:37,026
The duke cannot deny the course of law.

921
01:19:37,126 --> 01:19:41,716
For the commodity that strangers have
with us in Venice, if it be denied,

922
01:19:41,816 --> 01:19:44,426
will much impeach the justice of the state.

923
01:19:46,516 --> 01:19:48,596
Therefore, go.

924
01:19:52,456 --> 01:19:54,956
Oh!

925
01:19:54,956 --> 01:19:58,606
These griefs and losses have so bated me

926
01:19:58,716 --> 01:20:02,986
that I shall hardly find a pound of flesh
tomorrow for my bloody creditor.

927
01:20:07,056 --> 01:20:10,176
Pray God Bassanio come
to see me pay his debt.

928
01:20:11,536 --> 01:20:14,036
Then I care not.

929
01:20:25,715 --> 01:20:28,845
Madam, if you knew
to whom you show this honour,

930
01:20:28,945 --> 01:20:31,455
how true a gentleman you send relief,

931
01:20:31,555 --> 01:20:34,575
how dear a lover of my lord your husband,

932
01:20:34,575 --> 01:20:39,275
I know you would be prouder of the work
than customary kindness would allow you.

933
01:20:39,375 --> 01:20:42,295
I never did repent for doing good,
I shall not now.

934
01:20:42,395 --> 01:20:45,735
For in companions that do
converse and waste the time together

935
01:20:45,845 --> 01:20:51,265
there needs must be a like proportion
of lineaments, of manners and of spirit.

936
01:20:52,515 --> 01:20:58,775
Which makes me think that this Antonio,
being the bosom lover of my lord,

937
01:20:58,875 --> 01:21:01,275
must needs be like my lord.

938
01:21:01,375 --> 01:21:04,715
If it be so, how little
is the cost I have bestowed

939
01:21:04,815 --> 01:21:09,715
in purchasing the semblance of my soul
from out of this state of hellish cruelty.

940
01:21:10,555 --> 01:21:12,845
This comes too near
the praising of myself.

941
01:21:12,955 --> 01:21:15,455
Therefore, no more of it. Hear other things.

942
01:21:15,555 --> 01:21:19,835
Lorenzo, I commit into your hands
the husbandry and manage of my house

943
01:21:19,935 --> 01:21:21,295
until my lord's return.

944
01:21:21,395 --> 01:21:24,835
For my own part, I have towards heaven
breathed a secret vow

945
01:21:24,945 --> 01:21:28,595
to live in prayer and contemplation,
only attended by Nerissa here,

946
01:21:28,695 --> 01:21:32,245
- until my husband and her lord's return.
- Madam, with all my heart,

947
01:21:32,345 --> 01:21:34,325
I shall obey you in all fair commands.

948
01:21:34,435 --> 01:21:37,454
Fair thoughts and happy hours
attend on you.

949
01:21:37,554 --> 01:21:42,044
Go, speed to Padua, render this
into my cousin's hands, old Bellario.

950
01:21:42,144 --> 01:21:43,714
Go!

951
01:21:51,534 --> 01:21:54,344
Is it not so, cousin Bellario?

952
01:21:54,454 --> 01:21:56,434
(# Lute music)

953
01:22:08,844 --> 01:22:13,954
# How sweet the rose... #

954
01:22:14,054 --> 01:22:17,074
See, Jessica.

955
01:22:17,184 --> 01:22:23,644
Look how the floor of heaven is
thick inlaid with patterns of bright gold.

956
01:22:25,314 --> 01:22:30,734
Is not the smallest orb that you behold
but in his motion like an angel sings?

957
01:22:35,114 --> 01:22:38,874
Such harmony is in immortal souls.

958
01:22:39,704 --> 01:22:44,714
But whilst this muddy vesture of decay
doth grossly close it in,

959
01:22:44,814 --> 01:22:46,794
- we cannot hear it.
- Hm.

960
01:22:47,944 --> 01:22:50,653
I am never merry when I hear sweet music.

961
01:22:52,423 --> 01:22:54,923
The reason is your spirits are attentive.

962
01:22:55,033 --> 01:22:57,643
The man that hath no music in himself

963
01:22:57,643 --> 01:23:00,973
nor is not moved
with concord of sweet sounds

964
01:23:00,973 --> 01:23:04,733
is fit for treasons, stratagems and spoils.

965
01:23:04,833 --> 01:23:07,963
The motions of his spirit are
as dull as night

966
01:23:08,063 --> 01:23:10,773
and his affections are as dark as Erebus.

967
01:23:12,233 --> 01:23:15,673
Let no such man be trusted.

968
01:23:15,783 --> 01:23:17,863
Mark the music.

969
01:23:19,013 --> 01:23:23,503
# Sweet rose... #

970
01:23:24,543 --> 01:23:28,083
(Portia) We shall see our husbands
before they think of us.

971
01:23:28,193 --> 01:23:30,063
Shall they see us?

972
01:23:30,173 --> 01:23:32,253
They shall, Nerissa,

973
01:23:32,363 --> 01:23:37,153
but in such a habit that they shall think
we are accomplished with what we lack.

974
01:23:38,093 --> 01:23:42,473
I'll hold you any wager, when we are both
accoutred like young men,

975
01:23:42,583 --> 01:23:45,293
I'll prove the prettier fellow of the two.

976
01:23:58,953 --> 01:24:01,763
(Duke) Go one and call the Jew
to the court.

977
01:24:04,892 --> 01:24:07,392
Make room and let him stand
before our face.

978
01:24:15,842 --> 01:24:17,302
He is come, my lord.

979
01:24:36,382 --> 01:24:41,072
Shylock, the world thinks,
and I think so, too,

980
01:24:41,182 --> 01:24:46,082
that you but lead'st this fashion
of your malice to the last hour of the act

981
01:24:46,182 --> 01:24:50,042
and then 'tis thought
you'll show your mercy and remorse,

982
01:24:50,152 --> 01:24:54,522
more strange than is
your strange apparent cruelty.

983
01:24:56,302 --> 01:24:58,072
What say you, Jew?

984
01:24:58,172 --> 01:25:00,892
We all expect a gentle answer.

985
01:25:00,892 --> 01:25:05,162
I have informed your grace
of what I purpose

986
01:25:06,412 --> 01:25:13,192
and by our holy Sabbath have I sworn
to have the due and forfeit of my bond.

987
01:25:13,292 --> 01:25:15,802
If you deny it,

988
01:25:16,941 --> 01:25:21,321
let the danger light upon your charter
and your city's freedom.

989
01:25:22,991 --> 01:25:28,621
You'll ask me why I rather choose
to have a weight of human flesh

990
01:25:28,731 --> 01:25:31,751
than to receive three thousand ducats.

991
01:25:31,851 --> 01:25:33,941
I'll not answer that.

992
01:25:34,041 --> 01:25:37,381
But, say, it is my humour - is it answered?

993
01:25:40,301 --> 01:25:43,321
What if my house be troubled by a rat

994
01:25:43,431 --> 01:25:47,391
and I am pleased to give
ten thousand ducats to have it killed?

995
01:25:48,541 --> 01:25:51,561
- What, are you answered yet?
- No.

996
01:25:51,561 --> 01:25:54,381
Some men there are love not a gaping pig,

997
01:25:54,481 --> 01:25:56,671
some that are mad if they behold a cat

998
01:25:56,771 --> 01:26:01,681
and others when the bagpipe sings
in the nose cannot contain their urine.

999
01:26:01,781 --> 01:26:06,161
- (Laughter)
- For affection, master of passion, sways it

1000
01:26:06,261 --> 01:26:08,971
to the mood of what it likes or loathes.

1001
01:26:08,971 --> 01:26:10,851
Now for your answer.

1002
01:26:10,961 --> 01:26:16,381
As there is no firm reason to be rendered
why he cannot abide a gaping pig,

1003
01:26:16,481 --> 01:26:19,821
why he, a harmless, necessary cat,

1004
01:26:19,921 --> 01:26:22,111
why he a woollen bagpipe,

1005
01:26:22,221 --> 01:26:25,141
but of force must yield
to such inevitable shame

1006
01:26:25,141 --> 01:26:27,641
as to offend himself being offended,

1007
01:26:27,741 --> 01:26:29,930
so can I give no reason,

1008
01:26:29,930 --> 01:26:31,710
nor will I not,

1009
01:26:31,810 --> 01:26:38,590
more than a lodged hate
and a certain loathing I bear Antonio,

1010
01:26:38,690 --> 01:26:42,340
that I follow thus
this losing suit against him.

1011
01:26:44,530 --> 01:26:46,930
- Are you answered?
- (All) No!

1012
01:26:52,870 --> 01:26:58,300
This is no answer, you unfeeling man,
to excuse the current of your cruelty.

1013
01:26:58,300 --> 01:27:01,740
I am not bound to please you
with my answers.

1014
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:04,450
Do all men kill the things they do not love?

1015
01:27:05,390 --> 01:27:08,310
Hates any man the thing he would not kill?

1016
01:27:09,770 --> 01:27:12,480
Every offence is not a hate at first.

1017
01:27:12,480 --> 01:27:15,190
You would have a serpent sting you twice?

1018
01:27:15,290 --> 01:27:17,480
(Crowd shout in derision)

1019
01:27:17,480 --> 01:27:19,670
I pray you,

1020
01:27:21,240 --> 01:27:24,470
think you question with the Jew:

1021
01:27:27,700 --> 01:27:30,410
You may as well go stand upon the beach

1022
01:27:31,560 --> 01:27:36,250
and bid the main flood lower
its usual height.

1023
01:27:38,130 --> 01:27:39,590
(Sighs)

1024
01:27:39,590 --> 01:27:44,379
You may as well question with the wolf

1025
01:27:44,489 --> 01:27:47,819
why he has made
the ewe bleat for the lamb.

1026
01:27:49,809 --> 01:27:52,829
You may as well do anything most hard

1027
01:27:52,929 --> 01:27:55,539
as seek to soften that

1028
01:27:57,629 --> 01:28:00,649
than which what's harder, his Jewish heart.

1029
01:28:02,839 --> 01:28:07,219
Therefore I do beseech you, make
no more offers, use no farther means,

1030
01:28:07,319 --> 01:28:10,449
but with all just and plain conveniency
let me have judgment

1031
01:28:10,559 --> 01:28:12,749
and the Jew his will.

1032
01:28:12,749 --> 01:28:15,039
(All) No! No!

1033
01:28:15,979 --> 01:28:18,999
You loaned three thousand ducats.

1034
01:28:21,819 --> 01:28:24,009
Here is six.

1035
01:28:27,969 --> 01:28:30,159
(Crowd gasps)

1036
01:28:46,529 --> 01:28:51,949
If every ducat in six thousand ducats

1037
01:28:52,059 --> 01:28:56,748
were in six parts and every part a ducat

1038
01:28:57,898 --> 01:29:02,478
I would not draw them,
I would have my bond.

1039
01:29:02,588 --> 01:29:05,508
(Duke) How shall you hope for mercy,
giving none?

1040
01:29:05,608 --> 01:29:09,258
What judgment should I fear,
doing no wrong?

1041
01:29:09,358 --> 01:29:12,698
You have among you
many a purchased slave,

1042
01:29:12,808 --> 01:29:15,618
which like your asses
and your dogs and mules,

1043
01:29:15,728 --> 01:29:20,208
you use in abject and in slavish parts
because you bought them.

1044
01:29:20,308 --> 01:29:22,498
Shall I say to you, let them be free?

1045
01:29:23,438 --> 01:29:25,628
Marry them to your heirs.

1046
01:29:26,358 --> 01:29:28,858
Why sweat they under burdens?

1047
01:29:28,968 --> 01:29:31,778
Let their beds be made as soft as yours.

1048
01:29:32,928 --> 01:29:37,098
Their palates seasoned with your food.

1049
01:29:37,208 --> 01:29:41,378
You will answer, "The slaves are ours."

1050
01:29:41,478 --> 01:29:43,668
So do I answer you.

1051
01:29:43,768 --> 01:29:48,778
The pound of flesh that I demand of him

1052
01:29:48,878 --> 01:29:50,968
is dearly bought.

1053
01:29:53,048 --> 01:29:55,038
'Tis mine.

1054
01:29:56,908 --> 01:29:59,728
'Tis mine!

1055
01:30:01,398 --> 01:30:03,068
'Tis mine.

1056
01:30:05,248 --> 01:30:07,647
And I will have it.

1057
01:30:07,757 --> 01:30:12,867
If you deny me, fie upon your law.

1058
01:30:15,577 --> 01:30:19,437
There is no force in the decrees of Venice.

1059
01:30:20,787 --> 01:30:23,497
I stand for judgment.

1060
01:30:24,647 --> 01:30:26,837
Answer.

1061
01:30:27,777 --> 01:30:30,797
- Shall I have it?
- (Crowd gasp)

1062
01:30:30,907 --> 01:30:32,777
(Crowd shouting)

1063
01:30:35,807 --> 01:30:38,197
Silence! Silence!

1064
01:30:38,307 --> 01:30:42,167
Silence! Upon my power
I may dismiss this court

1065
01:30:42,267 --> 01:30:46,227
unless Bellario, a learned doctor
that I have sent for to determine this,

1066
01:30:46,337 --> 01:30:49,987
- come here today.
- My lord!

1067
01:30:50,087 --> 01:30:53,217
Here stays without a messenger
with letters from the doctor

1068
01:30:53,317 --> 01:30:54,577
new come from Padua.

1069
01:31:00,617 --> 01:31:03,227
Come you from Padua, from old Bellario?

1070
01:31:03,327 --> 01:31:06,667
From both, my lord.
Bellario greets your grace.

1071
01:31:07,707 --> 01:31:10,007
Why do you whet your knife so earnestly?

1072
01:31:10,107 --> 01:31:13,137
To cut the forfeiture
from that bankrupt there.

1073
01:31:13,137 --> 01:31:15,007
Can no prayers pierce you?

1074
01:31:15,117 --> 01:31:18,247
No, none that you have
wit enough to make.

1075
01:31:18,347 --> 01:31:23,556
Be you damned, inexecrable dog
and for your life let justice be accused.

1076
01:31:23,666 --> 01:31:26,166
Till you can rail the seal from off my bond,

1077
01:31:26,266 --> 01:31:28,776
you but offend your lungs
to speak so loud.

1078
01:31:30,126 --> 01:31:34,086
Prepare your wit, good youth,
or it will fall to cureless ruin.

1079
01:31:34,196 --> 01:31:36,386
I stand here for law.

1080
01:31:37,846 --> 01:31:41,286
- I stand for law!
- Silence! Silence!

1081
01:31:41,386 --> 01:31:43,266
(Crowd quietens)

1082
01:31:44,416 --> 01:31:49,006
This letter does commend
a young and learned doctor to our court.

1083
01:31:49,106 --> 01:31:51,506
- Well, where is he?
- He attendeth here hard by

1084
01:31:51,606 --> 01:31:53,906
to know your answer,
whether you'll admit him.

1085
01:31:54,006 --> 01:31:56,406
Go, give him
courteous conduct to this place.

1086
01:31:56,506 --> 01:32:00,156
Meantime, the court
shall hear Bellario's letter.

1087
01:32:00,266 --> 01:32:04,646
"Your grace shall understand that
at the receipt of your letter, I am very sick

1088
01:32:04,746 --> 01:32:09,026
"but in the instant your messenger came
there was with me a young doctor of Rome

1089
01:32:09,126 --> 01:32:10,686
"whose name is Balthasar.

1090
01:32:10,796 --> 01:32:13,816
"He comes at my asking to take my place.

1091
01:32:13,816 --> 01:32:17,156
"I beseech you,
let his lack of years be no impediment,

1092
01:32:17,156 --> 01:32:20,386
"for I never knew so young a body
with so old a head.

1093
01:32:20,496 --> 01:32:23,206
"I leave him to your gracious acceptance."

1094
01:32:23,306 --> 01:32:29,566
You heard Bellario, what he writes.
Oh, and here, I take it, is the doctor come.

1095
01:32:31,336 --> 01:32:33,525
You are welcome.

1096
01:32:33,625 --> 01:32:35,715
Take your place.

1097
01:32:37,595 --> 01:32:42,385
Are you acquainted with the difference that
holds this present question in the court?

1098
01:32:42,495 --> 01:32:44,995
I am informed thoroughly of the case.

1099
01:32:45,095 --> 01:32:48,015
Which is the merchant here
and which the Jew?

1100
01:32:48,015 --> 01:32:50,415
Antonio and old Shylock, both stand forth.

1101
01:32:56,775 --> 01:33:02,095
- Is your name Shylock?
- Shylock is my name.

1102
01:33:12,625 --> 01:33:15,755
Of a strange nature is the suit you follow,

1103
01:33:15,755 --> 01:33:20,345
yet in such rule that the Venetian law
cannot deny you as you do proceed.

1104
01:33:22,425 --> 01:33:26,595
- You stand within his power, do you not?
- Ay, so he says.

1105
01:33:26,705 --> 01:33:30,145
- Do you confess the bond?
- I do.

1106
01:33:32,025 --> 01:33:34,945
Then must the Jew be merciful.

1107
01:33:35,985 --> 01:33:39,425
On what compulsion must I? Tell me that.

1108
01:33:39,525 --> 01:33:41,825
The quality of mercy is not strained,

1109
01:33:44,115 --> 01:33:48,604
it droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven
upon the place beneath.

1110
01:33:49,954 --> 01:33:51,934
It is twice blessed -

1111
01:33:52,044 --> 01:33:55,374
It blesseth him that gives
and him that takes.

1112
01:33:56,104 --> 01:33:59,544
'Tis mightiest in the mighty.

1113
01:33:59,654 --> 01:34:04,554
It becomes the throned monarch
better than his crown.

1114
01:34:04,554 --> 01:34:07,894
His sceptre shows the force
of temporal power,

1115
01:34:07,894 --> 01:34:13,934
the attribute to awe and majesty wherein
doth sit the dread and fear of kings.

1116
01:34:15,604 --> 01:34:20,504
But mercy is above this sceptred sway.

1117
01:34:21,964 --> 01:34:25,514
It is enthroned in the heart of kings.

1118
01:34:26,974 --> 01:34:29,784
It is an attribute to God himself

1119
01:34:31,034 --> 01:34:34,584
and earthly power doth then show
likest God's

1120
01:34:34,684 --> 01:34:36,774
when mercy seasons justice.

1121
01:34:40,114 --> 01:34:45,324
Therefore, Jew,
though justice be your plea,

1122
01:34:45,424 --> 01:34:48,974
consider this.

1123
01:34:49,074 --> 01:34:53,144
That in the course of justice,
none of us should see salvation.

1124
01:34:54,394 --> 01:34:56,684
We do pray for mercy

1125
01:34:56,794 --> 01:35:05,033
and that same prayer doth teach us all
to render the deeds of mercy.

1126
01:35:08,053 --> 01:35:12,123
I have spoke thus much
to mitigate the justice of your plea,

1127
01:35:12,123 --> 01:35:16,183
which if you follow
this strict course of Venice

1128
01:35:16,293 --> 01:35:19,313
must needs give sentence
against the merchant there.

1129
01:35:21,613 --> 01:35:24,003
My deeds upon my head.

1130
01:35:25,883 --> 01:35:27,973
I crave the law,

1131
01:35:28,073 --> 01:35:31,413
the penalty and forfeit of my bond.

1132
01:35:32,763 --> 01:35:38,183
- Is he not able to discharge the money?
- Yes, here I tender it for him in court,

1133
01:35:38,293 --> 01:35:39,963
yea, twice the sum.

1134
01:35:40,063 --> 01:35:43,293
If that is not enough,
I will be bound to pay it ten times o'er

1135
01:35:43,403 --> 01:35:45,593
on forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart!

1136
01:35:45,693 --> 01:35:49,973
If this is not enough it must appear
that malice bears down on truth.

1137
01:35:50,073 --> 01:35:52,893
I beseech you,
wrest once the law to your authority -

1138
01:35:52,993 --> 01:35:56,753
To do a great right, do a little wrong
and curb this cruel devil of his will.

1139
01:35:56,853 --> 01:36:01,753
It must not be. There is no power in Venice
can alter a decree established.

1140
01:36:01,753 --> 01:36:03,843
'Twill be recorded for a precedent

1141
01:36:03,943 --> 01:36:07,173
and many an error of the same example
will rush into the state.

1142
01:36:07,283 --> 01:36:11,453
- It cannot be.
- A Daniel come to judgment.

1143
01:36:12,282 --> 01:36:14,472
Yea, a Daniel.

1144
01:36:16,872 --> 01:36:20,002
O wise young judge, how I do honour you.

1145
01:36:20,102 --> 01:36:23,022
I pray you, let me look upon the bond.

1146
01:36:23,862 --> 01:36:27,512
Most reverend doctor, here it is.

1147
01:36:49,192 --> 01:36:54,092
Shylock, there is twice the money
offered you.

1148
01:36:54,202 --> 01:36:56,702
An oath, an oath.

1149
01:36:58,272 --> 01:37:01,192
I have an oath in heaven.

1150
01:37:01,192 --> 01:37:04,312
Shall I lay perjury upon my soul?

1151
01:37:04,422 --> 01:37:07,132
No. Not for Venice.

1152
01:37:11,612 --> 01:37:14,642
Why, this bond is forfeit

1153
01:37:14,742 --> 01:37:18,392
and lawfully at this time
the Jew may claim a pound of flesh

1154
01:37:18,492 --> 01:37:22,462
to be by him cut off
nearest the merchant's heart.

1155
01:37:24,232 --> 01:37:26,001
Be merciful.

1156
01:37:26,111 --> 01:37:29,861
Take twice your money,
bid me tear the bond.

1157
01:37:29,961 --> 01:37:33,411
When it is paid, according to the terms.

1158
01:37:37,261 --> 01:37:40,291
Most heartily I do beseech the court

1159
01:37:42,061 --> 01:37:44,561
to give the judgment.

1160
01:37:50,711 --> 01:37:52,901
(Whispering)

1161
01:38:00,621 --> 01:38:06,981
Then thus it is. You must prepare
your bosom for his knife.

1162
01:38:07,091 --> 01:38:12,091
O noble judge, excellent young man.

1163
01:38:12,191 --> 01:38:16,261
For the intent and purpose of the law
has full relation to the penalty

1164
01:38:16,371 --> 01:38:18,871
which here appeareth due upon the bond.

1165
01:38:18,971 --> 01:38:22,411
'Tis very true, O wise and upright judge.

1166
01:38:22,521 --> 01:38:25,541
How much more elder are you
than you look.

1167
01:38:25,651 --> 01:38:29,401
- Therefore, lay bare your bosom.
- Ay, his breast.

1168
01:38:29,501 --> 01:38:32,741
So says the bond, does it not,
noble judge?

1169
01:38:32,841 --> 01:38:35,131
Nearest the heart.

1170
01:38:35,241 --> 01:38:38,160
- Those are the very words.
- It is so.

1171
01:38:40,040 --> 01:38:42,540
Are there balances here
to weigh the flesh?

1172
01:38:42,640 --> 01:38:46,500
I have them here.

1173
01:39:04,540 --> 01:39:06,940
Have by some surgeon, Shylock,
on your charge

1174
01:39:07,040 --> 01:39:11,110
to stop his wounds
lest he should bleed to death.

1175
01:39:12,990 --> 01:39:15,700
Is it so nominated in the bond?

1176
01:39:16,630 --> 01:39:21,220
It is not so expressed but what of that?
'Twere good you do so much for charity.

1177
01:39:21,330 --> 01:39:25,290
I cannot find it. 'Tis not in the bond.

1178
01:39:31,340 --> 01:39:34,670
You, merchant, have you anything to say?

1179
01:39:35,720 --> 01:39:37,380
But little.

1180
01:39:41,240 --> 01:39:43,430
I am armed and well prepared.

1181
01:39:46,040 --> 01:39:49,060
Give me your hand, Bassanio.

1182
01:39:53,859 --> 01:39:56,359
Fare thee well.

1183
01:39:57,509 --> 01:40:00,219
Grieve not that I am fallen to this for you.

1184
01:40:01,679 --> 01:40:05,959
For herein doth Fortune show herself
more kind than is her custom.

1185
01:40:06,059 --> 01:40:09,709
Commend me to thy honourable wife.

1186
01:40:11,479 --> 01:40:13,979
Tell her the process of Antonio's end.

1187
01:40:17,109 --> 01:40:21,699
Say how I loved you,
speak me fair in death.

1188
01:40:23,369 --> 01:40:25,769
And when the tale is told,

1189
01:40:25,769 --> 01:40:29,729
bid her be judge
whether Bassanio had not once a love.

1190
01:40:31,609 --> 01:40:35,049
Repent but you
that you shall lose your friend

1191
01:40:36,609 --> 01:40:39,839
and you repent not that he pays your debt.

1192
01:40:41,299 --> 01:40:44,849
For if the Jew do cut but deep enough

1193
01:40:44,949 --> 01:40:48,389
I'll pay it instantly with all my heart.

1194
01:40:51,309 --> 01:40:56,109
Antonio, I am married to a wife

1195
01:40:57,469 --> 01:41:01,429
which is as dear to me as life itself.

1196
01:41:01,529 --> 01:41:06,848
But life itself, my wife and all the world

1197
01:41:06,848 --> 01:41:10,918
are not with me esteemed above your life.

1198
01:41:13,108 --> 01:41:18,738
I would lose all, ay, sacrifice them all,
here to this devil

1199
01:41:20,088 --> 01:41:22,278
to deliver you.

1200
01:41:23,528 --> 01:41:27,808
I have a wife, whom, I protest, I love -

1201
01:41:27,908 --> 01:41:32,918
I would she were in heaven,
so she could entreat some power

1202
01:41:33,018 --> 01:41:34,688
to change this cursed Jew!

1203
01:41:34,788 --> 01:41:37,508
I have a daughter!

1204
01:41:38,438 --> 01:41:42,298
Would that any of the stock of Barrabas
been her husband

1205
01:41:42,298 --> 01:41:45,218
rather than a Christian.

1206
01:41:45,328 --> 01:41:50,228
We trifle time. I pray you, pursue sentence.

1207
01:41:52,098 --> 01:41:54,088
You may proceed.

1208
01:41:55,228 --> 01:41:59,398
A pound of that same
merchant's flesh is yours.

1209
01:41:59,508 --> 01:42:03,678
The court awards it
and the law does give it.

1210
01:42:03,778 --> 01:42:04,828
Most rightful judge.

1211
01:42:04,928 --> 01:42:08,678
And you must cut this flesh
from off his breast.

1212
01:42:08,788 --> 01:42:12,958
The court awards it and the law allows it.

1213
01:42:13,058 --> 01:42:14,938
Most learned judge.

1214
01:42:15,977 --> 01:42:18,067
A sentence.

1215
01:42:19,627 --> 01:42:20,877
Come.

1216
01:42:22,547 --> 01:42:24,117
Prepare.

1217
01:42:58,627 --> 01:43:01,647
- Tarry a little!
- Aah!

1218
01:43:04,047 --> 01:43:06,237
There is something else.

1219
01:43:08,847 --> 01:43:13,327
This bond does give you here
no drop of blood.

1220
01:43:14,577 --> 01:43:18,857
The words expressly are a pound of flesh.

1221
01:43:21,147 --> 01:43:24,587
Take then your bond,
take then your pound of flesh,

1222
01:43:24,697 --> 01:43:30,116
but in the cutting of it,
if you do shed one drop of Christian blood,

1223
01:43:32,616 --> 01:43:36,786
your lands and goods
are by the laws of Venice confiscate

1224
01:43:36,786 --> 01:43:38,456
unto the state of Venice.

1225
01:43:38,566 --> 01:43:40,646
O upright judge!

1226
01:43:40,756 --> 01:43:43,986
Mark, Jew. Learned judge!

1227
01:43:45,966 --> 01:43:48,256
Is that the law?

1228
01:43:48,366 --> 01:43:51,076
Yourself shall see the act.

1229
01:43:51,176 --> 01:43:53,996
For as you urge on justice,

1230
01:43:54,096 --> 01:43:58,586
be assured you shall have justice
more than you desire.

1231
01:44:05,356 --> 01:44:06,926
Well.

1232
01:44:09,426 --> 01:44:12,556
I take the offer, then.

1233
01:44:15,576 --> 01:44:17,666
Pay the bond twice

1234
01:44:17,666 --> 01:44:19,956
and let the Christian go.

1235
01:44:20,896 --> 01:44:25,176
- Here is the money.
- Soft. The Jew shall have all justice.

1236
01:44:25,276 --> 01:44:29,026
No haste. He shall have nothing
but the penalty.

1237
01:44:29,136 --> 01:44:31,426
(Crowd murmurs)

1238
01:44:31,426 --> 01:44:34,246
Therefore, prepare you to cut off the flesh.

1239
01:44:35,386 --> 01:44:37,476
Shed then no blood

1240
01:44:37,576 --> 01:44:43,315
nor cut you less nor more
but just a pound of flesh.

1241
01:44:43,315 --> 01:44:46,025
If you take more or less than a just pound

1242
01:44:46,125 --> 01:44:48,835
be it but so much
as makes it light or heavy

1243
01:44:48,945 --> 01:44:53,945
in the substance or division
of the twentieth part of one poor scruple,

1244
01:44:53,945 --> 01:44:59,375
nay, if the scale do turn
but in the estimation of a hair,

1245
01:45:01,665 --> 01:45:03,755
you die

1246
01:45:03,855 --> 01:45:06,565
and all your goods are confiscate.

1247
01:45:06,675 --> 01:45:09,795
- (Gratiano) A second Daniel!
- (Laughter)

1248
01:45:09,905 --> 01:45:13,035
Now, infidel, I have you on the hip!

1249
01:45:13,135 --> 01:45:15,425
Why does the Jew pause?

1250
01:45:17,305 --> 01:45:21,895
Shall I not have even my principal?

1251
01:45:21,995 --> 01:45:26,165
You shall have nothing but your forfeiture,
to be so taken at your peril, Jew.

1252
01:45:27,625 --> 01:45:30,445
Why, then the devil give him good of it.

1253
01:45:30,545 --> 01:45:33,055
- I'll stay no longer question.
- Tarry, Jew.

1254
01:45:33,155 --> 01:45:36,175
The law has yet another hold on you.

1255
01:45:36,805 --> 01:45:39,305
It is enacted in the laws of Venice,

1256
01:45:39,415 --> 01:45:45,255
if it be proved against an alien
that by direct or indirect attempts

1257
01:45:45,255 --> 01:45:47,335
he seek the life of any citizen,

1258
01:45:47,445 --> 01:45:52,445
the party 'gainst which he does contrive
shall seize one half of his goods.

1259
01:45:52,555 --> 01:45:57,554
The other half comes
to the privy coffer of the state

1260
01:45:57,654 --> 01:46:04,854
and the offender's life
lies in the mercy of the Duke only,

1261
01:46:04,954 --> 01:46:07,254
'gainst all other voice.

1262
01:46:15,484 --> 01:46:17,994
In which predicament, I say you stand.

1263
01:46:21,434 --> 01:46:23,724
Down, therefore,

1264
01:46:26,854 --> 01:46:29,984
and beg mercy of the Duke.

1265
01:46:41,874 --> 01:46:45,624
Beg that you may have leave
to hang yourself.

1266
01:46:48,644 --> 01:46:53,234
(Duke) That you shall see the difference
in our spirit, I pardon you your life

1267
01:46:53,344 --> 01:46:55,114
before you ask it.

1268
01:46:55,214 --> 01:47:00,844
For half your wealth, it is Antonio's, the
other half shall come to the general state.

1269
01:47:04,914 --> 01:47:09,183
Nay, take my life and all -

1270
01:47:09,293 --> 01:47:11,373
Pardon not that.

1271
01:47:13,043 --> 01:47:19,303
You take my house when you take the prop
that doth sustain my house.

1272
01:47:21,183 --> 01:47:25,033
You take my life

1273
01:47:25,143 --> 01:47:28,483
when you take the means whereby I live.

1274
01:47:30,143 --> 01:47:32,443
What mercy can you render him, Antonio?

1275
01:47:32,543 --> 01:47:35,883
A halter gratis,
nothing else, for God's sake.

1276
01:47:36,923 --> 01:47:43,703
So please my lord the Duke
and all the court

1277
01:47:45,893 --> 01:47:48,703
forego the fine of one half of his goods.

1278
01:47:49,853 --> 01:47:55,383
I am content so he will let me use
the other half, in trust,

1279
01:47:57,673 --> 01:47:59,973
relinquish it upon his death

1280
01:48:01,433 --> 01:48:05,603
unto the gentleman
that lately stole his daughter.

1281
01:48:08,933 --> 01:48:11,753
One thing provided more,
that, for this favour,

1282
01:48:14,153 --> 01:48:17,073
he shall presently become a Christian.

1283
01:48:21,132 --> 01:48:23,432
(Contained sobbing)

1284
01:48:29,682 --> 01:48:33,232
(Duke) He shall do this
or else I do recant the pardon

1285
01:48:33,332 --> 01:48:36,152
I late pronounced here.

1286
01:48:43,552 --> 01:48:45,842
(Portia) Are you contented, Jew?

1287
01:48:53,252 --> 01:48:55,442
What do you say?

1288
01:48:55,542 --> 01:48:57,422
Oh...

1289
01:48:58,362 --> 01:49:00,342
I am contented.

1290
01:49:00,442 --> 01:49:05,142
Clerk, prepare a deed of gift.

1291
01:49:07,642 --> 01:49:11,392
I pray you, give me leave to go from hence.

1292
01:49:11,502 --> 01:49:14,622
I... I am not well.

1293
01:49:16,292 --> 01:49:20,782
I will... Send a deed after me
and I will sign it.

1294
01:49:20,882 --> 01:49:23,702
Get you gone, then, but do it.

1295
01:49:30,062 --> 01:49:32,142
Court dismissed.

1296
01:50:13,851 --> 01:50:16,981
- Most worthy gentleman,

1297
01:50:17,081 --> 01:50:19,481
I and my friend have by your wisdom

1298
01:50:19,481 --> 01:50:22,711
been this day acquitted
of most grievous penalties,

1299
01:50:22,821 --> 01:50:27,301
in lieu whereof, three thousand ducats,
due unto the Jew

1300
01:50:27,411 --> 01:50:29,911
we freely pay your courteous pains withal.

1301
01:50:30,011 --> 01:50:33,971
- Mm.
- And stand indebted, over and above,

1302
01:50:34,081 --> 01:50:36,791
in love and service to you ever more.

1303
01:50:38,251 --> 01:50:40,541
He is well paid that is well satisfied

1304
01:50:40,651 --> 01:50:42,731
and I, delivering you, am satisfied

1305
01:50:42,841 --> 01:50:46,170
and therein do account myself well paid -
fare you well.

1306
01:50:46,170 --> 01:50:48,890
Dear sir, of force
I must attempt you further.

1307
01:50:49,720 --> 01:50:53,680
Take some remembrance of us,
as a tribute, not as a fee.

1308
01:50:54,830 --> 01:50:56,810
Run me two things, I pray you.

1309
01:50:56,910 --> 01:51:00,250
Not to deny me and to pardon me.

1310
01:51:03,380 --> 01:51:05,670
You press me far, therefore I will yield.

1311
01:51:10,160 --> 01:51:15,480
Give me your gloves.
I'll wear them for your sake.

1312
01:51:16,620 --> 01:51:21,000
And for your love,
I'll take this ring from you.

1313
01:51:21,110 --> 01:51:25,170
Do not draw back your hand,
I'll take no more,

1314
01:51:25,280 --> 01:51:28,200
and you, in love, shall not deny me this.

1315
01:51:28,300 --> 01:51:32,780
This ring... Good sir, alas, it is a trifle,
I would not shame myself to give you this.

1316
01:51:32,890 --> 01:51:35,290
I will have nothing else but only this.

1317
01:51:35,390 --> 01:51:39,870
There's more depends on this
than on the value.

1318
01:51:39,980 --> 01:51:44,460
The dearest ring in all of Venice will I give
to you, and find it out by proclamation,

1319
01:51:44,570 --> 01:51:47,280
only for this, I pray you, pardon me.

1320
01:51:49,160 --> 01:51:50,820
Oh, I see, sir.

1321
01:51:50,930 --> 01:51:54,790
You are liberal in offers,
you taught me first to beg,

1322
01:51:54,890 --> 01:51:58,749
and now methinks you teach me
how a beggar should be answered.

1323
01:51:58,849 --> 01:52:01,669
This ring was given me by my wife.

1324
01:52:01,769 --> 01:52:03,539
Oh!

1325
01:52:03,539 --> 01:52:08,449
And when she put it on she made me vow
that I should neither sell nor give

1326
01:52:09,489 --> 01:52:11,049
nor lose it.

1327
01:52:11,049 --> 01:52:13,869
That 'scuse serves many men
to save their gifts

1328
01:52:13,969 --> 01:52:16,159
and if your wife be not a madwoman,

1329
01:52:16,269 --> 01:52:19,599
then know her well
I have deserved this ring.

1330
01:52:19,599 --> 01:52:23,459
She would not hold out enemy forever
for giving it to me.

1331
01:52:23,559 --> 01:52:26,279
My lord Bassanio, let him have the ring.

1332
01:52:26,379 --> 01:52:29,199
Let not his deserving and my love as well

1333
01:52:29,299 --> 01:52:32,319
be valued 'gainst
your wife's commandment.

1334
01:52:42,329 --> 01:52:46,709
Enquire the Jew's house out.
Give him this deed and let him sign it.

1335
01:52:46,819 --> 01:52:52,029
Ho! My lord Bassanio upon more advice
has sent you here this ring.

1336
01:52:52,139 --> 01:52:54,319
He does entreat your company at dinner.

1337
01:52:55,469 --> 01:52:57,559
That cannot be.

1338
01:52:57,659 --> 01:53:03,079
His ring I do accept most thankfully.

1339
01:53:04,439 --> 01:53:06,629
I pray you tell him.

1340
01:53:07,459 --> 01:53:11,838
Furthermore, I pray you show my youth
to old Shylock's house.

1341
01:53:11,948 --> 01:53:14,758
That will I do.

1342
01:53:14,868 --> 01:53:20,288
I'll see if I can get my husband's ring which
I did make him swear to keep forever.

1343
01:53:40,198 --> 01:53:43,748
(# Countertenor singing)

1344
01:53:54,278 --> 01:53:56,578
(Lorenzo) Dear ladies, welcome home.

1345
01:53:56,578 --> 01:53:59,598
(Portia) We have been praying
for our husbands' welfare,

1346
01:53:59,698 --> 01:54:03,348
whose speed
we hope the better for our words.

1347
01:54:23,888 --> 01:54:27,437
This night, methinks,
is but the daylight sick.

1348
01:54:27,537 --> 01:54:29,627
It looks a little paler.

1349
01:54:31,187 --> 01:54:35,357
'Tis a day such as the day is
when the sun is hid.

1350
01:54:35,467 --> 01:54:38,077
- Ho!
- Peace.

1351
01:54:44,437 --> 01:54:46,827
You're welcome home, my lord.

1352
01:54:46,827 --> 01:54:50,477
I thank you, madam.
Give welcome to my friend.

1353
01:54:50,587 --> 01:54:54,027
This is the man, this is Antonio
to whom I am so infinitely bound.

1354
01:54:54,127 --> 01:54:56,947
You should in all sense
be much bound to him,

1355
01:54:57,047 --> 01:54:59,347
for as I hear he was much bound for you.

1356
01:54:59,447 --> 01:55:01,947
No more than I am well acquitted of.

1357
01:55:03,517 --> 01:55:06,227
Sir, you are welcome to our house.

1358
01:55:06,227 --> 01:55:12,067
It must appear in other ways than words
so I cut short this breathing courtesy.

1359
01:55:19,987 --> 01:55:23,847
By yonder moon,
I swear you do me wrong.

1360
01:55:23,957 --> 01:55:26,557
In faith I gave it to the judge's clerk.

1361
01:55:26,667 --> 01:55:29,057
Would he were gelded
that had it, for my part,

1362
01:55:29,167 --> 01:55:31,567
since you do take it, love,
so much at heart.

1363
01:55:31,667 --> 01:55:34,067
A quarrel, ho, already? What's the matter?

1364
01:55:34,167 --> 01:55:38,336
About a hoop of gold,
a paltry ring that she did give me,

1365
01:55:38,336 --> 01:55:43,976
whose motto was for all the world
like cutler's poetry upon a knife.

1366
01:55:43,976 --> 01:55:46,996
"Love me and leave me not."

1367
01:55:47,096 --> 01:55:49,916
What talk you of the motto
or the value?

1368
01:55:50,016 --> 01:55:52,526
You swore to me when I did give it you

1369
01:55:52,626 --> 01:55:55,336
that you would wear it
till your hour of death

1370
01:55:55,446 --> 01:55:58,676
and that it should lie with you
in your grave.

1371
01:55:58,776 --> 01:56:01,596
Though not for me
yet for your vehement oaths

1372
01:56:01,696 --> 01:56:05,136
you should have been respective
and have kept it.

1373
01:56:05,246 --> 01:56:09,726
- Gave it to a judge's clerk!
- I gave it to a youth,

1374
01:56:09,826 --> 01:56:14,736
a kind of boy, a little scrubbed boy,
no higher than thyself, the judge's clerk.

1375
01:56:14,836 --> 01:56:17,966
You were to blame,
I must be plain with you,

1376
01:56:18,066 --> 01:56:21,196
to part so slightly with your wife's first gift.

1377
01:56:22,236 --> 01:56:26,826
I gave my love a ring
and made him swear never to part with it.

1378
01:56:26,936 --> 01:56:29,126
And here he stands.

1379
01:56:30,996 --> 01:56:34,546
I dare be sworn for him,
he would not lose it

1380
01:56:34,646 --> 01:56:39,966
nor pluck it from his finger
for all the wealth that the world masters.

1381
01:56:40,066 --> 01:56:45,286
Why, I were best to cut my left hand off
and swear I lost the ring defending it.

1382
01:56:45,386 --> 01:56:47,786
- My lord Bassanio gave his ring away.
- Hm?

1383
01:56:47,886 --> 01:56:51,435
Unto the judge that begged it
and indeed deserved it, too.

1384
01:56:53,835 --> 01:56:58,215
And then the boy, his clerk, that took
some pain in writing, he begged mine

1385
01:56:58,315 --> 01:57:02,385
and neither man nor master
would take aught but the two rings.

1386
01:57:04,055 --> 01:57:06,445
If I could add a lie onto a fault
I would deny it

1387
01:57:06,555 --> 01:57:12,605
but you see my finger
has not the ring upon it, it is... gone.

1388
01:57:12,705 --> 01:57:18,235
Even so void is your false heart of truth.

1389
01:57:20,835 --> 01:57:24,385
By heaven, I will ne'er come into your bed
until I see the ring.

1390
01:57:24,485 --> 01:57:26,885
Nor I in yours till I again see mine.

1391
01:57:28,345 --> 01:57:33,665
Sweet Portia, if you did know
to whom I gave the ring,

1392
01:57:33,765 --> 01:57:36,065
if you did know for whom I gave the ring,

1393
01:57:36,165 --> 01:57:38,565
and would conceive
for what I gave the ring

1394
01:57:38,665 --> 01:57:44,615
and how unwillingly I left the ring when
nought would be accepted but the ring,

1395
01:57:44,715 --> 01:57:48,365
you would abate the strength
of your displeasure.

1396
01:57:48,475 --> 01:57:53,165
If you had known the virtue of the ring

1397
01:57:55,355 --> 01:57:58,685
or half her worthiness
who did give the ring,

1398
01:57:58,795 --> 01:58:02,335
or your own honour to contain the ring,

1399
01:58:02,445 --> 01:58:06,304
you would not then
have parted with the ring.

1400
01:58:06,404 --> 01:58:08,804
Nerissa teaches me what to believe.

1401
01:58:08,904 --> 01:58:11,414
I'll die for it but some woman has that ring.

1402
01:58:11,514 --> 01:58:15,374
No, by honour, madam,
by my soul, no woman had it

1403
01:58:15,474 --> 01:58:17,454
but a civil doctor,

1404
01:58:17,564 --> 01:58:21,004
which did refuse three thousand ducats
of me and begged the ring

1405
01:58:21,104 --> 01:58:24,344
the which I did refuse him,
and suffered him, displeased, to go away,

1406
01:58:24,344 --> 01:58:28,924
even he that had held up
the very life of my dear friend.

1407
01:58:29,034 --> 01:58:31,954
What should I say, sweet lady?

1408
01:58:35,704 --> 01:58:37,584
I was enforced to send it after him.

1409
01:58:37,684 --> 01:58:40,184
Let not that doctor come near my house.

1410
01:58:40,294 --> 01:58:46,754
Since he has got the jewel that I loved and
that which you did swear to keep for me,

1411
01:58:46,864 --> 01:58:51,554
I will become as liberal as you -

1412
01:58:51,654 --> 01:58:55,104
I'll not deny him anything I have.

1413
01:58:55,204 --> 01:58:59,484
No, not since my body,
nor my husband's bed,

1414
01:58:59,584 --> 01:59:01,664
know him I shall, I am sure of that.

1415
01:59:01,774 --> 01:59:05,424
Portia, forgive me this enforced wrong

1416
01:59:05,524 --> 01:59:11,364
and in the hearing of these many friends,
I swear to you, even by thine own fair eyes,

1417
01:59:11,474 --> 01:59:14,704
I never more will break an oath with thee.

1418
01:59:14,804 --> 01:59:18,043
(Antonio) I once did lend my body
for his wealth.

1419
01:59:18,143 --> 01:59:22,313
I dare be bound again,
my soul upon the forfeit,

1420
01:59:23,563 --> 01:59:26,173
that your lord...

1421
01:59:28,783 --> 01:59:31,903
will never more break faith advisedly.

1422
01:59:33,573 --> 01:59:38,063
Then you shall be his surety.

1423
01:59:39,203 --> 01:59:41,293
Give him this.

1424
01:59:41,393 --> 01:59:45,773
- And bid him keep it better

1425
01:59:45,883 --> 01:59:48,173
than the other.

1426
01:59:51,823 --> 01:59:55,053
My lord Bassanio, swear to keep this ring.

1427
02:00:02,663 --> 02:00:06,523
By heaven, 'tis the same I gave the doctor.

1428
02:00:06,633 --> 02:00:10,073
I had it of him. Pardon me, Bassanio,

1429
02:00:12,263 --> 02:00:16,223
for, by this ring, the doctor lay with me.

1430
02:00:16,323 --> 02:00:20,293
And pardon me, my gentle Gratiano,

1431
02:00:20,393 --> 02:00:23,313
for that same scrubbed boy,
the doctor's clerk,

1432
02:00:23,413 --> 02:00:27,173
in lieu of this last night did lie with me.

1433
02:00:31,862 --> 02:00:33,012
Why...

1434
02:00:34,882 --> 02:00:38,742
This is like
the mending of the highways in summer,

1435
02:00:38,852 --> 02:00:42,182
when the ways are fair enough.

1436
02:00:44,792 --> 02:00:49,172
What, are we cuckolds
ere we have deserved it?

1437
02:00:49,272 --> 02:00:51,362
Speak not so grossly.

1438
02:00:52,712 --> 02:00:54,592
You are all amazed.

1439
02:00:56,262 --> 02:00:58,872
Bassanio...

1440
02:00:58,972 --> 02:01:03,982
Here is a letter,
it comes from Padua, from old Bellario.

1441
02:01:08,252 --> 02:01:13,672
There you shall read
that Portia was the doctor,

1442
02:01:15,452 --> 02:01:17,642
Nerissa there her clerk.

1443
02:01:18,892 --> 02:01:22,332
Lorenzo here shall witness
I set forth as soon as you

1444
02:01:22,432 --> 02:01:24,522
and only just now returned.

1445
02:01:31,612 --> 02:01:36,092
Were you the doctor and I knew you not?

1446
02:01:41,312 --> 02:01:45,371
Were you the clerk
that is to make me a cuckold?

1447
02:01:45,481 --> 02:01:51,521
Ay, but the clerk that never means to do it
unless he live to be a man.

1448
02:01:54,961 --> 02:01:57,051
Sweet doctor,

1449
02:01:58,411 --> 02:02:00,391
you shall be my bedfellow.

1450
02:02:01,431 --> 02:02:05,081
When I am absent, then lie with my wife.

1451
02:02:12,481 --> 02:02:14,881
How now, Lorenzo?

1452
02:02:14,991 --> 02:02:18,431
My clerk has some good comforts too
for you.

1453
02:02:18,531 --> 02:02:24,681
Ay, there do I give to you and Jessica
from the rich Jew

1454
02:02:24,791 --> 02:02:30,521
a special deed of gift after his death
of all he dies possessed of.

1455
02:02:30,631 --> 02:02:32,611
Oh!

1456
02:02:33,751 --> 02:02:38,031
Fair ladies, you drop manna
in the way of starved people.

1457
02:02:42,831 --> 02:02:46,061
It is almost morning

1458
02:02:46,061 --> 02:02:52,111
and yet, I am sure you are not satisfied
with these events at full.

1459
02:02:55,030 --> 02:02:56,690
Let us go in.

1460
02:02:58,360 --> 02:03:01,390
And I will answer all things faithfully.

1461
02:03:10,670 --> 02:03:12,860
Well, let it be so.

1462
02:03:14,630 --> 02:03:18,070
The first inter'gatory
that my Nerissa shall be sworn on is

1463
02:03:18,170 --> 02:03:22,550
whether till the next night
she had rather stay or go to bed now,

1464
02:03:22,660 --> 02:03:24,640
being two hours today.

1465
02:03:24,740 --> 02:03:27,250
But were the day come,
I should wish it dark

1466
02:03:27,350 --> 02:03:30,060
till I were couching the doctor's clerk.

1467
02:03:30,890 --> 02:03:37,780
Well, while I live I'll fear no other thing
so sore as keeping safe Nerissa's ring.

1468
02:03:30,917 --> 02:03:37,716
Well, while I live I'll fear no other thing
so sore as keeping safe Nerissa's ring.

1469
02:03:41,011 --> 02:03:49,020
The world was all before them

1470
02:03:49,103 --> 02:03:56,402
Ah

1471
02:03:56,486 --> 02:04:04,537
Where to choose their place of rest

1472
02:04:04,620 --> 02:04:11,586
Ah

1473
02:04:12,379 --> 02:04:16,216
And Providence their guide

1474
02:04:16,341 --> 02:04:20,095
They hand in hand

1475
02:04:20,178 --> 02:04:27,728
Took their wand'ring steps

1476
02:04:27,854 --> 02:04:31,775
And slow

1477
02:04:31,859 --> 02:04:35,904
Through Eden

1478
02:04:35,988 --> 02:04:43,121
Took their solitary way

1479
02:04:43,580 --> 02:04:49,085
Ah...

1480
02:05:50,402 --> 02:05:55,115
The ring is on my hand

1481
02:05:55,199 --> 02:05:59,830
And the wreath is on my brow

1482
02:05:59,913 --> 02:06:04,209
Satin and jewels grand

1483
02:06:04,960 --> 02:06:10,299
Are all at my command

1484
02:06:10,383 --> 02:06:16,472
And I am happy now

1485
02:06:20,769 --> 02:06:25,232
And my lord, he loves me well

1486
02:06:25,315 --> 02:06:29,153
But when first he breathed his vow

1487
02:06:29,236 --> 02:06:33,199
I felt my bosom swell

1488
02:06:33,283 --> 02:06:37,620
For the words rang as a knell

1489
02:06:37,704 --> 02:06:41,875
And the voice seemed his who fell

1490
02:06:41,958 --> 02:06:46,172
In the battle down the dell

1491
02:06:46,255 --> 02:06:52,094
And who is happy now

1492
02:06:54,431 --> 02:06:58,727
But he spoke to reassure me

1493
02:06:58,810 --> 02:07:02,981
And he kissed my pallid brow

1494
02:07:03,064 --> 02:07:06,903
While a reverie came o'er me

1495
02:07:07,862 --> 02:07:11,240
And to the churchyard bore me

1496
02:07:11,324 --> 02:07:15,245
And I sighed to him before me

1497
02:07:16,079 --> 02:07:19,583
Thinking him dead D'Elormie

1498
02:07:19,708 --> 02:07:24,755
"Oh, I am happy now!"

1499
02:07:45,528 --> 02:07:47,656
Ah...

1500
02:08:02,088 --> 02:08:07,635
And I am happy now

1501
02:08:10,097 --> 02:08:14,476
And thus the words were spoken

1502
02:08:14,560 --> 02:08:18,397
And this the plighted vow

1503
02:08:18,522 --> 02:08:22,402
And though my faith be broken

1504
02:08:22,485 --> 02:08:26,906
And though my heart be broken

1505
02:08:26,990 --> 02:08:31,035
Here is a ring, as token

1506
02:08:31,120 --> 02:08:36,792
That I am happy now

1507
02:08:39,461 --> 02:08:43,925
Would God I could awaken

1508
02:08:44,009 --> 02:08:47,429
For I dream I know not how

1509
02:08:47,554 --> 02:08:51,933
And my soul is sorely shaken

1510
02:08:52,017 --> 02:08:55,938
Lest an evil step be taken

1511
02:08:56,022 --> 02:09:00,485
Lest the dead who is forsaken

1512
02:09:00,568 --> 02:09:06,116
May not be happy now

1513
02:09:09,203 --> 02:09:13,790
Ah...
