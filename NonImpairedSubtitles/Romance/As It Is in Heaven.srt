00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,309
A film by Kay Pollak

2
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:33,354
As it is in Heaven.

3
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:06,437
My dear, sweet, Daniel. . .

4
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,395
You never have to be afraid
of those boys, ever again .

5
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:17,869
We won't go on living here.
I'll find you another school.

6
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:24,269
Pappa would have supported me
in this, if he had been alive.

7
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,758
Everything is for the best.

8
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:33,238
just believe that,
and all will be fine.

9
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,479
When I grow up I'm going
to marry you, mommy.

10
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,788
Ever since I was a little boy
I had a dream to create music-

11
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,310
-that would open people's hearts.

12
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,193
That was my dream.

13
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,832
At 1 4, I was to compete at the
Junior Soloist World Championships.

14
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,918
A day I will always remember.

15
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:39,349
Please! Make way, please!

16
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,551
One thing was new. . .

17
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:01,834
For the first time in my life
my calendar was completely empty.

18
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,713
The doctor said it was a heart
attack.

19
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:14,833
It wasn't fatal, but he didn't
give me much hope.

20
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,874
He said.:
''Your heart's completely worn out. ''

21
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,599
Jump, Daniel.! Jump.!

22
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:55,109
I don't know why I returned
to the village of my childhood.

23
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:59,438
Sometimes you do things
without knowing why.

24
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:31,152
I reckoned that no one in the village
would know that I'd once lived here.

25
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,911
My agent had given me a new name
when I was 1 5.

26
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:17,112
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

27
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:09,637
''Remember to let the tap run
before drinking. ''

28
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:14,118
''The water comes from our own well. ''

29
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:20,790
I heard. . .you'd bought
the old school here.

30
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,312
I thought I'd drop by.

31
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:32,789
I'm Stig Berggren, the village Pastor.

32
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,675
I wanted to be the first
to welcome you .

33
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:43,638
It's my little custom to give
each newcomer a Bible.

34
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:48,957
In the name of Jesus Christ.

35
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:52,232
Thank you .

36
00:10:54,480 --> 00:11:00,999
I arrived 2 5 years ago and
we ended up staying, my wife and I.

37
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:12,909
Just think, Daniel Daréus
here in our old school.

38
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,671
But one can only wonder,
what will you do here?

39
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:22,271
-I shall listen .
-I see. . .

40
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:29,910
My wife Inger and I wonder if you'd
care to come to our home for dinner.

41
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,157
Thank you, but I prefer to be alone.

42
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,395
Perhaps he could hold a concert
here in the village.

43
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,068
I've stopped performing!

44
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:50,870
Though the church
is really very beautiful.

45
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,309
There's Conny from the garage
with my gun .

46
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:08,639
I saw your car, and thought. . .

47
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:15,596
Here's your gun.
I've checked it out, it works fine now.

48
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:19,793
-I welded the barrel .
-Thank you so much.

49
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:29,349
Was that you in the taxi? That was me
who skidded past in the truck.

50
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:36,308
It's a she. . .
Bulls-eye, right up her ass.

51
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:44,511
-My Christmas hare for the church .
-Thank you!

52
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:49,032
He's a conductor. World famous.
Daniel Daréus.

53
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,071
One of those artist types, huh?

54
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,878
-Has Olga laughed today?
-What?

55
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,719
Isn't your hearing aid on?

56
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:58,790
-Has Olga laughed today?
-What have you got today, Lena?

57
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:05,269
This Norwegian and a Swede
are watching a funeral procession.

58
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,119
The Swede asks:
''Who's the dead one?''

59
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:14,031
''Don't know'', says the Norwegian,
''but I think that's him in the coffin .''

60
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:27,118
-I'll put down the 65 crowns.
-Fine. Bye.

61
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:47,119
Are you the one who bought
the old school?

62
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:50,232
Yes.

63
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:54,831
I knew you'd come in here.
Everyone has to eat.

64
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:05,592
Would you listen to this?
See if it's good enough.

65
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,032
Want a Bingo lottery ticket?

66
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:21,676
Everyone plays ''bingolotto''
around here. We had a winner once.

67
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,515
This is for you .

68
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,635
Sure, we can handle
just about anything . See ya!

69
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:57,118
He wanted a bottle of jamaican,
only thing that turns his girl on.

70
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:03,793
Check it out. 24 speeds. Only 5,800
crowns. A lot of bike for your buck.

71
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:09,635
Nothing wrong with buying a bike
in the winter. Don't let that. . .

72
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:19,230
-Eeh . . . nothing with fewer gears?
-C'mon, don't be cheap with yourself.

73
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,479
People around here can be
a bit narrow minded .

74
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,797
I've always driven Yank cars.

75
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,152
I love the purr of an old V8,
the smooth ride.

76
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:36,434
Folks get pretty bent out of shape
over those wheels.

77
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:42,636
But you can't let it get to you .
Come spring thaw, out for a drive!

78
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,949
-5,200, huh?
-Well?

79
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:59,958
Listen, I'd like to show you something
you could really help me out with.

80
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:05,518
Now this is very dear to me.
We've got a choir in the village-

81
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:10,555
-that meets every Thursday
in the congregation hall .

82
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:16,869
We do a spring concert and
you're just the man to come and. . .

83
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:23,315
-No, no, I'm too impatient.
-just to brush us up a little.

84
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:28,116
Offer some good advice.
You aren't cheap in that way?

85
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:33,953
-4,600.
-I just came here to listen . . .

86
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,358
Great! Come on Thursday, to listen .
Just to listen.

87
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:45,477
4,200 and a sweatsuit thrown in .
See you on Thursday.

88
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:50,629
Prepare! The Lord is coming
Hills, sink! And valleys, rise!

89
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:55,677
-But I'm the one who runs this choir!
-Siv, he's only coming to listen .

90
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,917
-What's his name?
-Daniel Daréus.

91
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:03,875
Typical Arne, giving out orders.
I'm in charge of the choir.

92
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,231
He's only going to listen .
We're rehearsing any way.

93
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,318
You're only in charge, Siv
because we don't have a cantor.

94
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:14,479
-Does Stig know about this?
-The Pastor has nothing to do with it!

95
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:20,391
-It's all Arne's delusions of grandeur!
-What's the problem?

96
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,558
He's just going to listen
and give a little advice.

97
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:28,072
-Musicians aren't cheap in that way. . .
-Arne, simmer down.

98
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:32,114
Well, if he's coming,
of course we should sing!

99
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,199
I'm not going to sing, neither is Olga .

100
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,029
Olga's old enough
to make her own decisions.

101
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:46,918
Siv, come on . You need a fella .
Maybe he's something for you .

102
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,908
As far as I know, he's single.

103
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,389
Oh, stop it!

104
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:17,671
No, don't worry.

105
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:23,400
I'll be there when you get home.

106
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,672
Yes, dinner's ready.

107
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,438
But you said I could go.
I'll be home when you get there.

108
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,270
Welcome.

109
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:50,230
I'm Gabriella .

110
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:53,193
Come on in.

111
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:09,231
Glories stream from heaven afar

112
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:16,755
Heavenly host sing Alleluia

113
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:22,557
Christ the savior is born

114
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:42,470
I was passing by and heard singing.

115
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:45,797
Much of it is very nice.

116
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:53,954
-We are not pros.
-But we could be much better.

117
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:59,598
-Well, within our limitations.
-I dreamt he would come.

118
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:09,792
I just wanted. . . I was passing by
and. . . Thank you so much .

119
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:17,235
-He said ''much of it is very nice'' .
-Did he say ''much of it''?

120
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,750
-Those very words?
-Yes! ''Much of it is very nice.''

121
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:27,069
Did you hear that, Olga?
''Much of it is very nice'', he said .

122
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,110
Hello!

123
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,993
Have you listened to the cassette?

124
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,715
It's me, Lena . . .
The Bingo lottery ticket.

125
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:25,311
Carry on .
I'll be right there. Over there.

126
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:29,308
But your ticket didn't win.
I've checked . This is my boyfriend .

127
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,795
-Hi.
-Hello.

128
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,673
You've got to listen to it.

129
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:39,317
Bye. See you .
You need warmer clothes, Daniel.

130
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,274
No you fucking don't.

131
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,789
I told you!
You're not going anywhere!

132
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,993
Fucking slut!

133
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,030
Stop it, stop it!
For God's sake, stop it!

134
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:28,791
Well, if it isn't the little artist.
Get your hands off her!

135
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,152
Your kind don't belong here!

136
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:37,512
-I'm warning you!
-No, Conny!

137
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:40,678
Let go!
Mind your own business!

138
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:22,998
Conny. It's him.

139
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:35,512
I confess, oh righteous God-

140
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:39,395
-that I have sinned
in thought, word and deed .

141
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:45,436
I have not loved Thee above all else
nor my neighbour as myself.

142
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:49,599
Through my sins I am guilty
of more than I understand-

143
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:54,271
-and contribute to the world's
negligence of Thee.

144
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:59,349
I beseech Thee,
help me cease my sins.

145
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:04,236
Forgive me, in the name
of Jesus Christ. Amen .

146
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:28,914
This is a surprise.
A simple position as cantor.

147
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,953
Mass, weddings,
christenings, funerals. Is it worth it?

148
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,116
Music is all I know.

149
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:37,790
But the church is cold
and the salary meagre.

150
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,356
The pay is dreadful.
Take my advice, don't do it.

151
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:46,111
-My mind's made up.
-A new cantor. How nice. Welcome!

152
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:52,031
This is my wife, Inger. It's up to the
church council, so it'll take a while.

153
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:56,028
I'd like to begin immediately.

154
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:00,199
Do you realize the job
entails running the choir?

155
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:04,791
But they can't possibly
meet your demands.

156
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:13,238
Everything begins with listening .

157
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,318
-When do you finish?
-I'll call you later.

158
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:39,510
Imagine that all music already exists.

159
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:43,872
It's up here, all around, vibrating,
ready to be taken down .

160
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:50,428
It's all a matter of listening,
of being ready to take it down.

161
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,990
You understand?

162
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,395
-Get it, Fatso?
-Yes.

163
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:05,879
Each person has their own unique
tone, their own individual tone.

164
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,036
And we're going to find it.

165
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:22,998
Arne here. Yes. Yes. . .yes.

166
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:27,034
Don't you want that with a
built-in DVD, yeah . . .

167
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:30,789
It's got PAL, NTSC and . . .

168
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:35,871
No, no! just human voices.

169
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:40,278
Yes. Some advice, please,
on what to do.

170
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,548
How should I begin?

171
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:48,353
Right. . .

172
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,710
Balance.

173
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:56,238
Yes. Balance. . .

174
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:01,272
Yes, exactly. The torso.

175
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,470
And the stomach . Right.

176
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:12,591
We know where our stomachs are.
Let's massage them to wake them up.

177
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:15,553
And pat them . . .

178
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,910
. . .and massage them. Good!

179
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:26,194
Put your hands here. . .

180
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:32,589
And twist, backwards, then forwards.

181
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,075
Push away. . .

182
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:39,831
. . .making a large circle. Good.

183
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:43,112
Your fingers. . .

184
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:47,559
Then shake them out.

185
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,637
Excellent!

186
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:07,877
Listen, and give it back.

187
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:14,519
Let's hope no one walks in on us.
Is the door locked?

188
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:20,675
Each person has his
own individual tone.

189
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,395
Try and find yours.

190
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:30,675
Begin, slowly. . .to sound. . .

191
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:38,233
Find the harmony.

192
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:42,558
I started to think of the Pastor.

193
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,074
Music is about listening.

194
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:57,956
You're so eager, Arne!
The singing will come, later.

195
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:05,157
He's worked with the great vocalists.
And we have fun, too.

196
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:12,356
I haven't felt so happy
in a very long time!

197
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:16,155
Of course you must come,
you must.

198
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:20,831
See you on Thursday as usual. Bye.

199
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:26,034
-Don't you sing?
-No, not yet. Later, says Daniel.

200
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:31,268
-Why must you defend him?
-I'm not defending him .

201
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:35,632
I enjoy doing something new.
It's good he takes things gently.

202
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:41,915
-Don't deny you were defending him.
-He's trying to get to know us.

203
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,632
All hold hands.

204
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:14,758
Now we'll find the source. The core.

205
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:25,432
Let me be clear. Either you
participate, or you leave, please.

206
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:31,875
-I'm just here to listen.
-If you sit here it affects me.

207
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:35,470
I'm doing something here
that's entirely new to me.

208
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:41,789
-And what, may I ask, are you doing?
-New faces, new sounds. . .

209
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,673
Okay, Maestro.

210
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:52,315
There's a great difference between
people here and in the big wide world .

211
00:32:55,040 --> 00:33:00,876
One must observe certain limits.
As cantor many eyes are upon you.

212
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:09,437
-What a grump!
-I'm glad it's just us now.

213
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:14,395
Where were we? Arms out.
We are going to the source. . .

214
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,909
Excuse me.

215
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,430
Hello? Yes. Hi there!

216
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:24,394
No, I don't do renovations.

217
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:28,957
Is it a Cadillac? I know a guy.

218
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:34,154
He's really good. He sold one for
700,000 to a Norwegian last week.

219
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:39,559
I'll call you in an hour or so.
Okay? Bye.

220
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:45,393
Yep. . .we were going to the source,
right?

221
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:50,515
-Coffee break. Come along.
-Coffee? Now?

222
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,757
Haven't you understood a single
thing?

223
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:59,318
This is about us!
About who we are! About our lives!

224
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:04,116
All music comes from within!
Concentration!

225
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:09,717
Without concentration,
nothing can emerge! Nothing!

226
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:23,911
Here. Have some water.

227
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:33,797
Daniel, you know. . . this is all
so new to us. We aren't used to. . .

228
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,710
Coffee's important, too.

229
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:22,879
I knew it. Hell, I knew it.
Here we go!

230
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,551
Gabriella . . .

231
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,717
Lena . Olga .

232
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,070
Amanda .

233
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:11,274
Arne.

234
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:29,034
-In on one, see?
-Now find your unique voice. . .

235
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:37,039
. . .vibrating inside you .
Find your tone.

236
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:48,874
I'll take care of this.
Tore. . . Hello, Tore.

237
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:51,150
Arne, take it easy. It's only Tore.

238
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:54,875
-Give him a cookie.
-Tore, we're not locking up yet.

239
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:59,073
-Sit over here, Tore. Tore, here!
-Cookie?

240
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:03,432
I wan . . .join in.

241
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:08,111
-Tore, be a good boy now.
-Here's a bun, with sugar on top.

242
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:13,075
-He says he wants to join .
-Well, you see, he can't read or write.

243
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:18,115
-He's cuckoo.
-I want to join!

244
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:24,395
It'll just cause problems. I know.
We must have some criterion .

245
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:31,709
I think Tore should join us.
Isn't he your cousin, Arne?

246
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:41,278
For Christ's sake! I've got plans
for this choir! Don't you see?

247
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:44,313
I'm working very hard for us!

248
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:48,559
At the spring concert,
is Tore to be up there-

249
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:51,797
-next to fatso Holmfrid?

250
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:57,348
-Smoking outside, Arne.
-Oh for God's sake!

251
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:01,314
We can't just let everything slide!
All this newfangled. . .

252
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:04,114
Arne, wait!

253
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,395
Arne is so dedicated.

254
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:23,509
Great!

255
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:28,271
An A. Erik.

256
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,679
Gabriella .

257
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:39,112
Now we've got two basses!

258
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:49,878
It pisses me off! ''Isn't he your
cousin'' and ''smoking outside'' .

259
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,116
Calm down Arne.

260
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:57,269
Are we running some kind
of kindergarten?

261
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,830
Hiya . Hang on!

262
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:10,157
Could I come
an hour earlier next time?

263
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:14,432
I'd like you to help me.

264
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:18,674
So I can find my tone.

265
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,075
-Just you and I?
-Yes.

266
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:27,037
I've got to run. It's my new boyfriend.
See you! An hour earlier.

267
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,311
Bye-bye!

268
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:51,358
Stig, I've been wondering about
your voice.

269
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:55,519
Why do you sound so ceremonious
doing weddings?

270
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:58,792
'Will you take this. . .?'

271
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:04,757
-Marriage involves a major decision.
-But it can make people nervous.

272
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:09,272
''Will you take. . .'' People might
get second thoughts, Stig .

273
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:12,199
You do use different voices in church.

274
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:16,552
At christenings it's one voice.
At funerals, a different one.

275
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:22,630
-'Dust to dust; ashes to ashes.'
-Are you making fun of me?

276
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:27,550
-Stig, will you take this woman?
-That'll do now.

277
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:30,228
I'm being serious, Stig.

278
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:35,152
Will you take this woman?

279
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,234
Can I see your shoes?

280
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:49,194
You'll have to change shoes, or get
them reheeled, for the right balance.

281
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:55,109
Straighten your back.
Walk up and down a bit, and sing .

282
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:09,438
Take off your sweater.
We'll find your balance.

283
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:13,713
I know it's there.
It just needs to be set free.

284
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:20,112
Open your throat, open your chest.

285
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,275
Release your sound.

286
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:37,352
I want to. . .

287
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:42,395
-Is there something stopping you?
-It scares me.

288
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:47,751
It's all so much, I'm not sure I dare.

289
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:53,069
I'd like to tell you about something .

290
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:56,989
Once, during a concert
there was a power failure.

291
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:00,237
Everything went black.
But the musicians continued to play.

292
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:05,434
They couldn't see their music, nor me.
I leave it all up to the orchestra .

293
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:10,395
They all listen to each other.
No one sees me.

294
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:18,280
That's when I experienced it
for the first time. 58 seconds.

295
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:21,711
All minds were joined.

296
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:29,232
58 seconds. . .
That's a pretty long time.

297
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:35,430
Prague '82. I was 1 9.

298
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:41,476
-So you mean that. . .?
-It's all there.

299
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:45,912
This is the great secret.

300
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:51,877
When everyone knows that. . . That's
when we can take down the music.

301
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:06,068
I ask myself, what is he after?

302
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:14,676
Something's happening to people
there.

303
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:18,839
We haven't rehearsed anything,
not once.

304
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:25,275
-Not even for the services?
-Nothing at all .

305
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:30,395
He's up to something .
I'm sure of it.

306
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:33,717
What do you mean, Siv?

307
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:38,994
It feels like he's using us
for his own purposes.

308
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:45,870
I'd like you to keep attending, please.

309
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:53,513
Hurrah! Listen everybody, listen!

310
00:43:53,720 --> 00:44:00,831
Daniel has said yes!
He can judge if we're ready.

311
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:05,352
'Are we really going to charge?'
someone asked. Of course we are!

312
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:09,235
The village hall costs,
all venues cost.

313
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:16,312
So a concert should cost.
I thought: tickets, 100 crowns each.

314
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:19,830
It increases the product value.

315
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:22,315
Six weeks to go, to the concert.

316
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:27,469
The only valid excuse for absence
is your own funeral .

317
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:30,990
Great, Arne!

318
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:37,593
I'm finished . Now let's rehearse.

319
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:42,669
'Glorious is all on earth .'
Harmony.

320
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:49,115
Glorious is all on earth

321
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:56,754
There you are!
You came here even though . . .

322
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:01,828
I told you to stay at home!
Don't think I don't know!

323
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:04,952
Wait, wait. . .

324
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:09,472
Careful now, for Christ's sake!

325
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:17,997
-He's drunk. That's why he comes.
-He's dragged her away a few times.

326
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:23,274
But he beats her!
And everyone knows it.

327
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:35,309
I've tried talking to her so many
times. It's like talking to a wall.

328
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:41,030
-Why doesn't she leave him?
-He could do anything to her.

329
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:44,471
She doesn't dare, she's terrified.

330
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:52,470
Look at Tore there.
Now we're in the shit. God, it stinks!

331
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:57,151
-What did I tell you!
-Shut up, Arne.

332
00:45:57,360 --> 00:46:03,708
-Arne does have a point, Lena .
-God damn it Siv! Are you starting?!

333
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:08,072
Haven't you ever shit your pants?
I'm beginning to wonder!

334
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:11,078
Come along, Tore.

335
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:40,398
Say my name, Lena .

336
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:45,515
-Tore.
-Say the other thing, too.

337
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:50,635
-What is it you want me to say?
-The three words.

338
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:56,073
-The three words?
-Yes, say the three words.

339
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:58,874
I love you, Tore.

340
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:32,350
-Hello!
-Hello.

341
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:35,279
What are you doing?

342
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:39,473
Nothing special .

343
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:42,194
Going for a bike ride?

344
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,960
Yup. . .

345
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:49,472
Shall we ride together?

346
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:55,396
Lena, I don't know how.

347
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:04,359
You can't learn to ride a bike on your
own. Someone's got to hold on .

348
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:10,556
Don't pedal yet, I'll push .
Just try and keep your balance.

349
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:17,280
-This is interesting.
-Interesting?

350
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:22,554
Yes. You're the one
always talking about balance.

351
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:27,754
-Right. Climb on .
-Now, hold on .

352
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:39,669
-Are you holding on?
-Yes.

353
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:49,479
-You're holding on? You've got to.
-Yes! I am holding on. I am!

354
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:55,039
Eyes ahead . . . Don't look back!

355
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:06,799
You weren't holding on!

356
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,468
You weren't holding on .

357
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:15,759
Six metres, Daniel.
Not bad for first time.

358
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:44,797
There's no harmony. Sit down .

359
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:54,118
Is there anyone here who needs to
get something off their chest?

360
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:59,389
-I've something I'd like to bring up.
-Oh for God's sake.

361
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:04,037
-But we're going to have a party.
-Go on, Siv.

362
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:14,990
I've always thought that Lena has
a way, that's not good for this choir.

363
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:18,510
-And it concerns all of us.
-Lena?!

364
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:25,956
-''A way that's not good for the choir?''
-Arne, Daniel's asked us to be open.

365
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:29,835
So I really want to be honest.

366
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:32,759
Don't we have a responsibility
to each other here in the choir?

367
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:37,033
Lena and I sing the same part,
and we're to harmonize, aren't we?

368
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:43,475
Are we to just stand by and ignore
the kind of life she leads?

369
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:46,797
Why doesn't anyone ever object?

370
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:50,037
-Damn it! Pull yourself together, Siv!
-Arne. . .

371
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:54,438
It's not the Christian faith
to party on Saturday night. . .

372
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:57,200
. . .and then. . .

373
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:05,795
You know what I mean. . .

374
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:10,869
Then to stand in church
and sing on Sunday morning.

375
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:16,438
Inger, is this any type of example for
the young girls in the congregation?

376
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:22,590
Seeing Lena hop in and out of
all these different cars.

377
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:27,191
In and out of different cars?

378
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:31,109
It happens right in front of our eyes.
You know as well as I do.

379
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:34,312
The young girls might think
it has something to do with love.

380
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:37,398
That that's the way for a woman
to behave.

381
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:43,750
-There, I've said what I have to say.
-Right.

382
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:49,239
Admit it, Siv
you're just jealous of Lena .

383
00:52:57,600 --> 00:53:00,717
You ought to be ashamed, laughing
at someone who dares be honest!

384
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:04,276
Try being honest yourself!

385
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:13,597
Tore's pacing.
Where's the corkscrew?

386
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:16,712
I'll go out and get Siv. Party time!

387
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:22,233
FLORENCE, FLORENCE, FLORENCE!

388
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:33,354
Lips are silent

389
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:35,630
Eyes are speaking

390
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:40,118
Love me, do

391
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:45,155
Violins and bows play waltzes

392
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:48,079
Love me, do

393
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:54,118
This one's for you, Arne!

394
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:38,595
Sin in the congregation hall, Stig .
Go-go girls - like Sodom and Gomorrah .

395
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:46,709
-I know it all!
-You know it all?

396
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:48,876
-Yes!
-Nothing's happened.

397
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:51,958
You expose your breasts in the
congregation hall and this is nothing?

398
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:54,037
I was a bit tipsy, dancing . . .

399
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:56,629
-Sin has descended . . .
-Stop it!

400
00:55:56,840 --> 00:56:02,358
Inger, you have sinned!
On church premises!

401
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,276
Now I'm going to say something
I've wanted to say for a long time.

402
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:14,190
Something that's plagued me
for 20 years. There is no sin.

403
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:18,837
All this damn talk about sin!
It only exists in your head.

404
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:21,952
-What!
-There is no sin .

405
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:25,232
''There is no sin?''
Think of what you're saying!

406
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:29,956
I have thought.
The church invented sin .

407
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:35,314
Handing out guilt with one hand then
offering redemption with the other.

408
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:39,115
It's all a lie, hot air,
to suppress people, to gain power.

409
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:43,029
Silence! Ask for God's forgiveness!

410
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:46,073
God doesn't forgive,
don't you get that!

411
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:48,510
Because he's never condemned.

412
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:50,711
-Silence!
-Try to be humble, Stig.

413
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:53,798
I am humble!

414
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:16,433
You think I didn't know about it?

415
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:21,958
For years I've known you've had
your pictures here.

416
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:25,994
You've come out here
before we've made love. . .

417
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:31,877
To have a look. . .
Black stockings, high boots, bottoms. . .

418
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:37,438
To get stimulated . It's all right,
Stig . But don't condemn others.

419
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:41,349
Inger, God hears you.

420
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:43,710
He hears and he smiles,
you can bet on it.

421
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:49,438
The church has made a sin
of sexuality. God hasn't.

422
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:55,556
You've had a need,
you haven't hurt anyone by it.

423
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:59,878
There have been a few times in bed
we've enjoyed. . .

424
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:05,715
Even if we've never reached
Heaven together, not yet.

425
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:08,434
Stop it. . .

426
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:11,556
Stig .

427
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:22,349
I love you .

428
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:27,830
I always have.

429
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:31,237
I've kept everything inside.

430
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:38,714
But not any more.

431
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:45,473
I've kept my mouth shut,
repressed everything I've felt. . .

432
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:50,674
. . .and seen, and heard and thought.

433
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:58,352
Come. . .

434
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:05,991
Come, Stig. . .

435
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:14,394
Jesus Christ, forgive me my sins. . .

436
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:29,630
Inger, what happened last night
between us. . .

437
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:35,198
-I've longed for, for so long .
-Inger. . . It never happened .

438
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:41,793
-What?
-It never happened . . .

439
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:47,279
I repeat: what happened between us
last night never happened .

440
00:59:51,120 --> 01:00:00,358
The kindly green leaves of spring
have adorned the meadows and valleys

441
01:00:06,120 --> 01:00:10,113
We've got three new members in
the choir today, young people.

442
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:12,197
How nice.

443
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:22,833
The sunlight and whispering leaves

444
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:29,479
Proclaim the arrival of summer

445
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:34,037
Good! Very good!
That's how it should sound!

446
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:37,277
-Right?
-Yes!

447
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:42,634
One more thing, some good news:
ticket sales are going well.

448
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:47,675
We're getting a bit famous, see?
We should be sold out.!

449
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:50,758
Hurrah!
