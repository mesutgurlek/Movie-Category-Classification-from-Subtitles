18
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:42,258
Hi. I texted you.

19
00:01:42,335 --> 00:01:43,893
Yeah, I saw that. I was busy.

20
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:46,302
Well, Cristina would've responded.
That's not how it works.

21
00:01:46,372 --> 00:01:47,839
Not if she was doing what I was doing.

22
00:01:47,907 --> 00:01:49,602
You pause. That's the rule.

23
00:01:49,676 --> 00:01:51,303
- What?
- If the text is urgent,

24
00:01:51,377 --> 00:01:53,038
Cristina would say to Owen, "Pause,"

25
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:55,581
and I would say to Derek, "Pause,"
then we'd text each other back.

26
00:01:55,648 --> 00:01:58,139
- In the middle of sex?
- If the text is urgent.

27
00:01:58,218 --> 00:02:00,914
The fact you are checking your text
while you're doing it is already sad.

28
00:02:00,987 --> 00:02:03,615
We have a special ringtone.
Hey, you want a special ringtone?

29
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:06,716
No. Wait, this pause thing...

30
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:09,125
(CHUCKLES) Like, your legs are
in the air and you're screaming and...

31
00:02:09,195 --> 00:02:12,460
- Pause.
- No, I don't pause. Jo doesn't pause.

32
00:02:12,532 --> 00:02:14,693
She fast-forwards, she rewinds,

33
00:02:14,767 --> 00:02:16,632
- but she doesn't pause.
- Okay, that's gross.

34
00:02:16,703 --> 00:02:18,898
Do you wanna scrub in
on my IVC sarcoma?

35
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:20,337
- (EXHALES DEEPLY) Is it a kid?
- No.

36
00:02:20,406 --> 00:02:21,395
Then no. Why?

37
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:23,305
Because I want some company.

38
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:24,365
Get a resident.

39
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:26,378
I have a resident. I want a grownup.

40
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:27,538
Bye.

41
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:29,206
Cristina would've scrubbed in.
You're no good at this...

Bailey!

43

You wanna scrub in
on my IVC sarcoma?

44
00:02:32,685 --> 00:02:34,915
Well, you don't need me for that.
Don't you have a resident?

45
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,979
Residents are boring.
All they wanna do is learn.

46
00:02:37,056 --> 00:02:38,250
Come on. It's gonna be good.

47
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:41,555
It's all over the liver, hepatic vein.
It's gonna be bloody and gross.

48
00:02:42,195 --> 00:02:43,924
Does look like fun.

49
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:46,192

See you in the OR.

Adrian Nelson, 51.
Presents with abdominal pain.

51
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:54,005
Scans show a leiomyosarcoma
behind the liver, including the IVC.

52
00:02:54,073 --> 00:02:55,597
What's the surgical plan?

53
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:57,734
Laparotomy to isolate the vessel,

54
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:00,370
resect the tumor,
and then replace with a graft.

55
00:03:00,446 --> 00:03:02,346
It's a pretty straightforward
procedure, Adrian.

56
00:03:02,415 --> 00:03:03,973
I don't foresee any problems.

57
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:05,608
Could I ask you to...

58
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:07,448
It's silly. Never mind.

59
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,352
MEREDITH: What is it?

60
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,553
She wants you to swear on the book.

61
00:03:13,993 --> 00:03:15,426
The <i>Odyssey.</i>

62
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:18,487
- It's the first book I ever sold to Adrian.
- The day we met.

63
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:20,556
Michael's a rare book vendor.

64
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:22,362
Our hands touched
when I was ringing her up,

65
00:03:22,435 --> 00:03:24,403
and it was such a high. (CHUCKLES)

66
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:25,494
It was electric.

67
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:28,101
We were both too shy to ask for a date.

68
00:03:28,174 --> 00:03:29,903
So I wrote my number on a bookmark.

69
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:32,911
I saw it as soon as I got home,
and then I called.

70
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:34,913
We've been together ever since.

71
00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:39,049
This book, it's our wedding ring.

72
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:43,150
Could you swear on the book, Dr. Grey,
that you'll do your best?

73
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,315
It would mean so much.

74
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,657
Dr. Wilson, too.

75
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:48,785
- Sure.
- I swear.

76
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:56,600
MEREDITH: So Dr. Wilson will
prep you, and I'll see you up there.

77
00:03:57,537 --> 00:03:59,300
They're adorable.

78
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:00,805
They're weirdos.

79
00:04:01,474 --> 00:04:03,339
Okay, you're gonna feel
a little bit of pressure.

80
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:05,343
And this will tell us conclusively

81
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:08,073
if the osteogenesis imperfecta
is type II or III?

82
00:04:08,147 --> 00:04:09,978
- Yes.
- It's probably type III though, right?

83
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:12,677
I mean, so far there's been
no indication of fetal distress.

84
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:13,912
We'll know soon enough.

85
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,952
It'll be okay. OI type III, it's hard, sure.

86
00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:21,425
I mean, there's surgeries
and challenges, but we're surgeons.

87
00:04:21,494 --> 00:04:24,088
We can handle challenges, right?

88
00:04:24,163 --> 00:04:25,596
- Mmm-hmm.
- I mean, we'll...

89
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:29,396
We'll still be able to give
our baby a wonderful life. Right?

90
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:32,666
Many type III babies
live very, very happy lives.

91
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:39,437
Shouldn't Dr. Herman be doing this?

92
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:41,541
It's a very routine procedure.

93
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:43,980
Dr. Herman is the big gun.

94
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,416
We only fire the big gun
when we need the big gun.

95
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:49,649
I'm the little gun.
So let the little gun work.

96
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,233
Thank you so much.
I know that took up a lot of your time.

97
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,066
I just wanna get all of the views

98
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:07,163
with the thinnest cross sections
I can get.

99
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,434
And I find that adorable.

100
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:11,775
You really think you can
pull off your plan, huh?

101
00:05:11,844 --> 00:05:14,176
I've got all your past medical records.

102
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:15,714
Once I get a firm grasp

103
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:18,410
on the roads your other surgeons
took to get to "no,"

104
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:20,281
I can cut away a clear path to "yes."

105
00:05:20,586 --> 00:05:22,850
By the time I'm done with your tumor,
I'm gonna be able to tell you

106
00:05:22,922 --> 00:05:26,153
what street this bastard grew up on
and where it lost its virginity.

107
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:28,249
Hmm! Well, you certainly are confident.

108
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,057
- Thank you.
- Or delusional.

109
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:32,089
One of the two.

110
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:35,695
It's hard to tell. They look so similar.

111
00:05:40,406 --> 00:05:43,534
So I think we need to talk
about what we'll decide

112
00:05:43,609 --> 00:05:44,940
if it turns out the baby's type II.

113
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,478
I already told you, he won't be.

114
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:49,174
Yeah, I know that's what you believe.
So do I, obviously.

115
00:05:49,248 --> 00:05:52,411
But if he is type II, then it's so terrible...

116
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:54,919
- I know. (SIGHS)
...and fatal usually.

117
00:05:54,987 --> 00:05:56,477
All right? And before that,
it's even worse.

118
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:59,525
I know all of this. I just...
I don't wanna talk about it.

119
00:05:59,592 --> 00:06:01,492
But we should talk about it.
We need to talk about it.

120
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:03,722
Why? Why can't we just wait
until tomorrow?

121
00:06:03,796 --> 00:06:06,697
Because we should have a plan.
What do you mean?

122
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:08,893
Okay, what do you wanna do?

123
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:11,459
That's what I'm saying.
I think we should decide.

124
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:14,097
No, no. I'm asking what you want.

125
00:06:14,173 --> 00:06:16,266
I want for us to figure this out together.

126
00:06:16,342 --> 00:06:17,673
I don't think that's true.

127
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:19,769
I think that you already know
what you would wanna do.

128
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:20,972
- So...
- What?

129
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:23,481
Just... Yeah, just say it out loud.

130
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:25,949
- Don't...
- Right now. What do you wanna do?

131
00:06:26,018 --> 00:06:27,349
(SIGHS DEEPLY)

132
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:34,583
If our baby is type II, I...

133
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:38,487
I think we should terminate.

134
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:45,237
And I don't care whether
our baby is type II or type III.

135
00:06:45,304 --> 00:06:47,363
(VOICE BREAKING)
Either way, I wanna keep him.

136
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,532
April!

137
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:50,838
I told you I didn't wanna talk about this.

138
00:06:55,681 --> 00:06:57,239
JO: Look at all these adhesions.

139
00:06:57,316 --> 00:06:59,216
MIRANDA: Yeah, there's no way
to see 'em coming.

140
00:06:59,285 --> 00:07:01,719
Sneaky little bastards
won't show up on the scan.

141
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:04,018
MEREDITH: And there's more
of them posteriorly, too.

142
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,455
I need some more exposure.

143
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:07,015
JO: You're thinking of extending
the incision?

144
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,323
MEREDITH: I have to.
I can't see what's up in there.

145
00:07:09,395 --> 00:07:12,796
This tumor just keeps coming.
And all the landmarks are obscured.

146
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:15,095
I'm lost in here. It's like going in blind.

147
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:17,261
Hey! Would you bring
those scans closer, please?

148
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:18,667
MAN: Yes, Doctor.

149
00:07:20,306 --> 00:07:22,900
See, the tumor should be
in the suprahepatic IVC only.

150
00:07:22,975 --> 00:07:23,999
MEREDITH: That can't be right.

151
00:07:24,076 --> 00:07:25,805
It doesn't show
any further local invasion.

152
00:07:25,878 --> 00:07:27,311
Show me the coronal view?

153
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:30,440
MIRANDA: What's the tumor doing
all the way over there?

154
00:07:30,516 --> 00:07:32,074
MEREDITH: That's what I want to know.

155
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:34,346
- How old are these scans?
- JO: They're only two weeks old.

156
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:35,887
MEREDITH: And they're
completely outdated.

157
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,946
I mean, this thing is growing too fast.

158
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:39,423
Nothing is where it's supposed to be.

159
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:41,892
MIRANDA: Tumor has extended to
the IVC tributaries.

160
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:44,293
- Yeah, these scans are useless.
- MEREDITH: I can't see what I'm doing.

161
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:47,355
Oh, God. It's also spreading
through the diaphragm. Suction.

162
00:07:47,433 --> 00:07:48,866
- I can't even see where...
- (SUCTION GURGLING)

163
00:07:48,935 --> 00:07:50,197
JO: Neither can I.

164
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:52,601
MEREDITH: Don't touch that.
It's tearing.

165
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:54,867
MIRANDA: The tumor's extended all
the way up between the lungs.

166
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:57,432
- Someone page cardio!
- It's all the way up into the pericardium.

167
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:59,637
MEREDITH: Get the suction out.
Don't touch it. Don't do anything.

168
00:07:59,712 --> 00:08:00,974
MIRANDA: Okay, page cardio, 911!

169
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:03,242
MEREDITH: We gotta get out.
Everybody out. Hands off.

170
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,412
(MONITOR BEEPING STEADILY)

171
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:12,054
JO: What are we doing?
What's going on?

172
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:19,591
Can someone say something?
What are we doing?

173
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:21,792
MIRANDA: It's spread from her
major blood vessels to her liver,

174
00:08:21,868 --> 00:08:24,132
diaphragm, pericardium,
and maybe even her heart.

175
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:26,433
How can one tumor
grow this big this fast?

176
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,371
- MIRANDA: It is everywhere.
- It's a monster.

177
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:29,772
So what do we do?

178
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:34,571
I have no idea.

179
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:53,329
MEREDITH: Michael, I'm afraid
Adrian's tumor has grown considerably

180
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:55,333
and it's now reaching around her heart.

181
00:08:55,401 --> 00:08:57,096
So Dr. Pierce is here.

182
00:08:57,169 --> 00:08:58,932
Her heart?

183
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:01,235
It's entangled through the vein
that stretches up

184
00:09:01,307 --> 00:09:02,934
from her liver to her heart.

185
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:05,500
And it's growing
more rapidly than anticipated.

186
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:07,705
So we need to take her for more MRIs

187
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:11,147
so we can see how extensive
the tumor's growth is.

188
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:13,076
Now there's all of you.

189
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:15,946
Three doctors. (INHALES DEEPLY)

190
00:09:16,522 --> 00:09:17,784
Three is a lot.

191
00:09:21,193 --> 00:09:25,152
Look, Odysseus didn't return
to Ithaca all by himself.

192
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:28,394
He needed a lot of help, right,
from the Phaeacians?

193
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:30,401
Well, we're the Phaeacians.

194
00:09:30,469 --> 00:09:33,233
You want all the Phaeacians
you can get.

195
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:35,638
We are going to figure this tumor out.

196
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:40,501
Oh!

197
00:09:41,847 --> 00:09:43,576
- Mmm! So light.
- And it's last year's model.

198
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:46,641
We're weeks away from unveiling one
that will weigh 30% less.

199
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:48,619
Wow. Very impressive.

200
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:50,519
Your project is impressive.

201
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,582
Robotic limbs for injured vets?
Sexy as hell.

202
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:57,652
And we at CyberSystems are dying
to climb into bed with you.

203
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:59,459
Well, that's very flattering.

204
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:01,261
Good. I want it to be.

205
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:04,662
I'll leave you this folder
so you can go over the materials.

206
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:06,500
I'll be in Seattle another day,

207
00:10:06,572 --> 00:10:09,803
so, please, call me
if you need anything.

208
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:12,469
Thank you. Thank you for coming in.

209
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,039
So what do you think?

210
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:17,946
- I think you should definitely go for it.
- Really?

211
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:19,951
'Cause I was not that impressed
with these transducers.

212
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:22,317
What? No. No, those things are crap.

213
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:23,980
I'm talking about her.

214
00:10:24,056 --> 00:10:26,490
Her vibes? You didn't feel her vibes?

215
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:29,391
Major vibage for Major Hunt.

216
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:32,363
- (SCOFFS) You read that totally wrong.
- Oh, please.

217
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:34,331
"Your project's sexy as hell.

218
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:36,660
"Ooh! Ooh, let's climb into bed."

219
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:37,862
I was actually uncomfortable.

220
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:39,063
- Stop it!
- (GIGGLES)

221
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,674
There you are. Where have you been?

222
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:44,676
I was performing a CVS
on April Kepner.

223
00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:46,735
We're just waiting for the results.
God, I hate waiting.

224
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:48,177
In peds, it's so much easier.

225
00:10:48,247 --> 00:10:49,805
You know, the parents are right there.

226
00:10:49,882 --> 00:10:52,112
And you talk to them,
and then their kid is right there,

227
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:54,448
so they can hold them close
and hope for the best.

228
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,646
The cat's on the roof.

229
00:10:55,721 --> 00:10:57,188
With this, there's no kid to hold.

230
00:10:57,256 --> 00:10:59,622
The problem feels so theoretical.

231
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:01,091
You know, there's no cat,
there's no roof.

232
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,094
There's just two scared parents
feeling totally helpless.

233
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:04,424
And you've had the results rushed?

234
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,397
Yeah. I should get them in,
like, 24 hours.

235
00:11:06,465 --> 00:11:09,832
Then there's nothing more
to do about it today, which is good.

236
00:11:09,902 --> 00:11:11,665
I have been working miracles.

237
00:11:12,538 --> 00:11:16,565
I have found us
the most incredible surgeries,

238
00:11:16,642 --> 00:11:17,904
all for the next few weeks.

239
00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:20,605
Look, a TTTS in a 19-weeker,

240
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,672
a 21 -week TRAP sequence
that needs an RFA,

241
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:25,910
a unilateral pulmonary agenesis.

242
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:27,680
And that is just the beginning.

243
00:11:27,753 --> 00:11:30,483
- The beginning of what?
- Your crash course.

244
00:11:30,556 --> 00:11:33,491
I have hunted down
the most screwed up,

245
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:35,993
medically compromised fetuses
that I could find,

246
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:38,121
and I'm bringing them all here
to this hospital

247
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:40,495
for you to learn and us to save.

248
00:11:40,566 --> 00:11:42,864
- And you'll get to fix them all?
- We will.

249
00:11:43,335 --> 00:11:44,563
Start reading.

250
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,267
You can thank me later.

251
00:11:54,613 --> 00:11:56,945
And then, and this sounds crazy,
I know, so don't even...

252
00:11:57,016 --> 00:12:01,214
I'll build in a distribution
of a radioactive seed during surgery,

253
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:04,256
keeping Dr. Herman's tumor bed
free of recurring cells.

254
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:05,722
I thought you were gonna use a laser.

255
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:08,089
I am. I already did. We're way past that.

256
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,184
RICHARD: Try and keep up.

257
00:12:09,261 --> 00:12:12,025
I'm sorry, Shepherd,
but this is a great opportunity

258
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:13,565
- for them to learn.
- I know. It's fine.

259
00:12:13,632 --> 00:12:16,260
The laser is for ablating cells
off the optic nerve.

260
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:19,429
- It's a massive butterfly glioma.
- Well, it's not just massive.

261
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:21,973
I mean, it's magnificent.

262
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:24,737
No, no, no.
I mean that won't a laser take months?

263
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:27,335
Again, before that, I'll be using

264
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:30,143
the ultrasonic surgical aspirator
to mush and flush the cells,

265
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:32,548
then the sexy laser and the... Yeah.

266
00:12:32,618 --> 00:12:33,744
I'm sorry. I'm just lost.

267
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:35,013
You were just talking about
laser ablation.

268
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:36,554
So is that confined to the optic chiasm

269
00:12:36,622 --> 00:12:38,749
- or will that extend...
- Guys, step back.

270
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:42,892
Look at the whole big,
beautiful, shapely thing.

271
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:46,796
Every part of this tumor's body
will respond differently.

272
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:48,959
You will need a multitude
of approaches.

273
00:12:49,034 --> 00:12:52,299
You will have to be gentle with one part
and rough with the other.

274
00:12:52,371 --> 00:12:56,171
That is the only way she will respond.
Get it?

275
00:12:56,242 --> 00:12:57,641
I don't see tumors the way she does.

276
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:01,339
Didn't five surgeons say
any one of these approaches would

277
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:02,937
likely kill the patient?

278
00:13:03,015 --> 00:13:04,277
Six.

279
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:08,081
But none of them tried it all
at the same time. It should work.

280
00:13:08,154 --> 00:13:10,918
Maybe we should start over again
from the beginning.

281
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,014
Okay.

282
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:16,450
I will begin with a bifrontal approach.

283
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:18,929
MAGGIE: Is that the right atrium?
I can't tell.

284
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:21,023
Everything looks like mush.

285
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,727
Look at this angle right here.

286
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,235
Is that invading the right atrium?

287
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:25,463
I think that's a motion artifact.

288
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:27,438
- Crap.
- MIRANDA: Adrian's back in her room.

289
00:13:27,506 --> 00:13:29,667
Stable for now. How we doing here?

290
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:32,677
- Has the Cyclops revealed himself?
- The Cyclops?

291
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:34,440
Well, the patient's a fan
of The <i>Odyssey,</i>

292
00:13:34,513 --> 00:13:38,108
so I'm calling the tumor the Cyclops
'cause it's a big, ugly monster.

293
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:41,085
And I feel like I'm working with one eye
because I can see it,

294
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:43,644
but I can't get a sense
of the whole thing.

295
00:13:43,722 --> 00:13:44,984
Every view is incomplete.

296
00:13:45,057 --> 00:13:48,993
Okay, what if we get a new set
of scans, with contrast,

297
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:50,858
this time with 3-D reconstruction?

298
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:52,522
Well, the woman's lying open
in her bed.

299
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:54,225
We don't have time
for a lot of trial and error.

300
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,234
I just wanna reach in and grab it.

301
00:13:56,302 --> 00:13:59,533
Well, we could go in with these,
but, yeah, I can't see.

302
00:14:00,906 --> 00:14:04,535
If I could just hold it in my hand
so that I could see it...

303
00:14:05,444 --> 00:14:06,968
- Holy crap.
- What?

304
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:08,172
She's having an idea.

305
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:10,442
I already had it last year,
and it's brilliant.

306
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:14,418
We are going to print it.
The whole tumor.

307
00:14:14,486 --> 00:14:16,579
I tried it with the portal veins,
but it's not working.

308

we don't need it to function.

We just need to be able to see it,

- MIRANDA: Know your enemy.

00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:25,792
- Is this gonna work?
- It'll work.

MIRANDA: Oh, 2% left to upload.

313

This is how we beat this thing.

This is how we get visualization.

We are going to have
a tangible, anatomically correct

327
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:16,137
Okay. So then how can you...

328
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:18,479
Because we don't know
what will happen.

329
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:21,451
- We don't even know if he's type II.
- Okay, but what if he is?

- Yes.

Knowing that he's loved and wanted.

00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:33,428
Baby, his bones can break
if you touch him.

His bones can break
if we're changing his diaper.

We're doctors. We can handle it.

If anyone can handle it, we can.

337
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:41,433
I'm not saying we can't handle it.
I'm asking if we should.

Yeah, we're doctors.

00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:45,042
Maybe we are better equipped to
make an educated decision here.

00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:54,786
Yeah. People need their mom

Are you working today?

- No.
- Then let's get out of here.

350
00:16:10,569 --> 00:16:13,333
- You could use a change of scenery.
- That's actually a really good idea.

351
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:14,804
We should take the day,

I can't.

I can't go home alone
when she's like this.

363

Thought I'd just stay and read.

Okay. That's fine.

365

Can't concentrate.

367
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:07,717
It's odd. I've never had that problem.

368
00:17:08,927 --> 00:17:12,829
I think it's because
I don't know where she is.

I always know where she is.

Not really.

373
00:17:25,177 --> 00:17:26,940
Because she might not wake up.

374
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,015
I feel like...

375
00:17:30,082 --> 00:17:33,245
Like she's sailed away
and I don't know if she's coming back.

I would say that
there's something about him

00:21:28,887 --> 00:21:31,685
- You're here late.
- Well, we're on a timeline.

468
00:21:31,757 --> 00:21:34,157
I was taking a look at Dr. Wall's notes,

469
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:35,887
and I found
some contradictory information.

470
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:37,360
He was the second opinion?

471
00:21:38,363 --> 00:21:40,729
- Wall is where?
- Case Western.

472
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:43,058
Uh, he was third. He's radiation.

473
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:45,501
Right. Just getting my dates straight.

474
00:21:46,171 --> 00:21:48,935
- What are all these?
- Cases. Fetuses.

475
00:21:49,174 --> 00:21:52,473
Each card represents a fetus
that I'm gonna teach Robbins how to fix.

476
00:21:52,911 --> 00:21:56,972
That I estimate we can get to
in the time I have.

477
00:21:57,049 --> 00:21:59,142
- And those?
- These?

478
00:21:59,217 --> 00:22:02,448
No. These are the ones
that I could save,

479
00:22:02,521 --> 00:22:04,489
if I had time.

480
00:22:04,556 --> 00:22:07,457
You should just think of them
as babies who will die

481
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:10,586
if it turns out that you're full of crap
and can't take out my tumor.

482
00:22:11,797 --> 00:22:12,786
Oh.

483
00:22:13,198 --> 00:22:15,928
- No pressure.
- Oh, no. Pressure.

484
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:18,435
We're on a timeline here, right?

485
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:19,993
Try being me.

486
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,039
Okay.

487
00:22:29,314 --> 00:22:30,975
WOMAN: (ON P.A.)
<i>Dr. Meadows, labor and delivery.</i>

488
00:22:31,049 --> 00:22:33,313
<i>Dr. Meadows, labor and delivery.</i>

489
00:22:39,925 --> 00:22:40,949
(DOOR CLOSES)

490
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:42,823
Oh, good! You're home!

491
00:22:42,894 --> 00:22:44,327
Just in time for dinner.

492
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:46,527
Smells good.

493
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:48,627
How was church?

494
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,099
KAREN: The choir was there,

495
00:22:50,168 --> 00:22:52,466
practicing for their service
tomorrow night.

496
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:54,835
Really beautiful. We should all go to it.

497
00:22:54,906 --> 00:22:59,036
I don't think we'll know
what we'll be up for tomorrow, Karen.

498
00:22:59,678 --> 00:23:01,612
Because of the test results?

499
00:23:02,514 --> 00:23:05,677
April told me about the test,
and I told her

500
00:23:05,751 --> 00:23:08,549
there's really no point
in even getting those results.

501
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:11,612
- Excuse me?
- God gives what he wants to give.

502
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:13,885
No test is going to change that.

503
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:17,191
And April's already so upset,
so stressed.

504
00:23:17,262 --> 00:23:18,820
It's not good for the baby.

505
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:22,424
Just focus on loving
that sweet little baby.

506
00:23:22,501 --> 00:23:24,162
That's all that matters.

507
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:26,636
No, that's definitely not all that matters.

508
00:23:26,705 --> 00:23:29,538
I know, it's hard
to understand sometimes

509
00:23:29,608 --> 00:23:31,303
how His plan will unfold.

510
00:23:31,376 --> 00:23:33,401
Yeah, but I'm not worried
about His plan, am I?

511
00:23:33,478 --> 00:23:34,536
I'm worried about our plan.

512
00:23:34,613 --> 00:23:36,706
He never gives us
more than we can handle.

513
00:23:36,782 --> 00:23:38,147
Getting the results,

514
00:23:38,216 --> 00:23:39,843
being informed about
our baby's condition,

515
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:41,044
that's how we handle it.

516
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:42,814
I called our pastor at home.

517
00:23:42,888 --> 00:23:45,083
April spoke to him at length.
He was very helpful.

518
00:23:45,157 --> 00:23:46,556
JACKSON: April.

519
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:48,786
Me. Let me help you.

520
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,828
KAREN: (SIGHS) Whatever happens,
we will shoulder the burden

521
00:23:50,896 --> 00:23:52,056
when it is placed upon us.

522
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:54,223
We will. You and I.
We'll shoulder the burden.

523
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:55,789
She's just trying to help.

524
00:23:55,867 --> 00:23:58,335
Is she, though? Really? Is she helping?

525
00:23:58,403 --> 00:24:00,428
Don't snap at her.

526
00:24:00,505 --> 00:24:01,870
- Don't talk to her in that tone.
- What tone?

527
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,635
I'm not talking using a tone.
I'm trying to understand.

528
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:05,300
KAREN: You're trying to talk my little girl

529
00:24:05,377 --> 00:24:07,868
into doing something
she knows in her heart and soul

530
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:09,140
she does not want to do.

531
00:24:09,214 --> 00:24:10,511
JACKSON: I'm not trying to
talk her into anything.

532
00:24:10,582 --> 00:24:12,675
I'm supporting her in trying to
make the best choice possible

533
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:14,309
for our baby, for her, for our family.

534
00:24:14,386 --> 00:24:16,547
- This is between April and her God.
- (CHUCKLES) Okay.

535
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:19,146
And if you think she is going to agree

536
00:24:19,224 --> 00:24:21,124
- to abort her child...
- Our child!

537
00:24:21,193 --> 00:24:22,717
- You are...
- Get that straight. It's our child.

538
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:25,228
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

539
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:27,629
None of this is helping!

540
00:24:27,699 --> 00:24:29,690
You are not helping, neither of you.

541
00:24:29,768 --> 00:24:31,531
I am standing here,
listening to you tell me

542
00:24:31,603 --> 00:24:32,934
that God only gives me one choice,

543
00:24:33,004 --> 00:24:35,632
and you telling me that I should
forgo God's choice.

544
00:24:35,707 --> 00:24:37,971
And the truth is, I don't know anything

545
00:24:38,043 --> 00:24:42,275
expect that I am scared and sad
and I'm alone.

546
00:24:43,448 --> 00:24:45,973
You're both just standing there,
yelling at each other and talking at me,

547
00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:49,919
(VOICE BREAKING)
But I am alone, and it is terrifying!

548
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:52,684
And the louder you get,
the more terrified I become,

549
00:24:52,757 --> 00:24:56,090
so I just need you both to just shut up!

550
00:24:57,295 --> 00:24:59,820
Can you... Can you do that?

551
00:24:59,898 --> 00:25:03,994
Can you please, can you please
both just shut up?

552
00:25:04,069 --> 00:25:05,127
(APRIL CRYING)

(PRINTER WHIRRING)

554
00:25:22,087 --> 00:25:24,317
What are you guys still doing here?

555
00:25:24,389 --> 00:25:27,256
We're solving a tumor by 3-D printing it.

556
00:25:27,325 --> 00:25:28,656
Yeah.

557
00:25:28,727 --> 00:25:30,194
What are you still doing here?

558
00:25:30,262 --> 00:25:31,820
Also solving a tumor.

559
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:33,789
Maybe you should 3-D print your tumor.

560
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:36,633
AMELIA: (SIGHS)
Visibility is not my problem.

561
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:40,603
I can see my tumor
in all its problematic glory,

562
00:25:40,672 --> 00:25:41,969
and it's giving me the middle finger

563
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,270
in front of Richard Webber
and a bunch of residents.

564
00:25:44,943 --> 00:25:45,967
Where are the kids?

565
00:25:46,845 --> 00:25:48,005
Upstairs.

566
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:50,274
Daycare. Nightcare. Whatever care.

567
00:25:50,348 --> 00:25:51,906
It's open 24 hours.

568
00:25:51,983 --> 00:25:54,543
You know that's only
for surgeons on call, right?

569
00:25:54,619 --> 00:25:56,883
Bailey, don't judge me.
Derek lives in DC.

570
00:25:56,955 --> 00:26:00,857
No, I'm saying if they ask you,
make up something about being on call.

571
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:03,523
When I had my genome lab,
I was on call twice a week.

572
00:26:03,595 --> 00:26:07,326
You all realize that printing this thing
is gonna take, like, five more hours?

573
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:08,593
- Seven-ish.
- Seven hours and 20 minutes.

574
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:10,191
Seven and a half.

575
00:26:10,268 --> 00:26:13,999
I'm just saying you could go home,
sleep, and then come back.

576
00:26:14,606 --> 00:26:17,040
Someone has to stay
in case the printer crashes.

577
00:26:18,677 --> 00:26:22,078
Plus, I don't mind. I like the sound.
It's kinda soothing.

578
00:26:25,884 --> 00:26:28,284
It feels weird to sleep alone.

579
00:26:28,787 --> 00:26:31,278
I'm not used to it. I don't know why.

580
00:26:31,656 --> 00:26:33,817
He used to go away all the time,

581
00:26:34,793 --> 00:26:36,886
but this time, he's...

582
00:26:36,962 --> 00:26:40,022
He's gone, and I know he's gone.

583
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:42,524
And the bed feels lonely.

584
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:48,298
It's like I don't know how to sleep alone.

585
00:26:48,974 --> 00:26:50,601
You don't.

586
00:26:50,675 --> 00:26:53,906
I mean, before three months ago,
any time I called your house

587
00:26:53,979 --> 00:26:56,504
or came over or Skyped or whatever,

588
00:26:56,581 --> 00:26:57,878
Cristina was there.

589
00:26:57,949 --> 00:26:59,883
There's no way you ever slept alone.
I mean, you had Derek.

590
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:01,441
And if you didn't have Derek,
you had Cristina.

591
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:03,419
I'm guessing if it came down to it,

592
00:27:03,488 --> 00:27:05,388
you were, like, the middle spoon

593
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:09,018
in the middle of
a very weird spooning situation.

594
00:27:11,262 --> 00:27:14,595
I've never met a less alone person
than you used...

595
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:17,366
Used to be.

596
00:27:20,405 --> 00:27:23,169
I have to learn to sleep alone.

597
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:28,238
Ben snores.
And he sometimes talks in his sleep.

598
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:29,541
And he's hot.

599
00:27:29,614 --> 00:27:30,979
Like a furnace.

600
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:33,279
Like flames shootin' out of him.

601
00:27:33,351 --> 00:27:34,943
He's lucky I love him.

602
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:38,979
And he's a resident
and hardly home at night.

603
00:27:39,057 --> 00:27:40,354
Or he'd be dead.

604
00:27:43,128 --> 00:27:45,460
I miss sleeping with a man in my bed.

605
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:47,327
You know, facing away from each other,

606
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:50,960
barely touching expect for just
the arm thrown over your waist.

607
00:27:52,804 --> 00:27:57,503
When I'd wake up at night,
terrified of me,

608
00:27:59,077 --> 00:28:00,942
I liked knowing he was there

609
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,543
and I wasn't by myself.

610

(SIGHS)

611
00:28:10,555 --> 00:28:14,218
I cannot sleep with someone
lying next to me.

612
00:28:14,292 --> 00:28:15,554
Literally cannot.

613
00:28:16,428 --> 00:28:18,157
My one serious guy, Dean.

614
00:28:19,164 --> 00:28:21,428
Dean just loved to spoon and snuggle,

615
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:24,598
and I would just lie there,

616
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:27,331
staring up silently,

617
00:28:27,405 --> 00:28:29,703
counting the seconds
until he would fall asleep

618
00:28:29,774 --> 00:28:31,901
and I could sneak off
to sleep on the sofa.

619
00:28:31,976 --> 00:28:33,102
And then I'd sneak back into bed

620
00:28:33,178 --> 00:28:35,146
- before he woke up in the morning.
- (CHUCKLES)

621
00:28:35,413 --> 00:28:38,075
Yeah, people think that's a cute story.
It's not a cute story.

622
00:28:38,149 --> 00:28:40,310
That sofa was hard as a rock.
I was exhausted.

623

MAGGIE: Dean is a really sweet guy.

624
00:28:43,988 --> 00:28:46,786
He's tall and kind.

625
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:49,193
Civil rights lawyer.

626
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,693
He's funny.

627
00:28:51,796 --> 00:28:53,889
So when he proposed,

628
00:28:53,965 --> 00:28:56,525
I explained to him about the sleeping.

629
00:28:56,601 --> 00:28:57,761
I said,

630
00:28:57,836 --> 00:29:01,101
"Maybe you could sleep in a room
down the hall."

631
00:29:01,172 --> 00:29:02,969
I wanted to sleep alone.

632
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:05,535
And what happened?

633
00:29:06,277 --> 00:29:09,405
He is now married to someone
who loves to spoon and snuggle.

634
00:29:09,614 --> 00:29:11,275
(CHUCKLES)

635
00:29:11,349 --> 00:29:13,544
And I sleep like a baby every night.

636
00:29:16,221 --> 00:29:18,519
I might be too good at being alone.

637
00:29:27,899 --> 00:29:30,595
Maybe I could print a Derek.

638
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:34,666
Just for sleeping.

00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,707
Hey, move your butts.

00:30:17,882 --> 00:30:19,975
Hello again, Cyclops.

641
00:30:20,051 --> 00:30:22,144
JO: It is crazy cool amazing.

642
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:23,687
It could not be more amazing.

643
00:30:23,755 --> 00:30:25,154
Okay, hit me. What's next?

644
00:30:25,523 --> 00:30:27,957
I think we can divide the diaphragm

645
00:30:28,026 --> 00:30:31,359
to resect the pericardial component
of the tumor.

646
00:30:31,429 --> 00:30:32,691
MAGGIE: But carefully.

647
00:30:32,764 --> 00:30:34,959
We'll need to dissect
two to three centimeters

648
00:30:35,033 --> 00:30:38,332
proximal to the IVC first to control flow.

649
00:30:38,403 --> 00:30:39,870
Yep, and then we can clamp

650
00:30:39,938 --> 00:30:43,271
and create
the veno-venous bypass flap.

651
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:45,366
You sure you don't wanna do
a sternotomy?

652
00:30:45,443 --> 00:30:47,377
Now you have something to say?
Where were you yesterday?

653
00:30:47,445 --> 00:30:49,379
- You should've showed me this.
- Karev, what's your point?

654
00:30:49,447 --> 00:30:51,210
Well, I would do McGinn's technique

655
00:30:51,282 --> 00:30:53,341
to access the chest
with less invasiveness

656
00:30:53,418 --> 00:30:56,182
to avoid diaphragmatic hernia
postradiation.

657
00:30:57,555 --> 00:31:00,217
- He's got a point.
- Back to the beginning.

658
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:20,271
MEREDITH: Okay, so feel this,
right here.

659
00:31:20,345 --> 00:31:24,372
Okay, that's what, like five centimeters
superior to the renal vein?

660
00:31:24,449 --> 00:31:25,473
Okay, but stop.

661
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:28,849
- Close your eyes and just feel.
- Okay.

662
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:32,356
Because all we have to go on
is muscle memory.

663
00:31:33,191 --> 00:31:36,524
It's two fingerbreadths

664
00:31:36,594 --> 00:31:39,028
from the confluence
of the hepatic veins.

665
00:31:39,097 --> 00:31:42,294
And then we anastomose
the bifurcated graft.

666
00:31:42,367 --> 00:31:43,629
Bailey?

667
00:31:44,602 --> 00:31:45,728
Write that up.

668
00:31:56,347 --> 00:31:57,541
You're their board bitch.

669
00:31:57,615 --> 00:32:00,277
- You're jealous, aren't you?
- No. A little.

670
00:32:00,351 --> 00:32:02,342
- Wilson!
- Oh, yeah. On it.

671
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,690
Okay, my finger is in
the foramen of Winslow.

672
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:14,254
- Bailey, can you feel me?
- Yeah, I'm right behind you.

673
00:32:14,332 --> 00:32:17,233
I can feel the edge
of the lesser omentum.

674
00:32:17,302 --> 00:32:20,999
I think that gives me enough space
to control the porta hepatis.

675
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:24,272
Yes. Yes. I can palpate a good window.

676
00:32:24,342 --> 00:32:25,775
Good. That works.

- All right, what next?

00:32:30,014 --> 00:32:32,244
There is no next.
The wound VAC has frank blood.

680

We have to get her up to the OR.

- Yes. Wilson's.

Take that white board. Bring it
up where everyone can see it.

683

We haven't even gotten to
the retroperitoneal dissection yet.

We will when we get up there.
We'll figure it out as we go.

You are coming with me.

686
00:32:51,002 --> 00:32:53,800
MEREDITH: I'm into
the retrohepatic area. More suction.

687
00:32:53,871 --> 00:32:56,101

in either direction, so you're close.

MAGGIE: Damn it. Adhesions here, too.

693

MAGGIE: Same problem up here.
Can I get some more suction, please?

697
00:33:17,195 --> 00:33:19,857
MIRANDA: Should we control
the hepatic veins

698
00:33:19,931 --> 00:33:21,796
- and resect part of the liver?
- MEREDITH: I'm trying.

699
00:33:21,866 --> 00:33:23,094
I think that's the only way.

700
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:27,103
But without visibility,
I might hit a major vessel. Pierce?

gonna help them.

than the scans did.

- And they still can't see enough to...

and ditched me for another tumor.

717
00:34:12,817 --> 00:34:14,580
I thought you might need this.

718
00:34:15,953 --> 00:34:19,081
Are you keeping tabs on me?
Is that what's happening?

719
00:34:19,157 --> 00:34:21,216
No. Why would you say that?

720
00:34:21,292 --> 00:34:23,123
Because you might be worried
about me,

721
00:34:23,194 --> 00:34:26,823
and that I have decided
I can do something that cannot be done

722
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:31,631
just so that I can prove that I am okay
and that I deserve to be here.

723
00:34:31,702 --> 00:34:34,671
- That I'm overreaching.
- Should I be keeping tabs on you?

I mean, you saw the look on
those residents' faces yesterday.

They think that I am certifiable.

And why shouldn't they?

727
00:34:43,848 --> 00:34:45,748
Why should I think that I can do this?

728
00:34:45,817 --> 00:34:48,115
Why shouldn't I think
that I'm gonna kill this woman

729
00:34:48,186 --> 00:34:50,347
- and all those little babies with her?
- You are not doing that. No.

- Nobody thinks that this can work.
- No one understands it.

You were talking way over
those residents' heads.

732

And you think so fast,
it made my eyes spin.
