1
00:01:06,512 --> 00:01:07,980
Good evening, child.

2
00:01:10,583 --> 00:01:11,550
Evening, Mama.

3
00:01:11,784 --> 00:01:13,652
Home already? I'm so happy.

4
00:01:13,853 --> 00:01:14,854
Mama...

5
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,422
Not so fast.

6
00:01:16,522 --> 00:01:18,457
Please. Leave me be.
I'm tired.

7
00:01:18,591 --> 00:01:20,326
I can quite believe it.

8
00:01:20,493 --> 00:01:22,828
Your last pupil left 3 hours ago.

9
00:01:22,995 --> 00:01:25,731
Might I know
where you've been all this time?

10
00:01:25,865 --> 00:01:26,465
Please.

11
00:01:26,599 --> 00:01:29,635
No, you don't.
Not until you tell me!

12
00:01:30,302 --> 00:01:31,170
No.

13
00:01:33,839 --> 00:01:35,841
I went for a walk. Do you mind?

14
00:01:36,242 --> 00:01:40,079
I spent 8 hours in my cage.
I was tired and needed some air.

15
00:01:40,179 --> 00:01:42,214
- For three hours?
- Absolutely!

16
00:02:01,767 --> 00:02:03,469
Magnificent.

17
00:02:03,769 --> 00:02:05,271
Just as I thought.

18
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,182
Where's the bankbook?

19
00:02:21,587 --> 00:02:23,456
10,000 Schillings!

20
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:26,959
Tell me, have you lost your mind?

21
00:02:29,261 --> 00:02:30,663
Where's my grey Autumn suit?

22
00:02:31,931 --> 00:02:33,532
No idea.

23
00:02:35,201 --> 00:02:35,901
Give that back.

24
00:02:36,001 --> 00:02:36,469
No.

25
00:02:37,603 --> 00:02:38,070
No.

26
00:02:43,809 --> 00:02:44,777
Bitch!

27
00:02:45,945 --> 00:02:47,713
I remember that talk show.

28
00:02:47,847 --> 00:02:50,049
The guy advocated fines
for dog owners

29
00:02:50,182 --> 00:02:52,218
whose dogs crap in the street.

30
00:02:52,685 --> 00:02:53,452
Bullshit.

31
00:02:53,719 --> 00:02:57,990
The creep was defending the idea
that women are inferior to men.

32
00:02:58,557 --> 00:02:59,058
Rubbish.

33
00:02:59,225 --> 00:03:01,694
If you'd let me get a word in...

34
00:03:01,794 --> 00:03:03,062
Who rattled your cage!

35
00:03:16,075 --> 00:03:17,743
Should cut your hands off.

36
00:03:19,145 --> 00:03:21,514
Beating your own mother!

37
00:03:26,118 --> 00:03:28,454
That frock was far too gaudy anyway.

38
00:03:28,754 --> 00:03:31,223
At your age,
you should know what suits you.

39
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:33,359
Can't you stop, you cow?

40
00:03:33,559 --> 00:03:35,861
Wasn't ruining that enough for you?

41
00:03:36,028 --> 00:03:37,496
- I wish...
- What?

42
00:03:39,365 --> 00:03:40,599
You daren't say it?

43
00:03:40,766 --> 00:03:43,102
Don't bother.
I know what you wish.

44
00:03:43,502 --> 00:03:46,305
I could have had a heart attack
from the agitation.

45
00:03:46,539 --> 00:03:48,741
If that's what you want,
go ahead.

46
00:03:49,275 --> 00:03:51,944
Stop it, Mama,
you don't know what you're saying.

47
00:03:52,778 --> 00:03:54,413
There's a real hole here.

48
00:03:55,614 --> 00:03:57,349
Here, too.

49
00:03:58,951 --> 00:04:00,553
Sorry.

50
00:04:00,953 --> 00:04:02,755
But why do you do these things?

51
00:04:03,222 --> 00:04:05,791
Why do you do these things?

52
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,996
I'm sorry.
Truly sorry.

53
00:04:11,363 --> 00:04:12,898
Let me look.

54
00:04:22,942 --> 00:04:24,777
Never mind that.

55
00:04:27,513 --> 00:04:30,483
That's how it is.
We're a hot-blooded family.

56
00:04:31,817 --> 00:04:34,019
Come on, stop crying.

57
00:04:35,554 --> 00:04:37,056
I'll make some coffee.

58
00:04:38,524 --> 00:04:41,360
We'll have a cup together. Okay?

59
00:04:42,228 --> 00:04:43,896
Nothing in life comes free.

60
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:48,000
You'll just have to give
more private lessons.

61
00:04:49,235 --> 00:04:53,205
Your vanity must not
stop us buying our apartment.

62
00:04:53,873 --> 00:04:56,041
You can't contradict me there.

63
00:04:56,842 --> 00:05:00,212
I paid this month's instalment
long ago, don't worry.

64
00:05:03,282 --> 00:05:06,051
In any case,
the dress only cost 6,500.

65
00:05:06,285 --> 00:05:08,854
I'll pay the remainder
back in tomorrow.

66
00:05:09,121 --> 00:05:10,556
I don't understand

67
00:05:10,723 --> 00:05:13,726
why someone of your standing
slaps make-up on

68
00:05:13,993 --> 00:05:16,262
and fritters money away

69
00:05:16,362 --> 00:05:19,165
on frocks that will soon be
out of fashion.

70
00:05:20,499 --> 00:05:24,303
I'd be wearing that dress for years.
The cut was so classical.

71
00:05:24,637 --> 00:05:25,971
It was ageless.

72
00:05:29,542 --> 00:05:31,410
If memory serves me right,

73
00:05:31,544 --> 00:05:34,447
you used to have a dress
just like it. Remember?

74
00:05:34,547 --> 00:05:36,115
You must be dreaming.

75
00:05:36,348 --> 00:05:39,685
It was a designer label.
The finishing was remarkable.

76
00:05:40,853 --> 00:05:43,189
It would have lasted forever.

77
00:05:47,259 --> 00:05:49,562
Do you still need the light?

78
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,416
Did they really annoy you today?

79
00:06:12,218 --> 00:06:14,220
No more than usual.

80
00:06:16,522 --> 00:06:19,725
Did you have the Schober girl?
Isn't Friday her day?

81
00:06:23,629 --> 00:06:24,797
Well?

82
00:06:27,266 --> 00:06:28,934
She's not untalented.

83
00:06:30,002 --> 00:06:32,972
She has a surprising affinity
for Schubert.

84
00:06:37,209 --> 00:06:39,879
Schubert's your department,
don't forget.

85
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,115
That's not for you to say.

86
00:06:44,049 --> 00:06:47,720
You're hardly a judge
of what is my department musically.

87
00:06:48,187 --> 00:06:51,457
If you want your pupils
to have a career instead of you...

88
00:06:51,924 --> 00:06:53,559
Mama...

89
00:06:59,165 --> 00:07:01,801
No one must surpass you, my girl.

90
00:07:03,469 --> 00:07:04,904
No Mama.

91
00:07:06,605 --> 00:07:08,107
Don't be dizzy...

92
00:07:08,841 --> 00:07:09,875
Erika.

93
00:07:12,178 --> 00:07:14,246
Don't worry, Mama.

94
00:07:28,761 --> 00:07:31,230
THE PIANO TEACHER

95
00:07:39,772 --> 00:07:42,108
A little less pedal
wouldn't go amiss.

96
00:07:43,909 --> 00:07:46,679
It's not enough
just to take your foot off.

97
00:07:48,114 --> 00:07:50,282
A note may not be
as long as it is written

98
00:07:50,282 --> 00:07:53,152
and may not be marked
as long as it should be held.

99
00:07:53,986 --> 00:07:56,188
from the novel by ELFRIEDE JELINEK

100
00:07:57,156 --> 00:08:00,226
And two, and three and four...

101
00:08:04,597 --> 00:08:08,634
And one, and two, and three
and four...

102
00:08:08,801 --> 00:08:10,302
And one, and two...

103
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,909
Dogs are barking,

104
00:08:18,144 --> 00:08:20,780
Rattling their chains.

105
00:08:21,747 --> 00:08:24,216
People are sleeping

106
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:26,552
In their beds.

107
00:08:27,953 --> 00:08:30,790
Do you have no ear
for what coldness is?

108
00:08:31,023 --> 00:08:32,758
Or maybe you're just sloppy?

109
00:08:35,828 --> 00:08:37,396
And let go.

110
00:08:39,665 --> 00:08:41,500
And let go.

111
00:08:42,668 --> 00:08:45,104
The music is not purely descriptive.

112
00:08:46,972 --> 00:08:50,309
And it's not drenched
in indifference and sentimentality.

113
00:08:51,343 --> 00:08:52,478
And let go.

114
00:08:52,745 --> 00:08:53,646
You see?

115
00:08:55,748 --> 00:08:59,151
Dogs are barking,

116
00:08:59,985 --> 00:09:03,556
Rattling their chains.

117
00:09:04,323 --> 00:09:07,660
People are sleeping

118
00:09:08,561 --> 00:09:11,430
In their beds.

119
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:51,537
A wrong note in Beethoven
is better than bad interpretation.

120
00:09:53,873 --> 00:09:54,974
You play only phrases.

121
00:09:55,174 --> 00:09:58,944
Ignore the structure
and you'll ruin the sonata.

122
00:10:02,615 --> 00:10:04,583
Back to the top of the page.

123
00:12:02,735 --> 00:12:04,937
I guessed you were for the recital.

124
00:12:05,071 --> 00:12:06,439
Allow me to introduce...

125
00:12:06,772 --> 00:12:08,741
Professor, please, do come in.

126
00:12:09,275 --> 00:12:10,409
Hello, Auntie.

127
00:12:10,543 --> 00:12:12,778
And your mother. Good evening.

128
00:12:12,778 --> 00:12:14,713
You've met my nephew?

129
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:18,217
I was about to introduce myself.
My name's Walter Klemmer.

130
00:14:30,116 --> 00:14:31,584
At the risk of seeming prosaic,

131
00:14:31,817 --> 00:14:35,955
after sampling spiritual
nourishment of such quality,

132
00:14:36,422 --> 00:14:38,991
I've organised,
for the interval, a buffet

133
00:14:39,258 --> 00:14:41,594
to sustain the artists

134
00:14:41,827 --> 00:14:43,796
and, I hope,
for your pleasure, too.

135
00:14:44,196 --> 00:14:44,864
Through here.

136
00:14:59,845 --> 00:15:01,080
My husband's very particular...

137
00:15:01,147 --> 00:15:02,248
Excuse me, Auntie.

138
00:15:02,415 --> 00:15:04,917
Sorry to interrupt but I can't wait.

139
00:15:05,584 --> 00:15:08,421
I hope it's not too forward of me
to kiss the hand

140
00:15:08,487 --> 00:15:09,789
that plays such Bach.

141
00:15:10,122 --> 00:15:11,724
You can stop now.

142
00:15:11,957 --> 00:15:14,693
Where do you get
such unfashionable enthusiasm?

143
00:15:15,327 --> 00:15:18,297
I'm delighted
the tradition of recitals lives on.

144
00:15:18,431 --> 00:15:20,332
It was practically extinct.

145
00:15:20,466 --> 00:15:22,668
The masters die, then their music.

146
00:15:22,868 --> 00:15:25,604
People today
only ever listen to pop or rock.

147
00:15:25,704 --> 00:15:28,407
You're right.
Families like this are no more.

148
00:15:28,407 --> 00:15:30,443
Generations of laryngologists

149
00:15:30,976 --> 00:15:33,212
toiled over Beethoven's
last quartets.

150
00:15:33,646 --> 00:15:36,749
Now, at best, academics
stamp their feet in time

151
00:15:36,816 --> 00:15:39,885
to the trumpety-trumps
of Bruckner.

152
00:15:40,186 --> 00:15:42,254
Disdaining Bruckner is immature,

153
00:15:42,388 --> 00:15:44,356
Mr... Klemmer?

154
00:15:46,058 --> 00:15:50,963
Tell me, what enables you
to talk about music so precociously?

155
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:53,265
Your Aunt said you studied...

156
00:15:53,265 --> 00:15:56,068
Low voltage, professor.
Low voltage.

157
00:15:56,702 --> 00:16:00,172
It was made between 1620 and 1630
by Marcel Pichler.

158
00:16:00,339 --> 00:16:02,308
From Hallein. A rare piece.

159
00:16:03,509 --> 00:16:04,977
Here.

160
00:16:09,081 --> 00:16:10,182
It is played

161
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:13,018
like a cello.

162
00:16:13,319 --> 00:16:16,355
Its common name is
leg viol or quinton.

163
00:16:16,522 --> 00:16:21,727
Recently, I found a painting
that exactly shows this instrument.

164
00:16:22,128 --> 00:16:25,865
Not this type of instrument. I mean,
specifically this instrument.

165
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:30,836
The painting depicts
a concert of viole da gamba

166
00:16:30,903 --> 00:16:35,007
at the court of Duke Augustus
von Braunschweig-Wolfenbuttel.

167
00:16:35,808 --> 00:16:38,644
- Can I fetch you something?
- Not at all. Why?

168
00:16:40,413 --> 00:16:42,214
It's fascinating.

169
00:16:42,915 --> 00:16:44,316
Look at them.

170
00:16:44,417 --> 00:16:47,586
Do they give a fig
about the benefits of illness?

171
00:16:50,723 --> 00:16:52,491
Have you read Adorno

172
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:55,027
on Schumann's Fantasia in C Major?

173
00:16:55,227 --> 00:16:56,195
No.

174
00:16:56,729 --> 00:16:58,764
He talks of his twilight.

175
00:16:59,432 --> 00:17:02,735
It's not Schumann bereft of reason,
but just before.

176
00:17:03,302 --> 00:17:05,071
A fraction before.

177
00:17:05,938 --> 00:17:07,640
He knows he's losing his mind.

178
00:17:08,074 --> 00:17:11,143
It torments him
but he clings on, one last time.

179
00:17:13,512 --> 00:17:16,549
It's being aware
of what it means to lose oneself

180
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:19,185
before being completely abandoned.

181
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:23,189
I'd say you are a good teacher.

182
00:17:24,457 --> 00:17:25,591
Thank you.

183
00:17:26,025 --> 00:17:29,562
You talk about things
as if they were yours. It's rare.

184
00:17:30,329 --> 00:17:32,064
And I think you know it.

185
00:17:32,631 --> 00:17:35,434
Schubert and Schumann
are my favourites, that's all.

186
00:17:35,835 --> 00:17:39,171
Since my father died
completely mad in Steinhof asylum,

187
00:17:40,606 --> 00:17:44,276
I can talk easily about the twilight
of the mind, can't l?

188
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,982
If you'd really prefer not to eat,

189
00:17:50,349 --> 00:17:53,085
perhaps you'd care
for a drink of something?

190
00:17:53,786 --> 00:17:55,087
Go ahead.

191
00:18:04,764 --> 00:18:06,565
I had to sing for my supper.

192
00:18:06,565 --> 00:18:09,969
Dr. Blonsky with his instrument
fetish is such a bore.

193
00:18:10,936 --> 00:18:12,271
Honestly,

194
00:18:12,505 --> 00:18:16,108
Klemmer, or whatever he's called,
seems a bit of a leech?

195
00:18:16,275 --> 00:18:19,211
Walter studies
at the Engineering School.

196
00:18:19,512 --> 00:18:22,214
But his musicality
keeps up with technology,

197
00:18:22,415 --> 00:18:25,484
as you will understand
when you listen to him play.

198
00:18:25,718 --> 00:18:27,153
Over to you, Walter."

199
00:18:33,793 --> 00:18:36,462
My uncle exaggerates shamelessly.

200
00:18:36,662 --> 00:18:40,666
After the professor's performance,
I feel doubly amateur.

201
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:45,104
I had intended to play for you
Schenberg's Opus 33b,

202
00:18:45,237 --> 00:18:49,775
so that my wrong notes
might go unnoticed.

203
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:51,210
Not very funny, I know.

204
00:18:51,677 --> 00:18:55,081
But a discussion of
Schubert and Schumann's madness

205
00:18:55,581 --> 00:18:58,017
left me deeply impressed.

206
00:18:58,184 --> 00:19:00,720
I have decided to drop Schenberg

207
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:03,355
for my favourite piece by Schubert:

208
00:19:03,522 --> 00:19:05,624
the Scherzo
from the Sonata in A Major.

209
00:20:16,128 --> 00:20:19,365
...Dreaming of what they don't
have, replenished of good and bad.

210
00:20:19,698 --> 00:20:21,534
And next morning, all flown away.

211
00:20:21,901 --> 00:20:24,236
And here,
the mood switches to irony.

212
00:20:25,004 --> 00:20:26,772
D... D... D...

213
00:20:27,139 --> 00:20:29,842
So what? So what?

214
00:20:30,276 --> 00:20:32,878
They've had their pleasure.

215
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:34,313
D... D... D...

216
00:20:34,513 --> 00:20:36,782
That's the obstinacy
of the complacent middle-class.

217
00:20:37,183 --> 00:20:40,152
And they hope
that what they left behind

218
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:45,791
Might be waiting for them
on the pillows.

219
00:20:46,192 --> 00:20:47,960
Excuse me, Professor.

220
00:20:48,227 --> 00:20:49,361
Can I have a word?

221
00:20:49,595 --> 00:20:50,563
Go ahead.

222
00:20:50,796 --> 00:20:55,101
Anna says you may not let her play
in the jubilee concert.

223
00:20:55,634 --> 00:20:57,636
I said a soloist
needs more than talent.

224
00:20:58,204 --> 00:20:59,372
She doesn't practice enough?

225
00:21:00,072 --> 00:21:01,273
Only she can tell.

226
00:21:01,507 --> 00:21:03,576
She works 8 hours a day.

227
00:21:03,843 --> 00:21:05,945
It's the end result that counts,
not the hours.

228
00:21:06,212 --> 00:21:09,115
For her, only music counts.
Look at her.

229
00:21:15,454 --> 00:21:17,623
Schubert isn't a walk in the park.

230
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:19,725
I didn't say you wouldn't play.

231
00:21:20,025 --> 00:21:22,328
We'll see how you gel
with the singer.

232
00:21:23,229 --> 00:21:25,698
Excuse me, I have a rehearsal.
Goodbye.

233
00:21:26,365 --> 00:21:27,400
Goodbye.

234
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,168
The Professor is right.

235
00:21:29,435 --> 00:21:32,271
Without total commitment,
you won't get anywhere.

236
00:21:32,471 --> 00:21:34,940
Wipe your nose.
What do you look like?

237
00:21:37,877 --> 00:21:40,079
Your mother wants you to call her.

238
00:21:42,548 --> 00:21:44,216
I've only just arrived.

239
00:21:46,952 --> 00:21:48,954
I don't know.
At least 3 hours.

240
00:21:51,457 --> 00:21:53,492
No! please Mama...

241
00:21:56,695 --> 00:21:58,564
In that case, I'll take a taxi.

242
00:21:59,598 --> 00:22:00,666
Yes!

243
00:22:02,968 --> 00:22:04,670
I'm not a baby.

244
00:22:04,937 --> 00:22:06,405
I have to go now.

245
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:41,407
Can we play the trill the same?
I'll start on the upper note.

246
00:27:03,169 --> 00:27:03,936
Yes!

247
00:27:08,541 --> 00:27:10,142
Sorry to disturb you.

248
00:27:11,544 --> 00:27:12,511
What is it?

249
00:27:13,212 --> 00:27:14,180
Professor Kohut?

250
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:16,582
What do you want?

251
00:27:17,616 --> 00:27:19,919
At the Conservatory,
no one interrupts lessons.

252
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:23,322
I apologise. I am very sorry

253
00:27:23,489 --> 00:27:27,026
but I wanted to come to you
rather than ask just anybody.

254
00:27:27,493 --> 00:27:28,427
About what?

255
00:27:28,828 --> 00:27:31,664
The entrance exam.
I want to join your master class.

256
00:27:32,898 --> 00:27:34,900
That's very flattering, young man.

257
00:27:35,468 --> 00:27:37,403
I hope your interruption

258
00:27:37,737 --> 00:27:40,940
is not to arouse interest
your talents don't merit.

259
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:45,044
Application forms are available
in the secretary's office.

260
00:27:45,311 --> 00:27:47,580
First floor, door 11 .

261
00:27:47,747 --> 00:27:50,850
Please excuse us,
we have work to do.

262
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:52,284
Continue.

263
00:27:54,053 --> 00:27:55,087
Go on.

264
00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:45,504
Mr. Klemmer!

265
00:28:56,549 --> 00:28:57,149
Hello,

266
00:28:57,483 --> 00:29:00,152
- Mr. Walter Klemmer?
- That's correct.

267
00:29:00,352 --> 00:29:01,520
Please...

268
00:29:07,059 --> 00:29:09,128
Your programme
is particularly difficult.

269
00:29:09,362 --> 00:29:11,430
Where do you wish to begin?

270
00:29:11,697 --> 00:29:13,332
Wherever you prefer.

271
00:29:13,632 --> 00:29:17,203
Professor, it's your class
that Mr. Klemmer wishes to join:

272
00:29:17,503 --> 00:29:20,072
which piece
would you like to hear first?

273
00:29:20,373 --> 00:29:22,942
don't mind.
The first on the list.

274
00:29:24,076 --> 00:29:25,544
Go ahead.

275
00:31:54,293 --> 00:31:55,561
Well?

276
00:31:55,728 --> 00:31:57,530
Stunningly brilliant.

277
00:31:58,097 --> 00:32:00,266
No, seriously,
I think it wasn't too bad.

278
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,735
He just put "private lessons".

279
00:32:03,102 --> 00:32:04,637
That's even more remarkable.

280
00:32:05,071 --> 00:32:09,108
I don't know how seriously
he takes his engineering

281
00:32:09,442 --> 00:32:12,211
but for someone whose priority
is not the piano, bravo.

282
00:32:12,611 --> 00:32:13,646
It's amazing.

283
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,449
I quite agree.
He truly is very talented.

284
00:32:16,749 --> 00:32:17,950
Ladies? Gentlemen?

285
00:32:18,317 --> 00:32:20,653
- I vote for.
- Yes, me too.

286
00:32:20,953 --> 00:32:22,354
No doubt about it.

287
00:32:22,688 --> 00:32:24,056
What do you say?

288
00:32:24,457 --> 00:32:28,361
Your opinion counts most.
He's applying to join your class.

289
00:32:29,829 --> 00:32:33,032
After such euphoria,
it's hard to voice reservations.

290
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,969
I can't say
I totally share your enthusiasm.

291
00:32:37,703 --> 00:32:40,373
Clearly he doesn't lack talent
but I wonder,

292
00:32:40,806 --> 00:32:42,942
and I ask you,
what does he expect from us?

293
00:32:43,442 --> 00:32:45,878
For a professional career,
he's too old.

294
00:32:46,579 --> 00:32:50,282
By accepting him, we'll reject
a more motivated student.

295
00:32:51,217 --> 00:32:55,755
And, frankly, I find his histrionics
suspicious or even unpleasant.

296
00:32:56,589 --> 00:32:58,824
I don't see what you mean.

297
00:32:59,592 --> 00:33:03,462
In the Andantino, there were
no histrionics, as you put it.

298
00:33:03,729 --> 00:33:06,599
Everyone knows
our views on Schubert diverge.

299
00:33:06,966 --> 00:33:09,969
Please, let's not waste time.
20 people are waiting.

300
00:33:10,236 --> 00:33:13,239
I feel unable
to nurture the artistic temperament

301
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:14,874
or virtuosity of Mr. Klemmer.

302
00:34:43,529 --> 00:34:44,930
Dinner's ready!

303
00:34:52,638 --> 00:34:54,407
Coming, Mama!

304
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:56,495
Sit down, I'll bring the sauce.

305
00:37:00,232 --> 00:37:02,034
Can I switch off the TV?

306
00:37:02,168 --> 00:37:03,836
If it bothers you.

307
00:37:14,714 --> 00:37:16,549
Don't you like that?

308
00:37:18,951 --> 00:37:20,453
I'm tired.

309
00:37:20,653 --> 00:37:21,887
You look it.

310
00:37:22,321 --> 00:37:24,290
Are the auditions so exhausting?

311
00:37:25,324 --> 00:37:27,393
Boring, rather.

312
00:37:28,461 --> 00:37:30,229
That's tiring, too.

313
00:37:33,399 --> 00:37:34,967
What's wrong with you?

314
00:37:35,768 --> 00:37:37,536
- What do you mean?
- Look.

315
00:37:38,838 --> 00:37:40,906
Is that why you're in a bad mood?

316
00:37:41,507 --> 00:37:43,409
You might be more careful.

317
00:37:44,043 --> 00:37:45,511
It's not very appetising.

318
00:37:46,679 --> 00:37:50,483
Mare on heat seeks ardent,
successful stallion,

319
00:37:50,549 --> 00:37:52,418
for jumping and dressage.

320
00:37:52,752 --> 00:37:53,819
Must be 8 inches.

321
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:55,821
Hello, Mr. Naprawnik.

322
00:37:57,056 --> 00:37:58,357
Hello, teacher

323
00:38:09,135 --> 00:38:10,369
Who's she?

324
00:38:11,637 --> 00:38:13,506
My piano teacher.

325
00:38:17,877 --> 00:38:20,146
Don't pick out
the inner voices so much.

326
00:38:20,513 --> 00:38:22,581
Do you know where the melody is?

327
00:38:26,585 --> 00:38:28,788
It sounds
as clear as a muddy windscreen.

328
00:38:29,388 --> 00:38:32,224
Probably due to the images
lodged in your mind.

329
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:45,271
You have one approach for Bach,
Beethoven and the others.

330
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:50,576
What made you want to study music?

331
00:38:51,143 --> 00:38:54,280
Your meagre talent?
I assure you it's not worth it.

332
00:38:55,147 --> 00:38:57,416
Take a job playing in a strip joint

333
00:38:57,516 --> 00:38:59,418
and stop wasting my time.

334
00:39:00,286 --> 00:39:01,420
Teacher,

335
00:39:01,687 --> 00:39:02,755
What?

336
00:39:04,357 --> 00:39:06,726
- I'm sorry.
- What for?

337
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:10,296
For earlier...
At the newsagents.

338
00:39:12,732 --> 00:39:13,966
Why?

339
00:39:17,002 --> 00:39:18,738
Why are you sorry?

340
00:39:19,472 --> 00:39:20,873
What for?

341
00:39:21,741 --> 00:39:22,875
It doesn't work like that.

342
00:39:23,743 --> 00:39:26,479
Sorry isn't enough,
if I don't know why.

343
00:39:27,947 --> 00:39:30,216
Are you sorry because you're a pig?

344
00:39:30,616 --> 00:39:32,818
Or because your friends are pigs?

345
00:39:33,285 --> 00:39:36,856
Or because all women are bitches
for making you a pig?

346
00:39:37,923 --> 00:39:40,059
Or just because you got caught?

347
00:39:45,364 --> 00:39:46,432
The lesson is ended.

348
00:39:49,368 --> 00:39:51,771
I propose
your mother comes to see me.

349
00:39:52,671 --> 00:39:55,041
Maybe she can shed
some light on this.

350
00:39:56,976 --> 00:39:58,411
Well?

351
00:39:59,345 --> 00:40:01,514
What are you sorry for?

352
00:40:02,515 --> 00:40:04,216
I'm listening.

353
00:40:06,018 --> 00:40:07,720
The silence is deafening.

354
00:40:09,121 --> 00:40:11,724
See you next time,
along with your mother.

355
00:40:11,924 --> 00:40:13,793
Now, please remove yourself.

356
00:40:14,193 --> 00:40:16,362
I'll need my break to recover.

357
00:40:32,011 --> 00:40:32,978
Goodbye.

358
00:41:07,913 --> 00:41:09,015
Yes!

359
00:41:11,884 --> 00:41:13,586
This time I'm expected.

360
00:41:13,753 --> 00:41:15,654
The break's not over yet.

361
00:41:16,255 --> 00:41:18,524
And the lesson hasn't begun.

362
00:41:19,058 --> 00:41:22,094
Can I take out my scores
while I'm waiting?

363
00:41:36,442 --> 00:41:38,444
You know I voted against you?

364
00:41:38,944 --> 00:41:39,945
No.

365
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:43,549
I don't believe
you're serious about music

366
00:41:43,749 --> 00:41:46,318
but rather about the kudos
it brings.

367
00:41:46,485 --> 00:41:48,287
You know that's untrue.

368
00:41:50,823 --> 00:41:52,658
And even if it were true,

369
00:41:52,992 --> 00:41:55,161
would it be such a shameful motive?

370
00:41:56,762 --> 00:41:57,830
Yes.

371
00:42:02,334 --> 00:42:04,203
What have you brought?

372
00:42:06,405 --> 00:42:08,407
You should forget Schubert.

373
00:42:10,443 --> 00:42:13,612
- Schenberg is all...
- I fought to win your attention.

374
00:42:14,613 --> 00:42:15,715
Give me a chance.

375
00:42:15,781 --> 00:42:18,784
I know you're not as indifferent
as you pretend.

376
00:42:19,652 --> 00:42:21,187
I neglected my studies for you.

377
00:42:21,721 --> 00:42:23,189
It's the truth!

378
00:42:23,656 --> 00:42:25,825
You may think it's ridiculous,

379
00:42:26,325 --> 00:42:28,594
but since the recital
at the Blonskys,

380
00:42:29,228 --> 00:42:34,033
I've had you stuck in my mind
like a nut on a bolt.

381
00:42:34,467 --> 00:42:37,103
I apologise for being so technical.

382
00:42:37,970 --> 00:42:39,972
I never intended to apply here.

383
00:42:40,239 --> 00:42:42,174
Stop lying, it won't wash.

384
00:42:43,109 --> 00:42:44,410
I'm not lying.

385
00:42:45,811 --> 00:42:48,280
For next time,
find a copy of Opus 19.

386
00:42:49,048 --> 00:42:50,950
Let's talk first.

387
00:42:52,118 --> 00:42:53,953
I can't see the point.

388
00:42:55,121 --> 00:42:58,491
Don't just stand there.
Sit down and begin.

389
00:43:03,896 --> 00:43:05,731
Is this your last lesson?

390
00:43:05,898 --> 00:43:07,166
Please.

391
00:43:07,333 --> 00:43:10,169
Pretend you have a migraine
or something.

392
00:43:10,336 --> 00:43:11,470
It's lovely out.

393
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:14,740
Either you play
or my migraine will end this lesson.

394
00:45:16,629 --> 00:45:18,230
It's bound to finish late.

395
00:45:18,297 --> 00:45:21,133
Today's
our first Mendelssohn rehearsal.

396
00:45:23,069 --> 00:45:27,740
So, don't call up every 5 minutes.
It's embarrassing.

397
00:45:27,873 --> 00:45:31,410
Viora of the Philharmonic's coming.
He'll think I'm a little girl.

398
00:45:34,647 --> 00:45:35,881
Is that clear?

399
00:45:36,015 --> 00:45:37,483
If it ends late, take a taxi.

400
00:45:39,151 --> 00:45:40,119
Yes Mama.

401
00:45:41,153 --> 00:45:41,821
Goodbye.

402
00:45:44,724 --> 00:45:48,627
I adore lying in the name of love.
I'm so happy for you.

403
00:45:48,794 --> 00:45:51,731
If she calls after 10, don't answer.
Is that okay?

404
00:45:51,831 --> 00:45:53,065
It will be a pleasure.

405
00:46:56,395 --> 00:46:58,898
Good evening, this is Mrs. Kohut.

406
00:46:58,998 --> 00:47:00,366
May I speak to my daughter?

407
00:50:22,335 --> 00:50:23,002
What's wrong?

408
00:50:26,172 --> 00:50:26,806
What the...?

409
00:50:33,145 --> 00:50:34,080
Shit!

410
00:50:37,717 --> 00:50:39,418
Stay there!

411
00:50:41,020 --> 00:50:43,155
Stay there, cunt!

412
00:51:58,564 --> 00:52:00,166
Are you crazy or something?

413
00:52:02,401 --> 00:52:04,403
Your father died this afternoon.

414
00:52:14,814 --> 00:52:16,315
Above all, keep calm.

415
00:54:43,796 --> 00:54:45,765
It's so inconsiderate of you!

416
00:54:45,931 --> 00:54:47,466
Think of the consequences!

417
00:54:47,667 --> 00:54:50,469
Kind of you
to honour us with your presence.

418
00:54:51,303 --> 00:54:53,406
Might we know what kept you?

419
00:54:55,541 --> 00:54:57,777
Stop blubbing! What happened?

420
00:54:59,679 --> 00:55:01,013
I have diarrhoea.

421
00:55:01,547 --> 00:55:03,182
Are you scared or what?

422
00:55:06,185 --> 00:55:08,154
A pianist needs solid nerves.

423
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:10,956
- How can I perform after...
- Don't overdo it.

424
00:55:11,190 --> 00:55:12,758
We should be going up.

425
00:55:15,194 --> 00:55:16,996
Don't be so pathetic.

426
00:55:17,563 --> 00:55:19,765
They won't bite. It's a rehearsal.

427
00:55:22,968 --> 00:55:24,970
Did I overestimate you?

428
01:01:43,215 --> 01:01:47,219
You think me devoid of sensitivity
and indeed I can be superficial.

429
01:01:47,453 --> 01:01:48,921
You see, I admit it.

430
01:01:50,222 --> 01:01:53,526
But telling me to forget Schubert
was atrociously unfair.

431
01:01:53,859 --> 01:01:55,361
It's quite the contrary.

432
01:01:55,594 --> 01:01:58,597
There are days,
like after our first lesson, when...

433
01:02:05,971 --> 01:02:08,474
The sight of blood makes me ill.
Go to her.

434
01:02:08,741 --> 01:02:10,343
Be her brave protector.

435
01:02:19,118 --> 01:02:20,586
- What happened?
- Let me.

436
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:22,588
Call a doctor.

437
01:02:23,255 --> 01:02:26,926
Don't stare, there's nothing to see.
Go back to the hall.

438
01:04:17,770 --> 01:04:19,238
Come on.

439
01:04:21,907 --> 01:04:23,109
Wait.

440
01:04:23,642 --> 01:04:25,177
Why?

441
01:04:26,278 --> 01:04:27,880
Why?

442
01:04:46,432 --> 01:04:47,900
Stop it!

443
01:04:57,877 --> 01:04:59,845
I told you to stop!

444
01:05:00,012 --> 01:05:01,981
If you don't stop immediately,
I'll leave.

445
01:05:09,889 --> 01:05:11,724
Erika...

446
01:05:15,895 --> 01:05:18,030
Look at me, not your penis.

447
01:05:18,764 --> 01:05:20,232
Be quiet.

448
01:05:20,533 --> 01:05:22,635
Don't move or I'll leave.

449
01:05:42,188 --> 01:05:43,422
No.

450
01:05:46,692 --> 01:05:48,427
Erika,
I love you.

451
01:05:48,828 --> 01:05:50,162
No one has...

452
01:05:51,197 --> 01:05:54,600
If you won't be quiet,
you'll end up all alone here.

453
01:05:55,101 --> 01:05:56,268
Why do you hurt me?

454
01:07:01,667 --> 01:07:03,035
I can't hold back.

455
01:07:03,302 --> 01:07:05,071
I said, silence!

456
01:07:06,072 --> 01:07:08,407
Keep going. Come here.

457
01:07:34,467 --> 01:07:36,669
That's it. It's coming.

458
01:07:37,336 --> 01:07:39,405
Keep going. Don't stop!

459
01:07:41,073 --> 01:07:43,676
I'll write down
what you can do to me.

460
01:07:44,210 --> 01:07:47,813
All my desires on paper
for you to peruse at will.

461
01:07:48,347 --> 01:07:49,815
You don't like that?

462
01:07:50,349 --> 01:07:52,151
You can't leave me like this.

463
01:07:52,585 --> 01:07:53,953
Come on.

464
01:07:54,353 --> 01:07:56,689
I've no desire to touch that now.

465
01:07:57,089 --> 01:07:58,324
Keep going, please.

466
01:07:58,724 --> 01:08:00,559
Out of the question!

467
01:08:06,732 --> 01:08:08,034
Hands off.

468
01:08:08,601 --> 01:08:11,437
Or we never see each other again.

469
01:08:14,507 --> 01:08:16,809
It's totally sick
what you're doing here.

470
01:08:17,410 --> 01:08:19,278
And it hurts!

471
01:08:19,912 --> 01:08:21,347
I sympathise.

472
01:08:32,325 --> 01:08:33,659
Stop it.

473
01:08:33,926 --> 01:08:36,162
Don't be stupid.
You're spoiling it.

474
01:08:49,008 --> 01:08:50,743
I won't touch you again.

475
01:08:54,580 --> 01:08:56,983
I want you to stay like that,
that's all.

476
01:08:59,518 --> 01:09:01,187
Facing me!

477
01:09:07,760 --> 01:09:09,595
Don't put it away.

478
01:09:16,402 --> 01:09:17,970
It's not me who's stupid.

479
01:09:19,405 --> 01:09:21,107
It's you.

480
01:09:22,642 --> 01:09:25,111
You should know
what you can and can't do to a man.

481
01:09:25,645 --> 01:09:27,580
- You bitch!
- Shut up!

482
01:09:28,280 --> 01:09:31,384
The playing field has to be level.

483
01:09:32,652 --> 01:09:34,120
If you think...

484
01:09:36,422 --> 01:09:37,623
Wait.

485
01:09:39,291 --> 01:09:41,093
I won't move, I promise.

486
01:09:42,061 --> 01:09:43,529
I won't say a word.

487
01:11:03,142 --> 01:11:05,244
You will receive my instructions.

488
01:11:06,145 --> 01:11:07,546
By letter.

489
01:11:08,748 --> 01:11:11,283
Or face to face.
Or maybe over the phone.

490
01:11:14,387 --> 01:11:16,288
Now, you can put it away.

491
01:11:17,657 --> 01:11:19,125
Facing me.

492
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:16,849
How about a little smile?

493
01:12:18,250 --> 01:12:19,585
Go on.

494
01:12:20,252 --> 01:12:22,688
Don't be so serious, pretty lady.

495
01:12:24,123 --> 01:12:25,591
Go on.

496
01:12:44,443 --> 01:12:47,246
Next time, we'll do much better.
I promise.

497
01:12:49,081 --> 01:12:51,450
Practice will make you perfect.

498
01:12:53,452 --> 01:12:57,156
At least 2 months, with no guarantee
of complete recovery.

499
01:12:57,723 --> 01:12:59,091
That's terrible.

500
01:12:59,725 --> 01:13:04,063
And she really was quite good.
She has the nerve.

501
01:13:04,363 --> 01:13:08,601
She played amazingly yesterday
despite nearly not making it.

502
01:13:10,870 --> 01:13:13,139
Pull yourself together.
You're no use to Anna

503
01:13:13,472 --> 01:13:15,408
if you break down like that.

504
01:13:18,611 --> 01:13:20,579
For the moment, we must wait.

505
01:13:21,380 --> 01:13:23,215
She mustn't neglect her left hand.

506
01:13:23,482 --> 01:13:25,484
That's always her weak point.

507
01:13:25,885 --> 01:13:27,853
Also, she'll be scarred for life.

508
01:13:28,120 --> 01:13:30,890
Just imagine.
A pianist with a disfigured hand.

509
01:13:31,123 --> 01:13:33,092
She's hardly attractive.
Her only attribute

510
01:13:33,259 --> 01:13:34,727
was her talent.

511
01:13:35,394 --> 01:13:37,496
That's why we sacrificed everything.

512
01:13:37,897 --> 01:13:39,832
She sacrificed everything.

513
01:13:40,900 --> 01:13:42,268
Sorry?

514
01:13:42,802 --> 01:13:45,871
You said we.
It's Anna who sacrificed everything.

515
01:13:46,305 --> 01:13:47,807
Yes, naturally.

516
01:13:48,407 --> 01:13:50,076
Who would do such a thing?

517
01:13:50,676 --> 01:13:53,846
The police say it must have been
another student

518
01:13:54,180 --> 01:13:55,581
acting out of jealousy.

519
01:13:57,817 --> 01:13:59,885
Can you imagine it?

520
01:14:00,319 --> 01:14:02,121
Being so evil?

521
01:14:03,022 --> 01:14:06,292
She's always been a loner.
She hardly has any friends.

522
01:14:06,525 --> 01:14:08,794
They'll find the man who did it.

523
01:14:09,195 --> 01:14:11,564
He deserves his hands chopping off.

524
01:14:11,931 --> 01:14:16,569
My next lesson is waiting.
I'll have to ask you to leave.

525
01:14:16,836 --> 01:14:20,039
Tell Anna she's welcome to drop in
when she's better.

526
01:14:25,578 --> 01:14:27,713
Remind her about her left hand.

527
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:30,616
I'll tell her.
Thank you very much.

528
01:14:31,350 --> 01:14:33,786
She'll come by.
She admires you so much.

529
01:14:33,953 --> 01:14:35,788
Chin up, Mrs. Schober.

530
01:14:37,890 --> 01:14:40,259
Who will replace Anna
for the concert?

531
01:14:41,027 --> 01:14:42,261
No one.

532
01:14:42,895 --> 01:14:45,164
No student could
at such short notice.

533
01:14:46,032 --> 01:14:49,001
I've been asked to stand in
for the singer's sake.

534
01:14:49,268 --> 01:14:51,437
That's very good.
Anna will be pleased.

535
01:14:51,671 --> 01:14:52,872
Goodbye teacher.

536
01:16:09,849 --> 01:16:11,083
Stop.

537
01:16:17,990 --> 01:16:19,325
Back to the beginning.

538
01:16:26,599 --> 01:16:29,769
You gladly ignore the dynamics.
What does it say?

539
01:16:30,603 --> 01:16:32,872
- Piano.
- Exactly. And then?

540
01:16:34,874 --> 01:16:36,242
Forte-piano.

541
01:16:36,509 --> 01:16:37,610
And then?

542
01:16:37,877 --> 01:16:38,678
Pianissimo.

543
01:16:38,944 --> 01:16:40,046
And diminuendo

544
01:16:40,513 --> 01:16:41,981
and mezzo-forte, forte,

545
01:16:42,248 --> 01:16:44,684
fortissimo, sforzatissimo.

546
01:16:44,817 --> 01:16:48,521
Schubert's dynamics range from
scream to whisper not loud to soft.

547
01:16:48,988 --> 01:16:52,591
Anarchy hardly seems your forte.
Why not stick to Clementi?

548
01:16:52,892 --> 01:16:55,761
Schubert was quite ugly.
Did you know?

549
01:16:56,929 --> 01:16:59,665
With your looks,
nothing can ever hurt you.

550
01:16:59,732 --> 01:17:02,201
Why destroy
what could bring us together?

551
01:17:06,605 --> 01:17:09,442
- Mannerism is no...
- Why can't I look at you?

552
01:17:09,976 --> 01:17:14,146
Because if I do, I won't resist the
temptation to kiss you on the neck.

553
01:17:15,414 --> 01:17:17,783
May I kiss you on the neck?

554
01:17:38,804 --> 01:17:40,840
Can I get you a glass of water?

555
01:18:01,394 --> 01:18:02,695
Thanks.

556
01:18:04,497 --> 01:18:06,265
When can I see you?

557
01:18:07,833 --> 01:18:09,035
Let's call each other.

558
01:18:10,403 --> 01:18:12,371
Let's go away this weekend.
Just you and l.

559
01:18:13,005 --> 01:18:15,107
I can't,
I'm going out with my mother.

560
01:18:15,274 --> 01:18:16,375
Cancel.

561
01:18:16,642 --> 01:18:18,978
Forget your mother. Think of us.

562
01:18:19,278 --> 01:18:20,913
We must make up for lost time.

563
01:18:21,080 --> 01:18:23,949
Do you mean me?
I must make up for lost time?

564
01:18:24,417 --> 01:18:27,053
Darling!
Stop always thinking of others,

565
01:18:27,286 --> 01:18:29,455
your mother, your scruples...

566
01:18:30,089 --> 01:18:33,492
You talk of anarchy
but sacrifice love to be with Mama.

567
01:18:34,160 --> 01:18:37,430
Let yourself go.
Allow yourself feelings for once.

568
01:18:37,730 --> 01:18:39,332
Don't be such a leech.

569
01:18:45,438 --> 01:18:47,139
You cough because you're uptight.

570
01:18:47,373 --> 01:18:49,875
I have no feelings.
Get that into your head.

571
01:18:50,142 --> 01:18:53,079
If ever I do,
they won't defeat my intelligence.

572
01:18:54,947 --> 01:18:56,983
I love you.
Don't be so cowardly.

573
01:18:58,584 --> 01:19:01,320
Is what you've written
just as cowardly?

574
01:19:05,858 --> 01:19:07,326
Don't touch it!

575
01:19:07,860 --> 01:19:09,295
Not now.

576
01:19:10,529 --> 01:19:13,065
I want you to read it alone.

577
01:19:15,301 --> 01:19:17,269
Now, get stuck in to Schubert.

578
01:19:17,536 --> 01:19:20,006
That's all you may do in this room.

579
01:19:35,788 --> 01:19:37,189
Piano.

580
01:19:38,858 --> 01:19:41,527
Brahms would say:
Con intimissimo sentimento.

581
01:20:34,146 --> 01:20:35,481
Erika!

582
01:20:42,221 --> 01:20:44,123
Are you mad? What are you doing?

583
01:20:44,390 --> 01:20:46,092
I followed you.

584
01:20:46,359 --> 01:20:48,160
I said we'd speak on the phone.

585
01:20:48,361 --> 01:20:51,430
You can't drive me crazy like that
and then run off.

586
01:20:52,231 --> 01:20:54,066
Drive you crazy?

587
01:20:54,367 --> 01:20:58,170
Let's go somewhere
where we can talk in private.

588
01:21:00,306 --> 01:21:02,141
Did you read the letter?

589
01:21:03,175 --> 01:21:05,945
I don't want any letters.
I want us to talk!

590
01:21:08,414 --> 01:21:10,282
I advise you to leave now.

591
01:21:12,551 --> 01:21:14,854
Never hound the woman
you claim to love.

592
01:21:15,187 --> 01:21:17,490
You should know that,
even at your age.

593
01:21:18,124 --> 01:21:19,959
If you value my affection, go.

594
01:21:20,326 --> 01:21:23,329
I'll call you tomorrow
to fix a date. Okay?

595
01:21:23,829 --> 01:21:25,631
- Take your hat off.
- What?

596
01:21:57,863 --> 01:21:59,198
Good evening.

597
01:21:59,732 --> 01:22:02,535
I have matters to discuss
with Mr. Klemmer.

598
01:22:03,469 --> 01:22:05,304
What's that supposed to mean?

599
01:22:05,671 --> 01:22:08,341
We won't bother you.
We'll talk in my room.

600
01:22:08,607 --> 01:22:09,508
Come on.

601
01:22:11,110 --> 01:22:12,011
Excuse me.

602
01:22:12,745 --> 01:22:15,281
If you try to come in,
you'll be sorry.

603
01:22:15,881 --> 01:22:18,084
There's no food in.
I didn't expect visitors.

604
01:22:18,551 --> 01:22:21,087
Don't put yourself out,
I've already eaten.

605
01:23:02,228 --> 01:23:03,262
Come here.

606
01:23:09,235 --> 01:23:10,903
First, read the letter.

607
01:23:16,342 --> 01:23:17,543
You've still got it?

608
01:23:17,543 --> 01:23:18,077
Yes.

609
01:23:19,912 --> 01:23:21,914
So, read it now, please.

610
01:23:22,682 --> 01:23:24,417
Do you want to finish me off?

611
01:23:25,184 --> 01:23:27,553
I said
I don't want to read any letters.

612
01:23:28,187 --> 01:23:30,056
I'm here, you're here.

613
01:23:30,556 --> 01:23:32,491
We're made of flesh and blood.

614
01:23:34,627 --> 01:23:36,562
Don't be so scared.

615
01:23:36,762 --> 01:23:39,765
I'm not. I want all you want.
But read it first.

616
01:23:45,538 --> 01:23:47,640
Is that why we barricaded the door?

617
01:23:48,040 --> 01:23:48,941
Perhaps.

618
01:23:50,276 --> 01:23:51,510
Erika...

619
01:23:51,844 --> 01:23:52,945
Please!

620
01:23:54,480 --> 01:23:57,850
I don't know how much longer
I want to play this game.

621
01:24:10,496 --> 01:24:11,464
Heavy.

622
01:24:13,432 --> 01:24:15,334
Sit down there, please.

623
01:25:38,250 --> 01:25:41,387
On the contrary, if I beg,
tighten my bonds, please.

624
01:25:42,622 --> 01:25:45,858
Adjust the belt
by at least 2 or 3 holes.

625
01:25:46,459 --> 01:25:48,327
The tighter the better.

626
01:25:49,261 --> 01:25:53,032
Then, gag me with some
stockings I will have ready.

627
01:25:54,700 --> 01:25:57,503
tuff them in so hard
that I'm incapable...

628
01:25:58,004 --> 01:26:00,106
of making any sound.

629
01:26:01,907 --> 01:26:04,243
Next, take off the blindfold,
please,

630
01:26:05,211 --> 01:26:07,613
and sit down on my face

631
01:26:09,015 --> 01:26:11,517
and punch me in the stomach

632
01:26:12,351 --> 01:26:15,688
to force me
to thrust my tongue in your behind.

633
01:26:37,076 --> 01:26:38,978
Is this supposed to be serious?

634
01:26:41,447 --> 01:26:43,382
You're making fun of me, aren't you?

635
01:26:45,751 --> 01:26:47,219
You want a slap?

636
01:27:07,873 --> 01:27:09,809
For that is my dearest wish.

637
01:27:09,809 --> 01:27:12,712
Hands and feet tied behind my back

638
01:27:13,045 --> 01:27:15,114
and locked up next door
to my mother

639
01:27:15,381 --> 01:27:19,251
but out of her reach
behind my bedroom door,

640
01:27:19,685 --> 01:27:21,253
till the next morning.

641
01:27:22,488 --> 01:27:25,291
Don't worry about my mother,
she's my problem.

642
01:27:27,059 --> 01:27:30,463
Take all the door keys
with you from the apartment.

643
01:27:30,763 --> 01:27:32,798
Don't leave a single one here.

644
01:27:32,999 --> 01:27:35,501
What will all this open up for me?

645
01:27:43,609 --> 01:27:47,380
Maybe you'd open your cultured
mouth and comment on this shit.

646
01:27:47,680 --> 01:27:48,247
No?

647
01:28:06,198 --> 01:28:09,669
If you catch me
disobeying any of your orders,

648
01:28:10,436 --> 01:28:12,571
hit me, please,

649
01:28:13,072 --> 01:28:15,608
even with the back of your hand
on my face.

650
01:28:18,844 --> 01:28:21,347
Ask me why I don't cry out
to mother

651
01:28:21,614 --> 01:28:24,483
or why I don't fight back.

652
01:28:24,817 --> 01:28:27,086
Above all, say things like that,

653
01:28:27,620 --> 01:28:30,890
so that I realise
just how powerless I am.

654
01:28:31,691 --> 01:28:33,559
What's going on in there?

655
01:28:33,826 --> 01:28:35,861
Open up! Move that chest.

656
01:28:35,928 --> 01:28:37,763
Don't you want to let her in?

657
01:28:37,863 --> 01:28:39,899
Do you want me
to hit you in front of her?

658
01:28:40,433 --> 01:28:43,769
Calm down!
Be quiet and watch the TV!

659
01:28:43,936 --> 01:28:45,638
Open up or you'll be sorry.

660
01:28:45,771 --> 01:28:46,839
Stop making a fuss!

661
01:28:46,973 --> 01:28:48,307
Incredible!

662
01:28:49,375 --> 01:28:50,876
Erika!

663
01:28:55,181 --> 01:28:57,483
Do you have no sense of decency?

664
01:28:57,750 --> 01:28:59,852
Invading people's homes like this.

665
01:29:00,052 --> 01:29:02,188
The sheer nerve of it!

666
01:31:18,190 --> 01:31:20,026
Are you angry with me?

667
01:31:22,695 --> 01:31:24,463
I hope you're not.

668
01:31:25,698 --> 01:31:28,234
It's not very well written, I know.

669
01:31:29,135 --> 01:31:32,305
I'm a pianist, not a poet.

670
01:31:34,340 --> 01:31:37,310
After all,
love is built on banal things.

671
01:31:40,947 --> 01:31:43,983
Think it over.
You have my phone number.

672
01:31:48,654 --> 01:31:51,757
Like I said,
I want everything you want.

673
01:31:53,259 --> 01:31:54,994
I have all we need.

674
01:31:59,465 --> 01:32:01,767
But it can wait till tomorrow.

675
01:32:10,009 --> 01:32:11,510
Aren't you talking to me?

676
01:32:17,650 --> 01:32:19,652
Do I disgust you?

677
01:32:22,088 --> 01:32:24,023
That's not necessary.

678
01:32:25,458 --> 01:32:28,327
The urge to be beaten
has been in me for years.

679
01:32:34,967 --> 01:32:36,902
I waited for you, you know?

680
01:32:40,873 --> 01:32:43,476
It's not a joke, all I wrote.
You know that.

681
01:32:46,445 --> 01:32:48,848
From now on, you give the orders.

682
01:32:52,785 --> 01:32:55,921
From now on,
you choose what I am to wear.

683
01:32:56,522 --> 01:32:58,891
What colour do you prefer?
You never said.

684
01:33:03,663 --> 01:33:05,798
You're not talking to me?
You're angry?

685
01:33:11,337 --> 01:33:12,872
Say something then.

686
01:33:15,174 --> 01:33:16,375
You're sick.

687
01:33:17,877 --> 01:33:19,512
You need treatment.

688
01:33:31,390 --> 01:33:33,426
If you want to hit me, hit me.

689
01:33:36,662 --> 01:33:38,731
I don't want to soil my hands.

690
01:33:40,533 --> 01:33:43,636
No one would touch your sort,
even with gloves on.

691
01:33:53,412 --> 01:33:55,348
I swear I loved you.

692
01:33:57,283 --> 01:33:59,485
You don't even know what it is.

693
01:34:01,187 --> 01:34:03,356
Right now, you repulse me.

694
01:34:07,193 --> 01:34:08,761
Fuck it.

695
01:34:25,077 --> 01:34:27,613
...came to North America
with the Spanish.

696
01:34:27,813 --> 01:34:30,583
Left to roam free,
they became the famous Mustang.

697
01:34:30,950 --> 01:34:34,920
Today's cowboys' most loyal
companion is the quarter horse.

698
01:34:35,087 --> 01:34:39,392
Very fast over short distances
and with good stamina...

699
01:35:16,028 --> 01:35:18,130
You really are quite shameless.

700
01:35:22,168 --> 01:35:24,203
What have you done with him?

701
01:35:26,939 --> 01:35:28,841
Is he still in your room?

702
01:35:31,444 --> 01:35:33,379
It wouldn't surprise me.

703
01:35:35,147 --> 01:35:37,249
Nothing surprises me any more.

704
01:35:45,558 --> 01:35:47,326
But you can do what you want.

705
01:35:47,960 --> 01:35:49,328
At your age.

706
01:35:58,671 --> 01:36:00,006
Good Lord.

707
01:36:02,541 --> 01:36:04,644
All those sacrifices for this.

708
01:36:07,413 --> 01:36:09,649
That's what you get in reward.

709
01:36:16,789 --> 01:36:18,924
You carry on like that.

710
01:36:19,292 --> 01:36:22,428
You can set up a bordello here.

711
01:36:24,030 --> 01:36:26,499
Who cares
what the neighbours think!

712
01:36:27,300 --> 01:36:29,302
As always, you do as you like!

713
01:36:29,802 --> 01:36:31,170
I love you.

714
01:36:31,804 --> 01:36:34,173
Stop that! Have you gone insane?

715
01:36:35,041 --> 01:36:36,375
What are you...

716
01:36:37,043 --> 01:36:38,511
Stop it!

717
01:36:39,679 --> 01:36:43,015
Don't be so filthy,
you're out of your mind!

718
01:36:43,416 --> 01:36:45,851
Shut up. I love you.

719
01:36:46,552 --> 01:36:48,154
I love you, too.

720
01:36:49,322 --> 01:36:51,390
But stop this now.

721
01:36:54,560 --> 01:36:55,895
You're mad!

722
01:37:39,138 --> 01:37:40,840
You're mad.

723
01:37:42,508 --> 01:37:44,243
You're completely mad.

724
01:37:56,656 --> 01:37:58,491
Go to sleep now.

725
01:38:01,794 --> 01:38:04,397
You're going to need
all your energy.

726
01:38:06,899 --> 01:38:10,369
Even if you're just standing in,
you must be well prepared.

727
01:38:12,805 --> 01:38:15,341
You never know
who might be in the audience.

728
01:38:46,072 --> 01:38:48,574
I saw the hairs on your sex.

729
01:40:06,652 --> 01:40:07,853
Walter!

730
01:40:08,154 --> 01:40:09,588
Can I have a word?

731
01:40:09,889 --> 01:40:11,791
Someone to see you.

732
01:40:14,627 --> 01:40:16,829
Is that your little sister?

733
01:40:17,263 --> 01:40:18,998
Don't run away, he's coming.

734
01:40:29,775 --> 01:40:31,744
- What do you want?
- Speak to you.

735
01:40:33,145 --> 01:40:34,447
I'm listening.

736
01:40:35,514 --> 01:40:37,283
Not here, I can't.

737
01:40:38,284 --> 01:40:39,518
Over there.

738
01:40:43,789 --> 01:40:45,858
How did you manage to find me?

739
01:40:48,294 --> 01:40:49,528
Just there.

740
01:40:50,396 --> 01:40:51,731
Go on in.

741
01:40:59,672 --> 01:41:01,741
Forgive me for the letter.

742
01:41:02,908 --> 01:41:07,079
I'm an idiot. I shouldn't have
done that to you out of the blue.

743
01:41:09,415 --> 01:41:11,717
Like you said,
we should have talked first.

744
01:41:21,894 --> 01:41:23,496
Forgive me.

745
01:41:27,900 --> 01:41:29,235
What are you doing?

746
01:41:29,902 --> 01:41:32,104
Stop it. Get up now.

747
01:41:32,638 --> 01:41:33,973
Come on.

748
01:41:35,274 --> 01:41:36,575
Come on top of me.

749
01:41:37,910 --> 01:41:40,212
- You want me, don't you?
- You're mad.

750
01:41:41,547 --> 01:41:43,816
Come on. I love you.

751
01:41:45,418 --> 01:41:47,920
I'll never write anything
you don't want.

752
01:41:48,554 --> 01:41:50,856
You tell me what you want, okay?

753
01:41:51,657 --> 01:41:52,892
come!

754
01:41:53,059 --> 01:41:55,895
Someone might come in.
You're being ridiculous.

755
01:41:56,162 --> 01:41:57,763
Get up.

756
01:42:04,403 --> 01:42:06,138
Hang on, let me do it.

757
01:42:07,506 --> 01:42:09,375
Let me do it, I said.

758
01:42:13,779 --> 01:42:15,281
wait!

759
01:42:19,418 --> 01:42:20,920
Here.

760
01:42:32,164 --> 01:42:33,666
I can't, not here.

761
01:42:33,733 --> 01:42:35,334
Stop it. I can't.

762
01:42:36,135 --> 01:42:38,704
- It doesn't matter.
- I can't do it here.

763
01:42:43,075 --> 01:42:45,544
I know you want to protect us,

764
01:42:45,645 --> 01:42:49,248
but I don't care if people catch us.
I don't care.

765
01:42:49,782 --> 01:42:51,250
I love you.

766
01:43:08,301 --> 01:43:09,769
I love you, too.

767
01:43:24,583 --> 01:43:26,185
Come on.

768
01:43:37,697 --> 01:43:39,165
You have to help me.

769
01:44:12,598 --> 01:44:15,334
- I don't believe it.
- I'm sorry.

770
01:44:17,970 --> 01:44:19,405
Don't look.

771
01:44:22,108 --> 01:44:23,909
Don't look.

772
01:44:42,228 --> 01:44:44,196
I must really disgust you.

773
01:44:44,363 --> 01:44:47,133
- No woman ever puked it back.
- Sorry.

774
01:44:47,233 --> 01:44:49,535
I don't know what happened.

775
01:44:53,839 --> 01:44:55,374
I'm clean.

776
01:45:00,513 --> 01:45:01,814
I'm all clean.

777
01:45:03,015 --> 01:45:04,283
Like a baby.

778
01:45:05,751 --> 01:45:07,586
Inside as well as outside.

779
01:45:07,653 --> 01:45:09,989
For you and thanks to you, darling.

780
01:45:11,324 --> 01:45:13,492
Do you like me calling you darling?

781
01:45:13,693 --> 01:45:15,528
It's absolutely marvellous.

782
01:45:16,195 --> 01:45:17,964
You must be patient.

783
01:45:18,030 --> 01:45:21,567
I'll give you all the names,
we'll play all the games you want.

784
01:45:23,035 --> 01:45:24,670
You know you really stink?

785
01:45:26,772 --> 01:45:30,610
Sorry, you stink so much,
no one will ever come close to you.

786
01:45:30,710 --> 01:45:34,513
You'd better leave town
until you don't stink so bad.

787
01:45:35,915 --> 01:45:37,483
Rinse your mouth more often,

788
01:45:37,550 --> 01:45:39,852
not just when my cock
makes you puke.

789
01:46:25,131 --> 01:46:26,165
Who is it?

790
01:46:26,332 --> 01:46:27,166
Open up.

791
01:46:28,968 --> 01:46:31,003
- Open up now!
- What do you want?

792
01:46:32,571 --> 01:46:34,106
I said, open the door!

793
01:46:36,275 --> 01:46:38,511
Quiet!
You'll wake the whole building.

794
01:46:38,711 --> 01:46:39,912
I'm opening it.

795
01:46:46,285 --> 01:46:47,386
Don't do that again, okay?

796
01:46:47,486 --> 01:46:51,023
- What do you mean?
- Shut up, you sad cow!

797
01:46:52,158 --> 01:46:53,793
Just then,

798
01:46:53,926 --> 01:46:55,761
I was under your window

799
01:46:55,861 --> 01:47:00,232
and I was jerking off.
That's what you want, huh?

800
01:47:00,366 --> 01:47:03,102
You want to...
Is that it?

801
01:47:05,071 --> 01:47:08,808
You're a witch, a pervert!

802
01:47:09,709 --> 01:47:12,778
You want to give everyone
your illness, don't you?

803
01:47:13,045 --> 01:47:14,347
- Not me!
- I did apologise.

804
01:47:14,614 --> 01:47:16,549
Fuck your stupid apologies!

805
01:47:16,782 --> 01:47:19,151
Wasn't last night enough for you?

806
01:47:19,485 --> 01:47:23,189
Will you make this a habit?
Screaming the house down.

807
01:47:23,422 --> 01:47:24,890
Go back to bed!

808
01:47:25,124 --> 01:47:26,092
Walter, please.

809
01:47:26,292 --> 01:47:28,527
- Get out!
- Be off with you! Now!

810
01:47:28,728 --> 01:47:30,129
Not as you imagined?

811
01:47:30,363 --> 01:47:31,931
We'll see about this.

812
01:47:32,164 --> 01:47:34,467
The police will put a stop to this.

813
01:47:35,434 --> 01:47:37,436
This is nothing to do with you.

814
01:47:42,875 --> 01:47:44,377
Forget your mother.

815
01:47:44,877 --> 01:47:47,313
We have time. We have all night.

816
01:47:52,251 --> 01:47:54,387
Let's pick up where we left off.

817
01:47:54,921 --> 01:47:57,189
Is this really
what you had imagined?

818
01:47:58,124 --> 01:47:58,958
No.

819
01:47:59,692 --> 01:48:01,294
What then?

820
01:48:01,994 --> 01:48:03,062
You'll be sorry.

821
01:48:03,195 --> 01:48:06,232
Just because we're women doesn't
mean you'll get away with it.

822
01:48:06,766 --> 01:48:07,633
Let me go.

823
01:48:11,103 --> 01:48:12,571
This is unbelievable!

824
01:48:13,739 --> 01:48:16,075
At least this one has a key.

825
01:48:16,876 --> 01:48:17,510
Open up!

826
01:48:17,810 --> 01:48:20,179
How about one
for your daughter's room?

827
01:48:20,546 --> 01:48:21,147
Open up!

828
01:48:22,548 --> 01:48:24,216
That's that dealt with.

829
01:48:25,685 --> 01:48:29,789
As for my mother,
pay no attention to her. Yes?

830
01:48:31,424 --> 01:48:33,392
Am I quoting you exactly?

831
01:48:35,428 --> 01:48:36,896
Open up!

832
01:48:38,898 --> 01:48:40,132
You will see!

833
01:48:47,206 --> 01:48:48,741
Give me lots of slaps, darling.

834
01:48:51,143 --> 01:48:52,411
Hit me hard... No.

835
01:48:52,578 --> 01:48:55,081
Hit me around the face
and hit me hard.

836
01:48:59,518 --> 01:49:01,420
At your service, dear lady.

837
01:49:07,693 --> 01:49:09,328
Is that what you want?

838
01:49:09,462 --> 01:49:10,329
Stop, please.

839
01:49:13,266 --> 01:49:14,233
What then?

840
01:49:14,467 --> 01:49:17,003
Not that. Stop, I beg you.

841
01:49:24,076 --> 01:49:25,945
What are you doing?

842
01:49:26,078 --> 01:49:27,780
- Shut it or I kill her!
- Murderer!

843
01:49:28,214 --> 01:49:29,582
Stop.

844
01:49:34,687 --> 01:49:36,889
- Where's the water?
- In the kitchen.

845
01:49:41,627 --> 01:49:43,496
Don't think you'll get me going...

846
01:49:43,763 --> 01:49:45,798
by flashing your pathetic body.

847
01:50:02,815 --> 01:50:04,383
You know,

848
01:50:04,650 --> 01:50:07,820
I do realise
that all this isn't very nice of me.

849
01:50:10,690 --> 01:50:14,527
But if you're honest, you'll admit
you're partly responsible.

850
01:50:17,096 --> 01:50:19,498
I mean, it's true...

851
01:50:19,899 --> 01:50:21,100
Yes or no?

852
01:50:21,467 --> 01:50:22,068
Yes.

853
01:50:22,468 --> 01:50:23,970
Am I right?

854
01:50:24,470 --> 01:50:25,705
Yes, Walter.

855
01:50:30,276 --> 01:50:31,644
Erika?

856
01:50:31,911 --> 01:50:32,912
Yes.

857
01:50:33,145 --> 01:50:36,315
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay

858
01:50:36,415 --> 01:50:39,619
You can't get a guy going,
then take refuge on the ice.

859
01:50:57,703 --> 01:50:59,805
Not my face! Not my hands!

860
01:51:01,073 --> 01:51:02,642
Murderer!

861
01:51:04,143 --> 01:51:05,911
Aren't you ashamed?

862
01:51:07,346 --> 01:51:09,448
I'm begging you to stop.

863
01:51:10,917 --> 01:51:12,852
Don't touch my daughter.

864
01:51:14,854 --> 01:51:17,290
Leave my daughter alone.

865
01:51:19,058 --> 01:51:21,093
I'm begging you.

866
01:51:21,661 --> 01:51:23,696
Why do you do that?

867
01:51:24,263 --> 01:51:27,967
I calm down
and you try to cross me.

868
01:51:29,268 --> 01:51:31,404
Be a little cooperative, fuck it.

869
01:51:34,974 --> 01:51:37,476
I'd be happy to learn to play.

870
01:51:38,344 --> 01:51:41,147
But not if we only ever play
by your rules.

871
01:51:43,616 --> 01:51:46,919
You can't delve around
inside people, then reject them.

872
01:51:59,732 --> 01:52:02,335
Be nice to me, please.

873
01:52:07,206 --> 01:52:09,475
You can't let me go just like that.

874
01:53:39,899 --> 01:53:41,500
Stop, please.

875
01:53:42,034 --> 01:53:44,170
You have to give a bit.

876
01:54:11,697 --> 01:54:14,033
You can't leave me all alone now.

877
01:54:14,700 --> 01:54:16,435
Love me, please.

878
01:54:43,863 --> 01:54:46,532
Are you trying to tell me
I should go?

879
01:55:50,763 --> 01:55:53,599
I'd appreciate it
if you tell no one.

880
01:55:55,234 --> 01:55:57,603
Anyhow, it's for your own good.

881
01:56:03,542 --> 01:56:05,811
You can't humiliate
a man that way and...

882
01:56:06,746 --> 01:56:08,414
It's not possible.

883
01:56:19,225 --> 01:56:20,927
Will you be alright?

884
01:56:25,097 --> 01:56:27,066
Do you need anything?

885
01:56:27,433 --> 01:56:28,668
Okay?

886
01:56:30,736 --> 01:56:33,572
You know, love isn't everything.

887
01:56:37,443 --> 01:56:38,778
See you, then.

888
01:56:49,555 --> 01:56:51,357
Has he gone?

889
01:56:52,358 --> 01:56:54,327
Say something. Has he gone?

890
01:56:56,062 --> 01:56:57,463
Erika.

891
01:56:57,630 --> 01:56:59,098
Open the door.

892
01:57:00,866 --> 01:57:02,268
What's wrong?

893
01:57:03,369 --> 01:57:04,971
Talk to me, for God's sake.

894
01:57:38,871 --> 01:57:40,706
Oh my God, child!

895
01:57:40,873 --> 01:57:42,575
What a state you're in!

896
01:57:43,142 --> 01:57:44,911
What did the bastard do to you?

897
01:57:51,584 --> 01:57:53,853
Hurry, we'll miss the tram.

898
01:57:54,053 --> 01:57:56,022
I'm just having a glass of water.

899
01:58:01,427 --> 01:58:02,194
Don't be so nervous.

900
01:58:03,229 --> 01:58:04,630
It's only to replace someone.

901
01:58:39,732 --> 01:58:41,300
Good evening professor!

902
01:58:41,434 --> 01:58:44,236
I'm so looking forward
to your Schubert.

903
01:58:44,370 --> 01:58:49,408
I think I should go and take
my seat. It begins in 8 minutes.

904
01:58:49,508 --> 01:58:50,810
I'll come up with you.

905
01:58:51,244 --> 01:58:55,214
Good evening,
I'm delighted to see you here.

906
01:58:55,448 --> 01:58:59,051
What about our convalescent?
She doesn't lack courage.

907
01:58:59,185 --> 01:59:02,421
She insisted on coming tonight.
To hear you play.

908
01:59:03,055 --> 01:59:04,523
Good evening.

909
01:59:04,624 --> 01:59:06,559
How are you feeling?

910
01:59:06,626 --> 01:59:08,794
Sorry, let me introduce myself.

911
01:59:08,894 --> 01:59:11,297
I'm Mrs. Schober.
My daughter, Anna

912
01:59:12,698 --> 01:59:14,433
This is my mother.

913
01:59:14,533 --> 01:59:17,803
Lovely to meet you. You must be
very proud of your daughter.

914
01:59:18,204 --> 01:59:19,939
Why? It's a school concert.

915
01:59:21,274 --> 01:59:23,276
She's standing in for a pupil.

916
01:59:23,476 --> 01:59:24,877
That pupil is my daughter.

917
01:59:25,878 --> 01:59:27,280
Where are you sitting?

918
01:59:31,951 --> 01:59:33,719
Not far from us.

919
01:59:34,320 --> 01:59:37,723
It's late. We'd better go.
Can we go up together?

920
01:59:37,890 --> 01:59:38,958
Are you coming, Anna?

921
01:59:40,026 --> 01:59:43,863
See you later. I'll go up
with Mrs. Schober. Break a leg.

922
01:59:44,196 --> 01:59:45,731
Enjoy the concert.

923
01:59:45,965 --> 01:59:48,034
Goodbye,
it was a pleasure to see you.

924
02:01:08,247 --> 02:01:09,181
There, now...

925
02:01:10,249 --> 02:01:11,651
What a nice surprise!

926
02:01:13,152 --> 02:01:15,254
George! Look who's here.

927
02:01:15,254 --> 02:01:16,289
- Professor Kohut.
- My respects.

928
02:01:16,455 --> 02:01:19,892
Hurry up, Gerda.
Give me your coat.

929
02:01:19,959 --> 02:01:21,527
I'll keep it with me.

930
02:01:21,661 --> 02:01:23,896
Men! Always rushing you.
You know how it is.

931
02:01:24,030 --> 02:01:26,165
Have an excellent evening.

932
02:01:26,699 --> 02:01:28,000
Come on!

933
02:01:28,200 --> 02:01:29,602
See you later, I hope.

934
02:01:29,835 --> 02:01:32,672
My respects, Professor.
I can't wait to hear you play.
