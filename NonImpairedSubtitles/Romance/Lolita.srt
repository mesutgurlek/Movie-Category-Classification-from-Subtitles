1
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:10,714
She was Lo. Plain Lo in the morning.

2
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:13,842
Standing four feet ten in one sock.

3
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:17,012
She was Lola in slacks.

4
00:02:17,221 --> 00:02:19,223
She was Dolly at school.

5
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:22,184
She was Dolores on the dotted line.

6
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:25,854
In my arms, she was always...

7
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:28,023
..Lolita.

8
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:31,735
Light ofmy life.

9
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:33,904
Fire ofmy loins.

10
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:35,656
My sin.

11
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,407
My soul.

12
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:39,576
Lolita.

13
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:46,667
But there might have been
no Lolita at all...

14
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:48,836
..had I not first metAnnabel.

15
00:02:56,635 --> 00:02:58,637
We were both 14.

16
00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:03,100
Whatever happens to a boy
during the summer he's 14...

17
00:03:03,267 --> 00:03:05,394
..can mark him for life.

18
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:18,866
That hotel you see, the Mirana,...

19
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,617
..that belonged to us.

20
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:44,725
She wanted to be a nurse.

21
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:50,272
I wanted to be a spy.

22
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:59,031
All at once we were madly,
hopelessly in love.

23
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:44,368
Four months later, she died oftyphus.

24
00:04:54,378 --> 00:04:57,172
The shock ofher death
froze something in me.

25
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:59,341
The child I loved was gone.

26
00:05:01,552 --> 00:05:03,554
But I kept looking for her...

27
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:07,516
..long after I'd left
my own childhood behind.

28
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:15,899
The poison was in the wound, you see.

29
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:18,068
And the wound wouldn't heal.

30
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:31,999
I probably should have
joined the priesthood.

31
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:36,587
Instead, I accepted a teaching post
at Beardsley College in America.

32
00:05:38,172 --> 00:05:40,841
I had a summer free
before the Fall semester.

33
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:43,886
I thought I'd finish
a textbook I was working on.

34
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:47,264
A survey ofFrench literature
for American students.

35
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:55,564
I took my advance...

36
00:05:55,731 --> 00:06:00,652
..and went to live at the house offriends
of my late uncle's, the McCoos,...

37
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:03,238
..in the New England town ofRamsdale.

38
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:09,119
But on arriving, I found
that it was no longer there.

39
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:15,626
But a friend ofMrs McCoo,...

40
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:17,878
..a widow, Mrs Charlotte Haze,...

41
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:19,838
..agreed to accommodate me.

42
00:06:29,348 --> 00:06:32,059
- Goddamn dog!

43
00:06:57,793 --> 00:07:00,003
One minute. Something's burnin'.

44
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:01,630
Lord have mercy!

45
00:07:01,797 --> 00:07:03,799
Mrs Haze'll be down in one.

46
00:07:05,843 --> 00:07:10,389
ls that Professor Humbert,
Louise? Tell him I'll be down in one.

47
00:07:10,556 --> 00:07:13,392
She'll be down in one!

48
00:07:20,691 --> 00:07:22,067
Monsieur Humbert.

49
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:25,153
Uh, yes.

50
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,322
Mrs Haze, is it?

51
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:30,492
Charlotte.

52
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:33,245
I am so pleased
to make your acquaintance.

53
00:07:33,412 --> 00:07:36,832
Frank McCoo told me all about
your scholarly pursuits.

54
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:42,045
I myself just cherish the French tongue.

55
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,382
Um... I wonder, could l...

56
00:07:45,549 --> 00:07:47,384
Mm. Come in.

57
00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:51,555
Harold and l, the late Mr Haze,...

58
00:07:51,722 --> 00:07:53,682
..we simply adored Mexico.

59
00:07:53,849 --> 00:07:57,102
The whole idea
of a culture that sophisticated.

60
00:07:57,269 --> 00:07:59,521
And we think of them as primitive.

61
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:01,690
I mean, look at us!

62
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:04,234
Indeed, yes.

63
00:08:04,902 --> 00:08:06,904
Upstairs.

64
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:09,156
I and Lo have our rooms just there.

65
00:08:10,574 --> 00:08:12,576
And this is your room.

66
00:08:12,743 --> 00:08:14,995
Space for a desk, anything you want.

67
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:19,666
And at $20 a month,
you can't beat the price.

68
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:23,921
And here's the bathroom.
It's a bit of a mess.

69
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:35,682
And this is the kitchen.

70
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:39,811
Now, if you have any special
food needs, you just say.

71
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:44,566
I don't know if Ramsdale can provide you
with foie grass, like you're used to.

72
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:46,235
What's that?

73
00:08:47,361 --> 00:08:49,821
Uh... timetable. For when I um...

74
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:54,451
I was hoping I wouldn't have to,
but I think I've got to go back to New York.

75
00:08:54,618 --> 00:08:59,623
- Oh, you're not too favourably impressed.
- No... There's a Baudelaire conference...

76
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:04,127
This is not a neat household,
but you would be very comfortable here.

77
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:06,129
Very comfortable indeed.

78
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:09,341
Don't say no until you've seen the piazza.

79
00:09:09,508 --> 00:09:11,510
Come.

80
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:14,888
Well, I call it the piazza.

81
00:09:16,807 --> 00:09:20,310
It's so much work
to keep it healthy and green.

82
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,522
It's a life's work.

83
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:27,150
That's my Lo.

84
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,702
And these are my lilies.

85
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:40,372
I love lilies.

86
00:09:40,539 --> 00:09:44,334
- Lily's a nice name, don't you think?
- Beautiful.

87
00:10:30,881 --> 00:10:32,883
Beautiful!

88
00:10:33,592 --> 00:10:35,511
How much did you say the room was?

89
00:11:31,984 --> 00:11:33,986
A normal man,...

90
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:37,114
..given a group photograph
of schoolgirls...

91
00:11:37,281 --> 00:11:41,076
..and asked to point out
the loveliest one,...

92
00:11:41,243 --> 00:11:44,830
..will not necessarily choose
the nymphet among them.

93
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:49,626
You have to be an artist,...

94
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:56,175
..a madman, full ofshame
and melancholy and despair,...

95
00:11:56,341 --> 00:12:00,554
..in order to recognise
the little deadly demon among the others.

96
00:12:03,015 --> 00:12:05,017
She stands...

97
00:12:06,518 --> 00:12:09,563
..unrecognised by them,...

98
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:13,400
..unconscious herself
of her fantastic power.

99
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:20,991
- See you later, alligator.
- After a while, crocodile!

100
00:12:21,158 --> 00:12:24,411
- Real soon, Daniel Boone.
- Get fucked, Daffy Duck.

101
00:12:47,017 --> 00:12:52,981
# Don't know why...
there's no sun up in the sky

102
00:12:53,148 --> 00:12:56,235
# Stormy weather

103
00:12:56,693 --> 00:13:01,073
# Since my man and I ain't together...

104
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,242
You woke me up.

105
00:13:04,243 --> 00:13:06,829
- Sorry.

106
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:12,292
I'll stop.

107
00:14:53,352 --> 00:14:56,230
Dolores!
Have you made your bed?

108
00:14:57,231 --> 00:14:59,024
No, I have not made my bed.

109
00:14:59,191 --> 00:15:01,985
I asked you to make your bed, didn't l?

110
00:15:02,152 --> 00:15:04,863
No. You asked me if I'd made my bed.

111
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:07,741
Make your bed.

112
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:10,911
- Now!

113
00:15:11,078 --> 00:15:13,163
I long for some terrific disaster.

114
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:15,290
Earthquake.

115
00:15:15,457 --> 00:15:17,459
Spectacular explosion.

116
00:15:17,626 --> 00:15:19,419
Make your bed!

117
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:22,548
Her mother instantly eliminated.

118
00:15:24,091 --> 00:15:26,885
Along with everybody else
for miles around.

119
00:15:30,013 --> 00:15:32,015
Lolita...

120
00:15:32,182 --> 00:15:34,184
..in my arms.

121
00:16:07,801 --> 00:16:09,803
I'm sleepy today.

122
00:16:10,762 --> 00:16:12,848
Me too.

123
00:16:14,391 --> 00:16:16,852
Have you been having trouble sleeping?

124
00:16:18,437 --> 00:16:20,689
You can't imagine.

125
00:16:55,766 --> 00:16:57,351
Am I getting a zit?

126
00:16:58,936 --> 00:17:00,938
What?

127
00:17:01,104 --> 00:17:03,106
Do you see a pimple on my chin?

128
00:17:09,404 --> 00:17:12,115
You look absolutely perfect to me.

129
00:17:13,575 --> 00:17:15,744
Wanna see my chin wobble?

130
00:17:17,037 --> 00:17:18,705
OK.

131
00:17:27,798 --> 00:17:29,800
Humbert!

132
00:17:40,394 --> 00:17:41,436
Humbert...

133
00:17:43,146 --> 00:17:45,357
Is she keeping you up?

134
00:17:47,109 --> 00:17:49,111
I beg your pardon?

135
00:17:49,486 --> 00:17:51,029
No!

136
00:17:51,196 --> 00:17:52,531
No. No, I'm...

137
00:17:53,782 --> 00:17:55,784
No.

138
00:17:58,328 --> 00:18:01,081
Well, it's probably just a 24-hour bug.

139
00:18:01,248 --> 00:18:03,667
He was looking forward to meeting you.

140
00:18:03,834 --> 00:18:06,086
Has anybody seen my other sneaker?!

141
00:18:20,017 --> 00:18:22,352
Your breakfast, Professor Humbert.

142
00:18:29,151 --> 00:18:32,029
Don't tell Mother, but I ate all your bacon.

143
00:18:40,496 --> 00:18:43,624
- Dolores, that was Mrs Farlow.
- So?

144
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:47,002
Rose has a temperature
and can't go to Hourglass Lake.

145
00:18:47,169 --> 00:18:49,463
- Oh, yeah?
- Do not use that tone with me!

146
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:51,507
Are you ready for church?

147
00:18:51,673 --> 00:18:54,259
I'm not going to that disgusting church.

148
00:18:54,426 --> 00:18:57,471
- Young lady...
- No picnic, no church.

149
00:18:57,638 --> 00:19:00,474
That is fine with me.
It is your conscience.

150
00:19:00,641 --> 00:19:03,644
I want your room spick-and-span
when I get home.

151
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:06,772
- And wash your hair, young lady.
- I did wash it!

152
00:19:06,939 --> 00:19:08,941
- When?
- A couple of months ago.

153
00:19:29,795 --> 00:19:31,797
I could be a dancer.

154
00:19:35,092 --> 00:19:37,094
That's a major option.

155
00:19:41,807 --> 00:19:43,809
Cos I do have a natural grace.

156
00:19:45,477 --> 00:19:49,314
- You know. A kind of sad beauty.
- Sort of sad is right.

157
00:19:52,192 --> 00:19:54,361
I'd like to see you dance sometime.

158
00:19:54,528 --> 00:19:58,031
Little girls always want to be
ballerinas, don't they?

159
00:19:58,198 --> 00:20:00,200
I know I did.

160
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:03,579
But I was - how should I put it? -
a tad too... plump?

161
00:20:03,745 --> 00:20:05,831
- Is that the right word?
- Yes.

162
00:20:09,168 --> 00:20:11,170
I'll get more Vouvray.

163
00:20:16,717 --> 00:20:19,803
Make her take us
to Hourglass Lake tomorrow.

164
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:22,264
- Me?
- Mm-hm.

165
00:20:22,431 --> 00:20:24,433
She'll do anything you say.

166
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,768
She's getting a thing about you.

167
00:20:37,321 --> 00:20:39,323
Whisper, whisper.

168
00:20:39,489 --> 00:20:41,867
What are you two so cosy about?

169
00:20:42,034 --> 00:20:44,703
Um... Did I ever tell you both that...

170
00:20:45,954 --> 00:20:47,915
..l was once a...

171
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:50,083
..that I was once a... um...

172
00:20:52,169 --> 00:20:55,714
Uh... that l...
I was once a cook in the North Pole?

173
00:20:55,881 --> 00:20:58,550
- A cook?
- Well, not exactly a cook.

174
00:20:58,675 --> 00:21:00,677
I opened a few cans.

175
00:21:02,596 --> 00:21:06,016
It was a weather expedition.
And I shot a polar bear.

176
00:21:06,183 --> 00:21:08,185
- No!
- Well, I didn't hit it.

177
00:21:08,352 --> 00:21:11,438
Why shoot a polar bear?
That's a lousy thing to do.

178
00:21:11,605 --> 00:21:14,191
Because I found it...

179
00:21:14,358 --> 00:21:17,903
..with its face - Iisten to this -
in the ice-cream mixer.

180
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:23,116
I couldn't let that pass
because we lived off ice cream.

181
00:21:26,787 --> 00:21:28,789
You're out of your gourd, Humpy.

182
00:21:30,415 --> 00:21:32,835
Will you stop fidgeting with the doll?

183
00:21:34,461 --> 00:21:37,172
And now we all think
that Lo should go to bed.

184
00:21:37,339 --> 00:21:39,341
Lo?

185
00:21:39,508 --> 00:21:41,510
What do you mean "we", paleface?

186
00:21:42,803 --> 00:21:46,974
So, as I was saying, there I was
with my white polar-bear gun...

187
00:21:49,017 --> 00:21:51,687
- ..to blend in.

188
00:21:51,854 --> 00:21:53,856
It's for me!

189
00:21:56,191 --> 00:21:57,150
Hello?

190
00:21:57,985 --> 00:22:02,990
- No, I'm sorry. She's busy.
- I hope you will forgive her bad manners.

191
00:22:03,156 --> 00:22:05,117
- Now what?!

192
00:22:05,284 --> 00:22:07,828
Look! It's my modern dance creation!

193
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:15,669
Dolores Haze, turn that music down!

194
00:22:18,297 --> 00:22:22,676
She is a pest. Just slap her hard
if she interferes with your meditations.

195
00:22:25,804 --> 00:22:27,222
Psst!

196
00:22:39,902 --> 00:22:41,653
Hum...

197
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:46,241
Hum, do you know that I have
one most ambitious dream?

198
00:22:46,408 --> 00:22:48,744
To get a hold of a real trained maid...

199
00:22:48,911 --> 00:22:52,247
..like that German girl
that the Talbots spoke of...

200
00:22:52,414 --> 00:22:54,416
..and have her live in the house.

201
00:22:54,583 --> 00:22:56,585
- No room.
- Oh, chéri, chéri.

202
00:22:56,752 --> 00:23:00,797
You underestimate the possibilities
of our humble household.

203
00:23:00,964 --> 00:23:03,050
We'd put her in Lo's room.

204
00:23:03,217 --> 00:23:06,762
I intended to turn that hole
into a guest room anyway.

205
00:23:06,929 --> 00:23:08,931
But where would Lo sleep?

206
00:23:09,097 --> 00:23:12,392
Little Lo does not enter the picture at all.

207
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:16,522
Little Lo goes straight from camp
to a good boarding school...

208
00:23:16,688 --> 00:23:20,651
..with strict discipline
and some sound religious training.

209
00:23:23,779 --> 00:23:25,739
I won't go!

210
00:23:25,906 --> 00:23:30,202
I want all of these name tags
sewn on your clothes by tomorrow.

211
00:23:31,745 --> 00:23:33,747
I don't want to go.

212
00:23:33,914 --> 00:23:35,541
I didn't ask your opinion!

213
00:23:35,707 --> 00:23:38,126
I don't want to go and you can't make me.

214
00:23:38,293 --> 00:23:41,463
Look, we all think it's a good idea.

215
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:46,426
Professor Humbert thinks it's a good idea,
I think it's a good idea, and you are going!

216
00:23:49,888 --> 00:23:51,473
Double-crosser!

217
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,851
Ow!

218
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:58,897
I asked you to put that suitcase
in the car an hour ago!

219
00:23:59,106 --> 00:24:02,442
Louise, thank you so much
for helping the poor child.

220
00:24:04,862 --> 00:24:09,783
Goddamn it! Dolores, I told you
to put this lunch basket in the back seat!

221
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:12,161
Why always tell me to do everything?

222
00:24:12,327 --> 00:24:14,538
I'm the one that won't be eating it.

223
00:24:14,705 --> 00:24:17,958
Louise! Brussels sprouts
and meat loaf for dinner.

224
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:21,211
- All right. Drive careful.
- Thank you. Let's go!

225
00:24:21,378 --> 00:24:23,380
- Bye, my baby.
- Bye, Louise.

226
00:24:23,547 --> 00:24:26,049
- You be good. I'm gonna miss you.
- Agh!

227
00:24:27,509 --> 00:24:29,511
Dolores!

228
00:24:29,678 --> 00:24:31,805
Let's go!

229
00:24:31,972 --> 00:24:33,765
Speed it up!

230
00:24:33,932 --> 00:24:35,684
Get in the car!

231
00:24:40,647 --> 00:24:43,400
Now what?! That child!

232
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:51,200
- Louise, maybe tenderloin.
- That'd be good.

233
00:25:39,289 --> 00:25:41,291
I'm waiting!

234
00:25:42,125 --> 00:25:45,504
If I've told you once,
I've told you a thousand times...

235
00:25:45,671 --> 00:25:48,090
..not to make me wait in the car.

236
00:25:49,299 --> 00:25:52,553
If you weren't going to camp,
I would ground you.

237
00:26:16,618 --> 00:26:18,620
Mr Humble!

238
00:26:18,787 --> 00:26:21,665
These damn stairs
are gonna be the death of me.

239
00:26:21,832 --> 00:26:23,584
Mr Humble!

240
00:26:24,877 --> 00:26:26,461
Mr Humble!

241
00:26:26,628 --> 00:26:28,630
Mr Humble?

242
00:26:32,676 --> 00:26:34,678
I have something for you.

243
00:26:34,845 --> 00:26:37,014
Oh, yes.

244
00:26:37,181 --> 00:26:40,517
I'm leaving, but I'll be back later.

245
00:26:43,812 --> 00:26:46,398
What the hell he doin' in there?

246
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:52,321
This is a confession.

247
00:26:52,487 --> 00:26:54,490
I love you.

248
00:26:54,656 --> 00:26:56,992
I'm a passionate and lonely woman...

249
00:26:57,159 --> 00:26:59,161
..and you are the love ofmy life.

250
00:26:59,328 --> 00:27:01,330
Now you know.

251
00:27:01,497 --> 00:27:03,916
So please, destroy this letter and go.

252
00:27:04,833 --> 00:27:08,420
I shall return by dinner time
and you must be gone by then.

253
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:12,674
You see, chéri, ifl found you at home,...

254
00:27:12,841 --> 00:27:16,345
..the fact ofyour remaining
would mean only one thing.

255
00:27:16,512 --> 00:27:20,682
That you want me as much as I do you,
as a lifelong mate,...

256
00:27:20,849 --> 00:27:25,771
..and that you are ready to link up
your life with mine for ever and ever...

257
00:27:25,938 --> 00:27:28,774
..and be a father to my little girl.

258
00:27:30,984 --> 00:27:35,656
Two weeks later,
we were married in a simple ceremony.

259
00:27:35,823 --> 00:27:39,993
Big Haze made sure little Haze
was not in attendance.

260
00:27:45,541 --> 00:27:47,543
Mm. This is bliss.

261
00:27:47,709 --> 00:27:50,128
This is heaven on earth. Isn't it, Hump?

262
00:27:50,295 --> 00:27:52,297
Mm.

263
00:27:55,592 --> 00:27:58,095
Are you working on your book?

264
00:27:58,262 --> 00:28:00,264
Yes.

265
00:28:08,272 --> 00:28:10,607
Oh, a secret drawer. What's in there?

266
00:28:12,442 --> 00:28:14,444
Locked-up love letters.

267
00:28:15,946 --> 00:28:17,948
Where's the key?

268
00:28:18,907 --> 00:28:21,201
Hidden.

269
00:28:21,368 --> 00:28:24,538
"I'm in the Mood for Love")

270
00:28:27,958 --> 00:28:31,086
During the six weeks
we'd been married,...

271
00:28:31,253 --> 00:28:34,756
..l successfully avoided
most ofmy husbandly duties.

272
00:28:38,218 --> 00:28:42,848
Throughout July, I'd been offering
Charlotte various sleeping tablets,...

273
00:28:43,015 --> 00:28:45,184
..which she gobbled down happily.

274
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:47,352
She was a great taker ofpills.

275
00:28:49,855 --> 00:28:53,734
# I'm in the mood for love

276
00:28:54,651 --> 00:28:58,280
# Simply because you're near me

277
00:28:59,072 --> 00:29:02,701
# Funny, but when you're near me

278
00:29:03,368 --> 00:29:06,997
# I'm in the mood for love

279
00:29:08,165 --> 00:29:11,752
# Heaven is in your eyes

280
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:15,506
# Bright as the stars we're under

281
00:29:16,632 --> 00:29:20,135
# Oh, is it any wonder...

282
00:29:20,302 --> 00:29:24,014
The last dose I had tried
had knocked her out for four hours.

283
00:29:24,181 --> 00:29:28,227
But that was not enough
to guarantee me an undisturbed night.

284
00:29:31,188 --> 00:29:33,190
Hum...

285
00:29:34,024 --> 00:29:36,026
At last!

286
00:29:38,111 --> 00:29:39,488
Mm.

287
00:29:41,615 --> 00:29:43,617
I think I must be immune.

288
00:29:46,745 --> 00:29:49,832
Wh... What would you give me
if you wanted to uh...

289
00:29:49,998 --> 00:29:51,750
..to knock out...

290
00:29:51,917 --> 00:29:53,627
..say, a cow?

291
00:29:55,254 --> 00:29:58,382
J-Just for... seven or eight hours.

292
00:29:58,549 --> 00:30:00,133
So that...

293
00:30:01,969 --> 00:30:05,305
..you know, the cow... would stay asleep?

294
00:30:07,808 --> 00:30:11,311
Even if you were
tossing and turning next to it.

295
00:30:12,354 --> 00:30:13,981
Well...

296
00:30:14,147 --> 00:30:15,524
Why don't you...

297
00:30:15,691 --> 00:30:17,276
..try these?

298
00:30:17,442 --> 00:30:19,027
They're new.

299
00:30:20,571 --> 00:30:23,031
My wife takes them and...

300
00:30:23,198 --> 00:30:26,702
..l don't hear a peep out of her
all night long.

301
00:30:28,036 --> 00:30:30,038
Sounds like just the thing.

302
00:30:42,134 --> 00:30:44,136
I'm home!

303
00:30:46,847 --> 00:30:48,432
Hello?

304
00:30:53,645 --> 00:30:55,230
Hello?

305
00:30:56,565 --> 00:30:58,150
Hello?

306
00:31:08,368 --> 00:31:10,370
"The Haze woman."

307
00:31:11,955 --> 00:31:13,957
"The fat cow"?

308
00:31:16,376 --> 00:31:18,378
"The obnoxious mamma"?

309
00:31:21,965 --> 00:31:26,678
Well, the "old stupid Haze woman"
is no longer your dupe.

310
00:31:26,845 --> 00:31:29,223
Charlotte!

311
00:31:31,433 --> 00:31:33,894
You're a monster.

312
00:31:34,061 --> 00:31:37,523
- You're a despicable, criminal monster.

313
00:31:37,689 --> 00:31:40,359
- Now...
- If you come near me I'll scream!

314
00:31:40,526 --> 00:31:42,611
- Let me just...
- Get away from me!

315
00:31:42,778 --> 00:31:44,905
I'm leaving tonight.

316
00:31:45,072 --> 00:31:47,407
You can keep this house. I don't care.

317
00:31:48,867 --> 00:31:53,997
But you will never see
that miserable brat ever again.

318
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:59,503
Now get out of my sight!

319
00:32:17,354 --> 00:32:19,356
Charlotte, you mustn't...

320
00:32:19,523 --> 00:32:21,525
You mustn't ruin our lives.

321
00:32:23,944 --> 00:32:25,946
That's...

322
00:32:26,113 --> 00:32:30,534
That's just... That's just a fragment of...

323
00:32:30,701 --> 00:32:32,828
..a novel I'm writing.

324
00:32:34,746 --> 00:32:37,082
I used your name on those...

325
00:32:37,249 --> 00:32:39,501
..just for... convenience.

326
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,922
I'll get us a drink.

327
00:33:00,147 --> 00:33:03,358
A nice stiff drink
will clear both our heads.

328
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:11,283
Charlotte, I made us a nice stiff drink!

329
00:33:13,535 --> 00:33:15,537
Yes?

330
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:19,041
But that's ridiculous.

331
00:33:19,958 --> 00:33:24,796
There's this man on the phone
saying you've been killed, Charlotte.

332
00:33:25,672 --> 00:33:27,049
Charlotte?

333
00:34:08,048 --> 00:34:10,384
I'm... I'm sorry.

334
00:34:15,764 --> 00:34:17,850
Stand back, please.

335
00:34:18,892 --> 00:34:21,019
Where's my wife?

336
00:34:21,854 --> 00:34:25,274
- Are you Mr Humbert?
- I am.

337
00:34:27,317 --> 00:34:29,319
She ran right in front of me.

338
00:34:29,486 --> 00:34:31,655
I... I didn't even see her.

339
00:34:35,868 --> 00:34:37,703
Sir?

340
00:34:42,082 --> 00:34:44,084
I'm sorry, sir.

341
00:34:44,251 --> 00:34:46,211
Is this Mrs Humbert?

342
00:34:49,631 --> 00:34:51,175
Sir,...

343
00:34:51,341 --> 00:34:53,385
..is this Mrs Humbert?

344
00:34:56,471 --> 00:34:58,432
Oh, God...

345
00:34:59,641 --> 00:35:02,895
Oh, God... Oh, God!

346
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,618
She was walking to the mailbox.

347
00:35:18,827 --> 00:35:21,079
She was going to mail these letters.

348
00:35:22,831 --> 00:35:24,416
I'm sorry.

349
00:35:25,542 --> 00:35:27,586
Thank you.

350
00:35:31,256 --> 00:35:33,675
I'll go and... Iie down, officer.

351
00:35:33,884 --> 00:35:36,970
- Will that be all right?
- You go right ahead, sir.

352
00:35:37,137 --> 00:35:40,098
I'll just be across in the house if you...

353
00:37:10,022 --> 00:37:12,357
Is that the Enchanted Hunters Hotel?

354
00:37:12,524 --> 00:37:14,526
Yes. This is Mr Humbert.

355
00:37:14,693 --> 00:37:16,653
Tomorrow night.

356
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:18,822
Just the one night, please.

357
00:37:20,699 --> 00:37:22,701
Yes, a room with twin beds.

358
00:37:22,868 --> 00:37:26,413
For two.
Well, one and a half people, really.

359
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:28,457
It's just for me and my...

360
00:37:28,624 --> 00:37:32,377
..my short... my small daughter.

361
00:38:10,582 --> 00:38:12,501
She should be here any minute.

362
00:38:13,001 --> 00:38:15,754
I sent Charlie for her over at the barn.

363
00:38:17,798 --> 00:38:20,259
- Who's Charlie?
- Come on, come on.

364
00:38:22,302 --> 00:38:26,098
It's such a pleasure to watch
our young people make friends.

365
00:38:26,265 --> 00:38:28,976
- So uh... who is this Charlie?
- Here she is.

366
00:38:42,614 --> 00:38:44,449
Hi, Dad!

367
00:38:44,616 --> 00:38:47,953
# Hum and Mum, Mum and Hum

368
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:52,124
# Hum and Mum, Mum and Hum

369
00:38:52,291 --> 00:38:54,710
# Hum and Mum, Mum and Hum...

370
00:38:54,877 --> 00:38:58,547
- How's Mum?
- Well... The doctors aren't quite sure.

371
00:38:58,714 --> 00:39:00,966
It's something abdominal.

372
00:39:03,302 --> 00:39:04,803
Abominable?

373
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:06,972
Abdominal.

374
00:39:12,769 --> 00:39:16,273
She's in a special hospital
over in Lepingville.

375
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:19,109
So... I thought we'd... we'd...

376
00:39:19,276 --> 00:39:21,653
..go over to Briceland,...

377
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:25,574
..spend the night there and...
visit the hospital tomorrow.

378
00:39:25,741 --> 00:39:27,576
Or the next day.

379
00:39:32,831 --> 00:39:35,000
So, did you have a good time at camp?

380
00:39:35,167 --> 00:39:36,960
Mm-hm.

381
00:39:38,295 --> 00:39:40,297
You know, I missed you.

382
00:39:40,464 --> 00:39:42,466
I missed you a lot.

383
00:39:42,633 --> 00:39:45,219
Well, I didn't miss you.

384
00:39:45,385 --> 00:39:48,555
In fact, I've been
revoltingly unfaithful to you.

385
00:39:48,722 --> 00:39:52,226
But so what? Cos you don't care
about me any more anyway.

386
00:39:52,392 --> 00:39:55,395
Why do you think I don't care about you?

387
00:39:55,562 --> 00:39:58,607
Well, you haven't
kissed me yet, have you?

388
00:40:26,969 --> 00:40:28,428
Oh!

389
00:40:29,638 --> 00:40:33,183
- Uh, I'm sorry, officer.
- See a blue sedan, same make as yours?

390
00:40:33,350 --> 00:40:38,313
- They might have passed you at the turn.
- Blue sedan? No, I don't think... agh!

391
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:42,317
- We didn't see a blue sedan.
- No, I don't think we did.

392
00:40:42,484 --> 00:40:45,904
Are you sure it was blue?
I saw one that was more purple.

393
00:40:46,071 --> 00:40:48,198
Or maybe it was more red.

394
00:40:48,365 --> 00:40:50,450
All right, OK. Thank you.

395
00:40:51,326 --> 00:40:54,079
- Thank you!

396
00:40:54,246 --> 00:40:56,582
Don't shoot, don't shoot!

397
00:41:12,306 --> 00:41:14,308
Wow! Looks swank!

398
00:41:24,151 --> 00:41:26,695
# No, I will never tell lies

399
00:41:26,862 --> 00:41:29,823
# But still I'm called Buttercup...

400
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:33,869
Good evening. I have a reservation
in the name of Humbert.

401
00:41:34,036 --> 00:41:36,038
Twin-bedded room.

402
00:41:36,205 --> 00:41:38,874
I called last night.

403
00:41:39,041 --> 00:41:41,710
- Two people.
- Oh!

404
00:41:41,835 --> 00:41:43,629
I'm sorry, Mr Humbug.

405
00:41:43,795 --> 00:41:49,134
I held the room with the twin beds for you
till 6.30, but I didn't hear from you.

406
00:41:49,259 --> 00:41:54,765
We hold till 6.30. And with the flower
show and Glory of Christ convention...

407
00:41:54,932 --> 00:41:57,184
My name is not Humbug. It's Herbert.

408
00:41:57,768 --> 00:41:59,269
Humbert.

409
00:42:00,646 --> 00:42:04,900
Just put us in any room. Put a cot in
for my daughter. She's very tired.

410
00:42:07,319 --> 00:42:10,739
Perhaps I could put you in room 342.
It has a double bed.

411
00:42:10,906 --> 00:42:14,368
I expect we'll manage.
My wife may be turning up later.

412
00:42:18,247 --> 00:42:20,249
Please sign here, mister.

413
00:42:26,588 --> 00:42:28,757
It's a nice dog, huh?

414
00:42:28,924 --> 00:42:30,926
I love dogs.

415
00:42:32,970 --> 00:42:34,972
Well, that's my dog.

416
00:42:35,138 --> 00:42:36,849
He likes you.

417
00:42:37,015 --> 00:42:39,560
Doesn't like everybody.

418
00:42:41,812 --> 00:42:43,814
Who does he like?

419
00:42:44,982 --> 00:42:47,151
He can smell when people are sweet.

420
00:42:48,193 --> 00:42:50,070
He likes sweet people.

421
00:42:50,237 --> 00:42:52,739
Nice young people.

422
00:42:52,906 --> 00:42:54,908
Like you.

423
00:43:03,834 --> 00:43:05,836
Here we are.

424
00:43:26,064 --> 00:43:28,066
Thanks very much.

425
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:33,197
Wait a sec. You mean
we're sleeping in one room?

426
00:43:35,073 --> 00:43:37,201
With one bed?

427
00:43:37,367 --> 00:43:39,703
I've asked them to send up a cot,...

428
00:43:39,870 --> 00:43:41,872
..which I'll use, if you like.

429
00:43:46,168 --> 00:43:47,920
You're crazy.

430
00:43:48,086 --> 00:43:50,631
Why, my darling?

431
00:43:50,797 --> 00:43:52,799
Because, my darling,...

432
00:43:52,966 --> 00:43:57,513
..when my darling mother finds out,
she'll divorce you and strangle me.

433
00:43:57,679 --> 00:43:59,181
Lo,...

434
00:43:59,348 --> 00:44:01,350
..listen to me a moment.

435
00:44:01,517 --> 00:44:04,478
For all practical purposes,
I am your father,...

436
00:44:04,645 --> 00:44:07,064
..and I'm responsible for your welfare.

437
00:44:07,231 --> 00:44:09,775
Now, we're not rich.

438
00:44:09,942 --> 00:44:14,571
So when we travel, we-we're sure to be...
I mean, we'll be thrown together.

439
00:44:16,949 --> 00:44:18,200
Sometimes.

440
00:44:18,367 --> 00:44:21,328
Two people sharing
the same hotel room...

441
00:44:21,495 --> 00:44:24,414
..are bound to... enter into a...

442
00:44:24,581 --> 00:44:26,750
How can I put it? lnto a kind of um...

443
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,002
The word is "incest".

444
00:44:44,226 --> 00:44:46,895
I feel like we're grown-ups.

445
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:49,022
Me too.

446
00:44:49,189 --> 00:44:51,567
We get to do whatever we want, right?

447
00:44:51,733 --> 00:44:53,694
Whatever we want.

448
00:44:53,861 --> 00:44:55,445
Well, now.

449
00:44:55,612 --> 00:44:57,406
Who had the pie?

450
00:44:58,907 --> 00:45:00,450
Me.

451
00:45:04,288 --> 00:45:07,666
Whaddaya think? Are they me?

452
00:45:13,046 --> 00:45:15,048
- Don't look now.
- Why?

453
00:45:15,215 --> 00:45:17,217
The guy over in the corner.

454
00:45:18,051 --> 00:45:20,470
Don't look! He was staring at us.

455
00:45:20,637 --> 00:45:24,016
Don't you think that guy
looks exactly like Quilty?

456
00:45:24,183 --> 00:45:26,643
What, the dentist?

457
00:45:26,810 --> 00:45:29,396
Of course not. His brother.

458
00:45:29,563 --> 00:45:32,649
The writer Quilty.
You know, he writes the plays.

459
00:45:32,816 --> 00:45:36,069
The smoking guy.
He smokes the Dromes in the ad.

460
00:45:36,236 --> 00:45:38,405
We saw him in the lobby with his dog.

461
00:45:53,879 --> 00:45:56,423
If I tell you how naughty I was at camp,...

462
00:45:58,217 --> 00:46:00,219
..you promise you won't be mad?

463
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:03,222
Tell me later.

464
00:46:07,017 --> 00:46:09,019
I want you to go to bed.

465
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:12,815
I'll go downstairs while you...

466
00:46:14,149 --> 00:46:16,693
When I come up, I want you to be asleep.

467
00:46:17,569 --> 00:46:19,071
All right?

468
00:46:30,791 --> 00:46:32,876
I've been such a disgusting girl.

469
00:46:34,044 --> 00:46:36,046
Just let me tell you.

470
00:46:36,213 --> 00:46:38,215
Tell me tomorrow.

471
00:46:39,424 --> 00:46:41,426
I'm going to go now. All right?

472
00:46:43,053 --> 00:46:45,055
Good night, Dad.

473
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:58,902
Night-night.

474
00:47:09,705 --> 00:47:11,707
Gentlewomen ofthejury,...

475
00:47:13,458 --> 00:47:16,336
..if my happiness could have talked,...

476
00:47:16,503 --> 00:47:20,507
..it would have filled that hotel
with a deafening roar.

477
00:47:21,383 --> 00:47:23,385
My only regret...

478
00:47:23,552 --> 00:47:27,806
..is that I did not immediately deposit
key number 342 at the office...

479
00:47:27,973 --> 00:47:32,603
..and leave the town, the country,
the planet, that very night.

480
00:47:32,769 --> 00:47:38,859
The Lord knows all,
the Lord sees all, the Lord forgives all.

481
00:47:59,671 --> 00:48:02,090
Where the devil did you get her?

482
00:48:09,348 --> 00:48:13,018
- I beg your pardon?
- I said the weather's getting better.

483
00:48:19,274 --> 00:48:21,276
It seems so.

484
00:48:21,443 --> 00:48:23,445
Who's the lassie?

485
00:48:27,366 --> 00:48:29,368
Um...

486
00:48:31,245 --> 00:48:33,247
It's my daughter.

487
00:48:33,413 --> 00:48:36,208
You lie. She's not.

488
00:48:37,626 --> 00:48:38,585
What?

489
00:48:40,003 --> 00:48:42,005
I said July was hot.

490
00:48:44,508 --> 00:48:47,010
Where's her mother?

491
00:48:48,136 --> 00:48:50,138
Dead.

492
00:48:50,305 --> 00:48:52,266
Oh. Sorry.

493
00:48:52,432 --> 00:48:54,977
Why don't you two
lunch with me tomorrow?

494
00:48:55,143 --> 00:48:58,230
That clerical crowd will be gone soon.

495
00:48:58,897 --> 00:49:00,899
Um...

496
00:49:01,358 --> 00:49:03,360
We'll be gone too, thanks.

497
00:49:03,527 --> 00:49:05,028
Good night.

498
00:49:05,195 --> 00:49:08,240
Sorry. I'm very drunk. Good night.

499
00:49:12,077 --> 00:49:15,247
That child of yours needs a lot of sleep.

500
00:49:15,414 --> 00:49:18,125
"Sleep is a rose" the Persians say.

501
00:49:20,627 --> 00:49:22,629
Smoke?

502
00:49:22,796 --> 00:49:25,007
Not just now, thanks.

503
00:49:30,679 --> 00:49:33,140
Good night.

504
00:49:33,974 --> 00:49:35,976
Enjoy.

505
00:51:35,971 --> 00:51:39,683
Get back in the boat with Charlie.
You don't have to do that.

506
00:51:42,811 --> 00:51:45,022
Back in the boat.

507
00:52:02,956 --> 00:52:04,958
I'm thirsty.

508
00:52:10,464 --> 00:52:12,466
I'll bring you something.

509
00:54:48,539 --> 00:54:51,750
You... You played that with Charlie?
At camp?

510
00:54:51,917 --> 00:54:56,046
Don't tell me you never tried it
when you were a kid.

511
00:54:58,298 --> 00:55:00,509
Never.

512
00:55:02,803 --> 00:55:05,681
I guess I'm gonna have to
show you everything.

513
00:55:30,289 --> 00:55:32,291
Gentlewomen ofthejury,...

514
00:55:32,457 --> 00:55:34,459
..l was not even her first lover.

515
00:55:47,764 --> 00:55:49,766
What are you reading?

516
00:55:49,933 --> 00:55:51,810
Nothing.

517
00:55:54,146 --> 00:55:56,273
What's the matter?

518
00:55:58,400 --> 00:55:59,985
Nothing.

519
00:56:01,987 --> 00:56:03,989
Lo...

520
00:56:06,241 --> 00:56:09,703
You know that friend of yours
- Charlie - at camp?

521
00:56:11,246 --> 00:56:13,248
Was he the first one?

522
00:56:13,415 --> 00:56:15,959
Can we please get off the subject?

523
00:56:24,510 --> 00:56:26,762
I felt more and more uncomfortable.

524
00:56:28,722 --> 00:56:31,683
It was something quite special,
that feeling.

525
00:56:32,059 --> 00:56:34,603
An oppressive, hideous constraint,...

526
00:56:34,770 --> 00:56:39,358
..as ifl were sitting with the small ghost
of somebody I hadjust killed.

527
00:56:42,694 --> 00:56:44,071
Jesus!

528
00:56:44,238 --> 00:56:45,739
What?

529
00:56:45,906 --> 00:56:48,158
Can we stop at a gas station?

530
00:56:48,325 --> 00:56:50,744
We can go anywhere you like.

531
00:56:50,911 --> 00:56:52,913
Well, I need a gas station.

532
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:54,873
I hurt inside.

533
00:56:57,960 --> 00:57:00,045
Well, what do you expect?

534
00:57:00,212 --> 00:57:03,841
I was a daisy-fresh girl,
and look what you've done to me.

535
00:57:04,007 --> 00:57:08,804
I should call the police and tell them
that you raped me, you dirty old man.

536
00:57:31,410 --> 00:57:34,705
- Just wash the windscreen, would you?
- Yes, sir.

537
00:58:08,489 --> 00:58:10,073
Got some cookies.

538
00:58:12,117 --> 00:58:15,329
I want to call Mother in hospital.
What's the number?

539
00:58:16,955 --> 00:58:19,166
Get in. You can't call the hospital.

540
00:58:19,333 --> 00:58:21,126
Why not?

541
00:58:22,336 --> 00:58:24,087
Just get in the car.

542
00:58:27,883 --> 00:58:29,384
Slam the door.

543
00:58:32,262 --> 00:58:34,973
Why can't I call my own mother
if I want to?

544
00:58:37,726 --> 00:58:39,728
Because your mother's dead.

545
00:59:36,535 --> 00:59:38,537
Shh... Shh...

546
00:59:49,381 --> 00:59:52,301
We made up very gently that night.

547
00:59:52,467 --> 00:59:55,512
You see, she had nowhere else to go.

548
01:00:02,561 --> 01:00:05,772
It was then that we began
our extensive travels...

549
01:00:05,939 --> 01:00:07,941
..all over the United States.

550
01:00:08,108 --> 01:00:12,613
# Now the native population
and civilisation is fine

551
01:00:15,199 --> 01:00:19,703
# That civilisation
is the thing for me to see

552
01:00:21,788 --> 01:00:24,625
# Whoa, bongo, bongo, bongo

553
01:00:24,791 --> 01:00:27,794
# I don't wanna leave the Congo,
no, no, no, no, no, no

554
01:00:30,589 --> 01:00:35,385
- When's the best time to buy a bird?
- I don't know. When's the best time?

555
01:00:35,552 --> 01:00:37,513
When it's going "cheep!"

556
01:00:37,679 --> 01:00:39,932
Don't say I never gave you anything.

557
01:00:41,767 --> 01:00:43,644
Ow! Don't! I'm trying to drive!

558
01:00:47,356 --> 01:00:49,107
Don't do that! Oh, no!

559
01:00:50,776 --> 01:00:52,861
If it goes out the window, I won't stop.

560
01:00:53,028 --> 01:00:55,948
Don't! What are these? Hair grips?

561
01:01:06,166 --> 01:01:07,876
# Civilisation

562
01:01:08,043 --> 01:01:09,461
# No, no, no, no

563
01:01:09,628 --> 01:01:11,630
# I'll stay right here

564
01:01:20,097 --> 01:01:22,099
Look! They have Magic Fingers.

565
01:01:23,517 --> 01:01:25,269
Good.

566
01:01:25,435 --> 01:01:27,437
I need to shower.

567
01:01:28,856 --> 01:01:30,858
Give me a quarter and a dime.

568
01:01:31,024 --> 01:01:32,526
What for?

569
01:01:32,693 --> 01:01:34,945
For the Magic Fingers.

570
01:01:36,029 --> 01:01:38,240
My magic fingers aren't enough?

571
01:02:05,642 --> 01:02:12,316
# Amor-r-r, amor-r-r, amor-r-r-r-r

572
01:02:12,483 --> 01:02:17,488
# This w-word s-so s-sweet that I r-repeat

573
01:02:17,654 --> 01:02:21,408
# Means I adore you-u-u-u-u

574
01:02:21,575 --> 01:02:28,290
# Amor-r-r-r-r, amor-r-r-r-r, amor-r-r-r-r...

575
01:02:30,834 --> 01:02:32,836
Good shower for once, Lo!

576
01:02:33,003 --> 01:02:35,380
First-rate temperature control!

577
01:02:54,525 --> 01:02:56,068
Ow! Argh!

578
01:02:56,235 --> 01:02:59,363
- Agh! Lo!
- Hmm?

579
01:02:59,530 --> 01:03:02,741
My God, Lo! Don't flush when I'm in here!

580
01:03:27,516 --> 01:03:29,518
What is that?

581
01:03:30,686 --> 01:03:32,688
What's what?

582
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:39,319
That thing in your mouth.

583
01:03:39,486 --> 01:03:41,488
It's a jawbreaker.

584
01:03:42,614 --> 01:03:46,076
It's supposed to break your jaw.
Want one?

585
01:03:46,243 --> 01:03:49,705
Just give it to me.
I've had it with that noise.

586
01:03:54,168 --> 01:03:57,588
- Come on, spit it out. I've got a headache.
- It's good!

587
01:03:57,754 --> 01:04:01,341
Look, just give it to me, will you?
Spit it out.

588
01:04:32,206 --> 01:04:35,626
You look a hundred per cent better
when I can't see you.

589
01:04:35,792 --> 01:04:38,587
We took a circuitous route -
to put it mildly.

590
01:04:38,754 --> 01:04:42,049
In the back ofmy mind
was our eventual destination.

591
01:04:42,216 --> 01:04:47,763
Beardsley College, where I would finally
take up my teaching position.

592
01:04:47,930 --> 01:04:52,893
But in the front ofmy mind was
the need to keep going, keep driving.

593
01:04:54,728 --> 01:04:58,190
Lo, that's the last time
I let you drive this car.

594
01:04:58,357 --> 01:04:59,608
Serve into this square.

595
01:05:01,443 --> 01:05:02,945
And, despite our tiffs,...

596
01:05:04,321 --> 01:05:07,491
In the square, Lo.
Try and get it in the square.

597
01:05:07,658 --> 01:05:12,120
..despite the fuss she made, and
the danger and hopelessness ofit all,...

598
01:05:12,287 --> 01:05:13,747
Aim for my head.

599
01:05:13,914 --> 01:05:16,834
..despite all that, I was in paradise.

600
01:05:19,795 --> 01:05:23,799
A paradise whose skies
were the colour ofhell flames,...

601
01:05:26,093 --> 01:05:28,095
..but a paradise still.

602
01:09:19,535 --> 01:09:23,121
I know you have accepted a post
at Beardsley College,...

603
01:09:23,288 --> 01:09:27,793
..and I know that there,
academics are first, last and always.

604
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:31,380
Well, that's not us, Mr Himmler.

605
01:09:31,547 --> 01:09:34,299
Uh... Here at Beardsley Prep,...

606
01:09:34,466 --> 01:09:36,552
..what we stress are the three Ds.

607
01:09:36,718 --> 01:09:40,013
Dramatics, dancing and dating.

608
01:09:40,180 --> 01:09:45,060
Now, I know that the Reverend Rigger is
behind us on this. Aren't you, Reverend?

609
01:09:45,227 --> 01:09:48,981
- All the way, Miss Pratt. Every inch.
- So you see, Mr Humper,...

610
01:09:49,148 --> 01:09:54,236
..for the modern preadolescent, medieval
dates are less vital than weekend ones.

611
01:09:56,071 --> 01:09:59,158
- What? Weekend what?
- Dates, Mr Humping.

612
01:09:59,324 --> 01:10:01,994
Uh... boys.

613
01:10:11,712 --> 01:10:13,714
# By myselfalone at home

614
01:10:13,881 --> 01:10:15,465
# Feelin' blue

615
01:10:15,632 --> 01:10:19,595
I was not quite prepared
for the reality ofmy dual role.

616
01:10:19,761 --> 01:10:23,348
On the one hand,
the willing corrupter ofan innocent,...

617
01:10:23,515 --> 01:10:26,477
..and on the other,
Humbert the happy housewife.

618
01:10:28,687 --> 01:10:30,689
Where's the river Rhine?

619
01:10:32,566 --> 01:10:34,568
I don't know.

620
01:10:34,735 --> 01:10:36,737
You should know that.

621
01:10:36,904 --> 01:10:39,865
- Why?
- Big battles there in the Great War.

622
01:10:43,035 --> 01:10:45,037
Where's the river Seine?

623
01:10:46,705 --> 01:10:48,707
I don't know.

624
01:10:48,874 --> 01:10:52,336
I thought you were supposed
to have learnt these.

625
01:10:52,503 --> 01:10:54,505
It's not what I'm on.

626
01:10:55,380 --> 01:10:58,634
It seems to be pretty relaxed,
this school of yours.

627
01:11:01,553 --> 01:11:04,264
# When I was a kid about halfpast three

628
01:11:04,431 --> 01:11:06,850
# My ma said
"Daughter, come here to me"

629
01:11:07,017 --> 01:11:09,978
# Says "Things may come
and things may go"

630
01:11:10,145 --> 01:11:12,648
# "But this is one thing
you ought to know"

631
01:11:12,815 --> 01:11:15,943
# "Oh, t'ain't what you do,
it's the way that you do it"

632
01:11:16,109 --> 01:11:18,654
# "T'ain't what you do,
it's the way that you do it"

633
01:11:18,821 --> 01:11:21,657
# "T'ain't what you do,
it's the way that you do it"

634
01:11:21,824 --> 01:11:22,783
# "That's what...

635
01:11:49,434 --> 01:11:51,436
I'm supposed to be in a play.

636
01:11:52,688 --> 01:11:55,107
- What play?
- I don't know.

637
01:11:55,315 --> 01:11:57,317
Some play.

638
01:11:59,111 --> 01:12:01,113
At school.

639
01:12:05,367 --> 01:12:07,786
With the boys from Butler's Academy?

640
01:12:10,247 --> 01:12:12,666
I don't know.

641
01:12:12,833 --> 01:12:14,835
Maybe.

642
01:12:16,545 --> 01:12:18,547
I don't think it's a good idea.

643
01:12:20,132 --> 01:12:22,551
You're depriving me of my civil rights.

644
01:12:22,718 --> 01:12:25,304
Where did you learn that language?

645
01:12:28,682 --> 01:12:30,684
I'm intelligent.

646
01:13:05,677 --> 01:13:08,347
I have a right to be in a play if I want.

647
01:13:10,015 --> 01:13:12,017
Not if I say you don't.

648
01:13:27,574 --> 01:13:29,576
D'you like that?

649
01:13:34,915 --> 01:13:36,917
You want more, don't you?

650
01:13:55,185 --> 01:13:57,187
I want things, too.

651
01:13:59,148 --> 01:14:01,150
What?

652
01:14:02,860 --> 01:14:04,653
Things.

653
01:14:06,446 --> 01:14:09,158
You know how my allowance
is a dollar a week?

654
01:14:10,826 --> 01:14:12,828
Yes, I know.

655
01:14:12,995 --> 01:14:15,414
Well, I think it should be two dollars.

656
01:14:24,590 --> 01:14:27,259
I said, I think it should be two dollars.

657
01:14:31,597 --> 01:14:33,515
A dollar fifty.

658
01:14:43,442 --> 01:14:46,153
I really do think it should be two dollars.

659
01:14:49,948 --> 01:14:51,158
Am I right?

660
01:14:52,534 --> 01:14:54,411
Am I right?

661
01:14:56,872 --> 01:14:58,665
God, yes.

662
01:14:58,832 --> 01:15:00,626
Two dollars.

663
01:15:01,710 --> 01:15:04,087
And I get to be in the play.

664
01:15:08,634 --> 01:15:11,678
Oh, rosy mistress of the night.

665
01:15:11,845 --> 01:15:14,348
You have enchanted
many a hunter's heart.

666
01:15:14,515 --> 01:15:17,601
But this time, my temptress,...

667
01:15:17,768 --> 01:15:19,645
..you have met your match.

668
01:15:19,812 --> 01:15:22,689
For far more than a hunter,...

669
01:15:22,856 --> 01:15:24,233
..l...

670
01:15:26,151 --> 01:15:27,820
..am a poet.

671
01:15:27,986 --> 01:15:31,615
- The night has fallen, Rodrigo.
- The...

672
01:15:31,782 --> 01:15:33,283
Hold it! Hold it! Mona...

673
01:15:33,450 --> 01:15:36,328
Give us a moment.
I'd like a word with Dolores.

674
01:15:38,163 --> 01:15:42,459
When you say "your larking charms",
use your charms for the hunter.

675
01:15:42,626 --> 01:15:44,545
Because you're the witch.

676
01:15:44,711 --> 01:15:47,214
You're bringing the hunter to your lair.

677
01:15:49,007 --> 01:15:51,009
- Hi, Mr Humbert.
- Hello, Mona.

678
01:15:52,177 --> 01:15:53,971
Some play, huh?

679
01:15:54,138 --> 01:15:56,974
You're nymphs.
Use your nymph's charms.

680
01:15:57,141 --> 01:15:58,559
Seduce the hunter.

681
01:15:58,725 --> 01:16:00,727
Look. See right there?

682
01:16:01,645 --> 01:16:06,066
That's the actual playwright, Clare Quilty.
Can you believe it?

683
01:16:06,233 --> 01:16:08,694
Let the music transform you.

684
01:16:08,861 --> 01:16:11,405
You'll feel that you've become a witch.

685
01:16:11,572 --> 01:16:15,284
- You're a witch!

686
01:16:15,450 --> 01:16:18,704
- This play any good, Mona?
- Yeah. It's very political.

687
01:16:18,871 --> 01:16:20,873
Witch! Witch!

688
01:16:21,039 --> 01:16:23,000
More wind! More wind!

689
01:16:23,167 --> 01:16:24,835
You're a witch!

690
01:16:25,002 --> 01:16:27,004
Aren't you?

691
01:16:27,171 --> 01:16:29,173
More wind! I need more wind!

692
01:16:30,382 --> 01:16:32,593
The witches now! The witches' dance!

693
01:16:32,759 --> 01:16:34,136
In the wind!

694
01:16:39,016 --> 01:16:41,935
As she grew cooler
towards my advances,...

695
01:16:42,102 --> 01:16:45,439
..l became accustomed
to purchasing her favours.

696
01:16:46,273 --> 01:16:49,234
Where she hid the money, I never knew.

697
01:16:50,194 --> 01:16:51,153
Stop it!

698
01:16:51,320 --> 01:16:55,866
I was convinced she was storing it away
in order to finance her escape from me.

699
01:16:58,994 --> 01:17:02,414
You can't expect me to pay extra
in the middle!

700
01:17:02,581 --> 01:17:04,333
Ow! Argh!

701
01:17:04,500 --> 01:17:07,211
She's a lovely child, Mr Haze,...

702
01:17:07,377 --> 01:17:11,715
..but the onset of sexual maturing
seems to be giving her trouble.

703
01:17:11,882 --> 01:17:16,094
- Isn't that your observation, Reverend?
- To the tee, Miss Pratt.

704
01:17:16,261 --> 01:17:20,724
So, you see, it is the general impression
that 14-year-old Dolores...

705
01:17:20,891 --> 01:17:25,103
..is morbidly disinterested
in sexual matters.

706
01:17:25,270 --> 01:17:28,524
Does she never speak
about these... matters?

707
01:17:28,690 --> 01:17:30,359
Well...

708
01:17:30,526 --> 01:17:32,486
That's just it.

709
01:17:41,078 --> 01:17:42,454
What's just it?

710
01:17:42,621 --> 01:17:44,623
That's... just it.

711
01:17:44,790 --> 01:17:47,000
She hasn't said anything.

712
01:17:47,167 --> 01:17:49,461
She hasn't breathed a word.

713
01:17:52,297 --> 01:17:54,299
Uh... But who has?

714
01:17:58,011 --> 01:18:00,806
Are... Are you saying that I've...

715
01:18:00,973 --> 01:18:02,975
Exactly.

716
01:18:03,142 --> 01:18:05,602
This is a very serious matter.

717
01:18:05,769 --> 01:18:07,855
What we're trying to say to you...

718
01:18:08,021 --> 01:18:10,440
..is that someone in the family,...

719
01:18:10,607 --> 01:18:12,818
..maybe you,...

720
01:18:12,985 --> 01:18:15,571
This is very difficult for me.

721
01:18:15,737 --> 01:18:17,781
Well, let me put it this way.

722
01:18:17,948 --> 01:18:21,952
Someone in the family
ought to instruct that dear child...

723
01:18:22,119 --> 01:18:24,538
..in the process of human reproduction.

724
01:18:24,705 --> 01:18:26,373
I'm so sorry.

725
01:18:26,540 --> 01:18:29,334
- I'm so sorry.
- I see that I've embarrassed you.

726
01:18:29,501 --> 01:18:33,005
Yet you, as her father,
ought to take the matter well in hand.

727
01:18:33,172 --> 01:18:36,216
Yes. Worry not, Miss Pratt.

728
01:18:38,552 --> 01:18:40,888
I... um... I have... this matter in hand.

729
01:18:41,054 --> 01:18:42,806
Oh, well,...

730
01:18:42,973 --> 01:18:45,517
..that's all I need to say.

731
01:18:56,778 --> 01:18:57,738
Yes?

732
01:18:59,031 --> 01:19:00,616
Oh, yes?

733
01:19:02,951 --> 01:19:04,536
She missed?

734
01:19:06,538 --> 01:19:08,040
Oh.

735
01:19:08,624 --> 01:19:10,000
Bye.

736
01:19:18,133 --> 01:19:20,219
How are the piano lessons going?

737
01:19:20,385 --> 01:19:22,387
Fine.

738
01:19:22,554 --> 01:19:25,474
Great. Excellent. Wonderful.

739
01:19:25,641 --> 01:19:27,643
Terrif. Perfect.

740
01:19:27,810 --> 01:19:30,270
Especially since you missed the last two.

741
01:19:35,108 --> 01:19:37,110
Where were you?

742
01:19:42,574 --> 01:19:44,576
Where was l?

743
01:19:44,743 --> 01:19:46,995
I should have told you before.

744
01:19:49,414 --> 01:19:52,835
I was in the park.
I was rehearsing the play with Mona.

745
01:19:53,001 --> 01:19:55,003
That's your story?

746
01:19:55,170 --> 01:19:57,172
That's what I was doing.

747
01:19:58,090 --> 01:20:00,092
OK. Give me Mona's phone number.

748
01:20:00,259 --> 01:20:04,429
- Mona's phone number?
- Just give me Mona's phone number.

749
01:20:04,596 --> 01:20:07,307
Klausen 57241 .

750
01:20:21,113 --> 01:20:23,115
Is Mona there, please?

751
01:20:24,241 --> 01:20:28,370
- Mona, this is Dolores's father.
- Oh, hello, sir.

752
01:20:28,537 --> 01:20:30,539
Mona, were you and Dolores...

753
01:20:30,706 --> 01:20:34,751
..rehearsing the play in the park
for the past two Tuesday afternoons?

754
01:20:34,918 --> 01:20:36,503
Um... Let's see.

755
01:20:36,670 --> 01:20:38,213
The last two Tuesdays?

756
01:20:38,380 --> 01:20:41,842
One of them, Mona, was yesterday.

757
01:20:42,009 --> 01:20:44,803
You know, sir, that's... absolutely right.

758
01:20:44,970 --> 01:20:46,972
I feel awfully bad about it.

759
01:20:47,139 --> 01:20:49,016
I alone am to blame, sir.

760
01:20:49,183 --> 01:20:52,478
The whole rehearsing in the park thing
was my idea.

761
01:20:52,644 --> 01:20:55,689
We did it cos we didn't want
to get on your nerves.

762
01:21:02,237 --> 01:21:04,239
Well?

763
01:21:04,406 --> 01:21:06,700
Did she confirm?

764
01:21:06,867 --> 01:21:08,869
She did.

765
01:21:09,036 --> 01:21:12,372
And I've no doubt
she'd been well instructed by you.

766
01:21:15,250 --> 01:21:18,921
In fact, I've no doubt
you've told her all about us.

767
01:21:25,844 --> 01:21:27,679
Look, Lo, this has got to stop.

768
01:21:27,846 --> 01:21:31,433
I don't know what you're up to,
but whatever it is,...

769
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:36,438
..l'll yank you out of Beardsley as fast as
I can pack a suitcase unless this stops!

770
01:21:36,605 --> 01:21:37,981
Unless what stops?

771
01:21:38,148 --> 01:21:40,651
- You know what!
- Take it easy, mister!

772
01:21:40,818 --> 01:21:44,238
- Show me every penny...
- Leave me alone, you pervert!

773
01:21:44,404 --> 01:21:48,700
- You're running away from me, I know.
- Yes, I am! Anyone'd run away from you!

774
01:21:48,867 --> 01:21:51,328
- Show me what you hid!
- I earned that money!

775
01:21:57,960 --> 01:22:01,004
Go ahead, murder me.
Like you murdered my mother.

776
01:22:01,171 --> 01:22:02,047
I'm sorry.

777
01:22:02,214 --> 01:22:04,591
Murder me like you murdered my mother!

778
01:22:04,758 --> 01:22:05,759
Shut up. Shut up!

779
01:22:05,926 --> 01:22:08,470
Murder me like you murdered my mother!

780
01:22:08,637 --> 01:22:10,806
- Stop that!
- Go ahead! Murder me!

781
01:22:10,973 --> 01:22:13,851
Go on, murder me!
I'm asking you to murder me!

782
01:22:14,017 --> 01:22:16,019
- Shut up!
- Murder me! Murder me!

783
01:22:16,186 --> 01:22:19,815
- Dolores, shut up!
- I hate you! I hate you!

784
01:22:19,982 --> 01:22:21,984
Calm down.

785
01:22:22,151 --> 01:22:23,819
- Calm down!

786
01:22:23,986 --> 01:22:26,864
- Come back, Lo!

787
01:22:27,030 --> 01:22:29,700
Murderer!

788
01:22:29,867 --> 01:22:31,201
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

789
01:22:32,536 --> 01:22:34,371
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

790
01:22:42,337 --> 01:22:46,800
I do not know who you people think
you are, screaming and carrying on!

791
01:22:46,967 --> 01:22:50,304
My daughter's friend.
I'm sorry. I really can't stay.

792
01:24:15,556 --> 01:24:18,559
Oh, good. I was just trying
to reach you at home.

793
01:24:18,725 --> 01:24:21,603
- I've come to a decision.
- You have?

794
01:24:21,770 --> 01:24:23,564
Yeah.

795
01:24:23,730 --> 01:24:25,732
So buy me a drink.

796
01:24:25,899 --> 01:24:27,901
What would you like?

797
01:24:28,068 --> 01:24:30,237
Um... I'd like, uh, ice-cream soda...

798
01:24:30,404 --> 01:24:32,406
..with extra chocolate syrup.

799
01:24:32,573 --> 01:24:34,575
Please.

800
01:24:36,285 --> 01:24:38,954
Nothing for me, thanks.

801
01:24:53,010 --> 01:24:53,969
Lo...

802
01:25:15,199 --> 01:25:16,783
So tell me.

803
01:25:22,998 --> 01:25:25,292
What's the rush?

804
01:25:42,184 --> 01:25:44,603
Pay her and let's blow this joint.

805
01:26:00,994 --> 01:26:02,996
And do you know what she said,...

806
01:26:03,163 --> 01:26:06,333
..this girl who had been spurning me,
mocking me,...

807
01:26:06,500 --> 01:26:09,586
..plotting her escape from me
only hours before?

808
01:26:09,753 --> 01:26:13,090
She said she wanted
to leave Beardsley then and there.

809
01:26:13,257 --> 01:26:15,467
She wanted to take another trip,...

810
01:26:15,634 --> 01:26:18,762
..only this time she would choose
where we would go.

811
01:26:18,929 --> 01:26:21,598
- OK? I choose? OK?
- Yes.

812
01:26:22,266 --> 01:26:24,685
Did Humbert hum his assent?

813
01:26:24,852 --> 01:26:26,854
Oh, yes.

814
01:26:27,020 --> 01:26:29,022
I sealed my fate gratefully.

815
01:27:10,355 --> 01:27:12,357
Lolita.

816
01:27:15,736 --> 01:27:17,988
Take me to bed.

817
01:27:40,052 --> 01:27:42,554
Look out for cigarette hangover.

818
01:27:42,721 --> 01:27:44,389
Hi. I'm Clare Quilty.

819
01:27:44,556 --> 01:27:46,892
Remember, over a million smokers...

820
01:27:47,059 --> 01:27:49,061
So we have to be in...

821
01:27:50,103 --> 01:27:52,105
..Wace in exactly one week.

822
01:27:52,272 --> 01:27:54,358
But why Wace in a week?

823
01:27:54,525 --> 01:27:59,655
Cos we gotta see the... ceremonial dances
when they open the Magic Caves.

824
01:27:59,822 --> 01:28:03,200
And... exactly two weeks
and four days later,...

825
01:28:03,367 --> 01:28:05,911
..we have to arrive in Elphinstone. See?

826
01:28:07,996 --> 01:28:09,498
Yes.

827
01:28:09,665 --> 01:28:11,834
That's where we climb the Red Rock.

828
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:15,838
We have to climb this rock
exactly two weeks and four days later?

829
01:28:16,004 --> 01:28:18,006
Exactly.

830
01:28:18,173 --> 01:28:20,175
Oh, I'm so excited.

831
01:28:43,115 --> 01:28:48,328
I cannot tell you the exact day I first knew
for certain that we were being followed.

832
01:29:09,683 --> 01:29:13,770
Lo, reach into the glove compartment
and get the pad and pencil.

833
01:29:18,066 --> 01:29:20,944
Got it? Now write this down.

834
01:29:22,112 --> 01:29:23,906
Connecticut.

835
01:29:24,072 --> 01:29:25,449
How do you spell that?

836
01:29:25,616 --> 01:29:27,075
C-O-N-N.

837
01:29:27,242 --> 01:29:28,744
Is that it?

838
01:29:28,911 --> 01:29:30,496
No. Now write down...

839
01:29:30,662 --> 01:29:32,164
..PJ...

840
01:29:32,331 --> 01:29:34,291
..44...

841
01:29:34,458 --> 01:29:36,335
..396.

842
01:29:37,794 --> 01:29:39,546
All right, give it to me.

843
01:29:45,302 --> 01:29:46,845
All right.

844
01:29:47,012 --> 01:29:50,432
Put it in the glove box.
Don't put gum on it cos it'll get...

845
01:29:50,599 --> 01:29:52,935
Why have you got your gum everywhere?

846
01:29:53,101 --> 01:29:54,728
Put that in the glove box.

847
01:29:55,729 --> 01:29:57,815
There's a detective following us.

848
01:30:00,317 --> 01:30:02,736
He looks rather like my Uncle Gustave.

849
01:30:14,373 --> 01:30:16,375
He was clever, ourpursuer.

850
01:30:16,542 --> 01:30:18,544
He kept changing cars.

851
01:30:18,710 --> 01:30:20,921
But his presence was as real to me...

852
01:30:21,088 --> 01:30:23,090
..as my own breath.

853
01:30:28,804 --> 01:30:33,642
Then suddenly he would disappear
and I'd wonder ifl'd imagined everything.

854
01:31:51,470 --> 01:31:53,222
Lo! What did that man say to you?

855
01:31:53,388 --> 01:31:56,433
# Bags around your eyeballs
which is red instead of white

856
01:31:56,600 --> 01:31:59,686
- What did he say to you?
- The guy I was talking to?

857
01:31:59,853 --> 01:32:02,523
- Yeah. Look...
- # Shucks, I shoulda known...

858
01:32:02,648 --> 01:32:04,650
Just tell me what he said to you.

859
01:32:04,817 --> 01:32:07,694
He asked me if I had a map.
He must've been lost.

860
01:32:07,861 --> 01:32:09,863
# My heart's plumb gone

861
01:32:10,030 --> 01:32:12,282
# Cos you used temptation

862
01:32:13,492 --> 01:32:16,620
# It'd be thrilling... if'n you're willing

863
01:32:16,787 --> 01:32:21,458
Look, I've told you about
talking to strangers. You've no idea...

864
01:32:21,625 --> 01:32:23,627
Lo, listen to me.

865
01:32:23,794 --> 01:32:27,464
You're very young
and people can take advantage of you.

866
01:32:27,631 --> 01:32:29,633
Very hard to imagine.

867
01:32:29,800 --> 01:32:32,594
That man was the cop
who's been following us.

868
01:32:32,761 --> 01:32:35,556
You have to tell me
exactly what you told him.

869
01:32:35,722 --> 01:32:40,144
If he really is a cop, the worst thing
we can do is let him know we're scared.

870
01:32:40,310 --> 01:32:42,479
Then he'll know that we're guilty.

871
01:32:42,646 --> 01:32:44,648
Or rather, that you're guilty.

872
01:32:54,324 --> 01:32:58,787
# Don't sit under the apple tree
with anyone else but me...

873
01:33:07,087 --> 01:33:09,089
# With anyone else but me

874
01:33:09,256 --> 01:33:12,050
# With anyone else but me, no, no, no

875
01:33:39,328 --> 01:33:41,497
# With anyone else but me, no, no, no

876
01:33:41,663 --> 01:33:43,582
# Anyone else but you

877
01:33:43,749 --> 01:33:46,752
# No, no, don't go under the apple tree

878
01:33:51,423 --> 01:33:54,510
There's something wrong
with the steering.

879
01:33:54,676 --> 01:33:56,762
Oh, whoa!

880
01:33:56,929 --> 01:33:58,263
Ow! Watch it!

881
01:33:59,389 --> 01:34:01,225
What are you doing?!

882
01:34:06,855 --> 01:34:08,732
You got a flat, mister.

883
01:34:40,347 --> 01:34:42,349
# Open the door, and let me in

884
01:34:48,438 --> 01:34:50,607
# Richard, why don't you open the door?

885
01:35:04,079 --> 01:35:05,581
Hey...

886
01:35:05,747 --> 01:35:07,332
Hey!

887
01:35:07,499 --> 01:35:09,293
Hey, you! Come back here!

888
01:35:11,879 --> 01:35:12,838
Lo!

889
01:35:13,005 --> 01:35:14,381
Lo! Lo!

890
01:35:14,548 --> 01:35:15,507
Lo!

891
01:35:15,674 --> 01:35:17,092
Put on the handbrake!

892
01:35:17,259 --> 01:35:19,803
Pull the handbrake up! Lo!

893
01:35:22,055 --> 01:35:25,184
Lo! Pull on the handbrake. Stop the car.

894
01:35:25,350 --> 01:35:28,270
Put the handbrake on. Down there! Pull it!

895
01:35:28,437 --> 01:35:29,938
- Ow!

896
01:35:31,315 --> 01:35:32,399
Jesus Christ!

897
01:35:32,566 --> 01:35:35,277
What did you think you were doing?

898
01:35:35,444 --> 01:35:37,446
You should thank me.

899
01:35:37,613 --> 01:35:39,865
The car was rolling and I stopped it.

900
01:35:42,701 --> 01:35:45,370
You should thank me.

901
01:35:49,208 --> 01:35:52,085
Pass me the pad
in the glove compartment.

902
01:35:54,546 --> 01:35:57,382
It was smart of us
to write his number down.

903
01:36:00,844 --> 01:36:02,221
What...?

904
01:36:02,387 --> 01:36:04,056
What have you...

905
01:36:16,193 --> 01:36:17,778
Lo...

906
01:36:32,125 --> 01:36:34,128
Lo...

907
01:36:39,383 --> 01:36:41,385
Lo, I'm sorry.

908
01:36:41,552 --> 01:36:44,221
- I'm sorry!

909
01:36:51,937 --> 01:36:54,606
Come here. Come here.

910
01:36:54,731 --> 01:36:56,733
Get away!

911
01:36:58,235 --> 01:37:00,445
Lo...

912
01:37:00,612 --> 01:37:02,614
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

913
01:37:02,781 --> 01:37:04,241
I'm sorry.

914
01:37:29,183 --> 01:37:32,269
Shall I walk down to the town
and get you some fruit?

915
01:37:33,395 --> 01:37:35,397
Bananas.

916
01:37:44,281 --> 01:37:46,283
Just bananas?

917
01:37:47,618 --> 01:37:50,537
Just bananas.

918
01:38:02,090 --> 01:38:05,219
# Open the door, Richard

919
01:38:05,385 --> 01:38:08,889
# Open the door and let me in

920
01:38:09,056 --> 01:38:11,725
# Open the door, Richard

921
01:38:11,850 --> 01:38:16,563
- # Richard...
- # Why don't you open that door?

922
01:38:25,697 --> 01:38:29,827
# Borrow confidently from HFC

923
01:38:29,993 --> 01:38:34,623
Quilty can't be here in our studio
because he's in Wace, Texas tonight...

924
01:38:34,790 --> 01:38:37,793
..working on the premiere
of his brand-new play.

925
01:38:37,960 --> 01:38:40,796
But I want to welcome
his writing partner,...

926
01:38:40,963 --> 01:38:44,091
..the lovely and talented
Miss Vivian Darkbloom.

927
01:38:44,258 --> 01:38:46,468
Let's give her a warm Texas welcome.

928
01:39:16,915 --> 01:39:19,084
You've been out.

929
01:39:20,210 --> 01:39:22,212
I just got up.

930
01:39:27,342 --> 01:39:29,344
Don't lie to me.

931
01:39:33,515 --> 01:39:35,517
Well, I did go out for a second.

932
01:39:36,727 --> 01:39:40,522
You were gone so long.
I wanted to see if you were coming back.

933
01:40:30,364 --> 01:40:33,325
You tell me who it is! Who is it?

934
01:40:33,492 --> 01:40:35,994
Who is it? Tell me who it is.

935
01:40:37,996 --> 01:40:40,415
You tell me. Who is it?

936
01:40:41,416 --> 01:40:42,334
Who...?

937
01:40:42,501 --> 01:40:45,295
- Tell me.

938
01:40:45,462 --> 01:40:46,547
Please, tell me.

939
01:40:58,767 --> 01:41:00,394
Please tell me.

940
01:41:00,561 --> 01:41:02,563
Please tell me.

941
01:41:14,324 --> 01:41:16,118
Please tell me.

942
01:41:18,287 --> 01:41:19,830
Please!

943
01:41:19,997 --> 01:41:21,832
Please... tell... me!

944
01:41:21,999 --> 01:41:24,001
Please... please...

945
01:41:25,043 --> 01:41:27,045
Please...

946
01:41:27,212 --> 01:41:29,214
..tell me!

947
01:41:29,381 --> 01:41:30,591
Please...

948
01:41:30,757 --> 01:41:31,967
..please...

949
01:41:32,134 --> 01:41:33,469
..please...

950
01:43:20,576 --> 01:43:22,578
I'll show you to room number 29.

951
01:43:22,744 --> 01:43:24,746
It's one of our nicer rooms.

952
01:43:24,913 --> 01:43:28,292
Say, what's wrong
with your little daughter? ls she ill?

953
01:43:28,459 --> 01:43:30,878
Oh, no. She's just feeling a bit... um...

954
01:43:34,840 --> 01:43:36,425
My God, Lo!

955
01:43:36,592 --> 01:43:38,177
Are you all right?

956
01:43:39,178 --> 01:43:41,847
I don't feel... I don't feel very well.

957
01:43:42,681 --> 01:43:44,683
It's a virus.

958
01:43:44,850 --> 01:43:47,936
Nothing serious.
I've had 40 cases in two weeks.

959
01:43:48,103 --> 01:43:51,773
- So can I take her home?
- We're gonna keep her here overnight.

960
01:43:51,940 --> 01:43:54,109
Keep her hydrated, help her sleep.

961
01:44:05,329 --> 01:44:08,874
Why don't you get some sleep?
It won't help if you catch it.

962
01:44:09,041 --> 01:44:11,502
I think I have already.
I feel dreadful.

963
01:44:11,668 --> 01:44:13,670
- Maybe I should stay.
- Go.

964
01:44:13,837 --> 01:44:15,756
Call us in the morning.

965
01:44:15,923 --> 01:44:18,133
- Here, I'll take those.
- Thank you.

966
01:44:48,121 --> 01:44:50,249
Uh, yes, hello. This is Mr Humbert.

967
01:44:50,415 --> 01:44:54,336
I'm calling to see how my... daughter,
Dolores Haze, is.

968
01:44:54,503 --> 01:44:56,505
Oh, she's much better.

969
01:44:56,672 --> 01:44:58,966
She was up early. No trace of fever.

970
01:44:59,133 --> 01:45:02,386
And when Uncle Gustave came for her,
we signed her out.

971
01:45:04,138 --> 01:45:06,807
Who? Wh... Wh... Who?

972
01:45:06,932 --> 01:45:09,184
Uncle Gustave, Dolores called him.

973
01:45:09,351 --> 01:45:12,980
He had a sweet little dog.
He was the nicest man. Had a big smile.

974
01:45:13,147 --> 01:45:14,523
Wait, Ted.

975
01:45:14,690 --> 01:45:18,735
- And you let her go with him?
- Oh, yes. He paid the bill in cash.

976
01:45:18,902 --> 01:45:23,740
They said to tell you not to worry,
and they'll be at Grandpa's expecting you.

977
01:45:23,907 --> 01:45:27,578
- Then they went off in that nice Cadillac.

978
01:45:27,744 --> 01:45:29,746
Hello?

979
01:45:47,848 --> 01:45:49,391
Hey!

980
01:45:49,558 --> 01:45:51,226
Hey!

981
01:46:01,111 --> 01:46:02,070
Nurse!

982
01:46:02,237 --> 01:46:04,239
- Where is she?
- Who?

983
01:46:04,406 --> 01:46:06,867
Who took her?
Somebody took my daughter.

984
01:46:07,034 --> 01:46:09,995
- You need to talk to the doctor.
- But who took her?

985
01:46:10,162 --> 01:46:12,331
My daughter was in there last night.

986
01:46:12,498 --> 01:46:14,792
- Who took her away?
- Hey, relax, pal!

987
01:46:14,958 --> 01:46:18,420
Don't tell me to relax!
I'm looking for my daughter! Doctor!

988
01:46:18,587 --> 01:46:20,297
Doctor! Doctor!

989
01:46:20,464 --> 01:46:22,466
What have you done with her?

990
01:46:22,633 --> 01:46:24,718
Where is she? Where is she?

991
01:46:24,927 --> 01:46:27,638
Tell me where she is! Where is she?

992
01:46:27,805 --> 01:46:30,390
Where has she gone?
Where? Where? Where?

993
01:46:32,851 --> 01:46:34,937
You leave me alone, you bastards!

994
01:46:35,103 --> 01:46:36,814
You fucking fiends!

995
01:46:36,980 --> 01:46:38,982
Tell me where she is!

996
01:46:41,235 --> 01:46:43,237
Get me to that man!

997
01:46:45,113 --> 01:46:47,658
I'm just looking for my daughter!

998
01:46:48,826 --> 01:46:52,371
- I said relax!
- I want to know where she -

999
01:46:54,331 --> 01:46:57,042
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Sorry, sorry, sorry.

1000
01:46:57,209 --> 01:46:58,669
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1001
01:46:58,836 --> 01:47:00,546
Sorry.

1002
01:47:00,712 --> 01:47:02,881
I'm sorry. I'm just a little bit...

1003
01:47:03,048 --> 01:47:06,927
I think I may just have...
had a little too much to drink. Sorry.

1004
01:47:07,094 --> 01:47:10,389
I'm very worried
about my daughter, you see.

1005
01:47:10,556 --> 01:47:13,016
But she's with her Uncle Gustave.

1006
01:47:13,183 --> 01:47:15,185
So she'll be all right.

1007
01:47:15,352 --> 01:47:17,521
I'm very sorry. Please forgive me.

1008
01:47:17,688 --> 01:47:20,023
She's gone to her... grandpa's farm.

1009
01:47:21,150 --> 01:47:23,235
She'll be absolutely fine there.

1010
01:47:23,402 --> 01:47:25,404
What better place for her?

1011
01:47:25,571 --> 01:47:27,906
I'm... I'm fine.

1012
01:47:28,073 --> 01:47:30,075
Please, I'm sorry.

1013
01:47:30,242 --> 01:47:32,244
So sorry. Thank you very much.

1014
01:47:32,411 --> 01:47:34,413
Sorry... Sorry.

1015
01:47:34,580 --> 01:47:36,582
So sorry.

1016
01:47:51,638 --> 01:47:53,640
I searched all our old haunts...

1017
01:47:53,807 --> 01:47:57,394
..and for several months
the trail remained warm.

1018
01:47:59,980 --> 01:48:04,359
The thief, the kidnapper,
whatever you want to call him,...

1019
01:48:04,526 --> 01:48:06,195
..he was clever.

1020
01:48:06,361 --> 01:48:08,363
He would disguise his name.

1021
01:48:08,530 --> 01:48:11,074
But I could always tell his handwriting.

1022
01:48:12,576 --> 01:48:14,369
Um... Sir!

1023
01:48:18,624 --> 01:48:20,709
He had very peculiar Ts, Ws and Ls.

1024
01:48:20,876 --> 01:48:23,378
Do you know his name?

1025
01:48:24,963 --> 01:48:26,965
What does he look like?

1026
01:48:29,426 --> 01:48:31,428
- Let me help.
- No, please...

1027
01:48:33,430 --> 01:48:36,016
Ladies, I'm sorry. We're trying to find...

1028
01:48:36,183 --> 01:48:39,436
It must be hard
for you who already know who it was...

1029
01:48:39,603 --> 01:48:41,855
..to understand my mystification.

1030
01:48:50,447 --> 01:48:53,116
Or maybe you think
I was imagining things.

1031
01:48:53,283 --> 01:48:54,868
..my daughter.

1032
01:48:56,161 --> 01:49:00,874
Maybe you think it impossible that
there could have been another like me.

1033
01:49:01,041 --> 01:49:05,838
Another mad lover ofnymphets following
us over the great and uglyplains.

1034
01:49:06,004 --> 01:49:08,215
Well, you are right, ofcourse.

1035
01:49:08,382 --> 01:49:10,384
There was no-one else like me.

1036
01:49:19,643 --> 01:49:22,187
Eventually the trail went cold and dead.

1037
01:49:26,483 --> 01:49:29,153
And I went back to cold, dead Beardsley.

1038
01:50:23,832 --> 01:50:26,710
"Dear Dad, how's everything?"

1039
01:50:27,711 --> 01:50:30,130
"I'm married. I'm going to have a baby."

1040
01:50:32,466 --> 01:50:35,177
"I guess it'll come
right around Christmas."

1041
01:50:37,137 --> 01:50:39,264
"This is a hard letter to write."

1042
01:50:39,431 --> 01:50:42,392
"I'm going nuts
because we don't have enough...

1043
01:50:42,559 --> 01:50:44,895
..to pay our debts and get out ofhere."

1044
01:50:46,438 --> 01:50:49,191
"Dick has been promised
a bigjob in Alaska."

1045
01:50:51,777 --> 01:50:53,779
"Are you still mad at me?"

1046
01:50:54,988 --> 01:50:59,910
"Please send us a cheque, Dad. We could
manage with three or four hundred,...

1047
01:51:00,077 --> 01:51:02,454
..or even less. Anything is welcome."

1048
01:51:03,247 --> 01:51:06,416
"I have gone through
much sadness and hardship."

1049
01:51:06,583 --> 01:51:08,585
"Yours expecting, Dolly."

1050
01:51:10,254 --> 01:51:12,256
"Mrs Richard F...

1051
01:51:14,383 --> 01:51:16,385
..Schiller."

1052
01:52:35,798 --> 01:52:38,175
Well!

1053
01:53:09,039 --> 01:53:11,041
Come in.

1054
01:53:24,012 --> 01:53:26,014
You, Molly, stay out.

1055
01:53:26,181 --> 01:53:28,016
Good girl.

1056
01:53:28,183 --> 01:53:30,602
Husband at home?

1057
01:53:30,769 --> 01:53:32,563
Yeah.

1058
01:53:32,729 --> 01:53:35,691
Where do you wanna sit?
The rocker or the divan?

1059
01:53:36,775 --> 01:53:38,777
Come sit with me on the divan.

1060
01:53:45,659 --> 01:53:47,244
Is that him?

1061
01:53:48,704 --> 01:53:50,664
Up the ladder?

1062
01:53:50,831 --> 01:53:53,500
You want me to call him in?

1063
01:53:54,418 --> 01:53:56,170
No.

1064
01:53:56,336 --> 01:53:59,006
He's not the one I want.

1065
01:54:00,757 --> 01:54:03,051
He's not the what?

1066
01:54:03,218 --> 01:54:05,345
You know what I mean.

1067
01:54:05,512 --> 01:54:07,723
Where is he?

1068
01:54:07,890 --> 01:54:09,892
Look...

1069
01:54:10,476 --> 01:54:15,022
Dick has nothing to do with all that stuff.
He thinks you're my father.

1070
01:54:15,189 --> 01:54:17,441
Please don't bring up all that muck.

1071
01:54:19,193 --> 01:54:22,529
- All right, I'll find out myself.
- You really don't know?

1072
01:54:29,787 --> 01:54:31,789
My God, Dad, it was Quilty.

1073
01:54:31,955 --> 01:54:34,082
It was Clare Quilty.

1074
01:54:42,216 --> 01:54:44,218
Yes.

1075
01:54:49,723 --> 01:54:51,850
Yes, of course.

1076
01:55:10,911 --> 01:55:12,704
Quilty.

1077
01:55:13,831 --> 01:55:15,833
Yeah.

1078
01:55:18,043 --> 01:55:21,713
He was the only man
I was ever really crazy about.

1079
01:55:26,510 --> 01:55:28,720
What about me?

1080
01:55:56,290 --> 01:55:58,292
Where did he take you?

1081
01:56:02,337 --> 01:56:04,590
Just tell me.

1082
01:56:05,799 --> 01:56:08,635
Well, everybody knew he liked little girls.

1083
01:56:08,802 --> 01:56:13,682
He used to film them in his mansion
over in Parkington, Pavor Manor.

1084
01:56:16,143 --> 01:56:19,313
But I wasn't gonna do all those things.

1085
01:56:20,814 --> 01:56:22,816
All what things?

1086
01:56:22,983 --> 01:56:25,068
Two girls and two boys or...

1087
01:56:25,235 --> 01:56:27,321
..l don't know, three or four men.

1088
01:56:27,488 --> 01:56:29,948
And Vivian was filming the whole thing.

1089
01:56:30,115 --> 01:56:33,952
I said "No, I'm not gonna blow
all those beastly boys."

1090
01:56:34,119 --> 01:56:36,246
"I want you."

1091
01:56:39,583 --> 01:56:41,460
So he threw me out.

1092
01:56:51,220 --> 01:56:53,222
I looked and looked at her...

1093
01:56:55,265 --> 01:56:58,560
..and I knew,
as clearly as I know that I will die,...

1094
01:56:58,727 --> 01:57:03,315
..that I loved her more than anything
I'd ever seen or imagined on earth.

1095
01:57:07,444 --> 01:57:11,406
She was only the dead leafecho
of the nymphet from long ago...

1096
01:57:12,658 --> 01:57:15,035
..but I loved her, this Lolita,...

1097
01:57:15,202 --> 01:57:18,664
..pale andpolluted
and big with another man's child.

1098
01:57:18,831 --> 01:57:22,000
She could fade and wither - I didn't care.

1099
01:57:24,002 --> 01:57:26,672
I would still go mad with tenderness...

1100
01:57:26,797 --> 01:57:28,799
..at the mere sight ofher face.

1101
01:57:52,322 --> 01:57:54,324
Lolita...

1102
01:57:56,618 --> 01:58:00,706
From here to that old car
that you know so well...

1103
01:58:00,873 --> 01:58:03,125
..is a stretch of 25 paces.

1104
01:58:05,919 --> 01:58:08,422
Make those 25 steps...

1105
01:58:08,589 --> 01:58:10,591
..with me, now.

1106
01:58:10,757 --> 01:58:15,179
You're saying you'll give us some money
if I go to a motel with you?

1107
01:58:15,345 --> 01:58:17,306
No... No!

1108
01:58:17,473 --> 01:58:21,977
I'm saying leave here and come live
with me, die with me, everything with me.

1109
01:58:23,145 --> 01:58:25,147
You're crazy.

1110
01:58:25,314 --> 01:58:28,025
If you refuse, you still get the money.

1111
01:58:28,192 --> 01:58:29,610
- Really?
- Yeah.

1112
01:58:31,403 --> 01:58:33,405
There. Have it.

1113
01:58:42,414 --> 01:58:44,291
Oh my God.

1114
01:58:44,458 --> 01:58:47,753
You're giving us four thousand bucks?

1115
01:58:51,006 --> 01:58:52,633
- Thank you...
- No...

1116
01:58:52,800 --> 01:58:54,802
Don't touch me.

1117
01:58:54,968 --> 01:58:56,970
I'll die if you touch me.

1118
01:58:58,305 --> 01:59:03,018
Just tell me...
there's a chance you'll come with me.

1119
01:59:04,812 --> 01:59:06,814
No, honey.

1120
01:59:06,980 --> 01:59:09,316
I'd almost rather go back with Clare.

1121
01:59:12,778 --> 01:59:14,780
Oh...

1122
01:59:14,947 --> 01:59:16,949
I'll go now.

1123
01:59:19,076 --> 01:59:23,413
- Can I call Dick in to say goodbye?
- No. I don't want to see him, at all.

1124
01:59:23,580 --> 01:59:26,625
I just want to go.

1125
01:59:36,093 --> 01:59:39,304
Lo, can you ever forget
what I've done to you?

1126
01:59:44,476 --> 01:59:46,478
Say goodbye, Molly.

1127
01:59:47,563 --> 01:59:49,565
Say goodbye to my dad.

1128
02:00:56,840 --> 02:00:58,926
Dick! Guess what!

1129
02:01:19,863 --> 02:01:22,199
Ladies and gentlemen ofthejury,...

1130
02:01:22,366 --> 02:01:27,287
..l have to say that I regret all I did
before that last goodbye in Coalmont.

1131
02:01:29,331 --> 02:01:32,918
But I regret nothing of what came after.

1132
02:03:08,889 --> 02:03:10,891
Now, who are you?

1133
02:03:14,686 --> 02:03:16,772
Are you, by any chance, Brewster?

1134
02:03:23,153 --> 02:03:25,948
You know, you don't look
like Jack Brewster.

1135
02:03:26,114 --> 02:03:29,618
I mean, the resemblance
is not particularly striking.

1136
02:03:29,785 --> 02:03:34,289
Somebody told me he had a brother
with the same phone company.

1137
02:03:34,456 --> 02:03:36,458
I'm neither of the Brewsters.

1138
02:03:43,507 --> 02:03:45,008
Pull over!

1139
02:03:46,093 --> 02:03:47,594
Pull over!

1140
02:03:50,806 --> 02:03:53,225
Do you recall a little girl named...

1141
02:03:55,060 --> 02:03:56,854
..Dolores Haze?

1142
02:04:01,066 --> 02:04:03,485
You see, I'm her father.

1143
02:04:04,862 --> 02:04:06,363
Nonsense.

1144
02:04:06,530 --> 02:04:09,992
You're a foreigner.
You're an agent of a foreign power.

1145
02:04:10,159 --> 02:04:12,244
You're a foreign literary agent.

1146
02:04:12,411 --> 02:04:14,830
She was my daughter.

1147
02:04:14,997 --> 02:04:16,999
She was my child.

1148
02:04:17,166 --> 02:04:19,543
Oh, you know, I adore children myself.

1149
02:04:19,710 --> 02:04:21,712
And fathers...

1150
02:04:21,879 --> 02:04:23,922
I love fathers.

1151
02:04:27,468 --> 02:04:29,261
Ah...

1152
02:04:29,428 --> 02:04:30,387
Sit down!

1153
02:04:32,097 --> 02:04:34,099
Oh. There they are.

1154
02:04:34,266 --> 02:04:36,518
Now we need matches. You got a light?

1155
02:04:36,685 --> 02:04:39,271
Quilty, I want you to concentrate.

1156
02:04:42,649 --> 02:04:44,318
You're about to die.

1157
02:04:44,485 --> 02:04:46,820
Ooh.

1158
02:04:54,787 --> 02:04:56,371
Jesus!

1159
02:04:57,748 --> 02:05:02,044
Do you want to be executed
standing up or sitting down?

1160
02:05:02,211 --> 02:05:05,631
Just let me think, let me think.
It's not an easy question.

1161
02:05:05,798 --> 02:05:08,258
Try to understand what is happening.

1162
02:05:08,425 --> 02:05:09,259
I-l-l-l...

1163
02:05:09,426 --> 02:05:12,805
- Remember Dolores Haze.
- I'm willing...

1164
02:05:12,971 --> 02:05:16,308
I'm willing to try. I am. Just...

1165
02:05:16,475 --> 02:05:18,143
OK. Listen.

1166
02:05:18,310 --> 02:05:20,312
I made a mistake, which I regret,...

1167
02:05:20,479 --> 02:05:22,397
..sincerely.

1168
02:05:22,564 --> 02:05:28,070
I couldn't have any fun with your Dolly.
I'm practically impotent is the sad truth.

1169
02:05:28,237 --> 02:05:32,950
But she had a swell vacation, met some
remarkable people. Hey, do you know -

1170
02:05:47,673 --> 02:05:49,133
Stay still!

1171
02:05:50,843 --> 02:05:52,803
Oh, God...

1172
02:05:53,637 --> 02:05:55,639
You cheated me.

1173
02:05:58,267 --> 02:06:00,269
You cheated me of my redemption.

1174
02:06:02,771 --> 02:06:06,441
- You have to die.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

1175
02:06:06,608 --> 02:06:10,445
My memory and my eloquence
are not at their best today.

1176
02:06:10,612 --> 02:06:14,950
But really, you have to admit
you were never an ideal stepfather.

1177
02:06:15,117 --> 02:06:17,119
Hm?

1178
02:06:17,286 --> 02:06:19,746
I did not force your protégée to join me.

1179
02:06:19,913 --> 02:06:22,916
It was she who made me
remove her to a happier home.

1180
02:06:23,083 --> 02:06:25,377
Look around you. See?

1181
02:06:25,544 --> 02:06:27,546
You see this house?

1182
02:06:27,713 --> 02:06:32,301
It's very cool in the summer. Comfortable.
I suggest that you move in, hm?

1183
02:06:35,137 --> 02:06:37,347
I think you'll be happy here.

1184
02:06:38,432 --> 02:06:40,434
You can use my wardrobe.

1185
02:06:41,393 --> 02:06:44,563
We have the most reliable
and bribable charwoman.

1186
02:06:44,730 --> 02:06:47,191
"Cleaning lady" is the American term.

1187
02:06:47,357 --> 02:06:50,944
She has not only daughters,
she has granddaughters.

1188
02:06:51,111 --> 02:06:54,406
And I know a thing or two
about the chief of police...

1189
02:06:54,573 --> 02:06:56,617
..that makes him my slave.

1190
02:06:56,784 --> 02:06:58,869
My slave. Drop the gun.

1191
02:06:59,036 --> 02:07:01,538
And here's another thing. Drop the gun.

1192
02:07:01,705 --> 02:07:05,584
I have, upstairs,
the most unique collection of erotica.

1193
02:07:05,751 --> 02:07:07,127
Drop the gun. Drop the gun.

1194
02:07:07,294 --> 02:07:11,423
Also, moreover, I can arrange
for you to attend executions.

1195
02:07:11,590 --> 02:07:14,593
Not everybody knows
the chair is painted yellow.

1196
02:07:17,095 --> 02:07:18,472
Somebody help!

1197
02:08:24,121 --> 02:08:25,789
Aargh! Agh!

1198
02:08:26,790 --> 02:08:28,792
That hurts, sir.

1199
02:08:28,959 --> 02:08:31,545
That hurts atrociously, my dear fellow.

1200
02:08:42,222 --> 02:08:44,224
God...

1201
02:08:44,391 --> 02:08:47,478
You should not continue
in this fashion, really.

1202
02:09:18,175 --> 02:09:19,968
Get out!

1203
02:09:20,135 --> 02:09:21,804
Get out of here!

1204
02:11:31,183 --> 02:11:34,561
What I heard then was
the melody ofchildren atplay.

1205
02:11:34,728 --> 02:11:36,730
Nothing but that.

1206
02:11:39,107 --> 02:11:42,277
And I knew that
the hopelesslypoignant thing...

1207
02:11:42,444 --> 02:11:45,280
..was not Lolita's absence from my side...

1208
02:11:46,949 --> 02:11:49,993
..but the absence ofher voice
from that chorus.
